Another Major Victory in the Anti-Imperialist Struggle
Representatives Li Weiguang and Hu Wenyao Speak on the Catholic Community's Support for the Judgment of the Gong Pinmei Traitorous Clique and American Spy Hua Lizhu

Chairman, fellow representatives:
    We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    Through the reports and discussions, as well as the inspections and visits in Jiangsu Province, we have profoundly realized that the current political, economic, scientific, and cultural situations in our country are extremely good. The 1960 National Economic Plan is still a comprehensive and better plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. The mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, which is sweeping the country, is flourishing under the glorious illumination of the General Line. The revolutionary energy and lofty ambitions of millions of workers and all working people on all fronts are inspiring. The production success reports of "Red Every Month" in the first quarter continue to pour in. This has created very favorable conditions for completing the 1960 National Economic Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, and has also brought a bright and happy future to the people of the whole country. All this is a great victory of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and a great victory of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We Catholics are deeply encouraged by this beautiful scene of brightness and hope everywhere, and we are also deeply honored and proud to live in such a great era.
    After liberation, the Chinese Catholic community launched an anti-imperialist patriotic movement, giving a heavy blow to the imperialists' various conspiracies to use religion to carry out aggression against our country. The recent judgment by the Shanghai Intermediate Court on the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu is another major victory in the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle and also the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of the Catholic community. Therefore, we would like to talk about our views and understanding of this case.
    Recently, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court successively held public trials and sentences for the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique and American spy Hua Lizhu. At the trial conference, we personally saw a large amount of conclusive evidence of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary traitorous clique, and personally heard the confessions of the fourteen traitors headed by Gong Pinmei. They admitted that they had been wearing religious cloaks, consistently sabotaging the implementation of various national political movements, policies, laws, and decrees, sabotaging the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics throughout the country, colluding with and harboring imperialist spies, stealing national secret intelligence, harboring secret agents and counter-revolutionaries; advocating the aggressive wars of American imperialism, and sabotaging the world peace movement. The veteran spy Hua Lizhu presided over the "Catholic Central Bureau," commanding imperialist spies and counter-revolutionaries hidden in the Catholic Church, and carrying out criminal activities to subvert our people's democratic regime in an organized and planned manner. Hua Lizhu also led the "Huaming News Agency" and the "Legion of Mary" and other reactionary organizations under the "Catholic Central Bureau," collecting our country's military, political, and economic intelligence, and frantically inciting Catholics and clergy to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government, in an attempt to achieve the goal of American imperialism invading China.
    Because the crimes of American spy Hua Lizhu and the Gong Pinmei-led counter-revolutionary traitorous clique are as solid as a mountain, we further realize that using Catholicism as an aggressive tool is one of the main conspiracies of American imperialism to invade our country, and that the Roman Curia is willing to be an accomplice of American imperialism, using religious cloaks as a cover to deploy international spy and secret service agencies and heinous spies and counter-revolutionaries under the control of American imperialism, and to serve the aggressive war policy of American imperialism. These facts all prove well that the Roman Curia faithfully acts as a running dog of American imperialism, conspiring to turn Chinese Catholicism into a tool for American aggression against China. However, the awakened Chinese Catholics and clergy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have more clearly recognized the reactionary nature and hideous face of the Roman Curia through these two cases. It is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and also the mortal enemy of Chinese Catholics. We must draw a clear line of demarcation with it, completely get rid of all its control, eliminate all its influence, and resolutely take the road of independent and self-managed churches.
    Because American spy Hua Lizhu was sanctioned by our country's laws, exposing the sabotage conspiracy of American imperialism, the US government was greatly annoyed and openly defended Hua Lizhu's espionage activities. US Secretary of State Herter issued a so-called "statement" and instructed his representative to shamelessly make a so-called "protest" in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks held in Warsaw, attempting to cover up Hua Lizhu's crimes and thus exonerate the American imperialism that instructed Hua Lizhu to engage in espionage and subversive activities. It is truly a guilty conscience, trying to cover up, but not only can it not exonerate the crime, but it further confirms that Hua Lizhu's criminal activities in China are precisely a link in the various conspiracies of the US government's consistent attempt to subvert the Chinese government. As the above-mentioned spy Hua Lizhu's criminal activities, what is "religious," and what does it have in common with religion? As for what is said about the "devotion" to the "spiritual welfare" of the believers, it is even more nonsense and not worth refuting. This veteran spy Hua Lizhu, what he wears is only a religious cloak, and what he does is the espionage crime activity under the religious cloak instructed by American imperialism, and there is nothing else. Our Shanghai People's Court sentenced such a heinous spy to imprisonment, and Catholics across the country applauded. The US government insists on linking this matter with religion and viciously slandering our government for "continuing to persecute religion," which is extremely absurd. As everyone knows, in our country, there is complete freedom of religious belief, and legitimate religious activities have always been protected by the Constitution and the state. But spies like Hua Lizhu, no matter what cloak he wears, have no freedom in our country and will be sanctioned by our country's laws. The convincing facts of the past ten years fully illustrate this point. The US government's attempt to deny Hua Lizhu's crimes by various despicable means is untenable; the dream of using religious belief to deceive the people of the world is also impossible. The legal dignity and all judicial rights of the People's Republic of China will never allow the intervention of American imperialists, and the awakened Chinese Catholics will never be exploited and deceived by American imperialism and the Roman Curia.
    Now American imperialism still occupies our territory Taiwan, and in the situation where the international tension is gradually easing, it is playing the two-faced trick of superficial peace and actual war preparation. At the same time, it continues to collude with the Roman Curia and continues to use Catholicism to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities against our country. Therefore, we Chinese Catholic clergy and believers must raise our vigilance, stand firm, strive for self-reform, continue to deepen the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, and no matter what tricks American imperialism and the Roman Curia play, we will resolutely fight them to the end, smash all their conspiracies and tricks, get rid of their exploitation and control, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, together with the people of the whole country, actively contribute more and greater strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and to the defense of world peace.

### 反帝斗争的又一重大胜利  李维光、胡文耀代表谈天主教界拥护对龚品梅叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的裁判

    反帝斗争的又一重大胜利
    李维光、胡文耀代表谈天主教界拥护对龚品梅叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的裁判主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    通过报告和讨论，以及在江苏省的视察参观，使我们深刻地认识到，当前我们国家的政治、经济、科学文化等各方面的形势是极为良好的。1960年国民经济计划仍是一个全面的更好的继续大跃进的计划。现在席卷全国的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约群众运动，在总路线的光辉照耀下，正在蓬勃地开展着，各个战线上千百万职工和全体劳动人民的革命干劲和雄心大志振奋人心，第一季度“月月红”的生产捷报不断传来，这就为提前和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划创造了非常有利的条件，也给全国人民带来了美满幸福的前景。这一切都是中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导的伟大胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的伟大胜利。我们天主教人士深为这种处处呈现着光明，处处充满着希望的美好景象所鼓舞，同时也深为生活在这样一个伟大的时代而感到光荣和自豪。
    解放后，中国天主教界发起了反帝爱国运动，给帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略我国的各种阴谋活动以沉重的打击，最近上海中级法院对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的裁判，是中国人民反帝斗争、也是天主教界反帝爱国运动的又一重大胜利。因此，我们愿意就这个案件谈谈我们的看法和认识。
    最近上海中级人民法院先后对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱进行了公开审讯和判处。在审判大会上，我们亲眼看到龚品梅反革命叛国集团的大量的确凿罪证，亲耳听到以龚品梅为首的十四名叛国分子的亲口招供。招认了他们披着宗教外衣，一贯破坏国家各项政治运动和政策、法律、法令的实施，破坏全国各地天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，勾结、包庇帝国主义间谍，窃取国家机密情报，窝藏特务、反革命分子；鼓吹美帝国主义的侵略战争，破坏世界和平运动等罪证。老牌间谍分子华理柱主持“天主教中央局”，指挥隐藏在天主教内的帝国主义间谍和反革命分子，有组织、有计划地进行颠复我国人民民主政权的罪恶活动；华理柱更领导着“天主教中央局”属下的“华明通讯社”和“圣母军”等反动组织，搜集我国军事、政治、经济情报，疯狂地煽动天主教徒和神职人员，反对共产党和人民政府，企图达到美帝国主义侵略中国的目的。
    由于美国间谍华理柱和以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团的罪证如山，使我们进一步认识到利用天主教，作为侵略工具，是美帝国主义侵略我国的主要阴谋之一，而罗马教廷甘心作美帝国主义的帮凶，以宗教外衣作掩护，把国际间谍特务机构和罪大恶极的间谍分子和反革命分子布置在美帝国主义控制之下，替美帝侵略战争政策效劳。这些事实都很好地证明罗马教廷忠实地充当美帝国主义的走狗，阴谋把中国天主教变为美国侵略中国的工具。但是在中国共产党领导下的觉悟起来的中国天主教友和神职人员，通过这两个案件更清楚地认识了罗马教廷的反动本质和狰狞面目，它是中国人民的死敌，也是中国天主教友的死敌，我们必须与它划清敌我界限，彻底摆脱它的一切控制，肃清它的一切影响，坚决走独立自主自办教会的道路。
    由于美国间谍华理柱受到我国法律的制裁，揭露了美帝国主义的破坏阴谋，美国政府大为恼火，公开为华理柱的间谍活动进行辩护。美国国务卿赫脱发表所谓“声明”，并指使其代表在华沙举行的中美大使级会谈中恬不知耻地提出所谓“抗议”，企图掩盖华理柱的罪行，从而替指使华理柱从事间谍颠复活动的美帝国主义开脱罪责。真是做贼心虚，欲盖弥彰，不但不能开脱罪责，反而更加证实了华理柱在中国的犯罪活动正是美国政府一贯图谋颠复中国政府各种阴谋活动中的一个环节。诚如上面所说的间谍分子华理柱的这些罪恶活动，那一点是“宗教性”的，那一点与宗教有什么共同之点呢？至于说什么对教友“灵魂福利”的“献身精神”，那更是胡说八道，不值一驳。这个老牌的间谍分子华理柱，他所披的只是一身宗教外衣，他所做的却是美帝国主义指使的在宗教外衣掩护下的间谍罪恶活动，除此而外，并无其他。我上海人民法庭对这样一个罪大恶极的间谍分子判处徒刑，全国天主教人士莫不拍手称快，美国政府却把这事硬与宗教联在一起，并恶毒地诬蔑我国政府“继续迫害宗教”，真是荒谬已极。大家知道，在我们国家里，是完全有宗教信仰自由的，正当的宗教活动一贯受到宪法受到国家的保护。但像华理柱一类的间谍分子，不管他披着什么外衣，在我国是没有自由的，并要受到我国法律的制裁的。十年来令人信服的事实完全说明了这一点。美国政府妄图以种种卑鄙手段抵赖华理柱的罪行，那是赖不掉的；梦想利用宗教信仰问题来欺骗世界人民，也是欺骗不了的。中华人民共和国的法律尊严和一切司法权利，决不容美帝国主义者干涉，已经觉醒了的中国天主教友也决不再受美帝国主义和罗马教廷的利用和欺骗。
    现在美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，并在国际紧张局势日趋缓和的情况下，玩弄表面和平实际备战的两面手法。与此同时，它还继续与罗马教廷狼狈为奸，继续利用天主教进行敌视我国的阴谋破坏活动。因此我们中国天主教神职人员和教友必须提高警惕，站稳立场，努力自我改造，继续深入开展反帝爱国运动，任凭美帝国主义和罗马教廷耍什么花招，我们坚决与它们斗争到底，粉碎它们的一切阴谋诡计，摆脱它们的利用和控制，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，和全国人民一道，为祖国的社会主义建设事业，为保卫世界和平，积极贡献更多更大的力量。
