Xinhua News Agency, London - The British Guiana Constitutional Conference, which began on March 7, broke down on the 29th after seventeen sessions.

Before leaving London, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, head of the Guiana delegation and chairman of the Guiana People's Progressive Party, condemned Britain for not allowing British Guiana independence at a press conference. He said that British Colonial Secretary Macleod made it clear almost from the beginning of the meeting that he was not prepared to allow Guiana independence. Moreover, he was not even prepared to propose internal self-government.

Jagan pointed out that although the British government accepted the words "the principle of independence" in the final plan of the conference, it put forward many conditions that would virtually exclude independence indefinitely. He went on to say: "All the people of the colonies must remember this lesson, that freedom cannot be achieved by entreaties and peaceful protests alone, but that direct action must be taken. Furthermore, the people of the colonies must learn to unite and realize that only united action can achieve freedom."

    英属圭亚那人民决心争取独立
    贾根博士谴责英国的殖民主义态度
    据新华社伦敦电　从3月7日开始的英属圭亚那制宪会议，经过十七次会议后，已于29日宣告破裂。
    圭亚那代表团团长、圭亚那人民进步党主席契迪·贾根博士在离开伦敦前举行的记者招待会上谴责英国不让英属圭亚那独立。他说，英国殖民地大臣麦克劳德几乎在会议一开始就表明，他不准备让圭亚那独立。而且，他甚至不准备提出内政自治。
    贾根指出，英国政府在会议的最后方案里虽然接受了“独立的原则”的字眼，但是提出实际是无限期地排除独立的许多条件。他接着说：“殖民地所有人民必须记住这个教训，光靠恳求和和平抗议是不能取得自由的，必须采取直接行动。此外，殖民地人民必须学会联合起来，并且认识到只有联合行动才能获得自由。”
