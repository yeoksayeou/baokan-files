Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will resolutely implement them.
    The public canteens in the Luxi People's Commune of Pingxiang County were established in August 1958, when the people's communes were formed. The commune has a total population of 40,000, with over 7,000 households. At that time, 388 public canteens were set up one after another. Each canteen served an average of about 100 people; the largest served 160 people, and the smallest served more than 40. Thanks to the strong leadership of the Party and the support and endorsement of the broad masses, not a single canteen has disbanded since its establishment. On the contrary, they are getting better and better and becoming more and more consolidated. The advantages of public canteens have now taken root in the hearts of the people and are warmly praised by the broad masses of commune members: "Public canteens have many benefits, men, women, old and young are all smiles, we eat well with dry and wet foods, the food is hot and the dishes are fragrant and varied, life is happy and morale is high, promoting the great leap forward in production." We have the following main experiences in running public canteens well.
    First, strengthening the Party's leadership and adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for running public canteens well. The commune Party committee attaches great importance to the work of the canteens. It designated the deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, the deputy secretary of the brigade Party branch, and the deputy captain of the production team to be specifically responsible for managing this work. The commune Party committee and brigade Party branch regularly supervise and inspect, and promptly study, discuss, and resolve the specific problems existing in the public canteens. Party members, Youth League members, activists, and selfless commune members are selected to participate in the canteen management work. All cadres of the commune take the lead, without exception, in participating in the public canteens, eating and working with the masses, and becoming one with the commune members. The commune Party committee also stipulates that production brigades and production teams hold life and welfare committee meetings once a month and every half month respectively to specifically study, discuss, and arrange the work of the canteens. The work of the canteens is summarized at any time, on-site meetings are held, advanced experiences are exchanged, red banner competitions are carried out, and models are established at both ends to lead the middle, so as to continuously promote and improve the work of public canteens.
    Second, implement democratic management, implement the mass line, and establish and improve necessary systems. Ensure that everyone understands the canteen's financial situation, forming a situation where everyone manages the canteen, everyone loves the canteen, and everyone cares about the canteen. Each canteen is managed by a canteen management committee composed of five to seven people elected by all the commune members participating in the canteen, who are politically reliable, selfless, and enthusiastic about running the canteen. They are responsible for propaganda and education, financial revenue and expenditure, physical object storage, vegetables, poultry and livestock production, grain, and sanitation. Establish a system for regularly publishing accounts, implementing daily clearing and monthly settlements, and publishing them to the masses every month; cash receipts and payments are documented, and physical object receipts and payments have acceptance procedures. Major issues and expenditure plans of the canteen must be discussed and agreed upon by the masses before they can be implemented. The monthly income and expenditure of the canteen are reported to the brigade and commune for review. This thoroughly changed the phenomenon of "no one cares whether the food is good or bad, and no one keeps track of how much is eaten" that existed at the beginning.
    Third, improve the grain management system, implement planned grain consumption, and conserve grain. In the early days of the canteen's establishment, there was some confusion in terms of grain consumption, resulting in some waste and exceeding the grain consumption quota. In response to this situation, we adopted a system of "quantifying grain according to the number of people, issuing tickets according to the quantity, using rice according to tickets, and returning savings to oneself." Determine the amount of grain used per person per year and the amount of grain consumed per household per month. Commune members plan their own grain consumption according to the quantitative standards. The canteen prints meal tickets according to the monthly quantitative figures for each household and distributes them to the commune members on a monthly basis. Commune members eat based on the tickets. At the end of the month, the canteen settles accounts once. The grain saved by the commune members belongs to themselves. The remaining meal tickets can be exchanged for cash at the canteen, or they can be kept for use in the next month, or they can be exchanged for grain. Those who are short can adjust among commune members. After implementing this method, the Red Flag Canteen alone saved 314 kilograms of grain in one month. This grain can feed all the people in the canteen for two days. This gradually cultivates the habit of careful calculation and grain saving among commune members and the habit of diligence and thrift.
    Fourth, establish vegetable, livestock, and poultry production bases to ensure the supply of non-staple food for public canteens. In order to ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and run the canteens well, it is necessary to develop and establish production bases for non-staple foods. Therefore, our commune has allocated more than 1,200 mu of land as vegetable bases. This produces a large number of vegetables throughout the year, and commune members can eat an average of one and a half to two kilograms of vegetables per person per day. Not only is it self-sufficient, but there is also a surplus. Last year alone, more than 1.7 million kilograms of vegetables were taken out to supply the cities and industrial and mining areas of Pingxiang. Each canteen has established a pig farm. Last year, a total of 17,000 pigs were raised; each person ate an average of 15 kilograms of meat per year; in addition, more than 1,500 heads were sold to the state. Each canteen raised a large number of poultry. The entire commune has more than 176,000 chickens, ducks, geese, and other poultry. In addition, there are more than 300 large and small fish ponds with an area of more than 2,000 mu, raising more than 1.7 million fish, with a fish production of 2,150 dan. The establishment of vegetable, livestock, and poultry bases has played an important role in improving the lives of commune members, consolidating and developing canteens, and supplying non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas.
    Fifth, in order to run public canteens well, we have resolutely implemented the policy of actively running well and participating voluntarily. In the early days of the canteen's opening, the vast majority of commune members supported it. However, a few people held a wait-and-see attitude and thought they would try it out. Although they joined the canteen, they thought that if it was good, they would continue to participate, and if it was not good, they would withdraw. A few people did not believe that the canteen could be run well at all, and they did not want to join the canteen. We did not take simple coercive methods against these people. We clearly realize that only by actively running the canteen well and making them see the superiority of the public canteen with their own eyes can we promote their conscious and voluntary participation. For this reason, we have always taken a positive attitude towards running the canteen well, trying our best to overcome all difficulties, and resolutely running the canteen well. According to the characteristics of the commune members, we give reasonable arrangements and possible care to the elderly, young, sick, disabled, pregnant women, and women in childbirth. It has now been done so that each meal has dry and wet food, dishes have meat and vegetables, there are dishes and soup, and the meals are diversified; during the busy farming season, those who participate in the main labor receive three dry meals, two dishes, and one soup, eating their fill and eating well; during the slack farming season, there are two dry meals and one porridge, eating coarse grains and eating their fill; for the elderly and children, there are three meals a day, with dry and wet food, eating their fill and eating well; pregnant women, women in childbirth, and infants are given flour, meat, fish, eggs, and other nutritional foods; for the sick, the canteen can make some other meals and send them home to eat; for guests of commune members, they can eat at the canteen or take them home to eat, and the canteen can also make other dishes for the guests according to the requirements of the commune members. Because the canteen is getting better and better, people who were watching have also joined the canteen, and people who did not want to participate have also automatically requested to participate in the canteen. The broad masses of commune members are very satisfied. An old man in his sixties said: "The canteen is really good, the old people's hearts are not old, we can eat our fill with dry and wet food, and the care for the elderly is really good. We will live forever and become young again, thanks to the good leadership of the Party." Therefore, 100% of the households and 100% of the commune members have joined the canteen. Now the canteen has truly become "unbreakable."
    Sixth, carry out cooking utensil reform, save cooking staff, which is not only conducive to consolidating the canteen, but also conducive to developing production. "In the past, women suffered from hard work, turning to the stove all year round. Their heads and faces were smoked black, and their hands were worn out from carrying water and grinding rice. Since the Communist Party came, life has been as sweet as honey. The canteen tools have been greatly innovated, saving labor and engaging in production." The above few sentences can illustrate the urgent desire of women to be liberated from heavy housework and the importance of cooking utensil reform. Although the public canteen has been established, it still occupies a large number of female laborers in the cooking work of the canteen. Since 1959, our commune has mobilized the broad masses to carry out technical reforms of cooking utensils. All canteens in the commune have reformed and promoted more than a dozen kinds of cooking utensils such as vegetable cutting machines, washing machines for vegetables, bowls, and chopsticks, and rice washing machines. This has reduced the heavy cooking labor, improved work efficiency, and ensured the quality of meals. After the reform of cooking utensils, the number of people originally engaged in cooking work has been reduced from 1,448 to the current 796; from the original 13.9% of the total labor force to the current 7.6%. These liberated labor forces have powerfully supported the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    我们的公共食堂越办越好
    易瑞生代表谈萍乡芦溪人民公社办食堂的经验主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
      萍乡县芦溪人民公社的公共食堂，是在1958年8月人民公社化的时候办起来的。全社共有四万人，七千余户，当时相继办起来三百八十八个公共食堂，每个食堂平均就食的人有一百左右；大的达一百六十人，小的在四十人以上。由于党的坚强领导，得到广大群众的支持和拥护，所以从开办以来，没有一个散伙的，相反的越办越好，越来越巩固了。公共食堂的优越性，现在已经深入人心，受到广大社员的热烈赞扬：“公共食堂好处多，男女老少笑呵呵，有干有稀吃的好，饭热菜香花样多，生活愉快干劲足，促进生产大跃进。”我们对办好公共食堂，主要有以下几点体会。
    第一，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是办好公共食堂的根本保证。公社党委对于食堂工作，非常重视。指定公社党委副书记、大队总支副书记和生产队副队长，具体分工管理这项工作。公社党委、大队总支经常督促检查，及时研究、讨论和解决公共食堂所存在的具体问题。选拔党员、团员、积极分子和大公无私的社员，参加食堂管理工作。公社所有干部，以身作则，毫无例外的都参加公共食堂，和群众同吃同劳动，与社员打成一片，公社党委还规定生产大队、生产队分别每月和半个月开一次生活福利委员会议，专门研究讨论和布置食堂的工作。随时总结食堂的工作，召开现场会议，交流先进经验，开展红旗竞赛，抓两头带中间，树立标兵，以不断的推动和改进公共食堂的工作。
    第二，实行民主管理，贯彻群众路线，建立、健全必要的制度。做到人人了解食堂的家底，形成人人管理食堂，人人爱护食堂，人人关心食堂。每个食堂，都由参加食堂的全体社员，选出政治上可靠，大公无私，热心办食堂的人，由五到七人组成的食堂管理委员会，分工负责宣传教育、财务收支、实物保管、蔬菜、家禽家畜生产粮食和卫生等项工作。建立定期公布账目的制度，实行日清月结，月月向群众公布；收付现金，有账有据，收付实物，有验收手续，对食堂重大问题和开支计划，要经过群众的讨论和同意，然后才能执行，食堂每月收支情况，作出表报，交大队和公社进行审查。从而彻底的改变了开始那种“吃好吃坏无人管，吃多吃少无账看”的现象。
    第三，健全粮食管理制度，实行计划用粮，节约用粮，食堂成立初期，曾一度在用粮方面，有些混乱，造成一些浪费，超过用粮指标，针对这一情况，我们采取了“以人定量，按量发票，凭票用饭，节约归己”的制度。确定每年每人用粮数量和每户每月吃粮指标。社员根据定量的标准，自己计划用粮。食堂根据每户每月定量数字，印制饭票，按月发给社员，社员凭票吃饭，到月底食堂结算一次，社员节约的粮食归己。剩余的饭票，可向食堂换取现钱，或者留下月使用，也可以换粮食。不足的人，在社员之间，可以互相调剂。实行这个办法以后，仅红旗食堂，一个月就节约粮食三百一十四斤，这些粮食，可以供该食堂所有的人吃两天。这样就逐渐的养成社员精打细算，节约粮食的习惯和勤俭过日子的风气。
    第四，建立蔬菜、家畜家禽生产基地，保证公共食堂副食品的供应。为了使社员吃饱、吃好和办好食堂，必须发展和建立副食品的生产基地。因此我们公社划出一千二百余亩地作为蔬菜基地。这样一年四季生产大量的蔬菜，社员每人每天平均可吃到蔬菜一斤半到两斤。不仅自食而且有余。去年一年，拿出一百七十多万斤蔬菜，供应给萍乡城市和工矿。每个食堂，都建立养猪场。去年共养猪一万七千头；每人一年平均吃肉十五斤；此外还卖给国家一千五百多头。每个食堂，都养了大量的家禽，全社共有鸡鸭鹅等家禽十七万六千多只，另外，又建有大小鱼塘三百多个，面积达二千多亩，养鱼一百七十余万尾，鱼的产量达二千一百五十担。由于建立了蔬菜和家畜家禽基地，对于改善社员的生活，巩固和发展食堂以及供应城市、工矿的副食品，都起了重要的作用。
    第五，为了办好公共食堂，我们坚决的贯彻了积极办好，自愿参加的方针。在食堂开办初期，绝大部分社员是拥护和支持的。但是有少数人，抱着观望和试试看的态度，虽然加入了食堂，心里却有好就继续参加，不好就退出的想法，个别的人，根本不相信食堂能办的好，他们不想加入食堂。对这些人我们并没有采取简单的强制的方法。我们明确的认识到，只有积极的办好食堂，使他们亲眼看到公共食堂的优越性，才能促使他们自觉自愿的参加。为此，我们从来对待办好食堂，就采取积极的态度，想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，坚决的要把食堂办好。我们根据社员的特点，在可能的条件下，对老、幼、病、残、孕产妇等，都给予合理安排和可能的照顾。现在已经作到，每餐饭有干稀、菜有荤素、有菜有汤、饭菜多样化；在农忙时对参加主要劳动的人，是三干二菜一汤，吃饱吃好；在农闲时，是二干一稀，吃粗吃饱；对老人，小孩，是一日三餐，有干有稀，吃饱吃好，对孕、产妇和婴儿，分别发给面粉、肉、鱼和蛋等营养食品；对待生病的人，食堂可以给另做一些饭菜，送到家里去吃；对社员来的客人，可到食堂就食，也可以打回家去吃，食堂还可以根据社员的要求，给客人另外做菜。由于食堂越办越好，所以观望的人，也参加了食堂，不想参加的人，也自动的要求参加食堂了。广大社员，都非常满意。有位六十多岁的老人说：“食堂真正好，人老心不老，有干有稀吃得饱，照顾老年真正好，长生不老转少年，感谢党的好领导。”所以百分之百户、百分之百社员，都加入了食堂。现在食堂真正成了“雷打不散”的了。
    第六，开展炊具改革，节约炊事人员，既有利于巩固食堂，也有利于发展生产。“从前妇女受熬煎，长年累月转灶边，头与面黑烟熏眼，提水碾米手磨穿，自从来了共产党，日子过得蜜样甜，食堂工具大革新，节省劳力搞生产。”以上几句话，可以说明妇女要求从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来的迫切愿望和炊事工具改革的重要意义。公共食堂虽然成立了，但是在食堂的炊事工作上，仍然占用着大批的妇女劳动力。1959年以来，我们公社，发动了广大群众，进行了炊事工具的技术改革，公社的所有食堂，改革了和推广了切菜机、洗菜、碗、筷和淘米机等十几种的炊事工具。减轻了繁重的炊事劳动，提高了工作效率，并保证了饭菜的质量。在炊事工具改革后，由原担任炊事工作的一千四百四十八人，减少到现在的七百九十六人；由原来占总劳动力的13.9％，而降为现在的7.6％。解放出来的这些劳动力，有力的支援了农业生产大跃进。
