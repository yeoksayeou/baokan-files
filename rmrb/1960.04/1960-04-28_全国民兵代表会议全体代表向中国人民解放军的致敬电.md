To all commanders and fighters of the beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades and comrades-in-arms:

We are the militia representatives from all fronts across the country, and we feel extremely honored to be able to attend this National Militia Representative Conference in the capital of the motherland. On the occasion of the successful closing of this conference, we would like to extend our highest revolutionary salute to our close comrades-in-arms, the People's Liberation Army!

Dear Comrades! You are a heroic force led by the Party and Chairman Mao, the outstanding sons and daughters of the 650 million people, the defenders of socialism, and also the builders of socialism. In the long revolutionary struggle of the past, you have steadfastly followed the direction indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relied closely on the people of the whole country, flexibly implemented Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking, bravely and tenaciously defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad, achieved the great victory of the revolutionary war, and established the People's Republic of China. In the ten years since the founding of the country, you have not only been a heroic fighting force, but also an excellent working team, and have made brilliant achievements in defending and building the motherland. In more than thirty years of struggle, you have accumulated rich combat experience and developed a fine style of being brave, tenacious, hardworking, united, alert, earnest, and lively. Wherever the Party points, you rush there. This noble quality and fine style of loyalty to the Party and the cause of the people will always be an example for us to learn from.

Dear Comrades! Since the founding of the country, especially since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao proposed the establishment of large-scale militia divisions, China's militia organizations have achieved great development. Now, all of us militiamen, together with the people of the whole country, are marching towards nature and towards cultural science and technology, contributing our strength on all fronts of socialist construction. However, we have not forgotten for a moment that US imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, frantically expanding its arms and preparing for war, developing missiles and missile bases, and actively supporting Japanese and West German militarism, seriously threatening world peace and our country's security. We will never invade anyone, but we will never allow anyone to invade us. In order to safeguard peace and the socialist cause, we are actively learning the skills to defend our motherland, and are always ready, if imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, we hundreds of millions of militiamen will fully cooperate with and support you. However many people you need, we will have that many; wherever you fight, we will support you there, and completely defeat the invaders.

Dear Comrades! We militiamen are always your close comrades-in-arms and your reliable brothers. Not only do we actively join the army and participate in the war in wartime, but also in peacetime, we guarantee to send the best young militiamen to the troops. We will welcome comrades who are demobilized and discharged from the army every year with full enthusiasm, and jointly strengthen militia construction and build socialism together.

Dear Comrades! Let us hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and, in our different posts, strive valiantly to accelerate socialist construction and constantly strengthen our national defense forces! And extend
Revolutionary Salute
All Delegates of the National Militia Representative Conference

    全国民兵代表会议全体代表向中国人民解放军的致敬电亲爱的中国人民解放军全体指战员同志们，战友们：
    我们是来自全国各个战线的民兵代表，能在祖国的首都出席这次全国民兵代表会议，感到万分荣幸。趁此大会胜利闭幕之际，特向亲密的战友——人民解放军老大哥致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    亲爱的战友们！你们是党和毛主席领导下的英雄部队，是六亿五千万人民的优秀儿女，是社会主义的保卫者，又是社会主义的建设者。在过去长期的革命斗争中，你们坚定地遵循着党中央和毛主席指示的方向，紧紧依靠全国人民，灵活地执行了毛主席的战略战术，英勇顽强地打败了国内外强大的敌人，取得了革命战争的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。建国十年以来，你们不但是一支英勇的战斗队，而且是一支出色的工作队，在保卫祖国和建设祖国方面，都作出了辉煌的成绩。你们在三十多年的斗争中，积累了丰富的作战经验，养成了英勇顽强、艰苦奋斗和团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的优良作风。党指向那里，你们就奔向那里。这种忠于党、忠于人民事业的高贵品质和优良作风，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    亲爱的战友们！建国以来，特别是党中央和毛主席提出大办民兵师以来，我国的民兵组织获得了巨大发展。现在，我们全体民兵，正和全国人民一道，向大自然进军，向文化科学技术进军，在社会主义建设的各个战线上贡献我们的力量。但是，我们一刻也没有忘记：美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国的领土台湾，疯狂地扩军备战，发展导弹和导弹基地，并积极扶植日本和西德军国主义，严重地威胁世界和平和我国安全。我们决不会侵犯任何人，但是也决不容许任何人侵犯我们。为了维护和平，为了保卫社会主义事业，我们正积极学习保卫祖国的本领，时刻准备着，如果帝国主义胆敢对我国发动侵略战争，我们亿万民兵就全力配合和支援你们，你们要多少人，我们就有多少人；你们打到那里，我们就支援到那里，彻底打败侵略者。
    亲爱的战友们！我们民兵始终是你们的亲密战友，是你们可靠的兄弟。我们不但在战时积极参军参战，而且在平时，也保证输送最好的青年民兵到部队中去。对部队每年复员退伍的同志，我们将以满腔热情欢迎他们回来，共同加强民兵建设，共同建设社会主义。
    亲爱的战友们！让我们高高举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，在不同的岗位上，为加速社会主义建设和不断地增强国防力量，共同奋勇前进！　并致
    革命敬礼
                                  全国民兵代表会议全体代表
                                              1960年4月27日
