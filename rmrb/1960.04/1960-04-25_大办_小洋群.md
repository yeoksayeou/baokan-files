    Vigorously Develop "Small Foreign Groups"
    The experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years has proven that vigorously developing "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" is the most powerful weapon for strengthening the weak links in the national economy. Because "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" can mobilize the masses most widely, utilize resources most extensively, and implement the principle of self-reliance to the greatest extent, without relying on foreign aid; their investment is small and construction is easy. Therefore, they can develop rapidly and in large quantities. For strengthening weak links, vigorously developing "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" is also a way to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Due to the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the acceleration of agricultural technical transformation, new contradictions have emerged in the national economy. That is, the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels cannot keep up with demand. How to solve this contradiction? In addition to shifting the main focus of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to this aspect, another important method is to vigorously develop "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" to achieve high-speed and substantial increases in production.
    At present, the vigorous development of "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" should focus on small coal mines, small blast furnaces, and small railways. Because the most urgent and largest demands of current production and construction, technical revolution, and agricultural technical transformation are for steel. To increase steel production, you must first have iron; to have iron, you must first have coal; and to have coal, you must have corresponding transportation conditions. Therefore, all localities must first grasp these three main links, accelerate the technical transformation of existing small coal mines and small blast furnaces, quickly resume production of those that have been suspended, and, in particular, immediately start organizing large-scale new construction.
    Focusing on small coal mines, small blast furnaces, and small railways does not mean that other industries are not important. Small converters, small rolling mills, small chemical plants, small oil refineries, small machinery factories, small power stations, small non-ferrous metal mines and smelters, and small agricultural and sideline product processing plants all need to be greatly developed. This is not only because these products are mostly important raw materials that are currently in great demand, but also because the "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" of all trades and industries are interdependent. We must grasp both the key points and the general in order to ensure comprehensive development and a comprehensive leap forward.
    Vigorously developing "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" is not just a matter for special districts, counties, and rural people's communes. Urban people's communes must also vigorously develop "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups." Even large enterprises must, according to their own needs, utilize their by-products and "waste materials" to vigorously develop "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups." If everyone makes a concentrated effort to attack the weak links, the weak links will be rapidly strengthened, and production and construction, technical revolution, and agricultural technical transformation will receive timely and strong support, accelerating the pace of advancement.
    Jiangxi, Anhui, and many other places have already taken action, and a new upsurge in vigorously developing "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" is about to begin. Let us seize the opportunity to promote this nationwide movement and promote this new upsurge!

### 大办“小洋群”

    大办“小洋群”
    两年来大跃进的经验证明，大办“小洋群”和“小土群”，是加强国民经济中薄弱环节的最有力的武器。因为“小洋群”和“小土群”能够最广泛地动员群众，最广泛地利用资源，最大限度地实行自力更生的原则，不依赖外援；它的投资少、建设容易。因此，它能以最快的速度大量地发展起来。对加强薄弱环节来说，大办“小洋群”和“小土群”也是一条多快好省的路。
    由于技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，由于农业技术改造的加速进行，现在国民经济中出现了新的矛盾。这就是原料、材料和燃料的生产赶不上需要。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？除了把技术革新和技术革命运动的主攻方向转到这方面来，另一个重要方法就是大办“小洋群”和“小土群”，实现高速度的大幅度的增产。
    目前，大办“小洋群”和“小土群”，要以小煤矿、小高炉和小铁路为中心。因为当前的生产建设、技术革命和农业技术改造的最迫切、最大量的要求是钢材。而要增产钢材，首先要有钢，要钢先要有铁，要铁必须有煤，要煤又必须有相应的运输条件。因此，各个地方要首先抓住这三个主要环节，对现有的小煤矿、小高炉要加速技术改造，停顿了的要迅速恢复生产，特别是要立即着手组织大规模的新建。
    以小煤矿、小高炉、小铁路为中心，并不是说别的行业就不重要了。小转炉、小轧钢厂、小化工厂、小石油厂、小机械厂、小电站、小的有色金属矿山和冶炼厂，小的农副产品加工厂，样样都要大发展。这不仅仅因为这些产品大都是当前大量需要的、重要的原材料，而且因为各行各业的“小洋群”、“小土群”是互相依存的，必须既抓重点，又抓一般，才能保证全面发展，全面跃进。
    大办“小洋群”和“小土群”，不仅仅是专区、县和农村人民公社的事。城市人民公社也要大办“小洋群”和“小土群”。就是大企业，也要根据自己的需要，利用自己的副产品和“废料”，大办“小洋群”和“小土群”。大家都来突击薄弱环节，薄弱环节就会迅速加强，生产建设、技术革命和农业技术改造就会得到及时的有力的支援，加快前进的步伐。
    江西、安徽，还有其他很多地方都已经行动起来，大办“小洋群”和“小土群”的新高潮就要开始了。让我们抓紧时机，推动这个全民性的运动，促进这个新高潮！
