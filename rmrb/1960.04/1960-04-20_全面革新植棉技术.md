    Comprehensively Innovate Cotton Planting Technology

    Shaanxi Province has begun to comprehensively innovate cotton planting technology this year. This will profoundly change the face of cotton production in this province.

    Shaanxi's cotton planting technology innovation has been underway for several years, but this year is different from previous years in that it is a comprehensive innovation. The term "comprehensive" is mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, the entire cotton cultivation process, from sowing to harvesting, implements a series of technological innovations; second, for the aspects of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and tools in the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," comprehensive advanced production-increasing technical measures are adopted; third, comprehensive innovation is carried out as much as possible in each cultivation step and each major measure. For example, in the single word "seeds," comprehensive efforts are made to establish seed bases, improve the system for preserving, selecting, and treating seeds, and also to do a good job in the combination of improved varieties and the rational layout of improved variety cultivation; fourth, these technological innovations go beyond the circle of high-yield fields and are carried out in all cotton fields. All of this shows that the province's cotton planting work is becoming more and more detailed, and the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is being implemented more deeply and specifically. This is an important guarantee for realizing a great leap forward in cotton production this year.

    Nothing exists in isolation; everything is inextricably linked to the things around it. A change in one thing will inevitably affect other things. The reason why comprehensively innovating cotton planting technology is good is that people have made comprehensive observations and research on the entire process of cotton growth and the various factors that increase cotton production, and have made comprehensive arrangements according to the role of each factor in increasing production and their interactions. In this way, the positive effects of these factors can be maximized and comprehensively brought into play, to achieve the goal of greater production increases. For example, according to the new change that the irrigated area of cotton fields in Shaanxi Province has increased by more than 68% compared to last year, the province has guided the new irrigated areas to level the land and vigorously carry out garden-style field construction; to accumulate more and better fertilizer, so that fertilizer and water are closely coordinated; and to select improved varieties suitable for irrigated farmland, etc. By doing so, the positive effects of these factors can be comprehensively brought into play, and greater production increase potential can be realized.

    However, the practical production in each season and each stage is specific and complex. Therefore, after comprehensive technical innovation measures have been stipulated, they must be applied flexibly at different times and under different conditions. Party committees at all levels in Shaanxi Province have extensively mobilized the masses to learn from the advanced experience of the famous cotton planting expert Zhang Qiuxiang—"Look at the sky, look at the land, look at the crops"—and creatively apply various advanced technologies. This is an important issue that must be paid attention to in comprehensively innovating cotton planting technology.

    Through several years of production practice and scientific research, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward, a large number of advanced cotton planting experiences have emerged in various places, the content of the "Eight-Point Charter" has been further developed, and the experience in implementing the Eight-Point Charter has become increasingly rich. At the same time, our people's communes have become more consolidated and developed, and commune industry and commune scientific and cultural activities are flourishing. These are all favorable conditions for comprehensively innovating cotton planting technology.

    It is now the cotton sowing season, and the task of comprehensively innovating cotton planting technology has been placed before all people's communes in cotton-growing areas. As long as leadership is strengthened and earnest efforts are made, a good start can certainly be created for the comprehensive innovation of cotton planting technology.

### 全面革新植棉技术

    全面革新植棉技术
    陕西省从今年开始，全面地进行了植棉技术革新。这件事将使这个省的棉花生产面貌发生深刻的变化。
    陕西的植棉技术革新已经进行几年了，今年不同于往年的，就在于它是全面的革新。所谓全面，主要表现在这样几个方面：首先是整个棉花栽培过程，从播种到收获，实行一系列的技术革新；第二是对于农业“八字宪法”的土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工等方面，全面地采取先进的增产技术措施；第三是在每个栽培步骤上、每项大的措施上都尽量进行全面的革新，例如仅仅一个“种”字，就要全面地抓建立种子基地、健全良种保管、精选和种籽处理等制度，同时还做好良种的组合和良种栽培上的合理布局等等；第四是这些技术革新越出了丰产田的圈子，在全部棉田进行。这些都说明，这个省的植棉工作愈做愈细了，农业八字宪法更加深入具体地贯彻执行了。这是实现今年棉花生产大跃进的重要保证。
    任何一个事物都不是孤立的，都是和周围的事物有着千丝万缕的联系。一个事物发生了变化，必然会影响到另一些事物。全面地革新植棉技术所以好，就是因为人们对于棉花生长的全部过程和棉花增产的各种因素都作了全面的观察研究，并且按照各个因素在增产中的地位和它们之间的相互作用作出全面的安排，这样就能最大限度地、综合地发挥这些因素的积极作用，达到更多地增产的目的。例如，陕西省根据今年棉田灌溉面积比去年增加了68％以上这个新的变化，就指导新灌区进行平整土地、大搞园田化；积制更多更好的肥料，使肥、水密切配合；选择适于灌溉农田的良种等等。这样做，就能综合地发挥这些因素的积极作用，发挥更大的增产潜力。
    但是，每个季节、每个阶段的生产实践都是具体的，复杂的，因此，规定了全面的技术革新措施以后，还得在不同的时间和条件下加以灵活的运用。陕西省各级党委广泛发动群众学习著名植棉能手张秋香的先进经验——“看天、看地、看庄稼”，创造性地运用各种先进技术。这是全面革新植棉技术的一个必须注意的重要问题。
    经过几年来特别是大跃进的两年来的生产实践和科学研究，各地的先进植棉经验大量地涌现了，“八字宪法”的内容进一步发展了，贯彻执行八字宪法的经验越来越丰富了。同时，我们的人民公社也更加巩固和发展了，公社工业、公社的科学文化活动正在蓬勃发展着，这些都是全面革新植棉技术的有利条件。
    目前正是棉花播种季节，全面革新植棉技术的任务已经提到一切棉区人民公社的面前，只要加强领导，切实努力，一定能够给植棉技术的全面革新创造一个良好的开端。
