    争取释放格列索斯
    据新华社21日讯　塔斯社雅典讯：据“黎明日报”记者自科孚岛报道，律师们19日探望了绝食后在监狱病房治疗的格列索斯。格列索斯宣布绝食是为了抗议把他同刑事犯监禁在一起。据这家报纸报道，一批统一民主左翼党的议员会见了希腊司法大臣卡利亚斯，并要求把格列索斯转到政治犯监狱去。希腊公众决心继续斗争，直到完全释放格列索斯和其他民主人士为止。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社雅典20日讯：据“埃斯蒂亚报”报道，雅典军事法庭将在4月26日开始审讯五十名被控告进行“间谍活动”的希腊共产党员。以雅典警察局局长拉金吉斯为首的十三名警察局官员将以“原告证人”的身份出庭作证。这表明，这次审讯也是由政治警察局制造的。
