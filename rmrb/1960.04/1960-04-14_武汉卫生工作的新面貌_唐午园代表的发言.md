Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft, as well as Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I propose that the congress adopt them.

    Now, I would like to give a brief report to the congress on the situation of Wuhan's health work that I have learned about over the past year.

    General Progress: Under the correct leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, Wuhan's health work has earnestly implemented the principles of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, prioritizing prevention, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining health work with mass movements." On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has advanced victoriously in 1959, and in 1960 it has continued to leap forward with even greater strides, achieving brilliant successes like other fronts of work, including the fifteen counties in the Xiaogan area, with a population of 8.5 million, that were placed under the direct leadership of Wuhan City in 1959. The scope of health work has been further expanded, achieving a brilliant "red opening" in 1960, "red every month," and "red everywhere," with a bright and inspiring future.

    I. Over the past year, Wuhan's health work has taken ideology as the key link and the elimination of pests and diseases as the center, promoting an all-round leap forward in health work. Especially under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, after the rectification movement of anti-rightist and encouragement of vigor, and the education of the general line of socialism, it has developed by leaps and bounds. In the work of eliminating pests and diseases, methods of prioritizing prevention and active treatment, combining Chinese and Western medicine, emphasizing both redness and expertise, and launching mass movements were adopted. According to the law of disease development, opportunities were seized to organize large-scale campaigns, make concentrated efforts, and focus on routine work, which was both vigorous and down-to-earth. Therefore, in 1959, on the basis of only a few health red banner residents' committees in 1958, after fighting hard in August and September, thirty-two health red banner streets emerged at once, and mosquitoes and flies were basically eliminated in areas with a population of about 700,000. Since the Spring Festival this year, in conjunction with the urban support for rural manure accumulation movement and the urban development of non-staple food production and greening work, large-scale excavation and filling of sewage ponds has been carried out, focusing on fundamental solutions. In just a few days, 20 million dan of manure were accumulated and delivered, and large and medium-sized sewage ponds such as Shahu, Huangjin Lake, and Maopu Lake, which were seriously harmful, were treated. In rural areas, combined with the three treatments (water management, mountain management, and soil management), a large-scale snail eradication campaign was launched, with a snail eradication area of more than 740,000 mu, which was 114% of the snail eradication area in previous years. The city completed the general survey of eight diseases (schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, malaria, syphilis, goiter, tinea capitis, uterine prolapse) and three diseases (hypertension, cancer, tuberculosis). In the past, the incidence of malaria in Anlu County was very high, with 70% in the Ditang Management Area of the county. After vigorous prevention and treatment in 1959, the incidence rate dropped to 0.018 per 10,000, becoming a malaria-free county. The masses sang praises: "The Fu River is clear and clear, and now the root of spleen cold is broken. It is not that the Bodhisattva has shown kindness, but the Party's care and grace." With the improvement of sanitary conditions and the development of preventive work, the incidence of many epidemics, seasonal infectious diseases, and endemic diseases has been greatly reduced. The Dongxihu District in the suburbs of the city is a key area for snails and schistosomiasis. Due to the emphasis on preventive work, the infection rate of schistosomiasis has dropped from 12.7% to 6.3%. According to preliminary statistics from eight districts in the urban area, compared with the same period in 1958, the incidence of several major infectious diseases in 1959 decreased by 99.8% for measles, 73.2% for pertussis, 72.1% for influenza, and 33.8% for meningitis. Due to the attention to dust prevention, heat prevention, poison prevention, and the strengthening of the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases and common diseases in various factories, the incidence rate has also decreased significantly. Among the 203 factories with silica dust operations in the city, the silica dust concentration in 124 factories has been reduced to below the national standard, ensuring the health of employees and supporting production.

    II. In supporting industrial and agricultural production: When the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal Committee issued a great call to all citizens to support the countryside and industry to support agriculture, all medical workers were invigorated, and everyone strove to be the first, regarding support for the countryside as a glorious task. All comprehensive hospitals in the city have further technically linked with county hospitals, adopting methods such as bringing people in, sending people down, surgical demonstrations, mobile treatment, correspondence courses, and organizing lectures to train technical forces in various counties, and adopting methods such as purchasing, selling, and transferring on their behalf to enrich the medical equipment of various counties. In 1959, in the urban support for rural drought resistance, water conservancy construction, and pest elimination work, thousands of medical personnel were organized to go deep into the countryside, fields, and construction sites to help improve sanitary conditions and prevent and treat diseases for farmers. Recently, more than 300 people have been transferred to support spring plowing and pest elimination in rural areas, ensuring that where there is a labor army, there are white-coated warriors, and where there are illnesses and injuries, there is medicine.

    Before this conference, I only inspected the Jiuling Commune in the mountainous area of Tongcheng County, Chongyang City, which belongs to Wuhan City, and made a comparative visit to the Henggou Commune in Xianning County and the entire health situation in Chongyang County, which have done a good job in eliminating pests and diseases. Because they listened to the Party and used the working method of the mass line, they have now completely changed their past backwardness and are rapidly realizing the four modernizations of the countryside. With the development of production, the rural health care cause has also undergone fundamental changes. The originally lacking medical care and medicine Jiuling Commune has now developed a commune hospital, five branch hospitals, six health clinics, and forty-eight first-aid kits, basically forming a health care network, with institutions at all levels. The pest elimination work in the commune this year is relatively outstanding. They carried out large-scale cooperation, with more than 70 medical personnel organized by the nearby Maishi and Hedui Communes to work intensively for more than 20 days, achieving high speed and high work efficiency, with certain achievements.

    III. The principle of prioritizing prevention and combining it with mass movements has been earnestly implemented in Wuhan City over the years, with significant results. Taking municipal hospitals as the backbone, organizing health professional forces and mass health forces, a relatively complete medical prevention network has been formed, thereby achieving the goals of prioritizing prevention and timely treatment. For example, adopting the method of technical linkage between municipal hospitals and county hospitals, with the larger leading the smaller, expanding medical prevention, and solving difficult diseases has achieved good results. The Fourth Municipal Hospital assisted the People's Hospitals of Huangpi and Anlu counties through the above methods, assisting the county hospitals in treating critically ill patients locally. In assisting in performing 284 various surgeries, they helped solve 166 cases, with a cure rate of 99%, shortening the treatment course by half, reducing the trouble of rural patients transferring to urban areas for treatment, and alleviating the suffering of patients. Actively assist grassroots health units in establishing health stations, do a good job in technical guidance and training, and directly serve their own units and regions, which can greatly reduce the incidence of disease and improve attendance rates. For example, grassroots health workers Chen Yingxian, Jin Rongzhu, and other comrades mastered the properties of more than 70 kinds of drugs in more than a month with the help and guidance of the hospital, and the treatment of more than 150 patients has been very effective. In this way, patients with minor illnesses and injuries can receive early treatment and prevention without leaving their homes. Here, special attention should be paid to the role of the mass Red Cross health stations. Red Cross health stations have now been established throughout Wuhan City, undertaking pest elimination, epidemic reporting, medical prevention, health publicity, and the implementation of the cleaning and sanitation supervision system. Some areas have also established separate meals, chopsticks, towels, and health service systems, creating favorable conditions for carrying out mass health and epidemic prevention work. Last year, in the urban area of Wuhan, due to the combination of professional health forces and mass health organization forces, large-scale disease prevention and treatment was carried out, achieving fast speed and good quality results. For example, last year, about one million children were vaccinated against tuberculosis, diphtheria, and other diseases. By cultivating key points and gaining experience, and then using the points to lead the whole area. The Municipal Red Cross Hospital adopted the above method, first focusing on cultivating the health work of the residents' committees in one district. After gaining mature experience, it was promptly promoted. As a result, the entire district fought hard for several days and nights, and realized full health coverage in the entire district. The Municipal Children's Hospital, in cooperation with the epidemic prevention departments of various districts, took a series of preventive measures in the six residents' committees in its responsible area last year. Therefore, during the measles and diphtheria epidemic period in other areas last year, no cases of measles and diphtheria were found in this area.

    Many hospitals in the urban area, in addition to actively grasping the medical prevention work in the responsible areas, also went to factories in batches, widely implementing the "four sendings" (sending medicine to the door, sending health knowledge to the door, sending labor to the door, sending political work to the door), "four grasps" (grasping the situation, grasping the three-level plan, grasping the incidence rate, grasping the strength of the Red Cross), "five edges" (edge publicity, edge general survey, edge treatment, edge training, edge construction) and the methods of "jumping three jumps" and "breaking through three barriers" (the first jump out of the hospital door breaks through the support for production barrier, the second jump out of the treatment circle breaks through the prevention-oriented barrier, the third jump out of the conservative circle breaks through the technical barrier, etc.). Due to the strengthening of health prevention and health care work, going deep into workshops, fields, and families, providing on-site and timely treatment and prevention, the incidence rate has been greatly reduced. According to the survey of several factories, the incidence rate of Wuhan Xinhua Printing Factory in 1959 decreased by 37.6% compared with the same period in 1958, Changhong Knitting Factory decreased by 56%, and Laotongxing Sauce Garden decreased by 28%. Because it is convenient for the masses to seek medical treatment, it is very popular among workers and peasants, thereby closely connecting the Party with the masses.

    From the above situation and examples, it can be seen that the close combination of professional health forces and mass health forces to carry out health prevention and treatment work, and the implementation of the principle of prioritizing prevention, is very effective.

    IV. Achievements in health organization construction and uniting Chinese and Western medicine: Due to the implementation of the two-pronged approach of combining large, medium, and small, combining state-run and commune-run, combining formal and simple, and combining popularization and improvement, it is closely combined with serving production and construction. Especially with the soundness, consolidation, and development of the people's communes, the development of epidemic prevention and health organizations is also very rapid. There are now 466 medical and epidemic prevention institutions at all levels in the city, an increase of 28% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958; the number of beds has increased to 20,364 (including 7,414 simple beds), excluding family beds set up in residents, an increase of 48.4% compared with 1958; nearly 7,000 mass grassroots health organizations have been established; more than 350,000 Red Cross members have been developed, and more than 70,000 health workers have been trained. Basic health coverage has been achieved in the urban area. Various hospitals have implemented the area responsibility system, establishing a relatively complete medical prevention network; three-level medical institutions have been established in the countryside, including county, commune, and management area, and health clinics or non-separated health workers have been set up in production teams, initially forming a medical prevention network, strengthening health care for production and life, and greatly improving medical and health conditions.

    In technological innovation and scientific research work, with the development of the health cause, there are rapid changes. Since 1959, there have been more than 16,000 technological innovation projects and more than 3,000 scientific research papers, far exceeding any previous year. Many of them are new medical scientific achievements, such as the successful artificial kidney experiment on animals, kidney transplantation and low-temperature open-heart surgery, femoral vein transplantation to the femoral artery, and various ultra-micro rapid testing methods, all of which have advanced levels of medical science. At the same time, we have also actively inherited and carried forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. With the close cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine, Chinese and Western medicine are used in every department, and Western medicine is vigorously learning from Chinese medicine. There are indeed many new discoveries and developments in treatment. For example, acupuncture is used to treat deafness and muteness, and ear acupuncture nerve stimulation therapy is used to treat diseases. In addition to its high efficacy in treating pertussis and polio, traditional Chinese medicine also has unique effects on infectious hepatitis and other diseases, making the traditional Chinese medicine further shine in the fight against the elimination of diseases. When the vigorous movement of collecting folk prescriptions and offering treasures of Chinese medicine was launched in the early spring of last year, great achievements were made. According to incomplete statistics, more than 240,000 effective prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and single prescriptions, more than 1,000 books on traditional Chinese medicine, and more than 400 handwritten copies have been collected in the urban area alone, and they have been compiled into books and tested in key areas and counties in the city, further enriching the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and improving the curative effect.

    V. Relying on the leadership of the Party is the foundation for the development and victory of all undertakings: My understanding is that the main reason for achieving the above results is first and foremost due to the leadership of the Party, and the victory of the Party's general line. It once again refutes the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists who believe that "the Party cannot lead science," "laymen cannot lead experts," and "business should be in command, not politics." This is because the health departments at all levels in our province and city have strengthened the Party's leadership in health work, implemented political command, trusted the masses, followed the mass line, and combined with mass movements. At the same time, it is also the result of medical workers actively responding to the Party's call, emancipating their minds, breaking superstitions, building up their energy, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, working hard, and working skillfully. In the past year's health work, we have more deeply realized that firmly relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to political command, launching mass movements, and adopting high-speed methods in all work are the guarantee and prerequisite for achieving leap forward victories in various tasks. Under the leadership and education of the Party committees at all levels, the medical workers in Wuhan City have adhered to political command, earnestly implemented the policy of facing production and serving production, reversed the bourgeois ideological style of "doctors not knocking on doors" and "sitting in hospitals to practice medicine," separating from production and separating from the masses, and the non-proletarian viewpoint of not trusting the masses and fearing mass movements. Thus, they began to go deep into the countryside, streets, factories, and construction sites to practice medicine locally and carry out disease prevention and control work, which was welcomed by workers and peasants. At the same time, due to the contact with production practice, feeling the encouragement of the workers and peasants' enthusiasm and the influence of the working class's ideology, especially by studying Chairman Mao's works, the medical workers' political awareness and work enthusiasm have been greatly improved, and they have gained a double harvest of ideology and business. This is indeed a very good red and expert path that is beneficial to our intellectuals' transformation.

    According to the spirit of the Central Sixth Schistosomiasis Prevention Conference's three-year plan and two-year completion, we are aiming at this general requirement and purpose, striving to eliminate the "six pests" and "six diseases" in the city before this year's National Day, and consolidate the work in the coming winter and spring. Not only should we strengthen guidance and supervision in collective living organizations such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens to disinfect tableware, promote separate meals, chopsticks, and towels, dissuade spitting everywhere, and cultivate good habits of the masses in paying attention to hygiene and loving cleanliness, but also manage the fecal pipes and fecal inspection work thoroughly and comprehensively. At the same time, in conjunction with farmland water conservancy, soil improvement, and municipal construction, we should launch mass movements, grasp fundamental solutions, eliminate epidemic areas, eradicate lakes and ponds, rectify sewers, septic tanks, toilets, and other breeding places for the spread of diseases, and further carry out comprehensive fundamental solutions. It can be predicted that Wuhan's health work, under the correct leadership of the Party, adhering to political command, earnestly implementing the policy of prioritizing prevention, and using the methods of launching mass movements, inserting red flags on a large scale, and setting up many pacesetters, will surely be able to quickly change the health appearance of Wuhan City to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development and people's cultural life.

    武汉卫生工作的新面貌
    唐午园代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告以及谭震林副总理为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。并建议大会通过。
    现在我想就我一年来所了解的武汉市的卫生工作的情况，向大会作个简要汇报。
    一般进展情况：武汉市的卫生工作，在中共湖北省委、省人委及中共武汉市委、市人委的正确领导下，认真贯彻了“面向工农兵、预防为主，团结中西医、卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的原则，在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年乘胜前进，1960年又以更加巨大的步伐持续跃进，同其他战线工作一样，连同1959年划归武汉市直接领导的孝感地区十五个县人口达八百五十万，卫生工作面更扩大了，都取得了1960年开门红、月月红、满堂红的辉煌成就，前景一片光明，令人兴奋鼓舞。
    一、一年来，武汉市的卫生工作，以抓思想为纲，以除害灭病为中心，推动了卫生工作全面跃进。特别是在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，经过反右倾、鼓干劲的整风运动和社会主义总路线教育以后，更是突飞猛进地向前发展。在除害灭病工作上，采取了 以预防为主和积极治疗的办法；中西医相结合、红专并重和大搞群众运动的方法。根据病害发展规律，抓紧时机，组织大兵团作战，大搞突击，大抓经常，既是轰轰烈烈，又是踏踏实实。因此，1959年在1958年仅有几个卫生红旗居民委员会的基础上，经过大战八、九两月，一跃出现了三十二个卫生红旗街，在约七十万人口的地区，基本上消灭了蚊蝇。今年春节以来，结合城市支援农村积肥运动和城市发展副食品生产与绿化工作中，大挖和大填污水塘，大抓治本工程，在短短几天内，积肥送肥达两千万担，将危害严重的沙湖、黄金湖、毛铺湖等大中型污水塘进行了处理。在农村结合三治（治水、治山、治土）开展了大规模地消灭钉螺工作，灭螺面积达七十四万余亩，为历年灭螺面积114％。全市完成了八病（血吸虫、丝虫、钩虫、疟疾、梅毒、甲状腺肿、头癣、子宫脱出）和三病（高血压、癌肿、结核）的普查任务。安陆县过去疟疾发病率很高，该县棣棠管理区高达70％，经过1959年大力防治，患病率下降到万分之零点一十八，成为无疟县，群众歌颂说：“府河水，清又清，如今脾寒断了根，不是菩萨发善心，是党的关心和恩情”。随着卫生状况的改善和预防工作的开展，使很多流行病、季节性的传染病和地方病的发病率大大减低，市郊的东西湖区，是钉螺和血吸虫病的重点区域，由于抓紧了预防工作，血吸虫的感染率，已由12.7％下降到6.3％。据城区八个区的初步统计，几种主要传染病的发病率，1959年与1958年同期比较，麻疹下降99.8％，百日咳下降73.2％，流行性感冒下降72.1％，脑膜炎下降33.8％。各工厂由于注意了防尘、防暑、防毒和加强了防治职业病中毒和多发病的工作，发病率亦显著下降，全市二百零三个矽尘作业工厂中已有一百二十四个工厂矽尘浓度降低到国家标准以下，保障了职工身体健康，支援了生产。
    二、在支援工农业生产上：当中共湖北省委，武汉市委向全体市民提出城市支援农村，工业支援农业的伟大号召后，全体医务工作人员人人振奋，个个争先，都以支援农村为光荣任务，全市各综合医院，均已分别与各县医院作了进一步的技术挂钩，采取接进来、派下去、手术示范、巡回治疗、举办函授、组织讲座等方式，培养各县技术力量，和采取代购、代销、调剂等办法充实各县医疗设备。1959年城市支援农村抗旱、水利建设和除害灭病工作中，组织了数以千计的医务人员，深入农村、田间、工地，协助改善卫生条件，为农民防治疾病。最近又抽调三百余人支援农村春耕和除害灭病工作，做到了那里有劳动大军，那里就有白衣战士，那里有病有伤，那里就有医有药。
    我在这次大会前，仅就武汉市属的崇阳县通城山区的九岭公社作了视察，并特对除害灭病作得较好的咸宁县的横沟公社和崇阳县的整个卫生情况作了对比的访问。由于他们听党的话，运用了群众路线的工作方法，现在已经彻底地改变了过去的落后面貌，正在迅速的实现农村四化。随着生产的发展，农村卫生保健事业也发生了根本变化，原来缺医少药的九岭公社，现在已发展起公社卫生院一所、分院五所、保健室六所、保健箱四十八个，基本上形成了一个卫生保健网，作到了层层有机构。该社今年的除害灭病工作比较突出，他们搞大协作，由附近的麦市、河堆公社组织了七十多名医务人员，突击二十余天，大闹高速度、高工效，都有一定的成就。
    三、以预防为主和群众运动相结合的方针，历年在武汉市已得到了认真贯彻，收效显著。采取了以市级医院为骨干，组织各方面卫生专业力量和群众卫生力量，形成了比较完整的医疗预防网，从而达到了预防为主，及时治疗。如采取市级医院与各县医院技术挂钩，以大带小的办法，扩大医疗预防，解决疑难病症，收效很好。市四医院与黄陂、安陆两县人民医院通过以上办法，协助县医院就地治疗危急病人，在施行各种手术二百八十四例中，协助解决了一百六十六例，治愈率达到99％，疗程缩短一倍，减少农村转城市治疗的麻烦，减轻了病人的痛苦。积极协助基层卫生单位建立保健站，作好技术指导和培养，直接为本单位和本地区服务，可以大大减少发病率，提高出勤率。如基层卫生保健员陈英贤、金荣珠等同志在医院帮助和指导下，一个多月掌握了七十多种药品性能，治疗的一百五十余例患者，疗效很好。这样就可以使小病小伤患者不出门，得到及早治疗和预防。这里应当特别注意群众性的红十字会保健站的作用，现在武汉市已普遍建立了红十字会保健站，担任除害灭病，疫情报告，医疗预防，卫生宣传和监督清扫保洁制度的贯彻。有些地区还建立了分食、分筷、分巾和卫生服务制度，为开展群众性的卫生防疫工作，创造了有利条件。去年在武汉市区，由于专业卫生力量与群众卫生组织力量结合起来，大搞疾病的预防和治疗，收到速度快、质量好的效果。例如去年一年就进行了约百万儿童的结核、白喉等预防接种工作。通过培养重点，取得经验，然后以点带面。市红十字会医院采取以上办法，首先重点培养了一个区的居民委员会的保健工作，在取得成熟经验以后，并及时加以推广，结果全区苦战了几昼夜，就实现了全区保健化。市儿童医院在各区防疫部门的配合下，去年在其责任地段六个居民委员会中，由于采取了一系列的预防措施，因而在去年别的地段麻疹、白喉流行期中，本地段没有发现一例麻疹和白喉病人。
    城区内许多医院，在其责任地段内，除积极抓紧了地段责任区的医疗预防工作以外，并分批下工厂，广泛地实行了四送（医药送上门，卫生知识送上门，劳动送上门，政治工作送上门）、四抓（抓情况，抓三级规划，抓发病率，抓红十字会的力量）、五边（边宣传，边普查，边治疗，边训练，边建设）和跳三跳、破三关（一跳出医院门突破支援生产关，二跳出治疗圈突破预防为主关，三跳出保守圈突破技术关等办法）。由于加强了卫生预防和保健工作，深入车间、田间、家庭，就地及时治疗和预防，大大地减少了发病率。据几个工厂的调查，武汉新华印刷厂1959年的发病率，比1958年同期下降37.6％，长虹针织厂下降56％，老同兴酱园下降28％。因为方便群众就医，很受工人、农民欢迎，从而密切了党与群众的关系。
    从以上情况和事例可以看出，卫生专业力量与群众卫生力量紧密结合起来进行卫生防治工作，贯彻预防为主的方针，收效是很好的。
    四、在卫生组织建设上和团结中西医的成就：由于贯彻了大中小相结合、国家举办与公社举办相结合、正规与简易相结合、普及与提高相结合等两条腿走路的方针，紧密地结合了为生产建设服务。特别是随着人民公社的健全巩固和发展，防疫保健组织的发展，也是很迅速的，全市已有各级医疗防疫机构四百六十六个，比大跃进的1958年还增长了28％；病床已发展到二万零三百六十四张（其中有简易病床七千四百一十四张）不包括在居民中设置的家庭病床，较1958年增长48.4％；群众性的基层保健组织，建立近七千个；发展红十字会会员三十五万余人，培训保健员七万余人，在城区已基本上实现保健化。各医院都推行了地段负责制，树立了一个比较完整的医疗预防网；在农村建立了县、公社、管理区三级医疗机构，在生产队设有保健室或不脱产的卫生员，已初步形成医疗预防网，加强了对生产和生活的卫生保健工作，大大地改善了医疗卫生条件。
    我们在技术革新和科学研究工作上，随着卫生事业的发展，日新月异。1959年以来，技术革新项目有一万六千余项，科学研究论文三千余篇，大大地超过以往任何一年。其中有很多是属于新的医学科学成就，如人工肾在动物身上试验成功，和进行肾移植与低温心脏直视手术，股静脉移植到股动脉，及多种超微量的快速化验方法等，都具有医学科学先进水平。与此同时，也积极地继承和发扬了祖国医学遗产，在中西医密切配合下，已在每科都有中西医并用，并蓬蓬勃勃地开展了西医学习中医，在治疗上确有不少新的发现和发展。如用针灸治疗聋哑，运用耳针神经刺激疗法治病。中医中药除对百日咳、小儿麻痹症有很高的疗效外，对于传染性肝炎等病亦有奇特功效，使祖国医学进一步在消灭疾病斗争中大放光彩。当去年春初轰轰烈烈地开展了中医药采风献宝运动，取得很大成绩。据不完全统计，仅在城区就收集了二十四万多验方、秘方、单方，一千多册中医药书籍，四百多手抄本，并已整理成册，在市内各区、县重点试用，更加丰富了祖国医学遗产，提高了疗效。
    五、依靠党的领导是一切事业发展胜利的基础：我的认识取得上述成绩的主要原因，首先归功于党的领导，是党的总路线的胜利，再一次驳斥了右倾机会主义分子认为“党不能领导科学”、“外行不能领导内行”、“要业务挂帅不要政治挂帅”等谬论。这是由于我省市各级卫生部门在卫生工作中加强了党的领导，贯彻了政治挂帅，相信群众，走群众路线，与群众运动相结合的结果。同时也是医务人员积极响应党的号召，解放思想，破除迷信，鼓足干劲，敢想敢说敢干与苦干实干巧干的结果。在过去一年的卫生工作中，使我们更加深刻地体会到坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动和在一切工作中采取高速度的办法，是各项工作取得跃进胜利的保证和先决条件。武汉市的医务工作者，在各级党委的领导与教育下，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻了面向生产，服务生产的方针，扭转了“医不叩门”、“坐院行医”脱离生产脱离群众的资产阶级思想作风，和不相信群众、害怕群众运动的非无产阶级观点。从而开始深入农村、街道、工厂和工地，就地行医和进行疾病防治工作，受到工人、农民的欢迎。同时由于接触了生产实际，感受到工人、农民干劲的鼓舞和工人阶级思想的影响，特别是学习了毛主席的著作，大大地提高了医务工作者的政治觉悟水平和工作积极性，获得了思想业务双丰收，这确是有利于我们知识分子改造的一条很好的红专道路。
    根据中央第六次血防会议三年规划两年完成的精神，我们针对着这一总的要求和目的，力争全市在今年国庆节前消灭六害、六病，今冬明春扫尾巩固。不但在公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活组织中，加强指导和监督进行食具消毒，提倡分食、分筷、分巾，劝止随地吐痰，养成群众讲卫生、爱清洁的良好习惯，作到深入的和全面地管理好粪管和粪检工作。同时结合农田水利、改良土壤和市政建设，大搞群众运动，大抓治本工程，消灭疫区，根治湖塘、整顿下水道、化粪池、厕所等病害传播的孳生场所，进一步地作到综合性的治本工作。可以预期，武汉市的卫生工作，在党的正确领导下，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻预防为主的方针，用大搞群众运动，大插红旗，广树标兵的办法，就一定能够迅速地改变武汉市的卫生面貌，以适应工农业生产发展和人民文化生活的需要。（附图片）
