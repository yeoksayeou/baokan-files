Learning from Lenin's Fighting Spirit
\tXu Bangyi

Lenin once said in a letter to Gorky:

"…Once a member recognizes that a certain theory is extremely wrong and harmful, he must rise up to oppose it. If I were not absolutely convinced (and the more I read the works of Bazarov, Bogdanov and the like, the more I am convinced) that their works, from beginning to end, from the smallest detail to the root (up to Mach and Avenarius), are completely absurd, harmful, vulgar, and didactic, I would not argue. Plekhanov is essentially completely correct in opposing them, but he either cannot or does not want to or is too lazy to express his views concretely, meticulously, and concisely, but instead uses profound philosophy to scare these people. I must express my opposition in my own way.

"Dear A.M., what 'reconciliation' is there here? Don't even think about it, it's ridiculous to talk about reconciliation. Struggle is absolutely inevitable. Party members should not try to cover up, delay, or avoid struggle, but should strive to ensure that the work actually needed by the Party is not harmed."

Lenin's life was a life of struggle. He never "reconciled" with any ideological trends that betrayed Marxism.

In Lenin's time, various revisionists and opportunists were once rampant, and they viciously launched a comprehensive attack on Marxism and the vanguard of the proletariat. They tried to replace Marxism with revisionism and opportunism politically, ideologically, theoretically, and organizationally, and they tried their best to serve the bourgeoisie and oppose the proletariat. Under the circumstances at that time, it was impossible to establish a revolutionary party, to carry out the proletarian revolution, and to realize the proletarian dictatorship without thoroughly crushing the revisionist and opportunist trends of thought. Throughout Lenin's life, he had to fight against various revisionists and opportunists with great energy. This struggle was a profound manifestation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and this struggle was inevitable and unavoidable. This was a question concerning the fate of the world's proletariat and all mankind.

Revisionists and opportunists spread a large amount of poison in the ranks of the proletariat and among the masses of the people. However, this poison is not immediately recognized by people. This is because this poison is packaged in sugar coating. The characteristic of revisionists and opportunists, as Lenin repeatedly exposed, is that they often disguise themselves as Marxists, plagiarize Marxist words, distort Marxism, and abandon the revolutionary essence of Marxism; or they proclaim that the basic principles of Marxism are "outdated," that they want to be anti-"dogmatic," and that they want to replace it with their own "new" principles; in addition, they often use some "beautiful" and vague language to deceive the masses, cater to the backward mentality of the masses, and pretend to be "objective" and without "prejudice"; and so on. The struggle against revisionists and opportunists cannot but be a serious battle. In the struggle, there must be a high degree of sensitivity, clarity, and firmness, that is, a high degree of Party spirit. The high degree of Party spirit and adherence to principles shown by Lenin in his struggle against revisionists and opportunists is an example for all of us Communists.

Lenin once incisively pointed out in "The Collapse of the Second International": "The main content of opportunism is the idea of class cooperation."

The idea of class cooperation of revisionists and opportunists is the idea of not wanting revolution, not wanting struggle, not wanting dictatorship, but wanting reform, wanting "peace," and wanting "democracy." But how many disguised masks and deceptive tricks have revisionists and opportunists played in order to sell their wares! Sometimes they do not openly oppose Marx's idea of class struggle and the idea of proletarian dictatorship on the surface, and sometimes they even talk about class struggle and proletarian dictatorship in empty words. The traitor Kautsky was like this. What kind of stuff was Kautsky's "proletarian dictatorship"? That is the idea of not seizing power by violence, but only of "peacefully" obtaining a majority under the bourgeois "democratic system," that is, the peaceful growth of capitalism into socialism. In order to sell his goods, he also quoted and distorted Marx's meaning. Lenin's rebuttal of this shameful traitor was very powerful. In response to Kautsky's argument, Lenin pointed out: "It is sophistry to use the excuse that Marx once believed in the 1870s that Britain and the United States could peacefully transition to socialism, to put it simply, it is using quotations to deceive people. First, even then Marx considered this possibility to be an exception; second, there was no monopoly capitalism, that is, imperialism, at that time; third, Britain and the United States did not have (and now have) militarism—the main institution of the bourgeois state machine." ("The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky")

Revisionists and opportunists also often put forward the slogans of "democracy" and "freedom" to deceive the masses. However, the "democracy" and "freedom" they talk about are always linked to the words "pure," "absolute," "general," "unlimited," and "national." Lenin's exposure of their tricks was also relentless. Lenin pointed out that those things said by revisionists and opportunists do not exist in the world, and that what exists in the world is only class "democracy" and class "freedom," and that their slogans of "democracy" and "freedom" demand nothing more than the corruption of the working class with bourgeois ideology.

We can say that all the views and fallacies of revisionism and opportunism that appeared in Lenin's era, such as "the movement is everything, the ultimate goal is nothing," "economic struggle is the most universal and applicable means to attract the masses to participate in political movements," "peaceful growth into socialism," etc., were all severely criticized by Lenin. Lenin always貫穿贯穿(guànchuān)貫穿(guànchuān)贯穿(guànchuān) (貫穿) the principle of proletarian Party spirit in his criticism. Every word Lenin said was like a bullet.

Firm position, strict boundaries, clear views, analytical methods, sharp criticism, this is Lenin's Party spirit, Lenin's principles, Lenin's attitude!

In our era, modern revisionists and opportunists are spreading a large amount of poison again. As a Communist, what should we do?

Without a doubt, we must learn from Lenin, we must consult Lenin. We must believe like Lenin that only scientific socialism and the doctrine of class struggle are revolutionary theories that can serve as the banner of the revolutionary movement.

We must fight! We must hold high the banner of Lenin!

    学习列宁的战斗精神
    许邦仪
    列宁在给高尔基的一封信中这样讲过：
    “……一个党员一旦认识到某种学说是极端错误和有害时，就必须起来反对这种学说。如果我不是绝对相信（我愈是阅读巴札罗夫、波格丹诺夫之流的著作，就愈相信）他们的著作从头至尾，从叶至根（直到马赫和阿芬那留斯）都完全是荒谬、有害、庸俗、说教的作品，我也不会来争论的。普列汉诺夫反对他们实质上是完全正确的，只是他不会或者不想或者懒于具体地、细致地、简明地说出自己的看法，而是用深奥的哲理来吓唬这些人。我无论如何要按自己的方式说出自己的反对意见。
    “亲爱的阿·马，这里有什么‘和解’可言呢？别那么想了，提和解是可笑的。斗争绝对不可避免。党员不应力图掩盖、拖延或回避斗争，而应力争使党实际上所需要的工作不受损害。”
    列宁的一生，正是战斗的一生。他对于一切背弃马克思主义的思想倾向，从来没有“和解”过。
    在列宁的时代，各种修正主义和机会主义者曾经是疯狂一时，他们极恶毒地向马克思主义和向无产阶级的先锋队实行了全面的进攻。他们从政治上、思想上、理论上和组织上都力图以修正主义和机会主义来代替马克思主义，他们竭力为资产阶级效劳而反对无产阶级。在当时的情况下，不彻底粉碎修正主义和机会主义的思潮，要建立一个革命的政党，要实行无产阶级革命和实现无产阶级专政，是不可能的。在列宁的一生中，就不得不以极大的精力来同各种修正主义和机会主义者进行战斗。这种战斗是无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争的一种深刻的表现，这种战斗是不可避免的，要回避这种战斗也是不行的。这是关系全世界无产阶级和全人类命运的问题。
    修正主义和机会主义者在无产阶级队伍中和在人民群众中大量地散布了毒素。可是这种毒素并不是一下子就会被人们所识破。这是由于这种毒素是用糖衣包装起来的。修正主义和机会主义者的特点，如同列宁所曾一再揭露的，就是他们往往把自己伪装成为马克思主义者，剽窃马克思主义的词句，对马克思主义加以歪曲，抛弃马克思主义的革命实质；或者他们就是宣扬马克思主义基本原理的“过时”，他们要反“教条”，要以他们创立的“新”原理来代替；另外他们往往用一些“漂亮”的、模糊不清的语言来欺骗群众，迎合群众的落后心理，把自己装着是“客观”的和没有“偏见”的；如此等等。对修正主义和机会主义者的斗争，不能不是一场严肃的战斗。在斗争中要有高度的敏锐性、明确性和坚定性，也就是要有高度的党性。列宁在同修正主义和机会主义者作斗争中表现出来的高度党性和坚持原则的精神，是我们所有共产党人的范例。
    列宁曾经在“第二国际的破产”一文中一针见血地指出：“机会主义的主要内容就是阶级合作的思想”。
    修正主义和机会主义者的阶级合作思想，就是不要革命、不要斗争、不要专政而只要改良、只要“和平”、只要“民主”的思想。可是修正主义和机会主义者为了贩卖他们的货色，是做了多少伪装的假面具和玩弄了多少骗人的手法呵！他们有时在表面上并不公开反对马克思的阶级斗争思想和无产阶级专政思想，并且他们有时还在口头上空谈阶级斗争和无产阶级专政。像叛徒考茨基就是这样的。考茨基的“无产阶级专政”是什么货色呢？那就是不要用暴力夺取政权，而只要在资产阶级“民主制度”下，“和平地”获得大多数，即是资本主义和平长入社会主义的思想。他为了出售他的货色，还引证与曲解马克思的意思。对这种可耻的叛徒，列宁的驳斥是十分有力的。列宁针对考茨基的论点指出：“借口马克思在七十年代曾经认为英国和美国可能和平过渡到社会主义，这是诡辩，通俗一点说，这是用引证来骗人。第一、就在当时马克思也认为这种可能是一个例外；第二、当时还没有垄断资本主义即帝国主义；第三、英国和美国当时没有（现在有了）军阀制度——资产阶级国家机器的主要机构。”（“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”）
    修正主义和机会主义者还常常提出“民主”、“自由”的口号来欺骗群众。不过他们谈论的“民主”和“自由”总是和“纯粹的”、“绝对的”、“一般的”、“无限的”、“全民的”词句联系在一起。列宁对他们所行的骗术的揭穿，也是毫不留情的。列宁指出修正主义和机会主义者所说的那些东西在世界上是不存在的，世界上存在的只有阶级的“民主”和阶级的“自由”，他们的“民主”和“自由”的口号所要求的无非是以资产阶级思想来腐蚀工人阶级。
    我们可以说，在列宁那个时代所出现的修正主义和机会主义的所有观点和种种谬论，如什么“运动就是一切，最终目的算不得什么”啦，什么“经济斗争是吸引群众参加政治运动的最普遍适用的手段”啦，什么“和平长入社会主义”啦，等等，都受到了列宁严正的批判。列宁在批判中始终贯穿无产阶级的党性原则。列宁所说的每一句话都像一颗子弹。
    坚定的立场，严格的界限，明确的观点，分析的方法，尖锐的批判，这就是列宁的党性，列宁的原则，列宁的态度！
    在我们这个时代，现代修正主义和机会主义者又在散布大量的毒素，作为一个共产党员，我们应当怎样做呢？
    毫无疑问，我们要向列宁学习，要向列宁请教。我们要像列宁一样坚信，现在只有科学社会主义和阶级斗争的学说，才是革命理论，才能作为革命运动的旗帜。
    我们一定要战斗！我们一定要高举列宁的旗帜！
