Xinhua News Agency, Athens, April 13th - According to TASS, Athens, April 12th: The Athens Military Tribunal, based on the fabricated charge of so-called "engaging in espionage," sentenced six Greek communists to life imprisonment on the 12th. They are: Eritriadis, Filinis, Patsalidis, Triadafil, Sachariadis, and Eritriad. The other six people tried with them were acquitted.

The prosecutor said during the sentencing that being a member of the Greek Communist Party, which has already been declared illegal, is sufficient to constitute the crime of "engaging in espionage" and therefore be subject to trial.

In their defense speeches in court, these patriots vigorously defended the Greek Communist Party and defended democracy and peace. Their speeches also revealed that the "crimes" imposed on them by the Greek authorities were purely fabricated. These speeches have left a deep impression on the Greek public. Even the reactionary "Castle Daily" had to admit that the courageous spirit shown by the defendants stemmed from their firm belief in the cause and principles of communism.

The day before, after the Athens Court of Appeals heard Glezos's appeal against the verdict of the Athens Criminal Court, Manolis Glezos was once again escorted back to the medieval prison for criminals on Corfu Island. According to Glezos recently, he is being held in the death row cells of this prison.

    虚构罪名迫害和平民主战士
    希腊当局竟判处六名爱国者无期徒刑
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社雅典12日讯：雅典军事法庭根据所谓“从事间谍活动”的诬告，12日判处六名希腊共产党人以无期徒刑。他们是：埃里特里阿迪斯，菲利尼斯，帕察利迪，特里阿达菲尔，萨哈利阿第斯和埃里特里阿德。同他们一起受审的其他六个人被宣告无罪释放。
    检察长在宣判的时候说，只要是已经被宣布为非法了的希腊共产党的党员，就足以构成“进行间谍活动”的罪名并因此受到审讯。
    这些爱国者在法庭上的辩护发言中，有力地维护希腊共产党，维护民主、和平。他们的发言也揭露了希腊当局加在他们头上的“罪名”纯属虚构。这些发言已经在希腊公众中留下了深刻的印象，连反动的“城堡报”也不得不承认，被告们表现的这种勇敢精神是出于对共产主义的事业和原则的坚定信念。
    在这前一天，在雅典上诉法院审理了格列索斯对雅典刑事法庭的判决提出的上诉以后，曼诺里斯·格列索斯又重新被押回科孚岛上为刑事犯设立的中世纪的监狱里去。据格列索斯不久前说，他被监禁在这个监狱的死刑犯的牢房中。
