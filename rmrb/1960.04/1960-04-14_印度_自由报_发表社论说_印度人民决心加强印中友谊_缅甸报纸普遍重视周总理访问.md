Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 13th: The Indian Bengali newspaper "Liberty" published an editorial on the 12th, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's profound belief in Sino-Indian friendship.

The newspaper strongly condemned the ugly farce of the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" recently staged in New Delhi by a small group of reactionary elements in India. It said, "The Indian people are determined to smash the imperialist conspiracy and strengthen Sino-Indian friendly relations."

The editorial said that just as the Prime Ministers and peoples of India and China were preparing to move towards resolving border disputes through peaceful mutual negotiations, Narayan, the head of the Indian People's Socialist Party, held the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" in New Delhi, attempting to poison the atmosphere in India. The editorial pointed out that the entire Tibet issue is China's internal affair. Narayan and figures like Rajagopalachari, the leader of the Free Party, should understand that the peace-loving Indian people do not support their policies, because this is a conspiracy planned by American imperialism on Asian territory. The words spoken by Narayan and Rajagopalachari at the "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" were no different from the remarks of American warmongers. Imperialism hopes that the Sino-Indian talks will fail.

The editorial said that the people of independent Asian countries have learned through arduous liberation struggles how to defeat imperialist conspiracies. Narayan and his ilk's attempt to make people forget this lesson will not succeed. The Indian people have thrown their fallacies into the dustbin of history.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 13th: Almost all newspapers in Rangoon today published news about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma in a prominent position. "The Nation" carried the news under a three-column headline: "Zhou Enlai's Visit Will Further Strengthen Sino-Burmese Friendship." "The Guardian" carried a headline in the top position on the front page: "U Nu and Zhou Enlai will participate in the Water Festival on April 15th," and published a photo of Premier Zhou Enlai and former Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win. The caption of the photo was: "Reunion: Premier Zhou Enlai will meet his old friend in Burma when he comes here soon to participate in Burma's Water Festival."

Another English newspaper, "The Burma New Times," also published this news on the front page. "The Burma New Times" also reprinted the editorial of the Beijing "People's Daily" on the same page: "A New Stage in Sino-Burmese Friendly Relations."

    印度“自由报”发表社论说
    印度人民决心加强印中友谊
    缅甸报纸普遍重视周总理访问
    新华社新德里13日电　印度孟加拉文的“自由报”在12日发表社论，热烈欢迎周恩来总理对中印友好关系所抱的深邃的信念。
    这家报纸强烈谴责印度一小撮反动分子最近在新德里上演的所谓“亚非西藏会议”的丑剧。它说，“印度人民决心粉碎帝国主义的阴谋，加强印中友好关系。”
    社论说，正当印中两国总理和人民准备通过相互和平的谈判朝着解决边界纠纷的方向前进时，印度人民社会党头子纳拉扬在新德里举行了所谓“亚非西藏会议”，企图毒化印度国内的气氛。社论指出，整个西藏问题是中国的内政。纳拉扬和自由党首领拉贾戈帕拉查里之流应该懂得，爱好和平的印度人民并不支持他们的政策，因为这是美帝国主义在亚洲领土上所策划的阴谋。纳拉扬和拉贾戈帕拉查里在“亚非西藏会议”上所讲的话同美国战争贩子的言论没有丝毫不同，帝国主义希望印中会谈将会失败。
    社论说，独立的亚洲国家的人民通过艰难的解放斗争已经学会了如何击败帝国主义的阴谋。纳拉扬之流企图使人民忘记这个教训，是不会得逞的。印度人民已经把他们的谬论抛入历史的垃圾箱。
    据新华社仰光13日电　仰光几乎所有的报纸今天以显著地位刊载了关于周恩来总理要来缅甸访问的消息。“联邦报”以三栏标题“周恩来的来访将进一步加强中缅友谊”刊载了这项消息。“卫报”在头版上的头号大标题是：“吴努和周恩来将在4月15日参加泼水节”，并且登载了周恩来总理和前缅甸总理奈温将军合拍的照片。照片的说明是：“重聚：不久周恩来总理前来这里参加缅甸的泼水节的时候，将会晤他在缅甸的老朋友。”
    另一家英文报纸“缅甸新时代报”也在头版上刊登了这个消息。“缅甸新时代报”还在同一版上转载了北京“人民日报”的社论：“中缅友好关系的新阶段”。
