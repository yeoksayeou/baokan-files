Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 13th. Vietnam's "People's Daily" today published an article warmly praising the great achievements of the Chinese people in the continuous leap forward.

The article first pointed out that the 1960 National Economic Plan adopted by the National People's Congress of China is a great plan for continued leap forward. The article said that the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people of the world are rejoiced by China's continued leap forward and believe that this is an important contribution to the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.

The article pointed out that "The Chinese dragon has taken off, and it shows the strong vitality and incomparable superiority of socialism. Compared with the aging capitalist countries, China has obviously already surpassed and is surpassing them in many aspects."

After introducing in detail the 1960 Chinese national economic plan and the various leap forward targets of industrial and agricultural production, the article pointed out, "China's great practice in the past two years and this year's great plan are irrefutable facts, which have shattered the reactionary imperialist slander that China has suffered "failure" in economic construction. Its brilliant light has also dispelled the doubts of some people about when China will continue to leap forward and whether China can continue to leap forward."

The article said, "The important reports of the leading comrades of the Chinese Party and government at the National People's Congress and the speeches of hundreds of representatives showed the strong will and actual strength of the 650 million Chinese people." The article said that China is leaping forward and will continue to leap forward steadily, firmly, and for a long time.

The article also said, "This year is the third year of China's leap forward 'era'. After only two years of practice, everyone has clearly seen the abundant vitality of the "three magic weapons" of socialist construction put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as well as a series of "walking on two legs" policies accompanying the General Line."

The article said, "China is constantly becoming stronger. China's great achievements have made extremely important contributions to the common strength of the socialist camp. In the peace competition that has a decisive significance for the development of the world, along with the Soviet Union's strides forward, China's Great Leap Forward achievements have great significance."

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, April 13th. Yangon newspapers warmly praised the resolution on the 1960 National Economic Plan passed by the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China.

Today's editorial in the "Myanmar New Era Newspaper" said that it is clear that China is progressing well on the road to planned prosperity, and its economic goals will certainly be achieved.

The editorial also said that China's people's commune system is China's way to accelerate development, change its backward state, and surpass Western industrial levels. The editorial said that the Chinese government is determined to increase production in industry and agriculture and to catch up with and surpass Britain in major industrial products within ten years. Therefore, it needs a peaceful environment.

The Yangon "People's Daily" recently praised the Chinese National People's Congress meeting as a conference for the people of the whole country to continue to leap forward towards new and great goals in an article entitled "The Chinese People are Happily Moving Forward by Leaps and Bounds."

The newspaper said that the 1960 National Economic Plan and budget passed by the National People's Congress ensured this year's continued leap forward.

When talking about the imperialists' slander against China's continued leap forward this year, the newspaper said that the imperialists' slanders and curses, as well as imperialism itself, will eventually be thrown into the trash can, while China will continue to move forward. "New Yangon Newspaper" talked about the development of China's steel industry in an article, saying that China's steel production in 1949 was 150,000 tons, and this year it will reach more than 18 million tons, which is the Great Leap Forward. This rate of growth has never been seen in world history.

    新华社河内13日电　越南“人民报”今天发表文章热烈赞扬中国人民在连续跃进中取得的伟大成就。
    文章首先指出，中国全国人民代表大会通过的1960年国民经济计划是一个伟大的继续跃进的计划。文章说，社会主义国家人民和世界爱好和平的人民都为中国的继续跃进而欢欣鼓舞，并且认为这是对保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争作出了重要的贡献。
    文章指出，“中国巨龙已经腾空而起，它显示了社会主义的强大的生命力和无比的优越性。同衰老的资本主义国家比较，中国显然已经并且正在多方面超过它们”。
    文章在详细地介绍了1960年中国的国民经济计划和工农业生产的各项跃进指标后指出，“中国在过去两年中的伟大实践和今年的伟大计划，就是无可辩驳的事实，它粉碎了反动的帝国主义叫嚣中国在经济建设方面遭到“失败”的谰言。它的灿烂的光芒也驱散了一些人对于中国还跃进到什么时候、中国能不能继续跃进等等的怀疑”。
    文章说，“中国党和政府领导同志在中国人民代表大会上的重要报告和几百个代表的发言，表明了中国六亿五千万人民的坚强的意志和实际力量。”文章说，中国正在跃进，并将持续地、稳固地、长期地跃进。
    文章还说，“今年是中国跃进‘纪元’中的第三年，仅仅两年的实践，大家就清楚地看到了中国共产党和毛泽东同志提出的社会主义建设的“三件法宝”：总路线、大跃进和人民公社以及伴随着总路线的一系列“两条腿走路”的方针的充沛的生命力。”
    文章说，“中国正在不断地强大。中国的巨大的成就为社会主义阵营的共同强大作出了极为重要的贡献。在对世界的发展有着决定性意义的和平竞赛中，在苏联大步迈进的同时，中国大跃进的成就具有重大的意义。”
    新华社仰光13日电　仰光报纸热烈赞扬中国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的关于1960年国民经济计划。
    “缅甸新时代报”今天的社论说，显然，中国在朝着有计划的繁荣的道路上走得很好，它的经济目标一定会实现。
    社论又说，中国的人民公社制度是中国加速发展和改变落后状态和超过西方工业水平的办法。社论说，中国政府决心要在工农业方面增加生产，并且要在十年以内在主要工业产品方面赶上和超过英国。因此，它需要一个和平环境。
    仰光“人民报”最近在题为“中国人民在愉快地大踏步前进”的文章中，赞扬中国全国人民代表大会会议是全国人民向新的伟大目标继续跃进的大会。
    这家报纸说，全国人民代表大会通过的1960年国民经济计划和预算保证了今年的继续跃进。
    这家报纸在谈到帝国主义对中国今年继续跃进的诬蔑时说，帝国主义者的谰言和咒骂以及帝国主义本身将终于被扔到垃圾箱里，而中国将继续向前迈进。“新仰光报”在文章中谈到中国钢铁工业的发展时说，中国的钢产量在1949年是十五万吨，今年将达到一千八百多万吨，这就是大跃进。这种增长的速度在世界历史上是从来没有过的。
