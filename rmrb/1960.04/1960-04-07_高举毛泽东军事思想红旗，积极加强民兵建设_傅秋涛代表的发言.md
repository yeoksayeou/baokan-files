Comrades Chairman and fellow delegates:
    I fully endorse the two reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. These two reports summarize the great achievements since the Great Leap Forward and put forward a magnificent plan for continuing the leap forward in 1960. It vividly illustrates that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, have achieved great victories in building socialism. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Based on this victory, we will surely be able to achieve a more comprehensive and sustained great leap forward, complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, and move from victory to victory.
    Now, I would like to express some opinions on the militia issue:
    Since the Great Leap Forward, China's militia building, like other construction undertakings, has also achieved great achievements.
    The mass establishment of militia divisions and the implementation of the movement of all people as soldiers developed in the autumn of 1958, during the serious military provocations by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait, under the great call of Comrade Mao Zedong, and in the context of the vigorous development of the Great Leap Forward in production and the people's commune movement. Over the past two years, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, with the continuous great leap forward in socialist construction and the increasing consolidation and development of the people's communes, militia building has entered a new stage of development. Since the rural areas have realized the people's communes which are large in size and public in nature, combining workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrating government administration with commune management, the militia organization, as a component of the people's commune, has developed from the past squads, platoons, and companies into militia divisions and regiments. The scope of the militia has expanded, and the number of people has increased. The vast number of able-bodied women who have been liberated from housework have also enthusiastically joined the militia organization. Cities across the country have also universally established militia divisions and regiments, and millions of industrial workers, revolutionary young intellectuals, and staff members have enthusiastically joined the militia ranks, which has greatly strengthened the backbone and technical forces of the militia. Under the unified leadership and overall planning of the People's Commune Party Committee, militia building is fully integrated with all walks of life, including industry, agriculture, commerce, and education, thereby promoting mutual progress and common development. As new cities and industrial and mining bases increase daily, the working class continues to develop, and demobilized and retired soldiers increase year by year, our militia building will increasingly meet the requirements of modern national defense construction.
    The mass establishment of militia divisions is an important component of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to militia building, regarding the militia as a powerful assistant and strong reserve force for the People's Liberation Army. With the support and coordination of the regular troops, the militia is a powerful tool for defending the revolutionary regime and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and is a solid foundation in terms of manpower for implementing people's war. In the long revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong has always valued the great role of the people. He said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Precisely from this fundamental viewpoint of historical materialism, he repeatedly emphasized that the whole Party and the whole army should boldly mobilize the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and implement a people's war combining the main force troops, local troops, and the militia, and combining armed and unarmed masses. Historical experience proves that in the past, when the strength of the enemy and ourselves was disparate, our Party was able to establish and consolidate revolutionary base areas, implement the strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside, and finally seize the cities; our army was able to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and constantly develop and grow stronger; and was able to defeat powerful enemies at home and abroad with inferior equipment and win the victory of the people's revolutionary war. This was because we followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, closely relied on the organized and armed broad masses of working people, and implemented people's war. During the period of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "We must not only have a powerful regular army, but we must also vigorously establish militia divisions." This means that, on the one hand, we must further strengthen the building of the People's Liberation Army to make it an excellent modernized revolutionary army; on the other hand, we must strengthen militia building, organize able-bodied men and women citizens on a voluntary basis in the form of militia organizations, and strengthen militia building in terms of organization and command, cadre allocation, military training, and political education. Combining the building of the regular army with the building of the militia as a whole, implementing the principle of "walking on two legs," is Comrade Mao Zedong's idea that "the army and the people are the foundation of victory." Taking Mao Zedong Thought as a guide is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous victory of all our construction undertakings, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for the continuous victory of militia building.
    The mass establishment of militia divisions is an important measure for our people to defend against imperialist aggression and protect the cause of socialist construction.
    There are still a small handful of reactionaries in the world who are unwilling to accept their defeat in China and always want to sabotage our cause of socialist construction. Now, U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, establishes a network of military bases and missile networks near our country, constantly violates our airspace and territorial waters, conducts military provocations, and threatens the security of our motherland. The war-mongers in the United States, while waving the banner of peace in an attempt to paralyze the people of the world, are intensifying preparations for war, desperately developing missiles, and supporting Japanese and West German militarism, betting on a new war of aggression. We are a socialist country, and we adhere to peace and oppose wars of aggression. But if imperialism is determined to launch a war, we are not afraid of war either. We never invade others, but we will not allow others to invade us. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack." While we are engaged in peaceful construction, we must be vigilant against the threat of imperialist aggression against our country. As long as imperialism exists, the danger of war exists. Imperialism has always been accustomed to perfidy, using sudden attacks to carry out wars of aggression. All our people must remain vigilant, strengthen militia building, implement universal armed self-defense, and prepare for defense against imperialist wars of aggression. The militia best embodies the breadth of people's war and is the eyes, ears, limbs and most reliable reserve force of the army. With such a powerful militia force, we can enable the army to free up manpower and financial resources in peacetime to strengthen economic construction; recruit and mobilize new soldiers from the militia every year to supplement the active forces and strengthen the construction of the troops; and soldiers who have completed their active service in the troops return to the militia as the backbone of the militia, continuously enhancing the combat effectiveness of the militia and better cooperating with the troops to defend the coastal and border defenses. In wartime, we can guarantee the supplementation and expansion of the troops in a faster, better, and more economical way; we can cooperate with the troops in combat, attack the enemy everywhere, making it difficult for the enemy to move an inch; and we can also effectively counter air landings and air raids, protect production, maintain transportation, consolidate the rear, and allow the front-line troops to have no worries. We not only need to strengthen militia building, but also can do a good job in militia building. This is because we have the correct leadership of the Party, the hardworking and brave people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the superior socialist system, the superior conditions of the people's communes, the militia system that is popular with the people of our country, and millions of demobilized and transferred soldiers who have been tempered in war as the backbone. In this way, the combination of our universal arming and the regular army can form a people's national defense like a wall of bronze.
    The mass establishment of militia divisions has a significant promoting effect on the sustained Great Leap Forward in production.
    As Comrade Mao Zedong said, China's militia "is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization." This is an organically combined unity, a scientific summary of the nature and characteristics of the militia in the era of the people's communes, and a major development of the principle of "combining labor and military affairs" during the past war period under the conditions of socialist construction. During the period of peaceful construction, the most basic activity of the militia is production activity, because hundreds of millions of militiamen are both civilians and soldiers, the main force on the production front, and the backbone of building socialism. Therefore, militia work must take production as the key link. Only on the premise of doing a good job in production can we better strengthen militia building. It is a very obvious principle that a country must be rich before its military can be strong. Since the Great Leap Forward in production and the communization of the people, the broad masses of people have carried out large-scale production activities, which require more organization, more discipline, and more order to improve labor efficiency, play a greater role, and better conquer nature. The organization of militia divisions and regiments also developed under such a Great Leap Forward situation. And the development of militia divisions and regiments is more conducive to large-scale cooperation and promotes the Great Leap Forward in production. Over the past two years, whether in the great steel smelting, the great coal mining, the deep plowing of land, the construction of water conservancy projects, flood prevention and disaster relief, drainage and drought resistance, pig raising and manure accumulation, mountain opening and road construction, afforestation, short-distance transportation, elimination of animal pests, or the great technical revolution and great cultural revolution movements, the militia has played an active role, becoming a handy strike force under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. Wherever the Party committee points, they rush there. Wherever the task is heavy, difficult, and time is urgent, the militia takes the lead and takes the lead in assaults, giving full play to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, and successfully completing various tasks. Now, the country is vigorously carrying out the technical revolution and technical innovation, the communization of urban people, the mass establishment of public canteens, and the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests. The militia divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies in various places have naturally become the backbone force in carrying out these movements, especially the millions of demobilized and retired soldiers, who have received systematic education in the army, have higher political awareness, stronger organizational discipline, and have mastered certain technical knowledge and have a certain working ability, are even more important guarantees for the victory of various movements. Therefore, giving full play to the organizational strength of the militia and mobilizing the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of militiamen and the broad masses of demobilized and retired soldiers has a very significant meaning for accelerating various socialist constructions.
    The mass establishment of militia divisions also plays a great role in changing the people's spiritual outlook and improving the people's socialist and communist consciousness.
    The militia has a glorious revolutionary tradition and a relatively strict organization. When they carry out production activities with the broad masses of people, they implement the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, the collectivization of life, and the democratization of management. Through the collective labor training of the militia and frequent political life, they can further improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the militia, and can cultivate the militia's style of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. When performing various tasks, they are not afraid of difficulties, are not afraid of dangers, are full of fighting spirit, and are full of vigor, showing a noble communist style. Creating a political situation that has both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual ease of mind, liveliness and vitality. Under the premise of obeying production and focusing on the central work, the broad masses of militiamen, closely combining national defense and sports activities, extensively carry out various diverse, lively military training and amateur martial arts activities. The militia training situation in the past two years has proved that as long as it is good at combining and as long as the method is correct, militia training not only does not affect production, but also achieves double harvests, both exercising physical fitness and increasing military knowledge, and promoting production, work, and study. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Participating in the militia and conducting military training, the people's physical fitness will quickly improve, workers and farmers will produce better, students will study better, and cadres will work better." Therefore, grasping the militia organization, strengthening military training and physical exercise, strengthening political work, further giving play to their style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, carrying forward the glorious traditional style of the People's Liberation Army and the militia, and training them into comprehensive talents who are both literary and military, both red and expert, are of great benefit to promoting production, work, and study, changing customs, transforming people's spiritual outlook, improving communist moral character, and accelerating socialist construction.
    At present, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, China's socialist construction has achieved brilliant achievements, and the whole country is showing a prosperous and flourishing scene. The people of the whole country are united, determined to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense. Our future is infinitely bright. We are determined to hold even higher the glorious banner of Mao Zedong's military thought, actively strengthen militia building, and bravely advance to defend China's socialist construction and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

专栏：

    高举毛泽东军事思想红旗，积极加强民兵建设
    傅秋涛代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理的两个报告。这两个报告，总结了大跃进以来的伟大成就，提出了1960年继续跃进的宏伟规划。它生动地说明，我国人民在党的领导下，已经取得建设社会主义的巨大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利。在这个胜利的基础上，我们一定能够更全面地持续大跃进，完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，从胜利走向胜利。
    现在，我就民兵问题，发表一点意见：
    大跃进以来，我国的民兵建设同其它的建设事业一样，也获得了巨大的成就
    大办民兵师，实行全民皆兵运动，是在1958年秋天，美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡进行严重军事挑衅的时候，在毛泽东同志的伟大号召下发展起来的，是在生产大跃进和人民公社化运动蓬勃开展的形势下发展起来的。两年来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，随着社会主义建设的连续大跃进，随着人民公社的日益巩固和发展，民兵建设已经进入了一个新的发展阶段。由于农村实现了一大二公的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社，民兵组织是人民公社的组成部分，已由过去的小队、中队、大队，发展成为民兵师、团。民兵范围扩大了，人数增多了，从家务中解放出来的广大壮年妇女，也踊跃地参加了民兵组织。全国城市也普遍建立了民兵师、团，千百万产业工人、革命知识青年和职员，踊跃地加入了民兵队伍，这就大大地加强了民兵的骨干力量和技术力量。民兵建设在人民公社党委的统一领导和统筹安排下，与工、农、商、学各行各业全面地结合起来，这样就得到了互相促进，共同发展。随着新的城市和厂矿基地日益增加，工人阶级队伍日益发展，复员退伍军人逐年增多，我们的民兵建设也将日益符合现代化国防建设的要求。
    大办民兵师，这是毛泽东同志军事思想的重要组成部分
    毛泽东同志向来十分重视民兵建设，把民兵作为人民解放军有力助手和强大的后备力量，在正规部队的支援和配合之下，民兵是保卫革命政权、巩固人民民主专政的一种强有力的工具，是实行人民战争人力方面的雄厚基础。在长期的革命战争中，毛泽东同志一向重视人民群众的伟大作用，他说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”他正是从这个历史唯物主义的根本观点出发，反复强调指出：全党全军要放手发动群众，组织群众，武装群众，实行主力部队、地方部队和民兵相结合，武装群众和非武装群众相结合的人民战争。历史经验证明：过去在敌我力量悬殊的情况下，我们党能够建立和巩固革命根据地，能够实行以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市；我们的军队能够由小到大，由弱到强，不断地发展壮大；能够以劣势的装备打败国内外强大的敌人，取得人民革命战争的胜利，就是遵循毛泽东同志的指示，紧紧依靠组织起来和武装起来的广大劳动人民，实行人民战争。在社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志指示：“我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。”这就是：一方面，要进一步加强人民解放军的建设，使它成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队；另一方面，要加强民兵建设，以民兵的组织形式，把壮年男女公民在自愿基础上组织起来，并从组织指挥、干部配备、军事训练、政治教育等方面加强民兵建设。把正规军建设和民兵建设结合起来，作为一个整体，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，这是毛泽东同志的“兵民是胜利之本”的思想。以毛泽东同志思想为指针，这是我们一切建设事业不断取得胜利的根本保证，也是民兵建设不断取得胜利的根本保证。
    大办民兵师，这是我国人民防御帝国主义侵略，保卫社会主义建设事业的重要措施
    世界上还是那么一小撮反动派，他们死不甘心在中国的失败，总想破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。现在，美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，在我国附近建立军事基地网和导弹网，不断侵犯我国领空领海，进行军事挑衅，威胁我们祖国的安全。美国的战争贩子，一面打着和平的幌子，企图麻痹全世界人民；一面又加紧备战，拼命发展导弹，扶植日本和西德军国主义，把赌注押在新的侵略战争上面。我们是社会主义国家，我们是坚持和平反对侵略战争的。但如果帝国主义一定要发动战争，我们也不害怕战争。我们从来不侵略别人，但也不容许别人侵略我们。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”我们正在从事和平建设的时候，不能不警惕帝国主义对我国的侵略威胁。只要帝国主义存在，战争的危险就存在。帝国主义历来惯于背信弃义，用突然袭击的方法，进行侵略战争。我们全体人民必须保持警惕，加强民兵建设，实行全民武装自卫，作好防御帝国主义侵略战争的准备。民兵最能体现人民战争的广泛性，是军队的耳目手足和最可靠的后备力量。我们有了这样强大的民兵队伍，在平时就可以使军队腾出人力、财力，加强经济建设；每年从民兵中征集动员新兵，以补充现役部队，加强部队建设；部队服满现役的士兵，回到民兵中去，作为民兵的骨干，不断增强民兵的战斗力，更好地配合部队保卫海陆边防。在战时，就可以保证多快好省地补充和扩大部队；可以配合部队作战，到处打击敌人，使敌人寸步难行；还可以有效地反空降、反空袭、保卫生产，维护交通，巩固后方，使前线部队无后顾之忧。我们不但需要加强民兵建设，而且能够搞好民兵建设，这是由于我们有党的正确领导，有毛泽东思想武装起来的勤劳勇敢的人民，有优越的社会主义制度，有人民公社的优越条件，有我国人民喜闻乐见的民兵制度，有数百万久经战争锻炼的复员转业军人作骨干。这样，使我们的全民武装和正规军结合一起，就能构成铜墙铁壁一样的人民国防。
    大办民兵师，对于生产持续大跃进，有重大促进作用。
    我国的民兵正如毛泽东同志所说的：“这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”这是有机结合的统一体，是人民公社时代民兵的性质和特点的科学概括，是过去战争时期“劳武结合”原则在社会主义建设条件下的重大发展。在和平建设时期，民兵最基本的活动是生产活动，因为亿万民兵，既是民，又是兵，是生产战线上的主力，是建设社会主义的骨干。因此，民兵工作必须以生产为纲。只有在搞好生产的前提下，才能更好的加强民兵建设。先国富而后才兵强，这是很明显的道理。自从生产大跃进、人民公社化以来，广大人民进行大规模的生产活动，需要更有组织，更有纪律，更有秩序，才能提高劳动效率，发挥更大作用，更好地征服大自然。民兵师团的组织，也正是在这样大跃进的形势下发展起来的。而民兵师团的发展，又更利于大协作，促进生产大跃进。两年来，无论在大炼钢铁、大采煤炭、深翻土地、兴修水利、防洪抢险、排涝抗旱、养猪积肥、开山筑路、植树造林、短途运输、消灭兽害，大闹技术革命、大闹文化革命等运动中，民兵都发挥了积极作用，成为各级党委领导下得心应手的突击力量，党委指向那里，他们就奔向那里，那里任务重、困难多、时间急，民兵就一马当先，带头突击，发挥苦干、实干、巧干的精神，胜利地完成各种任务。现在，全国正在轰轰烈烈地开展技术革命和技术革新、城市人民公社化、大办公共食堂、大除四害的爱国卫生等运动。各地民兵师团营连，很自然地成为开展这些运动的骨干力量，特别是数百万复员退伍军人，他们经过部队的系统教育，政治觉悟较高，组织纪律性较强，并掌握有一定的技术知识，有一定的工作能力，更是各项运动取得胜利的重要保证。因此，充分发挥民兵的组织力量，调动亿万民兵和广大复员退伍军人的积极性，对于加速社会主义各项建设，有着非常重大的意义。
    大办民兵师，对改变人民的精神面貌，提高人民的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，也起着很大的作用。
    民兵有光荣的革命传统，有较严密的组织，他们与广大人民在一起进行生产活动的时候，实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化，通过民兵的集体劳动的锻炼和经常的政治生活，能够进一步提高民兵的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，能够培养民兵团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的作风。他们在执行各种任务的时候，不怕困难，不畏艰险，斗志昂扬，意气风发，表现了高贵的共产主义风格。造成了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的那样一种政治局面。在服从生产和围绕中心工作的前提下，广大民兵，紧密地结合国防体育活动，广泛开展了多种多样、生动活泼的军事训练和业余练武活动。二年来的民兵训练情况证明：只要善于结合、只要方法对头，民兵训练不仅不影响生产，而且一举双丰收，既锻炼了体质，增加了军事知识，又促进了生产、工作和学习。正如毛泽东同志所说：“参加民兵，进行军事训练，人民的体质很快就好起来，工人和农民生产更好了，学生学习更好了，干部也工作得更好了。”因此，抓住民兵组织，加强军事训练和体育锻炼，加强政治工作，进一步发挥他们的敢想、敢说、敢干的风格，发扬人民解放军和民兵的光荣传统作风，把他们锻炼成为能文能武、又红又专的全面人材，对于促进生产、工作和学习，移风易俗，改造人们的精神面貌，提高共产主义道德品质，加速社会主义建设，都有很大的好处。
    目前，我国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，社会主义建设事业已经取得辉煌的成就，全国呈现着一片欣欣向荣的繁荣兴旺气象，全国人民团结一致，树雄心，立大志，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，正在努力把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大的社会主义强国。我们的前景无限美好。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东军事思想的光辉旗帜，积极加强民兵建设，为保卫我国社会主义建设，为保卫远东和世界和平而奋勇前进！
    以上发言，如有不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
