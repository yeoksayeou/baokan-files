Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 2nd -- Since liberation fifteen years ago, Hungary's industry has developed very rapidly. At present, the total industrial output value has increased to more than four times the highest pre-liberation production level in 1938, and the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has reached 67%.

The industrial production and construction of People's Hungary was rapidly restored and developed on the basis of being severely damaged by war. Due to the plunder and destruction by fascist Germany during World War II, the production capacity of Hungarian industrial enterprises in 1945 was only 60% of that before liberation, and the production volume was only 30%-35%. Thanks to the selfless labor of the entire Hungarian people, by the end of 1949, industrial production had not only recovered to the pre-war level but also increased by 53% compared with 1938. Although the counter-revolutionary riots in 1956 caused huge losses to the Hungarian economy, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, through the joint efforts of workers and other working people across the country, industrial production had been fully restored by the end of 1957 and continued to move forward by leaps and bounds.

According to statistics, more than 100 large-scale industrial enterprises have been built across the country from 1949 to the present, and a large number of original factories and equipment have been expanded and renovated. Many new industrial sectors have emerged one after another. The new sectors in machine manufacturing alone include comprehensive machine manufacturing, machine tool manufacturing, agricultural machine manufacturing, electrical equipment manufacturing, automobile and tractor manufacturing, and chemical and food machine manufacturing. The metallurgy, coal mining, and chemical industries, which originally had very weak foundations, have also been rapidly developed and consolidated.

Due to the implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization, some major industrial sectors in Hungary have achieved tremendous development. At present, its coal output has increased from 9.36 million tons in 1938 to 25.3 million tons, electricity from 1.39 billion kilowatt-hours to 7.1 billion kilowatt-hours, steel from 647,000 tons to 1,759,000 tons, and oil from 43,000 tons to 1,036,000 tons. Last year, the output of aluminum was equivalent to 45 times that of 1938, and the production of the machine manufacturing industry increased by more than two times compared with 1949, of which the instrument manufacturing industry increased by nine times and the electrical machinery manufacturing industry increased by about three times.

Such a rate of development is unprecedented in Hungary and is beyond the reach of other capitalist countries. Calculated on a per capita basis, many important products in Hungary in 1959 had exceeded the level of some old-brand capitalist countries in 1958. For example, Hungary's per capita annual coal production was more than 2,530 kilograms, while France was 1,299 kilograms and Italy was 14 kilograms; steel—175 kilograms, greatly exceeding Italy and about three times higher than Austria.

With the tremendous development of industrial production and construction, some commercial and agricultural towns before liberation have become industrial centers, and brand-new industrial bases have been established in previously desolate areas. New cities that have appeared on the map of Hungary in the past ten years include the famous steel capital of Stalin City, the chemical and power center of Kazincbarcika, and the coal mine and metallurgical bases of Komló and Várpalota.

In the past three years, Hungary has actively reorganized the structure of industrial production based on its own actual conditions and the possibilities provided by close cooperation with socialist countries. It has vigorously developed the power and chemical industries, and in the machine manufacturing sector, it has focused on developing telecommunications equipment, instruments, high-voltage equipment, and diesel locomotives, which are labor-saving, material-saving, and have a certain technical foundation. This has ensured the balance of production, rapidly improved the technical level, and greatly improved the state of foreign trade.

Under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, Hungary's industrial construction is accelerating day by day. The various indicators of the original three-year plan (1958-1960) have been completed one year ahead of schedule, and the industrial production growth target of this plan is expected to be overfulfilled by 50% by the end of this year. According to the tasks put forward by the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party, during the second five-year plan (1961-1965), industrial production will increase by 65%-70% compared with 1958, and labor productivity will increase by 37%-40%. At that time, Hungary will become more prosperous and strong.

    匈牙利在工业战线上取得辉煌成就
    目前工业总产值增加为解放前最高水平的四倍以上
    随着工业迅速发展出现许多新工业中心和工业基地
    新华社布达佩斯2日电　解放十五年以来，匈牙利的工业发展十分迅速。目前工业总产值已增加为解放前生产水平最高的1938年的四倍以上，工业产值在工农业总产值中所占的比重已达到67％。
    人民匈牙利的工业生产和建设是在备受战争破坏的基础上迅速恢复和发展起来的。由于第二次世界大战期间法西斯德国的掠夺和破坏，1945年匈牙利工业企业的生产能力仅达解放前的60％，而生产量才达到30％—35％。由于全体匈牙利人民的忘我劳动，到1949年年底，工业生产不仅已恢复到了战前的水平，而且比1938年提高了53％。虽然1956年的反革命暴乱使匈牙利经济遭受了巨大的损失，但在社会主义工人党的领导下，经过全国工人和其他劳动人民共同努力，到1957年末工业生产就已完全恢复，并且继续大踏步前进。
    据统计，从1949年到现在，全国共兴建了一百多个大型工业企业，并且扩建和改建了大批原有的工厂与设备。许多新的工业部门相继出现了，单是在机器制造方面的新部门就有综合机器制造业、机床制造业、农业机器制造业、电器设备制造业、汽车和拖拉机制造业、化工和食品机器制造业等。原来基础非常薄弱的冶金、采煤和化学等部门也得到了迅速的发展和巩固。
    由于贯彻了社会主义工业化的方针，匈牙利一些主要的工业部门获得了巨大的发展。目前它的煤产量已由1938年的九百三十六万吨增加到二千五百三十万吨，电力由十三亿九千万度增加到七十一亿度，钢由六十四万七千吨增加到一百七十五万九千吨，石油由四万三千吨增加到一百零三万六千吨。去年铝的产量相当于1938年的四十五倍，机器制造工业的生产比1949年增加了两倍以上，其中仪器制造业增加九倍，电机制造业增加三倍左右。
    这样的发展速度在匈牙利是史无前例的，也是其他资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。按人口平均计算，匈牙利有不少重要产品在1959年就已超过一些老牌资本主义国家1958年的水平。例如，匈牙利按人口平均的煤炭年产量是二千五百三十多公斤，而法国是一千二百九十九公斤，意大利是十四公斤；钢—一百七十五公斤，大大超过了意大利，比奥地利高三倍左右。
    随着工业生产和建设的巨大发展，解放前的一些商业和农业城镇变成了工业中心，在往年荒僻的地区建立了崭新的工业基地。十年来在匈牙利地图上出现的新城市有著名的钢都斯大林城、化学和电力中心卡辛茨巴齐卡、煤矿和冶金基地柯姆洛及瓦尔波洛托等。
    最近三年以来，匈牙利根据本国的实际情况和社会主义国家紧密合作所提供的可能性，积极地改组了工业生产的结构，大力发展了动力和化学工业，在机器制造部门着重发展了电讯器材、仪器，高电压设备及柴油机车等费工省料和有一定技术基础的部门。这样就保证了生产的平衡，迅速提高了技术水平，并大大改善了对外贸易的状况。
    在社会主义工人党的领导下，匈牙利的工业建设正在日益加速地进行。原订三年计划（1958—1960）的各项指标已提前一年完成，这一计划的工业生产增长指标预计到今年年底将超额50％完成。根据社会主义工人党第七次代表大会提出的任务，在第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，工业生产将比1958年提高65％—70％，劳动生产率提高37％—40％，那时，匈牙利将变得更加繁荣富强。
