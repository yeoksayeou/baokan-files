In recent years, after studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, I have come to understand that the primary focus of literary and artistic work should be on political content, followed by artistic quality. As our country progresses rapidly in all directions, I am filled with joy and write some old-style poems each year to celebrate new things.

Now, I also want to make a leap forward in this area. Disregarding my ignorance, I thought to myself: "I started learning poetry at forty, but have yet to achieve success; now I am learning Ci poetry at seventy!" Recently, I have indeed learned to create several pieces. Here, I append three Bodhisattva Man Songs (in praise of the Xin'an River Hydropower Project) below, respectfully seeking your corrections:

(One)
	The Xin'an River rises, fish leap,
	The Xin'an River spills, a silver river falls.
		The giant dam relies on management,
		The high mountains seem to shout.
		…………
		Jade dragons fly like silk,
		Everywhere, wheels turn generating electricity.
		Thousands of heavenly horses,
		Gallop through ten thousand valleys of clouds.

(Two)
	Mountains by the Xin'an River are like dark green,
	Rippling water and rocks, the wind whistles through the rapids.
		Fish and birds are at ease,
		A small boat in a clear mirror.
		…………
		Echoes answer from the cliffs,
		Huguang is comparable to the Three Gorges.
		Faintly hearing thunder,
		Fragrant blossoms bloom for a thousand miles.

(Three)
	Xin'an electricity nurtures blessings for the Southeast,
	Unveiling a brocade and embroidery flower valley.
		The sound of roosters crows among the looms,
		Peach Blossom Spring is quiet and full of sound.
		…………
		Light descends on ten thousand houses,
		People dance and sing with joy.
		Drinking the water, thinking of today,
		Subduing the dragon required sweat and toil.

    菩萨蛮三首（歌颂新安江水电工程）
    我这几年来，学习了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话后，知道文艺工作上第一为政治性，其次则为艺术性。刚刚逢到我国各方进步一日千里，我于欢欣鼓舞中，每年常有一些旧体诗来歌咏新事物。
    现在我在这方面，也想跃进一下。不揣固陋，我自想：“四十学诗，迄未有成；现在七十学词！”最近确也学制了若干首。兹附录菩萨蛮三首（歌咏新安江水电工程）于下，敬求教正：
                （其一）
    新安水涨游鱼跃，新安水泻银河落。
        巨坝仗经营，高山邪许声。
        …………
        玉龙飞匹练，触处轮翻电。
        天马百千群，奔腾万壑云。
                  （其二）
    新安江上山如黛，粼粼水石风鸣濑。
        鱼鸟与从容，扁舟明镜中。
        …………
        岩回声自答，湖广齐高峡。
        隐隐闻雷鸣，芳华千里生。
                （其三）
    新安电孕东南福，开张锦绣繁花谷。
        机杼间鸡鸣，桃源静有声。
        …………
        光明临万屋，歌舞人间乐。
        饮水想今朝，驯龙汗马劳。
