    Red Flag County – Jianhe

    Jianhe County is one of the counties where the Miao people of Guizhou Province live in concentrated communities. The county has a population of 180,000, of which more than 70% are Miao. Jianhe County is located on the edge of the Leigong Mountain, the main peak of the Miao Mountains. Here, peaks rise and fall, and the mountains are majestic. Between the rolling peaks, countless rivers and streams flow, and the famous Qingshui River runs through the entire territory.

    Before liberation, Jianhe County was the most backward area in Guizhou Province. After liberation, although its economy and culture have undergone great changes, it has not been able to quickly change its original backwardness due to its poor foundation.

    The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959 made the always-backward Jianhe leap to become a Red Flag County in the province, becoming a symbol of the province's leap forward.

    Although treasures are everywhere in the mountains, from liberation to 1957, only a few million catties of grain and 50,000 cubic meters of wood were purchased by the state each year, and other mountain products and specialties sold to the state were only worth about 10,000 yuan. But it had to buy a lot of things from outside. Although it is rich in wood and bamboo, simple woodenware, bamboo ware, and even bamboo chopsticks had to be transported from Hongjiang, Hunan. In order to help the development of the economy and culture of the minority areas, the state's financial subsidies and social relief to this place are around one million yuan every year.

    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the broad masses and cadres of Jianhe County greatly broke the theory that the region was backward and the minority nationalities were backward, and they aroused revolutionary enthusiasm and strived for the upper reaches in socialist construction. In 1958, the total grain output increased by 88.16% compared with 1957, the total industrial output value was more than five times that of 1957, the number of schools increased by more than double that of 1957, the number of students increased by nearly one and a half times, and medical equipment also increased several times. Since liberation, Jianhe County has solved the situation of being unable to make ends meet for the first time. Not only did it not require state subsidies this year, but it also turned over more than 400,000 yuan to the state. The continued leap forward in 1959 made Jianhe County a rich county. In agricultural production, it removed the low-yield label and became a thousand-cattie rice county. The yield of rice per mu was more than 1,300 catties, and the total grain output reached more than 410 million catties, an increase of 75.6% compared with 1958. After deducting grain rations, 1,400 catties of reserve grain per person, as well as seeds and feed, more than 25.65 million catties of grain were sold to the state. The vigorous "small autumn harvest" movement made the county richer and added to its splendor. In just over twenty days after the autumn harvest, the county collected more than 700 million catties of tung seeds, tea seeds, quercus seeds, medicinal materials, etc. With the bumper harvest of mountain products, a processing movement of "one pot per household, one factory per three households" was launched, processing more than 100 million catties of starch, tannin extract, alkali, edible oil, mixed oil, sugar, pastries, etc. The commercial sector alone purchased mountain products and specialties and processed products (excluding grain, wood, and industrial products) worth 30.56 million yuan, an average of 170 yuan per person in the county. In addition, in 1959, the county also supported the state with 100,000 cubic meters of the best construction timber – Miao Mountain Fir. In the early days of liberation, 200 bolts of cloth were shipped in a year, but they could not be sold. In 1959, the sales volume of cotton cloth reached more than 30,000 bolts. The sales volume of other items such as sneakers, pens, and flashlights has increased by tens to thousands of times. In the past, the daily necessities and production tools of the people of Jianhe County were all bought from other places. Now, daily necessities such as rice pots, rice bowls, bamboo hats, umbrellas, soap, paper, sweets and pastries can not only be produced by themselves to meet the needs of the county, but also support neighboring counties. In the past, even hoes and sickles were transported from other places. Now, more complex agricultural tools such as deep plows, double-wheeled double-furrow plows, water pumps, threshing machines, and hulling machines can be manufactured. (Zhang Zhilin)

    红旗县——剑河
    剑河县是贵州省苗族人民聚居的县份之一，全县十八万人口，70％以上是苗族。剑河县地处苗岭主峰雷公山的边沿。这里峰峦起伏，山势雄伟。在绵延起伏的群峰之间，奔流着无数条河流小溪，著名的清水江横贯全境。
    剑河县在解放前是贵州省最落后的地区。解放以后，这里的经济文化虽然都有很大变化，但由于它基础太差，仍然没有能够很快改变原有的落后面貌。
    1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，使一向落后的剑河跃居为全省的红旗县，成为全省跃进的标志。
    这里虽然遍山是宝，但从解放到1957年每年供国家收购的只是几百万斤粮食和五万立方米的木材，其他山货特产出售给国家的只不过万元左右。而这里却要向外边购买很多东西。这里虽盛产木材、竹子，而简单的木器、竹器、甚至竹筷子都得从湖南洪江运来。国家为了帮助少数民族地区经济和文化事业的发展，每年给这里的财政补助和社会救济都在百万元上下。
    1958年大跃进中，剑河县广大群众和干部大破地区落后论、少数民族落后论，鼓起革命干劲，在社会主义建设中争得了上游，1958年粮食总产量比1957年增长88.16％，工业总产值等于1957年五倍多，学校比1957年增加一倍多，学生增加了近一倍半，医疗设备等也成倍的增加。解放以来，剑河县第一次解决了入不敷出的情况，这一年不仅没有要国家补助，而且还上缴给国家四十多万元。1959年的继续跃进，更使剑河县一跃而为富县。在农业生产上摘掉了低产帽子，成为水稻千斤县。水稻亩产一千三百多斤，粮食总产量达四亿一千多万斤，比1958年增长75.6％，全县每人除留口粮和储备粮一千四百斤以及种子、饲料以外，缴售给国家的粮食达二千五百六十五万多斤。轰轰烈烈的“小秋收”运动，更使这个县富上加富，锦上添花。仅是秋收后的二十多天，全县就采了桐集子、茶子、青杠子、药材等七亿多斤，随着山货的大丰收，又掀起了一户一锅，三户一厂的加工运动，加工出淀粉、栲胶、土碱、食油、混合油、糖、糕点等一亿多斤。仅商业部门在这里收购山货特产及加工品，（不包括粮食、木材与工业产品）价值三千零五十六万元，全县每人平均一百七十元。另外，1959年这个县还支援给国家十万立方米最好建筑木材——苗岭杉。解放初期，这里一年运进二百匹布，还卖不出去，而1959年棉布销售量达三万多匹。其他如球鞋、钢笔、手电等的销售量，都增长了数十倍至几千倍，过去剑河县人民生活上的日常用品和生产工具，都是从外地买来的，现在日常生活用品，如饭锅、饭碗、斗笠、雨伞、肥皂、纸张、糖果糕点等不仅能自己生产，满足本县供应，而且还能支援邻县。过去这里连锄头、镰刀都是从外地运进来的，现在已能制造深耕犁、双轮双铧犁、抽水机、打谷机和脱粒机等较复杂的农具。	　（张之遴）
