Great Battle on Mang Mountain to Conquer the Drought Demon
By Our Correspondent Zhāng Lìzhōng

South of the Yellow River, in Mengjin County on the Mang Mountain Ridge in western Henan, red flags are flying between the rolling loess hills, and well frames stand tall. Many newly drilled machine wells are already pumping water out with boiler engines, irrigating the green wheat fields all over the mountains.

The people of Mengjin County, in Mang Mountain Ridge, known for its drought, find it very novel to be able to irrigate the land with well water. Wei Nai, the Secretary of the CPC Mengjin County Committee, said excitedly: "Drought is originally a bad thing, but now it has turned into a good thing. You see, it has forced us from the situation of carrying water to fight drought with pots and cans, to a new stage of 'machine wells on Mang Mountain, bumper harvests do not depend on the heavens.' Our waist is getting stronger and stronger in fighting drought."

Mang Mountain in western Henan, close to the south bank of the Yellow River, is a range of loess hills, stretching about four hundred miles from east to west. Mengjin County is located on the Mang Mountain Ridge, with dozens of miles of loess highlands from north to south, reaching an altitude of six hundred to eight hundred meters above sea level. Although there is the Yellow River to the north and the Luo River to the south, the terrain is too high, and they can only watch the river flow day and night, without solving the drought problem of Mang Mountain farmland. Therefore, the drought of Mang Mountain is famous, and the local people call it the "Fire Dragon Ridge". In the past, the people of Mang Mountain fought against nature and dug wells, but because the terrain was high and the groundwater level was very low, either they could not get water, or there was water in the deep layers, but because the sand could not form a wellbore, they finally failed. This is the situation of Mang Mountain for thousands of years. Taking Mengjin County as an example, 87% of the county's cultivated land is on the Mang Mountain Ridge. Before liberation, some villages had to travel several miles to fetch water, let alone irrigate the land. After liberation, the Party led the people of the county to build water conservancy projects, built some small reservoirs, and dug many water cellars and ponds, and the situation changed. However, these water conservancy projects all depend on rain to store water! Last summer, autumn, winter, and this spring, Henan has been in a long-term drought with little rain and snow, and many small reservoirs and ponds were used up during the drought resistance last year.

The drought is sharply testing the people's will to build socialism. The Party and the people of Mengjin County are determined to take out the groundwater of Mang Mountain, overcome the drought of Mang Mountain, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Han Zhenxuan, a member of the Communist Party of Hengshui People's Commune in Mengjin County, and others, are socialist "pioneers" who took the lead in drilling machine wells on Mang Mountain. They are a group of people who will never bow their heads in the face of difficulties. For the sake of socialism, no matter what kind of difficulties they must overcome!

The fact that well drilling had failed thousands of times in history made people believe that well drilling was impossible in the Mang Mountain area. When the Mengjin County Committee called on the people to drill wells to fight drought, it first encountered such a superstition. How to break this superstition became the primary key to carrying out the well-drilling movement. The Party called on the people to break this superstition, and transported water pumps and boiler engines to Mang Mountain, and organized the people's communes to drill machine wells on a large scale. Only a little over a month after the well-drilling movement was officially launched, the county had already drilled 444 machine wells, which could expand the irrigation area by more than 90,000 mu, which is about equal to the county's original irrigated land area. Now, 334 machine wells have been used to draw water for irrigation, irrigating more than 58,000 mu of cultivated land.

Recently, this reporter visited the first well drilled in Mengjin County, the No. 1 Mang Mountain Machine Well, built by the Hanliang Brigade of the Hengshui Commune. We met Han Zhenxuan, the leader of the well-drilling team that built this well, on the well platform. When the County Party Secretary introduced him, he said: "Han Zhenxuan is the embodiment of the spirit of the people of Mang Mountain, the representative of the Mang Mountain spirit."

Han Zhenxuan told us the story of well drilling after a tortuous struggle: Since 1957, he had vowed to drill wells on Mang Mountain to obtain water. At that time, people happily called his well-drilling team the "treasure-hunting team". However, the first time they drilled more than ten yards deep, they encountered a permeable layer, and all the water they pumped out leaked out. Later, they changed the location and re-drilled. It was difficult to get water, and the wellbore was built, but because the soil quality in the deep layer was not good, the wellbore collapsed as soon as it was built. Although that well-drilling exploration work was not successful, it proved that there was water under Mang Mountain, breaking the first superstition of the people.

This year, they encountered drought again, and Branch Secretary Gao Qing and Han Zhenxuan thought of drilling wells again, determined to try again and compete with the heavens. Their ambition was supported by the Secretary of the County Party Committee, and a well-drilling team composed of five Party members and twenty Youth League members was formed. This time, they learned from the past failures and first visited the old farmers to investigate the groundwater situation. Meng Qizi, who had been a hired hand for more than forty years, told them: Forty years ago, he dug a water well with particularly strong water. According to his own personal experience, there is not only water under Mang Mountain, but also a lot of water, which can be used to drill wells.

According to Meng Qizi's guidance, the well-drilling team selected a place where the two sides were high and the terrain in the middle was slightly low, and began to drill the first well. They were determined: Even if they drilled through the ground, they would get water. The responsible comrades of the County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committee also encouraged them: "The people of the whole county and the whole commune are watching you. This well can only succeed, not fail." The young men of the well-drilling team were really enthusiastic. They didn't want to rest as soon as they started, and they got water at a depth of five yards. Not only was there water, but the water was also strong.

However, because the water was strong, the well wall was soaked in water, and large pieces collapsed. After research, they decided to simply expand the wellhead from one yard to two yards and three feet, making it large at the top and small at the bottom to avoid collapse. The team members pointed to the wellhead and said with a smile: "Let's see if you can collapse into a lake? Even if it collapses into a lake, we must build it." Using this method, they finally built the wellbore and completed the first machine well on Mang Mountain.

The inexhaustible spring water of the No. 1 machine well washed away the old concept that Mang Mountain had no water source for thousands of years and boosted people's confidence in transforming Mang Mountain. Mengjin County immediately launched a large-scale well-drilling campaign. Within five days, 520 wells were started in the county. In Zhangpan Village of Haizi Commune, where the Zhangpan Brigade is located, there is a Temple of Yu the Great. This time, when they made an overall plan to drill machine wells, one of the wells happened to be under the seat of Yu the Great. The commune members moved down the statue of Yu the Great and quickly drilled a machine well under the seat. They said that the Temple of Yu the Great, which had been useless for thousands of years, has now truly become a Crystal Palace. In the climax of well drilling, the Hanshui Production Team, which is located on the ridge of Mang Mountain, had only twenty laborers in the entire team, and they ordered a plan to drill three machine wells, and even the cook, the feeder, and all those who could work went into battle. Once the pain of drought for thousands of years was relieved, some commune members couldn't help but shout to the sky: Drought! We now have plenty of water.

Now the people's communes in Mengjin County are still continuing to build new wells, and the speed of well drilling has accelerated. The No. 1 machine well took more than fifty days to drill. Now it takes only about fifteen days to drill a well of the same depth and size. In the climax, the well-drilling weapon rocket cone also went to Mang Mountain. However, after a few days of hard work, the people of Mengjin County improved the rocket cone and made a spiral cone suitable for the soil of Mang Mountain, which increased the speed of well drilling from three feet per day to one foot and two feet per day. Those people who used to believe that Mang Mountain was a "Fire Dragon Ridge" and that drilling wells on Mang Mountain was a delusion have now become active supporters and participants in the machine well drilling campaign. Facing the well frames and red flags all over the mountains, they say convinced: "After all, the leadership of the Communist Party is good, the strength of the masses is great, and where the red flag is inserted, water will definitely be produced!" Steel-like will and endless wisdom have become an indestructible force. Zhangpan Brigade of Haizi Commune is the place where the underground water source is the weakest. No matter how deep they drill, the water volume is very small. This time, when drilling machine wells, people horizontally dug three cave dwellings under the well to increase the area of water inflow. In this way, a water pump could not dry it out all day long. Matun Commune also connected seven small wells with underground channels to form an underground river network.

After the wells are drilled, canals must be opened for irrigation. The Mang Mountain is interlaced with gullies and ridges, and the terrain is complex. People also used the perseverance of drilling wells, the perseverance of building large-scale underground river networks, building bridges across gullies, leading water up the mountains, and building the Mang Mountain machine well irrigation network. This reporter visited a mountain canal called "Water Margin", which meanders in the most difficult mountain to irrigate. Several water pumps relay the water and lead it all the way to the top of the mountain.

Now, the wheat fields in Mengjin County have been irrigated by the newly drilled machine wells, and the land for spring sowing has also been irrigated. The green wheat seedlings all over the mountains and fields are growing better than in any previous year. The uneven land for many years is now flat and tidy layer by layer, and the freshly watered loose soil is full of tempting fragrance everywhere. Now the commune members of various communes are nervously sending topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields and transporting base fertilizer to the spring sowing land. Along with the victorious development of the machine well drilling movement, many communes and brigades are brewing revisions to the production increase targets, intensifying measures, and determined to answer this year's severe drought with greater harvests.

    大战邙山降旱魔
    本报记者　张励中
    黄河南岸，豫西邙山岭上的孟津县，在那起伏的黄土山岗之间，红旗招展，井架矗立，许多新打成的机井，已经用锅驼机轰隆轰隆地抽出水来，灌溉着满山遍野青青的麦田。
    素以干旱著称的邙山岭上终于能够用井水浇地，孟津县的人民都认为这是很新奇的事。中共孟津县委书记卫乃如同志激动地说：“干旱本来是坏事，但是现在却变成了好事。你看，它已经逼迫我们从盆盆罐罐齐上阵来运水抗旱的情况，走上了‘机井上邙山，丰收不靠天’的新阶段。我们抗旱的腰杆越抗越硬了。”
    豫西紧靠黄河南岸的邙山，是一带黄土山岭，东西绵亘约四百里。孟津县就在邙山岭上，南北几十里的黄土高地，拔海达六百米到八百米。尽管北面有黄河，南面有洛河，但是地势太高，眼睁睁望着河水日夜奔流，却解决不了邙山农田的干旱问题。因此邙山的干旱出了名，当地人民把它叫做“火龙岗”。过去邙山人民同自然斗争，也打过井，但因地势高亢，地下水位很低，不是打不出水来，就是深层有水，因沙土砌不成井筒，终于失败。这就是千百年来邙山的情况。拿孟津县来说，全县87％的耕地在邙山岭上，解放前，有些村庄吃水都要跑几里路去挑，当然更谈不上用水浇地了。解放后，党领导全县人民兴修水利，修起了一些小水库，挖了很多水窖和池塘，情况有了改变。但是，这些水利工程都要靠下雨才有水可蓄啊！去年夏、秋、冬和今年春天，河南长期干旱，雨雪稀少，许多小水库和池塘在去年抗旱的时候就用干了。
    干旱尖锐地考验着人们建设社会主义的意志。孟津县的党和人民，决心取出邙山的地下水来，克服邙山的干旱，争取今年农业丰产。孟津县横水人民公社社员，共产党员韩振轩等，就是在邙山上带头打成机井的社会主义“闯将”。他们是一批永远不会在困难前面低头的人。为了社会主义，不管甚么样的困难他们都要闯过去！
    历史上千百次打井失败的事实，竟使人们认为邙山地区根本不能打井。孟津县委号召人民打井抗旱，首先就遇到了这样一个迷信。怎样打破这个迷信，就成了开展打井运动的首要关键。党号召人民打破这个迷信，并且把抽水机和锅驼机等运上了邙山，组织各人民公社大打机井。打井运动正式展开才一个多月，全县已经打成机井四百四十四眼，可以扩大灌溉面积九万多亩，约等于全县原有的水浇地面积；现在已有三百三十四眼机井提水浇地，灌溉着五万八千多亩耕地。
    最近记者参观了横水公社寒亮大队打成的孟津县的第一眼井——邙山第一号机井，我们在井台上遇见了建设这眼机井的打井队队长韩振轩。县委书记在介绍的时候说：“韩振轩就是邙山人民干劲的化身，邙山精神的代表者。”
    韩振轩向我们谈起经过曲折斗争的打井故事：从1957年起，他就立志一定要在邙山上打井取水，当时人们都高兴地称他领导的打井队是“取宝队”。可是，第一次他们钻了十来丈深，遇到了透水层，打出的水全漏干了。后来又易地重打，好容易打出了水，并且砌好了井筒，可是由于深层土质不好，刚砌好井筒就塌了。那一次打井的试探工作虽然没有成功，却证明邙山下面有水，打破了人们的第一个迷信。
    今年又遇到了干旱，支部书记高庆和韩振轩又想起打井的事，决心要再次试探，和老天比高低。他们的雄心得到了县委书记的支持，组成了一个有五个党员、二十个团员参加的打井班。这次他们接受过去失败的教训，首先分头访问老农，调查地下水的情况。扛过四十多年长工的孟七子告诉他们：四十年前他挖过一眼水井，水特别旺。根据他自己的亲身经验看，邙山山下不但有水，而且水多，可以打井。
    打井班根据孟七子的指导，选择了一个两边高、中间地势稍微低洼一点的地方，开始打第一眼井。他们立定决心：那怕把地打穿也要打出水来。县委和公社党委的负责同志也鼓励他们说：“全县和全社的人民都在看着你们，这眼井只能成功，不能失败。”打井班的小伙子们真是干劲冲天，他们一动手就不肯歇，打到五丈深出了水。不但有水，而且水旺。
    可是因为水旺，井帮经水浸泡，却一大片一大片地往下塌。经过研究，他们决定干脆把井口扩大，从一丈扩大到两丈三，上大下小，避免下塌。队员们指着井口笑着说：“看你能塌成湖不能？塌成湖也一定要打成。”他们用这个办法，终于砌成了井筒，打成了邙山上的第一眼机井。
    第一号机井的不竭泉水，冲走了千年邙山无水源的旧观念，鼓舞了人们改造邙山的信心。孟津县立即展开了大打机井的运动。全县五天之间就有五百二十多眼井破土动工。海资公社獐?大队所在的村里有一座禹王庙。这次他们全面规划打机井时，有一眼井正好在禹王的神座下。社员们就搬倒了禹王像，很快就在神座下面打成了一眼机井。他们说，千年无用的禹王庙，今天真正变成了水晶宫。在打井的高潮中，处于邙山脊上的寒水生产队，全队只有二十个劳动力，就订了打三眼机井的计划，连炊事员、饲养员和所有能劳动的人都上了阵。千百年来干旱的痛苦一旦解除，有的社员情不自禁地对天大喊：你旱吧！我们现在有的是水。
    现在孟津县各人民公社还在继续建新井，打井速度加快了。第一号机井打了五十多天，现在打同样深、同样大的井只需十五天左右就行了。高潮中，打井利器火箭锥也上了邙山。可是，孟津县的人们经过几天的苦战，又改进火箭锥，制成了一种适合于邙山土质的螺旋锥，把打井的速度由日进三尺提高到日进一丈二尺。那些过去曾经迷信邙山是“火龙岗”，认为在邙山上打井是妄想的人们，现在已经变成了打机井运动的积极拥护者和参加者，他们面对着满山遍野的井架和红旗，口服心服地说：“到底是共产党的领导好，群众的力量大，红旗往哪里插，哪里就一定能打出水来！”钢铁般的意志和无尽的智慧已经变成了无坚不摧的力量。海资公社獐?大队是地下水源最不旺的地方，不管打多深，水量都很少。这次打机井，人们在井下又横挖了三个窑洞，使来水的面积增加，这样，一部抽水机整天抽也抽不干了。麻屯公社还把七眼小井用地下渠道沟通在一起，形成了地下河网。
    井打成了，还要开渠才能灌溉。邙山上沟岗交错，地形复杂。人们同样用打井的毅力，用大搞地下河网的毅力，隔沟搭桥，引水上山，建设了邙山的机井灌溉网。记者参观过一条叫做“水浒传”的转山渠，它蜿蜒在最难浇的山地上，几部抽水机接力抽水，一直把水引上了山顶。
    现在，孟津县的麦田获得了新打的机井的灌溉，准备春播的地也获得了灌溉。满山遍野绿油油的麦苗，长得比以往任何一年都好。多年来高低不平的土地，现在一层一层平平整整，刚刚浇过的松软的泥土，到处都散放着诱人的香味。现在各公社的社员们都在紧张地向麦田送追肥，向春播地运底肥。不少公社和大队，伴随着打机井运动的胜利开展，都在酝酿修订增产指标，措施加码，决心要以更大的丰收来回答今年的严重干旱。
