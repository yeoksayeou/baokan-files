Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent telegrams to trade union organizations in some Asian and African countries and regions, warmly congratulating the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

In telegrams sent to the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the General Federation of Iraqi Trade Unions, it stated, "On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, let us work together to strengthen Afro-Asian unity, oppose the policy of the imperialists headed by the United States in creating tension in the Afro-Asian region and intensifying their plans for aggression and war, and eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism."

In telegrams sent to the Moroccan Labour Union, the General Union of Algerian Workers, the General Union of Black African Workers, the National Confederation of Workers of Guinea, the General Labour Confederation of Cameroon, the Mali Trade Union Federation, the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the Nigeria Trade Union Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions, and the Nyasaland Trade Union Congress, it stated, "In the long and arduous struggle of the African people against imperialism, they have the sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the support of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world. The day when imperialism and the colonial system are finally buried is not far off."

In telegrams sent to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Liaison Council of Neutral Trade Unions, it stated, "The struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has formed an unprecedentedly broad mass movement. U.S. imperialism and its servant, Japanese militarism, have suffered a serious blow and have become more isolated. Chinese workers pledge to work with the Japanese people to redouble our efforts to safeguard Afro-Asian unity and world peace, and to thoroughly defeat the imperialists' instigation and war conspiracies."

In telegrams sent to the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, and the United Trade Union Congress (Chakravarti faction), it stated, "The Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have laid the foundation for friendly unity among the people of Asia and Africa. The recent signing of the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese agreements, as well as the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers, have once again dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists' conspiracy to split Afro-Asian unity. We firmly believe that the Bandung spirit will continue to shine even brighter, and the friendly unity between the peoples and workers of Asia and Africa will develop even further."

In telegrams sent to the All-Pakistan Confederation of Labour, the Ceylon Federation of Labour, the Ceylon Independent Mercantile Union, the Ceylon Trade Union Council, the Ceylon Democratic Workers' Congress, the Ceylon Workers' Congress, the Ceylon Labour Federation, the Ceylon National Teachers' Union, the Burmese Trade Union Congress, the All-Burma Trade Union Federation, the All-Indonesia Central Labor Organization, the Indonesian Democratic Labor Union, the Muslim Labor Union, the Central Cooperation Conference of Government Employee Organizations, the Foreign Enterprise Cooperation Conference, the Indonesian Village Public Office Staff Union, the Malayan Trades Union Congress, and the Singapore Trades Union Congress, it stated that Chinese workers pledge to work with the workers of these countries to redouble our efforts to safeguard Afro-Asian and world peace, and to thoroughly defeat all the conspiracies of imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: On the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference and "Anti-Colonialism Day," the All-China Women's Federation sent telegrams to the Democratic Women's League of Cameroon, the Algerian Women's Union, the West African Women's Union, the Women's Department of the Uganda National Congress Party, and the Women's Department of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, extending sincere respect to the women and people of these countries and regions, and wishing them more brilliant achievements and major victories in their struggle for national independence and freedom.

The telegrams stated that, inspired by the Bandung spirit, the struggle of the Afro-Asian people against imperialism and colonialism has converged into a historical torrent, surging forward irresistibly. Now, the dawn is rising on the African continent, and imperialism is at its last gasp. Under this excellent situation, let the Afro-Asian people and women strengthen their unity even more, advance victoriously, and persist in the struggle for the final burial of imperialism and colonialism, and for the progress of mankind and the happiness of women and children, until the final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 17th: Newspapers here reported today that Premier Pham Van Dong sent telegrams to the Prime Ministers of India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Pakistan on the 16th to congratulate them on the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

The telegram stated that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has continued to develop in the past five years and has had an increasingly profound impact on international relations, the struggle of Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence, and has played an important role in easing international tensions. Many countries have achieved independence. The peoples of Asia and Africa are closely united and have successively defeated the imperialist conspiracies of aggression and division.

The telegram stated that the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently adhered to the spirit of the Bandung Conference and stand in solidarity with the governments and peoples of Asia and Africa in the struggle against colonialist aggression and for strengthening friendly cooperation among all nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 17th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang gathered tonight to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

Li Ki-yong, member of the World Peace Council, member of the Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and famous writer, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Afro-Asian people. He emphasized that we must not sit idly by and watch the recent actions of U.S. imperialism in intensifying tensions and engaging in adventurous provocations in the Afro-Asian region.

Li Ki-yong described a series of victories achieved by the Afro-Asian people in their struggle for national independence and against imperialist aggression over the past five years, and praised the heroic struggles of the Algerian people and the African people against imperialism. He said that all facts show that the imperialists' warships, tanks, and artillery can no longer frighten the Afro-Asian people. Imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger.

Li Ki-yong said that the holding of the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference will make new contributions to strengthening the unity of the Afro-Asian people and defending world peace.

Li Ki-yong emphasized that the recent signing of the agreements on border issues and other friendly cooperation treaties between China and Burma and between China and Nepal is a new example of friendly unity among Asian and African countries, and also a great victory for the principle of peaceful coexistence. At the same time, it is a heavy blow to the imperialists who are desperately spreading discord among Asian and African countries.

He said that the Korean people will continue to strengthen the struggle to drive the American aggressor troops out of South Korea and to peacefully unify the fatherland, and will further support the struggle of the Afro-Asian people for national independence.

Li Kuk-ro, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Kim Chun-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, and Park Kwang-seon, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, all attended today's gathering.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 17th: The Soviet "Izvestia" newspaper today published an article commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

The "Izvestia" article said that the Bandung Conference showed the strong unity of the Afro-Asian people in the struggle to destroy the colonial system. Inspired by the Bandung spirit, the Afro-Asian people launched a resolute offensive against the decadent colonial system. Great changes have taken place on these two continents in the past five years. Some formerly oppressed Asian people are building a new life, and the African continent is seething.

The article said that imperialists are looking for new forms to enslave countries that have already gained independence. Western countries have used all means to prevent the Afro-Asian people from uniting around the Bandung spirit. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization military blocs, with U.S. imperialism playing the main role, are carrying out various provocative activities.

The article pointed out that the Westerners' claim that the Bandung spirit has weakened is completely nonsense. The article said that the recent Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference once again showed that the Asian and African countries have raised even higher the torch lit by the Bandung Conference.

    苏联报纸发表纪念文章
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联“消息报”今天发表文章纪念万隆会议五周年。
    “消息报”的文章说，万隆会议显示了亚非人民在摧毁殖民主义体系的斗争中强有力的团结。在万隆思想的鼓舞下，亚非人民向腐朽的殖民主义体系展开了坚决的进攻。五年来，在这两个大陆上发生了巨大的变化。一些从前被压迫的亚洲人民正在建设新生活，非洲大陆正在沸腾。
    文章说，帝国主义者正在寻找新的形式来奴役已经取得独立的国家。西方国家使用了全部手段来阻止亚非人民团结在万隆思想的周围。由美帝国主义扮演主要角色的东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织军事集团正大肆进行各种挑衅活动。
    文章指出，西方人士胡说万隆精神已经削弱，这完全是无稽之谈。文章说，最近召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会再一次表明：亚非各国更高地举起了万隆会议点燃的火把。
