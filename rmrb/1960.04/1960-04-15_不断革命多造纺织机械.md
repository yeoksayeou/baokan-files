Workers' slogan: Guarantee increased production and double it again, without increasing personnel but even reducing them.
Technicians' slogan: Finish a day's work in half a day, spend half a day working in the workshop.
Representative Qian Jiaguang talks about the technical revolution movement at Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory

Chairman, fellow representatives:
I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Final State Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on achieving the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
After listening to the reports, we have further broadened our horizons, recognized the current excellent situation and the glorious but arduous tasks ahead, and looked forward to a happy future with full confidence. We will resolutely implement the tasks pointed out in the report in our practical work after returning.
Now, I would like to report to the conference on the situation of technical innovation and technical revolution in Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory.

With a good technical revolution, the first month is red,
The second month surpasses, and the third month is even higher than the second.

Our Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory is an old factory, mainly producing textile machinery, and jointly undertakes the construction task of the national textile industry with other brother textile machinery factories. Our factory, like the rest of the country, is in a very good situation. Last year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the provincial and municipal Party committees, all our employees conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and carried out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the core. Therefore, following the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we achieved the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. The total output value in 1959 increased by 35.7% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the product output increased by 38.9% compared with 1958, creating favorable conditions for a greater continuous leap forward in 1960.

In order to further meet the growing needs of the people, since the beginning of 1960, the Party has asked us to produce more and better products. According to the Party's instructions, all our employees have initially planned to increase the production of spinning machines by 1.2 times compared with the actual production last year. However, after calculation, it is still necessary to increase more than 500 technicians and some necessary machine tool equipment. Under this situation, all employees put forward the instruction of increasing production without increasing personnel, put forward by the Party, and put forward the slogan: "Technical revolution turns the world upside down, guarantee production and double it again, master the three magic weapons, reduce personnel without increasing them." All employees held higher the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and marched towards the broad road of technical innovation and technical revolution, launching a battle to seek labor from technical revolution and increase production from technical revolution. The actions of all employees were as rapid as a storm, and the technical revolution movement quickly swept the entire factory. The first battle was a great success. After four days and nights of hard work, all employees realized four automatic production lines, twenty-five single-machine automation, and thirty-one mechanization and cutting-edge projects. After the realization of the two automatic production lines for screws and nuts, it is initially estimated that it can save 15 workers and 3 milling machines, and improve efficiency by more than one time. The victory of this battle further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of all our employees and strengthened our confidence and determination to vigorously carry out the technical revolution. Subsequently, the workers in the foundry workshop put forward the slogan "Technical revolution turns the world upside down, the production outlook is greatly changed, all mechanization on July 1st, offer a gift for the Party's birthday." After three days and nights of hard work by workers, leading cadres, and engineering and technical personnel, a fully automated program-controlled sand mixing system was realized, turning the dirty and tiring operation in the past into an automatic operation as long as a button is pressed. Semi-automatic iron water transport carts were also realized. When the carts are walking automatically, if the workers accidentally touch them, the carts will automatically stop immediately. Many workers praised the Party and Chairman Mao as being better than their parents, always thinking of the people, sweeping away heavy physical labor, greatly changing the hygienic environment, and making the production leap forward shine.

The mass technical revolution movement is not only manifested in production technology, but also in management, life, and other aspects. In order to improve efficiency and achieve "finishing half a day's work in a day, spending half a day working in the workshop," management personnel also created calculation instruments such as calculating wages and calculating materials in their struggles. Under the vigorous cooperation of the workers in the workshop, the canteen workers made mechanized equipment such as dishwashers, dumpling machines, vegetable cutting machines, and rice washing machines. Such a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has been carried out in an all-round and vigorous manner. It has made production rise linearly, and a new situation of continuous great leap forward in production has emerged, with the first month being red, the second month surpassing, and the third month being even higher than the second month. The first quarter's product output plan was completed six days ahead of schedule, an increase of 5.7 times over the same period last year, and the first quarter's output value plan was completed four days ahead of schedule, an increase of 80% over the same period last year, ensuring the "red start to the quarter."

Great ideological liberation, overcoming difficulties,
attacking cutting-edge technology, creating miracles

In the technical revolution movement, with the high-speed development of production, the mental outlook of all employees in our factory has also undergone profound changes. All employees have further liberated their minds, established the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, overcome difficulties, attacked cutting-edge technology, and created miracles. In order to realize the automatic production line, the workers in the screw workshop proposed to turn rest days into leap forward days, use holidays to learn advanced experiences from brother factories in the suburbs, and use holidays and after-work hours to work hard to achieve breakthroughs. In the process of realization, all employees further developed the spirit of mutual cooperation. If one person has difficulties, everyone comes to help; they vigorously carry out innovation themselves, and at the same time actively help others innovate. Most of the innovation proposals in our factory are thought out by one or a few people, and then everyone starts to work together. For example, when we transformed the machine tool for manufacturing steel collars into single-machine automation, a group of people all went out together after work to work together, and as a result, it was quickly manufactured successfully.

Through vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, the close unity between employees has been further strengthened. In the past, some engineering and technical personnel had less contact with workers. Therefore, the technical revolution has greatly educated the engineering and technical personnel, and they have gone deep into the workshops to fight together with the workers, which has further developed the "three-way combination" system, so that the key point of boring that had not been solved for a long time has been quickly solved. The successful five-eye automatic boring machine has increased efficiency by more than four times. High-speed steel and waste cutting tools and small pieces of high-speed steel were melted together with an electric welding machine to make new cutting tools, and the quality of the steel was guaranteed, saving high-speed steel for the country and promoting the high-speed development of production.

This communist spirit of the working class has promoted the forward development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

The technical revolution movement in our factory is being carried out under the leadership of the Party, with the gradual clarification of our thinking. At the beginning, we mainly aimed at the weak links in production and the missing equipment, relying on our own efforts, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods if possible, and using indigenous methods if not possible, and vigorously carrying out raw material production and self-made equipment. Our slogan is: "Self-reliance, don't be a hand-stretcher." We made our own ferrosilicon electric furnace to refine ferrosilicon without ferrosilicon, and we refined our own coke without coke. By widely mobilizing the employees through indigenous methods, we have manufactured 149 units of four-axis gantry milling machines, four-head linked milling machines, five-head boring machines, eight-head drilling machines, etc. since last year, and the efficiency has been increased by one to four times respectively. In order to adapt to the high-speed development of production and achieve increased production without increasing personnel, we have also vigorously carried out program control and modular machine tools according to the characteristics of our factory's large number of parts, and on this basis, we have taken it to a higher level, marched towards automation, and vigorously carried out semi-automation and automation.

After achieving victory in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, all employees in our factory have become more enthusiastic. We deeply feel that the Party's general line for socialist construction is completely correct, and the victory we have achieved is the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The practice in the first quarter proves that we will surely achieve a greater leap forward this year. Therefore, all employees in our factory guarantee that not only will they not increase personnel this year, but they will also transfer some people to support the construction of new factories. 203 technicians and cadres above the fourth grade have been transferred to support the new factories. On this basis, we will also complete the annual plan one month ahead of schedule, and strive to double the annual task.

Vigorously support agricultural technical transformation

In addition, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees, in order to accelerate agricultural technical transformation, we must also vigorously support agricultural technical transformation. At present, we have supported or are supporting XuShui, XingTang and other communes with cupola furnaces, lathes, water pumps, motors, electrical equipment, welding machines and other equipment. We also support the Hongshunli People's Commune in Tianjin with canteen mechanization equipment such as dumpling machines and dishwashers.

In order to ensure the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, under the leadership of the Party, we must further comprehensively carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously carrying out semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation, and accelerate the realization of technical transformation. We plan to realize 547 major mechanization and automation projects throughout the year, and manufacture and transform more than 510 machine tool equipment, including 177 single-machine automation units, and 46 automatic production lines and continuous lines. Before "July 1," the foundry workshop will basically become a mechanized workshop, laying a good foundation for "doing dirty work in white clothes," and the screw workshop will basically become a chip-free automated workshop.

After the above plans are realized, production efficiency will be further improved, the product output will increase by 1.5 times compared with the actual production last year, labor productivity will increase by 70%, steel can be saved by 10% to 15%, wood utilization rate will increase by more than 10%, and costs will be reduced by 22%.

In order to realize the above plan, we must further learn from the advanced experiences of brother factories. We have gained a lot after learning from the Northeast, Shanghai, Shanxi and other places this year. In the future, we must also learn from brother factories in a planned way.

In order to ensure the victorious realization of this year's plan, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the provincial and municipal Party committees, we will conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, hold higher the great banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and strive to fulfill this year's glorious and arduous tasks ahead of schedule.

    不断革命多造纺织机械
    工人的口号：保证生产再加番，人员不增还要减
    技术人员的口号：一天工作半日完，半天工作半天下车间
    钱嘉光代表谈天津纺织机械厂的技术革命运动主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，和李先念副总理
  “关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和谭震林副总理关于提前实现农业发展纲要的报告。
    听了报告以后，使我们进一步开阔了眼界，认清了当前大好形势和今后光荣而艰巨的任务，并满怀信心地展望着幸福的未来。根据报告中所指出的任务，回去以后在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我仅就天津纺织机械厂的技术革新和技术革命开展情况，向大会作一汇报。
    技术革命搞得好，一月红，
    二月超，三月更比二月高
    我们天津纺织机械厂是一个老厂，主要生产纺织机械，和各兄弟纺织机械厂共同担负着全国纺织工业的建设任务。我厂和全国一样，当前形势很好，去年我厂全体职工，在党中央、毛主席和省、市委的领导下，认真执行了党的八届八中全会决议精神，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗，开展了以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的技术革新、技术革命运动，因而，继1958年大跃进之后，取得了1959年大跃进的伟大胜利。总产值1959年比大跃进的1958年增长35.7％，产品产量比1958年增长38.9％，为1960年更大的继续跃进，创造了良好条件。
    为了进一步满足人民日益增长的需要，所以进入1960年以来，党就要我们生产出更多、更好的产品。根据党的指示，我们全体职工初步计划，今年纱机生产要比去年实际增长一点二倍。但是经过核算以后，还需要增加五百多名技术工人，和一些必要机床设备。在这种情况下，全体职工提出坚决贯彻执行党所提出来的增产不增人的指示，提出了“技术革命闹翻天，保证生产再加番，三大法宝掌握好，人员不增要减少”的口号来。全体职工更高地举起了总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗，奔向技术革新、技术革命的康庄大道，展开向技术革命要劳动力，向技术革命要增产的战斗。全体职工的行动急如风暴，技术革命运动很快席卷了全厂，第一次战役旗开得胜，全体职工经过四昼夜的奋战，就实现了自动生产线四条，单机自动二十五台，机械化及尖端项目三十一项。像螺钉、螺母两条自动生产线实现以后，初步计算即可节约十五个工人，和三台铣口机，提高效率一倍多。这一次战役的胜利，进一步鼓舞了我们全体职工的革命干劲，加强了大搞技术革命的信心和决心。随之铸工车间的工人又提出了“技术革命闹翻天，生产面貌大改观，七一全部机械化，党的生日把礼献”的口号来。经过工人、领导干部和工程技术人员奋战三昼夜，实现了完全自动化的程序控制混砂系统，把过去又脏又累的操作，变为只要一按电钮，混砂系统就自动操作起来。并且还实现了半自动化的铁水运送小车，当小车自动行走时，如果工人不注意碰上了，小车马上自动停止。很多工人歌颂党和毛主席胜爹娘，处处为咱人民想，笨重体力劳动一扫光，卫生环境大变样，生产跃进放光芒。
    群众性的技术革命运动，不仅表现在生产技术方面，而且在管理、生活等方面，也闹得热火朝天。管理人员为了提高效率，作到“一日工作半日完，半日工作半日下车间”，在奋战中也创造了计算工资、计算材料等计算仪器。食堂工人在车间工人的大力协作下，作出了洗碗机、饺子机、切菜机、洗米机等机械化设备。这样一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，全面地轰轰烈烈地开展起来。使生产直线上升，出现了一月红、二月超、三月更比二月高的生产持续大跃进的新局面。提前六天完成第一季度产品产量计划，比去年同期提高五点七倍，提前四天完成第一季度产值计划，比去年同期提高80％，保证了“首季红”。
    思想大解放，大破难关，
      大攻尖端，大创奇迹
    在大闹技术革命运动中，随着生产高速度发展，我厂全体职工的精神面貌，也发生了深刻的变化。全体职工进一步解放了思想，树立了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，大破难关，大攻尖端，大创奇迹。螺丝车间工人为了实现自动生产线，提出了把休息日变为跃进日，利用假期到郊区学习兄弟厂先进经验，利用假期和班后苦战突击实现。在实现的过程中，全体职工进一步发扬了互相协作的精神。一个人有了困难，大家都来帮助；自己大闹革新，同时还积极帮助别人革新。我厂绝大部分革新建议都是一个人或几个人想出来以后，大家动手搞起来的。像我们把制造钢领的机床改为单机自动化时，一个小组的人下班以后，全体出动，共同动手，结果很快就制造成功了。
    通过大搞技术革新、技术革命，进一步加强了职工之间的紧密团结，过去有些工程技术人员和工人联系较少，因此工人有些意见，通过大搞技术革命对工程技术人员教育很大，他们深入车间和工人共同奋战，使“三结合”制度得到进一步发展，使长期未得解决的搪孔关键得到迅速解决。制造成功的五眼自动搪孔机，提高效率四倍多。用电焊机熔炼高速钢和废刀具、小块的高速钢，熔化在一起，制成了新刀具，并保证了钢的质量，为国家节约了高速钢，促进了生产高速度的发展。
    这种工人阶级的共产主义精神，推动了技术革新、技术革命运动的向前发展。
    我厂技术革命运动，是在党的领导下，随着思想的逐步明确而开展起来的。刚一开始，我们主要针对生产薄弱环节和缺门设备，自力更生，土洋结合，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，大搞原材料生产和自制设备。我们的口号是：“自力更生、不当伸手派。”没有矽铁我们自制了矽铁电炉炼出了矽铁，缺乏焦炭我们自己炼出了焦炭。通过土办法广泛地把职工发动起来，从去年我们自己制造了四轴龙门铣、四头联动铣、五头搪孔机、八头钻床等一百四十九部，效率分别提高一至四倍。为了适应生产高速度发展，作到增产不增人，我们又根据我厂大量件多的特点，大搞程序控制和组合机床，并在这个基础上更上一层楼，向自动化迈进，大搞半自动化、自动化。
    我厂全体职工在大搞技术革新、技术革命运动中，取得胜利以后，干劲更足了。我们深深感到：党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的，我们取得的胜利，是马克思、列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。从第一季度的实践证明：我们今年一定能够取得更大的跃进，因此，我厂全体职工保证，在今年不但不增加人，而且还要抽调出一些人来支援新厂建设，现在已经抽出二百零三名四级以上的技术工人和干部，支援了新厂。在这个基础上我们还要提前一个月完成全年计划，力争全年任务翻到一倍半。
    大力支援农业技术改造
    此外，根据中央和省、市委的指示，为了加速农业技术改造。我们还要大力支援农业技术改造，目前我们已经支援或正在支援徐水、兴?等公社冲天炉、车床、水泵、马达、电气、电焊机等设备。还支援天津市鸿顺里人民公社饺子机、洗碗机等食堂机械化设备。
    为了保证实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，我们在党的领导下，要进一步全面开展以大搞半机械化、机械化，半自动化、自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，加速实现技术改造。我们计划今年全年实现较大的机械化、自动化项目五百四十七项，自制和改装机床设备五百一十多部，其中单机自动化一百七十七台，自动生产线、连续线四十六条，在“七一”前铸工车间基本成为机械化车间，为“干黑活穿白衣”打好基础，螺丝车间基本成为无屑自动化车间。
    上述规划实现以后，将进一步提高生产效率，在产品产量方面比去年实际增加一倍半，劳动生产率提高70％，钢材可节约10％到15％，木材利用率提高10％以上，成本降低22％。
    为了实现上述计划，我们还要进一步学习各兄弟厂的先进经验，今年我们到东北、上海、山西等地学习经验以后，收获很大。今后还要有计划地到各兄弟厂学习。
    为了保证胜利实现今年计划，我们在党中央、毛主席和省、市委的领导下，认真学习毛主席的著作，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大旗帜，为提前全面实现今年的光荣而艰巨的任务而奋斗。
