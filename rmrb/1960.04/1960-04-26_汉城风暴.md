    Seoul Storm

    Storm Rages Through the Center of the US-Syngman Rhee Regime
    On April 19th, a storm of anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee struggle by the South Korean people raged through Seoul, the center of the US-Syngman Rhee group's fascist colonial rule. The large-scale demonstration by tens of thousands of students and citizens in Seoul was like a thunderbolt hitting the heads of US imperialism and its running dog, Syngman Rhee.

    Seoul, where the US-Syngman Rhee group has entrenched itself for fifteen years, is a paradise for American colonialists and their running dogs, and also a hell for the broad masses of the people. On one side is a life of extravagance and debauchery; on the other, starvation, cold, and desperation. Next to the brightly lit "Bando Hotel" high-rise, where American colonialists reside, the laboring people huddle in shacks and tattered tents that do not protect them from wind and rain. A total of 600,000 people in Seoul have no housing. The monthly wages of workers in Seoul are not even one-third of the minimum living expenses for a family. University students who sell their own blood to pay exorbitant tuition fees find that 90% cannot find jobs after graduation; some carry small boxes to shine shoes on the streets. The people of Seoul have long seen through the true colors of the US-Syngman Rhee robbers, and a fire of hatred for the US-Syngman Rhee group is buried in the hearts of the broad masses of the people.

    In recent days, the anger accumulated in the hearts of the people of Seoul finally erupted. On April 6th, the people of Seoul held a large demonstration of tens of thousands of people "opposing fraudulent elections." After the people of Masan sounded the battle horn on April 11th, the fighting spirit of the people of Seoul became even more激昂, and another demonstration of tens of thousands of people broke out on the 18th. Then, on the 19th, starting at 9:00 in the morning, students from Korea University, Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Hongik University, Dongguk University, Konkuk University, and many other universities and middle schools gathered at twelve locations and began large-scale demonstrations. By noon, tens of thousands of students and citizens had converged on the most prosperous street in Seoul, Jongno, and the area in front of the pseudo-"National Assembly" building. Slogans such as "Down with the dirty government!" and "Re-run the elections!" reverberated like spring thunder in the skies above Seoul.

    Direct Assault on the Lair of the Traitors
    Syngman Rhee, panicked by the demonstrating people, mobilized a large number of police, using tear gas, water cannons, and batons to frantically suppress the demonstrating people, even opening fire on the people. This further aroused the anger of the people.

    The sound of the police's guns became a signal for the masses to seize weapons and resist. Like a tidal wave, students and citizens surrounded the large and small fascist institutions and the lairs of the traitor Syngman Rhee and his cronies in Seoul, which usually oppressed and murdered them, and engaged in heroic struggles. More than four thousand students braved the bullets and tear gas fumes of the police and stormed into the Central Office Building, the location of Syngman Rhee's "Cabinet." In an instant, stones flew, smashing the offices of the Rhee puppet "government's" Reconstruction Department, Foreign Investment Office, and Ministry of Education to pieces. The heroic demonstrators also climbed to the dome of the Central Office Building, tore down the Syngman Rhee group's "Taegeukgi" (South Korean flag), and angrily trampled it under their feet.

    The people of Seoul set fire to Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party headquarters, Syngman Rhee's propaganda organ - the "Seoul Shinmun" newspaper, the "Anti-Communist Hall," the notorious intelligence agency "Headquarters of the Greater Korean Anti-Communist Youth Corps," and the intelligence team of the Rhee puppet army's Second Army. When the demonstrators broke into the Liberal Party headquarters, Syngman Rhee's lackeys, who usually rode on the necks of the people and acted arrogantly, all scurried away with their heads in their hands.

    At about 1:00 p.m., more than 10,000 students, citizens, and others from Dongguk University, holding stones, wooden sticks, and axes, roared and rushed straight at Syngman Rhee's "official residence" - Gyeongmudae, reaching a point about thirty meters from the entrance of Gyeongmudae. A large number of Rhee puppet constables, armed with guns, hurriedly formed a wall with cars, erected barbed wire, and opened fire on the crowd. More than a dozen people were killed and wounded on the spot in front of the gate. But the heroic people did not retreat. They fought the Rhee puppet constables with stones and smashed a police station in front of Gyeongmudae to pieces. The insurgents also wanted to topple the bronze statue of General MacArthur, the first commander of the US forces in the Korean War, and they destroyed the "US Economic Cooperation Office in Korea," an organization for American economic aggression against South Korea.

    Resilient People, Heroic Battle
    Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Seoul engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Rhee puppet military and police throughout the city. According to South Korean news agencies, "At dusk on this day, fires blazed everywhere in Seoul, and the shouts of the insurgents fighting the military and police and the sound of gunfire were woven together," and "the streets of Seoul were full of insurgents who had been killed and wounded." But the heroic people of Seoul "advanced wave upon wave." They "waved the bloody clothes of the dead and charged the military and police." The people of Seoul also attacked the Rhee puppet police's armories and ammunition depots, seizing a large number of carbines and pistols, and exchanged fire with the Rhee puppet military and police. They seized all the fire trucks used by the Rhee puppet police to suppress the people, and used the water cannons on the trucks to blast the police, drenching them like drowned rats. They also seized more than forty vehicles from the Rhee puppet military and police, riding in them to attack and occupy "police stations" and "police substations" everywhere.

    Syngman Rhee, frightened like an ant on a hot pot, convened an "emergency cabinet meeting" on the "isolated island" (Gyeongmudae) surrounded by the people. At this time, US imperialism inhumanely mobilized the Rhee puppet army's 15th Division, handing it over to Syngman Rhee to slaughter the people of Seoul. From 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., the Rhee puppet army, carrying heavy weapons such as American-made tanks and rocket launchers, successively entered Seoul and carried out a bloody massacre of the people.

    The people of Seoul, who have a glorious tradition of fighting against aggressors, did not yield. Although more than 380 demonstrators had been killed and wounded by 9:30 p.m. that day, they continued to fight the division of Rhee puppet troops with seized weapons, stones, and bricks. Because the Syngman Rhee group banned reports on the uprising from that night onwards, it is still impossible to fully know the heroic deeds of the insurgents. However, from the speech of Song Yo-chan, the Chief of Staff of the Rhee puppet army and executioner, people know that the insurgents occupied the two areas of Miarri and Anam-dong in Seoul at that time and continued to fight until the afternoon of the 20th. Thousands of other insurgents have moved to the deep mountains around Seoul.

    On this day, April 19th, the US forces stationed in Korea planned to launch "Honest John" missiles in South Korea in an attempt to intimidate the South Korean people, but the heroic people of Seoul responded to the challenge of US imperialism with an unprecedented anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee struggle.

    Dictator Syngman Rhee Cannot Escape the Punishment of the People
    The uprising of the people of Seoul frightened US imperialism and Syngman Rhee. After Syngman Rhee brought in a division of "large armies" to plunge the people of Seoul into a bloodbath, he was still beside himself with fear, and he suffered from a "phobia" of the people's actions. The next day, he hurriedly ordered barricades of sandbags and stones to be built in front of the "official residence" - Gyeongmudae, deployed lines of troops and police, and brought in tanks, cowering behind American-made tanks to prolong his life.

    Now, Syngman Rhee is even afraid of seven or eight-year-old primary school students. The "martial law" issued by Syngman Rhee on the 19th forced all schools in Seoul, including primary schools, to stop classes, because he was afraid that the students would gather to deal with him. In addition, he prohibited people from collectively going to hospitals to see the wounded demonstrators, and prohibited people from traveling at night.

    The Rhee puppet central organs, which were beaten to pieces by the people of Seoul, presented a scene of "when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter." The Rhee puppet officials who went to work were always preparing to run away quickly in case the people attacked, and they also made "emergency arrangements" for "important documents."

    In addition, Syngman Rhee is staging an ugly drama of deceiving the people under the direction of his brilliant director, the American master, letting his accomplice Lee Ki-poong come out on the 23rd to "declare" that he would "resign" from the position of "Vice President," and also clamoring to implement the cabinet responsibility system, which Syngman Rhee has firmly opposed for many years, and to "reform the political system." All this only reflects the ugly state of the US-Syngman Rhee group, who have lost their souls under the blows of the powerful people's forces. For more than a decade, the South Korean people, who have heard enough of Syngman Rhee's lies and suffered enough of his atrocities, do not believe that the executioner Syngman Rhee will lay down his butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. The three million people of the entire Korean peninsula have stood up and are determined to punish the traitor Syngman Rhee. No matter what tricks Syngman Rhee plays, he will not be able to escape the fate arranged for him by history. (Attached picture)

    汉城风暴
    新华社记者　王玉章
    风暴狂卷美李统治中心
    4月19日，南朝鲜人民反美反李斗争的风暴狂卷美李集团法西斯殖民统治的中心——汉城。汉城数万学生和市民举行的大示威，像一个霹雷轰在美帝国主义和它的走狗李承晚的头上。
    美李集团盘踞了十五年的汉城，是美国殖民者和它的走狗们的乐园，也是广大人民的地狱。一边是花天酒地、荒淫无耻；一边是饥寒交迫、走投无路。在美国殖民者盘踞着的灯红酒绿的“半岛旅馆”高楼旁边，劳苦人民蜷伏在不蔽风雨的板棚和破帐棚里度日。汉城共有六十万人民没有房子住。汉城的工人每月的工资不够一家最低生活费的三分之一。以出卖自己的鲜血来缴纳高昂的学费的大学生，毕业后有90％找不到职业；有的背起小箱到街上给人擦皮鞋。汉城人民早已看清了美李强盗的本色，广大人民的心中都埋藏着一股憎恨美李集团的怒火。
    这些日子，汉城人民心中郁积的怒火终于爆发了。4月6日，汉城人民举行了上万人的“反对欺骗选举”的大示威。马山人民在4月11日吹起战斗的号角以后，汉城人民的斗争情绪更加激昂，在18日又爆发了一次数万人的示威。紧接着，19日，从早晨九时起，汉城市的高丽大学、汉城大学、延世大学、宏毅大学、东国大学、建国大学以及许多高等学校和中学的学生们，分别在十二个地点集结，开始了大规模的示威。到中午时分，就有数万学生和市民汇合在汉城最繁华的大街——钟路和伪“国会”议事堂前面一带。“打倒肮脏的政府！”“重新进行选举！”等口号，像春雷一样在汉城上空震响。
    直捣卖国贼的巢穴
    被示威人民吓慌了的李承晚，调动大批警察，用催泪弹、水龙、木棒疯狂镇压示威人民，竟至向人民开枪射击。这更加激起了人民的怒火。
    警察的枪声成了群众夺取武装进行反抗的信号。学生、市民像潮水一样包围了平时压迫他们、杀害他们的汉城市的大大小小的法西斯机构和卖国贼李承晚及其党羽们的巢穴，并且展开了英勇的搏斗。四千多名学生冒着警察的枪弹和催泪弹的烟雾，冲进了李承晚的“内阁”所在地——中央厅，刹时间石块横飞，把李伪“政府”的复兴部、外资厅、文教部等机构的办公室砸了个稀烂。英勇的示威人民还登上中央厅的圆顶，撕下了李承晚集团的“太极旗”，愤怒地把它践踏在脚底下。
    汉城人民放火烧了李承晚的自由党总部、李承晚的造谣机关——“汉城新闻”社、“反共会馆”、臭名远扬的特务机关“大韩反共青年会总部”和李伪军第二军特务队。当示威人民打进自由党总部的时候，平日骑在人民脖子上作威作福的李承晚的喽罗们都抱头鼠窜了。
    下午一时许，东国大学的学生、市民等一万多人拿着石头、木棒、斧头怒吼着直扑李承晚的“官邸”——景武台，一直冲到离景武台的入口三十米左右的地方。荷枪实弹守卫在景武台前的大批李伪宪兵，慌忙用汽车排成一堵墙，又架起铁丝网，并向群众开枪射击。当场就在门前打死打伤了十几个人。但英勇的人民并没有后退，他们用石块和李伪宪兵们作战，还把景武台前的一个警察派出所砸个粉碎。起义人民还要推倒侵朝美军首任统帅麦克阿瑟的铜像，他们捣毁了美国对南朝鲜进行经济侵略的机构——“美国驻韩经济合作处”。
    不屈的人民，英勇的战斗
    汉城数万示威人民，在整个汉城市区内同李伪军警展开了肉搏战。据南朝鲜的通讯社报道说，“在这一天黄昏的时候，汉城市内四处火花烛天，起义人民同军警搏斗的呼喊声、枪声织成一片”，“汉城的街道上到处是被打死打伤的起义人民”。但是英雄的汉城人民“前仆后继”。他们“挥动着死者的血衣，向军警冲锋”，汉城人民还袭击了李伪警察的武器库和弹药库，夺来了大量的卡宾枪和手枪，同李伪军警对射。他们把李伪警察用来镇压人民的救火车全部夺过来，用车上的水龙冲击警察，把警察喷得像落汤鸡。他们还夺取了四十多辆李伪军警的汽车，乘在汽车上到处袭击和攻占“警察署”和“派出所”。
    被吓得像热锅上的蚂蚁的李承晚，在被人民包围着的“孤岛”（景武台）上召集了“紧急内阁会议”。这时候，美帝国主义竟灭绝人性地调动李伪军第十五师团，交给李承晚来屠杀汉城人民。下午六时到十时，携带着美国造的坦克和火箭炮等重武器的李伪军队陆续开进汉城，对人民进行了血腥的屠杀。
    具有反抗侵略者的光荣斗争传统的汉城人民并没有屈服。虽然到这天晚上九时半已有三百八十多名示威人民被打死打伤，但他们用夺来的武器、石块、砖头继续同一个师团的李伪军作战。由于李承晚集团从这天晚上开始禁止了有关起义斗争的报道，因而至今人们还无法完全知道起义人民的英勇事迹。但是从李承晚集团陆军参谋总长、刽子手宋尧赞发表的谈话中，人们知道起义人民当时占领了汉城市弥阿里和安岩洞两个地区，一直到20日的下午还在继续战斗。还有数以千计的起义人民转移到汉城周围的深山里去了。
    就在19日这一天，侵朝美军有计划地在南朝鲜发射了“诚实的约翰”式导弹，妄图威吓南朝鲜人民，但是英雄的汉城人民在这一天用空前规模的反美反李斗争回答了美帝国主义的挑战。
    独夫李承晚难逃人民的惩罚
    汉城人民的起义吓坏了美帝国主义和李承晚。李承晚调来一个师团的“大军”把汉城人民侵入血泊中以后，自己仍然魂不守舍，他已患了对人民行动的“恐怖症”。第二天他慌忙下令在“官邸”——景武台门前用沙袋、石头筑起了街垒，派一队队军警布下了防线，还调来了坦克，躲在美国造的坦克后面苟延残喘。
    现在，李承晚连七八岁的小学生也害怕了。19日李承晚下的“戒严令”强迫汉城市的包括小学在内的各级学校一律停止上课，他怕学生们集合起来对付他。另外，他禁止人民集体到医院去看被打伤的示威群众，禁止人民夜间通行。
    被汉城人民打得落花流水的李伪中央机关，呈现着一片“树倒猢狲散”的景象。上班的李伪官吏们时刻在准备一旦人民来袭时赶快逃跑，他们对“重要文件”也作了“紧急处理”。
    另外，李承晚正在他的高明的导演——美国主子的指使下演出欺骗人民的丑剧，让他的帮凶李起鹏在23日出来“声明”要“辞退”“副总统”职务，还扬言要实行李承晚多年来坚决不赞成的内阁责任制，“改革政治制度”。这一切只不过反映了在强大的人民的力量的打击下，美李集团失魂落魄的丑态。十几年来，听尽了李承晚的谎话，受尽了他的暴行的南朝鲜人民，不相信刽子手李承晚会放下屠刀立地成佛。全朝鲜三千万人民已经站起来了，决心要惩办卖国贼李承晚。李承晚不论耍什么花招都将无法脱逃历史为他安排下的命运。（附图片）
