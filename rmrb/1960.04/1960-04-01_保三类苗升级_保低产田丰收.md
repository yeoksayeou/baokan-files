The Huaiyin Prefecture of Jiangsu Province Vigorously Grasps Weak Links and Makes Concentrated Efforts to Eliminate Third-Class Wheat Fields
(According to our report) People's communes across Hebei Province, on the basis of implementing the "Three Guarantees" down to the team level, have universally launched a vigorous wheat super-production campaign. During this movement, various localities have focused on meticulous management of wheat, upgrading 60% of the province's third-class wheat seedlings.

This year, the sowing quality of Hebei Province's 32 million mu of wheat has generally improved compared to previous years. Over 70% of the province's wheat fields have achieved water conservancy, most fields have been deeply plowed to a depth of seven inches to one foot or more, an average of 5,000 jin of base fertilizer has been applied per mu, the seeding rate is appropriate, and basically improved varieties have been used. Winter and spring wheat field management work in various localities has also been better than in previous years. 20 million mu of wheat fields have been irrigated with winter water, and 29 million mu have received topdressing. Therefore, wheat recovery in general areas is five to ten days earlier than in the past, with robust seedlings and numerous tillers. First and second-class wheat fields account for 90% of the total wheat field area in the province. These favorable conditions have laid a good foundation for achieving wheat super-production this year.

In order to ensure that super-production is based on a solid and reliable foundation, while focusing on large-area high-yield square increase production competitions, various localities have also carried out wheat field upgrading movements such as third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, low yields catching up with high yields, spring wheat catching up with autumn wheat, and actual yields exceeding contracted yields.

During the movement, local Party committee secretaries took the lead in creating "Third-Class Wheat Upgrade Experimental Fields." In the Tianjin area, in order to eliminate low-yield wheat, Party committee secretaries at all levels led a large number of cadres to settle in low-yield areas, organized a 250,000-strong professional team to transform low-yield fields, launched a concentrated battle to "upgrade third-class wheat," and universally promoted the "four determinations" (determining plots, personnel, measures, and quality) and "two guarantees" (leaders guaranteeing areas, production teams and commune members guaranteeing squares) responsibility system. They also widely summarized and promoted advanced management experiences through holding on-site meetings, professional seminars, and organizing visits and comparisons. In the Shijiazhuang area, county to production team levels contracted responsibility for third-class seedlings and third-class fields. Party committee secretaries at all levels exchanged experiences in upgrading third-class wheat through the methods of establishing pace-setters and taking sample plots. In order to promote the upgrading of third-class wheat as soon as possible, Party committees at all levels in the Handan area absorbed local scientific and technical researchers and production experts to analyze the development of third-class seedlings in low-yield areas plot by plot, and formulated measures to strengthen wheat management based on local conditions. 580,000 mu of third-class wheat seedlings in the district have already been upgraded.

During the wheat super-production campaign, various localities have also used soil improvement methods to eliminate low-yield fields. In the Baoding area, measures such as loosening the soil by hoeing, suppressing alkali with large amounts of water, and applying organic fertilizers were universally adopted for 300,000 mu of saline-alkali low-yield wheat fields. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to carry out large-scale soil improvement work such as pulling sand to suppress alkali and sweeping alkali, and 100,000 mu of low-lying wheat fields were transformed into ridged fields with ditches.

In order to achieve the wheat super-production plan and rapidly push wheat field management work to a new upsurge, the province recently organized wheat field management inspection teams composed of secretaries in charge of wheat and agricultural bureau chiefs at the prefectural (municipal) and county levels. Through inspection and comparison, they planted red flags and established pace-setters to further promote the in-depth development of the super-production movement. Up to now, 17,655,000 mu of wheat fields in the province have been irrigated with revival water, accounting for 55% of the wheat fields that should be irrigated; 25 million mu have been topdressed; and over 20 million mu have been cultivated.

(According to our report) The Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province has seized the favorable opportunity after rain and snow to mobilize the masses to strengthen wheat field management, launching a vigorous mass movement to skillfully apply jointing fertilizer, loosen the soil to preserve moisture, and "catch up on five things" (third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, distant fields catching up with nearby fields, lean fields catching up with fertile fields, late seedlings catching up with early seedlings, mountainous areas catching up with plains), striving for a bumper summer harvest. Now, from the deep mountains to the plains, from the hilly areas to the sandy depressions, everywhere there are streams of people delivering fertilizer to ensure a good harvest. More than 1.5 million wheat field management soldiers, pulling, pushing, lifting, carrying, and shouldering, are working day and night in shifts. From March 15th to 21st, out of the 12.6 million mu of wheat fields in the district, 4.8 million mu (38% of the total area) had jointing fertilizer applied, with an average of over 3,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and about 35 jin of fine fertilizer per mu, an average daily progress of 800,000 mu. While applying jointing fertilizer in large quantities, soil was also loosened to preserve moisture. As of March 21st, the area of loosened soil had reached 6,150,000 mu, accounting for 48.8% of the total area.

In order to ensure that all types of wheat fields achieve a bumper harvest, the Prefectural Committee promptly put forward the battle cry of "Skillfully apply jointing fertilizer, the whole people engage in 'five catch-ups'," focusing on weak links. The Pingdingshan Municipal Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, universally established command posts or command centers from the county to the commune, brigade, and production team levels, and transferred 454 cadres, led by the first secretaries of the county and commune, to strengthen leadership in weak areas. Lin'ying County transferred 7,000 laborers to specialize in managing 45,000 mu of third-class seedlings (averaging 6.4 mu per person), and by the 21st, an average of 8,000 jin of coarse fertilizer had been applied to each mu of third-class wheat fields. In applying fertilizer, various localities have also "prescribed the right medicine" according to different conditions, focusing on applying nitrogen fertilizer to third-class fields, such as human manure and urine. In terms of fertilizer application methods, they have also achieved coarse fertilizer being applied finely to prevent the loss of fertilizer effectiveness. Through the "five catch-ups," the appearance of low-yield fields is rapidly changing.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 31st. In wheat field management, the Huaiyin Prefecture of Jiangsu Province has focused on weak links and launched a movement throughout the prefecture to have low-yield fields catch up with high-yield fields, distant fields catch up with nearby fields, late seedlings catch up with early seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings. At present, 300,000 mu of distant fields in the district have caught up with nearby fields, 500,000 mu of late seedlings have caught up with early seedlings, 100,000 mu of low-yield fields have caught up with high-yield fields, and nearly 400,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded.

Due to early planting, good planting, and meticulous management last year, the 7.8 million mu of "Sanmai" (barley, wheat, and Yuanmai) in the Huaiyin Prefecture are generally growing vigorously, better than any previous year. However, there are still imbalances. The wheat seedlings in some late-stubble low-yield fields and distant fields are not growing evenly enough, and there are still nearly one million mu of third-class seedlings in the district. After discovering this situation in a timely manner, the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee immediately took measures to organize the masses to launch a wheat field management movement centered on eliminating third-class seedlings.

The main measures taken by various localities to eliminate third-class seedlings are to universally apply fertilizer, apply more fertilizer, apply good fertilizer, and topdress with fast-acting fertilizer. Shuyang people in the lake and marsh areas with more land and fewer people have broken the old habit of "lake and marsh fields cannot apply a large amount of water fertilizer," universally applying water fertilizer to 69,000 mu of third-class seedlings and launching a wheat seedling upgrade competition. After the concentrated efforts in mid-March, these 60,000+ mu of third-class seedlings quickly changed their appearance and put on green clothes. After key processing, 30,000 mu of the 80,000 mu of third-class seedlings in Suqian County have been upgraded. The Sanmai of the 60,000 mu of distant fields in the lake and marsh area of ​​Sihong County have also been universally topdressed with a fast-acting fertilizer, and are currently growing very well and are close to the wheat seedlings in nearby fields.

In wheat field management, various localities have also organized professional teams with 540,000 people participating, specializing in eliminating third-class seedlings. Many professional teams have also implemented a field management responsibility system of determining people, fields, time, seedlings, and work points. Professional teams composed of 45,000 people in Shuyang County are all setting up camps in the fields. Huachong Commune in this county also built 170 sheds in the fields and set up 36 field canteens to focus on eliminating third-class seedlings.

    河北轰轰烈烈开展小麦超产竞赛
    保三类苗升级　保低产田丰收
    河南许昌地委加强领导力争各类麦田块块高产
    江苏淮阴专区狠抓薄弱环节突击消灭三类麦田
    本报讯　河北省各地人民公社，在三包落实到队的基础上，普遍掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的小麦超产竞赛运动。在运动中，各地大抓小麦精心管理，使全省60％的三类麦都升了级。
    今年，河北省三千二百万亩小麦的播种质量普遍比往年提高，全省70％以上的麦田实现了水利化，大部分麦田都深翻了七寸到一尺以上，平均每亩施底肥五千斤，下种量适当，并且基本上实现了优种化。各地冬春的麦田管理工作也比往年做得好。有二千万亩麦田浇了冻水，两千九百万亩施了追肥。因此，一般地区的小麦返青都比过去提前五天至十天，麦苗茁壮，分蘖多，全省一、二类麦田占麦田总面积的90％。这些优越的条件，给实现今年小麦超产打下了良好基础。
    为了使超产建立在扎实可靠的基础上，全省在大抓大面积丰产方增产竞赛的同时，各地都开展了三类苗赶一类苗、低产赶高产、春麦赶秋麦和实产超包产的麦田升级运动。
    运动中，各地党委书记挂帅大搞“三类麦升级试验田”。天津地区为了消灭低产麦，各级党委书记带领大批干部到低产区落户，组织了二十五万人的改造低产田的专业队伍，展开“三类麦升级”突击战，普遍推广了四定（定地块、定人员、定措施、定质量）两包（领导包片、生产队和社员包方）责任制，并通过召开现场会、专业座谈会、组织参观评比办法，广泛总结与推广先进管理经验。石家庄地区由县到生产队逐级分包三类苗，三类田，各级书记通过树标兵、拿样板的办法，交流了三类麦升级的经验。邯郸地区为尽快促进三类麦升级，各级党委都吸收当地科学技术研究人员和生产能手，逐片逐块地分析低产区三类苗的发育情况，因地制宜地制定了加强小麦的管理办法，全区已有五十八万亩三类麦苗升了级。
    在麦田超产竞赛运动中，各地还用改良土壤的方法消灭低产田。保定地区对三十万亩盐碱低产麦田，普遍采取中耕松土，大水压碱，追施有机肥料等措施；同时，发动群众进行了大规模地拉沙压碱扫碱等土壤改良工作，把十万亩低洼麦田修建成沟洫畦田。
    为了实现小麦超产计划，把麦田管理工作迅速推向新高潮，全省最近还组织了由专（市）、县主管小麦的书记和农业局长等组成小麦田间管理检查团，通过检查、评比，大插红旗，大树标兵，进一步促进超产运动的深入开展。到目前为止，全省已有一千七百六十五万亩麦田浇上返青水，占应浇麦田的55％；追肥二千五百多万亩；中耕二千多万亩。
    本报讯　中共河南省许昌地委抓紧雨雪过后的有利时机，发动群众加强麦田管理，在全区开展了一个轰轰烈烈的巧施拔节肥、松土保墒和“五赶”（三类苗赶一类苗，远田赶近田，瘦田赶肥田，晚茬赶早茬，山区赶平原）的群众运动，力争夏季大丰收。现在，全区从深山到平原，从丘陵地区到沙地洼地，到处都是送肥保丰收的人流。一百五十多万麦田管理大军，拉的拉，推的推，抬的抬，担的担，日夜不息地轮班奋战。从3月15日到21日，全区一千二百六十万亩麦田，已有四百八十万亩（占总面积的38％）施入了拔节肥，每亩平均施粗肥三千斤以上，细肥三十五斤左右，日进度平均八十万亩。在大施拔节肥的同时，还进行了松土保墒。截至3月21日，松土面积已达六百一十五万亩，占总面积的48.8％。
    为了保证各类麦田齐获丰收，地委又及时提出了“巧施拔节肥，全民闹‘五赶’”的战斗口号，重点突击薄弱环节。平顶山市根据地委指示精神，从县到社、大队和生产队，普遍建立了指挥部或指挥所，并抽调四百五十四名干部，在县、社第一书记的带领下，到薄弱地区加强领导。临颍县抽调了七千名劳力专管四万五千亩三类苗（每人合六亩四分），到21日止，三类麦田每亩已普施八千斤粗肥。在施肥中，各地根据不同情况“对症下药”，对三类田着重施氮肥，如人粪尿等肥料。在施肥的方法上，还都做到了粗肥细施，防止肥效流失。通过“五赶”，低产田面貌正在迅速改变。
    本报南京31日电　江苏省淮阴专区在麦田管理中，狠抓薄弱环节，在全区开展了低产田赶高产田，远田赶近田、晚茬赶早茬和消灭三类苗的运动。目前全区已有三十万亩远田赶上了近田，五十万亩晚茬赶上了早茬，十万亩低产田赶上了高产田，有近四十万亩三类苗升了级。
    淮阴专区七百八十多万亩三麦（大麦、小麦、元麦）由于去年种得早，种得好，管理精细，普遍生长旺盛，比以往任何一年都好。可是仍有不平衡的现象，一部分茬口晚的低产田和远田，麦苗生长不够齐整，全区还有近百万亩三类苗，淮阴地委及时发现了这一情况后，立即采取措施，组织群众掀起了以消灭三类苗为中心的麦田管理运动。
    各地消灭三类苗的主要措施是，普施肥、多施肥、施好肥和追施速效肥。地多人少的湖荡地区的沭阳人民，打破了“湖荡田无法大量施水肥”的老习惯，对六万九千亩三类苗普施水肥，并且开展了麦苗升级比赛。经过3月中旬的突击，这六万多亩三类苗很快变了样，穿上了绿装。宿迁县八万亩三类苗经过重点加工，目前已有三万亩升了级。泗洪县湖荡地区六万亩远田的三麦也普遍追施了一次速效肥，目前长势很好，已接近近田麦苗。
    各地在麦田管理中，还组织了有五十四万人参加的专业队，专门消灭三类苗。有许多专业队还实行了定人、定田、定时、定苗、定工分的田间管理责任制。沭阳县由四万五千人组成的专业队都在田头安营扎寨。这个县的华冲公社还在田头搭了一百七十个棚子，办了三十六个田头食堂，突击消灭三类苗。
