Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch. The Chunshu Hutong area in Xuanwu District, an ordinary residential area in the capital, has witnessed vigorous development in production, a spirited laboring population, further emancipation of housewives, and further improvement in people's lives since the establishment of the Chunshu People's Commune a year and a half ago. This residential area, which had historically only consumed and did not produce, has become a happy garden where residents participate in socialist construction and organize collective life.

	In this 750,000-square-meter residential area, there are more than 13,000 families and over 56,000 people. Before the establishment of the People's Commune in September 1958, more than 30,000 people were already employed or studying. Among the remaining 20,000 people, more than 6,420 had the ability to work, the vast majority being family members of employees. After the establishment of the commune, 88.9%, or more than 5,710 of these residents with labor capacity, freed themselves from household burdens and successively took up posts in production labor and social service work. Under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic support of the workers and masses, they successively built eighteen initial-scale factories, including instrument factories, glass factories, and chemical factories producing relatively complex products, as well as wood products factories, mat factories, and sewing factories producing daily necessities; from paste factories with more than 30 people to plastic factories with more than 500 people, and newly organized comprehensive factories. The comprehensive factory has "large-scale centralized production," "small-scale centralized production," and "decentralized production groups." With the increase and expansion of canteens and childcare organizations, many housewives who originally engaged in decentralized production have recently freed themselves from household labor and are concentrated in factories and groups near their homes for production. A small number of people who have sick family members, are not in good health themselves, or have particularly heavy household burdens, but are willing to participate in some labor, have also been initially organized to take work home under the unified management of the comprehensive factory. Under the guidance of the principles of serving large-scale industry, serving the people's lives, and serving urban construction, these factories have achieved great development in production. The output value in the second half of 1958 was more than 310,000 yuan, which rose to more than 8.5 million yuan for the whole year of 1959, and jumped to more than 12.6 million yuan in the first quarter of this year, exceeding 48.7% of the total for the previous year. In the past year and a half, the commune-run factories have accumulated nearly 1.4 million yuan, and have allocated funds from the accumulation to add 437 sets of various equipment, including lathes, planers, milling machines, punching machines, and electronic heat sealers, arming themselves from scratch.

	The factories run by this commune have flexible and diverse characteristics in production, playing a role of "picking up the leftovers and filling the gaps" in the production field. At the same time, in the process of processing for large-scale industries, they are constantly improving their technology and producing some relatively high-end products. Now, the number of products of the entire commune has increased from 71 last year to 159. Among them, more than 40 products, such as glass products, insulating materials, dyeing, and cloth tape measures, are outsourced to them by large factories and larger factories, which gives the commune factories the opportunity to develop more rapidly, and also enables the large factories or larger factories to free up their hands to produce more high-end products. The city-famous Yidege Ink Factory handed over the production of paste products to the commune's paste factory last year, saving itself 14 factory buildings and freeing up 18 laborers. Currently, 15 kinds of advertising colors, 7 kinds of cosmetic colors, and 30 kinds of watercolor new products have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. The third workshop of the state-owned Xinghua Dyestuff Factory handed over the production of the "Aier Dyeing" product, which had been produced for many years, to the commune's chemical factory, and switched to producing high-end dyes. Without increasing workers or equipment, it completed the production leap forward plan, and the total output value last year increased more than tenfold compared with the previous year. With the great development of production, these factories need more and more projects for commune-run factories to process, so they are more actively providing technical support, and at the same time, on the principle of equivalent exchange, they help commune-run factories solve some production equipment problems. After Xinghua Dyestuff Factory and the commune's chemical factory established contact in production, they helped the commune's chemical factory solve problems such as production technology, which made the output of "Aier Dyeing" produced by the commune rapidly increase. In addition to meeting the needs of the Beijing market, it is also sold in some towns in North China. Now, in the Beijing market, from children's diapers and chicken feather dusters sold in daily sundry stores to plastic handbags and glass buckles sold in Wangfujing Department Store, there are products from this commune. The commune's plastic factory, whose factory buildings are scattered in four hutongs, produces plastic raincoats and protective clothing worth more than ten yuan apiece, as well as badge holders and candy bags worth only a few cents to more than one jiao. They produce whatever the market needs, without simply pursuing output value. Recently, they have also trial-produced new products such as plastic medicine bottles and plastic buttons according to market needs. The two comprehensive factories recently formed on the basis of production groups are almost entirely serving the business of processing urgently needed by the market.

	The establishment of the Chunshu Commune has a deep ideological and material foundation. It was born in the nationwide rectification movement and the great leap forward in socialist construction. The residents here (mainly housewives) participated in the great rectification movement in 1958, and their ideological awareness was unprecedentedly improved. The idea that labor is glorious and that not laboring is shameful has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Under the encouragement of the three red banners of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, in order to quickly get rid of the backward situation of poverty and blankness in our country, and at the same time to liberate themselves from household chores, they put forward the slogan of "adding bricks and tiles for socialism," and urgently demanded to participate in production labor. At this time, due to the high-speed development of socialist construction, factories and mining enterprises also hoped that someone could carry out some auxiliary labor for them, and even directly produce some relatively secondary products for them. A revolutionary storm of housewives going out of their homes to participate in socialist construction thus rose in response to the trend. In this revolutionary storm, activists among the residents and working women with urgent employment needs walked at the forefront of the movement. Under the leadership of the street party organization, they fully carried forward the spirit of poor and hard work, adapted to local conditions, made do with whatever was available, and relied on their own efforts to start factories from scratch. Nine family members of employees in the Xichunshu Hutong area borrowed two bellows and two old pots from neighbors, picked up some broken bricks, and fought hard overnight to build two stoves in a large courtyard. Everyone pooled together two yuan and forty cents to buy some masks and gloves, and pulled back waste sulfuric acid that had been used to wash foreign nails from a nearby nail-making factory, and pulled back some scrap iron filings from a machinery factory. In this way, a small chemical factory was established. More than 200 housewives in Xicaochang used a dilapidated house that had been in disrepair for many years and was uninhabited, braved the rain, pulled soil, transported bricks, and built workbenches, fighting hard for three days, and set up a binding factory and a toy factory. They folded book pages, made toys, and boiled ferrous sulfate from waste sulfuric acid and iron filings. The processing fees they received were used to add equipment and purchase raw materials, and to continuously expand reproduction. Their relatives who had a skill also used their spare time to help them overcome difficulties. Technicians drew drawings and designs for them, and construction workers helped repair the factory buildings. Because of the contact with state-owned factories in production, many factories, in addition to allocating some scraps or waste materials to them as raw materials at price, also sent department personnel to help them establish enterprise management systems, and sent old workers to teach them technology, or let them go to the factory to learn. Through these methods, a group of "technical backbones" were quickly cultivated. This group of "technical backbones" in turn quickly imparted production technology to more people. Many factories grew up rapidly from nothing, from small to large, and from decentralized to centralized. The small chemical factory run by nine women is now a factory with nearly 300 workers, producing products with a monthly output value of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The expansion and development of production has attracted more and more women to take up production posts.

	When housewives started production empty-handed, it was initially regarded as "novelty" in this area. Some people were afraid that women would be dragged down by household chores such as cooking and taking care of children, and would not be able to persist. At this time, the Party organization came out to boost their morale: "If you can build factories by relying on your own efforts, why can't you build collective living welfare undertakings by relying on your own efforts!" The women then set up the first public canteens and childcare organizations. Because it served production and had a close relationship with production undertakings, it had strong vitality. With the development of production and the increase in accumulation, the commune's collective living welfare and social service undertakings were also getting better and better. On the basis of production development, the commune started from production and allocated a portion of funds from the accumulation to subsidize the establishment of collective welfare undertakings. Now, under unified management, the commune has established a living service network centered on public canteens. The canteen takes the large to lead the small, with 20 small and medium-sized canteens distributed around the three large canteens. Many nurseries and kindergartens also have children's canteens, with more than 5,100 people joining the meals. The large canteen not only uses the ability of cooking machinery to process staple foods for some surrounding small and medium-sized canteens, but also set up a laundry, shower room, and distillation room near the canteen, making full use of the waste steam and waste hot water of the steam boiler to wash clothes, provide showers, and make distilled water, so as to achieve "one thing for multiple purposes," which greatly increased the income of the canteen and provided conditions for further improving meals. The commune has set up 76 nurseries, kindergartens, and breastfeeding rooms near residents' homes and factories, accommodating a total of more than 3,480 children. The Sichuanying Nursery, known as a red flag unit in the city, from November last year to February this year, the average weight of each of the 100 children in the nursery increased by one jin per month. Through political and cultural lessons for childcare workers, as well as off-the-job rotation training and learning at municipal nurseries, a team of childcare workers with relatively progressive thinking, preliminary mastery of business, and a certain level of culture was quickly established, and vigorously supported the newly built nurseries and kindergartens. Now, all childcare organizations in the commune are learning from it. In addition, more than 20 life service stations are scattered throughout the streets and alleys, taking on many scattered household chores.

	With the development of production and the continuous improvement of social service undertakings, it has also powerfully promoted the overall leap forward of the commune's cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings. Now, the entire commune has established 16 spare-time schools, opened 87 classes, and more than 1,300 production personnel are participating in the study. The commune also runs a hospital and two medical and health stations. The economic income of the commune members has also been correspondingly improved. In addition to the collective welfare undertakings being subsidized by the commune, the average monthly wage of production personnel has increased from 8 or 9 yuan at the beginning to the current 23 yuan.

	After women participated in production and collective life, their mental outlook has begun to change, their family and social status have been significantly improved, and new types of democratic, harmonious, equal, mutual assistance, and happy families with common goals have emerged more and more. Before Luan Yaokui, the mother of five children, participated in production, her husband thought that she could only do housework. When a guest came to the house, Luan Yaokui interjected a word, and her husband said, "What do you know? Go take care of the children!" After Luan Yaokui participated in production, she was continuously selected as a red flag bearer, became a work section chief, and attended the Beijing Heroes' Meeting. Now, her husband respects her very much and has become a good couple who love and help each other. The women's political and ideological awareness and leadership and management abilities have also been greatly improved. Now, eight street women in the entire commune have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, 170 women are serving as factory directors, workshop directors, and heads of public canteens, childcare organizations, and service stations, and more than 100 people have been rated as advanced producers, advanced workers, and "March 8th" red flag bearers in Beijing and Xuanwu District. In order to further cultivate and improve grassroots leading backbones, the commune party committee specially holds party classes and political classes for female activists. Now, the number of people attending party classes has increased from more than 20 last year to more than 200.

	The commune recently held a meeting of commune member representatives, summarized the various tasks since the establishment of the commune a year and a half ago, elected a new management committee, and formulated a leap forward plan for 1960. The meeting proposed that the current task is to continue to develop production and run collective welfare undertakings well, resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, and further consolidate and improve the commune politically, economically, and organizationally. According to the plan, the total industrial output value, the labor productivity of all employees, and the quality of products of the commune this year must have great improvements and growth. The main measures are: strengthening production management, doing a good job in safe production, vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and striving to basically realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in centralized production factories before the end of the year. The meeting also made specific provisions on comprehensively organizing people's economic life and running cultural, educational, and health undertakings. After the meeting of commune member representatives, a new upsurge of production has been set off in the entire commune, the production outlook is changing every day, and new products are constantly emerging. Production and service personnel participating in factories, canteens, childcare organizations, and service stations are also implementing the spirit of the meeting with practical actions, and are determined to strive for an all-round leap forward in production construction, cultural, educational, health, and collective living welfare undertakings.

    首都椿树人民公社春色满园
    建成十八个工厂、数十个食堂、七十六个托儿组织和二十多个服务站  人们精神面貌开始发生变化，出现了许多新型的民主和睦的幸福家庭
    新华社18日讯　首都的一个普通居民区——宣武区椿树胡同一带，在一年半前成立椿树人民公社以后，生产事业蓬勃发展，劳动人民精神奋发，家庭妇女得到进一步解放，人民生活有了进一步的提高。这个历来只消费不生产的居民区，已经变成居民们参加社会主义建设和组织集体生活的幸福园地。
    在这个七十五万平方米的居民区里，有一万三千多个家庭，五万六千多人。1958年9月人民公社成立以前，已有三万多人就业就学；在其余的二万多人中，有六千四百二十多名有劳动能力的人，绝大多数是职工家属。公社成立以后，在这批有劳动能力的居民中，有88.9％即五千七百一十多人，摆脱了家务牵累，先后走上了生产劳动和社会服务工作的岗位。她们在党的领导和职工群众的热烈赞助下，陆续建成十八个初具规模的工厂，其中有生产比较复杂产品的仪器厂、玻璃厂、化工厂，也有生产日用品的木制品厂、席箔厂、缝纫厂；有三十多人的浆糊厂到五百多人的塑料厂，也有新近组织起来的综合工厂。综合工厂内有“大集中生产”、“小集中生产”和“分散生产小组”。随着食堂、托儿组织的增加和扩大，许多原来分散生产的家庭妇女，最近也摆脱开家务劳动，分别集中在工厂和家庭附近的小组里去生产。少数家有病人、本人身体不很好、家务拖累特别繁重，但又愿意参加一些劳动的人，也初步组织了起来，在综合工厂的统一管理下，把活领回家去做。这些工厂在为大工业服务、为人民生活服务和为城市建设服务的方针指导下，生产有了很大发展，1958年下半年产值是三十一万多元，1959年全年上升到八百五十多万元，今年第一季度又跃进到一千二百六十多万元，超过去年全年48.7％。一年半以来，社办工厂积累增加到近一百四十万元，并从积累中拨款增添各种设备四百三十七台，其中有车床、刨床、铣床、冲床和电子热合机等，在白手起家的情况下，自己武装自己。
    这个公社所办的工厂，在生产上都具有灵活多样的特点，在生产领域中部分地起着“拾遗补缺”的作用，同时在为大工业加工的过程中，不断提高技术，生产出一部分比较高级的产品。现在全公社的产品已由去年的七十一种，增加到一百五十九种。其中有玻璃制品、绝缘材料、染色、布卷尺等四十多种产品，都是大工厂和较大工厂下放给他们生产的，这样就使公社工厂得到更加迅速发展的机会，大工厂或较大工厂也能够腾出手来，生产更多高级的产品。全市闻名的一得阁墨汁厂，去年把浆糊产品交给公社浆糊厂生产后，使自己节省了十四间厂房，腾出十八个劳动力，现已有十五种广告色、七种化妆色和三十种水彩的新产品先后试制成功和投入生产。国营兴华染料厂第三车间把多年生产的“爱耳染色”产品全部交给公社化工厂生产后，自己改产高级染料，在不增加工人、设备的情况下，完成了生产跃进计划，去年的生产总值较前年增加了十多倍。随着生产事业的大发展，这些工厂需要社办工厂加工的项目越来越多，因此就更加积极地在技术上予以支援，同时在等价交换的原则下，帮助社办工厂解决一些生产设备。兴华染料厂和公社化工厂在生产上发生联系后，帮助公社化工厂解决了生产技术等问题，使公社生产的“爱耳染色”的产量迅速增加，除满足了北京市场的需要外，还行销华北一些城镇。现在，在北京市场上，从日用杂货商店出售的小孩尿布、鸡毛掸子，到王府井百货大楼出售的塑料手提包、玻璃扣，都有这个公社的产品。厂房分散在四条胡同的公社塑料厂，在所生产的产品中，有价值十多元一件的塑料雨衣、防护服，也有只值几分钱到一角多钱的证件夹、糖果袋。市场需要什么，她们就生产什么，不单纯追求产值。最近，她们又根据市场的需要试制出塑料药瓶、塑料钮扣等新产品。最近在生产组基础上组成的两个综合工厂，几乎全是为市场迫切需要加工的业务服务。
    椿树公社的建立，有着深厚的思想基础和物质基础，它是在全民整风运动和社会主义建设大跃进中诞生的。这里的居民（主要是家庭妇女）在1958年参加了伟大的整风运动后，思想觉悟空前提高，劳动光荣、不劳动可耻的思想深入人心。在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，为了迅速摆脱我国一穷二白的落后状况，同时也把自己从家务琐事中解放出来，她们提出了“为社会主义添砖添瓦”的口号，迫切要求参加生产劳动。这时，由于社会主义建设的高速度发展，各厂矿企业为了求得更大更好的跃进，也希望有人能为他们进行一些辅助性的劳动，以至直接为他们生产一些比较次要的产品，一个家庭妇女走出家门参加社会主义建设的革命风暴，就由此乘势而起。在这个革命风暴中，居民中的积极分子和有迫切就业要求的劳动妇女走在运动的前列。她们在街道党组织的领导下，充分发扬了穷干苦干的精神，因地制宜、因陋就简、自力更生，从平地办起工厂。西椿树胡同一带有九个职工家属，她们向街坊借来两个风箱、两口旧锅，拣些碎砖头，苦战一夜，在一个大院里搭起两个炉灶，大家又凑起两元四角钱买些口罩和手套，从附近一个制钉厂拉回洗过洋钉的废硫酸，从机械厂拉回一些废铁屑，就这样成立了一个小小化工厂。西草厂二百多名家庭妇女利用一座年久失修无人居住的破屋，冒着雨，拉土、运砖、砌案台，大战三天，办起了装订厂和玩具厂。她们折书页、作玩具，用废硫酸和铁屑熬成硫酸亚铁，得到加工费后就用来添置设备和购买原料，不断扩大再生产。她们的亲人中凡有一技之长的，也都纷纷利用业余时间，帮助她们克服困难，技术人员给她们画图设计，土木工人帮助修缮厂房。由于在生产上和国营工厂发生了联系，许多工厂除按价调拨一些下脚料或一些废料给她们作原料外，并派科室人员帮助她们建立企业管理制度，派出老工人来给她们传授技术，或者让她们到工厂去学习。通过这些办法，很快就培养出一批“技术骨干”。这批“技术骨干”又转过来把生产技术迅速传授给更多的人。许多工厂就这样从无到有，从小到大，从分散到集中，迅速地成长起来。九个妇女办起来的小小化工厂，现在已经是一个有近三百名工人的工厂，每月能生产四、五十万元产值的产品。生产事业的扩大和发展，吸引着愈来愈多的妇女走上生产岗位。
    家庭妇女赤手空拳闹生产，开始时在这个地区被当作“奇闻”。有人怕妇女们因烧饭、带孩子等家务琐事拖住后腿，坚持不下去。这时，党组织就出来长她们的志气：“能够自力更生办厂，为什么不能自力更生办集体生活福利事业！”妇女们就办起了最初的公共食堂和托儿组织。由于它是为生产服务，并和生产事业有密切的联系，所以它具有强大的生命力。随着生产的发展和积累的增加，公社的集体生活福利和社会服务事业也越办越好。公社在生产发展的基础上，从生产出发，由积累中拨出一部分款项，补助集体福利事业的兴办。现在这个公社在统一管理下，已办起一个以公共食堂为中心的生活服务网。食堂以大带小，在三个大食堂周围分布着二十个中小食堂，许多托儿所、幼儿园内也都附有儿童食堂，入伙人数已达五千一百多人。大食堂不仅利用炊事机械的能力为周围的一些中小食堂加工主食，在食堂附近还设立了洗衣房、淋浴室和蒸馏间，充分利用蒸汽锅炉的废蒸汽、废热水，洗衣服、供淋浴和制蒸馏水，做到“一物多用”，使食堂的收入大大增加，为进一步改善伙食提供了条件。公社在居民住宅和工厂附近设立了七十六个托儿所、幼儿园和哺乳室，共收托了三千四百八十多个孩子。被称为全市红旗单位的四川营托儿所，从去年11月到今年2月，全所一百多个孩子每月每人平均增加体重一市斤。通过对保育人员上政治课、文化课和离职轮训、到市立托儿所学习等办法，迅速建立起了一支思想比较进步、初步掌握业务和有一定文化的保育人员队伍，并且大力支援了新建托儿所、幼儿园。现在全社的托儿组织都在向它看齐。此外，在大街小巷还遍布着二十多个生活服务站，把许多家庭的零星家务劳动担当了起来。
    随着生产的发展和社会服务事业的不断改进，也有力地推动了公社文教、卫生等项事业的全面跃进。现在全社已兴办了十六所业余学校，开设了八十七个班级，参加学习的生产人员达一千三百多人。公社还办了一所医院和两所医疗保健站。社员的经济收入也有了相应的提高。除了集体福利事业得到公社的补助以外，参加生产人员的平均月工资已由开始时的八、九元增加到现在的二十三元。
    妇女参加生产和集体生活后，精神面貌已开始发生变化，她们的家庭和社会地位都有了显著提高，新型的民主、和睦、平等、互助和有着共同奋斗目标的幸福家庭更多地出现了。五个孩子的妈妈栾耀奎参加生产以前，她的丈夫认为她只能做家务事。家里来个客人，栾耀奎插一句话，她丈夫就说：“你懂得什么，看孩子去吧！”栾耀奎参加生产后，连续被选为红旗手，当了工段长，出席了北京市群英会。现在，丈夫对她很尊敬，已变成互爱互助的好夫妻。妇女们的政治思想觉悟和领导管理能力也有了很大提高。现在全社已有八名街道妇女光荣地参加了中国共产党，有一百七十名妇女担任厂长、车间主任和公共食堂、托儿组织、服务站的负责人，还有一百多人被评选为北京市和宣武区的先进生产者、先进工作者和“三八”红旗手。为了进一步培养和提高基层领导骨干，公社党委专门为妇女积极分子上党课和政治课。现在听党课的人数已由去年的二十多人增加到二百多人。
    这个公社最近举行了社员代表大会，总结了建社一年半以来的各项工作，选出了新的管理委员会，制定了1960年跃进规划。大会提出，当前的任务，是要继续发展生产和办好集体福利事业，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，使公社从政治上、经济上、组织上进一步得到巩固和提高。根据规划，今年公社工业的总产值、全员劳动生产率、产品的质量等方面都要有很大的提高和增长。主要措施是：加强生产管理，做好安全生产，大力开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，争取年底以前在集中生产的工厂中基本上实现机械化、半机械化。大会对全面组织人民经济生活，举办文教卫生事业等方面，也做了具体规定。在社员代表大会以后，全社已掀起一个新的生产高潮，生产面貌天天翻新，新产品不断出现。参加工厂、食堂、托儿组织、服务站的生产服务人员，也都以实际行动贯彻执行大会的精神，决心在生产建设、文教卫生和集体生活福利事业等方面，力争全面跃进。
