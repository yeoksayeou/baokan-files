Comrades Chairman and fellow Committee Members:

    I fully endorse the "Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" report made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council, the "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft" by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I also concur with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the CPPCC National Committee.

    Over the past year, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have adhered to the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and launched a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, thereby overfulfilling the 1959 national economic plan. The results of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward have enabled our country to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the Chinese people. Facts tell us that China's national economy can maintain a long-term leap forward development speed, and in the high-speed development of the Great Leap Forward, it is possible to maintain appropriate proportional relationships in a planned way. I believe that the "Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" proposed by the State Council is a plan for continued leap forward, and it will definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

    With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the vigorous development of the People's Communes, our health work, like other socialist construction undertakings, has also made remarkable achievements. In terms of eliminating diseases, due to the strengthening of Party leadership, adherence to putting politics in command, close integration with production, vigorously engaging in mass movements, and implementing a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies combining Chinese and Western medicine, and indigenous and foreign methods, the five major parasitic diseases that most seriously endanger the health of Chinese farmers—schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria, and kala-azar—have been brought under control, reduced in scope, and eliminated respectively, thereby protecting the labor force, increasing labor attendance rates and labor efficiency, and strongly supporting agricultural production. I would now like to report to the conference on the elimination of kala-azar.

    Kala-azar is a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies, prevalent in the vast rural areas north of the Yangtze River, affecting fifteen provinces and regions, with Shandong being the most severely affected. Before liberation, Chinese farmers suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of reactionary rule, living lives worse than animals. Once infected with kala-azar, most were unable to receive treatment, resulting in the rapid spread and high mortality of this disease. After liberation, due to the infinite concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the suffering of the masses, vigorous prevention and treatment were carried out. In the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) promulgated in 1956, kala-azar was listed as one of the diseases to be eliminated within a limited time. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party, we have carried out a series of investigations and studies, mobilized the masses, universally conducted treatment, and taken measures to eliminate sandflies with emphasis, so that the number of patients has decreased year by year, and in 1958, we achieved the victory of basically eliminating kala-azar nationwide. In 1959, under the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we continued to fight against kala-azar and achieved new successes. According to a survey in Shandong Province, the average incidence rate of kala-azar in 1950 was as high as 350 per 100,000 people. By 1958, it had dropped to 3.5 per 100,000, and in 1959 it was only 1.3 per 100,000, a decrease of 99.6% compared to 1950. Looking at the prevalence of kala-azar, before liberation, kala-azar occurred in more than half of the villages in Shandong, while now patients can only be found in 0.7% of the villages. Kala-azar has disappeared in the vast majority of villages. At the same time, due to the development of mass scientific research and technical innovation movements, and the implementation of the policy of combining Chinese and Western medicine, and indigenous and foreign methods, we created a therapy combining acupuncture and moxibustion with antimony preparations, further solving the problem of treating drug-resistant kala-azar. In addition, we discovered that several Chinese herbal medicines and wild plants have the effect of killing sandfly larvae, which made us further realize that traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a great treasure house. In order to better carry out pest elimination and disease prevention work, we must give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine.

    Although we have made some achievements, there is still a certain distance from the Party's requirements for us, and there are still some problems in our work. Mainly because the infectious source of kala-azar has not been completely eliminated, and the sandflies that transmit kala-azar have not been completely eradicated, there are still a few new infections occurring, indicating that the transmission of kala-azar has not been completely controlled. If we are satisfied with the existing achievements and become complacent, there is still a danger of spread and development. Therefore, we must continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, overcome right-leaning complacency, advance victoriously, and strive to eradicate kala-azar by 1960. We deeply feel that in the process of eliminating diseases, the closer we get to the final stage, the more complex and difficult the work becomes. In order to ensure the completion of the task, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, guide our work with the spirit of continuous revolution, mobilize the masses more deeply and extensively, persist in repeated struggles, and never give up until complete elimination. In areas that have already been eliminated, we must also actively carry out prevention work, and enable the knowledge and technology of preventing and treating kala-azar to take root among the masses and among local health workers, so as to take regular measures to prevent its resurgence.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun emphasized in his report that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and accelerating the development of agriculture and conscientiously implementing the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program is the central link in the high-speed and proportionate development of China's socialist planned economy. Therefore, he requires that all departments such as industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health should regard supporting agriculture as their important task. We health workers must actively respond to this call. In addition to further developing and improving rural health work and conscientiously doing a good job in the health work of the People's Communes, we must, under the leadership of the local Party committees, more deeply and extensively mobilize the masses, strengthen technical guidance, and continue to carry out the vigorous patriotic health movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eliminate major diseases, so as to strive to complete the tasks of pest elimination and disease prevention stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    发动群众消灭黑热病
    王兆俊委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护国务院李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并同意政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席所作的政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    一年来，我国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，坚持了总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三个法宝，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，因而超额完成了1959年的国民经济计划。两年来连续大跃进的结果，已使我国提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这是我国人民的伟大胜利。事实告诉我们，我国国民经济是能够长期保持跃进的发展速度的，而且在大跃进的高速度发展中，一样可以有计划地保持适当的比例关系。我认为国务院提出的1960年国民经济计划草案是一个继续跃进的计划草案，是一定能够完成和超额完成的。
    随着工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社的蓬勃发展，我们卫生工作，也和其他社会主义建设事业一样，作出了显著成绩。就消灭疾病来说，由于加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，紧密结合生产，大搞群众运动，实行中西结合、土洋并举等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，对危害我国农民健康最严重的血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾、黑热病等五大寄生虫病，已分别做到控制、缩小和消灭，从而保护了劳动力，提高了劳动出勤率和劳动效率，有力地支援了农业生产。我现在愿将消灭黑热病的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    黑热病是由白蛉子所传播的一种寄生虫病，流行于长江以北的广大农村中，波及十五个省区，以山东为最严重。解放前，我国农民遭受着反动统治的残酷压迫与剥削，过着牛马不如的生活，一旦染上了黑热病，大都得不到治疗，结果造成了这一病灾的迅速蔓延和高度的死亡。解放后，由于党中央和毛主席对群众疾苦的无限关怀，大力进行防治，并在1956年公布的全国农业发展纲要（草案）中，把黑热病列为限期消灭的疾病之一。几年来，我们在党的正确领导下，开展了一系列的调查研究，发动群众，普遍进行治疗，并有重点地采取了扑灭白蛉子的措施，使患病人数逐年下降，至1958年取得了在全国范围内基本上消灭黑热病的胜利。1959年我们在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜下，向黑热病继续作斗争，又取得了新的成就。根据山东省的调查，在1950年黑热病的平均患病率高达十万分之三百五十，至1958年已降到十万分之三点五，1959年仅为十万分之一点三，比1950年减少了99.6％。再从黑热病的流行范围来看，解放前在山东半数以上的村庄内都有黑热病发生，而目前只有在0.7％的村庄内能查见病人，在绝大多数的村庄里黑热病已告绝迹。同时由于展开了群众性的科学研究和技术革新运动，贯彻执行了中西结合、土洋并举的方针，我们创用了针炙合并锑剂疗法，进一步解决了抗药性黑热病的治疗问题，此外并发现几种中药和野生植物具有杀灭白蛉幼虫的功效，使我们进一步认识到，祖国医学确是一个伟大的宝库，为了更好地开展除害灭病工作，必须充分发挥中医中药的作用。
    我们虽然做出一些成绩，但与党对我们的要求尚有一定的距离，工作中也还存在着一些问题。主要由于黑热病的传染病源还没有能够完全肃清，传播黑热病的白蛉子尚未扑灭干净，目前仍有少数新的感染发生，表明黑热病的传播还没有被彻底控制，如果我们满足于既有的成绩而麻痹大意，仍有蔓延发展的危险。因此必须继续贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议精神，克服右倾松劲情绪，乘胜前进，争取在1960年达到根除黑热病之目的。我们深深感到，在消灭疾病的过程中，愈到最后阶段，工作愈加复杂艰巨。为了保证任务的完成，必须紧紧依靠党的领导，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，以不断革命的精神来指导工作，更深入广泛地发动群众，坚持反复斗争，不彻底消灭，决不罢休。在已经消灭的地区，也还要积极进行预防工作，并使防治黑热病的知识和技术在群众中生根，在当地卫生人员中生根，以便采取经常性的措施，防其死灰复燃。
    李富春副总理在报告中强调指出，农业是国民经济的基础，加快农业的发展，认真地贯彻实行农业发展纲要四十条，是高速度、按比例地发展我国社会主义计划经济的中心环节，因此要求工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化卫生等各个部门都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务。我们卫生工作人员，必须积极响应这一号召，除应进一步发展和提高农村卫生工作，认真做好人民公社的卫生工作外，必须在各地党委的领导下，更深入广泛地发动群众，加强技术指导，继续开展轰轰烈烈除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的爱国卫生运动，为提前完成全国农业发展纲要中所规定的除害灭病任务而奋斗。
