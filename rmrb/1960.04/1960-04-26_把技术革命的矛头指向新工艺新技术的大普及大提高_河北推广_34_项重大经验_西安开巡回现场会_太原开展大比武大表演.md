Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 25th: More than two million workers in Hebei Province are comprehensively and systematically promoting 34 major advanced experiences of universal significance, triggering a massive production upsurge sweeping across cities and towns throughout the province.

Since the beginning of this year, thousands upon thousands of innovation creations and advanced experiences have emerged on the industrial and transportation fronts in Hebei Province. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, these advanced experiences have been evaluated, selected, summarized, exchanged, inspected, and compared through countless on-site meetings, technical demonstrations, and production sports meets. This has combined large and small experiences, indigenous and foreign experiences, and local and external experiences to form complete and integrated systems. Thirty-four major advanced experiences were selected, including hot blast stoves in the iron and steel industry, "unmanned coal mining faces" and shield support coal mining methods in the coal industry, automatic production lines for iron mold casting in the machinery industry, and automatic doffing, warp tying, four-in-one ring power supply, and coal gasification in the textile industry. In order to ensure that these advanced experiences blossom and bear fruit universally, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has set deadlines for their widespread promotion before "May Day" and "July 1st" respectively. In Tianjin, more than 130,000 textile workers mobilized fully, and through seven days of hard work and ingenuity, comprehensively promoted a set of advanced experiences such as shredding and even spreading, and automatic doffing and warp tying, creating and transforming more than 6,500 sets (pieces) of indigenous and foreign equipment and tools, breaking through the weak links of manual operation and liberating more than 20,000 workers from heavy labor. Large and small factories and mines in Shijiazhuang have formed shock teams to promote coal gasification. By mid-April, more than 19,000 coal gasifiers had been built, and eight counties including Hengshui and Shulu in this area had achieved coal gasification ahead of schedule. A new coal mining method pioneered by Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine – "unmanned coal mining face" – has been promoted in eighteen working faces of Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxing, Handan and other four major mining bureaus for more than a month, increasing output and work efficiency by more than double.

In the process of promoting major experiences, many factory and mine workers have also carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and supplemented and modified them in light of the specific conditions of their units, making these advanced experiences more perfect. For example, the experience of continuous production of more than 20 processes such as washing, printing, desizing, and cloth folding at the Tianjin Yongxing Printing and Dyeing Factory, which has been promoted in the printing and dyeing industry throughout the province, has now been improved. Originally, the electrical automatic control console could only control the first few processes. After improvements by Xintai, Huada, and Yida dyeing factories, it has developed to be able to control the entire factory's production processes, realizing automatic control of continuous production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 25th: The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a mobile on-site meeting attended by 110,000 workers to conduct a mass inspection, summary, popularization, and improvement of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

The General Headquarters of Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution in Xi'an divided the 110,000 workers participating in the meeting into ten fronts: state-owned machinery, local machinery, light industry and handicrafts, building materials, chemical industry, basic construction, transportation, textiles, finance and trade, and county and district industries. Each front formed representative teams composed of leading cadres, workers, and technicians according to different types of work. At the on-site meeting, they observed and discussed simultaneously. If they found an innovative experience suitable for their factory, they would collectively study and decide to learn and promote it on the spot, so that the innovation project of one factory could blossom and bear fruit in many factories in a short period of time. For example, the forgers of the Xi'an Boiler Factory and the Xi'an Railway Bureau Vehicle Depot had made many efforts to get rid of sledgehammers and realize mechanized production in the technical innovation movement, but they had not succeeded. At the mobile on-site meeting, they learned the experience of the forgers of the Baqiao Farm Tool Factory in realizing mechanization with indigenous methods, and after returning to the factory, they realized forging mechanization in only three days and nights. At the same time, the workers spread their own experiences to the units being visited, both gaining knowledge and giving treasures. The workers of the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Machinery Factory discovered at the meeting that the indigenous coal gasifier newly made by the Sanqiao Vehicle Factory could not produce gas, and immediately sent engineers and workers to spread advanced experience, so that the indigenous coal gasifier of the Sanqiao Vehicle Factory was quickly put into production.

People's Daily, Taiyuan, April 25th: Taiyuan City uses the forms of training, competition, and performance to conduct mass summaries and promotions of innovations and creations. A large number of new machines and advanced experiences are gradually systematized and completed through comparison and identification, and universally blossom and bear fruit.

Taiyuan City's approach to workers' grand training, grand competition, and grand performance is: when each unit has an innovation or creation, it first conducts local training to master the technology; then it is taken to the whole factory and the whole city for grand competition; advanced experiences are discovered and selected from the competition, and then matched into sets; and then systematically promoted through performances. Since the beginning of this year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized ten city-wide competitions and performances by industry and type of work based on the training and competition in various factories and mines. These include electric furnaces and small blast furnace gasifiers in the smelting industry, forging and casting in the machinery industry, earthwork and bricklaying in the construction industry, and loading and unloading and cooking utensil reforms. Through competitions and performances, the city's rolling steel system summarized and promoted 26 advanced experiences, including the experience of mechanization of coal gas beating carbon transportation created by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Third Rolling Mill, and the coal burning experience of the First Rolling Mill, so that the entire production process of the city's rolling steel system, from feeding, coal burning, steel burning, and steel feeding to rolling into finished products, had a set of advanced operating methods. When Jinxi Machinery Factory promoted the forging mechanization experience summarized by Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and other units, the workers went further. In addition to maintaining the original advantages of being able to move up and down, the air hammer forging table they manufactured can also move left and right, making the operating efficiency even higher. The Design Department of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory carried out technical innovation on a large scale and realized mechanization in design, drawing, and other aspects. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized responsible cadres and technicians from various factories and mines in the city to hold a competition and performance competition here, so that the functional departments of the city made a big leap forward in close cooperation with the technical innovation movement.

    把技术革命的矛头指向新工艺新技术的大普及大提高
    河北推广34项重大经验
    西安开巡回现场会　太原开展大比武大表演
    河北
    据新华社天津25日电　河北省二百多万职工整行整业地推广三十四项具有普遍意义的重大先进经验，一个生产特大高潮急剧地席卷全省大小城镇。
    今年以来，河北省工业、交通战线涌现出成千上万件革新创造和先进经验。各地在党委领导下，通过无数次的现场会议、技术表演、生产运动会等形式，对这些先进经验进行鉴定、选型、总结交流、检阅、评比，使大经验和小经验、土经验和洋经验、本地经验和外地经验相结合，配套成龙，选出了钢铁行业的热风化，煤炭行业的“无人采煤工作面”、掩护支架采煤法，机械行业的铁模铸造自动生产线，纺织行业的自动落纱、接经和四合一环形供电、煤气化等三十四项重大先进经验。中共河北省委为使这些先进经验全面开花，普遍结果，分别限期在“五一”、“七一”以前普遍推广。天津市的十三万多名纺织工人，全体总动员，经过七天的大干巧干，就全面推广了撕碎铺匀、自动落纱、接经等一套先进经验，创制和改造了各种土洋设备和工具六千五百多台（件），突破了手工操作的薄弱环节，有二万多名工人摆脱了笨重劳动。石家庄市大小厂矿纷纷组成推行煤气化突击队，到4月中旬，已经建成煤气炉一万九千多座，这个地区的衡水、束鹿等八个县提前实现了煤气化。开滦赵各庄矿首创的一种新的采煤方法——“无人采煤工作面”，一个多月来，已经在开滦、峰峰、井陉、邯郸等四大矿务局的十八个工作面上推广，产量、工效提高一倍以上。
    在重大经验的推广过程中，许多厂矿职工还发扬不断革命精神，结合本单位的具体情况，加以补充修改，使这些先进经验更加完善。如已经在全省印染行业推广的天津永兴印染厂洗、印、退浆、迭布等二十多道工序连续化生产的经验，现又得到了提高。原来，电气自动操纵台只能控制前几道工序，经过信泰、华大和义大染厂的改进，发展到能控制全厂生产工序，使连续化生产实现了自动控制。
    西安
    据新华社西安25日电　中共西安市委最近召开了有十一万职工参加的流动巡回现场会议，对技术革新和技术革命运动进行群众性的大检查、大总结、大普及、大提高。
    西安市技术革新和技术革命总指挥部把参加会议的十一万职工，分成国营机械、地方机械、轻工手工、建筑材料、化工、基本建设、交通运输、纺织、财贸、县区工业等十条战线，每条战线又按不同工种分别组成了领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的代表队。在现场会议上，随看随议，发现有适合本厂的革新经验，经过集体研究，当场就决定学习和推广，使一个厂的革新项目短期内就可以在很多工厂开花结果。例如西安锅炉厂和西安铁路局车辆段的锻工，在技术革新运动中，为丢掉大锤实现机械化生产，曾经作了很多努力，但是没有成功。他们在巡回现场会议中，学习了坝桥农具厂锻工用土办法实现机械化的经验，回厂后只用了三昼夜的时间就实现了锻工机械化。职工们同时将自己的经验传播给被参观的单位，既取了经，又送了宝。陕西省建筑机械厂职工在会议中发现三桥车辆厂新制成的土煤气炉出不了煤气，立即派工程师和工人去传播先进经验，使三桥车辆厂的土煤气炉很快投入生产。
    太原
    本报太原25日电  太原市通过练武、比武、表演的形式，对革新创造开展群众性的大总结、大推广。大批新机具和先进经验经过比较、鉴定，逐步系统化、完整化，并且普遍开花结果。
    太原市职工大练武、大比武、大表演的作法是：各单位有了革新创造先就地练武，掌握技术；然后拿到全厂、全市大比武；从比武中发现和选拔出先进经验，并配成套；接着再通过表演，系统地推广。今年以来，中共太原市委在各厂矿企业练武、比武的基础上，按产业、工种组织了十次全市规模的比武表演。其中有冶炼业的电炉、小高炉煤气炉，机械业的锻造、铸造，建筑业的土方、瓦工和装卸、炊具改革等。全市轧钢系统通过比武表演，总结、推广了太钢第三轧钢厂创造的煤气打炭运输机械化的经验，第一轧钢厂的烧煤经验等二十六项先进经验，使全市轧钢系统以上料、烧煤、烧钢、喂钢到轧钢成材整个生产过程有了一套先进操作方法。晋西机器厂在推行太原矿山机器厂等单位总结出来的锻造机械化经验时，工人们还百尺竿头更进一步。他们制造的气锤锻造台除保持了原来能上下的优点外，还能左右活动，使操作效率更加提高。太原重型机器厂设计科大搞技术革新，在设计、绘图等方面实现了机械化。中共太原市委组织全市各厂矿企业负责干部和技术人员在这里举行了比武表演赛，使全市职能科室在紧密配合技术革新运动方面向前跃进了一大步。
