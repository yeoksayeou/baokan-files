    Tea Factory Technical Innovation Vanguards
    Two Fujian Tea Factories Achieve Production Automation and Semi-Automation From Native Methods
    (Our report) The state-owned Fuzhou Tea Factory in Fujian Province has used indigenous methods to manufacture automated equipment, leaping from manual operation to achieving production automation and semi-automation.
    The Fuzhou Tea Factory is one of the three major jasmine tea factories in China, processing and refining more than 160 kinds of jasmine tea of various grades that are well-known at home and abroad. The process is very complex and requires a lot of manpower. In order to improve the working conditions of workers and realize a great leap forward in tea processing and production, as early as the autumn of 1958, the factory's Party committee actively led workers to carry out a mechanization and semi-mechanization campaign. By the beginning of 1959, some workers in the factory had been freed from manual operations. Later, with a spirit of continuous revolution, they used indigenous methods and materials to manufacture automated machinery and equipment, marching towards overall mechanization and automation and semi-automation. Now, the factory's production has jumped from more than 80% manual operation in the past to 96% of workers engaged in mechanized and automated, semi-automated production. The total number of employees in the factory has decreased by 72% compared with the past, but work efficiency has increased by one to hundreds of times; the quality of tea has also been further improved, becoming a national jasmine tea quality standard factory.
    Now, when people walk into the Fuzhou Tea Factory, they will see rows of wooden-laddered machines in strings, with motors roaring and conveyor belts turning left and right. Raw tea materials are sent into various machines for processing and refining, and finally, fragrant jasmine tea automatically flows from the bagging machine into wooden boxes, which are pushed into the warehouse by rubber-wheeled vehicles. Hundreds of manual operations in the tea-making process have been replaced by a complete automatic production line and four semi-automatic production lines for flower picking, flower sifting, baking, scenting, flower removal, blending, and bagging.
    The series of automatic production lines manufactured by the employees of the Fuzhou Tea Factory using indigenous methods are mostly made of bamboo and wood structures. These machines are easy to repair and operate, low in cost, and highly efficient. For example, the wooden flat sieve machine made by the workers themselves is light and flexible. Only one wooden support and one horsepower of power can drive it, but the tea screening efficiency is equal to that of an iron-shell flat sieve machine that requires seven horsepower to drive. Another example is the wooden flower picking machine, which costs only a few dozen yuan per unit, but its work efficiency is 120 times higher than manual picking. The employees also used indigenous methods and materials to create a plastic electrostatic tea sorting machine based on the principle that insulating materials can generate static electricity after friction.
    After the factory realized production automation and semi-automation, more than 2,000 workers who were liberated from manual operations were transferred to new production positions according to their technical expertise. A comprehensive utilization workshop was added to the factory, absorbing a large number of former tea-making workers to manufacture new varieties such as "compressed tea" to meet the tea needs of ethnic minorities. A tea machinery repair and manufacturing workshop has also been added to expand the production of tea machinery and support the mechanization of rural rough tea processing.
    Furthermore, the employees of the Fujian Provincial State-owned Mindong No. 1 Tea Refining Factory, in the midst of a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, used indigenous methods to achieve full automation of refined tea production, saving 75% of labor and increasing tea-making efficiency by 21.8 times compared with the past.
    The Mindong No. 1 Tea Factory is one of the refined tea factories of the famous "Tanyang Gongfu" black tea, which has always been known for its complex and varied manual operations, hence the name "Gongfu tea." Since the establishment of the factory, although a batch of processing machinery and equipment has been added successively, 93% of the labor is still manual operation. In order to quickly change this backward state, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, all the employees of the factory launched a technical revolution movement of "everyone engaged in innovation, everyone acting as an expert." They used wood, bamboo, scrap copper, scrap iron, and purchased some electronic tubes, electric meters, enameled wires, silicon steel sheets, and other equipment, and successively manufactured 28 electrostatic stem suction machines, spiral tea cutting machines, and other mechanical equipment, realizing full automation of production.

    At the Fuzhou Tea Factory, in the past, the magnolia flowers used for tea blending were manually separated and sifted after entering the factory, requiring 200 people to process them every day. Now, only one person is needed to manage the automatic flower selecting and separating machine. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Hou Minjie photo)

### 茶厂技术革新的急先锋  福建两茶厂土中出洋实现生产自动化半自动化

    茶厂技术革新的急先锋
    福建两茶厂土中出洋实现生产自动化半自动化
    本报讯　福建省国营福州茶厂用土办法制造自动化设备，从手工操作一跃实现生产自动化、半自动化。
    福州茶厂是我国精制花茶的三大花茶厂之一，加工精制一百六十多种名闻国内外的各级花茶，工艺过程十分复杂，要花费大量人工。为了改善工人的劳动条件，实现茶叶加工生产大跃进，早在1958年秋季，这个厂的党委就积极领导工人开展机械化、半机械化运动。到1959年初，全厂已有部分工人从手工操作中解放出来。后来，他们又以不断革命的精神，用土办法、土器材制造自动化机器设备，向全盘机械化和自动化、半自动化进军。现在，全厂生产已由过去80％以上是手工操作，跃为96％的工人从事机械化和自动化、半自动化生产。全厂职工人数比过去减少了72％，工效却提高了一倍到上百倍；茶叶质量也进一步提高，成为全国花茶质量标准厂。
    现在，当人们走进福州茶厂时，就会看见一台台木制梯列机器成串成龙，马达轰鸣，输送带左转右绕。把毛茶原料送进各种机器加工精制，最后浓香扑鼻的花香茶从装箱机中自动流进木箱装好，由胶轮车推进仓库。制茶过程中成百道手工操作的工序，被整胚自动作业线和采花、筛花、烘焙、窨花裨花、匀堆装箱等四条半自动作业线所代替。
    福州茶厂职工用土办法制造出来的一系列自动作业线，绝大部分机器都是竹木结构的。这些机器都具有容易修制和操作、成本低廉、效率高等特点。例如工人自己制造的木质平筛机，轻巧灵活，只要一支木支柱，一马力的动力就能带动起来，而筛茶效率却和要七马力才能带动起来的铁壳平筛机相等。又如木质采花机，每部只需几十元的成本，但工效却比人工采摘高一百二十倍。职工们还用土办法、土器材，根据绝缘材料经过磨擦能发生静电的原理，创造成功一台塑料静电拣茶机。
    这个厂实现生产自动化、半自动化以后，从手工操作解放出来的两千多工人，都根据他们的技术特长，输送到新的生产岗位。厂内新增了综合利用车间，吸收大批原先的制茶工人，制造新品种“紧压茶”等，满足少数民族用茶需要。还新增了一个制茶机械修造车间，扩大制茶机械的生产，支援农村毛茶粗制实现机械化。
    又讯　福建省国营闽东第一茶叶精制厂职工，在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中，用土办法实现精制茶叶生产全程自动化，节省劳动力75％，制茶工效比过去提高二十一点八倍。
    闽东第一茶厂是闻名中外的“坦洋工夫”红茶的精制茶厂之一，历来就以手工操作纷纭复杂著称，故有“工夫茶”之称。建厂以来，虽然先后添置了一批加工机械设备，但仍有93％的劳动仍为手工操作。为了迅速改变这种落后状态，全厂职工在厂党委领导下，掀起了一个“个个搞革新、人人当专家”的技术革命运动。他们利用木材、竹子、废铜、废铁，购买了部分电子管、电表、漆包线、矽钢片等器材，先后制造了二十八部静电吸梗机、螺旋式切茶机等机械设备，实现了生产全程自动化。（附图片）
