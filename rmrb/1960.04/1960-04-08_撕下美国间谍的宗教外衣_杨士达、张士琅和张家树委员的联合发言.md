We wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the National Committee of the CPPCC Standing Committee. From these reports, we see the flourishing and continuously leaping forward face of the motherland. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people will rely on their own nimble hands and infinite wisdom to transform society, transform the world, and rapidly build the motherland into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, so that the people of the whole country can live a peaceful and happy life.

No matter how Hull howls, he cannot exonerate the crimes confessed by the veteran spy, Harold Rigney.

But as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "...imperialist elements and enemy agents often adopt conspiratorial means in an attempt to undermine our socialist construction..." The recent public trial in the Shanghai Municipal Intermediate People's Court of American spy Harold Rigney and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group under his command is a clear example of the consistent attempts by US imperialism to subvert the people's democratic power in China. On the same day that this American imperialist spy Rigney was sentenced (March 18 of this year), US Secretary of State Hull issued a shameless "statement" clamoring that "Bishop Rigney is an 'innocent American citizen' whose only mission is purely religious," attempting to cover up Rigney's crimes. Iron facts prove that Harold Rigney is a heinous American spy whose criminal activities have harmed the interests of our country and people (including Catholic friends). His lurking in China has no religious "mission" whatsoever, but only political conspiracies to subvert our regime. US imperialism also lodged a "protest" with our Ambassador Wang Bingnan, attempting to deny the crimes of the American spy. Ambassador Wang sternly rejected its "protest" and solemnly pointed out that it sent spies to our country to carry out subversive activities, and we have the right to protest to it. Let us uncover the religious cloak of this American spy to see if he has any religiosity. No matter how Hull howls, he cannot exonerate the specific crimes that this veteran spy himself confessed.

When the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime was tottering, the US imperialists sent Rigney to China to instigate anti-communism.

When the Chinese people's revolution achieved revolutionary victory in 1948, US imperialism saw that the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique was tottering, so it sent American imperialist elements to engage in subversive activities. The notorious Catholic Cardinal Spellman brought the veteran spy Rigney to our country, maintaining close contact with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. Using activities such as "speeches" and "prayers," he instigated anti-communism and encouraged Chiang Kai-shek's "suppression of rebellion" war. At the same time, under the guise of "inspecting church affairs," he collected confidential information about our liberated areas and actively planned "contingency" deployments. After Spellman left, Rigney was approved by the Vatican to stay in China. Together with the Vatican "Minister" to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, the imperialist element Liberi, he organized the "Catholic Central Bureau" and served as its secretary-general. This Catholic Central Bureau was an organization used by US imperialism to subvert our people's democratic power under the guise of religion. Rigney used this reactionary organization to lead and support the person in charge of the subordinate "Huaming News Agency," Zhai Guanghua (American nationality), the person in charge of the "Labor Law Department," Tian Zhizhong, the assistant of the "Cultural Activities Department," Tian Wanglin, member Hou Zhizheng and other imperialist elements and counter-revolutionaries to actively collect our country's military, political, and economic intelligence. After the liberation of Shanghai, in order to covertly carry out his espionage activities, Rigney changed the Huaming News Agency to "Congregation Family Communication," and collected our military, political, and economic intelligence through correspondents in various parishes, and sent it to Washington, USA, and the Vatican.

Rigney organized the reactionary "Legion of Mary" to subvert our people's democratic power.

Rigney also led and expanded the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" in an attempt to subvert our people's democratic power. The "Legion of Mary" in our country is a reactionary secret organization within Catholicism. Its command center, the "Legion of Mary Office," is part of the reactionary "Catholic Central Bureau." Rigney, in his capacity as Secretary-General, led the "Legion of Mary Office" and in January 1950 actively planned to develop this reactionary secret organization throughout the country, enlisting a group of counter-revolutionary special agents as the backbone of the "Legion of Mary" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Shen Duosen, the president of the Shanghai "Legion of Mary" branch, was a special agent of the Chiang bandit gang's "Military Intelligence Bureau Shanghai International Intelligence Station." In July 1951, the Tianjin Military Control Commission, and in October of the same year, the Shanghai Military Control Commission, in order to safeguard the interests of the state and the people, ordered the banning of the local reactionary secret organization "Legion of Mary." In order to continue to undermine our government decrees, Rigney actively colluded with imperialist elements Mocklin, Zhao Yuming, and counter-revolutionaries Shen Shixian, Chen Zhemin, etc., to jointly instigate "Legion of Mary" members to resist registration. Within Shanghai Catholicism, Gong Pinmei, the chief culprit of the counter-revolutionary treasonous group, organized all Shanghai "Legion of Mary" members to resist registration and disrupt the implementation of the Military Control Commission's order, according to Rigney's instructions.

Rigney disseminated the Vatican's reactionary instructions to Gong Pinmei and dioceses across the country, undermining our government decrees.

During his leadership of the "Catholic Central Bureau," Rigney disseminated the Vatican's reactionary instructions to Gong Pinmei and dioceses across the country, coercing Catholics not to support the Communist Party and the People's Government. In February 1952, just as the Chinese people were resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and the broad masses of Catholics were launching an anti-imperialist patriotic movement, Rigney and Liberi conspired to draft and issue the reactionary encyclical "What Should We Do?" and also published the reactionary article "Why Should We Stay?", actively inciting imperialist elements and counter-revolutionaries within Catholicism across the country to attack the People's Government. In April of the same year, he also forwarded Liberi's reactionary instructions to Gong Pinmei and bishops of dioceses across the country through the "Catholic Central Bureau," calling on them to sign "Vows" in an attempt to coordinate with US imperialism's aggression and the Chiang bandit gang's restoration.

After the Shanghai Military Control Commission sealed up the "Catholic Central Bureau" in September 1955, Rigney continued to carry out rumor-mongering and sabotage activities among the clergy and Catholics, saying that "the real place where the communist system should be opposed is not economic, but political," and continued to undermine our government decrees. Within Shanghai Catholicism, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group conducted a series of sabotage activities targeting our country's land reform, resistance against US aggression and aid to Korea, and other political movements, based on the above instructions from Rigney. After the Chinese people achieved victory nationwide, in order to adapt to the development of the situation, US imperialism continued to control Catholicism and engage in activities to subvert the people's democratic power, believing that a Chinese counter-revolutionary cleric must serve as bishop in order to better implement their conspiracy. Therefore, with the support and planning of American spy Rigney and imperialist elements Liberi, Gersping, and Chalmond, and with the approval of the Vatican, Gong Pinmei, who had always resolutely opposed communism and the people, was appointed Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Shanghai in August 1950. At the same time, the Vatican also sent Jin Luxian, who had long received reactionary training, back to Shanghai to assist Gong Pinmei in carrying out treasonous activities. Led by Gong Pinmei, and gathering Jin Luxian, Chen Zhemin, Zhu Xuefan, etc. as the leadership core, a counter-revolutionary treasonous group was organized, swearing allegiance to US imperialism. In January 1951, Gong Pinmei also accepted Rigney's instructions and attended the "Contingency" meeting of the "Catholic Central Bureau" to discuss and decide that if Rigney could not perform his duties, Gong Pinmei would serve as Rigney's agent, take over the leadership of the "Catholic Central Bureau" and dioceses across the country, and continue to command the counter-revolutionaries hiding in Catholicism to carry out conspiracies and sabotage. Under the direct command of Rigney, Liberi, Gersping, and Chalmond, this counter-revolutionary treasonous group, according to the instructions of US imperialism and the Vatican, used the church institutions they controlled to conduct a series of treasonous activities in an organized and planned manner, in order to coordinate with the aggression of US imperialism and the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, cloaked in religion, received firm support from US imperialism.

The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group, cloaked in religion, colluded with imperialism and betrayed the motherland, committing heinous crimes, causing serious harm to the country, the people, and our Catholic friends. The crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group listed in the prosecution are completely based on conclusive evidence and cannot be denied. We clearly remember that the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group, due to the firm support of US imperialism, was extremely rampant in their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. This counter-revolutionary group, cloaked in religion, consistently resisted and undermined the implementation of various national political movements, policies, laws, and decrees. They undermined the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics in Shanghai and even throughout the country, and persecuted patriotic Catholics; created and spread rumors, promoted US imperialist aggressive wars, and undermined the peace movement; colluded with and sheltered imperialist spies, stealing state secrets; harbored special agents and counter-revolutionaries; undermined the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements; established counter-revolutionary secret organizations, conducted espionage training, and lured young Catholics to sneak abroad; privately possessed guns, ammunition, and secret radio stations, plotting to coordinate with the aggression of US imperialism and the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and their crimes were extremely serious. The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group also set up private prisons, and Sister Shu Haiyun was innocently imprisoned in the prison for as long as ten months.

The reason why the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group dared to openly and rampantly carry out a series of criminal activities was that they had the support of US imperialism and were cloaked in religion. They were convinced that as long as all their criminal activities were said to be "for religion," they could cover up their ugly faces, deceive and confuse Catholics, and their conspiracies could be fulfilled as they wished. However, the eyes of the people are discerning. After liberation, due to the general improvement of the political awareness of the broad masses of Catholics, fewer and fewer people believed their nonsense. Therefore, no matter what cloak they wear or how they disguise themselves, they will eventually escape the legal sanctions of the state and the people. We also remember that some Catholics originally saw that the Communist Party was selfless and wholeheartedly serving the people and admired them and were willing to get close to the Party. Some Catholics originally felt that the new China was obviously lovely and began to show patriotic performance, but due to the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group's abuse of "divine power" and the carrying out of strikes and persecution, these Catholics felt depressed, uneasy, and even shrank back. Some were originally active in their work, but because they heard the deception of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, saying that "working for the Communist Party will lose the soul," they became depressed. These facts are too numerous to mention. Now, the Catholics who were once deceived, misled, and used by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group have awakened under the patient education of the Party and have returned to the embrace of the motherland. From the facts of their own suffering, they have exposed the religious mask of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and accused them of a large number of crimes. We no longer allow the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group to use the so-called "for religion" to quibble for their treasonous crimes.

The American spy Rigney and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group were punished by the law, which is another major victory in the anti-imperialist struggle in recent years.

Now the People's Court has conducted a public trial of the American spy Harold Rigney and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group (sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years or life imprisonment respectively). From the interrogation, we further see the seriousness of the crimes committed by this counter-revolutionary treasonous group and its harm, and further see through their so-called "for religion." This is just a most despicable and vicious means of imperialism, and we have completely peeled off their religious cloak. Their use of religion to carry out criminal activities has aroused our unparalleled hatred! We Shanghai Catholics and clergy unanimously expressed our heartfelt support for this solemn measure of the government, and unanimously believe that the American spy Harold Rigney and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group deserve to be punished by the law, which is a gratifying thing and another major victory in the anti-imperialist struggle in recent years. We Shanghai Catholics have long seen clearly the ugly face of US imperialism's use of religion to achieve its aggressive goals. We will never allow Hull to distort the facts and deny and quibble. Facts prove that Harold Rigney is such a heinous spy who engages in subverting our people's democratic power. Does his criminal activity have any religiosity? Directly commanding the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group, betraying the motherland, and selling out the interests of the people, is that his "devotion to the spiritual welfare of his fellow Catholics"? Rigney committed heinous crimes in our country, and Hull's magic claws can never cover the sky. The evidence is like a mountain, the evidence is conclusive, and even Rigney himself cannot deny it. If Hull wants to exonerate him, he will be in vain no matter how hard he tries.

Shanghai Catholics have stood up. The conspiracy of US imperialism and its tool, the Vatican, to use Catholicism to carry out subversive activities has once again suffered a serious blow. We Shanghai Catholics are determined to stand together with the people of the whole country, support the leadership of the Party, take the socialist road, and hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and bravely advance. We must get rid of the control of the Vatican and completely sweep away the remaining influence of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group. In order to realize the independent and self-managed Catholicism of Shanghai, we Shanghai Catholics must, like Catholics across the country, independently elect and consecrate bishops. We must elect patriotic clergymen to be the bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, and forever end the criminal control of the US imperialist tool—the Vatican.

We believe that as long as we are closely united with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party, we can smash all the conspiracies of US imperialism and the Vatican to use religion, and let US imperialism and its tool—the Vatican tremble before the Chinese people! Victory belongs to the Chinese people.

    撕下美国间谍的宗教外衣
    杨士达、张士琅和张家树委员的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告和陈叔通副主席关于全国政协常务委员会工作的报告。从这些报告中，我们看到欣欣向荣的祖国不断继续跃进的面貌。六亿五千万中国人要依靠自己灵敏的双手和无穷的智慧，改造社会，改造世界，迅速地把祖国建成一个现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，使全国人民能过着和平幸福的生活。
    无论赫脱怎样咆哮，也开脱不了老牌间谍华理柱供认的罪行
    但是正如李富春副总理报告中指出的：“……帝国主义分子和敌特分子经常采取阴谋手段，企图破坏我国的社会主义建设事业，……”。最近上海市中级人民法院公开审判的美国间谍华理柱和受他指挥的龚品梅反革命叛国集团就是美帝国主义一贯图谋颠覆中国人民民主政权的一个显明的例子。这个美帝国主义间谍分子华理柱被判处徒刑的当天（本年3月18日），美国国务卿赫脱就发出无耻的“声明”，叫嚣说：“华理柱主教是一个‘无辜的美国公民’，他的唯一的使命是纯宗教性的”，企图掩盖华理柱的罪行。铁的事实证明：华理柱是一个罪大恶极的美国间谍，他的罪恶活动危害了我们国家和人民的利益，（包括天主教友在内）他潜伏在中国没有丝毫宗教性的“使命”而只有颠覆我国政权的政治阴谋，美帝国主义还向我国王炳南大使提出“抗议”，妄图抵赖美国间谍的罪行。王大使严词拒绝了它的“抗议”，并严正指出：它派了间谍到我国来进行颠覆活动，我们才有权利向它提出抗议。让我们揭开这个美国间谍的宗教外衣来看看他有无宗教性？无论赫脱怎样咆哮，也开脱不了这个老牌间谍自己供认不讳的具体罪行。
    当蒋介石反动政权摇摇欲坠时，美帝就派遣华理柱来华策动反共
    当中国人民革命在1948年革命胜利的时候，美帝国主义看到蒋介石反动集团的统治摇摇欲坠，就派遣了美帝国主义分子从事颠覆活动，而臭名远扬的天主教枢机主教史贝尔曼带领老牌间谍华理柱来到我国，同蒋介石反动集团保持着密切联系，利用“演讲”、“祈祷”等活动，策动反共，鼓励蒋介石的“戡乱”战争；同时还以“巡视教务”为名，搜集我解放区的机密情报，积极策划“应变”部署。史贝尔曼去后，华理柱由罗马教廷批准留在中国，同罗马教廷驻蒋介石反动集团“公使”，帝国主义分子黎培里，组织“天主教中央局”，并充任秘书长。这个天主教中央局是美帝国主义假借宗教名义进行颠覆我国人民民主政权的机构。华理柱利用该反动机构，领导和支持下属“华明通讯社”负责人翟光华（美国籍），“劳工法律部”负责人田执中，“文化活动部”助理田望霖，委员侯之正等帝国主义分子和反革命分子，积极进行收集我国军事、政治、经济情报。上海解放后，华理柱为了隐蔽地进行其间谍情报活动，把华明通讯社改为“修会家庭通讯”，通过各教区的通讯员，搜集我国军事、政治、经济情报，送给美国华盛顿，和罗马教廷。
    华理柱组织反动的“圣母军”，图谋颠覆我人民民主政权
    华理柱还领导和扩展反动组织“圣母军”，图谋颠覆我人民民主政权。在我国的“圣母军”是天主教内的反动秘密组织，它的指挥中心“圣母军办公室”是“天主教中央局”反动机构组成部分之一。华理柱以秘书长身份领导“圣母军办公室”，1950年1月，积极策划在全国各地发展这个反动秘密组织，网罗了一批反革命特务分子，作为“圣母军”的骨干，进行反革命活动，如上海“圣母军”分会会长沈多森就是蒋匪帮“军统局上海国际情报站”的特务。1951年7月，天津市军管会，同年10月上海市军管会为了维护国家和人民的利益，下令取缔当地的反动秘密组织“圣母军”时，华理柱为了继续破坏我国政府法令，积极与帝国主义分子莫克勤、赵玉明和反革命分子沈士贤、陈哲敏等共同策动“圣母军”分子抗拒登记。上海天主教内，反革命叛国集团首恶分子龚品梅即根据华理柱意旨组织上海所有“圣母军”分子抗拒登记和破坏军管会命令的实施。
    华理柱向龚品梅和全国各教区传布罗马教廷的反动指令，破坏我国政府法令
    华理柱在领导“天主教中央局”期间，向龚品梅和全国各教区传布罗马教廷的反动指令，胁迫教友不准拥护共产党和人民政府。1952年2月，正当我国人民抗美援朝与广大天主教徒开展反帝爱国运动之际，华理柱与黎培里共谋起草和发布了“我们应该怎样做？”的反动通谕，又发表了“我们为什么应该留下？”的反动文章，积极煽动全国各地天主教内帝国主义分子和反革命分子向人民政府进攻。同年4月，他又将黎培里的反动指示，通过“天主教中央局”转发给龚品梅和全国各教区主教，号召他们订立“誓愿书”，图谋策应美帝国主义的侵略和蒋匪帮复辟。
    1955年9月上海市军管会查封“天主教中央局”后，华理柱仍然在神职人员和教友中进行造谣破坏活动，说什么“共产主义制度真正应该反对之处，不是经济的，而是政治的”等等，继续破坏我国政府法令。上海天主教内，龚品梅反革命叛国集团，针对我国土地改革、抗美援朝等各项政治运动，进行一系列的破坏就是依据华理柱上述指示进行的。中国人民在全国取得胜利后，美帝国主义为了适应形势的发展，继续控制天主教，从事颠覆人民民主政权的活动，认为必须有一个中国籍的反动神职人员担任主教，才能更好地实行他们的阴谋。于是，在美国间谍分子华理柱和帝国主义分子黎培里、格寿平、才尔孟的支持和策划下，经罗马教廷批准，一贯坚决反共反人民的龚品梅，在1950年8月出任天主教上海教区主教。同时罗马教廷将长期受反动训练的金鲁贤也遣返上海，协同龚品梅进行叛国活动。以龚品梅为首，纠集金鲁贤、陈哲敏、朱雪帆等为领导核心，组织反革命叛国集团，宣誓效忠于美帝国主义。1951年1月，龚品梅又接受华理柱的指示，到“天主教中央局”参加“应变”会议，商讨决定：一旦华理柱不能行使职务时，由龚品梅充任华理柱的代理人，接替领导“天主教中央局”和全国各教区，继续指挥隐藏在天主教内的反革命分子进行阴谋破坏。这个反革命叛国集团根据美帝国主义和罗马教廷的指示，在华理柱、黎培里、格寿平、才尔孟的直接指挥下，利用所控制的教会机构，有组织、有计划地进行了一系列的叛国活动，以策应美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石匪帮的复辟。
    披着宗教外衣的龚品梅反革命集团，得到美帝国主义坚决支持
    龚品梅反革命叛国集团，披着宗教外衣，勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，犯下了滔天罪行，给国家，给人民，以及给我们教友造成了严重危害。公诉列举的龚品梅反革命叛国集团的罪行，完全是有确凿根据的，是不容抵赖的。我们清楚地记得，龚品梅反革命叛国集团，由于得到了美帝国主义的坚决支持，他们的反革命破坏活动曾经十分猖狂。这个反革命集团披着宗教外衣，一贯抗拒、破坏国家各项政治运动和政策、法律、法令的实施。破坏上海以至全国各地天主教友的反帝爱国运动，迫害爱国的教友；制造和散布谣言，鼓吹美帝国主义侵略战争，破坏和平运动；勾结、包庇帝国主义间谍，窃取国家机密；窝藏特务、反革命分子；破坏镇压反革命运动；建立反革命秘密组织，进行特务训练，诱骗青年教友潜往海外；私藏枪枝、弹药和秘密电台，图谋策应美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石集团的复辟等等，罪行极为严重。龚品梅反革命集团还私设监牢，修女舒海云竟被无辜囚禁在牢内达十月之久。
    龚品梅反革命叛国集团所以敢于明目张胆，如此猖狂地进行一系列的罪恶活动，是得到了美帝国主义的支持，披上了宗教外衣。他们满以为只要把一切罪恶活动都说成是“为了宗教”，就可以把他们的丑恶面目掩盖起来，就可以欺骗迷惑教友，他们的阴谋诡计就可以如愿得逞。但是，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，解放后的广大天主教友，由于政治觉悟的普遍提高，相信他们鬼话的人也是越来越少了，因此，不管他们披着什么外衣，也不管他们如何伪装，终究是逃不脱国家和人民的法律制裁。我们还记得，有的教友本来看到共产党大公无私，全心全意为人民服务，感到敬佩，愿意靠拢党；也有的教友本来觉得新中国明明可爱，开始有了爱国的表现，但由于龚品梅反革命叛国集团滥施“神权”，进行打击和迫害，致使这些教友内心产生了苦闷和不安以至畏缩不前。有的在工作中本来是积极的，但由于听到龚品梅反革命集团的欺骗，说什么“为共产党工作要失落灵魂”的，于是意志消沉。这些事实举不胜举。现在，曾经被龚品梅反革命集团欺骗蒙蔽和利用的教友，在党的耐心教育下，已经觉醒过来了，回到祖国的怀抱，他们从自己亲身受害的事实中，揭穿了龚品梅反革命叛国集团的宗教假面具，控诉了他们的大量罪行。我们再不容许龚品梅反革命叛国集团用所谓“为了宗教”，来为他们的叛国罪行作狡辩。
    美国间谍华理柱和龚品梅反革命集团受到国法惩办，是几年来反帝斗争又一重大胜利
    现在人民法院已经对美国间谍华理柱和龚品梅反革命叛国集团进行了公开审判。（分别处以五年以上有期徒刑或无期徒刑）从审讯中，我们进一步看清了这个反革命叛国集团所犯罪行的严重性和它的危害性，进一步识破了他们口口声声所谓“为了宗教”。这不过是帝国主义一种最卑鄙毒辣的手段，我们已经完全剥开了他们的宗教外衣，他们利用宗教进行罪恶活动，更加激起了我们无比愤恨！我们上海天主教友和神职人员都一致表示衷心拥护政府这一严正的措施，一致认为美国间谍华理柱和龚品梅反革命叛国集团受到国法惩办，是罪有应得，大快人心的事，是几年来反帝斗争的又一重大胜利。对美帝国主义利用宗教达到其侵略目的的丑恶面目，我们上海天主教友早已看得很清楚了。我们决不许赫脱颠倒黑白抵赖狡辩。事实证明华理柱是这样一个从事颠覆我国人民民主政权的罪大恶极的间谍分子，他的罪恶活动有丝毫宗教性吗？直接指挥龚品梅反革命叛国集团，背叛祖国，出卖人民利益，难道就是他“对他的天主教友精神福利的献身精神”吗？华理柱在我国犯下了滔天大罪，决不是赫脱的魔掌掩得住天下的。罪证如山，证据确凿，连华理柱自己也无法抵赖，赫脱要想为他开脱，想尽办法也将是徒然的。
    上海天主教友已经站起来了，美帝国主义和它的工具，罗马教廷利用天主教进行颠覆活动的阴谋，再次遭到严重的打击，我们上海天主教友坚决和全国人民站在一起，拥护党的领导，走社会主义道路，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，奋勇前进。我们要摆脱罗马教廷的控制，彻底清扫龚品梅反革命叛国集团的残余影响，为了实现上海天主教独立自主自办，我们上海教友一定要和全国教友一样，自选自圣主教，我们要选出爱国的神长来，当上海教区的主教，永远结束美帝国主义的工具——罗马教廷的罪恶控制。
    我们相信，只要我们在党的领导下和全国人民紧密的团结在一起，我们就能粉碎美帝国主义和罗马教廷利用宗教的一切阴谋，让美帝国主义和它的工具——罗马教廷在中国人民面前发抖吧！胜利是属于中国人民的。
