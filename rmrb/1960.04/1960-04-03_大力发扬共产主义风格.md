    Vigorously Promote the Communist Style
    By a staff commentator
    The Party Central Committee said in its congratulatory message to the National Conference of Heroes: "The great historical role of advanced units and advanced producers lies not only in their outstanding achievements in promoting China's socialist construction, but also in their ability to help others and other units quickly reach advanced levels." Li Nongqin, a female worker from the fine spinning workshop of the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory in Urumqi, Xinjiang, who attended the National Conference of Heroes, faithfully implemented the Party's call and tried every possible means to help many backward comrades catch up with or surpass her technical level, thereby rapidly and universally improving the production level of the entire workshop. Her collectivist thinking and communist style have been more widely spread throughout the factory, the city, and even the entire region. In the "Learn from Li Nongqin" movement in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, thousands upon thousands of "Li Nongqin-style" pacesetters have emerged. Many factory and mining enterprises have put forward with unparalleled heroism: "No backwardness is allowed around the advanced," and "No brother should be left behind in the cause of socialist construction." This has given the mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution in the Xinjiang region a distinct communist style.
    In the great cause of socialist construction, the advanced producer Li Nongqin not only labors actively, overfulfilling production plans month after month, and diligently studies and constantly improves her technical level for years; but what is even more valuable is her help to comrades, which has a high degree of communist style. She helps backward comrades improve their thinking and skills, always trying every possible means, working hard and tirelessly, and patiently. She regards helping others catch up with her as her own responsibility. This consciousness and initiative in helping others is a concentrated reflection of the Chinese working class's high sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction.
    In any production and construction undertaking, there are always differences between the advanced, the intermediate, and the backward. This is true in terms of technology, and it is also true in terms of ideology. From the perspective of the backward, they should go all out, strive for progress, and humbly learn from the advanced. However, from the perspective of the people of all ethnic groups in our country building the socialist cause with full confidence, the vast majority of those who are backward in technology and ideology are only temporarily so. Advanced producers should treat comrades who are not skilled in technology or who are temporarily backward with the desire for unity and common progress, and show concern for these comrades enthusiastically, patiently, and in many ways. Helping them improve rapidly is not only the common aspiration of the broad masses, but also the responsibility of advanced producers. At the same time, in the rapid development of China's socialist construction, new things are constantly developing and growing. Today's backward may catch up with the advanced tomorrow. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers and staff are conducting comrade-style mutual learning and mutual assistance in order to achieve common improvement, just like the Yangtze River pushing forward wave after wave, forming a magnificent socialist labor competition. This is essentially different from the "competition" of rivalry in capitalist society. Li Nongqin fully demonstrated the comrade-style competition principle and the lofty communist style in the socialist competition. She is not conservative, nor is she complacent; she tries every possible means to help others, and also actively strives to be advanced; she helps her competitors surpass her, and then immediately turns around to learn technology from more advanced people; she teaches her own advanced technology to others, and also teaches the advanced technology she has just learned from others to comrades who do not know it; when other comrades cannot accept it for a while, she can find the reasons from the ideological and technical aspects and overcome the difficulties; she believes that advanced technology cannot be privately owned, and advanced thinking cannot be privately owned either. Such assistance can turn the technical level of advanced producers into the general production level of society more quickly.
    Political thought is the soul and commander of all work. A person who is technically advanced, if he does not have advanced thinking, even if he has great talents, is insignificant compared with the collective strength of the broad masses and the great socialist collective cause. Only when this advanced technology is under the guidance of advanced thinking can it fully play its role. Li Nongqin's advanced actions in helping comrades precisely show that under the cultivation of the Party and the help of comrades, she has clearly established the idea that "it is not good for one person to be good, it is good for everyone to be good." Her help to others is not temporary, accidental, or limited to a few people, but is persistent and selfless help that includes all those who need help. She is not afraid of others surpassing herself, but rejoices in the fact that more comrades have reached advanced levels. When she leaves the advanced collective group, she is not concerned with maintaining personal honor and material treatment, but with the common leap forward of the collective. This high degree of collectivist spirit reflects the working class's communist world outlook. It is under the guidance of this world outlook that advanced producers can play a greater role and accomplish the historical tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people. When the Urumqi July 1st Cotton Textile Factory promotes the technical experience of advanced producers, it also seizes the opportunity to summarize and promote the advanced thinking of advanced producers. Therefore, it has made the communist style flourish in the factory and production has developed rapidly, which is the result of "putting politics in command and letting ideology go first."
    Advanced producers are not extraordinary heroes, and they all have had or still have various shortcomings. But they listen to the Party, can humbly learn from the masses, dare to face their own shortcomings or mistakes, and overcome them without hesitation. In this way, they will become advanced producers and can keep the red flag flying. In the past, Li Nongqin's operating skills were not as good as others, and she was not patient enough in helping comrades, and she also had some shortcomings in her thinking. But she resolutely listened to the Party, accepted the supervision and help of the masses, was not complacent, was not conservative, humbly learned from the advanced, and made considerable progress in her thinking and technology, becoming more and more advanced. Therefore, she has become a red flag for the broad masses of workers and staff in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to learn from. We believe that the more "Li Nongqin-style" pacesetters appear, the faster the advanced technology of advanced producers will be mastered by the broad masses of workers and staff, and the more rapidly the advanced technical level will become the production level of the whole society.

    大力发扬共产主义风格
    本报评论员
    党中央在全国群英会上的祝词中说：“先进单位和先进生产者的伟大历史作用，不仅在于他们以自己的卓越成就促进了我国的社会主义建设事业，而且在于他们能够帮助别人和别的单位迅速提高到先进的水平上来”。出席了全国群英会的新疆乌鲁木齐七一棉纺织厂精纺车间女工李弄琴，忠实地执行了党的号召，千方百计帮助许许多多的后进同志，赶上或超过了自己的技术水平，从而使全车间的生产水平得到了迅速的普遍的提高。而她的这种集体主义思想和共产主义风格，更广泛地传播到全厂、全市以至全区。新疆维吾尔自治区各地广大职工在“学习李弄琴”运动中，出现了成千上万的“李弄琴式”标兵。许多厂、矿企业的职工，以无比的英雄气概提出：“先进周围不允许有落后”，“不让一个兄弟在建设社会主义事业中掉队”，这就使新疆地区以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动具有鲜明的共产主义风格。
    在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，先进生产者李弄琴不仅仅积极劳动，月月超额完成生产计划，数年如一日地刻苦钻研，不断提高自己的技术水平；而更可贵的是她对同志的帮助，具有高度的共产主义风格。她帮助后进同志提高思想、提高技术，总是千方百计、任劳任怨、不厌其烦。她把帮助别人赶上自己，看成是自己的责任。帮助别人的这种自觉性和主动性，集中反映了我国工人阶级对社会主义建设事业高度的责任心。
    在任何一项生产建设事业中，总是有先进、中间和落后的差别的。技术上是这样，思想上也是这样。从后进者来说，应该鼓足干劲，力争上游，虚心向先进学习。但是，从我国各族人民满怀信心地建设社会主义事业来看，绝大多数技术上思想上的后进者只是暂时的。先进生产者对待技术不熟练或者暂时还是后进的同志，应该从团结和共同进步的愿望出发，热情、耐心地多方面地关心这些同志。帮助他们迅速提高，这不但是广大群众的共同意愿，也是先进生产者的责任。同时，在我国社会主义建设事业一日千里飞跃发展中，新生事物总是不断发展、成长，今天的后进，明天就可能赶上了先进。广大职工群众在党的领导下为实现共同的理想目标，为建设共同的幸福生活，进行同志式的互相学习，互相帮助，以达到共同提高，正如长江后浪推前浪，形成为波澜壮阔的社会主义劳动竞赛。这和资本主义社会中的你争我夺的“竞争”，有本质的不同。李弄琴在社会主义竞赛中，充分地表现了同志式的竞赛原则和崇高的共产主义风格。她不保守，同时也不自满；她千方百计地帮助别人，也积极努力争先进；她帮助自己的竞赛对手超过自己，又马上反过来向更先进的人学习技术；她把自己的先进技术传授给别人，又把刚刚向别人学来的先进技术传授给不会的同志；当别的同志一时还接受不了时，她能从思想上、技术上找寻原因，克服困难；她认为先进的技术不能私有，先进的思想也不能私有。这样的帮助，就能够把先进生产者的技术水平，更快地变为社会普遍的生产水平。
    政治思想是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。一个技术先进的人，如果他没有先进的思想，纵使有再大的才能，但和广大群众的集体力量比较起来，和伟大的社会主义集体事业比较起来，就显得微不足道了。只有当这种先进技术处于先进思想的指导下，才能充分发挥出作用。李弄琴帮助同志的先进行动，正是说明她在党的培养和同志们的帮助下，明确地树立了“一个人好不算好，大家好才是好”的思想。她对别人的帮助，不是一时的、偶然的或者局限于部分人的，而是坚持不懈的和包括所有需要帮助的同志的无私帮助。不是怕别人超过了自己，而是为更多的同志达到了先进水平而欢欣鼓舞。她离开先进集体小组时，考虑的不是维护个人的荣誉和物质待遇，而是关心集体的共同跃进。这种高度的集体主义精神，反映了工人阶级的共产主义世界观。正是在这种世界观的指导下，先进生产者才能发挥更大的作用，完成党和人民交给他的历史任务。乌鲁木齐七一棉纺织厂，在推广先进生产者的技术经验时，更抓紧总结和推广先进生产者的先进思想，因此，使厂内大兴共产主义风格，生产飞跃发展，这正是“政治挂帅，思想先行”的结果。
    先进生产者也并不是异乎寻常的英雄，也都会有过或者还有着各种各样的缺点。但是他们听党的话，能虚心向群众学习，敢于面对自己的缺点或错误，毫不犹豫地加以克服。这样，他们就会成为先进生产者，并能保持红旗不倒。过去，李弄琴有些操作技术还不如别人，帮助同志也还不够耐心，思想上也还有些缺点。但她坚决听党的话，接受群众的监督和帮助，不自满，不保守，虚心向先进学习，在思想上和技术上得到不少的提高，先进再先进，因而成为新疆维吾尔自治区广大职工学习的一面红旗。我们相信，“李弄琴式”标兵出现的愈多，先进生产者的技术也就愈快地为广大职工群众所掌握，先进的技术水平就更日益迅速地成为全社会的生产水平。
