Xinhua News Agency, April 19th—The China Peace Committee today sent a telegram to the Japan Peace Committee, forwarded to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," resolutely supporting the Japanese people's 15th nationwide unified action against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The telegram reads as follows:
    To the Japan Peace Committee, forwarded to
    the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty":
    Based on the significant achievements continually made by the Japanese people in their powerful struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," they are now launching the 15th nationwide unified action on an even larger scale and with greater momentum, resolutely opposing the Kishi Nobusuke clique's attempt to forcibly ratify the so-called U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" in the Japanese Diet. The 15th unified action once again demonstrates the Japanese people's firm will and strength in opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance, opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and demanding a path of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. It is becoming increasingly clear that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to conclude a military alliance and collude in planning new wars threatens peace in Asia and the world, seriously endangering the vital interests and security of the Japanese nation, thereby arousing increasingly broad and strong opposition from the Japanese people, the people of Asia, and the people of the world. The Chinese people express their heartfelt respect to the heroic and persistent Japanese people in their struggle.
    The Chinese people have consistently supported the just struggle of the people of Japan and will continue to provide resolute support in the future. The Chinese people are willing to work closely with the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to jointly strive to smash the war and aggression conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and defend peace in Asia and the world. We are pleased to see the Japanese people continuously strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle, and we firmly believe that any conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries will be met with shameful failure, that U.S. imperialism will eventually be driven out of Japan, and that the Japanese people's desire for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality will certainly be realized.
    We wish the Japanese people new and greater achievements in the 15th unified action.
    China Peace Committee

    Xinhua News Agency, April 19th—The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), forwarded to the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," extending the highest respect to the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the people who have been persistently and bravely struggling against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and the revival of militarism, and warmly supporting their holding of the 15th nationwide unified action.
    The telegram stated, "The Kishi Nobusuke government, in collusion with the United States, signed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, revived Japanese militarism, and clamored to include our territories of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan within the scope of the military treaty, threatening peace in Asia and the world and seriously endangering the vital interests and security of the Japanese nation. Recently, it has even openly colluded with Adenauer, and with the support of the United States, has rampantly engaged in activities to restore the old German-Japanese axis of aggression. U.S. imperialism has become the target of universal condemnation by the people of the world, and supporting the revival of West German and Japanese militarism will inevitably backfire. The lessons of history and the changing times mean that Kishi Nobusuke and Adenauer will only meet a more tragic fate than Hitler and Tojo."
    The telegram stated, "The Chinese workers are full of confidence in the just struggle of the Japanese workers and the broad masses of the people. No matter what difficulties and setbacks are encountered in the long struggle, as long as they stand firm, have clear goals, unite widely, and persevere unremittingly, an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan will certainly emerge."

    Xinhua News Agency, April 19th—The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Japan Democratic Youth League, forwarded to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," representing 130 million Chinese youth and students in fully supporting the Japanese people and youth in launching the 15th nationwide unified action against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram stated, "The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government's conclusion of a U.S.-Japan military alliance not only thoroughly exposed the reactionary face of the Japanese militarist forces intensifying their enslavement of the Japanese people and attempting to invade Asia once again, but also once again exposed the U.S. imperialist aggressive conspiracy to turn Japan into a source of war under the guise of false peace. Recently, Japanese and West German militarist forces have openly colluded with the support of the United States, intensifying the creation of international tensions. However, the current international situation is completely different compared to twenty years ago. Today, the East wind has prevailed and continues to prevail over the West wind. The strength of the socialist camp, the strength of the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the strength of the world peace movement have greatly exceeded the war and aggression forces of imperialism. This excellent situation powerfully supports and encourages the Japanese people's struggle against the war and aggression conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. The heroic struggles against the revision of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' continuously launched by the Japanese people and youth in the past year have become increasingly impassioned and the momentum has grown increasingly strong. We firmly believe that no force can stop the advance of the Japanese people and youth, and that your struggle for national independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality will certainly overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory."

    任何力量挡不住日本人民前进步伐
    我和大、全总、青联和学联致电支持日本人民斗争
    新华社19日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电日本和平委员会并转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对新日美“安全条约”展开第十五次全国统一行动。电文如下：
    日本和平委员会并转
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议：
    日本人民在反对新日美“安全条约”的强大斗争不断取得重要成就的基础上，又在以更大的规模和声势展开第十五次全国统一行动，坚决反对岸信介集团企图在日本国会强行批准所谓日美“共同合作和安全条约”。第十五次统一行动再一次显示出日本人民反对日美军事同盟、反对日本军国主义复活和要求走独立、和平、民主、中立道路的坚强意志和力量。越来越明显，美日反动派缔结军事同盟相互勾结策划新战争的阴谋，威胁亚洲和世界的和平，严重危害日本民族的切身利益和安全，从而激起日本人民、亚洲和世界人民愈来愈广泛和强烈的反对。中国人民对英勇地坚持斗争的日本人民表示衷心的敬意。
    中国人民一贯支持日本人民的正义斗争，今后仍将继续予以坚决支持。中国人民愿同日本人民和亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，紧密携手，为粉碎美日反动派的战争侵略阴谋，保卫亚洲和世界和平而共同奋斗。我们高兴地看到日本人民不断地加强团结，坚持斗争，并深信美日反动派的任何阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败，美帝国主义终将从日本赶出去，日本人民要求独立、和平、民主、中立的愿望一定能够实现。
    敬祝日本人民在第十五次统一行动中取得新的更大的成就。

    新华社19日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本总评议会并转阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，向坚持不懈地为反对日美军事同盟条约、反对军国主义复活而进行英勇斗争的日本工人和广大人民致以崇高的敬意，并热烈支持他们举行第十五次全国统一行动。
    电报说，“岸信介政府勾结美国签订日美军事同盟条约，复活了日本军国主义，叫嚣着把我们领土金门、马祖、台湾列入军事条约的范围，威胁亚洲和世界的和平，严重危害日本民族的切身利益和安全。最近更公然和阿登纳勾结，在美国的支持下猖狂地进行恢复往日的德日侵略轴心的活动。美帝国主义已成为全世界人民的众矢之的，扶持西德、日本军国主义的复活也必然自食其果。历史的教训和时代的不同，使岸信介和阿登纳只会遭到比希特勒和东条更悲惨的命运。”
    电报说，“中国工人对于日本工人和广大人民的正义斗争充满着信心，不论在长期的斗争中遇到什么困难和曲折，只要立场坚定、目标明确、团结广泛、不屈不挠地坚持下去，独立、民主、和平、中立的日本是一定会出现的。”
    新华社19日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会，今天致电日本民主青年同盟并转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，代表一亿三千万中国青年和学生全力支持日本人民和青年为反对日美“安全条约”展开第十五次全国统一行动。
    电报说，“日本岸信介政府同美国缔结日美军事同盟，不仅彻底暴露了日本军国主义势力加紧奴役日本人民，妄图再次侵略亚洲的反动面目，而且也再一次暴露了美帝国主义在假和平的伪装下把日本变成战争策源地的侵略阴谋。最近日本和西德军国主义势力在美国的支持下又公开勾结，加紧制造国际紧张局势。但是今天的国际形势同二十年前相比较，已完全不同了。今天东风已经并继续压倒西风。社会主义阵营的力量，亚、非、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的力量和世界和平运动的力量，已经大大超过帝国主义的战争侵略势力。这样的大好形势有力地支持和鼓舞着日本人民反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的战争和侵略阴谋的斗争。日本人民和青年在过去一年中所连续掀起的反对修改日美‘安全条约’的英勇斗争，群情日益激昂，声势愈益浩大。我们深信，任何力量都阻挡不了日本人民和青年的前进步伐，你们争取民族独立、和平、民主和中立的斗争一定会冲破各种困难而取得最后的胜利。”
