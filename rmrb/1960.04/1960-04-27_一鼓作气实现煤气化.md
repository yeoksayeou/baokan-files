Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi Province's light industry front has adopted a method of multi-pronged pilot projects and rapid promotion to vigorously develop the coal gasification movement. In just over half a month, more than 100 coal gasifiers have been built and put into production.

Currently, the coal gasification movement in the province's light industry system has expanded from ceramics to various industries such as textiles, enamel, rubber, oils and fats, and food. It has also evolved from production kilns to household stoves.

Currently, the province's light industry workers are continuing to vigorously develop the coal gasification movement, determined to achieve coal gasification ahead of schedule.

This newspaper reports: A mass movement of thousands of troops vigorously developing coal gasification is sweeping across Shenyang City. As of April 20th, according to statistics from 105 units, 251 various types of simple coal gas generators have been built, more than half of which have been put into production. They are using the spirit of revolutionary action in three to five days to quickly realize coal gasification.

In the process of vigorously developing coal gasification, all units have implemented the policy of combining indigenous methods with foreign methods. The furnaces built are characterized by simple structure, low cost, and high efficiency. For example, the glass factory's air gasifier does not require a blower or power equipment. It can be ignited in three to five days and can be used for production, cooking, heating, firing kilns, and firing small boilers. The water pump factory worked hard for three days and built eight furnaces, including a small furnace for boiling large kettles, which has sufficient gas volume, can be used and stopped at will, and has advantages that ordinary foreign gas furnaces do not have, making it very suitable for use in government agencies, shops, and cafeterias.

This newspaper reports: Light industrial factories in the Xining area have started with indigenous methods to promote coal gas utilization. In a short half-month, the number of units using coal gas has reached more than 75% of the entire industry. The use of coal gas has spread to production and daily life, such as firing ceramics, bricks and tiles, melting glass, baking furnaces, boilers, cooking, and boiling water.

Using indigenous methods to build coal gas generators and using coal gas instead of burning coal has achieved huge economic benefits. According to statistics, coal consumption in light industrial factories in the Xining area has generally decreased by about 40%.

Vigorously utilizing coal gas has also brought benefits to the transportation and raw material departments. According to preliminary statistics, due to the 40% reduction in coal consumption, the light industrial factories in the Xining area alone can save 280,000 tons of coal for production annually, reducing the number of coal transportation trucks by 100 per day.

This newspaper reports: The Lüda City launched a nationwide mass movement to vigorously promote indigenous coal gasification, and quickly achieved great success. As of April 20, a total of 190 indigenous coal gasifiers had been built.

The rapid promotion of indigenous coal gasifiers is inseparable from the strengthened leadership of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee and the party committees at all levels. At the end of March, the Municipal Party Committee discovered that workers at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory had built an indigenous coal gasifier with a simple structure, few materials, and easy to promote in just four days. It immediately held an on-site meeting, calling on all units to quickly promote it. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, all units immediately mobilized the masses to learn and promote it, and quickly achieved good results. The Party Branch of the Mechanical Branch of the Dalian Chemical Plant led the workers and, after full preparation, built four indigenous coal gasifiers in just one night, which not only basically realized coal gasification in the high-pressure, mechanical, and casting workshops, but also realized coal gasification in the cafeteria.

    一鼓作气实现煤气化
    江西  轻工业系统多头试点快速推广  西宁  利用煤气煤耗下降百分之四十
    沈阳  土洋并举简易煤气炉百花齐放  旅大  加强领导迅速建炉一百九十座
    据新华社南昌电　江西省轻工业战线采取多头试点快速推广的办法，大搞煤气化运动，半个多月来已经建成和投入生产的煤气炉达一百多座。
    目前，全省轻工业系统的煤气化运动，已从陶瓷发展到纺织、搪瓷、橡胶、油脂、食品等各行各业，并且已从生产窑炉发展到生活炉灶。
    目前，全省轻工业职工正在继续大搞煤气化运动，决心提前实现煤气化。
    本报讯　沈阳市正在掀起一个千军万马大搞煤气化的群众运动。到4月20日止，据一百零五个单位统计，已建成各式简易煤气发生炉二百五十一个，其中有半数以上已投入生产。他们正在用三、五天革个命的精神，迅速实现煤气化。
    各单位在大搞煤气化过程中，贯彻了土法和洋法并举的方针。所建的炉子，都具有构造简单、成本低、效益大的特点。如玻璃厂的空气煤气炉，不用鼓风机和动力设备，三、五天就可以点火，生产、烧饭、取暖、烧窑、烧小锅炉都可以使用。水泵厂大干三天，建成了八个炉子，其中有个烧大水壶的小炉子，气量充足，可用可停，具有一般洋煤气炉所不及的优点，很适合机关、商店、食堂采用。
    本报讯　西宁地区轻工业各厂土法上马，推广煤气利用，短短半个月时间，利用煤气单位达到全行业的75％以上，煤气使用范围遍及生产、生活领域，如烧陶瓷、砖瓦、熔化玻璃、烘炉、锅炉、煮饭烧水等方面。
    用土法建立煤气发生炉，使用煤气代替煤炭燃烧，收到了巨大的经济效果。据统计：西宁地区各轻工工厂，煤耗已经普遍下降了40％左右。
    大力利用煤气，还给运输部门与原料材料部门带来了好处，仅据初步统计，由于煤耗降低40％，全年仅西宁地区轻工工厂的生产用煤，即可节约二十八万吨，每天能减少运煤汽车一百辆。
    本报讯　旅大市开展全民性大闹土煤气化运动，迅速取得了巨大的成就，到4月20日，共建成土煤气炉一百九十座。
    土煤气炉所以能够迅速推广，是同中共旅大市委和各级党委的加强领导分不开的。市委在3月末发现大连机车车辆厂职工只用四天时间就建成一座结构简单、用料很少、便于推广的土煤气炉，立即召开现场会议，号召各个单位迅速推广。各单位根据市委的指示，立即发动群众进行学习和推广，迅速获得良好效果。大连化工厂机械分厂党总支领导职工，经过充分准备，只突击一夜，就建成了四座土煤气炉，不但使高压、机械、铸造等三个车间基本上实现了煤气化，而且食堂也实现了煤气化。（附图片）
