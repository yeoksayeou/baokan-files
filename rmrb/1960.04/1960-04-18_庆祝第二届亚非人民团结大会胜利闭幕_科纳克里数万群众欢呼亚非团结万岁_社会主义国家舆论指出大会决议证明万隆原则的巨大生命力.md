Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 16th—Tens of thousands of people attended a mass rally in Conakry on the afternoon of April 15th, celebrating the successful conclusion of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

    The mass rally was held in front of the conference hall of the current Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. National flags and colored flags of Asian and African countries attending the conference fluttered in the wind. Huge banners were hung on the streets, with slogans such as "Long Live Asian-African Solidarity!" and "Down with Imperialism and Colonialism!"

    Hours before the start of the rally, crowds had already gathered on the sidewalks and streets. They sang, danced, and cheered. Representatives and observers from various Asian and African countries also participated in the celebration rally.

    Guinean President Sékou Touré congratulated the delegates on the success of the conference. He said he believed that the resolutions unanimously adopted at the conference were in line with the interests of the Asian and African people. The implementation of these resolutions will bring about fundamental changes to the reality of Asia and Africa.

    He also said that the resolutions have been passed, and from now on, action is even more important. He emphasized that the problems of Asia and Africa cannot be separated. Their common goals are: independence, freedom, and unity. He said that relying on the strength and unity of the people will certainly eliminate imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 17th—TASS and Bulgarian and Mongolian newspapers have published commentaries commenting on the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which closed on the 15th, and warmly supporting "Africa Day."

    A TASS commentator wrote on the 16th that the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference reflected the unity of the envoys of the people of Asian and African countries. From Conakry, a call was sent to the world, calling on all people to unite and launch a final offensive against colonialism.

    The commentary said that the torch lit in Bandung is also shining brightly in Conakry, because it illuminates the road for the people of Asian and African countries. It is no coincidence that the participants of the conference made a solemn oath on the conference forum: to spare no effort to implement the historically significant Bandung Principles.

    The commentary said that the Conakry conference once again powerfully emphasized that the rights of the people of Asian and African countries to establish and develop their national organizations, economies, and cultures are sacred and inviolable. The commentary said that this conference once again shows that it is impossible to solve international problems without the Asian and African people, and that the people of these countries are active factors in world political life. The resolutions of the conference once again proved that the Bandung Principles, as the principle of peaceful coexistence, which is an objective need of our time, have great vitality.

    The Bulgarian "Otechestven Front" commentary on the 16th pointed out that the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference shows that the awakened people of Asian and African countries are more aware of the need to strengthen unity in the struggle against old and new colonialists.

    The Mongolian "Unen" published a commentary on the 16th, warmly supporting "Africa Day." The commentary said that at present, the bellicose elements of imperialist countries are carrying out anti-peace preparatory activities. Under such circumstances, the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism is of great significance to the struggle for world peace.

    The commentary said that the Mongolian people fully believe that the unity of the African people will surely achieve new victories in the struggle against imperialist wars, and the sunshine of freedom and liberation will shine all over Africa.
