Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: A reporter from this news agency reports: The United States is continuing to support the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique with bayonets, while at the same time employing deceptive tactics in an attempt to alleviate the people's struggle.

    After a large demonstration broke out in Seoul, the center of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, on the 19th, the US military command in Korea "abandoned" its "control" over the Syngman Rhee puppet army's 15th Division that same day, rushing this division from the ceasefire line to Seoul to participate in the bloody suppression. Subsequently, US Secretary of Defense Gates announced on the 21st that the US Army was studying the possibility of increasing the strength of the two US divisions stationed in South Korea.

    The United States also threatened viciously to further carry out bloody suppression. The "Washington Star" said on the 20th, "We believe that force must be used (against the South Korean people), and it must continue to be used until order is restored." United Press International said that the United States "cannot tolerate" the South Korean people's uprising struggle. Agence France-Presse quoted threats from Washington as saying, "If the freedom of the Seoul government is threatened again, it can count on the support of some countries that have fought alongside South Korean troops against communism."

    United Press International admitted that the current US situation on the South Korean issue is "indeed very difficult," like "walking on eggs." A Kyodo News dispatch from Washington said that the US government is concerned that the development of the situation in South Korea "will significantly damage the international standing of the United States." Therefore, for several days, while supporting Syngman Rhee's bloody suppression, the United States has been intensifying its deceptive tactics in an attempt to conceal its guilt and continue to maintain its rule.

    One of the US tactics is to feign concern for the South Korean people's demands for democratic and free rights, "sympathize" with the "legitimate grievances" of South Korean demonstrators, and vigorously publicize the US demand that Syngman Rhee "guarantee democratic rights." To this end, the US Secretary of State issued a statement, and the US "Embassy" in South Korea issued a statement. US newspapers and news agencies also publicized that the United States is "exerting pressure" on Syngman Rhee.

    Another US tactic is to collude with Syngman Rhee and find scapegoats to alleviate the people's resentment. The US "Ambassador" to South Korea, McConaughy, had a secret talk with Syngman Rhee for more than an hour on the morning of the 21st. Soon after, Syngman Rhee's "cabinet ministers" submitted their resignations. These "ministers" said that they resigned because they were "responsible" for the recent outbreak of demonstrations.

    According to US news agencies, the United States also intends to have Syngman Rhee's crony Lee Ki-poong, who was elected "Vice President" in the fake election, resign and hold a new "Vice Presidential" election. The Associated Press said on the 23rd, "All indications are that Syngman Rhee hopes to quell the angry public opinion caused by the election by letting Lee Ki-poong step down (which means only re-electing the Vice President)." United Press International also publicized: "Political pressure" demanding Lee Ki-poong's resignation "is growing." Lee Ki-poong issued a statement on the 23rd, saying that he is "considering" resigning.

    In addition, according to US news agencies, the United States also intends to implement "liberalization" in the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, pulling some opposition parties and non-partisan politicians into the cabinet to decorate the "democratic" facade and deceive the South Korean people. At the same time, it is also planning to change the current puppet regime's "presidential system" to a "cabinet responsibility system," setting up a "prime minister" under the "president" Syngman Rhee to alleviate the South Korean people's opposition to Syngman Rhee.

    美国极力支撑南朝鲜傀儡政权
    一面支持李承晚血腥镇压　一面欺骗笼络以息众怒
    据新华社23日讯　本社记者报道：美国正在一方面继续用刺刀支持李承晚集团的法西斯统治，同时又耍弄一些欺骗手法以图缓和人民的斗争。
    在李承晚傀儡政权的统治中心汉城19日爆发了大示威之后，侵朝美军司令部当天就“放弃”了对李承晚伪军第十五师团的“控制”，把这个师团从停战线赶调到汉城去参加血腥镇压。接着，美国国防部长盖茨又在21日宣布，美国陆军正在研究增加美国驻南朝鲜两师军队的兵力的可能性。
    美国还穷凶极恶地威胁要进一步进行血腥镇压。“华盛顿明星晚报”20日说，“我们认为必须（对南朝鲜人民）使用武力，而且必须继续使用武力直到秩序恢复为止”。合众国际社说，美国“不能容忍”南朝鲜人民的起义斗争。法新社援引华盛顿方面的威胁说，“如果汉城政府的自由再度受到威胁，它可以指望曾同南朝鲜军队并肩对共产主义作战的一些国家的支持”。
    合众国际社承认，美国目前在南朝鲜问题上的处境“确实非常困难”，像“在鸡蛋上走路”。共同社发自华盛顿的一条消息说，美国政府担心南朝鲜局势的发展“将会显著地损害美国的国际地位”。因此，几天来，美国在支持李承晚血腥镇压的同时，一直在加紧耍弄各种欺骗手法，以图掩饰自己的罪责，继续维持它的统治。
    美国的一个手法是假惺惺地表示关心南朝鲜人民对民主自由权利的要求，“同情”南朝鲜示威者的“正当的不满”，并大肆宣传美国要求李承晚“保障民主权利”。为此，美国国务卿发表了谈话，美国驻南朝鲜“大使馆”发表了声明。美国报纸和通讯社还宣传美国正在对李承晚“施加压力”。
    美国的另一个手法是与李承晚勾结，找替罪羊来缓和人民的愤恨情绪。美国驻南朝鲜“大使”麦康瑙吉在21日上午找李承晚密谈了一个多小时，不久以后，李承晚的“内阁部长”就提出了总辞职。这些“部长”说他们辞职的原因是对最近爆发的示威“负有责任”。
    据美国通讯社透露，美国还打算使在伪选中当选为“副总统”的李承晚的亲信李起鹏辞职，重新举行“副总统”选举。美联社23日说，“一切迹象表明，李承晚希望用光让李起鹏下台（这就意味着只重新选举副总统）的办法，来平息选举所引起的愤怒的舆论”。合众国际社也宣传：要求李起鹏让位的“政治压力愈来愈大了”。李起鹏已在23日发表声明，正在“考虑”辞职。
    另外，据美国通讯社透露，美国也打算使李承晚傀儡政权实行“自由化”，拉一些反对党小党派和无党派政客参加内阁，以装饰“民主”门面，欺骗南朝鲜人民。同时也在策划把目前傀儡政权的“总统制”改为“内阁负责制”，在李承晚担任的“总统”之下再设一“总理”，以缓和南朝鲜人民反对李承晚的情绪。
