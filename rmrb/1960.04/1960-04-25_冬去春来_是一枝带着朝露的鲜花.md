“Winter Goes, Spring Comes” is a Fresh Flower with Morning Dew
Sun Wei Shi

During this modern theme opera observation performance, a large number of new talents have emerged on the opera stage. They inherit tradition, maintain the characteristics of each opera genre, yet are not bound by tradition, boldly creating and presenting the rich and colorful reality of life, creating vivid images of heroic figures in socialist construction, and painting a brilliant future for the development of opera! Seeing the colorful flowers, sparkling with morning dew, blooming in the opera garden, how can one not be excited, how can one not cheer for the leaping flower of opera!

In this beautiful modern theme opera performance, I would like to introduce “Winter Goes, Spring Comes” performed by the Henan Yu Opera Troupe No. 3. It is a good play. The content is: The Jiulong Mountain area suffers from severe drought in normal times, but when it rains, flash floods erupt, rushing through houses and submerging land like fierce tigers, causing great suffering to the people. Although the situation has improved since liberation, natural disasters still threaten the people. In 1957, under the call of the Party, the people of the mountainous area set high aspirations to fundamentally change the poor and blank face of the mountainous area. People put forward the battle cry of "stopping floods and seeking grain from barren hills", organized mountain management teams and conducted a fierce struggle with nature, and as a result, they overcame wind, snow, and severe cold, tamed floods, and turned barren hills into granaries, using vivid facts to educate those with erroneous ideas. The young mountain management team was tempered into a strong team in the struggle, and they continued to fight to support the mountain and water management movement in the whole county. The theme of the whole play is very clear: Under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the people's soaring enthusiasm, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. The characters in the play, such as: the Party branch secretary of the cooperative, who is principled, approachable; Tian Guilian, the mountain management team leader, who listens to the Party, has great ambitions, and is a girl who dares to think and dare to do; Guilian's grandmother, who is a loving old lady, and whose thinking is not lagging behind the young people who open mountains and break ridges in the era of the Great Leap Forward; the cooperative accountant, who is short-sighted; the rich middle peasant, Lao Mantun, who is selfish and wants to take the capitalist road, etc.; these characters are full of the atmosphere of life and are distinctive. The development of the contradictions in the play is very natural, closely interweaving the struggle against nature and the struggle against backward conservative ideas and the idea of taking the capitalist road, without any traces of artificial fabrication. This script was written by the comrades of Henan Yu Opera Troupe No. 3 through in-depth life, liberating their minds, and giving full play to the wisdom of the masses to carry out collective creation, and it was continuously absorbed opinions and processed and revised during the performance.

From this performance, it can be seen that the traditional skills of opera still play a very important role in expressing today's characters. If the basic skills of actors' singing, acting, body movements, and dancing are well mastered, the actors can be flexible and free on the stage. For example, the several actions of fetching water, carrying soil, and dancing with hoes to express determination, and the several scenes of fighting against the storm in this play all use traditional skills to express the characters' thoughts and feelings. There are many innovative places in the use of traditional skills in this play; the play has added many choruses, such as one person calling and ten thousand people responding, the rich middle peasants spreading loose emotions and everyone questioning him, everyone expressing determination to the Party, and the final victory singing, etc., all expressed in short and powerful choruses. The action is traditional dance movements, and although the music has been innovated, it still maintains the style of Yu opera. The whole thing is unified and coordinated. This kind of chorus expresses that after the Party's ideas are accepted by the masses, it becomes an irresistible force, making the theme of the script more clear and powerful. Comrade Wang Shanfu played the Party branch secretary of the cooperative, who had a clear stand in the struggle, and was kind and touching in his relationship with his daughter and comrades, successfully creating an image of today's firm, simple, and kind Party leader. Tian Guilian, the leader of the mountain management team, is a young girl. She wants to open mountains and break ridges. She has the heroic spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and the ambitious communist style. It is difficult to express her character if using the traditional performance methods of Qingyi Huadan, and it is not entirely appropriate to use the traditional performance methods of Wudan. In this play, Comrade Liu Lanfang, who plays Tian Guilian, creatively used the movements of boys, breaking through the shackles of tradition. When she is in front of her grandmother or chatting with her girlfriend, she is still a naive and lively little girl. She skillfully combines these new creations with traditional skills to create a vivid artistic image.

The entire performance is full of a comedic atmosphere and exudes a spirit of optimism, which makes "Winter Goes, Spring Comes" have a unique style in this performance. When the old grandmother sends Guilian to the mountain, she runs in and out, reminding her again and again, taking this and busy taking that. Her love and care for her granddaughter, and her busyness in running around are full of the joy of life. Although the old grandmother is sixty-three years old, she still wants to exert her own strength in the mountain management work. Later, she went to the mountain headquarters, managed the broadcasting tube and sewed and washed clothes for the team members. She worked conscientiously on the mountain, and each job brought her the joy of life. Comrade Ma Lin's performance meticulously portrayed an optimistic, healthy, loving, and considerate old grandmother of the new era, adding color to the entire performance. The cooperative accountant has a short-sighted vision. He is happy when he hears about buying fertilizer, and he uses the abacus to make two sixes into thirteen, but he is reluctant to issue tools to the mountain management team members. The mountain management team member Yulan quarreled with him, and he was so angry that his feet bounced straight up. Comrade Chen Xinli's accountant made the audience laugh whether he answered the phone or played the abacus. The rich middle peasant Lao Mantun came to the mountain to spread loose emotions, and the girls of the mountain management team wanted him to broaden his horizons, and dragged him to see the fish scale pits dug by the mountain management team to store water. He said they were tombs, and let him see the large ditches that blocked water. He said they were trenches. He stumbled back and forth among a group of heroic girls, becoming a clear comedic contrast. Comrade Zhu Yi's performance of Lao Mantun made people believe that he was a living person with his own life logic, but he was so laughable. The entire performance was integrated with the audience, full of optimistic laughter. From the performance of this play, I deeply felt how much our real life full of the joy of struggle needs comedy! "Winter Goes, Spring Comes," this flower full of earthy flavor and sparkling with morning dew, exudes the joy of the Great Leap Forward and expresses the optimism of communists, giving the audience encouragement. I came to see this good play with the heart of a drama worker learning from the opera tradition. I was very inspired and had many feelings after watching it. I wrote a little bit of my own learning experience as an introduction to it. If I were to offer some advice, it would be that the scene of fighting against the storm still feels slightly insufficiently displayed. If this struggle can more fully express the power of nature and the unstoppable power of human determination to conquer nature, combining the traditional opera dance with lightning and thunder, and even adding some powerful choruses to create a sufficient atmosphere of climax, then the arrival of spring in the latter scene will be even more valuable.

专栏：现代题材戏曲观摩演出评介

    “冬去春来”是一枝带着朝露的鲜花
    孙维世
    在这次现代题材戏曲观摩演出中，在戏曲舞台上涌现一大批新人，他们继承传统，保持了每个剧种的特色，然而又不拘泥于传统，大胆创造，推陈出新的表现了丰富多彩的现实生活，创造了社会主义建设中英雄人物的鲜明形象，给戏曲事业的发展描绘出辉煌的远景！看到戏曲园地上开放出带着朝露的万紫千红的花朵，怎能使人不兴奋，怎不使人为戏曲的跃进之花而欢呼！
    在这美不胜收的现代题材戏曲会演中，我想介绍一下河南豫剧三团演出的“冬去春来”，这是一出好戏。内容是：九龙山区平时旱灾严重，一下起雨来又山洪爆发，冲房淹地势如猛虎，百姓深受其苦。解放后情况虽然好转，但是自然的灾害仍然在威胁着人们。1957年山区人民在党的号召下树雄心立大志要根本改变山区一穷二白的面貌，人们提出了“要洪水止步，向荒山要粮”的战斗口号，组织了治山队和自然进行了一场激烈的斗争，结果战胜了风雪严寒、驯服了洪水，变荒山为粮仓，用生动的事实教育了那些有错误思想的人。青年的治山队在斗争中锻炼成一支坚强的队伍，他们为支援全县的治山治水运动而继续进行斗争。全剧的主题思想很明确：在党的领导下，发挥起群众的冲天干劲，那就没有不能克服的困难。剧中人物如：合作社的支部书记，原则性强而又平易近人；治山队长田桂莲听党的话，有雄心大志，是个敢想敢干的姑娘；桂莲的奶奶是个慈爱的老太太，在大跃进的时代里，她的思想也不落后于开山劈岭的青年人；合作社会计是个目光短浅的人；富裕中农老满囤是个自私自利要走资本主义道路的人等等；这些人物既充满了生活的气息而又色彩鲜明。剧中的矛盾展开的非常自然，把对自然的斗争和对落后保守思想、走资本主义道路思想的斗争紧紧的交织在一起，没有人为虚构的痕迹。这个剧本是河南豫剧三团同志们深入生活，解放思想发挥了群众的智慧进行集体创作写出来的，演出过程中又不断的吸取意见进行了加工修改。
    从这个演出中可以看到戏曲传统的技巧对表现今天的人物来说，还有很重要的作用。演员的唱、做、身段、舞蹈这些基本功夫如果掌握得好，演员在台上就能灵活自如，如这个戏里的挑水、担土、舞镢头表决心的几个动作，与暴风雨作斗争的几个场面都是运用了传统技巧表现了人物的思想感情。这个戏里在运用传统的技巧上有许多革新创造的地方；戏里增加了许多合唱，如一人号召万人响应、富裕中农散布松劲情绪后大家向他质问、大家向党表决心、最后胜利的欢唱等，都是用简短有力的合唱表达出来的。动作上是传统的舞蹈动作，音乐上虽有革新仍保持了豫剧的风格，整个说是统一协调的。这种合唱表达出了党的思想被群众所接受后成为一种不可抗拒的力量，使剧本的主题思想更加鲜明有力。王善甫同志演的合作社支部书记，在斗争中立场鲜明，对待女儿、对待同志的关系上又亲切感人，成功地创造了一个今天的坚定、朴素、亲切的党的领导人的形象。治山队长田桂莲是个年青的姑娘，她要开山，要劈岭，她有不怕困难的英雄气概，有志大心雄的共产主义风格，如果运用传统的青衣花旦的传统表演方法是难于表达出她的性格的，用武旦的传统表演方法也不完全合适，在这个戏里演田桂莲的柳兰芳同志创造性地运用了男孩子的动作，突破了传统的束缚。当她在奶奶跟前或是和女友谈天时，她仍然是个天真活泼的小姑娘，她把这些新的创造和传统的技巧巧妙的结合起来，创造出鲜明的艺术形象。
    整个演出中充满了喜剧的气氛，洋溢着乐观主义的精神，这使得“冬去春来”在这次会演中别具一种风格。老奶奶送桂莲上山时，她跑出跑进，叮咛再叮咛，拿了这样又忙着给拿那样，她对孙女的慈爱、关怀，忙得团团转，充满了生活的喜气。老奶奶虽然六十三岁，她还是想在治山工作中发挥出自己的一分力量，后来她到了山上指挥部，管广播筒和替队员缝洗衣服的工作，她认真负责地在山上工作，每件工作都给她带来生活的喜悦，马琳同志的表演，把一个新时代乐观、健康、慈爱、体贴的老奶奶刻划得细致入微，给整个演出增加了色彩。合作社会计目光短浅，一听说买肥料就高兴，拿起算盘把二六打成一十三，可是他就舍不得给治山队员发工具，治山队员玉兰和他吵了一架，他气得两脚往上直蹦，陈新理同志扮演的会计无论是接个电话，打个算盘都使得观众笑声不绝。富裕中农老满囤到山上来散布松劲情绪，治山队的姑娘们要他开开眼界，拉着他看治山队挖的存水的鱼鳞坑，他说是坟堆，让他看挡水的大沟，他说是战壕，在一群豪迈的姑娘中他蹒跚地走来走去，成为一个鲜明的喜剧的对照，朱义同志演的老满囤，使人相信他就是个活生生的人，有他的生活逻辑，然而又这样使人感到可笑。整个演出和观众打成一片，充满了乐观的笑声，从这个戏的演出中，我深深感到我们充满了斗争乐趣的现实生活是多么需要喜剧呵！“冬去春来”这枝充满泥土气息带着朝露的鲜花，洋溢着大跃进的喜气，表现了共产主义者的乐观主义精神，给了观众以鼓舞。我怀着话剧工作者向戏曲传统学习的心情来看了这个好戏，很受启发，看后的感想很多，写出一点自己学习的心得作为对它的介绍。如果要提点意见的话，就是那场和暴风雨作斗争的戏还稍感展示得不够，这场斗争如果把自然的威力与人定胜天不可阻挡的力量表达得更充分，把戏曲传统的舞蹈和雷电结合起来，甚至可加些有力的合唱把高潮的气氛造足，那后一场春天的到来就更可贵了。
