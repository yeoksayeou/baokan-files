Chairman, fellow representatives:

    We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the Draft 1960 National Budget." The reports made by the two vice premiers on behalf of the State Council to the congress succinctly revealed the great achievements of China's construction in 1959 and the even more magnificent plans for China's construction cause in 1960. We are extremely encouraged and are determined to make our greatest contribution to implement the requirements of the plan.

    We are educators from Shanghai. Like all parts of the country, Shanghai's educational undertakings in 1959, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, implemented the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and "walking on two legs" for the development of educational undertakings. Schools at all levels have seen great development and improvement. Not only have full-time schools seen great development, but also a vigorous mass movement for running schools has been launched.

    In 1959, the number of students in Shanghai's universities and colleges increased by more than 1.74 times compared to 1949, and by approximately 20% compared to 1958. The number of students in ordinary primary and secondary schools and kindergartens increased by 2.9 times compared to 1949, and by 1.47 times compared to 1958. The eighty-two people's communes in the city's five counties already have eighty-six agricultural middle schools with 13,795 students. From liberation until 1958, 1.35 million illiterate people had been eliminated in the city. Since the beginning of November last year to date, more than 360,000 illiterate people have been eliminated. The city currently has 5,152 spare-time primary and secondary schools with more than 710,000 students. According to statistics up to March 14th, 149 spare-time colleges have already been established, with more than 21,000 students, a doubling from last year. In order to meet the current urgent needs of production, some factories have also held various forms of technical short-term training classes. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Higher Education Bureau, Shanghai Television University was also established in March. The city also has twenty-six normal schools with more than 10,000 students. In addition to training a large number of new teachers, higher normal colleges have also done a lot of work in various ways to improve the level of the vast number of in-service teachers.

      The Ideological Outlook of the Broad Masses of Teachers and Students Has Undergone Significant Changes

    Due to the strong leadership of the Party, the implementation of the Party's education policy, and a clear political direction, the ideological outlook of the broad masses of teachers and students in schools at all levels in Shanghai has undergone significant changes. Under the leadership and education of the Party, the broad masses of teachers and students have not only realized the integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, implemented the principles of integrating theory with practice and emphasizing the present over the past, and brought into play the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of teachers and students in teaching, but have also established a new type of teacher-student relationship characterized by teacher-student integration, mutual teaching and learning, and democracy and equality. As a result, the quality of teaching has also been significantly improved.

    In the past year, teachers and students in various liberal arts majors in Shanghai's universities and colleges have developed a strong interest in conducting investigations and research. A large number of new courses on Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works, as well as new courses criticizing bourgeois academic thought, have been offered. Many students (including some lower-grade students) have actively engaged in extensive scientific activities. Professionals in science, engineering, medicine, and other fields have also made considerable achievements in developing modern science, especially cutting-edge science and technology. The broad masses of teachers and students (including some lower-grade students) have closely cooperated with production departments and scientific research institutions, making many achievements in the trial production and design of cutting-edge products. Various universities and colleges have conscientiously implemented the policy of "one major, two auxiliaries, and three combinations," tightly integrating scientific research and productive labor around the requirements of teaching, thereby greatly enriching the content of teaching and improving the quality of teaching.

    The Quality of General Education, Preschool Education, and Spare-Time Education Is Rapidly Improving

    The quality of general education, preschool education, and spare-time education in Shanghai is also rapidly improving. In ordinary middle schools, the teaching of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Chinese language has been significantly strengthened. In order to lay a good foundation for the development of science in universities and colleges, some middle schools have also added some knowledge of important new technologies to the teaching content of mathematics and physics. The extensive development of science and technology activities in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools in the past year has played a significant role in consolidating and expanding students' knowledge, cultivating students' interest in science, further mobilizing students' enthusiasm and creativity in learning, and fostering the integration of theory with practice. In addition to extracurricular institutions such as children's palaces and science and technology stations, nine districts and counties in the city have newly built children's palaces and children's homes. Most middle and primary schools have included science and technology activities in their school work plans, arranged activity time, and established various science and technology groups. Because agricultural middle schools closely integrate teaching with productive labor and theory with practice, the quality of teaching has generally improved rapidly. The crops planted in agricultural middle schools generally exceed the average yield in the local area, becoming a banner of high yields, attracting the attention of cadres and the masses. Many communes have begun to regard agricultural middle schools as bases for technology promotion, enabling agricultural middle schools to further play the role of technology promotion stations. The members of the Liuzhao People's Commune in Shanghai even boasted about the agricultural middle school, saying: "Agricultural middle school, agricultural middle school, plays a big role, can do both literary and martial arts, proficient in everything!"

      Achievements and Experiences Gained in Private Primary Schools and Kindergartens

    Private primary schools and kindergartens in Shanghai have also been working hard in the past year, resolutely implementing the Party's policies and gaining achievements and experiences. Wu Peifang and two other housewives from the Jianxiang Residents' Committee in Xuhui District responded to the Party's call for private schools, starting from scratch and without spending a penny of the state's money, and established a private school. Due to Wu Peifang's infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and her wholehearted service to the people, teaching while learning, and overcoming many difficulties, the school has gradually improved its teaching quality, and the students' grades are no lower than those of public schools, and has become a banner for private primary schools in Shanghai and the whole country. There are many such private primary schools and kindergartens in Shanghai that try every means, wholeheartedly, serve production, accommodate the convenience of parents, do not care about remuneration, and do not talk about conditions, taking the education of children as their glorious responsibility.

    In his report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun clearly put forward the plan for scientific research and cultural, educational, and health undertakings in China in 1960. The report pointed out that in terms of education, in 1960, the number of students enrolled in various types of schools should be expanded; while developing full-time and part-time school education, spare-time education should be universally and vigorously developed; the integration of education, productive labor, and scientific research should be further strengthened; and efforts should be made to learn, study, and master the world's latest scientific and technological achievements, summarize the rich experience of mass practice, and strive to achieve the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period of time, and so on. This is a plan for continued leap forward. As far as Shanghai is concerned, this leap forward plan is also completely suitable. Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report pointed out that in order to actively support the high-speed development of production and construction, and at the same time actively support the high-speed development of cultural, educational, health, and scientific undertakings, the national social, cultural, educational, and scientific expenditure in 1960 will increase by 47.1% over the previous year, and the proportion of economic construction and cultural construction expenditure in the 1960 budget will reach 81.9%. Under such a great situation, implementing the 1960 plan, China's education cause, Shanghai's education cause, will surely achieve greater and better achievements.

    The Main Tasks of Shanghai's Education Work This Year

    Currently, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is sweeping across China and Shanghai with overwhelming momentum and irresistible force. Like the working people of the whole country, the working people of Shanghai, with the ambition of "conquering the earth and building a strong country," are fiercely attacking the key points of production, striving to transform Shanghai into one of the modern industrial cities and to manufacture high-grade, precise, cutting-edge, and novel products. This has raised many new issues for Shanghai's education cause. Shanghai's educators are facing a task of great development, great popularization, and great improvement, which requires not only a great development of education undertakings, but also a vigorous improvement of the quality of education.

    According to the spirit of the Shanghai Municipal Committee's cultural and educational work conference in February this year, the main tasks of Shanghai's education work in the next few years are to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy in 1960, to complete the popularization of adult spare-time education during the second five-year plan period, and to lay the foundation for cultivating sufficient high- and middle-level technical personnel during the third five-year plan period; universities and colleges should rapidly develop important disciplines that are lacking, especially cutting-edge disciplines; rapidly develop and cultivate a Marxist-Leninist theoretical team; continue to implement the policy of integrating theory with practice, closely integrate with production, and extensively carry out mass scientific research activities; improve scientific level, and strive to climb the peak of world science and technology; and vigorously improve the quality of education work, comprehensively consider the adjustment and innovation of curriculum settings and education content of universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and reflect the new achievements in modern science in the curriculum, and so on.

    The major victories achieved by Shanghai's education undertakings in the past year, like the major victories achieved by all parts of the country and all fronts, are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Party's General Line. It is precisely by taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, implementing the Party's policies formulated based on Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely relying on the strength and wisdom of the masses that schools of all levels and types in Shanghai can achieve vigorous development and continuous improvement. The development and improvement of Shanghai's education undertakings fully prove that Chairman Mao's thought and Chairman Mao's education thought are completely correct, and fully prove the unparalleled power of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out: "The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Conscientiously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future." Conscientiously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is also completely the fundamental guarantee for the great development, great popularization, and great improvement of Shanghai's education cause in the future. We Shanghai education workers must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, conscientiously study Chairman Mao's education thought, and advance along the road of being both red and expert and constantly achieving victory. The tasks before us are indeed glorious and arduous. As long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the red banner of the General Line, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and constantly improve our own political and ideological awareness and scientific and cultural level, we can not only run education undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way, but also improve the quality of teaching in a faster, better, and more economical way.

专栏：

    上海市教育事业的重大胜利
    陈望道、孟宪承、廖世承、吴若安、苏步青、周志宏、左淑东代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理
  “关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。两位副总理代表国务院向大会所作的报告，简括扼要地揭示了1959年我国建设的伟大成就，和1960年我国建设事业的更加宏伟的计划，我们感到极其振奋，决心为贯彻执行计划的要求，作出我们最大的贡献。
    我们是上海的教育工作者。和全国各地一样，1959年上海市的教育事业，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在中共上海市委的正确领导下，贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合以及发展教育事业的“两条腿走路”的方针，各级学校都有很大的发展和提高。不仅全日制学校有了很大的发展，同时也展开了蓬蓬勃勃的群众性的办学运动。
    1959年，全市高等学校学生比1949年增长一点七四倍以上，比1958年增长约20％。普通中小学和幼儿园学生，比1949年增长二点九倍，比1958年增长一点四七倍。全市五个县八十二个人民公社，已有农业中学八十六所，学生一万三千七百九十五人。从解放以来到1958年为止，全市已经扫除了文盲一百三十五万人。从去年11月初到目前，又扫除了文盲三十六万余人。全市现有业余中小学五千一百五十二所，学员七十一万余人。根据3月14日以前的统计，举办的业余高等学校已经达到一百四十九所，学员二万一千余人，比去年翻了一番。为了适应当前生产迫切的需要，还有一些工厂举办了各种形式的技术短训班。在中共上海市委和市高教局领导下，上海电视大学也已在3月成立。全市还有师范学校二十六所，学生一万余人。高等师范院校，除培养大批新师资以外，在提高广大在职师资的水平方面，也以多种多样方式，进行了不少工作。
      广大师生的思想面
        貌有了显著的变化
    上海市各级学校，由于有了党的坚强领导，贯彻执行党的教育方针，有了明确的政治方向，广大师生的思想面貌已经有了显著的变化。广大师生不仅在党的领导和教育下，实现了教学、生产劳动、科学研究的三结合，贯彻了理论联系实际、厚今薄古的原则，发挥了师生在教学中的高度积极性和创造性，而且已经建立了师生结合、教学相长、民主平等的新型的师生关系，教学质量也因而有了显著的提高。
    一年来，上海高等学校文科各专业的师生，从事调查研究，已经蔚成风气；已经开出了大批研究关于马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东著作的新课和批判资产阶级学术思想的新课；很多学生（包括一部分低年级学生在内）积极投入了广泛的科学活动。理、工、医等科的专业，在发展现代科学、特别是尖端科学技术方面，也取得了不少成就，广大师生（也包括一部分
  低年级学生在内）与生产部门和科学研究机关密切协作，在试制、设计尖端产品方面，作出了许多成绩。各高等学校认真贯彻了“一主二辅三结合”的方针，把科学研究、劳动生产紧紧围绕着教学的要求拧成一体，从而大大地充实了教学的内容，提高了教学的质量。
  普通教育、幼儿教育和业余教
        育的质量迅速提高
    上海市普通教育、幼儿教育和业余教育的质量也正在迅速提高。普通中学里，数理化和语文的教学已有了显著的加强。为了替高等学校科学发展打好基础，有些中学在数学、物理教学内容方面，还增加了若干重要的新技术方面的知识；一年来上海市中小学的科技活动的广泛开展，对巩固和扩大学生的知识，培养学生对科学的兴趣爱好，进一步发动学生的学习积极性和创造性，并在培养理论联系实际方面，也起了很大的作用。全市除少年宫、少年科技站等校外机构外，目前有九个区、县新建了少年宫、少年之家。大部分中、小学已将科技活动列入学校工作计划，安排活动时间，建立了各种科技小组。农业中学由于教学紧密结合生产劳动，理论联系实际，教学质量一般也提高很快。农中所种的农作物，一般都超过当地的平均产量，成为高额丰产的旗帜，引起了干部、群众的重视。不少公社开始把农中当作技术推广的据点，使农中进一步发挥技术推广站的作用。上海六灶人民公社的社员并且夸耀农中说：“农中农中，大有作用，能文能武，样样精通！”
      民办小学和幼儿园
        获得了成就和经验
    上海市民办小学、幼儿园一年来也鼓足干劲，坚决贯彻党的方针政策，获得了成就和经验。徐汇区建襄居民委员会吴佩芳等三个家庭妇女，响应党的民办学校的号召，赤手空拳，没有花国家一文钱，创办了一所民办学校。这所学校由于吴佩芳对革命事业无限忠诚，全心全意为人民服务，边学边教，克服了许多困难，逐步提高了教学质量，学生成绩不低于公立学校水平，已成为上海市和全国民办小学的一面旗帜。像这样千方百计，全心全意，为生产服务，服从家长的方便，不计报酬，不讲条件的民办小学、幼儿园，把教养好孩子作为他们光荣的职责，在上海不在少数。
    李富春副总理在报告中，明确提出了1960年我国科学研究和文教卫生事业的计划。报告指出，在教育事业方面，1960年要扩大各类学校招生数字；要在发展全日制、半日制学校教育的同时，普遍大力发展业余教育；要进一步密切教育、生产劳动、科学研究三者之间的结合；以及要努力学习、研究和掌握世界上最新的科学技术成就，总结群众实践的丰富经验，为争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学技术规划而奋斗等等。这是一个继续跃进的计划。以上海的情况来说，这个跃进计划也是完全适合的。李先念副总理的报告指出，为了在积极支持高速度发展生产建设的同时，积极支持文教卫生和科学事业的高速度发展，1960年全国社会文教和科学费比上年增长47.1％，经济建设和文化建设的开支，在1960年预算中所占的比重达到81.9％。在这样大好形势之下，贯彻执行1960年计划，我国教育事业、上海教育事业，一定可以得到更大更好的成就。
    今年上海市教育工作的主要任务
    目前，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，激荡着全中国，激荡着全上海。上海劳动人民同全国劳动人民一样，胸怀“战胜地球、建立强国”的雄心壮志，猛攻生产关键，要把上海变成为现代化的工业城市之一，要制造出高级、精密、尖端、新颖的产品。这就为上海教育事业，提出了许多新的课题。上海市的教育工作者，正面对着一个大发展、大普及、大提高的任务，既要使教育事业有很大的发展，又要大力地提高教育的质量。
    根据今年2月上海市委文教工作会议的精神，今后几年内，上海教育工作的主要任务是，在1960年内完成扫盲任务，在第二个五年计划期间，完成普及成人的业余教育，为在第三个五年计划期内培养出足够的高、中级技术人员打下基础；高等学校要把缺门的重要学科，特别是尖端学科迅速地发展起来；迅速发展和培养马克思列宁主义的理论队伍；继续贯彻理论联系实际的方针，密切结合生产，广泛开展群众性的科学研究活动；提高科学水平，努力攀登世界科学技术高峰；以及大力提高教育工作质量，通盘考虑大、中、小学课程设置与教育内容的调整和革新，把现代科学上的新成就反映到课程中去等等。
    上海市教育事业在过去一年中所取得的重大胜利，和全国各地各条战线所取得的重大胜利一样，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，正是以毛泽东思想为指导，贯彻执行了依据毛泽东思想所制定的党的方针政策，坚决依靠群众的力量和智慧，上海市各级各类学校才能得到蓬勃的发展和不断的提高。上海市教育事业的发展、提高，充分证明了毛主席的思想、毛主席的教育思想完全正确，充分证明了党的社会主义建设总路线的无比威力。
    李富春副总理指出：“毛泽东思想的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜。认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。”认真学习和掌握毛泽东思想，也完全是上海教育事业今后大发展、大普及、大提高的根本保证。我们上海教育工作者，一定要认真学习毛主席的著作，认真学习毛主席的教育思想，沿着又红又专、不断胜利的道路前进。我们面前的任务的确是光荣而艰巨的。只要我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，总路线的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不断提高我们自己的政治思想觉悟和科学文化水平，我们就既可以多快好省地办教育事业，也可以多快好省地提高教学质量。（附图片）
