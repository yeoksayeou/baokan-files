To the Presidium and all representatives:

We have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft. The two vice premiers' summaries of the 1959 work are completely correct. The 1960 National Economic Plan is a plan that better implements the Party's General Line for socialist construction and achieves a comprehensive and continued leap forward. It is also a plan that can be completed and overfulfilled with effort. It has once again given us a profound education in the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. It has given us tremendous encouragement, further enhanced our understanding, clarified our direction, and strengthened our confidence. We fully endorse the reports and suggest that the Congress approve them and resolutely implement them in our future work. We are all coal industry workers and will briefly report on the situation of the coal industry in Liaoning Province, and please correct us.

I. The Party's Socialist Construction General Line Shines Radiantly, and Liaoning's Coal Industry Has Achieved Brilliant Success.

Under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and the local Party and government departments, with the selfless assistance of the great allied nation, the Soviet Union, and with the strong support of various relevant departments, the coal industry in our province has achieved brilliant success through the efforts of all employees. Over the past ten years, the output of raw coal has increased more than eight times, and the output of washed coking coal fines has increased 17.5 times. Since 1958, under the correct leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, the employees of the coal industry in our province have adhered to putting politics in command, breaking down superstitions, liberating their minds, implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" management method, breaking the outdated rules and regulations that restrict the development of productive forces, and displaying a high degree of revolutionary drive and selfless labor enthusiasm. As a result, raw coal production in 1958 was 167.7% of 1957, and 1959 was 127.3% of 1958. The output of washed coking coal fines in 1958 was 164.2% of 1957, and 1959 was 129.2% of 1958. This not only basically met the needs of industry, transportation, and civilian coal in our province but also ensured the Great Leap Forward of our province's steel enterprises and supported the coal use of steel enterprises in other provinces. It realized the grand ambition advocated by all coal employees, "Fighting for coal to guarantee steel."

The capital construction of the coal industry in our province has also achieved great victories. In the four old mining areas of Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, in addition to restoring and extensively renovating the original mines and open-pit mines, modern Caitun Shaft, Ping'an Shaft, Xinqiu Shaft, Haizhou Open-Pit, and Fushun East Open-Pit, as well as many small and medium-sized mines, have been newly built, thus giving full play to the role of the old bases.

In 1958, all capital construction employees, with revolutionary drive and overcoming various difficulties, newly built 44 mines with a designed capacity of 15.52 million tons, which is 6.12 times the total capacity of new mines built during the First Five-Year Plan. Within one year, four new mining areas, Shenbei, Tiefa, Nanpiao, and Hepingzhuang, were opened up. At the same time, the policy of "walking on two legs" was implemented, and a small-scale indigenous mass movement was launched, with the construction of small coal kilns almost covering all counties in the province. In 1959, the scale of construction remained grand, with a designed capacity of 22.22 million tons. Based on the principles of consolidation, strengthening, and improvement, the small coal kilns were subjected to five fixings (fixed type, fixed location, fixed personnel, fixed organization, and fixed leadership) and technical transformation, gradually developing from small-scale indigenous groups to small-scale foreign groups. Such a scale of construction and speed of development are unprecedented.

Coalfield geological exploration employees also broke down superstitions and mustered their energy. The reserves explored in 1958, both detailed and general, were 1.6 times the amount explored during the First Five-Year Plan.

Designers broke conventions, actively collected data, and went deep into the field to listen to the opinions of relevant personnel, drawing construction drawings on the spot, which greatly accelerated the design speed and improved design quality.

The employees of the coal industry promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, worked hard and practically, and skillfully carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and promoted effective advanced experiences. With the strong assistance of research departments and universities, many new technologies and cutting-edge technologies were researched and tested. According to incomplete statistics, 68 items were awarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1958, and there were more than 10,000 technical innovation and technical revolution projects in 1959. The cutting-edge and new technologies realized in the past two years include hydraulic hoisting in Fushun, heavy medium coal preparation in Beipiao, pick-type coal loader in Fuxin, automation of coal preparation plants in Benxi, and automation of drilling rigs in geological exploration. These reforms have played a huge role in tapping production potential and accelerating construction speed, and have greatly changed the technical appearance of the coal industry in our province.

In 1959, a vigorous large-scale high-yield red flag competition movement was launched, achieving remarkable results. In the national coal mine evaluation, our province won the large-scale high-yield red flag of the Ministry of Coal Industry. The Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao Mining Bureaus, the Geological Bureau, and various development offices won 46 large-scale high-yield, high-yield red flags, satellite award flags, and rocket award flags in production, construction, coal washing, and transportation, and 77 certificates of merit. The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute won the large-scale high-yield, high-quality red flag, and the Fushun Coal Science Research Institute won invention and creation certificates and award flags. In short, the coal industry in our province has achieved brilliant achievements in production, construction, exploration, design, and scientific research. This eloquently proves that 1958 was a year of exceptionally great leaps forward, and 1959 was a year of continued leaps forward on the basis of 1958. The 1960 plan is to increase raw coal production by 13.1% compared to the actual output in 1959, and the scale of construction will increase by 5% compared to 1959. In the first year of the 1960s, there was an unprecedented creation in the history of coal mines, not only maintaining production as usual during the New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, but also achieving a good start, a red start every month, and a complete red start in the first quarter, laying a favorable foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward this year. These brilliant achievements are the victory of the Party's correct leadership, the victory of the General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, the victory of the Great Leap Forward and the mass movement, and even more so, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

II. Launch a New Upsurge of Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution with the Five Major Revolutions as the Main Direction

The coal industry in our province has achieved brilliant successes. Although production has increased rapidly every year, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the rapid development of industry, agriculture, and transportation in our province. The main technical and economic indicators have not been completed comprehensively and excellently. These two major problems must be solved quickly by the coal employees in our province, and it is our unshirkable responsibility. This requires continuing to vigorously tap the production potential of existing enterprises and develop new mining areas and construct new mines on a large scale and at a high speed.

In order to tap the production potential of existing enterprises and accelerate the construction of new mines, it is necessary to launch an even more vigorous and magnificent upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution, concentrate superior forces, and carry out major revolutions in the following five aspects:

(1) Accelerate the progress of tunneling, mining, mine construction, and drilling.

Accelerating various progress can improve production levels, shorten construction periods, improve labor productivity, reduce consumption, and lower costs. This requires not only vigorously promoting advanced experience and actively researching and adopting world advanced technology, but also boldly creating new technologies suitable for specific conditions and with good results. At the same time, it is also necessary to try every possible means to break through the existing progress records to ensure the over-fulfillment of the plan.

(2) Liberate heavy manual labor.

For the existing heavy manual labor operations, vigorously promote mechanization, semi-mechanization, indigenous mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulicization, and semi-hydraulicization. The liberation of heavy manual labor and the improvement of labor productivity should ensure that old mines increase production without increasing personnel, and personnel can be transferred to support new mining areas. Depending on different conditions, needs, and possibilities, if foreign methods can be used, then use foreign methods; if not, then use indigenous methods. The main focus should be on self-reliance, researching, creating, and widely adopting mechanical equipment that is simple in structure, lightweight and durable, easy to manufacture, low in cost, convenient to operate, and highly effective, such as the pick-type coal loader in Fuxin.

(3) Reform coal mining methods.

Coal mining methods are the most important link in the coal industry and the main factor determining the success or failure of enterprise management. This revolution should adhere to the principles of large output, high efficiency, simple processes, good safety, low material consumption, and rational resource recovery. Consider adopting hydraulic mining and hydraulic transportation, dry mining and hydraulic transportation, and hydraulic mining and dry transportation. At the same time, different dry mining methods should be considered based on the coal seam inclination, thickness, coal quality, and roof and floor conditions. For example, for coal seams with an inclination of more than 30°, soft coal quality, and good roof and floor conditions, the steel wire saw coal mining method can be used. For hard coal quality and good roof conditions, the short-wall deep-hole blasting coal mining method or the bin-pillar coal mining method can be used. Regardless of the hardness of the coal quality and poor roof conditions, the shielded support coal mining method can be used. For coal seams with an inclination of less than 30°, soft coal quality, thin coal seams, and good roof conditions, the steel wire saw coal mining method can also be used. For soft coal quality, poor roof conditions, thick coal seams, and extra-thick coal seams, the full-height mining method can be used. For medium-thick coal seams with poor roof conditions, the shielded support coal mining method can be used. For coal seams with hard coal quality and good roof conditions, the knife-pillar coal mining method can be used. In order to protect ground buildings, reduce resource losses, and prevent spontaneous combustion and gas explosions, the water-sand filling coal mining method or the comprehensive coal mining method can be used for extra-thick coal seams. Open-pit mines should focus on improving the efficiency of electric shovels and carry out revolutions in related processes. Hydraulic stripping, hydraulic coal transportation, or auger coal mining methods can be used where conditions permit.

(4) Simplify processes and job types.

Simplifying technological processes, changing multi-step processes to fewer processes, and changing multi-job types to fewer job types are important ways to increase coal mine output, accelerate construction speed, improve working conditions, and improve labor productivity. In addition to vigorously promoting the three-no working faces (no workers, no supports, and no chutes) and hydraulic mining, and creating various new technological processes, the existing technological processes should be studied in detail to find simplification methods.

(5) Use less, substitute, or eliminate pit props.

Pit prop consumption accounts for a large proportion of wood consumption in our country, and coal production is constantly increasing, and we should not cut down a large number of trees that have not yet become timber. We must reform coal mining methods, use pit props rationally, and strengthen recycling and reuse, so we can use less pit props. Promoting 60-type props, slag props, ceramsite props, cement props, metal props, magnesite props, and rubble masonry supports can achieve substitution and elimination of pit props.

III. In order to achieve the above five major revolutions, we have taken the following measures:

1. Resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for successfully completing the five major revolutions.

2. Trust the masses and launch a large-scale mass movement. The wisdom and strength of the masses are endless. As long as we fully mobilize the masses and clearly explain the purpose of the five major revolutions to the employees, we will surely obtain the most effective revolutionary methods.

3. Set up full-time technical revolution leadership institutions at each level to be responsible for proposing topics, making plans, and organizing relevant units and employees to research and solve problems. Give encouragement and support to innovations or creations from the masses, and help summarize and improve them. Whether it is the experience of this unit or the advanced experience at home and abroad, it should be quickly promoted in combination with specific conditions. With the new achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution, the production organization, labor organization, and outdated rules and regulations should be changed accordingly.

4. Better implement the three combinations inside and outside. The internal three combinations are: the combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians. The external three combinations are: the combination of research institutions, universities, and production or construction units.

5. Break down superstitions, liberate the mind, and combine the unique style of daring to think and daring to act with scientific analysis. Engineering and technical personnel must especially abandon old restraints, boldly conceive and create, establish great ambitions, and set high goals. What others can do, we must do. What others have not done, we must also do.

Finally, we would like to express to the Congress that we will resolutely listen to the Party, go wherever the Party points us, and have the determination and confidence to do our work well. After returning, we will report the spirit of the Congress to the leaders and convey it to the employees. In accordance with Vice Premier Li's instructions, each factory and mine will be linked to the People's Commune, so that industry can vigorously support agriculture. The advanced experiences introduced by the representatives will be quickly promoted in combination with specific conditions. We will strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works in order to continuously transform our thinking and resolutely implement the Party's policies. In the new upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we, together with the coal industry employees of the entire province, will resolutely oppose right-leaning, greatly boost our energy, actively carry out the five major revolutions, and break through the eighteen cutting-edge technologies proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry. Vigorously tap the production potential of existing enterprises and accelerate the speed of capital construction. We will strive to overfulfill the 1960 production and construction plan, to continuously refresh the main technical and economic indicators, and to ensure the continued Great Leap Forward of the coal industry in Liaoning in the future.

    二、解放笨重体力劳动；
    三、改革采煤方法；
    四、简化工序和工种；
    五、少用、代用或不用坑木。
    费广泰、庞观祥、王恒成、凤冠绥代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我们听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。两位副总理对1959年工作总结是完全正确的，1960年国民经济计划是更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，全面继续跃进的计划；又是经过努力可以完成和超额完成的计划。使我们又一次受到了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的深刻教育，给我们巨大的鼓舞，进一步提高了认识，明确了方向，增强了信心。对于报告我们表示完全拥护，并建议大会通过和在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。我们都是煤炭工业工作者，仅将辽宁省煤炭工业情况，简单汇报如下，并请指正。
    一、党的社会主义建设总路线光芒万丈，辽宁煤炭工业成就辉煌
    我省煤炭工业在煤炭工业部、省委、省人委和各地党政部门的正确领导下，在伟大盟邦苏联的无私援助下，在各有关部门的大力支援下，经过全体职工的努力，取得了辉煌的成就。十年来原煤产量增长八倍多，炼焦用洗煤粉增长十七点五倍。1958年以来，我省煤炭工业职工在党的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，坚持了政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想，贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的管理方法，打破了束缚生产力发展的陈规戒律，发挥了高度的革命干劲和忘我的劳动热情。从而使原煤产量1958年为1957年的167.7％，1959年为1958年的127.3％。炼焦用洗煤粉产量，1958年为1957年的164.2％，1959年为1958年的129.2％。这不仅基本上满足了我省工业交通和民用煤的需要，并保证了我省钢铁企业的大跃进和支援了外省钢铁企业的部分用煤。实现了全体煤炭职工的倡议，和“为煤而战以煤保钢”的宏伟志愿。
    我省煤炭工业的基本建设，也取得了巨大胜利，在抚顺、阜新、本溪和北票四个老矿区，除进行恢复和大规模改建原有矿井和露天矿井外，并新建了现代化的采屯立井、平安立井、新丘立井、海州露天和抚顺东露天以及很多中小型矿井，因而充分发挥了老基地的作用。
    1958年基本建设全体职工，鼓足革命干劲，克服各种困难，新建矿井四十四处，设计能力达一千五百五十二万吨，为第一个五年计划中新建矿井总能力的六点一二倍。一年内开辟了沈北、铁法、南票、和平庄四个新矿区。同时贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针，开展小土群运动，新开小煤窑，几乎遍及全省各县。1959年建设规模，仍然宏大，设计能力为二千二百二十二万吨，对小煤窑根据整顿、巩固、提高的原则，进行了定型、定点、定员、定组织、定领导的五定和技术改造工作，由小土群逐步向小洋群方向发展。这样的建设规模和发展速度是史无前例的。
    煤田地质勘探职工，同样破除了迷信，鼓足了干劲，在1958年探得的精查和普查储量，为第一个五年计划中探得的一点六倍。
    设计人员打破常规，主动搜集资料，深入现场听取有关人员的意见，就地作施工图，大大加快了设计速度和提高了设计质量。
    煤炭工业职工发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，苦干实干加巧干，大闹技术革新和技术革命，推广行之有效的先进经验。在研究部门高等院校的大力协助下，研究试行了很多新技术和尖端技术。据不完全统计1958年获得煤炭工业部奖励的有六十八项，1959年的技术革新和技术革命项目有万余件，两年来实现的尖端技术和新技术，有抚顺的水力提升，北票的重介质选煤，阜新的擢锹机，本溪的选煤厂自动化，和地质勘探的钻机自动化等。这些改革对挖掘生产潜力和加快建设速度起了巨大作用，并大大地改变了我省煤炭工业的技术面貌。
    1959年开展了轰轰烈烈的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动，取得了显著成绩。全国煤矿评比结果，我省获得煤炭工业部大面积高产红旗。抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票矿务局、地质局和各开发处获得生产、建设、洗煤、运输等大面积高额丰产红旗，大面积高产红旗，卫星奖旗和火箭奖旗共四十六面，奖状七十七张。沈阳煤矿设计院获得大面积高产优质红旗，抚顺煤炭科学研究院获得发明创造奖状奖旗等。总之，我省煤炭工业，在生产、建设、勘探、设计、科学研究等方面，都取得了辉煌的成就。这就雄辩地证明了1958年是特大跃进的一年，1959年是在1958年的基础上继续大跃进的一个年度，1960年计划生产原煤产量较1959年实际增长13.1％，建设规模较1959年增长5％。在这二十世纪六十年代的第一年，出现了煤矿有史以来的创举，不仅元旦和春节照常生产，还作到开门红、月月红、首季满堂红，为今年持续大跃进打下了有利基础。这些辉煌成就，是党的正确领导的胜利，是总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的胜利，是大跃进和大搞群众运动的胜利，更是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    二、掀起以五大革命为主攻方向的技术革新和技术革命新高潮
    我省煤炭工业已取得辉煌成就，在产量方面，每年虽飞跃增长，但尚不能充分满足我省工农业和交通运输业迅速发展的需要。主要技术经济指标，完成得还不够全面出色。这两大问题，是我省煤炭职工必需很快解决的，也是责无旁贷的。这就要继续大力挖掘现有企业生产潜力，大规模地高速度地开发新矿区，建设新矿井。
    为了挖掘现有企业生产潜力和加速新井建设，必需掀起一个声势更加浩大、规模更加壮阔的技术革新和技术革命新高潮，集中优势兵力，向下列五方面进行大革命。
      （一）加快掘进、回采、建井和钻探进度。
    加快各种进度，就可提高生产水平，缩短建设工期，提高劳动生产率，减少消耗，降低成本。这不仅要大力推广先进经验，积极研究采用世界先进技术，还要大胆创造适合具体条件、效果较好的新技术，同时也要千方百计地突破现有各项进度纪录，以保证计划的超额完成。
      （二）解放笨重体力劳动。
    对现有笨重体力劳动的操作，大力推行机械化，半机械化，土机械化，自动化，半自动化，水力化，半水力化。将解放笨重的体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，作到老矿增产不增人，并调出人员支援新矿区。根据不同条件，以及需要与可能，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，主要采用自力更生的办法，研究创造和广泛采用结构简单，轻便耐用，制造容易，成本低廉，操作方便，效果较高，极易推广的机械设备，如阜新的擢锹机等。
      （三）改革采煤方法。
    采煤方法，是煤炭工业中最重要的一环，是决定企业经营好坏的主要因素。这项革命应以达到产量大，效率高，工序简，安全好，材料消耗少，资源回收合理为原则。考虑采用水采水运，旱采水运，水采旱运，同时应根据煤层倾斜，厚度，煤质软硬，顶底板好坏，考虑采用不同的旱采方法。如倾斜30°以上的煤层，煤质软而顶底板较好的可用钢绳锯采煤法。煤质硬而顶板较好的，可用短壁深孔爆破采煤法，或仓柱式采煤法。无论煤质软硬，而顶板不好的，可用掩护支架采煤法。倾斜三十度以下的煤层，如煤质软煤层薄，而顶板好的，也可用钢绳锯采煤法。煤质软顶板不好的厚煤层和特厚煤层可用一次采全高的采煤法。顶板不好的中厚煤层，可用掩护支架采煤法。煤质硬顶板好的煤层，可用刀柱式采煤法。为了保护地面建筑物，或减少资源损失，和防止自然发火，及瓦斯爆炸，对特厚煤层可用水砂充填采煤法，或综合采煤法。露天矿应以提高电铲效率为中心，进行有关工序的革命，有条件的可进行水力剥离，水力运煤，或螺旋钻采煤法。
    （四）简化工序和工种。
    简化工艺过程，变多工序为少工序，变多工种为少工种，是增加煤矿产量，加快建设速度，改善劳动条件，提高劳动生产率的重要途径。除根据条件大力推广无人、无支架、无溜子的三无工作面，水力采煤，创造各种新的工艺过程外，对现行各项工艺过程，应详加研究，求得简化办法。
    （五）少用代用和不用坑木。
    坑木消耗占我国木材消耗的很大比重，煤炭产量不断增长，更不应大量砍伐尚未成材的树木。我们要改革采煤方法，合理使用坑木，加强回收和复用，就可少用坑木。推广60型支柱，炉碴支柱，陶粒支柱，水泥支柱，金属支柱，菱苦土支柱，和毛料石砌?等，就可作到代用和不用坑木。
      三、为了实现上述五大革命，我们采取下列措施：
    1、坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是胜利完成五大革命的根本保证。
    2、相信群众，大搞群众运动。群众的智慧和力量，是无穷无尽的，只要我们充分发动群众，把五大革命的目的，向职工群众交待清楚，必定获得最有效的革命办法。
    3、逐级设置领导技术革命的专职机构，负责提出课题，作出规划，组织有关单位职工群众，研究解决。对来自群众中的革新或创造，给予鼓励和支持，帮助总结和提高；无论本单位的经验，或国内外的先进经验，都要结合具体情况迅速推广。随着技术革新和技术革命的新成就，要相适应的改变生产组织，劳动组织，和改革已经不适用的规章制度。
    4、更好地执行内外三结合。内部三结合是：领导干部、工人和技术人员的三结合，外部三结合是：研究机关、高等院校和生产或建设单位的三结合。
    5、破除迷信，解放思想，把敢想敢干的独特风格和科学分析结合起来。工程技术人员特别要抛弃旧的束缚，大胆设想和创造，树雄心，立大志，人家能作到的事，我们要作到，人家没作到的事，我们也要作到。
    最后我们向大会表示，坚决听党的话，党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里，有决心和信心，作好我们的工作。回去后把大会精神向领导汇报，并向职工群众传达。遵照李副总理的指示，各厂矿与人民公社挂钩，作到工业大力支援农业。把各位代表介绍的先进经验，结合具体情况，迅速推广。对马列主义和毛主席的著作，要加强学习，以不断改造思想、坚决执行党的方针政策。在技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮中，我们和全省煤炭工业职工一道，狠反右倾，大鼓干劲，积极进行五大革命，并突破煤炭工业部提出的十八项尖端技术。大力挖掘现有企业生产潜力，加快基本建设速度。为超额完成1960年生产和建设计划，为不断刷新各项主要技术经济指标，为保证辽宁煤炭工业今后持续大跃进而奋斗。
