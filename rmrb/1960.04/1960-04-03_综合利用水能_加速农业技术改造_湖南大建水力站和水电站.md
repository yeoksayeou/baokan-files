    Comprehensively Utilize Water Energy to Accelerate Agricultural Technological Transformation
    Hunan Vigorously Builds Hydraulic and Hydroelectric Stations
    (Our dispatch) A mass movement of broad rural people's communes in Hunan Province to vigorously utilize water energy comprehensively and to build hydraulic stations and hydroelectric stations is flourishing. According to current incomplete statistics, the province has already built and put into production 42,712 hydraulic stations, with 140,314 horsepower; 370 hydroelectric stations have been built, with an installed capacity of 9,429 kilowatts. This is equivalent to adding more than 1.12 million laborers to agriculture every day for the entire province. People praise hydraulic stations as "Thoroughbreds that don't eat fodder." They enable machinery to replace the thousands upon thousands of heavy physical labor and manual operations in rural areas, powerfully promoting the production of agriculture, animal husbandry, processing industry, and commune-run industry. This has great and far-reaching significance for accelerating agricultural technological transformation.
    Hunan Province has extremely rich water resources. In addition to the four major rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li, there are also 2,842 large and small tributaries, with streams and channels crisscrossing the land. In recent years, Party organizations at all levels have led the masses to develop and utilize water resources, achieving good results. This year, in order to meet the needs of the great development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and agricultural and sideline product processing industries, the Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to earnestly summarize their experiences and further vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of water energy, rapidly launching a province-wide upsurge of comprehensive water energy utilization by all the people. The hydraulic and hydroelectric stations that have been built and put into production have played a huge role in developing production. For example, Shaoyang Prefecture has put into production 26,288 hydraulic stations, totaling approximately 68,604 horsepower, which can save more than 510,000 laborers. After the "March 8th" breeding farm of the Shuidongdi Commune in Lianyuan County established a hydraulic station, the number of breeders was reduced from 89 to 12, and the number of pigs increased from more than 500 to more than 2,700. For example, a hydraulic grass cutter and concentrated feed grinder operated by two people replaced the manual labor of 48 people.
    In the vigorous promotion of comprehensive water energy utilization, under the correct leadership of the Party, all localities have launched vigorous mass movements, closely relying on the masses, relying on their own efforts, and using local materials to build stations. Therefore, development has been rapid, and a new situation of "one blossom leads to blossoms everywhere" has emerged. Under the inspiring slogan of "Conquering poor mountains and evil waters, turning poor mountains into rich mountains, making small streams obey orders, and using water power to replace manpower," the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture fully mobilized the masses. In just over a month, the prefecture built 2,173 hydraulic stations, equivalent to 13,038 horsepower.
    In the development of comprehensive water energy utilization, all localities have paid attention to combining irrigation, shipping, and power, creating favorable conditions for agricultural technological transformation. The Shaoshui canalization project from Shaoyang City to the Liangshitang dam section of Shaodong County has greatly developed irrigation, shipping, industry, and power generation since its completion in December last year. Through this river, coking coal from the Niumasi and Liangshitang coal mines is transported to various steel bases, and transportation efficiency has increased 25 times compared to before. It can be navigated year-round and enables 60,000 mu of farmland on both sides of the river to completely avoid the threat of drought. At the same time, eight hydroelectric power stations were built, with a power generation capacity of 3,100 kilowatts. Maojun Commune in LanJia County, Chenzhou Prefecture, cooperated with the county power plant to transform a water mill into a comprehensive hydraulic "omnipotent factory" capable of grinding grain, milling rice, sifting rice, processing sweet potatoes, making granular fertilizer, and grinding flour. Last year, the Shizishi Hydropower Station in Guiyang County used electricity to pump water for irrigation, which more than doubled the unit area yield of farmland. The masses enthusiastically praised: "The power of the commune is greater than the sky, mountain streams and rivers follow the people's wishes, build power stations quickly, well, and economically, and bring happiness to the people without end."
    Through this period of vigorous mass movement for comprehensive water energy utilization, the experience of comprehensive water energy utilization has been greatly enriched and developed. For example, the Xiangpu Brigade of the Meiqiao Commune in Xiangxiang County used a small stream with extremely small flow to build a flat-flow hydraulic station. In a small stream with a water depth of only one foot, they created an artificial drop and used two self-made cylindrical wooden waterwheels to simultaneously drive various agricultural and sideline product processing machines and machines for sewing, fetching water, and blowing air to carry out work. Only 18 people were used to replace the labor of 200 people, opening up a broad path for comprehensive water energy utilization.
    Currently, the broad masses of the province are making great efforts to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of this year's plan to build another 100,000 to 200,000 hydraulic stations and small hydroelectric stations with an installed capacity of 50,000 kilowatts.

    综合利用水能　加速农业技术改造
    湖南大建水力站和水电站
    本报讯　湖南省广大农村人民公社大搞水能综合利用，大建水力站、水电站的群众运动，正在蓬勃开展。据目前的不完全统计，全省已建成投入生产的水力站四万二千七百一十二处，有十四万零三百一十四马力；水电站三百七十处，装机容量达九千四百二十九瓩。等于全省每天为农业增添劳动力一百一十二万多个。人们把水力站誉为“不吃草料的千里马”，它使农村千千万万的笨重体力劳动和手工操作，用机械来代替，有力地促进了农业、畜牧业、加工业、社办工业的生产；对加速农业技术改造，有巨大和深远的意义。
    湖南省水利资源极为丰富，除湘、资、沅、澧四大河流外，还有大小支流二千八百四十二条，溪沟渠道纵横密布各地。几年来，各级党组织领导群众开发利用水利资源，取得很好的成绩。今年为了适应农业、畜牧业和农副产品的加工业大发展的需要，省委号召各地认真总结经验，进一步大搞水能综合利用，在全省范围内迅速掀起一个全民大搞水能综合利用高潮。已建成投入生产的水力站和水电站，对发展生产起了巨大的作用。例如，邵阳专区已投入生产的水力站有二万六千二百八十八处，共计约六万八千六百零四马力，可节省五十一万多个劳动力。涟源县的水洞底公社“三八”饲养场建立一处水力站后，饲养员由八十九人减少到十二人，生猪由五百多头增加到二千七百多头，如用两人操作的水力切草机和精饲料粉碎机，就代替了四十八人的手工劳动。
    在大搞水能综合利用中，各地在党的正确领导下，大搞群众运动，紧紧依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材，进行建站。因此，发展迅速，出现了一处开花处处红的新局面。湘西土家族苗族自治州在“战胜穷山恶水，变穷山为富山，叫小溪听使唤，用水力代替人力”的豪迈口号鼓舞下，充分发动群众，仅一个多月的时间，全州就建成水力站二千一百七十三处，相当于一万三千零三十八马力。
    在发展水能综合利用中，各地都注意做到了灌溉、航运、动力相结合，为农业技术改造创造了有利条件。从邵阳市到邵东县两市塘河坝段的邵水渠化工程，自去年12月建成后，就大大发展了灌溉、航运、工业和发电事业。通过这条河把牛马司、两市塘煤矿的焦煤运往各个钢铁基地，运输效率比以前提高了二十五倍，能全年通航，并使沿河两岸六万亩农田，完全避免了旱灾威胁；同时，修了八个水力发电站，发电能力达三千一百瓩。郴州专区蓝嘉县毛俊公社和县电厂合作，将一盘水磨改建为能够磨谷、碾米、筛米、加工红薯、制颗粒肥料和磨面等综合性水力万能工厂。桂阳县石子狮水电站利用电力抽水灌溉，去年使农田单位面积产量提高了一倍以上。群众热情歌颂道：公社力量大于天，山溪河水随人愿，多快好省建电站，为民造福乐无边。
    通过这段时期轰轰烈烈综合利用水能的群众运动，大大丰富和发展了综合利用水能的经验。如湘乡县梅桥公社香铺大队，利用流量极小的平水小溪流，建成了平流水力站，他们在水深不过一尺的小溪里，经过人造落差，用自制的两部筒车式的木质水轮，可以同时带动各种农副产品加工机具和缝纫、汲水、鼓风等机具进行工作，只用十八个人就可代替二百人的劳动，为综合利用水能开拓了宽广的途径。
    目前，全省广大群众正鼓足干劲，为保证提前超额完成今年再建十万到二十万处水力站和装机容量达五万瓩的小型水电站建站计划而努力。
