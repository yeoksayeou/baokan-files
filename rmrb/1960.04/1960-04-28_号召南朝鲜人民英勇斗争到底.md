Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th: According to the Korean Central News Agency: Leaders of political parties and social organizations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a joint meeting in Pyongyang today to discuss the current situation in South Korea.

The meeting was attended by Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, Chung Il-ryong, Nam Il and other leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, and leaders of various political parties and social organizations.

Also attending the meeting were representatives of culture, art, working people and students of Pyongyang.

Park Kim-chul, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, made a report at the meeting. He said that in order to deal with the current chaotic and urgent situation in South Korea and to meet the demands of the people, the US aggressive forces must first withdraw from South Korea immediately and completely abolish the traitorous rule of Syngman Rhee.

In his report, Park Kim-chul praised the mass struggle of the South Korean people over the past few dozen days, like a prairie fire, against the fascist terror rule of the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. He said that no force could stop the South Korean people's struggle for a new politics, a new life and a new leadership.

Park Kim-chul said that US imperialism was alarmed by the fundamental shaking of its colonial rule and the total collapse of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. In order to confuse world opinion on the situation in South Korea and to deceive the South Korean people, it was playing various tricks in an attempt to shirk responsibility, continue to occupy South Korea and maintain its colonial rule in South Korea. He said that the Syngman Rhee clique was following the US conspiracy, attempting to paralyze the South Korean people's fighting spirit with remedial measures such as a puppet bureaucratic transitional regime and a transition to a "cabinet responsibility system". On the other hand, US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique were also suppressing, massacring and threatening the people.

Park Kim-chul emphasized that the US imperialists must be held responsible for the crimes they have committed in South Korea. The US troops must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible and must not interfere in the Korean people's solution of their own problems. He also said that the Syngman Rhee's ruling apparatus must be completely abolished from top to bottom, and Syngman Rhee must be arrested immediately and handed over to the people for trial.

He said that in order to abolish the puppet ruling apparatus, a temporary administrative organization composed of representatives of workers, peasants and people from all walks of life should be established to temporarily exercise the power of the South Korean government.

He emphasized that in order to deal with the current situation in South Korea and open up the current situation in the motherland, a joint conference of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea must be held as soon as possible to formulate a policy for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to peacefully reunify the motherland by the Korean people themselves as soon as possible.

Subsequently, Hong Myung-hee, representative of the Democratic Independence Party, Park Jung-ae, representative of the Democratic Women's Alliance, Lee Hyo-soon, representative of the General Federation of Trade Unions, Kang Ryang-wook, representative of the North Korean Democratic Party, and Park Shin-duk, representative of the Chondoist Chongu Party, spoke at the meeting. Finally, the meeting adopted a statement on the South Korean situation issued in the name of various political parties and social organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th: According to the Korean Central News Agency: Leaders of political parties and social organizations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a joint meeting today to discuss the current situation in South Korea and issued a statement. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Now is the most urgent and serious moment to decide the future of our motherland and the destiny of the nation.

In South Korea, the mass popular resistance struggle to abolish the fascist terror rule of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique has been going on for dozens of days.

The heroic resistance struggle of the South Korean people, regardless of the barbaric bloody armed suppression of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, is expanding and rising every moment like a prairie fire.

All good people in Korea are supporting and supporting the struggle of the South Korean people, and the eyes of the world are focused on the development of the situation in South Korea.

We, the representatives of political parties and social organizations, have gathered together to discuss measures to deal with the current situation in South Korea.

Now, in order to shirk responsibility for the current situation in South Korea, the US imperialists are playing various deceptive tricks while threatening the South Korean people and instructing the Syngman Rhee clique to suppress the people.

The US imperialists are trying to deceive the people by having its loyal lackeys take expedient measures such as reorganizing the structure of the puppet government, "amending the constitution", implementing a "cabinet responsibility system", and then dissolving the "National Assembly" and re-"electing".

The so-called transitional government is nothing but a continuation and replica of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. Even if a "cabinet responsibility system" is implemented, it will not change the essence of the traitorous regime in the slightest.

In particular, the reactionary "election" system and the puppet ruling apparatus that organizes and implements the "election" remain intact, and any "election" will not realize the will of the people. The "separate election" in South Korea under the supervision of the so-called "United Nations" can only permanently divide our motherland as in the past, and can only bring hunger, poverty and slavery to the South Korean people. Haven't all the "separate elections" in South Korea so far proved this?

The South Korean people's bloody struggle is by no means for the continuation of the puppet regime under the slavery of US imperialism.

At this serious moment in our nation's history, which is pregnant with new changes, what is the way to deal with the situation and overcome the current situation?

That is, first of all, to make the US imperialists withdraw immediately, because it is they who have turned South Korea into a land of unprecedented hunger, poverty and darkness as it is today.

It is the US imperialists who are the masterminds behind dividing our motherland, creating the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, establishing a fascist terror rule system, and turning South Korea into a hell on earth as it is today. If the US imperialists do not withdraw, the colonial terror rule system cannot be eliminated, nor can the South Korean people be freed from poverty and slavery.

We solemnly declare on behalf of the voices of 30 million compatriots: the US imperialists must get out of South Korea as soon as possible. They have no basis to continue to stay in South Korea.

Let all patriotic forces of our nation unite and launch a struggle to make the US imperialist aggressive forces withdraw immediately!

No interference by US imperialism in Korean internal affairs can be allowed.

The US imperialist aggressive forces must be withdrawn and the Syngman Rhee fascist rule system must be completely eliminated. Arrest the traitor Syngman Rhee immediately and hand him over to the people for trial.

The Syngman Rhee puppet ruling institutions such as the "State Council" and the "National Assembly" in South Korea must be dissolved immediately, and the bully bureaucrats who colluded with the Syngman Rhee clique must be driven out of the power organs.

We propose that in order to deal with the current situation, a temporary administrative organization composed of representatives of workers, peasants, youth students, scientists, cultural figures, soldiers, entrepreneurs and businessmen must be established immediately. This administrative organization must temporarily exercise power in South Korea.

The South Korean police, the tool for suppressing and massacring the people, must be dissolved immediately, and a people's police must be organized to maintain law and order.

Only such an organization composed of representatives of the people who participated in the struggle can make the solution of the problem conform to the will of the people.

All the evil laws made by the Syngman Rhee clique for the purpose of cruelly suppressing and massacring the people, including the "Political Party Registration Law" and the "New National Security Law," must be abolished immediately.

Also, all traitorous unequal treaties such as the "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" and the "US-ROK Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" must be unconditionally abolished.

Only in this way can the true freedom and democratic rights of South Korea be guaranteed.

Freedom of activity for all political parties and social organizations must be guaranteed.

Today, the current situation in South Korea cannot be dealt with by the strength of any one political party or organization.

The various political parties and social organizations that were dissolved or declared illegal due to the barbaric suppression of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique must be legalized and their freedom of activity must be fully guaranteed.

Without fully legalizing the activities of all these political parties and social organizations, there can be no freedom or democracy.

Without guaranteeing the freedom of activity of political parties and social organizations, it will be impossible to eliminate the consequences of the Syngman Rhee clique's malicious fascist rule, and it will never be possible to deal with the current serious situation.

Complete freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association and demonstration, and true democratic rights must be guaranteed.

Martial law must be lifted immediately and the illegally imprisoned demonstrators and political prisoners must be released unconditionally.

The masterminds and executioners who barbarously massacred the demonstrators must be arrested and severely punished immediately.

All the property of traitors such as Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong must be confiscated as funds to help the unemployed, vagrants, orphans and poor people.

Since ancient times, our nation has been a single nation living in one land.

Fifteen years of division has caused great obstacles to the unified development of politics, economy, culture and other sectors. We can no longer tolerate the division of the motherland. The tragedy of the division of the country must be eliminated as soon as possible.

We propose that, in order to end the division of the motherland and to discuss the great cause of the nation, a joint conference of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea be held as soon as possible.

Representatives from North and South Korea should gather together, first of all, to tear down the wall between North and South Korea, and to quickly realize the free movement and exchange of letters between North and South Korea.

The abnormal situation in which parents, brothers and relatives and friends cannot exchange messages must be ended immediately. Restoring the national economy in South Korea that has been destroyed and stabilizing the people's livelihood that has fallen into misery are the most urgent tasks today.

Our Republic in the north has an independent national economic base that can restore the South Korean economy and stabilize the South Korean people's livelihood.

We hope that this economic foundation can help the South Korean people stabilize their lives as soon as possible.

In order to solve this problem, a joint North-South Economic Committee consisting of representatives of North Korean economic organs and representatives of South Korean economic circles is needed.

The unemployed must be employed, famine-stricken farmers must be helped, students must be allowed to attend school for free, and the people must be given free medical care.

Only by relying on the powerful economic strength of North Korea can all this be solved.

All conscientious people who care about the freedom of the motherland and the destiny of the nation must now get rid of all prejudices and gather together. Now is not the time to investigate the differences in political parties, political views and beliefs, the presence or absence of property, and the past. All forces should be used to deal with the current situation, implement the general election in North and South Korea, and establish a unified government. Only by holding a general election and establishing a unified government based on the general will of the people in North and South Korea without any foreign interference can the true freedom, democracy and independence of the South Korean people be guaranteed.

All those who cherish the future of the motherland and the destiny of the nation should join hands and participate bravely in the ranks of the sacred struggle to save the country with one heart and one mind.

For the immediate withdrawal of the US imperialists, for the comprehensive abolition of the Syngman Rhee fascist terror rule institutions, for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, everyone should unite under the banner of the anti-US struggle to save the country!

Let the South Korean people ignite the flames of struggle against US imperialism and Syngman Rhee's terror rule even higher!

Officers and soldiers of the South Korean "National Army" and the police must not point their guns at the heroic struggling compatriots, and should resolutely reject anti-people actions, reject the orders of the Syngman Rhee clique that is heading for destruction, and come to the side of the people! Do not be slaves to any bureaucrats, but become people's troops protecting the interests of the people; do not be puppet troops commanded by the American devils, but be national troops defending national independence. Do not commit sins that will never be washed away for thousands of generations, but join the ranks of the people's resistance struggle.

Those who implement the "expedient measures" of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique to deceive the people will inevitably suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

Fifteen years of darkness has been broken through, and dawn is coming to South Korea. No force can stop the solemn advance of the South Korean people's struggle, and advance overcoming all difficulties!

Long live the unified and united Korean people!

    朝鲜各政党团体发表联合声明
    号召南朝鲜人民英勇斗争到底
    要求美帝国主义从南朝鲜立即滚出去，立即逮捕卖国贼李承晚并交给人民审判，立即由工人、农民、青年、学生等代表组成临时行政机构在南朝鲜行使政权；早日召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体的联席会议；根据南北朝鲜人民的意志实行总选举，建立统一政府，保证南朝鲜人民真正的自由、民主和独立。
    新华社平壤27日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、社会团体的领导人今天在平壤举行联席会议，讨论目前南朝鲜的局势。
    参加会议的有：金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日等朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导人，和各政党社会团体的领导人。
    参加会议的还有文化、艺术界人士、平壤市劳动人民和学生的代表。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆在会上作了报告。他说，要收拾南朝鲜目前混乱而紧迫的局势、满足人民的要求，首先要使美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤走，完全废除李承晚卖国统治。
    朴金喆在报告中赞扬了南朝鲜人民几十天来展开的反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团法西斯恐怖统治的燎原烈火般的群众斗争。他说，任何力量也阻挡不住南朝鲜人民为要求新政治、新生活、新领导而进行的这种斗争。
    朴金喆说，美帝国主义对它的殖民统治从根本上动摇和李承晚傀儡政府总崩溃的局面感到惊慌，它为了混淆全世界对南朝鲜局势的舆论、为了欺骗南朝鲜人民，玩弄着各种手法，企图推卸责任，继续强占南朝鲜并维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。他说，李承晚集团追随美国的阴谋，企图以傀儡官僚组织过渡政权，过渡到“内阁责任制”等弥补措施，来麻痹南朝鲜人民的斗争情绪。另一方面，美帝国主义和李承晚集团还在镇压、屠杀和威胁人民。
    朴金喆强调指出，美帝国主义者必须对它在南朝鲜犯下的罪过负责。美国军队必须早日从南朝鲜撤走，不能对朝鲜人民解决自己的问题进行干涉。他还说，必须从上层到基层彻底废除李承晚的统治机构，立即把李承晚逮捕起来，交给人民审判。
    他说，为了废除傀儡统治机构，要成立由工人、农民等各界人民代表组成的临时行政机构，临时行使南朝鲜的政权。
    他强调说，为了收拾南朝鲜的目前局势，和打开祖国目前的局面，必须早日召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体的联席会议，共聚一堂，制订和平统一祖国的方针，早日由朝鲜人民自己和平统一祖国。
    接着，民主独立党代表洪命熹、民主妇女同盟代表朴正爱、职业总同盟代表李孝淳、北朝鲜民主党代表康良煜、天道教青友党代表朴信德等在会上发了言。最后，会议通过了以各政党、社会团体的名义发表的关于南朝鲜局势的声明。
    新华社平壤27日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、社会团体的领导人今天举行联席会议讨论了南朝鲜目前局势，并发表了声明。声明全文如下：
    现在正是决定我们祖国的将来和民族命运的最迫切的严肃的时刻。
    在南朝鲜，为了废除美帝国主义和李承晚集团的法西斯恐怖统治所进行的群众性的人民反抗斗争，已经继续进行了几十天了。
    南朝鲜人民的英雄的反抗斗争，不顾美帝国主义和李承晚集团的野蛮的血腥的武装镇压像燎原烈火一样每时每刻都在扩大，更加高涨。
    全朝鲜善良的人们都在支持和声援南朝鲜人民的斗争，全世界的视线都注视着南朝鲜局势的发展。
    我们政党、社会团体代表，为了讨论收拾南朝鲜目前局势的措施，聚集在一堂。
    现在，美帝国主义者为了推卸对南朝鲜目前局势的责任，一面玩弄各种骗人的手法；一面又威胁南朝鲜人民，并指示李承晚集团镇压人民。
    美帝国主义者企图使它的忠实走狗采取改组傀儡政府的机构、“修改宪法”、实行“内阁责任制”，然后解散“国会”，重新“选举”等等权宜之计来欺骗人民。
    所谓过渡政府，只不过是李承晚傀儡政府的继续和它的翻版。即使实行“内阁责任制”，也丝毫不能改变卖国政权的本质。
    尤其是，反动的“选举”制度和组织执行“选举”的傀儡统治机构都原封不动，进行任何“选举”也不会实现人民的意志。在所谓“联合国”监督下的南朝鲜的“单独选举”，只能和过去一样地永久分裂我们祖国，只能给南朝鲜人民带来饥饿、贫穷和奴役。到现在为止的南朝鲜的一切“单独选举”，不都证实了这一点吗？
    南朝鲜人民的浴血斗争，决不是为了使在美帝国主义奴役下的傀儡政权继续下去。
    在我们民族的历史中孕育着新的变革的这一严肃的时刻，收拾局势、克服目前局面的途径是什么呢？
    那就是，首先要使美帝国主义者立即撤走，是它把南朝鲜变成了今天这样的史无前例的饥饿、贫穷以及黑暗的土地。
    分裂我们的祖国，制造李承晚傀儡政权，建立法西斯恐怖统治制度，并使南朝鲜变成今天这样人间地狱的主谋者正是美帝国主义者。美帝国主义者不撤走，就不能消除殖民地恐怖统治制度，也不能使南朝鲜人民摆脱贫穷和奴役。
    我们代表三千万同胞的呼声严正地宣告：美帝国主义者必须早日从南朝鲜滚出去。他们没有任何根据继续赖在南朝鲜。
    我们民族的一切爱国力量团结起来，为使美帝国主义侵略军队立即撤走展开斗争吧！
    决不能容许美帝国主义对朝鲜内政的任何干涉。
    必须使美帝国主义侵略军队撤走，彻底消除李承晚法西斯统治制度。立即逮捕卖国贼李承晚，交给人民审判。
    必须立即解散南朝鲜的“国务院”和“国会”等李承晚傀儡统治机构，并从政权机关中赶走同李承晚集团勾结的恶霸官僚。
    我们主张：为了收拾目前局势，必须立即成立由工人、农民、青年学生、科学文化人士、士兵、企业家、商人代表组成的临时行政机构。必须使这个行政机构在南朝鲜临时行使政权。
    必须立即解散镇压和屠杀人民的工具——南朝鲜警察，组织人民警察维持治安。
    只有以参加斗争的人民的代表组成的这种机构，才能使问题的解决合乎人民的意志。
    必须立即废除包括“政党登记法”、“新国家保安法”在内的、以残酷镇压和屠杀人民为目的的李承晚集团制造的一切恶法。
    还要无条件地废除“韩美共同防御条约”、“韩美友好通商航海条约”等一切卖国的不平等条约。
    只有这样，才能保障南朝鲜的真正的自由和民主权利。
    必须保障一切政党和社会团体的自由活动。
    今天，以任何一个政党或团体的力量，是不能收拾南朝鲜目前局势的。
    必须使由于美帝国主义和李承晚集团野蛮镇压而被解散或被宣布非法的各政党、社会团体合法化，并完全保证其活动的自由。
    不使这一切政党、社会团体的活动完全合法化，就谈不上任何自由和民主。
    不保证各政党、社会团体活动的自由，就无法消除李承晚集团的恶毒的法西斯统治的后果，也决不能收拾目前的严重局势。
    必须保证言论、出版、集会、结社、示威的完全自由和真正的民主权利。
    必须立即取消戒严令，并无条件释放被非法囚禁的示威者和政治犯。
    必须立即逮捕和严厉处罚野蛮屠杀示威者的主谋者和刽子手。
    必须没收李承晚和李起鹏等卖国贼的全部财产作为救济失业者、流浪者、孤儿和穷人的资金。
    我们民族自古以来就是生活在一个国土上的单一民族。
    持续了十五年的分裂，给政治、经济、文化等各部门的统一发展造成了莫大的障碍。我们再也不能忍受祖国的分裂了。必须早日消除国土两分的悲剧。
    我们建议，为了结束祖国的分裂，为了协商民族的大业，早日召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体的联席会议。
    南北朝鲜的代表共聚一堂，首先推倒横拦在南北朝鲜之间的墙壁，必须迅速实现南北朝鲜的自由来往和互通书信。
    必须立即结束父母兄弟和亲戚朋友不能互通消息的不正常的状态。恢复南朝鲜被破坏的民族经济，安定陷入涂炭的人民生活，是今天最迫切的事情。
    我们共和国北部有着能够恢复南朝鲜经济，能够安定南朝鲜人民生活的独立的民族经济基础。
    我们希望这个经济基础能早日帮助南朝鲜人民安定生活。
    为了解决这个问题，需要由北朝鲜经济机关代表和南朝鲜经济界代表组成南北联合经济委员会。
    必须使失业者就业，救济断粮农民，使学生免费上学，使人民得到免费医疗。
    只有依靠北朝鲜的强大的经济力量，才能解决这一切。
    关怀祖国的自由和民族的命运的一切有良心的人士们现在要摆脱各种偏见聚集在一堂。现在不是追究属何政党、政见和信仰的不同、财产的有无、过去如何等等的时候。应把一切力量用于收拾目前的局势、实行南北朝鲜的总选举、建立统一政府。只有在没有任何外国干涉的情况下，根据南北朝鲜人民的总的意志，实行总选举，建立统一的政府，才能保证南朝鲜人民的真正的自由、民主和独立。
    珍视祖国的将来和民族的命运的所有的人们都应当携起手来，一心一德地勇敢地参加神圣的救国斗争的队列。
    为了使美帝国主义者立即撤走，为了全面废除李承晚法西斯恐怖统治机构，为了祖国的和平统一，大家都在反美救国斗争的旗帜下团结起来！
    南朝鲜人民更高地燃起反对美帝国主义和李承晚恐怖统治的斗争的火焰吧！
    南朝鲜“国军”官兵们和警察们不要把枪口对着进行英雄斗争的同胞们，应该坚决拒绝反人民的行动，拒绝执行走向灭亡的李承晚集团的命令，到人民这边来吧！不要作任何官僚的奴仆，应成为保护人民的利益的人民军队；不要干受美国鬼子指挥的傀儡军队，要作保卫民族独立的民族的军队。不要犯下千秋万代永洗不清的罪恶，而要汇合到人民反抗斗争的队伍里来。
    执行美帝国主义和李承晚集团的欺骗人民的“权宜之计”的人将免不了要遭到同李承晚同样的命运。
    十五年来的黑暗被冲破了，黎明就要来到南朝鲜了。没有任何力量能够阻止南朝鲜人民的斗争的庄严的前进，克服一切的困难前进吧！
    统一团结的朝鲜人民万岁！
