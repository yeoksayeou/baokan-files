Push the Farm Tool Reform Movement to a New High Tide
Li Xiaohuang, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture

    The leap-forward development of agricultural production and the realization of people's communes are pushing the farm tool reform movement to a higher stage, and faster towards semi-mechanization and mechanization. In 1959 alone, Shandong Province created and reformed more than 1,500 kinds of advanced farm tools, with over 27 million pieces being promoted and used. These included semi-mechanized and mechanized tools for cultivation, transportation, water lifting, cooking, feeding, water conservancy construction, and other aspects. Advanced tools in several major areas have been matched into complete sets. The promotion and use of these farm tools saved approximately 1.1 billion workdays on the agricultural production front in one year, equivalent to an increase of more than 4 million laborers, powerfully ensuring the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. This marks that Shandong Province's agricultural technology transformation movement has entered a new stage of complete set reform from single item reform. At present, our task is to push this magnificent farm tool reform movement to a new peak, with transforming manual operation into semi-mechanization as the main direction of attack, and strive to basically realize agricultural semi-mechanization in the province within this year.

    With the mass manufacture and promotion of new-style farm tools and the vigorous development of the mass farm tool reform movement, some new contradictions have been exposed in the farm tool reform movement, which need to be further resolved. One problem is that there are many models of the same type of tool, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, requiring careful research to finalize and improve them. For example, in terms of deep plowing and close planting tools, more than 80 kinds of deep plows and more than 70 kinds of close planting drills have been created and reformed throughout the province. Which ones are the best and can be finalized for mass manufacture and promotion? This urgently requires concentrating them, experimenting and comparing them, selecting the best from the best, and finalizing and promoting them according to local conditions. Further improvement and upgrading can be sought through promotion and use. Second, the reform and creation and development of various farm tools are unbalanced. Some farm tools have been reformed a lot, while others are lacking. This affects the further improvement of agricultural production and the comprehensive implementation of agricultural technical measures. Especially after the realization of people's communes, great changes have taken place in the farming system, and large-scale high-yield fields have been generally established, which urgently requires a rapid change in this unbalanced situation of technical level of each process, so as to achieve a new balance on the basis of improving the technical level. Therefore, constantly promoting the movement to a higher stage, so that farm tool reform and agricultural production can adapt to each other and promote each other, has become a very important issue in the current farm tool reform.

    In order to further promote the farm tool reform movement, a mass farm tool census, evaluation, appraisal, and promotion work was carried out from bottom to top throughout the province not long ago. Although this work has not been carried out deeply enough in some areas, and the development between regions is not balanced enough, it has achieved remarkable results.

    First, a large number of advanced farm tools that can be finalized and promoted have been selected in various places. More than 950 pieces of various advanced farm tools were selected and sent from various places, and finally, after evaluation and appraisal, 178 pieces can be immediately promoted and used throughout the province. The comprehensive promotion and use of these new tools will make the basic processes of deep plowing, fine harrowing, ridging, sowing, fertilizing, watering, cultivating, harvesting, transportation, threshing, processing, and feeding in terms of cultivation, pulverizing, steaming, cooking, feeding, water supply, and manure removal, as well as water conservancy construction, cooking, and other aspects, mainly semi-mechanized tools, supplemented by some improved farm tools, reaching "complete set". These various new tools gathered together fully demonstrate the great achievements of Shandong Province's tool reform in the past two years, and further encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses for tool reform. For example, through the census and evaluation work, Tancheng County not only selected 102 kinds of advanced farm tools, but also identified weak links and deficiencies, studied measures to fill the gaps, and immediately sent people to other regions to learn and imitate. After the farm tool census and evaluation, the broad masses saw a large number of advanced farm tools emerging endlessly, and happily composed 快板 (clapper talk) to praise the achievements of farm tool reform: "People's communes are really good, industry and agriculture leap forward together, innovation blossoms everywhere, bulky tools are transformed; close planting drills and deep plows, farming is meticulous, fast, good and economical; water mills and power mills, turn themselves without people pushing; thousands of good things, thanks to the Party's good leadership."

    Second, the types and quantities of existing farm tools and the needs of the masses have been clarified, thereby promoting the formulation of farm tool addition and reform plans by production teams, production plans by industrial departments, and purchase and sales plans by commercial departments, so that industry, agriculture, and commerce are closely combined. For example, through the census, Liaocheng City found that there were more than 1.16 million pieces of farm tools, of which more than 90,000 pieces needed to be repaired, and more than 120,000 pieces of farm tools were still lacking. They immediately organized a professional repair army of more than 3,000 people and a technical team of 1,500 people to create and rush to manufacture new farm tools. After more than 20 days of hard work, all the farm tools that needed to be repaired were generally repaired, and 24 kinds of new tools were created, and more than 2,600 pieces were manufactured.

    Third, it has promoted the further development and growth of commune industry and the farm tool repair and distribution network. For example, in the census, Pingyin County found that the number of farm tools lacking and damaged was very large, and the repair and distribution tasks were heavy. It then rectified and established 49 farm tool repair and distribution stations and 284 farm tool repair and distribution groups, and supplemented and equipped 1,224 workers, reaching an average of one repair and distribution station or repair and distribution group for every one and a half production brigades, forming a complete farm tool manufacturing and repair and distribution network. It has laid a favorable material foundation for the further development of the farm tool reform movement.

    In addition, through the development of farm tool census, evaluation, appraisal, and promotion work in various places, a number of advanced units and innovation experts have also been commended and rewarded, red flags have been inserted, and models have been established, further strengthening the red and expert ranks of the farm tool reform.

    With the development of farm tool census, evaluation, appraisal, and promotion work in various places, we have become more and more deeply aware that doing this work practically is not only an effective method to systematically summarize the experience of the province's farm tool reform movement, improve understanding, clarify the direction, and further mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses for tool reform, and promote the better development of the movement; it also creates favorable conditions for the province to vigorously engage in agricultural mechanization. This practice is also a concrete implementation of Chairman Mao's often taught mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses, concentrate, and persevere."

    Through the province-wide farm tool census and evaluation, the farm tool reform movement has the following major effects: First, it can clarify the farm tool foundation, formulate a farm tool reform plan that adapts to the leap forward situation, and make the manufacturing, promotion, and reform work have a clear understanding and a focused goal. Second, the census, evaluation, and appraisal are important methods for discovering, concentrating, and promoting the wisdom of the masses, and also a concrete manifestation of trusting the masses and taking the mass line. At the same time, it is also an important step to make the farm tool reform leap forward, so that the farm tool reform takes the first step and walks ahead of production. Third, this is a good method to make the farm tool reform work fast, good, and economical. After the census, evaluation, and appraisal, selecting the best from the best will reduce the groping process of reform and find the shortcut to reform.

    Therefore, it can be said that the guided and mass farm tool evaluation, appraisal, and finalization and promotion work is a very important and crucial measure to promote the further in-depth and widespread development of the farm tool reform movement.

    把农具改革运动推向新高峰
    山东省农业厅副厅长　李晓黄
    农业生产的飞跃发展和人民公社化的实现，推动着农具改革运动向更高的阶段发展，更快地走向半机械化和机械化。仅1959年，山东省创造、改制的各种先进农具即达一千五百多种，推广使用二千七百多万件。其中有耕作、运输、提水、炊事、饲养、水利施工等各方面的半机械化和机械化工具，在几个主要方面的先进工具已经配套成龙。这些农具的推广、使用，一年来为农业生产战线上大约节省了十一亿个工作日，等于增加了四百多万个劳动力，有力地保证了工农业生产的全面跃进。这标志着山东省农业技术改造运动，已由单项改革进入到成套改革的新阶段。当前，我们的任务就是要把这一波澜壮阔的农具改革运动推向新的高峰，以变手工操作为半机械化作为主攻方向，为力争今年内全省基本上实现农业半机械化的光荣任务而奋斗。
    随着新式农具的大量制造、推广和群众性农具改革运动的蓬勃发展，农具改革运动中就暴露出了一些新的矛盾，需要进一步解决。问题之一是同类的工具型号很多，各有长短，需要认真研究定型提高。如在深耕、密植工具方面，全省各地创造、改制的深耕犁八十多种，密植耧七十多种，到底哪些是最好的，可以定型大量制造、推广，这就迫切需要集中起来，加以试验比较，优中选优，因地制宜地加以定型推广，通过推广使用求得进一步改进提高。二是各项农具改革、创造发展不平衡，有些农具改制的很多，而有些又是缺门。这就影响着农业生产的进一步提高和农业技术措施的全面推行。特别是在实现人民公社化后，耕作制度有了很大的改革，大面积丰产方普遍建立，迫切要求迅速改变这种各工序技术水平不平衡的状况，达到在提高技术水平的基础上取得新的平衡。因此，不断地推动运动向更高的阶段发展，使农具改革和农业生产相互适应，相互促进，就成为当前农具改革中一个十分重要的问题。
    为了进一步推动农具改革运动，不久前，在全省范围内开展了一次自下而上的群众性的农具普查、评选、鉴定、推广工作。尽管这一工作部分地区进行得还不够深入，地区间发展得也不够平衡，但是，已经取得了显著成效。
    首先，各地评选出了大批可以定型、推广的先进农具。各地选送的各种先进农具达九百五十余件，最后经过评选、鉴定，有一百七十八件可以立即在全省范围内推广使用。全面地推广使用这些新工具，就使全省在耕作方面的深耕、细耙、筑畦、播种、施肥、浇水、中耕、收获、运输、脱粒、加工和饲养方面的粉碎、蒸煮、喂食、供水、除粪以及水利施工、炊事等方面的基本工序，都以半机械化工具为主，辅以部分改良农具，分别达到“配套成龙”。这些集中起来的各种各样的新工具，充分显示了山东省两年来工具改革的伟大成绩，进一步鼓舞了广大群众对工具改革的积极性和创造性。如郯城县通过普查、评选工作，全县不仅评选出了一百零二种先进农具，而且找出了薄弱环节和缺门，研究出补缺门的措施，并立即派人到外地区学习和仿制。广大群众经过农具普查、评选，看到大量先进农具层出不穷，高兴地编出快板来歌颂农具改革的成就：“人民公社真正好，工业农业齐飞跃，革新花朵遍地开，笨重工具得改造；密植耧、深耕犁，多快好省耕作细；水力磨、动力碾，不用人推自己转；千个好来万个好，多亏党的好领导。”
    第二，摸清了现有各种农具的种类、数量和群众的需要，从而推动了各生产队制定了农具增添和改革计划，工业部门制定了生产计划，商业部门制定了进销计划，使工农商三者密切结合。如聊城市通过普查，摸清了有农具一百一十六万多件，其中需要修理的有九万多件，尚缺少农具十二万多件。他们立即组织了三千多人的专业修理大军和一千五百多人的创造赶制新农具的技术队伍，经过二十余天的努力，将需要修理的农具普遍修完，并创造新工具二十四种，制造二千六百余件。
    第三，促进了公社工业和农具修配网进一步地发展壮大。如平阴县在普查中，发现农具缺少和损坏数量很大，修配任务繁重，随即整顿和建立了农具修配站四十九处，农具修配组二百八十四个，充实配备工人一千二百二十四名，达到平均每一个半生产大队即有一处修配站或修配组，形成了一个完整的农具制造修配网。给农具改革运动进一步打下了有利的物质基础。
    此外，各地通过农具普查、评选、鉴定、推广工作的开展，还表扬奖励了一批先进单位和革新能手，插红旗，树标兵，进一步壮大了农具改革的红专队伍。
    随着各地农具普查、评选、鉴定、推广工作的开展，使我们越来越深刻地感到切实作好这一工作，不仅是系统地总结全省农具改革运动的经验，提高认识，明确方向，进一步调动广大群众对工具改革的积极性和创造性，促进运动更好开展的有效方法；也为全省大搞农业机械化创造了有利条件。这种作法，也就是具体执行了毛主席经常教导我们的从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去的群众路线的工作方法。
    通过全省农具的普查、评选，对农具改革运动有这样几点重大的作用：一、可以摸清农具底子，制订适应跃进形势的农具改革规划，使制造、推广、改革工作，能作到心中有数，目标集中。二、普查、评选、鉴定是发掘、集中和发扬群众智慧的重要方法，也是相信群众，走群众路线的具体表现，同时也是使农具改革大跃进，使农具改革先行一步，走在生产前头的重要步骤。三、这是使农具改革工作能够作到多快好省的良好办法。经过普查、评选、鉴定，优中选优，就减少了改革的摸索过程，找到改革的捷路。
    因此，可以说，有领导地、群众性的农具评选、鉴定和定型推广工作，是推动农具改革运动进一步深入、普遍发展的一个十分重要的关键性的措施。
