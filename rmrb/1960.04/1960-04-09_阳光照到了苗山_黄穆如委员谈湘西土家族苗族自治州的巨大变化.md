Comrades,

I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and will implement them in my future work to complete the leap forward tasks given in the 1960 report.

The draft national economic plan for 1960 is a draft formulated for continuous leaps forward; the draft state budget for 1960 is a budget compiled to ensure the continued leap forward in economic construction. The two are interconnected and share the same goal. Both drafts summarize the achievements and experiences of the great leap forward in the past two years, 1958 and 1959, and propose the leap forward targets for 1960, requiring people of all nationalities across the country to strive to complete and overfulfill this glorious leap forward task. The report states that 1960 is an extremely important year for the Chinese people to develop the socialist construction cause. It bears a unique task, which is to fire the opening shot for the supplementary plan for the latter three years of the Second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, all levels, departments, organs, enterprises, and people's communes under the leadership of the Party should closely unite around the Party and Chairman Mao, strive to serve the completion of these two plans, and do everything possible to achieve them.

The leap forward construction undertaking in the national economic plan is comprehensive, encompassing everything. I can only report to the conference on a few matters concerning the achievements and experiences of my prefecture in the great leap forward of 1958 to 1959, based on the spirit of the draft.

Before liberation, I hated the reactionary rulers' saying: "Minority areas are mostly backward and poor." They used these terms to uglify our minority areas, thinking they were successful, but they didn't know that the historical root of our backwardness and poverty was what they gave us. After liberation, mountain construction received the care and attention of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the help and support of the Han elder brothers. The mountains are now a good place. When I inspected the work of factories in Baojing County, they sang these songs to welcome me:

	The mountain area is a good place,
	Where treasures grow in the center.
	Raw materials for sacks are collected in the mountains,
	Enough for generations to collect without end.

	Treasures grow in the middle of the mountain,
	Chinese sweetgum bark fills the mountain bay.
	Kudzu vines, bamboo shoot shells, and tung tree bark,
	Just pick them up when you go up the mountain.

	Use them to weave sacks,
	Durable, long-lasting, and beautiful.
	Factories are built on commune streets,
	The blind, deaf, mute, and lame can all work.

	The Party's leadership is really good!
	The mountain area is a paradise everywhere.

Under the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao, our Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has firmly grasped and applied the "three treasures" in recent years, especially since 1958 and 1959. The collective has leadership, labor is organized, affairs are regulated, production is planned, and life is arranged. All counties in the prefecture have utilized the superior conditions of the Wanbao Mountains to establish factories in a big way, everywhere, making every grass and tree useful, and every man and woman, old and young, useful. Take the county-run factories, commune-run factories, and street-run factories in Baojing County as an example. The county Party committee and county people's committee are very concerned about the people's production and life. During the great leap forward, they called on the people to promote the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and to muster heroic spirit to go up the mountains to collect wild plants as material raw materials for papermaking, sugar making, winemaking, pastry making... They also used kudzu root, kudzu vine, bamboo shoot shells, etc., all kinds of herbs and woody plants with fiber, to make sacks, mobilizing and supporting the masses to run factories in a big way, to create fiber in a big way, and to weave sacks in a big way. After many technological innovations and revolutions, the product quality was good, the output increased, the cost decreased, the sales area was wide, and the profit was very high. They are sold nearby in this prefecture and province, and far away to Sichuan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Guangxi. Since last year, domestic and foreign sales have increased daily, and the factory has been greatly expanded. In this way, the people of Baojing County have work to do, and there are no idle people anywhere. When I visited the nursing home, Peng Wanyi, a 73-year-old widowed man, and Aunt Xiang, a 72-year-old woman, said to me: "In the past, we relied entirely on government relief funds to survive. We sat all day without doing anything, the older we got, the more sick we became, and the more sick we became, the more burden we added to the government, but we didn't know how it would end. Since 1958, after participating in factory production appropriately, our monthly income is more than ten to twenty yuan. Except for food and pocket money, we save money in the county bank every month. We never expected that when the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, we would have such a solid backing, and our lives would get better day by day. When we think of these things, our hearts are sweet, and we have a lot of energy. The more we work, the more interested we become, and the younger we become. You came to ask me, I really don't know where to start. In short: thank the Communist Party, thank Chairman Mao!" I also interviewed Chen Xiaoqiao, a 17-year-old young girl with a disability in her hands and feet. She said: "In the past, I was often beaten and scolded by my parents for no reason. What was the beating and scolding for? I didn't know. My parents themselves may not have known. In short, the younger siblings made mistakes and took it out on me. At that time, I only knew: my parents wanted me to die soon. They wouldn't love me at all. After liberation, my savior came. As soon as I entered the factory, I entrusted my life to the factory. Soon, my studies and labor results were very good, and my skills were also greatly improved. This is the evaluation of the factory leaders. Every time I was praised and my wage income increased, I could not only support myself but also help my family. My parents' attitude towards me changed: they were very kind and praised me in every way. In 1959, I attended the advanced workers' conferences in the prefecture and province, and my parents were even happier with me. Our cold and ruthless family has been transformed into a family of spring breezes and warm sunshine. I can only thank the Party, thank Chairman Mao! But I don't blame my parents either, I only hate the oppression of the reactionary classes in the old society." How clearly this passage speaks of gratitude and resentment, and how thoroughly it explains the reasons!

The Miao Mountain area in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province used to be dark, especially during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group. There were many exorbitant taxes, many military disasters and bandit calamities, many days of hunger, and many deaths from disease. These difficult days have finally passed with the turn of the wheels of time. What follows is a sweet time. I can use the four words "bitterness gone, sweetness comes" to describe the Miao Mountain today.

I. The lives of the people in the Miao Mountain area used to be generally bitter. The so-called half-year grain of bran and vegetables, and the phenomenon of eating bran and vegetables all year round were also very common. After liberation, through land reform, the farmland occupied by landlords and the public land encroached upon by officials were first returned to the people, and the people's lives were improved. Vegetables and rice began to be separated. In 1958 and 1959, public canteens, nurseries, and nursing homes were organized in various communes, brigades, and production teams, and life was greatly improved. When I inspected the canteen of the Duli Brigade of the Liaojiaqiao Commune in Fenghuang County, I saw a few lines of poetry written on the wall, praising their canteen. Among them: "Three dishes are normal for each meal, the new stove is reformed into a dragon. The old and young are seated according to seniority, and men and women are seated separately from west to east. Eating vegetables requires the use of chopsticks, and meals must be eaten on time. The cooks are hygienic, with masks and skirts tied around their waists." This is a true depiction of the facts, with no exaggeration. I saw the members of the commune and their families eating in this neat and clean canteen, eating well, eating their fill, eating cleanly, and eating comfortably. How happy they are!

II. There was no education in the Miao Mountain area in the past, and the Miao people had few opportunities to receive education. After liberation, the brilliance of the ethnic policy shone on the Miao Mountain. Education opened its doors to the children of workers and peasants, and the Miao children had many opportunities to study anytime, anywhere. There are currently 1,643 public primary schools, 65 public ordinary middle schools, one Jishou University, and one public industrial, agricultural, and health secondary specialized school each in the prefecture. In addition, every commune has a complete primary school, every team has a junior primary school, and some have established junior high schools, senior high schools, spare-time schools, and red and expert universities. The number of students of various nationalities in secondary schools has increased from 4,831 in 1957 to 11,103, and the number of students of various nationalities in primary schools has increased from 92,867 in 1957 to 125,926. It can be seen that education in our prefecture is advancing with giant strides. The 1960 development education plan strives to ensure that there are schools everywhere and everyone has books to read.

The national economic plan for 1960 is a leap forward plan, a plan formulated at the request of the people, and a plan that is sure to be realized. This is because it was put forward after the Party Central Committee and the government had fully estimated the objective possibilities. Moreover, the favorable conditions this year are better than in any previous year. With the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the close unity of the people of all nationalities across the country, the leap forward experience of 1958 to 1959, and the help and support of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, these conditions are the fundamental guarantee for our country to win the great leap forward in 1960.

At present, the movement is progressing tirelessly and tensely, wave after wave, climax after climax. As long as we strengthen the Party's specific leadership over the masses, make full use of the advanced organization of the people's communes, look far ahead, grasp early, and persist in continuous revolution, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward victory can definitely be achieved, and I firmly believe that it can be achieved.

Finally, I wish the conference a smooth success and all members good health!

    阳光照到了苗山
    黄穆如委员谈湘西土家族苗族自治州的巨大变化各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，并在今后工作上贯彻执行，完成1960年报告中所给予的跃进任务。
    1960年的国民经济计划草案，是为连续跃进而制定的草案；1960年的国家预算草案是为保证经济建设持续跃进而编定的预算草案，二者相因相承，目标一致。这两个草案都总结出1958年至1959年两年来的跃进成绩同经验，提出1960年的跃进指标，要求全国各族人民争取完成和超额完成这一光荣的跃进任务。报告中说，1960年是我国人民发展社会主义建设事业极其重要的一年。它担负着独特的任务，就是要为第二个五年计划中后三年的补充计划打响开门红的第一炮。因此，凡是党领导下的各阶层、各部门、各机关、各企业、各人民公社，都应紧密团结在党和毛主席的周围，为完成这两个计划而努力服务，并以全力促其实现。
    国民经济计划中的跃进建设事业是全面的，它无所不包。我只能根据草案的精神，结合我州在1958年至1959年大跃进中所取得的成绩、经验的二三事向大会汇报。
    解放前我讨厌反动统治者的说法：“少数民族地区多是落后的、穷苦的。”他们用这些名词来丑化我们少数民族地区，自以为得意，殊不知我们落后、穷苦的历史根源，就是他们给予我们的。解放后，山区建设得到党和毛主席的关怀与照顾，汉族老大哥的帮助与支援，山区已是一个好地方了。我到保靖县视察工厂工作情况时，他们向我唱这样几首歌儿来欢迎我：
    山区是个好地方，　　万宝生在山中央。
    麻袋原料山中采，　　子孙万代采不光。
    万宝生在山中间，　　化香树皮满山湾。
    葛藤笋壳梧桐皮，　　只要上山信手搬。
    利用它们织麻袋，　　经久耐用又美观。
    公社街道建工厂，　　瞎聋哑跛都能干。
    党的领导真正好！　　山区处处是乐园。
    我们湘西土家族苗族自治州在党和毛主席的领导、关怀下，几年来，尤其是1958至1959年来，大家牢牢地掌握三宝，运用三宝。集体有领导，劳动有组织，办事有规章，生产有计划，生活有安排。全州各县利用万宝山的优越条件，大大办工厂，处处办工厂，使得一草一木皆成有用之物，男女老少皆成有用之人。就拿我州保靖县的县办工厂、社办工厂、街道办工厂来说，县委、县人委非常关心人民的生产、生活，在大跃进运动中，号召人民发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，鼓足冲天的英雄干劲，上山采掘野生植物，作为造纸、造糖、酿酒、制糕点……的物质原料。又用葛根、葛藤、笋壳叶等等，凡是带有纤维的草木植物来制造麻袋，发动和支持群众大办工厂，大造纤维，大织麻袋。通过多次技术革新革命后，产品质量良好、产量增多、成本降低、推销地广、获利甚厚。近销本州、本省，远销川鄂黔桂。从去年来，内外供销日增，工厂大为扩建。这样，使得保靖县人民个个有工做，处处无闲人。我参观敬老院时，有七十三岁的孤寡老人彭万益和七十二岁的老太太向伯娘对我说：“我们过去全靠政府的救济金养活，一天坐着一点事儿没有做，越坐越老，越老越多病，越多病越增加政府的包袱，但是我们还不知道如何结局。从1958年适当参加工厂生产后，我们每月收入工资有十多元到二十元，除去伙食、零用费外，月月有存蓄放在县银行里。万料不到共产党、毛主席来了，我们得到这样稳固的靠山，生活一天比一天好。一想到这些，我们心里是甜蜜蜜的，劲头是一股一股的，生产越干越有兴头，人越干越年青。你来问我，真不知要从那里说起。总的一句：感谢共产党、感谢毛主席！”我还访问一位先进人物十七岁的手足半残废的青年姑娘陈小巧。她说：“我过去常常无缘无故遭受父母没头没脑的打、骂。打骂后究竟是为了什么？我不知道。父母自己也未必知道。总之，弟妹犯过拿我出气我当时只知道：父母希望我快死。他们是一点不会爱我的。解放后，我的救星来了。我一进工厂，就把我的生命寄托在工厂里。不久，我的学习、劳动成绩都很好，技术也很有提高。这是工厂领导人的评语。我每次得到表扬，工资收入增加，自给之外还可以接济家用。父母对我的态度改变了：十分亲爱，百般表扬。1959年我到州里、省里参加过先进工作者会议，父母更加欢喜我了。我们冷酷无情的家庭，一变而为春风和煦的家庭。我只有感谢党、感谢毛主席！但是我也不埋怨我的父母，只憎恨旧社会反动阶级的压迫。”这一段话多么说得恩怨分明，情理透彻！
    湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州的苗山地区，过去是黑暗的，尤其在蒋介石反动集团统治时代，苛捐杂税多，兵灾匪祸多，挨饿日子多，疾病死亡多。这些难过的日子，总算随时代的车轮转过去了。跟着来的是甜蜜的岁月。我可以用“苦去甜来”这四个字，为今日的苗山写照。
    一、苗山地区人民过去一般的生活是苦的，所谓糠菜半年粮，全年吃糠菜的现象也很普遍。解放后，经过土地改革，首先把地主占有的民田和官吏侵没的公田归还人民，人民生活得到改善，菜饭开始分家。1958、1959年，各个公社、大队、生产队，都组织了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院，生活更有大的改善。我视察凤凰县廖家桥公社的都力大队食堂时见墙上写有这样几句诗，歌颂他们的食堂。内有：“每餐正常三样菜，新灶改革一条龙。老少入席分上下，男女定座别西东。挟菜规定双箸食，进餐必须按时钟。炊事社员卫生好，口罩腰裙锦束胸”。这是事实的写真，半分没有夸大。我看社员和他们老小同在这个整齐、清洁的食堂里进餐，吃得好、吃得饱，吃得干净，吃得舒畅，他们是多么的幸福啊！
    二、苗山过去没有教育，苗族人民少有受教育的机会。解放后，民族政策的光辉照到了苗山，教育为工农子弟开了门，苗族子弟就学的机会随时随地都多得很。全州现有公办小学一千六百四十三所，公办普通中学六十五所，吉首大学一所，公办工业、农业、卫生中等专业学校各一所。此外社社有完小，队队有初小，有的办了初中、高中、业余学校、红专大学。中等学校里的各民族学生由1957年的四千八百三十一人，增加到一万一千一百零三人，小学校的各民族学生由1957年的九万二千八百六十七人增加到十二万五千九百二十六人，可以看出我州教育正以巨人般的步伐向前迈进。1960年的发展教育规划，力争做到处处有学校，人人有书读。
    1960年的国民经济计划是跃进计划，是人民要求制定的计划，是决定能实现的计划。因为它经过党中央和政府的充分估计了客观的可能性以后才提出的。况且今年的有利条件比过去任何一年都要好。有党和毛主席的正确领导，有全国各民族人民的亲密团结，有1958至1959年的跃进经验，有苏联和各社会主义兄弟国家的帮助与支援，这些条件就是我国1960年夺取大跃进的根本保证。
    目前运动正在不停息地紧张地前进着，一浪高过一浪，一个高潮接着一个高潮，只要加强党对群众的具体领导，充分利用人民公社的先进组织，看得远，抓得早，坚持不断的革命，更大更好更全面的跃进胜利绝对可以实现的，而且我深信其能够实现。
    最后祝大会顺利成功，各委员身体健康！
