Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, distinguished guests and friends,

    First of all, I must thank you for gracing this grand occasion. On behalf of the government and people of Nepal, and in my own name, I extend to you the warmest welcome.

    Although you are an old friend of Nepal, I am particularly honored to welcome you here tonight, as this is your first visit as the chief guest of Nepal's first democratically elected government. Therefore, I feel that this gathering has historical significance.

    As Your Excellency knows, the basic characteristic of Nepal's foreign policy is neutrality, non-participation in any bloc of nations, and friendship with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit. Therefore, despite the differences in our political systems, we both seek universal peace, friendship, and cooperation. Both our countries advocate peace and understanding between nations, because for both of us, who are striving to build and develop our countries in our own ways, the urgent need is peace. Only in an environment of international harmony can our ideals of seeking happiness and welfare for our people be realized.

    The shocking development of nuclear weapons has made war a luxury that no country can afford. Besides world peace, there is only the path to world destruction. Recognizing this terrible reality, efforts are being made around the world to seek international trust and understanding, in order to forever banish the specter of destruction that threatens the world. The summit meeting scheduled to be held this year is a good omen, emphasizing that everyone recognizes the need to ease international tensions, thereby leading the world to an era of peace and prosperity. Our government believes that this action is a step in the right direction. We hope that the summit meeting will be successful and will open a new chapter in world history.

    Indeed, the friendship between Nepal and China can be traced back to prehistoric times, but unless this long-standing friendship is constantly strengthened through mutual visits, increased friendly contacts at all levels, and mutual cooperation and assistance in all activities, it is meaningless to merely exist or recall this friendship. To make unremitting efforts, not only to talk about the lofty principles of peaceful coexistence in theory but also to practice them in reality; to cultivate the spirit of Bandung with greater enthusiasm and zeal; and to make sincere efforts in a spirit of goodwill and mutual respect to resolve all outstanding issues—all these will inject new meaning and content into this long-standing friendship.

    I am very pleased to tell you that since Nepal and China restored diplomatic relations in 1955, the friendship between our two countries has been developing and strengthening along the lines mentioned above. I can particularly mention the unconstrained, frank, and friendly discussions I had with you in Beijing during my recent visit to your great country, and the agreements we concluded after the talks. I believe that Your Excellency will agree with me when I say that all this is not only of great benefit to our two countries, but also of great benefit to the cause of Asian unity and world peace.

    The government and people of Nepal are currently earnestly engaged in the task of building a new Nepal. In fact, we are in a period of transition, and the old feudal characteristics of society are being swept away to give way to a new democratic society. Therefore, we are very grateful for the economic assistance you have promised to provide us, especially for the friendly spirit that led you to take this generous action. I hope that in the days to come, our cooperation will continue to expand both in quantity and in kind.

    Economic development is the main factor for underdeveloped countries in Asia and other regions to survive as independent nations, and I don't need to say more about this. Therefore, there is a need for greater economic development at a faster pace. This requires creating a good atmosphere for mutual cooperation. Wherever there are outstanding issues, they should be resolved through negotiations in a mutually beneficial manner. In this regard, I cannot help but tell you that I was deeply impressed by the national construction I saw during my recent visit to your great country.

    The result of my visit to your country was the successful conclusion of an agreement to scientifically demarcate and formally mark the boundary between our two countries. I am convinced that if discussions are conducted in a friendly spirit and in an atmosphere of sincere understanding, all problems can be resolved. I hope that our meeting this time will also lead to the resolution of all issues of common concern, thereby strengthening and further developing the friendly relations between our two countries. Finally, I propose:

    For the development of friendship between Nepal and China, world peace, and the prosperity of the Chinese people,

    For the longevity and health of Your Excellency,

    For the longevity and health of our distinguished guests,

    For the longevity and health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi,

    Cheers.

### 柯伊拉腊首相讲话：希望进一步发展中尼友好关系

    柯伊拉腊首相讲话：希望进一步发展中尼友好关系周恩来总理阁下，陈毅元帅阁下，各位贵宾和朋友阁下，
    我首先必须对您光临这次盛会表示感谢，我代表尼泊尔政府和人民以及以我个人的名义向您表示最热诚的欢迎。
    虽然您是尼泊尔的老朋友，但是我为今晚能在这里欢迎您而特别感到光荣，因为这是您第一次作为尼泊尔第一届民选政府的首席贵宾来到这里，因此，我觉得这次盛会具有历史意义。
    阁下深知，尼泊尔所奉行的外交政策的基本特点是：中立，不参加任何国家集团以及在平等、相互尊重和互利的基础上同一切国家友好，因此，尽管我们两国在政治制度上有所不同，我们却一致谋求普遍和平、友谊和合作，我们两国都主张国和国之间的和平和谅解，因为对我们两个正在以各自的方式努力从事于国家的建设和发展的国家说来，迫切的需要是和平，因为只有在国际和睦的环境内，我们为人民谋求幸福和福利的理想才能实现。
    核武器的令人震惊的发展，已经使得战争成为一种任何国家都担负不起的奢侈，除了世界和平外，只有世界毁灭一途，由于认识到这一可怕的现实，全世界各地正在努力谋求国际信任和谅解，以便永远驱除威胁着全世界的毁灭的幽灵。预定在今年举行的最高级会议是一个吉兆，它着重地说明了大家都认识到必须缓和国际紧张局势，从而把世界导向和平和繁荣的时代。我国政府认为这个行动是朝着正确的方向走去的一个步骤。我们希望，最高级会议将得到成功，并将在世界史上展开新的一章。
    的确，尼泊尔同中国之间的友谊能够追溯到有史以前很久，但是，除非通过相互访问，增加各级的友好接触以及在一切活动方面的相互合作和援助来不断加强这种悠久的友谊，否则，仅仅存在或者回忆这种友谊是没有意义的。进行不懈的努力，不仅在理论上谈论而且要在实际上实行和平共处的崇高原则；以更大的热情和热心来培养万隆精神，以及，本着善意和互相尊重的精神进行真挚的努力来解决一切悬而未决的问题，所有这些都将在这种悠久的友谊中注入新的意义和内容。
    我很高兴地告诉您，自从1955年我们尼泊尔和中国这两个国家恢复外交关系以来，我们两国之间的友谊一直在按照上述方针得到发展和加强。我可以特别提到我最近访问你们伟大的国家时，在北京同您进行的无拘束的、坦率的和友好的商谈以及我们在会谈以后所缔结的协定。我相信，当我说所有这一切不但对我们两国有极大的好处，而且对亚洲团结和世界和平的事业也有极大的好处时，阁下是会同意我的看法的。
    尼泊尔的政府和人民目前正认真地从事于建设一个新尼泊尔的任务。实际上我们正处在过渡时期，社会中的旧的封建特点正在被扫除，以让位于新的民主社会。因此，我们非常感激你们答应给予我们的经济援助，特别是感激使你们采取这个慷慨行动的友好精神。我希望，在未来的日子里，我们的合作无论在数量上和种类上都将继续扩大。
    经济发展是亚洲和其他地区的不发达国家作为独立的国家生存下去的主要因素，这一点不需要我多说了。因此目前需要以更快的速度取得更大的经济发展。这就需要为相互合作创造良好的气氛。不论在那里存在着悬而未决的问题，都应该通过谈判来求得对彼此有利的解决。在这方面，我不能不告诉您，我对我在最近访问您的伟大的国家期间看到的你们国家建设的情况有深刻的印象。
    我对贵国的访问的结果是成功地缔结了一项科学地划出和正式标定我们两国之间的边界的协定。我深信，如果本着友好的精神在诚恳谅解的气氛中进行讨论的话，一切问题都是能够解决的。我希望我们这次会晤也将导致一切共同有关的问题的解决，从而加强和进一步发展我们两国之间的友好关系。最后我提议：
    为尼中两国之间的友谊的发展、世界和平和中国人民的繁荣，
    为阁下的长寿和健康，
    为我们贵宾们的长寿和健康，
    为刘少奇主席的长寿和健康，
    干杯。
