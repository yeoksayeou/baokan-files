Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 22nd. The Baoding area of Hebei province, in light of the current situation of tight planting time and increasingly severe drought, is concentrating its efforts on a crash program of dryland sowing to ensure the completion of the spring planting plan on time, with quality and quantity. At present, the entire area has seized the opportunity to plant over 1.2 million mu of field crops while the soil moisture is adequate, and has rush-irrigated 896,000 mu of dry land.

The Baoding Municipal Committee of the Communist Party and Party organizations at all levels have sent cadres to the most difficult areas for drought resistance and planting, to rush-plant alongside the masses. The Municipal Committee has drawn more than 200 cadres from various departments and sent them to the seriously drought-stricken mountainous areas, low-lying areas, and river areas. Tangxian, Zhuoxian, Laiyuan and other counties have drawn more than 900 cadres from county-level departments to the production teams and square fields with the most difficult drought resistance and planting tasks to specifically help research methods for crash planting. After a secretary of the CPC Xushui County Committee arrived at the Dawangdian Commune, he led commune and team cadres to find water in the mountains, using methods such as chiseling springs, digging canals to divert water, and "Duoxian Chuandao" (a traditional method of water diversion), so that more than 7,700 mu of dry land was irrigated in time; and organized more than 3,000 people to plant on the mountains, and has now directly planted more than 10,000 mu of sweet potatoes. Fuping County has more than 12,000 mu of dry land on mountain slopes. Under the labor and encouragement of cadres at the county, commune, and team levels, more than 15,000 commune members carried water up the mountains to plant corn and other crops on more than 2,000 mu, and the quality is very good.

In the drought resistance and planting, the communes and teams have launched collaborative support. Gaochang and other communes in the mountainous area of Tangxian County have more than 90,000 mu of land lacking water sources. Wangdu, Wangjing, and other communes in the plain area have taken the initiative to organize more than 10,000 strong laborers to go to the mountains to provide support, and brought more than 100 machines to help lift water for irrigation.

    力争按时按质按量完成春播
    保定地区抗旱播种
    新华社天津22日电　河北保定地区根据目前播种时间紧迫、旱情又日益发展的情况，正在集中力量突击旱地播种，保证按时按质按量地完成春播计划。目前全区已趁墒抢种大田作物一百二十多万亩，抢浇旱地八十九万六千多亩。
    中共保定市委和各级党组织都派出干部到抗旱抢种最困难的地方，同群众一起突击抢种。市委从各部门抽调干部二百多名，分赴干旱严重的山区、低洼地区和河套区，唐县、涿县、涞源等县从县级各部门抽调九百多名干部，到抗旱播种最困难的生产队和方田里，具体帮助研究突击播种的办法。中共徐水县委的一位书记到达大王店公社后，带动社队干部上山找水，用凿泉、开渠引水、多仙传道等办法，使七千七百多亩旱地及时得到了灌溉；并组织三千多人上山点种，现已直播甘薯一万多亩。阜平县有一万二千多亩山坡旱地，在县、社、队各级干部的劳动和鼓舞下，一万五千多名社员挑水上山点种玉米等作物二千多亩，而且质量很好。
    在抗旱播种中，社社队队展开了协作支援。唐县山区的高昌等公社有九万多亩地缺乏水源，平原的望都、王京等公社就主动组织一万多名精壮劳动力上山支援，并带来一百多台机器帮助提水浇地。
