Advancing Towards Higher Goals
Delegate Gu Jingxin Discusses the Direction of Efforts in Design Work

Presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget. We have indeed continued to achieve a great leap forward in the national economy on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958; and we have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the people of our country, a great victory for strengthening the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, and launching mass movements on a large scale. In the final analysis, it is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The 1960 national economic plan will better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, achieve a comprehensive and better leap forward in the national economy; and create conditions for continuous leaps forward in future years. We believe that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we will surely be able to overcome any difficulties, and we will surely be able to continue the Great Leap Forward faster, better, and more economically. Now I want to talk about the Great Leap Forward in our country's design work.

To build a modern factory or mine, a complete blueprint is required. Therefore, design work is the first and most important stage of capital construction. It will not only determine the production fate of each factory and mine, but also represent how much of the state's materials and wealth, and how much of the people's labor, will be paid in every stroke and line. That is to say, whether the completed factory and mine are economically reasonable, technically advanced, and in line with the Party's construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" depends decisively on the design work, which bears a significant responsibility. However, before liberation, design work in our country was completely blank. After liberation, in order to meet the needs of the First Five-Year Plan construction, the Party transferred a group of experienced technical personnel from production factories and mines in 1953, and equipped them with a number of college graduates, to form design institutions. With the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, they learned how to prepare design books, how to establish technical and planning management systems for design, how to organize and improve design institutions, and how to quickly improve design standards. At the beginning, they could only cooperate with foreign designs and conduct some auxiliary design work under the guidance of Soviet experts; at most, they could only carry out replication and imitation designs by referring to foreign designs or equipment based on learning from the Soviet Union. The design progress of larger-scale factories and mines required: half a year for preliminary design, one year for technical design, and one and a half years for construction drawing design. Due to the rapid development of China's economic construction, the original long design time, slow delivery of drawings, and low technical level greatly affected the progress of capital construction and could not meet the needs of construction. Therefore, design work must catch up, the design team must be continuously expanded, and the design level must be greatly improved. Under the leadership of the Party, design workers, through successive political movements and socialist reform movements, corrected their political attitude, clarified that they must take the socialist road, carried out the struggle between the two roads of socialist design ideology and capitalist design ideology, and continuously corrected the design personnel's style of separating from reality and separating from the masses, further understanding that they must rely on the masses, and that the mass line must be followed, and that design work must also launch mass movements on a large scale. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, Chinese design workers conscientiously studied foreign advanced experience, combined it with China's national conditions, and creatively carried out new designs with the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and the combination of large, medium, and small projects. Everyone exerted great effort, strived for the upper reaches, emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, established ambition, made great aspirations, and boldly took on the design of most of the new and rebuilt projects in our country, all of which were designed domestically, and successfully completed all the design tasks assigned by the Party; especially in the year of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they broke through the constraints of outdated rules and regulations, and doubled the design progress; most design institutions completed design tasks equivalent to more than twice the sum of design tasks during the First Five-Year Plan period. They created fast design experience, and basically reversed the situation of design lagging behind construction.

The speed of the growth and expansion of China's design team in the past ten years is astonishing, and the improvement of China's design level is also astonishing. Our Liaoning Province's design institutions have grown from scratch, starting from the ground, and developed into the existing dozen professional design institutes and ten municipal design institutions. The multiple of the design team's growth cannot be calculated by numbers. In a short few years, they have completed many large-scale engineering design tasks, drawing more than 5.4 million original drawings, and printing blueprints with a width of one meter and a total length of about 7,000 kilometers. The total length of these blueprints can be laid from Shenyang to Beijing five times back and forth, including China's largest 1,513 cubic meter blast furnace, 660-ton open hearth furnace, a shale oil plant with an annual output of more than one million tons, and an open-pit mine that excavates 120 million cubic meters of shale and earthwork every year. If this is used to build a dike one meter high and one meter wide, it can surround the Earth's equator three times. In addition, many large-scale, technically complex, fully modernized factories, mines, reservoirs, and civil construction projects were also successfully designed by design personnel in the Liaoning area or under the guidance of Soviet experts.

Our Fushun Petroleum Design Institute is a professional design institute undertaking the construction of China's synthetic petroleum industry. Since its establishment at the end of 1956, it has only been three years. Under the correct leadership of the Party, with the help of Soviet experts and Czechoslovak experts, and with the research and efforts of all design personnel, the technical level of design business has been greatly improved. We are now fully capable of completing the entire design task of a large-scale and technically advanced synthetic petroleum plant. At the same time, in recent years, we have also engaged in many creative design projects, which not only play a huge role in China's petroleum industry construction, but also represent new achievements at the international technical level.

Since the second half of 1959, Chinese design workers have focused on standardization and matching in design methods, using charts, manuals, standardization, live assembly, and variable second original drawings to rapidly speed up design. Especially in recent months, with the revolution in design methods, the use of various analog resistance computers has realized the electrification of tedious and massive calculation work, and the drafting has realized live-plate assembly and printing, liberating the design personnel and drawing personnel who have been bending over the drawing board for years, greatly accelerating the design speed. Computational electrification and drafting live-plate printing have created favorable conditions for the factoryization of design, enabling highly complex mental labor to be changed from individual labor to collective labor. Organization and management can also be changed from a package deal for a certain project design to segmented operations like a factory. Due to the rapid improvement in work efficiency, new achievements in high-speed and high-quality have been created in design work. Taking the completion of the preliminary design and construction drawing tasks of a medium-sized aluminum plant by the Shenyang Aluminum-Magnesium Design Institute as an example, it took seven months in 1959, one month at the beginning of this year, and now it only takes fifteen days to complete. Another example is the Fushun Petroleum Design Institute. It only takes one to two days to design a coal-to-oil plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons of coal tar, from submitting design requirements to starting design and submitting construction drawings. Currently, many design institutes in China can complete the annual design tasks in only one quarter or at most half a year.

Although our design workers have achieved the above achievements under the correct leadership of the Party, we will never be satisfied with this. We must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to advance, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, go deep into reality, go to the site, achieve "three combinations", follow the mass line, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and sum up experience from practice to continuously improve the quality of design. We must resolutely and continuously implement the Party's general line for building socialism, both using less equipment, less materials, less investment, and less manpower, and achieving high production, high quality, and multiple varieties, to create conditions for the high-speed development of economic construction. We must creatively design more new technologies, new processes, new devices, new equipment, new materials, and new products, and strive to be more conducive to the current Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction. We must further advance from the design method revolution to the design product revolution. In the design of the petroleum industry, we must strive to achieve: turning high into short, turning large into small, turning heavy into light, turning complex into simple, turning long into short, and turning expensive into cheap, aiming at the high, large, heavy, complex, long, and expensive aspects of petroleum industrial devices and equipment. All waste residue, waste liquid, and waste gas should be transformed from useless to useful, from harmful to beneficial, combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying on our own efforts, fully utilizing resources, and giving full play to potential strength. Our design workers must continue to emancipate their minds, break superstitions, vigorously promote the design revolution, realize and consolidate the factoryization of design, march towards advanced technical levels, march towards scientific research work, march towards comprehensive utilization, create more miracles, and strive for greater leaps forward!

For the great socialist construction of the motherland, for the beautiful prospects of the motherland, although our design workers have made their greatest efforts and achieved continuous leaps forward, facing the current needs of the rapid development of the national economy, and for the need for an even greater increase in crude oil production in the next ten years as in the past ten years, this requires us to redouble our efforts and strive to complete this glorious task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. Therefore, in the future, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, put politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously promote the technical revolution, and forge ahead along the road of the Great Leap Forward!

    向更高的目标前进
    顾敬心代表谈设计工作的努力方向主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。我们确是在1958年大跃进的基础上继续实现了国民经济的大跃进；并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这是我国人民的伟大胜利，是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的伟大胜利，归根到底，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。1960年国民经济计划，是将更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，实现国民经济全面的更好的跃进；并且为以后年份的不断跃进创造条件。我们相信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，一定能够战胜任何困难，一定能够更加多快好省地继续大跃进，现在我要谈谈我国设计工作的大跃进。
    想建设一座现代化的工厂、矿山，就必须先有设计的完整蓝图。因之，设计工作是基本建设的第一重要关口，它不仅将决定每一个工厂、矿山的生产命运；而且在每一笔每条线中都表示要付出多少国家的物资和财富，多少人民的劳动。也就是说，建成后的工厂、矿山，经济上是否合理，技术上是否先进，是否符合党的多快好省的建设方针，设计工作有决定性的作用，担负着重大责任。可是在解放以前，我国设计工作完全是一个空白点。解放后，党为了适应第一个五年计划建设的需要，1953年起，就从生产厂矿抽调了一部份具有生产经验的技术人员，并配备了一部份大专毕业生，组成设计机构。在苏联专家的无私帮助下，学会怎样编制设计书，怎样建立设计上的技术管理和计划管理制度，怎样组织和健全设计机构，和怎样迅速提高设计水平。在刚开始的时候，都只能配合国外设计，在苏联专家的指导下，进行一些辅助设计工作；最多也只能在学习苏联的基础上，参考国外设计或设备进行复制模仿设计。较大规模厂矿设计进度则需：初步设计半年，技术设计一年，施工图设计一年半的时间。由于我国经济建设的迅速发展，原有的设计时间长，图纸交付慢，技术水平低，就大大影响了基本建设进度，不能满足施工需要。因此设计工作必须迎头赶上，必须不断地扩大设计队伍，大大地提高设计水平。在党的领导下，设计工作者，经过历次政治运动和社会主义改革运动，端正了政治态度，明确了必须走社会主义道路，进行了社会主义设计思想和资本主义设计思想之间两条道路的斗争，并不断地纠正设计人员中脱离实际，脱离群众的作风，进一步懂得要依靠群众，要走群众路线，设计工作也必须大搞群众运动。我国设计工作者，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，认真的学习国外先进经验，结合我国国情，创造性进行土洋结合，大中小结合等两条腿走路的新设计。大家鼓足干劲，力争上游，解放思想，破除迷信，树雄心，立大志，大胆地担负起我国绝大部分新建和改建工程，均由国内自己进行设计，并出色地完成了党所交给的全部设计任务；尤其在全国大跃进的1958年，冲破陈规旧律的束缚，成倍地提高了设计进度；大多数设计机构完成的设计任务，等于第一个五年计划时期内设计任务总和的二倍以上。创造了快速设计经验，基本上扭转了设计跟不上施工的局面。
    十年来我国设计队伍成长壮大的速度是惊人的，同时我国设计水平的提高也是惊人的。我们辽宁省的设计机构是从无到有，平地起家，发展成现有的十几个专业设计院和十个市属的设计机构，设计队伍的增长倍数，就无法以数字来计算了。在短短的几年中完成了很多较大工程设计任务，共描成五百四十多万张底图，晒出合一米宽约七千多公里长的蓝图。这些蓝图的总长度，可以从沈阳到北京铺五个来回，其中包括有我国最大的一千五百十三立方米高炉，六百六十吨平炉，年产一百万吨以上的页岩油厂，每年要挖掘出页岩和土方一亿二千万立方米的露天矿。如果以此来筑成一条一米高一米宽的大堤，可以围绕地球赤道三周。此外还有很多规模宏大，技术复杂，全部现代化的工厂、矿山、水库，和民用建筑等工程设计，也都是由辽宁地区的设计人员自行设计或在苏联专家指导下胜利完成的。
    我们抚顺石油设计院是承担我国人造石油工业建设的专业设计院。自1956年年底成立到现在，只有三年多时间，在党的正确领导下，苏联专家和捷克斯洛伐克专家的帮助下，和全体设计人员的钻研努力下，设计业务技术水平都有很大提高，我们已能完全胜任规模较大，技术先进的人造石油厂全部设计任务。同时几年来，并从事了不少具有创造意义的设计工程，不但对我国石油工业建设起着巨大作用，而且在国际技术水平上也是新的成就。
    从1959年下半年起，我国设计工作者，在设计方法上，以定型配套为中心，采用图表、手册、定型、活报装配和变制第二底图等手段，使设计速度飞跃地加快，尤其在最近几个月来，进行设计方法大革命，采用各种模拟式电阻计算机，使繁琐的大量的计算工作实现了电气化，制图实现了活板装配和印刷化，解放了常年伏身于图板上的设计人员和描图人员，使设计速度大大加快，计算电气化和制图活板印刷化为设计工厂化创造了有利条件，使高度复杂的脑力劳动，可从个体劳动改变为集体劳动。组织管理也可以由某项工程设计一包到底，变为像工厂一样分段作业。由于工作效率飞速提高，在设计工作上，创造了高速度，优质量的新成就，以沈阳铝镁设计院完成一座中型铝厂的初步设计和施工图任务为例，在1959年需七个月，今年年初需一个月，现在只需十五天可以完成。又如抚顺石油设计院，设计一个年产一万吨煤焦油的煤炼油厂，从提出设计要求到着手设计提交施工图纸，只要一天到二天时间，全部完成。目前我国很多设计院，仅用一季或顶多半年时间，可完成全年设计任务。
    虽然我们设计工作者，在党的正确领导下，获得了以上成就，但我们绝不以此为满足，我们要戒骄戒躁，持续前进，要大搞技术革新与技术革命，深入实际，下现场，做到“三结合”，走群众路线，发挥群众的积极性与创造性，从实践中总结经验，以不断改进与提高设计的质量。要坚决持续贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线，既要少用设备，少用材料，少用投资，少用人力，又要高产优质多品种，为高速度地发展经济建设创造条件。我们要创造性的设计出更多的新技术、新流程、新装置、新设备、新材料、新产品，力争更有利于当前工农业建设的大跃进，我们要进一步从设计方法革命到设计产品革命。像石油工业的设计中，应针对石油工业装置及设备的高、大、重、繁、长、贵等方面，必须力争作到：化高为矮、化大为小、化重为轻、化繁为简、化长为短、化贵为贱，并应把所有废渣，废液，废气，化无用为有用，变有害为有利，土洋结合，自力更生，充分利用资源发挥潜在力量。我们设计工作者，必须继续解放思想，破除迷信，大闹设计革命，实现和巩固设计工厂化，向先进技术水平进军，向科学研究工作进军，向综合利用进军，创造更多的奇迹，力求更大的跃进！
    为祖国伟大的社会主义建设，为祖国美好的远景，虽然我们设计工作者，尽了最大的努力，取得了不断的跃进。但面对着当前国民经济飞跃发展的需要，对于今后十年要像过去十年一样原油产量还要更大的增长，这就要求我们加倍努力，力争提前和超额完成这一光荣任务。因此今后我们更要高举毛泽东思想红旗，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，沿着大跃进的道路，奋勇前进！
