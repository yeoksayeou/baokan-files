Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: Washington - Indications show that the United States is plotting to misappropriate the United Nations' name once again, further interfering in the situation in South Korea.

According to United Press International on the 27th, citing Washington "diplomatic sources," given that Syngman Rhee has submitted his resignation, the United States "may request the United Nations to supervise new elections in South Korea."

The report stated that American officials said that the decision made by the United States and its thirteen Korean War allies at a meeting held at the State Department on the 26th was: "to wait for the situation to develop further, and then decide whether the United Nations should intervene in the political situation again."

Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th dispatch: The "Daily Express" yesterday, in a report on the meeting convened by the United States with representatives of the fourteen countries that participated in the Korean War, revealed that the United States is plotting to misappropriate the United Nations' name once again to have other aggressor nations send troops to South Korea.

An article from Washington published by the newspaper stated: "The possibility of British troops becoming involved in the Korean turmoil has been raised in Washington today." It said, "Currently, there are no British or Commonwealth troops in Korea. But American officials do not rule out the possibility of sending UN reinforcements to Korea if the political situation there deteriorates."

The "Daily Express" also stated that political observers believe that "the United States is trying to get other UN countries that participated in the Korean War to agree with the new policy that the United States is pursuing there."

    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：有迹象表明，美国正阴谋再一次盗用联合国名义，进一步干涉南朝鲜局势。
    据合众国际社27日援引华盛顿的“外交人士”的话说，鉴于李承晚已经提出辞职，美国“有可能要求联合国监督南朝鲜的新选举”。
    消息说，美国官员说，美国同它的十三个侵朝盟国26日在美国国务院举行会议作出的决定是：“等待局势进一步发展，然后决定联合国是否应当再度干预政治局势。”
    新华社伦敦28日电　“每日快报”昨天在报道美国召集参加侵略朝鲜战争的十四个国家的代表开会的消息中透露，美国阴谋再次盗用联合国的名义要其他侵朝国家派军队到南朝鲜去。
    这家报纸刊载的一篇发自华盛顿的文章写道：“今天在华盛顿提出了英国军队将卷入朝鲜骚动中的可能性”。它说，“目前在朝鲜并没有英国或英联邦的军队。但是美国官员并不排斥在那里的政局恶化的时候派联合国组织增援部队到朝鲜去的可能性”。
    “每日快报”还说，政治观察家认为，“美国正在设法使参加朝鲜战争的其他联合国组织国家赞成美国在那里奉行的新政策”。
