This newspaper reports from Kunming on April 14th: Since November of last year, Yunnan Province has not had a thorough rain for five months. Under the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, the people of the province have launched a spring plowing production upsurge centered on drought resistance like a storm. In this severe struggle, Yiliang County has become an advanced model.

The Yiliang County Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, concentrated the wisdom of the masses and formulated a combat plan called "One Burst of Energy, Two Resolutions, Three Lines of Defense" to win a bumper harvest in this year's drought resistance. This plan has attracted the attention of the broad masses. The so-called "one burst of energy" means correctly analyzing the current situation, fully mobilizing and educating the masses, so that everyone is determined to "reap a bumper harvest in years of severe drought," giving full play to subjective initiative, and uniting into a force to turn a year of severe drought into a year of bumper harvest. The "two resolutions" are: resolutely expand the cultivated area and resolutely organize large-scale high-yield production, combining high-yield and more harvest with more planting and more harvest. The so-called "three lines of defense" are: the first line is to plant high-yield crops on high-yield plots to achieve high-yield and more harvest. Utilize the favorable conditions of drought and high temperature to truly make the 350,000 mu of basic farmland in the county with water conservancy guarantees "one mu equals two mu," to achieve large-scale high yields. Achieving this goal will guarantee the completion of the year's grain production plan. The second line of defense is to plant more and harvest more. Immediately make all preparations, and as soon as the rain falls, immediately adopt the method of large-scale troop operations to rush to plant all 170,000 mu of general farmland in the county, ensuring good planting and management. The third line of defense is to seize the gaps and rush to reclaim 200,000 mu of wasteland, taking advantage of the abundant summer rainfall to vigorously plant late autumn crops. The victorious realization of these three lines of defense can greatly exceed the original plan for grain production, turning a major drought and major difficulties into a major good thing. This deployment has been warmly supported by the broad masses of cadres and people in the county. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also emphasized: This is an advanced and practical deployment. The Provincial Party Committee called on the party committees in all parts of the province to quickly make deployments like those in Yiliang and quickly implement them in communes, management areas, and production teams.

In 1959, Yiliang County increased its grain production by 6.7% in both the small and large spring harvests. This year, in order to strive for an overall increase in production, the County Party Committee went deep into the commune members and summed up the experience of increasing production with everyone. They discovered the following situation: The production conditions in the plains areas are generally better than in the mountainous areas, but the production in some plains areas is not as good as in the mountainous areas, and the yield of some good fields is not as high as that of barren fields. This shows that the county still has great potential for increasing production. The County Party Committee also considered: The drier the climate, the more it is necessary to strive for high yields on water-retaining fields as a guarantee for achieving continuous leaps forward this year; at the same time, it does not give up expanding the cultivated area. The County Party Committee concentrated the various measures proposed by the masses, systematically improved them, and formed the "One Burst of Energy, Two Resolutions, Three Lines of Defense" combat plan.

After the County Party Committee put forward the "Three Lines of Defense" measures, the cadres and masses of the whole county warmly supported them, and they said: The County Party Committee has made the right move, a tough move, and a decisive move. The spring plowing production movement centered on drought resistance is even more vibrant. From the county, communes, management areas, to production teams, all have formulated their own three lines of defense plans, adhering to the spirit of "focusing on the first line, actively preparing for the second line, and striving for the third line," grasping the present and grasping drought resistance. Of the thirty-six large and small water conservancy projects in the county that will benefit this year, thirty-five projects have been completed after concentrated efforts, and water has been stored. In all places with water sources, there is a great effort to seal ditches and cut off streams, controlling the water in the rivers. In places with less surface water and more groundwater, wells are dug, ponds are excavated, and dams are built to store water. At the same time, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods is adopted to build water-lifting tools. Now, the area with guaranteed irrigation that has been effectively implemented throughout the county has reached more than 210,000 mu.

Excerpts from the Approval of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China:

Dry weather without rain is originally a bad thing, but our province already has a certain foundation in water conservancy. As long as we rely on our hard work to guarantee water conservancy and irrigation, we can fully utilize the factors of high temperature brought about by drought, which is conducive to the growth of crops, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and turning a year of great drought into a year of great harvest. Regarding the issue of drought, people often have two attitudes: One type of person sees the difficult side and then relies on the subjective initiative of people to develop objectively favorable conditions and overcome those unfavorable conditions. The Yiliang County Party Committee has adopted this attitude. They do not rely on heaven and wait for rain, but pin their hopes on their own hands and wisdom, placing the achievement of this year's production plan in the first place, and using the second and third hands as backups. This is completely different from those who pin their hopes on luck. People with a mentality of luck always pin their hopes on the next hand, hoping for a good large spring harvest if the small spring harvest fails, and hoping for more planting if high yield fails, rather than placing the hope of a bumper harvest on the present, acting vigorously and not letting go of every second. This is a psychological reflection of a lazy person and a coward. People with this kind of mentality, although they are a minority, must be resolutely opposed.

### 一股劲头　两个坚决　三道防线  宜良抗住大旱誓夺丰收  云南省委号召各县狠抓当前生产措施层层落实

    一股劲头　两个坚决　三道防线
    宜良抗住大旱誓夺丰收
    云南省委号召各县狠抓当前生产措施层层落实
    本报昆明14日电　从去年11月到目前为止，云南省已经五个月未下透雨。全省人民在云南省委的领导下，急风骤雨似地展开了以抗旱为中心的春耕生产热潮。在这场严重的斗争中，宜良县成了先进典型。
    宜良县委根据省委的指示，集中了群众智慧，制定了一个叫做“一股劲头、两个坚决、三道防线”的夺取今年抗旱大丰收的战斗计划，这个计划引起了广大群众的注意。所谓一股劲头，就是正确地分析当前形势，充分发动群众和教育群众，使人人抱定“越是大旱年，越要大丰收”的决心，充分发挥主观能动性，拧成一股变大旱年为大丰收的劲头。两个坚决是：坚决扩大耕地面积，坚决组织大面积高产，把高产多收和多种多收结合起来。所谓三道防线，第一道是大种高产作物丰产片，实现高产多收。利用干旱气温高的有利条件，使全县有水利保证的三十五万亩基本农田，真正做到“一亩顶两亩用”，达到大面积高产。实现这项指标，就能保证完成今年全年的粮食生产计划。第二道防线是多种多收。立即做好一切准备，只要雨水落地，立即采取大兵团作战的方法，把全县十七万亩一般农田全部突击栽种下去，保证种好管好。第三道防线是抓紧空隙突击开垦二十万亩荒地，利用夏季雨水充沛的条件，大抓一把晚秋作物。这三道防线的胜利实现，粮食产量可以大大超过原计划，变大干旱大困难为大好事。这个部署受到了全县广大干部群众的热烈拥护。中共云南省委也强调指出：这是一个既先进又落实的部署。省委号召全省各地党委都能迅速作出像宜良那样的部署，并迅速落实到公社、管理区和生产队。
    宜良县1959年大小春粮食增产了6.7％。今年为了争取全面增产，县委深入到社员中，和大家一起总结增产经验。发现这样一种情况：平坝区生产条件一般都比山区好，但是有些坝区的生产却赶不上山区，有些好田的产量也不如瘦田的产量高。这表明全县增产潜力还很大。县委又考虑到：气候越旱，越要在保水田上争高产，作为实现今年连续跃进的保证；同时，也不放弃扩大耕地面积。县委把群众提出的各项措施集中起来，加以系统提高，便形成了“一个劲头，两个坚决，三道防线”的战斗计划。
    县委提出“三道防线”的措施以后，全县的干部群众热烈拥护，纷纷反映说：县委这步棋走对了，走得硬，走得狠。以抗旱为中心的春耕生产运动更加有声有色。从县、公社、管理区到生产队，都订出了自己的三道防线计划，本着“重点抓第一道，积极准备第二道，努力争取第三道”的精神，狠抓当前，狠抓抗旱。全县三十六件今年受益的大小水利工程，经过集中突击，现在三十五件工程都已完成，并且蓄起了水。一切有水源的地方，都大干封沟断流，把水控制在江河里边。地面水少、地下水多的地方，打井、挖塘、筑坝把水蓄起来。同时，采取土洋结合的办法，大造提水工具。现在，全县扎扎实实落实下来的保灌面积，已达二十一万多亩。
    中共云南省委批语摘要：
    天旱不雨，本是一件坏事，但是我省水利已有一定基础，只要依靠我们的艰苦努力，保证水利灌溉，却可以充分利用干旱所带来的气温高、有利于农作物生长的因素，把不利条件化为有利条件，变大旱年为大丰年。对于干旱这件事，人们往往有两种态度：一种人是既看到困难的一面，然后依靠人的主观能动作用，去发展客观有利条件，克服那些不利条件。宜良县委就是采取了这种态度，他们不是靠天等雨，而是把希望寄托于自己的双手和智慧，把实现今年生产计划的指靠放在第一手，而用第二手、第三手作后备，这和那种把希望寄托在侥幸上的人们完全是两回事。有侥幸心理的人总是把希望寄托在下一手，小春不行望大春，高产不行望多种，而不把大丰收的希望首先放在当前，雷厉风行，分秒不让。这是一种懒汉和懦夫的心理反映。具有这种心理的人，虽然是少数的，但却必须坚决地反对。
