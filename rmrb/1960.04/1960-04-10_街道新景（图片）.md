    New Look of the Streets
    Miu Yintang
    The whole family's clothes are washed by someone,
    Three meals a day are eaten in the canteen,
    Purchases are delivered by the shop assistant,
    Mom and younger brother are both at work,
    Only grandma is bored at home,
    Now she's also a street service worker.

    街道新景

    全家衣服有人洗
    每天食堂吃三餐
    买物品有售货员送上
    妈妈弟弟都上班
    只有奶奶在家闲得慌
    如今也当了街道服务员
