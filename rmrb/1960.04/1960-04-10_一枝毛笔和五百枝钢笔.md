    One Writing Brush and Five Hundred Fountain Pens
    From Lanzhou, Ji Chengjia
    Some time ago, in the mass cultural creation exhibition room of Chenshan Village, Xihe People's Commune, Xihe County, Gansu Province, I saw a heartening contrast: this village has only dozens of households, and in the early days of liberation, there was only one writing brush, but now there are already five hundred fountain pens! One and five hundred – although this is a simple number, it contains incredibly rich content. It vividly and powerfully illustrates that the laboring people, along with their political and economic emancipation, are also eagerly demanding cultural emancipation to become the masters of culture. Just as on the production front, on the cultural front, they are breaking down superstitions, demonstrating soaring revolutionary vigor, and achieving brilliant accomplishments.
    In the unprecedented cultural revolution, Chenshan Village fully demonstrated the broad spirit and tenacious fighting will of the laboring people, transforming from an illiterate village to a cultural village in a very short period. Following the literacy campaign and reading movement, a mass cultural creation movement was launched. A large number of activists have emerged in mass creation, writing many essays, short stories, and poems. These works praise the Party, praise the Great Leap Forward, are full of political enthusiasm, and also show the writing talents of the farmers, rapidly expanding the army of cultural creation. And five hundred fountain pens are not the end; with future development, the number of five hundred will continue to increase and change, and more people will pick up pens.
    One writing brush and five hundred fountain pens not only illustrate the cultural emancipation of Chenshan Village, but also the epitome of the cultural emancipation of the entire Chinese workers and peasants.

    一枝毛笔和五百枝钢笔
    兰州市　季成家
    前些时候，在甘肃省西礼县西和人民公社陈山村的群众文艺创作展览室里，看到了一个令人欢欣鼓舞的对比：这个村只有几十户人家，解放初共有一枝毛笔，而现在已经有五百枝钢笔了！一和五百，这虽是一个简单的数字，却包含了无比丰富的内容。它生动有力地说明：劳动人民，随着政治经济上的翻身，也迫切地要求在文化上翻身，做文化的主人。像在生产战线上一样，在文化战线上，他们也破除迷信，表现了冲天的革命干劲，取得了辉煌的成就。
    陈山村在空前的文化革命中，充分显示了劳动人民的宏大的气概，顽强的斗志，在很短的时期内一变文盲村而为文化村。紧接着扫盲、读书运动，又开展了文艺创作运动。在群众创作中已经涌现出一大批积极分子，写出了不少的散文、短篇小说、诗歌，这些作品歌颂了党，歌颂了大跃进，充满了政治热情，也显出了农民们的写作才华，迅速地壮大了文艺创作大军。而五百枝钢笔也还不是止境，随着今后的发展，五百枝的数字还要不断增加变化，将有更多的人拿起笔来。
    一枝毛笔和五百枝钢笔，不仅仅说明了陈山村的文化翻身，其实也正是整个中国工农文化翻身的缩影。
