Comrades Chairman, Representatives, and Committee Members:

　　I listened with boundless excitement to Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan,” Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft,” and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin’s “Report on Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule.” These three reports present a magnificent picture of continued leaps forward, which will inspire and encourage the people of the whole country to be more spirited and high-spirited. On the basis of the continuous great leaps forward in the past two years and the good start in the first quarter of this year, they will surely advance victoriously, complete the 1960 national economic plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target, and achieve a good start in the first year of the 1960s.

　　The Strong Sons and Daughters of Hunan Hold High the Red Flag and Continuously Leap Forward

　　Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, the strong sons and daughters of Hunan hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People’s Commune, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, and go all out. Like the people of other provinces, Hunan has achieved extremely brilliant achievements in all fields of industry, agriculture, culture, education, health, finance, and trade in 1959. The people of our province suffered particularly from the drought in the summer and autumn of last year, and used all their strength to exchange for a particularly large harvest. There is no need to say much about this extraordinary event. Now I will briefly talk about the Great Leap Forward in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture governs ten counties, bordering the three provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, and Hubei. Before liberation, this area was closed off, economically backward, and the most closed off, remote, and impoverished area in Hunan. In order to see the changes and developments in this area over the past ten years, I made a special trip to the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture at the end of last year for an inspection. We saw that the autonomous prefecture after liberation, especially after the continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, has completely changed its past appearance and become a paradise for people of all ethnic groups. Before liberation, the autonomous prefecture had no modern industry at all except for a very small number of scattered individual handicrafts. After liberation, the industry of the autonomous prefecture has developed greatly. Especially after the Great Steel Smelting Campaign in 1958, a high tide of large-scale industrial development, led by steel and driving everything else, was set off throughout the prefecture. Every county ran industry, every commune ran industry, and even every team ran industry. There were more than 4,500 factories, mines, and enterprises of varying sizes in total. Last year, the drought in the autonomous prefecture was relatively serious. The drought period in each county lasted more than 120 days, averaging about 90 days. At the same time, plant diseases and insect pests threatened the growth of crops from spring sowing to autumn harvest. However, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups worked hard and finally overcame the drought and wiped out the insect pests, and won a bumper harvest. The total grain output reached 1.4 billion catties, an increase of 10% compared with 1958, that is, an average of about 750 catties per person. With the development of economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the prefecture have also made a leap forward. Before liberation, more than 90% of the people were illiterate. Now primary education has been basically universalized, and the first university - Jishou University - has been established. There are a total of 319,500 students in the prefecture, an increase of 23.8 times compared with before liberation. Diseases such as plague, smallpox, cholera, and malaria, which were prevalent before liberation, have completely disappeared, and other diseases have also been greatly reduced. Loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene have become a social custom and habit. What is even more commendable is that under the brilliant light of the Party's great ethnic policy, in the process of fighting against common enemies and in the common production and labor of marching toward nature, the unity among the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture has become as solid as a rock, and the communist style of mutual support and mutual cooperation has been formed. For example, there is a river in Huayuan County, now called "Brothers River," which was formerly called "Miao River." Before liberation, a folk song was popular here: "The Miao River flows clearly through the slope, the Miao and Han ethnic groups sit across the river, although they drink the same river water, the two banks of the Miao and Han each manage their own." The renaming of "Miao River" to "Brothers River" reflects the fundamental changes in ethnic relations. In 1958, the two banks formed a people's commune, and the Miao and Han became a family. In order to change the situation of being vulnerable to drought in previous years, the people of the two ethnic groups and the Tujia people living dozens of miles away built a reservoir on the bank of the Brothers River, thereby changing the situation of the slope land on both sides of the Brothers River relying on the sky for food for a long time. The south bank of the Brothers River is blooming with the flower of national friendship. During our inspection, we visited the Miao ethnic group's Aizhai People's Commune in Jishou County and the Tanxi People's Commune in Luxi County, both of which had experienced 120 days of severe drought. The ponds were cracked and the rivers were cut off. The people worked together to dredge wells for irrigation, and finally overcame the difficulties. Now, not only is there no trace of the disaster, but the five grains are abundant, the six domestic animals are prosperous, the people are in high spirits, and there is a joyful atmosphere. Industrial production is constantly growing, and a new atmosphere of a good start has emerged. There are really thousands of new things, talents emerge in large numbers, a bright future, and songs of praise fill the air. We also visited canteens, homes for the elderly, nurseries, primary schools, and factories, all of which were well-organized and very neat, as perfect as those run by the people's communes in other regions. From the tremendous changes in the poorest and most backward autonomous prefecture, it is not difficult for people to imagine the full picture of the Great Leap Forward in Hunan Province. This is the result of the mass movement of vigorously engaging in revolution under the correct leadership of the Party, a great victory of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and an ironclad proof of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　Production High Tide is Higher than Another

　　Now is the first spring of the 1960s. Like all parts of the country, Hunan is showing a scene of prosperity and vigorous development everywhere. The production situation in industry, capital construction, and transportation in the province is very good. The movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, is developing wave after wave. Production in January and February steadily increased on the basis of the continuous great leaps forward in the past two years, entering a new stage of sustained leap forward. Thirty million collective farmers in Hunan have set lofty aspirations, and their enthusiasm is soaring. They have launched a magnificent and vigorous high tide of large-scale production centered on spring plowing. In 1960, the province aims to increase grain production by 10% on the basis of 1959, cotton by 800,000 dan, edible vegetable oil by 2.5 million dan, and raise 40 million pigs, striving to achieve an average of 1,000 catties of grain and one pig per person in the province. The realization of this grand plan will greatly change the economic face of our province.

　　In order to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is sweeping Hunan Province. It has become a great mass movement. Innovation flowers are blooming everywhere, and good news of production is frequently reported. Since the beginning of this year, in less than a month, the degree of mechanization of loading and unloading and transportation in the province has increased from 5% to 70%. Nearly half of the coal mines above the county level have realized the one-dragon-style mechanization of the whole process from production to transportation, combining indigenous and foreign methods. In terms of the machinery industry, 270 automatic production lines and 1,068 production assembly lines have emerged. The light industry has focused on the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and trial-produced 607 new products. The vast number of workers have been liberated from a large amount of manual labor and heavy labor, and they are all happy and sing praises with enthusiasm. For example, the porters sing: "In the past, there was a lot of backlog of materials, but now the materials go uphill by themselves. It's easy and fast to work, and you see how happy we are." The result of mechanization has greatly improved labor productivity. For example, 17 coal mines in Hengyang Prefecture have realized the "one-dragon" mechanization of indigenous and foreign methods. Not only has the daily output increased from the original 6,200 tons to 10,000 tons, but also more than 7,800 people have been reduced from the original 20,000 laborers. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has not only yielded fruitful results economically, but also the political ideology and mental outlook of the vast number of workers have undergone tremendous changes. The communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has been greatly developed. The workers sing: "I want to climb the sky, I want to drill the earth; there is nothing difficult in front of heroes, and collective wisdom is better than immortals." What a heroic spirit of truly "not being afraid of heaven or earth"!

　　In terms of agricultural production, first of all, agricultural infrastructure construction has appeared in the vast rural areas of the province on an unprecedented scale and speed. Since last winter, nearly 7 million people have participated in water conservancy construction, and 1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed by the end of February this year. This is equivalent to more than 40% of the total amount of earth and stone completed for water conservancy in the province in the ten years since liberation. The province has renovated and newly built 880,000 water conservancy projects, and the amount of water stored for farmland irrigation alone has increased by 4.4 billion cubic meters, which will greatly improve the drought resistance capacity of 43 million mu of paddy fields in the province and ensure a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice paddies. After the 16 newly built power generation projects and small hydropower projects, mainly for power generation, are all installed, the installed capacity will reach 1.08 million kilowatts. The province has generally established large and medium-sized main projects in small reservoir groups, and auxiliary small projects have been established on the periphery of the main reservoirs. The main projects and auxiliary projects are connected into a new type of drainage and irrigation network with channels, so as to achieve the connection of ponds and reservoirs, the result that long vines produce melons, the convergence of all waters, the comprehensive utilization, and constitute a magnificent picture of transforming nature and beautifying mountains and rivers. At present, more than 200 of the province's 800-odd larger rivers have been managed according to basin plans, and in many places, new scenes of "man-made seas on high mountains, canals surpassing the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, water flowing overhead, and sailboats coming to the mountains" have appeared. With the deepening of the spring plowing production movement, the massive agricultural technical transformation movement is vigorously developing throughout the province, and has already achieved great results. The province has created and improved more than 100 kinds of tools and popularized more than 3 million pieces. In terms of technical innovation and technical revolution, the focus is on mechanization and semi-mechanization, as well as the serialization of production, engaging in one-dragon and several-dragon complete sets. For example, Hengyang County has done a very good job in this regard, selecting hundreds of well-improved agricultural tools to form a complete set, and engaging in five dragons: a farming dragon, a livestock feed processing dragon, an agricultural and sideline product processing dragon, a transportation tool dragon, and a living tool dragon. With the five dragons flying, the productivity quickly increased by more than double. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "In terms of agricultural mechanization, our goal is to strive to solve the problem in a small way in four years, solve it in seven years, and solve it in a big way in ten years, starting from 1959. In about ten years, we will strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization and water conservancy in the country, and realize a considerable degree of electrification." Judging from the current development situation in Hunan Province, I believe that we will definitely be able to achieve the targets put forward by the Central Committee ahead of schedule.

　　Let Heaven Bow its Head to Us, and Let Imperialism Tremble Before Us

　　Looking at the whole country from Hunan, I have absolute confidence in realizing the 1960 national economic plan and exceeding all targets. The three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are infinitely powerful, and Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. We must set off a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country. The 650 million people hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the three magic weapons, and we can overcome any natural disasters and man-made disasters. Let Heaven bow its head to us, and let imperialism and all reactionaries tremble before us!

　　The imperialists, especially the US imperialists, once used the verification of agricultural production in China in 1958 and the adjustment of the national economic plan targets in 1959 to fabricate rumors and slanders against China; when they could not cover up the facts of China's Great Leap Forward and all the lies were bankrupt, they fabricated the myth of the so-called "Chinese aggression threat," attempting to deceive and intimidate some ignorant people and sow discord between us and the people of Southeast Asian countries. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that this trick of the US imperialists is in vain. After China and Burma signed the border agreement and the treaty of non-aggression, we recently signed the border agreement with Nepal. This is a major victory for China's peaceful foreign policy, a major victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and powerfully shattered all the slanders of so-called "Chinese aggression" and "Chinese expansion." Facts have proved that the countries bordering China not only do not have any threat of "Chinese aggression" on the border, but are the safest peaceful borders. As long as they are not ill-intentioned and exploited by others, the border issues left over from history can be completely resolved reasonably. We fully support our government's policy on the Sino-Indian border issue. Premier Zhou Enlai accepted Premier Nehru's invitation to visit Delhi. This fact itself once again shows that the Chinese people cherish the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, and take the overall situation as the most important thing in everything. I believe that as long as the Indian government has the same wish and sincerity, it is not difficult to find a reasonable solution to the problem. We respect ourselves and never scold other countries wantonly.

　　Who is adhering to the war policy of aggression and who is adhering to the policy of peace, nothing is more eloquent than the facts. More than 80% of China's 1960 national budget expenditure is used for economic and cultural construction, and the proportion of defense expenditure is only 8.3%. In sharp contrast to this situation, military expenditure accounts for as much as 57.1% of the US government's 1960-1961 budget expenditure. As Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out: "It fully illustrates the ardent desire of the Chinese people to engage in peaceful labor and their firm determination to reduce defense expenditures and accelerate socialist construction. At the same time, this fact also fully exposes the true face of US imperialism, which is a fake peace and real preparation for war." The Chinese government signed a treaty of non-aggression with the Burmese government; the US government colluded with the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government and signed the US-Japan military alliance aimed at launching new armed aggression in the Far East, and recently held provocative joint military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, refused to accept the Soviet Union's sincere and reasonable disarmament proposals at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, and carried out various subversive activities in Latin America, threatening Cuba and suppressing the national independence movement of the Latin American people, and carrying out conspiracies of aggression in Africa. All this clearly tells us that we must not relax our due vigilance against US imperialism just because the US imperialists are forced by the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind to put on some peaceful gestures to ease the international situation. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We cannot forget that US imperialism still occupies our sacred territory Taiwan. We absolutely cannot allow the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" to succeed. The great Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu and realize the complete unification of the motherland.

　　Comrades Representatives and Committee Members, we have achieved great achievements in the past, and are in an even greater era, facing an even greater task. Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, not only illuminates the road for us to build socialism at high speed, but also illuminates the road for us to transition from socialism to the most beautiful society of mankind - communist society. I am an old man who is nearly eighty years old and has spent a long time in old China. I feel immensely happy and proud to be able to see the achievements of socialist construction in my old age and to be a part of the people of the great new China. Today, I, along with 650 million people, am wholeheartedly following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road, and tomorrow I will happily enter communist society with the Communist Party. This is something that everyone agrees on and is worth celebrating. In fact, the sprouts of communism are shining with soaring light on the vast land of our great motherland's cities and villages.

专栏：

    从湖南看全国
    程潜副委员长在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
  　我怀着无限兴奋的心情，听到了李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”、谭震林副总理“关于提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告”。这三个报告把一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的图画展现在我们的面前，全国人民在它的激励和鼓舞下，必将更为意气风发，斗志昂扬，一定能够在过去两年连续大跃进和今年第一季度开门红的基础上，乘胜前进，提前和超额完成1960年国民经济计划，实现六十年代第一年的满堂红。
    三湘健儿高举红旗不断跃进
    我们湖南的人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在中共中央和湖南省委的正确领导下，三湘健儿高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，湖南同其他各省人民一样，1959年无论在工业、农业、文教卫生、财贸各个战线上，都取得了极其辉煌灿烂的成就。我省人民受到去年夏秋两季特别的旱灾，用全副力量换得了特别大的丰收。这桩不平凡的事情无庸多述。现在我专就湘西土家族苗族自治州大跃进的情况，略举大概来说一说。土家族苗族自治州共辖十个县，与黔、川、鄂三省边界接壤，解放前这个地区交通闭塞，经济落后，是湖南最闭塞最偏僻最困苦的一个地区。为了看一看这个地区十年来的变化和发展，我在去年年底曾特意到湘西土家族苗族自治州等地进行了一次视察。我们看到解放后的自治州，特别是经过1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，已经完全改变了昔日的面貌，成为一个各族人民的乐园。解放前，自治州除了极少数零星分散的个体手工业外，根本没有现代工业。解放后，自治州的工业有了很大的发展，特别是1958年大炼钢铁以后，全州掀起了一个以钢为纲、带动一切的大办工业的高潮，县县办工业，社社办工业，甚至队队办工业，大小不一的厂矿企业单位，总共在四千五百个以上。去年自治州干旱较为严重，各县旱期多到一百二十天，平均达九十来天，同时病虫害从春播到秋收一直威胁着农作物的生长，但是各族人民在各级党委的领导下，艰苦奋斗，终于战胜了旱魔，扑灭了虫害，夺得了丰收；粮食总产量达十四亿斤，比1958年增加了10％，即每人平均为七百五十斤左右。随着经济建设的发展和人民生活水平的提高，全州的文教卫生事业也有了飞跃的进步。解放前，90％以上的人是文盲，现在已经基本上普及了小学教育，还创办了第一所大学——吉首大学，全州共有学生三十一万九千五百多人，比解放前增加二十三点八倍。解放前流行的鼠疫、天花、霍乱和瘧疾等病已经完全绝迹，其它疾病也大大减少，爱清洁，讲卫生，已经形成一种社会风尚和习惯。更值得称道的是，在党的伟大的民族政策光辉照耀下，在同共同敌人进行斗争的过程中和向自然大进军的共同生产劳动的过程中，自治州各族人民之间的团结已经坚如磐石，互相支持、互相协作的共产主义风尚已经形成。例如花垣县有一条河，现在叫“兄弟河”，过去叫“苗河”。解放前在这里流行着一首山歌：“苗河清清流过坡，苗汉两族隔河坐，虽然同饮一江水，两岸苗汉各管各。”“苗河”改名为“兄弟河”，反映了民族关系的根本变化，在1958年，两岸更组成一个人民公社，苗汉成了一家人。为了改变历年易受旱灾的情况，两族人民和居住几十里路远的土家族，在兄弟河畔修建了一座水库，从而改变了兄弟河两岸坡土长期以来靠天吃饭的局面，兄弟河南岸正盛开着民族友谊的花朵。我们这次视察，访问了吉首县的苗族的矮寨人民公社和泸溪县澶溪人民公社，都是经过一百二十天的严重旱灾地区，干到池塘龟裂，河川断流，人民合力浚井灌溉，终然克复。现在不但不见灾情的痕迹，反而得到五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，群情振奋，喜气洋洋；工业生产不断增长，出现满堂红的新气象。真是新事千万，人才辈出，一片光明，讴歌载道。我们还参观了食堂、敬老院、托儿所、小学校、工厂，都办得井井有条，非常整齐，和他区人民公社所办的一样完善。从最穷最白的自治州的巨大变化，人们不难想见湖南全省大跃进的全貌。这是在党的正确领导下，大搞革命的群众运动的结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利的一个铁证。
    生产高潮一浪高似一浪
    现在是六十年代的第一个春天，湖南和全国各地一样，到处都呈现一片欣欣向荣、蓬勃发展的气象。全省工业生产、基本建设和交通运输方面的生产情况很好，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动正一浪高似一浪地向前发展，1、2月份生产在两年连续大跃进的基础上稳步上升，进入了持续跃进的新阶段。三千万集体农民树雄心、立大志，干劲冲天，热情奔放，展开了规模宏伟、气势磅礴的以春耕为中心的大生产高潮；1960年全省要求粮食在1959年的基础上增产一成，棉花八十万担，食用植物油二百五十万担，养猪四千万头，争取实现全省平均每人千斤粮、一头猪。这一宏伟规划的实现，将使我省经济面貌大大改变。
    为了实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正席卷湖南全省。成为一个伟大的全民运动。革新花开遍地，生产捷报频传。从今年年初开始在不到一个月的时间内，全省装卸搬运机械化程度就由5％提高到70％；有将近一半的县以上的煤矿实现从生产到运输一条龙土洋机械化。机械工业方面已经出现了二百七十条自动生产线，一千零六十八条生产流水线；轻工业大抓原材料综合利用，试制了新产品六百零七种。广大职工从大量的手工操作和笨重劳动中解放出来，无不欢天喜地，热情歌颂。例如搬运工人唱道：“过去物资积压多，如今物资自上坡，干起活来轻又快，你看快活不快活。”机械化的结果，大大地提高了劳动生产率，例如衡阳专区十七个煤矿实现了“一条龙”土洋机械化，不仅日产量由原来的六千二百吨提高到一万吨，而且从原来的二万多个劳动力中减少了七千八百多人。技术革新和技术革命运动，不仅在经济上结出了丰硕的果实，广大职工的政治思想和精神面貌也随着发生了巨大的变化，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格大大发扬。工人们唱道：“天高我要攀，地厚我要钻；英雄面前无难事，集体智慧赛神仙。”这是一种多么豪迈的真正“天不怕地不怕”的英雄气概！
    在农业生产方面，首先是农业基本建设以史无前例的规模和速度出现在全省广大农村。自去冬以来，有近七百万人参加水利建设，到今年2月底已经完成十亿土石方。相当于解放十年来全省完成水利土石方总数的40％以上，全省整修和新修水利工程八十八万处，仅农田灌溉就增加蓄水量四十四亿方，将大大提高全省四千三百万亩水稻田的抗旱能力，保证双季稻水田的丰收。新建的十六项发电为主的工程和小型水力发电工程全部安装起来以后，装机容量将达一百零八万瓩。全省一般在小型水库群中建立了大中型主体工程，在主体水库的外围建立了辅助性小型工程，用渠道把主体工程和辅助工程结成一个新型的排灌网，做到塘库相连、长藤结瓜、万水归宗、综合利用，构成一幅改造自然、美化山河的雄伟图画。目前全省八百多条较大河流，已有二百多条按流域规划进行了治理，许多地方已经出现“高山人造海，渠道赛江淮，流水空中过，帆船岭上来”的新气象。随着春耕生产运动的深入，声势浩大的农业技术改造运动正在全省范围内蓬蓬勃勃的开展，并且已经取得了巨大的成绩。全省共创造发明改进各种工具一百多种，推广三百多万件。在技术革新和技术革命方面突出地抓住了机械化和半机械化，以及生产的系列化，搞一条龙、几条龙前后成套。例如衡阳县在这方面就做得很出色，挑选了几百种改得好的农具配套成龙，搞了五条龙：耕作一条龙，畜牧饲料加工一条龙，农副产品加工一条龙，运输工具一条龙，生活工具一条龙。五龙飞舞，生产率很快提高一倍以上。李富春副总理在报告中提出：“在农业机械化方面，我们努力的目标是：从一九五九年起，争取四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决。在十年左右的时间，争取在全国范围内基本上实现农业机械化和水利化，并且实现相当程度的电气化”。按照湖南省当前发展的情况看，我相信一定能够提前实现中央所提出的指标。
    让天公向我们低头，让帝国主义在我们面前发抖
    从湖南，看全国，我对于实现1960年国民经济计划，并且超额完成各项指标，具有绝对的信心。总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝法力无边，毛泽东思想战无不胜。我们要在全国范围内掀起一个学习毛主席著作的高潮，六亿五千万人民高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持三个法宝，是可以战胜任何天灾和人祸。让天公向我们低头，让帝国主义和一切反动派在我们面前发抖吧！
    帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义，曾经利用我国1958年农业生产核实和1959年国民经济计划指标的调整，对我国大肆造谣和诬蔑；当他们不能掩盖我国大跃进的事实，谎言全部破产以后，又制造所谓“中国侵略威胁”的神话，妄图欺骗和恐吓一些不明事理的人们，挑拨离间我们同东南亚各国人民的团结和友谊。事实已经证明而且将继续证明，美帝国主义这种鬼蜮伎俩又是白费气力，作伪心劳。我国同缅甸签订了边界协定和互不侵犯条约之后，最近又同尼泊尔签订了边界协定，这是我国和平外交政策的重大胜利，是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的重大胜利，有力地粉碎了所谓“中国侵略”和“中国扩张”的一切谰言。事实证明，同中国接壤的国家，在边界上不仅不存在任何“中国侵略”的威胁，而且是最安全的和平境界，只要不别具用心和受人利用，历史上所遗留下来的边界问题，完全可以得到合情合理的解决。我们完全拥护我国政府对中印边界问题的方针政策。周恩来总理接受尼赫鲁总理的邀请，访问德里，这个事实的本身，就再一次说明中国人民是珍贵中印两国人民的传统友谊，事事以大局为重，我认为只要印度政府具有同样的愿望和诚意，是不难找到解决问题的合理方案的。我们尊重自己，决不肆口詈骂他国的人。
    谁在坚持侵略的战争政策，谁在坚持和平政策，最雄辩的莫过事实。我国1960年国家预算支出80％以上用于经济和文化建设的开支，国防费所占比重只有8.3％，同这种情况根本相反，美国政府1960年至1961年度预算支出中军费竟占57.1％，正如李先念副总理所指出的：“它充分说明了我国人民从事和平劳动的热烈愿望和节减国防经费加速社会主义建设的坚强决心。同时，这个事实也充分揭穿了美帝国主义假和平、真备战的本来面目。”我国政府同缅甸政府订立互不侵犯条约；美国政府却与日本岸信介政府互相勾结，签订了旨在远东发动新的武装侵略的日美军事同盟，最近更在台湾海峡举行挑衅性的联合军事演习，在十国裁军会议上拒不接受苏联真诚的合理的裁军建议，在拉丁美洲进行种种阴谋颠覆活动，威胁古巴、镇压拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动，在非洲进行阴谋侵略。这一切清楚地告诉我们决不能因为美帝国主义者迫于东风压倒西风的形势，装出一些缓和国际局势的和平姿态，就放松对美帝国主义应有的警惕。我们爱好和平，但是我们也决不害怕战争，我们更不能忘记美帝国主义还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，我们绝对不能容许美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞，伟大的中国人民一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，实现祖国的完全统一。
    各位代表、各位委员，我们以往取得了伟大的成就，正处在一个更为伟大的时代，面临着一个更为伟大的任务。马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，不仅照亮了我国高速度建设社会主义的道路，而且照亮了我们从社会主义过渡到人类最美好的社会——共产主义社会——的道路。我是一个年将八十的老人，在旧中国度过了漫长的岁月，深深以能够在晚年得见社会主义建设成就，能做伟大的新中国的人民一分子而感到无上的幸福和无比的自豪。我今天和六亿五千万人民一道，一心一意跟着共产党走社会主义的道路，明天要跟着共产党愉快地进入共产主义社会。这是莫不心同理同，值得皆大欢喜的。事实上，共产主义的萌芽正在我们伟大祖国的城市和乡村辽阔的土地上放着冲霄的光芒。
