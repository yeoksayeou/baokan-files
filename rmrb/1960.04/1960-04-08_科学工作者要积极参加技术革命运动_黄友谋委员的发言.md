The National Workforce is Vigorously Engaged in Technical Innovation and Revolution

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, China saw the emergence of the unparalleled social organization of the People's Commune in 1958. In 1958 and 1959, the nation's industrial and agricultural production experienced unprecedented consecutive leaps forward, which also drove the unprecedented development of cultural, educational, scientific, and other undertakings. China's socialist construction thus entered a new historical period. As a natural product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and to ensure a more comprehensive, better, and sustained leap forward in China's socialist construction, the Party issued the call to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. This was an extremely wise and timely decision. Currently, workers in various sectors, including industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and capital construction, are engaged in a heated and vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. Thousands upon thousands of workers have become "innovation fanatics," thinking about technical innovation even while walking, eating, and sleeping. Many workers, in order to engage in innovation, are unwilling to leave the workshop for days and nights; some workers, in order to research mechanization and automation, have even disassembled their watches and radios. Thanks to the broad masses of workers who, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a wave of studying Mao Zedong Thought, displaying the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, enormous achievements have been made in the mere two to three months since the movement began. Taking Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City as examples, according to incomplete statistics up to the end of February, since the Spring Festival this year, the province and city have already realized 22 automated and semi-automated factories, 153 automated and semi-automated workshops, 924 automated and semi-automated production lines, 3,659 single automated machines, and 1,977 single semi-automated machines. There are 11,823 items (sets) where manual operations have been transformed into mechanized or semi-mechanized ones, 111 factories and 470 workshops where manual operations have been transformed into mechanized and semi-mechanized ones; in addition, there are 56,623 general innovations. The broad masses of workers, in the great march to conquer technical backwardness, are full of spirit, high in morale, and everyone has made great aspirations. They propose that "every piece of equipment gets a new look, everyone gets a new weapon in hand, everyone orderly engages in innovation, and manual operations go to hell." Wherever "four modernizations" (mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and the utilization of new materials and techniques) are achieved in factories, workshops, work sections, and machine tools, labor productivity has increased by multiples, dozens of times, hundreds of times, or even thousands of times. It seems that the provincial and municipal committees' requirement to basically achieve "four modernizations" in the province and city's factories, mines, transportation, and capital construction sectors before "July 1st" this year is entirely possible to achieve. On a national scale, in just three months this year, the movement has swept across the country, becoming a great national movement. It is not only rapidly changing the face of China's industrial and mining enterprises, but also transforming the face of daily life, such as cooking and washing clothes. The importance of the movement is just as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan," it "will inevitably accelerate the process of China's industrial modernization, agricultural modernization, and scientific and cultural modernization, further increase the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific, technological, and cultural level of the people."

Science and Technology Promote and Influence Each Other; Scientific Workers Should Actively Participate in the Technical Revolution Movement

The relationship between science and technology is close and inseparable; their development promotes and influences each other. Scientific research must be closely integrated with production practice; this is the Party's policy for developing China's scientific undertakings and the correct path for scientific development. Facing such a magnificent and vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, scientific workers all believe that this is a great opportunity for developing scientific undertakings and a time for scientists to display their talents. They all feel very excited and immensely encouraged. At the beginning of last month, scientific and technological workers in Guangzhou City held a grand rally to pledge support for the "four modernizations" movement. The scientific workers and members of scientific research institutions, universities, and specialized societies who attended the meeting enthusiastically responded to the call of the provincial and municipal committees, expressing their desire to participate in the forefront of mechanization and automation. However, some scientific and technological workers' understanding is not entirely consistent with that of the majority. For example, some scientists believe that technical innovation and technical revolution are the business of workers and technicians, and have nothing to do with scientists; others believe that this is the business of industrial and mining enterprises and has little to do with research institutes or universities. Some experts actively support mechanization and automation, but believe that if we are going to do it, we should use foreign equipment, and that using local methods can only produce some simple things, which are not worth their effort. Some express their support for the movement, but believe that they may not be able to solve problems if they go down, and they will lose face, so it is better not to go. Some professors believe that going is necessary, but first, they need to do some research, and then go down when they have a set of methods. Some express their desire to go, but say that their work is too busy and they cannot spare the time; and so on. In a word, they all show an attitude of onlookers or waiting towards the movement. It should be pointed out that technical innovation and technical revolution, like the Great Leap Forward in steel production, are national movements under the banner of the radiant Three Red Banners. No Chinese person should stand outside the movement. Especially scientific workers, because the nature of the movement is related to the innovation and revolution of science and technology, scientific workers should not only participate in the movement to implement the principle of "three combinations" (leadership cadres, technical personnel, and workers); but also, for the development of the scientific cause itself and the transformation of the scientists' own stand, viewpoint, and world outlook, they should actively participate in the movement. Transform technology, transform science, and at the same time transform themselves through the movement.

The Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement Will Inevitably Lead to the Reform of Science, and Will Inevitably Require Scientific Workers to Further Transform Themselves

Vice Premier Li Fuchun correctly pointed out in his report that "the development of technical innovation and technical revolution will inevitably require reforms in some aspects of the superstructure and the relations of production to adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces." Therefore, in order to enable our science to keep up with the requirements of the situation and adapt to the development of productive forces, whether scientists are willing or not, science must inevitably be reformed. Otherwise, science and scientists will be abandoned by the situation. Today's natural sciences and technical sciences, whether in theory or in research methods and experimental techniques, have many outdated things. And they are distorted by idealism to varying degrees, covered with a layer of bourgeois dust. First of all, taking scientific theory as an example, no matter which theory in which science, it is nothing more than a reflection of objective reality. Because it is a "reflection," an "image," it is destined to be incomplete and have shortcomings, so it must be constantly checked and transformed through the test of practice, and sometimes it must be revolutionized. However, because many of the concepts, thought methods, research methods, and experimental techniques currently used in science have not yet broken away from the old ways of capitalism or even feudalism, many scientific theoretical work encounters difficult problems to overcome. For example, the theory of elementary particles in physics is one prominent example. Secondly, in terms of research methods and experimental techniques, the development of new technologies such as electronic computers, ultrasonic waves, and radioactive isotopes is bringing about revolutionary changes. However, because old ideas, old methods, old traditions, old literature, and old equipment are deeply rooted in the field of science and the minds of scientists, these new technologies cannot be fully utilized. Examples of this can be said to be everywhere, and the most prominent is probably mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and other so-called basic sciences with a long history. This is the current situation of natural science. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will be detrimental to the development of science. As for applying these outdated things in science to China's socialist construction, we must stand on the correct viewpoint and use a critical attitude to use them in order to exert their due role. Conversely, if we regard them as golden rules, do not check them in practice, and even cannot see new things and despise the production practice and scientific practice of the broad masses, then they will become shackles on our thoughts, obstacles in the Great Leap Forward, and stumbling blocks to climbing the peak of science. Since the Great Leap Forward, most of the many achievements in technological reforms in industrial and agricultural production and in scientific research in our country have come from the hands of young people and workers and peasants. Why? This is precisely because they have fewer of these dead burdens in their minds, can faithfully listen to the Party, resolutely follow the mass line, establish lofty aspirations, and arm their minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and take it as the highest criterion for guiding technological reforms and scientific research. Therefore, they can overcome difficulties in a short period of time, use methods that old experts did not expect, and achieve results that old experts did not dare to imagine. Therefore, I deeply feel that what Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, that "ordinary laborers with practical production experience can even better reform old technologies and create new technologies," is a sentence worth pondering by every scientific worker.

From this, we can realize that the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will inevitably lead to the reform of science, and will inevitably require scientific workers to further transform their stand, viewpoint, and world outlook. Countless facts in the past have proven that the most effective ways to transform thinking are, first, theoretical study, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works; and second, practical training, especially participation in various movements of class struggle or struggle against nature. The current upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement across the country are the best combination of these two, an important part of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and also the key to China's climb to the peak of world science. Comrades, let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement!

    科学工作者要积极参加技术革命运动
    黄友谋委员的发言
    全国职工正大闹技术革新和技术革命
    在党建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国在1958年产生了人民公社这一优越无比的社会组织，在1958年和1959年全国的工农业生产出现了史无前例的连续大跃进，同时又带动了文教科学等各项事业的空前发展。我国的社会主义建设从而进入了一个新的历史时期。作为总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物，同时为了保证我国社会主义建设更全面、更好的持续跃进，党提出了大搞技术革新和技术革命的号召，这是极其英明而适时的。现在，全国的工矿企业、交通运输、基本建设等各条战线的职工群众，正以冲天的革命干劲，热火朝天地大闹技术革新和技术革命。成千上万的工人都成为“革新迷”，连走路、吃饭、睡觉也想着技术革新。许多工人为了要搞革新，几日夜都不愿离开车间；有的工人为了要研究机械化、自动化，把自己的手表和收音机也拆掉了。由于广大的职工群众在党的领导下展开了学习毛泽东思想的热潮，发挥了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，运动开展以来仅仅两三个月的时间便取得了巨大的成绩。拿广东省和广州市来说，根据到2月底止的不完全统计，自从今年春节以来，全省市已经实现自动化和半自动化工厂二十二个，自动化和半自动化车间一百五十三个，自动化和半自动化的生产线九百二十四条，单机自动化三千六百五十九台，单机半自动化一千九百七十七台；变手工操作为机械化半机械化一万一千八百二十三项（台），手工操作变机械化和半机械化的工厂一百一十一个，车间四百七十个；此外，还有一般革新五万六千六百二十三项。广大的职工群众在征服技术落后的伟大进军中，意气风发，斗志昂扬，个个立下雄心壮志。他们提出“台台设备换新装，个个手上拿新枪，人人序序搞革新，手工操作见阎王”。凡是实现“四化”的工矿、车间、工段和机床，劳动生产率便成倍、几十倍、几百倍甚至于几千倍地增长。看来，省市委提出在今年“七一”以前要在全省市的厂矿、交通运输和基本建设等方面基本上实现“四化”的要求，是完全可能达到的。在全国的范围来说，今年以来，在仅仅三个月的时间里，运动已经席卷全国，成为一个伟大的全民运动，它不仅在迅速地改变着我国工矿企业的面貌，而且正在变革着日常生活的面貌，如做饭、洗衣服等等。运动的重要性正如李富春副总理在“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”中所说，“必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平”。
    科学和技术是互相推动互相影响的，科学工作者们应积极投入技术革命运动中去
    科学和技术的关系是密切不可分割的，它们的发展是互相推动、互相影响的。科学研究必须密切结合生产实际，这是党发展我国科学事业的方针，也是科学发展的正确途径。科学工作者面对着这样一个波澜壮阔、气势澎湃的技术革新和技术革命运动，皆认为这是发展科学事业的大好形势，也是科学家大显身手的时候，都感觉到十分的兴奋和受到无比的鼓舞。广州市的科学技术工作者在上个月初曾举行盛大的支援“四化”运动誓师大会，与会的科学研究机关、高等学校和专门学会的科学工作者和成员都热烈响应省市委的号召，表示要参加到机械化自动化的最前线去。但是，也有部分的科学技术工作者，他们的认识和大多数人的认识并不完全一致的。比如，有些科学家认为技术革新和技术革命是工人和技术人员的事，和科学家无关；有的又认为这是工矿企业部门的事，和研究所或高等学校关系不大。有些专家积极支持搞机械化、自动化，但认为要搞便要用洋设备，用土办法只能搞一些简单的东西，不值得自己去搞；有的对运动表示拥护，但认为自己下去不一定能解决问题，那时面子不好过，不如不去。有的教授认为去是要去，不过先要作一番研究，等有了一套办法时再下去；有的表示想去，但又说本岗位工作忙不过来，抽不出时间去；等等。一句话，他们对运动都表现出旁观或等待的态度。应该指出，技术革新和技术革命和大炼钢铁一样，是在光芒万丈三面红旗招展下的全民运动，任何一个中国人民都不应置身于运动之外的。特别是科学工作者，由于运动的性质是关系到科学技术的革新和革命，科学工作者不但为了贯彻运动的三结合方针要参加到运动中去；就是为了科学事业本身的发展和科学家自己的立场、观点和世界观的改造，也应该积极地投身到运动中去。通过运动来改造技术、改造科学，同时也改造自己。
    技术革新和技术革命运动必然导致科学的改革，必然要求科学工作者进一步自我改造
    李富春副总理在报告中正确地指出，“技术革新和技术革命的发展，势必要求上层建筑和生产关系的某些方面也要进行改革，来适应生产力发展的需要。”所以，为了使我们的科学能够跟上形势的要求，适应生产力的发展，不管科学家愿意不愿意，必然地要求科学也要进行改革。不然，科学和科学家便会给形势所抛弃。今天的自然科学和技术科学，不管在理论上或研究方法和实验技术上，都有不少陈腐过时的东西。并且它们还不同程度地受到唯心主义的歪曲，蒙上了一层资产阶级的灰尘。首先，拿科学上的理论来说，不管哪一门科学的哪一个理论，都不外是客观现实的反映。因为它是“反映”、是“影像”，它注定是不全面的，有缺点的，因此必须通过实践的考验来不断检查和改造，有时还要加以革命。但是，由于现在科学上所使用的概念、思想方法、研究方法和实验技术等，许多都还没有摆脱资本主义甚至于封建主义时代的老一套，以致许多科学理论工作碰到难于克服的困难。譬如，物理学上基本粒子的理论便是其中一个突出的例子。其次，在研究方法和实验技术方面，由于像电子计算机、超声波、放射性同位素等新技术的发展，正带来革命性的变革。但是，由于旧思想、旧方法、旧传统、旧文献、旧设备等已根深蒂固地盘据着科学领域和科学家的头脑，所以这些新技术也得不到充分的利用。关于这方面的例子可以说到处皆是，而其中最突出的恐怕要推数学、物理、化学、生物等历史较悠久的所谓基础科学。这是目前自然科学所处的情况。这种情况如不迅速加以改变，对于科学的发展是不利的。至于把科学上这些陈腐过时的东西应用到我国的社会主义建设上时，更要站在正确的观点，用批判的态度来运用，才能发挥它们应有作用。反过来，如果把它们奉为金科玉律，不从实践中加以检查，甚至因而看不见新生事物，轻视广大群众的生产实践和科学实践，那它们就会成为我们思想上的枷锁，大跃进中的障碍，攀登科学高峰的绊脚石。大跃进以来，我国工农业生产上的技术改革和科学研究上所取得许许多多成就中，多数出之于青年人和工农群众之手。为什么？这正是因为他们思想上少这些死包袱，能够忠实听党的话，坚决走群众路线，树雄心，立大志，把无往不胜攻无不克的毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，并把它作为指导技术改革和科学研究的最高准绳。所以他们能够在短时间里，攻破难关，用老专家所预想不到的方法，取得老专家所不敢想像的成绩。因此，我深深感到李富春副总理在报告中所说的，“有生产实践经验的普通劳动者也可以甚至更可以改革旧技术和创造新技术”是值得每一个科学工作者深省的一句话。
    从这里我们可以体会到，技术革新和技术革命运动发展的结果，必然地要导致科学的改革，同时也必然地要求科学工作者立场、观点和世界观进一步的改造。过去无数的事实证明，思想改造最有效的办法一是理论学习，特别是毛主席著作的学习；一是实际锻炼，特别是投身到阶级斗争或向自然界斗争的各种运动中的锻炼。目前在全国范围内开展的学习毛泽东思想的热潮和技术革新、技术革命运动，正是这两者最好的结合，是党建设社会主义总路线的重要内容，也是我国攀登世界科学高峰的关键。同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，积极参加到技术革新和技术革命运动中去吧！
