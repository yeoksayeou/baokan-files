Xinhua News Agency, April 18th—Tran Trong Quat, Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, held a press conference this afternoon, strongly condemning the agreement reached between the U.S. government and the South Vietnamese regime to increase military personnel in the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, calling it a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords and an intensification of war preparations.

Tran Trong Quat said that the U.S. interventionists, in defiance of the guarantees made by their representatives at the Geneva Conference on Indochina, are attempting to use the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" as a tool for the long-term division of Vietnam, in order to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base in Southeast Asia.

Tran Trong Quat said that now, the U.S. government and the South Vietnamese authorities have openly and formally requested the International Commission to allow the U.S. to increase the military personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, which is a very serious matter. The conspiracy of the U.S. and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is to attempt to legitimize the existence of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" by means of open reinforcements, so as to cover up its war preparations and to inflict further persecution on the people of South Vietnam who love their country, love peace, and support the Geneva Accords. What is even more dangerous is the attempt to transport U.S. troops into South Vietnam when needed. Undoubtedly, doing so will lead to a more tense situation in South Vietnam and will bring serious consequences to peace and security in Southeast Asia and the Far East.

Tran Trong Quat said that in the face of this serious situation, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are resolutely fighting against all conspiracies and crimes of the U.S. interventionists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique; resolutely fighting for the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords, for the reunification of Vietnam, and for the defense of world peace.

Tran Trong Quat concluded by saying that we hope that all organizations and peace-loving people in the world will continue to sympathize with and support the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people, and resolutely stop the U.S. imperialist policy of challenge and intervention in Vietnam. At present, it is necessary to demand the dissolution and expulsion of all U.S. military delegations in South Vietnam, and to demand that the Geneva Accords be respected and strictly implemented.

    谴责美国破坏日内瓦协议
    据新华社18日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办陈仲括今天下午举行记者招待会，严厉谴责美国政府和越南南方政权就增加在越南南方的“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员达成协议，是粗暴地破坏日内瓦协议，加紧备战的行为。
    陈仲括说，美国干涉者违背了他们的代表在关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议上作过的保证，企图把“美国军事援助顾问团”作为长期分割越南的工具，以便把越南南方变成美国在东南亚的殖民地和军事基地。
    陈仲括说，现在，美国政府和越南南方当局竟公然正式向国际委员会要求让美国增加在越南南方的“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员，这是一个非常严重的问题。美国和吴庭艳政权的阴谋是企图利用公开增援，使“美国军事援助顾问团”的存在成为合法化，借以掩盖它的备战活动，并对越南南方热爱祖国、热爱和平和赞成日内瓦协议的人们施以更进一步的迫害。更危险的是，在需要的时候，企图把美国军队运进越南南方。无疑地这样做一定会导致南越局势更紧张，并将给东南亚和远东和平与安全带来严重后果。
    陈仲括说，面对着这种严重的局势，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府正在为反对美国干涉者和吴庭艳集团的一切阴谋和罪行而坚持斗争；为严格地履行日内瓦协议，为越南的统一和捍卫世界和平而坚持斗争。
    陈仲括最后说，我们希望世界上一切团体和爱好和平的人们，继续同情和支持南越人民的正义斗争，并坚决制止美帝国主义在越南的挑战和干涉政策，当前是要求解散和驱逐美国在南越的各种军事性代表团，并要求必须尊重和严格地履行日内瓦协议。
