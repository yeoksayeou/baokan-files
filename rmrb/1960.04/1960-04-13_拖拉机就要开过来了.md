    The small road traversed for thousands of years,
    Is being widened this year;
    The terraced fields cultivated for thousands of years,
    Are being leveled this year.
    Why are they being widened,
    Why are they being leveled,
    Because the tractor is coming!
    Because mechanization is about to be realized.
    Young lads,
    Carry loads as if carrying two mountains;
    Beautiful girls,
    Their singing voices rivaling zither strings.
    Why are they so full of energy,
    Why do their hearts feel so sweet,
    Because the tractor is coming!
    Because mechanization is about to be realized.
    The small road traversed for thousands of years,
    Is being widened this year;
    The terraced fields cultivated for thousands of years,
    Are being leveled this year.
    Why are they being widened,
    Why are they being leveled,
    Because we are marching towards socialism!
    Because we are building a happy home!
    Come on! The willow branches haven't turned green in the rice transplanting season,
    And the rice seedlings haven't been planted in the mud.
    The girls are busy practicing transplanting rice,
    Gathering pine needles for practice.
    Every year transplanting rice with both hands,
    This year transplanting rice with machines.
    Every year planting seedlings one by one,
    This year pushing rows and rows.
    Spring water ripples with silver,
    Spring breeze caresses the face,
    The rice transplanter rolls on,
    Spreading a green blanket on the ground.
    Practicing from morning till night,
    Not returning even when the moon rises.
    They have already learned it well,
    Completely fascinated.
    Come on, come on!
    The rice transplanting season;
    Come on, come on!
    Don't let people wait anxiously...

    拖拉机就要开过来了	未央
    走了千年的小路，
    今年来加宽；
    种了千年的梯田，
    今年整平坦。
    为什么来加宽，
    为什么整平坦，
    因为拖拉机就要开过来了！
    因为机械化就要实现。
    年青的小伙子，
    一担两座山；
    美丽的姑娘们，
    歌喉赛琴弦。
    为什么干劲冲天，
    为什么心似蜜甜，
    因为拖拉机就要开过来了！
    因为机械化就要实现。
    走了千年的小路，
    今年来加宽；
    种了千年的梯田，
    今年整平坦。
    为什么来加宽，
    为什么整平坦，
    因为要走向社会主义！
    因为要修建幸福家园！
    来吧！插秧的季节柳条没发绿，
    种谷没下泥。
    姑娘们忙着练插秧，
    采来松针作练习。
    年年插秧用双手，
    今年插秧使机器。
    年年插秧蔸蔸栽，
    今年插秧垅垅推。
    春水泛银波，
    春风拂面吹，
    插秧机滚滚过，
    一床绿毯铺在地。
    从早练到晚，
    月亮起来还不归。
    早已学好了啊，
    心里着了迷。
    来吧，来吧！
    插秧的季节；
    来吧，来吧！
    莫叫人等得心碎……
