    Lighthouse Commune Makes Full Use of Water Power
    Centered on Hydroelectric Power Stations, Initially Builds Hydraulic Processing Network, Mechanical Manufacturing and Repair Network, and Water Conservancy Gravity Irrigation Network
    (Our report) According to the characteristics of mountainous areas, the Lighthouse Commune in Enshi County, Hubei Province, has vigorously launched mass movements and initially built a hydraulic processing network, a mechanical manufacturing and repair network, and a water conservancy gravity irrigation network centered on hydroelectric power stations, fundamentally changing the backwardness of the mountainous area.
    The Lighthouse Commune has built eleven hydroelectric power stations (seven already generating electricity) on nine mountain gullies and rivers, four turbine stations, and one thermal power station. All eight management areas of the commune have power stations, with a current power generation capacity of 155 kilowatts. The commune also plans to continue building twenty-six hydroelectric power stations, which will increase power generation to 460 kilowatts.
    The use of water power has promoted the rapid development of commune-run industries. The entire commune has 59 sets of indigenous and foreign processing machinery for grain, oil, and other materials installed in eight management areas, as well as 85 tea rolling machines, basically realizing mechanization or semi-mechanization of the processing of major products such as grain, oil, and tea throughout the commune.
    With the development of agricultural production and the full use of hydroelectric power, this commune has initially built an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing network centered on the commune-run farm tool machinery factory. The eight factories and six stations run by the commune have 28 indigenous and foreign lathes, 38 generators and motors, and more than 50 other machines. Some of the main processes in some factories have been replaced by power instead of manual operation, basically achieving mechanization. Each management area has a small farm tool manufacturing and repair factory, equipped with simple tools such as vises, grinders, drills, and hand-operated screw machines, which can produce and repair seeders, improved plows, and man-powered and animal-drawn carts. The development and growth of the commune's farm tool machinery repair and manufacturing network has laid the foundation for agricultural technical innovation at high speed. Last year, the entire commune manufactured more than 140,000 pieces of various farm tools, 1,650 human-powered and animal-drawn carts, and 32 wooden boats.
    This year, the entire commune plans to establish 18 pumping stations (four already installed) so that 14,000 mu of paddy fields can all achieve pumped gravity irrigation on the basis of having half of them already under gravity irrigation.

    灯塔公社充分利用水动力
    以水电站为中心，初步建成水力加工网、机械制造修配网、水利自流灌溉网
    本报讯　湖北恩施县灯塔公社根据山区特点，大搞群众运动，初步建成了以水电动力站为中心的水力加工网、机械制造修配网、水利自流灌溉网，基本上改变了山区落后面貌。
    灯塔公社在九条山沟、河流上已建成水力发电站十一个（七个已发电），水轮机站四个，火力发电站一个。公社的八个管理区都有了发电站，现有发电量达一百五十五瓩。全社还计划继续兴办二十六个水电站，发电量将增加到四百六十瓩。
    水力的利用推动了社办工业的迅速发展，全公社已有八个管理区安装粮食、油料等土洋加工机械五十九部，揉茶机八十五部，使全社粮、油、茶等主要产品加工基本实现了机械化或半机械化。
    随着农业生产的发展和水电动力的充分利用，这个公社初步建成了以社办农具机械厂为核心的农业机械修配网。社办的八厂六站已有土洋车床二十八台，发电机和电动机三十八台，其他机器五十多部。有些厂的几项主要工序已由动力代替了手工操作，基本实现了机械化。各个管理区都有一个小型农具制造修配厂，配有老虎钳、砂轮、钻机和手摇螺丝机等简单机具，可以生产和修配条播器、改良犁和人、畜拉车等。公社农具机械修配网的发展壮大，为高速度进行农业技术革新打下了基础。去年全社共制造各种农具十四万多件，制造人力、畜力车一千六百五十部，木船三十二只。
    全社今年计划建立抽水站十八处（已安装四处）使一万四千亩水田，在已有半数自流灌溉的基础上，全部实现提水自流灌溉。
