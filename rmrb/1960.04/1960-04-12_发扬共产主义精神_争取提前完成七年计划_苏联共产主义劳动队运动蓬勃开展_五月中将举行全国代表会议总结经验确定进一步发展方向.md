Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th: The National Congress of Soviet Communist Labor Brigades and Communist Labor Shock Workers will be held in May. This was stated to this reporter by Karpinsky, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, in a recent conversation.

He said that since the movement to win the title of Communist Labor Brigade began in October 1958, this movement has been vigorously developing throughout the Soviet Union for nearly a year and a half. As of January this year, 200,000 work teams and labor collectives across the country had participated in the movement to strive to become Communist Labor Brigades and Communist Labor Collectives. Three million people have participated in this movement. Now 12,000 work teams and collectives have won the glorious title of Communist Labor Brigade and Communist Labor Collective.

Karpinsky said that the National Congress of All-Union Communist Labor Brigades and Communist Labor Shock Workers will summarize the achievements of the movement's development over the past year, exchange advanced experiences of Communist Labor Brigades from various regions, and discuss and determine the direction of further development of the movement.

Karpinsky said that the congress will be jointly convened by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League. Currently, the Soviet Union's various republics and states are holding local congresses of Communist Labor Brigades and Communist Labor Shock Workers.

According to Soviet newspaper reports, representative meetings of Soviet Communist Labor Brigades and Communist Labor Shock Workers have already been held in the capitals of the two republics of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. At the representative meeting held in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, Kazhanets, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, gave a high evaluation of the movement to strive to become a Communist Labor Brigade.

Kazhanets pointed out at the meeting that this communist-spirited competition movement has gathered all the good aspects of the millions of socialist labor competition participants since the establishment of the Soviet regime, and organically combined labor and education. He said that in the Communist Labor Brigade and the Communist Labor Shock Workers, people can see their own learning models, that is, a high degree of consciousness in labor, a high degree of activeness in social life, and a strong desire to master cultural and technical knowledge. He called on the participants of the meeting to carry out this movement more deeply and more widely, and concentrate all their efforts to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    发扬共产主义精神　争取提前完成七年计划
    苏联共产主义劳动队运动蓬勃开展
    五月中将举行全国代表会议总结经验确定进一步发展方向
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手全国代表会议将在5月中举行。这是苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记卡尔平斯基最近在一次谈话中向本社记者说的。
    他说，自从1958年10月争取共产主义劳动队称号的运动开始以来，在这近一年半的时间内，这一运动已经在苏联全国范围内蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。到今年1月为止，全国已经有二十万个工作队和劳动集体参加了争取做共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动集体的运动。已有三百万人参加这个运动。现在有一万二千个工作队和集体已经得到了共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动集体的光荣称号。
    卡尔平斯基说，全苏共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手全国代表会议将总结一年多以来运动发展的成绩，交流各地共产主义劳动队的先进经验，并讨论和确定运动进一步发展的方向。
    卡尔平斯基说，这次代表会议将由苏联工会中央理事会和苏联共青团中央委员会联合召开。目前苏联各加盟共和国和各州纷纷召开地方性的共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手代表会议。
    据苏联报纸报道，苏联共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手的代表会议已经在乌克兰和哈萨克两个共和国的首都召开。在乌克兰首都基辅召开的代表会议上，乌克兰共产党中央书记卡扎涅次对争取做共产主义劳动队的运动给予了很高的评价。
    卡扎涅次曾在会上指出，在这项充满共产主义精神的竞赛运动中聚集了苏维埃政权成立以来千百万社会主义劳动竞赛参加者一切好的方面，并且把劳动和教育有机地结合了起来，他说，在共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手的身上人们可以看到自己学习的榜样，这就是劳动中的高度的自觉性，社会生活中高度的积极性和掌握文化、技术知识的强烈愿望。他号召会议的参加者更深入更广泛地开展这个运动，集中全力争取提前完成七年计划。
