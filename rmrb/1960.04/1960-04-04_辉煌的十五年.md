    Glorious Fifteen Years
    Liu Changsheng
    Today is the great festival of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary. We join the Hungarian brothers in warmly celebrating their Liberation Day and rejoice in the glorious achievements they have made in the past fifteen years.
    In the spring of 1945, the German fascist bandits who trampled on Hungarian soil were completely driven out by the Soviet army. The Hungarian working people were thus freed from centuries of feudal oppression and Horthy's twenty-five years of fascist terror rule, became masters of the country, gained national independence and freedom, and embarked on the socialist road. In the short span of fifteen years, earth-shaking changes have taken place on Hungarian soil. Hungary has leapt from a backward agricultural country to a socialist country with developed industry.
    Before liberation, the Hungarian people were in dire straits under the rule of the Horthy fascists. They not only had no political rights, but also lived in abject poverty. Hungary, with a population of nearly ten million, was even known as the "country of three million beggars." More than half of the country's land was held by landlords and rich peasants; major industries were controlled by foreign capital. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communists, the Hungarian working people eliminated feudal remnants between 1945 and 1948, carried out land reform, and nationalized factories, transportation, banks, and large businesses, thereby eradicating the soil for all exploitation of man by man. While carrying out this sharp class struggle, the Hungarian Communists also led the people to vigorously restore the national economy, which had been severely damaged by the war. By 1949, the production level of all sectors of the Hungarian national economy had reached and exceeded the highest pre-war level of 1938.
    In 1950, Hungary began to implement its first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and launched the work of socialist industrialization. In just ten years, the Hungarian people have built more than 100 large-scale enterprises. At the same time, new industrial cities have sprung up on Hungarian soil. At present, Hungary's industrial production accounts for 54% to 55% of the national income, and if the construction industry is included, it exceeds 60%; the total industrial output value of the country has reached more than four times that of 1938 before the war. The national income has doubled in the past ten years, and the living standards of the people have also increased by 50%.
    In October 1956, imperialism and Hungarian reactionary forces colluded with each other and, under the cover of the Nagy Imre counter-revolutionary clique, launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to restore capitalism and the fascist system in Hungary. In these dark days, thousands of Communists and progressives were brutally murdered, and Hungary's socialist cause suffered severe damage. However, the Hungarian people with a glorious revolutionary tradition were not intimidated by the white terror, and they bravely fought against the enemy and defended their revolutionary achievements. Under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, with the help of the Soviet people and the support of the entire socialist camp, they quickly repelled the frenzied attack of the counter-revolution and shattered the imperialist conspiracy to pull Hungary out of the socialist camp. The Hungarian people have been tempered in this sharp struggle against the counter-revolution and have gained experience and lessons. They are more united, and their pace towards socialism is more firm and powerful. In the short period of just over three years after the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quelled, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people rapidly healed the wounds caused by the counter-revolutionary events and established new and more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction.
    In the past three years or so, Hungary's socialist transformation of agriculture, socialist economic construction, and ideological and cultural revolution have all undergone rapid and profound development.
    In the past year, Hungary has achieved great victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The counter-revolutionary riots of 1956 almost collapsed two-thirds of Hungary's agricultural cooperatives. The cultivated area of the cooperatives suddenly dropped from more than 20% of the country to only about 8%. However, after the riots were quelled, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and insisted on the road of socialist transformation of agriculture. To this end, it adopted many effective measures, formulated a series of correct policies, and vigorously carried out propaganda and education and persuasion work for farmers, guiding them step by step onto the road of collectivization. In this way, in the spring of last year and this year, the socialist transformation movement in agriculture successively appeared in a high tide, and farmers in entire villages and entire regions embarked on the road of collectivization, and the number of agricultural cooperatives increased rapidly. Up to now, 74% of the country's villages and towns have been collectivized. The cultivated area of ​​cooperatives and state farms has accounted for more than 71.3% of the country, and socialist components have occupied an overwhelming advantage in agriculture. This great victory has accelerated the development of Hungary's socialist cause. Comrade Kadar pointed out that the socialist transformation of Hungary's agriculture should be completed in a few years, so as to lay the foundation of socialism in Hungary.
    Hungary's socialist economic construction has also achieved brilliant achievements in the past three years. The major losses of more than 20 billion forints caused by the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the ideological confusion caused among workers have all become historical relics in just three years. By the end of 1957, Hungary's industrial production level had exceeded the level of 1955, and from 1958, it began to implement a three-year plan for the development of the national economy. The Hungarian working people responded to the call of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to complete the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule, enthusiastically launched a socialist competition and a movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and successfully completed the main indicators of the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule. Compared with 1957, Hungary's industrial production increased by 24% in 1959, and agricultural production increased by 13%. Most crops achieved bumper harvests.
    On the ideological front, the Hungarian people have also achieved outstanding achievements. As everyone knows, revisionist thought once flooded in the Hungarian intellectual circles. Revisionists promoted bourgeois nationalism and prepared a hotbed for counter-revolutionary events. After the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quelled, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party firmly launched a merciless criticism of revisionist ideas and clarified the ideological confusion caused by the counter-revolutionary riots. The Party Central Committee issued a series of important documents on education policy, on literary issues, on populist writers, and on nationalism, giving people powerful ideological weapons for struggle. In the short period of just over three years, many intellectuals, encouraged by the Party, went to the countryside and factories to get in touch with reality, and the enthusiasm of workers to build socialism and the vivid facts of farmers embarking on the road of collectivization also promoted the progress of intellectuals.
    At the end of November last year, the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party summarized the achievements of Hungary's socialist construction in the past fifteen years, especially the achievements and experiences gained in the past three years after the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and put forward the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy (1961-1965). The main task of this new five-year plan is to complete the foundation work of socialism and accelerate the construction of socialism. By 1965, the total industrial output should be increased by at least 65% to 70% compared with 1958, and agriculture should be increased by 30% to 32%; at the same time, the growth rate of the means of production should be greater than the growth rate of consumer goods to accelerate the process of socialist industrialization. It is estimated that by 1965, the total industrial output will be about six times higher than before liberation. The Hungarian people warmly welcomed this plan and are determined to accelerate their progress this year in order to lay a good foundation for the second five-year plan, and at the same time celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of liberation with outstanding achievements. This year, the state's basic construction investment is also larger than any previous year, and the agricultural investment is increased by 27% compared with last year, half of which will be used to develop the cause of agricultural mechanization.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Hungarian people have launched a magnificent labor competition to welcome the 15th anniversary of the motherland's liberation. Many enterprises have broken the past conventions and greatly increased production in the first quarter. 39,000 labor teams in the national industrial and transportation sectors have formulated competition goals for increasing production and practicing economy this year. With the deepening of the production competition, the technical innovation movement is also developing day by day. Enterprises under the metallurgical and machinery manufacturing departments alone have decided to save the country a value of 810 million forints through technical innovation this year. The staff and workers also carried forward the communist style in the competition process and widely launched a mutual assistance and cooperation movement. And the farmers who have embarked on the road of collectivization are also welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of liberation with unprecedented enthusiasm, and even some newly established cooperatives are challenging each other, with the goal of providing more livestock products to the country as a competition goal. Tractor drivers are working day and night in three shifts to complete the spring plowing and sowing work in a timely manner. At present, the Hungarian people are carrying out enthusiastic labor and accelerating the construction of socialism.
    While achieving brilliant achievements in socialist construction, the Hungarian people, together with the socialist brother countries, have made significant contributions to continuously strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to maintaining peace in Europe and the world. All these have further strengthened the strength of the entire socialist camp and the strength of world peace. Our people regard every achievement of the Hungarian people as an achievement of our common cause. We cheer for these glorious achievements of the Hungarian people!
    Over the past ten years, the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has developed greatly, and the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Hungary in the political, economic, and cultural fields has been strengthened day by day. In the spring of 1959, China and Hungary signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, which further strengthened the friendly relations between our two countries. In my country's socialist construction, the Hungarian people assist us with machinery and equipment and superb technology. The high degree of internationalism of Hungarian experts working in our country encourages the people of our country who are building socialism. We firmly believe that the unity of the Chinese and Hungarian people, based on common ideas and common goals, and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will surely be continuously consolidated.
    On the glorious liberation festival of the Hungarian people, we pay our highest respect to the fraternal Hungarian people and warmly congratulate the Hungarian people on the glorious victories they have achieved in socialist construction in the past fifteen years!

    辉煌的十五年
    刘长胜
    今天是匈牙利解放十五周年的伟大节日。我们同匈牙利兄弟一道热烈庆祝他们的解放日，为他们在十五年中所取得的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    1945年春天，践踏着匈牙利国土的德国法西斯匪帮被苏联军队全部赶出去。匈牙利劳动人民从此摆脱了几世纪以来的封建压迫和霍尔蒂二十五年的法西斯恐怖统治，成了国家的主人，获得了民族独立和自由，走上了社会主义道路。在短短的十五年间，匈牙利土地上发生了翻天复地的变化。匈牙利已由落后的农业国一跃而成为工业发达的社会主义国家。
    解放前，匈牙利人民在霍尔蒂法西斯统治下处在水深火热之中，不但政治上毫无权利，生活也穷困不堪。拥有近一千万居民的匈牙利竟被称为“三百万乞丐的国家”。全国土地有一半以上握在地主富农手里；主要的工业都受外国资本的控制。解放后，匈牙利劳动人民在共产党人的领导下，在1945—1948年间，消灭了封建残余，进行了土地改革，把工厂、交通、银行和大商业都收归国有，从而铲除了一切人剥削人的土壤。在进行这场尖锐的阶级斗争的时候，匈牙利共产党人还领导人民大力进行了遭受战争严重破坏的国民经济的恢复工作。到1949年，匈牙利国民经济各部门的生产水平，就已经达到并超过了战前1938年的最高水平。
    1950年匈牙利开始执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，展开了社会主义工业化的工作。至今不过十年，匈牙利人民已兴建了一百多项大型企业，同时，匈牙利土地上也出现了一座座新的工业城市。现在，匈牙利的工业生产在国民收入中所占的比重已达54％到55％，如果把建筑业包括在内，则已超过60％；全国工业总产值已达到战前1938年的四倍以上。国民收入在这十年间增加了一倍，人民的生活水平也提高了50％。
    1956年10月，帝国主义和匈牙利的反动势力互相勾结，在纳吉·伊姆雷反革命集团的掩护下，发动了武装叛乱，企图使资本主义和法西斯制度在匈牙利复辟。在这乌云密布的日子里，千百个共产党人和进步人士遭到了残酷的屠杀，匈牙利的社会主义事业遭到了严重的破坏。然而，具有光荣的革命传统的匈牙利人民并没有被白色恐怖吓倒，他们英勇地同敌人进行了斗争，捍卫了自己的革命果实。他们在社会主义工人党领导下，在苏联人民的帮助下和整个社会主义阵营的支持下，迅速打退了反革命的猖狂进攻，粉碎了帝国主义妄图把匈牙利拉出社会主义阵营的阴谋。匈牙利人民在同反革命进行的这场尖锐斗争中受到了锻炼，取得了经验教训，他们团结得更紧，向社会主义迈进的步伐更坚定有力了。在反革命叛乱被平息后仅仅三年多的时间内，匈牙利人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，迅速地医好了反革命事件带来的创伤，并且在社会主义建设事业上立下了新的更光辉的业绩。
    最近三年多以来，匈牙利的农业社会主义改造、社会主义经济建设和思想文化革命都有了迅速而深刻的发展。
    一年以来，匈牙利在农业社会主义改造方面取得了伟大的胜利。1956年的反革命暴乱几乎把匈牙利的农业合作社搞垮了三分之二。合作社的耕地面积从占全国20％以上骤然下降到只占8％左右。但是暴乱被平息后，匈牙利社会主义工人党坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，坚持对农业进行社会主义改造的道路，为此采取了许多有效措施，制定了一系列正确的政策，并且大力展开了对农民的宣传教育和说服工作，引导他们一步步走上合作化的道路。这样，在去年和今年两个春季，农业的社会主义改造运动接连出现了高潮，整村整区的农民走上集体化道路，农业合作社的数量迅速增长。到现在为止，全国已有74％的村镇都已合作化了。合作社连同国营农场的耕地面积已占全国71.3％以上，社会主义成分已在农业中占了压倒优势。这一伟大胜利，加速了匈牙利社会主义事业的发展。卡达尔同志指出：要在几年内完成匈牙利的农业社会主义改造，从而在匈牙利奠定社会主义的基础。
    匈牙利的社会主义经济建设，三年多来也取得了灿烂的成就。反革命叛乱造成的达二百亿多福林的重大损失和在工人中间造成的思想混乱，在短短的三年中都已成为历史陈迹了。1957年底，匈牙利的工业生产水平就已超过了1955年的水平，从1958年起，开始实行发展国民经济的三年计划。匈牙利劳动人民响应匈牙利社会主义工人党发出的提前一年完成三年计划的号召，热烈展开社会主义竞赛和争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动，胜利地提前一年完成了三年计划的主要指标。与1957年相比，1959年匈牙利的工业生产增加了24％，农业生产增加了13％，绝大多数农作物都获得了大丰收。
    在思想战线上，匈牙利人民也获得了出色的成就。大家知道，在匈牙利的知识界，修正主义思潮曾一度泛滥。修正主义者宣传资产阶级的民族主义，曾为反革命事件准备了温床。反革命叛乱平息后，匈牙利社会主义工人党坚定地对修正主义思想展开了无情的批判，澄清了反革命暴乱造成的思想混乱。党中央发表了关于教育政策的方针、关于文学问题、关于民粹派作家和关于民族主义问题等一系列重要的文件，给了人们有力的思想斗争武器。在短短的三年多的时间里，许多知识分子在党的鼓励下，下乡下厂接触实际，而工人建设社会主义的热情和农民走上集体化道路的生动事实，也都推动了知识分子前进。
    去年11月底匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会总结了匈牙利十五年来社会主义建设的成就，特别是反革命叛乱后三年多以来所取得的成就和经验，同时提出了发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）。这个新五年计划的主要任务是完成社会主义的奠基工作，加速社会主义的建设。到1965年，要使工业总产量比1958年至少增加65％到70％，农业增加30％到32％；同时要使生产资料的增长速度大于消费资料的增长，以加速社会主义工业化的进程。预计到1965年，工业总产量将比解放前增加大约六倍。匈牙利人民热烈地迎接了这个计划，并决心要在今年加速前进，以便为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础，同时要以出色的成就庆祝解放十五周年。今年国家基本建设投资也比过去任何一年都大，农业的投资额比去年增加27％，其中一半将用在发展农业机械化的事业上。
    匈牙利人民从今年年初就为迎接祖国解放十五周年展开了波澜壮阔的劳动竞赛，很多企业打破了过去的常规在第一季度就大大提高了生产。全国工业和交通部门有三万九千个劳动队制定了今年增产节约的竞赛目标。随着生产竞赛的深入，技术革新运动也日益开展。仅冶金和机器制造部门所属企业，今年就决定通过技术革新为国家节约价值八亿一千万福林的资金。职工们在竞赛过程中还发扬共产主义风格，广泛展开了互助协作运动。而走上了集体化道路的农民也以空前热情迎接解放的十五周年，甚至一些新成立的合作社也在互相挑战，以向国家提供更多的畜产品作为竞赛目标。拖拉机手们更是日夜三班及时完成着春耕春播工作。目前，匈牙利人民正在进行着热情高涨的劳动，加速社会主义的建设。
    匈牙利人民在社会主义建设方面取得光辉成就的同时，同社会主义兄弟国家一起，为不断加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为维护欧洲和世界和平作出了重大的贡献。所有这些都进一步加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量和世界和平的力量。我国人民把匈牙利人民的每一个成就都看成我们共同事业的成就。我们为匈牙利人民这些光辉的成就而欢呼！
    十年来，中匈两国人民的友谊有了巨大的发展，中匈两国在政治、经济和文化等方面的互助合作日益加强。1959年春天中匈两国签订了友好合作条约，进一步加强了我们两国的友好关系。在我国的社会主义建设中，匈牙利人民以机器设备和精湛的技术援助我们，在我国工作的匈牙利专家们高度的国际主义精神，鼓舞着正在建设社会主义的我国人民。我们深信，建立在共同思想和共同目标的基础上的中匈两国人民的团结，以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一定会不断巩固。
    在匈牙利人民的光辉的解放节日里，我们向兄弟般的匈牙利人民致以崇高的敬意，热烈祝贺匈牙利人民十五年来在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌的胜利！
