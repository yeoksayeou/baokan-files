Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th—Our correspondent reports: In the great "Chollima" movement, the Korean people have greatly promoted the communist style of daring to think and act, innovating and creating, helping each other, and loving labor.

　　Everyone Lends a Hand, Everyone Uses Their Brains: Technological Innovations Create Numerous Miracles

　　Inspired by the slogans of the Korean Workers' Party such as "Continue to innovate, continue to advance" and "Increase production with existing equipment and manpower," the broad masses of workers have lent a hand, used their brains, vigorously innovated technology, and created all kinds of miracles. Recently, innovation experts at the Sinchang Youth Coal Mine added a dust collector to the rock drill, changing the commonly used wet drilling method to a dry drilling method, which immediately increased the excavation efficiency by 1.5 times. Relying on technological innovation, the miners of this coal mine proposed to complete the annual production plan more than four months ahead of schedule before the 15th anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 15 this year. Chen Ying-yuan, the leader of the "Chollima Work Team" at the Jiangxian Steel Plant, and other workers, together with engineer Jin Yongzhen, studied and reformed the refractory materials used in the electric steelmaking furnace, extending the life of the furnace wall from smelting twenty times to thirty times. Workers in the thick plate workshop of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works adopted innovative measures, broke through the limitations of the machine's design capabilities, and rolled out eight-millimeter-thick steel plates. Recently, employees of various machinery factories in Korea have also creatively used tools and cutters made of hard alloys to replace the high-speed steel used in the past, increasing the cutting ability of metal cutting machine tools by four times. These facts fully demonstrate the Korean working class's fearless spirit of daring to think and act.

　　Actively Create, Work Together: Small Factories Produce Cars and Tractors

　　A style of cooperation is also flourishing on the Korean industrial front. Qiyang Machinery Factory and Dechuan Automobile Factory are using large-scale cooperation methods with other machinery factories to produce tractors and trucks. These two factories manufacture the main parts and most parts of tractors and automobiles. At the same time, employees of the Xichuan Machine Tool Factory, Yunshan Tool Factory, and other machinery factories process some precision parts such as gears and brake boxes on tractors and automobiles.

　　The Qiyang Machinery Factory and the Dechuan Automobile Factory were originally small factories producing ordinary agricultural machinery and repairing automobiles. Thanks to the creativity of the employees and the adoption of cooperative methods, they will be able to produce 3,000 high-quality tractors and trucks each this year to support agricultural mechanization. In addition, Longcheng Machinery Factory and Daan Electric Motor Factory are working closely together to produce 5,000-kilowatt turbines for the newly built power station.

　　Mutual Help and Love, Mutual Support: Advanced Collectives Help Backward Collectives

　　These days, Korean newspapers and periodicals have reported many touching stories of mutual help and love, and mutual support. The deeds of Ji Que, the leader of the "Chollima Work Team" of the Pyongyang Silk Weaving Factory, in helping backward work teams are being circulated among the broad masses of workers. After Ji Que led her work team to win the glorious title of "Chollima Work Team" last year, she voluntarily requested to go to the Fifth Work Team, which had failed to complete its production plan. After she arrived at the Fifth Work Team, she taught the sisters there the two-handed operation method, and also helped them with political study, caring for and taking care of them in their lives. This work team quickly changed its appearance and brilliantly overfulfilled its production plan in December last year and the first two months of this year. Currently, a movement to learn from Ji Que as an example of advanced helping backward is underway on the Korean industrial front.

　　Serving the People, Serving Production: Service Industries Vigorously Improve Their Work

　　In the service industry, people are also doing everything possible to serve the people and serve production. Recently, the staff of the Songlim City store of the Light Industry Department organized mobile hawkers, carrying seasonal commodities to the countryside and to the fields to serve the agricultural cooperative members who are busy with agricultural work. Shop assistants in Sucheon stores and other stores have also adopted methods to facilitate customers, such as delivering goods to their homes.

　　Love of Labor, Love of the Motherland: The Younger Generation Actively Participates in Construction

　　The noble character of love for labor is very prominent among the Korean younger generation. They have bravely taken the lead in the cause of rebuilding the motherland after the war, volunteering to go to the most difficult front lines to carry out production and construction. A labor force of thousands of young people is tunneling and building dams in the deep mountains of Ciang Province to build the Jiangjie Youth Power Station; other young people are developing the Songnam Youth Coal Mine; and another 7,500 young people are building the Youth Railway between Sandeng and Xipu. Young students, following the Korean Workers' Party's policy of "combining education with productive labor," are also enthusiastically participating in labor. This spring, more than 50 universities and colleges in Pyongyang participated in the construction of Pyongyang.

She not only helped the female workers of the work team technically, but also helped them study, enabling the Fifth Work Team to improve to the level of "Chollima Work Team" in a short period of time.

### 敢想敢干　革新创造　互助协作　热爱劳动  朝鲜人民乘“千里马”奔驰前进

    敢想敢干　革新创造　互助协作　热爱劳动
    朝鲜人民乘“千里马”奔驰前进
    新华社平壤30日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜人民在伟大的“千里马”运动中，大大发扬了敢想敢干、革新创造、互助协作、热爱劳动等共产主义风格。
    人人动手　个个动脑  技术革新创造大量奇迹
    广大工人在朝鲜劳动党提出的“继续革新、继续前进”“以现有的设备和人力增加生产”等口号的鼓舞下，人人动手，个个动脑，大力革新技术，创造出了种种奇迹。最近，新仓青年煤矿革新能手在凿岩机上增添了一个吸尘器，把习惯用的湿式凿岩法改为干式凿岩法，掘进效率一下子提高了一点五倍。这个煤矿的矿工们依靠技术革新，提出要在今年“八一五”朝鲜解放十五周年以前提前四个多月完成全年生产计划。降仙炼钢厂的“千里马作业班”班长陈应源等工人同工程师金永镇一起研究改革了炼钢电炉用的耐火材料，使电炉炉壁的寿命由炼二十次钢延长到三十次。黄海制铁所的厚板车间工人采取革新措施，突破了机器的设计能力的限制，轧出了八毫米厚的钢板。最近，朝鲜各机械厂职工又创造性地采用硬质合金制造的工具和刃具，代替过去使用的高速钢，使金属切削机床的切削能力提高了四倍。这些事实充分地表现了朝鲜工人阶级无畏的敢想敢干的精神。
    积极创造　通力协作  小工厂生产汽车拖拉机
    朝鲜工业战线上还大兴协作之风。岐阳机械厂、德川汽车工厂正同其他机械厂用大协作的方法生产拖拉机和载重汽车。这两个厂制造拖拉机和汽车的主要部分和大部分零件，同时，熙川机床厂、云山工具厂等机械厂的职工们加工拖拉机和汽车上的齿轮、闸盒等一部分精密零件。
    岐阳机械厂和德川汽车工厂本来是生产普通农业机械和修理汽车的规模不大的工厂，由于职工们发挥了创造精神，并采用了协作的方法，今年他们就能生产质量很好的拖拉机和载重汽车各三千辆，来支援农业机械化。另外，龙城机械厂和大安电机厂正在通力协作，为新建的发电站生产五千瓩的涡轮机。
    互助友爱　互相支援先进集体帮助落后集体
    这些日子，朝鲜的报刊上报道了许多互助友爱、互相支援的动人故事。平壤丝织厂“千里马作业班”班长吉确实帮助落后作业班的事迹在广大工人中间传诵着，吉确实在去年领导她的作业班取得“千里马作业班”的光荣称号以后，自动要求到完不成生产计划的第五作业班去。她到第五作业班后，把双手作业法教给那里的姐妹们，还帮助她们进行政治学习，在生活上关心和照顾她们。这个作业班很快地改变了面貌，去年12月和今年头两个月都出色地超额完成生产计划。目前朝鲜的工业战线上正展开以吉确实为榜样的先进帮助落后的运动。
    为人民服务　为生产服务  服务行业大力改进工作
    在服务行业中，人们也千方百计地为人民服务、为生产服务。轻工业省松林市商店工作人员最近组织流动货担，带着应时商品，到农村，到田间，为忙于农事的农业社员们服务。肃川商店等的店员们还采取了送货上门等便利顾客的方法。
    热爱劳动　热爱祖国  青年一代积极参加建设
    热爱劳动的高尚品德，在朝鲜青年一代中表现得很突出。他们在战后重建祖国的事业中奋勇当先，志愿到最艰苦的战线上进行生产建设。几千名青年组成的劳动大军正在慈江道的深山中凿隧道、筑大坝，建设江界青年发电站；另外一些青年在开发松南青年煤矿；还有七千五百多名青年在修三登到洗浦间的青年铁道。青年学生们遵循着朝鲜劳动党的“教育和生产劳动相结合”的政策，也踊跃参加劳动。今春平壤就有五十多个大专学校的学生参加了建设平壤的劳动。
