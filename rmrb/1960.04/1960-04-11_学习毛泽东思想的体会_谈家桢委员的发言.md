After listening to the two reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft, I felt very excited and encouraged. In addition to wholeheartedly and enthusiastically supporting them, I truly felt, as the People's Daily editorial pointed out, that these two reports presented us with a magnificent picture of 600 million people continuing to leap forward. They also demonstrated the unparalleled power of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune – the three magic weapons – and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao has long said:
	“With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear.” In order to cooperate with and promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings also need to develop at a high speed, rapidly climbing to the peak of world science and technology. This is entirely necessary and also a glorious and arduous task placed before every education and science worker.

	Thinking of my own field, biology, because its research object is living things, the level of this discipline will directly affect the development of agricultural production and health care. And how to make this discipline catch up with the advanced level quickly also means achieving the goal of a prosperous and healthy life for the people. To rapidly develop biological science, like other natural sciences, it must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Biology is very broad, and I am engaged in genetics. From graduation from university to now, I have been doing it for thirty years. Two-thirds of the time was spent during the period of reactionary rule. I cultivated a total of only a dozen students, less than one per year on average. The method adopted was to engage in it domestically for a few years and then send them abroad. After they returned to China, the research team was gradually expanded. It was truly a method of "less, slow, poor, and wasteful." To cultivate cadres who are both red and expert in a faster, better, and more economical way and to rapidly develop disciplines, we must first clarify the political direction of natural science ideologically. In the past, I thought that what I was engaged in was not social science, but natural science, and that genetics had already developed into a relatively precise discipline in foreign countries. Therefore, I one-sidedly believed that it was always beneficial to socialist construction, without thinking about how to better serve socialist construction. Ideologically, I always thought that natural science reflects the objective laws existing in nature and has no class nature in itself. Expertise would lead to solutions, which would benefit both individuals and the country. This kind of thinking of pursuing science for science's sake, detached from politics, is the result of being confused and influenced by bourgeois education for a long time. Although natural science itself has no class nature, the people who master natural science do have a class nature. Which class natural science is in the hands of, it serves that class. The same discipline can serve capitalism or socialism. Because atomic energy science can serve imperialism and be used to manufacture weapons of murder, it can also serve socialism and be used to build atomic icebreakers and atomic power stations; because genetics can serve imperialism and be used to promote reactionary theories of racism, it can also serve socialism and be used to transform the biological natural world and create more and better new biological types that are beneficial to the working people. If people engaged in natural science do not understand this, they will lose their way, and even make mistakes. This is why we must take the road of being both red and expert, deeply red and proficient.

	After clarifying who science serves, we must also ideologically recognize the laws of development of natural science itself. People like us who are engaged in natural science theory easily one-sidedly emphasize the importance of basic theory, separating theory from practice. Especially in comprehensive universities, it is even considered natural and right to engage in basic theoretical research, and that engaging in practical work is the task of agricultural colleges or medical colleges. In the past two years, China's science and technology undertakings have greatly developed, which is inseparable from the policy of linking theory with practice, fully reflecting the path of development of science itself and the correctness of Chairman Mao's "On Practice." In the development of basic theory or cutting-edge disciplines, the practice of driving disciplines with tasks has achieved great results. On the basis of summarizing the experience of agricultural bumper harvests, the content of plant physiology has been enriched, and some new theories have been derived, so that while developing this discipline, it can further guide practice. Summarizing the precious legacy of traditional Chinese medicine has played a great role in developing medical theory and establishing new medical schools. The same should be true in the field of genetics, which is a discipline closely related to agricultural production practice and health care.

	Another fundamental requirement for rapidly developing and transforming disciplines is that they must be guided by dialectical materialism. In the past, I had incorrect ideas, thinking that capitalist countries did not adopt the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism, but weren’t they also developing science? In fact, bourgeois scholars oppose dialectical materialism because it exposes not only the laws of development of nature, but also the laws of social development, which is obviously unfavorable to capitalism. Therefore, bourgeois scientists oppose it, and in the field of natural science, they have to fall into the quagmire of idealism and metaphysics. From the perspective of science itself, everything that is correct is in line with dialectical materialism. At present, in genetics, the question of the interrelationship between nucleic acids and proteins that has been revealed can only be fully understood from the perspective and method of dialectical materialism. It is undeniable that there are some metaphysical concepts in the development process of genetics that need to be criticized. I believe that arming our minds with Chairman Mao's thorough dialectical materialist thought and treating the legacy of science with the correct attitude will surely be able to rapidly develop the discipline of genetics to a new and higher stage.

	In order to develop scientific undertakings at a high speed, like other socialist construction undertakings, the most important thing is to closely rely on the leadership of the Party and implement the mass line. In the past, scientific research relied only on a few so-called experts who worked behind closed doors, believing that not only could young students not do it, but even young teachers who had just graduated from university had to go through several years of foundation-laying before they could conduct scientific research. In the past, when I was in charge of the Department of Biology and the Research Office, I only had experts in my mind and rarely considered the power of the masses. For a long time, when selecting and training talents, I also only used the presence or absence of professional ability as the standard for selecting talents, and followed a purely "expert" line. Facts have proved that this is completely a method of "less, slow, poor, and wasteful." With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production since 1958, countless worker-peasant scientists such as Wang Baojing, Zhang Qiuxiang, Wang Linhe, Li Shimei, and Cao Yixiu have emerged. It can be seen that the creation and discovery of science are often completed with the participation of the masses. Therefore, scientific research can also engage in mass movements, and must engage in mass movements. But on this issue, cognition is a process. One of the most basic and cutting-edge issues in biology is the question of the nature of life matter, that is, genetic material. I also talked about this issue at the Qingdao Genetics Symposium in 1956, pointing out the importance of the nucleic acid problem in genetics. I knew that this was the direction of genetics development, but I didn't have the courage to do it myself. I thought I had to train a group of talents who understood biological physics and chemistry first, that is, professional talents in biochemistry and biophysics, and then work together in this direction. Since the Great Leap Forward, many colleges and universities have established new majors, mostly done by young teachers who have not studied this field, and have come up with many things. There are many examples. Taking the Department of Biology of Fudan University as an example, in the past, no one had studied biophysics. Under the leadership of the Party, a group of young teachers and students, full of vigor and soaring enthusiasm, quickly built up this discipline, built several laboratories, and compiled a textbook on radiobiology. They are now also undertaking some cutting-edge scientific research tasks. This is completely the result of breaking superstitions and liberating thoughts. As mentioned above, for the nucleic acid problem, students from several majors in the department are exploring and researching it from different angles and using different methods, and have already achieved certain results.

	While carrying out mass scientific research activities in schools, it is inevitable that some problems will arise, such as insufficient supply of instruments, medicines, and materials, and the situation of damage and consumption is more serious, etc. Is this "very good" or "very bad"? After studying Chairman Mao's article on the investigation report on the peasant movement in Hunan, I had a deep understanding that the view of the mass movement can indeed reflect a person's class stand. Bourgeois educators and scientists simply can't stand or are not accustomed to this mass scientific research method, and use this as an excuse to say "a chaotic rush, all in vain." It should be recognized that even if some shortcomings occur in the mass movement, one should never abandon eating for fear of choking. One should go to the masses and work with them to solve problems, overcome difficulties and shortcomings, instead of standing aside and gesticulating. Regarding the quality of mass scientific activities, I once had such an idea, thinking that this method might cause a large quantity but the quality may not be good. After studying Mao Zedong Thought, I also gained some understanding of the relationship between quantity and quality, realizing that it is necessary to improve on the basis of a certain quantity. There are many high-quality things in the creations and inventions since the Great Leap Forward. If the masses are not mobilized, how can there be such brilliant results? It is very clear that only through mass scientific research can science develop at a high speed, and can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be brought into play. The problem today lies in how we ourselves can further put ourselves among the masses, and the key lies in whether we have the determination to get rid of individualistic thinking. As Chairman Mao said, we should be the pupils of the masses, and we should not put down our airs and be afraid of the mass movement, otherwise we will accomplish nothing. The General Line has proved to be the only correct line for building socialism at a high speed, and carrying out mass movements is the fundamental way to realize the General Line. Establishing a correct attitude towards mass movements is a test of whether we truly listen to the Party and Chairman Mao.

	In the 1960s, China must be built into a strong socialist country with a high level of modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense. This requires the construction of a strong working-class scientific and technological force to climb the peak of world science. We must hold even higher the victorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement Marxist-Leninist principles on the fundamental relationship between science and politics, science and production, and science and the masses, redouble our efforts, move forward at a high speed, so that we can shoulder the glorious and arduous tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

    学习毛泽东思想的体会
    谈家桢委员的发言
    听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的两个报告之后，非常兴奋和鼓舞，除了衷心地热烈拥护之外，确实有这样的感觉，正如人民日报社论所指出，这两个报告把一幅宏伟壮丽的六亿人民继续跃进的图画展现在我们面前，同时也显示了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝的无比威力和毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席早已说过：
  “随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”。为了配合和促进工农业生产大跃进，我国文教科学事业也需要高速度的发展，迅速攀登世界科学技术高峰，这是完全必要的，也是摆在我们每一个教育和科学工作者面前的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    联想到我自己所学的生物学。由于它的研究对象是有生命的物体，这门学科水平的高低就会直接影响到农业生产和保健事业的发展。而怎样使这门学科迅速赶上先进水平，也就意味着要达到人寿年丰的目的。要迅速发展生物科学，和其它自然科学一样，必须以毛泽东思想为指导。生物学的范围很广，我搞的是遗传学，从大学毕业到现在，搞了三十年，三分之二的时间是在反动统治时期渡过的，一共只培养了十几个学生，平均每年还不到一个，而所采取的方式，是在国内搞了几年以后就送到国外去，等他们回国后逐渐扩大研究工作的队伍，真是少、慢、差、费的方法。要多快好省培养又红又专的干部和迅速发展学科，首先必须在思想上明确自然科学的政治方向问题。我过去认为，自己搞的不是社会科学，是自然科学，而且遗传学在国外已经发展到比较精密的学科行列里，因此就片面地认为它对社会主义建设总是有利的，没有想到还有一个如何才能更好的为社会主义建设服务的问题。在思想上，总以为自然科学反映的是存在于自然界的客观规律，本身没有阶级性，专了就有办法，对个人和国家都有利。这种脱离政治为科学而科学的想法，是长期受了资产阶级教育迷惑、影响的结果。自然科学本身虽然没有阶级性，但掌握自然科学的人却有阶级性，自然科学掌握在哪个阶级手里，就为哪个阶级服务。同样一门学科可以为资本主义服务，也可以为社会主义服务。因为原子能科学，它可以为帝国主义服务，用于制造杀人武器，也可以为社会主义服务，用于建造原子能破冰船和原子能发电站；因为遗传学，它可以为帝国主义服务，用于提倡种族主义的反动理论，也可以为社会主义服务，用于改造生物自然界，创造更多更好的有利于劳动人民的生物新类型。如果搞自然科学的人不了解这一点，就会迷失方向，甚而会犯错误。为什么我们要走又红又专、红透专深道路的道理，也就在这里。
    当明确了科学为谁服务以后，还要在思想上认识自然科学本身发展的规律性。像我们搞自然科学理论的人，容易片面强调基础理论的重要性，把理论与实际分家，特别在综合性大学里，更认为搞基础理论研究是天经地义的，搞实际工作是农学院或是医学院的任务。二年来，我国科学技术事业有了很大的发展，是和理论联系实际的方针分不开的，充分体现了科学本身发展的道路和毛主席“实践论”的正确性。在发展基础理论或尖端学科上，以任务带动学科的做法，都收到了很大的效果。在总结农业丰产经验的基础上，就丰富了植物生理学的内容，得出了一些新的理论，这样就在发展了这门学科的同时，又可以进一步指导实践。在总结了祖国医学的宝贵遗产，对发展医学理论和建立新医学派，起了很大的作用。在遗传学领域里，也应该如此，这是一门密切联系农业生产实际和保健事业的学科。
    迅速发展和改造学科的另一个根本要求，就是必须以辩证唯物主义为指导思想。从前我有不正确的想法，认为资本主义国家没有采用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，不是也在发展科学吗？其实，资产阶级学者反对辩证唯物主义，是因为它在揭发了自然界发展规律的同时，也揭发了社会发展的规律，对资本主义显然不利，因此资产阶级科学家反对它，而在自然科学领域里就不得不经常陷入唯心主义和形而上学的泥坑里去。从科学本身看来，一切正确的东西，都是符合辩证唯物主义的。当前在遗传学中，揭发出来有关核酸与蛋白质之间的相互关系问题上，也只有从辩证唯物主义的观点和方法出发，才能完全可以理解的。不可否认，在遗传学发展过程中，存在着一些形而上学的概念，须要加以批判，我相信，以毛主席的彻底的辩证唯物论的思想来武装我们的头脑，以正确的态度对待科学的遗产一定能够迅速地把遗传学这门学科发展到新的更高的阶段。
    为了高速度发展科学事业，和其它社会主义建设事业一样，最重要的，必须紧密依靠党的领导，贯彻群众路线。从前的科学研究，只是靠少数所谓专家关起门来搞，认为不仅青年学生不能搞，就是刚从大学毕业的青年教师也得要经过几年打基础过程才能进行科学研究。我过去主持生物系，主持研究室，脑子里只有专家，很少考虑群众的力量，在选拔和培养人才的时候，长期以来，也是单从有无业务能力作为选才的标准，走的是单纯“专家”路线。事实证明，这完全是少慢差费的办法。随着1958年以来，工农业生产大跃进，涌现出无数的像王保京、张秋香、王林鹤、李始美、曹依秀等工人农民科学家，可见科学的创造和发现，很多是在群众参加下完成的。因此，科学研究一样可以搞群众运动，也必须搞群众运动。但在这一个问题上，认识是有一个过程的。生物学上最基本和最尖端的问题之一是关于生命物质，也就是遗传物质的本质问题。我在1956年青岛遗传学座谈会上也谈到这个问题，指出核酸问题在遗传学上的重要性。知道这是遗传学发展的方向，但是自己没有勇气去动手搞，心想先得培养出一批懂得生物学的物理和化学人才，也就是生物化学和生物物理的专业人才，然后再一起向这方面进行工作。大跃进以来，许多高等学校成立新专业，大多由没有学过本行的年青教师来干，搞出很多名堂，事例很多。就复旦大学生物系而论，过去没有一个人读过生物物理，一部分年青教师和同学，在党的领导下，意气风发，干劲冲天，很快的把这门学科建设起来了，建成了几个实验室，编了一本放射生物学教科书，现在还担任着一些尖端性的科学研究任务，这完全是破除迷信，解放思想的结果。像上面所讲的核酸问题，系里就有好几个专业的同学，从不同角度，用不同方法来进行探索研究，已经取得了一定的成果。
    在学校里开展群众性科学研究活动的同时，也不免带来了一些问题，例如仪器药品材料供应不上，损坏和消耗情况较为严重等等。这究竟是“好得很”还是“糟得很”？在学习了毛主席关于湖南农民运动调查报告的文章以后，我有了深刻的体会，对群众运动的看法确实能反映出一个人的阶级立场。资产阶级教育家和科学家根本看不惯或不习惯于这种群众性科学研究方式，就借题发挥，说什么“乱轰轰，一场空”，应该认识到群众运动中即使发生一些缺点，决不能因噎废食，应该跑到群众中间去和他们一起干，一起解决问题，克服困难和缺点，而不应该站在一边指手划脚。关于群众性科学活动的质量问题，我曾经有过这样的想法，以为这样搞法可能会造成量多而质不一定好。在学习了毛泽东思想以后，对量与质的关系上也有所体会，认识到需要在一定数量的基础上来提高。大跃进以来创造发明中有许多高质量的东西。如果不发动群众，怎能有这样辉煌的成果？非常明显，只有通过群众性搞科学研究，才能高速度发展科学，才能把群众的积极性和创造性发挥出来。今天的问题，在于我们自己如何进一步置身于群众之中，关键也就在于有无决心来摆脱个人主义的思想。像毛主席所说，当群众的小学生，不应放不下架子，害怕群众运动，否则必定是一事无成。总路线已证明是高速度建设社会主义的唯一正确路线，大搞群众运动是实现总路线的根本途径，树立起正确对待群众运动的态度是考验我们是否真正听党的话，听毛主席的话。
    在六十年代里，我国要建设成为具有高度水平的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国，就需要建设一支强大的工人阶级科学技术队伍，攀登世界科学高峰，我们一定要更高的举起毛泽东思想的胜利旗帜在科学与政治、科学与生产、科学与群众的根本关系上，贯彻马列主义原则，加倍努力，高速前进，这样才能担负起党和人民所交付的光荣而艰巨的任务。
