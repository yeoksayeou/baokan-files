This newspaper Zhengzhou, April 26th dispatch: Henan's Fugou County, on the basis of basically completing the cotton sowing task, has universally launched a large-scale inspection, appraisal, and acceptance centered on "guaranteeing acreage, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing full stands," laying the foundation for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

Sowing enough, sowing well, and sowing in a timely manner are the experiences Fugou County gained from achieving a large cotton harvest last year. Inspired by the slogan "Last year's cotton harvest was a great success; this year, take it to the next level," 50,000 commune members, after a day of trial sowing and three days of intensive effort, basically completed the state-allocated 150,000 mu cotton sowing plan by April 5th. Among them, large-scale high-yield plots reached 70%, and all achieved garden-style management. To ensure one sowing and one full stand, the Party Committee secretaries and branch secretaries of each commune personally participated in dibbling and sowing. Leadership was strengthened for weak communes and teams with large areas and scattered plots, helping these communes and production teams sow in a timely manner.

After basically completing the cotton sowing task, the CPC Fugou County Committee issued a call to cadres throughout the county to "overcome complacency, further deepen ideological mobilization, conduct comprehensive inspections, accept plots one by one, implement cotton planting acreage, and guarantee cotton planting quality," carrying out large-scale inspections, appraisals, and acceptances of "guaranteeing acreage, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing full stands" in every commune and team. The County Committee held a broadcast conference attended by more than 200,000 people. Communes also used collective reports, field meetings, roadside discussions, detailed accounting, example-giving, and visits for appraisal to once again promote the policy of taking grain as the key link, with both grain and cash crops equally important, so that commune members fully recognized that planting enough cotton well is a guarantee for comprehensively completing the state plan, consolidating the people's communes, and increasing the income of communes and members. Thus, 1,250 cadres, technicians, and local experts immediately organized 222 inspection, appraisal, and acceptance teams to go deep into the fields, conduct mutual checks and comparisons between communes and between teams, simultaneously publicizing, inspecting quality, implementing land acreage, establishing files, and issuing qualification certificates, inspecting and accepting plots one by one and field by field. During the inspection and acceptance period, 8,500 commune members in the county made a five-day effort to replant 8,115 mu, replanting and spot-planting cotton fields that were not sown to the end or to the edge; covering again those with loose soil cover; and re-repairing 5,500 mu of cotton flower five-level channels that did not meet standards.

While checking fields and replanting, guaranteeing full stands and guaranteeing acreage, all links were closely connected, and cotton field management was strengthened early. The province implemented the "six determinations" measures of fixing leaders, fixing labor, fixing technicians, fixing plots, fixing acreage, and fixing quality. 338 cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels, 28,600 laborers, and 7,672 local experts and technicians implemented long-term fixed, area-based contract management methods and carried out cotton field management. After more than 28,000 professional laborers in the county worked hard for three days, they have hoed more than 80% of the cotton fields once. For transplanting seedlings for replanting, each commune has actively prepared, having already manufactured and repaired more than 2,300 seedling transplanters.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 26th dispatch: Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, has seen a brand new situation of cotton field acreage expanding by 120,000 mu compared to last year, sowing ending eight days earlier than last year, and standards and quality being better than in previous years. Last year, Siyang County planted 180,000 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This year, under the guidance of the CPC Siyang County Committee's ideology of taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements, measures such as intercropping, multiple cropping, leveling land, and reclaiming wasteland were adopted to expand the cotton field acreage to 300,000 mu on the basis of expanding the spring-sown grain crop acreage. Because the standards and quality requirements are higher than in previous years, and cotton has the characteristic of early maturity, it is necessary to strive for more pre-summer bolls. Therefore, how to complete the cotton sowing task with high standards and high speed is a major problem. According to this situation, the County Committee decided to organize large-scale operations with production brigades as the unit to make an all-out effort. The entire county mobilized 180,000 people, organized more than 400 corps, each large corps generally has three to four hundred people, and each brigade is divided into two or three sections based on the amount of labor and cotton field acreage to conduct continuous intensive operations. To better exert the role of large corps, each corps is further organized into specialized teams for fertilizer transport, fertilizer application, land preparation, sowing, and agricultural machinery, based on labor strength, technical level, and process complexity, so that each process is well-organized.

    扶沟进行植棉大评比大检查
    泗阳种棉规格质量赛过往年
    本报郑州26日电　河南扶沟县在基本完成棉花播种任务的基础上，普遍开展了以“保面积、保质量、保全苗”为中心内容的大检查、大评比、大验收，保证了播种面积，提高了播种质量，为今年棉花大丰收奠定了基础。
    种足、种好、种适时，是扶沟县去年取得棉花大丰收的经验。在“去年棉花大丰收，今年更上一层楼”的口号鼓舞下，全县五万社员经过一天试播，三天突击，到4月5日止，基本完成了国家分配的十五万亩棉花播种计划。其中大面积的丰产方达到70％，并全部实现了园田化。为了保证实现一次播种、一次全苗，各公社党委书记、支部书记都亲自参加摇耧播种。对面积大、地块分散的薄弱社、队，还加强领导，帮助这些公社和生产队适时下种。
    在基本完成棉花播种任务后，中共扶沟县委又向全县干部发出“克服麻痹思想，再次深入思想发动，全面进行检查，逐块验收，落实植棉面积，保证植棉质量”的号召，进行了社社、队队“保面积、保质量、保全苗”的大检查、大评比、大验收。县委召开了二十多万人参加的广播大会，各公社也运用集体报告，田间会议，地头座谈，算细账，举实例，参观评比等形式，向社员再次宣传以粮为纲，粮食作物和经济作物并举方针，使社员充分认识到棉花种足种好，是全面完成国家计划、巩固人民公社、增加公社和社员收入的保证。于是，立即由一千二百五十个干部、技术员、土专家组织成二百二十二个检查、评比、验收组，深入田间，开展社与社队与队的互查互比，边宣传，边检查质量，边落实土地面积，边建立档案，边发合格证，逐块、逐片检查、验收。在检查验收期间，全县有八千五百名社员突击五天补种了八千一百一十五亩，对没种到头、种到边的棉田，进行了补种和点种；对盖土不严的进行了复盖，五千五百亩棉花五级渠道不够标准，也重新作了整修。
    在查田补种，保全苗保面积的同时，环环相扣，及早加强了棉田管理工作。全省实行定领导，定劳力，定技术人员，定地块，定面积，定质量的“六定”措施，三百三十八名县、社、大队三级干部，二万八千六百名劳力，七千六百七十二名土专家和技术员，实行长期固定，划片包干管理的办法，开展了棉田管理工作，经过全县二万八千多名专业劳力，大干三天，已将80％以上棉田锄了一遍。为移苗补栽各公社已积极进行了准备工作，已制造和整修两千三百多部移苗器。
    本报南京26日电　江苏省泗阳县出现了一个棉田面积比去年扩大十二万亩、播种时间比去年提早八天结束、规格质量比往年更好的崭新局面。泗阳县去年种植棉花十八万亩，平均每亩单产皮棉一百一十斤。今年中共泗阳县委在以粮为纲，全面安排的思想指导下，采取间作、套种、平整土地、开垦荒地等办法，在扩大春播粮食作物面积的基础上，棉田面积扩大到三十万亩。由于规格质量要求比往年更高，加上棉花又有早熟的特点，需要争取更多的伏前桃。因此，如何做到高标准、高速度地完成棉花播种任务，是一个很大的问题。县委根据这一情况，决定以生产大队为单位组织大兵团作战，全力突击。全县出动十八万人，组织四百多个兵团，每个大兵团一般有三、四百人，每个大队并根据劳力、棉田面积的多少，又划分为两三个片进行连片突击。为了更好地发挥大兵团的作用，每个兵团下面又根据劳力强弱、技术高低和工序繁简等情况，分别组织运肥、施肥、整地、播种、药械等专业组，使每一道工序都井井有条。（附图片）
