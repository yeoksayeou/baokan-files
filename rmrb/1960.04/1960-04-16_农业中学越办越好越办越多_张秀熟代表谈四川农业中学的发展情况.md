Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960.

In his report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, after presenting the tasks for this year's education work, pointed out: "We should, under the conditions of strengthening leadership and overall planning, adopt various forms of schooling to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors of society in running schools. In developing education, we must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Vice Premier Li Xiannian also proposed: "We should mobilize the forces of industry, transportation, commerce, culture and education systems to vigorously support agricultural production without exception." Based on the practical experience of the great leap forward in education in the past two years, I believe that these instructions are completely correct, and we must resolutely implement them. Now I would like to make a brief statement on the vigorous development, consolidation, and improvement of agricultural middle schools in Sichuan over the past two years.

Like agricultural middle schools across the country, agricultural middle schools in our province are the product of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, the product of the combination of Party leadership and mass movement, and also the product of implementing the Party's education policy. As early as 1956, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, a number of part-time private middle schools emerged in rural areas of our province. In the context of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the masses' enthusiasm for running schools became even higher. Once the Party called, agricultural middle schools, like "spring rain overnight, blooming flowers in the garden," rapidly developed in large numbers. The establishment of the People's Commune has opened up a broad road for agricultural middle schools and laid a solid foundation. Over the past two years, after rectification and consolidation, especially after the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, agricultural middle schools have become more consolidated. Now, they have developed from 3,582 in 1958 to 4,640, and the number of students has increased from 250,000 to 385,113 (including a small number of private middle schools and other vocational middle schools, excluding the figures for new developments this spring). More than 90% of the schools have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the masses, and have a high prestige. Among them, about 25% of the schools have become advanced schools with strong ideological work, good academic performance, and outstanding production. The development of agricultural middle schools has greatly accelerated the speed of popularizing junior secondary education. In the past two years, the province's primary school graduates have increased from an average annual enrollment rate of 37.17% during the first five-year plan to over 90%. The number of students in agricultural middle schools is already equivalent to 72.82% of the number of students in full-time junior secondary schools. Agricultural middle schools have achieved such a leap forward in just over two years, precisely because they have implemented the Party's general line and the policy of walking on two legs, and implemented the Party's education policy. Students have not only learned science and culture, but also have not been detached from agricultural production, and at the same time have provided an important source of primary technical personnel and management cadres needed by the countryside. Therefore, students welcome them, writing poems praising: "Agricultural middle school is my home, the Party is my mother, study hard and work diligently, always listen to the Party's words"; the masses also praise the students of agricultural middle schools as "both civil and military with skills, agricultural middle school education produces new people"; and also praise agricultural middle schools, saying "Agricultural middle school is a flower, all depends on the Party to cultivate it; the children used to be cowherds, today they can go to middle school, thank Chairman Mao, thank the great Communist Party."

In the past two years, we have adhered to the Party's education policy, implemented the Party's leadership and mass line, and vigorously developed and consolidated agricultural middle schools.

First, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the Party's leadership in the development of agricultural middle schools, and implement the Party's political and ideological work. Agricultural middle school is a new thing, and as soon as it appeared, it was opposed and attacked by people with bourgeois educational thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking. Many people were not sufficiently aware of the nature and development prospects of agricultural middle schools, and expressed doubts about whether agricultural middle schools could be run well. At the beginning, teachers and students of agricultural middle schools also had many ideological problems and were generally not at ease. In response to these situations, Party committees at all levels carried out a series of ideological work, widely publicized the Party's education policy, organized commune cadres and agricultural middle school teachers and students to study the central government's instructions on agricultural middle schools, launched a debate on the future and nature of agricultural middle schools, criticized bourgeois educational thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking, educated backward masses, and strengthened the school's political and ideological work. In the teachers, the individualistic ideology was repeatedly criticized, the political direction of "both red and expert" was emphasized, a communist labor attitude was advocated, their revolutionary spirit was constantly encouraged, and the teaching staff was stabilized. Socialist ideological education was insisted on among students, political lessons were well taught (mostly taught concurrently by the commune Party committee secretary), closely combined with the current central work, and the students were educated on the situation, tasks, and Party's policies, and their awareness was improved. This series of work laid a broad ideological foundation for the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, the principals of agricultural middle schools are generally concurrently held by the commune Party committee secretaries. In the past two years, our province has also adopted two methods of dispatching and promoting to equip agricultural middle schools with 933 full-time cadres. Most of these cadres are the main cadres at the level of commune Party committee members and district branch secretaries who have been tempered and politically strong. Before being sent to schools, many places conducted short-term training, organized them to study the Party's education policy, and visited advanced schools to enable them to understand school work. After arriving at the school, the county Party committee and the commune Party committee paid attention to their continuous cultivation and improvement. Therefore, the vast majority of them lead the schools very well, and forcefully refuted the fallacy that "worker-peasant cadres cannot run schools."

Second, adhere to part-work, part-study, and build agricultural middle schools into bases for the "three-way combination of science and culture, productive labor, and advanced production technology practice," and become strongholds for improving rural culture and technology. Because teaching is combined with production, education and scientific and cultural learning are carried out in productive labor, and advanced production technology is practiced, the achievements of students' productive labor are constantly growing, and at the same time, the improvement of teaching quality is promoted. This kind of "three-way combination" is a common characteristic of agricultural middle schools. In order to realize the "three-way combination," in actual work, we paid attention to grasping the following points:

(1) Properly arrange the time for teaching and productive labor. Production and learning are a unity of opposites. By arranging it, it is unified, and we insist on learning and working at the same time. Taking the Fulong Agricultural Middle School in Meishan County as an example, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the teaching plan, they arrange the time for teaching and productive labor on a monthly basis according to the agricultural season (they call it the "learning month plan"), learning more during the slack season, learning less during the busy season, adhering to part-work and part-study at ordinary times, and during the busy season, teachers go to the production team, squeeze out a certain amount of time, and focus on reviewing or teaching at fixed points and times. In this way, starting from the characteristics of the part-time system, considering the law of the agricultural season, combining persistence and flexibility, and properly arranging the time for teaching and productive labor, we can satisfy the commune, teachers are active, students have a clear idea, and ensure that there are 900 hours of class time throughout the year.

(2) Strengthened teaching work and formulated a teaching plan. Agricultural middle schools in our province generally offer courses in politics, Chinese language, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, chemistry, and agricultural knowledge. According to needs, we also compiled textbooks for Chinese language, arithmetic, physics, chemistry, agricultural knowledge, and teaching reference books for geometry, algebra, and Chinese language. Agricultural knowledge is based on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, combined with elementary botany and zoology, and various places have also compiled and supplemented teaching materials in combination with local production realities and advanced technologies. Two years of practice have shown that the establishment of these disciplines is very necessary for cultivating a person with a junior secondary level of education and for gradually realizing the needs of agricultural technology transformation, and students are very interested and enthusiastic in learning. Judging from the results of the unified examination of agricultural middle schools and ordinary middle schools held in some places during the winter vacation last year, the performance of some agricultural middle schools in major subjects has approached the level of full-time ordinary middle schools, and some have even exceeded some full-time ordinary middle schools in certain major subjects. In 1959, 22 of the 34 graduates of Majie Agricultural Middle School in Hejiang County were admitted to high schools or secondary vocational schools, with an enrollment rate of 64%, greatly refuting the fallacy that "part-time schools have a lot of productive labor and cannot learn science well."

(3) Actively open up and build production labor bases. From the beginning of operation, Party committees at all levels paid attention to opening up and building production labor bases for agricultural middle schools. 82% of the agricultural middle schools in the province have production bases. There are various forms and rich contents of productive labor: some implement industry and agriculture simultaneously; some focus on agriculture and implement diversified operations; some focus on industry (such as making fertilizers); and some implement agriculture and sideline occupations simultaneously. Generally, according to the commune's plan, combining local conditions and teaching, agriculture is the main focus, and diversified operations are implemented, or agriculture and industry are implemented simultaneously. In agricultural production, the general policy of planting less, yielding high, and harvesting more is implemented. Many schools have achieved high yield and high quality. The average yield of rapeseed per mu in Qingju Agricultural Middle School in Nanchong County was 470 jin (the local average yield is 120 jin per mu). Dabao Mountain Agricultural Middle School in Peng County, in the high mountains more than 2,000 meters above sea level, vigorously carried out advanced production technology experiments. The experimental field yielded 6,836 jin of potatoes per mu (the local average yield is 2,000 jin per mu) and 1,500 jin of corn per mu (the local average yield is 700 jin per mu), setting up a banner of high yield in high mountains. Xinxing Agricultural Middle School in the suburbs of Chongqing produced 41 kinds of chemical raw materials and chemical fertilizers, of which ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate reached a very high level. At the same time, agricultural middle schools have also achieved great results in conducting scientific and technological experiments and technological innovations. For example, Baisha Agricultural Middle School in Fengdu County conducted 58 advanced production technology experiments (eight have been successful), and held an on-site meeting at the school, praising them as: "A garden of treasures, a hundred flowers bloom; a nursery of treasures, colorful and vibrant; scientific experiments, all successful; agricultural middle school students, both expert and red." Due to the achievements in productive labor, 40% of agricultural middle schools have achieved complete or partial self-sufficiency.

Third, the province has established a teaching staff of agricultural middle schools that has been initially tempered and rectified. At present, there are 10,866 teachers in agricultural middle schools in the province, mainly junior and senior high school graduates who have just left school, some demobilized and transferred military personnel, and educated young people in society. According to statistics from 13 counties and cities, those with a junior high school education or above account for 96.3%, of which those with a senior high school education or above account for 54.5%. The vast majority are young people under the age of 30, and Party members and League members account for 40%. Their characteristics are young age and great enthusiasm. However, political training is poor and they have no teaching experience. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels first grasped the red and expert direction of teachers, mainly through regular centralized training, and at the same time, through regular political study, through productive labor training, and through participation in commune political activities, helped agricultural middle school teachers to transform their thinking and improve their awareness; in terms of knowledge and business, emphasized on-the-job improvement, learning while teaching, and fully exerted the role of the teachers' collective, relying on the collective strength of the teachers to cooperate and help each other in areas. And adopted the methods of public school guidance, correspondence courses, and vacation intensive training to improve them. Various places have also run a number of teacher training classes and crash teacher training schools to specialize in training agricultural middle school teachers. In 1958, Wenjiang Prefecture ran a crash teacher training school in Xinjin County specifically to train agricultural middle school teachers. In the past two years, it has enrolled more than 700 junior and senior high school graduates, and each term studies for two years, implementing a "one year of foundation, two years of specialization" teaching plan, and then works as an agricultural middle school teacher after graduation. This kind of school is being held in every prefecture. In the past two years, the mental outlook of agricultural middle school teachers has undergone profound changes. Many teachers do not care about remuneration, do not complain of hard work, ask if they do not understand, and learn if they do not know. Not only has their political and ideological progress been rapid, but also their teaching business has improved rapidly. More than 80% of the teachers have been basically able to undertake teaching work.

Agricultural middle schools in our province are becoming more consolidated, more numerous, better, and more popular with the masses. The achievement of such great achievements is the victory of Mao Zedong's educational thought, the victory of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the victory of the Party's education policy, and the victory of the mass movement under the leadership of the Party. Now, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the call of the provincial Party committee of "one heart, one mind, one model," the people of the province are giving more effort and striving to achieve a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in the national economic plan for 1960. Agricultural middle schools, under more favorable conditions, will undoubtedly achieve greater and new victories like other undertakings, and will play a greater and greater role in supporting agricultural production.

    农业中学越办越好越办越多
    张秀熟代表谈四川农业中学的发展情况各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    李富春副总理的报告，在提出关于今年教育事业的任务后，指出：“应当在加强领导、全面规划的条件下，采取多种多样的办学形式充分调动社会上各个方面的办学积极性。在发展教育事业中，必须继续加强党的领导，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。”李先念副总理并提出：“应当动员工业、交通、商业、文教各个系统的力量，无例外地大力支援农业生产。”根据两年来教育事业大跃进的实际经验，我认为这些指示是完全正确的，我们必须坚决贯彻执行。现在我想单就四川农业中学两年来蓬勃发展和巩固、提高的过程作一简单发言。
    我省农业中学和全国各地的农业中学一样，是总路线、大跃进的产物，是党的领导和群众运动相结合的产物，也是贯彻党的教育方针的产物，早在1956年，随着工农业生产的发展，我省农村就出现了一批半日制的民办中学。在1958年大跃进的形势下，群众办学的积极性更加高涨，一经党的号召，农业中学就如“一夜春雨，满园花开”，迅速大量地发展了起来。人民公社成立，更给农业中学开辟了广阔的道路，奠定了坚实的基础。两年多来，经过整顿巩固，特别是经过反右倾斗争的胜利，农业中学更加巩固了，现在已由1958年的三千五百八十二所发展到四千六百四十所，学生由二十五万发展到三十八万五千一百一十三人（包括少数民办中学和其他职业中学，不包括今春新发展的数字）；90％以上的学校，已在群众中生根立足，开花结果，有了很高的威信，其中约有25％的学校已成为思想工作强，学业成绩好，生产也出众的先进学校。农业中学的发展，大大加快了普及初中教育的速度。两年来全省的高小毕业生已由第一个五年计划期间每年平均升学率的37.17％上升到90％以上。农业中学在校学生已经相当于全日制初中在校学生的72.82％了。农业中学在仅仅不过两年多的时间就能取得这样的跃进，正是由于贯彻了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，贯彻了党的教育方针，学生既学习了科学文化，又没有脱离农业生产，同时并为农村所需要的初级技术人材和管理干部，提供了重要的来源。因此学生欢迎，写诗赞扬：“农中是我家，党是我妈妈，勤学勤劳动，永听党的话”；群众也夸奖农中学生是“文武双全有本领，农中教育出新人”；又赞美农中说“农业中学是支花，全靠党来培养它；娃娃本是放牛郎，今天能上中学堂，感谢领袖毛主席，感谢伟大共产党。”
    两年来，我们坚持了党的教育方针，贯彻了党的领导和群众路线，对农业中学大力进行了发展和巩固工作。
    一、坚持政治挂帅，在农业中学发展过程中加强党的领导，贯彻党的政治思想工作。农业中学是一种新事物，它一露头就遭到具有资产阶级教育思想和右倾保守思想的人的反对和打击，不少人由于对农中的性质和发展前途不够了解，对农中能够办好也表示怀疑。农中师生在开始时，思想问题也多，普遍不够安心。针对这些情况，各级党委进行了一系列的思想工作，广泛宣传了党的教育方针，组织公社干部和农中师生学习中央有关农业中学的指示，就农业中学的前途、性质等问题，展开了鸣放辩论，批判了资产阶级教育思想和右倾保守思想，教育了落后群众，加强了学校的政治思想工作。在教师中反复批判了个人主义思想，强调“又红又专”的政治方向，提倡共产主义的劳动态度，不断鼓舞他们的革命干劲，稳定了教师队伍。在学生中坚持了社会主义思想教育，上好政治课（多数由公社党委书记兼上），密切结合当前中心工作，向学生进行形势任务和党的方针政策的教育，提高了学生的觉悟。这一系列的工作，为农中的巩固提高奠定了广泛的思想基础。为了加强党的领导，农中校长一般都由公社党委书记兼任。两年来，我省还采取了派遣和提拔两种办法，为农业中学配备了专职干部九百三十三人。这批干部，大部分是经过锻炼，政治上坚强的公社党委委员和管区支部书记一级的主要干部。派到学校之前，不少地方进行了短期训练，组织他们学习党的教育方针，到先进学校参观，使他们了解学校工作。到学校之后，县委和公社党委又注意了对他们的不断培养、提高。因而他们绝大多数都把学校领导得很好，有力地回击了“工农干部不能办学”的谬论。
    二、坚持半工半读，把农业中学建设成为“科学文化、生产劳动、先进生产技术实践”三结合的基地，成为提高农村文化、技术的据点。由于教学和生产相结合，在生产劳动中进行教育、进行科学文化的学习、进行先进生产技术的实践，因而学生生产劳动的成绩不断增长，同时也促进了教学质量的提高。这样的“三结合”是农业中学的共通特点。为了实现“三结合”，在实际工作中，我们注意抓了下面几点：
      （一）妥善安排教学与生产劳动的时间。生产与学习是对立的统一，通过安排把它统一起来，坚持一边学习，一边劳动。以眉山县伏龙农中为例，他们在保证完成教学计划的前提下，根据农事季节按月安排教学与生产劳动的时间（他们叫做“学月计划”），农闲多学，农忙少学，平时坚持半工半读，大忙则由教师下生产队，挤出一定的时间，分点定时集中复习或上课。这样，从半日制的特点出发，考虑农事季节的规律，把坚持性和灵活性结合起来，妥善安排教学与生产劳动的时间，做到公社满意，教师主动，学生心中有底，保证了全年有九百小时的上课时间。
    （二）加强了教学工作，制定了教学计划。我省农中普遍开设了政治、语文、算术、几何、代数、物理、化学、农业知识等课程。根据需要又自编了语文、算术、物理、化学、农业知识等科的教材和几何、代数及语文教学参考书。农业知识系以农业“八字宪法”为纲，结合初中植物学和动物学进行编写，各地还结合当地生产实际及先进技术增编补充教材。两年来的实践表明，这些学科的设置，就培养一个具有初中程度的文化水平的人来说，就逐步实现农业技术改造的需要来说，都是非常必要的，学生学习的兴趣和劲头也是很大的。从去年寒假部分地方举行农中与普通中学统一考试的成绩来看，有一部分农中的主要学科成绩，已经接近全日制普通中学的水平，个别的在某些主要学科上还超过了某些全日制普中。合江县马街农中，1959年的三十四个毕业生，有二十二个考上了高中或中等专业学校，升学率达64％，大大驳斥了“半日制学校生产劳动多不能学好科学”的谬论。
    （三）积极开辟、建设生产劳动基地从开办起，各级党委就注意开辟和建设农业中学的生产劳动基地。全省82％的农业中学有了生产基地，生产劳动的形式多样，内容丰富：有实行工农业并举的；有以农业为主，实行多种经营的；有以工业（如造化肥）为主的；有农副业并举的。一般是根据公社规划，因地制宜，结合教学，以农业为主，实行多种经营，或者农业工业并举。在农业生产方面，一般都实行少种高产多收的方针，不少学校作到了高产优质。南充县青居农业中学十六亩油菜平均亩产四百七十斤（当地一般亩产一百二十斤）。彭县大宝山农中，在拔海二千多米的高山上，大搞先进生产技术试验，试验田洋芋亩产六千八百三十六斤（当地一般亩产二千斤），玉米亩产一千五百斤（当地一般亩产七百斤），树立了高山高产旗帜。重庆市郊区新兴农中生产了四十一种化工原料和化学肥料，其中硫酸亚铁和硫酸铜，达到了很高的水平。同时，农业中学在大搞科学技术试验和技术革新方面，也获得了很大成绩。如丰都县白沙农中进行了五十八项先进生产技术试验（已成功八种），在学校开了现场会，表扬他们是：“百宝园，百花齐放；万宝圃，万紫千红；科学试验，样样成功；农中学生，又专又红”。由于生产劳动取得成绩，已有40％的农中作到完全自给或部分自给。
    三、全省已经建立了一支经过初步锻炼和初步整顿的农中教师队伍。目前全省共有农中教师一万零八百六十六人，主要是刚出学校不久的初、高中毕业生和部分复员、转业军人以及社会知识青年。据十三个县市的统计，初中以上文化程度的占96.3％，其中高中以上文化程度的占54.5％。绝大部分是三十岁以下的青年，党团员占40％。他们的特点是年岁青、干劲大。但政治锻炼差，没有教学经验。针对这种情况，各级党委，首先抓教师的红专方向，主要是定期集中训练，同时通过经常的政治学习，通过生产劳动锻炼，通过参加公社的政治活动，帮助农中教师改造思想，提高觉悟；在知识和业务方面，强调在职提高，边教边学，充分发挥教师集体的作用，依靠教师的集体力量，划片协作互相帮助。并采用公立学校辅导、函授和假期集训相结合等办法，加以提高。各地还办了一批师资训练班和速成师范学校，专门培养农中师资。1958年，温江专区在新津县办了一所专门培养农中教师的速成师范学校，两年来招了七百多名初、高中毕业生，每期学习两年，实行“一年基础，两年分科”的教学计划，毕业后作农中教师。这种学校每个专区都正在举办。两年来，农中教师的精神面貌起了深刻的变化，不少教师不计报酬，不辞劳苦，不懂就问，不会就学，不仅政治思想进步快，而且教学业务提高也快，有80％以上的教师已经基本上能够担任教学工作。
    我省农业中学，越办越巩固，越办越多，越办越好，越办越受群众欢迎，取得这样巨大的成绩，是毛主席教育思想的胜利，是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利，是党领导下大搞群众运动的胜利。现在全省人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在省委“一条心、一股劲、一个样”的号召下，正鼓足更大干劲，为实现1960年国民经济计划全面的持续跃进而奋斗，农业中学在形势更为有利的条件下，无疑的将和其他事业一样，取得更大的、新的胜利，并对支援农业生产起到更多、更大的作用。
