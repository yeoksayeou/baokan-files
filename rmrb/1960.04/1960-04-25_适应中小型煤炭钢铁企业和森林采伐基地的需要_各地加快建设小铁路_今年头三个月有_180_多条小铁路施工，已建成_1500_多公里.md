Xinhua News Agency, 24th: "Thousands pick, ten thousand carry, happiness comes when the train arrives." This is a ballad praising local railways. Since the beginning of this year, all parts of the country have been actively building small modern railways and small indigenous railways. According to incomplete statistics for the first three months, of the more than 180 small modern and small indigenous railways under construction, more than 1,500 kilometers have been completed, and more than 800 kilometers have been opened to traffic. Henan Province, which has been building relatively quickly, has built 300 kilometers in the first three months of this year, of which more than 200 kilometers have already been opened to traffic.

These small modern and small indigenous railways are mostly built to meet the needs of local small and medium-sized coal, steel enterprises, and forest logging bases. Because its cost is low, only one-tenth to one-fifth of that of large railways; the transportation cost is low, only about one-quarter of the cost of automobile transportation; therefore, construction is fast, and the effect after opening to traffic is also significant. In Zibo City, Shandong Province, the 24 small modern and small indigenous railways that have been built have a daily transport volume of more than 40,000 tons, which strongly supports industrial and agricultural production. The small railway from Shuangshan Coal Mine to Boshan Railway Station can replace 900 handcarts every day, and it runs day and night, rain or shine; the freight for coal is greatly reduced compared to the past, saving more than 70,000 yuan per month compared to handcarts. According to this figure, all the investment in this small railway can be recovered in five months.

In the process of vigorously developing small modern and small indigenous railways, all localities, in the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, have overcome the difficulties of insufficient rails, sleepers, locomotives, and vehicles, and insufficient technical strength. The workers of the Xiangtan Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory, after more than ten experiments, used slag, cement, and sawdust to make a substitute for sleepers, solving the problem of sleepers. This kind of sleeper is being promoted in Hunan. Some places have also used slag and "three-in-one soil" to make sleepers to replace wooden sleepers. All localities universally manufacture iron rails to replace steel rails. In recent months, the technology of casting iron rails has improved rapidly. The heavy iron rails weighing 48 kilograms per meter cast in Bengbu City, and the heavy iron rails cast from local iron in Zibo City, can not only run small locomotives but also large locomotives. The locomotives needed for small modern and small indigenous railways are being manufactured jointly by railway departments and mechanical industry departments in various places. Many places have converted freight cars into railcars. This year, the state has decided to allocate a batch of Jiefang-brand trucks to be converted into locomotives for small modern and small indigenous railways.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the construction of small modern railways and small indigenous railways, the Ministry of Railways has established a General Administration of Local Railways, and many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have also successively set up local railway bureaus or specialized agencies.

### 适应中小型煤炭钢铁企业和森林采伐基地的需要  各地加快建设小铁路  今年头三个月有180多条小铁路施工，已建成1500多公里

    适应中小型煤炭钢铁企业和森林采伐基地的需要
    各地加快建设小铁路
    今年头三个月有180多条小铁路施工，已建成1500多公里
    新华社24日讯　“千人挑，万人抬，火车一通幸福来。”这是一支歌颂地方铁路的歌谣。今年以来，全国各地积极建设小洋铁路和小土铁路。据头三个月的不完全统计，正在施工的一百八十多条小洋、小土铁路中，已经有一千五百多公里建成，有八百多公里通车。建设较快的河南省，今年头三个月就修好了三百公里，其中的二百多公里已经通车。
    这些小洋铁路和小土铁路，大多是适应各地的中小型煤炭、钢铁企业和森林采伐基地的需要而兴建的。因为它的造价便宜，只有大铁路的十分之一到五分之一；运输成本低廉，只相当于汽车运输成本的四分之一左右；因此建设得快，通车后效果也很显著。山东省淄博市已经建成的二十四条小洋铁路和小土铁路，每天运量达到四万多吨，有力地支援了工农业生产。由双山煤矿通往博山火车站的小铁路，每天的运输量可以代替九百辆手推车，而且昼夜行驶，风雨无阻；煤的运费比过去大大降低了，每月可比手推车节约运费七万多元，按这个数字计算，五个月就可以收回这条小铁路的全部投资。
    各地在大办小洋铁路和小土铁路的过程中，本着自力更生的精神和刻苦钻研的干劲，克服了道轨、枕木、机车车辆不足，技术力量不足的困难。湘潭机制砖瓦厂的职工，经过十几次试验，用炉渣、水泥、锯末制成了一种代用的轨枕，解决了枕木的问题。这种轨枕正在湖南推行。还有些地方用矿渣、三合土制成了轨枕，代替枕木。各地普遍自造铁轨代替钢轨，几个月来，铸造铁轨的技术进步得很快。蚌埠市铸造出的每米四十八公斤重的重型铁轨，淄博市用土铁浇铸的重型铁轨，不仅能行驶小机车，而且可以行驶大型机车。小洋铁路和小土铁路需要的机车，正由各地铁路部门和机械工业部门协作制造，许多地方将货运汽车改装成为轨道汽车。今年，国家已经决定拨出一批解放牌汽车，改装成为小洋铁路和小土铁路的机车。
    为了加强对小洋铁路、小土铁路建设的领导，铁道部已经成立了地方铁路管理总局，许多省、市、自治区也陆续设置了地方铁路局或专门机构。（附图片）
