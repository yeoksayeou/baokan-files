Shaanxi Adapts Wheat Field Management Methods to Long-Term Drought:
    Water Seedlings Early, Fertilize Seedlings Early

Ningxia Orders Wheat Field Operating Procedures, Concentrating Efforts on Processing Three Types of Seedlings

    (Our report) This year, Shaanxi Province is experiencing a long-term drought, and wheat needs more water during the jointing stage than in the same period in previous years. In accordance with this characteristic, Shaanxi Province is launching a wheat field overproduction movement with 3 million people focusing on water and fertilizer management and carrying out "four preventions" (preventing frost, rust, insects, and lodging).
    According to past experience, it is not advisable to irrigate early or heavily during the wheat jointing stage, because early irrigation will increase the ground temperature, causing the internodes at the base of the wheat stems to elongate rapidly, which can easily cause lodging. This year, due to the long-term drought, there have been more harrowings and soil moisture conservation, which promoted wheat seedling dwarfing during the regreening period, greatly reducing the possibility of wheat lodging. Therefore, Shaanxi has broken the usual practice of late watering during the jointing stage this year, and has increased watering during the jointing stage early. The province has watered more than 14.82 million mu of wheat after the jointing stage, with some wheat fields being watered three to five times. Baoji City mobilized more than 120,000 people every day to carry out a night-time blitz to repair water conservancy facilities. As of the end of March, more than 1,300 large and small canals had been repaired; more than 6,400 new wells had been dug; and nearly 3,000 ponds had been dug, expanding the irrigation area by 63,000 mu and improving the water and land area by 28,000 mu, and more than 300,000 mu had been rushed to irrigate during the jointing stage. Due to the increased amount of water, more fertilizer seeped down, and fertilizer loss was relatively large, so it was necessary to increase the application of jointing fertilizer to compensate; secondly, a large area of dry land was turned into irrigated land, and it was also necessary to increase the application of jointing fertilizer (in the past, no jointing fertilizer was applied to dry land); this year, wheat is generally growing well, and the wheat seedlings have just entered the jointing stage and have already covered the ground. If we do not seize the opportunity to apply more fertilizer, it will be even more difficult to apply fertilizer later. Some places have put forward the slogan of "add water and add fertilizer, more fertilizer than water," and a manure accumulation movement has been launched throughout the province. Dali County launched a manure accumulation movement of "every household building a kang, every family collecting ash, every factory making fertilizer, and everyone searching for fertilizer," using the method of accumulating, sending, and applying at the same time, and collected 353.3 million jin of old kang soil, human manure, and soil fertilizer in five days; collected more than 7.4 million jin of plant ash, and applied jointing fertilizer to more than 730,000 mu. According to provincial statistics, since the jointing stage of wheat, more than 9.08 million mu of jointing fertilizer have been applied. Most of them are fast-acting fertilizers such as human manure, old wall soil, and soil fertilizer for attacking leaves and ears, and more than 5 million mu of wheat fields have been spread with plant ash once, generally more than a thousand jin per mu, which can play a role in strengthening wheat stalks and preventing lodging.
    The wheat jointing stage is the most delicate period in the growth process of wheat, so it is very important to prevent disasters such as frost, rust, and insect pests. This year, Shaanxi wheat jointed early, and it also coincided with two rains, and the climate was changeable, which could easily lead to natural disasters such as frost. Therefore, all localities have particularly strengthened the work of preventing frost, rust, and insect pests, and have made full preparations in advance. According to incomplete statistics, more than 7.68 million frost prevention pits have been dug in the province; more than 2.13 million frost prevention towers have been built, and a large amount of firewood and grass has been prepared. Hancheng, Pucheng, Tongchuan, Bin County, Baoji, and the Qinling Mountains in the Weibei Plateau have all established frost prevention headquarters, trained frost prevention technicians, and widely established frost prevention organizations. On the night of March 31, varying degrees of frost were detected in various places. That night, 2 million people were mobilized throughout the province, igniting 4.67 million frost prevention pits, and using methods such as irrigation and ash spreading to prevent frost. With the exception of a very small number of wheat fields that were damaged by frost, the frost was basically overcome. At present, frost may still occur, and all localities have strengthened climate prediction and forecasting work in order to prevent frost in a timely manner. As of the end of March, the province had carried out rust prevention work on more than 1.77 million mu of wheat fields. Insect pest control has been carried out on 1.6 million mu of wheat fields.
    Due to the above measures, the current growth of wheat seedlings in Shaanxi is very good. First-class wheat fields account for 65%, second-class wheat fields account for about 29%, and third-class wheat fields account for only about 6%. The province's high-yielding fields have increased from 6.2 million mu during the regreening period to more than 7 million mu.

    (Our report) After overfulfilling the spring wheat sowing area in terms of quality and quantity, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has launched a field management upsurge with the spirit of continuous revolution of "grasping early, grasping firmly, and grasping to the end."
    Ningxia has sown more than 2.72 million mu of spring wheat this year, plus nearly 600,000 mu of winter wheat, an increase of 32.4% over last year. At present, the wheat fields sown earlier in the Yellow River Plain irrigation area and the southern mountainous area have begun to emerge; winter wheat has also all turned green. This year, field management has been grasped early in various places, and many people's communes have achieved field management measures before the wheat seedlings have emerged. In this year's field management work, all localities have paid special attention to strengthening leadership, grasping weak links, and concentrating their main force on processing three types of seedlings. The vast majority of production teams have generally established various professional teams for wheat field management based on several major links such as wheat seedling protection, weeding, topdressing, and water diversion, and have formulated operating procedures for various field management tasks, and implemented a more detailed responsibility system to ensure that measures are implemented in the field and responsibilities are assigned to individuals. In the Yellow River Plain irrigation area, after the recent focus on the processing and management of three types of fields, first-class and second-class spring wheat fields have accounted for more than 92% of the total area. In Zhongwei County, out of more than 110,000 mu of wheat fields, first-class fields originally accounted for about 64%, second-class fields accounted for about 25%, and third-class fields accounted for about 9%. After classification and ranking, the Zhongwei County Party Committee immediately organized various communes to apply topdressing to more than 10,000 mu of third-class fields, so that the vast majority of third-class fields were upgraded to second-class or caught up with first-class fields.
    Under the guidance of the policy of simultaneously promoting high-yield and multiple harvests and multiple planting and multiple harvests, the large-area high-yield fields established by the people's communes in the Yellow River Plain irrigation area this year account for more than 30% of the total area of spring wheat. In order to better realize a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat, party organizations in various places have fully paid attention to using the leadership method of "grasping with both hands" in field management work, that is, grasping high-yield fields with one hand and grasping general fields with the other; grasping the immediate tasks with one hand and grasping the preparations for the next agricultural tasks with the other, and doing everything according to local conditions, time, and field conditions, and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in field management. In the low-lying areas of the plain irrigation area, after the recent rain, the party organizations at all levels of the commune immediately organized members to promptly drain the accumulated water in the fields, and carry out harrowing and loosening the soil to break up the surface crust, ensuring normal emergence and growth of wheat fields. People's communes in counties such as Yanchi, Taole, and Zhongwei, which are close to the Tengger Desert, have specially organized manpower to collect firewood and transport grass, and set up sand barriers with firewood and grass on the sides of the fields and canals in order to overcome the spring wind and sand that beat down wheat seedlings and block the canals. In the Helan Mountains and the Liupan Mountains, members were also organized to build a large number of frost prevention kilns in the fields, and firewood and grass were placed inside. When frost occurs, they would light fires and release smoke to prevent frost and protect seedlings. All localities have also set up fences at road junctions, field heads, and in front of and behind villages to prevent livestock and poultry from entering the fields. At present, nearly 600,000 mu of wheat in the southern mountainous area have had more than 240,000 mu applied with topdressing, and all places with irrigation conditions have also irrigated once for regreening.

    陕西适应长期干旱特点改进麦田管理方法要
    早浇拔节水　早施拔节肥
    宁夏订麦田操作规程集中力量加工三类苗
    本报讯　今年陕西省由于长期干旱，小麦在拔节期间需要较往年同期更多的水量。按照这一特点，陕西全省正掀起了一个三百万人狠抓水肥、大搞“四防”（防冻、防锈、防虫、防倒伏）的麦田超产运动。
    根据往年经验，小麦拔节期间不宜早灌水多灌水，因为早灌水会引起地温增高，促使小麦茎基部节间迅速伸长，容易造成倒伏。今年由于长期干旱，耙耱、保墒次数多，在返青期间就促使小麦蹲苗，使小麦倒伏的可能性大大减少。因此，陕西今年打破往年迟浇拔节水的贯例，提早大浇拔节水。全省在小麦拔节以后，共浇拔节水一千四百八十二万多亩，其中有的麦田浇水三至五次。宝鸡市每天出动十二万多人连夜突击修水利。截至3月底，已修大、小渠一千三百多条；打新井六千四百多眼；挖池塘近三千个，扩大灌溉面积六万三千亩，改善水地面积二万八千亩，已抢灌拔节水三十多万亩。由于水量增加，肥料下渗的多，肥力损耗较大，必需大量增施拔节肥来弥补；其次是大面积的旱塬变水地，也需要增施拔节肥（往年旱塬不施拔节肥）；今年小麦普遍生长好，刚刚进入拔节期麦苗就遮严了地皮，如果不抓紧时机多施肥，以后施肥就会更加困难。有些地方已提出“加水加肥、肥多于水”的口号，全省各地普遍开展了积肥运动。大荔县展开了“户户打炕、家家集灰、厂厂造肥、人人搜肥”的积肥运动，用边积、边送、边施的办法，五天内搜集陈墙老炕土、人粪尿、土化肥三亿五千三百多万斤；搜集草木灰七百四十多万斤，共施拔节肥七十三万多亩。据全省统计，小麦拔节以来，共施拔节肥九百零八万多亩。其中大部分是攻叶攻穗的人粪尿、陈墙土、土化肥等速效肥料，有五百多万亩麦田遍施了一次草木灰，一般的每亩都施千斤以上，这可以起到壮麦秆、防倒伏的作用。
    小麦拔节期是小麦生长过程中最娇嫩的时期，因此防霜冻、锈病、虫害等灾害十分重要。今年陕西小麦拔节早，又赶上两次落雨，气候变化无常，容易发生霜冻等自然灾害。因此，各地都特别加强了防霜、防锈、防虫害的工作，并事先做好了充分准备工作。据不完全统计，全省已挖好防霜坑七百六十八万多个；筑防霜塔二百一十三万多个，准备大量柴草。渭北高塬上的韩城、蒲城、铜川、邠县、宝鸡以及秦岭山区，都建立了防霜指挥部，训练了防霜技术人员，广泛地建立了防霜组织。3月31日夜，各地发现程度不同的降霜现象，当晚全省就出动了二百万人，燃起四百六十七万个防霜坑，并利用灌水、撒灰等方法进行防霜，除极少数麦田受冻害外，基本上战胜了霜冻。目前，仍可能发生霜冻，各地都加强了气候预测、预报工作，以便及时地防霜冻。全省截至3月底，共一百七十七万多亩麦田进行了防锈工作。防治各种虫害的麦田有一百六十万亩。
    由于采取以上措施，目前，陕西麦苗生长情况十分良好。一类麦田占65％，二类麦田占29％左右，三类麦只有6％左右。全省丰产田已由返青期间的六百二十万亩，上升到七百多万亩。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区在保质保量超额完成春小麦播种面积之后，以“抓早、抓狠、一抓到底”的不断革命精神，掀起了田间管理热潮。
    宁夏今年播种春小麦二百七十二万多亩，加上近六十万亩冬麦，比去年扩大麦田32.4％。目前，在黄河平原灌区和南部山区种得较早的麦田，已经开始出苗；冬小麦也已全部返青。今年各地田间管理抓得早，不少人民公社都做到了麦苗没有出土，管理措施到田。麦田管理工作中，今年各地特别注意了加强领导力量，狠抓薄弱环节，集中主力加工三类苗。绝大部分生产队都根据小麦保苗、薅草、追肥、淌水等几个主要环节，普遍建立了小麦田间管理的各种专业队，制定了各种田间管理工作的操作规程，实行了更加细致的责任制，做到措施到田，责任到人。黄河平原灌区，最近大抓三类田的加工管理后，春小麦的一类和二类田已经占到总面积的92％以上。中卫县十一万多亩麦田中，原来一类田占64％左右，二类田占25％左右，三类田占9％左右。分类排队后，中共中卫县委立即组织各公社对一万多亩三类田普遍施了一次追肥，使三类田绝大部分升为二类或赶上了一类田。
    在高产多收和多种多收同时并举方针指导下，黄河平原灌区各人民公社今年建立的春小麦大面积丰产方占到春小麦总面积的30％以上，为了更好地实现小麦的全面大丰收，各地党组织都在田间管理工作中充分注意运用“两手抓”的领导方法，即一手抓丰产方，一手抓一般田；一手抓眼前的活，一手抓下一步农活的准备工作，并做到因地因时因田制宜，促进田间管理全面跃进。平原灌溉区的低洼地区，最近下雨之后，公社各级党组织就立即组织社员及时排除田间积水，并进行耙地松土，破除地表板结，保证了麦田正常出苗生长。盐池、陶乐、中卫等县靠近腾格里沙漠地区的人民公社，为了战胜春季风沙打压麦苗，淤塞渠道，都专门组织了人力打柴运草，在田边、渠旁用柴草扎设了沙障。在贺兰山和六盘山麓地区，还组织社员在田间建立了大量的防霜窑，在里面放上柴草，发生霜冻时，点火放烟，防霜保苗。各地在路口、田头、村庄前后，还设置了栅墙，防止畜禽下田。目前，南部山区的近六十万亩小麦，已有二十四万多亩施了追肥，有灌溉条件的地方，也全部灌了一次返青水。（附图片）
