The Hongshunli People's Commune in Tianjin Demonstrates Great Power.
The monthly output value of commune-run industries has increased from 300 yuan to 700,000 yuan, and cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings have fully developed, presenting a scene of prosperity.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 11th: The Hongshunli People's Commune in Tianjin, the first people's commune organized mainly by street residents in Tianjin, has been continuously consolidated and strengthened since its establishment in September 1958, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of urban people's communes.

The Hongshunli People's Commune now has five branch communes, including more than 10,000 households in the 36 roads and 543 alleys under the jurisdiction of the former Tianwei Road Street Office. This commune grew out of a processing and production team composed of street women. In the summer of 1958, inspired by the Great Leap Forward, the housewives in the 42 households (one residential group) living in Hongshunli eagerly requested to step out of their small family circles and participate in socialist construction. Their wishes received strong support from the Tianwei Road Street Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. With the help of the street party committee, seventeen housewives built a simple reed shed at the entrance of the alley, installed hand-cranked spinning wheels, and established the city's first processing and production team composed of street housewives, processing copper wire winding for the nearby Hengda Wire Factory. After these seventeen housewives participated in production, they naturally requested to organize canteens and nurseries. Aunt Jia, a worker's family member, and two other housewives used a coal briquette stove to set up Tianjin's first street public canteen, making meals for 101 people in the entire alley every day. These housewives excitedly called their production team, canteen, and nursery a "socialist big family."

More than a month after the establishment of the Hongshunli Production Team, Comrade Liu Shaoqi came to inspect, which greatly encouraged these housewives and further strengthened their confidence in taking the path of collectivization. Residents from nearby streets came to visit their production team and collective welfare undertakings in an endless stream, and an activity of "learning from Hongshunli and catching up with Hongshunli" quickly and widely developed in nearby streets. Many street women organized themselves one after another, established production teams, and ran collective welfare undertakings. In order to enable these scattered production teams and collective welfare undertakings to develop faster, the Tianwei Road Street Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the demands of the masses, further organized all these units and established the Hongshunli Production Service Cooperative, with the number of members increasing to 252. Soon, the first group of housewives in Hongshunli who were organized to participate in production, such as Aunt Jia and Zong Bingzhen, jointly requested the Party organization to establish an urban people's commune in order to develop production and run collective welfare undertakings more quickly. Under the leadership of the Party organization, Tianjin's first urban people's commune named after Hongshunli was officially established on September 19, 1958.

In the year since its establishment, the Hongshunli People's Commune, after rectification and consolidation, has achieved rapid development in production and collective welfare undertakings.

Now, the entire commune has eight commune-run factories and 105 production teams, with more than 4,600 residents participating in production, the vast majority of whom are housewives. The monthly output value and processing income of these production organizations have increased from about 300 yuan in the beginning to 700,000 yuan in March 1960. In the past year, the commune's investment in building factories and adding equipment has reached more than 340,000 yuan, and the accumulation has also increased to 600,000 yuan. Now, the entire commune has more than 200 major machine equipment such as lathes, drilling machines, electric tampers, and electric sewing machines, producing 154 kinds of products such as hardware, chemicals, medical equipment, and daily necessities. The Xiyaowa area used to be a stinking ditch, but now factories have been built there. The commune members proudly call it "our commune's industrial base." The medical equipment factory run by the commune had only thirteen housewives who had just stepped out of their homes and a master craftsman when it was established in February last year. They produced some grinding materials in three rooms with a hand-cranked rammer. Now, the factory's buildings have expanded to more than 20 rooms, there are 102 workers, and it has equipment such as electric tampers, automatic machine tools, and automatic grinding wheel knives. It can not only produce grinding materials, but also manufacture more than 20 kinds of dental medical equipment. Its products are sold to Northeast, Northwest, and other regions, and the demand exceeds the supply. This factory became an advanced collective attending the 1959 Hebei Provincial Hero Conference.

The industries run by the Hongshunli Commune, because they serve large industries, serve production, and serve the people's lives, have become a powerful assistant to large factories. This commune can now produce 154 kinds of raw materials, parts, tools, and daily necessities needed by large industries. The chemical factory run by the commune could only produce some simple products in the past, but now it can produce more advanced products such as activated carbon, phenolic resin, and Sanbao paint materials needed by the chemical industry. The commune's factories and production teams also closely cooperate with large factories in an organized and planned way to process orders for large factories. Now, more than 1,700 people in the entire commune are processing semi-finished products and producing some accessories and small products for 65 large factories and enterprises, powerfully supporting the development of production in large factories.

While developing production, the Hongshunli People's Commune has also established collective welfare and service undertakings on a large scale, socializing housework, collectivizing life, and better and more comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. This commune now has 109 large and small public canteens, and more than 90% of the commune members have joined the public canteens. There are a total of 110 childcare organizations, taking care of 2,830 children, and all the children in the commune have basically entered kindergartens and nurseries.

The Hongshunli People's Commune has also vigorously developed various life service undertakings. The life service organizations of this commune are now spread all over the corners in a complete and systematic way, so that everyone has something to do and everything is taken care of. The entire commune has established 94 service organizations, with more than 600 people participating in service work. A "multi-purpose service station" they set up provides more than 300 services, meeting the various needs of the commune members. The example of comprehensively organizing the collectivization of life on Er Ma Road in this commune can show a microcosm of their development of service undertakings. They have set up 17 "departments" (life service department, hairdressing service department, elderly and children service department, cultural service department, washing, sewing, and processing department, etc.), one store (day and night circular service store), and two stations (savings station, raw and cooked water service station) on this street. The services range from handling wedding and funeral affairs to buying firewood, rice, oil, and salt on behalf of the residents, which are generally welcomed by the residents. In the Er Ma Road branch of the Hongshunli Commune, 10% of the members of the eight production teams often could not attend work due to some housework in the past. Now, after the service station takes over some major housework, the attendance rate has basically reached 100%.

The commune also carries out life service work in large factories, serving as the "rear service department" of large factories, so that workers can get rid of some trivial matters in life and participate in production more wholeheartedly. In February of this year, the commune's "multi-purpose service station" established a branch station in the Hengyuan Yarn Factory, which has more than 3,000 employees nearby. The service items of this branch station range from sewing, dismantling and washing, repairing bicycles, and childcare to buying train tickets and remitting money on behalf of the employees. After the establishment of the service station, many female workers no longer have to rush home after work to engage in housework, and can participate in meetings, study, and recreational activities with peace of mind.

The establishment of the Hongshunli People's Commune has also promoted the comprehensive development of cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings. Now, the commune has established an amateur education network from literacy classes to high school classes, and basically eliminated illiteracy among commune members under the age of 40 by the end of last year. The commune also organized technical and theoretical study groups and reading groups. There are also libraries in the commune and five branch communes. The commune also organized basketball, volleyball, table tennis teams, and amateur cultural and recreational organizations such as drama groups, Pingju groups, Beijing opera groups, music and dance groups, and creation groups, which often perform on the streets and in workshops.

The lives of the commune members in this commune have also been gradually improved with the development of production. According to a survey of 1,600 commune members conducted by the commune, the average monthly income per person has increased from 9 yuan before the establishment of the commune to more than 16 yuan now. Zhang Enlan, a female commune member, and her family of five were so poor before liberation that they wanted to commit suicide by drowning. After liberation, they relied on government relief for a long time. Now that she has joined the commune, she and her two children are working in factories, earning 117 yuan a month. In addition to food and clothing, they can save more than 10 yuan a month.

In this socialist big family, the relationship between people has also undergone profound changes. Mutual assistance, love, and unity between sisters-in-law, between husband and wife, between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and between neighbors have become a common practice. Gao Xiuzhen's family had four sisters-in-law who were all "idle people" in the past. They compared food and clothing when they had nothing to do, and were jealous of each other. Sometimes they even ignored each other all day long. After the establishment of the people's commune, all four sisters-in-law participated in production and work. They were educated in the big collective, improved their ideological awareness, and now the sisters-in-law are very close, often talking about work and ideas together, and taking care of each other.

After the vast number of housewives got rid of the trivial housework and participated in production and work, their wisdom and talents have also been brought into play. Many people have become advanced producers, and some have become glorious Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. In the past year, 118 municipal-level advanced producers, advanced workers, and red banner bearers have emerged in the entire commune. One hundred and thirteen former housewives are now the presidents of the commune's branch communes, workshop directors, and production team leaders. Wang Suqing, the mother of nine children, was originally illiterate, but now she has not only become a model of learning and a literacy teacher, but also the accountant of the commune's department store and sundry factory, and has honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Many people have also become skilled in technical innovation and technical revolution. Commune members throughout the commune have put forward more than 3,000 innovation proposals in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the commune's factories has increased from an average of 1.8% to more than 70%.

This year, the Hongshunli People's Commune will achieve greater development. According to the commune's plan, the commune's output value and processing income this year will reach 14 million yuan, an increase of nearly three times compared with the 3.6 million yuan for the entire last year. The production of commune-run factories will basically achieve mechanization and electrification this year, and the quality of products will strive to reach the level of state-owned large factories.

    迅速发展生产成为大工业的有力助手  作好生活服务充当大工厂的后勤部
    天津鸿顺里人民公社大显威力
    社办工业月产值由三百元增到七十万元，文教卫生等事业全面发展一片繁荣
    据新华社天津11日电　天津市以街道居民为主组织起来的第一个人民公社——鸿顺里人民公社，1958年9月成立以来，不断巩固壮大，显示了城市人民公社的无比优越性。
    鸿顺里人民公社，现在共有五个分社，包括原天纬路街道办事处所辖的三十六条马路、五百四十三条胡同的一万多户居民。这个公社是从一个街道妇女组成的加工生产小组发展起来的。1958年夏天，住在鸿顺里的四十二户居民（一个居民小组）中的家庭妇女，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，迫切要求走出家庭小圈子，参加社会主义建设。她们的愿望得到了中共天纬路街委员会的大力支持。在街党委的帮助下，十七名家庭妇女在胡同口搭起一个简陋的苇帘棚，安起手摇纺车，成立了全市第一个由街道家庭妇女组成的加工生产组，为附近的恒大电线厂加工缠铜丝。这十七名家庭妇女参加生产后，很自然地就要求组织食堂、托儿所。工人家属贾大娘和另外两个家庭妇女就用一个煤球炉子办起了天津市第一个街道公共食堂，每天给全胡同的一百零一个人作饭。这些家庭妇女兴奋地把她们的生产小组、食堂和托儿所叫做“社会主义大家庭”。
    鸿顺里生产小组成立后一个多月，刘少奇同志来这里视察，使这些家庭妇女们受到了巨大的鼓舞，也更加坚定了她们走集体化道路的信心。附近街道的居民们络绎不绝地来参观她们的生产小组和集体福利事业，于是一个“学鸿顺里，赶鸿顺里”的活动很快就在附近的街道中广泛地开展起来。许多街道妇女纷纷组织起来，成立了生产组和举办了集体福利事业。为了使这些分散的生产小组和集体福利事业能得到更快的发展，中共天纬路街委员会根据群众的要求，把所有这些单位进一步组织起来，成立了鸿顺里生产服务合作社，社员发展到二百五十二名。不久，鸿顺里第一批组织起来参加生产的贾大娘、宗炳珍等十多位家庭妇女，又联名向党组织要求成立城市人民公社，以便更迅速地发展生产和大办集体福利事业。在党组织的领导下，以鸿顺里命名的天津市第一个城市人民公社就在1958年9月19日正式成立。
    鸿顺里人民公社成立一年多来，经过整顿巩固，公社的生产和集体福利事业得到了飞速的发展。
    现在，全社已有八个社办工厂和一百零五个生产组，参加生产的居民有四千六百多人，其中绝大部分是家庭妇女。这些生产组织每月的产值和加工收益，由最初的三百元左右增长到1960年3月份的七十万元。一年多来，公社用于建厂房添设备的投资就有三十四万多元，积累也增加到了六十万元。现在全公社有车床、钻床、电动捣子机、电动缝纫机等主要机器设备二百多台，生产着五金、化学、医疗器械、日用百货等一百五十四种产品。原来西窑洼一带是一个臭水坑，现在那里已经盖起工厂。社员们自豪地把那里称为“我们公社的工业基地”。公社办的医疗器械厂在去年2月份成立的时候，只有十三个刚走出家门的家庭妇女和一个老师傅，在三间房子里用一台手摇捣子机生产一些研磨器材。现在这个厂的厂房已扩大到二十多间，工人有一百零二人，有了电动捣子机、自动机床、自动砂轮刀等设备，不但能生产研磨器材，而且能制造二十多种牙科医疗器材，产品行销东北、西北各地，供不应求。这个厂成为出席1959年河北省群英会的先进集体。
    鸿顺里公社办的工业由于为大工业服务、为生产服务、为人民生活服务，已经成为大工厂的有力助手。这个公社现在已能生产一百五十四种大工业需要的原料、零件、工具以及人民生活需要的日用小商品。公社办的化学厂过去只能生产一些简单的产品，现在已经能够生产化学工业所需要的活性炭、酚醛树脂、三宝漆料等比较高级的产品。公社的工厂和生产组还有组织、有计划地同大工厂密切协作，为大工厂加工订货。现在，全公社就有一千七百多人在为六十五个大工厂企业加工半成品和生产一些附件、小产品，有力地支援了大工厂发展生产。
    鸿顺里人民公社在发展生产的同时，大规模地办起了集体福利和服务事业，使家务劳动社会化，生活集体化，更好、更全面地组织了人民的经济生活。这个公社现在共有大、小型的公共食堂一百零九个，90％多的社员都参加了公共食堂。托儿组织共有一百一十处，收托着两千八百三十个孩子，全社的孩子已经基本上都进了幼儿园和托儿所。
    鸿顺里人民公社还大力发展了各种生活服务事业。这个公社的生活服务组织现在成龙成网成套地遍布各个角落，做到了人人有事作，事事有人管。全公社已经建立了九十四处服务组织，有六百多人参加服务工作。他们设立的一个“万能服务站”，服务的项目有三百多项，满足了社员群众各种不同的需要。这个公社在二马路街全面组织生活集体化的例子，就可以看出他们发展服务事业的一幅缩影。他们在这条街上设有十七个“部”（生活服务部、理发服务部、老年儿童服务部、文化服务部、洗缝补加工部等）、一店（昼夜循环服务商店）和两站（储蓄站、生熟水服务站），服务的项目从代办婚丧嫁娶事务到代买柴米油盐，应有尽有，受到居民的普遍欢迎。鸿顺里公社二马路分社有八个生产组的社员，过去有10％的人经常因为一些家务事不能出勤，现在服务站把一些主要家务包下来以后，出勤率基本上达到百分之百。
    公社还在大工厂里开展生活服务工作，充当大工厂的“后勤部”，使工人能摆脱一些生活琐事的牵累，更安心地参加生产。今年2月份，公社的“万能服务站”，在附近有三千多名职工的恒源纱厂建立了一个分站。这个分站的服务项目从缝补、拆洗、修理自行车、托儿一直到代买火车票和汇款。服务站建立以后，很多女工再也不用下班就急着回家去从事家务劳动，可以安心参加会议、学习和文娱活动。
    鸿顺里人民公社的成立，也促进了文化、教育、卫生等事业的全面发展。现在，公社已经办起了从扫盲班到高中班的业余教育网，到去年底就基本上扫除了全社四十岁以下社员中的文盲。公社还组织了技术、理论学习小组和读报组。在公社和五个分社里还设有图书馆。公社还组织了篮球、排球、乒乓球队和话剧组、评剧组、京剧组、音乐舞蹈组、创作组等业余文娱组织，经常到街头、车间演出。
    这个公社的社员生活，在生产发展的同时也逐步得到了改善。据公社在一千六百户社员中的调查，平均每人每月的收入由公社建立前的九元增加到现在的十六元多。女社员张恩兰一家五口人，解放前曾穷得要投河自杀，解放后还长期靠政府救济。现在参加了公社，她和她的两个孩子都在工厂作工，一个月收入一百一十七元，除了吃用以外，每月还能储蓄十多元。
    在这个社会主义大家庭里，人和人的关系也发生了深刻的变化。妯娌之间、夫妻之间、婆媳之间、邻里之间的互助友爱、互相团结已成为普遍风尚。社员高秀珍家妯娌四个过去都是“闲人”，没事就比吃穿，互相妒忌，有时甚至整天互不理睬。成立人民公社以后，妯娌四个都参加了生产和工作，她们在大集体里受到了教育，提高了思想觉悟，现在妯娌之间非常亲密，经常在一起谈工作、谈思想，互相照顾。
    广大家庭妇女摆脱繁琐的家务劳动参加生产和工作以后，她们的智慧和才干也得到了发挥，许多人成为先进生产者，有的人并且成为光荣的共产党员和共青团员。一年多来，全公社就涌现出一百一十八名市级先进生产者、先进工作者和红旗手。有一百一十三名过去的家庭妇女，现在成为公社的分社社长、车间主任和生产组长。九个孩子的妈妈汪素卿原来是文盲，现在不仅成了学习模范，当了扫盲教师，而且当了公社百货杂品工厂的会计，还光荣地参加了中国共产党。许多人还成为技术革新和技术革命的能手。全社社员在技术革新和技术革命运动中共提出了三千多件革新建议。全社工厂的机械化、半机械化程度，已由平均1.8％提高到70％以上。
    今年，鸿顺里人民公社将获得更大的发展。根据这个公社的规划，全社今年的产值和加工收益要达到一千四百万元，比去年全年的三百六十万元增加将近三倍。社办工厂的生产今年基本上要实现机械化、电动化，产品的质量要争取达到国营大工厂的水平。（附图片）
