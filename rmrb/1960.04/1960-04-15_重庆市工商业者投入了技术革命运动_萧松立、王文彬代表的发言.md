Chairman, fellow delegates:

We fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as other reports. We would like to focus our remarks on the situation and problems concerning Chongqing industrialists and businessmen investing in the comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" (semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation).

**Industrialists and Businessmen Have Made Some Achievements in the Technical Innovation and Revolution Movement**

Under the leadership of the Party and together with the working masses, Chongqing industrialists and businessmen responded to the Sichuan Provincial Party Congress's battle call of "the whole Party with one heart, one mind, and in one way striving to realize the great leap forward of 1960." Inspired and motivated by the National Congresses of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, many have invested in the comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" in their enterprises. Under the leadership of the Party, some have played a certain positive role and have worked with workers to achieve some results. For example, according to information gathered in early March from twelve factories in the central district of Chongqing, technical innovations have resulted in three automatic lines, ten automated projects, two semi-automated projects, fourteen mechanized projects, and seven semi-mechanized projects, totaling thirty-three items. For example, private personnel at the Huafeng Battery Factory were responsible for designing an automatic line for finished product assembly, changing the process from nine steps to one, saving thirteen laborers. According to incomplete statistics from nine commercial stores in the central district as of March 11, technical innovations have resulted in seven linkage lines, eighteen electrical and mechanical pieces, and three steam-powered pieces, totaling twenty-eight items. For example, private personnel at the Nanji Men store designed and manufactured a wharf linkage system that linked unloading, weighing, and transferring, saving six laborers. Another example is that private personnel at the Gao Da Hardware Factory in Shapingba District, under the leadership of the Party and together with the working masses, achieved a mechanized assembly line for casting, increasing work efficiency one hundred times and greatly saving labor. At the same time, an automatic screw production line was also achieved, increasing output fifty-three times. In terms of achieving mechanization, the private deputy director of the Chongqing Mold Factory designed, manufactured, and installed a rolling drum for sand cleaning, changing manual operation to mechanization, increasing work efficiency by thirty to one hundred times. Private personnel at the Chongqing Anchang Factory designed and manufactured an electric hoist cover to prevent shuttles, changing manual operation to stamping, increasing production from two pieces per day to one hundred pieces, increasing work efficiency fifty times. In general, most industrialists and businessmen, under the leadership of the Party, directly or indirectly invested in the "four modernizations" movement, did some work, and played a certain positive role. Some have made relatively significant achievements and have been recognized as advanced producers or advanced workers, and some have received honorary titles such as "technical innovation experts" and "skill competition experts." Some industrialists' and businessmen’s family members and female industrialists and businessmen have also combined participation in the "four modernizations" movement with self-reform, have shown good performance, and have helped their relatives to some extent. For example, some have changed manual paint application to mechanical operation, greatly improving work efficiency; some have helped their spouses correct the shortcomings of "more suggestions, less implementation," thereby achieving results. Some female industrialists and businessmen have received the honorary title of "March 8th Red Banner Bearer." This is a great victory for the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie, and it is also the result of industrialists, businessmen, their family members, and female industrialists and businessmen actively participating in the "four modernizations" movement and strengthening self-reform. However, these achievements are far from the great achievements of the working masses and cannot meet the demands of the great leap forward situation for our industrialists and businessmen. Our industrialists and businessmen should not hesitate to continue their efforts under the leadership of the Party and strive to make more and better achievements.

Judging from the process of our industrialists and businessmen investing in the "four modernizations" movement, there are still many objective problems, and some people are not so happy in their hearts. The main thing is: many concerns, fearing this and that, fearing responsibility, fearing making mistakes, fearing criticism, fearing tension, fearing hard work, fearing difficulties, fearing trouble. Some also have the idea of emphasizing foreign and big things while belittling indigenous and small things, thinking that if you want to do it, you should do foreign and big things, and indigenous and small things will not have much effect. Some also believe that success in "going it alone" means that honor can be enjoyed exclusively. Some also take a passive waiting attitude. These situations may vary in degree from person to person and are not completely the same; however, if these bourgeois ideas are not eliminated, they will obviously be very detrimental to our continued progress. First of all, the leadership of the Party cannot be well accepted, directions will inevitably be lost, and the support and help of the working masses cannot be obtained, and it will be impossible to achieve any results. There will also be no progress in terms of political and ideological reform. Therefore, we realize that to continue to move forward on the road of self-reform and to make more achievements in the "four modernizations" movement, we must pay attention to the following points:

**Points to be noted**

First, we must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party. "Of all the thousands of things, the leadership of the Party is the first." Anyone who leaves the leadership of the Party will accomplish nothing. If our industrialists and businessmen want to achieve results in the "four modernizations" movement, they cannot do without the leadership of the Party. At the beginning of the movement, the Party organization mobilized in light of the actual situation of the masses, and some units also organized debates: "Does technical innovation hinder production or promote production?" "Can mechanization and automation be achieved in the short term?" "What attitude should each cadre take in the movement?" Necessary assistance was also given to individuals. When the Chongqing Textile Parts Factory was working on a cutting-edge technology, it would normally take half a year based on the factory's usual working capacity; but in the "four modernizations" movement, the working masses, under the leadership of the Party, demonstrated soaring revolutionary vigor, and the project was completed in thirteen and a half days. Twelve private personnel also participated in the work of an automated line in the process of completing this task, but they went through a complex ideological struggle. Initially, many people had the idea of "emphasizing foreign and belittling indigenous" and were afraid of difficulties. The Party organization gave clear instructions such as: 1. Use waste materials to produce automated lines, 2. "Indigenous first, then foreign." At that time, in addition to doubting whether indigenous methods would work, private personnel were also concerned that they had never done automated lines before, lacked experience, and were not confident. At the same time, all trial-produced machines required everyone to design and draw their own drawings, find their own parts, assemble them themselves, and the time was short, making them feel that there were many difficulties and it was very difficult to do. After continuous education by the Party organization, although private personnel started to work on it, they still lacked confidence. It was not until the young workers of the factory took action quickly under the call of the General Branch of the Communist Youth League, completed the second automated line, and challenged the private personnel. Forced by the situation, private personnel had to make a decision to do it and then specifically formulated a short-term plan and worked with the working masses. After ten days of hard work, they successfully trial-produced four types of automatic machines and proposed one hundred innovation suggestions. Some people reformed tools, molds, and fixtures, increasing work efficiency by thirty to fifty times, which played a positive role in completing production tasks. Therefore, our industrialists and businessmen must attach importance to political and ideological reform, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, so that they can make progress, achieve results in their work, and have a bright future.

Second, we must constantly eliminate various kinds of bourgeois individualism. At present, the "four modernizations" movement is in full swing, changing rapidly and developing continuously, and has formed a great national movement. However, some of our industrialists and businessmen still have various doubts and concerns. For example, some people are concerned that if the technical innovations they propose are not successful and cause losses to the enterprise, they will be labeled as destroying production and they will not be able to bear the responsibility; some people believe that technical innovation and daily production are contradictory, fearing that technical innovation will affect the completion of production tasks; some people are concerned that the technical innovations that come out are not good enough and are shelved and unused, causing waste, and the responsibility will fall on their own heads, and they will be criticized by others; some people think that they are busy with business and have already worked too long, and they do not have time to think independently and engage in technical innovation; some people are concerned that to engage in technical innovation, they have to work hard with the workers and cannot rest; some people think that engaging in technical innovation is asking for trouble and suffering, "it is better to do less than to do more"; some people are afraid to make rationalization proposals, because whoever makes the rationalization proposal has to do it, and if it is successful, they have to do it again, and they have to make more proposals after making them; there are also many people who emphasize that there are few people and many difficulties, thinking that to engage in technical innovation, it cannot be done without raw materials, it cannot be done without power equipment, there are no technical personnel to draw drawings, so we have to take our time, and it will not be achieved overnight; commerce is not as easy to do as industry. With the above-mentioned concerns and doubts, bowing to difficulties everywhere, and planning everything for personal gain, it is impossible to achieve results in the "four modernizations" movement. If ideological concerns can be continuously eliminated, it is possible to complete the glorious task of technical innovation. A private technician in the Chongqing Nanyang Cigarette Factory initially considered issues from the perspective of personal fame and status, and his thinking was not clear, and he was once unhappy. After ideological struggle, he made a suggestion to the factory, which was of course quickly agreed upon. The Party organization hoped that private personnel would form a group to engage in some technical innovations together. The private personnel were concerned that the factory had basically achieved automation, and it would be a big problem to engage in automation again. Under the instruction of the Party organization, they could engage in the automatic production line of cigarette bricks. After research, the private personnel formulated a plan and guaranteed to complete it in three days and nights. Then, they were concerned that the technical strength was not enough and feared that their guarantee could not be realized. Through the education of the Party and the drive of the working masses, the private personnel's joint efforts aroused interest in practical work and enhanced confidence and courage. After three days and three nights, they finally succeeded in trial production, improved work efficiency, saved more than ten laborers, and successfully completed the task assigned by the Party. Therefore, our industrialists and businessmen must constantly eliminate bourgeois individualism, overcome "I at the head," gradually establish the working class collectivism, proceed from the interests of the 600 million people in everything, actively and actively invest in the "four modernizations" movement, and strive to "do the work," "do the work cleverly," resolutely "take care of one end" and "lean to one side," and strive to contribute more to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Third, we must firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, combine with the masses, and learn from the masses. The principle of "more people, more strength" and "many people gather firewood, the fire is high" has also been proven in the "four modernizations" movement. Anyone who wants to make achievements quickly must firmly believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, firmly rely on the masses, and combine with the masses. The Party's mass line working method is a long-tested and powerful weapon. In the "four modernizations" movement, it has shown powerful power everywhere. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "The victory of all undertakings must rely on the masses, and all work must follow the mass line. This is our firm principle." In the industrial field, the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" summarized by the Party has become a good system for improving enterprise management. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out: "Close combination of leaders, workers, and technicians, working together with one heart and one mind, and doing everything possible, will surely create miracles in technology." Therefore, we must overcome the idea of "going it alone," and we must not only cooperate with technicians, but also work with general administrative personnel. A private technician in the Nan'an District of Chongqing worked with three administrative personnel (one works in the kindergarten, one serves as a workshop recorder, and one serves in the workshop, all three are female comrades.) After three days and nights of joint efforts, a cigarette screening machine was made. We firmly believe in the masses and rely on the masses, which is not only a matter of method, but also a matter of position and viewpoint. According to the proletarian world view, history is created by the people. Therefore, our industrialists and businessmen must make up their minds to gradually transform the bourgeois world view into the working class world view, firmly believe in the masses, and rely on the masses. At the same time, we are relying on the most glorious and promising working class. The working class's love for the Party, love for socialism, selfless labor, selfless public service, pioneering spirit, and highly noble qualities of collectivism will always be a shining example for our industrialists and businessmen to learn from.

We must also study political theory, current affairs policies, advanced experience, culture, and technical knowledge, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works, which is extremely important for our industrialists and businessmen to destroy capitalism and establish socialism, transform themselves, and improve their awareness. Mao Zedong Thought is our guide to revolutionizing ourselves and successfully carrying out all our work. We must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought and implement it in our practical actions.

In short, we should see that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" is developing like a landslide and the situation is infinitely beautiful. We must more actively invest in the "four modernizations" movement under the leadership of the Party; at the same time, strengthen political and ideological reform, strive for continuous progress, and continue to make more achievements for socialist construction. We must closely combine political and ideological reform with labor practice, promote each other, and promote each other. We must also follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central Committee of the Party, resolutely "take care of one end," take care of the interests of the country and the people; "lean to one side," and firmly lean to the side of socialism. That is, to implement the guarantee we made to Chairman Mao Zedong: "Listen to Chairman Mao wholeheartedly, follow the Party wholeheartedly, accept transformation wholeheartedly, and serve socialism wholeheartedly." Only in this way is our bright and correct path; only in this way is it the only way for us to strengthen self-education and self-reform in socialist construction; only in this way can we contribute to socialist construction.

    重庆市工商业者投入了技术革命运动
    萧松立、王文彬代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理所作的报告和其他报告。我们仅就重庆市工商业者投入“四化”（半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化）为中心的全面的技术革新、技术革命运动的情况和问题作如下的发言。工商业者在技术革新和技术革命运
      动中做出了一些成绩
    重庆市工商业者在党的领导下和工人群众一道，响应了中共四川省党代会“全党一条心、一股劲、一个样为实现1960年的大跃进而奋斗”的战斗号召，并在民建会和工商联两会全国代表大会的影响和鼓舞下，不少人在企业中投入了以“四化”为中心的全面的技术革新、技术革命的运动。有些人在党领导下，发挥了一定的积极性，还和工人一起做出了一些成绩。例如重庆市市中区工业的十二个厂在3月初了解的情况，技术革新已实现自动线三条，自动化十项，半自动化两项；机械化十四项，半机械化七项，共三十三项。如华丰电池厂私方人员负责设计成品组自动线，由九道工序改为一道工序，节约了劳动力十三人。市中区商业九个商店，截至3月11日的不完全统计：技术革新已实现联动化七条，电动化、机械化十八件，蒸汽化三件，共计二十八件。如南纪门商店私方人员设计和制造码头联动化，将卸车、过秤、转动联动化，节约劳动力六人。又如沙坪坝区高达五金厂私方人员在党领导下和工人群众一起实现了铸工机械化流水自动线，提高了工效一百倍，大大节约劳动力。同时，还实现了螺丝生产自动线，提高了产量五十三倍。在实现机械化方面，如重庆模具厂私方副厂长设计、制造、安装清砂滚筒化，改手工操作为机械化，提高工效三十至一百倍。重庆安昌厂私方人员设计、制造电动葫芦防梭盖子，改手工操作为冲压，由每天作两个提高到作一百个，提高工效五十倍。总的来说，大多数工商业者在党领导下直接或间接投入了“四化”运动，或多或少地做了一些工作，发挥了一定的积极性。有些人还做出了比较显著的成绩，被评为先进生产者或先进工作者，有的人还得到“技术革新能手”、“技巧赛能手”等光荣称号。还有些工商业者家属和女工商业者，在参加“四化”运动中，结合进行自我改造，有了好的表现，帮助亲人也起了一些作用。如有人把油漆手工操作改为机械操作，大大提高了工效；有人帮助爱人改正了“建议多、实现少”的缺点，因而做出了成绩。有的女工商业者得到“三八红旗手”的光荣称号。这是党的对资产阶级和平改造政策的伟大胜利，也是工商业者、工商业者家属和女工商业者积极投入“四化”运动、加强自我改造的结果。但是这些成绩，和工人群众的伟大成就来比，那就差得太远了，更不能适应大跃进形势对我们工商业者的要求。我们工商业者应该毫不迟疑地在党的领导下继续努力，争取做出更多更好的成绩。
    从我们工商业者投入“四化”运动的过程来看，客观上还存在着不少问题，有些人心情上也不是那么愉快。主要的是：顾虑重重，怕这怕那，怕负责任，怕犯错误，怕批评，怕紧张，怕苦战，怕困难，怕麻烦。还有些轻土、重洋、贪大的思想，认为要搞就搞洋的、大的，土的，小的起不了多大作用。也有人把“单干”成功，荣誉可以独享。也有人抱着消极等待态度。这些情况，对我们每个人来说，可能有多有少，并不完全相同；但是，这些资产阶级思想如不加以清除，显然对我们继续前进是非常不利的。首先就不能很好地接受党的领导，必然迷失方向，也得不到工人群众的支持与帮助，就不可能做出什么成绩。在政治思想改造方面也得不到进步。因此，我们体会到：要在自我改造途程上继续迈进，要在“四化”运动中做出更多的成绩，必须注意以下几点：
        必须注意的几点
    第一，必须坚决依靠党的领导。“千条万条，党的领导第一条。”任何人离开党的领导。任何人离开党的领导，就会一事无成。我们工商业者要在“四化”运动中做出成绩，更离不开党的领导。在运动开始的时候，党组织针对群众的实际情况作了动员，有些单位还组织了辩论：“技术革新是妨碍生产？还是促进生产？”“在短期内能不能实现机械化，自动化？”“每个干部在运动中应该抱什么态度？”对个别人还进行了必要的帮助。重庆纺配厂在搞一项尖端技术的时候，按该厂平时工作能力，需要半年时间；但在“四化”运动中，工人群众在党的领导下发挥了冲天的革命干劲，结果十三天半就完成了。在完成这一任务过程中，私方人员十二人也参加了一种自动线的工作，但经过复杂的思想斗争过程。最初，不少人有“重洋轻土”思想和畏难情绪，党组织作了：1、利用废旧料搞生产自动线，2、“先土后洋”等明确指示。当时，私方人员除怀疑土法是否能起作用以外，还顾虑自动线过去没有搞过，缺乏经验，把握不大。同时，所有试制的机器，要求各人自己设计绘图，自己找零件，自己装配，而且时间短促，感到困难重重，很不好搞。经党组织不断教育，私方人员虽然开始搞了，仍然缺乏信心。直到全厂青年工人在共青团总支号召下，很快地行动起来，搞成了第二道自动线，并向私方人员提出了挑战。私方人员迫于形势，不得不下决心搞，才具体订出了短期规划，和工人群众一道，经过十天苦战，试制成功了四种自动机器，并提出革新建议达一百条。有些人改革工模夹具，提高工效有的达到三十倍到五十倍，对完成生产任务起了积极作用。所以，我们工商业者必须重视政治思想改造，紧紧依靠党的领导，才能有进步，才能在工作上做出成绩，也才能有光明的前途。
    第二，必须不断破除各种各样的资产阶级个人主义思想。目前，“四化”运动正搞得热火朝天，瞬息万变，不断地飞跃发展，已形成伟大的全民性的运动。可是我们工商业者中间有些人，仍有种种怀疑与顾虑，例如有些人顾虑到：我提出的技术革新若搞不成功，使企业受到损失，被人家给我戴上破坏生产的帽子，那我就负不起责任；有人认为搞技术革新和日常生产有矛盾，怕搞了技术革新影响生产任务完不成；有人顾虑搞出来的技术革新不像样子，搁置不用，造成浪费，责任落到自己头上，要受到人家的批评；有人认为自己业务忙，工作时间已经过长，没有时间独立思考，再搞技术革新；有人顾虑要搞技术革新，就要和职工一起苦战，不能休息；有人认为搞技术革新是自找麻烦，自讨苦吃，“多一事不如少一事”；有人怕提合理化建议，因为那个提的合理化建议就要那个做，做成功了还要再做，提过了还要再提；还有不少人强调人少，困难多，认为要搞技术革新，没有原材料不能搞，没有动力设备不能搞，没有技术人员绘图，只好慢慢来，要搞，也不是一朝一夕的事；商业还不如工业好搞些。像以上所说的顾虑这样，怀疑那样，处处向困难低头，事事为个人打算，就不可能在“四化”运动中做出成绩。如果能够不断地解除思想顾虑，就有可能完成技术革新的光荣任务。重庆南洋烟厂有位私方技术人员，最初，从个人名位出发考虑问题，思想上有些不通，情绪上一度不愉快。经过思想斗争，才向厂里提出建议，当然很快得到同意。党组织希望私方人员组成一个小组，共同搞一些技术革新。私方人员顾虑到本厂已基本实现了自动化，要再搞自动化，大成问题。经党组织指示，可以搞烟砖生产自动线。私方人员经过研究订出规划，并保证在三昼夜完成。接着，又顾虑技术力量不够，怕自己的保证不能实现。经过党的教育，工人群众的带动，私方人员的通力合作，在工作实践中引起了兴趣，增强了信心和勇气，经过三天三夜，终于试制成功，提高了工效，节约劳动力十余人，胜利地完成了党交给的任务。所以，我们工商业者一定要不断破除资产阶级个人主义，克服“我字当头”，逐步树立工人阶级集体主义，事事从六亿人民的利益出发，主动积极地投入“四化”运动，努力做到“干字当头”，“巧字当头”，坚决“顾一头”“一边倒”，争取为祖国的社会主义建设事业多多贡献力量。
    第三，必须坚决相信群众，依靠群众，和群众结合，向群众学习。“人多力量大”，“大家拾柴火焰高”的道理，在“四化”运动中同样得到证明。任何人要很迅速地做出成绩，必须坚决相信群众的智慧和力量，坚决依靠群众，和群众结合。党的群众路线的工作方法，是久经考验的强有力武器。在“四化”运动中，处处都显示了强大的威力。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“一切事业的胜利都要依靠群众，一切工作的进行都要走群众路线，这是我们坚定不移的原则。”工业方面，党总结出的“两参一改三结合”的方针，已成为改进企业经营管理的好制度。李富春副总理指出：“领导人员、工人群众、技术人员三者密切结合，同心协力，千方百计，就一定能够在技术上创造出奇迹。”所以，我们一定要克服“单干”思想，不仅要和技术人员合作，而且要和一般行政人员一起搞。重庆南岸区有一个私方技术人员同三位行政人员（一人搞幼儿园工作，一人担任车间记录，一人在车间服务，三位都是女同志。）通力合作，经过三昼夜的努力，就制成了一部筛烟机。我们坚决相信群众，依靠群众，不仅是一个方法的问题，而且是一个立场、观点的问题。根据无产阶级的世界观，历史是人民群众创造的。所以，我们工商业者一定要下决心把资产阶级的世界观逐步改造成为工人阶级的世界观，坚决相信群众，依靠群众。同时，我们所要依靠的正是最光荣的最有前途的工人阶级。工人阶级的热爱党、热爱社会主义、忘我劳动、大公无私、首创精神、集体主义高等贵品质，永远是我们工商业者学习的光辉榜样。
    还要学习政治理论、时事政策、先进经验、文化、技术知识，特别是毛主席著作的学习，对于我们工商业者破资立社，改造自己，提高觉悟，极为重要。毛泽东思想是我们自己革自己的命，胜利进行一切工作的指南。我们一定要认真地学习毛泽东思想，并贯彻到实际行动中去。
    总之，我们应该看到：以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，正如排山倒海地向前发展，形势无限美好。我们一定要在党的领导下更积极地投入“四化”运动；同时，加强政治思想改造，争取不断进步，继续为社会主义建设做出更多的成绩。我们一定要把政治思想改造和劳动实践密切地结合起来，互相推动，互相促进。还要遵照党中央刘少奇副主席的指示，坚决“顾一头”，顾国家利益，人民利益；“一边倒”，坚定不移地倒向社会主义这一边。也就是要贯彻执行我们向毛泽东主席提出的保证：“一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟着党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务。”只有这样，才是我们光明、正确的道路；只有这样，才是我们在社会主义建设中加强自我教育和自我改造的唯一途径；只有这样，才能在社会主义建设中贡献力量。
