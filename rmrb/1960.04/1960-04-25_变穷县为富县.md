A Diary Entry from a Party Secretary

    Turning a Poor County into a Rich County
    Zhao Linzeng, First Secretary of the CPC Jianhe County Committee, Guizhou Province

    Jianhe is a high-altitude mountainous area inhabited by various ethnic groups. Cultivation techniques are backward, involving slash-and-burn agriculture with wooden tools. Historically, wheat and rapeseed were never grown, and damage from wild animals was rampant. People referred to landlords, bandits, and wild animals as the three scourges of the area, saying, “Arriving in Jianhe, your heart turns cold.” Moreover, the fields here are scattered, making it difficult to transport manure to the slopes.
    However, the area is rich in natural resources. It now produces rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, rapeseed, hemp, and other food and cash crops. Underground, there are more than ten kinds of minerals, including iron, lead, and quartz. Forest resources are extremely abundant, with cedar, pine, tung, tea, oak, and chestnut trees scattered throughout the county.
    The past backwardness and poverty were facts, but they were caused by exploitation and ethnic oppression. Ethnic minorities have "high aspirations despite poverty," and they urgently demand a rapid change in their backward and impoverished conditions. Therefore, starting from the characteristics of ethnic minorities, it is necessary to develop production and construction at high speed.
    Over the past two years, the county Party committee has fully grasped the characteristic of ethnic minorities having "high aspirations despite poverty," and has estimated the possibilities of the Great Leap Forward. We have proposed that our area has more superior conditions than the central area: high mountains and high water sources, abundant resources, water where it is needed, fertilizer where it is needed, money where it is needed, grain where it is needed, meat where it is needed, conditions are very good, and whether or not the mountainous area can be changed depends on "human effort." Thus, a mass ideological emancipation upsurge was launched, dispelling feelings of inferiority and establishing the ambition to "catch up with the Han areas and compete with the plains," inspiring people of all ethnic groups to wage an unyielding struggle against the poor mountains and wild forests. The broad masses put forward the resounding slogan, "The mountains are big, but our determination is bigger; the mountains are high, but our aspirations are higher." They sang: "High mountains, low mountains, treasure mountains, countless treasures to pick; now the commune has great strength, the poor have aspirations higher than the sky; go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results; it's not difficult to turn from poor to rich." Facts have proven that the Party's proposition of leading the ethnic minority people to rapidly change their backward and impoverished conditions will transform into endless power once it meets the masses. As long as there is a call from the Party, the masses will respond enthusiastically, their energy soaring like wildfire. During the fertilizer accumulation campaign at the beginning of 1959, the county Party committee set a requirement of 40,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Despite the freezing weather and heavy snowfall, more than 80,000 people across the county enthusiastically responded to the call of the county Party committee, with more than 50,000 of them camping on the mountains, universally implementing the "six ups" of people, oxen, canteens, leadership, medical care, and study. An elderly man named Yang Lao Jiu (Miao ethnicity), over seventy years old, refused to be outdone by his age, tending to thirteen cattle alone and cutting more than 400 jin of grass every day. The women's team was also unwilling to be outdone, determined to compete with the young men. People sang heroically: "Heavy snow falls, light snow drifts, accumulating fertilizer with aspirations higher than the sky, guaranteeing fertilizer goes into the treasure account, grain production is sure to break the thousand-jin mark." During the peak season of production, despite the contradictions of large area and small labor force in our county, with the collective wisdom and efforts of all ethnic groups, no difficulties could stop us. During the rice transplanting season last year, summer harvest, transplanting, and fertilizer transportation were all crammed together. More than 12,000 women across the county devoted themselves to plowing the fields, becoming the first generation of skilled plowmen in Jianhe. More than twenty women steered rafts on the Qingjiang River. An old man over seventy years old in Taihong Commune drove eight oxen alone, transporting 18,000 jin of fertilizer a day. Yang Changyu, a Miao carpenter, created a water-powered plank sawing and rice milling machine, increasing work efficiency by nineteen times, making us further realize that people's subjective initiative is endless. Thanks to the vigorous mass movement, processing technology was also innovated. In the major autumn production process, everything was ahead of schedule, with transplanting one month earlier than in previous years, harvesting two months earlier, and even autumn plowing, autumn sowing, and autumn grain completed simultaneously.
    In the struggle to conquer nature, the people of all ethnic groups displayed their majestic power. The entire county mobilized 80,000 people to go up the mountains to collect treasures, traversing the mountains and fields, collecting 700 million jin of mountain products, with a total value exceeding the total annual grain income. In the transportation of products, some people were worried that "you can't see the sky when you open the door, the mountains are high and the roads are uneven," and how could a large amount of mountain products be transported down the mountain. However, the broad masses proposed that it is good to build cableways and chutes on high mountains, and to use carts on flat land, not only transporting the mountain products, but also expanding the transportation capacity. The same is true for processing problems. It is a very arduous task to utilize more than 700 million jin of mountain products, but in the face of the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups, there are no insurmountable difficulties. Lacking processing tools, the masses were mobilized to donate them; lacking technology, Party committees at all levels established more than 380 secretary factories to teach the masses how to overcome technical barriers, thereby launching a mass "ten thousand factory" movement for processing, successfully completing the task, and turning mountain products into wealth. Our produced daily necessities not only meet the needs of the entire county, but also sell well in other places, and our Qingjiang Daqu liquor, embroidery, tannin extract, camphor wood boxes, rosin and other famous products are well-known throughout the province and the country.
    Over the past year, we have clearly seen that the people of all ethnic groups have become tools for taming nature. They fought the fields and produced a county with 1,000 jin of rice per mu; they fought the mountains and produced a great harvest of mountain products. When the people sang about this great change, they said: "The leaves in the mountains are lush and green, countless treasures in the mountains, in the past the treasures rotted in the mountains, now Jianhe is full of gold, abundant food and clothing, a good life, endless happy songs."

    变穷县为富县
    中共贵州剑河县委第一书记　赵林增
    剑河是一个民族杂居的高寒山区，耕作技术落后，刀耕火种，烧山下种，用木质农具，历史上从未种过麦子、油菜，兽灾非常厉害。人们把地主、土匪和兽灾称为这里的三大祸根，所谓“走到剑河城，冷去半边心”。再说这里的田土东一丘、西一丘，有粪也送不上坡。
    然而这里物产资源是丰富的，现在已出产水稻、小麦、苞谷、薯类、油菜、青麻等粮食作物和经济作物；地下宝藏有铁、铅、水晶石等十多种矿石；林木资源极为丰富，杉、松、桐、茶、青杠、麻栗等散布全县。
    这里过去落后、贫困是事实，但这是剥削阶级和民族压迫造成的。少数民族“人穷志气高”，他们迫切要求高速度地改变落后、贫困的面貌；因而从少数民族的特点出发，就是要高速度地发展生产建设事业。
    两年来，县委充分掌握了少数民族的这种“人穷志气高”的特点，估计到大跃进的可能性，提出了我们这里比中心区具有更多的优越条件：山高水高，资源丰富，要水有水，要肥有肥，要钱有钱，要粮有粮，要肉有肉，条件很好，能否改变山区，决定于“事在人为”。于是掀起了群众性的思想解放高潮，丢掉了自卑感，树立了“赶汉区，赛平原”的雄心壮志，启发各族人民与穷山野林进行了不屈不挠的斗争。广大群众提出了“山大没有我们决心大，山高没有我们志气高”的响亮口号，他们这样歌唱：“高山低山万宝山，满山宝贝拣不完；如今公社力量大，人穷志气比天高；鼓足干劲加油干，由穷变富并不难”。事实证明，党领导少数民族人民迅速改变贫困落后面貌的主张，一旦和群众见面，就会变成无穷无尽的力量；只要有党的号召，群众就会一呼百应，干劲冲天，势如烈火燎原。1959年初的积肥运动，县委提出亩肥四万斤的要求，尽管天寒地冻，大雪纷飞，但全县八万多人热烈响应了县委的号召，其中有五万多人上山扎营，普遍推行了人、耕牛、食堂、领导、医务、学习六上山。有位七十多岁的杨老九（苗族），年老不服老，一个人看管十三条牛，每天还割四百多斤草。妇女队也不甘示弱，决心和小伙子们见高低。人们豪迈地唱道：“大雪落来细雪飘，积肥干劲比天高，保证肥料升宝帐，粮食定破千斤关”。在生产紧迫的季节里，尽管我县存在着面积大、劳力少的矛盾，但有各族人民的群策群力，什么困难也阻挡不住。在去年的插秧季节，夏收、栽插、运肥等活路挤在一块，全县有一万二千多个妇女投入了犁田，成了剑河第一代的犁耙能手；有二十多个妇女在清江河上架驶放排；台拱公社一个七十多岁的老头，一人赶着八头牛，一天运肥一万八千斤；苗族木工杨昌雨创造水力解板、打米机，提高工效十九倍，使我们进一步认识人的主观能动性是无穷无尽的。由于有声势浩大的群众运动，加工技术也革新了，在大秋生产工序上，都赶在季节的前面，栽插比往年提早了一个月，收割提早了两个月，连秋耕秋种、秋粮同时完成。
    在征服大自然的斗争中，各族人民显示出了气势磅礴的威力，全县出动八万人上山取宝，走遍了丛山遍野，采得山货七亿斤，总值超过了全年的粮食总收入。在产品运输中，原来有人担心“开门不见天，山高路不平”，大量山货怎能运下山来，可是广大群众提出山高好搞索道化、梭槽化，平地就搞车子化，不仅运出了山货，而且壮大了运输力量。加工问题也是如此，要把七亿余斤山货利用起来，是一件十分繁重的任务，但是，在勤劳勇敢的各族人民面前，没有不可克服的困难，缺乏加工用具，就发动群众捐献；没有技术，各级党委搞了三百八十多个书记厂，教会群众度过技术关，从而掀起了群众性的加工“万厂”运动，胜利地完成了任务，山货变成了财富。我们出产的日用品除了满足全县需要外，还畅销外地，并有清江大曲酒、刺绣、栲胶、樟木箱、松香等名产闻名全省和全国。
    一年来我们清楚地看到，各族人民已经成为驯服大自然的工具，他们斗了田，斗出了水稻千斤县；斗了山，斗出了山货大丰收。人民群众歌唱这个伟大的变化时说：“山中木叶皮皮青，山中宝物数不清，过去宝在山中烂，如今剑河满地金，丰衣足食生活好，幸福歌儿唱不尽”。
