Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: Washington News: The raging fire of the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee's brutal rule has aroused serious concern among the American authorities, the behind-the-scenes boss of the Syngman Rhee clique. On the 19th, the U.S. State Department summoned Liang Yuchan, the so-called "ambassador" of the Syngman Rhee clique in Washington, to plan further suppression of the South Korean people's uprising. The State Department also took unusual steps to publicly issue a statement on the situation in South Korea, interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean people.

In its statement, the State Department expressed "deep and growing concern over continuing public unrest and violence in (South) Korea." It wanted the Syngman Rhee clique to "pay attention" to the "seriousness of the reactions abroad" to the situation in South Korea, because this would "greatly undermine" South Korea's so-called "international standing and prestige."

The State Department's statement hypocritically asked the Syngman Rhee clique to take so-called "necessary and effective actions to protect democratic rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, and to maintain secret voting," but this statement inadvertently confessed that the United States is the "closest friend, supporter, and ally" of the Syngman Rhee clique. The Associated Press said that the United States believes that any internal weakening of South Korea would make this so-called "bastion of the free world" vulnerable to the so-called "invasion by the communists north of the 38th parallel." This statement by the Associated Press once again exposed the United States' attempt to use the situation in South Korea to create incidents in Korea in order to intensify the suppression of the South Korean people.

The news said that the U.S. State Department also presented a memorandum to Liang Yuchan regarding the situation in South Korea. Liang Yuchan's remarks after leaving the State Department showed that the United States is urging the Syngman Rhee clique to intensify the suppression of the people's uprising. He said, "Secretary of State (Herter) told (him) that if these things (referring to the South Korean people's uprising against the Syngman Rhee clique) continue, it would make President Eisenhower feel very unpleasant during his visit to (South) Korea." Liang Yuchan also slandered the South Korean people's uprising against the Syngman Rhee clique as having "communist agents participating" in an attempt to create excuses for the Syngman Rhee clique's bloody suppression of the uprising.

Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: New York News: The "New York Herald Tribune" clamored today that the United States "has a responsibility" to interfere in the South Korean people's struggle.

This mouthpiece of American monopoly capital said that the United States is "extremely concerned" about the situation in South Korea. No matter what the outcome, "we cannot avoid our responsibility for (South Korea's) future." It lavishly praised Syngman Rhee's anti-communist "merits" and said that America's "prestige" is definitely linked to South Korea, and "all of non-communist Asia is watching how we will act."

On the same day, Agence France-Presse issued a message from Washington saying that "people in the U.S. capital emphasize that if the freedom of the Seoul government is threatened again, it can count on the support of some countries that fought alongside the South Korean army against communism."

It also said: "American experts studying Far Eastern issues are closely monitoring these (South Korean) events every hour."

The news also revealed that the United States is worried that the development of the situation in South Korea will be detrimental to Eisenhower's upcoming activities in South Korea. It said: "Some people pointed out that if these events are still going on when President Eisenhower goes to Seoul for a brief visit on June 22, he will find the situation very embarrassing."

An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th admitted that the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule has deep social roots. It said: "The lives of most residents are extremely poor. Many Koreans have no hope for the future."

Even this American news agency cannot conceal Syngman Rhee's brutal fascist rule. It said that Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party has failed to satisfy the general public's desire for more democracy and freedom."

It also said: "In recent years, Syngman Rhee's party has increasingly used the police and its majority in the parliament to suppress freedom—closing opposition newspapers, restricting assembly and freedom of speech, interfering in elections, and using coercive means in the parliament to achieve its legislative intentions."

This news agency said: The South Korean people's struggle has presented Syngman Rhee with the most serious crisis in his twelve years in power in South Korea.

    美国力促李承晚集团加紧镇压起义人民
    赫脱说事态如果继续下去将使艾森豪威尔的访问非常不愉快
    “纽约先驱论坛报”叫嚷美国有责任干涉南朝鲜人民的斗争
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：南朝鲜人民反抗李承晚残暴统治的怒火燎原的斗争，已经引起李承晚集团的后台老板美国当局的严重不安。美国国务院19日召见李承晚集团驻华盛顿的所谓“大使”梁祐灿，策划进一步镇压南朝鲜人民的起义。国务院还采取不同寻常的步骤，公然就南朝鲜的局势发表声明，干涉朝鲜人民的内政。
    国务院在它的声明中对“在（南）朝鲜继续发生的公众不满和暴力行动表示深切和愈益增长的不安”。它要李承晚集团“注意”南朝鲜的局势在“国外引起的反响的严重性”，因为这将“大大削弱”南朝鲜的所谓“国际地位和威望”。
    国务院的声明假惺惺地要李承晚集团采取所谓“必要的和有效的行动以保护言论、集会、出版自由等民主权利，并维护秘密投票”，但这个声明不打自招地供认，美国是李承晚集团“最密切的朋友、支持者和盟友”。美联社说，美国认为，南朝鲜内部的任何削弱都会使这个所谓“自由世界的堡垒”容易受到所谓“三八线以北共产党的入侵”，美联社这番话再一次暴露了美国企图利用南朝鲜局势在朝鲜制造事端以加紧镇压南朝鲜人民的打算。
    消息说，美国国务院还就南朝鲜局势向梁祐灿提出了一项备忘录。梁祐灿在离开国务院后发表的谈话，说明了美国正力促李承晚集团加紧镇压人民的起义。他说，“（美国）国务卿赫脱曾（对他）说，如果这些事情（指南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的起义）继续下去，那就会使总统艾森豪威尔在访问（南）朝鲜时感到非常不愉快”。梁祐灿还污蔑南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的起义有“共产党代理人参预”，以图借此为李承晚集团血腥镇压起义制造借口。
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”今天叫嚷美国“有责任”干涉南朝鲜人民的斗争。
    这家美国垄断资本的喉舌说，美国“极其关切”南朝鲜的局势。不论结果怎样，“我们不能避免对（南朝鲜）将来的责任”。它大捧李承晚反共的“功劳”，并且说，美国的“威望”肯定地已同南朝鲜结合在一起，“整个非共产党亚洲正在注视我们将怎样行动”。
    同一天，法新社从华盛顿发出的一条消息说，美国首都的“人们着重指出，如果汉城政府的自由再度受到威胁，它可以指望曾同南朝鲜军队并肩对共产主义作战的一些国家给予支持”。
    它还说：“美国研究远东问题的专家们正每小时每小时地密切注意着这些（南朝鲜）事件”。
    消息还透露，美国担心南朝鲜局势的发展不利于艾森豪威尔即将去南朝鲜活动。它说：“某些人士指出，如果艾森豪威尔总统6月22日到汉城去作短暂的访问时这种事件仍在继续进行的话，他会感到这种局势令人非常为难的”。
    美联社19日发自东京的一条消息承认，南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争有着深刻的社会根源。它说：“大多数居民的生活贫穷不堪。许多朝鲜人对将来一无希望。”
    李承晚的横暴的法西斯统治甚至连这家美国通讯社也无法掩盖。它的说法是：李承晚的“自由党没有能够满足一般人要求得到更多的民主和自由的愿望”。
    它还说：“最近几年来，李承晚的政党越来越甚地利用警察和国会中的多数来抑制自由——封闭反对党的报纸，限制集会和限制言论，干涉选举，在国会中用压服手段来实现它在立法方面的意图”。
    这家通讯社说：南朝鲜人民的斗争已经在李承晚面前提出了他在南朝鲜执政十二年来最严重的危机。
