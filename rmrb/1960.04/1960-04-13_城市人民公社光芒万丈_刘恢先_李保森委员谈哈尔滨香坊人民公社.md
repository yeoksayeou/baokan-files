We warmly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state's final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960; we also fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

We were very excited when Vice Premier Li Fuchun mentioned in his report that it is necessary to accelerate the development of people's commune industries and street industries and gradually incorporate them into the national plan. We would like to report our understanding of urban people's communes.

We come from Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province. The urban people's commune movement in our city has been going on for more than a year since it began in August and September of 1958. Since the beginning of spring this year, the movement has entered a new climax, and it will not be long before the entire city can be communalized. Although the commune is still in its initial stage, its brilliance shines like the rising sun, showing unparalleled superiority and vitality. Now, let's take a typical commune in our city - the Xiangfang People's Commune - as an example to illustrate the superiority of the urban people's commune.

The Xiangfang People's Commune was born in September 1958. At that time, due to the Great Leap Forward in production, state-owned industries in this area faced problems such as insufficient labor, a lack of supporting factories, and welfare services for employees that could not meet the needs. At that time, everyone was taking various measures to solve this problem, such as mobilizing and organizing street residents to carry out certain auxiliary labor for state-owned factories and providing services for the lives of state-owned enterprise employees. At this moment, Chairman Mao said during an inspection in Shandong: "The people's commune is still good." Under this wise enlightenment, and according to the instructions of the provincial and municipal party committees, the people's commune was established. The masses asked to join the commune one after another, and called the list of commune members the "Happiness List" to express their wishes. Under the correct leadership of the Party, after two years of consolidation and development, the Xiangfang People's Commune has now become a people's commune that closely combines state-owned and local state-owned industries, commune-run industries, agricultural production brigades, and street resident management districts. The entire commune has a population of 160,000 and an area of 320 square kilometers. This commune, like a happy and united big family, is carrying out the heroic cause of socialist construction.

Over the past year, countless facts have proven the superiority of urban people's communes.

One, the commune has mobilized the positive factors of all parties, cooperated with each other, developed industrial production, and implemented the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and walking on two legs.

The Xiangfang People's Commune originally had three state-owned factories and fifteen local state-owned factories. At the beginning of the commune's establishment, there were more than 400 commune-run factories, which were consolidated and merged into 44. Now, they have developed to 137 and are still developing. By adopting the policy of focusing on industrial production, ensuring key points, and driving the general, the comprehensive development of industrial production has been promoted. In 1959, during the continued Great Leap Forward, the industry of the entire commune completed the annual state plan 62 days ahead of schedule, with a total output value 64% higher than in 1958, of which the commune-run industry increased by 1.2 times. There will be a greater leap forward in 1960, and the total industrial output value is estimated to increase by 100% compared to 1959. The production plan for the first quarter has been successfully completed ahead of schedule.

In the Great Leap Forward, the phenomenon of universal labor shortage appeared. The establishment of the commune mobilized and organized a large number of women from families to participate in social labor, solving the shortage of labor in industrial enterprises. Under the unified arrangement of the commune, the completion of state tasks by key factories was powerfully guaranteed. For example, in the second half of 1958, the commune supplemented the Harbin Bearing Factory with more than 4,000 laborers, enabling the factory to complete the annual plan three days ahead of schedule.

The commune, in accordance with the Party's "walking on two legs" policy, combines large, medium, and small enterprises, guides commune-run industries to serve industrial and agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people, and organizes all small factories to link up with large state-owned factories. Some of these commune-run factories specialize in processing and auxiliary production for large factories; some directly use the scraps and waste materials of large state-owned factories to produce daily necessities for urban and rural people; and some, with the support and help of large state-owned factories, use their own products to support the needs of all aspects of the national economy. The following three examples can illustrate the superiority of combining large, medium, and small enterprises: (1) Sixteen small factories were organized within the commune to specifically serve the state-owned bearing factory. Over the past year, they have produced 500,000 tool holders and various tools, 350 tons of castings, more than 240,000 paper boxes, and more than 500,000 wooden boxes, not only ensuring the Great Leap Forward in bearing production, but also saving 640,000 yuan for the country in one year by utilizing side materials and reducing transportation costs. (2) The electrical appliance factory, which was started by only one engraver and two watchmakers, has grown from three people to a factory with 550 people through their own hard work and the support of state-owned enterprises and other commune-run industries. It has developed from manufacturing simple current transformers to manufacturing more than 20 kinds of products such as advanced electronic stethoscopes and electric motors, which sell well in more than ten provinces. At the same time, it has developed from unfixed products to one of the supporting factories specializing in the production of electrical equipment for Harbin's three major power plants. (3) The original hemp rope factory with dozens of workers was transformed into a satellite bearing factory with the help of the state-owned bearing factory. It has now developed into a bearing factory with more than 600 workers, more than 60 machines, and an annual output of 1 million sets, greatly exceeding the total bearing output of China at the time of liberation.

The relationship between the linked large factories and small factories is very close, giving full play to the role of small factories helping large factories and large factories leading small factories, and playing a role of mutual promotion and mutual guarantee in production.

In order to better organize the cooperation between various enterprises within the commune, the Xiangfang People's Commune has established a regular coordination meeting system, which has greatly strengthened the planning of cooperative production between various enterprises. In the past, work that needed to be organized in other cities and provinces for cooperation can now be largely resolved within the commune.

The above facts fully show that the cooperation between various enterprises within the commune not only guarantees the Great Leap Forward of key state-owned factories and enterprises, but also enables medium and small enterprises to achieve rapid development and improvement. At the same time, the commune, with production as the center, has also powerfully promoted the comprehensive leap forward in transportation, material supply, cultural education, health, and sports.

Two, the commune comprehensively organizes agricultural production, systematically and further guaranteeing the needs of the people's lives.

Harbin is a region with a relatively cold climate, and there is a shortage of vegetables in winter, which used to rely on supplies from other places. However, in 1959, vegetables achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, not only being self-sufficient but also supporting other places. This is because the commune adopted the policy of self-reliance, organized factories, enterprises, and organizations to closely cooperate with agricultural production brigades, carried out deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation in the spring of 1959, and fought against natural disasters such as freezing, wind, drought, diseases, and insects. Thanks to the support of all parties, 50,000 square meters of greenhouses were also built in 1959, ensuring the supply of fresh vegetables all year round. In terms of animal husbandry, by training technical personnel, arranging forage land, and establishing a professional breeding team of 2,400 people, 118 livestock farms were developed. As a result, the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries in 1959 increased by 86% compared to 1958.

The agricultural production plan for this year is even larger, and a plan to create ten "ten thousands" has been put forward. These are: 10,000 mu of high-yield vegetable experimental fields, 10,000-pig farms, 10,000-chicken mountains, 10,000-duck bays, 10,000-square-meter cold storage, 10,000-square-meter vegetable cellars, 10,000-square-meter mushroom greenhouses, 100,000-square-meter vegetable greenhouses, 3 million potted vegetables, and 50,000 tons of sugar beets. After this plan is realized, the entire commune will reach a level of one to one and a half pigs per person, ten to thirteen poultry per person, one square meter of greenhouse, and six jin of vegetables per person per day.

Thanks to the strong support of industry, agricultural production brigades have basically achieved mechanization in addition to field management, and are now further advancing towards the four modernizations of agriculture (mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, and communization of factories), which has further strengthened the integration of urban and rural areas and further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance.

Three, the commune comprehensively promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

The state-owned enterprises in the commune have relatively strong technical forces. They use their spare time to concentrate their efforts to assist commune-run industries in carrying out the "double innovation" movement and establishing new enterprises, with remarkable results. For example, large factories such as the Harbin Bearing Factory, with their science and technology departments and workshops as units, are responsible for assisting commune-run industries in specific areas. At present, the commune-run factories have simple equipment and mostly manual operation. With a little mechanization and automation, the production capacity can be increased several times, thereby making it possible to transfer labor to support newly established factories. The Xiangfang Experimental Chemical Plant, after vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, used simple methods to replace extremely complex chemical equipment, greatly improving production efficiency. The commune's livestock farm has realized automatic pig feeding lines, and one person can feed 3,000 pigs.

Four, welfare undertakings have been greatly developed, housework has been socialized, and women have been thoroughly liberated.

With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a new situation facing the commune is that the vast number of women have participated in social labor and cannot take care of housework, leaving them with worries. Therefore, the commune grasped production with one hand and life with the other, and vigorously established street service stations to gradually socialize housework. The commune first strengthened its leadership over the welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens spontaneously organized by the masses, unified the training of cooks, childcare workers, and educators, and constantly summarized experiences to consolidate and improve them. At the same time, the medical and health departments of the entire commune are organized to be responsible for the epidemic prevention and medical work of these collective welfare units in designated areas. In many streets, when the workers who participate in production go to work, the service station staff washes and mends their clothes, takes care of the sick, and manages the children on their behalf. In addition to this, the service station also buys rice, grain, firewood, and coal for the workers and handles all the entrusted affairs that can be handled on their behalf. By the beginning of March this year, the entire commune had established 278 comprehensive service stations, 232 public canteens, 222 nurseries and kindergartens, 3 hospitals, 19 clinics, 3 health stations, and 18 health clinics, forming a systematic service network and medical network, ensuring that every neighborhood committee has a service station and every resident group has a service worker. The socialization of housework not only relieves the worries of women participating in production, but also encourages other women to participate in some work within their capabilities according to their different situations. They have all made contributions to socialist construction, are overjoyed to be economically self-reliant, and are happy to participate in political, cultural, and technical learning. Now, women's labor has become the main force in commune-run industries and service undertakings.

With the great development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in the number of employed people, the income of the people of the entire commune has generally increased, the social purchasing power has greatly increased, and the living standards of the people have generally improved.

Five, the commune has developed cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings, strengthened the political and ideological education of the masses, and greatly improved people's political consciousness and collectivist thinking.

After the commune members participated in productive labor, they were trained and educated in common labor and common life, and the relationship between people became closer. Everyone helps each other and promotes each other, like a family. After the political consciousness is improved, the enthusiasm for production is even higher, and the collectivist thinking and communist style of everyone for the collective and everyone for the commune are greatly promoted.

After the establishment of the commune, a commune-wide cultural and educational network and a scientific and technological network adapted to commune production are being formed. This year, in addition to vigorously developing and popularizing secondary education, running spare-time education on a large scale, scientific research work will also be carried out on a large scale. At the same time, exciting plans have also been made in organizing mass study of Marxism-Leninism, studying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously developing sports and health campaigns, vigorously developing various creations and developing literary and artistic activities, and so on.

Six, the commune facilitates the acceleration of urban construction work.

The people's commune is a basic-level social organization that combines government and society, and can mobilize positive factors in all aspects. Under the unified planning of the province and city, it can carry out the planning and construction of the entire commune quickly, well, and economically. For example, problems such as the transformation of old cities, the rational layout and use of public utilities, the layout of residential areas, commercial networks, living welfare networks, and satellite towns can all be solved under a unified arrangement and concentrated efforts.

In short, the benefits of urban people's communes are endless. Countless facts over the past year have proven that it is the inevitable product of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. In its development process, the social productive forces have been further liberated, and the people's communist consciousness has been heightened, which proves that it will be the best organizational form for the transition from socialism to communist society in the future. The vast number of workers, peasants, and street residents express infinite love for the commune. They sing praises to Chairman Mao and the people's commune, saying: "Chairman Mao has built a happy stage, and the working people have come up. The mountains are there, the water is there, and the stones are there. Poverty will never come again." We are determined to be good commune members and strive for the prosperity and development of the commune and for the high-speed socialist construction of the motherland. We cannot help but shout: Long live the urban people's commune!

    城市人民公社光芒万丈
    刘恢先　李保森委员谈哈尔滨香坊人民公社
    我们热烈拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告；也完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的政协全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    李富春副总理在报告中提到要加速人民公社工业和街道工业的发展，逐步纳入国家计划，我们感到十分兴奋，特此把自己对于城市人民公社的体会作一汇报。
    我们来自黑龙江省哈尔滨市。我市城市人民公社运动自从1958年8、9月间开始，已经有一年多的历史。今年入春以来，运动进入到一个新的高潮，不要好久，就可以实现全市公社化。公社虽然还是处于初办的阶段，但是它的光辉却像初升的太阳，光芒万丈，显示出无比的优越性和生命力。现在就我市一个典型的公社——香坊人民公社来说明城市人民公社的优越性。
    香坊人民公社是在1958年9月诞生的。当时这个地区的国营工业由于生产大跃进，存在着劳动力不足，辅助性工厂缺少以及职工福利事业不能适应需要等等问题。那时大家都在采取各种办法解决这个问题，如动员和组织街道居民群众来为国营工厂进行某些辅助劳动和为国营企业职工群众生活服务等等。正在这个时候，毛主席在山东视察时说：“还是人民公社好”。在这个英明的启示下，根据省市委的指示，人民公社就办起来了。群众纷纷要求入社，并把社员名单称为“幸福榜”来表示自己的心愿。在党的正确领导下，经过两年的巩固和发展，现在香坊人民公社已经成为一个国营及地方国营工业、社办工业、农业生产大队和街道居民管理区紧密结合的人民公社。全社人口十六万，面积三百二十平方公里。这个公社像一个美满团结的大家庭一样，进行着豪迈的社会主义建设事业。
    一年多来，无数的事实证明了城市人民公社的优越性。
    一，公社调动了各方面的积极因素，互相配合，发展工业生产，贯彻了大中小相结合、两条腿走路的方针
    香坊人民公社原有国营工厂三个，地方国营工厂十五个。社办工厂在公社成立之初有四百多个，经过整顿合并成四十四个，现在又发展到一百三十七个，尚在不断发展中。由于采取了以工业生产为中心，保证重点、带动一般的方针，促进了工业的生产全面发展。全社工业在1959年继续大跃进中，提前六十二天完成了全年的国家计划，总产值比1958年提高64％，其中社办工业增长一点二倍。1960年将有更大的跃进，工业总产值估计可比1959年增长一倍，第一季度生产计划已经胜利地提前完成。
    大跃进中出现了劳动力普遍不足的现象。公社的成立从家庭动员和组织了大量的妇女，参加了社会劳动，解决了工业企业劳动力的不足。在公社统一安排下，有力地保证了重点工厂完成国家任务。例如在1958年下半年，公社为哈尔滨轴承厂补充了四千多名劳动力，使该厂提前三天完成全年计划。
    公社按照党的“两条腿走路”的方针，使大中小型企业相结合，引导社办工业为工农业生产和城乡人民生活服务，组织所有的小工厂分别同国营大工厂挂钩。这些社办工厂，有的专为大工厂进行加工和辅助性生产；有的直接利用国营大工厂的边材废料生产城乡人民生活必需品；有的在国营大工厂的支持和帮助下，以自己的产品支援国民经济各方面的需要。下面三个例子可以说明大中小型企业相结合的优越性：（一）社内组织了十六个小厂专门为国营厂轴承厂服务，一年来打刀杆和各种工具五十万件，翻砂三百五十吨，糊纸盒二十四万多个，做木箱五十多万个，不仅保证了轴承生产大跃进，而且由于利用边材、减少运输费用，降低成本，一年内为国家节约六十四万元。（二）仅仅由一个刻字匠和两个钟表匠筹办的电器厂，经过自己的穷干、苦干、和国营企业与其他社办工业的支援，如今已由三人发展到五百五十人的工厂；由制造简单的电流互感器发展到制造高级的电子听诊器、电动马达等产品二十余种，畅销十余省，同时，由产品不固定发展到专门为哈尔滨三大动力厂生产电器器材的配套工厂之一。（三）原有几十名工人的草麻绳厂经过国营轴承厂的帮助改建成一个卫星轴承厂，现已发展成为一个拥有六百多名工人，六十多台机器，年产一百万套的轴承厂，大大超过了解放时全中国的轴承产量。
    挂上钩的大厂和小厂之间的关系非常密切，充分发挥了小厂帮大厂，大厂带小厂的作用，并且：在生产上起了相互促进和相互保证的作用。
    为了更好地组织社内各企业之间的协作，香坊人民公社建立了定期协作会议制度，大大加强了各企业间协作生产的计划性；以往需要到外市外省去组织协作的工作，现在绝大部分可以在公社内部解决了。
    上列事实充分说明，社内各企业的协作不仅保证了国家重点工厂企业的大跃进，而且使中、小型企业也获得迅速发展和提高。同时，公社以生产为中心，还有力地推动了交通运输。物资供应、文化教育、卫生和体育等方面工作的全面跃进。
    二，公社全面组织了农业生产，有计划地和进一步保证了人民生活的需要
    哈尔滨是气候比较严寒地区，冬季蔬菜不足，以往都依靠外地供应。但1959年，蔬菜获得空前大丰收，非但能自给自足，而且还支援了外地。这是由于公社采取自力更生的方针，组织工厂企业、机关团体与农业生产大队密切协作，在1959年春季进行了深翻地和积肥运动，并和冻、风、旱、病、虫等自然灾害进行了斗争。由于各方面的支援，在1959年还建成了五万平方米的温室，保证了一年四季新鲜蔬菜的供应。在畜牧方面，通过培训技术人员，安排饲料用地，建立了一支二千四百人的专业饲养队，发展了一百一十八个畜牧场。这样，1959年的农副业总产值比1958年增长了86％。
    今年农业生产计划更大了，提出了搞十个“万”的计划，这就是：万亩万斤蔬菜试验田，万猪场，万鸡山，万鸭湾，万平方米冷藏库，万平方米菜窖，万平方米蘑菇温室，十万平方米蔬菜温室，三百万个盆菜，五万吨甜菜。这个计划实现以后，全社将达到每人平均一至一头半猪，十至十三只家禽，一平方米温室，每人每天六斤蔬菜的水平。
    由于工业的有力支援，农业生产大队，除田间管理外，已基本上实现了机械化，现正进一步向农业四化（机械化、水利化、电气化与公社工厂化）推进，这样就进一步加强了城乡结合和进一步巩固了工农联盟。
    三，公社全面地推动了技术革新和技术革命运动
    公社的国营企业技术力量比较雄厚，它们利用业余时间，集中力量，协助社办工业大搞双革运动和建立新企业，效果显著。如哈尔滨轴承厂等大厂以科室车间为单位，分片包干，负责协助社办工业。目前社办工厂设备简陋，手工操作较多，稍加机械化，自动化，就能成倍地提高生产能力，从而可能抽调劳动力，支援新办工厂。香坊实验化工厂，经过大闹技术革命，用简易办法代替了极为复杂的化工装备，大大提高生产效率。公社畜牧场实现了喂猪自动线，一人能喂三千头猪。
    四，大大发展了福利事业，使家务劳动社会化，使妇女得到彻底解放
    随着工农业生产的大跃进，公社所面临的一个新情况，就是广大妇女群众参加了社会劳动，对家务照顾不过来，有后顾之忧。因此公社就一手抓生产，一手抓生活，大办街道服务站，使家务劳动逐步社会化。公社首先对群众因陋就简，自发举办的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等福利事业加强领导，统一训练炊事员、保育员和教养员，不断总结经验，巩固提高。同时，组织全社医疗卫生部门，分片包干，负责这些集体福利单位的防疫和医疗工作。在许多街道，参加生产的职工上班去了，服务站的人员便给他们洗补衣服、照看病人、代管孩子，除此以外，服务站还为职工代买米粮柴煤，代办一切可以办到的委托事务。到今年3月初，全社已经办起综合性服务站二百七十八处，公共食堂二百三十二处，托儿所和幼儿园二百二十二处，医院三个，门诊部十九个，保健站三个，卫生所十八个，形成了有系统的服务网与医疗网，做到了每个居民委员会都有服务站，每个居民组都有服务员。家务劳动社会化非但解除了参加生产的妇女的后顾之忧，而且鼓励了其他妇女根据自己的不同情况参加一些力所能及的工作。她们都为对社会主义建设作出了贡献，为自己在经济上能够自立，为参加了政治、文化、技术学习而欢欣鼓舞，笑逐颜开。现在妇女劳动力已经成为社办工业和服务事业的主力军。
    随着工农业生产的大发展，就业人数的增多，全社人民群众的收入普遍增加，社会购买力大大提高，人们的生活水平也普遍提高了。
    五，公社发展了文教、科学事业，加强了群众的政治思想教育，大大提高了人们的政治觉悟和集体主义思想
    社员们参加生产劳动后，在共同劳动、共同生活中，得到了锻炼，受到了教育，人与人之间的关系更加密切了。大家互相帮助，互相促进，好比一家人。政治觉悟提高后，生产积极性更为高涨，大大发扬了人人为集体，人人为公社的集体主义思想和共产主义风格。
    公社建立后全社性的文化教育网和与公社生产相适应的科学技术网正在形成。今年除大力发展和普及中等教育、大办业余教育外，并大搞科学研究工作。同时，在组织群众性的学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作、大搞体育卫生运动，大搞各种创作和发展文艺活动等等方面，也都订了令人兴奋的计划。
    六，公社便于加速进行城市建设工作
    人民公社是政社合一的社会基层组织，可以调动各方面的积极因素，在省、市的统一规划下，多快好省地进行全社的规划和建设。如旧城市的改造问题，公用事业的合理布局和使用问题，居民点、商业网、生活福利网以及卫星城镇的布置等问题均可在统一安排下，集中力量，予以解决。
    总之，城市人民公社的好处是说不完的。一年多来的无数事实证明，它是总路线和大跃进的必然产物。在它的发展过程中，社会生产力又更进一步地解放了，人民共产主义觉悟高涨了，这又证明在将来它是从社会主义过渡到共产主义社会的最好组织形式。广大职工农民和街道居民对公社表示无限热爱，他们歌颂毛主席和人民公社说：“毛主席搭上幸福台，劳动人民走上来，山在水在石头在，穷苦一去不再来”。我们决心做一个好社员，为公社的繁荣发展，为高速度进行祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗，我们不禁高呼城市人民公社万岁！
