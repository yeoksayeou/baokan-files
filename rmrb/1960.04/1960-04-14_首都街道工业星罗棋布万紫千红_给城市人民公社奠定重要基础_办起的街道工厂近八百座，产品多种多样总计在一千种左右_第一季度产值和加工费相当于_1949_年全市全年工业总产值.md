    Street Industries in the Capital are Dotted Like Stars, a Riot of Color
    Laying an Important Foundation for Urban People's Communes
    Nearly 800 Street Factories Established, Products are Diverse, Totaling Around 1,000 Varieties
    Output Value and Processing Fees in the First Quarter Equivalent to the Total Industrial Output Value of the City in 1949
    (Our Dispatch) Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the capital's newly emerging street industries are advancing at an extraordinarily rapid pace. They have become an important new force in Beijing's socialist construction and a vital foundation for urban people's communes.
    Currently, street industries in Beijing are dotted like stars and are a riot of color, distributed throughout the streets and alleys. In the past year or so, the city has successively established 796 street factories and 3,511 production groups. Of the 330,000 unemployed street residents in the city aged 16 to 60, 75% have now been organized, with 210,000 participating in industrial production. The variety of products from street industries is diverse, like a hundred flowers blooming, totaling around 1,000 varieties. These products not only include hairpins, shoes, hats, specialty crafts, etc., but also relatively advanced products such as instruments, electrical equipment, and glassware. The output value and processing fees of street industries in the first quarter of this year reached 170 million yuan, which is more than 50 million yuan more than the entire previous year, equivalent to the total industrial output value of Beijing in 1949.
    Street industries are increasingly demonstrating that they are an important force in socialist construction. First, they powerfully support large factories by processing for them and producing certain materials and tools, becoming a strong assistant to large factories. According to statistics from January to September last year, 15 factories and 105 production groups in the Erlong Road People's Commune in Xicheng District processed 133 types of products for state-owned industries out of 185 total products, including welding rods and springs. Since the beginning of this year, street factories have also accepted the production tasks of a batch of products delegated by state-owned industries, enabling large industries to free up their hands to produce more advanced products. The Chunshu People's Commune Chemical Factory in Xuanwu District undertook the production of all Er Dye (ear dye) originally produced by the Xinghua Dye Factory, allowing the Xinghua Dye Factory to switch to producing high-grade dyes, increasing the output value by tenfold compared to producing ear dye. Second, street industries produce many daily necessities, increasing the output and variety of light industry in the city. In the Beixinqiao People's Commune, 11 street factories produce 54 kinds of daily necessities, such as clothing, shoes, socks, sweaters, gloves, and headscarves, with an annual output value of more than 1 million yuan. Among them, a shoe factory processes 160,000 pairs of shoes a year, and a chemical factory produces laundry detergent and scrubbing soap that are sold in 37 cities and counties across the country. Third, many street industries in the city use scraps and waste materials from large factories for production, turning many "useless" items into "useful" materials. The Xinjiekou Hardware Smelting Factory selects raw materials from the waste piles of large factories, producing more than 35,000 kilograms of copper and 9,800 kilograms of aluminum for the country last year. The Anding Knitting Factory takes discarded nylon socks woven by large factories, unravels them, and reweaves them, resulting in good quality. The development of street industries has accelerated the pace of overall industrial development.
    With the development of production, hundreds of thousands of housewives have been liberated from their small families, rapidly changing their original mental outlook. People who used to be entangled in trivial household matters and concerned about the daily necessities of their own families now have a brand-new world in their lives. Their horizons have broadened, and they are also concerned about production, politics, and the collective. Their desire to make progress is as eager as someone who is hungry or thirsty. Glorious labor and mutual assistance have become new social customs. Zhao Shuzhen of the West Chang'an Street Leather Shoe Factory is a representative of this new custom. She is never afraid of getting dirty or tired in production. In winter, when the wind is strong, she is afraid of accidents at the factory and takes the initiative to be on duty; in summer, when it rains heavily, she is afraid that the leather stored in the basement will be soaked by water, so she braves the heavy rain to clear the drainage ditches. When her companions in the factory are sick, she always takes time out of her rest to visit them. When others encounter difficult tasks, she helps them overcome the difficulties. After participating in production, housewives are eager to improve their political, technical, and cultural levels. In the Chunshu People's Commune, more than 200 people are now participating in Party classes, and more than 1,100 young and middle-aged women are participating in cultural study classes. In this huge transformation, a large number of housewives are rapidly growing. According to statistics from the Beixinqiao People's Commune, 303 people were named advanced producers last year, and 324 women became factory directors, workshop directors, and production team leaders. In the city's industrial and other four fronts heroes meeting held in February this year, there were more than 300 representatives from street industries.
    Beijing's street industries were established after May and June 1958, relying on the broad masses of people to start from scratch, working hard, and relying on their own efforts. If there were no houses, the masses participating in production would automatically give up their homes; if there were no tools, they would pool together a pair of pliers and a hammer, and many people would voluntarily take less or no wages for several months in order to expand accumulation. When the Erlong Road Comprehensive Processing Factory was established, it only had a dozen people, two and a half rooms, one table, two benches, and more than 100 yuan borrowed; however, after a year of hard work, it now has 14 kinds of simple machine tools and equipment such as lathes, planers, vertical milling machines, spring hammers, and threading machines, becoming a larger factory with 505 people. Large industries have also provided them with a lot of assistance in technical guidance, technical training, and equipment supply.
    Beijing's street industries are developing rapidly, constantly improving their technical and management levels. Like large industries, many street industries have been continuously carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation movements for the past year, enabling the factory's technical equipment and production capacity to be rapidly improved. The Jianguomen Gold Lacquer Inlay Factory in Dongcheng District originally only had some simple hand tools. After the women broke superstitions and worked hard, they created seven kinds of 14 machines and equipment, arming themselves and realizing the mechanization of four of the five heavy manual labor tasks in the factory. In the past year, not only has the factory's output increased month by month, but it has also increased from being able to do only three simple processes and seven kinds of products to being able to do seven processes and 84 kinds of products. The Chaowai Street Switch Factory received strong support from the Municipal Switch Factory. Three experienced masters came to guide them, and in just five or six days, they learned the production of four kinds of auxiliary switches and the assembly technology of a wiring terminal. Since its establishment, the Erlong Road Spray Paint Factory has gradually established quality inspection and other systems, prompting production personnel to pay more attention to the development of production. They were responsible for the spray painting of many chairs in the Great Hall of the People, making the products both beautiful and durable.

    首都街道工业星罗棋布万紫千红
    给城市人民公社奠定重要基础
    办起的街道工厂近八百座，产品多种多样总计在一千种左右
    第一季度产值和加工费相当于1949年全市全年工业总产值
    本报讯　在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉照耀下，首都新兴的街道工业以特大的跃进速度向前飞奔。它已经成为北京社会主义建设中的一支重要的生力军，和城市人民公社的重要基础。
    现在，北京市的街道工业星罗棋布，万紫千红，分布在大街小巷。在过去一年多的时间中，全市已先后办起七百九十六座街道工厂，三千五百十一个生产组。全市十六岁到六十岁没有职业的街道居民原来共有三十三万人，现在75％已经组织起来，其中参加工业生产的就有二十一万人。街道工业的产品品种多样，好像百花盛开，总计在一千种左右。产品中不仅有发卡、鞋帽、特种工艺等，而且有仪器仪表、电器设备、玻璃制品等相当高级的产品。街道工业的产值和加工费，今年第一季度就有一亿七千万元，比去年全年还多五千多万元，相当于1949年北京全市全年工业总产值。
    街道工业日益显示出它是社会主义建设中的一支重要力量。第一，它通过为大厂加工，为大厂生产某些材料和工具设备等，有力地支援了大厂，成为大厂的有力助手。西城区二龙路人民公社十五个工厂、一百零五个生产组，据去年1至9月的统计，在一百八十五种产品中，为国营工业加工的就有焊条、弹簧等一百三十三种。今年以来，街道工厂还接受了国营工业下放的一批产品的生产任务，使大工业能够腾出手来生产更高级的产品。宣武区椿树人民公社化工厂承制了原来兴华染料厂生产的全部爱耳染色，兴华染料厂就转而生产高级染料，产值可以比生产染色的时候增加十倍半。第二，街道工业生产不少日用品，为全市轻工业增加了产量和品种。在北新桥人民公社，有十一个街道工厂生产着服装、鞋袜、毛衣、手套、头巾等五十四种生活日用品，年产值达一百多万元。其中一家制鞋厂加工的鞋一年就有十六万双，一家化工厂生产的洗衣粉、擦皂行销全国三十七个市、县。第三，全市许多街道工业利用大厂的下脚料和废旧物资进行生产，使许多“无用”之物变成了“有用”的材料。新街口五金熔炼厂就是从大工厂的废料堆里挑选原料，去年一年为国家生产了三万五千多公斤铜和九千八百多公斤铝。安定针织厂把大厂织的尼龙袜子废品拿来，拆了重织，质量很好。街道工业的发展，加快了整个工业发展的速度。
    随着生产的发展，几十万家庭妇女从小家庭中解放出来，迅速地改变着原来的精神面貌。过去缠身于生活琐事、关心一家一户柴米油盐的人，现在生活中出现了崭新的天地，眼界开阔了，她们也关心生产、关心政治、关心集体了，要求进步的心情如饥如渴。劳动光荣，团结互助成为新的社会风尚。西长安街皮鞋厂的赵淑珍就是这种新风尚的一个代表。她在生产上从来不怕脏，不嫌累。冬天刮大风，她怕厂子发生意外，就主动在厂内值班；夏天下大雨，她怕贮存在地下室的皮子被水浸湿，就冒着倾盆大雨，去打水沟眼。厂子里同伴们病了，她总要抽出休息时间去探望。别人碰到难做的活，她就去帮助克服困难。家庭妇女在参加了生产以后，迫切地要求提高政治、技术、文化水平。椿树人民公社现在参加党课学习的有二百多人，有一千一百多名青壮年妇女参加了文化学习班。在这个巨大的变革中，大批家庭妇女迅速地成长起来。据北新桥人民公社的统计，去年有三百零三人被评为先进生产者，有三百二十四个妇女当了厂长、车间主任和生产组长。今年2月举行的全市工业等四个战线群英会中，街道工业的代表就有三百多人。
    北京的街道工业是在1958年5、6月以后，依靠广大群众白手起家，穷干苦干、自力更生办起来的。没有房子、参加生产的群众自动让住房；没有工具，就你一把钳子、我一把锤子往一起集，而且许多人是几个月自动少拿、不拿工资，以便扩大积累。二龙路综合加工厂开办的时候，只有十几个人、两间半房子、一张桌子、两个板凳和借来的一百多块钱；但是经过一年的艰苦奋斗，现在已经有了车床、龙门刨、立铣、夹板锤、套丝机等十四种简易机床和设备，成为五百零五人的较大的工厂了。大工业也在技术指导、技工培训、设备供应等方面，给予了它们很多帮助。
    北京的街道工业在飞速地向前发展中，不断地提高技术和管理水平。许多街道工业与大工业一样，一年来持续不断地开展着技术革命和技术革新运动，使得工厂的技术装备和生产能力，得到迅速的提高。东城区建国门金漆镶嵌厂原先只有一些简陋手工工具，经过妇女们破除迷信、刻苦钻研，创造了七种十四台机器设备，武装了自己，使全厂五项笨重体力劳动有四项实现了机械化。这个厂一年来不仅产量月月上升，并且从开始只能做三道简单工序七种产品，提高到能做七道工序八十四种产品。朝外大街开关厂，得到市开关厂的大力支持，三个老师傅前来指导，只用了五、六天的时间，就学会了四种辅助开关的生产和一个接线端子的组装技术。二龙路喷漆工厂从建立以后，逐步建立了质量检查等制度，促使生产人员更加关心生产的发展，人民大会堂里的许多椅子的喷漆任务，就是他们做的，使制品既美观，又牢固。
