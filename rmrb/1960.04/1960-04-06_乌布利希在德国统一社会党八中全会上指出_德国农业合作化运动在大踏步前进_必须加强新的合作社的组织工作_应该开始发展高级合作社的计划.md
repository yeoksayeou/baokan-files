Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 3rd. The Berlin democratic district newspapers published on April 1st the report made by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee held from March 30th to April 1st. The title of the report was: "The Socialist Countries Strive for Abundant Agricultural Products and the German Democratic Republic Strives to Increase the Commodity Production of Agricultural Production Cooperatives."

Ulbricht pointed out in the report that the task of this plenary session was to analyze the experience gained in agriculture so far and to decide on the future policy of the German Democratic Republic in agriculture.

When talking about the significance of the German Democratic Republic's great victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, Ulbricht pointed out that in the German Democratic Republic, Lenin's cooperative plan had been correctly implemented, and the peasants had been freed from capitalist exploitation. The peasant class, which was exploited in capitalist Germany, has now become cooperative farmers. He said that the fact that all farmers have changed from individual production to cooperative production shows that they now understand that further development in rural areas is only possible through modern large-scale production.

Ulbricht pointed out that the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement appeared before the summit meeting, which was a very good thing, because it powerfully demonstrated the farmers' desire for lasting peace. In this way, with the help of the working class, they have strengthened the power of the German Democratic Republic, which is a bastion of peace.

When talking about why the great leap forward in the agricultural cooperation movement appeared at this time, Ulbricht pointed out that this was because:

　　Cooperatives can adopt modern scientific methods on large tracts of land and obtain much higher yields than individual farmers;

　　The farmers themselves realized that the power of the small-scale peasant economy is limited; West Germany's atomic armament and the collapse of the small-scale peasant economy convinced the farmers of the German Democratic Republic that the German Democratic Republic must be strengthened and the superiority of socialist farming methods must be proven in order to guarantee peace and the peaceful and democratic development of Germany.

Ulbricht said that this year's spring planting is the first cooperative production for many agricultural production cooperatives, which must be arranged very carefully. Workers and intellectuals who have made excellent achievements in organizing new cooperatives must now do more work to help farmers with spring planting and take advantage of the benefits of socialist large-scale production. He reminded people that the participation of almost all farmers in cooperatives is a big step forward. As long as the work is done well, the 1960 planned targets can be overfulfilled, laying the foundation for the early completion of the seven-year plan.

When talking about the benefits of agricultural production in a cooperative manner, Ulbricht said that cooperative production has higher yields, smaller agricultural production cooperatives can gradually merge into larger units, more rational large-scale farming can be carried out, and they can move towards specialization. Large-scale farming encourages members of agricultural production cooperatives to receive more training, learn more farming knowledge, or specialize more fully, and social and cultural life can be developed more easily.

Ulbricht said that the meeting of representatives from European socialist countries' communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in February this year to exchange experience in developing agriculture confirmed that socialist countries now have the ability to have a surplus of food. The German Democratic Republic stipulates that by 1963, it should produce enough meat, fat, milk and eggs for domestic consumption. This means that the German Democratic Republic will have to surpass West Germany and reach the world's most advanced level in livestock breeding.

The reporter said that it is now necessary to strengthen the organizational work of the new cooperatives and to make the members highly socialist conscious. This work must be carried out patiently and with care, and the committees of agricultural production cooperatives should be good at guiding the members and avoid coercion and commandism.

The reporter pointed out that organizing cooperatives is only the first step in achieving socialist victory in agriculture, and the next step is to organize socialist large-scale production. This requires huge efforts from the construction industry, agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, chemical industry and food industry. Only through the joint efforts of the working class and cooperative farmers can this task be accomplished.

Ulbricht said that machines will be handed over to the villages that have been fully cooperatized, and the strength of the machine tractor stations will be concentrated on repair work, because it is not yet possible to establish sufficient repair equipment in the cooperatives. Ulbricht suggested that plans to change the first type of cooperative into the third type (advanced) of cooperative should now begin, by increasing cooperative investment and starting to build large livestock sheds, etc.

When comparing the agricultural situation in the two Germanys, Ulbricht said that in West Germany, 1.4% of the land owners occupy 32% of the land, while 88% of the people only occupy 37% of the land. The situation in the German Democratic Republic shows that farmers can establish large-scale cooperative production units in a democratic manner without having to leave their families and farmland.

Ulbricht pointed out that improving the leadership of agricultural cooperatives is one of the most important conditions for developing production and educating cooperative farmers' collective consciousness, so that they have a high degree of socialist awareness. The movement to strive to become a "socialist labor team" is very important in both state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives. These labor teams are the center of promoting the adoption of progressive organizational methods and achieving the highest level of science and technology, as well as promoting internal democracy in cooperatives. Ulbricht said that a socialist mutual aid movement is also being carried out in agriculture to help backward teams and cooperatives.

Ulbricht pointed out that more attention must be paid to the work of women and young people. The rural areas that have been fully cooperatized need young people with high political qualities and technical skills. He said that those young people who used to engage in agricultural labor should be encouraged to return to work in the rural areas.

Ulbricht also said that the seven-year plan stipulates that by 1965, the total agricultural output should increase by 36% compared with 1958. The increase in production must be achieved with less labor and in a shorter time than at present. This can only be achieved by greatly improving labor productivity and the comprehensive development of large-scale socialist production in rural areas.

Ulbricht pointed out that a rich variety of vegetables and fruits must be provided. By the end of 1961, it should be possible to fully supply vegetables and fruits throughout the year. In 1963, the target for the number of dairy cows originally scheduled for 1965, namely 2.61 million, should be reached. By the end of 1960, 8.71 million pigs should be raised, and the feeding period should be shortened from eight months to seven months, and efforts should be made to reach the current international standards for pig raising: each worker should raise 4,000 to 5,000 fattening pigs. The number of hens should be increased to 8 million.

### 乌布利希在德国统一社会党八中全会上指出  德国农业合作化运动在大踏步前进  必须加强新的合作社的组织工作　应该开始发展高级合作社的计划

    乌布利希在德国统一社会党八中全会上指出
    德国农业合作化运动在大踏步前进
    必须加强新的合作社的组织工作　应该开始发展高级合作社的计划
    新华社柏林3日电　柏林民主区报纸1日刊登了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在3月30日到4月1日举行的党中央第八次全体会议上作的报告。报告的题目是：“社会主义各国为生产丰裕的农产品而奋斗和德意志民主共和国为提高农业生产合作社的商品生产而奋斗”。
    乌布利希在报告中指出，这次全会的任务是分析到现在为止在农业方面已经取得的经验，并且决定德意志民主共和国农业方面将来的政策。
    乌布利希在谈到德意志民主共和国在农业社会主义改造方面取得重大胜利的意义时指出，在德意志民主共和国，列宁的合作社计划已经正确地执行了，农民已经摆脱了资本主义的剥削。在资本主义德国被剥削的农民阶级，现在已经变成为合作农民。他说，全体农民从个体生产变为合作生产这一事实表明，他们现在已经了解，农村进一步的发展，只有通过现代化的大规模生产才有可能。
    乌布利希指出，农业合作化运动的大发展出现在最高级会议之前，这是一件非常好的事情，因为这有力地表明农民要求持久和平的愿望。这样，在工人阶级的帮助下，他们已经使作为和平堡垒的德意志民主共和国的力量增强起来。
    在谈到农业合作化运动的大踏步前进为什么在这个时候出现时，乌布利希指出，这是因为：
    合作社能够在大片土地上采用现代的科学方法，并且比个体农民获得高得多的产量；
    农民自己了解到，小农经济的力量是有限度的；西德的原子军备和小农经济的崩溃使德意志民主共和国农民相信，德意志民主共和国必须加强，社会主义耕作方法的优越性必须予以证明，以便保证和平及德国的和平和民主的发展。
    乌布利希说，今年的春播对很多农业生产合作社来说是第一次合作化的生产，这必须非常小心地加以安排。在组织新的合作社方面作出优良成绩的工人和知识分子，现在必须做更多的工作来帮助农民进行春播，并且利用社会主义大规模生产的优点。他提醒人们注意，差不多全体农民参加合作社，这是前进了一大步。只要工作做得好，1960年的计划指标就能超额完成，并为早日完成七年计划打下基础。
    乌布利希在谈到以合作方式进行农业生产的好处时说，合作化生产的产量更高，较小的农业生产合作社能够逐渐合并成为更大的单位，能够进行更合理的大规模耕作，并且走向专业化。大规模的耕作鼓励农业生产合作社社员接受更多的训练，学习更多的耕作知识，或者更充分地专业化，社会和文化生活能够更容易发展。
    乌布利希说，今年2月在莫斯科举行的欧洲社会主义国家共产党和工人党交流发展农业经验代表会议证实，社会主义国家现在有能力使粮食有剩余。德意志民主共和国规定，到1963年的时候，它应该生产足够国内消费的肉类、脂肪、牛奶和蛋类。这就是说，德意志民主共和国将必须超过西德，并且要在牲畜饲养方面达到世界最先进的水平。
    报告人说，现在有必要加强新的合作社的组织工作，并且使社员有很高的社会主义觉悟。这项工作必须耐心而关怀地进行，农业生产合作社委员会应该善于引导社员，而避免强迫命令。
    报告人指出，组织起合作社只是农业方面取得社会主义胜利的第一步，下一个步骤是组织社会主义大规模生产。这要求建筑工业、农业机器制造业、化学和食品工业作出巨大的努力。只有工人阶级和合作农民共同努力，这个任务才能实现。
    乌布利希说，机器将交给已经全部合作化的村庄，机器拖拉机站的力量将集中在修理工作方面，因为现在还不可能在合作社建立足够的修理设备。乌布利希建议，把第一类型的合作社改变为第三类型（高级）的合作社的计划现在应该开始，办法是增加合作社的投资，开始兴建大畜舍等。
    乌布利希在对比两个德国的农业情况时说，在西德，土地所有者中1.4％的人占有32％的土地，而88％的人却只占37％的土地。德意志民主共和国的情况表明，农民能够以民主的方式建立大规模的合作化的生产单位，而不需要离开他们的家庭和农田。
    乌布利希指出，改进农业合作社的领导，是发展生产和教育合作社农民集体观念，使他们有高度的社会主义觉悟的最重要的条件之一。争取成为“社会主义劳动队”运动，在国营农场和农业合作社中都非常重要。这些劳动队是推动采用进步的组织方法和达到最高的科学技术水平以及发扬合作社内部民主的中心。乌布利希说，在农业中也在开展社会主义互助运动，以便帮助落后的队和合作社。
    乌布利希指出，必须更多地注意妇女和青年工作。已经全部合作化的农村需要具备高度政治品质和技术熟练的青年人。他说，应该鼓励那些过去从事农业劳动的青年人回到农村工作。
    乌布利希还说，七年计划规定，到1965年，农业总产量要比1958年增加36％。必须用比目前更少的劳动力、更短的时间来实现增产。这只能通过大大地提高劳动生产率和农村大规模的社会主义生产的全面发展才能实现。
    乌布利希指出，必须提供丰富的多种多样的蔬菜和水果。1961年年底，应该做到在全年充分供应蔬菜和水果。1963年，应达到原定在1965年达到的乳牛头数的指标，即二百六十一万头。到1960年底应该养猪八百七十一万头，饲养期应该从八个月缩短到七个月，应该力求达到目前的养猪的国际标准：每个工作人员饲养四千至五千头肥猪。母鸡应当增加到八百万只。
