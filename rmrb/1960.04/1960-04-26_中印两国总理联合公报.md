Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th: Full text of the Joint Communiqué of the Prime Minister of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and the Prime Minister of the Republic of India:

    At the invitation of Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Delhi on April 19 to discuss certain differences that have arisen between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of India regarding border areas. Premier Zhou Enlai was accompanied by Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and other officials of the Chinese government. Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage concluded their visit to India on the morning of April 26.

    The two Prime Ministers held several long, frank and friendly talks. The Premier and Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China also held long talks with the President, Vice President and several senior ministers of the Indian government.

    The two Prime Ministers fully explained their respective positions on issues involving border areas. This led to a greater understanding of the views of the two governments, but these talks did not resolve the existing differences. The two Prime Ministers believe that officials from both sides should further review the factual material held by the two governments.

    Therefore, the two Prime Ministers agreed that officials of the two governments should meet to review, verify and study all historical documents, records, accounts, maps and other materials relating to the border issue used by each side to support its position, and prepare a report to be submitted to the two governments. This report will list the points of agreement, the points of disagreement, or the points that need fuller review and clarification. This report should help the two governments to further consider these issues.

    The two sides also agreed that officials should meet alternately in the capitals of the two countries from June to September 1960. The first meeting should be held in Beijing, and the officials will report to the two governments by the end of September 1960. While further reviewing the factual material, both sides should make every effort to avoid friction and conflict in the border areas.

    The two Prime Ministers took the opportunity of the meeting to discuss certain other important issues in international affairs. The two Prime Ministers welcomed the upcoming summit conference in Paris and expressed the hope that the conference would help to ease international tensions, prohibit the production and use of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament.

    中印两国总理联合公报
    新华社新德里25日电　中华人民共和国国务院总理和印度共和国总理联合公报，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来应印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生的邀请，于4月19日到达德里，商谈中华人民共和国政府和印度政府之间所发生的有关边境地区的某些分歧。陪同周恩来总理的有中华人民共和国副总理陈毅元帅、中国外交部副部长章汉夫和中国政府的其他官员。周恩来总理和他的随行人员于4月26日早晨结束了他们对印度的访问。
    两国总理举行了多次长时间的坦率和友好的会谈。中华人民共和国总理和副总理还同印度总统、副总统和印度政府的几位高级部长举行了长时间的会谈。
    两国总理充分地说明了各自在涉及边境地区的问题上的立场。这导致了对两国政府的观点的更大了解，但是这些会谈没有取得解决现存分歧的结果。两国总理认为，双方的官员应该进一步对两国政府所占有的事实材料进行审查。
    因此，两国总理同意，两国政府的官员应该会晤，审查、核对和研究各方用以支持其立场的有关边界问题的一切历史文件、记录、记述、地图和其他资料，并且拟出报告递交两国政府。这个报告将罗列一致的各点、不一致的各点或者需要更充分审查和澄清的各点。这个报告应该有助于两国政府对这些问题的进一步考虑。
    双方还同意，官员们应该从1960年6月至9月轮流在两国首都会晤。第一次会议应该在北京举行，官员们将在1960年9月底以前向两国政府报告。在进一步审查事实材料期间，双方应该作出一切努力来避免在边境地区发生摩擦和冲突。
    两国总理趁会晤的机会讨论了国际事务中的某些其他重要问题。两国总理欢迎即将在巴黎举行的政府首脑会议，并且表示希望这次会议将有助于和缓国际紧张局势、禁止核武器的生产和使用以及促进裁军。
