Xinhua News Agency, April 10th—The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party issued a communiqué on April 8th condemning the Greek government's persecution of Greek patriots.

    Referring to the recent trial in Athens of Greek patriots, the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party emphasized that the accused cadres of the Greek Communist Party were all vanguards in the fight against the Hitlerian conquerors and have been fighting for the interests of the Greek people since the Second World War.

    The communiqué condemned the Greek government's intention to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation. The communiqué said that the Karamanlis government, which pursues a cold war policy, is attempting to divert the Greek people's attention from pressing issues related to them and to hinder the unity of democratic forces. However, the Greek people know very well that when the Greek government takes such actions, it is attempting to implement its anti-popular and sinister plans.

    The communiqué said that the Greek government intends to sentence Greek patriots to death. The communiqué emphasized that the Greek people, as they have demonstrated in the Glezos case, will fight to save the fighters for freedom and will demand that the Greek Communist Party be legalized and that a general amnesty be granted.

    In its communiqué, the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party called on all Greek democrats to unite to repel the government's new offensive. The communiqué said that the Greek government is attacking the Greek Communist Party today, and tomorrow it may attack other political parties in order to continue to rule. Therefore, in order to save Greece, it is necessary to take action inside and outside Parliament.

    The communiqué emphasized that the Greek Communist Party will make every effort to form a government that is sufficient to ease tensions and achieve peace and domestic tranquility.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 11th—Athens dispatch: Manolis Glezos resolutely stated in the Athens Court of Appeals on April 10th, during the hearing of his appeal, that he was innocent of the charge of "espionage" brought against him by the authorities. Glezos said, "The only reason I was arrested and brought before a military tribunal is that I am the president of 'Avghi' newspaper and a leading member of the United Democratic Left party, that is, I am a political opponent of the government." Glezos said he wanted "to defend not only myself, but also the democracy of Greece."

    Glezos protested that he had been deprived of the possibility of appealing to the highest judicial authority in Greece after the verdict was issued by the military tribunal due to the unfair trial.

    Glezos said that he continues to be persecuted. He said, "The government has put me in a prison for common criminals and in a solitary cell for prisoners on death row. This shows what means the government is using to deal with its political opponents."

    Glezos emphasized that he will continue to fight for a just ruling and justice.

    Glezos was sentenced by the Athens Military Tribunal last July, on fabricated charges of so-called "espionage," to nine years of deprivation of freedom, including five years of imprisonment and four years of exile in a concentration camp, and eight years of deprivation of political rights.

    希共谴责政府反动政策
    号召民主人士起来援救爱国者
    格列索斯表示将为保卫民主正义继续斗争
    新华社10日讯　希腊共产党中央委员会8日发表公报，谴责希腊政府迫害希腊爱国者。
    希腊共产党中央委员会在谈到最近正在雅典进行的对希腊爱国者的审讯时强调指出，被控告的希腊共产党的干部都是反对希特勒征服者的先锋，在第二次世界大战以后又一直在为希腊人民的利益而斗争。
    公报谴责说，希腊政府打算阻挠国际局势缓和。公报说，奉行冷战政策的卡拉曼利斯政府，企图转移希腊人民对同他们有关的迫切问题的注意，并且阻碍民主力量的团结。然而希腊人民知道得很清楚，当希腊政府采取这种行动的时候，它是企图实行它的反人民的罪恶的计划。
    公报说，希腊政府打算把希腊爱国者判处死刑。公报强调说，但是希腊人民，正如他们在格列索斯案件中所表现的那样，将为拯救争取自由的战士而斗争，并且将要求让希腊共产党取得合法地位和实行大赦。
    希腊共产党中央委员会在公报中号召希腊所有的民主人士团结起来，来击退政府的新的进攻。公报说，希腊政府今天在打击希腊共产党，明天它就可能会打击别的政党，以便继续执政。因此，为了拯救希腊，在议会内外展开行动是必要的。
    公报强调说，希腊共产党将为组成一个足以缓和紧张局势、实现和平与国内安宁的政府而作一切努力。
    新华社11日讯　雅典消息：曼诺里斯·格列索斯10日在审理他的上诉书的雅典上诉法院中坚决声明说，在当局对他提出的“进行间谍活动”的控告面前，他是清白无罪的。格列索斯说，“我被逮捕和交付军事法庭审讯的唯一原因是，我是‘黎明日报’的社长和统一民主左翼党的领导成员，也就是说，我是政府的政治反对者。”格列索斯说，他想“维护的不仅是自己，而且也是希腊的民主”。
    格列索斯抗议说，由于不公正的审判，他被剥夺了在军事法庭作出判决后向希腊最高司法机关提出申诉的可能性。
    格列索斯说，目前他继续受到迫害。他说，“政府把我关在刑事犯的监狱和死刑犯的单人牢房中。这表明，政府采用何种手段来对付自己的政治反对者。”
    格列索斯着重说，他将为争取公正的裁决和正义继续进行斗争。
    格列索斯是在去年7月被雅典军事法庭以莫须有的所谓“进行间谍活动”的罪名，判决剥夺自由九年，其中徒刑五年，集中营流放四年；剥夺政治权利八年。
