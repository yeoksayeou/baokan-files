High-Speed Development of the Chemical Industry
Representative Lin Wenbiao Discusses Achievements in the Chemical Industry

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. I am immensely excited by the great victories and brilliant achievements our country has made on all fronts since the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958. Looking forward, I am even more inspired by the grand plan for the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1960 and filled with boundless confidence in this year's and the entire 1960s' sustained leap forward.

In the past two years, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and guided by the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, the development of China's chemical industry has been very rapid. In 1959, various chemical products increased significantly compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958: sulfuric acid increased by 48% to 51%, caustic soda by 33% to 34%, and synthetic ammonia by 40% to 42%. In terms of rubber products, conveyor belts increased by 90%, transmission belts by 84%, V-belts by 117%, and carbon black production more than doubled. Many products have reached or exceeded the 1962 targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan. While the output of products has increased at high speed, the quality of rubber products has also generally improved, with more than three thousand new varieties added, many of which are high-end, precise, cutting-edge, new, and large products that are now in full production.

In the first quarter of this year, we broke the unreasonable convention of previous years where the beginning of the year was lower than the end of the previous year and achieved a comprehensive "good start, complete success," victoriously achieving the great accomplishment of exceeding the first quarter's national plan. Major chemical products have greatly exceeded the original plan, with rubber products increasing by more than 10% to 20%. Currently, the great, nationwide mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has brought about earth-shaking changes in the appearance of chemical industrial enterprises, production, and the mental outlook of the workforce. An extremely positive situation of rapid change and progress has emerged in the national chemical industry. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" in chemical industrial enterprises has swept through various chemical industries since the beginning of last winter.

In the past three months, the rubber industry has undergone tremendous changes. First, the level of mechanization has rapidly increased. Now, every rubber enterprise has hundreds or thousands of projects that have achieved semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation. Automated production lines and linked lines are abundant in workshops. Due to the large-scale implementation of "four modernizations," the degree of mechanization in the national rubber industry has rapidly increased from 51.7% last year to 72%, and it is still continuing to rise. For example, Chongqing Zhongnan Rubber Factory was originally a small factory with a high degree of manual labor, with manual operations accounting for 80%. After a month of hard work by the entire factory's workforce, it leapt to a mechanization level of 80%, achieving fifty-three major technical innovations and twelve automated production lines, with labor productivity more than doubling compared to last year. Now, many power workshops have begun to implement unmanned management, and the automation of production workshops and the entire production process is also being gradually realized.

Significant achievements have also been made in improving product quality, saving raw materials, and adopting substitute materials. This year, the synthetic rubber industry is developing rapidly, and rubber products need to use large quantities of synthetic rubber. As a result of technical revolutions in raw materials, the quality has not only not decreased but has also improved. After styrene-butadiene rubber is mixed into tires, the quality maintains the level of natural rubber. The technical innovation achievements in using plastics and reclaimed rubber as rubber substitutes are also very prominent.

The in-depth development of the technical revolution has led to the creation of more high-end, large, precise, and cutting-edge new products. These new products have been successfully trial-produced in a very short period of time and have significant implications for the national economy. Rubber oil tanks for trains and automobiles are not only lightweight and save a large amount of steel but also easy to load and unload, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of empty return trips. Rubber springs for trains and automobiles can save a large amount of spring steel for each vehicle and improve the smoothness of the vehicle and riding comfort.

While conducting technical revolutions in production, technology, design, and equipment, many major technical innovations have also been carried out in enterprise management, increasing work efficiency several times over. The automatic production management line – four rings and one line – created in Harbin and Tianjin, can know the completion of tasks every hour and report output and existing problems on time, which is a major revolution in management work. In addition, wage slide rules, calculators, and quick calculators for quotas, raw materials, and equipment capacity have been created in various places, greatly simplifying business procedures and making it easier for workers to participate in comprehensive management through "two participations, one reform, and three combinations."

In this great movement, the mental outlook of the people has also undergone profound changes. The broad masses have greatly emancipated their minds, brought their wisdom into full play, overcome difficulties, tackled cutting-edge technologies, and created miracles. The broad masses have carried forward the communist spirit of great collaboration and collectivism. If one person or one unit has difficulties, everyone helps. They innovate themselves and also help others innovate. This strong revolutionary will and lofty revolutionary spirit are the result of implementing political command and launching mass movements.

The most fundamental reason why the movement has been able to achieve such great achievements, on such a large scale, at such a fast speed, with such a rapid momentum, and with such abundant revolutionary enthusiasm among the people is that we have the leadership of our great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we have correctly implemented the general line for socialist construction, finding a new path for developing science and technology in a more, faster, better, and more economical way in terms of technical innovation and technical revolution. This once again proves the unparalleled greatness and correctness of the Communist Party. With the leadership of the Party, we can overcome any difficulties and will surely win high speed and build socialism at an early date.

    高速度发展化学工业
    林文彪代表谈化学工业的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理所作的报告。我国自1958年以来在各个战线上连续大跃进所取得的伟大胜利和辉煌成就，我感到无比的兴奋；瞻望未来，对于1960年国民经济继续大跃进的宏伟计划，更为振奋，对今年以及整个六十年代的持续跃进充满着无限信心。
    两年来，在党中央、毛主席的直接领导和党的社会主义建设总路线及一整套“两条腿走路”方针的指导下，我国化学工业的发展非常迅速。1959年，各种化工产品比大跃进的1958年又有了很大增长，硫酸增长48％至51％，烧碱增长33％至34％，合成氨增长40％至42％；在橡胶制品方面，运输带增加了90％，传动带84％，三角带117％，炭黑产量翻了一番多；好多产品都已达到或超过了第二个五年计划规定的1962年指标。在产品产量高速度增长的同时，橡胶产品质量也普遍提高，增加的新品种有三千种以上，许多属于高、精、尖、新、大的产品现在全生产了。
    今年第一季度，又大破已往年初低于上年末的不合理常规，全面实现了“开门红、满堂红”，并胜利地取得了超额完成第一季国家计划的伟大成绩。主要化工产品都大大超过了原定计划，其中橡胶制品增加10％至20％以上。目前，伟大的、全民性的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，已经使化学工业的企业面貌、生产面貌和职工群众的精神面貌，起了翻天复地的变化，全国化学工业出现了日新月异，一日千里的极好形势。化学工业企业以“四化”为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，从去年入冬以来，迅速席卷化工各个行业。
    三个多月来，橡胶工业已经发生了巨大变化。首先是机械化水平迅速提高，现在每一个橡胶企业都有成百上千的项目实现了半机械化、机械化和半自动化、自动化，出现的生产自动线和联动线更是满布车间。由于“四化”的大量实现，全国橡胶工业的机械化程度已由去年的51.7％，飞速上升为72％，而且现在还在继续上涨。如重庆中南橡胶厂原来是一个手工业性很大的小厂，原有手工操作占80％，经过全厂职
  工一个月的奋战，一跃而为机械化程度80％，实现了五十三项重大技术革新、十二条生产
  自动线，劳动生产率比去年翻了一倍半。现在不少动力车间都已开始实行无人管理，生产车间和整个生产过程的自动化也在陆续实现。
    在提高产品质量、节约原材料和采用代用物质等方面，也有了显著成绩。今年合成橡胶工业大发展，橡胶制品要使用多量的合成橡胶，由于在原料上进行技术革命的结果，质量不仅没有降低而且还有所提高。轮胎掺用丁苯橡胶以后，质量保持了天然胶的水平。在采用塑料、再生胶做为橡胶代用材料方面的技术革新成果也十分突出。
    技术革命的深入发展，导致了创造更多的高、大、精、尖的新产品。这些新产品都是在很短的时间内试制成功的，对国民经济具有重大的意义。火车、汽车用的橡胶油槽，不仅轻便且能节约大量钢材，而且便于装卸，从根本上消灭了运输返空现象。火车橡胶弹簧与汽车橡胶弹簧每辆车可以节约大量弹簧钢，并能提高车辆的平顺性，乘坐舒适。
    在生产、工艺、设计、设备进行技术革命的同时，企业管理方面，也进行了许多重大的技术革新，使工作效率成几倍地提高。哈尔滨和天津等地创造的生产自动管理线——四环一线，每个小时都能知道任务的完成情况，按时报告产量和存在问题，这是管理工作的大革命。此外，各地还创制了工资速算尺，速算器，定额消耗，原材料及设备能力速算器等，大大简化了业务手续，更便于“两参一改三结合”工人参加全面管理。
    在这个伟大的运动中，人们的精神面貌，也发生了深刻的变化，广大群众思想大解放、智慧大发扬、大破难关、大攻尖端、大创奇迹。广大群众发扬共产主义大协作和集体主义精神，一个人、一个单位有困难，大家来帮，自己闹革新还帮助了别人来革新。这种坚强的革命意志和崇高革命精神是实行政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。
    运动之所以能够取得这样伟大的成就，规模如此之大，速度如此之快，来势这样迅猛，人们的革命干劲这样充沛，最根本的一条就是有了我们伟大的共产党和毛主席的领导，正确地贯彻了社会主义建设总路线，在技术革新和技术革命方面找到了一条多快好省发展科学技术的新道路。这又一次地证明了共产党的无比伟大和正确。有了党的领导，我们任何困难都能克服，一定能够赢得高速度，早日建成社会主义。
