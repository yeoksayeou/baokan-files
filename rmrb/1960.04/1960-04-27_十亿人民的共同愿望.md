    The visit of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and his entourage to India ended on April 26th. On the previous day, the premiers of China and India issued a joint communiqué. During this visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held multiple and lengthy talks with Prime Minister Nehru on issues of common concern, particularly the Sino-Indian border issue. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu also met separately with several Indian government ministers for frank discussions. The joint communiqué pointed out that these talks allowed both sides to fully explain their respective positions on issues related to the border areas, leading to a greater understanding of the views of the two governments. After seven days of talks, although no agreement was reached on resolving the border issue, both sides agreed that officials from the two governments would meet to review, verify, and study factual materials related to the border issue and submit a report to the two governments. Both sides also agreed that, while further reviewing the factual materials, all efforts should be made to avoid friction and conflict in the border areas. These results of the meeting between the Chinese and Indian premiers are of positive significance for maintaining tranquility on the border and continuing to seek a reasonable way to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue.
    The Chinese government has consistently advocated a meeting between the premiers of the two countries to reasonably resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultation. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India at the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru was made with the sincere desire to resolve the issue. During his visit to New Delhi, Premier Zhou Enlai repeatedly expressed the friendly wishes of the Chinese government and people. On April 20th, Premier Zhou Enlai said at a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Nehru: In our view, the border issue between our two countries is merely a local and temporary issue compared to the fundamental issue of maintaining friendly cooperation between the two countries, and in popular Chinese terms, it is a matter of one finger versus nine fingers. He then stated, "The Chinese government and I personally firmly believe that as long as we consider the long-term interests of friendship between the two countries in all aspects, taking into account both the historical background and the current actual situation, and based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, a fair, reasonable, and comprehensive solution to the border issue can be found. The Sino-Indian border issue is a legacy of history and was not created by our two governments. The Chinese government especially does not want to see the border issue affect relations between the two countries. In order to seek various ways to peacefully resolve the border issue, the Chinese government has never hesitated to make its utmost efforts. I sincerely hope that this meeting between the premiers of the two countries can produce positive and beneficial results." All of Premier Zhou Enlai's activities and statements during his visit to India fully expressed the warm friendship of the more than six hundred million Chinese people towards the great Indian people, and also fully expressed the Chinese government's reasonable and conciliatory position on the Sino-Indian border dispute. This is undoubtedly a great contribution to the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and a great blow to the international reactionary forces that are viciously trying to sow discord between the two peoples.
    Although the meeting between the two premiers did not reach an agreement on the resolution of the border issue, as Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, it is not impossible to find common ground or points of convergence on the Sino-Indian border issue. Premier Zhou Enlai believed that it could be roughly summarized into the following six points:
    First, there are disputes on both sides of the border.
    Second, there exists a line of actual control between the two countries, which is within the administrative jurisdiction of each side.
    Third, in determining the boundaries of the two countries, certain geographical principles, such as watersheds, valleys, and passes, should apply equally to all sections of the border.
    Fourth, the resolution of the border issue between the two countries should take into account the national sentiments of the people of both countries towards the Himalayas and the Karakoram Mountains.
    Fifth, before the border issue between the two countries is resolved through negotiation, both sides should abide by the line of actual control and not put forward territorial claims as a precondition, but individual adjustments can be made.
    Sixth, in order to ensure tranquility on the border and facilitate the negotiation process, both sides should continue to cease patrolling in all sections of the border.
    People see that among these six points, the first and second points are objective facts that exist and cannot be denied by anyone. As long as both sides recognize these facts and reach a consensus, it will provide a favorable premise for a reasonable resolution of the border issue. The third and fourth points belong to the principles for dealing with the border issue. These principles are obviously completely reasonable, and the Indian side has repeatedly emphasized the geographical principles in certain situations. Therefore, there should be no difficulty in reaching a consensus on these principles. As for the fifth and sixth points, they are necessary measures to be taken by both sides before the border issue is resolved, and they are also reasonable and appropriate. The Indian side has also advocated in the past that individual adjustments to the border can be made and advocated ceasing patrols in the eastern sector, which is close to the fifth and sixth points. It can be seen that the meeting between the two premiers should have been able to reach an agreement on these basically common or close six points, thus greatly advancing the Sino-Indian border issue towards a comprehensive and reasonable resolution. During the talks, the Indian side still had some distance from the Chinese side on the above-mentioned issues, and the Indian side did not agree to reach an agreement on these six points. Although this cannot but make the Chinese people and all those who care about Sino-Indian friendship feel regret, as the two governments and the two peoples continue to make unremitting efforts for a reasonable and friendly solution to the border issue between the two countries, the satisfactory resolution of this issue that the two peoples are looking forward to will surely be realized one day.
    The meeting between the Chinese and Indian premiers was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Indian people. Like the Chinese people, they hoped that this meeting would help resolve the border issue between the two countries and consolidate their friendship. However, the imperialist and reactionary forces in India who are trying to undermine Sino-Indian friendship held an undisguised hostile attitude towards this meeting. From the very beginning when Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a meeting between the Chinese and Indian premiers, they tried every possible means to undermine the meeting. They openly demanded "maintaining a state of tension for a long time" to achieve their ulterior motives. After Premier Zhou Enlai arrived in New Delhi, the imperialist and Indian reactionary forces even carried out rampant activities against the Indian government's adoption of a policy of reconciliation. The Washington "Star Evening News" even incited, "India's firm resistance will boost the morale of all its neighboring countries. For Mr. Nehru's leadership position in his own country and India's position in Asia in the future, it is very important that New Delhi does not show any leniency towards guests from Beijing." They brazenly put pressure on the talks, demanding unilateral concessions from China, and even demanding that China give up its own territory as a prerequisite for negotiations. They maliciously spread a pessimistic atmosphere about the talks, even saying, "Not only today, but even for many generations to come, it will be impossible to reach any solution between China and India." They attempted to undermine the deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples in this way. However, it was not others who failed, but the imperialist and Indian reactionary forces themselves. All the attempts of the imperialist and Indian reactionary forces to impose their arrogant demands on China have not succeeded, and will never succeed. Their plot to undermine the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples is now more clearly exposed to the Indian people and the people of all countries in the world. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India once again shows that only a very small number of imperialist elements with ulterior motives and right-wing elements in India who oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are against Sino-Indian friendship, while the broad masses of the Indian people are friendly to China. The great friendship of the one billion Chinese and Indian people is a friendship that no force in the world can undermine or shake.
    The border issue between China and India is a complex issue left over from history. Since there are still differences in the views of both sides on the border issue, it is impossible not to encounter some difficulties in the process of seeking a solution. However, we have always believed that even if this issue has not been resolved temporarily, it should not and cannot shake the foundation of the long-standing friendship between our two peoples.
    In the long years of the past, the Chinese and Indian peoples have always lived in harmony, and have never been hostile or invaded each other. In the longer years to come, our two peoples will continue to be friendly, and will certainly continue to be friendly. The governments of China and India jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We should become models for implementing the Five Principles and become models for unity and friendship among Asian countries. In a written statement issued after the meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai announced that the Chinese government still maintains that, since the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, the two sides should consider the historical background and current actual situation, and based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two countries, adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, and continue to seek a reasonable solution to the border issue through friendly consultation. Before this, both sides should maintain the status quo and not change the status quo with any unilateral actions. For some disputes, temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations. Premier Zhou Enlai also stated, "The Chinese government has unwavering confidence in resolving the Sino-Indian border issue and strengthening the friendship between the two countries, and will make unremitting efforts for this purpose."
    China and India are both independent countries that have not long been freed from imperialist oppression, and we both face the arduous task of developing our national economies. The Chinese people are concentrating all their energy on building our motherland and quickly overcoming economic and cultural backwardness. We are determined to build our country well and hope that our friendly neighbor India can also prosper and become strong soon. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between us. Although our two countries have different social systems and paths of economic development, we need to learn from each other, encourage each other, and cooperate with each other on many issues. China and India are both peace-loving countries. The unity of the one billion Chinese and Indian people has been, is, and will be a great force for maintaining world peace. The common interests of the Chinese and Indian peoples require us to make greater contributions to the cause of world peace and progress in the new era. The great Indian poet Tagore said in 1924: "The friendship and unity of China and India are the cornerstones of struggling Asia." Tagore's words still make us feel very close today. We firmly believe that the differences between China and India on the border issue will eventually be resolved reasonably, and the traditional brotherly friendship of the one billion Chinese and Indian people will eventually, through the joint efforts of the Chinese and Indian peoples, break through all evil clouds and radiate light illuminating all of Asia.

    十亿人民的共同愿望
    我国周恩来总理和他的随行人员已于4月26日结束了对印度的友好访问。在这前一天，中印两国总理发表了联合公报。周恩来总理在这次访问中，同尼赫鲁总理就共同关心的问题，特别是中印边界问题，进行了多次的长时间的会谈。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、章汉夫副部长还同印度政府的几位部长分别会晤，进行了坦率的讨论。联合公报指出，这些会谈使双方充分地说明了各自在涉及边境地区问题上的立场，导致了对两国政府的观点的更大了解。经过七天的会谈，虽然没有达成解决边界问题的协议，但是双方一致同意，由两国政府的官员会晤，审查、核对和研究有关边界问题的事实材料，向两国政府提出报告。双方还同意，在进一步审查事实材料期间，应该作出一切努力来避免在边境地区发生摩擦和冲突。中印两国总理这次会晤的这些结果，对于维护边界的安宁和继续寻找合理解决中印边界问题的途径，是具有积极意义的。
    中国政府一贯主张两国总理会晤，通过友好协商来合理解决中印边界问题。周恩来总理这次应尼赫鲁总理的邀请访问印度，就是抱着解决问题的真诚愿望而去的。周恩来总理在访问新德里期间曾经一再表达了中国政府和人民的这种友好的愿望。4月20日，周恩来总理在尼赫鲁总理举行的宴会上讲话时说：我们两国之间的边界问题，在我们看来，比之于维护两国友好合作的根本问题，仅仅是一个局部的暂时的问题，用中国通俗的语言来说，是一个指头和九个指头的问题。他接着表示，“中国政府和我本人深信，只要处处为两国友好的长远利益着想，既考虑到历史背景，又考虑到当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，互谅互让，两国边界问题是完全能够求得公平合理的全面解决的。中印边界问题是历史上遗留下来的，不是我们两国政府制造出来的。中国政府尤其不愿意看到两国边界问题影响到两国关系。为了寻求和平解决边界问题的各种途径，中国政府从不吝惜作出自己可能作出的最大努力。我衷心地希望两国总理这次的会晤能够产生积极的和有益的效果。”周恩来总理访问印度的全部活动和言论，充分地表达了中国六亿多人民对于伟大的印度人民的热烈友谊，也充分地表达了中国政府对于中印边界争端的合理的和解的立场。这对于中印两国人民的友好无疑是一个巨大的贡献，而对于那些恶毒挑拨两国人民友谊的国际反动势力则是一个巨大的打击。
    经过两国总理的这次会谈，虽然并没有就边界问题的解决达成协议，但是，正如周恩来总理所指出的，在中印边界问题上也并不是不可以找到共同点或者接近之点。周恩来总理认为，可以大致归纳为以下六点：
    一、双方边界存在着争议。
    二、在两国之间存在着一条各自行政管辖所及的实际控制线。
    三、在确定两国边界时，某些地理原则，如分水岭、水谷、山口等应该同样适用于边界各段。
    四、两国边界问题的解决应该照顾到两国人民对喜马拉雅山和喀喇昆仑山的民族感情。
    五、在两国边界问题经过商谈得到解决之前，双方应该各守实际控制线，不提出领土要求作为先决条件，但可进行个别调整。
    六、为了保证边界安宁、便于商谈的进行，双方在边界各段应该继续停止巡逻。
    人们看到，在这六点之中，第一点和第二点是客观上存在的任何人都无法否认的事实，只要双方都承认这些事实，取得一致看法，那就为合理解决边界问题提供有利的前提。第三点和第四点是属于处理边界问题的原则问题，这些原则显然是完全合理的，其中关于某些地理原则，还是印度方面在某些场合所一再强调的，因此就这些原则取得一致意见，也不应该有什么困难。至于第五点和第六点，是关于边界问题解决之前双方所采取的必要措施，也是合情合理的。印度方面过去也曾经主张可以进行边界的个别调整，并主张在东段停止巡逻，这与第五点和第六点是相接近的。由此可见，这次两国总理的会谈，本来完全应该和可能就这些基本上共同的或接近的六点达成协议，从而使中印边界问题向着全面合理解决大大迈进一步。在会谈中印度方面在上述这些问题上同中国方面还有距离，印度方面没有同意就这六点达成协议，这虽然不能不使中国人民和一切关心中印友好的人们感到惋惜，但是只要两国政府和两国人民继续为两国边界问题的合理的友好的解决作不懈的努力，两国人民所盼望的这一问题的圆满解决就必能有实现的一天。
    中印两国总理的会晤，受到印度广大人民的热烈欢迎。他们同中国人民一样，希望这次会晤会有助于两国边界问题的解决和两国友谊的巩固。但是帝国主义和印度的力图破坏中印友谊的反动势力却对这次会晤抱着露骨的敌视态度，他们从周恩来总理提出中印两国总理会晤的建议开始，就千方百计地竭力破坏这次会晤。他们公然要求“长期保持紧张状态”，以达到他们的不可告人的目的。周恩来总理到达新德里以后，帝国主义和印度反动势力更进行了猖狂的反对印度政府采取和解政策的活动。美国华盛顿“明星晚报”甚至煽动说，“印度的坚定抵抗会振作它的所有邻国的精神。对于尼赫鲁先生在本国的领导地位和印度今后在亚洲的地位来说，十分重要的是新德里不要对来自北平的客人有所姑息”。他们放肆地对会谈施加压力，要中国作单方面的让步，甚至要求以中国放弃自己的领土作为谈判的前提。他们恶毒地散布对于会谈的悲观空气，甚至说，“不仅在今天，而且甚至在今后许多世代，中国和印度之间都不可能达成任何解决办法。”他们企图这样来破坏中印两国人民的深厚的友谊。但是，失败的并不是别人，正是帝国主义和印度反动势力自己。帝国主义和印度反动势力企图把他们的狂妄主张强加于中国的一切作法都没有成功，而且也永远不会成功。他们妄想破坏中印两国人民的传统友谊的阴谋，现在是比任何时候更清楚地暴露在印度人民和世界各国人民的面前了。周恩来总理这次访印度又一次表明，反对中印友谊的只是极少数别有用心的帝国主义分子和印度的反对和平共处五项原则的右翼分子，而广大印度人民是对中国友好的。中印十亿人民的伟大友谊是世界上任何力量也破坏不了、动摇不了的。
    中印两国之间的边界问题是历史上遗留下来的一个复杂的问题，由于双方对于边界问题的看法仍然存在着距离，因此在谋求解决的过程中，不可能不遇到一些困难。但是，我们始终认为，即使这个问题暂时还没有得到解决，也不应该和不可能动摇我们两国人民悠久的友好的基础。
    在过去的长远的岁月里，中印两国人民一直是友好相处的，从来没有互相敌对和侵犯。在今后的更长远的岁月里，我们两国人民还要友好下去，而且一定会友好下去。中印两国政府共同倡导了五项原则，我们应该成为执行五项原则的模范，应该成为亚洲国家团结友好的模范。周恩来总理在会谈结束后发表的书面讲话中宣布，中国政府现在仍然主张，由于中印边界从未正式划定，中印双方应该考虑历史背景和当前实际情况，根据两国共同倡导的五项原则，采取互谅互让的态度，继续通过友好协商，来求得边界问题的合理解决。在此以前，双方应该维持现状，不以任何片面行动改变现状。对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判，达成临时性协议。周恩来总理并且表示，“中国政府对于解决中印边界问题和加强两国的友谊具有不可动摇的信心，并且将为此进行不懈的努力。”
    中国和印度都是摆脱帝国主义压迫还不久的独立国家，我们都面临发展民族经济的艰巨任务。中国人民正在集中全副精力来建设我们的祖国，迅速克服经济和文化的落后状态。我们决心把自己的国家建设好，也希望我们友好邻邦印度能够很快地繁荣富强起来。我们之间没有任何基本利益冲突。我们两国的社会制度和经济发展的道路虽然不同，但是我们在许多问题上都需要互相学习，互相鼓舞，互相合作。中国和印度都是爱好和平的国家。中印两国十亿人民的团结，过去、现在和将来都是维护世界和平的一支伟大力量。中印两国人民的共同利益，要求我们在新的年代里为世界和平和进步事业做出更大的贡献。印度大诗人泰戈尔在1924年就说过：“中国和印度的友好和团结是奋斗的亚洲的奠基石”。泰戈尔这句话至今仍使我们感到十分亲切。我们深信，中印两国之间关于边界问题的分歧终将获得合理的解决，中印两国十亿人民的传统的兄弟般的友谊，终将由于中印人民的共同努力，冲破一切邪恶的乌云，放射出照耀全亚洲的光芒。
