Comrades Deputies:
    We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    We would now like to express a few opinions on the development and future practices of the people's communes in the five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou.
    Like other parts of the country, our five major cities, based on the victorious ideological foundation of the nationwide rectification movement and inspired by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, have seen a Great Leap Forward in all areas of work. Due to the high-speed development of our socialist construction and the urgent need for more people to participate in various production and construction undertakings, and due to the greatly enhanced ideological awareness of the vast number of workers' families and street residents, they have a strong desire to quickly shake off our country's backwardness of being "poor and blank" and a strong demand to free themselves from household chores and participate in social labor. For these reasons, urban street industries have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. After the large-scale development of urban street industries, the people participating in production demanded the realization of collectivized life and the socialization of housework, and have already established various collective living welfare undertakings and service undertakings. In order to better organize the masses' production, life, and study, and to facilitate cooperation with large enterprises, there must be a good and suitable organizational form. Therefore, we began to pilot urban people's communes in 1958. More than a year of practice has proven that the organizational form of the people's commune is completely suitable for large cities, and like the rural people's communes, it has demonstrated its great superiority and is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. This is because:
    1. It has developed production. In the process of organizing, urban people's communes have established a large number of small and medium-sized factories. These factories are a new force on the industrial front, which can help large factories process parts, components, and semi-finished products. They can also use waste materials to produce various daily-use industrial products. Therefore, it has played a significant role in serving large factories, serving the lives of urban people, serving agricultural production, and meeting market needs. In terms of the production of street industries in our five major cities alone, they created nearly 800 million yuan in output value and processing fees during the one-year pilot period in 1959.
    2. It has developed collective living welfare undertakings, increased the income of the working people, and thus improved the people's lives. Over the past year or so, with the development of production, people's communes in various places have generally accumulated a considerable amount of capital. In addition to being used for expanding reproduction, the commune's accumulation has also been used to establish many collective living welfare undertakings, such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, bathhouses, homes for the elderly, and service stations. The establishment of these collective living welfare undertakings has greatly improved the people's material lives and is deeply loved by the masses. With the development of production, the personal income of commune members has also increased rapidly. The monthly wage in 1959 increased from more than ten yuan at the beginning to twenty or thirty yuan by the end of the year, and some even more.
    3. The establishment of urban people's communes has further strengthened cooperation between various departments. Before the establishment of the communes, street production organizations and living welfare organizations had already established cooperative relationships with various departments, but this cooperation was not systematic or regular. After the establishment of the communes, this cooperative relationship formed a more systematic and regular large-scale cooperation within a larger scope. The strengthening of cooperation has further promoted the development of production, improved the lives of workers and residents, and further enhanced people's communist consciousness.
    4. The establishment of urban people's communes has enabled the broad masses of women, especially housewives, to embark on the road to complete liberation. More than 90% of the employees of the commune were originally housewives. Once the labor force of housewives is liberated, they exert infinite wisdom and amazing talent. Many people have become advanced producers and advanced workers. Women have been tempered in labor, mastered technical knowledge, and learned management work. Women account for a large proportion of the leading cadres in street industries and collective welfare undertakings. Since the commune has made proper arrangements for production, work, study, and housework, they have changed from consumers to producers, from lacking cultural technology to gradually mastering cultural technology, and from not being very involved in politics to being concerned about national affairs. After their political and cultural level improved and their family income increased, they further realized equality between men and women, and many truly happy new-type families with harmonious and loving relationships between couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law have emerged.
    5. Urban people's communes have also promoted the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings. Many communes have established spare-time schools with the help of the state and hired full-time teachers. Commune members can study politics, culture, and technology in their spare time. Many communes have started many spare-time literacy classes, primary school classes, and spare-time middle schools by using simple and crude methods and starting from scratch, and have established clubs, libraries, and reading rooms, and often carry out cultural, entertainment, and sports activities to enrich the cultural life of commune members. Some urban people's communes have also established health and hygiene organizations with the assistance of medical and health institutions, and have more organizedly carried out mass movements to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene.
    Urban people's communes can not only promote the high-speed development of production, but also are an important tool for thoroughly transforming old cities to make them suitable for the current stage of socialist construction and the future communist ideal. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that urban people's communes will "become a tool for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities, and become a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution, and people's living welfare." Therefore, the process of establishing, developing, and improving urban people's communes is also the process of accelerating the transformation of old cities and building new socialist cities. In the process of establishing people's communes in our five cities, we have already seen the great role it plays in transforming old cities. Because the establishment of urban people's communes has transformed a large number of consumers into producers, and gradually transformed trivial housework into social labor, it has become a social fashion that labor is glorious, so that these cities have undergone greater changes in production, exchange, distribution, and life, which the original cities could not adapt to. Therefore, the future planning and reconstruction of cities must adapt to these new situations and gradually change these cities from the root to become completely new cities suitable for socialist construction and the future communist ideal.
    The emergence of urban people's communes is the requirement of the broad masses of working people, especially the urgent requirement of the vast number of workers' families. However, due to the differences in ideological awareness, income, living standards, and living habits of various classes in the city, their requirements for establishing urban people's communes are also inconsistent; some capitalists and intellectuals still have some concerns about joining the commune, and at the same time, the change of some people's living habits still requires a long process, and it also requires a considerable process to run more and more perfect collective welfare and service organizations for all the people in the city; therefore, when organizing the production and life of urban people's communes, we should continue to implement the Central Committee's guidelines and policies, actively develop, actively run the communes well, and implement the principle of voluntariness. Therefore, do not require everyone to participate together, but should first absorb those who have genuine requirements and needs to participate. For those who do not have this requirement and need now, and who still have some concerns, do not force them to participate, and persuade them not to force themselves to participate. Especially public canteens, according to the Party's guidelines, we have adopted a policy of both actively running them well and acting according to voluntariness in the countryside, and now we should do the same in cities. As for personal living materials (including houses, clothes, furniture, etc.) and deposits in banks and credit cooperatives, they are still owned by individuals. The houses and other utensils needed for collective welfare undertakings should be promoted in the spirit of starting from scratch, self-reliance, and government assistance, and actively and gradually solved on the basis of developing production. Public canteens and nurseries should also first organize and absorb those who participate in production and are willing to join. Whether or not they participate in the people's commune, daily necessities should be supplied as usual.
    In the mass movement to organize urban people's communes, we must take an active attitude to lead the movement forward. At present, our five cities plan to first run well the people's communes centered on streets, and at the same time gradually run well the people's communes centered on factories, mines, institutions, and schools, and gradually realize the people's communeization of the whole city in batches. Urban people's communes should focus on organizing production, and at the same time organize various collective living welfare undertakings and service undertakings. In organizing production, we must implement the policy of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, self-reliance, and running undertakings diligently and frugally, and in accordance with the characteristics of commune industry, carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, cooperate with large enterprises, and engage in comprehensive utilization to fully exploit production potential, continuously expand production, and incorporate the production of urban people's communes into the unified plan of each city. In organizing various collective living welfare undertakings and service undertakings, we must continue to implement the policy of serving large enterprises, workers, commune members, and residents, and the principle of large collectives and small freedoms, and run well public canteens, nurseries, and living service stations. In the field of culture and education, we must vigorously run various spare-time schools and health and medical undertakings, vigorously carry out cultural and sports activities, strengthen socialist and communist education for commune members, and continuously improve the political, ideological, cultural, scientific, and technological level of commune members.
    In short, the development of the urban people's commune movement is an inevitable trend of historical development and an event of great historical significance. It has unlimited vitality and a bright and great future. At present, the broad masses of people in our five major cities are welcoming the people's commune with joy and excitement. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, urban people's communes will be run well and will be run very well. Urban people's communes will undoubtedly show its brilliant and splendid beauty in the future socialist construction. No matter how maliciously distorted and frantically opposed by imperialist elements and reactionaries, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

    建立城市人民公社具有伟大历史意义
    ——北京、上海、天津、武汉、广州五大城市人民群众欢欣鼓舞迎接人民公社
    万里、曹荻秋、万晓塘、宋一平、朱光代表在人大二次会议上的发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常委的工作报告。
  我们现在对北京、上海、天津、武汉、广州五个城市人民公社的发展情况和今后作法发表几点意见。
    我们五大城市和全国的其他地方一样，在全民整风运动胜利的思想基础上，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的鼓舞下，各项工作都出现了大跃进的局面。由于我们社会主义建设事业的高速度的发展和迫切需要更多的人参加各项生产建设事业，由于广大职工家属、街道居民的思想觉悟大大提高，他们具有迅速摆脱我国一穷二白的落后面貌的愿望和摆脱家务劳动从家庭琐事中解放出来参加社会劳动的强烈要求。基于这些原因，城市街道工业就像雨后春笋般地蓬勃发展起来。城市街道工业大量发展起来以后，参加生产的人们就要求实现生活集体化和家务劳动社会化，并且已经兴办起各种各样的集体生活福利事业和服务事业。为了更好地组织群众的生产、生活、学习，便于和大企业的协作，必须有一种好的相适应的组织形式，因此我们从1958年起就开始试办了城市人民公社。一年多以来的实践，证明人民公社这种组织形式在大城市也是完全适合的，和农村人民公社一样，表现了它的巨大优越性，为广大人民所热烈欢迎，这是因为：
    一、它发展了生产。城市人民公社在组织起来的过程中就兴办了大批的中小工厂，这些工厂是工业战线上一支新生的力量，可以帮助大工厂加工零件、部件和半成品，还可以利用废旧材料生产各种日用工业品，所生产的产品有几百种甚至几千种。因此它在为大工厂服务、为城市人民生活服务、为农业生产服务、和满足市场需要等方面都起了重大作用。仅就我们五大城市街道工业生产的情况来说，在1959年一年的试办期间就创造出近八亿多元的产值和加工费。
    二、它发展了集体生活福利事业，增加了劳动人民的收入，从而改善了人民的生活。一年多来，随着生产的发展，各地人民公社一般地都有了相当数量的积累，公社的积累除了用于扩大再生产以外，还兴办了许多集体生活福利事业，如公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、洗澡堂、敬老院和服务站等。这些集体生活福利事业的兴办大大改善了人民物质生活，深受人民群众的热爱。随着生产的发展，社员的个人收入也有了迅速的增长，1959年的月工资从开始时的十几元，到年底就增长到二、三十元，有的还更多些。
    三、城市人民公社的建立，进一步加强了各部门之间的协作。在公社建立以前，街道生产组织和生活福利组织已经与各部门之间建立了协作关系，但是这种协作还是不系统的、不经常的。公社建立以后，这种协作关系就形成了更有系统的、在更大范围内的经常的大协作。由于协作的加强，就更加促进了生产的发展，改善了职工和居民的生活，更加提高了人们的共产主义觉悟。
    四、城市人民公社的建立，使广大妇女群众特别是家庭妇女走上了彻底解放的道路。公社的从业人员，90％以上都是原来的家庭妇女，家庭妇女的劳动力一旦得到了解放，就发挥出无穷的智慧和惊人的才干，许多人已经成为先进生产者和先进工作者。妇女们在劳动中得到了锻炼，掌握了技术知识，学会了管理工作。在街道工业和集体福利事业的领导干部中妇女占了很大的比重。由于公社把生产、工作、学习、家务作了妥善的安排，这样，她们就由消费者变成生产者，由缺乏文化技术变为逐步掌握文化技术，由不大过问政治变为关心国家大事，她们的政治文化水平提高了和家庭收入增加了以后，就进一步实现了男女平等，出现了很多夫妇、婆媳之间和睦相亲，互敬互爱的真正美满的新型家庭。
    五、城市人民公社还促进了文教卫生事业的发展。许多公社在国家帮助下建立了业余学校，聘请了专职教员，社员可以在劳动之余学习政治、学习文化、学习技术。许多公社因陋就简、白手起家，举办了很多业余扫盲班、小学班、业余中学等学习组织，并且建立了俱乐部、图书室、阅览室等，经常开展文化娱乐体育活动以丰富社员的文化生活。有些城市人民公社还在医疗卫生机关的协助下建立了保健、卫生等组织，更有组织地开展了除四害、讲卫生等群众运动。
    城市人民公社，不仅能促进生产高速度的发展，而且还是彻底改造旧城市使之适合于现阶段的社会主义建设和未来的共产主义理想的重要工具。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出城市人民公社将“成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者。”因此，城市人民公社的建立发展和提高的过程，也就是加速改造旧城市、建设社会主义新城市的过程。在我们五个城市建立人民公社的过程中，我们已经看到它对改造旧城市所起的巨大作用。由于城市人民公社的建立，把大量的消费者变成了生产者，使繁琐的家务劳动，逐步地变成了社会的劳动，劳动光荣已经成为社会风尚，从而使这些城市的面貌发生了更大的变化，在生产、交换、分配、生活等方面，都出现了原来的城市所不能适应的情况，因此今后城市的规划和城市的改建，必须适应这些新的情况加以改变，使这些城市逐步地从根本上改变成为完全适合社会主义建设和未来共产主义理想的崭新的城市。
    城市人民公社的出现是广大劳动人民的要求，特别是广大职工家属的迫切要求，但由于城市中各阶层的思想觉悟、收入、生活水平和生活习惯等有所差别，他们对成立城市人民公社的要求也不一致；有些资本家和知识分子对入社还有些顾虑，同时有些人生活习惯的改变，还需要一个较长的过程，而要把城市全体人民的集体福利和服务组织办得更多更完善也还需要一个相当的过程；因此在组织城市人民公社生产和生活时，应当继续贯彻执行党中央的方针和政策，积极发展、积极把公社办好，又要实行自愿原则，因此，决不要要求一切人都一起参加，而应当首先吸收那些有真正要求和需要的人参加，对那些现在还没有这种要求和需要的人，还有若干顾虑的人不要勉强吸收他们参加，并且劝他们不要勉强参加。特别是公共食堂，根据党的方针，我们在乡村就是采取既积极办好又根据自愿的政策，现在在城市更应该如此。至于对个人所有的生活资料（包括房屋、衣被、家具等）和在银行、信用社的存款，仍然都归个人所有。办理集体福利事业所需要的房屋及其他用具，应提倡因陋就简，自力更生，政府加以辅助的精神，在发展生产的基础上，积极地逐步地加以解决。公共食堂、托儿所亦应首先组织和吸收参加生产而又愿意加入的人参加。无论参加人民公社与否，生活必需品都应照常供应。
    在组织城市人民公社的群众运动中，我们要采取积极的态度领导运动向前发展。目前我们五个城市打算首先办好以街道为中心的人民公社，同时也逐步办好以厂矿、机关、学校为中心的人民公社，逐步分批地实现全市的人民公社化。城市人民公社应该以组织生产为中心，同时组织各种集体生活福利事业和服务事业。在组织生产方面，要贯彻执行因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生、勤俭办事业的方针，并根据公社工业的特点，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，配合大企业、大搞综合利用，充分发挥生产潜力，不断扩大生产，并且把城市人民公社的生产都纳入各城市的统一计划。在组织各种集体生活福利事业和服务事业方面，要继续贯彻执行为大企业、为职工、为社员、为居民服务的方针，和大集体、小自由的原则，办好公共食堂、托儿组织和生活服务站，在文化教育方面大力举办各种业余学校和卫生医疗事业，大力开展文化体育活动，加强对社员的社会主义和共产主义教育，不断提高社员的政治思想觉悟和文化科学技术水平。
    总之，城市人民公社运动的发展，是历史发展的必然趋势，是一个具有伟大历史意义的事件。它有无限的生命力和光明伟大的前途，目前，我们五大城市的广大人民群众正以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接人民公社，我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，城市人民公社一定会办好，而且一定会办得很好。城市人民公社无疑地会在今后社会主义建设事业中，更加展示出它的光辉灿烂的美景。不管帝国主义分子和反动派如何恶意的歪曲和疯狂的反对，他们都必将遭到可耻的失败。
