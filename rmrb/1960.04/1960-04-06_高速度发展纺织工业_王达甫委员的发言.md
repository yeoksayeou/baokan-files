Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I guarantee to implement the spirit, substance, and requirements of each report in my work.

I am an engineering and technical personnel engaged in the textile industry for more than 30 years, and also an intellectual from the old society. I would like to offer some opinions on how to develop China's textile industry at high speed, realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the textile industry in 1960, and accelerate self-transformation. I welcome any corrections from my fellow committee members.

**The Technical Innovation Movement in Shijiazhuang's Textile Industry is Surging Higher and Higher**

Under the inspiration and promotion of the excellent domestic and international situation, and on the basis of continuous leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, the textile industry in various parts of China has maintained a sustained leap forward in the first quarter of 1960, achieving a flying start. Currently, in textile factories across the country, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution is underway, advancing towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, continuous operation, simplified processes, high speed, high efficiency, and diversified varieties. They are advancing towards high-end, precision, cutting-edge, and novel products, taking a majestic and practical form that is both vigorous and down-to-earth, wave after wave, surging forward. Our textile industry in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, like other brother regions, has achieved a flying start and monthly successes in the first quarter of 1960, on the basis of continuous leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of more than 30,000 textile workers under the leadership of the Party. We are continuing to move forward with leaping strides. The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is also advancing wave after wave. I would like to briefly report on the following aspects of our work. First, in terms of saving personnel and increasing labor productivity, our goal for 1960 is to focus on increasing the production efficiency of the six job types with the largest number of workers (four with 1,700 people each, and two with 500 people each) through large-scale production of automatic assembly lines, large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization, large-scale simplification of technological processes, large-scale automation of machine cleaning, large-scale promotion of advanced operating experience, and large-scale innovation and revolution of operating methods. We strive to save more than 5,000 workers in batches each quarter to support the construction of new factories. Currently, in addition to the automatic bobbin placing machine for the spinning frame being promoted in various textile factories, the automatic doffing machine is also ready for full-scale promotion. The automatic heald frame drawing-in machine has also been successfully created by the research group of Song Changrang (eighth-grade worker) from Shijiazhuang State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, 2, and 3. It ingeniously and automatically connects the six single actions of manual labor that drawing-in workers have been performing for many years. This alone will save more than 500 drawing-in workers after it is fully promoted in our city before May Day. If it is rapidly promoted nationwide, it can save about 10,000 drawing-in workers. Because we vigorously promoted the advanced experience of Qiu Suogui, a national advanced weaving worker, and Yang Liying, a fine yarn spinner, and vigorously promoted the automation of fine yarn cleaning, the tending capacity of weaving workers and fine yarn spinners in our city has generally increased by 20% to 100%. In addition to the above five types of work, we are also actively organizing research to solve the problem of manual shuttle loading.

Second, we have vigorously promoted high speed and high efficiency. In the yarn mills, the speed and output of medium and high count yarn in some factories have reached the national advanced level. In the cloth mill of Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, the large-scale high-yield production of 260 rpm high-speed looms continues to lead the country.

Third, according to this year's cotton resource supply situation, we have actively implemented the policy of the Ministry of Textile Industry to develop towards high-end, precision, cutting-edge, and novel products. Under the instructions and strong support of the provincial and municipal Party committees, we are vigorously developing finer yarn counts and innovative product varieties while ensuring product quality. Currently, the cotton yarn count has increased from an average of 22.92 counts in February to more than 25 counts, and the average count will be rapidly increased to more than 30 counts in April. This can save more than 44,330 dan of cotton per month for spinning. The yarn saved each month for weaving can produce about 3 million meters of cloth.

Fourth, we have vigorously seized the full utilization of all spinnable fibers and are vigorously developing the production of blended fiber fabrics. We are prepared to complete the glorious task of producing 15 million meters of blended fiber fabrics assigned to our city by the province in the second and third quarters of this year, and strive to weave more than 3 million meters in April to celebrate May Day. Currently, the degumming work of cotton stalk bark fiber has been successfully tested and put into production using a combination of chemical and physical local methods without the need for caustic soda (first treated with quicklime, and then subjected to rubbing and rolling treatment on specially designed machinery, with good degumming effect).

Fifth, we have vigorously developed a variety of colors and patterns. The variety of colors and patterns in various textile factories in our city has increased about tenfold compared to 1959. Compared with advanced brother regions, the above achievements are still very backward in some aspects, especially far from the requirements of the Party and the people for the textile industry. But we have great ambitions and determination to continue to humbly learn from brother regions, muster greater efforts, strive for the upstream, strive for the first, and make greater contributions to the Party and the people.

**Several Suggestions for High-Speed Development of the Textile Industry**

Below, I would like to put forward the following suggestions for the government's reference on how to develop China's textile industry at high speed.

1.  The Ministry of Textile Industry should systematically and vigorously grasp the technical transformation of existing textile factory equipment. Adopting the "five simultaneous" approach, vigorously promote the technical revolution achievements that have been initially achieved in the high-speed, high-efficiency, continuous, and simplified pre-spinning preparation machinery, and in the use of ultra-large drafting in the spinning frame (a new simple and practical method for the winding problem of direct spinning with cotton sliver has been researched in Shijiazhuang Textile Factory). In this way, without increasing the building area of the factory, adding spindles can increase the production capacity of the original textile factory by more than 50%. Coupled with the continuous improvement of the mechanical operating speed level, it is also very possible to double the cotton yarn output on the existing level. It is recommended that the central government put forward requirements for the progress of the transformation of old factories in major textile bases, and give them necessary support. After the pre-spinning preparation machinery achieves high speed, high efficiency, and simplified processes, a certain number of equipment can be extracted to support new factories. This can not only save a lot of infrastructure investment, but also reduce some of the burden on textile machinery factories for manufacturing new machines, and at the same time save a lot of steel needed to manufacture new machines, which is truly a triple win.

2.  Vigorously, extensively, and comprehensively open up sources of textile raw materials. In addition to instructing the agricultural departments to continue to correctly implement the effective eight-character constitution for agriculture in accordance with local conditions, so as to strive to improve the yield per mu of cotton and hemp, it is also necessary to mobilize all communes, especially those in plateau areas and those with abundant water and grassland, to vigorously and widely develop the mass movement of improving sheep breeds, breeding sheep, greatly increasing the production of fine wool, planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms, and increasing the production of natural silk, in accordance with local geographical conditions, in order to open up wool and silk fiber resources for domestic textile use. It should also instruct the provinces to make comprehensive use of resources in a local and foreign combined manner, and vigorously develop the production of man-made fibers and synthetic fibers from local to foreign, in order to enrich the sources of textile raw materials. At the same time, it is hoped that the communes can be further mobilized to vigorously collect and process wild plant fibers. Only in this way, developing textile raw material resources from multiple sources in a large and comprehensive manner can gradually reverse the basic situation that the increase in cotton production still cannot meet the development needs of the textile industry.

3.  It is recommended that the Ministry of Textile Industry instruct textile machinery factories across the country to increase the production quantity of cotton spinning combing machines and twisting machines, and allocate them to various places for use in a planned manner, so as to increase the national average count of cotton yarn to more than 30 counts in the short term, so that textile products can rapidly develop towards high-end and precision. In this way, because some yarn counts have passed through the combing machine, the proportion of ply yarn fabrics increases, the product quality can be greatly improved, and the variety of colors and patterns can be greatly increased. More importantly, the same amount of raw materials can be used to spin more yarn and weave more cloth.

4.  Vigorously grasp the organizational construction of textile science and technology research institutions. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the continuous and in-depth development of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, a series of topics have emerged from the perspective of solving the key to current production, and from the direction of improving the design of textile machinery and the adoption of new processes and new technologies. It is necessary to implement the research policy of walking on two legs with mass research and key research by professional institutions, and combining higher education institutions, production enterprises, and scientific research institutions for research and resolution. It is recommended that the science and technology commissions at all levels should guide and assist in supplementing, strengthening, and adding textile science and technology research institutions at all levels, so as to meet the needs of the leap-forward development of the textile industry production. At present, our emerging bases mostly have not yet established textile research institutions.

5.  It is recommended that relevant departments at all levels vigorously grasp the expansion and training of the textile engineering and technical personnel team, and prepare sufficient cadres and technical workers for the large-scale construction of new factories.

Finally, because I am an intellectual from the old society, and under the cordial care and cultivation and education of the Party in the past ten years since liberation, although the level of political and ideological consciousness has been improved to a certain extent, I feel that it is still far from meeting the needs of the current situation of rapid development of production. The issues of class stand and world outlook still need to be resolved more thoroughly through long-term efforts in the future. Therefore, I will resolutely devote myself to the political theory study movement of studying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts and works, truly achieve political command, and gradually learn to master and apply the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages in my work. I will muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, better give play to my subjective initiative, so as to do my job more predictably, practically, and meticulously, and overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned to me by the Party and the government. Comrades! Let us hold high the banner of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and, under the brilliant illumination of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People’s Commune, courageously advance to accelerate self-transformation and realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward in the national economy in 1960!

Finally, I wish all committee members good health!

专栏：

    高速度发展纺织工业
    王达甫委员的发言主席，各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，并保证把各个报告的精神、实质和要求贯彻到自己的工作中去。
    我是一个从事纺织工业三十多年的工程技术人员，同时也是一个旧知识分子，我愿意就如何高速度发展我国纺织工业，实现纺织工业在1960年更大更好更全面的跃进，和加速自我改造问题谈一些意见，不妥之处请各位委员指正。
    石家庄纺织工业技术革新运动一浪高过一浪
    我国各地的纺织工业在国内外大好形势的鼓舞和推动下，在1958年和1959年连续取得了大跃进的基础上，在1960年第一季度又保持了持续跃进的速度，取得开门红。当前各地的纺织厂，以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，连续化、简程化，高速、高效化，品种多样化，向高、精、尖、新进军的技术革新、技术革命运动的高潮，正在以万紫千红排山倒海地既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的形势，一浪高一浪的滚滚向前发展。我们河北省石家庄市的纺织工业，与其他兄弟地区一样，由于三万多名纺织工人在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，也在取得了1958年和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，在1960年第一季度又取得了开门红、月月红，正以跃进的步伐继续向前迈进。技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，也在一个高潮跟着一个高潮地向前发展着。我仅就以下几个方面的工作做一简单汇报。首先，在节约定员提高劳动生产率方面，我们1960年的目标是通过大搞生产自动流水作业线，大搞机械化、半机械化，大搞简化工艺过程，大搞机械清洁的自动化，大推先进操作经验，大搞操作法的革新和革命以提高人数最多的六个工种的生产效率（四个一千七百人，两个五百人）为主攻方向，力争逐季分批地节约出劳动力五千人以上，来支援新厂建设。目前除细纱自动摆管机正在各纺织厂推广外，自动落纱机也已做好了全面推广的准备。自动穿筘机也已由石家庄国棉一、二、三厂的宋常让（八级工）研究小组创造成功，把穿筘工人多年来纯粹以手工劳动的六个单项动作，精巧地自动地连贯了起来。仅这一项，在五一节前，在我市全面推广后即可节省穿筘工人五百名以上。如迅速在全国范围内推广，则可节省穿筘工人一万名左右。由于我们大力推广了我市全国先进生产者织布挡车工仇锁贵和细纱挡车工杨琍瑛的先进经验，大搞了细纱清洁自动化，我市各厂织布工人和细纱工人的看台能力普遍的扩大了20％到100％。除以上五个工种外，对解决手工装梭问题，也正积极组织研究中。
    第二，是我们大搞了高速、高效化，在纱场中支和高支纱的速度和单产部分厂，已达到全国先进水平。在布场石纺厂的260转／分高速布机的大面积丰产继续在全国领先。
    第三，是我们根据今年棉花资源供应情况，积极贯彻了纺织工业部向高、精、尖、新发展的方针，在省、市委的指示和大力支持下，正在保证产品质量的前提下，大搞纱支改细和大创新品种的工作。目前，棉纱支数已由本年2月份全市平均二十二点九二支提高到二十五支以上，4月份内平均支数将再迅速提高到三十支以上的水平。这样每月可节省出棉花四万四千三百三十担来多纺纱。每月节约出来的织布用纱可多织布三百万米左右。
    第四，是我们大抓了充分利用一切可纺纤维，正在大搞杂纤维布的生产工作。准备在本年二、三季度内完成省分配给我市的一千五百万米的杂纤维布的光荣任务，力争在4月份内先织出三百万米以上，向五一节献礼。目前利用棉秆皮纤维的脱胶工作已在不用火碱的前提下，用化学和物理结合处理的土办法试验成功投入生产（先以生石灰处理，然后在设计的专用机械上进行搓轧处理，脱胶效果良好）。
    第五，是我们大搞了花色品种。我市各纺织厂的花色品种，目前较1959年增加了十倍左右。以上成绩与先进兄弟地区比较，在若干方面还是很落后的，特别是距离党和人民对纺织工业的要求还很远。但我们有雄心大志，决心继续虚心向兄弟地区学习，鼓足更大的干劲、力争上游、力争第一，为党和人民做出更大贡献。
    对高速度发展纺织工业的几点建议
    下面我对如何高速度发展我国纺织工业的问题提出以下几点建议，供政府参考。
    一、纺织工业部应有计划地大力地抓好现有纺织厂设备的技术改造工作。采取“五边”办法，大力推广在前纺准备机械的高速高效化、连续化、简程化方面，与在细纱机采用超大牵伸方面（用棉条直纺的卷绕问题，在石纺已研究出新的简易适用办法）已初步取得的技术革命成果。这样在不增加厂房建筑面积的条件下，增装纱锭，即可使原有纺织厂生产能力增加50％以上。再加上机械运转速度水平的不断提高，棉纱产量在既有水平上翻上一番也是大有可能的。建议中央在老厂改造的进度方面，对各主要纺织基地都提出要求，并给以必要的支持。前纺准备机械在实现高速高效化和简程化工艺以后，可抽出一定数量的设备支援新建厂。这样既可节约大量的基建投资，又可以减轻对纺织机械厂对新机制造的若干负担，同时又能节约大量的制造新机器所需要的钢材，实属一举三得。
    二、大力地广泛全面地开辟纺织原料的来源。除应责成农业部门继续正确的因地制宜地贯彻行之有效的农业八字宪法，以努力提高棉花和麻类的亩产量以外，还应发动各公社，特别是高原地区和富有水草旷地的公社，根据当地地理条件，有计划有目标地大力广泛地开展改良羊种，繁殖羊只，大量增产细羊毛和植桑养蚕，增产天然丝的群众运动，以开辟供国内纺织用的羊毛和蚕丝的纤维资源。也应责成各省根据资源条件，以土洋结合的方法大搞资源的综合利用，由土到洋地，大搞人造纤维与合成纤维的生产，以充实纺织原料来源。同时希望能进一步发动公社，大搞野生植物纤维的采集和加工。只有这样，从多方面、大力全面地开发纺织原料资源才能逐步扭转棉花增产还不能满足纺织工业发展需要的基本情况。
    三、建议纺织工业部责成全国各纺织机械厂增加棉纺精梳机和拈线机的生产数量，有计划地分配到各地使用，把全国的棉纱平均支数在短期内提高到三十支以上，使纺织品迅速向高、精发展。这样由于若干纱支经过了精梳机，合股线织物的比重增加，产品质量既可大大地提高，花色品种又可大大地增加，更重要的是以同样数量的原料，可以大大地多纺纱多织布。
    四、大搞纺织科学技术研究机构的组织建设工作。大跃进以来，纺织工业随着增产节约群众运动的持续地深入地开展，从解决当前生产中的关键看，从改进纺织机械的设计与新工艺、新技术的采用的方向来看，都出现了一系列课题。必须贯彻群众性研究与专业机构重点研究的两条腿走路和高等院校、生产企业、科研机构三结合的研究方针加以研究解决。建议各级科委应指导和协助把各级纺织科学技术研究机构，充实加强和增设起来，以适应纺织工业生产飞跃发展的需要。目前我们新兴的基地，纺织科研机构尚多未建立起来。
    五、是建议各级有关部门，大抓纺织工程技术人员队伍的扩大与培训工作，为大规模增建新厂准备足够的干部和技术工人。
    最后因为我是一个旧知识分子，解放十年来，在党的亲切关怀和培养教育下，政治思想觉悟水平虽然有了一定程度的提高，但自己感觉到还远不能适应当前生产飞跃发展形势的需要，阶级立场问题和世界观问题都还有待于今后通过长期的努力来求得比较彻底的解决。因此，我要坚决地投入学习毛泽东主席的思想和著作的政治理论学习运动，真正做到政治挂了帅，逐步学会在工作中能掌握和运用毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的精神和实质，鼓足更大的革命干劲，更好地发挥自己的主观能动作用，以达到更有预见性地踏实细致地做好自己的岗位工作，超额完成党和政府交给自己的光荣任务。同志们！让我们高举起无往不胜的毛泽东思想的旗帜在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，为加速自我改造，为实现1960年国民经济更好更全面的跃进而奋勇前进！
    最后祝各位委员同志们身体健康！
