    Eagles Break the Ice Dam
    On March 18th, on the Yellow River not far from Baotou, a seven-mile-long ice dam suddenly formed. The ice dam cut off the water flow, and the river water rose rapidly, breaking through the riverbank. The overflowing river water seriously threatened the lives and property of the people on both sides. The mayor of Baotou City fought alongside the masses on the dike, plugging two breaches. However, the ice continued to accumulate, and the water level continued to rise sharply. Some sections were already more than a foot deep over the earthen embankment, and the situation was very critical. Now, the best way is to bomb the ice dam with airplanes.
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force accepted the mission of "flying to Baotou to bomb the Yellow River ice dam." The weather was very bad that day, with visibility of only a few hundred meters. According to the weather report: there would be rain and snow after ten o'clock. The commander decisively made the decision: eliminate this "enemy" before ten o'clock!
    A green signal flare soared into the sky, and the plane took off on command, breaking through the dark, low clouds and heading straight for the sky above the ice dam area.
    A few minutes later, Squadron Leader Wang Xude reported to the command post: "The weather above the target is deteriorating, the cloud ceiling is six hundred meters, request to lower the bombing altitude and drop bombs continuously!" The commander understood that bombing at such an altitude was very dangerous, and the strong shock waves of the bombs could threaten the safety of the aircraft. However, the lives and property of the people must be the first priority! He decisively issued the order. A minute later, bombs exploded one after another.
    All the bombs hit the target. The ice dam was breached, and the water level was dropping...
    However, the battle was not over. On March 20th, two more large ice dams formed near Limenyingzi and Nanhaizi. The rolling river water washed away the flood control dikes. The embankment in Chouren Gedan Village had only two inches left, and the five or six neighboring villages were also in the same critical situation. The Party and government leaders of the Yimeng Banner on the south bank of the river and all the villagers who could be mobilized were guarding the dikes day and night. Along the river for dozens of miles, people were on the dikes.
    At this critical moment, the Air Force soldiers once again received the task of bombing the ice dam. The planes flew into the air above the ice dam against the wind and sand, bombing in turn. Explosions roared, and thick smoke mixed with ice blocks stirred up huge columns of water.
    The ice dams were all blown open. The turbulent Yellow River flowed obediently to the East China Sea according to the will of the people. People along the coast celebrated the victory over the spring flood this year and joyfully plunged into spring planting.

    雄鹰破冰坝
    3月18日，距包头市不远的黄河上，突然结成一道七里长的大冰坝，冰坝截断了水流，河水飞快地上涨，冲破河堤。泛滥的河水，严重地威胁着两岸人民生命财产的安全。包头市市长和群众一道上堤奋战，堵住了两处缺口。但冰凌继续增加，水势还在猛涨，有的地段已淹没土堰一尺多深，情况非常危急。现在，最好的办法就是用飞机炸开冰坝。
    中国人民解放军空军某部，接受了“飞往包头，炸开黄河冰坝”的任务。这天天气很坏，能见度只有几百米，根据气象报告：十点钟后有雨雪。指挥员果断地下了决心：十点钟以前把这个“敌人”干掉！
    一颗绿色信号弹飞上天空，飞机奉命起飞，穿破黑压压的低云，直奔冰坝地区上空。
    几分钟之后，大队长王绪德向指挥所报告：“目标上空天气变坏，云高六百米，请求降低轰炸高度，连续投弹！”指挥员心里明白，在这样高度投弹是十分危险的，炸弹强烈的冲击波可能威胁到飞机的安全。但是，首先要对人民的生命财产负责啊！他果断地下了命令。一分钟后，接二连三的炸弹爆炸了。
    炸弹全部命中目标。冰坝炸开了，水势在下降……。
    但是，战斗并没有结束。3月20日，在立门营子、南海子附近，又结了两道大冰坝。滚滚的河水，冲垮了防洪堤。丑人疙旦村的围堰还剩下两寸了，邻近五、六个村庄也处在同样危急的情况下。河南岸伊盟旗委的党政领导干部和村里所有能出动的群众日日夜夜守在堤上，沿河几十里，人们都上堤了。
    在这紧急的时刻，空军战士又一次接到了轰炸冰坝的任务。飞机迎着风沙飞到冰坝上空，轮番轰炸。爆炸声滚滚传来，浓烟夹着冰块卷起了巨大的水柱。
    冰坝都被炸开了。汹涌的黄水，按照人们的意志乖乖地流向东海。沿岸人们庆祝今年战胜凌汛的胜利，欢乐地投入春播。
