Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou dispatch: Guangdong's rural "Six Good" canteen movement has been widely launched throughout the province, effectively promoting spring plowing production. The requirements for "Six Good" canteens are: good grain management, good production and housework arrangements, good living arrangements, good democratic management, good cooking utensil reforms, and good leadership style.

Currently, there are more than 200,000 public canteens in rural Guangdong, and over 90% of commune members eat in canteens. The "Six Good" public canteens that have reached higher standards in various places have implemented a system of centralized management, special grain for special storage, special personnel for special management, and special grain for special use in terms of grain management. They have also conscientiously implemented the grain ration distribution system of fixed quotas per person, targets assigned to households, grain delivered to the canteen, eating based on tickets, and savings returned to individuals, so that most commune members have grain savings. These canteens have also established their own vegetable, pig breeding, poultry, and processed non-staple food production bases, achieving basic self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods, and surplus in some products. These canteens can all achieve rational use of grain, mixed staple and coarse grains, refined processing of coarse grains, diverse meals, and delicious food. These canteens have established canteen management committees, holding meetings every five or ten days to discuss and arrange canteen production and life; and holding general meetings of all commune members every half month or month to widely listen to mass opinions. The canteen's production and living accounts are also published monthly so that the masses are clear about the canteen's affairs and can supervise at any time. These canteens have also made great progress in cooking utensil reforms, increasing labor efficiency by one to several times, greatly reducing the labor force used in canteens.

Through the "Six Good" canteen movement, all localities have not only arranged the lives of commune members better, but also greatly improved the production enthusiasm of commune members, effectively promoting production. In all communes, brigades, and production teams that have achieved "Six Good" canteens, the attendance rate and labor efficiency of the masses have significantly improved. After the Zhongxia Brigade canteen of the Meigang Commune in Jieyang County launched the "Six Good" movement, the labor efficiency of the entire team exceeded the original target, making spring plowing production complete well and quickly. The Tanfu Brigade of the Lengkeng Commune in Huaiji County, through the "Six Good" canteen movement, established nurseries, kindergartens, and various living service stations centered on the canteen, greatly reducing the housework labor of female commune members, and turning many women who had previously had low attendance into production activists. Many "Six Good" public canteens have become the central places for commune members' political, economic, cultural, and recreational activities, and the commune members' collectivist spirit and concept of loving the commune and the canteen are becoming increasingly strong.

Beijing News: 81.9% of the agricultural population in Shanxi Province has joined public canteens. The 88,100-plus people's commune canteens throughout the province are getting better and better.

Based on the principle of grasping production with one hand and life with the other, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has continuously instructed local, municipal, and county committees to strengthen leadership over canteens. Since this spring, the Jinbei area has organized 6,000 cadres to go to the countryside to help various communes rectify their canteens. The number of first-class canteens in the entire area has increased from 32% to 61%, second-class canteens account for 32%, and third-class canteens have decreased from 20% to about 7%. After rectification in the Jinzhong area, among the 74,400-plus canteen staff members, Party members and Youth League members accounted for 15,700, and poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 74.2%, consolidating the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants. After rectification, the canteens are consolidated, and commune members love the canteens even more.

Over the past year, many commune members and cadres in rural Shanxi have put in a lot of effort to further consolidate and improve canteens and give play to their role in rural production and life, and have explored many experiences in running canteens well. For example, according to statistics from 1,460 canteens in Xinding, Wutai, and Zuoyun counties in the Jinbei area, commune members have put forward more than 24,000 constructive opinions to the canteens.

Based on the experience of advanced canteens, most canteens in various places throughout the province have paid attention to growing vegetables and raising pigs, and vigorously developing non-staple food production. Among the 25,000 canteens in the Jinnan Special Zone, 11,700 have established vegetable bases, 19,500 have established pig farms, and 5,900 have established small tofu workshops, flour mills, and sauce and vinegar workshops. The good canteens in the Jindongnan area have "one garden" (vegetable garden), "five workshops" (flour, oil, sauce, vinegar, tofu), and "eight breeding" (breeding pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, fish, dairy cows). Various localities have summarized the benefits of canteens developing non-staple food production as: 1. Not competing with commodity bases for products can ensure the completion and over-completion of national procurement plans, and at the same time can provide commune members with a certain supply of non-staple foods, improving the lives of commune members; 2. Selling the surplus to the state not only supports the needs of the state, but also increases the income of commune members; 3. With the increase in income from canteen sideline production, the canteen's capital accumulation can be increased to expand the canteen or add to the canteen's equipment; at the same time, it can gradually realize eating salt, vinegar, vegetables, etc. without spending money, increase supplies, and develop communist factors; 4. Saving grain; 5. Comprehensive utilization, giving play to the potential of materials, using the residue from workshops to feed livestock and poultry, and using the fertilizer from livestock and poultry to fertilize the fields and increase production. While vigorously developing non-staple food production, various localities have paid special attention to cooking utensil reforms, shortening cooking time, and greatly adapting to the needs of the development of collective life; at the same time, it has further saved social labor.

Commune canteens not only benefit production and improve the lives of commune members, but also create convenient conditions for the cultural and recreational activities of commune members. The Party organizations of communes, management areas, and production teams cleverly combine the recreation room, classroom, and dining hall in the canteen. The broad masses of commune members say that the current canteens provide both material and spiritual food. They say that listening to the radio and reading newspapers in the canteen is: "Walking into the canteen door, hearing about world affairs, understanding clearly and brightening the eyes, increasing enthusiasm many times over."

    广东大办六好食堂社员干劲越来越高  山西重视总结管理经验食堂越办越好
    据新华社广州电　广东农村的“六好”食堂运动，已经在全省普遍展开，有力地推动了春耕生产。“六好”食堂的要求是：粮食管得好、生产家务好、安排生活好、民主管理好、炊具改革好和领导作风好。
    目前，广东农村公共食堂已发展到二十多万个，90％以上的公社社员在食堂吃饭。各地已达到较高标准的“六好”公共食堂，在粮食管理方面，实行了集中管理、专粮专仓、专人专管、专粮专用的制度，并认真执行了按人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节余归己的口粮分配制度，使大部分社员都有粮食节余。这些食堂还都建立了自己的蔬菜、养猪、家禽和加工副食品等生产基地，做到了主要副食品基本自给，部分产品做到自给有余。这些食堂都能做到合理用粮、主杂粮混合、粗粮细吃、饭菜多样和美味可口。这些食堂都建立了食堂管理委员会，每五天或十天开一次会议，讨论安排食堂的生产、生活；半个月或一个月召开一次全体社员会议，广泛听取群众意见，食堂的生产和生活账目，也都按月公布，使群众都清楚食堂的家务，随时进行监督。这些食堂的炊具改革也都取得很大成绩，劳动效率提高了一倍到几倍，大大减少了用于食堂的劳动力。
    各地通过开展“六好”食堂运动，不仅对社员生活安排得更好，而且大大提高了社员的生产积极性，有力地推动了生产。所有实现了“六好”食堂的公社、大队、生产队，群众的出勤率和劳动效率都显著提高。揭阳县梅岗公社中厦大队各食堂开展“六好”运动以后，全队劳动效率都突破了原来规定指标，使春耕生产完成得又好又快。怀集县冷坑公社谭福大队，通过开展“六好”食堂运动，以食堂为中心办好了托儿所、幼儿园和各项生活服务站，大大减少女社员的家务劳动，使许多过去出勤较少的妇女，也变成了生产积极分子。许多“六好”公共食堂成了社员政治、经济、文化娱乐活动的中心场所，社员的集体主义精神和爱社爱食堂的观念越来越浓厚。
    本报讯　山西省81.9％的农业人口参加了公共食堂。全省八万八千一百多个人民公社的食堂，越办越好。
    根据一手抓生产，一手抓生活的原则，中共山西省委不断指示各地、市、县委加强对食堂的领导工作。晋北区自今春以来，组织了六千名干部下乡，帮助各公社对食堂普遍进行了整顿，全区第一类食堂由原来的32％上升为61％，第二类食堂占32％，第三类食堂由原来的20％下降为7％左右。晋中区各食堂经过整顿，七万四千多个食堂工作人员中，党员、团员占一万五千七百人，贫农、下中农占74.2％，巩固地树立了贫农、下中农领导优势。经过整顿食堂巩固了，社员更加喜爱食堂。
    一年多来，山西农村的许多社员和社干部，为了进一步巩固和提高食堂，发挥食堂在农村生产、生活中的作用，曾经费了许多心血，摸索出许多办好食堂的经验。如晋北区忻定、五台、左云等县，据一千四百六十个食堂统计，社员们就给食堂提了二万四千余条建设性意见。
    根据先进食堂的经验，全省各地的大部分食堂，都注意了种菜养猪，大搞副食品生产。晋南专区二万五千个食堂中，有一万一千七百个食堂建立了蔬菜基地，一万九千五百个食堂建立了猪场，有五千九百个建立了小型豆腐坊、粉坊和酱醋作坊。晋东南区好的食堂有一园（菜园）、五坊（粉、油、酱、醋、豆腐）、八养（养猪、羊、鸡、鸭鹅、兔、鱼、奶牛）。各地总结食堂发展副食品生产的好处是：一、不与商品基地争产品，可以保证国家收购计划的完成和超额完成，同时可以使社员得到一定的副食品供应，提高社员生活；二、有多余的卖给国家，既支援了国家需要，又增加了社员收入；三、在食堂副业生产收入增多的情况下，可以增加食堂的资金积累，以便扩建食堂或增添食堂的设备；同时也可以逐步实现吃盐、吃醋、吃菜等不花钱，增加供应部分，发展共产主义因素；四、节约粮食；五、综合利用，发挥物资潜力，作坊的渣子等饲养家畜家禽，家畜家禽的肥料又可以肥田，增加生产。在大搞副食生产的同时，各地特别注意了炊具改革，做饭时间缩短，大大地适应了集体生活发展的需要；同时更进一步地节省了社会劳动力。
    公社食堂不仅有利生产，提高社员的生活，而且给社员的文化娱乐活动创造了方便条件。公社、管理区、生产队党的组织，巧妙地把文娱室、课室和食堂中的饭厅捏合在一起。广大社员说，现在的食堂，既有物质食粮，又有精神食粮。他们称在食堂内听广播、看书报是：“走进食堂门，天下大事闻，心明眼又亮，干劲成倍增。”
