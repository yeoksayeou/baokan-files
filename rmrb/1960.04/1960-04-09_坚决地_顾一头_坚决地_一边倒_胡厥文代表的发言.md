Comrades Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow members:

I listened to and studied Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft" with great excitement. These two reports have further enhanced my understanding of our country's prosperous economy, abundant financial resources, stable prices, and increased inventory, as well as the leap-forward development of our national economy at a great-leap-forward speed. Our country's future is truly as beautiful as a flower and shines brightly. As a citizen of New China, I feel incredibly happy and proud. I fully agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

I am an industrialist and businessman, having been engaged in the machine industry for decades. Therefore, I am particularly interested in the parts of the reports concerning technical innovation and technical revolution. Through two years of continuous great leap forward, our country's socialist construction has begun a new stage, that is, the sustained leap forward of the national economy at a higher speed than during the First Five-Year Plan. In this great leap forward, our country has not only unprecedentedly increased the output of industry and agriculture, meeting the needs of national construction and the people's lives, but also, due to the rapid advancement of large-scale production and construction, our country has transformed from a country with surplus labor to a country with a labor shortage. For the sustained leap forward of the national economy, we must, under the leadership of the Party, mobilize the whole nation to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution in order to liberate labor and improve labor productivity. This is the main content of the current increase production and practice economy movement.

Technical innovation is emerging in an endless stream, and its potential is unlimited. It seems like a myth, but it is indeed a living reality.

I came to Beijing last December to attend the representative conferences of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and returned to Shanghai this February. It is just like the old Chinese saying: "A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." I only left Shanghai for three months, and the entire Shanghai has already set off a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution. Shanghai's appearance on all fronts has changed, and it has changed greatly. Taking the industrial sector as an example, Shanghai's more than one million workers are, on the one hand, striving to change manual operation and heavy physical labor, for mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, getting rid of backward manual operation and heavy physical labor, and striving for the "second liberation" after political and economic emancipation; on the other hand, they are also advancing at high speed towards high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products, and everyone is determined to build Shanghai into one of the national industrial bases for high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products, and one of the national centers for scientific and technological research. "The plan for a year lies in spring." In the first spring of the 1960s, Shanghai's more than one million workers fought a beautiful battle on the production front: the city successfully trial-produced more than 15,000 new products and new designs, including more than 5,500 new products and more than 700 high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products.

This time, during the inspection of the Shanghai People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members, although I saw very little due to time constraints, only a few factories, everywhere I went, the workers were
  "Facing difficulties and stepping forward," consciously throwing themselves into the magnificent technical revolution movement. They were all fascinated by technical innovation, working day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, chasing each other, and advancing together. They used all their brains to break through the "technical barrier," one invention followed another, and everyone competed to plant the red flag on the peak of technology. I saw a fountain pen factory where parts such as nibs, caps, clips, and pen tongues were originally made in several processes each. Now, many new machines have been successfully trial-produced, connecting three or four, five or six processes together. Many people have visualized this operation. They said that connecting processes from one to another forms "a small dragon." With the progress of technology, they will also connect the "small dragons" to become a "big dragon." This increases speed, reduces labor, and also improves quality. In terms of improving production equipment, some factories have just put newly improved equipment into trial use, while newer and better equipment is being designed and manufactured. Such continuous development, continuous innovation, and continuous improvement were unimaginable in the past.

I also saw a tape recorder factory where the tape recorders were originally inspected manually after they were made, and only people with high skills could do the job. At most, only forty units could be inspected a day. Now, it has been changed to automatic inspection, without the need for an inspector, and 800 units can be inspected every day. Automatic inspection is carried out continuously in four stages. Every tape recorder, after passing through these four stages of inspection, will automatically go to the finished product room if it fully meets the specifications. If any stage fails the inspection, it will automatically make a record, and the subsequent inspection stages will no longer inspect it, and it will automatically go to the repair room. The repair personnel can then carry out repairs according to the record. Such scientific inspection is far more accurate and reliable than manual inspection. This factory also uses tape recorders to automatically control the production process of machine parts. They first record the action, speed, size, and dimensions of manufacturing the first one on the tape recorder, and then use the tape recorder to control subsequent production, automatically manufacturing them one by one, with uniform specifications and exceptional accuracy. These examples are enough to prove that in the current great leap forward, technical innovation is emerging in an endless stream, and its potential is unlimited. It seems like a myth, but it is indeed a living reality.

The vigorous atmosphere of the people's communes running industries has greatly moved me.

What impressed me particularly and moved me greatly was the vigorous atmosphere of the people's communes running industries. I personally saw a machine factory run by a commune, where there was not a single pattern maker, not a single machine technician, not a single foundry technician, not a single repair technician. In short, there was not a single master; there was only a group of rural young men and women. In the eyes of those who believe in foreign experts and foreign equipment, this machine factory could not achieve anything. However, this group of young men and women, who were still farmers working in the fields last year, had no experience in using machines, let alone manufacturing machines, and now they have all become experts on the industrial front. The car repair department of this factory not only has minor repair skills, but also can overhaul damaged cylinders; it can not only repair tractors by itself, but also can assist transportation companies in repairing trucks. It has also made a large-scale electric incubator that can simultaneously hatch 16,000 chicks at a time. In this factory, there is also a women's technical team, relying on their "pioneering spirit," which successfully trial-produced water pumps, motors, and welding machines that fully meet the specifications, as a gift to the "March 8th" Women's Day, and received the honorary title of the Red Flag Team.

This group of young men and women are as eager for technical research as they are for food. In their own words, if they are not allowed to work, it is like not giving them food to eat. In their eyes, labor, especially labor for socialism, is entertainment, it is the most pleasant thing.

As far as I have seen and heard, the industrial output value of several people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai has already approached its agricultural output value. This is still a new sprout, it has strong vitality, and it is not difficult to double its output several times. Its future is limitless. If the industrial output value of each of the more than 26,000 people's communes across the country can greatly exceed its agricultural output value, how much wealth will this create for the country, and what a huge role it will play in accelerating China's industrialization, it is really difficult to estimate.

With the people's communes running industries, agricultural tools can be self-made, self-repaired, and self-used, which will definitely promote agricultural mechanization both practically and rapidly. After agricultural mechanization, one person can be equivalent to twenty or thirty people, which can liberate unlimited labor to support the commune-run industry and the country's industrial construction.

With the people's communes running industries, most farmers can also have the opportunity to learn industrial technical knowledge, and cultivate reserve technical forces for national industrialization.

Today, when we look around, from cities to villages, and from villages to cities, everywhere is a scene of red flags waving, a new atmosphere of everyone innovating, everything innovating, and every industry innovating. This is the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution under the correct leadership of the Party. This is the great victory of the Party's general line for building socialism! This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Faced with the massive technical innovation and technical revolution movement, how should industrialists and businessmen catch up is an urgent issue.

Faced with such an unprecedentedly magnificent, immensely powerful, extremely rich in content, and particularly effective technical innovation and technical revolution movement, how should we industrialists and businessmen catch up and make contributions is indeed an urgent issue.

Many of us industrialists and businessmen have certain production technology and business experience, which used to be used to serve capitalism and individual interests; today, if they are used to serve socialism and collective interests, these technologies and experiences can play a role. The key lies in the transformation of political stand and world outlook. Chairman Mao instructed us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is as if there is no soul." It is precisely politics that guides technology, and technology that embodies politics. If we do not strengthen the transformation of our political stand and world outlook while engaging in the technical revolution movement, our production technology and business experience cannot play a role at all, or even play a counter-role. Therefore, we must strengthen learning.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "The technical innovation and technical revolution movement should be combined with the movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works, which is being widely carried out throughout the country, so that the movement has the guidance of correct thought." I fully accept and support this instruction from Vice Premier Li Fuchun. Today, most of us in the industrial and commercial circles still have duality, and the struggle between the two roads has not been resolved. Our political stand and thinking are not adapted to our changed socio-economic status, nor are they adapted to the objective economic foundation. The existence of this contradiction is an important issue in our political life.

Today's objective situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us industrialists and businessmen, whether in terms of work or transformation. The Party is taking such good care of us, the working people are uniting with us in such a way, and everyone is earnestly expecting us to make progress. We must not fail to live up to the expectations of the Party and the people. We must follow the instructions of the Party, study diligently, resolutely "focus on one side," focus on the side of the interests of the country and the people, resolutely "lean to one side," lean to the side of socialism, contribute our technology and experience without reservation, strengthen transformation in active service, and advance together with the people of the whole country. As long as we persist in doing so, we firmly believe that the bright future of the broad masses of the people is our future!

### 坚决地“顾一头”坚决地“一边倒”  胡厥文代表的发言

    坚决地“顾一头”坚决地“一边倒”
    胡厥文代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我以非常兴奋的心情，听到和学习了李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。这两份报告，使我进一步地认识到我国经济兴隆、财源茂盛、物价稳定、库存增加的良好情况，以及我们国家的国民经济以大跃进的速度飞跃发展的形势。我们国家的前途真是如花似锦，光芒万丈。作为新中国的一个人民，我实在感到无比的幸福和自豪。我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。
    我是一个工商业者，几十年来，从事机器工业，因此我对于报告中有关技术革新和技术革命的部分，特别感兴趣。两年来的连续大跃进，我们国家的社会主义建设已经开始了一个新的阶段，那就是国民经济以比第一个五年计划期间更高的速度持续地跃进。在这个大跃进中，我们国家一方面空前地提高了工、农业的产量，满足了国家建设和人民生活的需要；另一方面，由于大规模生产建设的突飞猛进，我们国家已经从一个劳动力过剩一变而为劳动力缺乏的国家。我们为了国民经济的持续跃进，我们必须在党的领导下，全民动员起来，大搞技术革新和技术革命，以解放劳动力和提高劳动生产率。这是当前增产节约运动的主要内容。
    技术革新层出不穷，它的潜力是无限的。看来好像是神话，而确实是活生生的现实。
    我在去年12月到北京来开民建会和工商联的代表大会，今年2月回到上海。真如中国有句古话：“士别三日，当刮目相看”。我离开上海仅三个月，整个的上海已经掀起了一个技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮。上海在各个战线上的面貌都变了，而且是大大地变了。就拿工业部分来说，上海的百余万工人群众，一方面正在努力改变手工操作和笨重的体力劳动，为机械化和半机械化，自动化和半自动化，摆脱落后的手工操作和笨重的体力劳动，争取继政治上、经济上翻身以后的“第二次解放”；另一方面又正在高速度地向高级、精密、尖端产品进军，人人立下雄心大志，要把上海建设成为全国高级、精密、尖端产品的工业基础之一，成为全国科学技术研究的中心之一。“一年之计在于春”，六十年代的第一个春季，上海的百余万工人群众就在生产战线上打了一场漂亮仗：全市试制成功的新产品、新花式达一万五千多种，其中新产品有五千五百多种，高级、精密、尖端产品有七百多种。
    这一次，上海人大代表和政协委员的视察中间，我虽因时间关系看得很少，仅看了几家工厂，但所到之处，没有一处的工人群众不是
  “见困难就上”，自觉地投入了波澜壮阔的技术革命运动中去的。他们对技术革新都像着了迷似的，个个都夜以继日、废寝忘食、你追我赶、共同跃进。他们用尽了心思，突破了“技术关”，一个创造发明紧接着一个创造发明，大家争把红旗插上技术的高峰。我看到一家金笔厂，产品中零件如笔尖、笔套、笔夹和笔舌等，原来每一件都是分好几道工序来做的。现在，试制成功了不少新机器，将三、四道，五、六道工序连续在一起做。很多人把这种操作法形象化了。他们说，从一道一道的工序联系起来成“一条小龙”，随着技术的进步，还要把“小龙”连系起来成为一条“大龙”。这样，增加了速度，减少了劳动力，而且还提高了质量。就生产设备的改进来说，有的厂新改进的设备方在试用，而更新更好的设备又在设计制造了。这种不断发展，不断革新和不断提高的情况不是过去所能想像的。
    我还看到一家录音机厂，它的录音机做好以后，原来是人工检验的，而且必须有很高技术的人才能胜任。一天最快只能检验四十部。现在改为自动检验，一个检验员也不要，每天可可检验八百部。自动检验是分为四个阶段连续进行的。每部录音机经过这四个阶段的检验，凡是完全合乎规格的，就自动地到成品间去了，如果哪一阶段检验不合格，就会自动做好记录，以后几个检验阶段就不再替它检验，它就自动地到修理间去了。修理人员就可以根据记录进行修理。这样的科学检验远比人工检验来得正确可靠。这个厂制造机器零件还利用录音机来自动控制生产程序。他们先将制造第一只的动作，速度、尺寸、大小记录在录音机磁带上，然后就用录音机来控制以后的生产，自动地一只一只地制造出来，规格千篇一律，异常正确。这些事例就足以证明在当前大跃进中，技术革新层出不穷，它的潜力是无限的。看来好像是神话，而确实是活生生的现实。
    人民公社大办工业的蓬勃气象，使我大受感动。
    特别给我深刻的印象，使我大受感动的，是人民公社大办工业的蓬勃气象。我亲眼看到一个公社所办的机器厂，全厂没有一个样子木匠，没有一个机器技工，没有一个翻砂技工，没有一个修理技工。总之，没有一个老师傅；有的只是一群农村青年男女。在迷信洋专家和洋设备的条件论者的眼光里，这个机器厂是不可能有什么作为的。但是这一群青年男女，去年今日还是在田间操作的农民，没有一点使用机器的经验，更不用说制造机器了，而现在他们都已经变成了工业战线上的能手了。这个厂的汽车修理部门不但具有小修的技术，而且能大修宕汽缸；不但能自己修理拖拉机，还可以协助运输公司修理运货车。它还制成了每次同时可以孵一万六千只小鸡的大型电气孵鸡器。在这个厂里，还有一个妇女技术小组，就凭着她们的那一股“闯劲”，试制成功了完全合乎规格的抽水泵、马达和电焊机，向“三八”妇女节献礼，得到了红旗小组的光荣称号。
    这班青年男女，对于技术的钻研如饥如渴，用他们自己的语言来说，如果不让他们干活，就等于不给他们饭吃。在他们的眼中，劳动，特别是为社会主义劳动，是娱乐、是一件最愉快的事情。
      据我所见所闻，上海近郊若干人民公社的工业产值，有的已经接近它的农业产值。这还是新生的萌芽，它有强大的生命力，就是把产量翻几番也并不困难，它的前途正未可限量。全国二万六千多个人民公社，普遍地开花了，将来个个社的工业产值都能够大大超过它的农业产值，这给国家将创造多少财富，这对于加速中国工业化将起多么巨大的作用，实在是难以估计的。
    人民公社办了工业，农具就可以自造、自修、自用，对于农业机械化的推进一定既切实而又迅速。农业机械化以后一个人抵上二十、三十人，可以解放出无限的劳动力来支援社办工业和国家的工业建设。
    人民公社办了工业，还可以使得大部分农民都能够有机会学到工业技术知识，为国家工业化培养后备技术力量。
    今天我们纵目四望，从城市到乡村，再从乡村到城市，到处是红旗招展，一片人人革新，事事革新，行行革新的热气腾腾的新气象。这就是在党的正确领导下，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众性的增产节约运动。这是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    面对声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动，工商业者应如何迎头赶上，是一个迫切的课题。
    面对着这样一个规模空前壮阔，声势无比浩大，内容极为丰富，效果特别显著的技术革新和技术革命运动，我们工商业者应如何迎头赶上，作出贡献，实在是一个迫切的课题。
    我们工商业者，有不少人是具有一定的生产技术和业务经验的，过去用来为资本主义服务，为个人利益服务；今天，如果用来为社会主义服务，为集体利益服务，这些技术和经验是可以起作用的。关键在于政治立场和世界观的改造。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指示我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”正是政治指导技术，技术体现政治。我们如果不在投入技术革命运动的同时，加强政治立场和世界观的改造，我们的生产技术和业务经验就根本不能发挥作用，甚至起反作用。因此，我们必须加强学习。
    李富春副总理在报告中说：“技术革新和技术革命运动应当同目前在全国各地广泛开展的学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，使运动有正确思想的指导。”我完全接受并且拥护李富春副总理的这个指示。今天我们工商界的多数人由于两面性依然存在，两条道路的斗争问题还未解决，我们的政治立场和思想，跟我们已经改变了的社会经济地位已经不相适应，跟客观的经济基础也不相适应。这个矛盾的存在，是我们政治生活中的重要问题。
    今天的客观形势，对我们工商业者，无论从工作或改造方面，都是空前有利的。党是这样的照顾我们，劳动人民是这样的团结我们，大家都是殷切地期待着我们进步。我们一定不能辜负党和人民对我们的期望，一定要遵照党的指示，认真学习，坚决地“顾一头”，顾国家和人民利益的一头，坚决地“一边倒”，倒向社会主义一边，把自己的技术和经验毫无保留地贡献出来，在积极服务中加强改造，跟全国人民一同前进。只要这样坚持不懈地做下去，我们深信，广大人民的光明前途就是我们的前途！
