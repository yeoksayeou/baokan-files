Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, backed by American bayonets, is raging like wildfire, growing ever stronger, and has reached an unprecedented scale today. Mass demonstrations involving over a hundred thousand people have erupted in Seoul and Busan, South Korea's two largest cities. Demonstrations have also taken place in cities such as Gwangju, Daegu, Incheon, and Cheongju.

In Seoul, the location of the Syngman Rhee "government," another 40,000 people held a large-scale demonstration for the second consecutive day. Angry crowds surrounded the South Korean puppet National Assembly and stormed the Central Government Building, the seat of the puppet regime's cabinet, tearing up documents in the offices. More than 10,000 students and citizens broke through the tight security of the Syngman Rhee group's police and charged towards Syngman Rhee's "official residence," Gyeongmudae, with some demonstrators reaching within thirty meters of Syngman Rhee's residence. They shouted slogans such as "Let us occupy Gyeongmudae!"

The Syngman Rhee group's military police opened fire and launched tear gas to suppress the demonstrators. The demonstrators launched a heroic counterattack.

The demonstrators burned down police substations and many of the Syngman Rhee group's military vehicles and cars.

The demonstrators also burned down the headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, the mouthpiece of the Syngman Rhee group, "Seoul Shinmun," and the headquarters of the "Korean Anti-Communist Youth Association," the "Anti-Communist Hall." Many people also held demonstrations in front of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime's "Ministry of Interior" and the "Supreme Court." Demonstrators everywhere shouted slogans: "Down with the dictatorial government!" "Abolish the March 15th presidential election!" "Release the students arrested in Masan!"

Many crowds also surrounded the residence of Lee Ki-bung, who was newly elected as "Vice President," and the "Central Broadcasting Station." They also attacked the headquarters of the Second Army of the Rhee's puppet army. They angrily sought to destroy the bronze statue of MacArthur, the commander of the US invading army.

The demonstrators heroically stormed the armory of the Seoul Police Bureau, seizing many pistols and carbines and using these weapons to fight the Syngman Rhee military police. Around 8:00 PM tonight, a group of people surrounded the Dongdaemun police substation. According to the World News Agency, these people fought with the police. This news agency also reported that another group attacked a police substation and captured forty rifles.

Haptong News Agency reported that the demonstrators had seized all the fire engines in Seoul used by the Syngman Rhee group for suppression.

An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul acknowledged that the Syngman Rhee group's "government officials are uneasy," and today's situation puts the Syngman Rhee group "at risk of facing the biggest crisis since the Korean War."

The Syngman Rhee group, frightened by the South Korean people's demonstrations, today ordered special martial law in five major cities: Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, and Daejeon, implementing a curfew from 7:00 PM to 5:00 AM, and ordered all schools at all levels in Seoul and major middle schools in all regions to suspend classes and prohibit all gatherings.

In addition, Syngman Rhee hastily mobilized a division of troops today, including tanks, armored vehicles, and rocket launchers, into Seoul to suppress the demonstrators and opened fire on the crowds. According to the Dongyang News Agency, as of 9:30 PM tonight, eighty-one demonstrators were killed and three hundred and two were injured in Seoul. The streets of Seoul were littered with corpses and wounded people.

In the southern port city of Busan, 70,000 people participated in the demonstration. Angry crowds surrounded and burned down the Busan Police Station, destroyed two police substations, and many guard posts.

Today's mass demonstration in Busan started at 2:00 PM, beginning with over three thousand students and civilians demonstrating, which was suppressed by the police, resulting in three people being killed or injured. The angry crowds grew larger, burning several police cars and fighting the police with stones and water cannons seized from the police. In Gwangju in the southwest, more than 20,000 students and citizens began demonstrating at 2:00 PM today, destroying the Gwangju City branch of the Liberal Party and the Gwangju Police Station. They also surrounded the South Jeolla Province "government" office building.

At 3:00 PM today, more than 1,000 students from Kyungpook National University in Daegu broke through the school gate and held a demonstration, which is still ongoing.

In Incheon, more than 300 students held a demonstration in the city this morning. The students used stones to fight back against the Syngman Rhee armed police who were attempting to obstruct their demonstration, and hit the fire trucks that the police drove to suppress them. The demonstrators' fighting spirit was very high.

In Cheongju, south of Seoul, more than 1,000 students also held a demonstration to resist Syngman Rhee's dark rule.

This situation has caused serious anxiety to Syngman Rhee's master, the United States, and has torn off the mask of "non-interference." The United States "Embassy" in South Korea today openly issued a statement, asking the demonstrators to seriously consider the consequences of their actions and immediately "restore law and order."

Meanwhile, it was reported that a US State Department spokesman issued a statement on the 18th, reiterating that the US government is "deeply concerned" about the events in South Korea and is "closely watching the development of the situation."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: Seoul dispatch: Encouraged by the Masan people's demonstration struggle, people in various parts of South Korea have risen up to launch struggles against the Syngman Rhee group.

In Cheongju City, North Chungcheong Province, more than 1,000 students held a demonstration on the 18th. According to the South Korean News Agency, around 1:30 PM that afternoon, students from Cheongju Commercial High School, Cheongju High School, and Cheongju Industrial High School joined together to hold a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "The government must be responsible for the Masan incident" and "Do not interfere with students."

The puppet police rushed to suppress them, and the students resisted with stones, engaging in a fierce and prolonged fight with the puppet police. It was reported that more than 100 students were arrested by the police.

According to Tonghwa News Agency, around 11:40 AM on the 18th, more than 70 farmers in the outskirts of Ulsan, shouting the slogan "Quickly repair the embankment," rushed into the Ulsan County puppet government and staged a sit-in protest.
