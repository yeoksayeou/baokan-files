    The Fragrance of Spring Flowers Fills Every Home
    ——A Record of the Birth and Growth of the Zhengzhou Hongqi People's Commune
    By our reporter Zhang Lizhong
    In the northeast corner of Zhengzhou, there is a street of about eighty households – Qingzhensi (Mosque) Street. Living on this street are masons, rickshaw pullers, small vendors, and some people without fixed occupations. In the old society, it was a street known for its poverty. After liberation, although most people had fixed jobs and their lives gradually improved, there were still a few people who, due to weak labor or physical defects, had a thin family fortune that could not withstand the attacks of natural and man-made disasters. The government had to issue relief funds of about 10,000 yuan every year to help the poor households on this street. Poverty leads to change. Precisely because they were poor, they were the first to raise the red flag on the streets of Zhengzhou and organize themselves for collective production and collective life. Even before the rural areas established people's communes, they had essentially started doing the work of people's communes.
    This happened in May 1958.
    At this time, the wave of the Great Leap Forward swept the country. The housewives of Qingzhensi Street had long been spurred by this heat wave. Everyone was encouraging each other and discussing the need to participate in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. Gai Xiurong, the director of the residents' committee of Qingzhensi Street and the secretary of the Communist Party branch, saw such demands from the broad masses of housewives and considered: What a great force this is! We must rely on our own efforts to organize these people to engage in production on the street. She told her neighbors about organizing a street production group, and a dozen households of housewives immediately responded. What kind of production should they do? For many years, housewives had only looked after children, cooked meals, or done some needlework. After discussing for a long time, they decided to start with what they knew. They decided to make soles, fold masks, and paste dyed bags. Without capital, they decided to start with processing work. Gai Xiurong personally went to the department store to make contact. The superiority of collective production was clearly demonstrated. First of all, everyone learned from each other's strengths, taught each other, and improved their skills. The quality of all the work processed by them was very good. They quickly established a reputation in various departments. More and more departments sought them for processing work, and they developed the processing of sandpaper, making black alum, and boiling sugar syrup. In the past, individual households also did some processing work, but they were busy doing work at home and could not contact suppliers outside. After organizing, the production group also had "diplomats" who specialized in contacting suppliers outside, so people at home could concentrate on production. They could also compete with each other.
    Established a Socialist Courtyard
    The superiority of collective production attracted the surrounding masses, and soon it developed to twenty-one households. They were divided into various production groups according to different types of work such as making soles and pasting paper bags. As the scope of production expanded, it became apparent that the space was too narrow to work in each household's dormitory. These people were determined to do a good job in production. If they couldn't fit inside the house, they worked under the trees in the courtyard. On rainy days, they ran to the nearby square's stage to work. Although the enthusiasm for production was great, each person had an average of two or three children under the age of six. While working, this child wanted to be breastfed, and that child wanted to eat a steamed bun, so the working women couldn't settle down. Du Shuixian was very active in production, but she had four children, one of whom had just learned to walk, and one was still breastfeeding. When working, she always carried the child in her arms. People gave her the nickname "Double-Headed Woman." In this way, their energy was distracted, and work efficiency was always low. Du Shuixian said angrily, "As long as the child problem is solved, I dare to climb mountains and catch tigers." Another problem that was difficult to solve was the problem of cooking. The husbands of these women were all working, and everyone had to ensure that their spouses had meals on time. Although the women were particularly enthusiastic about production, they still had to get up early and cook in the dark to prepare meals after their spouses and children had eaten and washed the pots before they could formally start work.
    The contradiction between working, cooking, and taking care of children brought distress to every member of this production organization. When there was no other way, Jia Xiuying sighed and said, "How great would it be if we could be like a factory, with a canteen for meals and a nursery for children!" This sentence expressed everyone's inner thoughts. Gai Xiurong, the branch secretary on this street, was inspired by this and discussed with everyone: How about we set up a canteen and a nursery ourselves? When she asked everyone, those around her raised their hands in support. Du Shuixian, who used to be called "Double-Headed Woman," was particularly excited when she heard this. She said loudly, "My good branch secretary, why didn't you say it earlier? These days have been very difficult for me. We have been asking for this for a long time." Before she finished speaking, Mu Daniu threw her arm out, "Good! My family has three flour vats and a measuring cup. I will immediately take them out and lend them to our canteen." Ba Fenglan used to sell steamed buns and brought out a large chopping board from her home. Zhao Zongying took out a kitchen knife, and Gai Xiurong took out a rice spoon and a measuring cup. Some brought dustpans, some carried large pots, and even rolling pins and small oil cans were brought out. In less than two hours, they had gathered all the cooking utensils. With the tools, there was still no house to use as a canteen. This difficulty did not stop everyone's enthusiasm for collective life. Ding Wenxiang, who had a relatively spacious house, immediately offered to give up two rooms of her own. Aunt Ding did not fall behind and immediately took action to vacate two rooms as well. Wang Juhua gave up three rooms. This way, they not only had a kitchen, but also a nursery and a production workshop. Du Xiuzhen, who could fry and stir-fry, immediately signed up to be the cook, which was applauded and welcomed by everyone. Lu Jinling, who was young, lively, could sing and dance, signed up to be a childcare worker, bringing comfort and encouragement to these children's mothers. Fifteen breastfeeding children entered the breastfeeding room, thirty-five young children entered the nursery class, and more than one hundred people ate together. The production and life of twenty-one households were connected. However, the nursery, canteen, and production workshop were scattered in three closely adjacent courtyards. Everyone generally felt that the original small courtyards were very inconvenient and demanded that the small courtyard be turned into a large courtyard. Gai Xiurong led everyone to tear down three walls, and the three courtyards were connected into one courtyard. This new production relationship and lifestyle closely connected people who had always lived individually. People rejoiced in their new life and loved their collective. Everyone thought and discussed during production: They gave this large courtyard a name called "Socialist Courtyard."
    "Courtyard" brought far-reaching ideals
    The "Socialist Courtyard" organized collective life. The women were in good spirits and their production efficiency increased sharply. They guaranteed eight hours of work a day, and the general work efficiency doubled. Ding Junniao used to only fold two dozen masks a day. Since she no longer cooked or took care of children, she immediately increased to five dozen. Ma Xiuyun used to be the slowest person in making soles. Since the problem of cooking and taking care of children was solved, she increased from making one sole a day to three. Their good life and high production enthusiasm quickly attracted many visitors. Ma Xiuzhi, the leader of the first group of residents on this street, took several women to visit the "Socialist Courtyard" and complained to Gai Xiurong, "You only lead this courtyard. You can't just abandon us outside. If you don't have time to lead, we will do it ourselves. We have already vacated the house." There were eight groups on this street, all of which automatically discussed merging two groups into one and automatically pooled cooking utensils and found houses. In two days, they did everything from vacating houses to building stoves and set up four public canteens.
    Being organized brought strength to the people, and the collective cultivated people's far-reaching ideals. The actions of the Socialist Courtyard had a profound impact on Qingzhensi Street. After more than a month of collective production, they had a certain amount of production funds. Should they be distributed to everyone? Or should they expand public accumulation? The vast majority of people saw the far-reaching prospects of collective production and decided to fight hard for three months. All income would be used as public accumulation to expand reproduction. This increasingly strong seedling attracted people. The courtyard had started collective production early and had a lot of supplies. The people in the courtyard were very busy every day, but they still couldn't finish processing all the work. Other production groups on this street had fewer supplies because they had just been organized. The people in the courtyard took the initiative to give the supplies they had contacted to other groups for processing. Because the courtyard's kindergarten was the first of its kind, some women in other groups who had joined the production had many children and were tired. They were willing to send their children to the "Courtyard's" kindergarten. The people in the courtyard thought that they should not only do a good job in production themselves, but also drive the whole street. Therefore, all the children who wanted to enter the kindergarten were accepted. The production and life of Qingzhensi Street naturally formed around the "Courtyard" as the core. In addition, each production group was processing work for state-owned companies. When receiving materials, each group received its own, which added a lot of trouble to the employees of the company. After discussion at the residents' meeting of the whole street, everyone unanimously agreed to merge.
    The whole street joined together to run industry, and a new change occurred. This street gradually increased from the original processing production (shoe soles, pasting paper bags, spinning hemp, etc.) to self-produced and self-sold production (shoe factories, clothing factories, radio speaker factories, saltpeter boiling factories, refractory material factories, etc.). The establishment of these factories was well received by society. At that time, a nationwide high tide of the Great Leap Forward had formed, and everyone participated in production. People who used to make clothes by hand no longer did so, but came to the sewing factory to do so. At that time, everyone was making steel, and the refractory bricks they made were always in short supply. The speakers used for wired broadcasting were completely ordered by various places before they were produced. The situation of the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture prompted the street-run industry to develop rapidly. During this period, some scattered industries were set up in various streets, and they all needed to be developed rapidly. However, the strength of a street with only eighty households was limited, and each street had its own weaknesses. The refractory material factory on Qingzhensi Street was located in an alley. To transport refractory materials in and refractory bricks out, they had to be carried from the street. The factory was very small and could only accommodate one kiln. The refractory material factory on Dongdajie (East Main Street) was close to the street, and it was convenient to transport materials. The place was large, and it didn't matter if several more kilns were built. However, they didn't have a transportation group, and sometimes they had to ask the Qingzhensi Street transportation group for help to transport things. The flour mill on Qingzhensi Street had foot-pedaled sieves, which were efficient and used for half a day and idle for half a day. The flour mill on Dongdajie only had hand sieves, which were slow and chaotic. The shoe factory on Dongdajie had shoe-making machines, and the shoe factory on Qingzhensi Street had shoe-upper sewing machines. In daily contact, the cadres and masses on the two streets all felt that it was too inconvenient to produce on one street, and further development was greatly limited. There were great benefits to merging several streets. At this time – on August 9, 1958, Chairman Mao pointed out during his inspection in Shandong: "It is better to set up people's communes." The broad masses drew inspiration from this sentence. On August 15, under the leadership of the District Committee of the Communist Party, the Hongqi People's Commune with four thousand six hundred and eighty-three households came into being.
    Collective Production and New Changes
    The establishment of the urban people's commune demonstrated its strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. The entire commune consisted of twenty-two natural streets. Before communization, except for the unified leadership of the production of each group on Qingzhensi Street, other streets produced together in small collectives of three or five. The commune was established and immediately merged factories of similar nature. For example, the two refractory brick factories on the two streets originally had two sets of management personnel such as factory directors and accountants. After the establishment of the commune, they were merged, which not only saved a set of management personnel and some workers, but also expanded the factory site and made it easier to develop. After the commune's means of production and funds were concentrated, its strength became even stronger. Originally, the small factories on each street only had ten or so people. After communization, including mergers and new construction, forty-seven were built at once, including factories for electrical machinery repair, chemical industry, coking, construction, carpentry, flour, oilcloth, refractory bricks, sandpaper, and sewing. The number of employed people increased from more than two hundred to more than nine hundred and fifty. With more people, there was more strength. After the factories were built, people didn't know the technology. The commune immediately leveraged the superiority of having a large number of people and a wide range, concentrating seventy-eight old repair workers, small handicraft workers, and various skilled people from the entire commune. Forty-five old workers were invited from large factories as teachers and assigned to various factories to teach technology. Before the establishment of the commune, street-run industry only had seven or eight kinds of products. After the establishment of the commune, it quickly reached twenty-three kinds. In July 1958, before the establishment of the commune, the total output value of street industry was 700 yuan. In August, the commune was established, and in December, the monthly output value reached 190,000 yuan. Such high-speed development was not limited to one factory. After the establishment of the commune, people were organized to launch a technical revolution. In one year, 637 innovation experts emerged, and the entire commune realized more than 1,300 technical innovations, and manufactured 460 sets of indigenous machines and tools. 90% of the workers in the electrical machinery factory were women, and even the foreman and workshop director were housewives from a year ago. Who had ever seen a generator a year ago! But now, the women draw copper wire themselves, make yarn-wrapped wire themselves. Han Shuxiu, the director of the repair workshop, is the mother of four children. A year ago, she was a housewife revolving around the stove. Now, she talks about motors with great expertise. In the commune, everyone had a suitable job. The blind people rock the machines in the noodle factory and the hemp spinning factory, and seven cripples were arranged to work as accountants and sewing. It is truly "making the best use of people" and "making the best use of things." The wages of the members increased from seven yuan to thirteen yuan, and from thirteen yuan to the current average of twenty-three yuan. The commune has a wide scope of operations, and it has also engaged in some non-staple food production. It cultivates a total of 1,699 mu of land, and has a professional team of more than 950 people. In the past year, it has produced more than 11 million jin of vegetables to supply the market. The variety of vegetables has increased from twenty-five to fifty-three. They also raised more than 1,000 pigs, 980 sheep, 5,000 chickens, 60,000 fish, and more than 200 ducks, improving the lives of the members.
    The Ideological Leap Forward of the Masses
    The establishment of the commune began to change the face of the city. The Hongqi Commune was originally the poorest place in Zhengzhou. Now, it is constantly changing. Construction scaffolding is being erected, and before it is dismantled on this side, it is being built on the other side. In the past year, more than 3,700 houses have been newly built and repaired, 15 streets have been renovated, and 300,000 trees have been planted on both sides of the tidy streets, giving the dilapidated streets a new look. In the main streets, 58 public canteens, 15 nurseries and kindergartens, and 171 service points have been established. Now people are further transforming the old environment and are building a new residential area with a production plant, member dormitories, welfare facilities, commercial service points, and schools with an area of ​​more than 25,000 square meters.
    Everything is changing rapidly, but the biggest change is in the people here. In the past, in the Qingzhensi Street area, the streets and alleys were filled with housewives rushing to the streets with vegetable baskets every morning, and that was how they started their day. Now, every morning, the women are also in groups, but they walk into the factory laughing and chatting, and start a happy and intense day of work. After the establishment of the commune, 2,648 women were liberated from their labor. Collective production and collective life have given people so much wisdom and strength. A year ago, housewives are now leading factories with hundreds of people and can manage the production and life of thousands of people. Eleven of the nineteen branch secretaries of the major factories in Hongqi Commune were housewives from a year ago, and all nine branch chiefs of the commune were housewives from a year ago. Collective production and collective life also constantly improve people's collectivist ideology. Before communization, among the 82 residents of Qingzhensi Street, there were 28 households with family discord and neighborhood disharmony, and the street office had to mediate more than ten civil disputes every day. Now, all the children have entered nurseries, and the adults are all engaged in collective production and collective life, and there is not even any bickering. Ma Shijiang and Ba Shiren were neighbors separated by a wall, and the adults in the two families had not spoken for seven years because their children were fighting. After the establishment of the commune, they ate in the same canteen and worked in the same production group. Collective production connected them together and solved the knot of years of discord. Now, let's take a look at the changes in the "Socialist Courtyard," which took the lead in establishing the commune. Before the establishment of the commune, only eight men in this courtyard had work to do. Because two households in this courtyard had weak labor, the government had to issue a relief fund of 50 yuan to this courtyard every month. After the establishment of the commune, fifteen housewives were liberated and participated in production, and now these people have become the backbone of the commune's cause. Ma Xiuzhi became a model in the chemical factory, and Du Xiuzhen became a model in the chicken and duck factory. The other models in this courtyard include Lu Jinling, Zhang Fengying, and Sun Yumei. Gai Xiurong, the organizer of the courtyard, is now the director of the Guancheng District branch of this commune. Due to the changes in the entire life, the members are now singing: In the past, housework was chaotic, and you had to fetch children and cook. Chairman Mao led the翻了身, and now he runs the commune again. If you want to eat, there is a canteen, and there are service stations for dismantling, washing, sewing, and mending. The children have entered the nursery, and the elderly have entered the Happiness Home. Monthly wages are paid, and life is getting more and more comfortable.

    迎春花开万家香
    ——记郑州市红旗人民公社的诞生和成长
    本报记者　张励中
    郑州市的东北角，有条八十来户的街道——清真寺街，在这条街上居住的是泥瓦工、三轮车工人、小商贩，还有一些没有固定职业的人。在旧社会，是一条穷得出名的街道。解放后，虽然大部分人都有了固定的职业，生活上慢慢的好起来了。但是，还有少数的人，因为劳力弱或是身体上有缺陷，家底薄经不住天灾人祸的袭击，政府每年还要发放救济款一万来元，救济这条街的贫困户。穷则思变，正是因为这里穷，他们首先在郑州市街道上插起红旗，组织起来集体生产和集体生活。在农村还未建立起人民公社的时候，他们这里实质上已经办起人民公社的事来了。
    这件事情发生在1958年的5月。
    这时候，大跃进的浪潮席卷全国，清真寺街的家庭妇女们，早就被这种热浪催动，大家都在互相鼓动着彼此议论着，要求参加到大跃进的行列里。清真寺街的居民委员会主任、中共支部书记盖秀荣，看到广大家庭妇女的这样要求，就考虑：这是一批多大的力量啊！要自力更生，把这些人组织起来，在街道上搞生产。她向邻居们说了一声组织街道生产小组，左邻右舍的十来户家庭妇女马上响应，搞什么生产呢？多少年来，家庭妇女只是看孩子，做饭，再不然就是做点针线，商量了半天，还是先从自己会的干起。确定纳鞋底、叠口罩、糊染色袋等。没有本钱，就决定先搞加工活，盖秀荣亲自跑到百货公司联络，集体生产的优越性很明显的显示出来，首先是大家取长补短互教互学提高技术，凡是从她们手里加工的活，质量都很好。很快在各部门建立了信誉，找她们加工的部门多了，她们又发展了加工砂纸，做黑矾，熬糖稀。过去单门独户也有的找一些加工活做，但顾了在家做活，顾不了到外边联络货源，组织起来后，生产组里也有了“外交官”，专门到外边联络货源，家里的人们可以专心搞生产。还可以互相竞赛。
    建立了社会主义大院
    集体生产的优越性，吸引着周围的群众，很快就发展到二十一户。她们按纳鞋底、糊纸袋等不同工种，分成各种生产小组。生产范围一扩大，原来在每家宿舍做工就显得地方窄了。这些人，决心搞好生产，屋里容不下，就到院内树底下做活，下雨天，就跑到附近广场戏台上干。生产劲头虽然很大，但每个人平均都有两、三个六岁以下的孩子，生产的时候，这个孩子要吃奶，那个孩子要吃馍，做工的妇女安不下心来。杜水仙生产很积极，就是有四个孩子，其中一个刚会走，一个还在吃奶，做工的时候，怀里总是揣着孩子，人们给她起了外号叫“双头人”。这样，分散精力，工作效率总是提不高，气的杜水仙说：“只要把孩子问题解决了，叫我上山掏老虎也敢干，”另外还有个问题不好解决，就是做饭问题，这些妇女的爱人都在做工，每个人都要保证自己的爱人按时吃好饭，尽管妇女们特别热心生产，每天还是一定起早搭黑的做饭，要在爱人、孩子吃完饭、刷完锅后，才能正式工作。
    做工和做饭、看孩子的矛盾，给这个生产组织的每个成员带来了苦闷，在没有办法的时候，贾秀英叹息地说：“咱们什么时候像工厂那样，吃饭有食堂，孩子有托儿所，那可多么好啊！”这一句，说出了每个人的心里话，这个街上的支部书记盖秀荣，听了以后得到了启发，就和大家商量：咱们自己成立一个食堂，成立一个托儿所行不行，她一问大家，周围的人都举起双手来拥护，原来被人唤做“双头人”的杜水仙，听了特别兴奋，她大声说：“我的好支书，你怎么早不说，这些日子可把我难为得不轻，我们早就有这个要求啊。”她的话音未落，穆大妞把胳臂一抛，“好！我家有三个面缸、一个巴斗，我马上拿出来借给咱们食堂用。”巴凤兰过去卖过蒸馍，回家搬出来一块大案板，赵宗英拿出一把菜刀，盖秀荣拿出饭勺和巴斗，有的拿簸罗，有的扛大锅，甚至连擀面棍和小油罐都拿出来了，不到两个小时，就把灶具凑齐了。有了工具，还没有作食堂的房子，这点困难也没有挡住大家搞集体生活的热情，房子比较宽裕的丁文香当场表示让出自己的两间房，丁大娘并不落后，马上也动手腾出两间房，王菊花让出三间房，这一来，不光有了厨房，连托儿所和生产车间也有了，谁做饭？能炸会炒的杜修真，当场报名当炊事员，受到大家鼓掌欢迎。年青活泼，能歌善舞的吕金岭，报名当保育员，给这些孩子的妈妈们，带来了欣慰和鼓舞。有十五个吃奶的孩子进了哺乳室，三十五个幼儿进了托儿班，一百多口人在一起吃饭。二十一户人家生产生活连在一起了。但是，托儿所、食堂、生产车间分散在紧紧相靠的三个院子，大家普遍感到原来的小院子有很多不方便，要求把小院变成大院。盖秀荣带领大家推倒三堵墙，三所院连成一个院。这种新的生产关系和生活方式，把一向个体生活的人紧紧的连接在一起了，人们庆幸自己的新生活，热爱自己的集体，大家在生产的时候想啊商量啊：给这个大院起了个名子叫“社会主义大院”。
    “大院”带来了远大理想
    “社会主义大院”组织起来集体生活，妇女们精神愉快，生产效率猛然提高，一天保证工作八个小时，一般工效提高一倍，丁俊鸟原来一天只叠两打口罩，自从她不做饭不看孩子以后，马上增加到五打，马秀云原来是纳鞋底最慢的人，自从做饭、看孩子的问题解决后，由一天纳一只猛增到三只。她们这种生活搞的好生产干劲高的事实，很快的吸引来很多人参观。这条街的居民第一组的组长马秀芝带着几个妇女到“社会主义大院”参观了以后，就找盖秀荣埋怨说：“你光领导这个大院，想把我们抛到外边可不行，你没有时间领导，我们自己办，我们早就腾好房子啦。”她这条街共有八个组，都是两个组自动商量合并一个伙，自动凑灶具，找房子，两天的时间，连腾房子带垒锅台，什么都搞好了，办起四个公共食堂。
    组织起来，给人们带来了力量，集体，培养了人们的远大理想。社会主义大院的一举一动，在清真寺街起了深刻的影响。一个多月的集体生产，有了一定的生产资金了，是分给每一个人？还是扩大公共积累？绝大多数人看到集体生产的远大前途，决定苦战三个月，所有的收入全部作为公共积累，扩大再生产。这个越来越壮的幼苗，吸引着人们。大院集体生产搞的早、货源多，每天大院人们很忙，但该加工的活计还是弄不完，而这条街的其他生产组，因为刚刚组织起来，货源比较少。大院的人们，主动把自己联络来的货源让给别的组加工。大院的幼儿园因是首创，其他组有些妇女参加了生产，孩子多了累手，都愿意把孩子送入“大院”的幼儿园，大院的人们，想到不光自己要搞好生产，也要带动全街。因此，要求入园的孩子都吸收了。清真寺街的生产和生活，很自然的形成了以“大院”为核心。再加上各个生产组都是给国营公司加工活计，领料的时候，各组领各组的，给公司的职工增添了不少麻烦。经过全街居民大会讨论，大家一致同意合并。
    全街合在一起办工业，又起了一个新的变化。这条街由原来的加工生产（鞋底、糊纸袋、纺麻等），逐渐增加了自产自销的生产（制鞋厂、被服厂、广播喇叭厂、熬硝厂、耐火材料厂等）。这些工厂的建立，深受社会欢迎。当时已经形成全民性的跃进高潮，大家都参加了生产，原来用手工做衣服的人，现在不做了，要到缝纫厂来做。当时正是全民办钢铁，他们制成的耐火砖，总是供不应求。有线广播用的喇叭，不等生产出来，就被各地订购完了。工农业全面跃进的形势，促使这个街道办工业要迅速发展。这时期，各个街道都办起了一些零散的工业，都需要迅速发展。但一条八十多户的街道，力量是有限的，每个街都有自己的弱点。清真寺街耐火材料厂设在一条胡同里，运进耐火材料和运出耐火砖，都要从大街往里抬，厂的地方很小，只能容一个窑，而东大街的耐火材料厂，紧靠大街，运送材料交通方便，地方大，再扩建几个窑也没有关系，但是他们没有运输组，有时运送东西要请清真寺街运输组来帮忙。清真寺的面粉厂有脚蹬箩，因为效率高，用一天闲半天，东大街面粉厂只有手箩，速度慢，手忙脚乱面粉箩不完。东大街制鞋厂有纳鞋机，清真寺街制鞋厂有缝鞋帮机。两条街道上的干部和群众在日常接触中，都共同感觉一个街道生产太不方便，再发展受到很大限制，几个街道合并起来有很大好处。这时——1958年8月9日毛主席在山东视察时指出：“还是办人民公社好”。广大群众从这句话里得到了启发。8月15日，在中共区委会的领导下，四千六百八十三户的红旗人民公社就应运而生了。
    集体生产和新的变化
    城市人民公社一经建立就显示了它的强大生命力和无比优越性。全公社是二十二条自然街，公社化前，除了清真寺街的各个小组的生产统一领导外，其它街道都是三一群五一伙的在一起生产，是个很小的集体。公社建起来后，马上把同类性质的工厂合并了。比如两个街的耐火砖厂，原来两套厂长、会计等管理人员，建立公社后合并了，不但节省了一套管理人员和一部分工人，而且厂址扩大、更便于发展了。公社的生产资料和资金集中起来后，力量更雄厚了。原来各个街道的小工厂只不过十来个，公社化后，连合并带新建，一下子搞了四十七个，其中有电机修配、化工、炼焦、建筑、木器、面粉、油布、耐火砖、砂布、缝纫等厂，就业人数由二百多人一下子发展到九百五十多人。人多力量大，工厂建起人们都不会技术，公社马上发挥人多范围大的优越性，把全社范围内的修配老工人、小手工业者及各种有技术的七十八人集中起来，又到大工厂请来四十五名老工人作老师，分到各工厂教技术。建社前街道办工业只有七、八种产品，建公社后很快就达到二十三种，建社前的1958年的7月，街道工业总产值七百元，8月建社，12月月产值就达到十九万元。
  千年万年不如公社一年
    究竟现在怎样了？这里群众有句俗话：“千年万年，不如公社一年。”一年多来工业上得到特大的发展。全公社参加工作的三千四百零八人，妇女占两千六百四十八人，其中除了四百三十人到国营企业外，其余都参加了公社工业和各种福利事业。现在，全公社的产品已达二百四十二种，公共积累五十五万多元。2月的一个月的产值，就到三百五十六万元，比去年7月份产值增长近十九倍。原来是熬硝小组的化工厂，建公社时只有十二人，八口大锅，三间草棚，只生产火硝和小盐，一年多来，社员们用自己家里的吃水缸、面盆当作生产硫酸、硝酸、盐酸和火碱的设备，利用一块一百三十亩的盐碱地做原料来源，采用土法大搞综合利用，大量生产了“三酸”、“两碱”、氧化镁、漂白粉、刷鞋粉、水玻璃、油酸等二十五种化工产品，月产值达十六万多元，已经成为一百六十多名职工的大厂了。像这样的高速度发展，不是一个厂。公社建立后，就组织人们大闹技术革命，一年来出现六百三十七名革新能手，全社实现革新技术一千三百多项，自制土机器和土工具四百六十台。电机制造厂的工人，90％都是妇女，甚至工长、车间主任也是一年前的家庭妇女。一年前谁见过发电机啊！可是现在，妇女们自己抽铜丝，自己制纱包线，修配车间主任韩淑秀，是四个孩子的妈妈，一年前她还是围锅台转的家庭妇女，现在，她谈起电机来头头是道。在公社里不管什么人都有了合适的工作，盲人到面条厂、纺麻厂摇机器，七个跛子安排作会计和缝纫工作，真是作到“人尽其才”，“物尽其用”。社员的工资由七元到十三元，由十三元到现在的平均二十三元。公社经营范围广，自己又搞了一些副食品生产，共种地一千六百九十九亩，有九百五十多人的专业队，一年来生产蔬菜供应市场一千一百多万斤。蔬菜的品种由二十五种增加到五十三种。他们还养了一千多头猪，九百八十多只羊，五千只鸡，六万尾鱼和二百多只鸭，改善了社员的生活。
    群众的思想飞跃前进
    公社的建立，开始改变着城市的面貌，红旗公社原是郑州市最穷的地方，现在，这里时时都在变化着，建筑脚手架，这边没拆，那边又建起来了。一年来，这里新建与修理房子三千七百多间，整理了十五条街道，在整齐的街道两旁，种植了三十万株树木，使破旧的街道焕然一新。在主要街道中，兴办了五十八处公共食堂，十五个托儿所与幼儿园，一百七十一个服务点。现在人们正进一步改造旧有环境，正在兴建着一个拥有生产厂房、社员宿舍、福利设施、商业服务点、学校在内的面积达两万五千多平方米的新型居民点。
    一切都在飞跃地变化着，但变化最大的是这里的人。过去，清真寺街这一带，每天早晨起来，大街小巷匆匆奔走的都是手提菜篮的家庭妇女，就这样开始了一天的生活。现在，每天早上，妇女们也是成群结队，但是说说笑笑地走进了工厂，开始了一天的愉快而紧张的劳动。建社后，解放妇女劳力两千六百四十八人。集体生产和集体生活给了人们多少智慧和力量，一年前的家庭妇女，现在要领导几百个人的工厂，能管理几千人的生产和生活。红旗公社十九个大厂的支部书记有十一个是一年前的家庭妇女，全公社九个分社社长，完全是一年前的家庭妇女。集体生产和集体生活，也不断地提高人们的集体主义思想。公社化前，清真寺街八十二户居民中，家庭不和、邻里不睦的有二十八户，每天街道办事处要调解民事纠纷十余起。现在，小孩们全入了托儿所，大人都集体生产和集体生活，连顶嘴的也没有了。马世江与巴世仁是隔墙邻居，因小孩打架惹得两家大人七年没说话，建社后在一个食堂吃饭，在一个生产组工作，集体生产把他们连系在一起，解开了多年不和的疙瘩。现在，我们再来看看，曾经带头办公社的“社会主义大院”的变化。这个大院在公社化前，只有八个男人有工作干，因为这院有两户劳力不强，政府每月要发放给这个院五十元的救济金。公社化后，十五个家庭妇女解放了出来，参加了生产，现在这些人已成了公社事业的骨干。马秀芝在化工厂当了模范，杜秀珍在鸡鸭厂当了模范，这个院当模范的还有吕金岭、张凤英、孙玉梅。大院的组织者盖秀荣现在是这个公社的管城区分社主任。由于整个生活的变化，现在社员们唱着：过去家务心操乱，引孩作饭都得干。毛主席领导翻了身，如今又把公社办。若想吃饭有食堂，拆、洗、缝、补服务站。小孩入了托儿所，老人进了幸福院。月月工资发到手，生活越过越舒坦。
