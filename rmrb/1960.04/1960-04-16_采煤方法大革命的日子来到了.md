The day of revolution in coal mining methods has arrived.
We have set ambitious goals: to create within a few years a set of coal mining science and technology that suits the characteristics of our country's coal mines, possesses a unique style, and is the most advanced, most reasonable, and most complete.
Representative Wang Dezhi speaks on behalf of representatives of coal science research work:
I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) ahead of schedule.
Now I would like to express some opinions on the coal industry and its science and technology.
In 1959, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country shattered the attack of the right-leaning opportunists, adhered to the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, pushing our country's socialist construction to a new stage and enabling all aspects of our country's industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, and education to achieve a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, completing the main targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This great achievement powerfully shattered the slander and defamation of imperialism and hostile forces at home and abroad and greatly encouraged and supported the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world.
Like the national situation, the coal industry achieved a Great Leap Forward in 1959 with both proportion and high speed. Following the surpassing of Britain's coal production in 1958, there was another significant increase in 1959, with a total of 347.8 million tons of raw coal produced throughout the year, an increase of 28.8% over 1958. Not only did coal production achieve a Great Leap Forward, but coal science and technology also made great achievements and achieved high-speed development.

Several Experiences in Achieving Success in Coal Industry Scientific Research
The reason why the coal industry and its science and technology can achieve the above-mentioned great achievements is, in addition to relying on the absolute leadership of the Party, there are also the following points of experience:

One, Adhere to Putting Politics in Command
Adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in all revolutionary and construction undertakings. In the past few years, the coal industry front has witnessed the struggle between two ideologies and two lines: one is to adhere to putting politics in command, using the spirit of continuous revolution and the method of vigorously launching mass movements to manage coal mining enterprises; the other is to adhere to "putting technology and business in command," relying on a few people and rules and regulations to manage coal mining enterprises steadily and quietly. Millions of facts have proven that the former is the Marxist-Leninist point of view and method and the correct line for developing the coal industry at a high speed with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; the latter is a non-proletarian point of view and method and the wrong line for developing the coal industry at a low speed with less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. In the process of the struggle between these two lines for more than two years, we have adhered to the former correct line, constantly criticized the latter wrong line, and solved the production and need issues, active balance issues, the relationship between normal production and shock work, and the relationship between production and capital construction for the high-speed development of the coal industry in theory and practical work. Because we have adhered to putting politics in command and earnestly solved the above-mentioned major problems, the face of the coal industry has changed rapidly and in a myriad of ways.

Two, Carry out the Red Flag Emulation Campaign for Large-Area High Yield
In 1959, the red flag emulation campaign for large-area high yield carried out on the coal industry front effectively mobilized the positive factors in all aspects, correctly handled the contradictions between advanced and backward in coal mining enterprises, and comprehensively improved all work. This is the main way for us to implement the Party's General Line. Because large-area high yield requires "high yield in all aspects, high yield every month, and continuous rise," to achieve this requirement, in the guiding ideology and leadership methods of enterprise management, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, make overall plans, comprehensively arrange, grasp both ends, drive the middle, grasp both typical examples and generalities, which changes the past ideological method of relying on a few people, only caring about typical examples, and neglecting generalities. The large-area high-yield red flag is a collective honor. To obtain it, it is impossible to achieve it by achieving partial or temporary results. It is necessary to continuously overcome the weak links in production with the spirit of continuous revolution, comprehensively improve all aspects of work, and through the conscious efforts of the masses, make the backward quickly catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced, the advanced surface becomes wider and wider, and the backward surface becomes less and less, achieving common improvement and comprehensive leap forward.

The development of the red flag emulation campaign for large-area high yield has enabled us to better implement the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements. Because the large-area high-yield red flag competition has a clear banner and a concentrated goal, it constantly organizes mass competitions and evaluations, and regularly conducts commendations and rewards based on the principle of combining political commendation with necessary material rewards. These continuously encourage the morale of the masses, making the movement rise one wave after another and push it from one climax to another. Therefore, a large number of new people and new things have continuously emerged, creating a new situation of "learning, comparing, catching up, helping," chasing each other, and changing with each passing day, making the movement deepen step by step and implement it throughout. At the same time, the forms of competition are also diverse, lively, and have a style that is popular with the masses, such as "paired competitions," "one-dragon competitions," and so on. Through these competition forms, all departments, all aspects, all links, and all individuals are mobilized and organized without exception, making the movement both a vigorous momentum and solid content, achieving breadth, depth, specificity, and persistence. Because we have carried out the red flag emulation campaign for large-area high yield, a good situation of model soldiers forming columns and red flags forming forests has emerged, comprehensively improving various tasks of the coal industry.

Three, Vigorously Carry out Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution
To continuously and rapidly develop the coal industry, it is necessary to fully carry forward the spirit of hard work and solid work, but also to carry forward the spirit of clever work. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and masses is the fundamental driving force for the high-speed development of the coal industry. Without enthusiasm, it is equivalent to losing the soul. After the enthusiasm of the workers and masses is mobilized, if this enthusiasm is not guided to technical innovation and technical revolution, which is of decisive significance for the development of production, it is impossible to make the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and masses consolidated and lasting, and the production and construction cause cannot be developed continuously and at a high speed. This is the inevitable law of the development of objective things. In 1959, precisely because we grasped this law, a magnificent and colorful mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution was rapidly and comprehensively launched on the coal industry front. From production and construction, geological exploration departments to machinery manufacturing, design, and scientific research departments, from coal mining, tunneling, and transportation to construction and installation, and the workers and masses in all aspects were involved in this movement, further breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and creating millions of relatively comprehensive and systematic advanced experiences with a unique style of daring to think and daring to do. Among them, 180 major projects were summarized and identified. The widespread promotion of these advanced experiences has become a powerful weapon for the continuous, large-area, high-yield, and comprehensive improvement of various tasks in the coal industry, and has made the science and technology of the coal industry enter a new period of prosperity.

In recent years, the scientific research work of the coal industry, like the production and construction work, under the shining of the General Line, under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Coal Industry and local Party committees, and with the strong support of various production units and manufacturing departments, the scientific research team has continued to grow, and the scientific research work has made remarkable achievements. Since 1956, research and experiments have been conducted on the world's most advanced underground hydraulic coal mining technology, breaking through technical barriers, mastering hydraulic coal mining technology, and hydraulic coal mining has yielded fruitful results in coal mines across the country, thus making our country's coal mining technology enter a new era and stride into the world's advanced field. In steep inclined medium-thick coal seams and thick coal seams, research and experiments have been carried out on the shield support coal mining method, which has achieved good results of high efficiency, low cost, less timber consumption, and work safety, and its application range has been expanded and promoted in inclined coal seams. In coal preparation, significant achievements have also been made in the research on the use of heavy medium coal preparation methods. This coal preparation method has ten advantages, such as high efficiency, low investment, simple equipment structure, convenient operation, and short construction period, which plays an important role in rapidly developing coal preparation undertakings and supplying the leaping development of the steel industry with the need for coking coal. Significant achievements have also been made in the extraction of gas, and gas, which endangers our safe production, has begun to be tamed and applied to industry for the benefit of mankind. In mine construction, the pipe column method of well sinking has been successfully tested, which has a unique Chinese style and has found a new way for the construction of thick quicksand layers. In addition, good results have also been achieved in mine machinery manufacturing, mine pressure, mechanization and automation, rock crushing, coalfield geological exploration, comprehensive utilization of coal, and underground gasification. Because the scientific research work of coal is closely combined with the needs of production and construction, the results of scientific research can be quickly promoted and applied in production and construction, which has played a significant role in the Great Leap Forward of production and construction.

Technical Revolution Poses a Large Number of New Problems for Scientific Research
Since the beginning of the new year in 1960, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is booming, and everywhere presents a scene of "technical revolution is full of spring, and all kinds of flowers are vying for beauty." Coal loading machines, combined coal loading and material transporting machines, rock electric drills, various new types of supports, timberless mines, three-no working faces (no people, no electricity, no chute) for steep inclined coal seams, and gas-lift centrifugal flotation machines and other technical achievements of great significance continue to emerge, presenting a good situation of a good start and all-round success.

Now, the three-izations (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulization, semi-hydraulization) centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization and the five-revolution (reform of mining methods, liberation of heavy labor, simplification of production processes, acceleration of the speed of four operations - mining, tunneling, drilling, reduction or elimination of timber use) movement centered on reforming mining methods are being widely and deeply carried out in the national coal industry system with the momentum of overwhelming mountains and overturning seas, the coal science research institutions should not only actively participate in the movement, closely combine with the innovative creations of the broad masses, and make contributions to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, but more importantly, they should concentrate their efforts and quickly set off a climax of marching toward cutting-edge technology and fiercely attacking high, precise, and advanced technologies in order to change the technical face of our country's coal industry and open up ways for the continuous Great Leap Forward of the coal industry.

This year, coal science research institutions will cooperate closely with production and construction units to make a major march toward high, precise, and advanced technologies: to realize the three-no working faces (no people, no chute, no timber) under various production conditions; timberless mines, so that timber consumption is reduced by more than 30% compared with 1959; to eliminate pneumatic tools and realize power unification; to complete the industrial utilization of underground gasification; to realize the automation of hydraulic mining mines and the automation of the main production processes of dry mining mines; and to create new records in the advancing speed of the recovery working face, the output of the working face, rock roadways, coal roadways, semi-coal and semi-rock roadways, inclined shafts, and vertical shafts. It can be imagined that after several years of efforts, in addition to achieving a continuous Great Leap Forward in output, the technical face of the coal industry will also be completely changed.

At that time, the heavy labor on all fronts of the coal industry will be completely liberated, and the labor at that time will be entirely possible, as the worker comrades praised hydraulic mining, "Heavy work becomes light work, and labor becomes entertainment." The speed of recovery, tunneling, and drilling will become faster and faster. The average monthly progress of all recovery working faces in the country will double, triple, or even more on the basis of 49 meters in 1959. The average monthly output of all recovery working faces in the country will no longer be the current 7,000 tons, but 20,000 to 30,000 tons, 40,000 to 50,000 tons, or even more growth. A mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons only needs one recovery working face. The average monthly progress of vertical shaft shafts will no longer be the current tens of meters, but hundreds of meters. The average monthly efficiency of a drilling machine will no longer be the current two hundred meters, but one thousand meters or two thousand meters.

At that time, the timber consumption of coal mining enterprises will become less and less. After reforming coal mining methods, widely using timber substitutes, vigorously saving timber and comprehensively utilizing it, we may be able to make the timber consumption of the coal industry in 1960 the lowest in history. No matter how much the future coal output increases to 800 million, 1 billion, or even billions of tons, we may no longer need to increase timber.

Strive to Create a Set of New Coal Mining Technologies Suitable for the Characteristics of Our Country's Coal Mines
After several major revolutions in coal mining methods, after a few years, we will definitely be able to create a complete set of coal mining technology experience that not only concentrates on all the advanced technologies in the world, but also suits the specific conditions of our country's coal mines, has a unique style, and is the most advanced, most reasonable, and most complete. The process, procedures, and types of work in coal mine production and construction will become more and more simplified. Realize the combination of wind and electricity, and the unification of power; realize the combination of mining and tunneling, and the combination of up and down mountain roadways; realize a one-dragon transportation above and below the well. At that time, our labor productivity will continue to increase, and our raw coal unit cost and investment in building tons of coal will also be the lowest in the world. With the rapid development of various advanced technologies such as hydraulic mining, remote control, automatic control, and underground gasification, the ideal of turning underground operations into ground operations for some coal mines will gradually become a reality. At that time, the coal miners only need to press a button in the spacious central control room on the ground.

In order to realize the above-mentioned ambitious goals as soon as possible, we are determined to strengthen political and ideological work under the leadership of the Party, vigorously promote the spirit of cooperation; vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, and set off a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution; carry out a ten-thousand-person model selection competition, promote advanced experience in a complete, rapid, and comprehensive manner; reform enterprise management work to promote the Great Leap Forward in production and construction; vigorously run education to cultivate and strengthen the red and expert team of coal mine workers; vigorously develop non-staple food production, improve life, and enhance the physical fitness of workers.

Representatives! The glorious and bright prospects of the coal industry are no longer a distant future thing. In this bright spring of the 1960s, we have set ambitious goals. As long as we hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the red flag of the General Line, oppose right-leaning with the spirit of continuous revolution, and conduct irreconcilable struggles with bourgeois ideology, give full play to revolutionary enthusiasm, and with the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," vigorously carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and fiercely attack high, precise, and advanced technologies, we will definitely be able to turn ideals into reality in three, five years, or even a shorter period of time, and we will definitely be able to make our country's coal industry reach the peak of the world's advanced level in terms of output, science and technology, and various technical and economic indicators, and we will definitely be able to create a set of the most advanced science and technology that is in line with our country's situation, adapts to the high-speed development of our country's coal industry, and has a unique style. We are full of confidence in victory, and we will definitely achieve glorious victory! (Attached picture)

### 采煤方法大革命的日子来到了

    采煤方法大革命的日子来到了
    我们立下了雄心大志：在几年之内，将要创造出来一套切合我国煤矿特点的，具有独特风格的，最先进，最合理，最完整的采煤科学技术。
    王德滋代表谈煤炭科学研究工作各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理的1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告、谭震林副总理的关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而斗争的报告。
    现在我就煤炭工业及其科学技术问题发表一些意见。
    1959年全国人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻，坚持了党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社，把我国社会主义建设推向了一个新的阶段，使我国的工业、农业、交通运输、文化教育等各个方面都在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了更好、更全面的大跃进，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划规定的主要指标。这一伟大成就，有力地粉碎了帝国主义和国内外敌对势力的造谣诬蔑，极大地鼓舞和支援了全世界人民的反帝斗争。
    煤炭工业和全国的形势一样，1959年实现了既按比例、又高速度地大跃进。继1958年我国煤炭产量超过英国之后，1959年又有了很大的增长，全年生产原煤三亿四千七百八十万吨，比1958年增长了28.8％。不仅煤炭产量实现了大跃进，煤炭科学技术也取得了很大的成就，获得了高速度的发展。
    煤炭工业科学研究取得成就的几点体会
    煤炭工业及其科学技术，所以能取得上述伟大成就，除了依靠党的绝对领导外，还有以下几点经验：
    一，坚持政治挂帅
    坚持政治挂帅是一切革命事业和建设事业取得胜利的根本保证。几年以来，在煤炭工业战线上，展现了两种思想、两条路线的斗争：一条是坚持政治挂帅，以不断革命的精神和大搞群众运动的方法，来管理煤矿企业；另一条是坚持“技术业务挂帅”，依靠少数人和规章制度，四平八稳、冷冷清清的管理煤矿企业。千百万的事实证明：前一条是马克思、列宁主义的观点、方法，是多快好省高速度发展煤炭工业的正确路线；后一条是非无产阶级的观点、方法，是少慢差费低速度发展煤炭工业的错误路线。两年多以来，在这两条路线的斗争过程中，我们坚持了前一条正确的路线，不断地批判了后一条错误的路线，从理论上和实际工作中解决了有关高速度发展煤炭工业的生产与需要问题、积极平衡问题、正常生产与突击的关系问题、生产与基本建设的关系问题。由于我们坚持了政治挂帅、认真地解决了上述若干重大问题，就使得煤炭工业的面貌瞬息万变、气象万千。
    二，开展大面积高产红旗竞赛运动
    1959年，在煤炭工业战线上开展的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动，有效地调动了各方面的积极因素，正确处理了煤矿企业中先进与落后的矛盾，全面提高了一切工作。这是我们贯彻执行党的总路线的主要途径。因为大面积高产是要求“面面高产，月月高产，持续上升”，实现这一要求，在企业管理的指导思想和领导方法上，就必须全面发动群众，统筹兼顾，全面安排，抓紧两头，带动中间，既抓典型，又抓一般，这就改变了过去那种依靠少数人，只顾典型，忽视一般的思想方法。大面积高产红旗是一种集体的荣誉，要获得它，决不是取得局部的、临时的成绩所能办到的，必须以不断革命的精神，不断克服生产中所出现的薄弱环节，全面提高各方面的工作，通过群众的自觉努力，使落后的迅速赶上先进，先进的更加先进，先进面愈来愈广，落后面愈来愈少，做到了共同提高，全面跃进。
    大面积高产红旗竞赛运动的开展，使我们更好地贯彻执行了党的集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针。因为大面积高产红旗竞赛，旗帜鲜明，目标集中，而且不断地组织了群众性的竞赛评比，并本着以政治表扬为主与必要的物质奖励相结合的原则，定期地进行了表扬和奖励，通过这些不断地鼓舞了群众的斗志，使运动一浪高一浪，由一个高潮推向另一个高潮。因此，不断出现了大量的新人新事，造成了“学、比、赶、帮”、你追我赶、日新月异的新形势，使运动步步深入，贯彻始终。同时竞赛的形式又百花齐放，生动活泼，具有群众喜闻乐见的风格。如“对口赛”、“一条龙赛”等等。通过这些竞赛形式，就把各个部门、各个方面、各个环节、各个人都毫无例外地动员组织起来了，使运动既有轰轰烈烈的声势，又有扎扎实实的内容，作到了广泛、深入、具体、持久。由于我们开展了大面积高产红旗竞赛运动，出现了标兵成列、红旗成林的大好局面，全面提高了煤炭工业的各种工作。
    三，大闹技术革新和技术革命
    要持续高速度地发展煤炭工业，就必须既要充分发扬苦干和实干的精神，又要发扬巧干的精神。职工群众的革命干劲是高速度发展煤炭工业的根本动力，没有了干劲，就等于失去了灵魂。当职工群众的干劲发动起来以后，若不把这种干劲引导到对于发展生产具有决定意义的技术革新和技术革命方面去，就不可能使职工群众的革命干劲巩固持久，生产建设事业就不可能持续高速度地发展。这是客观事物发展的必然规律。1959年，正因为我们掌握了这一规律，一个波澜壮阔、丰富多采的技术革新和技术革命运动，迅速在煤炭工业战线上全面展开，从生产建设、地质勘探部门到机械制造、设计、科学研究部门，从采煤、掘进、运输到建筑安装等环节，以及各个方面的职工群众，都卷入了这一运动，更进一步破除了迷信，解放了思想，以敢想、敢干的独特风格，创造出千百万比较全面系统的，而且具有普遍意义和现实意义的先进经验。其中，经过总结鉴定的重大项目达到一百八十项。这些先进经验的普遍推广，就成为煤炭工业持续大面积高产、全面提高各种工作的有力武器，并使煤炭工业的科学技术进入了一个繁荣昌盛的新时期。
    几年来，煤炭工业的科学研究工作，同生产建设工作一样，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在煤炭工业部和各地党委的正确领导下，以及各生产单位、制造部门大力支持下，科学研究队伍不断壮大，科学研究工作取得了显著的成绩。从1956年开始，对世界上最先进的地下水力采煤技术进行了研究和试验，突破了技术关，掌握了水力采煤技术，水力采煤在全国煤矿中结出了丰硕的果实，从而使我国采煤技术进入了一个新的时期，跨进了世界先进的领域。在急倾斜中厚煤层和厚煤层中，进行了掩护支架采煤法的研究试验，取得了效率高、成本低、坑木消耗少、工作安全的良好效果，并扩大了它的应用范围，在倾斜煤层中得到了推广应用。在选煤方面，对利用重介质选煤方法的研究也取得了显著的成绩，这种选煤方法具有效率高、投资少、设备结构简单、操作方便、建设工期短等十大优点，为迅速发展选煤事业，供应钢铁工业飞跃发展对精煤的需要，起着重要的作用。在抽放瓦斯方面，也作出了显著的成绩，开始把危害我们安全生产的瓦斯驯服地运用到工业上，为人类造福。在矿井建设方面，试验成功了管柱法凿井，它具有中国的独特风格，为通过厚流砂层的施工找到了新的途径。此外，在矿山机械制造方面、矿山压力方面、机械化自动化方面、岩石破碎方面、煤田地质勘探方面、煤炭综合利用方面、地下气化方面，也都取得了良好的成绩。由于煤炭科学研究工作是紧密地结合生产建设需要进行的，因此科学研究的成果就能够迅速地在生产建设中推广和应用，对生产建设的大跃进起了显著的作用。
    技术革命给科学研究提出大量新问题
    1960年新春以来，以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动正在蓬勃地开展着，到处呈现出一片“技术革命春满园，万紫千红齐争艳”的景象。攉煤机、攉煤运料联合机、岩石电钻、各种新型支架、无坑木矿、急倾斜煤层无人无电溜子无坑木的三无工作面、气升式离心浮选机等有重大意义的技术成就不断涌现，呈现了开门红、面面红的大好形势。
    现在，以机械化、半机械化为中心的三化（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，水力化、半水力化）和以改革采掘方法为中心的五革命（改革采掘方法，解放笨重劳动，简化生产过程，加快四采、掘进、钻探速度，少用或不用坑木）运动，正以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势在全国煤炭工业系统中广泛深入地开展着，煤炭科学研究机关除了应该积极投入运动，和广大群众的革新创造紧密地结合起来，在技术革新和技术革命运动中作出贡献外，更重要的是应该集中力量，迅速掀起一个向尖端技术进军，猛攻高、精、尖的热潮，以改变我国煤炭工业的技术面貌，为煤炭工业持续大跃进开辟途径。
    今年，煤炭科学研究机关将和生产建设单位密切合作，向高、精、尖大进军：实现各种生产条件的无人、无溜子、无坑木的三无工作面；无坑木矿，使坑木消耗比1959年降低30％以上；取消风动工具，实现动力一元化；完成地下气化的工业利用；实现水采矿井的自动化及旱采矿井主要生产过程的自动化；在回采工作面推进速度、工作面产量、岩石平巷、煤巷、半煤半岩巷、斜井、竖井等方面创造新的纪录。可以设想，经过几年的努力，我们除了在产量上实现连续大跃进以外，煤炭工业的技术面貌，也定将彻底改观。
    在那个时候，煤炭工业各个战线上的笨重劳动将彻底解放，那时的劳动完全有可能像工人同志们赞扬水力采煤时所说的那样：“重活变轻活，劳动变娱乐”。回采、掘进、钻探速度越来越快。全国全部回采工作面的平均月进度，将在1959年四十九米的基础上翻一番，翻两番，甚至更多。全国全部回采工作面的平均月产量，将不再是现在的七千吨，而是两、三万吨，四、五万吨，甚至有更大的增长。一个年产六十万吨的矿井，只要一个回采工作面就够了。竖井井筒的平均月进度也不再是现在的几十米，而是几百米。在借钻机的平均台月效率也不再是现在的两百多米，而是一千米或两千米。
    到那个时候，煤矿企业的坑木消耗量将越来越少。经过改革采煤方法，广泛采用坑木代用品，大搞坑木节约和综合利用，我们有可能使1960年煤炭工业的坑木消耗是历史上最低的，今后的煤炭产量无论增长到八亿、十亿，甚至几十亿吨，我们有可能再也不需要增加坑木。
    为创造一套适合我国煤矿特点的采煤新技术而努力
    在采煤方法上经过几次大的革命，在几年之后，我们将一定能够创造出一整套既集中了世界上一切先进技术，又切合我国煤矿具体条件的具有独创风格的，最先进、最合理、最完整的采煤技术经验。煤矿生产建设的工艺过程、工序、工种将越来越简化。实现风电合一，动力单一化；实现采掘合一，上下山大巷合一；实现井上下运输一条龙。那时我们的劳动生产率将不断增长，我们的原煤单位成本和建井吨煤投资也将是世界上最低的。随着水力采煤、远方操纵、自动控制、地下气化等各项先进技术的迅速发展，变部分煤矿的地下作业为地面作业的理想也将逐步成为现实。那时的煤矿工人，只要在地面宽敞的中央控制室中按按电钮就可以了。
    为了尽快尽早地实现上述的雄心大志，我们决心在党的领导下，加强政治思想工作，大兴协作之风；大搞机械化、半机械化，掀起技术革新和技术革命的新高潮；开展千万人次的标兵选拔赛，成套、快速、全面地推广先进经验；改革企业管理工作，促进生产建设大跃进；大办教育，培养、壮大煤矿职工的红专队伍；大搞副食品生产，改善生活，增强职工体质。
    代表们！煤炭工业光辉灿烂的前景，已经不是遥远将来的事情了。在这六十年代第一个明媚的春天，我们立下雄心大志，只要我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗、总路线的红旗，以不断革命的精神反对右倾，和资产阶级思想进行不调和的斗争，鼓足革命干劲，以“要高山低头，河水让路”的英雄气概，大闹技术革新和技术革命运动，猛攻高、精、尖，我们就一定能够在三、五年或更短一些的时间内，把理想变成现实，一定能够使我国煤炭工业在产量、科学技术和各项技术经济指标方面，登上世界先进水平的高峰，一定能够创造出一套符合我国情况、适应我国煤炭工业高速度发展、具有独特风格的最先进的科学技术。我们充满胜利的信心，也一定能获得光辉的胜利！（附图片）
