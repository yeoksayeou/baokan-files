Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 22nd: The Pioneer People's Commune, composed mainly of street residents and employees' families in Wuhan, has developed community-run industries through makeshift methods. In just over a year, this residential area has seen the emergence of ninety-one factories. The total output value of community-run industries has also increased year by year. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the commune increased nearly tenfold compared to 1958, and in the first quarter of this year, it increased by 5.2 times compared to the same period last year. The collective welfare undertakings run by the commune have also greatly developed, enabling nearly ten thousand able-bodied housewives and employees' families in the commune to break away from household chores and participate in production and work.

　　In the fourth quarter of 1958, encouraged by the Great Leap Forward and under the leadership of Party organizations, residents of this area vigorously launched street industries, with thousands of idle laborers participating in production and work. After residents participated in production, they urgently demanded the establishment of various collective welfare undertakings. At the same time, with the continued development of production and construction, more idle laborers participated in production and work. Under this new situation, the local Party organization mobilized the masses, and after full deliberation, officially established the Pioneer People's Commune in November.

　　After the establishment of the Pioneer People's Commune, it organized the masses to establish many small factories in a simple and crude manner, based on the commune's characteristics of having few strong laborers and lacking equipment and factory buildings. These factories processed small parts for large factories or manufactured simple tools, or used waste materials and leftover bits from large factories to produce small commodities such as hairpins, clips, gloves, pencil cases, pot shovels, and mats. Because these factories had diverse products, flexible production, and simple equipment, they developed rapidly, and various factories sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, creating a moving scene of "a hundred flowers blooming with the spring breeze overnight." After rectification and mergers, by the end of last year, the commune had forty-three factories, each with about fifty to one hundred and fifty people. These factories included more than ten industries such as machinery, rubber, wood, bamboo, textiles, sewing, and food. The number of employees reached 2,876, and the total industrial output value increased nearly tenfold compared to 1958. The main products increased from more than ten types before the commune's establishment to more than ninety types. In the first quarter of this year, the number of community-run factories increased to ninety-one, the number of employees increased to 3,846, and the total output value increased sharply by 5.2 times compared to the same period last year. Among the new products added, there were seventeen major types alone.

　　When developing community-run industries, the Pioneer Commune adhered to the policy of moving from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, gradual reform, and gradual improvement. At the beginning, the equipment of community-run factories was generally very simple, relying almost entirely on manual operation, and the technical force was very weak. Now, the personnel in the vast majority of the commune's factories have increased several times to more than ten times compared to the original, and the equipment has also been greatly improved. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in each factory has been greatly improved, and sixteen automated and semi-automated production lines and fifty-nine single-machine automatic units have been realized, enabling a large number of workers to break away from heavy manual labor. Production efficiency has increased several times, dozens of times, and in the most cases, up to five hundred times. According to statistics for the first quarter of this year, among the one hundred and fifty major economic indicators of various community-run factories, seventy have reached or approached the national advanced level; and the quality of nearly ten kinds of products has reached the national advanced level.

　　In the past year and more, the community-run industries of the Pioneer People's Commune have played a significant role in assisting large factories, supporting agriculture, and serving the people's lives. Seven factories in the commune, such as the Dazhi Machinery Factory, the Daqiao Machinery Factory, and the Dazhi Rubber Factory, directly serve large industries such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and Wuhan Boiler Plant. For example, the Daqiao Machinery Factory processes screws for Wuhan Iron and Steel and produces flatbed carts and trailers for the transportation department; the centrifugal rubber wheels and rubber tires produced by the Dazhi Rubber Factory meet the needs of basic construction departments, and some are also supplied to other large cities in China. This year, the Dazhi Bamboo Ware Factory produced parts for four hundred rice transplanters and more than one hundred wooden screws to support the countryside; the Daqiao Machinery Factory also regularly repairs and assembles diesel engines and other power machinery and agricultural machinery for the countryside.

　　While developing production, the commune has also vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings, service undertakings, and cultural undertakings, with canteens as the center. Now the commune runs thirty-two public canteens; forty-five nurseries and kindergartens, including six "one-stop" childcare organizations (with infant rooms, nurseries, kindergartens, and primary school tutoring classes); ten service stations providing various services for production and life and handling various sales businesses; and two hundred and two branch stations. It has also established collective welfare undertakings such as hospitals, cultural centers, theaters, health stations, cultural stations, homes for the elderly, and a primary school.

　　Due to the development of production, the living standards of the commune members have also greatly improved. In 1959, the average annual wage of commune members participating in industrial production was more than 30 yuan, which was significantly higher than before joining the commune. After the vast number of housewives participated in production, not only did their political awareness significantly improve, but also their cultural and technical level improved greatly. Women who participated in production when the commune was established generally have the level of a third-grade worker now, and many women have also served as factory directors of community-run factories.

    由小到大　由土到洋　逐步改革　逐步提高
    先锋公社因陋就简发展工业
    据新华社武汉22日电　武汉以街道居民和职工家属为主组成的先锋人民公社，因陋就简发展社办工业，使这个居民区里在一年多中就出现了九十一座工厂。社办工业的生产总值也逐年提高，1959年全社工业总产值比1958年增长近十倍，今年第一季度又比去年同期增加五点二倍。公社举办的集体福利事业也有很大发展，使全社有近万名有劳动力的家庭妇女和职工家属摆脱了家务牵累，参加了生产和工作。
    1958年第四季度，这个地区的居民在大跃进形势的鼓舞和党组织的领导下，大办街道工业，有数以千计的闲散劳动力参加了生产和工作。居民参加生产以后，迫切要求举办各种集体福利事业。同时，随着生产建设事业的继续发展，又有更多的闲散的劳动力参加了生产和工作。在这种新形势下，当地党组织就发动群众，经过充分酝酿，在11月份正式成立了先锋人民公社。
    先锋人民公社成立以后，就根据公社强劳动力少和缺乏设备、厂房等情况，组织群众因陋就简地举办了许多小型工厂，为大工厂加工小型部件或承制简单机具，或者利用大工厂的废料、边料生产别针、发夹、手套、文具盒、锅铲和席子等小商品。由于这些工厂产品多样，生产灵便，设备简单，因之发展得很快，各种工厂如雨后春笋一般地建立起来，出现了“一夜春风百花开”的动人局面。以后经过整顿、合并，到去年年底止，公社共有四十三个分别拥有五十人到一百五十人左右的工厂；其中包括机械、橡胶、木材、竹器、纺织、缝纫、食品等十多种工业，职工人数共达二千八百七十六人，工业总产值较1958年增长近十倍，主要产品由公社建立前的十几种增加到九十多种。今年第一季度，社办工厂又增加到九十一个，职工人数增加到三千八百四十六人，生产总值较去年同季又猛增五点二倍；增加的新产品中仅主要的就有十七种。
    先锋公社在发展社办工业的时候，坚持了由小到大、由土到洋、逐步改革，逐步提高的方针。开始时，社办工厂设备一般都很简陋，几乎全靠手工操作，技术力量十分薄弱。现在，全社绝大多数工厂的人员都较原来增加了几倍到十几倍，设备也有了很大改善，各厂机械化、半机械化的程度已经大大提高，并实现了自动化、半自动化生产流水线十六条，单机自动机台五十九台，使大批工人摆脱了笨重的手工劳动，生产效率提高几倍、几十倍，最多的提高达五百倍。据今年第一季度统计，各社办工厂的一百五十个主要经济指标中，已有七十个赶上或接近全国先进水平；近十种产品质量达到全国先进水平。
    一年多来，先锋人民公社的社办工业在作为大厂的助手、支援农业和为人民生活服务方面，都发挥了很大作用。全社有大智机械厂、大桥机械厂、大智橡胶厂等七个工厂直接为武汉钢铁厂、重型机床厂、武汉锅炉厂等大工业服务。如大桥机械厂为武钢加工螺丝、为交通运输部门生产板车、拖斗车；大智橡胶厂生产的离心胶轮、胶轮等，供应了基本建设部门的需要，有的还供应了国内其他大城市的需要。大智篾器厂今年生产了四百台插秧机的零件和一百多罗木螺丝支援农村；大桥机械厂也经常为农村修配柴油机等动力机械和农业机械。
    在发展生产的同时，公社还以食堂为中心，大力发展了集体福利事业、服务事业和文化事业。现在公社举办的公共食堂有三十二个；托儿所、幼儿园四十五个，其中包括“一条龙”式的托儿组织六个（内设婴儿室、托儿所、幼儿园、小学辅导班）；各种为生产、生活服务和代办各种销售业务的服务总站十个；分站达二百零二个；还建立了医院、文化馆、剧场、卫生站、文化站、敬老院等集体福利事业和一所小学。
    由于生产的发展，社员群众的生活水平也大大提高，1959年参加工业生产的社员全年平均工资在三十元以上，比入社前有显著增加。广大家庭妇女参加生产以后，不仅政治觉悟显著提高，而且文化、技术水平也有很大提高。在公社建立时参加生产的妇女，现在一般都有三级工的水平，许多妇女还担任了社办工厂的厂长。（附图片）
