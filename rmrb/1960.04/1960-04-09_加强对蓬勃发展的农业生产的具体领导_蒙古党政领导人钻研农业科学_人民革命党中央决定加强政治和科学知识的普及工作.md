    Strengthen Specific Leadership Over Flourishing Agricultural Production
    Mongolian Party and Government Leaders Delve into Agricultural Science
    People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee Decides to Strengthen the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge
    (This dispatch) According to the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper, in order to strengthen specific leadership over the booming agricultural production, Mongolian party and government leaders recently invited agricultural experts to lecture on basic knowledge of agricultural science.
    These lectures were held according to the decision of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party. Participants included members of the Politburo of the Central Committee, Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers, and heads of various ministries and commissions of the Party and government. The main topics included: the natural geographic, climatic and soil conditions for developing agricultural production in Mongolia, land reclamation, soil improvement, grain and vegetable sowing issues, field management and harvesting, pests and diseases, agricultural mechanization, etc. The lectures totaled more than thirty hours and have recently concluded.
    (This dispatch) The Mongolian "Truth" newspaper reported on the 8th that the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party recently made a decision requiring the strengthening of political and scientific knowledge popularization work among the working people.
    The decision stated that the people's political and labor enthusiasm has reached a new high, and their desire to master basic scientific knowledge is also becoming increasingly urgent. In order to realize the industrialization and electrification of the country, to settle herdsmen, and to create a civilized life, carrying out this popularization work is more necessary now than at any time before.
    The decision pointed out that the Mongolian Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge should organize scholars, engineers, etc., to publicize Marxism-Leninism, dialectical materialism, the Party's policies, and scientific knowledge to the broad masses. The association should educate and promote intellectuals to serve the people loyally, and encourage them to immerse themselves in life and production practice.
    The Central Committee of the Party also decided to convene the first representative congress of the Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge in May this year to discuss the current tasks of the association.
    (This dispatch) The national culture and art of the Mongolian people have achieved remarkable achievements.
    At present, there are six theaters, two song and dance ensembles, six cinemas, more than four hundred fixed and mobile projection teams, seventeen cultural palaces, more than fifty clubs, and more than four hundred "red corners" (cultural centers). The country also has twenty fine arts institutions, the Republic Film Studio, the National Circus, seventeen local academic research institutions, and forty local libraries. Radio has become an indispensable part of the lives of the working people. All provinces, state farms, agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives, and residential areas throughout the country are equipped with radios. The ties between cultural institutions and the working masses are also becoming increasingly close, playing an important role in conducting socialist education for the masses, improving the political and labor enthusiasm of the working people, and completing the tasks of developing industry, agriculture, science, and culture.
    The Party and the government attach great importance to the training of national art cadres. In order to improve the cultural level and professional skills of art workers, a night university was established in 1949, and an advanced training class was attached to the Mongolian National University in 1956. In order to fully ensure that the theater and film troupes have talented actors, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided in 1959 to open an actor training class at the Mongolian National Teachers College.
    The Three-Year Plan for the Development of National Economy and Culture of the Mongolian People's Republic stipulates that in 1960 there will be seventy clubs, five hundred and ten "red corners," and three hundred and fifty mobile film projection teams.

    决定说，人民的政治和劳动积极性有了新的高涨，他们要求掌握科学基础知识的愿望也日益迫切。为了实现国家工业化、电气化，使牧民定居下来和创造文明生活，开展这种普及工作，现在比以前任何时期都更加需要。
    决定指出，蒙古政治与科学知识普及协会应该组织学者、工程师等向广大人民宣传马克思列宁主义思想、辩证唯物主义、党的政策和科学知识。协会要教育和推动知识分子忠诚地为人民服务，使他们深入生活和生产实践。
