Under the care and strong support of the Party, Dian Opera has been reborn and has regained its vitality. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the political ideology of the actors has greatly improved, and they have also achieved new gains in art. Whether it is traditional opera or modern opera, a scene of blooming flowers is presented.

Dian Opera, before liberation, suffered the cruel devastation of the reactionaries and was almost on the verge of extinction. After liberation, under the care and strong support of the Party, it regained its vitality and grew again, from three or four disorganized troupes to thirty-four Dian Opera troupes. There are also many being prepared that are not included in this number. New forces are growing rapidly, and repertoires are constantly being explored and innovated. This is the new life that the Party has brought to Dian Opera. When mentioned, all the Dian Opera artists in the province have endless gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao in their hearts.

Especially since the rectification campaign and anti-Rightist struggle, there has been great progress in political and artistic thought. Dian Opera artists have become closer to the Party in terms of ideological feelings. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country, Dian Opera has also seen a vigorous leap forward, and unprecedented achievements have been made in all aspects, which makes us deeply realize that without the Party, there would be no us, let alone the development and future of the cause. Only by listening to the Party's words and following the Party forever is the only correct path. Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party can the Dian Opera cause be truly developed and improved.

The achievements of Dian Opera in the past ten years are, first of all, a great improvement in political thought. Under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party, the vast number of artists have clarified that literature and art must serve the proletariat and serve production. Every troupe does its best to go to the mountains and countryside, delivering operas to the doorsteps. Wherever there are new people and new things, they sing and praise them without any conditions. In the wind and snow, in the open air, in front of a candlelight, in the middle of the night, in the desolate mountains and grass, they perform seriously. It is generally achieved to actively respond to various political movements, participate in labor training, vigorously carry out political propaganda, go deep into life and combine with workers and peasants, and transform their thinking. The majority of young people have established a firm sense of enterprise, dare to think and dare to do, actively learn traditions, and inherit the Dian Opera cause. The vast number of old artists actively lean towards the Party, and many artists strive to join the Party and the League. Many have joined the Party and League organizations, thereby greatly strengthening the Dian Opera team politically.

Due to the political leap forward of artists throughout the province, new artistic gains have been brought about. Last year, focusing on the National Day celebration, the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" and "walking on two legs" – that is, developing traditions and reflecting reality – was universally implemented. Especially in the creation of modern operas, it was truly an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of Dian Opera. Various troupes launched mass creation activities. For example, the Qujing Special District Troupe created more than 100 operas in half a year around the National Day celebration, and the Provincial Dian Opera Troupe created 45 operas in two months. Moreover, some of them have been put on the stage. Even blind old artists, 14-year-old young actors, and stage staff have invested in creation, expanded the creation team, enriched the repertoire, and truly cooperated with politics. In the reorganization of traditional operas, excellent operas such as "The Women Generals of the Yang Family", "Drum Rolling Liu Feng", and "Burning Bowang Slope" have been produced and are loved by the masses. There has also been a big step forward in directing, arranging, and performing. The "Two Women Red Army" performed by the Provincial Dian Opera Troupe opened an on-site conference on directing and performing modern operas throughout the province, laying a certain foundation for performing modern operas in the future. What is even more gratifying is that Dian Opera was put on the screen for the first time in its history. The film "Borrowing a Relative Marriage" was welcomed by the people when it was screened in Yunnan, which further encouraged the artists' enthusiasm. Before the National Day celebration, a selection of Dian Opera scripts from the past ten years and two collections of Dian Opera music were published, which further promoted the development of Dian Opera. In the work of cultivating the next generation, various troupes have grasped it very tightly, adopting the method of troupe replacing class, striving to quickly change the phenomenon of generational gaps left over from the past destruction by the reactionaries. At present, two-thirds of the members of each troupe are young people. Of course, this is far from meeting the needs of society, and we must catch up better and faster.

In short, since the Great Leap Forward, the Dian Opera cause has achieved unprecedented harvest under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the artists. All this should be attributed to the Party and the general line. All this is the victory of Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art. We thank the Party and thank Chairman Mao.

1960 is a year of high-speed leap forward in our country. We hold high the red flag of Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art, and under the leadership of the Party, we universally launch a study movement of Chairman Mao's thought, arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thought, and use it as a guide for all our work. We will continue to go to the mountains and countryside, go deep into life, combine with workers and peasants to transform our thinking, and establish a proletarian world view, so that we can truly become the Party's loyal literary and artistic fighters and make Dian Opera a powerful propaganda team of the Party.

In art, we must continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new," constantly innovate and create, strive for the upper reaches, actively learn from other fraternal opera types across the country, strive to catch up with the advanced national level, and produce cutting-edge operas to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Party. We will also actively cultivate new forces, strengthen the Dian Opera team, and do everything possible to improve the quality of art, striving to make Dian Opera quickly become a well-deserved Yunnan camellia within three years, so that this camellia, like the fraternal opera types across the country, can bloom colorfully and contribute its strength to the years of building socialism and advancing to communism. At present, although there are still difficulties such as insufficient cadre strength, under the leadership of the Party, we have the confidence and determination to overcome them, so as to realize our wishes.

    大跃进以来滇剧事业的发展
    周惠侬委员的发言
    在党的关怀和大力扶持下，滇剧获得了新生，恢复了元气。特别是大跃进以来，演员的政治思想大大提高，艺术上也获得了新的收获。无论是传统剧和现代剧，都呈现出百花齐放的景象。
    滇剧，在解放前受到反动派的残酷摧残，几乎到灭亡的境地，解放后，在党的关怀和大力扶持下，恢复了元气，重新壮大起来，由七零八落不成形的三四个班子，发展到三十四个滇剧团，还有不少正在筹备中的未列入此数，新生力量是一日千里地成长着，剧目在不断的发掘革新着，这是党带给滇剧的新生，提起来全省滇剧艺人都有说不完的感谢党、感谢毛主席的心里话。
    尤其是在整风反右以来，在政治思想及艺术思想上，大大的前进了，滇剧艺人从思想感情上与党更亲密了，在全国各方面都大跃进的形势下，滇剧也出现了轰轰烈烈的跃进局面，各方面取得了空前的成绩，使我们更加深深体会到，没有党，就没有我们，更没有事业的发展和前途，只有好好听党的话，永远跟着党走，才是唯一正确的道路，只有加强了党的领导，滇剧事业才会得到真正的发展和提高。
    滇剧的十年来的成就，首先是政治思想大大提高，广大艺人在党的不断培养教育下，明确了文艺是必须为无产阶级服务，为生产服务。每个团都做到上山下乡，送戏上门，那里有新人新事就演唱歌颂那里，不讲任何条件；在风雪中，在露天底下，在一支蜡烛光前，在深更半夜，在荒山草丛中，都认真的演出。普遍做到积极响应各项政治运动，参加劳动锻炼，大搞政治宣传，深入生活与工农结合，改造思想。大多数青年树立了坚定的事业心，敢想敢做，积极学习传统，继承滇戏事业，广大老艺人积极靠拢党，有不少艺人争取入党入团，其中已有不少加入了党团组织，从而在政治上大大加强了滇剧的队伍。
    由于全省艺人在政治上的跃进，带来了艺术上的新收获。去年围绕着国庆献礼，普遍贯彻了党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”和“两条腿走路”的方针即发展传统又反映现实，尤其是在现代戏的创作上，真是滇剧有史以来的空前盛况。各个剧团都展开群众性的创作，比如曲靖专区剧团，围绕国庆献礼，半年中就创作了一百多个剧目，省滇剧团两个月就创作了四十五个剧目。而且其中有些已上了舞台，连双盲的老艺人，十四岁的小演员，舞台工作人员都投入了创作，壮大了创作队伍，丰富了上演剧目，又真正的做到配合了政治。在传统剧目的整理上，也出了“杨门女将”、“鼓滚刘封”、“火烧博望坡”等等优秀剧目，受到广大群众的喜爱。在导排演上也大跨了一步，省滇剧团排的“两个女红军”开了全省现代戏导表演的现场会议，为今后上演现代戏打下一定基础。更可喜的是滇戏有史以来第一次上了银幕，影片“借亲配”在云南放映时受到了人民欢迎，更鼓舞了艺人的干劲。在国庆献礼前出版了滇剧十年剧本选，两集滇戏音乐，这对发展滇剧更有促进。在培养后一代的工作中，各团抓得很紧，采取与团代班的办法，力争迅速改变过去被反动派摧残而遗留下来的青黄不接的现象。目前，各团有三分之二都是青年，当然这距离社会的需要还远远不足，必须更好更快地迎头赶上。
    总之，大跃进以来，滇剧事业在党的领导下，艺人的努力下，获得空前的丰收。这一切应该归功于党，归功于总路线，这一切就是毛主席文艺思想的胜利，我们感谢党，感谢毛主席。
    1960年是我国高速度跃进的一年，我们高高举起毛主席的文艺思想红旗，在党的领导下，普遍展开学习毛主席思想的学习运动，以毛主席的思想武装我们的头脑，做为一切工作的指南；并继续上山下乡，深入生活，与工农结合改造思想，树立无产阶级的世界观，使我们能真正成为党的忠实的文艺战士，使滇剧成为党的有力的宣传队伍。
    在艺术上，要继续贯彻“两条腿走路”和“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，不断的革新和创造，力争上游，积极向全国其他兄弟剧种学习，争取赶上全国先进水平，拿出尖端剧目，向党的四十周年献礼。并积极培养新生力量，壮大滇戏队伍，千方百计提高艺术质量，力争在三年内，使滇剧迅速地成为名副其实的云南山茶花，使这朵山茶花和全国兄弟剧种一样，开放得五彩缤纷，在建设社会主义，向共产主义迈进的年月里贡献出自己的力量。目前，虽然还存在着干部力量十分不足等等的困难，但是在党的领导下，我们有信心，有决心，加以克服，从而实现我们的愿望。
