Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC."

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, by adhering to the general line of socialist construction, maintaining the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and upholding the People's Commune, the national economy continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in 1959 and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 achieved extremely brilliant results in all aspects of the motherland, laying the foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960 and beyond. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The 1960 national economic plan is a magnificent plan, a plan for continued leap forward. As long as we are under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and better implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, the 1960 national economic plan will certainly be fully and better completed.

I am a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Due to the impact on my health for a long time, I have not made due contributions to the Party and the people. Now I will briefly talk about my personal understanding:

With the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, there has also been a Great Leap Forward in health work. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of medical and health workers have implemented the policy of "serving workers, peasants and soldiers, putting prevention first, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining health work with mass movements," and actively participated in the mass movement centered on "eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases," achieving great results in their work. Traditional Chinese medicine is the crystallization of the experience of our country fighting against diseases for thousands of years, and it contains a large amount of scientific essence. It plays an extremely important role in preventing and treating diseases at present. The Party has always attached great importance to these precious medical heritages of the motherland, and has put forward the policy of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine, inheriting and developing the medical heritage of the motherland" and "using modern scientific methods to sort out and study the medical heritage of the motherland." As a result, the great treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine has been widely explored and utilized, and traditional Chinese medicine has played a significant role in the fight against disease. As a result of the cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, the treatment effect has been greatly improved, which is a victory for the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. Now the Party has proposed to launch a broader mass movement of "eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, changing customs and habits, and transforming the world" throughout the country. This is a great call, and we medical workers should stand on the front line as sentries, playing a vanguard role, and we must strive to achieve a comprehensive and better leap forward in 1960 under the leadership of the Party.

The current situation is very good. The 1960 continued leap forward plan has also brought extremely glorious and arduous tasks to our medical workers. Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and advance along the broad road of socialism.

Finally, I wish all leaders and representatives good health and the success of the conference.

    继承发扬祖国的医学遗产
    石筱山委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和陈叔通副主席所作的“政协第三届全国委员会常委会工作报告”。
    在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，由于坚持了社会主义建设的总路线，坚持了大跃进的发展速度，坚持了人民公社，1959年继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，在祖国各个方面都取得了极其辉煌的成绩，为1960年和以后的持续大跃进奠定了基础，这是我国人民的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。1960年国民经济计划是一个宏伟的计划，是一个继续跃进的计划，只要我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，更好的贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，1960年国民经济计划是肯定能够全面和更好的完成的。
    我是一个中医医务工作者，因为较长时期受了健康方面的影响，没有对党和人民作出应有的贡献，现在我简要的谈一下个人的认识：
    随着1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，在卫生工作方面也出现了大跃进。广大医药卫生工作者在党的领导下贯彻执行了“面向工农兵，预防为主，团结中西医，卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的方针以及积极参加了以“除四害，讲卫生，消灭疾病”为中心的群众运动，在工作上取得了很大的成绩。中医中药是我国几千年来和疾病作斗争的经验结晶，有大量的科学的精华，在当前预防和治疗疾病方面起到了极其重要的作用；对于这些宝贵的祖国医药遗产，党一直给予高度重视的，提出了“团结中西医，继承发扬祖国医学遗产”和“运用现代科学方法整理研究祖国医学遗产”的方针，因而使祖国医药学的伟大宝库得到了广泛的发掘和利用，使中医中药在防治疾病的斗争中发挥了重大的作用，由于中西医合作的结果，治疗效果大大的提高了，这是党的中医政策的胜利。现在党提出了在全国范围内更加广泛地开展“除四害，讲卫生，移风易俗，改造世界”的群众运动，这是一个伟大的号召，我们医务工作者应该站在最前线当一个哨兵，起先锋作用，一定要在党的领导下，为实现1960年全面的更好的跃进而努力。
    当前的形势是十分良好的，1960年继续跃进的计划给我们医务工作者也带来了极其光荣和艰巨的任务，让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进。
    最后祝各位首长、各位代表身体健康，祝大会成功。
