Rural Areas Can Develop Chemical Industries on a Large Scale
Hou Xian, First Secretary of the CCP Dayi County Committee, Sichuan Province

Dayi County is located in the western part of the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan Province and is a major grain-producing area. The county has mineral resources such as coal, iron, sulfur, and gypsum, as well as abundant wild plant resources. The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 created an urgent need for the chemical industry: in order to strive for a greater agricultural harvest, a large amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides were needed; harvested agricultural and sideline products had to be processed and comprehensively utilized; large-scale iron and steel production required products such as sulfuric acid and caustic soda; and the development of local transportation and the construction of farmland water conservancy projects required explosives. Where would so many chemical products come from?

Chemical Industry is Not Mysterious

Generally, people hold a mysterious view of the chemical industry, believing that the chemical industry has many varieties and endless changes. The reaction process is either gaseous or liquid, invisible and intangible, and the production conditions are mostly high temperature, high pressure, or low temperature, vacuum; and there are dangers such as flammability, explosion, and poisoning. It is not easy to run a chemical industry in the city, can it be done in the countryside?

In fact, the development of the chemical industry in rural areas began as early as the first half of 1958. In the spring of that year, in order to meet the high tide of agricultural production in 1958, the broad masses of Dayi County launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production campaign; although the amount of fertilizer accumulated increased greatly, it took a lot of labor, and fertilizer production still could not keep up with agricultural needs. Therefore, all agricultural production cooperatives in the county mobilized the masses to set up chemical fertilizer plants to produce indigenous chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In September 1958, a work group from the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the former Sichuan Provincial Department of Light Industry's Chemical Industry Bureau came to help us with pilot work. Under the inspiration of the work group, the county party committee decided to start developing the chemical industry in a planned way throughout the county.

To develop the chemical industry in rural areas, we must rely on the farmers themselves. Farmers lack culture and do not understand technology. Is it possible to run the chemical industry well?

After a period of practice, it has been proved that the chemical industry is not as mysterious as imagined. General chemical products can be produced by foreign methods, or they can be changed to indigenous methods. If we cannot use foreign methods to produce sulfuric acid, we use the indigenous method of "small tower sulfur," and then we successfully tested the "contact method"; hydrochloric acid, soda ash, chlortetracycline, calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, various chemical pesticides and veterinary drugs were also produced by indigenous methods. Rural areas do not have steel or pottery, but glass has excellent acid and alkali resistance. Farmers do not understand technology, so we build factories, produce, and train at the same time; if they lack culture, we launch a large-scale literacy campaign.

Along this road from low to high, from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, each factory starts with a single product, and then gradually expands the scope of production. When the chemical industry was first started, the only foreign equipment in the county was a 0.75 kW rectifier dismantled from an old car. Now, the chemical industry has grown and prospered on the land of Dayi County like spring flowers and trees.

Chemical Industry and Agriculture are Closely Related

The development of the chemical industry in rural areas is an urgent requirement of agricultural production. The chemical industry supports agriculture in two aspects: one is to supply means of production, and the other is to process agricultural and sideline products to give them greater economic value. For this reason, in terms of product arrangement, according to the urgent need for a large amount of means of production for increasing grain production and developing diversified economy at that time, we focused on developing key products such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary drugs, and veterinary antibiotics; at the same time, we produced sulfuric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, explosives, detonators, fuses and extracted coal tar needed by local industry. The means of production needed in rural areas must be cheap and of good quality. Some people suspect that the use of indigenous methods to produce is economically worthwhile because the chemical industry has many varieties and involves a wide range of technologies. Some people even asserted that the "small indigenous groups" could not pass the technical and economic barriers. After the "small indigenous groups" developed, on the one hand, we resolutely opposed the idea of a few technicians who believed that we should only produce high-end products such as naphthylacetic acid and BHC, "emphasizing foreign over indigenous"; on the other hand, we vigorously expanded the variety, actively improved product quality, and reduced costs. Through continuous improvement of business management, technical transformation of enterprises, and mobilizing the masses to make technological innovations and technological revolutions, we basically broke through the technical and economic barriers in just one year. Because the chemical industry has clarified its service objects and the products produced meet the needs of agricultural production, they are warmly welcomed by the broad masses in rural areas.

In order to further base the chemical industry on serving agricultural production, in 1959 we also adopted the method of planting "experimental fields." Last year, chemical fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, antibiotic plants, and veterinary drug plants all established "experimental fields" and breeding farms near the factories. The products produced by the factory were immediately tested in the "experimental fields" and breeding farms. In order to test the effect of chlortetracycline, the Sanba Antibiotic Plant conducted comparative tests on its products by raising pigs and chickens by the factory itself last year. This not only promptly identified product quality and facilitated further improvement and enhancement, but also made experiments in terms of agricultural production increase, pest control, and fat pig disease treatment, which facilitated wide publicity to farmers and rapid promotion of chemical products and technical guidance for farmers on the use of chemical products. Therefore, planting "experimental fields" not only directly helped the industrial sector to improve its production level, but more importantly, it enabled industry and agriculture to be better integrated and promoted each other.

Establish a Rural Chemical Industry Network

In order for the chemical industry to better serve agricultural production, according to the characteristics of multi-variety production, while developing major products, we must be determined to develop basic chemical industries such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and soda ash. Basic chemical industry is the prerequisite for the development of all chemical industries. When Dayi County initially developed the chemical industry, it lacked "three acids" and "two alkalis." With phosphate rock powder, it could not be processed into superphosphate, and it was impossible to produce pesticides, veterinary drugs, and explosives; in the first half of last year, sulfuric acid production was abnormal, and even affected the Humic acid plant to stop production. Later, we developed the basic chemical industry, which put the county's chemical industry on the right track; at the same time, with the basic chemical industry, it also created conditions for further development of the chemical industry.

The chemical industry not only has many varieties, but also the products are interrelated. After the factories are built, they must be unified in leadership, strengthen cooperation, and arrange production in a unified manner. For example, mirabilite is the raw material for soda ash, chlorine is needed for manufacturing pesticides and hydrochloric acid, and most products require acids and alkalis. Therefore, shortly after the establishment of the factory, we established a chemical industry general factory, which is responsible for leading the production and business of the county's county-run chemical factories. Under unified leadership, the county's chemical industry has moved in step, promoted each other, improved product quality, and reduced costs, ensuring the completion of production tasks on time, with quality, and in quantity. According to the experience of Dayi County, the development of various chemical products should also proceed from the perspective of benefiting agricultural production and pay attention to the rational layout of factories. Generally speaking, it is not advisable to build factories too dispersed, and to minimize the long-distance transportation of raw materials, fuels, and finished products, so as to avoid excessive occupation of rural labor in transportation, increase industrial production costs, and cause production difficulties.

Rural areas will inevitably encounter many difficulties in terms of technology and resources in order to produce a variety of chemical products. In addition to planning and focusing on the development of varieties according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the possible conditions in all aspects, Dayi County tried every means to overcome difficulties in technology and resources and widely opened up sources of raw materials. For example, in the manufacture of pesticides, we used lime and sulfur to make lime sulfur mixture; used charcoal and sulfur to produce carbon disulfide; and also used furfural dry distillation liquid; without sulfur for sulfuric acid production, pyrite and gypsum (magnesium sulfide) can be used as raw materials. Mastering the principle of chemical change and applying various methods technologically can not only expand the scope of raw materials, but also make full use of decentralized resources, and waste can also be comprehensively utilized. From this point of view, the development prospects of the chemical industry are unlimited. Dayi County knew very few resources before 1958. After the development of industries such as iron and steel and chemicals, many mineral deposits such as iron ore, sulfur, realgar, and salt were slowly discovered. Although the reserves of these minerals are not large, they are a valuable asset for local industry.

Take the County Seat as the Center and Gradually Promote it to the Communes

The county seat is the center of rural economic activity. Developing the chemical industry with the county seat as the main focus and gradually promoting it to the people's communes can not only promote the development of the chemical industry, but also closely integrate the chemical industry with agriculture. In 1958, agricultural production cooperatives and people's communes in Dayi County started the chemical industry with indigenous methods. Although they produced a lot of indigenous chemical fertilizers and pesticides, further improvement was greatly restricted. The chemical industry cannot stay at the primitive level for a long time. Therefore, when we developed the chemical industry in a planned way, we first focused on running key factories in the county seat in order to gradually promote them to the people's communes and help the people's communes to improve.

The best form of combination of county and commune chemical industries is first of all the demonstration effect of county-run chemical industries. To this end, in the initial stage of starting the chemical industry, we concentrated our efforts to first strengthen the seventeen backbone factories under the county. All the experimental research work in terms of business management and technology started from the backbone factories, summed up experience, made models, and then promoted them to the people's communes. For example, veterinary drugs and pesticides were first developed by backbone factories, and then developed to the people's communes. Basic chemical products such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and caustic soda were improved in design, simplified in production process, and successfully produced by indigenous methods, and then promoted to the people's communes.

The daily production contact between county and commune chemical industries is to establish direct guidance and assistance relationships at the county, commune, management area, and production team levels, which have both division of labor and close cooperation, organizing the county's chemical industry into an organic whole to achieve the purpose of common promotion. The method we adopted is to have the county seat run all the important products such as sulfuric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, and mirabilite, which have a large output and complex technology. Because the county seat has better material and technical conditions, it can also mobilize the county's resources and control the unified distribution of products. People's communes produce indigenous chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and small amounts of chlortetracycline and sodium humate according to the needs of agricultural production and their own strength; at the same time, they provide crude products, semi-finished products, and raw materials such as starch and vinegar stone to county-run chemical industries. In terms of cooperation, in addition to supplying basic chemical products and antibiotic seeds to the people's communes, the county-run chemical industries focus on strengthening technical guidance to the commune-run chemical factories, training technical forces, identifying products, summarizing and improving product quality, and helping to carry out laboratory work, giving full play to the base role of the county seat. The people's communes also strengthen guidance and assistance to the management areas and production teams. This enables the chemical industry to be quickly popularized and promoted to the people's communes.

    农村可以大办化学工业
    中共四川省大邑县委第一书记　侯宪
    大邑县位于川西平原西部，是四川省的主要粮食产区。县境有煤、铁、硫磺、石膏等矿产资源以及大量的野生植物资源。1958年工农业生产大跃进，对化学工业提出了迫切的要求：为了争取农业更大丰收，需要大量的化学肥料和农药；丰收后的农副产品必须加工处理实行综合利用；大办钢铁需要硫酸、烧碱等产品；发展地方交通事业、兴修农田水利要炸药。这样多的化工产品从哪里来？
    化学工业并不玄妙
    一般人对化学工业都抱有神秘观点，认为化学工业品种多，变化无穷。反应过程非气即水，看不见，摸不着，生产条件多是高温、高压，或低温、真空；又有易燃、爆炸、中毒等危险。城市办化学工业还不容易，农村能办吗？
    农村发展化学工业，事实上早在1958年上半年就开始了。这一年春天，大邑县广大群众为迎接1958年农业生产高潮，大规模开展了积肥、造肥运动；积肥数量虽然大大增加，但花了很多劳动力，肥料生产还是赶不上农业的需要。于是全县所有农业生产合作社都发动群众办化肥厂生产土化肥，大搞土农药。1958年9月，中央化工部和原四川省轻工业厅化工局派来了一个工作组，帮助我们搞试点工作，在工作组的启发下，县委决定在全县范围内开始有计划地发展化学工业。
    在农村发展化学工业，要依靠农民自己办。农民一缺少文化，二不懂技术，有没有可能把化学工业办好？
    经过一段实践，证明化学工业并不像想像中的那样神秘。一般化工产品可以用洋法生产，也可以改成土法生产。搞硫酸不能用洋法，我们就用土法“小塔硫”，进一步又试验成功了“接触法”；盐酸、纯碱、土霉素、钙镁磷肥，各种化学农药和兽药也先后用土办法生产出来。农村没有钢材、陶器，玻璃却具有很好的耐酸耐碱性能。农民不懂技术，我们就边建厂、边生产、边训练；缺少文化，就大搞扫盲运动。
    沿着这条由低到高，由土到洋，由小到大的道路，各厂先从单一产品搞起，然后逐步扩大生产范围。初办化学工业的时候，全县唯一的洋设备只有一个从旧汽车上拆下来的零点七五瓩的整流器，现在，化学工业已像春天的花木一样在大邑县的土地上成长壮大起来。
    化学工业与农业是血肉关系
    农村发展化学工业，是农业生产的迫切要求。化学工业支援农业有两个方面：一是供给生产资料，一是对农副产品进行加工，使其发挥更大的经济价值。为此，在产品安排上，根据当时农业增产粮食和发展多种经济迫切需要大量生产资料的情况，我们着重发展了化肥、农药、兽药、畜用抗菌素等重点产品；同时，生产地方工业需要的硫酸、烧碱、纯碱、炸药、雷管、导火线和提取煤焦油。农村需要的生产资料必须做到价廉物美，有的人因为化学工业品种比较多，涉及的技术范围广，怀疑用土办法生产在经济上是否合算。甚至有人断定“小土群”过不了技术关和经济关。“小土群”发展起来后，我们一方面坚决反对了少数技术人员认为要搞就搞萘乙酸、六六六等高级产品“重洋轻土”的思想；另一方面，大力扩大品种，积极提高产品质量，降低成本。经过不断改进经营管理，对企业进行技术改造，发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命。为时不过一年就基本上突破了技术关和经济关。由于化学工业明确了服务对象，生产出来的产品是符合农业生产需要的，因此在农村里受到了广大群众的热情欢迎。
    为了进一步把化学工业建立在为农业生产服务的基础上，1959年我们又采取了种“试验田”的方法。化肥厂、农药厂、抗菌素厂、兽药厂去年都在工厂附近普遍建立了“试验田”和饲养场。厂里生产的产品立即在“试验田”和饲养场进行试验。三八抗菌素厂为了试验土霉素的效果，去年由工厂自己养猪养鸡对产品进行了对比试验。这样既及时鉴定了产品质量，便于进一步改进和提高，又对农业增产、治虫与肥猪治病等方面作出了实验，便于向农民群众进行广泛宣传，迅速推广化工产品和指导农民使用化工产品的技术。因此种“试验田”不仅直接帮助工业部门提高了生产水平，更重要的是使工业和农业更好地结合起来，互相促进。
    建立农村化学工业网
    化学工业要更好地为农业生产服务，根据多品种生产的特点，在发展主要产品的同时，必须下决心把硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、烧碱、纯碱等基本化学工业发展起来。基本化学工业是发展一切化学工业的前提。大邑县最初发展化学工业因为缺少“三酸”、“两碱”，有了磷矿粉不能加工成过磷酸钙，没法生产农药、兽药和炸药；去年上半年硫酸生产不正常，甚至影响到胡敏酸厂停产。后来我们把基本化学工业发展起来了，才使全县化学工业走上了正轨；同时有了基本化学工业，也为进一步发展化学工业创造了条件。
    化学工业不仅品种多，而且产品之间是相互关联的。工厂建设起来后必须统一领导，加强协作，统一安排生产。比如芒硝是纯碱的原料，制造农药和盐酸都需要氯气，绝大部分产品又都少不了酸碱。因此我们在建厂不久后就成立了化工总厂，负责领导全县县办化工厂的生产业务。在统一领导下，使全县化学工业步调一致，共同促进，提高产品质量和降低成本，保证了按时、按质、按量完成生产任务。根据大邑县的经验，搞多种化工产品还应该从有利于支援农业生产出发，注意工厂的合理布局。一般说来，建厂不宜过于分散，尽可能减少原料、燃料和成品的远距离运输，以免在运输上过多地占用农村劳动力，增加工业生产成本，造成生产上的困难。
    农村要生产多种化工产品，在技术上、资源上难免会遇到许多困难。大邑县除了在安排品种时，首先根据工农业生产需要和各方面的可能条件有计划地重点发展外，在技术上和资源上则想尽一切办法战胜困难，广泛开辟原料来源。例如，制造农药，我们使用石灰、硫磺制造了石硫合剂；用木炭、硫磺生产过二硫化炭；也使用了糠醛干馏液；生产硫酸没有硫磺，硫铁矿、石膏（硫化镁）都可作为原料。掌握了化学变化的原理，技术上运用多种方法，既可扩大原料范围，又可充分利用分散资源，废物也可以综合利用。从这个观点上来说，化学工业的发展前途是无限的。大邑县在1958年以前所知道的资源也很少，钢铁、化学等工业发展起来后，才慢慢发现了铁矿、硫磺、雄黄、食盐等许多矿藏。这些矿种藏量虽然不大，但对地方工业来说却是一笔宝贵的财富。
    以县城为中心，逐步向公社推广
    县城是农村经济活动的中心。以县城为主发展化学工业，逐步向人民公社推广，既有利于促进化学工业的发展，又能使化学工业与农业紧密结合。1958年大邑县农业生产合作社和人民公社用土办法办起了化学工业，虽然生产了不少土化肥和土农药，但是要进一步提高却受到了很大限制。化学工业不能长期停留在原始水平上。于是我们有计划地发展化学工业时就首先在县城办好重点厂，以便逐步向人民公社推广，并帮助人民公社提高。
    县、社化学工业结合的最好形式，首先是县办化学工业的示范作用。为此我们在开办化学工业的最初阶段，集中力量先加强县属十七个骨干厂，凡是经营管理方面和技术上的试验研究工作，都先从骨干厂开始，摸出经验，作出样板，再推广到人民公社。例如，兽药、农药都先由骨干厂搞起来，再发展到人民公社去。硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、烧碱等基本化工产品，经过改进设计，简化生产流程，用土办法生产成功后，再推广到人民公社去。
    县、社化学工业日常生产上的联系，是县、社、管理区、生产队层层建立直接指导和帮助关系，既有分工，又密切协作，把全县化学工业组织成一个有机的整体，达到共同促进的目的。我们采取的方法，是将产量较大、技术比较复杂的硫酸、纯碱、烧碱、芒硝等重要产品，一律由县城举办。因为县城除物质、技术条件较好外，还可以调动全县资源，掌握产品的统一分配。人民公社则根据农业生产需要和自己的力量，生产土化肥、土农药，以及小量的土霉素和胡敏酸钠；同时向县办化学工业提供粗制品、半成品和淀粉、醋石等原料。在协作方面，县办化学工业除了供给人民公社基本化工产品、抗菌素种子等外，着重对社办化工厂加强技术指导，培训技术力量，鉴定产品，总结和提高产品质量，帮助进行化验工作，充分发挥县城的基地作用。人民公社也同样对管理区、生产队加强指导和帮助。这样就使化学工业能够迅速向人民公社普及和推广。
