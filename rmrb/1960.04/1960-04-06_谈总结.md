On Summarization
Wu Lü

Jilin Province is conducting a province-wide major inspection and summarization of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Today's news reports that in Jilin City, which started the effort earliest, through holding on-site meetings and summarizing and exchanging experiences, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has increased by 8.3% compared to before the summarization, and the labor force saved has increased from more than 5,000 people to more than 10,000 people. Summarizing experiences has generated new strength; this is one example.

Why does summarizing experiences generate new strength? In the final analysis, this is because summarizing experiences is the only way to improve understanding. Through summarizing experiences, people's understanding of objective reality is improved, which can then have a reciprocal effect on the development of objective reality. We know that people's understanding of objective reality always progresses from not knowing to knowing, and from knowing little and superficially to knowing more and more deeply. However, this process of deepening understanding does not happen spontaneously but follows the path of constantly generalizing, reasoning, and judging, raising perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. This is the law of cognition. Summarizing experiences follows this law of cognition, prompting our understanding of objective reality to move from less to more, from shallow to deeper, and from relatively one-sided to more comprehensive, thus making the subjective more in line with the objective and enabling it to have a greater impact on objective development.

Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached importance to summarizing experiences, considering it a Marxist-Leninist working method of "from the masses, to the masses" and "from practice, to practice." They advocate that experiences should be summarized in a timely manner when work comes to an end or when a movement is about to enter a new stage. In the past, whether it was summarizing the successive domestic revolutionary wars, the socialist revolution, or socialist construction, all have pushed the revolution and construction to new heights. Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has developed into a great movement. This movement is a revolution in productivity, but it is not just a revolution in productivity. Due to the vigorous development of productive forces, it also requires continuous reform of the relations of production and the superstructure. Therefore, the content of the movement is extremely rich, and it has achieved great success to date, urgently requiring summarization of experiences. Through summarization, enhancing understanding, and strengthening leadership, the movement will inevitably achieve greater development on the correct, scientific, and national track.

However, the effect of summarization also varies in magnitude. This largely depends on the mass character of the summarization. Summarization comes from practice and returns to practice. The masses are directly involved in production practice. Widely mobilizing the masses to summarize experiences, so that the understanding of the broad masses is universally improved in the summarization, can have a widespread effect on production practice. A small number of people summarizing behind closed doors, detached from the masses and from reality, will not only be unable to make correct summaries that conform to objective reality; even if they do make correct summaries, if they cannot be grasped by the masses, it is impossible for them to have an effect on the development of production. Jilin Province's organization of a national major inspection and summarization, with everyone moving from top to bottom, inspecting layer by layer from teams and workshops, and summarizing layer by layer, combining the mass summarization with the leadership's summarization, is a very good method of summarizing.

    谈总结
    吴滤
    吉林省正在全省范围内对技术革新和技术革命运动进行大检查、大总结。今天报上的消息说：动手最早的吉林市，在检查总结的过程中，通过召开现场会议和总结交流经验等等活动，全市机械化和半机械化的程度又比总结以前提高了8.3％，节约的劳动力由五千多人增加到一万多人。总结经验产生了新的力量，这是一个例子。
    总结经验为什么能产生新的力量呢？归根到底，这是因为总结经验是提高认识的必由之路。通过总结经验，人们对客观实际的认识有了提高，就能反作用于客观实际的发展。我们知道，人们对客观实际的认识，总是从不知到知、从知得不多不深到知得更多更深的。但是，这个认识的深化过程并不是自发地进行的，而是循着不断地概括、推理、判断，把感性认识提高到理性认识的途径进行的，这是认识的规律。总结经验就是根据这个认识的规律，促使我们对客观实际的认识由不多到更多、由不深到更深，由比较片面到比较全面，从而使主观更加符合客观，能更大地作用于客观的发展。
    我们党和毛泽东同志向来都重视总结经验，认为这是一种从群众中来到群众中去、从实践中来到实践中去的马克思列宁主义的工作方法，提倡工作告一段落或者运动快要进入一个新的阶段的时候，都要及时总结经验。过去，无论是对历次国内革命战争的总结，无论是对社会主义革命的总结，无论是对社会主义建设的总结，都把革命和建设推向新的高潮。现在，技术革新和技术革命运动已经发展成一个伟大的运动。这个运动是个生产力大革命的运动，又不只是生产力大革命的运动。由于生产力的蓬勃发展，还要求不断地对生产关系和上层建筑进行改革。因而运动的内容是极其丰富的，发展到现在也已得到伟大的成就，急需总结经验。通过总结，提高认识，加强领导，运动必然会在正确的科学的全民的轨道上得到更大的发展。
    然而，总结的作用也有大小之不等。这在很大程度上取决于总结的群众性。总结来自实践，又回到实践中去。群众是直接参加生产实践的。广泛发动群众来总结经验，使广大群众的认识在总结中普遍得到提高，就能对生产实践发生广泛的作用。少数人关起门来总结，脱离群众、脱离实际，不但不可能做出符合客观实际的正确的总结来；即便做出正确的总结，不能为群众所掌握，也不可能对生产的发展发生作用。吉林省组织全民性的大检查大总结，上下一齐动，从小组、工段起，层层检查，层层做总结，把群众性的总结和领导上的总结结合起来，是一个很好的做总结的方法。
