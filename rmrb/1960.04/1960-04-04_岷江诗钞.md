    Min River Poetry Collection
    Deng Lin
    Building a Road
    Splitting open the steep cliffs,
    To build a road,
    Head at the dam site's east,
    Tail in the depths of white clouds.
    No need for Nüwa's five-colored stones,
    No borrowing Chenxiang's mountain-splitting axe,
    No inviting Erlang to carry mountains,
    No fearing the jealousy of immortals!
    Steel drills rise and fall, flashing silver light,
    Frightening away flower-bearing wild deer;
    A single cannon blast opens the heavenly gate,
    Shaking down countless celestial stars!
    A sharp knife cuts through the green mountains,
    White clouds fly in to fill the gaps,
    Pine branches are covered in dew,
    Wisteria vines climb onto the railings.
    The road is a root of a tie,
    Holding together the wind drills and blueprints;
    Unfold the blueprints to raise wind and thunder,
    Twist the wind drills to create smoke and mist!
    The river water rushes like an arrow,
    The road extends with divine speed.
    Let the equipment flow along the road,
    Let the electricity be sent along the Min River!
    Building an iron chain bridge, goose feathers can't float on the water,
    Separated by the river, how could it be only a thousand miles?
    People on both sides do not intermarry,
    Every year they drink the water from the river together!
    There is a bridge in the Milky Way in the sky,
    There is a road on Mount Hua on the ground.
    Raging waves crash against the beach,
    Only the Min River cannot be crossed!
    How can there be a great river that cannot be crossed?
    How can there be a high mountain that cannot be opened?
    High mountains and great rivers only locked with iron locks for the ancients,
    Today, let's see us come!
    The Party has given me the iron hammer,
    Wield the iron hammer to open the iron lock;
    Effort melts Mount Baitou,
    Flags all over the mountain are redder than fire.
    Wild water howls, the Big Dipper is high,
    Steel ropes bind the evil dragon's waist,
    Defeated scales and broken armor pave the road,
    Sweep away the clouds and build a flying bridge!
    Order the Ao fish to carry the bridge piers,
    Don't allow the Ao fish to blink!
    From now on, the Min River's songs are even louder,
    A seven-stringed zither hangs horizontally across the river!
    People on the south bank clap their hands and laugh,
    People on the north bank's hearts leap,
    A burst of cheers, ten thousand flowers,
    The car has driven across the bridge!

    岷江诗钞
    邓林
    修马路
    劈开悬岩陡壁，
    来修一条马路，
    头在坝址东边，
    尾在白云深处。
    不用女娲五彩石，
    不借沉香劈山斧，
    不请二郎担山，
    不怕神仙嫉妒！
    钢钎起落闪银光，
    惊走含花野鹿；
    一声炮响开天门，
    震落辰星无数！
    快刀斩断青山，
    白云飞来填补，
    松枝结满露珠，
    葛藤牵上栏杆柱。
    马路是根纽带，
    系住风钻和蓝图；
    展开图卷起风雷，
    扭动风钻生烟雾！
    江水奔腾似箭，
    马路伸延神速。
    让器材顺着马路流来，
    让电力沿着岷江送去！
    架铁索桥水上鹅毛浮不起，
    隔江何止隔千里？
    两岸人家不通婚，
    年年共饮江中水！
    天上银河也有桥，
    地上华山也有路。
    奔腾恶浪扑沙滩，
    惟有岷江不可渡！
    那有大河不可渡？
    那有高山打不开？
    高山大河只向古人关铁锁，
    今朝且看我们来！
    党把铁锤交给了我，
    挥动铁锤开铁锁；
    干劲熔化白头山，
    满山旗帜红于火。
    野水嚎啕北斗高，
    钢绳缚住孽龙腰，
    败鳞残甲铺成路，
    打扫云雾架飞桥！
    责令鳌鱼背桥墩，
    不准鳌鱼眨眼睛！
    从此岷江歌声更嘹亮，
    拦河横挂七弦琴！
    南岸人家拍手笑，
    北岸人家心直跳，
    一片欢呼万朵花，
    汽车开过桥来了！
