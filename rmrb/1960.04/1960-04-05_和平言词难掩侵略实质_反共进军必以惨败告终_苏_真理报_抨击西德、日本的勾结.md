    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 3rd: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on April 3rd: A "Pravda" correspondent in Tokyo pointed out in a commentary on Adenauer's visit to Tokyo that the heads of government of West Germany and Japan have once again declared their intention to unite in a crusade against communism. The current establishment of a German-Japanese alliance is not only identical to the previously established German-Japanese alliance in its purpose, but also in the means adopted to achieve this purpose.
    The article stated that Japan and West Germany have now joined the United States in aggressive military blocs aimed at opposing the countries of the socialist camp. The planners of the new anti-communist crusade are already redrawing the borders of neighboring countries on maps. The hypocritical words of peace in the Adenauer visit communique cannot hide these facts from the international public. Kishi Nobusuke and Adenauer are attempting to revive the notorious "Axis" on the basis of an arms race, especially a nuclear arms race. The "coincidence" of Adenauer's visit to Japan with the Japanese government's announcement of its decision to increase military spending in 1960 is not accidental.
    The article concluded that the knights of the new anti-communist crusade are beating the drums of war. But it is clear to everyone that this unwise crusade will only end in the complete failure of its participants.

    和平言词难掩侵略实质  反共进军必以惨败告终
    苏“真理报”抨击西德、日本的勾结
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联“真理报”驻东京记者在一篇评论阿登纳东京之行的文章中指出，西德和日本两国政府首脑再次宣布他们要为反对共产主义而联合进军。他们现在建立日德联盟同过去建立的日德联盟不仅在目的上是相同的，而且为实现这个目的所采取的手段也是相同的。
    文章说，现在，日本和西德都已经同美国一道参加了旨在反对社会主义阵营各国的侵略性军事集团。新的反共进军的策划者已经在地图上重划邻国的疆界。阿登纳访日公报中的假惺惺的和平言词无法向国际公众隐瞒这些事实。岸信介和阿登纳企图在军备竞赛的基础上，特别是在原子军备竞赛的基础上复活臭名昭彰的“轴心”。阿登纳的访日同日本政府宣布决定增加1960年的军事开支一事的“巧合”不是偶然的。
    文章最后说，新的反共进军的骑士敲起战鼓。但是谁都清楚，这个不明智的进军只会以它的参加者的完全失败而告终。
