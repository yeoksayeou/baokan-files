Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

    I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. The practice of continuous great leaps forward over the past two years and the current widespread technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation have once again proven that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will surely move from victory to new and greater victories. Since December of last year, the people of Taiyuan City have launched a high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Over the past few months, the movement has swept across the city, rapidly forming a magnificent situation of great technological revolution, great scientific leap forward, great production development, great ideological improvement, and great cultural popularization.

    The trend of the movement is that the scale is becoming more and more magnificent, the momentum is becoming more and more massive, and it is truly becoming a great revolutionary movement of the whole people. The broad masses of workers and staff in the industrial and transportation sectors are enthusiastically engaged in innovation. Not only has the production sector created all kinds of mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated equipment, changing the technical landscape day by day, but also the functional departments, which were not very active in previous movements, are also enthusiastically engaged in innovation and have achieved great success. For example, the design department has created a series of new design methods such as calculation charting and drawing templating, so that all design work procedures such as calculation, drawing, translation, and statistics are freed from tedious and repetitive labor. The physical and chemical testing department created a carbon-sulfur automatic analyzer, which automates all sixteen manual operations such as pinpointing, balancing, and recording continuously. Under the impetus of the industrial and transportation sectors, commercial services, finance, culture, health, and even streets and communes have been involved in the movement. For example, the finance and accounting departments have changed the old practice of "facing the glass plate and typing one, two, three" for many years to "counting tickets without hands and automatic transfer of vouchers." Canteens and restaurants have not only introduced steam for steaming, boiling, and disinfecting, mechanization of manual operations, and gasification of cooking, stir-frying, and grilling, but even some units have mechanized the frying of fried dough sticks and making of sesame cakes. All walks of life in the city are carrying out technological reforms in various aspects according to the requirements of production and work development, which is truly rich and colorful. The whole city has seen a moving scene of "daily innovation, everyone creating, and miracles in every walk of life."

    The widespread development of the mass movement has enabled the content of innovation to quickly develop from individual general reforms to systematic reforms of the entire enterprise and the entire industry, and then to comprehensive technological transformation. On the basis of continuous individual innovations, the forging workers in the city used 20 days to end the history of manual operation, realizing mechanization of all processes from forging and turning materials to lifting and transportation and furnace door lifting. The basic construction department has also developed from sporadic innovations to the formation of a complete set of machinery, so that all processes of the three major types of work: concrete, steel, and woodwork, adopt advanced machinery and continuous production operation. In order to adapt to the requirements of production development and technological transformation, the internal transportation of many factories has realized the network of ground rails and aerial ropeways. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling in the city has increased from the original average of about 10% to 65%, with the highest reaching about 95%. As of now, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the industrial and transportation departments in the city has increased from the original 42% to 62.28%. In the 2,714 types of work, more than 1,800 have been freed from manual operation and heavy physical labor. Many enterprises, while expanding the achievements of mechanization, further developed to innovate the entire equipment and change the entire production line. The cotton and wool weaving factory was originally a handicraft production cooperative with only one tiger-head pliers and twelve handicraft workers. After several years of continuous efforts, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization reached 30%, and in this "four modernizations" movement, it quickly increased to 84%. The Taiyuan Tobacco Factory, with its outdated equipment, has realized a mechanized production line from raw material input to product boxing and warehousing through technological transformation, reducing the number of machine operators by one-third to two-thirds. The production cycle is shortened by 90%, and the annual production capacity is increased by one and a half times. Not only can enterprises with a poor foundation quickly improve the degree of mechanization, but also enterprises with a higher degree of machinery can move towards higher mechanization and automation after liberating their minds. For example, the Taiyuan Chemical Plant realized instrumentation in the main workshops of the entire plant in two months. Two sections used instruments to automatically measure, inspect, and adjust the production process, basically becoming "unmanned sections." In the electrolysis workshop, as long as one person operates the instruments, he can control 280 electrolysis tanks at the bottom layer. Two hundred and forty automated and semi-automated production lines and linkage lines have emerged in the city, increasing 754 automated and semi-automated single machines. Because manual operation is mechanized, and then developed to the higher goals of overall mechanization and automation, industrial production can be transferred to a new technological basis at a faster speed, and advanced equipment and advanced operating methods can be used to develop production at a high speed.

    With the continued deepening of the movement, the broad masses of workers and staff, with indomitable spirit, actively adopted new technologies, mass-produced high-quality, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new products, and combined scientific research to march towards cutting-edge technologies. The mechanical system has adopted ultrasonic technology in cutting, cleaning, welding, flaw detection, etc. Many enterprises have also adopted new technologies such as program-controlled machine tools and remote control of cranes. The mass scientific research activities that came with the climb to the peak of technology have also been carried out more widely. Many of the larger factories and mines have hundreds or even thousands of employees participating in scientific research. Scientific research institutions and universities have also organized more than 1,000 people to combine with enterprise employees to conduct scientific research. This has more powerfully promoted the improvement of technical level.

    The high-speed development and large-scale harvest of the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement have promoted the great leap forward in production and realized a good start in production. In the first quarter of this year, the labor productivity of industrial workers and staff in the city increased by 72.6% compared with the same period last year; the total industrial output value in the first quarter exceeded the plan six days ahead of schedule, an increase of 10.92% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the average daily output level increased by 22%. The "conventional" that the production in the first quarter of previous years was lower than the fourth quarter of the previous year has been overturned. Since the launch of the movement, more than 54,000 workers and staff have been saved (equivalent to one-sixth of the total number of employees in the city), completing the task of saving 40,000 to 50,000 labor force three months ahead of schedule. The people of the city are confidently striving to improve the level of mechanization and automation more quickly, and to save more labor force in the case of doubling the industrial output value and putting 200 newly built and expanded projects into production.

    The continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization and automation not only means the increasing growth of social wealth, but also means the decreasing amount of labor required to create unit products, greatly improving the working conditions of workers. When workers are freed from backward tools and master machines, they burst out with infinite joy from the bottom of their hearts. Forging workers happily said: "In the past, sweat soaked through shirts in the cold winter months, with sore waists, legs, and arms; now, we stand aside and make gestures, not hot, not tired, and with high output." Because manual operation has become mechanical operation, the broad masses of workers and staff are eager to improve their culture and technology, and in fact it is possible to take more time to engage in the study of culture, technology, and political theory. The attendance rate of workers and staff in many enterprises participating in cultural study has risen from about 60% in the past to more than 90% now. The number of workers and staff participating in spare-time study in the city accounts for 80% of the total number of workers and staff, of which those participating in spare-time universities account for 85% of the number of people who should be enrolled. Sixteen workers from the Jinxi Machine Factory will complete their spare-time university courses in the summer of this year and become the first batch of graduates from spare-time universities. In particular, more than 130,000 workers participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works, which has far-reaching significance for improving the ideological awareness of workers and staff, promoting the development of technological revolution, and realizing the continuous leap forward in production.

    The technological revolution movement not only changes the backwardness of production technology, but also profoundly changes people's spiritual outlook. The communist style of breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and daring to think and act has been further promoted. The story of "two teacups making revolution" is that two local experts and two apprentices from the Taiyuan Paint Factory used two enamel teacups as experimental equipment under very simple technical conditions. After many experiments, they finally successfully tested chemical raw materials such as methyl acetate, which are needed for the production of high-grade paints. With the tremendous changes in the mechanization of manual operations, the collectivist ideology and organization and discipline of the working class have been further enhanced, and a new type of relationship of unity, cooperation, and mutual promotion between people has been further developed. The form of "three combinations" has been more widely used inside and outside the factory, and the new style of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, rushing to overcome difficulties, and giving convenience" and noble moral qualities are developing day by day. The employees of some enterprises have created the form of "Communist Collaboration Labor Day" to overcome difficulties and break through key points. They focus on the key and weak links of production and use public holidays to carry out mass mutual support, helping backward units to successfully complete technological innovation and production tasks. The great improvement of ideological awareness and the great development of creative wisdom have formed a great force, promoting the technological revolution to develop forward more vigorously along the correct, scientific, and mass road.

    In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on vigorous mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, while strengthening overall leadership, we focused on the following aspects:

    First, from the city to factories, mines, workshops, work sections, and groups, we comprehensively formulated plans, and organized several campaigns with steps and preparations to achieve them in stages. The formulation of the plan is centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and is combined with comprehensive technological transformation; it focuses on breaking through weak links, and also blooms in all directions; it grasps general innovation and also grasps cutting-edge technology. Facts have proved that such a broad mass movement as technological innovation and technological revolution, including reforming operating procedures, transforming equipment, improving labor organization, and comprehensively utilizing raw materials, can only drive the entire technical work and management work more effectively and organizationally by making overall plans around the key to production. Under the guidance of overall planning, organizing several campaigns in a planned way can have both long-term plans and short-term arrangements. We have successively achieved the victory of two campaigns and started the third campaign on March 1st. Each campaign has a clear main direction, concentrating superior forces to achieve it in stages and batches. Each campaign is closely linked, the previous campaign prepares conditions for the next campaign, and the next campaign expands the results for the previous campaign, thereby ensuring that the movement develops forward with waves pushing forward, one wave higher than the other. Many units also adopted the "five-determination" method of determining projects, determining progress, determining measures, determining special personnel, and regularly inspecting, and the system of hierarchical responsibility, that is, large projects are responsible by the factory, medium projects are responsible by the workshop, and small projects are responsible by the group. As a result, the development of the movement is both vigorous and solid.

    Second, vigorously carry out mass movements, carry out mass training, mass competitions, and mass performances, comprehensively promote advanced experiences, and combine them with competition movements to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward, so that the advanced level can quickly become the social production level. The broad masses of workers and staff have mastered new technologies through training, discovered and selected the most advanced technologies and experiences through competitions, made them a complete set, and systematically promoted advanced technologies and experiences through performances. Then train, compare, and perform again, so on and so forth, continuously improve, and continuously improve. Individuals, collectives, masters, apprentices, production departments, and functional departments participate in this competition, which is large in scale and strong in combat effectiveness. More than 80% of the employees in the city participated in the training competition. According to the statistics of 52 units, 548,000 people (times) participated in the competition performance in three months, and 1,056 types of competition projects were reached. Through this competition performance, more than 800 items of experience were matched into sets by taking the advantages of each other to make up for the shortcomings, so that the sporadic and scattered innovation experiences gradually reached systematicness and completeness, forming a "one-stop shop." The process of this experience matching is not only a competition, but also a paper; it is not only a process of concentration, analysis, research, identification, and innovation; it is also a process of popularizing and improving advanced experiences; it is also a process of widely publicizing the advanced ideas of innovation experts. Through the competition, one-half of the workers in the First Machine Tool Factory reached 15 to 25 times the quota of working hours. In leading the movement, we have always paid attention to grasping both ends to bring the middle, held on-site meetings in advanced units first, and also held on-site meetings in backward units, so as to promote the advanced to be more advanced and the backward to catch up with the advanced quickly, so as to achieve common improvement.

    Third, adhere to the two-legged walking policy of combining local production methods with foreign production methods, and combining self-reliance with mutual cooperation. Throughout the movement, we started with the transformation of old equipment, and used local methods to manufacture simple equipment, gradually from local to foreign, from rough to fine, and continuously improved, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses and achieving remarkable results.

    With the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization, we predicted that the raw material problem would inevitably become more prominent. Faced with this situation, we adopted the "one-stop" use of materials within the enterprise, organized the "one-stop" use of raw materials in the city-wide scope between enterprises, and vigorously carried out the comprehensive utilization of various raw materials. These three forms are mutually conditional and mutually complementary, which not only effectively overcomes the difficulty of insufficient certain raw materials, but also enables resources to be fully and comprehensively utilized. The utilization rate of steel in the city has increased from 70% last year to 80% to 85%, and advanced units have reached more than 95%. The utilization rate of wood, rubber, etc. has also increased by 10% to 15%, and 15 waste-free factories have emerged. The "one-stop" use of raw materials and comprehensive utilization have become an important aspect of the technological revolution and have promoted the development of the movement.

    Fourth, strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for the smooth development of the entire movement. The primary link of the Party's leadership is to strengthen ideological leadership, educate the masses with a constantly revolutionary proletarian world outlook to liberate their minds, break superstitions, establish lofty ambitions, and constantly arouse revolutionary drive. Facts have proved that to further arm enterprises materially and technically, we must first arm employees with revolutionary ideas. "Technological innovation, ideological vanguard," only with continuous ideological leaps forward can technology be continuously improved. At the same time, pay attention to discovering and actively supporting the growth of new things, and grasp them firmly as soon as they show up. According to the new situation of the improvement of the degree of mechanization, the Heavy Machinery Factory timely organized and promoted the joint operation of production workers and maintenance workers. This is essentially a new development of the past "all-rounders." In the future, a large number of new things will emerge. While strengthening ideological work, we must also support the growth of more and more new things with high enthusiasm.

    With the in-depth development of the technological revolution movement, a series of changes have been caused in all aspects such as labor organization, technical management, and rules and regulations. While continuing to focus on consolidation, popularization, and improvement, we must adjust certain links of the relations of production and the superstructure in a timely and proactive manner, and continuously improve enterprise management to adapt to and promote the development of productive forces. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, improve the leadership level and the ideological level of the masses, and further boost revolutionary drive to strive for the perfect realization of a greater and better leap forward in 1960.

    沿着全民大闹技术革命的道路奋勇前进
    岳维藩代表谈太原市技术革新群众运动的体会主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理所作的报告。两年来连续大跃进的实践和目前广泛开展着的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，再一次证明了，只要我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社，就一定能够从胜利走向新的更大的胜利。太原市人民从去年12月份开始，就掀起了以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的高潮。几个月来，运动席卷全市，迅速地形成一个技术大革命、科学大跃进、生产大发展、思想大提高、文化大普及的宏伟局面。
    运动发展的趋势是，规模越来越壮阔，声势越来越浩大，真正成为全民性的伟大的革命运动。工业和交通部门的广大职工，都在热情沸腾地大搞革新。不仅生产部门创造出各式各样的机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化设备，日新月异地改变着技术面貌，而且在过去历次运动中不大活跃的职能科室，也空前热烈地大搞革新并取得很大的成就。如设计部门创造了计算图表化、绘图样板化等一系列新的设计方法，使计算、绘图、翻译、统计等所有的设计工作程序，摆脱了繁琐、重复的劳动。理化试验部门创造了碳硫自动测定仪，使定点、平衡、记录等十六个手工操作
  的工序，全部连续自动化。在工业交通部门的带动下，商业服务、财政金融、文化卫生一直到街道、公社也都卷入到运动中来。例如财会部门把多少年来“面对玻璃板，手打一二三”的老做法，改变为“点票不用手，传票自动走”。食堂、饭店不仅出现了蒸煮消毒蒸气化、手工操作机械化、烹炒烧烤煤气化，甚至有的单位连炸油条、打烧饼也都机械化了。全市各行各业都根据生产、工作发展的要求，从各个方面进行技术改革，真是丰富多彩，万紫千红。整个城市出现了“天天有革新，人人有创造，行行有奇迹”的动人景象。
    群众运动的广泛开展，使革新内容很快地由单项的一般的改革发展为整个企业、整个行业的系统改革，进而发展到全面地技术改造。全市锻造工人在不断进行单项革新的基础上，用二十天的时间，就结束了手工操作的历史，从锻打、翻料直到起重运输、炉门起落全部实现机械化。基本建设部门也由零星的革新，发展到机具配套成龙，使混凝土、钢筋、木作三大工种的各个工序，都采用先进机具，生产操作连续化。为了适应生产发展和技术改造的要求，许多工厂的厂内运输实现了地面轨道、空中索道的运输龙网化。全市搬运机械化半机械化程度已由原来的10％左右平均提高到65％，最高的达到95％左右。截至目前，全市工业、交通运输部门的机械化半机械化程度已由原来的42％提高到62.28％。在二千七百一十四个工种中，已有一千八百多个工种摆脱了手工操作和笨重体力劳动。许多企业在扩大机械化战果的同时，进一步发展到革新整个设备，改变整个作业线。棉毛织造厂原来是只有一把虎头钳、十二个手工业工人的手工业生产合作社，经过几年来不断的努力，机械化半机械化程度达到30％，而在这次“四化”运动中又迅速地提高到了84％。设备陈旧的太原烟草厂，经过技术改造，从原料投入到产品装箱入库，实现了机械化生产联动线，使机器定员减少三分之一到三分之二。生产周期缩短90％，年产能力提高一倍半。不仅基础较差的企业能够很快提高机械化程度，就是机械程度较高的企业，在解放思想之后，便可以向着更高的机械化和自动化的方向迈进。例如太原化工厂，在两个月内就使全厂主要车间实现了仪表化，有两个工段利用仪表自动测量、检查和调节生产过程，基本上成为“无人工段”。在电解车间，只要一个人操纵仪表，就能够控制底层二百八十台电解槽。全市已经涌现出二百四十条自动化半自动化生产线和联动线，增加了七百五十四台自动化半自动化单机。由于手工操作机械化，进而向着全盘机械化、自动化更高的目标发展，这就使工业生产能以更快的速度转移到新的技术基础上，用先进的设备和先进的操作方法来高速度地发展生产。
    随着运动的继续深入，广大职工更以百折不挠的精神，积极地采用新技术，大量试制高、大、精、尖、新产品，并结合科学研究，向着尖端技术进军。机械系统已在切削、清洗、焊接、探伤等方面采用了超声波技术，许多企业还采用了程序控制机床、行车遥控等新技术。随着攀登技术高峰而来的群众性的科学研究活动，也更加广泛地开展起来。许多较大的厂矿参加科学研究工作的职工，都在几百人以至千人以上。科学研究机关和高等院校还组织一千多人，同企业职工相结合进行科学研究。这就更加有力地促进了技术水平的提高。
    全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动的高速度发展和大面积丰收，推进了生产大跃进，实现了生产开门红。今年第一季度全市工业职工劳动生产率，比去年同期增长了72.6％；第一季度的工业总产值提前六天超额完成计划，比去年第四季度增长10.92％，平均日产水平提高22％，历年第一季度生产低于上年第四季度的“常规”已经翻过来了。从运动开展以来，已经节约了劳动力五万四千多个（等于全市职工总数的六分之一），提前三个月完成预定上半年节约四至五万劳动力的任务。全市人民正在满怀信心地为更快地提高机械化、自动化水平，为在工业产值成倍地增长、二百个新建扩建项目投入生产的情况下，节约更多的劳动力而奋斗。
    机械化、自动化程度的不断提高，不仅意味着社会财富的日益增长，而且也意味着创造单位产品所需的劳动量日益减少，大大改善了工人的劳动条件。当工人一旦摆脱落后工具而掌握机器的时候，就从内心里迸发出无限喜悦。锻造工人高兴的说：“过去是十冬腊月汗透衫，腰困腿疼胳膊酸；现在是站在一旁作手势，不烤不累又高产”。由于手工操作变为机械操作，广大职工迫切要求提高文化和技术，而在事实上已有可能拿出较多的时间从事文化、技术和政治理论的学习。许多企业的职工参加文化学习的到课率，由过去的60％左右上升到现在的90％以上。全市参加业余学习的职工占到职工总数的80％，其中参加业余大学的占到应入学人数的85％。晋西机器厂有十六名工人将在今年夏季学完业余大学的课程，成为第一批业余大学的毕业生。特别是有十三万多工人参加了毛主席著作的学习，这对提高职工思想觉悟，促进技术革命的发展，实现生产的持续跃进，都具有深远的意义。
    技术革命运动不仅改变着生产技术的落后面貌，而且深刻地改变着人们的精神面貌。破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干的共产主义风格进一步发扬起来。“两个茶缸闹革命”的故事，就是太原油漆厂的两个土专家和两个徒工在技术条件十分简陋的情况下，用两个搪瓷茶缸作为试验设备，经过多次试验，终于试验成功了醋酸甲脂等生产高级油漆所需要的化学原料。随着手工操作机械化的巨大变化，更加增强了工人阶级的集体主义思想和组织性、纪律性，进一步发展了人与人之间的团结协作、互相促进的新型关系。“三结合”的形式在厂内厂外更加普遍的运用起来，“学先进、赶先进、帮后进、抢困难、让方便”的新风尚和高尚的道德品质，正在日益发展起来。有些企业的职工创造了攻难关、破关键的“共产主义大协作劳动日”的形式，他们围绕生产关键和薄弱环节，利用公休时间进行群众性的互相支援，帮助后进单位出色地完成了革新技术和生产任务。思想觉悟的大提高，创造智慧的大发扬，形成一种伟大的力量，推动着技术革命更加有声有势地沿着正确的、科学的、全民的道路向前发展。
    在大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们在加强全面领导的同时，着重的抓了以下几个方面：
    第一，从市到厂矿、车间、工段、小组全面的制订规划，并且有步骤有准备的，组织若干次战役，分期实现。规划的制定，既以机械化、半机械化为中心，又和全面的技术改造相结合；既以突击薄弱环节为重点，又要全面开花；既抓一般革新，又抓尖端技术。事实证明，像技术革新和技术革命这样广泛的群众运动，包括改革操作工艺规程、改造设备、改善劳动组织以及原材料的综合利用等各个方面，只有围绕生产关键做好全面规划，才能更有领导更有组织的把整个技术工作和管理工作带动起来。在全面规划的指导下，有计划地组织几次战役，就可以既有长打算，又有短安排。我们已经相继取得了两次战役的胜利，并从3月1日开始展开了第三次战役。每次战役都有明确的主攻方向，集中优势兵力分期分批地加以实现。各个战役紧密衔接，上一个战役为下一个战役准备条件，下一个战役又为上一个战役扩大战果，从而保证运动后浪推前浪、一浪高一浪地向前发展。许多单位在组织战役中，还采取了定项目、定进度、定措施、定专人、定期检查的“五定”办法和分级负责的制度，即大项目由厂负责，中项目由车间负责，小项目由小组负责。这样做的结果，就使运动的发展既轰轰烈烈而又扎扎实实。
    第二，大搞群众运动，开展群众性的大练武、大比武、大表演，全面推广先进经验，并与比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛运动结合起来，使先进水平迅速成为社会生产水平。广大职工通过练武，掌握了新的技术，通过比武发现和选择最先进的技术和经验，使之成龙配套，又通过表演系统地推广了先进技术和经验。然后再练、再比、再表演，如此循环往复，不断提高，不断完善。参加这种竞赛的有个人、有集体、有师傅、有徒弟，有生产部门，也有职能科室，规模很大，战斗性很强。全市有80％以上的职工参加了练武比武。据五十二个单位统计，在三个月内参加比武表演的达到五十四万八千人（次），参加比武的项目达到一千零五十六种。通过这种比武表演，有八百余项经验取长补短配成套，使零星的、分散的革新经验，逐步达到系统、完整，形成“一条龙”。这种经验配套的过程是，既比武、又论文；既是集中、分析、研究、鉴定、革新的过程；又是先进经验普及和提高的过程；也是广泛宣传革新能手的先进思想的过程。第一机床厂通过比武，就有二分之一的工人达到工时定额的十五倍到二十五倍。在领导运动中，我们始终注意了抓两头带中间，先在先进单位召开现场会议，也在落后单位召开现场会议，促使先进的更加先进，落后的很快赶上先进，达到共同提高。
    第三，坚持土法生产和洋法生产相结合，自力更生和相互协作相结合的两条腿走路的方针。在整个运动中，我们从改造旧设备着手，并运用土办法制造简易设备，逐步由土到洋，由粗到精，不断提高，从而充分地调动起广大群众的积极性，并收到显著的效果。
    随着机械化程度的不断提高，我们预料到原材料问题必然会更加突出。面对这种情况，我们采取了企业内部“一条龙”用料，组织了企业与企业之间全市范围的原材料使用“一条龙”，并大力开展了各种原材料的综合利用。这三种形式互为条件，互相补充，不仅有效地克服了某些原材料不足的困难，并使资源得到充分的综合利用。全市钢材利用率已从去年的70％提高到80％到85％，先进的单位达到95％以上，木材、橡胶等利用率也都增长了10％到15％，并且出现了十五个无废料工厂。原材料使用“一条龙”和综合利用已经成为技术革命的一个重要方面，并且促进了运动的发展。
    第四，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，这是整个运动顺利发展的根本保证。党的领导的首要一环是加强思想领导，以不断革命的无产阶级世界观教育群众解放思想，破除迷信，树立雄心壮志，经常鼓起革命干劲。事实证明，要从物质技术上进一步武装企业，首先必须用革命的思想把职工武装起来。“技术大革新，思想打先锋”，只有思想不断跃进，技术才能不断提高。同时要注意发现和积极支持新生事物的成长，一露苗头就狠狠地抓。重型机器厂根据机械化程度提高的新情况，及时组织和推广了生产工和检修工的联合作业。这实质上是过去“多面手”的新发展。今后新生事物将会大量出现，我们在加强思想工作的同时，还必须以高度的热情支持越来越多的新生事物的成长。
    随着技术革命运动的深入发展，已经在劳动组织、技术管理、规章制度等各个方面引起一系列的变化。我们要在继续抓好巩固、普及、提高的同时，及时主动地对生产关系和上层建筑的某些环节加以调整，不断地改进企业管理工作，以适应和促进生产力的发展。我们一定要认真地学习毛主席的著作，提高领导水平和群众的思想水平，更大地鼓起革命干劲，为完满地实现1960年更大更好的跃进而奋斗。
