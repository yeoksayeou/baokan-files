We fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. Our country's socialist construction has completed the original major targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years. This is a great victory achieved by the people of all nationalities in our country under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and giving full play to their enthusiasm for building socialism.

In the continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction and the socialist revolution over the past two years, the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, under the leadership and cultivation of party committees and governments at all levels, have, together with the people of the whole country, continuously adhered to self-ideological revolution, brought into play soaring energy, and established many red flags of leading the leap forward on all fronts of the people's commune, the nationwide industrial development, the large-scale agricultural high-yield movement, supporting the front lines, and the construction of commerce, transportation, culture, education, and health. More and more advanced deeds and model figures have emerged. In 1959, 234 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Fujian Province were named provincial-level advanced producers and advanced workers. The returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese on the Fujian front line not only actively participated in production and construction but also produced many heroic model figures in supporting the front line in the struggle against the enemy. For example, the famous Xiamen "Ten Sisters," "Seven Aunts," "Mu Guiying Class," "Ten Militiamen," and other red flag collectives supporting the front all have relatives of overseas Chinese. Among the 350 people in Jinjiang County's Jinjing Township who were praised and rewarded by the People's Liberation Army for their combat support work, 109 were returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. They are all red flags among the countless red flags in Fujian Province. Countless moving advanced deeds have also emerged among returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province. For example, in the early rice production in Taishan County in 1959, 9,153 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese planted 7,169 mu of large-area high-yield rice experimental fields, with an average yield of 545 jin per mu in one season. In Puning County, 872 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese were named advanced workers and labor models. In 1959, a total of 373 advanced and model figures of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese attended national advanced worker meetings, such as the National Hero Conference, and received awards at the Fourth Enlarged Plenary Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. These are examples of how the red flags of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese are increasing under the glorious light of the General Line.

Many returned overseas Chinese only returned to the motherland from capitalist countries not long ago. The vast majority of them, whether abroad or back in China, are engaged in labor, but their experiences are vastly different. When they were abroad, they lived in poverty and had few opportunities to learn culture. Even if they had a skill, they could not use it and were often threatened by unemployment. However, after they returned to the motherland, under the cultivation and education of the Party, they not only removed the label of illiteracy, but their cultural and technical level was constantly improving. Their lives are not only guaranteed, but also constantly improving. Therefore, the returned overseas Chinese workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises, inspired by the Party's General Line, can give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, and constantly emerge advanced deeds and advanced figures in labor production. For example, all eleven returned overseas Chinese workers and staff in the Tianjin North China Sewing Machine Factory are advanced producers and advanced workers. Sixteen of the seventeen returned overseas Chinese workers and staff in the Changchun First Automobile Factory have become advanced workers. For example, Xu Jianxiang, a worker at the Beijing State-owned Wireless Electrical Equipment Factory, learned culture and technology after returning to China from Indonesia, and his enthusiasm and creativity were brought into play. Therefore, he successfully improved the porcelain support rod processing die, which increased production efficiency by nine times. When processing permanent magnets for hydroelectric generators, he created a new record of 1,300 pieces per shift, which was 40% higher than the general production situation. When processing magnetic shafts, he also created a new record of doubling efficiency. Recalling his past situation abroad, Xu Jianxiang said with emotion: "I used to be a poor wretch despised by others, living a life of slavery like a beast of burden abroad. After returning to China, under the care of the Party and the government, I learned technology, improved my culture, and established a happy and beautiful family. I sincerely thank the Party for its deep kindness to me." Xu Jianxiang's words express the feelings of many returned overseas Chinese workers.

From the above examples, it can be seen that only under the socialist system where the people are masters of their own affairs can people's energy and talents be fully utilized, laborers are respected by the people, and their material and cultural life is most reliably guaranteed. Their labor is for the entire society and also for themselves, and personal interests are combined with the interests of socialism. They are all for socialism and do not haggle over personal rewards. At the same time, in terms of social and political life, under our socialist system, the people enjoy full democracy, and various relations within the people are constantly and promptly adjusted, so everyone is full of energy and strives to be upstream. It can be seen that in our country, red flag bearers are everywhere, which is very natural.

We also realize from many facts that the advanced deeds of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese are the result of putting politics in command and improving ideology. They constantly transform their own thinking and are determined to devote themselves to the cause of socialist construction, so they can make achievements for the country. Following the socialist revolution in politics and ideology in 1957, the Party called on the people of the whole country to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and bring into play the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Last year, the Party called for opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting energy, and launching a production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. Under these calls of the Party, returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, like the people of the whole country, have been deeply educated in the process of socialist revolution. Many returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese laboring people have greatly improved their ideological awareness under the education and encouragement of socialist revolution and socialist construction, consciously carried out self-transformation, took the same steps as the working people of the whole country, set high aspirations, and were determined to be masters of nature and masters of science and technology. They worked hard, practically, and cleverly in the cause of socialist construction, striving to take the lead in the leap forward, creating advanced deeds, and producing many red flag bearers.

Among the returned overseas Chinese workers, a small number of people were once uneasy about their work when they first returned to China. After patient education by the Party and the masses, they improved their ideological understanding and brought into play their enthusiasm in production, boldly creating and bravely innovating. Some of them finally became advanced figures. For example, Chen Liangwen, a car driver at the Shanxi Yinying Coal Mine, and seven other returned overseas Chinese were uneasy about their work when they first returned to China, but after they improved their ideological understanding, they all actively improved production and made remarkable achievements in safe production and technological innovation. The transportation tasks they completed in 1959 were three times those of 1957. In technological innovation, the entire team put forward 43 rationalization proposals, of which 12 have been implemented, saving the state 45,182 yuan. Therefore, they were all named advanced producers. The path taken by these returned overseas Chinese workers is the path pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong. As Chairman Mao said: "The working class must transform the entire society in the class struggle and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time, it must also transform itself. The working class must constantly learn in its work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and can never stop."

Among the relatives of overseas Chinese, there are also many similar examples. For example, Xu Shunhua, a relative of overseas Chinese who attended the Fourth Enlarged Plenary Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in 1959, used to dislike labor and yearn for overseas capitalist life. Later, with the help and education of the Party and the masses, her thinking changed. She was greatly encouraged by the Great Leap Forward in the cause of socialist construction. She realized that it was meaningless to live a comfortable life without labor, so she actively participated in labor production. As the production team leader of the people's commune, she led more than 100 women to carry out a large-scale manure accumulation movement, and also led 18 women to carry out experimental fields, resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and finally achieved a particularly large harvest of 1,117.5 jin per mu of rice. The masses wrote poems praising her, saying: "Young girls used to hide in boudoirs, today's women compete with Mulan, celestial fairies are hard to compare, and there is no end to the stories of human heroes." From the process of Xu Shunhua's ideological transformation, it can be seen that the red flag bearers among the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese are because they listen to the Party, act in accordance with the Party's line and policies, and actively participate in the Great Leap Forward movement in production, so they can turn backwardness into advancement, give full play to their talents and create moving advanced deeds.

Similarly, among the returned overseas Chinese intellectuals, many people have also consciously carried out self-ideological revolution under the education and help of the Party and the masses, and finally become advanced figures in the scientific and technological circles. For example, Su Hongxi, an associate professor of thoracic surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Xi'an Military Medical University, is a returned overseas Chinese from the United States. In the early days of his work, because he had more personal plans, his work could not be done well. After political study and the experience of labor practice, his understanding improved, and he was determined to transform himself, establish the idea of serving socialism, and become a promoter. In his scientific research work in medicine, he actively led the experiment of the clinical application of "extracorporeal circulation" (artificial heart-lung) and achieved success. Su Hongxi's achievement is, as he himself said: "The leadership of the Party is the source of strength and the fundamental guarantee for the development of science." Su Hongxi's spirit of self-ideological revolution is worthy of study by returned overseas Chinese intellectuals.

What should be especially mentioned in the ideological leap forward of the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese is the growing communist style. For example, Lin Shaodong, a returned overseas Chinese doctor at Hengyang Hospital in Hunan Province, dedicated his own skin to save Yang Hanlin, a steel warrior who was 80% burned by radiant heat, during the nationwide steelmaking campaign in 1958. He transplanted it to the patient and took care of the patient day and night. With his efforts and the efforts of the entire hospital staff, Yang Hanlin was finally rescued from the brink of death. There are many such deeds of selflessness among the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. This is truly a situation where one difficulty is supported by all, and one person has an accident, and thousands of people help each other. Every red heart is connected by a red line of building socialism.

The above examples fully prove what Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "The people are the creators of history, the most active factor of the productive forces. The people are liberated from the old society and become masters under the socialist system, so they can give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and make production and construction develop at a high speed."

Now, the rural people's communes and urban people's communes in various places are vigorously running public canteens, which bring endless benefits to the broad masses of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese. With public canteens, women are freed from tedious housework and participate in labor production and social activities, which not only improves their political and ideological awareness, but also increases the wealth of the country and the income of the family. At the same time, as women participate in labor production and various collective welfare undertakings, people's lives are properly arranged, and they can wholeheartedly participate in socialist construction. Everyone is in a good mood and full of spirit, and the families of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese are more harmonious and happy. Therefore, since the communization, the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, especially women, wholeheartedly support collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens. At present, many returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in cities are also consciously and voluntarily joining with street residents to run factories, run public canteens, and set up life service stations, actively participating in social production and actively participating in collective life. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese will surely make greater achievements in this mass movement that changes the face of urban and rural areas.

At the same time, we must also realize that building socialism in our country is a long-term and arduous task. The Party calls on the people of the whole country to adhere to the spirit of continuous revolution and transform their own subjective world and the objective world. Now, the whole country is vigorously carrying out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and advanced figures are emerging like mushrooms after a rain. The socialist cause is developing rapidly, and constantly puts forward higher and newer requirements for us. What is advanced today will be even more advanced tomorrow. The technological revolution is endless. You cannot be satisfied with today's achievements. If you are satisfied with today's achievements, you cannot move forward. Our responsibility is to hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, arm ourselves with the spirit of continuous revolution, work hard to learn technology and culture, work hard to study Mao Zedong's works, improve our level of understanding and cultural and technical level, actively participate in the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, work hard, boldly create, and create more advanced deeds in production and work, and insist on leaping forward and leaping forward again.

We must also see that due to the anti-Chinese activities in some countries in Southeast Asia, a large number of overseas Chinese will continue to return to China to participate in socialist construction. We, the people in the country, especially the overseas Chinese relatives in various places and the returned overseas Chinese who have lived in the country for a long time, have a glorious task, which is to use our own model actions and advanced thinking, our own life experience under the socialist system, the experience of labor practice, and our own learning experience to help the newly returned overseas Chinese gradually get used to the domestic life, highly promote their patriotic traditions, work hard to learn production skills, improve their ideological awareness, and actively participate in the new upsurge of the socialist continued Great Leap Forward.

    归国华侨和华侨眷属高举三面红旗继续前进
    连贯、陈其瑗、洪丝丝、庄明理、苏惠代表和李华、方君壮、卢成、严希纯、陈书乐、伍觉天、许志猛、刘成鹏、卢心远委员的联合发言
    我们完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理的报告。我们国家的社会主义建设，在两年的时间内，完成了第二个五年计划的原定主要指标。这是我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大红旗，充分发挥建设社会主义的积极性所取得的伟大胜利。
    广大归国华侨和华侨眷属在两年多来的社会主义建设连续大跃进和社会主义革命运动中，在各级党政的领导和培养教育下，和全国人民一道，不断坚持自我思想革命，发挥冲天干劲，在人民公社化、全民办工业、农业大面积丰产运动、支援前线，以及商业、交通运输和文教卫生各个建设战线上，树立起许许多多跃进居先的红旗，出现了越来越多的先进事迹和模范人物。1959年，福建省的归侨侨眷被评为省级先进生产者和先进工作者的就有二百三十四人。福建前线的归侨侨眷，不但积极参加生产建设，还在支援前线的对敌斗争中涌现出许多英雄模范人物。例如有名的厦门“十姐妹”、“七大娘”、“穆桂英班”、“十民兵”等支前的红旗集体中，都有华侨的亲属。晋江县金井乡因支前战斗受到人民解放军表扬和奖励的三百五十人中，归侨侨眷就占了一百零九名。他们都是福建全省无数红旗当中的红旗。广东省归侨侨眷中也出现无数动人的先进事迹，如台山县1959年早造生产中，归侨侨眷九千一百五十三人种大面积水稻丰产试验田七千一百六十九亩，平均一造亩产达到五百四十五斤。普宁县归侨侨眷被评为先进工作者和劳动模范的就有八百七十二人。在1959年，出席群英会等全国性的先进分子会议，和在全国侨联一届四次委员扩大会议上受奖的归侨侨眷先进、模范人物，共有三百七十三人。这些就是在总路线的光辉照耀下，归侨侨眷的红旗越树越多的事例。
    许多归侨在不久之前，才从资本主义国家回到祖国来，他们中的绝大多数人，无论在国外或是回到国内，都从事劳动，可是他们的遭遇却有天渊之别。他们在国外的时候，生活穷苦，很少有机会学习文化，就是有了一手本领，也不能得到发挥，甚至经常受到失业的威胁。可是，当他们回到祖国以后，在党的培养教育下，不仅摘掉了文盲的帽子，而且文化技术水平在不断提高；生活不仅有保证，而且不断在改善；所以工矿企业中的归侨职工在党的总路线的鼓舞下，能够同国内职工一样，以主人翁的态度，充分发挥积极性和创造性，在劳动生产中不断出现先进事迹和先进人物。如天津市华北缝纫机制造厂的十一个归侨职工，都是先进生产者和先进工作者。长春第一汽车厂的十七个归侨职工，有十六个成为先进工作者。又如北京国营无线电器材厂工人许建祥，从印度尼西亚回国以后，学了文化和技术，积极性和创造性得到发挥。所以，他成功地改进了瓷支杆加工胎具，使生产效率提高了九倍；在加工水力发电机的恒磁时，创造了个人班产一千三百块的新纪录，比一般生产情况提高了40％；在加工磁轴时，他也创造了提高效率两倍的新纪录。许建祥回忆起过去在国外的情况时感慨地说：“我原是一个给人家看不起的穷光蛋，在国外过着牛马般的奴隶生活。回国以后，在党和政府的关怀下，学会了技术，提高了文化，又建立了美好幸福的家庭。我衷心感谢党对我的深厚恩情。”许建祥这番话，表达了许多归侨工人的心情。
    从上述的事例可以看出，只有在人民当家作主的社会主义制度下，人的精力和才智，才能得到充分发挥，劳动者受到人们的崇敬，他们的物质文化生活得到最可靠的保证。他们的劳动是为了整个社会，也是为了自己，个人利益同社会主义的利益结合在一起。他们一切为了社会主义，不是斤斤计较个人的报酬。同时，在社会政治生活方面，在我们社会主义制度下，人民享有充分的民主，人民内部的各种关系得到不断的及时的调整，所以人人鼓足干劲，个个力争上游。由此可见，在我们这样的国家里，红旗手遍地皆是，这是很自然的事情。
    我们还从许多事实认识到，归侨侨眷的先进事迹是政治挂帅和思想提高的结果。他们不断改造自己的思想，决心献身于社会主义建设事业，就能为国家作出成绩。继1957年的政治上和思想上的社会主义革命之后，党号召全国人民破除迷信，解放思想，发挥敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格；去年党又号召反右倾、鼓干劲，开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。在党的这些号召下，归侨侨眷和全国人民一样，在社会主义革命过程中，受到了深刻的教育。许多归侨侨眷劳动人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的教育鼓舞下，思想觉悟大大提高，自觉地进行自我改造，同全国劳动人民同一步伐，树雄心，立大志，做大自然的主人，做科学技术的主人，在社会主义建设事业中苦干、实干、巧干，力争跃进居先，创造先进事迹，出现了许多红旗手。
    在归侨职工中有一小部分人，回国初时，曾一度不安心工作，经过党和群众的耐心教育，提高了思想认识，在生产中发挥了积极性，大胆创造，勇于革新，有些人终于成为先进人物。如山西阴营煤矿汽车司机陈亮文等七个归侨，回国初时就曾不安心工作，但当他们提高思想认识以后，就都积极搞好生产，在安全生产和技术革新上做出显著成绩。他们在1959年完成的运输任务，为1957年的三倍；在技术革新中，全组提出合理化建议四十三条，已经实现的十二条，就为国家节约了四万五千一百八十二元。所以他们都被评为先进生产者。这些归侨工人所走的道路就是毛泽东主席所指引的道路，正如毛主席说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也要改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”
    在侨眷中，也有很多类似的事例，如曾出席1959年全国侨联一届四次委员扩大会议的侨眷许舜华，过去厌恶劳动，向往国外资本主义生活。后来在党和群众的帮助教育下，思想有了转变，在社会主义建设事业大跃进中，又受到很大的鼓舞，她认识到不劳动而过着安逸生活太没有意义，便积极参加了劳动生产。她是人民公社的生产大队长，带动一百多个妇女大搞积肥运动，还带领十八个妇女大搞试验田，坚决执行农业“八字宪法”，终于获得水稻亩产一千一百一十七点五斤的特大丰收。群众写诗称赞她说：“早年姑娘藏闺房，今世妇女赛木兰，天上仙姬难比拟，人间英雄说不完。”从许舜华的思想转变过程就可以看出，归侨侨眷中的红旗手，就是因为他们听党的话，按照党的路线、政策办事，积极投入生产大跃进运动，所以能变落后为先进，充分发挥才智，创造出动人的先进事迹。
    同样，在归侨知识分子中，有许多人也在党和群众的教育帮助下，自觉进行自我思想革命，终于成为科学技术界的先进人物。如西安军医大学附属第一医院胸外科副教授苏鸿熙，是美国归侨，在参加工作初期，因为个人打算比较多，以致工作不能做得很好。经过政治学习和劳动实践的体会，认识提高了，他决心改造自己，树立为社会主义服务的思想，成为促进派。他在医学的科学研究工作中，积极领导“体外循环”（人工心肺）临床应用的试验，获得成功。苏鸿熙所以有这种成就，正如他自己所说：“党的领导是力量的源泉，是科学获得发展的根本保证。”苏鸿熙这种自我思想革命的精神，是值得归侨知识分子学习的。
    广大归侨侨眷思想跃进中，应该特别提到的是共产主义风格的日益成长。如在湖南省衡阳医院的归侨医士林绍东，在1958年全民大炼钢铁时为抢救全身被幅射热烫伤了80％的钢铁战士杨翰林，献出了自己的皮肤，移植到病人的身上，并且日夜护理病人。在他和全院人员的努力下，终于把杨翰林从死亡的边缘挽救过来。在归侨侨眷中，这种舍己为人的事迹是很多的。这真是一处困难，各方支援，一人有事，万人相助；颗颗红心被建设社会主义的红线串连在一起。
    以上事例充分证明李富春副总理所说的：“人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素，人民群众从旧社会解放出来，在社会主义制度下成为主人，就能够充分发挥积极性和创造性，使生产建设得到高速度的发展。”
    现在，各地农村人民公社和城市人民公社正在大办公共食堂，给广大侨眷归侨带来说不尽的好处。有了公共食堂，妇女们摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，参加劳动生产和社会活动，不仅提高了政治思想觉悟，也增加了国家的财富和家庭的收入。同时，由于家庭妇女参加了劳动生产和各种集体福利事业，又使得群众的生活得到适当安排，可以一心一意参加社会主义建设，人人心情舒畅，意气风发，归侨侨眷的家庭也更加和睦、幸福。所以，公社化以来，广大归侨侨眷，特别是妇女衷心拥护公共食堂等集体福利事业。目前，许多城市的归侨侨眷也都自觉自愿地同街道居民一起，大办工厂，大搞公共食堂，大兴生活服务站，积极参加社会生产，积极参加集体生活。我们相信，归侨侨眷在党的领导下，在这场改变城乡面貌的群众运动中，一定能作出更大的成绩。
    同时，我们也必须认识到，我国建设社会主义是个长期的艰巨的任务，党号召全国人民坚持不断革命的精神，改造自己的主观世界，改造客观世界。现在全国正轰轰烈烈地开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，先进人物如雨后春笋般产生。社会主义事业迅速发展，不断对我们提出更高更新的要求，今天出现先进的东西，明天会出现更先进的东西。技术革命是无止境的，你们不能满足于今天的成就，满足于现在的成就，就不能前进。我们的责任，就是高举不断革命的红旗，以不断革命的精神武装自己，努力学习技术和文化，努力学习毛泽东的著作，提高自己的认识水平和文化技术水平，积极投入技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中去，刻苦钻研，大胆创造，才能在生产中和工作中创造出更先进的事迹，坚持跃进再跃进。
    我们还必须看到，由于东南亚有的国家的排华活动，今后还陆续有大批华侨回国参加社会主义建设。我们在国内的人民，特别是各地侨眷和在国内生活较久的归侨，都有一个光荣的任务，就是以自己的模范行动和先进思想，以自己在社会主义制度下的生活经验，对劳动实践的体会，自己的学习心得，帮助新归国的华侨，逐步习惯国内的生活，高度发扬他们的爱国传统，努力学习生产技能，提高思想觉悟，积极投入社会主义继续大跃进的新高潮。
