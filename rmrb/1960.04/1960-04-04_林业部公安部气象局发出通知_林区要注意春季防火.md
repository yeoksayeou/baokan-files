The Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Central Meteorological Bureau recently jointly issued a notice to all regions to strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work.

The notice stated that since last winter, there has been little rain and snow, and the climate is dry, making it easy for forest fires to occur. Local forestry, public security, and meteorological departments should list forest protection and fire prevention as important work, closely coordinate and collaborate, and arrange inspections at all levels. It is necessary to intensify publicity and education on forest protection and fire prevention for residents in forest areas, and establish and improve fire prevention organizations. Since forest areas bordering provinces and counties are easily overlooked, all regions should, in addition to taking overall consideration, focus on weak links in strengthening forest protection and fire prevention work. At present, special attention should be paid to joint prevention work in border areas. Local meteorological and forestry departments should cooperate with each other to actively strengthen weather forecasts for forest fire hazards. Provinces (autonomous regions) that have not yet carried out this work should gradually do so in 1960. In addition, local forestry, public security, and meteorological departments should maintain regular contact, exchange information on forest protection, fire prevention and meteorological work, promptly organize joint inspections, summarize experiences and lessons, and promote forest protection and fire prevention work.

Xinhua News Agency reports: In order to encourage the vast number of workers and people's commune members on the forestry front to seize the "quarterly red" and "full house red" in forestry production in 1960, the Ministry of Forestry recently rewarded 304 advanced units and advanced producers who achieved remarkable results in afforestation, timber production and technical innovation in 1959. Among the advanced units that were rewarded, there are counties, people's communes, forestry bureaus, forest farms, factories, railway bureaus, schools, etc., and there are thirty-eight advanced producers who won awards.

    林业部公安部气象局发出通知
    林区要注意春季防火
    新华社讯　林业部、公安部、中央气象局最近联合通知各地加强护林防火工作。
    通知说，去冬以来雨雪较少，气候干旱，容易发生森林火灾。各地林业、公安和气象部门，应当把护林防火列为重要工作，密切配合协作，层层布置检查，要对林区居民抓紧进行护林防火的宣传教育工作，建立和健全防火组织。由于省、县交界的林区容易被忽视，各地在加强护林防火工作中，除全面兼顾外，要大抓薄弱环节，当前要特别注意抓好交界地区的联防工作。各地气象和林业部门应互相配合，积极加强森林火灾危险天气预报。尚未开展这一工作的省（区），应在1960年内逐渐开展。此外，各地林业、公安和气象部门，还应当经常联系，互通护林防火和气象工作情报，及时组织联合检查，总结经验教训，推动护林防火工作。
    据新华社讯　为了鼓励林业战线上广大职工和人民公社社员，夺取1960年林业生产“季季红”、“满堂红”，林业部最近奖励了1959年在造林、木材生产和技术革新等方面取得显著成绩的先进单位和先进生产者三百零四个。受到奖励的先进单位中，有县、人民公社、林业局、林场、工厂、铁路局、学校等，得奖的先进生产者有三十八人。
