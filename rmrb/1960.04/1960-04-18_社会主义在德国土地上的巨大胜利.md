    The Great Victory of Socialism on German Soil
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    An inspiring piece of news has arrived from the east bank of the Elbe River: all fourteen districts of the German Democratic Republic have now achieved agricultural collectivization. From March 5th, when Rostock District became the first collectivized district, to April 14th, when Karl-Marx-Stadt District became the last, it took only a little over a month. In this short period, earth-shaking changes have taken place in the rural areas of the German Democratic Republic. Farmers across the country have cast off the shackles of old ideas and habits and have taken great strides on the road to socialist collective economy.

    The rapid realization of agricultural collectivization in the German Democratic Republic is a great victory for socialism on German soil. The achievement of this victory is primarily due to the tremendous work carried out by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the socialist transformation of agriculture. Since 1952, the German Democratic Republic has launched a large-scale agricultural collectivization movement. After the 33rd Central Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in October 1957, the leadership over agricultural collectivization was strengthened. The Party's Fifth Congress in July 1958 further emphasized the use of all forces to help farmers carry out the socialist transformation of the countryside, which led to significant progress in the agricultural collectivization movement. At the end of 1957, there were 6,691 agricultural production cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic with more than 229,000 members; by the end of 1958, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had increased to 9,637 (an increase of 2,946 in 1958 alone), and the number of members had increased to 353,000. By December 1959, the cultivated area of agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 43.5% of the total cultivated area of the German Democratic Republic. Including the cultivated area of state-owned farms, the cultivated area of socialist components accounted for 52% of the country's total cultivated area. Especially after the Seventh Central Plenary Session of the Party last December, a large number of Party and government workers went deep into the countryside, on the one hand, helping cooperatives organize production, and on the other hand, vigorously publicizing agricultural collectivization, laying the foundation for the rapid development of the agricultural collectivization movement. The superiority of agricultural collectivization also attracted more and more individual farmers to the socialist collective economy. All these have brought the agricultural collectivization of the German Democratic Republic to the point of natural completion.

    The German Democratic Republic is a highly industrialized country. The smooth realization of agricultural collectivization will undoubtedly promote the accelerated development of agricultural production, thereby accelerating the process of overcoming the lag of agricultural production behind industrial production. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which was held not long ago, called on the people of the whole country to contribute all their strength to promote the straight-line rise of agricultural production and labor productivity. The seven-year plan (1959-1965) for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic stipulates that by 1965, the total agricultural output will increase by 36% compared with 1958. Undoubtedly, the complete realization of agricultural collectivization will play an important role in completing this great task.

    The great victory of socialism on German soil not only demonstrates that the socialist agriculture of the German Democratic Republic is incomparably superior to the capitalist agriculture of West Germany, but also severely undermines the conspiracy of US imperialism and the West German reactionaries to sabotage the German Democratic Republic. US imperialism and West German reactionaries have never given up their dream: that one day, capitalism will be restored in the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries in Eastern Europe. They have not only not completely abandoned the conspiracy of external intervention by force, but also pinned their hopes on the so-called "evolution" within socialist countries. The smooth completion of agricultural collectivization in the German Democratic Republic proves that the socialist system on the east bank of the Elbe River is becoming more and more consolidated, and the illusions of imperialism and West German reactionaries are even more impossible to realize.

    The realization of agricultural collectivization in the German Democratic Republic is not only a victory of great historical significance for the people of the German Democratic Republic, but also a further enhancement of the strength of the entire socialist camp. We warmly hail this brilliant achievement of the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic.

    社会主义在德国土地上的巨大胜利
    本报评论员
    一个令人欢欣鼓舞的消息从易北河东岸传来：德意志民主共和国全国十四个专区，已经全部实现了农业合作化。从今年3月5日罗斯托克专区成为第一个合作化专区，到4月14日卡尔·马克思斯塔特专区成为最后一个专区，仅仅花了一个多月的时间。在这短短的一段时期里，德意志民主共和国农村中起了翻天复地的变化，全国农民摆脱了旧的思想束缚和生活习惯，大踏步地走上了社会主义集体经济的道路。
    德意志民主共和国农业合作化的迅速实现，是社会主义在德国土地上的巨大胜利。而这一胜利的取得，首先是因为德国统一社会党在农业社会主义改造方面进行了巨大的工作。从1952年起，德意志民主共和国就开始大规模展开了农业合作化运动。德国统一社会党从1957年10月第三十三次中央全会以后，加强了对于农业合作化的领导，1958年7月党的第五次代表大会，更加强调了用一切力量帮助农民进行农村的社会主义改造，使农业合作化运动有了显著的进展。1957年底，德意志民主共和国有六千六百九十一个农业生产合作社，社员有二十二万九千多人；到1958年底，农业生产合作社的数目已增加到九千六百三十七个（即在1958年一年内增加了二千九百四十六个），社员的数目已增加到三十五万三千人。到1959年12月，全国农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占德意志民主共和国耕地总面积的43.5％，把国营农场耕地面积计算在内，社会主义成分的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的52％。特别是去年12月党的第七次中央全会以后，大批党和政府的工作人员深入农村，一面帮助合作社组织生产，一面大力宣传农业合作化，为农业合作化运动的迅速发展打下了基础。而农业合作化的优越性也把越来越多的个体农民吸引到社会主义集体经济方面来。所有这些，都使德意志民主共和国的农业合作化达到了水到渠成、瓜熟蒂落的程度。
    德意志民主共和国是工业高度发达的国家，全国农业合作化的顺利实现，无疑地将促进农业生产的加速发展，从而加速克服农业生产落后于工业生产的过程。不久前召开的德国统一社会党八中全会决议，号召全国人民贡献一切力量，以促进农业生产和劳动生产率的直线上升。德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划（1959—1965年）规定，到1965年，农业总产量将要比1958年增长36％。无疑地，农业合作化的全部实现，将在完成这一巨大任务方面发挥重要的作用。
    社会主义在德国土地上的巨大胜利，不仅显示了德意志民主共和国的社会主义农业比西德的资本主义农业具有无比的优越性，而且沉重地打击了美帝国主义和西德反动派破坏德意志民主共和国的阴谋。美帝国主义和西德反动派，一直没有放弃过它们的梦想：有朝一日，资本主义会在德意志民主共和国和东欧其他社会主义国家中复辟。它们不仅没有完全放弃用武力来进行外部干涉的阴谋，而且还把希望寄托在所谓社会主义国家内部的“演变”上。德意志民主共和国农业合作化的顺利完成，证明了社会主义制度在易北河东岸已愈来愈加巩固，帝国主义和西德反动派的迷梦更加不可能实现。
    德意志民主共和国实现农业合作化，不仅是德意志民主共和国人民伟大历史意义的胜利，同时也是进一步增强整个社会主义阵营的力量。我们热烈欢呼兄弟的德意志民主共和国人民的这一辉煌的成就。
