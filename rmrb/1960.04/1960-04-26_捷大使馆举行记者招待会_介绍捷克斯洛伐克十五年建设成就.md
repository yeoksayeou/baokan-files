Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: On May 9th, the Czechoslovak Embassy in China held a press conference this afternoon to introduce Czechoslovakia's brilliant achievements and the grand Third Five-Year Plan in the past fifteen years since the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army. Štefan Rajki, Counselor of the Embassy, said at the press conference that in the short span of fifteen years, Czechoslovakia has eradicated the capitalist system, laid the foundation for socialism, and will complete socialist construction in the near future. This is due to the creative activities of the working people under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and also because Czechoslovakia firmly stands within the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. When he talked about the Third Five-Year Plan from 1961 to 1965, he said that by 1965, industrial production will increase by at least half compared to 1960, and the total agricultural output will increase by 40% compared to 1957. All of this requires closer and more comprehensive cooperation with China and other socialist countries. In the past few years, the economic cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China has developed greatly and is developing continuously and successfully. He pointed out that this fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance is not only beneficial to the development of our two countries, but is also consistent with the interests of the entire socialist camp.
    Chen Yige, the press attache of the embassy, then introduced in detail the brilliant achievements made by Czechoslovakia in the past fifteen years.

    捷大使馆举行记者招待会
    介绍捷克斯洛伐克十五年建设成就
    据新华社25日讯　5月9日是苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克十五周年，捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使馆今天下午举行记者招待会，介绍了捷克斯洛伐克十五年来所取得的辉煌成就和宏伟的第三个五年计划。大使馆参赞石杰基那在招待会上说，捷克斯洛伐克在这短短的十五年中，铲除了资本主义制度，奠定了社会主义基础，并且要在最近时期内完成社会主义建设。这是由于有捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导着劳动人民进行了创造性的活动，也由于捷克斯洛伐克坚定不移地站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营内。他谈到1961年到1965年的第三个五年计划时说，到1965年，工业生产比1960年至少将增长一半，农业总产量将较1957年提高40％。这一切都要求与中国以及其他社会主义国家更紧密、更全面的合作。在过去几年中，捷中两国的经济合作有了很大发展，而且正在不断地、成功地发展着。他指出，这种兄弟般的合作和互助不仅有利于我们两国的发展，并且和整个社会主义阵营的利益也是一致的。
    大使馆新闻专员陈以阁接着详细地介绍了捷克斯洛伐克十五年来所取得的辉煌成就。
