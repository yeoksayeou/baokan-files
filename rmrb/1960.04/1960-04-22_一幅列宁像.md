    A Portrait of Lenin
    The picture on the left is a red flag embroidered with a portrait of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin. This historically significant red flag was embroidered by silk weaving workers in Guangzhou, China, and presented to their Soviet worker brothers in 1924 when Comrade Lenin passed away. This red flag, along with the flags of the Paris Commune members and the international workers' revolutionary movement, is now treasured in the Lenin Museum in Moscow.
    The words on the red flag are:
    "Respectfully presented to Soviet Comrades
    Before the new loss of our leader, let us unite our ranks even more quickly. Struggle for the liberation of the world's oppressed nations and toiling masses.
    Presented with respect by the colleagues of the Guangdong Jinlun Weaving Industry Federation of China"
    This red flag once again demonstrates that the Chinese working class, from the moment it stepped onto the historical stage, has unswervingly advanced along the bright road pointed out by Lenin.

    一幅列宁像
    左面这幅图，是一面绣着伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁像的红旗。这面有历史意义的红旗，是1924年列宁同志逝世的时候，我国广州的丝织工人绣了送给苏联工人弟兄的。这面红旗现在和巴黎公社社员的旗帜，国际工人革命运动的旗帜一起，珍藏在莫斯科列宁博物馆里。
    红旗上面的字是：
    “苏俄工友惠存
    赶紧在我们底首领新丧之前，把我们底队伍更加团结。为全世界被压迫的民族与劳苦的群众底解放而奋斗。
    中国广东锦纶织造工业联合会同人敬赠”
    这幅红旗，又一次表明了中国工人阶级从走上历史舞台的时候起，就坚定不移地沿着列宁所指出的光明大道前进。
