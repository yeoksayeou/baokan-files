Eradicating Diseases Outside Hospital Doors
Tianjin Launches Citywide Health Survey

(Our report) Tianjin medical personnel and the broad masses have launched a citywide health survey centered on eliminating pests and diseases. According to statistics from six districts, the health conditions of 2.8 million people have been surveyed.

In order to continuously improve the health level of the people, the broad medical personnel in Tianjin put forward the battle slogan of "We will not rest until we eliminate diseases." 95% of the city's medical personnel have left the hospitals and gone deep into factories, streets, and other collective living units to conduct health surveys and actively prevent and treat diseases. Hospitals and outpatient departments at all levels have made appropriate arrangements for daily outpatient and inpatient medical care, and have drawn a large number of medical personnel to be specifically responsible for this work. The First Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital dispatched hundreds of personnel to participate in the survey, linking them with factories, streets, and other survey units, conducting health surveys and publicizing hygiene knowledge in factories and streets every day or regularly. Many medical departments have completed the survey of cancer and hypertension, as well as the investigation of infectious and occupational diseases. After conducting investigations of occupational diseases and common diseases in 23 factories, the First Hospital also established health cards for employees and conducted regular follow-up examinations and treatments for them.

During the survey, the party secretaries and presidents of various hospitals personally took charge, went deep into the front lines, and directed the work; many experienced and well-known doctors also went to factories and streets with the medical staff of departments and offices, treating, publicizing, and guiding at the same time. Experts such as Qu Honghan, director of the Department of Surgery of the Second Central Hospital of Tianjin, and Shi Xi'en, director of the Department of Urology of the First Central Hospital of Tianjin, went deep into the masses to conduct examinations, treatments, publicity, and guidance. To facilitate the masses, medical personnel in this survey worked during the workers' spare time. They brought their own food, went out early and returned late, and worked tirelessly. In this health survey, in order to adapt to the new situation of the people's production and life organization in the urban areas, medical personnel paid special attention to conducting health examinations for children in newly built kindergartens and nurseries in the streets, and helped establish health systems and publicize children's health knowledge to childcare workers.

Due to the solid and meticulous work of the medical personnel of various hospitals in this survey movement, the sanitary conditions of many streets and factories have been greatly improved, the incidence rate has decreased, and epidemics have been controlled. In the Hedong District, the absenteeism rate due to illness in factories and enterprises was 2.79% in the fourth quarter of last year, and dropped to 2.1% in the first quarter of this year. Many factories have emerged with disease-free workshops and groups. Twenty days after carrying out the pest and disease elimination survey, the number of outpatients in the health station of the Tianjin Carpet Factory decreased by one-third. Secondly, through this survey, organizational structures were established and improved, and the health care organization was reformed. The technical forces of hospitals, health centers, and health stations were comprehensively organized. Health stations and workshop doctors were set up in street production service cooperatives and large factory workshops. After going deep into the factories, medical personnel gradually understood the workers' production conditions, found the causes of occupational diseases among employees, and took prevention and control measures. Through the health survey, the broad masses have increasingly realized the importance of doing a good job in sanitation, and the ideological awareness of the medical personnel has also been significantly improved after they went deep into the masses, establishing new relationships with the broad masses.

    把疾病消灭在医院大门之外
    天津开展全民性的健康调查工作
    本报讯　天津市医务人员和广大群众，
  掀起了以除害灭病为中心的全民性的健康调查工作。目前据六个区的统计，已普查了二百八十万人的健康状况。
    天津市广大医务人员为了不断提高人民健康水平，提出“不灭疾病誓不休”的战斗口号。全市95％的医务人员走出医院，深入工厂、街道等集体生活单位进行健康状况调查，主动地防治疾病。各级医院和门诊部，对日常门诊与住院医疗作了适当安排，抽出大批医务人员专门负责这项工作。第一结核病防治院抽出百人次投入普查工作，他们与工厂、街道等普查单位挂钩，每天或定期下厂、下街道进行健康状况调查和宣传卫生常识。许多医疗部门完成了癌瘤、高血压病普查和传染病、职业病的调查。第一医院在二十三个工厂进行了职业病和多发病的调查后，还为职工建立了健康卡片，定期为他们进行复查和治疗。
    在普查工作中，各医院的党委书记、院长都亲自挂帅，深入现场，指挥工作；许多经验丰富的著名医师也都和科、室医务员一起下工厂和街道，遇有传染病或疑难病症，即及时进行治疗。天津市第二中心医院外科主任屈鸿翰、天津市第一中心医院泌尿科主任施锡恩等专家都深入群众，边检查，边治疗，边宣传，边指导。为了方便群众，医务人员在这次普查中，都利用工人业余时间进行工作，他们自带干粮，早出晚归，废寝忘食地坚持工作。在这次健康普查中，医务人员为适应城区人民生产和生活组织起来的新形势，特别注意对街道新建起的幼儿园、托儿所的儿童进行健康检查，并帮助建立卫生制度，向保教人员宣传儿童保健常识。
    由于各医院的医务人员在这一次普查运动中踏踏实实，深入细致的工作，使许多街道、工厂的卫生面貌大为改观，发病率下降，流行病得到了控制。河东区工厂企业去年第四季度的因病缺勤率为2.79％，今年第一季度降为2.1％。许多工厂出现了一批无病休车间和小组。在开展除害灭病的普查后二十天，天津地毯厂保健站的门诊人数减少了三分之一。其次，经过这次普查，建立和健全了组织机构，改革保健组织。全面的组织了医院、卫生院和保健站的技术力量。在街道生产服务社和大工厂车间设置了保健站和车间医师。医务人员深入工厂后逐步了解了工人的生产情况，找到了职工职业病发病原因，并采取防治措施。经过健康普查，广大群众越来越多的认识到做好卫生工作的重要意义，而医务人员深入到群众中以后，思想觉悟也有了显著提高，与广大群众建立了新的关系。
