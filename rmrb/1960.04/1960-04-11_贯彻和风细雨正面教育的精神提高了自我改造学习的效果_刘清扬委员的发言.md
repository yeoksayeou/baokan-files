Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and Vice Premier Tan's report. Now, I would like to share some personal experiences regarding the learning method of implementing gentle and positive education.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party last year, the joint meeting of the Standing Committees of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPPCC decided to launch a study movement centered on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the general line of socialist construction among people from all walks of life in Hebei Province. In the study, the method of gentle and positive education was implemented, and the method of large-scale decentralization and small-scale concentration was adopted. Representatives from all walks of life in the province and Tianjin were conducted under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Study Committee for People from All Walks of Life organized jointly by the Provincial and Municipal CPPCC. All districts in Tianjin and all medium and small cities in our province established study organizations separately under the leadership and promotion of the Party committees and CPPCC committees at all levels. Intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen, and members of various democratic parties conducted studies separately based on enterprises and work posts. A total of more than 149,000 members participated in the study throughout the province. More than 500 study members directly organized and led by the Provincial Study Committee for People from All Walks of Life, including provincial and municipal committee members of various democratic parties, non-party democratic人士,厅局长,处长,大,专学校的校长,院长, professors, people from medical, scientific and technological, literary and art, industrial and commercial, ethnic minority, and religious circles, as well as provincial and municipal CPPCC members and people from society, were divided into more than 20 study groups according to parties and sectors, and concentratedly studied for six and a half days a week from October 1959 to January 1960.

In the early stage of the study, the responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal Party committees were first invited to repeatedly conduct ideological mobilization, conscientiously implement the spirit of gentle and positive education, and adopt a series of positive education methods, so that the consciousness of learning was gradually improved, and the study gradually deepened. Everyone felt that this study was very rewarding, which not only improved ideological understanding but also made them feel happy.

In this study, the following methods were mainly adopted in accordance with the spirit of gentle and positive education:

I. Organize various report meetings to conduct positive education so that everyone can learn as much as possible about the development of production in various aspects. In conjunction with the study, responsible comrades from relevant departments were invited to report on the construction of the people's commune, water conservancy construction, the great steelmaking campaign, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and other socialist construction situations. When visiting various places, the method of on-site visits and on-site reporting was adopted, and responsible comrades of municipal, county, and grassroots Party committees were invited to report and introduce the great changes in production construction and people's lives. These reports are rich in content, vivid, realistic, and persuasive. At the same time, after listening and watching, it was generally reflected that: after listening to the report and seeing the scene, I felt bright in my heart, felt deeply, and gained a lot.

II. Organized large-scale visits. After a period of study, discussion, and reading documents, in order to help everyone deeply understand the spirit of the documents and reports and solve ideological problems, three large-scale visits were organized. Visited the Ten Great Buildings of Beijing; visited the People's Commune in the suburbs of Tianjin; visited Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Baoding and other three regions, such as visiting the Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County and several People's Communes in Anguo County, Gangnan and other large and small reservoirs, and also visited hydraulic coal mining, pharmaceutical factories, fiber factories and many other large factories and mines and some small foreign-style enterprises, with rich and colorful content. Through visits, everyone received an extremely vivid and profound general line education. Everyone reflected: "Seeing is better than hearing", "Visiting for seven or eight days is better than reading for ten years". Through practical observation and experience, many problems in my mind have been clarified, and many contents of the reports and documents have been confirmed by objective reality. Many people were "surprised and unexpected" by the rapid development of construction in various places; some said: "It is undoubtedly the development of large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and it has never been thought that the production and construction of small and medium-sized cities has also developed so fast", "In the past, I saw many amazing deeds in newspapers and movies, and I thought in my heart that there might be some exaggeration in publicity, but now it seems that the past reports only reflected a part of the objective reality". One study member's three sons and one nephew were drowned in the past when the Hutuo River breached its banks. This time, when he saw the completion of the Gangnan Reservoir, which eradicated the water disaster, he was moved to tears. After the visit, I further realized the greatness and correctness of the general line of socialist construction. Many people reflected: "The great victory of the general line can be seen everywhere", "The general line is infinitely powerful". The understanding of the development and construction of the people's commune has also been greatly improved, and the inevitability and superiority of the people's commune have been understood. During the visit, I also saw the soaring enthusiasm of workers and peasants everywhere, which moved everyone very much. One member of the medical community said: "Seeing the masses working happily bare-chested in the cold weather of minus a few degrees, and hearing the model deeds of covering the soil with their own quilts to ensure the quality of the reservoir project and prevent the soil from freezing, compared with our intellectuals who regard knowledge as their own and are unwilling to actively contribute it, the contrast is really dwarfed, and I really feel my own insignificance." Many people have examined their past wrong understanding and expressed their determination to remold themselves well. Through the visit activities, everyone also further realized that "this general line study has specifically and deeply implemented the method of gentle education", "The Party is sincerely helping us to remold our thinking and improve our understanding". Many people were deeply moved, changed their learning attitude, and improved their consciousness of learning.

III. Repeatedly held ideological report meetings during the learning process. Not long after the start of the study, in response to the attitude and understanding of the study, some typical people were nominated by the group and reported at the study report meeting on their personal understanding of the study, how to eliminate concerns, correct their learning attitude, and strive to learn well, which played a great role in promoting the study. After returning from the visit, on the basis of group discussions, a report meeting on the visit and study was held, where each group reported on the visit, and each group also promoted some members with greater ideological gains to speak out and report on their experiences and feelings, so as to achieve mutual enlightenment, self-education, and expand the effect of the visit and study. In the later stage of the study, according to the degree of improvement in understanding of certain major issues, some special speeches were organized to report on personal study experiences and understanding of a certain issue. At these report meetings, the different feelings and ideological changes in the study, as well as different understandings, were reflected through personal experiences. This ideological report meeting fully embodies the spirit of self-education, with free and lively forms and realistic and specific content, which is in line with everyone's ideological situation and requirements, and thus is conducive to promoting the in-depth development and opening up of ideas. Experience has proved that this method is an effective mass line method of self-education and self-remolding.

IV. The above learning methods are closely combined with careful reading of documents and group discussions. Through methods such as studying documents, listening to reports, visiting, ideological reporting, and discussions, it is also the method of "listening, looking, thinking, and talking" in the gentle and positive education. This makes it easier to promote everyone to consciously use their brains, connect with reality, think about problems, and distinguish right from wrong. Therefore, many people reflected: "This study is both relaxed and happy, makes people feel happy, and can improve understanding and solve problems."

After more than three months of study, most people have improved to varying degrees, and have a further understanding of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, the Great Steelmaking Campaign, the mass movement, and so on, and clarified some vague ideas and wrong views. As a result, the ideological awareness of many people has been greatly improved, and they have taken a step forward in the transformation of their political stand. Many people have played a positive and active role in serving the cause of socialist construction in their posts and have made remarkable achievements. The achievement of these achievements is mainly due to the importance and care of the provincial and municipal Party committees, and the Party organizations of organs, schools, and enterprises have given great support to the members participating in the study in terms of work and time. In the study, the organizational role of the CPPCC, democratic parties, and the Study Committee was brought into play, and the method of mass line self-education was implemented, so that better learning results were achieved.

Through the general line study movement, I feel that the two issues that I have a deeper understanding of are as follows:

I. Deeply realize that strengthening self-remolding is an urgent political task. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country, thanks to the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, has entered a new stage of high-speed and sustained leap forward in socialist construction. All socialist construction undertakings are developing rapidly and changing rapidly, and the face of the motherland is changing with each passing day. Therefore, just as some comrades said after the visit: "Deep feelings, pleasant surprise." Many people feel that although they live in such a great era today, they have a serious state of not knowing each other in the socialist construction of the motherland. I deeply feel that if we do not strengthen self-education and self-remolding, we will not only be unable to adapt to the needs of the current situation, but also be in danger of being abandoned by society and falling behind. Therefore, I believe that in today's situation of leaping development of socialist construction undertakings, it is of great significance to step up ideological remolding, and it is also the urgent demand of the vast number of intellectuals. We must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the widespread and in-depth movement to study Mao Zedong's works, strengthen the transformation of the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview. Arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and use it as a pointer for all our work. We must consciously step up self-remolding, truly achieve "taking care of one end and leaning to one side", taking care of the interests of the country and the people wholeheartedly, and leaning towards socialism wholeheartedly.

II. Correctly understand the method of gentle and positive education. In this regard, there were some different views at the beginning of the study. For example, some people think that since we implement gentle education, we should not connect with reality, and we should not carry out criticism and self-criticism, and we are tired of listening to and afraid of mentioning transformation. Some people think that gentle education is the only correct method. In the past, present, and future, this method should be used as the only method for learning and self-remolding. They think that the implementation of this method was not enough in the past, which is a shortcoming, or even a mistake, and should be regretted. Even more people suspect that gentle education is a strategic means, a long-term line to catch big fish, and do not believe that gentle education can be consistently implemented, and so on. After study and discussion, especially after the specific implementation of the method of gentle and positive education in the more than three months of general line study, everyone improved their understanding. Many people examined their one-sided understanding and even wrong views in the early stage of the study. As a result, I deeply realized that the Party is deeply caring and caring for us. In fact, for ten years, the Party has always adopted the policy of unity, education, and transformation towards intellectuals. The Party has always implemented the policy of peaceful transformation towards the industrial and commercial circles. This shows that the Party's understanding of us is comprehensive and profound, and the Party believes that most of us can be transformed and can serve socialism under the specific historical conditions of our country. The key lies in whether we can accept and implement the Party's great policy and guidelines, that is, whether we can accept socialist transformation. In other words, it depends on what attitude we hold towards socialist transformation. Here, accepting transformation is the premise, the first question; and what method is used to transform is the second question. Only if we affirm the premise of continuing to accept transformation, the method of self-education and self-remolding of gentle education can be implemented. And the implementation of this method is to better realize our fundamental transformation. Without the purpose of fundamental transformation, gentle education would lose all its meaning and role. Therefore, some people on the one hand express their welcome to gentle education, on the other hand, they are tired of listening to and afraid of mentioning transformation, afraid of criticism and self-criticism, and separate gentle education from self-transformation, which is a manifestation of a lack of self-consciousness in transformation. This should attract the attention of each of us. As for regarding gentle education as a policy guideline applicable to any situation, instead of as the Party teaches us: under the specific conditions of our country, under the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, gentle education is also a form of class struggle; and it is a more frequent form of class struggle. Gentle education is a policy guideline to better achieve fundamental transformation.

As for the adoption of gentle education or rapid storm form, this is determined by the objective situation of class struggle, and not by anyone's subjective wishes. This depends on the objective situation of whether we accept socialist transformation. It is obviously incorrect to look at this issue from the perspective of leaving the class analysis.

It is even more wrong to doubt and resist the Party's policies and guidelines, be half-hearted, and even look at this issue from a hostile standpoint, such as thinking that it is a long-term line to catch big fish.

Regarding this issue: the documents adopted by the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have made a very profound and comprehensive analysis, which can help us correctly understand this issue.

Vice Chairman Chen Shutong pointed out in his work report at this CPPCC plenary session: "The method of gentle education is to implement the mass line, use the method of criticism and self-criticism, induce in many ways, enlighten each other, reveal objectively existing problems, develop free debate, present facts, reason, analyze problems, and solve problems on the basis of constantly improving consciousness." I think this is a completely correct statement. Leaving this comprehensive and correct understanding, such as understanding the method of gentle education with various wrong ideas, and carrying out ideological transformation work, it will not be possible to deeply and meticulously dig out ideas and solve problems, and it will not be possible to well implement the method of gentle and positive education. Past experience has proved that only by correcting our learning attitude, correctly understanding and implementing the method of self-education and self-remolding of gentle education, can we obtain the effect of self-remolding with the spirit of continuous revolution.

I hope all the committee members will correct the above speech.

专栏：

    贯彻和风细雨正面教育的精神提高了自我改造学习的效果
    刘清扬委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护两位李副总理的报告，并同意陈叔通副主席关于政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作和谭副总理的报告。今就贯彻和风细雨正面教育的学习方法，谈点个人的体会。
    去年党的八届八中全会以后，经政协河北省委员会和政协天津市委员会常委会联席会议协商决定，在河北省各界人士中开展了以党的八届八中全会决议和建设社会主义总路线为中心的学习运动。在学习中贯彻了和风细雨、正面教育的方法，并采取了大分散、小集中的方式。省和天津市的各界代表人士是在省、市政协共同组织的河北省省会各界人士学习委员会领导下进行的。天津市各区和我省各中、小城市是在各级党委和政协委员会领导推动下分别建立学习组织。一般知识分子、工商业者和各民主党派成员，则以企业和工作岗位为基地，分别进行学习。全省参加学习的成员共计十四万九千余人。在省会各界人士学习委员会直接组织领导下的学习成员五百多人，其中有各民主党派省、市委员，无党派民主人士，省、市机关中的厅局长、处长，大、专学校的校长、院长、教授，医务界、科学技术界、文艺界、工商界、少数民族和宗教界人士，还有省、市政协委员和社会人士；按照党派、界别划分为二十多个学习小组，自1959年10月至1960年1月，每周用六个半天的时间集中地进行了学习。
    在学习初期，首先请省、市党委负责同志，反复进行了思想动员，认真贯彻了和风细雨和正面教育的精神，并采取了一系列的正面教育的方式，从而学习的自觉性逐步提高，学习随之逐步深入。大家感到这次学习收获很大，既提高了思想认识，又心情舒畅。
    在这次学习中，根据和风细雨、正面教育的精神，主要采取了以下的一些方法：
    一、组织各种报告会，进行正面教育，让大家尽多的了解各方面生产发展的情况。结合学习，邀请有关部门的负责同志分别就人民公社、水利建设、大炼钢铁、工农业生产大跃进等各项社会主义建设的情况作报告；在赴各地参观时，并采取就地参观、就地作报告的办法，请市县和基层党委负责同志作报告，介绍生产建设和人民生活巨大变化的情况。这些报告，内容丰富、生动现实、说服力强。同时边听边看、普遍反映：听了报告，看了现场，心里豁亮了，感受深，收获大。
    二、组织了规模较大的参观活动。在经过一段学习座谈、阅读文件之后，为了帮助大家深入领会文件和报告的精神，解决思想意识上的问题，曾组织了三次较大规模的参观。参观了北京十大建筑；在天津郊区参观人民公社；到石家庄、唐山、保定等三个地区进行参观访问，如参观访问了遵化县建明人民公社和安国县的几个人民公社，岗南及其它各地的大小水库，还参观了水力采煤、制药厂、纤维厂等许多大厂矿和一些小洋群企业，内容丰富多彩。通过参观访问，对大家进行了一次极为生动而深刻的总路线教育。大家反映：“百闻不如一见”，“参观七八天，胜读十年书”，通过实际的观察体会，脑子里的一堆问题，澄清了许多，报告和文件上的许多内容得到了客观现实的印证。许多人对各地建设事业飞速发展，“感到惊奇，出乎意料”；有的说：“认为京津大城市的发展是无疑的，根本未想到中小城市生产建设也发展的这样快”，“过去看到报刊上和电影中的许多惊人的事迹，在内心里认为在宣传上，可能有些夸大，现在看来过去的报道，仅仅是反映了客观实际的一部分”。有一位学习成员因过去滹沱河决口泛滥，他的三个儿子和一个侄子都被淹死，这次看到岗南水库建成，根绝了水患，他感动得流下泪来。经过参观之后，进一步体会到社会主义建设总路线的伟大和正确，许多人反映：“到处看到总路线的伟大胜利”，“总路线威力无穷”。对人民公社的发展建设，在认识上也提高了一大步，理解了人民公社产生的必然性和它的优越性。在参观当中，到处还看到了工人、农民群众的冲天干劲，使大家很受感动。有一位医务界的成员说：“看到在零下几度的冷天，光着膀子愉快劳动的群众，听到为了保证水库的工程质量，防止泥土冻结而用自己的棉被盖在土上的模范事迹，跟我们知识分子把知识据为私有，而不愿意积极贡献出来，两者对比，真是相形见绌，实在感到自己渺小。”许多人纷纷检查自己过去的错误认识，并表示决心要好好改造自己。通过参观活动，同时使大家也进一步认识到“这次总路线学习具体深入地贯彻了和风细雨的方法”，“党是真诚帮助我们改造思想、提高认识的”。许多人深受感动，改变了学习态度，提高了学习的自觉性。
    三、在学习过程中，反复举行了思想汇报会。开始学习不久，针对学习态度和认识，经小组酝酿推选了一些典型人，在学习汇报会上，汇报了个人对学习的认识以及如何破除顾虑、端正学习态度，争取学好等问题，这对促进学习起了很大推动作用。参观归来后，在小组座谈讨论的基础上，召开了参观学习汇报会，由各团汇报参观情况，每个团还都推出一些思想收获较大的成员现身说法，汇报参观心得和体会，达到了互相启发、自我教育、扩大参观学习效果的目的。在学习后期，根据对某些重大问题认识提高的程度，又组织了一些专题发言，汇报个人的学习心得及对某个问题的认识。在这些汇报会上，通过现身说法，反映了在学习中不同的感受和思想变化，以及不同的认识。这种思想汇报会，充分体现了自我教育的精神，形式自由活泼，内容现实具体，符合大家的思想状况和要求，因而有利于促进学习的深入发展和敞开思想。经验证明，这种方法，是自我教育和自我改造有效的群众路线的方法。
    四、以上学习方法和认真阅读文件与小组座谈讨论紧密结合进行，通过学习文件、听报告、参观、思想汇报、座谈讨论等方法，也就是“听听、看看、想想、谈谈”和风细雨正面教育的方法。这样便于促进大家自觉地开动脑筋，联系实际，思考问题，分辨是非。因此，许多人反映：“这次学习既轻松愉快、心情舒畅，又能提高认识、解决问题。”
    经过三个多月的学习，多数人都有了不同程度的提高，对总路线、大跃进、人民公社、大炼钢铁、群众运动等等问题，都有了进一步的认识，澄清了一些模糊思想和错误观点。从而使许多人思想觉悟大大的提高了一步，在政治立场改造上前进了一步。不少的人在本岗位工作上，发挥了为社会主义建设事业服务的积极主动性，做出了显著的成绩。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于省、市党委的重视关怀，机关学校、企业党组织对参加学习的成员，在工作上和时间上给了很大支持。在学习中，发挥了政协、民主党派和学习委员会的组织作用，贯彻了群众路线自我教育的方法，因之收到了较好的学习效果。
    通过总路线学习运动，我感到体会较深的有以上两个问题：
    一、深刻认识到加强自我改造是刻不容缓的政治任务。我们的国家在党和毛主席的英明、正确领导下，由于有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，有了1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，使我国的社会主义建设已经进入一个高速度的持续跃进的新阶段。各项社会主义建设事业都是突飞猛进，一日千里，祖国的面貌，日新月异。因之正像有的同志在参观访问以后所说的：“深刻的感受，愉快的惊奇。”很多人都感觉到自己虽然生活在今天这样伟大的时代，但对祖国的社会主义建设，存在着严重的相见不相识的状况。深感如不加强自我教育和自我改造，不仅不能适应当前形势发展的需要，而且有被社会抛弃和掉队的危险。因此，我认为在今天社会主义建设事业一浪高一浪地飞跃发展的形势下，加紧思想改造是有重大意义的，也是广大知识分子的迫切要求。我们必须更高的举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，积极投入广泛深入地学习毛泽东著作的运动，加强改造资产阶级的世界观，树立无产阶级的世界观。以毛泽东思想武装自己，并作为我们一切工作的指针。必须自觉地加紧自我改造，真正作到“顾一头，一边倒”，一心顾国家和人民的利益，一心倒向社会主义。
    二、正确理解和风细雨、正面教育的方法。对此，在学习之初是有些不同看法的。如有的人认为既贯彻和风细雨，就不要联系实际，不要开展批评与自我批评了，对于改造厌听怕提。有的人认为和风细雨是唯一正确的方法。过去、现在和将来都应以这一方法作为唯一的学习和自我改造的方法，认为过去贯彻这一方法不够，是个缺点，甚至是错误，应引为遗憾。更有的人怀疑和风细雨是策略手段，是放长线的钓大鱼，不相信和风细雨能够经常贯彻下去等等错误的看法和想法。经过学习讨论，特别是经过在三个多月总路线学习中，对和风细雨、正面教育方法的具体贯彻执行，大家提高了认识。许多人检查了自己在学习初期的片面认识，以至错误的观点。从而深刻体会到党对我们是深切照顾，关怀备至。事实上，十年来党对知识分子一贯采取的是团结教育改造的政策。党对工商界也一贯施行的是和平改造的政策。这说明党对我们的认识是全面的、深刻的，党相信我们大多数人在我国的具体历史条件下，是可以改造过来并能够为社会主义服务的。关键在于我们是否能够接受和贯彻执行党的这一伟大的政策方针，也就是说在于我们是否能够接受社会主义改造。换句话说，看我们对社会主义改造抱什么态度。在这里，接受改造是前提，是第一位的问题；而用什么方法改造，则是第二位的问题。只有在我们肯定继续接受改造的前提下，和风细雨的自我教育、自我改造的方法，才有可能贯彻。而贯彻这个方法又是为了更好地实现我们的根本改造。离开了根本改造这个目的，和风细雨也就失去了它的全部意义和作用。因此，有的人一面表示欢迎和风细雨，一面又对改造厌听怕提，害怕批评与自我批评，把和风细雨同自我改造分割开来，这是对改造缺乏自觉性的表现。这应引起我们每一个人的注意。至于把和风细雨看成是适用于任何情况下的政策方针，而不是像党教导我们的：在我国的具体条件下，在党的和平改造方针下，和风细雨也是阶级斗争的一种形式；而且是一种更为经常的阶级斗争形式。和风细雨是为了更好地实现根本改造的政策方针。
    至于采取和风细雨，还是急风暴雨的形式，这是由客观阶级斗争的形势所决定的，而不是由任何人的主观愿望所决定的。这要看我们是不是接受社会主义改造的客观情况，离开阶级分析的观点，来看待这一问题，显然是不正确的。
    对党的政策方针怀疑抵触，三心二意，甚至站在敌对的立场上来看待这一问题，如认为是放长线钓大鱼显然更是错误的。
    关于这一问题：民建中央和全国工商联两会代表大会所通过的文件，作了极深刻而全面的分析，可以帮助我们正确理解这一问题。
    陈叔通副主席在此次政协全体会议上的工作报告中指出：“和风细雨的方法就是贯彻群众路线，用批评和自我批评的方法，多方诱导，互相启发，在不断提高自觉的基础上揭露客观存在的问题、发展自由辩论、摆事实、讲道理，分析问题，解决问题”。我认为这是完全正确的提法，离开这一全面正确的理解，如以种种错误的想法理解和风细雨的方法，进行思想改造的工作，是不会深入细致地挖掘思想而解决问题，也就不能很好地贯彻和风细雨、正面教育的方法。过去的经验证明，只有端正学习态度，正确的理解和贯彻和风细雨的自我教育和自我改造的方法，才能以不断革命的精神，获得自我改造的效果。
    以上发言，希望各位委员指正。
