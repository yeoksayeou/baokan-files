Chairman, fellow committee members:

We fully agree with and support the report on the draft of the 1960 national economic plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

In recent years, under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, Guangxi has not only achieved a great leap forward in economic construction, political construction, and cultural construction, but also launched a vigorous leap forward in mobilizing people from all walks of life to write historical and literary materials. Now, let's talk about this situation.

A great leap forward has emerged in the work of writing historical and literary materials

Since the closing of the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC last year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the CPPCC has actively responded to Chairman Zhou Enlai's call to widely mobilize CPPCC members and relevant people from all over the region to write historical materials from the past century. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the specific guidance of the National Committee of the CPPCC, this work has rapidly developed into a mass movement, with more and more people participating. In order to promote the development of this movement, the Regional CPPCC established a "Committee for the Collection of Historical and Literary Materials," which actively carried out its work, successively holding many symposiums. A total of 420 CPPCC members from the region, CPPCC members from cities and counties, and people from all walks of life participated in the symposiums. At the symposiums, they listened to speeches by responsible comrades from the United Front Work Department of the Regional Party Committee. After informal discussions, they further recognized the great significance of writing historical and literary materials. In particular, they felt very excited about Chairman Zhou Enlai's call and unanimously expressed their determination to do this work well. They all made plans and immediately began to take action. As of January this year, 23 CPPCC members and people from all walks of life have submitted 64 written materials, many of which have high reference value. Then, people were sent to various cities and municipal CPPCCs in the region to strengthen contact and exchange opinions. At a symposium held by the Guilin Municipal CPPCC, people from all walks of life were very enthusiastic and energetic. They jointly proposed an initiative to launch a friendly competition with Liuzhou, Nanning, and Wuzhou. After receiving the initiative from Guilin City, the Liuzhou Municipal CPPCC immediately held a symposium with people from all walks of life to discuss the challenge. They were even more energetic and proposed a great leap forward target of writing 15 million to 20 million words of historical and literary materials this year, striving to complete 6 million to 7 million words before May Day. They also put forward a heroic slogan: "Playing a triumphant song to welcome the east wind, our drive surpasses Guilin, Wuzhou, and Nanning. Adhering to politics in command, two million words will not be in vain. Combining service and transformation, writing materials to win the first achievement." People from all walks of life in Nanning City were not far behind. They confidently expressed that they would strive to surpass Guilin and Liuzhou in both quantity and quality.

The situation of the Great Leap Forward encourages people to contribute their strength

The emergence of such a lively situation in the writing of historical and literary materials is by no means accidental. It is a concrete manifestation of the continued implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism and a more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Under the shining light of the Party's general line, and encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, people do feel excited, feel that they must set high ambitions and aspirations, dedicate their strength, and actively do good things for socialism. Therefore, upon hearing the Party's call to write historical and literary materials, they deeply felt that the road to serving socialism is broad, and that it is indeed possible to do their best, give full play to their initiative, and contribute to socialism. Therefore, some people said:
"Now I want to serve the country with my writing!" Some people said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, my old tree will also blossom!" Some people also said: "Doing something beneficial for the country and the people, life is becoming more and more meaningful." Among them, some people, although old, do not spare any effort, writing day and night. Some people also write letters to their relatives and friends to connect, while others personally visit others, exchange materials, encourage each other, and help each other. They are serious in their attitude and happy in their mood, treating this work with full enthusiasm, fully reflecting an atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward.

However, this situation was not like this from the beginning. All work must be commanded by political ideology and adhere to putting politics in command in order to make the work colorful and effective. In the beginning, some people were not clear enough about the significance of this work, and there were still some unnecessary concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the importance of writing historical and literary materials, and repeatedly explain that the scope of writing historical and literary materials is very broad. Military, political, economic, cultural, social situations, customs, etc., can all be written, regardless of point of view, regardless of style. Comprehensive and systematic materials are of course good, and bits and pieces are also acceptable. As long as you write down what you have experienced and seen and heard truthfully, that is good. After repeated explanations and multiple symposiums, everyone broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and understood both the importance of the work and that materials from all aspects could be written, and that everyone had materials to write. Everyone had something to look forward to, and their enthusiasm became greater and greater. From this, we realized that vigorously carrying out ideological mobilization and breaking down concerns is a primary key to doing this work well.

While doing a good job in ideological work, the Regional CPPCC also focused on urging everyone participating in this work to make their own writing plans, stipulating the topics, content, number of words, progress, and measures to be taken, etc. It also plans to hold some symposiums regularly or take other methods to strengthen contact, and enable CPPCC members and people from all walks of life who write historical and literary materials to have the opportunity to exchange opinions, share experiences, help each other, and encourage each other, so that everyone's enthusiasm will become higher and higher in the work. In addition, some people are old and sick and cannot write, but their enthusiasm is equally high and they are willing to dictate. The Regional CPPCC has sent some cadres to help record.

Writing historical and literary materials is an important way of self-transformation

From our work, we have deeply realized the great significance of writing historical and literary materials. First of all, we are historical materialists. As Chairman Mao taught us: "We must not only understand China today, but also understand China yesterday and the day before yesterday." "To truthfully record what happened in our country yesterday and the day before yesterday, to enrich the historical materials of our motherland, and to let historical science workers use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to analyze and evaluate them, and draw correct conclusions, so that the past can serve the present, and serve the cause of socialism, will be of great benefit to the current and future revolutionary work. Secondly, the older generation has experienced both the old and new societies. The historical and literary materials they write will naturally touch upon the issue of the comparison between the old and new societies. Through the comparison between the old and new societies, it is not only of profound educational significance for the younger generation who have not experienced the various sufferings and hardships of the old society; but also for the writers themselves, it is an important way of self-education and self-transformation.

Our work is only just beginning, and we cannot talk about any achievements or experiences, but we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and with the guidance and help of the National Committee of the CPPCC, coupled with the unremitting efforts of people from all walks of life in our region, we will definitely be able to make greater achievements and excellently complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

### 撰写文史资料工作具有重要意义  丘辰、吕集义和陆榕树委员的联合发言

专栏：

    撰写文史资料工作具有重要意义
    丘辰、吕集义和陆榕树委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及陈叔通副主席所作的政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    我们广西，在自治区党委的直接领导下，年来不仅在经济建设、政治建设、文化建设各个方面实现了大跃进，即在发动各界人士撰写文史资料方面也出现了一个轰轰烈烈的跃进局面。现在，我们谈一谈这方面的情况。
    撰写文史资料工作出现了一个跃进局面
    自从去年第三届政协全国委员会第一次会议闭幕后，政协广西僮族自治区委员会积极响应周恩来主席的号召，广泛地发动全区政协委员及各方面有关人士撰写近百年历史资料。由于自治区党委的加强领导，政协全国委员会的具体指导，这个工作迅速地形成一个群众性运动，参加的人愈来愈多。为了推动这个运动的开展，区政协成立了一个“文史资料征集委员会”，积极进行工作，先后召开多次座谈会，参加座谈会的有区政协委员、市、县政协委员和各方面的人士达四百二十人次。在座谈会中，听了区党委统战部负责同志的讲话，经过漫谈讨论，进一步认识了撰写文史资料的重要意义，尤其是对于周恩来主席的号召，大家感到十分兴奋，一致表示决心，一定要把这个工作做好，纷纷订出计划，立即开始行动。截至今年1月止，区政协委员及各方面人士已有二十三人送来写好的资料共六十四篇，其中有不少的一部分有较高的参考价值。接着又派人到区内各市和市政协加强联系，交换意见。在桂林市政协召开的一次座谈会上，各界人士热情很高，干劲很大，联合提出倡议，向柳州、南宁、梧州各市发起友谊竞赛。柳州市政协接到桂林市的倡议书后，马上召开各界人士座谈会，讨论应战，他们的干劲更大，提出今年撰写文史资料一千五百万至二千万字的跃进指标，争取在“五一”前写好六百万至七百万字。他们还提出了雄迈的口号：“高奏凯歌迎东风，干劲赛过桂梧邕。坚持政治来挂帅，两千万字不落空。服务改造相结合，撰写资料夺头功。”南宁市各界人士也不后人，他们满怀信心地表示争取不论在数量上和质量上都要超过桂林和柳州。
    大跃进的形势鼓舞人们贡献出自己的力量
    在撰写文史资料方面出现这种热热闹闹的局面，决不是偶然的，正是党的建设社会主义总路线继续贯彻和更全面地大跃进的一种具体表现。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进的形势鼓舞下，的确人们都会感到兴奋，感到要树雄心、立大志，献出自己的力量，积极为社会主义做好事，因此一听到党号召写文史资料，都深深地感觉到为社会主义服务的道路是宽广的，的确是可以各尽所能，充分发挥自己的积极性，为社会主义作出贡献的，于是有的人说：
  “现在我要以文章报国了！”有的人说：“在共产党领导下，我这株老干也要开花了！”有的人又说：“为国家、为人民做点有益的事情，生活越来越有意义。”他们当中有的人年纪虽大，也不辞劳苦，夜以继日地写。有的人还写信给自己亲友串连，有的人则亲去访问别人，交换材料，互相勉励，互相帮助，他们态度认真，心情愉快，抱着满腔热情来对待这个工作，充分反映出一种大跃进的气氛。
    可是，这种情况并不是一开始就是如此的。一切工作都要以政治思想为统帅，坚持政治挂帅，工作才能搞得有声有色。在开始的时候，有些人对于这个工作的意义还不够明确，还存在一些不必要的顾虑。因此，需要反复说明撰写文史资料的重要意义，反复说明撰写文史资料的范围是很广泛的，军事、政治、经济、文化、社会情况、风俗习惯等等，都可以写，不拘观点，不拘文体，全面的、有系统的材料固然好，一鳞半爪的也行，只要将自己所经历的、所见所闻的如实地写出来，这就好了。经过反复说明，多次座谈之后，大家破除迷信，解放思想，既明白了工作的重要意义，又认识了各方面的资料都可以写，每个人也都有可写的资料，大家就有了奔头，干劲也就越来越大了。从此，我们体会到，大力进行思想发动，打破顾虑，是做好这个工作的一个首要关键。
    在做好思想工作的同时，区政协还抓紧推动每一参加这个工作的人都订出自己的撰写计划，拟定撰写的题目、内容、字数、进度和措施等等，还打算经常举行一些座谈会或采取其他方法，加强联系，并使撰写文史资料的委员和各界人士，可以有机会交换意见，交流经验，互相帮助，互相勉励，使大家在工作中情绪越来越高。此外，还有一些人士年老有病，不能执笔，但是他们的热情同样是很高的，愿意口述出来，区政协派出了一些干部，帮助记录。
    撰写文史资料工作是自我改造的一条重要途径
    从工作中，我们深刻体会到撰写文史资料的重要意义。首先，我们是历史唯物主义者，正如毛主席所教导我们的：“不但要懂得中国的今天，还要懂得中国的昨天和前天。”“把我国昨天和前天所发生的事情如实地记录下来，以丰富我们祖国的历史资料，让历史科学工作者运用马克思列宁主义的观点去加以分析和评价，作出正确的结论，古为今用，使之服务于社会主义事业，这对于当前和今后的革命工作都会有很大的好处。其次，老一辈的人经历了新旧两个社会，撰写的文史资料，就自然要触及新旧社会的对比这个问题，通过新旧社会的对比，不仅是对于没有体验过旧社会的种种苦难和艰辛的青年一代来说，具有深刻的教育意义；即就撰写者本身来说，也是自我教育、自我改造的一条重要途径。
    我们的工作仅仅是在开始，还谈不到什么成绩和经验，但我们深深地相信，在自治区党委的领导下，在政协全国委员会的指导和帮助下，加上我区各界人士的不懈努力，一定能够做出较大的成绩，出色地完成党交给我们的任务。
