We completely agree with and support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and guarantee to resolutely implement them in our work.

1959 was a year of continued great leap forward in our national economy. Our workplace, Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan), under the cordial care and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the provincial and municipal Party committees, with the strong support of the people of the whole country and fraternal units, and with the help of Soviet experts, through the efforts of all employees, achieved unprecedented great harvests in production and construction and on the ideological front.

Last year, Anshan's steel production increased by 37.4% compared to 1958; pig iron increased by 27.1% compared to 1958; and steel materials increased by 31.8% compared to 1958. Other products, such as steel billets, artificial rich ore, coke, iron ore, iron concentrate, and refractory materials, also overfulfilled the state plan. The total output value increased by 30.5% compared to 1958, labor productivity increased significantly, and costs were greatly reduced, achieving a full-year success. In the first quarter of this year, in the new upsurge of the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Anshan again overfulfilled the plans for various major products, breaking the old rule of slackness at the beginning of the year and winning the victories of a red start, a red first quarter, and a full-year success. All these achievements are the brilliant victory of the Party's general line for building socialism and the brilliant victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

According to our personal experience, in Anshan, a modern large-scale enterprise with more than 100,000 employees, in order to make production and construction colorful and lively, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launch mass movements under the leadership of the Party.

Great Enterprises Must Vigorously Launch Mass Movements
Regarding this issue, there have been disputes and struggles in the past. Before the Great Leap Forward, a relatively common erroneous concept existed in Anshan, which was that Anshan is a modern large enterprise, large in scale and complex in technology, and mass movements could not be carried out. It was wrongly believed that to do a good job in Anshan's production and construction, one could only rely on the "one-chief system," rely on administrative orders, rely on rules and regulations, rely on a few technical personnel, rely on books and formulas, and not rely on mass movements. Under this erroneous concept, mass movements in Anshan at that time could not be launched at all. At that time, this erroneous thinking bound the hands and feet of the masses and did not allow the masses to make revolution. After the Great Leap Forward, the Party's general line illuminated the hearts of Anshan's employees, and the tide of the Great Leap Forward surged in Anshan with irresistible force. The factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee began to be established, and lively mass movements began to rise. At this time, some comrades were reconsidering the issue, and the situation began to change. However, the struggle did not stop. For example, in the second quarter of 1959, due to the machinations of the right-leaning thoughts of a few comrades, and because the policy of vigorously launching mass movements was not earnestly implemented, steel production still did not increase rapidly. In August, under the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all employees of Anshan vigorously opposed right-leaning, greatly boosted their energy, and formed a magnificent mass movement, and the situation in Anshan greatly improved. From that time until now, Anshan has been carrying out mass movements one after another. As a result, the production, technical outlook, and people's mental outlook of the entire company have undergone fundamental changes with leaps and bounds, progressing a thousand miles a day.

From this period of historical development, all employees of Anshan have deeply realized the great significance of the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao that mass movements must be vigorously launched in industrial construction. Facts have educated us that in a modern large enterprise like Anshan, mass movements can not only be vigorously launched, but must be vigorously launched. Only by vigorously launching mass movements can a lively and vigorous situation emerge. Otherwise, the work will inevitably be cold and cheerless, lacking vitality. Now, based on some of the situations of vigorously launching mass movements in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, let's briefly discuss this issue.

Technical Performance Competitions are a New Stage in Anshan's Mass Movement
Vigorously launching mass movements has promoted the great leap forward in Anshan's production and technology. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, Anshan's employees launched a mass movement with joint technical performance competitions as the main content on the basis of the anti-rightist rectification movement. This movement quickly swept across the entire Anshan and generated tremendous power. Judging from the indicators of major products, compared with the average daily output of the first three quarters of last year, steel increased by 18%, pig iron increased by 17%, and steel materials increased by 30.5%. Production increased at such a rapid rate in just a few months, which can be said to be a great leap forward. And the realization of this leap forward was the result of vigorously launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party. This year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has had an even more prominent impact on the promotion of production and technology. In just three months, Anshan's employees put forward more than 390,000 technical innovation proposals. After summarizing, more than 110,000 were implemented, raising the company's level of mechanization from 72% in January to 82.3%, resulting in six automatic production lines, eighty-six linked production lines, one hundred and eighteen assembly lines, and two hundred and seventy-eight single-machine automations. In the first quarter, the company promoted more than 6,000 advanced experiences and created more than 34,000 new production records. Because everyone innovated and everything was innovated, various "high, large, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new" projects were constantly being broken through, and various major technical and economic indicators continued to show miracles. In March, the utilization coefficient of No. 9 blast furnace reached 2.468; the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant reached 10.93, reaching the international advanced level. The output of many newly built rolling mills has increased several times compared to the original design capacity: unmanned operation has been achieved on several operating platforms in the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and the trial rolling of seamless steel tubes with larger diameters on small pipe rolling units has been successful, solving the problem that China currently cannot produce large seamless steel tubes; the Rolling Mill has achieved a "seven-strand" rolling line, increasing output by 30% to 50%, and has created the experience of rolling shaped steel on continuous rolling mills, greatly changing the face of the Rolling Mill. In addition, the Cast Tube Plant has also successfully created a continuous casting machine; the Tool Workshop of the Machine Repair Plant has successfully created an automatic production line, increasing production efficiency by more than twenty times and saving the country a large amount of steel and lathes. Facts are the most persuasive. If it were not for mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of more than 100,000 employees in the mass movement, these unprecedented achievements in production and technology would have been unimaginable.

Ideological Revolution is the Pioneer of Technical Revolution
Mass movements also continuously promote the ideological revolution of employees. To continuously deepen the development of mass movements, the first thing to do is to carry out continuous ideological revolution and carry out the struggle between two roads and two ideologies. In enterprises, there are always people with right-leaning conservative ideas, people who oppose putting politics in command and mass movements, and people who blindly believe in authority and have Jia Gui thoughts. For example, in last year's anti-rightist and technical performance competition movements, some people believed that "potential has been exhausted," "innovation has reached its peak," and "people's subjective initiative has reached its limit"; in this year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, some people believed that "blast furnace fronts have basically been manual production for more than a hundred years and cannot be revolutionized," and that "to achieve world-class technical and economic indicators is a pipe dream"; when the rolling mill initially proposed a technical revolution plan to double production this year, some cadres believed that "the equipment is first-class, the rollers are imported from abroad, and the bearings are designed abroad, and reforming the equipment violates the design principles," and said "no one can solve the problem of the roller table dropping teeth," they simply said that the technical revolution was more difficult than going to heaven. However, as long as these erroneous ideas and arguments are put to the broad masses and open discussions are launched, things will completely change. The masses' daring to speak and act with soaring energy and practical actions completely refuted these erroneous ideas, revealing their true colors. In the face of the turbulent waves of the mass movement, these various right-leaning thoughts were washed away, transformed, submerged, and thoroughly defeated. In this way, the mass movement profoundly promoted the ideological revolution, increased revolutionary ambition, and overcame the bourgeois right-leaning ideology.

In the great mass movement, people's political awareness rapidly improved, and the communist style was promoted as never before. In the movement, new people, new things, and various inventions and creations emerged one after another; the upsurge of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping rose one after another; the communist spirit of giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself was everywhere. Workers insisted on not leaving the front line at critical moments of production, and worked without regard to remuneration. For example, when the employees of the Tool Workshop of the Machine Repair Plant were creating an automatic production line, they overcame various difficulties and went through one hundred and fifty-seven failures, but the workers put forward the slogan of "guarding the line for meals, sleeping with the line, if not successful, not leaving the front line," and after twenty-two days and nights of hard work, they finally succeeded victoriously. Examples of selfless labor like this are truly endless and countless. In the movement, leading cadres went to the front line, shared weal and woe with the masses, and greatly improved the relationship between cadres and the masses and the style of leadership. Engineering and technical personnel and management personnel also increasingly recognized the greatness of the power of the masses and began to actively participate in this great crucible of mass movement, contributing their strengths and transforming themselves. All of this greatly changed people's mental outlook and strengthened the internal unity of the enterprise. Therefore, the mass movement in enterprises not only promoted the rapid development of productive forces, but also became a communist school and a great crucible of ideological revolution in enterprises.

High Production Speed, Management Must Be Highly Efficient
Mass movements also continuously innovated the management work of enterprises, bringing about a new atmosphere in management. Those who oppose vigorously launching mass movements in large enterprises have an erroneous argument that "mass movements will disrupt normal management order" and will "cause chaos." This precisely shows that they do not understand the role of mass movements in management work at all. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, due to national needs, Anshan was required to transfer 100,000 tons of pig iron externally, which caused a serious shortage of steelmaking pig iron within Anshan. If the mass line was not followed and only a few management personnel were relied on to balance and allocate it, it would not be possible to solve the problem. But once a movement was launched, the masses demonstrated the spirit of being the masters of the enterprise and came up with many methods to dig up a lot of scrap steel. As a result, not only did it not affect steel production, but it also ensured that the steelmaking task was overfulfilled. Many rules and regulations in enterprises have been continuously broken and established along with the development of mass movements. In the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, Anshan's employees implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," conducted open discussions, and broke thousands of outdated rules and regulations that hindered the development of productive forces, while also establishing many new and rational rules and regulations, which the masses consciously implemented. Without mass movements, it would not be possible to implement such a comprehensive reform in management work.

Although Anshan's mass movement still needs to be further deepened and improved, and our experience is still limited and there are still many shortcomings, we have deeply realized from the process of struggle in recent years: mass movements are very good, mass movements are very powerful; only by vigorously launching mass movements can Anshan stride forward!

The victory of the mass movement in Anshan is the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Anshan's practice vividly proves that the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao that mass movements must be vigorously launched in industrial construction are very wise and correct. All employees of our Anshan Iron and Steel Company must hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously engage in technical innovation, and bravely fight to overfulfill the production tasks of 1960 ahead of schedule and to achieve continuous leap forward in the steel industry!

    群众运动改变了鞍钢的面貌
    孟泰、王崇伦、李廷顺、杨树棠代表的发言
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春和李先念副总理的报告，保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    1959年是我国国民经济继续大跃进的一年。我们工作所在的鞍钢，在党中央、毛主席和省市委的亲切关怀和正确领导下，在全国人民和各兄弟单位的大力支援以及苏联专家的帮助下，通过全体职工的努力，在生产建设和思想战线上获得了空前的大丰收。
    去年鞍钢的钢产量，比1958年增长了37.4％；生铁比1958年增长了27.1％；钢材比1958年增长了31.8％。其他产品如钢坯、人造富矿、焦炭、铁矿石、铁精矿、耐火材料等也都超额完成了国家计划，总产值比1958年增长了30.5％，劳动生产率有了很大增长，成本有了很大的降低，实现了全年满堂红。今年第一季度，在伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮中，鞍钢又超额地完成了各项主要产品的计划，打破了历年来年初松的老规矩，夺得了开门红、首季红、满堂红的胜利。这一切成就，是党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    按照我们切身的体会，在鞍钢这样有十几万职工的现代化的大型企业里，要把生产、建设搞的有声有色，热火朝天，就必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。
    大企业大搞群众运动非搞不可
    对于这个问题，过去是有过争论和斗争的。大跃进以前，在鞍钢比较普遍地存在着一种错误的观念，就是认为，鞍钢是现代化的大企业，规模很大，技术复杂，不能搞群众运动。错误地认为，要搞好鞍钢的生产、建设，就只有依靠一长制，依靠行政命令，依靠规章制度，依靠少数技术人员，依靠书本和公式，而不能依靠群众运动。在这种错误观念之下，鞍钢当时的群众运动总是发动不起来。那时候，这种错误思想束缚了群众的手脚，不准群众革命。大跃进以后，党的总路线照亮了鞍钢职工的心，大跃进的浪潮以不可阻挡之势在鞍钢掀了起来，党委领导下的厂长负责制开始树立起来，生动活泼的群众运动开始兴起。这时，一些同志正在重新考虑问题，形势开始起了变化。但是，斗争并没有停止。比如，在1959年的第二季度，由于少数同志的右倾思想作怪，由于大搞群众运动的方针没有得到认真的执行，钢铁的生产仍然上涨得不快。到了8月，鞍钢的全体职工在党的八届八中全会决议的精神鼓舞下，狠反右倾，大鼓干劲，形成了一个波澜壮阔的群众运动，鞍钢的形势就大有好转。从那时起，一直到现在，鞍钢是一浪接一浪地开展着群众运动。因此，全公司的生产、技术面貌和人们的精神面貌就产生了突飞猛进、一日千里的根本变化。
    从这一段历史发展过程中，鞍钢的全体职工，深刻地体会到：党和毛主席提出的在工业建设中必须大搞群众运动的指示，具有何等伟大的意义。事实教育我们，在鞍钢这样现代化的大企业，不但可以大搞群众运动，而且非搞不可。只有大搞群众运动，才能出现生龙活虎的局面。否则，工作就一定冷冷清清，缺乏朝气。现在，我们根据去年下半年和今年第一季度大搞群众运动的一些情况，来简单地谈谈这个问题。
    技术表演赛是鞍钢群众运动的新阶段
    大搞群众运动，推动了鞍钢生产和技术的大跃进。比如去年第四季度，鞍钢职工在反右倾整风运动的基础上，开展了一个以联合技术表演赛为主要内容的群众运动。这个运动迅速席卷了整个鞍钢，产生了巨大的威力。从主要产品的指标来看，去年第四季度同前三个季度的平均日产量相比较，钢增长了18％，生铁增长了17％，钢材增长了30.5％。在短短的几个月内，生产以这么大的速度增长，这不能不说是一个很大的跃进。而这个跃进的实现，则是由于在党的领导下，大搞群众运动的结果。今年的技术革新和技术革命运动，对生产、技术的推动就更突出了。在短短的三个月内，鞍钢职工共提出了技术革新建议三十九万多件，经过归纳以后，实现了十一万多件，使全公司的机械化水平由1月份的72％提高到82.3％，出现了六条生产自动线，八十六条生产联动线，一百一十八条流水作业线，二百七十八台单机自动化。在第一季度，全公司推广了六千多项先进经验，创造了三万四千多项生产新纪录。由于人人革新、事事革新，各项“高、大、精、尖、新”的项目不断地被突破，各项主要技术经济指标不断出现了奇迹。3月份，九号高炉的利用系数达到了二点四六八；第一炼钢厂平炉利用系数达到十点九三，达到了国际先进水平。许多新建轧钢厂的产量都比原设计能力翻了几番：无缝钢管厂在几个操作台上实现了无人操作，在小轧管机组上试轧较大直径的无缝钢管成功，解决了我国目前还不能生产大型无缝钢管的问题；轧钢厂实现了“七双”轧制线，提高产量30％至50％以后，又创造了在连轧机上轧制型钢的经验，大大改变了轧钢厂的面貌。此外，铸管厂还创造成功了连续铸管机；机修厂的工具车间创造成功了生产自动线，提高了生产效率二十多倍，为国家节约大批钢材和车床。事实是最具有说服力的。如果不是在群众运动中调动了十多万职工的社会主义积极性和创造性，生产、技术上的这种种前所未有的成就，就根本是不可想像的。
      思想革命是技术革命的先驱
    群众运动还不断的推动了职工的思想革命。要不断的使群众运动深入发展下去，首先就要进行不断的思想革命，进行两条道路和两种思想的斗争。在企业中，有右倾保守思想的人总是有的，反对政治挂帅和群众运动的人也总是有的，迷信权威、有贾桂思想的人也总是有的。比如，在去年的反右倾和技术表演赛运动中，就有人认为“潜力已经挖光”，“革新已经到顶”，“人的主观能动性已经到头了”；在今年的技术革新和技术革命运动中，就有人认为
  “高炉炉前，一百多年来基本就是手工生产，不能革命”，“要达到世界先进技术经济指标，就是空想”；当初轧厂提出今年生产翻番的技术革命规划时，就有干部认为“设备是第一流的，轧辊是国外进口的，轴承是国外设计的，改革设备就是违反设计原理”，并说“谁也解决不了辊道掉牙问题”，他们简直是把技术革命说得比上天还难。但是，只要把这些错误思想和论调放到广大群众中去，展开鸣放辩论，事情就完全变了样子。群众那种敢说敢干的冲天干劲和实际行动，把这些错误思想驳得体无完肤，原形毕露。在群众运动的惊涛骇浪前面，这形形色色的右倾思想，被冲刷、被改造、被淹没，遭到了彻底的失败。这样，群众运动就深刻地推动了思想革命，长了革命的志气，克服了资产阶级的右倾思想。
    在伟大的群众运动中，人们的政治觉悟迅速地提高了，共产主义风格得到了前所未有的发扬。在运动中，新人新事和各种创造发明此起彼应，层出不穷；学、比、赶、帮的热潮，一浪高过一浪；把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义精神到处皆是。工人同志在生产紧张关头坚持不下火线，劳动不计报酬。比如，机修厂工具车间的职工在创造生产自动线时，克服了种种困难，经过了一百五十七次的失败，但工人们提出了“守线餐、伴线眠，不成功，不下火线”的口号，经过二十二昼夜苦战，终于胜利地成功了。类似这样忘我劳动事例真是说不完、数不尽。在运动中，领导干部亲临前线，与群众同甘苦、同劳动，大大改善了干群关系和领导作风。工程技术人员和管理人员也愈来愈认识到群众力量的伟大，而开始积极投身于这一群众运动的伟大熔炉，献其所长，改造自己。这一切，大大改变了人们的精神面貌，加强了企业的内部团结。所以说，企业的群众运动不仅推动了生产力的迅速发展，而且已经成为企业中的共产主义学校和伟大的思想革命的熔炉。
      生产高速度，管理必须高效率
    群众运动还不断地革新了企业的管理工作，使管理上出现了新气象。那些反对在大洋企业大搞群众运动的人，有一个错误的论据，就是说“群众运动会打乱正常的管理秩序”，会“出乱子”。这恰恰说明了他们根本不懂得群众运动对管理工作的作用。比如，去年第四季度，由于国家需要，要求鞍钢外调十万吨生铁，这样在鞍钢内部就造成了炼钢生铁严重不足的情况，如果不走群众路线，只依靠少数管理人员在那里平衡、调拨，那是无论如何也解决不了问题的，但一搞运动，群众就表现了企业主人翁的精神，想出了很多办法，挖掘了许多废钢，结果不但没有影响钢的生产，反而保证炼钢任务超额地完成了。企业中的许多规章制度，随着群众运动的发展，不断地进行了大破大立。在大跃进中，鞍钢的职工在党的领导下，实行了两参、一改、三结合，进行了鸣放辩论，打破了数以千计的束缚生产力发展的清规戒律，同时建立了许多新的合理的规章制度，由群众自觉地加以贯彻。如果没有群众运动，要在管理工作中实行这种全面的改革，那是不可能的。
    虽然鞍钢的群众运动还需要进一步地深入和提高，我们的经验还很少，缺点还很多，但从这几年的斗争过程中，我们已经深深地体会到：群众运动好得很，群众运动威力大得很；只有大搞群众运动，鞍钢才能阔步前进！
    群众运动在鞍钢的胜利，是伟大毛泽东思想的胜利。鞍钢的实践，生动地证明了：党和毛主席提出的在工业建设中必须大搞群众运动的指示，是十分英明而正确的。我们鞍钢的全体职工，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的大旗，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，为提前超额完成1960年的生产任务，为钢铁工业持续不断的跃进，而英勇奋斗！
