I wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

Here, I would like to report to everyone on some experiences of how the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry andCommerce, under the leadership of the Party, promote the members of an enterprise to rely on the enterprise's Party committee, leverage the role of the industry and commerce groups, and encourage members to devote themselves to the "Four Modernizations" movement. I welcome criticisms and corrections from the committee members.

The Jianguo Pneumatic Tool Factory is a joint state-private enterprise with twenty-six private-sector members, most of whom possess certain technical skills. They made some achievements in the Great Leap Forward and the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. This time, the factory called for vigorous efforts in the "Four Modernizations," and workers responded to the call with practical actions. Under the leadership of the Party, the entire factory staff made brilliant achievements and formed a bustling "Four Modernizations" upsurge of competition. Private-sector personnel also joined in the movement, putting forward a large number of suggestions within a few days and working alongside workers for three days and nights to complete ten mechanical improvements and manufacturing projects. The automation of the old shaft single-machine lathe alone increased productivity by twenty-five times, and the automation of the pipe joint machine increased productivity by fifteen times. A young private-sector member worked with the workers to create a mobile crane that was both safe and fast, solving a task that previously required six to eight people an entire day in just half an hour. They also designed a threading machine that replaced twenty lathes with two, which the Party branch initially estimated would increase production value by 400,000 yuan and increase productivity by dozens of times in a year. A private-sector workshop director designed an automatic reverse-axis drilling machine that could be operated by one person for dozens of machines, increasing productivity by thirty times. They also developed three sets of special clamping devices for marking, which improved work efficiency and standardized product specifications. With the help and support of the staff, they successfully trial-produced an automatic tapping machine and a chuck, and then participated in the design and manufacture of a 4.6-foot single-machine automated lathe, as well as a disc scribing machine, an automatic disc drilling machine, etc. All these innovations have achieved significant results in improving production efficiency, saving labor, and reducing labor intensity.

The factory's young private-sector personnel took the lead in working hard for two days and nights to create three or four innovations, breaking the mystique of the "Four Modernizations" and increasing confidence. Private-sector masters also remained vigorous in their old age, participating in the hard work. Once, after working continuously for a period, the Party branch secretary repeatedly urged him to rest, but he insisted on working. Later, the Party branch secretary asked the chairman of the trade union to obey the leadership and go back to rest to lead others to leave work together, and the old master followed suit. Three female private-sector personnel in charge of the warehouse and general affairs had always thought they were not technical personnel and had been slow to move, but they were also swept into the torrent of the "Four Modernizations." Filled with enthusiasm, they actively participated in the work, sometimes searching for materials all night long, sometimes not even having time for lunch. When working hard at night, they voluntarily returned to the factory to deliver tea and midnight snacks. Even a rightist, due to the education of the Party and the organization and the driving force of the situation, transformed himself and designed a threading machine. All private-sector personnel, regardless of whether they had technology or not, regardless of gender, age, or youth, worked together and actively threw themselves into the "Four Modernizations," completing the twenty-one "Four Modernizations" projects proposed by private-sector personnel together with the workers, greatly saving labor and increasing productivity. Therefore, they were praised by the enterprise's Party committee. Of course, our transformation is progressing with ups and downs, but in the "Four Modernizations" movement, every private-sector member of the factory has performed well in service, which is gratifying.

What is the experience of promoting every private-sector member of the Jianguo Factory to make achievements in the "Four Modernizations" movement?

First of all, it is fundamentally important to rely closely on the enterprise's Party organization and work together with the workers. After the "Four Modernizations" movement was launched vigorously, the Party convened a forum for private-sector personnel, showing concern for our understanding of the movement. Based on our situation, which included both a willingness to participate in the movement and a fear of being tense, encouragement and education were given. Addressing the incorrect thinking that workers could make mistakes without problems, but we would be held responsible if we made mistakes, the branch secretary gave sincere education and told them: As long as it is for the "Four Modernizations," the branch will be responsible for mistakes, and shortcomings are inevitable in new things, so we can do and improve simultaneously. When private-sector personnel did not know where to start, the head of the grassroots group of private-sector personnel in the enterprise took the initiative to report to the Party. The Party branch secretary told him not to divide the troops everywhere, but to concentrate on breaking through five weak links, which would have a great effect. After the Party put forward the call to see results in three days and success in five days according to objective requirements, several private-sector personnel who mastered technology felt that they were not familiar with the "Four Modernizations" at all, and the time was short, so they had no confidence. The Party branch secretary personally led several private-sector personnel with strong confidence and the staff to work hard together for forty-six hours to make a sharp-axis single-machine automated lathe, using facts to educate them and increase their confidence. Some private-sector personnel were unwilling to work with the workers; one was afraid of losing face if they made mistakes, and the other was afraid that the success would be attributed to the workers. Under the guidance of this wrong thinking, a private-sector master was manufacturing a pneumatic tightening device. Because the air intake position was not correct, repeated tests failed. At first, he had pessimistic and disappointed thoughts. The Party discovered this in time and encouraged him, while also giving criticism and education, and pointed out that he should take the initiative to consult with the workers. As a result, the workers suggested changing the air intake angle to achieve success. As the movement moved forward, new difficulties came, and the Party immediately proposed: We will provide materials if you need them, time if you need it, and assistants if you need them, giving everyone great support and encouragement. All of the above fully demonstrates that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental reason why the grassroots organization of private-sector personnel in the factory can play a role.

Secondly, our grassroots organizations often report to the Party the ideological situation, work plans, and difficulties encountered by private-sector personnel, and after obtaining the Party's instructions, actively and proactively carry out political and ideological work. After the movement was launched, this grassroots organization encountered a difficult hurdle, that is, the private-sector personnel had the incorrect thinking of "no technology, no prospects." In response to this situation, the grassroots organization actively promoted members to participate in the city's two-session organized experience exchange meeting on vigorously developing services throughout the city, and also organized visits, making full use of the favorable situation to promote, so that members were educated and increased their confidence. The group also introduced the vivid deeds of a private-sector member without technology from another factory who attended the city's two-session experience exchange meeting, but made achievements in his work, to inspire her. At the same time, based on this situation, the entire grassroots group formulated plans, organized divisions of labor, and cooperated with each other, with those with technology leading those without technology, taking care of each person's characteristics and making everyone able to give full play to their strengths, so that everyone felt that they had a future and a responsibility. The grassroots group also focused on both ends, on the one hand, forming an active core, and on the other hand, conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological work on individual laggards. For example, for a female private-sector member whose husband had died, the method of recollection and comparison was used to enlighten her, so that she could recognize that today widows are not bullied, and are like in a warm family, receiving the care and arrangements of the organization, so that she understands that there is socialism today. She was moved and expressed that she would work actively. Because the grassroots organization can carry out in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work while approaching the Party, this is also a major factor in obtaining achievements.

We summarized the experience of all private-sector personnel of the Jianguo Factory giving full play to their enthusiasm for the "Four Modernizations," and immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote it. All those who participated in the on-site meeting returned full of confidence and, under the leadership of the Party, promoted all private-sector personnel in their units to make greater achievements than the private-sector personnel of the Jianguo Factory. For more than a year, under the leadership of the Party, our two associations have held 1,271 large and small individual service and transformation experience exchange meetings, with 57,356 participants, and the results are significant. When the exchange meetings were first opened, it was difficult to find a few typical figures, but as more exchange meetings were held, there were more advanced figures in service and transformation. In 1959, private-sector personnel who were rated as various advanced producers reached 5,200, an increase of 85% compared with 1958. Of course, the achievements are obtained in many ways, but this is the main one. Therefore, we must continue to regularly convene those individual experience exchange meetings in the future, but from this exchange based on the successful work experience of a grassroots organization, we have a new inspiration, that is, in the future, we must vigorously cultivate more advanced grassroots organizations, and through the activities of various grassroots organizations, mobilize the enthusiasm of every private-sector member.

Now, after our two associations convened a forum for private-sector personnel by the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to introduce the experience of the Jianguo Factory, we also convened a city-wide grassroots organization work conference to encourage everyone to learn from the experience of the Jianguo Factory. We firmly believe that under the strong leadership of the Party, the organizations of the two associations will inevitably have more units catch up with or exceed the achievements of the Jianguo Factory, and achieve a more planned and comprehensive promotion of the industrial and commercial circles to make greater achievements in service and transformation.

### 做好基层工作　加强自我改造  梁尚立委员的发言

    做好基层工作　加强自我改造
    梁尚立委员的发言
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    在这里我向大家汇报广州市民建会和工商联如何在党的领导下推动一个企业的成员依靠企业党委，发挥工商小组作用，推动成员投身“四化”运动的一些体会，请委员们批评指正。
    建国风动工具厂是一个公私合营厂，企业的私方二十六人，大部分有一定的技术，他们在大跃进、增产节约运动中作出过一定成绩，这次厂号召大搞“四化”，工人纷纷用实际行动响应号召，全厂职工在党领导下作出了辉煌的成绩，并形成热火朝天的你追我赶的“四化”高潮，私方人员跟着动起来，几天内提了大量的建议，并和工人一道苦战三昼夜完成了十项机械改进和制造，单是老轴单机自动化车床一项已提高生产率二十五倍，管接头机自动化车床提高了生产率十五倍。一个年青的私方与工人一齐动手搞了一部活动吊车，又安全又快捷，过去六至八人整天的活，现在半小时就解决了。又设计了辘丝机用二台车床代替了二十台车床，党总支初步计算一年提高生产价值四十万元，提高生产率几十倍，一个私方的车间主任，设计自动反轴钻床一人可看几十台，提高生产率三十倍，还有搞出了三套划线的专用夹件，提高了工作效率和划一了产品规格，又在职工的帮助支持下，试制成功了自动攻丝机和车夹头，接着又参加设计和制造了四点六尺单机自动化车床，以及圆盘划线机，自动圆盘钻孔机等，这一切的革新对提高生产效率、节约劳动力和减轻劳动强度等方面都取得不少的成绩。
    该厂年青的私方人员带头苦战两日两夜就搞出了三四项革新，打破了对“四化”的神秘观念，增强了信心，私方师傅也老当益壮一起参加苦战，有一次连续苦战了一段时期，党支书多次催促他休息，他仍坚持工作，后来党支书要工会主席服从领导回去休息带动其他人一同下班，这位老师傅才跟着下去。厂里搞仓库及总务的三个女私方，一向认为自己不是技术人员，迟迟未动，也被卷入“四化”的洪流中，热情洋溢的主动参加工作，有时通宵达旦去找材料，有时连午饭都来不及吃，晚上苦战时，她们主动回厂送茶水，备夜餐，一个右派分子也由于党和组织对他们的教育和形势推动，有所转变而设计了辘丝机。全体私方人员不论有技术，没有技术，不分男、女、老、青都一齐动手个个积极投身“四化”同工人一道完成了私方人员提出的二十一项“四化”工程，大大的节省劳动力，提高生产率，因此，受到企业党委表扬，当然我们的改造是前进中有反复的，但在“四化”运动中该厂每一个私方人员都在服务中有好的表现，这是值得高兴的。
    推动建国厂每一个私方人员都在“四化”运动中作出成绩的经验是什么呢？
    首先是紧密依靠企业党组织，与工人结合起来一齐动手，这是根本的根本。“四化”运动轰轰烈烈展开后，党召开了私方人员座谈会，关怀我们对运动的情况，根据我们对运动既有愿意搞的一面，又有怕紧张的一面的情况，给予鼓励和教育。对认为工人做错了没有问题，我们搞错了责任难当的不正确思想，支书就以诚恳的态度给予教育，并对他们说：只要是为了“四化”做错了由支部负责，而且新生事物缺点难免，可以边做边改。当私方人员不知从何下手的时候，企业的私方人员基层小组长就主动的向党汇报，党支书告诉他不要处处分兵，要集中力量攻破五个薄弱环节，效果必大。党根据客观的要求提出三天见效，五天成功的号召后，掌握技术的几个私方，认为对“四化”全不熟，时间又急速，毫无信心，党支书就亲自带领几个信心强的私方与职工一同苦战四十六小时，做出一台尖轴单机自动化车床，用事实教育了他们，增加了信心，又有一些私方有不愿跟工人一道搞的思想；一是错了丢脸；二是怕成功时入了工人账，在这错误思想指导下，一个私方老师傅在制造风动旋紧器，由于进风位不合，屡试都失败，开始有悲观失望的思想，党及时发觉，对他进行了鼓励，同时也给予批评教育，并指出他应主动去找工人商量，结果工人提出了改变进风角度才获得成功。运动向前发展，新的困难又来了，党马上提出：要材料有材料，要时间有时间，要助手有助手，给大家很大支持与鼓励。以上这一切都充分体验党的领导是该厂的私方人员基层组织能够发挥作用的根本原因。
    其次，我们的基层组织经常把私方人员的思想情况，工作计划，及遇到什么困难等问题向党汇报、请示，取得党的指示后，又积极主动进行政治思想工作，当运动展开后，这个基层就遇到一个难关，就是私方人员存在“无技术，无搞头”的不正确思想，针对这情况基层组织就积极推动成员参加市两会组织的全市大搞服务的经验交流会，同时，组织了参观，这样充分利用有利的形势来推动，使成员受到教育，增强了信心，小组还介绍别厂出席市两会经验交流会的一位无技术的私方但在工作中作出成绩的生动事迹启发她，同时根据这种情况进行推动整个基层组订出规划，组织分工，互相合作，有技术的带没有技术的，既照顾各人的特点，又使每个人都能发挥所长，使每个人都感到有奔头，有责任，基层组还抓两头，一方面把积极的组成核心，一方面对个别后进的进行深入细致的思想工作，如对死去丈夫的女私方，用回忆对比方法，启发她认识，今天寡妇不受欺，像在一个温暖的大家庭，受到组织的照顾安排，使她懂得有社会主义才有今天，她感动了表示要积极工作。由于基层组织能在靠拢党的同时，进行深入细致的政治思想工作，这也是获得成绩的一个主要因素。
    我们总结了建国厂全体私方人员都发挥了对“四化”积极性的经验，便立刻召开了现场会议，加以推广。凡参加了现场会议的都满怀信心回去在党的领导下，推动单位的所有私方人员，作出比建国厂私方人员更大的成绩，一年多以来，在党的领导下，我们两会开了一千二百七十一次大大小小的个人服务与改造经验的交流会，参加的人数有五万七千三百五十六人次，收效是大的。初开交流会时，要找几个典型人物也觉得难，交流会多了，服务与改造的先进人物就多了。1959年私方人员被评为各类先进生产者的达五千二百多人次，较1958年增加85％。当然成绩的取得是多方面的，但这是主要的一条，因此，我们今后还要继续经常召开那些个人经验的交流会，但从这次以一个基层组织的成功的工作经验来交流，给我们一个新的启发，就是今后要大力培养更多的先进基层组织，通过各个基层组织的活动把每一个私方人员的积极性都调动起来。
    现在，我们两会在中共广州市委召开私方人员座谈会，介绍建国厂经验之后，又召开了全市基层组织工作会议，鼓励大家学习建国厂的经验，我们深信在党的坚强领导下，两会组织必然能够有更多的单位赶上或超过建国厂的成绩，实现更有计划，更全面的推动工商界，在服务与改造中作出更大的成绩。
