Nationwide Coal Mines Promote Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation
Actual Coal Mining Time Increases, Achieving Balanced and Sustained High Output, Workers Enjoy a Better Work-Rest Balance

(Our report) To meet the needs of high-speed development in coal production, a major revolution in production organization is underway in coal mining enterprises nationwide. From October of last year to the present, over 1,400 coal mining faces and over 2,800 tunneling faces in 54 key coal mines across the country have implemented the four-shift, eight-hour cross-operation system, accounting for over 80% and 60% of the total mining and tunneling faces in these enterprises, respectively. Among them, 14 coal mines, including Jingxi, Fushun, Pingxiang, and Lu'an, have fully implemented the "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation" system. In terms of basic construction of underground roadway engineering, 64% of the tunneling faces have also adopted this advanced production organization form.

The advanced experience of "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation" was created by the workers of the Fengfeng, Zibo, and Yangquan coal mines during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After summarizing this experience, the Ministry of Coal Industry believes that this new organizational form is perfectly suited to the characteristics of coal mine production, which includes underground operations, a single product, multiple tools, multiple occupations, multiple processes, and the continuous forward movement of the workplace. Its advantages are concentrated in the following five aspects: First, it can fully utilize space and time, maximize equipment efficiency, and achieve balanced and sustained high output over a large area. Second, it can better achieve production with a balance between work and rest, improve workers' health, and promote the development of the cultural revolution. Third, it can further promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and improve enterprise management. Fourth, it is safer for production, saves pit props, and can reduce costs. Fifth, it can promote the communist spirit of cooperation among workers and strengthen unity between shifts.

In the past, coal mine production in our country generally involved three shifts. This meant either two shifts of coal mining and one shift of preparation, or three shifts of mixed operations, with each shift both mining coal and doing preparatory work. The main shortcomings of this organizational form were: excessively long shift handover times, easy disconnection between preparation processes and coal mining processes, inefficient use of equipment and working hours, and frequent interruptions in production. The "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation" system, based on the original equipment and labor force, changes three shifts into four shifts, with each shift still working eight hours, and each shift having two hours of cross-operation with another shift. When the previous shift has worked for six hours, the next shift of workers enters the working face, extracts coal together with the previous shift, and prepares for the next shift's coal extraction, such as support, roof caving, and moving the electric conveyor. In this way, the parallel cross-operation time between various jobs and processes is increased, eliminating the production interruptions and disconnections that existed in the past three-shift system, and ensuring that each shift can complete the production tasks on schedule and in a balanced manner.

Since the implementation of this advanced production organization form in various mines, the coal mining time of the working faces has increased from the original 16 hours to about 20 hours per day; output has increased by 10% to 20%; coal miner efficiency has increased by 10% to 30%; production costs have decreased by 10% to 15%; and tunneling progress has accelerated by about 10%. Due to the acceleration of mining and tunneling, and balanced production, the past phenomenon of overtime work due to failure to complete tasks has been avoided, and the time for workers to rest and participate in study and recreational activities has relatively increased. Workers praised the "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation" saying: "High utilization of work hours, elimination of wasted work time, great development of cultural entertainment, high enthusiasm with work and rest."

The promotion of "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation" has also promoted the technical innovation movement and enterprise management work in various mines. For example, in the process of promoting "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation," the Fushun Shengli Mine found that six processes, such as filling, blasting, and coal loading, took too long, and mobilized the masses to adopt more than ten advanced technical experiences, which generally increased the efficiency of each process by one-third to three times.

In response to a series of changes caused by the implementation of "Four-Shift, Eight-Hour Cross-Operation," mines such as Fuxin and Yangquan promptly improved wage work, strengthened leadership and unified dispatching in the forefront of production, and brought enterprise management to a new level.

### 全国煤矿推行四八交叉作业  实际采煤时间增加　均衡持续高产　工人更能有劳有逸

    全国煤矿推行四八交叉作业
    实际采煤时间增加　均衡持续高产　工人更能有劳有逸
    本报讯　适应煤炭生产高速度发展的需要，全国煤矿企业正在进行一次生产组织的大革命。从去年10月到目前为止，全国五十四个重点煤矿已有一千四百多个采煤工作面和二千八百多个掘进工作面推行了四（班）、八（小时）交叉作业，各占这些企业采掘工作面总数的80％和60％以上。其中京西、抚顺、萍乡、潞安等十四个煤矿，已经全部实行了“四八交叉作业”。在基本建设的井巷工程方面，也已经有64％的掘进工作面推广了这一先进的生产组织形式。
    “四八交叉作业”这一先进经验，是峰峰、淄博、阳泉三个煤矿的职工在1958年大跃进中创造的。煤炭工业部总结后认为，这种新的组织形式完全适合煤矿生产地下作业、产品单一、多工具、多工种、多工序和工作场所不断向前推移的特点。它的优越性集中表现在以下五个方面：一、可以充分利用空间和时间，发挥设备效能，做到均衡持续的大面积高产；二、可以更好地实现有劳有逸地进行生产，增进工人身体健康，促进文化革命的发展；三、可以进一步促进技术革新和技术革命运动，提高企业管理水平；四、生产安全，节约坑木，并能降低成本；五、可以发扬工人的共产主义协作精神，加强班同班之间的团结。
    过去我国煤矿生产一般都是三班作业，不是两班采煤一班准备，就是三班混合作业，各班既采煤又做准备工作。这种组织形式的主要缺点是：交接班时间过长，准备工序和采煤工序之间容易脱节，设备、工时不能充分利用，生产经常中断。“四八交叉作业”是在原有设备和劳动力的基础上，将三班改成四班，各班工作时间仍为八小时，每班有两个小时同另一班交叉作业。在上一班工作到六小时的时候，下一班工人就进入工作面，和上一班一同出煤，并做好支柱、放顶、移电溜子等下一班出煤的准备工作。这样，就使各工种和工序之间增加了不少平行交叉作业时间，消灭了过去三班作业时存在的生产中断及相互脱节现象，保证各班能够按期均衡地完成生产任务。
    各矿自从推行这一先进的生产组织形式以来，工作面的采煤时间都从原来每天十六小时增加到二十小时左右；产量提高了10％到20％；采煤工效率提高10％到30％；生产成本降低10％到15％；掘进进度加快10％左右。由于采掘加快，生产均衡，避免了过去有时因完不成任务而发生的加班加点的现象，相对地增加了工人休息和参加学习及文娱活动的时间。工人们歌颂“四八交叉作业”说：“工时利用高，窝工消灭了，文化娱乐大开展，有劳有逸干劲高。”
    推广“四八交叉作业”，还推动了各矿的技术革新运动和企业管理工作。如抚顺胜利矿在推行“四八交叉作业”过程中，发现充填、放炮、攉煤等六个工序占用的时间过长，便发动群众采用了十多项先进技术经验，使各工序效率普遍提高了三分之一到三倍。
    阜新、阳泉等矿针对推行“四八交叉作业”后引起的一系列变化，及时改进了工资工作，加强了对生产第一线的领导和统一调度，使企业管理也达到了一个新的水平。（附图片）
