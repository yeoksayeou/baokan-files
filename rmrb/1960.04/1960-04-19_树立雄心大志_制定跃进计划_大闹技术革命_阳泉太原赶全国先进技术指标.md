Establish Lofty Aspirations, Formulate Leap Forward Plans, Vigorously Engage in Technical Revolution
Yangquan and Taiyuan Catch Up with National Advanced Technical Indicators

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 18th dispatch) In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, put forward the slogan of marching towards advanced indicators. By the end of March, 86 technical and economic indicators in the city had respectively caught up with or surpassed the advanced levels of the nation, the province, and the Jinzhong Special District. At the end of last December, only six indicators in the city had reached the national advanced level. In the first quarter of this year, the production level rose sharply, with the average daily output increasing by 20.18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

In mid-December of last year, after Yangquan City overfulfilled the annual plan ahead of schedule, the Municipal Party Committee issued a fighting call to the city's workers: "Work hard, strive for the top, and march towards advanced technical and economic indicators!" The workers of various factories and mines vowed not to lag behind, and after extensive discussions and proposing measures, they formulated plans to march towards advanced technical and economic indicators. According to statistics, the city proposed, and the Municipal Party Committee approved, 157 projects for striving for national top-level indicators in 1960, 134 provincial top-level indicators, and 13 Jinzhong Special District top-level indicators.

The activities of catching up with the advanced, striving for the top, and marching towards advanced technical and economic indicators have enriched the content of socialist competition and clarified the goals of endeavor. After learning about the advanced levels of the nation, the province, and the special district and their own levels, the workers have broadened their horizons and gained more confidence. They then determined specific targets to learn from, catch up with, and surpass, and formulated specific plans to achieve them in stages and batches. For example, the converter equipment of the Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant was newly built, and the technology was not yet up to par. This time, their goal was to first catch up with the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant in terms of converter utilization coefficient, and then catch up with the national advanced unit, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. When selecting the advanced level for each indicator, various factories and mines strived to comprehensively catch up with the advanced in all indicators, learning from whichever unit was advanced in whichever aspect.

The activities of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and surpassing greatly promoted the progress of technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, in order to make various indicators catch up with the advanced level as soon as possible, the Shandie Iron Plant first carried out some technical renovations on the blast furnace. With the sharp increase in pig iron production, 18 links such as ore crushing, coke crushing, transportation, and slag disposal could not keep up, making the production level unstable. In this situation, they concentrated the suggestions of the masses and made a comprehensive innovation plan of "one change" and "18-izations" for major key problems. They also adopted the method of the secretary taking responsibility for the overall situation, committee members contracting specific lines, Party members contracting specific points, and relying on the masses to make a 20-day blitz, greatly improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, saving 17% of labor and ensuring the stable rise of daily production level. The utilization coefficient of large and small blast furnaces in the whole plant reached the advanced level in the province. The experience of this plant in closely combining technical innovation and technical revolution with high-speed catching up with the advanced was discovered, summarized and promoted by the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee. After this, various factories and mines, according to the plan of catching up with the advanced in various technical and economic indicators, made a comprehensive technical innovation plan, and then found the key problems that had the greatest impact on production from the plan, launched a mass movement in a big way, and made a concentrated effort to achieve it, shortening the time to catch up with the advanced and greatly accelerating the pace of technical innovation.

"Striving for initiative and striving for the top in everything" is the new mental state of the vast number of cadres and workers in Yangquan City since they launched the movement to march towards advanced technical and economic indicators. Under the guidance of this new spiritual outlook, the workers have explored the experience of focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month and focusing on preparations in the last ten days of the month, ensuring the stable rise of production.

At present, the mass movement of Yangquan City marching towards advanced technical and economic indicators is developing in depth. According to their own production characteristics, the workers in various industries have grasped the main indicators to drive the common improvement of various indicators. For example, the smelting department uses the utilization coefficient as the key and puts forward specific requirements for catching up and surpassing for large, medium and small blast furnaces respectively, so as to drive various indicators such as coke ratio and pig iron qualified rate to catch up with the advanced level.

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 18th dispatch) In the mass movement of the Taiyuan City industrial front marching towards national advanced technical and economic indicators, many relatively backward technical and economic indicators have rapidly risen to the national advanced level. At the end of last year, only 11 indicators from six units in Taiyuan City reached the national advanced technical and economic indicator level. The movement to catch up with advanced technical and economic indicators has been carried out for only three months, and 70 major technical and economic indicators of 62 of the city's 68 larger enterprises have caught up with or surpassed the national advanced level. Among them, many indicators have caught up with or surpassed the national advanced level on average throughout the city.

Taiyuan City's movement to catch up with national advanced indicators is carried out in a planned and organized manner. At the beginning of the year, after the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee issued the call to march towards advanced technical and economic indicators, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee made a resolution to "strive to catch up with or surpass the national advanced level at high speed in major technical and economic indicators." Then, various factories and mines in the city widely mobilized the masses and compared with advanced units and advanced indicators in the same industry across the country. On the basis of finding advanced objects and measures, they formulated specific plans to catch up with the national advanced level on schedule and according to indicator items. Various factories and mines have plans, workshops have requirements, teams have topics, and individuals have goals. In order to catch up with the national advanced level at high speed, many factories and mines, in addition to summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of the city, also organized visiting groups to visit and learn from Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and other provinces and cities, as well as Yangquan City, Shanxi Province. From factories to workshops, work sections, teams, and even every worker, a wave of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing swept the city. Various units have carried out technical revolution in a big way around the weak links in the current production. Various factories and mines have manufactured 110,000 pieces of mechanical equipment targeting cumbersome manual operations and heavy physical labor such as loading and unloading, forging, and casting. In order to ensure that these mechanical equipment are applied to production in a timely manner, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee has also organized more than ten city-wide martial arts training and competition activities according to industry and type of work. Through mass comparison and evaluation, the new machinery has been quickly integrated and rapidly improved the production level.

    树立雄心大志　制定跃进计划　大闹技术革命
    阳泉太原赶全国先进技术指标
    本报太原18日电　在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，山西省阳泉市提出了向先进指标进军的口号。到3月底止，全市已有八十六项技术经济指标分别赶上或超过了全国、全省、全晋中专区的先进水平。而去年12月底，全市达到全国先进水平的只有六项指标。今年第一季度生产水平直线上升，平均日产水平比去年第四季度提高20.18％。
    去年12月中旬，阳泉市提前超额完成了全年计划后，市委便向全市职工发出了“鼓干劲、争上游，向先进技术经济指标进军”的战斗号召。各厂矿职工誓不后人，经过广泛讨论、提措施，制订出向先进技术经济指标进军的规划。据统计，全市提出，并经市委审查批准的1960年争取全国上游指标的项目达一百五十七项，全省上游指标一百三十四项，全晋中专区上游指标十三项。
    赶先进、争上游、向先进技术经济指标进军的活动，使社会主义竞赛的内容更加丰富了，努力的目标更加明确了。职工们了解了全国、全省、全专区的先进水平和自己的水平以后，眼界更加开阔，心中更加有底；接着便纷纷确定学、赶、超的具体对象，并制订出分期、分批实现的具体计划。例如：阳泉钢铁厂的转炉设备是新建的，技术没有过关。这次，他们努力的目标，第一步要在转炉利用系数方面赶上长治钢铁厂，第二步赶全国先进单位石景山钢铁厂。各个厂矿在挑选每项指标的先进水平时，都力争各项指标全面赶上先进，哪一个单位哪一项先进，就学哪个单位。
    学、比、赶、超的活动，大大推动了技术革新和技术革命的进度。如山底铁厂为了使各项指标尽快赶上先进水平，他们首先对高炉进行了部分的技术改造。随着生铁产量的猛烈增加，碎矿、碎焦、运输、倒渣等十八个环节却跟不上去，使生产水平不能稳定。在这种情况下，他们集中了群众的建议，针对重大关键作出“一改”“十八化”的全面革新计划；并且采取了书记包面、委员包干线、党员包点、依靠群众的办法，突击了二十天，机械化、半机械化程度大大提高，节省劳力17％，保证了日产水平稳定上升。全厂大小高炉利用系数达到全省先进水平。这个厂把技术革新和技术革命同高速度赶先进紧密结合起来的经验，由中共阳泉市委发现和总结推广以后，各厂矿根据各项技术经济指标赶上先进的规划，作出全面的技术革新计划，然后从计划中找出对生产作用最大的关键问题，大搞群众运动，一鼓作气，突击实现，缩短了赶先进的时间，也大大加快了技术革新的步伐。
      “事事争主动、争上游”是阳泉市广大干部和工人开展向先进技术经济指标进军以来新的精神状态。在这种新的精神面貌的指导下，职工们摸索出上中两旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备的经验，保证了生产的稳定上升。
    目前，阳泉市向先进技术经济指标进军的群众运动正向纵深发展。各行业职工根据本身生产特点，抓住主要指标带动各项指标共同提高。如冶炼部门以利用系数为纲对大、中、小型高炉分别提出具体赶、超要求，以此带动焦比、生铁合格率等各项指标都赶上先进水平。
    本报太原18日电　太原市工业战线在向全国先进技术经济指标进军的群众运动中，许多比较落后的技术经济指标，迅速提高到了全国先进水平。去年年底，太原市赶上全国先进技术经济指标水平的只有六个单位的十一项指标。追赶先进技术经济指标的运动开展仅仅三个月，全市的六十八个较大企业中就有六十二个企业的七十项主要技术经济指标，赶上或超过全国先进水平。其中，许多指标是全市平均赶上或超过了全国先进水平。
    太原市的赶全国先进指标运动是有规划、有组织地进行的。年初，中共山西省委发出向先进技术经济指标进军的号召以后，中共太原市委作出了“力争主要技术经济指标高速度地赶上或超过全国先进水平”的决议。接着，全市各厂矿企业广泛发动群众和全国同产业的先进单位、先进指标比较，在找先进对象和措施的基础上制订出按期、按指标项目赶上全国先进水平的具体规划。各厂矿企业有规划，车间有要求，小组有课题，个人有目标。为了高速度地赶上全国先进水平，许多厂矿除总结推广本市的先进经验外，并组织参观团到河南、河北、山东、安徽等省市以及山西省阳泉市参观学习。从厂到车间、工段、小组，以至每个工人，学、赶、超的热潮席卷全市。各单位都围绕着当前生产中的薄弱环节大搞技术革命。各厂矿企业针对装卸、锻压、铸造等繁琐手工操作和笨重体力劳动，制造出十一万件机械设备。为了使这些机械设备都及时应用到生产中去，中共太原市委又按行业、工种组织了十多次全市性的练武、比武活动，通过群众性的比较、鉴定，使新机械尽速配套成龙，迅速提高了生产水平。
