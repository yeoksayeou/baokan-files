    Fraternal Countries Hold Grand Rallies to Solemnly Commemorate the 90th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 22nd: The Moscow City Party Committee, the Soviet and social organizations solemnly held a rally today in the Moscow Sports Palace to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    More than 100,000 people attended the meeting: workers from Moscow enterprises and construction sites, collective farmers from the suburbs of Moscow, people from the scientific and cultural circles, soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy, and youth.
    Leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, and old Bolsheviks who worked with Lenin attended the commemoration meeting.
    Suslov, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee, presided over the opening of the meeting.
    Kuusinen, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee, made a report.
    Bulgaria
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 21st: The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the National Committee of the Fatherland Front, the National Committee of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association, the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Sofia City People's Council held a grand rally tonight at the People's Opera House to solemnly commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, Ganev, and others attended the rally.
    Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries stationed here were also invited to attend the rally.
    Staikov, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, made a report at the meeting.
    When discussing Leninism's idea of peaceful coexistence, Staikov said that the frantic resistance of the cold war supporters should not be underestimated. They are doing everything possible to oppose the easing of the international situation. The people of all countries must not relax their vigilance and must be ready to fight back against the imperialist instigators of new wars at any time. He said that the policy of peaceful coexistence does not mean abandoning or weakening the ideological struggle in the slightest.
    Hungary
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 21st: The working people of Budapest held a grand rally on the afternoon of the 21st to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    The conference was jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the National Council of the Hungarian Patriotic People's Front, the Central Council of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.
    Hungarian party and government leaders Kadar, Münnich, and others, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Hungary, attended the commemoration meeting.
    Münnich, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Premier of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, delivered a report on commemorating Lenin's birthday at the meeting. In his report, he said that Lenin has been dead for thirty-six years, but Lenin's ideas still live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of ordinary people. He said that Lenin's unwavering struggle to creatively apply Marxism against revisionism and dogmatism, to fight for proletarian internationalism against nationalism, and to fight for Party spirit against bourgeois objectivism is still an example for every communist today.
    Münnich pointed out that Lenin applied the theories of Marx and Engels to the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution and continued to develop them. He armed the Russian and international workers' movement with the theory and strategy of socialist revolution suitable for the relations of the imperialist era and drafted a program for building socialism. He said that Hungary’s economic, political, and cultural achievements, and the development of socialism internationally, tell us that the history of this century has proven Lenin’s brilliant predictions in all aspects.
    He also said that the course of history has fully confirmed Lenin’s scientific predictions: large areas of Asia have been liberated from imperialist rule, and today we are witnesses to the awakening of Africa. In Central and South America, the land under the feet of imperialism has also begun to boil.
    Münnich continued that although the current conditions are conducive to peace, we cannot ignore the "Cold War" forces. We must continue to be vigilant and not allow warmongers to play with fire.
    Münnich finally said that the Soviet Union and the socialist world system have become an invincible force. In history, there has never been a more mass-appealing ideology than Marxism-Leninism, nor an ideology that has been more attacked by enemies than Marxism-Leninism. However, Leninism finally won in the struggle because it is the true doctrine, and it correctly expresses the interests of all working people in the world. Marxism-Leninism is invincible, just as the workers' movement closely connected with Marxism-Leninism is invincible.
    After the report, a grand performance was held.
    German Democratic Republic
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 21st: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the Greater Berlin City Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party held a mass meeting on the 21st in Berlin, attended by 3,000 people, to solemnly commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, led by Ulbricht, attended the meeting.
    Honecker, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that the characteristic of the great transformative process of our century is the unprecedented victory of Marxist-Leninist thought. Lenin's doctrine on the role of the working-class party in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution has stood the test. Today, the people of all countries in the world are commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth under favorable circumstances.
    Honecker talked about West German militarists relying on American financial capital to carry out atomic rearmament and pursue revanchist policies.
    Honecker said that the German Socialist Unity Party has always been guided by Lenin's doctrine on socialist and communist construction in the struggle for the victory of socialism. When he talked about the great achievement of the complete collectivization of agriculture recently achieved by the German Democratic Republic, he pointed out that, as Lenin said, we are now standing on socialist land with both feet, thus decisively strengthening the strength and indestructibility of the German Democratic Republic.
    He finally called on people to further study Marxism-Leninism, pointing out that this is a task.
    After Honecker's report, a documentary film about Lenin's struggle and life after the October Revolution was shown.
    Invited to attend the commemoration meeting were diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, General Yakubovsky, commander of the Soviet Armed Forces in Germany, and a delegation from the British Communist Party headed by General Secretary Gollan.
    Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 21st: People from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a meeting at the National Art Theater tonight to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    The meeting was attended by Korean Workers' Party and Republic government leaders such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Il, Park Jung-ae, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, and Nam Il, as well as Soviet Ambassador to Korea Puzanov and envoys from various countries stationed in Korea.
    Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that Lenin carried out an uncompromising struggle against revisionists and various opportunists, not only inheriting and defending Marxism, but also comprehensively developing it under new historical conditions.
    Choi Yong-kun said that US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Korean people and that it is US imperialism that threatens Korea and the Far East. The Korean people must maintain high vigilance and smash all its conspiracy provocations. Choi Yong-kun said that the colonial system of imperialism is rapidly collapsing and that imperialism is facing a total crisis. Lenin's predictions have come true.
    Choi Yong-kun said that the Korean Workers' Party has always been loyal to Lenin's principles. We must learn Lenin's doctrine, always be loyal to him, and fight like Lenin.
    Czechoslovakia
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 21st: The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Prague City Committee, and the Prague State Committee jointly held a meeting here tonight to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth. The meeting was attended by Czechoslovak Communist Party and government leaders Novotny, Dulansky, Barak, Kopetzky, Šimůnek and Fierlinger.
    Representatives of the Czechoslovak National Front and various mass organizations, as well as diplomatic envoys from various socialist countries stationed in Czechoslovakia, also attended the commemoration meeting.
    Hendrych, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that our Party, considering certain characteristics of the socialist revolution process in Czechoslovakia, has constantly emphasized that the question of regarding the dictatorship of the proletariat as the main means of eliminating the bourgeoisie as a class and building socialism is the cornerstone of Marxism-Leninism. Hendrych said that at a time when modern revisionists are launching a frantic attack on the communist movement, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has emphasized the importance of maintaining fraternal relations with the Soviet Union more emphatically. Hendrych said that while implementing and promoting Leninism's idea of peaceful coexistence, it is also necessary to refute and oppose the opportunist and revisionist distortion of the meaning and essence of the Leninist concept, which they do in order to seek class reconciliation.
    The reporter said that due to the strength of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp today possesses all the strength and means to stop any attempt at aggression directed against socialist countries. However, in the struggle for peace, no one has any reason to relax their vigilance. The fact that monopoly capital aggression groups are trying to strengthen rocket and weapon equipment and set up new troops within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization shows that advocates of implementing old policies in international relations are not willing to give up. They are doing everything possible to intensify the international situation.
    Hendrych finally emphasized that the solidarity between the Czechoslovak people and the fraternal people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is as solid as a rock. This is the guarantee of our certain victory in the future.

    兄弟国家分别举行盛大集会
    隆重纪念列宁诞生九十周年
    苏联
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：莫斯科市党、苏维埃和社会团体今天在莫斯科体育宫隆重举行列宁诞生九十周年纪念大会。
    出席大会的有十万多人：莫斯科各企业和工地的工人、莫斯科近郊的集体农民、科学文化界人士、苏联陆海军军人和青年。
    出席纪念会的，有苏联共产党和苏联政府领导人，同列宁一起工作过的老布尔什维克。
    苏共中央主席团委员、中央书记处书记苏斯洛夫主持大会开幕。
    苏共中央主席团委员、中央书记处书记库西宁作了报告。
    保加利亚
    新华社索非亚21日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会、祖国阵线全国委员会、保苏友好协会全国委员会、保加利亚共产党索非亚市委员会和索非亚市人民会议今晚在人民歌剧院举行盛大集会，隆重纪念列宁诞生九十周年。
    保加利亚共产党和政府领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、加涅夫等出席了大会。
    苏联和中国等国家驻这里的外交使节也应邀出席了大会。
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员斯塔伊科夫在会上作了报告。
    斯塔伊科夫在论述列宁主义的和平共处思想时说，不应当对冷战拥护者的疯狂反抗估计过低。他们千方百计地反对国际局势缓和。各国人民决不能放松警惕，要随时准备反击新战争的帝国主义煽动者。他说，和平共处政策丝毫也不意味着放弃或削弱思想意识的斗争。
    匈牙利
    新华社布达佩斯21日电　布达佩斯劳动人民21日下午举行盛大集会，纪念列宁诞生九十周年。
    大会是由匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、匈牙利爱国人民阵线全国委员会、工会中央理事会、共产主义青年团中央委员会联合组织的。
    匈牙利党政领导人卡达尔、明尼赫等，以及各国驻匈牙利的外交使节出席了纪念会。
    社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫在大会上作了关于纪念列宁诞辰的报告。他在报告中说，列宁逝世已经三十六年了，但是，列宁的思想仍然活在亿万普通人的心里。他说，列宁为争取创造性地运用马克思主义而反对修正主义以及教条主义，争取无产阶级国际主义而反对民族主义，争取党性而反对资产阶级客观主义所进行的始终不渝的斗争，今天仍然是每个共产党人的榜样。
    明尼赫指出，列宁把马克思、恩格斯的学说用于帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，并且继续发展了它。他以适合于帝国主义时代关系的社会主义革命理论和策略武装了俄国和国际的工人运动，拟订了建设社会主义的纲领。他说，不论匈牙利的经济、政治和文化成就，不论社会主义在国际上的发展，都告诉我们：本世纪的历史在一切方面都证明了列宁的英明预见。
    他又说，历史的进程完全证实了列宁的科学预见：亚洲的大片土地已从帝国主义的统治下解放出来，今天，我们是非洲觉醒的见证者。在中美和南美洲，帝国主义脚下的土地也已经沸腾起来了。
    明尼赫继续说，虽然目前的条件对和平有利，但是，我们也不能忽视“冷战”势力。我们必须继续提高警惕，不许战争狂人玩火。
    明尼赫最后说，苏联和社会主义世界体系已成为不可战胜的力量。在历史上从没有比马克思列宁主义更吸引群众的思想，也没有比马克思列宁主义更受敌人攻击的思想了。但是，列宁主义在斗争中终于取得了胜利，因为它是真正的学说，它正确表达了世界所有劳动者的利益。马克思列宁主义是不可战胜的，正如同马克思列宁主义紧密联系着的工人运动是不可战胜的一样。
    报告结束后，举行了盛大的演出。
    德意志民主共和国
    新华社柏林21日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会和德国统一社会党大柏林市委员会，21日晚在柏林举行了有三千人参加的群众大会，隆重纪念列宁诞生九十周年。
    以乌布利希为首的德国统一社会党中央政治局委员们出席了大会。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局委员昂纳克在会上作了报告。他说，我们世纪的巨大变革过程的特征，是马克思列宁主义思想获得空前的胜利。列宁关于工人阶级政党在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时期的作用的学说经受住了考验。今天，世界各国人民是在一个有利的形势下纪念列宁诞生九十周年的。
    昂纳克谈到了西德军国主义者依靠美国财政资本进行原子备战和执行复仇主义政策。
    昂纳克说，德国统一社会党在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，一贯以列宁关于社会主义和共产主义建设的学说为指导。他在谈到最近德意志民主共和国取得农业全部合作化的伟大成就时指出，这正如列宁所说的，我们现在已经两只脚站在社会主义土地上，这样，德意志民主共和国的力量和不可摧毁性就有了决定性的加强。
    他最后号召进一步学习马克思列宁主义，指出这是一项任务。
    在昂纳克报告结束后，放映了有关列宁在十月革命后的斗争和生活的文献纪录片。
    应邀出席这个纪念大会的有：苏联、中国和其他国家的外交使节，苏联驻德武装部队司令雅库鲍夫斯基大将和以总书记高兰为首的英国共产党代表团。
    朝鲜
    新华社平壤21日电　平壤各界今天晚上在国立艺术剧场举行了纪念列宁诞辰九十周年大会。
    参加大会的有：金日成、金一、朴正爱、金昌满、郑一龙、南日等朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导人，还有苏联驻朝鲜大使普扎诺夫和各国驻朝鲜使节。
    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔镛健在会上作了报告。他说，列宁同修正主义者和各种机会主义者作了不妥协的斗争，不仅继承和保卫了马克思主义，并在新的历史条件下全面发展了它。
    崔镛健说，美帝国主义是朝鲜人民不共戴天的敌人，威胁着朝鲜和远东的就是美帝国主义，朝鲜人民要保持高度警惕性，粉碎它的一切挑衅阴谋。崔镛健说，帝国主义的殖民主义体系正在迅速崩溃，帝国主义正面临着总危机，列宁的预言实现了。
    崔镛健说，朝鲜劳动党一贯忠于列宁的原则。我们要学习列宁的学说，永远忠实于他，并像列宁那样去战斗。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    新华社布拉格21日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、布拉格市委员会和布拉格州委员会今晚在这里联合举行列宁诞生九十周年纪念会。出席会议的，有捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府领导人诺沃提尼、杜兰斯基、巴拉克、柯别茨基、西穆涅克和费林格。
    捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线和各群众团体的代表以及各社会主义国家驻捷克斯洛伐克的外交使节也参加了纪念会。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员和书记处书记亨德里赫在会上作了报告。他说，我们的党考虑到捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义革命过程的某些特点，不断强调指出，关于把无产阶级专政作为消灭资产阶级这个阶级以及建设社会主义的主要手段的问题是马克思列宁主义的基石。亨德里赫说，在现代修正主义者对共产主义运动进行疯狂进攻的时候，捷克斯洛伐克共产党更强调地着重指出了同苏联保持兄弟关系的重要意义。亨德里赫说，在实行和宣传列宁主义和平共处的思想的同时，还必须驳斥和反对机会主义、修正主义对列宁概念的含义和实质的歪曲，他们这样做是为了谋求阶级调和。
    报告人说，由于苏联的强大，社会主义阵营今天已经拥有一切力量和手段来制止矛头指向社会主义国家的任何侵略尝试。可是，在争取和平的斗争中，任何人都没有理由放松警惕。垄断资本侵略集团力图加强火箭武器装备、在北大西洋公约组织内设置新的部队等，这说明，在国际关系中执行旧政策的鼓吹者是不甘罢休的。他们千方百计企图加剧国际紧张局势。
    亨德里赫最后强调说：捷克斯洛伐克人民同苏联以及社会主义其他国家的兄弟人民的团结关系坚如磐石。这就是我们将来一定胜利的保证。
