Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, April 24th. The International Women's Congress, held in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day, concluded here tonight after a four-day meeting. The meeting adopted a number of resolutions.

The resolution on peace stated: "Although international tensions have eased to some extent in recent times, women cannot ignore the fact that the danger of war still exists. They demand the cessation of everything that endangers peace: occupying forces, military bases on foreign territories, existing or planned military treaties. They hope to end the division of countries, to stop violations of national independence and sovereignty or territorial integrity, to stop racial discrimination, and to stop manifestations of the revival of fascism and militarism. They will seek ways to support the struggles of all oppressed people for peace and the national independence of their countries – which is one of the conditions for establishing lasting peace.

The conference also adopted letters addressed to the heads of government of the four major powers who will meet in Paris in May and to the ten-nation disarmament conference currently meeting in Geneva. These letters call for an agreement on complete and universal disarmament.

The thematic discussion groups reported to the conference. These reports discussed issues such as women's participation in social life, women's economic activities, women's civil rights, women's education and cultural development, and how to enable women to fulfill their responsibilities in society and at home. The reports pointed out the different situations of women in different countries and under different political, economic, and social systems.

The report on women's participation in social life pointed out that women "can only fully exercise their civil and political rights in conditions of freedom and national independence. That is to say, only in such circumstances can women fully assume their rightful tasks in social life."

Other reports argued that the principle of equality between men and women should be applied in practice and not just in theory.

Before the closing of the conference, the delegates held an impromptu concert, and women from various countries took to the stage to sing their national anthems. A concert was also held last night, during which many delegates performed music and dance programs. The Chinese classical dance performed by Chinese young dancer Zhao Qing won thunderous applause.

    国际妇女大会胜利闭幕
    号召警惕新战争危险　支持争取民族独立的斗争
    新华社哥本哈根24日电　为纪念国际劳动妇女节五十周年而举行的国际妇女大会在举行四天会议以后今天晚上在这里闭幕。会议通过了一些决议。
    关于和平的决议说：“最近时期内国际紧张局势有一定程度的缓和，但是妇女们不能忽视战争危险仍然存在的事实。她们要求制止危及和平的一切：占领军，在外国领土上的军事基地，现有的或正在准备的军事条约。她们希望结束国家的分裂状态，制止对民族独立和主权或领土完整的侵犯，制止种族歧视，并且制止法西斯主义和军国主义复活的表现。她们将寻找办法对一切被压迫者为争取和平和他们国家的民族独立——这是建立持久和平的条件之一——而进行的斗争表示支持。
    大会还通过了分别写给将在5月在巴黎会晤的四大国政府首脑以及正在日内瓦开会的十国裁军会议的信。这些信要求就全面和普遍裁军达成协议。
    专题讨论小组向大会作了报告。这些报告论述了妇女参加社会生活、妇女从事经济活动、妇女的民权、妇女的教育和文化发展以及如何使妇女能够尽到她们在社会上和家庭中的责任等方面的问题。报告指出了在不同的国家以及在不同的政治、经济和社会制度下，妇女的不同的情况。
    关于妇女参加社会生活的报告指出，妇女“只有在自由和民族独立的情况下才能完全行使她们的公民权利和政治权利。这就是说，只有在这样的情况下，妇女才能充分担负起她们在社会生活中的当然任务。”
    其他的报告主张，男女平等的原则应当运用在实际中而不只是运用在理论中。
    在大会闭幕前，代表们举行了一个即席演出的音乐会，各国的妇女登台演唱了她们的国歌。昨天晚上也举行了音乐会，许多代表演出了音乐和舞蹈节目。中国青年舞蹈家赵青表演的中国古典舞博得了雷动的掌声。
