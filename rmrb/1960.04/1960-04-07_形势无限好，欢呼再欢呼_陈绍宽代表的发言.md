    Chairman, fellow representatives, comrades:
    I fully agree with and sincerely support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft.
    This year, 1960, is the beginning of the 1960s. The excellent situation of the international struggle for peace and the excellent situation of the domestic struggle for the sustained great leap forward in the national economy are unfolding before us with infinite bright prospects. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have achieved great victories in the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction in the past ten years of the 1950s. The economic, political, cultural, and spiritual aspects of our country have undergone fundamental changes unprecedented in thousands of years, gradually changing the situation of old China's poverty and backwardness. We should cheer again and again. As people's representatives, we must express our heartfelt gratitude and pay our highest respects to the Chinese Communist Party, the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, who led and created these great achievements, and to the hardworking workers and peasants. This is the victory of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and the victory of the people of the whole country holding high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and advancing bravely.
    Our magnificent national economic plan for 1959 has become a glorious reality due to the implementation of a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies by the entire people, and the development of mass movements for increasing production and practicing economy through technological innovation and technological revolution. The total output value of industry and agriculture, the output of major industrial and agricultural products, and the national income have all greatly exceeded the targets of the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan, realizing the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. Such rapid development of our national economy has never been seen even in the golden age of capitalist countries. Taking steel production as an example, we increased it from 5.3 million tons to 13.35 million tons in only two years. This took the United States nine years, pre-war Germany thirteen years, France thirty-three years, and Britain thirty-four years. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Last year, we encountered severe natural disasters that had not been seen in decades. Thanks to the great superiority of the People's Commune, which effectively organized the vast number of commune members to carry out a heroic struggle against the disasters, agricultural production, in addition to the Great Leap Forward in grain and cotton, other agricultural products also increased to varying degrees compared with the previous year. Before liberation, this would have caused tens of millions of people to be displaced and starved to death. If such a severe disaster had occurred in a capitalist country, it would have been impossible to resist. Last year, while our economic undertakings were making a great leap forward, education, health, science, and culture also achieved great leaps forward. From the second half of last year to this year, I have successively visited my province, as well as the three northeastern provinces, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Hainan Island, and Shanghai, Zhejiang. Recently, I also inspected various parts of Fujian. Seeing that our country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, has accomplished so many things in just about ten years that no one has ever done before, I am even more clearly aware of the extraordinary talent of the working class and that the Party's leadership is the most important thing. This year's national economic plan, formulated on the basis of this victory, striving for a new and greater leap forward, is completely in line with the spirit of high-speed development of our socialist construction general line and is creating better conditions for a better overall leap forward in the years to come. Now, the continued development of the People's Commune, the better application of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and the upsurge of the agricultural technology innovation and agricultural technology revolution movement have emerged throughout the country. It is possible and necessary to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, which is of extreme importance for promoting the overall leap forward of the national economy. Adhering to the policy of combining centralized leadership with mass movements and continuing to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy on all fronts is completely in line with the actual needs of our current socialist construction and is also the most important task of our people in the current socialist construction front.
    Under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction and on the basis of the continuous great leap forward of the national economy, the implementation of our national budget is good, which further demonstrates the great superiority of the socialist financial system. Our draft national budget for this year is also formulated on the basis of the great leap forward of the national economy and is also an active budget for peaceful construction, which is fundamentally different from the budgets of imperialism, especially US imperialism. This is in line with the principle of developing the economy and ensuring supply, more income, more expenditure, more construction, vigorously supporting industry while actively supporting agriculture, supporting the People's Commune, supporting the technical transformation of agriculture, unified leadership, comprehensive arrangements, joint efforts to increase production, and practicing strict economy. This year's national budget can certainly be completed and overfulfilled.
    Last year, Fujian Province responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPC, and a new upsurge of vigorously opposing rightist tendencies, boosting morale, and carrying out mass movements to increase production and practice economy emerged, and launched a great march towards industrial and agricultural production, resulting in a situation where production was higher every month. Steel production completed the production plan ahead of schedule, iron production completed the plan 55 days ahead of schedule, machinery industry production completed the plan 50 days ahead of schedule, and light industry production completed the plan 58 days ahead of schedule. Although agricultural production in some areas suffered natural disasters, the realization of the People's Commune showed unparalleled superiority. Last year, Fujian's grain production generally reported large-scale bumper harvests, an increase of more than 20% compared with 1958. Last autumn, the grain yield in one season alone was close to the total annual output of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The achievements of water conservancy construction in the ten years after liberation surpassed those of thousands of years. Forestry has also developed at a high speed. Last year, the state-assigned timber task was overfulfilled in the third quarter. Since last year, people's communes in various places have seized the opportunity of slack farming seasons to carry out an unprecedented large-scale mountain management movement. The province has developed more than 4 million mu of barren mountains. People in various places have more vigorously promoted the communist style, afforestation and fruit planting, and strive to turn barren mountains into treasures. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, cultural, educational and health undertakings are also developing in the same way. Secondary education has jumped to the forefront of the country. In terms of health, schistosomiasis and other diseases that seriously endanger people's health have been eliminated. Brother provinces and cities continuously organize visiting groups to visit Fujian or hold on-site meetings, which gives the people of Fujian great encouragement. This year's national economic plan in this province is a plan for continued great leap forward. At the beginning of the new year, the people of the whole province are gearing up to welcome this year's great leap forward. Good news of "a good start" and "red every month" are constantly reported from various places. They are still striving for "a full house of red" and "red to the end", and strive to complete and overfulfill the glorious annual plan tasks assigned by the state ahead of schedule. The people of the whole province are actively studying Chairman Mao's works and studying Mao Zedong Thought. Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth that is applicable everywhere, and Mao Zedong Thought is the product of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. It is the highest expression of the wisdom of the Chinese nation and the highest standard in theory. If we earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, we will be able to use theory to guide practice, make our work better, recognize the worldviews of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and play a greater role in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.
    At present, the domestic and international situations are very good, which greatly benefits our peaceful construction and the struggle to defend world peace. The east wind is further prevailing over the west wind, becoming increasingly powerful. However, while flaunting peace, US imperialism still insists on its policy of expanding arms and preparing for war, expanding atomic and nuclear weapons bases, and stepping up the formation of aggressive blocs. Not long ago, it also colluded with Japanese militarism to sign the so-called "Japan-US Joint Cooperation and Security Treaty," which further exposed its hideous face of false peace and true war preparation. Recently, our country successively signed agreements with Myanmar and Nepal on border issues, which severely struck at the imperialists' conspiracy to sow discord. Our country's unwavering policy in international affairs is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress. US imperialism still occupies our sacred territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. US imperialism cannot stay in Taiwan. The special situation in Fujian is that it is at the forefront of the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and the people of the whole province are extremely eager to defend peace. Recently, when I went to the front line to conduct Spring Festival condolences, I saw that the front-line people's enthusiasm for fighting the enemy was very high, the three armies on the front line were full of fighting spirit, and I was very excited to see the unity between the army and the people. I hope that the KMT military and political personnel in Taiwan will stimulate national justice, stand under the patriotic banner, and unite with the people of the motherland as soon as possible to complete the great cause of reunification of the motherland. Under the encouragement of this excellent domestic and international situation, we must unite more closely, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, adhere to putting politics in command, the mass line, adhere to the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and forge ahead victoriously, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, study Mao Zedong Thought, and strengthen ideological construction. I believe that in the first year of the 1960s, our country's national economy will be able to be completed and overfulfilled even earlier, achieving even more brilliant achievements than before. The entire 1960s will continue to advance from one victory to another in the domestic construction of socialism and communism, and in the international defense of peace and human progress.
    I wish the conference a successful conclusion and everyone good health.

    形势无限好，欢呼再欢呼
    陈绍宽代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    我对于李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告表示完全同意和诚恳的拥护。
    今年1960年是二十世纪六十年代开始的一年，在国际争取和平斗争的大好形势，在国内争取国民经济持续大跃进的大好形势都在我们面前展现着无限的光明景象。全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在过去五十年代的十年中，取得了民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，我国的经济、政治、文化和精神各方面的面貌都发生了几千年以来所没有过的根本变化，日益改变着旧中国一穷二白的情况，我们应该欢呼再欢呼。作为人民代表的我们，必须向领导和创造这些伟大成就的中国共产党和各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席以及辛勤劳动的工农同志们，致以衷心的感谢，并表示崇高的敬意。这是中国共产党和毛主席正确领导的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利，是全国人民高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜奋勇前进的胜利。
    我们1959年宏伟的国民经济计划，由于全民贯彻执行了一整套两条腿走路的方针，并开展了技术革新和技术革命的增产节约的群众性运动，这个计划已经变成了辉煌的现实，工农业总产值、工农业主要产品产量和国民收入都大大超过了第二个五年计划最后一年的指标，实现了中共八届八中全会的伟大号召。我国国民经济这样飞跃发展，在资本主义国家的黄金时代也是不曾有过的。拿钢的产量来说，我们从五百三十万吨增加到一千三百三十五万吨，只用两年的时间，这在美国要用九年，战前的德国要用十三年，法国要用三十三年，英国要用三十四年的时间。这一点就充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。去年我们遇到几十年来没有过的严重的自然灾害，由于人民公社发挥了巨大优越性，有效地组织了广大社员进行英勇的抗灾斗争，农业生产除粮食、棉花仍然得到了大跃进以外，其他农产物比前年也都有不同程度的增长。这在解放前，一定会造成几千万人颠沛流离、饿殍载道的惨状；假使这样严重的灾情发生在资本主义国家里，则是难以抗拒的。去年我们在经济事业大跃进的同时，教育、卫生、科学、文化各项事业也都得到了大跃进。我在去年下半年到今年，曾经先后在本省并到东北三省和河北、山东、广东、海南岛以及上海、浙江各地参观，最近并在福建各地视察，看到我们国家在党和毛主席的英明领导下，仅仅十年左右的时间就做出了这许许多多前人从来没有做过的事业，使我更加明确地认识到工人阶级的非凡才能和千条万条党的领导第一条。今年在这胜利基础上制订国民经济计划，争取新的更大的跃进，完全是符合我们社会主义建设总路线高速度发展的精神，是为以后年份创造更好的全面跃进条件。现在，人民公社继续发展，八字宪法更好运用，以及农业技术革新和农业技术革命运动的高潮已在全国范围内涌现起来了，提前实现全国农业发展纲要是可能的和需要的，这对于促进国民经济的全面跃进有极端重要的意义。坚持集中领导和群众运动相结合的方针，继续开展各个战线上的增产节约运动，这完全适合我国当前社会主义建设的实际需要，也是我们全国人民在当前社会主义建设战线上头等重要的任务。
    我们国家预算在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在国民经济连续大跃进的基础上，执行结果良好，更显得社会主义财政制度具有巨大的优越性。我们今年国家预算草案又是在国民经济大跃进的基础上来制定的，又是积极的和平建设预算，同帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的预算有着根本的区别。这是符合发展经济保证供给的原则，多收入、多支出、多建设，在大力支援工业的同时，积极支援农业，支援人民公社，支援农业的技术改造，统一领导、全面安排、共同努力增加生产，厉行节约，今年的国家预算一定可以完成和超额完成。
    福建省去年响应了中共八届八中全会和中共福建省委的号召，涌起了轰轰烈烈的反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约的群众性运动的新高潮，并向工农业生产大进军，结果出现了生产一月高过一月的局面。钢的产量提前完成了生产计划，铁的生产提前五十五天完成计划，机械工业生产提前五十天完成计划，轻工业生产提前五十八天完成计划。农业生产虽然部分地区遭到自然灾害，但是由于实现了人民公社化，显示出无比的优越性。去年福建粮食生产普告大面积丰收，比1958年增产20％以上，去年秋季粮食一季就接近大跃进的1958年的全年产量。水利建设解放后十年的成就胜过千年。林业也高速度地发展，去年在第三季度就超额完成了国家所交给的到材任务。去年以来，各地人民公社抓紧农时空隙，开展了空前规模的治山运动，全省开发了荒山四百多万亩，各地人民更加有劲地发扬共产主义风格，造林种果，争取把荒山变成为万宝山。随着工农业的飞跃发展，文教卫生事业也同样地在发展。中等教育跃到全国先进行列。在卫生方面，消灭了危害人民健康最严重的血吸虫病等。兄弟省市不断地组织参观团来福建参观或开现场会议，给福建人民以极大的鼓舞。今年本省国民经济计划是继续大跃进的计划，全省人民在新年开始就鼓足冲天干劲迎接今年的大跃进，各地不断地传到开门红、月月红喜讯，超额完成了第一季度计划，现在还继续在争取满堂红、红到底，力求提前和超额完成国家交给的光荣的全年计划任务。全省人民正在积极学习毛主席的著作，学习毛泽东思想。马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的产物，是中国民族智慧的最高表现和理论上最高标准。我们认真学习毛泽东思想，就能够运用理论来指导实践，使工作做得更好，认清了资产阶级和无产阶级的世界观，在反对国内外敌人的斗争中，也一定会起更大的作用。
    目前，国内国际形势都很好，大大有利于我们和平建设和保卫世界和平的斗争，东风进一步压倒西风，越来越强大。但是美帝国主义在标榜和平的同时，仍然坚持扩军备战政策，扩大原子和核武器基地，加紧拼凑侵略集团，不久之前，还勾结日本军国主义签订了所谓“日美共同合作和安全条约”，更加暴露出假和平真备战的狰狞面目。最近我国同缅甸和尼泊尔先后签订了边界问题的协定，就给帝国主义挑拨离间的阴谋以严重打击。我国在国际事务中坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步事业的崇高目的而努力。美帝国主义至今还霸占着我国神圣领土台湾，中国人民一定要解放台湾，美帝国主义想赖在台湾不走是不行的。福建的特殊情况是处在解放台湾斗争的最前线，全省人民保卫和平的愿望极为迫切。最近我到前线进行春节慰问的时候，看到前线人民对敌斗争的情绪非常高涨，前线三军斗志昂扬，精神焕发，并看到军民团结的情况，感到万分兴奋。我希望在台湾的国民党军政人员激发民族大义，站在爱国旗帜下，快些同祖国人民团结一致，完成祖国统一大业。我们在这国际国内大好形势的鼓舞下，更加紧密团结一致，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，群众路线，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，乘胜奋勇向前迈进，认真学习毛主席的著作，学习毛泽东思想，加强思想建设。我相信，六十年代开始头一年的我国国民经济一定能够更加提前和超额完成，取得比以前更加辉煌的成就。整个六十年代比五十年代无论在国内建设社会主义、共产主义方面，在国际保卫和平和人类进步事业方面，都将继续从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。
    敬祝大会胜利成功，各位身体健康。
