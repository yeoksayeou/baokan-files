The brilliant light of the General Line illuminates the Xining Iron and Steel Plant

Speech by Committee Member Ma Xingtai

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the various reports made to the meeting by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and will earnestly implement them in future work. Now, I will only make the following statement regarding the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production in the Xining area since 1958.

Qinghai Province is a multi-ethnic region. Over the past ten years since liberation, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the general line of the transition period and the general line of socialist construction, we have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The impoverished and backward face of Qinghai has undergone fundamental changes, and all ethnic groups have entered a new socialist era of common development and prosperity. With the development of the Great Leap Forward, people's communes were universally established in just two or three months. The realization of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes further promoted a mass upsurge in iron and steel production. In the 1958 Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production, tens of thousands of workers, farmers (herdsmen), and cadres went up the mountains to mine, build furnaces, and smelt steel, fighting for iron and steel, and produced 3,334 tons of iron and 1,085 tons of indigenous steel, thus ending the history of our province's inability to produce even an inch of iron. In the short span of one year from 1958 to 1959, we successfully transitioned from small-scale indigenous groups to small-scale modern groups, and established a small iron and steel industrial base. Taking the Xining Iron and Steel Plant, which I inspected, as an example, on the basis of the victory in 1958, especially under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Second Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we vigorously opposed rightist tendencies, greatly boosted revolutionary enthusiasm, and continued to launch a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy. The broad masses of workers were full of spirit and high in morale, and created many more outstanding achievements. After completing and overfulfilling various production tasks for 1959 ahead of schedule, they immediately won a victorious start in January of this year, completing a total of 910 tons of pig iron production for the entire month, exceeding the monthly plan by 154%; according to incomplete statistics from February 1st to 8th, the average daily production of pig iron was 42.1 tons; the daily production of pig iron in the first half of March has reached more than 100 tons, an increase of 31 tons compared with the highest daily output in August and September 1959. As of the 10th of this month, the entire plant has overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten days of the month. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has reached 4.11, of which a No. 5 small blast furnace has repeatedly created new records, with the daily output on March 8th alone soaring to 32.58 tons. These rapidly developing and outstanding achievements have pushed the pig iron production of small blast furnaces in our province to a new peak, realizing a comprehensive and continuous leap forward with high yield, high speed, high quality, low consumption, and low cost, reaching advanced levels.

This young small-scale iron and steel plant has overcome numerous difficulties by adhering to the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, and launching mass movements, using the method of walking on two legs. In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, many advanced production tools were created, such as: loading machines, welding machines, detectors, and the successful experimentation of indigenous methods of coke smelting, small blast furnace water pump connection casting, etc., solving many technical difficulties, and creating favorable conditions for better high yield and high quality.

Under the leadership of the Party and with the strong cooperation of fraternal factories, the broad masses of workers of the Xining Iron and Steel Plant, with soaring enthusiasm, victoriously completed the glorious task of producing iron rails for our province's first indigenous railway from Xining to Datong, enabling the train from Xining to Datong to open to traffic ahead of schedule. These many significant achievements have greatly inspired and educated me, deeply moved me, and made me even more excited.

The rapid development of iron and steel production in our province specifically embodies that the Party's leadership is incomparably great and correct, that it is a great victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, a great victory of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, and also a great victory of resolutely implementing the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policies.

Like all parts of the country, the socialist construction of our province is advancing by leaps and bounds. As a democratic personage, I must resolutely follow the Party and take the socialist road in the future. Under the correct leadership of the Party, I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works, accelerate self-transformation, and contribute all my strength to building a great socialist motherland at an even higher speed.

### 总路线的光辉照耀着西宁炼铁厂  马兴泰委员的发言

    总路线的光辉照耀着西宁炼铁厂
    马兴泰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理对会议所作的各项报告，并在今后工作中认真贯彻执行。现在我仅就西宁地区从1958年以来，大炼钢铁的伟大胜利作如下发言。
    青海省是一个多民族地区，解放十年来，各族人民在党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在过渡时期总路线、社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，已经取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。使青海贫穷落后的面貌，起了根本变化，各族人民已进入了共同发展繁荣的社会主义新时代。随着大跃进的发展形势，仅在两三个月内就普遍实现了人民公社化。由于大跃进和人民公社的实现，进一步推动了群众性的大炼钢铁生产的高潮。1958年大炼钢铁运动，成千上万的工人、农（牧）民、干部上山采矿，筑炉炼钢，为钢铁而战，炼出了铁三千三百三十四吨，土钢一千零八十五吨，从此，结束了我省寸铁不出的历史。1958年到1959年短短一年的时间，就由小土群胜利地过渡到小洋群，建立了小型的钢铁工业基地。仅从我视察看到的西宁炼铁厂来说，在1958年胜利的基础上，特别是党的八届八中全会和中共青海省委二届十二次全体会议（扩大）精神的鼓舞下，大反右倾，大鼓革命干劲，继续掀起增产节约运动新高潮，广大职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，创造了许多更加优异的成绩。在提前和超额完成1959年各项生产任务后，紧接着在今年又胜利地夺得了1月份的开门红，全月共完成了生铁生产九百一十吨，超额完成了月计划的154％；从2月1日到8日的不完全统计，平均日产生铁四十二点一吨；3月份上半月的日产生铁已达一百余吨，比1959年8、9两月最高日产量提高三十一吨，截至本月10日，全厂已超额完成了上旬生产计划。高炉利用系数已达四点一一，其中一个五号小高炉，一再创造了新纪录，仅3月8日的日产量猛增三十二点五八吨。这些飞速发展的优异成就，把我省小高炉的生铁生产，推向了一个新的高峰，实现了高产、高速、优质、低耗、低成本的全面持续跃进的局面，达到了先进水平。
    这个年轻的小型炼铁厂，由于坚持了党的领导、政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，用两条腿走路的方法，战胜了重重困难。在大搞技术革新和技术革命中，创造了许多先进生产工具，如：上料机、电焊机、检查器和实验成功了土法炼焦、小高炉水泵接浇铸等，解决了许多技术方面的困难，为更好的高产、优质创造良好的条件。
    西宁炼铁厂，在党的领导下，在兄弟厂的大力协作配合下，广大职工群众干劲冲天，胜利地完成了我省第一条西宁至大通的土铁路铁轨生产的光荣任务，使西宁至大通的火车提前通车。这许许多多的重大成就，对我舞鼓和教育很大，使我深受感动，也更加兴奋。
    从我省钢铁生产的飞速发展形势，具体地体现了党的领导是无比伟大和正确，是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利，是大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，也是坚决贯彻执行了党的一整套“两条腿走路”方针的伟大胜利。
    我省和全国各地一样，社会主义建设一日千里的飞速前进，我作为一个民主人士，今后必须坚决跟着党走社会主义道路，在党的正确领导下，努力学习毛主席著作，加速自我改造，为更高速度的建设社会主义的伟大祖国贡献自己的一切力量。
