Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, April 16th: Lin Tie, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was invited to attend the 13th Congress of the Belgian Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress on the 16th and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee to the Congress. The full text of the congratulatory speech is as follows:
Dear Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, all members of the Communist Party of China, and the people of China, I would like to express my warm brotherly congratulations to your Party's Congress and, through the Congress, express my sincere respect to all members of the Belgian Communist Party, the Belgian working class, and the Belgian people.

The Belgian working class has a glorious tradition of struggle. The Belgian Communist Party, as the loyal representative of the interests of the Belgian working class and working people, has carried out a long-term struggle for the revolutionary cause of the Belgian working class. The Belgian Communist Party has waged effective struggles to unite the entire Belgian working class and progressive forces, and to strive for and safeguard the democratic rights and vital interests of the working people. In order to free its country from the interference of imperialist monopoly groups, and to defend world peace and national independence and sovereignty, the Belgian Communist Party resolutely opposes the imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and opposes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is an instrument of aggression of the imperialist camp. With the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the Belgian Communist Party sympathizes with and supports the liberation struggles of oppressed nations, and supported the independence movement of the Congolese people who have been enslaved and humiliated for a long time; now the Congolese people have taken a big step towards the great cause of national independence. We firmly believe that your Congress will play an important role in further raising the consciousness of the Belgian working class and in developing the struggle of the Belgian working class and working people to achieve socialism. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people warmly support the development and victory of the struggle of your party and people.

We are pleased to see that in recent years, the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Belgium have been increasing and expanding. The exchanges between our two parties have also become closer. Not long ago, a delegation of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, headed by Comrade Vandenbranden, participated in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country and visited our country. Our Party also sent its representatives to participate in your Party's last Congress in 1957. These exchanges have further strengthened the understanding and friendship between the two parties and the two peoples. Let me express my heartfelt thanks to the Belgian Communist Party and the Belgian people for their support to our people.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the red flags of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, are carrying out socialist construction at high speed. The main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan, originally scheduled to be completed in 1962, were completed three years ahead of schedule in 1959. In 1960, we will increase our country's total industrial and agricultural output value by 23% compared with 1959 at the speed of continuous leap forward.

Since 1958, our people have been striving with full confidence to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years. Then, on this basis, we will make further efforts to realize the modernization of our industry, agriculture, science and culture, so as to build our country into a powerful socialist country.

We are also very excited to see the great victories achieved by the Soviet Union in the process of implementing the Seven-Year Plan for the comprehensive development of communist construction, and the brilliant achievements in the field of space science and technology, as well as the great progress made in the construction of other socialist countries. The great achievements made by the socialist camp in its construction undertakings, and the increasingly close unity between them, have strongly attracted the people of all countries to the socialist cause. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries for liberation. Now, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing; the masses of the people in capitalist countries, under the leadership of the Communist Parties of their countries, are experiencing arduous and complex struggles, and have also achieved significant achievements. Conversely, the imperialist camp is facing difficulties everywhere and is increasingly falling into a state of disunity. These facts show that the socialist forces have a significant advantage over the imperialist forces, the forces of peace have a significant advantage over the forces of war, and the East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind.

As a result of the above-mentioned struggles, the international tension created by imperialism has begun to show some signs of easing, and the US imperialist ruling clique has been forced to make some gestures of peace. But we cannot fail to see that while playing with peace conspiracies, US imperialism is actually stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, vigorously developing intercontinental missiles, establishing and expanding missile bases everywhere, announcing that it will conduct underground nuclear explosions, actively piecing together military blocs, and vigorously reviving the militarism of West Germany and Japan, making these two countries a hotbed of serious war danger. All these facts show that imperialism has not abandoned its policy of war and aggression.

Comrades! Communist parties of all countries must take on the cause of safeguarding peace. Only by constantly exposing all the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace, educating the people, uniting the people, and strengthening the struggle to defend peace, can the war plans of US imperialism be postponed, even stopped, and the cause of safeguarding peace can achieve greater victories.

Now imperialism also uses modern revisionism to undermine the great unity of the international communist movement. Therefore, modern revisionism is still the main danger to the current communist movement. The Moscow Declaration adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in November 1957 is a historically significant program for the modern international proletariat struggle. It has become a sharp weapon for strengthening international communist unity, defeating imperialism and its tool revisionism, and it guides us to unite and achieve continuous victories in continuing the resolute struggle against revisionism, in the struggle against imperialist war forces and for world peace, and in the struggle to develop the cause of human progress.

Dear comrades, the current situation is very favorable to us. Let us hold high the glorious banner of "Workers of all countries, unite!" and advance bravely towards the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Now, please allow me to read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the 13th Congress of the Belgian Communist Partydear comrades:

On behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm brotherly congratulations to the 13th Congress of the Belgian Communist Party and all members of the Belgian Communist Party.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are watching with brotherly feelings your struggle to defend world peace, safeguard the vital rights of the working people, and strive for social progress. Your struggle is an integral part of the great liberation movement carried out by the progressive people of the world.

We wish your party's 13th Congress a complete success, wish your party new progress in the cause of uniting the entire working class, uniting all working people and democratic and progressive forces, and wish your party and your people greater achievements in safeguarding the vital interests of the working people and in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    林铁在比共代表大会上致贺词
    比利时共产党为团结比利时整个工人阶级和进步力量，为争取和维护劳动人民的民主权利和切身利益进行了卓有成效的斗争，并以无产阶级的国际主义精神，同情和支持被压迫民族的解放战斗。中、比两国人民之间的友好往来在不断扩大，我们两党之间的往来也更加密切。我们各国共产党人必须把维护和平的事业担当起来，只有不断地揭露和平敌人的一切阴谋诡计，来教育人民，团结人民，并加强保卫和平的斗争，那么美帝国主义的战争计划才有可能被推迟，被阻止，维护和平的事业才能取得更大胜利。
    新华社布鲁塞尔16日电　应邀参加比利时共产党第十三次代表大会的中国共产党中央委员会代表林铁16日向大会致贺词，并且宣读了中共中央给大会的贺电。贺词全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向你们党的代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并通过大会向比利时共产党全体党员、比利时工人阶级和人民表示衷心的敬意。
    比利时工人阶级有着光荣的斗争传统。比利时共产党作为比利时工人阶级和劳动人民利益的忠实的代表者，为比利时工人阶级的革命事业进行了长期的斗争。比利时共产党为团结比利时整个工人阶级和进步力量、为争取和维护劳动人民的民主权利和切身利益，进行了卓有成效的斗争。比利时共产党为着使自己国家摆脱帝国主义垄断集团的干涉，为了保卫世界和平和本民族的独立、主权，坚决地反对帝国主义的扩军备战政策，反对作为帝国主义阵营侵略工具的北大西洋公约组织。比利时共产党以无产阶级的国际主义精神，同情和支持被压迫民族的解放斗争，支持了长期被奴役和凌辱的刚果人民的独立运动；现在刚果人民已经向着民族独立的伟大事业迈出了一大步。我们深信，你们的这次代表大会对于进一步提高比利时工人阶级的觉悟，对于发展比利时工人阶级和劳动人民争取实现社会主义的斗争，将起重要的作用。中国共产党和中国人民对于你们党和人民的斗争的发展和胜利予以热烈的支持。
    我们满意地看到，最近几年来，中、比两国人民之间的友好往来在不断增加和扩大。我们两党之间的往来也更加密切了。不久以前，以范登布兰敦同志为首的比共中央代表团参加了我国建国十周年纪念，并在我国进行了访问。我们党也在1957年派出了自己的代表参加了你们党的上届代表大会，这些往来活动进一步加强了两党和两国人民之间的了解和友谊。让我对比利时共产党和比利时人民对于我国人民的支持表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，正在高速度地进行社会主义建设。原定于1962年完成的第二个五年计划的主要指标，已经在1959年提前三年完成。在1960年，我们将在持续跃进的速度下，把我国的工农业总产值比1959年提高23％。
    从1958年起，我国人民正满怀信心地争取在十年时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，然后，在这个基础上进一步地进行努力，实现我国工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家。
    我们还十分兴奋地看到，苏联在执行全面展开共产主义建设的七年计划过程中所取得的伟大胜利，和在宇宙空间科学技术方面所取得的辉煌成就，以及其他社会主义国家的建设也取得了巨大的进展。社会主义阵营在建设事业上所取得的伟大成就，以及它们之间越来越紧密的团结，极其强烈地吸引了各国人民对社会主义事业的向往，这是对于各国人民谋取解放的革命斗争的一个巨大鼓舞。现在，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正在蓬勃发展；资本主义国家的人民大众在本国共产党的领导下，经历着艰苦复杂的斗争，也取得了重大的成就。相反的，帝国主义阵营却处处困难重重和越来越陷于四分五裂的境地。这些事实说明了社会主义力量对于帝国主义力量、和平力量对于战争力量占着显著的优势，东风愈益压倒了西风。
    由于上述斗争的结果，帝国主义所制造的国际紧张局势就开始出现了某些和缓的趋势，美帝国主义统治集团被迫地不得不做出某些和平表示。但是我们不能不看到，美帝国主义在玩弄和平阴谋的同时，实际上却在加紧扩军备战，大力发展洲际导弹，到处建立和扩大导弹基地，宣布要进行地下核爆炸，积极拼凑军事集团，大力复活西德和日本的军国主义，使这两个国家成为严重战争危险的策源地。所有这些事实，正是表明了帝国主义并没有放弃它的战争政策和侵略政策。
    同志们！我们各国共产党人必须把维护和平的事业担当起来。只有不断地揭露和平敌人的一切阴谋诡计，来教育人民，团结人民，并加强保卫和平的斗争，那么美帝国主义的战争计划才有可能被推迟，以至被阻止，维护和平的事业才能取得更大的胜利。
    现在帝国主义还在利用现代修正主义来破坏国际共产主义运动的伟大团结，因此现代修正主义仍然是共产主义运动当前的主要危险。1957年11月各国共产党和工人党所通过的莫斯科会议宣言是具有历史意义的现代国际无产阶级斗争的纲领。它已经成为加强国际共产主义团结、战胜帝国主义及其工具修正主义的锐利武器，它引导我们在继续同修正主义进行坚决的斗争中，在反对帝国主义战争势力和争取世界和平的斗争中，在发展人类进步事业的斗争中，团结一致，取得不断的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，目前的形势对我们十分有利。让我们高举起全世界无产者联合起来的光荣旗帜，向着和平、民主和社会主义事业奋勇前进。
    现在请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会的贺电：
    中国共产党中央委员会致比利时共产党第十三次代表大会贺电亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党全体党员，谨向比利时共产党第十三次代表大会和比利时共产党全体党员致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国共产党和中国人民以兄弟般的心情注视着你们为保卫世界和平、维护劳动人民的切身权利和争取社会进步而进行的斗争。你们的斗争是全世界进步人类所进行的伟大的解放运动的一个组成部分。
    谨祝你们党的第十三次代表大会获得圆满的成功，祝你们党在团结整个工人阶级、团结一切劳动人民和民主进步力量的事业上获得新的进展，祝你们的党和你们的人民在维护劳动人民切身利益、在争取和平、民主和社会主义事业的斗争中获得更大的成就。
                                中国共产党中央委员会
                                          1960年4月15日
