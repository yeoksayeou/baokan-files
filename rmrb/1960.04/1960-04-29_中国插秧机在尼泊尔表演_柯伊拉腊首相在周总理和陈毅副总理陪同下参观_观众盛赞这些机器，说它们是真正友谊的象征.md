Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th — Three Chinese rice transplanters today planted rice seedlings from China for the first time in Nepalese soil. These three transplanters were gifts from Chairman Liu Shaoqi to Nepalese Prime Minister B.P. Koirala during his visit to China.

Prime Minister Koirala, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier Chen Yi, visited the transplanting demonstration at the Nepalese government experimental farm. Many Nepalese officials, agricultural experts, and farmers were also present.

The three transplanters were the "Liling No. 2", the "Nan Yi-Ling-Wu No. B", and the "Guangxi Wu-Jiu-San type." He Jisheng, the inventor of the "Liling No. 2" transplanter, who recently arrived from China, and Ni Yiwei, a technician from the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute and one of the inventors of the "Nan Yi-Ling-Wu No. B" transplanter, accurately and quickly demonstrated how to use these machines.

The people watching the demonstration unanimously praised the machines and discussed which transplanter was the best and fastest. Finally, everyone concluded that these machines could be used on the plains of Nepal as well as in the mountainous areas. One expert said that this was an amazing invention in the history of rice cultivation and a testament to the wisdom of the Chinese people. They are a symbol of true friendship.

A worker on the farm happily said that he liked these machines because they were efficient, saved labor, and could be made from local materials.

Premier Zhou Enlai introduced the two demonstrators to Prime Minister Koirala and asked them to do their best to teach the Nepalese people how to use these machines during their stay in Nepal. Prime Minister Koirala expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai.

Premier Zhou Enlai presented on the spot a batch of technical data books about these rice transplanters, as well as small blast furnaces, small converters, and paper mills.

    新华社加德满都28日电　三部中国水稻插秧机今天第一次把来自中国的稻秧插在尼泊尔的土地上。这三部插秧机是刘少奇主席在尼泊尔首相毕·普·柯伊拉腊访问中国的时候赠送给他的。
    柯伊拉腊首相在周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的陪同下，参观了在尼泊尔政府实验农场上进行的这次插秧表演。在场参观的还有许多尼泊尔官员、农业专家和农民。
    这三部插秧机是醴陵二号，南一○五号B型和广西五九三型。最近从中国到达这里的醴陵二号插秧机的发明者、农民贺继生和南京农业机械化研究所技术员、南一○五号B型插秧机的发明者之一倪已维准确和迅速地表演了他们使用这些机器的方法。
    在场观看表演的人们一致盛赞这些机器，并且讨论着哪一种插秧机最好、最快。最后大家得出结论：这些机器可以在尼泊尔平原上，也可以在尼泊尔的山区里使用。一位专家说，这是种稻史上的一个惊人的发明，也是中国人民的智慧的一个证明。它们是真正友谊的象征。
    农场上的一个工人高兴地说，他喜欢这些机器，因为这些机器效率高，节省劳力，而且可以就地取材就地制造。
    周恩来总理把两位表演者介绍给柯伊拉腊首相，并且要求他们在尼泊尔逗留期间应当尽最大的力量教会尼泊尔人民使用这些机器。柯伊拉腊首相对周恩来总理表示感谢。
    周恩来总理当场赠送一批关于这些水稻插秧机以及小高炉、小转炉和造纸厂的技术资料书籍。
