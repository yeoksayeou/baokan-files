Comrades, Representatives:

Listening to the reports of the three Vice Premiers has been extremely enlightening and encouraging. I wholeheartedly support them. Indeed, without adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, it would have been impossible to achieve the great success of the continued Great Leap Forward last year. I am a member of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qianxian County, Shaanxi Province. I won't talk about anything else, but just taking the agricultural technical school established by our commune as an example, it would have been very difficult to set it up without the People's Commune; even if it had been set up, it would have been difficult to run it well.

Before communization, several of us young farmers, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act," engaged in experimental fields and agricultural scientific research with the support of the Party and the government. At that time, we did quite well. However, with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, our kind of experimental research could not keep up with the needs of the situation. Land and labor could not be fixed, and records and summaries were not systematic; it was inconvenient for small villages and cooperatives to visit and disseminate information; training classes could only last for three or four days, and complex techniques could not be learned quickly. Moreover, many agricultural techniques require repeated learning in practice to master, otherwise, problems would often occur; successful high-yield experiences could not be quickly promoted on a large scale. At that time, the Township Party Committee considered these situations and selected thirty-four young people from various agricultural cooperatives to form a professional experimental team specializing in experimental research. However, some agricultural cooperatives felt that taking their labor to grow crops for other cooperatives was undesirable, and they were unwilling to let young people participate in experimental research. Later, the People's Commune was established, and thirty-eight agricultural cooperatives formed a People's Commune. With the integration of government and commune, the organizational scale became larger, and mobilizing and arranging labor became much more convenient and reasonable than in the original agricultural cooperatives. This created favorable conditions for large-scale agricultural scientific research. Therefore, in just a few days, we quickly established an agricultural technical school on the foundation of the original professional experimental team. This school was not only established by the People's Commune but also developed rapidly relying on the strength of the People's Commune. The scale of the school increased, labor and land were fixed, and the number of students also increased, reaching seventy-four people. Everyone felt hopeful, worked hard, and engaged in large-scale experiments. After a year of struggle, we solved many technical problems in production, created several high-yield experiences, resolved the contradiction between replanting corn and continuous wheat cropping, and promoted the development of commune production. More importantly, we have cultivated a group of agricultural technical backbones. The sixty-seven graduates can all use the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture to guide the high yield of wheat, cotton, and corn, and they can all use small-area comparative experiments to solve technical problems in production. Many students are also familiar with hybrid breeding techniques and field recording methods, and they have a preliminary understanding of the scientific principles of hybrid breeding. Therefore, after they graduated and returned to their teams, some served as technicians in production teams, some served as teachers in technical schools, and some served as captains of professional experimental teams. Furthermore, they established seven new agricultural technical branch schools, with more than seven hundred people participating in the learning, established three hundred and twenty-one professional experimental teams, and conducted more than three hundred small-area comparative experiments.

	Both a School and a Farm

In just over a year, our agricultural technical school has developed into a school that combines experimental production with production, learning, and scientific research. It is both a school and an experimental farm, both concentrated learning and not separated from production, which can not only improve students' cultural and technical level and carry out scientific research but also directly promote current production. In terms of learning methods, our school has adopted the method of learning while practicing, learning after class, and practicing after learning, which not only enables students to firmly grasp classroom knowledge and be able to apply it but also provides a theoretical basis for field operations and enables them to improve it in a timely manner. Therefore, the technical knowledge and practical operation ability of the graduates have generally reached the primary technical level, and 20% have reached the intermediate technical level. They can engage in variety hybridization, arrange experiments, conduct field surveys and related analysis and tests, and also write experimental summaries. Because learning and production are directly combined and closely related to the production team, not only has agricultural technology been effectively learned, but also advanced experiences have been promoted quickly and well. For example, the high-yield experience of corn planted in alternating rows of tall and short stalks was only promoted to more than 20% in the past. After regular demonstrations by the technical school, all 420 mu of corn in the team have been fully promoted, increasing production by 20%. The intercropping methods created by the technical school, such as "using a line to lead the surface" (i.e., planting a row of tall-stalk crops on the edge of a ridge of low-stalk crops) and "using a point to lead the surface," have been rapidly promoted in dozens of production teams. Among them, the intercropping of wheat and corn alone can increase grain production by more than 20,000 jin per team. More importantly, the technical school closely combines with the production needs of the commune in various periods, often organizes students to go to the production team to serve as technical guidance, and solves problems in production at any time.

In terms of teaching methods, field practice is the main focus, combined with practical operation, to learn technical knowledge. The content of teaching, on the one hand, is that theory is closely linked to production practice. For example, at present, we talk about wheat regreening and cotton and corn sowing. After the lecture, we go to practice, and then take the things from the field to the small laboratory for observation and analysis, so that students can get "two understandings," "two abilities," and "one firmness." That is, understanding the operating technology, understanding the scientific principles; hands will do it, mouth will explain it; remember it firmly. On the other hand, there is also a certain system for explaining the theory. For example, botany, wheat and cotton cultivation are systematically explained, and in a certain production season, we go to combine the characteristics of seasonal production. The method of systematic learning is to learn less when busy and learn more when idle, and to learn collectively on rainy days. Field practice also has key points: first, to serve large-field production, such as preventing rust, preventing lodging, fertilizing, and irrigating; second, scientific experiments and research, focusing on solving problems such as variety, close planting, cotton boll drop, field design, light experiments, and intercropping.

Combining Inheritance, Creation, and Popularization

Our school has combined inheritance, creation, and popularization from the beginning, and combined indigenous and foreign methods. The teachers who lecture include county agricultural technicians, teachers and students from the Northwest Agricultural College who have been sent to work and train, and local experts and old farmers. In this way, the experiences of local experts and old farmers are summarized, systematically improved, and reduced to theory, inherited, and applied to production. We learn what predecessors have, and we create what they don't have. We have successively conducted twelve large-scale surveys throughout the commune, and conducted experimental research based on the problems encountered in the survey and internship. In 1958, there were fifty-three experimental research topics, and in 1959, there were forty-seven more. However, thousands of items and eyes are all around the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture. In terms of the indigenous aspect, there are comparative deep plowing experiments with different depths; in terms of fertilizer, there are experiments with different quantities, different types, and different fertilization methods; in terms of water, there are experiments on irrigation time, irrigation methods, and irrigation water volume; in terms of seeds, there are comparative observations and variety hybridization experiments of more than 300 wheat varieties, 12 corn varieties, and 24 cotton varieties, and so on. And we experiment, summarize, and promote at the same time. In the past year or so, we have held seven short-term training courses, with more than 400 people participating in the learning. At the same time, students have also made thirty-two technical presentations to twenty-nine production teams, which have played a certain role in promoting technology and guiding production.

"Universally Red, Specialize in Subjects"

Our school, from the beginning of the school year, followed the method of "universally red, specialize in subjects, and learn culture in separate classes," combining political and cultural learning with science and technology. Politics is the soul of technology. Through political classes, we conducted current affairs and policy education, carried out debates in light of ideological reality, and improved students' political awareness and enthusiasm for learning to ensure that technology serves proletarian politics. The learning methods are: first, to fix the time, grasp the proportion, and systematically learn. We have already studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "On Practice"; second, whoever comes, we invite them to speak. When the responsible comrades of the Party Committee and the Communist Youth League come to the commune, we invite them to make reports; third, we combine political lectures when teaching technical classes, such as discussing where close planting comes from, who put forward the Eight-Character Charter, so as to link to learning Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we also combine dialectical materialism, such as too dense or too sparse is not good, the relationship between close planting and deep plowing, and so on. When summarizing technical experience, we conclude that there are three harvests: ideology, technology, and yield; we conclude that it is the victory of the Party's leadership, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; we conclude that it is the victory of the socialist system and the struggle between the two roads. Therefore, the political and ideological level of the students has been greatly improved, and everyone said: "The redder the thought, the brighter the heart, and the brighter the heart, the greater the effort." Culture is a condition for technology. Among our students, more than 30 were originally illiterate or semi-illiterate, and they felt that there were three difficulties in learning technology without culture: it was difficult to understand the terms, it was difficult to understand the materials, and it was difficult to take notes. In order to solve this problem, we adopted the method of walking on two legs: one is to divide the students into two classes according to their cultural level and open cultural classes to learn culture; the other is to combine learning technology and learning culture more. For example, when talking about deep plowing, we recognize the four characters "deep plowing the land." After more than a year, 33 illiterate and semi-illiterate students reached the primary school level, 26 primary school students reached the higher primary school level, and 5 higher primary school students have improved to the level of junior high school graduates.

In short, our agricultural technical school has not only learned culture and technology, carried out scientific experiments and research, but also studied politics and improved ideological understanding, not only cultivated agricultural technical forces, but also promoted the development of production. However, under the situation of strengthening the agricultural front in every possible way and strengthening agricultural technical transformation, agricultural production will inevitably develop faster and at a higher speed. Therefore, the achievements we have already made and the technical forces we have cultivated are still far from meeting the needs. We must, under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the General Line, continue to rely on the People's Communes, rely on the strength and wisdom of the broad masses of commune members, further run agricultural technical schools well, cultivate more agricultural science and technology talents who are both red and expert, and strive for the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and for accelerating the modernization of agriculture.

    我们公社的农业技术学校
    王保京代表谈烽火人民公社社员怎样提高科学技术水平各位代表：
    听了三位副总理的报告，对我启发鼓舞极大。我衷心拥护。的确，不坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社，要取得去年继续大跃进的伟大成就是不可能的。我是陕西乾县烽火人民公社的社员，别的不讲，单就我们公社创办的农业技术学校这件事情来说，如果没有人民公社，要想办起来，是很困难的；即是办起来，也是很难办好的。
    在公社化以前，我们几个青年农民，就照着毛主席指示“敢想、敢说、敢干”的精神，在党和政府的支持下，搞试验田、搞农业科学研究。当时搞的还算不坏。可是1958年农业生产上出现了大跃进，我们那样的试验研究就赶不上形势的需要。土地劳力不能固定，记载总结也不系统；小村小社，参观传授都不方便；住训练班也只能是三天四天，复杂的一时学不会，何况很多农业技术都要在实践中反复学习才能掌握，不然，就会经常发生问题；试验成功的丰产经验，也不能很快的大面积地推广。那时乡党委考虑了这些情况，从各农业社选派了三十四名青年，搞了个专业试验队，专搞试验研究。但是有的农业社却认为是把自己的劳力抽去给别的社做庄稼，不愿叫青年参加试验研究。后来，人民公社化了，三十八个农业社组成了一个人民公社。政社合一了，组织规模大了，动员和安排劳力都比原来的农业社方便的多，合理的多。给大搞农业科学研究创造了有利的条件。因之，没有几天功夫，我们就在原来专业试验队的摊摊上很快的办起了一个农业技术学校。这个学校，不但是靠人民公社办起来了，而且依靠人民公社的力量得到了迅速的发展。学校的规模大了，劳力、土地都固定了，学员也增加了，一下增加到七十四人，试验的土地扩大到一百八十四亩。大家都觉得有了奔头，大鼓干劲，大搞试验，经过一年的奋斗，解决了生产上许多技术问题，创造了好几种高额丰产经验，解决了复种玉米和原茬小麦争地的矛盾，促进了公社生产的发展。更重要的是已经培养了一批农业技术骨干。毕业的六十七人，都能运用农业的“八字宪法”去指导麦、棉、玉米的丰产，都能运用小区对比试验的方法，解决生产中的技术问题。不少的学员还熟悉了杂交育种技术和田间记载方法，初步懂得了杂交育种的科学道理。因之，他们毕业回队以后，有的担任了生产队的技术员，有的担任了技校教员，有的担任了专业试验队的队长。并且他们还新办了七个农业技术分校，参加学习的有七百多人，建立了三百二十一个专业试验队，又搞了三百多项小区对比试验。
      既是学校，又是农场
    在短短的一年多的时间里，我们的农业技术学校已经发展成为一个以试验性生产为主的，生产、学习和科学研究三结合的学校。既是学校，又是试验农场，既是集中学习，又不脱离生产，既能提高学员的文化技术水平，开展科学研究，又能直接促进当前的生产。我们的学校，在学习方法上，采取了边上课边实践，上了课再实践，实践了再上课的办法，不仅使学员牢固地掌握了课堂知识，能够运用；而且也给田间操作找到了理论根据，能够及时提高。因之，毕业学员的技术知识和实际操作能力，一般都达到了初级技术水平，20％的达到了中等技术水平。他们能搞品种杂交、能布置试验，能作田间调查和有关的分析化验，也能写出试验总结。由于学习和生产直接结合，同生产队有密切联系，不仅有效地学习了农业技术，还又快又好地推广了先进经验。比如：玉米文武行子的丰产经验，过去只推广了百分之二十多，经过技校的经常示范，全队四百二十亩玉米已经全部推广，增产20％。技校创造的“以线带面”（即一畦低秆作物的边缘种上一行高秆作物）、“以点带面”等套种方法，在几十个生产队里都得到了很快的推广。其中小麦套种玉米一项，即使每队增产粮食两万多斤。更重要的是技术学校紧紧地结合了公社各个时期生产的需要，经常组织学员到生产队去，充当技术指导，随时解决生产中的问题。
    在教学方法上，是以田间实习为主，结合实际操作，学习技术知识。教学的内容，一方面是理论密切联系生产实际。比如在目前，就讲小麦返青，棉花、玉米播种。讲了以后，就去实习，然后再把地里的东西拿到小化验室观察分析，这样使学员得到“两懂”、“两会”和“一牢”。就是懂了操作技术，懂了科学道理；手会、嘴会；记的牢。另一方面，讲理论也有一定的系统。比如植物学、麦棉栽培学都是系统的讲，到了一定的生产季节，再去结合季节生产的特点。系统学习的方法是忙时少学，闲时多学，雨天集中学。田间实习也有重点，一是为大田生产服务，如防治锈病，防倒伏，施肥，灌溉等；二是科学试验研究，着重解决品种、密植、棉花落蕾、田间设计、光照试验和套种等问题。
    继承、创造、普及相结合
    我们的学校一开始就把继承、创造和普及结合起来，把土洋结合起来。讲课的教员有县的农业技术干部，有西北农学院下放劳动锻炼的师生，也有土专家和老农。这样就把土专家和老农中的经验总结起来，加以系统提高，归结到理论，继承下来，应用于生产。前人有的我们就学，没有的我们就创造。我们先后在全社范围内作过十二次大型调查，根据调查和实习中碰到的问题，进行试验研究。1958年试验研究的题目五十三项，1959年又有四十七项。但是，千项万目都是围绕着农业的“八字宪法”。在土的方面，有不同深度的对比深翻试验；肥的方面，有不同数量，不同种类及不同施肥方法的试验；水的方面，有灌溉时期，灌溉方法及灌溉水量的试验；种的方面，有三百多个小麦品种，十二个玉米品种，二十四个棉花品种的对比观察和品种杂交试验，等等。并且边试验，边总结，边推广。一年多来，我们举办过七次短期训练班，有四百多人参加了学习。同时学员还分别到二十九个生产队里作了三十二次技术传授，对推广技术，指导生产都起了一定的作用。
    “普遍红、分科专”
    我们的学校，一开学就按照“普遍红、分科专和分班学文化”的方法，把政治文化学习和科学技术结合起来。政治是技术的灵魂。我们通过政治课，进行了时事、政策的教育，结合思想实际，开展辩论，提高学员的政治觉悟和学习的积极性，以保证技术为无产阶级政治服务。学习的方法：一是固定时间，掌握比例，系统的学。已经学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和“实践论”，二是谁来就请谁讲，党委、团委的负责同志来社时，就请他们作报告；三是讲技术课时都要结合讲政治，如讲密植，就讨论密植那里来，八字宪法是谁提出来的，这样就联系到学习毛主席思想。同时也结合着讲辩证唯物主义，如过密过稀都不行、密植和深翻的关系等等。在总结技术经验时，就归结到思想、技术、产量三丰收；归结到党的领导、总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利；归结到社会主义制度和两条道路斗争的胜利。因之大大地提高了学员的政治思想水平，大家都说：“思想越红心越亮，心里越亮劲越大”。文化是技术的条件。在我们的学员中，原来有三十多人是文盲和半文盲，他们感到没有文化学习技术有三难：听不懂名词难，看不懂材料难，记不成笔记难。为了解决这个问题，我们采取了两条腿走路的办法，一个是按照学员的文化程度，分成两班，开了文化课，学习文化；一个是更多的结合学习技术学习文化。如讲深翻时，就认“深翻土地”四个字，经过一年多的时间，使三十三名文盲和半文盲学员，达到了初小程度，二十六名初小程度的学员，达到了高小程度，五名高小程度的，已提高到初中毕业的水平。
    总之，我们的农业技术学校，既学了文化技术，进行科学试验研究，又学习了政治，提高了思想认识，既培养了农业技术力量，又促进了生产的发展。但是，在千方百计加强农业战线，加强农业技术改造的形势下，农业生产必将以更快的、更高的速度向前发展，因此，我们已经取得的成绩和培养出来的技术力量，还是远远不能适应需要的。我们一定要在党的领导下，认真贯彻执行总路线，继续依靠人民公社，依靠广大社员的力量和智慧，进一步办好农业技术学校，培养更多的又红又专的农业科学技术人才，为农业生产的持续大跃进，为加速农业的现代化而斗争。
