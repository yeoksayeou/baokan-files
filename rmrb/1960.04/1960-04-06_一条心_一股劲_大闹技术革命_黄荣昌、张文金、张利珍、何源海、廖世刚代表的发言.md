Comrades:
    We wholeheartedly endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian to the congress.
    Now, we will report to the congress on the situation of the Chongqing City's entire workforce, who have set ambitious goals and are vigorously engaged in the "Four Transformations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) movement.

    Chongqing Workers Are Determined and Ambitious, Determined to Make One Factory Equivalent to Several, One Person Equivalent to Several
    In the spring of 1960, Chongqing's industry, based on the great victory of the Great Leap Forward last year, is again in a situation of continued leap forward. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, we, following the instruction of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee to "grasp tightly from the beginning and grasp tightly throughout," are holding high the red flag of continuous revolution and taking even greater strides in the Great Leap Forward. We fired the first shot of the 1960s in industrial production and won a great victory in the "Open Door Red" of 1960. On the city's industrial front, a vibrant situation of sustained leap forward has emerged. In January, the total industrial output value completed 109.39% of the state plan, an increase of 69.32% compared to the same period last year. In February, it completed 100.61% of the state plan, an increase of 85.95% compared to the same period last year. The city's workforce completed the first quarter's total industrial output value plan seven days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 1.02%. The current situation is getting better and better, with factories united as one, galloping forward, and everywhere is vibrant and full of new life.
    Since November of last year, a comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on the "Four Transformations," has quickly spread like wildfire throughout Chongqing City. The vast workforce is full of ambition and soaring enthusiasm, vigorously engaging in technical revolution and technical innovation, with frequent reports of success. A new situation has emerged: "People are not quiet late at night, innovation is happening everywhere, automation is in batches, and mechanization is in groups." By late March, the city's industry (including machinery and transportation) had achieved 30,317 manual operation semi-mechanization projects, 14,718 mechanization projects, 7,301 single-machine semi-automation units, 2,537 automation units, 803 production automatic lines, and 577 linkage projects. The degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization in the city's factories and mines has increased from 32.2% at the end of November last year to 57.1%, an average increase of 2.2% every ten days. Since February, the increase has been even more significant, averaging 4.24% every ten days. Among the sixteen major types of machinery, 47.7% of the machine tools have achieved semi-automation and automation. The phenomenon of "old factories being renovated and new factories being renewed daily" and "one factory being equivalent to several, and one person being equivalent to several" has become widespread throughout the city. Due to the comprehensive development of technical innovation and technical revolution, a large number of new technologies and new experiences have also emerged. The use of the new technology of "double-trough four-package" in open-hearth steelmaking has increased steel production by 30% since March. Some factories use hot-air multi-zone pig iron furnaces, which, calculated by layer of coke, increase the amount of pig iron produced per ton of coke by an average of thirty-six times, fundamentally improving labor conditions and ensuring safe production. At the same time, employees in agriculture, finance, trade, culture, education, government agencies, and other fields are also enthusiastically carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, with many innovative initiatives emerging. In rural areas, more than 300 canteens have been transformed from three to seven cooks in the past to one-person canteens, and more than 300 livestock farms have achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization. After the complete mechanization of the Wulidian Livestock Farm in Jiangbei District, the average number of pigs raised per person increased from 210 to 458; the youth pig raising team averaged 1,500 pigs per person. The degree of mechanization of grain processing in the city has reached 98%, and 22 grain stations have achieved a "transport, storage, factory, store" integrated linkage. The storage company's 18 warehouses created semiconductor long-distance automatic temperature and humidity measurement, automatic alarm devices, infrared moisture meters, and the employees of Shaanxi Street Warehouse achieved a
   "seven-prevention" safety automatic control line for fire prevention, moisture prevention, heat prevention, theft prevention, vandalism prevention, rain prevention, and wind prevention. One safety duty officer can control eight large and small warehouses in the entire district and can direct and dispatch the forces of each warehouse to prevent various accidents within three seconds. All eighty-eight medium and large restaurants in the city have achieved semi-mechanization, mechanization, and steam linkage.

    The "Four Transformations" Movement Brings: Increased Production Without Increasing Manpower, and Even Reducing Manpower
    Our "Four Transformations" movement focuses on achieving semi-mechanization and mechanization of manual operations, first grasping the link of saving labor. From December of last year to now, the city's industrial front has saved more than 68,000 workers due to the improvement of mechanization and automation. The transportation department of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's transportation volume this year increased by 60% compared to last year, and it was originally planned to add 1,600 people in the first quarter of this year. In the Four Transformations movement, not only was "increased production without increasing manpower" achieved, but labor was saved by 740 people. Our workers call the realization of mechanization of manual operations the "second liberation." Everyone is spirited and ambitious, and many moving deeds have emerged. A Communist Youth League member of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's refractory materials factory, despite being ill, traveled all over Chongqing to find materials and treasures, and mechanized the transportation of refractory bricks within two days. In a factory, three out of every ten screw rods produced by a youth work area were scrapped, and seven needed repair. Over the past seven years, more than sixty people have carried out more than one hundred "encirclements and suppressions" of this "roadblock," but no thorough solution has been achieved. This time, a young worker was inspired by the barber's shears and quickly manufactured an indigenous machine to subdue this "roadblock," increasing efficiency by fifteen times. Five veteran workers in this work area, after three days and nights of hard work, transformed an almost one-hundred-year-old "old hexagonal car" into automation, ending its history of being "cumbersome, laborious, and difficult to operate."
    In this great movement, we, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have further broken down superstitions, liberated our minds, dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to do. We want to learn from foreign advanced technologies, and if foreign countries don't have them, we will create them ourselves. The entire workforce of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's mechanization workshop, most of whom are not very literate, but under the cultivation and care of the Party, some have grown from ordinary carpenters to mechanical engineers. In this movement, they relied on their own efforts, started from scratch, and, focusing on the key to production, designed and created eight large pieces of equipment, including a pig iron furnace charging machine, a large pig iron crushing machine, and a Jiangbian rotary crane, through three-way combination design and creation. After all these equipments are put into production and play their full effect, they can save the country 1.25 million workdays per year.

    If Possible, Use Foreign Methods; If Not Possible, Use Indigenous Methods, and Use Indigenous Methods to Produce a Large Number of Mechanized Equipment
    The Party's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods has pointed out the direction of high-speed development for us. If possible, use foreign methods; if possible, use indigenous methods. Indigenous methods should be implemented first. Everyone uses indigenous methods and poor methods to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. For example, the Changjiang Fiber Factory in the Shizhong District is a small factory with only 180 production workers, and 95% of the operations are manual. There is not a single technical worker in the entire factory who understands machinery, and not even a pair of pliers. But difficulties cannot stop their lofty ambitions. An old worker said: For the sake of the next generation and for the sake of socialism, I will do my best to build two machines. With this spirit, relying on two borrowed pliers and an old hand-cranked drill, they used nan bamboo and wood to replace steel, and hemp rope as a belt. Many workers took out the soup spoons, fire tongs, tables, and benches from their homes, and some workers even persuaded their elders to donate their stored wood to engage in the "Four Transformations." They sought teachers and friends everywhere, traveled to all the textile factories in the city, and went to Suining three times and Santai four times to learn from experience. After more than a month of hard work, the entire factory achieved mechanization. In the silk spinning workshop of this factory, 24 people used to produce 70 kilograms per month, but now 21 people produce 700 kilograms per month, increasing labor productivity by more than twelve times. The weaving workshop increased from one person watching one weaving machine to one person watching three weaving machines, and the monthly output increased from 40,000 meters to 130,000 meters, increasing labor productivity by 3.8 times.

    The Enthusiasm Is Getting Higher and Higher, and the Brains Are Getting More and More Agile, Overcoming Cutting-Edge Technologies
    Just like previous revolutionary movements, it is not smooth sailing. A few people stand on the opposing side, criticizing in every way possible. But we have the correct leadership of the Party, the urgent requirement to quickly change the country's "poverty and blankness," and we want to create. No criticism can stop us from moving forward, it can only further inspire our enthusiasm. After a period of hard work, we finally successfully tested a cutting-edge technology. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the liberated Chinese working class not only has infinite wisdom and great creative ability, but also is never afraid of difficulties and is fearless. The enthusiasm of our working class is getting higher and higher, and our brains are getting more and more agile. We can withstand the test of any arduous struggle.
    The "Four Transformations" movement has promoted a further surge in productivity and has also brought an increasingly prosperous new look to enterprise management. Particularly significant is the further development of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." Cadres have generally adopted the method of "dividing lines, setting points, dividing areas, and contracting," delving into the front line targeting the key to production and weak links, and planting experimental fields on a large scale. Workers generally reflect: cadres take the lead in charging forward, bravely tackling key problems and seizing positions, everyone delves into production, and everything relies on the masses. Through participating in labor and planting experimental fields, not only do they promptly solve the key to production, organize new balances, adjust labor organization, and strengthen planned management together with the masses, but they also summarize the experience of the masses and incorporate it into technical procedures, strengthen technical management, and universally transform and reform the original equipment and product designs through the three-way combination method.
    Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, although the entire workforce of Chongqing City has made some achievements, it is still far behind the advanced regions in the country, especially compared to our grand goals. Our work in all aspects is still very inadequate. Our city's workers are enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Provincial First Session of the Third Party Congress to "fight with one heart, one mind, and one style to achieve the Great Leap Forward in 1960," and are enthusiastically launching the "One Style" movement. Everyone is learning from the advanced, and everyone is learning from the advanced. Holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, with one heart, one mind, and one style, we are striding forward along the path of technical innovation and technical revolution, towards the great goals of the 1960s!

    一条心　一股劲　大闹技术革命
    黄荣昌、张文金、张利珍、何源海、廖世刚代表的发言各位代表：
    我们衷心拥护李富春、李先念副总理向大会所作的报告。
    现在，我们把重庆市全体职工立雄心壮志大搞“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）运动的情况向大会作个汇报。
    重庆职工志壮心雄，定叫一厂顶数厂，一人顶数人
    1960年的春季，重庆市的工业，在去年大跃进的伟大胜利基础上又是一个继续跃进的形势。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们遵循着中共四川省委“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的指示，高举不断革命的红旗，迈开更大跃进的步伐，在工业生产上打响了六十年代第一炮，夺得了1960年开门红的巨大胜利。全市工业战线上，出现了一个持续跃进的生动局面。1月份，工业总产值完成国家计划的109.39％，比去年同期增长69.32％，2月份完成国家计划100.61％，比去年同期增长85.95％。全市职工提前七天超额1.02％完成了第一季度工业总产值计划。目前的形势越来越好，厂厂万众一心，万马奔腾，处处万紫千红，万象更新。
    自去年11月以来，一个以“四化”为中心的全面的技术革新和技术革命运动，星火燎原般地很快就燃遍了全重庆市。广大职工人人志壮心雄，干劲冲天，大搞技术革命和技术革新，喜报频传，出现了“夜深人不静，处处闹革新，自动化成批，机械化成群”的崭新局面。到3月下旬，全市工业（包括机械、交通）共实现手工操作半机械化三万零三百一十七项，机械化一万四千七百一十八项，单机半自动化七千三百零一台，自动化二千五百三十七台，生产自动线八百零三条，联动化五百七十七项。全市厂矿企业半机械化和机械化的程度，已由去年11月底的32.2％提高到57.1％，平均每十天提高2.2％。2月份以来，上升更为显著，平均每十天提高4.24％。在十六个大机械中，已有47.7％的机床实现了半自动化和自动化。全市“老厂改新装，新厂日日新”“一厂顶数厂，一人顶数人”已经成为一种普遍的现象。由于技术革新和技术革命的全面发展，也出现了大量的新技术、新经验。炼钢大平炉运用“双槽四包”的新技术，3月份以来钢产量猛增了30％；有的工厂采用热风多带化铁炉，按层焦计算，平均使一吨焦化铁的数量提高三十六倍。并且从根本上改善了劳动条件，保证安全生产。与此同时，在农业、财贸、文教、机关等各个方面的职工，都轰轰烈烈地开展了技术革新、技术革命运动，出现了许多革新创举。农村有三百多个食堂由过去三至七个炊事员变成一人食堂，有三百多个畜牧场实现了半机械化、机械化。江北区五里店畜牧场全部机械化以后，每人养猪平均由二百一十头提高到四百五十八头；青年养猪队平均每人达到一千五百头。全市粮食加工机械化程度已达到98％，有二十二个粮站实现了“运、仓、厂、店”一条龙联动化。仓储公司十八个仓库创造了半导体远距离自动测温、测湿、自动报警器、红外线水分测定器，陕西街仓库的职工实现了一条防火、防潮、防热、防盗、防破坏、防雨、防风的
  “七防”安全自动控制线。一个安全值班员可以控制全区大、小、八个仓库，三秒钟内可以指挥调度各仓库的力量，制止各种事故。全市八十八个中型和大型餐厅已全部实现半机械化、机械化和蒸气联动化。
    “四化”运动带来：增产不增人，增产还要减人
    我们的“四化”运动以实现手工操作半机械化和机械化为重点，首先抓住节约劳动力这一环。去年12月到现在，全市工业战线上由于机械化、自动化程度的提高，已节约劳动力六万八千多人。重钢运输部今年的运量比去年增长了60％，原计划今年第一季度要增加一千六百人。在四化运动中，不但做到了“增产不增人”，反而节省了劳动力七百四十个。我们工人把实现手工操作机械化称为“第二次解放”。人人意气风发，雄心勃勃，出现了很多动人的事迹。重钢耐火材料厂就有一个共青团员，带病跑遍重庆各地寻材访宝，两天内就搞起了耐火砖运输机械化。有个厂子青年工区的一种螺旋杆原每生产十个就有三个报废，七个需要修理。七年来，先后有六十多人对这只“拦路虎”进行了一百多次围剿，都没有得到彻底解决。这次，有一个青年工人在理发时从发剪上得到启发，很快制造出一部土机器，把这只“拦路虎”降服了，提高了工效十五倍。这个工区有五个老工人，经过了三天的日夜苦战，把一部将近一百年来的“老六角车”改成为自动化，结束了它那“笨重费力，难于操作”的历史。
    在这个伟大的运动中，我们遵循着毛主席的教导，进一步破除迷信，解放思想敢想敢说敢做，外国先进的，我们要学，外国没有的，我们就创造，重钢机械化车间的全体职工，大多数都识字不多，但他们在党的培养和关怀下，有人已从普通木工成长为机械工程师，在这次运动中他们自力更生，白手起家，针对生产关键，三结合设计和创造了化铁炉进料机，大型生铁破碎机，江边旋转起重机等八台大型设备，这些设备投入生产全部发挥效力后，每年即可为国家节约一百二十五万个劳动日。
    能洋就洋不能洋就土，用土办法搞成大批机械化设备
    党的土洋并举的方针，为我们指出了高速度发展的方向，能洋就洋，能土就土，土法先上马，大家用土办法、穷办法搞半机械化、机械化，如市中区长江纤维厂，是一个只有一百八十个生产工人的小厂，95％是手工操作。全厂没有一个懂机械的技术工人，连一把老虎钳也没有。但困难挡不住他们的雄心大志，有个老工人说：为了下一代，为了社会主义，我拼命也要搞两部机器出来。就凭这股干劲，靠借来的两把老虎钳和一台旧手摇钻，用楠竹、木材代钢材，麻绳当皮带，不少工人把自己家里的汤瓢、火钳、桌子、板凳都拿出来，有个工人甚至说服自己的老人把存放的木材也献出来搞“四化”。他们到处寻师访友，走遍全市所有的纺织厂，并三上遂宁，四上三台，取经学艺，苦战一个多月，全厂实现了机械化。这个厂的丝纺车间，原来二十四人月产七十公斤，现在二十一人月产七百公斤，劳动生产率提高十二倍多；织布车间由一人看一台布机提高到一人看三台布机，月产量由四万米提高到十三万米，劳动生产率提高三点八倍。
    干劲越来越大，脑子越用越灵，攻下了尖端技术
    正像历次的革命运动一样，不是一帆风顺的，有少数人站在反对方面，他们多方非难百般挑剔。可是我们有党的正确领导，有迅速改变祖国“一穷二白”的状况的迫切要求，我们要创造，任何非难也不能阻挡我们前进，只能更加激发我们的干劲。经过一段时期的辛勤劳动，终于把一项尖端技术试验成功了。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，解放了的中国工人阶级，不仅有无穷的智慧和伟大的创造能力，而且从来不怕困难，无所畏惧，我们工人阶级的干劲越来越大，脑子越用越灵。我们经得起任何艰苦斗争的考验。
    “四化”运动促进了生产力的进一步高涨，也给企业管理带来了日益繁荣的新面貌。特别显著的是“两参一改三结合”有了进一步的发展。干部普遍采取了“分线定点，划片包干”的办法，针对生产关键和薄弱环节深入第一线，大种试验田。工人普遍反映：干部带头冲锋，勇猛攻关夺阵，人人深入生产，事事依靠群众。通过一条龙的参加劳动和种试验田，不仅和群众一起及时解决了生产关键，组织了新的平衡，调整了劳动组织和加强了计划管理，同时还用三结合的方法把群众的经验总结起来纳入技术规程，加强技术管理，并普遍对原有的设备和产品设计进行了改造和改革。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们重庆市全体职工虽然作出了一些成绩，但是和全国各先进地区比较起来，特别是和我们的宏伟目标比较起来还差得远，我们现在各方面的工作都还作得很不够。我们全市工人正热烈地响应省一届三次党代大会提出的“全党一条心，一股劲，一个样，为实现1960年的大跃进而奋斗”的伟大的号召，轰轰烈烈地开展了“一个样”运动。人人向先进学习，个个向先进看齐。高举毛泽东思想的红旗，一条心，一股劲，一个样的沿着技术革新和技术革命的道路，向着六十年代的伟大目标，昂首阔步，奋勇前进！
