Seeing the Enthusiasm of the Masses, Receiving Great Education
CPPCC National Committee Member Song Yunbin Discusses His Experiences from Visits and Studies

    We studied the three reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and felt extremely excited. Through the study and discussion of these three reports, we gained a clearer understanding of the rapid growth and great leap forward of our powerful socialist industrialized motherland; we gained a clearer understanding of the noble qualities of the hundreds of millions of working people on all fronts who are full of energy, selflessly working, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and have a new spiritual outlook. I was reminded of two lines from Chairman Mao's poem: "Spring breeze touches myriad willows, and the six hundred million of China are all sages." In his great poem, Chairman Mao vividly depicted the infinitely beautiful prospects of the motherland and praised the hundreds of millions of working people on all fronts with a new spiritual outlook.
    Over the past year, the National Committee of the CPPCC has organized committee members in Beijing several times to visit factories, people's communes, and water conservancy projects in the suburbs of Beijing and other places, greatly enriching our perceptual knowledge. Especially recently, I participated in a visiting group to Henan, where we visited several large factories directly under the central government and local industries, as well as small and medium-sized factories run by communes in Luoyang and Zhengzhou. We visited people's communes in urban and suburban areas, and the Sanmenxia and Garden Mouth water conservancy hub projects on the Yellow River. Not only did it broaden our horizons, but it also opened our minds, with great gains and deep feelings. Therefore, when I studied the three reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, I felt particularly close and easy to understand. During group discussions, committee members from other places shared their experiences from inspections and visits. I also briefly talked about some of my experiences. To avoid repetition, I will now combine my specific work and ideological situation to talk about the following two points.
    First, I am a bourgeois intellectual who has committed serious mistakes and has not been well reformed. Since the anti-Rightist struggle, I have gradually recognized the seriousness of the mistakes I made in the past, and gradually changed my attitude towards new things through study. I have developed feelings for new things and confidence in the inevitable victory of new things. However, because the roots of my class background have not been completely eradicated, I often recognize a certain mistake, but then make mistakes in my views on a certain new thing. For example, when studying the general line last year, some people believed that while the industrial and agricultural fronts could achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, the cultural front could not. At that time, I combined my specific work and felt that this view also made sense. My specific work is sorting out ancient books. The so-called "sorting out" involves punctuation, collation, annotation, and translation. I believe that this kind of work can only be done by one person working alone, and it must be done carefully, so "more and faster" cannot be "better and more economical." Later, I realized that socialist construction must develop at a high speed, and the cultural front would certainly not be an exception. The saying that "more and faster" cannot be "better and more economical" is of course wrong, but I couldn't find the answer to where the mistake lies for a while. Through visits, seeing the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial and agricultural fronts, just as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, "new people and new things are emerging one after another, innovations are blooming everywhere, and the communist style is being further developed," I suddenly realized. It turns out that the key to achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results lies in technical innovation and technical revolution, and the cultural front can also engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. It's just that old intellectuals like me, looking at problems from an individualistic perspective, cannot see this point. Take sorting out ancient books as an example. Old intellectuals in the past also did a lot of work and had their achievements, like the so-called "Qianlong and Jiaqing scholars." They regarded this work as their personal "work for posterity," always doing it slowly, taking a lifetime to achieve something. Now, if we still hold that old position and old viewpoint, we cannot talk about technical innovation and technical revolution, let alone mutual support and cooperation, etc. If our position changes and our thinking is straightened out, we will understand that working collectively is better than working alone. As long as we cooperate well, one person can definitely be as effective as ten people. If we understand this point, we will naturally put down the arrogant airs of old intellectuals, trust the masses, follow the mass line, and use the wisdom of the masses to engage in technical innovation and continuously improve work efficiency. If we understand this point, we will naturally go all out, aim high, and strive for more, faster, better, and more economical results. Here, I realized that all kinds of wrong ideas and views are not just a matter of understanding, but a matter of position and class prejudice, and also a matter of world outlook. Standing on the bourgeois position and looking at problems with the bourgeois world outlook, the resulting understanding is of course all wrong.
    Second, through many visits, everyone felt that the situation is pressing, and it is necessary to strengthen self-transformation, especially for those like me who have committed serious mistakes. I have carefully examined the changes in my ideological situation in recent years. Since the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, I initially admitted my mistakes, and further recognized my mistakes. This recognition of mistakes has gradually deepened through multiple visits and long-term study. For example, during several visits, I saw that the vast majority of leaders in large and small factories were not experts originally. Because they put politics in command, they not only led well, but also quickly became experts themselves. I recalled that I once said "laymen cannot lead experts," and adopted an attitude of ridicule, criticism, and even attacking new things. What a serious crime! Also, after visiting the two people's communes in Luoyang and Zhengzhou, and listening to the reports of provincial and municipal leaders, saying that since the establishment of people's communes in Luoyang and Zhengzhou, 55,000 laborers have been liberated. Thousands upon thousands of housewives have been liberated, many have become technical workers, and at the same time, people's mental outlook and social relations have been changed, and conditions for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas have been created. I recalled that a year ago, I also had some unnecessary concerns about organizing people's communes in cities, such as fearing that I would not get used to eating in the canteen and living a collective life. Obviously, that was thinking from an individualistic perspective, trying to live a leisurely petty-bourgeois life forever. Isn't this still a matter of position? Seeing the current new things, recalling the past, I have a further understanding of the mistakes of the past. The more profound the understanding, the more urgent the demand for transforming myself. I think that the self-transformation of a person like me must go through a forced stage before entering a conscious stage. At first, I admitted my mistakes completely under duress, and later gradually recognized my various mistakes, with a little bit of conscious element. Of course, this is far from enough, and I must continue to improve my consciousness, mainly by studying Chairman Mao's works. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report pointed out, "Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future." For the self-transformation of intellectuals, seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to change our position, that is, to change our world outlook in the future. Theoretical study must also be combined with practice. For intellectuals like me to be transformed, we must honestly gain understanding from practice. In a factory in Luoyang, I saw a slogan: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times, doing once is better than seeing a hundred times." This is very educational for me.
    Fellow members, having seen the infinitely beautiful prospects of the motherland, having seen the thousands upon thousands of working people on all fronts bravely striving to be the first and working energetically for the cause of socialist construction, can I still not correct my past mistakes, intensify my studies, and strive to transform myself into a new person? The situation is so pressing and so inspiring. I have great determination and confidence in my own transformation.
    Finally, I wish the conference a successful victory! I wish all members good health!

    看到群众干劲　受到极大教育
    宋云彬委员谈参观和学习中的体会
    我们学习了李富春副总理和李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的三个报告，感到异常兴奋。通过对这三个报告的学习和讨论，更清楚地认识到强大的社会主义工业化的祖国在迅速成长，飞跃发展；更清楚地认识到在各个战线上干劲冲天、忘我劳动、用毛泽东思想武装起来的、精神面貌一新的亿万劳动人民的高贵品质。我就想起毛主席的两句诗：“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”。毛主席在他的伟大的诗篇中形象地描绘了无限美好的祖国前景，也歌颂了各个战线上的精神面貌一新的亿万劳动人民。
    一年来，政协全国委员会几次组织在京委员，分别在北京近郊和到各地参观工厂、人民公社和水利工程，大大地丰富了我们的感性知识。尤其最近我参加到河南去的参观团，在洛阳和郑州参观了几个中央直属的大厂和地方工业以及社办工业的中小型厂，参观了城市和近郊的人民公社，参观了黄河三门峡和花园口水利枢纽工程，不但开了眼界，更开了思想，收获大，感受深。因此，我在学习李富春副总理和李先念副总理，和陈叔通副主席的三个报告的时候，就觉得特别亲切，容易领会。小组讨论的时候，从外地来的委员都把他们在视察、参观中所得到的体会结合起来谈。我也简要地谈过一些，为了避免重复，现在再结合我的具体工作和思想情况来谈谈下面的两点体会。
    第一，我是一个犯过严重错误，没有改造好的资产阶级知识分子。从反右斗争以来，我逐步认识到过去所犯错误的严重性，从学习中逐步改变了看待新事物的态度，对新事物有了感情，对新事物的必然胜利有了信心。但是由于阶级孽根没有完全挖掉，往往认识了某一点错误，却在对某一种新生事物的看法上又发生错误。例如去年学习总路线的时候，有些人认为工农业战线上可以做到多快好省，文化战线上就不可能，我当时结合自己的具体工作，觉得这种看法也有道理。我的具体工作是整理古书。所谓“整理”，就是标点、校勘、注释和翻译。我认为这种工作只能一个人埋头干，而且要仔仔细细地搞，所以“多快”就不能“好省”。后来认识到社会主义建设必须高速度发展，文化战线当然不会例外，那种“多快”不能“好省”的说法当然是错误的，但错误在哪里，一时却找不出答案来。通过参观，看到当前工农业战线上开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，正如李富春副总理报告中所说的“新人新事层出不穷，革新创举到处开花，共产主义风格更加发扬”，我才恍然大悟。原来多快好省的关键在技术革新和技术革命，而文化战线上也同样可以大闹技术革新和技术革命，只是像我那样的旧知识分子，看问题从个人出发，才会看不到这一点。就拿整理古书来讲吧，过去的旧知识分子也做过不少工作，也有他们的成就，像所谓“乾嘉学者”就是。他们是把这种工作当作个人的“名山事业”的，总是慢慢地搞，搞一辈子才搞出一点名堂来。现在我们如果还是那种旧立场、旧观点，当然谈不上技术革新和技术革命，更谈不上互相支援、互相配合等等。如果立场一改变，思想一搞通，就会懂得单干不如集体干，只要配合得好，一个人准可以顶上十个人。如果懂得了这一点，自然会放下旧知识分子自高自大的臭架子，相信群众，走群众路线，运用群众智慧来大搞技术革新，不断提高工作效率。如果懂得了这一点，自然会鼓足干劲、力争上游，做到多快好省。在这儿我体会到所有种种错误的想法和看法，不单单是认识问题，而是立场和阶级偏见的问题，也是世界观的问题。站在资产阶级立场，用资产阶级的世界观来看问题，所得到的认识当然都是错误的了。
    第二，通过好多次参观，大家感觉到形势逼人，非加强自我改造不可了，尤其是像我那样犯过严重错误的。我曾经细细检查过这几年来思想情况的变化。从1957年反右斗争以来，我最初是承认错误，进一步才认识错误，而认识错误也是从多次参观和长期学习中逐步深刻起来的。例如在几次的参观中，看到大小工厂的领导同志绝大多数原来不是专家，由于他们政治挂了帅，不但领导得很好，而且自己很快地就成了专家。我就回想到从前我曾经说过“外行不能领导内行”，对新生事物采取了讥讽、指责以至打击的态度，罪行何等严重！又如看了洛阳市和郑州市的两个人民公社，听了省市领导同志的报告，说洛阳市和郑州市自从成立人民公社以来，解放了五万五千个劳动力。千千万万的家庭妇女被解放出来，很多已经成为技术工人，同时也改变了人的精神面貌和社会关系，并创造了消灭城乡差别的条件。我回想到一年前我对城市组织人民公社也有过一些不必要的顾虑，如怕吃不惯食堂饭，过不惯集体生活，那显然是从个人打算，企图永远过着小资产阶级的悠闲生活。这还不是一个立场问题吗？看到当前的新事物，回忆过去，对过去的错误就有更进一步的认识，认识愈深刻，对改造自己的要求就愈迫切。我想，像我那样的一种人的自我改造，一定要经过强迫的阶段，才能进入自觉的阶段。我起初承认错误，完全是被迫的，后来逐步地认识自己的种种错误，多少带一点自觉的成分了。当然，这是很不够的，还得在不断提高自觉的基础上，主要是学习毛主席的著作。李富春副总理的报告中指出，“认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。”就知识分子的自我改造来说，认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得改变立场亦即改变世界观的根本保证。理论学习还得跟实践结合起来。像我这样的知识分子要得到改造，更非老老实实从实践中取得认识不可。在洛阳一个工厂中看到一条标语：“百闻不如一见，百见不如一干”。这对我来说，是富有教育意义的。
    各位委员，看到了无限美好的祖国的前景，看到了各个战线上千千万万劳动人民在奋勇争先地为社会主义建设事业鼓足干劲地工作，我还能够不痛改前非，加紧学习，努力把自己改造成为一个新人吗？形势如此逼人，也如此鼓舞人，我对于自己的改造，是具有极大的决心和信心的。
    最后祝大会胜利成功！各位委员身体健康！
