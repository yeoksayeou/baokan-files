Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In order to welcome the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth on April 22, socialist countries have launched various commemorative activities.

Labor competitions have been widely launched in various parts of the Soviet Union, along with activities commemorating Lenin. Commemorative activities began in various regions from January of this year. Local newspapers and periodicals have continuously published articles commemorating Lenin in large amounts. Labor competitions have been launched successively throughout the country.

The labor competition commemorating Lenin's birth has become an integral part of the competition throughout the Soviet Union to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and has achieved good results. Since the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Plant initiated the competition, each workshop has overfulfilled its production plan for two consecutive months. The Kosov work team of the Kuibyshev Bearing Plant, which initiated the competition, has completed its tasks with a score of more than 200% for three consecutive months. In this factory, more than 500 work teams participated in the competition for the title of "Communist Labor Team." The Mamadov drilling team in the Baku No. 1 oil region reached a new world record of 4,835 meters in drilling depth.

Report meetings, exhibitions, and other commemorative activities are being held everywhere. The Moscow Municipal Party Committee held a series of report meetings to introduce Lenin's life and revolutionary activities, calling on the people to intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism. Veteran Bolsheviks from all over the country have written articles recalling Lenin and gave reports in factories and collective farms. The Moscow Lenin Museum has been renovated and reopened, and the Soviet National Gallery held an exhibition of paintings and sculptures related to Lenin.

Publishing houses have successively published many new books about Lenin. "Collection of Documents Given to Lenin by the Working People" and "Memoirs of Meetings Between the Working People and Lenin" are among the books recently published.

Many regions and factories and enterprises will hold voluntary Sundays in April to commemorate Lenin's birth.

The Glukhov Cotton Textile Combine in the Moscow Oblast proposed to establish a fund for the working people to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth by increasing production and practicing economy. This initiative has been echoed by many factories and enterprises.

In Korea, a photo exhibition held in Pyongyang City to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth opened on the afternoon of the 6th.

Those who attended the opening ceremony included Korean Deputy Prime Minister Jeong Il-ryong, Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Lee Hyo-soon, Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Sung-cheol, and other party and government leaders, as well as diplomatic envoys to North Korea.

Li Ki-young, Chairman of the Korea-Soviet Friendship Association, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the Korean people should work hard to study Lenin's theories and bravely fight. He said that the current international situation shows that imperialism is about to perish, and the socialist camp is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong.

The exhibition displayed more than 300 photos about Lenin's revolutionary activities and the construction achievements of Korea and the Soviet Union.

All over Poland, activities commemorating Lenin's birth are combined with the promotion of Leninism. Scientific institutions, universities, political and social organizations have held academic conferences, report meetings, and seminars to expound Lenin's theories and Lenin's contribution to Marxism. At present, eight or nine cities, including Toruń, Krakow, and Poznań, have held report meetings to discuss many topics such as "Lenin and Socialist Democracy," "Lenin's Contributions to Education and Science," and "Lenin and Poland." Warsaw is scheduled to hold a large-scale academic report meeting of historians, economists, and philosophers in the near future to study Lenin's theoretical legacy.

National newspapers and periodicals have also successively published theoretical articles commemorating Lenin. The Polish "Books and Knowledge Publishing House" has recently published many pamphlets discussing and recalling Lenin, such as "Comrade Lenin" and "Lenin Lives Among Us."

Various regions also combine the commemoration of Lenin's birth with activities promoting Polish-Soviet friendship.

In Bulgaria, starting from the beginning of April, reports, discussions, symposiums, film screenings, and photo exhibitions will be held in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, state-owned farms, and agricultural cooperatives throughout the country. Newspapers and radio stations will publish and broadcast various commemorative articles and materials introducing Lenin's life, revolutionary deeds, and the victory of the great Leninist ideology. These commemorative activities are arranged in accordance with the spirit of the resolution on commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth passed by the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party in August last year. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the National Sofia University, the Advanced Party School of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Institute of Party History of the Bulgarian Communist Party will jointly hold a scientific conference on April 13. The conference will hear reports on "The Victory of Leninist Ideology at the Present Stage," "The Construction of a New Type of Political Party Under the Leninist Banner—The Bulgarian Communist Party," "Leninism and the National Liberation Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries," "Lenin on the Role of Science in Socialist and Communist Construction," "Lenin on Socialist Education and Its Connection with Productive Labor," "Lenin on the Role of Art in Socialist Construction," and "Lenin's Criticism of Opportunism—The Methodological Basis for the Struggle Against Modern Revisionism."
