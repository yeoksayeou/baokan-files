Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Literary and art circles in the capital today held a gathering to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the world cultural figure, Norwegian playwright Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Among those attending the commemoration were well-known figures from the capital's literary and art circles, including Lao She, Zhou Erfu, Ma Yanxiang, Li Bozhao, and over four hundred literary and art enthusiasts. Mr. Bøgh, a representative from the Norwegian Embassy in China, was invited to attend the commemoration.

The commemoration was presided over by Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association. In his speech, he said: Bjørnson was a Norwegian playwright of the same era as Ibsen, and had an enlightening influence on modern progressive culture. He was a fighter for Norway's national democratic struggle, fighting for the establishment of Norwegian national culture and striving for national independence. He also opposed capitalist powers invading weak countries, and was therefore also a famous peace fighter. Tian Han said that Bjørnson's works have their historical limitations, and we should further study this outstanding Nordic playwright from a new ideological height, and critically absorb his valuable experience in social practice and artistic creation to enrich ourselves.

Chen Baichen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association and playwright, delivered a report entitled "Learning from the Fighters of Norway's National Democratic Struggle," in which he introduced Bjørnson's life and creative activities, and analyzed Bjørnson's works and his contribution to world culture. He said: We believe that through the commemoration of Bjørnson, the friendly unity and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Norwegian people will be further strengthened.

The commemoration was jointly organized the China Peace Committee, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Chinese Dramatists Association. Bjørnson's poems were also recited at the meeting, and the Norwegian film "Such a Night" was screened.

    首都文学艺术界人士集会
    纪念比昂森逝世五十周年
    新华社26日讯　首都文学艺术界今天举行了世界文化名人挪威剧作家比昂斯腾·比昂森逝世五十周年。出席纪念会的有首都文艺界著名人士老舍、周而复、马彦祥、李伯钊等和文艺爱好者四百余人。挪威驻华使馆代表贝格尔应邀出席了纪念会。
      纪念会由中国戏剧家协会主席田汉主持，他致词说：比昂森是和易卜生同时代的挪威剧作家，对近代进步文化有过启蒙性的影响。他是挪威民族民主斗争的战士，为建立挪威民族文化和争取民族独立进行过斗争，并且反对资本主义大国侵略弱小国家，因此也是一位著名的和平战士。田汉说，比昂森的作品有它的历史局限性，让我们从新的思想高度进一步对这位北欧杰出的剧作家进行研究，批判地吸收他在社会实践和艺术创造上的宝贵经验来丰富自己。
    中国作家协会书记处书记、剧作家陈白尘在会上做了题为“向挪威民族民主斗争的战士学习”的报告，他介绍了比昂森的生平、创作活动，分析了比昂森的作品及其对世界文化的贡献。他说：我们相信，通过对比昂森的纪念，将会进一步加强中国人民和挪威人民间的友好团结和文化交流。
