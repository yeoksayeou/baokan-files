An Important Resource

    The agricultural front is now accelerating technological transformation, which requires a large amount of steel. Should we rely on foreign steel and iron produced by large enterprises to supply it? Obviously, it is impossible to meet the needs. However, local steel and iron are produced in rural areas. If county and commune industries with the necessary conditions can obtain materials locally and process them locally, they can solve part of the rural areas' need for various farm tools. This will play a significant role in promoting the development of county and commune industries and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.

    Since the composition of local steel and iron is not as stable as that of foreign steel and iron, some technical difficulties may be encountered when using it for the first time. However, facts have proven that, with effort and by understanding the rules of using it, technical problems can be solved. Moreover, the quality of local steel and iron itself is constantly improving, and experience in using local steel and iron is becoming increasingly rich. As long as we have the persistent perseverance of the people in Yancheng, Henan, who fought to pull out a foot of iron wire, we will overcome all difficulties and turn local steel and iron into an increasingly important material force in the technological transformation of agriculture.

    一项重要资源
    现在农业战线正在加速技术改造，需要大量的钢铁。依靠大企业生产的洋钢洋铁来供应吗？显然不可能满足需要。而土钢土铁产在农村，如果有条件的县社工业就地取材，就地加工，就可以解决农村对各种农具的一部分需要。这对于促进县社工业的发展，对于加速农业的技术改造，都有很大的作用。
    由于土钢土铁的成分不如洋钢洋铁稳定，开始使用时，在技术上可能要碰到一些困难。但是，事实证明，经过努力，摸熟使用它的规律，技术上的问题是可以解决的。何况土钢土铁本身的质量也在不断提高，利用土钢土铁的经验也愈来愈丰富呢？只要我们有像河南郾城那种为拔出一尺铁丝而战的坚韧不拔的毅力，就会克服一切困难。把土钢土铁变成农业技术改造中日益重要的物质力量。
