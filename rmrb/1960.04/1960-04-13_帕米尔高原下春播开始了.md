    Spring Sowing Begins Under the Pamir Plateau
		By Our Correspondent Han Wenhui
    The spring breeze from the south crosses thousands of mountains and rivers, blowing to the oases between the vast Gobi Desert and the Pamir Plateau in Xinjiang. In just a few nights, in this rural area on the northwest frontier of the motherland, the branches are full of peach and apricot blossoms, and the green wheat seedlings have grown a lot, densely covering the ground. At this time, the Yingjisha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a broadcast conference, issuing a spring sowing battle order to the people of the county: mobilize all the people, fight for ten days, and complete the spring sowing of 160,000 mu of crops.

			Careful Cultivation and Meticulous Work
    The tense spring sowing has begun. The fields are full of Uyghur men and women commune members, and government cadres are also heading to the fields with farm tools. The scene here is very different from the past. What is now reflected in the reporter's eyes is: the land is in connected plots, the ridges are in rows, and the canals are straight. In the ridges, commune members are planting corn. The person walking in front uses a row marker to draw neat squares, the commune member holding the "kantuman" (a type of hoe) digs a hole at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines, the person behind holding the manure basket throws in a handful of fertilizer, and the female commune member holding the pottery pot then sows three grains of "Golden Queen." They sow row by row according to the assembly line method. After sowing, the commune members carefully smooth the soil with wooden boards, truly achieving a land as flat as a mirror. For many years, Uyghur farmers have been accustomed to shallow cultivation and broadcasting. Today, they are using such a refined "square-hole planting" method to sow corn. This is a big change!
    Before spring sowing, the county party committee issued ten requirements for improving the quality of sowing: promote square-hole planting of corn, draw lines; apply 7,000 jin of base fertilizer; plow the land twice; level the land.... Uyghur commune members are doing everything possible to achieve these ten requirements. In the fields of Qiaobuluke Commune, the reporter met a quality inspection team composed of Maimaitise Yiti, the party branch secretary of the Tielikeqike Brigade, Se Yiti Aimaiti, the brigade leader, and an old farmer. Holding "kantumans", they inspected plot by plot from this team to that team, from this ridge to that ridge, without letting go of even a clod of soil the size of an egg.

			Enthusiastic Competition
    According to last year's experience, corn sown before Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day) yields more than 100 jin per mu than corn sown after Qingming. The Tielikeqike Brigade decided to advance the corn sowing period this year, shortening it by ten days to half a month compared to last year, and proposed a competition initiative to the Yusuying Aishan Brigade. Brigade and production team levels held mobilization meetings, and a widespread competition movement was launched between production teams, cadres, and commune members.
    The competition was most intense between the first production team and the second production team. Before spring plowing, the first team lost to the second team twice. After returning from the water conservancy construction site, Tari Pusha'er, the leader of the first team, led the team members to camp on the edge of the fields, carefully managing the wheat fields and engaging in the garden-style management of the spring sowing land, and as a result, won the red flag. On the eve of the start of spring sowing, the two teams challenged each other again, launching a close race. Tari Pusha'er divided the team's labor force into two shifts, one shift to sow near land. He led fifteen commune members, bringing pots and stoves, camping and planting in the distant land. Each person averaged 1.5 mu per day, doubling the previous year's rate. The sowing progress of the first team surpassed that of the second team from the start. Seeing that he was falling behind, Maula Asim, the leader of the second team, also rushed to plow a piece of land at night. However, they started late, and plowing could not keep up with sowing. Just as Maula Asim was anxiously spinning around in the field, Tari Pusha'er, the leader of the first team, drove up with a pair of oxen to help Maula Asim plow the land. They competed and helped each other in this way, advancing together.

					Second Time Seeking Experience
    The Tielikeqike Brigade planned to plant 1,800 mu of corn. By March 29th, 1,100 mu had been planted, and there was no problem in meeting the county party committee's requirement to complete sowing in ten days. The quality could also withstand inspection. However, the brigade leader was not sure whether they could catch up with their opponent, the Yusuying Aishan Brigade. The brigade leader, Se Yiti Aimaiti, thought: the four experiences learned from the Yusuying Aishan Brigade during spring plowing were very effective after promotion. They may have good methods this time during spring sowing, so it is better to learn some experience from them again. The old brigade leader told his ideas to the branch secretary, Maimaitise Yiti, and the branch secretary agreed. They set off that afternoon.
    The Tielikeqike Brigade and the Yusuying Aishan Brigade are more than twenty li apart. They set off on horseback as the sun was setting. After entering the Gobi Desert, unexpectedly, the four newly built reservoirs in the valley had all stored water, and the sparkling blue waves cut off the road. They had to bypass the reservoirs and walk on the beach. At this time, a special spring wind unique to the Tarim Basin suddenly struck, rolling up yellow sand, and the sky was dark and the people and horses could not open their eyes. They wandered on the beach for a long time before reaching a village in Mangshen Commune, where they spent the night. The next day, they got up before dawn and continued on their way. When they arrived at the Yusuying Aishan Brigade, they did not bother to look for the brigade leader, but went to the fields to see the land preparation and sowing quality. They looked at five production teams in a row and felt that they were lagging behind in two aspects: one was that fruit trees were not planted on the main canals, and the other was that crops were not planted on the edges of the fields. As they were watching and discussing, a commune member walked up to them and asked what they were doing. They casually replied that they were "wandering around." The commune member said seriously: We don't have any idlers here. If you have nothing to do, come and work! Although this made them a little embarrassed, they thought that they had indeed not seen an idler, which was another experience they had learned. They rushed home and convened a meeting that night to spread the three experiences they had learned from the Yusuying Aishan Brigade to the cadres and commune members.

### 帕米尔高原下春播开始了

    帕米尔高原下春播开始了	本报记者　韩文慧
    南来的春风越过千山万水，吹到新疆大戈壁和帕米尔高原间的绿洲上。几夜之间，在祖国西北边疆的这一带农村里，枝头上挂满桃花杏花，绿色的麦苗猛然长了一截，密密地盖住地面。就在这时，中共英吉沙县委召开广播大会，向全县人民发出春播战斗令：全民总动员，奋战十天，完成十六万亩作物的春播。
            精　耕　细　作
    紧张的春播展开了。田野上布满了维吾尔族男女社员，机关干部也带着农具走向田间。这里的情景和从前大不相同了，现在映在记者眼帘的是：土地连片，畦田成排，渠系笔直。在畦田里，社员们正在播种玉米。走在前面的人用划行器划出整齐的方块，拿坎土镘的社员就在纵横线的交叉点上挖个窝，后面扶着粪筐的人丢进一把肥，提着陶罐的女社员紧接着撒进三粒“金皇后”。他们按着流水作业法一窝一窝地来回播种。下完种，社员们又用木板细细地磨平。真正达到了地平如镜。多少年来习惯浅耕撒播的维吾尔族农民，今天改用这样精细的“方形窝播”法播种玉米，这是很大的变化！
    早在春播以前，县委曾经发出提高播种质量的十项要求：推行玉米方形窝播，拉线画行；底肥七千斤；地犁两遍；平整土地……。维吾尔族社员们都在千方百计地实现这十大要求。记者在乔布鲁克公社的田间，碰到了由铁力克其克大队党支部书记买买提色衣提、大队长色衣提艾买提和一个老农组成的质量检查组。他们拿着坎土镘，从这个队到那个队，从这块畦田到那块畦田，逐畦地进行检查，连一个鸡蛋大的土块也不放过。
          热　烈　的　竞　赛
    根据去年经验，清明前播种的玉米比清明后播种的每亩多收一百多斤。铁力克其克大队决定今年把玉米播种期提前，比去年缩短十天到半月，并且向玉素英艾山大队提出竞赛倡议。大队、生产队层层召开誓师会，各生产队之间、干部之间和社员之间广泛地展开了竞赛运动。
    竞赛最热烈的还数第一生产队和第二生产队。春耕前，第一队两次都没赛过第二队。一队队长塔里甫沙的尔从水利工地回来后，率领全队社员地头安营，精心管理麦田，大搞春播地的园田化，结果夺得了红旗。春播开始前夕，两队又互相提出挑战，展开了一场你追我赶的对手赛。塔里甫沙的尔把全队劳力分成两班，一班播近地；他领了十五个社员，带上锅灶，安营扎寨，播种远地。每天每人平均播一亩半，比去年提高一倍。一队播种进度一开始就超过了二队。二队队长毛拉阿细姆一看落在一队后面，晚上也赶翻了一阵地。但是，他们动手晚了，犁地跟不上播种。当毛拉阿细姆正在地里急得打转圈的时候，一队队长塔里甫沙的尔赶来一对牛，帮助毛拉阿细姆翻地。他们就是这样又赛又帮，共同前进。
                      二　次　取　经
    铁里克其克大队计划种一千八百亩玉米，到3月29日已播了一千一百亩，实现县委十天播完的要求已无问题，质量也经得起检查。但是能不能赶上他们的对手玉素英艾山大队，心里还没有底。大队长色衣提艾买提想：春耕时从玉素英艾山大队学来的四条经验，推广后见了大效。这次春播说不定他们又有什么好办法，不如再去学点经验回来。老队长把他的想法告诉了支部书记买买提色衣提，支部书记也同意，他们当天下午就动身了。
    铁里克其克大队同玉素英艾山大队相隔二十多里路。太阳快落坡时，他们骑马出发，进入戈壁之后，不料山谷里新修的四座水库都已蓄了水，粼粼碧波隔断了路，他们只好绕过水库走沙滩。这时，塔里木盆地春天特有的大风突然袭来，卷起黄沙，顿时天昏地暗，人马都睁不开眼睛。他们在沙滩上转了半天，才到了芒申公社的一个村子；在那里借宿一夜，第二天天没亮又起来赶路。到了玉素英艾山大队也顾不得找大队长，他们就下地去看整地和播种质量。他们一连看了五个生产队，觉得有两点比人家落后了，一是干渠上没有种植果木树，二是没有利用地埂点种作物。他们正在边看边议论，迎面走来一个社员，问他们是干什么的。他们随便答复说是“闲转的”。这个社员认真地说：我们这里没有一个闲人，你们没事就来劳动吧！这一下虽然弄得他们有些不好意思，但却想到了他们的确没见一个闲人，这又是学到的一条经验。他们匆匆赶回家，当天晚上就召开会议，向干部和社员传播了从玉素英艾山大队学来的这三条经验。
