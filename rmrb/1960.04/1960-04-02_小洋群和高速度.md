	Small "Foreign Groups" and High Speed

	Our newspaper today introduces six news items about small "foreign group" industrial and mining enterprises. From the development of these small "foreign group" enterprises, people can clearly see how important the development of small "foreign group" enterprises is to the high-speed development of the national economy.

	The tremendous leap forward in China's iron and steel industry over the past two years has greatly surprised people in the Western world, but they have never understood that one of the mysteries of this high speed is that we have boldly built a batch of small "foreign group" iron and steel enterprises. The huge role these small "foreign groups" have played in the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry can be powerfully illustrated by the fact that half of the 20.5 million tons of pig iron produced in China in 1959 came from small and medium-sized enterprises.

	In our ranks, there were also some people who looked down on small "foreign groups." Even now, not everyone has a sufficient understanding of the role of small "foreign groups." In fact, the law of development of all things is from small to large, from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level, from backward to advanced. There is no big without small, no complex without simple, no high-level without low-level, and no advanced without backward. New things, at the beginning, seem to be small, simple, low-level, and even seemingly backward on the surface, but they have great vitality. Only by looking at small "foreign groups" from a dialectical point of view can we draw correct conclusions.

	Small enterprises are small in scale and have simple equipment. Compared with large enterprises, this is a weakness, but from a developmental perspective, it is an advantage. Because its scale is small, it is relatively easy to set up; because its equipment is relatively simple, it is also easier to manufacture and master, and therefore easier to popularize. Vigorously running small enterprises makes it possible for our industry to bloom everywhere and strive for high speed. Therefore, the question of whether or not to have small "foreign groups" is essentially the question of whether or not to have high speed.

	Small enterprises, precisely because they are small and simple, everyone can run them. If only large enterprises are run, then only a few people can run them, and most people cannot get involved. If small enterprises are vigorously run, then the vast areas and the broad masses can get involved and have a place to use their talents. In this sense, the question of whether or not to have small "foreign groups" is also the question of whether or not to have millions of people.

	Small enterprises, precisely because they are small and simple, have lighter burdens, or even no burdens, making it easier to break superstitions, dare to think and act, and are full of revolutionary creativity. They dare to and are able to experiment with things that predecessors have not done, and dare to and are able to break certain so-called "paradigms" and "authorities." The small enterprises established since the Great Leap Forward have already had many new creations in technology. Through the creative activities of the workers of these enterprises, not only can these small enterprises improve their technical level in a very short period of time, but also create new technical experiences for us on the road of technical innovation and technical revolution.

	Small "foreign groups" are a treasure for the high-speed development of the national economy. Every special zone should run a small "foreign group" iron and steel enterprise. Places with coal and iron should definitely run them, and places without coal and iron should also cooperate to run them nearby. Not only should small "foreign group" iron and steel enterprises be run, but also small "foreign groups" in other industries should be established with small "foreign group" iron and steel enterprises as the center. This is an important guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the 1960 national economic plan, and also an important guarantee for the sustained high-speed development of China's national economy in the future.

### 小洋群和高速度

    小洋群和高速度
    本报今天介绍了六条小洋群工矿企业的消息。从这些小洋群企业发展的情况中，人们可以清楚地看到，发展小洋群企业对于国民经济的高速度发展具有多么重大的意义。
    我国的钢铁工业两年来的巨大跃进，使西方世界的人们大为惊异，可是他们始终不了解，这种高速度的奥妙之一，就是我们放手建设了一批小洋群的钢铁企业。这些小洋群，对于钢铁工业的高速度发展所起的巨大作用，可以从1959年我国生产的二千零五十万吨的生铁中一半是出自中小型企业的这一事实得到有力的说明。
    在我们的队伍中，也曾经有些人看不起小洋群。甚至直到现在，也还不是所有人都对小洋群的作用有足够的认识。其实，一切事物发展的规律，都是从小到大，从简单到复杂，从低级到高级，从落后到先进的。没有小就没有大，没有简单就没有复杂，没有低级就没有高级，没有落后就没有先进。新生的事物，在开始的时候，表面上似乎是小的、简单的、低级的甚至似乎是落后的，但是它却是有伟大的生命力。只有从辩证的观点来看小洋群，才能得出正确的结论。
    小型企业规模小，设备简陋，这同大型企业比较起来，是个弱点，但是从发展的观点看，却是个优点。因为它的规模小，比较容易办起来，因为它的设备比较简单，也比较容易制造，容易掌握，因此也就容易普及。大办小型企业，就有可能使我们的工业遍地开花，争取到高速度。因此，要不要小洋群的问题，实质上也就是要不要高速度的问题。
    小型企业正因为它是小的，简易的，因此大家都能够办。如果只办大型企业，那只能少数人办，大多数人插不上手。如果大办小型企业，那末广大地区和广大群众都可以插得上手，都可以有用武之地。在这个意义上说，要不要小洋群的问题，也就是要不要千百万群众的问题。
    小型企业正因为它是小的，简易的，包袱也就比较轻，甚至没有包袱，易于破除迷信，敢想敢干，富有革命创造性。它敢于、也便于去试验前人所没有作过的事情，敢于也便于去破除某些所谓“典范”和“权威”。大跃进以来建立的小型企业，在技术上已经有了很多新的创造。通过这些企业的职工的创造性活动，不仅可以使这些小型企业在很短的时期内提高技术水平，而且将使我们在技术革新和技术革命的道路上创造新的技术经验。
    小洋群是高速度发展国民经济的一宝。每一个专区都应该办一个小洋群的钢铁企业。有煤有铁的地方固然要办，没有煤没有铁的地方也要就近协作举办。不但要办钢铁小洋群，而且要以钢铁小洋群为中心，兴办其他行业的小洋群。这是完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划重要的保证，也是今后我国国民经济持续的高速度发展的重要保证。
