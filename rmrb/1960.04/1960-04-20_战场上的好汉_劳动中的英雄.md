Heroes on the Battlefield, Heroes in Labor
Jun Fen

In the first spring of the sixties, Beijing welcomes the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland – heroes of the militia from all walks of life. They are the heroes who "cut off the Yellow River," the heroes who conquered the plateau, the sharpshooters of the militia on the Fujian front, the "Mulan of the Sea," and the female cavalry of the borderlands... There are also Red Guards from Jinggang Mountain, "Explosion Kings" from the War of Resistance Against Japan, old and new generations of heroic tiger generals, all reporting their heroic deeds to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with unparalleled joy and excitement. They are both heroes on the battlefield and heroes on the labor front.

More than thirty years ago, when the sky was still dark, our great leader Chairman Mao led the peasants in the historically significant Autumn Harvest Uprising, creating the first revolutionary base in Jinggang Mountain. Li Guihe, an old militiaman attending the conference today, was a Red Guard at that time. He joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as a cowherd and experienced the world-famous Long March. In 1953, Li Guihe, with a strong desire to build the motherland, returned to his hometown, which he had been away from for more than twenty years. He began a new battle as an ordinary peasant and old militiaman.

The Great Leap Forward stirred the heart of the old hero. Every morning at four o'clock, he would lead two young militiamen to beat drums to urge work. "The old Red Army is drumming, hurry to work!" became a popular story among the commune members. Li Guihe was called the drummer of the Great Leap Forward. In winter, with heavy snow falling, he led the militia commando team, braving the howling north wind, breaking the ice, and jumping into the paddy fields to dig ditches. When the commune wanted to participate in railway construction, a militia commando company was established. Li Guihe served as the political instructor. During the day, he dug earth and carried stones with everyone, and at night he gave political lessons to the militia, telling stories of the Long March, and also seized the time to teach everyone shooting skills, and also stood guard and patrolled with everyone. The militiamen were deeply moved and educated by the old hero, and work efficiency increased day by day, from one cubic meter per person per day, two cubic meters, all the way to fifteen cubic meters. It became a red flag on the Xiangqian Railway construction site and was awarded the honorary title of "Red Fourth Company."

Young militia heroes took the revolutionary predecessors as their example, and they demonstrated the heroic spirit of subduing dragons and tigers on the various production and construction fronts of the motherland, launching a battle against nature. Even the towering mountains had to bow before the militia. Wuzhangyuan is located at the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains and was once the site of battles between the Wei and Shu kingdoms during the Three Kingdoms period. According to legend, Zhuge Liang stationed troops here, and in order to solve the difficulty of drinking water for the soldiers and horses, he dismounted and worshiped the water three times, but failed to bring the water up. Today, Yang Fuyuan, a Communist Party member and demobilized soldier, responded to the Party's call and led more than seventy militiamen to climb cliffs and blast holes, with explosives blasting stones all over the sky, diverting water from the Shuangpen River, which is more than fifty miles away, dredging two hundred and fourteen bends, one hundred and seven ditches, and breaking through five obstacles such as the Qinglong stone layer and the large bluestone lying across the mountainside, bringing water to Wuzhangyuan.

Our country has had Mulan and Hua Mulan in history. Today, the female militia representatives who gloriously attend the National Militia Congress have a heroic spirit that surpasses that of the female heroes of that year. Not to mention the representatives of the "Iron Sisters Company" on Jingyang Mountain who tamed the poor mountains and bad waters, even the south bank of the Yangtze River has a female hero, Yang Cuiyun, who opened mountains to divert water and subdued dragons. She is the deputy battalion commander of the female militia. Her hometown of Baiguoping has always been "mountains with little farmland, few villages and sparse population, nine years out of ten with poor harvests, and clear water as precious as oil." In the era of the Great Leap Forward, when the people wanted to realize their thousand-year dream, Yang Cuiyun took the lead and led the vast number of militiamen to participate in the project of splitting mountains to divert water. According to the decision of the Party committee, they were to divert a spring of water more than 1,000 meters above sea level to Baiguoping through seven mountains. "Geren Cliff" was a very difficult section, and it was necessary to open up a canal on this more than 100-meter-high cliff, which required aerial work. Not only women, but also some men who were used to opening mountains and splitting ridges said it was "difficult!" However, the female militiaman Yang Cuiyun was brave and strong. She tied a rope around her waist, not touching the sky above or the ground below, and drilled the first hole in the cliff. Then, she and more than thirty militia commando members erected a cloud ladder on the cliff, setting off cannons on one side and running along the cloud ladder on the other. The cliffs were conquered, and clear spring water flowed into Baiguoping along the canal.

Many militia heroes come from cities and factories. They are steel-grabbing experts and innovation pioneers on the industrial front of the motherland. The militia division of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company – this heroic army of the iron and steel industry, they "treat the workshop as a battlefield and tools as weapons." Wherever the task is the most difficult, they appear there, becoming a powerful commando force. There was a time when the daily output of steel increased sharply, but the transportation work could not keep up, and ingots piled up like mountains and could not be transported out, which was about to affect production. At this time, the Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel called on the militiamen to rush to transport steel ingots, and the headquarters of the militia division immediately transferred the backbone militiamen to form two companies to go to the "front line." After seven days of hard work, they transported all 3,374 tons of backlog steel ingots, ensuring the continuous leap forward in production.

Wen Gen is an ordinary worker in the Changchun Telephone Factory in Guangzhou who only studied for three years. Since 1959, he has achieved fourteen major creations, innovated more than twenty kinds of machines, and saved more than 37,000 work hours, which is equivalent to the workload of an ordinary worker for fifteen years. In the "good start" battle this year, he won the battle order of "realizing the automatic production line of knurling machine in five days" from the "competition arena." That night, he and the militiamen rolled up their bedding to the workshop and established a commando platoon, watching the machine while referring to reference books, designing. After five days and five nights, he drew the blueprints for the automatic production line of the knurling machine and installed the last part. This major technological innovation increased work efficiency by 35 times, completing the year's task in twelve days. Wen Gen became an engineer.

Militia heroes on all fronts of the motherland, you shoulder two tasks: one is to defend the motherland, and the other is to build the motherland. How bravely and excellently you are undertaking this sacred and glorious task!

    战场上的好汉　劳动中的英雄
    军奋
    六十年代的第一个春天，北京迎接着祖国的优秀儿女——各路民兵英雄。他们是“腰斩黄河”的好汉，征服高原的英雄，福建前线的民兵神炮手，“海上花木兰”和塞外女骑兵……还有井冈山上的红色赤卫队员，抗日战争中的“爆炸大王”，老一代和新一代的英雄虎将们，都以无比喜悦和激动的心情，向党中央毛主席汇报他们的英雄事迹。他们既是战场上的好汉，又是劳动阵线上的英雄。
    三十多年前，当天空还是黑暗的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席领导农民举行了具有历史意义的秋收起义，创造了第一个井冈山革命根据地。今天出席群英会的老民兵李桂和，就是那个时候的赤卫队员。他当时还是个放牛娃，就参加了工农红军，经历了举世闻名的二万五千里长征。1953年，李桂和怀着建设祖国的强烈愿望，回到阔别二十多年的故乡。他又以一个普通农民和老民兵的身份，开始了新的战斗。
    大跃进激荡着老英雄的心。他每天早晨四点钟，就领着两个青年民兵擂鼓催工。“老红军打鼓了，快出工！”成了社员们的美谈。李桂和被称为大跃进的擂鼓手。冬天，大雪纷飞，他率领民兵突击队，冒着呼啸的北风，破开冰层，跳下水田打氹。公社要参加修铁路，成立民兵突击连。李桂和担任政治指导员。白天，他和大家一起挖土、抬石，晚上给民兵上政治课，讲长征故事，并且抓紧休息时间教大家练习射击技术，还和大家一起站岗放哨。民兵们深受老英雄的感动和教育，工效天天上升，从每人每天一立方、二立方，一直提高到十五立方。成了湘黔铁路工地上的一面红旗，被授予“红四连”的光荣称号。
    青年民兵英雄以革命前辈为榜样，他们在祖国各个生产建设战线上，表现了降龙伏虎的豪迈气概，向大自然展开了战斗。崇山峻岭也不得不在民兵面前低下头来。五丈原在秦岭北麓，曾是三国魏蜀交兵之地。相传诸葛亮屯兵在此，为解决兵马饮水的困难，三次下马拜水，没有把水拜上来。今天，共产党员、复员军人杨富元，响应党的号召，带领七十多个民兵，攀崖走壁打炮眼，炸药爆破石满天，从五十多华里的双盆河饮水，疏通二百一十四个弯，一百零七个沟，冲破一里长的青龙石层和横卧山腰的大青石等五道难关，将水引上了五丈原。
    我国历史上有过穆桂英、花木兰，今天，光荣出席全国民兵代表会议的女民兵代表们，英雄气概赛过当年的女英雄。不说景阳山岗上治服穷山恶水的“钢铁姊妹连”的一百单八将的代表，长江南岸也来了一位开山引水镇蛟龙的巾帼英雄杨翠云。她是女民兵副营长，她的家乡白果坪，自古是“山大田地少，村少人烟稀，十年九不收，清水贵如油。”大跃进的时代，人民要实现千年理想，杨翠云便一马当先，带领广大民兵，参加了劈山引水工程。她们根据党委决定，要把拔海一千多米高的一股泉水，通过七座大山引到白果坪来。“隔人岩”是个十分艰巨的工段，要在这道一百多米的悬崖陡壁上开辟一条水渠，需要悬空作业。不仅妇女，就是一些惯于开山劈岭的男子也都说是“难！”但是女民兵杨翠云胆气壮，身体棒，腰绑绳索，上不占天，下不着地，在悬岩上打了第一个炮眼，接着，她又和三十多个民兵突击队员，在悬岩上架起云梯，一面点炮，一面沿着云梯跑。悬崖峭壁被征服了，清清的泉水顺着渠道流进了白果坪。
    许多民兵英雄从城市和工厂来，他们是祖国工业战线上的夺钢能手和革新闯将。石景山钢铁公司民兵师——这支英勇的钢铁产业军，他们“把车间当战场，工具当刀枪”，那里任务最艰巨，他们就出现在那里，成了一支强大的突击力量。有个时候，钢的日产量猛增，运输工作跟不上，钢锭堆集如山，不能运出，眼看就要影响生产。这时，石钢党委号召民兵们突击搬运钢锭，民兵师师部立即抽调基干民兵组成了两个连开赴“前线”。他们经过七天奋战，把积压的三千三百七十四吨钢锭全部运完，保证了生产的持续跃进。
    温根是广州市长春电话机厂的一个只念过三年书的普通工人，从1959年以来竟实现了十四项重大创造，革新二十多种机器，节约劳动力三万七千多个工时，相当于一个普通工人十五年的工作量。在今年“开门红”的战斗中，他从“比擂台”上拿下“五天实现滚花机自动生产流动线”的战令，当天夜晚便和民兵们一起把铺盖卷到车间，成立了突击排，一边看着机器，一边对照参考书，进行设计。经过五天五夜，画出了滚花机自动生产流动线的图纸，把最后一个零件安装好了。这项重大的技术革新，提高工效三十五倍，十二天时间完成了全年的任务。温根成了工程师。
    祖国各个战线上的民兵英雄们，你们肩负着两个任务：一个是保卫祖国，一个是建设祖国。你们是多么勇敢、多么出色地担负着这个神圣而光荣的任务啊！
