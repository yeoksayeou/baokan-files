　　Laughter Fills the Mess Hall	Jiāng zhī Shuǐ
　　We received a letter from a work team in the Lílíng People's Commune in Chángshā County. The letter said that they were rushing the early spring planting, striving for an even greater harvest this year...

　　Reading this letter drew me back to the scene of labor and training when I was sent down to their work team last year... It was as if I was once again in that heated battle to seize grain from the drought, with the roar of water pumps and the sound of hundreds of waterwheels echoing in my ears; it was as if I could once again see those people shuttling back and forth on the reservoir; it was as if I could once again hear the mountain songs of women celebrating the harvest from the deep mountain tea groves; it was as if I could once again smell the rich fragrance of the ten-mile rice fields... We had been away from that mountain village for several months, but our home – the public mess hall nestled on a small hillside, surrounded by lush bamboo forests and thickets – would never be forgotten.

　　In the morning, as soon as it was light, the hot water in the mess hall was already boiling, and the aroma of food permeated the air. People came here in twos and threes to fetch water for washing. Then, as soon as the bell rang, people led their children to the mess hall to eat. The tables in the mess hall were all set, and the careful cooks had already divided the food and placed it in hot pots for each family, so people could eat as soon as they arrived. The administrator and the cooks were always thinking about changing the variety of the food. Usually, there were two dishes for each meal, one with more oil, made more delicately; the other with less oil, but a large quantity, so people could eat their fill and have good food. I remember that on the Dragon Boat Festival last year, the Party Branch Secretary personally cooked six dishes for the commune members, holding a grand get-together to welcome the bumper harvest. Every time we had breakfast, the work team leader was always happy to take this opportunity to explain the day's tasks to everyone. People also raised their opinions on the spot and discussed how to arrange the day's production tasks properly. After the meal, the mess hall brewed several vats of hot tea for everyone to drink. After the children finished eating, their mothers took them to the nursery, and the students went to school with their schoolbags. When going to work, the male and female laborers were arranged separately. The work team leader always chose light work suitable for the women to do, and each work team had a female leader, who led the women to the fields, chatting and laughing. During work breaks, as long as the place where they were working was close to the mess hall, everyone would come back to the mess hall to rest, drink two bowls of hot tea, and smoke a few pipes of tobacco; if it was farther away, they would rest in the fields, or go to the mess halls of other work teams nearby. The other mess halls would greet them as warmly as they would greet their own people, offering cigarettes and tea, and entertaining everyone.

　　After dinner was the most lively time in the public mess hall. People all brought wooden buckets here to fetch hot water, and they were also willing to sit here to plan what work they should do tomorrow. Some of the old farmers were also willing to tell the younger generation about the bitter days of the past, or to talk about the local customs and production experiences that young people were interested in. Sometimes, people would turn up the wick of the lamp a little brighter, ask someone to play the húqin, and ask someone who liked to sing to sing a few sections of Huaguxi opera.

　　This was also a good time for commune members to engage in political and cultural studies. When there were meetings, people had just washed themselves, changed their clothes, and sat calmly under the lamp to talk freely. Some Party and Communist Youth League groups had frequent organizational lives because everyone lived relatively close together. If there were no meetings, the amateur teachers in the mess hall would take out the farmers' literacy textbooks to teach everyone to read, and the reading group leader would read the newspaper. The students who were studying at school also came back in the evening, and sometimes they joined in the fun with their parents to review their lessons. No one disturbed anyone else, and everyone studied so seriously, the atmosphere seemed so harmonious, and smiles of happiness were on people's faces.

　　The walls of the public mess hall were covered with inspiring leap-forward slogans, with a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the center. On the walls were also the commune members' mutual challenge letters, big-character posters, certificates of merit, honor rolls; and lists of members of the mess hall management committee, sanitation covenants, mess hall rules and regulations, monthly account statements, and so on. Some mess halls also had wall newspapers run by the commune members themselves, with articles, poems, and cartoons created by the commune members. Everyone wanted to dress up the mess hall like a lively little auditorium, to dress it up like a beautiful garden. An old woman in our mess hall even used the skills she learned as a girl to make many exquisite little lanterns for the mess hall. These lanterns hung all over the beams, and whenever a breeze blew, the small pieces of glass pasted on them would collide with each other, making a clinking sound.

　　The public mess hall connected people into a united and joyful collective, it became the center of the commune members' lives, and also the center of the commune members' political, cultural, and recreational activities, taking root in the hearts of the commune members. For thousands of years, farmers who had been accustomed to living in separate households and dispersed individual lives were now tasting the joy of collective labor and collective life.

　　Now, cadres who came from higher levels to inspect work lived in the public mess hall; documents, awards, and propaganda materials sent by the commune, and notices sent by the team were all sent to the public mess hall; the post office delivered newspapers and letters to the mess hall; doctors toured and provided consultations in the mess hall; the supply and marketing cooperative sold goods and purchased local products at the mess hall; even the credit cooperative handled savings, and barbers and people who repaired umbrellas and rain boots all used the public mess hall as a base to carry out their activities. The commune members also naturally came here to find them. The small doors and households that were originally scattered everywhere now leaned towards and concentrated on the public mess hall, and even built houses and built houses around the public mess hall, which gradually formed a new residential area. People had nothing to do and wanted to run to the public mess hall, treat the public mess hall as their big family, praising it as "a happy paradise", "a hall of happiness"...

　　After the habit of collective life was formed, farmers had the opportunity to engage in more political and cultural studies, their thinking broadened, their awareness continued to improve, and collectivist ideas continued to grow. New relationships of mutual assistance in production and mutual care and consideration in life were established among people. In the mess hall where we were located, as long as someone was slightly unwell, others would rush to do the heavy work for him. When eating, the cooks also made some softer and finer food for him. For those who were single, even the washing and sewing of clothes was taken care of by the collective.

　　There was also an old man who could have gone to the nursing home, but he volunteered to serve everyone in the public mess hall. He either repaired the road in front of the mess hall, or tidied up the utensils in the mess hall, and even picked up a few dead branches left over from the mountain path to use as firewood for the mess hall.

　　Not only in this mess hall, but also a brand-new relationship appeared between mess halls. In the rice transplanting season, whichever mess hall completed the task first would go all out to help others. The mobile red flag was not only planted in front of our mess hall today, but also planted in front of your mess hall tomorrow. For the honor of the collective, people happily launched challenge competitions. For many years, farmers' thinking was confined to the small world of seeking personal wealth, but now they no longer discussed these things, but were concerned about collective production, and were studying how to leap forward and how to complete the national plan. What a profound and tremendous change this is!

　　On a night before we were about to leave the public mess hall, we and the commune members sat around in the mess hall drinking tea. I don't know who started talking about the public mess hall again, and as a result, people's words went on endlessly. Someone said that a power station will be built in front of the mountain this year, and our mess hall will soon have electric lights, and we can directly listen to Beijing's news broadcasts. Others said that in another year or two, our production will be mechanized, some people are willing to be tractor drivers, and some people are willing to manage electric water pumps. Others suggested planting famous flowers and exotic plants in the public mess hall, and turning the public mess hall into a real garden, and then, people envisioned the appearance of the mess hall at that time, how big the pig farm was, how good the facilities of the nursery and school were... Finally, everyone said, "Come back and see this home in a few years, first call the public mess hall from the commune, and the mess hall will immediately send someone to pick you up in their own car. In the evening, we will invite you to watch a movie in this mess hall..." People thought a lot and were very beautiful, which made us all laugh.

　　Is this a fantasy? No! This is the coming fact! Our happy home, how much we miss you! We and all your children, like you, cheer for your growth, and sing the most enthusiastic ode for your beautiful future.

### 笑声满食堂

    笑声满食堂	江之水
    从长沙县?梨公社的一个作业组里，给我们寄来了一封信。信上说，他们在赶前春播，争取今年更大的丰收……。
    看了这封信，又把我吸引到去年下放到他们那个作业组里劳动锻炼的情景之中……。我好像又置身到那热火朝天的向干旱夺取粮食的战斗中，耳边响着抽水机的轰鸣声和千百条水车车水的声音；我好像又看见了那些在水库上穿梭奔驰的人们；我好像又听到从深山茶林中传来妇女们欢呼丰收的山歌声；我好像又闻到了十里稻田的浓香……。我们离开那个山村已经几个月了，但是，我们的那个家——座落在小山坡上，被青翠的竹林和灌木丛包围了的公共食堂，是永远也不会忘记的。
    早晨，天刚亮，食堂里的热水已经烧得滚烫，饭菜的香味也四溢了。人们三三两两地到这里来打水漱洗。接着，钟声一响，人们就陆续地领着孩子们来到食堂吃饭。食堂的桌位都是排好了的，细心的炊事员已经把饭菜一家家地分好放在热锅里，人们随来随吃。事务长和炊事员们总想着变换饭菜的花样，平时每餐饭都是两个菜，一个菜油放得多一些，做得精细一些；另一个菜放的油较少些菜量很多，真是吃得又饱又好。记得去年过端阳节那一天，党支部书记亲自下厨给社员们做了六个菜，来了一次迎丰收的大联欢。每逢吃早饭的时候，作业组长总是乐意利用这个机会，把这一天的任务跟大家交代一番。人们也当场提出意见，共同商量着把当天生产任务安排停当。饭后，食堂又泡上了几缸热茶，供大家饮用。孩子们吃完饭，就由妈妈送到托儿所去，学生们背着书包上学校了。出工时，男女劳动力都是各有安排的，作业组长总是选适合妇女们干的轻活让她们做，而且每个作业组里都有一个妇女队长，就由她带领着妇女们有说有笑地下田了。劳动休息的时候，只要干活的地方离食堂近，大家就回来在食堂里休息，喝上两碗热茶，抽上几袋烟；如果离得较远，就在田头歇息，或者大家一块儿到较近的别的作业组的食堂里去坐坐。别的食堂会像招待自己食堂里的人一样热情地送烟送茶，招待大家。
    晚饭后，该是公共食堂最热闹的时候了。人们都提着木桶到这里来打热水，也都愿意坐在这里计划计划明天该做些什么活计。有的老农们还愿意在这里给后生子们讲讲过往的苦日子，或者是说说年青人感兴趣的本乡本土的风俗人情和生产经验。有的时候，人们又把灯芯再捻亮一些，请人拉起胡琴，由爱唱的人给唱上两段花鼓戏。
    这时候也是社员们进行政治、文化学习的好时机。逢到开会的时候，人们刚好洗过了身子，换上了衣裳安详地坐在灯下畅谈。有党、团小组的，由于大家住的比较集中，组织生活也过得很经常。若是不开会，就由本食堂的业余教师拿出农民识字课本来教大家识字，听读报小组长读报。在学校读书的学生们晚上也都回来了，有时他们也和爸爸妈妈们凑热闹地在一起复习功课。人们谁也不打扰谁，每个人都那么认真地学习，气氛显得那么和谐，人们的脸上流露出幸福的笑容。
    公共食堂的墙壁上贴满了鼓舞人心的跃进口号，正中挂一幅毛主席像。墙壁上还有社员们互相挑战竞赛的决心书、大字报、奖状、光荣榜；还有食堂管理委员会委员的名单、卫生公约、食堂规章制度、每月一结的账目清单等等。有的食堂还有社员自己办的墙报，上面有社员创作的文章、诗歌、漫画。人们都想把食堂打扮得像一个热闹的小礼堂，把它打扮得像一座美丽的花园。我们食堂的一位老妈妈还用作姑娘时学会的手艺，给食堂扎糊了许多精致的小灯笼。这些灯笼挂满了房梁，只要微风一吹，它上面糊制的小玻璃片就互相撞击，发出叮铃的响声。
    公共食堂把人们联系在一个团结、欢乐的集体之中，它成了社员生活的中心，也是社员政治、文化娱乐的活动中心了，在社员心中扎下了根子。千百年来过惯了独门独户，分散的个体生活的农民，现在是尝到了集体劳动、集体生活的乐趣了。
    现在，上级来了检查工作的干部，住在公共食堂里；公社发来的文件、奖状、宣传材料，队里发来的通知都送到公共食堂；邮局送报送信到食堂；医生巡回在食堂里应诊；供销社卖货、收购土产的也到食堂，甚至信用部办储蓄的，理发的，修理雨伞、雨鞋的也都以公共食堂为基点展开活动。社员们也都自然而然地到这里来找他们。原来分散四处的小门小户，现在都向公共食堂靠拢集中，甚至围着公共食堂建屋造房，这就逐渐形成一个新的居民点。人们没有事也要往公共食堂里跑，把公共食堂当作自己的大家庭，称赞它为“幸福的乐园”、“幸福堂”……。
    集体生活习惯养成以后，农民们有机会进行更多的政治文化学习，他们的思想开阔了，觉悟不断提高，集体主义思想不断成长。人们之间建立了生产上互相帮助，生活上彼此关心体贴的新关系。在我们所在的那个食堂里，只要有人身体稍有不适，旁人就抢着替他干重活。吃饭时，炊事员们也特意给他做些软细一点的。对于那些单身人来说，连洗衣缝衣的事也由集体给包下来了。
    还有一个本来可以进敬老院的老人，他却自愿在公共食堂里为大家服务。他不是修修食堂门前的路，就是整整食堂里的用具，连山中小路上残留下来的几根枯树枝，他也拣来给食堂作柴烧。
    不仅在本食堂里，食堂与食堂之间也出现了一种崭新的关系。在插秧的季节，哪个食堂先完成了任务，都是全力以赴地帮助别人。流动红旗不是今天插在我们食堂的门前，就是明天又插到你们食堂的门前。为了集体的荣誉，人们兴高彩烈地展开挑战竞赛。多少年来，农民的思想被束缚在寻求个人发家致富的小天地里，如今他们却不再议论这些，而是关心集体的生产，是研究如何跃进，如何完成国家计划的问题了。这是一个多么深刻、巨大的转变！
    在我们即将离开公共食堂以前的一个夜晚，我们和社员们围坐在食堂里喝茶。不知是谁又开头扯起了公共食堂来，结果人们的话就说个没完了。有人说，山前今年将要建立发电站，咱们这食堂快要有电灯了，也可以直接收听北京的新闻广播了。还有人说，再过一两年，咱们的生产都要实现机械化，有人愿意作拖拉机手，有的人愿意管理电动抽水机。还有人建议在公共食堂广植名花异草，把公共食堂修成一座真正的花园，然后，人们又设想那时候食堂的样子，养猪场有多大，托儿所和学校的设备有多好……。最后，大家说“过几年你们再回来看看这个家，先从公社给公共食堂挂个电话，食堂马上就派人开着自己的汽车去接你们。到了晚上，就在本食堂里招待你们看电影……”人们想得很多很美，说得我们都笑了。
    难道这是幻想吗？不！这是即将到来的事实！我们的幸福的家啊，我们多么怀念你！我们和你的所有的儿女们一样，为你的壮大欢呼，为你美好的未来，唱一支最热情的赞歌。
