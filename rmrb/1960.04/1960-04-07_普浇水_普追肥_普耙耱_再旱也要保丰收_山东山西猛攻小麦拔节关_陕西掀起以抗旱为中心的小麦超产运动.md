Xinhua News Agency Report: Shandong Province's more than seven million strong labor force, after achieving victory in the major battle of the wheat greening stage, is now vigorously attacking the jointing stage. As of now, the province has irrigated over 16 million mu of wheat at the jointing stage, topdressed over 14 million mu, and loosened soil to preserve moisture on over 18 million mu. More than 10 million mu of wheat fields have also undergone prevention and treatment for rust and pests.

This year, the wheat is growing very well in various parts of Shandong. According to analyses from various regions, first-class seedlings account for 50% to 60%, second-class seedlings account for about 40%, and third-class seedlings account for only 5% to 10%. To promote even better wheat growth, all regions have launched a wheat field management campaign centered on skillfully irrigating at the jointing stage and skillfully applying topdressing, while also preventing frost, pests, and lodging, based on the current wheat growth and climate changes. Zibo Prefecture proposed a 15-day campaign to complete irrigation and topdressing by April 5th. Heze Prefecture has prepared more than 30 billion jin of native miscellaneous fertilizer and a large amount of ammonium sulfate. Guan County in Liaocheng Prefecture has already transported 2.6 million jin of chemical fertilizer to production teams in various communes. For wheat fields on ridges, highlands, and remote areas, various places have adopted methods such as diverting water uphill, building channels around mountains, relay water lifting, attacking from both ends, digging water diversion ditches, and sinking earth wells, vigorously promoting waterwheel clusters, windlass clusters, dipper clusters, and machinery clusters for irrigation.

All regions have universally made preparations for preventing frost, truly achieving comprehensive prevention and treatment upon command. In Jining Prefecture, counties, communes, and teams have established frost prevention organizations from top to bottom, improved meteorological sentry posts and service networks, designated areas for responsibility, and fixed tasks to teams and groups. Liaocheng Prefecture also held an artificial fog experiment meeting, testing more than 30 kinds of smoke and fog agents.

Xinhua News Agency Report: After universally irrigating, universally topdressing, and universally harrowing during the wheat greening period, people's communes in various parts of Shanxi immediately launched a high tide of wheat field management to vigorously attack the wheat jointing stage in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest. Currently, more than 1.2 million commune members have been投入麦田management, and in the past ten days or so, over one million mu of wheat fields in the province have been irrigated at the jointing stage, 6.9 million mu have been fertilized, and 4.33 million mu have been cultivated and weeded. To prevent frost, various regions have universally dug frost prevention pits centered on high-yield fields, prepared firewood, and organized specialized teams, ready to light fires for prevention as soon as frost arrives.

Under the circumstances of continued drought in Shanxi, all regions generally adhere to the principle of "water and fertilizer as the commander" in wheat field management, irrigating and topdressing heavily to vigorously combat the drought. To balance wheat growth and strive for a comprehensive harvest, eight counties in the famous wheat-producing areas of Linyi, Yuncheng, Yixian, and Ruicheng proposed the slogan of "first-class seedlings should not lodge, third-class seedlings should catch up to first-class." Based on past management experience, they have applied 31.5 million jin of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as phosphate fertilizer, plant ash, and kang soil to 630,000 mu of first-class wheat fields with the risk of lodging, and delayed irrigation of jointing water by five to ten days for wheat with excessive growth to prevent lodging. They have applied 96 million jin of fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and human manure to 320,000 mu of third-class wheat seedlings, with an average application of 10 jin of chemical fertilizer and 3,000 jin of human manure per mu. For general wheat seedlings, they adopted a method of combining nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers and attacking with both water and fertilizer.

To make management measures more suitable for wheat growth needs, all regions have paid attention to scientific analysis and summarizing and promoting wheat field management experience, making the work more and more meticulous. Under the auspices of the Pinglu County Science and Technology Association, old farmers and technicians held extensive seminars, formulating demonstration regulations for the county's wheat jointing stage based on past experience and this year's wheat growth characteristics, achieving the goal of attacking the jointing stage by observing the weather, the land, and the seedlings.

This newspaper reports that farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province warmly responded to the call of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for "large-scale super-production in irrigated areas and guaranteeing a bumper harvest in drylands," launching a wheat super-production movement centered on drought resistance.

To overcome drought, all parts of the province mobilized 5 million people under the slogan of "declaring war on heaven and guaranteeing a bumper harvest without rain," launching a vigorous anti-drought struggle. Now, 87% of the province's wheat has been irrigated with greening water, with the irrigated area increasing more than tenfold compared to the same period last year. In addition, 85.3% of the wheat fields have been harrowed to conserve moisture, 83.4% have been spring-cultivated, and the vast majority of wheat fields have been fertilized during the greening period, basically overcoming the drought. According to typical surveys by the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, first-class wheat fields accounted for 45.8% in the Weibei dry plateau, and second-class wheat fields accounted for 40.2%, with an average of 150,000 to 166,000 seedlings per mu, and individual tillers also having three to five or more. Wheat in the irrigated areas on both sides of the Wei River is growing even better, generally having 600,000 to 900,000 tillers per mu, with individual tillers having four to six.

After achieving initial victories in the anti-drought struggle, various regions advanced victoriously and launched a super-production competition. According to statistics from Yan'an Prefecture and eight cities and counties in Guanzhong, including Sanyuan, Weinan, Dali, and Pucheng, more than 6 million mu of super-production fields have been established (accounting for more than half of the total wheat field area in these counties), and the increased production targets for these super-production fields are on average 10% to 15% higher than the original plans. Driven by the super-production movement, some areas with poor water conservancy facilities have begun to vigorously build water conservancy projects to further improve irrigation conditions. Dali County, a dryland area in the high plateau with severe drought, sank more than 1,000 wells in eight days, increasing the daily progress of irrigated wheat fields from the original 40,000 mu to more than 80,000 mu. Weinan County, which has better water conservancy conditions, also organized more than 2,000 super-production professional teams with 300,000 people participating, applying fertilizer and irrigating water one more time to 900,000 mu of super-production fields throughout the county. In order to change the appearance of third-class wheat seedlings in Lintong County, the seven secretaries and county heads of the county party committee led a large number of county and commune cadres to go deep into the production teams to focus on third-class wheat fields. At present, more than 100,000 mu of third-class wheat in the county has generally received one application of topdressing fertilizer, and 80% has received one irrigation, reducing the proportion of third-class wheat from 16.8% of the total wheat field area to 6%.

    普浇水　普追肥　普耙耱　再旱也要保丰收
    山东山西猛攻小麦拔节关
    陕西掀起以抗旱为中心的小麦超产运动
    据新华社讯　山东省七百多万劳动大军，在取得大战小麦返青关的胜利以后，又猛攻拔节关。截至目前，全省已浇拔节水一千六百多万亩，追拔节肥一千四百多万亩，松土保墒一千八百多万亩，经过防治锈病和虫害的麦田也已经有一千多万亩。
    今年，山东各地的小麦长势很好。据各地分析，一类苗占50％至60％，二类苗占40％左右，三类苗仅占5％至10％。为了促使小麦生长得更好，各地都根据当前小麦的生长情况和气候变化等情况，掀起了一个以巧浇拔节水，巧追拔节肥为中心的防霜冻、防病虫、防倒伏的麦田管理运动。淄博专区提出大干十五天，4月5日前浇完拔节水，追完拔节肥；菏泽专区已准备了三百多亿斤土杂肥和大量硫酸铵；聊城专区冠县的二百六十万斤洋化肥也已经运送到各个公社的生产队。各地对岭地、高岗地麦田和远地麦田，都采取引水上山，修环山渠道和接力提水，两头夹击、挖引水沟、打土井，大搞水车群、辘轳群、斗子群、机械群等办法进行浇灌。
    各地普遍进行了预防霜冻的准备工作，真正做到一声号令，全面防治。济宁专区各县由县到社到队，自上而下的建立了防霜冻组织，健全了气象哨、服务网，划片包干，把任务固定到队、组。聊城专区还召开了人造雾试验会，试验熏烟雾剂三十多种。
    据新华社讯　山西各地人民公社为争取小麦大丰收，在小麦返青期实现普浇水、普追肥、普耙耱之后，紧接着又掀起了一个猛攻小麦拔节关的麦田管理高潮。目前，各地投入麦田管理的社员已达一百二十多万人，在最近十多天中，全省麦田，已经浇过拔节水的有一百多万亩，施过拔节肥的六百九十多万亩，并有四百三十三万亩麦田进行了中耕、锄草。为了预防霜冻，各地普遍以丰产方为中心，挖了防霜坑，准备了柴草，组织了专门队伍，准备霜冻一来就点火预防。
    山西在旱象继续发展的情况下，各地在麦田管理中一般都本着“水肥为帅”的原则，大浇、大追，力战旱魔。为使麦苗平衡生长，争得全面丰收，著名的产麦区临猗、运城、禝山、芮城等八个县，提出了“一类苗不倒伏，三类苗赶一类”的口号，根据往年的管理经验，已给有倒伏危险的六十三万亩一类麦田追施磷肥、草木灰、炕土等磷钾肥料三千一百五十万斤，对有狂长现象的小麦推迟浇拔节水五至十天，防止倒伏；给三十二万亩三类麦苗追施硫铵、人粪尿等速效氮肥九千六百万斤，每亩平均施化肥十斤，人粪尿三千斤。对一般麦苗则采取了氮磷肥并举水肥齐攻的办法。
    为了使管理措施更加适合小麦生长的需要，各地都注意了科学分析和总结推广麦田管理经验，使工作越作越细致。平陆县由县科学技术协会主持，广泛举行老农、技术员座谈会，根据历年经验和今年小麦生长特点，制定了全县小麦拔节关示范规程，做到了看天、看地、看苗攻拔节关。
    本报讯　陕西省各地农民热烈响应中共陕西省委“灌区大超产，旱地保丰收”的号召，掀起了一个以抗旱为中心的小麦超产运动。
    为了战胜干旱，全省各地在“向天宣战，无雨保丰收”的口号下，出动了五百万人，展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱斗争。现在，全省87％的小麦都已灌过返青水，灌溉面积比去年同期增加十倍以上。另外，85.3％的麦田都进行了耙耱保墒，83.4％的麦田进行了春锄，同时绝大部分麦田都施了返青肥，基本上战胜了干旱。据中国农业科学院陕西分院的典型调查，渭北旱原的一类麦田占到了45.8％，二类麦田占40.2％，平均每亩有苗十五万到十六万六千多株，单株分蘖也有三个到五个以上。渭河两岸灌溉区的小麦生长更好，一般每亩分蘖为六十至九十万个，单株分蘖四至六个。
    各地在取得了抗旱斗争的初步胜利以后，又乘胜前进，掀起了超产竞赛运动。据延安专区和关中的三原、渭南、大荔、蒲城等八个市县的统计，已经建立了六百多万亩超产田（占这些县全部麦田面积的一半以上），这些超产田的增产指标，平均每亩比原订计划多产10％到15％。在超产运动的推动下，一些水利设施较差的地区，又开始大兴水利，以进一步改善灌溉条件。干旱较重的高塬旱地的大荔县在八天内就打井一千多眼，使灌溉麦田的日进度由原来的四万亩增加到八万多亩。水利条件较好的渭南县，也组织了二千多个有三十万人参加的超产专业队，给全县九十万亩超产田多施了一次肥和多灌了一次水。临潼县为了改变三类麦苗的面貌，县委的七个书记和县长，带领了大批县、社干部，深入到生产队大抓三类麦田。目前，全县十万多亩三类麦普遍偏施了一次追肥，80％的偏灌了一次水，使占麦田总面积的16.8％的三类麦下降到6％。
