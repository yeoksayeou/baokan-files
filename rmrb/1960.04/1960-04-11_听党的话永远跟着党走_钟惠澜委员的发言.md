Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's draft revision of the National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC.

In 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, our heroic and intelligent people further changed the face of society, transformed nature, and overcame the extraordinary severe natural disasters that had not been seen for decades, thus achieving a high-speed, proportionate, and continuous Great Leap Forward on the entire front of national economic construction, and completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This enables our country to greatly exceed the original expectations for the level of national economic development during the Second Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, it makes it possible for our country to strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in ten years or less, and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule. Such brilliant achievements and such magnificent prospects are so exciting! How lucky and glorious it is to be born in the Mao Zedong era! When drinking water, remember the source, sincerely thank the Party, and sincerely thank Chairman Mao.

Regarding the current guidelines and tasks for medical health, Vice Premier Li Fuchun has given clear instructions: "In terms of health undertakings, continue to vigorously carry out the mass health movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate major diseases, and promote the experience of Jishan County in Shanxi Province and Foshan City in Guangdong Province in the health movement. We should fully mobilize the masses, make great fanfare, and publicize widely, so that everyone knows it and everyone acts, and make the health movement combine with the Great Leap Forward in production and the cultural and technological revolution. We must strengthen rural medical and preventive work with the county hospital as the center and actively support agricultural production..." "Continue to vigorously carry out mass sports activities in urban and rural areas, and promote exercise, playing ball, running, mountain climbing, swimming, shooting, shadowboxing and various sports activities, and improve the level of sports on the basis of popularization."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian also gave clear instructions: "While supporting the high-speed development of production and construction, actively support the high-speed development of cultural, educational, health, and scientific undertakings. The sustained leap forward in socialist economic construction urgently requires more technical talents who are both red and expert, and requires the rapid development of culture, education, health care, and science and technology." Chairman Mao said: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Vice Premier Li Xiannian instructed: "In 1960, a greater high tide of cultural construction will be launched throughout the country, and a wider movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, change customs and habits, and transform the world will be carried out."

Comrades, from the above instructions of the Central Committee, it can be clearly seen how broad the scope of health work is, and how glorious and arduous the tasks of our medical and health workers are. A few days ago, Minister Li Dequan and Vice Minister Xu Yunbei of the Ministry of Health also gave us very clear and specific important instructions and asked us to make everyone realize "Hygiene is glorious, unhygienic is shameful" within one year. Comrades, like everyone else, I was very excited after listening to the instructions of the central leaders. We must seize the current favorable situation, exert all our energy, strive for the top, and devote ourselves to the ongoing and vigorously developing national, historical and significant health movement that eliminates harm and disease, focuses on hygiene, improves labor production, improves people's physical fitness and health, and transforms the world. At the same time, we must do everything possible to work hard, practically, and cleverly, and make more creative achievements in a faster, better, and more economical way to welcome the upcoming high tide of cultural and technological revolution and serve the socialist production and construction of the motherland. We must more often go out of the gates of hospitals and schools, go to the neighborhoods, go to the factories, go to the rural communes, and become one with the workers and peasants, and combine with the local people's lives (such as canteens, nurseries, medical and health networks), production labor, and learning to carry out medical prevention, health propaganda, and cadre training, etc., in order to set off a high tide of national health, so that the whole people will be proud to be members of the glorious and hygienic health team of the Mao Zedong era, who are strong and healthy and pay attention to hygiene. We want to make our country the cleanest and most hygienic country in the world. In addition, we must also more conscientiously implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. In our medical research work, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine must unite and cooperate more closely, and the old and the young must be better combined. We must more systematically and deeply inherit and carry forward the medicine of our motherland, so that our country's medicine becomes the newest and most complete medical theoretical system in the world. Comrades, our tasks are numerous and arduous, but the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will always guide us to advance bravely. As long as we listen to the Party and follow the Party, we will be invincible and victorious. Holding high Chairman Mao's banner of victory, we are full of confidence that we will surely successfully complete the glorious historical tasks assigned to us by the Party.

In terms of subjective desires, every medical worker has the determination or at least wants to do the job well, complete the task, or overfulfill it. But what the outcome will be, to a large extent, depends on each person's position, viewpoint, and way of thinking. Without worldview and methodology, it is difficult to imagine that the work (such as research work) can be done well, because if the methodology is wrong, the research results will inevitably be wrong, otherwise it will inevitably be slow, poor, and costly. We intellectuals from the old society, especially myself, due to historical conditions, must intensify our efforts to study politics, study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and also go to the workers and peasants to participate in labor training and become one with the masses, establish feelings for the workers and peasants, in order to accelerate self-transformation. Transform our old worldview and establish the proletarian worldview, so that we can be transformed into health workers of the working class who are both red and expert. Now please allow me to quote Chairman Mao's works as valuable documents for myself and everyone to study together and transform ourselves. Chairman Mao said: "If intellectuals do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The final boundary between revolutionary or non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants. Their final boundary lies only in this point, and does not depend on what they say about the Three People's Principles or Marxism. True revolutionaries must be willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants." The above passage of Chairman Mao is the best touchstone to test and identify whether every intellectual truly accepts transformation and truly agrees with and supports the revolution.

After repeatedly studying this passage of Chairman Mao, I have gained a very profound education and inspiration, which made me realize that in the past decades of work, due to the old viewpoints and ways of thinking prevailing, I only took the wrong bourgeois so-called expert route that was high above. I could not see the great truth and role of the mass line. What is particularly serious is that after liberation, I still took this wrong white and expert road, neglecting the importance of the mass line working method, which on the one hand made me emphasize personal interests in my work, often detached from the masses, and failed to give play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and failed to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, thus causing losses in work. In research work, because I neglected the mass line, it promoted the development of very stinky individualism, which made my mind hot. I forgot my roots and did not think about the source as soon as I made insignificant small achievements in my work. Not only did I not attribute it to the Party, but I also studied politics more humbly and studied Chairman Mao's works in order to better serve the people, but I was proud and arrogant. Fortunately, the Party sounded the alarm in time during the rectification and anti-rightist period, patiently educated me, and saved me. Otherwise, if it developed, I would inevitably fall into the rightist quagmire. Therefore, I will always thank the Party for the education and transformation opportunities it has given me. I will definitely further transform myself and do my job well to repay the Party for its care and expectations for me. After studying Chairman Mao's works and other relevant documents, combined with visiting the brilliant achievements of the socialist construction of the motherland since the Great Leap Forward, I deeply realized that the wisdom and strength of the masses are endless. In any work, one should appear in the collective as an ordinary worker, and should not be above the collective. I must firmly remember that the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. Chairman Mao once said: The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often ridiculously naive. I must also firmly remember that the question of attitude towards the mass movement has always been one of the fundamental issues of contention between Marxists and anti-Marxists. In socialist construction, this is also a fundamental issue. Marxists have always been sensitive to new things and have always adopted a firm attitude of cherishing them without fear of their shortcomings.

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and the wise leadership of the Party, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the medical and health units in Beijing have conscientiously implemented the Party's health work guidelines and policies, adhered to putting politics in command, followed the mass line, broken superstitions, emancipated the mind, and vigorously carried out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and have achieved great victories on all health fronts. Whether in the patriotic health movement to eliminate the four pests and eliminate diseases, clinical medicine, prevention, teaching, research, cadre training, medicines, equipment, and health work in factories, schools, cities, and villages, etc., there have been great achievements in an all-round leap forward, which has played a great role in protecting the health of the people in the capital and in the continuous Great Leap Forward of the great socialist construction of the capital. I work in the Beijing People's Hospital and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital affiliated to Beijing Medical College. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and the correct leadership of the hospital Party committee, we adhere to putting politics in command and conscientiously implement the Party's health education policy. Whether in political thought, clinical medicine, teaching, scientific research, technical innovation, cadre training, and urban and rural health work centered on the hospital, etc., we have broken the theory of conditions and achieved certain results. Due to time constraints, I will not report in detail here. Due to space limitations, I will not make a comprehensive introduction here.

Now, I would like to report to the conference on the situation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital in learning from the advanced experience of Soviet medicine since the Great Leap Forward:

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and under the leadership of the municipal Party committee and the hospital Party committee, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital has achieved remarkable results in various tasks such as learning and disseminating the advanced experience of Soviet medicine, clinical scientific research, and cadre training.

In terms of disseminating the advanced experience of Soviet medicine, all medical personnel in the hospital have been studying advanced Soviet medicine for two years, among whom there are 145 activists. In clinical application, there are 221 new Soviet treatment methods, 1,526 translated Soviet documents, and 17 translated Soviet professional works (about 1.8 million words, 6 of which have been published). According to incomplete statistics, 368 translated papers have been published (including abstracts). Through these activities, not only has it contributed to the medical community throughout the country, but the hospital, based on the cultivation of former Soviet experts and under the guidance and help of newly hired Soviet experts and the efforts of young medical personnel, has greatly improved the quality and level of medical care. The treatment of many diseases in the hospital has caught up with or exceeded the level of this country or capitalist countries. For example, the application of the advanced Soviet Novocaine therapy to treat 80 cases of gastric ulcer that had not healed for many years had an effective rate of 97.5%. Another example is that the mortality rate of cerebral hemorrhage diseases has been reduced to 35% from the mortality rate of 31 cases from September 1959 to February 1960 (59 cases from 1958 to August 1959, mortality rate 52.5%), which is much lower than the lowest domestic report (34 cases in three months at the end of 1958) of 52% mortality rate. The newly established neurosurgery department performed 54 brain tumor operations in one year, with a mortality rate of only 7.4%, which is lower than the domestic and American and Japanese literature data found. In terms of rescuing pneumonia in pediatrics, the mortality rate decreased from 10.05% in 378 cases in 1958 to 0.31% in 327 cases in 1959, which has exceeded the domestic and foreign levels. In terms of rescuing toxic dysentery, the pediatrics department successfully reduced the mortality rate from 29.2% in 1958 to 5.2% in 1959 using artificial hibernation comprehensive therapy, which was 29.2% lower than Shanghai's 31.1% in 1958. The surgical treatment rate of spleen and stomach in surgery is higher than the level in China and the United States. For example, the mortality rate of splenorenal shunt is 3%, which is lower than the domestic 4.8% in the same period, and even lower than the 14% in the United States.

In terms of combining clinical practice with scientific research: In the past two years, a total of 179 research projects and clinical practice summaries have been completed, including 45 in nursing, and a total of 136 related articles have been published. Two issues of the thesis collection and newsletters have been published, and two volumes of specialized experience collections have been compiled. Among them, 47 items have exceeded the level of capitalist countries.

In terms of cadre training, in addition to the significant improvement of cadres in our hospital through scientific research, study and clinical practice, a total of 144 visiting physicians (including short-term visiting physicians) have been trained in two years, 49 in 1958 and 95 in 1959, which is a large increase compared with 54 in 1957. In addition, our hospital has established an amateur advanced nursing refresher class and an amateur nursing school (with a total of 85 participants), which has greatly improved the quality of nursing.

The workload of medical work has made significant leaps forward in the past two years: 179,610 outpatient (emergency) visits in 1957, 380 beds. Outpatient (emergency) visits increased to 322,071 in 1958, an increase of 80% compared with 1957. There were 490 beds in 1958, an increase of 28.9% compared with 1957. There were 391,910 outpatient (emergency) visits in 1959, an increase of 21% compared with 1958, and 521 beds, an increase of 6.3% compared with 1958. In terms of rural prevention and treatment work, medical personnel in our hospital are often on duty in rotation to assist the Zhoukoudian Hospital, Liangxiang Hospital, and Liangxiang Repair Factory Hospital in the suburbs to solve problems such as diagnosis and treatment and cadre training.

Recently, under the leadership of the hospital Party committee, a high tide of technical innovation has been set off in the hospital, and more than 70,000 suggestions have been put forward within three days. Medical personnel used three plastic tubes and small balloons to make a good three-cavity tube to replace imported products. Surgery created a way to shorten the rewarming time of patients after hypothermia anesthesia and reduce the patient's pain. Medical personnel and workers have worked hard and cleverly to successfully complete the self-made cutting-edge medical device artificial kidney. Now the technical innovation movement in the hospital is developing in depth.

The above-mentioned achievements of our hospital since the Great Leap Forward have been achieved under the leadership of the hospital Party committee, putting politics in command, conscientiously implementing the Party's health work guidelines and policies, and conscientiously implementing the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the large-scale mass movement. It is another profound education and enlightenment for me. In order to better serve the people of the motherland, I am determined to work hard to study politics and Chairman Mao's works and thoroughly transform myself. Listen to the Party, be a docile tool of the Party, and always follow the Party.

Comrades, the Mao Zedong era is a great era where one day equals twenty years, an era where the world is turned upside down, mountains and rivers change their appearance, and imperialism trembles. But the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, US imperialism, is still occupying our motherland's sacred territory of Taiwan. I guarantee to resolutely support the three magic weapons together with everyone, unite closely around the Party, strive for the top, exert even greater energy, contribute all our strength, do a good job in health work, and strive to build the socialist cause of the motherland, to crush the conspiracy of US imperialism, to liberate Taiwan, and to defend the motherland and world peace.

Finally, let us cheer: Long live the great Chairman Mao! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country! Long live the great motherland! Long live the great and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship! Long live world peace!

### 听党的话永远跟着党走  钟惠澜委员的发言

专栏：

    听党的话永远跟着党走
    钟惠澜委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和谭震林副总理关于1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要修正草案并完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会常委会的工作报告。
    1959年在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下，英勇智慧的我国人民进一步改变了社会面貌，改造了自然，战胜了数十年不遇的特大天灾，从而在整个国民经济建设的战线上取得了高速度的按比例的继续大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划主要指标，这样使我国能够在第二个五年计划期间的国民经济发展水平大大超过原来所设想的，同时使我国可能在争取在十年或更少时间在工业主要产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，并且提前实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要。这样的辉煌成就，这样的壮丽前景，多么令人兴奋！生逢毛泽东时代多么幸运！多么光荣！饮水思源，衷心感谢党，衷心感谢毛主席。
    关于当前医学卫生的方针任务，李富春副总理曾做明确指示：“在卫生事业方面，继续大力开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的群众卫生运动，推广山西省稷山县和广东省佛山市的卫生运动的经验。应当充分发动群众，大张旗鼓，大作宣传，使家喻户晓，人人动作起来，并且使卫生运动与生产大跃进和文化、技术革命互相结合。要以县医院为中心加强农村医疗预防工作，积极支援农业生产。……”“继续大力开展城乡的群众性的体育运动，要提倡作操、打球、赛跑、爬山、游水、射击、打拳及各色各样的体育活动，并且在普及的基础上，提高运动水平。”
    李先念副总理也曾做明确指示：“在支持高速度发展生产建设的同时，积极支持文教卫生和科学事业的高速度发展。社会主义经济建设的持续跃进，迫切要求更多的又红又专的技术人才，要求文化教育、卫生保健和科学技术的迅速发展。”毛主席说过：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”李先念副总理指示：“一六九○年在全国范围内，将掀起一个更大的文化建设高潮，将更加广泛地开展除四害、讲卫生、移风易俗、改造世界的运动。”
    同志们，从以上中央的指示可以很清楚地看出卫生工作的范围是多么广阔，我们医务卫生工作者的任务又多么光荣艰巨。前几天中央卫生部李德全部长及徐运北副部长也对我们做了很明确具体的重要指示并要求我们于一年内要做到人人认识“卫生是光荣，不卫生是耻辱”。同志们，我同大家一样，听了中央首长的指示以后，非常兴奋，我们一定要抓紧目前大好形势，鼓足干劲，力争上游，早日投入到正在轰轰烈烈发展着的以除害灭病讲卫生提高劳动生产，提高人民体质和健康水平改造世界的全民性的有历史意义的卫生运动中去。同时，我们也一定要千方百计地苦干、实干、巧干，多快好省地做出更多的富有创造性的成绩，来迎接正在到来的文化技术革命高潮，为祖国社会主义生产建设服务。我们一定要更经常地走出医院及学校的大门，到地段里去，到工厂里去，到农村公社里去，与工人农民群众打成一片，结合当地群众的生活（如食堂、托儿所、医疗卫生网）、生产劳动和学习等，进行医疗预防、卫生宣传和培养干部等工作，以便掀起一个全民办卫生的高潮，使全民都以属于毛泽东时代的身强体壮的讲卫生的光荣卫生队伍的成员而自豪。我们要使我国成为世界上最清洁，最卫生的国家。此外，我们也一定要更认真地贯彻党的中医政策。在我们的医疗研究工作中，中西医要更紧密地团结协作，青老要更好的结合。更有系统地深入地继承和发扬祖国医学，使我国的医学成为世界上最新的最完整的医学理论体系。同志们，我们的任务是繁多而艰巨的，但有毛泽东思想的红旗永远引导着我们奋勇前进。只要我们听党的话，跟着党走，则攻无不克，战无不胜。高举着毛主席的胜利旗帜，我们满怀信心，一定能够胜利完成党所交给我们的光荣的历史任务。
    在主观愿望上，我们每一个医务工作者都有决心或至少想把工作做好，把任务完成，或超额完成。但究竟结果如何，在很大程度上，有赖于每一个人的立场观点和思想方法。离开世界观和方法论，很难想像能把工作（如研究工作）做好，因为方法论错了，其研究结果也必然会错的，否则也必然是少慢差费的。我们从旧社会来的知识分子，特别是我自己，由于历史条件关系，必须加紧努力学习政治、学习马列主义和毛主席的著作，同时也必须到工农群众中去，参加劳动锻炼，和群众化为一体，建立对工农群众的感情，以便加速自我改造。改造自己旧的世界观，树立无产阶级的世界观，这样才有可能改造成为工人阶级的又红又专的卫生工作者。现在请允许我引用毛主席的著作为我自己和大家共同学习和自我改造的珍贵文献。毛主席说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点，而不在乎口讲什么三民主义或马克思主义。真正的革命者必定是愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合的。”以上毛主席的一段话是考验和鉴别我们每一个知识分子是否真正接受改造，真正赞成和支持革命最好不过的试金石。
    通过反复学习毛主席这段话以后，我得到了很深刻的教育和启发，使我联系到我过去数十年在工作中，由于旧的观点和思想方法占了上风，我只走高高在上的错误的资产阶级的所谓专家路线，我看不见群众路线的伟大真理和作用。特别严重的是解放后，我仍走这条错误的白专道路，忽视群众路线工作方法的重要性，这样一方面使我在工作中强调个人兴趣，往往脱离群众，未发挥群众的智慧和力量，未发挥群众的积极性和创造性，因而造成工作上的损失。在研究工作中，因为我忽视群众路线，助长了很臭的个人主义思想的发展，使我脑子发热。在工作上稍微做出微不足道的渺小的成绩，就忘本不思源。不但不归功于党，而更虚心地学习政治，学习毛主席的著作，以便更好地为人民服务，反而骄傲自大，幸亏党在整风、反右期间及时地敲起警钟，耐心地教育了我，挽救了我。否则，发展下去，我势必陷入右派泥坑。因此，我永远感谢党所给予我的教育和改造的机会。我一定要进一步改造自己，做好工作来报答党对我的关怀与期待。通过学习毛主席的著作及其他有关文献，结合参观大跃进以来祖国社会主义建设的辉煌成就以后，我深深认识到群众的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的。无论在任何工作中，应以一个普通劳动者的身份出现于集体之中，而不应自居于集体之上。我必须牢牢记住：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。毛主席曾说：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往幼稚得可笑的。我也必须牢牢记住：对待群众运动的态度问题，从来是马克思主义者和反马克思主义者争论的根本问题之一。在社会主义建设中，这同样是一个根本问题。马克思主义者对新生事物一向敏感，一向采取坚决爱护的态度而不怕它有缺点。
    在总路线光辉照耀下及党的英明领导下，北京市各医疗卫生单位自1958年大跃进以来，认真贯彻党的卫生工作方针政策、坚持政治挂帅、走群众路线、打破迷信、解放思想、大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，在各个卫生战线上均取得了巨大胜利，无论在爱国卫生运动除四害灭病、临床医疗、预防、教学、研究、干部培养、药品、器材、以及工厂学校城市乡村等等卫生工作，均有全面跃进的伟大成绩，对于首都人民健康的保护和首都的伟大社会主义建设事业的不断大跃进起到很大作用。我在北京医学院附属的北京人民医院和中苏友谊医院工作。在总路线的光辉照耀下和医院党委的正确领导下，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的卫生教育方针。无论在政治思想、临床医疗、教学、科学研究、技术革新、培养干部，以及以医院为中心的城市及农村卫生工作等，均打破条件论，取得一定成绩。因限于时间，不在此详细汇报。因限于篇幅，故不在此做全面介绍。
    现在就中苏友谊医院在大跃进以来关于学习苏联医学先进经验的情况，向大会汇报如下：
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，在市委和医院党委领导下，中苏友谊医院从1958年大跃进来，医院在所担负着的学习和传播苏联医学先进经验，临床科学研究以及培养干部等各项任务方面，均取得了显著成绩。
    在传播苏联医学先进经验方面，两年来全院医务人员均学习苏联先进医学，其中有积极分子一百四十五人。在临床应用苏联新的治疗方法达二百二十一项，翻译苏联文献一千五百二十六篇，翻译苏联专业著作十七本（约一百八十万字，已出版六本），根据不完全的统计，已发表翻译论文三百六十八篇（包括文摘）。通过这些活动不仅对全国医学界有所贡献，而医院在原苏联专家培植的基础上，在新聘请的苏联专家的指导帮助下，在青年医务人员的努力下，医疗质量和医疗水平已有了大大的提高，全院有不少疾病的治疗已赶上或超过本国的或资本主义国家的水平，例如应用苏联先进的奴夫卡因疗法，治疗八十例多年不愈的胃溃疡病，有效率达97.5％。又如脑出血疾病死亡率从1959年9月至1960年2月三十一例的病死率，已降低到35％（1958年至1959年8月五十九例，死亡率52.5％）比国内报告最低的（1958年底三个月三十四例）52％的病死率大大地降低，新成立的脑外科，在一年中做了脑瘤手术五十四例，病死率仅为7.4％，比查到的国内和美国、日本文献资料为低，儿科在抢救肺炎方面，从1958年三百七十八例的死亡率10.05％到1959年三百二十七例死亡率减为0.31％，均已超过国内和国外水平，在抢救中毒性痢疾方面，儿科利用人工冬眠综合疗法胜利地将病死率从1958年为29.2％降低到1959年的5.2％，比上海在1958年为31.1％降低了29.2％。外科脾胃等手术治疗率比国内和美国的水平为高，如脾臂静脉吻合术，死亡率为3％，比国内同期4.8％者为低，比美国为14％者更低。
    在结合临床进行科学研究方面：两年来共完成研究项目及临床实践总结一百七十九项，其中护理学方面四十五项，共发表有关文章一百三十六篇，出版论文集，简报二期，总结编写专科经验集二册。其中有四十七项已超过资本主义国家水平。
    在培养干部方面，除本院干部通过科研、学习及临床实践有显著提高外，两年共培养进修医师（包括短期进修）一百四十四名，1958年四十九名，1959年九十五名，较1957年五十四名大有增加。此外，我院创办了业余高级护理进修班及业余护士学校（共参加学习的有八十五人），大大提高了护理质量。
    两年来医疗工作量有显著跃进：1957年门
  （急）诊量十七万九千六百一十人次，病床三百八十张，1958年门（急）诊增加到三十二万二千零七十一人次，较1957年增加80％，1958年病床四百九十张，较1957年增28.9％。1959年门（急）诊三十九万一千九百一十人次，又较1958年增21％，病床五百二十一张，较1958年增加6.3％。在乡村防治工作方面，我院经常有医务人员轮流负责，协助郊区周口店医院、良乡医院、良乡修配厂医院，解决诊断治疗及培养干部等问题。
    最近在医院党委领导下，全院掀起了一个技术革新高潮，三天内提出了建议七万多件。医务人员利用三根塑料管和小气球，做成了一个很好的三腔管以代替舶来品，外科创造了缩短低温麻醉后病人体温复温时间，减少病人痛苦。医务人员和工人们苦干巧干，已胜利完成了自制的尖端医疗器械人工肾。现在全院的技术革新运动正向深入发展。
    以上所述我院大跃进以来的成绩都是在院党委领导下，政治挂帅，认真贯彻了党的卫生工作方针政策及认真贯彻了总路线大跃进大搞群众运动所取得的，对我来说又是一场有深刻意义的教育和启发。为了更好地为祖国人民服务，我坚决地要努力学习政治，和毛主席的著作，彻底改造自己。听党的话，做党的驯服工具，永远跟着党走。
    同志们，毛泽东时代是一天等于二十年的伟大时代，是天翻地复，山河变样，帝国主义发抖的时代，但中国人民的死敌美帝国主义仍然侵占着我们祖国神圣领土台湾。我保证跟大家一起坚决拥护三大法宝，紧密的团结在党的周围，力争上游，鼓足更大的干劲，贡献一切力量，搞好卫生工作，为建设祖国社会主义事业，为粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋，为解放台湾，为保卫祖国和世界和平而努力奋斗。
    最后，让我们欢呼：伟大的毛主席万岁！伟大的中国共产党万岁！伟大的全国各族人民大团结万岁！伟大的祖国万岁！伟大的牢不可破的中苏友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！
