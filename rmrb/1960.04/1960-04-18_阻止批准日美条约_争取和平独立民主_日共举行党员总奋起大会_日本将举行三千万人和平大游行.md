Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee today held a massive "General Mobilization Meeting of Party Members to Prevent Approval of the New Security Treaty" in Tokyo. More than 12,000 people, including JCP members, family members, and members of the Democratic Youth League, participated in the meeting. At the meeting, JCP General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto delivered a report on behalf of the JCP Central Committee, calling on all party members to strengthen their confidence, stand at the forefront of the people, and fight to prevent the Diet from approving the new "Security Treaty." Miyamoto pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" was concluded by Japanese monopoly capital in collusion with U.S. imperialism as a means to re-invade Asia and suppress the struggle of the Japanese people.

	Miyamoto emphasized that the struggle against the "Security Treaty" has not only developed into a nationwide struggle in Japan, but has also received the support of China, the Soviet Union, Asian, African countries and the people of the world, and the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.

	Miyamoto pointed out that at this important stage, JCP members must, through the 15th National Unified Action, strive to organize more workers to launch strikes and successfully hold an orderly petition to the Diet by tens of thousands of representatives on April 26th.

	Mori Fumie, vice-chairman of the Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union Women's Association, who is persisting in the struggle against dismissal, spoke at the meeting. She firmly stated that the Miike coal miners and their families will unite even more closely, rely on the strength of all the people, and fight to the end to win the final victory. At this moment, thunderous applause rang out in the venue.

	Tanaka Toshio, chairman of the People's Movement Committee of the Socialist Party, addressed the meeting as a guest, saying that in the glorious struggle for national independence and peace, the Socialist Party is willing to join hands with the JCP and fight together with all the people.

	Also addressing the meeting were representatives from the Secretariat of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Okinawa People's Party, the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy, and the Democratic Youth League.

	The meeting unanimously adopted resolutions on strengthening the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and supporting the struggle of the Miike coal miners.

	The declaration adopted by the meeting pointed out that the time has come for all Japanese people who demand peace, independence, and democracy to stand up and fight. The declaration stated that all participants will stand at the forefront of the people, smash the conspiracy to suppress the people, and strive for victory in the struggle to prevent approval and strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," and further open up the road to realizing a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan.

	After the meeting, all participants held high red flags and placards and held a demonstration on the streets.

	The meeting will send sixty representatives to the Diet tomorrow to petition, and protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. Embassy in Japan regarding the conclusion of a military alliance treaty between Japan and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs announced today that it will hold a peace parade with a total of 30 million participants nationwide to express its firm opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," opposition to Japan's implementation of nuclear armament, and demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

	According to the plan announced by the council, the total length of the parade will be 10,000 kilometers. Starting from April 24th, the marching teams will set off from seven places, including Okinawa Island and Hokkaido, and will finally converge in Tokyo on August 5th, when the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Comprehensive Disarmament will be held. Along the way, the marching teams will pass through 214 U.S. military bases and "Self-Defense Force" military bases, calling on the people in these places to fight against the new "Security Treaty" and strive for peace.

  代表日共中央作了报告，号召全体党员坚定信心，站在人民的前头，为阻止国会批准新“安全条约”而斗争。宫本指出，新“安全条约”是日本垄断资本伙同美帝国主义作为它重新侵略亚洲、同时镇压日本人民斗争的手段而缔结的。
    宫本强调指出，反对“安全条约”的斗争目前不仅发展成为日本全民性斗争，而且得到了中苏两国和亚非各国以及全世界人民的支持，最后胜利一定属于日本人民。
      宫本指出，在目前重要阶段，
  日共党员必须通过第十五次全国统一行动，为组织更多工人展开罢工和争取在4月26日成功地举行数万名代表向国会进行有秩序的请愿而奋斗。
    正在坚持反对解雇的斗争的三池煤矿工会妇女会副会长森文枝在大会上讲了话。她坚决表示，三池煤矿工人和工人家属将更加团结起来，依靠全体人民的力量，为争取最后胜利而斗争到底。这时，会场响起了春雷般的热烈掌声。
    大会来宾、社会党国民运动委员会委员长田中稔男在会上致词时表示，在争取民族独立与和平这个光荣斗争中，社会党愿意同日共携起手来，并同全体人民在一起展开斗争。
    在会上致词的还有，阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三和冲绳人民党、东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议、民主青年同盟的代表等。
    大会一致通过了关于加强反对“安全条约”斗争和关于支援三池煤矿工人斗争的决议。
    大会通过的宣言指出，要求和平、独立、民主的全体日本人民应该站起来斗争的时候已经到来。宣言表示，全体与会者将站在人民的前列，粉碎镇压人民的阴谋，为在阻止批准和争取废除新“安全条约”斗争中获得胜利，并进一步开辟实现和平、独立、民主、中立的日本的道路而奋斗。
    全体与会者在大会结束后高举着红旗和标语牌，到街上举行了示威游行。
    大会明天将派遣六十名代表到国会进行请愿，并且就日美缔结军事同盟条约向岸信介政府和美国驻日大使馆提出抗议。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会今天宣布要在全国举行共有三千万人参加的和平大游行，以表示坚决反对新日美“安全条约”，反对日本实行核武装，要求禁止核武器。
