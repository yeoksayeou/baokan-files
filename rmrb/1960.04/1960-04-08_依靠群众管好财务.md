    Rely on the Masses to Manage Finances Well
    From the news in today's paper about Zixi County People's Commune improving financial management and Chuandi Management Area of Chengguan Commune in Ping顺县 (Ping Shun County) implementing a cost accounting system, it can be clearly seen that financial work is a very important part of the operation and management of the People's Commune. Continuously improving financial management work can promote more rapid production development, further improve the lives of commune members, and promote the consolidation and development of the People's Commune system.
    Financial work is an important means of arranging production and distribution. With a sound financial system, production and distribution can be rationally arranged, the ratio of accumulation and consumption can be correctly handled, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members can be mobilized, the financial and material resources of the commune can be used more effectively, and various production and construction undertakings of the commune can be organized in a planned way.
    The fundamental purpose of strengthening financial management and implementing economic accounting is to use every penny of financial and material resources in the most needed places, so as to achieve greater economic results with less labor costs. After the Chuandi Management Area implemented the cost accounting system, last year's production costs were reduced by two-thirds compared with the previous year, management costs were reduced to only one-thousandth of the total income, and more than 5,000 workdays were saved, while the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries increased by 79% compared with the previous year. This is a successful example of strengthening financial management to promote production development.
    After the establishment of the People's Commune, there are more production projects, a wider scope of operation, and because of the changes in the distribution system, a part of the consumption of commune members is also managed by the commune in a unified way. Financial work is more arduous and complicated than in the past agricultural cooperative era. But this is only one aspect of the problem. It should also be seen that the commune also has its advantages of "many soldiers and capable generals, and a wealth of talent." As long as the Party's leadership is strengthened and the wisdom and strength of the broad masses are brought into full play, it is entirely possible to manage the commune's financial work well. To do a good job in financial work, financial accountants must have a certain level of professional competence, but more importantly, they must have a high degree of political consciousness and place financial work under the strict supervision of the masses. Zixi County's communes have quickly formed a financial accounting team that is both red and expert by continuously carrying out communist education, launching socialist emulation campaigns, and holding several training classes for financial accountants, ensuring that financial work is becoming increasingly sound. Not only that, in order to mobilize the masses to participate in financial management, while publicizing the accounts, they also took a series of measures to facilitate the masses, such as changing accounting terms to local terms and changing lowercase to uppercase. It seems that these are just some technical problems of minor importance, but in fact, this is a concrete way of handing over financial management to the supervision of the masses. In this way, the masses have a clear understanding of the commune's financial management situation, which is convenient for providing help and supervision.

    依靠群众管好财务
    从今天本报发表的资溪县人民公社改进财务管理、平顺县城关公社川底管理区实行成本核算制的消息中，可以清楚地看出：财务工作是人民公社经营管理中一个非常重要的部分，不断改进财务管理工作，就可以促进生产更迅速地发展和进一步改善社员生活，促进人民公社制度的巩固和发展。
    财务工作是安排生产和分配的重要手段。有了健全的财务制度，才能合理地安排生产和分配，正确地处理积累和消费的比例，也才能调动广大社员的积极性和更加有效地使用公社的财力、物力，有计划地组织公社各项生产建设事业。
    加强财务管理，实行经济核算的根本目的是：把每一分财力、物力都使用到最需要的地方，达到以较少的工本取得较大的经济效果。川底管理区实行成本核算制以后，去年的生产费用比前年降低三分之二，管理费用降低到只占总收入千分之一，并节约了劳动日五千多个，而农林牧副业的总产值却比前年增加79％。这是加强财务管理促进生产发展的一个成功范例。
    人民公社成立后，生产项目更多，经营范围更广，而且由于分配制度的改变，社员一部分消费也由公社统一管理，财务工作比过去农业社时期更加繁重、更加复杂了。但这只是问题的一个方面，还应该看到，公社也有它“兵多将广、人才辈出”的有利方面。只要加强党的领导，充分发挥广大群众的智慧和力量，管理好公社的财务工作是完全可能的。要做好财务工作，财务会计人员固然要有一定的业务水平，但更重要的是要有高度的政治觉悟，并把财务工作放在群众的严密监督之下。资溪县各公社就是通过不断进行共产主义教育，开展社会主义评比竞赛运动，并举办了几次财务会计人员训练班，很快就组成了一支又红又专的财务会计队伍，保证了财务工作日益健全。不仅如此，他们为了发动群众参加财务管理，在公布账目的同时，还采取了一系列的便利群众的措施，如把会计术语改成当地用语，改小写为大写等。看起来这好像只是一些细微末节的技术问题，其实不然，这是把财务管理交给群众监督的一种具体做法。这样，群众对公社的财务管理情况就一目了然，便于进行帮助和监督。
