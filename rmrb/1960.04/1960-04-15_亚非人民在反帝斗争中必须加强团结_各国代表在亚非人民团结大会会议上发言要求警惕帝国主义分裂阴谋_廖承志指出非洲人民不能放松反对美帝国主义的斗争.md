Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 13th: The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 13th, where heads of delegations from various countries continued to speak.

    Diallo, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, spoke on behalf of the Permanent Secretariat. He congratulated the conference and guaranteed the support and cooperation of the All-African People's Conference for the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. He called on the people of Asian and African countries to take joint action against the imperialist policy of "divide and rule." He said that if any part of the two continents remained under foreign rule, the independence of any independent Asian or African country would not be guaranteed.
    Kiwánuka, head of the Ugandan delegation, said that since the Bandung Conference, the imperialists had seen that their rule was coming to a tragic end. Therefore, they hastened to plot military conspiracies, organize military treaty organizations, and did not hesitate to propagate divisions between Asia and Africa.
    He demanded that his country be granted immediate independence. He said that the people of Uganda now demand immediate and complete national independence. He said that brutal colonial measures have not weakened our demands for independence. On the contrary, these measures have strengthened this demand.
    He said, we demand that elections be held immediately based on a universal suffrage system of one person, one vote; that a national government be organized, and that complete independence be achieved no later than 1961.
    Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech at the meeting. First, on behalf of the Chinese people, he extended warm greetings to the people and government of Guinea, who had gained independence, and expressed that the Chinese people will always support the just cause of the Guinean people.
    Liao Chengzhi said, "In the past two years, since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the world situation has undergone tremendous changes. The forces against imperialism and colonialism have become increasingly strong and have achieved one victory after another, while the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is nearing its end."
    Liao Chengzhi said that the victories of the Asian, African, and Latin American people over the past two years have proven that "whether it is the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, or any other imperialism, they are all just paper tigers." At the same time, he said: "Imperialists are die-hards. They will use all means to carry out armed suppression, or resort to sweet words to carry out sabotage and division activities, to divide our forces, in order to maintain their criminal rule and restore what they have already lost. Therefore, our struggle against imperialism is bound to be a long and arduous struggle."
    He said, "As long as we believe in the strength of our people and persist in our struggle, we will surely win the final victory and become masters of our own land."
    In his speech, Liao Chengzhi said that the Chinese people deeply sympathize with and fully support the heroic struggles of the Asian and African people.
    He said, we believe that "based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, Asian and African countries can consolidate and develop their friendly relations. No imperialist conspiracy or sabotage can ever undermine our unity, friendship, and cooperation."
    In his report, Liao Chengzhi emphasized the ambitions and conspiracies of the United States in Africa. He said, "The United States maintains its naval and air bases in many parts of Africa, intensifies economic infiltration, and engages in all kinds of conspiracies against the people of African countries. While struggling against other colonialists, people must always be vigilant and never relax in the struggle against U.S. imperialism."
    Representatives from Somaliland and Zanzibar called on the delegates to be vigilant against the imperialist conspiracy to divide the unity of the Asian and African people. They pointed out that strengthening Asian-African unity is the sacred duty of every Asian and African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
    Tidiane Baidy, representative of the Mali Federation and the Black African Asian-African Solidarity Committee, condemned French imperialism. He also condemned the imperialists for obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.
    Yemeni representative Ahmed Mohammed Pasha condemned the British occupation of large areas of southern Yemen in his speech. He said that the people of both North and South Yemen reject any attempt to divide their country.
    He said that Yemeni territory has been repeatedly attacked by British armed forces, especially in southern Yemen, which is a strong position that has never succumbed to the enemy. We are determined to defend our homeland and safeguard our rights. Bombs, rockets, or the destruction of our villages, as well as the barbaric actions of the British armed forces in massacring our people, can never force our people to accept a fate they cannot agree to.
    Sun Guangfa, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, condemned U.S. imperialism for preparing for war in South Vietnam in his speech. He said that as soon as the armistice agreement was signed, the U.S. imperialists established the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive bloc, and declared that South Vietnam was included in the bloc's protection zone. The U.S. imperialists constantly and illegally shipped armaments and military personnel into South Vietnam. All of these actions are serious violations of the Geneva Accords.
    He said that imperialism is doing whatever it wants in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia is seriously threatened. The cause of this threat is the interference of U.S. imperialism.
    He urged the conference to demand: 1. U.S. imperialism stop interfering in South Vietnam; 2. Immediately withdraw the U.S. military delegation in South Vietnam; 3. Correctly implement the Geneva Accords so that Vietnam can be reunified on the basis of independence and democracy.
    Boutagy Abdin, the representative of Mauritania, said at the meeting that, like all countries subjected to foreign rule, Mauritania's dignity has been trampled on, its natural wealth plundered, and the human rights of its people violated. Therefore, Mauritania is determined to smash the shackles of enslavement, thereby entering the society of sovereign and free countries. By doing so, we are making our contribution to striving for and maintaining world peace and promoting human progress.

    亚非人民在反帝斗争中必须加强团结
    各国代表在亚非人民团结大会会议上发言要求警惕帝国主义分裂阴谋
    廖承志指出非洲人民不能放松反对美帝国主义的斗争
    新华社科纳克里13日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会13日下午举行全体会议，由各国代表团团长继续发言。
    全非人民大会常设秘书处秘书长迪亚洛代表全非人民大会常设秘书处讲话。他向大会表示祝贺，并保证全非人民大会对亚非人民团结大会的支持和合作。他要求亚非各国人民采取联合行动反对帝国主义的“分而治之”的政策。他说，如果两大洲的任何部分仍然处于外国的统治之下，任何独立的亚非国家的独立性就将没有保证。
    乌干达代表团团长基瓦努卡说，自从万隆会议以来，帝国主义看到了它们的统治即将悲惨地结束。因此它们赶紧策划军事阴谋，组织军事条约组织，它们也毫不犹豫地宣传亚非之间的分歧。
    他要求他的祖国立即获得独立。他说，乌干达人民现在要求立即得到完全的民族独立。他说，残酷的殖民主义措施并没有削弱我们的独立要求。恰恰相反，这些措施加强了这种要求。
    他说，我们要求立即根据一人一票的普遍选举制度举行选举；要求组织民族政府，要求不迟于1961年获得完全独立。
    中国代表团团长廖承志在会上发表讲话。他首先代表中国人民向获得了独立的几内亚人民和政府热烈致意，并表示中国人民永远支持几内亚人民的正义事业。
    廖承志说，“在过去两年中，自从第一届亚非人民团结大会以来，世界局势已经有了巨大的变化。反对帝国主义和殖民主义的力量日益强大，取得了一个接一个的胜利，而以美国为首的帝国主义集团则正日暮途穷”。
    廖承志说，亚非人民和拉丁美洲人民两年来的胜利证明了：“不管是美国、英国、法国、比利时、葡萄牙或者是其它任何帝国主义，都不过是纸老虎。”同时，他又说：“帝国主义者是死硬派。他们将不择手段想尽办法来进行武装镇压，或者借助于甜言蜜语来进行破坏和分裂活动，来分化我们的力量，以便保持他们的罪恶统治和恢复他们所已经失掉的东西。因此，我们反对帝国主义的斗争势必是长期艰巨的斗争”。
    他说，“只要我们相信我们人民的力量并坚持我们的斗争，我们定将获得最后的胜利，而成为我们自己土地上的主人。”
    廖承志在讲话中说，中国人民深切同情并且完全支持亚非人民的英勇斗争。
    他说，我们相信，“依据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，亚非各国是能够巩固和发展它们之间的友好关系的。任何帝国主义的阴谋和破坏活动，都休想破坏我们的团结、友谊和合作”。
    廖承志在报告中强调指出美国在非洲的野心和阴谋。他说，“美国保持着自己在非洲许多地方的海军和空军基地，加紧进行经济渗入，并从事各式各样的阴谋，来反对非洲各国人民。在同其它殖民主义进行斗争的时候，人们必须始终警惕并毫不放松反对美帝国主义的斗争”。
    索马里兰的代表和桑给巴尔的代表要求代表们警惕帝国主义企图分裂亚非人民的团结的阴谋，他们指出，加强亚非团结是每一个亚非人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中的神圣责任。
    马里联邦和黑非洲亚非团结委员会代表提迪安·拜迪在讲话中谴责法国帝国主义。他同时谴责帝国主义阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位的作法。
    也门代表艾哈迈德·穆罕默德·帕夏在讲话中谴责英国占领也门南部的大片土地。他说，也门南北两部分的人民拒绝分裂他们国家的任何作法。
    他说，也门的领土曾经一再遭受英国武装部队的攻击，特别是在也门南部，而也门南部是一个坚强的阵地，从来没有向敌人屈服过。我们坚决保卫我们的国土，维护我们的权利。炸弹、火箭或者对我们的乡村的破坏以及英国武装部队大肆屠杀我国人民群众的野蛮行动，决不能迫使我国人民接受他们所不能同意的命运。
    越南民主共和国代表团团长孙光阀在讲话中谴责美帝国主义在南越准备战争。他说，停战协定刚刚签订，美帝国主义者就建立了东南亚条约组织这个侵略集团，并宣布把南越包括在这个集团的保护区域之内，美帝国主义者不断把军备和军事人员非法地运入南越，所有这一切行动都是严重地违反日内瓦协议。
    他说，帝国主义在南越和东南亚肆意为所欲为，越南和东南亚的和平受到了严重的威胁，造成这种威胁的原因就是美帝国主义的干涉。
    他敦请大会要求：一、美帝国主义停止在南越进行干涉；二、立即撤出在南越的美国军事代表团；三、正确执行日内瓦协议，以使越南得以在独立和民主的基础上重新统一。
    毛里塔尼亚的代表布塔吉·阿卜丁在会上说，像所有遭受外国统治的国家一样，毛里塔尼亚的尊严受到蹂躏，它的自然财富被掠夺，人民的人权受到侵犯，因此毛里塔尼亚决心要粉碎奴役的锁链，从而进入拥有主权的自由国家的社会，我们这样做，也就是在争取和维护世界和平以及促进人类进步方面作出了我们的贡献。
