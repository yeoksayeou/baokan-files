Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the national financial front is advancing with tremendous momentum. This movement has brought about a technical revolution to the manual operations that have been followed in various departments of the bank.

    Bank cadres who had never touched machines broke through difficulties such as not understanding technology, having no tools, and lacking materials, and successively created tools and machines such as coin counters, banknote bundling machines, banknote counting machines, coin change dispensers, and interest calculators. Not only are there complete sets of mechanized and semi-mechanized tools in accounting and cashier departments, but also card drawers, statistical report collators, envelope sealing machines, electric mimeograph machines, and other machines have been created in savings, statistics, printing, and other departments. The use of these mechanized tools generally increases efficiency by one to twenty times compared to manual operation. After the Nantong People's Bank branch in Jiangsu Province promoted more than 800 tools and machines, with a 73% increase in business volume, the number of cashiers and counting staff was reduced from the original seventeen to seven.

    Various tools and machines created and invented by banking departments in various regions are immediately finalized and promoted after successful trial production. 90% of the tools and machines created and invented in Hebei Province have been applied to practical work. All county people's bank branches in Zhejiang Province have realized the tooling of coin counting and packaging, 50% of the branches and offices have realized the carting of banknotes and coins into the warehouse, 30% of the branches and offices have realized the mechanization of re-counting main currencies, the electrification of voucher transmission, and 20% of the branches and offices have realized the tooling of document mimeographing and binding. Many machines are continuously improved and upgraded in the process of promotion and use, becoming increasingly perfect. In 1958, banknote counting machines were only successfully trial-produced in a few areas, and were not perfect enough in terms of form, type, and quality. After more than a year of repeated experiments and research, various banknote counting machines have now appeared in various places. Among them are electric, hand-cranked, and foot-operated banknote counting machines, as well as photosensitive, lever, and contact banknote counting machines. These banknote counting machines count accurately, are small in size, and are equipped with automatic sorting parts to make the banknotes neatly counted and easy to operate.

    Bank employees in various regions also vigorously cooperated with factories, enterprises, and rural people's communes to help various units improve their accounting and cashier operating techniques and exchange technical innovation experiences. Some banks provide enterprises with technical materials to assist in the manufacture of banknote counting machines and machines for counting meal tickets and food stamps; some cooperate with other units to help textile factories develop yarn cloth bundling machines based on the principle of yarn bundling machines, and assist paper mills, button factories, and cigarette factories to develop paper counting machines, button counting machines, and cigarette box counting machines based on the principle of banknote counting machines, which are welcomed by various units.

    Not long ago, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China convened a national financial work technical innovation experience exchange conference in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, and widely exchanged technical innovation experiences on the financial front. The conference pointed out that the financial front must also launch a mass movement and vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. In the technical innovation movement, the machines, tools, and advanced operating methods that have been created must be quickly identified and promoted, and experience must be summarized from practice, continuously improved and upgraded, so that they become increasingly perfect. The technical innovation and technical revolution movements inside and outside the bank must be closely integrated to promote the rapid development of the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    金融战线技术革命汹涌澎湃
    创造出成套的机械化半机械化工具，比手工操作提高效率一到二十倍
    据新华社南京电  全国金融战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以汹涌澎湃之势向前推进，这一运动已使银行各部门沿袭的手工操作，来了一次技术大革命。
    从来不摸机器的银行干部，冲破了不懂技术，没有工具，缺乏材料等等难关，接二连三地创造出了硬币计数器、捆钞机、点钞机、硬币找零器、利息计算器等工具和机器。不仅在会计出纳方面有了成套的机械化和半机械化工具，在储蓄、统计、文印等方面也创造了抽账卡器、统计报表并表器、信封封口机、电动油印机等机器。使用这些机械化工具，一般比手工操作提高效率一倍到二十倍。江苏省南通人民银行支行推行了八百多件工具和机器以后，在业务量增加73％的情况下，出纳整点人员却由原来的十七人减为七人。
    各地银行部门创造发明的各种工具和机器，都在试制成功以后立即定型，加以推广。河北省创造发明的工具和机器90％已经运用到实际工作中。浙江省各县人民银行支行全部实现了硬币清点、包装工具化，50％的行、处实现了纸币、硬币入库车子化，30％的行、处实现了复点主币机械化，凭证传递电动化，20％的行、处实现了文件油印、装订工具化。许多机器在推广使用的过程中，不断得到改进、提高，日趋完善，1958年，点钞机仅在少数地区试制成功，而且在形式上、种类上和质量上都不够完善。经过一年多的反复试验研究，现在各地已出现了各种各样的点钞机。其中有电动、手摇、脚踏的点钞机，有感光、杠杆、接点点钞机。这些点钞机计数准确，体积小巧，并且安装了自动整理部分，使钞票清点整齐，操作方便。
    各地银行职工还同各工厂企业、农村人民公社大搞协作，帮助各单位提高会计、出纳操作技术，交流技术革新经验。有些银行供给企业单位技术资料，协助制造点钞机和点饭票、点粮票的机器；有的同其它单位协作，帮助纺织厂根据捆纱机的原理制成纱布捆包机，协助造纸厂、钮扣厂、卷烟厂仿照点钞机的原理制数纸机、数扣机、烟盒查数机，受到各单位的欢迎。
    不久以前，中国人民银行总行在江苏省南通市召开了全国金融工作技术革新经验交流会议，广泛地交流了金融战线上的技术革新经验。会议指出，金融战线也必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命。在技术革新运动中，对已经创造出的机器、工具和先进操作方法，必须迅速进行鉴定推广，从实践中总结经验，不断改进提高，使它们日趋完善。银行内部和银行外部的技术革新和技术革命运动必须紧密结合，促进全民的技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展。
