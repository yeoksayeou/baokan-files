Chairman, fellow members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC.

In 1959, under the leadership of the CCP Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the CCP Anhui Provincial Committee, and under the glorious illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, our Anhui achieved brilliant accomplishments in industrial and agricultural production and other fields. In mid-March, we had the opportunity to participate in the Anhui inspection group organized by national people's representatives and CPPCC members, and conducted inspections in Hefei City, Lu'an Prefecture, and Bengbu Prefecture. These areas have not only achieved continued leaps forward in industry and agriculture since last year, but also have achieved great development in culture, education, sports, and health. Now, please allow me to talk about the canalization of Zilu Lake in Sanba People's Commune, Su County, Anhui.

Zilu Lake in Sanba People's Commune is located about fifteen li southeast of Su County, on the right side of the Jinpu Railway. There are twenty-six villages along the lake, with a population of more than six thousand, a total area of about twenty-four square kilometers, and thirty-six thousand mu of land. The terrain is low-lying, and it was flooded nine out of ten years before liberation. In good years, the yield per mu was only sixty jin. Every summer and autumn, it was either drought and insect plagues or a vast expanse of water. Before liberation, a folk song was popular here:

	Zilu Lake is a desolate place, it makes people sad to think about it,
	It's either drought and insect plagues, or toads making camp.
	One year of bran and vegetables is not enough to eat, supporting the old and carrying the young to flee to other places,
	Girls don't marry into Zilu Lake, and men don't want to return home.

However, after liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Zilu Lake have continuously struggled against natural disasters and built water conservancy projects year by year. Especially since the winter of 1957, the provincial party committee, based on the central government's "three main" principles for water management, put forward the great call of "canalization, water conservancy, and transforming Huaibei into Jiangnan," which inspired the masses' enthusiasm for water management and strengthened the masses' confidence and determination to conquer natural disasters, thereby setting off a high tide of water management. From the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, 1.1 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed. Especially in the autumn of 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, the superiority of the people's commune, which is "large in size and public in nature," was fully demonstrated. The socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of the people was greatly improved, and the continuous reform of water management tools greatly accelerated the speed of water conservancy construction. The entire commune mobilized 17,000 laborers, and in only fifty days, they dredged 157 rivers and ditches of all sizes and completed more than 4.4 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects, with a water storage capacity of more than 183,300 cubic meters.

Now, Zilu Lake is interconnected with rivers and ditches, forming a complete canal system, which has not only withstood the test of severe natural disasters, but has also initially changed the past situation of multiple disasters and low yields. For example, in June, July, and August of 1959, during the growing season of crops, the rainfall in these ninety days was only 219 millimeters, while the evaporation was 580 millimeters during the same period. Thanks to the canalization of water conservancy construction, it was possible to irrigate more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields under such severe drought conditions, with an average yield of 527 jin, of which more than 1,000 mu reached more than 1,000 jin per mu. The total output in 1959 increased by 51% compared with 1958.

The basic realization of the canalization of Zilu Lake has not only increased grain production and achieved continuous leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, but also greatly developed forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. For example, 2.96 million trees of various kinds have been planted on the river embankments, more than 1 million fish have been raised, and more than 10,000 poultry and livestock have been raised.

As production continues to develop, the lives of commune members have gradually improved. According to our investigation in Chen Village, Zilu Lake, the yield per mu of grain in 1959 increased by 7.3 times compared with 1946, and the income per commune member reached 105 yuan, an increase of 5.4 times compared with 1946. The situation of famine and disease before liberation has now been completely eradicated. Now, another folk song is widely circulated among the people of Zilu Lake, praising the new changes in Zilu Lake:

	Zilu Lake is a good place, with orchards and forests and granaries full of rice,
	Girls look forward to marrying into Zilu Lake, and men are willing to return home.

The development of production has also brought about the continuous expansion of public accumulation, and agricultural capital construction has also been increasingly developed. For example, in 1959, the Zilu Lake brigade purchased two tractors, two 60-horsepower water pumps, 85 head of cattle, more than 1,000 large farm implements, and 31 large and small wooden boats.

Facts have proved that the earth-shaking changes in Zilu Lake are inseparable from the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. As the commune members said, "Canalization is the root of happiness, and the people's commune is the root of the root." Therefore, we can assert that the vast rural areas of our country are moving towards a more beautiful and happier socialist road with the consolidation and expansion of the people's communes.

At present, the situation in our country is developing rapidly. In order to meet the requirements of the situation, we deeply feel that in the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must accelerate our political and ideological transformation, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly transform the bourgeois stand and world outlook, actively participate in work practice, improve our ability to serve socialism, and continue to strive to defend the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and for the socialist construction of the motherland!

    人民公社是幸福根
    戴戟委员谈视察安徽宿县紫芦湖河网化的观感主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会常委会的工作报告。
    1959年，在中共中央、毛主席和中共安徽省委的领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我们安徽在工农业生产及其他各个方面都获得了辉煌的成就。3月中旬，我们有机会参加了全国人民代表、政协委员所组织的安徽视察团，在合肥市、六安专区和蚌埠专区进行了视察。这些地区，去年以来，不仅在工农业方面取得了继续大跃进，而且在文化、教育、体育、卫生等方面也都获得了很大的发展。现在，请允许我谈一谈安徽宿县三八人民公社紫芦湖河网化的情况。
    三八人民公社的紫芦湖距宿县东南约十五华里，位于津浦铁路右侧。沿湖共二十六个村庄，六千多人口，总面积约二十四平方公里，三万六千亩土地。地势低洼，解放前十年九淹，好年成每亩产量只不过六十斤，每年逢夏秋之际，不是干旱虫灾，就是一片汪洋。解放前这里曾流传一首歌谣：
        紫芦湖大老荒，提起来人悲伤，
        不是干旱虫灾起，就是蛤蟆安营房。
        一年糠菜吃不饱，扶老携幼奔他乡，
        姑娘不嫁紫芦湖，汉子不愿回家乡。
    然而，解放以后，紫芦湖的人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，不断地向自然灾害作斗争，逐年兴修水利；特别是自1957年冬，省委根据中央治水“三主”方针，提出了“河网化，水利化，变淮北为江南”的伟大号召，鼓舞了广大群众治水的积极性，增强了群众征服自然灾害的信心和决心，从而掀起了治水的高潮。从1957年冬到1958年春，完成一百一十万土方，特别是1958年秋，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，广大人民群众社会主义、共产主义觉悟大大提高，治水工具的不断改革，更大大加快了水利建设的速度。全社发动了一万七千个劳动力，仅以五十天的时间，就开浚了大大小小的河道沟渠一百五十七条，做了四百四十多万公方的水利工程，蓄水量达十八万三千三百多公方。
    现在紫芦湖已沟河相通，构成了一个完整的河网系统，不仅经受住了严重自然灾害的考验，而且已初步改变了过去多灾低产的面貌。如在1959年的6、7、8月份，正当农作物生长的季节，但在这九十天内仅降雨二百一十九毫米，而同期蒸发量却在五百八十毫米，由于有河网化的水利建设，结果在那种严重的干旱情况下，仍然保证了七千多亩水田的灌溉，平均产量达到五百二十七斤，其中有一千多亩每亩达到千斤以上。1959年全年总产量比1958年增加51％。
    紫芦湖河网化的基本实现，不仅使粮食产量有了增加，实现了1958年、1959年两年的连续跃进，同时林、牧、副、渔也有了很大的发展。如河堤上已栽植各种树木二百九十六万棵，养鱼一百多万尾，养家禽牲畜万余只。
    由于生产不断发展，社员的生活得到逐步改善，根据我们在紫芦湖陈村的调查，1959年粮食每亩单产比1946年增加七点三倍，社员每人收入达一百零五元，比1946年增加五点四倍。解放以前那种灾荒、疾病的情况，如今已彻底根除了。现在，在紫芦湖的人民当中，又普遍地流传了另一首歌谣，它歌颂着紫芦湖新的变化：
        紫芦湖好地方，果木成林米满仓，
        姑娘盼嫁紫芦湖，汉子愿意回家乡。
    生产上的发展，也带来了公共积累的不断扩大，农业基本建设也日益得到发展。如在1959年紫芦湖大队就购置了拖拉机两台，六十马力的抽水机两台，耕牛八十五头，大型农具一千多件，大小木船三十一只。
    事实证明，紫芦湖之所以发生这样天翻地覆的变化，是与人民公社的无比优越性分不开的。社员们说的好：“河网化是幸福根，人民公社是根上根”。因此，我们可以断言，我国的广大农村正随着人民公社的巩固和壮大，将要向着更美好更幸福的社会主义康庄大道迈进。
    当前我国的形势正在飞跃地向前发展。为了适应形势的要求，我们深深地感觉到今后必须在中国共产党的领导下，加速自己在政治上、思想上的改造，认真学习毛主席的著作，彻底改造资产阶级的立场和世界观，积极参加工作实践，提高为社会主义服务的工作能力，为保卫总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，为祖国的社会主义建设事业而继续努力奋斗！
