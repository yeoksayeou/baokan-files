Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 12th: The Mongolian "Truth News" today published a commentary on the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, entitled "A New Program for a Greater Leap Forward."

The commentary stated that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have been carrying out the great cause of the leap forward of the People's Republic of China since 1958, thus realizing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.

The commentary pointed out that China's plan for developing the national economy and culture in 1960 is very ambitious. China's steel production this year will reach 18.4 million tons, an increase of 38%. Coal production will reach 425 million tons, an increase of 22%. These outstanding growth figures have never been seen in the history of any capitalist country. For example, China will increase its steel production by more than 5 million tons in one year this year, while it took Britain seventeen years and the United States four years to reach this figure. The commentary said that in striving to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, hundreds of millions of Chinese working farmers are exerting greater efforts and continuously achieving brilliant results. This year, China's total agricultural output value will increase by 12% compared with last year, and the output of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton will increase by about 10%. Such an astonishing feat of annual leap forward in agricultural production has never occurred in the agricultural history of any capitalist country.

The commentary pointed out that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people are striving to fulfill the various tasks put forward by the Communist Party ahead of schedule and beyond quota with unprecedented great labor enthusiasm in order to realize the fighting program of making the motherland leap forward and developing the national economy and culture. In the first three months of this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in various factories and mines has swept across China, and at the same time, the people's communes have been further developed and consolidated. The commentary said that in the development of agricultural production, in the struggle against natural disasters, and in fully mobilizing the rural population to participate in all agricultural production processes, the people's communes have demonstrated their unparalleled superiority.

    蒙古“真理报”评我国人大二次会议
    中国人民正为祖国的跃进而努力
    技术革命运动席卷全国  人民公社进一步发展巩固
    新华社乌兰巴托12日电　蒙古“真理报”今天就中华人民共和国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议发表了一篇评论，题目是“更大跃进的新的纲领”。
    评论说，中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，从1958年开始开展了使中华人民共和国跃进的伟大事业，从而提前三年实现了第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    评论指出，1960年中国发展国民经济和文化的计划非常巨大。中国的钢产量在今年将达到一千八百四十万吨，增长38％。煤炭开采量将达到四亿二千五百万吨，增长22％。这种出色的增长数字是任何一个资本主义国家的历史上未曾有过的。例如，中国在今年一年内就将使钢产量增加五百多万吨，而为了达到这个数字，英国则用了十七年，美国用了四年。评论说，在争取提前实现中国农业发展纲要方面，数亿中国劳动农民鼓足更大的干劲，不断地取得辉煌的成就。今年中国的农业总产值将比去年增长12％，主要农业产品粮食、棉花的产量将增长10％左右。这样使农业生产年年跃进的惊人事迹，也是在任何一个资本主义国家的农业史上未曾出现过的。
    评论指出，中国人民在共产党的领导下为了实现使祖国跃进和发展国民经济及文化的战斗纲领，正以空前未有的巨大的劳动热情努力争取提前超额完成共产党所提出的各项任务。在今年前三个月中，各厂矿企业的技术革新和技术革命运动已经席卷全中国，同时人民公社有了进一步的发展和巩固。评论说，在发展农业生产、在同自然灾害作斗争以及充分动员农村人口参加农业生产的全部过程中，人民公社显示了它的无比的优越性。
