Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 15th - Our correspondent Yu Minsheng reports: Three hours after arriving in Rangoon, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and their entourage, accompanied by Burmese Federal Premier U Nu, joined the citizens of Rangoon in celebrating the joyous Burmese Water-Sprinkling Festival. Tens of thousands of Rangoon citizens welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi with the utmost enthusiasm. During the nearly three-hour celebration, welcoming crowds and Chinese guests sprinkled clear water on each other to express their sincere friendship.

Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi at yesterday afternoon's Water-Sprinkling Festival celebration were also Minister of Transport Bo Min Gaung, Minister of Finance Thakin Tin, Minister of Justice U E Maung, and Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Win.

Shortly after noon, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the other Chinese guests put on Burmese clothing and slippers. When they arrived at Premier U Nu's residence wearing these Burmese national costumes, Premier U Nu humorously asked, "Who is Chinese? Who is Burmese?" Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi replied, "We are all 'Pauk Phaw' (kinfolk)." The hosts and guests all laughed heartily at this question and answer.

Premier U Nu told Vice Premier Chen Yi that Premier Zhou Enlai already had rich experience with the Water-Sprinkling Festival. He said this meaning that in 1955, the Chinese Premier had participated in celebrating the same festival in Rangoon on his way to Bandung. Since then, the influence of the Bandung spirit has been continuously growing and winning the support of more and more people. The friendship between China and Burma, under the shining and nurturing light of the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit, has blossomed. Premier Zhou Enlai's re-visit to Burma and participation in Burma's Water-Sprinkling Festival will undoubtedly promote the further development of Sino-Burmese friendship, just as the water sprinkled during this festival will help the flowers to bloom.

At 2:40 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Premier U Nu, participated in the festival activities in an open car. The sun was shining brightly that day, with a gentle breeze and fresh air. Many colorful Water-Sprinkling sheds were set up throughout the city of Rangoon, each with large buckets filled with clear water. Large crowds gathered inside and outside the sheds. Young women held silver bowls, and young men held various kinds of water-sprinkling implements, including buckets, sprayers, and even water hose toys, all eagerly awaiting the arrival of the distinguished Chinese guests. As soon as they saw Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier U Nu, they became lively. Some beat gongs and drums, some played various musical instruments, and others sang songs praising Sino-Burmese friendship.

One could constantly hear people shouting slogans congratulating Sino-Burmese friendship and wishing Premier Zhou Enlai good health. The entire city of Rangoon was filled with an atmosphere of joy and excitement for Sino-Burmese friendship. Wherever the two Premiers went to a shed, the water-sprinkling reached its climax. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and the citizens of Rangoon sprinkled water on each other like members of one big family. Although their clothes were dripping wet, the festive mood between the guests and hosts grew ever higher.

Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage first came to the Arakan Water-Sprinkling shed, where the citizens of Rangoon welcomed him with cheerful songs. The theme of the songs was: Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier U Nu to participate in the Water-Sprinkling Festival; Long live Sino-Burmese friendship; Long live the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At this time, the two Premiers clapped their hands to the rhythm of the songs. After entering the Water-Sprinkling shed, the two Premiers watched a group of young men and a group of girls standing in two rows, sprinkling water on each other. While watching them sprinkle water, Premier U Nu introduced the detailed content of the annual Water-Sprinkling Festival to Premier Zhou Enlai.

After Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Premier U Nu and others watched the young men and girls sprinkling water on each other, people brought them bowls, so that they could also participate in the water-sprinkling together with the citizens of Rangoon. Before long, the guests were soaked from head to toe. At this time, people excitedly whistled and cheered and applauded to express their friendship to the distinguished Chinese guests.

The distinguished Chinese guests toured the streets of Rangoon in an open car and stopped in front of many Water-Sprinkling sheds, where they were warmly welcomed everywhere. Young men and women performed graceful songs and dances in the sheds, on floats, and on the streets. When Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Premier U Nu arrived at the last Water-Sprinkling shed in front of the City Hall, the most spectacular scene appeared. The surrounding streets, every balcony and window of the City Hall and surrounding buildings were packed with people. In the square in front of the City Hall, a group of girls danced the Water-Sprinkling dance. When they approached the distinguished Chinese guests, they sprinkled water from silver bowls on them. Water dripped from Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi's clothes, but more and more people came to sprinkle water on them. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi picked up silver bowls and sprinkled water back on them. Indeed, it was difficult to tell who was the host and who was the guest, they were all integrated into the joyful crowd. The water was sprinkled sometimes like an abundant spring, sometimes like a summer rain, sometimes like a waterfall. This silver flow filled with good neighborly feelings, irrigating the tree of friendship, will bring a greater harvest of friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 16th - Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the other Chinese entourage members, accompanied by Burmese Premier U Nu and others, took a pleasant cruise on the Rangoon River.

Premier U Nu had lunch with the distinguished Chinese guests on a special yacht.

Today is the Burmese New Year. Premier Zhou Enlai toasted Premier U Nu and other Burmese hosts on the boat, congratulating them on the New Year. Premier U Nu replied in Chinese: "Friendship, friendship!"

Today, the weather in Rangoon is clear and sunny. Chinese and Burmese flags fluttered side by side at the Rangoon Wharf. When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi arrived at the wharf, they were welcomed by a group of port administrative officials standing by the roadside. The distinguished Chinese guests rode on a special yacht decorated with colorful decorations. On the yacht, Burmese male and female artists performed music, songs, and dances for them. Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with the artists, expressing his appreciation for their performance.

Friendship permeated the picturesque Rangoon River, where many boats could be seen wandering back and forth on the broad, sun-reflecting river surface. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and others enjoyed the scenery along the river while chatting with Premier U Nu and other Burmese hosts. Accompanying the Chinese guests on the tour were Chief Justice of the Supreme Court U Myint Thein, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sao Kun Kyee, Minister of Finance and Revenue and National Planning Thakin Tin, and Minister of Transport, Post and Telegraph, Maritime Transport and Civil Aviation, Public Works, Housing and Construction Bo Min Gaung, and Burmese Navy Chief of Staff Brigadier General Than Pe. Also accompanying them on the tour were Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang and Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Win. (Attached picture)

    银水灌浇友谊树　宾主同栽睦邻花
    周恩来总理同缅甸人民欢度泼水节
    仰光市民载歌载舞高呼中缅友谊万岁
    据新华社仰光15日电　本社记者于民生报道：周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和随行人员在到达仰光以后的三小时，在缅甸联邦总理吴努陪同下，同仰光市民一起参加了欢乐的缅甸泼水节的庆祝活动。成千上万的仰光市民以最大的热情欢迎周恩来总理和陈毅副总理。在将近三小时的庆祝活动中，欢迎的群众和中国客人们互相泼清水，表示他们的真诚的友谊。
    陪同周恩来总理和陈毅副总理于昨天下午参加泼水节庆祝活动的还有运输部长波木昂、财政部长德钦丁、司法部长吴埃貌和缅甸驻华大使叫温。
    午后不久，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和所有其他的中国客人穿上了缅甸服装和拖鞋。当他们穿着这些缅甸民族服装到达吴努总理的官邸的时候，吴努总理风趣地说，“谁是中国人？谁是缅甸人？”周恩来总理和陈毅副总理说，“我们全都是‘胞波’”。主人和客人对于这个问题和回答都爽朗地笑起来了。
    吴努总理对陈毅副总理说，周恩来总理对于泼水节已经有了丰富的经验。他说这话的意思是，在1955年，中国总理在前往万隆的途中曾经在仰光参加庆祝同一个节日。自从那时以来，万隆精神的影响一直不断地增长，而且赢得愈来愈多的人民的支持。中国和缅甸的友谊，在五项原则和万隆精神的灿烂的光芒照耀和孕育下，已经花朵盛开。周恩来总理再次访问缅甸和参加缅甸的泼水节，这无疑将促进中缅友谊的进一步发展，就像在这个节日所泼的水一样会有助于使花朵盛开。
    在两点四十分，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理，在吴努总理的陪同下，乘着一辆敞篷车参加这个节日活动。这天阳光灿烂，和风拂面，空气清新。在仰光全市建立了许多五彩缤纷的泼水彩棚，在每个彩棚里，都用大桶装着清水，大批群众聚集在彩棚里外。少女们捧着银碗，年青男子拿着各色各样的泼水用具，其中有水桶，喷壶，甚至水龙头游戏，他们都殷切地等候中国贵宾到来。当他们一看到周恩来总理和吴努总理，随即活跃起来。有些人敲锣打鼓，有些人演奏各种乐器，另一些人唱着歌颂中缅友谊的歌子。
    不断听到人们高呼祝贺中缅友谊和祝周恩来总理身体健康的口号。整个仰光市都洋溢着为中缅友谊欢欣鼓舞的情绪。两国总理来到哪一座彩棚，哪里的泼水就达到最高潮。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理同仰光市民像一个大家庭里的成员一样互相泼水。虽然周身的衣服都在滴水，宾主之间节日喜庆的情绪愈来愈高涨。
    周恩来总理和他的随行人员首先来到亚拉干泼水彩棚，在那里，仰光市民以快活的歌声来欢迎他。歌的主题是：欢迎周恩来总理和吴努总理参加泼水节；中缅友谊万岁；和平共处五项原则万岁。这时，两位总理按着歌曲的节拍拍手。在进入泼水彩棚以后，两位总理观看一批年轻男子和一批姑娘站成两行，互相泼水。吴努总理在观看他们泼水的同时，向周恩来总理介绍了一年一度的泼水节的详细内容。
    在周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、吴努总理等人观看青年男子和姑娘们互相泼水以后，有人给他们拿来了碗，让他们也同仰光市民一道参加泼水。不一会儿，客人们从头到脚都泼得湿漉漉的，这时人们兴奋地吹起口哨，齐声欢呼鼓掌来表达他们对中国贵宾的友情。
    中国贵宾乘着敞篷车游览仰光的街道，并且在许多泼水棚前面停下来，到处受到热烈的欢迎。青年男女在彩棚里、在彩车上、在街道上，表演优美的歌舞。当周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和吴努总理到达在市政府前面的最后一个泼水棚的时候，出现了最壮观的场面。在周围的街道上，在市政府大厦和周围其他的大楼的每一个阳台和窗口都挤满了人。在市政府大厦前面的广场上有一群姑娘跳泼水舞，当她们走近中国贵宾的时候，她们把银碗里的水泼向他们。水从周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的衣服上滴下来，但是来的人愈来愈多，都向他们泼水。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理拿起银碗也向他们回泼。的确，很难说出谁是主人，谁是客人，他们都溶合在欢乐的人群中。水泼得有时像一股充沛的泉水，有时像夏天的骤雨，有时像瀑布。这种充满睦邻情感的银色的水流，灌浇在友谊的树上，将带来更大的友谊的丰收。
    新华社仰光16日电　周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和所有其他的中国随行人员，在缅甸总理吴努和其他一些人的陪同下，在仰光河上乘船作了一次愉快的游览。
    吴努总理同中国贵宾们在专用游艇上共进午餐。
    今天是缅甸的新年。周恩来总理在船上向吴努总理和其他的缅甸主人敬酒，祝贺新年。吴努总理用中国话回答说：“友好，友好！”
    今天，仰光天气晴朗。中国国旗和缅甸国旗在仰光码头并排飘扬着。当周恩来总理和陈毅副总理到达码头上时，他们受到了一批站在路旁的港口行政官员的欢迎。中国贵宾们乘一艘装饰得五彩缤纷的专用游艇，在艇上，缅甸男女艺术家们向他们表演音乐、歌唱和舞蹈。周恩来总理同艺术家们握手，表示欣赏他们的表演。
    在风景如画的仰光河上洋溢着友谊，在那里可以看到许多船艇在映着阳光的广阔的河面来回游荡着。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和其他的人一面欣赏沿河的风景，一面同吴努总理和其他的缅甸主人畅谈。陪同中国客人游览的有最高法院首席法官吴敏登、外交部长藻昆卓、财政和税务、国家计划部长德钦丁、运输、邮电、海运和民用航空、公共工程、房屋和建设部长波木昂，缅甸海军参谋长丹佩准将。陪同他们游览的还有中国驻缅甸大使李一氓和缅甸驻中国大使叫温。（附图片）
