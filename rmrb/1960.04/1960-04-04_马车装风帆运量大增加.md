    Horse-drawn carriages fitted with sails greatly increase transport capacity
    The Jinning County Transportation Company in Yunnan Province has equipped all of its four-wheeled horse-drawn carriages with sails, increasing the daily transport volume from 60 tons to 100 tons.

    The structure of the horse-drawn carriage sail is relatively simple. Its shape is the same as that of a wooden boat sail. When in use, simply unfold the cloth sail and insert it onto the horse-drawn carriage. The advantages of adding a sail to a four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage are: First, the carrying capacity of each four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage can be increased from 2.5 tons to 3 tons. Second, it reduces the labor intensity of the driver and the horses pulling the carriage. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    马车装风帆运量大增加
    云南省晋宁县运输公司全部四轮马车已实现风帆化，日运量由六十吨提高到了一百吨。
    马车风帆构造比较简单。它的形状与木船帆相同，使用时，只要把布帆撑开，插在马车上即可。四轮马车加帆的好处是：一、每辆四轮马车，载运量可由二吨半提高到三吨。二、减轻赶车者和拉车马匹劳动强度。　　（据新华社讯）
