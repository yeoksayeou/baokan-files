To the Presidium and all members:

Listening to the reports from Deputy Premier Li Fuchun, Deputy Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and other responsible comrades, has given me profound education and inspiration. The current excellent situation fills us with immense encouragement. I fully support and resolutely implement these guidelines.

As mentioned in the reports of several responsible comrades, in order to successfully realize the 1960 plan, and to accelerate the development of socialist construction, a broad, mass-based technological innovation and revolution movement, closely integrated with production, and gradually realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, is unfolding in a magnificent way. In the first spring of this great decade of the 1960s, the tide of the technological revolution is sweeping through every corner of the country, with overwhelming momentum, advancing a thousand miles a day, and changing rapidly. This movement not only rapidly increases labor productivity, but also continuously improves the communist consciousness and scientific and technological levels of the people. From the perspective of women, we can also fully see and confirm the excellent situation of the vigorous development of the current technological revolution movement. Shanghai women, like women all over the country, have been personally witnessed during this inspection, and have enthusiastically joined this turbulent revolutionary torrent together with the people of the city. More and more women are participating in technological innovation, with greater ambitions, more enthusiasm, higher skills, and more flourishing innovation achievements. In this vigorous revolutionary storm, Shanghai women have undergone leaping changes in production, life, and even their mental outlook. Heroes emerge in large numbers, and red flags form forests.

     The Mobilization of Women Makes
  the Technological Revolution Even More Powerful

The enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of women in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is extremely heartening. In the high tide of this technological revolution movement, Shanghai women, under the leadership and education of the Party, have been mobilized very extensively and deeply. Women on all fronts, from factories to street neighborhoods, from industry to finance and trade, culture and education, science and technology, and all fronts of life and welfare, have joined this great revolutionary movement to conquer backward technology. Whether they are production workers or auxiliary workers, whether they operate machines or assemble and pack by hand, almost all of them have taken action. Veteran female workers innovate, and new apprentices also innovate. Those with culture and technology engage in innovation, and those without culture and technology also engage in innovation. An unprecedented, lively situation has formed, where everyone is engaged in innovation and everyone is using their brains. In this movement, not only are the advanced becoming more advanced, but the backward are catching up with the advanced. Even the most backward "dead corners" are taking action and catching up with the advanced. "Lazy girls" are becoming "skillful girls," "Yue opera fans" are becoming "innovation fans," and many mothers with many children are as active as young lads. In the Shanghai Boiler Factory, among more than 700 female employees, very few participated in technological innovation in the past. Only nine technological innovation proposals were put forward last year. Now, the situation is very different. Before March 8th, 870 innovation proposals were put forward, most of which have been implemented, an increase of 96 times compared to last year. For example, Zhou Lumei, a young female assembly worker at the Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, was a well-known Yue opera fan in the factory. After working the night shift, she would not sleep but would queue up to buy Yue opera tickets. She was dizzy at work and could not do well in production. Now, after getting off work on Saturdays, other workers go home, but she is still rummaging around in the scrap materials. The section chief urged her to go back several times, but she did not leave. She made a light and flexible pair of tweezers overnight, replacing the heavy soldering iron, greatly reducing labor intensity and improving work efficiency. Because the broad masses of women have been mobilized, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has become even more powerful. Many women have become obsessed with innovation. In order to break through a key issue and realize an innovation, they think of solutions while walking, use their brains while eating, and never forget innovation day and night, just like the energy of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958. Many female workers moved their bedding into the factory and stayed in the workshop for days and nights. When they were tired, they washed their faces with cold water, and perked themselves up to work again. Some female workers who were not in good health were also eager to run to the factory. They said, "Everyone is working so hard, how can I sleep peacefully in bed? The workshop changes every day, how can I bear to leave?" They are thus dissolving themselves in the great cause of socialist construction.

Women and male workers innovate together, and the scope of innovation is very broad, with a wide variety of colorful contents. They innovate whatever they do, adopting various simple and easy local methods, innovating in every industry and innovating in everything. From bit-by-bit innovations to the realization of semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation, a "one-stop" process. Yesterday they were still working with hammers and scissors, but today they are happily operating machines for production. In the Huasheng Box Factory, female workers, who accounted for 70% of the total number of workers, worked hard for three days with the male workers to make a revolution. These female workers and male workers, who used to deal only with paper, paste, and brushes, unarmed and ignorant of technology, gave full play to collective wisdom and drew ten designs overnight for roughing machines, box tying machines, pulping machines, paint box machines, etc. The machines were made in three days, sweeping away the heavy, primitive manual operations that accounted for almost 100% of the factory. Innovation projects range from small to large, from low to high, from designing and manufacturing hundreds of tons of ships and large machines to entire production lines. For example, during the "March 8th" period last year, female employees of the Second Product Design Office of the Ninth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building designed a 900-horsepower tugboat in two months. This year, on "March 8th," women not only designed, but also manufactured the equipment themselves. For example, a 200-horsepower tugboat launched by Hudong Shipyard before this year's "March 8th" can tow 2,000 tons of cargo barges. The design and manufacturing were all done by female workers. It took only 20 days to complete the hull assembly work on the slipway, and the quality fully met the standards. In the high-end area, some innovation projects filled the technological gap in the motherland and conquered scientific frontiers. For example, female scientific and technical personnel from the acetone-butanol group of the Microbial Research Department of the Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, successfully tested a new fermentation method, which has significant economic significance. Huang Hua, a female doctor at the Sixth People's Hospital, creatively combined traditional Chinese medicine with physiotherapy and used ultraviolet irradiation on acupoints to treat bronchial asthma, with remarkable curative effects. What is particularly exciting is that many ordinary female workers have also become female heroes who conquer the cutting edge. Difficulties cannot defeat them, and failures cannot scare them. Tang Ying, a female assembly worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, who had just shed her illiteracy hat and had been in the factory for only three years, said heroically, "There is no Jade Emperor in the sky, and no Dragon King in the sea. People can go to heaven and into the sea, so what difficulties cannot be overcome?" She boldly trial-produced a precision impedance bridge that had never been produced in our country, and was determined to trial-produce it successfully within three days. It was with such an indomitable spirit that she fought with perseverance. In the absence of design drawings, reference materials, and cultural technology, hundreds of parts and hundreds of lines were disassembled and assembled, and finally successfully completed the trial production of a cutting-edge product.

   Neighborhood housewives actively participate in social labor,
        Urban people's commune organization has been formed.

Since the Great Leap Forward, housewives in Shanghai's street neighborhoods, under the organization of the neighborhood committees, have taken production as the center, and have also extensively held collective welfare, service undertakings, and cultural and educational undertakings, liberating themselves from the shackles of housework and embarking on the road of common labor and collective life. By the end of 1959, more than 850,000 street residents had participated in various social labor and production organizations, the vast majority of whom were housewives. 240,000 people entered factories to work or become apprentices, and more than 140,000 people went to various provinces and cities across the country to support construction in other places. More than 400,000 people, under the direct leadership of the neighborhood committees, participated in the production organizations of the street neighborhoods, or participated in labor reserve teams, often engaged in auxiliary, seasonal, and shock labor serving large factories and enterprises, and some also participated in basic construction and transportation. Some participated in various collective welfare, social services, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings held by street neighborhoods to serve socialist construction. The neighborhood committees in Shanghai's urban areas have been formed into a basic organization of urban people's communes, which is a unified organizer of the economic, political, and cultural life of the residents of the neighborhood. In the current upsurge of running people's communes in various cities across the country, Shanghai's street neighborhood women are even more enthusiastic. Since February, especially in the recent period, a small number of women who have not yet participated in street neighborhood production labor have signed up to participate. In a short period of time, more than 100,500 housewives in the ten old urban areas have participated in the collective labor production of the neighborhood committees. That is to say, more than 80% of the street neighborhood residents with a certain labor capacity in the city have now been organized, setting off a high tide of running street neighborhood production, running public welfare undertakings, running public canteens, and extensively organizing residents' economic life. A situation has formed where "every family has no idlers, everyone is working, and everything is taken care of." Women who have been bowing down beside stoves for thousands of years have been liberated from the small circles of their families, smiling. Their intelligence and talents are gushing out like spring water. Neighborhood women have also actively participated in the technological innovation movement. Since this year, more than 10,000 technological innovation projects have been realized in neighborhood production and welfare and service undertakings. Not only is innovation being carried out in production, but also in "small things in life" that were not paid attention to in the past, such as cooking and taking care of children. For example, women from the Zhangjiazhai Neighborhood Committee in Jing'an District have carried out more than 400 innovations: cutting vegetables, washing rice, washing dishes, serving porridge, and mopping the floor all have machines. In the nursery, a signaling machine is also installed for babies to urinate. As soon as the light turns on, the nanny knows that the diaper is wet and can immediately change it to a dry diaper, which is beneficial to the child's health. Zhuang Bao'e, a family member of a worker, dared to think and act. With the help of workers, she used waste materials to make an electric washing machine, increasing efficiency by nine times.

      The Process of Technological Innovation is Also
          the Process of Improving Women's Culture

The process of technological innovation is also the process of women improving their culture, technology, and political theory. In order to carry out innovation, they go everywhere to learn from experience and seek treasures, innovating, learning, using, and studying at the same time, rapidly improving their technical level and achieving a double harvest of innovation and technology. Embroidery girls have learned to be machinists, winding girls have learned to be metalworkers, and women who have just been freed from illiteracy understand the principles and applications of ultrasonic waves and electronics. Many female workers are engaged in production lines, mastering the production knowledge of several upstream and downstream processes, becoming multi-skilled and all-rounders. In the process of changing the foot-operated sewing machine to semi-automation, the female workers of the Peace Silk Replication Factory learned to assemble motors themselves. Although the first assembly was reversed and could not be used, they also learned the skills, and the second assembly was successful. Shanghai women deeply understand that learning culture and mastering technology are closely related. They said, "If you want to eat grapes, you must first build a trellis. If you want to wear clothes, you must first spin yarn. If you want to master new technology, you must muster up your energy to learn culture." Therefore, while making a big fuss about technological innovation, they are also making a big fuss about cultural revolution. Ni Haibao, a weaving girl from the No. 9 State Cotton Factory, a national "March 8th Red Banner Bearer," also proposed to reach the level of a full-time engineer in 1962. More than 1,700 female workers in the No. 17 State Cotton Factory, under the slogan of "shedding the illiteracy hat on 'March 8th,' everyone becomes a college student," have been freed from illiteracy in batches and have all entered spare-time schools. More and more women are participating in technical research groups. The technological revolution has also promoted women's study of theory; studying Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, has promoted the technological revolution. Wang Juanjuan, a female worker at the Qiuxin Shipyard, studied "On Contradiction" and understood that machines are rigid and people are flexible. As long as they give play to their subjective initiative, they can create miracles. Therefore, she was determined to conquer the machine, dare to think, dare to do, and boldly create, increasing the speed of the car from 720 revolutions to 2,000 revolutions. This year, in the 25 days of a good start, she completed the annual workload.

The technological innovation movement is constantly developing, and the communist spirit of cooperation is being further promoted. No matter who is who, no matter who is who, "one person is in trouble, and ten thousand people support." In order to realize the production line, there is great cooperation between the upstream and downstream processes. The unity between female workers and between male and female workers has been further strengthened. In order to solve technical difficulties and raw material problems, the exchange of information between factories and the mutual cooperation between factories and street neighborhoods are also more common. Wang Guanzhen, a female worker at the Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory, encountered difficulties in the trial production of the "electron tube inspection instrument," and comrades from 26 units enthusiastically supported her. Female workers in the workshop helped the canteen and nursery to reform tools, and the personnel of the canteen and nursery also proposed "eat meals as soon as they arrive" and "take care of children as soon as they arrive, and can take care of them day and night" to support female workers in innovation. There are countless examples of female workers supporting agricultural technical transformation, going to people's commune-run industries to help manufacture new-style agricultural implements and agricultural machinery, and supporting innovation in street neighborhood collective life welfare and service undertakings. In particular, great cooperation among family members has become a new trend. They mobilize their fathers and brothers to help design, find their husbands to cooperate in drawing, and some underage children also come to help their mothers with innovation models and drawings. Old mothers take care of their daughters' children, and fathers-in-law send bedding to their daughters-in-law. There is no end to the touching stories. The technological innovation movement has added a new scene of mutual assistance, unity, friendship, and happiness to the family.

     Women's Power is Limitless
       Holding Up Half the Sky of Production

Since the Great Leap Forward, Shanghai women, under the leadership of the Party, have made brilliant and outstanding achievements. Therefore, people say, "Women's power is boundless, holding up half the sky of the great cause." This evaluation gives us women great encouragement. Indeed, women have become an indispensable force on all fronts; similarly, they are also a vital force in the technological revolution movement. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao once said, "Chinese women are a great human resource." We have once again seen from the technological revolution movement that this resource contains unlimited intelligence and talent, which is truly inexhaustible.

What power enables the broad masses of women to actively participate in the technological revolution movement and make such outstanding achievements?

All the achievements of women are due to the correct leadership of the Party, the teachings of Mao Zedong Thought, and the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, which have promoted the great liberation of women's thoughts and the great liberation of labor force. At the same time, the technological revolution is also the urgent demand of women themselves. Women who have already turned over politically and economically further hope to be liberated from heavy physical labor, to seek a second liberation, and to no longer be restricted by physiology and physical strength, so that their energy and wisdom can be used more effectively. They deeply realize that only by rapidly changing the backward face of our country, building a strong socialist country, can women have a happier and better life, only when class society no longer exists, and heavy physical labor is automated, can true equality between men and women be realized, and only when communist society is realized, can women be completely liberated.

This meeting, listening to the reports of responsible comrades and the speeches of all members, has broadened my thinking even more. Under the current excellent situation, I will resolutely listen to the Party, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, continue to exert all my energy, strive for the upstream, earnestly implement the General Line, and bravely advance to realize the continued, comprehensive, and better leap forward of the national economy this year.

专栏：

    广大妇女投入技术革命洪流
    沈粹缜委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席等负责同志的报告，给了我深刻的教育和启发，当前的大好形势，使我们感到莫大鼓舞。我完全拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    正如几位负责同志报告中所讲的，为了胜利地实现1960年规划，为了加速社会主义建设事业的发展，一个与生产密切结合，逐步实现机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化为中心的广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在波澜壮阔的开展起来。在这个伟大的六十年代的第一个春天，技术革命的浪潮席卷全国每一个角落，排山倒海，气势磅礴，一日千里，瞬息万变。这个运动不仅迅速提高劳动生产率，而且人民群众共产主义觉悟，科学技术水平也在不断提高。从妇女这方面的情况，也完全可以看到，证实当前技术革命运动蓬勃发展的大好形势。上海妇女和全国各地妇女一样，在这次视察中，我亲眼看到上海妇女和全市人民一起热火朝天地卷入了这个波涛汹涌的革命洪流。参加技术革新的妇女愈来愈多，雄心愈来愈大，干劲愈来愈足，本领愈练愈高，革新的花朵愈开愈盛。在这场轰轰烈烈的革命风暴里，上海妇女在生产上、生活上，以至精神面貌，又起了飞跃的变化，英雄辈出，红旗成林。
          妇女群众的发动使
      技术革命运动声势更为浩大
    广大妇女群众热情奔放地投入技术革新、技术革命运动是十分振奋人心的。上海妇女在这次技术革命运动高潮里，在党的领导教育下，非常广泛深入的发动起来了。各条战线上的妇女，从工厂到街道里弄，从工业到财贸、文教、科技、生活福利各条战线，都投入了这个征服落后技术的伟大革命运动。无论生产工人或辅助工人，无论机器操作的或手工装装配配、包包扎扎的，几乎全部行动起来。老年女工革新，新艺徒也革新，有文化技术的搞革新，没有文化技术的也搞革新。形成了人人闹革新，个个动脑筋的空前未有的热气腾腾的局面。在这场运动中，不但先进的更先进，后进的赶上先进，连最落后的“死角”也行动起来，纷纷赶上先进。“懒姑娘”变成“巧姑娘”，“越剧迷”变成“革新迷”，许多多子女的妈妈和年轻的小伙子一样活跃。上海锅炉厂七百多女职工，过去参加技术革新的很少，去年一年只提了九条技术革新建议。现在，情况大不相同了，“三八”前就提出革新建议八百七十条，大部分均已实现。比去年一年增加九十六倍。又如上海电表厂青年装配女工周侣梅，是全厂闻名的越剧迷，做了夜班以后，觉也不睡，就去排队买越剧票，上班时昏冬冬的，搞不好生产。现在，星期六下班后，别的工人都回家了，她还在废料里东摸西找。工段长几次催她回去，她也不走，连夜做成了轻便灵巧的镊子钳，代替了笨重的电烙铁，大大减轻了劳动强度，提高了工作效率。由于广大妇女群众发动起来，使技术革新、技术革命群众运动声势更为浩大。许多妇女革新成迷，为了攻破一个关键，实现一项革新，她们走路想办法，吃饭动脑筋，日日夜夜不忘革新。像1958年大炼钢铁时那样的劲头。不少女工把铺盖搬进了工厂，几天几夜不离车间，倦了时用冷水洗洗脸，振作了精神再干。有些身体不大好的女工也急着跑到厂里来。她们说：“大家这样干，我怎能安心睡在床上？车间里一天变一个样，我怎么舍得离开？”她们就是这样的把自己溶化在伟大的社会主义建设事业之中。
    妇女和男工一起闹革新，革新的面很广，内容五花八门，丰富多彩。她们做什么，就革什么。采取各种简而易举的土办法，行行革新，事事革新。从一点一滴的革新到实现半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化，“一条龙”。昨天还是手拿鎯头、剪刀干活的，今天已经欢天喜地的操纵机器生产。华生制盒厂占工人总数70％的女工，和男工一起，苦战三天革个命。这些过去只和纸版、浆糊、刷帚打交道，手无寸铁，不懂技术的女工和男工，发挥了集体智慧，一夜里画好了搓坯机、扎盒机、打浆机、漆盒机等十个图样。三天做出了机器，把几乎占全厂百分之百的笨重的原始的手工操作一扫而光。革新项目从小到大，从低到高。大到设计、制造几百吨轮船、大型机器，以至整条的生产线。如去年“三八”时，第一机械工业部九局第二产品设计室女职工在两个月里设计了一艘九百匹马力的拖轮。今年“三八”，妇女们不但自己设计，而且亲自动手制造。如沪东造船厂在今年“三八”节前下水的一艘二百匹马力拖轮，能拖带二千吨货驳。从设计到制造都由女工担任。仅以二十天的时间就完成了船台上船体装配工作，质量完全符合标准。在高尖方面，有些革新项目填补了祖国技术空白，攻下科学尖端。如中国科学院植物生理研究所微生物组丙酮丁醇小组的女科技人员试验成功新的发酵方法，具有重大的经济意义。第六人民医院女医师黄桦，创造性的运用祖国医学与理疗相结合，采用紫外线照穴位治疗支气管哮喘，疗效显著，尤其令人兴奋的是：不少普通女工也成了攻尖端的女英雄。困难难不倒她们，失败吓不倒她们。像沪光科学仪器厂刚摘掉文盲帽子、进厂不过三年多的装配女工唐英豪迈地说：“天上没有玉皇，海里没有龙王，人能上天下海，有什么困难不能克服？”她大胆试制我国从来未生产过的精密阻抗电桥，一定要在三天之内试制成功。就是以这样不成功誓不罢休的气概，百折不挠的顽强精神战斗。在没有设计图纸，没有参考材料，没有文化技术的困难情况下，几百种零件，几百条线路，拆了又装，装了又拆，终于胜利地完成了一项尖端产品的试制工作。
    里弄家庭妇女积极参加社会劳动
      城市人民公社组织已经形成
    大跃进以来，上海街道里弄家庭妇女，在里弄委员会组织下，以生产为中心，同时大量举办集体福利、服务事业和文化教育事业，从家务的束缚中解放出来，走上共同劳动，集体生活的道路。到1959年底，已经参加各项社会劳动和生产组织的街道居民有八十五万多人。其中绝大多数是家庭妇女。二十四万人进了工厂做工或当艺徒，十四万多人到全国各省市支援外地建设。四十多万人在里弄委员会的直接领导下，有的参加了街道里弄的生产组织，有的参加劳动预备队，经常从事为大工厂企业服务的辅助性、季节性、突击性的劳动，有的还参加基本建设、交通运输等劳动。有的参加街道里弄举办的各种集体福利和社会服务以及文教卫生事业，为社会主义建设服务。上海市区的里弄委员会已经形成为城市人民公社的一种基础组织，是里弄居民经济生活、政治生活和文化生活的统一组织者。在当前全国各城市大办人民公社的热潮中，上海街道里弄妇女更是热情高涨。2月份以来，特别是最近一个时期，少数尚未参加街道里弄生产劳动的妇女纷纷报名要求参加，短短的时间里，十个老市区又有十万零五千多家庭妇女参加了里弄委员会的集体劳动生产。就是说，现在全市有一定劳动能力的街道里弄居民80％以上已经组织起来。掀起了大办街道里弄生产、大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛组织居民经济生活的高潮。形成了“家家无闲人，人人都劳动，事事有人管”的局面。几千年来屈服在锅灶旁的妇女，从家庭小圈子里解放出来，笑逐颜开。她们的聪明才干像泉水一样的喷涌出来。里弄妇女同样积极地投入了技术革新运动。今年以来，里弄生产和福利、服务事业中实现的技术革新项目已有一万多条。不但在生产上闹革新，烧饭、带孩子等过去不被人注意的“生活小事”也闹革新。例如静安区张家宅里弄委员会妇女搞成了四百多项革新：切菜、淘米、洗碗、盛粥、拖地板等样样都有了机器。托儿所里为婴儿撒尿也装上报讯机，只要灯光一亮，阿姨就知道尿布湿了，可以立即换上干尿布，有利于孩子健康。职工家属庄宝娥敢想敢做，在工人帮助下，利用废料制成电动洗衣机，提高效率九倍。
          技术革新过程也是
          提高妇女文化过程
    技术革新的过程也是妇女提高文化技术和政治理论的过程。为了搞革新，她们到处取经觅宝、边革、边学、边用、边钻，迅速地提高技术水平，获得革新、技术双丰收。绣花姑娘学会当机匠，绕线女工学会当金工，刚脱盲的妇女懂得了超声波、电子的原理和应用。许多女工大搞生产流水线，掌握了上下几道工序的生产知识，成多面手、全把式。和平丝绸复制厂的女工在改变脚踏缝纫机为半自动化的过程中，自己学习装配马达，虽然第一次装反了，不能使用，却也学到了本领，第二次就装配成功。上海妇女深刻体会学习文化和掌握技术有密切关系，她们说：“要吃葡萄先搭架，要穿衣服先纺纱，要想掌握新技术，鼓起劲来学文化。”因此在大闹技术革新时，又大闹文化革命。全国“三八红旗手”国棉九厂织布女工倪海宝，还提出要在1962年达到专职工程师的水平。国棉十七厂一千七百多个女工在“‘三八’脱掉文盲帽，人人都做大学生”的口号下，已经分批脱盲，并百分之百的进入了业余学校。愈来愈多的妇女参加技术研究小组。技术革命也推动了妇女学理论；学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想为武器，又推动了技术革命。求新造船厂女工王娟娟学习了“矛盾论”，明白了机器是呆的，人是活的，只要发挥主观能动作用，就能创造奇迹的道理。因此她决心治服机器，敢想、敢做，大胆创造，把车速由七百二十转提高二千转。今年在开门红的二十五天就完成了全年的工作量。
    技术革新运动不断发展，共产主义协作精神更为发扬。不分你我，不论彼此，“一人困难，万人支援。”为了实现生产流水线，上下几道工序大协作。女工之间，男女工之间的团结进一步加强了。为了解决技术上的困难、原材料问题，工厂与工厂之间互通有无，工厂与街道里弄之间相互协作的情况也更普遍了。关勒铭金笔厂女工王关珍在试制“电子管检验仪”的过程中，碰到困难，有二十六个单位同志纷纷热情支援。车间女工帮助食堂托儿所搞工具改革，食堂、托儿所人员也提出“饭随到随吃”
  “孩子随到随托，日夜可托”，支持女工搞革新。女工支援农业技术改造，到人民公社社办工业帮助制造新式农具、农业机械，支援里弄集体生活福利、服务事业革新更是不胜枚举。特别是家庭成员大协作成了新风气，动员父亲、哥哥帮助设计，找了丈夫协作画图，有的尚未成年的子女也来帮助母亲搞革新模型、图样，老母亲为女儿带孩子，老公公为媳妇送铺盖，动人的事例说不完。技术革新运动，使家庭增添了互助、团结、友爱、幸福的新景象。
          妇女力量大无边
            顶住生产半边天
    大跃进以来，上海妇女在党的领导下，做出了辉煌卓越的成绩。因此，人们都说：“妇女力量大无边，顶住伟大事业的半边天。”这个估价，给我们妇女极大的鼓舞。的确，妇女在各条战线上，已成为一支不可缺少的力量；同样的，也是技术革命运动中的一支生力军。我们敬爱的领袖毛主席早就说过：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。”我们从技术革命运动中，再一次地看到这种资源蕴藏着无限聪明才干，真是取之不尽，用之不竭。
    是什么力量使广大妇女群众积极投入技术革命运动，并能做出这样出色的成绩呢？
    妇女的一切成绩，是党的正确领导，是毛泽东思想的教导，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝促使妇女思想大解放、劳动力大解放。同时，技术革命也是妇女本身的迫切要求，在政治上、经济上已经翻了身的妇女，进一步希望从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，求得第二次解放，不再受生理和体力的限制，让她们的干劲和智慧更有用武之地。她们深刻的体会到，只有迅速改变我国一穷二白的落后面貌，建设强大的社会主义国家，妇女才能有更幸福、更美好的生活，只有阶级社会不存在了，笨重体力劳动都自动化了，才能真正实现男女平等，只有实现共产主义社会，妇女才能得到彻底解放。
    这次会议，听了负责同志的报告，各位委员的发言，使我的思想更开阔了。在当前大好形势下，我坚决听党的话，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，认真贯彻执行总路线，为实现今年国民经济继续全面的更好的跃进，奋勇前进。
