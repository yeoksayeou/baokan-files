I warmly support the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. These two reports present us with a magnificent picture of 600 million people continuing to leap forward. This picture encourages the people of the whole country to love the Party and Chairman Mao even more, to love socialism, and to make great ambitions, work hard, and strive for new and greater victories for the bright future of our great motherland.

I also warmly support the “Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference” made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. This report points out that in this rapidly developing situation, we must actively participate in the mass movement of technological revolution, enthusiastically serve socialist construction, and at the same time, we should earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought in this great movement, transform ourselves, improve our awareness, and become a red and expert intellectual of the working class.

The current situation is truly infinitely beautiful. The Party's General Line has formed a huge force, and the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement, which began in 1958, have greatly accelerated China's socialist construction. The main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan have been achieved three years ahead of schedule. The National Agricultural Development Program for Twelve Years will also be realized ahead of schedule as a result. The fact that the output targets of major industrial products will catch up with and surpass those of Britain within ten years will certainly be achieved much earlier. Of course, we who are engaged in cultural, educational, and scientific work also have great ambitions to make an early achievement: to realize the long-term plan for the development of science and technology in twelve years ahead of schedule, and to climb the peak of world science faster.

We started late on the scientific track. The task of catching up with the world level is arduous, but also very glorious. The central issue is to advance at high speed. We must use unprecedented high speed to realize this ambitious goal. The leadership of the Party, and the General Line put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao are the best guarantees of this high speed. In the past two years, China's cultural, educational, and scientific front has already achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. We who are engaged in cultural, educational, and scientific work have contributed to this Great Leap Forward and have also achieved certain transformations and progress because we listen to the Party, follow the path of being both red and expert, and actively participate in the mass movements of education revolution and technological revolution. Of course, these are only the beginning. All progress and gains on the road ahead are only the beginning of new and greater progress for us. We should work hard and continue to move forward at a faster pace.

Life and practice teach us that we must change erroneous viewpoints and working methods.

My job is at Dalian Institute of Technology. Like all colleges and universities in the country, it has undergone profound development and changes in the past two years due to the implementation of the Party's education policy, the combination of Party leadership and the mass line, and the vigorous launch of mass movements. It has developed from the original dozen or so majors to nearly forty majors, and young teachers have grown up in large numbers like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The combination of teaching work with production practice and scientific research is becoming closer and more natural day by day. Recently, through revolutionary methods of the mass line such as teaching performance competitions and teacher-student teaching research conferences, a large-scale harvest of teaching quality has appeared. Teachers and students in batches go to factories and construction sites to participate in technological revolution and technological innovation movements, and their enthusiasm is very high. They have obtained extremely rich production knowledge from practice, which is reflected in the effect of classroom learning in schools. The content of the courses is richer and more vivid, and the class hours of the courses are shortened instead. In particular, the content that used to take a semester to teach in professional courses can now be taught in a much shorter time. It can be seen that more, faster, better, and more economical are completely unified. Mass scientific research work has also been vigorously launched in schools, with a team of more than 1,000 teachers and students regularly engaged in research work in various aspects of production and construction, basic theory, and cutting-edge science. All this is the victory of the Party's education policy and the victory of the Party's General Line.

Life and practice are the best educators, teaching us that we must change our erroneous viewpoints and working methods. For example, in the old society in the past, we studied and researched alone. The knowledge that could be obtained in this way was extremely limited, but it developed a very bad working habit in us: working alone. Therefore, for many years, we have not been able to learn to follow the mass line well in our work. We do not recognize the greatness of collective strength, and we do not understand that everything must rely on the masses. This makes us believe only in personal efforts and roles in everything, and we are so busy that we are overwhelmed. As a result, we are doing less, slower, worse, and wasting money. The problem is not just the good or bad of working habits. The consequences of individualism that grows from this are even more unspeakable. The rapid changes in the surrounding things in the past few years have profoundly educated me and gradually made me understand the great role of the Party's mass line. I understand that only by placing the individual in the collective can the individual's role be most effectively exerted. I understand that only through constantly revolutionary mass movements to carry out education revolution and march towards science can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical, and can we achieve the high speed we need. Socialist construction is indeed complicated, and the work of each of us is indeed very busy. In the past, I always felt that there was not enough time, and this contradiction was really difficult to solve. I once thought that there were too many meetings and too frequent movements, which delayed too much time. It was believed that since time was tight, everyone should seize some time, hold fewer meetings, and engage in fewer movements as a way to save time. This view and method of handling problems is naturally wrong. The root of the error lies in seeing work and time as merely personal, without seeing that individual work is only a very small component of the revolutionary collective cause, and that the revolutionary collective cause must rely on collective strength to complete. Seeing only personal roles and relying solely on personal efforts will lead to getting lost. Even if the direction is roughly correct, at most two days' work can be done in one day, and it is also impossible to sustain it. How does the Party lead the masses to fight against time? That is to resolutely rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, grasp the development of the objective situation, and constantly launch mass movements time and time again. What is the effect? The Great Leap Forward situation of "one day equals twenty years" has appeared and will continue. The masses have become the masters of time. Today, we say with conviction that only mass movements can most fully exert the great strength of hundreds of millions of people, and only in mass movements can the efforts of each person play the greatest role. Attending meetings, whether long or short, and engaging in movements, whether large or small, seems like a waste of time from an individual point of view; from a collective point of view, this is to save time and fight against time. The same contradiction—the contradiction of time—two different standpoints, the methods and ways of solving it are completely different, and the effects are so different. It can be seen that there is an inseparable relationship between standpoint, viewpoint, and method. If the standpoint changes, the viewpoint of looking at problems and the method of handling problems will also change. There are contradictions everywhere in life and work. How can we correctly handle various contradictions? How can we conform to objective laws and conform to the socialist direction? Facts teach us that only by establishing a materialist dialectical proletarian worldview and thoroughly transforming our standpoint can we do this. For this, earnestly studying Mao Zedong Thought is of decisive significance.

Keep up with the development of the situation and advance at high speed. Aspire to be a proletarian fighter.

At present, the situation of the socialist revolution is developing very rapidly. In order to keep up with the situation, correct ideological weapons are particularly important. What is advanced today will raise the standard for measuring advancement tomorrow. We must continue to move forward and continue to make revolution in order to remain advanced. Therefore, we must "look up" to the situation. Looking up can make us improve every day, boost our energy, and strive to be upstream. Looking up can make us understand that upstream is not fixed, but constantly moving forward. People's subjective thinking often lags behind the development of the objective situation. If we want to leap forward, we must understand the changes in the objective situation and use all the favorable conditions and possibilities that have already appeared objectively in order to most effectively exert our subjective initiative and enthusiasm.

Needless to say, studying the great Mao Zedong Thought is also of paramount importance for our specific scientific research work. Modern science has developed to such an extent that the relationship between science and production is becoming closer and more complex. New problems and new growth points are constantly emerging. Breaking through a key point may drive a large area. But if we cannot grasp the key and cannot see the main contradiction clearly, we will inevitably feel that scientific problems are so thorny, making people feel at a loss and unable to start. In order to be sensitive to new things and new phenomena, to learn to actively grasp contradictions, and thus solve contradictions, we must have a materialist dialectical way of thinking, and Mao Zedong Thought is the most thorough materialist dialectical thought. Precisely because of this, the General Line and related set of policies formulated by the Party have enabled China's socialist construction cause to develop rapidly along the correct track. The scientific cause is no exception. Under the leadership of the Party, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the principle of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, resolutely following the mass line, and vigorously launching mass movements, the scientific cause will surely be able to advance at high speed.

The current upsurge of socialist construction is magnificent. We live in the Mao Zedong era, which is the most meaningful and happiest. After these years of training and ideological transformation, we have gained some understanding and progress, but there are still many problems that need to be further strengthened to keep up with the situation, advance at high speed, and aspire to be a red and expert proletarian fighter and contribute all our strength to socialism.

    做又红又专的知识分子
    钱令希委员的发言
    我热烈拥护李富春副总理所作“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。这两个报告把一幅宏伟壮丽的六亿人民继续跃进的巨画展示在我们面前。这幅巨画鼓舞着全国人民更加热爱党和毛主席，热爱社会主义，为伟大祖国光明灿烂的未来，立大志，鼓干劲，去争取新的更大的胜利。
    我也热烈拥护陈叔通副主席所作“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。这个报告指出我们在这飞跃发展的形势中必须积极投入技术革命的群众运动中去，热情奔放地为社会主义建设服务，同时，应当在这个伟大的运动中认真学习毛泽东思想，改造自己，提高觉悟，做一个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    当前形势，真是无限美好。党的总路线已经形成巨大的力量，1958年开始的大跃进和人民公社运动极大地加速了我国社会主义建设。第二个五年计划各项主要指标已经提前三年实现了。十二年全国农业发展纲要也将因此提前实现。各项主要工业的产品产量指标在十年内赶上并超过英国的事实眼看一定也会大大提前实现。当然，我们从事文教科学工作者也有雄心大志来一个提前：提前实现十二年科学技术发展远景规划，更快地攀登世界科学高峰。
    我们在科学跑道上，起步是落后了。追赶世界水平的任务是艰巨的，也是十分光荣的。中心问题是要高速度前进。必须用史无前例的高速度才能实现这个雄心大志。党的领导，党和毛主席提出的总路线是这个高速度的最好保证。在过去两年中，我国文教科学战线上，已经获得空前的大跃进。我们从事文教科学的工作者，由于听党的话，走又红又专的道路，并积极投身于教育革命和技术革命的群众运动中去，所以为这个大跃进贡献了力量，同时自己也获得了一定的改造和进步。当然，这些都只是开始。前进道路上的一切进展和收获，对我们来说，都只不过是新的更大的进展的开始，还应该奋发努力，继续用更快的速度前进。
    生活和实际教育我们必须改变错误观点和工作方法
    我的工作岗位是大连工学院。它和全国各高等院校一样，这两年由于贯彻了党的教育方针，党的领导和群众路线相结合，大搞群众运动，学校的面貌有了深刻的发展和变化。从原来的十几个专业发展到将近四十个专业，青年师资如雨后春笋地成片成长。教学工作与生产实践、科学研究的结合一天天地更紧密、更自然。最近通过教学表演赛和师生教学研究会等群众路线的革命方法，教学质量出现了大面积丰收的现象。教师和同学们分批下工厂、下工地参加技术革命和技术革新运动，情绪十分高涨，从实践中获得极为丰富的生产知识，反映在学校中课堂学习的效果是课程内容更充实和生动了，而课程的学时却相反地缩短了；特别是专业课程，以前要一个学期讲完的内容，现在可以用短得相当多的时间便讲完了，可见多快和好省是完全可以统一的。群众性的科学研究工作在学校里也已蓬勃展开，经常有一千多名的师生队伍从事各种生产建设方面的、基础理论方面的和尖端科学方面的研究工作。这一切是党的教育方针的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利。
    生活和实际是最能教育人的，教育我们必须改变自己错误的观点和工作方法。举个例子，在过去旧社会里，我们读书研究，总是单枪匹马，用这种方式所能获得的知识固然是极其有限，但是却让我们养成一种很坏的工作习惯：单干。因此多年来不能很好地在工作中学会走群众路线。不认识集体力量的伟大，不懂得万事必须依靠群众。这样便让我们事事只相信个人的努力和作用，忙得焦头烂额，结果是少、慢、差、费。问题还不止是工作习惯的好坏，由此而滋长的个人主义，其恶果更是一言难尽。这几年周围事物发生的突飞猛进的变化深刻地教育了我，逐渐使我懂得党的群众路线的伟大的作用。懂得只有把个人放在集体之中，才能最有效地发挥个人的作用。懂得只有通过不断革命的群众运动搞教育革命和向科学进军，才能多快好省，才能出现我们需要的高速度。社会主义建设确是千头万绪，我们每个人的工作也确是十分繁忙，以前总是觉得时间不够，这个矛盾实在不好解决。曾经认为开会太多了，运动太频繁了，这太耽误工夫。认为时间既然紧，每个人应该抓紧些时间，少开些会，少搞些运动是节省时间的方法。这种观点和处理问题的方法自然是错误的。错误的根本在于把工作和时间看成只是个人的，而没有看到个人工作只是革命集体事业的一个极小组成部分，而革命集体事业是必须依靠集体力量来完成的。只看到个人作用，单凭个人努力会迷失方向。即使方向大致不错，也至多一天做两天的工作，并且也是无法持久的。党是怎样来领导群众和时间作斗争的呢？那就是坚决依靠群众，发动群众，掌握客观形势的发展，一次一次地不断大搞群众运动。效果如何呢？“一天等于二十年”的大跃进局面出现了，并且将持续下去。群众做了时间的主人。我们今天心悦诚服地说唯有群众运动才能最充分地发挥亿万人民这样伟大的力量，而每个人的努力也唯有在群众运动中才能起到最大的作用。开会不论是长短，运动不论是大小，从个人出发，好像是浪费时间；从集体出发，这却是为了争取时间，向时间作斗争。同一个矛盾——时间的矛盾，两种立场，解决的方法和途径迥然不同，效果也如此悬殊。可见立场、观点和方法之间有着不可分割的关系。立场改变了，看问题的观点、处理问题的方法也会改变。生活与工作，在在都有矛盾存在，怎样才能正确处理各种各样的矛盾呢？才能符合客观规律和符合社会主义方向呢？事实教育我们，只有建立唯物辩证的无产阶级世界观，彻底改造我们的立场，为此，认真学习毛泽东思想是有决定性意义的。
    跟上形势的发展高速前进  立志做一名无产阶级战士
    当前，社会主义革命形势发展得非常快，要跟上形势，正确的思想武器显得特别重要。今天是先进的事物，明天用以衡量先进的标准将上涨，就必须不断前进，不断革命才能保持先进。因此对于形势，一定要“看涨”。看涨便能使我们天天向上，鼓足干劲，力争上游。看涨才能使我们了解上游并不是固定，而是不断向前运动的。人们主观思想往往落后于客观形势的发展。我们要跃进，就必须认识客观形势的变化，利用客观已经出现的一切有利条件和可能性，才能最有效地发挥我们的主观能动性和积极性。
    用不着说，学习伟大的毛泽东思想，对于我们从事的具体科学研究工作也是头等重要的。近代科学已经发展到这样境地，科学与生产的关系，越紧密，关系也越错综复杂。新的问题，新的生长点不断出现。突破关键性的一点，便有可能带动一大片。但是如果抓不住关键，看不清主要矛盾，就不免感到科学问题如此棘手，令人漫无头绪，无从下手。要对于新事物新现象敏感，要学会主动掌握矛盾，从而解决矛盾，就必须具有唯物辩证的思想方法，而毛泽东思想是最彻底的唯物辩证主义思想。正因为如此，党制定的总路线和有关的一套方针，使我国社会主义建设事业沿着正确的轨道突飞猛进地向前发展。科学事业绝不例外，在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持不断革命和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，坚决走群众路线，大搞群众运动，科学事业就一定能够高速度前进。
    当前社会主义建设高潮，波澜壮阔，我们生活在毛泽东时代，最有意义，也最为幸福。经过这几年的锻炼和思想改造，有了些认识和进步，但是问题还不少，必需进一步加强改造，跟上形势，高速前进，立志做一名又红又专的无产阶级战士，为社会主义贡献一切力量。
