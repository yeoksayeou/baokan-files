Comrades,

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I will resolutely implement them. Now, I will make the following speech on the issue of comprehensively organizing people's lives with the public canteen as the center.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of Hebei Province, on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958 and 1959, are continuing to leap forward this year. Currently, a vigorous mass movement for large-scale high yields of one thousand catties of grain, one hundred catties of cotton, and ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes per mu is underway in the rural areas of the province. Thanks to the good work done in accumulating fertilizer, water conservancy, and field management last winter, the wheat is generally growing well this year. In the cities, the broad masses of workers are deeply engaged in a production increase and economy practice campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. The major industrial production plans for the first quarter have been overfulfilled. All aspects of the situation indicate that 1960 will continue to be a year of high-speed, sustained Great Leap Forward.

With the continuous leap forward in socialist construction and the consolidation and development of urban and rural people's communes, the demand for labor in all areas has increased sharply. The originally idle labor force in society has generally found employment, and a large number of housewives have joined production and construction. Thus, the living problems of individual families have increasingly become social problems, and the socialization of housework has become an inevitable trend. The broad masses of people urgently demand that the Party and the government lead them to organize and manage their lives well. Therefore, comprehensively managing people's lives well has become a new and significant task in socialist construction.

Caring about developing production and caring about people's lives are our Party's consistent policy and glorious tradition. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have constantly instructed us from the very beginning that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care about their lives and pay attention to grasping ideology, production, and life comprehensively. The Party and government leaders at all levels in Hebei Province have conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's policy and Chairman Mao's instructions.

In comprehensively organizing people's lives, we have realized that the primary issue is to solve the problem of feeding tens of millions of people. That is, first of all, to solve the grain problem and run public canteens well. Hebei Province has always been a grain-deficient province. In the past few years, the Central Government had to transfer hundreds of millions to billions of catties of grain to us from fraternal provinces every year. Therefore, we are determined to solve this problem. After several years of struggle, agricultural production has made considerable progress, especially in the past two years. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has been even higher, and the Great Leap Forward has continued for two years, finally achieving basic grain self-sufficiency in the province. This must be said to be a significant victory of historical significance for our province. Of course, the current grain situation in our province is still not abundant, and we must continue to increase grain production in every possible way. We regard developing agricultural production, especially increasing grain production, as the central task of the province.

		In the countryside

The public canteens in the rural areas of Hebei Province developed in large numbers during the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958. Like other new things, they went through a tortuous development process, and now they have embarked on a path of consolidation, soundness, and development. At present, there are more than 210,000 canteens in the rural areas of the province, and the number of people participating in the canteens accounts for 92% of the total rural population. Among these canteens, those that are well-run and relatively well-run account for more than 80%, and more than 23,000 of them are particularly outstanding. These well-run canteens have not only become socialist families inseparable from the lives of the commune members, but also have become the central places for the political, economic, and cultural activities of the commune members. The canteen of the Dongziyan Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Xinle is a typical example.

The canteen of the Dongziyan Production Team was consciously established by the masses during the Great Leap Forward in the spring of 1958. After two years of development, it has reached a relatively sound level. They have achieved eating enough, eating well, and eating economically. The canteen's meals change their patterns according to the farming season, with cold and hot dishes, dry and liquid foods, vegetables and soups, and can be different for several days. Special arrangements and care are provided for different commune members and special problems, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, postpartum women, weddings and funerals, illnesses, festivals, and visits from relatives and friends. They carried out a technological innovation and revolution movement in rice and flour processing, cooking utensils, and cooking techniques, and created "one animal four mills," gear-driven fast grinding, homemade tap water, vegetable cutting machines, universal stoves, and so on, achieving semi-mechanization. Of the more than 1,580 people in the village who participated in the canteen, 164 people were originally used for rice and flour processing and cooking. After the development of technological innovation, only 38 people are now used, saving more than three times the labor force. Compared with before the establishment of the canteen, even more labor is saved. At the same time, the labor intensity of the cooks has been reduced, and the quality of the food has been improved. It has achieved "turning coarse grains into fine grains, dead dough into live dough, eating potatoes without seeing potatoes, and eating vegetables into fillings." Not only is life well-managed, but more than 80,000 catties of grain were saved last year. What should be mentioned in particular is that because the canteen operated sideline production such as vegetable gardens, pig raising, and flour production, it achieved self-sufficiency in oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables. In addition, the distribution of the production team implemented a ration supply system, which guaranteed that commune members did not have to pay for meals. Therefore, the canteen was warmly supported by the commune members. They wrote hundreds of poems to praise the canteen, saying: "The commune is like a red sun, the sun comes out and shines on the canteen, the canteen skillfully cooks thousands of meals, the meals are good and the vegetables are fragrant and the heart is comfortable." Because life is well-managed, the commune members' enthusiasm for production is very high, and a large number of laborers are liberated to invest in production, and the attendance rate and labor productivity are constantly improved. This village was originally very poor, and the grain was not enough to eat for years, living a life of bran and vegetable for half a year. In the past, the state had to supply 100,000 to 200,000 catties of grain every year. In the past two years, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, people's communes have been established, canteens have been set up, and production has grown at a high speed. In 1958, it changed from a grain-deficient village to a surplus grain village, selling more than 180,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. In 1959, the Great Leap Forward continued, selling more than 310,000 catties of surplus grain. In addition to various consumption grains and seeds, there are also more than 150,000 catties of grain in reserve (an average of nearly 100 catties per person). At the same time, with the development of the collectivization of production and the socialization of housework, the people's ideological outlook has undergone profound changes, and the communist spirit has been highly developed. After returning from the fields, the commune members consciously help the cooks to cook and sweep the floor. The cooks make good noodle soup and meals for the sick commune members and send them to their homes, asking about their health. Everyone is like living in a big family, united and friendly, sharing weal and woe, respecting the old and caring for the young, and helping each other. In particular, the broad masses of women have not only been liberated economically and in life, but also ideologically, keeping pace with men and becoming an important force in production and construction. Many women wrote poems praising the canteen, saying: "The whole people run the canteen, women are truly liberated, men and women go to the fields together, go to the canteen together, the whole village becomes one family, and the heart is filled with joy." All of these fully demonstrate the superiority of the public canteen and the superiority of the socialist mode of production and life. The public canteen has become an important position for consolidating the people's commune. Naturally, the example I have given is one of the best-run canteens. However, there are already not a few such canteens in the province, but thousands. Therefore, even if a few people still doubt, disapprove of, or even oppose the public canteen, the public canteen has finally grown up in accordance with the principle of actively running well and voluntarily participating, becoming a good form of people's lives under the socialist system, and is loved and supported by the broad masses.

In all the well-run canteens in the province, there are the following characteristics: First, the Party's leadership has been strengthened, and politics has been put in command. In many places, it is called "politics enters the canteen, and the secretary goes down to the kitchen." Leading cadres are assigned responsibilities and contracted to run the canteen well. Party members, League members, and activists from poor and lower-middle peasants who are enthusiastic about service, fair and capable, and connected with the masses are selected and sent to the canteen to serve as managers, cooks, and other work, establishing the leading advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Second, there is a family background and production for the canteen. Establish the canteen's special granary, vegetable garden, pig farm, poultry farm, workshops for making starch, sauce, vinegar, and rice and flour processing plants. Achieve self-sufficiency in oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables, and realize that meals do not cost money. Third, implement planned grain use, save grain, adjust grain and vegetables, and improve life, so that commune members can eat enough and eat well, fully demonstrating the superiority of the canteen. Fourth, carry out technological innovation and revolution in the canteen, implement cooking utensil reform, and improve cooking techniques, thereby continuously improving the quality of meals and saving labor. Fifth, implement democratic management, follow the mass line well, consult with the masses on everything, not only reflecting the requirements of the majority, but also solving the special problems of the minority. Make the accounts public and clear every day and every month, so that the commune members are clear. At present, more than 60,000 secretaries of Party organizations at all levels in the province have gone deep into the canteens to help the masses run the canteens well; most canteens have established their own granaries; more than 120,000 canteens have established vegetable gardens and pig farms; and more than 10,460 canteens have achieved self-sufficiency in oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables. The technological innovation and democratic management movement of the province's canteens is being carried out universally and deeply.

In comprehensively organizing people's lives in the countryside, in addition to first running public canteens well, what the broad masses further demand to solve are the problems of taking care of children, treating diseases, and collective welfare and life service undertakings such as sewing, making shoes, and cultural and recreational activities. That is, to organize more widely and comprehensively realize the socialization of housework. Thanks to the strengthening of leadership by Party and government at all levels, these undertakings are now developing rapidly around the canteen as the center. The people's communes in the province's rural areas have organized more than 230,000 nurseries (groups) and kindergartens, with more than 3.6 million children enrolled and entrusted, and most of them have implemented free childcare. More than 7,000 medical and health organizations have been established, initially forming a medical and health network. Many people's communes have also established old-age homes, maternity homes, sewing groups, bathhouses, clubs, and other service organizations, so that the commune members' clothing, food, housing, transportation, and cultural and recreational activities have been properly arranged. Because these organizations are set up in accordance with the principles of serving production, cooperating and helping each other, each giving full play to their strengths, self-service, and practicing economy, they not only do not increase service personnel, but also improve labor attendance rates. Political and cultural, technical learning, and various cultural and recreational activities are also greatly active. Fully demonstrating the great superiority of organizing, collectivizing life, and socializing housework.

		In the cities

In organizing people's lives in the cities, we have adopted the policy of focusing on improving the lives of workers and staff, while also improving the lives of street residents; starting from organizing production and promoting production, ensuring high-speed construction, and serving production and life; taking the canteen as the center and vigorously developing various social service undertakings. Now, more than 17,000 public canteens, more than 12,000 nurseries, and more than 6,800 various life service stations have been established in the province's cities. Thanks to the development of these collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, not only can the broad masses of workers and staff participate in production better, but also more than 400,000 urban housewives have been freed from family affairs and participated in social production and social services, adding a new force to socialist construction. In this regard, the Guangfu Road Street in Tianjin has set an advanced example. Under the unified leadership of the Party, with state-owned commercial departments as the backbone, they organized large-scale cooperation among various factories, enterprises, institutions, organizations, culture and education, health and other related departments, starting from developing production, combining planned supply, rational distribution of goods, and guiding consumption to organize the lives of the masses. They first helped the factories and enterprises run the workers' and staff canteens well, reasonably distributing various non-staple foods according to the needs of workers and staff of different productions and different types of work, so that different workers and staff could eat suitable meals. At the same time, a large number of cooks were trained, and chefs from restaurants were organized to impart skills and improve the quality of meals, so that workers and staff could eat their fill, eat well, eat economically, and feel comfortable. In running street canteens, the same principle of actively running well and voluntarily participating was followed. According to the characteristics of urban residents with different classes, different ethnic groups, different living standards, and different living habits, various types of canteens were established. In particular, a large-scale mechanized staple and non-staple food processing station was established. With only more than 60 cooks, 35,000 people's staple and non-staple foods could be made, with one or two hundred varieties, which were supplied to various canteens separately, achieving saving people, saving coal, and saving grain, and meeting the different needs of various people. Workers, staff, and residents can join whole groups, half groups, or holiday groups, and can buy staple or non-staple foods separately, which is free and convenient. In developing social service undertakings, they adopted a method of combining state assistance, organizing organs and enterprises to run their own, and mass mutual assistance services, with the service station run by state-owned stores as the core, and various production service cooperatives establishing collective-owned branch stations, and various residential areas establishing mass mutual assistance service groups and family service personnel. The whole street formed a star-studded social service network. From taking care of children, washing clothes, sewing, repairing, haircutting, bathing, beautifying the family, to taking care of patients, asking doctors on behalf of others, handling weddings and funerals, environmental sanitation, etc., everyone has something to do, everything is taken care of, production develops, income increases, and life improves. This warm and new socialized way of life greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for labor. They said: "The service enthusiasm of the masses has been activated into our cells." Therefore, their enthusiasm doubled and production increased. Last year, all 36 factories on the street completed their tasks ahead of schedule by about one month. Thanks to the good running of public canteens and the comprehensive organization of people's lives, 90% of the women's labor force on the street was freed from family affairs and participated in social production. At the same time, the political and ideological awareness of the masses has been rapidly improved, love for socialism, love for the collective, and mutual assistance and friendship have become the fashion, and the desire to progress and learn has been greatly enhanced, forming a comprehensive climax of political and ideological, production and construction, and cultural movements. At present, we are carrying out a mass movement to learn from Guangfu Road and catch up with Guangfu Road in urban and rural areas throughout the province, so that this movement to comprehensively organize people's lives and promote socialist construction will rapidly develop widely and deeply.

In practice, we have further realized that production and life are inseparable, and the development of socialist production methods inevitably requires the establishment and development of a way of life that is compatible with it. Under the leadership of the Party, according to the demands and wishes of the masses, guiding the masses to organize and manage their own lives, and taking the path of collectivization is an important step to further adapt the relations of production to the development of productive forces, and is an important component of socialist construction. We have already established a line from top to bottom to lead the people's lives, and as production develops, we will organize people's lives more beautifully, thereby promoting the sustained Great Leap Forward in production and realizing the great task of building socialism at a high speed.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct it.

### 以食堂为中心全面组织人民生活  刘子厚代表介绍河北省城乡人民生活集体化的经验

专栏：

    以食堂为中心全面组织人民生活
    刘子厚代表介绍河北省城乡人民生活集体化的经验各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。现在我就以食堂为中心全面组织人民生活问题作以下的发言。
    河北省人民，在以毛主席为首的党中央和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在1958年和1959年社会主义建设连续大跃进的基础上，今年继续跃进。目前，全省农村正在开展着轰轰烈烈的亩产千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯的大面积丰产运动，由于去冬积肥、水利和田间管理搞得好，今年麦子普遍长的好；在城市，广大职工正在深入开展着以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，第一季度各项主要工业生产计划都超额完成。各方面的情况表明，1960年仍然是高速度持续大跃进的局面。
    随着社会主义建设的持续跃进，随着城乡人民公社的巩固和发展，各方面对劳动力的要求急剧增加，社会上原来的闲散劳动力已普遍得到就业，大量的家庭妇女投入生产建设，这样，原来各个家庭的生活问题，就日益变成社会性的问题了，家务劳动社会化成为必然的趋势。广大人民迫切要求党和政府领导他们组织起来，搞好生活。因此，全面地搞好人民生活，就成为社会主义建设中一个新的重大课题了。
    关心发展生产，关心人民生活，是我们党的一贯方针，也是党的光荣传统。党中央和毛主席从早就不断地指示我们：群众的干劲越大，我们就越要关心群众生活，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。河北省各级党政领导是认真贯彻执行了中央的方针和毛主席的指示的。
    在全面组织人民生活中我们体会到，首要的问题是解决几千万人的吃饭问题。也就是首先要解决粮食问题和办好公共食堂。河北省历年来就是一个缺粮的省，过去几年来，每年要由中央从各兄弟省调给我们几亿到几十亿斤粮食。因此，我们下决心解决这个问题。经过几年的奋斗，农业生产有了不少的发展，特别是近两年来，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，广大群众干劲更高，连续两年大跃进，终于实现了全省粮食基本自给。这不能不说是我省一个有历史意义的重大胜利。当然，目前我省粮食的情况还是不宽裕的，还必须千方百计地继续增产粮食，我们把发展农业生产、特别是增产粮食，作为全省工作的中心任务。
        在农村里
    河北省农村的公共食堂是在1958年大跃进和人民公社化运动中大量发展起来的。它同其他新生事物一样，当中走过一段曲折发展的过程，现在已经走上巩固健全发展的道路。目前，全省农村共有食堂二十一万多个，参加食堂的人数占农村总人口的92％。在这些食堂中，办得好的和较好的占80％以上，其中更有两万三千多个办得很出色。这些办得好的食堂，不仅成了社员生活不可分离的社会主义大家庭，并且形成社员政治、经济、文化活动的中心场所。像新乐城关人民公社东紫烟生产队的食堂就是一个典型。
    东紫烟生产队的食堂，是在1958年春季大跃进中群众自觉地成立起来的，经过两年的发展，已经达到比较健全的程度。他们做到了吃得饱、吃得好、吃得省，食堂的饭菜，按着农作季节变换花样，有冷有热，有干有稀，有菜有汤，可以几天不重。对不同的社员和特殊问题，如老人、小孩、孕妇、产妇、婚丧嫁娶、疾病、节日、亲友来往等都有妥善安排和照顾。他们在米面加工、炊具、做饭技术方面开展了技术革新技术革命运动，创造了一畜四磨、齿轮快碾、土制自来水、切菜机、万能灶等等，实现了半机械化。全村参加食堂的一千五百八十多人，原来米面加工和作饭，共用一百六十四人，开展技术革新以后，现在只用三十八人，节约劳动力三倍多。如与成立食堂以前比较，就节约更多了。同时，还减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度，提高了饭菜质量。做到了“粗粮变细粮，死面变活面，吃薯不见薯，吃菜变成馅”。不但生活搞得好，去年一年还节约粮食八万多斤。特别应当提起的是，由于食堂经营了菜园、养猪和制粉等副业生产，达到了油盐柴菜等自给自足，加上生产队的分配实行口粮供给制，这样就保证了社员吃饭不要钱。所以食堂受到社员的热烈拥护。他们写了成千上百首的诗歌来歌颂食堂，说：“公社好比红太阳，太阳出来照食堂，食堂巧煮千家饭，饭好菜香心舒畅。”由于生活搞的好，社员生产积极性非常高涨，解放出大批劳动力投入生产，出勤率和劳动生产率不断提高。这个村原来是很贫困的，历年粮食不够吃，过着糠菜半年粮的日子，过去每年要由国家供应粮食一、二十万斤。近两年来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，成立了人民公社，办起了食堂，生产高速度增长，1958年就由缺粮变余粮，卖给国家余粮十八万多斤，1959年继续大跃进，卖余粮三十一万多斤，除去各项消费粮和籽种外，还储备粮食十五万多斤（每人平均近百斤）。同时，随着生产的集体化、家务劳动社会化的发展，使人们的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，共产主义精神高度发扬。社员们下地回来，就自觉地帮助炊事员做饭、扫地，炊事员对有病的社员，就另做好的面汤、饭菜，送到家去，问寒问暖，大家如同生活在一个大家庭里，团结友爱，休戚相共，敬老抚幼，互助互济。特别是广大妇女，不仅得到经济上、生活上的解放，并且得到思想上的解放，同男子并驾齐驱，成为生产建设上的重要力量。许多妇女作诗赞扬食堂说：“全民办食堂，妇女真解放，男女齐下地，共同进食堂，全村成一家，心花喜洋洋。”所有这些，都充分显示了公共食堂的优越性，显示了社会主义生产和生活方式的优越性。公共食堂成为巩固人民公社的重要阵地。自然，我举的这个例子，是食堂中办得好的一个。但是全省类似这样的食堂已经不是少数的，而是成千上万的了。所以，纵然有少数的人仍然怀疑、不赞成甚至反对公共食堂，而公共食堂终于按着积极办好、自愿参加的原则发展成长起来，成为社会主义制度下人民生活的一种好的形式，为广大群众所热爱拥护。
    在全省这些办得好的食堂中，概括起来有这样几个特征：一是加强了党的领导，实行政治挂帅，许多地方叫做“政治进食堂，书记下伙房”，领导干部，分工负责，包干办好食堂。选派热心服务、公道能干、联系群众的党员、团员和贫农、下中农的积极分子到食堂去担任管理员、炊事员和其它工作，树立起贫农下中农的领导优势。二是有了食堂的家底和生产。建立起食堂的专用粮库、菜园、养猪场、家禽饲养场、制造淀粉、酱、醋作坊和米面加工厂等等。做到了油盐柴菜自给自足，和实现了吃饭不要钱。三是实行计划用粮，节约用粮，粮菜调剂，改善生活，使社员吃得饱、吃得好，充分显示出食堂的优越性。四是开展起食堂里的技术革新技术革命，实行炊具改革，提高烹饪技术，从而不断提高了饭菜质量，和节省了劳动力。五是实行民主管理，群众路线走的好，遇事同群众商量，不但体现多数人的要求，并且解决少数人的特殊问题。做到帐目公开，日清月结，使社员心明眼亮。目前，全省已有各级党组织的书记六万多人深入到食堂去，帮助群众办好食堂；多数食堂都建立起自己的粮库；有十二万多食堂建立起了菜园和养猪场；有一万零四百六十多食堂已经实现了油盐柴菜自给自足。全省食堂的技术革新和民主管理运动正在普遍深入开展。
    在农村全面组织人民生活中，除首先搞好公共食堂以外，广大群众进一步要求解决的便是看孩子的问题，疾病治疗问题，以及缝纫、做鞋、文娱活动等集体福利和生活服务事业。也就是更广泛地组织起来，全面地实现家务劳动社会化，由于各级党政加强领导，目前，这些事业围绕以食堂为中心，正在迅速发展起来。全省农村人民公社已经组织起来的托儿所（组）、幼儿园共二十三万多个，入园受托儿童三百六十多万，并且多数的实行了看孩子不要钱。共建立起各种医疗保健组织七千多处，初步形成了一个医疗保健网，许多人民公社还搞起了敬老院、妇产院、缝纫组、洗澡堂、俱乐部等各种服务组织，使社员的衣、食、住、行、文娱活动都有了妥善的安排。由于这些组织是根据着服务生产、合作互助、各尽所长、自我服务、厉行节约的原则搞起来的，不但不增加服务性人员，而且提高了劳动出勤率，政治文化、技术学习和各种文娱活动亦大大活跃起来。充分显示了组织起来、生活集体化、家务劳动社会化的巨大优越性。
        在城市里
    在城市中组织人民生活，我们采取了以搞好职工生活为重点，同时搞好街道居民的生活；从组织生产和推动生产入手，保障高速度建设，为生产生活服务；以食堂为中心，大力发展各种社会服务事业的方针。现在全省城市已办起各种公共食堂一万七千多个，托儿所一万二千多个，各种生活服务站六千八百多个。由于这些集体福利事业和社会服务事业的发展，不仅使广大职工能够更好地参加生产，而且使四十多万城市家庭妇女摆脱了家庭事务，参加了社会生产和社会服务，为社会主义建设增加了一支生力军。在这方面，天津市的光复道街作出了先进的榜样。他们在党的统一领导下，以国营商业部门为骨干，组织各工厂企业、机关团体、文教卫生等有关部门大协作，从发展生产入手，把计划供应、合理分配商品和指导消费相结合，来组织群众生活。他们首先帮助各工厂企业办好职工食堂，根据着不同生产、不同工种的职工的生活需要，有计划地合理分配各种副食品，使不同的职工都能够吃上适合需要的饭菜，同时，大量培训炊事人员，组织饭馆的厨师传授技术，提高饭菜的质量，使职工们吃饱、吃好、吃省，心情舒畅。在办街道食堂方面，同样按照积极办好、自愿参加的原则，根据城市居民有不同阶层不同民族和生活水平不同、生活习惯不同等特点，办起了各种类型的食堂，特别是建立起一个机械化的大型主副食加工站，只六十多个炊事员，可以作出三万五千人的主副食品，花样一、二百种，分别供应各个食堂，做到了省人、省煤、省粮，满足各种人的不同需要。职工、居民们可以入整伙、半伙、假日伙，可以单买主食或副食，自由方便。在发展社会服务事业方面，他们采取国家帮助，组织机关、企业自办和群众互助服务相结合的方法，以国营商店办的服务总站为核心，各个生产服务社建立集体所有性质的分站，各个居民区建立群众互助性质的服务小组和家庭服务员，全街形成一个星罗棋布的社会服务网。从看孩子、洗衣服、缝补、修理、理发、洗澡、美化家庭、到护理病人、代请医生、办理婚、丧事务、环境卫生等等，做到人人有事做，事事有人管，生产发展，收入增加，生活改善。这种温暖的新型的社会化的生活方式，大大地激发了职工的劳动热情。他们说：“群众的服务热情，活跃到我们的细胞里来了”。因而干劲加倍，生产加番，去年全街三十六个工厂，全部提前一月左右超额完成了任务。由于公共食堂办的好，全面地组织起人民生活，使全街90％的妇女劳力摆脱了家庭事务，参加了社会生产。同时，群众政治思想觉悟迅速提高，热爱社会主义、热爱集体、互助友爱成为风尚，要求进步、要求学习的心情大大增强，形成了全面的政治思想、生产建设和文化运动高潮。目前，我们正在全省城乡开展学光复道、赶光复道的群众运动，使这种全面地组织人民生活、促进社会主义建设的运动迅速地向广阔深入发展。
    在实践中我们进一步体会到，生产和生活是不可分割的，社会主义生产方式的发展，必然要求建立和发展与之相适应的生活方式。在党的领导下，依据群众的要求和愿望，引导群众组织起来，管好自己的生活，走集体化的道路，是使生产关系进一步适合于生产力发展的重要步骤，是社会主义建设的重要组成部分。我们已经从上到下建立起一条领导人民生活的战线，随着生产的发展，把人民生活组织得更美好，从而促进生产的持续大跃进，实现高速度建设社会主义的伟大任务。
    以上发言，有不妥之处，请批评指正。
