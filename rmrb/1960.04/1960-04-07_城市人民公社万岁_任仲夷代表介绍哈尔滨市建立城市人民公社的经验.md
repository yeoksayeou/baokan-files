Long Live the Urban People's Commune

Representative Ren Zhongyi Introduces the Experience of Establishing Urban People's Communes in Harbin City

Fellow Representatives, Comrades:

I completely agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now I will briefly report on the situation of establishing urban people's communes in Harbin City, and I welcome your criticisms and suggestions.

Urban People's Communes are the Inevitable Product of Social Development

The work of piloting urban people's communes in Harbin City began in late August 1958. Over the past year or so, eight people's communes have been established in the city's urban districts, with a population of over 1,270,000 people, accounting for 70.6% of the total urban population. The practice of the past year or so has proved that the emergence of urban people's communes is by no means accidental, but the inevitable product of China's economic and political development. It is imperative and must be done.

In 1958, Harbin City, like other parts of the country, was a year of comprehensive development and a great leap forward in socialist construction. Due to the great leap forward in production, there was an urgent need to vigorously develop cooperation, especially to organize cooperation on the spot among large, medium, and small enterprises. On the one hand, small enterprises were organized to serve large and medium-sized enterprises, developing the production of key enterprises; on the other hand, with the help of large and medium-sized enterprises, the production of small enterprises was developed. Due to the comprehensive great leap forward in production, the phenomenon of labor shortage became increasingly prominent. According to the requirements of the 1958 production leap forward plan, the city needed to supplement more than 200,000 workers. So many people, not only could the countryside not produce them all at once, but even if they could, the sudden influx of a large number of people into the city would bring great difficulties to the city's non-staple food supply, housing, and transportation. Mobilizing urban housewives and idle labor to find employment and participate in social labor was an important way to solve this problem, but the employment of the vast number of housewives urgently required the establishment of various welfare services to socialize housework. Due to the comprehensive development of district and street industrial production and social welfare undertakings, the work of the original district and street governments, such as: health, social relief, mediation of disputes, and propaganda and education, some of which were reduced, and some of which basically became the internal work of factories and enterprises, but the work of managing production and managing collective life greatly increased compared to before.

The emergence of all these problems shows that urban work has greatly developed, and some links in the relations of production and the superstructure have not been able to fully adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces and the economic base, and some necessary reforms and adjustments must be implemented. At that time, due to the great victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the deep-rooted popularity of the Party's general line for socialist construction, people's ideological awareness was unprecedentedly improved, and almost everyone was trying their best to find ways to solve the above-mentioned problems in order to accelerate China's socialist construction. For example, some places planned to merge factories and street offices (such as Xiangfang District's "Bearing Street" formed with the state-owned Bearing Factory as the center), some places formed "Cooperation Committees" by various state-owned enterprises, and some places formed "Production Service Cooperatives" by street industries and street residents' collective welfare units... etc. It was at this time that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward that the people's commune is a good form to accelerate socialist construction and transition from socialism to communism in the future. Therefore, according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, we began the work of piloting people's communes in urban areas.

Urban People's Communes Have Shown Strong Vitality and Unparalleled Superiority

The practice of piloting urban people's communes in Harbin City has proved that urban people's communes are the best organizational form for implementing the general line of socialist construction in cities. Although it has only been a little over a year since its birth, it, like the rural people's commune, has shown strong vitality and unparalleled superiority, and has played a significant role in promoting economic construction and cultural construction, and in organizing people's economic life.

First, it has promoted the comprehensive and great development of industrial production and construction. In the past year or so, in all communes, the industrial production operated by state-owned, local state-owned or communes has been greatly developed and achieved a great leap forward. In 1959, the average industrial output value of all people's communes in the city increased by 70% compared to the great leap forward in 1958. Among them, the Xiangfang People's Commune, which was established with the state-owned Bearing Factory as the center, increased its total industrial output value of state-owned and local state-owned enterprises by 60% in 1959 compared to 1958, completing the annual leap forward plan sixty-two days ahead of schedule. The Power Township People's Commune, which was established with the state-owned Motor Factory, Turbine Factory, and Boiler Factory as the center, increased its total industrial output value of state-owned and local state-owned enterprises by 51% in 1959 compared to 1958, and completed the second five-year plan's power generation equipment targets three years and three months ahead of schedule as early as September last year. In addition, the total industrial output value of the commune-run industries in these two communes has also increased by more than double. This year, the total output value of the city's commune industries and street industries is expected to reach more than 820 million yuan, accounting for about one-fifth of the city's total industrial output value last year, which is equivalent to more than 20 times the city's total industrial output value at the time of liberation.

The reason why various enterprises in the commune can make a comprehensive leap forward is that, under the unified leadership of the commune, the Party's "walking on two legs" policy has been effectively implemented, and in the spirit of "ensuring key points and driving the general," mutual support and cooperation between large, medium, and small enterprises have been organized in a planned way. For example, in 1958, the Harbin Bearing Factory had to produce a large number of bearings according to national requirements, but the auxiliary production could not keep up, and some of the cooperation relationships with other places were also interrupted, and the task was very tight. The commune party committee mobilized the workers of small and medium-sized factories in the commune to provide support, and as a result, the bearing factory was guaranteed to complete the state's production tasks three days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the commune's satellite bearing, Jianxin Machinery, and foundry small and medium-sized factories have also been greatly developed with the help of large factories. For example, with the help of the state-owned Bearing Factory, the original straw rope factory with only dozens of people was rebuilt into a satellite bearing factory. In just over a year, it has developed into a factory with more than 60 machine tools and more than 600 workers. Last year, it produced more than 100,000 sets of bearings annually, equivalent to the national output at the time of China's liberation, and this year it plans to produce 1 million sets, almost equivalent to ten times the national bearing output at the time of liberation. Due to the strengthening of communist cooperation between enterprises, the phenomenon of factories and buildings being connected, chimneys facing each other, the sound of machines being heard, but almost never interacting with each other in the past has been changed. In the past, the cooperative relationships of many factories and enterprises almost covered the entire country, and often, in order to match a product, they had to travel thousands of miles across the country. However, after the establishment of the people's commune, the organization of cooperation on the spot greatly supplemented the shortcomings of the cooperation organized by the state, ensuring the urgent needs of production. For example, in the second half of 1958, eight machine tools in the bearing factory of the Xiangfang People's Commune were about to stop production due to the lack of "tool bars." According to the past cooperative relationship, it would take at least half a month to solve the problem, but due to the commune organizing the commune-run machinery factory to process them, the goods were delivered in one day. For example, the bearing factory, steel rolling factory, and brewery in this commune are only a wall apart, but because they belong to different subordinate relationships (they belong to the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, the Municipal First Bureau of Industry, and the Municipal Second Bureau of Industry, respectively), and their party relationships do not belong to the local party committee's leadership, they have rarely interacted in the past. After the formation of the commune, their relationship immediately changed. When the commune was just established, the steel rolling factory found that the bearing factory's production tasks were tight, and took the initiative to tap its potential to help them forge semi-finished products; when the steel rolling factory's power supply was insufficient, affecting production, the brewery took the initiative to use its own power generation equipment to send electricity to them; the toothed wheel of the brewery's saccharification pot was broken, and if it was repaired elsewhere according to the past routine, it would have to stop production for at least a month, but after the commune organized cooperation, the workers of the steel rolling factory rushed to repair it in one day and night. There are many such examples, and the members and workers call this locally organized cooperative relationship "old neighbors and new friends." Now, the cooperative relationship between various departments is becoming more planned and more organized. For example, the Xiangfang Commune convenes cooperative meetings every month, and on average, each meeting raises no less than eighty or ninety cooperative issues, of which 80% are resolved; the Power Township People's Commune organized 1,686 cooperations in nine months last year, solving tens of thousands of problems. Because the cooperation organized by the people's commune closely combines the large, medium, and small enterprises, heavy industry and light industry, and state-owned, local state-owned, and commune-run enterprises in the commune, supporting each other, comprehensively utilizing resources, and fully tapping potential, it not only ensures the completion of the state's key production tasks, but also promotes the comprehensive leap forward of the entire industrial production and construction.

Second, it has promoted the comprehensive and great development of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production. The Xiangfang, Pingfang, Power Township, Taiping, and Daowai communes in Harbin City are all people's communes composed of nearby rural areas that have both industry and agriculture. In the past year or so, in addition to leading industrial production, these communes have vigorously organized agricultural and sideline production in accordance with the principle of "suburban production serves the city" and "self-reliance is the main thing, and striving for foreign aid is the auxiliary," established non-staple food production bases or farms, and under the conditions of encountering serious natural disasters such as drought, insects, diseases, and hail, they have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of thriving livestock and abundant grains. According to the statistics of five communes in the city, the vegetable output in 1959 reached 487 million catties, an increase of 1.3 times compared to 1958. By the end of February this year, there were 100,310 pigs, an increase of 2.3 times compared to 1958, and 774,000 chickens, an increase of 1.5 times compared to 1958. Sixteen0,000 square meters of new vegetable greenhouses were established. The Xiangfang Commune alone built 50,000 square meters of greenhouses last year, which is equivalent to more than double the total area of greenhouses built in Harbin City in the past 60 years. This not only further developed the rural economy and met the needs of people's lives, but also supported fraternal cities with a considerable amount of vegetables. The Xiangfang People's Commune alone took out 3 million catties of the best quality vegetables to support the capital—Beijing.

In the development of agricultural and sideline production, the communes not only organized rural labor, transportation tools, and non-staple food to support the cities (according to the statistics of the Xiangfang and Power Township People's Communes, more than 38,000 rural laborers and more than 8,700 vehicles were organized last year to support the production of various factories and enterprises), and they also organized the cities to support the rural areas, especially the near-suburban rural areas, with great efforts. Under the unified leadership and planning of the commune, various factories and enterprises, in the spirit of tapping the potential of enterprises and the principle of equivalent exchange, adopted the method of linking factories (agricultural management areas) to manufacture agricultural tools and equipment for rural areas with edge materials and waste materials, or to take out old machinery and stagnant materials to support rural areas. For example, in Pingfang Commune, thanks to the commune organizing urban support for rural areas, by the end of 1959, the commune's agricultural management area had established 59 small and medium-sized factories and enterprises such as machinery repair factories, iron factories, wood factories, fertilizer factories, brick factories, grain and rice processing factories, and soil fertilizer analysis stations. In the past, the Chaoyang and Pingfang sub-communes of the commune even ran to the city to hang horseshoes. Now, with mechanical repair factories, they can not only manufacture general agricultural tools or mechanical parts, but also repair large agricultural tools, tractors, and automobiles. Six of the eight agricultural production brigades in Xiangfang Commune have basically realized mechanization and electrification in non-field operations such as water pumping, threshing, and grass cutting. All production management areas of the Power Township People's Commune have basically realized the mechanization or semi-mechanization of cultivated land and transportation. In terms of electrification, all communes in the city have basically realized that every household has electric lights, every team has telephones, and every village has broadcasts. Therefore, some people wrote poems to praise: "The people's commune has great power, the worker-peasant alliance is one family, united as one is incomparable, and we are not afraid of any difficulties." This has further strengthened the relationship between urban and rural areas, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and greatly promoted the technological transformation of agriculture.

Third, it has promoted the complete liberation of women and effectively reformed the unreasonable lifestyles left over from the old society. With the participation of the vast number of housewives in social labor, there is an urgent need to socialize housework. In order to meet this need, at the beginning of the commune's establishment, the communes, in the spirit of the masses doing it themselves, starting from scratch, and completely voluntary participation, established more than 6,000 public canteens and more than 9,100 nurseries and kindergartens, greatly reducing the burden of housework for women, so that they can work with peace of mind. As they said: "There is a lot of happiness in the kindergarten, big and small children laugh happily; parents feel as sweet as honey, and go to work without worry; go all out to strive for the top, and build a better new life; thank the Party's general line for cultivating new social flowers." However, these collective welfare undertakings alone are far from meeting the needs of the vast number of workers and masses. Therefore, at the beginning of last year, the masses created a new organization to meet this need—street service stations. Now, more than 6,550 service stations have been established in the city. Because street service stations have flexible service methods, low fees, and a wide range of services, from washing, sewing, cooking, childcare, caring for patients, buying things on behalf of others, subscribing to newspapers, pre-ordering theater tickets, cleaning houses, beautifying homes, to weddings and funerals, etc., they are warmly welcomed by the vast number of workers and masses. They said: In the past, "it was a mess in the morning and evening, and there was a division of labor on holidays, you bought coal and I mixed it, you watched the children and I bought rice, and if the division of labor was not proper, we would quarrel," but now: "Service stations are really convenient, and sporadic housework can be done on behalf of others; watching children and buying rice noodles have greatly changed daily life." Because the vast number of women get rid of housework, participate in production, increase their income, and learn production technology, their social status has been greatly improved, and the unreasonable lifestyles of the past have been changed, promoting the development of new and happy family relationships. In addition, street service stations are also a mass-based mutual assistance organization, which has greatly promoted people's collectivist concepts and the growth of communist moral qualities. Now, the atmosphere of selflessness for the public, helping others for fun, caring for each other, and voluntary labor is greatly promoted. New people and new things of harmonious families and united neighborhoods are emerging one after another. Many workers hand over the keys to the service station when they go to work, so that they can clean the houses and beautify their homes on their behalf. Many workers also hand over their wages to the service station and entrust them to plan their family expenses on their behalf. The service station has become the housekeeper most trusted by the masses. The selfish mentality of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and do not care about the frost on other people's roofs" has been greatly changed, and the relationship between people has become closer.

Fourth, it has promoted the high-speed development of culture, education, and science and technology. After the vast number of masses generally participated in social labor, they urgently demanded to improve their political, technical, and cultural levels. And because the commune comprehensively arranged life, it created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for learning politics, technology, and culture. In the past year or so, the communes have held a large number of spare-time schools. This year, 30 factories and enterprises have established full-time universities, and individual factories have even piloted a system of six hours of work and four hours of study. In the past year, the number of people participating in various studies in the communes of the city has increased greatly. For example, Xiangfang Commune increased by 6.7 times, and Power Township Commune increased by 10 times. Now, the vast number of members not only actively participate in various cultural studies on the basis of eliminating illiteracy, but also strive to master cutting-edge technology and climb the peak of science. With the help of national scientific research institutions, the communes have established scientific research organizations including electrical machinery, welding, instruments, meters, and chemicals. And they have created excellent results. For example, a small chemical experiment factory transformed from a bathroom in Xiangfang People's Commune has made a great revolution in technology and completely changed the process method of producing ethyl acetate, saving huge and complex distillation equipment and increasing efficiency by 630 times. In addition, because the commune reasonably utilizes various cultural and entertainment venues and equipment within the commune, it has greatly promoted the cultural and entertainment activities of the masses. All of this has created extremely favorable conditions for further developing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

Fifth, in addition to the above points, the establishment of urban people's communes has also played a great role in promoting people's democracy, further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, enhancing the unity of the people, and promoting socialist transformation.

As early as December 1958, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee pointed out that "the people's communes in cities will, in the future, in a form suitable for urban characteristics, become a tool for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities, a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution, and people's livelihood and welfare, and a social organization combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and integrating government and commune." The practice of our piloting of urban people's communes over the past year has proved that these instructions are completely suitable for the situation in Harbin City and are completely correct. Although the current people's commune is not perfect enough, it can be clearly seen from the above facts that it is rapidly developing in the direction of becoming increasingly sound. We fully believe that with its continuous consolidation, improvement, and development, it will surely play a greater role in continuously developing social productive forces and improving people's ideological awareness, and in gradually narrowing and even eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between manual and mental labor.

At present, the situation in Harbin City is extremely good. The work of piloting urban people's communes has entered a new stage, and a new upsurge in the movement to run urban people's communes in a big way has appeared throughout the city. We are determined to continue to strengthen leadership in an all-round way in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, adhere to the principle of "being both active and cautious," actively and continuously promote the consolidation, improvement, and development of urban people's communes, give full play to its superiority, promote the comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economy, and promote the rapid change of the entire social outlook.

The People's Commune Greatly Increased the Organizational Degree of Urban People

The greatest superiority of the people's commune lies in greatly increasing the organizational degree of the city. Organization is strength. Constantly improving the organization of all work will generate new and enormous strength. Therefore, we are prepared to strengthen the organization of production, life and education in all places in the city where communes have been established and are being established, in accordance with the characteristics of the commune. Specifically, it is to establish and improve four "networks" in all communes.

The first "network" is the production cooperation "network." For example, in terms of industry, under the guidance of the "walking on two legs" policy, large enterprises should be the backbone, and large, medium and small enterprises should be closely combined to widely carry out communist cooperation. Through this cooperation, in addition to first ensuring the completion and over-completion of the state plan, the commune should also run some factories and enterprises that are of decisive significance for accelerating the comprehensive development of the national economy and for consolidating the commune. Now, some communes want to run chemical factories and daily necessities factories, some want to run small internal combustion engine factories, generator factories, turbine factories, boiler factories, and three-wheeled automobile factories, and some want to run electron tube factories and radio factories that serve cutting-edge technology. According to the statistics of seven communes in the city, this year, they will all adopt the mass line, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and build more than 3,650 small enterprises everywhere. 2,306 have been built and put into production; Nangang District, which is preparing to build a commune, will build 500 radio factories this year, and 206 have been built recently. Some communes are also actively realizing "five rings" with the commune as the unit, namely "ring power supply", "ring water supply", "ring steam supply", "ring gas supply" and "ring transportation". "Five rings" are a major development of communist cooperation. The realization of "five rings" will surely produce huge economic effects. According to 70 ring power supply points in the city, due to the realization of "four-in-one" ring power supply, a total of 581 transformers, 200,000 meters of wires of various specifications, 7,000 meters of cable, 640 electric poles and other large quantities of power supply equipment were dismantled, and it is estimated that 12 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved throughout the year, which can solve the problem of insufficient power supply in 175 units.

The second "network" is the people's economic life network. First of all, it is necessary to further base the production of non-staple foods in the near suburbs. In this regard, all communes have formulated grand plans, such as: building 100,000 square meters of greenhouses, 10,000 square meters of vegetable cellars, 10,000 square meters of mushroom rooms, 10,000 square meters of cold storage, millions of potted vegetables, Wanji Mountain, Wandaya Bay, Wanzhu Farm, 10,000 acres of 10,000 catties of vegetable experimental fields, etc. The realization of these plans is entirely possible, and the realization of these plans will surely raise Harbin's non-staple food production to a new level, and the supply of non-staple foods will be greatly increased. Secondly, it is necessary to organize the people's economic life more comprehensively, with state-owned commerce as the backbone, and closely combine state-owned commerce, service industry with the welfare undertakings of factories, schools, and institutions, and the service undertakings of streets. All communes are now actively building public dormitories, new residential areas, and actively developing urban construction, and are striving to realize "four modernizations" as soon as possible, namely, nurseries, canteens, service station networks, and reasonable housing for workers, in accordance with the principle of the masses doing it themselves, close cooperation in all aspects, active national assistance, and completely voluntary participation.

The third "network" is the cultural and educational network. Under the guiding principle of "one main, two secondary, and three combinations", with the regular schools and art troupes run by the state as the backbone, closely combine the schools of all levels and types run by the state and communes, enterprises, and institutions, as well as other cultural and art organizations, and widely organize workers and masses to study politics, culture, and technology. Now, all communes have established or are actively establishing regular or amateur universities, and are generally establishing various primary and secondary amateur schools and various literary and art organizations. With the formation and development of the cultural and educational network, people's cultural life will be further greatly enlivened.

The fourth "network" is the science and technology network. Under the guiding principle of "one main, two secondary, and three combinations", with the state's scientific research institutions as the backbone, combine the scientific research forces of state scientific research institutions and factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions, and widely carry out scientific and technological activities. Now, all communes are generally establishing scientific research organizations in accordance with this spirit. It is estimated that by the end of the year, more than 170 mechanical processing, electrical and other research institutes (stations) and more than 1,600 scientific research groups can be established in the seven communes, and up to 20,000 people can participate in scientific research activities. This will play an important role in promoting the development of industrial production in the direction of high, large, precision, cutting-edge, and new technologies, in accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture, and in rapidly cultivating and building a scientific and technological team.

"Networks" and "rings" mean further organization. Further organization, of course, is not just to do these aspects of work. In other aspects, appropriate forms should also be adopted to further tap potential forces. We believe that through these efforts, the degree of organization in cities will be greatly improved, the speed of socialist construction will be greatly accelerated, people's spiritual outlook will be even more changed, and communist factors will increase even more.

The People's Commune Brought a New Upsurge in Socialist Construction

Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, the work of piloting urban people's communes in Harbin City has achieved some successes and experiences due to the active efforts of the people of the city. At present, a magnificent new upsurge in socialist construction has emerged in Harbin City. This upsurge includes: a new upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism with the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works as the center, a new upsurge in technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, a new upsurge in cultural revolution centered on popularizing and improving national education and climbing the peak of science, and a new upsurge in comprehensively organizing economic and cultural life centered on developing collective welfare undertakings. The convergence of these four major movements has formed a huge revolutionary torrent, violently washing away the marks left over from the old society and powerfully promoting the leap forward development of socialist construction. We are determined to hold high the glorious banner of the people's commune under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the spirit of this conference, go all out, continue to struggle, be modest and prudent, learn modestly, push the work of urban people's communes greatly forward, and make these four major upsurges constantly rise on the basis of the people's commune, and strive to accelerate China's socialist construction.

Fellow Representatives and Comrades: When Vice Premier Li Fuchun just announced the exciting news in his report that "various cities in our country are running people's communes in a big way," it immediately aroused the panic and unease of the echo bugs of imperialism. Like our rural people's communes, they have used all kinds of malicious words to fabricate rumors and slander our urban people's communes. However, we clearly know that what imperialism and all reactionaries hate and hate to the bone is exactly what the people of our country have dreamed of for their generations of happiness. Their shameless clamor can only prove that they are trembling in front of the Chinese people who are constantly winning victories under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Agence France-Presse recently said in a report on China's urban people's communes: "What happened in Harbin also happened in all other towns in China." This is indeed true, and there is no need to be surprised. This shows that running urban people's communes in a big way is not only the urgent wish of the broad masses of people in Harbin City, but also the common wish of the broad masses of people in all towns and cities across the country. Like rural people's communes, urban people's communes are the inevitable product of the general line and the great leap forward, the inevitable result of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the inevitable trend of social development. This is something that no one can stop. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the 650 million people of our country will surely hold higher the glorious banner of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, and forge ahead bravely!

Long live the urban people's commune!

专栏：

    城市人民公社万岁
    任仲夷代表介绍哈尔滨市建立城市人民公社的经验各位代表、各位同志：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，人大常务委员会的工作报告。现在我把哈尔滨市建立城市人民公社的情形简要地汇报一下，请批评指正。
    城市人民公社是社会发展的必然产物
    哈尔滨市试办城市人民公社的工作，是从1958年8月下旬开始的。一年多以来，在全市市区共建立了八个人民公社，入社人口一百二十七万多人，占市区总人口的70.6％。一年多来的实践证明，城市人民公社的出现完全不是偶然的，是我国经济和政治发展的必然产物。势在必行，非办不可。
    1958年，哈尔滨市同全国各地一样，是社会主义建设全面发展全面跃进的一年。由于生产的大跃进，迫切要求大力发展协作，尤其是就地在大中小型企业之间组织协作。一方面，组织小型企业为大中型企业服务，发展重点企业的生产；另一方面，又在大中型企业的帮助下，发展小型企业的生产。由于生产的全面大跃进，劳动力紧张的现象也越来越突出。根据1958年生产跃进计划的要求，全市需要补充二十多万工人。这样多的人，不仅农村一下子拿不出来，就是能够拿得出来，也会因为大批人口突然涌入城市，给城市的副食供应、住宅和交通等方面带来极大的困难。动员城市家庭妇女和闲散劳动力就业，参加社会劳动是解决这个问题的重要办法，但是广大家庭妇女的就业，又迫切要求举办各种生活福利事业，把家务劳动社会化。由于区街工业生产和社会生活福利事业的全面发展，原来的区街政权的工作，诸如：卫生、社会救济、调解纠纷以及宣传教育等，有的减少了，有的基本上变成了工厂企业内部的工作，但是管理生产和管理集体生活的工作却比以前大大增加了。
    所有这些问题的出现，都说明城市工作大大发展了，生产关系和上层建筑的某些环节已经不能完全适应生产力和经济基础发展的需要了，必须实行一些必要的改革和调整。在那个时候，由于全民整风运动的伟大胜利和党的社会主义建设总路线的深入人心，人们的思想觉悟空前提高，几乎所有的人都在千方百计地寻找解决上述问题的办法，以加速我国的社会主义建设。例如，有的地方打算把工厂和街道办事处合并起来（如香坊区打算以国营轴承厂等厂为中心组成的“轴承大街”），有的地方由各国营企业组成了“协作委员会”，有的地方由街道工业和街道居民的集体福利单位组成了“生产服务社”……等等。正是在这个时候，党中央和毛主席提出人民公社是加速社会主义建设和在将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义的一个良好形式。于是，我们根据中共中央和中共黑龙江省委的指示，开始了在市区试办人民公社的工作。
    城市人民公社已表现出强大的生命力和无比的优越性
    哈尔滨市试办城市人民公社的实践证明，城市人民公社是在城市中贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的最好的组织形式。尽管它从出世到现在还只有一年多的时间，但是它像农村人民公社一样，已经表现出强大的生命力和无比的优越性，无论在促进经济建设和文化建设方面，或者在组织人民经济生活方面，都起了显著的作用。
    第一、促进了工业生产和建设的全面大发展。一年多来，在所有公社中，无论国营、地方国营或者公社经营的工业生产，都得到了大发展，都实现了大跃进。1959年，全市各人民公社的平均工业产值比大跃进的1958年增长了70％。其中以国营轴承厂为中心建立起来的香坊人民公社，1959年国营和地方国营的工业总产值比1958年增长60％，提前六十二天完成了全年的跃进计划。以国营电机厂、汽轮机厂、锅炉厂为中心建立起来的动力之乡人民公社，1959年国营和地方国营的工业总产值比1958年增长51％，并且早在去年9月就提前三年零三个月，完成了第二个五年计划发电设备的指标。此外，这两个公社的社办工业总产值，也都增长了一倍以上。今年全市公社工业和街道工业总产值预计可达八亿二千多万元，约占去年全市工业总产值的五分之一，相当于解放当时全市工业总产值的二十多倍。
    公社中的各种企业所以能够全面跃进，重要原因就在于在公社的统一领导下，有效地贯彻执行了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，本着“保证重点，带动一般”的精神，有计划地组织了大中小型企业的互相支援和协作。例如哈尔滨轴承厂在1958年根据国家要求必须生产数量很大的轴承，可是辅助性的生产跟不上去，外地的协作关系也有一部分中断了，任务十分紧张。公社党委发动了社内中小工厂的工人予以支援，结果保证轴承厂提前三天完成了国家的生产任务。与此同时，公社的卫星轴承、建新机械、翻砂等中小型工厂，也得到大厂的帮助，获得了很大的发展。例如在国营轴承厂的帮助下，把原来只有几十个人的草绳厂改建为卫星轴承厂，只有一年多的时间，就发展成为一个拥有六十多台机床、六百多工人的工厂，去年年产轴承十万多套，相当于我国解放当时的全国产量，而今年计划生产一百万套，几乎相当于解放当时全国轴承产量的十倍。由于加强了企业之间的共产主义协作，改变了过去那种厂房相连，烟囱相望，机声相闻，而几乎老死不相往来的现象。过去，许多工厂企业的协作关系，几乎遍及全国各地，往往为了一件产品的配套，就要千里迢迢，跑遍全国。但是人民公社建立以后，由于就地组织协作，大大补充了国家所组织的协作的不足，保证了生产上的急需。例如1958年下半年香坊人民公社轴承厂有八台机床因缺“刀杆”将要停工，按过去的协作关系，最快也需要半个月才能解决，但是，由于公社组织社营的机械厂加工，一天就交货了。又如这个社中的轴承厂、轧钢厂和啤酒厂虽然只有一墙之隔，但是因为隶属关系不同（他们分别属于第一机械工业部、市第一工业局和市第二工业局领导），党的关系也不属当地党委领导，过去一直很少来往。组成公社以后，他们的关系立刻发生了变化。还在公社刚刚成立的时候，轧钢厂发现轴承厂生产任务紧张，主动挖掘潜力，帮助他们锻造半成品；轧钢厂因为电源不足影响生产的时候，啤酒厂主动用自己的发电设备给他们送电；啤酒厂的糖化锅牙轮坏了，如果按着过去的常规到别处修理，至少要停产一个月，但经过公社组织协作，轧钢厂工人突击一昼夜就给修好了。再如动力之乡人民公社中的国营汽轮机厂，在中压五万瓩汽轮机即将试车的时候，因为生产任务忙，一个重要部件（涡轮之缘）加工不出来，在动力之乡公社的组织下，林业机械厂宁可暂时停止自己部分生产，突击四昼夜完成任务，保证了五万瓩汽轮机的及时试车。像这样的事例是很多的，社员和工人们把这种就地组织的协作关系叫做“老邻新友”。现在，各个部门之间的协作关系越来越有计划和越有组织了，例如香坊公社每月都召集协作会议，平均每次会议提出的协作问题都不下八、九十件，其中有80％都得到了解决；动力之乡人民公社在去年九个月内就组织了一千六百八十六次协作，解决的问题数以万计。由于人民公社组织的这种协作把社内的大中小型企业，重工业和轻工业，国营、地方国营和公社经营的企业密切地结合起来，互相支援，综合利用，充分挖掘了潜力，既保证了国家重点生产任务的完成，也促进了整个工业生产和建设的全面大跃进。
    第二、促进了农林牧副渔生产的全面大发展。哈尔滨市的香坊、平房、动力之乡、太平、道外等公社，都是联合附近农村组成的既有工业又有农业的人民公社。一年多来，这些公社除了领导工业生产以外，都本着“郊区生产为城市服务”和“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，大力组织了农副业生产，建立了副食品生产基地或者农牧场，并且在遭遇旱、虫、病、雹等严重自然灾害的条件下，获得了六畜兴旺、五谷丰登的全面大丰收。根据全市五个公社的统计，1959年蔬菜产量达到四亿八千七百万斤，比1958年增加一点三倍，到今年2月底养猪十万零三百一十头，比1958年增长二点三倍，养鸡七十七万四千只，比1958年增长一点五倍，新建立了蔬菜温室十六万平方米，仅香坊公社去年就建设了五万平方米的温室，相当于哈尔滨市过去六十年来所建设的温室总面积的一倍多。这不仅进一步发展了农村经济，满足了人民生活的需要，而且还以相当数量的蔬菜支援了兄弟城市，仅香坊人民公社就拿出三百万斤质量最好的蔬菜，支援了首都——北京。
    在发展农副业生产中，各公社不仅组织农村的劳动力，运输工具和副食品支援了城市（据香坊和动力之乡人民公社的统计，去年一年就组织了三万八千多人次的农村劳动力和八千七百多台次的车辆，支援了各工厂企业的生产），并且也都以很大的力量组织了城市对农村特别是近郊区农村的支援。各工厂、企业在公社的统一领导和规划下，本着挖掘企业潜力的精神和等价交换的原则，采取厂区（农业管理区）挂钩的方法，以边材废料为农村制造农具和设备，或者把废旧机械和呆滞物资，拿出来支援农村。如平房公社，由于公社组织城市对农村的支援，截至1959年底，该社农业管理区共建立了机械修配厂、铁工厂、木工厂、化肥厂、制砖厂、粮米加工厂和土壤化肥分析站等五十九个中小型工厂和企业。该社朝阳、平房两个分社，过去连挂马掌都往城里跑，现在有了机械修理厂，不仅能制造一般农具或机械零件，而且可以中修大型农具、拖拉机和汽车。香坊公社的八个农业生产大队，已经有六个大队在抽水、脱谷、铡草等非田间作业方面基本上实现了机械化和电气化。动力之乡人民公社的各个生产管理区，已经全部实现了耕地和运输的机械化或半机械化。在电气化方面，现在全市各个公社都基本上实现了户户有电灯，队队通电话，屯屯有广播。因此有人写诗歌颂道：“人民公社力量大，工农联盟是一家，团结一致亲无比，天大困难也不怕。”这就进一步密切了城乡关系，加强了工农联盟，大大地推进了农业的技术改造。
    第三、促进了妇女的彻底解放，有效地改革了旧社会遗留下来的不合理的生活方式。随着广大家庭妇女参加社会劳动，迫切地要求家务劳动社会化。为了适应这种需要，在建社之初，各公社都本着群众自己动手、白手起家的精神和完全自愿参加的原则，兴办了六千多个公共食堂、九千一百多个托儿所和幼儿园，大大减轻了妇女的家务负担，使她们能够安心生产。正如她们所说的：“幼儿园中幸福多，大小儿童笑呵呵；家长心中甜如蜜，无牵无挂去工作；鼓足干劲争上游，建设美好新生活；感谢党的总路线、培养社会新花朵。”但是，仅仅是这些集体福利事业还远不能满足广大职工群众的需要。于是，在去年年初，群众又创造出来了一种新的适应这种需要的组织——街道服务站，现在全市已经办起来的服务站已达六千五百五十多个。由于街道服务站服务方式灵活，收费低廉，服务范围广泛，从洗衣、缝补、做饭、托儿、照顾病人、代买东西、代订书报、预购戏票、清扫房屋、美化家庭以至婚丧嫁娶等都可办理，受到广大职工群众的热烈欢迎。他（她）们说：过去“早晚两头乱哄哄，每逢假日闹分工，你买煤拌我拆洗，你看孩子我买米，分工不当打唧唧（吵嘴的意思）”，而现在：“服务站，真方便，零星家务有代办；看孩子，买米面，日常生活大改变。”由于广大妇女摆脱家务劳动，参加了生产，增加了收入，学会了生产技术，大大提高了社会地位，并且改变了过去的不合理的生活方式，促进了新型的幸福的家庭关系的发展，加上街道服务站又是一个带有群众性的互助组织，还大大促进了人们的集体主义观念和共产主义道德品质的成长。现在，舍私为公、助人为乐、相互关心、义务劳动的风气大为发扬。家庭和睦，邻里团结的新人新事层出不穷。许多职工上班的时候把钥匙交给服务站，让他们代为清扫房屋、美化家庭。不少职工并且把工薪交给服务站，委托他们代为计划家庭开支。服务站成了群众最信任的管家人。过去那种“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”的自私心理已经大为改变，人与人之间的关系更加密切了。
    第四、促进了文化教育和科学技术高速度的发展。广大群众普遍地参加了社会劳动以后，迫切要求提高政治、技术和文化水平。而由于公社全面安排了生活，又为学习政治、技术和文化创造了前所未有的有利条件。一年多来，各公社都举办了大量的业余学校，今年有三十个工厂企业建立了全日制的大学，个别工厂并且试行了六小时劳动、四小时学习的半工半读的制度。一年来，全市各公社参加各种学习的人数都有很大增长。例如，香坊公社增长了六点七倍，动力之乡公社增长了十倍。现在广大社员不仅在脱盲的基础上积极参加了各种文化学习，而且还努力掌握尖端技术，攀登科学高峰。在国家科学研究机关的帮助下，各公社建立了包括电机、焊接、仪器、仪表、化工等方面的科学研究组织。并且创造了优异的成绩。例如香坊人民公社的一个由浴室改造成的小小化工实验厂，大闹技术革命，彻底改变了生产醋酸乙脂的工艺方法，节省了庞大而复杂的蒸馏设备，提高效率六百三十倍。此外，由于公社合理地利用社内的各种文化娱乐场所和设备，大大促进了群众的文化娱乐活动。所有这一些，都为进一步发展技术革命和文化革命创造了极为有利的条件。
    第五、除上述各点以外，由于城市人民公社的建立，在发扬人民民主，进一步加强无产阶级专政，增强人民内部的团结，促进社会主义改造等方面也都起了很大的作用。
    早在1958年12月中共八届六次全会就指出，“城市中的人民公社，将来也会以适合城市特点的形式，成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者，成为工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织”。一年来我们试办城市人民公社的实践证明，这些指示是完全适合哈尔滨市情况的，是完全正确的。尽管现在的人民公社还不够完备，但是从上述事实中可以明白地看出，它正在迅速地朝着日益健全的方向发展。我们完全相信，随着它的不断地巩固、提高和发展，在不断发展社会生产力和提高人们思想觉悟方面，在逐步缩小以至消灭城乡之间、工农之间、体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别方面，一定还会发挥更伟大的作用。
    目前，哈尔滨市的形势极为良好，试办城市人民公社的工作已经进入新阶段，一个大办城市人民公社运动的新高潮已经在全市范围内出现了。我们决心根据中共中央和中共黑龙江省委的指示，继续本着“既积极而又慎重”的方针，全面加强领导，积极地不断地促进城市人民公社的巩固、提高和发展，充分发挥它的优越性，促进整个国民经济的全面跃进，促进整个社会面貌的迅速改变。
    人民公社大大提高了城市人民的组织程度
    人民公社的最大优越性在于大大地提高了城市的组织程度。组织就是力量。不断地提高一切工作的组织性，就会产生新的巨大的力量。因此，我们准备在全市所有已经建立和正在建立公社的地方，都按照公社的特点，加强生产、生活和教育工作的组织性。具体说来就是要在所有公社中建立和健全四个“网”。
    第一个“网”，是生产协作“网”。例如在工业方面，要在“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，以大型企业为骨干，把大中小型企业密切结合起来，广泛开展共产主义大协作。通过这种协作，除了首先保证完成和超额完成国家计划以外，公社还要举办一些对于加速国民经济的全面发展和对于巩固公社具有决定意义的工厂企业。现在，有的公社要办化学厂、日用品厂，有的要办小型的内燃机厂、发电机厂、汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、三轮汽车厂，还有的要办为尖端技术服务的电子管厂和无线电厂等。据全市七个公社的统计，今年都将采取群众路线，土洋结合，遍地开花的办法，建立各种小型企业三千六百五十多个，已经建成并投入生产的有二千三百零六个；仅仅是正在准备建社的南岗区，今年就要建立五百个无线电工厂，最近已经建立起来了二百零六个。还有一些公社正在以公社为单位，积极实现“五环”，即“环形供电”、“环形供水”、“环形供蒸气”、“环形供煤气”和“环形运输”。“五环”是共产主义大协作的重大发展。实现“五环”，必将产生巨大的经济效果。根据全市七十个环形供电点，由于实现了“四合一”环形供电，共拆除变压器五百八十一台，各种规格电线二十万米，电缆线七千米，电柱六百四十多根和其他大量供电设备，同时预计全年可节约一千二百万度电，能够解决一百七十五个单位供电不足的问题。
    第二个“网”，是人民经济生活网。首先是要使近郊区的副食品生产进一步基地化。在这方面，各公社都制定了宏伟的规划，如：建设十万平方米温室、一万平方米菜窖、一万平方米蘑菇室、一万平方米冷库、百万个盆种菜、万鸡山、万鸭湾、万猪场、万亩万斤蔬菜试验田等等。实现这些计划是完全可能的，而且这些计划的实现，必将把哈尔滨市副食品生产提高到一个新的水平，副食品供应量将会大大提高。其次，是要更全面地组织人民的经济生活，以国营商业为骨干，把国营商业、服务业同工厂、学校、机关的福利事业以及街道的服务事业密切结合起来。各个公社现在正在积极兴建公共宿舍，新居民点，积极发展城市建设，并且本着群众自己动手，各方面密切协作，国家积极帮助，完全自觉自愿的原则，为尽快实现“四化”，即托儿化、食堂化、服务站网点化、职工住宅合理化而努力。
    第三个“网”，是文化教育网。要在“一主二从三结合”的方针指导下，以国家举办的正规学校和文艺团体为骨干，把国家举办的和公社、企业、机关等举办的各级各类学校以及其他文化艺术组织密切结合起来，广泛组织职工群众学习政治、文化和技术。现在各公社已经或者正在积极建立正规或业余大学，并且正在普遍建立各种初等和中等业余学校以及各种文艺团体。随着文化教育网的形成和发展，人们的文化生活将会进一步大大活跃起来。
    第四个“网”是科学技术网。在“一主二从三结合”的方针指导下，以国家的科学研究机关为骨干，把国家科学研究机关和工厂、企业、学校、机关的科学研究力量结合起来，广泛开展科学技术活动。现在各公社正在根据这个精神普遍建立科学研究组织，预计到年底，在七个公社中，即可建立机械加工、电机等研究所（站）一百七十多个，各种科学研究小组一千六百多个，参加科学研究活动的可达二万人。这对于促进工业生产向高大精尖新的方向发展，对于加速农业的技术改造，对于高速度地培养和建立科学技术队伍，都将发挥重要的作用。
    “网”和“环”是进一步组织起来的意思。进一步组织起来，当然还不只是做这几方面的工作，在其它方面，也要采取适当的形式，进一步挖掘潜在力量。我们相信，经过这些工作，将使城市的组织程度大大提高，使社会主义建设速度大大加快，使人们精神面貌更加改变，使共产主义因素更多地增长起来。
    人民公社带来了社会主义建设的新高潮
    哈尔滨市试办城市人民公社的工作，在中共中央和中共黑龙江省委的领导下，由于全市人民的积极努力，已经取得了一些成绩和经验。目前哈尔滨市已经出现了一个波澜壮阔的社会主义建设新高潮。在这个高潮中，包含着：以学习毛泽东同志的著作为中心的学习马克思列宁主义的新高潮，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命新高潮，以普及提高全民教育、攀登科学高峰为中心的文化革命新高潮，以发展集体福利事业为中心的全面组织经济文化生活的新高潮。这四大运动的汇合，形成了一股巨大的革命洪流，猛烈地冲刷着旧社会遗留下来的斑痕，有力地推动着社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展。我们决心在毛泽东思想的指导下，高举人民公社的光荣旗帜，遵循这次大会的精神，鼓足干劲，继续奋斗，谦虚谨慎，虚心学习，把城市人民公社工作大大向前推进一步，使这四大高潮在人民公社的基础上不断高涨，为加速我国的社会主义建设而奋斗。
    各位代表和各位同志们：当李富春副总理在他的报告中刚刚宣布了现在我国
    “各城市正在大办人民公社”的振奋人心的消息以后，就立即引起了帝国主义的应声虫们的惊慌和不安。他们像对我国农村人民公社一样，对我国城市人民公社也用尽一切恶毒的字眼进行造谣和污蔑。但是，我们清楚地知道，帝国主义和一切反动派所仇视和恨之入骨的东西，恰恰是我国人民为着自己的世代幸福，梦寐以求的东西。他们的无耻叫嚣只能证明，他们在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下不断取得胜利的中国人民面前，浑身发抖罢了。法新社最近在一则报道中国城市人民公社的消息里说：“哈尔滨所发生的事情在中国所有其它城镇也发生了。”这的确是千真万确的事情，用不着大惊小怪。这说明大办城市人民公社，不仅是哈尔滨市广大人民的迫切愿望，而且也是全国所有城镇的广大人民的共同愿望。像农村人民公社一样，城市人民公社也是总路线、大跃进的必然产物，是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的必然结果和社会发展的必然趋势。这是任何人都阻挡不了的。我国六亿五千万人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，必将更高地举起总路线，大跃进，人民公社的光辉旗帜，奋勇前进！
    城市人民公社万岁！
