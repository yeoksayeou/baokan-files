Technical Innovation Guarantees Monthly Production Success in the First Quarter
Speech by Representative Liu Baozhong

Respected leaders, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them. Now I would like to briefly speak on my factory's efforts in vigorously carrying out the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution.

Our country's continuous Great Leap Forward over the past two years has brought socialist construction into a new stage. Following the Party's general line for socialist construction and the "walking on two legs" policy, the workers and staff of my factory are in high spirits and full of energy. With an incomparably strong sense of responsibility as masters of the working class, we continue to hold high the red flag of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. Under the guidance of the idea of continuous revolution, we have launched a new upsurge of the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution in a broad and deep manner. Inventions and creations are emerging one after another, and production plans are changing rapidly. It has become a mass movement of ideological and technological transformation. Now my factory is moving in the direction of changing the current enterprise management and is developing towards a new type of modern enterprise.

We adopt the method of acting, planning, and implementing simultaneously, paying attention to both long-term planning and the realization of phased goals. Starting from November 1959, through a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, and based on the characteristics of chemical production—high temperature, high pressure, strong continuity, complex chemical reactions and technical operations, and mostly enclosed equipment—we proposed 275 technical innovation projects. As of March 1960, 181 projects have been completed, giving the production landscape a completely new look. We have basically achieved continuous process flow, pipeline transport of liquids, mechanized packaging and transport, enclosed toxic gas and dust, mechanized loading and unloading, and high-speed product drying, and gradually transitioned from quantitative to qualitative change. Fifteen processes have changed the phenomena of high labor intensity, poor labor environment, and insufficient connection between production processes, basically forming a production "dragon." In terms of transportation, we have adopted the same large-scale battle approach as in production, realizing gantry cranes, automatic loading and unloading booms for automobiles, and belt conveyors, increasing the degree of mechanization in transportation from 27.4% to 99.2%, and eliminating heavy manual labor such as carrying, shouldering, and lifting. From the work of technical innovation and technical revolution, we deeply feel that it is a revolutionary measure for increasing production and practicing economy. It not only improves the technical level of workers and staff, greatly reduces labor intensity, and significantly increases labor productivity, but also saves more than 300 laborers, supplementing the insufficient labor force in production development, and increasing the degree of mechanization in production from the original 46.87% to 62.07%. At the same time, it directly promoted the early completion of the annual national plan sixteen days ahead of schedule in 1959, achieving a "full house red," and promoted the "red start" in the first quarter of 1960. The total industrial output value in the first quarter increased by 6.8% according to the plan, labor productivity increased by 8.16%, and the value of increased production and savings reached 2.19 million yuan, completing the first quarter's task nearly six days ahead of schedule.

In the campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution, we first insisted on launching a mass movement, giving full play to the unparalleled wisdom and revolutionary drive of the workers and staff. Technical research organizations have formed a vertical and horizontal network, and new experiences are constantly being developed. Mass technical research institutes and "three-way combination" technical research groups have been set up in all corners, strengthening research activities and breaking through weak links in production one by one. For example, in the past, mineral crushing was entirely done by manual hammering, which used a lot of labor and had high labor intensity. In particular, the crushing of raw materials was not adapted to the production of mechanized small blast furnaces. To change this unsuitable mode of production, manual labor must be replaced by machinery. After the workers and staff fought day and night, and cooperated with each other, they finally realized crushers and transport conveyors, further liberating the productive forces. This single item saved 100 laborers. In the reform, we combined invention and creation with learning and promoting advanced experiences, continuously improving and gradually advancing. For example, a carpenter created a planing machine that could plane four sides, but it was still insufficient in the major capital construction production tasks. There was only one way: we had to improve the equipment to increase mechanical efficiency. Therefore, the masses worked hard to improve the gears, which could plane eight sides, especially for making windows and doors, which could be shaped in one planing, increasing work efficiency by 56 times. The larger the production task, the more motivated the workers and staff. The more motivated, the more they tried to innovate. For example, the double-drum crystallizer used for DDT crystallization required six to seven people to manually stir around the crystallization tank every day before it was put into production. To completely change the crystallization method, mechanized operation must be implemented. The group's workers fought hard for three days and nights, improved the equipment, and also changed the product packaging and transportation to conveyors, so that DDT production improved the working environment and became a relatively complete mechanized system. The worker comrades said that fighting hard for a few days and nights is temporary hard work, and long-term happiness is realized after mechanization. Therefore, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a strong desire of the working class.

Second, we adhere to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, self-reliance, and the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy. In most of the mechanized projects that have been realized, we have not applied to higher authorities for materials, but have fully tapped internal potential, and organized construction based on the spirit of economical and practical, indigenous first and foreign later, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Thanks to the Party's long-term cultivation and education, the masses already possess the communist ideological style of clearing warehouses everywhere and everyone contributing ideas and treasures. Old materials are never used if new materials are available, and substitutes must be found if materials are not available. For example, the thiourea dryer was made entirely of old trough plates, and the wheels were made of wood, with iron sheets wrapped around them to protect the shell. This indigenous machine plays a great role, shortening auxiliary time and increasing drying capacity by more than 30%. Another example is acid transportation, which is one of the key points in production. Manual acid transportation requires more than 50 people every day, which is both a waste of labor and unsafe. Therefore, when realizing tank car acid transportation, the 200-meter-long pipeline was all made of old rubber hoses, glass tubes, and wooden frames, made in spare time. Although it still needs to be gradually improved to the "foreign" method, the current problem has been solved. This indigenous pipeline has a very significant effect, improving the working environment, saving 40 laborers, and strongly cooperating with the in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Now the handling of suggestions is as follows: projects that can be realized by the work section are not submitted to the workshop, and projects that can be handled in the workshop are not submitted to the factory. Major projects are handled by the factory in a unified and balanced manner. This reduces the handling levels and accelerates the progress of realization. Under the encouragement of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance, the broad masses pay attention to saving every bit, actively recycle and utilize waste gas and waste materials, and conduct scientific research. At present, more than a dozen new products have been successfully trial-produced or put into production, such as insecticides, ethylene glycol, 99% thiourea, perchloroethylene, and vinylidene chloride, supporting the needs of the country's ever-developing economy.

Third, in the process of mechanization and semi-mechanization, the broad masses of workers and staff have given full play to their skillful spirit. Old worker Tian Shugong, based on the heavy manual labor of blast furnace workers loading materials, painstakingly researched and created automatic loading, which improved production capacity and saved seven people every day. Packaging container workers created a box-stapling machine, which changed manual operation and increased work efficiency by more than six times. The workers and staff are very keen in their work and delve deeper and deeper. For example, the DDT condensation group that attended the National Congress of Heroes, because of the improvement of mechanization and automation control, reduced the auxiliary time in production by automatically measuring specific gravity, and increased the daily output without increasing equipment, from 12.5 tons in the past to 14.5 tons, which can increase production and save 2,824,400 yuan for the country throughout the year. Because the mechanization movement is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it is further clarified that it is an inevitable trend to accelerate socialist construction. Therefore, in just five months, a total of 8,902 innovation suggestions were put forward, of which 2,078 have been adopted and 865 have been realized. Among them, a major technological reform has been realized, from spiral collectors to smoke-water mixers, basically eliminating the coal smoke from the boiler room, which laid a good foundation for comprehensive utilization and further elimination of coal smoke.

From the above many facts, it shows that the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution is the inevitable product of our people's adherence to and implementation of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. It is the result of our holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to the mass movement. Although we have achieved some results, we are still far from meeting the needs of the Party and socialist construction. We will take advantage of the favorable situation of continuous leaps forward, use and develop the gained experience, move towards new goals, carry forward the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, set high ambitions, and hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, march towards high-tech, precision, and cutting-edge technology, and push the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to a higher peak. In April, we will conscientiously carry out the "six modernizations and three no's" activities. "Six modernizations" are to further realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, continuity, and pipelining; "three no's" are no waste gas, no waste materials, and no waste water. We will also realize 37 new projects, and strengthen technical transformation, increase the transformation of electrolytic cells, use modern technology, put immersion evaporation and foam drying equipment into production, improve the capacity of existing production equipment, and increase the daily output of the main product of burnt gangue from 130 tons to 160 tons before "May Day," and correspondingly increase all chlorine products, to offer a gift to "May Day" International Labor Day. We will strive to increase the mechanization level of our factory to more than 95% in 1960, and realize two automated workshops and two automated work sections. In terms of new technologies, we will expand research institutions, increase new varieties, and expand the output of existing products, aiming to increase the total industrial output value by 37.5% to 50% or more by the end of 1960, to forge ahead bravely for a better and more comprehensive leap forward.

    技术革新保证了首季月月红
    刘宝忠代表的发言各位领导，全体代表同志们：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告，并保证坚决贯彻执行。现在谨就我厂在大搞以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动方面做一简要发言。
    我国两年来的连续大跃进，使社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的阶段，我厂职工遵循着党的社会主义总路线的一套“两条腿走路”的方针，精神振奋，干劲冲天，以无比强大的工人阶级的主人翁责任感，继续高举总路线、大跃进的红旗，在不断革命的思想指导下，广泛深入地掀起了以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动新高潮，发明创造层出不穷，生产计划日新月异，它已成为一项群众性的思想改造和技术改造的运动，现在我厂正朝着前进的方向，改变着现在的企业管理面貌，并正向新型的、现代化的企业发展着。
    我们采用边行动边规划边实现的方法，既注意了长期规划，又高度重视分期实现。从1959年11月份起，经过自上而下，自下而上的结合，根据化工生产的高温、高压、连续性强、化学反应和技术操作复杂、设备多是密化的特点，提出了二百七十五项技术革新课题。截至1960年3月份，已实现一百八十一项，使生产面貌焕然一新，基本上达到了工艺流程连续化，液体输送管道化，包装运输机械化，毒气粉尘密闭化，装卸杠杆化，产品干燥高速化，生产控制仪表化。逐步地由量变到质变，使十五道工序改变了劳动强度高、劳动环境差和生产工序之间不够衔接的现象，基本上形成了生产一条龙。在交通运输方面也与生产一样，以大兵团作战形式，实现了起重少先吊、龙门吊、汽车自动装卸吊杆和皮带运输机等，使运输机械化程度由27.4％提高到99.2％，消灭了扛、背、抬等笨重体力劳动。从技术革新和技术革命的工作中，深深感到它是增产节约的一项革命措施，不仅提高了职工技术水平，大大减轻劳动程度，显著的提高劳动生产率，节省了三百多名劳动力，充实了生产发展中的部分劳动力不足，使生产上的机械化程度由原来46.87％提高到62.07％。同时更直接的促进了1959年提前十六天超额完成全年国家计划，实现了满堂红，并促进了1960年首季开门红，第一季工业总产值照计划提高6.8％，劳动生产率提高8.16％，增产节约的价值达二百一十九万元，提前近六天完成了首季任务。
    在技术革新、技术革命的运动中，首先坚持了大搞群众运动，广泛地发挥了职工群众的无比智慧和革命的干劲，技术研究组织已经纵横成网，新的经验不断地成龙配套。各角落都设有群众性的技术研究设计院和“三结合”技术研究小组，针对生产上的薄弱环节，加强研究活动，逐个击破。如矿石粉碎，过去完全用人工打砸，劳动力使用得多，劳动强度也高，尤其是原料的破碎与机械化的小高炉生产不相适应，改变这种不适应的生产方式，必须以机械来代替手工劳动。经过职工夜以继日奋战，互相协作，终于实现了粉碎机和运输传动机，进一步解放了生产力，仅这一项节省人工一百名。在改革中又以发明创造和学习推广先进经验相结合，不断改进，循序渐进，如木工创造了刨木机，能刨四面，但在重大的基建生产任务中更感不足，方法只有一条，必须改进设备提高机械效能，因此群众苦心钻研，改进了齿轮，能刨八面，特别是做窗户和门，一刨成型，提高工作效率五十六倍。生产任务越大，职工干劲越足，干劲越足越设法革新，如滴滴涕结晶用的双滚筒结晶器，在没投入生产前，每天都
  有六至七人围绕结晶槽进行人工搅拌。要彻底改变结晶方法，必须实行机械化操作，小组职工苦战了三昼夜，改进了设备，并且将产品包装运输一并改为运输机，使滴滴涕生产改善了劳动环境，成为一套比较完善的机械化体系。工人同志们说，奋战几昼夜是暂时的辛苦，实现机械化后是长期的快活。因此技术革新、技术革命运动是工人阶级具有的强烈愿望。
    第二，坚持土洋结合、自力更生，贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。在已实现的机械化项目中，绝大部分没有向上级申请材料，充分挖掘了内部潜力，本着经济适用先土后洋、土洋并举的精神组织施工。由于党的长期培养教育，群众中已具备了处处清仓，人人献计献宝的共产主义思想风格，有旧料绝不使用新料，没有料也要找到代用，如硫脲干燥机，完全用旧槽板制成的，轮子是用木质的，为了保护外壳用铁皮包起来，这个土法机器作用很大，缩短了辅助时间，提高干燥能力30％以上。再如生产关键之一是运酸工作，用人工运酸每天需用五十多人，既浪费劳动力，又不安全，因此实现槽车运酸时二百米长度的管路全部利用旧胶管、玻璃管和木架，利用业余时间做成的，虽然还要逐步向“洋”法方面改进，但当前的问题已经解决，这条土法管路效果非常显著，改善了劳动环境，节省了四十名劳动力，有力地配合了增产节约运动的深入开展。现在对建议的处理是：工段能实现的项目不交车间，车间里能办到的不到厂部，对重大的项目由厂部统一平衡处理，这样就减少了处理层次，加速了实现的进度。在土洋结合、自力更生的方针鼓舞下，广大群众注意点滴节约，积极回收利用废气、废物，进行科学研究，目前已试制成功或投入生产上的有新产品达十余种，如杀虫剂、乙二醇、99％硫脲、过氯乙烯、偏氯乙烯等，支援了国家经济日益发展的需要。
    第三，在机械化、半机械化过程中，广大职工发挥了巧干精神。老工人田树功，根据高炉工人上料的繁重体力劳动，经过苦心钻研，创造了自动上料，提高了生产能力，每天节省七个人。包装容器工人创造了订箱机，改变了手工操作，提高工作效率六倍以上。在工作中职工钻劲很大，越钻越深，如出席全国群英会的滴滴涕缩合小组，因为机械化和自动化控制程度的提高，以自动测比重的方法，减少了生产上的辅助时间，在不增加设备的基础上，提高了日产量，由过去日产十二点五吨，提高到十四点五吨，全年可为国家增产节约二百八十二万四千元。由于机械化运动的深入人心，进一步明确了它是加速社会主义建设的必然趋势，因此，仅五个月的时间共提出八千九百零二件革新建议，已被采纳的达二千零七十八件，已实现的八百六十五件，其中实现了一项重大的技术改革，从螺旋式捕集器，发展到烟水混合器，基本上消灭了锅炉房的煤烟子，这给综合利用工作和进一步消灭煤烟子打下良好的基础。
    从以上许多事实表明，以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动是我国人民坚持贯彻执行总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物，是我们高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持大搞群众运动的结果。我们虽然获得一些成绩，但距离党和社会主义建设的需要还相差很远。我们乘继续不断跃进的有利形势，运用与发展既得的经验，朝着新的目标前进，发扬勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的精神，树雄心，立大志，高举毛泽东思想红旗，向高、精、尖进军，将技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约的运动，推向更高的顶峰，在4月份认真开展“六化三无”活动。“六化”是进一步实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、连续化、管道化；“三无”是无废气、无废物、无废水，并再实现三十七项新项目，同时加强技术改造，增加电解槽的改造，使用现代化的技术，将浸沫式蒸发和泡沫干燥设备投入生产，提高现有生产设备能力，将主要产品烧矸的日产量，在“五一”前由一百三十吨提高到一百六十吨，相应地增加所有氯气产品，向“五一”国际劳动节献礼。争取在1960年内把我厂的机械化水平提高到95％以上，并实现两个自动化车间和两个自动化工段，在新工艺方面，针对薄弱环节，扩大研究机构，增加新品种，扩大现有产品产量，到1960年底，使工业总产值比1959年提高37.5％至50％以上，为更好更全面的跃进奋勇前进。
