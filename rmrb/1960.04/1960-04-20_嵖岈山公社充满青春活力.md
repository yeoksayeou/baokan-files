The Chayashan Commune is Full of Youthful Vitality
Guanghui's Second Anniversary
Compared with before communization: Grain production has more than doubled, the net income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has increased sixfold, commune-run industries have greatly developed, and the net income of commune members has increased by more than doubled.
Zhengzhou, April 19 (reported by this newspaper) The Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan, the first to establish a commune organization, has demonstrated strong vitality over the past two years. This year's spring production has reached a high speed and high standard of early, meticulous, fast, and good.
At present, the Chayashan area presents a great situation. Ninety thousand mu of wheat fields are lush and green, with wheat seedlings reaching over a foot tall, better than any previous year. Preparations for plowing began more than a month earlier than in previous years. The first batch of leap-forward seeds such as rice and cotton has now been sown, and the area of spring-sown crops will be expanded by 30% compared with last year. The acreage of high-yield crops such as rice and corn has been greatly increased compared with last year. The 21,300 mu of wasteland that has been reclaimed has been planted with a large number of early spring vegetables. The 27,860+ mu of forest and 7,860,000+ scattered trees planted around the Spring Festival have a survival rate of over 90% and have now begun to sprout. Diversified operations are even more booming. According to statistics at the end of last month, a plan for total income of more than one million yuan has been completed, averaging more than 20 yuan per person. The production speed of commune-run industries is also particularly fast. The first quarter's output value task of 3.8 million yuan was completed 18 days ahead of schedule.
The Chayashan People's Commune was established on April 20, 1958. From the first day of its establishment, various productions were like adding wings to a tiger. Last year, despite experiencing a severe drought unseen in decades, it still achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industrial production. Grain yield reached 438 jin per mu, more than double that of 1957 before the establishment of the commune, and more than 20% higher than the bumper year of 1958. The net income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries increased more than six times compared with 1957 before the establishment of the commune. The number of pigs increased from 3,000 at the beginning of the commune's establishment to more than 30,000. Commune-run industry was still a blank sheet before communization. In 1959, it already had 34 factories producing agricultural machinery, fertilizers, machine-made paper, and textiles. There were only four large agricultural machines before communization. Now, the number of tractors alone has increased to 18, plus more than 10 sets of loco-mobile engines, gas engines, harvesters, and diesel engines. With the development of production, more than 90% of the commune members increased their income last year, with the average net income increasing by more than double from a maximum of 36 yuan per person before communization. The 436 public canteens, which are getting better and better, have become a strong base for consolidating the people's commune system and are warm families for the commune members. The 279 homes for the elderly, kindergartens, and nurseries have become happy paradises for the elderly and children.
The entire members of the Chayashan People's Commune have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution. As early as the beginning of this year, the vast members, through summarizing last year's harvest experience, formulated this year's plan for continued leap forward. Grain yield will increase by 30% on the basis of last year, cotton will increase by 28%, oil crops will increase by 25%, the total industrial income will increase by 1.5 times compared with last year, and the total output value of diversified operations will increase by 36% compared with last year. In order to realize the above plan, this year's various production increase measures centered on water, fertilizer, and soil have been implemented more practically and reliably than any previous year, and the masses are working with soaring enthusiasm.
The 6,000 civilian laborers who participated in water conservancy construction, while braving the severe cold of winter to build reservoirs and channels, vigorously developed machine-operated wells to tap underground water sources, so that more than 90% of the commune's arable land has surface water irrigation, and 30,000 mu of arable land has achieved "double insurance" of well-channel irrigation.
In order to increase more high-quality fertilizer, while vigorously developing pig raising, the commune concentrated on building 20 fertilizer factories to produce high-quality fertilizer, with an average of 30 jin of fertilizer per mu of arable land. In addition, it also put forward the requirements of "water fertilizer ashore, mountain fertilizer down the mountain, farm (livestock farm) fertilizer out of the farm, and miscellaneous fertilizer into the fields" to all commune members, accumulating more than 1.8 billion jin of various miscellaneous fertilizers. Due to the large amount of fertilizer, all wheat fields in the commune this year have been topdressed two to four times, and each mu of spring land has been fully fertilized with more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer. A large amount of topdressing and base fertilizer has also been prepared for spring-sown crops and small autumn land. More than 17,000 mu of spring-sown land has been universally deep-plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot by four methods: tractors, deep-plowing plows, manual labor, and tandem plows. The area of mechanized farming has reached more than 60%. It has basically achieved deep plowing and fine harrowing, with broken and leveled soil.
The tool reform movement, which has developed from individual to complete sets, from agricultural tool improvement to semi-mechanization and mechanization, has shown a new situation. At present, more than 76,900 pieces of agricultural tools for harvesting, transportation, plowing, harrowing, deep plowing, and sowing have been reformed. The main processes of agricultural production have realized semi-mechanized or mechanized operation. Many reformed tools have increased efficiency by several times to a dozen times. Various corresponding measures have also been taken in the selection of excellent varieties and the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests.
In order to organize this year's balanced production increase, at the beginning of the preparation for plowing activities, the commune helped the poor teams with poor foundations to quickly change their outlook in all aspects. In addition to dispatching cadres to strengthen the leadership of the poor teams, the commune also provided 50,000 yuan in funds, 80,000 jin of fertilizer, and 50,000 jin of pesticides to support these teams in developing production during spring production, and sent tractors to give priority to plowing 3,100 mu of spring-sown land for the Daying and Daliwang teams with less labor, more land, and weak animal power. The spirit of "catching up" and "helping" between the rich and the poor, the advanced and the backward, and the low-yield and high-yield areas has become a common practice. When the members of the rich Baozhuang Brigade heard that the Wangzhuang Brigade lacked technical strength in manufacturing local fertilizer, they immediately dispatched eight technicians to provide support. In just half a month, they produced 100,000 jin of local fertilizer. In order to help the Daliwang team do a good job in production and jointly leap forward, the Hanlou, Changhan, and Tushan Brigades jointly planned a 10,000-mu high-yield square to cooperate in labor, tools, technology, and other aspects.

    嵖岈山公社充满青春活力
    光辉的两周年
    和公社化前相比：粮食增产一倍多，林牧副渔纯收入增长六倍，社办工业大有发展，社员纯收入增长一倍多。
    本报郑州19日电　河南最早建成公社组织的遂平县嵖岈山人民公社，两年来，显示了强大的生命力，今年春季生产更达到了早、细、快、好的高速度高标准。
    目前，展现在人们面前的嵖岈山区是一派大好形势。九万亩麦田一遍青葱，麦苗高达一尺多，较任何一年为好。备耕工作较往年提前一个多月，现已播下第一批水稻、棉花等跃进种子，春播作物面积将比去年扩大30％，水稻、玉米等高产作物都较去年增种很多。开垦的二万一千三百亩荒地，种植了大量的早春蔬菜。春节前后营造的二万七千八百六十多亩成片林和七百八十多万株零星树木，成活率高达90％以上，现已开始发叶。多种经营更是一片红火，据上月底统计，已完成总收入一百余万元的计划，每人平均在二十元以上。社办工业的生产速度也特别快，第一季度三百八十万元的产值任务，提前十八天就完成了。
    嵖岈山人民公社是1958年4月20日建成的。从建社的第一天起，各项生产就如虎添翼。去年虽遭到了几十年来未有的严重干旱，仍然取得了农林牧副渔和工业生产的全面跃进。粮食单产达到四百三十八斤，比建社前的1957年增长一倍多，比大丰收的1958年增长两成以上。林牧副渔的纯收入比建社前的1957年增长六倍以上。猪由公社初建时的三千头发展到三万多头。社办工业在公社化前还是一张白纸，1959年已拥有农业机械、化肥生产、机制纸、纺织等三十四个工厂。大型的农业机械在公社化前只有四部，现在光拖拉机就增加到十八部，还有锅驼机、煤气机、收割机、柴油机等十多部。随着生产的发展，去年90％以上的社员都增加了收入，纯收入较公社化前每人最高平均达到三十六元提高了一倍以上。越办越好的四百三十六个公共食堂，成了巩固人民公社制度的坚强阵地，是社员温暖的大家庭。二百七十九座敬老院、幼儿园、托儿组织，更变成了老人和儿童的康福乐园。
    嵖岈山人民公社的全体社员，发扬了不断革命的精神，早在今年初广大社员通过总结去年的丰收经验，就制订了今年的继续跃进规划。粮食单产要在去年基础上增加30％，棉花增长28％，油料增长25％，工业总收入比去年增长一点五倍，多种经营总产值比去年提高36％。为了实现上述规划，今年以水、肥、土为中心的各项增产措施，都贯彻得比任何一年踏实牢靠，群众干劲冲天。
    参加修水利的六千民工，一面冒着隆冬数九的严寒修建水库渠道，一面大搞机井方，挖掘地下水源，使全社90％以上的耕地有了地上水灌溉，并使三万亩耕地达到了井渠灌溉“双保险”。
    为了增加更多的优质肥，公社在大力发展养猪生产的同时，突击建成了二十座化肥厂生产优质化肥，每亩耕地平均有三十斤化肥。此外还向全体社员提出“水肥上岸，山肥下山，场（畜牧场）肥出场，杂肥下田”的要求，积各种杂肥十八亿多斤。由于肥料多，今年全社的所有麦田都施追肥二至四遍，每亩春地施足底肥一万斤以上。还为春播作物地和小秋地准备了大量的追肥和底肥。一万七千多亩春播地，都采取用拖拉机、深翻犁、人工、套犁等四种办法，普遍深翻八寸到一尺，机耕面积达到60％以上。基本上作到了犁深耙细、土碎平整。
    由单个到成套，由农具改良向着半机械化、机械化方向发展的工具改革运动，出现了崭新的局面。现在，已改革收割、运输、犁耙、深翻、播种等各种农具七万六千九百多件。农业生产的主要工序，都实现了半机械化或机械化的操作。许多经过改革的工具，都是几倍到十几倍的提高工效。在选用优良品种、防治病虫害等各方面，也都采取了各种相应的措施。
    为了组织今年的平衡增产，备耕活动一开始，公社就从各方面帮助基础差的穷队迅速改变面貌。公社除派遣干部加强了穷队的领导外，还在春季生产中，拿出资金五万元、化肥八万斤、农药五万斤，支援这些队发展生产，并派出拖拉机为劳力少、土地多、畜力弱的大营、大里王队优先耕春播地三千一百多亩。富和穷、先进与落后、低产和高产地区之间的“赶”“帮”精神蔚然成风。富队鲍庄大队的社员听说王庄队在制造土化肥上缺乏技术力量，立即派出八名技术员予以支援，只半月光景，就生产土化肥十万斤。韩楼、常韩、土山等大队为了帮助大里王队搞好生产共同跃进，他们统一规划了万亩丰产方，以便在劳力、工具、技术等各方面进行协作。（附图片）
