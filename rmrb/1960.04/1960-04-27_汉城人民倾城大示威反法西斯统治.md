Seoul Residents' Citywide Demonstration Against Fascist Rule
Syngman Rhee's Situation Extremely Isolated, Forced to Express "Willingness" to Resign, U.S. Intensifies Two-Faced Tactics to Maintain Colonial Rule
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th. Seoul News: The people of South Korea, with soaring fighting spirit, are fighting stronger and stronger. Following more than half a month of continuous demonstrations, the people of Seoul today launched another magnificent citywide demonstration, redoubling their efforts to fiercely attack the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, tottering under the support of American bayonets.

According to Reuters, a total of 500,000 people in Seoul today participated in demonstrations against the fascist rule of the U.S.-Rhee group. They shouted slogans such as "Syngman Rhee get out of power," "Lee Ki-bung deserves to die," "Avenge the blood of the students," and "Give me liberty or give me death." They surrounded Syngman Rhee's residence, dragged the dismantled bronze statue of Syngman Rhee on the street, spitting and throwing stones at it. All the streets in Seoul were filled with angry crowds, and countless people from the suburbs of Yeongdeungpo and other places traveled by car or on foot to Seoul. Syngman Rhee sent a large number of troops and tanks to shoot at the demonstrators and release tear gas. However, surrounded by the demonstrators, the tanks sent by the Syngman Rhee group to suppress them were completely unable to move. Dozens of people on each tank shouted slogans to overthrow the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee. According to the Hapdong News Agency, more than 300 elementary school students, led by teachers, surrounded several tanks, demanding "Don't point your guns at our parents!" Since the evening of the 25th, all the policemen in the police outposts have run away in fear.

According to reports, the brave Seoul demonstration army, waving flags, did not take the tanks and armed soldiers seriously. The young students in the demonstration army took control of almost every car they saw on the street. When the tanks of the Rhee puppet military police rushed towards the demonstrators, hundreds and thousands of demonstrators rushed to the front of the tanks and stood still. They shouted: "Run us over! Dare you?!" After a struggle, the demonstration army successively captured six tanks. Old ladies, children, and students all climbed onto the tanks. An old lady stood on top of a tank and shouted: "Go to Gyeongmudae (Syngman Rhee's residence)!" Subsequently, these tanks also demonstrated on the streets under the compulsion of the demonstrators. According to reports, the demonstrators also attacked the armory of the Syngman Rhee group's "Public Security Bureau," seized many weapons and fought with the puppet military police. The demonstrators also shouted slogans in front of the U.S. Embassy and the Seoul branch of the United Press International.

In Busan, the main southern port, another large-scale demonstration struggle of more than 60,000 people broke out today. According to World News Agency, at 10:30 this morning, the demonstrators rushed into the Gyeongsangnam-do Party Department of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party and the Busan office of Syngman Rhee's special agent organization, the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," and smashed the internal equipment of these places with stones. Inside the Liberal Party's city party headquarters, angry crowds tore up the portraits of Syngman Rhee on the walls and shouted, "Down with the enemy of the people!"

According to Donghwa News Agency, by 1:00 p.m., the Busan demonstrators had destroyed or burned the Gyeongsangnam-do "government," the Busan "government," and the "governments" of various districts, the West Busan "police station," and six "police substations" of the Rhee puppet regime. The residences of the Liberal Party's "National Assembly" members and the Rhee puppet "Governor" and "Mayor" were also destroyed or burned by the masses. The Busan "Mayor" has stepped down under the attack of the demonstrators.

In Daegu, a large-scale demonstration of more than 30,000 people also broke out today. At a little after 1:00 p.m., 50 professors from Kyungpook National University and 600 students from various universities first held a demonstration, and the number of participants in the demonstration rapidly increased. They rushed into the office building of the Rhee puppet Gyeongsangbuk-do "Provincial Government." The Rhee puppet Governor and the Daegu "Mayor" were forced to write "resignations" on the spot and step down. The demonstrators also grabbed their collars and took them on a "street parade." According to reports, on the 25th, students from Kyungpook National University in Daegu and students from Korea University in Seoul also held demonstrations.

In Incheon, Masan, the southern port of Yeosu, the southeastern city of Ulsan, the city of Miryang, and Uijeongbu near the truce line, anti-American and anti-Rhee demonstrations also broke out today.

In Jinju in the south, on the 25th, more than 500 demonstrators, ignoring the threat of police knives and guns, rushed into the puppet police station and demanded that the police "chief" step down. The puppet police chief, who once rode on the people's heads and acted like a tyrant, said dejectedly: The Liberal Party is about to collapse.

The demonstrators then rushed to the Rhee puppet Jinju City "government" and the Jinju City Party Department of the Syngman Rhee Liberal Party, and dragged out the puppet mayor and the head of the city party committee of the Liberal Party, demanding that they step down; they had to bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt, and promised to step down.

In the face of the huge momentum of the people's demonstration, today the United States intensified its interference in the struggle of the South Korean people, and continued to use its combination of soft and hard tactics in an attempt to maintain its colonial rule over South Korea. The U.S. Embassy in South Korea issued its third statement, on the one hand expressing "full support" for the Syngman Rhee group's bloody suppression, and on the other hand talking a lot about "satisfying legitimate grievances." At the same time, U.S. "Ambassador" McConaughy and General Magruder, commander of the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea, held secret talks with Syngman Rhee. Shortly thereafter, Syngman Rhee issued a statement saying that he was "willing to resign as president if the people wished it," and that he had told his confidant, Lee Ki-bung, who was elected "vice president" in the recent fake election, "to resign from all his current public positions." He also promised to "hold new elections" and "agree to amend the constitution to implement representative government."

According to reports, in the rapidly changing situation, Syngman Rhee has fallen into extreme isolation. The "National Assembly," mainly composed of members of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, passed a resolution today demanding that Syngman Rhee immediately resign from his "presidential" position. At the same time, according to the Associated Press, the Liberal Party has begun to split, and more than half of the party's 152 members are planning to withdraw from the party and form a new party.

    夺取坦克车  袭击武器库  赶走伪警察
    汉城人民倾城大示威反法西斯统治
    李承晚处境极端孤立被迫表示“愿意”辞职美国加紧施展两面手法企图维持殖民统治
    据新华社平壤26日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民斗志昂扬，愈战愈强，继连续示威半个多月后，汉城人民今天又掀起了气势磅礴的倾城大示威，再接再厉地猛烈冲击摇摇欲坠的美国刺刀支持下的李承晚傀儡政权。
    据路透社报道，汉城今天共有五十万人参加反对美李集团法西斯统治的示威。他们高呼“李承晚滚下台来”、“李起鹏该死”、“偿还学生们的血债”和“不自由毋宁死”等口号。他们包围了李承晚的住宅，把拆除下来的李承晚铜像在街上拖着走，向它吐唾沫和扔石头。汉城市内所有街道上都有愤怒的人群，而且还有无数的人从郊区永登浦等地纷纷坐车或步行进入汉城。李承晚派出大批军队和坦克，向示威群众开枪和放射催泪弹。但是，在示威人群包围之下，李承晚集团派去镇压的坦克完全不能动弹。每辆坦克上都有几十人在高呼推翻李承晚反动统治的口号。据合同通讯社报道，有三百多名小学生在教师率领下包围着几辆坦克，要求“不要把炮口对着我们的父母！”从25日晚上起，所有的警察岗亭的警察都吓跑了。
    据报道，勇敢的汉城示威大军，摇着旗子，全不把坦克和武装士兵放在眼里。示威大军中的青年学生掌握了在市街上看到的几乎每一辆车子。当李伪军警的坦克向示威人民冲来时，成百上千的示威者赶到坦克前面去，站着不动。他们喊道：“轧死我们吧！你敢吗？！”经过一场斗争，示威大军先后缴获了六辆坦克。老太太、儿童和学生都爬上坦克。一个老太太站在坦克顶上高呼：“到景武台（李承晚住所）去！”随后，这些坦克在示威人民的强迫下也在大街上示威。据报道，示威群众还袭击了李承晚集团的“治安局”的武器库，夺取了许多武器同伪军警战斗。示威人民还在美国大使馆门前和美国合众国际社驻汉城分社的门前高呼口号。
    在南部主要港口釜山，今天又爆发了六万多人的大规模的示威斗争。据世界通讯社报道，今天上午十时三十分，示威人民冲进李承晚的自由党的庆尚南道的党部和李承晚特务组织——“反共青年团”在釜山的办公处，用石头捣毁了这些地方的内部设备。在自由党市党部内，愤怒的群众撕毁了墙上的李承晚的像片，并且高呼“打倒人民的敌人！”
    据同和通讯社报道，到下午一时，釜山示威人民已经捣毁或焚烧了李伪政权的庆尚南道“政府”、釜山市“政府”和各区的“政府”、西釜山“警察署”和六个“派出所”。李承晚的自由党的“国会”议员和李伪“道知事”、“市长”的住宅也被群众捣毁或焚烧了。釜山市“市长”在示威群众的打击下已经下台。
    在大丘，今天也爆发了三万多人的大规模示威。下午一时多，庆北大学的五十名教授和六百多名各大学学生首先举行示威，参加示威的人迅速增加。他们冲进李伪庆尚北道“道政府”办公厅。李伪道“知事”和大丘“市长”被迫当场写“辞呈”下台。示威群众又抓住他们的衣领，带着他们“游街”。据报道，25日，大丘市的庆北大学学生和从汉城来的高丽大学学生也曾经举行了示威游行。
    在仁川、马山、南部丽水港、东南部的蔚山市、密阳市和靠近停战线的议政府今天也爆发了反美反李的示威斗争。
    在南部晋州，25日有五百多名示威学生，不顾警察的刀枪威胁冲进了伪警察署，要警察“署长”下台。这个曾经骑在人民头上作威作福的伪警察署长颓丧地说：自由党就要完蛋了。
    示威群众接着又冲向李伪晋州市“政府”和李承晚自由党晋州市党部，揪出了伪市长和自由党的市党委员会的头子，叫他们下台；他们不得不向人民低头认罪，并且答应下台。
    在巨大声势的人民示威面前，今天美国加紧干涉南朝鲜人民的斗争，继续施展其软硬兼施的伎俩，以图维持它对南朝鲜的殖民统治。美国驻南朝鲜“大使馆”第三次发表声明，一面表示“充分支持”李承晚集团的血腥镇压，一面也大谈“满足正当的不满”。同时，美国“大使”麦克瑙吉和统率美国驻南朝鲜占领军的总司令马格鲁德同李承晚举行了密谈。随后不久，李承晚发表声明，表示愿意辞去总统职务，如果人民希望这样的话”，并且说他已经告诉他的亲信、在最近伪选中当选“副总统”的李起鹏“要他辞去他现在的一切公职”。他还答应要“举行新的选举”，“同意修改宪法，以实行代议制”。
    据报道，在急转直下的形势下，李承晚已经陷于极端孤立。主要由李承晚的自由党的议员组成的“国会”今天通过决议，要求李承晚立即辞去“总统”的职务。同时，据美联社报道，自由党开始分裂，这个党一百五十二名议员中，已有半数以上正在计划退党另组新党。（附图片）
