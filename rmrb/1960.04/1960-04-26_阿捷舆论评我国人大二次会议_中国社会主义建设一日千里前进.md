Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Newspapers and radio stations in Albania and other countries have recently published articles and commentaries on the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China.

    The Albanian "Youth Daily" published an article on the 16th, pointing out that the National Economic Plan of the People's Republic of China for 1960 and the State Budget for 1960 clearly demonstrate that the great People's China is advancing by leaps and bounds along the road of building socialism. The article emphasized that in the past two years, under the leadership of the wise and far-sighted Marxist-Leninist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan. Based on this fact, it is entirely certain that 1960 will be a year of continued great leaps forward for the Chinese people, and the task of catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products will not be completed in the initially estimated fifteen years, but in less than ten years. The Albanian people and the people of all fraternal socialist countries are delighted with this great victory. This victory deals a fatal blow to the imperialist groups and their lackeys, the Yugoslav revisionists, who are slandering the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China.

    The article said that due to these achievements and the peaceful foreign policy pursued by China, the great People's China enjoys indisputable prestige and reputation in Asia and the world.

    Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the international situation and foreign relations at the meeting, the article said that this once again convincingly shows that the People's China has made tremendous contributions to easing international tensions, and China has become an important factor for peace and security in Asia and the world. The article said that Premier Zhou Enlai's ongoing visits to Burma, India, and Nepal will help consolidate the good-neighborly relations advocated by China.

    The Albanian Ministry of National Defense's newspaper "Warrior Daily" published a commentary on the 17th entitled "Huge Strides," stating that the recent session of the Chinese National People's Congress in Beijing clearly proved that the great Chinese people are advancing with great vigor.

    The commentary pointed out that the working people of China, due to their enthusiasm and courage in responding to the Party's call for a "Great Leap Forward," completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years. In this situation, the Chinese people, with revolutionary vigor, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have created all the conditions for a continued Great Leap Forward in 1960, striving to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years.

    The commentary said that the Chinese National People's Congress formulated the tasks for 1960, and the Chinese people will complete them as excellently as in the past. Due to close cooperation with the people of other countries in the socialist family and due to the great assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people will complete these tasks.

    The commentary also said that the peace-loving policy of the Party and government of the People's Republic of China is a strong guarantee for the peaceful labor of the Chinese people. Today, the People's Republic of China enjoys great prestige in Asia and the world, and it has become an indestructible fortress for peace and security in the Far East and against the conspiracies of American imperialism.

    The commentary concluded by saying that the Albanian people and the People's Army are heartily pleased with the great achievements of the Chinese people, and they congratulate the Chinese people on ending 1960 with even more brilliant achievements, and they congratulate socialist China on its further prosperity.

    Czechoslovak Radio commented on the Second Session of the National People's Congress of China, saying that China is continuing to maintain the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and China knows how to utilize the enthusiasm of the masses and how to implement the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods in production. The article said that the in-depth and extensive discussions at this conference showed that the political awareness of the broad masses of Chinese workers has greatly improved since the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

    Czechoslovakia's "Slovak Truth Daily" published a commentary on the 19th, saying that the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China, which was recently held in Beijing, was a meeting of particular importance.

    The commentary emphasized that the meeting showed that China's "Great Leap Forward" in economic development over the past two years has not only not stopped this year, but will continue.

    The commentary emphasized that China is creating real miracles in steel production when it comes to the large increase in the production of China's major industrial sectors.

    The commentary pointed out that China's practice in the past two years has provided rich experience, proving that under the socialist system, the national economy can make great leaps forward. At the same time, China has also paid attention to making backward sectors catch up with advanced sectors, so as to achieve a comprehensive great leap forward in all sectors of the national economy.

    The commentary said that the achievements made by China in the past two years are "unique in the history of modern industrial countries."
