    A Thousand Li Journey to Deliver Tools
    I often think about what the Party told us old workers: we must play a backbone and leading role, and there should be no exceptions even after retirement. When the neighborhood committee set up a cafeteria, I helped build the houses and construct the stoves. At the end of the year before last, Guangdong and Guizhou entrusted our factory to train workers, and I and several other workers took on this task. Now they can do the work of a general fitter. Recently, the factory has been carrying out a technical revolution, and I have been helping the cafeteria with vegetable cutting machines, washing machines, radish shredding machines, and fish scaling machines.
    This time, I also have a share in supporting the construction of Ningxia. The comrades from the trade union said to me: "If you are not used to the life or your health is not good, you can come back early." I said, "How can that be? Since I'm going, I have to make a name for myself and truly make a contribution to the construction of Ningxia. To show a little bit of our Shanghai workers' heart, we picked some commonly used tools to give to the workers in Ningxia before we left."

    千里送工具
    我常常想着党告诉我们老工人的话：要发挥骨干带头作用，就是退休了也不能例外。里弄办食堂时，我帮助搭房子、砌炉灶。前年年底，广东、贵州委托我们厂里培训工人，我和另外几个工人就把这个任务担下来了。现在一般的钳工的活他们都能做了。最近，厂里大闹技术革命，我又帮食堂搞切菜机、洗菜机、切萝卜丝机、削鱼鳞机等。
    这回支援宁夏建设也有我的份。工会的同志对我说：“你如果生活不习惯，身体不好，可以早回来。”我说：“那怎么行呢，既然去了就要搞出个名堂来，真正给宁夏的建设作出点贡献才行。为了表示我们上海工人的一点心意，临走我们挑了一些常用的工具送给宁夏的工人。
