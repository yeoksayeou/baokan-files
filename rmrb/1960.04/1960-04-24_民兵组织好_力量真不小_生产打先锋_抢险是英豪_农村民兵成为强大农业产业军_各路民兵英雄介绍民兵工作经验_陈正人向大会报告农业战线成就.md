	Good Militia Organization, Great Strength, Pioneers in Production, Heroes in Disaster Relief
	Rural Militia Become a Powerful Agricultural Industrial Army
	Militia Heroes from All Quarters Introduce Militia Work Experience; Chen Zhengren Reports to the Congress on Achievements on the Agricultural Front
	According to Xinhua News Agency, the National Militia Representatives Conference continued its group meetings on the afternoon of the 21st, and held medium-sized meetings in different zones on the 22nd. Militia heroes from all quarters widely introduced and exchanged their brilliant achievements and rich experience in developing militia divisions on a large scale. Representatives of rural people's commune militia divisions and regiments, in their speeches, used a large number of vivid facts to illustrate that the vast militia of rural people's communes have become a powerful socialist agricultural industrial army.
	Many representatives' speeches enthusiastically praised the great significance of developing militia divisions on a large scale for the people's communes to better implement military organization, combat action, collective life, and democratic management. The representative from Shandong Province introduced the contributions of their eight million militiamen, organized into 1,600 water conservancy construction regiments, to agricultural production. The representative said that they fought hard throughout the winter and spring, completing and basically completing 44 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, over 12,000 small reservoirs, and over 240,000 ponds, dams, water storage pools, diversion rivers, and interception of subsurface flow projects, expanding the irrigated area by 20 million mu. More than 157,000 militia specialized teams and shock brigades throughout the province have become vanguards on all fronts of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in various communes. Xie Zhijie, the representative of the Lie Mian District Militia Division in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, said in his speech that their hometown suffered a severe drought last year, the worst in decades. The district committee temporarily changed the militia division into an "Anti-Drought Combat Division," and the party secretary personally led the militia to fight the drought demon for more than 60 days, setting up a large water dragon formation and drawing water from the Jialing River up the mountain at a height of 50 zhang, saving the seedlings and winning a bumper harvest. Many representatives also introduced moving stories of militia organizations in crash planting and harvesting, and in overcoming wind and hail disasters. They said that a good militia organization has great strength, is a pioneer in production, and a hero in disaster relief!
	Many representatives also pointed out in their speeches that the militia in various places are also heroic fighters in eliminating beasts and protecting agricultural production. Zhang Yangyou, the captain of the Dao Xia Hunting Team of the Xia Dao People's Commune in Fujian Province, said that their hunting team had traveled through more than 3,600 mountain villages in Minhou, Jinjiang, and other places. In ten years, they eliminated 107,891 harmful beasts of all kinds, such as tigers, leopards, jackals, wolves, and wild boars, in the deep mountains and dense forests. At the same time, they have also trained more than 2,500 hunters. The representatives introduced many heroic examples of eliminating beasts and pests, fully illustrating the noble character of the militia's loyalty to the people and to the cause of socialist construction.
	On the front lines of agricultural technical innovation and technical revolution, the vast militia showed a heroic pioneering style. He Sibin, deputy political commissar of the Zhanggang People's Commune Militia Division in Hubei Province, and Xu Baoxiang, representative of the Jiuxi People's Commune Militia Company in Yunnan Province, introduced the deeds of the militia's large-scale experimental high-yield fields, leaving a deep impression on the representatives. The 32,000 mu of high-yield cotton experimental fields planted by the Zhanggang People's Commune militia achieved a bumper harvest of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu under extremely severe natural disasters. They successfully trial-produced four kinds of indigenous pesticides, which played a great role in eliminating cotton aphids and saved the commune 270,000 yuan in pesticide costs. Zhang Youdao, head of the Suxian County Water Conservancy Construction Corps Militia Regiment in Anhui Province, and "local expert" militia Gong Peizhi, etc., after experiencing more than 300 failures, finally successfully produced trailer-type power trolleys, winnowing basket-type power trolleys, cross-ridge power trolleys, and trackless power trolleys, basically realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of water conservancy construction, with an average daily work efficiency of more than 70 cubic meters per person, and a maximum of 102 cubic meters. Recently, they have also preliminarily trial-produced a water management tool that turns the four processes of digging, loading, transporting, and unloading into one, with a daily work efficiency of more than 160 cubic meters. They are determined to realize full mechanization and automation of water management tools in the shortest possible time.
	Many representatives pledged to the Party in their speeches that they would certainly hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule. Shan Shoude, instructor of the Dafangshen Red Flag Militia Battalion in Faku County, Liaoning Province, said that they planted 7,500 mu of high-yield Red Flag fields last year, and are determined to double that this year and realize water conservancy on these lands. Many representatives exchanged their experiences and drawings of inventions and creations in the discussion, and some even sent the experiences and drawings back to their communes overnight to promote the rapid mechanization of agriculture.
	Representatives who spoke at group meetings and medium-sized meetings also enthusiastically praised the great role of large-scale militia divisions in promoting the comprehensive and continuous leap forward of industry, finance and trade, postal and telecommunications, culture, education, and health, and school work.
	On the morning of the 21st, the conference held a plenary meeting. Chen Zhengren, Minister of Agricultural Machinery, made a report on agricultural issues at the meeting, introducing the great achievements on the agricultural front in our country since the Great Leap Forward, and talked about future tasks. He hoped that the vast militia and the people of the whole country would resolutely realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule, and strive for a continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

    各路民兵英雄介绍民兵工作经验　陈正人向大会报告农业战线成就
    据新华社讯　全国民兵代表会议，21日下午继续开小组会，22日分区举行中型会议，各路民兵英雄在会上广泛地介绍和交流大办民兵师的辉煌成就和丰富经验。农村人民公社民兵师团的代表们，在发言中以大量的生动事实说明，农村人民公社广大民兵已成为一支强大的社会主义的农业产业军。
    许多代表的发言都热烈颂扬大办民兵师对人民公社更好地实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化的重大意义。山东省代表介绍了他们八百万民兵组成的一千六百个水利建设团对农业生产的贡献。代表说，他们大战一冬春，完成和基本完成大、中型水利工程四十四项，小型水库一万二千多座，塘坝、蓄水池、引河、截潜流工程二十四万多处，扩大灌溉面积二千万亩。全省十五万七千多个民兵专业队和突击队，成了各个公社农、林、牧、副、渔各条战线上的尖兵。四川省武胜县烈面区民兵师代表谢志杰在发言中说，去年他们家乡遭受了几十年未有过的特大旱灾。区委将民兵师临时改为“抗旱战斗师”，党委书记亲自出马率领民兵，与旱魔搏斗六十余天，大摆水龙阵，在五十丈高的陡崖上由嘉陵江引水上山，抢救了禾苗，夺得丰收。许多代表还在发言中介绍了民兵组织在抢种抢收、战胜风雹灾害等方面的动人事迹。他们说，民兵组织好，力量真不小，生产打先锋，抢险是英豪！
    许多代表发言中还指出，各地民兵还是灭兽除害、保卫农业生产的英勇战士。福建省夏道人民公社刀霞打猎队队长章仰猷说，他们的打猎队踏遍了闽侯、晋江等三千六百多个山村，十年中，在深山密林中消灭虎、豹、豺、狼、野猪等各种害兽十万七千八百九十一只。同时，还培养了二千五百多名猎手。代表们介绍了许多英勇的灭兽除害事例，充分说明民兵忠于人民、忠于社会主义建设事业的高贵品德。
    在农业技术革新和技术革命战线上，广大民兵表现了豪迈的闯将风格。湖北省张港人民公社民兵师副政委何泗斌和云南省九溪人民公社民兵连代表徐宝祥介绍民兵大搞丰产试验田的事迹，给代表们留下了深刻的印象。张港人民公社民兵种的三万二千多亩棉花丰产试验田，在特大自然灾害的条件下，获得了亩产皮棉一百多斤的大丰收。他们试制成功四种土农药，对于消灭棉蚜虫起了极大作用，并为公社节省了二十七万元农药费。安徽省宿县水利基建团民兵团长张友道和“土专家”民兵龚培芝等，经历了三百多次失败，终于制作成功拖斗式动力滑车、簸箕式动力滑车、越岭式动力滑车和无轨式动力滑车，基本上实现了水利建设施工半机械化和机械化，日工效每人平均七十多立方米，最高达到一百零二立方米。最近，他们又初步试制成功使挖、装、运、卸四道工序变为一道工序的治水工具，日工效达到一百六十多立方米。他们决心在最短期间内实现治水工具全盘机械化、自动化。
    许多代表在发言中向党保证，一定高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要。辽宁省法库县大房申红旗民兵营教导员单守德说，他们在去年种高产红旗田七千五百亩，今年决心再扩大一倍，并使这些土地实现水利化。许多代表在讨论中相互交换了发明创造的经验和图样，有的人还连夜把经验、图样寄回公社，促进农业尽快地实现机械化。
    在小组会和中型会议上发言的代表，还热情地颂扬了大办民兵师对促进工业、财贸、邮电通讯、文教卫生和学校工作等全面持续跃进的巨大作用。
    21日上午，大会举行全体会议。农业机械部部长陈正人在会上作了关于农业问题的报告，介绍了大跃进以来我国农业战线上的伟大成就，并谈到了今后的任务。他希望广大民兵和全国人民一道，坚决提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要，争取农业生产持续跃进。
