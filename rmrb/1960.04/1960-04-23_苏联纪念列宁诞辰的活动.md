    Soviet Activities Commemorating Lenin's Birthday
    Moscow Hosts "Lenin Lectures"
    To commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth, Moscow hosted special "Lenin Lectures." The lectures began in January this year and ended in April.
    Many veteran party members who worked with Lenin, prominent scientists, social activists, and heads of some government departments used these lectures to introduce the foundations of Leninism to the masses from various perspectives, as well as Lenin's role in leading the Communist Party and creating the Soviet state.
    "Lenin" Symphony Revived
    The symphony "Lenin," composed by Soviet composer Shebalin, was re-performed in Moscow on April 15. This symphony, including solo vocals, recitations, mixed choir, and a large orchestra, was originally completed in 1931 and performed in Moscow and Leningrad in 1933, receiving enthusiastic acclaim from the audience. However, its score was later destroyed in a fire at the library of the Bolshoi Theatre, interrupting its performance. It was not until last year that a fragment of the musical score manuscript was accidentally discovered in a Moscow library. Thus, based on these fragments and some original manuscripts collected by Shebalin, the full score of the symphony was restored.
    When the score of this dramatic musical piece was restored, the musicians, with great excitement, rehearsed it in a very short time and successfully presented it to the audience again on the eve of the commemoration of Lenin's birthday.
    Exhibition of Lenin Memorabilia
    An exhibition of Lenin memorabilia, including stamps, art postcards, badges, commemorative medals, credit notes, and matchbox labels, was recently held at the Cultural Palace of the Moscow Underground Railway Construction Bureau.
    The exhibits include stamps commemorating Lenin collected by Dr. Zbarsky, which have won many awards. There are also stamps with the autographs of Mao Zedong, Novotny, Kadar, and Hoxha collected by engineer Rybalchenko.
    Establishment of Lenin Scholarships
    The Soviet Council of Ministers has established Lenin Scholarships for university students and graduate students in commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    According to regulations, there are 2,200 scholarships for undergraduates, each worth 800 rubles per month; and 100 scholarships for graduate students, each worth 1,100 rubles per month.

    苏联纪念列宁诞辰的活动
    莫斯科举办“列宁讲座”
    为纪念列宁诞生九十周年，莫斯科举办了专门的“列宁讲座”。讲座从今年1月开始直到4月结束。
    很多曾和列宁一起工作过的老党员、著名的科学家、社会活动家和一些政府部门的负责人，通过这个讲座从各方面向群众介绍列宁主义的基础和列宁在领导共产党和创建苏维埃国家过程中的作用。
    “列宁”交响曲重新上演
    苏联作曲家谢巴林创作的交响曲“列宁”于4月15日重新在莫斯科演出。这部包括各声部的独唱、朗诵、混声合唱和大型乐队的交响曲原在1931年就已创作完成，而且1933年在莫斯科和列宁格勒演奏过，受到听众的热烈欢迎。但后来，它的总谱在苏联大剧院图书馆一次火灾中烧毁，因而中断了演出，直到去年才在莫斯科的一个书库中偶然发现了乐谱手稿的残本。于是，根据这些片断的手稿和谢巴林收藏的部分原稿重新恢复了这首交响曲的总谱。
    当这首富有戏剧性的乐曲的总谱恢复后，音乐家们以极兴奋的心情，在很短的时间内排练出来，成功地使它在纪念列宁诞辰的前夕重新和听众见面了。
    纪念列宁的搜集品展览会
    纪念列宁的邮票、艺术明信片、徽章、纪念章、信用券和火柴盒面画搜集展览会最近在莫斯科地下电车道建设工程局文化宫举行。
    展品包括曾多次获奖的兹巴尔斯基医师搜集的纪念列宁的邮票。还有雷巴尔钦科工程师收集的带有毛泽东、诺沃提尼、卡达尔和霍查亲笔签名的邮票。
    制定列宁奖学金
    苏联部长会议为纪念列宁诞生九十周年给高等学校的学生和研究生制定了列宁奖学金。
    根据规定，大学生奖学金名额为二千二百个，每个名额每月为八百卢布；研究生奖学金名额为一百个，每个名额每月为一千一百卢布。
