　　(Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai suburban rural public canteens, based on the principle of "actively running them well, voluntary participation," have been continuously consolidated and are getting better and better through continuous rectification.

　　Rural public canteens were a product of the Great Leap Forward. Between the spring and summer of 1958, many seasonal canteens were established in the suburban counties. After communization, these seasonal canteens gradually developed into year-round canteens. After several rectifications, the management level of the year-round canteens has continuously improved, and more and more members are participating in the canteens. Currently, there are 24,328 public canteens in the suburbs, with 96% of farm households participating; those who have not yet participated are mainly farm households in isolated villages far from the canteen and a small number of members in the semi-worker-peasant households in the near suburbs.

　　According to the different economic conditions and income levels of each production team, the public canteens have adopted three different supply methods: food supply system, grain supply system, and partial grain supply system. In canteens implementing the partial grain supply system, the members' own ration grain and vegetable money are supplied by the canteen according to fixed quantities, and the expenses are deducted during the year-end distribution. Needy households with few laborers and many family members are appropriately subsidized by the production team from the public welfare fund to cover the basic rations for the elderly and children. This ensures that the lives of the vast majority of members are reasonably arranged, and the widowed, orphaned, and needy households in rural areas enjoy the greatest social security. The public canteen has become the "chief steward" for arranging the economic lives of the members.

　　In order to actively run the canteens well, all localities generally conscientiously implement the mass line and practice democratic management. Most canteens have established canteen management committees through democratic elections. The majority of the members of the management committee are poor and lower-middle peasants. They firmly support the canteen and are the solid backbone of the canteen. The canteen management committee regularly listens to the opinions of the members, periodically discusses the work of the canteen, studies improvement methods, and helps the canteen staff to run the canteen diligently and frugally. The canteen accounts are audited regularly, settled daily and cleared monthly, and published monthly for members to review and accept everyone's supervision. In addition to establishing a canteen management committee, the Lianong No. 6 Small Team Canteen in Maqiao Commune, Shanghai County, also selected two supervisors. The canteen management committee holds a meeting every half month to study the work of the canteen. The members often participate in labor with the members to absorb everyone's opinions and sometimes hold enlarged meetings with the participation of production team leaders and activists to discuss the work of the canteen. The canteen's assets, income, and expenditure are promptly posted and also reported orally to the members' meeting every month, so that the members can regularly understand the canteen's work and participate in the management of the canteen.

　　In order to actively improve the lives of the members and enable everyone to eat well and have enough to eat, in addition to universally implementing the policy of "fixing quantities according to the number of people, assigning targets to households, distributing food to the canteen, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself," the canteens also actively develop "small household businesses": planting vegetables, raising pigs, raising poultry, and raising fish. Many canteens not only provide vegetables for every meal but also provide both vegetables and soup and eat meat several times a month. Currently, the canteens raise more than 90,000 pigs and cultivate more than 90,000 mu of vegetable plots. The Zhuxiangjing Canteen of Chengxiang Commune in Qingpu County, thanks to the establishment of a non-staple food supply base and the active planting of vegetables, raising of pigs, raising of fish, and raising of poultry, members can eat fresh vegetables every meal. In addition to supplying the city, it also pickles and stores more than 1,000 jin of pickled vegetables and mustard tubers. The canteen eats meat three times a month, serves large portions of meat during festivals, and the members are very satisfied.

　　With the development of the rural tool reform movement, public canteens have also made great efforts to reform cooking utensils. Many canteens in Chuansha, Shanghai, Qingpu, and other counties have mined natural gas and biogas for cooking and lighting, and for setting up bathhouses. Two hundred and eight public canteens in Chuansha County use natural gas for cooking, and some canteens have realized automatic water supply, semi-mechanized vegetable cutting, rice washing, and vegetable washing, and mechanized transportation by vehicles and ships. After the reform of cooking utensils in the Qingchun Canteen of Heqing Commune in this county, each cook is now responsible for serving 102 people, an increase from the original 60 people. The labor intensity of the cooks has been greatly reduced, and they can have more energy and time to improve and enhance their cooking skills, and the members are more satisfied with their meals.

　　With the widespread establishment of public canteens, the collective welfare undertakings of the members have also gradually developed with the canteen as the center. Nurseries, small shops, and bathhouses have been established successively. Some canteens also have book boxes and recreational supplies. Members like to gather in the canteen to learn culture, read books, and carry out recreational activities during their breaks. Production teams also discuss production, arrange tasks, and hold meetings in the canteen. Therefore, the public canteen has not only become a place for members to eat but has also naturally formed a center for political, economic, and cultural activities. Every evening, men, women, and children gather in the No. 1 Small Team Canteen of the Sitang Production Team in Yangxing Commune, Baoshan County. The canteen has natural gas lights and provides hot water and books. Young people read newspapers and participate in literacy classes, adults discuss production, and women do needlework. The canteen's small shop has a variety of daily necessities for everyone to choose from. Therefore, the members regard the canteen as a warm family, and everyone is wholeheartedly devoted to the canteen.

### 养猪种菜建立家底，收支账目按月公布，克勤克俭人人满意  上海农村食堂管理水平不断提高

    养猪种菜建立家底，收支账目按月公布，克勤克俭人人满意
    上海农村食堂管理水平不断提高
    本报讯　上海郊区农村公共食堂根据“积极办好，自愿参加”的原则，经过不断整顿，越办越好，越办越巩固。
    农村公共食堂是大跃进的产物。1958年春夏之间，郊区各县都举办了许多农忙食堂，公社化以后，农忙食堂又逐步发展为常年食堂。常年食堂又经过多次整顿，经营管理水平不断提高，参加食堂的社员也越来越多。现在全郊区共有公共食堂二万四千三百二十八个，参加食堂的农户占总农户96％；还没有参加食堂的主要是一些离开食堂较远的独家村农户和近郊半工半农户中的少数社员。
    根据各生产队不同的经济条件和收入水平，各公共食堂分别采取了三种不同的供给办法：一种是伙食供给制；一种是粮食供给制；另一种是部分粮食供给制。实行部分粮食供给制的食堂，社员自己负担的口粮和菜金，均由食堂按照定量供应，费用在年终分配时扣除。劳力少人口多的困难户由生产队从公益金中适当补助，把老人和小孩的基本口粮包下来。这样就使得广大社员的生活得到合理的安排，农村中鳏寡孤独以及困难户，享受到最大的社会保险，公共食堂已成为安排社员经济生活的“总管家”。
    各地为了积极办好食堂，一般都认真地贯彻群众路线，实行民主管理。大部分食堂都经过民主选举，建立了食堂管理委员会。管理委员会成员以贫农下中农居大多数。他们坚决拥护食堂，是食堂的坚实支柱。食堂管理委员会经常听取社员意见，定期讨论食堂工作，研究改进办法，帮助食堂工作人员克勤克俭办好食堂。食堂账目定期审核，日结月清，按月公布，及时提交社员审查，接受大家监督。上海县马桥公社联农六小队食堂除了建立食堂管理委员会外，还选派了两个监督员，食堂管理委员会每半月开一次会研究食堂工作，各委员经常通过和社员一起劳动，吸取大家意见，有时还召开有生产小组长和积极分子参加的扩大会议讨论食堂工作。食堂的家底、收支等及时张榜公布，还逐月向社员大会作口头报告，使社员经常了解食堂工作情况，参与食堂的管理。
    为了积极改善社员生活，使大家吃得饱、吃得好，各食堂除了普遍实行“以人定量，指标到户，实物到堂，凭票吃饭，节约归己”的政策外，还积极发展“小家务”：种植蔬菜，养猪，养家禽，养鱼。许多食堂不仅顿顿有菜供应，还做到有菜有汤，一月吃几次荤。目前食堂养猪九万余头；种菜面积达九万余亩。青浦县城厢公社珠厢泾食堂，由于建立了副食品供应基地，积极种菜、养猪、养鱼、养家禽，社员顿顿能吃到新鲜的蔬菜，除供应城市外，还腌制贮藏了一千多斤咸菜、大头菜。食堂一月吃三次小荤，逢时过节开大荤，社员吃得都很满意。
    随着农村工具改革运动的开展，公共食堂也大闹炊具改革。川沙、上海、青浦等县有不少食堂开采了天然气、沼气，用来烧饭照明，举办浴室。川沙县有二百零八个公共食堂都用天然气烧饭作菜，有些食堂并已实现了吃水自流化，切菜淘米洗菜半机械化，运输车船化。这个县的合庆公社青春食堂在炊具革新后，每个炊事员负担用膳人数即由原来六十人增加到一百零二人，炊事员的劳动强度大大减轻，能有更多的精力和时间去改进和提高烹调技术，社员吃得更加满意。
    公共食堂普遍设立，社员集体生活福利事业也以食堂为中心逐渐发展起来，托儿所、小卖部、浴室等相继成立，有些食堂还设有图书箱、文娱用品，社员们休息时都喜欢聚集到食堂学文化，阅览书籍，开展文娱活动。生产队讨论生产，布置任务，开会鸣放等等也大都在食堂进行。因此，公共食堂就不仅成为社员吃饭的场所，而且又自然地形成了政治、经济、文化活动的中心。宝山县杨行公社泗塘生产队一小队食堂每天晚间，男女老少便聚集食堂。食堂里有天然气灯，备有开水、图书。青年人阅读书报，参加扫盲学习，成年人议论生产，妇女做针线活。食堂里的小卖部备有各种日用品，让大家选购。所以社员们把食堂看成是温暖的大家庭，大家一心向着食堂。
