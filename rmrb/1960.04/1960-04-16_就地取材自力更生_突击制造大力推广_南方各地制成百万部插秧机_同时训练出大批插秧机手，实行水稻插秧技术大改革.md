Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch. The rice-producing areas of our country, especially in the South, have launched a vigorous upsurge in manufacturing, promoting, and using rice transplanters.

Large numbers of rice transplanters have been rushed into production in various locations, and some have already been used in early rice transplanting. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, by the end of March, fourteen provinces and regions, including Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hubei, had produced over one million rice transplanters of various models, including the Hunan Liling No. 2, Jiangxi 59 type, and Nanjing 105B, combining indigenous, foreign, and semi-indigenous/semi-foreign designs. Hunan Province produced the most, exceeding the province's original manufacturing plan. Guizhou Province has manufactured over 90% of its planned transplanters. In Tongren County, the vast majority of rice to be planted this year will be done using transplanters. In Guangxi's Guanyang County, the planned area for early rice has expanded elevenfold compared to last year, averaging one transplanter for every sixteen mu of land. Currently, some transplanters in Guangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces are already in the fields, becoming effective tools for early rice transplanting. In Guangxi's Yulin County, the Xiaopingshan Commune used transplanters to plant early rice, with an average transplanter planting more than five mu per day, increasing work efficiency several times compared to manual transplanting. Li Jingqun, a member of the Xindi Commune in Cangwu County, also created a high record of 21.75 mu per day using the Guangxi 59-3 type transplanter. In the month since the National On-Site Evaluation Conference for Rice Transplanters and Semi-Mechanized Paddy Field Farming Tools was held in February, various regions have successively held on-site meetings, skill contests, debates, telephone conferences, and radio broadcasts on transplanters. They have also carried out crash training of manufacturing technicians and operators, strengthening specific leadership over the work. Hunan and other regions have established transplanter command structures. Leading cadres from many counties, communes, and factories in Jiangxi Province have gone deep into the front lines of production and manufacturing. Guizhou Province's special districts, counties, and communes have successively held over seventy on-site meetings on transplanters. The major reform of rice transplanting technology has been welcomed by millions of people in rice-producing areas, and a new trend of "every commune rushing to manufacture transplanters, everyone striving to become a transplanter operator" has emerged in many areas of the South. Currently, the upsurge in rushing to manufacture and promote transplanters is growing wave upon wave. Many factories are racing against time, determined to rush to manufacture another batch of transplanters before the early rice transplanting season. The Northeast rice-producing areas, where the season is later, are also actively preparing to manufacture and promote rice transplanters.

In the rush to manufacture transplanters, the vast numbers of workers and cadres in mechanical and agricultural implement factories in various regions are determined to fully support the continuous leap forward in agriculture, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, thereby accelerating production progress and improving labor productivity. Cadres, technicians, and workers at the Chetou Agricultural Machinery Factory of the Daoxian People's Commune in Hunan Province combined and helped each other, so that the entire process of manufacturing transplanters was modeled and standardized. Originally, it took five and a half workdays to produce one transplanter, now one worker can produce one. Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, changed ten accessories of the transplanter, such as the main shaft cam plate, from iron forging to sand casting, increasing work efficiency by two to ten times and also saving steel. According to the county's total task, a total of 3,000 kilograms of steel can be saved, and more than 5,000 workdays can be saved. Various regions also pay special attention to the quality of transplanters. Many factories in Hunan Province have formulated a four-level (group, workshop, factory director, county/commune) acceptance system, so that most of the transplanters manufactured meet quality requirements. Counties such as Hechi in Guangxi adopted a three-check factory exit method, that is, each transplanter must be checked by the manufacturer, the workshop, and technicians, and only those that pass are allowed to leave the factory. Agricultural implement factories at all levels in Guizhou Province have universally established a manufacturing responsibility system, and also established a technical research group to specifically study manufacturing technology, to ensure that the transplanters leaving the factory are "high quality in every batch, and usable in every unit." According to acceptance inspections, the transplanters in the province have basically reached quality standards.

The transplanters in various regions are all manufactured using self-reliance and utilizing local resources. In order not to ask the state for materials, Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, tried every possible means to research and develop the use of wooden chutes to replace iron parts and screw transmission belts, so that the main parts originally made of steel or white iron were made of wood, greatly saving steel and reducing costs.

While manufacturing transplanters in large quantities, various regions have also stepped up the opening of short-term training classes, training a large number of transplanter operators. By the end of March, the five provinces and regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Hunan had trained 800,000 to 900,000 transplanter operators. Seventy-one counties in Hunan Province held training classes, and the trained transplanter operators can ensure that there is an average of more than one operator for each existing transplanter. Guizhou Province trained more than 390,000 transplanter operators, most of whom are "able to use, able to repair, and able to explain" transplanter operators. The training classes in Hubei Province adopted a teaching method of learning and doing at the same time, combining theory with practice, so that the transplanter operators basically reached the level of three understandings (understanding the structural principles, understanding the performance characteristics, and understanding the adaptability) and five abilities (able to make, able to install, able to use, able to maintain, and able to teach).

    就地取材自力更生　突击制造大力推广
    南方各地制成百万部插秧机
    同时训练出大批插秧机手，实行水稻插秧技术大改革
    新华社15日讯　我国水稻产区，特别是南方各地掀起了轰轰烈烈的制造、推广、使用插秧机的高潮。
    各地已赶制出大批的插秧机，并有一部分在早稻插秧中使用。据农业部统计，到3月底，湖南、贵州、广西、湖北等十四个省区，已制成湖南醴陵二号、江西五九型、南京一O五B等各种型号的水稻插秧机，包括土的、洋的、半土半洋的共一百万部以上。湖南制成的最多，已超额完成了全省原订的制造计划。贵州省已制成的插秧机，相当于全省制造计划的90％以上。铜仁县今年要种植的水稻，绝大部分都可以用插秧机插秧。广西灌阳县今年早稻面积计划比去年扩大十一倍，平均每十六亩田将有一部插秧机。目前广西、贵州等省区有些插秧机已经下田，并成为当前早稻插秧的利器。广西玉林县小平山公社用插秧机插早稻，平均一部插秧机日插五亩多，工效比人插提高几倍。苍梧县新地公社社员李景群用广西五九—三型插秧机插秧还创造了日进度二十一·七五亩的高纪录。今年2月全国水稻插秧机和半机械化水田耕作农具现场评比会议举行后的一个多月以来，各地都相继召开了插秧机现场会、比武会、辩论会、电话会、广播会等和突击训练制造技术人员和操作人员，加强对工作的具体领导。湖南等地建立了插秧机指挥机构。江西省不少县、社和工厂的领导干部，深入生产制造第一线。贵州省的专区、县、公社先后召开插秧机现场会议七十多次。水稻插秧技术的大改革，受到了水稻产区千百万群众的欢迎，南方许多地区出现了“社社赶制插秧机，人人争当秧机手”的新风气。目前赶制、推广插秧机的高潮，正一浪高过一浪。许多工厂争分夺秒，要在早稻插秧前再突击制造出一批插秧机。季节较迟的东北水稻产区，也积极准备制造、推广水稻插秧机。
    在赶制插秧机中，各地机械厂、农具厂等的广大职工和干部决心全力支援农业连续跃进，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，从而加快了生产进度，提高劳动生产率。湖南道县人民公社车头农机厂干部、技术员、工人互相结合，互相帮助，使制造插秧机过程全部实现了模型化、样板化，原来五个半工生产一部插秧机，现在一个工可以生产一部。江西乐安县将插秧机的主轴凸板等十种配件，由铁打改为翻砂，提高工效二倍到十倍，还节约了钢材；按全县总任务计算，共可节约钢材三千公斤，节约工日五千多个。各地还特别注意插秧机的质量。湖南省的许多个工厂都制订了四级（小组、车间、厂长、县社）验收制度，使已制成的插秧机绝大部分合乎质量要求。广西河池等县采取了三查出厂的办法，即每部插秧机都要经过制造者检查、车间检查和技术人员检查，合格才让出厂。贵州省的各级农具厂普遍建立了制造责任制，还成立了技术研究小组，专门研究制造技术，以保证出厂的插秧机“批批高质、部部管用”。据验收，全省的插秧机基本上都达到了质量标准。
    各地的插秧机都是依靠自力更生就地取材的办法制成的。江西省永修县为了不向国家要材料，千方百计地研究出用木制的滑槽轴代替铁质零件、螺丝传动带等，使主要部分原用钢材或白铁做的都用木质的，大大节约了钢材，降低了成本。
    各地在大制插秧机的同时，又加紧开办短期训练班，训练了一大批插秧机手。广东、广西、浙江、贵州、湖南五省区，3月底已训练好插秧机手八、九十万人。湖南省有七十一个县举办了训练班，训练出来的插秧手可使现有的插秧机平均每部就有一个多人操作。贵州省训练插秧手三十九万多人，其中绝大部分都是“会使用、会修理、会讲解”的插秧机手。湖北省的训练班，采取边学、边做，理论联系实际的教学方法，使插秧机手都基本达到了三懂（懂结构原理、懂性能特点、懂适应性）五会（会做、会安装、会使用、会保养、会教学）的水平。
