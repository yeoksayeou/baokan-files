Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 national budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report "On Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule," I wholeheartedly support them. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC, and I am infinitely excited about our country's great continued leap forward.

Our country achieved world-shaking great achievements in national economic construction in 1959. The 1960 national economic plan envisions an even more comprehensive and continuing great leap forward. This marks the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of the Party's wise and correct leadership, and the great victory of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune – the three magic weapons that have deeply rooted themselves in the hearts of the people!

I firmly believe that the plan for the continued great leap forward in 1960 will definitely be realized! As Vice Premier Li pointed out, a nationwide upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has already formed. This is the most powerful guarantee to guide us from victory to victory.

Before this meeting, I had the honor of visiting China's Northeast industrial base. There, in every corner, just as Vice Premier Li said, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement is unfolding with the force of ten thousand horses galloping. I personally witnessed a new and fresh change in the face of Northeast industry. Much manual operation has been mostly mechanized and semi-mechanized, and mechanized operations have moved towards automation or semi-automation. In every industrial sector, heavy physical labor has been generally reduced or even eliminated. This has greatly increased the speed of production and construction, increased production many times over, doubled efficiency, or even increased it several times or dozens of times. Moreover, increased production without increasing manpower is a common phenomenon. A people's commune factory in Harbin, producing ethyl acetate, reformed its technology, increased its output by 640 times, and will continue to improve. Initially, I thought it would be easier to tap the potential of small factories, but even the largest and most modern factories, such as Changchun First Automobile Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel pipe plant, structural steel plant, etc., have also increased their output several times over, and are moving towards the grand goal of transforming one factory into four or five. The effect of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the Northeast is not only reflected in speed, but also in the improvement of technical level. When I saw the 10,000-ton giant ships being manufactured at Dalian Shipyard, I deeply felt that China's industrial level has entered the world's advanced ranks. High, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new technologies or products are now not a matter of learning and mastering, but have already entered a new stage of creative and independent development.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is like a myriad of colorful flowers, now blooming all over our vast land, and constantly bearing abundant fruits. It is not only the source of driving force for China's productivity, but also an excellent teaching material for socialist education. Below I will talk about the education and experience I personally gained from this visit:

First, the Communist Party of China is a great, correct, and wise Party, a Party that grasps the laws of the development of things, and a Party with scientific foresight. The technical innovation and technical revolution reached a climax at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The Party put forward this call long ago based on the urgent desire of China's 600 million people to change the state of "poverty and blankness." After the continuous development of production in recent years, the vast people of our country, under the leadership of the Party, have confidently established lofty ambitions to quickly catch up with or surpass capitalist countries in industry, to push our country's production technology level to a peak, to liberate more labor force, and to realize a great leap forward in production. The Party guided this movement to a climax in a timely manner, and thus astonishing achievements quickly appeared.

Second, technology and production must have the leadership of the Party. In the past, I also had this wrong idea: the Party is good at leading politics, but not necessarily at leading production, especially science and technology. But in the deeds of technical innovation and technical revolution that I saw with my own eyes this time, which one was not achieved under the leadership of the Party? Isn't this movement precisely about engaging in production, science, and technology? Another idea was that "the Party may not know more about technology than I do." Is this the reality? In this movement, I saw that from the central government to every enterprise, the Party not only led the masses on how to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, but also clearly put forward the goals of struggle, specific measures, and so on. The Party is indeed much wiser than our technical personnel. The reason is very simple, the Party follows the mass line, the wisdom and experience of the masses is the wisdom and experience of the Party, and the wisdom and experience of the masses is infinite and inexhaustible, so the Party is erudite and omnipotent, so how can the Party not lead science and technology?

I also had this idea: technical innovation and technical revolution are the business of technical personnel. This is a kind of technical mysticism, a bourgeois expert thought, and in essence a manifestation of distrust in the wisdom of the masses. Is technology so mysterious? From the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in several major cities in the Northeast, it can be seen that in one or two months, an average of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of technical innovation proposals were made in each city. In industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, education, health, and even financial and trade departments, there was a scene of technical innovation and technical revolution everywhere. Participants included workers, farmers, cadres, residents, housewives, etc. Every line had inventions, and everyone had creations. A "March 8th Women's Restaurant" in Harbin, as a result of one month's innovation, almost all the main labor was mechanized, achieving "no need to speak when ordering food, no need to walk when delivering food, no need to use hands when cutting vegetables, and calculating accounts by pressing a button." Even the aunties in the nurseries, in order to discover in time that a child had wet the bed in their sleep, invented a "urine alarm." Housewives working in the streets also engaged in simple telephone communication equipment, and held telephone conferences using telephone lines and telephones made by themselves. If technology is really so mysterious, then how to explain these facts? In a word, the frog at the bottom of the well has a limited view.

The Party's leadership of this movement is not only relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, but more importantly, arming the minds of the masses with the theory of continuous revolution. From what I saw in the Northeast, the key to every technical innovation is not in the technical problem, but in the ideological problem. Those "conservative," "superstitious," "wait-and-see," "experiential," "complacent" factions, especially the "one-hit wonders," "arrogant," and "dogmatic" thoughts of some intellectuals, are precisely the stumbling blocks hindering the progress of the movement. The Party resolutely fights against these old ideas, and at the same time vigorously promotes the style of "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act," cultivating new seedlings, so that the movement can develop healthily and rapidly. "Technical revolution must first have ideological revolution." Technical revolution must emphasize the combination of three factors. Without the leadership of the Party, technical revolution leaving the leadership of the Party, leaving political command, leaving the large-scale mass movement, there will never be any achievements.

Third, the qualities of the working class are the most excellent. In the past, my understanding of the phrase "learning from the working class" was very abstract. Through this visit, I have a more concrete and deeper understanding of the excellent qualities of the working class.

(1) The working class's unparalleled support and love for the Party, and their selfless labor enthusiasm for socialist construction, are particularly moving. In the Northeast, such slogans can be seen everywhere: "As long as the Party says a word, no matter how great the difficulties are, we are not afraid." Why do workers love the Party so much? This is because the Party led the workers to liberation from the three great mountains pressing on their heads and changed their political status. In this movement, the workers are saying again: mechanization is another time that the Communist Party has liberated them from heavy physical labor. They deeply feel that every movement of the Communist Party is for the benefit of the working class. The Communist Party has a flesh-and-blood relationship with the workers. Therefore, it is easy to understand why workers respond so enthusiastically to every call of the Party, and their enthusiasm is particularly great. Of course, their sense of responsibility as masters is also a great driving force. During our visit, we constantly heard that many workers were unwilling to go home during the Spring Festival in order to engage in technical innovation, and were unwilling to leave the workshop at night. Some were temporarily persuaded by the Party committee secretary, but those who bought train tickets home returned them, and those who left the front door of the workshop entered through the back door. Some workers in Harbin took their work home, finished it quietly, and sent it back. They said: "Neither for fame nor for profit, just to be an unsung hero for socialism." I felt really ashamed when I heard this. I am treated so well by the Party and the country, but I still often plan for personal gains and losses. This shows that my world view must be transformed more quickly.

A slogan of the workers' comrades says it well:

Working hard, working practically, and working skillfully, the workers' enthusiasm breaks through the sky;
If you ask where the energy comes from, the Party's leadership is the source.

I am determined to learn from the workers, first of all to learn from the workers to obey the leadership of the Party and listen to the Party wholeheartedly.

(2) The working class has the noble character of selflessness and altruism. In the Northeast, in order to support fraternal factories, many factories sent out their best workers, lent out the best tools, and gave up the main equipment. For example, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant gave the first high-efficiency press it made to another factory for use first. Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant not only supported Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant with technical force, but also helped them quickly catch up with their own production scale. Although this movement has a competitive nature, I have never seen or heard of any unit attacking other units in order to elevate itself. In fact, a new morality and a new atmosphere have formed throughout the society, that is, "go to the front when encountering difficulties, give way to honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." This style is a stark contrast to my past "retaining one's skills" and "localism" thinking.

(3) The working class demonstrated the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. "Daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act" is the most prominent performance of the workers we saw in the Northeast this time. In the past, we were oppressed by imperialism and could not hold our heads high, which almost made us lose our national self-confidence and self-esteem. We felt that we could not do this or that. The Party made us break superstition. The workers' leading "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act" drove thousands of people to use their brains and offer suggestions. Now the workers feel that what foreigners can do, we can definitely do; what foreigners cannot do, we can also do. What lofty ambitions this is. The employees of Dalian Shipyard, unwilling to be threatened by arrogant capitalist agents, were determined to design and manufacture China's first 5,000-horsepower diesel engine themselves, which is a very typical example.

Why didn't I dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act like the workers? In the final analysis, it is still a matter of world view. The most important thing is to first eliminate the concept of personal gain and loss. Only in this way can we truly establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.

The above are some superficial experiences I gained from my visit to the Northeast regarding the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Due to my low theoretical level, my understanding may not be correct, and I hope that the committee members will correct me.

Finally, I express: I will resolutely hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, accelerate ideological transformation, and do my best to fight for technical innovation and technical revolution!

### 学习工人阶级的优秀品质  黄振勋委员的发言

    学习工人阶级的优秀品质
    黄振勋委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理“关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告以后，我衷心拥护，我并完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会常委会的工作报告，对我国伟大的继续大跃进感到无限的兴奋。
    我国1959年国民经济建设取得了震动世界的伟大成就；1960年的国民经济计划，又来一个更全面的继续大跃进，这标志着毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，党的英明、正确领导的伟大胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝深入人心的伟大胜利！
    1960年继续大跃进的计划，我深信必定会实现！正如李副总理所指出，目前在全国已形成的学习毛泽东思想和大闹技术革新、技术革命运动的高潮。这是引导我们从胜利走向胜利的最有力保证。
    在这次会议前，我荣幸地获得了参观我国东北工业基地的机会。在那里，每一个角落都像李副总理所说的，正以万马奔腾之势，开展着技术革新、技术革命运动。我亲眼看到，东北工业面貌又有了一个崭新的改变，许多手工操作已经大多机械化和半机械化，机械化的已经走向自动化或半自动化，无论在哪一个工业部门，都已经普遍地减少甚至消灭了笨重的体力劳动。从而使生产建设速度大大提高，生产加番，效率加倍，甚至提高几倍、几十倍，而且增产不增人，已是普遍的现象。哈尔滨一个人民公社的工厂生产乙酸乙酯，改革了工艺，产量增加六百四十倍，而且还要继续提高。起初，我以为小厂潜力容易挖，那知最大、最现代化的厂，如长春第一汽车厂，鞍钢的无缝钢管厂、型钢厂等，产量也翻了好几番，并且向一厂变四厂、五厂的豪迈目标前进着。东北技术革新、技术革命运动的效果，不仅表现在速度上，还表现在技术水平的提高上。当我看见正在制造中的大连造船厂的万吨以上巨轮等，使我深深地感到我国工业水平已经走进了世界先进行列。高、大、精、尖、新的技术或产品，现在已不是学习掌握的问题，而是已经进入创造性的独立发展的新阶段了。
    技术革新和技术革命运动好比万紫千红的鲜花，现在正在我们辽阔的国土上遍地开放，并且不断地结出累累的果实。它不仅是推动我国生产力的源泉，也是社会主义教育的绝好教材。下面谈一谈我个人从这次参观中所得到的教育和体会：
    一、中国共产党是伟大的正确的英明的党，是掌握事物发展规律的党，是具有科学预见的党。技术革新、技术革命在去年年底和今年年初已经达到了高潮。党根据我国六亿多人民迫切要求改变“一穷二白”的愿望早就提出了这个号召。经过近年来生产的不断发展，我国广大人民在党的领导下，满怀信心地树立了雄心壮志，要在工业上迅速地赶上或超过资本主义国家，要把我国的生产技术水平推向高峰，要解放更多的劳动力，实现生产大跃进。党及时引导这个运动走向高潮，因而很快地出现了惊人的成就。
    二、技术和生产必须有党的领导。过去我也曾有过这种错误想法：党领导政治是能手，但领导生产，特别是科学技术，则未必如此。但在我这次亲眼看到的技术革新、技术革命的事迹中，哪一件不是在党的领导下才取得成功的？难道这个运动不正是搞生产、搞科学、搞技术吗？还有一个想法是“党对技术未必比我知道得多。”事实是这样的吗？在这个运动中，我见到从中央到每个企业，党不仅领导群众怎样去进行技术革新、技术革命，而且还很明确地提出奋斗的目标、具体措施等等。党的确比我们技术人员高明得多。说起来道理很简单，党是走群众路线的，群众的智慧、经验，就是党的智慧和经验，而群众的智慧和经验是无穷无尽、永不枯竭的，因而党是博学多才、无所不能的，这样难道党还不能领导科学技术吗？
    我还有过这样的想法：技术革新和技术革命是技术人员的事。这是一种技术神秘论，是资产阶级专家思想，实质上是一种不相信群众智慧的表现。技术是否那么神秘呢？从东北几个大城市的技术革新和技术革命运动中可以看到，在一、两个月中，平均每个城市有几万件到几十万件的技术革新建议，在工业、农业、交通运输、文教卫生以至财贸部门，到处是一片技术革新、技术革命景象，参加的人有工人、农民、干部、居民、家庭妇女等等，行行都有发明，人人都有创造。哈尔滨有一家“三八妇女饭店”，一个月革新的结果，几乎使全部主要劳动都实现了机械化，做到了“叫菜不用口，送菜不用走，切菜不用手，算账按电钮”。甚至托儿所的阿姨，为了及时地发现小孩在睡梦中尿了床，也发明了“报尿器”。街道工作的家庭妇女们，也大搞简单的电话通讯设备，用自己亲手搞起来的电话线和电话机召开电话会议。如果说，技术真的很神秘，那又怎样来解释这些事实呢？一句话，“井底之蛙”，所见是有限的。
    党领导这个运动，不仅是依靠群众，发动群众，更重要的是思想上以不断革命的理论来武装群众的头脑。从东北所见来说，每个技术革新的关键，并不在于技术问题，而是在于思想问题。像那些“保守派”、“迷信派”、“观潮派”、“经验派”、“自满派”，特别是有些知识分子的“一鸣惊人”、“自高自大”、“教条主义”等形形色色的思想，正是阻碍运动进展的绊脚石。党是坚决地和这些旧思想作斗争，同时大力地发扬那些“敢想敢说敢干”的作风，培植新的幼芽，使运动能健康地迅速地发展。“技术革命，必须先有思想革命”。技术革命必须强调三结合。技术离开党的领导，技术革命离开党的领导，离开政治挂帅，离开大搞群众运动，是绝不会有任何成就的。
    三、工人阶级的品质是最优秀的。过去我对向“工人阶级学习”这句话，是了解得很抽象的。通过这次参观，我对工人阶级的优秀品质才有了比较具体和比较深刻的了解。
    （一）工人阶级对党的无比拥护和热爱，对社会主义建设的忘我劳动热情，特别令人感动。在东北，到处可以看见这样的标语：“只要党说一句话，天大困难也不怕”。为什么工人会这样热爱党呢？这是因为党领导工人从压在他们头上的三座大山底下得到了解放，改变了他们的政治地位。在这次运动中，工人又在说：机械化是共产党再一次把他们从笨重体力劳动中解放出来。他们已深深感到共产党的每一个运动都是为了工人阶级利益。共产党与工人有血肉关系。因此容易理解为什么工人对党的每一个号召是那样热烈的响应，干劲也特别大。当然，他们的主人翁责任感也是一个极大的推动力。我们在参观中，不断听说，许多工人为了搞技术革新，春节不愿回家，晚上不肯离车间，有的虽然被党委书记暂时说服了，但买了回家车票的又退票，出了车间前门的又从后门进。哈尔滨有些工人把工作带回家，作好了悄悄地送回去，他们说：“一不为名，二不为利，只为社会主义当个无名英雄”。我听了真是感到惭愧。我受党和国家那样厚待，还时常为个人得失打算，这说明我的世界观必须加速改造。
    工人同志的一条标语说得好：
    苦干实干加巧干，工人干劲冲破天；
    要问劲头何处来，党的领导是泉源。
    我坚决地要向工人学习，首先学习工人服从党的领导，一心一意听党的话。
      （二）工人阶级具有舍己为人大公无私的高贵品德。在东北，有许多厂为了支援兄弟厂，派出了自己厂里最优秀的工人，借出了最好的工具，让出了主要的器材，例如沈阳重型机厂把自己制出的第一台高效压力机先供给别的厂使用，哈尔滨量具刃具厂，不仅从技术力量上支援了成都量具刃具厂，还帮助他们很快的赶过自己的生产规模，尽管这个运动含有竞赛的性质，但从未见到或听到任何单位为了抬高自己而打击别的单位。事实上整个社会已形成了一种新的道德、新风气，那就是“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”。这种风格对我过去，那种“保留一手”和“本位主义”思想是何等鲜明的对比。
    （三）工人阶级表现了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。“敢想、敢说、敢干”是我们这次在东北看到的工人最突出的表现。过去我们被帝国主义压迫得抬不起头，几乎使我们失掉民族的自信心和自尊心，觉得我们这样不行，那样不行。党使我们破除了迷信。工人一马当先的“敢想敢说敢干”，带动了成千成万的人开动脑筋，献计献策。现在工人都感到外国能做的，我们一定能做到；外国不能做到的，我们也可以做到，这是何等的雄心壮志。大连造船厂员工在不甘受资本主义代理商盛气凌人的要挟下决心自己设计、自己制造中国第一台五千马力柴油机就是一个很典型的例子。
    为什么我没有像工人那样敢想敢说敢干呢？归根结底还是一个世界观问题。最重要的是首先要把个人得失观念去掉。只有这样才说得上真正树立起敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。
    以上是我去东北参观中获得的关于技术革新、技术革命运动的一些肤浅体会。由于我的理论水平低，认识不一定正确，希望各位委员予以指正。
    最后，我表示：要坚决地高举毛泽东思想红旗，加速思想改造，尽我最大的努力，为技术革新和技术革命而奋斗！
