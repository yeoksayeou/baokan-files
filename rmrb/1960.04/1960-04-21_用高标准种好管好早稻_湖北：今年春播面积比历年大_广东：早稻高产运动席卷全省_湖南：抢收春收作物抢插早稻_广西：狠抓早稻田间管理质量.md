    Cultivate and Manage Early Rice Well with High Standards
    Hubei: Spring planting area this year is larger than in previous years. Guangdong: Early rice high-yield campaign sweeps across the province.
    Hunan: Rush to harvest spring crops and rush to transplant early rice. Guangxi: Vigorously grasp the quality of early rice field management.
    (Our report) A mass movement to complete the spring planting task according to area, quality, and season has taken shape throughout Hubei Province.
    Hubei Province's spring planting area this year is larger than in previous years. Among them, the early rice area is 8 million mu, an increase of more than 20% over the actual harvested area last year; the total sown area of ​​coarse grains and various cash crops will also be larger than last year. This year's spring planting quality requirements are also higher than in previous years. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to achieve "three concentrations" (leadership concentration, labor concentration, material concentration) to go all out to ensure the completion of the spring planting task.
    Up to now, the province has concentrated more than 6 million laborers to the front line of spring planting, accounting for about 60% of the entire rural labor force. At the same time, various localities have also divided the remaining labor force into first, second, and third lines. The second line is responsible for growing vegetables, raising pigs, processing rice and flour, and running canteens well to ensure that the vast number of commune members are well-fed; the third line vigorously engages in sideline occupations, fisheries, and animal husbandry production, so as to highlight the center and take care of all aspects.
    During this period, cadres at all levels from counties and communes to production teams went to the front line of spring plowing and planting, went deep into the fields, conducted experiments, took the lead in innovation, and promptly discovered and solved problems. An Haitian, the first secretary of the Suixian County Party Committee, went deep into the Bayi Production Team of the Lishan Commune and found that the team's labor force was not concentrated enough. He discussed with the masses and quickly increased the strength of the spring planting front line. Jingzhou, Huanggang, Wuhan and other regions also adopted the method of cadres at all levels meeting in the fields and contracting with the relatively backward production teams to strengthen the leadership of these teams.
    At present, the province has completed the sowing of early rice and is starting the sowing of intermediate rice on a large scale. The sowing of coarse grains and cash crops has been grasped earlier and better than in any year. The province plans to sow more than 8 million mu of cotton. As of the beginning of April, 6.77 million mu have been sown, an increase of seven or eight times over the sown area in the same period last year. Xiangyang, Yidu, Enshi, Jingzhou and other regions plan to sow more than 2.7 million mu of corn, and 2 million mu have now been sown. The sowing speed is also much faster than in the same period last year.
    (Our report from) Hunan Province: The "Double Rush" (rushing to harvest spring crops and rush to transplant early rice) battle has begun. More than 15 million rural laborers in the province are striving to complete the task of rushing to harvest spring crops and rush to transplant early rice in six to ten days. These important agricultural activities are concentrated in mid-to-late April. In order to solve the contradiction of tight labor, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee took the following measures:
    1. The sowing of dryland miscellaneous grain crops, which used to be carried out at the same time as early rice transplanting every year, was completed earlier before early rice transplanting. This can stagger the intense labor during the busy season and avoid the threat of autumn drought, ensuring more varieties and earlier harvests. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities started sowing dryland miscellaneous grain crops early from the end of February. Now, 12 million mu of dryland miscellaneous grain crops in the province were sown before transplanting in mid-March, one month to forty days earlier than in previous years, and the area was doubled compared with last year. After completing this task, various localities freed up their hands to grasp the later cultivation and management of spring crops and prepare for early rice transplanting. 2. All the province's 15 million mu of spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed are processed and cultivated to make them mature and harvested early. Up to now, various localities have carried out three or four cultivations and topdressing of spring crops, which are generally growing well. More than 20 million mu of green manure have been universally ditched for drainage and topdressing. More than 90% are first-class seedlings. 3. Various localities have also done a good job in preparing for early rice transplanting. Party secretaries at all levels throughout the province led nearly one million seedling raising experts, weathermen, and insect pest forecasters to form professional seedling raising teams, eating and sleeping by the seedling fields, fighting against cold waves and insect pests day and night.
    Under the slogan of "Advance all work forward," all localities in Hunan advanced all farm work that could be done in advance. The movement to plow fields in advance started as early as the beginning of March, quickly making 19 million mu of paddy fields for spring crops three plows and three harrows. After completing this farm work in advance, we can concentrate manpower and animal power to transplant rice after the spring crops are harvested. The province has manufactured more than 500,000 rice transplanters and trained 1.12 million skilled users of rice transplanters to ensure that the transplanting work is done quickly and well.
    During the "Double Rush" period, all localities took running the canteen well as the center, comprehensively and properly arranged the lives of commune members, and ensured the smooth completion of the "Double Rush" task.
    (Our report from) Guangzhou, 20th: After Guangdong Province basically completed early rice transplanting before the Qingming Festival, a mass movement to strive for high yields of early rice quickly swept across the province.
    The goal of the early rice high-yield campaign is: 1,000 catties per mu. At present, the focus of the high-yield campaign is to implement technical measures such as rational fertilization, rational irrigation and drainage, and elimination of diseases and insect pests more carefully, comprehensively, and with higher standards. After the Shantou area launched the high-yield campaign, the daily accumulation of fertilizer suddenly increased by 40%, and weeding, weeding, and fertilization were accelerated by 100%, and most of them met high standards. Various counties in the Jiangmen area conducted specific research and analysis on the requirements of high standards, and proposed five-character measures for early, fast, precise, complete, and good field management. Therefore, the seedlings returned to green and tillered quickly. Many communes in the province have established field archives and agronomist management systems in high-yield areas, making the implementation of various high-standard technical measures more precise and comprehensive.
    The momentum, scope, speed of action, and area of ​​the Guangdong Province's early rice high-yield campaign all exceeded any previous year. At present, the early rice 1,000-catty high-yield areas determined by people's communes throughout the province account for 32% of the total early rice area. Many high-yield areas have surpassed the scope of a production brigade, a commune, or even a county. The prefectural party committee, county party committee, and commune party committee specially organized the command organizations of each high-yield area to conduct unified leadership and cooperate with each other. The Rongjiang River downstream in the Chaoshan Plain has a high-yield area of ​​300,000 mu, which is jointly operated by nine communes in Jieyang County, three communes in Chaoyang County, and one commune in Puning County. This year, the province has a total of 7.5 million mu of low-yield fields. The soil has been comprehensively improved, and professional teams have been organized to manage low-yield fields to turn them into high-yield areas. While vigorously developing high-yield areas for early rice, various localities are also managing large areas of high-yield areas for sweet potatoes, sugar cane, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables.
    The high-yield areas determined throughout the province are mostly fields with better basic farmland construction and systematic implementation of the Eight-Character Constitution. Since the beginning of preparation for farming, various localities have specially processed high-yield areas, and initially carried out deep plowing and soil improvement, leveling the land, reorganizing the irrigation and drainage system, and building field roads according to the standards of garden fields; more base fertilizer was applied; all good varieties were selected, and the seeds were disinfected, and strong seedlings were cultivated; most of the rice was transplanted before the "Vernal Equinox", and the transplanting specifications were better than ordinary fields.
    (Our report from) Guangxi: Guangxi mobilized 5 million laborers to carry out a high-quality, high-efficiency field management campaign, striving for a bumper harvest in the first season.
    This year, due to the unprecedented expansion of the planting area of ​​early rice, spring corn, etc. in Guangxi, the workload in the field has also increased accordingly. In order to ensure increased production, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee recently required all localities to launch a high-quality, high-efficiency field management upsurge. Ningming County, the first county in the entire autonomous region to complete early rice transplanting, clearly put forward the struggle goal of striving for "one tael of grain per rice seedling, four taels of grain per corn plant, and three catties of cassava" in early March. In field management, this county adopted ten measures including soaking, burning, planting, raising, digging, piling, harvesting, shoveling, sweeping, and manufacturing to accumulate fertilizer in large quantities to ensure that crops are fed and watered. At present, the county's 270,000 mu of early rice has ended the second weeding and topdressing. Generally, there are 250,000 to 350,000 seedlings per mu, and the seedlings are about one and a half feet high; 260,000 mu of corn have been cultivated and topdressed twice, and early-maturing varieties have now blossomed and tasseled; 800,000 mu of cassava, sugar cane, and peanuts have also undergone one to two cultivations and topdressing; Guidongnan Plain, the main rice-producing area, this year proposed that the yield per mu of first-class seedlings should reach 800 to 1,000 catties or more. Cangwu, Cenxi and other counties in the Wuzhou area have universally established a network for reporting agricultural conditions, vigorously engaged in the "experimental field" for eliminating third-class seedlings, and strived to make every seedling first-class.
    According to the practice of successive years of bumper harvests, the method of "grasping both ends and bringing the middle" in field management is a successful experience. While vigorously grasping bumper harvest fields and pioneer fields, various localities have organized a group of crack troops to manage low-yield fields. The "Five Rush" movement of mountain and valley fields catching up with large fields, distant fields catching up with nearby fields, lean fields catching up with fertile fields, seedling fields catching up with native fields, and late-transplanted fields catching up with early-transplanted fields newly launched in the Yulin area has spread to every corner. Cenxi County in the Wuzhou area has developed the experience of vigorously developing bumper harvest fields and turn-over fields (low-yield turning into high-yield) last year into large-area, connected-area experimental fields. The county has established a total of more than 70,000 mu of bumper harvest areas and more than 100,000 mu of turn-over areas. There are more than 15,000 cadres in various communes who are in charge of turn-over fields.

    用高标准种好管好早稻
    湖北：今年春播面积比历年大　广东：早稻高产运动席卷全省
    湖南：抢收春收作物抢插早稻　广西：狠抓早稻田间管理质量
    本报讯　湖北省按面积、按质量、按季节完成春种任务的群众运动已经在全省范围内形成。
    湖北省今年春播面积比历年都大。其中早稻面积八百万亩，比去年实收面积扩大20％以上；杂粮和各类经济作物的播种总面积，也将大于去年。今年春播质量要求也比往年高。湖北省委要求各地做到“三集中”（领导集中、劳力集中、物资集中），全力以赴确保春播任务的完成。
    到目前为止，全省已经集中到春种第一线的劳动力达六百多万人，大约占整个农村劳动力的60％强。同时，各地还把余下的劳动力划分为第二线和第三线。第二线专管种菜、养猪、米面加工，办好食堂，使广大社员吃饱吃好；第三线大搞副业、渔业和畜牧业生产，做到既突出中心，又照顾全面。
    在这个时期，从县、公社到生产队各级干部，纷纷奔赴春耕春种第一线，深入田间，大搞试验，带头革新，及时发现和解决问题。中共随县县委第一书记安海田深入到厉山公社八一生产队，发现这个队劳力使用很不集中，便和群众研究，迅速增加了春播第一线的力量。荆州、黄冈、武汉等地区还采用各级干部会师田间，深入到比较落后的生产队包干的办法，加强对这些队的领导。
    目前湖北全省早稻播种已结束，正大规模地开始中稻播种，杂粮和经济作物的播种工作，比任何一年都抓得早、抓得好，全省计划播种八百多万亩棉花，到4月上旬止，已播六百七十七万亩，比去年同期播种面积增加了七、八倍。襄阳、宜都、恩施、荆州等地区计划播种玉米二百七十多万亩，现已播下二百万亩，播种速度也比去年同期快得多。
    本报讯　湖南省“双抢”（抢收春收作物和抢插早稻）战斗开始了。全省一千五百多万农村劳动力，力争在六天到十天的时间内，突击完成抢收春收作物、抢插早稻的任务。这些重要的农事活动都集中在4月中、下旬，为了解决劳力紧张的矛盾，中共湖南省委采取了以下措施：
    一、把历年都要和早稻插秧同时进行的旱土杂粮作物播种工作，提早在早稻插秧前完成。这样可以错开大忙时节的紧张劳动，又可避开秋旱的威胁，保证多种早收。各地根据省委指示，从2月底开始就提早播种旱土杂粮作物，现在全省一千二百万亩旱土杂粮作物，在3月中旬插秧前播种完毕，比往年提早了一个月到四十天，面积也比去年扩大一倍。完成了这项工作，各地就腾出手来，一手抓春收作物的后期培育管理，一手抓早稻插秧前的准备工作。二、对于全省一千五百多万亩小麦、油菜等春收作物，都加工培育，使其早熟早收。到目前止，各地对春收作物都进行三、四次中耕追肥，一般生长良好。两千多万亩绿肥普遍进行了开沟沥水和追施肥料，90％以上是一类苗。三、各地对早稻插秧前的准备工作也做得很好。全省各级党委书记，带领近百万育秧能手、气象员、虫情预报员，组成专业育秧组，在秧田边吃饭睡觉，日夜与寒潮、虫害搏斗。
    在“一切工夫向前赶”的行动口号下，湖南各地把一切能提前做的农活都提前。提前翻田的运动早在3月上旬就开始了，很快使一千九百多万亩种春收作物的水田，做到三犁三耙。这项农活提前做完，就可以在春收作物收割之后，集中人力牛力插秧。全省已制造插秧机五十多万部，训练了使用插秧机能手一百一十二万人，保证插秧工作做得又快又好。
    在双抢期间，各地都以办好食堂为中心，全面妥善安排社员生活，保证双抢任务顺利进行。
    本报广州20日电　广东省提早在清明节基本完成早稻插秧后，争取早稻高产的群众运动迅速席卷全省。
    早稻高产运动的目标是：亩产千斤。目前，高产运动的中心在于更精细、更全面、更高标准地贯彻合理施肥、合理排灌、消灭病虫害等技术措施。汕头专区掀起高产运动后，每天积肥数量突增四成，中耕、除草、施肥加快一倍，并且大都符合高标准的要求。江门专区各县对高标准的要求进行了具体的研究分析，提出田间管理早、快、精、全、好的五字措施，按高标准边插边管，因此禾苗回青分蘖很快。全省许多公社在高产片建立田头档案和农艺师管理制度，使各项高标准技术措施贯彻得更加精细全面。
    广东省早稻高产运动的气势之猛，范围之广，行动之快，面积之大，都超过了以往任何一年。目前，全省各人民公社已确定经营的早稻千斤高产片，占早稻总面积的32％。许多高产片超越了一个生产大队、一个公社以至一个县的范围，由地委、县委和公社党委专门组织各个高产片的指挥机构，进行统一领导，互相协作。潮汕平原榕江下游有一个面积达三十万亩的高产片，是由揭阳县九个公社、潮阳县三个公社、普宁县一个公社协作经营的。全省今年共有七百五十万亩低产田经过综合改良土壤，组织了专业队经营低产田，要把它变成高产片。各地在大搞早稻高产片的同时，还经营大面积的红薯、甘蔗、花生、水果、蔬菜等高产片。
    全省确定的高产片，大都是农田基本建设比较好和系统地贯彻了八字宪法的田。从备耕开始，各地便对高产片特别加工，初步按园田化标准进行深翻改土、平整土地、整理排灌系统、修筑田间道路；基肥下得多；全部选用良种，种子经过消毒处理，育成壮秧；绝大部分在“春分”前便插完秧，插秧规格也比一般田好。
    本报讯　广西集中五百万劳动力，开展高质量、高工效的田间管理运动，力争上造取得大丰收。
    今年广西由于早稻、春玉米等种植面积空前扩大，田间工作量也相应增多。为了确保增产，中共广西僮族自治区党委最近要求各地掀起一个高质量、高工效的田间管理高潮。全自治区第一个插完早稻的宁明县，在3月上旬就明确提出争取“一兜禾苗一两谷，一株玉米四两粒，一棵木薯三斤重”的奋斗目标。在田间管理工作中，这个县采取沤、烧、种、养、挖、堆、收、铲、扫、制十大措施大积肥料，保证庄稼吃饱喝足。现在，全县二十七万亩早稻已结束了第二次耘田追肥，一般每亩有苗二十五万至三十五万株，苗高一尺五寸左右；二十六万亩玉米已培土追肥两次，早熟品种现已扬花结苞；八十多万亩木薯、甘蔗、花生，也进行了一次至两次的中耕追肥；水稻主要产区的桂东南平原，今年提出了一类禾苗的每亩产量达八百至一千斤以上。梧州专区苍梧、岑溪等县，普遍建立了农情检查报告网，大搞消灭三类禾“试验田”，力促块块禾苗一类化。
    根据连年丰产的实践证明，在田间管理中“抓两头、带中间”的方法，是一条成功的经验。各地在大抓丰产田、先锋垌的同时，都组织了一批精兵强将，专管低产田。玉林专区新掀起的山冲田赶大垌田、远田赶近田、瘦田赶肥田、秧田赶本田、迟插田赶早插田的“五赶”运动，已遍及各个角落。梧州专区岑溪县把去年大搞丰产垌、翻身垌（低产变高产）的经验，发展成为大面积的连垌成片的试验田。全县共建立丰产区七万多亩，翻身区十万多亩。各公社专管翻身垌的干部达一万五千多人。
