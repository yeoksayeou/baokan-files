How to Dig Channel Fields

The so-called corn channel field ridge cultivation involves digging channels in the cultivated land and cultivating corn in the channels. The specifications of the channel fields should be adapted to local conditions. Generally, the channel width is 1.5 to 1.8 feet, the channel depth is deeply ploughed about 1 foot, and the distance between channels is 1.5 to 1.8 feet. In order to deeply plough without disturbing the soil layers, a three-layer operation method is adopted to dig the channels. The method is: when digging the first channel, first pour the topsoil on the edge of the field, dig the second layer of soil on the back of the next channel, loosen the third layer of soil in place, and then apply base fertilizer. Then dig the second channel, and the method is to put the first layer of topsoil in the previous channel, put the second layer of soil on the back of the next channel, loosen the third layer of soil in place, and apply base fertilizer; and so on, to form channel fields. Sowing is carried out by digging nests and planting seeds. In order to weather the soil, channel fields should be dug as early as possible. It is most suitable to dig after the autumn harvest and before the ground freezes. It is also possible to dig before spring sowing, but it should be slightly shallower.

    怎样挖渠田
    所谓玉米渠田垅作，要在耕地里开一道一道的渠沟，在渠沟里培植玉米。渠田规格，因地制宜。一般是渠宽一尺五至一尺八寸，渠沟深翻一尺左右，渠与渠之间的距离是一尺五到一尺八寸。为了做到深翻不乱土层，采取三层操作法挖渠，方法是：挑第一道渠时，把第一层土先倒在地边上，第二层土掘在下一渠的渠背上，第三层土就地挖虚，然后施入底肥。接着挖第二道渠沟，挖法是把第一层熟土放在前一道渠沟内，第二层土放在下一渠的渠背上，就地挖虚第三层土，施入底肥；依此类推，即成渠田。播种实行刨窝下种。为了使土壤风化，挑挖渠田要及早进行，在秋收后上冻前最适宜，开春播种以前挑挖也行，但要稍浅一些。
