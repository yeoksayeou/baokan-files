Seoul: Half a Million People Demonstrate Demanding Syngman Rhee Step Down
Japan: Seven Million People Demonstrate Against the U.S.-Japan Treaty

This newspaper reports that the flames of the South Korean people's struggle against the fascist rule of the U.S.-Rhee group are burning ever brighter. On the 26th, half a million people in Seoul held a large-scale demonstration, surrounded Syngman Rhee's residence, and tore down Syngman Rhee's bronze statue, dragging it around. They also seized six tanks sent by the Syngman Rhee group to suppress them and attacked armories. Demonstrators also shouted slogans in front of the U.S. Embassy, demanding that Syngman Rhee step down.

On the same day, in Busan, more than 60,000 demonstrators destroyed a large number of Syngman Rhee regime's "government offices" and police stations. In Daegu, more than 30,000 people stormed into the Gyeongsangbuk-do "Provincial Government" office building, forcing the Syngman Rhee "Provincial Governor" and the Daegu "Mayor" to write "letters of resignation" on the spot and step down. Mass demonstrations also broke out in Incheon, Masan, Daejeon, Yeosu, Ulsan, Miryang, Jinju and other places.

In the face of the massive people's demonstration, Syngman Rhee was forced to express his "willingness to resign." American interventionists are stepping up their use of two-faced tactics in an attempt to maintain their colonial rule in South Korea. (Detailed report on page five)

This newspaper reports that the Japanese people have launched a new high tide in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." On the 26th, seven million people across Japan held unprecedented large-scale petitions and demonstrations.

The Japanese working class, which has always been at the forefront of the struggle, took the lead. Three million six hundred thousand workers held strikes and rallies across the country to oppose the Japanese Diet's ratification of the "New Security Treaty."

In Tokyo, a petitioning team of 100,000 people surged towards the Diet like a tidal wave. Petitioners wore sashes or headbands with slogans such as "Oppose the Diet's ratification of the 'Security Treaty'!" "Down with the Nobusuke Kishi government!" "Dissolve the Diet immediately!" After submitting their petitions to the Diet members, they held demonstrations around the Diet, government office buildings, and the central district of Tokyo.

On the same day, 12,000 representatives from all over the country held a central general mobilization rally in Tokyo to oppose the Diet's ratification of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." (Detailed report on page five)
