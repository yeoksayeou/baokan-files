Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Rural commune industries across the country are vigorously engaging in the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, providing a large amount of raw materials for light industry, saving a large amount of transportation capacity, and improving the lives of commune members.

China's rural sideline products and various wild resources are extremely rich. Since the beginning of this year, many people's communes, in order to make full use of agricultural resources and effectively expand the sources of raw materials for light industry, have specifically established offices or groups for the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products and wild resources. These communes have grasped the characteristics of agricultural and sideline products, which are seasonal, geographically dispersed, difficult to store for a long time, and unsuitable for long-distance transportation, and have adopted various methods such as combining year-round processing with seasonal rushes, combining centralized management with decentralized processing, combining fixed processing with mobile processing, and combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, forming a network of processing facilities scattered across the landscape in accordance with local conditions. Individual areas have begun to see relatively complete "one-stop" processing systems. For example, the Ci'an Oil and Cotton Factory in Cixian County, Hebei, has built a complete processing system that closely integrates various processing links such as ginning, linting, oil extraction, refining, soap making, and winemaking. This has greatly increased the potential of the equipment. The plant's output value and labor productivity have increased rapidly by more than 60%, and a large amount of manpower and materials have also been saved. The Lindian County People's Commune in Heilongjiang Province has established more than 1,000 processing plants of various types, such as pulp, alcohol, tannin, wild fiber, furfural, aromatic oil, and alkaline soil, and has initially formed ten processing networks (dragons), providing 570 tons of chemical raw materials such as potassium salt and alkaline soil for light industry and chemical industry, and 3,000 dan of pulp and cardboard for the paper industry within two months. This experience of the "one-stop" processing industry has been proven to be a good way to vigorously develop the processing industry and strengthen comprehensive utilization in a faster, better, and more economical manner, and is highly valued by relevant departments and is being promoted throughout the country.

There are many benefits to developing the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. People's communes that have already started this work can ensure that highly seasonal agricultural and sideline products are processed in a timely manner, providing more raw materials for large-scale industry; at the same time, because it is processed locally, it can also save a lot of transportation capacity and packaging materials. The commune-run industries in Zhejiang Province use bitter bamboo, corn stalks, orange leaves, etc. to process more than 60,000 tons of pulp and more than 2,000 tons of aromatic oil, supplying cities such as Shanghai. People's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai have established a large number of small pulp mills, processing rice straw into pulp, and then transporting it to Shanghai as paper-making raw materials. In order to provide raw materials for the flax textile industry, the Shulu County People's Commune in Hebei Province organized commune members to strip all the cotton stalks produced from 780,000 mu of cotton fields in a few days. The development of the processing industry is not only of great benefit to industrial production, but also the remaining residues and by-products after initial processing can be used as pig feed and fertilizer, and to extract pesticides, accelerating agricultural production and the development of animal husbandry. Almost all food processing plants are currently producing pig feed. While many processing plants are using sesame stalks, cotton shells, bean stalks, corn cobs, and many domestic and wild plants to produce oils and chemical raw materials, they are using residues and waste liquids as pig feed and fertilizer, or to extract pesticides.

Since the commune industry in various places developed the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, it has expanded the scope of resource utilization to varying degrees. Some local people's communes have effectively and comprehensively utilized the seeds, skins, shells, leaves, stems, roots of domestic and wild plants, as well as the meat, skins, fur, bones, horns, blood, internal organs, and glands of domestic and wild animals. Some communes have achieved the transformation of one use into multiple uses, small uses into large uses, and even turned poisonous weeds into very useful things, thereby increasing the economic value of agricultural and sideline products and increasing social wealth. The Lindian County People's Commune in Heilongjiang Province used the poisonous weed wolfsbane, which was always considered useless, to produce alcohol, pesticides, and fertilizers, and used wormwood, which was previously considered not very useful, to produce aromatic oil and pulp. Commune members happily said: Wormwood has always been burned as firewood, but in the 1960s it became a treasure. Orange leaves, which have never been used before, are now also becoming useful things. The Chengjiang People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, a famous orange-producing area, extracts aromatic oil with considerable value from fallen leaves on the ground, and the remaining residue can be used as fertilizer, pesticide, and fuel. The Nan Cun Commune in Fanshun County, Guangdong Province, uses locally produced sweet potatoes to make starch, extract glucose, and then uses the remaining residue to make sauces, brew wine, and finally use it as feed. Sweet potatoes, which were originally only worth two yuan per hundred catties, have increased their output value dozens of times after processing and comprehensive utilization.

The processing and utilization of wild plants is also receiving more and more attention from commune industries in various places. People's communes in Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other areas with more wild plants have seized the word "wild" to make a big deal. Hunan Province alone mobilized the masses to collect 8 million dan of wild plants last year. They used these wild plants to process 700,000 dan of local paper, 1 million dan of pulp, 50,000 sacks, 300,000 dan of ropes, 37 million catties of wine, 17,000 dan of tannin, and more than 80,000 dan of oils and fats. The Jianhe County People's Commune in Guizhou Province launched a mass movement of ten thousand factories, and established more than 15,000 processing plants throughout the county, using more than 700 million catties of wild plants, with a total output value of more than 30 million yuan, equivalent to one and a half times the local grain output value.

Due to the development of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and the strengthening of the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, the commune economy has been strengthened, public accumulation has increased, and the living standards of commune members have also been further improved. Many farmers call the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products the "second harvest." In the past, some mountain farmers complained that the mountains were poor, saying: The mountains are difficult, the mountains are difficult, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are inconvenient, a basket of persimmons costs a dime, ten catties of black dates cost a catty of salt, thousands of trees, ten thousand mu of fields, it is better to go down the mountain to the plains. Since the communization and the vigorous development of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, the masses' reactions have changed. They said that in the past they hated the mountains and wanted to go down the mountain, but now they love the mountains and treasure the mountains. In many places, after the people's communes have run the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, the supply of some daily necessities has become more adequate than in the past, and the broad masses of commune members enthusiastically sing: "Grain is processed, sewing and shoe making are everywhere, oil, wine, sauce and vinegar are all excellent, life is getting better and better, and the future is getting brighter and brighter." In Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, four relatively poor people's communes also quickly caught up with the rich communes because of the vigorous development of the processing industry, and 91 poor teams also caught up with the rich teams because of this. Commune members sang: Thanks to the Party's good ideas, the machine makes ten thousand taels of gold with one sound.

    公社工业综合利用农副产品
    许多“废物”和野生资源变成工业原料  大批公社获得“第二次丰收”
    常年加工和季节突击相结合  集中管理和分散加工相结合  固定加工和流动加工相结合  土法生产和洋法生产相结合
    新华社15日讯　全国各地农村公社工业大搞农副产品加工和综合利用，为轻工业提供了大量原料，节约了大量运输力，并且改善了社员生活。
    我国农村副产品和各种野生资源极其丰富。今年以来，许多人民公社为了充分利用农业资源，有效地扩大轻工业原料来源，专门成立了农副产品和野生资源的加工和综合利用办公室或小组。这些公社抓住了农副产品季节性强，地区分散，产品不易长期保管、不宜长途运输等特点，采取常年加工和季节突击相结合，集中管理和分散加工相结合，固定加工和流动加工相结合，土法和洋法相结合等多种多样办法，因地制宜地组成了星罗棋布的加工网。个别地区开始出现了比较完整的“一条龙”式的加工体系。如河北磁县成安油棉厂建成了轧花、剥绒、榨油以及精炼、制肥皂、制酒等各个加工环节紧密结合的一套完整的加工体系。大大发挥了设备潜力。全厂产值和劳动生产率迅速增长了60％以上，还节约了大量人力物力。黑龙江省林甸县人民公社建立了纸浆、酒精、栲胶、野生纤维、?醛、芳香油、土碱等各种类型的加工厂一千多个，初步形成了十条加工网（龙），两个月内就为轻工业和化学工业提供钾盐、土碱等化工原料五百七十吨，为造纸工业提供了纸浆、纸板三千担。这种加工业一条龙的经验，已经被证明是多快好省地大搞加工业和加强综合利用的好办法，极受有关部门的重视，并且正在向全国推广。
    开展农副产品加工和综合利用的好处极多。凡是已经开展起来的人民公社，就能使季节性很强的农副产品得到及时加工，为大工业提供更多的原料；同时因为是就地加工，也能节省大量运输力和包装器材。浙江省社办工业利用苦竹、玉米秸、桔叶等加工成六万多吨纸浆，二千多吨芳香油，供应上海等城市。上海近郊人民公社建立了大批小纸浆厂，把稻草加工成纸浆，再运到上海作造纸原料。河北省束鹿县人民公社为了给麻纺织工业提供原料，组织社员在几天之内就把七十八万亩棉田所产的棉秆皮全部剥光。开展加工业，不仅对工业生产有很大好处，初步加工后所剩下的残渣等副产品，还能用来作猪饲料和肥料，提制农药，加速农业生产和畜牧业的发展。目前几乎所有的食品加工厂都在生产猪饲料。许多加工厂在用芝麻秸、棉花壳、豆秸、玉米芯以及许多家生和野生植物生产油脂和化工原料的同时，就利用残渣和废液作猪饲料和肥料，或提制农药。
    各地公社工业开展农副产品的加工和综合利用以后，都在不同程度上扩大了资源的利用范围。有些地方人民公社把家生和野生植物的籽、皮、壳、叶、茎、根，以及家生和野生动物的肉、皮、毛、骨、角、血、内脏、腺体，都加以有效地综合利用。有些公社做到了变一用为多用，变小用为大用，甚至把毒草也变成很有用的东西，因而提高了农副产品的经济价值，也增加了社会财富。黑龙江省林甸县人民公社利用一向认为根本没有用的毒草——狼毒，制出酒精、农药和肥料，又利用过去认为用处不大的艾蒿制造芳香油、纸浆。社员高兴地说：艾蒿从来当柴烧，六十年代变成宝。过去从来没有利用过的桔叶，现在也变成有用的东西。著名的黄岩桔产地——浙江省黄岩县澄江人民公社，利用地下落叶提炼出价值相当高的芳香油，剩下的渣子还能作肥料、农药和燃料。广东省番顺县南村公社，农副产品综合加工厂用当地盛产的番茨制淀粉，提炼葡萄糖，又用剩下的渣滓制酱料、酿酒，最后还能作饲料。原来只值二元一百斤的番茨，经过加工和综合利用，产值提高了几十倍。
    野生植物的加工利用也越来越受到各地公社工业的重视。湖南、贵州、四川等野生植物较多地区的人民公社都抓住了“野”字大做文章。仅湖南省去年就发动群众采集了八百万担野生植物。他们利用这些野生植物加工出土纸七十万担、纸浆一百万担、麻袋五万条、绳索三十万担、酒三千七百万斤、栲胶一点七万担、油脂八万多担。贵州省剑河县人民公社掀起群众性的万厂运动，全县办起了一万五千多个加工厂，利用野生植物七亿多斤，产品总值三千多万元，相当于当地粮食产值的一倍半。
    由于农副产品加工业的发展和加强了农副产品的综合利用，更加壮大了公社经济，增加了公共积累，社员生活水平也因之更加得到提高。许多农民把农副产品加工和综合利用叫做“第二次丰收”。过去有些山区农民埋怨山里穷说：山区难来山区难，衣食住行不方便，一筐柿子一毛钱，十斤黑枣一斤盐，千棵树，万亩田，不如下山到平原。自从公社化并且大搞农副产品加工业以后，群众反映变了。他们说过去恨山想下山，现在想山爱宝山。许多地方人民公社举办了农副产品的加工业后，一些生活日用品的供应比过去更加充分，广大社员热情地歌颂道：“粮谷搞加工，缝纫制鞋处处有，油酒酱醋样样精，日子越过越有劲，前途越想越光明。”四川省奉节县还有四个比较穷的人民公社因为大搞加工业，很快就赶上了富社，九十一个穷队也因此赶上了富队。社员歌颂道：感谢党的好主张，机器一响金万两。
