Comrades Chairman and fellow representatives:
I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft state final accounts and state budget, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Our railway workers in Beijing, like workers in other fields, are engaged in a vigorous technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. This movement has now reached a climax, and great achievements have been made in just over a month. Now, I will briefly report on three issues: mechanization of loading and unloading, transforming "native humps" into "foreign humps," and the transformation of locomotives.

I. Mechanization of Loading and Unloading. Our railway transportation is modern transportation, but in the past, the methods of loading and unloading were still very backward, and the level of mechanization was very low, mainly relying on heavy manual labor. The loading and unloading time was long, and efficiency was low. Loading and unloading work at Beijing stations alone occupied more than 7,000 laborers. This backward loading and unloading method is clearly incompatible with modern transportation tools, especially with the current heavy transportation tasks. Workers say this is "running in the middle, stuck at both ends." If the dwell time for loading and unloading operations within the scope of the Beijing Railway Bureau is generally reduced by half, it is equivalent to adding 100 railcars. What great potential would be unlocked if mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading were realized, doubling loading and unloading efficiency and halving the number of personnel! Under the leadership of the Beijing Railway Bureau, we launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading at the beginning of this year. Our method is to carry out concentrated efforts in stages. Since the beginning of February, a city-wide upsurge in large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading has been launched, organizing more than 400 units and more than 50,000 people for large-scale collaboration. After more than 20 days of combat, 257 kinds of indigenous and foreign machines and 4,970 pieces were manufactured, making the seven major freight stations around Beijing, such as Guang'anmen and the Eastern Suburbs, basically realize mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading. The degree of mechanization jumped from the original 12.1% to more than 70%. For example, in the past, unloading a train of coal required 200 people and about 40 minutes; now, we have transformed the vehicles, using wind power to automatically open the car doors, and only one person is needed to move the operating handle, and a train of coal can be completely unloaded in a few minutes. At Guang'anmen Station, in the past, unloading large goods weighing more than 10 tons required more than 30 people and more than 3 hours; now, using electric cranes, it only takes 6 people and a few minutes to unload them, increasing efficiency by nearly 20 times. Workers sang enthusiastically: "Shoulders pressed for decades, waist aches and legs are sore, the Party leads us, vigorously carry out mechanization, throw away sticks and shovels, happiness for ten thousand years." On this basis, as a result of our continued efforts in March, mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading has also been achieved in many medium and small stations. This movement is currently developing in depth, and it is expected that before the "May Day" holiday this year, the slogan of "doubling efficiency and halving personnel" put forward by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee can be realized in loading and unloading operations.

II. "Native Humps" Transformed into "Foreign Humps." Beijing Railway's Fengtai Station is a hub connecting the four major trunk lines of Jing-Shan, Jing-Guang, Jing-Bao, and Jing-Cheng. The shunting routes here are dotted like stars, as dense as spider webs. Every day, thousands of vehicles shuttle back and forth, and these vehicles must undergo operations such as disintegration and marshalling at Fengtai Station before being transferred to all parts of the country. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid increase in transportation volume, Fengtai Station's shunting capacity has not kept up with the growth in transportation volume, which is very tense. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, workers emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and Fengtai Station first created China's first "native hump," changing the past planar shunting method to using slopes for shunting, which increased the station's train reclassification capacity by 65%. However, this year the transportation volume has increased greatly again, and the equipment is still insufficient. In order to ensure the needs of rapid growth in transportation volume and to be the pioneer in the leap forward, while vigorously carrying out mechanization of loading and unloading in February this year, railway workers in the Fengtai area, in conjunction with scientific research institutions, also resolved to transform the "native hump" into a "foreign hump" with a spirit of continuous revolution. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers painstakingly researched and installed new technological equipment with mechanization, electrification, and automation on the basis of the original "native hump." In the past, on the "native hump" shunting yard, when the locomotive pushed dozens of railcars, using the slope from the high earth slope (hump) to slide the railcars to each track, in addition to the signal machine, vehicle braking, switch movement, etc., all had to be operated manually, and the manual labor of switchmen, shuntingmen, and brakemen was very heavy. Now, after this series of reforms, the switchman only needs to sit in the operating building and lightly press the button according to the instructions on the track lighting panel, and the switches on the line will automatically move. The duty officer on the line can fully and correctly grasp the on-site operation status, dynamics, and parking position of locomotives and vehicles through the fluorescent screen on the television. Old workers enthusiastically sang: "Railway transportation develops greatly, electric switches are pressed by buttons, watch comprehensively in the central building, switches no longer need to be moved by hand." The transformation of "native hump" into "foreign hump" is the product of large-scale collaboration. In this movement, more than 2,000 workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, students, and street residents from more than 40 units participated, and the Railway Science Research Institute and the Railway Institute also provided great support and technical assistance. In the movement, the masses of workers have consistently implemented the policy of self-reliance as the mainstay and striving for foreign aid as a supplement, working hard, diligently, and cleverly. Lacking materials, they improvised, economized in every possible way, looked for substitute materials, and collected all available waste materials. They adopted the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians, overcame technical difficulties, and solved many technical problems. In this way, they finally broke through numerous difficulties and completed the innovation project of "foreignizing" the "native hump" in just 17 days. This major reform, coupled with the transformation of the departure and receiving lines and lead lines, can also increase shunting efficiency by 62%, and labor productivity increased by 70%. The transformation of the "native hump" into a "foreign hump" requires less money, is faster, and more efficient. It not only basically meets the needs of the growth in transportation volume for shunting operations at the Fengtai hub station, greatly improves the labor conditions of the workers, but is also a significant innovation in railway transportation work. This proves that "native" can become "foreign," and the power of combining native and foreign methods is infinite. "Foreign" comes from "native," and the future of our technical revolution and technical innovation is infinitely bright.

III. Now I will talk about the technical transformation of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, which has been waving the red flag for 14 years and has driven safely for more than 1.1 million kilometers. In the city-wide technical innovation movement, the locomotive, as the driving force of railway transportation, should rapidly move towards a high standard of modernization and automation. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot played a leading role in this major reform.

Under the leadership and support of the Party, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew engaged in communist collaboration with factories and schools. Starting in mid-February, they vigorously carried out a technical revolution and fought for 20 days, carrying out more than 100 modern technical transformations on the locomotive, of which 24 were automated. After the technical transformation, the air intake and exhaust ports were enlarged, a boiler water heater was installed, and the smoke chamber, chimney, and some parts were adjusted, so that the coal could be fully burned and the steam could be fully utilized, increasing the boiler's evaporation volume and increasing the locomotive's traction capacity by 37%. On March 8, they pulled a freight train from Fengtai to Nancang Station in Tianjin, pulling 4,150 tons, and the technical speed per hour reached 64 kilometers.

In this technical transformation, some automatic lines and assembly lines also appeared. The locomotive's coaling and ash removal were completely replaced by semi-automation and mechanization instead of heavy manual labor. The locomotive's water filling, water measurement, soft water agent injection, and water tank cover opening and closing also formed a semi-automatic assembly line. A locomotive has more than 900 points that need to be lubricated regularly. In the past, all were done manually, and some could only be oiled when the locomotive was stopped; after installing automatic oilers on the main parts, it is not necessary to stop the locomotive and oil can be supplied automatically.

Because the locomotive is equipped with in-cab signals and automatic stopping devices, the driver can now see the traffic signals while sitting in the seat. Even if the driver does not pay attention to the displayed stop signal, the train will sound an alarm to the driver when it reaches a certain distance, and can automatically stop, which ensures absolute safety of traffic. What does this series of technical transformations of the locomotive prove? It proves that technical innovation and technical revolution are endless. Not only can "native" become "foreign," but even very "foreign" modern locomotives can be improved, improved, and improved again through technical innovation.

Under the leadership of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, the entire Fengtai Locomotive Depot is currently heading towards a climax of technical innovation and transformation of locomotives.

The brilliant achievements made by the workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau in carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are the victory of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the victory of putting politics in command, the victory of carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible and all-conquering ideological weapon for the working class to carry out revolution and construction. Which unit's workers learn the theory, which unit's production will be better. The nine theoretical study groups in our Fengtai Locomotive Depot that have better theoretical studies are all advanced collectives of the depot, bureau, city, or country. The workers of the brake group conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," and their work continued to leap forward, becoming a red banner for the double leap forward in ideology and production. After studying the viewpoint of the primacy of matter and the secondary nature of consciousness, they had a further understanding of the dialectical relationship between the subjective and objective, applied it to their work, understood starting from reality, grasping objective laws, and realized the great role of giving play to subjective initiative in transforming the world. In this way, they greatly boosted their energy and promoted them to constantly create miracles in production. For example, the locomotive's water consumption reached 664 kilograms per hour at the beginning of 1959, and much water vapor was wasted unnecessarily. How to reduce water consumption became the main key to saving coal. Regarding this issue, some people at that time believed that it was impossible to improve due to the low quality of accessories and poor equipment conditions. However, after studying the principle of giving play to subjective initiative, the comrades' understanding changed. After actively holding meetings for research by various repair groups, they found that the main reasons for the large water consumption were imprecise processing and insufficient subjective effort. They painstakingly studied, improved their tools, and performed meticulous inspection and repair, resulting in the compression of water consumption to 54.5 kilograms per hour. Studying dialectics, overcoming one-sidedness in ideological methods, further understanding the dialectical relationship between more, faster, better, and more economical, deepened the understanding of the general line, and laid the ideological foundation for a comprehensive leap forward. This proves how important theoretical study is for guiding our actions. In our study, we emphasized linking with reality, criticized the one-sided views that "more pulling and faster running cannot be safe and save coal" and "to be safe and save coal, one cannot pull more and run faster," and recognized the dialectical relationship of unity of opposites between them, ensuring a comprehensive leap forward in efficiency, safety, quality, and cost. Some workers used to be depressed whenever accidents occurred, but after understanding the principle that bad things can be turned into good things, when they encountered accidents again, they took a positive attitude, found the reasons, learned from the lessons, and took measures, which further enhanced their confidence and determination to eliminate accidents and prevented more similar accidents from happening. Using Mao Zedong Thought theory to guide practice among workers fully proves the irrefutable truth that Marx said: "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes a material force," and also proves that organizing workers to study theory is an extremely important method for conducting political and ideological education and promoting production leaps forward.

At present, a high tide of learning culture, learning technology, learning theory, and studying Mao Zedong's works is being set off among all the workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau. More than 90% of the workers regularly participate in cultural learning and technical learning. There are more than 1,500 groups participating in theoretical studies, with 38,000 workers, accounting for about 80% of the total number of workers. In this upsurge of theoretical study, 362 worker lecturers and 438 instructors have emerged, and 2,363 articles have been written. Comrade Zhang Yongfa, a fitter, has given a report on "Breaking Superstitions and Learning Theory" at the Petroleum Institute and the cadre training class of the Underground Railway Engineering Bureau, which was welcomed by the audience.

Countless facts have made us deeply realize that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emancipate our minds, break superstitions, and continuously make revolution, we can effectively promote the large-scale development of the technical revolution, and the technical revolution movement can effectively promote the great leap forward in transportation production. In order to complete the ever-increasing transportation tasks, shoulder the glorious responsibility of "pioneer officer," and find every possible means to tap transportation potential and rapidly change the weak link of railway transportation, all the workers of our entire office are continuing to study Mao Zedong's works in depth, and arming all cadres and workers with Mao Zedong Thought. While learning culture and technology and on the basis of ideological leap forward, a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution movement will be launched, further eliminating heavy manual labor, improving the level of loading and unloading mechanization and continuity, and carrying out large-scale collaboration of production, supply, transportation, and sales, so that the revolution in technical equipment and the revolution in transportation organization are mutually combined and mutually promoted, in order to ensure the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and basic construction, and set off a high-volume transportation movement.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are confidently moving from victory to a greater victory!

    高举毛泽东思想的红旗　大闹技术革命　保证运输生产大跃进
    郭树德代表谈北京市铁路职工技术革命动向主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于国家决算和国家预算草案的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我们北京市的铁路职工和其他方面的职工一样正在开展一个如火如荼的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革命运动，这个运动现在已经形成高潮，仅在一个多月的时间内，就已经取得了很大的成绩。现在，我仅就装卸机械化、改造“土驼峰”成为“洋驼峰”和改造机车等三个问题作一个简要汇报。
    一、装卸机械化。我们的铁路运输是现代化的运输，但是在过去装卸的方式还很落后，机械化的水平很低，主要依靠笨重的体力劳动，装卸的时间长、效率低，北京各站装卸工作就占用了七千多个劳动力，这种落后的装卸方式和现代化运输工具，特别与目前繁重的运输任务显然是不相适应的，工人说这是“跑在中间、窝在两头”。从北京铁路办事处的范围内如果把装卸作业停留时间普遍的压缩一半，就等于增加一百辆车皮。如果实现了装卸机械化、半机械化，装卸效率翻一番，人员减少一半，这是多么大的潜力啊！我们在北京铁路局的领导下，今年年初开展了一个以装卸机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新、技术革命的群众性运动。我们采取的办法是分阶段进行突击。自2月初开始掀起了一个全民性的大搞装卸机械化、半机械化的高潮，组织了四百多个单位、五万多人，进行了大协作。经过二十多天的战斗，制造出各种土洋机具二百五十七种，四千九百七十件，使北京城周围的广安门、东郊等七个主要货运站基本实现了装卸机械化、半机械化。使机械化的程度由原来的12.1％一跃而为70％以上。例如过去卸一列车煤需要二百人、四十分钟左右的时间；现在我们改造了车辆，利用风力自动开关车门，只要一个人，搬一下操作柄，在几分钟的时间内就可以把一列车的煤全部卸完。在广安门车站，过去卸十吨以上的大件货物，需要三十多人、卸三个多小时的时间；现在使用电动吊车，只用六个人、几分钟就卸下来，提高了效率将近二十倍。工人歌颂说：这是“肩压几十年，腰疼腿又酸，党来领导咱，大搞机械化，抛掉棍和锹，幸福万万年。”在这个基础上，我们在3月份继续努力的结果，在许多中、小车站也实现了装卸机械化和半机械化。这一运动目前正向纵深发展，预计今年“五一”节以前在装卸作业上，就能实现中共北京市委和市人民委员会提出的“效率翻一番、人员减一半”的号召。
    二、“土驼峰”变“洋驼峰”。北京铁路丰台车站是联接京山、京广、京包、京承四大干线的枢纽，这里的调车路线星罗棋布，密如蛛网，这里每天有成千上万的车辆穿梭般地往来，这些车辆要在丰台站经过解体、编组等作业然后再转送到全国各地。大跃进以来，随着运输量的急剧增长，丰台站的调车能力跟不上运输量的增长，显得非常紧张。1958年大跃进中，工人们解放思想、破除迷信，丰台站首先创造了我国第一个“土驼峰”，把过去的平面的调车方法改变为利用坡度来调车，使车站的列车改编能力提高了65％。但是今年运量又有很大增长，设备仍感不足，为了保证运量迅速增长的需要，做好跃进中的先行官，在今年2月大搞装卸机械化的同时，丰台地区铁路职工与科学研究机关结合，又以不断革命的精神决心要把“土驼峰”变成“洋驼峰”。在党委的领导下，职工们苦心钻研，在原有“土驼峰”的基础上，安装了机械化、电气化、自动化的新的技术装备。过去，在“土驼峰”调车场上，当机车顶着几十节车皮，从高起的土坡（驼峰）上利用坡度，使车皮分别滑到各条股道上去的时候，除了信号机以外，车辆制动、道岔搬动等等都要用手工操作，搬道员、调车员和制动员的体力劳动十分繁重；现在，经过这一系列的改革之后，搬道员只要坐在操作楼内，根据轨道照明盘的指示，轻便地按动电钮，线路上的道岔就会自动地移动。搬道员再也不用跟着车辆跑来跑去去搬道岔，线路上的值班员只要通过电视机上的萤光屏，就能全面正确地掌握现场机车车辆运行状况、动态和停车位置等等情况。老工人热情地歌颂说：“铁路运输大发展，电气道岔电钮按，集中楼上看全面，道岔再不用手搬。”“土驼峰”变“洋驼峰”是大协作的产物，在这个运动中，共有四十多个单位的二千多名职工、解放军官兵、学生和街道居民参加了进来，铁道科学研究院、铁道学院也给了很大的支持和技术上帮助。运动中，职工群众自始至终贯彻了自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的方针，穷干、苦干、巧干，缺乏材料，他们就因陋就简，千方百计地节约、寻找代用材料，搜集了一切可以利用的废旧料。他们采取了领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，攻克了技术关，解决了不少技术上的问题。这样他们终于突破了重重困难，仅用十七天的时间就完成了“土驼峰”洋化的革新工程。这一重大改革，再加到发线和牵出线的改造调车效率还可以提高62％，劳动生产率提高了70％。“土驼峰”变洋，花钱少、速度快、效率高，不仅基本上满足了运量增长对丰台枢纽站调车作业的需要，大大地改善了工人们的劳动条件，而且是铁路运输工作中的一项意义重大的革新创举。这证明了“土”可以变“洋”，土洋并举的威力无穷。土中出洋，我们技术革命和技术革新的前途无限光明。
    三、现在我谈一谈红旗招展十四年，安全行车一百一十多万公里的“毛泽东号”机车的技术改造的情况。在全民性的技术革新运动中，作为铁路运输动力的火车头更应迅速地向高标准的现代化、自动化迈进。丰台机务段“毛泽东号”机车在这一重大改革中起了带头作用。
    在党的领导与支持下，“毛泽东号”机车包乘组与工厂、学校大搞共产主义协作，从2月中旬开始，大闹技术革命，大战二十天，对机车进行了一百多项现代化的技术改造，其中有二十四项实现了自动化。经过技术改造后，加大了进气口与排气口，安装了锅炉给水的加温器，并对烟室、烟筒和一些部件进行了调整，这样就使煤能充分燃烧、蒸汽能充分利用，增大了锅炉的蒸发量，使机车的牵引能力提高37％，他们在3月8日由丰台到天津南仓站牵引一列货车，拉了四千一百五十吨，每小时的技术速度达到六十四公里。
  在这次技术改造中，还出现了一些自动线和流水线。机车从上煤到清炉完全用半自动化和机械化代替了人的笨重体力劳动。机车上水、量水、投软水剂、开关水柜盖也组成了一条半自动流水线。一台机车有九百多处要经常注油润滑。以前都用手工操作，有的只能在停车时才能给油；在主要部件上安装了自动给油器后，可以不必停车自动给油。
    由于机车上装上了车内信号与自动停车装置，现在司机坐在座椅上，就可以看到行车信号。即使司机没有注意显示的停车信号，列车到达一定距离时，也会向司机发出警报，并能自动停下，这就保证了行车的绝对安全。机车的这一系列的技术改造证明什么呢？证明技术革新和技术革命是无止境的，不但土的可以变洋，而且已经是很洋的现代化的机车，还可以通过技术革新，提高，提高，再提高。
    在“毛泽东号”机车包乘组的带动下，目前丰台机务段全段正奔向革新技术改造机车的高潮。
    我们北京铁路办事处职工在开展技术革新和技术革命运动中所取得的辉煌成就，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利，是政治挂帅的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    毛泽东思想是工人阶级进行革命和建设的战无不胜、攻无不克的思想武器，哪个单位工人学习了理论，哪个单位生产就搞得更好。我们丰台机务段九个理论学习较好的小组都是段、局、市或全国的先进集体。制动组工人认真学习毛主席的“矛盾论”、“实践论”，他们的工作不断跃进，成为思想、生产双跃进的一面红旗。他们学习了物质第一性、意识第二性的观点之后，对主客观的辩证关系有了进一步理解，运用到工作中，懂得了从实际出发，掌握客观规律，认识到发挥主观能动性对改造世界的重大作用。这样就大鼓干劲，推动他们在生产上不断地创造奇迹。如机车耗水量1959年初达到一小时六百六十四公斤，许多水蒸汽无谓地被消耗掉了，如何降低耗水量就成为节煤中的主要关键。对这个问题，当时有些人认为是由于配件质量低、设备条件不好，无法改进。但在学习了发挥主观能动性的道理以后，这些同志的认识转变了，经过各个包修组积极开会研究，找出了加工不细、主观努力不够是耗水量大的主要原因，他们苦心钻研，改进了工具，作到了细检细修，结果将耗水量压缩到一小时五十四点五公斤。学习了辩证法，克服了思想方法上的片面性，进一步认识了多快好省的辩证关系，加深了对总路线的理解，打下了全面跃进的思想基础。证明了学习理论对于指导我们行动有多么重要的意义。学习中我们强调联系实际，批判了“多拉快跑就不能安全、节煤”、“要安全节煤就不能多拉快跑”的片面观点，认识到它们之间对立统一的辩证关系，保证了效率、安全、质量、成本全面跃进。有的职工，过去每当发生事故时就情绪低沉，但当懂得了坏事可以变为好事的道理之后，再遇到发生事故时，就以积极的态度，找原因、吸取教训、采取措施，结果就进一步增强了消灭事故的信心和决心，更多地防止了类似事故的发生。在工人中用毛泽东思想的理论指导实践，充分证明了马克思所说的：“理论一旦掌握群众，便变成物质力量”这一颠扑不破的真理，也证明了组织工人学习理论是进行政治思想教育、促进生产跃进的一个极为重要的方法。
    目前，北京铁路办事处全体职工中正在掀起一个学文化、学技术和学理论、学习毛泽东著作的高潮。经常参加文化学习和技术学习的职工都在90％以上。参加理论学习的共有一千五百多个小组，职工达三万八千人，约占职工总数的80％左右。在这个学习理论的高潮中，涌现出工人讲师三百六十二人，辅导员四百三十八人，写出了二千三百六十三篇文章。钳工张永发同志曾到石油学院、地下铁道工程局干部训练班作过“破除迷信学理论”的报告，受到听众欢迎。
    无数的事实，使我们深深体会到只要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，解放思想，破除迷信，不断革命，就能够有力地促进技术革命大开展，而技术革命运动又有力地促进了运输生产大跃进。为了完成日益增长的运输任务，担负起“先行官”的光荣职责，千方百计挖掘运输潜力，迅速改变铁路运输这一薄弱环节，我们全办事处职工正在继续深入学习毛泽东著作，以毛泽东思想武装全体干部和职工。在学文化学技术的同时和思想跃进的基础上，掀起技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮，进一步消除笨重体力劳动，提高装卸机械化和连续化的水平，大搞产、供、运、销一条龙大协作，使技术装备上的革命和运输组织上的革命互相结合、互相促进，为保证工农业生产和基本建设的跃进，掀起一个高运量运动。
    在党中央和毛主席英明领导下，我们充满信心地正从胜利走向更伟大的胜利！
