Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 11th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party stated in a statement issued on the 10th that in deciding on a unified understanding and unified steps to deal with the common enemy—imperialism, the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference should reach this conclusion: U.S. imperialism is the most dangerous enemy in the current struggle of the Asian-African people for national independence.

The statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party to welcome the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference also said that imperialism will play the old tune of the "communist threat" in an attempt to divert the attention of the conference from the main issues.

The statement pointed out that the period between the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference (held in Cairo from December 26, 1957 to January 1, 1958) and the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is characterized by the increasingly powerful and successful struggles of the Asian-African people. Inspired by the resolutions adopted at the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, and driven by the spirit of solidarity, the Asian-African people have strengthened their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and have successfully dealt heavy blows to imperialism.

The statement said that another characteristic of this period is that imperialism has intensified its conspiracy to divide the solidarity of Asian-African countries. Since imperialism has failed to frighten the Asian-African people with terrifying things such as the "communist threat," imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, has begun to adopt a policy of sowing discord among the Asian-African people, instigating and spreading national chauvinism, and its main attempt is to isolate the People's Republic of China—one of the countries that has made the most important contributions to Asian-African solidarity.

The statement added that the barbaric killings in South Africa show that the struggle against racial discrimination and national chauvinism cannot be separated from the struggle to completely eliminate imperialism and colonialism from Asian-African soil. The statement advocated that the Conakry Conference pay attention to and solve the problem of demanding that imperialists and colonialists get out of Asia and Africa. The statement hoped that the conference would formulate a plan for the Asian-African people to completely eliminate colonialism and imperialism from Asian-African soil.

The statement went on to say that as long as the economies of Asian-African countries have a colonial nature and are controlled by imperialism, they cannot achieve complete national independence. The statement hoped that the representatives attending the Conakry Conference would formulate specific plans to help many Asian-African countries transform their respective economic systems—which are still essentially colonial or semi-colonial economic systems—into national economic systems, and enable them to get rid of the economic control and influence of imperialist countries. The statement said that old-fashioned colonialism, which has been discredited on Asian-African soil, has given way to a new type of colonialism—the colonialism of U.S. imperialism. It is U.S. imperialism that supports France in continuing to use force to suppress the Algerian people's struggle; it is also U.S. imperialism that attempts to prevent popular movements by establishing military bases in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Congo, and Liberia in Africa, and in Turkey, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan in Asia; it is also U.S. imperialism that creates chaos in Laos and South Vietnam, and tries its best to help the Netherlands occupy West Irian, the legitimate territory of the Republic of Indonesia, thereby threatening peace and security.

The statement said that only by fully guaranteeing the democratic rights of the Asian-African people can they effectively carry out the struggle against imperialism. U.S. imperialism knows this, so it instigates some Asian countries to establish military dictatorships, personal dictatorships, and the like, in order to eliminate or reduce the democratic rights of the people. The statement pointed out that the struggle to abolish military treaties, defend democratic rights, and oppose military dictatorships is inseparable from the struggle to completely eliminate imperialism and colonialism from Asian-African soil.

The statement finally called on all Indonesian people to fully support the Conakry Conference.

### 印度尼西亚共产党发表声明指出  美帝国主义是亚非人民最危险的敌人  只有充分保证亚非人民的民主权利才能有效地进行反帝斗争

    印度尼西亚共产党发表声明指出
    美帝国主义是亚非人民最危险的敌人
    只有充分保证亚非人民的民主权利才能有效地进行反帝斗争
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在10日发表的一项声明中指出，在决定对付共同的敌人——帝国主义的一致看法和统一步骤时，第二届亚非人民团结大会应当得出这个结论：美帝国主义是当前亚非人民争取民族独立的斗争中的最危险的敌人。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局为欢迎第二届亚非人民团结大会的召开而发表的声明还说，帝国主义会弹起“共产主义威胁”的老调，企图使大会的注意力从主要问题上转移到别处去。
    声明指出，在第一届亚非人民团结大会（1957年12月26日到1958年1月1日在开罗举行）和第二届亚非人民团结大会之间的时期的特点是，亚非人民进行的斗争愈来愈有力和成功。在万隆会议和开罗会议所通过的决议的鼓舞下和在团结精神的推动下，亚非人民已经加强了他们对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，并且成功地给予帝国主义沉重的打击。
    声明说，这一个时期的另一个特点是，帝国主义加紧策划分裂亚非国家团结的阴谋。由于帝国主义没有能够用“共产主义威胁”之类的吓人玩意吓倒亚非人民，帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义，开始采取在亚非人民之间散布不和的政策，煽动和散布民族沙文主义，其主要企图是想孤立中华人民共和国——对亚非团结作出了最重要的贡献的国家之一。
    声明又说，南非的野蛮的枪杀事件表明，反对种族歧视和民族沙文主义，同彻底消除亚非土地上的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是不能够分开的。声明主张科纳克里会议注意和解决要帝国主义和殖民主义者滚出亚洲和非洲的问题。声明希望大会制订关于亚非人民彻底消除亚非土地上的殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争计划。
    声明接着说，只要亚非国家各自的经济具有殖民地性质，而且受到帝国主义的控制，那么，它们就不能获得完全的民族独立。声明希望参加科纳克里会议的代表们拟订具体的计划来帮助许多亚非国家，把它们各自的经济制度——基本上仍然是殖民地或半殖民地的经济制度——变成民族的经济制度，并且使它们能够摆脱帝国主义国家经济的控制和影响。声明说，在亚非土地上已经搞臭的老牌殖民主义已经让位给新型的殖民主义——美帝国主义的殖民主义。支持法国继续用武力来镇压阿尔及利亚人民斗争的是美帝国主义；企图通过在非洲的摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚、刚果和利比里亚以及在亚洲的土耳其、台湾、南朝鲜、泰国和日本的军事基地来阻止人民运动的也是美帝国主义；在老挝和南越制造混乱局势，竭力帮助荷兰占据印度尼西亚共和国的合法领土西伊里安，从而威胁和平与安全的，也是美帝国主义。
    声明说，只有充分保证亚非人民的民主权利，他们才能有效地进行反对帝国主义的斗争。美帝国主义知道这一点，所以它煽动若干亚洲国家建立军事独裁、个人独裁之类的东西，以便消除或减少人民的民主权利。声明指出，取消军事条约、保卫民主权利和反对军事独裁的斗争，同彻底消除亚非土地上的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是分不开的。
    声明最后要求全体印度尼西亚人民充分支持科纳克里会议。
