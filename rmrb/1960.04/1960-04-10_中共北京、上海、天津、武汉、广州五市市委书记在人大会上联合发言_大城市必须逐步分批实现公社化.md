Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The question of establishing people's communes in large cities aroused widespread interest at today's session of the National People's Congress. Representatives from large cities pointed out that large cities must gradually realize the people's commune system in batches. It is necessary to actively develop, but also implement the principle of voluntarism, and never demand that everyone participate together.

Representatives held group discussions this morning and a general meeting this afternoon. Lu Dingyi, Xie Juezai, He Xiangning, Cheng Qian, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Fu Zuoyi and other representatives made speeches and written statements at the meeting. Members attending the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also attended the meeting.

Wan Li, Cao Diqiu, Wan Xiaotang, Song Yiping, and Zhu Guang, the Municipal Party Secretaries of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, said in a joint speech that these five cities began experimenting with urban people's communes in 1958. More than a year of practice has proved that the people's commune is also completely suitable for large cities, and it is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people.

They talked about the great superiority of urban people's communes in large cities: the communes in the five major cities have all developed production. During the year of trial operation in 1959, street industrial production units alone created nearly 800 million yuan in output value and processing fees, making it a new force on the industrial front; all communes have developed collective living and welfare undertakings, and increased the income of the working people. Last year, the monthly wages of commune members increased from a dozen yuan at the beginning to twenty or thirty yuan by the end of the year, and some even more; the establishment of urban people's communes has also further strengthened cooperation between various departments and promoted the development of cultural, educational and health undertakings.

Representatives such as Wan Li said that the facts prove that urban people's communes can not only promote the high-speed development of production, but also are an important tool for thoroughly transforming old cities to make them suitable for the current stage of socialist construction and the future communist ideal.

When talking about the future practices of people's communes in large cities, representatives such as Wan Li said that due to the differences in ideological awareness, income, living standards, and living habits of people from all walks of life in cities, their demands for urban people's communes are also inconsistent. Some people in industry and commerce and intellectuals still have some concerns about joining the commune, and the change of some people's living habits still requires a long process. It also takes a considerable process to make the collective welfare and service organizations for all the people in the city more and more perfect. Therefore, when organizing the production and life of urban people's communes, we should continue to implement the principles of active development, actively running the communes well, and also implementing the principle of voluntarism, and never demand that everyone participate together. For those who do not yet have such demands and needs, and those who still have some concerns, do not force them to participate, and advise them not to force themselves to participate. Especially for public canteens, according to the Party's policy, we have adopted the policy of both actively running them well and based on voluntarism in the countryside, and now we should do the same in cities.

They said that as for personal belongings (including houses, clothing, furniture, etc.) and deposits in banks and credit cooperatives, they still belong to individuals. Public canteens and nurseries should also organize and absorb those who participate in production and are willing to join. Whether participating in the people's commune or not, daily necessities should be supplied as usual.

Representatives such as Wan Li said that these five cities plan to first run people's communes centered on streets well in the future, and at the same time gradually run people's communes centered on factories, mines, institutions, and schools well, and gradually realize the people's commune system in the entire city in batches.

Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, talked about the work of the Supreme People's Court and local Higher People's Courts in carrying out the amnesty of criminals last year. He pointed out that this amnesty fully demonstrated the consolidation and strength of our country and the great success of the Party's policy. Transforming the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty into a self-reliant laborer, transforming war criminals into new people, transforming secret agents and bandits from saboteurs into builders, transforming habitual thieves and pickpockets into people who pick up lost items and do not pocket them, and transforming many negative factors left over from the old society into positive factors for building socialism. This is a major achievement.

Xie Juezai said that all the criminals released under amnesty have now been properly resettled and have begun their new lives. He said that our country has always implemented the Party's policy of combining punishment and leniency in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals; implementing the principle of combining labor reform and ideological education; and at the same time, this work is not only carried out by state organs, but also widely attracts the masses of people across the country to do it. Xie Juezai said that the transformation of criminals is a form of dictatorship and a continuation of class struggle. In the future, on the one hand, we must continue to strengthen the transformation work of criminals who are being reformed, and at the same time, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the sabotage activities of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke about the great victory achieved in the democratic reform in Tibet. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that due to the victory in quelling the rebellion and the democratic reform, the Tibet region has presented an unprecedented prosperous and vibrant new scene, and the Tibetan people have embarked on a new stage of national development and national prosperity.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that except for a few remote areas in Tibet, the democratic reform movement in the entire region will be successfully completed before sowing this year. In the reform, in areas where land distribution has been completed, farmers have received more than 2.1 million "Kret" of land (one "Kret" is equivalent to one "Mu"), with an average of three and a half "Kret" per person; due to the implementation of the policies of "whoever cultivates it harvests it," rent and interest reduction, and the abolition of old debts, the average working people can get more than 1,500 "Jin" of grain per person. Now, mutual aid teams have been organized everywhere, setting off a vigorous patriotic production increase movement, making the Tibet region appear an unprecedented good situation of a leap in production. This year, they have the confidence to increase agricultural production by 15% to 20%, and animal husbandry will also develop greatly.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that in the democratic reform in Tibet, the masses were fully mobilized, and at the same time, a lenient policy was implemented towards the serf owners. The people's democratic united front in Tibet has been further strengthened. The broad masses of people recognized that the Tibetan people are always members of the motherland's big family, and they are determined to always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao on the bright road of socialism and communism. The imperialists and foreign reactionaries are constantly clamoring that the Chinese Communist Party wants to eliminate the nationalities and religions of Tibet. This is nothing more than an attempt to protect Tibet's cruel and dark serf system. Now millions of serfs have stood up, and the sabotage activities of any domestic and foreign reactionaries will never succeed.

He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said in her speech that today's situation and conditions are very favorable for us to realize the continued leap forward this year. Through the joint efforts of the 650 million people across the country, we are not only confident that this year's national economic plan will be completed on schedule, but we will definitely overfulfill it.

He Xiangning said that like other democratic parties, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement in 1957, and after two years of great leap forward, has taken a big step forward in the long journey from a bourgeois political party to a political force that truly serves socialism; The political and ideological outlook of the majority of members has also undergone great changes in the process of actively serving socialism. She said that some of the progress we have made in self-transformation, measured by the requirements of the rapidly developing situation of the motherland, and compared with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people, is still a considerable distance away, and we must continue to carry out the transformation of political stance and ideology without arrogance or impetuosity.

He Xiangning said that at present, our country's socialist cause is developing and deepening day by day. Our RCCK, together with other democratic parties, must correctly understand the great significance of the urban people's commune, enthusiastically support this historically significant initiative, and keep up with the great era.

Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke about the excellent situation in Hunan Province. He said that in the first spring of the 1960s, the production situation in Hunan Province in terms of industrial production, capital construction, and transportation was very good. The movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is developing forward with one wave higher than the other. Production in January and February rose steadily, entering a new stage of sustained leap forward. The province's peasants are full of energy and enthusiasm, and have launched a magnificent and vigorous large-scale production upsurge centered on spring plowing. Agricultural capital construction is proceeding on an unprecedented scale and speed, and a new phenomenon of "man-made seas in the mountains, canals better than the Yangtze River and Huai River, water flowing through the air, and sailboats coming to the ridges" has appeared in many places. Cheng Qian said that from Hunan, looking at the whole country, we have absolute confidence in realizing the 1960 national economic plan and overfulfilling various indicators.

Cheng Qian also talked about the Taiwan issue in his speech. He said that we cannot tolerate American imperialism still occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan, and we absolutely cannot tolerate the American imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" succeeding. The great Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and realize the complete unification of the motherland.

Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, made a speech on further developing water conservancy and electric power. He pointed out that China's water conservancy and electric power industry achieved another continued great leap forward in 1959. In 1959, a large number of large, medium and small-sized reservoir projects were built across the country, with a total of 13 billion cubic meters of earth and stone completed, expanding the irrigation area by 70 million "Mu." These projects played a huge role in defeating last year's floods and droughts and ensuring the continued great leap forward in agricultural production. In terms of the electric power industry, both production and capital construction in 1959 greatly exceeded 1958. The rapid development of the electric power industry has significantly changed the position of China's electric power production level in the world. In 1949, China's power generation ranked 25th in the world, and in 1959 it jumped to ninth. Fu Zuoyi said that since last winter, a greater upsurge of water conservancy construction has been launched across the country. According to recent statistics, the area of irrigation expanded and improved nationwide in this upsurge has already overfulfilled the plan of 260 million "Mu." Together with the projects built in the past, each river basin has a more complete water conservancy system, and the landscape of the great motherland has been renewed because of this. Fu Zuoyi said that in order to guarantee the electricity demand for the continued leap forward of the national economy, China's power generation in 1960 will increase by 34% to 40% compared with 1959, and the installed capacity will increase by 31% compared with 1959. We will definitely be able to successfully realize the continued leap forward this year.

Also speaking at the conference today were: Liu Yaxiong, Shu Xincheng, Qian Duanyou, Zhang Wenjin, Liu Jiuxue, Ma Yuzhen, and Wang Dezi.

The afternoon session of the conference was held after a speech by Comrade Bayanle. Jalkhasaikhan, head of the delegation of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic. Today's executive chairmen of the conference were: Zhu De, Lin Boqu, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, He Xiangning, Liu Bocheng, Lin Feng, Wu Yuzhang, Tan Zheng, Yang Mingxuan, Lin Tie, Li Daizhang, Deng Yingchao, Xu Teli, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Li Jiebo, Wang Guofan, Kui Bi, Qian Xuesen, Mei Lanfang, and Zhou Shutao.

    中共北京、上海、天津、武汉、广州五市市委书记在人大会上联合发言
    大城市必须逐步分批实现公社化
    他们在发言中指出：一年多以来的实践，证明人民公社在大城市也是完全适合的，它为广大人民所热烈欢迎。城市人民公社不仅能促进生产高速度的发展，而且还是彻底改造旧城市使之适合于现阶段的社会主义建设和未来的共产主义理想的重要工具。在组织城市人民公社生产和生活时，应当继续贯彻执行积极发展，积极把公社办好，又要实行自愿原则，决不要要求一切人都一起参加。
    新华社9日讯　在今天的全国人民代表大会会议上，关于在大城市建立人民公社的问题，引起了人们广泛的兴趣。来自大城市的代表指出，大城市必须逐步分批地实现人民公社化。既要积极发展，又要实行自愿原则，决不要要求一切人都一起参加。
    代表们在今天上午分组讨论，下午举行大会。陆定一、谢觉哉、何香凝、程潜、阿沛·阿旺晋美、傅作义等代表，在会上作了发言和书面发言。出席政协第三届第二次会议的委员们也列席了会议。
    北京、上海、天津、武汉、广州五大城市的中共市委书记万里、曹荻秋、万晓塘、宋一平、朱光在联合发言中说，这五个城市从1958年起就开始试办了城市人民公社。一年多以来的实践，证明人民公社在大城市也是完全适合的，它为广大人民所热烈欢迎。
    他们谈到了城市人民公社在大城市所表现出的巨大优越性：五大城市的公社都发展了生产，在1959年一年的试办期间，仅街道工业生产单位就创造了近八亿元的产值和加工费，它成为工业战线上的一支新生的力量；各公社都发展了集体生活福利事业，增加了劳动人民的收入，去年社员的月工资从开始时的十几元，到年底增长到二、三十元，有的还更多些；城市人民公社的建立，还进一步加强了各部门之间的协作，促进了文教卫生事业的发展。
    万里等代表说，事实证明，城市人民公社不仅能促进生产高速度的发展，而且还是彻底改造旧城市使之适合于现阶段的社会主义建设和未来的共产主义理想的重要工具。
    万里等代表谈到大城市人民公社今后的作法时说，由于城市中各阶层人民的思想觉悟、收入、生活水平和生活习惯等有所差别，他们对城市人民公社的要求也不一致，有些工商界人士和知识分子对入社还有些顾虑，同时有些人生活习惯的改变还需要一个较长的过程，而把城市全体人民的集体福利和服务组织办得更多更完善也还需要一个相当的过程，因此在组织城市人民公社生产和生活时，应当继续贯彻执行积极发展，积极把公社办好，又要实行自愿原则，决不要要求一切人都一起参加。对那些现在还没有这种要求和需要的人，还有若干顾虑的人，不要勉强吸收他们参加，并且劝他们不要勉强参加。特别是公共食堂，根据党的方针，我们在乡村就是采取既积极办好又根据自愿的政策，现在在城市更应该如此。
    他们说，至于对个人所有的生活资料（包括房屋、衣被、家具等）和在银行、信用社的存款，仍然都归个人所有。公共食堂、托儿所亦应组织和吸收那些参加生产而又愿意加入的人参加。无论参加人民公社与否，生活必需品都应照常供应。
    万里等代表说，这五个城市今后打算首先办好以街道为中心的人民公社，同时也逐步办好以厂矿、机关、学校为中心的人民公社，逐步分批地实现全市的人民公社化。
    最高人民法院院长谢觉哉在发言中谈到最高人民法院和各地高级人民法院去年执行特赦罪犯工作的情况，他指出，这次特赦，充分显示了我们国家的巩固和强盛，显示了党的政策的伟大成功。把清朝末代的皇帝改造成为自食其力的劳动者，把战犯改造成为新人，把特务土匪从破坏者改造成为建设者，把惯盗惯窃改造成为拾金不昧的人，把许多旧社会遗留下来的消极因素，改造成为建设社会主义的积极因素。这是一个重大的成就。
    谢觉哉谈到，凡是特赦释放的罪犯，现在都得到了妥当安置，开始了他们的新的生活。他说，我们国家在同反革命和其他犯罪分子的斗争中，历来实行了党的惩办与宽大相结合的政策；实行劳动改造和思想教育相结合的原则；同时，这一工作不仅由国家机关进行，而且广泛吸引全国人民群众来做。谢觉哉说，对罪犯的改造，是专政的一种形式，也是阶级斗争的继续。今后一方面要继续对正在改造的罪犯加强改造工作，同时还要对帝国主义和蒋介石集团的破坏活动，保持高度的警惕。 　 西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美在发言中谈到西藏民主改革取得的伟大胜利。阿沛·阿旺晋美说，由于平定叛乱和民主改革的胜利，西藏地区已经呈现出一片从来没有过的欣欣向荣和生气勃勃的新景象，西藏民族已经走上了民族发展和民族繁荣的崭新阶段。 　 阿沛·阿旺晋美说，西藏除了少数边远地区以外，全区的民主改革运动将在今年播种以前胜利完成。在改革中，已经完成土地分配的地区，农民分得二百一十万余克土地（一克地相当于一市亩），每人平均得到三克半；由于实行了“谁种谁收”、减租减息和废除旧债等政策，劳动人民平均每人可得一千五百多斤粮食。现在，各地已经组织了互助组，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的爱国增产运动，使西藏地区出现了从来没有过的生产跃进的大好形势。今年他们有信心在农业生产上增产15％到20％，畜牧业也将大大发展。 　 阿沛·阿旺晋美说，西藏在民主改革中，充分发动了群众，同时对农奴主实行了宽大的政策。西藏的人民民主统一战线更加壮大了。广大人民认定，西藏人民永远是祖国大家庭中的一员，他们决心要永远跟着共产党、毛主席走社会主义和共产主义的光明大道。帝国主义和外国反动派喋喋不休地叫嚷什么中国共产党要消灭西藏的民族和宗教，这无非是妄图保障西藏残酷黑暗的农奴制度。现在百万农奴已经站起来了，任何国内外反动派的破坏活动都是永远不能得逞的。 　 何香凝副委员长在发言中说，今天的形势和条件，对于我们实现今年的继续跃进，是非常有利的。通过全国六亿五千万人的共同努力，我们今年的国民经济计划不仅有把握如期完成，而且一定将超额完成。 　 何香凝说，民革同各民主党派一样，在中国共产党的领导下，在1957年的反右派斗争和整风运动之后，经过两年的大跃进，在从资产阶级性政党转变为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量的长途中，又向前跨进了一大步；大多数成员在积极为社会主义服务的过程中，政治思想面貌也发生了很大的变化。她说，我们在自我改造方面所取得的一些进步，以祖国飞跃发展形势的要求来衡量，同广大劳动人民冲天干劲相比较，还有一段不小的距离，还必须不骄不馁地继续进行政治立场和思想的改造。
    何香凝说，当前，我国的社会主义事业，正在日益发展，步步深入。我们民革和各民主党派一起，一定要正确认识城市人民公社的重大意义，热烈支持这一具有历史意义的创举，跟上伟大的时代。
    程潜副委员长在发言中，谈到当前湖南省呈现的一派大好形势。他说，六十年代的第一个春天，湖南省工业生产、基本建设和交通运输方面的生产情况很好，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动正一浪高似一浪地向前发展，1、2月份生产稳步上升，进入了持续跃进的新阶段。全省农民干劲冲天，热情奔放，展开了规模宏伟、气势磅礴的以春耕为中心的大生产高潮。农业基本建设以史无前例的规模和速度在进行，许多地方已经出现了“高山人造海，渠道赛江淮，流水空中过，帆船岭上来”的新气象。程潜说，从湖南，看全国，我们对于实现1960年国民经济计划并且超额完成各项指标，具有绝对的信心。
    程潜在发言中还谈到台湾问题。他说，我们不能容忍美帝国主义还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，我们绝对不能容忍美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞，伟大的中国人民一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，实现祖国的完全统一。
    水利电力部部长傅作义就进一步发展水利电力工作作了发言。他指出，我国水利电力事业1959年又实现了继续大跃进。1959年全国建成了大批大中小型水库工程，共计完成土石方一百三十亿立方米，扩大灌溉面积七千万亩。这些工程对战胜去年的水旱灾害，保证农业生产的继续大跃进起了巨大作用。在电力工业方面，1959年的生产和基本建设，都大大超过了1958年。电力工业的飞跃发展，已使我国的电力生产水平在世界上所处的地位，发生了显著变化。1949年我国的发电量居世界第二十五位，1959年已跃居到第九位。傅作义说，从去年冬天起，各地掀起了更大的水利建设高潮。据最近统计，在这一高潮中全国扩大和改善的灌溉面积，已经超额完成了二亿六千万亩的计划。加上过去所修的工程，各个江河流域有了更加完整的水利系统，伟大祖国的山河面貌因之焕然一新。傅作义说，为了保证国民经济继续跃进的用电需要，1960年我国发电量将比1959年增长34％到40％，装机容量将比1959年增长31％，我们一定能够胜利地实现今年的继续跃进。 　 今天在大会上发言的还有：刘亚雄、舒新城、钱端有、张文金、刘九学、马豫真、王德滋。
    下午大会的讨论是在蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔代表团团长巴扬勒·贾尔卡赛汗同志发表演说之后进行的。今天大会的执行主席是：朱德、林伯渠、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、何香凝、刘伯承、林枫、吴玉章、谭政、杨明轩、林铁、李大章、邓颖超、徐特立、阿沛·阿旺晋美、李颉伯、王国藩、奎璧、钱学森、梅兰芳、周叔弢。
