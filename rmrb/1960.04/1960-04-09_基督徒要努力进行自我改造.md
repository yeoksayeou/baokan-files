Comrade Wu Yaozong said: In this excellent situation, Christians should strive for self-reform, further thwart the imperialists' conspiracy to use Christianity, and contribute more to the socialist construction of the motherland!

Under the brilliant light of the General Line, the people of the whole country are displaying boundless wisdom and strength; a magnificent and splendid picture of ten thousand horses galloping and a hundred flowers blooming is unfolding in New China. Technical innovation and technical revolution have become a nationwide movement; the foundation of the people's communes is also being consolidated day by day. Every day we open the newspaper, we can see countless inspiring facts; almost every news item, every article, records the pulse of the Great Leap Forward and depicts the heroic posture of the people of New China.

For more than a year, during several visits and inspections, I have been deeply educated in socialism time and time again. The soaring enthusiasm and selfless spirit of the working people have deeply moved me. They are working tirelessly day and night, completely oblivious to their personal gains and losses. At times, they even forget about eating, sleeping, and everything else about themselves. Their only urgent demand is to quickly change the impoverished and backward face of our country.

What I have seen is merely a small part of the Great Leap Forward, and my understanding is not profound, but even this little bit has allowed me to deeply appreciate the unparalleled vitality of the people of New China. No force can stop the people of New China from advancing towards a future of infinite light and beauty with giant strides.

While achieving brilliant success in socialist construction, the spiritual outlook of the people of New China is also undergoing profound changes. The spirit of putting others before oneself, mutual assistance and cooperation, and serving the people wholeheartedly has become the prevailing social ethos. The recent incidents in Pinglu, Shanxi, and Yingde, Guangdong, where workers, cadres, and soldiers risked their lives to rescue those poisoned by food and burned by fire, have shaken my heart. In socialist society, people are the most precious asset, and their value is given the highest importance. This new relationship between people has created countless miracles, making many things that were impossible in the old society possible.

The Self-Reform of Christians

The excellent situation requires us Christians to strengthen our self-reform, so that our political stance and thinking are in line with the direction of social development, and so that the work we do can adapt to the new situation.

Through more than two years of socialist education and the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, the vast majority of Christian believers and workers have improved their political understanding to varying degrees. We are beginning to recognize the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system; to recognize the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party; to recognize that Christians must proceed from the interests of the 650 million people, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and follow the socialist road. We have further recognized the ideological, spiritual, and lifestyle poisons that imperialism has inflicted on us, and recognized that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Christian workers have also begun to recognize their past exploitative class attributes of serving imperialism and the bourgeoisie, and therefore have a more urgent demand for self-reform.

Due to the general improvement of the political understanding of Christians, all kinds of reactionary elements within Christianity have been exposed and purged. The vast number of believers have shown more positive performance in their respective posts. Many people have become model workers and advanced workers, and have been commended; some have made contributions to technical innovation. Many believers from the working people expressed a strong sense of liberation and gratitude and love for the Party and Chairman Mao when talking about the sharp contrast between the new and old societies. Pastors have all made self-reform plans and actively participated in labor production and labor training. Many pastors have achieved good results on the production front. They learn from the worker and peasant brothers, go all out, are not afraid of fatigue, and do their work well under any difficult conditions. In their busy lives, they have not neglected church work. Because they participated in production, they began to understand the meaning of labor, recognized the glory of labor, and therefore felt an unprecedented physical and mental pleasure.

However, in the work of self-reform, there are still many problems among Christians, especially among Christian workers. In terms of following the socialist road, our thinking still often starts from a personal point of view, rather than from a collective point of view; our eyes still look more at the past and less at the future. When encountering contradictions between collective life and personal life, we still have resistance. For some people, the issue of the two roads of socialism and capitalism has not been completely resolved. In terms of accepting the leadership of the Party, we still have more or less doubts and concerns; we also do not have enough understanding of the Party's mass line. We still lack foresight and confidence in some new things; we are still prone to confusing the nine fingers with one finger. Because the new things have not profoundly infected us, we are prone to being content with the status quo in our efforts to reform ourselves, and even develop the idea that we have reformed almost enough, and are unwilling to make persistent efforts to move forward.

All of the above shows that the bourgeois standpoint and views still stubbornly occupy our minds. We have not only been deeply influenced by the bourgeois selfish individualism, but we have also been subjected for a long time to the slave mentality instilled by imperialism under the guise of religion, worshiping the West and despising our motherland; the decadent "way of life" and hypocritical "democracy" and "freedom" of the United States once attracted us. The ideological poisons of the bourgeoisie and imperialism have penetrated our bone marrow. Only through profound self-reform of our political stance and thinking can we stand with the broad masses of the people and better strive for socialist construction.

We should study more conscientiously, especially about the General Line and the international situation. In learning, we should open our minds, ask questions, inspire each other, and improve each other, because only in this way can we continuously progress in learning. While studying current affairs and policies, we should also conduct political theory studies, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works, because with a theoretical foundation, our understanding will be clearer and more solid.

Our learning should be well combined with practice. In addition to doing a good job in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, we should actively participate in labor production and labor training. Participating in labor is not just a formality; we must infuse the thoughts and feelings of the working people into our own blood in labor. In the past two years, through socialist education, we have understood some great principles; if we do not embody these great principles in practice, our transformation will still be castles in the air.

For us Christians, self-reform is a long-term, arduous, and repetitive task, but today's excellent situation is very conducive to our self-reform. Because self-reform is a long-term task, we should work even more actively and continuously. New China is undergoing earth-shaking changes, and even if we whip our horses, we are afraid of not keeping up with the situation; only by adopting a serious and hardworking attitude and striving for the upper reaches can we be consistent with the direction of historical evolution, take the initiative in doing things, feel comfortable, and make more contributions to the people.

Be Vigilant Against Imperialist Conspiracies

In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, imperialism headed by the United States is suffering more and more difficulties. The growing strength of the socialist camp, the disintegration within imperialism, and the surging national independence movements are all making the imperialist rulers feel stretched and bump into walls everywhere. The Soviet Union's amazing achievements in space technology have made the "warriors" of the Pentagon uneasy, and the "giant dragon" of New China has become a nightmare for the monopoly capitalists. In this situation, while continuing the Cold War and stepping up the expansion of armaments, U.S. imperialism has to make some gestures of peace and adopt a "peaceful" strategy, which is a strategy of fake peace and real preparation for war.

The so-called "peaceful strategy" is to promote the "internal evolution" of the socialist camp through subversion, division, and corruption, and to deceive the people of capitalist countries and national independence countries with the slogan of "peace." To implement the "peaceful strategy" is also to carry out "ideological diplomacy," "to extensively contact intellectuals in the communist camp, and finally political figures in the upper and middle levels, in order to gradually influence their thoughts and beliefs." The "peaceful strategy" is to "break gaps in the Iron Curtain" and "win victories in the ideological battle."

The "peaceful strategy" of imperialism deserves special vigilance from us Chinese Christians. In order to implement the "peaceful strategy," in terms of Christianity, in addition to continuing to make vicious propaganda against New China's religious policies and New China's churches, imperialism also attempts to continue to influence the thinking of Chinese Christians and continue to use Christianity to carry out aggression against China. They vainly hope that Chinese Christians will draw the line between the enemy and ourselves between belief and disbelief, that Chinese Christians will use individualism to confront collectivism, and that Chinese Christians will regard the enemy as friends and adopt a hostile attitude towards the Party and the people.

In order to conceal their conspiracies, the rulers of imperialism and their accomplices often put a religious cloak on the U.S. aggressive policy. At the time of Dulles' death, some Christian propagandists in the United States said that Dulles was a "faithful Christian"; Dulles' "position of strength" policy and "brink of war" policy were a manifestation of the "Christian spirit." In his State of the Union Address to Congress on January 7 this year, Eisenhower said: The reason why the United States has achieved "miraculous progress and achievements" is because the United States "adheres to principles and methods consistent with our religious ideas."

However, the religious cloak cannot hide the naked aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. Last December, Dalberg, chairman of the U.S. National Council of Churches, visited Taiwan; when someone mentioned the resolution passed by the U.S. churches at the Cleveland Conference in 1958 to recognize the People's Republic of China in order to create "two Chinas," he expressed his complete agreement with this proposition. Dalberg also said: "The U.S. National Council of Churches' opposition to communism has never changed; there may be differences of opinion regarding the strategy for dealing with communism, but we should use all material and spiritual forces to oppose communism, and there can be no different opinions on this point."

An American "theologian" known for his anti-communism, Niebuhr, not only supports the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, but also openly advocates the use of nuclear weapons to deal with communism from a "theological" point of view. In an article entitled "The Test of Christian Faith Today," he said: "Although the use of nuclear weapons is terrible, we should not deny the possibility of using nuclear weapons, because denying the use of nuclear weapons will put us in danger of surrendering to the enemy."

The ferocious face of imperialism has been fully exposed today. U.S. imperialism is stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, actively undermining the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and actively carrying out conspiracies to subvert socialist countries. Towards New China, U.S. imperialism has expressed extreme hatred, and it has used all means to slander New China in an attempt to reduce New China's growing prestige in the international community. U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan. The crimes of U.S. imperialism are countless; resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism and smashing all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism is a primary task of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and it is also a primary task of us Christians.

The Anti-Imperialist and Patriotic Tasks of Christians

It is a very clear fact that imperialism, in its death throes, not only wants to continue to use Christianity, but also wants to use Christianity more cleverly. However, no matter how insidious the methods of imperialism are, they cannot deceive the Christians of China.

This September marks the tenth anniversary of China's Three-Self Patriotic Movement in Christianity. The Three-Self Movement in Christianity is an anti-imperialist movement. The Chinese church accused imperialism of using Christianity to carry out aggression in China, cut off relations with imperialism, and realized the autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese church. This was a heavy blow to imperialism.

The awakened Chinese Christians are very familiar with the hypocritical face of imperialism under the guise of religion. We will never think that it has really laid down its butcher knife just because U.S. imperialism makes some peaceful gestures; we will never relax our vigilance against them just because imperialist elements express "friendship" to us. We resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" under any disguise. We also will never allow anyone to use the name of religion to glorify war and cover up aggression. We express extreme hatred for those who attempt to use "theology" to serve nuclear war; they are not only traitors to Christianity, but also public enemies of all peace-loving people in the world.

For Chinese Christians, to further combat imperialism, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the ideological poison of imperialism. For more than a year, the national and local organizations of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement have been conducting systematic and comprehensive research on imperialism's use of Christianity to carry out aggression in China. Through this research, we have a clearer understanding of the conspiracies of imperialism and the poison that imperialism has inflicted on us. We are determined to eradicate the poison of imperialism from the roots.

Not long ago, after the Shanghai judicial organs sentenced the counter-revolutionary and treasonous group headed by Gong Pinmei within Catholicism, they also sentenced the American spy Hua Lizhu, who had close ties with this counter-revolutionary and treasonous group and was wearing a religious cloak, and gave this American spy legal sanctions. This was a very gratifying thing. We religious believers feel boundless anger at the crimes of this imperialist spy. We resolutely support the just judgment of the judicial organs on this case. Although the rulers of imperialism are furious and furious, and say that Hua Lizhu's crimes are "religious," they cannot deny it in the face of overwhelming evidence, and their clamor only further exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism.

Christians in New China enjoy complete freedom of religious belief; those who believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion are all Chinese people, and are closely united in the big family of the motherland, working together to build a socialist New China. Imperialists attempt to use the issue of the relationship between belief and disbelief to sow discord and promote the strategy of "ideology", they are absolutely unable to succeed.

We want to combat imperialism, but we do not regard the good Christians and the broad masses of people in imperialist countries as our enemies. They are also poisoned by imperialism; eliminating the ferocious imperialism and achieving lasting world peace is a common task for them and us.

China's Three-Self Movement in Christianity is also a patriotic movement. To be patriotic is to make our ancient motherland quickly become a new, modern, and strong country; to be patriotic is to love socialism and serve socialism; to be patriotic is to make our church work and our religious life adapt to the socialist environment.

The Party liberated the disaster-stricken semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, and led the Chinese people to build a prosperous and happy New China. The Party also liberated us Christians from the clutches of imperialism and returned us to the embrace of the people. We must accept the leadership of the Party wholeheartedly in order to be anti-imperialist and patriotic and to carry out self-reform.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great call, urging the people of the whole country to work together with one heart and one mind under the brilliant light of the General Line, and to unite as one to strive for greater victories in the cause of socialist construction. We should resolutely respond to this inspiring call, mobilize all positive factors, devote ourselves to the movement to increase production and practice economy, and contribute more to the infinitely bright future of the motherland in different positions.

### 基督徒要努力进行自我改造

    基督徒要努力进行自我改造
    吴耀宗代表说：在大好的形势中，基督徒要努力自我改造，进一步打击帝国主义利用基督教的阴谋，为祖国社会主义建设贡献更多的力量！
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民正在发挥着无穷无尽的智慧和力量；新中国正呈现着一幅万马奔腾、百花齐放的雄伟绚丽图画。技术革新和技术革命已经成为一个全民性的运动；人民公社的基础也日益巩固。我们每天打开报纸，就可以看到无数使人振奋的事实；几乎每一则消息，每一篇文章，都纪录着大跃进的脉搏，描绘着新中国人民的豪姿。
    一年多以来，在几次参观和视察中，我一次又一次地受到深刻的社会主义教育。劳动人民的冲天干劲和大公无私的精神，深深地感动了我。他们夜以继日地进行着辛勤的劳动，他们完全没有想到个人的利害得失。有的时候，他们甚至忘记了饮食，忘记了睡眠，忘记了自己的一切，他们唯一的、迫切的要求，就是迅速地改变我国一穷二白的面貌。
    我所看见的，仅仅是大跃进的一鳞一爪，我的体会也不深刻，然而就是所见到的这一点，已经使我亲切地体会到新中国人民无比旺盛的生命力。任何力量都不能阻止新中国人民以巨人的步伐向着无限光明美好的前途迈进。
    在获得社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就的同时，新中国人民的精神面貌也发生着深刻的变化。先人后己、互助合作、全心全意为人民服务的精神，已经成为社会风气。最近在山西平陆和广东英德所发生的，抢救食物中毒和被火烧伤的民工、干部和战士的事件，震动了我的心弦。在社会主义社会中，人是最宝贵的财产，人的价值得到最高度的重视。这一个人与人之间的新关系，造成了无数奇迹，使许多在旧社会中不可能的事，都成为可能。
    基督徒的自我改造
    大好的形势要求我们基督徒加强自我改造，使我们的政治立场和思想与社会发展的方向相一致，使我们所做的工作能够适应新的形势。
    经过过去两年多的社会主义教育和大跃进形势的鼓舞，绝大多数的基督教信徒和工作人员，在政治认识上都有了不同程度的提高。我们开始认识社会主义制度的无比优越性；认识共产党的伟大和正确；认识基督徒必须从六亿五千万人民的利益出发，接受共产党的领导，走社会主义道路。我们进一步认识了帝国主义在思想上、灵性上、生活上所给我们的毒害，认识了美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界人民最凶狠的敌人。基督教工作人员也开始认识自己过去曾经为帝国主义和资产阶级服务的剥削阶级属性，因而产生了更迫切的自我改造的要求。
    由于一般基督徒政治认识的提高，基督教内形形色色的反动分子被揭发、被清除了。广大信徒在各自的岗位上，有了更积极的表现。有不少的人做了劳动模范，做了先进工作者，受到了表扬；有的人在技术革新工作上，作出了贡献。许多劳动人民成分的信徒，在谈到新旧社会的鲜明对比时，表达了强烈的翻身感、表达了他们对党和毛主席的感激和热爱。教牧人员都订出了自我改造规划，纷纷参加劳动生产和劳动锻炼。有不少的教牧人员，在生产战线上获得了较好的成绩。他们向工农弟兄学习，鼓足干劲，不怕劳累，在任何困难的条件下，都把工作做好。在他们繁忙的生活中，他们却没有把教会工作耽误。由于他们参加了生产，他们开始体会了劳动的意义，认识了劳动的光荣，因而感到身心上从未有过的愉快。
    但是，在自我改造的工作上，在基督徒当中，特别是在基督教工作人员当中，还存在着不少的问题。在走社会主义道路方面，我们的思想还是常常从个人观点出发，而不是从集体观点出发；我们的眼睛还是多看过去，少看未来。在遇到集体生活和个人生活之间的矛盾时，我们还会产生抵触的情绪。在有些人当中，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的问题，还没有得到彻底的解决。在接受党的领导方面，我们还或多或少地存在着怀疑和顾虑；我们对党的群众路线也没有足够的认识。对一些新生事物，我们还是缺乏远见，缺乏信心；我们还是容易把九个手指头和一个手指头混淆起来。由于新事物对我们的感染还不深刻，我们在自我改造的努力上，就容易安于现状，甚至产生已经改造得差不多的思想，不肯再接再厉，努力前进。
    以上这些都说明了资产阶级的立场和观点还是顽强地占据着我们的头脑。我们不但深深地受了资产阶级自私自利的个人主义思想影响，我们也长期地受了帝国主义在宗教外衣下所灌输给我们的崇拜西方、鄙视祖国的奴化思想影响；美国腐朽的“生活方式”，虚伪的“民主”“自由”曾经吸引过我们。资产阶级和帝国主义的思想毒素，曾经深入了我们的骨髓。只有进行政治立场和思想的深刻自我改造，才能使我们同广大人民站在一起，更好地为社会主义建设努力。
    我们应当更认真地进行学习，特别是关于总路线和国际形势的学习。在学习中，我们应当敞开思想，提出问题，互相启发，互相提高，因为只有这样，我们才能在学习中不断地进步。在学习时事政策的同时，我们也应当进行政治理论的学习，特别是对毛主席著作的学习，因为有了理论的基础，我们的认识就更加清楚，更加稳固。
    我们的学习应当很好地同实践结合起来。除了做好三自爱国运动的工作以外，我们应当积极地参加劳动生产和劳动锻炼。参加劳动不只是一种形式；我们要在劳动中把劳动人民的思想、情感灌输到我们自己的血液里面。在过去两年中，通过社会主义教育，我们多少懂得一些大道理；如果我们不在实践中把这些大道理体现出来，我们的改造就还是空中楼阁。
    进行自我改造，对我们基督徒来说，是一件长期的、艰巨的、反复的工作，但今天的大好形势对我们的自我改造是非常有利的。因为自我改造是一件长期的工作，我们就应当更加积极地不断努力。新中国正经历着翻天复地的变化，我们即使快马加鞭，还怕赶不上形势；只有采取认真的、刻苦的态度，力争上游，我们才能同历史演变的方向相一致，作事主动，心情舒畅，对人民多有一些贡献。
    警惕帝国主义的阴谋
    在东风压倒西风的形势下，以美国为首的帝国主义正遭受着愈来愈多的困难。社会主义阵营的日益强大，帝国主义内部的分崩离析、民族独立运动的风起云涌，这些都使帝国主义的统治者们捉襟见肘，到处碰壁。苏联空间技术的惊人成就更使五角大楼的“勇士”们惴惴不安，新中国这条“巨龙”也成了垄断资本家们的梦魇。在这样的情况下，美帝国主义在继续进行冷战，加紧扩张军备的同时，就不得不作出一些和平姿势，采取一套“和平”战略，这就是假和平、真备战的战略。
    所谓“和平战略”就是要通过颠复、分化、腐蚀等方法，来促成社会主义阵营的“内部演化”，用“和平”的口号来欺骗资本主义国家和民族独立国家的人民。要执行“和平战略”也就要进行“意识形态外交”，“同共产党阵营的知识分子，最后同上层和中层的政界人物广泛接触，以便逐渐影响他们的思想、信仰”。“和平战略”就是要“在铁幕上突破缺口”，“在思想战斗中取得胜利”。
    帝国主义的“和平战略”特别值得我们中国基督徒的警惕。为了执行“和平战略”，在基督教方面，除了对新中国的宗教政策，对新中国的教会，继续进行恶毒的宣传以外，帝国主义还企图继续影响中国基督徒的思想，继续利用基督教对中国进行侵略活动。他们妄想使中国基督徒把敌我界线划在信与不信之间，使中国基督徒用个人主义来对抗集体主义，使中国基督徒认敌为友、对党和人民采取敌视的态度。
    为了掩饰他们的阴谋，帝国主义的统治者和他们的帮凶们，常常让美国的侵略政策披上一件宗教外衣。在杜勒斯逝世的时候，美国基督教某些宣传家们，说杜勒斯是一个“忠实的基督徒”；杜勒斯的“实力地位”政策和“战争边缘”政策是“基督教精神”的表现。艾森豪威尔在今年1月7日向国会提出的国情咨文里说：美国所以获得“奇迹般的进步和成就”是由于美国“恪守同我们的宗教思想一致的原则和方法”。
    但是，宗教外衣掩盖不住美帝国主义赤裸裸的侵略阴谋。去年12月，美国基督教协进会主席达耳伯格访问了台湾；当有人提到1958年美国教会在克利扶兰会议上所通过的，为了制造“两个中国”而承认中华人民共和国”的决议时，他表示完全同意这个主张。达尔伯格又说：“美国基督教协进会反对共产主义的立场，是从来没有改变过的；关于对付共产主义的策略，可能存在着意见上的分歧，但我们应当用尽一切物质和精神的力量来反对共产主义，在这一点上，不可能存在着什么不同的意见。”
    美国一位以反共著名的“神学家”尼勃尔，他不只拥护美帝国主义的侵略政策，他还从“神学”的观点，公开主张用核武器来对付共产主义。在一篇题为“基督教信仰在今天的考验”的文章里，他说：“使用核武器虽然是很可怕的，但我们却不应当否定使用核武器的可能，因为否定使用核武器，将使我们面临屈服于敌人的危险。”
    帝国主义穷凶极恶的面貌，今天已经暴露无遗。美帝国主义正在加紧武装西德和日本，积极破坏亚非和拉丁美洲国家的民族独立运动，积极进行颠复社会主义国家的阴谋。对新中国，美帝国主义更表示了极度的仇恨，它用尽了一切方法来污蔑新中国，企图降低新中国在国际间日益增长的威信。美帝国主义还在霸占我国的领土台湾。美帝国主义的罪恶真是擢发难数；坚决地反对美帝国主义，粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋，这是中国人民和全世界人民的一项首要任务，也是我们基督徒的一项首要任务。
    基督徒的反帝爱国任务
    帝国主义在垂死的挣扎中，不只要继续利用基督教，并且要更巧妙地利用基督教，这是很清楚的事实。但是，帝国主义任何阴险的手法都欺骗不了中国的基督徒。
    今年9月，是中国基督教三自爱国运动发起的十周年。基督教的三自运动是反帝的运动。中国教会控诉了帝国主义利用基督教在中国进行侵略的罪行，割断了同帝国主义的关系，实现了中国教会的自治、自养、自传，这是对帝国主义一个沉重的打击。
    觉醒了的中国基督徒对帝国主义在宗教外衣下的伪善面目是非常熟悉的。我们绝对不会因为美帝国主义作出一些和平姿势，就认为它已经真的放下屠刀；我们绝对不会因为帝国主义分子向我们表示“友好”，我们就会对他们放松警惕。我们坚决反对在任何伪装下进行的制造“两个中国”的阴谋。我们也决不允许任何人用宗教名义来美化战争，来为侵略掩护。对那些企图用“神学”来为核战争服务的人们，我们表示极度的痛恨；他们不只是基督教的叛徒，他们也是全世界爱好和平的人民的公敌。
    对中国基督徒来说，要进一步打击帝国主义，就要彻底地肃清帝国主义的思想毒素。一年多以来，三自爱国运动的全国性组织和地方性组织，都进行着关于帝国主义利用基督教在中国进行侵略的系统的、全面的研究。通过这个研究，我们更清楚地认识了帝国主义的阴谋，和帝国主义所加给我们的毒害。我们决心把帝国主义的毒素，从根挖除。
    不久以前，上海司法机关在判决了天主教内以龚品梅为首的反革命叛国集团案件以后，又判决了与这个反革命叛国集团有着密切关系的、披着宗教外衣的美国间谍分子华理柱案件，给这个美国间谍分子以法律的制裁，这是一件大快人心的事。我们宗教信徒对这个帝国主义间谍分子的罪行，感到无比的愤怒。我们坚决拥护司法机关对这个案件的正义裁判。尽管帝国主义的统治者恼羞成怒，暴跳如雷，把华理柱的罪行说成是“宗教性”的，在如山的铁证面前，他们是无法抵赖的，他们的叫嚣，只有更加暴露美帝国主义的丑恶面目而已。
    新中国的基督徒享受着完全的宗教信仰自由；信仰宗教的和不信宗教的，都是中国人民，都在祖国的大家庭里，紧密地团结起来，为建设社会主义的新中国而共同努力。帝国主义者企图利用信与不信的关系问题来进行挑拨离间，来推行“意识形态”的战略，他们是绝对不能成功的。
    我们要打击帝国主义，但我们并不把帝国主义国家里面善良的基督徒和广大人民看作我们的敌人。他们同样地受到帝国主义的毒害；消灭凶恶的帝国主义，实现世界持久和平，这是他们和我们的共同任务。
    中国基督教的三自运动也是爱国运动。爱国就要使我们古老的祖国迅速地成为一个新生的、现代化的、强大的国家；爱国就要热爱社会主义，为社会主义服务；爱国就要使我们的教会工作和我们的宗教生活，适应社会主义的环境。
    党解放了灾难深重的半殖民地半封建的旧中国，领导着中国人民建设繁荣幸福的新中国。党也使我们基督徒从帝国主义的魔掌中解放出来，回到人民的怀抱。我们要反帝爱国，要进行自我改造，就必须全心全意地接受党的领导。
    党的八届八中全会发出了伟大的号召，要全国人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，同心同德，团结一致，为争取社会主义建设事业更大的胜利而奋斗。我们应当坚决地响应这个振奋人心的号召，调动一切积极因素，投入增产节约运动，在不同的岗位上，为实现祖国无限光明美好的前途，贡献更多的力量。
