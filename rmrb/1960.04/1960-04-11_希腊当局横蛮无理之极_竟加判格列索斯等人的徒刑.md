Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 10th: The Athens Court of Appeal brazenly rejected the appeals of Greek national hero Manolis Glezos and the president of the "Avghi" newspaper, Yannis Kirkos, on the 9th, and increased their sentences.

Glezos had published an appeal in "Avghi" calling on all good people around the world to intensify the struggle for Greek democracy. Glezos and Kirkos were therefore charged by the court with "insulting the authorities" and sentenced. Glezos and Kirkos appealed against this unreasonable verdict.

Despite the original judgment being groundless, the court still considered the original judgment valid and increased Glezos's sentence by two months (original sentence seven months) and Kirkos's sentence by one month (original sentence five months). "Avghi" was deprived of the right to obtain newsprint on a priority basis for ten days.

The Athens Military Tribunal had sentenced Glezos on July 23 last year, based on false accusations of "espionage activities", to nine years of deprivation of liberty, including five years of imprisonment; four years of concentration camp exile; and eight years of deprivation of political rights. Later, the Greek judicial authorities, using Glezos's appeal to the people of the world as an excuse, tried every possible means to intensify the persecution of Glezos and the president of "Avghi", Yannis Kirkos.

    希腊当局横蛮无理之极
    竟加判格列索斯等人的徒刑
    据新华社10日讯　雅典消息：雅典上诉法院9日悍然驳回了希腊民族英雄格列索斯和“黎明日报”社社长基尔科斯的上诉，并且对他们加判徒刑。
    格列索斯曾经在“黎明日报”发表了一项呼吁书，呼吁全世界善良的人们为争取希腊民主而加紧斗争。格列索斯和基尔科斯因此被法院加上了“侮辱当局”的罪名而判刑。格列索斯和基尔科斯对这种无理的判决提出上诉。
    尽管原判毫无根据，法院仍然认为原判有效，并且加判格列索斯两个月的徒刑（原判七个月），加判基尔科斯一个月的徒刑（原判五个月）。“黎明日报”被剥夺了十天优先取得白报纸的权利。
    雅典军事法庭去年7月23日曾经根据“间谍活动”的诬告，判决剥夺格列索斯自由九年，其中五年徒刑；集中营流放四年；剥夺政治权利八年。后来希腊司法当局又以格列索斯向世界人民发出呼吁为口实，千方百计地加紧迫害格列索斯和“黎明日报”社社长基尔科斯。
