    Advance Along the Road of Complete Women's Liberation Pointed Out by Lenin
    -- Written in Commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Cai Chang
    In the autumn of 1920, the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin, in his Kremlin office, discussed major issues related to the women's movement with his comrade-in-arms, Clara Zetkin. He began firmly and clearly: "Without Marxist theory, there can be no good practice, this is obvious. We communists also need the greatest principled purity on this issue." (Note 1) It was Lenin, based on the principles of Marxism, who pointed out to working women all over the world that "Only through communism can women achieve true liberation." "The communist women's movement itself must be a mass movement, it must be part of the overall mass movement." (Note 2) This is because in class society, the social status of women is determined by their class position. The most fundamental interests of working women are consistent with those of their class brothers. In colonial and semi-colonial countries oppressed by imperialism, the most fundamental interests of working women are consistent with the interests of national liberation. Only national liberation can lead to the liberation of the working class and the complete liberation of women. "Therefore, the status of women as human beings and members of society is inextricably linked to the private ownership of the means of production." "This also gives us reason to view the women's issue as a social issue, as part of the workers' issue, and thus enables us to closely link the women's issue with the proletarian class struggle and revolution." (Note 3)
    Our practice fully proves that Lenin's scientific analysis and brilliant instructions are completely correct. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied and developed Leninism based on the practice of the Chinese revolution. For more than 30 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, China's women's movement has been advancing along the road of complete women's liberation pointed out by Lenin. It has consistently regarded the women's movement as an indivisible part of our country's national democratic revolution, socialist revolution and construction, and the future transition to communism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Women make up half of the population. The economic position of working women and their particularly oppressed situation not only prove the urgent need for revolution but also determine the strength of the revolution's victory or defeat." (Note 4) The central tasks of the revolution formulated by the Party in various periods are the central tasks of the women's movement; combined with the realization of these central tasks, the women's issue is gradually resolved, women's rights are fought for, and the complete liberation of women is achieved. When our country was in a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal state, and when our revolution was in the era of the national democratic revolution, we actively mobilized the vast numbers of women to participate in this revolutionary struggle. We learned from our own experiences that when the territory of the motherland is trampled upon by imperialism, when the entire nation is oppressed by imperialism and domestic reactionary rule, and when one's own person and children are arbitrarily ravaged and killed, how can there be women's own rights and liberation without national independence and liberation? How can there be safety and happiness for children? Therefore, at that time, our Party mobilized the vast numbers of women to actively participate in the national democratic revolution through various forms of struggle. When the enemy armed to the teeth—imperialism—launched a military offensive against our people, the vast numbers of women heroically supported and participated in the war against imperialist aggression, defended their motherland, fought for national liberation, thereby protecting women's rights, protecting children's survival and happiness, and fighting for women's liberation. The spirit of heroic struggle displayed by the female workers of Petrograd and Moscow during the revolutionary period, praised by Lenin, and the heroic spirit displayed by Soviet women during the era of the domestic war and the Great Patriotic War in fighting alongside their fathers and brothers to defend their motherland, oppose imperialist intervention and domestic reactionary forces, and the fascist war, have always encouraged Chinese women to carry out revolutionary struggles tenaciously and forge ahead.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people and Chinese women experienced a long and arduous revolutionary war, and finally achieved the great victory of the people's democratic revolution in 1949, removing the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism from our heads. The Chinese people have stood up! The People's Republic of China was born! After political power belonged to the people, we were able to completely abolish all laws of inequality between men and women, as Lenin pointed out. The Common Program of the Political Consultative Conference promulgated at that time and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China promulgated in 1954 both stipulated that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life; marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state. The first law promulgated by our country was the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. It abolished the feudal marriage system of arranged and mercenary marriages and male chauvinism, stipulated a new marriage system of equality between men and women, and protected women and children, thereby enabling us to achieve equality between men and women in law and completing the first step in women's liberation.
    As Lenin pointed out, equality in "legal rights is not yet equality in real life" (Note 5). Under the teachings of the Party, Chinese women have demonstrated the spirit of continuous revolution and gradually striven to achieve "equality in real life" amid the continuous victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked our country's entry into a new era of socialist revolution. From then on, China's women's movement became a part of the socialist revolution and socialist construction movement. In the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, the vast numbers of women firmly stood on the side of the working class and socialism. In the land reform movement from 1950 to 1952, the socialist transformation movement from 1953 to 1956, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts after that, the vast numbers of women, under the leadership of the Party, actively participated and became a very active and revolutionary force. After the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, and after our country basically eliminated the system of class exploitation of man eating man, there was no longer any social system oppressing our working-class peasant women; and the women of the exploiting classes, under the leadership of the Party, were gradually transforming themselves into self-reliant laborers. From then on, Chinese women have achieved the happy life of liberation without oppression and exploitation that they have long yearned for for generations. This is a great victory achieved by Chinese women under the leadership of the Party in actively participating in the struggle between the two classes and the two roads.
    The victory of the national democratic revolution and the socialist revolution has cleared the most fundamental obstacles to the complete liberation of women, but this does not mean that the cause of complete women's liberation has been completed. Lenin pointed out: "To completely liberate women, to make her truly equal to men, there must be a public economy, women must participate in joint productive labor. In this way, women will be in the same position as men." (Note 6) Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out: "To build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities." "The demand that all women labor power... should all participate in the labor front should be realized in the shortest possible time." (Note 7) Our Party has always regarded mobilizing the vast numbers of women to participate in productive labor as the guiding principle of women's work, especially since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Party and the state have absorbed a large number of women to participate in various labors of socialist construction in the recovery and development of socialist economic construction. In 1958, the Party put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, which fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, so that unprecedented great leaps forward appeared on the various fronts of industrial and agricultural production and socialist construction, and created the new social organizational form of the people's commune. Our country's socialist construction entered a new stage of development at a higher speed than the period of the first five-year plan, thus opening up an unprecedentedly broad road for Chinese women to participate in social labor. In the past two years, almost all women with labor ability in rural areas have participated in various labors of the people's commune. In 1959, each woman with labor ability did an average of 250 workdays. In 1959, the number of female employees in our country soared from more than three million in 1957 to more than eight million; in addition, millions of women are enthusiastically working in industries and other undertakings run by urban people's communes and street offices. Hundreds of millions of women in our country have participated in various labors to build socialism, creating huge wealth for the country and playing a great role in promoting the high-speed development of socialist construction; at the same time, they have greatly improved the political, social, and family status of women and changed social perceptions. People praised and said: "Women's power is boundless, holding up half the sky in the Great Leap Forward." Under the education of the Party and in the training of collective labor and collective life, women themselves are becoming skilled social laborers with high socialist consciousness and a certain level of technical and cultural knowledge.
    The widespread participation of the broad masses of women in social labor is one of the most important signs of the complete liberation of women. However, in order to universally mobilize women to participate in social labor and give full play to women's enthusiasm and creativity in labor, and constantly improve labor efficiency, it is necessary to liberate women from trivial housework, and it is necessary to realize the socialization of housework. After agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production in our country began to break the backward state of one household being a production unit, and people carried out collective labor in agricultural cooperatives. After the people's commune, agricultural production developed more rapidly, and the scale of collective labor became larger and larger, and the contradiction with the individual life based on the family became more prominent. This decentralized individual way of life not only kept the vast numbers of women busy with trivial housework all day long and unable to participate in social labor wholeheartedly, but also made it impossible for many laborers to work and rest accurately according to the prescribed time, so the labor effect could not be improved rapidly. In order to solve the contradiction between collective production and individual life, it is necessary to thoroughly realize the socialization of housework and transform the heavy, trivial, and ignorant housework into large-scale socialist economic undertakings. This is not only a necessary condition for mobilizing women to participate in social labor more universally and improving labor efficiency, but also a necessary condition for organizing large-scale collective labor and ensuring the high-speed development of production, and it is also an important political task for developing the socialist camp, raising people's communist consciousness, cultivating communist factors, and realizing the complete liberation of women. As Lenin pointed out: "Only where the universal struggle against such trivial housework (led by the proletariat that has mastered state power) has begun, or rather, only where the trivial housework has begun to be universally transformed into a large-scale socialist economy, can there be true women's liberation, can there be true communism." (Note 8) "Let women participate in social productive labor, so that they will not be 'prisoners of housework', and do not always limit themselves to cooking and taking care of children (which will make their brains stupid and be despised by others). This is the main task." (Note 9)
    Our Party and state have consistently attached importance to and gradually realized the socialization of housework according to the development of our country's national economy. As early as the establishment of revolutionary base areas, efforts were made for this purpose. Since the founding of the country, we have advocated organizing breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, kindergartens, and public canteens in industrial and mining enterprises, and gradually developing them to street residents. In the early days of socialist transformation and construction, we advocated organizing baby-holding groups, busy farming nurseries, and mutual aid cooking in rural areas. All these have made the necessary preparations for the large-scale development of childcare organizations and public canteens. Since 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, driven by the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune, large numbers of housewives in urban and rural areas have been liberated from housework and participated in social labor, which makes it even more necessary for housework to be quickly and universally socialized. By the end of 1959, 400 million people in rural areas across the country were eating in public canteens, accounting for 73% of the total rural population. Urban public canteens are developing by leaps and bounds. According to statistics from 168 cities across the country by the end of March this year, more than 5 million people have already eaten in public canteens run by urban people's communes and street offices. Childcare centers, kindergartens, and other organizations in cities and villages have also developed greatly, and tens of millions of preschool children have received better social education than in their families in breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, and kindergartens. Many places have created comprehensive collective living and social service organizations based on public canteens and childcare organizations, developing from organizing major housework to comprehensively organizing collective life, and many new models of transforming scattered housework into large-scale socialist economy have emerged. The instructions of the great Lenin forty years ago are being universally realized in our country with 650 million people. This is a matter of great historical significance.
    The realization of the socialization of housework not only liberates women's labor power from housework but also liberates women's thinking from individual families. From collective labor and collective life, they have further realized the unparalleled superiority of our great socialist system and the infinite beauty of the great communist ideal, so their hearts are encouraged and they are full of energy. In the past, when many housewives met, they always talked about family life, husbands, and children. Now that they have left their families to participate in social labor, they talk about labor, technological innovation and technological revolution, public canteens, childcare centers, and service stations when they meet, and their socialist and communist consciousness has been greatly improved. Moreover, the development of this collective life not only helps to improve women's socialist and communist consciousness but also plays a very significant role in promoting the socialist and communist consciousness of all the people. Changing from individual life to collective life is a great revolution in life and a major event in transforming society and changing customs. People have once again experienced an extremely profound test in the face of such new things and in such a life, which has made them further appreciate the benefits of giving play to collectivism and realize that the collective way of life is the happiest way of life.
    Some comrades do not understand the important and far-reaching significance of running public canteens, childcare centers, kindergartens, and other work, and regard them as trivial matters of "old women." Such thinking is obviously very wrong. Let us see how Lenin cherished these undertakings. He called them specimens of communist seedlings. He said: "Public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens are specimens of these seedlings. There is nothing remarkable, ordinary, or common about these things. These things can actually liberate women and reduce and eliminate their inequality with men in social production and social life." He asked us to "describe the best canteen or nursery, use all means to turn some of them into model organizations, publicize them, and describe in detail how human resources can be saved under model communist work, how consumers can be facilitated, how products can be saved, how women can be liberated from family slavery, how sanitary conditions can be improved—all these can be done, can be promoted to the whole society, and can be promoted to the entire working masses." (Note 10) Our Party has always attached importance to collective life and welfare undertakings. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party in 1958 clearly pointed out: "The entire society and the entire commune should regard running public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective life and welfare undertakings, and doing service work well, as a noble work of serving the people. It is necessary to criticize and correct the exploitative class viewpoint that despises the welfare work of the masses' life and despises service labor." (Note 11) The current improvement of people's lives is carried out simultaneously from increasing personal income and developing collective life and welfare undertakings; under the principle of large collectives and small freedoms, the collective way of life is gradually made the main way of life in socialist society. To this end, we must earnestly run the collective life welfare undertakings and social service undertakings that are currently developing vigorously and growing up well, and gradually improve them, so as to thoroughly realize Lenin's great ideal of transforming trivial housework into a large-scale socialist economy.
    Why did Lenin call public canteens, childcare organizations, etc. specimens of communist seedlings? This is because he foresaw that in the future communist society, people's way of life must also be collective, and it must no longer be based on one household as a living unit. In the process of gradual development of socialist construction, it is inconceivable that large-scale collective production can coexist with this individual life based on the family for a long time. It can be imagined that the future communist society can never be built on the basis of the coexistence of collective production and individual life. The current individual family life is not only the last obstacle hindering the complete liberation of women but also the greatest waste of social labor power. In the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, it has begun to become an important obstacle to the rapid development of productive forces. Family relations are determined by social production relations, and it can also be said that they are a component of social production relations (in a broad sense). According to the law that production relations must meet the requirements of the development of productive forces, we must gradually and thoroughly realize the socialization of housework.
    When the imperialists attacked our country's people's commune, they especially attacked our socialization of housework, saying that we destroyed what they called a "happy family life." Let us take a look at the "happy family life" in imperialist countries. In their countries, the working people, both men and women, are worried about not having enough to eat or wear for their families every day. Most women do not get the opportunity to work and are always planning how to tighten their belts and use their husbands' meager wages to support their families. Fortunately, working women who get the opportunity to work are often discriminated against and humiliated in their work, busy with productive labor during the day and busy with trivial housework in the evening; the family is not their happy paradise but an unbreakable shackle. And it is precisely the capitalist system that destroys the families of the vast numbers of laborers. Many male workers, female workers, and male and female farmers dare not marry for a long time because they cannot afford family life. Many married laborers are also forced by life to be separated from their wives and children and have no family life for a long time, let alone any "family happiness." As for bourgeois families, although their husbands, wives, and children are reunited and there are servants to wait on them, superficially they live a "happy" life. In reality, the wife is just a toy bought by the husband with money, and she is often abandoned when he is tired of playing with her. Therefore, they live a life of jealousy, intrigue, and competition every day. At the same time, the capitalist system also forces hundreds of thousands of women to live a life of prostitution, becoming an indispensable supplement to the "happy families" of the bourgeoisie. In our socialist country, the working people will never envy the "happy family life" of capitalist countries. The clamor of the imperialists will only make us love the collective happy life that is developing vigorously even more and will not damage us in the slightest.
    Our actual life fully proves that the collective way of life is the inevitable result of the development of socialist collective large-scale production and is the happiest and most beautiful way of life. Women are liberated from housework, and everyone smiles and cheers. Is it happiness for men? In the past two years, a large number of housewives have participated in social labor. Couples participate in socialist construction together, receive communist education together, and care about national affairs together. Couples have common ideals and common careers, and their feelings are more intimate and their lives are more happy. In the past, in some families, the husband worked in society and the wife worked at home. One thought about national affairs and the other thought about family trivial matters, and they had no common language; one thought "I support you" and "You should serve me," and the other thought "Marry a man, marry a man, dress and eat." Such a relationship between husband and wife is essentially a master-slave relationship. If such a family life is called "happiness," it is "happiness" at the expense of women's interests. Since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of housewives have participated in social labor, family life has become more harmonious, more democratic, and more happy, and family disputes have been greatly reduced. Isn't this a good example?
    For children, should we rely on family education or social education to cultivate them into new people of communism? Actual life also proves that family education is necessary, but we should mainly rely on social education. When children are about three years old, they gradually have their own hobbies and requirements, which are inconsistent with those of adults. Children live in breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, and kindergartens. They are of similar age, and their physical and intellectual development is also similar; there are specialized nurses and educators responsible for childcare and education, there is food suitable for children, there is culture and entertainment suitable for children, and there is education suitable for children. It must be better than parents' education in the family. In childcare organizations across our country, the "Auntie Competition Mom Movement" is now being widely carried out. We already have thousands of aunties who are better than moms. They are carrying forward the communist spirit and are wholeheartedly cultivating these communist successors. We now have thousands of model childcare organizations, where children live very well and parents are satisfied.
    Furthermore, when eating in public canteens, the canteens have specialized cooks, those who cook are dedicated to cooking, those who stir-fry are dedicated to stir-frying, and they can make a variety of delicious dishes to meet the needs of all kinds of people. The more collective it is, the more variety of dishes there are, and the more it can meet the various needs of different people. Therefore, collective cooking is better and tastier than cooking in one household. Many male and female farmers have significantly enhanced their physiques because they eat better in public canteens than at home. Some people think that "only the food made by the wife is fragrant." This is essentially the bourgeois ideology and the habitual forces left over from the old society at work.
    Therefore, no matter which aspect you look at it from, collective life is much superior and happier than individual life. And as people's socialist and communist consciousness is increasing day by day, and as productive forces are developing by leaps and bounds, collective life welfare and social service undertakings are constantly developing and improving, and are increasingly showing its unparalleled superiority and infinitely bright future, and will more fully play its active role in promoting production and facilitating the masses.
    The family, like other social systems, is a product of historical development, and its role gradually changes with the development of the social and economic structure. Engels had already predicted decades ago: "As the means of production are transformed into social ownership, the individual family will no longer be the economic unit of society. Private housework will become social industry, and the care and education of children will become public affairs; society will be equally concerned about all children." (Note 12) This means that at that time, the family will not only no longer be an independent production unit but will also no longer be an independent consumption unit. All the life needs of the family, men, women, old, and young, will be supplied by society. Men and women will be able to completely unload the family burden that has weighed on them for thousands of years, so that everyone can enjoy a happier life. Of course, such a great ideal can only be fully realized in a communist society. Today, we can only gradually and actively develop collective life welfare and social service undertakings; we must continue to implement the system of distribution according to labor, so the working people must still bear certain responsibilities for the family, and there are still certain differences in the living standards of each family. In the future, after the transition from "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his work" to "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs," that is, from socialism to communism, this great ideal can be fully realized, and the communist seedlings that Lenin enthusiastically praised can grow into a forest that will last forever. By then, the complete liberation of women can finally be realized.
    "The liberation of the workers should be the work of the workers themselves, and the same is true of the liberation of working women, it should be the work of working women themselves." (Note 13) Chinese women have fully demonstrated in the long-term revolutionary struggle and in the current socialist construction that we infinitely love socialism and communism. In the teaching and practical struggle training of the Party, we have been made to dare to do anything, can do anything, and can do anything well. In the future, our women must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, hold even higher the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the general line of building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, actively participate in various tasks such as political, economic, cultural, educational, and living services for building socialism, give full play to initiative and revolutionary pioneering spirit, continuously revolutionize, and continuously advance, and strive to build a great socialist country and realize the beautiful ideal of communism in the future, go through the sunshine avenue of communism, and complete the great cause of the complete liberation of women.

    循着列宁所指引的妇女彻底解放的道路前进
    ——为纪念列宁诞生九十周年而作
    蔡畅
    1920年秋天，伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁，在克里姆林宫办公室和他的战友——克拉拉·蔡特金畅谈了有关妇女运动的重大问题，开头他就坚毅而明确地说：“没有马克思主义理论，就不可能有好的实践，这是很明显的。我们共产党人在这问题上也需要莫大的有原则的纯洁性。”（注一）正是列宁根据马克思主义的原则精神，向全世界劳动妇女指出了，“只有通过共产主义，妇女才能获得真正的解放。”“共产主义的妇女运动本身必须是群众运动，必须是总的群众运动的一部分。”（注二）这是因为在阶级社会里，妇女的社会地位，决定于她们所处的阶级地位，劳动妇女的最根本的利益是和她们的阶级兄弟一致的。在被帝国主义压迫的殖民地、半殖民地国家，劳动妇女的当前的最根本的利益，又是和民族解放的利益相一致的，只有民族解放才能进入工人阶级的解放，进入妇女的彻底解放。“所以妇女作为人与社会成员的地位，是与生产工具私有制有着不可分割的联系。”“这也使我们有所根据来把妇女问题看作是社会问题、工人问题的一部分，因而使我们能把妇女问题同无产阶级阶级斗争和革命紧紧地联系起来。”（注三）
    我们的实践，完全证明列宁的科学分析和英明的指示是完全正确的。毛泽东同志根据中国革命的实践，创造性地运用和发展了列宁主义。三十多年来，我国妇女运动在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，是沿着列宁所指引的妇女彻底解放的道路前进的。一贯把妇女运动当作我国民族民主革命、社会主义革命和建设、以及将来过渡到共产主义这些伟大斗争不可分割的一部分。毛泽东同志指出：“妇女占人口的半数，劳动妇女在经济上的地位和她们特别受压迫的状况，不但证明妇女对革命的迫切需要，而且是决定革命胜败的一个力量。”（注四）党所制定的各个时期的革命中心任务，就是妇女运动的中心任务；结合实现这些中心任务，逐步解决妇女问题，争取妇女权利，达到妇女彻底解放。当我们国家处在殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的状态，当我国革命处在民族民主革命时代，我们就积极发动广大妇女参加了这个革命斗争。我们从自己的亲身经历中体会到：当祖国的领土被帝国主义践踏，当整个民族受帝国主义和国内反动统治的压迫，当自己的人身和儿女任意被蹂躏和杀害的时候，没有民族的独立和解放，哪能有妇女自身的权利和解放呢？哪能有儿女的安全和幸福呢？因此当时我们党发动广大妇女通过各种各样的斗争形式，积极参加民族民主革命。当武装到牙齿的敌人——帝国主义向我国人民发动军事进攻的时候，广大妇女英勇地支援和参加了反对帝国主义侵略的战争，捍卫自己的祖国，争取民族解放，从而保卫妇女权利，保卫儿童的生存和幸福，争取妇女解放。列宁所赞扬的彼得格勒、莫斯科女工在革命时期所表现的英勇斗争的精神，苏联妇女在国内战争和卫国战争时代所表现的为捍卫祖国，反对帝国主义干涉和国内反动势力、以及法西斯战争，和自己的父兄一起并肩作战的英勇气概，一直鼓舞着我国妇女顽强地进行革命斗争，奋发前进。
    我国人民和我国妇女在中国共产党领导下，经历了长期艰苦的革命战争，终于在1949年取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利，从我们头上掀掉了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山。中国人民站起来了！中华人民共和国诞生了！在政权归于人民以后，我们才能像列宁所指出的那样，彻底废除了一切男女不平等的法律。在当时公布的政治协商会议共同纲领和1954年公布的中华人民共和国宪法上，都规定了妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭生活各方面，均享有同男子平等的权利；婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童，受国家的保护。我国颁布的第一个法律就是中华人民共和国婚姻法。它废除了包办买卖的、男尊女卑的封建主义婚姻制度，规定了男女平等，保护妇女儿童的新婚姻制度，从而我们才实现了男女在法律上的平等，走完了妇女解放的第一步。
    正如列宁所指出的，妇女在“法律上的平等还不是实际生活中的平等”（注五）。我国妇女在党的教导下，发挥了不断革命的精神，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设不断胜利中，逐步争取实现“实际生活中的平等”。1949年中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国进入了社会主义革命的新时代。从此我国妇女运动就成为社会主义革命和社会主义建设运动的一部分，在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中，广大妇女坚定地站在工人阶级和社会主义这一边。1950—1952年的土地改革运动，1953年到1956年的社会主义改造运动，以及这以后政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，广大妇女群众在党的领导下，都踊跃地参加了，成为非常积极的活跃的革命力量。在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成，我们国家基本上消灭了人吃人的阶级剥削制度以后，就再也没有任何社会制度压迫我们工农劳动妇女了；而剥削阶级妇女也在党的领导下，正在逐步地把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。我国妇女从此实现了世世代代长期向往的没有压迫没有剥削的解放了的幸福生活。这是我国妇女在党的领导下积极参加两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    民族民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，为妇女的彻底解放扫除了最根本的障碍，但这并不是说妇女彻底解放的事业已经完成了。列宁指出：“要彻底解放妇女，要使她与男子真正平等，就必须有公共经济，必须让妇女参加共同的生产劳动。这样，妇女才会和男子处于同等地位。”（注六）毛泽东同志同样指出：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动。具有极大的意义。”“使全部妇女劳动力，……一律参加到劳动战线上去，这个要求，应当在尽可能短的时间内，予以实现。”（注七）我们党一贯把发动广大妇女参加生产劳动作为妇女工作的方针，特别是从中华人民共和国成立以后，党和国家就在社会主义经济建设的恢复和发展中，吸收了大量妇女参加社会主义建设的各项劳动。1958年党提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，充分调动了全国人民的积极性，使工农业生产和社会主义建设各个战线上出现了空前的大跃进，并创造了人民公社这一个崭新的社会组织形式，我国社会主义建设进入了比第一个五年计划时期更高的速度向前发展的新阶段，从而为我国妇女参加社会劳动开辟了前所未有的宽广道路。近两年来，农村有劳动能力的妇女几乎全部参加了人民公社的各项劳动，1959年平均每个有劳动能力的妇女做了二百五十个工作日。1959年我国女职工从1957年的三百多万人激增到八百多万人；此外还有几百万妇女正在城市人民公社办的和街道办的工业和其他事业中热情地劳动着。我国亿万妇女参加了建设社会主义的各项劳动，为国家创造了巨大的财富，对于高速度发展社会主义建设起了极大的促进作用；同时也大大地提高了妇女在政治上、社会上和家庭里的地位，改变了社会上的观感。人们称赞说：“妇女力量大无边，顶住跃进半边天”。妇女们自己也在党的教育下，在集体劳动和集体生活的锻炼中，正在成为有高度社会主义觉悟、有一定技术文化水平的熟练的社会劳动者。
    广大妇女群众普遍参加社会劳动，这是妇女彻底解放的一个最重要的标志。但是，为着普遍动员妇女参加社会劳动，并充分发挥妇女在劳动中的积极性和创造性，不断地提高劳动效率，就必须把妇女从琐碎的家务劳动中解放出来，必须实现家务劳动的社会化。农业合作化后，我国的农业生产开始打破了一家一户就是一个生产单位的落后状态，人们在农业合作社里进行集体劳动。人民公社化后，农业生产更加迅速地发展，集体劳动的规模愈来愈大，同以家庭为单位的个体生活之间的矛盾更加突出。这种分散的个体生活方式，不但使广大妇女终日忙于琐碎的家务，不能全心全意参加社会劳动；而且使众多的劳动者都不能准确地按规定的时间劳动和休息，因而劳动效果不能迅速提高。为着解决集体生产和个体生活之间的矛盾，就必须彻底实现家务劳动的社会化，把繁重的、琐碎的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造为大规模的社会主义经济事业。这不仅是更普遍地动员妇女参加社会劳动和提高劳动效果的必要条件，而且是组织大规模的集体劳动，保证生产高速度发展的必要条件，又是发展社会主义阵地，提高人们的共产主义觉悟，培植共产主义因素，实现妇女彻底解放的重要的政治任务。正像列宁所指出的：“只有在反对这种琐碎家务的普遍斗争（为掌握国家权力的无产阶级所领导的）开始了的地方，更确切地说，只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”（注八）“让妇女参加社会生产劳动，使她们不要做‘家务事的俘虏’，不要永远把自己仅仅限制在作饭和照料小孩的圈子里（这会使她们脑子变笨和受人卑视）。这就是主要的任务。”（注九）
    我们党和国家一贯重视并根据我国国民经济发展情况，逐步实现家务劳动的社会化。早在建立革命根据地的时候，就为此而进行努力。建国以来，我们就在工矿企业中提倡组织哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂，并使它们逐步向街道居民群众中发展。在社会主义改造和建设的初期，我们就在农村提倡组织抱娃娃组、农忙托儿所和互助做饭。所有这些都为现在大量发展托儿组织和公共食堂做了必要的准备。1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社推动下，城乡大批家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动，这就更加必须使家务劳动迅速地普遍地实现社会化。到1959年底，全国农村有四亿人在公共食堂吃饭，占农村总人口的73％。城市公共食堂正在飞跃发展，到今年3月底止，全国一百六十八个城市的统计，已经有五百余万人在城市人民公社和街道办的公共食堂吃饭。城市和乡村的托儿所、幼儿园等组织也有很大的发展，学龄前的儿童已经有几千万人在哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园中得到比家庭更好的社会教养。许多地方创造了以公共食堂、托儿组织为基础的综合性的集体生活和社会服务组织，由组织主要家务向全面组织集体生活发展，已经出现了很多把分散的家务劳动改造成为社会主义大经济的新的典型。四十年前伟大列宁的指示，正在有六亿五千万人口的我国普遍实现。这是一件有着巨大历史意义的事情。
    实现家务劳动社会化，不但把妇女劳动力从家务中解放了出来，而且把妇女的思想从个体家庭中解放了出来。她们从集体劳动和集体生活中，更进一步认识了我们伟大的社会主义制度的无比优越，伟大的共产主义的理想无限美好，因而人心振奋，全身是劲。过去许多家庭妇女见面的时候，总是讲家庭生活、讲丈夫、讲孩子。现在她们走出家庭参加了社会劳动，见面时就谈劳动，谈技术革新和技术革命，谈公共食堂，谈托儿所、服务站，她们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟大大地提高了。而且这种集体生活的发展，不仅有助于妇女的社会主义共产主义觉悟的提高，对于全体人民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的提高，也起了极显著的促进作用。由个体生活改变为集体生活，这是生活上的大革命，是改造社会，移风易俗的大事。人们又在这样的新事物面前，在这样的生活中，经历了一次极为深刻的考验，使他们更进一步地体会了发挥集体主义的好处，体会了集体生活方式是最幸福的生活方式。
    有些同志不了解办公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等工作的重大的深远的意义，当作是“婆婆妈妈”的小事。这样的思想显然是十分错误的。让我们看看列宁是如何珍视这些事业的，他把它们称为共产主义的幼芽。他说：“公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园是这些幼芽的标本，是没有什么了不起的、平凡的、普通的东西，这些东西实际能够解放妇女，减少和消除她们在社会生产和社会生活上同男子的不平等。”他要求我们“描写最好的食堂或托儿所，用一切办法使它们中间的某些组织变为模范组织，宣扬它们，并详细描述在模范的共产主义工作下能够怎样节省人力，怎样便利消费者，怎样节省产品，怎样把妇女从家庭奴隶境遇中解放出来，怎样改善卫生条件——这一切都能做到，能推广到全社会，推广到全体劳动群众中去。”（注十）我们党一贯重视集体生活福利事业，1958年我们党的八届六中全会决议中明确指出：“使整个社会和整个公社把办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和其他集体生活福利事业，作好服务性工作，看成是为人民服务的一种崇高的工作。要批判和纠正那种轻视群众生活福利工作、轻视服务性劳动的剥削阶级观点。”（注十一）当前改善人民生活，是从增加个人收入和发展集体生活福利事业同时进行；在大集体小自由的原则下，逐步使集体生活方式成为社会主义社会的主要生活方式。为此，我们一定要认真地把现在正在蓬蓬勃勃发展成长起来的集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业办好，而且逐步提高，以彻底实现列宁的把琐碎家务改造成为社会主义大经济的伟大理想。
    列宁为什么把公共食堂、托儿组织等称为共产主义幼芽的标本呢？这是由于他预见到在将来的共产主义社会，人们的生活方式也必然是集体的，而决不能再以一家一户为生活单位。在社会主义建设逐步发展的过程中，不能设想大规模的集体生产，能够同这种以家庭为单位的个体生活长期并存。可以设想，未来的共产主义社会决不能建立在集体生产和个体生活并存的基础上。现在个体的家庭生活，不但是妨碍妇女彻底解放的最后一重障碍，而且是社会劳动力的最大浪费，在工农业生产大跃进中，它已经开始成为生产力飞跃发展的一个重要障碍。家庭关系是由社会生产关系决定的，也可以说是社会生产关系（广义的）的一个组成部分。根据生产关系适合生产力发展要求的规律，我们必须逐步地彻底地实现家务劳动社会化。
    帝国主义者在攻击我国的人民公社的时候，特别攻击我们的家务劳动社会化，说我们破坏了什么“幸福的家庭生活”。让我们来看一看帝国主义国家的“幸福的家庭生活”吧。在他们国家里，劳动人民不论男女都为着一家老幼的吃不饱、穿不暖而天天发愁，绝大部分妇女得不到就业的机会，整天盘算着怎样束紧裤带，用丈夫的少得可怜的工资来支持一家的生活。幸而得到就业机会的劳动妇女，在劳动中也常常受歧视、受侮辱，白天忙于生产劳动，晚间忙于料理琐碎家务；家庭并不是她们的幸福的乐园，而是挣不脱的枷锁。而且正是资本主义制度，破坏了广大劳动者的家庭，不少男工、女工、男女劳动农民，因为负担不起家庭生活，长期不敢结婚。有不少已婚的劳动者，也因为生活所迫，妻离子散，长期没有家庭生活，更谈不到什么“家庭幸福”。至于资产阶级家庭，她们固然夫妻子女团聚，还有婢仆侍候，表面上过着“幸福”的生活，实际上妻子不过是丈夫用钱买来的玩意儿，玩厌了就往往被抛弃。因此她们天天过着争风吃醋、勾心斗角的生活。同时资本主义制度还迫使成千上万的妇女过着卖淫生活，成为资产阶级“幸福家庭”的不可缺少的补充。在我们社会主义国家，劳动人民是从来也不会羡慕资本主义国家那种“幸福的家庭生活”的。帝国主义者的叫嚣，只会使我们更加热爱正在蓬勃发展的集体的幸福生活，而无损于我们的一根毫毛。
    我们的实际生活完全证明，集体生活方式是社会主义集体大生产发展的必然结果，是最幸福最美好的生活方式。妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，个个笑逐颜开，人人欢欣鼓舞。对男子来说，是不是幸福呢？近两年来，大量家庭妇女参加了社会劳动，夫妇共同参加社会主义建设，共同受共产主义教育，共同关心国家大事。夫妇之间有了共同的理想，共同的事业，感情也就更加亲密，生活也就更加幸福。过去有些家庭，丈夫在社会上劳动，妻子在家里劳动，一个想国家大事，一个想家庭琐事，没有共同语言；一个想“我养活你”“你应该侍候我”，一个想“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”。这样的夫妇关系，实质上是主奴关系，如果把这种家庭生活称为“幸福”，那就是牺牲妇女利益的“幸福”。大跃进以来，大量家庭妇女参加了社会劳动，家庭生活更加和睦，更加民主，更加幸福，家庭纠纷大大减少，这不是很好的例证吗？
    对孩子来说，究竟依靠家庭教养还是社会教养来把他们培育成为共产主义的新人呢？实际生活也证明，家庭教育是必要的，但主要应该依靠社会教育。孩子到三岁左右，就逐渐有自己的爱好和要求，这种要求与成人是不一致的。孩子在哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园生活，年龄相仿，身体和智力的发展也相仿：有专门的保育员、教养员负责保育和教育工作，有适合孩子的饮食，有适合孩子的文化娱乐，有适合孩子的教育，一定比父母在家庭教养得更好。在我国各地的托儿组织中，现在正广泛开展“阿姨赛妈妈运动”，我们已经有千千万万个赛过妈妈的阿姨，她们发扬了共产主义精神，正在全心全意地培养这些共产主义接班人。我们现在已经有成千上万个模范的托儿组织，在那里孩子生活得很好，家长称心满意。
    再说在公共食堂吃饭，食堂有专门的炊事人员，做饭的专管做饭，炒菜的专管炒菜，就可以做出多种多样美味可口的饭菜，满足各种各样人的需要。越是集体化，饭菜花样越多，越能满足不同人们的各种不同需要。所以集体做饭比一家一户做得好、吃得好。许多男女农民，由于在公共食堂吃饭，比家里吃得好，体质显著地增强了。有的人认为只有“老婆做的饭才香”，这实质上是资产阶级思想和旧社会遗留下来的习惯势力在作怪。
    所以不论从哪一方面来看，集体生活总比个体生活优越得多、幸福得多。而且随着人们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的日益提高，随着生产力的飞跃发展，集体生活福利和社会服务事业正在不断发展和提高，正在日益显示它的无比的优越性和无限美好的前途，必将更充分地发挥它促进生产、便利群众的积极作用。
    家庭也像其他社会制度一样，是历史发展的产物，它的作用是随着社会经济结构的发展而逐渐变化的。恩格斯早在几十年前就已经预言：“随着生产资料转化为社会公有，个体家庭也不会再是社会的经济单位。私人的家务将变为社会的工业。孩子的照顾和教养将成为公众的事情；社会将同等地关怀一切儿童。”（注十二）这就是说，那时候家庭不但不再成为一个独立的生产单位，而且不再成为一个独立的消费单位，一家男女老幼的一切生活需要，都由社会来负责供应，男女都能够彻底卸下几千年来压在身上的家庭负担，从而大家都能够享受更加幸福的生活。当然，这样一个伟大的理想，要到共产主义社会才能完全实现。今天，我们还只能逐步而又积极地发展集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业；还必须继续贯彻按劳分配的制度，因而劳动人民对家庭还必须负一定的责任，各个家庭的生活水平还有一定的差异。在将来从“各尽所能，按劳分配”过渡到“各尽所能，按需分配”，即从社会主义过渡到共产主义以后，这个伟大的理想才能全部实现，列宁所热烈颂扬的共产主义的幼芽，就能长成万古长青的森林。到了那时候，妇女的彻底解放才能最后实现。
    “工人的解放应当是工人自己的事情，同样，劳动妇女的解放也应当是劳动妇女自己的事情。”（注十三）我们中国妇女在长期的革命斗争中，在当前的社会主义建设中，已经充分表现了我们无限热爱社会主义、共产主义事业，在党的教导和实际斗争锻炼中，已经使我们什么也敢干，什么也能干，什么也干得好。今后我们妇女一定要在中国共产党领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社，积极地参加建设社会主义的政治、经济、文化教育、生活服务等各项工作，充分发挥积极性和革命的首创精神，不断革命，不断前进，为建设伟大的社会主义国家，为在将来实现共产主义的美好理想而奋勇前进，通过共产主义的阳关大道，完成妇女彻底解放的伟大事业。
