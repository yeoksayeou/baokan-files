　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia Telegram: Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Zhivkov said on the 2nd at the Bulgarian National Agricultural Irrigation Conference: "The irrigation problem is a major task that must be resolved in Bulgarian agriculture in the near future. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers are very concerned about this issue and have formulated a plan to widely develop water conservancy construction."

　　This agricultural irrigation conference was held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city.

　　Zhivkov pointed out at the meeting that the further upsurge of Bulgarian agriculture depends on three factors: irrigation, fertilization, and mechanization. He said that among these three factors, irrigation is of paramount importance. A characteristic of Bulgaria's climatic conditions is that it is very dry in the summer. If sufficient moisture cannot be guaranteed for crops, even with a high degree of mechanization and sufficient fertilizer, complete results can never be achieved.

　　Zhivkov then said that the guiding principle of the water conservancy construction movement widely carried out in Bulgaria last year was to build small reservoirs and ponds. This is correct because the construction of small reservoirs and ponds utilizes the labor of members of agricultural cooperatives and the funds of agricultural cooperatives, and it has quickly achieved results. He also told the people attending the meeting that entrusted by the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, a group composed of scientific workers, experts, and people with practical experience is studying the future development of agricultural irrigation in Bulgaria and will submit suggestions to the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee.

　　Finally, Zhivkov called on the Bulgarian Communist Party state committee secretaries, state people's congress chairmen and vice chairmen, machine tractor station chiefs, water conservancy engineers, agricultural cooperative chairmen, agronomists, and others attending the meeting to continue to work hard and strive for new achievements in water conservancy construction and in mastering every inch of irrigated land.

　　At the beginning of the meeting, Bulgarian Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yurukov made a report on the issues and tasks related to mastering irrigated land and irrigating crops. After the report, the meeting held discussions. The reports and speeches at the meeting showed that Bulgaria has made brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction last year.

    广泛开展水利建设  迅速解决灌溉问题
    日夫科夫谈保农业发展关键
    保加利亚农业的进一步高涨，灌溉问题具有头等重要的意义。
    因此，保加利亚共产党中央和部长会议非常关心这一问题，并订出了广泛开展水利建设的计划。
    去年保加利亚广泛开展的水利建设运动的方针主要是修建小型水库和贮水池，收效很快，这是正确的。
    新华社索非亚电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫2日在保加利亚全国农业灌溉会议上讲话时说：“灌溉问题是保加利亚农业中在最近的将来必须解决的一个主要任务。正因为如此，党中央和部长会议非常关心这一问题，并订出了广泛开展水利建设的计划”。
    这次农业灌溉会议是在保加利亚第二大城市普罗夫迪夫市举行的。
    日夫科夫在会上指出，保加利亚农业的进一步高涨取决于三个因素，即灌溉、施肥和机械化。他说，在这三个因素中，灌溉具有头等重要的意义。保加利亚气候条件的特征是在夏天非常干旱。如果不能保证农作物有足够的水分，即使有高度的机械化和充足的肥料，也绝不能收到完全的效果。
    日夫科夫接着说，去年保加利亚广泛开展的水利建设运动的方针主要是修建小型水库和贮水池。这是正确的，因为修建小型水库和贮水池利用了农业合作社社员的劳动和农业社的资金，而且很快就收到了效果。他还告诉出席会议的人们说，受保共中央委托，一个由科学工作者、专家和有实际经验的人组成的小组，正在研究保加利亚农业灌溉的未来发展问题，并且将向保共中央提出建议。
    日夫科夫最后号召出席会议的保共州委书记、州人民会议主席和副主席、机器拖拉机站站长、水利工程师、农业合作社主席、农业家等继续努力工作，争取在水利建设方面和在掌握每一寸水浇地方面取得新的成就。
    会议开始时，保加利亚农林部第一副部长尤鲁科夫曾经作了有关掌握水浇地和灌溉农作物问题和任务的报告。报告结束后，会议进行了讨论。会上的报告和发言表明，去年保加利亚在水利建设方面取得了辉煌成绩。
