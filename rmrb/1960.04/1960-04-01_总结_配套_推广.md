    Summary, Integration, Promotion
    Yu Yang
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is advancing rapidly along a correct, scientific, and nationwide path. In many cities and enterprises, new creations emerge almost every day. These creations have increased production efficiency many times, ten times, or even a hundred times.
    As the movement has developed to this stage, it is urgently necessary for us to summarize the diverse creations in a timely manner to improve them; to gather scattered experiences to integrate them into complete sets; and to promote and persist with the existing advanced experiences. This is an important link in consolidating the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution, and also an important link in promoting the better continued development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Where there is creation, there must be summary, improvement, and promotion; with a large number of creations, they must be made complete sets and series. Only in this way can the various creations of the masses play the greatest role. And improved and integrated experiences can be promoted more quickly and smoothly.
    Today, this newspaper published the experience of the Tianjin Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory in creating, summarizing, integrating, and promoting simultaneously, which powerfully illustrates this principle. The factory mobilized the masses to report their experiences and, using the method of side-by-side demonstration, collected 136 advanced experiences in two hours, integrating them into 31 sets according to the work process, so that each of the 31 work processes in the entire workshop had a complete set of experiences. It is very obvious that when these experiences changed from being sporadic and scattered to being complete sets, their vitality greatly increased. Each experience was selected and improved in the process of summarizing and integrating, and after being integrated into complete sets, the previously scattered and isolated experiences became a complete set of interconnected experiences, which greatly increased its use value and role.
    There are two methods for summarizing, integrating, and promoting advanced experiences. One is to believe that summarizing and integrating is a process of improvement that can only be done by a few people. This is the expert line method, the slow, poor, and wasteful method. The other is the mass line method of mobilizing the masses to gather ideas, the method of more, faster, better, and more economical. The "market" approach created by the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory is a mass line approach to summarizing, integrating, and promoting advanced experiences. As the saying goes, "One does not know the difficulty until one has experienced it." People who have gone through practice know the value of each creation best. Organizing the broad masses of workers to "go to the market," letting them find their own experiences, integrate them themselves, appraise them on the spot, compare them on the spot, and gather the best experiences together ensures that they are integrated quickly and well. It is precisely for this reason that the integration work has transcended the scope of the immediate new creation and formed "integration of new and old experiences," "integration of large and small experiences," "integration of indigenous and foreign experiences," and "integration of experiences inside and outside the factory." The best and most suitable are allowed to be integrated into complete sets and series.
    May everyone come to do the work of summarizing, integrating, and promoting. May everyone work hard to make the technical innovation and technical revolution movement develop more deeply, broadly, and rapidly.

    总结　配套　推广
    于羊
    技术革新和技术革命运动正沿着正确的、科学的和全民的轨道，迅猛异常地前进着。许多城市和企业，几乎每一天都有新的创造出现。这些创造，成倍地、成十倍地，甚至成百倍地提高了生产效率。
    运动发展到了这样一个阶段，就迫切需要我们把多种多样的创造及时加以总结，使之提高；把分散的经验汇集起来，使之配搭成套；把已有的先进经验推广开来，坚持下去。这是巩固技术革新和技术革命成果的重要环节，也是促进技术革新和技术革命运动更好地继续发展的重要环节。有创造就必须有总结、提高、推广；有了大量的创造就必须使它们成套、成列。这样才能使群众的各种创造发挥最大的作用。而提高了的，配成了套的经验，也才能更迅速地、更顺利地推广。
    今天本报发表了天津大中华橡胶厂边创造、边总结、边配套、边推广的经验，就有力地说明了这个道理。这个厂发动群众自报经验，用边说边表演的方法，在两小时内，就收集了一百三十六项先进经验，按工序配成了三十一套，使全车间三十一道工序道道都有了成套的经验。十分明显，当这些经验由点滴的、零散的变成成套的以后，它们的生命力就大大地增强了。每一项经验在总结、配套过程中，得到了选择和提高，配搭成套以后，先前零散的、孤立的经验就变成了环环相扣的整套经验，这就更大地提高了它的使用价值和作用。
    总结、配套和推广先进经验有两种方法。一种是认为总结、配套是提高的过程，只能由少数人来干。这是专家路线的方法，少慢差费的方法。另一种是发动群众，集思广益的群众路线方法，多快好省的方法。大中华橡胶厂创造的“赶集”的方式，就是一种群众路线的总结、配套、推广先进经验的方式。俗语说得好：“事非经过不知难”。经过实践的人，最了解每一件创造的价值。把广大的职工群众组织起来“赶集”，让他们自己来找经验，自己来配套，当场鉴定，当场比较，把最好的经验汇集在一起，这就保证了配得快、配得好，也正因为如此，就使配套工作超越了眼前新创造的范围，形成了“新老经验配”、“大小经验配”、“土洋经验配”和“厂内外经验配”。凡是最好的、最合适的就让它们配搭起来成套、成列。
    愿大家都来做总结、配套、推广的工作。愿大家都来努力，使技术革新和技术革命运动更深更广更快地发展下去。
