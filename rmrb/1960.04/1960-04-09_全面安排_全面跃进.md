Editorial Postscript:

    Under the guideline of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development, a new situation of overall leap forward has emerged in the rural areas across the country. Not only should the sown area of grain crops be expanded, but the planting area of economic crops such as cotton, vegetables, oilseeds, tobacco, hemp, and tea should also be increased. Moreover, the establishment of pig farms and livestock farms at all levels of the communes, the construction of reservoirs, the establishment of factories, and the construction of highways all require land. This is a contradiction. But this is the product of the excellent situation of "a hundred trees vying for spring, ten thousand boats racing," and the contradiction in the development and progress of things.

    How to resolve the contradiction? One way is to cut the feet to fit the shoes, reducing the sown area. This is not the thinking of striving for high standards of overall leap forward. The other way is to do everything possible to expand the sown area and ensure the completion of the sowing plan. This is the policy adopted by the vast majority of local party committees. The news from the Tongda People's Commune in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, published in this newspaper today is a very good example. We should, like the Tongda People's Commune, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes' "large size and high degree of public ownership," implement overall arrangements and rational layouts, and increase the planting of grain crops while expanding the planting area of economic crops.

### 全面安排　全面跃进

    全面安排　全面跃进
    在贯彻以粮为纲、全面发展的方针下，全国农村出现了全面跃进的新形势。粮食作物的播种面积既要扩大，棉花、蔬菜、油料、烟叶、麻、茶等经济作物的种植面积也要增加；而公社各级建立猪场和畜牧场，建设水库，办工厂，修公路等又都需要用地。这就是矛盾。但这是众木争春、万舟竞发的大好形势的产物，是事物在发展和前进中的矛盾。
    矛盾如何解决？一种是削足适履，缩小播种面积。这不是千方百计努力寻求高标准的全面跃进的思想。另一种是千方百计地扩大播种面积，保证完成播种计划。这是绝大多数的地方党委所采取的方针。今天本报发表的安徽省庐江县同大人民公社的消息就是一个很好的例证。我们应该像同大人民公社一样，充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，实行全面安排、合理布局，既增种粮食作物，又扩大经济作物的种植面积。
