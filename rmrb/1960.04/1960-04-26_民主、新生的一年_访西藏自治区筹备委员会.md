    A Year of Democracy and New Life
    --An Interview with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
    By Our Correspondent Ge Lai
    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been exercising the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet under the order of the State Council for a year.
    These days, Tibetan and Han cadres in charge of various departments, committees, offices, and sections of the Preparatory Committee are summarizing their work over the past year. When this reporter visited the Preparatory Committee, I saw Wang De (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Preparatory Committee, reporting to Panchen, the Acting Chairman, in his office. He talked about the achievements in the construction of political power in Tibet over the past year. Panchen listened carefully, nodding with satisfaction from time to time, and jotting down the key points of the report in his memorandum. Laming Yexi Chuchen and Chen Jingbo, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Preparatory Committee, were also present to listen to the report.
    After listening to the report, Panchen said: Since the Preparatory Committee exercised the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet for a year, Tibet's various tasks have seen great development and a great leap forward, achieving great accomplishments in politics, economy, culture and other fields. Panchen said: Chairman Mao said that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. In the past, the political power in Tibet was controlled by reactionary serf owners who carried out dark rule and cruel exploitation of the broad masses of working people. In the past eight or nine years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a small group of reactionaries in Tibet used the ruling machine of the former local government of Tibet to sabotage the Seventeen-Article Agreement and obstruct Tibet's construction in every possible way, making it difficult to carry out work beneficial to the people. Now, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercises the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet, and political power is in the hands of the people, making all work smooth and successful. He said: These many achievements have been made under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In the future, all tasks in Tibet must be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the policies of the Party, so that any work can move from victory to victory and achieve even greater success.
    Tibetan and Han cadres in the General Office of the Preparatory Committee were discussing the issue of issuing land ownership certificates in the democratic reform with cadres from various regions, while others were processing official documents. Duojie Caidan, Director of the General Office, introduced to the reporter the achievements made by the Preparatory Committee in exercising the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet over the past year. He said: The past year has been a year in which reactionary rule completely collapsed and the people began to be masters of their own affairs. During the year, every major issue of the Preparatory Committee was decided after careful study by Acting Chairman Panchen and Vice Chairmen Palbala and Apei under the leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC. The greatest achievements in this year were: the great victory in quelling the rebellion; the smooth progress of democratic reform; the establishment of political institutions; and the vigorous training of ethnic minority cadres. He said that there are now more than 500 ethnic minority cadres in the Preparatory Committee system, accounting for more than 90% of the entire staff. Due to the Party's emphasis on and training of cadres, many Tibetan cadres have made rapid progress and worked actively and diligently. In the past, many people had no work experience and were unfamiliar with their duties. After a year of training and education, most ethnic minority cadres can now work independently. In the General Office of the Preparatory Committee, there is a Tibetan secretary named Danjia. When he first came to the General Office, he was very unfamiliar with the work. After training and the constant help of Han cadres, he has now become the Deputy Chief of the Secretariat Section of the General Office.
    Jiangjin Wangqiu Jiebu, Deputy Director of the General Office, told the reporter that the Tibetan cadres of the Preparatory Committee all have responsibilities and power, and the leadership attaches great importance to the opinions of the Tibetan cadres. Everyone works happily and actively. He said that all ethnic minority cadres of the Preparatory Committee study professional skills and Han Chinese every Wednesday and Friday, and study Chairman Mao's works, ethnic minority policies, and the Tibetan version of "Red Flag" every Tuesday and Thursday to study current affairs. Everyone is very concerned about national affairs, and their political level has improved rapidly. Now everyone has only one goal and will: to resolutely follow the bright road of people's democracy and socialism under the leadership of the Party.
    In the office of the Civil Affairs Department, several Tibetan and Han cadres were jointly processing letters from farmers and herdsmen from various places. Many letters expressed enthusiastic support for the Preparatory Committee's resolutions on "three antis and two reductions" and "democratic reform."
    In the Counselor's Office of the Preparatory Committee, a large number of Tibetan books and documents are stored, and many Tibetan cultural figures work here. Some elderly people who are familiar with the history of Tibet are writing a new history of Tibet.
    In the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, many members and staff are sorting out Tibetan religious historical relics in preparation for establishing a religious relics museum. The patriotic Living Buddhas and Khenpos of the three major monasteries in Lhasa and other famous monasteries work here. The Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region has implemented the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, and appropriate arrangements have been made for upper-level patriotic lamas in terms of politics and life. After political study, these religious figures have improved their patriotic ideology.

    民主、新生的一年
    ——访西藏自治区筹备委员会
    本报记者　格来
    西藏自治区筹备委员会根据国务院命令行使西藏地方政府职权已经一年了。
    这些天，筹委会所属各厅、委、处、室的藏汉族负责干部，正在总结一年来的工作。记者访问自治区筹委会的时候，在代理主任委员班禅的办公室里，看到筹委会民政处副处长汪德（藏族）正向班禅汇报工作。他谈到了一年来西藏政权建设方面的成就。班禅仔细地听着汇报，时而满意地点着头，时而在备忘录上记下汇报的要点。筹委会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣、陈竞波也在场听取汇报。
    班禅听完汇报以后说：筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权一年来，西藏各项工作大发展、大跃进，在政治、经济、文化等各方面取得了很大的成就。班禅说：毛主席说过革命的根本问题是政权问题。过去西藏的政权都操纵在反动的大农奴主手里，对广大劳动人民进行黑暗的统治和残酷的剥削。过去西藏和平解放的八、九年中，西藏的一小撮反动分子，利用原西藏地方政府这个统治机器，破坏十七条协议，对西藏的各项建设工作进行百般阻挠，使有益于人民的工作很难进行。现在，西藏自治区筹委会行使着西藏地方政府的职权，政权掌握在人民的手里，样样工作得心应手，进行得很顺利。他说：这许多成就都是在党中央和毛主席的领导和关怀下取得的。今后西藏的各项工作，一定要按中央的指示和党的政策办事，这样任何工作才能从胜利走向胜利，获得更大的成就。
    在筹委会办公厅里的藏、汉族干部，有的在和各地前来的干部商谈在民主改革中颁发土地所有证的问题，有的在处理公文。办公厅主任多杰才旦向记者介绍了筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权一年来获得的成就。他说：过去的一年是反动统治彻底垮台、人民开始当家作主的一年。一年中，筹委会每项重大问题都是在中共西藏工委领导下，经过班禅代理主任委员和帕巴拉、阿沛副主任委员仔细研究后决定的。在这一年中取得的最大成绩是：平息叛乱的伟大胜利；民主改革的顺利进行；政权机构的建立；大力培养了民族干部。他说，现在筹委会系统有本民族干部五百多人，占整个工作人员的90％以上。由于党的重视和培养，很多藏族干部进步快、工作积极努力，过去很多人没有工作经验，不熟悉业务，经过一年的锻炼教育，现在绝大多数民族干部可以独立工作了。筹委会办公厅有个藏族秘书叫旦嘉，初到办公厅时工作很生疏，经过培养和汉族干部的经常帮助，现在他已经成了办公厅秘书科的副科长。
    办公厅副主任江金·汪秋杰布告诉记者，筹委会的藏族干部都有职有权，领导上很重视藏族干部的意见，大家工作得很愉快、很积极。他说，筹委会的全体民族干部，在每星期三和星期五学习业务和汉文汉语，星期二和星期四学习毛主席著作、民族政策和藏文版的“红旗”，研究时事，大家都很关心国家大事，政治水平提高得很快。现在大家的目标和意志只有一个：坚决在党的领导下走人民民主和社会主义的光明大道。
    在民政处办公室里几个藏、汉族干部正在共同处理各地农牧民的来信。许多来信对筹委会的关于“三反双减”、“民主改革”的各项决议表示热烈拥护。
    在筹委会参事室，存放着大批藏文书籍和文件，有很多藏族文化人士在这里工作。一些熟悉西藏历史的老年人正在编写新的西藏历史。
    在自治区筹委会的宗教事务委员会里，许多委员和工作人员，正在整理西藏宗教历史文物，准备建立宗教文物馆。在这里担任工作的有拉萨三大寺和其他著名寺院的爱国活佛和堪布。自治区筹委会贯彻执行了党的宗教信仰自由政策，对上层爱国喇嘛，在政治上和生活上都作了适当安排。这些宗教界人士经过政治学习，爱国主义思想都有所提高。
