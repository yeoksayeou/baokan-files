Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Beijing's universities and colleges are actively supporting the production and construction of rural people's communes by adopting measures such as "fixed-point tie-up, long-term collaboration."

    Ten institutions of higher learning, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, have recently established fixed cooperative relationships with eight rural people's communes in the Yongfeng, Haidian, and Sijiqing areas of suburban Beijing. Each school has sent responsible cadres and work teams to visit the communes to understand their needs. The Peking University Party Committee has decided to regularly have forty to fifty science students working in the Ming Tombs People's Commune to help carry out agricultural technical transformation. More than 3,300 teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College have successively gone down to rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing and various provinces and cities across the country to participate in the booming agricultural bumper harvest movement and agricultural technical transformation. Liberal arts and medical colleges have also established experimental sites and work sites to strengthen cooperation with rural people's communes.

    Teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University who went to the rural areas of suburban Beijing participated in livestock surveys focusing on pigs, as well as fertilizer surveys and soil surveys. More than 200 teachers and students who went to Daxing County, under the leadership of the county party committee, assumed technical work for high-yield command fields and joined the farmers in converting 200,000 mu of saline-alkali land for rice cultivation. More than 600 teachers and students from the Agricultural Mechanization College participated in the work of several agricultural mechanization experimental sites across the country. According to incomplete statistics, they have already successfully designed more than 180 kinds of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm implements, including rope single-line automatic remote control and animal-powered land levelers. These two agricultural colleges also undertook the task of training cadres and technicians for rural people's communes.

    北京各高等学校支援农业
    定点挂钩　长期协作
    据新华社讯　北京各高等学校采取“定点挂钩，长期协作”等措施，积极支援农村人民公社的生产建设。
    清华大学、北京大学等十所高等院校，最近和北京郊区永丰、海淀、四季青等八个农村人民公社建立了固定的协作关系。各校都派出负责干部和工作组访问公社，了解他们的需要。北京大学党委决定经常有四、五十名理科学生在十三陵人民公社劳动，帮助开展农业技术改造工作。北京农业大学和北京农业机械化学院师生三千三百多人，已陆续下放到北京市郊和全国各省市农村参加轰轰烈烈的农业丰产运动和农业技术改造。文科、医科高等院校也纷纷建立试验点、工作点加强了和农村人民公社的协作。
    北京农业大学下放京郊农村的师生参加了以猪为主的畜牧调查和肥料调查、土壤普查等工作；下放大兴县的师生二百余人在县委领导下，担任了丰产指挥田的技术工作，和农民一道投入了将二十万亩盐碱地改种水稻的工作。农业机械化学院六百多名师生参加了全国一些农业机械化试验点的工作，据不完全统计，已经设计成功一百八十多种机械化、半机械化农具，其中包括绳索单线自动遥远控制、畜力平地机等。这两所农业高等学校，还担任了训练农村人民公社干部和技术人员的任务。
