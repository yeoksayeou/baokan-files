Long Live the Great Solidarity of the Asian and African Peoples

The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has successfully concluded. In these days, representatives from Asian and African countries gathered in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea in Black Africa, to jointly discuss the major issues of strengthening the unity of the Asian and African peoples, thoroughly eradicating imperialism and colonialism, and striving for and safeguarding independence, freedom, and peace. This conference adopted a declaration, as well as a series of major resolutions on imperialism, unity and solidarity, coexistence and disarmament, nuclear weapons and nuclear tests, Algeria, South Africa, and on economic and cultural relations. The Chinese people, who have always upheld the cause of Asian-African solidarity and persisted in the struggle against imperialism, cheer for the glorious achievements of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

This conference was a grand gathering of Asian-African people's solidarity and a rally for Asian-African people to denounce imperialism and colonialism. The declaration of the conference solemnly proclaimed: "The existence of imperialism is incompatible with the state of the world." In the resolution on imperialism, the conference strongly condemned to the world the crimes committed by the imperialist countries, the shameless suppression and the racial massacres, and condemned the imperialist countries for using all means to oppose the national liberation movements of the Asian and African peoples. It also called on all Asian and African countries to "give unreserved moral and material support to the Asian and African peoples who are fighting for freedom and independence." In the resolution on unity and solidarity, the conference demanded that "all imperialist conspiracies be stopped immediately, military bases and military treaties be abolished, and all foreign imperialist troops and all imperialist military delegations be withdrawn from Asia and Africa."

At present, issuing a battle call to the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and colonialism is obviously of great significance. In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world against imperialism and colonialism have achieved great victories and are forcing imperialism to retreat step by step. At present, the colonial system is facing a total collapse, and one colony after another has broken the chains of imperialism. The population of the world directly under colonial rule has been sharply reduced from 700 million before the war to 140 million. However, it is precisely because the area where imperialism can arbitrarily exploit and plunder has become smaller and smaller that the suffering of the colonial people has become increasingly heavy. Moreover, the closer imperialism is to its demise, the more it will carry out a desperate struggle and a frenzied counterattack. As Liao Chengzhi, the head of the Chinese delegation, said: "Whether it is the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, or any other imperialism, they are nothing but paper tigers. However, the imperialists are diehards. They will take all means... to maintain their criminal rule and restore what they have already lost." Therefore, the Asian and African peoples deeply understand from their own experience that they must persevere and fight imperialism to the end in order to ultimately and completely eradicate all the scourges of imperialism and colonialism from the earth. In this decisive historical stage, any relaxation of vigilance against imperialism and colonialism, any weakening of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, is a violation of the common interests of the people of all countries in striving for and safeguarding national independence and world peace. Ismail Touré, Chairman of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and head of the Guinean delegation, rightly said: "We must always remember that the enemy of our great revival is still imperialism and all the political, economic, cultural, and ideological weapons used by imperialism, and the inevitable consequences of imperialist rule are ignorance, hunger, and disease. Faced with such an enemy, we will continue to fight until final victory and never stop halfway."

An important achievement of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was to give great importance and strong support to the African national liberation movement. The African national independence movement has now entered a new stage. To date, in Africa, nearly half of the countries accounting for the total population of the continent have gained independent status, and in 1960, a series of African countries with a population of nearly 60 million will gain independent status. In this way, the population of independent African countries this year will account for two-thirds of the total African population. This fact shows how tremendous changes have taken place in Africa, which has always been called the "Dark Continent," in a very short historical period. This change reflects the characteristics of our era. After the 20th century entered the 1960s, the African national independence movement is heading for a new upsurge. The Algerian people's national liberation war is being carried out victoriously; recently, the South African people have launched a vigorous struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights. The conference adopted resolutions respectively on supporting the struggles of the people of Algeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Angola, Ruanda-Urundi, Mauritania, and Ivory Coast. The conference once again called on Asian and African countries to support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle, believing that the Algerian people's struggle is a "symbol of the Asian and African people's selfless struggle for their own liberation." The Algerian people are now standing at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism. The victory of the Algerian people will not only greatly encourage the liberation movement of the African people, but also severely hit the imperialist war forces and greatly benefit the cause of the Asian, African, and world people in safeguarding peace.

For those Asian and African countries that have already gained political independence, the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference pointed out in the resolution on economic issues that achieving economic independence is their main task today. This resolution profoundly reflects the urgent aspirations of the Asian and African peoples and the in-depth development of the Asian-African national independence movement. After World War II, under pressure from the new situation of the Asian and African people's struggle against colonialism, imperialism had to make some concessions politically, but it still attempted to tightly control some emerging independent countries in all aspects, especially economically. In particular, American imperialism, in addition to carrying out political and military aggression against underdeveloped countries, its economic plunder, extortion, and exploitation is all-pervasive. This economic control has long become a typical form of American neo-colonialism. From 1950 to 1958 alone, the profits extracted by American monopoly capital from investments in underdeveloped countries reached more than 11.3 billion US dollars. Every dollar here is stained with the blood and sweat of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Obviously, due to the economic aggression of Asian and African countries by imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, Asian and African countries have been in a state of poverty and backwardness for a long time and cannot be independent and autonomous. The resolution of the conference correctly pointed out that only economic independence can enable Asian and African countries to successfully repel the imperialists' conspiracies.

Under the brilliant light of the "Bandung Spirit," the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has made significant contributions to Asian-African and world peace. In the resolutions on coexistence and disarmament and nuclear weapons, the conference strongly condemned the French imperialist nuclear weapons tests in Africa and called on the Asian and African people to further strengthen their unity to oppose the threat of nuclear weapons. The entire process of the conference and its resolutions show that the Asian and African peoples deeply understand that the principle of peaceful coexistence is incompatible with the imperialist policies of war and aggression and with the imperialist colonial rule. In order to safeguard peace and achieve peaceful coexistence, the most barbaric colonial rule must be ended. The Asian and African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism is bound to be closely linked with the struggle for peace and become an inseparable and important part of the struggle to defend world peace. As Guinean President Sékou Touré pointed out in his opening speech at this conference, "The causes of the world's unrest are racism and acts of aggression; it is selfishness; it is the forces of oppression and exploitation. We cannot but believe that our struggle against imperialism and colonialism is a decisive aspect of the world-wide struggle for peace."

The Asian and African people now increasingly recognize that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the greatest enemy of independence, freedom, and peace in Asian and African countries. Today, American imperialism in Asia not only continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, occupies the southern part of Korea, and carries out various anti-peace conspiracies in Indochina, but has recently intensified its collusion with the Japanese reactionaries, forming a new US-Japan military alliance, reviving Japanese militarism, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. In its resolution, this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference specifically condemned the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" and reminded the Asian and African people to pay attention to "the purpose of this treaty is to revive Japanese militarism and establish nuclear bases on Japanese soil, thereby threatening the peace and security of countries in Asia and the Pacific region." The conference resolution also condemned military blocs and military bases of imperialism threatening the independence, peace and security of Asian and African countries. Today, American imperialism, on the one hand, poses as the "world police" and supports the bloody suppression of colonies and semi-colonies by those old colonialists everywhere; on the other hand, it is stepping up its efforts to infiltrate Asia and Africa in all aspects. In the post-war period, American imperialism has carried out ambitious colonial expansion in Africa from all aspects of politics, military affairs, economy, and culture, which has become a serious threat to the African national independence movement. American imperialism has also carried out aggression against Latin American countries. The recent US interference in Cuba has aroused strong indignation from just public opinion around the world. American imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also the most ferocious enemy of world peace.

Faced with the arduous task of fighting against imperialism, the Asian and African people need to further strengthen their unity. The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has also made significant contributions to the cause of Asian-African people's solidarity. The conference pointed out in the resolution on unity and solidarity: "In the struggle against imperialism, the unity and solidarity of the Asian and African people occupies an extremely important and indispensable position." The resolution of the conference fully reflects the urgent need for mutual support, unity and cooperation among the Asian and African peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in the development of independent economic and national cultural undertakings. This common requirement of the Asian and African people has a solid foundation, because opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for and safeguarding national independence and world peace are our common program and the greatest interests of the Asian and African people. Although imperialism has tried its best to undermine the unity between the Asian and African people, the fact proves that this conspiracy of imperialism can only be shamefully defeated.

We firmly believe that under the encouragement of the resolutions of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, under the banner of opposing imperialism and colonialism, the Asian and African people will be more united, overcome all obstacles, and move from victory to greater victory. Long live the great solidarity of the Asian and African people!

    亚非人民大团结万岁
    第二届亚非人民团结大会胜利闭幕了。这些天里，来自亚非各国的代表们云集黑非洲几内亚共和国的首都科纳克里，共同商讨了亚非人民加强团结，彻底肃清帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护独立、自由与和平的大事。这届大会通过了一项宣言，通过了关于帝国主义、统一和团结、共处和裁军、核武器和核试验、阿尔及利亚、南非，以及关于经济、文化关系等的一系列重大决议。一贯维护亚非团结事业和坚持反对帝国主义斗争的中国人民，为第二届亚非人民团结大会的光辉成就而欢呼。
    这一次大会，是亚非人民大团结的盛会，也是亚非人民声讨帝国主义和殖民主义的大会。大会的宣言严正地宣告：“帝国主义的存在，同世界的现状是不相容的。”在关于帝国主义的决议中，大会向全世界强烈地谴责帝国主义国家所犯下的罪行、所进行的无耻镇压以及种族屠杀，谴责帝国主义国家用尽一切办法来反对亚非国家人民的民族解放运动。并且号召亚非所有国家“无保留地给予正在为自由和独立而斗争的亚非各国人民以道义上和物质上的支援。”在关于统一和团结的决议中，大会要求“立即制止帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，废除军事基地和军事条约，从亚洲和非洲撤出一切外国帝国主义的军队和一切帝国主义军事代表团。”
    在目前向亚非人民发出反对帝国主义和殖民主义的战斗号召，显然具有极重大的意义。在东风浩荡，西风日衰的形势下，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争已经取得了伟大的胜利，并正在迫使帝国主义步步退却。目前，殖民体系已面临全面崩溃，一个又一个殖民地相继挣断了帝国主义的锁链，全世界直接处于殖民统治下的人口已从战前的七亿锐减到一亿四千万了。但是，正是由于帝国主义可以随意剥削与掠夺的地区已愈来愈小，殖民地人民遭受的苦难也愈益沉重。而且，帝国主义越是频临绝境，它就越要进行垂死的挣扎和疯狂的反扑。正如中国代表团团长廖承志所说：“不管是美国、英国、法国、比利时、葡萄牙或是其它任何帝国主义，都不过是纸老虎。可是，帝国主义者是死硬派。他们将采取一切手段……保持他们的罪恶统治和恢复他们所已经失掉的东西。”因此，亚非人民从切身的体会中深深懂得，必须再接再厉，同帝国主义斗争到底，以求得最终地从地球上彻底肃清帝国主义和殖民主义的一切祸害。在这个具有决定意义的历史阶段，对帝国主义殖民主义的警惕性的任何放松，反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争的任何削弱，都是违反各国人民争取和维护民族独立和世界和平的共同利益的。第二届亚非人民团结大会主席、几内亚代表团团长伊斯梅尔·杜尔说得对：“必须时刻记住，我们的伟大的复兴的敌人，仍然是帝国主义以及帝国主义所使用的政治、经济、文化和思想方面的一切武器，而帝国主义统治给我们带来的不可避免的后果就是愚昧、饥饿和疾病。面对着这样的敌人，我们将继续斗争，直到最后胜利，决不中途收兵。”
    第二届亚非人民团结大会的一个重要的成就是，给予非洲民族解放运动以极大的重视和大力支持。非洲民族独立运动现在已进入了一个新的阶段。迄今为止，在非洲，已经有将近占整个大陆总人口一半的国家取得了独立地位，1960年又将有近六千万人口的一系列非洲国家取得独立地位。这样，今年非洲独立国家的人口将要占到全非人口的三分之二。这个事实表明：一向被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，在极短的历史时期内起了多么巨大的变化。这个变化反映了我们这个时代的特征。在二十世纪进入了六十年代以后，非洲民族独立运动正在走向新的高涨。阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争正在胜利地进行着；最近南非人民又掀起了反对种族歧视，争取基本人权的轰轰烈烈的斗争。大会分别就支持阿尔及利亚、南非、喀麦隆、安哥拉、卢安达—乌隆迪、毛里塔尼亚和象牙海岸等国人民的斗争作出决议。大会再一次号召亚非国家支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，认为阿尔及利亚人民的斗争是“亚非人民争取自己解放的奋不顾身的斗争的象征”。阿尔及利亚人民现正站在反对帝国主义斗争的最前哨。阿尔及利亚人民的胜利，不仅将给非洲人民的解放运动以极大的鼓舞，而且将沉重地打击帝国主义战争势力，大大有利于亚、非和全世界人民维护和平的事业。
    对于那些已经在政治上获得独立的亚非国家，第二届亚非人民团结大会在关于经济问题的决议中指出，实行经济独立是它们今天的主要任务。这个决议深刻地反映了亚非各国人民的迫切愿望和亚非民族独立运动的深入发展。第二次世界大战以后，帝国主义迫于亚非人民反对殖民主义斗争的新形势，不得不在政治上作了一些让步，但是仍然企图在各方面，尤其是经济上紧紧地控制亚非一些新兴的独立国家。特别是美国帝国主义，除了对不发达国家实行政治和军事侵略之外，在经济上的掠夺、榨取和剥削则是无孔不入的，这种经济控制早就成为美国新殖民主义的典型形式。仅仅从1950年到1958年，美国垄断资本对不发达国家的投资所榨取的利润达到一百十三亿多美元。这里每一块美元都染着亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民的血汗。很显然，由于美国、英国、法国等帝国主义国家对亚非各国的经济侵略，亚非国家在经济上长期处于贫困和落后状态，而不能独立自主。大会的决议正确地指出，只有经济独立才能使亚非国家成功地击退帝国主义者的阴谋。
    第二届亚非人民团结大会在“万隆精神”的光辉照耀下，对于亚非及世界和平作出了重大的贡献。大会在关于共处和裁军以及核武器问题的决议中强烈地谴责法国帝国主义在非洲进行的核武器试验，并要求亚非人民更进一步地加强团结来反对核武器的威胁。大会的整个进程和它的决议表明，亚非人民深深地懂得，和平共处的原则是同帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，同帝国主义的殖民统治水火不相容的。为了维护和平并实现和平共处，必须结束最野蛮的殖民统治。亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，必然同争取和平的斗争紧密地联系在一起，而成为保卫世界和平斗争中的不可分割的重要部分。正如几内亚总统塞古·杜尔在本届大会的开幕词中所指出，“使世界动荡不安的原因是种族主义和侵略主义的行为；是自私自利；是压迫和剥削的势力。我们不能不认为，我们反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是世界范围维护和平的斗争的一个决定性的方面”。
    亚非人民现在越来越认清，帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义，是亚非各国独立、自由与和平的最大的敌人。今天，美国帝国主义在亚洲不仅继续侵占着中国的领土台湾，占领着朝鲜南部，在印度支那进行形形色色的反和平阴谋，而且最近更变本加厉地同日本反动派勾结，结成新的美日军事同盟，复活日本军国主义，威胁远东和世界和平。这次亚非人民团结大会在决议中特别谴责了新的日美“安全条约”，并且提醒亚非人民注意：“这个条约的目的是要复活日本军国主义和在日本的土地上建立核基地，从而威胁亚洲和太平洋地区各国的和平和安全。”大会决议也谴责了帝国主义威胁亚非各国独立、和平与安全的军事集团和军事基地。今天，美国帝国主义一方面以“世界宪兵”自居，到处支持那些老牌殖民主义者对殖民地和半殖民地的血腥镇压；另一方面正开足马力，从各方面渗入亚洲、非洲。战后时期，美国帝国主义从政治、军事、经济、文化等各方面大举向非洲进行野心勃勃的殖民扩张，已经成为非洲民族独立运动的严重威胁。美国帝国主义还对拉丁美洲各国进行侵略。美国最近对古巴的干涉引起了全世界公正舆论的强烈愤慨。美国帝国主义不仅是亚、非、拉丁美洲人民最凶恶的敌人，而且是世界和平的最凶恶的敌人。
    面临着反对帝国主义斗争的艰巨的任务，亚非人民需要进一步加强团结。第二届亚非人民团结大会对亚非人民的团结事业也作出了重大贡献。大会在统一和团结的决议中指出：“在反对帝国主义的斗争中，亚非各国人民的统一和团结，占着极其重要的不可或缺的地位。”会议的决议，充分地反映了亚非各国人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中，在发展独立经济和民族文化事业中，迫切地需要互相支援、团结合作的要求。亚非人民的这一共同要求有着坚实的基础，因为反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立和世界和平，是我们共同的纲领，是亚非各国人民最大的利益所在。尽管帝国主义竭力企图破坏亚非各国人民之间的团结，但事实证明，帝国主义的这种阴谋，只能遭到可耻的失败。
    我们深信，在第二届亚非人民团结大会的决议鼓舞下，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的旗帜下，亚非人民将更加团结一致，冲破一切障碍，从胜利走向更大的胜利。亚非人民大团结万岁！
