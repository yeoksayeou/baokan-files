Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 31st. Hungary has achieved great success in the socialist transformation of agriculture and agricultural production in the fifteen years since its liberation. At present, the political and production enthusiasm of the working farmers is unprecedentedly high, and the whole country is striving to complete agricultural cooperation as soon as possible and rapidly improve agricultural production.

Socialist Agriculture Already Holds an Overwhelming Advantage: 74% of Villages and Towns Achieve Complete Cooperation

In Hungary's agricultural production, socialist economic components now hold an absolute advantage. As of the end of February this year, agricultural production cooperatives and state farms cultivated 72% of the country's total cultivated land, and 74% of villages and towns have completely achieved cooperation.

The Hungarian agricultural cooperation movement began to form a climax at the end of 1958. After the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party made a resolution on accelerating the socialist transformation of agriculture in December 1958, within a short period of three months, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives and the amount of land increased two times, and the proportion of cultivated land occupied by cooperatives and state farms in the total cultivated land of the country surged from 26.5% at the end of 1958 to 49%. Following this major development, from November 1959 to February this year, Hungary experienced a new climax of cooperation, thereby increasing the proportion of socialist components in the country's cultivated land area to 72%. This great victory further consolidated the people's regime and the worker-peasant alliance.

Thanks to the Active Support of the Whole Party and the Whole People: Cooperatives Generally Show Superiority

The Party and the government attach great importance to consolidating the newly established cooperatives politically and economically. Up to now, party organizations have been established in 80% of the cooperatives across the country, making the political leadership in rural areas a strong core. The central and local governments have transferred a large number of cadres and agricultural experts to work in the cooperatives for a long time. Employees of agricultural machinery manufacturing departments have also universally launched labor competitions to increase production and practice economy, vigorously supporting the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Thanks to the active support of the whole party and the whole people and the increase in the political awareness of the working farmers, the newly established societies have quickly been consolidated. In 1959, the unit area yield of grain in both old and new societies greatly exceeded that of individual farmers, demonstrating the superiority of socialist large-scale management.

The Degree of Mechanization Has Been Rapidly Improved: Agricultural Production Has Increased by About 43% in the Last Ten Years

Since liberation, especially with the great development of the cooperative movement in the past year or so, the degree of agricultural mechanization has been rapidly improved. Great progress has also been made in farmland water conservancy. At present, the cultivation of farmland in the country has been basically mechanized, and the sowing and harvesting of grains are also mostly done by machines. The average amount of chemical fertilizer used per hectare is more than 80 kilograms, which is more than five times higher than in 1938 before liberation. At present, the irrigated area in the country is equivalent to more than six times that before liberation.

Thanks to a series of positive measures, the total agricultural output value has increased by about 43% in the past ten years, and the unit area yield of crops has increased year by year. From 1957 to 1959, the average yield of wheat per hectare was more than 120 kilograms higher than the average yield from 1931 to 1944.

Livestock Production Has Developed Very Rapidly: The National Average Is Eight Pigs for Every Ten People

Hungary's animal husbandry suffered severe damage during World War II, with the country losing more than 65% of its livestock. But by 1950, animal husbandry had surpassed pre-war levels. Due to the rapid development of animal husbandry, animal husbandry production accounted for 42.2% of the total agricultural production value in 1959. As of last autumn, this country with a population of less than 10 million already had 8 million pigs, 2 million cattle, 2.2 million sheep, 720,000 horses, and more than 100 million poultry. Compared with 1945, the number of pigs has increased sevenfold, cattle has doubled, sheep has increased sixfold, and horses has increased one and a half times; while poultry has increased more than threefold in the last three years alone.

The Targets Set in the Second Five-Year Plan: Show a Brilliant Prospect for Agriculture in the Future

The Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) adopted by the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party shows a brilliant prospect for Hungarian agriculture. This plan stipulates that the socialist transformation of agriculture should be completed in the next few years; the average agricultural output from 1961 to 1965 will increase by 30%-32% compared with the average output from 1954 to 1958, and edible livestock will increase by 30%-33%. In addition, this plan also puts forward inspiring targets in agricultural mechanization, fertilization, and water conservancy irrigation. Now, all Hungarian agricultural laborers are working hard with confidence to complete these targets.

### 党和政府加强领导　农民觉悟迅速提高  匈农业合作化和农业生产双丰收

    党和政府加强领导　农民觉悟迅速提高
    匈农业合作化和农业生产双丰收
    新华社布达佩斯31日电　匈牙利解放十五年来，在农业社会主义改造和农业生产方面都取得了巨大的成就。目前劳动农民的政治和生产热情空前高涨，全国正在为尽快完成农业合作化和迅速提高农业生产而奋斗。
    社会主义农业已占压倒优势  74％的村镇实现完全合作化
    在匈牙利农业生产中，目前社会主义经济成份已占绝对优势。到今年2月底为止，农业生产合作社和国营农场所耕种的土地已占全国总耕地面积的72％，有74％的村镇已完全实现了合作化。
    匈牙利农业合作化运动是在1958年底开始形成高潮的。在1958年12月社会主义工人党中央做出关于加速农业社会主义改造的决议后，在短短的三个月内，入社的农户和土地都增加了两倍，合作社和国营农场的耕地在全国耕地总面积中所占的比重，从1958年底的26.5％激增到了49％。继这次大发展之后，从1959年11月到今年2月，匈牙利又出现了合作化的新高潮，从而使社会主义成分在全国耕地面积中的比重提高到72％。这一伟大胜利进一步巩固了人民政权和工农联盟。
    由于全党全民的积极支持  合作社普遍显示了优越性
    党和政府十分重视从政治上和经济上巩固新成立的合作社。到现在为止，全国80％的合作社已建立了党组织，使农村的政治领导有了坚强的核心。中央和各地抽调了大批干部和农业专家到合作社去长期工作。农业机器制造部门的职工还普遍展开增加生产、实行节约的劳动竞赛，大力支持农业的社会主义改造。
    由于全党全民的积极支持和劳动农民政治觉悟的提高，新成立的社很快便得到了巩固。1959年老社和新社的谷物单位面积产量都大大超过了个体农民，显示出了社会主义大规模经营的优越性。
    机械化程度有了迅速提高  十年来农业增产43％左右
    解放以来，特别是随着一年多来合作化运动的大发展，农业机械化程度有了迅速的提高。农田水利工作也有了巨大的发展。目前全国的耕地工作已基本上机械化，谷物的播种和收割工作也大部分是利用机器进行的。平均每霍尔特化学肥料的使用量达八十多公斤，比解放前1938年增加了五倍多。目前全国灌溉面积相当于解放前的六倍以上。
    由于采取了一系列的积极措施，最近十年来农业总产值增长了43％左右，农作物的单位面积产量年年都有提高。1957—1959年，每霍尔特小麦的平均产量比1931—1944年的平均产量提高一百二十多公斤。
    畜牧业生产发展十分迅速  全国平均每十人有八头猪
    匈牙利的畜牧业在第二次世界大战中曾遭到严重的破坏，全国损失了65％以上的牲畜。但到1950年，畜牧业就已超过了战前的水平。由于畜牧业的迅速发展，1959年畜牧业生产已占农业生产总值的42.2％。到去年秋天为止，这个不到一千万人口的国家已拥有八百万头猪、二百万头牛、二百二十万头羊、七十二万匹马和一亿多只家禽。和1945年相比，猪的头数增加了七倍，牛增加了一倍，羊增加了六倍，马增加了一倍半；而家禽仅在最近三年就增加了三倍多。
    第二个五年计划规定的指标  为今后农业展示了光辉前景
    社会主义工人党第七次代表大会所通过的第二个五年计划（1961—1965年），为匈牙利农业展示了光辉的前景。这个计划规定，要在今后几年内结束农业的社会主义改造；1961—1965年的农业平均产量将比1954—1958年的平均产量增长30％—32％，食用牲畜增长30％—33％。此外，这个计划还在农业机械化、施肥和水利灌溉等方面提出了振奋人心的指标。现在，全体匈牙利农业劳动者正在满怀信心地为完成这些指标而努力。
