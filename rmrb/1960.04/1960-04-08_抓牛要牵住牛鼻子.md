To Catch a Cow, Grab the Bull's Nose
Chen Wenliang, Worker at Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant

　　No matter what work you do, it's impossible for everything to go smoothly; there will always be problems of one kind or another. These problems are contradictions, and if they are not resolved, they will affect the smooth progress of the work. Our group was newly established in 1958, and most of the members were new apprentices. At that time, the political atmosphere wasn't strong, there was a lack of unity among us, accidents were frequent, attendance rates were declining day by day, and the reject rate was increasing. In this situation, we didn't know what to do, so we resorted to treating the head when it hurt and the foot when it ached. This made it so I couldn't eat well or sleep soundly, but the problems still couldn't be solved. We didn't complete the group's plan for two months. After studying Chairman Mao's work "On Contradiction," I understood that there are contradictions in everything, and only by facing contradictions and resolving them can we promote the development of things. Exposing contradictions is a good thing, because contradictions exist objectively; even if you don't talk about them, they still exist objectively. The problems in our group didn't cease to exist just because we didn't talk about them; on the contrary, because we didn't talk about them in the past, the problems became even more serious. Why was the group's production not going well? Because in the past we didn't recognize the contradictions, so we couldn't talk about grasping the main contradiction. After studying "On Contradiction," I understood that in the development process of complex things, there are usually many contradictions, one of which is the main contradiction, and its existence and development affects the existence and development of other contradictions. Grasp the main contradiction, solve the main contradiction, and other contradictions can be easily resolved. It's like catching a cow; you have to grab the bull's nose, which is the key. Grabbing the cow's head or tail won't work. The problems in our group also had to be approached in this way, and we couldn't grasp everything at once. We held meetings for three days and raised many problems. Some said: the group leader's planning is poor, and he doesn't have a clear idea of what he's doing; some said: the master's attitude is bad; some said: there are not enough sandboxes and tools, and the task cannot be completed; a young worker said: the group's bonus assessment is unreasonable and requested a transfer… In short, many problems were exposed, but which problem was the main contradiction? We ranked the problems. Of course, the fact that sandboxes and tools weren't keeping up with production needs should be resolved. Problems such as the master's bad attitude and the group leader's poor planning could be easily resolved through group life meetings, and they had already been resolved. But what about the problem of that young worker? He was afraid of hard work, his work wasn't outstanding, he didn't want to work in the factory, and he still wanted to get bonuses, and this kind of thinking had an effect on a few people and resonated with them. Everyone believed that this problem must be solved first in order to reverse the group's work; this was a contradiction between backward thinking and advanced thinking. Therefore, at the group meeting, a struggle between two kinds of thinking was launched. Everyone analyzed and helped that young worker's thinking, listed his wrong words and deeds, and unanimously believed that this was bourgeois individualism thinking, which must be discarded in order to do a good job. After a careful process of reasoning and struggle, the young worker's thinking was straightened out. He felt that everyone's help was kind and he was educated. He expressed that he would overcome his shortcomings and work hard. The group meeting not only educated him but also educated everyone, especially those who were influenced by him, who also took the initiative to examine themselves and expressed their determination. As a result, the main contradiction was resolved, and the group's work immediately took on a new aspect. In the past, sixty people had one hundred and twenty minds, but now they only had one mind. Everyone scrambled to do work, and in that month 80% of the people achieved high output, with some completing more than two thousand hours of work in a day. That young worker also came early and left late, and established the idea of caring about planning. In the past, tasks couldn't be assigned, but now he took the initiative to ask the group leader for work. The whole group chased after each other, competed with each other, and united closely. The production task changed from completing 70% of the plan in the past two months to completing 125% in one month. A new situation emerged where everyone was happy and everyone was full of energy.

　　The reason why our group was able to transform from failing to complete tasks in the past to exceeding the completion of tasks is the result of studying Chairman Mao's works under the leadership of the Party and applying them to actual work. After studying "On Contradiction," we understood the universality and particularity of contradictions, grasped the main contradiction, and resolved the contradiction, thereby promoting production. This incident fully proves the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is a compass to guide us in doing all our work well.

    抓牛要牵住牛鼻子
    沈阳第三机床厂工人　陈文亮
    不管做什么工作，不可能都是顺顺当当的，总会有这样或那样的问题。这些问题，就是矛盾，如果不加以解决，就会影响工作的顺利进行。我们小组是1958年新成立的，组里大部分是新徒工，当时政治空气不浓，互相间不团结，事故多，出勤率一天一天降低，废品率却往上长。在这种情况下，不知干啥是好，只好头疼医头，脚疼医脚，弄得我饭也吃不好，觉也睡不稳，可问题还是解决不了，两个月没完成小组计划。学习了毛主席著作“矛盾论”，懂得了一切事物里都有矛盾，只有正视矛盾，解决矛盾，才能推动事物向前发展。暴露矛盾，是一件好事，因为矛盾是客观存在的，你不讲它，它也是客观存在的。我们小组的问题，并不因为我们不讲就不存在；恰恰相反，由于我们过去不讲，问题就发展得愈加严重起来。为什么小组生产搞不好？因为过去没有认识到矛盾，也就谈不上抓主要矛盾了。学习“矛盾论”以后，知道在复杂的事物的发展过程中，通常有很多矛盾，其中有一个是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。抓住主要矛盾，解决主要矛盾，其他矛盾就可以迎刃而解了。就像抓牛一样，要牵牛鼻子，这是关键所在，抓牛头、牛尾都不行。我们小组的问题也得这样，不能头发胡子一把抓。我们开了三天会，提出了很多问题，有的说：组长计划性差，心中没数；有的说：师傅态度不好；有的说：砂箱工具不足，不能完成任务；有个青工说：小组评奖不合理，要求调动工作……总之，问题暴露出来不少，而究竟哪个问题是主要矛盾呢？我们把问题排了排队。当然，砂箱工具跟不上生产需要，这是应该解决的；师傅态度不好，组长计划性差等问题，通过小组生活会，这些问题都好解决，并且已经解决了。但是，那个青工的问题怎么办呢？他干活怕累，工作不出色，不愿在厂子干，还想得奖金，而且他的这种思想在少数人中起了作用，发生了共鸣。大家认为必须首先解决这个问题，才能扭转小组的工作，这是落后思想和先进思想之间的矛盾。于是，在小组会上，展开了两种思想的斗争。大家对那个青工的思想进行了分析、帮助，列举了他的错误言行，一致认为这是资产阶级个人主义思想，必须把它抛弃，才能搞好工作。经过细致的说理斗争，这个青工的思想搞通了，他感到大家的帮助亲切，受到了教育，表示要克服缺点，好好干工作。通过小组会，不仅教育了他自己，也教育了大家，特别是受他影响的那几个人，也主动检查，表示决心。这一来，主要矛盾解决了，小组工作立刻出现了新局面。过去六十个人有一百二十条心，如今只有一条心。大家抢活干，当月有80％的人做到高产，有的一天完成二千多小时的工作量。那个青工也早来晚走，树立了关心计划的思想，过去任务下不去，现在主动跟组长要工作。全组的人你追我赶，互相比武较劲，亲密团结，生产任务由过去两个月完成计划70％，一变而为一月完成125％，出现了人人心情舒畅，个个干劲倍增的崭新局面。
    我们小组所以能够由过去完不成任务转变为超额完成任务，这是在党的领导下，通过学习毛主席著作，并且把它运用到实际工作中的结果。学习了“矛盾论”，懂得了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性，抓住了主要矛盾，解决了矛盾，从而推动了生产。通过这件事，充分地证明毛主席著作的光辉伟大，毛泽东思想是指导我们做好一切工作的指南针。
