Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch from Cape Town: Regardless of the strong protests from the South African people and world opinion against the South African police's massacre of Africans, the South African Federal Government announced a "state of emergency" in eighty administrative districts (out of approximately three hundred in South Africa) on the morning of the 30th. It also announced the mobilization of a portion of the so-called "South African Citizen Force," composed of colonists, to further suppress the South African Africans who are fighting for democratic rights.

It is reported that before declaring the "state of emergency," the South African authorities began large-scale arrests of leaders of African nationalist organizations and other mass groups throughout the country. According to official announcements, more than two hundred people were arrested in the morning of the 30th alone, including Albert Luthuli, President of the African National Congress of South Africa, Nokwe, the Secretary-General, Leon Levy, Chairman of the South African Trade Union Congress, and Mrs. Helen Joseph, Chairman of the South African Women's Federation.

The large-scale arrests by the South African authorities aroused even greater anger among the South African people. On the same day, in Cape Town, about 30,000 Africans from nearby towns, ignoring the authorities' ban, marched in a column one mile long to the center of Cape Town to protest the South African authorities' mass arrests. The demonstrators sang songs and chanted slogans such as "Africa" and "Our Motherland."

Approximately 15,000 demonstrators surrounded the South African Federal Parliament, which was in session. The parliament doors were tightly closed, and armored vehicles and a large number of armed police were on guard around the perimeter. Armed police were also stationed in the parliament's open spaces and basements. Another 15,000 demonstrators, defying intimidation by aircraft sent by the authorities, marched hand-in-hand towards the heavily guarded police headquarters.

In Wattrouf, an African residential area ten miles east of Cape Town, a demonstration also broke out in the afternoon. The marching crowd bravely broke through the police cordon towards West Somerset despite being beaten with batons. Police opened fire while suppressing the demonstrators. In Stellenbosch, a town forty miles northeast of Cape Town, a large group of Africans from nearby areas demonstrated and prepared to enter the town to return the criminal "passes" to the local court. Police beat these demonstrators with batons.

It is reported that the African people's strikes are still unfolding in various places. On the Cape Peninsula, the strike of 50,000 African workers has entered its third day. In other areas, many Africans continue to refuse to work. Sources say that in the Cape Town area, several thousand people of color did not go to work today to show solidarity with the African people's struggle.

The U.S. representative, Lodge, who served as the President of the Security Council in March, spoke next. Although Lodge expressed agreement in including the issue on the agenda, he made no mention of whether the United States supported taking action against the South African government.

The representative of the South African Federation tried his best to whitewash the South African government's criminal actions. He blamed the bloody suppression of unarmed African residents on the participants in the peaceful demonstrations and expressed unparalleled hatred for the South African natives who protested the government's brutal policies. The South African Federation representative withdrew from the meeting after his speech.

The Tunisian representative, Slim, accused the South African government of stubbornly pursuing a policy of racial discrimination and accused the South African government of reducing 12 million African residents to the status of prisoners. Slim demanded that the Security Council take truly effective decisions to end this situation in South Africa.

The first speaker at the afternoon meeting, the representative of Ceylon, Claude Corea, condemned the racial discrimination policy of the South African Federal Government. Corea demanded that the Security Council take effective measures to force the South African Federal Government to change this policy.

The representatives of India, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Liberia vehemently condemned the apartheid policy of the South African Federal Government in their speeches. They pointed out that this policy violated the United Nations Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights and caused the massacre of peaceful demonstrators.

These representatives also refuted the claim that discussing this issue in the Security Council constitutes interference in internal affairs.

The Indian representative, Jha, said that the events that occurred in South Africa, in terms of their nature, causes, and consequences, have far exceeded the scope of South Africa's internal affairs and have become a matter of deep concern to the United Nations and the entire world.

The Ethiopian representative, Gebre-Heywet, said that the massacre that occurred in South Africa has special significance for the people of Ethiopia, recalling the tragic massacre of 30,000 Ethiopians in Addis Ababa by the fascist authorities in 1937.

Gebre-Heywet expressed his support for the proposals of other representatives calling for the Security Council to take resolute measures to end the current state of affairs in the South African Federation.

The Liberian representative condemned the South African Federal Government's actions as barbaric and demanded that the United Nations take immediate and decisive action without hesitation.

    南非人民斗争怒火愈燃愈烈
    开普敦三万非洲人举行示威　各地罢工斗争在坚持扩大中
    联邦当局宣布实行“紧急状态”大肆逮捕迫害坚决争取民主权利的非洲人
    新华社31日讯　开普敦消息：不顾南非人民和世界舆论对南非警察屠杀非洲人的暴行的强烈抗议，南非联邦政府30日上午在八十个行政区（南非共约三百个行政区）宣布“紧急状态”，并且宣布动员一部分由殖民者组成的所谓“南非公民军”，以进一步镇压争取民主权利的南非非洲人。
    据报道，南非当局在宣布“紧急状态”之前，就开始在全国各地大规模逮捕非洲民族主义组织和其他群众团体的领袖。据官方宣布，仅30日早晨的搜捕中就逮捕了二百多人，其中包括南非非洲人国民大会主席卢图利、秘书长诺克韦，南非工会大会主席累昂·李维和南非妇女联合会主席海伦·约瑟夫夫人。
    南非当局的大逮捕引起了南非人民更大的愤怒。当天，在开普敦城，来自附近各市镇的约三万名非洲人，不顾当局禁令，排成长达一英里的纵队，浩浩荡荡地开到开普敦市中心，抗议南非当局大逮捕的行动。示威者唱着歌并高呼“非洲”和“我们的祖国”等口号。
    约一万五千名示威者包围了正在开会的南非联邦议会。当时议会大门紧闭，装甲车和大量武装警察在周围警戒着；在议会的空地上和地下室内也都布满了武装警察。另外一万五千名示威者，不顾当局派飞机恫吓，手挽手地向戒备森严的警察总局前进。
    下午，在开普敦以东十英里的非洲人居住区瓦特鲁夫也爆发了示威游行，游行队伍不顾警棍的殴打，英勇地突破了警察的封锁线向西萨默塞特城内进发。警察在镇压示威者时开了枪。在开普敦东北四十英里的斯特伦博希镇，一大群从附近地区来的非洲人举行示威，并准备进镇去把罪恶的“通行证”退还给当地法院，警察用警棍殴打这些示威者。
    据报道，非洲人的罢工斗争仍在各地展开着。在开普半岛，五万名非洲工人的罢工已进入了第三天。其他地区，许多非洲人仍拒绝上工。有消息说，在开普敦地区，数千名有色人今天没有上工，表示声援非洲人的斗争。
    担任安全理事会3月份主席的美国代表洛奇接着发言。洛奇虽然表示同意把这个问题列入议程，但是他却只字没提美国是否赞成对南非政府采取行动。
    南非联邦代表竭力粉饰南非政府的罪恶行动。他把南非政府对手无寸铁的非洲居民的血腥镇压推罪于举行和平示威游行的参加者，并且对抗议政府的残暴政策的南非土著居民表示无比的仇视。南非联邦代表在讲话之后退出了会场。
    突尼斯代表斯陵指责南非政府顽固地推行种族歧视政策，并且指责南非政府把一千二百万非洲居民降到囚犯的地位。斯陵要求安全理事会采取真正有效的决定来结束南非这个局面。
    下午会议上第一个发言的锡兰代表克劳德·科里亚谴责南非联邦政府的种族歧视政策。科里亚要求安全理事会采取有效措施来迫使南非联邦政府改变这种政策。
    印度、埃塞俄比亚、巴基斯坦和利比里亚的代表在发言中猛烈谴责南非联邦政府的种族隔离政策，他们指出，这种政策违反联合国宪章和人权宣言，并且造成了这次屠杀和平示威者事件。
    这些代表还驳斥了所谓安全理事会讨论这个问题就是干涉内政的这种说法。
    印度代表杰哈说，在南非发生的事件，就它们的性质、原因和结果来说，都已经远远地越出了南非内政的范围，它们已经成为联合国和全世界深深关切的问题。
    埃塞俄比亚代表杰柏西说，在南非发生的屠杀对埃塞俄比亚人民有特殊的意义，这使他们回忆起1937年法西斯当局在阿的斯亚贝巴屠杀三万埃塞俄比亚人的惨案。
    杰柏西表示支持其他代表要求安理会采取坚决措施以结束南非联邦目前存在的状态的主张。
    利比里亚代表指责南非联邦政府的行为是野蛮的行为，他要求联合国立即和毫不迟疑地采取有力的行动。
