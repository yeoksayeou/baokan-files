    "Immortal Lai"
    Xiao Ling
    After the Bailin Commune in Fuding County, Fujian Province, developed the Wanbao Mountain, Comrade Lai Jinshi, the "chief engineer" responsible for designing this 10,000-mu new-style tea garden, was called "Immortal Lai" by the commune members. This legendary figure in the hearts of the mountain people was originally just an ordinary farmer.
    Comrade Lai Jinshi is the son of a poor peasant and a Communist Party member. His father starved to death in 1929, and his mother was a Red traffic officer. Because of the large family, they had to send him to the Lai family as an adopted son. This child, who grew up in the bitter waters of the old society, participated in the construction of the Yingxia Railway in 1958 and later returned home. At this time, he thought every day: What can I do for the commune now? Early spring, the commune began to develop Wanbao Mountain, and Secretary Lin of the Party Committee sent someone to call him up the mountain. He jumped out of bed, picked up a mountain hoe, and ran up the mountain. When he met Secretary Lin, he shook the mountain hoe in his hand and said, "Look, my partner and I have reported for duty." Secretary Lin patted him on the shoulder and said, "Wrong, buddy. Didn't you come back from the Yingxia Railway? We can't find a technician in the mountains now, and the Party has decided to make you the 'chief engineer' of the mountain development, responsible for the overall situation."
    He was stunned for a moment: "Can I do it?"
    Secretary Lin held his hand solemnly and said:
    "If the Party says you can do it, you can do it."
    He gritted his teeth and said, "If the Party wants me to do it, I will go through fire and water. If I don't subdue the difficulties, I won't be a good hero in the mountains who can capture dragons and subdue tigers." He waved in the air with his usual gesture, as if all the stubborn rocks and bad stones were crushed to pieces in his hands....
    The next day, he went up the mountain. Everyone was full of energy, and he was happy, but he also thought: This opened intermittent land, one piece in the east, one piece in the west, one high, one low, not only wastes labor, but what about future mechanized farming? He heard the voice of the Party in his ear: "We must think about tomorrow when we open up wasteland now...."
    That night, he couldn't sleep, staring at the ceiling with wide eyes. Oh! Cuixiao Brigade used to open new-style tea gardens, how did they do it? He ran five miles in the dark and knocked on the door in the middle of the night to discuss with the Cuixiao Brigade leader. But it didn't work! They mostly opened new-style tea gardens on flat ground. How can this experience work for opening tea gardens in the mountains? In the second half of the night, he took a bamboo pole and went to the state-owned Wengjiang Tea Farm to compare. If people planted a row of tea every five feet, he would draw a black line on the bamboo pole; if they planted two rows of tea every nine feet, he would draw a red line on the bamboo pole. He was secretly comparing and measuring, because he thought: This tea garden was designed by experts. I have no education and no surveying instruments. If I openly ask for advice, I won't be able to do anything.
    The next day, he went up the mountain excitedly. More than two thousand commune members opened the mountain slopes according to the black and red lines on his bamboo pole. Strange! It was clearly measured to be five feet wide, but in the end, there were only three feet left; the nine-foot wide land was only seven feet left, and it could never be implemented.
    The spring was cold, and the night was long. He tossed and turned for half the night before falling asleep.
    Early in the morning, he came to the Party Committee with a heavy heart.
    After Secretary Jian asked about the situation, he smiled and said, "Have you calculated the slope of the mountain? The hypotenuse of the slope is longer than the vertical side!"
    He was stumped. He couldn't even finish his breakfast before going up the mountain. This time, he connected with more than fifty old farmers and young people who had built railways and held a "Mountain Technology Research Meeting" for most of the day. Finally, the common conclusion was: "The hypotenuse is virtual, and the vertical side is real. The ruler measurement of the hypotenuse must be longer than the vertical side according to the slope of each mountain."
    The commune members opened the mountain according to this method, and it was implemented. Five feet was five feet, and nine feet was nine feet. He smiled now.
    The problem in front of him was not that simple. According to the normal measurement, it would take a month. However, the spring sowing was about to begin, and the Party Committee's schedule only had one month for surveying and opening the mountain. He thought: I can save time, but what about the surveyor's level? What about the measuring rod?…
    From that day on, his 50-person "Technology Research Committee" held two or three meetings a day, sometimes even until the middle of the night. Without a level, they used hand measurement and visual measurement instead; without a measuring rod, they used bamboo poles; without a tape measure, they used knotted straw ropes instead. After surveying a mountain, he would insert a small bamboo pole as a marker, and the mountain opening team would open the land along the direction indicated by the bamboo pole. After surveying, they first used hoes to scrape off the grass on the line, drew the initial model, and then mobilized everyone to discuss and determine the line. Although it was very tiring, it was still possible—they gained time and saved the commune a batch of instrument expenses.
    He did everything he could think of, but there were still many things he couldn't think of for this 10,000-mu high-standard tea garden. After three days of heavy snow, there was another heavy rain, and the mountains were full of mud. The commune members opening the mountain fell like mud men. Ah, water! How to control it? As he thought, he "plumped" and fell into a pit. Oh! There is a way, there is a way, he climbed up and immediately mobilized the commune members to work: open a ditch next to each garden land, dig a deep water pit in each ridge, the water will return to the ditch and will not run all over the mountain, it will fall into the deep water ridge one ridge at a time, slowing down the flow rate, which can greatly control soil erosion, both to nourish the mountain and to store water for drought resistance. At this time, the county party committee organized the first secretaries of communes from all over the county to visit and gave him many valuable suggestions, such as how to make the garden plots accessible to vehicles, how to make the roads suitable for future tractor farming, etc., which made him smarter day by day....
    In those days, he couldn't care about anything, his heart was only filled with one mountain after another. He looked up, and the barren mountains became more and more beautiful day by day: the large and small mountains within dozens of miles were as flat as mirrors, stacked layer upon layer into the sky; the ridges were as straight as lines, and a split ridge could be used as a ruler; the ditches were as dense as a net, like a long dragon winding around the mountain; the roads were wide and flat, and the "iron ox" could turn around on the mountain. Looking at this 10,000-mu high-standard tea garden, he exhaled a long breath and smiled. For this beautiful blueprint, although he and his partners in the "Technology Research Group" had taken many detours and endured many sleepless nights in the past month, they had not let down the trust of the Party and the masses!
    Now, Comrade Lai Jinshi has become the deputy director of the commune, and he is also responsible for managing this 10,000-mu tea garden. The Party and the masses have given him greater trust and honor. He replied: "I will definitely manage it better with everyone."

    “赖半仙”
    肖玲
    福建福鼎县白琳公社开发万宝山后，负责设计这万亩新式茶园的“总工程师”赖金石同志，被社员们称为“赖半仙”。这个山里人心中的传奇人物，原来只是一个平平常常的种田人。
    赖金石同志是一个贫农的儿子，共产党员。父亲在民国十八年时饿死，母亲是当年的红色交通员。因为家口多，只得把他送给赖家当养子。这个在旧社会的苦水里浸大的孩子，1958年参加鹰厦线铁路的建设，以后回到家里。这时他日日在想：现在我能为公社办点什么事呢？春头天，公社开始开发万宝山了，党委会林书记派人叫他上山。他呼地从床上跳起来，拿起一把山锄往山上跑。碰到林书记，他抖了一下手中的山锄说：“你看，我和我的伙伴来报到了。”林书记拍了一下他的肩膀说：“错了，伙计。你不是从鹰厦线上回来的吗？咱山里现在找不到一个技术员，党决定由你当开山‘总工程师’，负责全盘。”
    他楞了一下：“我能行吗？”
    林书记握着他的手严肃地说：
  “党说你行你就能行。”
    他咬了咬牙说：“党要我干，我刀山火海也要上。困难，我不治服它，就不算咱山里擒龙伏虎的好汉。”他用惯常的手势在空中一挥，仿佛那顽山恶石全在他手中捏得粉碎……。
    第二天，他上山了。大家干劲冲天，他心里也乐得开花，但是他又想：这开的插花地，东一块，西一块，高一坪，低一坪，不但花工，将来机耕时怎么办？他耳边响起了党的声音：“我们现在开荒，就要想到明天……”。
    这一夜，他睡不着，瞪着老大的眼睛望着天花板。哦！翠效大队过去开的是新式茶园，他们咋个开法呢？他摸黑跑了五里路，半夜敲门找翠效大队长商量起来。可是不行！人家开的大部是平地的新式茶园，大山开茶园，这个经验怎么行得通？下半夜他带上一条竹竿又到国营翁江茶场去比样子，人家五尺栽一行茶的，他就在竹竿上划一道黑线，九尺栽两行茶的，就在竹竿上画一道红线。他是偷偷地在比着量的，因为他想：这茶园是专家们设计的，我一没文化，二没勘察仪器，如果明着去请教，我什么也办不成。
    第二天，他兴冲冲地上山了。两千多个社员按着他竹竿上的黑道红道，比了比山坡开下去了。奇怪！明明量了五尺宽的园坪，最后只剩下三尺，九尺宽的园坪，也只剩下七尺，老是不能落实。
    春寒夜长，他折腾了半夜才睡下。
    大清早，他心事重重地来到党委会。
    简书记问了一些情况后，笑着说：“你计算过山地的坡度没有？坡面的斜边是要比直边长呀！”
    他被问住了。他顾不得吃完早饭就上了山。这一次他串连了五十多个老农，和筑过铁路的青年，开了大半天的“山地技术研究会”。最后大家共同的结论是：“斜边是虚，直边是实，斜边量的尺量，一定要按各个山头的坡度，长于直边。”
    社员们按照这个方法开下去，落实了，五尺就是五尺，九尺就是九尺。这下他笑了。
    摆在他面前的问题，还不是这样简单。按正规测量时间就要一个月。可是春播就要开始，党委会的日程上，测量加上开山的时间只有一个月。他想：时间我可以抢，可是测山的水平仪呢？测量杆呢？……
    从这天起，他的五十人“技术研究委员会”，一天连开了二、三次会，有时甚至开到大半夜。没有水平仪，用手测、目测代替，没有测量杆，用毛竹竿，没有皮带尺，就用草绳打结来代替。当测量完了一座山头后，他就用细竹竿插标，开山的专业队就沿着竹竿指引的方向开垦。测量后，先用锄头刮去线路的草皮，划出初模，再发动大家讨论定线。这样做虽然累得很，但到底也成啊——他们争得了时间，也为公社节省了一批买仪器的开支。
    能想到的事，他都一件件地做了，可是这万亩高标准的茶园，还有很多他想不到的事。连下了三天大雪，又下了一场大雨，满山满岗泥糊糊的，开山的社员一个个摔得像烂泥人。啊，水！这怎么治它呢？他想着想着，没提防“扑通”一声掉下了一个坑谷。哦！有办法了，有办法了，他爬起来马上发动社员干开了：每一坪园旁边开一条沟渠，每一坎挖一个深水坑，水归沟渠就不会满山窜，它一坎一坎地跌下深水坎，减缓了流速，就可以大大控制水土流失，既可养山又可蓄水抗旱。这时，县委组织全县各地公社第一书记来参观了，给他指点了很多宝贵的意见，比方说，园坪怎么才能坪坪通车子呀，车道怎么才能适应将来拖拉机耕作需要呀，等等，这样，使他一天比一天更聪明起来了……。
    那些天，他什么也顾不上，心里只是装着一座又一座的山。他昂头望去，荒山一天天越变越美了：那数十里内的大小山头，坪平如镜，一层层叠上天；坎直如线，劈条坎能当尺量；渠密如网，像条长龙绕山转；车道宽坦，“铁牛”上山能打转。望着这万亩高标准的茶园，他呼了一口长气笑了。为了这幅美丽的蓝图，一个月来他和“技术研究组”的伙伴们虽然走过了多少弯路，熬过了多少个难眠之夜，但是到底没有辜负党和群众的信任呵！
    现在，赖金石同志已经当上了公社的副社长，他还负责管理这万亩茶园。党和群众给了他更大的信任和荣誉。他回答道：“我一定和大家一起管得更好。”
