Film art pieces (generally called feature films) are a very popular and most mass-oriented form of art. A good film can reach tens of millions of viewers in a very short period; it can be screened quickly in towns and cities across the country, in the border regions of the motherland, in rural areas, and in factories and mines simultaneously, influencing people of all social strata. However, the creation of an art film involves a very complex process and requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, many people have doubted whether film art pieces can quickly reflect reality, and there have been various concerns.

Thanks to the Party's call and instructions, in the era of the Great Leap Forward, we adopted the style of documentary art films to quickly reflect the Great Leap Forward and eulogize it. Good films such as "Songs on the Reservoir," "Huang Baomei," and "Beside the March 8th River" were produced successively. At the same time, we also created excellent art films reflecting the Great Leap Forward, such as "Young People in Our Village," "Spring Fills the World," "Five Golden Flowers," and "A Riot of Color is Always Spring." This fully proves that as long as we liberate our minds, break down superstitions, put politics in command, and film artists have the creative enthusiasm and initiative to eulogize the Great Leap Forward, film art pieces, especially documentary art films, can completely and inevitably reflect the Great Leap Forward, reflecting the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary romanticism of the Chinese working people, who are full of vigor, high spirits, and fighting spirit.

This has also given us a deeper understanding of art films: since it is the most mass-oriented art, if it can quickly reflect the current reality, reflect the struggles and movements that the masses are most concerned about, reflect the new things that the masses are most interested in, and reflect the heroic role models that the broad masses are willing to emulate, and cooperate more quickly, more directly, and more effectively with the great production and construction movement, then wouldn't its mass character be broader and deeper? These films educate the people with the vivid, real, and concrete communist spirit in real life, and the driving role they play in the actual struggle is immeasurable. After "Five Golden Flowers" was screened in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, a wave of "learning from Jin Hua, comparing with Jin Hua, and surpassing Jin Hua" was set off among the broad masses of women. On a reservoir construction site, a movement of "a thousand golden flowers, ten thousand leaping forward flowers" was launched. This is a very vivid and powerful proof.

This time, after the Beijing Film Studio announced the "Pinglu Incident" in the People's Daily, it completed the documentary art film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" in sixteen working days. Through film art to reproduce this typical event, so that the people of the whole country can see with their own eyes the communist style and spirit of class friendship displayed in the "Pinglu Incident," this will give great encouragement to the working people in the national production and construction, and will greatly promote the existing communist style among the broad masses. At present, the film has just been released in Beijing, and more than 800 copies of the film have been booked from all over the country. This is an unprecedented event since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This shows how much the broad masses are looking forward to and eager to see this film. This once again proves that the more mass-oriented the art is, the more it should strive to reflect the new people and new things that the masses are most concerned about, and the faster it reflects them, the more welcome it will be to the masses. Of course, such works also require high quality, and we must not relax our efforts in this regard.

The great achievements of an era's art are often determined by an important condition: whether it can reflect the spirit of that era. If the works of our great era cannot reflect the soaring ambition and communist style, revolutionary heroism and optimism of our working people, they cannot express the spirit of the times.

To express this spirit of the times, we must first strive to reflect the real struggle with full enthusiasm, write more about realistic themes, express more about the mainstream of real life, and quickly express the new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward! Only in the process of actively and quickly reflecting reality can film art workers constantly delve into life and understand life, and then it is possible to create more excellent films and produce great works that reflect the spirit of this great era. This is not to belittle historical feature films in the slightest. Good historical feature films are also loved by the masses, and it is also an important aspect of film creation. However, striving to reflect the spirit of our times is always our primary task.

Film art pieces both adopt the documentary art film style to quickly reflect real people and real events, and strive to create feature films with higher artistic generalization that eulogize the Great Leap Forward. This can also be said to be a "walking on two legs" approach to quickly reflect reality. This is a road to promote film art pieces to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve proletarian politics, and to be more closely integrated with reality. On this basis, we believe that in the near future, works that are in line with the great era will surely be produced.

    欢迎歌颂共产主义风格的影片

    电影艺术片（一般称为故事片）是非常普及、最有群众性的艺术之一。一部好影片，可以在很短期间获得几千万的观众；它可以很快地在全国各地的城镇、祖国边疆、农村和工矿同时上映，影响各个阶层的人民。但是一部艺术片的产生要经过很复杂的过程，需要相当长的时间。因此，电影艺术片能否迅速反映现实，过去有许多人是怀疑的，存在着种种顾虑。
    感谢党的号召和指示，在大跃进的时代里，我们采用了纪录性艺术片这种样式，迅速地反映了大跃进，歌颂了大跃进，先后产生了像“水库上的歌声”、“黄宝妹”、“三八河边”等好影片。同时，我们也先后创作了“我们村里的年青人”、“春满人间”、“五朵金花”、“万紫千红总是春”这些优秀的反映大跃进的艺术片。这完全证明了，只要解放思想、破除迷信、政治挂帅，电影艺术家们有了歌颂大跃进的创作热情和积极性，电影艺术片，尤其是纪录性艺术片，完全可以、也必然能够反映大跃进，反映中国劳动人民这种干劲冲天、意气风发、斗志昂扬的革命英雄主义和革命的浪漫主义的精神。
    这也使我们对艺术片有了更加深刻的体会：既然是最有群众性的艺术，如果它能迅速反映当前的现实，反映群众最迫切关心的斗争和运动，反映群众最感到兴趣的新生的事物，反映广大群众愿意仿效的英雄榜样，更加迅速、更加直接有力地配合伟大的生产建设运动，那么，它的群众性岂不是更加广阔、更加深入了吗？这些影片以现实生活中活生生的、真实、具体的共产主义精神来教育人民，在现实斗争中所起的推动作用是无法估计的。“五朵金花”在云南大理白族自治州上映后，在广大妇女群众中间就掀起了一个“学金花、比金花、超金花”的热潮。还在一个水库的工地上，开展了“千朵金花，万朵跃进花”的运动。就是一个非常生动有力的证明。
    这一次北京电影制片厂在人民日报公布“平陆事件”后，在十六个工作日里就完成了“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”这部纪录性艺术片。通过电影艺术再现这个典型事件，使全国人民亲眼看到在“平陆事件”中所显示的人们的共产主义风格和阶级友爱精神，这将给全国生产建设上的劳动人民莫大的鼓舞，也必将大大发扬广大群众中已有的共产主义风格。目前，影片刚在北京上映，各地预定这部影片的拷贝已经达到八百多部。这是建国以来的空前盛况。这说明了广大群众是如何期待和渴望看到这部影片。这又一次证明：正是愈有群众性的艺术，就愈加应该努力去反映群众最关心的新人新事，反映得愈快，就愈加受到群众的欢迎。当然，这样的作品也要求有高的质量，我们决不能放松这方面的努力。
    一个时代的艺术，其伟大的成就，往往决定于一个重要的条件：看它能否反映出这一时代的精神。我们这个伟大时代的作品，如果不能反映我们劳动人民这种干劲冲天的雄心壮志和他们的共产主义风格、革命的英雄主义和乐观主义，就不能表现时代的精神。
    要表现这种时代精神，首先要求我们以充沛的热情努力去反映现实斗争，多描写现实题材，多表现现实生活中的主流，迅速表现大跃进中的新人新事！电影艺术工作者也只有在积极、迅速反映现实的过程中，不断地深入生活、理解生活，然后才有可能创造出更加优秀的影片，产生反映这个伟大时代精神的伟大作品。这样说，丝毫也没有贬低历史故事片的意思。好的历史故事片同样也是群众所喜爱的，它也是电影创作中的一个重要方面。但是，力求反映我们这个时代的精神，总是我们首要的任务。
    电影艺术片既采用纪录性艺术片样式来迅速反映真人真事，又努力创作艺术概括性更高的歌颂大跃进的故事片，这也可以说是迅速反映现实的“两条腿走路”的办法。这是一条促进电影艺术片更好地为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务，更加密切结合实际的道路。在这样的基础上，我们相信，不久的将来，一定会产生出和伟大时代相适应的作品来。
