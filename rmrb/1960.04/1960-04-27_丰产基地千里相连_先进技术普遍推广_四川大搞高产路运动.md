High-Yield Bases Linked by Thousands of Miles; Advanced Technologies Widely Promoted
    Sichuan Engages in a High-Yield Road Movement

    (Our report) Sichuan is vigorously building hundreds or thousands of *li* of high-yield roads along railways, highways, and major roads, implementing regional crop planting and standardized cultivation techniques. Currently, the area planted with spring crops along the high-yield roads throughout the province is approximately over ten million *mu*, and that planted with major spring crops accounts for about 30% of this year's planned total sown area.

    Vigorously developing high-yield roads is an important measure to concretely implement the principle of combining multiple planting for more yield with high-yield for more yield. This year, Sichuan has built on the experience of planting high-yield roads last year, generally organizing professional teams to establish high-yield roads along important transportation lines, based on the principles of overall planning, guaranteeing key areas, and division of labor and cooperation, with the commune or county as the unit. In the Neijiang, Yibin, Jiangjin, and Fuling special districts, the early rice fields on the high-yield roads are generally ploughed to a depth of over 1.2 *chi*, with 30,000 *jin* of base fertilizer applied. In the Nanchong special district, the early corn high-yield roads generally achieve five "goods": good base fertilizer application, good cultivation quality, good technical standards, good timely sowing, and good seedling management. According to preliminary plans from various regions, by effectively focusing on the high-yield roads that account for about 30% of the cultivated land area, it is possible to obtain products equivalent to half or more of the total annual output.

    Various regions are using high-yield roads as bases to vigorously promote advanced cultivation techniques and various yield-increasing measures. During the major spring sowing season, Linshui County's communes used the high-yield roads as classrooms and advanced cultivation experience as teaching materials, convening over 1,200 small-scale on-site sowing meetings, demonstrating layer by layer, and meticulously imparting knowledge, thereby ensuring that the technical standards of early rice, early corn, sweet potatoes, and other crops sown throughout the county meet requirements.

    Vigorously developing high-yield roads has accelerated agricultural infrastructure construction, promoted agricultural technological transformation, and created conditions for the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization. Since last winter, various regions have focused on high-yield roads, improving 5.1 million *mu* of soil, including 1 million *mu* of slopes converted into terraced fields, and constructing over 208,000 small-scale water conservancy projects. Some regions have also carried out production construction in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as residential area construction, in coordination with the high-yield roads. Each county in the Neijiang special district has generally established three farms on the high-yield roads: pig farms, horticulture farms, and fish farms.

    Party committees in various regions attach great importance to the leadership of high-yield roads. Special districts such as Jiangjin have established leadership organizations for high-yield roads at all levels, with dedicated personnel in charge.

### 丰产基地千里相连　先进技术普遍推广  四川大搞高产路运动

    丰产基地千里相连　先进技术普遍推广
    四川大搞高产路运动
    本报讯　四川各地在沿铁路、公路、大路等交通线两旁一、二里或更大的范围内，大建百里、千里高产路，实行作物种植区域化，耕作技术规格化。现在全省高产路上
  种植的小春作物约有一千多万亩，大春作物占今年计划播种总面积的30％左右。
    大搞高产路是具体贯彻多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针的一个重要措施。今年四川各地发扬去年种高产路的经验，普遍以社或县为单位，本着统筹全局、保证重点、分工协作的原则，组织专业队沿重要交通线建立丰产路。内江宜宾、江津、涪陵等专区高产路上的早稻田，普遍做到深耕一尺二寸以上，施底肥三万斤。南充专区早玉米高产路一般都达到了五好：底肥施得好、耕作质量好、技术规格好、及时播种好、苗期管理好。根据各地初步规划，切实抓好了占耕地面积30％左右的高产路，就可拿到相当于全年总产量的一半或更多的产品。
    各地以高产路为基地，大力推广先进耕作技术和各项增产措施。邻水县各公社在大春播种时，以高产路为课堂，先进耕作经验为教材，召开了一千二百多次小型播种现场会，层层示范，细心传授，从而保证全县播种的早稻、早玉米、红薯等作物的技术规格达到要求。
    大搞高产路，加速了农业基本建设，促进了农业技术改造，并为逐步实现农业机械化创造条件。去冬以来，各地以高产路为重点，改良土壤五百一十万亩，其中坡地改梯地一百万亩；兴建小型水利工程二十万八千多处。有些地区同时还进行了与高产路相适应的林、牧、副、渔的生产建设和居民点建设。内江专区各县普遍在高产路上建立三场：养猪场、园艺场、养鱼场。
    各地党委非常重视对高产路的领导。江津等专区都层层建立有高产路的领导机构，设有专人负责。
