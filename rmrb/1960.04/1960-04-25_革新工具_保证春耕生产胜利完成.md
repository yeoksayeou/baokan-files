Innovate Tools to Guarantee Victorious Completion of Spring Planting

    Drastically Improve Wind Power and Human-Powered Water Wheels
    More than 70,000 skilled craftsmen in the Handan area of Hebei Province are rushing to modify wind-powered and human-powered water wheels. So far, the city has manufactured more than 12,000 vehicles, all of which have been put into the fight against drought, saving nearly 100,000 laborers.
    Henan Creates Two More Well-Drilling Tools
    The Mangshan Commune Machinery Factory in Yongcheng County, Henan, has produced a motorized well-drilling machine. Three people can operate it to drill two machine wells, each 32 meters deep, in one day. Its efficiency is more than six times higher than that of the "Rocket Cone."
    Also, the Wadian Commune in Nanyang County, Henan, has produced a "Universal Sack Awl," which can drill a machine well more than seven zhang (approx. 23 meters) deep in sixteen to eighteen hours.
    Establish a Transportation Network with Bamboo and Wood Tracks
    Members of the Zhiping Commune in Qingning County, Fujian Province, worked hard for fifteen days to build a mountain transportation network spanning 206.5 kilometers, with bamboo and wood tracks as the backbone.
    Now, in this commune, whether it is high mountains, steep ridges, or valleys and plains, the transportation of grain, fertilizer, wood, etc., basically no longer requires manual carrying.
    Innovate Tools for Turning Green Manure Under
    Changde County, Hunan Province, has reformed a complete set of tools for turning green manure under. As of now, the county has modified and added 11,390 wooden double-wheeled double-share plows, more than 4,000 three-purpose harrows (three purposes: trampling green manure into the mud, spreading lime, and harrowing until rotten), and more than 1,200 rolling knife devices, providing enough new tools to complete the task of turning green manure under in a timely manner.
    Clever Girl Creates a System Where One Animal Pulls Twelve Grinding Stones
    Female commune member Zheng Ying of Lizhai Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, successfully created a system where "one animal pulls twelve grinding stones." It can grind 2,500 jin (1250 kg) of flour per day, and its efficiency is 26 times higher than that of one person and one animal grinding flour in the past.
    Zheng Ying is nineteen years old this year. Since 1958, she has successively created and modified more than 30 kinds of new tools and has since been called a clever girl by the masses.
    Weeding Implements Increase Efficiency Fourfold
    Pingnan County, Guangxi, has repaired and promoted more than 60,000 weeding implements. This weeding implement is manufactured according to the structure of the cultivating implements in northern China. It is easy to make. Generally, one person can only weed 1.1 mu (approx. 0.07 ha) of land with their feet in one day, while a weeding implement can weed 5.6 mu (approx. 0.37 ha).
    Field-Side Mobile Water Turbine
    Liancheng County, Fujian Province, has successfully manufactured a low-water-level field-side bucket-type mobile water turbine suitable for realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of field operations in small hilly fields. This water turbine can directly drive rice transplanters, direct seeders, threshers, windmills, sweet potato slicers, and feed processing machines for field operations.
    A Set of New Paddy Field Tools
    Qianshan County, Jiangxi Province, located in the Wuyi Mountains, has reformed tools in accordance with local conditions and created a set of semi-mechanized agricultural tools suitable for field operations in mountainous areas, greatly improving labor efficiency.
    Now, this county has new agricultural tools for everything from plowing and harrowing, transplanting, and weeding to harvesting in paddy field operations.
    Turpan Establishes a Repair and Maintenance Network
    People's communes in Turpan County, Xinjiang, have built agricultural tool repair and maintenance factories on a large scale, forming a county-wide agricultural tool repair and maintenance network. More than 95% of the damaged agricultural tools in the county have been repaired in time and put into production, which has played an important role in completing the spring plowing task in Turpan County quickly and well.

    革新工具　保证春耕生产胜利完成
    大改风力人力水车
    河北邯郸地区七万多名能工巧匠突击改制风力、人力两用水车。目前，全市已制造出一万二千多辆，全部投入了抗旱斗争，节省出近十万个劳动力。
    河南又创两种打井工具
    河南永城县芒山公社机械厂制成机动打井机，三人操作一天可打三十二米深的机井两眼，工效比“火箭锥”高六倍多。
    又，河南南阳县瓦店公社制出一种“万能麻袋锥”，这种锥在十六到十八个小时内，就能打成一眼七丈多深的机井。
    以竹木轨建成交通网
    福建省清宁县治平公社社员，奋战十五天，建成了长二百零六点五公里、以竹木轨道为骨干的山区交通网。
    现在，这个公社不论是高山峻岭、或是峡谷平地，运粮食、肥料、木材等，已基本上不用人挑。
    革新翻犁绿肥工具
    湖南省常德县成套改革翻犁绿肥工具。全县到目前止，已改装、添置木质双轮双铧犁一万一千三百九十张，三用耙（三用即用于踩青入泥、撒石灰、耙烂）四千多张，滚刀器一千二百多张，为适时完成翻犁绿肥的任务备足了新利器。
    巧姑娘创一畜拉十二磨
    山西省翼城县里寨公社女社员郑英，创造“一畜拉十二盘磨”成功，一天可磨面二千五百斤，工效比过去一人一畜磨面高二十六倍。
    郑英今年十九岁，自一九五八年以来，她先后创造和改制成功新式工具三十多种，从此被群众称为巧姑娘。
    耘田器提高工效四倍
    广西平南县修造和推广了六万多架耘田器。这种耘田器是按照我国北方地区的中耕器的结构制造的，制作容易，一般一个人用脚耘田一天只能耘一点一亩，而用耘田器可耘五点六亩。
    田头流动水轮机
    福建省连城县制造成功了一种低水位的、适合小丘山田实现田间操作半机械化、机械化的田头戽斗式流动水轮机。这种水轮机可以带动插秧机、直播机、脱粒机、风车、薯类切片机和饲料加工机等直接进行田间操作。
    一套水田作业新农具
    地处武夷山区的江西铅山县，因地制宜改革工具，创制出一套适合山区田间作业的半机械化农具，大大提高了劳动效率。
    现在，这个县从水田作业的耕耙、插秧、耘田直到收割，都已经有了新式农具。
    吐鲁番建成修配网
    新疆吐鲁番县各人民公社大建农具修配厂，组成了全县的农具修配网。全县损坏的农具有百分之九十五以上，已及时修好投入了生产，这对又快又好地完成吐鲁番县的春耕任务起了重要作用。
