    The Friendship Between the Hungarian and Chinese People
    Dr. Molnár Erik, Chairman of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association
    The liberation of our country and the establishment of the proletarian regime have established a close and sincerely cooperative friendship between the people of China and Hungary. Such friendship can only grow, thrive, and be consolidated among the people of all countries building socialism, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and in the fertile soil of proletarian internationalism.

    However, this does not mean that there was no contact between our two peoples before our country was liberated and the People's Republic of China was founded. If we want to understand the formation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples, it is incomplete to only look at the history of the past decade or so. As early as more than two hundred years ago, Hungarian documents about China were discovered in Hungary. In the last few decades before liberation, our two peoples were also under cruel oppression and exploitation, but during these decades, there was a feeling of shared destiny and mutual concern between the oppressed peoples of the two countries. The Hungarian workers and underground communist fighters closely watched the struggle of the Chinese proletariat. The events of the Guangzhou Commune in the 1920s, the world-renowned and indomitable Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and the subsequent heroic struggles of the Chinese people against Japanese aggressors and Kuomintang reactionaries all received the utmost sympathy from the Hungarian people. József Attila, the greatest poet of the Hungarian working class, accurately expressed this sentiment in a poem he wrote in 1936. In concise verses, he vehemently attacked the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At this time, outstanding writers in the ranks of Chinese new literature, especially the great Mr. Lu Xun, introduced the works of Sándor Petőfi, the great freedom fighter and poet of Hungary, to China. Through Lu Xun's introduction, outstanding young Chinese poets such as Bai Mang, who died heroically, developed a strong interest in Petőfi's art. In this way, the two peoples gradually came to know and understand each other. However, only after our country was liberated and the People's Republic of China was established were the most favorable conditions created for the establishment of close friendship and planned cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields between the working people of the two countries.

    The government of the Hungarian People's Republic recognized the People's Republic of China on October 4, 1949. From then on, the connections between our two countries in all aspects developed rapidly. Our friendship began ten years ago in this way, and since then, it has not only become more consolidated day by day, but has also stood the test of time and history. When American imperialism carried out its criminal aggression in Korea, our people wholeheartedly stood on the side of the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought alongside them. In October 1956, counter-revolutionaries in Hungary, manipulated by imperialism, launched an armed rebellion. Throughout the October counter-revolutionary events and thereafter, in the Hungarian people's struggle to crush and eliminate all economic and ideological influences of the counter-revolutionaries, the Chinese government and the Chinese people promptly helped and supported their brothers in difficulty. In addition to material assistance, the political and theoretical assistance given to us by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people was of particular importance. Our people will always be grateful for all of this. Since then, our people have developed an extremely strong interest in the great socialist construction work of the Chinese people. Our people paid close attention to the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle of the Chinese people in 1957. Many lessons of this struggle have great practical significance in the struggle between the two roads after the counter-revolutionary events in our country. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects and departments of industry and agriculture in China in 1958 were warmly welcomed and valued by the Hungarian people. Similarly, our people also watched with incomparable joy all the efforts made by the Chinese people to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and the new brilliant achievements of the continued leap forward in 1959. In the just struggle of the Chinese people to unify their motherland and defend world peace, the Hungarian people will always be with the Chinese people, supporting your struggle to liberate Taiwan and expose the aggressive intentions of American imperialism.

    For ten years, the exchanges between our two peoples in political, ideological, and cultural fields have continued to expand, and our friendship has deepened day by day. The examples of this are too numerous to mention. Let us only mention one or two things to illustrate. In just a short decade, in all aspects of science, art, and literature, we have shared each other's most outstanding achievements and helped each other.

    We are extremely pleased that the visit of the Hungarian National Folk Art Troupe to China in 1952 left a deep impression on the minds of the Chinese people. The art troupe's excellent program "Bottle Dance" was welcomed by the Chinese audience. The music of "Bottle Dance" has almost become a Chinese folk song, sung everywhere. The Hungarian audience also misses the visit of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to our country in 1955. The performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe and the Guangzhou Folk Music Troupe in Hungary were also very popular.

    Our two peoples have also gained mutual understanding and assistance in various aspects through sending experts, exchanging technical information, and holding exhibitions. In the work of exchanging scientific and cultural achievements and promoting mutual understanding, the mutual publication of books has played a great role. From 1950 to 1958, the People's Republic of China published about 800,000 copies of Hungarian classical and modern writers' works. In Hungary, in the same few years, more than 70 kinds of Chinese writers' works were published, with nearly 700,000 copies, including a collection of folk songs from the Book of Songs to the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and excellent literary works from classical to modern China.

    We can also find a series of such friendly cooperation facts from economic, trade, technical cooperation, cultural or sports, mass organizations and other aspects of cooperation. However, more meaningful than all this is the tremendous educational power of the deep friendship between the two peoples for each of us. Hungarian technical experts who came to China with their knowledge, although the time they spent in China varied, were most deeply and unforgettably impressed by the people—the ordinary Chinese workers. The Hungarian experts in China gained the respect, welcome, and humble and enthusiastic hospitality of the Chinese people with their scientific knowledge. They formed an unbreakable friendship with their Chinese comrades in their common labor to overcome difficulties, based on mutual respect.

    The friendly relations between our two countries are developing and consolidating day by day. It is particularly worth mentioning the increasingly frequent mutual visits of our two countries' leaders. In the spring of 1959, the Hungarian government delegation led by Comrade Münnich visited China. In the autumn, Chairman Dobi attended the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and many other celebrations. During this year, the Chinese Party and government delegation, led by Comrade Zhu De and Comrade Tan Zhenlin, visited our country. This year, Chairman Liu Shaoqi will be invited to visit our country. When the delegation led by Comrade Münnich visited China last year, the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed. This treaty is the fullest proof of the development of friendly relations between the two peoples, and it also opened a new stage in the friendship between Hungary and China.

    In order to further develop the friendship between us, the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association was established in Beijing in the autumn of 1958. The Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association was established in Budapest in the spring of 1959. The Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association creates all conditions to enable the Hungarian people to understand China more widely and deeply, so as to promote the further development of Hungarian-Chinese friendship.

    We are convinced that the friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese people, from its establishment and development to the achievements and victories it has achieved now, will produce more abundant and beautiful fruits of friendship. All of this is for the happiness and progress of the two peoples, for the victory of the cause of socialist construction, and for world peace.

    匈中人民的友谊
    匈中友好协会主席　莫尔纳尔·埃里克博士
    我们祖国的解放和无产阶级政权的确立，使中匈两国人民建立了亲密无间、真诚合作的友谊关系。这样的友谊只有在建设社会主义的各国人民中间，在马克思列宁主义基础上，在无产阶级的国际主义的沃土上，才能成长、壮大和巩固。
    但是这并不意味着当我们祖国还没有获得解放和中华人民共和国成立之前，我们两国人民就毫无联系了。如果我们要想了解中匈两国人民之间友谊的形成和发展，仅看到这十几年的历史是不全面的。早在二百多年前，在匈牙利就发现了关于中国的匈文资料。在解放前最后几十年，我们两国人民同样处于残酷的压迫剥削之下，但是就在这几十年间，在两国被压迫人民之间存在着一种同呼吸、共命运、彼此关怀的感情上的联系。匈牙利的工人们，地下共产主义的战士们，密切注视着中国无产阶级的斗争。二十年代广州公社的事迹，中国工农红军举世闻名、坚韧不拔的长征，以及后来中国人民反对日本侵略者和国民党反动派的英勇斗争，都得到匈牙利人民无比深切的同情。匈牙利工人阶级的最伟大的诗人尤热夫·阿迪罗在1936年写的诗歌中，就曾确切地表达了这种感情。他用精炼的诗句猛烈地抨击了国民党反动派的统治。这时，中国新文学队伍中的优秀作家、首先是伟大的鲁迅先生，把匈牙利伟大的自由战士、诗人裴多菲的作品介绍到了中国。通过鲁迅先生的介绍，中国青年一代优秀的诗人如英勇牺牲了的白莽等都对裴多菲的艺术产生了浓厚的兴趣。两国人民就这样逐渐有了认识和了解。但是，只有在我们祖国得到解放和中华人民共和国成立之后，才为两国劳动人民建立密切的友谊和在政治、经济、文化方面有计划的合作创造了最有利的条件。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府在1949年10月4日就承认了中华人民共和国。从那时起，我们两国之间各方面的联系迅速发展起来。我们的友谊在十年前就这样开始了，从那时起，它不但一天比一天更加巩固，而且还经受了时间和历史的考验。当美帝国主义在朝鲜进行罪恶的侵略时，我国人民一心一意地站在英勇的朝鲜人民和同他们并肩作战的中国人民志愿军一边。1956年10月，在帝国主义操纵下的匈牙利的反革命分子进行了武装叛乱。在整个十月反革命事件中以及以后匈牙利人民为粉碎和消除反革命分子在经济上和人们思想上的一切影响的斗争中，中国政府和中国人民及时地帮助和支持了自己困难的兄弟。除了物质援助之外，中国共产党和中国人民在政治上理论上给我们的援助，具有特别重要的意义。对这一切，我国人民永远怀着感激的心情。此后我国人民对中国人民伟大的社会主义建设工作产生了无比强烈的兴趣。我国人民极为关切地注意到中国人民1957年的整风和反右斗争的胜利。这一斗争的很多教训在我国反革命事件后两条道路的斗争中有着很大的现实意义。1958年中国工农业各方面各部门大跃进的成就，受到匈牙利人民的热烈欢迎和重视。同样地，我国人民也以无比欢欣的心情注视着中国人民为提前完成第二个五年计划所做的一切努力和1959年继续跃进的新的光辉成就。在中国人民为统一祖国、保卫世界和平而进行的正义斗争中，匈牙利人民永远和中国人民在一起，支持你们为解放台湾、揭露美帝国主义侵略意图所进行的斗争。
    十年以来，我们两国人民在政治、思想、文化各方面的来往不断扩大，友谊日益加深。这方面的例子是不胜枚举的。我们只举出其中一两件事情来说明吧。仅仅在短促的十年间，在科学、艺术、文学的各个方面，我们彼此都共享了两国最出色的成就，互相得到了帮助。
    使我们极为高兴的是，1952年匈牙利国家人民艺术团在中国的访问演出，在中国人民的心目中留下了深刻的印象。艺术团优秀的节目“瓶舞”受到了中国观众的欢迎。“瓶舞”的舞曲几乎变成了中国的民歌，处处被人们歌唱着。匈牙利的观众们也都在怀念中国京剧团1955年在我国的访问演出。中国杂技团和广州民间音乐团在匈牙利的演出也是倍受欢迎的。
    我们两国人民还通过派遣专家、交换技术资料、举办展览会等方式在各方面得到互相了解和帮助。在交流科学文化成果、促进互相了解的工作中，互相出版书籍起了很大的作用。人民中国从1950年到1958年间出版了匈牙利古典和现代作家的作品约八十万册。在匈牙利，在同样的几年中，七十多种中国作家的作品发行了将近七十万册，其中包括了从诗经到1958年大跃进的民歌选集、从古典到现代中国的优秀文学作品。
    我们还能从经济、贸易、技术合作、文化或体育、群众团体等合作方面，找到一连串这样友好的合作的事实。但是，比这一切都更为有意义的是两国人民之间深厚的友谊对我们每个人的巨大的教育力量。带着自己知识来到中国的匈牙利技术专家们，虽然在中国的时间各不相同，但是，给他们最深刻、最难忘的印象的是人民——普通的中国劳动者。在中国的匈牙利专家以自己的科学知识获得了中国人民的尊重、欢迎和谦虚、热情的款待。他们同中国同志在一起克服困难的共同劳动中，在互相尊重的基础上，结成了牢不可破的友谊。
    我们两国国家之间的友好关系在日益发展和巩固。特别值得提起的是我们两国领导人日渐频繁的互相访问。1959年春天，由明尼赫同志率领的匈牙利政府代表团访问了中国。秋天，道比主席参加了中华人民共和国建国十周年的纪念和其他许多庆祝活动。在这一年间，中国党和政府代表团在朱德同志和谭震林同志率领下访问了我国。今年刘少奇主席将要被邀访问我们国家。明尼赫同志率领的代表团去年访问中国的时候，签订了中匈友好合作条约。这个条约是两国人民友好关系发展的最充分的证明，同时也开辟了匈中友谊的新阶段。
    为了更进一步发展我们之间的友谊，1958年秋天在北京成立了中匈友好协会。1959年春天在布达佩斯成立了匈中友好协会。匈中友好协会创造一切条件，使匈牙利人民更广泛更深刻地了解中国，以促进匈中友谊的进一步发展。
    我们确信，匈牙利人民和中国人民的友谊从建立、发展到现在所取得的成就和胜利，将产生更加丰硕美好的友谊果实。这一切，都是为了两国人民的幸福和进步，为了社会主义建设事业的胜利，为了世界的和平。
