Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian Telegram: The Lushun-Dalian railway and shipping departments, using the red thread of large-scale collaboration, strung together seventeen units, including the city's hotels, service industries, catering industries, and urban transportation departments, to form a "One-Dragon Passenger Transport" system. This system provides passengers with food, lodging, and transportation, linking every aspect of the journey, from trains and ships to stations and hotels, in a seamless chain. It achieves "passengers ticketed home, luggage weighed to the end," eliminating the need for additional procedures for changing trains and ships, and maximizing convenience for passengers.

Lushun-Dalian boasts convenient transportation and serves as a transit port for traffic between Northeast China and East and North China. To provide passengers with more comfortable and convenient travel conditions, as early as December of last year, the Lushun-Dalian railway passenger transport department and Dalian Port, under the unified leadership of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, drawing on the experience of Qinhuangdao's "One-Dragon" collaborative transport for goods, jointly formed a "One-Dragon" Passenger Service Coordination Committee with the city's transportation departments, catering, hotels, and service industries. They began organizing "One-Dragon" passenger transport services. They first conducted pilot programs on the Shanghai-Dalian regular liner route (with many passengers and long routes), the Yantai-Dalian regular liner route (with short routes and frequent train transfers), and the Harbin-Dalian passenger express train (running through the three northeastern provinces), achieving excellent results. Subsequently, this experience was widely promoted on various railway main lines and major shipping routes.

The main approach of the "One-Dragon" passenger transport service is to expand the scope of combined transportation based on the original water-land intermodal transport. Originally, only larger ports and stations issued water-land intermodal tickets, but now many medium and small ports and stations also handle intermodal business. Passengers can purchase water-land intermodal tickets from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and many ports and stations in Northeast China and Shandong, and transfer directly to trains and ships south or north through Dalian Port. Furthermore, the "four reservations" (booking train, bus, tricycle, and hotel accommodation tickets) and "five sales" (pre-selling train, ship, bus, tram, and hotel accommodation tickets) methods were adopted on the trains and ships participating in the "One-Dragon" transport. Passengers can complete train and ship transfer and luggage transfer procedures at one time. These trains and ships collect statistics on passenger flow and food and lodging requirements during the journey, and issue forecasts four hours before the ship arrives at the port, notifying the city's transportation departments and service industries to make comprehensive arrangements for passengers' food, lodging, and transportation in advance. The urban transportation department allocates vehicles according to the forecast in a planned manner to evacuate passengers as quickly as possible; the hotel industry also reasonably allocates hotels according to the convenience of passengers' work and sends service personnel to the port and station to receive passengers and send them to the hotels; the catering industry has designated specialized restaurants to operate around the clock to ensure that passengers can eat.

In the past two months, the "One-Dragon Passenger Transport Service" coordinating units have received more than 8,000 letters of commendation. One passenger praised: "Service work blossoms, everyone praises the 'Dragon Car,' changing ships and staying in hotels is convenient, and the attentive care is better than home." The "One-Dragon" passenger transport service has also created favorable conditions for the planning of transportation and service work and for fully exploiting the potential of transportation tools.

Recently, the Shenyang Railway Bureau summarized and promoted the "One-Dragon" passenger transport service experience of Lushun-Dalian. The entire bureau has formed twelve "Dragon" lines for railway, seaport, and highway passenger intermodal transport, and two local "Dragon" lines connecting railway and service departments. A "Dragon Network" centered on stations and ports, spanning rivers and seas, connecting urban and rural areas, and serving passengers in all directions is taking shape.

People's Daily, Chengdu, 20th: The Longchang County bus station, railway station, and county transportation company in Sichuan Province have launched a regional passenger and luggage "One-Dragon" large-scale collaborative intermodal transport service, which greatly facilitates passengers. Since April of last year, they have transported more than 11,000 passengers and more than 16,000 pieces of luggage.

Longchang County is the meeting point of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, and the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway. Many passengers traveling to and from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces gather and disperse here. Due to the large number of people and the long distance between the railway station and the bus station, passengers had "five worries" on the train and "five busyness" after getting off the train before the intermodal transport began. They worried about not being able to buy tickets after arriving in Longchang, worried about not being able to find porters to carry their luggage, worried about not being able to consign their luggage, worried about their luggage being lost, and worried about not being able to find a hotel. Therefore, as soon as they got off the train, they were busy collecting luggage, finding porters, buying tickets, consigning luggage, and finding a hotel. This took time, increased fatigue, and was very inconvenient. After the implementation of intermodal transport, at each intermodal station, passengers only need to buy an intermodal passenger ticket, and after arriving in Longchang, they can continue to transfer to trains or buses, and luggage can also be consigned at the starting station at one time. The "five worries" have become "five assurances," and the "five busyness" have become "five conveniences." At the same time, after the implementation of intermodal transport, the luggage is uniformly transported by the county transportation company from the station, and manpower and tools are used in a concentrated manner, reducing the number of porters from the original forty to ten; the procedures for ticket sales and luggage handling at the station have also been reduced, saving more than 500 ticket books alone.

The experience of Longchang's intermodal large-scale collaboration is currently being promoted in stations and ports throughout Sichuan.

### 旅客一票到家　行李一磅到底　包食包住包行  旅大组织客运“一条龙”  四川推广隆昌县旅客、行李“一条龙”联运经验

    旅客一票到家　行李一磅到底　包食包住包行
    旅大组织客运“一条龙”
    四川推广隆昌县旅客、行李“一条龙”联运经验
    据新华社旅大电　旅大市铁路、航运部门用大协作的红线，把全市的旅店、服务业、饮食业和城市交通部门等十七个单位穿在一起，组成了“客运一条龙运输”，对旅客实行包食、包住、包行，使旅行过程中的车船站店各个环节，一线相联，环环紧扣，作到了“旅客一票到家，行李一磅到底”，车船换乘不用另办手续，最大限度的方便了旅客。
    旅大市交通方便，是东北各地与华东、华北交通的中转港口。为了给旅客准备更舒适、更方便的旅行条件，早在去年12月，旅大市的铁路客运部门和大连港就在中共旅大市委的统一领导下，根据秦皇岛货运一条龙协作运输的经验，和市内交通部门、饮食、旅店、服务行业共同组成了客运服务“一条龙”协作委员会，着手组织客运服务“一条龙”运输。他们首先在旅客多、航线长的上海到大连的定期班轮，航线短、换乘火车多的烟台到大连的定期班轮和贯穿东北三省的哈尔滨到大连的旅客快车上进行了试点，收到了很好的效果。接着就在各条铁路干线和主要航线上普遍推行了这一经验。
    客运服务“一条龙”运输的主要作法是：在原有的水陆联运的基础上，扩大联运范围。原来只有较大的港站发售水陆联运票，现在许多中、小港站也都办理联运业务。旅客可以从北京、上海、天津和东北、山东等许多港站，买到水陆联运票，经过大连港直接换乘车船南下或北上。并且在参加“一条龙”运输的车船上采用了四约（预约火车、汽车、三轮车和旅店住宿票）、五售（预售火车、轮船、汽车、电车票和旅店住宿票）办法，旅客可以一次办完车船换乘和行李转运手续。这些车船在旅途中统计旅客流向和食、宿要求，船到港四小时之前，就发出预报，分别通知市内交通部门和服务行业，事先为旅客的食、住、行全面作好安排。市内交通部门根据预报有计划地调拨车辆，尽快地疏散旅客；旅馆业也根据旅客的工作方便合理分配旅店，并派服务人员到港站接待旅客，送到旅店；饮食业为了保证旅客就食指定了专门饭店，通宵营业。
    近两个月以来，“客运服务一条龙运输”各协作单位共收到表扬信八千多封。有个旅客赞颂道：服务工作开红花，坐上“龙车”人人夸，换船住店都方便，照顾周到胜于家。客运服务“一条龙”运输也为运输和服务业工作的计划性，和充分发挥运输工具的潜力创造了良好条件。
    最近，沈阳铁路局总结和推广了旅大市客运服务“一条龙”经验，全局已经组成了铁路、海港、公路旅客联运“龙”十二条，铁路和服务部门相衔接的地方“龙”两条。一个以站、港为中心，横跨江海，联系城乡，四通八达为旅客服务的“龙网”，正在形成中。
    本报成都20日电　四川省隆昌县汽车站、火车站和县运输公司，开办区域性旅客、行李“一条龙”大协作联运业务，大大方便了旅客。从去年4月以来，他们已联运旅客一万一千多人，行李一万六千多件。
    隆昌县是成渝铁路、成渝公路和川滇公路的交会点，许多来往川、滇、黔三省的旅客，都在这里集散。由于人多，火车站与汽车站又相隔较远，在没有联运以前，旅客在车上有“五耽心”，下车后有“五忙”。他们耽心到隆昌后买不到车票，耽心找不到搬运工人搬行李，耽心交运不上行李，耽心行李会丢失，耽心找不到旅馆，因此一下车，就忙着取行李，找搬运工人，买车票，交行李，找旅馆，这样要花费时间，增加疲劳，很不方便。开展联运以后，在联运的各站，旅客只要买上一张联运客票，到隆昌后，就可以继续转乘火车或汽车，行李也可在起点站一次交运，“五耽心”变成了“五放心”，“五忙”变成了“五方便”。同时，实行联运以后，行李由车站统一交县运输公司搬运，人力和工具集中使用，使搬运工人由原来的四十人减少到十人；车站售票和办理行李的手续也减少了，仅票据就节约了五百多本。
    隆昌联运大协作的经验，目前已在四川各地车站、港口码头推广。
