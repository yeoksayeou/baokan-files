　　 本报重庆12日电 Chongqing, April 12th (report from our newspaper) The broad masses of commune members of the Shangxin Street People's Commune in Chongqing have plunged into a vigorous mechanization and semi-mechanization movement. Currently, over 60% of the heavy manual labor in all sectors of the commune has been replaced by machinery, and the commune has taken on a completely new look.

　　This commune has technical innovation in every trade and invention in every aspect. All ten restaurants and six public canteens in the commune have now achieved mechanization, semi-mechanization, and steam-powered operation. The remaining twenty-five public canteens generally have the "four major pieces" (vegetable cutting machine, rice washing machine, steamed bun machine, dishwashing machine), and the large and medium-sized restaurants even have the "seven major pieces" (universal stove, dishwashing machine, meat cutting machine, vegetable cutting machine, electric grinder, conveyor belt, steam). Due to the reform of cooking equipment, the supply capacity of the restaurants has increased twofold compared to the past. In addition, the grain department has achieved a one-stop automation process for unloading, storage, processing, and sales; the non-staple food stores have achieved automatic liquid vending and automatic solid vending; the sewing industry has achieved electrification; the bank has created automatic money counting machines, coin sorting calculators, interest calculators, and binding machines; the post office has achieved automatic newspaper and magazine vending and automatic stamp vending; transportation has achieved rail transport, cableways, and vehicle transport, eliminating carrying poles and baskets; the commune hospital, cinema, clock shop, etc., also have innovations and inventions.

　　These innovations and inventions have not only improved work efficiency and saved labor but have also promoted the rapid development of commune industry. The total output value of the Shangxin Street People's Commune's hardware processing factory, hat and shoe factory, sewing factory, maternal and child supplies processing factory, and other industries was 410,000 yuan in February and increased to 530,000 yuan in March, equivalent to one-half of the total output value for the entire year of 1959.

　　The vigorous technical innovation in all sectors enables the commune to better organize the lives of its members. After the Tanzi Kou public canteen achieved mechanized and steam-powered steaming, washing, cutting, and cooking, it improved efficiency. The rice-to-cooked rice ratio increased from three jin of cooked rice per jin of rice to four jin, making the canteen better and better. Without adding a single cook, the number of diners increased from more than 300 to more than 500. At the same time, simple bathrooms, stoves, tea garden snack bars, grain supply departments, study rooms, and hostels were added, making the public canteen not only the center of the economic activities of the commune members but also the center for studying politics, culture, and conducting socialist education.

　　According to incomplete statistics, through technical innovation, the entire commune not only released more than 400 people to directly participate in construction and industrial and agricultural production but also tapped potential and newly established six residential service points, thirteen nurseries, six sewing factories, children's toy factories, and machine repair factories, nine maternal and child health care centers and health care stations, and three simple hostels, forming a network of collective welfare undertakings and living services scattered throughout the area. This has greatly promoted the consolidation and development of the commune.

    上新街公社大闹机械化
    公社工业迅速发展　服务事业越办越好
    本报重庆12日电　重庆上新街人民公社的广大社员卷入了热火朝天的机械化、半机械化运动。现在，全公社各行各业60％以上的笨重体力劳动被机械所代替，公社面貌焕然一新。
    这个公社行行业业都有技术革新，环环节节都有创造发明，全公社十个饮食店、六个公共食堂，目前已全部实现了机械化半机械化和蒸汽化。其余二十五个公共食堂，一般都有四大件（切菜机、淘米机、馒头机、洗碗机），大、中型餐厅还有七大件（万能灶、洗碗机、切肉机、切菜机、电磨、传送带、蒸汽）。由于炊具的改革，餐厅的供应能力比过去提高了两倍。此外，粮食部门实现了起卸、保管、加工、销售自动化一条龙；副食品门市部实现了液体电动自动售货、固体电动自动售货、缝纫行业实现了电动化；银行创制了自动点钞机，硬币分类计算器、利息计算机、包扎机；邮局实现了自动售报刊、自动售邮票；运输实现了轨道化、索道化、车子化，丢掉了扁担和箩筐；公社医院、电影院、钟表店等也都有革新创造。
    这些革新创造不仅提高了工作效率，节约了劳动力，而且推动了公社工业的迅速发展。上新街人民公社的五金加工厂、帽鞋厂、缝纫厂、妇幼用具加工厂等工业的总产值，2月份为四十一万元，3月份增加到五十三万元，相当于1959年全年总产值的二分之一。
    各行各业大闹技术革新，使公社能更好的组织社员的生活。滩子口公共食堂实现了蒸、洗、切、煮机械化、蒸汽化后，提高了效率，大米出饭率由每斤大米蒸饭三斤提高到四斤，使食堂越办越好，没有增加一个炊事员，搭伙人数由原来的三百多人增加为五百多人。同时还新增了简易浴室、老虎灶、茶园小食部、粮食供应部、学习室、招待所等，使公共食堂不仅是社员经济活动的中心，而且成为学习政治、文化，进行社会主义教育的中心。
    据不完全的统计，全公社通过技术革新，不仅抽出了四百多人去直接参加建设及工农业生产，而且还挖掘潜力，新办了居民服务点六个，托儿所十三个，缝纫厂、儿童玩具厂、机修厂等六个，妇幼保健院、卫生保健站九个，简易招待所三个，形成了星罗棋布的集体福利事业和生活服务网。这样就大大促进了公社的巩固和发展。
