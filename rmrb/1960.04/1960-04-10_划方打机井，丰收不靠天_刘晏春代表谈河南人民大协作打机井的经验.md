Comrades Representatives:

I fully endorse and resolutely implement the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I would like to speak about the issue of large-scale mechanical well squares in Henan Province.

Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, water conservancy construction in Henan has entered a new stage of comprehensive development, integrated utilization, and a combination of large, medium, and small projects. In the development of groundwater, we have also moved from digging wells for springs and using human and animal power to draw water to centralized technical leadership in designated areas and large-scale mechanical well squares. During the great drought resistance struggle since July 1959, many areas relied heavily on groundwater due to the insufficient surface water sources, achieving victory in the drought resistance struggle. Therefore, further developing and utilizing groundwater for irrigation became an urgent demand of the masses. Based on this situation, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in its water conservancy construction plan for last winter and this spring, clearly put forward the task of digging 100,000 mechanical wells in the first half of 1960, in addition to actively building other projects. This task was warmly welcomed by the masses, and well-digging movements quickly unfolded across various regions. The Nanyang area, with ten people's communes in the four counties of Nanyang, Tanghe, Xinye, and Dengxian, broke down commune and county boundaries and designated a one-million-mu "mechanical well square," unified command, and concentrated 18,000 laborers to plan for more than 2,200 mechanical wells. They adopted the method of relying on the masses, launching a large-scale mass movement, and engaging in large-scale operations. In two months, they completed 2,934 wells and immediately used them to irrigate more than 550,000 mu of land. Coupled with the gravity irrigation of canals, the task of watering the wheat has been completed, achieving the standard of "double insurance" for irrigation with both wells and canals. The masses summarized the benefits of drawing squares to dig wells as follows: First, it is not restricted by administrative divisions, allowing for rational layout; second, it is convenient to strengthen leadership, summarize and exchange experience in a timely manner; third, it is convenient to adopt assembly-line construction methods and fully utilize the efficiency of tools; fourth, it is convenient to leverage the wisdom of the masses and engage in technical revolution on a large scale; fifth, it is convenient to concentrate production, manufacture materials, and use them locally. Therefore, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee promptly convened a battlefield conference to promote this advanced experience. After key experiments were conducted in various regions in combination with local experience, the movement to designate squares for mechanical well-digging was launched across the province. So far, the province has planned more than 700 large and small "mechanical well squares" covering tens of thousands of mu, hundreds of thousands of mu, millions of mu, and even millions of mu, covering an area of more than 50 million mu. More than 30,000 specialized well-digging teams, comprising more than 1.4 million people, were organized to weave mats, burn bricks, dig wells, install machinery, and put them into use on the spot. While large-scale mechanical well squares were being built in the plains, well-digging movements were also widely launched in hilly areas. The heroic people on the Mangshan Ridge put forward the slogan: "Drill through Mangshan Ridge, draw out underground springs, water the dry fields, rely on people, not on heaven." In the past month, they have completed 410 mechanical wells, each with a water output of 40 to 120 cubic meters per hour. Hilly and mountainous areas that previously had difficulty even obtaining drinking water have now achieved water conservancy. The commune members happily said, "Gravity irrigation in the hills, no fear of drought or flood, people control the weather, bumper harvests are in our hands." Due to the reform of well-digging tools and the increasing depth of well-digging, "artesian wells" have emerged one after another. At present, 556 "artesian wells" have been completed throughout the province. The Qingtai Brigade of the Shezhen Commune in Nanyang County has completed four artesian wells 240 meters deep, with water jets reaching four meters above the ground. These wells have already irrigated more than 2,000 mu of land and stored 150,000 cubic meters of water. The masses said, "No need for machines or oxen, clear water flows all year round," greatly saving mechanical equipment and reducing the cost of irrigation. While engaging in a large-scale well-digging movement, the mechanical industry front is engaging in a large-scale production movement of drainage and irrigation machinery. More than 60,000 horsepower of various drainage and irrigation machinery have been manufactured. Commune machinery plants have manufactured a large number of low-pressure steam pumps, wooden water pumps, and converted Liberation-style waterwheels into powered waterwheels, creating a large number of water-lifting tools to support the mechanization and semi-mechanization of mechanical wells.

From last winter to mid-March of this year, more than 53,200 mechanical wells have been completed throughout the province, and more than 40,000 are under construction. After the completion of 100,000 mechanical wells, together with the previous well and spring projects, the area with "double insurance" for irrigation with both wells and canals can be expanded to 50 million mu, creating extremely favorable conditions for striving for a great agricultural harvest.

In the large-scale well-digging movement, our experience is:

First, adhere to putting politics in command, overcome right-leaning thinking, and launch a large-scale mass movement. This is the primary key to the well-digging movement. Building large-scale mechanical well squares is the demand of the masses, but at the beginning of the movement, a few cadres and masses did not fully recognize the importance of well-digging. In the self-flowing irrigation areas, there was the idea of "building canals and abandoning wells," saying that "canals are everywhere, and digging more wells is a waste." In the poorer hilly areas and some mountainous areas, they emphasized difficulties such as deep water tables and poor technology. In response to these ideological situations, various regions first widely publicized and implemented the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation. Through the methods of large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, and large-scale discussion, they summarized the experience of using groundwater in last year's large-scale drought resistance movement. Through recalling, comparing, and on-site visits, they cleared ideological obstacles and fully mobilized the masses, making the movement flourish. For example, the Dongcun People's Commune in Changge County built the Fo'ergang Reservoir in 1958, achieving self-flowing irrigation. However, in the drought resistance in 1959, the reservoir water was insufficient, and irrigation with well water resulted in a large autumn harvest of 846 jin per mu. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, the masses summarized this experience, greatly boosting their enthusiasm for well-digging. In the province's large-scale well-digging movement, Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead, focusing on mechanical well squares, tool reform, and command wells, leading well-digging by leading well-digging. Party committees and governments at all levels organized well-digging command centers, dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the construction sites, eating, living, working, and studying with the masses, strengthening leadership and inspiring the masses. For example, Ye County proposed "large squares encompassing small squares, each square must have a general, three wells for one secretary, each well must have a backbone." The secretaries worked with the masses and completed 618 mechanical wells. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses and strengthening leadership, a mass movement for large-scale well-digging was launched. Various regions held on-site meetings, skill competitions, and treasure-offering meetings, creating a great situation of vying to be the best, striving to be advanced, and learning from, catching up with, surpassing, and helping each other.

Second, mobilize the masses to engage in large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution. In order to solve the contradiction between the large task, the short time, and the shortage of labor, various regions prominently grasped the central link of technical innovation and technical revolution. Command centers at all levels organized technical innovation committees, and large brigades and construction sites established technical innovation groups, mobilized the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, engaged in large-scale creation and invention, summarized in a timely manner, and promoted in a timely manner, forming a mass technical innovation movement. Advanced tools and advanced construction methods emerged one after another with each passing day. The Dongcun People's Commune in Changge County, on the basis of the "Leap Forward Cone" in Haicheng County, successfully trial-produced the "Rocket Cone" and quickly promoted it throughout the province. Various regions further developed and improved it on this basis, and "Rocket Cone," "Atomic Cone," "Lightning Cone," "60 Red," and "Automatic Mud-Discharge Cone" adapted to various geological conditions emerged. In areas with quicksand and conglomerate layers, various advanced well-digging tools such as "Quicksand Tiger," "Rock-Crushing Device," "Stone-Grabbing Device," "Blasting Well-Digging Method," and "Universal Power Well-Digging Machine" were created, totaling more than 80 types. More than 10,000 sets of tools have been made, including manual, animal-powered, and mechanical types. These tools have the characteristics of low cost, simple structure, and high efficiency. In the past, it took 20 days to a month to complete a mechanical well. Now, it only takes three to five days, increasing efficiency by five to ten times. The daily progress of well-digging has rapidly increased from hundreds of wells to more than a thousand wells, greatly accelerating the progress of well-digging. Various regions have not only made many new improvements and creations in tools but also made great improvements in well-lining and brick-burning. Ren'dian and Fen'tai Communes in Xuchang created cylinder bricks, and Lin'ying created a small kiln for rapid brick-burning, which can burn a kiln of bricks in one day and one night. The Wa'dian People's Commune in Nanyang successfully tested the group kiln brick-burning method, making bricks as they were laid and burning them, breaking through the difficulty of not being able to burn bricks during the great freeze and ensuring a steady supply of bricks.

Third, mechanical well construction is a basic agricultural construction project. We must adhere to the principle of adapting to local conditions, combining with other projects, comprehensively planning, and rationally laying out mechanical wells, making them a complete water conservancy network. According to the experience of various regions, the planning of mechanical wells generally achieves a combination of six aspects, namely: (1) combining with the original canals in the canal irrigation area, trying to dig the mechanical wells at the head of the branch canals to reduce water transmission engineering and form a unified system of well and canal irrigation; (2) combining with the transformation of old wells, trying to use old wells to deepen them and save materials; (3) combining mechanical well squares with high-yield squares; (4) combining mechanical well positioning with groundwater flow direction, generally arranging them in rows, and the direction of the rows should be perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to prevent cutting off groundwater; (5) combining the location of mechanical wells with mechanized farming to facilitate future cultivation; (6) combining irrigation with comprehensive utilization of water sources and machinery to maximize the effectiveness of water sources and machinery and achieve multiple uses of water and multiple uses of machines. As for the density of mechanical wells, it is mainly determined based on the control area of mechanical wells, the water output, and the combination of agricultural canals and natural terrain. Generally, the well spacing is 500 meters, watering 400 mu of land, and installing a 5-horsepower water pump. This plan can vigorously develop groundwater resources, fully utilize surface water, and achieve "double insurance" for irrigation with both wells and canals.

Fourth, organize large-scale collaboration in accordance with the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange. In the well-digging movement, counties, communes, and teams widely carried out large-scale collaboration of tools, labor, and technical forces, adopting professional division of labor and assembly-line operations to solve many difficulties. The Tai Liu Management District of the Gongdian People's Commune in Ye County has seven brigades. The Tai Liu Brigade has carpenters, the Zhi Liu Brigade has blacksmiths, the Su Ke Brigade can weave mats, the Gongdian Brigade has machines, and other brigades have well-digging technicians. They jointly organized eight specialized teams, unified the use of manpower, materials, tools, and technology, and gave full play to their respective expertise. The entire management district completed 84 mechanical wells in half a month, realizing mechanical well-digging.

Fifth, urban support for rural areas and worker support for farmers greatly accelerated water conservancy construction. All departments in the province conducted education on developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, launching a movement to support agriculture and overcome drought. In addition to listing the manufacture of rocket cones and drainage and irrigation machinery as top priorities, various industrial and mechanical departments also sent 170,000 industrial workers to the fields to conduct mobile repairs, repairing more than 70,000 horsepower of power machinery, ensuring the normal operation of well-digging "rocket cones" and drainage and irrigation machinery, which was warmly welcomed by the commune members. Commercial departments actively organized sources of goods, giving priority to the supply of drought resistance and water conservancy materials to ensure the needs of the project. Cultural and health departments went deep into the construction sites, carried out cultural and entertainment activities to boost morale, and health and medical personnel provided mobile treatment to ensure the health of the workers. Therefore, the commune members excitedly said, "When our urban and rural forces unite, even the heavens will have to bow their heads."

Sixth, conscientiously implementing the policy of building and using at the same time is an effective measure to accelerate mechanical well construction and boost the morale of the masses. In carrying out the well-digging movement, we have implemented the principle of completing and using one well at a time, and promptly realizing the benefits. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses for well-digging has become greater and greater, and the movement has become wider and wider, promoting each other between the well-digging movement and the drought resistance and wheat watering movement.

The Henan water conservancy construction movement is advancing valiantly towards the goal of fundamentally eliminating water and drought disasters. We believe that the hardworking and brave people of Henan, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the close collaboration and strong support of fraternal provinces and cities throughout the country, will definitely be able to overcome water and drought disasters, and will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the 1960 agricultural production plan. Let us hold high the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and advance victoriously.

    划方打机井，丰收不靠天
    刘晏春代表谈河南人民大协作打机井的经验各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委所作的各项报告，并坚决贯彻执行。现在我仅就河南省大搞机井方的问题作如下发言。
    河南人民，在毛主席、党中央和国务院的正确领导下，水利建设已进入到全面开发，综合利用，大中小相结合的新阶段。在开发地下水方面，也由打井下泉、人畜力提水，发展到划片集中技术领导，大搞机井方。在1959年7月以来伟大的抗旱斗争中，许多地区由于地上水源的不足，大量地利用了地下水，取得了抗旱斗争的胜利，从而进一步开发利用地下水进行灌溉，就成为广大群众的迫切要求。中共河南省委根据这一情况，在去冬今春水利建设的计划中，除了积极修建其它工程之外，明确提出了1960年上半年打机井十万眼的任务。这一任务提出后，得到了广大社员的热烈欢迎，各地迅速地开展了打机井运动。南阳地区以南阳、唐河、新野、邓县四个县的十个人民公社，打破社界、县界，划为百万亩“机井方”，统一指挥，集中劳力一万八千人，规划机井二千二百多眼。采取了依靠群众，大搞群众运动，大兵团作战的方法，两个月完成二千九百三十四眼，并且随即投入浇地五十五万余亩，加上渠道的自流灌溉，已经完成了浇麦任务。达到了井渠灌溉“双保险”的水利化标准。群众总结划方打机井的好处是：一、不受行政区划限制，可以合理布局；二、便于加强领导及时总结交流经验；三、便于采取流水作业的施工方法，充分发挥工具效能；四、便于发挥群众智慧，大搞技术革命；五、便于集中生产、制造物料，就地使用。因此，河南省委、省人委及时召开了战地会议，推广这一先进经验。各地结合当地经验进行了重点试验之后，接着在全省范围内展开了划方打机井运动。全省到目前为止，共规划万亩、十万亩、几十万亩、几百万亩的大小“机井方”七百多处，面积达五千多万亩。组织打机井专业队三万多个，一百四十多万人，就地编席、就地烧砖、随打成井、随安装机器、随投入使用。在平原地区大搞机井方的同时，丘陵地区，也普遍展开了打机井运动。邙山岭上英雄的人民提出：“钻透邙山岭，引出地下泉，旱田有水浇，靠人不靠天”的口号，一个月以来，打成机井四百一十眼，每眼井每小时出水量在四十到一百二十立方米，以往连喝水都有困难的丘陵岗地实现了水利化。社员高兴地说：“岗地自流化（灌溉），旱涝都不怕，人掌风云簿，丰收咱当家。”由于打井工具的改革，打井深度日益发展，因而“自流井”相继出现，现在全省已打成“自流井”五百五十六眼。南阳县赊镇公社青台大队，打成了四眼二百四十米深的自流井，水头喷出地面四米高，现已浇地二千多亩，并蓄水十五万立方米。群众说：“不用机器不用牛，一年四季清水流”，大大节约了机械设备和降低了浇地成本。在大搞机井运动的同时，机械工业战线大搞排灌机械的生产运动，现已制造各种排灌机械六万多马力，各公社机械厂，大量制造了低压蒸气抽水机，木制水泵，改解放式水车为动力水车，为机井配套机械化、半机械化而创制了大量的提水工具。
    去冬以来到今年3月中旬，全省已打成机井五万三千二百多眼，正施工的还有四万多眼，十万眼机井完成后，连同以前的井泉工程，井渠灌溉“双保险”的面积，可以发展到五千万亩，为争取农业大丰收创造了极为有利的条件。
    在大打机井运动中，我们的体会是：
    一，坚持政治挂帅，克服右倾思想，大搞群众运动，这是打机井运动的首要关键。大搞机井方是广大群众的要求，但是运动开始的时候，有少数干部和群众，对打机井的重要性认识不足，在自流灌区有“兴渠废井”思想，说“遍地是渠道，再打机井是浪费”，条件较差的丘陵区和部分山区，强调水层深，技术差等困难。各地针对这些思想情况，首先广泛宣传贯彻了发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，通过大鸣大放大辩论的方式，总结了去年大搞抗旱运动利用地下水的经验。通过回忆对比实地参观，扫清了思想障碍，充分发动了群众，使运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。如长葛县董村人民公社，在1958年修起佛耳岗水库，实现了自流灌溉，但在1959年抗旱中库水不足，利用井水灌溉获得了亩产八百四十六斤的秋季大丰收。在公社党委领导下，群众性的总结了这一经验，大大鼓起了打机井的干劲。全省大搞机井运动中，各级党委书记挂帅，大抓机井方，大抓工具改革，大搞指挥井，以打井领导打井。各级党委、政府都组织了打井指挥部，抽调大批干部，深入工地，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究，加强了领导，鼓舞了群众。如叶县提出了“大方套小方，方方要有将，三井一书记，井井有骨干”，如各书记和群众在一起共打成机井六百一十八眼。在充分发动群众，加强领导的基础上，掀起了大搞机井的群众运动，各地召开了现场会、比武会、献宝会，出现了处处争上游，人人争先进，学、赶、超、帮的大好局面。
    二、发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命。为了解决任务大、时间短与劳力不足的矛盾，各地突出地抓住了技术革新和技术革命这一中心环节。各级指挥部组织了技术革新委员会，各大队、各工地建立了技术革新小组，发动群众提合理化建议，大搞创造发明，及时总结，及时推广，形成了群众性技术革新运动，先进工具，先进施工方法，日新月异，层出不穷。长葛县董村人民公社，在海城县“跃进锥”的基础上，试制成功“火箭锥”，并迅速推广到全省，各地在此基础上进一步的加以发展和改进，出现了适应各种地质条件的“火箭锥”“原子锥”“闪电锥”“六○红”“自动出泥锥”。在有流沙和?礓石层的地区，创造了“吞沙虎”“冲石器”“抓石器”“爆破打井法”和“万能动力打井机”等各种先进打井工具共八十余种，已制成工具达万余套，在种类上有人力的、畜力的、机械的等。这些工具都具有成本低，构造简单，工效高的特点。过去打成一眼机井需要二十天到一个月，现在三、五天就可以了。提高工效五到十倍。打机井日进度由百眼，迅速上升到一千多眼，大大加快了打机井的进度。各地不仅在工具上有了许多新的改进和创造，在圈井、烧砖方面也有很大改进。许昌任店、坟台公社创造了筒子砖，临颍创造了小窑快速烧砖法，一天一夜即可烧一窑砖；南阳瓦店人民公社试验成功群窑烧砖法，随打坯、随烧砖，突破了大冻期不能烧砖的难关，保证了砖料的源源供应。
    三、机井建设是农业基本建设工程。必须本着因地制宜，结合其他工程，全面规划，合理布局的原则，做好机井规划，使之成为一个完整的水利网。根据各地经验，在规划机井时一般做到了配套六结合，即：（1）在渠灌区与原来渠道相结合，尽量把机井打在斗农渠首以减少输水工程，形成井渠灌溉统一的体系；（2）与旧井改造相结合，尽量利用旧井加深，节省料物；（3）机井方与丰产方结合；（4）机井定位与地下水流向相结合，在一般情况下，尽量排列成行，行列方向要与地下水流向成垂直线，防止截断地下水；（5）机井位置要与机耕相结合，以便利将来耕作；（6）灌溉与综合利用水源、机械相结合，以发挥水源、机械的效能，达到一水多用、一机多用的目的。至于机井的密度，主要是根据机井控制面积、出水量，结合农渠和自然地形确定。一般井距为五百米，浇地四百亩，安装五马力抽水机，这样规划既能大力开发地下水源，又能充分利用地面水，实现井渠灌溉“双保险”。
    四、按照自愿互利和等价交换的原则，组织大协作。在打机井运动中，各县、社、队之间广泛的开展了工具、劳力和技术力量的大协作，采取专业分工，流水作业，解决了很多困难。叶县龚店人民公社台刘管理区共有七个大队，台刘大队有木匠，支刘大队有铁匠，苏科大队会编席，龚店大队有机器，其它大队有打井技工，他们共组织了八个专业队，把人力、物力、工具、技术统一使用，发挥各自的专长，全管理区半个月就完成机井八十四眼，实现了机井化。
    五、城市支援乡村，工人支援农民，大大的加速了水利建设。全省各部门都进行了发展国民经济以农业为基础的教育，掀起了支援农业，战胜干旱的运动，各个工业、机械部门，除了把制造火箭锥、排灌机械列为头等任务外，并派出了十七万工人大军，深入田间进行巡回修理，修好了动力机械七万多马力，保证了打井“火箭锥”和排灌机械的正常运转，得到广大社员热烈欢迎。商业部门积极组织货源，优先供应抗旱水利物资，保证工程需要。文化卫生部门深入工地，开展文化娱乐活动，鼓舞斗志，卫生医疗人员巡回治疗，保证职工健康。因此社员兴奋地说“咱们城乡力量合一起，老天胆敢不把头来低”。
    六、认真贯彻执行边建设、边使用的方针，是加速机井建设、鼓舞群众斗志的有效措施。我们在开展打机井运动中，贯彻执行了打成一眼、使用一眼，及时发挥了效益。因此，群众对打机井劲头越来越大，运动越来越广，使打机井运动与抗旱浇麦运动互相推动。
    河南水利建设运动，正在向着从根本上消灭水旱灾害的目标奋勇前进，我们相信，勤劳勇敢的河南人民，在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，在全国各兄弟省市的密切协作和有力支援下，一定能够战胜水旱灾害，一定能够完成和超额完成1960年农业生产计划。让我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗乘胜前进。
