We are workers in philosophy and social sciences, and studying Mao Zedong Thought is our primary task. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. With it, we have the correct direction and our work will be successful. Without it, we will lose our way and our work will fail. Chairman, fellow committee members:

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the Draft of the 1960 State Budget" summarize the achievements of the past and point out the direction for the future, presenting a magnificent and splendid picture before our eyes. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for the leadership of the Party. We are delighted and excited after hearing them, and we warmly endorse these two reports. We also agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report.

Each of us deeply feels that the two reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian concretely and vividly reflect the objective laws of our socialist revolution and socialist construction, and illustrate the great significance of the Party's leadership and the practice of the broad masses of working people in understanding objective laws and transforming the objective world. From beginning to end, they are imbued with Mao Zedong Thought. Through studying these two reports, we have further realized the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought.

We all know that in the revolutionary process of the past few decades, from the national democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, Chairman Mao combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, found the laws of the national liberation struggle in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and found the laws of developing from the victory of the democratic revolution to socialist transformation, that is, the socialist revolution, thereby greatly and creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought not only leads the Chinese people from one victory to another, but also has extremely important guiding significance for the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of our time, and it is a great contribution to the world communist movement.

At present, when the Chinese people have basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution and have also achieved great success in socialist construction, we further realize that Chairman Mao has greatly developed Marxism-Leninism. The reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian specifically and vividly illustrate this point.

It is not easy to explain in what aspects Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism. Because, first, Chairman Mao has made comprehensive and systematic creative developments of Marxism-Leninism in politics, economics, law, history, literature, art, language, philosophy, and even military affairs and diplomacy; second, Mao Zedong Thought is very broad and profound, and we study it every day and repeatedly, and the more we study it, the more we feel its richness and correctness. Now, we will only talk about some of our experiences on the following points.

The issues of productive forces and relations of production, economic base and superstructure, are key issues in historical materialism. Chairman Mao has made creative and significant contributions in this regard. He pointed out that the relationship between the two is always a relationship of unity of opposites and is always the driving force of social development. In socialist and communist societies, although the nature of the contradictions changes, the contradictory relationship still exists. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, constantly reforming the relations of production and the superstructure will open up broad avenues for the continuous development of productive forces. And the continuous development of productive forces forces the relations of production and the superstructure to undergo constant reform." Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report also emphasized this point. This is the theoretical basis for the theory of continuous revolution and the stages of revolutionary development.

As for which plays the main determining role between productive forces and relations of production, and between the economic base and the superstructure, Chairman Mao has made a clear and profound elucidation on this issue. He said: "It is true that productive forces, practice, and the economic base generally manifest themselves as playing the main determining role, and whoever does not recognize this is not a materialist. However, the relations of production, theory, and the superstructure, under certain conditions, in turn manifest themselves as playing the main determining role, and this must also be recognized." (On Contradiction) The revolutionary practice of China over the past few decades, especially the last ten years, has fully proven this point.

Chairman Mao highly emphasizes the Party's leadership and the thorough mass line. When the two are combined, the subjective initiative of the people can be greatly developed. However, some people in our country in the past made one-sided and mechanical explanations of production. They saw things but not people, and did not see the important role of the communist consciousness and moral qualities of the working people, thereby failing to fully estimate the subjective initiative of people. Chairman Mao fully recognized the power of the masses from revolutionary practice. He believed in the masses and was good at discovering new things from them. At any time and in any place, he paid attention to developing the potential of the people. He called on everyone to emancipate their minds and break down superstitions; the purpose was to develop the unparalleled and enormous potential of the people. Mao Zedong Thought is like a key that unlocks the potential of the Chinese people that has been locked up for a long time.

The vigorous movement of technical innovation and technical revolution that is now unfolding throughout the country is also sufficient to illustrate the great power of the mass line and the rich potential of the people. The people of the whole country responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, emancipating their minds and breaking down superstitions. Whether on the industrial and agricultural fronts, the transportation front, or the cultural, educational, and health fronts, countless miracles appear every day. Workers and peasants sing loudly:

Technical innovation is not difficult,
Emancipation of the mind is the key.
Hard work is Mount Tai,
Difficulties are eggs;
Eggs hitting Mount Tai,
Break upon contact.
How great is the enthusiasm of the masses! It is like a surging torrent that will break through all obstacles and create more miracles, through socialism, all the way to the most magnificent and brilliant ideal world of mankind—communism.

The law of unbalanced development is also an issue that Chairman Mao has emphasized for many years. For any movement of things, imbalance is absolute, while balance is only relative. The law of development of all things is from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance. This not only has great theoretical significance but also great practical significance. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "The national economy always experiences a process of development from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance, and each repetition raises the level of production by one step. The national economy is constantly developing forward in such a wave-like movement." This is the best explanation of the law of unbalanced development.

The above points are just some of our superficial experiences. We hope that fellow committee members will correct any errors in our understanding. As for the three magic weapons that specifically embody Mao Zedong Thought: the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, they are not only beacons illuminating the progress of our people and major achievements that inspire us, but also have had a significant and far-reaching impact internationally. Because the scope is very broad, we will not discuss them in detail here.

We are workers in philosophy and social sciences, and studying Mao Zedong Thought is our primary task. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. With it, we have the correct direction and our work will be successful. Without it, we will lose our way and our work will fail. The revolutionary practice of the past few decades has fully proven this point. We would like to propose three tasks here as a way for us to study Mao Zedong Thought:

First, under the leadership of the Party, through studying Mao Zedong Thought, we must continue to transform our thinking. In this great era of one day equaling twenty years, the changes in the objective world are rapid. We must constantly transform our subjective world to adapt to the development of the objective world. Therefore, the ideological transformation of intellectuals is long-term; in the transitional period, we can never say: we have transformed ourselves perfectly. There are many ways to transform, but, in our opinion, the most important key is to study Mao Zedong Thought with the spirit of combining theory with practice and diligent study, so as to gradually improve our theoretical level.

Second, the study of Mao Zedong Thought must be carried out in mass movements and in struggle. Mao Zedong Thought has developed in struggle, and we can only learn by personally throwing ourselves into mass movements and into struggle. For us, the most dangerous enemy at present is modern revisionism headed by the Yugoslav Tito clique, which echoes imperialism, confuses the public internationally, and attempts to undermine us and pave the way for capitalist restoration. We must learn to master Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely stand up, criticize modern revisionism, and thoroughly expose and defeat it. In addition, bourgeois academic thought must also be criticized, of course.

Third, while studying Mao Zedong Thought and fighting, we must also learn from the broad masses of working people on the one hand and do a good job in popularizing Mao Zedong Thought on the other hand. We all know Marx's famous saying: "Theory, once it seizes the masses, immediately becomes a material force." The revolutionary history of China over the past few decades has fully proven the correctness of this sentence. This is why the broad masses of the Chinese people are currently studying Mao Zedong Thought as eagerly as they are hungry and thirsty. We workers in philosophy and social sciences have a glorious task, which is to popularize Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of the people, so that this brilliant ideology is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We believe that the better the popularization work is done, the greater the enthusiasm of the people will be, the more potential will be developed, and the sooner socialism and communism will be realized.

The above three points are the tasks we should bear; however, we believe that they will have reference value for philosophy and social science workers nationwide. We sincerely hope that philosophy and social science workers across the country will work together, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and push the research and propaganda work of philosophy and social sciences to a new peak!

    把哲学社会科学的研究工作推向新高峰
    丁声树　王学文　陈岱孙　吴半农　吴德峰　吕振羽金岳霖　季羡林　范文澜　陶孟和　冯定　傅懋勣韩寿萱　委员的联合发言
    我们是哲学、社会科学工作者，学习毛泽东思想，是我们的首要任务。毛泽东思想是一切工作的指南针，有了它，就有了正确的方向，工作就有成绩；离开它，就会迷失方向，工作就失败。主席、各位委员：
    李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，总结了过去的成绩，指出了今后的方向，把一幅宏伟壮丽的图景展现在我们眼前。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，党的领导的胜利。我们听了以后，欢欣鼓舞，无比兴奋；我们热烈地拥护这两个报告。我们也同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告。
    我们每个人都深切地感觉到，李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两个报告具体生动地反映了我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设的客观规律，说明了党的领导和广大劳动人民的实践对于认识客观规律和改造客观世界的重大意义，自始至终都贯彻着毛泽东思想。通过对这两个报告的学习，我们又进一步体会到毛泽东思想的伟大与正确。
    我们大家都知道，在过去几十年的革命过程中，从民族民主革命一直到社会主义革命，毛主席把马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践结合起来，找到了殖民地半殖民地民族解放斗争的规律，找到了在民主革命胜利的基础上向社会主义改造即社会主义革命发展的规律，从而大大地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想不但把中国人民从一个胜利带向另一个胜利，而且对所有殖民地半殖民地国家的人民具有异常重大的指导意义。毛泽东思想就是当代的马列主义，对世界共产主义运动来说，它是一个极大的贡献。
    到了目前，当中国人民已经基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利、在社会主义建设中也已取得了极大的成绩的时候，我们更进一步体会到，毛主席又把马列主义大大地向前发展了。李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告就具体生动地说明了这一点。
    要想说明毛主席在哪些方面发展了马列主义，是十分不容易的。因为，第一，在政治、经济、法律、历史、文学、艺术、语言、哲学以至军事、外交等等方面，毛主席都对马列主义有全面系统的创造性的发展；第二，毛泽东思想是十分博大精深，我们天天学习，反复地学习，越学越感到它的丰富和正确。现在我们仅就以下几点，谈一下我们的一些体会。
    生产力与生产关系、经济基础与上层建筑的问题，是历史唯物主义中的关键问题。毛主席在这方面做出了有创造性的重大的贡献。他指出：两者的关系永远是对立统一的关系，永远是社会发展的动力。到了社会主义社会和共产主义社会，虽然矛盾的性质有所改变，但矛盾关系仍然存在着。李富春副总理在报告中说：“根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革。”李先念副总理的报告中也着重谈到这一点。这就是不断革命论与革命发展阶段论的理论基础。
    至于生产力与生产关系之间，经济基础与上层建筑之间，究竟哪一个起主要的决定的作用，毛主席对这个问题做了明确而深刻的阐明。他说：“诚然，生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者。然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用，这也是必须承认的。”（矛盾论）中国几十年来的、特别是最近十年来的革命实践充分地证明了这一点。
    毛主席十分强调党的领导和彻底的群众路线，两者结合起来，人们的主观能动性就能极大地发挥出来。但我国过去有一些人对生产做了片面的机械的解释，他们见物不见人，没有看到劳动人民的共产主义觉悟和道德品质的重要作用，从而没有充分估计人的主观能动性。毛主席从革命实践中充分认识了群众的力量，他相信群众，善于从中发现新生事物，在任何时候、任何地方，都注意发挥人民群众的潜力。他号召大家解放思想、破除迷信；目的就在于发挥人民的无比巨大的潜力。毛泽东思想真好像是一把钥匙，它开放了中国人民长期以来被封锁起来的潜力。
    现在在全国范围内展开的轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的运动，也足以说明群众路线威力之大，人民潜力蕴藏之富。全国人民响应了党和毛主席的号召，解放思想、破除迷信。不管是在工农战线上，交通运输战线上，还是在文教卫生的战线上，天天都出现无数的奇迹。工人农民高唱：
    技术革新并不难，思想解放是关键。
    干劲是泰山，困难是鸡蛋；
    鸡蛋碰泰山，一碰就完蛋。群众的干劲是多么大呀！它就像是一股奔腾澎湃的洪流，它将冲决一切障碍，创造出更多的奇迹，通过社会主义，一直冲向人类最伟大最光辉灿烂的理想世界——共产主义。
    不平衡发展规律也是毛主席多少年来就着重阐发的一个问题。对任何事物运动来说，不平衡都是绝对的，而平衡只是相对的。由不平衡到平衡再到不平衡就是一切事物发展的规律。这不但有重大的理论意义，也有重大的实践意义。李富春副总理在报告中说：“国民经济总是经历不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的发展过程，而每一次反复，也就把生产水平提高一步，国民经济就在这样的波浪式的运动中不断地向前发展。”这是对不平衡发展规律一个最好的说明。
    以上几点只是我们的一些粗浅的体会。体会错误的地方，希望各位委员指正。至于具体体现毛泽东思想的三大法宝：总路线、大跃进和人民公社，不但是照耀我国人民前进的灯塔和令我们欢欣鼓舞的重大成就，而且在国际上也起了重大而深远的影响。因为范围很广，我们在这里就不再细谈。
    我们是哲学、社会科学工作者，学习毛泽东思想是我们的首要任务。毛泽东思想是一切工作的指南针，有了它，就有了正确的方向，工作就有成绩；离开它，就会迷失方向，工作就失败。几十年来的革命实践充分证明了这一点。我们想在这里提出三方面的任务，做为我们学习毛泽东思想的途径：
    第一、在党的领导下，通过学习毛泽东思想，继续改造我们的思想。在这一天等于二十年的伟大时代里，客观世界的变化一日千里。我们必须随时改造我们的主观世界，以与客观世界的发展相适应。因此，知识分子的思想改造是长期的；在过渡时期我们什么时候也不能说：我们已经改造得十全十美了。改造的方式是多种多样的，但是，据我们看，其中最重要的关键，就是用理论联系实际、刻苦钻研的精神学习毛泽东思想，这样才能逐步提高我们的理论水平。
    第二、学习毛泽东思想必须在群众运动中、在战斗中进行。毛泽东思想是在战斗中发展起来的，也只有我们自己亲身投入群众运动中投入战斗中才能学习。对我们来说，当前最危险的敌人就是以南斯拉夫铁托集团为首的现代修正主义，它与帝国主义相呼应，在国际上混淆视听，企图把我们搞垮，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。我们必须学习掌握毛泽东思想这个武器，坚决站起来，批判现代修正主义，把它彻底揭穿、打垮。此外，资产阶级的学术思想，当然也必须加以批判。
    第三、在学习毛泽东思想和战斗的同时，我们还必须一面向广大的劳动人民学习，一面做好普及毛泽东思想的工作。我们都知道马克思的那一句名言：“理论只要一掌握群众，就立刻成为物质的力量。”中国过去几十年的革命历史充分地证明了这一句话的正确性。这也就是为什么目前中国广大的人民群众如饿如渴地学习毛泽东思想的原因。我们哲学社会科学工作者有一个光荣的任务，就是，在广大人民群众中普及毛泽东思想，使这种光辉灿烂的思想家喻户晓，深入人心。我们相信，普及工作做得愈好，人民群众的干劲也就愈大，潜力发挥得也就愈多，社会主义共产主义实现得也就愈早。
    以上三点是我们应负的任务；但是，我们相信，它们对全国的哲学社会科学工作者会有参考价值。我们热诚地希望全国的哲学社会科学工作者共同努力，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，把哲学社会科学的研究工作与宣传工作推向一个新的高峰！
