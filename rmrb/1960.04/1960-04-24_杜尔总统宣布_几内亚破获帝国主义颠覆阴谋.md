    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 21st: Guinean President Sékou Touré announced at a press conference on April 21st that the Guinean government had uncovered a subversive plot orchestrated by imperialists, aimed at inciting armed rebellion to overthrow the young republic's government.

    Touré said that the Guinean government had arrested the head of the subversive organization and some of its members, seized the organization's activity funds received from abroad, and confiscated one million leaflets.

    Touré said that this vast subversive organization had set up radio transmitters and receivers in various places, eavesdropped on the phone calls of government leaders, and that someone had transported troops from the Ivory Coast into Guinea. He said that the imperialists attempted to recruit five thousand people in Guinea specifically for subversive activities.

    He said that, in addition, military camps had been established in neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast (both members of the French Community) to Guinea, and that there were plans on May 25th to send aircraft to fly over Guinea and distribute leaflets calling on some officers and residents to launch a rebellion.

    President Touré finally emphasized that since Guinea gained independence, foreign imperialists have not laid down their arms. They are trying to strangle our young republic through all kinds of conspiracies. We are confident that these conspiracies will never succeed, and I warn these adventurers that they will be defeated.

    Currently, mass rallies are being held throughout Guinea. The people have risen to take action to resolutely defend the republic.

    杜尔总统宣布
    几内亚破获帝国主义颠覆阴谋
    新华社科纳克里21日电　几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔21日在一次记者招待会上宣布，几内亚政府已经破获了一个由帝国主义者策动的、目的在于煽起武装叛乱来推翻这个年青共和国政府的颠覆阴谋。
    杜尔说，几内亚政府已经逮捕了这个颠覆组织的负责人和一部分成员，查获了这个组织从国外收到的活动基金、并且没收了一百万张传单。
    杜尔说，这个庞大的颠覆组织在各地设置了无线电发报机和收报机，偷听政府领导人的电话，并且有人把军队从象牙海岸运入几内亚。他说，帝国主义者企图在几内亚收罗五千名专门从事颠覆活动的人。
    他说，此外，在几内亚邻近的塞内加尔和象牙海岸（均为法兰西共同体成员）还建立了军营，并且计划在5月25日出动飞机飞临几内亚上空散发要若干军官和居民发动叛乱的传单。
    杜尔总统最后强调指出，自从几内亚获得独立以来，外国帝国主义者没有放下武器。他们试图通过各式各样的阴谋手段来扼杀我们的年青共和国。我们确信，这种阴谋是决不会得逞的，而且我要警告这些冒险家们，他们定将被击败。
    目前，几内亚全国各地纷纷举行群众大会。人民已经起来采取行动，坚决保卫共和国。
