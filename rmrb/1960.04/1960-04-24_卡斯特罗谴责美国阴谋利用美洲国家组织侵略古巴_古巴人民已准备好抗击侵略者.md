Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 23rd: Cuban Prime Minister Castro, in a television broadcast early this morning, accused the United States government of plotting to use the Organization of American States to invade Cuba.

Speaking of the recent armed rebellion in Venezuela, Castro pointed out that in addition to attempting to destroy Venezuelan democracy, the rebellion also sought to establish a ring of encirclement against Cuba, so as to facilitate the enemies of the revolution in launching an invasion of Cuba.

Castro emphasized the decisive role played by the Venezuelan people in suppressing the rebellion. He pointed out that the Cuban government's proposal to the Venezuelan government to provide weapons and personnel to assist in suppressing the military rebellion reflected the wishes of the Cuban people, and this proposal would remain valid in the future if necessary.

Prime Minister Castro refuted the crude attacks made by Eisenhower in a reply to the Chilean Student Union on him and other leaders of the Cuban revolutionary government. In this letter, Eisenhower attacked them for "betraying" the "ideals" of the Cuban revolution. Castro reminded people that the problems between the Cuban revolutionary government and the United States arose precisely because the Cuban government was loyal to the revolution. He emphasized that if the revolutionary government had betrayed the revolution, then Eisenhower would have called it a loyal friend. However, the revolutionary government lowered the fees previously charged by the American Electric Power Company and the Telephone Company in Cuba, recovered sovereignty, did not succumb to foreign monopoly groups, and instead of leaving the large estates of foreign companies intact, carried out land reform, already handing over eighty thousand caballerías of sugarcane fields to agricultural workers.

Prime Minister Castro said that if the situation in Cuba remained the same as before after millions of Cubans had shed blood in the struggle against dictatorial rule, Eisenhower would have supported Cuba as he did Franco. However, the revolutionary government did not let the martyrs shed their blood in vain. On the contrary, the millions of people who sacrificed themselves in the anti-fascist last world war—including millions of Americans—and those who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against fascism in Spain, which was supported by Hitler and Mussolini, can indeed feel that the policies pursued by the United States betrayed them.

Castro accused that "the propaganda methods used by the United States against Cuba are (Hitler's) Goebbels-style methods."

Castro condemned the counter-revolutionaries in Oriente Province and the soldiers of the former dictatorial regime, who are operating in American bases, colluding with those counter-revolutionaries, attempting to form a center for counter-revolutionary armed rebellion. He said that armed peasants in Oriente Province have begun to pursue the sixteen bandits, led by the counter-revolutionary Manuel Beatón, who are active in the mountainous areas, and have captured five of them. He affirmed that all the bandits would be captured in the near future.

Castro pointed out that while this group of bandits was carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, American Guantanamo base aircraft were flying over the areas where this group of bandits was active, thereby violating Cuban airspace. He said that in the face of American aggression plans, the Cuban people have prepared themselves to resist any aggressors who invade Cuban territory. He said: Now, here, Cuban laws treat Cubans and foreigners equally, and there are no longer people who enjoy privileges.

    卡斯特罗谴责美国阴谋利用美洲国家组织侵略古巴
    古巴人民已准备好抗击侵略者
    据新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天清晨在电视广播中，指责美国政府正在策划利用美洲国家组织来侵略古巴。
    谈到最近在委内瑞拉发生的武装叛乱时，卡斯特罗指出，这次叛乱除了企图摧毁委内瑞拉的民主以外，还企图建立一个反对古巴的包围圈，以便于革命的敌人发动对古巴的侵略。
    卡斯特罗强调指出委内瑞拉人民群众在镇压叛乱中所起的决定性作用。他指出，古巴政府向委内瑞拉政府提出的提供武器和人员以协助镇压军事叛乱的建议反映了古巴人民的愿望，这个建议日后在必要时将仍然有效。
    卡斯特罗总理反驳了艾森豪威尔在写给智利学生联合会的复信中对他和古巴革命政府其他领导人进行的粗暴攻击。艾森豪威尔在这封信中攻击他们“背叛”了古巴革命的“理想”。卡斯特罗提醒人们注意：古巴革命政府同美国之间的问题恰恰是由于古巴政府忠于革命而发生的。他强调说，假如革命政府背叛了革命，那末艾森豪威尔就要把它称为忠实的朋友了。但是，革命政府压低了在古巴的美国电力公司和电话公司过去所收的费用，收回了主权，不屈服于外国垄断集团，非但没有原封不动地保留外国公司的大庄园，反而进行了土地改革，已经把八万卡瓦耶里亚的甘蔗园交给了农业工人。
    卡斯特罗总理说，在千千万万古巴人在反对独裁统治的斗争中付出了鲜血以后，假如古巴的局势仍旧和以前一样的话，艾森豪威尔就会像对佛朗哥一样地拥护古巴了。但是，革命政府并没有使烈士们白白流血牺牲。与此相反，在反法西斯的上次世界大战中牺牲的千百万人——其中有千千万万的美国人——和那些在西班牙反对由希特勒和墨索里尼扶上台的法西斯主义的斗争中牺牲的人们倒的确可以感到，美国所执行的政策背叛了他们。
    卡斯特罗指责“美国用来反对古巴的宣传方法是（希特勒的）戈培尔式的方法”。
    卡斯特罗谴责了奥连特省的反革命分子和前独裁政权的军人，这些军人在美国的基地进行活动，同那些反革命分子勾结一起，企图形成一个反革命武装叛乱的中心。他说，奥连特省的武装农民已经开始追捕在山区活动的、由反革命分子曼努埃尔·贝亚顿带领的十六名匪徒，并且捕获了其中的五名。他肯定说，所有的匪徒都将在短期内就擒。
    卡斯特罗指出，在这批匪徒进行反革命活动的同时，美国关塔那摩基地的飞机在这批匪徒活动的地区飞行，从而侵犯了古巴的领空。他说，面对美国的侵略计划，古巴人民已经作好准备，以便抵抗任何侵犯古巴领土的侵略者。他说：现在，在这里，古巴的法律对古巴人和外国人是同等对待的，已经没有享受特权的人了。
