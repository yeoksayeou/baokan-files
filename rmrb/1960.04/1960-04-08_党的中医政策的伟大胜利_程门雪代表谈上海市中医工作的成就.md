Comrades,

Today, at this inspiring and historically significant conference, I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. As a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), I would like to share some insights on the achievements of TCM work in Shanghai.

**The Policy on TCM is Increasingly Rooted in People's Hearts, and Unity and Cooperation Between TCM and Western Medicine Have Been Further Strengthened**

In recent years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, and under the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Shanghai's TCM work has earnestly implemented the TCM policy and achieved great success. All twelve districts and eleven counties in the city have established apprenticeship classes, with collective teaching and decentralized practice, exchanging experiences with each other. After being educated by the Party and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the political consciousness of TCM workers has been greatly enhanced. At the same time, Western medicine practitioners have also made great progress in learning TCM, with a tenfold increase in the number of people studying while working. Many medical personnel are seriously studying and delving into traditional Chinese medicine, and the TCM policy is increasingly rooted in people's hearts. The unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine have been further strengthened; mutual learning and mutual assistance have become a new trend. In clinical teaching and medical scientific research, TCM and Western medicine practitioners consult together. Western medicine practitioners actively study TCM theories and clinical experience, and many TCM practitioners also attach importance to learning modern medical knowledge, making certain contributions to disease prevention and treatment, and solving difficult cases. For example, hypertension is a relatively stubborn disease, and there is no definite method for consolidating the curative effect. The Shanghai Institute of Hypertension has adopted a comprehensive treatment method combining TCM and Western medicine, acupuncture, and qigong, which has achieved remarkable results. There has also been some development in the theory of the pathogenesis of hypertension. Based on the TCM theory of Yin and Yang, combined with Pavlov's theory, a new viewpoint of "bodily imbalance" has been proposed. Another example is acupuncture treatment of appendicitis, which saves many patients from the pain of surgery. The effectiveness of acupuncture in treating deafness and muteness, as well as the achievements of acupuncture anesthesia, have also been improved. Since the National Conference on Meridians and Acupuncture convened by the Ministry of Health in Shanghai last year, medical personnel in Shanghai have more enthusiastically launched research on the mechanisms of meridians and clinical research, and have achieved certain results. For example, the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Shanghai Institute of Acupuncture have conducted research on the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment of infantile paralysis, and other medical units have conducted research on the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture treatment of inflammation, and have initially explored some patterns. At the same time, the method of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment has been widely applied in clinical treatment and research by the city's medical community, and significant results have been achieved in the treatment of several quite stubborn diseases using the method of syndrome differentiation and treatment. It is worth mentioning that Chinese and Western medicine doctors from the First Medical College, the Second Medical College, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Xuhui Hospital treat late-stage schistosomiasis, using TCM theory with the main focus on promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, flexibly applying it according to syndrome differentiation and treatment, and using Western medicine to treat ascites, with a curative effect of over 95%. Under the guidance of the Party, with the great collaboration of TCM and Western medicine and great collaboration within TCM, this strong fortress that seriously endangers people's health has been breached in a very short course of treatment. Some diseases that were previously considered difficult to treat have been resolved through integrated TCM and Western medicine treatment. For example, the treatment of chronic nephritis and azotemia at the Shuguang Hospital (formerly the Eleventh People's Hospital) using syndrome differentiation and treatment has also seen a significant increase in efficacy compared to last year. These examples are new achievements in applying TCM theory to clinical treatment, which provide important clues for elucidating the theory of meridians and the entire TCM academic system, and gradually create conditions for the establishment of a new school of medicine. Recently, we established a "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment Research Group," gathering TCM and Western medicine doctors from the city to jointly conduct research on syndrome differentiation and treatment, applying syndrome differentiation and treatment methods from various diseases to find patterns, analyze characteristics, and explore principles, to further improve the theoretical level of TCM.

**The Integrated Treatment of TCM and Western Medicine is Applied to a Wide Range of Diseases, Achieving Great Results**

The integrated treatment of TCM and Western medicine is applied to a wide range of diseases in clinical treatment, achieving great results. In addition to late-stage schistosomiasis and hypertension, good results have also been achieved in infectious hepatitis, tuberculosis, asthma, and the rescue of critically ill patients. These glorious achievements are the crystallization of the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, the result of sorting out and studying China's medical heritage with modern scientific methods, the great victory of the Party's TCM policy, and the victory of the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao attach great importance to the cultural heritage of the motherland, and instructed us to inherit and develop traditional Chinese medicine. As early as 1950, Chairman Mao gave the instruction to "unite the old and new, TCM and Western medicine, all medical and health workers, to form a solid and unified front, and strive to carry out the great people's health work." In November 1958, the CPC Central Committee pointed out: Chinese medicine is a great treasure house, and we must continue to work hard to explore and improve it. This is a major event that cannot be taken lightly. On January 25, 1959, the "People's Daily" published an editorial "Earnestly Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," which further clarified the great call to sort out China's medical heritage with modern scientific methods and create China's original school of medicine. Years of practical work have made us deeply realize that these instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are extremely wise and correct. TCM work, like other work, must follow the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought, proceed from the actual needs of the 600 million people, proceed from the laws of scientific development, and TCM and Western medicine must unite closely, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, in order to achieve victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the Chinese revolution and construction. In the process of inheriting and developing traditional Chinese medicine and creating a new school of medicine, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and move forward.

**Sorting Out the Heritage of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Creating a New School of Medicine Must Rely on the Leadership of the Party and Adhere to Putting Politics in Command**

To do a good job in researching and sorting out the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, to raise it to the level of modern science, and to create the glorious task of a new school of medicine with originality, we must rely closely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and fight against various erroneous ideas. In carrying out TCM work, we must oppose both the national nihilist ideology of underestimating and discriminating against TCM, and overcome the conservative ideology of following old ways and sticking to old habits. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, since 1955, our TCM work in Shanghai has resolutely criticized and corrected the ideology of underestimating and discriminating against TCM and the sectarian approach to TCM, so that the Party's TCM policy has been deeply implemented. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine is a heritage left by our ancestors, and we must also correctly use the dialectical materialist viewpoint and modern scientific methods to sort it out and develop it. For example, to elaborate on theories and improve curative effects, we must start with integrating TCM and Western medicine and technological innovation, so that traditional Chinese medicine can better serve the health of the working people.

In my personal experience, the Party's TCM policy is entirely based on safeguarding the health of the 600 million people. The basic principles of all our TCM work should proceed from the Party's TCM policy, and strive towards a direction that is more conducive to people's health and more conducive to production; strengthen the integration of TCM and Western medicine, and accelerate the creation of a new school of medicine. Therefore, we must, under the leadership of the Party, earnestly implement the Party's General Line and various policies and guidelines, strengthen self-transformation, continuously improve our awareness, continue to correct and overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas and erroneous viewpoints that violate the spirit of the General Line, and establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. In our work, we must implement the Party's mass line and vigorously launch mass movements. The development of the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine over the past four years has proved that if we follow the mass line and launch mass movements in everything, we can meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Although Shanghai's TCM work has made great progress and achieved success in recent years, there is still a gap from the requirements of the Great Leap Forward situation. In the future, we must work hard to study Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, continuously improve our political and theoretical level, establish a dialectical materialist proletarian worldview, emancipate our minds, and strive for the top. We must have the ambition to create a new school of medicine, strengthen the unity of TCM and Western medicine, vigorously launch mass movements, adhere to putting politics in command, and make a major contribution to achieving this great goal and developing medical science.

    党的中医政策的伟大胜利
    程门雪代表谈上海市中医工作的成就各位代表：
    今天，在这个振奋人心，有伟大历史意义的大会上，我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告。我是一个中医工作者，我想就上海市在中医工作方面取得的成就，谈几点体会。
    中医政策越来越深入人心，中西医的团结合作，有了进一步的加强
    几年来，上海的中医工作，在毛泽东思想的指导下，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在上海市市委的正确领导下，认真贯彻中医政策，取得了很大的成绩。全市十二个区十一个县，都成立了带徒班，集体教学分散实习，互相交流经验。中医工作人员经过党的教育和大跃进形势鼓舞，政治觉悟大大提高；同时西医学习中医，也有很大的进展，过去在职学习的人数成十倍的增加。许多医务人员都认真学习和钻研祖国医学，中医政策越来越深入人心。中西医的团结合作，有了进一步的加强；相互学习，相互帮助，已成为一种新的风气。在临床教学和医学科学研究工作中，中西医共同磋商。西医主动钻研中医理论和临床经验，许多中医也重视学习现代医学知识，为防治疾病，解决疑难病例作出了一定的贡献。举例来说，像高血压症是一种比较顽固的疾病，在巩固疗效上还没有一定的办法，上海市高血压研究所采取了中西医药、针灸及气功相结合的综合疗法，已取得显著的效果。在高血压发病机制的理论上，也有所发展，根据中医阴阳学说，结合巴甫洛夫学说，提出了“机体不平衡”的新观点。又如针刺治疗阑尾炎，使许多患者避免了施行手术的痛苦；针灸治疗聋哑的有效率以及针刺代替麻醉的成就等等，都有所提高。在卫生部去年在上海召开的全国经络、针灸会议以后，上海市的医务人员都更加热烈地展开了经络的机制和临床研究工作，并已取得了一定的成就。如上海中医学院及上海市针灸研究所对针刺治疗小儿麻痹症的机制研究，及其他医疗单位对针刺治疗炎症的镇痛、消炎作用的机制研究，都已初步摸索出了一些规律。同时，对中医辨症论治的方法，也由全市医务界广泛地运用于临床治疗和进行研究，有几种相当顽固的疾患施用了辨症论治方法以后，得到了显著成绩。值得提出的，如一医、二医、中医三个学院和徐汇医院的中西医师治疗晚期血吸虫病，运用中医理论以化瘀通络为主，根据辨症论治灵活运用，并配合西药来治疗大腹水，疗效达95％以上。在党的指导下，中西医大协作，中医大协作，这个严重危害人民健康的坚强堡垒，在很短的疗程内已经被攻破了，过去认为很难治的，有的通过中西综合治疗，而已得到了解决；又如曙光医院（即以前十一人民医院）治疗慢性肾炎氮血症，运用辨症论治方法，疗效也比去年有很大程度的提高。这些例子，都是运用中医理论于临床治疗的新的成就，它对阐明经络学说和整个中医学术方面提供了重要线索，并为创立新医学派逐步创造条件。最近，我们成立了“辨症论治研究组”，聚集全市的中医师和西医师们来共同进行辨症论治的研究，从各种不同的病种中应用辨症论治方法来寻找规律，分析特点，探求原理，进一步提高中医的理论水平。
    采用中西医结合的综合治疗，应用的病种范围很广，取得的成果很大
    在临床治疗上采用中西结合的综合治疗，应用的病种范围很广，取得的成果很大，除晚期血吸虫病、高血压以外，如传染性肝炎、肺结核、哮喘及抢救危急病人方面都有很好疗效。这些光辉的成就，是中西医团结合作的结晶，是用现代科学方法整理研究我国医学遗产的成果，是党的中医政策的伟大胜利，也是毛泽东思想光辉照耀的胜利。
    党中央和毛主席非常重视祖国的文化遗产，指示我们要继承、发扬祖国医学。早在1950年，毛主席就作了“团结新老中西医各部分医药卫生工作人员，组成巩固的统一战线，为开展伟大的人民卫生工作而奋斗”的指示。中共中央于1958年11月又指出了：中国医学是一个伟大的宝库，必须继续努力发掘，并加以提高，这是一件大事，不可等闲视之。1959年1月25日“人民日报”又发表了“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论，进一步明确地提出了用现代科学方法整理我国医学遗产，创造我国独创性的医药学派的伟大号召。几年来的工作实践，使我们深刻体会到，党中央和毛主席的这些指示是非常英明正确。中医工作也和其他工作一样，必须遵循毛主席的思想指导，从六亿人民的实际需要出发，从科学的发展规律出发，中西医紧密团结，取长补短，才能取得胜利。毛泽东思想是中国革命和建设的指导思想，在继承和发扬祖国医学、创立新的医药学派的过程中，我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗向前迈进。
    整理祖国医学遗产，创立新医学派必须依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅
    要做好研究、整理祖国医学遗产的工作，把它提高到现代科学水平，创立具有独创性的新医学派的光荣任务，必须紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，向各种错误思想进行斗争。在开展中医工作中，既要反对轻视、歧视中医的民族虚无主义思想，也要克服因循守旧、故步自封的保守思想。我们上海的中医工作，由于市委的正确领导，1955年以来，坚决批判和纠正了轻视、歧视中医的思想和对待中医的宗派主义作法，使党的中医政策得到了深入贯彻；另一方面，祖国医学是我国祖先传留下来的遗产，也必须正确地运用辩证唯物的观点和现代科学方法加以整理和发扬。如阐发理论，提高疗效，都必须从融会中西、技术革新着手，这样才能使祖国医药更好地为劳动人民的健康服务。
    个人的体会，党的中医政策，完全从保障六亿人民的健康出发的，我们中医一切工作的基本原则：应该从党的中医政策出发，朝着更有利于人民健康和有利于生产的方向努力；加强中西医结合，加速创立新的医药学派。因此，我们必须在党的领导下，认真贯彻党的总路线和各项政策方针，加强自我改造，不断地提高觉悟，继续纠正和克服各种违反总路线精神的右倾保守思想及错误观点，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。在工作中，必须贯彻党的群众路线，大搞群众运动。我们上海中医学院四年来的发展证明了，凡事走了群众路线，搞了群众运动，就能达到多快好省的要求。
    几年来上海的中医工作，虽然有了很大进展，获得了成就，但是从大跃进的形势要求来看，还存在着距离。今后必须努力学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，不断地提高我们的政治理论水平，树立辩证唯物的无产阶级世界观，解放思想，力争上游；要有创造新的医药学派的雄心壮志，加强中西医团结，大搞群众运动，坚持政治挂帅，为实现这个伟大的目标，发展医学科学作出重大贡献。
