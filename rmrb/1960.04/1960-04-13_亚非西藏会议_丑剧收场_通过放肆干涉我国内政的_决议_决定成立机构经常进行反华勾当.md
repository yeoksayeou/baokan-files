Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from New Delhi: The so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet and Anti-Colonialism Conference," a farce aimed at poisoning the atmosphere of the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and obstructing the two countries from reasonably resolving border issues through friendly consultation, was staged in New Delhi for three days under the auspices of a handful of notorious reactionary elements in India, and hastily ended on the evening of the 11th.

At the close of the conference, two participants from Kenya indignantly left the venue, strongly protesting that the conference's resolutions did not represent the true demands of the Afro-Asian people. One of them, Oyangji, pointed out that the conference did not condemn the atrocities and massacres of Western imperialist countries in Algeria and Africa, but instead tried to curry favor with them.

The conference passed some "resolutions" that wantonly interfered in China's internal affairs. In these so-called "resolutions," they rehashed long-bankrupt slanders against China, tried their best to embolden Tibetan rebels, clamored for the "independence" of Tibet—an inseparable part of China's territory—and demanded the establishment of a "Standing Council" to help Tibetan rebels collect intelligence from Tibet and steal Tibetan historical and artistic treasures. The conference also decided to plot to bring the so-called "Tibetan issue" to the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs through the United Nations. They also decided to establish a so-called "Standing Afro-Asian Council" and establish "committees" in their respective countries to prepare to regularly engage in despicable anti-China activities.

    “亚非西藏会议”丑剧收场
    通过放肆干涉我国内政的“决议”  决定成立机构经常进行反华勾当
    新华社12日讯　新德里消息：为了毒化中印两国总理会晤的气氛、阻挠两国通过友好协商合理解决边界问题的所谓“亚非西藏和反殖民主义会议”丑剧，在印度一小撮臭名远扬的反动分子主持下在新德里上演了三天，于11日晚间草草收场。
    会议闭幕时，有两名来自怯尼亚的参加者忿然离开会场，强烈抗议会议的决议不代表亚非人民的真正要求。其中一人奥扬吉指出，会议没有指责西方帝国主义国家在阿尔及利亚和非洲的暴行和屠杀，相反地却只是向它们讨好。
    会议通过了一些放肆干涉中国内政的“决议”。在这些所谓“决议”中，重弹早已破产的诽谤中国的谰言，竭力为西藏叛乱分子打气，叫嚷要中国不可分割的领土——西藏“独立”，并且要求建立一个“常设理事会”来帮助西藏叛乱分子收集来自西藏的情报，窃取西藏的历史和艺术宝藏。会议并且决定策划把所谓“西藏问题”提到联合国去，通过联合国干涉中国内政。他们还决定建立一个所谓“常设亚非理事会”，在各自的国家中建立“委员会”准备经常地进行反华的卑鄙勾当。
