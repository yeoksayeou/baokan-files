Comrades Chairman, Committee Members, and Deputies:

We fully agree with the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee presented by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and we wholeheartedly support the report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960 by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the report by Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin on "Striving to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule."

The current excellent situation in our domestic economy and politics is conducive to realizing a better, more comprehensive, and sustained leap forward. Sichuan is as good as the rest of the country. The agricultural production movement launched throughout the province this year has created a new situation of comprehensive and sustained leap forward with one heart, one mind, and one appearance. The formation of this new situation is the result of the correct leadership of the Party, the shining light of the General Line, the victorious foundation of successive years of the Great Leap Forward, and the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes. On the other hand, it is inseparable from the great improvement of the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of farmers, the substantial increase in production income, the increasingly better life, and the increasing enthusiasm. Under this series of excellent circumstances, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China timely issued the call in February this year for "the whole Party and the whole people to be of one heart, one mind, and one appearance to achieve a comprehensive and sustained leap forward." This call has decisive significance for the current high tide of the continuous Great Leap Forward movement being carried out by the broad masses of farmers in Sichuan Province on the production front.

During our inspection in Sichuan, we visited Jianyang, Ziyang, Lezhi, Suining, Zhongjiang and other counties. In addition to general inspections, we also conducted key inspections. Our deepest impression is that the broad masses of farmers, under the leadership of the Party, have formed a torrent of comprehensive and sustained Great Leap Forward with the whole Party and the whole people of one heart, one mind, and one appearance. At the same time, this torrent is also poured down to every commune, every team, every household, every person, and every kind of work, achieving practical implementation in everything, for everyone, and all the way to the bottom. They have established ambitious goals in production planning; adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously carried out mass movements, implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations; actively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture"; vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, greatly improving labor productivity. During our inspection, they were strengthening the field management of the minor spring crops and preparing for spring plowing and sowing. According to what we saw, the minor spring crops are growing very luxuriantly this year, with uniform seedlings. A bumper harvest can already be affirmed. Everywhere we went, we saw a vibrant atmosphere, a roaring hot tide, forming a new Great Leap Forward momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, advancing a thousand miles a day.

They have established ambitious goals in production planning and set active and reliable targets. Jianyang is carrying out large-scale cotton production increase, Lezhi wants to realize "half a year's grain from minor spring crops"; Zhongjiang put forward the bold slogan of "completing ten years' worth of work in one year." In terms of yield per unit area, Lezhi is a hilly area with not very good natural conditions, but this year they want to "realize great targets of thousands and millions," that is: achieve a yield of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, 100 jin of cotton per mu, 100 jin of silkworm cocoons per sheet, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. All counties have put forward the slogan of "learning from Lezhi, catching up with Lezhi." Ziyang wants to achieve a large-scale yield of 1,000 jin of peanuts per mu, and strive for a yield of 2,000 jin per mu in command fields. Jianyang wants to achieve a large-scale yield of 160 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and a yield of 1,000 jin per mu in command fields. These all show that they are wholeheartedly establishing high-yield thinking.

In accordance with the principle of proportionate development of the national economy, all counties adhere to the principle of "taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, combining priority development of heavy industry with rapid development of agriculture," and implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations." In addition to greatly developing grain crops, all counties are vigorously developing diversified operations in combination with their specific conditions and characteristics. Jianyang County is developing "both guaranteeing key points (grain) and guaranteeing characteristics (cotton)," and also engaging in other diversified operations; Ziyang County, in addition to grain, is planting peanuts, citrus, and Alisma orientalis (Chinese medicine), and developing poultry. Now, there is an average of ten poultry per person, and in individual cases, such as the Lujia Commune, it has reached thirty per person; Lezhi County planted 40 million mulberry trees, and on the basis of raising 5,700 silkworms last year, silkworm raising has been developed to 20,000 sheets this year, and a new automated silk reeling factory has been established, and is preparing to greatly develop silk. Now, while developing diversified operations, all counties are also greatly developing pig raising, setting off a mass pig raising upsurge. Jianyang is preparing to develop 1.2 million live pigs this year, and the heaviest fattened pig currently raised has reached 965 jin. In order to greatly develop live pigs, all counties are paying attention to developing sows. There is a pig farm in Jiexing Commune in Zhongjiang, which produces nine litters a day, with a total of 123 piglets, which shows that the speed of development is very fast. The Satellite Pig Farm in Changjiang Commune in Ziyang currently has 1,400 pigs, and is preparing to develop to 4,000 pigs by the end of this year. In order to run the commune diligently and thriftily, so that there are many pigs and labor is saved, this commune has realized tap water, straw bundling machine, rail transportation, and blower stove. Using a large amount of stone and a small amount of bricks, a vaulted pigsty is built, which is ventilated and transparent, and there is no accumulated water or manure in the sty. It is exceptionally clean and looks like a foreign house. The masses call it the "Pig Mansion." The characteristics of pig raising development in all counties are: large scale, rapid development, good raising, semi-mechanization, and a fiery atmosphere. All counties are implementing the simultaneous development of grain and cash crops, and the simultaneous development of grain and diversified operations with one heart and one mind in agricultural production. From the above examples, it can be seen that the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations" is correct and conforms to the wishes of the broad masses of farmers. That is to say, the socialist relations of production and the development of productive forces are coordinated and mutually promoted. Therefore, farmers can automatically and enthusiastically implement this policy under the specific leadership of the Party, and can do everything possible to realize the policy more, faster, better, and more economically, in line with the requirements of the General Line.

In the experience of successive years of the Great Leap Forward, all counties have summed up such a point, that is: "Grasp early planting, grasp multiple planting, grasp high yield." The farmers all said: "One early is a hundred earlies, one initiative is a hundred initiatives." This year, the general seedling raising and sowing have been brought forward by one or two solar terms compared to last year. Jianyang advanced cotton seedling raising to sowing before the Rain Water solar term, and transplanted before the Spring Equinox. The experimental fields were transplanted as early as the Awakening of Insects solar term. Ziyang planted peanuts thirty or forty days earlier than last year. The farmers said that this makes the peanut growth nodes dense and produces more results. Grasping early planting can not only greatly increase production, but also seize one or two more crops. In terms of grasping multiple planting: Ziyang vigorously promoted "covering the mountains with green" this year and increased the planting area by as much as 160,000 mu. Other counties are also vigorously promoting "covering the mountains with green." What we saw along the way was that the edges of fields, the corners of land, the sides of roads, the sides of rivers, the sides of mountains, were all planted with crops. In particular, all counties are focusing on large-scale high yields this year, promoting last year's high-yield experience, and vigorously developing "high-yield kings" and "high-yield king groups." Lezhi launched a high-yield movement of 60,000 mu of wheat with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu, 50,000 mu of cotton with a yield of 200 jin per mu, 10,000 mu of rapeseed with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. Ziyang wants to strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on 110,000 mu of peanuts, and strive for a yield of 2,000 jin per mu on 34,000 mu of peanut command fields. It is also necessary to further develop the peanut king from the experience of bearing 1,766 seeds on one plant last year. These all show that they are striving for a higher-speed sustained leap forward on the basis of the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years.

All counties are equally focused on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Along the lines of the experience accumulated over the past few years, each word of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" has been developed in each county with its own characteristics, practices, and technical specifications, and is implemented in accordance with local conditions and at the appropriate time. Lezhi is a hilly area, and the soil is not very good, but this year the wheat is growing better than last year, with strong stalks and uniform specifications, and the seedlings are neatly arranged, becoming a red flag in Sichuan as it was last year. Its key is: "Fertilizer takes command," "Eliminate the three types of seedlings before sowing," select seeds, deep plowing, rational close planting, strictly abide by technical specifications, strengthen fine management, apply fertilizer and cultivate the soil at the same time, and control insects. Vigorously carry out "thousands of pits and tens of thousands of pools," combining water storage, fertilizer accumulation, and soil conservation. Due to good water conservancy work, it was not affected under the special natural disaster last year, and grain production still increased by 50%. This year, the implementation of fertilizer taking command, we saw piles of fertilizer everywhere along the field and road, piled up like mountains, neatly arranged like walls, with the big characters "Fertilizer General," "Fertilizer King," "Fertilizer Commander," "Fertilizer Mountain" written on them. Farmers in groups are transporting fertilizer, applying base fertilizer, and preparing for spring production. Lezhi also has a "Ten-Slope" high-yield area. The soil on the slope is mostly transported from the bottom of the mountain to be leveled, and the wheat seedlings grow as strong as those in the plains. Suining used to be a hilly area where "mountain floods occur when it rains, and drought occurs when it does not rain," but in recent years, due to good water conservancy construction and good water and soil conservation, full planting was still guaranteed last year under the threat of special natural disasters. The farmers told us that even if it does not rain for ten months in the future, there will be no problem. At present, Suining, like Lezhi, is also focusing on the late-stage management of minor spring crops, while stepping up preparations for spring production. These, on the one hand, illustrate the correctness of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and the Party's policies, and on the other hand, illustrate that the people of all counties, under the leadership of the Party, are implementing the Party's policies with soaring enthusiasm, one heart, one mind, and one appearance, and only by implementing the Party's policies can they continuously achieve victories on the production front.

In vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, the masses of farmers in all counties, under the shining light of the General Line, consciously carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and have created many miracles. Here are just a few examples. Last year, the masses of farmers in Jianyang created the method of raising seedlings in fire-heated beds, which has been widely promoted this year. Now it has gone a step further. Some communes have established large-scale glass greenhouses, and some have cleverly used the warm air from the factory chimneys near the factories, saving a lot of fuel and labor required by the greenhouses. We saw that the Agricultural Technology Institute of Jiajia People's Commune is cultivating perennial cotton kings in glass greenhouses. In less than a year, each plant has averaged 1,175 cotton bolls, and one plant has already produced 1,624 bolls, and is still continuously growing branches, flowering, and bearing bolls, continuing to thrive. Comrade Zhang Sizhou, the head of Mianfeng Commune, was an illiterate poor peasant before liberation, and is now a representative of the people of the whole country. He adopted the method of hybridization to cultivate cotton kings, creating cotton bolls that can grow into seven or eight petals to twelve petals, and also created a "braid flower" in which a series of fifteen or six peaches grow together like braids. Wuhuang Horticultural Farm in Ziyang created a method of grafting young trees with old trees, which can bring old fruit trees back to life. There are many facts of inventions and creations by the working people that we have seen, and it is impossible to list them all. It is really as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said, "New people and new things emerge one after another, and innovations bloom everywhere." This precisely shows that the thinking of the working people is advanced, the ability is great, and the wisdom is infinite. In production practice, they can skillfully use science, master science, and thus can continuously create inventions, and develop science, just as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "Ordinary laborers with production practice experience can also or even better reform old technologies and create new technologies."

At present, technical innovation and technical revolution have become an important key to realizing the sustained Great Leap Forward in 1960, and "vigorously carrying out semi-mechanization and accelerating the realization of mechanization" have become the unanimous and urgent requirements of the broad masses of people in various places in production. Lezhi County had already established a machinery factory from scratch. Through the mass "Three-Five Movement," it armed the farm tool factories and farm tool repair stations in various districts, communes, and teams in the county. This year, it has developed into two agricultural machinery factories in the county; five of the six district farm tool factories have preliminary machinery, and fifty-one of the sixty-five township and commune farm tool factories have partial machinery. They have now produced a large number of 49 kinds of improved and new farm tools, totaling more than 153,000 pieces, which can save more than 23 million workdays. They are now producing various machines and tools to support agricultural technical transformation in large quantities. The masses praised and said: "New farm tools are really good, they improve work efficiency and reduce effort; everyone uses new tools, why worry about not doing a good job in production?" "Cartization is really good, it is convenient and easy to use, one person can抵抵 ten people, it is highly efficient in transporting fertilizer and grain, the thousand-year-old carrying pole is gone, thanks to the good leadership of the Party." Under the leadership of the Party, the direction of striving to vigorously carry out semi-mechanization and accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization is "taking indigenous methods as the main focus, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and transitioning from indigenous to foreign methods." The broad masses of people have been encouraged and supported by the Party, and are carrying out indigenous mechanization or combining indigenous and foreign methods of mechanization everywhere. Lezhi is vigorously carrying out semi-mechanization in silkworm raising, public canteens, and pig farms. What we saw in other counties was also the widespread implementation of semi-mechanization and mechanization. What we deeply feel is that: in Sichuan Province, at the same time as the current production struggle climax of the whole Party and the whole people with one heart, one mind, and one appearance to realize the sustained Great Leap Forward this year, a revolutionary climax of the whole people to vigorously carry out semi-mechanization and accelerate the realization of mechanization has begun to emerge. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report on this year's National Economic Plan at the National People's Congress on March 30: "The great march of the Chinese people to conquer backward technology has already begun throughout the country. Of course, this is only the beginning of things, but it is an extremely gratifying beginning." He also accurately pointed out: This "technical innovation and technical revolution movement with broad mass participation is the inevitable result of continuously carrying out economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, and cultural revolution, and is the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune." Finally, he also dialectically pointed out the great significance of this revolution, saying: "The Great Leap Forward in production cannot but cause a profound technical revolution, and the technical revolution will inevitably lead production to a new and higher level." Vice Premier Li called on the people of the whole country to "carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement more widely and more deeply, so that it can be continuously consolidated, developed, and improved, and so that it can advance along the correct, scientific, and mass path." Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report called for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, and for "broadly mobilizing the strength of all aspects"; "It is necessary to be guided by the spirit of continuous revolution, and under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, to go all out and strive hard." We deeply believe that these calls are correct and timely. This time, we saw from Sichuan a new situation of the whole Party and the whole people striving with one heart, one mind, and one appearance to realize the Great Leap Forward in 1960. Now, having heard the representatives and members of various provinces in the conference reflect the high tide of local production and construction, we also realize that the whole country is striving enthusiastically with one heart, one mind, and one appearance to realize the Great Leap Forward in 1960. The reports and calls of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin will greatly inspire people and set off a more massive and magnificent high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Therefore, we firmly believe that the National Economic Plan for 1960 will be successfully completed and overfulfilled, and we will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years; and we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the original requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program in less than twelve years. This is the victory of the correct leadership of the Party, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The three red flags unite the people of the whole country, mobilize all positive factors, and form a huge torrent and unparalleled force of socialist construction with the whole Party and the whole people of one heart, one mind, and one appearance. We believe what Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, "The speed of the Great Leap Forward can definitely be sustained for a long time." The situation of the Great Leap Forward will be like the Yangtze River, rolling and surging, with one wave higher than the other, taking the 650 million people to the ocean of happiness and pushing our country to a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Looking forward to the future, we are infinitely excited and encouraged! Let us shout:

Long live the General Line!
Long live the Great Leap Forward!
Long live the People's Commune!
Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups!

### 一条心、一股劲、一个样大跃进的新形势  郎毓秀代表和刘芦隐、伍培英、陆秀委员谈在四川视察的感受

专栏：

    一条心、一股劲、一个样大跃进的新形势
    郎毓秀代表和刘芦隐、伍培英、陆秀委员谈在四川视察的感受主席，各位委员，各位代表：
    我们完全同意陈叔通副主席的政协全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、和李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理的“再提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告。
    当前我们国内经济的政治的大好形势是有利于实现更好更全面的持续跃进的形势。四川和全国一样好，今年全省开展的农业生产运动出现了一条心，一股劲，一个样的全面持续跃进的新局面。这一个新局面的形成，是由于党的正确领导，总路线的光辉照耀，连年大跃进的胜利基础，以及人民公社的无比优越性的结果。而另一方面又是和广大农民的政治思想觉悟大大提高，生产收入大大增加，生活越过越好，干劲越来越大分不开的。在这一系列的大好情势之下，中共四川省委在今年2月间及时地发出了“全党全民一条心、一股劲、一个样全面持续跃进”的号召。这一个号召，对当前四川省广大农民在生产战线上开展着的持续大跃进运动的高潮，具有决定性的意义。
    我们这次在四川视察了简阳，资阳，乐至、遂宁，中江等县，除一般视察外又进行了重点视察，我们感受最深的是：广大农民在党的领导下，已经汇成了全党全民一条心、一股劲、一个样的全面持续大跃进的洪流。同时，这股洪流又层层贯注到每一社，每一队，每一户，每一人，每一种工作，做到了事事落实，人人落实，一竿到底。他们在生产规划上，树立了雄心大志；坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针；积极贯彻“八字宪法”；大搞技术革新和技术革命，大大提高劳动生产率。在我们这次视察期间，他们正在加强小春的田间管理，并在作好春耕春种的准备。据我们所见，今年小春长得非常茂盛，苗稼整齐一律，已可肯定大丰收。我们所到之处，看见一片蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，一股轰轰烈烈的热潮，形成了万马奔腾，一日千里的新的大跃进的声势。
    他们在生产规划上，立了雄心大志，订了积极而又可靠的指标。简阳正在搞大面积的棉花增产，乐至要实现“小春半年粮”；中江提出一年走完十年路”的雄迈口号。在单位面积产量上，乐至是个丘陵地区，自然条件不是很好的，他们今年要“实现千百万伟大指标”，即：实现亩产小麦一千斤，棉花一百斤，蚕茧每张一百斤，红苕亩产一万斤。各县都提出要“学乐至，赶乐至”的口号。资阳要实现大面积亩产花生一千斤，指挥田争取亩产达到二千斤。简阳要实现大面积亩产皮棉一百六十斤，指挥田亩产一千斤。这些都表明，他们都一条心地树立了高产思想。
    在遵照国民经济按比例发展的方针下，各县都坚持“以农业为基础，工业为主导，优先发展重工业与迅速发展农业相结合”的原则，贯彻了“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的方针。各县除了大大地发展粮食作物外，都结合着自己的具体条件和特点，大力发展多种经营。简阳县“既保证重点（粮食）又保证特点（棉花）”的发展，还搞其他的多种经营；资阳县于粮食之外，大种花生，柑桔，泽泻（中药），并发展家禽，现在平均每人有家禽十只，个别的如鲁家公社已达到每人三十只；乐至县植桑四千万株，在去年养蚕五千七百张的基础上今年养蚕发展到二万张，新建立了自动化的缫丝厂，正在准备大大发展蚕丝。现在，各县在发展多种经营的同时，还大大发展养猪事业，掀起了群众性的养猪高潮。简阳今年就准备发展生猪一百二十万头，现在所养的最重的肥猪已达到九百六十五斤。为了要把生猪大量发展起来，各县都注重发展母猪。中江杰兴公社有个养猪场，一天就产九窝，共有一百二十三头小猪，可见发展的速度很快。资阳长江公社的卫星养猪场现有一千四百头猪，准备到今年年底发展到四千头。为了勤俭办社，做到养猪多，劳力省，这个社就实现了自来水化，扎草机化，轨道化和鼓风灶化。用大量的石料和少量的砖建成卷洞式的猪圈，通风透光，圈无积水积粪，清洁异常，看来像洋房，群众叫它为“猪公馆”。各县发展养猪的特点是：规模大，发展快，养得好，搞半机械化，搞得来一团火热。各县在农业生产上都是一条心一股劲地实行粮食与经济作物同时并举，粮食与多种经营同时并举。从上述这些例子中，可以看出，“以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营”的方针是正确的，是和广大农民的愿望符合的。这就是说，社会主义的生产关系与生产力的发展是互相协调，互相推进的。因此，农民就很自动地热情地能够在党的具体领导下贯彻这一方针，也就能够千方百计地把方针实现得又多又快，又好又省，符合总路线的要求。
    各县在连年跃进的经验中，总结出这么一条，就是：“抓早种，抓多种，抓高产”。农民们都说：“一早百早，一主动百主动”。今年一般的育苗播种都比去年又提早一两个节令。简阳今年把棉花育苗提早到雨水前下种，春分前栽完，试验田提早到惊蛰就栽苗。资阳的花生比去年提早三四十天播种，农民说，这样就使花生成长起来的节子密，结果多。抓早种不仅可以大大增产，还可以多抓一两季作物。在抓多种方面：资阳今年大搞满山青并增种面积达十六万亩之多，其他各县都在大搞“满山青”。我们沿途所见，田边，地角，路边，河边，山边，到处种满了作物。特别是各县今年都在大抓大面积高产，推广去年的高产经验，大搞“高产王”，“高产王群”。乐至展开了六万亩小麦亩产二千斤，五万亩棉花亩产二百斤，一万亩油菜亩产一千斤，十万亩红苕亩产一万斤的高产运动。资阳十一万亩花生要争取亩产一千斤，三万四千亩花生指挥田要争取亩产达到二千斤。还要把花生王从去年一株结一千七百六十六颗的经验基础上更求发展。这些都说明，它们都争取在两年来大跃进的经验基础上，更求高速度的持续跃进。
    各县对“八字宪法”都一样地抓得紧。沿着几年来积累的经验，“八字宪法”的每一个字在各县都已经发展到各有特点，各有作法，各有技术规格，因地因时地贯彻它。乐至是丘陵地区，土壤也并不好，但是今年小麦长得比去年更好，秆梗茁壮，规格一律，苗稼整齐，与去年一样成为四川一面红旗。它的要诀是：“肥料挂帅”，“把三类苗消灭在播种之前”，选种、深耕，合理密植，严守技术规格，加强精细管理，追一次肥跟着就培一次土，并治一次虫。大搞“千坑万凼”，把蓄水，积肥，保土三者结合起来。由于水利工作好，去年特大自然灾害之下，未受影响，粮食仍然增产50％。今年实行肥料挂帅，我们沿途看见田边路边处处堆肥，堆积如山，整齐如壁，上面大书“肥将”“肥王”“肥帅”“肥山”大字，农民成群结队正在搬运肥料，分施底肥，准备大春生产。乐至还有“十坡”丰产片，坡上的土大都是从山下运上去铺平起来的，麦苗长得与平坝一样的茁壮。遂宁过去是一个“下雨就是山洪，不下雨就是干旱”的丘陵地区，但最近几年由于水利兴修好，水土保持好，去年在特大自然灾害的威胁下，仍然保证了满栽满插。农民们对我们说，今后那怕十个月不下雨也不会有问题。目前遂宁也同乐至一样地正在抓紧小春的后期管理，同时加紧准备大春的生产。这些，一方面说明“八字宪法”和党的方针政策的正确性，一方面说明各县人民在党领导之下，是以冲天干劲，一条心、一股劲、一个样地贯彻党的方针政策，也只有贯彻党的方针政策，才能在生产战线上不断取得胜利。
    在大搞技术革新和技术革命上，各县农民群众在总路线光辉照耀下，自觉地发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，创造了许多奇迹。这里只举几个事例。简阳农民群众去年创造火温床育苗的方法，今年普遍推广，现在更进了一步，有的社建立大规模的玻璃温室，有的在工厂附近巧妙地利用工厂烟囱里的暖气，节约了温室需要的大量燃料和劳动力。我们看到，贾家人民公社农技所，用玻璃温室培养着宿根棉花王，不到一年，每株平均结了棉桃一千一百七十五个，有一株已结桃一千六百二十四个，还在陆续生枝开花结桃，一直欣欣向荣。棉丰社社长张泗州同志，解放前是文盲的贫雇农，现在是全国人民的代表，他采取杂交方法培养棉花王，创造了棉桃能长成七八瓣到十二瓣，还创造了一连串十五、六个桃子长在一起形同辫子的“辫子花。”资阳伍隍园艺场创造了用幼树与老树接株的办法，能使老果树起死回生。我们所见的劳动人民创造发明的事实还多，不遑枚举。真是如李富春副总理说的“新人新事层出不穷，革新创举到处开花”。这正表明，劳动人民群众的思想是先进的，能力是伟大的，智慧是无穷的，在生产实践中就能够熟练科学，掌握科学，因而就不断地能够创造发明，发展科学，诚如李富春副总理所说的：“有生产实践经验的普通劳动者也可以甚至更可以改革旧技术和创造新技术。”
    目前，技术革新和技术革命已经成为实现1960年持续大跃进的一个重要关键，“大搞半机械化，加速实现机械化”，已经成为各地广大人民群众在生产上一致迫切的要求。乐至县早已从无到有建立了一个机械厂，通过群众性的“三五运动”，把全县各区各公社各队的农具厂、农具修配站武装起来，到今年就发展成为县有的两个农业机械厂；六个区的农具厂有五个已经有初步的机械，六十五个乡、社农具厂有五十一个已经有部分的机械。它们现在已大批造出各种改良和新式农具四十九种，计十五万三千多件，可节约二千三百多万个劳动日。它们现在正在大批制造支援农业技术改造的各种机械和工具。群众歌颂说：“新式农具真正好，工效提高费力少；人人都用新工具，何愁生产搞不好？”“车子化，真正好，使用方便又轻巧，一人能抵十人挑，运肥运粮工效高，千年扁担丢掉了，感谢党的好领导”。在党的领导下，大搞半机械化加速实现农业机械化的努力方向是“以土为主，土洋结合，由土到洋”。广大人民群众得到党的鼓励和支持，到处都在搞土机械化或土洋结合的机械化。乐至在养蚕，公共食堂，养猪场等方面大搞半机械化。其他各县，我们所看到的也都在普遍地搞半机械化和机械化。我们所深切感到的是：在四川省当前全党全民一条心、一股劲、一个样地实现今年持续大跃进的生产斗争高潮的同时，已经开始产生一个大搞半机械化，加速实现机械化的全民性的革命高潮。正如李富春副总理在3月30日在这次全国人民代表大会所作的关于今年国民经济计划的报告时所指出：“我国人民征服落后技术的伟大进军，已经在全国范围内开始发动起来了。当然，这只是事情的开端，但是，这是一个极为可喜的开端”。他又精确地指出：这个“具有广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命的必然结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物”。最后，他还辩证地指出这一革命的伟大意义，说：“生产的大跃进，不能不引起深刻的技术革命，而技术革命又必将把生产引向一个新的更高的水平”。李副总理号召全国人民“把技术革新和技术革命运动更广泛地、更深入地开展起来，使它不断地巩固，发展和提高，使它沿着正确的科学的全民的道路前进。”谭震林副总理的报告号召提前实现农业发展纲要，要“广泛动员一切方面的力量”；“必须本着不断革命的精神，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三面红旗的引导下鼓足干劲，努力奋斗。”我们深切地认为这些号召是正确的，及时的。我们这次视察，从四川看到了全党全民一条心、一股劲、一个样为实现1960年大跃进而奋斗的新形势，现在从大会中听了各省代表委员们反映各地生产建设的高潮，我们也体会到全国都是一条心、一股劲、一个样地为实现1960年的大跃进而热烈地奋斗着。李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告和号召，将大大地鼓舞人心，掀起声势更为浩大，波澜更为壮阔的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动高潮。因此，我们深信：1960年的国民经济计划一定会胜利地完成，并可超额完成，我们一定能够在比十年更少的时间内在主要工业品产量方面赶上英国；也一定能够在比十二年更短的时间内完成和超额完成农业发展纲要的原定要求。这是党的正确领导的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的胜利。三面红旗把全国人民团结起来，把一切积极因素调动起来，形成全党全民一条心、一股劲、一个样的社会主义建设的巨大洪流和无比力量。我们相信李先念副总理所说的，“跃进的速度肯定能够长期持续”，大跃进的形势，将像长江大河滚滚滔滔，一浪高一浪，把六亿五千万人民带到幸福的海洋，把我们的国家推进到具有现代工业现代农业和现代科学文化的强大社会主义国家。瞻望前途，我们无限兴奋和鼓舞！让我们高呼：
    总路线万岁！
    大跃进万岁！
    人民公社万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的各族人民领袖毛主席万岁！
