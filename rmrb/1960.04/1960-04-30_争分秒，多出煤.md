Seize Every Second, Produce More Coal
Zhang Guowei, Mechanic and Electrician of Jiawang Coal Mine, Jiangsu

    In our working face, everything from coal extraction to transportation is mechanized. Whenever the combine, electric conveyor, and electric coal drill display their power, replacing heavy manual labor and extracting the shining "black gold," my heart is filled with pride and happiness: We are the masters of machines!
    In the working face, the various work types are like the links of a conveyor chain, one linked to another. The mechanic and electrician are like the small axle connecting the links. Therefore, the quality of a mechanic and electrician's work is not just his own business; it is directly related to the overall task.
    "Prevention is better than cure." To be a good master of the machines, one must always be proactive and seize every second to eliminate accidents before they happen.
    Once, before starting work, I routinely made a detailed inspection of all the machines. When inspecting the last one, I discovered a loose power line terminal on the switch. Experience told me that this was the root of an accident! It was like a time bomb, ready to cause big trouble at any moment. Without delay, I decided to quickly repair it! I instructed my assistant to cut off the power and made preparations. At that moment, the team leader arrived and grabbed my hand, anxiously asking, "How many minutes will it take to fix it?"
    "Seven minutes!" I replied.
    "Oh, there are only five minutes left!" He said anxiously, looking at his watch. "The task will be affected!"
    I understood the team leader's feelings. Miners understand the seriousness of the task most deeply. Failure to complete the task will affect everyone from the entire mine to the nation!
    Suddenly, images flashed through my mind: the steelmaking furnace, the running train, the sailing ship... all seemed to be reaching out and shouting: "We need coal, we need coal!"
    I started working quickly, and a second-by-second battle began! The team leader rushed forward to help me. I removed the switch cover, endured the choking and unpleasant smell, stretched my head over, bent down, and touched the hard and prickly connecting copper strip. I quickly and calmly connected the wire terminal and tightened the screw... Power was restored! – We seized the time after all!
    "Start the machine!" the team leader ordered. The roar of the machine, cheerful laughter, heroic vows, and swinging lights... the working face was bustling! Look, the support worker waved his strong arms, the drilling worker showed his skillful technique; the driver made agile movements; the combine roared, opening its big mouth and greedily swallowing the coal wall, and then spitting the crushed coal into the electric conveyor; the transport conveyor carried the crowded, shiny coal, like a black river, flowing endlessly.... I breathed a sigh of relief, the joy in my heart, well, I really don't know how to express it!

    争分秒，多出煤
    江苏贾汪煤矿机电工　张国威
    我们的掌子面，从落煤到运输，都是机械化了。每当康拜因、电溜子、煤眼电钻施展出它们的威力，代替了笨重的体力劳动，采下闪光“乌金”的时候，我的心里充满着骄傲和幸福：我们是机器的主人了啊！
    掌子面里，各工种间挺像溜子的链条，一环扣一环。机电工就像那连接链条的小轴。所以，一个机电工工作的好坏，决不只是自己一个人的事情，是直接和整体任务相关连的。
    “预防胜于治疗”，要当好机器的主人，必须处处争得主动，争分夺秒地把事故消灭在发生之前。
    那一次，上班前，我照例对各部机器作了详细检查。检查到最后一部时，发现开关的一根电源线头松动了。经验告诉我，这是事故的祸根！它像定时炸弹一样，说不定什么时候就会出大乱子。事不宜迟，决定迅速抢修！我一面嘱咐助手跑去停电，一面作准备。这时班长赶到了，一把抓住我的手，急促地问：“几分钟能修好？”
    “七分钟！”我回答。
    “呀，只剩下五分钟了！”他看着表焦急地说：“任务，要受影响了！”
    我了解班长的心情。矿工最懂得任务的严肃性。完不成任务，小至全矿，大至国家，都要受影响的啊！
    这忽儿，一个一个镜头闪过我的脑际：炼钢的高炉、火车的奔驰、轮船的行驶……都仿佛在伸手叫喊：“要煤，要煤！”
    我火速地动起手来，一场分秒必争的战斗开始了！班长抢到前面给我帮忙。我卸下开关盖，忍着一股扑面呛人的难闻气味，伸过头，弯过身子，触到了又硬又刺手的接线铜条。我飞快而沉着地接好了线头，拧紧了螺丝……送电了！——到底争得了时间！
    “开车！”班长下了命令。机器的轰鸣、爽朗的笑声、豪壮的誓言、晃动的灯光……掌子面沸腾了！看哪，支柱工挥着粗壮的手臂，打眼工熟练的技巧；司机灵敏的动作；康拜因吼叫着，张着大嘴，贪婪地吞着煤壁，然后再把嚼碎的煤块儿吐进电溜子里；运输溜子驮着那拥拥挤挤闪着亮光的煤块儿，像一条黑色的小河，永不停息地流去……。我松了一口长气，心里的高兴劲儿，咳，真不知怎么说出！
