Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 13th to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, expressing warm support for "Africa Day" to be held by the conference on the 15th.

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' telegram said: "In recent years, the flames of opposition to colonialism and the struggle for national independence have spread throughout the African continent. A series of countries have declared independence. The Algerian people are persevering in their anti-imperialist armed struggle. The people of East Africa, Central Africa, and West Africa have risen up to fight for independence. Recently, Africans in the Union of South Africa launched a heroic large-scale struggle against racial discrimination.

    "These have severely hit the imperialist colonial system. It proves once again that imperialism is, after all, a paper tiger, and any conspiracy to maintain colonialism and rule the African people will inevitably meet with complete failure.

    "The Chinese workers and people have always sympathized with and resolutely supported the African people's struggle for national independence and in defending it. We wish the African people continued new victories in this struggle."

    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram today to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, on the occasion of the conference holding "Africa Day," to congratulate, in the name of Chinese women, our African brothers and sisters on achieving even greater victories in the heroic struggle for national independence and freedom.

    The All-China Women's Federation's telegram said: "The broad masses of African people and women have rapidly awakened, and the flames of independence and freedom are burning everywhere on the African continent. The end of imperialism is coming. We sincerely wish our African brothers and sisters to continue their efforts, strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, and move from victory to new and greater victories!"

    我全总、妇联致电支持“非洲日”
    祝非洲人民从胜利走向胜利
    新华社14日讯　中华全国总工会13日打电报给第二届亚非人民团结大会，对大会将在15日举行的“非洲日”表示热烈支持。
    全总的电报说：“近年来，非洲大陆到处燃起了反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的烽火。一系列国家宣布了独立。阿尔及利亚人民坚持着反帝武装斗争。东非、中非和西非人民纷纷起来争取独立。最近南非联邦的非洲人展开了英勇的反对种族歧视的大规模斗争。
    这些都沉重地打击了帝国主义的殖民体系。再一次证明了，帝国主义毕竟是纸老虎，任何维持殖民主义、统治非洲人民的阴谋必将遭到彻底的失败。
    “中国工人和人民一贯同情和坚决支持非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。祝非洲人民在这一斗争中不断取得新的胜利。”
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报给第二届亚非人民团结大会，在大会举行“非洲日”之际，以中国妇女的名义祝贺非洲的兄弟姊妹们在争取民族独立和自由的英勇斗争中，取得更大的胜利。
    全国妇联的电报说：“广大的非洲人民和妇女已经迅速觉醒起来了，非洲大陆到处燃烧起独立自由的烽火，帝国主义的末日将要到来。谨祝非洲的兄弟姊妹们再接再厉，加强团结，坚持斗争，从胜利走向新的、更大的胜利！”
