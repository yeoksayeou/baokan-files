Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: A technological innovation and revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is vigorously unfolding on the national aquatic products front. From the ocean to fresh water, from fishing to aquaculture, from production to processing and transportation, fishermen and workers are all taking action, offering suggestions, and revolutionizing manual operations.

In fishing production, the focus is on motorization, with major reforms in fishing gear and operating methods. In recent months, fishing communes in coastal areas have been building motorized sailing boats on a large scale, and freshwater fishing has also begun to experiment with motorized sailing boats. In Zhoushan, Zhejiang, 50% of fishermen are already using motorized sailing boats, and small boats in coastal production are also using motorized tugs; the technological innovation and revolution of the Ant Island Commune are the most prominent, and now the entire commune has achieved mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in five main areas: deep-sea fishing, coastal seine fishing, boat repair, net maintenance, and fish processing. The entire commune can save 70,000 labor days per year compared to before. In addition, many fishing communes along the coast of China also use machines as power in ocean fishing, replacing manpower for net lifting, unloading fish, raising sails, and raising anchors.

In freshwater aquaculture, the artificial incubation of silver carp and bighead carp has been further developed, and various excellent varieties such as Vietnamese fish, Soviet scaled carp, and Korean rainbow trout are being further propagated and promoted. Various production tools are moving towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. The Lanxi Aquaculture Farm in Yiyang, Hunan, has created ten major tools, including a cake-chopping and grinding machine for preparing fish feed, which can chop and grind 6,400 catties of cake per day, increasing efficiency sixty times compared to manual and animal power grinding; an automatic fish fry loading device that allows fish fry to be caught without entering the water; and an automatic fish fry sorting and cleaning device that greatly reduces labor intensity and improves the survival rate of fish fry. The use of sealed oxygen-filled nylon bags for fish fry transportation is a key and significant change, which is of great significance for the development of fisheries in new areas and remote areas, and greatly saves labor and transportation tools.

In marine aquaculture, the seedling separation work of kelp, which requires the most labor and has the highest labor intensity, also has machines to replace manual labor. Now, various places have created seedling clamping machines, simple seedling clamping devices, seedling aligning boards, as well as water gun seedling washing devices, rapid water layer adjustment methods, live water seedling collection, live wheel vehicles and boats, aerial seedling transportation, and water transportation, liberating people once again from the heavy physical labor on the swaying sea surface. Artificial egg collection, seedling collection and aquaculture of prawns, mullet, grey mullet, mussels, Gracilaria, and laver have had a good start.

In terms of processing, various places have successively created fish scaling machines, fish splitting machines, cuttlefish washing machines, shrimp shelling machines, etc., which have fundamentally changed the backward situation of "one person, one knife, processing a handful of salt, smelly fish and shrimp in peak season" that has been left over for thousands of years. Not only is the work efficiency fast, but the quality of fish products is also greatly improved. Aquatic science work has also made great progress. Some basic work has been completed, such as the preliminary completion of resource surveys of various sea areas in eastern China and the general survey of marine fishing gear in the country, and fish situation forecasting has begun; the traditional fish farming experience of China for thousands of years has also been summarized, and "Freshwater Aquaculture" and "Port Aquaculture Summary" have been written. Even some old fishermen and fishermen who have never attended school have begun to write books. Yan Weibin, a net weaving engineer of the Xiazhi Commune in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, has written the first technical creation of fishermen, "Net Weaving," and is writing a new book on weaving forty kinds of fishing nets.

    渔船机帆化　养鱼用机械　运鱼苗用尼龙袋
    水产部门技术面貌急剧变化
    据新华社15日讯　以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国水产战线上蓬勃展开。从海洋到淡水，从捕捞到养殖，从生产到加工、运输，各个方面的渔民和职工，人人动手，个个献计，大革手工操作之命。
    捕捞生产上以机帆化为中心，大搞网具和操作方法的改革。近几个月来，沿海各地渔业公社大造机帆船，淡水捕鱼也开始采用机帆船试捕。浙江舟山50％的渔民已上了机帆船，近海生产的小船也采用了机帆拖驳；蚂蚁岛公社的技术革新和技术革命搞得最为突出，现在全社远洋捕捞、近洋张网、船具修造、网具维护、鱼货加工等五个主要方面，已经全部实现了机械化半机械化、自动化和半自动化。全社一年可比以前节省七万个劳动日。另外，全国沿海各地很多渔业公社，在海洋捕捞中，还用机器作动力，代替人力进行起网、卸鱼、起帆、起锚等工作。
    在淡水养殖上，鲢、鳙鱼的人工孵化已有了进一步的发展，各种优良品种如越南鱼、苏联鳞鲤、朝鲜虹鳟等正在进一步繁殖推广。各种生产工具正在向机械化、半机械化跃进。湖南益阳兰溪养殖场创造了十大工具，其中给鱼准备饲料的砍饼磨粉机，一天能砍饼磨粉六千四百斤，比人工和畜力碾磨提高工效六十倍；鱼苗自动上箱器，使捞鱼苗可以不下水；鱼苗自动分类清野器，大大减轻了劳动强度，并提高了鱼苗成活率。鱼苗运输中改用密封充氧尼龙袋，是一项带关键性的重大变革，对发展新区和边远地区的渔业有重大意义，并大大地节约了运送的劳动力和交通运输工具。
    海水养殖中，需要劳动力最多、劳动强度最大的海带分苗工作，也有了机具来代替手工劳动。现在各地已经创制了夹苗机、简易夹苗器、理苗板，还创制了水枪洗苗器、快速调整水层法、活水采苗、活轮车船、空中运苗、水上运苗等，使人们从摇摇晃晃的海面上的笨重体力劳动中获得了又一次的解放。对虾、鲻鱼、鮻鱼、贻贝、江离、紫菜等的人工采卵采苗养殖已有良好的开端。
    加工方面，各地先后创制了去鱼鳞机、剖鱼机、洗墨鱼机、虾米脱壳机等，使千百年来遗留下来的“一人一把刀、加工一把盐、旺季臭鱼虾”的落后面貌起了根本的变化，不仅工效快，鱼货质量也大为提高。水产科学工作也有了巨大的进展。一些基础工作已经完成，如我国东面各海区的资源调查和全国海洋渔具普查已初步完成，并开始了鱼情预报工作；还总结了我国几千年来的传统养鱼经验，写成了淡水养殖学和港养总结，甚至一些从没念过书的老渔工、渔民，也开始写书。浙江舟山虾峙公社织网工程师严位本，已写成了渔民第一部技术创作“织网”，并正在写作一部织四十种渔网的新著。
