On the Chinese side, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu participated in the talks. On the Burmese side, Foreign Minister Sao Khun Hkio also participated.

The Premiers of the two countries noted with satisfaction that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have entered a new stage due to the signing of the "Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma" and the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma on the Question of the Boundary between the Two Countries." Both sides are determined to continue to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two countries, as well as the spirit and provisions of the above-mentioned treaty and agreement, to take measures to further strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, develop trade, promote cultural and friendly ties, and to comprehensively and finally resolve the boundary issue between the two countries as soon as possible.

Premier Zhou's visit to Rangoon coincided with the fifth anniversary of the historically significant Bandung Conference. The two Premiers were pleased to confirm that the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations over the past five years and the series of victories achieved by the people of Asian and African countries under the banner of independence, peace, and friendship have fully demonstrated the great vitality of the Bandung Spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Both sides hope that Asian and African countries will adhere to the Bandung Spirit and devote themselves to strengthening the unity of the Asian and African people in the struggle for national independence and against racial discrimination. Both sides condemn the repressive measures and use of force taken by certain governments against the African people.

The two Premiers are convinced that maintaining peace is an important issue of common concern to the people of all countries in the world. Both sides hope that the summit conference of great powers to be held in May this year will contribute to world peace and the relaxation of international tensions, and believe that the countries concerned should promptly reach agreements on issues such as the prohibition of nuclear weapons and comprehensive disarmament.

On behalf of the Chinese government, Premier Zhou Enlai invited Prime Minister U Nu to visit China for a friendly visit. Prime Minister U Nu gladly accepted the invitation and expressed that he would realize this visit as soon as possible.
