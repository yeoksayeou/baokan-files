Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 4th: Nepalese newspapers have generally welcomed the agreements reached between China and Nepal.

    The "Gorkha Khabarpatrika" published an article on March 28 stating that the joint communiqué between the Chinese and Nepalese governments, the boundary agreement, the economic assistance agreement, and the friendly talks between the two prime ministers provide an example of how two countries with different social systems, political ideologies, and approaches can forge deep friendships and live in peace. It also proves that, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, countries can easily resolve all issues.

    The article said that it is very gratifying and encouraging that the two countries will further strengthen their friendship. The article pointed out, "Zhou Enlai's suggestion regarding the conclusion of a treaty of peace and friendship and Koirala's appreciation of this suggestion are of great significance."

    The article said, "The boundary agreement has added a glorious page to the history of relations between the two countries."

    The article said, "The economic assistance agreement stipulates that the two countries will strengthen economic cooperation on the basis of friendship and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, which confirms the two countries' belief in the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation."

    The article said that the welcome given by China to Prime Minister Koirala is also a welcome to the Nepalese people, which will have a lasting impact on the Nepalese people.

    The article said that the strengthening Sino-Nepalese friendship manifested in the joint communiqué will benefit world peace.

    The article further said that the proposed visit of Premier Zhou Enlai to Kathmandu will further strengthen the ties between the two countries, therefore, "We eagerly look forward to welcoming the outstanding leader of a great country and a great people."
    
    "Naya Samaj" said in editorials published on March 28 and 29 that the joint communiqué "sets an ideal example of the characteristics of the relationship that should exist between friendly neighboring countries."

    The newspaper pointed out that the new type of boundary agreement signed between Nepal and China shows that "if two friendly countries are willing, boundary issues can be easily resolved in a just and dignified manner."

    The newspaper said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal regarding the conclusion of a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries "stems from a noble desire to maintain lasting peace and strong friendship."

    The newspaper also said that China is becoming increasingly strong, and all Asian and African countries should grow as strong and progressive as China. However, some despicable propaganda creates unease about the growth of Chinese power. "In this regard, the significance of China's suggestion to sign a treaty of peace and friendship with Nepal is very significant."
    
    "Filingo" published an article on March 30 welcoming the economic assistance agreement. It said that this clearly shows "China hopes that its neighboring countries will also develop and progress." The newspaper said, "Nepal is very grateful for China's extremely friendly gesture."
    
    "Samaj" published comments on March 29 and 30 expressing regret for those who attempt to alienate and undermine Sino-Nepalese friendship. The newspaper said, "We believe that their attempts to obstruct this friendship, which is built on common beliefs and goodwill, will not succeed."

    The newspaper praised China's goodwill towards Nepal when discussing the boundary agreement signed between the two countries.
