Making a Big Fuss over "Two Dragons"
    A "Cargo Dragon": Production, Supply, Transportation, and Sales, Linked Together, Connected by One Line
    A "Passenger Dragon": Station, Train, Hotel, Ship, Step by Step, "One Ticket Home"

Chairman and Representatives of the Presidium for Railway Passenger and Freight Transport Technical Innovation:

    We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and we guarantee to earnestly implement them in our future work.

    Here, we would like to report to the conference on the situation of the Shenyang Railway Bureau and brother enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Fushun Mining, and Dalian Port, as well as local service industries, jointly making a big fuss over communist cooperation and organizing "two dragons" for passenger and freight transport.

    Our Shenyang Railway Bureau undertakes about one-eighth of the country's railway freight volume and one-fifth of the passenger volume. It is the gateway to the "Steel and Coal Capitals," the hub of land and sea transportation, and the key route for international through transport, forming a transport network that guarantees coal, steel, and transshipment at the port. The transportation task is very heavy. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the contradiction between insufficient transport capacity and transport volume has become more prominent. We have followed Chairman Mao's principle of continuous revolution and applied the policy of the whole Party and all people running transportation. Through the efforts of all employees, we have resolved this contradiction and overfulfilled the transport tasks assigned to us by the Party and the State, achieving two consecutive Great Leaps Forward in 1958 and 1959. In 1959, the freight volume increased nine times compared to 1949, and the passenger volume increased five times. Entering the first spring of the 1960s, we have achieved a "good start," "red every month," and a "completely red first quarter," breaking many conventions and creating countless miracles. Due to the rapid development of the national economy, transportation is still a weak link in the development of the national economy. However, we will do everything possible to improve and expand transport capacity to meet the demands of national economic development for transportation. The 100,000 employees and 200,000 family members of our bureau guarantee to the Party: We will resolutely complete as many tasks as the State assigns to us. We have learned from the Great Leap Forward that the heavier the task, the greater the enthusiasm; the greater the enthusiasm, the more methods; the greater the enthusiasm and more methods, the greater the confidence. Our main method is to carry out mass movements on a large scale, tap transportation potential, take transportation as the key, and vigorously promote the revolution of transportation equipment and the revolution of transportation organization. In carrying out mass movements on a large scale, "two dragons" appeared: one is the freight transport line – the "cargo dragon" – with production, supply, transportation, and sales linked together, ring by ring, connected by one line; the other is the passenger transport line – the "passenger dragon" – with station, train, hotel, and ship connected step by step, "one ticket home."

    Let us first talk about the "cargo dragon." Under the leadership of the Party, our bureau and brother enterprises have greatly strengthened communist cooperation in recent years and gained a lot of experience, raising the national red flag for road-factory transportation cooperation in Benxi City, the city of coal and iron. Last October, on the basis of vigorously developing "Red Flag Trains" and "Technical Performance Competitions," we also learned and promoted the "one-dragon" transportation experience of Qinhuangdao. According to our location and the tasks we undertake, we have jointly organized more than 100 large dragons spanning several provinces and connecting land and sea, and more than 1,000 small dragons extending to factories and mines and deeply into local areas, basically realizing a dragon network. This has formed a situation of large dragons leading small dragons, small dragons guaranteeing large dragons, dragons flying in groups, and cooperation everywhere. The broad masses of workers all discuss dragons and love dragons. Party organizations at all levels of the road, factory, mine, and port attach great importance to one-dragon transportation and have put this work on the important agenda of the Party committee. The secretary takes the lead, personally grasping the dragon; a "One-Dragon" Transportation Command was established; a dragon map was formulated; a "dragon platform" was specially set up; and "dragon protection" commando teams, "dragon birth" promotion teams, and "dragon welcoming" and "dragon sending" propaganda teams were organized; and dragon-dancing pacesetters were established. The road, factory, mine, and port launched large-scale, multi-service one-dragon joint technical performance competitions. Breaking through all road boundaries, factory boundaries, mine boundaries, and port boundaries, the internal production activities of the transportation industry were expanded to all departments related to transportation, and all transportation forces inside and outside the road were organized according to a unified transportation operation process, greatly tapping the transportation potential and realizing a double harvest of production and transportation.

    In the past, the development of Anshan Iron and Steel's transportation could not keep up with the development of production. Under the circumstances of a substantial increase in steel production, it caused transportation congestion, affecting the completion of production tasks. In response to this situation, Anshan Iron and Steel, while strengthening technical transformation, actively promoted the one-dragon transportation experience. On the basis of the "ten unifications" between road and factory, 46 main-line dragons were organized, and more than 600 small dragons within the factory with fixed time, fixed line, fixed quantity, and fixed variety were organized, with railway main-line dragons directly entering and leaving. The slogan "One dragon, guarantees production, two thousand vehicles, 8:00 PM" was put forward, and a mass movement of dragon-network transportation was launched with small dragons guaranteeing large dragons, large dragons leading small dragons, crisscrossing up and down, and combining inside and outside. This established a new transportation order, promoted a leap forward in production, and the continuous leap forward in production further improved transportation organization, enabling production and transportation to leap forward together. This February, the single operation time broke through the 20-hour target set by the Provincial Party Committee, compressing it to 19.6 hours, and in March it was compressed to about 17 hours. The holding capacity was also reduced to less than 2,000 vehicles. Not only was the production material guaranteed in a timely manner, but the reserve increased by 300,000 tons. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel said: "In the past, the blast furnace was not full, now the blast furnace can't finish eating." Truly achieving "using dragons to guarantee steel, using unloading to guarantee dragons." Thus, the cadres of the factory and mine realized: "To guarantee production, we must guarantee the dragon. Only by guaranteeing the dragon can we have high production."

    After Fushun Coal Mine carried out one-dragon transportation, large dragons hung on the line and small dragons formed groups. 80% of the empty dragons directly entered the mine, and all the heavy dragons reached the point of driving according to the line, basically achieving the goal of transporting out as much coal as was produced.

    After implementing one-dragon transportation connecting water and land, the turnover of vehicles and ships was accelerated, greatly shortening the running time of goods inside and outside the customs and transshipped at the port. On February 13th, a coal dragon departing from Jixi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province to Shanghai was shortened from eleven days to six days, achieving "direct loading of vehicles and ships, no goods landing on the ground." The employees of Dalian Port wrote such a poem of praise: The spring breeze blows with high morale, Road and port workers are busy dancing dragons; Steel dragons and coal dragons fly into the port, Directly transshipped to the ship; Vehicle and ship connection saves strength, Every second counts, all red!

    After promoting the "one-dragon" transportation experience, the work in the Shenyang railway hub area has also undergone significant changes. Special lines have realized a dragon network, and group loading has also increased; the utilization efficiency of small shunting trains has improved. This year, with such a large volume of traffic (27% more than the same period last year), Sujiatun Station is not congested and traffic is unimpeded, basically eliminating the phenomenon of "unable to unload, unable to load, unable to discharge." In the dragon-dancing competition, the employees of each department of our bureau compare their work to a part of the dragon: train dispatch is the dragon brain, the locomotive is the dragon head, the vehicle is the dragon body, the signal is the dragon eye, the line is the dragon road.... Everyone put forward the bold statement: "The dragon brain commands smartly, the dragon head shakes its power, the dragon body is strong and healthy, the dragon eyes are bright and clear, the dragon road is stable and flat, everyone protects the dragon," actively throwing themselves into the dragon-dancing competition. All this shows that the in-depth development of "one-dragon" transportation has increased the operation capacity and throughput capacity of both the road and the factory (mine, port), eased the tense situation of more goods than vehicles and transportation congestion, maintained smooth transportation, accelerated the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, met the needs of continuous leap forward in production, and guaranteed supply.

    From here, we can see that "one-dragon" transportation has a strong vitality, and the technical revolution movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading has created a material foundation for the revolution of transportation organization. It accelerates the turnover of vehicles and ships, effectively guarantees production, and enriches transportation organization science; it also changes people's mental outlook. If someone between the road and the factory says: "Your factory, our railway," or "Your railway, our factory," someone will definitely criticize him. Now, there is no distinction between you and me. We manage both production and transportation. Everyone considers the issue from the perspective of national interests, "leaving the difficulties to ourselves and giving the convenience to others." There is only one purpose, which is to accelerate socialist construction as soon as possible.

    Let's talk about the "passenger dragon." The passenger transportation "one dragon" was launched under the inspiration of the freight transportation "one dragon". Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the whole bureau has launched 12 railway, seaport, and highway intermodal transportation dragons, and 2 local dragons connecting railways and service departments. Currently, we are organizing a dragon network with stations and ports as the center, spanning rivers and seas, connecting urban and rural areas, and providing services for passengers in all directions.

    The Dalian Railway Office and Dalian Seaport, Tram Company, Transportation Company, Hotel General Store, Catering General Store, and other units launched a "one-dragon" service competition. When the train from Shenyang to Dalian reaches Dashiqiao, the train starts registering passengers who are changing to ships, taking buses, and staying in hotels in Dalian, and issues "dragon tickets." With this ticket, they are given special consideration in dining, picking up luggage, and applying for sleeping berths. Some trains also have "dragon cars." Passengers with "dragon tickets" can also go to the "dragon car" to rest. When the train arrives in Dalian, someone will pick them up. The elderly, young, sick, and disabled passengers can also receive better care. In the past, some people said, "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to go out." Now it is "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's better to go out than home." An old man named Wang, seventy-two years old, from Wendeng County, Shandong Province, said: "I bought a boat ticket on the train, saving me from running around everywhere after getting off the train. This is my first time in my life.... Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can there be such a good thing." Some passengers wrote poems saying: "Service work blooms red flowers, Everyone praises sitting on the 'dragon car', Changing ships and staying in hotels are all convenient, Thoughtful care is better than home."

    Both the freight "one-dragon" and the passenger "one-dragon" are the result of carrying out mass movements on a large scale under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism. They are both products of the Great Leap Forward, a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a concrete application of Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution on the transportation front. Facts have proven that the deeper the socialist revolution, the more developed the communist cooperation, and the faster the speed of socialist construction in our country.

    Socialist construction in our country has entered a new stage. As one of the national industrial bases, Liaoning has seen a new situation of better and more comprehensive leap forward since the beginning of spring. This new situation has brought new tasks to our railway transportation work. In order to realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year and the continuous leap forward in the entire 1960s, our railway bureau is widely and deeply carrying out a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works; under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, we are launching a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on transportation as the key, mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, advancing towards a dragon network. At the end of March, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee held an on-site conference on loading and unloading mechanization, semi-mechanization, and "one-dragon" transportation cooperation in Anshan City, which greatly promoted the transportation work of our bureau. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party, to make a big fuss over the "two dragons," consolidate and improve the "cargo dragon," organize and develop the "passenger dragon," vigorously promote loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization, give new equipment to old dragons, new guns to old soldiers, and march forward along the direction pointed out by the Party, resolutely completing the national transportation plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, climbing the peak of the revolution in transportation organization work, and planting the red flag of "one-dragon" transportation cooperation.

    I wish the conference a complete success, and I wish all the representatives good health!

    大闹“两条龙”
    一条“货龙”：产、供、运、销，环环相扣，一线相连
    一条“客龙”：站、车、店、船，步步相接，一票到家
    李锡奎、孙孝菊、郑锡坤代表谈铁路客货运技术革新主席团、各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，并保证一定在今后工作中，认真贯彻执行。
    这里，我们把沈阳铁路局和鞍钢、抚矿、大连港等兄弟企业以及地方服务行业共同大闹共产主义协作，组织客运、货运“两条龙”的情况向大会做一汇报。
    我们沈阳铁路局担负着全国铁路八分之一左右的货运量和五分之一的客运量。是钢煤二都的门户、水陆交通的枢纽、国际联运的要道，构成了保煤、保钢、保转港的运输网。运输任务非常繁重。1958年大跃进以来，运输能力不敷运输量需要的矛盾更加突出，我们遵照毛主席的不断革命的原理，运用全党全民办运输的方针，经过全体职工的努力，解决了这个矛盾，并超额完成了党和国家交给我们的运输任务，取得1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进。1959年比1949年货运量增长九倍，客运量增长五倍。进入六十年代的第一个春天，又实现了开门红、月月红、首季满堂红，打破了许多常规，创造了无数奇迹。由于国民经济高速度地发展，运输仍然是国民经济发展中的薄弱环节。但是我们一定千方百计地提高和扩大运输能力，满足国民经济发展对运输的要求。我局十万职工和二十万家属向党保证：国家有多少任务，就坚决完成多少任务。大跃进中我们体会到，任务越重干劲越大；干劲越大，办法越多；干劲大了，办法多了，信心也就更足了。我们的主要办法是大搞群众运动，大挖运输潜力，以运输为纲，大闹运输设备革命和运输组织革命。在大搞群众运动中，出现了“两条龙”：一条是产、供、运、销，环环相扣，一线相连的货物运输线——“货龙”；一条是站、车、店、船，步步相接，“一票到家”的旅客运输线——“客龙”。
    我们先说说“货龙”。在党的领导下，几年来我局和兄弟企业大大加强了共产主义协作，取得了很多经验，在煤铁之城——本溪市插起了全国路厂运输协作红旗。去年10月，在大搞“红旗列车”、“技术表演赛”的基础上，又学习与推广了秦皇岛“一条龙”运输经验。根据我们所处的位置和所负担的任务，共同组织了横跨数省，水陆衔接的大龙一百多条，遍及厂矿深入地方的小龙一千多条，基本实现了龙网化。形成了大龙带小龙，小龙保大龙，群龙飞舞，处处协作的局面。广大职工人人论龙，人人爱龙。路、厂、矿、港，各级党组织对一条龙运输非常重视，都把这项工作提到党委的重要议事日程上来。书记挂帅，亲自抓龙；成立了“一条龙”运输指挥部；制订了龙图；专设了“龙台”；组织了“保龙”突击队、“生龙”促进队和“迎龙”、“送龙”宣传队；树立了舞龙标兵。路、厂、矿、港开展了大兵团、多兵种的一条龙联合技术表演赛。打破了一切路界、厂界、矿界、港界，把运输业内部的生产活动，扩大到一切与运输有关的部门，把路内外所有的运输力量，按照统一的运输作业过程组织起来，大大挖掘了运输潜力，实现了生产运输双丰收。
    过去鞍钢运输的发展赶不上生产的发展，在钢铁产量大幅度增产的情况下，造成了运输堵塞，影响生产任务的完成。针对这种情况，鞍钢在加强技术改造的同时，积极推广了一条龙运输经验，在路厂“十统一”的基础上，组织干线龙四十六条，并组织了六百多条定时、定线、定量、定品种的厂内小龙，铁路干线龙直出直入。提出了：“一条龙，保生产，两千辆，二十点”的口号，开展了小龙保大龙，大龙带小龙，上下交错，内外结合的龙网化运输群众运动。从而建立了新的运输秩序，促进了生产跃进，生产的不断跃进也进一步提高了运输组织工作，使生产运输一齐跃进，今年2月一次作业时间突破了省委规定二十小时的指标，压缩到十九点六小时，3月份又压缩到十七小时左右。保有量也压缩到二千辆以下。不仅及时保证了生产用料，而且使储备量增多了三十万吨，鞍钢的工人说：“过去高炉吃不饱，现在高炉吃不了”。真正做到了“以龙保钢，以卸保龙”。因而使厂矿干部体会到：“要想保产，必须保龙，只有保龙，才能高产”。
    抚顺煤矿开展一条龙运输之后，大龙挂线，小龙成群，有80％的空龙直接入矿，重龙全部达到按线开车，基本上做到了生产多少煤就运出多少煤。
    实行水陆相衔接的一条龙运输以后，加速了车船周转，使关内外，转港货物大大缩短运行时间。2月13日从黑龙江省鸡西煤矿开往上海的一列煤龙，由十一天缩短到六天。做到了
  “车船直装，货不落地”。大连港的职工写出了这样赞美的诗歌：春风吹来斗志昂，路港职工舞龙忙；钢龙煤龙飞进港，直接换装到船上；车船衔接省力量，分秒必争红满堂。
    推行“一条龙”运输经验以后，沈阳铁路枢纽区的工作，也起了显著变化。专用线实现了龙网化，成组装车也增多了；小运转列车的运用效率提高了。今年这样大的运量（比去年同期增加27％），苏家屯站不别不堵，通行无阻。基本上消灭了“卸不下、装不上、排不出”的现象。在舞龙竞赛中，我局各部门职工都把自己的工作比作龙的一部分，列车调度是龙脑，机车是龙头，车辆是龙身，信号是龙眼，线路是龙道……。大家提出：“龙脑指挥灵，龙头抖威风，龙身健又壮，龙眼亮又明，龙道稳又平，人人都保龙”的豪言壮语，积极投入舞龙竞赛热潮。这些，都说明“一条龙”运输的深入发展，增大了路厂（矿、港）双方的作业能力和通过能力，缓和了货多车少运输拥塞的紧张局面，维护了运输的畅通，加速了车船货周转，满足了生产持续大跃进的需要，保证了供应。
    由这里可以看出，“一条龙”运输具有强大生命力，装卸机械化半机械化的技术革命运动，又给运输组织工作革命，创造了物质基础。它加速了车船周转，有力地保证了生产，丰富了运输组织学；它还改变了人们的精神面貌。如果在路厂间有人说：“你们工厂，我们铁路”，或者说：“你们铁路，我们工厂”，一定会有人批评他。现在已经不分你我，既管生产，又管运输，大家都从国家利益出发来考虑问题，“困难留给自己，方便让给别人”，目的只有一个，就是为了尽快地加速社会主义建设。
    再说“客龙”。客运“一条龙”是在货运“一条龙”的启发下搞起来的。在省市委领导下，全局已经搞起了铁路、海港、公路联运龙十二条，铁路和服务部门相衔接的地方龙两条。目前正以站、港为中心，组织横跨江海，联系城乡，四通八达为旅客服务的龙网。
    大连铁路办事处和大连海港、电车公司、运输公司、旅馆业总店、饮食业总店等单位开展“一条龙”服务工作竞赛，从沈阳开往大连的火车一走到大石桥，列车上就开始登记到大连换船、坐车、住店的旅客，办理“龙票”，拿着这张票，在就餐、领取行李、办理卧铺等方面都给予照顾。有的列车还有“龙厢”，拿“龙票”的旅客还可以到“龙厢”去休息。火车一到大连，就有专人来接。老、幼、病、残旅客，还能得到较好的照顾。从前有人说“在家千日好、出门事事难”。现在是“在家千日好、出门胜于家”。山东省文登县有一位七十二岁的王老大爷说：“在火车上就买到了船票，省得我下车到处跑了，这是我有生以来第一次……。只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能有这样好事。”有的旅客作诗说：“服务工作开红花，坐上‘龙车’人人夸，换船住店都方便，照顾周到胜于家”。
    货运“一条龙”和客运“一条龙”都是在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，大搞群众运动的结果，都是大跃进的产物，是毛泽东思想的胜利，也是毛主席不断革命论的思想在交通运输战线上的具体运用。事实证明，社会主义革命越深入，共产主义协作就越发展，我国社会主义建设速度也就越快。
    我国社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的阶段，做为全国工业基地之一的辽宁，开春以来就出现了更好、更全面跃进的新形势。这个新形势给我们铁路运输工作带来了新任务。为实现今年更好、更全面的跃进和实现今后整个六十年代的持续跃进，我们铁路局正广泛深入地开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动；在毛泽东思想领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的以运输为纲，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心，向龙网化进军的技术革新和技术革命运动。3月底，辽宁省委又在鞍山市召开了装卸机械化、半机械化和“一条龙”运输大协作现场会议，这又大大推动了我局的运输工作。我们决心在党的领导下，大闹“两条龙”，巩固和提高“货龙”，组织和发展“客龙”，大搞装卸机械化和半机械化，长龙新装，老兵新枪，沿着党所指引的方向大步前进，坚决提前和超额完成国家运输计划。攀登运输组织工作革命的高峰，插上“一条龙”运输大协作的红旗。
    祝大会胜利成功，祝各位代表身体健康！
