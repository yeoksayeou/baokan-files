Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, I express my heartfelt support. I feel that a magnificent picture of our country's continued comprehensive Great Leap Forward is unfolding before our eyes, and I am greatly educated and inspired. I am determined to make my greatest effort in my work position to realize the tasks proposed in these reports.

I am a person who has committed serious political errors. I am grateful to the Party and the masses for their patient education and help over the years, which have given me the courage and determination to thoroughly transform my position and ideology. After reviewing my mistakes, the Party assigned me to a new job, still engaging in scientific research, and has continuously given me meticulous care and consideration in politics, work, and life, fully embodying the Party's great policy of unity–criticism–unity towards intellectuals, making me deeply feel the Party's kindness and warmth. In fact, from the day of liberation, I have always been bathed in this kindness and warmth, but I was unaware of the good fortune I was in and realized it too late, failing to live up to the Party's painstaking efforts for many years.

In the nearly two years since I took on my new job, our country has experienced a series of historically significant and profound changes on the political, economic, and ideological fronts. In particular, since 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have held high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and brought into play their soaring drive, so that our country's socialist construction has advanced by leaps and bounds at a speed of one day equaling twenty years, fundamentally changing the backward face of the past century. The industrial system has been basically established, and agricultural production is advancing rapidly towards mechanization. The people of the whole country are full of vigor, leaping forward again and again, it is truly a scene of ten thousand horses galloping and a hundred flowers blooming! Countless facts that I personally witnessed in Gansu, Qinghai, Beijing, Shanghai and other places in connection with my work, as well as countless amazing miracles that I saw and heard every day from newspapers, magazines, and broadcasts, could not help but deeply move and inspire me. As an old intellectual who had long seen the poverty and weakness of the country in the old society, I also dreamed of the prosperity and strength of the country day and night. Now, after only a short ten years, a brand-new and strong motherland has stood tall in the world, how can I not sincerely admire the Party's wise, great, and correct leadership, and thus deeply appreciate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system?

Secondly, through the movement to criticize bourgeois academic thought and the study of the Party's guidelines and policies on scientific work—the Chinese way of developing science—I have further realized that my past mistakes of blindly believing in experts, blindly believing in books, blindly believing in foreigners, and neglecting the masses, being divorced from the masses, and even attempting to detach myself from and resist the leadership of the Party, had caused such huge losses to the part of scientific work I was responsible for. In the past two years, the vast number of workers, peasants, and young intellectuals in our country, under the leadership of the Party, have broken superstitions, carried forward the communist style of daring to think and act, and made countless inventions and creations in science and technology, which have greatly enlightened me and made me infinitely admire and be convinced. For example, when the leadership ordered me to be responsible for the preparatory work of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now known as the Lanzhou Branch) in 1954, I often expressed that the Northwest lacked senior researchers and believed that research work could not be carried out. Later, I even went so far as to resolutely advocate the abolition and merger of existing research offices. However, after clearing up my bourgeois expert line in 1957 and 1958 and establishing the absolute leadership of the Party, the Lanzhou Branch rapidly achieved great development and made many outstanding achievements in a very short period of one or two years. The most prominent is that the Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the theory and school of "continental strata generating petroleum" which exceeds international levels by twenty young geological scientific researchers, which will have inestimable significance for our country's economic construction and world geological science. It can be asserted that if the absolute leadership of the Party had not been strengthened and I was still in charge, and the work was carried out according to my bourgeois scientific line that only saw "experts" and not the masses, only believed in "authority" and not in young people, such rapid development and great achievements of the Lanzhou Branch would definitely not have been possible.

For example, from the field of my own specialty (veterinary medicine), recalling that when I was engaged in some administrative work in the Northwest District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department in the early days of liberation, foot-and-mouth disease often prevailed in various provinces in the Northwest, but at that time we lacked very effective prevention and control methods, and the work was very passive, and we had little certainty as to when this epidemic could be eradicated. However, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a lecture meeting on foot-and-mouth disease in Lanzhou, where Soviet experts gave short lectures, and young veterinary scientists from many provinces participated in the study. After the end of the lecture meeting, these young veterinary scientists conducted a large amount of research work in various places. In a short period of more than a year, they not only identified the types of foot-and-mouth disease prevalent in our country, but also made several vaccines with very good efficacy. Many research results have reached or exceeded the world level. Without the correct and strong leadership of the Party, such outstanding achievements would be unimaginable.

Recalling that when I participated in drafting our country's twelve-year science plan in 1956, although the plan was drafted, I always had many doubts in my mind as to whether it could be completed within twelve years; especially I felt dissatisfied with the fact that the Science Planning Commission of the State Council was led by the Vice Premier who was not a scientist, and even arrogantly proposed at the Academic Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957 the absurd proposal to abolish the Science Planning Commission and hand over its business to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the essence of which was a kind of thinking that the Party could not lead science. However, the practice in the past few years has fully proved that under the strong leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of the national scientific community and the broad masses, it can already be asserted that the twelve-year science plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule, completely crushing my reactionary argument that the Party cannot lead science, and thus also strengthened my determination to absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, rely on the enthusiasm of the masses and young people to do a good job in research work and technical innovation and technical revolution.

The recent rectification and study of opposing rightists and boosting enthusiasm has educated me even more profoundly, making me realize that in the entire transition period, the contradiction between the bourgeois world outlook and the proletarian world outlook is still the main contradiction, the struggle between the two roads has not been extinguished by far, and I deeply feel that in such an era of rapid development of the objective situation, it is necessary to carry out constant ideological revolution in order to avoid being abandoned by the wheels of the times. I am fully aware that my transformation has only just begun, and I must make arduous efforts to complete the transformation of my whole being. I resolutely and wholeheartedly listen to the Party's words, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly change my position, resolutely break with the bourgeois world outlook, establish the proletarian world outlook, eliminate various forms of individualism, continuously temper and transform myself in various political movements, scientific practice, and productive labor, and dedicate all my strength to the cause of socialist construction to repay the Party's education and love for me.

### 思想不断革命才不致被时代车轮抛弃  盛彤笙委员的发言

    思想不断革命才不致被时代车轮抛弃
    盛彤笙委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在听了李富春、李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告以后，我表示衷心的拥护，感觉我国社会主义建设的一幅继续全面大跃进的宏伟图景正呈现在我们的眼前，受到极大的教育和鼓舞。我决心在自己的工作岗位上为实现这些报告所提出的任务而作出最大的努力。
    我是一个犯过严重政治错误的人，感谢几年来党和群众对我的耐心教育和帮助，使我有勇气和决心进行立场和思想的彻底改造。在检讨了我的错误以后，党又分配了我新的工作岗位，仍旧担任科学研究工作，并且在政治上、工作上和生活上不断地给了我以无微不至的关怀和照顾，充分体现了党对知识分子的团结——批评——团结的伟大方针，使我深切地感到党的慈祥和温暖。其实早从解放那一天起，我原就是始终沐浴在这种慈祥和温暖之中的，但是人在福中不知福，我是体会得太迟了，也太辜负多年来党对我的一片苦心了。
    在我走上新的工作岗位以来的将近两年的时间中，我国在政治战线、经济战线和思想战线上又经历了一系列的具有历史意义的深刻变化。特别是1958年以来，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，发挥冲天干劲，使我国社会主义建设以一天等于二十年的速度飞跃前进，根本改变了近百年来的落后面貌。工业体系已经基本上建立起来，农业生产正向着机械化前途猛进。全国人民意气风发，跃进再跃进，真是万马奔腾，百花竞放！我在甘肃、青海、北京、上海等地结合自己的工作所亲眼见到的无数事实，以及每天从报纸、杂志、广播上所看到听到无数惊人奇迹，不能不使我受到深刻的感动和激励。作为一个旧知识分子，在旧社会中长期见到国家的贫困和衰弱，也是无日不梦想国家的繁荣和富强的。现在仅仅经过短短的十年时间，一个崭新的强盛的祖国已经屹立于世界，怎能使我不由衷地敬服党的领导的英明、伟大和正确，从而深刻体会到社会主义制度的无比优越呢？
    其次是通过资产阶级学术思想批判运动和党关于科学工作的方针政策——中国式发展科学的道路的学习，使我进一步认识到我过去迷信专家，迷信书本，迷信外国和轻视群众，脱离群众，甚至企图脱离和抗拒党的领导的严重错误，曾使我所负担的部分科学工作蒙受何等巨大的损失。最近两年来我国广大工农群众和知识青年，在党的领导下破除迷信，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在科学技术上作出的无数发明创造，使我受到极大的启发，也使我无限的钦佩和折服。例如当1954年领导上命我担任中国科学院西北分院（现称兰州分院）的筹备工作的时候，我经常表示西北缺乏高级研究人员，认为研究工作无法开展，后来甚至发展到坚决主张将有的研究室撤消合并。但是在1957年和1958年清算了我这种资产阶级专家路线，树立了党的绝对领导以后，兰州分院就迅速得到了很大的发展，并且在很短的一两年中作出了许多优异的成绩，最突出的是中国科学院兰州地质研究所由二十几个青年地质科学研究人员创造出了超过国际水平的“陆相地层生成石油”的理论和学派，对我国经济建设和世界地质科学都将有不可估量的意义。可以断言，假若没有加强党的绝对领导而还由我担任领导，并且按照我那种只看见“专家”，看不见群众，只相信“权威”，不相信青年的资产阶级科学路线进行工作的话，兰州分院的这样迅速的发展和巨大的成就肯定都是不可能的。
    又例如从我自己的专业（兽医学）的领域来说，回忆解放初期我担任西北区畜牧兽医部分行政工作的时候，西北各省常有口蹄疫的流行，当时我们却缺乏很有效的防治方法，工作非常被动，对于何时才能扑灭这种疫病很少把握。但是在大跃进的1958年，中国农业科学院在兰州举办了一次口蹄疫讲习会，由苏联专家作了短期的讲学，有许多省份的青年兽医科学工作者参加学习。讲习会结束以后，这些青年兽医科学工作者就在各地进行了大量的研究工作，在短短的一年多的时间中，不仅已将我国流行的口蹄疫的型别鉴定清楚，而且制出了几种效力很好的疫苗，其中许多项研究成果已达到或超过世界水平。若是没有党的正确和坚强的领导，这样优异的成绩也是不可设想的。
    回忆1956年我参加草拟我国十二年科学规划的时候，尽管规划是脱稿了，但是究竟能不能在十二年之内完成，我心中总存在有许多怀疑；尤其是对国务院科学规划委员会由非科学家的副总理领导感觉不服气，甚至在1957年的科学院学部委员会上狂妄地提出了取消科学规划委员会，将它的业务交给中国科学院来担任的荒谬主张，其实质就是一种认为党不能领导科学的思想。但是几年来的实践充分证明，在党的坚强领导和全国科学界及广大群众的共同努力之下，已经可以断言，十二年科学规划肯定能够提前完成，完全粉碎了我那种认为党不能领导科学的反动论点，从而也坚定了我要绝对服从党的领导，依靠群众和青年的积极性来搞好研究工作和技术革新与技术革命的决心。
    最近的反右倾、鼓干劲的整风学习对我的教育更为深刻，使我认识到在整个过渡时期中，资产阶级世界观和无产阶级世界观之间的矛盾还是最主要的矛盾，两条道路的斗争还远远没有熄灭，痛切地感觉到在这样一个客观形势一日千里地飞跃发展的时代，必须进行思想的不断革命，才不致被时代的车轮所抛弃。我完全意识到我的改造还才开始，要完成脱胎换骨的改造还必须付出艰苦的努力。我坚决一心一意地听党的话，加强马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作的学习，彻底转变立场，坚决与资产阶级世界观决裂，树立无产阶级的世界观，肃清各种形式的个人主义思想，在各项政治运动、科学实践和生产劳动中不断锻炼和改造自己，并为社会主义建设事业献出我的全部力量，来报答党对我的教育和爱护。
