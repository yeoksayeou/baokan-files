Comrades:

The National Militia Representative Conference is now open!

This is a conference of historical significance. Convening a militia representative conference of such scale on a national scale is not only the first in the ten years since the founding of the country, but also unprecedented in the history of the Chinese revolution. The convening of this conference marks a new stage in the development of my country's militia building, and marks the great victory of Mao Zedong's military thought. Without a doubt, it will become an important milestone in the history of the development of our country's militia.

The representatives attending this conference include heroic sons and daughters from all fronts of the country. Some of you are advanced workers who are constantly creating miracles on the industrial and agricultural fronts; some are militia heroes who cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and public security departments to defend land and sea borders, capture special agents, protect production, and maintain social order; some are young students who are working hard to climb the peak of science and culture; some are outstanding children of various ethnic groups from border areas; some are demobilized, transferred, and retired soldiers who play a backbone role in militia building; and there are also a group of specially invited representatives, who are old Red Guards, Young Pioneers, and militia comrades with outstanding achievements in the past war years, as well as representatives of the People's Liberation Army who stand on the front lines of national defense and defend the motherland. You are all builders of the socialist cause and defenders of the socialist cause, and you are standard-bearers who are marching forward with the red flag of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought. Let me extend a warm welcome and cordial greetings to you.

Our country's militia has a long history and a glorious tradition. In the successive revolutionary wars, the reason why we were able to defeat enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment and achieve great revolutionary victories was mainly because we followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and implemented the people's war that combined main forces, local forces, and militia, and combined armed and unarmed masses. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war is the thought that comes from the people's armed struggle and goes to the people's armed struggle. The militia best embodies the universality of the people's war. We not only relied on the militia and the regular army to cooperate in combat to defeat powerful enemies at home and abroad, but also relied on the militia to develop and strengthen the People's Liberation Army, and to defend and consolidate the revolutionary base areas. The militia has made tremendous contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people.

In the ten years since the founding of the country, our country's militia building has also made significant achievements. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and under the great call of Chairman Mao to run militia divisions in a big way, with the great leap forward in production and the emergence of people's communes with strong vitality, the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous upsurge of running militia divisions in a big way. In a very short time, from rural people's communes to urban factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools, militia divisions or militia regiments have been generally established. This is a major event of far-reaching historical significance. It has greatly accelerated our country's economic construction and national defense construction. Practice has proved that these thousands of militia divisions and regiments have become the main force and shock force on the production front, and have become a powerful force for promoting the high-speed development of our country's socialist construction. In the past two years, the militia in various places has played a huge role in water conservancy construction, large-scale steelmaking, deep plowing of land, fighting drought and draining waterlogging, achieving high yields, technical innovation, and technical revolution movements. The militia, which is both a military organization and a labor organization, can not only fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people for production and greatly improve labor efficiency; but also facilitate the organization of cooperation, implement large-scale operations, and better complete shock tasks. On the national defense front, the militia has also played an important role. They have made immortal achievements in defending land and sea borders, capturing airborne special agents, quelling armed rebellions, and maintaining social order. At the same time, the militia in various places have also widely carried out socialist education and martial arts activities, which has significantly strengthened the political consciousness and national defense concepts of the broad masses of the militia, and continuously improved their military knowledge. They can both produce and fight, and are both a labor army and a powerful force for defending the motherland. It can be said that with a powerful People's Liberation Army mastering modern military technology, and with such a powerful mass armed force, our national defense has truly become an impregnable wall. We are not afraid of any imperialist threats and aggression.

The task of our conference is to further mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of militia across the country, raise the socialist and communist consciousness of the militia, carry forward the glorious tradition of the militia, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's military thought, and give full play to the role of being a military organization, as well as a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization, to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland and strengthen national defense construction.

Before the convening of this conference, a new situation of running militia divisions in a big way has emerged throughout the country. After universal development and key rectification, the militia organizations in many regions have been further consolidated and developed. The enthusiasm of various regions in running militia divisions in a big way is very high and their enthusiasm is very high, and it should be persisted. In order to do a better job in militia work, it is also necessary to pay attention to work methods. All activities of the militia must be centered on the development of production. It is necessary to pay attention to obeying production, centering on production, and focusing on production. Militia work must be under the unified leadership of the local party committees, and the cooperative relations with trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Sports Commission, the Women's Federation, the education departments, and other aspects must be effectively handled.

The militia in various places must continue to work hard to study Mao Zedong Thought, learn production knowledge, scientific knowledge, and military knowledge, and vigorously carry out sports activities. Our militia organization must also be vigorously developed. All qualified people must be absorbed into the militia organization. The city is the center of politics, economy, and culture, and it is also the place where the working class is concentrated. Therefore, the militia work in the city should develop with the development of the urban people's commune, and focus on factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions to cultivate a large number of national defense technology reserve forces. The People's Liberation Army has always regarded the militia as its closest comrades-in-arms and brothers; in the future, it should be more concerned about the construction of the militia, and more actively pass on its military skills and good traditions to the militia.

Comrades! At present, the situation in the country is very good. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist construction has achieved great victories in continuous leaps forward in the past two years. The 1960 national economic plan is another magnificent plan for continuing the leap forward. We may strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less time than ten years, and complete the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule. At present, the whole country is vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, urban people's communization, running public canteens well, vigorously carrying out patriotic health campaigns, and supporting agricultural production. These movements are of great significance for further consolidating and developing the people's commune system, promoting the sustained leap forward of the national economy, and changing the spiritual outlook of the people. The current international situation is also very conducive to our country's socialist construction. The east wind continues to prevail over the west wind. The strength of the socialist camp has surpassed the strength of imperialism, and the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war, forcing the US ruling clique to make some appeasing gestures. However, imperialism is still imperialism. Their aggressive nature has not changed. It is absolutely impossible for them to "lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot." US imperialism is continuing to expand its arms and prepare for war under the guise of "peace," actively developing missiles and establishing missile bases, still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and actively supporting Japanese militarism, seriously threatening our country's security. Therefore, this cannot but arouse our high vigilance.

Comrades! The convening of our conference is of great significance. It is hoped that all representatives can deeply understand the tasks and significance of this conference, conscientiously exchange experiences, humbly learn, and work together to make this conference a success. This conference is a mobilization meeting to accelerate socialist construction. We believe that through this conference, hundreds of millions of militia across the country will be more high-spirited and full of energy, hold high the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and strive to build our beloved motherland into a powerful socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense!

I wish the conference a complete success!

    高举毛泽东军事思想红旗  发挥民兵组织的四大作用
    罗荣桓元帅在全国民兵代表会议上的开幕词同志们：
    全国民兵代表会议现在开幕了！
    这是一次具有历史意义的大会。在全国范围召开如此规模的民兵代表会议，不仅是建国十年来的第一次，在中国革命历史上也是空前的。这次大会的召开，标志着我国的民兵建设事业进入了一个新阶段，标志着毛泽东军事思想的伟大胜利。毫无疑问，它将成为我国民兵发展史上一个重要的里程碑。
    出席这次大会的代表，包括来自全国各个战线的英雄儿女，你们有的是在工农业战线上不断创造奇迹的先进工作者；有的是配合人民解放军和公安部门保卫陆海边防、捕捉特务、保卫生产、维护治安的民兵英雄；有的是正在刻苦钻研努力攀登科学文化高峰的青年学生；有的是来自边疆地区的各兄弟民族的优秀子弟；有的是在民兵建设中起骨干作用的复员、转业、退伍军人；还有一批特邀代表，是过去战争年代功勋卓著的老赤卫队员、少年先锋队员和民兵同志，还有站在国防前线捍卫祖国的人民解放军代表。你们都是社会主义事业的建设者，又是社会主义事业的保卫者，是高举党的总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗阔步前进的旗手。让我向你们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。
    我国民兵有着悠久的历史和光荣的传统。在历次革命战争中，我们所以能以劣势装备战胜优势的敌人，获得伟大的革命胜利，主要是遵循毛泽东同志的指示，实行主力部队、地方部队和民兵相结合，武装群众和非武装群众相结合的人民战争。毛泽东同志的人民战争思想就是从人民武装斗争中来又到人民武装斗争中去的思想。民兵最能体现人民战争的广泛性。我们不仅在对敌斗争中，依靠民兵和正规军配合作战，打败了国内外强大的敌人，而且还依靠民兵发展和壮大了人民解放军，保卫和巩固了革命根据地。民兵对我国人民的解放事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    建国十年来，我国的民兵建设又取得了重大的成就。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛主席大办民兵师的伟大号召下，随着生产大跃进和具有强大生命力的人民公社的出现，全国人民更掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的大办民兵师的高潮。很短时间，从农村人民公社，到城市厂矿、企业、机关、学校，都普遍地建立起民兵师或民兵团。这是一件具有深远历史意义的大事。它大大加速了我国的经济建设和国防建设。实践证明，这些成千上万的民兵师团，已经成为生产战线上的主力军和突击队，成为促进我国社会主义建设高速度发展的一支强大力量。两年来，各地民兵在兴修水利、大炼钢铁、深翻土地、抗旱排涝、高额丰产、技术革新和技术革命运动中，都发挥了巨大的威力。民兵，这种既是军事组织又是劳动组织，不仅可以充分调动广大劳动人民的生产积极性，大大提高劳动效率；而且便于组织协作，实行大兵团作战，更好地完成突击任务。在国防战线上，民兵同样发挥了重要的作用。他们在保卫陆海边防、捕捉空降特务、平定武装叛乱、维持社会治安等斗争中，都立下了不朽的功迹。同时，各地民兵，还广泛地开展了社会主义教育和练武活动，这就使广大民兵的政治觉悟和国防观念显著加强，军事知识不断提高。他们既能生产，又会打仗，既是一支劳动大军，又是保卫祖国的强大力量。完全可以这样说，有了一支强大的掌握现代军事技术的人民解放军，又有了这样一支强大的群众武装力量，我们的国防就真正成为铜墙铁壁。我们就不怕任何帝国主义的威胁和侵略。
    我们这次大会的任务，就是为了要进一步调动全国亿万民兵的革命积极性，提高民兵的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，发扬民兵的光荣传统，更高地举起毛泽东军事思想的红旗，高度发挥既是军事组织，又是劳动组织、教育组织、体育组织的作用，加速祖国的社会主义建设和加强国防建设。
    这次大会召开以前，全国各地已经出现一个大办民兵师的新局面。不少地区的民兵组织经过普遍发展和重点整顿以后，得到进一步的巩固和发展。各地区大办民兵师的劲头很大，热情很高，应该坚持下去。为了把民兵工作做得更好，还需要很好地注意工作方法。民兵的一切活动，必须以发展生产为中心。一定要注意服从生产、围绕生产和落脚于生产。民兵工作一定要在地方党委的统一领导下，并切实搞好与工会、共青团、体委、妇联、教育部门等各方面的协作关系。
    各地民兵要继续努力学习毛泽东思想，学习生产知识、科学知识、军事知识，和大搞体育活动。我们的民兵组织还要大力发展。一切符合条件的人都要吸收他们到民兵组织中来。城市是政治、经济、文化的中心，又是工人阶级集中的地方，因此，城市的民兵工作应该随着城市人民公社的发展而发展，并以工厂、企业、学校、机关为重点，培养大量国防技术后备力量。人民解放军过去一直把民兵当作是自己最亲密的战友和兄弟看待；今后，应该更加关心民兵的建设，更积极地把自己的军事本领和优良作风传授给民兵。
    同志们！目前，全国的形势非常好。我国的社会主义建设，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，两年来获得了连续大跃进的伟大胜利。1960年国民经济计划又是继续跃进的宏伟计划。我们可能争取用比十年更少的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国，并且提前两三年完成全国农业发展纲要。现在，全国正轰轰烈烈地开展技术革新和技术革命、城市人民公社化、办好公共食堂、大搞爱国卫生和支援农业生产等运动。这些运动，对于进一步巩固发展人民公社制度、促进国民经济持续大跃进和改变人民的精神面貌，都有伟大意义。目前的国际形势，也非常有利于我国的社会主义建设，东风继续压倒西风，社会主义阵营的力量已经超过了帝国主义的力量，和平力量已经超过了战争力量，迫使美国统治集团，不得不作某些和缓的表示。但是，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，他们的侵略本性没有改变，他们绝不可能“放下屠刀，立地成佛”。美帝国主义正以“和平”为幌子，继续扩军备战，积极发展导弹和建立导弹基地，仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，并积极扶植日本军国主义，严重威胁我国的安全。因此，这不能不引起我们高度的警惕。
    同志们！我们大会的召开具有重大的意义，希望全体代表都能深刻了解这次大会的任务和意义，认真交流经验，虚心学习，共同努力开好这次会议。这次会议，是一个加速社会主义建设的誓师大会。我们相信，通过这次大会，全国亿万民兵必将更加意气风发，干劲冲天，高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，为把我们可爱的祖国迅速建设成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国而奋斗！
    祝大会胜利成功！
