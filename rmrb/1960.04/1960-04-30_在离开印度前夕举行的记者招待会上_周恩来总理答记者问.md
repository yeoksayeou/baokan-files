Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 28th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a press conference at the Indian Presidential Palace from 10:30 PM on April 25th to 1:00 AM on April 26th.

More than 150 Indian and foreign journalists attended the conference. Premier Zhou first delivered a written statement (see April 26th issue), and then said that he was willing to answer any questions raised by the reporters. However, he hoped that their newspapers and news agencies would publish the full text or the entire content of the questions and answers in their respective publications. Major Chinese newspapers would also publish the full text and would publish it in the English "Beijing Review" so that each of them could receive a copy. The questions and answers are as follows:

S. P. Sabharwal, Indian journalist of the Japan News Syndicate: Your Excellency has invited Prime Minister Nehru to visit China. Has Mr. Nehru accepted the invitation?

Premier Zhou: Prime Minister Nehru told me that he would consider it based on the progress of the work of officials from both sides.

Raghvan, journalist of the Press Trust of India: In India, the letter you gave to Prime Minister Nehru has been published in full, but the letters Mr. Nehru gave to you have not been published in Chinese newspapers. Speaking of freedom of speech, are you prepared to allow Chinese newspapers to publish these letters in full?

Premier Zhou: This gentleman may not have read Chinese newspapers. Chinese newspapers have already published the full texts of the letters Mr. Nehru gave me and the letters I gave Mr. Nehru.

Chandra, journalist of the "Statesman" of India: I would like to ask what prevents you from returning to the situation on the border as it was a year or two ago, since the actions were taken a year or two ago.

Premier Zhou: On the Chinese side, these one or two years are the same as in the past. The Chinese government has never taken any action to change the status quo on the border.

Rangaswami, journalist of the "Hindu": In the negotiations, which section did the two prime ministers consider to have the greatest divergence?

Hope the Indian government will take the same attitude towards the western section as the Chinese government has taken in the eastern section.

Premier Zhou: There are disputes in both the eastern and western sections. The disputes in the middle section are relatively small.

In the eastern section, the boundary line drawn on our maps is south of the boundary line drawn on Indian maps. The area included in India on the Indian maps has long been under Chinese administrative jurisdiction. After India's independence, it gradually advanced to the line currently drawn on its maps. The Indian government asks us to recognize this line; sometimes, the Indian government even publicly says that this is the McMahon Line. We can never recognize this line, because it was illegally drawn by British imperialism in its secret exchanges with the local authorities of Tibet, China. Successive Chinese governments have never recognized this line. Nevertheless, we are willing to maintain the status quo before the Sino-Indian boundary issue is resolved, not to cross this line, and we will not propose territorial claims as a precondition when negotiating the boundary issue. Because we have adopted such an attitude of understanding and concession, the discussion of the eastern section of the boundary has taken less time.

In the western section, the way the boundary line is drawn on Chinese maps is inconsistent with that on Indian maps. Historically, the way Chinese maps drew this section of the boundary has been basically consistent, although there have been minor differences. However, Indian maps have changed many times. China has always implemented administrative jurisdiction according to the boundary line on Chinese maps, that is, from the Karakoram Pass, southeastward generally along the watershed of the Karakoram Mountains to the Kongka Pass, and then from the Kongka Pass southward to the vicinity of the Pardi River. The border area north and east of this line has historically belonged to Chinese jurisdiction. Most of it, including the Aksai Chin area, is under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang, China, and a small part belongs under the jurisdiction of Tibet. We have many historical documents and materials as proof of this historical administrative jurisdiction. After the founding of New China, we have always administered this area, regarding it as the main transportation route connecting southern Xinjiang and the Ali area of Tibet. Regarding this area, the way the boundary is drawn on Indian maps was similar to that on Chinese maps before the mid-19th century. From 1865 to 1943, the way the main Indian maps drew this section of the boundary was vague. In 1950, the official Indian map colored the outline of the section of the boundary that India now claims, but still marked this place as an undefined boundary. Finally, it was not until 1954 that it became the official drawing method of the map that you now see in Indian newspapers, just like the eastern section of the boundary. Therefore, even from the evolution of India's own maps over the past hundred years, it can be fully proved that the boundary of this area has not been delimited. We ask the Indian government to take the same attitude towards this area as the Chinese government has taken in the eastern section, that is, to retain its own position, agree to engage in negotiations, and not to cross the Chinese administrative jurisdiction line marked on Chinese maps. The Indian government does not fully agree with this issue. Therefore, there is a relatively large dispute. The two prime ministers also spent a particularly long time discussing this aspect.

In the middle section, there are also disputes, but those belong to individual places.

Verghese, journalist of the "Times of India": What demands does China have on Bhutan?

Premier Zhou: I'm very sorry, we have no demands or disputes with Bhutan. You will remember that the Chinese government mentioned twice in its letter to the Indian government that there are no boundary disputes between China and Sikkim and Bhutan, and that it respects the legitimate relationship between India and Sikkim and Bhutan.

Roy, journalist of the "Pakistan Times": Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala said that China is demanding Mount Everest. What is the situation?

Premier Zhou: Thank you for reminding me of this issue. We are going to Nepal tomorrow, and I believe we will resolve this issue in a very friendly manner.

Turan, journalist of the Press Trust of India: I mean, is it true that China believes that this mountain peak is Chinese?

Premier Zhou: The course of events is not as you know it. Because this belongs to diplomatic issues, I don't intend to announce the details of the talks between our two prime ministers here.

Atkinson, journalist of the British "Daily Mail": Are you pleased with your talks in Delhi? Because China has not given up an inch of land to India. I would like to remind Your Excellency that the basis for India's talks this time is to have China wash away its aggression.

Premier Zhou: China has never invaded the territory of any country, and has historically been invaded by others. Now China still has territory occupied by others, such as Taiwan. I am very pleased that the Chinese and Indian prime ministers fully agreed during the talks that neither side would raise territorial demands as a precondition for negotiations. This proves that the talks were conducted on a friendly basis. As for invading the land of others, this gentleman represents a British newspaper and will certainly know what places in China Britain still occupies.

Chaturvedi, journalist of the Hindi "Aaj": When the Indian government drew the Chinese government's attention to Chinese maps, the Chinese government once said that these were drawn during the Kuomintang era and had not been systematically and carefully surveyed. Once carefully surveyed, they would be revised. Is this true? Why didn't you raise the issue of maps during your first and second meetings with Nehru, but now you want to insist on China's demands based on Chinese history, and ask India to forget what happened during the British period?

Before the border is surveyed, negotiated, and delimited, unilaterally imposing one's own map on the other party is an unfriendly and unequal attitude.

Premier Zhou: Chinese maps are drawn based on the historical continuity of the situation. There are some discrepancies between some places and the actual administrative jurisdiction. We have always said this about this point. This is the case not only with India, but also with other neighboring countries. Conversely, the maps of other countries also have this situation where they border China. Therefore, we have repeatedly told Prime Minister Nehru that after both sides survey and delimit the border, we will modify our respective maps based on the agreement between the two sides. Regarding this point, the gentleman can find proof from the Sino-Burmese border agreement. That is to say, once we sign the Sino-Burmese border agreement, both parties must modify their own maps. But we must never unilaterally impose our own map on the other party before it is surveyed, negotiated, and delimited, and ask the other party to modify the map according to our requirements. This is not a friendly attitude, nor is it an equal attitude. Therefore, we cannot do this.

Bedi, journalist of "Link" Weekly: What is the situation in Longju?

Premier Zhou: Longju is north of the so-called McMahon Line. This is proven by historical materials, but the Indian government has said that Longju is south of the so-called McMahon Line and within its own jurisdiction.

Swarup, journalist of the "Hindustan Times": Do you get the impression from your talks with Indian leaders that there has been a great change in India, and that the Indian people's friendship and trust in the Chinese people is changing? Have you taken some very radical steps to change this situation?

The unity of the one billion people of China and India cannot be destroyed by any reactionary force.

Premier Zhou: I don't see it the way you do. I have already said in my written statement that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples is eternal, and the boundary dispute is temporary. There may be temporary estrangement in the process of negotiation and resolution between the two governments, but through this meeting, both sides have further increased their understanding. I believe that this temporary cloud will be eliminated, because there is no fundamental conflict of interest between the Chinese and Indian peoples. We were not only friendly in the past, but will be friendly for thousands of years to come. I would like to express to everyone present, especially to the broad masses of Indian people, that the Chinese people and the Chinese government have no territorial demands on India or any other country around China. We will never invade an inch of land of any country, and of course, we will not tolerate others invading us. As for Sino-Indian relations, I firmly believe that the temporary disputes on the border can be resolved, the peoples of the two countries will be friends forever, and the vast majority of Indian people's concept of being friendly to China has not changed. Not long ago, the Chinese agricultural exhibition in Delhi was appreciated and valued by the broad masses of Indian people, which shows this point. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the broad masses of Indian people through you. My colleagues and I can naturally do some work to promote Sino-Indian friendship, but the most important thing is the unity of the one billion people of the two great countries. This cannot be destroyed by any reactionary force.

Shepard, female journalist of the North American Newspaper Alliance and the Women's News Service: Would you consider inviting President Eisenhower to visit Beijing, but without requiring the United States to recognize Red China as a condition?

Premier Zhou: Your good intentions are negated by the conditions you put forward. Since the United States does not recognize New China, how can China invite the head of the United States, President Eisenhower, to visit Beijing?

She also asked: My second question is raised on behalf of the Women's News Service. As a 62-year-old person, you look exceptionally good. How do you take care of your health? Do you exercise regularly? Or do you have a special diet?

Premier Zhou: Thank you. I am an Easterner, and I live according to the Eastern way of life.

Wheeler, British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in Delhi: In your talks with Indian leaders, did they raise the issue of China's aggression against India? How did the two countries resolve such a fundamental difference in the talks? If this issue was not resolved in the talks between the two prime ministers, how can the officials' talks resolve it?

Premier Zhou: This is the idea of ​​Western imperialism. In this meeting, we did not raise such a question. If the heads of the Indian government raised such a question, it would not only be inconsistent with objective facts, but also unfriendly. I can only say that our two friendly countries are unwilling to satisfy the hopes of Western countries on this point.

Sharma, journalist of the "Assam Tribune": Given that the negotiations on the small place of Wure have been dragging on for three years without a resolution, have the two governments given their officials special instructions to speed up future talks?

Premier Zhou: Although the Wure issue has been in dispute for a long time, it has not caused conflict, and it will always be resolved. The joint communique has been published regarding the terms of reference for the talks between the officials of the two countries. Of course, in order to facilitate their work, the two governments will further give them instructions separately. The communique has expressed such a desire, hoping that the work of the officials of the two countries will be conducive to further consideration by the two governments to resolve the boundary issue.

Inderjit, journalist of the "Times of India": You said that one country should not impose its map on another country. In order to maintain the eternal friendship you mentioned, can you agree to neutralize the Ladakh region, as Prime Minister Nehru suggested?

Premier Zhou: Prime Minister Nehru did not insist on such a request in this meeting. If Prime Minister Nehru proposed that China withdraw from the Aksai Chin area, that is, the Ladakh you mentioned, then the Chinese government could also propose that India withdraw from the eastern section, that is, the area where there is a great difference in the way China and India draw the eastern section, how could the Indian government accept this? Of course, the Chinese government did not make such a proposal.

Bedi, journalist of "Link" Weekly: Can it be considered that your position has changed since the beginning of the negotiations?

Premier Zhou: China's position is to resolve the border dispute between the two countries in a friendly, fair and reasonable manner, and to reach a principled agreement first. This position has not changed, and as for specific issues, this meeting has not been able to touch on much.

Saxena, journalist of the Hindi "Naya Sansar": In addition to the border issue, did the two prime ministers raise some issues of grievance, such as the Tibet issue, the issue of political asylum for the Dalai Lama, and the issue of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? Have the Indian people and government done some things that have offended your feelings?

Tibet will always be a member of the big family of all ethnic groups in China, and any foreign interference in China's internal affairs is doomed to failure.

Premier Zhou: Mentioning the Tibet issue, the Dalai and mainly his followers rebelled in order to maintain the serf system in Tibet, but they failed and fled to India. In India, they were granted political asylum. This is the usual international practice, and we have no objection. However, their activities after arriving in India have exceeded this scope. The Indian government has repeatedly told the Chinese government that it will not allow the Dalai Lama and his followers to conduct any political activities against New China in India. However, the Dalai and his followers have carried out many activities against China in India and abroad. This is what we regret.

Tibet is a part of China, which is recognized by the Indian government. I can tell this gentleman that the vast majority of Tibetan people have now been liberated from the serf system, they have been given land, and they have carried out democratic reforms. Tibet's economy will continue to develop, the population will also increase, and it will always be a member of the big family of all ethnic groups in China. Any foreign interference in China's internal affairs is doomed to failure, and this behavior itself violates the Five Principles jointly advocated by China and India.

Friedenberg, journalist of the "Chicago Daily News": In your written statement tonight, you mentioned that both parties can maintain an actual line of control before resolving the issue. If a solution cannot be obtained, would you also recommend doing so?

Premier Zhou: This actual line of control exists not only in the eastern section, but also in the western section and in the middle section. For both parties, maintaining this actual line of control and stopping patrolling in all sections of the border can avoid border conflicts and facilitate negotiations. This is what we insist on.

Ruppert, journalist of the Czechoslovak Radio Station: The joint communique mentioned that both parties discussed the international situation. Can you tell us something about the talks in this regard, especially China's attitude towards the great powers conference?

Premier Zhou: The communique has already mentioned that we place our hopes on the upcoming great powers conference, hoping that it will help ease international tensions, ban nuclear weapons, and promote disarmament. As for the attitude of the Chinese government, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it fully supports the Soviet government's position on the issue of comprehensive disarmament, the Berlin issue, and some other issues.

Roy, journalist of the "Pakistan Times": Did you find Nehru this time the same as last time in 1956, or is there some difference?

Premier Zhou: Prime Minister Nehru and I personally expressed a common desire to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. Regarding the boundary issue, we each clarified our opinions and positions, and we talked more about this aspect.

MacFarquhar, journalist of the British "Daily Telegraph": When the Dalai Lama came to India, the Chinese government's statement said that he was forced to come to India under the coercion of his followers. Because of this idea, when you established the new Tibetan government, you reserved a seat for the Dalai. But in your answer just now, you said that the Dalai Lama and his followers are carrying out some activities against China, as if the Dalai is a free and independent person in India. Therefore, I want to ask: First, what made the Chinese government change its previous view? Second, what actions have you taken to tell the Chinese people that the Dalai Lama is carrying out activities against China in India? Third, is the position of leader of the Tibet Autonomous Region still reserved for the Dalai?

Premier Zhou: The three letters written by the Dalai to the Chinese authorities before leaving Lhasa proved that he was coerced by the people around him. The Dalai also acknowledged these three letters after arriving in India. The Chinese people have reserved some room for the Dalai, not only reserving his position as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, but also reserving his position as Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. However, the people around the Dalai have made the Dalai go further and further and dragged him to betray the motherland, trying to prevent him from returning to the embrace of the motherland. As for how much free will the Dalai has now, because I have not met him, I cannot answer this question.

Kulkarni, journalist of the Tamil Daily "Daily News": In addition to inviting Prime Minister Nehru, have you invited other ministers to visit China?

Premier Zhou: We expressed our invitation to other ministers of the Indian government to visit China when we met with them. Of course, a formal invitation still needs to be issued by the government.

Kulkarni: Have you invited all the ministers?

Premier Zhou: We did not invite all the ministers. If they are willing to visit China, we welcome them.

Malgani, journalist of "Organizer": What if the officials of both sides also fail to reach an agreement like the prime ministers of the two countries?

Premier Zhou: I don't want to have such a pessimistic thought. We have confidence in Sino-Indian friendship, and things will always develop in a favorable direction. Of course, this will take some time. If we did not have a sincere desire and confidence, we would not have come to Delhi. If necessary, for the friendship of the great Chinese and Indian peoples, I, or others, will come to Delhi again.

### 在离开印度前夕举行的记者招待会上  周恩来总理答记者问

专栏：

    在离开印度前夕举行的记者招待会上
    周恩来总理答记者问
    新华社新德里28日电　周恩来总理于4月25日晚十时半到26日晨一时在印度总统府举行了记者招待会。
    参加这个招待会的有一百五十多名印度和其他国家的记者。周总理首先发表了书面谈话（已见4月26日报），然后他说，他愿意回答记者所提出的任何问题，但是，他希望他们的报纸和通讯社全文发表。或者发表他们各自报刊所问答的全部内容。中国主要报纸也将全文发表，并将在英文的“北京周报”上发表，以便送他们每位一份。问答如下：
    日本新闻辛迪加印籍记者萨保华：阁下已经邀请尼赫鲁总理访问中国，尼赫鲁是否已经接受了邀请？
    周总理：尼赫鲁总理告诉我，他将根据双方官员进行工作的情况来考虑。
    印度报业托辣斯记者拉加凡：在印度，你给尼赫鲁总理的信已经都全文发表了，但是尼赫鲁总理给你的信，中国报纸却没有发表。讲到言论自由，你是不是准备让中国报纸全文发表这些信？
    周总理：这位先生可能没有读过中国报纸，中国报纸早就把尼赫鲁总理给我的信和我给尼赫鲁总理的信全文发表了。
    印度“政治家报”记者钱德拉：我想问一下，是什么阻碍你回到边界一两年以前的情况，因为行动是在一两年以前采取的。
    周总理：在中国这方面，这一两年同过去一样，中国政府从来没有采取行动改变边界现状。
    “印度教徒报”记者兰加斯华米：在谈判当中，两国总理认为哪一段分歧最大？
    希望印度政府对西段地区采取同中国政府在东段地区所采取的同样态度
    周总理：东段和西段都有争议。中段争议比较小。
    在东段，我们的地图所画的边界线在印度地图所画的边界线南边、在印度地图上划入印度的这块地区，是久经中国行政管辖的地区。印度在独立以后逐渐向前推进到它目前在地图上画出来的这条线。印度政府要求我们承认这条线；有时候，印度政府甚至公开说这是麦克马洪线。我们绝对不能承认这条线，因为这是英帝国主义在它同中国西藏地方当局的秘密换文中非法画出来的，中国历届政府从来没有承认这条线。虽然如此，我们愿意在中印边界问题解决前维持现状，不越过这条线，并且在谈判边界问题时，我们也不提出领土要求作为先决条件。由于我们采取这样一种谅解和让步的态度，所以东段边界的讨论就显得时间用的少。
    在西段，中国的地图关于边界线的画法和印度的地图是不一致的。历来中国地图关于这一段边界的画法虽然小有出入，但基本上是一致的。可是印度地图却变动了许多次。中国一直按照中国地图的界线实施行政管辖，即从喀喇昆仑山口，向东南大体沿着喀喇昆仑山脉的分水岭到空喀山口，再从空喀山口向南直到帕里河附近处，这一条线以北和以东的边界地区，历史上从来就属于中国管辖的。其中大部分，包括阿克赛钦地区，是中国新疆管辖的，小部分是属于西藏管辖的。这种历史上的行政管辖，我们有很多的历史文件和资料作为证明。新中国成立以后，一直就管辖这个地区。把它作为连接新疆南部和西藏阿里地区的主要交通要道。关于这个地区，印度地图的边界画法，在十九世纪中叶以前，是跟中国地图相接近的。1865年以后到1943年这个时期，印度主要的地图对这段边界的画法模模糊糊。1950年印度官方地图用颜色涂出印度现在主张的这段边界的轮廓，但仍然标明这个地方是未定界。最后，直到1954年正和东段边界一样才变为诸位现在在印度报纸上所看到的那个地图的正式画法。因此，就是从一百多年来印度自己的地图的演变，也完全可以证明这个地区的边界是没有划定的。我们要求印度政府对这个地区采取同中国政府在东段地区所采取的同样态度，即可以保留自己的立场，同意从事谈判，并且不越过中国地图上所标出的中国行政管辖线。印度政府对这个问题不完全同意。因此，存在着比较大的争议。两国总理在这方面讨论时间也特别用的多。
    在中段，也有争议，但那是属于个别地方的问题。
    “印度时报”记者维尔吉斯：中国对不丹有什么要求？
    周总理：很对不住，我们对不丹没有要求，也没有争议。你会记得，中国政府在给印度政府的信中，两次提到中国同锡金、不丹没有边界的争议，而且也很尊重印度和锡金、不丹的正当关系。
    “巴基斯坦时报”记者罗伊：尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊说中国要求珠穆朗玛峰，情况怎样？
    周总理：谢谢你提醒这个问题。明天我们就要到尼泊尔去了，我相信，我们会很友好地解决这个问题的。
    印度报业托辣斯记者特朗：我是说，中国认为这个山峰是中国的，是否是真的？
    周总理：事情的经过并不是同诸位所知道的那样。因为这是属于外交问题，我们两国总理会谈的详细内容我不打算在这里宣布。
    英国“每日邮报”记者阿特金森：你对你在德里的会谈，是否感到高兴？因为中国没有放弃一寸土地给印度。我愿意提醒阁下，印度在这次会谈的基础，就是要中国洗刷侵略。
    周总理：中国从来没有侵略任何国家的土地，而且在历史上一向被人侵略，现在中国还有土地被别人侵占，例如台湾。我很高兴，中印两国总理在会谈中完全同意双方不提领土要求作为谈判的先决条件。这证明会谈是在友好的基础上进行的。至于说到侵略别人的土地，这位先生代表英国报纸，当然会知道，英国到现在还占领着中国的什么地方。
    印地文“今天报”记者查图维迪：印度政府在提请中国政府注意中国地图的时候，中国政府曾经说这是国民党时代画的，没有经过有系统的仔细勘察，一旦仔细勘察以后，就要进行订正，这是否是真的？为什么你在跟尼赫鲁第一次会晤和第二次会晤的时候，都没有提出地图问题，而现在你却要根据中国历史坚持中国的要求，而要印度忘掉在英国时期发生的事情？
    在边界没有勘察和谈判划定以前，单方面地把自己的地图强加给另一方，是不友好、不对等的态度。
    周总理：中国的地图是根据历史延续下来的情况画的，这当中有些地方与实际管辖情况有出入，对于这一点我们历来就是这样说的。不仅跟印度有这样的情况，跟别的邻国也有这样的情况。反过来说，别的国家的地图同中国交界的地方也有这种情况。因此，我们才多次跟尼赫鲁总理说，中国地图在双方经过勘察，和划定边界以后，我们将根据双方的协议来修改各自的地图。关于这一点，先生可以从中缅边界协定中得到证明。这就是说，一旦我们签订中缅边界协定后，双方都要修改自己的地图。但是绝不能在没有勘察和谈判划定以前，单方面地把自己的地图强加给另一方，要对方按照自己的要求修改地图，这不是友好的态度，也不是对等的态度。因此，我们不能这样作。
    “联系”周刊记者贝迪：朗久情况如何？
    周总理：朗久是在所谓麦克马洪线以北，这是历史材料证明了的，但是印度政府却把朗久说成是在所谓麦克马洪线以南、在自己的管辖范围内。
    “印度斯坦时报”记者斯瓦鲁普：你跟印度领袖会谈，是否得到这样一个印象，在印度发生了很大变化，印度人民对中国人民的友好和信任正在变化，阁下是否采取了一些很激进的步骤来改变这种形势？
    中印两国十亿人民的团结，是任何反动力量也破坏不了的。
    周总理：我不是像你那样看的。我在书面谈话中已经说过，中印两国人民的友谊是永恒的，边界问题的争议是暂时的。在两国政府交涉解决的过程中，可能存在着一时的隔阂，但是，经过这次会谈，双方进一步增进了了解。我相信，这一时的乌云是会消除的，因为中印两国人民没有根本利益的冲突。我们不仅过去友好，而且会千年万年地友好下去。我愿意向在座的各位，特别是向广大的印度人民表示中国人民和中国政府，对于印度、和中国周围的任何其他国家都没有领土要求。我们绝不会侵略任何国家的一寸土地，当然我们也不容忍人家侵略我们。至于中印两国关系，我坚决相信边界的一时纠纷能够得到解决，两国人民会永远友好下去，印度绝大多数人民愿意对中国友好的观念也没有改变。不久前，在德里的中国农业展览得到广大印度人民的欣赏和重视，就说明了这一点，我愿意借此机会通过各位向广大的印度人民致谢。我和我的同事们自然可以在促进中印友好方面作一些工作，但是最重要的是两个伟大国家十亿人民的团结，这是任何反动力量也破坏不了的。
    北美新闻联盟和妇女新闻社女记者谢巴德：你可否考虑邀请艾森豪威尔总统访问北京，但并不因此约束美国要承认红色中国？
    周总理：你的好意却被你提出的条件打消了。因为既然美国不承认新中国，中国如何能够邀请美国的元首艾森豪威尔总统访问北京呢？
    又问：我的第二个问题是代表妇女新闻社提出的。你作为一个六十二岁的人看来气色异常好，你如何注意自己的健康？是否经常运动？或者有特别的饮食？
    周总理：谢谢你。我是一个东方人，我是按东方人的生活方式生活的。
    英国广播公司驻德里记者惠勒：在你同印度领袖的会谈中，他们是否提出了中国侵略了印度的问题？对这样一个基本分歧，两国在会谈中如何解决的？如果这个问题在两国总理会谈中没有解决，官员们会谈又如何能解决呢？
    周总理：这是西方帝国主义的想法。在这次会谈中，我们没有提出这样的问题。如果印度政府的首脑们提出这样的问题，不仅不合乎客观事实，而且是不友好的。我只能说，我们两个友好的国家不愿意在这一点上满足西方国家的希望。
    “阿萨姆论坛报”记者夏尔马：鉴于关于乌热这块小地方的谈判还拖了三年时间没有解决。两国政府是否给了他们的官员特别的指示，使将来的会谈加速进行？
    周总理：乌热问题尽管争议了很久，但是并没有引起冲突，而且总会解决的。关于两国官员会谈的职权范围，联合公报已予发表，当然为了便利他们的工作，两国政府还要进一步分别给他们以指示。公报已经表示了这样的愿望，希望两国官员的工作，有利于两国政府进一步考虑解决边界问题。
    “印度时报”记者英德捷特：你说一个国家不应把它的地图强加于另一个国家。为了保持你所说的永恒的友谊，你能否同意把拉达克地区中立化，就像尼赫鲁总理所建议的那样？
    周总理：在这次会谈中，尼赫鲁总理并没有坚持这样的要求。如果尼赫鲁总理提出要中国从阿克赛钦地区就是你所说的拉达克撤出，那么，中国政府也可以同样地提出要印度从东段地区就是在中国和印度地图在东段画法有很大出入的那个地区撤出来，这印度政府如何能够接受？当然中国政府并没有那样提出。
    “联系”周刊记者贝迪：可否认为，你的立场已经从开始谈判时有了改变？
    周总理：中国的立场就是友好地、公平合理地解决两国的边境争议，首先达成原则的协议。这个立场没有改变，至于具体问题这次会谈没有能够接触很多。
    印地文“新世界报”记者萨克森纳：除了边界问题外，两国总理曾否提出了一些埋怨的问题，如西藏问题，达赖喇嘛政治避难问题，遵守和平共处五项原则问题？印度人民和政府是否作了一些事冒犯了你们的感情？
    西藏永远是中国各民族大家庭中的一员，任何外国干涉中国内政的行为，都是注定要失败的。
    周总理：提到西藏问题，达赖主要是他的追随者为了维持在西藏的农奴制度而进行叛变，但失败了，他们逃到印度来。在印度，他们得到政治避难。这是国际上通常惯例，我们没有什么反对意见。但是他们到印度以后的活动超过了这个范围。印度政府曾多次对中国政府说，将不让达赖喇嘛和他的追随者在印度进行任何反对新中国的政治活动。但是达赖及其追随者在印度国内和国外进行的反对中国的活动，已有不少次。这是我们感到遗憾的。
    西藏是中国的一部分，这是印度政府所承认了的。我可以告诉这位先生，绝大多数西藏人民现在已经从农奴制度下得到解放，他们分得了土地，进行了民主改革。西藏经济将不断发展，人口也将会增加，它将永远成为中国各民族大家庭中的一员。任何外国干涉中国内政的行为，都是注定要失败的，这种行为本身就违背了中印两国所共同倡议的五项原则。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”记者弗里登贝格：在你今晚的书面谈话中谈到，双方在解决问题以前，可保持一条实际控制线。假如不能获得解决，你是否也会建议这样做？
    周总理：这条实际控制线，不仅存在于东段，而且存在于西段，存在于中段。对双方来讲，保持这条实际控制线，并且在边界各段都停止巡逻，就能够避免边境冲突，便利谈判的进行，这是我们所坚持的。
    捷克斯洛伐克广播电台记者鲁佩耳特：在联合公报中曾提到，双方讨论了国际形势。你可否告诉我们一些在这方面的会谈情况，特别是中国对于大国会议的态度？
    周总理：公报上已经提到我们对即将举行的大国会议寄以希望，希望它有助于缓和国际紧张局势，禁止核武器，促进裁军。至于中国政府的态度，中国政府多次声明完全支持苏联政府关于全面裁军问题、柏林问题和其他一些问题的主张。
    “巴基斯坦时报”记者罗伊：你这次来，发现尼赫鲁同上次1956年是否一样，还是有些不同？
    周总理：尼赫鲁总理和我个人都一样表示了维持中印友好的共同愿望。关于边界问题，我们各自阐明彼此的意见和立场，在这方面谈得多些。
    英国“每日电讯报”记者麦克法尔加：达赖喇嘛来到印度时，中国政府的声明说他是在他的随从者劫持下被迫来到印度的。由于这种想法，当你们成立新的西藏政府的时候，给达赖保留一席的位置，但在你刚才回答问题时，你说达赖喇嘛和他的追随者进行着某些反对中国的活动，好像达赖在印度是一个自由而独立的人，因此我要问：一、什么使中国政府改变了以前的看法？二、你们采取了什么行动来告诉中国人民达赖喇嘛在印度进行反对中国的活动？三、西藏自治区领袖的职位是否还给达赖保留着？
    周总理：达赖在离开拉萨以前，当时写给中国当局的三封信，证明他是被他周围的人劫持的。这三封信，达赖到印度后也承认了。中国人民对达赖是留有余地的，不仅给他保留着西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员的职位，并且还保留着他的全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长的职位。但达赖周围的人，却使达赖越走越远拖他背叛祖国，尽量阻挠他回到祖国的怀抱。至于现在达赖的自由意志究竟有多少，因为我没有见到他，我不能回答这个问题。
    泰米尔文日报“每日新闻报”记者库尔卡尼：你除邀请尼赫鲁总理外，曾否邀请其他部长访问中国？
    周总理：我们在同印度政府其他部长们见面时表示过邀请他们访问中国。当然，正式的邀请还有待于政府发出请帖。
    库尔卡尼：你是否邀请了所有部长？
    周总理：我们并没有邀请所有部长，如果他们愿意去访问中国，我们是欢迎的。
    “组织家报”记者马尔加尼：如果双方官员也像两国总理一样达不成协议，那将怎样？
    周总理：我不愿作这种悲观的想法。我们是抱有中印友好的信心的，事情总会向有利方向发展。当然这需要一些时间。如果我们没有真诚愿望和信心，我们不会到德里来。如果需要的话，为了伟大的中印两国人民的友好，我，或者其他人，还会再来德里的。
