Yuebei Village
	Dang Ziqiang

	In the mountains of northern Vietnam, there are many basins and plains of varying sizes. The Tien Phong Agricultural Production Cooperative, which we recently visited, is located in the center of such a basin plain.

	Leaving Thai Nguyen City, the capital of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, and heading northeast along the highway from Thai Nguyen to Lang Son, the car travels through heavy mountains and dense forests. The highway is like a yellow brocade ribbon, wrapped around the mountainside. The population here is sparse, and one rarely encounters many houses after driving for half a day. Occasionally, one meets a few pedestrians, mostly hunters with short knives at their waists and long guns on their shoulders. The car drove down a long slope, and before us was a small plain of about five square kilometers. This is a completely different scene. Rice fields connect to rice fields, and bananas are planted along both sides of the road. The mountain streams are diverted into irrigation channels, obediently passing through the fields. Fields, forests, everywhere there are traces of people's labor.

	Vietnamese friends led us into a village by the highway. Like many Vietnamese mountain villages, it has such harmonious poetry and picturesque beauty. Neatly trimmed bushes serve as fences for each household; each family's courtyard always has several tall, straight betel nut trees, topped with evergreen broad leaves extending in all directions, like a wonderful stroke in a painting. The houses are entirely built of bamboo and palm leaves, and the color of the bamboo walls shows that more than 80% of the houses are newly built. This is the Tien Phong Agricultural Cooperative.

	The director of the cooperative briefed us on the situation. He first talked about the dark and hopeless life the people here lived under colonial rule. Forty years ago, a French captain stationed nearby took a fancy to this fertile land and was determined to take it for himself. He occupied the village's water source and cut off the water flowing to the rice fields. Water is the lifeline of farmers; without water, there is nothing. The local farmers had no choice but to "sell" the land to the captain, and fifty hectares of farmland became the captain's private estate; the true owners of the land became slaves. The captain built a villa next to the bunker, greedily sucking the blood of the people. The highway was built, and the highway transported away the golden rice; the canals were dredged, and the canals floated away the bronze-colored timber. The fiery phoenix flowers bloomed and withered, and then bloomed again, and the farmers endured a bitter life for thirty years.

	In 1950, a thunderclap in spring, Chairman Ho's troops arrived, that was the famous "Border Campaign". The "Expeditionary Force" and the "Foreign Legion", together with the captain, were all swept away like garbage. The golden star red flag appeared on the top of the mountain, and Chairman Ho's troops took root here. For many years, the revolutionary seeds sown here by the Party have been burning fiercely. From then on, the people here entered their own century.

	The dark days of the past have vanished like nightmares. Life is full of glory. The Labor Party held high the guiding light, and the people carried out democratic reforms and land reforms according to the Party's instructions, and then embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. More than 90% of the 130 households in the village participated in the work exchange groups. In the spring of 1958, when the Party Committee of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region called on the people in the mountainous areas to organize cooperatives, they responded first and established the Tien Phong Agricultural Cooperative. Since the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, bumper harvests have been achieved year after year. Last year's late rice yield per hectare reached two and a half tons, more than 40% more than individual farmers. Members can get four kilograms of dried grain per labor day. Of course, this level is not the highest among the more than 28,000 agricultural cooperatives in the country, but it is not an easy task to achieve this level in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam. In the past, people here seemed accustomed to poor harvests, and a concept passed down from generation to generation was that in the high mountains and old forests, the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, and the rice yield will never catch up with the plains. In order to break this conservative thinking, the Party branch patiently did a lot of persuasion work, fertilizing, close planting, pest control...etc. Every step forward went through some complex and tortuous processes. Last year, when planting early rice, the county arranged for each agricultural cooperative to formulate a high-yield plan, and some members couldn't understand it. They believed that the quality of the harvest was entirely determined by natural conditions, and people could not predict it. The cooperative management committee raised the question of "Who did we farm for in the past and how did we farm? Who are we farming for now and how should we farm?" and organized members to discuss it using the method of recalling comparisons to inspire their conscious labor enthusiasm. At the same time, they used the experience of old cooperatives in the plains to explain the principle that "success depends on human effort, and people can conquer nature." Later facts proved that the formulated plan could not only be completed, but some teams even exceeded the plan. After last year's summer harvest, a few wealthy households in the cooperative made comments, saying that although grain production had increased, individuals could not freely engage in sideline businesses, and participating in the cooperative was not as good as working alone. The Party branch of the cooperative immediately seized on this topic and launched a debate on "two roads", thoroughly refuting the fallacy that "working alone can lead to wealth, and joining the cooperative is not free", greatly improving the awareness of the members and consolidating the cooperative ideologically. Last winter, the cooperative also reclaimed some wasteland to expand the early rice planting area this year. The cooperative cadres also planted two experimental fields, with the aim of creating a set of planting methods more suitable for local conditions, and striving for a comprehensive high yield this year.

	We visited the cooperative's irrigation channels. The water conservancy system here has fully met the needs of farmland, and in the future, we will further study the comprehensive utilization of water resources. In a large reservoir, many bamboo poles are soaked. It is said that fresh bamboo can be protected from insects after being soaked in water. The reservoir is connected to the main canal, and the bamboo can be used to make rafts after being soaked and floated to other places along the canal. The bamboo forests here are all wild, and farmers use their leisure time to go to the mountains to cut bamboo and collect other forest products, which can earn a considerable income. This is a kind of "sideline" of the cooperative.

	When we left Tien Phong Cooperative, we saw the place where the French captain built his villa, which was on a small hill in the center of the village. It was indeed a very suitable commanding height. Now, among the broken walls and ruins, many banana trees grow stubbornly, and their wide and long leaves sway in the wind, how free, beautiful and proud they appear!

    越北一村	党自强
    在越南北部山区的崇山峻岭之间，散布着许多大小不等的盆地平原。最近我们访问的先锋农业生产合作社，就在这类盆地平原的中央。
    离开越北自治区首府太原市，沿着从太原到谅山的公路向东北行，汽车一直穿行在重山密林之中。公路像一条黄色锦带，缠绕在山峦半腰。这里人烟稀少，车行半天也碰不到几户人家。偶尔遇见几个行人，大半都是腰挎短刀，肩负长筒枪的猎人。汽车驶下一个长长的斜坡，展现在我们眼前的是一个约五平方公里的小平原。这里完全是另外一番景致。稻田连接着稻田，公路两旁种满香蕉。深山中的流水被引进灌溉渠道，驯顺地穿过田畦。田野，树林，到处留下人们劳动的痕迹。
    越南朋友领我们进入公路旁的一个村落。像许多越南的山村一样，它具有那么和谐的诗情画意。一道道略加修剪的灌木丛，是家家户户的围墙；每户人家庭院里总有几株高矗直立的槟榔树，它顶着向四面伸展的常绿阔叶，宛似画中妙笔。房子完全是用竹子和葵叶盖的，从竹墙的颜色上可以看出，80％以上的房子是新建的。这里就是先锋农业社。
    社主任向我们介绍情况。他首先谈到殖民统治时代这里人民所过的暗无天日的生活。四十年前，一个驻扎在附近的法国大尉，看中了这块肥沃的土地，一心想据为己有，他就占领了这个村的水源，截断流往稻田的水。水是农民的命根子，没有水就没有一切。当地农民只好把土地“卖”给大尉，于是连绵五十公顷的耕地，变成大尉的私人庄园；土地的真正主人，变成了奴隶。大尉在碉堡旁边修起了别墅，贪婪地吮吸着人民的血膏。公路修通了，公路运走金黄的稻谷；水渠疏浚了，水渠飘走古铜色的木材。火红的凤凰花开了又谢，谢了再开，农民苦涩的日子足足熬过三十个年头。
    1950年，一声春雷，胡主席的队伍打来了，那就是著名的“边界战役”。什么“远征军”、“外籍兵团”，连同大尉在内，统统像垃圾一样被扫走了。山顶上出现了金星红旗，胡主席的队伍在这里扎下了根。多少年来，党在这里播下的革命火种，熊熊地燃烧起来。从那时起，这里的人民进入自己的世纪。
    过去的黑暗日子像噩梦一样消逝了。生活充满着光辉。劳动党高举着指路明灯，人民按照党的指示进行了民主改革和土地改革，随后又走上互助合作的道路。全村一百三十户人家，90％以上都参加了变工组。1958年春，越北自治区党委号召山区人民组织合作社时，这里首先响应，成立了先锋农业合作社。自从农业社成立以后，连年都获得丰收。去年的晚稻每公顷的单位面积产量达两吨半，比单干户多了40％以上。社员每个劳动日可得四公斤干谷。当然，这个水平在全国两万八千多个农业社中并不是最高的，但在越北山区争取到这个水平却不是一件容易事。过去，这里的人们似乎习惯了歉收，世世代代流传下来的一种观念，认为高山老林，天寒地冻，水稻产量永远赶不上平原。为了打破这种保守思想，党支部耐心地作了许多说服工作，施肥、密植、除虫害……等等，每前进一步，都经过一些复杂曲折的过程。去年种植早稻时，县里布置各农业社拟定丰产计划，一部分社员就想不通，他们认为收成好坏，完全决定于自然条件，人是不可能预知的。社管理委员会提出了“以前是为谁种地，怎样种地？现在是为谁种地，应该怎样种？”的问题，组织社员用回忆对比的方法进行讨论，启发社员们自觉的劳动热情。同时，又用平原地区老社的经验，说明“事在人为，人能胜天”的道理。后来的事实证明，拟订的计划不仅能够完成，而且有的队还超过了计划。去年夏收以后，社内少数富裕户发出议论，说粮食虽然增产了，但个人不能自由经营副业，参加合作社不如单干好。社党支部立即抓住这个题目，开展了“两条道路”的辩论，彻底批驳了“单干可以致富，入社不自由”的谬论，大大提高了社员的觉悟，从思想上巩固了社。去年冬季，社里又开垦了一部分荒地，扩大今年早稻种植面积。社干部还种了两块试验田，目的是创造一套更适合于当地情况的种植方法，争取今年全面高产。
    我们参观了这个社的灌溉渠道。这里的水利系统，已完全满足了农田的需要，今后还要进一步研究水利资源的全面综合利用问题。在一个较大的蓄水池里，泡着许多竹竿。据说鲜竹经过浸水可免虫蛀。蓄水池与渠道主干相通，竹子泡过以后即可编筏，顺着渠道流放到外地。这里的竹林全是野生的，农民利用农闲时间，上山砍伐竹子，顺便采集些其他森林土产，可以得到一笔不小的收入。这是合作社的一种“副业”。
    当我们离开先锋社的时候，看到了当年法国大尉修建别墅的地方，那是在全村中央的一个小山丘上，的确是一个很适宜的制高点。现在，在断墙残壁之间，许多芭蕉树倔强地生长着，它那又宽又长的叶子，临风摇曳，显得多么自由自在，多么美丽和骄傲！
