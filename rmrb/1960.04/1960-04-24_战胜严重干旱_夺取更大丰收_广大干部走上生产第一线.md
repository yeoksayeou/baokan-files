Overcoming Severe Drought and Seizing Greater Harvests
Large Numbers of Cadres Go to the Production Front Lines

    This newspaper reports that cadres at all levels in Yunnan Province are taking up production tools and work point record books and heading to the front lines of production amidst the intense drought resistance and spring plowing efforts. Cadres at all levels converge in the fields, with cadres and the masses united as one, sharing weal and woe, pushing the spring plowing production movement centered on drought resistance to a new high tide.

    Now, the time for the large-scale planting climax in Yunnan is not far off. The agricultural front is entering a critical moment to strive for a bumper harvest this year. However, the entire province has not had a thorough rain for more than 170 days from November of last year to the present. According to weather forecasts, the drought will continue to develop for more than a month to come. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed past experiences and the objective situation this year and decided to mobilize all forces to use the favorable conditions of high temperatures brought about by the drought to overcome the unfavorable conditions brought about by the severe drought, overcome difficulties, and seize a bumper harvest. In order to ensure that a major drought year is turned into a year of plenty, the Provincial Party Committee also decided to expand the original plan of 10 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields to 20 million mu, and to make planting these high-yield fields well as the decisive battle for winning a bumper harvest this year. Through this battle, they will strive to seize more than 70% of the annual grain plan under the condition of half a year without rain. This plan greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the people of the entire province. Under the heroic slogans of "The more drought, the more we want a bumper harvest" and "Bumper harvest depends on people, not heaven," the broad masses immediately launched a large-scale spring plowing production upsurge centered on drought resistance.

    In this severe struggle of "Man will conquer nature," Party committees at all levels, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, attached great importance to improving their leadership style and improving their leadership methods, so as to unite the entire party and the entire people into one heart, one mind, and seize a bumper harvest with one heart and one mind. After the three-level cadre meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, various places sent a large number of cadres directly to the grassroots level to lead production on the production front. Under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, going deep into reality and deep into the masses has become a common action throughout the province. From the beginning of March to the beginning of April, more than 70,000 cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels took up production tools and work point record books and went to the front lines of production. These cadres, together with more than 50,000 basic-level cadres from the management districts throughout the province, went deep into the production teams. They stayed in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and ate in the public canteens with the commune members, working alongside the masses while using typical examples to guide the overall situation. At present, in most counties in the province, more than 70% of the county-level organs have directly gone to the grassroots level. In some remote ethnic minority areas, it is also around 50% to 60%. The county party organs of the eight counties in Yuxi Prefecture have all moved to the countryside to work; in Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, more than 4,700 of the 5,000 cadres in the entire prefecture have gone to the grassroots level. Among the more than 7,000 cadres in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture who have gone to the production front, many are carrying sickles, hoes, manure baskets, manure buckets, and work point record books, ensuring that wherever they go, they participate in production. After going deep into the grassroots level, cadres at all levels also combined with veteran farmers and technical personnel to conduct demonstration plots, create experience, and guide the overall situation. In Daguan County, from leading cadres of the county party committee to production team leaders, the demonstration plots directly managed by cadres at all levels totaled more than 80,000 mu. These demonstration plots played a guiding role in adhering to various technical measures, and many cadres also created new production experience through the demonstration plots. A large number of cadres went directly to the grassroots level to eat, live, and work with the masses, which greatly encouraged the confidence of the broad masses of commune members in overcoming drought and seizing a bumper harvest. Wherever the cadres went, there was a greater upsurge in production, and the labor attendance rate there was greatly improved. At present, the labor attendance rate in rural areas throughout the province has exceeded 95%, and many communes have achieved full attendance. The broad masses praised the cadres for going deep and "three togethers" with the masses, which is "adding fuel to the fire and adding strength to the strength" to the spring plowing production upsurge centered on drought resistance.

    This year, the characteristics of cadres at all levels in Yunnan Province going deep into the grassroots level are: not only is the work style arduous and in-depth, achieving "three togethers" with the masses; but also the thinking is more arduous and in-depth, able to conduct investigation and research purposefully to guide work; not only able to go deep into key points, but also obtain experience through going deep into key points to command the overall situation; not only go deep to solve production problems, but also go deep to solve the livelihood problems of the masses. For backward areas and backward units, instead of "taking a fleeting glance," they implement contracted responsibility and long-term fixed-point participation in labor, contracting to help change the backward situation. The first secretary of the Chuxiong County Party Committee went deep into the Xulan Ying group of the Xiabaimiao Production Team of the Xiabaimiao Commune. Through working together with the masses, they conducted in-depth and meticulous research from all aspects of ideology, production, and life, discussed with the masses, and put forward practical solutions, which made the labor attendance rate of this small team rise from 74% to full attendance, and the work efficiency increased by 1.8 times, all in compliance with quality standards. Experience was gained in completing the deep plowing task quickly, well, and economically by a small team. Subsequently, the County Party Committee, based on this experience, proposed ten measures to complete the deep plowing task within 20 days and promoted them throughout the county. Therefore, the county has now completed the plan of 75,000 mu of deeply plowed land, and more than 60% has been plowed twice. In order to gain experience in drought resistance, the first secretary of the Yongsheng County Party Committee went deep into the Jinguang Commune, which was the most severely affected by drought, and led the masses to climb cliffs and precipices to survey the terrain. Finally, they discovered a ditch line that could bypass the cliffs and precipices, making a large ditch that was originally thought to be unable to benefit this year completed in ten days. The commune members gratefully sang: "The county party secretary came to help, clear water flowed down to the fields, if you ask how big this water is? It can irrigate 13,000 mu of dry land." Led by the county party secretary, Yuxi County cadres at all levels set up more than 150 "experimental fields" in canteens throughout the county. The county party secretary went deep into a backward canteen to conduct in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, helping the canteen solve problems such as planned grain use, vegetable self-sufficiency, and planned management. In less than half a month, they cultivated a model canteen from backward to advanced, and promoted this experience throughout the county, making all 70 backward canteens in the county change their appearance, and more than 1,100 canteens also had significant improvements.

    The vigorous improvement of leadership style and going deep into the grassroots level by leaders at all levels has caused profound changes in the mental outlook of the broad masses of cadres and people. At present, while vigorously transforming backward areas and backward units, Yunnan's countryside has also entered a new stage of breaking through the intermediate state, overcoming the middle-stream thinking, and pushing the entire spring plowing production movement to a higher standard. Striving for the upstream and striving for greater achievements, this idea has become a topic of discussion among rural cadres. Under the influence of the vigorous, vigorous, down-to-earth, and arduous and in-depth style of the broad masses of cadres, the production upsurge centered on drought resistance in the province is rising one wave higher than another. At present, each prefecture has built tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of small-scale water conservancy projects in the drought resistance struggle. According to incomplete statistics: more than 1.8 million mu of farmland throughout the province has solved the problem of water for planting and sowing. Qujing Prefecture, which is severely affected by drought, also gave a general irrigation to more than 1.5 million mu of small spring crops. The various crops sown for drought resistance throughout the province have now reached more than 18 million mu, and the sowing progress of many crops is one to several times faster than last year; in terms of fertilizer accumulation, deep plowing, and small spring harvesting, they are also grasped earlier, faster, and with better quality than last year. The public canteens of the people's communes throughout the province have generally improved. Now, the canteens that are doing well account for more than 72% of the total number of canteens in the province. As the change of cadre style continues to deepen at the lower levels, the spring plowing production movement centered on drought resistance in the province is now developing rapidly in a more in-depth, meticulous, specific, and down-to-earth direction.

    战胜严重干旱　夺取更大丰收
    广大干部走上生产第一线
    本报讯　云南省各级干部在紧张的抗旱和春耕生产中，纷纷拿上生产工具和工分手册走上生产第一线。各级干部会师田间，干部群众上下一心，同甘共苦，已经把以抗旱为中心的春耕生产运动推向新的高潮。
    现在，云南距离大面积栽插高潮已经为时不远。农业战线正进入争取今年大丰收的关键时刻。但是，全省从去年11月到目前为止，已经一百七十多天没下透雨，据气象预报，今后一个多月中旱象仍将继续发展。中共云南省委讨论了历年经验和今年的客观形势，决定调动一切力量，利用干旱带来高气温的有利条件，克服严重干旱带来的不利条件，战胜困难，夺取大丰收。为了确保把大旱年变成丰年，省委还决定将原来计划的一千万亩大面积高产田扩大为两千万亩，并以种好这些高产田作为争取今年大丰收的决定性战役，通过这一战役，争取在半年无雨的条件下夺取占全年计划70％以上的粮食。这个计划大大鼓舞了全省群众的革命干劲，广大群众在“越旱越要丰收”、“丰收由人不由天”的英雄口号下，立即掀起一个大规模的以抗旱为中心的春耕生产高潮。
    在这场“人定胜天”的严重斗争中，各级党委根据省委指示，都十分重视改进领导作风、提高领导方法，以便把全党全民团结成一条心、一股劲、同心同德夺取丰收。省委三级干部会议后，各地都派出大批干部直接深入基层，到生产前线去领导生产。在省委的号召下，深入实际、深入群众，已经在全省成了普遍的行动，从3月初到4月初，省、地、县和公社四级干部，就有七万多人拿上生产工具和工分手册走上生产的第一线。这些干部会同全省五万多管理区基层干部深入生产队，他们在贫农、下中农家里住宿，到公共食堂里同社员们同锅吃饭，一面与群众并肩劳动，一面通过典型指挥全面。现在，全省大部分县级机关直接深入基层的人数都在70％以上，一部分边远民族地区，也都在50％到60％左右。玉溪专区八个县的县委机关，已经全部迁入农村办公；文山僮族苗族自治州全州五千多名干部，已经深入基层的有四千七百多人。楚雄彝族自治州走上生产前线的七千多干部中，许多人都拿着镰刀、锄头、粪箕、粪桶和工分手册，做到了人到那里，就到那里参加生产。各级干部在深入基层以后，还与老农、技术人员三结合，大搞指挥田，创造经验指导全面。大关县从县委领导干部到生产队长，各级干部直接经营的指挥田，共达八万多亩，这些指挥田在坚持各项技术措施中都发挥了指导作用，许多干部还通过指挥田创造了新的生产经验。大批干部直接深入基层与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，更加鼓舞了广大社员战胜干旱夺取丰收的信心。干部到那里，那里就出现更大的生产高潮，干部到那里，那里的劳动出勤率就大大提高。现在，全省农村劳动出勤率已经超过95％，许多公社达到全勤出工。广大群众称赞干部深入与群众“三同”，是给以抗旱为中心的春耕生产高潮“火上加油、劲上加劲”。
    今年云南省各级干部深入基层的特点是：不仅作风艰苦深入，做到与群众“三同”；而且思想也更加艰苦深入，能够有目的地进行调查研究指导工作；不仅能够深入重点，而且通过深入重点取得经验指挥全局；不仅深入解决生产问题，而且深入解决群众的生活问题。对于落后地区和落后单位，不是“走马观花”，而是实行分片包干、长期定点参加劳动，包干帮助改变落后面貌。中共楚雄县委第一书记深入下白庙公社下白庙生产队徐兰英小组，通过与群众共同劳动，从思想、生产、生活等各方面深入细致地研究，同群众一起商量，提出了切实可行的解决办法，使这个小队的劳动出勤率由74％上升到全勤出工，工效提高了一点八倍，全部合乎质量标准。取得了一个小队多快好省地完成深翻任务的经验。接着，县委根据这个经验提出了在二十天内完成深翻任务的十项措施在全县推广。因此，目前全县已经完成了七万五千亩深翻土地的计划，并有60％以上翻了两道。中共永胜县委第一书记为了取得抗旱经验，深入干旱最严重的金官公社，带领群众攀登悬崖绝壁，勘察地形，终于发现了一条可以绕过悬崖绝壁的水沟线路，使原来认为不能当年受益的一条大沟，十天就修通了，社员们感激的唱道：“县委书记来帮助，清水滚滚流下田，要问这水有多大？能灌干田一万三。”玉溪县由县委书记带头，各级干部在全县办起了一百五十多个食堂“试验田”，县委书记深入到一个落后食堂进行了深入细致的调查研究，帮助这个食堂解决了计划用粮、蔬菜自给和计划管理等问题，不到半月就培养了一个由落后变先进的标兵食堂，并将这一经验在全县推广，使全县七十多个落后食堂全部改变了面貌，一千一百多个食堂也都有了显著改进。
    各级领导大力改进领导作风、深入基层以后，已经引起了广大干部群众精神面貌的深刻变化。目前，云南农村在大力改造落后地区、落后单位的同时，又进入了一个突破中间状态、克服中游思想，把整个春耕生产运动推向更高的标准的新阶段。力争上游、争取更大成绩，这个思想已经在农村干部中成了人人议论的问题。在广大干部雷厉风行、生龙活虎、踏踏实实、艰苦深入的作风影响下，全省农村以抗旱为中心的生产高潮，正一浪高过一浪。目前，各专区在抗旱斗争中，都已经修起了几万件到十几万件小型水利工程，据不完全统计：全省已经有一百八十多万亩田地解决了栽插、播种用水问题。干旱严重的曲靖专区，还给一百五十多万亩小春作物普遍润了一次水。全省抗旱播种的各种作物，现在已达一千八百多万亩，许多作物的播种进度都比去年快一倍到数倍；在积肥、深翻、小春收割等方面，也都比去年抓得早、进度快、质量好。全省人民公社的公共食堂普遍有了提高，现在办得较好的食堂，已占全省食堂总数的72％以上。随着干部作风的改变不断深入下层，全省以抗旱为中心的春耕生产运动，现在正向着更加深入、细致、具体、踏实的方向迅速发展。（附图片）
