Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: Washington dispatch: The US ruling clique is becoming increasingly rampant, intensifying its political and military measures in an attempt to suppress the just struggle of the South Korean people and maintain its colonial rule in South Korea.

It is reported that the US State Department convened a meeting on the 26th with representatives of fourteen of the sixteen countries that participated in the Korean War of aggression to discuss the situation in South Korea. Representatives from Ethiopia and the Federation of South Africa did not attend the meeting. According to a statement issued after the meeting, Parsons, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, reported on the situation in South Korea. The statement did not elaborate on the discussions and results of the meeting, but it said that the participants hoped that "the situation will be resolved as soon as possible in a way that ensures the orderly operation of the democratic government of Korea (referring to the Syngman Rhee puppet regime - editor)."

According to US State Department spokesman White's response to reporters before the meeting, the meeting would discuss not only the "political aspects" of the South Korean situation, but also "undoubtedly discuss the military situation."

White said that in order to prevent possible "aggression," the US military command in Korea was "on 24-hour alert day and night in Korea."

In this conversation, White said that the United States was "closely watching developments." He expressed the hope that the United States would take "appropriate measures" to "eliminate popular discontent," while saying that the US troops stationed in South Korea "have a responsibility" to "prevent unrest from turning into bloodshed."

    叫嚷美国侵略军“有责任”采取行动
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团正在变本加厉，加紧采取政治的和军事的各种措施，力图镇压南朝鲜人民的正义斗争，维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治地位。
    据报道，美国国务院在26日召集参加侵略朝鲜战争的十六个国家中的十四个国家的代表开会，讨论南朝鲜的局势。埃塞俄比亚和南非联邦的代表没有参加会议。据会后发表的公报说，美国国务院远东事务助理国务卿帕森斯在会上就南朝鲜局势作了报告。公报没有详细谈到会议讨论的经过和结果，但是它说，参加会议的人希望“局势将以能够保证韩国民主政府（指李承晚傀儡政权——编者）有条不紊地进行工作的办法及早解决”。
    据美国国务院发言人怀特在会前回答新闻记者的问题时说，这次会议不仅要讨论南朝鲜局势的“政治方面”，“毫无疑问还会讨论军事情况”。
    怀特说，为了防止可能发生的“侵略”，侵朝美军司令部“正在朝鲜昼夜二十四小时戒备着”。
    怀特在这个谈话中说，美国正在“密切注意事态的发展”。他表示美国希望采取“适当措施”来“消除人民的不满”，同时他说，美国驻南朝鲜的军队“有责任”来“防止不安演变为流血事件”。
