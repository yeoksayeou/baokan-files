Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: Hebei Province had afforested more than 14 million mu and planted 692 million trees around houses and villages before the Qingming Festival, exceeding the spring afforestation task by 1.4%; Shijiazhuang Prefecture and Zunhua, Anguo and other eight counties (districts), which progressed faster, have completed the annual afforestation plan ahead of schedule.

Unified leadership, comprehensive planning, and the establishment of forestry bases are characteristics of this year's afforestation movement in Hebei Province. Since last winter, people's communes throughout the province have planned more than 2,100 forestry bases, mainly for timber forests, mine pillar forests, and woody oil forests, covering an area of more than 22.2 million mu. Now, more than 1,370 forestry bases have been built or are under construction throughout the province, covering an area of more than 8.46 million mu. During the same period, more than 3,800 community (team) run forest farms were also established throughout the province.

While vigorously developing timber forest bases, all localities have also prominently focused on afforestation and greening work in the upper reaches of the Yongding River and other rivers, and major reservoirs. Many areas have met the requirement that afforestation and greening work should follow wherever water conservancy projects go. According to incomplete statistics, the province has built 2.5 million mu of various protective forests.

In afforestation, all localities have carried out tree planting competitions centered on building "high-yield forestry demonstration plots." Whether in mountainous areas or plains, many "high-standard, high-quality" high-yield forests have been built. According to incomplete statistics, vast mountainous areas, accounting for more than half of the province's area, have built more than 7,000 high-yield mountains and more than 5,000 high-yield plains.

In the afforestation movement, all localities have also vigorously carried out cooperation to accelerate the speed of afforestation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 7th: The people of all ethnic groups, including the Hui and Han in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, while ensuring a comprehensive leap forward in various agricultural productions, have launched a vigorous and down-to-earth spring afforestation movement. According to incomplete statistics at the end of March, the region had afforested more than 650,000 mu, accounting for more than 65% of the annual afforestation plan.

Due to the full play given to the superiority of the people's communes with their large population and strong momentum, the tree planting work in various places this spring has been carried out quickly and well. At the beginning of the afforestation movement, the afforestation army composed of thousands of people in various places attacked barren mountains and ridges, hills and gullies, and roads and riverbanks with thunderous force. More than half of the communes in Guyuan County organized large-scale battles, and all of them overfulfilled this year's afforestation task by more than double within seven days.

This year, the region's forestry construction has entered a new stage. Comprehensive planning and the conscientious implementation of the "three-ization" policy of forestry base-ization, forest farm-ization, and high-yield-ization are the biggest characteristics of this spring's tree planting movement. The Guanshan and Liupanshan areas in the southern alpine and humid mountainous areas of the autonomous region and the banks of the Yellow River tributaries Jing River, Hulu River, and Qingshui River are key timber forest bases, combined with the construction of economic forests. The hilly and gully arid areas in the south are mainly used to build soil and water conservation forests. In the Yellow River plain area, afforestation is carried out with a combination of sand prevention forests, windbreak forests, bank protection forests, and timber forests, combined with the construction of economic forests.

In order to realize the forest farm-ization of forestry management, all localities have vigorously developed new farms while consolidating and consolidating the original forest farms. In the current afforestation movement, 64 new community-run forest farms and 364 team-run forest farms have been newly built throughout the region. In order to ensure good planting quality and high survival rate, technicians have been widely trained in various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th: Northern and southern Tianshan in Xinjiang have thawed, and fruit farmers of all ethnic groups in the region are vigorously cultivating fruit trees and actively developing horticulture. Kashi, Aksu, Korla, and Toksun in the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains, where the thawing was earlier, have established four large-scale state-owned horticultural farms this year; in addition to consolidating and transforming old orchards, many people's communes in Toksun, Makit and other counties are establishing a large number of community-run and team-run forest farms. The work of establishing new orchards by fruit farmers of all ethnic groups in the area of more than 1,000 kilometers along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains is also about to begin.

This year, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region plans to develop more than 300,000 mu of new orchards. In addition to continuing to promote many local varieties of fruit trees such as grapes, apples, pears, and apricots, various places have also introduced many high-quality fruit seedlings and more than 2.6 million scions from Liaoning, Henan, Gansu, Shandong and other places. In addition, more than 20,000 jin of various fruit tree seeds have also been purchased.

Xinjiang has favorable conditions for developing fruit production due to its dry climate, long sunshine hours, and large temperature differences. With the exception of a few ethnic minorities engaged in animal husbandry production, all ethnic groups have traditionally had the habit of planting fruit trees. In recent years, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, fruit and wood production in various places has developed greatly.

    河北宁夏积极建立林业基地
    天山南北果农大力栽培苹果葡萄
    据新华社天津7日电　河北省到清明节前已造林一千四百多万亩，四旁植树六亿九千二百万株，超额1.4％完成了春季造林任务；进度较快的石家庄专区和遵化、安国等八个县（区）都已提前超额完成了全年造林计划。
    统一领导，全面规划，建立林业基地，是今年河北省造林运动的一个特点。自去冬以来，全省各地人民公社就规划了以用材林、矿柱林和木本油料林为主的二千一百多个林业基地，面积达二千二百多万亩。现在，全省已经建成或正在建设的林业基地已达到一千三百七十多个，面积达八百四十六万多亩。在这同一时期，全省各地还建立了三千八百多个社（队）办林场。
    在大搞用材林基地的同时，各地还突出地抓住永定河和其他河流上游、各大水库造林绿化工作，很多地区作到了水利工程到那里造林绿化工作就跟到那里的要求。据不完全统计，全省已营造各种防护林二百五十万亩。
    各地在造林中，都开展了以大造“林业丰产方”为中心的植树造林竞赛。不论山区平原，到处营造了许多“高标准、高质量”的丰产林。据不完全统计，占全省面积二分之一以上的广大山区，已经建起七千多个丰产山和五千多个丰产川。
    在造林运动中，各地还大力开展协作，加快了造林速度。
    据新华社银川7日电　宁夏回族自治区回汉族人民，在保证各项农业生产全面跃进的同时，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈踏踏实实的春季造林运动。据3月底的不完全统计，全区已造林六十五万多亩，占全年造林计划的65％以上。
    由于充分发挥了人民公社人多势大的优越性，今春各地的植树造林工作搞得又快又好。造林运动一开始，各地千万人组成的造林大军，便以雷霆万钧之势，向荒山秃岭、丘陵沟壑、公路河岸猛攻。固原县有一半以上的公社，组织大兵团作战，七天之内，都超额一倍以上完成了今年造林任务。
    今年全区的林业建设已经进入了一个新的阶段。全面规划，认真贯彻执行林业基地化、林场化和丰产化的“三化”方针，是今年春季植树造林运动的最大特点。自治区南部的高寒阴湿山区的关山、六盘山地区和黄河支流泾河、葫芦河、清水河等河床两岸，是重点用材林基地，结合营造经济林。南部的丘陵沟壑干旱区，以营造水土保持林为主。黄河平原地区，以营造防沙林、防风林、护岸林、用材林并举，结合营造经济林。
    为了实现林业经营林场化，各地在整顿和巩固原有林场的同时，还大力发展新场。在当前的造林运动中，全区已新建社办林场六十四处，队办林场三百六十四处。为了确保植树质量好，成活率高，各地都普遍训练了技术员。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐7日电　新疆天山南北已经解冻，全区各族果农正大力栽培果树，积极发展园艺事业。解冻较早的天山南部喀什、阿克苏、库尔勒和托克逊等地，今年已分别建立了四个规模较大的国营园艺场；托克逊、麦盖提等县许多人民公社除已整顿改造了旧果园外，正在建立大批社办和队办园林场。天山北部沿兰新铁路线一千多公里地区，各族果农建立新果园的工作也即将开始。
    今年，新疆维吾尔自治区计划发展新果园三十多万亩。各地除继续推广本地葡萄、苹果、梨、杏等许多良种果树外，还从辽宁、河南、甘肃、山东等地引进了许多品质优良的果苗和二百六十多万条接穗，另外，还购进了各种果树籽种两万多斤。
    新疆气候干燥、日照长、温差大，具有发展水果生产的有利条件。除部分经营畜牧业生产的少数民族外，各民族历来就有种植果树的习惯，近几年来，在各级党委的领导下，各地的果木生产都有很大发展。
