The First Stamp Featuring Lenin's Portrait

When was the first stamp featuring Lenin's portrait issued?

Even during Lenin's lifetime, a leading comrade of the Soviet postal authorities solicited sketches for this stamp from several artists, and the printing plant was even prepared to print it. However, Lenin became very angry when he found out and ordered the prepared plate to be destroyed to avoid leaving any trace. Indeed, no trace of it remained.

As early as 1924, the "New York Times" correspondent in Moscow explained in a telegram to the United States why the Soviet Union had not issued any stamps featuring Lenin's portrait during Lenin's lifetime.

The first stamp featuring Lenin's portrait was published the day after Lenin's death, but it was already framed with a black border of mourning.

However, a stamp featuring Lenin's portrait had appeared before this.

Its history is as follows:

Soviet Russian stamps are enviable works of art among collectibles. Even within the country, they are extremely rare. As for abroad, it is even more difficult to find them. Suddenly, Soviet stamps were for sale in Italy, at the address: "Venice Italian Philatelic Association."

The most popular was the set of stamps featuring Lenin's portrait. Lenin and Soviet Russia were one and the same to the people. Not only philatelists bought these stamps, because many people wanted to have a picture of Lenin.

But how did Soviet stamps get to Italy? Especially the stamp featuring Lenin's portrait. Didn't Lenin prohibit the issuance of such stamps?

It turned out that these Soviet stamps were printed in Italy by a man named Marco Fondano.

    第一张绘有列宁肖像的邮票
    第一张绘有列宁肖像的邮票是什么时候发行的呢？
    还在列宁生前，苏联邮政主管部门的一位领导同志就向几位艺术家征求了这张邮票的草图，并且在印刷厂都准备好要印刷了。可是，列宁知道之后非常生气，命令把制好的版毁掉，以免留下什么痕迹。的确，它的痕迹不曾留下。
    还在1924年，“纽约时报”驻莫斯科记者就在拍往美国的电报中说明为什么在列宁生前，苏联没有发行任何一张绘有列宁肖像的邮票。
    第一张绘有列宁肖像的邮票是在列宁逝世的第二天出版的，但已经框上志哀的黑边了。
    但是，在这以前也曾出现了一种绘有列宁肖像的邮票。
    它的历史是这样的。
    苏维埃俄国的邮票是收藏物中令人羡慕的艺术品。即使在国内也是极为少见的。至于出国，就更加困难了。突然，在意大利有苏联邮票出售，出售的地址是：“威尼斯意大利集邮协会”。
    最受人欢迎的是绘有列宁肖像的那一组邮票。列宁和苏维埃俄国，对人们来说乃是一个整体。买这种邮票的不只是一些集邮家，因为许多人都想有一张列宁的像片。
    可是，苏联邮票究竟是怎么到意大利来的呢？尤其是绘有列宁肖像的这种邮票。列宁不是禁止发行这种邮票吗？
    原来这些苏联邮票是由一个叫马尔柯·冯达诺的人在意大利印制的。
