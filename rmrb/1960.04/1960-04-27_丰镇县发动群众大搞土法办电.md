Fengzhen County, Inner Mongolia, has achieved great success in mobilizing people of all ethnic groups to develop electricity using indigenous methods and relying on the power of the people's communes. By the end of March, the county had built twelve small hydroelectric power stations and six thermal power stations, with a total installed capacity of 326.5 kilowatts. Twelve more hydroelectric and thermal power stations are under construction throughout the county.

According to the plan, this county will build 171 hydro, thermal, and wind power stations this year, with a total installed capacity of 1,132 kilowatts. After these small power stations are completed, more than half of the farmers in the county will be able to install electric lights, 60% of the industries will be able to use electricity as power, and communes with suitable conditions will use electric plows, electric harvesters, and electric threshers for production.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical personnel, each power station first selects young people with a junior high school education or higher and good ideology to study at the already-built power stations before construction begins.

The problem of insufficient equipment is also solved through self-reliance as the mainstay, supplemented by external assistance, making use of whatever is available, using indigenous methods, and utilizing local materials.

    丰镇县发动群众大搞土法办电
    内蒙古丰镇县各族人民发挥人民公社威力，土法上马，全民办电获得巨大成绩。到3月末，全县已经建成小型水电站十二座，火力发电站六座，发电设备容量共计达到三百二十六点五瓩。全县还有十二处水力和火力发电站正在施工。
    按照规划，这个县今年将建成一百七十一座水、火、风力发电站，设备容量共达一千一百三十二瓩。这些小型发电站建成后，全县一半以上的农户就可安上电灯，60％的工业将可用电做动力，有条件的公社将用电犁、电动收割机和电动脱粒机等农具进行生产。
    为了解决技术力量不足的困难，每个电站在建站前都先选派具有高小以上文化程度、思想好的青年，到已建成的电站去学习。
    器材设备不足的问题，通过自力更生为主，争取外援为辅，因陋就简，土法上马，就地取材也得到解决。
