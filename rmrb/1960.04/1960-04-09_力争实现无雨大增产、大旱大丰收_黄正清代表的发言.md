Comrades Representatives:
	I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Like all parts of the country, Gansu's situation in 1960 is still an extremely good one of continued great leaps forward. Now, I would like to share some opinions on Gansu's drought resistance and production.

	Since last winter, rainfall and snowfall in most parts of Gansu have been less than normal. From October last year to the end of February this year, rainfall decreased by about 20% compared to the same period in previous years, and even 13% less than the severe drought year of 1953. Nearly half of the province's cultivated land has insufficient soil moisture, and some cultivated land is severely lacking in moisture. These areas have been affected to varying degrees, whether in spring plowing and sowing or in the growth of winter wheat. Recently, there has been widespread rainfall in various parts of the province, and the situation has improved somewhat. However, according to meteorological forecasts, the drought situation is likely to continue to develop. At present, under the leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups throughout the province are launching a large-scale drought resistance and production campaign with the heroic spirit of "man can conquer nature," striving to achieve "a great increase in production without rain and a bumper harvest despite severe drought."

Wiping out drought in the winter
	As early as September last year, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a forecast to the people of the province based on meteorological forecasts that a drought might occur in 1960. In November, at the Provincial Six-Level Cadre Conference, the battle slogan "Eliminate Drought in Winter" was put forward, mobilizing the strength of all aspects of the province to make preparations ideologically, in action, and materially to fight against drought. Since the beginning of this year, the Provincial Party Committee has successively issued emergency instructions, proposing that drought resistance and production is the current overriding central task of the people of the province, that everything should be subordinate to drought resistance and production, and that everything should be for "bumper harvests despite severe drought." Under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities have actively carried out extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization, launching a mass debate on "Can we overcome drought?" and "How can we overcome drought?" This further criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few people, the world view of cowards and lazy people, and the mentality of relying on luck, and strengthened the confidence that man can conquer nature. The broad masses of the people responded enthusiastically to the call, and a vigorous drought resistance and production movement quickly unfolded vigorously throughout the province. A water conservancy army of nearly three million people, not avoiding difficulties and not fearing the cold, worked hard throughout the winter and spring, laying a good foundation for drought resistance and production. After this period of struggle, the broad masses of the people have become more energetic and high-spirited. The magnificent drought resistance and production movement is becoming more and more in-depth, progressing faster and faster, and advancing wave after wave.

Large-scale water conservancy construction, rapid irrigation
	In the drought resistance and production movement, we mainly focused on the following four specific measures:

	First, large-scale water conservancy construction is the fundamental way to overcome drought. According to the principle of "combining storage, diversion, and lifting, combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, with small-scale projects as the foundation and large-scale projects as the backbone," we have adopted measures such as rushing to complete current irrigation, vigorously developing groundwater, promoting economical water use, and fully utilizing the effectiveness of drainage and irrigation machinery. We strive to increase the actual irrigated area this year from more than 22 million mu last year to more than 30 million mu, that is, to make about half of the province's cultivated land irrigable.

	Rushing to complete current irrigation means shortening the battle line and concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles. Grasping the completion of water conservancy projects that can quickly exert actual benefits and put them into current irrigation as soon as possible. In addition to continuing to seize the construction of the 引洮 [Yin Tao] project, we comprehensively sorted out the large, medium, and small-scale projects under construction throughout the province according to the progress of the projects and the order of exerting benefits, and redeployed forces. First, we rushed to complete those that could be put into irrigation before summer sowing, second, those that could be put into autumn and winter irrigation, and temporarily postponed the rest. As of the end of September last year, the province had 51 reservoirs with a capacity of over one million cubic meters, with a total storage capacity of 300 million cubic meters. From October last year to February this year, 12 reservoirs with a capacity of over one million cubic meters were built, with a total storage capacity of 400 million cubic meters. There are currently 112 reservoirs with a capacity of over one million cubic meters under construction, of which 102 can be put into irrigation before summer sowing, with a storage capacity of 2.15 billion cubic meters; 10 can be put into autumn and winter irrigation, with a storage capacity of 2 billion cubic meters. It is estimated that the total storage capacity of projects that can be completed this year will be about 4.15 billion cubic meters, and the total water storage capacity will reach about 4.8 billion cubic meters, including the existing storage capacity of 700 million cubic meters. In order to ensure the construction of key projects, combined with the mass water conservancy movement, a professional water conservancy construction team of about 200,000 people has been established. At the same time, we vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of heavy physical operations such as excavation, loading, transportation, unloading, filling, and ramming, and promote the experience of directional blasting, loosening blasting, and comprehensive utilization of water conservancy, so that advanced machinery and equipment and advanced experience are matched into a dragon, striving to increase work efficiency by one to one and a half times this year. In addition, we also do not relax various temporary measures to increase current irrigation, such as using the ice melting season to intercept and store ice melting water, and actively carry out artificial melting of ice and snow in the Hexi Corridor, trying every possible means to increase the irrigated area.

	Fully utilizing groundwater is a drought resistance measure with less material consumption, less labor, and quick results, which can take effect immediately and quench the immediate thirst. Gansu has abundant groundwater resources. According to preliminary surveys, the Hexi Corridor alone has about 400 billion cubic meters, of which the shallow water layer has about 4 billion cubic meters. Some places that were previously considered impossible to draw water from have now surprisingly produced water. Minqin County, located on the edge of the Tengger Desert, has already dug more than 2,000 shallow underground ponds; Dongzhiyuan, 1,200 meters above sea level, which has never had a mu of irrigated land, has dug 170,000 wells since last winter, irrigating 480,000 mu of land; even in the arid mountainous area of Dingxi Chankou People's Commune, 2,000 meters above sea level, a number of wells have recently been drilled, generally only two or three zhang deep, thereby breaking the superstition that "there is no groundwater in high mountains" and opening up new avenues for water conservancy in arid mountainous areas. These vivid facts powerfully prove that there is water everywhere underground, all the time, as long as we conduct serious surveys and dig properly, there is no place where water cannot be dug out. The broad masses of the people, who have rich experience in fighting drought, have many creations for developing groundwater. For example, in places with high underground pressure, they dig artesian wells and semi-artesian wells; in places with deep groundwater, they dig deep wells and terrace wells; in places with high water sources and low terrain, they build dark tunnels and dig series wells to draw water to the surface. As the masses say, "There is water everywhere underground, it flows in the morning when you dig in the evening, it flows continuously throughout the year, and there will be a bumper harvest even if it doesn't rain."

Economical water use to expand irrigated areas
	Economical water use and fully exploiting the potential of existing water conservancy facilities to expand irrigated areas is a promising endeavor. The experience of Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in Yuzhong County in economical water use has been widely promoted throughout the province. This irrigation area has adopted a whole set of methods such as canal lining, complete canal systems, contiguous farmland, adjusting crops, quantitative water use, collecting small streams, and introducing floods, so that one flow of water irrigates more than 200,000 mu, setting a red flag in economical water use. At present, the average flow of water irrigates less than 50,000 mu throughout the province. After the experience of economical water use is widely promoted, we strive to increase it to 100,000 mu, so that we can increase tens of millions of mu of irrigated land.

	Strengthening the matching, installation, and maintenance of drainage and irrigation water lifting machinery and giving full play to the effectiveness of drainage and irrigation machinery is a major content of current industrial support for agriculture and support for drought resistance and production. As of the end of last year, the province had 692 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery used for farmland irrigation, with 28,500 horsepower, which had irrigated more than 474,000 mu. At present, 1,063 sets with 26,500 horsepower are being installed, repaired, and matched, and can be put into operation and use soon. This year, the central government has allocated another 60,000 horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery to our province, totaling more than 110,000 horsepower. After all of them are put into operation and use, they can irrigate about 2.3 million mu of cultivated land. In addition, the existing 28,000 waterwheels and more than 200,000 simple water lifting tools can also irrigate more than 1 million mu. The total of the two can irrigate more than 3 million mu.

	Second, give full play to the difference in land, put forward different requirements for various types of land, use insurance land to drive general land, use water to protect drought, and use abundance to compensate for deficiencies, and strive for a bumper harvest despite severe drought.

	According to the drought resistance capacity of different regions and different land, we have calculated a large account. Of the province's 60 million mu of cultivated land, more than 20 million mu are insured irrigated land, with more than 10 million mu vigorously engaged in high-yield plots to achieve high-yield production; the remaining more than 10 million mu of insured irrigated land, 8 million mu of high-cold and humid land, and 1.5 million mu of sand-covered land, totaling more than 20 million mu, can all ensure planting and harvest, with an increase of 10% to 15% compared to last year; general land with certain drought resistance conditions, about 14 million mu, with an increase of about 5% compared to last year; about 13 million mu of land that is seriously threatened by drought and has poor drought resistance conditions, strive to ensure seedling emergence and seedling protection. In order to first seize a bumper harvest of summer crops, at present, in agriculture, we first list drought resistance spring sowing as the primary task of the assault. Various localities have started early and acted quickly, adopted a variety of drought resistance and high-yield crops, and seized moisture to plant, so as to cultivate well and plant well, and ensure planting and emergence. In areas with severe drought, we have also prepared several sets of seeds, plant autumn crops if summer crops cannot be planted, plant large autumn crops if autumn crops cannot be planted, and plant vegetables if late autumn crops cannot be planted. The second is drought resistance to protect wheat and strengthen field management. At present, we must first manage more than 10 million mu of winter wheat, organize professional teams to seize the work of watering, moisture conservation, top dressing, and disease and pest control. For winter wheat and spring wheat, we must try every means to manage well, carefully, and thoroughly, seize a bumper harvest of summer crops, and lay a material foundation for drought resistance.

	Third, carry out a mass movement throughout the province to increase "100 catties of potatoes and 100 catties of pumpkins" per person. As soon as the Provincial Party Committee put forward this call, it was warmly responded to by the broad masses of the people throughout the province. Whether it is office cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, college and middle school students, workers, farmers, or urban residents, all those who have the ability to work have already been and are being put into this movement, everyone is striving to be the first, and everyone is full of energy. They use their spare time to find seeds, open up wasteland, and try every possible means to plant extensively in front of and behind houses, in courtyards, beside water, beside roads, on barren slopes, and in barren ditches.

	Carrying out this movement not only increases material strength for drought resistance and production, but more importantly, through this movement, it has mobilized the positive factors of all aspects, fully tapped all potential strength, and used all available land and resources, so that everyone with the ability to work can contribute to drought resistance and be involved in this struggle without exception. By personally participating in labor, they receive the most practical and profound ideological education, so that drought resistance and production truly forms a mass movement.

	Fourth, strengthen the leadership of the Party and organize communist large-scale cooperation. Strengthening the leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee for the victory of the drought resistance and production movement. The province has established a Water Conservancy Construction Committee, and powerful drought resistance and production headquarters have been established at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, led by the secretaries, to strengthen specific leadership and conduct comprehensive arrangements. A number of short and capable inspection teams have also been organized to go deep into the field to inspect and promote work.

	Under the unified leadership of the Party, the forces of all aspects of the province, including workers, peasants, commerce, students, and soldiers, have all been organized around the central task of drought resistance and production for communist large-scale cooperation. Everyone is united, pooling their wisdom and efforts, twisting into one force, and putting out even greater effort than the large-scale steelmaking in 1958, launching a wave of supporting drought resistance and production. Everything is subordinate to drought resistance and production, and everything is for the realization of a bumper harvest despite severe drought. The industrial sector lists the machinery and materials necessary for drought resistance and production as the first line and produces them in advance. The transportation sector works overtime to rush to transport drought resistance materials. The commercial sector ensures that it plays the role of the logistics department for drought resistance and production, arranging, allocating, and supplying drought resistance materials first. Scientific research departments are seizing the research and solving of a series of scientific and technological problems in drought resistance and production. Students above junior high school also help nearby people's communes with drought resistance and production. The heroic People's Liberation Army units have carried forward their glorious traditions and actively participated in the drought resistance struggle.

	The drought resistance struggle in the past six months has achieved great results and laid the foundation for our victory. The province has newly built more than 7.7 million mu of irrigated land, and the total irrigated land, including the original irrigated land, is more than 29 million mu. More than 17.5 million mu have been winter irrigated, and more than 5.3 million mu have been spring irrigated. More than 12.6 million mu have been sown, accounting for one-third of the plan. 60% of winter wheat has been watered and 90% has been top-dressed, and it is generally growing well. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, with full mobilization of the masses, continued efforts, and relentless efforts to carry out the drought resistance struggle to the end, even if a major drought is formed, the total grain output will definitely exceed last year and achieve "a great increase in production without rain and a bumper harvest despite severe drought."

	Comrades Representatives, although Gansu's drought situation this year is more serious than in previous years and the task of drought resistance struggle is still very arduous, we are fully confident and sure to overcome drought and win a bumper harvest. We have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the general line of socialist construction and a set of two-legged walking policies, the people's communes with strong vitality, and the vast people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and full of energy, which is the guarantee for our success. As a folk song sings well: "Even if the sky collapses this year due to drought, the commune has the strength to withstand it; if the sky does not rain, people will rain, and the bumper harvest is in our hands." Our drought resistance struggle must be victorious and will surely be victorious.

	Please correct any inappropriate points in the above speech.

### 力争实现无雨大增产、大旱大丰收  黄正清代表的发言

专栏：

    力争实现无雨大增产、大旱大丰收
    黄正清代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念副总理的报告。我们甘肃和全国各地一样，1960年，仍然是一个极为良好的继续大跃进的形势。现在，我就甘肃的抗旱生产情况，讲一些意见。
    去年冬季以来，甘肃大部分地区雨雪少于常年。从去年10月到今年2月底，降雨量比历年同期减少20％左右，比大旱的1953年，还少13％。全省有将近一半的耕地墒气不足，部分耕地严重缺墒。这些地区，不论春耕播种和冬麦生长，都不同程度地受到一些影响，最近，全省各地普遍下了一些雨，情况有所好转。但据气象预测，旱情仍有继续发展的趋势。目前，全省各族人民在党的领导下，正以人定胜天的英雄气概，掀起了大规模的抗旱生产运动的高潮，力争实现“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收。”
    把干旱消灭在冬季
    早在去年9月中共甘肃省委就根据气象预报，向全省人民发出了1960年可能发生旱象的预告。11月间，又在省六级干部会议上提出了“把干旱消灭在冬季”的战斗口号，动员全省各方面的力量，从思想上，行动上和物质上作好准备，与干旱作斗争。今年以来，省委又接连发布了紧急指示，提出抗旱生产是全省人民当前压倒一切的中心任务，一切服从抗旱生产，一切为了“大旱大丰收”。在省委的号召下，各地积极进行了广泛深入的思想发动工作，开展了“能不能战胜干旱”，“怎样战胜干旱”的全民大辩论。进一步批判了少数人的右倾保守思想、懦夫懒汉的世界观和靠天吃饭的侥幸心理，坚定了人定胜天的信心。广大群众热烈响应号召，一个轰轰烈烈的抗旱生产运动，很快就在全省范围内蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。近三百万人的水利大军，不避艰难，不畏严寒，大干了一冬一春，为抗旱生产打下了良好基础。经过这一段斗争，广大群众更加精神焕发，斗志昂扬。波澜壮阔的抗旱生产运动，愈来愈深入，进展愈来愈快，一浪高过一浪地向前推进。
    大兴水利，突击现灌
    在抗旱生产运动中，我们主要抓紧了以下四个具体措施：
    首先是大兴水利，这是战胜干旱的根本办法。根据“蓄引提并举，大中小结合，小型为基础，大型为骨干”的方针，我们采取了突击现灌，大搞地下水，推广经济用水及充分发挥排灌机械的效能等措施，力争今年水地实灌面积由去年的二千二百多万亩增加到三千万多亩，也就是使全省一半左右的耕地，都能灌上水。
    突击现灌，就是缩短战线，集中力量打歼灭战。抓紧完成很快能发挥实际效益的水利工程，迅速投入现灌，除引洮工程继续抓紧修建以外，我们根据工程的进度和发挥效益的先后，将全省正在施工的大中小型工程，进行全面排队，重新部署力量。首先突击完成夏播前能投入灌溉的，其次完成能投入秋灌和冬灌的，其余的暂时推后一步。截至去年9月底，全省原有百万立米以上的水库五十一座，总库容三亿立米。去年10月至今年2月，建成百万立米以上的水库十二座，总库容四亿立米。现在正在施工的百万立米以上的水库一百一十二座，其中在夏播前能投入灌溉的有一百零二座，库容二十一亿五千立米；能投入秋灌和冬灌的有十座，库容二十亿立米。估计今年可以完成的工程总库容为四十一亿五千立米左右，连同已有的库容量七亿立米，总蓄水能力可达到四十八亿立米左右。为了保证重点工程的建设，结合群众性的水利运动，建立了二十万人左右的水利建设专业队。同时，大搞技术革新和技术革命，实现挖、装、运、卸、填、夯等重体力操作的机械化和半机械化，并且推广定向爆破，松动爆破和水利综合利用等经验，使先进机具和先进经验配套成龙，争取今年提高工效一倍到一倍半。此外，我们也不放松增加现灌的各种临时措施，如利用消冰季节，拦蓄消冰水，在河西走廊，积极进行人工融化冰雪工作等，千方百计地增加灌溉面积。
    充分利用地下水，是一个用材少、费工小、收效快的抗旱措施，可以立竿见影，近水解近渴。甘肃地下水源丰富，据初步勘察，单是河西走廊就有四千亿立米左右，其中，浅水层约有四十亿立米。一些过去被认为根本打不出水的地方，现在也破天荒地打出了水。位于腾格里沙漠边缘的民勤县，已经挖了两千多个地下浅塘；拔海一千二百米、从来没有一亩水地的董志塬，去年冬季以来，打了十七万眼井，浇地四十八万亩；就是在干旱的高山区拔海二千米的定西巉口人民公社，最近也打成了一批水井，一般也只两三丈深，从而破除了“高山无地下水”的迷信，为干旱山区的水利化开辟了新的途径。这些生动的事实有力地证明，地下处处有水，时时有水，只要认真勘察，挖掘得法，没有挖不出水来的。与干旱斗争具有丰富经验的广大人民群众，对于开发地下水有许多创造。例如在地下压力大的地方打自流井、半自流井，在地下水深的地方打深井、台阶井，在水源高、地势低的地方修暗洞、打串井，将水引出地面。群众说得好：“地下水到处有，早上挖晚上流，一年流的不断头，天不下雨也丰收”。
    经济用水，扩大灌溉面积
    经济用水，充分发挥现有水利设施的潜在力量，扩大灌溉面积。这是大有可为的。在全省普遍推广了榆中县兴隆峡灌区经济用水的经验。这个灌区采取渠道衬砌，渠系成套，园田连片，调整作物，定量用水，汇集细流和引进洪水等一整套办法，使一个流量的水灌溉二十多万亩，在经济用水方面树立了一面红旗。目前全省平均一个流量灌地还不到五万亩，普遍推广经济用水的经验之后，力争提高到灌十万亩，这样，就能增加上千万亩水地。
    加强排灌提水机械的配套、安装和检修，充分发挥排灌机械的效能，这是当前工业支援农业、支援抗旱生产的一个主要内容。截至去年底，全省原有用于农田灌溉的排灌机械，已经运转使用的六百九十二台、两万八千五百马力，已灌了四十七万四千多亩。目前正在安装、检修、配套，很快可以运转使用的一千零六十三台、两万六千五百马力。今年中央又给我省调拨六万马力的排灌机械。共十一万多马力。全部运转使用后，大约可灌二百三十多万亩耕地。再加上原有的两万八千多部水车和二十多万件简易提水工具，还可以灌溉一百多万亩。两者合计共可灌溉三百多万亩。
    第二、充分利用土地的差别性，给各类土地提出不同要求，以保险田带动一般田，以水保旱，以丰补欠，力争大旱大丰收。
    我们根据不同地区不同土地的抗旱能力，算了一笔大账，全省六千万亩耕地，其中保险水地二千万亩以上，以一千多万亩大搞丰产方，达到高额丰产；下余一千多万亩保险水地和八百万亩高寒阴湿地、一百五十万亩压砂地，共约二千万亩以上，都可以保种保收，比去年增产10％到15％；有一定抗旱条件的一般田，约有一千四百多万亩，比去年产量增产5％左右；干旱威胁较严重，抗旱条件较差的地约有一千三百多万亩，力争出苗保苗。为了首先夺得夏田大丰收，当前在农业方面，首先把抗旱春播列为首要的突击任务。各地动手早、行动快，采取多种抗旱高产作物，抢墒下种，做到耕好种好，保种保出。在旱象严重的地区，还准备了几套种子，夏田种不成种秋田，大秋种不成种晚秋，晚秋种不成种蔬菜。其次是抗旱保麦，加强田间管理。当前首先管好一千多万亩冬麦，组织专业队，抓紧浇水、保墒、追肥和防治病虫害等工作。对冬麦和春麦，想尽一切办法，管好、管细、管到底，夺得夏田丰收，为抗旱打下物质基础。
    第三、在全省范围内开展每人增产“百斤洋芋，百斤南瓜”的群众运动。省委一提出这个号召，就得到全省广大人民的热烈响应。无论是机关干部、解放军战士、大中学生、工人、农民或是城市居民，凡是有劳动能力的人，都已经和正在投入这个运动，人人奋勇争先，个个干劲十足。他们利用业余时间，到处找籽种、开荒地，想尽一切办法，在房前屋后，院内空场、水旁路旁，荒坡荒沟等地，见缝插针，广为种植。
    开展这个运动，不仅为抗旱生产增加物质力量，更重要的是通过这个运动调动了各方面的积极因素，充分挖掘了一切潜在力量，利用一切可以利用的土地、资源，使每一个有劳动能力的人，都能为抗旱出力，都毫无例外地投入这场斗争。通过亲自参加劳动，受到最实际、最深刻的思想教育，从而使抗旱生产真正形成全民运动。
    第四、加强党的领导，组织共产主义大协作。加强党的领导，这是抗旱生产运动取得胜利的最根本的保证。省上成立了水利建设委员会，省、专、县各级都成立了强有力的抗旱生产指挥部，由书记挂帅，加强具体领导，进行全面安排。并组织了一批短小精悍的检查小组，深入实地检查，推动工作。
    在党的统一领导下，全省工农商学兵，各方面的力量，都环绕抗旱生产这个中心任务，组织了共产主义大协作。大家同心同德，群策群力，扭成了一股劲，拿出比1958年大炼钢铁还要大的劲头，掀起了支援抗旱生产的热潮。一切服从抗旱生产，一切为了实现大旱大丰收。工业部门将抗旱生产所必需的机械、物资列为第一线，提前生产。交通运输部门，加班赶运抗旱物资。商业部门保证当好抗旱生产的后勤部，对抗旱物资安排在先、调拨在先、供应在先。科学研究部门，正在抓紧研究解决抗旱生产中一系列的科学技术问题。初中以上的学生，也帮助附近人民公社抗旱生产。英勇的人民解放军部队，发扬了光荣传统，积极地参加了抗旱斗争。
    半年来的抗旱斗争，已经取得了巨大的成绩，为我们的胜利奠定了基础。全省已新修水地七百七十多万亩，连原有水地总计共有水地二千九百多万亩，冬灌了一千七百五十多万亩。春灌五百三十多万亩。已经播种了一千二百六十多万亩，占计划的三分之一。冬麦已有60％浇了水，90％追了肥，一般都生长良好。我们深信，在党的领导下，充分发动群众，继续鼓足更大干劲，再接再厉，把抗旱斗争进行到底，即使形成大旱，粮食总产量，一定能够超过去年，实现“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”。
    各位代表，尽管甘肃今年旱情比往年严重，抗旱斗争任务还很艰巨，但我们完全有信心、有把握战胜干旱，夺得大丰收。我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有社会主义建设总路线和一套两条腿走路的方针，有具有强大生命力的人民公社，又有以毛泽东思想武装起来的干劲冲天的广大人民，这就是我们能够取得胜利的保证。有一首民歌唱得好：“那怕今年天旱塌，公社有力扛住它；天不下雨人下雨，丰收在咱手中抓”。我们的抗旱斗争，一定要胜利，也一定能够胜利。
    以上发言，不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
