The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Congress Presents Battle Missions to the People of the Province
Accelerate the Pace of Socialist Construction

    (Reported by this newspaper) Under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ahead in the new stage of socialist construction, continuously and at high speed develop the national economy proportionately, comprehensively accelerate the technological revolution and cultural revolution, consolidate and improve the people's communes, and strive for continuous and comprehensive great leaps forward and bumper harvests. This is the combat mission proposed to the party organizations and people of the entire province by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at the first meeting of its Second Congress held from March 15th to 24th.
    At this meeting, Comrade Ouyang Qin first delivered a work report on behalf of the previous provincial party committee entitled: "Hold High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Forge Ahead in the New Stage of Socialist Construction," and passed a resolution on the work report of the provincial party committee. The meeting elected the new Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with 52 comrades including Ouyang Qin elected as members of the provincial party committee, and 19 comrades elected as alternate members. The meeting demonstrated that the Marxist-Leninist level of the party organizations throughout the province had been further improved, the unity had been unprecedentedly strengthened, and the thinking had been unprecedentedly unified. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the meeting summarized the experience of various tasks in the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, clearly analyzed the new situation, and determined the new tasks for the new stage. It was a meeting to improve thinking, as well as a mobilization and oath-taking meeting to further accelerate the pace of socialist construction in the entire province.
    The meeting held that the cause of socialist construction in Heilongjiang Province, like other parts of the country, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, has entered a new stage of high-speed development due to the great victories of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and the continuous two years of Great Leap Forward achievements. Now a new upsurge of socialist construction has formed throughout the province, and this new upsurge includes: a new upsurge of studying Marxist-Leninist theory centered on studying Mao Zedong Thought; a new upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; a new upsurge of cultural revolution centered on popularizing and improving universal education and climbing the peaks of science and culture; a new upsurge of comprehensively organizing the people's economic and cultural life centered on developing collective welfare undertakings. It is estimated that more than five million people in the province are now participating in the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. The technical revolution movement is surging forward. As of March 20th, statistics show that the industrial sector alone had 41 basically automated factories, 167 basically automated workshops, 3,030 automated production lines, and 5,950 automated single machines. The degree of mechanization in the province's industrial sector increased from 37.8% at the beginning of the year to about 60%. Mass activities for vigorously running science and education, university culture, and vigorously developing literature, art, health, and sports are also rising vigorously. Illiteracy among young and middle-aged people will soon be completely eliminated. In Harbin alone, 30 factories have established employee spare-time universities. Because communes have been realized in both urban and rural areas, public canteens, service stations, nurseries, kindergartens and other undertakings have greatly developed, the socialization of housework has progressed extremely rapidly, and the communist morality of mutual assistance and close cooperation has grown rapidly. These several mass movements, with politics as the commander, production as the center, and the people's communes as the foundation, promote each other, forming the distinct characteristics of the current situation, converging into a surging torrent, fiercely washing away the traces left over from the old society, and drastically changing the political, economic, cultural, and living aspects of the entire society. Socialist construction in the entire province is thriving and changing with each passing day, with new things emerging one after another, presenting a situation of ten thousand horses galloping and advancing a thousand miles a day, and unfolding infinitely beautiful prospects.
    After analyzing the excellent situation of socialist construction in the province, based on the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the spirit of the central instructions, and proceeding from the actual situation of the province's current socialist construction, the meeting pointed out that the tasks of the province in the new stage are: hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite as one, adhere to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen political and ideological work, continue to eliminate all bourgeois ideological influences, and continuously improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the people; further comprehensively consolidate and improve the people's communes, and fully utilize the superiority of the communes; in accordance with the spirit of "tapping potential, supporting the whole country, comprehensively developing, and rationally laying out" and "relying on the Party, relying on the masses, having a center and backbone, and comprehensively planning and comprehensively leaping forward," under the unified planning of the central government, with industry as the leading factor and agriculture as the foundation, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and in accordance with the development policy of "high, large, fine, cutting-edge, new, agriculture, light industry, small and mass," strengthen the construction of weak links, develop the national economy comprehensively, proportionally, and at high speed; comprehensively accelerate the technological revolution and cultural revolution, realize the technological transformation of the national economy, establish a strong scientific and technological contingent and a Marxist-Leninist theoretical contingent, develop cutting-edge technology, and climb the peaks of science and culture; strive for continuous and comprehensive great leaps forward and bumper harvests, and build Heilongjiang Province into a more prosperous, happy, and beautiful place with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture; and under the principle of the whole country as a chess game, closely cooperate with fraternal provinces, build a relatively complete economic system in the Northeast region that coordinates and cooperates with all parts of the country; in order to better complete the task of vigorously supporting the whole country, make greater contributions to the cause of building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense, and gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production.
    In order to ensure the completion of various tasks in the new stage, the meeting believes that the most important thing is to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, continuously improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the people, establish communist ambitions, and promote a vigorous, daring, and realistic, in-depth mass, humble, and simple style, to ensure the high-speed development of socialist construction.
    The meeting believes that accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link in the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. In the comprehensive development of the national economy, it is necessary to implement the policy of taking industry as the leading factor, agriculture as the foundation, and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, so that the development of agriculture and industry can adapt to the needs of improving people's lives, and better complete the task of vigorously supporting the whole country with agricultural products. To this end, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward, fully utilize the superiority of the people's communes, accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture centered on mechanization, and strive to realize agricultural mechanization in the next five years. Vigorously carry out basic farmland construction centered on water conservancy, further comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" and various high-yield and bumper harvest policies, strive to increase yield per unit area, actively expand cultivated land area, further increase grain production, vigorously develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising and other diversified operations, and vigorously carry out afforestation, realize a continuous and comprehensive great leap forward and bumper harvest of grain, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and realize the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    In the industrial field, the meeting proposed that in order to vigorously support the whole country and carry out the technological transformation of the national economy, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward, and continue to give priority to the development of heavy industry in the province. To this end, it is necessary to continue to develop and improve industries such as iron and steel, machinery, and coal, fully tap potential, strengthen weak links, vigorously develop the radio electronics industry, and especially rapidly develop the raw material industry and comprehensive utilization, and strive to establish a strong iron and steel industry with reasonable layout and a combination of large, medium, and small enterprises in the shortest possible time. It is necessary to fully utilize the role of the "small mass" groups, vigorously develop the chemical industry, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, especially petroleum production. Actively develop light industry, so that it adapts to the needs of heavy industry and people's lives, and strive for basic self-sufficiency in light industrial products in three to five years.
    The meeting proposed that striving to develop science and technology, especially cutting-edge science and technology, is an extremely important and urgent political task for the entire party. It is necessary to comprehensively plan, strengthen leadership, vigorously develop scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, establish a strong scientific and technological contingent that is both red and expert, accelerate the development of science and technology, and fully utilize the revolutionary and enterprising spirit and creativity of the masses in climbing the peaks of science.
    The meeting believes that consolidating and improving the people's communes in urban and rural areas of the province is an important guarantee for completing various construction tasks in the new stage and realizing a continuous and comprehensive great leap forward and bumper harvest. People's communes have been realized in both urban and rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, and are currently advancing on the road of consolidation and sound development. The future task is to further comprehensively improve the urban and rural people's communes to a new level politically, economically, and organizationally, fully utilize the superiority of the communes, and enable them to play a greater role in the new stage of socialist construction. The meeting emphasized that to consolidate and improve the people's communes, the current focus should be on vigorously developing production, vigorously carrying out technological revolution and cultural revolution, popularizing theoretical learning, comprehensively organizing the people's lives, improving leadership style, and improving leadership level.
    Finally, the meeting proposed that the key to completing various major tasks in the new stage lies in holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening the Party's leadership, strengthening the Party's ideological and organizational construction, further enhancing the Party's unity, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, criticizing modern revisionism, overcoming the influence of bourgeois ideology, and continuously improving the socialist and communist consciousness of the people. The congress believes that under the rapid development of socialist construction, comrades throughout the province must strictly prevent the emergence of pride, firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's earnest teaching that "modesty helps one to make progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," be neither humble nor arrogant, study hard, overcome shortcomings, strengthen investigation and research, and continuously summarize experience to ensure the continuous and leap-forward advancement of the socialist cause.

    黑龙江省党代会向全省人民提出战斗任务
    加速社会主义建设步伐
    本报讯　高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，在社会主义建设新阶段中，奋勇前进，持续地高速度按比例地发展国民经济，全面地加速进行技术革命、文化革命，巩固提高人民公社，力争持续的全面的大跃进、大丰收。这是中共黑龙江省委在3月15日至24日召开的第二届代表大会第一次会议向全省党组织、全省人民提出的战斗任务。
    这次会议，首先听取了欧阳钦同志代表前届省委所作的题为：“高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，在社会主义建设新阶段中奋勇前进”的工作报告。并通过了关于省委工作报告的决议。会议选举出新的中共黑龙江省委员会，欧阳钦同志等五十二人当选为省委委员，十九人当选为候补委员。会议表现了全省党组织的马克思列宁主义水平进一步提高，团结空前增强，思想空前一致；这次会议在毛泽东思想指导下，总结了过去几年特别是大跃进以来各项工作的经验，明确地分析了新形势，确定了新阶段的新任务，是一次提高思想的会议，也是进一步加速全省社会主义建设步伐的动员和誓师的会议。
    会议认为：黑龙江省的社会主义建设事业和全国各地一样，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，由于总路线、大跃进、人民公社取得了巨大的胜利，连续两年实现了大跃进，已经进入了高速度发展的新阶段。现在全省已经形成了一个全民性的社会主义建设的新高潮，这个新高潮包含着：以学习毛泽东思想为中心的学习马克思列宁主义理论的新高潮；以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命的新高潮；以普及提高全民教育、攀登科学文化高峰为中心的文化革命的新高潮；以发展集体福利事业为中心的全面组织人民经济文化生活的新高潮。现在全省人民参加学习马克思列宁主义，毛泽东著作的估计已达五百万人以上。技术革命运动奔腾澎湃，到3月20日统计，全省仅工业部门即已出现基本自动化的工厂四十一个，基本自动化的车间一百六十七个，自动化生产线三千零三十条，自动化单机五千九百五十台，全省工业部门机械化程度由年初的37.8％提高到60％左右。群众性的大办科学教育、大学文化、大搞文艺卫生体育的活动也正在风起云涌，青壮年文盲即将全部扫除，仅哈尔滨市即有三十个工厂办了职工业余大学。由于城乡都实现了公社化，公共食堂、服务站、托儿所、幼儿园等事业大为发展，家务劳动社会化进展极其迅速，互相帮助、密切协作的共产主义道德风尚迅速成长。这几个群众运动的高潮，以政治为统帅，以生产为中心，以人民公社为基础，互相促进，形成当前形势的鲜明特征，汇成汹涌澎湃的巨流，猛烈地冲洗着旧社会残留下来的斑痕，急剧地改变着整个社会的政治、经济、文化和生活的面貌，使全省的社会主义建设欣欣向荣、日新月异、新鲜事物层出不穷，呈现了万马奔腾、一日千里的形势，展开了无限美好的前景。
    会议分析了全省社会主义建设的大好形势之后，根据党的社会主义建设总路线和中央指示精神，从全省当前社会主义建设的实际情况出发，指出了全省在新阶段中的任务是：高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，团结一致，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社，加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作，继续肃清一切资产阶级思想影响，不断提高人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟；进一步全面巩固提高人民公社，充分发挥公社的优越性；按照“挖掘潜力、支援全国、全面发展、合理布局”和“依靠党、依靠群众，有中心、有骨干，全面规划、全面跃进”的精神，在中央统一规划下，以工业为主导，以农业为基础，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，依据“高、大、精、尖、新、农、轻、小洋群”的发展方针，加强薄弱环节的建设，高速度按比例地全面发展国民经济；全面地加速进行技术革命、文化革命，实现国民经济的技术改造，建立强大的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论队伍，发展尖端技术，攀登科学文化高峰；力争持续的全面的大跃进、大丰收，把黑龙江省建设成具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学文化的更加繁荣幸福美丽的地方；并在全国一盘棋的方针下，和兄弟省密切协作，在东北地区建成与全国各地配合协作而又比较完整的经济体系；以更好地完成大力支援全国的任务，在把我国建设成具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学文化、现代化国防的伟大的社会主义国家的事业中，作出更大的贡献，并在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民的物质、文化生活水平。
    为了保证完成新阶段的各项任务，会议认为最重要的是要认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作，不断提高人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，树立共产主义的雄心大志，发扬生气勃勃，敢想敢干而又实事求是、深入群众、谦虚朴素的作风，保证社会主义建设高速度向前发展。
    会议认为：加速发展农业是高速度按比例发展国民经济的中心环节。在全面发展国民经济中，必须贯彻执行以工业为主导，以农业为基础，优先发展重工业与迅速发展农业相结合的方针，使农业与工业的发展及人民生活提高的需要相适应，并更好地完成在农产品上大力支援全国的任务。为此，要继续贯彻以粮为纲，全面跃进的方针，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，加速实现以机械化为中心的农业技术改造，力争在今后五年内实现农业机械化。大力进行以水利为中心的农田基本建设，进一步全面贯彻“八字宪法”和多种高产丰收的方针，努力提高单位面积产量，积极扩大耕地面积，进一步增加粮食生产，大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业及其他多种经营，大规模地进行植树造林，实现以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔持续、全面的大跃进、大丰收，提前实现农业发展纲要。
    在工业方面，会议提出为了大力支援全国和进行国民经济的技术改造，必须继续贯彻执行以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，继续优先发展全省的重工业。为此，要继续发展和提高钢铁、机械、煤炭等工业，充分挖掘潜力，加强薄弱环节，努力发展无线电电子工业，特别要迅速发展原材料工业和综合利用，力争在最短时间内，建立起布局合理、大中小结合的强大钢铁工业，必须充分发挥“小洋群”的作用，大力发展化学工业、有色金属、稀有金属特别是石油的生产。积极发展轻工业，使其与重工业及人民生活需要相适应，争取轻工业产品在三、五年内基本自给。
    会议提出努力发展科学技术，特别是尖端科学技术，是全党的一项极为重要和迫切的政治任务。要全面规划，加强领导，大力发展科学文教事业，建立一支强大的、又红又专的科学技术队伍，加速发展科学技术，充分发挥群众攀登科学高峰的革命进取精神和创造性。
    会议认为，巩固提高全省城市和农村人民公社，是完成新阶段各项建设任务，实现持续的全面的大跃进、大丰收的重要保证。黑龙江全省城市和农村都已实现了人民公社化，目前正在巩固的、健全发展的道路上前进，今后任务是进一步从政治上、经济上，组织上把城乡人民公社全面地提高到新的水平，充分发挥公社的优越性，使其在社会主义建设新阶段中发挥更伟大的作用。会议强调：巩固提高人民公社，当前要以大力发展生产为中心，大搞技术革命、文化革命，普及理论学习，全面地组织好人民生活，改进领导作风，提高领导水平。
    会议最后提出，完成新阶段各项重大任务的关键，在于高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，加强党的领导，加强党的思想建设与组织建设，进一步增强党的团结，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，批判现代修正主义，克服资产阶级思想影响，不断提高人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟。大会认为：在社会主义建设飞速发展的情况下，全省同志都必须严格防止骄傲情绪的产生，牢记毛泽东同志谆谆教导的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的真理，既不自卑，也不自大，努力学习，克服缺点，加强调查研究，不断总结经验，以保证社会主义事业持续飞跃地前进。
