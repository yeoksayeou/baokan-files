    I am attending the two sessions' conference despite my illness, and I fully agree with and support the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I am particularly excited by Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, which mentioned the imminent arrival of a cultural upsurge. Therefore, I am making this written statement.

    The report quotes Chairman Mao's classic saying that "with the advent of an economic construction upsurge, a cultural construction upsurge will inevitably appear." This thorough and clear foresight has been fully demonstrated by Vice Premier Li's report.

    Generally speaking, the prosperity of a country, society, or nation has many causes, but the actual foundation is still the depth and vitality of its culture. In the past, our country was indeed proud of its deep cultural foundation, but due to the limitations of the times and other conditions, it cannot be applied unchanged to meet the needs of the current situation and the masses. This goes without saying. Our Party and state leadership recognized this early on. Therefore, from the beginning of the founding of the Party and the country, we have been engaged in the brewing of revolutionary culture. Thus, Chairman Mao's Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, as well as various literary and art organizations that opposed imperialism, anti-Japanese aggression, anti-capitalism, and anti-dictatorship, and promoted new democracy, socialism, and communism, have exerted unparalleled power and played a significant role in the continuous struggle. Under the banner of the three red flags (General Line, Great Leap Forward, People's Communes), all construction has taken on a soaring momentum, emerging everywhere at an incredible pace. In particular, the economy and science have converged into countless torrents. Therefore, other aspects (especially culture) must cooperate with the leap forward and develop in an all-round way, especially emphasizing the leadership of the Party. This ensures that the power of culture permeates everything, penetrating every pore, like a river network, so as to unleash the potential and new forces of our historically long-standing and multi-ethnic family. This will produce a unique and brand-new culture in the 20th century world, setting a good example for socialist countries. This is a task that our country cannot avoid in this era.

    At present, our country's literacy work is progressing rapidly, and various literary, cultural relics, historical literature, documents, and writing works have taken root and deepened. Its proportion to various departments is very different from before. Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that in 1960, a greater cultural construction upsurge will be launched across the country, striving to climb the world peak in a not-too-long time, and pointed out that a batch of funds of about 12 billion yuan outside the national budget can be used, and the funds within the national budget can be used in a balanced way. This is so exciting.

    I think this year is the first year of the 1960s. Can we set a festival called "Cultural Rebirth Festival" on a certain day of a certain month this year to show the world that our country has a special status and achievements in today's inheritance, development, and creation of culture. On the one hand, actively mobilize the masses, arouse the revolutionary spirit of the whole country, promote the communist style, improve their spiritual life, and eliminate their corrupt and backward thinking. The so-called rebirth is neither conservative and inherited, nor mechanically copied, but precisely a harmonious blend, which can also be said to be a transformation. Such a culture is exactly what our country needs today, or it can be said to be the culture that the world needs today. As for how to investigate, study, discuss, plan, and even all the guidelines, methods, processes, and how to divide into phases, regions, and categories, so that creation and transformation, popularization and improvement can be taken into account, and this work can be done in a faster, better, and more economical way, to prepare for the transition from socialist society to communist society, and to complete this historical task, I think it is still arduous and complex. How should the Party and state leadership take overall responsibility for everything and divide the work for cooperation? My thinking is not comprehensive, and I dare not lightly propose. I will wait for everyone to discuss it.

### 为我国崭新的文化而自豪  叶恭绰委员的发言

    为我国崭新的文化而自豪
    叶恭绰委员的发言
    这次我扶病出席列席两会议的大会，听取两位李副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，我都充分赞成和拥护，尤其李先念副总理报告中，说及文化高潮即将到来，令我特别兴奋，因此做这书面发言。
    报告中引用我毛主席经典性的名言说“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”，这种透彻明确的预见性，业经由李副总理的此次报告中充分证明。
    大凡一个国家社会民族的兴盛，其原因故有多端，而实际基础，仍系乎文化的深度和活力，我国往昔，固时以有深度的文化基础自豪，但因时代和其他条件的限制，今天不能原封不动的来适应时局和群众的需要，这是不待言的。我党国领导方面，早见及此。故建党建国之初，即从事革命文化的酝酿，因此毛主席延安文艺的座谈和反帝、反日、反资本、反独裁，以至宣传新民主主义、社会主义、共产主义各式各样的文工组织，于不断战斗中，都发挥了无比的威力，起了很多很大的作用，目下在三面大红旗（总路线，大跃进，人民公社）招展之下，一切建设，都已形成一飞冲天一日千里之势，随时随地，一涌而出，尤其经济、科学，已汇成无数巨流，因此在其他方面（尤其文化方面）必须配合跃进，全面发展，尤其注重党的领导一点，使文化的力量，浸透一切，无孔不入，如河网化一般，方能发挥融汇我历史悠久和多民族的大家庭的潜在力量和新生力量，产生二十世纪世界上特有而崭新的文化，为社会主义国家，做出好榜样，这是我国在这时代所不能避免的任务。
    现在我国扫盲工作，迅速进展，各种文艺、文物、文史、文献、文字的工作，均已扎根深入，其与各部门的比重，已与前大大不同，李先念副总理所说1960年在全国范围内将掀起一个更大的文化建设高潮，争取在不太长的时间内攀登世界高峰，并指出可以利用在国家预算以外一批资金约一百二十亿元，综合国家预算内资金平衡使用，这是多么令人兴奋的事。
    我想今年是六十年代的第一年，我们是否可于今年某月日，定出一个节日称为“文化新生节”来昭示全世界，俾知我国在今天对文化的继往开来和创造，都有其特殊地位和成就一方面，积极发动群众，鼓起全国的革命精神，发扬共产主义风格，改进其精神生活，剔除其腐朽落后思想，所谓新生，既不是保守因袭，也不是生搬硬套，而正是水乳交融也可说是脱胎换骨，这样的文化，恰是我国今天所需要的文化，或亦可说是今天世界上所需要的文化，至如何调查、研究、讨论、计划，以至一切方针、方法、进程和如何分期、分区、分类，使创造和改造，普及与提高，都能顾到，多快好省地做好这一工作，为由社会主义社会进入共产主义社会的预备先头工作，来完成这一宗历史任务，我想仍是艰巨而复杂的，应如何由党国领导方面，统筹一切，分工合作，我思虑未周，不敢轻拟，统候大家筹议吧。
