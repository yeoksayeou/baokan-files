Xinhua News Agency report: The three-day Indian Conference for Peace and Disarmament closed on the 29th.

The conference passed ten resolutions. In a declaration on disarmament unanimously adopted, the conference called on the people to be vigilant against forces desperately trying to intensify the Cold War and prevent further progress on the road to peace. The declaration said, "The will and united action of the people can ensure the victory of the cause of disarmament."

The conference passed a resolution calling on all political parties and people's organizations in India to hold a "Disarmament Fortnight" from May 1st to 15th.

The resolution on national independence passed by the conference said, "The conference believes that the continued existence of colonialism and imperialism constitutes a threat to the freedom of all peoples and world peace, and guarantees that the conference will do its utmost to ensure the early elimination of this threat." The resolution expressed full support for "the struggle for national independence of the peoples still under colonial rule." The resolution said, "There will be no lasting peace if the inherent right of peoples to freedom of self-determination is not recognized." The conference fully supports the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria's demand for "the implementation of the principle of self-determination."

Another resolution passed by the conference called for an immediate ban on nuclear test explosions and the removal of all foreign bases for the use of nuclear weapons and missiles.

The conference passed a resolution welcoming a summit conference, calling on the leaders of the countries participating in the summit conference to "do their utmost to ensure that their talks will lead as soon as possible to a preliminary agreement to achieve the ultimate goal of comprehensive, universal, and supervised disarmament."

In a resolution, the conference called on parliamentarians of all countries to create "public opinion conducive to the early conclusion of agreements on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons and their testing." The conference suggested holding a world parliamentarians' conference for disarmament at a mutually agreed appropriate location at the end of this year.

When the Deputy Speaker of the Indian People's院, 胡卡姆·辛格, addressed the plenary session this morning, he strongly condemned the brutal racial repression in South Africa.

Williams of the National Council of Churches in India strongly criticized Eisenhower's statement that the United States believed the period for stopping nuclear tests had come to an end. He said, "We must expose the actions of the enemies of peace and disarmament."

When Indian parliamentarian Dr. 阿努普·辛格 spoke on the resolution on national independence, he said that the Algerian war should be considered a war of national liberation. He condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany for helping France fight in Algeria as "accomplices in crimes."

布拉甘扎夫人 demanded the liberation of Goa from India. She said that the Portuguese colonialists occupying Goa are supported by the reactionary forces of the United States and Britain. Some foreign observers also spoke at the closing session. In their speeches, they reiterated their efforts to oppose the forces of war and aggression and demanded vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialism.

    坚决支持争取民族独立斗争
    要求立即禁止核武器试验早日实现普遍裁军
    据新华社讯　历时三天的印度争取和平和裁军会议已在29日闭幕。
    会议通过了十项决议。会议在一致通过的关于裁军问题的宣言中，号召人民警惕正在拼命企图加剧冷战和阻止在和平道路上取得进一步进展的势力。宣言说，“人民的意志和联合行动可以确保裁军事业取得胜利。”
    会议通过决议，要求印度一切政党和人民团体从5月1日起到15日举行“裁军双周”。
    会议通过的关于民族独立的决议说，“会议认为，殖民主义和帝国主义的继续存在构成了对各国人民的自由和世界和平的威胁，并且保证，会议将尽力确保早日消灭这种威胁。”决议表示完全支持“仍受到殖民地统治的各国人民争取民族独立的斗争”。决议说，“如果不承认人民对于自决自由的固有的权利，那末决不会有任何持久的和平。”会议完全支持阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府关于“实行自决原则”的要求。
    会议通过的另一项决议要求立即禁止核试验爆炸，撤除使用核武器和导弹的一切外国基地。
    会议通过决议，表示欢迎最高级会议，要求参加最高级会议的各国领导人“尽他们最大的力量保证他们的会谈将尽早导致初步协议，以实现全面、普遍、有监督的裁军这一最终目标。”
    会议在决议中号召各国议员创造“有利于早日达成裁军和禁止核武器及其试验的协议的公众舆论”。会议建议在今年年底在得到一致同意的适当地点召开世界议员争取裁军大会。
    印度人民院副议长胡卡姆·辛格在今天上午的全体会议上致词时，强烈谴责南非的残酷的种族镇压。
    印度全国教会联合会的威廉斯强烈指责艾森豪威尔所谓美国认为停止核试验的时期已告结束的说法。他说，“我们必须揭露和平和裁军的敌人的行动。”
    印度议员阿努普·辛格博士就关于民族独立的决议发言时说，阿尔及利亚战争应该被认为是民族解放战争。他谴责帮助法国在阿尔及利亚作战的美英和西德等北大西洋公约组织盟国是“罪行的同谋犯”。
    布拉甘扎夫人要求解放印度的果阿。她说，占领果阿的葡萄牙殖民主义者是受到美英反动势力的支持的。在闭幕会上讲话的还有一些外国观察员。他们在发言中重申他们将努力反对战争侵略势力，并且要求对帝国主义的阴谋保持警惕。
