Hangjin Banner Achieves "100 Lambs per 100 Ewes" in Winter Lambing
Aohan Banner Sheep Breeding Farm Sets New Record for High Sheep Yield

(Our dispatch) The herdsmen of Hangjin Banner, Inner Mongolia, who first initiated the "100 Lambs per 100 Ewes" campaign in animal husbandry production, have achieved a great harvest in the winter lambing season through hard work, and the goal of producing 100 lambs per 100 ewes has been preliminarily realized. As of mid-March, more than 167,500 ewes across the banner had given birth to and raised 183,000 lambs, an average of 109 lambs raised per 100 ewes of breeding age.

Following the victory of winter lambing, spring lambing has now begun. The people of all ethnic groups in the banner are full of joy, guarding the herds day and night, assisting with the spring lambing. During the spring lambing season, more than 146,000 ewes pregnant for the first time and 109,900 ewes bred during the winter hot mating season will give birth successively. In the next two months or so, the herdsmen of Hangjin Banner will also be able to assist in the birth and raising of more than 233,000 lambs. Adding the 183,000 lambs already raised, the 330,000 ewes of breeding age in the banner will produce an average of more than 120 lambs raised per 100 ewes this year.

(Our dispatch) The staff of the Aohan Banner Sheep Breeding Farm in Inner Mongolia, who first created a new record for multiple lambs per ewe, are making persistent efforts and advancing victoriously. Among a batch of ewes mated last year, 531 ewes have already given birth to lambs, raising a total of 771 lambs, a breeding survival rate of 145%, creating a high-yield record for sheep on a "large scale." Among them, one ewe gave birth to five lambs, three ewes gave birth to four lambs, ten ewes gave birth to three lambs, and ewes giving birth to twins accounted for more than 50% of the lambing ewes.

The Aohan Banner Sheep Farm has been using the method of injecting pregnant mare serum into ewes to increase the lambing rate for four years. In these four years, the sheep breeding rate has increased year by year. Last year, the 1,961 ewes injected with pregnant mare serum at the farm had a breeding survival rate of 127.7%. This year, the breeding survival rate of ewes that have already given birth has increased by 17.5% compared to last year.

In the process of creating this high-yield record, the staff of the Aohan Banner Sheep Farm prominently grasped three main links: the feeding management of ewes in the late stages of pregnancy and during the pre-partum period, and the care of newborn lambs. In the late stages of pregnancy and during the pre-partum period, ewes are prone to losing weight due to rapid fetal development, which can lead to abortions or congenital deficiencies in the fetus and weakness in newborn lambs. Therefore, the staff of the Aohan Banner Sheep Farm first implemented group-based and graded feeding management for ewes in the late stages of pregnancy and during the pre-partum period, supplemented with grass and feed to increase nutrition, preventing abortions. In terms of grazing, grazing measures such as grazing far away with light pregnancies, grazing nearby with heavy pregnancies, not drinking cold water, and walking slowly and frequently were adopted to ensure safe delivery for the ewes. As soon as the lambs are born, umbilical cord disinfection is carried out, and the lambs are assisted in consuming colostrum; if weak lambs are found, they are immediately given warm water baths to enhance their body temperature and resistance to cold. In this way, every lamb born lives, and every lamb that lives grows strong. (Mi Jidedaoerji)

    杭锦旗冬季接羔实现“百母百仔”
    敖汉旗绵羊繁殖场再创绵羊高产纪录
    本报讯　首倡畜牧业生产“百母百仔”运动的内蒙古杭锦旗牧民，经过辛勤劳动，在冬羔季节获得大丰收，百母产百仔的努力目标已经初步胜利实现。截至3月中旬，全旗十六万七千五百多头母畜已经接产成活十八万三千头幼畜，平均每百头适龄母畜繁殖成活一百零九头仔畜。
    紧接着冬季接羔的胜利，现在春季接羔又开始了。全旗各族牧民，正喜气洋洋，昼夜守卫着畜群，接产春羔。在春羔季节里，全旗还有十四万六千多头第一次受胎的母畜和十万九千九百多头冬季热配的母畜，要陆续产仔。在今后两个多月内，杭锦旗牧民还能接产保育二十三万三千多头仔畜，加上现已成活的十八万三千头幼畜，全旗三十三万头适龄母畜，今年平均每百头就能繁殖成活一百二十多头仔畜。
    本报讯　首创绵羊一胎多羔新纪录的内蒙古敖汉旗绵羊繁殖场职工，再接再厉，乘胜前进。去年配种的一批母羊中，现在已有五百三十一只母羊产羔，共保育成活七百七十一只，繁殖成活率达145％，创造了绵羊“大面积”高额丰产纪录。其中一胎五羔的一只，一胎四羔的三只，一胎三羔的十只，一胎双羔的占产羔母羊的50％以上。
    敖汉旗羊场采用给母羊注射妊娠马血清来提高产羔率的办法已有四年，在这四年中，绵羊的繁殖率年年增长。去年全场注射妊娠马血清的一千九百六十一只母羊，繁殖成活率达127.7％。今年，已经产羔的母羊繁殖成活率，又比去年提高了17.5％。
    敖汉旗羊场职工，在创造这个高产纪录过程中，突出地抓住了母羊怀孕末期、临产期的饲养管理和初生羔羊的护理等三个主要环节。怀孕末期和临产母羊，因胎儿发育快，很容易掉膘，引起流产或胎羔先天不足和初生羔虚弱现象。因此，敖汉旗羊场职工，首先对怀孕末期和临产母羊实行分群分等饲养，贴喂草料，增加营养，防止了流产。在放牧上，又采取了胎轻远放、胎重近放、不饮冷水、慢走勤走等放牧措施，让母羊安全分娩。羔羊一生下来，就要进行脐带消毒，辅助羔羊吃初奶；如果发现虚弱羊羔，立即实行温水沐浴，以增强体温抗寒。这样，就做到了生一只活一只，活一只壮一只。（密吉德道尔基）
