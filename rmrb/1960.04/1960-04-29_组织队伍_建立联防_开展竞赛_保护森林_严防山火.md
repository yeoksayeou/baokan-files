Xinhua News Agency Report: In order to prevent spring forest fires and protect forests, forest areas and mountainous areas across the country are carrying out mass forest fire prevention work.

Spring is a windy and dry season, prone to forest fires. Moreover, many regions are experiencing spring droughts this year, making fire prevention even more important. The leading authorities of the northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued instructions on strengthening spring forest fire prevention work as early as early and mid-March. All localities have improved forest fire prevention organizations and established command structures in accordance with the principle of "prevention first, active elimination." Since this spring, Heilongjiang Province has established more than 150 forest fire prevention command stations in key forest areas; more than 50 key forest counties in the province have organized basic fire prevention teams with a total of more than 2 million members. Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia and other provinces and regions have also strengthened forest fire prevention work this spring, due to the large-scale closure of mountains for afforestation and afforestation in recent years, and a large number of concentrated young forests have grown up. The southern provinces and regions have also made arrangements for forest fire prevention in forest areas and mountainous areas. In early March, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi held a cooperation meeting on forest fire prevention in 104 counties in the border areas in Changsha City, exchanged experiences, and established a joint defense organization. Forest area counties in Yunnan Province launched a joint inspection of forest fire prevention, which further promoted spring forest fire prevention work in forest areas.

All forest areas have strengthened the management of personnel entering the mountains, promptly established various forest fire prevention systems, formulated various fire prevention covenants, and launched forest fire prevention competitions. Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and other provinces and regions have set up fire prevention posts and inspection stations at major road entrances in forest areas to inspect and publicize personnel entering the forest. Mudanjiang, Hejiang and other regions in Heilongjiang Province have also organized more than 1,000 voluntary forest rangers to cooperate with forestry departments to strengthen forest area patrols; various forest areas in this province have universally mobilized the masses to formulate forest fire prevention covenants, and many commune and county forest farms and forest area construction sites have also launched competitions for no forest fires.

In the course of spring forest fire prevention work, various localities actively mobilize the masses to carry out basic forest fire prevention construction. All forest areas have opened up forest fire prevention lines and built watchtowers. Remote forest areas have also installed modern telecommunications equipment on the watchtowers. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions also have chemical fire extinguishing stations in forest areas, and many regions have promoted forest fire risk weather forecasting.

    保护森林  严防山火
    据新华社讯　为了防止春季山火，保护森林，各地林区、山区正在开展群众性的护林防火工作。
    春天是风多干燥的季节，容易发生山火。加以今年许多地区春旱，防火更加重要。东北各省和内蒙古自治区的领导机关早在3月上、中旬就先后发出了关于加强春季护林防火工作的指示。各地都根据“预防为主，积极消灭”的方针，健全了护林防火组织，成立指挥机构。黑龙江省今春以来在重点林区建立了护林防火指挥站一百五十多处；全省五十多个林区重点县都组织了基干防火队，队员共达二百多万人。河南、河北、山西、山东、甘肃、陕西、宁夏等省、区，由于几年来大规模的封山育林和造林，已有大量成片集中的幼林成长起来，今春也加强了护林防火工作。南方各省、区，也对林区、山区的护林防火作了布置。3月上旬，湖南、湖北、贵州、四川、广东、广西六省区，在长沙市召开了交界地区一百零四个县的护林防火协作会议，交流了经验，建立了联防组织。云南省林区各县开展了护林防火联合大检查，进一步推动了林区春季护林防火工作。
    各林区都加强了入山人员的管理工作，及时建立了各种护林防火制度，订立各种防火公约，开展护林防火竞赛。内蒙古、黑龙江等省、区，在林区的主要路口设立了防火哨和检查站，对入林人员进行检查和宣传。黑龙江省牡丹江、合江等地区还组织了一千多名义务护林员，配合林业部门加强林区巡逻；这个省各林区普遍发动群众，订立护林防火公约，很多社县林场和林区工地还开展了无森林火灾的竞赛。
    各地开展春季护林防火工作中，积极发动群众进行护林防火基本建设。各林区都开辟森林防火线，修建了望台，偏远林区在了望台上还安装有近代化的电讯设备。黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等省、区在林区内还设有化学灭火站，许多地区推行了森林火灾危险天气预报工作。（附图片）
