Cultivating Children to Be Successors to the Cause of Communism
Delegate Tian Xiujuan Discusses Preschool Children's Care and Education

It is estimated that there are 150 million children under the age of seven in our country. They are the successors to our communist cause. This requires that from the time they are seedlings, they can regularly exercise and strengthen their physique, and from an early age develop the noble morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property; and develop soundly in both body and mind.

Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully support the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the issue of further developing and improving the care and education of preschool children.

Children growing up in the great Mao Zedong era are glorious and happy, and have received great care from the Party and the country. With the victory of the socialist revolution and the development of socialist construction, the cause of children's care and education has also greatly developed. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great victory of the people's communes, the cause of children's care and education in our country has developed on a large scale and at an unprecedented speed, widely and universally. After more than a year of rectification and consolidation, the quality has also been greatly improved. Satisfactory advanced childcare organizations have emerged everywhere, and childcare workers wholeheartedly serve the children, striving to "be better than mothers," so that the children are well-fed, well-played, well-slept, and healthy in collective education; can sing and dance, are polite, pay attention to hygiene, love the collective, love labor, and respect and love their parents even more. Everywhere is filled with a new situation of children's happiness, parents' satisfaction, social praise, and childcare workers' joy.

Today, as we are about to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, build socialism at high speed, and actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism in the future, continuing to implement the policy of children's care and education with social education as the main focus, and further developing and improving the cause of preschool children's care and education, is a major task in our construction.

At present, it is estimated that there are about 150 million children under the age of seven in our country. These 150 million children are the successors to our communist cause. We hope that they will all have healthy bodies, a high degree of communist consciousness, high communist moral qualities, and a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, and become builders and defenders of the communist cause, and heroes who transform nature and conquer the universe. This requires that from the time they are seedlings, they can regularly exercise and strengthen their physique, and from an early age develop the noble morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property; and develop soundly in both body and mind.

At the same time, according to the needs of the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the urgent demands of the vast number of women, the task of further developing and improving the cause of children's care and education has been put forward. As everyone already knows, women in rural areas of our country have become a main force in agricultural production; the number of female workers in factories and mines has increased from 600,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 8 million now, and a large number of urban housewives have participated in production and are already the main force in neighborhood industries. This year, in the upsurge of comprehensively organizing production and comprehensively organizing life in various cities, a large number of women have taken up social labor positions. The vast majority of these women are young and middle-aged, and most of them have children. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem of childcare and education for them, so that they can concentrate on labor, engage in political, cultural, and technical learning, and achieve a double leap forward in production and learning like men, and gradually climb the peak of scientific culture, to make greater contributions to socialist construction.

Now, the rural people's communes have been further consolidated and developed, and the mass movement of running people's communes in cities across the country on a large scale, comprehensively organizing production, and comprehensively organizing life has appeared in a new climax with even greater scale and magnificence. Under this excellent situation, the urgent demand to further implement the policy of focusing on social education and comprehensively organizing preschool children has been put forward, and with the development of the national economy and culture, there is also a further improvement and development of the material basis for childcare organizations. At present, under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, various localities are promoting the cause of childcare and education throughout the country in accordance with the spirit of combining popularization and improvement. The state runs it, the communes run it, the streets run it, factories and enterprises run it, government offices run it, schools run it; one unit runs it, several units jointly run it, in short, everyone works together to run it, and strives to organize all preschool children in stages and batches as soon as possible. In terms of the scale and form of the events, they are not only based on reality, but also have a long-term vision, and according to specific conditions and needs, various forms such as full boarding, day care, night care, half-day care, and temporary care are carried out simultaneously, combining large, medium, and small sizes. Now, many regions are also making the childcare institutions networked and complete in the spirit of continuous revolution. For example, some areas in Sichuan, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces have formed an organic whole of maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens, and taken on all the responsibilities of maternal and child health care and preschool children's education; other areas have implemented the division of labor and specialization, centralized and unified management of the services of nurseries and kindergartens, and established children's nutrition canteens, children's isolation convalescent homes, toy factories, children's bathrooms, children's barbershops, children's clothing sewing and washing shops, etc. In this way, the social division of labor is more reasonable, management is more convenient, and it has also played a great role in improving the quality of childcare work. These new things are growing and developing in large numbers and need support from all sides and vigorous promotion to make them more perfect and play a greater role. In the case of the great development and great improvement of the childcare cause in our country, improving the quality of childcare workers has become an extremely important specific task. It is even more necessary for us to have lofty ambitions and set great goals to raise childcare workers to a qualified level that is both red and expert in a not too long period. That is to say, gradually make all caregivers have the level of kindergarten teachers and all nurses have the level of pediatric nurses. Why? Because with the level of graduation from kindergarten teacher, it is conducive to cultivating the communist ideology of preschool children, giving them scientific education, and preparing them for school; with the level of pediatric nurse, the health care work of childcare organizations can be raised to the due level. Especially the childcare work of children under the age of three should become the focus of preschool children's care and education, they are the youngest of the seedlings and need more careful care, and the nurses must have the level of pediatric nurses to be competent. Therefore, we are never satisfied with having already organized, having already taken initial shape, and already having preliminary childcare knowledge; we must have a long-term vision and constantly strive to improve, so that the childcare cause can be done better and constantly move forward. This requires all relevant parties to take active actions, promote the spirit of communist cooperation, and formulate plans for training work based on the different levels of existing childcare workers. In the training work, it is also necessary to implement the policy of walking on two legs. At present, primary, secondary, and senior normal schools for kindergarten teachers and nursing schools for pediatric nurses have been established and are being developed in various localities to train specialized talents of different levels. This long-term plan is very necessary. We believe that through the joint efforts of all relevant parties, we will be able to run these schools more and better and become a base for continuously training childcare workers. At the same time, experience has proved that it is also an important and indispensable leg to cultivate childcare workers through various tutoring methods, learning while working, professional training, short-term rotation training, spare-time learning, as well as visits, evaluations, performances, and competitions. Since 1958, these two legs have become more and more closely combined in running schools and teaching, which makes us full of confidence. In the future, we will better adhere to walking on two legs and make a qualified childcare team grow and grow as soon as possible.

Popularization and improvement are interrelated and are two aspects of a problem, not isolated. Chairman Mao taught us to use both hands to grasp work. We realize that this is no exception in the field of children's care and education. We must grasp popularization with one hand and improvement with the other; popularize while improving; constantly popularize and constantly improve. At the same time, we must grasp the current popularization and improvement with one hand and develop towards a higher scientific level in the future. Training childcare workers on two legs is also an important and specific task for both the present and the future.

To make the cause of children's care and education greatly developed and greatly improved, in the final analysis, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command in the cause of care and education, resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely serve production, serve the masses, and serve proletarian politics, while adhering to the mass line, relying on the strength of the masses themselves, using the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements, adapting to local conditions, starting from scratch, from small to large, from low-level to high-level, from simple to complete, and always implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the cause. This is the only correct way to develop the cause of care and education in a faster, better, and more economical way. We have been and must continue to move forward along this road in the future.

We are very happy to see that the cause of children's care and education has become a noble cause in the minds of the people of our country. First of all, it is reflected in the love and high sense of responsibility of childcare workers and the communist spirit. There are currently about 6 million childcare workers in our country. The vast majority of them are loyal, responsible, and striving for progress. They overcame various difficulties, took on the work of raising children, gave convenience to parents, left difficulties to themselves, worked day and night to serve the children, and highly developed the communist spirit of maternal love. At present, childcare workers in urban and rural areas across the country, in order to do more and better work, have launched a patriotic health campaign in childcare organizations, and are making unremitting efforts for the health and disease prevention of children, and are fighting to eliminate pests and diseases. At the same time, they have also widely carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, which have greatly saved labor, saved time, and improved labor efficiency. It has also greatly reduced the labor intensity of childcare workers, giving them time to study and rest, and further achieved a combination of work and rest. At present, this movement is still developing unevenly in the cause of care and education, and it needs to continue to work hard to further deepen the movement. Of course, in the movement, there will inevitably be struggles between advanced and conservative ideas, and between the idea of continuous revolution and the idea of being satisfied with the status quo. We hope that all childcare workers can stand at the forefront of continuous revolution, be promoters, and be innovators, so that the cause of care and education can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. The care, support, and love of parents, especially mothers, for the cause of care and education have become an important guarantee for the development and improvement of the cause of care and education.

The cause of children's care and education has received great care and support from our Party and country, and has been valued by all sectors of society. Because the cause of care and education is both a production cause and a life welfare cause; both an education cause and a cultural health care cause; it is both related to the current socialist construction and to the future communist cause; it is both beneficial to children and to adults, especially women. Therefore, all relevant parties, under the unified leadership of the Party, have promoted the communist spirit, vigorously carried out cooperation, and jointly run this cause well. Recently, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education are studying and formulating plans for training childcare workers, and factories, mines, enterprises, urban and rural people's communes, government offices, organizations, and schools are paying attention to developing and improving childcare organizations. Since the beginning of this year, especially in the past month, a new situation of great development and great improvement has emerged in the cause of care and education. We believe that this situation will continue to expand and develop in depth.

We hope that all childcare workers and all comrades and mothers engaged in work related to preschool children must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's writings, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the three red banners of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, and strive to cultivate our country's children into successors to the communist cause.

    把儿童培养成为共产主义的接班人
    田秀涓代表谈学前儿童的保教工作
    我国七岁以下的儿童估计有一亿五千万。他们是我们共产主义事业的接班人。这就需要从他们还是幼苗的时候起，就能经常地锻炼身体，增强体质，从小就养成爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的崇高道德；在身心两个方面，都得到健全的发展。主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告。现在仅就有关进一步发展和提高学前儿童的保教工作问题，发表一点意见。
    生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的儿童是光荣幸福的，受到了党和国家极大的关怀。随着社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的发展，儿童保教事业也有了巨大的发展。特别自1958年以来，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，我国儿童的保教事业更以空前的规模和速度，大量地普遍地发展起来。经过一年多来的整顿巩固，在质量上也有了很大的提高。到处出现了令人满意的先进的托幼组织，保教人员全心全意为儿童服务，争取“阿姨赛妈妈”，使孩子们在集体教养中，吃得好、玩得好、睡得好、身体好，能歌会舞、懂礼貌、讲卫生、热爱集体、热爱劳动，对父母更尊重、更亲爱。到处充满着孩子高兴、家长满意、社会称赞、保教人员心情舒畅的新局面。
    在今天，当我们要把社会主义革命进行到底，高速度地建成社会主义，并为将来向共产主义过渡积极准备条件的伟大历史任务面前，继续贯彻执行以社会教育为主的儿童保教工作的方针，进一步大发展，大提高学前儿童保教事业，是我们建设中的一项重大任务。
    当前，我国七岁以下儿童据估计约有一亿五千万。这一亿五千万孩子，是我们共产主义事业的接班人。我们希望他们都具有健康的体魄，都有高度的共产主义觉悟、高度的共产主义道德品质、高度的文化科学知识，成为共产主义事业的建设者和保卫者，成为改造自然、征服宇宙的英雄。这就需要从他们还是幼苗的时候起，就能经常地锻炼身体，增强体质，从小就养成爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的崇高道德；在身心两方面，都得到健全的发展。
    同时，根据当前工农业生产持续大跃进的需要和广大妇女的迫切要求，提出了儿童保教事业进一步大发展、大提高的任务。正如大家都已经知道的，我国农村妇女已经成为农业生产上的一支主力军；厂矿、企业的女职工由解放初期的六十万已发展到现在的八百多万人，大批的城市家庭妇女参加了生产，已经是街办工业的主要力量。今年，在各城市全面组织生产、全面组织生活的高潮中，又有大批的妇女走上了社会劳动岗位。这些妇女绝大多数是青壮年，绝大部分都有孩子。因此必须为她们解决孩子的保育和教育的问题，才能使她们集中精力从事劳动，从事政治、文化、技术的学习，和男子同样得到生产学习双跃进，逐步地攀登科学文化高峰，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    现在，农村人民公社已有了进一步的巩固和发展，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，全面组织生产，全面组织生活的群众运动更加规模壮阔地出现了新的高潮。在这种大好形势下，提出了进一步贯彻执行以社会教育为主的方针，全面组织学前儿童的迫切要求，而且随着国民经济、文化的发展，又有了进一步提高和发展托儿组织的物质基础。当前各地根据普及与提高相结合的精神，在中国共产党各级党委的领导下，正在全国范围内促进保教事业。国家办、公社办、街道办、工厂企业办、机关办、学校办；一个单位办，几个单位联合办，总之，大家动手办，为分期分批地、尽快地把所有学前儿童组织起来而努力。在举办的规模和形式上，既从实际出发，又高瞻远瞩，根据具体情况和需要，有全托、日托、夜托、半日托、临时托等各种形式同时并举，大、中、小型结合。现在不少地区还本着不断革命的精神，使保教机构成网成套。如四川、河南、黑龙江等省的有些地区，把妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园组成一个整体，把妇幼保健，学前儿童教养的全部责任担当起来；还有些地区把托儿所幼儿园的服务工作实行分工分业集中统一管理，成立了儿童营养食堂，儿童隔离休养所，玩具工厂，儿童浴室，儿童理发室，童装缝洗店等。这样，使社会分工更加合理，管理更加方便，对提高保教工作质量也起了很大的作用。这些新事物已在大量生长和发展，正需要各方面的支持和大力推广，使它更加完善、发挥更大的作用。在我国保教事业大发展、大提高的情况下，提高保教工作人员的质量就成为一项极其重要的具体任务。更需要我们树雄心、立大志，在一个不太长的时期内，把保教人员提高到又红又专的合格的水平。就是说，逐步使所有的教养员都能够具有幼师水平、所有的保育员都能够具有保育护士水平。为什么呢？因为有了幼师毕业的水平，就有利于培养学前儿童的共产主义思想，给以科学的教育，做好入学前的准备；有了保育护士的水平，就能把托幼组织的卫生保健工作，提高到应有的水平。尤其是三岁以下儿童的保育工作，更应该成为学前儿童保教工作的重点，他们是幼苗当中最幼小的，需要更多的细致的照管，保育员必须具有保育护士水平，才能胜任。因此我们决不满足已经组织起来，已经初具规模，已经有初步的保教常识；我们一定要高瞻远瞩，不断地争取提高，使保教事业办得更好，不断前进。这就需要各有关方面积极行动起来，发扬共产主义协作精神，根据现有保教人员的不同水平，制订培训工作的规划。在培训工作中，也要贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。现在各地已经举办和正在发展初、中、高级幼儿师范学校和保育护士学校，训练不同程度的专门人才，这种长远打算，是非常必要的。我们相信，经过各有关方面的共同努力，一定能把这些学校办得更多、更好，成为源源不断地培养保教人员的基地。同时经验证明：通过各种辅导办法边作、边学，业务进修、短期轮训、业余学习，以及参观评比，表演竞赛等方式，也是培养保教人员的重要的必不可少的一条腿。1958年以来，这两条腿在办学和教学上已经结合得越来越紧，越来越好，使我们充满着信心，今后更好地坚持两条腿走路，尽快地使一支合格的保教工作队伍成长壮大起来。
    普及和提高是相互联系的，是一个问题的两个方面，不是孤立的。毛主席教导我们用两手抓工作。我们体会到在儿童保教工作方面也不例外。我们要一手抓普及，一手抓提高；边普及，边提高；不断普及，不断提高。同时一手抓当前的普及与提高，一手抓将来向更高的科学水平发展。两条腿走路培训保教人员也正是既为了当前，也为了明天的一项重要的具体工作。
    要使儿童保教事业大发展，大提高，归根到底需要在保教事业中坚持政治挂帅，坚决听党和毛主席的话，坚决为生产服务，为群众服务，为无产阶级政治服务，同时坚持群众路线，依靠群众自己的力量，用大搞群众运动的办法，因时因地制宜，从无到有，从小到大，由低级到高级，由简单到完备，并且始终要贯彻勤俭办事业的精神。这是唯一正确的、多快好省地发展保教事业的道路。我们过去是、今后也一定要沿着这条道路前进。
    我们很高兴地看到，儿童保教事业，在我国人民的心目中，已成为一种崇高的事业。首先表现在保教人员对这个事业的热爱和高度负责的共产主义精神。我国现有保教人员约六百多万。其中绝大部分是忠心耿耿、积极负责、力争上游的。她们克服了各种困难，把教养孩子的工作承担起来，把方便送给家长，把困难留给自己，废寝忘食地为孩子服务，高度发扬了共产主义的母爱精神。当前，全国城乡的保教工作者，为了把工作做得更多、更好，在托幼组织中，已经热火朝天地展开了爱国卫生运动，正在为孩子们的健康、疾病预防作不懈的努力，正在为除害灭病而奋斗。同时还广泛地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，大大节约了劳力，节省了时间，提高了劳动效率。也大大减轻了保教工作人员的劳动强度，使她们有时间学习和得到休息，进一步做到了劳逸结合。目前，这项运动在保教事业中还发展得不平衡，需要继续努力，使运动进一步深入地开展。当然在运动中，必然会遇到先进与保守思想之间的斗争，不断革命的思想与满足现状的思想之间的斗争。我们希望所有的保教工作者，都能站在不断革命的最前列，当促进派，当革新派，使保教事业办得更多、更快、更好、更省。而家长们，尤其是母亲们对保教事业的关心、支持和爱护，又成为保教事业发展和提高的一个重要保证。
    儿童保教事业，已经得到我们党和国家的极大关怀和支持，又得到社会各方面的重视。由于保教事业既是生产事业，又是生活福利事业；既是教育事业，又是文化卫生保健事业，既关系当前的社会主义建设，又关系到将来的共产主义事业，既有利于儿童，又有利于成人，尤其是妇女。因此各个有关方面都在党的统一领导下，发扬了共产主义精神，大搞协作，共同来把这个事业办好。最近卫生部和教育部都在研究和制定培训保教人员的规划，各厂矿企业、城乡人民公社、各机关、团体、学校，都在注意发展和提高托儿组织。今年以来，尤其是最近一个月以来，保教事业方面已出现了大发展、大提高的新局面，我们相信，这种情况，还会继续扩大和深入发展。
    我们希望，全体保教工作人员和一切从事有关学前儿童工作的同志们、妈妈们，一定要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，为把我国的儿童培养成为共产主义接班人而努力奋斗。
