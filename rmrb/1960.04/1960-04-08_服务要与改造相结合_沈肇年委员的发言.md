Service Must Be Combined with Transformation
Speech by Committee Member Shen Zhaonian

Chairman, fellow committee members:

On March 29th of this year, the Third National Committee of the CPPCC held its Second Session. I listened to the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong on the Standing Committee's work and his opinions on future work, which I fully agree with. Furthermore, on the 30th, I attended the opening of the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress and listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, which I wholeheartedly support. I would like to talk about:

Two examples of combining service with transformation:

1. Compiling concise gazetteers for counties and cities: I work at the Hubei Research Institute of Culture and History, mainly participating in the review work of the Fang Zhi (Local Chronicles) Committee in compiling concise gazetteers for various counties and cities. This work began in 1957, and the previous compilation situation was briefly introduced to the conference at the opening of the Third National Committee’s First Session last April. At that time, the concise gazetteers of several counties had already been published. To determine whether they met local needs, symposiums were held with relevant counties and provincial-level units to solicit opinions. At the same time, we also conducted a work summary and examined the content of the concise gazetteers, discovering some problems. The main problems were low quality, insufficient ideological content, and outdated compilation methods that had not broken away from the scope of the old gazetteers. For example, some people said, "A gazetteer is history," "A new gazetteer is a continuation of the old," "Compiling a gazetteer is doing history; it can only record facts, not political propaganda," and a series of similar thoughts, limited by the "detailed interview outline" and the issue of periodization, both of which were inherited from the old gazetteers.

In order to improve the above shortcomings and raise ideological awareness, a systematic professional study was organized in the second half of 1959, using the published concise gazetteers as study material. Through study, experience was summarized, lessons were learned, and all compilers' ideological understanding was improved to a certain extent. They also gained certain benefits in terms of political ideology. Most of the compilers were older, but they were able to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism during the study, and they were also able to break away from sentimentality, expose problems, face facts, and discuss matters on their merits. Therefore, many older gentlemen unanimously believed that through study, not only was their professional level improved, but also their ideology was greatly advanced. Specifically, in terms of interviewers, through this study, they also recognized the shortcomings of "only collecting and not interviewing" when going to the counties in the past.

After the study ended, experiences were immediately summarized, and based on the development of the situation and combined with specific conditions, the items and content of the concise gazetteer were re-examined, the outline was revised, and three working groups were formed. They went to three counties and cities of different types – Hong'an, Jiangling, and Huangshi – to engage in practical work, jointly collect and compile, and collectively synthesize. The results basically met the purpose and requirements of the concise gazetteer and will soon be compiled into a book, sent to the leaders of various counties and cities for review and approval, and then submitted for printing.

Regarding this rectification work, the ideological understanding that putting politics in command – that is, the leadership of the Party – is the main guarantee for promoting all work and completing all tasks, that is, adhering to mobilizing positive factors and correctly implementing the policy of "combining service with transformation" in the work, is why it was possible to achieve better results.

I myself, in this rectification work, also accepted the leadership of the Party ideologically without exception. Through work practice, I improved my political and ideological understanding and strived for transformation together with the compilers, thus establishing a sense of service.

This is the first example I want to introduce.

2. Reviewing and Compiling the "Hubei Literature Collection": Last April, when the Third National Committee held its First Session, Vice Chairman Dong instructed us on a local task: a "Hubei Literature Collection" compiled by fourteen elderly people from Hubei living in Beijing over a long period of twenty-five years (1930-1955). The original manuscript was divided into two parts, the main collection and the appendix. The main collection included writings from the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and modern periods, and the appendix included modern writings, including more than seven thousand five hundred articles by more than two thousand seven hundred Hubei people from five eras. Including the beginning and end of the compilation, prefaces, explanatory notes, name directories, author biographies, and name and county name indexes, it was divided into six hundred and eighty-nine volumes (books), totaling approximately nine million words. Now, the Party and government of our province have handed it over to the Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History for preparation for publication, and it must be reviewed and reorganized. Therefore, the Hubei Literature Collection Review and Compilation Committee was organized to oversee the matter, and six members were designated within the committee to undertake regular review and compilation tasks.

When we were reviewing and compiling, we based our work on the original compilers' principle of "preserving people through their writings and writings through their people," analyzed the presence and extent of the authors' and articles' popular nature, and followed the policy of "preserving materials" and "making the past serve the present" in dealing with cultural heritage—historical cultural achievements—as the basic standard for deleting or retaining content, but we did not use new standards to measure old articles, so more were retained and fewer were deleted, only removing the most egregious content.

Our methods and approaches to reviewing and compiling were to strive to implement the spirit of collectivism. The review and compilation process involved individual initial reviews, mutual research, meeting discussions, and one person's complete re-reading, with final approval by the leadership. Our review and compilation group undertook the daily review and compilation work. After seven months of exploration, we have preliminarily completed the first volume, and after further sorting, it can be approved by the leadership and submitted for printing.

Under the leadership of the Party and illuminated by the socialist radiance, in these seven months of exploration, our study has been closely integrated with theory, current affairs, and professional work. In the process of discussing concrete issues with great debate, our understanding of various aspects has begun to improve, especially in terms of the Party's foreign affairs, ethnic, domestic, and cultural education policies. Although this review and compilation work is becoming more and more in-depth, our enthusiasm is growing even greater, which shows that the Party's policy of combining service with transformation is very correct and powerful.

This is the second example I want to introduce.

Last autumn, the experience exchange conference of the Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committees of the Kuomintang was held in Hankou. Minister Hu Jinkui said at the meeting: "Service is the foundation of transformation, and transformation is the guarantee of service. Good service does not necessarily mean good transformation, but good transformation certainly means good service." I have been constantly bearing these words in mind.

### 服务要与改造相结合  沈肇年委员的发言

专栏：

    服务要与改造相结合
    沈肇年委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    本年3月29日，本会第三届第二次会议开幕，我听了陈叔通副主席所作的常务委员会的工作报告和对今后工作的意见，我是极端赞同的。又30日列席全国人民代表大会第二次会议开幕，听到李富春副总理报告，关于1960年国民经济计划草案，李先念副总理报告，关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案，我是竭诚拥护的。我想谈谈：
    服务与改造相结合的两个事例：
    一、纂修各县市简志：我在湖北文史馆服务，主要是参加方志委员会编纂各县市简志的审查工作，自1957年开始，至上年4月本会开第三届第一次会议时，所有过去编纂情况，曾经向大会作了简略介绍。当时已经出版了几个县的简志，是否适合地方需要，经召开有关各县及省直属有关单位的座谈会，征求意见。另方面我们同时又进行了工作总结，检查简志的内容，发现已编成的简志，存在着一些问题，主要是质量不高，思想性不够，编写的方法陈旧，没有脱离旧志的范畴。例如有人说：“志者史也”，“新志是旧志的延续”，“修志是搞历史，只能记载事实，不是政治宣传”等等一系列的思想看法，加以局限在“采访细目”和断代的问题上，而这两点又是从旧志沿袭而来的。
    为了改进以上的缺点，提高思想认识，在1959年下半年就组织了一次系统的业务学习，以已出版的简志作为学习内容，通过学习，总结经验，吸取教训，全体采编人员在思想认识上，都有了一定的提高，在政治思想上，也得到了一定的收获。又采编人员大部分都是年纪较老的，但是在学习中能够做到自我检查、互相批评，也能够破除情面，揭发问题、面对事实，就事论事，所以许多老先生一致认为通过学习，不但业务上有了提高，而且在思想上也大有进步。专就采访人员说，通过这次学习，从思想上也认识了过去下县采访，“只要不找，光采不访”的缺点。
    学习结束以后，又紧接着总结了经验，根据形势的发展，结合本身的具体条件，重新审定了简志的项目和内容，改订纲要，组成三个工作小组，分赴不同类型的红安、江陵、黄石市三个县市，接触实际，共同采编，集体综合，大体上符合了简志的目的和要求，即将整改成书，分送各县市领导审可，交还付印。
    关于这一整改工作，从思想上认识政治挂帅——即党的领导，是推动一切工作和完成一切任务的主要保证，也就是在工作中坚持调动积极因素，正确执行“服务与改造相结合”的方针政策，所以能够达成较好的任务。
    我个人在这一整改工作中，也毫不例外的从思想上接受党的领导，通过工作实践，提高政治思想认识，与采编同志一道争取改造，也就建立了服务的感情。
    这是我要介绍的第一事例。
    二、审编湖北文征：上年4月本会召开第三届第一次会议的时候，董副主席面示我们地方任务一件，以湖北省旅京十四个老人先后经过二十五年——1930——1955——的漫长时期编纂而成的湖北文征一部，原稿分正附二编，正编为元、明、清和近代文，附编为现代文，包括五个时代二千七百多位湖北人作的七千五百多篇文章，连纂辑始末、序言、凡例、人名目录、作者小传和人名县名索引，共分六百八十九卷（本），约有九百万字。现在我省党和政府交省文史馆准备出版，并须加以审定和重编，经组织了湖北文征审编委员会主持其事。并在委员中指定了六人为审编小组，担负经常审编任务。
    我们审编的时候，是以原编纂人所述的“凡所征文一本‘以人存文以文存人’之旨”为基础，分析作者和文章的人民性的有无、多少，遵照处理文化遗产——历史文化成果——“保存资料”“古为今用”的方针，作为删存的基本标准，但不是以新尺度来量旧文章，所以存者多而删者少，只去其太甚。
    我们审编的方式方法，是力求贯彻集体主义的精神。审编程序，通过个别初审，彼此研究，开会讨论和一人全部复看，最后领导核定来进行的。我们的审编小组，担任日常审编工作，经过七个月的摸索，已初步审编完成了第一卷，再加整理就可由领导核定付印。
    我们审编会在党的领导下和社会主义光辉照耀下，在这七个月的摸索中，我们的学习，以理论时事与业务紧密结合进行，在大争大辩地讨论具体问题中，对各方面的认识，开始有些提高，尤其在党的外交、民族、内政、文化教育各项方针政策方面有了进一步的联系。尽管这种审编工作越搞越深，而我们的干劲，却越来越大，这说明了党的服务与改造相结合的方针，是非常正确而有力的。
    这是我要介绍的第二个事例。
    去年秋季广东、广西、湖南、湖北四省民革经验交流大会，在汉口召开，胡金魁部长在会上讲话说：“服务是改造的基础，改造是服务的保证，服务好不等于改造好，改造好服务一定好，”这几句话，我是时刻体会在心的。
