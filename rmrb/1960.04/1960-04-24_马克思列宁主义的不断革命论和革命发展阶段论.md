    The Theory of Uninterrupted Revolution and the Stages of Revolutionary Development in Marxism-Leninism
    Chi Liaozhou
    The theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages are the world outlook of Marxist-Leninists, the foundation of Marxist-Leninist strategy and tactics, and the theoretical weapon of the working class struggle.
    Uninterrupted revolution is the soul of Marxism-Leninism. In the eyes of Marxist-Leninists, everything in the world is in constant motion, change, innovation, and development. Marx said, "The growth of productive forces, the destruction of social relations, and the formation of ideas are all constantly changing; only the abstraction of movement, i.e., 'undead death,' is stagnant." ("The Poverty of Philosophy") Engels said, "Dialectical philosophy regards everything and anything as bearing the inevitable mark of extinction; in its view, nothing is permanent except the process of constant coming into being and passing away, except the endless process of ascent from the lower to the higher." ("Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy") Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out, "Metabolism is a universal, eternally irresistible law of the universe. Depending on the nature and conditions of things themselves, a thing transforms into another thing through different forms of leaps, which is the process of metabolism." ("On Contradiction") In social life, this "metabolism" is the alternation of social revolutions, that is, uninterrupted revolution. Marxist-Leninists also believe that in the continuous process of movement, things have different stages of development, and these different stages of development should not be confused. Every thing has its qualitative specificity and relative qualitative stability. Only when the quantitative change of a thing reaches a certain degree will it cause a qualitative change, and will it transform from one thing to another. In this way, each process from quantitative change to qualitative change forms a stage, distinguishing it from the previous and next stages. At the same time, in the process of quantitative change of things, there are also partial qualitative changes, forming many small stages of qualitative change. This state of development of things, in social revolution, is the theory of revolutionary development stages. The theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages are a unity of opposites, which are both different and inseparable. Dialectics tells us that the change of things is absolute, stability is relative, the revolutionary aspect is absolute, and the conservative aspect is relative. Therefore, uninterrupted revolution is absolute, and the stage of revolution is relative. To be a Marxist, only by completely grasping this idea can one always stand at the forefront of the struggle.

    (I)
    The battle cry of the proletariat is: Uninterrupted Revolution
    The theory of uninterrupted revolution was put forward as early as 1850 in the famous "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League" written by Marx and Engels. At that time, Marx and Engels pointed out that the interests and tasks of the proletarians were "to make the revolution uninterrupted" and that "their battle cry should be: 'Uninterrupted Revolution'."

    Marx and Engels also initially combined the theory of uninterrupted revolution with the theory of revolutionary development stages. In a letter in 1894, Engels pointed out that the petty-bourgeois democratic revolution should not be confused with the socialist revolution. In the "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx clearly pointed out that "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other." This divides communism into two stages, socialism and communism, and regards socialism as a transitional revolutionary stage. It should be said that this is one of the most brilliant ideas combining the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages.

    After the death of Marx and Engels, Lenin defended and developed the theory of uninterrupted revolution. At that time, in the international workers' movement, the revisionists of the Second International distorted and abandoned the theory of uninterrupted revolution of Marx and Engels, asserting that there was a Great Wall, a gap of several decades, between the two stages of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the proletarian socialist revolution. Bernstein's "The movement is everything, the final aim is nothing" typically expressed their position of abandoning the final aim and betraying the socialist revolution. Lenin believed that Bernstein's popular saying demonstrated the essence of revisionism better than many lengthy arguments.

    In Russia, various opportunists also appeared, who either opposed the theory of uninterrupted revolution or opposed the theory of revolutionary development stages. In the high tide of the 1905 revolution, the opportunist strategy put forward by the Mensheviks' "Representative Conference" was to deny that the proletariat should lead the bourgeois revolution, to carry the democratic revolution to the end so as to transform the revolution into a socialist revolution without interruption.

    Lenin resolutely refuted the fallacy that there was a Great Wall between the bourgeois democratic revolution stage and the socialist revolution stage. He pointed out that other than the degree of preparedness of the proletariat and the degree of alliance between the proletariat and the poor peasants, any attempt to separate these two revolutions with other things and to build a Great Wall between them was to replace Marxism-Leninism with liberalism. Moreover, he further pointed out that the two stages of democratic revolution and socialist revolution are both different and related. "In a specific historical environment, the past and future components are intertwined, and the front and rear roads are interwoven... But this does not prevent us from logically and historically separating the major stages of the development process. We all believe that the bourgeois revolution and the socialist revolution are distinctly different, and we all unconditionally and firmly advocate that the two revolutions must be strictly distinguished. However, can we deny the fact that individual branch components of the previous and subsequent revolutions are historically intertwined? Were there not many socialist movements and attempts to strive for socialism during the era of European democratic revolutions? Are there not still many things of a democratic nature in Europe that will eventually be completed by the future socialist revolution?" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 9, p. 70) Therefore, Lenin pointed out that in the democratic revolution, the scope and content of the class struggle should be expanded as much as possible, until it includes not only all the tasks of the national democratic revolution in Russia at that time, but also the tasks of the socialist revolution in the future. He repeatedly emphasized, "We advocate uninterrupted revolution, we will never give up halfway." In the democratic revolution, "Never forget our socialist goals for a minute," "Never forget for a minute the new contradictions hidden in the bourgeois democratic movement, and never forget the new struggle."

    On the issue of transforming from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution, Lenin brilliantly developed Marxism. Based on the fact that the proletariat's strength had greatly developed, capitalism had become decadent, and the bourgeoisie was prone to compromise and betray in the democratic revolution, he emphasized that the proletariat must grasp the leadership in the democratic revolution. This is the fundamental difference between the imperialist era and the bourgeois democratic revolution during the rise of capitalism. He found the proletariat's allies in the two revolutions—the peasants, stipulated the class line and forms of dictatorship at different stages. He discovered the law of uneven development of capitalism, and put forward the theory that socialist revolution can be victorious in one country, fundamentally shattering the opportunists' theory of abolishing socialist revolution and all pessimistic ideas.

    The more thorough the previous revolution is carried out, the faster and smoother the subsequent revolution will be launched.
    On the issue of transforming from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution, Lenin pointed out that another key point is the thoroughness of the revolution. He said: "The more completely the democratic revolution is realized, the earlier, the more extensive, the purer, and the more resolute this new struggle (referring to the socialist revolution—author) will be launched." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 9, p. 115)

    On the issue of transforming from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution, Lenin particularly insisted on the principle of violent revolution of militant Marxists. As early as the first Russian revolution, he sarcastically mocked the Mensheviks' opportunist illusions, saying: "Poor Russia! It has been said that it always wears an old-fashioned hat that Europe has long abandoned. We don't have a parliament here yet, and even Buligin has not promised to establish a parliament, but parliament mania is very popular." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume edition, Vol. 1, p. 611) Indeed, Lenin had pointed out for a short period after the February Revolution that there was a possibility of peacefully seizing power through mass political struggle. Because at that time, there was a situation of two powers coexisting, and if the bourgeoisie could be forced to hand over all power to the Soviets, that would certainly be the best thing. However, after the bourgeoisie launched the counter-revolutionary July Incident, Lenin promptly pointed out that the possibility of peaceful development of the revolution was gone, and it was impossible to establish a proletarian dictatorship without violence. Therefore, in many of his works, he strongly opposed the Mensheviks' argument for carrying out the struggle through parliament. In "State and Revolution," he said: "The replacement of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) is impossible without a violent revolution." The experiences of the Russian October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution have fully proved the correctness of this truth.

    In "State and Revolution" and other works, Lenin pointed out that the transition from the lower stage of communism to the higher stage of communism is also a process of uninterrupted revolution. He analyzed the transitional nature of socialist society, pointing out that socialist society cannot completely get rid of the traditions or traces of capitalism in the economic, political, and ideological aspects. It is not a complete and mature communist society. It must transition to the higher stage of communism, to a complete and mature communism. Lenin said: "When we begin socialist transformation, we should clearly present to ourselves the ultimate goal of these transformations, that is, the goal of establishing a communist society." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 27, p. 114)

    Realizing communism is the ultimate goal of communists, and we must never forget this goal and must carry the revolution through to the end. However, in order to realize the communist social system in the future, it is necessary to go through some necessary stages, and it is impossible to "achieve it overnight." Marx said: "Even when a society has come upon the trail of the natural law of its development—and it is the ultimate aim of this work, to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society—it can neither clear by bold leaps, nor remove by legal enactments, the obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development."

    Based on this principle, Lenin fully developed and expanded the theory of revolutionary development stages. As early as 1905, in response to the Mensheviks' opportunist strategy, Lenin, in his book "Two Tactics," incisively analyzed the then social and economic development situation in Russia, the objects of the revolution, class relations, and other objective conditions, as well as the degree of awareness of the working class and peasants and other subjective conditions. He pointed out that the nature and task of the revolution at that time was a bourgeois democratic revolution rather than a socialist revolution. He said that carrying out a democratic revolution now "is not delaying the socialist revolution, but the only possible method, the only correct and possible path, that is, taking the first step towards socialism along the path of a democratic republic." Pointing out: "The populists and anarchists say that a country like Russia can avoid capitalist development and can jump out or skip over this capitalism through other paths without going through the path of class struggle on the basis and within the scope of capitalism." is a reactionary and absurd conclusion. ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 9, p. 33) Even after the February Revolution in 1917, when he put forward the need to transform to a socialist revolution, given that the number of proletarians in Russia at that time was still small, "the surging petty-bourgeois wave swallowed everything, and it overwhelmed not only the conscious proletariat in quantity but also in thought," and the party only accounted for a minority in the majority of workers' representative Soviets. Lenin also repeatedly pointed out that the "immediate task" of the revolution at that time was not "to 'implement' socialism, but only to immediately transition to the supervision of the production and distribution of social products by the workers' representative Soviets." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 24, p. 4) And he pointed out, "In order for us to smoothly solve the task of our country's direct transition to socialism, we must understand what kind of intermediate roads, methods, means, and auxiliary measures are needed to transition various pre-capitalist relations to socialism. The whole key lies here." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 32, p. 341) Lenin also foresaw that the transition to a communist society would require several stages. In his book "Left-Wing Childishness," he said: "From the communist point of view, denying the party is tantamount to jumping from the eve of the bankruptcy of capitalism (in Germany) to the highest stage of communism without going through the lower and middle stages of communism."

    The task of the proletariat that has won the revolution should be to develop, aid, and arouse the revolutions of all countries in the world.
    Lenin's theory of uninterrupted revolution is not only limited to the domestic aspect, but he is also an advocate of the continuous development of world revolution. Lenin never regarded the Russian revolution as an isolated event. He repeatedly emphasized that "The task of the Russian proletariat is to carry the Russian bourgeois democratic revolution to the end in order to launch the socialist revolution in Europe." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 21, p. 381) After the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin never regarded the Soviet Republic as the ultimate goal. He always regarded it as a necessary link to strengthen the revolutionary movement in the West and East. Lenin said that the task of the country that has won the revolution lies in "Maximally realize everything that can be realized in one country in order to develop, aid, and arouse the revolutions of all countries in the world."

    All of Lenin's ideas on the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages are brilliant contributions to the treasure house of Marxism and have a huge and far-reaching influence in the international workers' movement.

    (II)
    Comrade Mao Zedong, whether in the stage of our country's democratic revolution or in the stage of socialist revolution, followed and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, and continuously guided our country's revolution from one victory to another. When we were carrying out the democratic revolution, we saw the prospects of socialism, strived for the thorough victory of the democratic revolution, and prepared conditions to transform this revolution into a socialist revolution. In the democratic revolution, both the working class and the bourgeoisie opposed imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, but the working class and the national bourgeoisie had fundamentally different positions. In order to develop capitalism, the national bourgeoisie could either approve of the democratic revolution or remain conservatively neutral, but they feared and opposed the socialist revolution. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie, in the democratic revolution, feared the thorough victory of the revolution. The national bourgeoisie showed its two-sidedness in the democratic revolution. It had a revolutionary side and a counter-revolutionary side, that is, a side of wavering, compromise, and incompleteness. We communists, on the contrary, believe that the democratic revolution is only preparing the prerequisites for the socialist revolution, only the first step of the Long March. Therefore, we must seize the leadership of the revolution from the national bourgeoisie, establish the leadership of the working class in the democratic revolution, so as to completely complete the democratic revolution, and then further realize the socialist revolution. One of the important reasons why our country's democratic revolution was able to proceed so thoroughly, why we did not need to have another bloody revolution after the victory of the democratic revolution, and why our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction were able to achieve such great achievements in a short period of time is that the leadership of the working class had already been established during the period of the democratic revolution.

    The theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages are a unity of opposites, complementing each other, without one there is no other, one-sidedness will make mistakes.
    The experience of the Chinese revolutionary movement proves that: Recognizing the goal, actively striving for it (the theory of uninterrupted revolution), and at the same time, according to the actual situation, distinguishing the stages, determining the current specific tasks, and moving towards the goal step by step (the theory of revolutionary development stages), these two are closely combined together, and the revolution can achieve continuous victories. If you lose sight of the long-term goal, you will lose your way; if you have a goal, but you cannot see the specific stages that must be passed before reaching the goal, and you want to jump over it in one step, you will not achieve the ultimate goal of the revolution either. The view of uninterrupted revolution and the view of the stages of revolutionary development are a unity of opposites, complementing each other, without one there is no other, one-sidedness will make mistakes. During the democratic revolution stage in our country, right-leaning opportunists always opposed the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution. Right-leaning opportunism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology within the party. During the democratic revolution, our party had right-leaning opportunist lines such as Chen Duxiu and Wang Ming. The characteristic of these right-leaning opportunist lines was that they all advocated handing over the leadership of the revolution to the bourgeoisie. They all opposed the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the leadership of the working class in the democratic revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong criticized these right-leaning opportunists, saying: "To complete the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution (the new democratic revolution) and prepare to transform it into the stage of socialist revolution when all necessary conditions are available is the glorious and great revolutionary task of the Chinese Communist Party. Every Communist Party member should strive for this and must never give up halfway. ... Every Communist Party member must know that the entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party is an entire revolutionary movement including the two stages of democratic revolution and socialist revolution; these are two revolutionary processes of different natures, and it is only possible to complete the former revolutionary process before it is possible to complete the latter revolutionary process. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the ultimate goal of all communists is to strive for the final completion of socialist society and communist society. Only by recognizing the difference between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and at the same time recognizing the connection between the two, can we correctly lead the Chinese revolution." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. 2, p. 646)

    "Left"-leaning opportunists always oppose the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolutionary development stages. During the period of the democratic revolution, our party also experienced three "left"-leaning opportunist lines, namely the "left"-leaning blind actionism line, the Li Lisan line, and the first Wang Ming line. The common characteristic of these "left"-leaning opportunist lines is that they confused the certain boundaries of the democratic revolution and socialism, and subjectively rushed to surpass the democratic revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong criticized these "left"-leaning opportunists at the time, saying: "The transformation of the revolution is a matter for the future. In the future, the democratic revolution will inevitably be transformed into a socialist revolution. Any transformation should be based on whether the conditions for the transformation are met, and the time will be quite long. Until all the necessary political and economic conditions are met, and until the transformation is beneficial rather than detrimental to the vast majority of people in the country, we should not easily talk about transformation. Doubting this point and hoping to transform it in a very short period of time, such as what some comrades in the past called the day when the democratic revolution began to win in important provinces, is the time when the revolution began to transform, is wrong." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. 1, p. 155)

    Comrade Mao Zedong had already made important developments in the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages during the period of the democratic revolution. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1928 that in our country, "There is no doubt that the small red areas will exist for a long time, and these red areas will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national power." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. 1, p. 52) This idea later developed into a strategic policy of establishing revolutionary base areas in the countryside, encircling the cities from the countryside, and finally achieving the goal of seizing the cities. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong published the book "On Protracted War" ten months after the start of the war. "On Protracted War" predicted that the War of Resistance Against Japan would be divided into three stages. "The first stage is the period of the enemy's strategic offensive and our strategic defense. The second stage is the period of the enemy's strategic conservatism and our preparation for counter-offensive. The third stage is the period of our strategic counter-offensive and the enemy's strategic retreat." "China's transition from inferiority to balance to superiority, Japan's transition from superiority to balance to inferiority, China's transition from defense to stalemate to counter-offensive, Japan's transition from offensive to conservatism to retreat—this is the process of the Sino-Japanese War, and the inevitable trend of the Sino-Japanese War." During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War (that is, the Liberation War), Comrade Mao Zedong also made a prediction about the process of war development very early. He predicted that this war would go through three stages, namely the stage of the enemy's offensive and our defense, the counter-offensive stage, and the stage of "issuing a notice to determine" and liberating the whole of China. These predictions have all been confirmed by history. It is easy to understand how important these predictions are to the development of the revolutionary cause. It illuminated the progress of the movement for the whole party and the people of the country, greatly encouraged the confidence in victory, and at the same time prevented possible impetuosity, enabling all comrades in the party to have a clear head and correctly arrange various tasks in various periods.

    The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked the completion of our country's new democratic revolution and the beginning of the socialist revolution, which has now been ten years.

    In the process of quantitative change of things, there are partial qualitative changes, so the big stage contains some smaller stages.
    The great victories of revolution and construction in our country over the past ten years have also been realized under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages. The history of ten years fully proves that the more thorough the democratic revolution is carried out, the more favorable conditions there will be for the socialist revolution; the more thorough the socialist revolution is, the more favorable conditions there will be for socialist construction. This is precisely the guiding ideology of all our work over the past ten years, and practice has proved that this is completely correct. At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in the process of quantitative change of things, there are also partial qualitative changes, forming many small stages of qualitative change. In our work, we also follow this law. Each large revolutionary stage is divided into some smaller stages, and when we carry out each mass movement, we are prepared, planned, and step-by-step. For example, agricultural cooperation is divided into several stages, such as organizing mutual aid teams, organizing primary (semi-socialist) agricultural production cooperatives, and organizing advanced (socialist collective ownership) agricultural production cooperatives. The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also carried out step by step, that is, through various forms of state capitalism, namely the low-level forms of processing orders and unified purchase and sales and the advanced forms of joint state-private ownership of individual enterprises and joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, gradually replacing the capitalist ownership with public ownership, completing its transition to socialism. The ideological transformation of intellectuals is divided into several stages, such as eliminating feudal and comprador thoughts, opposing bourgeois thoughts, combining education with productive labor, and intellectuals participating in labor. The previous stage and the next stage of each movement are mutually related and distinguished. Each movement raises the awareness of the masses one step further, preparing conditions for the next stage of the movement. This is an example of Comrade Mao Zedong applying the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages to actual struggle and practical work, which is why our revolution has continuously and rapidly achieved victory.

    (III)
    Our country's socialist revolution and construction have already achieved great victories, but we must never be satisfied and stop moving forward. We must accelerate socialist construction and actively prepare conditions to transition to a communist society.

    Socialist society is a beautiful society. Here, the public ownership of the means of production has been established, the purpose of production is to meet the needs of the entire society, and the national economy is developing at a high speed and proportionally, with unparalleled superiority over capitalist society. From capitalist society to communist society, socialism is an insurmountable stage. As Marx pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program," "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period, and the state of this period can only be the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat."

    However, socialism is not our highest ideal. Our highest ideal is communist society. Although socialist society is beautiful, it is still a low-level stage of communist society that has just been born from the old society, is not mature, and is in transition. It still carries the remnants and traces of the old society in the economic, political, and ideological aspects. Since we are communists, we must carry out revolutionary changes in the economic, political, and ideological aspects, gradually eliminate these remnants and traces left over from capitalism, and push socialist society to a mature communist society. Building socialism is for the purpose of transitioning to communist society, not to fix socialism as a fixed and unchanging historical period with only quantitative changes and no qualitative changes.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people has advanced the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, the theory of socialism and communism, to a new stage.
    Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of our country's socialist revolution and the experience in the international workers' movement, and clearly pointed out that in the socialist period of transition from capitalism to communism, our country and people are both unified and united, and full of contradictions and struggles.

    The contradictions and struggles in the socialist transition stage are mainly manifested as the contradictions and changes between the productive forces and the relations of production, and between the foundation and the superstructure. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the people": "In socialist society, the basic contradictions are still the contradictions between the relations of production and the forces of production, and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base." "Socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces. In addition to this situation of both adaptation and contradiction between the relations of production and the development of productive forces, there is also a situation of both adaptation and contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base."

    This means that the relations of production and the superstructure have a positive role in promoting the development of productive forces. However, the productive forces are the most active and revolutionary element in production. The contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production is eternal. As the productive forces grow, the relations of production must be constantly changed to suit the development of the productive forces. The contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base is also eternal. As the social economic base changes, the superstructure must also be constantly changed to serve the development of the economic base. Of cause, these contradictions in socialist society are fundamentally different in nature and situation from the contradictions between the relations of production and the forces of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base in the old society. But contradictions always exist. Because of the continuous struggle and continuous resolution of these contradictions, the society is constantly changing and eventually completes the transition to communist society. Therefore, during the period of socialist construction, that is, the stage of transition to communism, we should still adhere to the theory of uninterrupted revolution. If we forget this point and do not carry out continuous revolution towards the goal of communism, we will lose our way and stagnate.

    The contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, are mainly manifested as class struggle throughout the transition period from capitalism to communism. Because social groups and individuals who adhere to and maintain the old relations of production and the superstructure will always resist the new relations of production and the superstructure. This struggle is long-term, not only because classes still exist and the transformation of the old economic system has not been fully completed, but also because the habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, as well as the bourgeois world outlook and political influence, cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, and it will take a long time to overcome them.

    Even in communist society, there will still be revolutions, but the nature and methods of those revolutions will be different.
    Some people believe that once the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated in our country, there will be no need for revolution or struggle anymore. This view is incorrect. Comrade Mao Zedong has always believed that the law of unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law is universally present in nature, human society, and people's thoughts. The opposing aspects of contradiction are both unified and struggling, thereby promoting the movement and change of things. The idea of ​​no contradiction is a naive idea that does not conform to objective reality. Denying contradiction is denying dialectics. Indeed, after the socialist revolution is completed, the classes that hinder us from realizing communism will no longer exist, but will the individuals, groups, and strata that hinder us from realizing communism still exist? They are bound to exist. Comrade Mao Zedong said that even after the transition period is over and classes are completely eliminated, from the domestic situation alone, politics is entirely a matter of relations within the people. At that time, there will certainly still be ideological struggles, political struggles, and revolutions between people, and it is impossible not to have them. the law of unity of opposites, the law of quantitative change and qualitative change, and the law of affirmation of negation will always universally exist. Only the nature and methods of the revolution are different from the past, but it is a struggle between the advanced and the backward within the people, and a struggle between the advanced and the backward of social systems. Even in the communist era, there will certainly be many, many stages of development, and the relationship between these stages must be a relationship from quantitative change to qualitative change. All kinds of mutations and leaps are a revolution, and they must go through struggle. The "theory of no conflict" is metaphysical. Wherever there are crowds of people, there will be left, middle, and right, and it will be the same ten thousand years later.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's extremely profound and thorough thoughts are the theoretical basis for various work policies in our country's transition period, and are new and major developments in Marxist-Leninist theory, and after Lenin, the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, the theory of socialism and communism has been advanced to another new stage.

    The practice of socialist revolution and construction in our country fully proves the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory. Not only at the beginning of the socialist stage must the tasks left over from the democratic revolutionary period be thoroughly completed, such as carrying out land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, etc.; in carrying out socialist transformation and construction, that is to say, the entire socialist transition period is full of class struggle. After the socialist revolution on the economic front in our country was basically completed in 1956, some people once believed that the class struggle had passed, but practice immediately denied this idea. In the first half of 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied offensive, and the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly led the people of the country to carry out a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This revolution achieved a great victory, and in 1958, the great leap forward of the national economy and the communization of the people were realized. However, the class struggle was not over. In 1959, the anti-socialist capitalist forces in urban and rural areas frantically opposed the party's general line for socialist construction. This struggle was also reflected in our party, and a small number of right-leaning opportunists who spoke for them appeared. These situations have great educational significance for us. It shows that the working class has seized power, the socialist revolution on the economic front has been basically completed, and the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts does not mean that the bourgeoisie has been eliminated, the anti-socialist forces are gone, and the struggle between the two roads can be ended. There will certainly be class struggle, but the forms and nature of the performance will be different.

    Now, in terms of relations of production, our country's social economy is basically public ownership, and private ownership of the means of production has been basically eliminated. However, there are still two kinds of public ownership in our country, namely public ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. It will take a process to become a single public ownership by the whole people.

    There is no end to adjusting and improving the relationship between people.
    In addition to ownership relations, the relationship between people in labor production is an important aspect of the relations of production. Now the relationship between people in our society, between leaders and those led, between workers and peasants, between all laborers, and between various groups and units in society, due to our country's excellent system, such as the two participations, one reform, three combinations, cadre transfer, generals serving as soldiers, cadres cultivating experimental fields, large-scale cooperation between various regions and various production departments, etc., has formed a relationship of mutual support, mutual cooperation, common development, and common improvement, a communist, comradely mutual aid and cooperation relationship in our society. This is fundamentally different from the selfish and deceitful relationship under the capitalist system. However, this relationship still needs to be greatly developed. The currently existing differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental labor and physical labor in our country, and the remnants of bourgeois rights that reflect these three differences, still need to be eliminated. This means that the relationship between people must be continuously adjusted. In the eyes of Marxist-Leninists, there is no end to adjusting and improving the relationship between people.

    Another aspect of the relations of production is the distribution relationship. Now we are implementing the principle of each according to their ability, distribution according to work. According to the current development of productive forces in our country, it is necessary to use this principle. However, distribution according to work is not an ideal distribution principle. It will inevitably produce the unequal phenomenon of people's shares obtained in the distribution of products. This distribution method is still based on equivalent exchange in principle, and is still bourgeois rights. Therefore, we must never regard this system as sacred and inviolable, and we must continuously adjust and improve it, and implement the completely ideal principle of each according to their ability and distribution according to need when conditions are ripe.

    In terms of the superstructure, our country has established a consolidated proletarian dictatorship regime, and Marxism-Leninism also occupies a dominant position in the ideological field, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of the socialist economic base. However, it should also be seen that the habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will still need a long time to be completely overcome.

    It can be seen from this that throughout the transition period, we must continue to revolutionize and continuously adjust and change the relations of production and the superstructure, which cannot but cause class struggle. That is to say, the entire socialist transition stage will be full of political struggle and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and economic construction will definitely be accompanied by social revolution. The view that the political revolution has disappeared forever under the socialist system, and that the transformation from socialism to communism is not a mutation, not a revolutionary view, is metaphysical, violates Marxism-Leninism, and violates the theory of uninterrupted revolution.

    We are both proponents of uninterrupted revolution and proponents of revolutionary development stages. Therefore, in the process of transitioning to communism, we should carefully distinguish between socialist principles and communist principles, and oppose surpassing the necessary stages of social historical development. And in each stage of social historical development, we must also carefully distinguish several smaller stages that are relatively quantitative in nature according to the specific circumstances. From now on, until the realization of communist society in our country, whether in terms of ownership, distribution, exchange, consumption, or various social relations, it will go through various changes,

    马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论
    迟蓼洲
    不断革命论和革命发展阶段论是马克思列宁主义者的世界观，是马克思列宁主义战略和策略的基础，是工人阶级斗争的理论武器
    不断革命，是马克思列宁主义的灵魂。在马克思列宁主义者看来，世界上的一切事物，都是不断运动，不断变化，不断革新，不断发展的。马克思说过，“生产力的增长，社会关系的破坏，思想的产生都是不断变动的，只有运动的抽象即‘不死的死’才是停滞不动的。”（“哲学的贫困”）恩格斯说，“辩证法哲学认为一切和任何事物都有着不可避免的灭亡的印迹；在它看来，除了不断的发生和消灭的过程，除了无穷的由低级进到高级的上升过程以外，没有任何东西是永存的。”（“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”）毛泽东同志也指出，“新陈代谢是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抵抗的规律。依事物本身的性质和条件，经过不同的飞跃形式，一事物转化为他事物，就是新陈代谢的过程。”（“矛盾论”）在社会生活中，这种“新陈代谢”就是社会革命的交替，就是不断革命。马克思列宁主义者同时又认为，事物在不断的运动过程中，又有着各个不同的发展阶段，这些不同的发展阶段不应混淆。每一事物都有它质的规定性，质的相对稳定性，只有事物的量的变化到了一定的程度，才会引起事物的质的变化，才会由一事物转化为他事物。这样，每一个由量变到质变的过程，就形成为一个阶段，把它同前一个和后一个阶段区别开来。同时，在事物的量变过程中，又包含着部分的质变，形成质变的许多小的阶段。这种事物发展的状况，在社会革命中，就是革命发展阶段论。不断革命论和革命发展阶段论是对立的统一，它们既有区别，又不能彼此分开。辩证法告诉我们，事物的变动是绝对的，稳定是相对的，革命方面是绝对的，保守方面是相对的。因此，不断革命是绝对的，革命的阶段是相对的。做一个马克思主义者，只有完整地掌握这个思想，才能永远站在斗争的前列。
    （一）
    无产阶级的战斗口号是：不停顿的革命
    不断革命论早在1850年马克思、恩格斯所写的著名的“中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书”中就提出来了。当时马克思、恩格斯指出，无产者的利益和任务，是“要革命成为不停顿的”，“他们的战斗口号应该是：‘不停顿的革命’”。
    马克思、恩格斯最初也是把不断革命论与革命发展阶段论结合起来的。恩格斯在1894年的一封信中，指出不要把小资产阶级的民主革命和社会主义革命混同起来。在“哥达纲领批判”一书中，马克思明确指出，“在资本主义社会与共产主义社会之间，横着一个从前者进到后者的革命转变时期。”这就是把共产主义划分为社会主义和共产主义两个阶段，并把社会主义作为一个过渡性的革命阶段，应该说，这是不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的一个最辉煌的思想。
    马克思、恩格斯死后，列宁捍卫和发展了不断革命的理论。当时，在国际工人运动中，第二国际的修正主义者歪曲和抛弃了马克思、恩格斯的不断革命论，断定在资产阶级民主革命和无产阶级社会主义革命两个阶段之间隔着一道万里长城、一个以几十年计算的间断时间。伯恩斯坦的“运动就是一切，最终目的算不了什么”更是典型地表现了他们不要最终目的、背叛社会主义革命的立场。列宁认为伯恩斯坦这句流行一时的话，要比许多长篇议论更能表明修正主义的实质。
    在俄国，也出现了形形色色的机会主义者，他们或者反对不断革命论，或者反对革命发展阶段论。在1905年革命高涨的形势下，孟什维克的“代表会议”所提出的机会主义策略，就是否认无产阶级应该领导资产阶级革命，把民主革命进行到底，以便使革命不停顿地转变为社会主义革命。
    列宁坚决驳斥了那种认为资产阶级民主革命阶段与社会主义革命阶段隔了一个万里长城的谬论，他指出除了无产阶级的准备程度和无产阶级同贫苦农民联合的程度以外，企图用其他东西来分开这两个革命，企图在它们中间建筑一道万里长城，就是用自由主义代替马克思列宁主义。而且，他进一步指出，民主革命和社会主义革命两个阶段既有区别，又有联系，“在具体的历史环境中，过去和将来的成份交织在一起，前后两条道路互相交错。……但是这丝毫不妨碍我们从逻辑上和历史上把发展过程的几大阶段分开。我们大家都认为资产阶级革命和社会主义革命是截然不同的东西，我们大家都无条件地坚决主张必须把这两种革命极严格地区分开，但是，难道可以否认前后两种革命的个别枝节成份在历史上互相交错的事实吗？难道在欧洲民主革命的时代没有许多社会主义运动和争取社会主义的企图吗？难道欧洲不是还有许许多多民主主义性质的事情要由将来的社会主义革命去最终完成吗？”（“列宁全集”第9卷70页）所以列宁指出在民主革命中应该竭力扩大阶级斗争的范围和内容，一直到不仅包括俄国当时的全民民主革命的一切任务，而且包括今后社会主义革命的任务。他一再强调，“我们主张不断革命，我们决不半途而废”，在民主革命中“一分钟也不要忘记自己的社会主义目的”，“一分钟也不要忘记潜藏在资产阶级民主运动里面的新矛盾，一分钟也不要忘记新斗争。”
    在由民主革命转变为社会主义革命问题上，列宁杰出地发展了马克思主义。他根据无产阶级力量已经大大发展、资本主义已经腐朽、资产阶级在民主革命中的惯于妥协和叛变的本性，强调了无产阶级必须在民主革命中掌握领导权。这是帝国主义时代与资本主义上升时期的资产阶级民主革命的根本区别所在。他找到了无产阶级在两个革命中的同盟军——农民，规定了在不同阶段的阶级路线和专政形式。他发现了资本主义发展不平衡的规律，提出了社会主义革命可以在一个国家胜利的理论，从根本上粉碎了机会主义者取消社会主义革命的理论和一切悲观主义思想。
    前一革命进行得越彻底，后一革命就开展得越迅速、越顺利
    在由民主革命转变为社会主义革命问题上，列宁指出另一个关键是革命的彻底性。他说：“民主革命实现得愈完全，这个新的斗争（指社会主义革命——作者）就会开展得愈早，愈广泛，愈纯粹，愈坚决。”（“列宁全集”第9卷第115页）
    在由民主革命转变为社会主义革命的问题上，列宁特别坚持了战斗的马克思主义者的暴力革命的原则。早在俄国第一次革命时，他就辛辣地嘲笑了孟什维克的机会主义幻想说：“可怜的俄国呵！人们曾说它总是戴着欧洲早已抛弃了的旧式帽子。我们这里还没有什么国会，甚至布里根也还没有约许设立国会，而国会迷却已非常流行了。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第1卷611页）确实，列宁在二月革命以后一个短时期，曾经指出过用群众性的政治斗争，和平取得政权的可能性。因为那时是两个政权并存的局面，如果能迫使资产阶级将全部政权归苏维埃，那当然是再好也没有的事。但是，在资产阶级发动了反革命的七月事件以后，列宁就及时指出，革命的和平发展的可能性没有了，要建立无产阶级专政不用暴力是不行的，因此他在许多著作中极力反对了孟什维克主张通过议会进行斗争的论调。在“国家与革命”一书中他说：“资产阶级国会由无产阶级国家（无产阶级专政）所替代，是不能经过‘自行消亡’来实现，而按通例是只能经过暴力革命来实现。”俄国十月革命和中国革命的经验，都完全证明了这个真理的正确性。
    列宁在“国家与革命”等著作中，指出由共产主义的低级阶段到共产主义的高级阶段，也是一个不断革命的过程。他分析了社会主义社会的过渡性质，指出，社会主义社会在经济上、政治上、思想上还不能完全摆脱资本主义的传统或痕迹，它还不是完全的、成熟的共产主义社会。它必须向共产主义的高级阶段，向完全的、成熟的共产主义过渡。列宁说：“我们开始社会主义改造的时候，应当给自己清楚地提出这些改造归根到底所要达到的目的，即建立共产主义社会的目的。”（“列宁全集”第27卷第114页）
    实现共产主义是共产党人的最终目的，我们决不能忘记这个目的，必须把革命进行到底。但是，为着将来实现共产主义社会制度，这需要经过一些必要的阶段，而不可能“一蹴即就”。马克思说过：“一个社会就是已经把它的运动的自然法则发现，它也还是不能跳过或者以法令废止自然的发展阶段。”
    根据这个原理，列宁充分发挥和发展了革命发展阶段论。早在1905年，列宁针对着孟什维克的机会主义策略，在“两个策略”一书中，精辟的分析了当时俄国社会经济发展状况，革命对象，阶级关系等客观条件，以及工人阶级和农民的觉悟程度等主观条件，指出当时革命的性质和任务是资产阶级民主革命而不是社会主义革命。他说，现在实行民主革命，“并不是迁延社会主义革命，而是唯一可能的方法，唯一正确可能的道路，即按民主共和制度的道路来实行走向社会主义的第一步。”指出：“民粹主义者和无政府主义者说什么像俄国这样的国家可以避免资本主义发展，可以不经过在资本主义的基础上和范围内进行阶级斗争的道路，而经过其他道路来跳出或跳过这个资本主义。”是反动的荒谬结论。（“列宁全集”第9卷33页）即使在1917年二月革命后提出了必须向社会主义革命转变的时候，鉴于当时俄国无产阶级数量还少，“汹涌的小资产阶级浪潮吞没了一切，它不仅在数量上而且也在思想上压倒了觉悟的无产阶级”，党在大多数工人代表苏维埃中还只占少数，列宁也一再指出，当时革命的“直接任务并不是‘实行’社会主义，而只是立刻过渡到由工人代表苏维埃监督社会的产品生产和分配”。（“列宁全集”第24卷4页）并且指出，“为了使我们能顺利地解决我国直接向社会主义过渡的任务，就必须懂得，需要经过什么样的中间道路、方法、手段和补助办法，才能将资本主义以前的各种关系过渡到社会主义去。全部关键就在这里。”（“列宁全集”第32卷341页）列宁还曾预见到过渡到共产主义社会需要经过若干阶段。他在“左派幼稚病”一书中说：“从共产主义的观点来看，否认党就无异是从资本主义破产的前夜（在德国），而不经过共产主义低级阶段和中级阶段，一跃而至共产主义的最高阶段。”
    革命获得胜利的无产阶级的任务应该发展、援助和激起世界各国的革命
    列宁的不断革命论不仅限于国内方面，他同时还是世界革命不断发展论者。列宁从来不把俄国革命看成孤立的事件。他反复强调，“俄国无产阶级的任务就是要把俄国的资产阶级民主革命进行到底，以掀起欧洲的社会主义革命。”（“列宁全集”第21卷第381页）十月革命胜利后，列宁也从来没有把苏维埃共和国看做最终目的。他始终把它看做是加强西方和东方各国革命运动的必要环节。列宁说，革命获得胜利的国家的任务就在于“最大限度地实现一个国家内所能实现的一切，以便发展、援助和激起世界各国的革命”。
    列宁的所有这些关于不断革命论与革命发展阶段论的思想，都是对马克思主义宝库的辉煌贡献，在国际工人运动中起着巨大的深远的影响。
    （二）
    毛泽东同志不论在我国民主革命阶段，或是社会主义革命阶段，都遵循并且发展了马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，不断地引导我国革命由一个胜利到另一个胜利。当我们进行民主革命的时候，我们就看到社会主义的前途，努力争取民主革命的彻底胜利，并且准备条件，使这个革命转变到社会主义革命。在民主革命中，工人阶级同资产阶级都反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，但是工人阶级同民族资产阶级有根本不同的立场。民族资产阶级为了发展资本主义，可以赞成民主革命或者保守中立，但是他们害怕和反对社会主义革命。因此，民族资产阶级在民主革命中，就害怕革命的彻底胜利。民族资产阶级在民主革命中表现出它的两面性，它有革命的一面，又有反革命的一面，即动摇性、妥协性、不彻底性的一面。我们共产党人与此相反，认为民主革命只是为社会主义革命准备先决条件，只是万里长征的第一步，因此，必须把革命的领导权从民族资产阶级手中夺取过来，在民主革命中就建立起工人阶级的领导权，以便彻底完成民主革命，然后进一步实现社会主义革命。我国民主革命所以能够进行得如此彻底，我们所以无须在民主革命胜利之后再来一次流血的革命，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所以能够在短期内取得如此巨大的成绩，其重要原因之一，就是在民主革命的时期已经建立起工人阶级的领导权。
    不断革命论与革命发展阶段论是对立的统一，相辅相成，无此即无彼，片面性就要犯错误
    中国革命运动的经验证明：认清目标，积极为此奋斗（不断革命论），同时又根据实际情况，分清阶段，确定当前的具体任务，一步一步地向目标前进（革命发展阶段论），这二者密切地结合在一起，革命就能取得不断地胜利。如果失去了长远目标，就会迷失方向；有了目标，但看不到达到目标以前所必须经过的各具体阶段，想一步跨过去，就也达不到革命的最后目标。不断革命观点，同革命发展阶段的观点，是对立的统一，是相辅相成的，无此即无彼，片面性就要犯错误。在我国民主革命阶段，右倾机会主义者总是反对马克思列宁主义的不断革命论。右倾机会主义，是资产阶级思想在党内的反映。在民主革命的时期里，我们党内出现过陈独秀和王明等的右倾机会主义路线。这些右倾机会主义的路线，其特点都是主张把革命的领导权送给资产阶级。它们都反对马克思列宁主义的不断革命论，都反对工人阶级在民主革命中的领导权。
    毛泽东同志批评这些右倾机会主义者说：“完成中国资产阶级民主主义的革命（新民主主义的革命），并准备在一切必要条件具备的时候把它转变到社会主义革命的阶段上去，这就是中国共产党光荣的伟大的全部革命任务。每个共产党员都应为此而奋斗，绝对不能半途而废。……每个共产党员须知，中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，是包括民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段在内的全部革命运动；这是两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。只有认清民主主义革命和社会主义革命的区别，同时又认清二者的联系，才能正确地领导中国革命。”（“毛泽东选集”第2卷第646页）
    “左”倾机会主义者则总是反对马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论。在民主主义革命时期里，我们党内也出现过三次“左”倾机会主义路线，即“左”倾盲动主义路线、李立三路线和第一次王明路线。这些“左”倾机会主义路线的共同特点，就是混淆了民主革命和社会主义的一定界限，并主观地急于要超越民主革命。
    毛泽东同志当时批评这些“左”倾机会主义者说：“革命的转变，那是将来的事。在将来，民主主义的革命必然要转变为社会主义的革命。任何转变，应以是否具备了转变的条件为标准，时间会要相当地长。不到具备了政治上经济上一切应有的条件之时，不到转变对于全国最大多数人民有利而不是不利之时，不应当轻易谈转变。怀疑这一点而希望在很短的时间内去转变，如像过去某些同志所谓民主革命在重要省份开始胜利之日，就是革命开始转变之时，是不对的。”（“毛泽东选集”第1卷第155页）
    毛泽东同志在民主革命的时期，就已经对马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，作了重要的发展。在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志在1928年就指出，在我国，“小块红色区域的长期存在没有疑义，而且这些红色区域将继续发展，日渐接近于全国政权的取得。”（“毛泽东选集”第1卷第52页）这个思想后来发展成为：在农村建立革命根据地，经过农村包围城市，最后达到夺取城市的目的的战略方针。在抗日战争中，毛泽东同志在抗战开始后十个月，就出版了“论持久战”一书。“论持久战”预料抗日战争分为三个阶段。“第一个阶段，是敌之战略进攻、我之战略防御的时期。第二个阶段，是敌之战略保守、我之准备反攻的时期。第三个阶段，是我之战略反攻、敌之战略退却的时期。”“中国由劣势到平衡到优势，日本由优势到平衡到劣势，中国由防御到相持到反攻，日本由进攻到保守到退却——这就是中日战争的过程，中日战争的必然趋势。”第三次国内革命战争时期（即解放战争时期），毛泽东同志对于战争发展的过程，也很早就作了预计。他预计这个战争将要经历三个阶段，即是敌之进攻我之防御的阶段，反攻阶段，和“传檄而定”解放全中国的阶段。这些预见，都已经被历史所证实。这些预见，对于革命事业的发展有何等重要的意义，是很容易了解的。它对全党和全国人民，照亮了运动的进程，大大地鼓舞了胜利的信心，同时也防止了可能发生的急躁情绪，使全党同志有清醒的头脑，正确地安排各个时期的各项工作。
    1949年中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国的新民主主义革命的完成，和社会主义革命的开始，这个革命到现在已经十年了。
    在事物的量变过程中，包含着部分的质变，因此大的阶段中，又包含一些较小的阶段
    我国十年来革命和建设的伟大胜利，也是在马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论的思想指导之下实现的。十年的历史充分证明民主革命进行得愈加彻底，社会主义革命就会有更加顺利的条件；社会主义革命愈加彻底，社会主义建设就会有更加顺利的条件，这正是我国十年来全部工作的指导思想，实践证明这是完全正确的。同时，毛泽东同志指出，事物的量变过程中，又包含着部分的质变，形成质变的许多小阶段。我们在工作中，也遵循了这个规律。每一个大的革命阶段中，又分成一些较小的阶段，在进行每一个群众运动的时候，我们又是有准备，有计划，有步骤的。例如，农业合作化，就分成组织互助组，组织初级（半社会主义的）农业生产合作社，和组织高级（社会主义的集体所有制）农业生产合作社等几个阶段。对资本主义工商业的改造，也是有步骤地进行的，这就是通过国家资本主义的各种形式，即加工订货和统购包销的低级形式与个别企业的公私合营和全行业公私合营的高级形式，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家的所有制，完成其向社会主义的过渡。知识分子的思想改造，就分成肃清封建和买办思想，反对资产阶级思想，教育与生产劳动相结合和知识分子参加劳动等几个阶段。每个运动的前一阶段和后一阶段，互相联系又互相区别。每个运动把群众的觉悟提高一步，为运动的下一个阶段准备条件。这是毛泽东同志把不断革命论和革命发展阶段论运用到实际斗争和实际工作中的范例，这就是我们的革命不断地而且迅速地取得胜利的原因。
    （三）
    我国社会主义革命和建设已经取得了伟大的胜利，但是我们决不能满足、停顿不前，必须加速社会主义建设，积极准备条件过渡到共产主义社会。
    社会主义社会是一个美好的社会。在这里，生产资料公有制已经建立，生产的目的是满足整个社会的需要，国民经济是高速度地、按比例地发展的，比资本主义社会有着无比的优越性。从资本主义社会到共产主义社会，社会主义是一个不可逾越的阶段。正如马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中指出的，“在资本主义社会与共产主义社会之间，横着一个从前者进到后者的革命转变时期，同这个时期相适合的也有一个政治过渡时期，而这个时期的国家则只能是无产阶级的革命专政。”
    但是，社会主义却并不是我们的最高理想。我们的最高理想是共产主义社会。社会主义社会虽然美好，但它还是一个刚刚从旧社会诞生的、没有成熟的、正在过渡中的低级阶段的共产主义社会，它在经济上、政治上和思想上还带有旧社会的残余和痕迹。我们既然是共产主义者，就必须在经济、政治、思想各方面进行革命的变革，逐步肃清这些资本主义遗留下来的残余和痕迹，把社会主义社会推进到成熟的共产主义社会去。建设社会主义，是为了过渡到共产主义社会去，而不是要把社会主义社会定型化，把它当作一个固定不变的、或者只有量变没有质变的历史时期。
    毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论，把不断革命论与革命发展阶段论，把社会主义和共产主义的理论，推进到了一个新阶段
    毛泽东同志总结了我国社会主义革命的经验和国际工人运动中的经验，明确指出在由资本主义向共产主义过渡的社会主义时期，我们国家和人民，既是统一和团结的，又是充满着矛盾和斗争的。
    社会主义过渡阶段的矛盾和斗争主要表现为生产力和生产关系、基础和上层建筑的矛盾和变革。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中指出：“在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。”“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。”
    这就是说，生产关系、上层建筑对生产力的发展有积极的促进作用。但生产力是生产中最活动最革命的要素。生产力与生产关系之间的矛盾是永远存在的，随着生产力的增长，生产关系必须不断改变以适合生产力的发展。上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾也是永远存在的，随着社会经济基础的改变，上层建筑也要不断改变，来服务于经济基础的发展。当然，社会主义社会的这些矛盾，同旧社会的生产关系和生产力的矛盾、上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，具有根本不同的性质和情况。但是矛盾总是依然存在的。由于这些矛盾的不断斗争和不断解决，就使社会不断地变革、并终而完成向共产主义社会的过渡。因此，在社会主义建设时期，即向共产主义过渡的阶段，我们也仍然应该坚持不断革命论，忘记了这一点，不朝着共产主义目标实行不断的革命，就会迷失方向和停滞不前。
    生产关系和生产力之间，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾，在从资本主义到共产主义的整个过渡时期中，主要地表现为阶级斗争。因为坚持和维护旧的生产关系、上层建筑的社会集团和个人，总要对新的生产关系、上层建筑进行抵抗。这种斗争是长期的，这不仅因为阶级依然存在，旧的经济制度的改造还没有全部完成，而且因为资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力，以及资产阶级的世界观和政治影响不可能在短期内消灭，还需要很长时间才能克服。
    即使到了共产主义社会，仍然要产生革命，只是那时的革命，在性质上和方法上不同罢了
    有人认为，当资产阶级在我国最后被消灭以后，就再不需要革命、再不需要斗争了。这种看法是不对的。毛泽东同志始终认为对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。矛盾着的对立面又统一，又斗争，由此推动事物的运动和变化。没有矛盾的想法是不符合客观实际的天真的想法。否认矛盾，就是否认辩证法。确实，在完成社会主义革命以后，阻碍我们实现共产主义的阶级将不存在了，但是阻碍我们实现共产主义的个人、集团、阶层是否还存在呢？是必然会存在的。毛泽东同志说，即使过渡时期完结、彻底消灭阶级以后，单就国内情况说，政治完全是人民内部的关系，那时候，人和人之间的思想斗争、政治斗争和革命也一定还会有的，并且不可能没有。对立统一的规律，量变质变的规律，肯定否定的规律，永远普遍地存在。只是革命的性质和方法上跟过去不同，而是人民内部的先进和落后之间的斗争，社会制度的先进和落后之间的斗争。即使到了共产主义时代，一定还会有很多很多的发展阶段，这些阶段的关系必然是一种从量变到质变的关系。各种突变、飞跃都是一种革命，都要通过斗争，“无冲突论”是形而上学的。凡有人群的地方，都有左、中、右，一万年以后还会是这样。
    毛泽东同志的这些极为深刻透彻的思想，是我国过渡时期各项工作方针的理论基础，是对马克思列宁主义理论的新的重大的发展，是继列宁之后把不断革命论与革命发展阶段论，把社会主义、共产主义理论推进到了又一个崭新的阶段。
    我国的社会主义革命和建设的实践，充分证明了毛泽东同志这个理论的正确性。不但在社会主义阶段的开始，必须彻底完成民主革命时期的遗留任务，进行土地改革，镇压反革命，等等；在实行社会主义改造和建设中，也就是说，在整个社会主义过渡时期，都充满着阶级斗争。1956年我国的经济战线上的社会主义革命基本完成以后，曾经有人认为，阶级斗争已经过去了，但实践立即否定了这种想法。1957年上半年资产阶级右派就发动了一次猖狂的进攻，党中央和毛泽东同志及时领导全国人民进行了一场政治、思想战线上的社会主义革命。这个革命取得了伟大胜利，并在1958年实现了国民经济的大跃进和人民公社化。但是，阶级斗争并未完结，在1959年，反社会主义的城乡资本主义势力，又猖狂地反对党的社会主义建设总路线，这个斗争，并且反映到了我们党内，出现了一小批代表他们说话的右倾机会主义分子。这些情况，对我们有极大的教育意义。它说明，工人阶级取得政权，经济战线上的社会主义革命基本完成，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利，都并不意味着资产阶级已经消灭了，反社会主义的势力再也没有了，两条道路的斗争可以完结了。阶级斗争一定会有的，不过表现形式和性质有所不同罢了。
    现在，在生产关系方面，我国的社会经济基本上已是公有制了，生产资料私有制已经基本消灭了。但是，在我国还存在着两种公有制，即全民所有制和集体所有制。还要经过一个过程，变成单一的全民所有制。
    调整和改善人与人之间的关系是没有止境的
    生产关系中除了所有制关系外，人与人在劳动生产中的关系，是一个重要方面。现在我们社会中人与人之间的关系，在领导者和被领导者、在工人和农民、在所有劳动者之间、在社会的各集团和各单位之间，由于我国有一整套的优良的制度，如两参一改三结合、干部下放、将军当兵、干部种试验田、各个地区各个生产部门之间的大协作等等，就使我们社会里的人与人之间的关系，形成了一种互相支援、互相协作、共同发展、共同提高的共产主义的、同志的互助合作关系。这同资本主义制度下那种自私自利、尔虞我诈的关系，是根本不同的。但是，这种关系也还要大大发展。目前我国还存在的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，反映这三个差别的资产阶级式的权利的残余影响也还有待肃清。这就是说，人与人之间的关系还要不断调整。在马克思列宁主义者看来，调整和改善人与人之间的关系是没有止境的。
    生产关系中还有一个方面是分配关系。现在我们是实行各尽所能，按劳分配的原则。根据目前我国生产力的发展状况，是需要利用这个原则的。但是，按劳分配并不是理想的分配原则，它必然会产生人们在产品分配上所得份额的不平等现象。这种分配方法，在原则还是按照等价交换，还是资产阶级法权。因此决不能把这种制度看成神圣不可侵犯，必须不断地调整和改进，并在条件成熟时实行完全的理想的各尽所能，按需分配的原则。
    就上层建筑来说，我国已建立了巩固的无产阶级专政的政权，马克思列宁主义也在思想领域中占了统治地位，这是有利于社会主义经济基础的巩固和发展的。但是还应该看到，资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力还需要很长时期才能彻底克服。
    由此可见，在整个过渡时期内，我们还必须不断革命，不断调整，变革生产关系和上层建筑，这就不能不引起阶级斗争。也就是说，整个社会主义过渡阶段都将充满着无产阶级和资产阶级的政治斗争和思想斗争，经济建设一定会伴随着社会革命。那种认为在社会主义制度下，政治革命永远消失了，认为由社会主义转变为共产主义不是一个突变，不是一个革命的观点，是形而上学的，违反了马克思列宁主义，违反了不断革命论。
    我们既是不断革命论者，又是革命发展阶段论者。因此，在向共产主义过渡的过程中，应该认真区别社会主义原则和共产主义原则，反对超越必经的社会历史发展阶段。而且在每个社会历史发展阶段中，还要按照具体情况，认真区别若干相对地属于量变性质的较小的阶段。从现在起，到共产主义社会在我国的实现，无论在所有制方面，分配方面，交换方面，消费方面以及各种社会关系方面，都将经过种种变革，经过不同的发展阶段，同时还要进行艰巨的工作，把农民逐步提高到工人阶级的觉悟水平。党中央和毛泽东同志已经明确地指出了我国由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路、步骤，同时还创造了最好的组织形式，这就是人民公社。人民公社不但现在是我国由社会主义集体所有制过渡到社会主义全民所有制的最好的形式，而且在将来也会成为我国由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的社会组织形式。
    1958年8月中共中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”和1958年11月中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，都指出：人民公社由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，是一个过程，有些地方可能较快，三、四年内就可完成，有些地方可能较慢，需要五、六年或者更长一些时间。过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。然后再经过多少年，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会就将进入各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义时代。
    这两个决议，不仅解决了农村怎样从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的问题，而且也规定了我国将来会在什么条件下从社会主义的全民所有制过渡到共产主义的全民所有制的问题。它不仅指出了生产关系应该怎样与生产力相适应，而且指出了上层建筑应该怎样与经济基础相适应。它把马克思列宁主义的不断革命论同革命发展的阶段论密切结合在一起，对于我国社会主义建设的前景，作了明确的预计，因此，它有极大的理论的重要性，是指导我们的各方面的工作的根本方针。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社集中体现了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理
    我们党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线；广大群众为建设社会主义所实现的不断的、持续的大跃进；不仅是社会主义社会，而且也是共产主义社会的组织形式的人民公社，都集中体现了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理。坚决贯彻执行党的总路线、继续不断地跃进、不断巩固和发展人民公社，是我们加速社会主义建设、实现共产主义社会制度的唯一正确的道路。
    马克思、恩格斯在一百十一年前在“共产党宣言”里写道：“一个怪影在欧洲游荡着——共产主义的怪影。旧欧洲所有一切势力都为神圣地驱除这个怪影而联合起来了：教皇与沙皇，梅特?与基佐，法国急进党人与德国警探。”现在，全世界的一切反动力量，也都想联合起来，“驱除”我们的大跃进，“驱除”我们的人民公社，否定我们的社会主义建设总路线。但是，他们将是徒劳的。我们的人民公社是打不散的，我们的大跃进将继续下去，我们的社会主义建设总路线将坚持下去。让敌人和叛徒发抖去吧！我们将把自己的国家建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，然后进一步建设人类的最高理想共产主义。
