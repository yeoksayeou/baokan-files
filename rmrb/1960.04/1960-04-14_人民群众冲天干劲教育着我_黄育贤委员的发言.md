A bourgeois intellectual can only contribute his meager strength to the people under the leadership of the Communist Party and by placing himself among the people and constantly transforming his position and thoughts. Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report and the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our great motherland has entered the 1960s with its head held high, developing rapidly at an unprecedented speed. Before us, a magnificent scene that the people have dreamed of for many years has emerged, unfolding an extremely grand and beautiful picture, which is immensely joyful and encouraging.

Now, I would like to briefly talk about the situation of water conservancy and hydropower construction in our country since the Great Leap Forward, as well as some personal experiences.

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, three upsurges in water conservancy construction have been launched successively throughout the country. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses of the people, with soaring enthusiasm, have launched a major offensive against nature with the heroic spirit of making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. After three years of efforts, we have achieved extremely brilliant accomplishments. This past winter and spring, the broad masses of the people actively responded to the call of the Communist Party, thoroughly opposed rightist tendencies, and constantly boosted their energy, so this third upsurge in water conservancy developed even more vigorously and magnificently. At the peak of the upsurge, more than 70 million people across the country participated in this grand water conservancy construction. Up to now, more than 3.8 million water conservancy projects have been built nationwide, completing more than 27 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, expanding and improving the irrigated area by 290 million mu. Countless large and medium-sized reservoirs and canal projects are under active construction.

The water conservancy projects that have been built have already exerted tremendous benefits. Last year was the most severe year for natural disasters in our country since liberation, with nearly 650 million mu of land suffering from varying degrees of waterlogging and drought. However, thanks to the enormous power of the people's communes, the construction of water conservancy projects, and the arduous struggles, we finally overcame the disasters, reaped a bumper harvest, and successfully realized the continued Great Leap Forward.

The hydropower construction enterprise since the Great Leap Forward has also been advancing by leaps and bounds, keeping pace with water conservancy construction. In 1959, the country overfulfilled the state plan for hydropower, with large hydropower stations under active construction on all major rivers across the country, unprecedented in terms of construction scale and speed.

With the Great Leap Forward and great development of water conservancy and hydropower construction in our country, water conservancy and hydropower science and technology have also achieved leaps and bounds, accumulating extremely rich experience. For example, the application and promotion of various local material dams (including earth dams, sand and gravel dams, stacked stone dams, etc.) and lightweight dams (including large-head dams, arch dams, flat plate dams, etc.), the successful cutoff of rivers on the Yellow River and Han River, the promotion and application of directional large-scale blasting and underwater earth dumping for dam construction, and the foundation treatment method of using grouting and cast-in-place concrete cutoff walls in sand and gravel foundations have greatly enriched the treasure trove of water conservancy and hydropower science and technology experience in our country, saving a lot of building materials and funds, and continuously accelerating the construction speed.

Now, under the great call of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is rapidly unfolding on the water conservancy and hydropower front, forming a new upsurge, and many new things and new machines have emerged. Recently, all the employees of the Shenyang Survey and Design Institute of Liaoning Province, developing the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, marched towards "four modernizations," vigorously promoted the electrification of calculations, the tabulation of designs, the printing of drawings, and the manualization of commonly used data, and completed the annual plan 331 days ahead of schedule on February 4. In the Gansu Province's Yintao project, 60,000 migrant workers made a big fuss about the technical revolution, and all procedures have achieved earth mechanization, making efficiency increase by multiples, even tens or hundreds of times.

Since 1958, the sustained Great Leap Forward in our country's economic construction has fully demonstrated the unparalleled power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, these three magic weapons. From the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy and hydropower construction in our country, I deeply realized that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is it possible to carry out such an unprecedented construction undertaking and achieve such brilliant accomplishments. "Of all the thousands of things, the leadership of the Communist Party is the first" is indeed an irrefutable truth. At the same time, I also deeply realized that only the people are the masters of the world, and only labor can create the world. It is precisely because hundreds of millions of people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have displayed soaring enthusiasm that they can accomplish this great undertaking of transforming nature. In the past few years, due to work reasons, I often traveled to various water conservancy and hydropower construction sites, and I have been greatly educated by seeing the selfless labor enthusiasm, the fearless fighting spirit, the hot and bustling competition upsurge of catching up with each other, learning from each other, and helping each other of millions of workers at various construction sites, as well as the indomitable working spirit and hardworking and simple working style of the leading comrades of the Communist Party committees at each construction site. Some water conservancy projects, dams with tens of millions of cubic meters of earthwork, were built to flood control elevation within a year, successfully blocking floods. These are miraculous appearances in water conservancy and hydropower construction. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the lofty aspirations and arduous struggle of the broad masses of the people to complete socialist construction, it would be impossible to achieve.

From this, I also deeply realized that a bourgeois intellectual can only contribute his meager strength to the people under the leadership of the Communist Party and by placing himself among the people and constantly transforming his position and thoughts. Especially in this great era where "one day equals twenty years," if one does not quickly transform oneself, one will not be able to keep up with the development of the social situation and will be far behind the times. Now, due to the existence of bourgeois thoughts and viewpoints, I often feel that my thoughts often lag behind the development of the Great Leap Forward situation and cannot meet the requirements of the country and the people for me. Therefore, in order to adapt to the needs of the continued Great Leap Forward situation, in the future I must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in labor, thoroughly transform the bourgeois stand and world outlook, establish the idea of serving socialism, and work hard to study business to better serve the people.

Our great motherland is so beautiful. But we have not forgotten that imperialism is still trying to undermine our great socialist construction at all times, and American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, which is completely intolerable. We must heighten our vigilance, defend our great socialist construction, continue to adhere to the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan.

    人民群众冲天干劲教育着我
    黄育贤委员的发言
    一个资产阶级旧知识分子只有在共产党的领导下，只有置身于人民群众之间，不断改造自己的立场和思想，才有可能发挥微小的力量，为人民做出贡献。主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席的报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理在全国人民代表大会二届二次会议上的报告。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们伟大的祖国已昂首阔步地跨入了二十世纪的六十年代，并以史无前例的速度迅速向前发展。在我们的面前，已经出现了多少年来人民梦寐以求的盛景，展开了一幅极其宏伟壮丽的美好画案，这是令人无比地欢欣和鼓舞的。
    现在，我仅就大跃进以来我国水利水电建设的情况，以及个人的一些体会简单谈一谈。
    大跃进以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国范围内，已接连掀起了三次水利建设高潮。广大的人民群众，在共产党的正确领导下，鼓起冲天的干劲，以叫高山低头、河水让路的英雄气概，向大自然展开了大举进攻，经过三年来的努力，我们已经取得极其辉煌的成就。去冬今春广大的人民群众积极响应共产党的号召，深入地反右倾，不断地鼓干劲，因而这第三次水利高潮就开展得更为气势磅礴，波澜壮阔。在高潮顶峰时，全国有七千余万人参加了这一宏伟的水利建设。到目前为止，全国兴建的水利工程达三百八十多万处，完成了土石方二百七十多亿方，扩大和改善灌溉面积达二亿九千万亩。有无数的大、中型水库、渠道工程都正在积极修建。
    兴修起来的水利工程，已经发挥了巨大的效益。去年是我国解放以来自然灾害最严重的一年，有近六亿五千万亩土地受到了不同程度的水旱灾害。但是由于人民公社发挥了巨大的威力，兴修了水利，进行了艰巨的斗争，终于战胜了灾害，夺取了丰收，胜利实现了继续大跃进。
    大跃进以来的水电建设事业，也在和水利建设并驾齐驱，飞跃前进。1959年全国水电超额完成了国家计划，在全国各大河流上都有大型水电站在积极修建，无论就建设规模和速度来说都是空前的。
    随着我国水利水电建设事业的大跃进、大发展，在水利水电科学技术上也得到了飞跃的发展，积累了极其丰富的经验。如各种当地材料坝（包括土坝、砂卵石坝、堆砌石坝等）及轻型坝（包括大头坝、拱坝、平板坝等）的应用和推广，在黄河、汉江大河流上截断河流的成功，采用定向大爆破和水中倒土筑坝的推广和应用，还有在砂卵石基础中采用灌浆和灌筑混凝土截水墙的基础处理方法等等，都极大程度地丰富了我国水利水电科学技术经验的宝库，节约了大量的建筑材料和资金，也不断地加快建设速度。
    现在，在中国共产党和毛主席的伟大号召下，一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在水利水电战线上迅速开展，形成了一个新的高潮，出现了许许多多的新事物、新机具。最近辽宁省沈阳勘测设计院全体职工，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，大举向“四化”进军，大搞计算电气化、设计表格化、绘图印刷化、常用资料手册化，提前了三百三十一天于2月4日就完成了全年计划。甘肃省引洮工程六万民工大闹技术革命，全部工序已经实现了土机械化，使工效成倍、以至成十倍、成百倍地提高。
    1958年以来，我国经济建设事业的持续大跃进，充分显示了总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三大法宝的无比威力。从我国水利水电建设的大跃进中，我深深地体会到只有中国共产党的领导下，才有可能进行这样空前的建设事业，取得这样辉煌的成就，“千条万条共产党的领导是第一条”这确是颠扑不破的真理。同时，我还深深体会到只有人民群众才是世界的主人，只有劳动才能创造世界。正是由于亿万人民在共产党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，才能完成这翻天复地改造自然的伟大事业。几年来，由于工作的关系，我经常出差到各个水利水电建设工地去，看到在各个工地上千万职工的忘我劳动热情，奋不顾身的战斗精神，和你追我赶、你学我帮的热火朝天竞赛高潮景象，以及各工地中共党委领导同志坚韧不拔的工作精神，勤劳朴素的工作作风，都使我受到了很大的教育。有的水利工程，上千万土方的大坝，在一年内建到了拦洪高程，胜利拦住了洪水。这些在水利水电建设上都是奇迹似地出现了。没有共产党的领导，没有广大人民群众为完成社会主义建设的雄心壮志和艰苦奋斗，是根本不可能实现的。
    从这里我也深深体会到一个资产阶级旧知识分子，只有在共产党的领导下，只有置身于人民群众之间，不断地改造自己的立场和思想，才有可能发挥出自己的微小力量，为人民作出贡献。尤其是在这“一天等于二十年”的伟大年代里，如果不迅速地改造自己，就会跟不上社会形势的发展，就会远远地被抛在时代的后面。现在，由于我尚有资产阶级思想和观点的存在，经常感到自己的思想常常落后于大跃进形势的发展，满足不了国家和人民对我的要求，因此，为了适应继续大跃进的形势需要，今后我一定要认真学习毛主席的著作，积极地参加劳动，以彻底改造资产阶级立场和世界观，树立为社会主义服务的思想，并努力钻研业务，以更好地为人民服务。
    我们伟大的祖国是如此的美好。但是我们也没有忘记帝国主义仍然是无时无刻地不在企图破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，美帝国主义还占据着我国的领土台湾，这完全不能令人容忍的。我们一定要提高警惕，保卫我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，继续坚持对国内外敌人的斗争，为解放台湾而努力。
