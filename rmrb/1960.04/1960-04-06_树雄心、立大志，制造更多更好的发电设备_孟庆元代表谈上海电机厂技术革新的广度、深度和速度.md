Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget draft, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    Based on the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the first year of the sixties has brought forward a larger and more comprehensive national economic plan. I firmly believe that, encouraged by the new situation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, we will surely be able to victoriously overfulfill this grand plan.
    In the high tide of the technical revolution movement, the slogan of all the staff and workers of our Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant is: Embark on a new stage, accept new tasks, and make new contributions. This great storm of technical revolution, centered on the mechanization and automation of manual operations, swept the entire factory in just a few days. Its momentum, speed of development, scope of mobilization, concentration of combat goals, number of innovations, and significance of results greatly exceeded the breadth, depth, and speed of the previous stage of technical innovation and technical revolution movement in our factory. It made the production outlook "new with each passing day," and production efficiency increased by multiples, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times. The annual plan for semi-mechanization and mechanization was achieved ahead of schedule after more than thirty days of hard work by all comrades in the factory. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization (including semi-automation and automation) in the factory has increased from 49% at the beginning of February to more than 92%. A total of forty-six automatic production lines and automatic assembly lines have been built, and more than two hundred single machines have achieved automation. As of March 20, the entire factory had submitted 7,352 innovation proposals, of which 4,285 have been implemented, saving more than 1,300 laborers annually. The great storm of technical revolution has driven even greater leaps in production. In the first quarter of this year, the factory comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks every month. The output of the four major products, including steam turbine generators, AC motors, DC motors, and transformers, was equivalent to about five months' output during the continuing Great Leap Forward of 1959.
    The prairie fire of this technical revolution movement was first ignited by an old worker in the shearing and punching workshop who developed a simple automated device. The Party promptly spread this spark of revolution to the entire workshop and brought it to the coil workshop, where manual operations were most numerous, and the cold working workshop, where manual labor was most arduous. The soaring enthusiasm of these two workshops in fundamentally changing the production outlook at high speed gave a huge impact to the shearing and punching workshop and the entire factory. Thus, the raging fire of technical revolution quickly spread throughout the factory.
    The shearing and punching workshop is one of the advanced workshops in our factory, processing iron core stampings and stamped and sheet metal parts for the finished product workshops in the factory. Although there is special equipment for processing, there are many auxiliary workers, the labor intensity is high, and accidents are prone to occur in production. Encouraged by the new stage and new situation, the workers held the strong desire to always be ahead in the advanced workshop, to increase production without increasing manpower or even reducing it, and therefore urgently demanded to change the backward production outlook. Old worker Guan Jinsheng was the first to take practical action to make this change. He used four old iron rings, a piece of scrap iron, and four old rollers to make an automatic silicon steel sheet straightening rack, saving one laborer for straightening the stampings. Originally, he and his apprentice were in charge of a six-foot shearing lathe together, with one standing to cut the material and the other squatting to straighten the material. From then on, the two could be divided into two shifts to work. Many comrades were greatly inspired by this automated device made of old iron rings and scrap iron pieced together into a broken frame. However, some comrades believed that automation meant pressing buttons, watching meters, materials going in, and finished products coming out. The workshop Party branch then held an on-site meeting, launched a debate on advanced versus elementary automation, supported new sprouts, broke down mystical views, inspired creative spirit, and established a shortcut to advance towards mechanization and automation in a way that was more, faster, better, and more economical. All workers in the workshop were mobilized. The technical personnel of the workshop designed a 120-ton pressure large punch press for the sheet metal workers, wanting to use stamping processing to replace the hammer knocking to manufacture sheet metal single pieces. The sheet metal class workers deal with hammers all day long, and they have long had a strong desire to change the heavy manual labor. However, the punch press designed by the technical personnel required more than ten tons of steel, and also needed to make a complete set of large and small molds. Manufacturing the punch press would rely on others, the date of its birth was far away, and the installation place was also a problem. The workers overturned this plan that did not conform to the actual situation, relied on their own efforts, pieced together old materials, and created a soil flanging machine under the form of "three combinations", giving play to collective wisdom. The production efficiency increased sharply by five times, and they got rid of the heavy hammers from then on. The debate on elementary versus advanced automation, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the emphasis on indigenous methods, and the debate on greed for foreign and large scale, was actually a debate on whether or not to carry out mass movement in the technical revolution, and a debate on whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, or less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. After ideological obstacles were broken through, the fire of technical revolution also spread rapidly in the shearing and punching workshop, and a lively revolutionary situation of "every process has improvement, every machine tool has great innovation" appeared. Within a week, the production capacity increased sharply by one time, and 95% of the manual operations were mechanized, semi-automated, and automated. This place is both a production workshop and a technical revolution exhibition. The Party committee of our factory seized the seedling of the new things in time, held an on-site meeting in this workshop, widely spread their advanced thinking and revolutionary spirit. The technical revolution fire of shearing and punching workshop quickly led to burning the coil workshop where manual operation accounted for 70%. This workshop has long emphasized the "five mores", namely: more female workers (more than 60%), more mothers, more illiterates, more apprentices, and more sick people; and "two less", namely: less machinery and equipment, less technical workers, cannot engage in revolution; and thought that manual coil wrapping is a traditional craft at all times and in all countries, and it is also the case for others, and it is very difficult to "reform." This technical revolution fire burned away this kind of "condition theory," inferiority complex and the thought of not believing in the masses. Cadres and the masses all said that if shearing and punching could do it, the coil workshop could also do it, if men could do it, women could also do it. What are the conditions? Sufficient drive is an important condition, being "poor" than others, poverty leads to change, this is also an important condition. Thus, the workshop put forward a slogan that shocked the entire factory: "Set off a climax in three days, change the outlook in a week, overcome technical barriers in ten days, and catch up with Workshop Four (shearing and punching) in two weeks." The female workers all became Mu Guiying, relying on their own efforts, striving for foreign aid, and breaking through the manual operation barrier. Although they did not know how to design drawings, or use lathes, planers, and milling machines, they had a strong desire to liberate their hands and thoroughly emancipate themselves technically. Many "old conditions" that had long existed around them now played a new and significant role. Many mothers invited their husbands to help; and invited brother workshops to cooperate and support. Originally, it was thought that mothers had children, which were a burden, and could not participate in making revolution. Li Lanying is the mother of six children, she arranged her family very well, actively participated in innovation, and became a new role model for everyone to learn from. In less than a week, they manufactured twenty-two coil wrapping machines of seven different structures, and the degree of mechanization in the entire workshop quickly increased from 30% to 86%. Among them, the winding section with the most female workers, the manual operation decreased rapidly from 80% to 8%, and all the wrapping tables that had been with them for many years were thrown out of the workshop. In the past, the crowd was dense, but now the machines are humming together.
    The fire of revolution in the coil workshop also burned back to the shearing and punching workshop, and developed from manual mechanization and single-machine automation to the revolution of the entire production line. The mass adjustment of the process route took only three days, and basically established ten assembly lines, which caused new changes in the outlook of the workshop. Among them, two automatic assembly lines saved seventy laborers.
    This great storm of technical revolution has driven the cold working workshop, which was originally in an intermediate state. They used waste materials and unexpectedly created an automatic assembly line for transformer oil pipes in a few days, increasing the production efficiency by seventy-one times at once, and reducing the number of fixed production workers (excluding temporary workers) from forty-seven to three.
    The technical revolution fire spread to every workshop and every corner of the factory. The workers praised the production assembly line so affectionately:
    Automatic production assembly line, labor wisdom is better than gods,
    Indigenous methods show power, more, faster, better, and more economical are all realized;
    We love the assembly line, every line is a happy line;
    Product processing is as fast as electricity, communism is in sight.
    Countless figures like "Zhuge Liang" and "Newton" emerged in the movement. They were all "innovation enthusiasts," obsessed with creation in order to realize their ambitions, thinking hard, forgetting to eat and sleep, dreaming about it, and vowing not to give up until they achieved their goals; thinking about it while eating, thinking about it while walking, thinking about it while going to the toilet, thinking about it while sleeping in bed, dreaming about innovation, and taking technical revolution as the most pleasant thing in life. They sought inspiration from the ordinary phenomena that appeared around them millions of times in order to realize their ideas. Young worker Xu Dingnan could not fall asleep at night for a technical innovation difficulty, and occasionally found that the comrades sleeping in the bed turned over, causing the iron pad to stretch and contract. He was inspired, immediately got up to draw a sketch; the next day he went to the workshop and created an automatic center correction adjuster. Old worker Chen Shujin failed many times in the experiment to achieve automatic material rectification and lacked a method. On the way through the children's primary school, he saw the children swinging, he immediately ran back to the factory, according to the principle of inertia, made an automatic material rectification rack for the eight-foot shearing lathe with two pieces of waste iron skin, saving one laborer. There is a female worker in the coil workshop named Zhu Shude, who is usually called "four no-comes" by others: she can't speak, she can't live fast, she can't use her brains, and she can't come back from the city. This so-called "stupid person" has also become a "Zhuge Liang" this time. She proposed and implemented two major technological innovation projects, which gave everyone great inspiration and encouragement.
    "One person has difficulties, ten thousand people help together", relying on collective strength to overcome technical key, has become a common atmosphere in the whole factory. When the coil workshop fought a big battle against manual operation, the workshops jointly shouted the touching slogan of "open a green light for the coil workshop", helping the female workers to rush to make parts. When the shearing and punching workshop struggled for ten production lines, more than 300 workers in the tool workshop, day and night, rushed to make more than 5,000 parts, and so on. This communist collective spirit, the communist style of selflessness for the public and forgetting the self, influenced and promoted each other. The profound changes in the ideological outlook of the people play an immeasurable role in this technical revolution movement. The Party committee of our factory promptly excavated new people and new things in the movement, widely publicized and promoted them, and continuously injected new blood into the movement. Late at night, when the cold working workshop was engaged in the automatic assembly line for transformer oil pipes at the most critical juncture, the chains used for transmission were not long enough, they could not be received, they could not be borrowed, and they could not be found in the waste pile. What to do? Three old workers disassembled the chains on their bicycles and installed them. One of them was called Yu Xianglin, who was a bit lame due to a foot injury and it was inconvenient for him to go home. Others persuaded him not to disassemble, he said: "Building socialism and communism is the happiness of future generations, what is a chain? As long as it is needed, I can take out everything." The changes in the production outlook have led to the progress of many comrades.
    In this technical revolution movement, the masses have further developed the spirit of continuous revolution. They are not satisfied with the existing technological revolution achievements, but want more, faster, better, and more economical. The windbreak rolling machine of the sheet metal class in the shearing and punching workshop has been improved 31 times, from rolling single edges to rolling double edges, from manual tightening to automatic tightening, from manual operation mechanization to semi-automation. The coil wrapping machine in the coil workshop has also been improved countless times, from wrapping one circle of mica tape each time to wrapping four circles each time, from wrapping in one direction to wrapping back and forth, and canceling the arc mold and so on. The rotor joint of the new steam turbine generator has been successful after 34 different structures and more than 130 repeated tests. Because the thought of continuous revolution has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, is firmly grasped by every comrade, and has become an endless creative force to promote the continuous development of technological revolution. The workers say well: technological revolution is more and more revolutionary, and people are getting smarter and smarter.
    This technical revolution movement further implemented the system of three combinations. After the movement began, the Party committee timely organized all the technical personnel in the factory to go to the workshop, participate in physical labor, and help the workers realize their ideas, so that they were once again deeply educated. Many vivid examples in the technical revolution movement made us ideologically realize that: the workers have both the ambition to transform nature and the endless wisdom to achieve a revolutionary conscious requirement to quickly realize socialist communism and to resolutely discard backward operations. It is an example of self-transformation of engineering and technical personnel in this revolutionary practice. The technical personnel not only participated in the discussion but also drew engineering sketches, and worked with the workers until the realization; on the other hand, the mechanization and automation of production also reflected the requirements of product structure, manufacturing technology and parts standardization, and put forward directions for the future work of technical personnel. This vigorous and large-scale technical revolution movement not only changed the production outlook, but also further strengthened the relationship between workers and technical personnel. Everyone worked side by side day and night, made changes while doing, and the feelings became more harmonious. The workers affectionately called the technical personnel working together as master craftsmen, and the technical personnel considered this an honor. The comrades working in the workshop worked hard day and night, and the workers were afraid that they would not rest well, and constantly cared and urged them to go to sleep. They are heart-to-heart with each other, what better words can describe this deep feeling?
    Although our factory has made some achievements in the technical revolution movement since this year, there are still some imbalances. The factory Party committee has timely pointed out these problems, and put forward that the future technical revolution movement should develop towards consolidation, improvement, wide and deep development, both carrying out mass movements and combining with improving enterprise management; both focusing on the current key to production and combining with long-term technological transformation plans; both realizing manual operation mechanization and automation and advancing to high, sharp, and sophisticated products. We must strengthen the study of Mao Zedong's works, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, be heart-to-heart with the workers, share the same fate with production, continuously transform ourselves, hold high the red flag of the general line, foster great ambitions and lofty goals, contribute our strength to the continued Great Leap Forward, and strive to manufacture more and larger power generation equipment in the future.

    树雄心、立大志，制造更多更好的发电设备
    孟庆元代表谈上海电机厂技术革新的广度、深度和速度主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    在史无前例的1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进的基础上，六十年代第一年，提出了一个更大更全面的国民经济计划，我坚信在新形势鼓舞下，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下和全国人民努力下，一定能够胜利地超额完成这个宏伟的计划。
    在技术革命运动的高潮中，我们上海电机厂全体职工的口号是：踏上新阶段，接受新任务，作出新贡献。这个以手工操作机械化和自动化为中心的技术革命运动大风暴，在短短的几天内就席卷全厂，其声势之大，发展之快，动员之广，战斗目标之集中，创造革新之多，效果之显著，都大大超过了我厂前一阶段技术革新和技术革命运动的广度、深度和速度。使生产面貌“时新日异”，生产效率成倍、几十倍乃至成百倍地提高。全年的半机械化和机械化规划，经过全厂同志三十余天奋战，提前实现了。目前全厂机械化和半机械化（包括半自动化和自动化）程度，已从2月初的49％提高到92％以上，共建成了四十六条自动生产线和自动流水生产线，二百多个单机实现了自动化。到3月20日止，全厂共提出了革新建议七千三百五十二项，已实现的四千二百八十五项，全年可节省劳动力一千三百人以上。技术革命大风暴推动着生产更大的跃进，今年第一季度，全厂月月全面超额完成生产任务，汽轮发电机、交流电动机、直流电机和变压器等四大品种完成了相当于继续大跃进的1959年五个月左右的产量。
    这场技术革命运动的燎原烈火，首先是从剪冲车间一个老工人搞简易自动化装置开始燃起星星之火的。党及时把这颗革命火种撒到整个车间，同时把它带到手工操作最多的线圈车间，和体力劳动最繁重的冷作车间里。这两个车间用高速度基本改变生产面貌的冲天干劲，又给剪冲车间和全厂以巨大影响，于是技术革命熊熊烈火就迅速地燃遍全厂。
    剪冲车间是我厂先行车间之一，为全厂各成品车间加工电机和变压器上的铁心冲片和冲压、板金零件。加工虽有专用设备，但辅助工人多，劳动强度高，生产上易出事故。工人们在新阶段新形势的鼓舞下，对先行车间永远先行，增产不增人甚至减少人，抱着强烈的愿望，因此迫切要求改变落后的生产面貌。老工人管金生第一个用实际行动来进行这种改变。他用四根旧铁元，一块烂铁板，四只旧滚轮，做成了一台矽钢片自动整料架，节省了一个整理冲片的劳动力，他们师徒二人本来共管一台六尺剪刀车床，一个立着剪料一个蹲着整料，从此两人可以分成两班干活了。很多同志从这个旧铁元、烂铁皮、拼成一个破框框的自动化装置中受到极大启发。但也有少数同志认为，按电钮、看仪表，材料进去、成品出来，这才是自动化。车间党支部紧接着召开了现场会议，开展对自动化的高级与低级之争，扶持新生萌芽，大破神秘观点，启发创造精神，确立了一条多快好省向机械化自动化进军的捷径，全车间人人动作起来。车间技术人员为板金工设计了一台一百二十吨压力的大冲床，想用冲压加工代替鎯头敲打制造板金单件。板金班工人是成天和鎯头打交道的，他们早就存在着改变繁重的体力劳动的强烈愿望。但技术人员设计的这台冲床，需要十多吨钢材，还要做一整套大大小小的冲模，制造冲床要依靠别人，出世日期遥遥无期，安装地方也成问题。工人们就推翻了这个不符合现实情况的方案，自力更生，在“三结合”的形式下，发挥集体智慧，用旧料东拼西凑，创造了一台土滚边机，生产效率猛增五倍，并从此掼掉了笨重的鎯头。自动化的低级与高级之争，土洋结合，以土为主与贪洋就大之争，实际上是技术革命要不要搞群众运动之争，是多快好省与少慢差费之争。思想障碍冲破后，技术革命的烈火也就在剪冲车间迅速蔓延开来，一个“道道工序有改进，台台机床大革新”的生动革命局面出现了，一周之内，生产能力猛增一倍，95％的手工操作实现了机械化、半自动化和自动化。这里既是生产车间，又是技术革命展览会。我厂党委就抓住新事物苗头，及时在这个车间里召开现场会议，广泛传播他们的先进思想，革命精神。把剪冲车间的技术革命大火很快地引烧到手工操作占70％的线圈车间。这个车间长期以来强调“五多”，即：女工多（60％以上）、妈妈多、文盲多、艺徒多、病号多；“二少”，即：机器设备少、技术工人少，不能闹革命；并且认为线圈包扎手工，是古今中外的传统工艺，人家也是如此，要“革”困难很多。这次技术革命燎原大火烧掉了这种“唯条件论”、自卑感和不相信群众的思想。干部和群众都说，剪冲能干，线圈车间也能干，男的能干，女的也能干。什么是条件？干劲足就是重要的条件，比人家“穷”，穷则思变，这也是一个重要的条件。于是车间里提出了一个震动全厂的口号：“三天掀高潮，一周改面貌，十天攻克技术关，二周赶上四（剪冲）车间。”女工们人人成为穆桂英，自力更生，争取外援，大破手工操作关。他们虽然不会设计绘图，不会车、钳、刨、铣，但是，由于要求解放双手在技术上彻底翻身的强烈愿望，许多久已存在于她们周围的“老条件”，这时都发出新的巨大作用。许多妈妈请来了自己的丈夫帮忙；请兄弟车间协作支援，原来以为妈妈有孩子，受牵累，不能参加闹革命。李兰英是六个孩子的妈妈，把家里安排得很好，积极参加革新，成为大家学习的新榜样。在不到一星期时间内，他们制造了七种不同结构的二十二部线圈包扎机，全车间机械化程度从30％迅速地提高到86％。其中女工最多的旋绕工段，手工操作从80％降低到8％，把那多年相伴的包扎台全部扔出了车间。过去人群密集，现在已是群机齐鸣。
    线圈车间的革命烈火又回烧到了剪冲车间，从手工机械化和单机自动化发展到整条生产线的革命，群众性的调整工艺路线，只用三天时间，基本上建立了十条流水生产线，使车间面貌又起了新的变化。其中两条自动流水线，就节省了劳动力七十人。
    这场技术革命大风暴带动了本来处于中间状态的冷作车间，他们利用废旧材料，以几天时间完全出人意料地创造了一条变压器油管自动流水生产线，生产效率一下子提高了七十一倍，固定生产工人（临时工除外）从四十七人减为三人。
    技术革命燎原大火烧遍了全厂每个车间，烧到了全厂每个角落。工人们这样亲切地歌颂生产流水线：
    自动生产流水线，劳动智慧胜神仙，
    土法上马显威风，多快好省全实现；
    我们热爱流水线，条条都是幸福线；
    产品加工快如电，共产主义在眼前。
    运动中涌现了无数个像“诸葛亮”和“牛顿”这样的人物。他们都是“革新迷”，为了实现雄心壮志，迷于创造，穷思苦想，废寝忘食，梦寐以求，不达目的，誓不罢休；吃饭想、走路想、上厕所想、睡在床上也想、做梦也梦到革新，把技术革命作为人生最大愉快的事情。他们从千万次出现在自己周围的普通现象中求得启发，以实现自己的设想。青年工人许定南为了一个革新难关，深夜在床上翻来复去睡不着，偶而发现在床上睡觉的同志翻身使铁垫条一伸一缩，他受到了启发，立刻起来画好草图；第二天到车间就搞成了一个自动中心校调器。老工人陈书金，为了搞整料自动化，多次试验失败，缺乏办法，途经子女小学，看见孩子们正在荡秋千，他立刻奔回厂中，根据惯性原理，用两条废铁皮做成了八尺剪刀车床的自动整料架，节省了一个劳动力。线圈车间有个女工叫朱淑德，平日别人叫她“四不来”：讲话讲不来、生活快不来、脑筋动不来、去市区回不来。这个所谓“笨人”，这次也变成了“诸葛亮”。她提出并实现了两项重大技术革新项目，给大家启发鼓舞极大。
    “一人有困难，万人齐支援”，依靠集体力量攻克技术关键，已成为全厂普遍的风气了。当线圈车间大战手工操作关时，各车间共同喊出了“为线圈车间开绿灯”的动人口号，帮助女工们赶制零件。当剪冲车间奋战十条生产线时，工具车间三百多个工人，不分日夜，赶制了五千多个零件等等。这种共产主义集体精神，舍己为公、公而忘私的共产主义风格相互影响，相互促进。人的思想面貌的深刻变化，对这次技术革命运动，起着不可估量的作用。我厂党委及时发掘运动中的新人新事，广泛宣传推广，给运动不断注射新的血液。深夜，冷作车间搞变压器油管自动流水生产线到最紧张关头时，传动用的链条不够长，领也领不到，借也借不到，废料堆中也找不到。怎么办？三个老工人不约而同地把自己脚踏车上的链条拆下来装上去了。其中一个叫俞祥林，因脚受伤有点跛，回家不方便，别人劝他不要拆，他说：“建设社会主义、共产主义是子孙万代的幸福，一根链条算得了什么？只要需要，我什么都可拿出来。”生产面貌的变化，带动了很多同志的进步。
    在这次技术革命运动中，群众进一步发扬了不断革命精神。他们丝毫不满足于已有技术革命成就，而是多了还要多，快了还要快，好了还要好，省了还要省。剪冲车间板金班的档风板滚边机，经过了三十一次改进，从滚单边到滚双边，从手工压紧到自动压紧，从手工操作机械化到半自动化。线圈车间线圈包扎机，也经过了无数次改进，从每次包一圈云母带到每次包四圈，从单一方向包到来回都能包，并取消弧模等。新型汽轮发电机的转子接头，经过不同的三十四种结构，一百三十多次反复试验才成功的。由于不断革命思想已深入人心，为每个同志所紧紧掌握，成为推动技术革命不断向前发展的无穷无尽的创造力量。工人们说得好：技术革命是愈革愈多的，人是愈革愈聪明的。
    这次技术革命运动进一步实行了三结合的制度。运动一开始后，党委及时组织了全厂技术人员下车间，参加体力劳动，帮助工人实现设想，使自己也再一次受到了深刻的教育。技术革命运动中的许多生动事例，使我们在思想上认识到：为了迅速实现社会主义共产主义的一种革命自觉要求和坚决丢掉落后操作的切身体验，工人同志既具有改造自然的雄心壮志，又具有无穷无尽的智慧。它是工程技术人员在这次革命实践中自我改造的榜样。技术人员不但参与讨论而且把一张张工程草图绘制出来，一直同工人一起工作到实现为止；另一方面，生产上的机械化和自动化又反映出产品结构，制造工艺和零部件标准化的要求，为技术人员的今后工作提出了方向。这一次轰轰烈烈的大规模技术革命运动，不但改变了生产面貌，同时也进一步密切了工人与技术人员之间的感情，大家通过彼此之间日日夜夜并肩作战，边做边改，感情更加融洽了。工人亲密称呼一起工作的技术人员为老师傅，技术人员认为这是一个荣誉。下车间工作的同志日夜苦战，工人怕他们不肯好好地休息，不断关心，劝他们去睡觉。他们彼此之间心连着心，还有什么好的词句可以形容这种深厚的感情呢？
    今年以来虽然我厂在技术革命运动中取得了一些成绩，但还存在着一些不平衡现象。厂党委已及时指出这些问题，并提出了今后技术革命运动向巩固提高和广泛深入方面发展，既要大搞群众运动，又要与改进企业管理相结合；既要以当前生产关键为主，又要与长期技术改造规划相结合；既要实现手工操作机械化自动化，又要向高尖精产品进军。我们一定要加强学习毛泽东著作，以毛泽东思想武装自己，与工人心连心，同生产共命运，不断改造自己，高举总路线红旗，树雄心大志，为持续大跃进贡献自己的力量，为今后制造更多更大的发电设备而奋斗。
