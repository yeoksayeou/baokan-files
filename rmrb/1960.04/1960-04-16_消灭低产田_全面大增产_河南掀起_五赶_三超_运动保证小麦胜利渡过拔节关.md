Xinhua News Agency Report:

    In the current wheat field management campaign, the vast rural areas of Henan Province, with a spirit of tightly interlocked links, have launched a province-wide wheat overproduction competition campaign with the theme of "Five Catch-Ups" (mountainous areas catching up with plains, distant fields catching up with nearby fields, late-sown fields catching up with early-sown fields, lean fields catching up with fertile fields, and third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings) and "Three Surpasses" (enthusiasm surpassing measures, measures surpassing targets, and actual output surpassing plans) to ensure that wheat successfully passes the jointing stage.
    Wheat is growing very well in Henan Province this year. Although the province suffered another hundred-day drought from the beginning of wheat sowing last year to mid-March this year, following the hundred-day drought last autumn, wheat successfully passed the wintering and greening stages due to the meticulous management of the masses. According to the latest wheat seedling assessment in the province, first-class seedlings cover 25 million mu, accounting for more than 30% of the wheat field area, with an average of 800,000 to 1 million tillers per mu; second-class seedlings cover 45 million mu, accounting for about 54%, with 600,000 tillers per mu; and third-class seedlings cover 13 million mu, accounting for 15%, with 300,000 to 400,000 tillers per mu. With the good growth of wheat seedlings, the broad masses in the province are full of confidence in striving for a bumper wheat harvest and have further launched the "Five Catch-Ups" and "Three Surpasses" campaign. In the Xinyang Special District, 85% of the production teams have revised their overproduction plans, increased production-boosting measures, and strived to increase production by another 10% on the basis of the original plan. After formulating overproduction plans, the counties in the Nanyang Special District launched a vigorous upsurge to eliminate low-yield areas and third-class seedlings, and to strengthen mid-term management of wheat fields.
    In order to firmly grasp and meticulously address weak links, and eliminate low-yield fields and third-class seedlings during the jointing and booting stage, all regions have strengthened leadership over low-yield areas and third-class seedlings. The three special districts of Nanyang, Xinyang, and Xuchang have transferred a total of 30,000 cadres from the special districts, counties, and communes, and more than 3.4 million laborers to specifically manage wheat fields, from now until wheat harvest. In order to eliminate third-class seedlings, the Nanyang County Party Committee put forward the slogan: "First-class seedlings will always occupy the first place, second-class seedlings will closely follow, and third-class seedlings will all change their appearance." The county has implemented four specializations (specialized leadership, specialized technical personnel, establishment of specialized scientific research institutes, and specialized labor management), so that more than 170,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the county quickly decreased to more than 80,000 mu.
    The province-wide water conservancy construction campaign, combining long-term drought resistance with drilling deep wells and building mechanical irrigation and drainage stations, is developing vigorously towards mountainous and hilly areas. Following the establishment of the first million-mu mechanical well area in the plain area, the Nanyang Special District is now establishing a million-mu mechanical well area on the terraced area, fundamentally solving the water conservancy and irrigation problems in the terraced area. After popularizing the experience of drilling wells in the Mangshan area of Mengjin County, Luoyang Special District, a surge of drilling wells has been set off in the hilly area of the entire district. More than 1,000 mechanical wells have now been completed, and more than 4,800 are under construction. In the third-class wheat field area, Biyang County, Nanyang Special District, has built more than 6,320 large and small canals, with a total length of more than 15,070 li, drilled 147 mechanical wells, and established 34 mechanical irrigation stations, basically realizing gravity irrigation and a double insurance system of wells and canals in the mountainous areas. In the hilly areas, Meng County, Xinxiang Special District, has also vigorously developed fertilizer bases, built 157 pig and sheep farms, 2,700 manure pools on the field heads, and 13 fertilizer plants, so that 80,000 mu of thin wheat fields in the hilly areas that did not apply fertilizer or rarely applied fertilizer in previous years have been fertilized two to three times. In the hilly areas with poor soil quality, Biyang County, Nanyang Special District, has vigorously developed basic fertilizer construction, forming a complete comprehensive fertilizer network, accumulating 1.7 billion jin of coarse fertilizer and 1.67 million jin of various chemical fertilizers.
    In the "Five Catch-Ups" and "Three Surpasses" campaign, the vast rural commune members have fully demonstrated the superiority of the people's communes and the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation. The atmosphere of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" has spread throughout the province, making the current wheat field management movement a thriving, hand-in-hand, and advancing-side-by-side great situation everywhere, whether in mountainous or plain areas. In Xinyang Special District, all communes carried out the "three helps" activities of advanced teams and wealthy teams helping backward teams and poor teams with labor, tools, and materials. In the entire district, 218 nearby brigades were organized to help 312 backward brigades with 16,360 laborers, 13,450 tools, and 5,654 jin of chemical fertilizers, under the principles of equal exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit.

    消灭低产田　全面大增产
    河南掀起“五赶”“三超”运动保证小麦胜利渡过拔节关
    据新华社讯　河南省广大农村在当前麦田管理运动中，以环环扣紧的精神，在全省掀起了一个以“五赶”（山区赶平原、远地赶近地、晚茬赶早茬、瘦田赶肥田、三类苗赶一类苗）、“三超”（干劲超措施、措施超指标、实产超计划）为内容的小麦超产竞赛运动，保证小麦胜利渡过拔节关。
    河南省今年小麦生长非常好，全省虽由去年麦播开始到今年3月中旬为止，遭遇了继去秋百日大旱之后，又一个百日大旱，但是由于广大群众精心管理，小麦胜利渡过了越冬关和返青关。据最近全省麦苗站队的情况看，一类苗二千五百万亩，占麦田面积30％以上，平均每亩分蘖八十万株到一百万株左右；二类苗四千五百万亩，占54％左右，每亩分蘖六十万株；三类苗一千三百万亩，占15％，每亩分蘖三十万到四十万株。在麦苗生长良好的情况下，全省广大群众对争取小麦大丰收的信心十足。进一步开展了“五赶”、“三超”运动。信阳专区有85％的生产队都修订了超产计划，增加增产措施，力争全区在原计划的基础上，再增产一成。南阳专区各县在制定超产计划以后，全区展开了如火如荼的消灭低产区、消灭三类苗，加强麦田中期管理的高潮。
    为了狠抓、细抓薄弱环节，把低产田和三类苗消灭在拔节孕穗关，各个地区都加强对低产区、三类苗的领导。南阳、信阳、许昌三个专区，共抽调专区、县、社三万名干部和三百四十多万劳力专管麦田，从现在一直包管到麦收。南阳县为了消灭三类苗，县委提出：“一类苗永占第一，二类苗紧紧跟上，三类苗全部变样”的口号，全县实现四专（专业领导、专业技术人员、建立专门的科学研究所、专业劳力管理）领导，使全县十七万多亩三类苗，很快下降到八万多亩。
    全省结合长期抗旱，大打机井，大建机械排灌站的水利建设运动正向山区、丘陵区猛烈发展。南阳专区继在平原地区建立了第一个百万亩机井方后，现在又在岗地建立一个岗坡百万亩机井方，根本解决岗坡地区的水利灌溉问题。洛阳专区推广孟津县邙山地区打机井的经验以后，全区岗岭地区掀起了打机井热潮，现在已打成机井一千多眼，正在打的有四千八百多眼。南阳专区泌阳县在三类麦田地区，建成大、小渠道六千三百二十多条，长达一万五千零七十多华里，打机井一百四十七眼，建立机灌站三十四个，基本上实现了山岗灌溉自流化，井渠双保险。新乡专区孟县在丘陵地区还大搞肥料基地，在田头建了一百五十七个猪、羊场，二千七百个地头粪池，十三个化肥厂，使往年不施肥或很少施肥的八万亩丘陵薄地小麦，已施了二遍肥到三遍肥，南阳专区泌阳县在土质瘠薄的丘陵地区，大搞肥料基本建设，形成了一套完整的综合性肥料网，已积粗肥十七亿斤，各种化肥一百六十七万斤。
    在“五赶”、“三超”运动中，广大农村公社社员，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性和共产主义大协作的精神，“学、比、赶、帮”的风气遍及全省，使得当前的麦田管理运动，无论是山区、平原，到处出现了一片蓬蓬勃勃、携手并肩、齐头跃进的大好形势。信阳专区全区各个公社开展先进队、富队对后进队、穷队的帮劳力、帮工具、帮物资的“三帮”活动，全区对三百一十二个后进大队，在等价交换、互助互利的原则下，组织附近二百一十八个大队帮助劳力一万六千三百六十个，工具一万三千四百五十件，化肥五千六百五十四斤。
