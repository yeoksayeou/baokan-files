    A Good Form of Film Review
    "Film review" should not merely be a means for authors to recommend movies to the audience, but also a continuation of propaganda and education for the audience. If a viewer carefully chews on the themes, characters, and plots discussed in the film review after watching a movie, the educational effect will be enhanced. Therefore, we should attach great importance to "film review" work. We not only need writers to write, literary critics to write, and educators to write, but also to let the broad masses of people from all walks of life write; not only individuals, but also collectives. A group of film reviews on the People's Daily supplement on March 15 aroused my interest. It can be seen from this group of film reviews that people in various work positions have been deeply educated by the film and expressed their feelings. What is most noteworthy is the collective creation form of the film review group of the Shanghai Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Workers collectively reviewing movies is a new thing. It has many advantages, because everyone has to discuss before writing, express their feelings, and supplement each other, so they can inspire each other, improve understanding, receive universal education, and also improve their ability to appreciate film art. This form is obviously also welcomed by the majority of readers.

    一种好的影评形式
    “影评”不应当仅仅是作为作者向观众们推荐电影的手段，同时还应该是对观众进行宣传教育的一个继续。一个观众如果看了一部电影以后，再细心地咀嚼影评中论述的主题思想、人物、情节，将会加深受教育的效果。因此，我们应该十分重视“影评”工作。我们不仅需要作家来写、文艺评论家来写、教育家来写，而且要让广大群众、各行各业的人都来写；不单单是个人写，也可以集体写。三月十五日人民日报副刊上有一组影评引起了我的兴趣。从这组影评中可以看出，在各个不同工作岗位上的人，都受到了影片的深刻教育，谈出了自己的感受。其中最引人注意的是上海永大染织一厂影评组的集体创作形式。工人们集体评论电影，这是一件新事物。它的好处很多，由于在写作前大家要讨论一番，各抒感想，互相补充，因此可以互相启发、提高认识，普遍受到教育，也提高了对电影艺术的欣赏能力。这种形式显然也为广大读者所欢迎。
