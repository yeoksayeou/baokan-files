Unleash the Masses to Vigorously Attack the Loading and Unloading Barrier
Chai Zemin, Director of the Transportation Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee

Heavy Tasks, Great Potential

With the high-speed development of the national economy, Beijing's transportation tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. In 1960, the city's freight volume will increase by 54% compared to last year. Although the state is vigorously strengthening the weak links on the railway trunk lines, building the Fengsha (Fengtai to Shacheng) line, actively renovating the Beijing hub station, and adding other necessary equipment, it is estimated that the increase in vehicles will be limited. Therefore, the contradiction between transport volume exceeding transport capacity remains significant. To resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to vigorously promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and continue to tap transportation potential.

According to our analysis, the main potential in transportation work currently lies in the following areas:

First, the backward loading and unloading methods are not compatible with modern transportation tools. Workers say this is "running in the middle, stuck at both ends." Loading and unloading operations mainly rely on heavy manual labor, with long loading and unloading times, low efficiency, and a waste of a large portion of transport capacity. If the city's automobiles could reduce loading and unloading time by half, it would be equivalent to adding about five hundred vehicles; if the loading and unloading turnaround time of trains could be generally reduced by half, it would be equivalent to adding several hundred railcars.

Second, the internal handling processes of factories, mines, enterprises, warehouses, and construction sites occupy a large number of specialized transportation vehicles. According to statistics from three hundred and eighty factories and mines, they occupy four hundred and forty-four automobiles, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight horse-drawn carts, and seven hundred and seventy-three tricycles. If these factories, mines, and enterprises improve their current backward transportation conditions and extract these vehicles for social transportation, they could complete a transport volume of approximately more than fifty thousand tons per day.

Third, promoting the experience of the railway, highway, and enterprise integrated large-scale collaboration centered on the East Suburb Railway Station is an effective measure for tapping transportation potential. Last year, various units in the East Suburb area, under the leadership of the Chaoyang District Party Committee, transformed railway dedicated lines into shared lines and adopted a series of measures such as unified use of loading and unloading forces and door-to-door delivery. The railway loading volume increased by 24.9% compared to 1958, the unloading volume increased by 74.6%, and the highway freight volume increased by 90%. Other districts promoted this experience, and the results were also very significant.

Vigorously Promote Loading and Unloading Mechanization

Based on the above situation, the Municipal Party Committee instructed that we must concentrate our firepower to vigorously attack the loading and unloading barrier, further mobilize factories and mines to operate transportation, and promote the experience of integrated large-scale collaboration. Therefore, we promptly deployed the launch of a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization. We plan to organize three campaigns before May Day to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, and partial continuous automation of loading and unloading operations, accelerate vehicle turnover, greatly improve transportation efficiency, and alleviate the tense transportation situation. The first campaign requires that loading and unloading and handling mechanization and semi-mechanization be basically achieved at the ring road stations, mainly including the five important freight stations of Guang'anmen, East Suburb, Xizhimen, Yongdingmen, and Fengtai. The second campaign requires that factories, mines, warehouses, construction sites, and all dedicated lines in the city basically achieve loading, unloading, and handling mechanization and semi-mechanization, and all professional automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and tricycles occupied by internal handling in factories and mines will be extracted to increase social transportation capacity. The third campaign requires that loading and unloading and handling mechanization and semi-mechanization be fully realized throughout the city, further improve the level of mechanization, and vigorously develop assembly lines. Through the above three campaigns, we will further accelerate vehicle turnover, achieve a doubling of loading and unloading efficiency, a halving of loading and unloading personnel, and eliminate heavy manual labor.

From the transportation front to factories and enterprises, from leading cadres to the broad masses of workers, after twenty days of intense fighting, we victoriously overfulfilled the plan of the first campaign and achieved brilliant results. The level of mechanization at stations such as Guang'anmen, East Suburb, Xizhimen, Fengtai, Yongdingmen, Xibianmen, and Mentougou increased sharply from the original 12.6% to over 70%, and the level of mechanization at the East Suburb Station reached as high as 85%. The loading and unloading efficiency of the above stations has doubled compared to the original, which can reduce more than one thousand five hundred people, accounting for 36% of the original number; after operating skills are further improved, it can be greatly reduced. Old worker Fu Zongwu of Yongdingmen Station praised loading and unloading mechanization and wrote the following poem: "Shoulders pressed for decades, back pain and leg soreness, the Party came to lead us, vigorously promoting mechanization, discarding clubs and mallets, happiness for ten thousand years."

The East Suburb Mechanical Coal Briquette Factory, Changping Sand and Gravel Field, Babaoshan Sand and Gravel Field, and Yongdingmen Grain Depot have formed four integrated semi-automatic transportation assembly lines. These assembly lines enable the entire process of materials from loading at the place of origin to unloading at the processing units and users to be mechanized and semi-automated, greatly accelerating vehicle turnover.

From the characteristics of this campaign, the general conclusion is: two highs and two bigs, that is, high style, high speed, large-scale operations, and large-area harvest.

Four Basic Experiences

The brilliant results achieved in our first campaign to attack the loading and unloading barrier are a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, a victory for the communist style, and a victory for vigorously promoting mass movements. The main experiences that enabled us to achieve a large-area harvest in just twenty days are as follows.

First, strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to putting politics in command. Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over transportation work in the continuous Great Leap Forward. In its reports at the Municipal Industrial Transportation Work Conference and the Municipal Heroes Conference, the Municipal Party Committee made specific and clear instructions on transportation work, proposing to vigorously promote loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization, eliminate heavy manual labor, and achieve "doubling output, halving personnel." Based on this general requirement, we put forward a plan to organize three campaigns before May Day, so that the movement can be carried out with leadership, goals, and in stages. At the same time, we require Party committees at all levels to achieve "five grasps": grasp ideology, grasp planning, grasp organization, grasp measures, and grasp inspection, emphasizing hard work and self-reliance, vigorously promoting communist collaboration, calling on everyone to offer suggestions and ideas, vigorously promoting mass movements, and achieving large-area harvests at high speed. The Party committees of each district resolutely implemented the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, with the secretary taking command, a dedicated person in charge, concentrating forces, and firmly grasping the key of loading and unloading. At the end of January this year, in order to absorb the experience of advanced regions, the Municipal Party Committee organized the responsible comrades of the Party and government of various districts and transportation departments in the city to visit Tianjin. After returning, they quickly launched a wave of "learning from Tianjin and catching up with Tianjin." A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on achieving loading, unloading, and handling mechanization and semi-mechanization was launched on an unprecedented scale.

Second, break down unit boundaries and carry out communist large-scale collaboration. This high-speed capture of the loading and unloading barrier is the result of vigorously promoting the spirit of collaboration. The participants in this innovation struggle, from the perspective of occupation, included workers, office cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, as well as teachers, students, street residents, and members of people's communes; from the perspective of region, there were those from this district, those not from this district, and those who came from Tangshan hundreds of miles away to provide support. This touching scene of actively coming to support is a concrete manifestation of the noble communist style. At a meeting convened by the District Party Committee to study mechanical processing and manufacturing issues, the secretary of the District Party Committee had just put forward the number of mechanical parts that needed to be processed and manufactured, and the heads of various factories and enterprises scrambled to contract tasks and ask for "difficulties." The Jufeng Plumbing Factory, with its simple equipment and only dozens of workers, also unceremoniously "contracted" eleven casting jobs. The leaders believed that their strength was weak and it would be difficult to complete their own tasks, worrying that they would have difficulties, but they said: "Don't worry, we will resolutely complete it!" As a result, both tasks were completed. In the concentrated manufacture of loading and unloading machinery, many factories adopted a combination of workers, cadres, and technicians internally, and a combination of production units, user units, and design units externally, solving many key problems. The materials needed to manufacture loading and unloading machinery were also resolved in communist large-scale collaboration. For example, when comrades from the Materials Supply Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications were picking up goods at Fengtai Station, they saw that the station was vigorously promoting loading and unloading mechanization and lacked some materials. They immediately sent a car to deliver eighty sets of bearings and also supported three hundred kilograms of silicon steel sheets. For the lofty ideal of the communist cause, everyone actively cooperated, which was a magnificent sight.

Third, unleash the masses and vigorously promote mass movements. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees of each district, manpower and material resources were concentrated, and large-scale operations were implemented. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50,000 people participated in the movement. A total of more than 420 units participated in the coordinated operations, and the scope and scale were unprecedented. If it were not for vigorously promoting mass movements, it would be unimaginable to achieve loading and unloading mechanization at high speed.

Experience has proven that vigorously promoting mass movements must be combined with centralized leadership; only by strengthening leadership can the mass movement develop healthily. In the process of vigorously promoting mass movements this time, leaders at all levels have implemented close and vigorous grasps and strengthened detailed organizational work. "Four fixings" were carried out according to the unit: fix the project, fix the indicators, fix the dedicated person, and fix the delivery date. The units participating in the movement reported the progress to the District Party Committee every half day, and the District Party Committee held a large-scale collaboration joint meeting every two days, and also went deep into the grassroots to inspect and guide the work every day, and further developed to three grasps a day. In this way, problems can be solved in a timely manner. A total of twenty factories in Xuanwu District participated in the manufacture of machinery, and they formed a joint operation unit with four main factories as the main body, unified planning, unified action, close cooperation, and division of labor and cooperation, fully reflecting a high degree of organization and discipline, like front-line operations, with each link closely linked and orderly. Experience has also proven that unified command is very important. For this reason, there must be careful deployment, detailed plans, and accurate calculation of time, so that a flow line of operations can be formed between factories, and the upper and lower processes can be connected with each other. The twenty-nine conveyors produced by the Xuanwu Machinery Repair Factory had ten factories processing parts for them. The arrangement of plans and the inspection of production between them were calculated in hours, and the completion time of components and parts was truly grasped, fighting for every second. In order to seize time, the District Party Committee decided to send a batch of tricycles to transport the parts. After a component or batch of parts was made, they were loaded onto tricycles and rushed to the factory responsible for the next process. The tricycles flew back and forth, interspersed and crisscrossed, like sending "copies" between movie theaters.

Due to the combination of vigorously promoting mass movements and centralized leadership, this movement was not only vigorous but also practical, not only large-scale but also orderly.

Fourth, work hard and self-reliantly, and implement the "walking on two legs" policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods. To achieve mechanization, a large number of indigenous and foreign loading and unloading machines must be manufactured, and the first problem encountered is the problem of materials. Each district resolutely broke the mentality of dependence, mobilized the masses to work hard and self-reliantly to solve the material problem, and on the one hand, based on the spirit of adapting to local conditions and using simple materials, tried to save materials as much as possible, and at the same time launched a large-scale movement to "pick and donate" waste materials. Under the slogan of "everyone looking for materials, every ounce counts," Xuanwu District "picked and donated" a total of eighty-seven tons of scrap iron, more than one thousand kilograms of copper, and more than four thousand seven hundred kilograms of broken rubber, etc. in a few days. The enthusiasm of the staff to "pick and donate" materials was very high, it was really "you donate, I donate, no one is a free rider." Chongwen District has less mechanical industry, and materials are even more scarce. They looked for substitutes, using hardwood instead of copper and iron, and using bamboo panels to make conveyors instead of rubber. Each district manufactured a large number of indigenous and foreign machines in accordance with the spirit of using foreign methods if possible, and indigenous methods if not.

Continuous Revolution and Continuous Progress

The achievements of our first campaign to attack the loading and unloading barrier are generally said to be great, and the experiences are rich. However, there are still some shortcomings in our work, and the existing achievements still need to be continuously consolidated. At present, we are advancing victoriously. According to the spirit of continuous revolution and the current specific situation in the city, our next step is:

First, for units that have achieved loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization, we must vigorously carry out rectification, consolidation, and improvement, further increase the proportion of loading and unloading mechanization, semi-automation, and continuity; and immediately start adjusting the labor organization, resolutely extracting the saved personnel; establish systems for unified use, unified management, and unified maintenance of machinery; further improve loading and unloading machinery, try to achieve "one machine for multiple uses," give full play to the role of loading and unloading machinery, and improve the efficiency of use. For fresh and fragile goods that have not yet achieved loading and unloading mechanization, such as bricks, vegetables, fruits, etc., topics should be proposed, the masses should be mobilized, and further solutions should be found to achieve loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization as soon as possible.

Second, further improve the system and organizational form of large-scale collaboration, strengthen the communist ideological education of cadres and staff, and promote the further development of large-scale collaboration. Pay attention to discovering new things in the budding state in large-scale collaboration, cultivate and promote them, and constantly improve them. At the same time, we must constantly adjust production relations to adapt to the constantly developing needs of the productive forces.

Third, carry forward the experience of the first campaign, launch the second campaign on a larger scale, seize the leadership and inspection, achieve a larger area of harvest, and prepare for the third campaign, strive for a complete victory in the three campaigns, make a great change in the appearance of loading and unloading, eliminate heavy manual labor, and advance to continuity and automation, further develop productive forces, and realize the Municipal Party Committee's call to "double production and halve personnel."

    放手发动群众猛攻装卸关
    中共北京市委交通工作部部长　柴泽民
    任务重　潜力大
    随着国民经济的高速度发展，北京市运输任务日益繁重。1960年全市货运量将比去年增长54％。虽然国家正在大力加强铁路干线上的薄弱环节，修建丰沙（丰台到沙城）线，积极改造北京枢纽站和增添其它一些必要的设备，可是估计车辆增加有限，因此，运量大于运力的矛盾仍然很大。要解决这个矛盾，只有大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，继续大挖运输潜力。
    据我们分析，目前运输工作中的潜力主要有以下几个方面：
    一、落后的装卸方式和现代化运输工具不相适应。工人说这是“跑在中间，窝在两头”。装卸作业主要依靠笨重体力劳动，装卸时间长，效率低，浪费掉很大一部分运力。全市汽车如能把装卸时间压缩一半，就等于增加汽车五百辆左右；火车的装卸作业停留时间如能普遍压缩一半，就等于增加几百辆车皮。
    二、厂矿企业、仓库、工地内部生产过程中的盘运占用着大批专业运输车辆。据三百八十个厂矿统计，就占用汽车四百四十四辆，马车一千八百五十八辆，三轮车七百七十三辆。如果各厂矿企业改善现在落后的运输状况，把这些车辆抽出投入社会运输，每天就能完成运量约五万多吨。
    三、推广以东郊火车站为中心的铁路、公路、企业一条龙大协作的经验，是大挖运输潜力的一项有效措施。去年，东郊地区各单位在朝阳区委领导下，把铁路专用线变为共用，并采取统一使用装卸力量，送货上门等一系列措施，铁路的装车量比1958年提高24.9％，卸车量提高74.6％，公路货运量增长90％。其他各区推广了这一经验，收效也很显著。
    大搞装卸机械化
    根据以上情况，市委指示，必须集中火力猛攻装卸关，进一步发动厂矿办运输和推广一条龙大协作的经验。因此，我们及时部署了开展以装卸机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新、技术革命的群众运动，要在“五一”前组织三次战役，以达到装卸作业机械化、半机械化和部分连续化自动化，加快车辆周转，大大提高运输效率，缓和运输的紧张形势。第一战役要求在广安门、东郊、西直门、永定门、丰台等五个重要货运站为主的环城各站基本实现装卸搬运机械化半机械化；第二战役要求全市厂矿、仓库、工地和所有专用线基本上实现装卸、搬运机械化和半机械化，将厂矿内部盘运占用的专业汽车、马车、三轮车全部抽出，以增加社会运输能力；第三战役要求在全市范围内，全部实现装卸搬运机械化半机械化，进一步提高机械化程度，大搞流水线。通过上述三次战役，进一步加速车辆周转，做到装卸效率翻一番，装卸人员减一半，消灭笨重体力劳动。
    从运输战线到工厂企业，从领导干部到广大职工群众，经过二十天的紧张战斗，胜利地超额实现了第一战役计划，取得了辉煌战果。广安门、东郊、西直门、丰台、永定门、西便门及门头沟等车站，机械化程度由原来的12.6％猛增到70％以上，东郊车站的机械化程度高达85％。上述各车站的装卸效率比原来提高一倍，可以减少一千五百多人，占原有人数的36％；操作技术进一步熟练后，还可以大大减少。永定门站老工人傅宗五歌颂装卸机械化，写了这样一首诗：“肩压几十年，腰痛腿又酸，党来领导咱，大搞机械化，抛掉棍和铣，幸福万万年。”
    东郊机制煤球厂、昌平砂石场、八宝山砂石场和永定门粮库等处已组成四条一条龙半自动运输流水线。这些流水线使物资从产地装车到加工单位和用户卸车，全部过程实行机械化和半自动化，大大加速了车辆的周转。
    从这次战役的特点来看，总的说是：两高、两大，即高风格、高速度，大兵团作战、大面积丰收。
    四点基本经验
    我们攻打装卸关的第一战役取得的辉煌战果，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是共产主义风格的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利。我们所以能在短短的二十天中，取得大面积丰收，主要有以下几点经验。
    一、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。各级党委在持续跃进中，进一步加强了对运输工作的领导。市委在工业交通工作会议以及市群英会上的报告中，对交通运输工作都作了具体明确的指示，提出要大搞装卸机械化半机械化，消灭笨重体力劳动，做到“产量翻一番，人员减一半”。我们根据这一总的要求，提出了“五一”前组织三次战役的规划，使运动有领导、有目标、分阶段的开展。同时，要求各级党委要做到“五抓”：抓思想、抓规划、抓组织、抓措施、抓检查，强调了穷干苦干、自力更生，大搞共产主义协作，号召人人献计献策，大搞群众运动，高速度地实现大面积丰收。各区区委坚决贯彻市委指示，书记挂帅，专人负责，集中力量，狠抓装卸这一关键。今年1月末，为了吸取先进地区经验，市委组织了本市各区和运输部门的党、政负责同志前往天津参观，回来后迅速掀起了“学天津、赶天津”的热潮。一个以实现装卸、搬运机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，便以前所未有的规模展开了。
    二、打破单位界限，开展共产主义大协作。这次高速度攻下装卸关，是大兴协作之风的结果。参加这次革新斗争的，从职业情况看，有工人、有机关干部、有解放军官兵，还有教师、学生、街道居民、人民公社社员；从地区看，有本区的，也有不是本区的，还有远自几百里以外的唐山赶来支援的。这种积极主动前来支援的动人情景，是高尚的共产主义风格的具体表现。在区委召集的一次研究机械加工、制造问题的会议上，区委书记刚刚把需要加工、制造的机械件数提出来，各个工厂企业的负责人就纷纷争着包任务、要“困难”。设备简陋，只有几十个工人的聚丰水暖厂，也当仁不让，“包”来了十一件铸件活。领导上认为他们力量单薄，完成自己的任务就很吃力，担心他们有困难，可是他们说：“放心吧，我们坚决完成！”结果，两方面的任务都完成了。在突击制造装卸机械中，不少工厂在内部采取工人、干部、技术人员三结合，对外采取生产单位、使用单位、设计单位三结合的办法，解决了不少关键问题。制造装卸机械需要的材料，也在共产主义大协作中得到解决。例如，邮电部器材供应处的同志在丰台站提货时，见到该站正大搞装卸机械化，缺少一些材料，他们立即派汽车送来八十套轴承，还支援了三百公斤矽钢片。为着共产主义事业的崇高理想，大家主动协作，蔚为壮观。
    三、放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。在各区区委统一领导下，集中了人力、物力，实行大兵团作战。据不完全的统计，参加运动的人数有五万多人。参加协同作战的共有四百二十多个单位，范围之广、规模之大，空前未有。如果不是大搞群众运动，高速度实现装卸机械化是不可想像的。
    经验证明，大搞群众运动必须与集中领导相结合；只有加强了领导，才能使群众运动健康地向前发展。在这次大搞群众运动的过程中，各级领导都贯彻了紧抓、狠抓，加强了细致的组织工作。按单位进行了“四定”：定项目、定指标、定专人、定交活日期。参加运动的单位每半天向区委汇报一次进展情况，区委每两天召开一次大协作联席会，并且每天深入基层检查指导工作，并进一步发展到一日三抓。这样就可以做到及时解决问题。宣武区参加制造机具的工厂共有二十个，他们以四个主要厂为主组成了联合作战单位，统一计划，统一行动，密切配合，分工协作，完全像前线作战一样充分体现了高度的组织性、纪律性，一环扣一环，做到有条不紊。经验还证明，统一指挥十分重要。为此必须有周密的部署，详细的计划，要精确地计算时间，使厂与厂之间组成一条流水作业线，上下工序互相衔接。宣武机械修理厂生产的二十九台输送机，就有十个工厂为他们加工零件。他们之间，安排计划，检查生产，都是以小时计算的，切实掌握部件、零件的完成时间，分秒必争。为了抢时间，区委决定派一批三轮车赶着运输，一个部件或一批零件做出来以后，装上三轮车就奔向负责下一工序的厂子，飞车来往，穿插交错，像电影院之间赶送“拷贝”一样。
    由于大搞群众运动和集中领导相结合，这次运动做到既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，既声势浩大，又有条不紊。
    四、穷干苦干，自力更生，贯彻执行土洋并举“两条腿走路”的方针。要实现机械化，就要制造大量土洋装卸机械，首先遇到的就是材料问题。各区坚决打破了依赖思想，发动群众穷干苦干、自力更生解决材料问题，一方面根据因料制宜、因陋就简的精神，尽量节省用料，同时发动了一个声势浩大的“拣献”废旧材料的运动。宣武区在“人人找料、斤两都要”的口号下，几天的时间共“拣献”废铁八十七吨，铜一千多斤，破胶皮四千七百多斤等。职工们“拣献”材料的热情十分高涨，真是“你也献，我也献，谁也不当空手汉”。崇文区机械工业少，材料显得更加缺乏，他们就找代用品，没有铜铁就用硬木代替，没有橡胶就用竹板作出输送机。各区按照能洋就洋，不能洋就土的精神制造了大批土洋机械。
    不断革命继续前进
    我们猛攻装卸关的第一战役成绩一般说是巨大的，经验是丰富的。但是，工作中也还有一些缺点，对于既得成绩也还需要不断巩固。目前，我们正在乘胜前进。根据不断革命的精神和本市当前的具体情况，我们下一步的工作是：
    一、对已经实现装卸机械化半机械化的单位，要大力进行整顿、巩固、提高，进一步提高装卸机械化、半自动化、连续化的比重；并立即着手调整劳动组织，把节省出来的人员坚决抽出来；建立机械的统一使用、统一管理、统一养护等制度；进一步改进装卸机具，尽量做到“一机多用”，充分发挥装卸机械的作用，提高使用效率。对尚未实现装卸机械化的鲜嫩易碎货物，如砖、蔬菜、水果等应提出课题，发动群众，进一步加以解决，尽快实现装卸机械化和半机械化。
    二、进一步健全大协作的制度和组织形式，加强干部和职工的共产主义思想教育，推动大协作的进一步发展。注意发现大协作中处于萌芽状态的新生事物，加以培植、提倡，使之不断完善。同时，要不断调整生产关系，以适应生产力不断发展的需要。
    三、发扬第一战役的经验，更大规模地开展第二战役，抓紧领导和检查，实现更大面积的丰收，并为第三战役作好准备，争取三个战役大获全胜，使装卸面貌大改观，消灭笨重体力劳动，并向连续化、自动化进军，进一步发展生产力，实现市委的“生产翻一番，人员减一半”的号召。
