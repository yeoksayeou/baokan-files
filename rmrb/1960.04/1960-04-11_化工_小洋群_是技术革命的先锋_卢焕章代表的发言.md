Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule" report, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

As a worker on the chemical industry front, I would like to briefly report to the congress on the situation and achievements of the chemical industry department in vigorously developing small-scale, foreign (and indigenous) groups over the past two years.

		Vigorously Developing Chemical Industry "Little Foreign Groups" According to Needs and Raw Material Conditions

The great leap forward in the chemical industry that began two years ago has a most vivid and prominent feature. This is that in the development of the chemical industry, we resolutely implemented the series of "walking on two legs" policies put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, such as simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous production methods. In 1959, the total output value of the national chemical industry increased by 49% compared with 1958. Among them, the more than 20,000 chemical industry small foreign (and indigenous) groups across the country played an important role.

The characteristics of the chemical industry are: a wide variety of products, serving a wide range of sectors of the national economy. Before 1958, chemical production was mainly concentrated in large-scale enterprises in a few chemical industry bases, while the foundation of local chemical industry was very poor, and many places did not even have a chemical industry at all. In order to meet the ever-increasing needs of all aspects of the Great Leap Forward for chemical products, the Ministry of Chemical Industry resolutely implemented the Party's "walking on two legs" policy, and decided to vigorously develop chemical industry small foreign groups and small indigenous groups across the country; according to the needs and raw material distribution conditions, planned the layout, established model factories, continuously summarized experience, disseminated technology, and launched projects in batches according to the maturity of production technology. Now, it can be said that the chemical industry has spread all over the country and has yielded fruitful results.

The practice of the past two years has fully proved that resolutely implementing the Party's "walking on two legs" policy and vigorously developing chemical industry small foreign (and indigenous) groups is an important factor in the high-speed development of the chemical industry. This is because small foreign (and indigenous) chemical enterprises have many advantages, mainly:

		The Four Major Advantages of
		Developing Chemical "Little Foreign Groups"

	First, the construction time is short. The construction of large-scale enterprises such as synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants, synthetic rubber plants, acid and alkali plants, etc., generally takes a year or more, while the construction time of small foreign (and indigenous) factories can be greatly shortened, achieving immediate results. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, in 1959 alone, the province built dozens of small chemical plants of different varieties and different scales, with a total output value increasing by about 50% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, reaching 180 million yuan.

	Second, developing chemical industry small foreign (and indigenous) groups not only requires less investment, but also the required equipment is easy to solve. Local machinery industries can manufacture it; the material requirements are relatively simple, and more non-metallic materials such as glass, ceramics, wood, plastics, etc. can be used, thus making it easier to obtain materials locally, produce locally, and use locally.

	Third, small foreign (and indigenous) groups have lower requirements for raw materials. In production, it is easy to adjust according to the needs of raw materials and products, and the production scale can be large or small, and the product varieties can be divided or combined. This creates extremely favorable conditions for the local utilization of decentralized resources and meeting local needs. At the same time, because small foreign (and indigenous) groups have the flexibility of local production and local use, they can reduce long-distance transportation and simplify or save packaging containers.

	Fourth, the production technology of small foreign (and indigenous) group enterprises is easy to master. Soldiers can be trained through practical operation, and the technical strength problem is relatively easy to solve. Before 1958, there were very few people in many places who understood chemical production, but in the past two years, due to the vigorous development of small foreign (and indigenous) groups, through on-site meetings, visits and internships, on-the-job training, practical operation and other methods, the small-scale acid and alkali industry alone has trained about 45,000 people who can operate independently, and the production technology of small-scale acid plants and alkali plants has been widely mastered by various places. If we only rely on schools to train, the growth of chemical technology strength will never be so fast.

Some people once thought that chemical products are numerous and technically complex, and it is not suitable to mobilize the masses to run them. They also expressed doubts about whether small foreign (and indigenous) groups could pass the technical barrier and the economic barrier. However, the practice of the past two years has fully proved that this doubt is unnecessary.

		As long as we break the mystical view, both the
		economic and technical barriers can be overcome

Facts have proved that as long as we break the mystical view of running chemical industry, are good at using the advantages of small foreign (and indigenous) methods, strengthen planning, site selection, experimentation, design, equipment, and capital construction work, and grasp the training of operators, small foreign (and indigenous) groups can not only completely pass the technical barrier, but also completely pass the economic barrier. Taking small-scale contact method sulfuric acid as an example, after more than half a year of efforts, the production technology has been completely mastered by various places, and the production volume can not only often be maintained at the level of the designed output, but also the actual production capacity in many places has greatly exceeded the designed capacity. Up to now, more than 1,000 such small-scale sulfuric acid plants have been built across the country. It is estimated that in the national sulfuric acid total output value stipulated in this year's plan, the production by small foreign groups will account for about 11%; and in terms of the output of local chemical industry, the proportion of production by small foreign groups will be even higher. For example, last year, the sulfuric acid produced by chemical industry small foreign (and indigenous) groups in Henan Province reached 50% of the total sulfuric acid output value of the province.

Facts have also proved that not only inorganic products such as acids, alkalis, and fertilizers with a longer production history can pass the technical barrier in small foreign (and indigenous) groups, but also organic chemical products with a shorter production history, relatively complex technology, and less production experience can also be produced by small foreign (and indigenous) methods. According to the statistics of eight provinces last year, the organic chemical products produced by small foreign (and indigenous) groups, such as ethylene glycol, furfural, acetone, butanol, sebacic acid and other chemical raw materials, organic silicon, polyethylene, epoxy resin and other new plastics, as well as synthetic rubber, medicine, pesticides, rubber products and other varieties, totaled more than 130 kinds, strongly supporting the great leap forward of industry and agriculture.

Can small foreign (and indigenous) groups pass the economic barrier? The facts of the past two years have also given an affirmative answer. It is true that compared with large-scale enterprises, the production cost of small-scale enterprises may be slightly higher. However, it is obviously one-sided and therefore incorrect to calculate the accounts solely from this point of view. Facts have proved that as long as small foreign (and indigenous) enterprises can maintain normal production regularly, continuously improve business management, tap potential, and improve labor productivity, then the production cost can be greatly reduced. Moreover, due to the characteristics of local material acquisition and local use of small-scale enterprises, long-distance transportation and packaging costs can be reduced. In this way, the production cost of small-scale enterprises is not only not higher than that of large-scale enterprises, but lower. If we take into account the advantages of small foreign (and indigenous) groups, such as less investment, steel saving, quick results, and opening up a broad road for future development, and comprehensively calculate the overall accounts, then it is completely cost-effective economically.

Small foreign (and indigenous) groups can not only completely pass the technical and economic barriers, but also absorb the vast masses to vigorously develop the chemical industry. Practice has proved that it is not necessarily only chemical professional departments that can develop small foreign (and indigenous) enterprises in the chemical industry. As long as the mystical view of chemical industry is broken, non-chemical professional departments can also run them. At the same time, due to the blooming of small-scale chemical enterprises everywhere, the chemical technology team has been greatly strengthened, making chemical technology mastered by the broad masses, so that not only the production of small foreign (and indigenous) groups gradually tends to be normal, but also greatly exerts the production potential, making it possible to increase the output by multiples or even several times. Recently, in some places, such as the small-scale sulfuric acid plant of Wuxi Refinery, the daily output has increased from half a ton at the beginning of operation to a maximum of 6.8 tons, which is equivalent to 5.3 times the original design capacity. This is a very vivid example.

		Small foreign groups have the potential to create brand-new production methods

In addition, due to the continuous labor practice of thousands of masses in small-scale enterprises, not only has the production experience of chemical technology been greatly enriched, but also many inventions and creations have continued to emerge. Because the production technology of small-scale enterprises is relatively simple and the equipment scale is relatively small, it also has the characteristics of being easy to transform and easy to conduct experiments while producing. Constantly accumulating production experience in small-scale enterprises and concentrating the wisdom of the broad masses can greatly improve chemical production technology, refresh production processes, reform equipment, and even further completely overthrow traditional production methods and create brand-new production methods. When small foreign (and indigenous) enterprises are armed with brand-new production methods, their advantages are even more obvious, and their production costs and various economic indicators are not necessarily higher than those of large foreign enterprises using traditional production methods, and it is entirely possible to reach a level that large foreign enterprises cannot reach, thereby promoting the technological revolution of large foreign enterprises. For example, the experience of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid industry in production across the country in the past two years has recently been summarized, proving that sulfuric acid production does not have to go through the complicated procedures of traditional production methods, but can be replaced by the "high-temperature purification method" production process that has been tested by small-scale contact method sulfuric acid production, which not only greatly simplifies the production process (the purification process is reduced from ten to five), increases labor productivity by about 40%, and completely eliminates acidic sewage. This new production method has been adopted in the design of some large factories, thereby completely innovating the production face of the sulfuric acid industry.

In summary, small foreign (and indigenous) groups have fully proved in practice that they have incomparably strong vitality. The achievements made on the chemical industry front in the past two years are the victory of the Party's general line of socialist construction and a series of "walking on two legs" policies, and the victory of vigorously carrying out mass movements in the chemical industry sector. We are fully confident that on the basis of the great victories we have already achieved, we will hold high the red banner of the general line and Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and forge ahead bravely to realize the continuous great leap forward in 1960 and even the entire 1960s!

At present, the magnificent and vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution movement is being carried out throughout the country. The broad masses of workers on the chemical industry front are continuing to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, dare to think and dare to act, and are determined to make "inventions become a trend and creations become a forest." Whether it is a large-scale enterprise or a medium and small-scale enterprise, a new atmosphere of colorful and ever-changing is presented. Small-scale enterprises, because they have the characteristics of being easy to transform and easy to experiment, actually act as pioneers of technological innovation and technological revolution. At the same time, it is a good school for cultivating talents, and its future is infinitely broad.

### 化工“小洋群”是技术革命的先锋  卢焕章代表的发言

专栏：

    化工“小洋群”是技术革命的先锋
    卢焕章代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    作为化学工业战线上的一个工作人员，我想在这里将两年来化学工业部门大办小洋（土）群的情况及所取得的成果向大会作一简单的汇报。	  根据需要和原料情况大办化工“小洋群”
    两年以前开始的化学工业大跃进，具有一个最生动、最突出的特点，这就是在化学工业的发展中，坚决贯彻执行了党中央和毛主席提出的中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中、小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。在1959年，全国化工生产总值比1958年增长了49％。其中，为数达两万多个的全国化工小洋（土）群，起了重要的作用。
    化学工业的特点是：品种繁多，为国民经济各部门服务的面相当广泛。在1958年以前，化工生产主要集中在少数几个化工基地的大型企业中，而地方化学工业的基础则是很差的，很多地方甚至根本没有化学工业。为了满足大跃进中各方面对化工产品日益增长的需要，化学工业部坚决贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，决定在兴办大型化工企业的同时，在全国各地大办化工小洋群、小土群；根据需要情况和原料分布等条件，计划布点、举办样板厂、不断总结经验、传播技术，按照生产技术的成熟程度分批上马。现在，可以说化学工业已遍布全国各地，并且已结出了丰硕的果实。
    两年来的实践完全证明，坚决贯彻执行党的“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞化工小洋（土）群，是高速度发展化学工业的一个重要因素。这是因为，小洋（土）的化工企业，具有许多优越性，主要是：
  兴办化工“小洋群”的
          四大优越性
    一、建设时间短。大型企业如合成氨氮肥厂、合成橡胶厂、酸、碱厂等的建设，一般需要一年或一年以上的时间，而建设小洋（土）工厂的时间则可以大大缩短，收到立竿见影的效果。以贵州省为例，在1959年一年中，该省就建设起不同品种、不同规模的小型化工厂几十个，生产总值比大跃进的1958年增长50％左右，达到一亿八千万元。
    二、建设化工小洋（土）群，不但投资少，而且所需设备容易解决。地方机械工业都能制造；材料要求比较简单，可以更多地采用非金属材料如玻璃、陶瓷、木材、塑料等，因而更便于就地取材，就地生产，就地使用。
    三、小洋（土）群对原料的要求比较低。在生产中便于根据原料和产品的需要情况进行调整，生产规模可大可小，生产品种可分可合。这样，就为就地利用分散的资源、满足当地需要创造了极有利的条件。同时，由于小洋（土）群具有就地生产、就地使用的灵活性，可以减少长途运输、简化或节省包装容器。
      四、小洋（土）群企业的生产技术易于掌握。可以通过实际操作来练兵，技术力量问题比较容易解决。1958年以前，许多地方原来懂化工生产的人很少，但是两年来，由于大搞小洋（土）群的结果，通过现场会议、参观实习、跟班培训、实际操作等方式，全国仅小型酸碱行业就已经培养约四万五千名能够独立操作的人员，小型酸厂和碱厂的生产技术，已普遍为各地所掌握。如果只依靠学校来培养，化工技术力量的增长决不会这样快的。
    有些人曾经以为化工产品繁多，技术复杂，不宜于发动群众兴办。他们对小洋（土）群能否过技术关和经济关，也曾表示怀疑。但是，两年来的实践完全证明了，这种怀疑是没有必要的。只要打破神秘观点，经济关
      技术关都可以过
    事实证明，只要打破办化工的神秘观点，善于利用小洋（土）的优越性，加强计划、定点、试验、设计、设备、基建工作，抓紧操作人员的培养，小洋（土）群不仅完全可以过技术关，而且完全可以过经济关。以小型接触法硫酸为例，经过半年多的努力，生产技术已经完全为各地所掌握，生产量不仅可以经常保持在设计产量的水平上，而且有很多地方的实际生产能力已经大大超过了设计能力。到目前为止，全国各地已建成这样的小型硫酸厂一千多个。预计在今年计划规定的全国硫酸总产值中，由小洋群生产的将占11％左右；而在地方化学工业产量方面，小洋群生产所占的比重将更高，如去年河南省化工小洋（土）群生产的硫酸，已达到全省硫酸总产值的50％。
    事实还证明，不但生产历史较久的酸、碱、化肥等无机产品可以在小洋（土）群中过技术关，就是生产历史较短、技术比较复杂、生产经验还比较缺乏的有机化工产品，也同样可以采取小洋（土）群的办法来生产。去年一年中，根据八个省的统计，由小洋（土）群生产的有机化工产品如乙二醇、糠醛、丙酮、丁醇、癸二酸等化工原料，有机硅、聚乙烯、环氧树脂等新型塑料，以及合成橡胶、医药、农药、橡胶制品等品种总共达一百三十多种，有力地支援了工农业的大跃进。
    小洋（土）群能不能过经济关呢？两年来的事实，同样作了肯定的回答。不错，与大型企业相比，小型企业的生产成本可能要稍高一些。但是，单从这一点着眼来算账，显然是片面的，因而是不正确的。事实证明，只要小洋（土）企业能够经常正常生产，不断改善经营管理，挖掘潜力，提高劳动生产率，那么生产成本是能够大大降低的。而且，由于小型企业具有就地取材、就地使用的特点，因此就可以减少长途运输和包装等费用。这样，小型企业的生产成本，与大型企业相比，不仅不高，反而低了。如果把小洋（土）群投资少，钢材省，收效快，为今后的大发展开辟了宽广的道路等等好处考虑在内，全面地算一下大账，那么它在经济上就是完全合算的。
    小洋（土）群不仅完全可以过技术关和经济关，而且，可以吸收广大的群众来大办化学工业。实践证明，举办化学工业的小洋（土）企业，并不一定只有化工专业部门才能搞成。只要打破对化工的神秘观点，非化工专业部门也同样可以兴办。同时，由于小型化工企业遍地开花的结果，大大壮大了化工技术队伍，使化工技术为广大群众所掌握，从而不仅使小洋（土）群的生产逐渐趋于正常，而且大大发挥了生产潜力，有可能使产量成倍以至几倍地增长。最近，有些地方如无锡炼油厂的小型硫酸厂，日产量已由开工时的半吨，提高到最高可达六点八吨，相当于原设计能力的五点三倍。这便是一个很生动的例子。	  小洋群有可能创造崭新的生产方法
    此外，由于成千成万的群众在小型企业中的不断劳动实践，不但大大丰富了化工技术的生产经验，而且不断涌现出许多发明创造。由于小型企业的生产技术比较简单，设备规模比较小，因而也就具有便于改造和便于边生产边试验的特点。在小型企业中不断积累生产经验，集中广大群众智慧的结果，就有可能大大提高化工生产技术，刷新生产工艺，改革设备，以至更进一步全部推翻传统的生产方法，创造崭新的生产方法。当小洋（土）企业用全新的生产方法武装起来的时候，它的优越性就更加显示了出来，它的生产成本和各种经济指标就不见得比用传统生产方法的大洋企业高，而完全有可能达到大洋企业所不能达到的程度，从而推动大洋企业的技术革命。例如，最近总结了小型接触法硫酸工业两年来在全国各地生产的经验，证明了硫酸生产可以不必经过传统生产方法的繁杂工序，可代之以经过小型接触法硫酸生产考验了的“高温净化法”生产流程，不仅大大简化了生产流程（净化工序由十道减至五道），提高劳动生产率约40％，完全消灭了酸性污毒下水。这个新的生产方法已经采用于某些大厂的设计中，从而完全革新了硫酸工业的生产面貌。
    综上所述，小洋（土）群在实践中完全证明它具有无比强大的生命力。两年来，在化工战线上所取得的成绩，是党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的胜利，是在化学工业部门中大搞群众运动的胜利。我们完全有信心在已经取得的伟大胜利的基础上，更高地举起总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，为实现1960年乃至整个六十年代的连续大跃进奋勇前进！
    目前，波澜壮阔、声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国范围内开展着。化工战线上的广大职工，正在继续破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，决心要使“发明成风、创造成林”。不论大型企业，或是中、小型企业，都呈现出一片万紫千红、时新日异的新气象，而小型企业，由于它具有便于改造、便于试验的特点，因而实际上充当着技术革新和技术革命的先行。同时，它又是培养人材的好学校，其前途是无限广阔的。
