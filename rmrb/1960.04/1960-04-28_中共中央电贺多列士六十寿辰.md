For thirty years, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by you, the French Communist Party has consistently fought for the unity of the French working class and all democratic and progressive forces, for the struggle to win and defend the vital interests and democratic rights of the working people, for resisting Fascist aggression and safeguarding the independence of France, for opposing the oppression of colonial peoples and supporting their independence movements, and for striving to realize socialism, and has achieved brilliant successes; at the same time, it has made outstanding contributions to the international workers' movement and the cause of human progress. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people express their infinite respect for the French Communist Party, which firmly grasps the banner of Marxism-Leninism and fights heroically. We wish you even greater success in the future in leading the French Communist Party and the French people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.
