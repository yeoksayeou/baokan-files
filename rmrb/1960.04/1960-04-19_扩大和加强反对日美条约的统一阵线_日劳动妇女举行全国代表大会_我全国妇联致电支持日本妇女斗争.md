Xinhua News Agency, April 18th, Tokyo: More than two thousand representatives of Japanese working women held a national congress in Tokyo yesterday and today. The congress passed a declaration stating that they will actively expand and strengthen the united front of working women and housewives in order to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty" and strive for complete disarmament. This congress is the largest women's congress held annually since 1957. This year's congress was convened to mark the end of Women's Month, celebrating the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day.

The meeting passed resolutions on strengthening the movement to demand the United States return Okinawa to Japan, on suggesting women take action to support the struggle of the Miike coal miners, and on demanding equal pay for equal work for men and women.

The congress selected fifty representatives to submit a petition to the Diet opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Yesterday, the congress divided into thirteen groups to discuss issues related to the women's movement. At the group meeting discussing peace issues, representatives unanimously agreed that only through a heroic struggle against fascist aggression can Japan's peace, independence, and democracy be defended.

Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to the National Women's Congress to Prevent Ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which will be held in Tokyo on the 16th, stating that Chinese women and the Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese women's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. The telegram stated: "With the support of the powerful socialist camp and peace-loving people and women all over the world, we firmly believe that your struggle will achieve final victory."

In the telegram, the All-China Women's Federation expressed warm congratulations and high respect to the Japanese women for holding the National Congress to Prevent Ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Tokyo. The telegram stated: "The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government is colluding with U.S. imperialism to sign the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' revive Japanese militarism, and attempt to push Japan once again into the abyss of war, driving the Japanese people, women, and children to serve as atomic cannon fodder. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke openly colluded with Adenauer, frantically resuming the activities of the German-Japanese axis of aggression, which is another concrete step by the United States to create tension and prepare for a new war of aggression. This is a dangerous signal for the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world.

"Japanese women, together with the Japanese people, have risen up to oppose the Japan-U.S. reactionaries dragging the Japanese nation onto the old road of militarist aggressive war. This fully demonstrates the firm will of Japanese women and mothers to oppose U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government. The holding of this National Women's Congress to Prevent Ratification of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' will further inspire the fighting spirit of Japanese women. We extend our highest respect to you."

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Tokyo: More than 400 representatives from all walks of life in Tokyo held a conference on the 16th, demanding that the government immediately conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

The conference was jointly convened by the Japan-Soviet Association, the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Peace Committee, the Greater Japan Fisheries Association, and others.

The resolution passed by the conference demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government take concrete measures to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union and also condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for signing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" targeting the Soviet Union.

Yasui Iku, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, made the main speech to the conference. He emphasized that the newly signed Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a huge obstacle on the road to establishing peaceful relations with the Soviet Union and ensuring peace and Japanese security.

Yasui Iku also pointed out that if the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union is to develop, it is necessary to hold meetings to take a clear-cut stance on the so-called "territorial issue" and the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Yamamoto Kumaichi, president of the Association for the Promotion of International Trade, and Fukushima Yoichi, a member of the Science Council of Japan, also spoke at the meeting. Representatives of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party also spoke at the conference, encouraging the struggle to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

    扩大和加强反对日美条约的统一阵线
    日劳动妇女举行全国代表大会
    我全国妇联致电支持日本妇女斗争
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：两千多名日本劳动妇女的代表昨天和今天在东京举行全国大会。大会通过宣言，表示她们要积极扩大和加强劳动妇女和家庭妇女的统一阵线，以便阻止国会批准新“安全条约”，并为实现全面裁军而奋斗。这次大会是自从1957年以来每年举行的妇女大会中规模最大的一次。今年的大会是为了庆祝国际妇女节五十周年的妇女月结束而召开的。
      会议通过了关于加强要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本的运动的决议、关于建议妇女采取行动支持三池煤矿工人斗争的决议、关于要求男女工人同工同酬的决议等。
    大会选派了五十位代表，向国会提交了请愿书，反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”。
    大会在昨天曾经分成十三个小组，讨论了同妇女运动有关的问题。在讨论和平问题的小组会上，代表们一致认为，只有对法西斯进攻作英勇的斗争，才能保卫日本的和平、独立和民主。
    新华社15日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报给16
  日将在东京举行的日本阻止批准日美“安全条约”全国妇女大会说，中国妇女和中国人民坚决支持日本妇女反对日美军事同盟的斗争。电报说：“在强大的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民和妇女的支持下，我们坚信你们的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。”
    全国妇联在电报中对日本妇女在东京举行阻止批准日美“安全条约”全国大会表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。电报说：“岸信介反动政府勾结美帝国主义，签订日美‘安全条约’，复活日本军国主义，企图把日本再度推向战争灾难的深渊，驱使日本人民、妇女、儿童充当原子炮灰。最近岸信介公开和阿登纳勾结，猖狂地恢复德日侵略轴心的活动，是美国制造紧张局势，准备新侵略战争的又一个具体步骤。这对日本人民、亚洲人民以及世界人民都是一个危险的信号。
    “日本妇女和日本人民一道，奋起反对日美反动派把日本民族拖上军国主义侵略战争的老路，这充分表现了日本妇女母亲们反对美帝国主义和岸信介反动政府的坚强意志。这次阻止批准日美‘安全条约’全国妇女大会的举行，将更加鼓舞日本妇女的斗志，我们谨向你们致以崇高的敬意。”
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：东京各界代表四百多人16日举行大会，要求政府立即同苏联缔结和约。
    这次大会是由日苏协会、日本社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会、日本和平委员会、大日本水产会等联合召开的。
    大会通过的决议要求岸信介政府采取具体措施同苏联缔结和约，并且指责岸信介政府签订针对苏联的新日美“安全条约”。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁向大会作了主要发言。他强调指出，新签订的日美“安全条约”是在同苏联建立和平关系以及保证和平和日本安全的道路上的巨大障碍。
    安井郁还指出，如果要使争取同苏联缔结和约的运动有所发展，必需举行会议对所谓的“领土问题”和新日美“安全条约”采取鲜明的立场。
    在会上发言的还有国际贸易促进会会长山本熊一和日本学术会议成员福岛要一。社会党和共产党的代表也在大会上讲话，鼓励争取同苏联缔结和约的斗争。
