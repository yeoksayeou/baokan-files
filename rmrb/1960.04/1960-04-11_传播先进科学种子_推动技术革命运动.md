Introducing the Working Experience of the Jilin Science Association
Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

    We fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960,” Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft,” and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin’s “Striving for the Early Realization of the National Agricultural Development Program,” and we will study them carefully and implement their spirit into our work.

    Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our motherland, the work of the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Association has also developed greatly.
	Rapid Development and Continuous Expansion of Grassroots Science Association Organizations
    In terms of organization: By the end of 1959, all six special zones (cities) and forty-two cities and counties in the province had established science association organizations. The development of grassroots science associations has also been rapid: science associations have been established in rural people's communes, accounting for 86.2% of the total number of people's communes in the province; science associations in factories and mines account for 26% of the total number of factories and mines; science associations in schools, hospitals, and research units account for 41.4% of the total number of these units. The province currently has 217,306 members, including 116,395 worker-peasant members, accounting for 53.6% of the total membership. Science association branches and member groups have been established in the management areas and production teams of various communes, and in the workshops and work sections of factories and mines. Science association organizations have spread throughout the cities and rural areas of the province. According to needs, the province has established twelve specialized academic societies, and cities and counties have established a total of 189 academic societies, covering eighteen professions. With the current upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the number of members and science association organizations is still expanding.
	Organizing Various Activities Around Central Production Tasks
    These science association organizations and academic societies, focusing on the central production tasks and mass movements of each period, seize opportunities, meet needs, identify key points, and organize various professional activities at any time and anywhere, vigorously engaging in scientific research, vigorously summarizing experiences and appraising results, promoting advanced experiences, and organizing training courses. This has made the province's science and technology work vigorous and flourishing from the province, cities, and counties to the management areas and production teams of people's communes, and to the workshops and work sections of factories and mines. For example, on the basis of the Provincial Science and Technology Gift-Giving Conference held on New Year's Day in 1959, cities and counties organized gift-giving activities for May Day, July 1st, and the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country under the general slogan of "Presenting Gifts to the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Country." According to incomplete statistics from thirty-seven cities and counties alone, the National Day gift projects reached 5,401 items. After the large-scale iron and steel smelting in 1958, when Jilin Province first established an iron and steel base, the Provincial Metallurgical Society organized an "Iron and Steel Technology Investigation Team" to go deep into the front lines to summarize the technical experience of iron and steel smelting, and later held a provincial experience exchange conference. They supported iron and steel production in improving the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and extending the life of converters. Jilin Province had an unprecedentedly abundant harvest last year, and the province widely and deeply carried out mass-based activities to summarize the experience of agricultural high yields. According to statistics, forty-eight cities and counties organized a total of 682 investigation teams, summarizing the high-yield experience of various crops and many special experiences. The high-yield experience investigation team organized by the Provincial Agronomy Society divided into six areas, spent more than three months, seriously investigating, summarizing the high-yield experience of implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" under different regions, different crops, and different conditions, and held several experience exchange conferences. This province-wide summary and promotion of experience will be a powerful factor in ensuring continued good harvests this year. Last spring, after the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on improving agricultural tools, the Provincial Science Association cooperated with relevant departments to mobilize members and the masses to launch a technical innovation movement to vigorously reform agricultural tools. The Provincial, Municipal, and County Science Associations conducted a large amount of work in the design, trial production, appraisal, summary, promotion of tool reforms, and training of new agricultural tool operators. Dehui County alone mobilized 3,594 science association members and nearly 100,000 people to participate in the tool reform movement.

    In conjunction with this movement and the central production tasks, the Dafangshen People's Commune Science Association in the county successfully researched and developed a variety of new agricultural tools and native fertilizers, established 59 experimental professional teams for soybeans, sorghum, millet, wheat, etc.; held twelve short-term training courses, training 3,100 various technical personnel; held twelve on-site meetings, promoting 37 new technologies; and popularized scientific and technological knowledge 8,890 times. The Science Association Branch of Xiaoli River Management Area of Yantongshan, Panshi County, created native fertilizer, which increased the yield of soybeans per hectare from 2,900 jin to 4,750 jin. The Medical Association organized a large number of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to go deep into the front lines to carry out academic activities centered on the prevention and treatment of Keshan disease, hepatitis, and seasonal epidemics, and summarized prevention and treatment experiences. Taking the prevention and treatment of Keshan disease alone, due to the concerted efforts of leaders, experts, and the masses, the morbidity and mortality rate dropped from 75% to 13.3%, and one district even dropped to 3.3%. In addition, the Civil Engineering Society, the Coal Society, the Chemical and Chemical Engineering Society, the Geology and Geography Society, the Mathematics and Physics Society, and the Radio and Electronics Society have also carried out many professional activities around the province's production key points and major scientific and technological issues, which have played a significant role in promoting production, teaching, and scientific research.
	Science Association Organizations Play a Huge Role in the Technical Revolution Movement
    In terms of technical innovation and technical revolution, under the leadership of the Party, science associations at all levels mobilized the broad masses to break through key links, set off magnificent waves, and widely disseminate the results. For example, the Science Association of the Second United Wood Factory of Changchun Construction Enterprise actively implemented the instructions of the Party Committee, mobilized the masses, and realized the mechanization of the entire factory's production. The Science Association of the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, under the leadership of the Party Committee, cooperated with the Trade Union and the Communist Youth League, and realized a total of 1,750 technical innovations and technical researches in one year, and obtained 68 major research results; summarized more than 180 advanced production experiences, and compiled and printed six volumes of technical materials. After the province vigorously launched the technical innovation and technical revolution movement at the beginning of this year, the province's science association organizations enthusiastically organized members and the masses to participate in this great mass movement. Taking the Changchun Municipal Science Association as an example, within one month, it had already mobilized various academic societies to timely organize members to conduct detailed technical appraisals of more than a thousand innovation and creation achievements and technical materials emerging in the movement, put forward improvement opinions, and selected projects with greater significance and universality among them, compiled them into "Production Technology Information," and promoted them in a timely manner; classified the technical materials, selected them, and compiled them into manuals such as "Automatic Production Line" and "Mechanization of Handicraft Operations."

    In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, grassroots science association organizations have played the role of the Party's tool and assistant, and the broad masses of members have stood at the forefront of the movement. For example, the Science Association of Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, in cooperation with the Trade Union and the Communist Youth League, organized members to establish an "Amateur Factory" to serve the technical revolution in order to break through technical key points. As soon as the factory was established, it used waste materials to produce parts and infrared dryers needed by the workshop, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in the entire factory for technical revolution. Another example is the Second Wood Factory of Changchun Construction Enterprise, whose scientific research team led by Guo Enji, chairman of the factory's Science Association, worked hard for six days and nights to complete four automatic production lines, which increased efficiency by nine times and reduced five processes compared to the original mechanization level.

    The above are just some examples of the work of science association organizations at all levels in Jilin Province. According to incomplete statistics, in 1959, science association organizations throughout the province held 3,338 various academic report meetings; 9,214 experience exchange meetings; 8,334 technical training classes, training 414,751 various technical personnel; held 5,700 exhibitions, with 6,029,328 visitors; screened science and education films and slides 10,458 times, with 4,009,328 visitors; broadcast lectures 59,369 times; gave speeches 1,201,745 times; and published 100,650 issues of blackboards (galleries). In terms of written publicity, the Provincial Science Association published 450,000 copies of "Jilin Science Association"; 130 kinds of publicity materials pamphlets, 350,000 copies; 45,000 copies of "Jilin Health." The "Popular Science" (Korean) in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, more than 96,000 copies. 3,000 copies of "Science and Technology" in Changchun City. Cities and counties have jointly printed and distributed 3,142 kinds of publicity materials, 1,323,401 copies.
	Several Experiences in Carrying Out the Work of the Science Association
    From this, it can be seen that since the Great Leap Forward, the work of the Jilin Provincial Science Association, like the science associations in other provinces, has played a huge role. These achievements are mainly due to the implementation of the National Science Association's general policy of "resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party, boldly mobilizing the masses, closely combining with production, continuously expanding the scientific and technological team, and constantly pushing the mass movement of technical revolution to a new upsurge." When implementing this general policy in specific work, we have the following deep experiences.
     (1) In the establishment and development of science association organizations and academic societies, we have adhered to the principle of "hanging" and "relying on," and from the province, cities, and counties, to the workshops and work sections of factories and mines, and to the management areas and production teams of people's communes, we have closely relied on the leadership of the Party groups of relevant business departments, and we have relied on them closely, firmly, and at all levels, relying on them to the end. This is the only way to enable the work of the Science Association to be directly led by the Party groups of relevant business departments and included in the work agenda of the Party groups. Therefore, it can also enable the activities of the Science Association organizations to be more closely combined with the central tasks of relevant departments, and to focus on what relevant departments need, so that the Science Association can effectively play the role of promoting production and become their effective tool and assistant.

    Because the Science Association organizations have carried out many beneficial activities and promoted production, the Party Committee, the masses, the members, and the Science Association organizations themselves are satisfied, and the Science Association organizations have received attention and welcome from all parties. For example, Secretary Song of Xiaoli River Management Area of Yantongshan Commune said, "I cannot lead production without the Science Association organization," and an old farmer said, "When I see you research and develop new tools, my heart is bright."
     (2) The work of the Science Association is mass-based work, and in terms of organization and activities, the principle of combining leading cadres, scientific and technological workers, and workers and peasants must be implemented. Taking the medical association's organization of the prevention and treatment of Keshan disease as an example, Keshan disease has been considered incurable for decades. Due to the attention of the leadership, outstanding medical workers in the province were organized, and with the cooperation of the local people in the affected areas, such significant prevention and treatment results were obtained.

    Through the grassroots organizations of the Science Association, the role of local experts can be fully发挥, which is an important aspect of mobilizing various positive factors. Because local experts dare to think and act, and are courageous in invention and creation, through their research and innovation activities, on the one hand, they can solve production key points, and at the same time, their activities themselves are a good education for the broad masses to break superstitions and liberate their minds. Fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of local experts can bring along the broad masses, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution activities in their units can be carried out frequently and actively. The use of propaganda and mobilization and competition and other forms can mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for the leap forward in science and technology.
     (3) In scientific and technological activities to solve key production problems, from the province, cities, and counties to the grassroots level, they can be connected as a whole, and various professional academic societies can also cooperate and support each other from left to right. Because the Science Association is a mass-based organization, it can organize the scientific and technological forces of business departments, research institutions, universities, and workers and peasants together according to needs. For example, the recently organized water conservancy investigation team, because it is a comprehensive scientific and technological work, participants include members of the Water Conservancy Society, as well as members of the Medical Society, Forestry Society, Soil Society, Civil Engineering Society, etc., forming a large collaboration.

    Through the Science Association, grassroots units can also organize off-site collaboration in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.
     (4) For intellectuals, the activities of the Science Association are an opportunity for them to go deep into the masses and deep into reality. On the one hand, intellectuals can play their active role in meeting the needs of production, and at the same time, they can open up the path of linking theory with practice in scientific research. Intellectuals and the masses working together and learning from the masses is also a good opportunity for self-transformation.

    In short, the most important key here is to resolutely implement the Party's central tasks and implement the Party's mass line policy in specific work. Only in this way can we make the work of science associations at all levels a part of the Party's central work and become a part of the people.
    In the past year, under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of the National Science Association, the Jilin Provincial Science Association has made some achievements, but its work is still far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation, and the development of work is not very balanced, especially last year, not enough attention was paid to the work of the Science Association of factories and mines, and there are many other shortcomings. However, under the excellent situation of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in our country will inevitably be carried out more widely and more deeply, forming a new upsurge. We firmly believe that with the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, in this torrent that is rapidly changing the face of our country, in order to victoriously realize the 1960 national economic leap forward plan, and to accelerate the development of the socialist cause, the Jilin Provincial Science Association will certainly be able to better play its active role as the Party's tool and assistant in promoting the popularization and improvement of science and technology for all the people.

    传播先进科学种子　推动技术革命运动
    王玉贤　李川江　吴学周　唐敖庆　张德馨代表  王大珩　吴学蔺　张德庆　黄叔培　鲍鉴清委员  介绍吉林科协工作经验主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告，并且要好好学习，把它们的精神实质贯彻到工作中去。
    在祖国社会主义建设大跃进的形势下，吉林省科学技术协会的工作也有很大的发展。	基层科协组织发展迅速并不断扩大
    在组织方面：到1959年底，全省六个专区（市）和四十二个市县全部建立了科协组织。基层科协发展也很迅速：全省已建立了农村人民公社科协，占全省人民公社数的86.2％；厂矿科协，占厂矿总数的26％；学校、医院、研究单位的科协，占这些单位总数的41.4％。全省现有会员二十一万七千三百零六人。其中工农会员十一万六千三百九十五人，占会员总数的53.6％。各公社管理区，生产队，厂矿的车间、工段都建立了科协分会和会员小组。科协组织已遍布全省的城市和农村。根据需要省建立了十二个专门学会，各市、县建立的学会共达一百八十九个，包括了十八个专业。随着当前技术革新、技术革命运动的高涨，会员和科协组织还在不断地扩大。	围绕中心生产任务组织各种活动
    这些科协组织和学会围绕着各期的中心生产任务和群众运动，抓时机、按需要、找关键、随时随地组织各种各样的专业活动，大搞科学研究，大搞经验总结和结果鉴定，推广先进经验，组织训练班。这样使全省的科技工作，从省、市、县一直到人民公社的管理区、生产队，一直到厂矿的车间、工段，波澜壮阔，到处都蓬勃发展。例如，在省召开的1959年元旦科技献礼大会的基础上，各市、县在“向建国十周年献礼”的总口号下，组织了五一、七一和建国十周年的献礼活动。仅据三十七个市、县的不完全统计，国庆献礼项目即达五千四百零一项。在1958年大炼钢铁以后，吉林省才首次建立钢铁基地的时候，省冶金学会就组织了“钢铁技术考察团”，深入现场总结了炼铁炼钢技术经验，并在以后举行了全省经验交流会议。在提高高炉利用系数及延长转炉寿命等方面支援了钢铁生产，吉林省去年农业空前丰收，全省广泛深入地开展了群众性的总结农业丰产经验的活动。据统计四十八个市县共组织了各种考查团六百八十二个，总结了各种作物的丰产经验和许多专题经验，省农学会组织的丰产经验考察团，分六个片区，费了三个多月，认真地调查，总结了不同地区、不同作物、不同条件下执行“农业八字宪法”的丰产经验，并多次召开了经验交流大会。这样全省范围的经验总结与推广将为保证今年继续丰收的有力因素。去年春天在省委、省人委发出了改良农具的指示后，省科协就配合有关部门，发动会员和群众，掀起了一个大搞农具改革的技术革新运动，在工具改革的设计、试制、鉴定、总结推广、新农具操作手的训练等方面，省、市县科协进行了大量的工作。仅德惠县就调动了三千五百九十四名科协会员和近十万名群众参加了工具改革运动。
    结合这个运动以及中心生产任务，该县大房身人民公社科协，研究成功了多种新农具和土化肥，建立了大豆、高粱、谷子、小麦等五十九个试验专业队；举办了十二期短期训练班，培养了三千一百名各种技术手；召开了十二次现场会议，推广了三十七种新技术；还普及科学技术知识八千八百九十次，盘石县烟筒山小力河管理区科协分会创造了土化肥，使大豆每垧单量由二千九百斤提高到四千七百五十斤。医学会组织了大批中西医深入现场，开展了以防治克山病、防治肝炎和季节性流行病为中心的学术活动，总结了防治经验。单就克山病的防治来说，由于领导、专家、群众间的通力协作使发病死亡率从75％下降到13.3％，有一区还下降到3.3％。此外如土建学会、煤炭学会、化学化工学会、地质地理学会、数理学会、无线电电子学会等也都围绕着全省的生产关键和重大科技课题，展开了许多专业活动，对生产、教学、科学研究起了显著的推动作用。	在技术革命运动中科协组织发挥巨大作用
    在技术革新技术革命方面，各级科协，在党的领导下，发动广大群众突破主要环节，掀起壮阔的波澜，并将结果广为传播，如长春市建筑企业第二联合木工厂科协，积极贯彻党委指示，动员群众，实现了全厂生产机械化。省农业机械厂科协，在党委领导下，与工会、共青团协作，一年中共实现了技术革新、技术研究一千七百五十件，获得了六十八项重大研究成果；总结了先进生产经验一百八十余篇，编印了六册技术资料。今年年初全省大力开展了技术革新、技术革命运动以后，全省科协组织轰轰烈烈地组织了会员和群众参加这一伟大的群众运动。仅以长春市科协而论，一月之中就已发动了各个学会及时地组织会员对运动中涌现出来的革新创造成果和技术资料千余项进行了细致的技术鉴定，提出了改进意见，并选择其中较有重大意义和普遍意义的项目，编成“生产技术情报”，及时推广；将技术资料分门别类，加以选择，编成“自动生产线”和“手工业操作机械化”等手册。
    在这技术革新、技术革命运动中，各基层科协组织发挥了党的工具和助手作用，广大会员都站在运动的最前列。例如长春化学制药厂科协，配合工会、共青团组织会员成立了为技术革命服务的“业余工厂”来突破技术关键，该厂一成立就利用废料生产了车间需用的零件和红外干燥器等，从而大大地带动了全厂群众技术革命的热情和信心，又如长春建筑企业第二木工厂，以厂科协主席郭恩吉为首的科技研究小组苦战六昼夜，完成了四条自动生产线，比原来机械化程度提高效率九倍，减少工序五道。
    上面所举只是吉林省科协各级组织一些工作的例子。据不完全统计1959年全省科协组织举行了各种学术报告会三千三百三十八次；经验交流会九千二百一十四次；技术培训八千三百三十四班，培训各种技术人材四十一万四千七百五十一人次；举行展览会五千七百次，观众达六百零二万九千三百二十八人次。放映科教片和幻灯一万零四百五十八次，观众达四百万零九千三百二十八人次；广播讲座五万九千三百六十九次；讲演一百二十万一千七百四十五次；黑板报（画廊）十万零六千五百期。在文字宣传方面，省科协出版了“吉林科协”四十五万份；宣传资料小册子一百三十种，三十五万册；“吉林卫生”四万五千册。延边朝鲜族自治州的“科学大众”（朝文），九万六千余册。长春市的“科学与技术”三千册。各市县共印发宣传资料三千一百四十二种，一百三十二万三千四百零一册。	开展科协工作中的几点体会
    从此可以看出：大跃进以来吉林省科协的工作，如同其他各省的科协一样，发挥了巨大的作用。这些成绩，主要是由于贯彻了全国科协坚决依靠党的领导，放手发动群众，密切结合生产，不断壮大科学技术队伍，把技术革命群众运动不断推向新的高潮”的总方针。在具体工作中贯彻这一总方针时，我们有以下几点深刻的体会。
      （1）在科协组织和学会的建立与发展上，我们坚持了“挂”“靠”的原则，从省、市、县，一直到厂矿车间、工段，一直到人民公社的管理区、生产队，都紧紧依靠有关业务部门党组的领导，而且是靠得紧，靠得牢，层层依靠，一靠到底。这样才能使科协的工作得到有关业务部门党组的直接领导，列入党组的工作日程。因此也就能使科协组织的活动能够更密切地结合有关部门的中心任务，有关部门需要什么，就抓什么，使科协切实起到推动生产的作用而成为他们的有效工具和助手。
    由于科协组织开展了许多有益活动，推动了生产，因而使党委、群众、会员和科协组织本身都感到满意，科协组织得到了各方面的重视和欢迎，例如烟筒山公社小力河管理区宋书记说“我领导生产离不了科协组织”，又如某老农说：“我看到你们研究出新工具，我心就亮堂了”。
      （2）科协工作，是群众性的工作，在组织和活动上，必须贯彻领导干部，科学技术工作者，工农群众三结合的原则。以上述的医学会组织克山病的防治为例，克山病在过去几十年，一直是认为无法医治的，由于领导的重视，组织了省内优秀的医学工作者，并且得到患区当地群众的合作，才得到这样显著的防治效果。
    通过科协的基层组织，可以充分发挥土专家的作用，从而是调动各种积极因素的一个重要方面。因为土专家敢想敢干，勇于发明创造，通过他们的研究和革新活动，一方面可以解决生产关键，同时他们的活动本身就是对广大群众很好的破除迷信，解放思想的教育。充分调动土专家的积极性，就可以把广大群众带动起来，使所在单位的技术革新技术革命的活动，能够经常活跃地开展。利用宣传鼓动以及竞赛等形式可以调动群众对于科学技术跃进的积极性。
      （3）在解决生产关键问题的科技活动中，从省、市、县到基层之间，可以上下连成一片，各个专业学会之间，也可以左右配合，互相支援，并且由于科协是一个群众性的组织，因此可以根据需要，把业务部门，研究机关，高等学校，工农群众的科学技术力量，组织在一起。例如最近组织的水利考察团，由于是一项综合性的科技工作，参加者除了水利学会而外，还有医学会，林学会，土壤学会，土木建筑学会等的成员，形成大协作。
    通过科协也可以使基层单位在技术革新技术革命运动中组织场外协作。
     （4）对于知识分子来说，科协的活动是知识分子深入群众深入实际的机会。知识分子一方面就生产的需要发挥他的积极作用，同时也开辟了科学研究中理论联系实际的途径。知识分子和群众打成一片，向群众学习，也是自我改造的良好机会。
    总之这里最重要的关键是要在具体工作中，坚决执行党的中心任务，贯彻党的群众路线的方针。只有这样，我们才能把各级科协的工作成为党的中心工作的一个组成部分，成为人分。
    一年来，吉林省科协在党的领导下和全国科协的指导下虽然有了些成绩，但工作还远不能满足形势发展的需要，工作发展还不很平衡，尤其是去年对厂矿科协的工作注意不够，其他缺点还很多。但是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗飘扬的大好形势下，我国的技术革新技术革命运动必然会更广泛地更深入的开展起来，形成新的高潮。我们深信，有了党的领导和群众的支持，在这迅速改变着我国面貌的洪流中，为了胜利地实现1960年的国民经济的跃进计划，为了加快社会主义事业的发展，吉林省科协一定能在促进全民性的科学技术的普及与提高这一光荣任务上，更好地发挥它作为党的工具和助手的积极作用。
