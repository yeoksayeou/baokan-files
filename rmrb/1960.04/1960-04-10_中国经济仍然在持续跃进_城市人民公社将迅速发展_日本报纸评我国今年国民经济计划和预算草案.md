Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Tokyo News: Many Japanese newspapers, in reporting on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Budget Draft presented at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China, believe that China will continue to leap forward this year.

    The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" said on April 1st that Li Fuchun's report stated that the growth rate of China's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 23% compared to last year, indicating that this year will still be a continuous leap forward. The newspaper said that it is worth noting that "the entire plan is permeated with a principle: 'further establishing agriculture as the foundation, combining the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture'," and for the first time, the progress of urban people's communes was mentioned.

    "Akahata" pointed out that in Li Xiannian's report, it is worth noting that the final accounts for the past year reflect economic prosperity, exceeding the initial budget, with a surplus of nearly 1.4 billion yuan. The increase in the revenue budget comes almost entirely from the revenue of state-owned enterprises, indicating that the financial foundation has been consolidated. The newspaper believes that the expenditure budget for economic and cultural construction accounts for more than 80% of the entire budget, while defense spending accounts for only 8.3%, indicating that this is a budget for peaceful socialist construction.

    Several major Japanese bourgeois newspapers also acknowledged the speed of China's continued leap forward. The "Asahi Shimbun" said on the 1st that the congress announced China's 1960 National Economic Plan and Budget Draft for continued leap forward this year on the first day, which appeared full of vigor from the start.

    The newspaper said that the reason why agricultural mechanization has progressed so rapidly in China shows that China's industrial capacity has gained the strength commensurate with a modern country's status after ten years of construction. It said that this can also be seen from the fact that the production of steel ingots this year will increase by 38% compared to last year, reaching 18.4 million tons.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" believes that the new development of China's urban people's communes is important and will develop rapidly in the future.

    The newspaper also said that it is worth noting that in China's budget for this year, the proportion of defense spending has been reduced from 11.2% last year to 8.3%.

    However, while acknowledging the continued leap forward in China's construction, the newspaper also particularly emphasized that the rate of increase is lower than last year, especially the "smaller" growth rate of agriculture.

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" said that in the economic construction and financial reports made at the National People's Congress of China, the posture of high-speed development – "the Great Leap Forward" – has not disappeared. It believes that the 23% increase in the total industrial and agricultural output value this year, although less than the 31% of last year, "but if the factor of the expanded economic scale is taken into account, then it still cannot be said to be a low target." It said, "It is not an exaggeration to say it is a 'continuous leap forward'." It said, "The basic construction investment of 32.5 billion yuan is still a huge investment amount, and if local investment is added, it is 38.5 billion yuan, which is about 6 trillion Japanese yen when converted, from which one can also know the scale of construction."

    The newspaper also said that although the scale of finance has expanded, defense spending has not changed, which proves that China's reduction of troops is a fact.

    When talking about the progress of urban people's communes, the newspaper believes that China's "determination to reform society seems to be firm."

    However, the "Mainichi Shimbun" believes that the "reverse side of China's high-speed development is the continuous generation of imbalances."

    中国经济仍然在持续跃进
    城市人民公社将迅速发展
    日本报纸评我国今年国民经济计划和预算草案
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本许多报纸在报道中国二届二次全国人民代表大会会议上提出的1960年国民经济计划和预算草案时，认为中国在今年仍然是持续大跃进。
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”4月1日说，李富春的报告中说，中国工农业生产总值的增长率将比去年上升23％，这表明今年仍然是持续地跃进。报纸说，值得注意的是，“整个计划贯串着一个原则：‘进一步确定以农业为基础，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合’”，并且第一次提出城市人民公社有了进展。
    “赤旗报”指出，在李先念的报告中，值得注意的是：去年度的决算反映了经济繁荣，超过了当初的预算，有了近十四亿元人民币的盈余，收入预算的增加几乎完全是来自国营企业的收入，说明财政的基础已经巩固。报纸认为，用于经济、文化建设的支出预算占整个预算的80％以上，而国防费只占8.3％，说明这是一个从事和平的社会主义建设的预算。
    日本资产阶级几家大报也承认中国持续大跃进的速度。“朝日新闻”在1日说，这次大会第一天就宣布了中国在今年继续跃进的1960年度国民经济计划和预算草案，一开始就显得生气勃勃。
    这家报纸说，农业机械化在中国所以进展得这样快，说明中国的工业能力在建国十年以后已经获得了同现代国家的身份相称的实力。它说，这一点从下述情况也可以看出：今年钢块的生产将比去年增加38％，达到一千八百四十万吨。
    “朝日新闻”认为，中国城市人民公社的新发展是重要的，今后将迅速发展。
    这家报纸还说，值得注意的是，在中国今年度的预算中，国防费的比例已从去年的11.2％降低到8.3％。
    但是这家报纸在承认中国建设的继续跃进的同时，又特别强调上升速度低于去年，特别是农业的增长率“较小”。
    “每日新闻”说，在中国人民代表大会上所作的经济建设和财政报告中，高速度发展的姿态——“大跃进”，并没有消失。它认为今年工农业总产值增加23％，虽然不及去年的31％，“可是如果考虑到经济规模已经扩大了这个因素，那么，仍然不能不说是一个高指标”。它说，“即使说是‘连续跃进’也不是夸张”。它说，“基本建设投资三百二十五亿元仍是一笔巨大的投资额，如果加上地方投资，就是三百八十五亿元，换算成日本元就是约六万亿日元，从中也就可以知道建设规模之大”。
    这家报纸还说，尽管财政规模扩大了，而国防费没有变动，这证明了中国裁减兵力是事实。
    这家报纸在谈到城市人民公社的进展情况时认为，中国对“社会改革的决心好像是坚定的”。
    但是“每日新闻”认为，中国的“高速度发展的反面，不断产生不平衡”。
