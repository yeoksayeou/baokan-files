Foshan and Jishan Strive for Higher Standards in Pest Elimination and Disease Prevention

    Foshan City, Guangdong Province, a national city hygiene red banner, has its medical personnel going out of hospitals to widely publicize health knowledge to the masses in pest elimination and disease prevention, and a major sanitation campaign.

    In carrying out the patriotic health campaign, all medical institutions in the city, according to the instructions of the Foshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, dispatched 200 medical and health personnel to go deep into the streets to publicize health knowledge, and used neighborhood committees or streets as experimental fields for health work. Subsequently, they launched a district prevention and healthcare responsibility system throughout the city. Medical personnel from various medical institutions were dispatched full-time or part-time to neighborhood committees or streets every day to conduct prevention work and physical examinations for residents, provide emergency treatment for those with acute illnesses, manage infectious diseases in a timely manner, set up home sickbeds to treat some patients, and frequently conduct health knowledge publicity, mobilize the masses to eliminate the four pests and eradicate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, train "four members" (Red Cross health workers, cooks, cleaners, and childcare workers), and provide health guidance for collective welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and public canteens.

    In carrying out district prevention and healthcare work, medical personnel also jointly established spare-time hygiene schools with neighborhood committees, regularly giving hygiene lessons to residents. They also worked with health group leaders and activists in the neighborhood to investigate mosquito and fly breeding grounds and mobilize the masses to deal with them, household by household.

    Red Cross health workers and epidemic voluntary reporters trained by medical personnel have now become capable assistants to medical personnel in district prevention and healthcare work. The Red Cross health stations that are now generally established in the city's streets are staffed by health workers who volunteer on a rotating basis. They can generally treat minor injuries and illnesses for the masses, and some can also perform prenatal check-ups for pregnant women and treat trachoma. Epidemic voluntary reporters have also played a significant role in realizing the "five earlies" (early prevention, early detection, early reporting, early treatment, and early isolation) of infectious disease management.

    Jishan County, Shanxi Province, a national rural hygiene red banner county, is pushing the mass patriotic health movement to a new stage of a comprehensive revolution in living habits and the safety and hygiene of production processes. At the end of March, the Jishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received the central government's instructions on vigorously carrying out the spring hygiene campaign. After studying the current production situation and the hygiene movement situation, it believed that: whether from the perspective of hygiene work itself or striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton production this year, it was imperative to guide the hygiene movement toward higher standards. The county party committee immediately called on the people of the county to take action to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day with a full house in both hygiene and production. Subsequently, it successively put forward tasks including household revolution, window revolution, clothing revolution, and snack revolution, setting off one climax after another throughout the county. A rapid realization of one determination (regular large-scale moving, sweeping, brushing, and tidying), two clearings (clearing all waste products, clearing away superstitious remnants), three beautifications (greening around homes, perfuming courtyards, beautifying homes), and four increases (fly swatters, spittoons, washbasins, cross-ventilation windows). A large amount of waste products in the commune members' families were cleared out. Every family established a storage room, and every team had a custody warehouse. Even a batch of small statues of gods and clay figures that had not been taken out of the house for more than ten years since liberation were all repainted in this movement and became toys for children in kindergartens. The "nutritional recipes" were generally promoted in more than 2,000 rural public canteens throughout the county. The development of hygiene work towards higher standards has promoted the vigorous development of sports. Until recently, there have been more than 900 exercise teams and more than 600 representative teams, and the number of people regularly participating in physical exercise has reached more than 200,000.

    The most significant achievement of the leap forward of hygiene work to higher standards in Jishan County is that the national hygiene movement has been combined with the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement, moving towards the safety and hygiene of the production process. In the process of the entire people taking action and advancing towards high hygiene standards, Jishan County has also further improved and raised the original rural health care work. The county organized a 19,000-person improvement and cleaning professional team, which improved more than 3,500 toilets, pigsties, and public canteens in half a month, built 16 new rural bathhouses and 178 composting yards, and opened up more than 5,900 street gardens and courtyard flower pools.

    佛山稷山除害灭病迈向高标准
    本报讯　全国城市卫生红旗——广东省佛山市的医务人员，在除害灭病、大搞卫生运动中，走出医院大门，向群众广泛宣传卫生知识。
    在开展爱国卫生运动中，全市各个医疗机构根据中共佛山市委的指示，抽调了卫生医药人员二百人深入到街道中进行卫生知识宣传，并以居民委员会或街道作为卫生工作试验田。接着又在全市开展地段预防保健负责制，各医疗机构派出脱产或半脱产的医务人员每天到居民委员会或街道为居民进行预防工作和检查体格，对急病者进行抢救，对传染病及时管理，除设立家庭病床为一些病人治疗外，还经常开展卫生知识的宣传，发动群众除四害、消灭蚊蝇孳生地，培训“四员”（红十字会卫生员、炊事员、保洁员、保育员），并对托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、公共食堂等集体福利事业给予卫生指导。
    在开展地段预防保健工作中，医务人员还与居民委员会合办业余卫生学校。定期给居民上卫生课。还和街坊的卫生组长、积极分子一起，逐家逐户对蚊蝇孳生地进行调查和发动群众处理。
    由医务人员培训出来的红十字会卫生员、疫情义务报告员等，现在都成了医务人员在地段预防保健工作中的得力助手。全市街道现在普遍设立的红十字会卫生站，都由卫生员义务轮流值班，他们一般都可以为群众医治一些轻伤小病，有的还可以为孕妇作产前检查，医治沙眼等工作。疫情义务报告员对实现传染病管理的“五早”（早预防、早发现、早报告、早治疗、早隔离）也起了很大作用。
    本报讯　全国农村卫生红旗县——山西省稷山县，把群众性的爱国卫生运动推向了生活习惯全面大革命、生产过程安全化和卫生化的新阶段。3月底，中共稷山县委接到中央关于大张旗鼓开展春季卫生运动的指示，研究了当时的生产形势和卫生运动形势之后，认为：不论从卫生工作本身，还是争取今年粮棉生产大丰收方面考虑，把卫生运动引导向高标准发展已经刻不容缓。县委立即号召全县群众行动起来，以卫生、生产满堂红迎接“五一”国际劳动节。接着又连续提出了包括家庭革命，窗户革命，服装革命，零食革命等任务，全县掀起了一个接一个的高潮。迅速实现了一定（定期大搬，大扫，大刷，大整理）、二清（清理一切废品，清理迷信残余）、三化（宅旁绿化，院里香化，家里美化）、四增加（蝇拍，痰盂，流洗器，对流窗）。社员家庭里的大量废品被清除出来。家家建立储藏室，队队设有代管库。连解放十几年来一直没有出户的一批小神像、泥胎，也在这次运动中全部粉刷一新，成为幼儿园里孩子们的玩具。全县两千多个农村公共食堂普遍推广了“营养食谱”。卫生工作向高标准发展，推动了体育运动蓬勃展开。到  最近为止，已有九百多个锻炼队和六百多个代表队，经常参加体育锻炼的人数已达二十万人以上。
    稷山县卫生工作向高标准跃进最显著的成就，是全民的卫生运动已经和全民的技术革新与技术革命运动结合起来，向生产过程安全化、卫生化迈进。在全民动手，向卫生高标准前进中，稷山县也进一步改善和提高了原有的农村卫生保健工作。全县组织了一万九千人的改良、清除专业队，在半个月中改良了厕所、猪圈和公共食堂三千五百多个，新建了十六个农村澡堂和一百七十八个沤肥场，开辟了五千九百多个街心花园和庭院花池。
