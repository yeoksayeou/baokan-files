	Early Spring in Huaibei, Torrential Heat Waves, Catching Up with Jiangnan, Red Flags Fluttering Across the Fields, If You Want to Know About This Year's Bumper Grain Harvest, Look at:
	The Wheat Sea of Xuzhou, Waves Running High, Written Collectively by the Xuzhou Area Correspondence Group

	Tens of Thousands of Mu of Wheat Fields Connected into Squares,
	The Azure Waves Ripple Like an Ocean,
	Careful Management to Strive for High Yields,
	Vowing to Seize a Bumper Harvest and Cross the Yangtze River.

	The six million people of the Xuzhou area in Jiangsu, on the Huaibei Plain, have made a lofty aspiration: "Great Battle in 1960, develop all five industries, achieve 1,000 catties of grain, 100 yuan of money, cross the Huai River, and catch up with Jiangnan!"

	A Good Seedling Situation

	This year, the Xuzhou Special Zone has planted a total of 8 million mu of wheat, an expansion of more than 2 million mu compared to last year. Now, from the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east to the shores of Weishan Lake in the west, there is a good seedling situation everywhere, winning the praise of ten thousand people!

	The "Big Water Ladle" area of 90,000 mu in Donghai County used to be a place where "flocks of geese flew, wild rabbits ran all over the lake, no crops grew, only grass grew, it was either drought or flood." What about now? "Rivers and ditches are in rows, the wind blows the wheat seedlings, and waves run high, patches of wheat sea connect to the sky, the 'Big Water Ladle' has become a 'Rice and Flour Ladle'." The wheat high-yield area in Ganyu County covers 80,000 mu in one piece; and in Pixian County, there are even 100,000 mu of wheat connected together, when the wind rises, the azure waves ripple, and the seedlings are knee-deep. In the Wangji mountainous area of Suining County in the south, before liberation, it was full of jagged rocks and barren grass. "The mountainous area is bitter, the mountainous area is difficult, afraid of both floods and droughts, if a daughter marries a man from the mountains, tears will never dry." The lingering sound of this sad folk song is still in the ears, but a miraculous miracle has already appeared. The heroic people of Wangji have diverted water over the five-meter-high Zhahe Weir, letting 30,000 mu of wheat drink its fill of "jade nectar." Now, large areas of wheat seedlings are "when the wind blows, they become waves, when the sun shines, they gleam with oil, the seedlings are taller than small reeds, and the color is like green onions."

	In fact, it's not just these. Whether it is the relatively good soil around Weishan Lake, or the historically barren banks of the old Yellow River course; whether it is the sandy wasteland where "a gust of wind blows, and the roots of the wheat seedlings are exposed," or the saline-alkali areas where "the sun shines, and the ground is covered with white frost"; whether it is a large area connecting tens of thousands of mu, or a small area of several thousand mu or several hundred mu; whether it is basic farmland or general farmland, early stubble or late stubble, distant land or nearby land, the wheat seedlings are all a patch of lush green, and the plants are strong.

	The masses in the suburbs of Xuzhou City compared the growth of wheat this year with previous years and said: "In previous years, the vernal equinox saw bare ground, but this year, the vernal equinox saw wheat filling the ridges; in previous years, the wheat fields were mottled, but this year, the wheat seedlings were neatly cut; in previous years, the seedlings stood up at Qingming, but this year, they are two feet deep." The members of the Zhuji Commune in Suining County composed a ditty and sang: Before liberation, the wheat had not yet been harvested, first worried about rent and taxes, second worried about disasters, third worried about where to flee famine; this year, the wheat has not yet been harvested, first worried about the wheat being too dense and the stalks being too thick to harvest, second worried about the lack of large warehouses, and third worried about not having so many carts to sell the surplus grain. The worries are the same, but the worries are different!

	To Catch Up with Jiangnan, Wheat Leads the Way

	To catch up with Jiangnan, wheat leads the way. The competition to have low yields catch up with high yields, late stubble catch up with early stubble, distant land catch up with nearby land, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings has continuously pushed wheat field management to a climax. The Pixian County Party Committee organized 30 to 40 Party Committee secretaries from various communes to go to Jiangnan twice to seek "experience" and "treasure," and proposed to the people of the county to "learn from Yangzhou, catch up with Yangzhou, and surpass Yangzhou," promoting the wheat in the county to ride the wind and waves, continuously upgrade, and become a pacesetter in the entire special zone. Ganyu, Pei, Tongshan, Donghai and other counties have successively proposed "surpassing Pixian and catching up with Yangzhou," making the wheat field management competition flourish and sweep the entire area. Within each county and commune, there are also their own "little Jiangnans," like locomotives taking the lead, driving all the communes and teams to surge forward.

	"Tens of thousands of mu of wheat sea, red flags flying, fighting for the first pass of wheat, you catch up with me and I help you, working together to catch up with Jiangnan," the spirit of continuous revolution has enabled people's subjective initiative to be brought into full play; the lofty communist style is sweeping away the remnants of the old small-peasant economy ideology. Zhuyou Brigade and Zhaoheya Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Fengxian County are closely connected. Zhaoheya Brigade has always had high yields, while Zhuyou Brigade has poor soil, a weak foundation, and has always had very low yields. In this year's wheat field management, Zhuyou Brigade is determined to catch up with Zhaoheya Brigade, while Zhaoheya Brigade is determined to maintain the high-yield red flag and go to a higher level. So a tense competition began: when Zhaoheya Brigade saw Zhuyou Brigade topdressing, they also topdressed; when Zhuyou Brigade saw Zhaoheya Brigade watering, they also watered; your measures are increased, and my measures are increased even more; promoting each other and not yielding to each other. However, in the competition, they are not only opponents but also helpers. When Zhaoheya Brigade saw that Zhuyou Brigade lacked water sources, they built canals all the way to the head of Zhuyou Brigade to help them water; and they supported Zhuyou Brigade with a complete set of equipment for a machine well and a ready-made manure cart. Now, the growth of wheat seedlings in Zhuyou Brigade has not only caught up with but also surpassed Zhaoheya Brigade. Seeing that Zhuyou Brigade has caught up with them, the members of Zhaoheya Brigade happily said: "Your bumper harvest is also our bumper harvest; one brigade becoming rich is not the goal, everyone becoming rich is happiness." Zhuyou Brigade was deeply moved by the selfless assistance of Zhaoheya Brigade. Seeing that the wheat in a test field of Zhaoheya Brigade needed loosening the soil, they took the initiative to organize manpower to help loosen the soil.

	On the banks of the Bulao River in the Dawu Commune in the suburbs of Xuzhou City, such a good story is also circulating: The Pan'an Brigade, which has low yields on the north bank of the Bulao River, proposed the slogan "Hebei catches up with Henan" and competed with the Huli Brigade in Henan; however, when the Huli Brigade was allocated 5,000 catties of chemical fertilizer, they immediately gave it to the Pan'an Brigade to help them catch up with them. Now, whether it is Hebei or Henan, the wheat seedlings are equally vigorous.

	Such examples are endless in the wheat field management of the entire area. Each county, commune, and team wants to strive for the top and win the red flag, but they do not want a brother unit to fall behind. Competing and helping each other to strive for high yields, working together to catch up with Jiangnan.

	Third-Class Seedlings Soar Upwards

	In wheat field management, the people of Xuzhou Special Zone regard continuously attacking third-class seedlings as an important link in winning an all-round bumper harvest.

	One afternoon in late March, the sky became gloomy. Before long, it started to rain lightly. Xia Ruiran, Deputy Secretary of the Zhuji Commune Party Committee in Suining County, was discussing with several cadres in the Xianfeng Brigade how to eliminate third-class seedlings. Seeing it was raining, he immediately thought that watering after applying chemical fertilizer in the past had a good effect. Wouldn't it be even better to apply chemical fertilizer in the rain? After discussing it with the brigade cadres, they picked up the chemical fertilizer and ran to the fields. When the members saw the Party Committee secretary applying fertilizer to the third-class seedlings in the rain, they all took the initiative to come. At this time, the rain became heavier and heavier, but people became more and more enthusiastic. The members said: "As long as people are here, third-class seedlings are not allowed to be here!" "We will resolutely not let the third-class seedlings hold us back!" After five or six days, this third-class seedling that had been fertilized quickly caught up with the first-class seedling. This is how the people of Xuzhou Special Zone regard applying chemical fertilizer in the rain as a good medicine for treating third-class seedlings. In the past, they ran home when it rained, but now they run to the fields when it rains!

	"Late stubble is not late sowing," "Eliminate third-class seedlings before sowing" is another revolutionary measure. As early as before the autumn sowing last year, the people of the entire area were working on eliminating third-class seedlings. In large areas of late-stubble land, in the morning, the mature autumn crops in the lake were still waiting to be harvested; at night, high-standard wheat ridge fields had already appeared. Some were harvesting, deep-plowing, and sowing at the same time; others were adding fertilizer and turning it over, making the wheat "rich from the womb." The professional team for transforming late-stubble land in Nanmen Brigade of Haizhou Commune in Xin Hai Lian City set up camp in the saline-alkali land to process and plant; Gaozuo Commune in Suining County changed the habit of applying dry fertilizer as base fertilizer, and applied 20,000 catties of fermented local and miscellaneous fertilizer per mu on late-stubble land. As a result, the number of third-class seedlings in the entire area decreased from the same period last year from the beginning.

	Although the number of third-class seedlings has decreased, the people of the entire area are not complacent. They launched attacks one after another, eliminating one mu if there is one mu, and eliminating one piece if there is one piece!

	Not only working hard, but also working skillfully, in the campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings, new methods and new experiences are blooming everywhere like hundreds of flowers in spring. This spring, Ganyu County had 110,000 mu of third-class seedlings that needed early topdressing. At that time, spring sowing was about to begin, and farm work was squeezed together. How to solve the labor problem while grasping wheat well and doing a good job in spring sowing? Peng Xiaolian, Minister of the Agricultural and Industrial Department of the County Party Committee, led a work team to the Dianzi Brigade of Zhudu Commune to ask the masses for advice. Zhang Deqing, a member with rich production experience, suggested: "In the past, I have seen water manure fertilizer applied in Jiangnan. Can we use the conditions of gravity irrigation to combine irrigation and fertilization?" Inspired by him, Comrade Peng Xiaolian personally dug a fertilization pond at the mouth of the channel in the field, put in fertilizer, and opened the gate of gravity irrigation. Water and manure flowed into the wheat fields along the large and small channels. The technician saw the trick from it again, he said: "While irrigating and fertilizing, wouldn't it be better to combine it with watering poisonous water to eliminate pests?" So "two combinations" became "three combinations," saving a lot of labor.

	Go Deep into Reality, Command Production

	In the days and nights of wheat field management, cadres at all levels of the region, county, commune, and team have always stood on the front line, participating in production and leading production. They are not only commanders but also combatants, technicians, and propagandists. On the night of March 30, the cold wind became tighter and tighter. It was rare to have such cold weather during the Qingming season for many years. Comrade Bao Youcheng, Secretary of the Xinyi County Party Committee, felt that the weather had suddenly turned cold while checking work in the countryside in the evening, and that there might be frost the next day. He immediately rushed back to the county and discussed it with the technicians. The technicians suggested using the method of smoking to prevent frost. He personally carried a bundle of weeds, lit them on the upwind side of the wheat field to smoke, and suddenly, wisps of green smoke enveloped the earth, and the temperature above the wheat field no longer dropped. The experiment was successful. At more than two o'clock in the morning, he held a radio conference to mobilize the people of the county to take action and smoke in the fields to prevent late frost. That night, from the county party secretary to the cadres of the communes, brigades, and production teams, they were all fighting through the night.

	In fact, how many sleepless nights have the broad masses of cadres in the entire special zone spent! That was another night, pitch black and invisible. In a field on the 100,000-mu wheat high-yield area in Pi County, a person was lying on the ground checking the wheat stalks with a flashlight. He was Mao Xiling, a cadre of the Seventh Production Team of the Guanhai Commune Qijia Brigade. Because of the discovery of dead seedlings in this field of wheat, everyone in the team was anxious. Topdressing was not effective. Was it a pest? However, after checking for two days, no moths were seen, and even no insect eggs were found. Mao Xiling was responsible for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and he decided to conduct a night reconnaissance. Just as he squatted down and turned on the light to observe, he heard a "swoosh" sound, and something fell in front of him. Before he could take a closer look, two more "swoosh, swoosh" fell beside him. It turned out that mole crickets had flown over to the light. The secret of the dead wheat seedlings was finally found. The next day, he mobilized the members to stir-fry soybean cakes, garlic seeds, and fragrant bait, mix them with medicine and sprinkle them on the wheat ridges. When they went to see it again the next night, there were dead mole crickets all over the ground. The mole crickets were eliminated, and the wheat seedlings were saved.

	In order to seize a bumper wheat harvest, the Party organizations at all levels in the Xuzhou area sent a large number of the strongest cadres to the areas that were originally low-yielding, to the poor teams, and to the places where there were many third-class seedlings to organize mass movements to have the backward catch up with the advanced and have the low-yield catch up with the high-yield.

	The Party committees at all levels and all the people in the Xuzhou area regard the current good seedling situation as the initial foundation for striving for a bumper wheat harvest. But they are by no means satisfied with this. They continue to exert more effort and think of more ways to ensure a bumper harvest.

    淮北春早，热浪滔滔，赶江南，遍野红旗飘，欲知今年粮食丰收事，且看：
    徐州麦海逐浪高徐州地区通讯组集体采写
    万顷麦田连成方，
    碧波荡漾似海洋，
    精细管理争高产，
    誓夺丰收跨长江。
    淮北平原上的江苏徐州地区六百万人民，立下凌云壮志：“大战1960年，五业全发展，实现粮食千斤，钱百元，跨淮河，赶江南。”
     一派好苗势
    今年徐州专区共种三麦八百万亩，比去年扩大了二百多万亩。现在东起黄海之滨，西至微山湖畔，一派好苗势，赢得了万人称颂！
    东海县一片九万亩的“大水瓢”，过去是“大雁成群飞，野兔满湖跑，不长庄稼光长草，不是旱来就是涝。”现在呢？“河道沟渠一条条，风吹麦苗逐浪高，片片麦海接天际，‘大水瓢’变成‘米面瓢’”。赣榆县的三麦丰产片，一片八万亩；邳县更有十万亩三麦连成片，风乍起，碧波荡漾，苗深膝盖上。南部睢宁县的王集山区，解放前是山石峥嵘，遍野草荒。“山区苦，山区难，又怕涝，又怕旱，有女嫁给山上汉，一年到头泪不干。”这首辛酸的民谣，余声在耳，那神话般的奇迹已经出现。英雄的王集人民，把水引过五米高的闸河堰，让三万亩三麦喝饱了“琼浆玉液”。现在大片的麦苗是“风儿一吹成波浪，太阳一照油光光，苗棵赛过小芦苇，颜色就跟葱一样。”
    其实，何止这些。不论是土质较好的微山湖畔，还是一向贫瘠的黄河故道沿岸；不论是“大风刮一阵，麦苗露出根”的沙荒地带，还是“太阳晒一晒，满地盖白霜”的盐碱地区；不论是连接几万亩的大片，还是几千亩、几百亩的小片；不论是基本田还是一般田，早茬还是晚茬，远地还是近地，麦苗都是一片葱绿，植株健壮。
    徐州市郊群众对比今年和往年三麦生长情况说：“往年春分见白地，今年春分麦满畦；往年麦田花牛皮，今年麦苗一斩齐；往年清明苗起身，今年清明深两尺。”睢宁县朱集公社社员编了一段顺口溜唱道：解放前，麦子未登场，一愁租税二愁灾，三愁哪里去逃荒；今年是，麦子未登场，一愁麦稠秆粗难收割，二愁缺少大仓房，三愁没有这么多的车子卖余粮。同样有三愁，三愁却不一样！
    要赶江南　三麦领先
    要赶江南，三麦领先。低产赶高产、晚茬赶早茬、远地赶近地、三类苗赶一类苗的竞赛运动，把麦田管理不断推向高潮。邳县县委组织各公社党委书记三、四十人，两下江南，求“经”取“宝”，向全县人民提出“学扬中，赶扬中，超扬中”，促进了全县三麦乘风破浪，不断升级，成为全专区标兵。赣榆、沛县、铜山、东海等县，纷纷提出了“超邳县，赶扬中”，使麦田管理竞赛风起云涌，席卷全区。在各县、各公社内，又都有自己的“小江南”，像火车头似的一马当先，带动了各社、各队，万马奔腾。
    “万顷麦海红旗翻，奋战三麦第一关，你赶我来我帮你，携手并进赶江南”，不断革命的精神，使人们的主观能动性得到了最充分的发挥；崇高的共产主义风格，横扫着残存的小农经济旧思想。丰县城关公社朱窑大队和赵河崖大队，紧紧相连，赵河崖大队历来产量高，而朱窑大队土质差、底子薄、产量一向很低，今年麦田管理中，朱窑队立志要赶上赵河崖队，而赵河崖队要坚决保住高产红旗，更上一层楼。于是一场紧张的竞赛开始了：赵河崖队看到朱窑队追肥，他们也追肥；朱窑队看到赵河崖队灌水，他们也灌水；你的措施加码，我的措施更加码；互相促进，各不相让。但是，他们在竞赛中既是对手，也是帮手。赵河崖队看到朱窑队水源不足，便把渠道一直筑到朱窑队地头，帮他们灌水；并支援朱窑队一眼机井的全套设备和做好的水粪车。现在朱窑队的麦苗长势，不仅赶上并且超过了赵河崖队。赵河崖队社员看到朱窑队赶上自己，高兴地说：“你们的丰收，也就是我们的丰收；一队富裕不是目的，大家富裕才是幸福。”朱窑队对赵河崖队的无私援助，深为感动，看到赵河崖队的一块试验场的麦子需要松土，便主动组织人力帮助松土。
    在徐州市郊大吴公社的不牢河畔，也流传着这样一段佳话：不牢河北岸低产的潘安大队提出“河北赶河南”的口号，和河南的湖里大队竞赛；但是，当湖里大队分到五千斤化肥时，马上让给潘安大队，帮助他们赶上自己。现在不论是河北、河南，麦苗都是一样旺盛。
    像这样的事例，在全区麦田管理中，说不完，也道不尽。各县、各社、各队，个个都想争上游，夺红旗，但又不愿有一个兄弟单位掉队。又赛又帮争高产，携手并进赶江南。
    三类苗扶摇直上
    徐州专区人民在麦田管理中，都把不断猛攻三类苗作为夺取全面丰产的重要环节。
    3月下旬的一个下午，天变得阴沉了。不一会，淅淅下起雨来。睢宁县的朱集公社党委副书记夏瑞然同志，正在先锋大队和几个干部商量怎样消灭三类苗，看到下雨，他马上想起过去试验追过化肥后浇水，效果良好，如果乘雨追化肥，效果不是更好吗？他和队干部一商量，挑起化肥就往田里跑。社员们看到党委书记冒雨给三类苗追肥，都主动赶来。这时雨越下越大，但人们却越干越热火。社员们说：“人在就不叫三类苗在！”“坚决不让三类苗扯腿！”过了五、六天，这块追过化肥的三类苗，迅速赶上了一类苗。徐州专区人民就是这样把冒雨追化肥看成是医治三类苗的良药。过去是下雨往家里跑，现在是下雨往田里跑啊！
    “晚茬不晚种”，“把三类苗消灭在播种前”这又是一项革命措施。早在去年秋种前，全区人民就在着手消灭三类苗了。在大片晚茬地里，早晨，满湖的秋熟庄稼还在等人收割；夜晚，高标准的小麦畦田已经出现。有的是边收割、边深翻、边下种；有的是肥料加翻，做到麦子“胎里富”。新海连市海州公社南门大队改造晚茬地的专业队，在盐碱地上安营扎寨，加工种植；睢宁县高作公社改变了底肥施干肥的习惯，在晚茬地上，每亩都施上二万斤经过沤制的土杂肥。这样一来，全区三类苗一开始就比去年同期减少了。
    三类苗是减少了，但全区人民并没有自满。他们一次接一次的开展猛攻，有一亩消灭一亩，有一块消灭一块！
    不仅苦干，而且巧干，在突击消灭三类苗的运动中，新办法，新经验就像春天的百花，到处盛开。赣榆县在今春有十一万亩三类苗需要提前追肥，当时春种就要开始，农活挤在一起，既要抓好三麦，又要搞好春种，劳力怎样解决呢？县委农工部长彭孝廉同志带了工作组来到朱堵公社店子大队，向群众请教。富有生产经验的社员张德庆献计说：“过去我在江南看过追水粪肥，咱们能不能利用自流灌溉的条件，让灌水和追肥结合起来呢？”彭孝廉同志在他的启发下，亲自到地头渠道口开挖一个追肥塘，放进肥料，把自流灌溉的闸门一开放，水和粪沿着大小渠道流进麦田。技术员从中又看到了窍门，他说：“在灌水肥的同时，如果结合浇毒水，消灭虫害，不是更好吗？”于是“两结合”又变成“三结合”，节省了大批劳动力。
    深入实际　指挥生产
    在麦田管理的日日夜夜里，地、县、社、队各级干部始终站在第一线，参加生产，领导生产，他们既是指挥员，又是战斗员、技术员和宣传员。3月30日的夜里，寒风一阵紧似一阵，清明时节的气候这样冷，真是多年罕见。新沂县委书记鲍有成同志，晚上在乡下检查工作，感到气候骤冷，第二天可能发生霜冻。他立刻赶回县里，和技术员一起商量，技术员建议用熏烟的办法防霜。他就亲自抱了一捆杂草，放在麦田上风头点火熏烟，顿时，缕缕青烟笼罩大地，麦田上部气温不再降低了，试验成功了。深夜两点多钟，他就召开了广播大会，动员全县人民齐上阵，田头熏烟防晚霜。这天夜里，从县委书记起，到公社、大队、生产队的干部，都是通宵达旦，进行战斗。
    其实，全专区广大干部又何止熬过这一个不眠之夜！那是另一个夜晚，黑糊糊的伸手不见五指。在邳县十万亩三麦丰产片上的一块田里，有一个人伏在地上打着手电筒检查麦棵。他就是官湖公社祁家大队第七生产队干部毛希岭。为了这块麦子发现死苗现象，全队人人都焦心，追肥不顶事，是虫害吗？可是查了两个白天，虫蛾没看见，连虫卵都没有找到一点。毛希岭是负责防治病虫害的，他决心来一个夜间侦察。当他刚蹲下来打开电筒观察，只听“嗖”的一声，有一件东西落在跟前，还没有来得及瞧个仔细，又是“嗖，嗖”两个落在身旁。原来是蝼蛄见亮飞来。麦子死棵的秘密终于找到了。第二天他就动员社员炒了豆饼、蒜种、香饵料，拌药撒在麦垅上，过一夜再去看，地面上一片死蝼蛄。蝼蛄消灭了，麦苗得救了。
    为了夺取三麦大丰收，徐州地区的各级党组织，把大批最强的干部派到原来是低产的地区去，派到穷队去，派到三类苗多的地方去，组织落后赶先进、低产赶高产的群众运动。
    徐州地区各级党委和全体人民，他们把当前良好的苗势，看做争取三麦大丰收的初步基础。但他们决不满足这些，还继续在出更大的力，想更多的办法，保证丰收。
