The industrial and commercial sectors are vigorously promoting irrigation machinery to support water lifting and drought resistance in various regions.

    This newspaper reports that the industrial, commercial, and other relevant departments in Gansu Province are adopting a two-pronged approach of tapping existing potential and seeking external assistance to vigorously promote water lifting and irrigation machinery. This supports the province's ongoing vigorous campaign to utilize groundwater, ensuring an even greater harvest in agricultural production. By the end of March, the province had 835 units of power-driven water lifting machinery with over 33,900 horsepower, more than 14,000 Liberation-style waterwheels, and more than 36,600 simple water lifting tools投入into irrigation. This has accelerated the province's irrigation speed and powerfully supported the struggle against drought. Currently, a large number of power-driven water lifting and irrigation machines are being transferred to Gansu.

    Since the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to urgently mobilize the entire party and all the people to deeply develop the drought resistance production movement and achieve "large production increase without rain, and a large harvest in a major drought," the people in the arid regions of the province, in the spirit of "combining storage, diversion, and lifting, and grasping all three sources of water," have launched a high tide of water conservancy construction by digging wells, tapping springs, and intercepting underground undercurrents to fully utilize groundwater. To support this movement, the Provincial Economic Commission, the Provincial Bureau of Mechanical Industry, the Agricultural Machinery Bureau, and other relevant departments immediately adopted four measures:

    First, vigorously promote production. The province has designated 15 larger machinery factories to undertake the production of water lifting and irrigation equipment. Relevant departments are using methods such as assigning responsibility by area, stationing personnel in factories, and conducting巡回inspections to督促urge production. Leading cadres and technicians from the 15 factories are going deep into the workshops to抓grasp both quantity and quality, and are mobilizing workers to突击speed up production. By March 25th, the province had produced more than 700 water pumps, more than 1,100 waterwheels, more than 6,000 water pipes, and a batch of diesel engines and electric motors. Second, vigorously promote the inspection and matching of water lifting machinery to put them into irrigation as early as possible. In addition to organizing 30 well-equipped factories to rush repair parts for water lifting tools, the province also organized more than 4,000 technical workers to go to the countryside to inspect and repair existing water lifting machinery, and to传授impart the technology of water lifting machinery maintenance and use to farmers. Third, vigorously promote inventory clearance. Commercial, industrial, transportation and other departments throughout the province actively清仓查库check inventories and warehouses, and clear out machinery and accessories related to drought resistance production to provide support. From February 16 to March 20, the commercial sector alone throughout the province (still lacking statistics from the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) cleared out power machinery such as diesel engines,锅驼机locomotive boilers, and electric motors totaling 10,623 horsepower, as well as a large number of water pumps, water pipes, rubber hoses, and waterwheels. Fourth, industrial and mining enterprises in cities such as Baiyin, Yumen, Jiuquan, Tianshui, and Zhangye are adopting methods such as factory-commune pairing and assigning responsibility by area to help communes in various places build large-scale water lifting and irrigation projects in terms of materials and technology.

    工商业部门大抓灌溉机械
    支援各地提水抗旱
    本报讯　甘肃省的工业、商业等有关部门采用挖掘现有潜力和争取外援两条腿走路办法，大抓提水灌溉机械，支援各地正在轰轰烈烈开展的利用地下水运动，以保证农业生产的更大丰收。到3月底全省已有八百三十五台、三万三千九百多马力的动力提水机械，一万四千多部解放式水车和三万六千六百多部简易提水工具投入灌溉，加快了全省的灌溉速度，有力地支援了抗旱生产斗争。目前，还有大批提水灌溉动力机械正源源调入甘肃。
    自从中共甘肃省委发出全党全民紧急动员起来，深入开展抗旱生产运动，实现“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”的号召后，全省各干旱地区的人民，本着“蓄引提并举，三水齐抓”的精神，掀起了一个打井、掏泉、截引地下潜流充分利用地下水的兴修水利高潮。为了支援这一运动，省经济委员会、省机械工业局、农业机械局和商业等有关部门立即采取四项措施：
    第一，大抓生产。全省预定十五个较大的机械厂担负提水灌溉设备的生产任务，有关部门采用分片包干、驻厂扎点和巡回检查等办法督促生产。十五个工厂的领导干部和技术人员，深入车间既抓产量又抓质量，发动工人突击生产。到3月25日，全省已生产出七百多台水泵、一千一百多部水车、六千多根水管和一批柴油机、电动机。第二，大抓提水机具的检修和配套，使之及早投入灌溉。全省除组织三十个设备齐全的工厂赶修提水工具的配件以外，还组织了四千多名技术工人下乡检修现有提水机具，并把提水机械检修保养和使用技术传授给农民。第三，大抓清仓。全省各地商业、工业、交通等部门积极清仓查库，清出有关抗旱生产的机具和配件进行支援。从2月16日到3月20日，全省仅商业部门（尚缺甘南藏族自治州的统计）就清出柴油机、锅驼机、电动机等动力机械达一万零六百二十三马力，还有大批水泵、水管、胶管和水车。第四，白银、玉门、酒泉、天水、张掖等城市的工矿企业，采用厂社挂钩，分片包干等办法，从物资、技术等方面帮助各地公社大建提水灌溉工程。
