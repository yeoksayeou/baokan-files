Lyrics on Governing the Rivers and Mountains
Liu Yeqing, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Ten years of construction, two years of Great Leap Forward,
	Managing mountains, managing lakes, managing water.
We want the mountain land to be free from drought, the lake land to be free from flooding,
	Managing the mountains and waters, lake waters, and river waters, all together.
For several years, we have vigorously developed water conservancy, the Party calls, establishing great ambitions,
	Leading water up the mountains with extraordinary ingenuity.
Large and small, reservoirs are all over the mountain gullies,
	Like vines and melons, canals crisscross,
	Self-flowing irrigation becomes a harmonious union.
From now on, even if heavy rain pours down, continuous overcast days persist,
	Mountain floods will not erupt, dragons will not rise.
Water flows from ten thousand valleys and thousand cliffs,
	We will, confine it, in the, deep mountains.

Since ancient times, the Yangtze and Han Rivers, giant waves surging for thousands of miles,
	Flooding fields and houses, drowning people and livestock, its harm is incomparable.
Fu River, Huan River, She River, Lu River, Fu River, Ju River, Dao River,
	Ju Zhang River twists westward, many rivers, hard to count. (Note 1)
Remembering the past, whenever encountering fierce winds and heavy rains,
	Lakes and rivers would rise together, breaking dikes and collapsing banks,
	The water势汪洋 (vastness of water), allowing fish and dragons to stir up the bottom of the sea,
	The wind howls, the rain drizzles,
	Five grains are not harvested, swallows leave their nests, people have nowhere to dwell.
Tragic events, how can they be recorded?
Now great joy! Human power turns the world around,
	Rivers and mountains are governed together.
North, South, East, and West, the entire province's river basins are planned,
	Jinghan flood diversion has already benefited.
Building dams to block rivers, repairing embankments and building sluices,
	Moving mountains and overturning seas, driving soil and transporting stones,
	Key projects, and hydroelectric power stations are also established.
Flood control and power generation, irrigation and transportation,
	Comprehensive utilization, and eliminating thousands of years of worries.
Danjiangkou, the dam site stands majestically,
	The Three Gorges Project is also being planned,
We want a hundred rivers to obey orders, ten thousand waters and thousand mountains, all to obey commands.

Ancient heroes praised Yu the Great,
	"Without Yu, we would be fish!" (Note 2)
In reality, it is the ingenuity of nature, all relying on the power of the people.
The people's power is greater than the sky, the people's power surpasses gods and ghosts.
Look at the changes in a few years, are they not the result of human power?
The old world is transformed into a new world, the individual is transformed into the collective,
The Eight-Character Constitution (referring to the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture) displays great power,
	Producing countless miracles,
Governing water conservancy is just one aspect of it.
Industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries,
	People's communes are all undertaken together,
Socialism shines brightly, illuminating the human world.
Let's see heroes from all directions gather, competing to show off their heroic spirit,
The great cause of production will all be,
	Exotic flowers and strange colors, unpredictable.

Note 1: All are river names in Hubei Province.
Note 2: Confucius praised Yu's achievements in water management, a saying from the Zuo Zhuan.

    治江山词
    政协全国委员会委员　柳野青
    十年建设，两年跃进，
    管山，管湖，管水。
    要山地不旱，湖地不淹，
    把山水、湖水、河水，统都管起。
    几年大兴水利，党号召，立大志，
    引水上山出奇智。
    大大小小，水库遍山沟，
    牵藤结瓜，渠道纵横，
    自流灌溉成连理。
    从今始，纵大雨倾盆，连阴累日，
    山洪不暴，蛟龙不起。
    万壑千崖水溜至，
    都把它，约束在，深山里。
    自古长江汉水，巨浪滔滔千里，
    漂没田庐，淹毙人畜，其害无可比。
    府河、澴、滠，陆、富、举、倒，
    沮漳西迆?，许多河，难尽数。（注1）
    记从前在昔，一遇恶风暴雨，
    湖河并涨，破堤倒岸，
    水势汪洋，一任鱼龙搅翻海底，
    风萧萧，雨凄凄，
    五谷不收，燕离巢，人无栖止。
    悲惨事，曷可纪？
    今大喜！人力回天地，
    河山一并治理。
    南北东西，全省流域尽规划，
    荆汉分洪早受益。
    拦河筑坝，修堤建闸，
    移山倒海，驱土运石，
    枢纽工程，还把水电站建立。
    防洪发电，灌溉运输，
    综合利用，且把千年忧患消除。
    丹江口，坝址方雄峙，
    三峡工程又计议，
    要百河听令，万水千山，悉听指使。
    千古英雄称大禹，
    “微禹，吾其鱼乎！”（注2）
    实则是，鬼斧神工，全依赖人民力。
    人民力，大于天，人民力，胜神鬼。
    看几年转变莫非人力，
    旧世界变新世界，个体变集体，
    八字宪法，大显威风，
    产生了多少奇迹，
    治水利，其一端耳。
    工矿农林牧副渔，
    人民公社齐并举，
    社会主义放光芒，烛照人间世。
    且看八方英雄聚会，竞逞豪气，
    生产大业，将都是，
    奇花异采，波谲云诡。
    注1，皆湖北省河流名。
    2，孔子赞禹治水之功绩，语见左传。
