People's Daily, Guangzhou, April 17th. The people's communes on Hainan Island are launching a large-scale production movement to cultivate oil crops, primarily tropical woody oil crops, striving to rapidly build Hainan Island into a national oil crop base.

Since the beginning of spring, over 120 people's communes across the island have planted over 234,000 mu of peanuts while fighting drought, essentially completing the original plan. Following the spring plowing and planting, the communes organized tropical crop professional teams, combined with mass short-term campaigns, to actively carry out land reclamation, pit digging, and planting work for the three major tropical woody oil crops: oil palm, coconut, and cashew. As of early April, land reclamation had reached 432,000 mu, and planting had been completed on over 48,000 mu. Among them, oil palm, which occupies the main position, has seen over 210,000 mu reclaimed, over 150,000 mu of pits dug, and over 38,000 mu planted. At the same time, the communes are strengthening the management of existing nurseries to accelerate seedling growth and supply the needs of the second large-scale planting after the summer harvest and planting, striving to complete the task of planting 1.65 million mu of the three major woody oil crops this year.

Oil palm, coconut, and cashew are all famous tropical woody oil crops with high economic value and suitable for large-scale development. The oil yield per unit area of ​​oil palm exceeds that of any other oil crop, generally being six to twelve times higher than that of peanuts and more than nine times higher than that of soybeans. It is known as the "King of Oil" in the world. Coconut oil yield is also three to four times higher than that of peanuts. These vegetable oils are not only excellent edible oils but also important industrial oils. After comprehensive utilization, these crops can yield many by-products for industrial raw materials. The coconut tree, for example, is known as a "treasure tree" with "no waste." Therefore, the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, has included the large-scale development of the three major woody oil crops as an important part of the plan to accelerate the development of tropical resources, and has actively strengthened the leadership of this work.

After the Qingming Festival, with continuous spring rains, various places seized the opportunity to carry out crash programs, with up to 60,000 commune members temporarily mobilized to participate in land reclamation, pit digging, and planting.

People's Daily, Yinchuan, April 17th. Counties in the Guyuan Prefecture in the southern mountainous area of ​​the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is rich in oil crops, have recently adopted many specific measures to vigorously change the low-yield state of oil crops.

This year, the counties in the Guyuan Prefecture plan to plant a total of 1.14 million mu of oil crops, mainly flax, an increase of 110,000 mu compared to last year, accounting for more than 80% of the oil crops in the entire autonomous region. According to the results of scientific experiments over the past few years and the rich cultivation experience of the local Hui and Han farmers, the Guyuan Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed eight major reforms in oil crop cultivation in February, namely: "Change from applying little fertilizer to applying more fertilizer, change from infrequent weeding to frequent weeding, change from inferior seeds to improved seeds, change from late planting to early planting, change from planting on stubble land to planting on superior land, change from extensive planting to careful cultivation, change from broadcasting to row planting, and change from sparse planting to dense planting." Based on this spirit and combined with the socialist and communist education movement, the people's communes in various counties launched discussions and debates among cadres and the masses on issues such as "Can oil production develop at high speed?", "Can oil crop production be rapidly improved?", and "Does planting oil crops reduce income?". Various places also conducted income accounting and recalled the abundant harvests in the area last year, so that the masses fully understood the favorable conditions and broad prospects for high-speed development of oil production, laying a solid ideological foundation for completely changing the low-yield state of oil crops.

During the recent sowing of oil crops, the people's communes in various counties improved the sowing quality of oil crops based on the different characteristics of different regions. In order to plant early and well, they advanced the sowing period by fifteen to twenty days, starting the flax sowing work before the Qingming Festival. As of April 8, the entire prefecture had sown more than 26,000 mu, including more than 6,000 mu of cadre experimental fields, high-yield demonstration fields, and large-area high-yield fields.

Excellent varieties are an important key to increasing yields. In order to increase yields, various places have expanded the planting area of ​​high-yielding and high-oil-content flax varieties, increasing the planting area of ​​improved varieties from 40% last year to more than 60%. Jingyuan County, which used to rely mainly on broadcasting, also implemented row planting on more than 60% of its land this year. In the sowing of oil crops, the people's communes in various counties also increased the amount of seeds per mu by about one jin compared to the past, ensuring reasonable dense planting of flax. Currently, the people's communes in the Guyuan Prefecture are vigorously organizing crash planting in order to complete the sowing of oil crops ahead of schedule in the shortest possible time.

    海南岛将建成木本油料基地
    今年计划开荒165万亩，大种油棕、椰子、腰果
    宁夏固原专区扩大胡麻面积革新栽培技术
    本报广州17日电　海南岛各地人民公社，正在展开一个以热带木本油料作物为主的大规模开荒种植油料作物的生产运动，力争高速度地把海南岛建成为国家油料作物基地。
    开春以来，全岛一百二十多个人民公社，已抗旱下种了花生二十三万四千多亩，基本完成了原订计划。在春耕春种以后，各公社又组织热带作物专业队伍，结合开展群众性的短期突击，积极进行油棕、椰子、腰果三大热带木本油料作物的开荒、挖穴和定植工作。至4月初，开荒已达四十三万二千亩，定植四万八千多亩。其中，占主要地位的油棕，已开荒二十一万多亩，完成挖穴十五万多亩，完成定植三万八千多亩。同时，各公社还加强现有苗圃的管理，以加速幼苗成长、供应夏收夏种后第二次大规模定植时的需要，力争完成今年种植三大木本油料作物一百六十五万亩的任务。
    油棕、椰子、腰果都是经济价值很高、适合大量发展的著名热带木本油料作物。油棕的单位面积产油量超过任何油料作物，一般比花生高六到十二倍，比大豆高九倍以上，向有“世界油王”称号。椰子出油也比花生高三、四倍。这几种植物油不但是优良的食用油，还是重要的工业用油。这些作物经过综合利用，可得到许多作工业原料的副产品。像椰子树就被称为“一身无废物”的“宝树”。因此，中共海南区党委根据中央和广东省委的指示，在制定加速开发热带资源的规划中，把大规模发展三大木本油料作物作为重要的部分，并积极加强了这一工作的领导。
    清明节后，绵绵春雨，各地即抓紧时机突击，临时发动社员参加开荒、挖穴、定植的社员一度达到六万多人。
    本报银川17日电　宁夏回族自治区南部山区盛产油料的固原专区各县，最近采取了许多具体措施，大力改变油料作物的低产面貌。
    今年固原专区各县，计划种植的以胡麻为主的油料作物共有一百一十四万亩，比去年扩大了十一万亩，占全自治区油料作物的80％以上。中共固原地委根据几年来的科学试验结果，和当地回汉族农民的丰富栽培经验，在2月间就提出种植油料作物的八大改革，即：“改少施肥为多施肥，改少锄草为勤锄草，改劣种为良种，改晚种为早种，改下茬地为上茬地，改粗种为细耕，改撒播为条播，改稀植为密植”。各县人民公社根据这一精神，并结合社会主义、共产主义教育运动，在广大干部和群众中开展了“油料生产究竟能不能高速度发展”、
  “油料作物生产究竟能不能迅速提高”和“种油料是不是减少收入”等问题的鸣放辩论，各地还通过算收入账和回忆去年当地的丰产事实，使群众充分认识了高速度发展油料生产的有利条件和广阔的前景，为彻底改变油料低产面貌，打好巩固的思想基础。
    各县人民公社在最近播种油料作物中，都根据不同地区的不同特点，改进了油料作物的播种质量。为了种得早种得好，他们把播种期提前十五到二十天，在清明节前就开始了胡麻的播种工作。截至4月8日，全专区已播种二万六千多亩，其中有干部试验田、高额丰产田、大面积丰产田六千多亩。
    优良品种是提高产量的重要关键。为了提高产量，各地都扩大了产量高、含油量大的优良胡麻品种，使优良品种的种植面积由去年的40％扩大到60％以上。过去以撒播为主的泾源县，今年也有60％以上实行了条播。各县人民公社在播种油料作物中，在下种量方面每亩地也比过去提高了一斤左右，保证了胡麻的合理密植。现在，固原专区各人民公社为了争取在最短的时间内提前播完油料作物，正在大力组织抢种。（附图片）
