    After Watching the Documentary "Ordinary People"
    Projectionist Qiu Jingkuan
    "Ordinary People" is a short documentary that only lasts eight or nine minutes, but it is a moving and excellent film. I say it's good because it gave me a profound education, and because it makes me love my work and my country even more.
    When we see the comrades who are the time announcers of the 07 station of the Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau, working day and night in front of the time announcement station, when we hear that they announce the time 360 times every hour, and have made no mistakes in more than 760,000 times, who doesn't appreciate the hard work they put into their work? Who doesn't feel that they are truly the "masters of time"? When we see Dr. Li Songlin carefully and patiently taking care of pregnant women and delivering babies, when we hear that she has personally welcomed the birth of more than 8,000 new lives, when we see the "children" she delivered studying at universities and operating at workbenches, who doesn't appreciate the efforts she has made for the people, and who doesn't feel respect from the bottom of their hearts for this "great mother"? When we see Comrade Chen Zhiyuan carefully ironing clothes, see the five irons with worn-through soles, and see the customer's happy smile, who can't feel that he is bringing joy and happiness to people?
    The film "Ordinary People" allows us to recognize the great significance of ordinary labor. Ordinary labor is like frame after frame of a film, ordinary labor is like brick after brick building a mansion. They are organized together for a common purpose—building socialism. It then produces the enormous power to move mountains and fill seas, create the world, and drive history forward. All miracles will only appear in the hands of ordinary working people. Moreover, it allows us to see how much importance and respect ordinary laborers receive in socialist countries. Look at the medal on Dr. Li's chest, look at the pig-raising girl who came to the Great Hall of the People, look at the salt workers who were sent to Beidaihe by the government for recuperation... The trust and respect of the Party and the people for them is the greatest reward and honor for them.
    Perhaps because of my profession, when I saw projectionists and film delivery personnel also appearing on the screen, an irrepressible surge of heat gushed from the bottom of my heart like a fountain. In the past, some people called us "movie players," saying that we would be useless for a lifetime of moving switches, but today we are also on the screen. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "Labor is the foundation on which human society survives and develops, and laborers are the creators of civilization. Therefore, labor should become the most respected thing in the world, and laborers should become the most respected people." Today, all of this has been realized in our socialist motherland.
    Comrades in all ordinary jobs: work harder! Dedicate our life's energy. The labor position we are engaged in is a screw on the socialist-communist train of the motherland's leap forward. Let us push the motherland's train to accelerate and leap forward with our diligent and unremitting efforts!

    纪录片“平凡的人”观后
    放映员　丘静宽
    “平凡的人”是一部只放映八九分钟的短纪录片，却是一部激动人心的好片子。我说它好，是因为它给了我深刻的教育，是因为它使我更爱我的事业，更爱我的祖国。
    当我们从影片中看到北京市内电话局零七台的报时员同志，不分昼夜工作在报时台前的时候，当听说她们每小时报时三百六十次，七十六万多次没出差错的时候，谁不体会到他们工作中所作的艰苦努力呢？谁不觉得她们才真正是“时间的主人”呢？当我们从影片中看到李松林大夫细心耐心地照料产妇、接生婴儿的时候，当听说她亲手迎接了八千多新生命的降生的时候，当看到经她接生的“孩子”在大学读书、在工具台前操作的时候，谁不体会到她为人民付出的心血，谁不从心底里对这“伟大的母亲”表示崇敬呢？当我们看到陈智远同志在认真地熨烫衣服，看到那五架磨穿底的烙铁，看到顾客欣然一笑的时候，谁能不感到他是在给人们带来愉快和欢乐呢？
    影片“平凡的人”让我们认识到平凡劳动的伟大意义，平凡的劳动就像一格一格画面组成影片一样，平凡的劳动就像一块一块砖瓦盖成大厦一样，它们组织在一起，为了一个共同的目的——建设社会主义，它就产生了移山填海创造世界、推动历史前进的巨大力量。一切奇迹只会在平凡的劳动人民的手中出现。而且让我们看到了在社会主义国家、普通劳动者多么受人重视与尊敬。你看李大夫胸前的奖章，你看养猪姑娘来到了人民大会堂，你看洗盐工被政府送到北戴河去休养……党和人民对他们的信任与尊敬，是对他们最大的奖赏和荣誉。
    也许因为同行的缘故，当我看到放映员、跑片员也出现在银幕上的时候，一股无法抑制的热流像喷泉一样从我心底里涌上来，涌上来。过去，有人叫我们“耍电影的”，说我们搬一辈子开关没出息，可是今天也上了银幕。刘少奇同志说过：“劳动乃是人类社会赖以生存和发展的基础，劳动者乃是文明的创造者。因此，劳动应该成为世界上最受尊敬的事情，劳动者应该成为世界上最受尊敬的人们”。今天这一切在我们社会主义的祖国已经实现了。
    一切平凡工作岗位上的同志们：加倍努力吧！献出我们毕生的精力。我们从事的劳动岗位，是祖国飞跃前进的社会主义——共产主义列车上的一颗螺丝钉，让我们以辛勤的不懈的努力推动着祖国列车加速飞跃前进吧！
