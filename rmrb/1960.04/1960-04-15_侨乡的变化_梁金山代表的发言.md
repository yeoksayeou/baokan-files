Changes in the Overseas Chinese Hometown
Speech by Delegate Liang Jinshan
	I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee.
	I am an overseas Chinese who returned from abroad. In recent years, seeing the prosperous scene of the motherland's construction, I feel infinitely excited.
	The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture has more than 1,100 households of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, totaling nearly 40,000 people. Before liberation, they, like other people, lived in extreme poverty. A year of hard work could only solve the food rations for two or three months. Some even had no food to eat after the autumn harvest. Of course, there was no culture to speak of. Overseas Chinese relatives had to travel several miles to find someone to write a letter to their relatives abroad.
	After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the production in the overseas Chinese hometown has developed at a high speed, and the lives of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese have gradually improved. The face of the overseas Chinese hometown has been completely renewed.

	Grain Production Continues to Grow
	In Heshun Township, Tengchong, the total grain output in 1949 when it was liberated was only 400,000 jin, with an average of less than three months of rations per person. After the land reform in 1953, the total grain output reached 1.3 million jin. Later, with the realization of cooperativization and communization, grain growth was particularly rapid. Especially in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, grain increased by 21% on the basis of 1957, reaching 2.9 million jin, with an average of 685 jin of grain per person. In 1959, there was a huge increase on the basis of 1958, averaging more than 800 jin per person. Compared with before liberation, it has increased more than nine times. In Baitamenagement area or production team, Longling County, the total grain output in 1952 was only more than 250,000 jin, with an average of only 350 jin of grain per person. By 1958, the output reached 460,000 jin, an increase of more than 80%. The average was 618 jin of grain per person. The increase was even more prominent in 1959, reaching 800 jin per person. Due to the rapid development of production, overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese got rid of the small pockets they used to buy rice for generations and changed from grain-deficient households to surplus grain households. Before liberation, Liu Yueqin, a relative of an overseas Chinese, had a very difficult life. After cooperativization, she joined the cooperative. After the establishment of the people's commune, she joined the commune. She could not finish eating the millet she received each year and also received some wheat and beans. Life has been greatly improved. She said: If it weren't for the leadership of the Party, we wouldn't have such a good life today.
	In the old society, basic water conservancy construction was not valued at all. The ruling class took the opportunity to build water conservancy and extorted a lot of blood and sweat from the peasants. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Heshun Township, Tengchong, built two large ditches, east and west, surrounding the entire village and dam, stretching for more than ten kilometers, changing the river course of the Jiuwanshibatuan Da Yingjiang River. The fertile land of the entire dam will never be threatened by floods and droughts. The overseas Chinese area of Longling County has also built two reservoirs (Yiqun Reservoir and Xialong Reservoir) that can irrigate 4,000 mu of newly reclaimed fields and 245 mu of water-deficient fields. A 60-kilometer-long Huangda Ditch was built, turning 245 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Therefore, a bumper harvest of agricultural production is greatly guaranteed. It is particularly worth mentioning that the women of Baitamenagement area, Longshan Commune, built a "Women's Ditch". This ditch had been clamored for many years in the old society, but it was not completed. However, during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the women of the entire village gave full play to their soaring enthusiasm and completed it in more than a month with the help of only a few male workers. The benefited fields increased grain production by 40%. Due to the rapid development of basic water conservancy construction, shortly after the rice was harvested on most of the fields, the fields were filled with lush wheat and beans, changing the situation where only one crop of rice could be planted a year. Heshun Township, Tengchong, started planting wheat in 1956 and harvested more than 30,000 jin. In 1957, the income was more than 210,000 jin, an increase of more than six times compared with 1956. In 1959, wheat and beans were basically planted everywhere. This year, a bumper harvest of wheat is expected.

		Overseas Chinese Hometown Has Commune-Run Industry
	While agriculture is developing, overseas Chinese hometown has also established industry for the first time. Longshan Commune in Longling County established an agricultural tool factory that can manufacture agricultural production tools such as threshers and seeders. Heshun Township, Tengchong, also established an agricultural tool factory and built two hydropower stations with a power generation capacity of 30 kilowatts and 120 kilowatts, using electricity to drive threshers and rope-traction machines to plow fields. Agricultural production has taken a step towards mechanization.
	A characteristic of the overseas Chinese hometown is that there are many women. In the old society, let alone women participating in labor, some rarely even went out of the house. They just did housework and took care of their children. The establishment of the people's commune has opened up broad avenues for liberating women's labor force. While leading overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese to actively engage in agricultural production, the Party and the government have extensively developed diversified operations and various sideline productions. At present, Heshun Township People's Commune in Tengchong County has organized sideline productions such as sewing, shoemaking, bamboo ware, weaving, rice milling, food, pig raising, chicken raising, duck raising, and goose raising. More than 180 weak relatives of overseas Chinese have played a positive role. The establishment of public canteens has further liberated women's labor force. Women also participate in labor like men. With the increase in income, life has been further improved. Ma Jiteng, a relative of an overseas Chinese in Xishan Village, Baoshan County, has three laborers (two women). In 1957, there were only 4,726 work points. After the canteen was established, the work points obtained each year increased to more than 8,000 due to the participation of women in labor.

	Cultural and Educational Undertakings Have Also Developed Greatly
	While developing production, the Party is very concerned about the cultural education and welfare undertakings of the overseas Chinese hometown. In recent years, the cultural, educational, and social welfare undertakings in the overseas Chinese hometown have greatly developed. For example, Yiqun Middle School in Heshun Township, Tengchong, has developed from three classes with 107 students in 1949 to 16 classes with 755 students. Compared with the past, the number of classes has increased five times, and the number of people has increased seven times. Before liberation, there was only junior high school, but now there is high school. The development of primary schools is also very rapid. Before liberation, there were only more than 500 primary school students, but now it has developed to more than 870 students. Not only have regular schools increased, but the development of spare-time schools is also very large. For example, six literacy classes have been set up, and more than 400 people have removed the illiteracy label after studying. The number of students in Baitamenagement area or production team, Longling County, has grown even faster. Before liberation, there were only 30 primary school students in the entire village, but in 1959, it has developed to 150, an increase of five times.
	In short, in recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the overseas Chinese hometown is undergoing earth-shaking changes. Under the education of the Party, the patriotic awareness and enthusiasm of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese for building socialism have also been greatly improved. The ideological outlook of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese has undergone great changes. People help and care for each other, couples are harmonious, neighbors are friendly, cooperation is in vogue, and selfless dedication is emerging in an endless stream. Many people have been rated as advanced producers and advanced workers. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant light of the general line, everyone was full of energy and created many miracles. Heshun Township in Tengchong saw the emergence of 210 advanced producers, some of whom were commended or rewarded by the Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. In Xishan Village, Baoshan, out of more than 60 people in the entire village, 47 have become advanced producers of the commune and production team, and they have become role models for overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese to learn from.
	The changes that have taken place in the overseas Chinese hometown in recent years under the correct leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao fully prove the power of the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune. We believe that in the continued Great Leap Forward, the overseas Chinese hometown in Yunnan will achieve greater success. (Attached picture)

### 侨乡的变化  梁金山代表的发言

    侨乡的变化
    梁金山代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和常务委员会的工作报告。
    我是一个从海外归国的华侨，几年来，看到祖国的建设的繁荣景象，我感到无限的兴奋。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州共有侨眷、归侨一千一百多户，将近四万人。解放以前，他们也与其他人民一样，过着极端贫困的生活，一年辛勤劳动，仅能解决两三个月的口粮，有的甚至秋收之后就没有粮食吃了。当然更谈不上有什么文化，侨眷要给国外亲人写封信，也得跑上几里路，才能找到一个写信的人。
    解放以后，侨乡的人民，在党的领导下，侨乡的生产，有了高速度的发展，侨眷、归侨的生活也逐步的得到提高，侨乡的面貌已是焕然一新。
    粮食产量不断增长
    腾冲和顺乡，1949年解放时，粮食总产量只是四十万斤，每人平均不到三个月的口粮。1953年土改以后，粮食总产量达到一百三十万斤。以后随着合作化、公社化的实现，粮食增长特别快。尤其是1958年大跃进的一年，粮食在1957年的基础上增长了21％，达到二百九十万斤，每人平均有粮食六百八十五斤。1959年在1958年的基础上又有了巨大的增长，平均每人达到八百多斤。与解放前比较增加了九倍还多。龙陵县白塔管理区或生产队，1952年粮食总产量仅二十五万多斤，平均每人只有粮食三百五十斤，到1958年产量达到四十六万斤，增长了80％以上。每人平均有粮食六百一十八斤。1959年增长更为突出，每人达到八百斤。由于生产的飞速发展，侨眷、归侨甩掉了祖祖辈辈用来买米的小口袋，由缺粮户变为余粮户。侨眷刘月芹解放前生活十分困难，合作化后，参加了合作社，成立了人民公社，她又参加了公社，她每年分得的谷子吃不完，并分到一些小麦，豆类。生活大大改善。她说：要不是党的领导，不会有今天这样好的日子。
    水利基本建设，在旧社会里是根本不被人重视的，统治阶级反以兴修水利为名，大量索取农民的血汗。解放后，在党的领导下，腾冲和顺乡修了围绕整个村庄和坝子的长达十几公里的东、西两条大沟，改变了九弯十八转大盈江的河道。使整个坝子的良田永远不再会受到洪灾和旱灾的威胁。龙陵县侨区也修了两个水库（益群水库和下龙水库）能够灌溉四千亩新开田和缺水田二百四十五亩。修了一条长达六十公里的黄大沟，使二百四十五亩旱田变成水田。因此大大保证了农业生产的丰收。特别值得提出的是龙山公社白塔管理区的妇女们，修了一条“妇女大沟”。这条沟在旧社会里叫嚷了多少年，没有修成。但是在1958年大跃进中，全村妇女发挥了冲天的干劲，经过一月多的时间，仅有几个男工的帮助就修成了。受益的田，增产了粮食40％。由于水利基本建设的迅速发展，绝大多数的田地上稻谷收割不久，满田满地又长满了绿油油的小麦、豆类，改变了一年只能种一季稻谷的情况。腾冲和顺乡，1956年开始种麦子，就收了三万多斤，1957年收入二十一万多斤，比1956年增长了六倍多，1959年基本上满地种上了麦子豆类。今年小麦丰收又大有希望。
          侨乡有了社办工业
    在农业发展的同时，侨乡也破天荒地办起了工业。龙陵县龙山公社创办了农具厂，能制造打谷机、播种机等农业生产工具。腾冲和顺乡也办了农具厂，建立了发电能力三十瓩和一百二十瓩的水力发电站两个，用电力带动脱粒机和绳索牵引机犁田。农业生产已向机械化的道路迈上了一步。
    侨乡的特点是妇女多。在旧社会里，莫说妇女参加劳动，有的甚至连大门都很少出，她们就是做做家务，领领孩子。人民公社的成立，给解放妇女劳动力开辟了广阔的道路。党和政府在领导侨眷归侨积极从事农业生产的同时，广泛的开展了多种经营和各种副业生产。目前腾冲县和顺乡人民公社已组织了缝纫、制鞋、竹器、织布、碾米、食品、养猪、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅等副业生产。使一百八十多个劳动力弱的侨眷发挥了积极作用。公共食堂的成立，又进一步解放了妇女劳动力，妇女也和男子一样参加了劳动，随着收入的增加，生活又更进一步得到改善。保山县西山村侨脊马技腾家有三个劳动力（妇女二人），1957年只有四千七百二十六个工分，办了食堂以后，由于妇女参加了劳动，每年得的工分增加到八千多。
      文化教育事业也有很大发展
    在发展生产的同时，党十分关怀侨乡的文化教育、福利事业。几年来，侨乡的文教、社会福利事业有了很大的发展。如腾冲和顺乡的益群中学已从1949年的三个班一百零七人，发展到十六个班，七百五十五人。与过去相比，班次增加了五倍，人数增加了七倍，解放前只有初中，现在有了高中。小学的发展也十分迅速，解放前只有小学生五百多人，现在已发展到八百七十多人。不仅正规学校增加，业余学校发展也很大。如办了识字班六班，经过学习已有四百多人摘掉了文盲帽子。龙陵县白塔管理区或生产队学生增长更快。解放前全村仅有小学生三十个，1959年已发展到一百五十个，增长了五倍。
    总之，几年来，在党的领导下，侨乡正在发生着翻天复地的变化。在党的教育下，侨眷和归侨的爱国主义觉悟和建设社会主义的积极性也大大的提高，侨眷和归侨的思想面貌有了很大的变化，人与人互相帮助，互相爱护，夫妻和顺，邻里相亲，协作成风，舍己为人，大公无私的事迹层出不穷，不少人被评为先进生产者和先进工作者。特别是1958年大跃进中，在总路线的光辉照耀下，人人干劲冲天，创造了不少奇迹。腾冲和顺乡就出现二百一十个先进生产者，有的受到省侨务处和中侨委的表扬或奖励。保山西山村全村只有六十多人就有四十七人成为公社、生产队的先进生产者，他们已成为侨眷归侨学习的榜样。
    几年来侨乡人民在伟大的共产党和毛主席的正确领导之下所起的变化，是完全证明了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的威力，我们相信，在继续的大跃进中，云南的侨乡将会取得更大的成绩。（附图片）
