Comrade Representatives:

    I fully endorse and agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and all other reports of the conference. I will now give the conference a brief report on the situation of hog production development in Hunan. Any inappropriate points, please correct me.

    Vigorously developing hog production is an important task in current agricultural production and a crucial step in promoting the overall development of agriculture.

    In 1959, my province saw significant development in hog production, with the number of hogs raised reaching 20.3 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to 1958. Among them, the number of hogs in stock at the end of the year increased by 9.5%. Before liberation, the hog-raising industry in my province was underdeveloped. In 1949, there was only one hog for every ten people on average. Even in the "golden" era before the War of Resistance Against Japan—1936—there was only one hog for every seven people on average. In 1959, my province had already reached an average of more than one hog for every two people. The province also has Xinhuang and Changsha counties, thirty-four communes, two thousand six hundred production brigades, and twelve thousand production teams that have achieved one hog per mu of cultivated land. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party last year, especially after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the instructions in October that "the hog is the head of the six domestic animals," "greatly and specially raise hogs," and "attach equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry," the province held a hog-raising conference. Counties, communes, brigades, production teams, and work groups all held conferences. After extensive publicity and mobilization and the adoption of a series of specific measures, the province quickly launched a high tide of hog raising. The number of hogs in stock in January this year increased by 140,000 compared to the end of last year, and in February, it increased by another 170,000 compared to January. The state purchased 9.6% more fattened hogs in January and February this year than in the same period last year, breaking the "conventional" decline in the total number of hogs raised in January and February of previous years due to the large amount of slaughtering as urban and rural people celebrated the Spring Festival. Great achievements have been made in sow breeding, pig farm construction, hog disease prevention, and the reform of feeding tools.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "Putting animal husbandry on an equal footing with crop cultivation, and putting hog raising in the primary position in animal husbandry, is an important step in promoting the overall development of agriculture. One hog is a small organic fertilizer factory. Grasping the hog-raising issue means grasping the key to increasing fertilizer production quickly, well, and economically. When hogs increase in large numbers and animal husbandry develops greatly, the supply of meat will be solved, and the sources of raw materials for light industry will be expanded." Therefore, in 1960, my province plans to vigorously develop hog production, aiming to double the number of hogs raised compared to last year, striving to reach 40 million, with 32 million in stock at the end of the year, achieving one hog per person. To achieve this goal, we are working hard to do the following:

    First, vigorously publicize and implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on "attaching equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry" and "putting animal husbandry on an equal footing with crop cultivation." Experience has proven that once this wise instruction of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is grasped by the broad masses, it transforms into a great material force. Where the publicity is thorough, hog development is fast; where the publicity is insufficient, hog development is slow. Therefore, we are continuing to widely and deeply publicize to the masses, so that the broad masses understand the interdependence between hog raising and the development of other livestock and grain production, and the interdependence between crop cultivation and animal husbandry. They consciously take the path of attaching equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry and develop hog production at high speed.

    Second, adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs" to accelerate the speed of hog development. The experience of the past year and more has proven that the great development of the hog-raising industry must rely primarily on the collective, and collective hog raising has great advantages. However, private raising is also an aspect that cannot be ignored at present. Judging from the situation in the second half of last year, it is possible for the province's eight million farm households to raise two to three million hogs. Therefore, we adhere to the policy of collective breeding as the main focus, with both public and private breeding being carried out simultaneously. In terms of collective hog raising, we adhere to the principle of large collectives as the main focus, with large and small collectives being carried out simultaneously, launching the "ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand" movement of "ten hogs raised in dining halls, one hundred hogs raised by production teams, one thousand hogs raised by production brigades, and ten thousand hogs raised by communes." At present, while developing hog raising by communes, brigades, and production teams, we attach great importance to hog raising in dining halls. Because there are more than 410,000 dining halls in the province, if each dining hall raises more than ten hogs, the province can raise five to six million hogs, and hog raising in dining halls has many conveniences. In addition, we adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs" in pig farm construction, hog disease prevention, and tool reform, in order to mobilize all positive factors in hog raising and accelerate the speed of hog development.

    Third, in terms of specific measures for developing hog raising, we adhere to "five specialties" and vigorously promote "five savings."

    Adhere to the "five specialties," which are: (1) Specialized leadership: Party committees at all levels have dedicated personnel in charge, with secretaries or members specifically responsible for hog production. At present, 52% of the counties and cities, 93% of the communes, and 72% of the brigades in my province have equipped dedicated secretaries, and the rest have dedicated members. (2) Specialized organizations: There should be a set of specialized organizations in charge of livestock production from top to bottom, with a team of professional cadres. Now, specialized organizations at all levels in my province have been initially established, and there are more than 4,800 professional cadres at all levels. (3) There are a total of 1.03 million professional feeders and disease prevention personnel, a large proportion of whom are female laborers. Many places have also promoted the "one-family class" (i.e., the whole family) hog-raising method. In this way, labor allocation, income distribution, and other issues can be better resolved. This is a good method. (4) Dedicated green fodder land. There are many sources of green fodder, such as collecting wild fodder, processing agricultural and sideline products, and utilizing vacant courtyards and winter fallow land. However, the basic requirement is to have a certain amount of dedicated green fodder land; otherwise, it will be difficult to guarantee the supply of fodder. At present, my province has approximately six million mu of dedicated green fodder land, of which four million mu are using newly reclaimed wasteland and water surfaces. (5) Dedicated feed grain. Adhere to the principle of overall planning for food grain and feed grain. Under the current situation where grain is not very abundant, we must have the determination in this regard. From 1959 to 1960, in accordance with this spirit, the production brigades of the people's communes in the province arranged a total of 1.5 billion jin of feed grain.

    Vigorously grasp the "five savings," which means vigorously grasping savings in five aspects. First, grasp labor saving, and make every effort to save hog-raising labor, so as to use less people to raise more hogs. The key to saving labor lies in vigorously carrying out tool reform, technological innovation, and technological revolution. According to statistics, there are currently more than 67,000 pig farms in my province that have achieved mechanized material cutting, automated water supply, and manure transportation, with more than half of the feeding labor saved in these pig farms, and the work efficiency of many pig farms has increased several times. After 70% of the pig farms in the Guoqing People's Commune in Yiyang County used advanced tools, the number of feeders was reduced by 320 compared to the original, while the number of hogs raised increased by more than 7,000. Second, grasp land saving, so as to occupy less land, especially less good cultivated land, not compete with grain for land, and produce more fodder. Our approach is to build pigsties as much as possible on small hills and hills, occupying little or no existing cultivated land; concentrate appropriately on specialized operation in fodder planting to strive for high yields; and advance into the water surface, making full use of water pits, ponds, small pools, and reservoirs in front of and behind houses to widely plant aquatic fodder. Third, grasp fuel saving, so as to save fuel and raise hogs well. With more hogs raised, boiling swill and burning firewood is a major event. According to our estimates, an average hog burns two jin of coal a day, which is 720 jin a year. Burning firewood requires even more, six jin a day, which is 21 dan a year. Requiring so much fuel not only has problems with sources, but the labor problem of cutting, digging, and transporting is even greater. Therefore, saving fuel is a major event. Our main method is to vigorously promote silage, saccharification, and fermentation fodder to gradually change the historical habit of boiling swill. According to typical experiments, promoting the above fodder preparation methods can save 70% to 80% of fuel, while also saving 20% to 30% of labor. Fourth, grasp the saving of building materials. For newly built pigsties, we adhere to the principle of making do with whatever is available, making extensive use of old pigsties and vacant houses, which are renovated or expanded. Fifth, grasp saving breeding hogs. Our method is to "keep every sow, choose later." At present, there are a total of 4.5 million adult sows and reserve sows in the province, which can basically guarantee the need for hog sources this year. We have now begun to pay attention to the selection of fine breeds and breed improvement, continuously improving the quality of hogs, and vigorously promoting artificial insemination, double mating, and strengthening the feeding management of sows and piglets, continuously improving the sow farrowing rate and the survival rate of piglets, and saving the amount of feed for breeding hogs.

    Fourth, vigorously improve the management of collective hog raising and run pig farms well. At present, 88,000 new pig farms have been built in my province. Together with the renovated and existing ones, there are a total of 200,000 pig farms of various sizes. Running these pig farms well has become an important key to ensuring the completion of this year's hog-raising task. In addition to establishing a fodder base, we also attach great importance to the disease prevention of hogs. In 1959, the province basically eliminated and controlled the epidemic of hog cholera, swine erysipelas, and swine plague. This year, we have decided to fully mobilize the masses on the basis of this victory and adopt both indigenous and foreign methods to do a good job in the prevention and treatment of hog asthma and piglet white diarrhea. In addition, we also pay attention to further establishing and improving various responsibility systems of pig farms, strengthening labor management, and running pig farms better.

    At present, the hog-raising industry in my province, like various construction undertakings, has a very good situation. The relationship between more hogs – more fertilizer – more grain and the mutual dependence and mutual promotion of animal husbandry and crop cultivation has become increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses for developing hog raising is unprecedentedly high. As long as we continue to adhere to putting politics in command, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and launching mass movements, we will be fully capable of completing and overfulfilling this year's hog-raising plan, and with hogs as the head and equal importance to hogs and cattle, achieve a comprehensive leap forward in animal husbandry.

### 调动一切积极因素加快发展生猪生产  易湘苏代表的发言

    调动一切积极因素加快发展生猪生产
    易湘苏代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护和同意李富春副总理的报告、李先念副总理的报告，以及大会的其他各项报告。我现在就湖南发展生猪生产的情况，向大会作一简要汇报。不妥之处，请予指正。 　 大力发展生猪生产，是当前农业生产上的一项重要任务，是促进农业全面发展的重要步骤。 　 我省1959年生猪生产有了较大的发展，全省养猪达两千零三十万头，比1958年增长8.2％，其中年底存栏头数增长9.5％。解放前，我省的养猪事业是不发达的。1949年平均每十个人才有一头猪，就是在抗战前的“黄金”时代——1936年，也只平均每七个人才有一头猪。1959年，我省就已达到平均每两个人有一头多猪了。全省还有新晃、长沙两个县，三十四个公社，二千六百个生产大队，一万二千个生产队，达到了一亩耕地一头猪。自去年党的八届八中全会以来，特别是党中央和毛主席在10月间发出“猪为六畜之首”，“大养特养其猪”，“种植业与畜牧业并重”的指示以后，省里开了养猪大会，县、公社、大
  队、生产队和作业组都开了大会，经过广泛宣传动员，采取了一系列具体措施，全省很快掀起了养猪高潮。今年1月份生猪存栏数比去年年底增加十四万头，2月份又比1月份增加十七万头。今年1、2月份国家收购的肥猪，比去年同期增加9.6％，打破了历年1、2月份因城乡人民欢度春节，屠宰量大，养猪总头数下降
  的“常规”。母猪配种，猪场建设，猪疫防治以及饲养工具改革，都获得了很大的成绩。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，而在畜牧业中又把养猪放在首要地位，这是促进农业全面发展的重要步骤。一头猪就是一个小型有机化肥工厂。抓住了养猪问题，就抓住了多快好省地增产肥料的关键。猪大量地增加起来，畜牧业大量发展起来，也就解决了肉食供应，并且扩大了轻工业的原料来源。”因此，1960年，我省计划大力发展生猪生产，养猪头数要比去年翻一番，力争发展到四千万头，年底存栏三千二百万头，实现一人一头猪。为了达到这个目标，我们正在抓紧做好以下几方面的工作：
    第一、大力宣传贯彻执行党中央和毛主席关于“种植业与畜牧业并重”，“把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位”的指示。经验证明，党中央和毛主席这一英明指示，一旦为广大群众所掌握，就变成伟大的物质力量。那里宣传得深透，那里生猪发展就快，那里宣传得不够，那里生猪发展就慢。因此，我们正在继续广泛深入地向群众进行宣传，使广大群众懂得养猪及发展其他家畜与增产粮食的相互依存的关系，种植业与畜牧业相互依存的关系，自觉地走种植业与畜牧业并重的道路，高速度地发展生猪生产。
    第二、坚持两条腿走路的方针，加快生猪发展速度。过去一年多的经验证明，养猪事业的大发展，必须依靠集体为主，集体养猪优越性大。但目前私养也是不可忽视的一个方面，全省八百万农户，从去年下半年情况看，养二百万到三百万头猪是可能的。因此，我们养猪坚持集体饲养为主，公养和私养并举的方针。在集体养猪方面，我们则坚持以大集体为主，大集体和小集体并举，开展食堂养十头，生产队养百头，生产大队养千头，公社养万头的“十、百、千、万”运动。目前我们在发展公社、大队和生产队养猪的同时，十分重视食堂养猪。因为全省四十一万多个食堂，每个食堂养十多头猪，全省就可以养五百万至六百万头，而且食堂养猪有很多方便。此外，在猪场的建设、猪疫防治以及工具改革等方面，我们都坚持两条腿走路的方针，以调动一切养猪的积极因素，加快生猪的发展速度。
    第三、在发展养猪具体措施上，我们是坚持“五专”，大搞“五省”。
    坚持“五专”，就是：（一）专职领导，各级党委有专人负责，有专管生猪生产的书记或委员。目前我省已有52％的县、市，93％的公社，72％的大队，配备了专职书记，其余的都有了专职的委员。（二）专业机构，从上到下要有一套专管畜牧生产的机构，一班子专业干部。现在我省各级专业机构已初步建立起来，各级专业干部已有四千八百余人。（三）专业的饲养员和防疫员共有一百零三万人，很大一部分是妇女劳动力。不少地方还推广了“一家班”（即全家）的养猪办法，这样，劳力的搭配、收入分配等问题都能较好地解决，这是一个好方法。（四）专用青饲料地。青饲料的来源很多，采集野生饲料，加工农副产品，利用空坪隙地、冬闲田，但基本的还是要有一定的专用青饲料地，否则就很难保证饲料的供应。目前我省专用青饲料地约有六百万亩，其中有四百万亩是利用新开的荒地和水面。（五）专用饲料粮。坚持口粮与饲料粮统筹安排的原则，在目前粮食还不很富裕的情况下，在这方面要有决心。1959年至1960年度，我们按照这个精神，全省人民公社的生产大队共安排了十五亿斤饲料粮。
    大抓“五省”，就是大抓五个方面的节约。一是抓省工，千方百计地节约养猪劳动力，做到少用人，多养猪。省工的关键在于大搞工具改革，大搞技术革新和技术革命。据统计，目前我省实现切料机械化，用水自流化和运潲车子化的猪场，已有六万七千多个，这些猪场饲养用工都节省一半以上，不少猪场工效成倍地提高。益阳县国庆人民公社70％的猪场使用先进工具后，在养猪增加七千多头的情况下，饲养员比原来减少了三百二十个。二是抓省地，做到少占地，特别是少占好耕地，不与粮争田，多产饲料。我们的作法是猪栏尽量建在小山丘陵上，不占或少占现有耕地；在饲料种植上适当集中连片，专业经营，争取高产；向水面进军，充分利用屋前屋后水坑、凼、小池和库坝堰塘，广种水生饲料。三是抓节省燃料，做到省燃料，养好猪。猪养多了，煮潲烧柴是件大事，据我们估算，平均一头猪一天烧二斤煤，一年就是七百二十斤。烧柴就要得更多了，一天六斤，一年就是二十一担。要这样多燃料，不仅来源有问题，砍挖、运输的劳力问题更大，因此节省燃料是件大事。我们采取的主要办法是大力推广青贮、醣化、发酵饲料，逐步改变煮潲的历史习惯。据典型试验，推行上述饲料调制方法，可以节省燃料70％至80％，同时还可节省劳力百分二十至三十。四是抓节省建筑材料。新建猪栏我们坚持因陋就简的原则，大量利用旧有猪栏，空闲房屋，加以改修或扩建。五是抓省种猪。我们的办法是“见母就留，先留后选”。目前全省的成年母猪和后备母猪共有四百五十万头，可以基本保证今年猪源的需要。现在已开始注意了良种选择和品种改良，不断地提高猪的质量，并且大力推行了人工授精，双配复配，加强母猪仔猪的饲养管理，不断提高母猪产仔率和仔猪的成活率，节省种猪饲养量。
    第四、大力搞好集体养猪的经营管理，办好养猪场。目前我省已新建猪场八万八千个，加上改建的和原有的，大小猪场共有二十万个。办好这些猪场，已经成为保证完成今年养猪任务的重要关键。办好养猪场，除了建立饲料基地以外，我们还十分重视生猪的防疫工作。1959年全省已经基本上消灭和控制了猪瘟、猪丹毒和猪肺疫的流行。今年我们决定在这一胜利的基础上，充分发动群众，采取土洋并举的办法，做好猪喘气病和仔猪白痢病的防治工作。此外，还注意进一步建立和健全养猪场的各种责任制度，加强劳动管理，把养猪场办得更好。
    目前我省的养猪事业，和各项建设事业一样，形势是非常好的。猪多——肥多——粮多和畜牧业与种植业的相互依存、相互促进的关系，已经越来越深入人心，广大群众对发展养猪的积极性空前高涨，只要我们继续坚持政治挂帅，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，大搞群众运动，完成和超额完成今年的养猪计划，并且以猪为首，猪、牛并重，实现畜牧业的全面大跃进，是完全能够办到的。
