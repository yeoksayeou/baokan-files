    Long Live Revolutionary Vigor! First Secretary of the CPC Guiyang Municipal Committee, Wu Jiamo

    Revolutionary vigor is the heroic spirit of proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary people. Filled with revolutionary vigor, there will be bold creations and outstanding achievements, and unexpected miracles can be accomplished. In this boiling and great reality, countless new people and new things are emerging all the time. The revolutionary new forces are always ambitious, full of vigor, and enthusiastically advancing with an overwhelming force, invincible and courageous. To take Guiyang City as an example! The Nanming Typewriter Factory in Nanming District was founded in 1958 during the upsurge of the whole people running industry, starting with five workers and three pliers in a tofu workshop. We know that manufacturing a typewriter requires more than ten types of work, such as forging, casting, turning, fitting, planing, and milling, and more than 600 different parts must be made. With only three pliers, to manufacture a typewriter, it is not difficult to imagine how many difficulties would be encountered! In the eyes of some people, this is "harder than climbing to the sky," a kind of unrealistic fantasy. But the factory's workers were not intimidated by the difficulties. They endured countless tests. In the face of people who despise difficulties, difficulties were finally overcome one by one. When the manufacturing of typewriters began, 80% of the main parts were processed by factories in Shanghai. Later, Shanghai's processing tasks increased, and they no longer processed for them. What to do? Was it to "stop and dismount" or to "leap over the river"? The factory's workers chose the latter. They believed that "roads are made by people, and no difficulty is greater than our determination. If the difficulty increases by one point, our determination will grow by ten feet." They were determined to make all the parts themselves. But there were many parts and a severe shortage of equipment. Someone said, "Writing requires a pen, eating requires chopsticks, and production requires tools." What to do? They greatly modified the machines, making one machine serve multiple purposes, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and arming themselves. Without materials, they used waste materials. Without equipment for manufacturing tools, they used hand tools to file and saw. The workers said: "Ants can gnaw bones, and we will bite them out piece by piece." When modifying the milling machine, there was no planer, so they filed it by hand; when modifying the planer, there was no milling machine, so they clamped the iron bar with pliers and cut it tooth by tooth, their hands blistered, but they did not slacken, and finally modified three milling machines, pieced together two planers and twenty-five sets of punching dies from old waste materials. With some special tools, they could barely produce on their own. But then another problem came: low technical and cultural level, did not understand the symbols on the measuring tools, could not convert meters and feet, could not draw blueprints, and could not understand the blueprints even if they had them. What to do? They used the method of "drawing a gourd from a model," disassembled the typewriter, and compared each part to make it. They also ran their own spare time schools, with management cadres teaching culture and master craftsmen teaching technology. But the master craftsmen were only a few watch repairmen, who could not completely solve the technical problems of manufacturing typewriters. They helped and learned from each other, learning while doing, everyone was a teacher, everyone was a student, the workshop was a classroom, and the classroom was a battlefield. After more than a year of hard work, they had certain equipment and mastered certain technology, and all parts of the typewriter could be manufactured. But they were not satisfied with this. They wanted to strive for perfection and realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operation. From December last year to early March this year, they successfully trial-produced a general-purpose computer composed of more than 560 parts, capable of calculating twenty-digit numbers with an accuracy rate of 100%. The monthly output of typewriters increased to forty units, and the quality jumped to the top rank in the country. The degree of mechanization increased sharply from 30% to 72%. Was it okay to achieve such results? The workers' answer was: no. They said: "There are floors above floors, heavens beyond heavens, and there is still much to do!" At present, this factory is vigorously carrying out continuous production and single-machine automation, advancing towards semi-automation and automation. Another example is: the Ganyintang Rice Mill made a great technical revolution. Starting from March 20th, after eleven days of hard work by all the factory's workers, on March 30th, the entire production process was automated, solving the problem of rice for hundreds of thousands of people in Guiyang City. Under the call of the Party, all the workers of this factory organized a major assault and launched a major competition. During the assault, everyone joined the battle with full vigor and overcame numerous difficulties. Without electrical indication control instruments, they adopted the "three-in-one" method to concentrate on research and solve the problem; without telecommunications equipment, they adopted the method of self-reliance and imitated using waste materials. In order to solve the urgent need for electrical wires, the workers found short sections of electrical wires and wrapped them in paper, and also installed a conveyor belt and modified the old drum. After the factory realized automation, the output increased sharply from the original 230,000 jin per day in three shifts to 800,000 jin, and the labor productivity increased by two and a half times; the brown rice yield increased from the original 92 jin to 94.5 jin, and the quality of the rice also improved; the number of production workers decreased from the original 45 in three shifts to three, and now only one person per shift can operate all the machines in the factory for production. This factory achieved automation without spending much money, and the increased output was equivalent to building three factories of the same scale, saving the country 1.3 million yuan in investment. The workers described the current production as: "Pipelines crisscross like dragons, rows of machines turn automatically; no one comes and goes in the workshop, only the motor roars; raw materials enter the rice mill, and silver-white rice enters the warehouse."

    The Nanming Typewriter Factory is a factory that started with three pliers to make revolution, overcame countless difficulties, and grew stronger. The workers of the Ganyintang Rice Mill revolutionized for eleven days, realized automation, and solved the problem of rice processing for hundreds of thousands of people in Guiyang City. People cannot help but ask, what did they rely on? They relied on revolutionary vigor and the huge revolutionary enthusiasm generated by their lofty aspirations.

    Where does revolutionary vigor come from? Revolutionary vigor comes from a revolutionary world view. The revolutionary world view determines the revolutionary ambition. Starting from the collective or starting from the individual is the fundamental difference between the proletarian world view and the bourgeois world view. "Everyone has their own aspirations." On the issue of setting aspirations, starting from the interests of the collective, the country, and the people, or starting from one's own self-interest, reflects the fundamental opposition between the two world views. Communism is the most noble ideal of mankind and the greatest goal of revolution. When our proletarian revolutionaries set their aspirations, starting from the proletarian world view, they generated the ambition to struggle for the cause of communism throughout their lives. They linked their personal destiny with the great cause of communism, did not care about personal gains or losses, and were not satisfied with temporary gains or individual achievements. They put the collective cause first, everything started from the interests of the collective, and they did not hesitate to sacrifice everything, even to contribute their lives. They always believed in the power of the Party and the people, they despised the past, yearned for the future, based themselves on reality, boldly idealized, so they were always full of revolutionary fighting will and revolutionary optimism, and always maintained vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm.

    Our broad masses of Party members and cadres, and the broad masses of the people, all have lofty revolutionary will and have the ambition to accelerate socialist construction and realize the great ideal of communism. Our Party's great leader Chairman Mao is a shining example full of revolutionary vigor. He has always been full of revolutionary firmness and revolutionary optimism. In leading the great revolutionary struggles in which the Chinese people have turned the world upside down for decades, he has shown his outstanding Marxist-Leninist high degree of principle, his noble selfless communist spirit, and his far-sighted scientific foresight. At every important juncture of the revolutionary struggle, he always pointed out the direction of revolutionary victory and guided the people to move forward bravely according to the communist scientific and objective laws. He developed the combat theory of "continuous revolution," constantly put forward new revolutionary tasks, and led the people from one victory to another. Chairman Mao's magnificent and majestic revolutionary spirit is a concentrated expression of the noble and great revolutionary spirit of our country's revolutionary people. The lines, principles, and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao all reflect the revolutionary vigor and firm revolutionary will of the broad masses of the people. The general line for socialist construction is the embodiment of the lofty aspirations and revolutionary vigor of the broad masses of revolutionary people. Chairman Mao said: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. With more people, there are more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." Once the revolutionary vigor of the broad masses of the people in building socialism is brought into play, the construction situation will progress rapidly, it can be overwhelming, earth-shaking, and create countless miracles.

    Revolutionary vigor is by no means an abstract thing, it is embodied in people's mental state and real life. As I understand it, there are the following manifestations: (1) Having great ideals, persisting in continuous revolution, never being complacent, not being content with mediocrity, never stopping, always moving forward, striving for advancement. After completing one task, immediately go to complete another task; after reaching a new indicator, immediately start to advance towards another new and higher indicator; after innovating a technology, immediately start a new innovation, a new creation; embrace new things with infinite enthusiasm and actively support them. (2) Responding quickly, acting vigorously, grasping work early, grasping it tightly, and grasping it to the end. Resolutely implement the Party's instructions and do everything possible to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. (3) Not being content with backwardness, not being content with poverty. The worse the material conditions, the greater the determination to change the poor and backward situation, and the more resolute the revolutionary will. During the Great Leap Forward, the fact that small factories caught up with large factories, poor teams caught up with rich teams, and areas with poor economic conditions surpassed areas with good conditions, is an example of this. They are not restricted by objective conditions, and they are not conditionalists. They respect objective laws and fully exert people's subjective initiative, turning bad things into good things and backwardness into advancement. (4) Being full of revolutionary optimism, daring to act, working hard, and not being afraid of difficulties. In the face of difficulties, they demonstrated the heroic spirit of unswerving proletarian revolutionary fighters, firmly believing that "everything depends on human effort," not being discouraged, not giving up halfway, but having to persist in the spirit of continuous revolution until reaching the Great Wall, and having to struggle for the cause of communism throughout their lives.

    The development of any thing is a unity of opposites, and any thing has two sides. Vigor and lethargy are two opposing things. In our revolutionary ranks, the vast majority of comrades are full of vigor and enthusiasm, but there are also a few people who have lethargy and right-leaning tendencies. Although this is not the mainstream, allowing it to develop will inevitably bring losses to the revolutionary cause. This deserves our high vigilance, constant struggle, maintaining vigor, and eliminating lethargy.

    Strong grass is known in a high wind. Only in struggle, in rapids, and in storms can people be accurately identified. In the future, in the cause of revolutionary construction, we will still encounter various difficulties. This requires us to have a firm belief in victory, always be promoters of the revolution, like the pines on the mountains, withstand the storms; like the rocks by the sea, withstand the turbulent waves; like the Yangtze River, always surging forward; like the rising sun, spraying clouds and breaking fog and rising steadily.

    Long live revolutionary vigor!

    革命朝气万岁！	中共贵阳市委第一书记　伍嘉谟
    革命的朝气，是无产阶级革命战士和革命人民的英雄气质。充满着革命朝气，就有大胆的创造和卓越的建树，就可以干出人们意想不到的奇迹来，在这沸腾着的伟大现实生活中，时时刻刻都在涌现出无数的新人新事。革命的新生力量总是志大心雄，朝气勃勃，热气腾腾，以高屋建瓴之势，无坚不摧，勇往直前。远的不说，就以贵阳市来举个例子吧！南明区有一个南明打字机厂，是1958年全民大办工业的时候，由五个工人，三把老虎钳，在一家豆腐坊里起家的。我们知道制造一台打字机，需要锻、铸、车、钳、刨、铣等十多个工种，要做出六百多个大小不同的部件。只有三把老虎钳，就要制造打字机，不难想像，该会遇到多少的困难！在有些人看来，这是“难上难，难于上青天”，是脱离实际的一种幻想。但是这个厂的职工并没有被困难所吓倒，他们经受了无数次的考验，在藐视困难的人们面前，困难终于被一个接一个地克服了。开始制造打字机的时候，80％的主要部件是由上海的工厂加工，后来上海加工的任务增加，不再给他们加工了。怎么办？是“停车下马”呢？还是“跃马过河”？厂里的职工选择了后者，他们认为“路是人走出来的，困难再大，大不过我们的决心，困难大一分，我们的决心长一丈”。他们下定决心，全部部件都由自己来搞。但是部件多，设备奇缺，有人说：“写字得用笔，吃饭得用筷，搞生产得用工具。”怎么办？他们就大改机器，要一机多用，土洋并举，自己武装自己。没有材料，就利用废材。没有制造工具的设备，就用手工工具来锉、来锯，工人们说：
  “蚂蚁能啃骨头，我们就要一口一口把它咬出来。”改装铣床时没有刨床，就用手工锉；改装刨床时没有铣床，就用老虎钳夹着元铁一齿一齿地开，两手起泡，也毫不松劲，终于改装成了三部铣床，利用旧废料拼凑成了两部刨床和二十五副冲模具。有了一部分专用工具以后，勉强可以自行生产。但是问题又来了，技术、文化水平低，量具上的符号不懂，米和英尺不会换算，图纸不会画，有了图纸也看不懂。怎么办？他们就用“比着葫芦画瓢”的办法，将打字机拆下来，一件一件地比着干。并自办业余学校，管理干部教文化，老师傅讲技术。但是老师傅也仅仅是几个修表工人，不能完全解决制造打字机的技术问题，他们就互助互学，边干边学，大家是先生，大家是学生，车间是课堂，课堂是战场。经过一年多的努力，有了一定的设备，掌握了一定的技术，打字机的全部部件能够制造了。但是他们并不就此满足，他们要精益求精，要实现手工操作机械化、半机械化。从去年12月份到今年3月初，他们试制成功了由五百六十多个部件组成的，能计算二十位数字的准确率达到100％的通用计算机。打字机的月产量提高到四十部，质量跃居全国优等。机械化的程度由30％猛增到72％。取得这样的成绩行了吗？工人们的回答是：不。他们说：“楼外有楼，天外有天，要干的还多着呢！”目前这个厂正大搞生产连续化，单机自动化，向半自动化、自动化进军。另一个例子是：甘荫塘制米厂大闹技术革命，从3月20日开始，经过全厂职工十一天奋战，于3月30日，全部生产过程实现了自动化，解决了贵阳市几十万人的食米问题。这个厂的全体职工，在党的号召下，组织了大突击，开展了大竞赛。在突击中，人人上阵，朝气十足，克服了重重困难。没有电示操纵仪表，他们就采取“三结合”办法，集中研究解决；没有电讯器材，就采取自力更生的办法，利用废旧料进行仿制。为了解决急需的电线问题，工人们便自己找短节电线包纸，还安装了传送带，改装了旧滚筒。全厂实现自动化后，产量由原来三班日产二十三万斤，猛增到八十万斤，劳动生产率提高两倍半；糙米出米率由原来九十二斤提高到九十四斤半，大米的质量也有提高；生产工人由原来三班四十五人减为三人，现在每班只要一人就能操纵全厂所有机器进行生产。这厂没有花几文钱就实现了自动化，所增产量等于新建三个同样规模的工厂，为国家节约一百三十万元投资。工人形容目前的生产是：“管道纵横似蛟龙，成行机器自转动；车间不见人来往，只听马达响隆隆；原料进入打米机，银色白米进仓中。”
    南明打字机制造厂，是三把老虎钳闹革命，克服无数困难，壮大起来的工厂。甘荫塘制米厂职工十一天革个命，实现自动化，解决了贵阳市几十万人吃米加工问题。人们不禁要问，他们凭的是什么？他们凭的是革命朝气，凭的是雄心壮志所产生的一股巨大的革命干劲。
    革命朝气从何而来！革命朝气来自革命的世界观。革命的世界观，决定着革命的大志。从集体出发，还是从个人出发，这是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的根本分歧。“人各有志”，在立志的问题上，从集体、国家、人民的利益出发，还是从一己的私利出发，反映着两种世界观的根本对立。共产主义是人类最崇高的理想，是革命最伟大的目标。我们无产阶级的革命家在立志的时候，从无产阶级的世界观出发，就产生了为共产主义事业毕生奋斗的雄心大志。他们把个人的命运和伟大的共产主义事业联系在一起，不计较个人得失，不满足于一时之得、一己之功。他们把集体的事业放在第一位，一切从集体的利益出发，不惜牺牲一切，甚至贡献自己的生命。他们永远相信党和人民的力量，他们藐视过去，向往未来，立足现实，大胆理想，因而他们任何时候都充满着革命的战斗意志和革命的乐观主义精神，永远保持着旺盛的革命干劲。
    我们的广大党员和干部，广大的人民群众都具有崇高的革命意志，都具有加速社会主义建设、实现共产主义远大理想的大志。我们党的伟大领袖毛主席就是充满着革命朝气的光辉典范。他从来就充满着革命的坚定性和革命的乐观主义精神。在领导中国人民几十年来翻天覆地的伟大的革命斗争中，都表现出他杰出的马克思列宁主义的高度原则性，表现出他崇高的大无畏的共产主义精神，表现出他高瞻远瞩的科学预见性。在革命斗争的每一个重要关头，他总是根据共产主义的科学客观法则，指出革命胜利的方向，引导人民勇往直前。他发挥了“不断革命”的战斗学说，不断提出新的革命任务，领导人民从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。毛主席这种宏伟的、气势磅礴的革命浩然之气，正是我国革命人民崇高的、伟大的革命精神的集中表现。以毛主席为首的党中央所制订的路线、方针和各项政策，无一不反映着广大人民的革命朝气和坚强的革命意志。社会主义建设总路线就是广大革命人民的雄心壮志、革命朝气的体现。毛主席说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”广大人民建设社会主义的革命朝气，一经发挥，建设形势就一日千里，就能排山倒海，掀天复地，就能创造无数的奇迹。
    革命的朝气决不是抽象的东西，它体现在人们的精神状态与现实生活中。据我理解，有以下几种表现：（1）具有伟大的理想，坚持不断革命，永不自满，不甘居中游，永不停顿，永远向前，力争上游。在完成一个任务之后，立即去完成另一个任务；达到一个新的指标，马上又开始向另一个新的更高的指标进军；革新一项技术之后，又立即开始新的革新，新的创造；对新生事物，抱无限热情，积极支持。（2）闻风而起，雷厉风行，工作抓得早、抓得紧、抓到底。执行党的指示坚决，千方百计完成党交给的任务。（3）不安于落后，不安于穷。越是物质条件差，要求改变穷困落后状况的决心越大，革命的意志越坚决。在大跃进中，那些小厂赶大厂，穷队赶富队，经济条件差的地区超过条件好的地区，便是这方面的范例。他们不受客观条件的束缚，不是唯条件论者，他们尊重客观规律而又充分发挥人的主观能动性，把坏事变好事，落后变先进。（4）充满着革命乐观主义精神，敢作敢为，艰苦勤劳，不怕困难。在困难面前表现了坚定不移的无产阶级革命战士的英雄气概，坚定地相信“事在人为”，不气馁，不中途而废，而是不到长城非好汉，一定要坚持不断革命的精神，一定要为共产主义事业毕生奋斗。
    任何事物的发展都是对立的统一，任何事物都有两面性。朝气和暮气就是两个相对立的东西。在我们革命队伍中，绝大多数的同志朝气勃勃，干劲冲天，但也还有少数人存在着暮气和右倾，这虽然不是主流，但是任其发展，必然对革命事业带来损失。这就值得我们高度警惕，不断地进行斗争，保持朝气，清除暮气。
    疾风知劲草，在斗争中，在急流中，在急风骤雨中，才能准确地识别人。今后，在革命建设事业中，仍然会遇到各种各样的困难。这就需要我们具有坚定的胜利信心，永远当革命的促进派，像山上的苍松，顶得住疾风暴雨；像海边岩石，经得起惊涛骇浪；像长江大河，永远奔腾前进；像初出的朝阳，喷云破雾蒸蒸而上。
    革命朝气万岁！
