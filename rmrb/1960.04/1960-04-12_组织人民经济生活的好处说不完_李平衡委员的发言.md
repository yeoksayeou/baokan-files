Chairman, fellow members:

I have listened to the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I am extremely excited, and I wholeheartedly support these four reports.

Recently, I read some materials on organizing the economic life of urban residents and took the opportunity to visit several street-level organizations in Beijing. I was greatly inspired and encouraged. Now I would like to talk about my preliminary understanding of this issue and ask for your guidance.

I. Developing Production and Improving Living Standards

Under the glorious guidance of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, thousands upon thousands of urban residents, especially housewives, have successively stepped out of their narrow family circles and participated in the great construction of the motherland. According to the figures from forty-three cities at the end of 1959, there were more than 44,000 production units run by street residents, with more than 1.4 million people engaged in production, of which women accounted for more than 80%. The total value of street production last year reached more than 2 billion yuan. In many cities, a thriving scene of "everyone is busy with production, and every household has no idle people" has emerged in the streets.

As a large number of housewives and some idle laborers participated in street production, things that used to belong to family daily life, such as cooking, washing clothes, and taking care of children, have become social issues. Therefore, the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life have become the urgent demands of the broad masses. The Party is the leader and organizer of the cause of revolution and construction, and it is also the leader and organizer of the people's lives. Caring for the lives of the masses is the Party's consistent policy. Under such new circumstances, the streets of many cities across the country, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, organized the masses, relied on the masses, and launched a great mass movement to further organize the people's economic life. Under the principle of everyone doing things for themselves and the masses managing their own lives, with production as the center, the masses are helped to make comprehensive and rational arrangements for eating, clothing, and all the things needed in daily life. This is an extremely important task in urban work, so that the broad masses can reduce worries about family affairs and do their work better. With the active support of the masses, the street Party committees have grasped both production and life. Over the past year or so, street collective welfare and social service undertakings have developed rapidly, and a brand-new situation has gradually emerged in which housework is moving towards socialization and people's lives are moving towards collectivization.

There are many specific contents of street collective welfare and social service undertakings, but the main aspects are as follows:

	(1) Public canteens. Canteens are a central link in collective welfare. Women participate in production, so naturally they cannot go home to cook. In order to solve this contradiction, it is necessary to run public canteens on a large scale. I saw three types of canteens in Beijing: large, medium, and small. Large ones can not only provide meals for thousands of people, but also make food for medium and small canteens. Medium-sized canteens are set up for the convenience of production workers living nearby, supplying meals to dozens or hundreds of people. Small canteens are "big courtyard canteens," that is, three to five or seven to eight families living in the same courtyard join together, with one or two people cooking for everyone in the courtyard. The cooks in the large canteens have all studied on their own and learned cooking from chefs in local large restaurants. Therefore, they can always make a dozen or so dishes every day for people to choose from. The prices of the dishes include economy dishes, from two or three cents to one dime, and custom-made dishes, which can be as expensive as three dimes. People can eat in the canteen or take the food home to eat as they please. When we visitors saw this actual situation and compared it with our own small-scale cooking at home, everyone felt that public canteens were good, economical, and convenient, with so many benefits.
	(2) Nurseries (including kindergartens). The nursery service includes full-time, day-care, and temporary care. Full-time and day-care are the same as general nurseries and daycare centers. Temporary care is specially for parents who have temporary business and need to leave their children for a few hours or a day. The several nurseries I saw were all good. The administrators and caregivers carefully studied nutrition and hygiene knowledge, etc. From the cleanliness and hygiene of the nursery to the children's health and clothing, one could see that they took care of the children wholeheartedly. When a nursery run by a street office in Xuanwu District of Beijing was first established, only the children of people participating in street production were enrolled. The children of general office workers were unwilling to send their children there. After they discovered that this nursery was run really well, they asked to enroll their children one after another. Now, in addition to trying to enroll the children of people participating in street production, 40% of the children in this nursery are the children of office workers.
	(3) Service network. The street service network is composed of service centers, service stations, and comprehensive service personnel. The service items are as many as one hundred, covering almost everything from food, clothing, housing, and transportation to birth, old age, illness, and death. The service time is regardless of morning, evening, day, or night, and regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow. The service methods include entrusting services at the service station, handing the key to the door to the service staff so that they can deliver things into the house or clean the room, light the stove, etc. The service staff asks about the services by visiting the house, asking regularly what services are needed and then doing them accordingly. There are also cases where people do not need to entrust the service station, nor do they need the service staff to visit first and then do the work. As soon as they find that someone needs something done, the service staff will take the initiative to do it for them. For example, when the city inspected street sanitation, an elderly single woman was worried because she could not clean her house due to arthritis. Suddenly, two unfamiliar young girls came, one cleaned and the other wiped the glass. After the work was done, they gave her some kind comfort before leaving. A housewife who came from the old society and had little contact with the outside world personally encountered such a thing that she had never seen before, which surprised and moved her. She was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes and she could not speak. There are countless inspiring deeds done by the service station staff, which cannot be fully described. People call them "logistical soldiers of production" and "housekeepers of the masses," which is not an exaggeration at all. In short, people have stepped out of their narrow families, participated in collective production, and lived a collective life, establishing collectivist thinking. In the big socialist family in the streets, the relationship between people and the entire mental outlook have greatly changed.

II. The Superiority of Street Production Undertakings

There are many advantages to street production undertakings. The most important aspects are as follows:

	(1) Turning the negative into the positive and turning consumers into producers. The people who participate in street production are generally unemployed urban consumers. Now these people have left their homes, especially housewives. They engage in street production without the need for the state to allocate labor and funds, starting from scratch, making do with whatever is available, and growing from small to large. This mobilizes a large number of idle laborers, thoroughly liberates housewives, increases family income, and establishes a new force on the production front.
	(2) Turning the useless into the useful and using waste materials and scraps to create wealth for society. During the period of the overall leap forward in our national economy, the supply of raw materials is relatively tight. Street production undertakings often use discarded materials for production. For example, using the scraps and waste materials from machinery factories to manufacture knives, scissors, awls, etc. A street cotton mill in Beijing recycles more than 680,000 catties of waste cotton yarn a year, which is processed and supplied to 18 state-owned factories for machine maintenance. Last year, the output value of production using waste materials alone reached more than 230,000 yuan.
	(3) Street production undertakings are powerful assistants to state-owned factories and "satellite" factories of large industries. Street production is generally processing for large factories. Forty-five of the seventy-six street factories on Xing'an Road in Tianjin are processing in nature. Thirteen of the twenty-two street factories in Beixinqiao, Beijing, process production for 113 local state-owned industries and handicraft cooperatives, producing 127 kinds of products. Last year, the output value reached more than 3 million yuan. With such street production undertakings providing processing services for large factories, large factories can free up their strength to carry out the production of high-end products and create favorable conditions for technological innovation and technological revolution.
	(4) Street production undertakings are mostly service-oriented undertakings, carrying out production to meet the daily needs of citizens. According to the needs of citizens, urban agencies, schools, etc., all production activities are carried out to serve the people according to local conditions and according to the time. Such as repairing houses, radios, bicycles, electric lights, tap water, sewing clothes, socks, sweaters, gloves, and manufacturing soap, washing powder, and other daily necessities. This kind of service-oriented production activity not only brings many conveniences to residents, but also reduces a lot of burden for the country in terms of supply.
	(5) Transforming the city and also transforming people. By organizing the people's economic life, grasping both production and life, we can not only transform the ancient consumer cities into new-type production cities, but also organize thousands of women and some idle laborers who are confined to their families to engage in production. Through labor practice and collective life, in the entire socialist environment education, they can transform themselves into self-reliant working people. In the new stage of socialist construction in our country, this kind of organization is of extremely great significance.

III. We Must Correctly Understand the Great Significance of Organizing the People's Economic Life

The comprehensive organization of the people's economic life is the product of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. It is the inevitable result of the high-speed development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's political consciousness. Everyone knows that what kind of society we live in determines what kind of mode of production we have. What kind of mode of production determines what kind of way of life we must have. Our country has entered a new stage of high-speed socialist construction. Our mode of production is a socialist large collective mode of production, while our small-scale cooking at home and fragmented individual lives are not adapted to the socialist collective mode of production. This inevitably requires the socialization of housework and the collectivization of decentralized life. This is an inevitable trend of objective development, the aspiration of the people, and the general trend. No one should stop it, and no one can stop it.

At present, a magnificent mass movement to comprehensively organize the people's economic life is rising in cities across the country. This is a movement for urban residents to move towards a happy and better life, and it is an extremely good thing. However, this is also an extremely profound socialist revolution, because it is related to the fundamental transformation of everyone's living habits. In the face of this situation, for intellectuals from the old society, including myself, it should be said that this is a serious test. We should recognize that organizing the economic life of urban residents is the only way to transform the old cities into new socialist cities. It is a victorious development of the rural people's communes and a positive factor in accelerating the construction of socialism in our country. Everyone should respond to the call of the Party and the state, actively participate in this movement, be promoters in this great movement, and accept further socialist transformation from this movement, transform our political stance, transform our world outlook, and transform ourselves into new people. We must be ideologically prepared, use a positive and enthusiastic attitude, and join the broad masses to welcome this radiant new thing and promote its growth and strengthening in a short period of time!

    组织人民经济生活的好处说不完
    李平衡委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席所作的报告。我感到万分兴奋，我衷心拥护这四个报告。
    最近一个时期，我看了一点关于组织城市人民经济生活的材料和利用视察的机会参观过北京市几处街道工作。我受到了极大的启发和鼓舞。现在我想就这个问题，谈谈我的初步体会，请各位指教。
    一、发展生产、改善生活
    在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，千千万万的城市居民特别是家庭妇女，陆续走出了狭小的家庭圈子，参加了祖国的伟大建设事业。据1959年底的四十三个城市的数字，街道居民所办的生产事业有四万四千多个单位，生产人数有一百四十多万人，其中妇女占80％以上。去年一年的街道生产的产值达到二十多亿元。许多城市的街道里出现了“人人忙生产，户户无闲人”这样的兴旺气象。
    由于大量家庭妇女和一些闲散有劳动力的人们参加了街道生产，一向属于家庭日常生活的事情，如烧饭、洗衣、带孩子等这些问题，都变成为社会的问题了。因而，家务劳动社会化，生活集体化就成为广大群众的迫切要求。党是革命和建设事业的领导者和组织者，也是人民生活的领导者和组织者。关心群众的生活是党的一贯的方针。在这样新形势之下，全国许许多多的城市的街道，在党委统一领导下，组织群众，依靠群众，开展了一个进一步组织人民经济生活伟大的群众运动。在大家事情大家办，群众生活群众管的原则下，以生产为中心，帮助群众把吃的、穿的以及家常一切所需要解决的事情，进行全面合理的安排。使广大群众减少家庭事务的顾虑，把工作做得更好，这是城市工作中一个极其重要任务。街道党委在群众积极支持下，一面抓生产，一面抓生活，一年多来街道集体生活福利和社会服务事业，得到了迅速的发展，并且逐步出现了家务劳动走向社会化，人民生活走向集体化崭新的局面。
    街道集体生活福利和社会服务事业的具体内容很多，但主要的有以下几个方面：
      （一）公共食堂。食堂是集体生活福利的一个中心环节。妇女参加了生产，自然不能回家做饭，为了解决这个矛盾，必须大办公共食堂。我在北京看到的食堂有大、中、小三种。大的不但可以供上千人的伙食，而且可以为中、小食堂代做食品。中型食堂是为附近居民的生产劳动者便利而办的，供应量约在几十人至百人。小型食堂是大杂院食堂，即住在一个院子里三五家至十家八家合起来由一二人做，供全院里人吃。大食堂的炊事员，都经过自己钻研和当地大餐馆的厨司传授烹调。因此，每天总能做出十好几样菜，供人挑选。菜价有经济菜，二三分至一角，又有定做菜贵的至三角。人们在食堂里吃，或拿回家吃听便。我们参观的人，一面看了这样实际情况，一面比照自家那样小锅小灶的做法，没有人不感到公共食堂又好、又经济、又方便，实在好处太多。
      （二）托儿所（包括幼儿园）。托儿事业有全托、日托和临时托三种。全托、日托与一般的托儿所、托儿站一样。临时托是专为家长临时有事，把小孩寄托几小时或一天。我所看到的几个托儿所都好，所的行政上和保育员们都细心钻研营养学和卫生常识等等，从所内的清洁卫生到儿童的健康和衣履，都能看出她们全心全意的照管儿童。北京宣武区一个街道办事处的一个托儿所，成立之初的时候，寄托的儿童只有参加街道生产的人员的儿童，一般机关工作人员的儿童都不愿送去寄托，到了他们发现这个托儿所办的真好之后，纷纷要求收纳他们的孩子。现在这个托儿所除了尽量收托参加街道生产人员的儿童而外，还有40％的儿童是机关工作人员的儿童。
    （三）服务网。由服务所、服务站和综合服务员组成街道服务网。服务项目多至一百多项，从衣食住行，到生老病死，几乎无所不包。服务时间，不分早晚昼夜，不分风霜雨雪。服务的方式，有到服务站委托服务的，把锁门的钥匙交给服务员，让他们好送东西进屋或打扫房间、生火炉等等。服务员上门询问服务的，服务员定时上门询问，须要那些服务，然后照办。也有既不要到服务站委托，又不要服务人员先访后办，只要发觉了某人需要办某事，服务人员就主动的为他办了。如本市检查街道卫生时，某单身老大娘，因关节炎不能打扫房屋而正在发愁的时候，忽然来了两个不相识的小姑娘，一个打扫，一个擦玻璃，事情做完了，并对她亲切的安慰一番才去。一个不大与外界接触的旧社会过来的家庭妇女，亲身遇到生平未见过的这样事情，使她既惊奇又感动，一时激动到双泪夺眶，连话也说不出了，服务站人员做了多少令人振奋的事迹，是说不尽的，人们称之为
  “生产的后勤兵”，“群众的管家人”，一点也不夸大。总之，人们走出了狭隘的家庭，参加集体生产，过着集体生活，树立了集体主义思想，在街道里社会主义社会大家庭中，人与人的关系和整个精神面貌，已经大大改变了。
    二、街道生产事业的优越性街道生产事业优越性很多，最主要的有这样几个方面：
      （一）化消极为积极，变消费者为生产者。参加街道生产的人员，一般都是没有就业、城市的消费者，现在这些人走出了家门，特别是家庭妇女，他们搞街道生产，不需国家配给劳力和资金，白手起家，因陋就简，从小到大，这就调动了广大的闲散劳动力，彻底解放了家庭妇女，为家庭增加收入，在生产战线上树立一支新的力量。
      （二）化无用为有用，利用废旧物资和下脚料为社会创造财富。在我国国民经济全面跃进的时期，原料供应，比较紧张，街道生产事业，往往是利用废弃的物资，进行生产。如利用机械工厂的边角、废料制造刀剪、锥子等。北京一个街道棉丝厂，一年回收废棉线六十八万多斤，加工以后，供应十八个国营工厂维修机器的用途，去年光是利用废旧物资生产的产值就达到二十三万多元。
      （三）街道生产事业是国营工厂的有力的助手，大工业的“卫星”工厂。街道生产，一般是为大工厂加工的。天津兴安路七十六街道工厂，其中就有四十五个是加工性质的。北京北新桥二十二个街道工厂就有十三个为一百一十三个地方国营工业和手工业合作社进行加工生产，出产一百二十七种产品，去年一年产值达三百多万元之多。有了这样的街道生产事业为大工厂加工服务，这就可以使大工厂腾出力量，进行高级产品的生产，和为技术革新、技术革命创造有利条件。
    （四）街道生产事业大都是服务性的事业，为满足市民日常生活需要进行生产。根据市民、市内机关、学校等需要，因地制宜、因时制宜进行一切为人民服务的生产活动。如修理房屋、收音机、自行车、电灯、自来水，缝制衣袜、毛衣、手套以及制造肥皂、洗衣粉等日常所需要解决的事情。这种服务性的生产活动，不仅给居民带来许多便利，而且还能为国家在供应方面减轻了不少负担。
      （五）改造了城市，也改造了人。通过组织人民经济生活，既抓生产，又抓生活，不仅把古老的消费城市变为新型的生产城市，而且还能把千千万万的束缚在家庭中的妇女和一些闲散有劳动力的人们，组织起来，从事生产，通过劳动实践和集体生活，在整个社会主义的环境教育中，把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动人民。在我国社会主义建设新阶段的时期，这种组织是有极其重大意义的。
    三、要正确认识组织人民经济生活的重大意义
    全面组织人民经济生活是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的产物。它是国民经济高速度发展和人民群众政治觉悟不断提高的必然结果。大家知道，我们生活在什么样的社会，就有什么样的生产方式。有什么样的生产方式，就决定要有什么样生活方式。我们国家进入了高速度建设社会主义的新阶段，我们的生产方式是社会主义大集体的生产方式，而我们小锅小灶、零零碎碎的个体生活是与社会主义集体的生产方式不相适应的，这就必然要求家务劳动走向社会化，分散生活走向集体化。这是客观发展的必然趋势，人心所向，大势所趋，谁也不应该阻挡，而且也是阻挡不了的。
    目前全国各城市正在兴起一个波澜壮阔的全面组织人民经济生活伟大的群众运动，是城市居民走向幸福美好生活的运动，是一桩极大的好事。但是，这又是一场极为深刻的社会主义革命，因为，它关系到每个人的生活习惯的根本变革。在这种形势的面前，对于从旧社会过来的知识分子包括我本人在内，应该说是一次严重的考验。我们应当认识，组织城市人民经济生活，是使旧城市改造成为社会主义新城市的必经途径，是农村人民公社胜利的发展，是加速建设我国社会主义的积极因素。我们每一个人，应当响应党和国家的号召，积极投入这个运动，在这个伟大运动中当促进派，并从这个运动中去接受进一步的社会主义改造，改造政治立场，改造世界观，把自己改造成为新人。我们要有思想准备，要用积极热情的态度，和广大群众一起，去迎接这个光芒四射的新生事物，促使它在很快的时期内成长而壮大起来！
