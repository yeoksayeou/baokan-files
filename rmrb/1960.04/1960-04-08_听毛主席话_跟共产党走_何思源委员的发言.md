Listen to Chairman Mao, Follow the Communist Party
Speech by Committee Member He Siyuan

Chairman, fellow committee members:

Our country is now in a new period of continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and continued great leap forward in socialist construction. In order to adapt to this excellent situation, to make greater contributions to the socialist cause, for our own bright future, we must wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, and wholeheartedly serve socialism; take into consideration the interests of the state and the people, and lean to the side of socialism. However, for old military and political personnel like me, it is not easy to do this. First of all, we must actively strive for the leadership and education of the Party, accelerate the transformation of ourselves, and thoroughly transform ourselves.

I would like to report to you some of my superficial experiences in striving to achieve the four "wholeheartednesses," "taking one head into consideration," and "leaning to one side," based on some of the facts I have experienced in the past ten years.

In 1949, Beijing had just been liberated. I carried the burden of having contributed a little to the peaceful liberation of Beijing, and always thought that the Communist Party would give me high positions and generous salaries. This was entirely based on personal gains and losses. I didn't think about: In the decades I spent in the Kuomintang ruling clique, did I make contributions to the people, or did I commit crimes against them? Should I reach out to the people to claim credit, or honestly atone for my sins?

In 1950, the Party sent me to study at the Political Research Institute of the Revolutionary University. This was a good opportunity for me to study theory and transform my thinking. However, I felt that instead of giving me a suitable job, they sent me to study, putting me in the cold. I didn't say it, but I was secretly resentful in my heart. During my time at the Revolutionary University, although I learned some theoretical knowledge from books and sometimes expressed enthusiasm, my main purpose was to find a way out for myself, so I didn't make much progress.

After graduating from the Revolutionary University, I went to work at the People's Publishing House. Because I still had some book knowledge and understood several languages, and I also learned some basic revolutionary theory at the Revolutionary University, I did some work in translation, reviewing, and proofreading. From 1951 to 1957, in addition to the daily work of reviewing and proofreading at the publishing house, I also translated, wrote, and published more than a dozen books. I thought I had made progress, and I mistakenly thought that I was taking care of both the public and the individual. In fact, I was still only taking care of one head – the head of personal interests. Therefore, in my work, I was often hesitant, worried about gains and losses, and constrained, and I did not fully exert the power I could have exerted or make the contribution I should have made. Strictly speaking, not only was the work not done well, but especially my thinking did not get the progress it should have, and I was always unable to feel comfortable. Everything about the new China was forced joy. This was truly wanting to take care of both heads, but ending up empty-handed in both.

The lesson of failing to take care of both heads was given to me by the great anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, which gave me a profound education and made me change my understanding. In 1958, the Party's general line and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture encouraged us, and the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers and peasants moved us. Committee member Weng Wenhao and I resumed the responsibility of editing the "French-Chinese Dictionary." Before this, I had proposed compiling this dictionary in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, but it was stopped soon after it started, mainly because I was still taking care of the head of personal interests. For the interests of the people, it was fake; for personal interests, it was real. Therefore, I slackened my efforts as soon as I encountered difficulties in my work.

After the rectification movement, Committee member Weng Wenhao, Committee member Li Pingheng and I, as well as several comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang who understood French, restarted this work on the basis of a new ideological understanding. We only thought of the Party's call for a great leap forward in science and technology, and did not consider anything else. I dare say that none of us three considered personal interests in this regard. So we abandoned all previous drafts and started rewriting from scratch. After a year and a half of effort, we have now basically completed the first draft of this dictionary – about 90,000 entries, 5 million words. We are currently reviewing, proofreading, printing, and transcribing it, and strive to publish it next year as a gift to the 40th anniversary of the Party.

After the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion last year, domestic and foreign countries paid attention to the Tibetan issue. I felt that it was necessary to write about the situation in Tibet, so I cooperated with Committee members Ju Zan, Fang Yuyan, Li Zuyin, and Jiao Shizhai to write 200,000 to 300,000 words of various Tibetan materials. We also plan to continue writing to provide reference for studying the local situation in Tibet.

In the past two years, my work has been more intense than before. This is because I feel that the happy events of the great leap forward in all aspects are just like my own happy events. As the saying goes, people are refreshed when they encounter happy events; every day there are happy events, so every day I am refreshed. I like this kind of meaningful tension, so I live a tense life, but my mood is very comfortable, and my body is even stronger. At the same time, in these two tasks, my thinking has also been transformed to a certain extent.

From my experiences over the past ten years, I have realized that as long as I "wholeheartedly" listen to Chairman Mao's words, "wholeheartedly" follow the Communist Party, "wholeheartedly" accept transformation, "wholeheartedly" serve socialism, "consider one head, and lean to one side," that is the only way to do a good job, the only way to transform thinking; and at the same time, I can also gain the importance and trust of the people. From my experiences over the past ten years, I have also realized that in reality, no one takes care of both heads, only one head. Communists and those who stand firm on the proletarian position only take care of the head of the interests of the people; old military and political personnel like me and those who stand on the bourgeois position only take care of the head of personal interests. Which head to take care of? In the final analysis, it is a matter of position.

Chairman Mao said at the Second Session of the First National Committee of this conference in 1950: "As long as anyone is willing to truly serve the people, truly help the people during the period when they still have difficulties, do good deeds, and continue to do so consistently without giving up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason to not want him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve." The ironclad facts of the past ten years have confirmed Chairman Mao's wise instructions. The Party and the government will not treat us badly. The question now is whether we can make up our minds to thoroughly transform the bourgeois position and world outlook, only take care of the head of national interests and the interests of the people, and lean to the side of socialism.

Although I am 65 years old this year, I am determined, under the leadership and education of the Party, not only to serve socialism to the end, but also to strive to serve communism. I will dedicate myself to the cause until my heart stops beating.

### 听毛主席话　跟共产党走  何思源委员的发言

    听毛主席话　跟共产党走
    何思源委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我国现在正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设继续跃进的新时期，为了适应这个大好形势，为了给社会主义事业做出较大的贡献，为了自己的光明前途，我们必须一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟着共产党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务；顾国家利益、人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。可是，像我这样的旧军政人员，要做到这一点，是很不容易的，首先是要主动积极争取党的领导和教育，加速改造自己，彻底改造自己。
    我想根据我自己在这十年来所经历的一些事实，向同志们汇报一下我对力争做到四个“一心一意”、“顾一头”、“一边倒”的一些肤浅的体会。
    1949年北京刚刚解放，我背着对和平解放北京尽了一点力量的包袱，总以为共产党会给我以高官厚禄，这完全是以个人的得失为出发点的；我却不想一想：我在国民党统治集团几十年，究竟对人民有功呢，还是有罪呢？是向人民伸手邀功呢，还是老老实实立功赎罪呢？
    1950年，党派我到革命大学政治研究院学习，这是给我一个学习理论、改造思想的好机会。可是，我却认为不给我一个相当的工作，反叫我去学习，是把我打入冷宫。嘴里不说，心里却暗暗地忿忿不平。在革大期间，我虽然学得一些书本上的理论，有时也表示积极，但主要目的是为了自己找出路，因此进步不大。
    革大毕业以后，我到人民出版社工作。由于我还具备一些书本知识，懂得几国文字，在革大又学了点基本的革命理论，因此，在翻译、审稿、校阅等方面，做了一点工作。从1951年到1957年，除了出版社的审稿、校阅等日常工作，我还翻译、写作，出版了十几本书。我就认为我有了进步，我错误的以为这是既顾了公家，也顾了个人，两头都顾到了。其实这仍然是只顾一头——顾个人利益的一头。因此，在工作中常是瞻前顾后、患得患失、束手束脚，并没有充分发挥出我可以发挥的力量，作出我应该做的贡献。严格地说：工作不但没做好，特别是使自己的思想没得到应有的进步，心情总是不能舒畅，对于新中国的一切都是强颜为欢。这真是想顾两头，而两头落空。
    这个顾两头两头都落空的教训，是通过伟大的反右派斗争和整风运动，给了我深刻的教育，使我在认识上有了转变。1958年，党的总路线和工农业大跃进鼓励了我们，广大工农群众的革命干劲感动了我们，我和翁文灏委员等又重新负起编辑“法汉大字典”的责任。在这以前我曾在民革提议编这部字典，可是动手不久就停顿了，主要是因为我还是顾个人利益这一头，对于人民利益，是假的；对于个人利益是真的；因此工作中稍遇困难，就松了劲。
    整风运动后，翁文灏委员、李平衡委员和我，以及民革的几位懂法文的同志，在新的思想认识基础上重新搞起这项工作，我们只想到党提出的在科学技术上大跃进的号召，不计其他，我敢说，我们三个人在这一点上，都没有顾个人利益。于是废弃全部前稿，从头重新编写。经过一年半的努力，现在已经基本完成这部字典的初稿——约九万多辞条，五百万字。目前正在进行审核、校正、打印、誊清中，争取明年出版，向党的四十周年纪念献礼。
    在去年平息西藏叛乱事件以后，国内外注视西藏问题，我认为有写出关于西藏情况资料的必要，就与巨赞、方与严、李祖荫、焦实斋等委员合作，写了二、三十万字的西藏各种资料，我们还准备继续增写，供研究西藏地方情况的参考。
    这两年来，我的工作比过去紧张。这是我感到各方面大跃进的喜事，就如同我自己的喜事一样。常言道，人逢喜事精神爽；天天有喜事，就天天精神爽快，我喜欢这种有意义的紧张，因此过着紧张的生活，心情却反而很舒畅，身体反倒更为健壮了。同时，在这两项工作中，我的思想也得到了一定程度的改造。
    我从十年来的经历中认识到：只要“一心一意”听毛主席的话，“一心一意”跟着共产党走，“一心一意”接受改造，“一心一意”为社会主义服务，“顾一头，一边倒”，才是做好工作的唯一道路，才是改造思想的唯一途径；同时也能够得到人民的重视和信任。我从十年来的经历中还认识到：实际上任何人没有顾两头，只有顾一头的。共产党员和站稳无产阶级立场的人只顾人民利益的一头；像我这样旧军政人员和站在资产阶级立场的人只顾个人利益的一头。顾哪一头？归根到底是立场问题。
    毛主席在1950年本会第一届全国委员会第二次会议上说：“只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，做了好事，并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，那末，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。”十年来铁一般的事实，印证着毛主席的英明指示。党和政府是不会亏待我们的。现在的问题是我们能不能下定决心，彻底改造资产阶级立场和世界观，只顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。
    我今年虽然六十五岁了，决心在党的领导、教育下，不但要为社会主义服务到底，还争取为共产主义服务。鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。
