Jiangsu and Anhui are doing everything possible to expand cotton fields; Shandong and Hubei are striving to plant and manage cotton well
Kashgar Prefecture is carrying out the "Hundred Jin of Ginned Cotton per County" campaign; the Hexi Corridor is fighting drought to plant cotton

(Reported by this newspaper) Jiangsu Province has large cotton planting areas, fast progress, and good quality. The province's planned eight million mu of cotton fields have been basically planted, and early-planted cotton seedlings have emerged in rows. A small number of wheat fields that cannot be intercropped are rushing to make nutrient pots for seedling cultivation.

In the spring sowing campaign, Jiangsu has conscientiously implemented the principle of taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements. Various regions have adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, utilizing "ten-side" gaps, rationally adjusting stubble, and rationally adjusting crop layout to expand the planting area of spring-sown grain crops. The province's cotton planting plan has been expanded by 500,000 mu compared with last year, and efforts are being made to exceed this planting plan to provide more support for national industrial raw materials.

Grasping the season is a major feature of this year's cotton planting. The planting period is generally 10 to 15 days earlier than last year. In mid-March, after preparing for spring plowing and harrowing, ditching and ridging, seed treatment, and repairing agricultural tools, various regions began trial planting samples, setting up points at each level. The province established a total of 960,000 mu of cotton sample fields, accounting for 15% of the planting area. Driven by the sample fields, various regions adopted the method of 10 days of preparation, 5 days of intensive work, and 2 days of sweeping up the tail. The province's cotton planting work was basically completed around the Grain Rain solar term, changing the old habit of finishing planting after the Beginning of Summer.

This year's cotton planting is not only fast but also of better quality than in any previous year. It is generally reflected that there are more than ten "mores", namely: more deep plowing of ridges, more small moisture deep ridges, more base fertilizer applied, more area planted with row planters, more wide and narrow row planting, more seedling transplanting, more sugar syrup moth trapping, more tape measures used in the fields, more sample planting, and more contiguous planting. This has laid a good foundation for striving for a sustained leap forward in cotton production this year. (Wang Qingqi)

(Xinhua News Agency, Hefei) Anhui Province had planted 2,040,000 mu of spring cotton by the 21st, an increase of 1,300,000 mu compared with the same period last year. The two key cotton-producing counties of Dangshan and Xiao County have completed their spring cotton planting plans ahead of schedule. In addition, various regions have cultivated 800 million nutrient pots and 2,300 mu of square-cut seedlings to prepare cotton seedlings for wheat stubble fields for timely transplanting to resolve stubble conflicts.

In order to strengthen the leadership of spring cotton planting work, party committees at all levels in the province have specially established a spring cotton planting command, in order to ensure fast and good planting. Party organizations at all levels in Dangshan County have established cotton commands (institutes), and county and commune established eight scientific and technological research institutes. The brigades established 104 scientific research groups to ensure that there are command fields and experimental fields at every level. Using the fields as classrooms, the 70,000-member cotton professional team was given a general training to achieve one technician for every 25 mu of land, one "local expert" for every 100 mu of land, and one cotton-planting expert for every 5 mu of land. The province's cotton professional team was divided into five groups: fertilizer transportation, cultivation, seed treatment, planting, and inspection and acceptance, and the responsibility system of fixed leadership, fixed labor, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed quantity was generally implemented. The county's 350,000 mu of spring cotton was planted in seven days, 10 days earlier than last year.

(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan) Under the slogan of "Striving for initiative by being early, reaping a bumper harvest by planting and managing well," cotton-producing areas in Shandong have intensively planted more than 7,300,000 mu of cotton, accounting for 69.4% of the planned planting area. The Liaocheng area, a major cotton-producing area, has basically completed its cotton planting task.

The cotton that has been planted in the province has met the requirements of reasonable close planting. Generally, about 5,000 jin of base fertilizer is applied per mu, and up to 30,000 jin in some areas. Cotton fields with water conservancy conditions have all been watered before planting. Cotton fields without water conservancy conditions have also generally carried out harrowing and raking to preserve moisture, generally harrowing and raking two to three times, and up to more than ten times in some areas. In the cotton planting work, the province also established more than 12,000 high-yield plots and high-yield fields, covering 53% of all cotton fields.

This year, cotton planting in Shandong was carried out without rain for 100 days. In order to ensure the quality of cotton planting, party committees at all levels established commands, and party committee secretaries at all levels also went to the front line to lead production according to the contracted area. In the main cotton-producing areas, 25,000 cadres from the four counties (cities) of Linqing, Pingyuan, Xiajin, and Dezhou went deep into the production teams to lead commune members in intensive drought-resistant planting, with a daily planting progress of 300,000 mu. In order to ensure full, uniform, and strong seedlings, various regions have increased the amount of sowing, and also generally planted reserve seedlings, generally planting one more row every eight to ten rows for transplanting in case of missing seedlings.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan) The seedling management campaign in cotton fields is rapidly unfolding in Hubei Province. Cotton planting in Hubei Province has now ended one after another, 10 to 15 days earlier than last year. The quality of planting has been greatly improved, generally achieving flat fields, fine soil, straight ditches and compartments, even sowing, and sufficient base fertilizer. Early-planted cotton has now emerged, and some has emerged uniformly. In Tianmen, Jiangling and other counties, 30% to 50% of the cotton fields have emerged, of which about 30% have emerged uniformly.

After the planting was basically completed, various regions quickly grasped the seedling management and launched a cotton field management campaign centered on "three checks" (checking area, checking quality, and checking seedling emergence) and "three guarantees" (guaranteeing seedling survival, guaranteeing full seedlings, and guaranteeing strong seedlings). As soon as cotton planting ended, Huangtan Commune in Tianmen County organized more than 30,000 people for a major inspection. All personnel participating in the inspection did "three brings" (bringing shovels, bringing seeds, bringing baskets), and supplemented while checking. Han Chuan County supplemented 1,350,000 dan of base fertilizer for cotton fields, and all cotton fields with more than 30,000 mu of uncovered seeds were covered with soil. In order to achieve the requirements of "guaranteeing survival, guaranteeing full seedlings, and guaranteeing strong seedlings," various regions have generally established a special person management responsibility system according to fields.

Various regions have closely grasped the rain after cultivating and loosening the soil, clearing ditches and draining waterlogging, and actively done a good job in applying insulation fertilizer, seedling fertilizer, and windbreaks, wind towers, and cold-proof grass dragons for insulation and cold protection. Various regions have also launched a mass movement to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.

(Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) The eleven cotton-planting counties and cities in Kashgar Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area in southern Xinjiang, are vigorously carrying out a production competition campaign of "Hundred Jin of Ginned Cotton per County", "Double Hundred Jin of Ginned Cotton per Commune", and "Thousand Jin of Seed Cotton per Team", doing everything possible to ensure the planting area, ensuring high-standard planting quality, ensuring full seedlings per mu, and realizing this year's cotton bumper harvest plan. As of the 22nd, the prefecture had planted 760,000 mu, and the planting quality surpassed last year.

Kashgar Prefecture has focused on planting quality this year, and cotton fields have been meticulously leveled before planting. More than 80% of the 800,000 mu of cotton fields in the prefecture have been turned into gardens, achieving flat land, fine soil, and good moisture retention. More than 90% of the cotton fields in Makit County have been turned into gardens. This year, most of the cotton fields are concentrated in continuous areas. Before planting, generally more than 7,000 jin of high-quality base fertilizer was applied per mu, and in Bachu County, 15,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu. All cotton seeds are "108-F" improved varieties. Before planting, all seeds were mixed with "666" and "Ceresan", and measures such as shoveling, luring, killing, and exterminating were taken to eliminate cutworms that harm cotton seedlings.

(Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou) The drought-resistant cotton planting campaign in the Hexi Corridor, a major cotton-producing area in Gansu, has been launched. The communes and production teams in Anxi County have focused on high-yield cotton plots and the promotion of advanced cotton planting technology, and the planting work is fast and good. Dunhuang County has summarized and promoted the experience of early planting in winter water fields, and cotton planting in winter water fields has started ahead of schedule. Currently, more than 3,000 mu have been planted in the county.

While ensuring a large increase in grain production this year, the Hexi Corridor has decided to expand the cotton planting area from 410,000 mu of actual harvest last year to 560,000 mu. In order to ensure the completion of this task, the leading organs in this area, the Zhangye Prefectural Commissioner's Office, established a Cotton Planting Bureau, and the counties and cities also established Cotton Planting Bureaus to strengthen specific leadership. Therefore, the cotton preparation work has been done fully and solidly. The 560,000 mu of cotton land in the area has been deeply plowed, harrowed, and compacted last autumn, and the soil is generally moist and sufficient. Each mu has 12,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer. Most of the land has been irrigated in winter and spring. The seeds have been selected and mixed, the sowing machines have been inspected, repaired, and supplemented, and more than 4,600 sowing technicians have been trained.

    江苏安徽千方百计扩大棉田  山东湖北力争棉花种足管好
    喀什专区开展　“百斤皮棉县”运动　河西走廊抗旱种棉
    本报讯　江苏省各地棉花播种面积大、进度快、质量好。全省计划播种的八百万亩棉田，已基本播种结束，早播棉苗已出土成行。少数不能套种的麦田，正在突击赶做营养钵育苗。
    江苏各地在春播运动中，认真贯彻了以粮为纲，全面安排的方针。各地采取开垦荒地、利用“十边”隙地、合理调整茬口和合理调整作物布局等办法，在扩大春播粮食作物面积的基础上，全省棉花播种计划比去年扩大五十万亩，并尽力超过这一种植计划，更多地支援国家工业原料。
    狠抓季节是今年棉花播种的一大特点，播种期一般比去年提早十天到半个月。3月中旬，各地在提前做好春耕春耙、开沟筑畦、种子处理和检修农具等工作后，就开始试播放样，层层设点，全省共搞棉花样子田九十六万亩，占播种面积15％。在样子田的带动下，各地采取十天准备，五天突击，两天扫尽尾的办法，全省棉花播种工作在谷雨左右就基本结束，改变了过去立夏以后才种完的老习惯。
    今年棉花播种不仅进度快，而且质量也比以往任何一年好，普遍反映有十多，即：条垅深翻多、小墒深垅多，基肥施得多，用条播机播种面积多，宽窄行种植多，育苗移栽多，糖浆诱蛾多，带尺下田多，放样试种多，连片种植多。这就为争取今年棉花持续跃进奠定了良好基础。　（王庆其）
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省到21日止已播种春棉二百零四万亩，比去年同期多种了一百三十万亩。砀山、萧县两个重点产棉县，春棉播种计划已提前完成。此外，各地还培育营养钵八亿个、方块育苗二千三百亩，为麦茬棉田准备棉苗，以便及时移栽，解决茬口矛盾。
    全省各级党委为了加强春棉播种工作的领导，专门成立了棉花春种指挥部，以保证种快种好。砀山县各级党组织分别建立了棉花指挥部（所），县、社建立了八所科学技术研究所，大队建立了一百零四个科学研究组，做到层层有指挥田、试验田，并以田间为课堂，将七万人的棉花专业队普训一次，达到二十五亩地有一个技术员，一百亩地有一个“土专家”，五亩地有一个植棉能手。全省棉花专业队分成运肥、耕作、种子处理、播种、检查验收等五套班子，普遍推行了定领导、定劳力、定时间、定质量、定数量的责任制。全县三十五万亩春棉在七天内便播种完毕，比去年提早十天完成。
    据新华社济南讯　山东各产棉区在“一早百早争主动，种足种好夺丰收”的口号下，已突击播种棉花七百三十多万亩，占计划播种面积的69.4％，盛产棉花的聊城专区棉花播种任务已基本结束。
    全省已播种的棉花，都达到了合理密植的要求，一般每亩施基肥五千斤左右，多的达三万斤；有水利条件的棉田都浇了播前水，无水利条件的棉田，也都普遍进行了耙、耢保墒工作，一般耙耢二至三次，多的有十多次。全省在棉花播种工作中，还建立了一万二千多个丰产方和高额丰产田，面积占全部棉田的53％。
    今年，山东棉花播种是在百日无雨的情况下进行的。为了保证棉花播种质量，各级党委都建立了指挥部，各级党委书记也都亲临前线，按方包干，领导生产。主要产棉区的临清、平原、夏津、德州等四个县（市），有两万五千名干部深入生产队带领社员突击抗旱播种，播种日进度达三十万亩。为保证苗全苗齐苗旺，各地除加大播种量之外，同时还普遍播种了预备苗，一般每八至十行多播一行，以备缺苗时移栽。
    据新华社武汉讯　棉田苗期管理运动正在湖北省迅速展开。湖北省棉花播种现已陆续结束，比去年提早十天到半个月。播种质量大为提高，一般达到了田平、土碎、沟厢直，播种匀，底肥足。早播的目前已经出苗，部分已经齐苗。天门、江陵等县有30％到50％的棉田已经出苗，其中齐苗的占30％左右。
    播种基本结束后，各地迅速抓住苗期管理，开展了“三查”（查面积、查质量、查出苗情况）、“三保”（保生苗、保全苗、保壮苗）为中心的棉田管理运动。天门县黄潭公社在棉花播种一结束，即组织三万多人进行大检查。参加检查的人员全都作到“三带”（带铲子、带种子、带篓子），边查就边补。汉川县棉田补施底肥一百三十五万担，三万多亩盖籽不严的棉田全部盖上了土，为了达到“保生、保全、保壮”的要求，各地普遍按田块建立了专人管理责任制。
    各地都紧紧抓住了雨后中耕松土，清沟排渍，积极作好施保温肥、提苗肥和防风障、防风塔、防寒草龙等保温防寒工作。各地还开展了防治病虫害的群众性运动。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆南部主要产棉区——喀什专区十一个植棉县、市正轰轰烈烈地开展“百斤皮棉县”、“双百斤皮棉社”、“千斤籽棉队”的超产竞赛运动，千方百计保播种面积、保高标准的播种质量，保亩亩全苗，实现今年棉花丰产计划。到22日止，全专区已播种七十六万亩，播种质量超过去年。
    喀什专区今年狠抓播种质量，棉田在播种前都进行了细致的平整。全专区八十万亩棉田有80％以上实现了园田化，做到地平、土细、保墒好。麦盖提县90％以上的棉田实现了园田化。今年棉田大都是集中成片。播种前，一般每亩施了七千斤以上的优质底肥，巴楚县棉田每亩施底肥达一万五千斤。棉种全部为“一零八夫”良种。在播种前，全部用“六六六”、“赛力散”拌种，并且采取铲、诱、杀、灭等防治办法消灭为害棉苗的地老虎。
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃主要产棉区——河西走廊抗旱种棉运动已经展开。安西县各公社和生产队，大抓棉花丰产方和推广先进植棉技术，播种工作又快又好。敦煌县总结和推广了冬水地早播种的经验，冬水地棉花播种已提前开始，目前全县已种了三千多亩。
    河西走廊今年在保证粮食大量增产的同时，棉花播种面积决定由去年实收的四十一万亩扩大到五十六万亩。为了保证完成这个任务，这个地区的领导机关张掖专署成立了植棉局，各县、市也成立了植棉局，加强了具体领导。因此，棉花备耕工作做得充分和扎实。全区五十六万亩棉地，经过去年秋耕深翻和耙压整理，普遍土绵墒足，每亩有底肥一万二千斤到一万五千斤，大部土地进行了冬春灌溉，种子都经过选拌，播种机具都已检查补修，并训练了四千六百多名播种技术人员。
