Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Mr. Furato, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Polish People's Republic in China, held a banquet tonight for the visit of the Polish military delegation headed by General Bozyczkowski to our country.

    Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Luo Ruiqing, was invited to attend the banquet.

    At the beginning of the banquet, General Bozyczkowski, head of the Polish military delegation, said in his speech that the delegation had visited many cities, factories, rural people's communes, military academies, and troops in China, and had seen how the militia organization combined production tasks with defending national defense, and how the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army directly participated in the country's socialist construction, with a strong and unbreakable connection between the army and the people.

    General Bozyczkowski said that although we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, common thoughts and common goals closely link us together in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace on the two most advanced fronts of the great socialist camp. In this struggle, the powerful strength of our strong ally and friend, the Soviet Union, is recognized even by the most insane enemies. We are united in the great socialist camp, full of confidence in victory, because we have immortal and invincible Marxism-Leninism.

    General Luo Ruiqing, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressed his gratitude to the dear Polish comrades. He said that the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union is now stronger than ever. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, the hardworking Polish people are constantly making new developments in industrial and agricultural construction, showing the bright and brilliant prospects of the Polish People's Republic.

    General Luo Ruiqing said that the fraternal armies of our socialist camp countries, with the rapid development of socialist construction, have greatly strengthened their combat power and have become the pillar for defending their own countries and safeguarding world peace. The strong unity of the socialist camp is a reliable guarantee for stopping all aggressive activities and war conspiracies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. Any war conspiracy of imperialism will surely meet with a shameful defeat. Our open and aboveboard socialist cause and the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism will always shine like the sun.

    During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently toasted to the profound friendship between the Chinese and Polish people and armies.

    Attending tonight's banquet were also senior generals of the People's Liberation Army including General Wang Shusheng, General Xiao Hua, General Gan Siqi, General Peng Shaohui, General Yang Yong, General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Qiu Huizuo, Lieutenant General Liu Daosheng of the Navy, and Lieutenant General Tan Jiasu of the Air Force.

    Also present at the banquet was Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    波兰大使馆举行宴会
    罗瑞卿大将出席，宾主频频为两国友谊举杯祝贺
    新华社29日讯　波兰人民共和国驻华大使馆临时代办傅拉托，今晚为以博齐沃夫斯基上将为首的波兰军事代表团访问我国举行宴会。
    国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会开始，波兰军事代表团团长博齐沃夫斯基上将讲话说，代表团在中国参观了许多城市、工厂、城乡人民公社、军事院校和部队，看到了民兵组织把生产任务与保卫国防结合了起来，看到了中国人民解放军官兵直接参加国家的社会主义建设，军队与人民之间有着坚强的牢不可破的联系。
    博齐沃夫斯基上将说，虽然我们之间相隔千山万水，但是，共同的思想、共同的目标，在伟大的社会主义阵营的两个最前沿共同反对帝国主义、保卫和平的斗争中，把我们牢固地联结在一起。在这个斗争中，我们强大的同盟者和朋友——苏联的强大威力，甚至连最疯狂的敌人也不得不承认。我们团结在伟大的社会主义阵营中，对胜利充满信心，因为我们有不朽的、战无不胜的马列主义。
    罗瑞卿大将代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向亲爱的波兰战友们表示感谢。他说，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营现在比过去更加强大。勤劳的波兰人民，在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党的领导下，在工业和农业建设方面不断获得新的发展。展现出波兰人民共和国光辉灿烂的前景。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我们社会主义阵营各国的兄弟军队，随着社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，大大地加强了战斗威力，已经成为保卫自己祖国和捍卫世界和平的支柱。社会主义阵营的强大团结，是制止以美国为首的帝国主义集团的一切侵略活动和战争阴谋的可靠保证。帝国主义的任何战争阴谋，必将遭到可耻的失败。我们光明磊落的社会主义事业和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，永远像太阳一样，光芒四射。
    宴会席间，宾主频频为中波人民和军队之间的深厚友谊举杯祝贺。
    出席今晚宴会的有王树声大将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、彭绍辉上将、杨勇上将、李聚奎上将、丘会作中将、刘道生海军中将、谭家述空军中将等人民解放军高级将领。
