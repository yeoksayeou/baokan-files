Comrades and Representatives:
We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
The reports of the two Vice Premiers not only correctly summarized the brilliant achievements of the continued Great Leap Forward last year, but also pointed out the magnificent prospects for the continued Great Leap Forward this year. We are deeply encouraged by the great victories achieved in our country's socialist construction and the grand plan for the continued Great Leap Forward, and we must strive to realize the continued leap forward in the national economy.
Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities in the Yunnan border area, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, together with the people of the whole country, achieved the victory of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. The border ethnic areas, which were politically, economically, and culturally very backward areas only ten years ago, were in various stages of development from primitive communes to early feudal societies. Under the oppression of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the people of all nationalities struggled in poverty and misery. Only after liberation, after ten years, especially after the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the people of all nationalities in the border area have crossed one or even several stages of social development, leaping over thousands of years of historical process, and entered a new historical stage of socialism, greatly changing the backwardness of the border area. This is the victory of the Party's nationality policy and the great victory of the three magic weapons. This victory powerfully shows that Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of China's revolution and construction, is invincible.
The socialist road is the only bright road for the common prosperity of all nationalities. The process of transitioning to socialism is also the process by which all nationalities completely get rid of poverty and backwardness and move towards common prosperity and development. The "poor and blank" situation in the border ethnic areas is even more significant, and the desire of the people of all nationalities to rapidly change the backward situation is even stronger. After the democratic reform, the continuous development of productive forces has put forward the requirements for changing production relations. In the past two years, under the guidance of the General Line and encouraged by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the people of all nationalities in the border area have burst out with an irrepressible revolutionary spirit of seeking change out of poverty, and are impatiently demanding the most rapid development of production. The individual economy has become increasingly incompatible with the great development of production, hindering the people from realizing their grand plans. In many places, the masses have spontaneously set up cooperatives and even people's communes. The Henan People's Commune of the Kawa ethnic group with more than 300 households in Kawa Mountain was established in this way. In the spring of 1958, the light of the General Line illuminated the direction of their progress, and the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward inspired their fighting spirit to be even more high-spirited. They wanted to build large-scale water conservancy projects, open up large areas of paddy fields, set up factories, develop economic crops, and also build power stations and run schools. Agricultural production cooperatives were weak and could not do these things, so they merged ten agricultural cooperatives into a large commune integrating government and commune. After the publication of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on Establishing People's Communes in Rural Areas," it was officially called the People's Commune. In the first year of the commune's establishment, agriculture, industry, culture, education, and health all achieved comprehensive and great development, and the lives of the commune members were greatly improved. Driven by the development of production and the urgent demands of the masses, the border ethnic areas of Yunnan realized cooperativization three years ahead of schedule, and established 6,673 cooperatives. In some areas with a better foundation, joint cooperatives and people's communes were established, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives accounted for more than 90% of the total number of farmer households. These cooperatives and people's communes were established in different ways and steps according to the characteristics of the border area and the characteristics of the nationalities, in order to facilitate the development of production, unite the majority of the people, and consolidate the defense of the motherland. In terms of the handling of means of production, accumulation ratio, distribution policy, and business management, different methods were adopted respectively. In this way, the cooperatives and people's communes were made more suitable for the production level and the level of consciousness of the masses in the border ethnic areas, so that the masses had a gradual process of getting used to it, and the transition from individual production to collective production and from individual economy to collective economy was relatively natural. It also allowed the upper-class ethnic people to think about this great change more calmly.

The cooperatives and people's communes established in this way, after adjustments, have become increasingly consolidated, showing unparalleled superiority and vigorous vitality, further liberating productive forces, and playing a decisive role in promoting the economic and cultural development of the border ethnic areas. On the basis of the unprecedented bumper harvest of grain in 1958, it increased by more than 15% in 1959. In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, grain production has quadrupled in the past ten years. The Nuowu Xiazhai Cooperative, composed of the Lahu and Kawa ethnic groups in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, has even faster growth in grain production. Before liberation, the average annual income of grain per person was less than 100 catties, and they were hungry as soon as the sickle stopped. After liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the government, production developed year by year. In 1957, the average grain per person was 255 catties. In 1958, the cooperative was established, and the grain increased sharply to an average of 1,100 catties per person. In 1959, the Great Leap Forward continued, reaching an average of 2,497 catties of grain per person, and an average of 2,593 catties of surplus grain were sold to the state per household. Not only did grain production increase greatly, but the output of economic crops also increased significantly. The "Pu'er tea" produced in Xishuangbanna produced more than 4.2 million catties in 1958 and increased to more than 5.8 million catties in 1959. Sugarcane and cotton have also increased significantly, and tropical and subtropical crops such as coffee, aromatic oil, tannin extract, and camphor have also been developed in large quantities. The border area was originally a region with basically no industry. More than 3,000 factories and mines were established in 1958, ending the history of no industry for various ethnic groups in the border area. In 1959, industry blossomed everywhere, and almost all cooperatives and people's communes established factories of varying sizes, and the technical level was significantly improved. The Jingde Factory in Xishuangbanna could only brew wine and squeeze oil when it was first established in 1954. Now it is an agricultural machinery factory capable of producing rice milling machines, electric motors, blowers, and machine tools. In terms of transportation, the previously closed situation where cars could not pass and horses could hardly travel has been greatly changed. Except for individual counties, all are connected by highways. Culture, education, and health undertakings are also making great leaps forward. The number of primary school enrollments has reached 66% of school-age children, and the number of secondary school enrollments has increased by 48% compared with 1958. The development of health undertakings has changed the face of the "miasma area," basically curbing the spread of plague and malignant malaria, and sending away the two major plague gods in the border area. The development of production and culture, education, and health has shown the improvement of the material and cultural life of the people of all nationalities. Not only have the vast majority of people increased their income, and about half of the members have joined public canteens, but also cultural troupes, film teams, and excellent national literary and artistic creations have also developed greatly. Compared with the original backwardness of the various ethnic groups, it is a truly earth-shaking change.

The development of the economic base inevitably promoted the changes in the superstructure and promoted the changes in the ideological situation and spiritual outlook of the people of all nationalities. In collective production, many superstitions of worshiping gods and ghosts were automatically broken, and many old conventions and bad habits that hindered production were abolished. On this basis, the excellent traditions of the nation were further promoted. The national inferiority complex caused by long-term national oppression is gradually being eliminated. In the past, they thought that "we cannot do the advanced production methods of the Han people." Now they say, "What the Han elder brothers can do, we can definitely do." In the past, winter fields were not plowed. Now, not only winter fields are plowed, but they are plowed very seriously. In the past, it was thought that fertilized crops would smell bad. Now, not only is fertilizer applied, but also large amounts of human and animal manure are applied. In the past, it was thought that if women plowed the fields, there would be drought, thunder, plague, broken mountains, and crying cattle. Now, women plowing the fields has not only become a common phenomenon, but also many women plowing experts have emerged. Production technology has gradually improved, production has developed greatly, and ideology has been continuously liberated. They have learned to use new agricultural tools, and tool reforms have also been carried out vigorously. The Hani People's Commune in Nannuo Mountain is a place famous for producing tea. In the past, they only picked tea and sold fresh leaves. In 1958, the commune was established, and they learned to make tea. Every production team set up a black tea primary processing factory. In 1959, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched. The number of managers in each factory was reduced from three to four to one to two. After two years of continuous leap forward, the ranks of ethnic cadres have also grown rapidly, and the socialist consciousness of the masses has been significantly improved. They have received certain training in practice and have emerged as a large number of activists who have become the backbone of the people of all nationalities to liberate themselves along the socialist road. The upper-class ethnic people have been properly arranged and taken care of in terms of politics and life. After patriotic and socialist education and a series of movements, they have seen the thriving socialist construction of the motherland and the rapid economic and cultural development of the border area. The backward situation of their own nation is rapidly changing, and their ideology has also been improved to varying degrees. Most of them have given up exploitation, are willing to lean towards the Party, and support socialism. All forces that can be united have been further united under the banner of socialism, forming a huge force for socialist transformation and construction in the border area. The struggle against the conspiracies of imperialism and enemy agents has continuously achieved new victories. All acts that harm the cause of socialism and the unity of the motherland will inevitably be opposed by the people of all nationalities and will be isolated. The people of all nationalities have realized the benefits of being organized from their own experience. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The determination to follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao, and take the socialist road has become more firm.
The view that one-sidedly emphasizes backwardness and special circumstances and believes that ethnic areas cannot develop production at high speed and cannot leap forward is untenable in the face of the facts of two years of continuous great leap forward. This past winter and spring, the border area has built water conservancy projects with an irrigation area of 600,000 mu, reclaimed more than 2 million mu of new land, and prepared for farming earlier and better than in previous years. Most areas completed the task of plowing winter fields before the Spring Festival. Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and vigorously developing economic crops are forming a climax. This year's continuous leap forward in the border area has had an encouraging start.

Although the various ethnic groups in the border area have achieved tremendous achievements in the continuous leap forward in the past two years, they have not fundamentally changed the poor and backward situation and need to continue to stride forward. Continue to strengthen socialist education, continuously improve the consciousness of the people of all nationalities, maintain high vigilance, smash the destructive conspiracies of imperialism and enemy agents, and, with the help of the Han people, make full use of all favorable conditions to achieve the continued leap forward in production this year. Accelerate the pace, develop the economy and culture, catch up with the level of advanced nations, and strive to join the ranks of advanced nations as soon as possible.

The Yunnan border area is a beautiful and rich place of the motherland, with vast and fertile land, abundant rainfall, and a warm climate, suitable for the growth of tropical and subtropical economic crops. Many rich resources are waiting to be developed to serve the socialist construction of the motherland. However, because the border area is vast and sparsely populated, coupled with limited material resources, financial resources, and technical level, it must rely on the great strength of the motherland and the vigorous and comprehensive support of the advanced nations in the interior, especially the Han people, in order to fully exploit the resources of the border area. Recently, a group of young people from the hometown of our respected leader Chairman Mao, from all our ethnic groups, have come to the Yunnan border area to participate in construction. They have brought the care of the Party and Chairman Mao to us, brought the example of the communist heroic spirit of the old revolutionary base area, and also brought the advanced production technology and advanced culture and art of the Han elder brothers, which has played a great role in strengthening national unity and promoting the development of socialist construction in the border area, and has therefore been warmly welcomed by the people of all nationalities in the Yunnan border area. In order to rapidly develop the socialist construction in the border area of the motherland, and for the common interests of the people of all nationalities, we warmly welcome more compatriots from the interior to continue to support us.

Just as our people of all nationalities are united under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to jointly build the great family of the motherland, we have heard that overseas Chinese in Indonesia are being persecuted there. We are very sympathetic and concerned about them. Recently, our government has sent ships to pick up those persecuted, displaced, and willing to return to the embrace of the motherland. We also warmly welcome them to come to the Yunnan border area and join us in building the great family of our great motherland.
Yunnan is the southwest border of the motherland, connected to our friendly neighbor Myanmar by mountains and rivers, with villages facing each other. It has a major task in enhancing the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar. In the years since liberation, the people of all nationalities in the border area have been following the teachings of the Party and developing the traditional friendship between us and the people of Myanmar in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government, representing the wishes and interests of the people of the whole country, signed the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the agreement between the two countries on border issues with the Myanmar government, which brought the development of Sino-Myanmar friendly relations into a new stage, paving the way for the comprehensive solution of the complex border issues left over by imperialism, and will bring many benefits to the construction of both countries and the happiness of the people. The people of all nationalities in the border area are very happy about this, and we firmly support this treaty and will continue to work hard to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar and actively assist the government in finally and comprehensively resolving the border issues.

We already have a magnificent picture of the continued leap forward in 1960. The east wind of the continued leap forward has blown all over the motherland and has reached the Yunnan border area. Brilliant achievements, victorious situations, and bright prospects encourage us to continue to leap forward. Adhering to the leadership of the Party, holding high the great banner of the three magic weapons, and united in the unified family of the motherland, we must make greater efforts to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, continue to improve our thinking, contribute our strength to socialist construction, and strive to achieve the continued leap forward this year in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and build the socialist border area of the motherland.
