Comrades and Representatives:
We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
The reports of the two Vice Premiers not only correctly summarized the brilliant achievements of the continued Great Leap Forward last year, but also pointed out the magnificent prospects for the continued Great Leap Forward this year. We are deeply encouraged by the great victories achieved in our country's socialist construction and the grand plan for the continued Great Leap Forward, and we must strive to realize the continued leap forward in the national economy.
Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities in the Yunnan border area, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, together with the people of the whole country, achieved the victory of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. The border ethnic areas, which were politically, economically, and culturally very backward areas only ten years ago, were in various stages of development from primitive communes to early feudal societies. Under the oppression of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the people of all nationalities struggled in poverty and misery. Only after liberation, after ten years, especially after the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the people of all nationalities in the border area have crossed one or even several stages of social development, leaping over thousands of years of historical process, and entered a new historical stage of socialism, greatly changing the backwardness of the border area. This is the victory of the Party's nationality policy and the great victory of the three magic weapons. This victory powerfully shows that Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of China's revolution and construction, is invincible.
The socialist road is the only bright road for the common prosperity of all nationalities. The process of transitioning to socialism is also the process by which all nationalities completely get rid of poverty and backwardness and move towards common prosperity and development. The "poor and blank" situation in the border ethnic areas is even more significant, and the desire of the people of all nationalities to rapidly change the backward situation is even stronger. After the democratic reform, the continuous development of productive forces has put forward the requirements for changing production relations. In the past two years, under the guidance of the General Line and encouraged by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the people of all nationalities in the border area have burst out with an irrepressible revolutionary spirit of seeking change out of poverty, and are impatiently demanding the most rapid development of production. The individual economy has become increasingly incompatible with the great development of production, hindering the people from realizing their grand plans. In many places, the masses have spontaneously set up cooperatives and even people's communes. The Henan People's Commune of the Kawa ethnic group with more than 300 households in Kawa Mountain was established in this way. In the spring of 1958, the light of the General Line illuminated the direction of their progress, and the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward inspired their fighting spirit to be even more high-spirited. They wanted to build large-scale water conservancy projects, open up large areas of paddy fields, set up factories, develop economic crops, and also build power stations and run schools. Agricultural production cooperatives were weak and could not do these things, so they merged ten agricultural cooperatives into a large commune integrating government and commune. After the publication of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on Establishing People's Communes in Rural Areas," it was officially called the People's Commune. In the first year of the commune's establishment, agriculture, industry, culture, education, and health all achieved comprehensive and great development, and the lives of the commune members were greatly improved. Driven by the development of production and the urgent demands of the masses, the border ethnic areas of Yunnan realized cooperativization three years ahead of schedule, and established 6,673 cooperatives. In some areas with a better foundation, joint cooperatives and people's communes were established, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives accounted for more than 90% of the total number of farmer households. These cooperatives and people's communes were established in different ways and steps according to the characteristics of the border area and the characteristics of the nationalities, in order to facilitate the development of production, unite the majority of the people, and consolidate the defense of the motherland. In terms of the handling of means of production, accumulation ratio, distribution policy, and business management, different methods were adopted respectively. In this way, the cooperatives and people's communes were made more suitable for the production level and the level of consciousness of the masses in the border ethnic areas, so that the masses had a gradual process of getting used to it, and the transition from individual production to collective production and from individual economy to collective economy was relatively natural. It also allowed the upper-class ethnic people to think about this great change more calmly.

The cooperatives and people's communes established in this way, after adjustments, have become increasingly consolidated, showing unparalleled superiority and vigorous vitality, further liberating productive forces, and playing a decisive role in promoting the economic and cultural development of the border ethnic areas. On the basis of the unprecedented bumper harvest of grain in 1958, it increased by more than 15% in 1959. In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, grain production has quadrupled in the past ten years. The Nuowu Xiazhai Cooperative, composed of the Lahu and Kawa ethnic groups in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, has even faster growth in grain production. Before liberation, the average annual income of grain per person was less than 100 catties, and they were hungry as soon as the sickle stopped. After liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the government, production developed year by year. In 1957, the average grain per person was 255 catties. In 1958, the cooperative was established, and the grain increased sharply to an average of 1,100 catties per person. In 1959, the Great Leap Forward continued, reaching an average of 2,497 catties of grain per person, and an average of 2,593 catties of surplus grain were sold to the state per household. Not only did grain production increase greatly, but the output of economic crops also increased significantly. The "Pu'er tea" produced in Xishuangbanna produced more than 4.2 million catties in 1958 and increased to more than 5.8 million catties in 1959. Sugarcane and cotton have also increased significantly, and tropical and subtropical crops such as coffee, aromatic oil, tannin extract, and camphor have also been developed in large quantities. The border area was originally a region with basically no industry. More than 3,000 factories and mines were established in 1958, ending the history of no industry for various ethnic groups in the border area. In 1959, industry blossomed everywhere, and almost all cooperatives and people's communes established factories of varying sizes, and the technical level was significantly improved. The Jingde Factory in Xishuangbanna could only brew wine and squeeze oil when it was first established in 1954. Now it is an agricultural machinery factory capable of producing rice milling machines, electric motors, blowers, and machine tools. In terms of transportation, the previously closed situation where cars could not pass and horses could hardly travel has been greatly changed. Except for individual counties, all are connected by highways. Culture, education, and health undertakings are also making great leaps forward. The number of primary school enrollments has reached 66% of school-age children, and the number of secondary school enrollments has increased by 48% compared with 1958. The development of health undertakings has changed the face of the "miasma area," basically curbing the spread of plague and malignant malaria, and sending away the two major plague gods in the border area. The development of production and culture, education, and health has shown the improvement of the material and cultural life of the people of all nationalities. Not only have the vast majority of people increased their income, and about half of the members have joined public canteens, but also cultural troupes, film teams, and excellent national literary and artistic creations have also developed greatly. Compared with the original backwardness of the various ethnic groups, it is a truly earth-shaking change.

The development of the economic base inevitably promoted the changes in the superstructure and promoted the changes in the ideological situation and spiritual outlook of the people of all nationalities. In collective production, many superstitions of worshiping gods and ghosts were automatically broken, and many old conventions and bad habits that hindered production were abolished. On this basis, the excellent traditions of the nation were further promoted. The national inferiority complex caused by long-term national oppression is gradually being eliminated. In the past, they thought that "we cannot do the advanced production methods of the Han people." Now they say, "What the Han elder brothers can do, we can definitely do." In the past, winter fields were not plowed. Now, not only winter fields are plowed, but they are plowed very seriously. In the past, it was thought that fertilized crops would smell bad. Now, not only is fertilizer applied, but also large amounts of human and animal manure are applied. In the past, it was thought that if women plowed the fields, there would be drought, thunder, plague, broken mountains, and crying cattle. Now, women plowing the fields has not only become a common phenomenon, but also many women plowing experts have emerged. Production technology has gradually improved, production has developed greatly, and ideology has been continuously liberated. They have learned to use new agricultural tools, and tool reforms have also been carried out vigorously. The Hani People's Commune in Nannuo Mountain is a place famous for producing tea. In the past, they only picked tea and sold fresh leaves. In 1958, the commune was established, and they learned to make tea. Every production team set up a black tea primary processing factory. In 1959, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched. The number of managers in each factory was reduced from three to four to one to two. After two years of continuous leap forward, the ranks of ethnic cadres have also grown rapidly, and the socialist consciousness of the masses has been significantly improved. They have received certain training in practice and have emerged as a large number of activists who have become the backbone of the people of all nationalities to liberate themselves along the socialist road. The upper-class ethnic people have been properly arranged and taken care of in terms of politics and life. After patriotic and socialist education and a series of movements, they have seen the thriving socialist construction of the motherland and the rapid economic and cultural development of the border area. The backward situation of their own nation is rapidly changing, and their ideology has also been improved to varying degrees. Most of them have given up exploitation, are willing to lean towards the Party, and support socialism. All forces that can be united have been further united under the banner of socialism, forming a huge force for socialist transformation and construction in the border area. The struggle against the conspiracies of imperialism and enemy agents has continuously achieved new victories. All acts that harm the cause of socialism and the unity of the motherland will inevitably be opposed by the people of all nationalities and will be isolated. The people of all nationalities have realized the benefits of being organized from their own experience. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The determination to follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao, and take the socialist road has become more firm.
The view that one-sidedly emphasizes backwardness and special circumstances and believes that ethnic areas cannot develop production at high speed and cannot leap forward is untenable in the face of the facts of two years of continuous great leap forward. This past winter and spring, the border area has built water conservancy projects with an irrigation area of 600,000 mu, reclaimed more than 2 million mu of new land, and prepared for farming earlier and better than in previous years. Most areas completed the task of plowing winter fields before the Spring Festival. Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and vigorously developing economic crops are forming a climax. This year's continuous leap forward in the border area has had an encouraging start.

Although the various ethnic groups in the border area have achieved tremendous achievements in the continuous leap forward in the past two years, they have not fundamentally changed the poor and backward situation and need to continue to stride forward. Continue to strengthen socialist education, continuously improve the consciousness of the people of all nationalities, maintain high vigilance, smash the destructive conspiracies of imperialism and enemy agents, and, with the help of the Han people, make full use of all favorable conditions to achieve the continued leap forward in production this year. Accelerate the pace, develop the economy and culture, catch up with the level of advanced nations, and strive to join the ranks of advanced nations as soon as possible.

The Yunnan border area is a beautiful and rich place of the motherland, with vast and fertile land, abundant rainfall, and a warm climate, suitable for the growth of tropical and subtropical economic crops. Many rich resources are waiting to be developed to serve the socialist construction of the motherland. However, because the border area is vast and sparsely populated, coupled with limited material resources, financial resources, and technical level, it must rely on the great strength of the motherland and the vigorous and comprehensive support of the advanced nations in the interior, especially the Han people, in order to fully exploit the resources of the border area. Recently, a group of young people from the hometown of our respected leader Chairman Mao, from all our ethnic groups, have come to the Yunnan border area to participate in construction. They have brought the care of the Party and Chairman Mao to us, brought the example of the communist heroic spirit of the old revolutionary base area, and also brought the advanced production technology and advanced culture and art of the Han elder brothers, which has played a great role in strengthening national unity and promoting the development of socialist construction in the border area, and has therefore been warmly welcomed by the people of all nationalities in the Yunnan border area. In order to rapidly develop the socialist construction in the border area of the motherland, and for the common interests of the people of all nationalities, we warmly welcome more compatriots from the interior to continue to support us.

Just as our people of all nationalities are united under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to jointly build the great family of the motherland, we have heard that overseas Chinese in Indonesia are being persecuted there. We are very sympathetic and concerned about them. Recently, our government has sent ships to pick up those persecuted, displaced, and willing to return to the embrace of the motherland. We also warmly welcome them to come to the Yunnan border area and join us in building the great family of our great motherland.
Yunnan is the southwest border of the motherland, connected to our friendly neighbor Myanmar by mountains and rivers, with villages facing each other. It has a major task in enhancing the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar. In the years since liberation, the people of all nationalities in the border area have been following the teachings of the Party and developing the traditional friendship between us and the people of Myanmar in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government, representing the wishes and interests of the people of the whole country, signed the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the agreement between the two countries on border issues with the Myanmar government, which brought the development of Sino-Myanmar friendly relations into a new stage, paving the way for the comprehensive solution of the complex border issues left over by imperialism, and will bring many benefits to the construction of both countries and the happiness of the people. The people of all nationalities in the border area are very happy about this, and we firmly support this treaty and will continue to work hard to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar and actively assist the government in finally and comprehensively resolving the border issues.

We already have a magnificent picture of the continued leap forward in 1960. The east wind of the continued leap forward has blown all over the motherland and has reached the Yunnan border area. Brilliant achievements, victorious situations, and bright prospects encourage us to continue to leap forward. Adhering to the leadership of the Party, holding high the great banner of the three magic weapons, and united in the unified family of the motherland, we must make greater efforts to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, continue to improve our thinking, contribute our strength to socialist construction, and strive to achieve the continued leap forward this year in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and build the socialist border area of the motherland.

    我们完全同意和衷心拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    两位副总理的报告，不仅正确地总结了去年继续大跃进的光辉成就，而且指出了今年继续大跃进的壮丽前景。我们深为我国社会主义建设所取得的伟大胜利和继续大跃进的宏伟计划所鼓舞，一定要为实现国民经济的继续跃进而奋斗。
    云南边疆各族人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，和全国人民一道，在1958年和1959年，取得了连续大跃进的胜利。边疆民族地区，十年前还是政治、经济和文化都十分落后的地区，处在从原始公社到初期封建社会的各个发展阶段，在帝国主义及国民党反动统治的压迫和阶级剥削下，各族人民挣扎在贫困和悲惨的生活里。解放后，才经过十年的时间，特别是经过两年来的连续大跃进，边疆各族人民越过了一个甚至几个社会发展阶段，飞越了千百年的历史过程，迈入了社会主义的历史新阶段，极大地改变了边疆的落后面貌。这是党的民族政策的胜利，是三大法宝的伟大胜利。这个胜利有力地说明：马克思列宁主义与我国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，是无往而不胜的。
    社会主义道路是各族人民共同繁荣的唯一光明大道，向社会主义过渡的过程，也就是各族人民彻底摆脱贫困落后走向共同繁荣发展的过程。边疆民族地区“一穷二白”的状况更加显著，各族人民要求迅速改变落后状况的愿望更加强烈。经过民主改革，生产力的不断发展，提出了变革生产关系的要求。两年来，在总路线的指引和全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，边疆各族人民迸发出不可抑制的穷则思变的革命干劲，迫不及待地要求最迅速地发展生产。个体经济在生产大发展中已愈来愈显得不相适应，有碍人民群众大展宏图，许多地方的群众就自动办起了合作社，甚至办起了人民公社。佧佤山三百多户佧佤族的贺南人民公社就是这样办起来的。1958年春天，总路线的光辉照亮了他们前进的方向，大跃进的号角激发了他们的斗志更加昂扬。他们要大修水利，要大开水田，要办工厂，要发展经济作物，还要建电站、办学校。农业生产合作社力量小，办不了这些事，他们就合并了十个农业社，建成了一个政社合一的大社，党中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”发表后，便正式叫做人民公社。建社第一年，农业、工业、文教卫生就获得了全面的大发展，社员生活大大提高。云南边疆民族地区，在生产发展的推动和群众迫切要求下，提前三年实现了合作化，办起了六千六百七十三个合作社，并在一部分基础较好的地区办了联社和人民公社，入社农户已占总农户的90％以上。这些合作社和人民公社，是根据边疆的特点和民族的特点，从有利于发展生产，有利于团结大多数人民，有利于巩固祖国边防出发，以不同的方式和步骤建立起来的。在生产资料的处理、积累比例、分配政策和经营管理方面，都分别采用了不同的办法。这样，就使合作社和人民公社更适合边疆民族地区的生产水平和群众的觉悟程度，使群众有一个逐步习惯的过程，比较自然地由个体生产转为集体生产，由个体经济转为集体经济，也使民族上层人士能够比较从容地思考这个伟大的变革。
    这样办起来的合作社和人民公社，经过调整，日益巩固，显示了无比的优越性和旺盛的生命力，进一步解放了生产力，对推动边疆民族地区的经济、文化各方面发展，起了决定性的作用。粮食在1958年空前大丰收的基础上，1959年又增长了15％以上。怒江傈僳族自治州十年来粮食已翻了四番。澜沧拉祜族自治县由拉祜和佧佤两个民族组成的糯吾下寨合作社，粮食增长更快，解放前，平均每人每年收入粮食还不到一百斤，镰刀一歇手就饿肚子，解放后，在党和政府的大力扶持下，生产逐年发展，1957年，平均每人已有粮食二百五十五斤，1958年办起了合作社，粮食猛增到平均每人一千一百斤，1959年继续大跃进，达到平均每人有粮二千四百九十七斤，平均每户还卖了二千五百九十三斤余粮给国家。不仅粮食大增产，经济作物的产量也大大提高。出产在西双版纳的“普洱茶”，1958年产四百二十多万斤，1959年增产到五百八十多万斤。甘蔗、棉花也都有很大增长，还大量发展了咖啡、芳香油、栲胶、樟脑等热带和亚热带作物。边疆原来是个基本上没有工业的地区，1958年办了三千多个厂矿，结束了边疆各民族没有工业的历史，1959年工业遍地开花，几乎所有的合作社、人民公社都办了规模大小不等的工厂，技术水平显著提高。西双版纳的景德工厂，1954年初成立时，只能酿酒、榨油，现在已经是能生产碾米机、电动机、鼓风机和机床的农业机械厂。在交通方面，过去车路不通，马也难行的闭塞情况，已有极大的改变，除个别县外，都通了公路。文教卫生事业也是大跃进的。小学入学人数已达适龄儿童的66％，中学入学人数比1958年增加了48％，卫生事业的发展，改变了“瘴疠之区”的面貌，基本上制止了鼠疫、恶性疟疾的流传，送走了边疆的两个大瘟神。生产和文教卫生事业的发展，已说明各族人民物质和文化生活的改善，不仅绝大多数人增加了收入，有一半左右的社员参加了公共食堂，而且文工团、电影队和优秀的民族文学艺术创作也都有很大发展。与各民族原来的落后面貌对比起来，真是一个翻天复地的变化。
    经济基础的发展必然地促进了上层建筑的变化，促进了各族人民思想情况和精神面貌的变化。在集体生产中，自动地打破了许多拜神祭鬼的迷信，废除了许多有碍生产的陈规陋习。在这个基础上进一步发扬了民族的优良传统。由于长期的民族压迫造成的民族自卑心理正逐步消除，过去认为“汉族的先进生产方法，我们办不到”，现在他们说：“汉族老大哥能办的，我们也一定能办到”。过去不犁冬田，现在不仅犁冬田，而且犁的十分认真；过去认为施肥的庄稼饭会臭，现在不仅施肥，而且大施人畜粪肥；过去认为妇女犁田，天会旱、雷会打、谷会瘟、山会断、牛会哭，现在妇女犁田不仅已成普遍现象，而且出现了许多妇女犁田能手。生产技术逐步提高，生产大发展，思想不断解放，学会了使用新式农具，工具改革也干得有声有色。南糯山的哈尼族人民公社，是盛产名茶的地方，过去只是采茶卖鲜叶，1958年成立了公社，学会了制茶，每个生产队都办了红茶初制厂，1959年展开了技术革新和技术革命运动，每个厂的管理人员由三至四人，减少到一至二人。经过两年的连续跃进，民族干部队伍也迅速地壮大了，群众的社会主义觉悟显著提高，他们在实践中受到了一定的锻炼，涌现了成批的积极分子，成为各族人民沿着社会主义道路自己解放自己的骨干。民族上层人士在政治上生活上都得到了妥善的安排和照顾，经过爱国主义和社会主义教育及一系列的运动，看到祖国社会主义建设事业欣欣向荣，边疆的经济、文化一日千里地蓬勃发展，自己民族的落后状况正在迅速改变，思想上也得到了不同程度的提高，绝大部分都放弃了剥削，愿意向党靠拢，拥护社会主义。一切可以团结的力量，都在社会主义的旗帜下得到了进一步的团结，形成了边疆进行社会主义改造和建设的巨大力量。与帝国主义和敌特分子阴谋破坏的斗争，不断取得新的胜利。一切损害社会主义事业和祖国统一的行为，必然受会到各族人民的反对，并陷于孤立。各族人民从亲身经历中体会到了组织起来的好处，总路线、大跃进、人民公社，更加深入人心，跟着共产党走，跟着毛主席走，走社会主义道路的决心更加坚定。
    那种片面强调落后、特殊而认为民族地区不能高速度发展生产，不能跃进的看法，在两年连续大跃进的事实面前是站不住脚了。去冬今春，边疆兴修水利灌溉面积六十万亩，新垦荒地二百多万亩，备耕工作比往年抓的又早又好，绝大部分地区在春节前完成了翻耕冬田的任务，养猪积肥，大干经济作物正在形成高潮，今年边疆的连续跃进已有一个振奋人心的开端。
    边疆各民族虽然取得了两年来连续跃进的巨大成就，但并未根本改变贫困落后的面貌，需要继续昂首阔步地前进。继续加强社会主义教育，不断提高各族人民的觉悟，保持高度警惕，粉碎帝国主义和敌特分子的破坏阴谋，在汉族人民的帮助下，充分运用一切有利条件，实现今年生产的继续跃进。快马加鞭，发展经济文化，赶上先进民族的水平，争取早日跻于先进民族的行列。
    云南边疆是祖国一块美丽富饶的地方，有着广阔肥沃的土地，雨量充沛，气候温暖，适合热带、亚热带经济作物的生长，许多丰富的资源正待开发出来，为祖国的社会主义建设服务，但是由于边疆地广人稀，加上物力、财力、技术水平都有限，必须依靠祖国的伟大力量，内地的先进民族特别是汉族人民大力全面的支援，边疆的资源才能充分地发挥出来，最近已有一批来自我们各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席家乡的青年，到云南边疆来参加建设，他们带来了党和毛主席对我们的关怀，带来了老革命根据地的共产主义英雄气概的榜样，同时带来了汉族老大哥的先进生产技术和先进文化艺术，对于加强民族团结，促进边疆社会主义建设发展起了极大的作用，因此受到了云南边疆各族人民的热烈欢迎。为了祖国边疆的社会主义建设事业迅速发展，为了各族人民的共同利益，我们热烈地欢迎更多的内地同胞继续来支援我们。
    正当我们各族人民团结在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，共同建设伟大祖国大家庭的时候，我们听到在印度尼西亚的侨胞，在那里遭受迫害，我们非常同情和关怀他们，最近我国政府已派船只去接运那些被迫害流离失所而愿意回到祖国怀抱来的侨胞，我们也热烈地欢迎他们到云南边疆来和我们一起共同建设我们伟大祖国的大家庭。
    云南是祖国的西南边疆，与我们的友好邻邦缅甸山水相连，村寨相望，在增进中缅两国人民的友谊方面，负有重大任务。解放几年来，边疆各族人民一直遵循着党的教导，按照和平共处五项原则，发展了我们与缅甸人民的传统友谊。我国政府代表全国人民的愿望和利益，与缅甸政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和两国关于边界问题的协定，使中缅友好关系的发展进入了一个新的阶段，为全面解决帝国主义遗留下来的、复杂的边界问题铺平了道路，将为两国的建设和人民的幸福带来许多好处。边疆各族人民为此感到十分高兴，我们坚决拥护这个条约，继续努力增进中缅两国人民的友谊，积极协助政府最后全面解决边界问题。
    我们已经有了一幅1960年继续跃进的壮丽图景，继续跃进的东风已吹遍了祖国各地，吹到了云南边疆。光辉的成就，胜利的形势，灿烂的前景，鼓舞着我们继续跃进。坚持党的领导，高举三大法宝的伟大旗帜，团结在祖国统一的大家庭里，我们一定要以更大的努力，认真学习毛主席的著作，继续提高思想为社会主义建设贡献出自己的力量，争取多快好省地实现今年的继续跃进，建设社会主义祖国边疆。
