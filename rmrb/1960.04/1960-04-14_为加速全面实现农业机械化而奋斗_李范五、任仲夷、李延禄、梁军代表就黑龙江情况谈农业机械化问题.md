Comrades Representatives:
    We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will resolutely implement them in future work. Now, regarding the situation in Heilongjiang Province, we would like to express some opinions on accelerating the comprehensive realization of agricultural mechanization. Any inappropriate points, please correct us.
    Agriculture is the foundation of the development of the national economy. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "China is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80 percent of the total population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only then will industry have raw materials and markets, and only then will it be possible to accumulate more funds for building a strong heavy industry." Under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously is one of the important contents of the Party's general line for socialist construction. The process of socialist construction in Heilongjiang Province proves that the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party's policy of industry and agriculture going hand in hand are completely correct.
    Heilongjiang Province is one of the country's important industrial bases and also one of the country's important agricultural regions. In recent years, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, while strengthening the leadership of industrial construction, we have also unremittingly strengthened the leadership of agriculture, and while rapidly developing industry, we have vigorously developed agriculture. By 1959, the province's cultivated land area had expanded from more than 85 million mu in 1949 to more than 110 million mu, an increase of 30%; the total output of grain and soybeans had increased from 11.54 billion jin in 1949 (including 2.16 billion jin of soybeans) to 22.5 billion jin (including 4 billion jin of soybeans), an increase of nearly one-fold; the number of large livestock had increased from 1.675 million heads in 1949 to 2 million heads, an increase of 20%. Other livestock products and cash crops have also experienced tremendous growth. Due to the rapid development of agricultural production, the commodity volume of agricultural products has also increased rapidly. The annual commodity rate has reached 40% to 50%. Over the past decade, the rural areas of our province have provided a total of more than 74 billion jin of marketable grain (including more than 34 billion jin of soybeans) and more than 8 billion jin of meat, eggs, vegetables, and other non-staple foods. It has also transferred a large amount of labor to support industrial construction. In 1949, an average of three rural people supplied one urban person, while in 1959, an average of one and a half people supplied one urban person. It is entirely conceivable that in this situation, without the rapid development and strong support of agriculture, the rapid development of industry would be impossible.
    In recent years, although agriculture in our province has made great progress, thus ensuring the construction of the industrial base and completing the task of transferring agricultural products to other areas, because the development of industry in our province is particularly rapid, it has increased twelvefold in ten years. At the same time, as an important agricultural region with vast land, it needs to provide the country with more agricultural products. Therefore, we must continue to implement the central government's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and rapidly developing agriculture. We must also more rapidly develop agricultural production in our province, especially the currently still weak diversified economy, to fully meet the needs of industrial and the entire national economic development and support national construction. For this, we must take mechanization as the center and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture to solve the contradiction of having a large land area but a small population and a shortage of labor, which is particularly prominent in our province.
    The promotion of agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province has a history of more than ten years, starting from the pilot period. Now agricultural mechanization has a preliminary foundation. The province has more than 12,000 standard tractors, and the area cultivated by machines accounts for more than 20% of the total cultivated area. There are also 240,000 new-style animal-powered farm tools, and the cultivated area accounts for about 30% of the total cultivated area. The total of the two accounts for more than 50% of the total cultivated area. In terms of non-field operations, such as grain processing, feed crushing, threshing, and straw cutting, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has also reached more than 50%. For more than ten years, although agricultural mechanization has been promoted on a small scale in some areas, it has shown great superiority: First, it has powerfully promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the development and growth of the people's communes. The powerful power of agricultural mechanization has profoundly educated the farmers, who said: "Land reform liberated the farmers, and mechanization can liberate the land, but it is impossible to achieve mechanization without organizing." Therefore, agricultural mechanization has become a huge force attracting farmers to take the road of cooperation and communization. At the same time, with agricultural mechanization, cooperatives and communes are easier to consolidate and develop. After the people's communes were established, mechanization more powerfully promoted the rapid growth of the commune-level economy and the continuous expansion of the factors of ownership by the whole people. Taking the Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County as an example, in 1957, the public accumulation of this commune accounted for 7.2% of the net income. In 1958, the area cultivated by machines accounted for 36% of the total cultivated area, and the public accumulation rose to 14.9% of the net income. By 1959, the area cultivated by machines had reached 50%, and the proportion of public accumulation in net income had increased to 22.2%. At present, the total value of the means of production of the commune is 3.12 million yuan, of which the part owned by the commune level has reached 2.57 million yuan, accounting for 82.5%. Second, it has expanded the cultivated land area. Over the past decade, the province has reclaimed more than 25 million mu of wasteland, of which 80% was reclaimed by tractors. Third, it has greatly increased agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products. For example, in 1959, the state-owned Zhaoguang Farm, which basically realized mechanization, produced an average of more than 40,000 jin of grain per worker per year, with a commodity rate of 74%; the ninth branch of Luobei Farm produced an average of 100,700 jin of grain per worker per year; Baiquan County, which partially used machines for production, produced an average of 18,800 jin of grain per worker, with a commodity rate of more than 50%; while in areas using old-style farm tools, the average worker only produced 9,000 jin of grain, with a commodity rate of only about 40%. Fourth, it has powerfully promoted the comprehensive development of agriculture, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. For example, in 1959, the aforementioned Baiquan Xingnong Commune, because the area cultivated by machines accounted for 50%, freed up more than 1,000 workers (25% of the total labor force), 47 horse-drawn carts, and 312 draft horses to engage in capital construction, develop commune-run industry and diversified operations, and established more than 130 repair factories, iron and wood factories, power plants, rice mills, weaving factories, etc. It also established many large-scale livestock farms, powerfully promoting the comprehensive development of the commune economy. Fifth, it has promoted the development of rural cultural and educational and scientific and technological undertakings. At present, more than 1,000 commune-run technical night schools have been established in the province's rural areas, and most young and middle-aged people have participated in the study; more than 370 commune-run and county-run technical training classes have been established, with more than 12,000 students. Through study and practical training, many former "bosses," "pig officials," and housewives have now become tractor drivers, combine operators, and machine repair workers. Many grassroots cadres who were called "white hats" have also become experts proficient in their business. With the development of the agricultural mechanization movement, the technical strength in rural areas is constantly developing and growing, and the cultural outlook is rapidly changing. Sixth, it has linked farmers with modern machines and greatly changed people's mental outlook. The working-class consciousness of the broad masses of farmers is constantly growing, their socialist and communist consciousness is further enhanced, their determination to take the socialist road is more firm, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. In short, the development of agricultural mechanization has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production, thus promoting the development of industry and the entire national economy, greatly promoting the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and is gradually narrowing the distance between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, fundamentally changing the economic and social outlook of the countryside. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his works on agricultural cooperation: "China can only fundamentally change its socio-economic outlook when it has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in terms of socio-economic system, and also uses machines in all departments and places where machines can be used in terms of technology."
    After more than ten years of exploration, our main experiences in promoting agricultural mechanization are: First, we must adhere to opposing capitalist ideology and right-leaning conservative ideology. Realizing agricultural mechanization is a great revolution in the countryside. Experience shows that in this technical revolution movement, as in other revolutionary movements, there is a struggle between two roads and two methods. Only by first eliminating all ideological obstacles can agricultural mechanization be carried out smoothly. In the early stage of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, some people said: "Agricultural mechanization destroys the traditional agricultural farming system," "destroys the inherent experience of farmers," and "production has increased without mechanization for thousands of years." We have resolutely criticized these right-leaning conservative ideas, thereby continuously improving the understanding of agricultural mechanization by the vast number of cadres and masses, and strengthening their confidence in taking the road of mechanization, laying a reliable ideological foundation for the smooth promotion of mechanization. Second, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. In the process of promoting mechanization in our province, some cadres had a mentality of simply relying on the state. They believed that farmers were "poor and blank" and could not get involved in the mechanization cause, and that they "could not afford to buy, use, or manage" tractors. Practice has proved that this idea is completely wrong. The fact is: realizing agricultural mechanization is the urgent demand of the vast number of farmers. In order to get rid of heavy physical labor and develop production at high speed, they are extremely enthusiastic in raising funds, learning technology, and other aspects. For example, by the end of 1959, Baiquan County had invested a total of 4.5 million yuan in mechanization, of which 3.2 million yuan, or 70%, was raised by the masses themselves (including the public accumulation of the communes), and their more than 800 formal drivers were also basically trained locally. Facts have proved that the masses can not only afford to buy agricultural machinery, but they can also completely use and manage it well. In the cause of promoting agricultural mechanization, if we do not fully mobilize and rely on the great power of the masses, it will be absolutely impossible to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Of course, for such a major historical task as realizing agricultural mechanization, it is impossible without the strong support of the state. In fact, the state has already given great help, and will give more help in the future. However, the state's assistance must be combined with the power of the masses to play a greater role. Third, we must make overall plans and organize all relevant departments to divide labor and cooperate, and work together. Promoting agricultural mechanization is a great revolution to comprehensively transform the countryside in terms of economy, technology, ideology, and culture. Therefore, we must never understand it as something that only involves the agricultural sector, as some people do, and it cannot be accomplished by any one department alone. The whole Party and the whole people must work together. In recent years, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on "overall planning and strengthening leadership," under the unified leadership of the Party, we have organized all departments such as industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, science, culture, and education to divide labor and cooperate, and work together. We have adopted methods such as worker-peasant cooperation, industrial-commercial cooperation, factory-commune liaison, and dividing and contracting areas, and widely carried out the movement to support agricultural technological transformation, which has played a huge role in promoting the development of agricultural mechanization. For example, Yian County adopted these methods, and in just over a year, the county's eleven rural people's communes had established eleven farm tool machinery repair and manufacturing plants, nineteen small power plants, equipped with 67 various machine tools (an average of six per commune), 23 generators, and 113 diesel engines, boiler engines, gasoline engines, and electric motors (an average of 10.2 per commune), as well as complete sets of equipment such as sand casting furnaces, wheel saws, blowers, and woodworking machinery. Now each commune can repair large farm tools, manufacture small farm tools, and carry out medium and small repairs of tractors and power machinery. In the past, farmers said: "Tractors are good, but they can't be repaired when they break down, and you have to run to the county even for a screw." Now farmers say: "Setting up factories and running industries means that tractors don't have to suffer when they break down." This is the result of great cooperation in all aspects. Fourth, mechanization of field operations and mechanization of non-field operations should be carried out simultaneously. The characteristic of agriculture is that planting is the main body. Therefore, the technological transformation of agriculture must of course focus on the mechanization of field operations. However, we must never neglect the mechanization of non-field operations. The amount of labor required for non-field operations is very large. From the perspective of our province, it generally accounts for about 40% of the total rural labor force. If this part of heavy physical labor is not liberated, it will not only be impossible to use more labor to increase the amount of labor used in field operations, but it will also inevitably affect the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. In addition, the machines required for non-field operations are generally relatively simple, and county and commune industries can manufacture them. Therefore, it is entirely possible to realize the mechanization of non-field operations more quickly. If we neglect this aspect, it will inevitably delay the entire process of mechanization. In the early stage of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, due to lack of experience, some state-owned farms carried out the mechanization of field operations in isolation, while other operations were still done manually, so that various production activities could not be closely connected, and the efficiency of machines could not be fully utilized. In 1959, we emphasized the policy of "walking on two legs," and while actively promoting the mechanization of field operations, we vigorously mobilized the masses to promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of non-field operations, and achieved great results. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of operations such as grain processing, feed crushing, and straw cutting in the province has reached more than 50%, and two-fifths of the counties have basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of these operations. A total of 220,000 laborers were saved throughout the year and put into other production. Facts have shown that this "walking on two legs" method is a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Fifth, the promotion of agricultural mechanization must be combined with the original excellent farming experience to improve the level of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" and ensure increased agricultural production. The promotion of agricultural mechanization will inevitably change some original farming systems and farming methods, which is inevitable and necessary. However, we must apply and carry forward the many valuable experiences that farmers have accumulated in their production practice over thousands of years, and we must never deny them across the board. In the process of promoting mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, some people disregarded local experience, technology, and natural conditions, and mechanically copied the experience of other places, which affected production. Facts have proved that only by combining modern technology with the inherent excellent production experience of farmers can we give full play to the efficiency of agricultural machinery, better implement the "Eight-Character Charter," and achieve rapid production increases. For this, we must reform and create agricultural machinery to adapt to different conditions. After several years of exploration, we have now made some achievements in this area, such as the development of seeders that sow and ridge at the same time, inter-row cultivators, and tall-stalk crop harvesters that are suitable for the conditions in our province. However, there are still many problems that need to be continuously solved. Sixth, combine "machines, horses, and cattle," combine mechanization with the improvement of farm tools, and combine large, medium, and small machines. Mechanization, like everything else, is a process of development from low to high and from less to more. Therefore, in promoting mechanization, we must never ignore the role of draught animals and improved farm tools. If we do, it will be divorced from reality and from the masses. The experience of our province proves that production has suffered unnecessary losses in all places that have not paid attention to this issue. In addition, because the various productions of agriculture contain a variety of complex operations, it is not enough to only pay attention to large machines. We must combine large, medium, and small machines to fully realize mechanization and truly achieve the goal of improving labor efficiency and rapidly increasing production. Seventh, regarding the issue of the operating form of agricultural machinery. In the early stage of the elementary cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province, the universal practice was for state-run tractor stations to cultivate for farmers on behalf of the state, that is, the form of state-owned and state-operated. This was completely necessary and appropriate at that time, when the cooperative's economic strength was weak and it had little experience. However, because farmers did not directly participate in the management of the machines, it affected the efficiency of the machines, the improvement of cultivation quality, and the reduction of costs. Later, with the development of advanced cooperativization, we adopted the form of self-purchase and self-use by advanced cooperatives, that is, collective ownership and collective operation, so that the management and use of machines were closely combined with production. This form basically solved the above-mentioned contradictions and was universally welcomed by the masses, so it was quickly promoted throughout the province. On this basis, after the establishment of the people's communes, there were two forms: commune-owned and commune-operated and district-owned (the original advanced cooperative) and district-operated. Later, commune-owned and district-operated was universally implemented. Our experience shows that implementing commune-owned and commune-operated, cultivating on behalf of basic-level units, can strengthen commune ownership, but the responsibility system is not clear. Implementing the district-owned and district-operated method is not conducive to the expansion of commune ownership and the growth of factors of ownership by the whole people, and it is also not conducive to the unified leadership of the commune and the rapid development of mechanization. However, implementing the commune-owned and district-operated method, with the commune as the owner of the machines and the management district as the unit responsible for contracting for the use, repair, and costs of the machines, can avoid the shortcomings of the aforementioned two methods, basically achieving the goal of accelerating the growth of the commune economy, clarifying responsibilities, giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running mechanization, and being conducive to production. Therefore, it seems that under the current conditions, this operating method is more appropriate.
    In order to develop agriculture in our province at high speed to meet the needs of the development of the entire national economy, we have formulated a plan to basically realize agricultural mechanization in the next five years in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on accelerating the promotion of agricultural technological transformation. Last winter, we began to launch a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the province. Now, this movement has expanded from production departments to catering, laundry, and other living service departments; from single, sporadic reforms to comprehensive, systematic, and complete reforms; from the reform of general manual tools to the invention and creation of new machines; from the reform of operating tools to the creation of power machinery. In operations such as pig raising, chicken raising, threshing, and canteens, more than 50 automatic and linkage lines have appeared, increasing production efficiency by dozens of times. The Geshan Reservoir construction site in Suiling County also created a record of blasting a large canal 460 meters long, 40 meters wide, and 11 meters deep with one shot, which is equivalent to the work of 360,000 laborers in one day. The momentum and effect of this mass-based mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement further prove that carrying out mass movements on a large scale is the most correct and effective way to accelerate the realization of technological transformation. Relying on the great power of this mass movement, we plan that this year, in addition to basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of threshing, grain processing, feed crushing, water conservancy and drainage, and other tasks throughout the province, we will also strive to create typical examples of "complete sets and lines" in animal husbandry, water conservancy construction, field transportation, and canteens to lay a good foundation for accelerating the comprehensive realization of mechanization. At present, we are focusing on the following eight aspects of work: First, comprehensively plan and implement the plan at all levels. Through planning, we will unify and organize the forces of industry and agriculture, as well as all aspects, and make unified arrangements for manpower, materials, and financial resources to ensure that the goals of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization are achieved in stages and in batches. Second, establish a manufacturing and repair system for agricultural machinery and tools. In addition to the new construction and expansion of a number of backbone factories at the provincial and special district levels, which are responsible for the manufacture of large machines, the county and commune should each build a manufacturing and repair factory this year, and the management district should build a repair station, striving to achieve small repairs in the district, large repairs in the commune, and the repair of precision parts within the county. Third, strengthen the training of technical personnel and scientific research. In line with the policy of "one main, two secondary, and three combinations," we will implement professional colleges and affiliated schools at the same time, regular schools and amateur schools at the same time, and the five levels of province, special district, city, county, and commune (farm) will work together. The education, scientific research, and production departments will advance on three fronts to train a large number of technical talents. At the same time, establish and improve scientific research institutions and carry out mass scientific research. Fourth, widely open up sources of raw materials for the manufacture of agricultural machinery and tools. In addition to the part allocated by the state, we will mobilize counties and communes to run raw material industries on a large scale, and promote methods such as renovating old parts and using one thing for multiple purposes to fully utilize substitutes and discarded materials. Fifth, increase power. Adhering to the principle of from low to high and combining indigenous and foreign methods, we will utilize all available energy sources such as water, fire, wind, gas, and electricity. Sixth, strengthen business management. Improve existing management institutions and strive to normalize mechanical operations this year and create experience in rational business management. Seventh, summarize experience. This year, we plan to focus on summarizing and solving the problems of power, serialization of field mechanical cultivation, mechanization and semi-mechanization of non-field operations, and other experiences, and promote them. Eighth, carry out large-scale cooperation. Under the unified leadership of the Party, we will further organize all departments such as industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, science, culture, and education to divide labor and cooperate, and give greater play to accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization.
    Although agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province has a preliminary foundation, it is still far from the goal of comprehensively realizing mechanization. Our experience is still insufficient, and our future tasks are still quite arduous. However, we believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the strong support of the state, and on the basis of the sound development of the people's communes, fully relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the great task of agricultural technological transformation will definitely be accelerated. Let us work together with all parts of the country to strive to accelerate the comprehensive realization of agricultural mechanization!

    为加速全面实现农业机械化而奋斗
    李范五、任仲夷、李延禄、梁军代表就黑龙江情况谈农业机械化问题各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告，并要在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现仅就黑龙江省的情况，对加速全面实现农业机械化问题发表一些意见，不妥之处，请指正。
    农业是国民经济发展的基础。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中说：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金”。在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举，是党的社会主义建设总路线的基本点的重要内容之一。黑龙江省社会主义建设的过程，证明了党中央和毛泽东同志的指示和党所规定的工农并举的方针是完全正确的。
    黑龙江省是国家的重要工业基地之一，又是国家的重要农业地区之一。几年来，我们根据党中央和毛主席的指示精神，在加强对工业建设领导的同时，也毫不放松地加强了对农业的领导，在迅速发展工业的同时，大力发展了农业。到1959年，全省耕地面积由1949年的八千五百多万亩，扩大到一亿一千多万亩，增加了30％；粮食和大豆的总产量由1949年的一百一十五亿四千万斤（其中大豆为二十一亿六千万斤），增加到二百二十五亿斤（其中大豆为四十亿斤），增长将近一倍；大牲畜由1949年的一百六十七万五千头，增加到二百万头，增长20％。其他畜产品和经济作物等，也都有巨大的增长。由于农业生产的迅速发展，农产品的商品量也有了迅速提高。每年的商品率已达40％到50％。十年来我省农村共提供商品粮七百四十多亿斤（其中大豆为三百四十多亿斤）、肉蛋蔬菜等副食品八十多亿斤。并输送了大量的劳动力，支援了工业建设。1949年平均三个农村人口供应一个城市人口，而1959年则平均为一个半人口供应一个城市人口。完全可以想见，在这种情况下，如果没有农业的迅速发展和大力支援，工业的迅速发展是不可能的。
    几年来，虽然我省农业有了很大的发展，因而保证了工业基地的建设，并完成了农产品的外调任务。但由于我省工业的发展特别迅速，十年增长了十二倍，同时作为一个土地辽阔的重要农业地区，需要为国家提供更多的农产品，所以我们还必须坚持贯彻执行中央所指示的以农业为基础、优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，更加迅速地发展我省的农业生产，特别是发展目前还较薄弱的多种经营，以充分满足工业和整个国民经济发展及支援国家建设的需要。而为此就必须以机械化为中心，加速实现农业的技术改造，以解决在我省特别突出的地多人少、劳动力不足的矛盾。
    黑龙江省推行农业机械化，从试点时期算起，已经有十多年的历史，现在农业机械化已经有了初步的基础。全省共有拖拉机一万二千多标准台，机耕面积占总耕地面积20％以上。还有新式畜力农具二十四万台，耕作面积占总耕地面积的30％左右，两者合计占总耕地面积的50％以上。在非田间作业方面，如粮米加工、饲料粉碎、脱谷、铡草等项作业的机械化、半机械化程度也已达50％以上。十多年来，虽然农业机械化还是小规模的在部分地区推行的，但它已显示出巨大的优越性：第一，它有力地促进了互助合作运动的发展和人民公社的发展、壮大。农业机械化的强大威力，深刻地教育了农民，他们说：“土地改革使农民翻了身，有了机械化土地才能翻身，但不组织起来就不可能实现机械化。”因此，农业机械化成为吸引农民走合作化和公社化道路的一个巨大力量。同时有了农业机械化以后，合作社和公社也就更容易巩固和发展。人民公社化后，机械化更有力地促进了公社一级经济的迅速增长和全民所有制因素的不断扩大。以拜泉县兴农人民公社为例，这个社1957年公共积累占纯收入的7.2％，1958年机耕面积占总耕地面积的36％，公共积累上升到占纯收入的14.9％，到1959年机耕面积达到50％，公共积累占纯收入的比重已增长到22.2％。目前该社生产资料总值为三百一十二万元，其中属于公社一级所有部分已达二百五十七万元，占82.5％。第二，扩大了耕地面积。十年来全省共开荒二千五百多万亩，其中用拖拉机开垦的即占80％。第三，大大提高了农业劳动生产率和农产品的商品率。如1959年基本上实现了机械化的国营赵光农场，平均每个劳动力年生产粮食四万多斤，商品率达74％；萝北农场九分场平均每个劳动力年生产粮食已达十万零七百斤；部分使用机器生产的拜泉县平均每个劳动力生产粮食一万八千八百斤，商品率占50％以上；而使用旧式农具的地方平均每个劳动力生产的粮食则仅为九千斤，商品率只占40％左右。第四，有力地促进了农、工、林、牧、副、渔的全面发展。如上述拜泉兴农公社1959年由于机耕面积已占50％，因而腾出了一千多名劳动力（占劳动力总数的25％）、四十七台马车、三百一十二匹役马，从事基本建设、发展社办工业和多种经营，共建立起修配厂、铁木厂、发电厂、制米厂、编织厂等一百三十多处，还办起许多规模较大的畜牧场等，有力地促进了公社经济的全面发展。第五，促进了农村文化教育和科学技术事业的发展。现在全省农村已建立起社办技术夜校一千余处，大部分青壮年都参加了学习；社办和县办技术训练班三百七十多处，学员达一万二千余人。经过学习和实际锻炼，过去的许多“老板子”、“小猪官”、家庭妇女，现在已经成为拖拉机驾驶员、康拜因手和机器修理工。许多被人称为“白帽子”的基层干部，也已成为精通业务的内行了。随着农业机械化运动的发展，农村的技术力量正在不断地发展壮大，文化面貌正在迅速改观。第六，把农民和近代化大机器联系起来，也大大改变了人们的精神面貌。广大农民中的工人阶级意识正在不断的增长，社会主义、共产主义觉悟更加提高，走社会主义道路的决心更加坚定，生产积极性更加高涨。总之，农业机械化事业的发展，大大促进了农业生产的发展，因而也就促进了工业和整个国民经济的发展，大大促进了工农联盟的巩固，并且正在逐步缩小着工农、城乡、脑力劳动与体力劳动的距离，正在从根本上改变着农村的经济和社会面貌。正如毛泽东同志在关于农业合作化问题的著作中所指出的那样：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观”。
    经过十多年来的摸索，我们在推行农业机械化过程中取得的主要经验是：第一，必须坚持反对资本主义思想和右倾保守思想。实现农业机械化是农村中的一个伟大的革命。经验证明，在这个技术革命运动中，也和其他革命运动一样，存在着两条道路、两种方法的斗争。只有首先扫除各种思想阻力，才能使农业机械化得以顺利地进行。黑龙江省在推行农业机械化的初期，曾有人说：“农业机械化破坏了农业传统的耕作制度”，“摧毁了农民的固有经验”，“几千年来没有机械化也一样增产”。我们对于这些右倾保守思想进行了坚决的批判，从而不断提高了广大干部和群众对农业机械化的认识，坚定了走机械化道路的信心，为顺利推行机械化奠定了可靠的思想基础。第二，必须大搞群众运动。我省在推行机械化过程中，曾有一部分干部存在着一种单纯依靠国家的思想。他们认为，农民“一穷二白”，对机械化事业插不上手，有拖拉机也“买不起，使不了，管不好”。实践证明，这种想法是完全错误的。事实是：实现农业机械化是广大农民的迫切要求。他们为了脱摆笨重的体力劳动，高速度发展生产，在筹集资金、学习技术等方面的积极性是极高的。如拜泉县到1959年底，机械化投资共四百五十万元，其中就有三百二十万元即占70％是由群众自己筹集的（包括公社的公共积累），他们的八百多名正式驾驶员，也基本上是本地培养的。事实证明，对农业机械，群众不仅买得起，而且完全能够使得了，管得好。在推行农业机械化的事业中，如果我们不充分地发动和依靠群众的伟大力量，那就绝不可能做到多快好省。当然，对于实现农业机械化这样一个重大的历史任务，没有国家的大力支援是不行的。事实上国家已经给了很大的帮助，今后还将给予更多的帮助。但是国家的帮助必须同群众的力量结合起来，才能发挥更大的作用。第三，必须全面规划，组织各有关部门分工合作，一齐动手。推行农业机械化，是在经济上、技术上、思想上和文化上对农村进行全面改造的伟大的革命，因此，绝不能像有些人所理解的那样，把它仅仅看作是农业部门的事情，并且也绝非任何一个部门所能独力完成，而必须全党全民共同努力。几年来，我们按照毛泽东同志“全面规划，加强领导”的指示，在党的统一领导下，组织工业、农业、交通、财贸、科学文教等一切部门分工合作，一齐动手，采取了工农协作、工商协作、厂社挂钩、分片包干等办法，广泛开展了支援农业技术改造的运动，对于推动农业机械化的发展起了巨大的作用。如依安县采取了这些办法，仅一年多的时间，全县十一个农村人民公社就已经建立起农具机械修造厂十一处，小型发电厂十九处，装备了各种机床六十七台（每社平均六台），发电机二十三台，柴油机、锅驼机、汽油机、电动机等一百一十三台（平均每社十点二台），还有翻砂炉、轮子锯、鼓风机以及木工机械化等成套设备。现在各公社都可以做到大型农具自修，小型农具自造，并能够进行拖拉机和动力机械的中修和小修。过去农民说：“拖拉机好是好，就是爬窝治不了，缺个螺丝钉也得往县跑”。现在农民说：“开工厂，办工业，拖拉机坏了不受憋”。这正是各方面大协作的结果。第四，田间作业机械化与非田间作业机械化同时并举。农业的特点是以种植为主体，因此，农业技术改造当然必须以田间作业的机械化为主。但是决不能因此就忽视了非田间作业的机械化。非田间作业所需要的劳动量很大，从我省情况看来，一般约占农村总劳动量的40％左右。如果这一部分笨重的体力劳动不得到解放，不仅不能用更多的劳动力增加田间作业用工量，而且必然影响农、林、牧、副、渔的全面发展。另外，非田间作业需要的机器一般比较简单，县、社工业即可以制造，因此完全可以更快地实现非田间作业的机械化。如果我们忽视了这一方面，那就势必要延缓整个机械化的进程。黑龙江省在推行农业机械化的初期，由于缺乏经验，某些国营农场曾孤立地进行田间作业的机械化，其他作业仍然用手工操作，因而使各项生产不能密切衔接，机器效率也得不到充分发挥。1959年，我们强调了“两条腿走路”的方针，在积极推行田间作业机械化的同时，大力发动群众推行非田间作业的机械化和半机械化，收到很大的效果。目前全省粮米加工、饲料粉碎、铡草等项作业机械化、半机械化程度已达50％以上，有五分之二的县已基本上实现了这些作业项目的机械化、半机械化。全年共节省二十二万个劳动力投到其他生产中去。事实说明，这种“两条腿走路”的方法，是一条多快好省的途径。第五，推行农业机械化必须同原有的优良耕作经验相结合，以提高贯彻“八字宪法”的水平，确保农业的增产。农业机械化的推行，要改变一些原有的耕作制度和耕作方法，这是必然的，也是必要的。但对于农民在几千年来的生产实践中所积累的许多宝贵经验，必须加以运用和发扬，绝不可一概否定。黑龙江省在推行机械化的过程中，曾有的人不顾当地的经验、技术和自然条件，机械搬用外地经验，结果影响了生产。事实证明，只有使现代化技术与农民固有的优良生产经验结合起来，才能充分发挥农业机器的效率，使“八字宪法”得到更好的贯彻，收到迅速增产的效果；而为此就必须适应不同的条件来改革和创制农业机具。经过几年来的摸索，现在我们在这方面已经有了一些成绩，如制成了适合我省条件的随播随起垅的播种机、垅作中耕机、高秆作物收割机等。但也还有不少问题需要继续努力解决。第六，“机马牛”相结合、机械化与改良农具相结合、大中小机器相结。机械化和一切事物一样，是一个从低级到高级，从少到多的发展过程。因此，在推行机械化的时候，绝不可以忽视耕畜和改良农具的作用。如果这样，那就是脱离实际，脱离群众。我省的经验证明：凡是没有注意这个问题的地方都使生产受到了不应有的损失。另外，由于农业的各种生产包含着多种复杂的作业，所以光注意大机器也是不行的，必须把大中小机器结合起来，才能全面地实现机械化，真正达到提高劳动效率，迅速增产的目的。第七，关于农业机械的经营形式问题。黑龙江省在初级社时期，普遍采用了国家办拖拉机站为农民代耕，即国有国营的形式。这在当时合作社经济力量较弱、经验较少的情况下，是完全必要的、适当的。但是因为农民没有直接参加对机器的管理，影响了机器效率的发挥、耕作质量的提高和成本的降低。其后，随着高级合作化的发展，我们采取了由高级社自购自用，即社有社营的形式，使机器的管理使用和生产密切结合起来。这种形式基本上解决了上述矛盾，受到了群众的普遍欢迎，因而很快就在全省范围内得到推广。在此基础上，人民公社化后，曾出现过社有社营和区（原高级社）有区营两种形式，后来普遍实行了社有区营。我们的经验说明，实行社有社营，为基层单位代耕，可以加强公社所有制，但责任制不明确。实行区有区营的方式，不利于公社所有制的扩大和全民所有制因素的增长，同时也不便于公社的统一领导和机械化的迅速发展。而实行社有区营的方式，公社为机器的所有者，管理区是机器的包用包修包成本的单位，这样就可以避免前述两种方式的缺陷，基本上做到了加速壮大公社经济，责任明确，发挥群众办机械化的积极性和有利于生产。因此看来，在目前条件下，这一种经营方式是比较适当的。
    为了高速度发展我省农业，以适应整个国民经济发展的需要，我们遵照党中央和毛主席关于加速推行农业技术改造的指示，已制定了在今后五年内基本上实现农业机械化的规划，并已于去冬开始，在全省掀起了一个以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新、技术革命的全民运动。现在，这个运动已经由生产部门扩展到食堂、洗衣等生活服务部门；由单项的、零星的改革发展到全面的、系统的、成套的改革；由一般手工工具的改革发展到新式机器的发明创造；由作业工具的改革发展到动力机械的创制。在养猪、养鸡、脱谷、食堂等项作业中，还出现了五十余条自动线与联动线，使生产效率提高了几十倍。绥棱县阁山水库工地还创造了一炮炸成一条长四百六十米、宽四十米、深十一米大渠的纪录，等于三十六万个劳动力一天的工作量。这个广大群众性的群众技术革新技术革命运动发展的声势和效果，进一步证明了，大搞群众运动是加快实现技术改造的最正确、最有效的途径。依靠这个群众运动的伟大力量，我们计划今年除了在全省范围内基本实现脱谷、粮米加工、饲料粉碎、水利排灌等工作的机械化和半机械化以外，在畜牧业、水利施工、田间运输以及食堂等方面，也要力争作出“配套成线”的典型来，为加速全面实现机械化打下良好的基础。目前我们正抓以下八个方面的工作：第一，全面规划，层层落实规划。通过规划把工业和农业以及各方面的力量统一组织起来，统一安排人力、物力和财力，以保证农业机械化、半机械化的目标分期分批实现。第二，建立农机具的制造和修配体系。除省和专区新建和扩建一批骨干工厂，负责大型机器的制造以外，县和公社今年要各建一处制造、修配厂，管理区建一处修配所，争取作到小修在区，大修在社，精密部件的修理不出县。第三，加强技术人员的培养和科学研究工作。本着“一主二从三结合”的方针，实行专业院校与附属学校同时并举，正规学校与业余学校并举，省、专、市、县、社（场）五级动手，教育部门、科学研究部门和生产部门三路进军的办法，大量培养技术人材。同时，建立与健全科学研究机构，开展群众性的科学研究工作。第四，广泛开辟农业机具制造的原材料来源。除国家调拨的部分以外，发动县、社大办原材料工业，并推行旧件翻新，一物多用等办法充分利用代用品和边废材料。第五，增加动力。本着由低级到高级、土洋结合的原则，把能够利用的水、火、风、气、电等各种能源全部利用起来。第六，加强经营管理。健全已有的管理机构，力争在今年内做到机械作业正常化，创造出经营管理合理化的经验。第七，总结经验。今年拟着重总结解决动力问题、田间机械耕作系列化、非田间作业机械化和半机械化等经验，并加以推广。第八，大搞协作。在党的统一领导下，进一步组织工业、农业、交通、财贸、科学文教等一切部门分工合作，为加速实现农业机械化发挥更大的力量。
      黑龙江省的农业机械化，虽然已经有了初步基础，但距离全面实现机械化的目标还远。我们的经验还很不足，今后的任务还相当艰巨。但是，我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在国家的大力支持下，在人民公社健全发展的基础上，充分依靠群众的积极性和创造性，农业技术改造的伟大任务是一定能够加速实现的。让我们和全国各地一道，为加速全面实现农业机械化而奋斗！
