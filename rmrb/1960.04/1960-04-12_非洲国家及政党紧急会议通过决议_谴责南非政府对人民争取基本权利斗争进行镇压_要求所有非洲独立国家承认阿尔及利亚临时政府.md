Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 11th: The emergency meeting of African countries and parties discussing issues concerning the defense of African peace and security concluded on the 10th. The meeting passed a resolution condemning the South African government's bloody suppression of the people's struggle for basic rights, and condemning France's colonialist war in Algeria and the explosion of atomic devices in the Sahara Desert. The meeting opened on April 7th. Approximately three hundred representatives and observers from all over Africa participated.

    The resolution on South Africa, passed on the 10th, stated that the recent massacres and crisis in South Africa were caused by the racial discrimination policies of the South African Union government. The resolution said that independent African countries should consider severing diplomatic relations with South Africa and imposing an economic boycott on it. The resolution called on the African people to boycott South African goods and requested Asian and African countries to continue to urge the United Nations to take stronger action to deal with South Africa. The resolution also suggested that immediate measures should be taken to abolish the South African government's rule over Southwest Africa.

    The resolution on Algeria, passed by the meeting, demanded that all independent African countries recognize the Provisional Government of Algeria and requested France to hold negotiations with the Provisional Government on the issue of Algeria's complete independence. The resolution suggested that the next conference of independent African countries in June will consider establishing an African volunteer corps to fight alongside the Algerian National Liberation Army against the French colonialists.

    The resolution condemned the French atomic tests in the Sahara and demanded that all governments and organizations, especially governments and organizations of African countries, boycott French goods and freeze French assets. The resolution demanded that all legal means be used to stop such tests. The resolution also condemned France's tests in the Sahara as an act of hostility towards the African people and a violation of their sovereignty.

    The meeting demanded the fulfillment of the resolutions of the First All-African Peoples' Conference. The meeting also requested the United Nations to demand that colonialist countries clearly stipulate the date of independence for all African countries.
