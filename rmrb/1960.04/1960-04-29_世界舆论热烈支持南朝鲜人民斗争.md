Comprehensive report from our newspaper: World opinion in socialist countries, Asia, and Europe is enthusiastically supporting the South Korean people’s heroic struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique.

Demanding that the South Korean people decide their own destiny without any foreign interference.
British newspapers say: America's "democratic showcase" in the Far East has become a pile of broken glass.

TASS commentator Kharikov wrote on the 26th about the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, stating that the events in South Korea illustrate the truth that tanks and machine guns cannot suppress the people's anger.

The commentator wrote that Syngman Rhee's twelve-year rule had turned South Korea into a region of extreme poverty and disenfranchisement. However, this was entirely in line with the wishes of the US group that supported Syngman Rhee. The United States, in pursuing a policy of keeping Korea divided and turning South Korea into a US military base, was betting on Syngman Rhee.

The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on the 24th supporting the South Korean people's struggle against the US-Syngman Rhee clique.

The statement said that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, representing all the Vietnamese people, demands an immediate halt to the brutal suppression of the South Korean people by the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, the realization and guarantee of the South Korean people's democratic freedoms, the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, allowing the South Korean people to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference, and demands free and universal national elections to peacefully reunify Korea.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" newspaper pointed out in a commentary on the 27th that the fascist system in South Korea is a product of the United States, and all power is in the hands of the United States. The South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee regime is a struggle against the US imperialist system of enslavement. After fifteen years of suffering, the South Korean people have increasingly realized that only by driving US imperialism out of South Korea and eliminating all its lackeys can South Korea gain freedom, democracy, and a happy life, and the Korean nation can reunite.

The Mongolian People's Republic's "Labor News" published a commentary on the 19th, stating that the Syngman Rhee gang's attempt to suppress the people with the support of US imperialism will not succeed. The will of the people is a powerful force, and armies and weapons cannot shake the people's will to fight. The commentary said that the Mongolian working people fully sympathize with and support the struggle of the South Korean people.

Romania's "Defense of the Fatherland" newspaper commented on the 27th that Syngman Rhee's downfall is not only a failure of the South Korean reactionary regime but also a failure of all imperialists. The imperialists' "policy of strength" has suffered a shameful bankruptcy. Bayonets and deceptive tricks cannot stop the people's struggle or change the course of history.

The commentary concluded that after Syngman Rhee's downfall, South Korea's patriotic fighters did not end their struggle but entered a new stage.

Czechoslovakia's "Red Right" newspaper published a commentary on the 28th titled "The Downfall of a Dictator," stating that the news from Seoul about Syngman Rhee's resignation and the announcement that the March elections were invalid is a significant victory for the South Korean people in their difficult struggle.

The commentary said that the South Korean people's struggle has aroused a particularly strong reaction around the world. It makes it clearer what kind of people the United States supports and whitewashes.

The commentary pointed out that the appeal from the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party to the South Korean people, calling for talks between North and South Korea to end the division of the motherland, is of particular importance in the current situation in South Korea. Joint talks between North and South Koreans are the only guarantee that the fruits of the South Korean people's heroic struggle will not be taken away.

On the evening of the 25th, eight groups, including the Japan Peace Committee and the Japan-Korea Association, jointly held a rally in Tokyo to support the struggle of the South Korean people. Prominent figures from all walks of life, including Yoshitaro Hirano, Akira Kazami, and Ryuko Oyama, attended the rally. The meeting pointed out the need to launch a propaganda campaign to make the Japanese people further understand the struggle of the South Korean people.

Seven mass organizations, including the Japan Peace Committee, issued a statement on the 27th expressing their support for the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique and against the occupation of US troops. The statement demanded that the United States withdraw its troops from South Korea and let the Korean people solve the Korean issue themselves.

These seven groups will jointly hold a conference on May 23 to express the Japanese people's support for the South Korean people's struggle.

Indonesia's "Dawn Daily" said that the South Korean people's opposition to Syngman Rhee is also opposition to the United States. The newspaper pointed out that during the Syngman Rhee group's rule in South Korea, the Korean War broke out, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of people, and South Korea is still occupied by US troops today. The South Korean people are dissatisfied with Syngman Rhee's policies.

Cambodia's "Friendship News" revealed in a commentary that the United States intends to replace Syngman Rhee with a new person to continue deceiving the Korean people. The commentary said, "The situation in South Korea shows us that no matter how strong the reactionary forces are, they cannot last long, and this situation will change sooner or later."

Baldomero Oliveira, president of the Philippine News Agency, who had just visited Seoul, said on April 20, "The violent tactics adopted by Syngman Rhee's people are bound to lead to riots." He said that the South Korean people had had enough of Syngman Rhee's dictatorial methods and the rampant corruption of officials at all levels of the Syngman Rhee group.

The British "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 28th demanding that the US occupation forces withdraw from South Korea.

The editorial said: "Syngman Rhee's corrupt, brutal, and US-backed regime is collapsing. But foreign infantry, tanks, and planes, which support Syngman Rhee against the will of the majority of the people, remain in South Korea.

The editorial pointed out: "Although Syngman Rhee has had to step down, the South Korean people have not gained freedom. They will have great difficulty in gaining freedom because the US occupation forces are still there.

The "Daily Telegraph" editorial on the 26th said that there is no doubt that the large-scale uprising of the South Korean people "must be seen as a striking indictment of the (US) Republican Party's foreign policy." The editorial pointed out that the "extreme unpopularity of the US-backed regime" of the Syngman Rhee group has put the United States in an "awkward position."

An earlier article in "The Scotsman" said: "The South Korean people's indignation has finally erupted, effectively turning America's 'democratic showcase' in the Far East into a pile of broken glass."

"The Tribune" and "The Spectator" pointed out that the United States should be held responsible for the bloodshed in South Korea.

Lavigne, editor-in-chief of the French "L'Humanité," who had visited Korea, wrote in "L'Humanité" that the US authorities' dollars and modern weapons could not help the Syngman Rhee group maintain its rule in South Korea.

The Austrian Communist Party's newspaper "Austrian People's Voice" emphasized in an editorial on the 21st that the South Korean people's struggle against Syngman Rhee's rule "is part of the entire movement for liberation from colonialism (rule). This movement will be victorious in South Korea, just as it has been victorious in other Asian and African countries."

    世界舆论热烈支持南朝鲜人民斗争
    要求让南朝鲜人民自己决定自己命运　不许任何外国进行干涉
    英国报纸说：美国在远东的“民主橱窗”已经成为一堆破玻璃
    本报综合报道　社会主义国家、亚洲和欧洲各国舆论热烈支持南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的英勇斗争。
    塔斯社评论员哈里科夫26日就南朝鲜人民反抗李承晚傀儡统治的英勇斗争写道，南朝鲜的事件说明了这样一个真理，即坦克和机关枪压制不了人民的愤怒。
    评论员写道，李承晚的十二年统治把南朝鲜变成了极端贫困和人民无权的地区。但是，这完全符合于支持李承晚的美国集团的愿望。而美国在推行使朝鲜处于民族分裂状态并把南朝鲜变成美国的军事基地的政策中，也正是把赌注下在李承晚的身上。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会24日发表声明，支持南朝鲜人民反对美国—李承晚集团的斗争。
    声明说，越南祖国战线中央委员会代表全体越南人民，要求立即制止美帝国主义和李承晚集团对南朝鲜人民的野蛮镇压，实现和保证南朝鲜人民的民主自由权利，要求美国军队立即撤出南朝鲜，让南朝鲜人民自己决定自己的命运，不许任何外国加以干涉，要求进行全国的自由普选来和平统一朝鲜。
    越南“人民报”在27日的评论中指出，目前，在南朝鲜的法西斯制度，正是美国制造的产品，所有大权都由美国掌握。南朝鲜人民反对李承晚制度的斗争，正是反对美帝国主义的奴役制度的斗争。南朝鲜人民经过十五年的痛苦生活，日益认清了只有把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜和肃清它的一切走狗，南朝鲜才能获得自由、民主和幸福生活，朝鲜民族才能团聚。
    蒙古人民共和国“劳动报”19日发表评论说，李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义的扶植下镇压人民的企图，是不会得逞的。人民的意志是强大的力量，军队和武器动摇不了人民斗争意志。评论说，蒙古劳动人民完全同情和支持南朝鲜人民的斗争。
    罗马尼亚“保卫祖国报”27日的评论说，李承晚的垮台不仅仅是南朝鲜反动政权的失败，也是一切帝国主义的失败。帝国主义的“实力政策”遭到了可耻的破产。刺刀和骗人的伎俩都不能阻止人民的斗争，不能改变历史前进的道路。
    评论最后说，李承晚垮台后，南朝鲜的爱国志士并没有结束斗争，而是使斗争进入一个新的阶段。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”28日以“独裁者的下台”为题发表评论说，从汉城传来了关于李承晚下台并宣布3月份的大选无效等消息，这是南朝鲜人民在艰难的斗争道路上所取得的一个不小的胜利。
    评论说，南朝鲜人民的斗争在全世界激起特别强烈的反响。它使人们更清楚地看到：美国所支持和粉饰的是什么人。
    评论指出，朝鲜劳动党中央发出的告南朝鲜人民书中号召南北朝鲜进行会谈、结束祖国分裂的呼吁，在南朝鲜当前情况下有着特别重大的意义。南北朝鲜人的共同会谈是使南朝鲜人民英勇斗争的果实不会被剥夺的唯一保证。
    日本和平委员会、日朝协会等八个团体25日晚在东京联合举行集会，声援南朝鲜人民的斗争。参加这次集会的有平野义太郎、风见章、大山柳子等各界著名人士。会议指出要展开宣传活动，使日本人民进一步认识南朝鲜人民的斗争。
    日本和平委员会等七个群众团体27日发表声明，表示支持南朝鲜人民起来反对李承晚集团和反对美军占领的斗争。声明要求美国从南朝鲜撤军，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。
    这七个团体将在5月23日联合举行大会，表示日本人民支持南朝鲜人民的斗争。
    印度尼西亚“黎明日报”说，南朝鲜人民反对李承晚，也就是反对美国。这家报纸指出，在李承晚集团统治南朝鲜期间，爆发了朝鲜战争，使成千上万人民死亡，今天南朝鲜仍然被美国军队占领着。南朝鲜人民对于李承晚的政策是不满意的。
    柬埔寨“友谊报”在评论中揭露美国打算换一个新的人来继续欺骗朝鲜人民。评论说，“南朝鲜的局势向我们说明，不管反动势力多么强大，决不能维持长久，这种情况迟早会改变”。
    刚访问过汉城的菲律宾通讯社社长巴尔多麦罗·奥利维拉在4月20日说，“李承晚的人采取的强暴策略必然会导致暴动。”他说，南朝鲜人民受够了李承晚的独裁手段和李承晚集团各级官员猖獗的贪污行为。
    英国“工人日报”28日发表社论，要求美国占领军撤出南朝鲜。
    社论说：“李承晚的腐朽残暴和依靠美国作后盾的政权正在垮台。但是，违反大多数人民的意志而支撑李承晚当政的外国步兵、坦克和飞机仍然留在南朝鲜。
    社论指出：“虽然李承晚不得不退位，但是南朝鲜人民并没有取得自由。由于美国占领军仍留在那里，他们要取得自由就有很大困难。
    “每日电讯报”26日的社论说，毫无疑问，南朝鲜人民的大规模起义“必须看作对（美国）共和党的对外政策一个引人注目的控诉”。社论指出，李承晚集团这个“美国扶植的政权的极度不得人心”已经使美国陷入“尴尬的局面”。
    “苏格兰人报”早些时候发表的一篇文章说：“南朝鲜人民的愤慨终于爆发了，实际上，这使美国在远东的‘民主橱窗’变成一堆破玻璃。”
    “论坛”周刊和“旁观者”周刊指出，美国应当对南朝鲜的流血事件负责。
    曾访问过朝鲜的法国“人道报”总编辑部的拉维涅在“人道报”上写文章指出，美国当局的美元和现代化武器也帮助不了李承晚集团维持它在南朝鲜的统治。
    奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”21日在社论中强调指出，南朝鲜人民反抗李承晚统治的斗争，“是整个从殖民主义（统治）下争取解放的运动的一部分。这个运动将在南朝鲜取得胜利，正如它在其他亚非国家中已经取得胜利一样”。
