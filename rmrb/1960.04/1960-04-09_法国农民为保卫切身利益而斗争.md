French Farmers Fight to Defend Their Interests

Disregarding the authorities' suppression, French farmers have continuously engaged in struggles in recent months against the agricultural policies of the De Gaulle government. These policies have brought them immense harm.

When the so-called "referendum" was held in September 1958, De Gaulle, in order to pave the way for establishing a personal dictatorship, deceived the farmers by saying that the French government must implement an agricultural policy that could guarantee their interests. But subsequent facts proved that this was nothing but a lie. The basic living conditions of French farmers not only did not improve but worsened.

The agricultural population in France is over ten million, accounting for more than 25% of the total population. The concentration of land is extremely high. Small farmers (those with less than ten hectares of land) account for 58% of the total number of farm households but only occupy one-sixth of the land, while large landowners, who account for 4% of the total number of farm households, own one-third of the country's land. Soon after De Gaulle came to power, the French government implemented a series of decrees that harmed the interests of farmers. For example, lowering the prices of agricultural products, reducing subsidies for purchasing agricultural materials, reducing agricultural equipment funding, increasing fertilizer taxes, increasing taxes on wine and other agricultural products, and increasing various rents. These policies have brought great benefits to agricultural capitalists and landlords. According to estimates by the French Ministry of Agriculture last year, the profits of French private agricultural enterprises increased by 238 billion old francs in 1958 compared to 1957, and would increase by another 40 billion old francs in 1959. However, the situation of French agricultural workers is deteriorating. Since January 1959, according to official French figures, the prices of industrial products needed for agriculture have increased by 10%, while the farm prices of agricultural products have decreased by 11%; the wages of agricultural workers are even 25% lower than those of industrial workers. This scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products has caused great damage to French farmers.

In the 1960 national budget passed by the French National Assembly, military spending accounted for 32% of the total expenditure, while agricultural expenditure only accounted for 1.8%.

The above facts have made French farmers see through the deceptive nature of De Gaulle's "promises." Therefore, they resolutely use actions to protest against the De Gaulle government's reactionary policies, which serve monopoly capital by sacrificing the interests of small and medium-sized farmers, and demand to improve their living conditions.

    法国农民为保卫切身利益而斗争
    法国农民不顾当局的镇压，最近几个月来连续不断地进行了反对戴高乐政府农业政策的斗争。这个政策已给他们带来了极大的危害。
    当1958年9月举行所谓“公民投票”时，戴高乐为了打开建立个人独裁的道路，曾经欺骗过农民，说什么法国政府一定要实行一种能够保障农民利益的农业政策。但是以后的事实却证明这不过是谎言而已。法国农民生活的基本状况不但毫无改善，反而更加恶化。
    法国的农业人口有一千多万，占人口总数25％以上。土地集中程度极高，占农户总数58％的小农户（占地十公顷以下者）只占六分之一的土地，而占农户总数4％的大地主却占有全国三分之一的土地。戴高乐执政后不久，法国政府就执行了一系列损害农民利益的法令。例如降低农产品的价格，减少购买农业物资的补贴，减少农业设备经费，提高肥料税额，增加酒和其他农产品的税收，增加各种各样的租金等等。这种政策给农业资本家和地主们带来了很大的好处。据法国农业部去年估计，法国的私人农业企业利润在1958年比1957年增加二千三百八十亿旧法郎，而1959年还得再增加四百多亿旧法郎，而法国农业劳动者的处境却日益恶化。从1959年1月以来，按照法国官方数字，农业所需的工业产品价格提高了10％，而农产品的产地价格却下降11％；农业工人的工资甚至比工业工人低25％。这种工农业产品价格的剪刀差，使法国农民遭到了很大的损害。
    法国国民议会通过的1960年国家预算中，军事拨款占整个支出的32％，农业开支却只占1.8％。
    以上这些事实，已经使法国农民看清了戴高乐“诺言”的欺骗性，因此，他们就坚决用行动来抗议戴高乐政府以牺牲中小农民利益来为垄断资本服务的反动政策，要求改善自己的生活条件。
