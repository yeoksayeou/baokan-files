Esteemed Speakers and Members of Parliament:

　　After an interval of three years, I am once again able to come to our close neighbor, Nepal, for a friendly visit, and I am honored and delighted to have the opportunity to meet with the esteemed members of both houses of the Nepalese Parliament in a joint session. I sincerely thank Prime Minister Koirala for his kind invitation and the gracious hospitality of His Majesty the King of Nepal's government, and I thank the Speakers for giving me the opportunity to speak on this esteemed platform, and thank you all for the warm welcome to me and my colleagues. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese people, to extend cordial greetings to the Nepalese people and express our most friendly wishes.

　　China and Nepal are both ancient and young countries. Our two peoples have a long and profound traditional friendship. Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, we have not only restored the friendly ties that were once interrupted between our two countries, but also established new good-neighborly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the past few years, our two countries have consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and have unremittingly maintained our friendship. Recently, with the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on the Boundary Question and the Sino-Nepalese Economic Assistance Agreement, the friendly and cooperative relations between us have entered a new stage. We can say without exaggeration that, thanks to the joint efforts of our two governments and peoples, we have set an example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in our bilateral relations.

　　Both China and Nepal face the arduous task of building their own countries. We deeply understand that only when our Asian and African countries are economically independent can we enrich the content of political independence and thoroughly guarantee our independence. So far, our two countries are still economically backward, and we lack experience in construction. This objective fact determines that it is necessary for us to help each other and strengthen cooperation in economic construction. The development of the national economy of any Asian or African country is itself an encouragement and support for other Asian and African countries. The Chinese people are strengthening economic cooperation with Asian and African countries in this spirit. We sincerely hope that Nepal can prosper and become strong very soon. Like other Asian and African countries, Nepal's prosperity and strength is a strong support for our China.

　　China and Nepal are both peace-loving countries and countries that love independence and freedom. The Chinese people have solemnly expressed their wishes in the legal provisions of their own constitution: "In international affairs, our firm and unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress." We are pleased to see that the movement against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is continuing to surge, and new countries are emerging one after another. Due to the widespread upsurge of national independence movements and the unremitting efforts of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the international situation has eased to a certain extent. The forces striving for lasting world peace have become so strong that even Western countries have had to make some gestures of relaxation. It can be said that the prospect of striving for world peace has never been as favorable as it is today, which is gratifying to our two peoples and all peace-loving people in the world. However, we must also see that while flaunting peace, the imperialist aggressive groups are stepping up their arms expansion and war preparations, continuing to organize military alliances, establish military bases, and strengthen military blocs, and are doing their utmost to prevent the East and West from reaching agreements on major international issues. It is particularly noteworthy that, with the support of imperialist aggressive groups, the militarist forces that once launched world wars are reviving, once again threatening world peace and security. All these circumstances show that maintaining world peace remains an arduous task. It is necessary for all peace-loving countries and people in the world to further strengthen unity and make greater efforts to continue their efforts.

　　His Majesty the King of Nepal's government has stated many times that His Majesty the King of Nepal's government has decided to adopt an independent neutral policy, not to participate in any military bloc and resolutely implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government and people warmly welcome and

    中尼两国友好关系树立了和平共处的榜样
    周恩来总理4月28日在尼泊尔议会上的讲话尊敬的议长先生们和议员先生们：
    在相隔三年之后，我能够再一次来到我们亲密的邻邦尼泊尔进行友好访问，并且有机会在尼泊尔议会上下两院联席会议上同尊敬的议员先生们见面，感到十分荣幸和高兴。我衷心地感谢柯伊拉腊首相阁下的盛情邀请和尼泊尔国王陛下政府的殷情款待，感谢议长先生们给我在这个崇高的讲坛上讲话的机会，感谢大家对我和我的同事们的热烈欢迎。我愿借这个机会，代表中国人民向尼泊尔人民致以亲切的问候，并且表示最友好的祝愿。
    中国和尼泊尔是两个古老而又年轻的国家。我们两国人民之间有着悠久、深厚的传统友谊。自从我们两国正式建立外交关系以后，我们不仅恢复了两国之间一度中断的友好联系，而且在和平共处五项原则的基础上，建立了新的睦邻关系。几年来，我们两国始终不渝地坚持和平共处的五项原则，不懈地维护着我们之间的友谊。最近，由于中尼关于两国边界问题的协定和中尼两国经济援助协定的签订，我们之间的友好合作关系进入了一个新的阶段。我们可以毫不夸张地说，由于我们两国政府和人民的共同努力，我们在两国关系上，已经树立了不同社会制度国家和平共处的榜样。
    中国和尼泊尔都面临着建设自己国家的艰巨任务。我们深深懂得，我们亚非国家只有经济上独立了，才能充实政治独立的内容，彻底保障我们的独立。到目前为止，我们两国在经济上还是落后的，我们缺乏进行建设的经验。这个客观存在的事实，决定了我们在经济建设中有必要互相帮助，加强合作。亚非国家中任何一个国家的民族经济发展本身就是对于另外一些亚非国家的鼓舞和支持。中国人民就是本着这种精神来加强同亚非国家的经济合作的。我们真诚地希望尼泊尔能够很快地繁荣富强起来。像其他亚非国家一样，尼泊尔的繁荣富强就是对于我们中国有力的支持。
    中国和尼泊尔都是爱好和平的国家，都是热爱独立自由的国家。中国人民在自己的宪法中，用法律的条文庄严地表示了他们的愿望：“在国际事务中，我们坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”我们高兴地看到，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的运动正在继续高涨，新国家一个接着一个地出现。由于民族独立运动的普遍高涨，由于全世界爱好和平的国家和人民坚持不懈的努力，国际形势出现了一定程度的缓和。争取世界持久和平的力量已经如此强大，连西方国家也不得不作出某些和缓的表示。可以说，争取世界和平的前景从来没有像今天这样有利，这是我们两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都感到欢欣鼓舞的。但是，我们也要看到，帝国主义侵略集团在标榜和平的同时，正在加紧扩军备战，继续组织军事同盟、建立军事基地和加强军事集团，并且竭力阻挠东西方就重大国际问题达成协议。特别值得注意的是，在帝国主义侵略集团的扶植下，曾经发动过世界大战的军国主义势力正在复活，重新威胁着世界和平和安全。所有这些情况说明，维护世界和平仍然是一个艰巨的任务。全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民有必要进一步加强团结、再接再厉地作出更大的努力。
    尼泊尔国王陛下政府曾经多次声明，尼泊尔国王陛下政府决定采取独立的中立政策，不参加任何军事集团，并且坚决执行和平共处的五项原则。中国政府和人民热烈欢迎并且完全支持尼泊尔国王陛下政府的这一政策。这一政策不但有利于尼泊尔的和平发展，有利于尼泊尔五年经济建设计划的顺利执行，而且也有利于维护亚洲国家团结和巩固世界和平的崇高事业。中国政府和人民愿意同尼泊尔国王陛下政府和人民进一步加强团结，继续为维护世界和平，促进亚非国家间的团结和友好合作而共同努力。
    在我将要结束我的讲话的时候，我愿再一次表示我们的衷心谢意，感谢你们的欢迎，感谢尼泊尔国王陛下政府的款待。
    中尼友好万岁！
    亚非国家的团结和世界和平万岁！
