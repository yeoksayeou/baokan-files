Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 22nd: The newly built Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge has officially opened to traffic. On the morning of the 21st, thousands of bridge construction workers and representatives from all walks of life in Henan Province and Zhengzhou City gathered at the bridgehead to hold a grand opening ceremony.

	On this day, the sky was clear and flags were flying, making the rainbow spanning the Yellow River's torrents appear exceptionally majestic and spectacular. Wang Weiqun, member of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Governor of Henan Province, and Director of the State Acceptance Committee; Xing Zhaotang and Li Qingwei, Vice Governors of Henan Province; Niu Wanli, Secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Zhang Beichen and Li Ping, Vice Mayors of Zhengzhou City; Peng Min, Director of the Bridge Engineering Bureau; Lin Shibo, Chief Engineer of the Basic Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways; and Hu Yiping, Acting Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, all participated in the conference.

	At 10:00 a.m., the ceremony began, and Wang Weiqun spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the State Acceptance Committee, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Provincial People's Committee, he extended cordial greetings and warm congratulations to all the workers who participated in the construction of the bridge. He said that the rapid completion of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge marks a new stage in the advancement of China's bridge industry technology, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the tremendous power of the General Line. The completion and opening of this bridge will greatly promote the development of the North-South railway trunk line in our country and realize the long-cherished wish of the people of the whole country to rebuild a new bridge. This was unimaginable in the past, and only under the leadership of the Party can this ideal become a reality.

	Niu Wanli, Peng Min, Lin Shibo, Hu Yiping, and Qin Hongfa, a representative of the bridge construction workers, also spoke at the meeting successively. After the speeches, Wang Weiqun cut the ribbon to open the bridge to traffic amidst the sound of firecrackers.

	The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is the largest permanent double-track railway bridge built by China's bridge construction team on the Yellow River after the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, under the leadership of the Party. This bridge is nearly three kilometers long and was entirely designed and built by our country. After the bridge started construction in May 1958, the builders, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, fully demonstrated their daring and capable style, successfully applied and developed the construction method of pipe pile foundations of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and created a set of advanced bridge construction experiences, such as sinking giant pipe piles in the Yellow River, through vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution. Therefore, the completion of this bridge was guaranteed six months ahead of the national plan. In the process of building the bridge, the bridge-building technical team was further strengthened and expanded, and practical experience in bridge construction was gained, especially under the special geological and hydrological conditions of the Yellow River, which laid a favorable foundation for building new bridges on the Yellow River in the future.

	After this bridge opens to traffic, it can not only greatly improve the transportation capacity of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, but also greatly improve the transportation capacity of the Longhai Line. In the past, although there was an old Yellow River Bridge here, its single-track design meant that its passing capacity could not meet the needs of today's high-speed development of the national economy. In the past, trains loaded with steel, coal, machinery, and other materials were often crowded on both sides of the bridge, waiting to give way to other trains. With the opening of this bridge, this situation will quickly change. (Attached picture)

### 郑州黄河新大桥通车  建桥职工和各界代表举行隆重通车典礼

    郑州黄河新大桥通车
    建桥职工和各界代表举行隆重通车典礼
    新华社郑州22日电　新建郑州黄河大桥已经正式通车。21日上午，数千建桥职工和河南省、郑州市各界代表，汇集在桥头，举行了隆重的通车典礼。
    这一天，晴空万里，彩旗飘扬，横跨黄河激流的长虹显得分外巍峨壮观。中共河南省委委员、河南省副省长、国家验收委员会主任王维群，河南省副省长邢肇棠、李庆伟，中共郑州市委书记牛万里、郑州市副市长张北辰、李平，大桥工程局局长彭敏，铁道部基本建设总局总工程师林诗伯和郑州铁路局代理局长胡逸平等，都参加了大会。
    上午十时，典礼开始，王维群在大会上讲了话。他代表国家验收委员会、中共河南省委、省人民委员会，向参加大桥建设的全体职工致以亲切的慰问和热烈的祝贺。他说，郑州黄河大桥的迅速建成，标志着我国桥梁工业技术已经跃进到一个新的阶段，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性和总路线的巨大威力。这座大桥的建成和通车，大大促进了我国南北铁路干线的交通事业的发展，实现了全国人民多年来重建新桥的愿望。这在过去是不可想像的，只有在党的领导下，这种理想才能变成现实。
    牛万里、彭敏、林诗伯、胡逸平和建桥职工代表秦洪发等，都先后在大会上讲了话。讲话后，王维群在鞭炮轰鸣声中剪彩通车。
    郑州黄河大桥是我国桥梁队伍在党的领导下，继武汉长江大桥之后，在黄河上建成的最大一座永久性的铁路复线桥。这座大桥长近三公里，全部是由我国自己设计和修建的。大桥在1958年5月动工兴建后，建设者们在总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发挥了敢想敢干的风格，成功地运用和发展了武汉长江大桥管柱基础的施工方法，并且通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，创造了在黄河中下沉巨型管柱等一套建桥先进经验。因此保证了比国家计划提前半年建成这座大桥。在建桥过程中，进一步锻炼壮大了建桥技术队伍，特别是在黄河这种特殊的地质、水文条件下，获得了建桥的实际经验，为今后在黄河上建设新的大桥打下了有利的基础。
    这座大桥通车后，不仅可以大大提高京广铁路的运输能力，而且，对于提高陇海干线运输能力也有很大作用。过去，这里虽有一座黄河老桥，但是由于它是一座单线桥，通过能力远远不能适应今天国民经济高速度发展的需要。过去经常有满载钢铁、煤炭、机械等物资的列车，拥挤在桥头两岸等待让车。随着这座大桥的通车，就会迅速改变这种状况。（附图片）
