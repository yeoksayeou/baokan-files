I completely agree with the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the Standing Committee.

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," I was infinitely encouraged and excited. Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the correct guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, our motherland continued to achieve a great leap forward in the national economy in 1959 and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We have also put forward a plan for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 and a national budget adapted to the vigorous development of the national economy, so that we can see that by successfully realizing this plan, we may strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1957 ahead of schedule.

The report pointed out: The people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. In order to continuously give play to the enthusiasm of the people, since 1957, we have further "resolutely carried out the socialist revolution comprehensively from the economic, political, and ideological aspects, resolutely and continuously eliminated the various influences left over from the old society, broken all kinds of superstitions, and liberated people from all aspects. This is an important reason for the new situation of the great leap forward in 1958, which has never been seen in history." Vice Chairman Chen's report also asked us to actively serve and strengthen transformation. I would like to talk about my thoughts on the further implementation of the Party's education policy and technical policy in the past two years, which has powerfully promoted the self-transformation of intellectuals.

Since the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward, intellectuals in general have made considerable progress from different starting points. This is mainly due to the wise and correct leadership of the Party, the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and other fronts in the country, and the continued dominance of the East Wind over the West Wind internationally, which has promoted the gradual improvement of the intellectuals' consciousness. Especially in the education revolution and technological revolution movement led by the Party, the mass line was implemented, which not only innovated education and technology in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, but also transformed the intellectuals more thoroughly, liberating them from their self-enclosed special status, placing themselves among the masses, and marching towards the broad road of laborization. This is the victory of the Party's education policy and technical policy, and the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

In capitalist society, intellectuals, especially so-called senior intellectuals, including professors and researchers in universities and scientific research units, have a special status. They have specialized knowledge, have a so-called professorial style, and are different from ordinary intellectuals. They have the privilege of giving lectures, the privilege of writing books and making statements, and the privilege of selecting research topics. It is generally believed that young assistant teachers cannot independently teach courses within three years and cannot independently conduct scientific research within five years, which has almost become a system. Precisely because they each have expertise and are superior to others, they are generally accustomed to working alone and do not seek each other's advice. In capitalist society, intellectuals often use these privileges as their protective talismans, considering themselves extraordinary and becoming a special class.

The situation was the same before the liberation of our country. Intellectuals were infected with this kind of atmosphere, and after liberation, it was difficult to change their inertia for a while, and it still had a great impact. This bad atmosphere not only hinders the self-transformation of senior intellectuals, but also harms young intellectuals, hindering their development in various ways, which is really harmful. It was not until 1958, on the basis of the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, that the Party called for further implementation of the education revolution and technological revolution, instructed us to break superstitions, emancipate our minds, promote the communist style of daring to think and act, and launched a vigorous mass movement to carry out socialist appraisal and competition, which created a vigorous new situation in education and scientific research, showing the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

First of all, in terms of teacher training, through planned and targeted training, collective lesson preparation, and collective trial lectures, assistant teachers with less than three years of teaching experience can also teach courses and achieve good teaching results. Not only that, but young lecturers often open new courses that professors are unwilling or unable to teach through collective efforts, and reach a considerable level. This proves that teacher training through the implementation of the mass line can be carried out in large quantities, quickly, and with high quality. Only in this way can we train teachers in a more, faster, better, and more economical way to meet the current needs of high-speed development of education, technological innovation, and socialist construction. Compared with the past situation where newly appointed assistant teachers could only take on experiments and internships, and were allowed to grow freely with little attention, the results are very different.

In terms of compiling teaching materials and scientific research, through the implementation of the mass line under the leadership of the Party, the method of combining teachers and students or old and young researchers and skilled workers can be carried out at high speed and high quality can be obtained at the same time. At present, the compilation of teaching materials is not only carried out by teachers and students within the school, but also inter-school cooperation is carried out. With a large number of people, great strength, fast progress, and high quality, cooperative compilation of teaching materials has become a trend. As far as Shenyang Agricultural College, where I work, is concerned, since the beginning of 1959, under the leadership of the Party committee, teachers and students have combined and cooperated with colleges and universities in Northeast China to compile teaching materials on a large scale. From the revision of the teaching syllabus to the collective review and finalization, about 120 kinds of teaching materials will be completed by this year's National Day, of which more than 40 kinds belong to the cooperative compilation in Northeast China, and all the first drafts will be completed. According to the current situation, 35 kinds of teaching materials have reached the publishing level and are scheduled to be published by the state publishing house, and some are already being printed. Most of these teaching materials are compiled by young teachers, and senior students can play a great role in assisting in collecting materials, initially sorting out materials, drawing charts, and especially in reviewing the first draft. In less than two years, such a large workload can be completed, of which about 30% has reached the publishing level, which is incomparable to the past individual work, limited strength, long time, and low quality.

Scientific research is no longer the exclusive work of intellectuals, let alone the patent of a few senior intellectuals. Workers and peasants directly engaged in production all have a share. Through carrying out technological revolution on a large scale and carrying out high-yield experiments on a large scale, a large number of scientific achievements have been created, a large number of worker-peasant scientists have emerged, and a great situation of prosperity has been formed. As far as the soil science I am familiar with is concerned, the peasants participated in the soil survey and identification work, put forward the evolution law of soil fertility, and came up with a complete set of technical measures for deep plowing and soil improvement and soil-based fertilization. The peasants also created unprecedented high yields of various crops. The yield of rice per mu of one thousand catties was created by the peasants. It is currently being promoted on large areas of thousands of acres. The small-area test is already striving for the goal of more than two thousand catties per mu. All of this was unimaginable to us two years ago, but now it is all a fact.

Due to the high level of collective strength, young teachers and researchers, the broad masses of workers and peasants, can all make excellent achievements. Young students can also assist teachers in compiling teaching materials and can also carry out scientific research and achieve outstanding results. Unprecedented miracles have appeared in teaching and scientific research, thus prompting older teachers and researchers to raise their awareness in the movement to carry out education revolution and technological revolution on a large scale along with the above-mentioned reality. In general, not only have they played their due role, but they have also played a greater role because they can closely integrate with the masses, and through their work, they have increased their feelings for the Party and the socialist cause. All of this is under the brilliant light of the Party's general line. Carrying out mass movements on a large scale has created both high-speed and high-quality development in education and technology, and has promoted the rich achievements of intellectuals in actively serving and strengthening transformation.

At present, the education revolution and technological revolution are being carried out in depth. The socialist appraisal and competition applicable to factories and farms are also applicable to schools at all levels. For example, some colleges and universities in Liaoning Province have developed the past observation teaching into teaching performances, competing with each other. Collective help is carried out in advance, and the teaching effect is evaluated afterward, including the evaluation of all aspects of teaching materials and teaching methods, which promotes the rapid improvement of teaching quality. Through teaching performances and evaluations, it is possible that the same content, if expressed properly, can both shorten the teaching time and improve the teaching effect, thus leading to great improvements in teaching and even the education system. This is a further implementation of the mass line in teaching work, which is currently being tested and promoted in various colleges and universities in Liaoning Province in combination with specific circumstances. This sweeps away the past erroneous view that teaching methods are different and cannot be evaluated using general competition methods. Appraisal and competition are one of the important methods to promote work. Why can't it be applied to intellectuals? In fact, through appraisal and competition, one's own teaching quality and effect can be greatly improved. As long as attention is paid to combining specific circumstances in the implementation of the method, it has only advantages and no disadvantages.

It must be pointed out that the education revolution and the technological revolution are only in their initial stages, and are waiting for the full mobilization of the masses to give full play to the collective strength, and to be promoted more comprehensively, deeply, and thoroughly, and intellectuals must be more closely integrated with the masses. In the future, even more brilliant achievements will be obtained.

In general, under the leadership of the Party, with the in-depth development of the education revolution and the technological revolution, and the in-depth implementation of the mass line, as long as intellectuals do not miss the special status of being self-enclosed and completely liberate themselves and plunge into the mass movement of thousands of horses galloping, it is possible to play a greater role and at the same time increase their feelings for the Party and the socialist cause. At present, the booming situation of socialist construction in the motherland is both conducive to our self-transformation and requires us to constantly improve the consciousness of transformation. We should recognize this favorable situation, actively serve, strengthen transformation, and leap forward closely with the times.

    认清形势　积极服务　加强改造
    陈恩凤委员的发言
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作常务委员会的工作报告。
    当我听了李富春副总理所作“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”后，得到无限的鼓舞，感到无限的兴奋。我们的祖国在伟大的中国共产党的英明领导下、在伟大的毛泽东思想的正确指导下，通过全国人民的共同努力，在1959年继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标；又提出了1960年国民经济继续跃进的计划和与大力发展国民经济相适应的国家预算，使我们看到胜利地实现这个计划，我们就可能争取用比十年更少的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，并且提前实现1956年至1957年全国农业发展纲要。
    报告中指出：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素，为了不断地发挥人民群众的积极性，所以从1957年以来，进一步“坚决地从经济上、政治上、思想上全面地进行社会主义革命，坚决地不断地肃清旧社会遗留下来的各种影响，破除各色各样的迷信，把人从各方面解放出来，这是一九五八年开创历史上从来没有过的大跃进的新局面的重要原因。”陈副主席报告中也要求我们积极服务，加强改造。我想就两年来进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针与技术方针，有力地促进了知识分子的自我改造方面，谈谈我的感想。
    从整风、反右、大跃进以来，一般知识分子都能从不同的出发点有了相当大的进步，这主要是由于党的英明正确领导，在国内出现了工农业生产以及其他各个战线上连续的大跃进，而在国际间东风继续压倒西风，促使知识分子的自觉性逐步提高而获得的。尤其是在党所领导的大搞教育革命与技术革命运动中，贯彻群众路线，不仅多快好省地革新了教育与技术，同时也比较彻底地改造了知识分子，使知识分子从故步自封的特殊地位中解放出来，置身于群众之中，向着劳动化的康庄大道迈进。这是党的教育方针、技术方针的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。
    在资本主义社会中，知识分子尤其是所谓高级知识分子，包括高等学校和科学研究单位中的教授和研究员具有特殊地位。他们学有专长，具有所谓教授风格，又不同于一般知识分子，他们有开课讲学的特权，有著书立说的特权，有选题研究的特权，而一般认为青年助教三年以内不能独立开课，五年以内不能独立进行科学研究，几乎相沿成为一种制度。正因为他们各有专长，地位高人一等，所以一般都习惯于各自单干，相互之间不相为谋。在资本主义社会中知识分子常用这些特权作为他们的护身符，自命不凡，成为特殊阶层。
    我国解放以前也是如此，知识分子染上这样风气，到了解放以后，一时惰性难改，仍然影响很大。这种不良风气不仅阻碍高级知识分子的自我改造，同时贻害青年知识分子，在种种方面妨碍他们的发展，真是为害不浅。一直到了1958年以来，在整风反右的基础上，党号召进一步贯彻教育革命与技术革命，指示我们破除迷信，解放思想，提倡敢想敢干的共产主义风格，掀起轰轰烈烈的群众运动，大搞社会主义评比竞赛，这才在教育与科学研究方面出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新局面，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    首先在师资培养方面，通过有计划的定向培养、集体备课、集体试讲，会使教龄三年以内的助教也能开课，并且获得良好的教学效果。不仅如此，青年讲师往往通过集体力量开出教授不愿或不能担任的新课，而且达到相当的水平。证明了师资培养通过贯彻群众路线，能够大量地、快速地、高质地进行培养，也只有这样多快好省地培养师资才能满足目前高速度发展教育、革新技术、建设社会主义的需要。这与过去新任助教只能担任实验实习，听其自由成长，少人过问的少慢差费情况相比，收到大不相同的效果。
    在编写教材和科学研究方面，通过在党的领导下贯彻群众路线，采用教师学生或年老年青研究人员以及生产能手的三结合办法，能够高速度的进行，同时还能获得高质量。目前在编写教材方面不仅由校内师生合力进行，同时还开展校际间协作进行，人数多、力量大、进度快、质量高，因而协作编写教材已经成为风气。就我所服务的单位沈阳农学院而言，自从1959年初在党委领导下，师生结合并且与东北区高等院校协作大编教材，从重新修订教学大纲起，到集体审查定稿止，到今年国庆将完成约一百二十种教材的编写任务，其中属东北区协作编写的四十多种，全部初稿就要完成，根据目前情况，已有三十五种教材达到出版水平，定由国家出版社出版，有的已在付印中。其中大部分教材是由青年教师编写的，而高年级学生在协助搜集材料、初步整理材料、绘制图表，尤其是在审查初稿中都能发挥很大的作用。不到两年的时间能够完成这样大的工作量，其中约有30％达到出版水平，较之过去个人单干，力量有限，费时既长，质量不高，真是不可比拟。
    科学研究不再是知识分子的特有工作，更不是少数高级知识分子的专利，直接从事生产的工人农民都有份。通过大搞技术革命，大搞丰产试验，创造了大量的科学成果，出现了大批的工人农民科学家，形成了万紫千红欣欣向荣的伟大局面。就我所熟悉的土壤科学而言，农民参加了土壤普查和鉴定工作，提出了土壤肥力的演变规律，搞出成套的深耕改土和看土施肥的技术措施，农民还创造出前所未有的多种农作物的高额单产，亩产千斤水稻是农民创造的，目前已在成千成万亩的大片土地上推行，小区试验已经向亩产二千斤以上的目标奋斗，这在二年以前都是我们难以想像的事，而目前都是事实。
    由于集体力量的高度发挥，青年的教师和研究人员、广大的工人、农民群众，都能作出优异的成绩，青年学生也能协助教师编写教材，又能进行科学研究，并且取得出色的成绩，在教学与科学研究中出现了前所未有的奇迹，因而促使年老教师和研究人员在大搞教育革命与技术革命运动中，随着上述的现实提高了自觉性，一般不仅发挥了应有的作用，还因能与群众密切结合从而发挥了更大的作用，并且通过工作增加了自己对党对社会主义事业的感情。这都是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，大搞群众运动，一方创造了教育与技术既是高速度又是高质量的发展，一方推动了知识分子积极服务加强改造的丰盛成就。
    目前教育革命与技术革命正在深入开展，适用于工厂农场的社会主义评比竞赛，同样适用于各级学校，像辽宁省的高等学校中有的已经把过去的观摩教学发展成为教学表演，互相竞赛，事先经过集体帮助，事后评比教学效果，包括教材教法各个环节的评比，促使教学质量迅速提高。通过教学表演与评比，会使同样的内容如果表达得宜，很可能一方既能缩短教学时间，一方还能提高教学效果，因而导致教学以至教育体制的巨大改进。这正是群众路线在教学工作中进一步的贯彻，目前正在辽宁省各高等学校中结合具体情况试验推行。这就一扫过去教学方法各有一套，不能采用一般竞赛办法进行评比的错误看法。评比竞赛是促进工作的重要方法之一，为什么不能适用于知识分子呢？事实上通过评比竞赛能够大大地提高自己的教学质量与效果，只要在方法上注意结合具体情况加以贯彻是有百利而无一弊的。
    必须指出，教育革命与技术革命还只是初步开展，正有待于充分发动群众高度的发挥集体力量，更全面地深入地彻底地加以推进，而知识分子要与群众更紧密的结合起来。今后必将获得更为辉煌的成就。
    总的看来，知识分子在党的领导下，随着教育革命与技术革命的深入开展，群众路线的深入贯彻，只要不留恋故步自封的特殊地位把自己彻底解放出来，投入到万马奔腾的群众运动中去，就有可能发挥更大的作用，同时也能增加自己对党对社会主义事业的感情。目前祖国社会主义建设蓬勃发展的形势，一方有利于我们的自我改造，一方又要求我们不断提高改造的自觉性，我们应当认清这样有利的形势，积极服务，加强改造，紧紧随着时代向前跃进。
