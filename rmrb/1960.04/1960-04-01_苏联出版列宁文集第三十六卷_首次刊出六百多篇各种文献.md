    Soviet Union Publishes Volume 36 of Lenin's Collected Works
    Over Six Hundred Various Documents Published for the First Time

    Recently, Volume 36 of Lenin's Collected Works was published in the Soviet Union. It contains 636 various documents written by Lenin between 1917 and 1923, published for the first time. These include letters, notes, short comments, articles, drafts of speeches and resolutions, telegrams, and more.

    This volume, published by the Political Literature Publishing House, includes Lenin's letter to Lutovinov, one of the leaders of the so-called "Workers' Opposition." In the letter, Lenin mercilessly criticized the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie and those doubters who used "revolutionary" rhetoric to disguise themselves, painted reality as completely bleak, and were prone to panic and hysteria in the face of difficulties.

    Many materials record Lenin's leadership in the restoration of industry and transportation, and in the electrification of the country, including detailed information about his leadership in the construction of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station and the Kashira Hydroelectric Station (the initial sprouts of the nationwide electrification). The documents also prove that during the domestic war, on the eve of the Battle of Perekop in 1920, Lenin drafted the plan for the Soviet tractor manufacturing industry.

    This volume also includes documents reflecting Lenin's struggle for grain and his hatred of bureaucracy and red tape, as well as letters reflecting the criteria Lenin followed when selecting cadres for the Soviet state.

    苏联出版列宁文集第三十六卷
    首次刊出六百多篇各种文献
    不久前苏联出版的列宁文集第三十六卷中，第一次刊载了列宁在1917年到1923年间所写的六百三十六篇各种文献，包括信件、札记、短评、文章、演讲稿、决议草案、电报等。
    在政治书籍出版局出版的这一本文集中收入了列宁写给所谓“工人反对派”首领之一卢托维诺夫的信。信中列宁毫不留情地批评了小资产阶级的不坚定性和那些好怀疑的人，他们用“革命的”词句掩饰自己，把现实说得一团漆黑，在困难面前则容易陷入惊慌失措和神经质的状态。
    很多材料记载了列宁对恢复工业、运输业和对全国电气化的领导，包括他领导建设沃尔霍夫水电站和卡希拉水电站（全俄电气化的最初萌芽）的详细情况。文献还证明，在国内战争时期，1920年彼列科普战役前夕，列宁就拟定了苏维埃拖拉机制造业的计划。
    这一卷中还收入了列宁为粮食进行斗争和列宁憎恨官僚习气和官僚主义的文件，以及反映列宁选择苏维埃国家的工作干部时所遵循的准则的信件。
