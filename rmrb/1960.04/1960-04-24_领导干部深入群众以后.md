    Overnight
    Since the launch of the safety, fuel-saving, and single-vehicle monthly production of 10,000-kilometer movement, Huang Yanfa has been working diligently from dawn till dusk. However, he has never been able to reach the level of 10,000 kilometers of monthly production. As the saying goes, "A craftsman must sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well." Without trailers, how can he increase the volume of freight? Huang Yanfa has also suggested to the team leaders many times that the twenty-odd broken trailers in the yard should be repaired. He guarantees that he can attach two trailers to his 6069 truck, increase the transport volume, and exceed the level of 10,000 kilometers of monthly production. But the team leaders always say, "The repair workers are already busy enough repairing the main trucks. How can they have time to repair the trailers!"
    On the evening of March 31, Huang Yanfa drove his 6069 truck into the repair shop of the Seventh Team of the Kunming Transportation Station, hoping that they could help him repair it. However, he found that there were already more than forty trucks waiting for repair in the shop. He became nervous because he knew that in the past, the repair shop could only repair a maximum of ten trucks each night. But tonight, there were forty trucks. He didn't know how many days it would take to repair them all!
    Early on the morning of April 1, Huang Yanfa came to the repair shop. He wanted to see what problems his 6069 truck had. If he could help with the repairs, he could try to get it out of the shop earlier. But when he walked into the repair shop, all the trucks were gone. At first, he thought he was seeing things or had gone to the wrong place. It turned out that all the forty-odd trucks that had been there the night before had been repaired and had left the shop. His own 6069 truck, with two trailers attached, was parked on the side of the road outside the shop. Huang Yanfa was so happy that he almost jumped up. He didn't know what to say. Why were they repaired so quickly? He asked, and he learned that the Deputy Director of the Provincial Transportation Bureau, the Chief of the Mechanical Department, the Chairman of the General Station Trade Union, and all the team cadres had gone to the repair shop the night before and worked with the repair workers. Many key problems that had existed in production for a long time were resolved. This greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor. More than forty trucks were repaired overnight. Efficiency was two or three times higher than in the past, and the quality was also better. Moreover, everyone got off work an hour early that night. It was a completely new atmosphere that had never existed before. Huang Yanfa was very excited at this time. He said loudly, "As long as the leading cadres go deep into the front line of production, the monthly production of 10,000 kilometers per vehicle will be guaranteed, and our entire team will soon make a big turnaround."
    Sure enough, on April 7, Huang Yanfa created a new record of one truck pulling three trailers, with a load of 13.5 tons, on the high mountains of the Dongchuan mining area, which are two to three thousand meters above sea level. He exceeded the level of 10,000 kilometers of monthly production per vehicle.

    Yang Daoxiang's Transformation
    Yang Daoxiang, a Bai apprentice worker at the Kunming Motor Factory, had not been to work for three days. According to the workers in the group, three days ago, Yang Daoxiang was late for work. The production group leader asked him why he was late. Yang Daoxiang said, "I'm sick!" The group leader said, "Everyone else is working with great enthusiasm, but only you are dragging your feet. I think you have a 'thought sickness'." The group leader spoke loudly and with a stern attitude. Before he could finish speaking, Yang Daoxiang rushed out and left. After that, he simply didn't come to work. Afterward, some people suggested bringing Yang Daoxiang back, but some people disagreed.
    After discovering this situation, the workshop Party branch felt that in order to save Yang Daoxiang, they must provide patient education and assistance. This required opening up the thinking of cadres and Party members. Therefore, a small meeting was held. The Party branch secretary, Hu Guowan, said to everyone, "Working with people is a difficult task. Yang Daoxiang is a good person, with a good background and simple thoughts. He just doesn't know how to handle life. He can't handle being harshly criticized. We should patiently help him raise his awareness and enthusiastically care for him, so that he feels that the factory is better than his home. Even if we have to look for him a hundred times, we must bring him back." The words of the Party branch secretary touched everyone's hearts. All the Party members and cadres of the work section said that they would mobilize the masses well and must bring this lagging apprentice worker back to the team. After some ideological work, everyone in the entire work section changed their attitude and actively looked for Yang Daoxiang. Those who worked the day shift searched at night; those who worked the night shift searched during the day. Dormitories, canteens, and clubs were searched, but Yang Daoxiang was not found. Some people became impatient again and suggested not looking anymore. Deng Zenglu, the work section leader and Party group leader, firmly said, "We must implement the instructions of the workshop Party branch, bring Yang Daoxiang back, and help him sincerely and patiently, and care for him." So everyone continued to search. Finally, at more than 1:00 a.m. on March 25, after searching one hundred and forty-eight times, they finally found Yang Daoxiang in a dormitory. The comrades not only didn't criticize Yang Daoxiang, but they also asked him with concern how he was doing. At that moment, Yang Daoxiang deeply felt how warm the collective was! He regretted that he should not have been angry with everyone and had not come to work for eight consecutive days. Seeing that Yang Daoxiang had recognized his erroneous thinking, the Party branch secretary immediately talked to him individually, encouraging him to learn from the advanced and engage in innovation. Since then, Yang Daoxiang has actively engaged in production. Within two days, he successfully innovated the double-blade milling screw and the improved processing of screw nuts, increasing efficiency by one to twenty times, respectively. Currently, Yang Daoxiang not only completes his own production tasks every day, but he also often helps others with technological innovations.

    领导干部深入群众以后
    一夜之间
    自从开展安全、省油、单车月产万吨公里的运动以来，黄炎发经常是早出晚归，严肃认真地劳动着，但是却一直没有达到过月产万吨公里的水平。俗话说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，没有挂车，怎样能够增加货运量呢？黄炎发也向队领导多次建议，把车场上那二十多部烂挂车修理好，他保证在自己那部6069号货车上，带上两个挂车，增加运输量，超过月产万吨公里的水平。可是队领导总是说：“保修工人们修理主车就够忙了，哪有时间来修挂车啊！”
    3月31日晚上，黄炎发把6069号货车开进昆明运输总站第七车队的修理场，想请他们帮助自己修理，但他发现场上早已放着四十多部货车等待修理。这时他又紧张起来，因为他知道，过去修理场每天晚上最多只能修好十多部汽车，今晚上一下就摆了四十多部，不知要几天才能修完啊！
    4月1日一早，黄炎发就来到修理场上，他想看看6069号货车究竟有些什么毛病，如果自己能帮助修，就可以争取提前出场。可是当他走进了修理场一看，车子全没有了，起初他还以为自己眼睛花了，或者是走错了地方。原来前一天晚上摆着的那四十多部货车都已修好出场了，他自己那部6069号货车已经带上了两部挂车停在场外的路边上。黄炎发高兴得几乎跳起来，不知道说什么才好。为什么修得这样快？一问，才知道昨天晚上省交通厅运输局副局长、机务科长、总站工会主席和队上的全体干部都深入到修理场和保修工人们一起劳动，许多生产上存在很久的关键问题都得到了解决，大大鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情，一夜之间修好了四十多部货车，效率比过去提高两、三倍，质量也比过去好，并且这天晚上大家还提前一小时下班，真是从来没有过的新气象。黄炎发这时心情非常激动，他大声地说道：“只要领导干部深入生产第一线，单车月产万吨公里就有了保证，我们全车队很快就要大翻身。”
    果然，4月7日，黄炎发就创造了在东川矿区海拔两三千米高的大山上，实现一车三挂，载重十三吨半的新纪录，超过了单车月产万吨公里的水平。
    杨道祥的转变
    昆明电机厂的白族徒工杨道祥，已经有三天没有来上班了。据小组的工人们说，三天前的早上，杨道祥上班迟到了，生产小组长问他为什么迟到？杨道祥说：“有病！”小组长又说：“别人都干劲冲天，唯有你拖拖沓沓，我看你是思想病。”组长说话时声音大，态度也生硬，话还没有说完，杨道祥一冲就走了，以后干脆不来上班了。事后有人建议，把杨道祥找回来，但有些人不同意。
    车间党支部发现这个情况后，感到要挽救杨道祥，必须进行耐心地教育和帮助，这就要打通干部和党员的思想，于是召开了一次小型会议。党支部书记胡国万向大家说：“做人的工作是困难的事。杨道祥这个人，出身好，思想单纯，就是不会处理生活，狠狠批评一顿，他受不了，我们应该耐心地帮助他提高觉悟，热情地关怀他，使他感到在厂里比在家里好，就是找一百次也要把他找回来。党支部书记这些话打动了每个人的心，工段的全体党员和干部都表示，要好好发动群众，一定要让这个掉队的徒工回队来。经过一番思想工作，全工段的人都改变了态度，积极主动地寻找杨道祥了。上白班的晚上去找：上晚班的白天去找。宿舍、食堂、俱乐部，都找遍了也没有找到杨道祥。有些人又沉不住气了，建议不要再找了。工段长兼党小组长邓增禄坚定地说：“一定要贯彻车间党支部的指示，把杨道祥找回来，要诚恳耐心地帮助他，关怀他。”于是大家继续找，直到3月25日晚上一点多钟，大家找到一百四十八次的时候，终于在一间宿舍内找到了杨道祥。同志们看到杨道祥不但没有批评他，大家反而关心地问寒问暖。就在这一瞬间，使杨道祥深深感到，集体是这样温暖！他悔恨自己不该和大家生气，一连八天不来上班。党支部书记见杨道祥对自己的错误思想有了认识，又立即找他个别谈话，鼓励他学先进，搞革新。从此，杨道祥积极搞生产，两天内就搞成功双刀铣螺丝和改进加工螺丝母两项技术革新，分别提高效率一倍到二十倍。目前，杨道祥不仅每天完成自己的生产任务，而且还经常帮助别人搞技术革新。
