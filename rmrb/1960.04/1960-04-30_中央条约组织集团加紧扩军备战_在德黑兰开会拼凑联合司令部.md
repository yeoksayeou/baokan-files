Xinhua News Agency, April 28th, Tehran Dispatch: The Central Treaty Organization began its three-day ministerial council meeting in Tehran today, plotting to intensify arms expansion and war preparations.

The foreign ministers of the member states of this aggressive military bloc, Britain, Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran, attended the opening ceremony. However, the largest delegation attending the meeting was the US delegation, led by Secretary of State Herter, participating as "observers." Although the United States nominally did not participate in this military bloc, it participated in all committees of the group and wielded real power. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes was originally scheduled to attend the meeting, but he was unable to do so due to large-scale student demonstrations against the government in the country today.

According to Western news agencies, the main topic of discussion at this meeting is the establishment of a Central Treaty Organization joint military command, in order to "put teeth" into this aggressive group. The three Muslim member states of this group had secretly discussed this issue in February, and the organization's military committee drafted a report on the establishment of such a command at a meeting held at the end of March. This meeting will also discuss the upcoming East-West summit meeting.

This meeting started with a clamor of "Cold War" rhetoric. In a statement issued on the 26th when he left for Tehran, Herter clamored, "We Americans attach great importance to the Central Treaty Organization. We strongly support the Central Treaty Organization." When he arrived in Tehran on the 27th and made a speech, he again resorted to the trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'," falsely accusing the Soviet Union of "unreasonable interference" in the affairs of the Middle East.

In his speech at the opening ceremony this morning, Herter again clamored that the US government gave this aggressive group "strong support." He called the arms expansion, war preparations, and aggression activities carried out by this group in the Middle East as "beneficial work."

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his speech at the opening ceremony, promoted the notorious "position of strength policy." He said, "In order to ease tensions, it is foolish to try to negotiate from a position of weakness."

### 中央条约组织集团加紧扩军备战  在德黑兰开会拼凑联合司令部

    中央条约组织集团加紧扩军备战
    在德黑兰开会拼凑联合司令部
    新华社28日讯　德黑兰消息：中央条约组织今天在德黑兰开始举行为时三天的部长级理事会会议，策划加紧扩军备战。
    出席会议开幕式的有这个侵略性军事集团的成员国英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦和伊朗的外交部长。但是出席会议的最大代表团却是以“观察员”身份参加的由国务卿赫脱率领的美国代表团。美国虽然名义上没有参加这个军事集团，但是参加了这个集团的所有委员会，并且掌握实权。土耳其总理曼德列斯原定也要出席会议，但由于今天国内发生学生反对政府的大规模示威而没有去成。
    据西方通讯社透露，这次会议讨论的主要内容是成立中央条约组织联合军事司令部，以便为这个侵略集团“装上牙齿”。这个集团的三个穆斯林成员国曾经在2月间密谈过这个问题，这个组织的军事委员会在3月底举行的会议上并草拟了关于成立这种司令部的报告。这次会议也将讨论即将举行的东西方最高级会议。
    这次会议一开始就发出了一片“冷战”的叫嚣。赫脱在26日动身去德黑兰时发表的声明中叫嚷说，“我们美国人十分重视中央条约组织。我们大力支持中央条约组织”。他在27日到达德黑兰发表谈话时，又耍弄“贼喊捉贼”手法，反诬苏联对中东地区的事务进行“无理的干涉”。
    赫脱在今天上午开幕式上致词时又叫嚷美国政府给这个侵略集团以“强烈的支持”。他把这个集团在中东地区所从事的扩军备战和侵略活动称为“有益的工作”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在开幕式上致词中鼓吹臭名远扬的“实力地位政策”。他说，“为了使紧张局势缓和，试图从软弱状态出发进行谈判是愚笨的”。
