Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 2nd: The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee Conference concluded its third week of work today. The discussion revolved around two different paths. The path taken by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries requires discussion of concrete disarmament measures in order to reach a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament, but the Western countries only pay lip service to disarmament and stubbornly use the issue of supervision to obstruct the conference from discussing practical disarmament measures.

At yesterday's meeting, U.S. Representative Eaton declared that he was prepared to "discuss and negotiate in detail and specifically reasonable, fair and guaranteed disarmament measures." But he used this to support his words by demanding that other negotiators agree to provide intelligence on the launching of rockets into outer space and to inspect launch sites. Eaton said he did not know how many launch sites the Soviet Union had, nor did he know where these sites were located. He suggested that both sides send thirty inspectors to inspect the Soviet launch sites and the United States' only two launch sites.

Soviet Representative Zorin said he was disappointed by the U.S. representative's speech. Zorin pointed out that this showed that the U.S. delegation was not prepared to work to achieve complete and thorough disarmament, and was not prepared to discuss the basic principles of a complete and thorough disarmament treaty. The U.S. delegation was interested in measures of inspection and supervision, not disarmament measures.

The reason why Western representatives are so keen on supervision and inspection without disarmament can be seen from the remarks of Italian Representative Martino. In an interview with a reporter from "Italian Newspaper," Martino said, "It seems that the Soviet Union will only agree to an inspection system that will not be used for espionage purposes. But this would mean that such an inspection would be ineffective." However, the only "effective" inspection system that suits the Western taste is a system set up for espionage activities.

At the same time, Western countries are also criticizing the task of reaching an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament that has been put forward to the conference. U.S. Representative Eaton has said that he does not agree with the Soviet representative's definition of complete and thorough disarmament, and he does not know what it is.

The Western position is so untenable that no Western representative dares to face questions from the press. At the first press conference held by Western countries in three weeks yesterday, U.S. Representative Eaton announced that he was not prepared to answer questions, not even those from Western journalists.

People are still reading distorted and fabricated news in the Western newspapers. A recent example is that some Western newspapers have published fabricated news saying that the Soviet spokesman claimed that the Soviet Union would not insist on setting a deadline for achieving complete and thorough disarmament. These fabricated news were immediately refuted by the Soviet delegation. The Soviet delegation issued a statement the day before yesterday saying that these newspapers "are obviously attempting to use this method to justify the Western delegations' obviously contradictory position at the Ten-Nation Committee meeting against setting any deadlines for the implementation of the disarmament plan."

The Western distortion of facts and constant fabrication have been exposed, which has put them in a very embarrassing situation.

    十国裁军会议结束第三周工作
    佐林指出美国不准备实现裁军
    意大利代表透露西方企图通过“视察”进行间谍活动
　　据新华社日内瓦2日电　东西方十国裁军委员会会议今天结束第三周的工作。讨论围绕着两条不同的路线进行。苏联和其他社会主义国家采取的路线要求讨论裁军的具体措施，以便达成一项全面和彻底裁军的条约，但是西方国家却只是空谈裁军，并且顽固地以监督问题来阻挠会议讨论裁军的实际措施。
    在昨天的会议上，美国代表伊顿扬言，他准备“详细而具体地讨论和商谈合理公平的和有保障的裁军措施。”但是他用来支持他这些话的却是要求其它谈判者同意提供关于向宇宙空间发射火箭的情报和对发射场地进行视察。伊顿说，他不知道苏联有若干发射场地，也不知道这些场地在什么地方。他建议双方派出三十名视察员去视察苏联的发射场地和美国仅有的两个发射场地。
    苏联代表佐林说，他对美国代表的发言感到失望。佐林指出，这表明美国代表团不准备努力实现全面彻底裁军，不准备讨论全面彻底裁军条约的基本原则。美国代表团感到兴趣的是视察和监督的措施，而不是裁军措施。
    西方代表所以热中于没有裁军的监督和视察，其原因可以从意大利代表马提诺的谈话中看出来。马提诺在接见“意大利报”记者时说，“看来苏联只有在不会被用来从事间谍活动的目的的情况下才会同意视察制度。但是这将意味着这种视察将是无效的。”可是，适合西方口胃的唯一“有效的”视察制度不过是一个为进行间谍活动而设立的制度。
    与此同时，西方国家还诘难向会议提出的就全面和彻底裁军达成协议的任务。美国代表伊顿就说过，他不同意苏联代表关于全面和彻底裁军的定义，他不知道这是什么。
    西方的立场是这样站不住脚，以致没有一个西方代表敢于面对报界提出的问题。美国代表伊顿在昨天举行的三个星期以来西方国家第一次记者招待会上宣布，他不准备回答问题，甚至西方记者提出的问题也不准备回答。
    人们还在西方报纸上读到歪曲和捏造的消息。最近的例子是西方一些报刊刊载捏造的消息说，苏联发言人声称，苏联将不坚持为实现全面彻底裁军规定期限。这些捏造的消息立即遭到苏联代表团的驳斥。苏联代表团前天发表声明说，这些报刊“显然是企图用这种办法来为反对规定实施裁军计划的任何期限的西方代表团在十国委员会会议上显然是自相矛盾的立场辩解。”
    西方歪曲事实的宣传和捏造不断遭到揭露，这已使它们处于十分狼狈的境地。
