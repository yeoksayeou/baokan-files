Comrade Representatives:

I completely agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. These reports are entirely in line with the current situation in our country and also with the situation in Shanghai. The tasks put forward in the reports are the great goals that the people of the whole country, including the people of Shanghai, must strive to achieve.

Shanghai, like all other parts of the country, is in excellent shape. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the vast number of workers in the city have raised even higher the red banner of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and marched forward into the first year of the 1960s with high spirits. In the first quarter, we have already achieved a great victory with a good start, a good performance every month, and an all-around success. We are now actively preparing for the continued high tide of production throughout the year, to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks assigned to Shanghai by the state this year, and to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of the working class and working people in Shanghai, with soaring enthusiasm and overwhelming momentum, have launched a mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, achieving unprecedented and tremendous achievements. According to preliminary statistics, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city's industrial enterprises has now increased to 80%, with the proportion of mechanization increasing to 48% and the proportion of manual operation decreasing to 20%. Approximately 250,000 workers have been freed from heavy physical labor and manual operation. Many enterprises have also greatly improved their degree of automation and semi-automation. The city has manufactured and retrofitted a total of 10,265 various automated and semi-automated equipment, 299 combined machine tools, 2,671 production assembly lines, and 931 automatic and semi-automatic production assembly lines. Furthermore, 35 automated and semi-automated workshops (sections) and 4 automated and semi-automated factories have emerged. Due to the increased degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the city has saved more than 100,000 workers. The masses of workers use enthusiastic verses such as "Ancient trees sprout new buds, and fresh flowers bloom in the 1960s" to praise this great change in production. They call this change the "Second Liberation" under the leadership of the Party.

The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement on Shanghai's industrial front is vigorous, unprecedentedly large in scale, progressing exceptionally rapidly, extremely rich in content, and particularly significant in its effect. From production workers to auxiliary workers, from small and medium-sized factories to modern large factories, from advanced and sophisticated production departments to manual operation departments, from originally advanced departments and units to originally backward departments and units, almost all have been involved in this movement. The emergence of a red banner unit or a technical revolution vanguard often triggers a series of chain reactions, sparking a wave of competition to catch up and surpass, transforming from one workshop to one factory, from one factory to an entire industry, changing rapidly. Such a moving scene of large-area harvest can be seen everywhere. From the perspective of the current trend of the movement, the content of technical innovation and technical revolution has gone beyond the scope of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. From the reform and creation of tools and equipment to the adoption and manufacturing of new technologies, new processes, and new materials, from the general improvement of product quality to the design, trial production, and production of a large number of high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, from the change of old product designs to the adjustment and improvement of production organization and labor organization, it is truly a "hundred flowers blooming" with an endless stream of innovations. Production organization and enterprise appearance have undergone tremendous changes, and science and technology have achieved many new and significant achievements. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has converged into a massive and comprehensive tide of technical transformation. At the same time, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has spread throughout all sectors of the city. It is not only widely carried out on the industrial front, but also in transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, culture and education, and even in neighborhoods and government agencies. It has created a bustling situation where everyone is innovating, everything is innovating, and every industry is innovating, making the mass character of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement increasingly extensive, rising like a storm, and forming a magnificent national revolutionary movement.

The emergence of such a large-scale and rapidly developing technical innovation and technical revolution movement on all fronts of Shanghai's national economy at the beginning of this year is by no means accidental. It fully embodies the unparalleled power of the Party's General Line and the deep rooting of Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the people, demonstrating that once the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought are understood and mastered by the broad masses of the working people, they become an inexhaustible material force. With the high-speed development of socialist construction, the needs of national construction and people's lives are growing, urgently requiring a leap in production technology to rapidly climb the peaks of world science and technology. This is not only the inevitable trend of the development of the objective situation but also the huge task put forward by the practice of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward and the continuous leap forward in the future. At the same time, the broad masses of the working people have a strong desire to accelerate the speed of construction, get rid of backward manual operations, and liberate themselves from heavy physical labor. They say, "We must lead production, not let production lead us." Under the education and encouragement of the Party's General Line, the vast number of workers are constantly thinking about how to accelerate the construction of socialism, how to have more and more, faster and faster, better and better, and save more and more. They demand a comprehensive transformation of the existing technical base to give their enthusiasm and wisdom more room to play. They have the ambition to "conquer the earth and build a strong country," and are determined to "fill the gaps and climb the peaks." Therefore, once the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that Shanghai should achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and issued a call to further carry out the technical revolution, continuously improve labor productivity, and achieve increased production without increasing personnel, a mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation quickly swept across all fronts of the city with the force of a thunderbolt.

The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is so extensive and profound also because we have implemented the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay. In the practice of the movement, we have found a way to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in a faster, better, and more economical way, and to march towards high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products. This is the only correct way to develop mass creativity in the process of building socialism. With this path, we can rapidly change the face of industrial and agricultural production. In this technical revolution movement, countless facts prove that indigenous methods are native, simple, and feasible. They are not only much more advanced than the old equipment, old processes, and old technologies before the innovation, but some are even more advanced and scientific than the existing foreign equipment, foreign processes, and foreign technologies. Indigenous methods can be simple and crude, using local materials, and can mobilize the masses more widely, enabling everyone to participate; at the same time, they have strong vitality, not only solving key problems in production but also manufacturing cutting-edge products. Because indigenous methods are native, they have greater mass character and are methods of the mass line. Emphasizing indigenous methods as the mainstay can create a vigorous mass movement; after the masses are fully mobilized vigorously, more and more indigenous methods will emerge, showing their power even more. Many industries in the city, relying on the masses to be self-reliant and using indigenous methods to start, have seen the emergence of a group of vanguards who use "poor methods" to make revolution and use the "spirit of the poor" to make revolution. The Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory originally relied mainly on heavy physical labor, with only a manual vise and a few wrenches and chisels in the entire factory. Because the factory's employees used "indigenous methods" and "poor methods" to vigorously carry out technical revolution, indigenous and foreign machinery and equipment such as "electric hoists," "indigenous cranes," "electric welding machines," and "light railways" quickly emerged, freeing them from heavy physical labor and greatly improving production efficiency, achieving the goal of one person doing the work of three and a half people. After the vivid deeds of Zhichengxing Factory's "making revolution with a pair of scissors" spread throughout the city, many small factories launched a wave of "learning from Zhichengxing and catching up with Zhichengxing." The Lianhua Steel Strip Factory caught up from behind, "making a revolution every seven days," and achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the factory. The Zhabei Steel Strip Factory quickly caught up and went to a higher level, not only catching up with Lianhua but also successfully testing several other major projects that Lianhua had not succeeded in testing. Facts have proven that not only can indigenous methods be used to reform outdated equipment in small and medium-sized enterprises, but also in large factories, modern equipment can be manufactured by combining indigenous and foreign methods. The shrink-resistant finishing machine made by the No. 2 State-owned Printing and Dyeing Factory using indigenous methods has the same efficiency as imported goods, but the cost is only one-seventy-fifth of that of imported goods. The Shanghai Motor Factory has vigorously carried out technical innovation using indigenous methods, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the factory has increased from 49% at the end of January to more than 90% at present. Experience has proven that if politics takes command, self-reliance is the mainstay, indigenous and foreign methods are combined, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, and the masses are boldly mobilized, the movement can be vigorous, and the technical revolution can be achieved in a faster, better, and more economical way; conversely, if politics does not take command, if one is greedy for large and foreign things, waits passively, and only a few experts do the work, the movement will inevitably be cold and the technical revolution will inevitably be slow, costly, and inefficient.

In this year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the broad masses of workers and staff have further broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act has become even more enhanced. The subjective initiative of people has been highly developed, showing endless creative power. In many industries, many purely manual workers who had never been exposed to machines in the past were racking their brains to design their own machines and manufacture them themselves. For example, two female packaging workers in their forties at the Weixin Printing Factory built models with playing cards, made paper patterns to build wooden molds, and finally created an ingenious color printing combination machine. The Huasheng Box Factory was originally almost entirely manual operation, with no technical workers in the factory, and 70% of the workers were women. In the vigorous technical revolution movement, they put forward the slogan of "making revolution empty-handed." After collective research, they designed ten kinds of machines overnight, and after three days of hard work, they wiped out the original manual operation. More and more workers in many departments are making every effort to climb the peaks of science and technology in order to catch up with the advanced world level. They issued the bold statement that "What others have, we must have, and what others don't have, we will create." Some cutting-edge products, which they had never seen before, were finally created after bold assumptions and painstaking research. Wang Linhe, a worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, went through 371 experiments, failing repeatedly, but the more he failed, the more he wanted to experiment, indomitable and persevering, and finally successfully trial-produced a high-voltage bridge for testing the performance of insulating materials for high-voltage circuits. Not only the advanced and intermediate people are eager to show their talents, but many originally relatively backward people have also actively joined the movement. There was a female worker in the Shanghai Motor Factory who used to be called "four nothings" (couldn't use her brain, couldn't speak, couldn't work fast, couldn't come back from going out), but now, her colleagues say that she has become "Zhuge Liang," and has successfully completed many innovation projects. The storm of the technical revolution has turned more people into "innovation fanatics." Many people want to innovate and engage in innovation to the point of forgetting to eat and sleep. In the vigorous technical revolution movement, the spirit of communist cooperation is unprecedentedly high, and there is a large-scale integration and cooperation like a net and a forest, crisscrossing each other. There is a combination of cadres, workers, and technicians inside factories and workshops; there is a combination between factories and factories, and between workshops and workshops; there is a combination between urban and rural areas; there is a combination of industrial departments, universities, and scientific research departments; there is a large-scale cooperation between production departments, transportation departments, commercial departments, financial and monetary departments, material supply departments, and service departments; and even in families, there are moving examples of fathers providing technical guidance, sons helping to make models, husbands designing, and wives drawing, combining with each other and making innovations vigorously. "If one factory has a key, all factories help together," "If one place has difficulties, all factories support together," "Visiting to learn from experience," "Sending treasures to the door," etc., are no longer isolated phenomena. Due to the high development of the spirit of communist cooperation, the strength of all sectors of society is gathered together, forming a huge force, like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea, surging forward, so that the technical revolution movement has achieved very significant results in a short period of two or three months. Experience has proven that the broad masses of people contain endless wisdom and strength. Under the education of the Party, their communist style of daring to think, speak, and act and their communist spirit of cooperation of "leaving difficulties and sending convenience" are growing day by day. As long as leaders are good at mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement can be carried out continuously.

The great mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement is not only a technical revolution movement but also a great production revolution movement and a great ideological revolution movement. Due to the vigorous development of this movement, it has blossomed and borne fruit in all aspects, thereby greatly accelerating the pace of production and construction, enabling Shanghai's industrial production to fundamentally change the old "convention" of being lower than the end-of-year level of the previous year in the first quarter of this year, and showing a new atmosphere of balanced production and monthly growth. The average daily output value of the city's industry in the first quarter increased by 4% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, 11.2% in February compared with January, and 10.6% in March compared with February. The total industrial output value in the first quarter completed 25.3% of the annual state plan, and the completion of the annual plan was better than in previous years. Most mechanical and electrical factories started producing products at the beginning of the year, not only producing general products but also products with large processing volumes and long production cycles. In the first quarter, the output of many products not only exceeded the level of the fourth quarter of last year but also completed about one-quarter of the annual task stipulated by the state. These situations have never happened before. Not only has there been a large increase in general products, but also the development of high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products has greatly accelerated, and many new products have been successfully trial-produced. The city successfully trial-produced 5,664 new products in the first quarter. Due to the large-scale emergence of new products, Shanghai's industry has taken a big step forward in the journey of developing in the direction of high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products.

Since the beginning of this year, the achievements of Shanghai's technical innovation and technical revolution movement have been tremendous, and the situation of a good start, a good performance every month, and an all-around success on all fronts is unprecedented. However, this is only laying a foundation for completing the annual task and providing a good start. To complete and overfulfill the annual task and achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward, we must make unremitting efforts. In particular, after the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, China's socialist construction has entered a new stage of continuous leap forward. The Party has called on us to greatly advance the completion of the combat task of catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products within ten years, greatly advance the completion of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967, greatly advance the completion of the National Science Development Plan from 1956 to 1967, and build China into a socialist power with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern defense as soon as possible. In the face of this magnificent goal, Shanghai should give full play to the role of the old industrial base and make greater contributions in accelerating the country's socialist construction.

We have full confidence and determination to complete the task of increasing Shanghai's total industrial output value by 26% on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and strive to overfulfill it, reaching a level of 45%. We must not only complete and overfulfill the state plan, but also develop products more rapidly in the direction of high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge, and strive for product quality to reach the first-class level; we must greatly improve labor productivity, not only achieve increased production without increasing personnel, but also save more labor to support new industrial construction; we must do everything possible to save raw materials, fully utilize raw materials in a comprehensive way, fully utilize all useful resources on Shanghai's local sea, land, and air, and create more new materials; we must vigorously carry out the mass movement of scientific research, universally improve the technical level of the masses, better organize large-scale cooperation in all aspects, and strive to climb the peaks of science and technology; we must vigorously carry out cultural revolution, vigorously run spare-time education, and strive to meet the urgent needs of workers to learn culture and technology, so that the scientific and technical ranks of the working class can grow rapidly; and build Shanghai into one of the national industrial bases for manufacturing high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, and one of the advanced scientific research centers in our country. This is the glorious combat task of the entire Party and the entire people of Shanghai.

The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage of development. This is an important part of the new stage of socialist construction in our country, a powerful factor for faster, better, more economical, and continuous leap forward, which further liberates and develops the social productive forces in our country and greatly accelerates the pace of socialist construction in our country. Under this situation, whoever treats it with a positive and enthusiastic attitude, supports it, and leads it with all his strength is, in the new situation, adhering to the General Line and giving greater play to the power of the General Line; conversely, whoever treats it with a negative, right-leaning, and conservative attitude is, in the new situation, restricting the role of the General Line, stifling the vitality of the General Line, and even violating the General Line. Enthusiasm is inexhaustible, there is no limit to the upstream, there is no end to faster, better, more economical, technical innovation and technical revolution is also endless and without bottom. In this great era of rapid progress, if we do not move forward rapidly and bravely, what is advanced today may become intermediate and backward tomorrow. We must catch up with the situation, we must highly promote the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly struggle against the right-leaning conservative thinking and the mood of fear of difficulties and relaxation, always maintain a vigorous revolutionary will, always stand at the forefront of the struggle, and move towards the great ideal of transforming the world.

In the booming technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a large number of new things are constantly emerging. Many new equipment, new processes, and new technologies have good results when put into production, but at the beginning, it may not be easy for most people to master, or it may not fully meet the requirements of normal production, which requires us to constantly summarize experience and seize the work of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. For innovative projects that have been effective, we must persist and never give up halfway; for those who are not skilled or accustomed to operating by workers, we must organize explanations, performances, and training from various aspects; for new equipment whose performance specifications do not fully meet production requirements, we must actively improve them, and major projects must be tested and technically appraised. For innovative projects that have good production results and have a nature covering the entire industry, we must promptly organize universal promotion in the same industry and the same type of work, so that the advanced level can quickly become the level of the entire industry and the entire type of work, thereby achieving a greater harvest over a larger area. At the same time, we must further organize large-scale integration and cooperation in all aspects, so that the advanced experience of all walks of life, all types of work, and all workshops can not only bloom in a hundred flowers and show their unique abilities but also promote each other and promote each other. Only in this way, according to the different stages of development of the movement, innovating a batch, consolidating a batch, promoting a batch, improving a batch, then innovating, consolidating, promoting, and improving another batch, we can make the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement continuously improve on the basis of popularization, and continue to popularize under the guidance of improvement, and then move towards new and higher goals, so that the movement develops along the correct scientific and national track.

After the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is widely carried out, there will inevitably be situations where some aspects of enterprise production organization and management systems are not adapted. This requires us to foresee these situations, take the initiative to take measures, continuously strengthen leadership and management work, improve production organization and management systems, and continuously make the superstructure and the economic base, the relations of production and the productive forces more adapted, so that we can more effectively organize and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and open up roads for the continuous and high-speed development of productive forces. We must adhere to the spirit of rectification to the end in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, and constantly improve the methods of leadership and style of work, continue to persist in going to production to lead production, and going to the masses to lead the masses, especially to be good at analyzing the situation, constantly grasping and solving new problems in the movement, and pushing the movement from one climax to another new climax.

Through the practice since this year, we deeply realize that under the current excellent situation, our prospects are very bright and infinitely beautiful. We must continue to study Mao Zedong's works, raise the victorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune even higher, inspire greater enthusiasm, march towards the goal of continuous leap forward, and strive to more excellently complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960!

### 上海的技术革命群众运动  曹荻秋代表的发言

    上海的技术革命群众运动
    曹荻秋代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理的报告。这几个报告是完全符合我国当前形势，也是符合上海的情况的。报告中提出的今后任务，是全国人民同时也是上海人民必须努力实现的伟大目标。
    上海和全国各地一样，当前的形势好得很。全市广大职工在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进的基础上，更高地举起党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，昂首阔步地跨进了二十世纪六十年代的第一年—1960年，在第一季度，已经取得了开门红、月月红、全面红的巨大胜利，并正在积极为全年生产的继续高涨做好准备工作，以保证完成和超额完成今年国家分配给上海的任务，实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    今年以来，上海广大工人阶级和劳动人民，以冲天的干劲和排山倒海的声势，掀起了一个群众性的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮，取得了空前未有的巨大成就。据初步统计，目前全市工业企业的机械化、半机械化程度已经提高到80％，其中机械化的比重提高到48％，手工操作的比重下降为20％，约有二十五万工人摆脱了笨重体力劳动和手工操作。许多企业自动化和半自动化程度也有了很大的提高，全市共制造和改装成各种自动化和半自动化的设备一万零二百六十五台，组合机床二百九十九台，组成生产流水作业线二千六百七十一条，自动、半自动生产流水线九百三十一条，并且已经出现了自动化、半自动化车间（工段）三十五个，自动化、半自动化工厂四个。由于机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化程度的提高，全市已经节约劳动力约十万多人。工人群众用“千年古树发了芽，六十年代开鲜花”这些热情的诗句，来歌颂生产上这一伟大的变革。他们把这一变革，称做是党领导下的“第二次解放”。
    上海工业战线当前的技术革新、技术革命运动，声势十分浩大，规模空前壮阔，进展异常迅猛，内容极为丰富，效果也特别显著。全市从生产工人到辅助工人，从中小型工厂到现代化大厂，从高级精密的生产部门到手工操作部门，从原来的先进部门、先进单位到原来的落后部门、落后单位，几乎全部卷入了这个运动。一个红旗单位、一个技术革命尖兵的出现，往往引起一连串的连锁反应，掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮，从一个车间到一个工厂，从一个工厂到整个行业，一日千里，瞬息万变，许多工厂、行业整个翻了身。这种大面积丰收的动人景象到处可见。技术革新和技术革命的内容，从目前运动发展的趋势来看，已经超出了机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的范围，从工具、设备的改革、创造，到新技术、新工艺、新材料的采用和制造，从一般产品质量的提高，到大量高、精、尖产品的设计、试制和生产，从旧产品设计的改变，到生产组织、劳动组织的调整和改进，真是“百花齐放”，层出不穷，生产组织和企业面貌起了极大变化，科学技术有了不少新的重大的成就，技术革新和技术革命运动已经汇总成为一股大规模的全面的技术改造的洪流。同时，技术革新和技术革命运动已经遍及全市各行各业，不仅在工业战线上广泛开展，而且交通运输、基本建设、财贸、文教等各个部门，以至里弄、机关，也大搞技术革新，造成人人革新，事事革新，行行革新的热气腾腾的局面，使技术革新、技术革命运动的群众性愈来愈广泛，风起云涌，形成了一个波澜壮阔的全民的革命运动。
    今年一开始，上海国民经济各条战线上就出现了规模如此巨大，发展如此迅速的技术革新、技术革命运动，决不是偶然的。它充分体现了党的总路线的无比威力和毛泽东思想的深入人心，说明了党的总路线和毛泽东思想一经被广大劳动人民所认识、所掌握，就变成了无穷的物质力量。随着社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，国家建设和人民生活需要日益增长，迫切要求生产技术上有一个飞跃的改变，以便迅速地攀登世界科学技术高峰，这不仅是客观形势发展的必然趋向，也是两年来连续大跃进的实践和今后的持续跃进所提出的巨大任务。同时，广大劳动人民对于加快建设速度，摆脱落后的手工操作，从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，抱有强烈愿望。他们说：“要牵着生产的鼻子走，不能让生产牵着自己的鼻子走。”广大职工在党的总路线的教育和鼓舞下，日思夜想的就是如何加速建设社会主义，如何多了还要多，快了还要快，好了还要好，省了还要省。他们要求对现有技术基础进行全面的改造，使自己的干劲和智慧更有用武之地。他们胸怀“战胜地球，建立强国”的大志，决心“填满空白，攀上高峰”。所以，一经中共上海市委提出了上海今年要实现更大更好更全面的跃进，发出了进一步大搞技术革命、不断提高劳动生产率、实现增产不增人的号召以后，一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，就迅速以雷霆万钧之势，席卷了全市各条战线。
    当前技术革新、技术革命运动所以如此广泛、深刻，还由于我们贯彻执行了土洋并举，以土为主的两条腿走路的方针，在运动实践过程中，找到了一条多快好省地实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，向高精尖产品进军的道路。这是建设社会主义过程中发挥群众创造性的唯一正确的道路。有了这条道路，我们就可以迅速地改变工农业生产的面貌。在这次技术革命运动中，有无数事实可以证明：土办法是土生土长的，简易可行的，它不但比革新以前的旧设备、旧工艺、旧技术先进得多，有一些甚至比现有的洋设备、洋工艺、洋技术还要先进，还要科学。土办法可以因陋就简，就地取材，可以更广泛的调动群众，使人人动手；同时，它具有强大的生命力，不仅能解决生产上的关键问题，而且可以制造出尖端产品。由于土办法是土生土长的，所以它有更大的群众性，是群众路线的办法。重视以土法为主，就能造成轰轰烈烈的群众运动；群众轰轰烈烈充分发动起来以后，土办法也就愈来愈多，愈显出它的威力。本市许多行业由于依靠群众自力更生，运用土办法上马，涌现了一批用“穷办法”闹革命，用“穷棒子精神”闹革命的尖兵。志成兴钢铁制品厂原来以笨重的体力劳动为主，全厂只有一台手工老虎钳、几把板头、凿子，由于全厂职工利用“土办法”“穷办法”，大闹技术革命，很快就出现了“电动行车”、“土吊车”、“电焊机”、“轻便铁道”等土洋机器设备，摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，生产效率大大提高，做到了一个人顶三个半人。志成兴厂“一把剪子闹革命”的生动事迹在全市传开后，很多小厂掀起了“学志成兴，赶志成兴”的热潮。联华带钢厂后来居上，“七天革个命”，实现了全厂机械化、半机械化。闸北带钢厂急起直追，更上一层楼，不但赶上了联华，而且还试验成功了联华没有试验成功的另外几项重大项目。事实证明：不仅在中小型企业中改革陈旧设备可以用土办法，而且在大厂中，制造现代化设备也可以土洋结合，用土办法上马。国营第二印染厂用土办法造的防缩整理机，效率和进口货完全一样，而成本只有进口货的七十五分之一。上海电机厂用土办法大搞技术革新，全厂机械化、半机械化程度从1月底49％提高到目前90％以上。经验证明：如果政治挂帅，自力更生为主，土洋并举，以土为主，放手发动群众，运动就可以轰轰烈烈，技术革命就可以多快好省；反之，如果政治不挂帅，贪大求洋，消极等待，由少数专家动手，运动必然冷冷清清，技术革命必然少慢差费。
    在今年技术革新、技术革命运动中，广大职工群众进一步破除了迷信，解放了思想，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格更加高涨。人的主观能动作用得到了高度发挥，表现出无穷无尽的创造力量。在许多行业中，不少过去从来没有接触过机器的纯手工操作的工人，都苦思多想，自己设计机器，自己制造机器。如维新印刷厂两个四十多岁的女包装工，用扑克牌搭模型，搭了纸型造木模，最后创造出一部精巧的彩印联合机。华生制盒厂原来几乎全部是手工操作，厂里没有一个技术工人，全厂70％是女工，她们在轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动中提出了“手无寸铁闹革命”的口号，经过集体研究，一夜就设计出了十种机器，苦战三天，就使原来的手工操作一扫而光。许多部门有愈来愈多的职工为了迎头赶上世界先进水平，正在排除一切困难，努力攀登科学技术高峰。他们发出了“人家有的，我们要有，人家没有的，我们来创造”的豪言壮语。有些尖端产品，过去他们见也没有见过，经过大胆设想，刻苦钻研，终于创造出来了。沪光科学仪器厂工人王林鹤，前后经过三百七十一次试验，屡次试验，屡次失败，愈是失败，愈要试验，不屈不挠，百折不回，终于试制成功了检验高压电路绝缘材料性能的高压电桥。不仅先进的、中间的人磨拳擦掌，大显身手，很多原来比较落后的人也积极投入了运动。上海电机厂有个女工，过去被人叫做“四不来”（脑筋动不来，讲话讲不来，做活快不来，出门回不来），现在，同伴说她变成了“诸葛亮”了，搞成功了不少革新项目。技术革命的风暴，卷起更多的人变成了“革新迷”。有不少人想革新、搞革新到了废寝忘食的地步。在轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动中，共产主义协作精神空前高涨，出现了如网似林、纵横交错的大结合，大协作，有工厂、车间内部干部、工人和技术人员的结合；有工厂与工厂之间、车间与车间之间的结合；有城乡之间的结合；有工业部门、大专学校与科学研究部门的结合；有生产部门、交通运输部门、商业部门、财政金融部门、物资供应部门和服务部门的大协作；甚至在家庭中，也出现父亲作技术指导，儿子帮助做模型，丈夫设计，妻子画图，相互结合，大闹革新的动人事例。“一厂有关键，各厂齐帮助”，“一处有困难，各厂齐支援”，“登门取经”，“送宝上门”等等，已经不是个别现象。由于共产主义协作精神的高度发扬，社会各方面的力量汇集起来，结成一支巨大的力量，犹如百川归大海，汹涌澎湃地向前奔流，就使技术革命运动在短短二、三个月中取得非常重大的成绩。经验证明，广大群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和力量，他们在党的教育下，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格和“留困难、送方便”的共产主义协作精神一天一天高涨，只要领导者善于发动群众，依靠群众，就可以把技术革新、技术革命运动持续不断地开展下去。
    伟大的群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动，既是一个技术革命运动，又是一个生产大革命运动，也是一个思想大革命运动。由于这个运动的蓬勃开展，在各个方面开花结果，从而大大加速了生产和建设事业的步伐，使上海工业生产在今年第一季度根本改变了历年年初低于上年年末水平的旧“常规”，出现了均衡生产、月月高涨的新气象。第一季度全市工业平均日产值比去年第四季度增长4％，2月份比1月份增长11.2％，3月份比2月份增长10.6％。第一季度工业总产值完成全年国家计划的25.3％，完成全年计划的情况比历年都要好。大部分机械电机工厂年初就出产品，不仅出一般产品，而且出加工量大、生产周期较长的产品。第一季度不少产品产量不仅超过去年第四季度水平，而且完成国家规定的全年任务四分之一左右。这些情况是过去从来没有过的。不仅一般产品有很大增长，而且高级、精密、尖端产品的发展也大大加快了步伐，试制成功了不少新产品。第一季度全市试制成功的新产品有五千六百六十四种。由于新产品的大量涌现，就使上海工业在高级、精密、尖端方向发展的途程中，更加向前迈进了一大步。
    今年以来，上海开展技术革新和技术革命运动的成就是巨大的，各条战线上出现的开门红、月月红、全面红的局面是空前未有的。但这只是为完成全年任务打下了一个基础，有了一个良好的开端，要完成和超额完成全年任务，实现更大更全面的跃进，还必须作坚持不懈的努力。特别是经过1958、1959两年的连续大跃进，我国社会主义建设已经进入持续跃进的新阶段，党号召我们要大大提前实现原定在十年内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国的战斗任务，大大提前实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要，大大提前实现1956年到1967年全国科学发展远景规划，尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国。在这一宏伟的目标面前，上海更应充分发挥老工业基地的作用，在加速国家的社会主义建设过程中，作出更大的贡献。
    我们完全有信心和决心完成国家规定的上海工业总产值在去年大跃进的基础上增长26％的任务，并力争超额完成，达到增长45％的水平。我们不但要完成和超额完成国家计划，而且要使产品更迅速地向高级、精密、尖端的方向发展，力争产品质量达到第一流水平；要大大提高劳动生产率，不但做到增产不增人，而且要节约更多的劳动力，以支援新的工业建设；要千方百计的节约原材料，充分地综合利用原材料，充分地利用上海本地海陆空一切有用的资源，创造出更多的新材料；要大搞科学研究的群众运动，普遍提高群众的技术水平，更好地组织各方面的大协作，努力攀登科学技术高峰；要大搞文化革命，大办业余教育，努力满足工人群众学文化、学技术的迫切需要，使工人阶级的科学技术队伍迅速长大起来；把上海建设成为全国制造高级、精密、尖端产品的工业基地之一，成为我国先进的科学研究中心之一。这是上海全党、全民的光荣战斗任务。
    当前的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经进入一个新的发展阶段，这是我国社会主义建设新阶段的一个重要组成部分，是多快好省、持续跃进的强有力的因素，它使我国社会生产力进一步得到大解放、大发展，大大加快了我国社会主义建设的步伐。在这种形势下，谁用积极热情、全力以赴的态度对待它、支持它、领导它，谁就是在新的情况下，坚持了总路线，更加发挥了总路线的威力；反之，谁用消极的、右倾保守的态度对待它，谁就是在新的情况下，限制了总路线的作用，窒息了总路线的生命力，以至违背了总路线。干劲无穷尽，上游无止境，多快好省没有底，技术革新和技术革命也是无止境、没有底的。在这一日千里的伟大时代里，如果不快马加鞭，勇往直前，今天是先进的，明天就可能成为中间的、落后的。我们一定要赶上形势，一定要高度发扬不断革命的精神，时时刻刻与可能产生的右倾保守思想和畏难松劲情绪作斗争，永远保持旺盛的革命意志，始终站在斗争的最前列，向着伟大的改造世界的理想迈进。
    在蓬勃发展的技术革新和技术革命运动中，不断出现大量的新事物。许多新设备、新工艺、新技术，投入生产效果良好，但一开始很可能不易为多数人所掌握，或者不完全适合正常生产的要求，这就要求我们不断地总结经验，抓紧巩固、推广和提高工作。凡是有效果的革新项目，一定要坚持下去，决不半途而废；对于工人操作不熟练、不习惯的，要从多方面组织讲解、表演和训练；新设备性能规格不完全适应生产要求的，要积极加以改进，重大项目并要经过试验和技术鉴定。凡是投入生产效果良好带有全行业性质的革新项目，一定要在同行业、同工种中及时组织普遍推广，使先进水平迅速成为全行业、全工种的水平，从而取得更大面积的丰收。同时，要进一步组织各方面的大结合、大协作，使各行各业、各工种、各车间的先进经验，既能百花齐放，各显神通，又能互相推动，互相促进。只有这样，按照运动的不同发展阶段，革新一批，巩固一批，推广一批，提高一批，再革新、巩固、推广、提高一批，我们就可以使技术革新和技术革命运动的成就在普及的基础上不断提高，在提高的指导下继续普及，而后又向新的更高的目标前进，使运动沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道向前发展。
    技术革新和技术革命的群众运动广泛开展以后，必然会出现企业生产组织、管理制度等某些方面不相适应的情况。这就要求我们预见到这些情况，主动采取措施，不断加强领导和管理工作，改进生产组织和管理制度，不断使上层建筑与经济基础、生产关系与生产力更加适应，这样，就可以把广大群众的积极性、创造性更有效地组织起来，调动起来，为不断地高速度发展生产力开辟道路。我们一定要根据毛泽东同志的教导，把整风的精神坚持到底，不断改进领导方法和工作作风，继续坚持到生产中去领导生产，到群众中去领导群众，特别是要善于分析形势，不断抓紧和解决运动中新的问题，把运动从一个高潮推向另一个新的高潮。
    通过今年以来的实践，我们深深体会到：在当前大好形势下，我们的前景是十分灿烂和无限美好的。我们必须不断努力学习毛泽东著作，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利旗帜，鼓起更大的干劲，向着持续跃进的目标进军，为更出色地完成和超额完成国家交给我们的任务，为实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋勇前进！
