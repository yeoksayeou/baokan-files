    This Time I've Jumped Out!
    Li Shuying, Resident of Ziyou Road, Heping District, Tianjin
    I am a housewife with seven children, only thirty-five years old this year. In 1957, I came out to participate in sewing work. At that time, I arranged my children: the older ones took turns cooking at home; the younger ones took care of my youngest child. At that time, the children were also happy to help their mother participate in production, and I was even happier. However, not long after, my seventh little daughter broke her leg due to lack of care! Another of my children also got sick and was hospitalized. You see, how many things could I possibly take care of? I hardened my heart and went back home again.
    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, my heart stirred again. I thought I also had an obligation to contribute to national construction, and I couldn't let the children, oil, salt, firewood, and rice tie up my hands and feet all the time! So I came out again. First, I participated in handling bank savings business, but because of cooking, my conflicts with the children were still many. Originally, we had divided the work and scheduled days to take turns cooking, but either I was too busy with work to cook, or the children were too busy with homework or had to take exams, etc., and had no time to cook. This had an impact on everyone's important matters, and sometimes we couldn't even eat because we were waiting for each other. As a mother, I couldn't watch my whole family go without food! As a result, I was discouraged and took the road back again—going home to cook, wash clothes, and take care of the children.
    This time, under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of the Guangfu Road Store, the residents of our street have organized and are vigorously developing collective production and welfare undertakings. Seven or eight public canteens have been established right here in our street, as well as nurseries, kindergartens, laundry groups, repair groups, and an all-purpose service station. I have jumped out from beside the stove again, and this time I jumped out, I will never go back again.
    Now, our whole family eats in the street's public canteen, three children go to school, three children are in kindergarten, and the youngest is in the nursery. The teachers and caregivers take good care of them, so I don't have to worry about them. The children are also happy that they don't have to cook anymore. As for me, I have returned to the sewing group to participate in production and have also become the group leader. In addition to production, I am now also busy with street welfare undertakings. Due to the street's vigorous organization of people's economic life, among the more than 1,400 households in our "Plaza" area, more than 300 housewives have been liberated to participate in street production, some participating in medicine packaging, some participating in paper mounting and sewing work. We produce for six hours a day and study politics and culture for another two hours. Our lives are changing. We are sincerely grateful to the Party and to Chairman Mao for bringing us such happy days.

    这一回我可跳出来了
    天津和平区自由道居民　李淑英
    我是一个有七个孩子的家庭妇女，今年才三十五岁。1957年，我出来参加过缝纫工作。当时我把孩子们安排好：大一点的在家轮流做饭；让再小一点的看管我最小的孩子。当时孩子们也乐意帮助妈妈出来参加生产，我心里更高兴。可是，没有好久，我的第七个小女儿由于缺少人照顾，把腿摔折了！我的另一个小孩也得病住了医院。您看，我这个心能顾得上几头呵？狠了狠心，我又回到家里来了。
    1958年大跃进，我的心又动了。我想我也有为国家建设出力的义务，不能老让孩子、油盐柴米把我的手脚捆住呀！我又出来了。先是参加办理银行储蓄业务，但是为了做饭的事，我和孩子们的矛盾仍然很多。本来是分好了工、排好日子轮流做饭的，不过临时不是我工作忙做不了饭，就是孩子们功课忙、或者是要考试了等等，没有时间做饭。这样对于大家的正事都有影响，有时甚至你等我，我等你的连饭也吃不上。我这个当妈妈的不能看着全家人不吃饭呀！结果我灰了心，又走了回头路——回家做饭、洗衣、看起孩子来了。
    这一回，我们在党的领导下，在光复道商店的协助下，我们街道的居民组织起来了，大搞集体生产福利事业。就在我们这街里成立了七、八个公共食堂，还有托儿所、幼儿园、洗衣组、修配组、万能服务站，我又从锅台旁边跳出来了，并且这一回跳出来，以后永远也不再回去了。
    现在我们全家老小都在街道公共食堂吃饭，三个小孩上学，三个小孩在幼儿园，一个最小的在托儿所，老师、阿姨照顾得很好，都不用我操心了。孩子们也高兴自己不再做饭了。我呢，又回到缝纫组参加生产，并且担任了小组长。除了生产之外，现在还为街道福利事业奔忙。由于街道大力组织人民经济生活，我们“广场”这一带一千四百多户当中，又有三百多家庭妇女解放出来参加了街道生产，有的参加包药工作，有的参加裱纸、缝纫工作。我们一天生产六小时，另外两个小时学习政治、文化，我们的生活正在发生变化。我们打心眼里感激党，感激毛主席带给我们这样幸福的日子。
