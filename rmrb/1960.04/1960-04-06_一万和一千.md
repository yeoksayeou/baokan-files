    Ten Thousand and One Thousand
    Wang Shusen, First Secretary of the CPC Black Mountain County Committee, Liaoning

    Our Black Mountain County does not have a long history. Several decades ago, the northern part was a range of overlapping, long, undulating green mountains, and the southern part was a vast expanse of endless grasslands, sparsely populated with few fertile fields. During the fourteen years of Japanese occupation, almost all the trees were cut down, turning the green mountains into bald mountains, allowing mountain water to recklessly pour onto the plains, converging into five major rivers. Over time, the riverbeds expanded, truly becoming a situation where no mountain was green and every river was a hazard.

    Now things have changed, turned upside down, completely different from the past! In just two years, five medium-sized reservoirs have been built, along with many river networks, canals, and deep wells. The amount of water conservancy construction in the past two years is equivalent to six times the amount built in the previous eight years, and the irrigated area has increased fifty-threefold. With the completion of the reservoirs and river networks, basic afforestation has also been achieved around the barren hills.

    Today's Black Mountain is truly covered in green gauze on all the bald mountains, and the barren land has been transformed into fertile fields. Large reservoirs are like the sea, with surging waves, a vast expanse of blue, teeming with white ducks and swimming with colorful fish below the mountains. Deep wells are dotted everywhere, surrounding the reservoirs, like stars accompanying the bright moon, appearing particularly beautiful. Connected to the reservoirs are the river networks and canals, reservoirs connected to reservoirs, canals connected to canals, rivers connected to rivers, crisscrossing and interweaving, with silver ribbons across the land and green nets covering fertile fields, providing both irrigation and navigation. It is truly a beautiful picture of green mountains and clear waters.

    When these reservoir projects first started, everything was done by manual labor, carrying everything by shoulder. Although the enthusiasm was high, the efficiency was low, and the progress was slow. For some reservoirs, the farthest soil extraction site was five *li* from the dam. It was tiring enough to walk ten *li* round trip empty-handed every day, let alone carrying a hundred *jin* of soil? At that time, it was calculated that each person completed an average of only 0.1 cubic meters of earth per day. Moreover, the spring planting and summer hoeing were approaching, and conflicts arose between water conservancy construction and agricultural production. So everyone used their brains and hands to implement clever work methods.

    Once the slogan for large-scale tool reform was issued, the masses immediately responded. They pondered day and night, sometimes forgetting to eat in order to finish early. After a period of hard work and overcoming numerous difficulties, batches and countless new tools were created. For example, the "ground slider," "roller horse," "high mountain flying car," and "aerial flying basket" created by the workers and cadres of the Youlin Reservoir. Zhang Yujin, a carpenter at the river network construction site, created thirteen advanced tools by himself.

    With the emergence of new tools, people smiled with joy. Not only was a large amount of labor force reduced and put into agricultural production, realizing a double leap in water conservancy construction and agricultural production, but also heavy physical labor was reduced, freeing up hands and shoulders, greatly improving work efficiency. People praised in unison:

    The Party's leadership is determined,
    Fearing no difficulty,
    Tool reforms are many and complete,
    A thousand-day project completed in a hundred.

    After tool reform and the realization of semi-mechanization and soil mechanization construction, the construction site became a factory, where songs and machine sounds could be heard everywhere, resonating and resounding through the clouds. The "ground slider" was fully loaded with soil and people, and from a distance, it was difficult to tell what kind of vehicle it was. It looked like a train, but without smoke; like a car, but without oil; truly like a warship sailing in the stormy sea. Looking up, the aerial flying baskets and high-altitude postal vehicles were tumbling up and down like shuttles, busily circulating endlessly. The tools at the river network construction site also showed great power, realizing that no pickaxe was needed for splitting soil, no shovel was needed for digging soil, no carrying was needed for transporting soil, and the machine was operated by people, greatly improving work efficiency. Whether on the reservoir or river network construction sites, people everywhere sang this song during labor:

    Building dikes and carrying soil, passed down through generations,
    One pair of hands, two shoulders,
    No matter how much soil, how big the stones,
    Either carried or moved.

    Technical reforms are greatly developed,
    From now on, no need to carry to build dikes,
    Both hands and shoulders are completely liberated,
    The benefits of tool reform are endless.

    The path taken by tool reform is a process from nothing to something, from few to many, from small to large, from point to surface, from native to foreign. In the beginning, they were mostly native, small, and semi-mechanized, gradually moving towards foreign and mechanized. Now, the reinforcement and upgrading project of the Longwan Reservoir in Black Mountain County has largely achieved foreign and higher mechanization. The widely used flat conveyor, crawler winch, underground circulating train, cableway traction machine, and high-dam winch. On the basis of improving the work efficiency by several times or dozens of times through the original soil mechanization, it has been further improved to dozens of times, and the highest has reached more than a hundred times. The original plan for Longwan Reservoir was to have 10,000 people working on it. After the realization of mechanization, the task can be completed on time and with quality by 1,000 people in the same amount of time.

    The heavy physical labor in water conservancy construction has been reduced; the work efficiency has been greatly improved. People are constantly repeating the ratio of ten thousand to one thousand. How exhilarating this is! Let us sing loudly for continuing to vigorously promote tool reform!

    一万和一千
    中共辽宁黑山县委第一书记　王树森
    我们黑山县的历史并不长，在几十年以前，北部还是重重叠叠的漫长起伏的青山，南部是一片片一望无际的草原，人烟稀少，良田无几。自日本鬼子统治了十四年，把所有的树几乎砍光，把青山变成了秃山，使山水肆无忌惮地倾泻平原，汇成了五条大河，日积月累，河身扩大，那真是无山不秃，无河不害。
    现在变了，天翻地复了，和过去截然不同了！仅仅两年的时间，就修成中型水库五座，以及很多河网、渠道、深井。两年来的水利建设工程量，相当于前八年所修建工程量的六倍，灌溉面积增加五十三倍，随着水库、河网的建成，也基本实现了荒山四旁都绿化。
    现在的黑山真是秃山全披上绿纱，荒地尽变良田，大水库像海一样，波浪滔天，一碧万顷，水上白鸭群集，山下锦鳞游泳。深井星罗棋布，衬托在水库四周，有如群星伴明月，显得格外美丽。和水库相接的就是河网和渠道，库库相接，渠渠相连，河河相通，纵横交织，大地飘银带，绿网罩良田，既能灌溉又能通船。真是一幅山青水秀美丽的图画。
    这些水库工程刚开始的时候，完全是人挑人担，干劲虽然很足，可是效率不高，进度迟缓。有的水库最远的取土场，离大坝五华里。来回十里地，空手每天走十趟，也是够累的了，何况还要担着一百斤土呢？当时计算，每人每日平均只完成零点一方土。更加春耕播种和夏锄铲趟，也已相继来临，水利建设和农业生产发生了矛盾。大家于是就动脑动手实行巧干。
    大搞工具改革，口号一发出之后，群众立即响应。他们昼夜苦思，甚至有时为提前制成，忘掉了吃饭。经过一段刻苦钻研，克服了重重困难，成批的、无数的新工具创造出来了。如友邻水库民工和干部一起创造的“地滑车”、“轱辘马子”、“高山飞车”、“空中飞篮”等工具。河网工地木匠张玉金，一个人就创造出十三种先进工具。
    新的工具出现了，人们喜笑颜开，不但减少了大批劳动力，投入农业生产，实现了水利建设和农业生产双跃进，而且也减轻了笨重的体力劳动，解放了一双手两个肩，大大地提高了工效。人们异口同声地称赞说：
    党的领导决心大，
    千难万难都不怕，
    工具改革多又全，
    千日工程百日完。
    工具改革，实现半机械化，土机械化施工之后，工地变成了工厂，到处都可以听到歌声，机械声，连成一片，响彻云霄。“地滑车”满载一车土，车上还坐着人，从远处望去，不知是什么车，像火车，不冒烟，像汽车不用油，真似海洋里军舰一样，在波滔汹涌的大海里航行着。抬头一看，空中飞篮，高空邮车，像穿梭一样地上下翻腾，循环不已的忙碌着。河网工地工具也大显威风，实现了劈土不用镐，挖土不用锹，运土不用挑，机械人操纵，工效大提高。无论水库和河网工地上，人们在劳动中到处唱着这样一支歌：
    筑堤挑土辈辈传，
    一双手来两个肩，
    不管土多石头大，
    不是挑来就是搬。
    技术改革大开展，
    从此筑堤不用担，
    双手双肩全解放，
    工具改革好处说不完。
    工具改革所走的道路，是由无到有，由少到多，由小到大，由点到面，由土到洋的过程。开始时大都是土的、小的、半机械化的，逐渐走向洋的、机械化的。现在黑山县龙湾水库加固升级工程，大部实现了洋的、较高的机械化。广泛地使用平运传动机、履带式卷扬机、地下循环列车、索道牵引机、高坝卷扬机。工效由原来土机械化提高几倍，十几倍的基础上，又提高到几十倍，最高的达一百多倍。龙湾水库原来计划一万人施工，实现机械化后，以同等的时间，用一千人就可以按时、按质地完成任务。
    水利建设中笨重的体力劳动减少了；工效大大地提高了。人们无时无地不在复诵着一万和一千的比例。这是多么使人心情振奋啊！让我们来为继续大搞工具改革高歌猛进吧！
