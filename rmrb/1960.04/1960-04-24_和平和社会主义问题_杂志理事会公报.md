    The Council listened to the report from the Editorial Board on the work of the magazine, and discussed the tasks of the magazine and the measures to improve its work. The Council unanimously pointed out that the magazine, following the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the Moscow Declaration and Peace Manifesto of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, promoted the strengthening of the ideological unity and solidarity of the international communist movement, and played a positive role in further exploring and clarifying Marxist-Leninist theoretical problems, in the struggle against revisionism and dogmatism, and in the exchange of opinions and experiences between Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The extremely important tasks of the magazine are: to promote the organized and unified action of the working class in capitalist countries to defend the interests of the working people, and to strive for their unity in the struggle against the reactionaries and for democracy and social progress; to systematically expose anti-communism, to wage a struggle against bourgeois and reformist ideology, to oppose revisionism as the main danger, and to oppose dogmatism and sectarianism. The magazine will systematically expound on the national liberation movement issues.

    The discussion of the work of the "Problems of Peace and Socialism" magazine was conducted in an atmosphere of consensus on all the issues discussed.
