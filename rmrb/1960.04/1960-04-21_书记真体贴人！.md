    The secretary is so considerate!
    Wang Xinqing, the Party Branch Secretary of the Changgong Brigade of the Bali Commune in Xin County, Henan Province, is a model worker in Henan Province.
    After the higher Party committee put forward the call for "Secretaries to Enter the Canteens," Wang Xinqing immediately took his luggage and went to the Xiaoshi'ao public canteen to work as a cook. He carried water, chopped firewood, cut vegetables, and cooked food, doing everything.
    One day at noon, an old woman returned from the fields, looking a little tired. Wang Xinqing immediately brought her a bowl of noodles and said, "It's hot, have some soup to quench your thirst!" The old woman smiled and said, "The secretary is so considerate!"
    In order to run the canteen well, Wang Xinqing often solicited opinions from commune members to improve the work. One commune member suggested that they wanted to eat fried dough sticks once. Wang Xinqing organized sixteen old people to collect tea seeds to extract oil, and made fried dough sticks and fried sugar cakes, etc., which the commune members enjoyed very much! He also led the cooks to grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, and raise ducks, vigorously developing the canteen's household production. Seeing how well this canteen was run with Wang Xinqing's help, all the canteens in the brigade came to "learn from the experience." In just a few days, all twenty canteens in the brigade were transformed.

    书记真体贴人！
    河南省新县八里公社长岗大队党支部书记王信清，是河南省的劳动模范。
    上级党委提出“书记进食堂”的号召后，王信清立即就带着行李卷到小石凹公共食堂去当炊事员。他挑水劈柴，切菜做饭，样样都干。
    一天中午，一位大娘从田里回来，看样子有点累了，王信清马上端着一碗面条送到她面前，说了声：“天热了，先吃点有汤的解解渴吧！”大娘笑迷迷地说：“书记可真体贴人啊？”
    为了把食堂办好，王信清经常征求社员的意见改进工作。有一个社员提意见说，想吃一次油条，王信清就组织了十六个老人去拾茶子榨油，做成了油条、油糖糕等，社员们吃得真高兴！他还带领炊事员种菜、养猪、养鸡、养鸭，大搞食堂的家底生产。全大队的食堂看到这个食堂在王信清的帮助下办得这般好，都来“取经”，几天的光景，全大队的二十个食堂都变了样。
