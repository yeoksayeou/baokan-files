Improve Feeding Management, Accelerate Livestock Development
——Shandong Summarizes and Promotes Typical Experiences in Developing Large Livestock

Editor's Note: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the typical experiences of Cangshan County's consecutive leaps forward in large livestock production, the establishment of livestock production hospitals by the Daxindian People's Commune in Penglai County to ensure full production and survival of pregnant animals, and the establishment of sanatoriums for weak, old, and sick livestock in Wenshang County, and promoted them throughout the province. These experiences broke with the old conventions of raising livestock and have many new innovations in management methods, which are worthy of attention. It is hoped that all localities can also earnestly summarize the local experience in livestock feeding management and pay attention to learning from the experience of other places, which will have a significant role in accelerating the development of animal husbandry production.

Cangshan's Large Livestock Develops Rapidly
Cangshan County has plains and mountains. The county's large livestock production has leapt forward year after year. In 1958, the county's draft animals developed to 55,774 head, an increase of 17.3% compared with before liberation, with each draft animal averaging 25 mu of cultivated land. The great development of draft animals enables intensive farming and more fertilizer application in agricultural production. In 1959, the county's average grain yield per mu was 460 jin, an increase of 40% compared with 1958. The main experiences of Cangshan County's annual leap forward in large livestock production are:

	(1) Vigorously grasp breeding and reproduction, and launch a mass movement of draft animal breeding and reproduction. In the process of developing animal husbandry production, a struggle between two ideologies has been continuously carried out. Due to the adoption of political work combining propaganda and education with accounting and comparison, the county has established confidence in vigorously developing draft animals and adhered to the policy of self-breeding and self-raising. The county has introduced and selected 493 head of fine breeding livestock from other places and locally, established 198 breeding stations and 20 breeding farms for cows, and trained 378 breeding personnel. A livestock increasing movement of two full (full fat, full pregnancy) and five complete (complete mating, complete accuracy, complete production, complete survival, complete growth) was launched throughout the county, and advanced breeding methods such as double mating, re-mating, artificial estrus induction, and artificial insemination were promoted. Production teams generally formulated a reward system for draft animal breeding and reproduction. After taking the above measures, the breeding rate and survival rate of draft animals have been greatly improved. In 1959, the county bred more than 20,000 young animals, and in addition to meeting the needs of agricultural production in the county, it also supported other places with more than 5,000 head.

	(2) Do a good job in feeding management, vigorously grasp feed, and establish a scientific feeding management system. First, the feeding team was rectified, impure elements and incompetent personnel among the feeders were cleaned and replaced, 1,500 feeders were trained, and commune members with progressive ideology, feeding experience, and love for this work were selected to serve as feeders. The feeding management methods of eight fixations (fixed fodder, fat, reproduction, service, fertilizer accumulation, management personnel, remuneration, rewards) and seven separations (separating male and female, strong and weak, old and young, large and small, sick and healthy, fast and slow, pregnant and non-pregnant animals) were universally promoted. During the vigorous season of green grass and the harvest season of crops, a mass movement of collecting fodder grass was launched. In the past year, in addition to meeting the needs of feeding, the county also stored more than 400 million jin of various fodder grass. According to the calculation of developing 85,000 head of draft animals in 1960, with 5,000 jin of grass per head, there is still a surplus of fodder grass.

	(3) Grasp epidemic prevention and ensure the healthy development of livestock. The county has a livestock epidemic prevention station, and the production team has an epidemic prevention group. In addition to equipping a certain number of veterinary technicians and training a large number of mass epidemic prevention personnel, the role of folk Chinese veterinarians has been fully utilized. The three key aspects of prevention, epidemic, and treatment were grasped, and a mass epidemic prevention movement was vigorously launched. In terms of prevention, the main focus is on regular cleaning of livestock pens, regular washing and disinfection of feeding utensils; giving livestock vaccinations three times a year; improving pens to make livestock barns meet the requirements of being sunny, ventilated, and light-transmitting. In 1959 alone, the county improved, repaired, and built more than 70,000 livestock pens, and did a good job in winter to keep livestock barns warm, so that livestock could safely overwinter. In terms of epidemic, the main focus is on strengthening epidemic control, adopting the method of three unifications (unified leadership, unified organization, unified action) and five members (epidemic prevention personnel, feeders, sanitation personnel, tax officials, traders) large-scale collaboration, dividing areas and assigning responsibilities, and checking head by head. In terms of treatment, sick animals are immediately isolated and treated, and the masses are mobilized to inspect and supervise the processing and deep burial of sick and dead animals. Due to the adoption of the above measures, the epidemic diseases of livestock have been effectively prevented and eliminated. From 1957 to the present, no livestock epidemic has occurred in the county for three consecutive years.

	(4) Strengthen the leadership of the Party and launch a mass movement. The county and commune have established livestock production offices, and the production team has established a feeding management committee or group. Party committees at all levels have dedicated secretaries personally in charge, grasping this work tightly and practically. The county party committee focused on the Xiacun and Zhongcun communes, which have developed draft animals rapidly, and specifically helped them take the lead in various tasks, set an example, hold on-site meetings, and promote them universally. Planned to launch red flag competition movements between communes and teams, and held commendation meetings. In the first half of 1959, the county commended and rewarded a total of 42 production teams with more livestock, faster breeding, and no epidemic diseases, and more than 1,000 outstanding feeders, breeders, and epidemic prevention personnel. The county party committee also held 34 training courses, training more than 1,400 technical personnel of various types, strengthening the technical team, and powerfully promoting the continuous leap forward in animal husbandry production.

Daxindian Commune Builds Livestock Production Hospital
The Daxindian People's Commune is located in the southeastern part of Penglai County, which is a semi-hilly area. The commune currently has 4,986 head of draft animals, including 1,807 breeding cows of appropriate age, of which 1,704 have been mated and conceived, with a full pregnancy rate of 94.4%. Previously, the commune did not pay enough attention to fetal protection and calving, and the abortion rate in 1958 accounted for 40%.

In order to change this situation, the commune party committee established a livestock production hospital in May 1959. By January 1960, it had accommodated 156 pregnant animals and produced 156 young animals, all of which were raised and survived. The livestock production hospital is equipped with gauze, scissors, iodine, lysol, and other commonly used medicines and equipment for new-style delivery. The delivery staff also serve as feeders. Pregnant animals are admitted to the hospital five to ten days before delivery, and the accounting unit brings its own fodder. Old cows are mated six days after delivery, and young cows are mated eight days after delivery, until they are accurately mated twelve to fifteen days after delivery and discharged from the hospital. After the 156 cows delivered by the hospital were given hot mating, the pregnancy rate reached 97%.

The livestock production hospital has also formulated a scientific feeding and nursing system. When livestock are admitted to the hospital, they must achieve "one determination," "two disinfections," "three inspections," and "four attentions." "One determination" means: fixed dedicated personnel management; "Two disinfections": disinfection of delivery room and delivery equipment; "Three inspections": check for vaginal discharge, check for mammary gland enlargement, check for fetal movement after drinking water; "Four attentions": pay attention to the dynamics of the cow, the habits of the cow, changes in appetite, and edema of the hindquarters. Before delivery, "three preparations" should be made, namely: preparing disinfectants, bedding grass, millet porridge or bran water; during delivery, "three timeliness" should be achieved: timely untie the reins, cut the umbilical cord, and wipe dry the mucus all over the young animal; after delivery, help the young animal stand up and prevent constipation. If an offensive smelling mucus is found flowing from the cow's vagina, disinfect the vaginal cavity with disinfectant solution; if the young animal has constipation, feed it a mild laxative; if the cow does not love the young animal, soothe the cow to help it love the young animal.

The livestock production hospital has many benefits: first, it creates good conditions for draft animal breeding; second, it facilitates the promotion of new-style delivery, ensuring that pregnant cows produce fully and young animals survive fully; third, it ensures that cows are mated on time after delivery and conceive on time; fourth, it ensures that pregnant cows have sufficient rest time and sufficient nutrition before and after delivery; fifth, it reduces the energy and time spent by each production team in taking care of cows during production.

Currently, the commune has 1,704 pregnant cows and plans to have them all delivered in the hospital to ensure that the cows safely calve and survive fully.

Wenshang Runs Livestock Sanatorium
In order to change the situation of weakness and death of draft animals in winter, the Wenshang County Party Committee organized forces last winter to conduct a county-wide inspection of draft animals and found 649 head of sick and weak livestock. In order to enable these livestock to recover their health in a timely manner, 79 livestock sanatoriums were established throughout the county, accommodating 353 head of sick livestock and 296 head of weak livestock. After careful feeding and treatment, as of mid-February this year, 305 head of livestock have recovered their health.

The Shahezhan Commune Party Committee specially sent Secretary Zhang Laibin and Commune Chief Wang Fukun to personally explore experience at the Qiaocun Brigade Livestock Sanatorium. They concentrated seven sick livestock and nine old and weak livestock in the livestock sanatorium and adopted the method of three guarantees to the hospital (that is, strong guidance cadres to the hospital to guarantee management, veterinary epidemic prevention personnel with treatment and epidemic prevention experience to the hospital to guarantee disease treatment and epidemic prevention, and excellent feeders to the hospital to guarantee livestock feeding), and must feed the weak livestock well. In terms of care, three fixations (fixed personnel, fixed fodder, fixed weight gain recovery period), four knowledges (knowing hunger, knowing fullness, knowing cold, knowing heat), three diligences (diligent hands, diligent eyes, diligent legs), and six cleanlinesses (clean grass, clean feed, clean pens, clean troughs, clean animal bodies, clean livestock farms) were achieved. Due to the adoption of the above measures, the 16 livestock recuperating in the hospital have generally gained weight by 10%. Due to the implementation of feeding coarse feed finely, carefully preparing, and diversifying palatability in feeding, the livestock's appetite has greatly increased. When they entered the hospital, donkeys generally only ate seven or eight jin of grass per day, but later increased to 17 jin per day, and cattle also increased from 12 jin of grass to 20 jin. As of mid-February, nine draft animals have been inspected and deemed qualified to be discharged from the hospital.

Wenshang County has adopted various methods of establishing livestock sanatoriums according to local conditions. For example, Ciqiu Commune adopted the approach of communes building sick livestock hospitals and brigades building old, disabled, and weak livestock hospitals. Livestock that need to enter the hospital must be inspected and approved by veterinary personnel in advance before being sent to the commune's sick livestock hospital for treatment; livestock that are still very weak after treatment are then sent to the brigade's sanatorium for a longer period of recuperation. In addition to establishing hospitals and sanatoriums, the Nanzhan Commune also specially established an isolation hospital for livestock with mange, concentrating all cattle with mange for isolated feeding and treatment.

    改进饲养管理　加速牲畜发展
    ——山东总结推广几个发展大家畜的典型经验
    编者按　中共山东省委最近总结了苍山县大家畜连年跃进、蓬莱县大辛店人民公社建立畜产院保证孕畜全产全活、汶上县建立残老病弱牲畜疗养院等典型经验，在全省普遍推广。这些经验打破了过去饲养牲畜的陈规，在管理方法上有许多新的创造，很值得重视。希望各地也能认真地总结本地牲畜饲养管理的经验，并注意学习外地的经验，这对加速畜牧业生产的发展有重大作用。
    苍山大家畜发展快
    苍山县有平原有山岭，全县大家畜生产连年跃进。1958年全县耕畜发展到五万五千七百七十四头，比解放前增长17.3％，每头耕畜平均负担耕地二十五亩。耕畜大发展，能使农业生产精耕细作，增施肥料。1959年全县粮食平均亩产四百六十斤，比1958年增长40％。苍山县大家畜生产年年跃进的主要经验是：
      （一）大抓配种繁殖，开展群众性的耕畜配种、繁殖运动。在发展畜牧生产的过程中，不断进行了两种思想的斗争。由于采取了宣传教育与算账对比相结合的政治工作，在全县树立了大力发展耕畜的信心，坚持执行自繁自养的方针。全县由外地引进和当地选留出优良种畜四百九十三头，设立了一百九十八处配种站，二十处母牛繁殖场，培训了三百七十八名配种员。在全县开展了两满（满膘、满怀）五全（全配、全准、全产、全活、全壮）的增畜运动，推广了双配、复配和人工催情、人工授精等先进配种方法。各生产队普遍制订了耕畜配种繁殖奖励制度。采取以上措施后，大大提高了耕畜繁殖率和成活率。全县1959年即繁殖幼畜二万余头，除满足了本县农业生产需要外，还支援外地五千余头。
      （二）搞好饲养管理，大抓饲料，建立科学的饲养管理制度。首先整顿了饲养队伍，清洗和撤换了饲养员中不纯分子和不称职的人员，训练了一千五百名饲养员，选拔了思想进步、有饲养经验而又热爱这项工作的社员担任饲养员。普遍推广了八定（定草料、膘肥、繁殖、使役、积肥、管理人员、报酬、奖励），七分开（公与母、强与弱、老与幼、大与小、病与健、快与慢、孕畜与非孕畜分开）的饲养管理方法。抓住青草旺盛季节和作物收获季节开展了群众性的采集饲草运动，一年来除满足饲养外，全县还收存起各种饲草四亿多斤。按1960年发展耕畜八万五千头，每头五千斤草计算，饲草还有剩余。
    （三）抓防疫，确保牲畜健康发展。县有畜牧防疫站，生产队有防疫组，除配备了一定数量的兽医技术人员，培养训练了大批群众防疫员外，并充分发挥了民间中兽医的作用。抓住了防、疫、治三关，大力开展了群众性的防疫运动。在防字上，主要是牲畜栏圈经常打扫，饲养用具经常洗刷消毒；一年三次给牲畜打防疫针；改良栏圈，使畜舍达到向阳、通风、透光的要求。仅1959年，全县即改良、修补和新建了栏圈七万多间，冬季作好了畜舍保暖工作，使牲畜安全过冬。在疫字上，主要加强疫情控制，采取三统（统一领导，统一组织，统一行动），五员（防疫员、饲养员、卫生员、税务员、交易员）大协作的方法，分片包干，逐头检查的措施。在治字上，是发现病畜立即隔离治疗，发动群众检查和监督病、死畜的加工和深埋。由于采取以上措施，有效的防止和消灭了牲畜疫病，从1957年到现在，全县已连续三年无畜疫发生。
      （四）加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。县、公社都建立了畜牧生产办公室，生产队建立了饲养管理委员会或小组，各级党委都有专职书记亲自挂帅，对这一工作抓得紧、抓得实。县委重点抓住了耕畜发展较快的下村、仲村等公社，具体帮助他们在各项工作中先行一步，做出样子，召开现场会议，普遍推广。有计划地发动社与社、队与队之间开展红旗竞赛运动，举办评奖大会。1959年上半年全县共评比奖励了养畜多、繁殖快、无病疫的生产队四十二个，优秀饲养员、配种员、防疫员一千余人。县委还举办了三十四期训练班，培训各种技术人材一千四百余名，壮大了技术队伍，有力的推动了畜牧生产的不断跃进。
    大辛店公社建畜产院
    大辛店人民公社在蓬莱县东南部，是一个半丘陵地区。全社现有耕畜四千九百八十六头，其中适龄母畜一千八百零七头，已配种怀胎一千七百零四头，满怀率94.4％。该社以前对保胎产仔重视不够，1958年流产率占40％。
    公社党委为了改变这种状况，于1959年5月份建立了畜产院，至1960年1月份共收容孕畜一百五十六头，产仔畜一百五十六只，全部饲养成活。畜产院备有纱布、剪刀、碘酒、莱苏儿等新法接生常用的药品和器械。接产员兼饲养员。孕畜于产前五天至十天入院，由核算单位自带草料。年老母畜于产后六天、幼年母畜于产后八天开始配种，直配至产后十二天至十五天配准出院。经产院接产的一百五十六头母畜实行热配后，准胎率达97％。
    这个畜产院还制定了科学的饲养护理制度。牲畜入院即做到“一定”“二消”“三检查”“四注意”等。“一定”即：固定专人管理；“二消”：产房、接生器械消毒；“三检查”：检查阴门流液，检查乳房膨大，检查饮水后的胎动；“四注意”：注意母畜动态、母畜习性、食欲变化、后躯浮肿。临产前做到“三准备”，即：准备消毒药、垫草、小米粥或麸皮水；接产做到“三及时”：及时解开缰绳，剪断脐带，擦干仔畜周身粘液；产后要帮助仔畜站立、防止便泌等。倘发现母畜阴门流出恶臭粘液，就用消毒药液洗涤膣腔；如有仔畜便泌，就喂点轻泄剂；如有母畜不爱仔畜，就按抚母畜助其爱仔。
    畜产院的好处很多：第一，为耕畜繁殖创造了良好条件；第二，便于推广新法接生，保证怀胎母畜全产，仔畜全活；第三，保证产后母畜不误配种时间，准时配种怀胎；第四，保证怀胎母畜产前、产后有充足的休养时间和有较充分的营养；第五，减少各生产队照顾母畜生产所耗费的精力和时间。
    目前这个社有受胎母畜一千七百零四头，计划全部进产院生产，确保母畜安全产仔全成活。
    汶上办牲畜疗养院
    汶上县委为改变冬季耕畜瘦弱死亡的情况，去年冬季组织力量，进行全县耕畜大检查，发现有病弱牲畜六百四十九头。为了使这些牲畜及时恢复健康，在全县建立牲畜疗养院七十九处，收容病畜三百五十三头，弱畜二百九十六头。经过精心喂养和治疗，截至今年2月中旬，已有三百零五头牲畜恢复健康。
    沙河站公社党委专派张来宾书记和王福坤社长在乔村大队牲畜疗养院亲自摸索经验。他们在牲畜疗养院集中病畜七头、老弱畜九头，采取了三包到院的办法（即坚强的指导干部到院包管理，有治疗防疫经验的兽医防疫员到院包治病防疫，有优秀的饲养员到院包饲养牲畜），一定要把瘦弱牲畜饲养好。在护理上作到了三定（定人员、定草料、定增膘恢复期），四知（知饥、知饱、知冷、知热），三勤（手勤、眼勤、腿勤），六净（草净、料净、栏净、槽净、畜体净、牲畜场净）。由于采取了以上措施，该院疗养的十六头牲畜已普遍增膘一成。由于在喂养中施行粗料细喂，精心调制，多样适口，牲畜食欲大增。进院时驴一般每天只吃草七、八斤，后来增到每天吃十七斤，牛也由吃草十二斤增到二十斤，截至2月中旬已有九头耕畜经检查认为合格出院。
    汶上县在建立牲畜疗养院的方式上是因地制宜，多种多样。如次丘公社采取了社建病畜院，大队建老残瘦弱院。凡需进病院的牲畜，事先经兽医人员检查批准，后送公社病畜院治疗；治愈后仍很瘦弱的牲畜，再送到大队疗养院进行较长时期的疗养。南站公社除建立病院和疗养院外，还专门建立了疥癣病畜隔离院，集中所有疥癣牛施行隔离饲养治疗。
