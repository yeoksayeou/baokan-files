Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st – West German Chancellor Adenauer, who is currently visiting Japan, openly clamored today that Japan and West Germany need to "unite more closely as intimate friends to fight against communism."

Adenauer made these remarks, indicating his intention to revive the "anti-communist alliance" of Japanese and German militarists of the past under the instruction of the United States to serve the United States, during a speech to a joint session of both houses of the Japanese Diet this afternoon. He said that Japan and West Germany are both "at the forefront of opposing communism" in the East and the West. "Politicians and scholars of both countries should jointly conduct the anti-communist struggle." He also clamored that "it may take a long time to achieve a result in this anti-communist struggle, and the anti-communist crusade is the responsibility of the German and Japanese people."

Adenauer also said, "I will soon consult with the Japanese ambassador to Bonn to discuss the details of this cooperation."

Adenauer also exposed his conspiracy to obstruct the summit meeting. He said that "free people" should "control" the upcoming summit meeting.

Adenauer blatantly advocated that Japan and West Germany should step up their arms expansion and war preparations. He said that Japan and West Germany should not be "satisfied with" the existing rearmament.

Shiga Yoshio, leader of the Japanese Communist Party's Diet members' group, criticized Adenauer for making an anti-communist, militaristic speech in the Diet.

Shiga Yoshio pointed out that Adenauer's speech was reminiscent of the past Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and exposed his own persistence in militarist policies that violate the global trend of peace.

Shiga Yoshio criticized Kishi Nobusuke for allowing Adenauer to make such a vicious speech in the Japanese Diet.

The Japanese Socialist Party today opposed playing the national anthems of West Germany and Japan before Adenauer's speech in the Japanese Diet. It pointed out that this would be "a reminiscence of the wartime German-Japanese treaty against international communism."

Adenauer also met with former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida for two hours yesterday. According to Agence France-Presse, he discussed with Yoshida Shigeru, who is notorious for his pro-American and pro-militaristic policies, the issue of West Germany and Japan "further strengthening cooperation to enhance the role of the two countries on the international stage." For this purpose, they compared their strategies.

Adenauer also discussed with Yoshida the issue of Japanese and West German monopoly capital intensifying their collusion to jointly carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia.

    想重建德日旧同盟　要成立反共十字军
    阿登纳在续编“我的奋斗”
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：正在日本访问的西德总理阿登纳今天公开叫嚣，日本同西德有必要“更加紧密地联合起来成为密切的朋友，同共产主义作斗争”。
    阿登纳今天下午在日本国会两院联席会议上发表演说时，说了这些表明他在美国的授意下企图复活日、德军国主义者过去的“反共同盟”来为美国效劳的话。他说，日本和西德在东方和西方都“站在反对共产主义的最前列”。“两国的政治家和学者应当共同进行反共斗争”。他还叫嚷，“可能需要很长的时间才能使这个反共斗争打出一个结果，而反共十字军是德国和日本人民的责任。”
    阿登纳还说，“我即将同日本驻波恩大使进行磋商。讨论这种合作的细节问题。”
    阿登纳还暴露了他阻挠最高级会议的阴谋。他说什么“自由人民”应“控制”即将举行的最高级会议。
    阿登纳明目张胆地主张日本和西德加紧扩军备战。他说，日本和西德不应“满足于”现有的重整军备。
    日本共产党国会议员团领袖志贺义雄抨击阿登纳在国会发表反共的、军国主义的演说。
    志贺义雄指出，阿登纳的演说使人想起了过去的日德意三国侵略同盟，并且暴露了他自己坚持违反世界和平潮流的军国主义政策。
    志贺义雄抨击岸信介竟让阿登纳在日本国会发表这样恶毒的演说。
    日本社会党今天反对当阿登纳在日本国会发表演说前演奏西德和日本的国歌。它指出，这将成为“对战时的日德反对国际共产主义的条约的怀念”。
    阿登纳昨天还同日本前首相吉田茂会谈了两个小时。据法新社透露，他同以亲美和鼓吹军国主义政策而臭名远扬的吉田茂讨论了西德和日本“进一步紧密合作来加强两国在国际舞台上的作用”问题。为了这个目的，他们比较了他们的战略。
    阿登纳还同吉田讨论了日本和西德垄断资本加紧勾结，共同向东南亚进行经济扩张的问题。
