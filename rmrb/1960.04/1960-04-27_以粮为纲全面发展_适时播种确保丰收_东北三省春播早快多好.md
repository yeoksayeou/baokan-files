Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: Liaoning Province has recently had widespread spring rains, and the people of the province are seizing the opportunity to rush sow. The daily sowing progress has reached more than 80,000 hectares (1 hectare = 15 mu). The sowing of field crops and economic crops such as cotton is expected to be largely completed around May 1st.

Because the preparations for spring plowing and sowing were adequate, the sowing time for various crops in the province this year is generally half a month to 20 days earlier than last year. This is not only conducive to the growth of seedlings, but also regulates agricultural work, making production activities proactive at every step.

More base fertilizer, more water, and more high-yield plots are the prominent features of spring plowing and sowing in Liaoning this year. The amount of fertilizer applied in various places is generally 30% more than last year, with high-quality fertilizers such as manure, urine, and peat accounting for 50%. Various places have also established many large-area high-yield plots and high-yield fields during spring sowing. Preliminary statistics show that the area of ​​large-area high-yield plots of spring wheat in the province accounts for about 30% of the total spring wheat area.

In spring plowing and sowing, all parts of the province have implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing, and planting more to reap more and reap high yields. About 70% of the province's land is planted with grain crops, and the remaining 30% is comprehensively arranged for crops such as cotton, flax, oil, potatoes, vegetables, flue-cured tobacco, and medicinal materials. At the same time, in order to further expand the cultivated area and plant more economic crops, the province has also launched a "small spring plowing" movement under the slogan of "utilizing every inch of land, planting more and reaping more." 69,000 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed, of which more than 20,000 hectares have been sown. Various places have also used scattered land along the edges of fields, houses, ditches, and threshing grounds to plant more than 30,000 hectares of economic crops or miscellaneous grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th: As of the 20th, Jilin Province had sown more than 15 million mu of various crops, an increase of more than 15% compared with the same period last year. A sowing upsurge, from the first plow to striving for a complete success in spring plowing, is taking shape in the vast countryside.

Spring sowing in Jilin Province this year is more timely than in previous years. In the spirit of "early sowing, early benefits," after basically completing the spring wheat sowing in early April, various places immediately started plowing and sowing the fields, about 10 days to half a month earlier than in previous years.

In order to ensure that the total output of grain and soybeans this year increases compared with last year's bumper harvest, various places have launched a mass movement to expand the cultivated area in implementing the policy of combining planting more to reap more with high yields to reap more. Now, tens of thousands of commune members across the province are reclaiming large areas of virgin land and planting abandoned land. As of the 20th, the province had reclaimed 2 million mu of wasteland. At the same time, many people's communes, in conjunction with spring plowing, have comprehensively planned the rational layout of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as grain and industrial raw material crops, and have made unified arrangements for the manpower, animal power, and materials for the whole year. Judging from the current situation, under the premise of ensuring increased grain production, the sown area of ​​oil crops and other industrial raw material crops will be expanded compared with last year. The sowing of minor oil crops began as early as early March, and the sowing of these crops is now entering a climax.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th: Spring plowing and sowing in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are generally earlier than in previous years. Last year, only seven counties had finished sowing spring wheat by Qingming, while this year 22 counties had completed sowing by Qingming. At present, the province's spring wheat sowing plan has been completed by more than 80%; the province has also sown more than 6 million mu of millet, sorghum, soybeans, corn, rice, and oil crops. Sowing rice in early April is the first time in the history of rice cultivation in Heilongjiang Province.

At present, the countryside of Heilongjiang Province is a lively scene of spring sowing everywhere. In the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, where mechanized and semi-mechanized farming accounted for 50% in 1959, the tractor fleets of state-owned mechanized farms and people's communes are pulling five-bottom plows and seeders to plow and sow the land. Trucks and small tractors pulling trailers, as well as horse-drawn carts, are continuously transporting seeds and fertilizers. While using machines for plowing, farmers are also cracking their whips and using new-style animal-powered farm implements and improved farm implements for intensive spring plowing. Almost all of the crops that have been sown in the province have been sown with these mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved farm implements. The use of modern tools for sowing has greatly accelerated the progress of spring sowing and improved the quality of cultivation.

Due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels and the concentration of superior manpower and mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved farm implements for sowing, the spring plowing and sowing situation in Heilongjiang Province this year is: more sown, faster sown, better sown, and all reached very high standards in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. All of the more than 10 million mu of spring wheat sown this year are planted on deeply ploughed land, of which 98% of the wheat fields have met the requirements of rational close planting. The amount of fertilizer applied in various places has also increased significantly.

In this year's spring plowing and sowing, Heilongjiang Province has also vigorously reformed the farming system, promoted the measures of combining large ridges into small ridges and reclaiming wasteland to increase the sown area of ​​grain and economic crops. At present, state-owned mechanized farms and people's communes have reclaimed 110,000 mu of wasteland and have begun sowing on these newly reclaimed lands. (Attached picture)

    以粮为纲全面发展　适时播种确保丰收
    东北三省春播早快多好
    辽宁
    据新华社沈阳26日电辽宁省最近普降春雨，全省人民正在抓紧时机抢墒播种。播种日进度达到八万多垧（每垧十五市亩）。全省大田作物和棉花等经济作物的播种，预计“五一”前后可大体完成。
    由于春耕春种的准备工作做得充分，因而今年全省各类作物的播种时间一般都比去年提早了半个月到二十天，这不仅有利于禾苗生育成长，同时，调节了农活，使生产活动达到了一步主动，步步主动。
    底肥多、水多、丰产方多，是辽宁今年春耕春种的一个显著特点。各地施肥量一般都比去年多30％，其中粪、尿、草炭等优质肥料占50％。各地在春播中还建立了许多大面积丰产方和高额丰产田，初步统计，全省春小麦大面积丰产方的面积，占到全部春麦面积的30％左右。
    全省各地在春耕春播中，都贯彻执行了以粮为纲，全面发展和多种多收高产多收的方针。全省约有70％左右的土地种粮食作物，其余30％的土地全面安排了棉、麻、油、土豆、菜、烤烟和药材等作物。与此同时，为了进一步扩大耕地面积，多种经济作物，全省还在寸土必争，多种多收的口号下开展了“小春耕”运动，现已开拓了六万九千垧荒地，其中有两万多垧已播上种；各地还利用地边、宅边、沟边和场边的零星土地，种植了三万多垧经济作物或杂粮。
    吉林
    据新华社长春26日电吉林省到20日为止，已播种各种作物一千五百多万亩，比去年同期多15％以上。从开犁红到争取春耕满堂红的播种高潮，正在广大农村中普遍形成。
    吉林省今年春播比往年更加适时。各地本着一早百早的精神，在4月初基本结束春麦播种后，紧接着就开犁播种大田，播种时间比往年提前十天到半月左右。
    为了确保今年粮食、大豆总产量比大丰收的去年增长，各地在贯彻多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针中，掀起了群众性的扩大耕地面积运动。现在，全省每天有数以万计的社员开垦大片的处女地和拣种撂荒地，到20日止，全省已开出荒地二百万亩。与此同时，许多人民公社结合春耕，通盘规划了农林牧副渔及粮食与工业原料作物的合理布局，并对全年的人力、畜力、物资进行统一部署。据目前情况看来：全省在保证粮食增产的前提下，油料和其他工业原料作物的播种面积都将比去年扩大。小油料的播种早在3月初即已开始，目前这些作物的播种都已进入高潮。
    黑龙江
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电  黑龙江省各地的春耕春播普遍比往年提早。去年清明只有七个县种完春麦，今年到清明已有二十二个县播种完毕。现在，全省春麦播种计划已经完成80％以上；全省还播种谷子、高粱、大豆、苞米、水稻和油料作物六百多万亩。4月上旬就播种水稻，这在黑龙江省的种植水稻史上是第一次。
    目前，黑龙江省农村到处是一片热热闹闹的春播景象。1959年机械化、半机械化耕作的面积已占50％的黑龙江省农村，国营机械农场和人民公社的拖拉机群，正牵引着五铧犁和播种机进行翻地播种，载重汽车和小型拖拉机牵引的拖车，以及马拉大车，川流不息地运送种子和肥料。在用机械耕种的同时，农民们打着响鞭，也在用新式畜力农具和改良农具紧张春耕。全省已经播种的作物中，几乎全部都是用这些机械化、半机械化和改良农具播种的。由于使用现代化的工具进行播种，大大加快了春播进度，提高了耕作质量。
    由于各级党委加强了领导，集中了优势人力和机械化、半机械化及改良农具播种的结果，黑龙江省今年春耕播种情况是：种得多，种得快，种得好，按农业“八字宪法”要求，全面达到了很高的标准。今年播种的一千多万亩春麦，全部种在深翻的耕地上，其中有98％的麦田，都达到了合理密植的要求。各地施肥量也都显著增加。
    在今年的春耕播种中，黑龙江省还大力改革了耕作制度，推行了大垅改小垅和开垦荒地并举的措施，以增加粮食和经济作物的播种面积。目前，国营机械农场和人民公社已开出荒地十一万亩，并开始在这些新垦的土地上播种。（附图片）
