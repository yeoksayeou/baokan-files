Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 1st: Representatives from fifteen Latin American countries participating in the "Week of Support for the Latin American People" in late March signed a joint declaration. The joint declaration stated, "The imperialist aggressors who are futilely attempting to stop the Cuban revolution should know that the entire Latin American continent will see the emergence of the heroic struggle of the masses, and in every country, a Sierra Maestra (the revolutionary base of the Cuban people's armed struggle against the dictatorship – editor's note) will rise to repel armed invasions and aggressions against Cuba."

The representatives of the following countries signed the joint declaration: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

The declaration pointed out, "Since the moment when imperialist invasions have increasingly subjected the people of our countries to the rule of international monopoly organizations, the revolutionary struggle in Latin America has been nothing more than a struggle for national liberation. In the face of the decline and bankruptcy of imperialism and the widespread resistance of the people in underdeveloped countries, the workers and peasants, the middle class, students, and revolutionary intellectuals bear the historical responsibility of fulfilling the tasks of the democratic revolution."

The declaration pointed out that Latin American countries are almost exclusively a backward continent specializing in the production of raw materials. The Latin American revolution is advancing along the path of the uprisings of the people of Asia and Africa, and it has become a national revolution to eliminate feudal obstacles, end the rule of oligarchs and foreign capital, and promote the interests and rights of the broad masses of the people.

The declaration pointed out that January 1, 1959, is the dividing line between two eras in Latin America. The Cuban revolution began a period of profound change, and its immeasurable importance shows that the Cuban revolution is the pioneer of the Latin American revolution and the highest expression of the Latin American struggle for people's liberation and national sovereignty and integrity. In just one year under the rule of a democratic and truly representative government, the Cuban revolution has achieved a cause of national liberation and social welfare that no Latin American country has ever achieved. The depth of the Cuban revolution and the great significance of this liberation have been manifested in all aspects of national life. But basically, the characteristic of the Cuban revolution lies in breaking foreign tutelage and implementing an independent and autonomous foreign policy.

The declaration emphasized that the Cuban revolution—the vanguard of the Latin American revolution—is being threatened by the most aggressive imperialists and their servants in Latin America. The declaration condemned the imperialist attempt to carry out armed invasions and aggressions against Cuba under the pretext of anti-communism.

The declaration emphasized that the people of Latin American countries have stood up, and in every corner of Latin America, people are uniting to prevent the recurrence of the Guatemalan incident and to defend the Cuban revolution.

The declaration called on peasants, workers, students, women, writers, artists, revolutionary democratic politicians, and all patriotic strata to fight for the liberation of Latin America. The declaration pointed out that the best way to support the Cuban revolution and clear the way for the liberation of our people is to launch a lofty and unremitting struggle where the oligarchy and imperialism are carrying out oppression, to fight for the victory of the people of Latin American countries with revolutionary unity and the defense of the interests of each country as weapons, and to combine the ideas, struggles, and experiences of the democratic and national liberation of the people of our countries.

    拉丁美洲十五国人民代表发表宣言
    拉丁美洲民族革命在前进
    号召各国人民加强团结保卫古巴
    据新华社哈瓦那1日电　参加3月下旬“支援拉丁美洲人民周”的拉丁美洲十五个国家的代表签署了一项联合宣言。联合宣言说，“枉费心机地企图阻止古巴革命的帝国主义侵略者应该知道：整个拉丁美洲大陆都将涌现人民群众的英勇斗争，每一个国家都将崛起一座击退对古巴的武装入侵和侵略的马埃斯特腊山（古巴人民反独裁武装斗争的革命根据地——编者注）。”
    在联合宣言上签字的有下列国家的代表：阿根廷、玻利维亚、巴西、哥伦比亚、智利、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉、海地、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、波多黎各、多米尼加、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉。
    宣言指出，“自从帝国主义的入侵使我们各国人民日益从属于国际垄断组织的统治的时刻起，拉丁美洲的革命斗争就不外乎是争取民族解放的斗争。在帝国主义没落、破产和不发达国家人民普遍反抗的情况下，工农群众、中产阶级、学生和革命知识分子负有实现民主革命任务的历史责任。”
    宣言指出，拉丁美洲各国几乎仅仅是一个专门生产原料的落后的大陆。拉丁美洲革命沿着亚非人民起义的道路前进，它已经成为一个争取扫除封建障碍、结束寡头和外国资本统治以及促进广大人民的利益和权利的民族革命。
    宣言指出，1959年1月1日是拉丁美洲两个时代的分界线。古巴革命开始了一个深刻变革的时期，它的无可估量的重要意义展示出，古巴革命是拉丁美洲革命的先行者，是拉丁美洲争取人民解放和国家主权完整的斗争的最高表现。在民主和真正富有代表性的政府执政的短短一年中，古巴革命就实现了任何拉丁美洲国家从未有过的民族解放和社会福利的事业。古巴革命的深刻性和这一解放的重大意义已经在国家生活的各个方面表现出来。但是，基本上，古巴革命的特点在于打破了外国的监护状态，在外交政策方面执行了独立自主的方针。
    宣言强调说，古巴革命——拉丁美洲革命的先锋，正在遭到最富于侵略性的帝国主义者及其在拉丁美洲的仆从的威胁。宣言谴责帝国主义企图以反共为借口对古巴进行武装入侵和侵略。
    宣言强调指出，拉丁美洲各国人民已经站立起来，在拉丁美洲的各个角落，人们正在团结起来制止危地马拉事件的重演和保卫古巴革命。
    宣言号召农民、工人、学生、妇女、作家、艺术家、革命的民主政治家和一切爱国阶层为争取拉丁美洲的解放而斗争。宣言指出，支持古巴革命和扫清我们各国人民解放道路的最好方式就是在寡头势力和帝国主义进行压迫的地方展开崇高和不懈的斗争，以革命团结和保卫每个国家的利益为武器，来争取拉丁美洲各国人民的胜利，并把我们各国人民的民主和民族解放的思想、斗争和经验结合起来。
