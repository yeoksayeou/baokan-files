Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: National People's Congress deputies today expressed their determination to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, vigorously support the development of agriculture in all aspects, ensure the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, and strive for continued leaps forward in agriculture this year.

Deputies held a full day of general discussions today. They warmly endorsed the report made by Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin at yesterday's meeting. Many representatives from the agricultural front spoke about the current excellent situation in agriculture and the unparalleled power of the people's communes in promoting the high-speed development of agriculture. They expressed full confidence in achieving the goals set by the National Agricultural Development Program several years ahead of schedule. Zhang Sizhou, the head of the Mianfeng People's Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, spoke in his speech about their commune's ambitious leap forward plan for this year. The commune plans to increase grain production by 50% to 70% compared to the year of the great leap forward, 1959, increase cotton production by 30% to 50%, and vigorously develop all other aspects of production. Zhang Sizhou talked about the many favorable conditions for completing the plan, such as the doubling of fertilizer this year compared to the past, mainly supplied by their own fertilizer factory; the renovation of a large number of water conservancy projects; the complete use of improved varieties; and the universal deep plowing of land to more than one foot. In terms of improving the cultivation system, they conducted successful experiments last year. They planted early corn in large areas of land prone to flooding, harvested early, and left the rainy season behind. After the rainy season, they rushed to plant winter corn and vegetables. As a result, land that had previously yielded nothing also achieved a bumper harvest, with a yield equivalent to 1,500 jin of raw grain per mu. In terms of cotton production, Zhang Sizhou talked about their interesting technical creations. The commune adopted the method of raising seedlings with "ground fire cages," achieving early sowing, early transplanting, and late stalk pulling. This extended the flowering period from the past ninety days to more than one hundred and eighty days. In the past, they only harvested summer bolls; now, they harvest summer, autumn, and late-autumn bolls, and the cotton bolls grow large, some as big as oranges. Zhang Sizhou said that this year, 80% of their commune's cotton is being planted using "ground fire cages," and the cultivated cotton seedlings began to be transplanted in January. They have already grown seven or eight true leaves and will soon begin to flower.

During the winter and spring, a vigorous water conservancy construction movement swept the country, with a peak of over 77 million laborers participating. To date, the completed projects can expand and improve the irrigated area by more than 260 million mu. This situation was discussed by Xu Kai, chief engineer of the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, in his speech. Xu Kai said that all localities are continuing their efforts to achieve the goals of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural water conservancy, Xu Kai emphasized that in the future, special attention should be paid to solving the problem of water sources in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and to vigorously conserve water. To this end, he suggested that measures such as preventing canal leakage, improving irrigation technology, adopting a reasonable irrigation system, and implementing planned water use should be taken in the future to fully utilize the potential of water resources.

In today's general discussion, many deputies talked about vigorously developing animal husbandry. Liu Mingbang, the procurator of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate, gave a speech entitled "Developing Pig Raising at High Speed." He said that a new upsurge of a mass movement to develop pig raising by the whole party and the whole people has rapidly taken shape throughout Henan Province. Pig farms with tens of thousands, thousands, and hundreds of pigs have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and the number of live pigs has increased sharply. By the end of February 1960, the province's live pig inventory had reached 18 million heads. Linru County and 43 other people's communes had reached one pig per mu of land; twelve counties and more than one hundred communes had reached an average of one pig per person. Yang Fuxing, the deputy governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, used the facts of Gansu Province to emphasize that the development of animal husbandry can be achieved at a high speed. In the last four months of last year, the province increased its number of live pigs by 690,000 heads and its number of large livestock by 290,000 heads. The high-speed development of animal husbandry has brought many benefits. Currently, more than 40% of the fertilizer needed for agricultural production in Gansu Province is supplied by animal husbandry. It also increases the number of draft animals for agriculture by an average of 50,000 heads each year, which has powerfully promoted the development of agriculture. Sima YiÂ·Yashengnuofu, the Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the total number of livestock in Xinjiang last year reached more than 20 million heads, a net increase of 12.38% compared to 1958. The improvement of all sheep breeds has been basically achieved, which has greatly improved the quantity and quality of livestock products. He said that this year, the autonomous region will continue to implement the policy of combining the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and plans to increase the number of various livestock by 3 million heads compared to 1959.

"Long Live the Public Canteens," was the title of today's speech by Liu Wenshu, director of the Welfare Office of the Henan Provincial Party Committee. Liu Wenshu said that there are now more than 330,000 rural public canteens in Henan Province, and 99% of the rural population participates in the public canteens. These public canteens have been operating better and better after more than a year or two of testing. Due to the establishment of public canteens and other collective welfare undertakings, more than 10 million women in the province have been liberated from household labor and have participated in agricultural production and other social labor. Lu Hongbin, a well-known agricultural labor model in Shandong, praised the public canteens in his speech for having ten major benefits: further consolidating and improving the organization of the people's communes; guaranteeing labor time and improving labor efficiency; arranging life in a planned way, saving grain and firewood; enhancing the collective concept of commune members, promoting harmony and unity in commune members' families, and creating favorable conditions for technological revolution and tool reform; providing a solid foundation for the "five guarantees" households and single men, and promoting the great development of other collective welfare undertakings; promoting the development of cultural and recreational activities; and facilitating close contact between leading cadres and the masses and facilitating guidance of production movements.

Representatives from commercial and cultural and educational departments all proposed to vigorously support the development of agriculture from all aspects. They believe that this is a major measure to promote the overall leap forward in agriculture, strive for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and consolidate and develop the people's communes. Vice Minister of Commerce Zeng Chuanliu said that doing a good job in supplying agricultural production materials and promoting the high-speed development of agricultural production is an important political task of the commercial departments. From the beginning of this year to mid-March, the commercial departments supplied agricultural production materials worth 2.222 billion yuan to rural people's communes, an increase of 51% over the same period last year. He said that the relationship between commercial departments and rural people's communes is by no means a simple buying and selling relationship. It should be the logistics department of agricultural production, the bridge between industry and agriculture, and the link between urban and rural areas.

Zeng Chuanliu said that, in addition, commercial departments must also help rural people's communes to run industries on a large scale, using local materials, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally. They must also actively carry out the procurement of agricultural products and actively help communes to develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products.

Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui emphasized the importance of cultural undertakings vigorously supporting agriculture and better serving farmers in his speech. He said that revolutionary culture and art have a great effect on promoting political and economic development. A good revolutionary song can awaken millions of people to go to the revolutionary battlefield to kill the enemy and achieve victory, or rush to the production front to subdue dragons and tigers. In order to promote the overall leap forward in agriculture, cultural workers must closely follow the development of the situation in the future, do everything possible to fully support agriculture, and better serve farmers. Qian Junrui said that all professional cultural and artistic groups and professional cultural and artistic workers should formulate specific plans to serve the countryside, further develop farmers' amateur cultural and artistic activities, and in particular, do a good job in running commune cultural and art troupes, rural exhibition rooms, field culture, and canteen culture. Qian Junrui believes that the great creativity of the 500 million farmers in culture and art is the most important source for building China's socialist and communist new culture.

Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan proposed that the postal and telecommunications departments should "act as good communication soldiers for the great leap forward in the national economy." He said that postal and telecommunications workers are particularly honored to be good communication soldiers for steel, coal, grain, and cotton. In the past two years, rural postal and telecommunications service institutions have grown exponentially. Now, almost all rural people's communes, most production brigades, and some production teams can make phone calls or hold telephone conferences. The volume of postal and telecommunications business in the country increased by 45% last year, with an average of over 100 million people contacting the postal and telecommunications departments every day. There are tens of thousands of rural postal workers in the country, who deliver letters and newspapers to the vast number of farmers on millions of kilometers of postal routes every day.

Gao Zhenwu, the director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, talked about the achievements of various schools in Henan Province in supporting agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation. During the drought resistance and harvest protection movement last year and the drought resistance and wheat irrigation movement this spring, more than 4 million teachers and students participated in voluntary labor. In addition, various schools have also supported agriculture in many ways in terms of agricultural technology by running factories, conducting scientific research, and holding short-term training courses. Huang Jiasi, the president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, emphasized that the collectivization of rural people's communes throughout the country has brought new topics to the medical science community when he talked about the issue that medical science must serve production and construction. He said: Medical workers must go deep into the countryside and contribute to the completion of the major task of having a health center in every commune, a health station in every production brigade, and a health worker in every production team. Tang Wuyuan, the deputy mayor of Wuhan, said that in 1959, Wuhan organized thousands of medical personnel to go deep into the countryside, fields, and construction sites to assist in improving sanitation conditions and preventing and treating diseases for farmers.

At today's meeting, many deputies also continued to talk about the achievements of education. Wu Han, Che Xiangchen, Mao Yisheng, Chen Wangdao, Meng Xiancheng, Liao Shicheng, Wu Ruo'an, Su Buqing, Zhou Zhihong, Zuo Shudong, Xu Shou Xuan, Yue Jieheng, Zhang Bosheng, Yuan Zhengting, Ding Lude, Jin Xiru and other representatives said in their speeches that in the future, they will continue to adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, adhering to the policy of combining popularization and improvement, and promoting the continued leap forward in education.

Medical workers Zhu Futang, Lin Qiaozhi, Liu Huimin and other representatives gave speeches today on the achievements and situation in children's health care, medical science, and traditional Chinese medicine. They expressed that they must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, set lofty goals, make firm decisions, further improve children's health care, and strive to climb the peak of medical science.

Other representatives who spoke at today's meeting included Rong Gaotang, Tang Liyan, Zha Xi Wangxu, Xu Jiarui, Wang Shaoyan, Liu Shuqing, Zhang Tianfang, Gao Shiqi, Wang Zehua, Xu Xingzhu, Lin Qiangyun, Chen Yin'nan, Xia Jianbai, Zeng Shiying, Chen Qiuan, Zhang Guoji, Lin Keming, Luo Mingyi, Lin Wenbiao, Jia Lian, Xing Zhaotang, Jia Xinzai, Hou Debang, Chen Fengtong, Su Dianxuan, Li Yanlu, Li Chuanjiang, Wang Baojing, Wazhamuji, Qian Jiaguang, Lan Tian, ââTian Jingqi, Hu Yuzhi, Cui Jiangong, Han Wangchen, Zhang Qiuxiang, Ma Sicong, Wang Kun, LÃ¼ Ji, Zhou Xiaoyan, Lang Yuxiu, Cha Yiping, Guo Lanying, Qu Xixian, Su Xin, Xiao Songli, Wang Wenbin, Zhang Jinju, Zhao Zukang, Lu Huanzhang, Hua Luogeng, Su Buqing, Chen Jianggong, Huang Rong, Li Chengzhi, Yang Kuangbao, Liu Guojun, Zhang Jingli, Pan Zinian, Ji Wenfu, Liu Yanchun, Sun Xiangyun, Shen Fengying, Liu Hongwen, Wang Tao, and He Qiantang.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: This morning and afternoon, the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continued its general discussion at the CPPCC Auditorium.

Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman, attended today's meeting.

Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made a written statement today entitled "A Great Leap Forward and Continued Great Leap Forward are Possible and Inevitable; the East Wind Continuing to Prevail over the West Wind is Possible and Inevitable." He expressed his warm support for the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin to the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress. He said that the reports of the three vice premiers filled everyone with unlimited confidence and determination in the grand prospects for national construction in the future.

In today's speech, some members talked about the situation of industry supporting agriculture and agricultural technology transformation. Zou Bingwen, consultant of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that during his visit to the Northeast region, he saw that many factories had taken important measures to support agriculture and used various methods to help agriculture realize mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy. Jilin Fengman Hydropower Station helped the nearby rural people's communes realize electrification, and the mechanical factories in Shenyang City manufactured a large number of simple lathes and diesel engines for irrigation needed by the commune-run industries. Zeng Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Federation, said that she saw when inspecting the Taipu River water conservancy project in Jiangsu Province that the tools, machines, rails, etc. supplied by the industrial departments played a great role in the technological innovation of water conservancy construction. Member Tao Jinchu said when introducing the production achievements of the mechanized farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps that state-owned farms with modern equipment should become pioneers in agricultural technology transformation and help the people's communes realize agricultural technology transformation.

Lang Yuxiu, Liu Luyin, Wu Peiying, and Lu Xiu from Sichuan said in a joint speech that their deepest feeling during their inspection of the rural areas of Sichuan Province was that the whole party and the whole people are of one heart and one mind, forming a torrent of comprehensive and sustained leaps forward. This torrent flows into every commune, every production team, every farmer, every person, every kind of work, and every thing. They said that this torrent has made the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution blossom everywhere in the countryside. Lezhi County alone has created more than 150,000 improved farm tools and new farm tools. The farmers sang praises: The new farm tools are really good, they are easy to use and light, they are efficient and save effort, everyone uses new farm tools, why worry about not doing a good job in production, thank the good leadership of the party. Wang Yuxian, Li Chuanjiang, Wu Xuezhou, Tang Aoqing, Zhang Dexin, Wang Daheng, Wu Xuelin, Zhang Deqing, Huang Shupei, and Bao Jianqing, who work in Jilin Province, said in a joint speech that the people's communes have demonstrated great superiority in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, so scientific and technological research has been rapidly developed in the countryside. More than 86% of the people's communes in Jilin Province have established grass-roots organizations of the Science and Technology Popularization Association, and have carried out scientific research focusing on the production tasks of various periods, successfully researching a large number of new farm tools, native pesticides, native fertilizers, and many excellent varieties of crops, and cultivating a large number of technical talents.

Wang Hanjie, director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, said that the people's communes have changed the face of Jinjiang County, one of the main overseas Chinese dependents areas in China's Fujian Province. Before liberation, because the people were living in poverty, a large number of people abandoned their wives and children every year to make a living overseas. Since liberation, especially after the realization of the people's communes, tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects of industry, agriculture, fishery, culture, education, health, and transportation. Last year, grain production achieved a thousand-jin county (one thousand jin per mu), removing the label of a grain-deficient county; industry ended the history of "not having an inch of iron," and now it can produce products such as generators, cement, and chemical fertilizers; the education sector has achieved that every commune has a middle school and every team has a primary school. Now, everyone in the county has food and clothing, has work to do, and lives in peace and contentment. The good days that the people in the overseas Chinese hometown have been looking forward to for thousands of years have been realized.

Liu Huixian and Li Baosen, two members from Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, used the great achievements made by the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin City in all aspects over the past year to illustrate that the urban people's commune showed unparalleled superiority and strong vitality in the initial pilot stage. This people's commune, composed of state-owned factories, commune-run industries, agricultural production brigades, and street residents, due to the comprehensive implementation of a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, completed the national production plan 62 days ahead of schedule in 1959, and the total output value increased by 64% on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, of which the output value of commune-run industries increased by 1.2 times; agricultural production, with the support of industry and other sectors, overcame natural disasters such as freezing, wind, drought, disease, and insects, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations also increased by 86% compared with the great leap forward in 1958; the commune grasped production with one hand and life with the other, and built a service network and health network with a complete system; the cultural and educational undertakings have also been greatly developed. This year, the Xiangfang People's Commune is in a situation of continuous and comprehensive leap forward. Industrial production has completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule; agricultural production is realizing the leap forward plan of developing 10,000-mu, 10,000-jin vegetable experimental fields and other ten "plans"; a commune-wide cultural education network and scientific and technological research network, which are adapted to the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, are also being rapidly established.

Zhang Chukun, Deputy Mayor of Xiamen City, described the excellent situation of amateur education in Xiamen City. He said that Xiamen has formed a one-stop amateur education system from literacy classes to colleges, with about 240,000 people studying in various schools, accounting for more than 40% of the city's population. Member Huang Muru (Tujia nationality) said that the education cause of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province is moving forward with giant strides. Now the entire autonomous prefecture has a complete primary school in every commune and an initial primary school in every team. The number of middle school students of various ethnic groups has increased from more than 4,800 in 1957 to more than 11,000, and the number of primary school students of various ethnic groups has increased from more than 92,000 in 1957 to more than 125,000.

Members Wu Yiqiu, Jiao Mingluan, and Zhu Sui from Anhui Province jointly introduced the great achievements of Anhui Province in eliminating endemic diseases, especially in preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, in the patriotic health movement. Schistosomiasis is a kind of endemic disease that is the most harmful and widely prevalent in Anhui Province. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government ignored the life and death of the people and did not pay attention to schistosomiasis at all, resulting in the tragic scene of "thousands of villages are desolate, and ten thousand households are singing ghosts." After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the people of the province to conduct comprehensive prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Sending away the god of plague everywhere in the province, there has emerged a new atmosphere of longevity and prosperity.

Theater figures Xiong Foxi, Chen Qitong, Sun Weishi, and Yu Lan jointly said that as the times are leaping forward, drama workers can become proletarian literary and artistic fighters only by persisting in continuous ideological reform. Drama workers should hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and enthusiastically and vividly express the noble moral character and communist qualities of the heroes of today. Gui opera actor Yin Xi introduced the prosperous scene of minority drama in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He said that under the leadership and care of the Party, Zhuang opera has developed from a simple form to a complete scale; Miao, Dong, Mulam, and Maonan nationalities have also created their own drama types. At present, all special zones and counties have cultural and art troupes, and all communes, factories, mines, and most production teams have amateur drama troupes. He said that professional drama troupes often go to the countryside and factories to integrate with workers, peasants and soldiers more extensively, and have created many excellent plays that express the revolutionary history and the current people's struggle to build socialism.

Members Wang Shao'ao, Yang Yizhou, Guo Xiuzhen, Xi Wenguang, Ding Zuocheng, Tang Junyuan, Sun Ding, Li Zhen, Chen Tie, Chen Kefei, and Peng Jieru all talked about the need to accelerate ideological reform under the excellent situation. Wang Shao'ao, vice chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that the current situation is very good, and the development of the objective situation has put forward the requirement of accelerating ideological reform for bourgeois intellectuals. Intellectuals must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform their positions, viewpoints, and methods. At the same time, actively strive to participate in labor exercises, learn the noble qualities of the working people, and cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people.

Chu Tunan, president of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that in the past ten years, more than 120 countries and regions around the world have had friendly exchanges and cultural ties with our country. Last year, leaders and outstanding people from 87 countries gathered in Beijing to celebrate our country's National Day. This shows that the Chinese people have friends all over the world, and the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction have had a wide and far-reaching impact internationally, and it is also a great victory for our government's peaceful diplomacy.

Among the 75 people who spoke at today's conference, there were also Hou Debang, Zhang Muyao, Jin Xuecheng, Wu Xianwen, Wu Dejian, Zhang Zhenhan, Sun Youqiao, Xue Dubi, Wu Hexuan, Huang Qihan, Wu Jiaxiang, Pan Chengxiao, Jin Tongyin, Liu Enlan, Xu Jiepan, Lu Qingjun, Zhou Mingxi, Sun Benwang, Zhang Shuzu, Qian Lingxi, Yan Fuqing, Shen Kefei, Wang Shuzhen, Hu Maolian, Dong Shouyi, Liang Shuming, Shen Zhiyuan, Luo Renyi, Dong Weichuan, Sheng Tongsheng, Huang Shaohong, and Zhang Naiqi.
