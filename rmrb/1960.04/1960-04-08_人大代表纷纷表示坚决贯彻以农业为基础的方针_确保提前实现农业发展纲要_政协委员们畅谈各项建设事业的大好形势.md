Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: National People's Congress deputies today expressed their determination to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, vigorously support the development of agriculture in all aspects, ensure the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, and strive for continued leaps forward in agriculture this year.

Deputies held a full day of general discussions today. They warmly endorsed the report made by Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin at yesterday's meeting. Many representatives from the agricultural front spoke about the current excellent situation in agriculture and the unparalleled power of the people's communes in promoting the high-speed development of agriculture. They expressed full confidence in achieving the goals set by the National Agricultural Development Program several years ahead of schedule. Zhang Sizhou, the head of the Mianfeng People's Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, spoke in his speech about their commune's ambitious leap forward plan for this year. The commune plans to increase grain production by 50% to 70% compared to the year of the great leap forward, 1959, increase cotton production by 30% to 50%, and vigorously develop all other aspects of production. Zhang Sizhou talked about the many favorable conditions for completing the plan, such as the doubling of fertilizer this year compared to the past, mainly supplied by their own fertilizer factory; the renovation of a large number of water conservancy projects; the complete use of improved varieties; and the universal deep plowing of land to more than one foot. In terms of improving the cultivation system, they conducted successful experiments last year. They planted early corn in large areas of land prone to flooding, harvested early, and left the rainy season behind. After the rainy season, they rushed to plant winter corn and vegetables. As a result, land that had previously yielded nothing also achieved a bumper harvest, with a yield equivalent to 1,500 jin of raw grain per mu. In terms of cotton production, Zhang Sizhou talked about their interesting technical creations. The commune adopted the method of raising seedlings with "ground fire cages," achieving early sowing, early transplanting, and late stalk pulling. This extended the flowering period from the past ninety days to more than one hundred and eighty days. In the past, they only harvested summer bolls; now, they harvest summer, autumn, and late-autumn bolls, and the cotton bolls grow large, some as big as oranges. Zhang Sizhou said that this year, 80% of their commune's cotton is being planted using "ground fire cages," and the cultivated cotton seedlings began to be transplanted in January. They have already grown seven or eight true leaves and will soon begin to flower.

During the winter and spring, a vigorous water conservancy construction movement swept the country, with a peak of over 77 million laborers participating. To date, the completed projects can expand and improve the irrigated area by more than 260 million mu. This situation was discussed by Xu Kai, chief engineer of the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, in his speech. Xu Kai said that all localities are continuing their efforts to achieve the goals of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural water conservancy, Xu Kai emphasized that in the future, special attention should be paid to solving the problem of water sources in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and to vigorously conserve water. To this end, he suggested that measures such as preventing canal leakage, improving irrigation technology, adopting a reasonable irrigation system, and implementing planned water use should be taken in the future to fully utilize the potential of water resources.

In today's general discussion, many deputies talked about vigorously developing animal husbandry. Liu Mingbang, the procurator of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate, gave a speech entitled "Developing Pig Raising at High Speed." He said that a new upsurge of a mass movement to develop pig raising by the whole party and the whole people has rapidly taken shape throughout Henan Province. Pig farms with tens of thousands, thousands, and hundreds of pigs have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and the number of live pigs has increased sharply. By the end of February 1960, the province's live pig inventory had reached 18 million heads. Linru County and 43 other people's communes had reached one pig per mu of land; twelve counties and more than one hundred communes had reached an average of one pig per person. Yang Fuxing, the deputy governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, used the facts of Gansu Province to emphasize that the development of animal husbandry can be achieved at a high speed. In the last four months of last year, the province increased its number of live pigs by 690,000 heads and its number of large livestock by 290,000 heads. The high-speed development of animal husbandry has brought many benefits. Currently, more than 40% of the fertilizer needed for agricultural production in Gansu Province is supplied by animal husbandry. It also increases the number of draft animals for agriculture by an average of 50,000 heads each year, which has powerfully promoted the development of agriculture. Sima Yi·Yashengnuofu, the Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the total number of livestock in Xinjiang last year reached more than 20 million heads, a net increase of 12.38% compared to 1958. The improvement of all sheep breeds has been basically achieved, which has greatly improved the quantity and quality of livestock products. He said that this year, the autonomous region will continue to implement the policy of combining the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and plans to increase the number of various livestock by 3 million heads compared to 1959.

"Long Live the Public Canteens," was the title of today's speech by Liu Wenshu, director of the Welfare Office of the Henan Provincial Party Committee. Liu Wenshu said that there are now more than 330,000 rural public canteens in Henan Province, and 99% of the rural population participates in the public canteens. These public canteens have been operating better and better after more than a year or two of testing. Due to the establishment of public canteens and other collective welfare undertakings, more than 10 million women in the province have been liberated from household labor and have participated in agricultural production and other social labor. Lu Hongbin, a well-known agricultural labor model in Shandong, praised the public canteens in his speech for having ten major benefits: further consolidating and improving the organization of the people's communes; guaranteeing labor time and improving labor efficiency; arranging life in a planned way, saving grain and firewood; enhancing the collective concept of commune members, promoting harmony and unity in commune members' families, and creating favorable conditions for technological revolution and tool reform; providing a solid foundation for the "five guarantees" households and single men, and promoting the great development of other collective welfare undertakings; promoting the development of cultural and recreational activities; and facilitating close contact between leading cadres and the masses and facilitating guidance of production movements.

Representatives from commercial and cultural and educational departments all proposed to vigorously support the development of agriculture from all aspects. They believe that this is a major measure to promote the overall leap forward in agriculture, strive for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and consolidate and develop the people's communes. Vice Minister of Commerce Zeng Chuanliu said that doing a good job in supplying agricultural production materials and promoting the high-speed development of agricultural production is an important political task of the commercial departments. From the beginning of this year to mid-March, the commercial departments supplied agricultural production materials worth 2.222 billion yuan to rural people's communes, an increase of 51% over the same period last year. He said that the relationship between commercial departments and rural people's communes is by no means a simple buying and selling relationship. It should be the logistics department of agricultural production, the bridge between industry and agriculture, and the link between urban and rural areas.

Zeng Chuanliu said that, in addition, commercial departments must also help rural people's communes to run industries on a large scale, using local materials, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally. They must also actively carry out the procurement of agricultural products and actively help communes to develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products.

Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui emphasized the importance of cultural undertakings vigorously supporting agriculture and better serving farmers in his speech. He said that revolutionary culture and art have a great effect on promoting political and economic development. A good revolutionary song can awaken millions of people to go to the revolutionary battlefield to kill the enemy and achieve victory, or rush to the production front to subdue dragons and tigers. In order to promote the overall leap forward in agriculture, cultural workers must closely follow the development of the situation in the future, do everything possible to fully support agriculture, and better serve farmers. Qian Junrui said that all professional cultural and artistic groups and professional cultural and artistic workers should formulate specific plans to serve the countryside, further develop farmers' amateur cultural and artistic activities, and in particular, do a good job in running commune cultural and art troupes, rural exhibition rooms, field culture, and canteen culture. Qian Junrui believes that the great creativity of the 500 million farmers in culture and art is the most important source for building China's socialist and communist new culture.

Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan proposed that the postal and telecommunications departments should "act as good communication soldiers for the great leap forward in the national economy." He said that postal and telecommunications workers are particularly honored to be good communication soldiers for steel, coal, grain, and cotton. In the past two years, rural postal and telecommunications service institutions have grown exponentially. Now, almost all rural people's communes, most production brigades, and some production teams can make phone calls or hold telephone conferences. The volume of postal and telecommunications business in the country increased by 45% last year, with an average of over 100 million people contacting the postal and telecommunications departments every day. There are tens of thousands of rural postal workers in the country, who deliver letters and newspapers to the vast number of farmers on millions of kilometers of postal routes every day.

Gao Zhenwu, the director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, talked about the achievements of various schools in Henan Province in supporting agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation. During the drought resistance and harvest protection movement last year and the drought resistance and wheat irrigation movement this spring, more than 4 million teachers and students participated in voluntary labor. In addition, various schools have also supported agriculture in many ways in terms of agricultural technology by running factories, conducting scientific research, and holding short-term training courses. Huang Jiasi, the president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, emphasized that the collectivization of rural people's communes throughout the country has brought new topics to the medical science community when he talked about the issue that medical science must serve production and construction. He said: Medical workers must go deep into the countryside and contribute to the completion of the major task of having a health center in every commune, a health station in every production brigade, and a health worker in every production team. Tang Wuyuan, the deputy mayor of Wuhan, said that in 1959, Wuhan organized thousands of medical personnel to go deep into the countryside, fields, and construction sites to assist in improving sanitation conditions and preventing and treating diseases for farmers.

At today's meeting, many deputies also continued to talk about the achievements of education. Wu Han, Che Xiangchen, Mao Yisheng, Chen Wangdao, Meng Xiancheng, Liao Shicheng, Wu Ruo'an, Su Buqing, Zhou Zhihong, Zuo Shudong, Xu Shou Xuan, Yue Jieheng, Zhang Bosheng, Yuan Zhengting, Ding Lude, Jin Xiru and other representatives said in their speeches that in the future, they will continue to adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, adhering to the policy of combining popularization and improvement, and promoting the continued leap forward in education.

Medical workers Zhu Futang, Lin Qiaozhi, Liu Huimin and other representatives gave speeches today on the achievements and situation in children's health care, medical science, and traditional Chinese medicine. They expressed that they must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, set lofty goals, make firm decisions, further improve children's health care, and strive to climb the peak of medical science.

Other representatives who spoke at today's meeting included Rong Gaotang, Tang Liyan, Zha Xi Wangxu, Xu Jiarui, Wang Shaoyan, Liu Shuqing, Zhang Tianfang, Gao Shiqi, Wang Zehua, Xu Xingzhu, Lin Qiangyun, Chen Yin'nan, Xia Jianbai, Zeng Shiying, Chen Qiuan, Zhang Guoji, Lin Keming, Luo Mingyi, Lin Wenbiao, Jia Lian, Xing Zhaotang, Jia Xinzai, Hou Debang, Chen Fengtong, Su Dianxuan, Li Yanlu, Li Chuanjiang, Wang Baojing, Wazhamuji, Qian Jiaguang, Lan Tian, ​​Tian Jingqi, Hu Yuzhi, Cui Jiangong, Han Wangchen, Zhang Qiuxiang, Ma Sicong, Wang Kun, Lü Ji, Zhou Xiaoyan, Lang Yuxiu, Cha Yiping, Guo Lanying, Qu Xixian, Su Xin, Xiao Songli, Wang Wenbin, Zhang Jinju, Zhao Zukang, Lu Huanzhang, Hua Luogeng, Su Buqing, Chen Jianggong, Huang Rong, Li Chengzhi, Yang Kuangbao, Liu Guojun, Zhang Jingli, Pan Zinian, Ji Wenfu, Liu Yanchun, Sun Xiangyun, Shen Fengying, Liu Hongwen, Wang Tao, and He Qiantang.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: This morning and afternoon, the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continued its general discussion at the CPPCC Auditorium.

Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman, attended today's meeting.

Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made a written statement today entitled "A Great Leap Forward and Continued Great Leap Forward are Possible and Inevitable; the East Wind Continuing to Prevail over the West Wind is Possible and Inevitable." He expressed his warm support for the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin to the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress. He said that the reports of the three vice premiers filled everyone with unlimited confidence and determination in the grand prospects for national construction in the future.

In today's speech, some members talked about the situation of industry supporting agriculture and agricultural technology transformation. Zou Bingwen, consultant of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that during his visit to the Northeast region, he saw that many factories had taken important measures to support agriculture and used various methods to help agriculture realize mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy. Jilin Fengman Hydropower Station helped the nearby rural people's communes realize electrification, and the mechanical factories in Shenyang City manufactured a large number of simple lathes and diesel engines for irrigation needed by the commune-run industries. Zeng Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Federation, said that she saw when inspecting the Taipu River water conservancy project in Jiangsu Province that the tools, machines, rails, etc. supplied by the industrial departments played a great role in the technological innovation of water conservancy construction. Member Tao Jinchu said when introducing the production achievements of the mechanized farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps that state-owned farms with modern equipment should become pioneers in agricultural technology transformation and help the people's communes realize agricultural technology transformation.

Lang Yuxiu, Liu Luyin, Wu Peiying, and Lu Xiu from Sichuan said in a joint speech that their deepest feeling during their inspection of the rural areas of Sichuan Province was that the whole party and the whole people are of one heart and one mind, forming a torrent of comprehensive and sustained leaps forward. This torrent flows into every commune, every production team, every farmer, every person, every kind of work, and every thing. They said that this torrent has made the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution blossom everywhere in the countryside. Lezhi County alone has created more than 150,000 improved farm tools and new farm tools. The farmers sang praises: The new farm tools are really good, they are easy to use and light, they are efficient and save effort, everyone uses new farm tools, why worry about not doing a good job in production, thank the good leadership of the party. Wang Yuxian, Li Chuanjiang, Wu Xuezhou, Tang Aoqing, Zhang Dexin, Wang Daheng, Wu Xuelin, Zhang Deqing, Huang Shupei, and Bao Jianqing, who work in Jilin Province, said in a joint speech that the people's communes have demonstrated great superiority in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, so scientific and technological research has been rapidly developed in the countryside. More than 86% of the people's communes in Jilin Province have established grass-roots organizations of the Science and Technology Popularization Association, and have carried out scientific research focusing on the production tasks of various periods, successfully researching a large number of new farm tools, native pesticides, native fertilizers, and many excellent varieties of crops, and cultivating a large number of technical talents.

Wang Hanjie, director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, said that the people's communes have changed the face of Jinjiang County, one of the main overseas Chinese dependents areas in China's Fujian Province. Before liberation, because the people were living in poverty, a large number of people abandoned their wives and children every year to make a living overseas. Since liberation, especially after the realization of the people's communes, tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects of industry, agriculture, fishery, culture, education, health, and transportation. Last year, grain production achieved a thousand-jin county (one thousand jin per mu), removing the label of a grain-deficient county; industry ended the history of "not having an inch of iron," and now it can produce products such as generators, cement, and chemical fertilizers; the education sector has achieved that every commune has a middle school and every team has a primary school. Now, everyone in the county has food and clothing, has work to do, and lives in peace and contentment. The good days that the people in the overseas Chinese hometown have been looking forward to for thousands of years have been realized.

Liu Huixian and Li Baosen, two members from Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, used the great achievements made by the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin City in all aspects over the past year to illustrate that the urban people's commune showed unparalleled superiority and strong vitality in the initial pilot stage. This people's commune, composed of state-owned factories, commune-run industries, agricultural production brigades, and street residents, due to the comprehensive implementation of a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, completed the national production plan 62 days ahead of schedule in 1959, and the total output value increased by 64% on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, of which the output value of commune-run industries increased by 1.2 times; agricultural production, with the support of industry and other sectors, overcame natural disasters such as freezing, wind, drought, disease, and insects, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations also increased by 86% compared with the great leap forward in 1958; the commune grasped production with one hand and life with the other, and built a service network and health network with a complete system; the cultural and educational undertakings have also been greatly developed. This year, the Xiangfang People's Commune is in a situation of continuous and comprehensive leap forward. Industrial production has completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule; agricultural production is realizing the leap forward plan of developing 10,000-mu, 10,000-jin vegetable experimental fields and other ten "plans"; a commune-wide cultural education network and scientific and technological research network, which are adapted to the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, are also being rapidly established.

Zhang Chukun, Deputy Mayor of Xiamen City, described the excellent situation of amateur education in Xiamen City. He said that Xiamen has formed a one-stop amateur education system from literacy classes to colleges, with about 240,000 people studying in various schools, accounting for more than 40% of the city's population. Member Huang Muru (Tujia nationality) said that the education cause of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province is moving forward with giant strides. Now the entire autonomous prefecture has a complete primary school in every commune and an initial primary school in every team. The number of middle school students of various ethnic groups has increased from more than 4,800 in 1957 to more than 11,000, and the number of primary school students of various ethnic groups has increased from more than 92,000 in 1957 to more than 125,000.

Members Wu Yiqiu, Jiao Mingluan, and Zhu Sui from Anhui Province jointly introduced the great achievements of Anhui Province in eliminating endemic diseases, especially in preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, in the patriotic health movement. Schistosomiasis is a kind of endemic disease that is the most harmful and widely prevalent in Anhui Province. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government ignored the life and death of the people and did not pay attention to schistosomiasis at all, resulting in the tragic scene of "thousands of villages are desolate, and ten thousand households are singing ghosts." After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the people of the province to conduct comprehensive prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Sending away the god of plague everywhere in the province, there has emerged a new atmosphere of longevity and prosperity.

Theater figures Xiong Foxi, Chen Qitong, Sun Weishi, and Yu Lan jointly said that as the times are leaping forward, drama workers can become proletarian literary and artistic fighters only by persisting in continuous ideological reform. Drama workers should hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and enthusiastically and vividly express the noble moral character and communist qualities of the heroes of today. Gui opera actor Yin Xi introduced the prosperous scene of minority drama in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He said that under the leadership and care of the Party, Zhuang opera has developed from a simple form to a complete scale; Miao, Dong, Mulam, and Maonan nationalities have also created their own drama types. At present, all special zones and counties have cultural and art troupes, and all communes, factories, mines, and most production teams have amateur drama troupes. He said that professional drama troupes often go to the countryside and factories to integrate with workers, peasants and soldiers more extensively, and have created many excellent plays that express the revolutionary history and the current people's struggle to build socialism.

Members Wang Shao'ao, Yang Yizhou, Guo Xiuzhen, Xi Wenguang, Ding Zuocheng, Tang Junyuan, Sun Ding, Li Zhen, Chen Tie, Chen Kefei, and Peng Jieru all talked about the need to accelerate ideological reform under the excellent situation. Wang Shao'ao, vice chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that the current situation is very good, and the development of the objective situation has put forward the requirement of accelerating ideological reform for bourgeois intellectuals. Intellectuals must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform their positions, viewpoints, and methods. At the same time, actively strive to participate in labor exercises, learn the noble qualities of the working people, and cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people.

Chu Tunan, president of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that in the past ten years, more than 120 countries and regions around the world have had friendly exchanges and cultural ties with our country. Last year, leaders and outstanding people from 87 countries gathered in Beijing to celebrate our country's National Day. This shows that the Chinese people have friends all over the world, and the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction have had a wide and far-reaching impact internationally, and it is also a great victory for our government's peaceful diplomacy.

Among the 75 people who spoke at today's conference, there were also Hou Debang, Zhang Muyao, Jin Xuecheng, Wu Xianwen, Wu Dejian, Zhang Zhenhan, Sun Youqiao, Xue Dubi, Wu Hexuan, Huang Qihan, Wu Jiaxiang, Pan Chengxiao, Jin Tongyin, Liu Enlan, Xu Jiepan, Lu Qingjun, Zhou Mingxi, Sun Benwang, Zhang Shuzu, Qian Lingxi, Yan Fuqing, Shen Kefei, Wang Shuzhen, Hu Maolian, Dong Shouyi, Liang Shuming, Shen Zhiyuan, Luo Renyi, Dong Weichuan, Sheng Tongsheng, Huang Shaohong, and Zhang Naiqi.

The moderators of the morning conference were: Guo Moruo, Aba Aphei Awang Jinmei, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Bing, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Chen Shaomin, Wu Han, Zhang Yun, Sa Kongliao, Sun Qimeng, and Guo Dihuo. The moderators of the afternoon conference were: Chen Shutong, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, An Ziwen, Li Dequan, Zhang Jichun, Shen Yanbing, Li Jiebo, Liu Wenhui, Chu Tunan, Chen Wangdao, Yang Dongchun, Wu Defeng, Wang Huchen, Zhao Jiuzhang, Pu Fuzhou.

The general discussion will continue tomorrow.

    人大代表纷纷表示坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针
    确保提前实现农业发展纲要
    政协委员们畅谈各项建设事业的大好形势
    新华社7日讯　全国人民代表大会代表今天纷纷表示要坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，从各方面大力支援农业的发展，保证提前实现农业发展纲要，争取今年农业继续跃进。
    代表们今天全天进行大会讨论。他们热烈拥护谭震林副总理在昨天会议上所作的报告。许多来自农业战线上的代表，都谈到了当前农业上的大好形势，谈到了人民公社促进农业高速度发展的无比威力，他们完全有信心提前几年实现农业发展纲要所规定的目标。四川省简阳县棉丰人民公社社长张泗洲在发言中，谈到他们公社今年大幅度的跃进计划。这个公社打算今年在粮食生产方面要比特大跃进的1959年增产50％到70％，棉花增产30％到50％，其他各项生产也都要大力发展。张泗洲谈到了完成计划的许多有利条件，例如今年的化肥比过去多一倍，而且主要是自己化肥厂供应的；整修了大量水利工程；全部使用了良种；土地普遍深耕到一尺以上。在改进耕作制度方面去年进行了成功的试验，他们在大片容易发生水灾的土地上，提前种早玉米，提前收获，把雨季抛在后面；暴雨季节一过，又抢种冬玉米和蔬菜，结果往年颗粒不收的土地同样获得大丰收，去年亩产量折合原粮达一千五百斤。在棉花生产方面，张泗洲谈到他们有趣的技术创造。这个公社采取了用“地火笼”育苗的办法，做到早播种、早栽移、迟拔秆，这样一来开花期能够由过去的九十天延长到一百八十多天，过去只收伏桃，现在要收夏、伏、秋三种桃，而且棉桃长得大，有的像广柑一般。张泗洲说，今年他们公社有80％的棉花都实行了“地火笼”育苗，培育的棉花1月份就已经开始移栽，现在已长出七、八片真叶，很快就要开花了。
    去冬今春全国掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的水利建设运动，投入的劳动力最多时达到七千七百万人以上，到现在已经完成的工程，可以扩大和改善灌溉面积两亿六千万亩以上。这些情况是水利电力部规划局总工程师须恺在发言中谈到的。须恺说，现在各地都在继续努力，争取提前实现农业发展纲要的目标。为了加速实现农业水利化，须恺强调今后要特别注意多快好省地解决水源问题和大力节约用水。为此他建议今后应当采取防止渠道渗漏、改进灌溉技术、采用合理灌溉制度、实施计划用水等措施，以充分发挥水利资源的潜力。
    在今天的大会讨论中，许多代表谈到大力发展畜牧业问题。河南省人民检察院检察长刘名榜以“高速度地发展养猪事业”为题发言说，现在一个全党全民大搞养猪事业的群众运动的新高潮，已经在河南全省范围内迅速形成。万头、千头、百头猪场，如雨后春笋般的兴建起来，生猪头数猛烈增长。到1960年2月底止，全省生猪存栏数已经达到一千八百万头。临汝县和另外的四十三个人民公社达到了一亩地一头猪；有十二个县、一百多个公社达到了每人平均一头猪。甘肃省甘南藏族自治州副州长杨复兴用甘肃省的事实，强调说明畜牧业的发展完全可以做到高速度。这个省在去年最后的四个月内，全省生猪就增加了六十九万头，大家畜增加了二十九万头。畜牧业的高速度发展，带来了多方面的好处，目前甘肃省农业生产所需要的肥料，有40％以上是畜牧业供给的；每年还平均给农业增加五万头左右的耕畜，有力地促进了农业的发展。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会农村工作部部长司马益·亚生诺夫说，新疆去年牲畜总头数达到二千多万头，比1958年净增12.38％。现在已经基本上实现了全部绵羊改良，大大提高了畜产品的数量和质量。他说，今年自治区将继续贯彻执行发展农业和发展畜牧业相结合的方针，计划各种牲畜头数要比1959年净增三百万头。
    “公共食堂万岁”，这是中共河南省委福利办公室主任刘文树今天发言的题目。刘文树说，河南省现在共有农村公共食堂三十三万多个，农村人口99％都参加了公共食堂。这些公共食堂经过一年多到两年多的考验，办得越来越好。由于公共食堂和其他集体福利事业的建立，全省有一千多万妇女从家务劳动中解放出来参加农业生产和其他社会劳动。山东著名农业劳动模范吕鸿宾在发言中，赞扬公共食堂有十大好处：更加巩固和提高了人民公社组织；保证了劳动时间，提高了劳动效率；有计划地安排生活，省粮省柴；增强了社员的集体观念，促进了社员家庭和睦团结，为技术革命和工具改革创造了有利的条件；五保户、单身汉有了靠山，促进了其他集体福利事业的大发展；促进了文化娱乐的开展；便于领导干部密切联系群众，便于指导生产运动。
    来自商业和文教等部门的代表，都提出要从各个方面大力支援农业的发展。他们认为，这是促进农业的全面跃进，争取提前实现农业发展纲要，进一步巩固工农联盟，巩固和发展人民公社的重大措施。商业部副部长曾传六说，商业部门做好农业生产资料的供应工作，促进农业生产的高速度发展，是商业部门一项重要的政治任务。从今年年初到3月中旬，商业部门供应农村人民公社的生产资料价值已达二十二亿二千万元，比去年同期增加了51％。他说，商业部门同农村人民公社的关系，绝不是单纯的买卖关系，它应该是农业生产的后勤部，是工业和农业之间的桥梁，是联结城市和农村的纽带。
    曾传六说，除此以外，商业部门还必须帮助农村人民公社大办工业，就地取材，就地制造，就地供应；还要积极开展农产品的收购运动；积极帮助公社大搞农副产品的加工事业。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在发言中强调了文化事业大力支援农业和更好地为农民服务的重要意义。他说，革命的文化艺术对促进政治和经济的发展有着伟大的作用，一首好的革命歌曲，可以唤起千百万群众，奔赴革命战场，杀敌致果；或者冲上生产战线，降龙伏虎。为了促进农业的全面跃进，文化工作者今后必须紧紧跟上形势的发展，千方百计地全力支援农业，更好地为农民服务。钱俊瑞说，所有专业文化艺术团体和专业文化艺术工作者，都应当订出为农村服务的具体计划，进一步开展农民业余文化艺术活动，当前特别要把公社文工团、农村展览室、田头文化和食堂文化办好。钱俊瑞认为，五亿农民在文化艺术方面的伟大创造，是建设我国社会主义、共产主义新文化的最主要的源泉。
    邮电部长朱学范提出邮电部门要“当好国民经济大跃进的通信兵”。他说邮电职工特别以当好钢、煤、粮、棉的通信兵为莫大的光荣。在过去的两年时间内，农村邮电服务机构有了成倍的增长，现在几乎所有农村人民公社、大部分生产大队和部分生产队都可以通电话，或者举行电话会议。全国在去年一年里邮电业务量增长了45％，平均每天有一亿多人次和邮电部门接触。全国有数万农村邮递人员，每天在几百万公里的邮路上为广大农民送信送报。
    河南省教育厅厅长高镇五谈到河南省的各类学校支援农业生产和农业技术改造的成就。河南省在去年抗旱保丰收运动和今春抗旱浇麦运动中，有四百多万师生参加了义务劳动；另外，各类学校还通过办工厂、进行科学研究、举办短期训练班等，在农业技术上多方面支援了农业。中国医学科学院院长黄家驷在谈到医学科学必须为生产建设服务的问题时，强调全国农村人民公社化，给医学科学界带来了新课题。他说：医务工作者必须深入农村，为完成个个公社有卫生院，个个生产大队有卫生所，个个生产队有卫生员这一重大任务而贡献力量。武汉市副市长唐午园说，1959年武汉市组织了数以千计的医务人员深入农村、田间和工地，协助改善卫生条件，为农民防治疾病。
    在今天的大会上，许多代表还继续谈到了教育事业的成就。吴晗、车向忱、茅以升、陈望道、孟宪承、廖世承、吴若安、苏步青、周志宏、左淑东、徐寿轩、岳劼恒、张伯声、原政庭、丁履德、金锡如等代表在发言中，表示今后要继续坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持普及和提高相结合的方针，促进教育事业的继续跃进。
    医务工作者诸福棠、林巧稚、刘惠民等代表，今天分别就儿童保健、医学科学和中医药等方面的成就和情况，作了发言。他们表示一定要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，立大志，下决心，进一步作好儿童保健事业，努力攀登医学科学的高峰。

    据新华社7日讯　今天上午和下午，政协第三届全国委员会第二次会议继续在政协礼堂举行大会讨论。
    政协全国委员会主席周恩来和副主席彭真，出席了今天的大会。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、政协全国委员会副主席黄炎培今天作了题为“大跃进、继续大跃进是可能的，而且是必然的；东风继续压倒西风是可能的，而且是必然的”的书面发言。他表示热烈拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理向第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议作的报告。他说三位副总理的报告，使每一个人都对今后国家建设的宏伟远景充满无限信心和决心。
    在今天的发言中，有些委员谈到了工业支援农业和农业技术改造的情况。农业部顾问邹秉文说，他在东北地区参观中，看到许多工厂都采取了支援农业的重要措施，用各种办法帮助农业实现机械化、电气化和水利化。吉林丰满水电站帮助附近的农村人民公社实现了电气化，沈阳市的机械工厂为农村制造了大批社办工业需要的简易车床和灌溉用的柴油机。江苏省妇联副主任曾昭燏说，她视察江苏省太浦河水利工程时看到，工业部门供应的工具、机器、铁轨等，对水利施工的技术革新起了很大作用。委员陶晋初在介绍新疆生产建设兵团的机械农场的生产成就时说，全民所有制和有现代化装备的国营农场，应当成为农业技术改造的先锋，帮助人民公社实现农业技术改造。
    来自四川的郎毓秀、刘芦隐、伍培英、陆秀在联合发言中说，他们在四川省农村视察中感受最深的是：全党全民一条心，一股劲，汇成了全面持续跃进的洪流，这股洪流贯注到每个公社、每个生产队、每个农户、每个人、每一种工作和每件事情上。他们说，这股洪流使农村技术革新和技术革命运动遍地开花，单是乐至县就造出了十五万多件改良农具和新式农具。农民歌颂道：新农具真正好，使用方便又轻巧，工效高费力少，人人都用新农具，何愁生产搞不好，感谢党的好领导。在吉林省工作的王玉贤、李川江、吴学周、唐敖庆、张德馨、王大珩、吴学蔺、张德庆、黄叔培、鲍鉴清联合发言说，人民公社在技术革新和技术革命运动中，显示了巨大优越性，因而科学技术研究在农村得到迅速发展。吉林省全省86％以上的人民公社建立了科学技术普及协会的基层组织，并且围绕各个时期的生产任务，大搞科学研究，研究成功大量新农具、土农药、土化肥和许多作物的优良品种，培养了大量技术人才。
    福建省华侨事务委员会主任王汉杰说，人民公社改变了我国主要侨眷区之一——福建省晋江县的面貌。这个解放前由于民不聊生，每年都有大批群众抛妻别子，到海外谋生的地方，解放以来，特别是实现了人民公社化以后，工业、农业、渔业、文教、卫生、交通等各方面都发生了巨大的变化。去年，粮食生产实现了千斤县（每亩千斤），摘掉了缺粮县的帽子；工业结束了“手无寸铁”的历史，现在能够生产发电机、水泥、化学肥料等产品；教育事业达到社社有中学，队队有小学。现在，全县人人有吃有穿，有工作做，个个安居乐业，千百年来侨乡人民盼望的好日子已经实现了。
    来自黑龙江省哈尔滨市的刘恢先、李保森两位委员，以哈尔滨市香坊人民公社一年多来在各方面取得的巨大成就，说明城市人民公社在初期试办阶段，就显示了无比的优越性和强大生命力。这个由国营工厂、社办工业、农业生产大队和街道居民组成的人民公社，由于全面地贯彻执行了一整套两条腿走路的方针，1959年工业生产提前六十二天完成国家生产计划，总产值在1958年大跃进的基础上提高了64％，其中社办工业产值增长一点二倍；农业生产在工业和其他部门的支援下，战胜了冻、风、旱、病、虫等自然灾害，农业副业总产值也比大跃进的1958年增加86％；公社一手抓生产，一手抓生活，建成了具有完整体系的服务网和保健网；文化教育事业也得到了大发展。今年，香坊人民公社正处在继续全面大跃进的形势中。工业生产提前完成了第一季度生产计划；农业生产正在实现发展万亩万斤蔬菜试验田等十个“方”的大跃进计划；同工农业生产大跃进相适应的全社性文化教育网、科学技术研究网，也在迅速地建立。
    厦门市副市长张楚琨描述了厦门市业余教育的大好形势。他说，厦门从扫盲班到大专学校的一条龙的业余教育体系已经形成，约有二十四万人在各类学校学习，占全市人口40％以上。委员黄穆如（土家族）说，湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州教育事业正以巨人般的步伐向前迈进。现在全自治州是社社有完小，队队有初小。各民族中学生由1957年的四千八百多人，增加到一万一千多人，各民族小学生由1957年的九万二千多人，增加到十二万五千多人。
    来自安徽省的委员吴彦求、焦鸣銮、朱遂三人在联合发言中介绍了安徽省在爱国卫生运动中，消灭地方病，特别是防治血吸虫病的巨大成绩。血吸虫病是安徽省危害最大，流行最广的一种地方病。解放前，国民党反动政府不顾人民死活，对血吸虫病根本不加过问，以致形成“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的惨景。解放后，党和人民政府领导着全省人民对血吸虫病进行了全面的防治工作。全省处处送瘟神，出现了人寿年丰、欣欣向荣的新气象。
    戏剧界人士熊佛西、陈其通、孙维世、于蓝联合发言说，时代在飞跃前进，话剧工作者只有坚持不断地进行思想改造，才能成为无产阶级的文艺战士。话剧工作者要高举毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，热情地，生动地表现今朝英雄的高尚的道德面貌和共产主义品质。桂剧演员尹羲介绍了广西僮族自治区少数民族戏剧事业的繁荣景象。他说在党的领导和关怀下，僮剧已经从简单的形式发展到了完整的规模；苗、侗、仫佬、毛难等民族，也都创造了自己的剧种。目前，各专区和县都有文工团，所有的公社、厂矿和大部分生产队有了业余剧团，他说，专业剧团都经常下乡下厂，深入工农兵，使戏曲更广泛地和群众结合，创作了许多表现革命历史和当前人民建设社会主义斗争的优秀剧目。
    王绍鏊、杨亦周、郭秀珍、席文光、丁佐成、唐君远、孙鼎、李振、陈铁、陈克非、彭杰如等委员在发言中，都谈到了在大好的形势下，必须加紧进行思想改造的问题。民进副主席王绍鏊说，目前形势好得很，客观形势的发展，对资产阶级知识分子提出了加速思想改造的要求。知识分子必须认真学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，改造自己的立场、观点和方法。同时，积极争取参加劳动锻炼，学习劳动人民的高贵品质，培养劳动人民的思想感情。
    对外文化协会会长楚图南发言说，十年来，全世界有一百二十多个国家和地区，同我国有友好来往和文化联系。去年，有八十七个国家的领导人和杰出人士齐集北京，欢度我国国庆。这说明中国人民的朋友遍天下，中国的社会主义建设的光辉成就在国际上发生了广泛而深远的影响，也是我国政府的和平外交政策的伟大胜利。
