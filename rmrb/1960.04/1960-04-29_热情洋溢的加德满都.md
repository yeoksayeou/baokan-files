    The towering Himalayas stretch between China and Nepal, but they cannot sever the friendly exchanges between the two countries, let alone stop the friendly wishes between the two peoples. For the people of both countries, the Himalayas are a symbol of the eternal friendship between China and Nepal.
    We have only been in Kathmandu, the capital of this mountain kingdom, with Premier Zhou Enlai for two days, but the warm friendship that the Nepalese people expressed to the Chinese people when welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai has left an indelible impression on our hearts.
    As soon as we got off the plane, we were deeply moved by the enthusiastic welcome scene at Kathmandu Airport. At Kathmandu Airport, the flags of the two countries fluttered side by side, and a portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong was hung on the colorful archway.
    Nepalese government leaders, members of parliament, leaders of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, and prominent figures from all walks of life each held flowers and garlands, ready to present them to the Chinese Premier. Ho. P. Joshi, Chairman of the Reception Committee, wore a bright silk red flower on his chest, which was a special mark for members of this committee established by Nepal to receive Premier Zhou Enlai's visit.
    When Premier Zhou Enlai arrived, nineteen gun salutes sounded amidst the thunderous applause of the welcoming crowd at the airport. Then, Prime Minister Koirala stepped forward and warmly shook hands with Premier Zhou Enlai. People remember that during Prime Minister Koirala's visit to China, the Chinese Premier and the Nepalese Prime Minister personally signed the agreement on the border issue between the two countries and the economic assistance agreement, writing a new page in the history of the development of friendship between China and Nepal, and setting a good example for friendly cooperation between Asian countries. Today, the Chinese Premier and the Nepalese Prime Minister are meeting again. This is another starting point for consolidating and developing the precious friendship between the two countries. People put garlands on Premier Zhou Enlai and presented him with bouquets, cheering and paying tribute to him, thanking him for bringing the deep friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the Nepalese people.
    We once asked a Nepalese friend: how many people came to the airport to welcome him? He excitedly said to us: "It's hard to say, because they all came voluntarily. You will see more people in the city. The people of Kathmandu and other cities in Nepal have a day off today to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit."
    Indeed, along the eight-kilometer road from the airport to the Summer Palace where the Chinese dignitaries were staying, colorful archways, colorful flags, and flowers could be seen everywhere, making us feel as if we were traveling along a colorful river. It seems that all the citizens of Kathmandu, regardless of age, have come out to welcome the Chinese Premier. When Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prime Minister Koirala, passed by in an open car, the joyous mood of the cheering crowd reached its climax. They waved colorful flags and kept shouting: "Nepali Chini Bhai Bhai (Nepalese and Chinese are brothers)!", "Long live China-Nepal friendship!" and "Wish Premier Zhou Enlai good health!" Some people sprinkled vermilion on the Chinese dignitaries to wish them good luck. Premier Zhou Enlai smiled and greeted the people who welcomed him along the way.
    Let me briefly talk about the colorful archways. Nepalese friends told us that it is rare to build so many colorful archways to welcome a distinguished guest. There are various types of archways with different characteristics. Some archways are decorated with snow-covered Himalayan peaks made of white cotton, symbolizing the eternal and growing friendship between China and Nepal; some archways are decorated with Chinese paintings and reproductions of famous Nepalese paintings, symbolizing the increasingly prosperous culture of the two countries; some archways have portraits of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Koirala shaking hands, with conspicuous "Welcome" words written in Nepali; some archways have fragrant bronze tripods placed under them, symbolizing auspiciousness. All these colorful archways were built voluntarily by Nepalese citizens, workers, students, industrialists, and businessmen. Slogans welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai are posted everywhere in the Nepalese capital by the Municipal Council, which read: "The relationship between China and Nepal is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which is not only beneficial to both countries, but also beneficial to world peace."
    The grand gathering held by the citizens of Kathmandu to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai was also filled with the deep friendship of the Nepalese people towards the Chinese people. The gathering was held at the National Stadium. In front of the podium stood a pair of bronze racks, each about one person tall, with lamps lit on them. This was to express deep affection for the Chinese dignitaries according to Nepalese tradition. In Nepal, this kind of lamp is only placed in front of the door when welcoming the most distinguished guests. When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi arrived at the venue accompanied by Prime Minister Koirala, the hosts put garlands on them. Then, a group of young girls sang newly composed songs to welcome the distinguished guests. The chairman of the Municipal Council, on behalf of the citizens of the Nepalese capital, presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a large Buddha statue and a bronze dove of peace flying in the earth's sky; he also personally put Nepalese national-style flower crowns on Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese dignitaries. Premier Zhou Enlai wore garlands and Nepalese flower crowns when he spoke at the gathering. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic cheers and prolonged applause from the more than 20,000 people attending the event. The Nepalese National Broadcasting Station broadcast the event live to the whole country. At the end of the gathering, more than 20,000 people stood up and cheered "Long live China-Nepal friendship." What a moving scene!
    Solemn, warm, and friendly are appropriate words to describe the welcome of the Nepalese hosts to the Chinese guests. Whenever Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at or left the hotel, the band would play ceremonial music and blow trumpets to pay tribute to the Chinese dignitaries. At the state banquet held for the Chinese Premier, the national anthems of the two countries were played when the host and guests arrived, spoke, toasted, and left. At the subsequent cultural evening to welcome the distinguished guests, Nepalese artists not only entertained the Chinese dignitaries with various national dances, but also performed a classical dance drama about the legend of Master Manjushri to praise the long-standing friendship between the two countries. According to legend, Master Manjushri came to Nepal from China in ancient times, splitting mountains and draining water, benefiting the Nepalese people.
    Kathmandu newspapers in various languages also warmly welcomed the Chinese Premier. They continuously published special issues, published editorials, and reported the news of the warm welcome of the Nepalese people to the Chinese Premier with large headlines spanning the entire page. Some of the titles were: "The slogan 'Nepali Chini Bhai Bhai' resounds through the clouds," "Hope, confidence, and joy are overflowing among the people," "The two countries are eager to further strengthen friendly relations." Many newspapers published photos and biographies of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi on the front page. The Nepalese newspaper "Language News" said in an editorial that the economic assistance agreement and border agreement recently signed by the Nepalese Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier "are examples of the sincere friendship between the two countries." The newspaper also said that Chinese leaders stand at the forefront of those who are making unremitting efforts to achieve world peace on the basis of peaceful coexistence.
    "Nepal News" emphasized in an editorial that Nepal very much expects that it will receive support in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The newspaper said that the Nepalese people welcome the Chinese Premier with "garlands of hope," and they believe that the Chinese Premier's visit "will make Nepal and China fellow travelers on the road to world peace." The editorial of "Ideal News" talked about China's role in the struggle against colonialism and in supporting the construction of Asian and African countries. The newspaper enthusiastically said, "Hey, good friends, please believe us, Nepal will stand completely with you in this work."
    Now, Premier Zhou Enlai is still paying a friendly visit to Nepal. There is no doubt that his visit will help consolidate the friendship between the two countries. May the friendship between the people of China and Nepal last as long as the Himalayas.

    热情洋溢的加德满都
    新华社记者　于民生　高梁　沈寿源
    高耸入云的喜马拉雅山伸展在中国和尼泊尔之间，但是它隔不断两国之间的友好交往，更阻挡不了两国人民相互之间的友好的祝愿。对两国人民来说，喜马拉雅山正是中尼两国之间的永恒友谊的象征。
    我们随同周恩来总理到达这个山国的首都加德满都只不过两天，但是尼泊尔人民在欢迎周恩来总理的时候表达的对中国人民的热烈的友情，却在我们心中留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    我们刚一走下飞机，加德满都机场上的热烈欢迎的场面就使我们深受感动。在加德满都机场上，两国国旗并排飘扬着，彩牌楼上面挂着毛泽东主席的画像。
    尼泊尔政府领袖们、议员们、尼中友好协会的领袖们和各界著名人士每人手上都拿着鲜花和花环，准备送给中国总理。接待委员会主席霍·普·乔希胸前佩带着一朵鲜艳的丝制红花，这是尼泊尔为接待周恩来总理访问而成立的这个委员会委员的特别标记。
    当周恩来总理到达的时候，在机场上的欢迎人群的雷动的掌声中响起了十九响礼炮，接着，柯伊拉腊首相走向前去同周恩来总理热烈握手。人们记得，在柯伊拉腊首相访问中国期间，中国总理和尼泊尔首相亲自签订了关于两国边界问题的协定和经济援助协定，为中尼两国友谊发展的历史写下了新的一页，并且为亚洲国家之间的友好合作树立了一个良好的榜样。今天，中国总理和尼泊尔首相再次会晤。这是在巩固和发展两国的珍贵友谊方面的又一起点。人们把花环戴在周恩来总理身上，并且向他献了花束，他们向他欢呼致敬，感谢他带来了六亿五千万中国人民对尼泊尔人民的深厚友谊。
    我们曾经问一位尼泊尔朋友：有多少人到机场来欢迎，他兴奋地对我们说：“这可说不上来，因为他们都是自动来的。你还会在城里看到更多的人。加德满都和尼泊尔其它城市的人民今天放假一天，来欢迎周恩来总理的访问。”
    的确，从机场到中国贵宾下榻的夏宫的八公里长的路上，到处可以看到彩牌楼，彩色的旗帜和花朵，使我们觉得好像沿着一条五彩缤纷的河流旅行一样。看来，加德满都全体市民，不分老少，都出来欢迎中国总理。当周恩来总理在柯伊拉腊首相陪同下乘着敞篷汽车经过的时候，欢呼的群众的兴高采烈的情绪达到最高潮。他们挥舞着彩色的旗帜，不断高呼：“尼泊利秦尼巴依巴依（尼泊尔人和中国人是兄弟）！”、“中尼友谊万岁！”和“祝周恩来总理身体健康！”有的人向中国贵宾洒朱砂，祝他们好运气。周恩来总理向一路上欢迎他的人微笑致意。
    这里稍微谈一下彩牌楼的情况。尼泊尔朋友们对我们说，建立起这么多的彩牌楼来欢迎一位贵宾是很少见的。有各种各样具有不同特点的牌楼。有的牌楼顶上装饰着用白棉花做的盖着雪的喜马拉雅山山峰，象征着中尼两国之间的永恒的、日益增长的友谊；有的牌楼上面装饰着中国画片和尼泊尔名画的复制品，象征着两国的日益繁荣的文化；有的牌楼挂着周恩来总理和柯伊拉腊首相握手的画像，上面用尼泊尔文写着醒目的“欢迎”字样；有的牌楼下面放着散发清香的铜鼎，象征着吉祥。所有这些彩牌楼都是尼泊尔市民、工人、学生、工业家和商人自动建造的。在尼泊尔首都到处都可以看到市政委员会张贴的欢迎周恩来总理的标语，上面写着：“中尼关系是以和平共处五项原则为基础的，这不仅对两国是有利的，并且对世界和平也是有利的。”
    在加德满都市民举行的欢迎周恩来总理的盛大集会上，也洋溢着尼泊尔人民对中国人民的深厚的友情。集会是在国家运动场举行的。在讲台前面竖立着的一对有一人高的青铜架，上面点着灯，这是按照尼泊尔的传统习惯表达对中国贵宾的深厚情谊。在尼泊尔，只是在欢迎最尊贵的客人的时候才把这种灯放在门前。当周恩来总理和陈毅副总理在柯伊拉腊首相陪同下到会场的时候，主人们为他们戴上了花环，接着，一群年轻的姑娘唱着新近为欢迎贵宾而创作的歌曲。市政委员会主席代表尼泊尔首都的市民送给周恩来总理一座大佛像和一个铜制的在地球上空飞翔的和平鸽；他还亲自为周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他中国贵宾戴上尼泊尔的民族式样的花冠。周恩来总理戴着花环和尼泊尔花冠在集会上讲了话。他的讲话一再被参加盛会的两万多人的热烈的欢呼和长时间的鼓掌所打断。尼泊尔国家广播电台向全国广播了集会的实况。在集会结束时，两万多人全体起立，欢呼“中尼友谊万岁”。这个场面真是动人啊！
    隆重、热烈和友好这些字眼是用来形容尼泊尔主人对中国客人的欢迎的适当的字眼。每当周恩来总理来到宾馆或者离开宾馆时，乐队便奏起礼仪乐曲和吹起喇叭来向中国贵宾致敬。在为中国总理举行的国宴上，在宾主到达、讲话、敬酒和离开的时候，都奏两国国歌。在随后举行的欢迎贵宾的文娱晚会上，尼泊尔的艺术家们不仅用各种民族舞蹈来招待中国贵宾，而且还演出了一出关于文殊大师的传说的古典舞剧，来歌颂两国之间悠久的友谊。据传说，文殊大师在古时候曾经从中国来到尼泊尔，劈山排水，使尼泊尔人民受益。
    加德满都各种语文的报纸也都热烈欢迎中国总理。它们不断出版特刊，发表社论，用横贯全页的大标题报道尼泊尔人民热烈欢迎中国总理的消息。其中一些标题是：“‘尼泊利秦尼巴依巴依’的口号响彻云霄”、“在人民中间洋溢着希望、信心和欢乐”、“两国迫切希望进一步加强友好关系”。许多报纸在头版上刊登了周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的照片和传记。尼泊尔报纸“语言报”在社论中说，尼泊尔首相和中国总理最近签订的经济援助协定和边界协定“是两国之间的真挚友谊的范例。”这家报纸又说，中国的领导人站在为争取在和平共处的基础上实现世界和平而进行不懈的人物的最前列。
    “尼泊尔新闻”在社论中强调指出，尼泊尔非常期望它将在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中获得支持。这家报纸说，尼泊尔人民用“希望的花环”来欢迎中国总理，他们相信，中国总理的访问“将使尼泊尔和中国成为在世界和平的道路上迈进的同路人。”“理想报”的社论谈到中国在反对殖民主义的斗争中和在支持亚非国家的建设方面所起的作用。这家报纸热情地说，“喂，好朋友，请相信我们吧，尼泊尔在这个工作中将完全同你们站在一起。”
    现在，周恩来总理还在尼泊尔进行友好访问。毫无疑义，他的访问将有助于巩固两国的友谊。愿中尼两国人民的友谊同喜马拉雅山一样永世长存。
