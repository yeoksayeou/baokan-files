I was greatly enlightened and educated by the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I fully agree with and support them, and I will resolutely implement them in future agricultural production.

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee, and following the successive instructions of the higher Party committees, our Xinfu People's Commune, Liuhe Management District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, achieved a great agricultural harvest and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry, animal husbandry, and diversified operations in 1959 due to the entire Party mobilizing, vigorously launching mass movements, and continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale.

In 1959, our management district, taking agriculture as the key, implemented the policy of combining industry and agriculture and adhering to walking on two legs, conscientiously implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, fully utilized resources, and vigorously engaged in diversified production, achieving brilliant achievements in a comprehensive leap forward. In agriculture, grain and potato crops covered 1,221 hectares, with an average yield of 2,250 kilograms per hectare, and a total output of 5,494,500 kilograms for the entire district. Although 34 hectares less paddy fields were planted than in 1958, the total output in 1959 still increased by 21.5% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958, equivalent to 2.2 times the total output of 1957. In industrial production, adhering to the principle of making do with whatever is available and starting from scratch, in addition to the original rice mill, four new factories were built for iron and wood repair, brick making, weaving, and flour milling. In terms of animal husbandry, 500 pigs, 229 horses, 85 cattle, 200 sheep, and 150 chickens and ducks were developed.

The actual income for the entire year of 1959 was: 379,000 yuan from agriculture; 5,300 yuan from industry; 4,199 yuan from animal husbandry; 13,263 yuan from sideline occupations; and 585 yuan from miscellaneous items, for a total income of 402,347 yuan. After deducting taxes, public accumulation, production costs, and administrative management expenses, the portion distributed to commune members was 172,463 yuan, accounting for 43% of the total income. The 333 households participating in the distribution earned an average of more than 500 yuan per household, and an average of 108 yuan and 17 cents per person. Truly, 90% of the commune members increased their income compared to the previous year. This is a victory for the Party's General Line of building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes.

We are not satisfied with last year's harvest. Based on the achievements already made in 1959, we are full of confidence and, in a fighting posture, are striving to achieve a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1960, to win even greater harvests, and to work hard to achieve the great goal of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification at an early date. We will continue to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the key, combining industry and agriculture, and engaging in diversified operations with pig production as the main focus, and strive for a comprehensive Great Leap Forward and a bumper harvest this year. To this end, in terms of agricultural production, we will expand paddy fields by another 45 hectares on the original 1,228 hectares of grain and potato crop land, reaching a cultivated area of 1,273 hectares. We will increase fertilizer application by 50,000 kilograms per hectare and apply 500 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per hectare. We will ensure careful cultivation and meticulous work, rational close planting, elimination of pests and diseases, and timely and meticulous harvesting, achieving a yield of 3,500 kilograms per hectare and a total output of 8,911,000 kilograms, an increase of 60% compared to 1959. While doing a good job in agricultural production, we will vigorously grasp industrial production. On the basis of the existing four factory settings, this year we can expand the brick factory, rice mill, iron and wood factory, and weaving factory; and build new potassium salt factory, mat weaving factory, clothing factory, and firecracker factory. We will adhere to large-scale work during slack seasons and small-scale work during busy seasons, manufacture small farm tools ourselves, and repair general farm tools. In terms of animal husbandry, the existing 500 pigs will be developed to 5,250, averaging three pigs per person; the number of horses will increase from 229 to 270; cattle from 85 to 125; sheep from 200 to 360; chickens and ducks from 150 to 5,000; and beehives from 16 boxes.

In this way, agricultural income will be 419,750 yuan; industrial income will be 201,500 yuan; animal husbandry income will be 90,000 yuan; miscellaneous income will be 1,000 yuan; and fruit tree income will be 3,600 yuan; the total annual income will be more than 700,000 yuan, an increase of 77.7% compared to 1959. The total income from industry and animal husbandry will be more than 290,000 yuan, accounting for more than 60% of agricultural income. After deducting taxes, public accumulation, production costs, etc., each laborer will average 490 yuan, the average income per household will be 730 yuan, and 140 yuan per person. More than 90% of farmers will live the life of middle or well-to-do middle peasants.

In order to rapidly realize the technical transformation of agriculture and further exert the role of agricultural mechanization, on the basis of the existing two tractors, six seeders, six harvesters, and one thresher, we will add two more tractors this year, so that 80% of the land can be cultivated and plowed by machines, and most of the weeding, harvesting, and threshing processes can also be replaced by machines, basically achieving agricultural mechanization. At the same time, we will save a part of the labor force to vigorously develop industry, vigorously carry out basic construction, and change the face of the countryside. This year, the entire district plans to build a five-room tractor garage, twenty-room factory buildings, fifteen-room clubs and public houses, and build some residential houses and other new houses of more than eighty rooms of all-brick and all-tile, thereby increasing factory equipment and having factory buildings. And achieve telephones in every team, and most teams connected to electric lights. With the great development of industry and agriculture, and the improvement of people's living standards, we will correspondingly run cultural, educational, health, and health care undertakings well.

Our entire commune members, in order to achieve the Great Leap Forward target of 3,500 kilograms per hectare this year, to create conditions for next year's production, are currently working with the momentum of overwhelming force, while doing a good job in overall work, focusing on preparing for farming, wheat has been spring-sown, concentrating on building water conservancy, actively cultivating talents, raising funds, and vigorously engaging in diversified operations, to prepare materials for this year's sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest.

In order to fully realize the above-mentioned glorious tasks, in the new year of 1960, we must actively respond to the Party's great call, listen to Chairman Mao's words, go wherever the Party and Chairman Mao point, and do whatever we are told to do. And in practical work, resolutely implement the resolutions of the higher Party committees, and conscientiously complete various work tasks. In this way, we must first strengthen branch work, implement collective leadership and give play to the exemplary role of Party members, cultivate backbones, rely on the masses, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, cultivate typical examples, establish pacesetters, continuously oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, and continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads of new and old ideology on the basis of Party rectification and community rectification, and further set off a new and greater upsurge in production.

On the basis of the victory in 1959, we must ride the waves, overcome difficulties, and resolutely achieve the Great Leap Forward targets for 1960. Therefore, our action slogan is: "The whole Party and the whole people are mobilized, men and women, young and old, do not slack off, make great ambitions, work hard, and do not relax until the task is achieved. Let us hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes and the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely advance!"

    坚决实现一九六零年跃进指标
    高凤志委员的发言
    我听到了李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和陈叔通副主席的报告，给我启发教育很大，我完全同意和拥护，并且要在今后农业生产上，坚决贯彻执行。
    我们黑龙江省绥化县兴福人民公社六合管理区在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会和省委第十二次扩大全会精神的鼓舞下，并按着上级党委的历次指示精神，由于全党动手、大搞群众运动、不断的反右倾鼓足干劲，1959年获得了农业大丰收和工业、畜牧业、多种经营的全面大跃进。
    我们管理区在1959年以农业为纲，贯彻工农并举、坚持两条腿走路的方针，认真执行农业八字宪法、充分利用资源、大搞多种生产，取得了全面跃进的辉煌成就。在农业上，粮薯作物一千二百二十一垧，平均垧产为四千五百斤，全区总产量五百四十九万四千五百斤，虽然比1958年少种三十四垧水田，可是1959年的总产量还比大丰收的1958年提高了21.5％，等于1957年总产量的二点二倍。工业生产上，坚持因陋就简、白手起家的原则，在原有一处制米厂的基础上，又新建铁木修配、制砖、编织、制粉等四个工厂。在畜牧业方面，发展猪五百头、马二百二十九匹、牛八十五头、羊二百头、鸡鸭一百五十只。
    1959年全年实际收入：农业为三十七万九千元；工业为五千三百元；畜牧业为四千一百九十九元；副业为一万三千二百六十三元；杂项为五百八十五元，总收入共计四十万零二千三百四十七元。除缴纳税金、公共积累、生产费用、行政管理等费用外，社员分配部分为十七万二千四百六十三元，占总收入的43％，参加分配的三百三十三户，平均每户收入五百多元，平均每人收入一百零八元一角七分，真正达到90％的社员比上年增加了收入，这是党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。
    我们并不因为去年丰收而满足，而是在1959年已取得战果的基础上满怀信心，以战斗姿态，为实现1960年的持续全面大跃进，争取更大丰收，为早日实现农业机械化、水利化和电气化的伟大目标而努力奋斗。我们继续贯彻以农业为纲，工农业并举，和以生猪生产为主的多种经营的方针，争取今年全面大跃进大丰收。为此，我们在农业生产方面，在原有一千二百二十八垧粮薯作物耕地面积上，再扩大四十五垧水田，达到耕地面积一千二百七十三垧，每垧增施肥十万斤，化肥一千斤，全部做到精耕细作、合理密植、消灭病虫害、割拉打及时细致，达到垧产七千斤，总产量可达八百九十一万一千斤，比1959年提高60％。在搞好农业生产的同时，大抓工业生产，在现有四个工厂设置上，今年可扩建制砖厂、制米厂、铁木厂、编织厂；并新建钾盐厂、编席厂、被服厂、?炮厂，坚持农闲大搞、农忙小搞，小农具自造，一般农具能修理。在畜牧业方面在现有的五百头猪发展到五千二百五十头，平均每人达三口猪；马二百二十九匹增加到二百七十匹；牛八十五头增到一百二十五头；羊二百只增到三百六十只；鸡鸭一百五十只增到五千只；养蜂十六箱。
    这样农业收入为四十一万九千七百五十元；工业收入为二十万零一千五百元；畜牧业收入为九万元；杂项收入为一千元；果木收入为三千六百元；全年总收入为七十多万元，比1959年提高77.7％。就工业、畜牧等总收入为二十九万多元，占农业收入60％以上。除去税金、公共积累、生产费用等，每个劳力平均四百九十元，每户平均收入为七百三十元，每人一百四十元，有90％以上的农户过着中农或富裕中农的生活。
    我们为迅速实现农业技术改造，进一步发挥农业机械化的作用。在现有两台拖拉机，六部播种机和六台收割机、一台脱粒机的基础上，今年再增加两台拖拉机，可达到80％的土地用机器耕种、翻地，使绝大部分锄草、收割、脱谷的各项生产过程中也用机器代替，基本上达到农业机械化。在此同时，节省出一部分劳动力来大办工业，大搞基本建设，改变农村面貌。今年全区计划修建五间拖拉机库、二十间工厂厂房、十五间俱乐部和公共用房，并建部分居民住宅等八十余间的全砖全瓦的新房，从而使工厂设备增多，厂房具备。并且达到队队有电话，大部分队接上电灯。随着工农业的大发展，和人民生活水平的提高，相应的办好文化教育卫生保健事业。
    我们全体社员，为实现今年垧产七千斤的跃进指标，给明年生产创造条件，目前正以排山倒海，势如破竹的干劲，在搞好全面工作的同时，集中备耕，小麦已春播，全力兴修水利，还积极培养人材，筹集资金，大搞多种经营，为今年持续全面大跃进大丰收作好物资准备。
    为完满地实现上述光荣的任务，我们在1960年新的一年里，要积极响应党的伟大号召，听毛主席的话，党和毛主席指向哪里就干到那里，叫怎么办就怎么办。并在实际工作中，坚决执行上级党委的决议，认真的完成各项工作任务。这样首先加强支部工作，贯彻集体领导和发挥党员模范作用，培养骨干，依靠群众，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，培养典型，树立标兵，不断的反右倾、鼓干劲，在整党整社的基础上继续开展新旧思想的两条道路斗争，进一步掀起新的生产更大的高潮。
    在1959年胜利的基础上，我们要乘风破浪，战胜困难，坚决实现1960年跃进指标，因此我们的行动口号是：“全党全民总动员，男女老少不消闲，立大志，下苦工，不达到任务不放松。让我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜和毛泽东思想红旗，奋勇前进！
