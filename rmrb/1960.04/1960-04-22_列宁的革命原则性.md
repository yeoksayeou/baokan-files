    Lenin's Revolutionary Principledness
    He Jiahua
    Today is the ninetieth anniversary of Lenin's birth, and working people all over the world are solemnly commemorating this great proletarian leader and teacher.
    Lenin spent his life bravely defending Marxism, defending the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, and resolutely opposing all forms of revisionism and opportunism. As a result, he was fiercely attacked and viciously slandered by all domestic and foreign revisionists and opportunists. Their hatred was sometimes so deep that it reached the point of madness. But Lenin did not waver in the slightest, and his confidence became even stronger. In a letter to Inessa Armand (Complete Works, Volume 35), he expressed this revolutionary determination very clearly:
    "This is my destiny. A continuous battle—against political stupidity and vulgar views, against opportunism, etc.
    "This started in 1893. Hence the hatred of the philistines. But I will not abandon this destiny to talk 'peace' with the philistines under any circumstances."
    It can be seen how vigorous Lenin's fighting spirit was and how firm his fighting will was!
    But Lenin's revolutionary principledness permeated all aspects. It was by no means limited to domestic and foreign reactionaries and opportunists. Even towards his own people or friends, if they made principled mistakes, he would never let them go, but would criticize them according to strict revolutionary principles in order to educate comrades and help friends. Of course, due to the different targets and the nature of the problems, Lenin's attitude and methods of criticism were naturally different. In this case, he would never use satirical and attacking methods to deal with enemies. To examine Lenin's revolutionary principledness in this regard, I can cite the following two examples about Gorky.
    As everyone knows, Lenin attached great importance to and cherished Gorky. He once gave a high evaluation of Gorky's artistic activities and literary achievements. However, during the Russian reactionary period, Gorky once approached the sectarian organization of recallism and god-buildingism headed by Bogdanov. Although it did not last long, it clearly deviated from the party's political line and Marxism. In a letter to Gorky in mid-November 1913, Lenin seriously and frankly pointed out that although Gorky opposed god-seeking, he ridiculously fell into the pit of god-building, pointing out that "the difference between god-seeking and god-building, god-creating or god-founding is no greater than the difference between a yellow devil and a blue devil." (Complete Works, Volume 35)
    Thanks to Lenin's serious criticism and enthusiastic help, Gorky finally corrected his erroneous views.
    For example, in the first few years after the October Revolution, Gorky, due to his detachment from politics, reality, and the masses, overestimated the role of the bourgeois intellectuals, but underestimated the creative spirit and great wisdom displayed by the workers and peasants after liberation; he could not clearly see the class prejudices and ideological limitations of the bourgeois intellectuals (in fact, at that time, there were still many intellectuals who secretly or even openly opposed the Soviet regime), and mistakenly believed that intellectuals were "revolutionary in essence," and wanted to persuade Lenin that "the working class's fighting party should first comfortably settle the intellectuals." This, of course, also violated Marxism, the party's political line, and the intellectual policy, and therefore was severely criticized by Lenin. In a letter to Gorky in July 1919 (Complete Works, Volume 35), he sharply pointed out that Gorky, due to his detachment from the broad masses of working people and the lively reality, was surrounded all day long by resentful bourgeois intellectuals, so that his own spirit fell into a morbid state, even becoming tired of life, and actually said such empty words as "fraternity and equality," as if the "poverty, hardship, and disease suffered" in Petersburg at that time were all the fault of communism! He warmly advised Gorky to temporarily leave the city "where there are particularly many bourgeois elements (and "intellectuals") who have lost their position (and sanity)," and go to factories, rural areas, and troops in other places to directly observe and study new people and new things, and observe and study how ordinary people are building a new life in a new way with the spirit of selfless labor and sacrifice in the most difficult and arduous struggle environment. He also pointed out that Gorky was not yet a politician with revolutionary foresight and revolutionary experience at that time, so it was easy to get lost in the direction in Petersburg at that time. An artist like him must "thoroughly change the environment, change the people he comes into contact with, change the place where he lives, and change his work" to avoid becoming increasingly depressed.
    Thanks to Lenin's serious criticism and enthusiastic help, Gorky quickly corrected his mistakes this time as well. From the above two seemingly small things (not to mention other more important political struggles and ideological struggles), we can already see that Lenin, on the one hand, seriously criticized Gorky, and on the other hand, enthusiastically helped and guided Gorky. And this, I think, is also a manifestation of highly revolutionary principledness and a noble quality unique to proletarian revolutionaries. To commemorate the birth of this great proletarian revolutionary teacher, we must earnestly learn his unwavering spirit of revolutionary principledness and unremittingly oppose right-leaning opportunism, revisionism, and all bourgeois ideas.

    列宁的革命原则性
    何家槐
    今天是列宁的九十诞辰，全世界劳动人民都在隆重地纪念这位伟大的无产阶级领袖和导师。
    列宁一生英勇地捍卫马克思主义，捍卫无产阶级的革命事业，坚决地反对形形式式的修正主义和机会主义，因而遭到了一切国内外修正主义者和机会主义者的猛烈攻击和恶毒诬蔑，其仇视之深，有时甚至达到了疯狂的程度。但列宁却毫不动摇，而且信心更加坚定，在给印涅萨·阿尔曼德的信（全集第三十五卷）里，他就曾经非常明确地表示了他的这种革命坚定性：
    “这就是我的命运。连续不断的战斗——反对政治的愚蠢思想和庸俗见解，反对机会主义等等。
    “这是从1893年开始的。庸人们的仇视就是由此而来的。但是，我无论如何不会抛弃这个命运去同庸人们讲‘和平’。”
    可见列宁的战斗精神是如何旺盛，战斗毅力是如何坚强！
    但列宁的革命原则性是贯穿在各个方面的，决不仅仅限于对国内外的反动派和机会主义者，即使是对自己人或朋友，只要是犯了原则性的错误，他也都绝对不肯放松，而要按照严格的革命原则来进行批评，以教育同志，帮助朋友。当然，由于对象不同和问题的性质不同，列宁的批评态度和批评方法也自然不同。在这种场合，他决不用讽刺打击的、对付敌人的办法。为要从这方面来看看列宁的革命原则性，我可以举出下面两个关于高尔基的例子。
    对于高尔基，大家都知道，列宁是很重视和爱护的，他曾经给高尔基的艺术活动和文学成就以很高的评价。可是，在俄国反动时期，高尔基曾经一度接近以波格唐诺夫为首的召回主义和造神主义的宗派组织，虽然为时不久，但明显地离开了党的政治路线和马克思主义。列宁在1913年11月中旬给高尔基的信里，严肃而且坦率地指出高尔基虽然反对寻神说，却同样荒唐地陷入了造神说的泥坑，指出“寻神说同造神说、建神说或者创神说等的差别，丝毫不比黄鬼同蓝鬼的差别大。”（全集第三十五卷）
    由于列宁的严肃批评和热情帮助，高尔基终于纠正了自己的错误观点。
    又如，在十月革命后的最初几年中，高尔基由于脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，以致过高地估计了资产阶级知识分子的作用，而对工农群众在解放以后所发挥出来的创造精神和伟大智慧却估计不足；他看不清楚资产阶级知识分子的阶级偏见和思想限制（其实那时还有不少知识分子暗中、或甚至公开地敌视苏维埃政权），错误地认为知识分子“本质上是革命的”，而且想说服列宁，“工人阶级的战斗的党首先应当把知识分子舒适地安置起来。”这当然也是违背马克思主义、违背党的政治路线和知识分子政策的，因而又遭到了列宁的严正批评。他在1919年7月写给高尔基的一封信（全集第三十五卷）里，就曾尖锐地指出高尔基由于脱离广大的劳动群众和生动活泼的现实生活，整天受着满怀怨愤的资产阶级知识分子的包围，以致他自己的精神也陷入了病态，甚至厌倦生活，而且竟说出“博爱、平等”一类空话，仿佛当时彼得堡的“遭受贫穷，困苦和疾病，都是共产主义的过错！！”他热情地劝导高尔基暂时离开那个“失去地位（和理智）的资产阶级分子（和“知识分子”）特别多”的城市，到外地的工厂、农村、部队中去直接观察和研究新人新事，观察研究普通人民在最困难艰苦的斗争环境中怎样以忘我的劳动和牺牲的精神，“以新的方式建设新生活”。他还指出当时高尔基还不是一个具有革命远见和革命经验的政治家，因此在当时的彼得堡很容易迷失方向，像他这样的艺术家，必须“彻底改换环境，改换接触的人，改换居住的地方，改换工作”，以免日益消沉下去。
    由于列宁的严肃批评和热情帮助，这次高尔基也很快地改正了自己的错误。从以上两件看起来似乎比较小的事情（更不要说其他更重大的政治斗争和思想斗争了）中，我们已经可以看到列宁一方面对高尔基进行严肃的批评，一方面又满怀热情地给高尔基以帮助和指导，而这，我认为也是高度革命原则性的表现，是无产阶级革命家所特有的高贵品质。我们纪念这位伟大的无产阶级革命导师的诞辰，就要认真学习他的这种坚定不移的革命原则精神，坚持不懈地反对右倾机会主义、修正主义和一切资产阶级思想。
