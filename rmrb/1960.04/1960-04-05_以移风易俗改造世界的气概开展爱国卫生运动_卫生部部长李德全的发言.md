Launch Patriotic Health Campaign with the Spirit of Transforming Customs and Transforming the World
Speech by Minister of Public Health Li Dequan

We must further mobilize the masses with a revolutionary spirit, promote the campaign vigorously, create momentum, publicize it widely, and carry out the patriotic health campaign with the great ambition of transforming customs and habits and transforming the world, and with the spirit of continuous revolution. Old people, children, young people, adults, teachers, students, men, and women should all take action, holding fly swatters and other tools, to completely eliminate the four pests—rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes—and other pests. At the same time, we must also insist on carrying out physical exercises, doing exercises during work breaks, practicing Taijiquan, and strengthening our bodies to create a new social custom.

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 draft state budget. Now, I would like to report on some of the main situations on the medical and health front since the last congress.

Achievements in Health Work Over the Past Year

1959 was a year of continued comprehensive great leap forward in China's socialist construction. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, China's health work resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, adhered to putting politics in command, implemented the combination of the Party's core members, health professionals, and the broad masses, launched mass movements on a large scale, and closely combined with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the sound development of people's communes. On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, it marched forward with great strides and achieved a great victory of continuous great leap forward.

Over the past year, the mass health movement of eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, proceeded from the development of production, closely combined with production, served production, coordinated and cooperated with all aspects, combined shock tactics with routine work, combined technology with the masses, and has been carried out vigorously, practically, wave after wave, step by step, raising standards, expanding in scale, and becoming more in-depth and detailed. Now, the four pests and diseases have been significantly reduced, the sanitary conditions in urban and rural areas have greatly improved, and emphasizing hygiene and cleanliness have gradually become new social customs, thereby greatly improving the health of the people, and effectively ensuring and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and the progress of work and study. Through practice, people increasingly realize that: being unhygienic is a disgrace, a bad habit left over from the old society; emphasizing hygiene is glorious, which is beneficial to production, work, study, and transforming the weak constitution of our people, making us healthy, cleaning the environment, and combining with the great leap forward in production, the cultural and technological revolution, which has extremely important and far-reaching significance for transforming customs and transforming the world. Many model sanitary units have emerged in various places. For example, Jishan County in Shanxi Province and Foshan City in Guangdong Province, which are well-known to everyone, are two red flags among many large-scale advanced sanitary areas. In the old society, due to the exploitation of the three great mountains, the people of Jishan County lived a life of "bran and vegetable for half a year's food," epidemics spread, people and animals died of disease, land was barren, and weeds grew, and "poor villages," "dirty villages," and "epidemic villages" were all over the county. Now, the sanitary conditions of the whole county have greatly changed. The most threatening diseases to the people, such as smallpox, malaria, relapsing fever, and typhus, which used to be prevalent, have disappeared. Tens of thousands of patients with chronic diseases have received effective treatment. The habit of loving cleanliness and emphasizing hygiene has been formed. Everyone is energetic, the labor attendance rate has increased, and production has risen step by step. Even though the county suffered the worst drought in forty years in 1959, grain production still increased by 32% compared with the extraordinary great leap forward in 1958, thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the people, and it was rated as a model county for high wheat yield in Shanxi Province. Foshan City in Guangdong Province was famous for its dirtiness before liberation. When people described Foshan, they always liked to use several "mores," namely: more individual handicrafts, more small streets and alleys with "nine bends and eighteen turns," more seepage wells and stinking ditches, more garbage and tile piles, more mosquitoes and flies, more epidemics, and more praying to gods and Buddha. From these "more" we can know that the living conditions and mental outlook of the working people in Foshan at that time were extremely miserable. Today is different. This city has gradually moved from a small handicraft city to a modern city, from a dilapidated and dirty city to a clean and beautiful city, and from a feudal and superstitious city to a city with rich national traditional culture and art, and noble civilization. People who come here to visit praise the sanitary work here and praise the speed and magnitude of the changes in Foshan's entire appearance. Under the leadership of the Party, the people here combined production with urban construction, and renovated and rebuilt more than 1,300 streets and alleys in the city in one go. In 48 days, a stinking ditch as long as 8,415 meters was transformed into a clear water river, fish pond, and scenic area; within a month, the toilets in the city were renovated and hundreds of small street gardens were built. In an instant, an ancient city became a youthful city. The habit of collective and individual love of cleanliness and emphasis on hygiene has been cultivated. The streets in the city can basically be swept and washed three times a day. The people here say, "Not washing the streets is like not washing your face, and you feel uncomfortable." They promoted "five nots": no spitting, no littering of fruit peels and waste, no piling up of debris, no dumping of sewage and garbage, and no defecating or urinating and throwing cigarette butts everywhere. The "hygienic meal" public chopsticks system was implemented. They are proud of these and regard not paying attention to hygiene as a disgrace. Because diseases have been greatly reduced and everyone is in high spirits, the labor attendance rate has increased significantly and production has continued to leap forward. There are many more health red flag areas like Jishan and Foshan in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. These areas have set a good example for eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating diseases, and have gained rich experience, greatly boosting the morale of the broad masses of people and their confidence and determination to further improve health.

Regarding the achievements made in eliminating diseases across the country, they are also very significant. Under the leadership of the Party, mass movements were carried out on a large scale, technical revolutions were launched vigorously, traditional Chinese and Western medicine were combined, both indigenous and foreign methods were adopted, and various comprehensive therapies were used. In one year, a total of more than 70 million patients with schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria were treated, and the vast majority have recovered. Adding the number of people treated in the past few years, a total of more than 5.2 million patients with schistosomiasis, more than 6.1 million patients with filariasis, more than 91.2 million patients with hookworm disease, and more than 31.5 million patients with malaria have been treated. These several diseases that pose the most serious threat to people's health are now rapidly shrinking and accelerating their elimination. Many new prevention and treatment methods have been found for various acute and chronic infectious diseases and endemic diseases, improving treatment effectiveness, and the incidence and mortality rates have been greatly reduced. In particular, a new comprehensive Chinese and Western medicine therapy has been developed for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, Kaschin–Beck disease, and trachoma, and the curative effect is very significant. A large number of patients have been cured, and the incidence rate has decreased significantly, which has effectively protected people's health and supported production and construction.

Due to the vigorous development of the technical revolution and technical innovation, the continuous improvement of working conditions, and the working environment meeting safety and hygiene requirements even more, occupational diseases and common diseases have been greatly reduced. Most of the mines and factories with dust across the country have reduced the dust concentration to below the national standards. The number of people suffering from heatstroke in factories and mines has decreased year by year, and the steel system has basically eliminated severe heatstroke. Lead poisoning and benzene poisoning have decreased significantly, and a complete set of prevention and treatment methods is being developed. This has greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor and significantly improved labor productivity.

With the continuous leap forward of socialist construction in various aspects, China's health care organizations have also developed greatly. By the end of 1959, the number of health institutions had developed to 390,000, with 570,000 regular hospital beds, an increase of more than 90% compared with 1957. In order to meet the needs of production and facilitate patients, 760,000 simple hospital beds have also been established. Now, the vast majority of people's communes have hospitals, production brigades generally have health clinics (stations), and each team has non-detached or semi-detached health workers, midwives, and nursery workers. In addition, there are also health workers who have received preliminary training in more than 3.1 million nurseries (stations). A medical and health care network centered on the commune has been formed. In collective production, labor protection has been greatly strengthened, and the "three adjustments and three non-adjustments" have been generally implemented for women's labor: adjusting to dry instead of wet during menstruation, adjusting to light instead of heavy during pregnancy, and adjusting to near instead of far during lactation. Public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens and other collective living welfare undertakings have also strengthened health management. While the health care organization has greatly developed, the health team has also rapidly expanded. In addition to millions of semi-detached and non-detached primary health personnel, the number of professional health technicians has increased by about one-third compared with 1957, reaching 1.46 million.

Following the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were implemented. The Party's leadership was established and strengthened in health care organizations at all levels, providing a fundamental guarantee for all our work. Therefore, the great achievements of China's health cause are not only reflected in the great development in quantity, but more importantly, the quality of health work has been greatly improved. The mental outlook of health personnel at all levels has greatly changed, their socialist enthusiasm has been enhanced, and their collectivist spirit and communist style have rapidly grown. In hospital work, the policy of "running hospitals diligently and frugally" and "expanding prevention and using hospitals as the center to guide local and industrial and mining prevention work" was resolutely implemented, the three-shift outpatient system was widely promoted, prevention work was strengthened, and serving patients wholeheartedly and doing everything possible to improve the quality of medical care has become a mass movement, saving a large number of patients who were previously considered incurable and on the verge of death. New people and new things in the Mao Zedong era are emerging in thousands. Some repeatedly experimented on themselves to reduce the pain of injections for patients; some guarded patients for several days and nights, without sleeping or resting; some dedicated their blood and skin to patients; some contributed their lives to saving lives and helping the wounded. Comrade Li Gong, a red young doctor from Gansu Province, is a model with such a high sense of revolutionary responsibility and a noble quality of selflessness. During his five years of work in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, he went wherever a patient occurred, and he came whenever he was needed. Service had no conditions, neither asking for remuneration nor thanks. In order to rescue a severely burned Tibetan woman, he cut four pieces of skin from his leg; in order to rescue a dozen Tibetan compatriots suffering from typhoid fever, he resolutely transfused his fresh blood, regardless of his weakness after typhoid fever. Comrade Li Gong used his blood and flesh to closely connect the Party and the Tibetan people, and was praised everywhere by the Tibetan people as a "good doctor sent by Chairman Mao." Comrade Li Gong's noble communist qualities are a concentrated representative of our thousands of advanced health workers and an extremely rich and vivid communist textbook. As for health personnel going deep into workshops, mines, fields, and construction sites to treat and prevent diseases, it has long become a common and regular practice, greatly inspiring the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. They praised: "In the past, doctors were in the hospital, now doctors are in the fields, treating diseases and publicizing, and can also work in harvesting wheat and plowing. It is really the Party's leadership is good, and Chairman Mao's kindness cannot be expressed enough."

In terms of medical education: resolutely implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor" and "combining popularization with improvement," adopting a series of two-pronged approaches such as combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining high, junior college, secondary, and primary medical schools, combining formal education with spare-time education, and combining full-time and part-time systems, adhering to three "three combinations," namely: the combination of medical education with productive labor, with mass health movements, and with traditional Chinese medicine; under the leadership of the Party, the combination of leading cadres, teachers, and students; the combination of teaching work, scientific research work, and medical prevention work, forming a new situation of medical education revolution, and it is developing more and more profoundly. New types of medical and health talents who are both red and expert are rapidly increasing. By the end of 1959, the number of higher and secondary medical colleges (including colleges of traditional Chinese medicine) across the country had reached more than 800, with more than 240,000 students (including more than 5,000 students of colleges of traditional Chinese medicine). Compared with 1957, the number of schools has increased by about three times, and the number of students has increased by about one time. In addition, there are a large number of spare-time health schools, cadre advanced training colleges, various training courses, and apprenticeships. At the beginning of this year, the number of people engaged in spare-time study in higher medical colleges alone had reached more than 20,000. This provides important conditions for the development and improvement of our health cause.

Inheriting and developing the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and strengthening the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine to create a unique new school of Chinese medicine is a major task in health work. Over the past year, due to the resolute implementation of the mass line, opposing both national nihilist ideas that disregard the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine and conservative ideas that are content with the status quo, enabling professional institutions to combine with the broad masses, learning and improving simultaneously, combining theory with practice, and combining research with clinical practice, this work has entered a new stage. The unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine has not only improved the curative effect in preventing and treating diseases and solved many problems that they could not solve on their own in the past, but also achieved new achievements in scientific research and created a good start. For example, in the treatment of difficult and complicated diseases such as tumors, leukemia, and aplastic anemia, in the study of the etiology, pathology, pathogenesis, and prevention and treatment of hypertension, in the study of the treatment rules of chronic nephritis, Japanese encephalitis, and appendicitis, and in the study of the essence of meridians and the mechanism of acupuncture, new progress has been made, and some have achieved significant results. All these facts further prove that the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine is extremely correct. At present, 37 classes for Western medicine doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine have been organized in various places, with more than 2,300 students. Many famous Western medicine experts are actively learning traditional Chinese medicine. It is certain that as long as we closely follow the Party's teachings, traditional Chinese and Western medicine will further unite and cooperate, work hard, and conquer the advanced medical fortress, and creating a new school of Chinese medicine will completely become a reality in the not too distant future.

In the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, medical science research has also developed vigorously. Due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's policy of scientific research serving production and adopting a "two-pronged" approach, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining experts with the masses, vigorously promoting the style of large-scale cooperation, and carrying out mass scientific activities on a large scale, scientific research work has blossomed everywhere. New achievements have been made in terms of quantity, quality, clinical treatment, preventive medicine, and cutting-edge science. More than 5,000 national key research projects have been completed in one year. The application of radioactive isotopes has been gradually carried out, heart surgery and a large number of vascular transplantation operations have reached international standards, China's manufactured artificial heart-lung machine has been successfully applied to clinical practice, and the cure rate of large-area burns has reached 70.2%, exceeding international standards. The experience of eliminating pests and diseases and the research on local prescriptions and folk methods have been initially summarized and mastered a set of effective prevention and treatment methods, and have been elevated to theory. Cao Yixiu's and Ma Wantai's rat-catching experience has been greatly improved after summarization. The treatment of schistosomiasis has been shortened from a 20-day treatment to a 3-day treatment, which not only created good conditions for the rapid elimination of schistosomiasis, but also established a new theoretical viewpoint of the "interrupted method." In addition, extensive drug plant surveys, nutrition surveys, hypertension surveys, and tumor surveys have been conducted nationwide, which not only provided scientific basis and important data for further prevention and treatment of diseases, but also summarized mass experience and solved many practical problems in disease prevention and treatment in a timely manner through these surveys. The development of these scientific research works has opened up broad avenues for climbing the peak of medical science.

Pharmaceuticals, equipment, vaccines and sera are important tools for preventing and treating diseases. In order to meet the needs of the people, while vigorously developing the quantity, the quality has been actively improved. In the past, we did not have some antibiotics, but now we have them; in the past, we could not produce cortisone and antihypertensive drugs, but now we can produce them ourselves; some precision instruments we could not manufacture in the past, but now we can manufacture them, and they can all be produced and supplied in large quantities, not only at low prices, but also with good quality. The production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials has also developed rapidly since the State Council issued instructions. It has not only inherited and developed the good experience and good methods of the motherland's tradition, but also created many advanced technologies and high-yield methods. In the past, many were only supplied by wild and wild breeding, but now they can be solved by domestic planting and domestic breeding. Through introduction and trial breeding, many excellent varieties have also been improved. In addition to a large increase in the number of wild collections and purchases, the planting area has increased by nearly four times compared with 1957, the supply has increased by one and a half times compared with 1957, and some varieties that were previously in short supply have basically met the needs.

Health work must advance and advance again

The most fundamental reason why China's health work has been able to achieve such great achievements and develop at an unprecedented high speed is that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance and care to the people's health and life, concentrated the greatest wishes and most urgent demands of the people across the country, combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific practice, formulated a series of correct guidelines and policies for the people's health work, and pointed out a correct path for us. The people of the whole country, following the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Party, have risen up to fight against their own illiteracy, superstition, and unhygienic habits, implemented the spirit of continuous revolution, and one movement after another, rapidly changed the face of China's health at a speed of one day equals twenty years. Now, the Chinese people are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line, they are striding forward with their heads held high, and for the continuous leap forward of high-speed development of socialist construction, agriculture, industry, transportation, capital construction, cultural education, and scientific research are all galloping forward with incomparable grandeur. The nationwide mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement has also converged into a torrent, surging, and its momentum is soaring. In such a great situation, our health work must keep up closely, advance, and advance again. All of our medical and health workers must establish lofty ambitions, firmly insert the red flag, listen to the Party's words, resolutely implement the Party's instructions, launch mass movements on a large scale, engage in technical revolution on a large scale, be loyal, and serve the great leap forward, the people's communes, and socialist construction wholeheartedly. The basic tasks of China's health work in 1960 are: to better implement the Party's general line, according to the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry and combining it with the rapid development of agriculture, closely cooperating with production to vigorously support agriculture, continue to carry out the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, driving and actively developing and improving the health work in rural areas, cities, and factories and mines, strive to complete the task of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, better protect people's health, and ensure the continuous leap forward of socialist construction.

1.  Eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases is the center of China's entire health work. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the entire people must be mobilized, everyone must take action, fully mobilize the wisdom and strength of the masses, cooperate with production, and further expand and deepen it more widely and more deeply. Significant achievements should be made in two or three years. To this end, we must further mobilize the masses with a revolutionary spirit, vigorously promote the campaign, create momentum, adopt various forms, and publicize it widely, making it clear that emphasizing hygiene is glorious and not emphasizing hygiene is shameful, so that everyone knows it. With the great ambition of transforming customs and habits and transforming the world, and with the spirit of continuous revolution, we will launch a patriotic health campaign on a large scale and engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, so that old people, children, young people, adults, teachers, students, men, and women all take action. Immediately set off an unprecedented wave of competition to catch up with Jishan and surpass Jishan, catch up with Foshan and surpass Foshan, and launch a big movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, so that the advanced become more advanced and the backward become advanced. Those in the upstream should strive again and again, the speed should be higher and higher, and the quality should be better and better. Everyone should be a pioneer, and everyone should be a model, holding fly swatters and other tools, to completely eliminate the four pests of rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes and other pests. At the same time, the southern regions must also eliminate snails, and some areas in the north must eliminate wild rats and marmots. Strive to create more four-free special zones, four-free counties and cities. At the same time, we must also insist on carrying out sports activities, doing exercises during work breaks, practicing Taijiquan, and strengthening our bodies to create a new social atmosphere.

The elimination of diseases in the south should focus on parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, and the elimination of endemic diseases should be the focus in the north, driving the prevention and treatment of other diseases that most seriously endanger the local people. The elimination of the four pests and the elimination of diseases must continue to implement the principles of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining science and technology with the masses, combining symptomatic and fundamental treatment, and combining shock tactics with routine work, fighting repeatedly, and fighting tenaciously. We will certainly eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people in the near future.

2.  Vigorously support agricultural production and further improve the medical and health work of rural people's communes. Health organizations at all levels must closely follow the needs of agricultural production development, plan and organize the deployment of cadres and health professional and technical personnel to the countryside and mountains, continue to carry forward the fine tradition of medical personnel going deep into the fields and construction sites, eating, living, and working with farmers, help run county hospitals and commune hospitals, help run training classes, and train health cadres. Vigorously assist in doing a good job in the health work of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, so as to treat diseases when there are diseases and prevent diseases when there are no diseases. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the management of feces in conjunction with production. This is a fundamental measure to eliminate parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, ascariasis, pinworm disease, and tapeworm disease. Experience should be summarized and a set of methods should be developed.

The health work of urban industrial and mining enterprises must be greatly strengthened, and the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases, common diseases, and labor protection work must be done conscientiously. The treatment of sewage, garbage, and feces must be fundamentally solved in conjunction with urban planning. In particular, greater attention should be paid to the protection of the chemical industry and radioactive materials, as well as the guidance of health work in newly built factories and mines. Hospital work should continue to be reformed in order to be more convenient for the people, improve the quality of medical care, and eliminate errors and accidents.

3.  Vigorously train health cadres who are both red and expert. Medical colleges at all levels must continue to implement the Party's medical education policy, vigorously grasp county-run health schools and spare-time education. It is required that 40% of the counties should run secondary health schools. Large hospitals, scientific research institutions, and medical institutions of factories and mines should all run spare-time health schools and full-time or part-time schools. Key schools should actively create conditions to set up teaching and research groups or majors in cutting-edge science and vigorously train teachers. In order to strengthen childcare work, it is necessary to vigorously train and improve existing childcare personnel and run childcare nurse schools, and actively train professional talents with both childcare and health knowledge.

4.  Launch a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, develop communist cooperation, and develop medical science research work at a high speed. This year, the country will form a strong medical science network, grasp the key points, grasp the cutting edge, and actively move towards the peak of medical science. In particular, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and accelerate the creation of China's new school of medicine. Western medicine learning Chinese medicine is the key to inheriting and developing the heritage of Chinese medicine. More people should be organized to carry out in-depth systematic learning. The medical colleges, large hospitals, and scientific research institutions across the country should divide the work and cooperate actively to conduct research on the sorting out of the motherland's medicine.

5.  Develop the production of drugs and equipment to further meet the needs. In recent years, although the production of drugs and equipment has greatly increased, due to the vigorous development of the health cause and the continuous growth of the people's needs, the production of drugs, equipment and medical equipment must be greatly strengthened. Our direction is: what foreign countries can produce, we must produce; we must not only surpass foreign countries, but also create new varieties; we must not only have a sufficient quantity, but also ensure quality. In addition to continuing to do a good job in production, not only should we resolutely overcome the phenomenon of out-of-stock in Chinese medicinal materials, but the quality should also be more excellent.

The health work in 1960 is still leaping forward continuously with the leap forward in production. We have full confidence and determination to complete this arduous and glorious task. In the process of work, we may encounter some difficulties, and new situations will constantly raise many new issues. However, the Chinese people are new people of the Mao Zedong era. Under the leadership of the Party, they are good at creating conditions and overcoming difficulties. As long as we guarantee and continuously strengthen the Party's absolute leadership, adhere to the principle of combining the Party's core members, health professionals, and the broad masses, adhere to putting politics in command, implement the general line of socialist construction, unite and cooperate between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, launch mass movements on a large scale, engage in technical revolution and cultural revolution on a large scale, and implement a series of two-pronged policies, no difficulty can stop us from moving forward, and we will inevitably be able to complete this task successfully. In the face of this great situation, health personnel at all levels must muster even greater energy, actively and bravely plunge into the battle, stand at the forefront of the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, constantly summarize experience, and kindly help and guide the masses to improve the effect of eliminating pests and diseases. More importantly, health personnel at all levels must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's writings, combine them with their own ideological reality and work reality, repeatedly ponder and master their spiritual essence, and implement them in our actions. Mao Zedong Thought is a new development of Marxism-Leninism and is the source of all our victories. As long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, implement the spirit of continuous revolution, and have both soaring energy and scientific analysis, we can confidently say that we will appear in the world as a nation with a sound physique, vigorous energy, strong vitality, and a high degree of culture.

Currently, the movement of advanced workers is being further carried out on the medical and health front, and learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward has become a hot trend. A large number of advanced collectives and advanced workers have emerged. All our health and medical personnel must be full of confidence and cheer up, and strive to achieve greater achievements in 1960 and realize the great goal of transforming customs and transforming the world.

    一年来卫生工作的成就
    1959年是我国社会主义建设继续全面大跃进的一年。我国的卫生工作，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会的决议，坚持政治挂帅，实行了党的骨干、卫生专业人员和广大群众相结合，大搞群众运动，紧紧结合工农业生产大跃进和人民公社的健全发展，在1958年大跃进的基础上阔步前进，取得了连续大跃进的大胜利。
    一年来，除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的群众卫生运动，从发展生产出发，紧密结合生产，为生产服务、协调和配合各个方面，突击与经常相结合，技术与群众相结合，轰轰烈烈，踏踏实实，一浪赶一浪，步步提高，规模更加壮阔，工作更加深入和细致。现在，四害和疾病已显著减少，城乡卫生的面貌大为改观，讲卫生、爱清洁，已逐渐成为新的社会风尚，从而大大提高了人民的健康，有力的保证并促进了工农业生产的发展和工作学习的进步。通过实践，人们越来越认识到：不卫生是耻辱，是旧社会遗留给我们的恶习；讲卫生是光荣，有利于生产、有利于工作、有利于学习、有利于改造我国人民低弱的体质，使身体健康，环境清洁，与生产大跃进、文化和技术大革命互相结合起来，对于移风易俗，改造世界有极为重大而深远的意义。在各地已经出现了许多卫生模范单位。比如大家所共知的山西稷山县和广东佛山市就是许多大面积卫生先进地区中的两面红旗。稷山县在旧社会由于三座大山的压榨，人民过着“糠菜半年粮”的生活，疫疠蔓延，人畜病亡，土地荒芜，杂草丛生，“穷村”、“脏村”、“瘟疫村”遍布全县。现在全县卫生面貌大大改变，过去经常流行的对人民威胁最大的天花、疟疾、回归热、斑疹伤寒等已经绝迹了，数以万计的慢性病人都得到了有效的治疗，爱清洁、讲卫生的风气已经形成，人人精力充沛，劳动出勤率增加，生产步步高涨，即使1959年该县遭受了四十年来未有的大旱灾，在人民的冲天干劲下，粮食生产依然比1958年的特大跃进增长了32％，被评为山西省小麦丰产模范县。广东省佛山市在解放前是以肮脏出名的，人们形容佛山的时候，总喜欢用几“多”，即：个体手工业多，“九曲十八湾”的小街小巷多，渗井臭沟多，垃圾瓦堆多，蚊子苍蝇多，疫病流行多，求神拜佛多。从这些“多”里，我们就可以知道当时佛山劳动人民的生活状况、精神面貌是极为凄惨的。今天不同了，这个城市已经由小手工业城市逐渐走上现代化的城市，由破烂肮脏的城市变为整洁美丽的城市，由封建迷信的城市变为富有民族传统的文化艺术、高尚文明的城市了。到这里来参观的人，无不称赞这里的卫生工作，无不称赞佛山整个面貌改变之神速巨大。这里的人民在党的领导下，结合生产，结合市政建设，一鼓作气，将全市一千三百多条大街小巷都进行了翻修改建，在四十八天内将一条长达八千四百一十五米的臭水沟变成了清水河、鱼塘和风景区；在一个月内改建了全市厕所、建成了数百个街头小花园，霎时间一座古城就变成青春城。集体和个人爱清洁、讲卫生的风习养成了，城内街道，基本上都可以做到每天三扫一洗。这里的人民说：“不洗街像不洗脸一样，心里不舒服”。他们推广了“五不”：不随地吐痰，不随地丢果皮废物，不随地堆放杂物，不随地倒污水、垃圾，不随地大小便、丢烟头。实行了“卫生餐”公筷制。他们把这些引以为荣，把不讲卫生看作是耻辱。由于疾病大大减少，人人精神焕发，因而劳动出勤率显著提高，生产不断跃进。全国各省市和自治区，像稷山和佛山这样的卫生红旗地区还有很多。这些地区为除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病树立了良好的榜样，并取得了丰富的经验，大大鼓舞了广大人民的斗志和进一步搞好卫生的信心和决心。
    关于消灭疾病，在全国所取得的成绩，也是很巨大的。在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，中西结合，土洋并举，采用各种综合疗法，一年间共治疗血吸虫病、丝虫病、钩虫病、疟疾患者达七千余万人，绝大多数都已痊愈。如加上过去几年所治疗的人数，共治疗血吸虫病患者五百二十余万人，丝虫病患者六百一十余万人，钩虫病患者九千一百二十余万人，疟疾患者三千一百五十余万人。这几种危害人民健康最严重的疾病，现在正在急剧缩小和加速消灭中。对各种急性、慢性传染病和地方病已找到了许多新的防治办法，提高了治疗效果，发病率和死亡率已大为降低。特别是对于肺结核、大骨节病、砂眼的治疗，已有一套新的中西综合疗法，疗效十分显著。大量的病人得到治愈，发病率显著下降，这就有力地保护了人民健康，支援了生产建设。
    由于技术革命和技术革新的蓬勃发展，劳动条件的日益改善，作业环境更加符合安全卫生的要求，职业病和多发病已大为降低。全国大部分矿山和有粉尘的工厂，都已使粉尘浓度降低到国家规定的标准以下，厂矿中暑人数一年比一年减少，钢铁系统已基本消灭了重症中暑。铅中毒和苯中毒已显著下降，并且正在取得一套完整的防治办法。这就大大鼓舞了工人的劳动热情，显著地提高了劳动生产率。
    随着社会主义建设事业在各个方面的持续跃进，我国的卫生保健组织也有了极大发展。到1959年底，卫生事业机构已发展到三十九万个，正规病床五十七万张，较之1957年都增长了90％以上。为了适应生产需要和便利病人，还建立了简易病床七十六万张。现在绝大多数人民公社都有了医院，生产大队普遍有卫生所（站），队队设有不脱产或半脱产的保健员、助产员、保育员等；另外在三百一十多万个托儿所（站）中，也都有了经过初步训练的保健员。以公社为中心的医疗保健网已经形成。在集体生产中，劳动保护大大加强了，对妇女劳动普遍贯彻了“三调三不调”：经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远。公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业，也加强了卫生管理，在卫生保健组织的大发展的同时，卫生队伍也迅速扩大起来。除过几百万半脱产、不脱产的初级卫生人员外，专业卫生技术人员较之1957年增加约三分之一，达到了一百四十六万人。
    继整风反右斗争之后，贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，在各级卫生保健组织机构中，确立和加强了党的领导，使我们的一切工作得到了根本保证。因而，我国卫生事业的伟大成就，不只是表现在数量上的大发展，更重要的是大大提高了卫生工作的质量。各级卫生人员的精神面貌有了极大的改变，社会主义积极性增强了，集体主义精神和共产主义风格迅速成长起来。在医院工作中，坚决贯彻了“勤俭办医院”和“扩大预防，以医院为中心指导地方和工矿的预防工作”的方针，广泛推行了三班门诊制，加强了预防工作，全心全意为病人服务，千方百计提高医疗质量，已成为群众性的运动，挽救了大量过去认为无法救治的濒于死亡边缘的病人。毛泽东时代的新人新事，成千累万地涌现着，有的为了减轻病人注射的痛苦，先在自己身上反复试验；有的几日几夜守护病人，不眠不休；有的为病人献出了自己的血液和皮肤；有的为了救死扶伤而贡献了自己的生命。甘肃省的红色青年医生李贡同志就是具有这样高度的革命责任感和舍己为人的高尚品质的典范。他在甘南藏族自治州工作的五年间，哪里发生病人，他就到那里去，什么时候需要，他就什么时候到来。服务没有条件，既不要报酬，也不要感谢。他为了抢救严重烧伤的藏族妇女，从自己的腿上割下了四块皮肤；为了抢救十几个患伤寒的藏族同胞，不顾自己伤寒病后的虚弱，毅然输出了自己的鲜血。李贡同志就是这样用自己的血和肉密切了党和藏族人民的联系，被藏族人民到处称颂是“毛主席派来的好医生”。李贡同志这种共产主义的高贵品质，是我们千万个先进卫生工作者的集中代表，是一部极为丰富而生动的共产主义教材。至于卫生人员深入车间、矿场、田间、工地治病防病，早已成为普遍和经常的风气，极大地鼓舞了干部和群众的生产热情。他们颂扬说：“过去医生在医院，现在医生下田间，看了病来又宣传，割麦拉耧都能干。真是党的领导好，毛主席的恩情说不完。”
    在医学教育方面：坚决贯彻执行了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”和“普及与提高相结合”的方针下，采取了中西医药并举，高、专、中、初级医校并举，正规教育与业余教育并举，全日制和半日制并举等一系列两条腿走路的方针，坚持了三个“三结合”，即：医学教育和生产劳动、和群众卫生运动、和祖国医学三结合；在党的领导下，领导干部、教师、学生三结合；教学工作、科学研究工作和医疗预防工作三结合，形成了一个医学教育大革命的新局面，并且正在日益深刻地发展着，新型的又红又专的医药卫生人才正在迅速增加，到1959年底，全国高中级医药院校（包括中医学院）已达八百余所，在校学生达二十四万余人（包括中医学院学生五千余人）与1957年比较，学校增长了三倍左右，学生增加了一倍左右，另外，还有大量业余卫生学校、干部进修学院，各种训练班和师傅带徒弟等，今年初仅在高等医药院校进行业余学习的人数，已达二万余名。这就为我们卫生事业的发展和提高，提供了重要的条件。
    继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，加强中西医团结合作，创造我国独特的新医药学派，是卫生工作中一项重大的任务。一年来由于坚决走群众路线，既反对无视祖国医学宝库的民族虚无主义思想，又反对故步自封的保守思想，使专业机构与广大群众相结合，边学习边提高，理论结合实践，研究结合临床，这一工作已经进入了一个新的阶段。中西医团结合作，不仅在防治疾病中提高了疗效，解决了许多过去他们单方面难以解决的问题，而且在科学研究工作中也获得了新的成就，创造了良好开端。如对肿瘤、白血病、再生障碍性贫血等疑难病症的治疗，对高血压的病因、病理、发病机制以及预防治疗的研究，慢性肾炎、乙型脑炎、阑尾炎等病治疗规律的研究，经络本质和针灸作用机制的研究等，都获得了新的进展，有的已经得到显著的成果。所有这些事实，更加证明党的中医政策是极为正确的。现在各地组织的西医离职学习中医班，已达三十七个，学员二千三百余人，很多著名的西医专家都在主动积极地学习祖国医学。可以肯定，只要我们紧紧遵循着党的教导，中西医进一步团结合作，埋头苦干，攻克尖端医学堡垒，创造新医药学派，在不太久的将来就会完全变成现实。
    在除害灭病运动中，医学科学研究工作也如火如荼地发展起来。由于认真贯彻了党的科学研究为生产服务和采取“两条腿走路”的方针，中西医结合，专家与群众结合，大兴大协作之风，大搞群众性科学活动，因而科学研究工作遍地开花，无论数量上或质量上，无论是在临床治疗、预防医学与尖端科学方面都获得了新的成就，一年间共完成国家的重点研究项目五千余个。放射性同位素的应用已逐步开展，心脏手术和大量血管移植术已达到国际水平，我国制造的人工心肺机已胜利的运用于临床，大面积烧伤治愈率达70.2％，超过了国际水平。除害灭病的经验和土方土法的研究，已初步总结和掌握了一套行之有效的防治办法，并已上升为理论。曹依秀、马万太的捕鼠经验等经过总结都有了很大提高。对血吸虫病治疗由二十日疗法缩短为三日疗法，不但为迅速消灭血吸虫病创造了良好的条件，而且创立了新的“顿挫法”的理论观点。此外，在全国范围内进行了广泛的药品植物普查、营养调查、高血压普查和肿瘤普查等，不仅为进一步防治疾病提供了科学依据和重要资料，并且通过这些普查总结了群众经验，及时解决了许多防治疾病中的实际问题。这些科学研究工作的发展，已经为攀登医学科学的高峰开辟了广阔的道路。
    药品器械和疫苗血清是防治疾病的重要工具。为了适应人民的需要，在大力发展数量的同时，积极提高了质量。过去有些抗菌素我们没有，现在有了；过去我们不能生产考的松、降压药，现在均能自制生产了；某些精密仪器过去我们不会制造，现在会造制了，而且都能大量生产供应，不但价格低廉，而且质量也好。中药材的生产，自国务院指示下达后，也迅速地发展了起来，既继承和发扬了祖国传统的好经验、好办法，又创造了许多先进技术和丰产方法，过去许多仅靠野生野养供应的，现在也能家种家养解决了，通过引种试养，并且还改进了许多优良品种。除采集和收购野生数量有了大量增长外，栽种面积比1957年增长将近四倍，供应比1957年多了一倍半，有些过去供应不足的品种，现在已经基本上满足了需要。
    卫生工作要前进再前进
    我国的卫生工作之所以能够取得这样巨大的成就，空前高速度的向前发展，最根本的是由于党中央和毛主席对人民的健康和生活一贯给予了极大的重视和关怀，集中了全国人民最大的愿望和最迫切的要求，将马列主义的普遍真理和我国具体实践相结合，为人民的卫生工作制定了一系列正确的方针政策，给我们指出了一条正确的道路。全国人民沿着毛主席所指示的道路，在党的领导下，自己起来同自己的文盲、迷信和不卫生习惯作斗争，贯彻实行不断革命的精神，一个运动接着一个运动，以一天等于二十年速度，迅速改变了我国卫生的面貌。现在我国人民高举着毛泽东思想的旗帜，在总路线的光辉照耀下，正昂首阔步，为高速度发展社会主义建设持续跃进，农业、工业、交通运输业、基本建设、文化教育、科学研究各个战线上，都以无比宏伟的姿态向前奔驰。全国规模的技术革新和技术革命运动也已经汇为洪流，汹涌澎湃，气势冲天。在这样的大好形势下，我们的卫生工作，必须紧紧赶上来，前进，再前进。我们全体医药卫生工作者必须要树雄心、立大志，插牢红旗，听党的话，坚决贯彻执行党的指示，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，忠心耿耿，全心全意为大跃进、为人民公社、为社会主义建设服务。1960年我国卫生工作的基本任务是：更好地贯彻执行党的总路线，根据发展国民经济以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，紧密配合生产大力支援农业，继续开展以除四害、讲卫生，消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，带动和积极发展提高农村的、城市的、厂矿的各项卫生工作，力争大大提前完成全国农业发展纲要中规定的除害灭病任务，更好地保护人民健康、保证社会主义建设的持续跃进。
    一、除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病是我国整个卫生工作的中心。必须在党委的统一领导下，全民动员，人人动手，充分调动群众的智慧和力量，配合生产，更广泛、更深入地进一步开展下去。二、三年内做出更显著的成绩。为此，必须进一步用革命精神把群众领导起来，大张旗鼓，大造声势，采用各种形式，大作宣传，讲卫生是光荣，不讲卫生是耻辱，做到家喻户晓，以移风易俗，改造世界的伟大气概，以不断革命的精神，大搞爱国卫生运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命，使老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教师、学生、男子、女子，人人都动作起来，立即掀起赶稷山、超稷山，赶佛山、超佛山规模空前的竞赛大浪潮，展开比、学、赶、帮的大运动，使先进更先进、使后进成先进，上游一争再争，速度一高再高，质量一好再好。个个打先锋，人人做模范，手执蝇拍和其他工具，彻底除掉老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子四害及其他害虫，南方地区同时要消灭钉螺，北方有的地区要消灭野鼠和旱獭。争取创造更多的四无专区、四无县市，同时，还必须坚持开展体育运动，做好工间操，打太极拳，锻炼体魄，造成社会的新风尚。
    消灭疾病南方应以血吸虫病等寄生虫病为重点，北方应以消灭地方病为重点，带动防治其他危害当地人民最严重的疾病。除四害、消灭疾病必须继续贯彻中西医药结合、土洋并举、科学技术与群众结合、治标与治本结合、突击与经常结合的原则，反复斗争，顽强作战。我们一定在最近几年内消灭危害人民最严重的疾病。
    二、大力支援农业生产，进一步做好农村人民公社医药卫生工作。各级卫生机构，必须紧紧跟上农业生产发展的需要，有计划有组织地抽派干部和卫生专业技术人员下乡上山，继续发扬医务人员深入田间工地与农民同吃同住同劳动的优良传统作风，帮助办好县医院、公社医院，帮助开办训练班，培养卫生干部。大力协助作好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作，做到有病治病，无病防病。同时还必须结合生产加强粪便管理工作，这是消灭血吸虫病、钩虫病、蛔虫病、蛲虫病、螩虫病等寄生虫病的一个根本措施。应当总结经验，搞出一套办法来。
    城市工矿企业的卫生工作，必须大大加强，认真做好职业病、多发病的防治和劳动保护工作。对污水、垃圾、粪便的处理，要结合城市规划加以根本解决，特别是对化学工业、放射性物质的防护工作，以及新建厂矿卫生工作的指导，应给以更大的注意。医院工作还要继续进行改革，以求更便利于人民，提高医疗质量，消灭差错事故。
    三、大力培养又红又专的卫生干部。各级医药院校要继续贯彻党的医学教育方针，大抓县办卫生学校和业余教育。要求40％的县都办起中等卫生学校来，大医院、科学研究机构、厂矿企业的医疗机构，都要举办业余卫生学校和全日制或半日制的学校。重点学校应积极创造条件，设置尖端科学的教研组或专业，大力培养师资。为了加强保育工作，要大力培养提高现有保育人员和举办保育护士学校，积极培养兼有保育和卫生知识的专业人才。
    四、大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，展开共产主义大协作，高速度地发展医学科学研究工作。今年全国要组成一个强大的医药科学网，要抓住重点，抓尖端，积极迈向医药科学的高峰。特别是要进一步加强中西医团结，加速创造我国的新医药学派。西医学习中医是继承发扬祖国医学遗产的关键，要组织更多的人深入的进行系统学习。对祖国医学的整理研究工作，全国医学院校、大医院、科学研究机构要分工合作，积极进行。
    五、发展药品器材的生产，进一步满足需要。几年来，药品器械的生产虽然有了大量的增加，但由于卫生事业的蓬勃发展，人民的需要不断增长，因此药品器械医疗设备的生产还必须大力加强。我们的方向是：外国能生产的，我们必须生产；不仅要超过外国的，更要创造新的品种；不仅要有足够的数量，而且一定要保证质量。对于中药材除继续搞好生产外，不仅要坚决克服脱销的现象，而且要品质更为优良。
    1960年的卫生工作，仍然是跟着生产的跃进而持续跃进的。我们完全有信心和决心来完成这一繁重艰巨而光荣的任务。在工作进行中可能会遇到一些困难，新的情况也会不断提出许多新的问题。但我国人民是毛泽东时代的新型的人，在党的领导下，是善于创造条件和克服困难的。只要保证和不断加强党的绝对领导，坚持贯彻党的骨干、卫生专业人员和广大群众相结合的原则，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻社会主义建设总路线，中西医团结合作，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和文化革命，实行一系列两条腿走路的方针，任何困难也不能阻止我们前进，我们必然能够胜利的完成这一任务。在这个大好形势面前，各级卫生人员都必须鼓足更大的干劲，积极的勇敢的投入到战斗中，站在以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动的最前列，不断总结经验，亲切帮助和指导群众提高除害灭病的效果。更重要的是各级卫生人员，都必须认真学习毛主席著作，联系自己的思想实际和工作实际，反复深思熟虑，掌握其精神实质，贯彻到我们的行动中。毛泽东思想是马列主义的新发展，是我们取得一切胜利的源泉。只要用毛泽东思想把我们的头脑武装起来，贯彻不断革命的精神，既有冲天干劲，又有科学分析，我们就可以信心百倍地这样说，我们将以一个体魄健全，精力旺盛，具有强大生命力，具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。
    当前，在医药卫生战线上正在进一步开展先进工作者运动，学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进已成热潮。先进集体和先进工作者大批涌现了出来，我们一切卫生医药人员都要信心百倍的振作起来，为在1960年取得更大的成就，为实现移风易俗，改造世界的伟大目标而努力奋斗。
