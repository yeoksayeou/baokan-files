Xinhua News Agency, Hodeidah, 9th -- Yemeni Minister of Public Works, Qadir, praised the friendly cooperation between China and Yemen in the Yemeni highway construction project when he met with Xinhua reporters in Hodeidah today.

Qadir said that Chinese experts cooperated very well with Yemeni workers in the Hodeidah-Sana highway construction project. He said that this friendly cooperation shows the development of friendly relations between the Yemeni government and the Chinese government.

When talking about the important role of this highway, Qadir said that the Hodeidah-Sana highway will connect the coastal areas and mountainous areas of Yemen. Because this highway will connect Hodeidah Port with other regions of Yemen, it will promote the development of domestic and foreign trade in Yemen.

Xinhua News Agency, Hodeidah, 9th -- The temporary highway between Hodeidah and Sana, constructed by the Yemeni government with the help of Chinese experts, has been opened to traffic. Many cars have already traveled on this highway.

This temporary highway passes through the Haraz mountain area, and most of it follows the previous route of the Hodeidah-Sana highway. However, it is more than ninety kilometers shorter than the old Hodeidah-Sana highway, which greatly facilitates transportation in this mountainous area. Chinese experts and Yemeni workers are continuing to actively construct the roadbed of the highway, and half of the earthwork has been completed. The most difficult ten miles of earthwork have been completed. The technical problems of constructing the roadbed in the desert have been solved. Chinese experts and Yemeni workers are preparing to lay asphalt pavement, and most of the required asphalt has been transported to Yemen.

    也门公共工程大臣卡迪尔说
    中也两国友好关系日益发展
    在我国专家帮助下也门一临时公路通车
    新华社荷台达9日电　也门公共工程大臣卡迪尔今天在荷台达接见新华社记者时赞扬了中国和也门在也门公路修建工程中的友好合作。
    卡迪尔说，中国专家在荷台达—萨那公路修建工程中同也门职工合作得很好。他说，这种友好合作表明了也门政府和中国政府之间的友好关系有了发展。
    卡迪尔在谈到这条公路的重要作用时说，荷台达—萨那公路将把也门沿海地区和山区联系起来。由于这条公路将把荷台达港同也门其它地区联系起来，从而将促进也门国内贸易和对外贸易的发展。
    新华社荷台达9日电　也门政府在中国专家帮助下施工的荷台达—萨那之间的临时公路已经通车。许多汽车已在这条公路上行驶。
    这条临时公路通过哈拉兹高山地区，大部分是沿着荷台达—萨那公路从前的线路开出来的。然而比老荷台达—萨那公路缩短九十多公里，它大大地便利了这个高山地区的交通。中国专家和也门工人正在继续积极地修建公路的路床工程，土方已经完成了一半。土方工程方面最困难的十英里已经完成。在沙漠中修建路床的技术问题已经解决。中国专家和也门工人正在准备铺设柏油路面，所需要的大部分沥青已运到也门。
