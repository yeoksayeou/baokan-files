I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. I think that each of us, after listening to these reports, should be inspired by the great strides our country is making on the road to socialism, should cheer for the great achievements our country has made in all aspects of socialist construction, and should be proud of the even greater and more glorious tasks ahead of us, and thus will certainly devote ourselves to the ranks of national construction with even greater vigor and courage.

We see that after the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, our 1960 National Economic Plan is another reliable plan for continued leap forward. In 1960, China's total industrial and agricultural output value will reach 298 billion yuan, an increase of 23% compared to 1959, which is more than twice the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. Moreover, with the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production, we will also have great developments in transportation, commerce, science, culture, education, and other aspects. Such a scale of construction and speed of development has never been seen in the history of any capitalist country. But we can completely achieve it and over fulfill it through our efforts. In the past two years, the great victories of the continuous Great Leap Forward achieved by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party have powerfully proved that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three magic weapons of our country's socialist construction period, are the products of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the combination of the reality of the Chinese revolution and construction, and they have been firmly supported by the broad masses of the people and have become an infinite material force. This is the most fundamental guarantee for the high-speed and sustained leap forward of our country's socialist construction. Moreover, after the two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, we have accumulated more valuable experience in building socialism, have a much stronger material and technical foundation than in the past, and have an increasingly high morale and revolutionary enthusiasm. Especially since the beginning of this year, a vigorous and large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being carried out throughout the country. From cities to the countryside, from small and medium-sized enterprises to modern factories, the tide of technical innovation is boiling everywhere. In order to continue to develop the national economy at high speed, the broad masses of working people resolutely responded to the Party's call, set lofty aspirations, aimed high, and strived for the top, concentrating their soaring enthusiasm for building socialism into technical innovation and technical revolution. Combining soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with technical innovation, combining the spirit of hard work and the style of practical work with clever methods, constantly innovating production technology, and fully utilizing the potential power of people and materials. On all production fronts, our production technology level is constantly improving. The production in the first quarter of many places and many industrial and mining enterprises has greatly exceeded the level of the fourth quarter of last year, and the plans for the first quarter have been overfulfilled, resulting in an all-round red situation. In the vast countryside, the healthy development of the People's Commune is increasingly showing its unparalleled superiority and strong vitality. 500 million peasants, with the cooperation and support from all sides, are striving with the greatest enthusiasm to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture. In cities across the country, a movement to vigorously establish urban people's communes, vigorously establish street industries, vigorously establish public canteens and public welfare undertakings, and extensively organize people's economic life is being fully launched, further organizing the urban labor force better, liberating housewives from housework, and vigorously engaging in production and construction. All these new factors provide more favorable conditions for us to realize the 1960 National Economic Plan.

We firmly believe that in our country, with the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the three deeply rooted magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, with the infinite wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of 650 million people and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, our National Economic Plan will undoubtedly be overfulfilled; our country will surely be able to continue to leap forward; although imperialism and all domestic and foreign reactionaries will clamor and even conspire to sabotage out of fear, all their evil deeds cannot stop our progress. The Chinese people must build their country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern defense, and a strong China will surely stand tall in the world like a giant.

Here, as a member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I am glad to see that with the development of the national economic situation, many people in the industrial and commercial circles, under the leadership of the Party, have successively invested in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to varying degrees, and many family members of industrialists and businessmen have also successively participated in street production and social welfare undertakings. We believe that with the spirit of the National Congress jointly convened by the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce recently, especially the in-depth dissemination and implementation of the Party's instruction that industrialists and businessmen should "take care of one end" and "lean to one side" in the cause of socialist revolution and construction, more industrialists and businessmen and their families will better devote themselves to the vigorous movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and invest in the movement of vigorously establishing urban people's communes and vigorously organizing people's economic life. Countless vivid examples teach us that the reason why the working masses can make such amazing achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution is that their motivation lies in taking Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, being of one heart with the Party, and wholeheartedly serving socialist construction. We believe that only by wholeheartedly throwing ourselves into the torrent of revolutionary mass movements, especially participating in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and working, working, sharing joys and sorrows with the working people, can we truly experience the soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the working people, can we be educated by the communist style of the working people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, leave difficulties to themselves, and give convenience to others, can we gradually change our own thoughts and feelings and living habits, and become one with the working people, can we make comparisons between the exploiters and the working people, recognize our own shortcomings, and further recognize the necessity of accepting socialist transformation, and only then can we truly combine political and ideological transformation with labor practice, can we truly learn from the working people, and can we mobilize all positive factors under the leadership and help of the working people, contribute our strength, and gradually achieve wholeheartedly serving socialism, and make more and more contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and construction. While actively participating in production and labor practice, our industrialists and businessmen and their families should also actively participate in various political studies, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, connect with reality, improve their consciousness, and constantly break the bourgeois stand, viewpoints, and methods. It is necessary to improve political awareness and ideological understanding through various studies, including political theory, current affairs and policies, and historical materialism, to recognize the laws of social development, correctly understand and analyze things, gradually establish the thought and attitude of wholeheartedly serving socialism, gradually establish the proletarian world outlook, and better serve and better transform ourselves in participating in the country's socialist construction work.

Now, after listening to the various reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, we feel even more deeply that the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system is becoming clearer and clearer in our country's construction cause. For our industrial and commercial circles, it is another profound education. This further proves that, whether from the perspective of the entire country or from the perspective of any individual, only by unswervingly following the socialist road under the leadership of the Party can there be a bright future. Our industrialists and businessmen and their families are also sons and daughters of the great motherland, and they have deep patriotic feelings. In our country today, to be patriotic must be to love socialism. For each of us, the socialist cause of the motherland has our share of responsibility and also our share of glory. We must rely more closely on the leadership of the Party, follow the direction of "taking care of one end" and "leaning to one side" indicated by the Party, improve our consciousness in the situation of the rapid development of the socialist cause of the motherland, muster our energy, better serve, better transform ourselves, form an upsurge in the industrial and commercial circles to actively serve socialism and strengthen self-education and self-transformation, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely strive to complete and over fulfill the 1960 National Economic Plan, strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and strive to achieve the continuous leap forward of our country's national economy throughout the 1960s.

    工商业者要更好地改造自己
    陈叔通副委员长在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告。我想，我们每一个人听了这些报告，都要为我们国家在社会主义道路上前进的巨大步伐所鼓舞，都要为我们国家在社会主义建设各方面所取得的伟大成就而欢呼，都要为我们今后更为伟大、光荣的任务而骄傲，从而一定会更加干劲冲天、勇气百倍地投入祖国建设的行列。
    我们看到，经过了1958年和1959年两年连续的大跃进，我们1960年的国民经济计划又是一个可靠地继续跃进的计划。在1960年里，我国工农业总产值将达到二千九百八十亿元，比1959年增长23％，比第一个五年计划期间平均增长速度快一倍以上。而且，随着工农业生产的迅速增长，我们在交通运输、商业、科学、文化、教育等各方面，也将有很大的发展。像这样的建设规模和发展速度，是任何资本主义国家历史上所从来没有过的。而我们却是通过努力完全可以做到而且可以超额完成的。在过去两年中，我们全国人民在党的领导下所取得的连续大跃进的伟大胜利，就有力地证明了总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命和建设实际相结合的毛泽东思想的产物，它们已经为广大人民群众所坚决拥护，成为无穷无尽的物质力量，这就是我国社会主义建设可以高速度持续跃进最根本的保证。而且，经过了1958年和1959年两年的大跃进，我们在建设社会主义方面已经积累了更多宝贵的经验，有着比过去雄厚得多的物质技术基础，有着越来越高涨的坚强信心和革命干劲。特别是今年以来，一个气势磅礴、规模宏大的，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正在全国范围内开展起来。从城市到农村，从中小型企业到现代化工厂，到处沸腾着技术革新的浪潮。为了继续高速度发展国民经济，广大的劳动人民坚决响应党的号召，树雄心，立大志，争上游，攀高峰，把高涨的建设社会主义的积极性集中到技术革新和技术革命中来。把冲天的革命干劲同技术革新结合起来，把苦干的精神、实干的作风同巧干的方法结合起来，不断地革新生产技术，充分发挥人和物的潜在力量。在各个生产战线上，我们的生产技术水平正在不断地提高，许多地方和许多工矿企业第一季度的生产，已经大大地超过了去年第四季度的水平，超额完成了第一季度的计划，出现了满堂红的局面。在广大的农村中，人民公社的健康发展，越来越显露出它的无比优越性和强大的生命力，五亿农民正在各方面的配合、支援下，以最大的热情力争农业更好更全面的跃进。在全国城市中，一个大办城市人民公社，大办街道工业，大办公共食堂和公共福利事业，广泛地组织人民经济生活的运动正在全面展开，进一步把城市劳动力更好地组织起来，把家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，大力从事生产建设事业。所有这些新的因素，更为我们实现1960年国民经济计划提供了有利的条件。
    我们坚决相信，在我们国家里，有着党和毛主席的英明正确的领导，有着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个深入人心的法宝，有着六亿五千万人民的无穷智慧和冲天干劲，有着苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助，我们的国民经济计划将无疑地一定会超额完成；我们国家一定能够不断的跃进；尽管帝国主义和一切国内外反动派会因害怕而叫嚣甚至阴谋破坏，但是，他们的一切罪恶行为丝毫也不能阻止我们的前进。我国人民一定要把自己的国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化、现代国防的伟大的社会主义国家，一个强大的中国将一定会像巨人般屹立于世界。
    在这里，我作为一个全国工商业联合会的成员，高兴地看到，随着国家经济形势的发展，目前工商界在党的领导下，已经有不少人在不同程度上先后投入了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，不少工商业者的家属，也先后参加了街道生产和社会福利事业。我们相信，随着最近民建会、工商联两会联合召开的全国代表大会的精神，特别是党的工商业者要在社会主义革命和建设事业中“顾一头”、“一边倒”的指示的深入传达和贯彻，将会有更多的工商业者和工商业者的家属，更好地投入轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的运动中来，投入到大办城市人民公社、大力组织人民经济生活的运动中来。无数生动的事例教育我们，工人群众所以能够在技术革新和技术革命方面做出这样惊人的成绩，他们的动力在于以毛泽东思想为指导，同党一条心，全心全意为社会主义建设服务。我们认为，我们工商业者和工商业者的家属只有一心一意地投身到革命群众运动的洪流中来，特别是参加到技术革新和技术革命的运动中去，和劳动人民一起同劳动，同工作，同甘苦，才能够切身体会到劳动人民的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，才能够受到劳动人民敢想、敢说、敢做，把困难留给自己、把方便送给别人的共产主义风格的教育，才能够逐步改变自己的思想感情和生活习惯，和劳动人民打成一片，才能够在剥削者和劳动者之间有所比较，认识到自己的短处，从而进一步认识到接受社会主义改造的必要，也才是真正把政治思想改造和劳动实践结合起来，才是真正向劳动人民学习，才能够在劳动人民的带动、帮助下，把一切积极因素都调动起来，贡献出我们的力量，逐步做到一心一意为社会主义服务，在社会主义革命和建设事业中作出越来越多的贡献。在积极参加生产、劳动实践的同时，我们工商业者和工商业者的家属，还应当积极参加各项政治学习，认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，联系实际，提高自觉，不断地破资产阶级立场、观点和方法。要通过各项学习包括政治理论、时事政策、历史唯物主义等学习，提高政治觉悟和思想认识，来认清社会发展规律，正确地认识和分析事物，逐步树立全心全意为社会主义服务的思想、态度，逐步建立无产阶级的世界观，在参加国家的社会主义建设的工作中更好地服务，更好地改造。
    现在，我们听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的各项报告，更加感觉到社会主义制度的无比优越性，正在我们国家建设事业中越来越清楚的显示出来。对我们工商界来说，又是一次深切地教育。这就进一步证明了，无论从整个国家来说或者从任何个人来说，只有坚定不移地在党的领导下，走社会主义的道路，才会有光明的前途。我们工商业者和工商业者的家属，也是伟大祖国的儿女，都有着爱国主义的深切感情，在今天我们的国家里，爱国就一定要热爱社会主义。对于我们每一个人来说，祖国的社会主义事业有我们一份的责任，也有我们一份的光荣。我们一定要更加紧密地依靠党的领导，遵循着党所指示的“顾一头”、“一边倒”的方向，在祖国社会主义事业一日千里的发展形势下，提高自觉，鼓足干劲，更好地服务，更好地改造，在工商界中形成一个积极为社会主义服务、加强自我教育和自我改造的热潮，和全国人民一道，坚决为争取完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗，为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗，为实现我国国民经济在整个六十年代里持续不断的跃进而奋斗。
