Studying Theory Also Requires Lofty Aspirations
Su Qunwen

Comrade Dong Renqin, Party Branch Secretary of the Sixteenth Brigade of Tangjia People's Commune in Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, is a pacesetter in learning. Born into a poor peasant family and with only a junior primary school education, Dong Renqin has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works for five years, applying the theory he has learned to guide his practical work. Under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, their production brigade has shed its label as a poor team and caught up with the level of the local wealthy teams.

Why is Comrade Dong Renqin able to study theory so well? Because he has a correct purpose for studying theory. He says that when he sees the many changes in life after liberation, he often thinks:

“Why is the Communist Party so good? Why is Chairman Mao so wise? How do we build socialism and communism? At this time, it becomes urgent to understand these revolutionary principles. … In my work, I often encounter difficulties, and sometimes I even make mistakes. I often consider: What is the reason for this? Where is the problem? How can I do my work better and improve production?” With such a clear purpose, Comrade Dong Renqin has a correct direction, great determination, and strong perseverance to study theory well. He overcame the numerous difficulties of time and educational level and seriously, systematically, and comprehensively studied Chairman Mao's works. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he felt: "My thinking has become much more open, my eyes are brighter, my enthusiasm is greater, and I have learned more and more methods, and the more I learn, the more enjoyable it becomes."

Comrade Dong Renqin's example tells us that theory is not something unattainable. As long as we set lofty aspirations, our grassroots cadres and workers and peasants can study theory, master theory, and apply theory.

Today, some comrades, when it comes to learning, emphasize difficulties and are unwilling to learn, saying: "Now I am busy with work and have no way to study." Of course, in doing revolution, building the country, and making the Great Leap Forward, where is it not busy? Who is not busy? And when will it not be busy? According to this logic, we will never learn theory in our entire lives. However, Comrade Dong Renqin and many other people are studying very well. Aren't they busy? No, they are not only equally busy people, but also the busiest because they have studied well and have the guidance of theory. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, everyone is busy with work, but we are busy for the revolution and construction, busy for building socialism and communism, and we will always be busy. Precisely because we are so busy, we cannot do without the guidance of theory at any time. If we do not strive to study theory well, we will not be able to adapt to the needs of revolution and construction. We must study Chairman Mao's works well and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work. Chairman Mao once said: "In Marxism, theory is important, and its importance is fully manifested in a sentence said by Lenin: 'Without revolutionary theory, there will be no revolutionary movement.' … Because it can guide action." (On Practice) If we want to do our work well, we must study theory well. The better we learn and the more proficiently we use it, the better we can "busy" our work.

Can we study when we are busy with work? Comrade Dong Renqin's example tells us: We can. There are difficulties in everything. The question is not whether there are difficulties, but how to deal with difficulties: Are we afraid of difficulties and move forward in overcoming them, or are we afraid of difficulties and retreat when we know they exist? Comrade Dong Renqin said well: "In front of a Communist Party member, there are no insurmountable difficulties!"

As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it," "A person without ambition is not worth being human, and a person with ambition will succeed." This statement is very thought-provoking. Whether one has ambition or not, whether one is determined or not, plays a decisive role in the success or failure of things and the size of achievements. Because things always have to be done by people, and if the people who do things are neither determined nor ambitious, how can they achieve anything? In doing anything, we must have determination and ambition, and not just small ambition, but lofty ambition. Studying theory is no exception. We are doing the great cause of socialism and communism, so how can the small difficulties in learning be mentioned!

The vast number of cadres and workers and peasants in our country have long had a good atmosphere for studying theory, and now their enthusiasm for learning is even higher, and a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works is being launched. Mao Zedong Thought is forever the guarantee of our country's revolution and construction. In order to master the theoretical weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and build our motherland better, we must set lofty aspirations early, study Chairman Mao's works diligently with unparalleled perseverance and fearless spirit, and learn and apply them simultaneously. Let us once again review Chairman Mao's words: "We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn what we do not understand. … Delve into it, for a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and we can always learn it."

    学理论也要有雄心壮志
    苏群文
    江苏海门县汤家人民公社十六大队党支部书记董仁亲同志，是一个学习上的尖兵。贫农出身，先前只有高小文化程度的董仁亲，坚持学习毛主席的著作，五年如一日，运用学到的理论，指导自己的实际工作，使他们的生产大队，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，摘掉穷队的帽子，赶上当地富队的水平。
    董仁亲同志为什么能学好理论？因为他有一个学好理论的正确目的。他说，当他看到解放后生活的许多变化时，常常这样想：
  “共产党为什么这样好？毛主席为啥这样英明？怎样建设社会主义、共产主义？这时候，就迫切需要懂得这些革命道理。……工作中经常碰到困难，有时候还出了毛病，我就经常考虑：这是什么原因，问题出在哪里？怎样可以把工作做得更好，把生产搞得更好？”有了这样明确的目的，董仁亲同志就有了学好理论的正确方向，巨大决心和坚强毅力。他克服了时间和文化程度上的重重困难，而认真地系统地全面地学习了毛主席著作。学了毛主席著作，他觉得：“思想开通多了，眼睛更明亮了，干劲愈来愈大，办法愈学愈多，越学越有味道。”
    董仁亲同志的事例告诉我们：理论并不是高不可攀的事情，只要立下雄心壮志，我们的基层干部和工农群众，都可以学习理论、掌握理论，运用理论。
    今天，有些同志一讲到学习，便强调困难，不愿学习，说什么：“现在工作忙，没办法学习。”当然，干革命，搞建设，闹大跃进，哪里不忙？谁个不忙？又有何时可以不忙？按这种逻辑，我们一辈子也学不成理论了。然而，董仁亲同志和许许多多的人却是学习得很好。难道他们不忙吗？不，他们不仅同样是忙人，而且由于学习得好，有了理论的指导，因而还是忙得最好的人。在大跃进的年代，大家工作都忙，可是我们是为革命和建设而忙，是为建设社会主义、共产主义而忙，我们将永远忙下去。正因为是这样的忙，我们任何时候都离不开理论的指导。不努力学好理论，就不能适应革命和建设的需要。我们一定要学好毛主席的著作，以毛泽东思想来指导我们的工作。毛主席曾经说：“在马克思主义看来，理论是重要的，它的重要性充分地表现在列宁说过的一句话：‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。’……因为它能够指导行动。”（实践论）我们要做好工作，就必须学好理论，学得越好，用得越熟练，就越能把工作“忙”得好。
    工作忙能不能学习？董仁亲同志的事例告诉我们：完全能。凡事都有困难。问题不在有没有困难，而在于如何对待困难：是不怕困难、破难而进，还是害怕困难、知难而退？董仁亲同志说得好：“在共产党员面前，没有克服不了的困难！”
    俗语说：“世上无难事，只怕有心人”，“无志者枉为人，有志者事竟成”。这话很发人深思。有志还是无志，有心还是无心，对于事情的成败，对于成就的大小，起着决定的作用。因为事情总要人去办，办事情的人既无心又无志，哪能得到什么成就？我们办任何事情，都要有决心有志气，并且不是微心小志，而是要有雄心壮志，学理论当然不能例外。我们干的是社会主义、共产主义的大事，区区学习上的微小困难岂能在话下！
    我国广大的干部和工农群众，早就有学习理论的风气，现在他们的学习热情更加高涨，一个学习毛主席著作的新高潮正在掀起。毛泽东思想，永远是我国革命和建设事业的保证。为了掌握毛泽东思想这个理论武器，更好地建设祖国，我们要早立雄心壮志，以无比的毅力，用无畏的精神，认真学习毛主席的著作，勤学苦练，边学边用。让我们再一次温习一下毛主席这样的话吧：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。……钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”
