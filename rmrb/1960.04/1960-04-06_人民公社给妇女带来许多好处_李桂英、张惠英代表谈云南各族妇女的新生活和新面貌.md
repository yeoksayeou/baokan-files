The broad masses of women sing like this: "In the past, women managed the small family, seven things to worry about after opening the door. Turning around the pot and mill, with a baby on their back; wanting to go to the fields for production, their heart is at home while their body is in the fields. Now, housework is socialized, and thousands of families are laughing. Eating in the public canteen, sending children to the nursery, concentrating on production without worries, not afraid of the setting sun after work, the whole family is happy when returning from labor, learning culture without hurry. Studying and working are all good, becoming a model that everyone praises."

Fellow representatives:

We fully agree with the work reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee, and will resolutely implement them in our future work.

Women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, like women all over the country, under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the General Line, have achieved continuous great leaps forward in production. The people's communes increasingly demonstrate their unparalleled superiority, bringing many benefits to women.

Laboring women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have always been diligent and hardworking. In many areas, laboring women are not only good at managing the household, but also good at agricultural production. However, in the old society, laboring women had no social status and their lives were miserable. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after a series of revolutionary movements, they broke away from the oppression and shackles of the old society and gained liberation. The realization of people's communes has further enabled women to embark on the road of complete liberation. With the further transformation of the ownership of the means of production, with the comprehensive development of large-scale collective production, a comprehensive leap forward, women have undergone tremendous changes in production labor, social activities, ideological awareness, and so on. The broad masses of women not only universally participated in collective labor, but also greatly exerted their wisdom and strength, and widely launched various socialist emulation campaigns such as "Red Daughters," "Clever Girls," "Red Flag Sisters-in-Law," "Ten Thousand Golden Flowers," and "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds in Full Bloom," further breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, creating many advanced experiences, and a large number of advanced figures and advanced collectives emerged. Together with the broad masses of men and women, they promoted the over-fulfillment of production targets and played a positive role in building socialism at high speed.

Women's participation in social labor and political and cultural learning has broadened their minds, made them feel happy, and changed their mental outlook.

People's communes organize large-scale collective production, which requires the establishment of corresponding large-scale collective life. Over the past two years, collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries have been comprehensively consolidated and developed, freeing a large number of women from scattered, individual, and tedious housework to participate in social labor and political and cultural learning. Children receive collective education. Women's minds are broadened, their moods are cheerful, their mental outlook is changed, and collectivist thinking is greatly increased. Especially after the socialist education movement centered on the two roads, socialist and communist consciousness has been greatly improved. Many women have changed from only caring about small families, being short-sighted, and narrow-minded to caring about the collective and the country, loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving the people's communes, and developing the communist style of leaving difficulties to themselves and giving convenience to others.

Experience has proven that only by holding high the three magic weapons and further consolidating and developing the people's commune system can our women and men jointly create a happy life. During a period in the summer of last year, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists vigorously spread rumors saying that "people's communes were established too early, too quickly, and too badly." No! They are completely lying with their eyes open. In fact, the superiority of people's communes is endless and cannot be obliterated. From the profound changes that have taken place in women in all aspects since the communization of people's communes, it also shows the unparalleled superior role of the people's commune system. The example of Yongxin Management District of Penglai People's Commune in our Yiliang County vividly proves this point. The women of the management district all said in unison: "The superiority of the people's commune is really great. This time, women will be completely liberated!" This is a truth summed up from personal experience.

When our management district was not established as a people's commune, the scale of the cooperatives was small, and it was impossible to fully utilize women's labor. In addition, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, it was impossible to establish a large number of collective living welfare undertakings. Therefore, many women had to spend a lot of time and energy turning around the pot and taking care of children, and could not often participate in production. Some women who were burdened by heavy housework participated in production even less. Among the 831 households and 1,789 women in the entire management district, there were 728 laborers, but only more than 550 participated in production, and more than 100 other women did not participate or rarely participated in production at all. After the establishment of the people's commune, due to its large size and high degree of public ownership, there were many people and great strength, and it was able to engage in large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction and develop diversified operations such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, which opened up broad avenues for women to participate in collective labor. According to the needs of the work and the characteristics of women, the women's labor force is rationally arranged to give full play to women's role. In particular, the development of tool reform has provided more favorable conditions for women to widely participate in collective labor. In the past, labor that relied on shoulder carrying, such as transporting fertilizer and earthwork, was difficult for women to participate in and the efficiency was not high. After the establishment of the commune, after the entire management district increased by more than 120 ox carts, small horse carts, chicken carts, and wheelbarrows last year, women used carts to participate in transporting fertilizer and earthwork, which was not only not difficult, but also greatly improved efficiency. Now, women participate in a total of 19 agricultural and sideline production items in the management district. In addition to the 100% participation of 728 women laborers in production, many old and young people with some labor ability have also participated in light labor that they can handle. Now, more than 900 people often participate in production, an increase of about 80% compared to before the communization. A large number of women have become the main force on our management district's production front. Last year, women dug more than 700 mu of fields and transformed more than 200 mu of fields. Women also undertake tasks such as plowing fields and leveling seedling fields. Other tasks such as field management, pig raising, and fertilizer accumulation are also mostly undertaken by women. In water conservancy construction, women also accounted for 40% of the total labor force.

People's communes organized collective life, fundamentally solving the contradiction between women's participation in labor and taking care of housework.

People's communes are not only organizers of collective production, but also organizers of collective life, thus fundamentally solving the contradiction between women's participation in labor and taking care of housework, and making profound changes in family relations. For example, in the 831 households in Yongxin Management District, in the past, an average of one woman per household was at home cooking and taking care of children. After the establishment of public canteens, 62 cooks replaced more than 830 people in cooking, liberating the labor force of more than 700 women, allowing them to fully invest in agricultural production. Now, the public canteens have also realized steam cooking, self-flowing water, mechanized vegetable cutting, and self-flowing vegetable irrigation, saving more than 20 laborers. The entire management district has established four nurseries and four kindergartens, allowing the mothers of more than 430 children to actively engage in production with peace of mind. 社员李玉英's family has five members and three children. In the past, Li Yuying had to cook, feed pigs, find pig food, and wash children's clothes every morning. Her husband had to find firewood. There were several days in a month when they could not participate in production. Although they were strong laborers in their twenties, they only earned more than 4,000 work points in 1957, and life was very difficult. Therefore, they often quarreled and fought. They would quarrel if the rice was not cooked, if the children cried, and if the pigs knocked over the pots. After the establishment of the commune, the children entered nurseries and kindergartens, and meals were available in public canteens. Last year, Li Yuying alone earned more than 3,100 work points in a year (plus her husband's, a total of more than 7,000 work points). The couple also received 16 or 17 yuan in wages every month, and they did not have to worry about oil, salt, firewood, rice, and children's burdens, improving their lives, and the couple was very harmonious. There are many such cases, and some couples have even launched competitions in production. 社员史凤珍 and her husband were not strong laborers and had a small child. In 1957, they were chronically overdrawn households, earning only more than 3,100 work points each year. Last year, the child entered the nursery and they earned more than 4,700 work points, paying off their loans. 史凤珍 happily said: "Look, the child is growing up white and fat in the nursery, with a hammer hitting a nest on the mattress, eating three meals a day, and wearing clean clothes. They are better cared for than at home. We must work hard in production to be worthy of the Party and Chairman Mao."

Since liberation, although women can also participate in various social political activities and scientific, cultural, and technical studies, due to busy housework, the actual opportunities to participate are less than those of men. Now, because they are freed from trivial housework, women have more opportunities to participate in various social political activities and cultural and technical studies. The management district has established a technical committee. Over the past year, many women have learned about rice cultivation and the use of new-style walking plows, threshing machines, sprayers, and other new-style agricultural tools, as well as chemical fertilizer application techniques, and have carried out cultural learning. In 1957, only 30% of the women in the entire management district understood rice cultivation techniques such as close planting, frequent weeding, and fertilizer application. Now, the number has increased to 70%. Twenty-seven women have learned to plow fields, and twenty-four have learned to do carpentry. 30% of the families in the entire management district have become "cultural families," and most of the work point recorders in each team are women. After participating in production labor and social activities, women's mental outlook has undergone profound changes, and their ideological awareness and labor attendance rate have been significantly improved. A large number of activists have emerged. Truly, pacesetters line up and red flags become forests. In 1959, 361 women in the entire management district were rewarded, 475 women were commended, and three were awarded the title of March 8th Red Banner Bearer and rewards by the All-China Women's Federation, greatly boosting women's political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm. When recalling and comparing the situation before and after the communization of people's communes, the broad masses of women sang like this: "In the past, women managed the small family, seven things to worry about after opening the door. Turning around the pot and mill, with a baby on their back; wanting to go to the fields for production, their heart is at home while their body is in the fields. Now, housework is socialized, and thousands of families are laughing. Eating in the public canteen, sending children to the nursery, concentrating on production without worries, not afraid of the setting sun after work, the whole family is happy when returning from labor, learning culture without hurry. Studying and working are all good, becoming a model that everyone praises." This vividly and specifically illustrates the new living conditions and mental outlook of the broad masses of women after the communization of people's communes.

With the consolidation and development of people's communes, and with the gradual realization of large-scale collective agricultural production mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification, gradually reducing labor intensity will be more conducive to women engaging in various production labors, and women will further exert their wisdom and strength in agricultural production.

In the future, our women must be more united under the leadership of the Party, hold high the three magic weapons, and strive to achieve a continued great leap forward in 1960.

    人民公社给妇女带来许多好处
    李桂英、张惠英代表谈云南各族妇女的新生活和新面貌
    广大妇女这样歌唱：“过去妇女当小家，开门七事乱如麻。锅前磨后团团转，背上背个小娃娃；有心下田去生产，人在田里心在家。如今家务社会化，千家万户笑哈哈。公共食堂去吃饭，托儿所里送娃娃，一心生产无牵挂，收工不怕日西斜，劳动回来全家乐，不慌不忙学文化。学习劳动样样好，当了模范人人夸。”各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理，李先念副总理和常务委员会的工作报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我们云南各民族妇女也和全国妇女一样，在党的领导下，和总路线光辉照耀下，生产连续大跃进，人民公社愈来愈显示了无比的优越性，给妇女们带来许多的好处。
    云南各民族劳动妇女，素来是勤俭的，爱劳动的，在许多地区，劳动妇女不仅是持家的能手，而且是农业生产的能手。但在旧社会里，劳动妇女是没有社会地位的，生活是悲惨的。解放以后，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过一系列的革命运动，摆脱了旧社会的压迫和束缚，获得了翻身。而人民公社化的实现，更使妇女走上了彻底解放的道路。随着生产资料所有制的进一步变革，随着大规模集体生产的全面发展，全面跃进，妇女在生产劳动、社会活动、思想意识等等方面都发生了巨大的变化。广大妇女不仅普遍参加了集体劳动，而且大大发挥了智慧与力量，广泛开展了“红色女儿”，“巧姑娘”，“红旗嫂”，“万朵金花”，“万紫千红大开花”等各种各样的比学赶帮的社会主义竞赛运动，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，创造了不少的先进经验，和涌现了大批的先进人物和先进集体。她们和广大的男女群众一起，促进了生产指标的超额完成，对高速度地建设社会主义，发挥了积极的作用。
    妇女参加了社会劳动和政治文化学习，思想开阔了，心情舒畅了，精神面貌改变了。
    人民公社组织大规模的集体生产，要求相适应的建立大规模的集体生活。两年来，公共食堂，托儿所等集体生活福利事业得到了全面巩固和发展，使大批妇女从分散的，个体的繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，参加了社会劳动，参加了政治，文化学习。儿童受到了集体的教育。妇女的思想开阔了，心情舒畅了，精神面貌改变了，集体主义思想大增长。特别是经过了以两条道路为中心的社会主义教育运动以后，社会主义共产主义觉悟大大提高。许多妇女从过去只关心小家庭，眼光短浅，心胸狭窄，变成为关心集体和国家，热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱人民公社，发扬了把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的共产主义风格。
    经验证明：只有高举三大法宝，进一步巩固和发展人民公社制度，我们妇女才能和男子一道共同创造幸福的生活。去年夏季的一段时期，有一小撮右倾机会主义分子曾大肆造谣说“人民公社办早了，办快了，办糟了”。不！他们完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。事实上人民公社的优越性是说不完的，也是抹杀不了的。单从人民公社化后妇女在各方面所发生的深刻变化来看，也显示了人民公社制度的无比优越作用。我们宜良县的蓬莱人民公社永新管理区的例子，就活生生地证明了这一点。管理区的妇女都异口同声地说：“人民公社的优越性硬是大，这回妇女要彻底翻身了！”这是从切身经验中总结出来的一条真理。
    我们管理区未成立人民公社时，由于合作社的规模较小，还不可能充分使用妇女的劳动力。再加上受到人力物力的限制，不可能大量举办集体生活福利事业。因此，许多妇女不得不花大量的时间和精力在锅边转和带孩子，不能经常参加生产，一些家务拖累重的妇女，参加生产的时间就更少。全管理区八百三十一户，一千七百八十九个妇女中，有七百二十八个劳动力，但只有五百五十多个参加生产，其余一百多个妇女根本不参加或很少参加生产。人民公社成立后，由于一大二公，人多力量大，能够从事大规模的农田水利基本建设，开展农林牧副渔等多种经营，这就为妇女参加集体劳动开辟了广阔的道路。根据活计的需要和妇女的特点，合理地安排妇女劳动力，充分发挥妇女的作用。特别工具改革的开展，为妇女广泛参加集体劳动提供了更为有利的条件。过去靠肩挑手拿的劳动，如运肥、运土方等，妇女参加有困难，工效不高。公社成立后，去年全管理区增加了一百二十多张牛车、小马车、鸡公车和独轮车以后，妇女用车子参加运肥，运土方等劳动，不仅没有困难，而且工效大大提高。现在妇女共参加了管理区的十九项农副业生产，除七百二十八个妇女劳动力百分之百的参加生产外，许多老的，小的，有一点劳动能力的，都纷纷参加了力所能任的轻微劳动。现在经常参加生产的，达九百多人，比公社化以前约增加了80％。大批妇女已经成了我们管理区生产战线上的生力军。去年妇女挖田七百多亩，改田二百多亩。妇女还担任犁田，整秧田等任务。其他如田间管理、养猪、积肥等工作，也大都由妇女担任。在兴修水利中，妇女也占了总劳动力的40％。
    人民公社组织了集体生活，从根本上解决了妇女参加劳动和料理家务的矛盾。
    人民公社不仅是集体生产的组织者，也是集体生活的组织者，因此从根本上解决了妇女参加劳动和料理家务的矛盾，使家庭关系也发生了深刻的变化。如永新管理区八百三十一户人家，过去平均每户有一个妇女在家煮饭和带小孩，建立公共食堂后，六十二个炊事员就代替了八百三十多个人煮饭，解放了七百多个妇女的劳动力，使她们完全投入了农业生产。现在各公共食堂又实现了煮饭蒸气化，用水自流化，切菜机械化，蔬菜灌溉自流化，节省了二十多个劳动力。全管理区举办了四个托儿所，四个幼儿园，使四百三十多个儿童的母亲安心地积极投入了生产。社员李玉英一家五口人三个娃娃，过去每天早上李玉英要煮饭、喂猪、找猪菜、洗娃娃衣裳，她丈夫要去找烧柴，一个月有好几天不能参加生产。两人虽说是二十多岁的强劳动力，但在1957年只做了四千多个工分，生活很困难。因此经常吵嘴闹架，饭不熟要吵，娃娃哭要吵，猪把罐罐弄翻了也要吵，公社成立后，娃娃进了托儿所、幼儿园，吃饭有公共食堂。去年李玉英一人一年就做了三千一百多个工分（加上丈夫的共七千多分），两口子月月还领十六、七元工资，不愁油盐柴米和娃娃拖累，改善了生活，两口子很和睦。像这样的事很多，有的夫妻间还在生产上开展了竞赛。社员史凤珍夫妻两人劳动力不强，有个小娃娃，1957年是个老超支户，每年只做三千一百来个工分，去年娃娃进了托儿所，做了四千七百多个工分，还清了贷款。史凤珍高兴的说：“瞧瞧娃娃在托儿所长得白白胖胖，垫的一锤打个窝，吃的是三顿，穿的干干净净，比在家还养得好，硬是要好好搞生产才对得起党和毛主席”。
    解放以来，虽说妇女同样可以参加各种社会政治活动和科学文化、技术学习，但是由于家务事繁忙，实际参加的机会比男子要少。现在由于摆脱了琐碎的家务劳动，就使妇女有更多的机会参加各种社会政治活动和文化技术学习。管理区成立了技术委员会。一年多来许多妇女学习了有关稻谷栽培和新式步犁、打谷机、喷雾器等新式农具，化学肥料的使用技术，并开展了文化学习。1957年全管理区妇女中只有30％的人懂得密植、勤锄、压肥等水稻栽培技术，现在增加到了70％，妇女学会犁田的有二十七人，学会做木工的有二十四人；全管理区有30％的人家成了“文化人家”，各队的记分员绝大部分是妇女担任。妇女们在参加了生产劳动和社会活动后，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，思想觉悟和劳动出勤率都有了显著的提高，涌现了大批的积极分子。真是标兵成列红旗成林，1959年全管理区有三百六十一个妇女受到了奖励，四百七十五个妇女受到了表扬，三个受到了全国妇联给的三八红旗手的称号和奖励。大大地鼓舞了妇女的政治积极性和劳动积极性。广大妇女在回忆对比人民公社化前后的情况时，这样歌唱着：“过去妇女当小家，开门七事乱如麻。锅前磨后团团转，背上背个小娃娃；有心下田去生产，人在田里心在家。如今家务社会化，千家万户笑哈哈。公共食堂去吃饭，托儿所里送娃娃，一心生产无牵挂，收工不怕日西斜，劳动回来全家乐，不慌不忙学文化。学习劳动样样好，当了模范人人夸”。十分生动具体地说明了人民公社化以后广大妇女的崭新的生活状况和精神面貌。
    随着人民公社的巩固和发展，随着大规模的集体农业生产机械化，半机械化和电气化的逐步实现，逐渐减轻劳动强度，将更加有利于妇女从事各种生产劳动，妇女在农业生产上将进一步发挥智慧与力量。
    今后我们妇女要更加团结在党的领导下，高举三大法宝，为实现1960年继续大跃进而奋斗。
