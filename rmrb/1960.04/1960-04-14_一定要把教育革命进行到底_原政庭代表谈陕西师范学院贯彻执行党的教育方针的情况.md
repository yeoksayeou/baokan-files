Comrades,

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft Budget for 1960," and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will resolutely implement them in my future work.

I am a staff member of a higher education institution in Shaanxi Province. Now, I would like to share some personal experiences and opinions on thoroughly implementing the Party's education policy and striving for the complete victory of the education revolution.

Implementing the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and ensuring the Party's leadership over education, and carrying out the education revolution, is an important component of the socialist revolution, with profound historical significance. Over the past year or so, our Shaanxi Normal College, like other fraternal institutions across the country, under the leadership of the Party Committee, and on the basis of the great victory of the 1957 Rectification Campaign, mobilized the masses to conscientiously implement this policy and launched a great education revolution, achieving significant results. The main achievements are: further strengthening and consolidating the Party's absolute leadership over the work of the college, establishing the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in the academic field and teaching work; initially overcoming the bourgeois tendencies of teaching being divorced from politics, production, and reality, and beginning to realize the basic principles of socialist and communist education of combining politics with professional work, education with labor, and theory with practice; establishing a new teaching order with teaching as the main focus, combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, and forming a new type of teacher-student relationship under the leadership of the Party, characterized by mutual learning and democratic equality. This has greatly changed the mental outlook of all teachers and students, and significantly improved the quality of education. However, we cannot be complacent with this; we must further deepen the struggle of the education revolution to achieve a comprehensive and complete victory. From the practice of the past year or so, I have deeply realized that in order to accomplish this task and achieve this goal, in the current situation, we must focus on the following two aspects of work:

First, under the leadership of the Party, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to mobilize the masses, carry out the struggle between the two roads and the two viewpoints on the education front, and strengthen the transformation of the world outlook of the old intellectuals. Education is part of the superstructure. Since human beings entered class society, the education of a certain society has always served a certain class and a certain politics. The education of old China for thousands of years, no matter how different they were in form or how they changed, their essence was to serve the then exploiting classes and the then politics. A common feature of them was the separation of education from productive labor, using the spirit of despising manual labor and manual laborers, and using one-sided knowledge to educate the educated. Today, our country is a socialist country, a country where the working class leads and the working people are the masters of the country. To make education serve proletarian politics, to combine education with productive labor, to cultivate the educated into "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," and to gradually and ultimately eliminate the difference between manual and mental labor, will inevitably be resisted by the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, and this resistance cannot be completely overcome in a short period of time. Schools are places where intellectuals are concentrated. Among these intellectuals, many come from exploiting class families and are deeply influenced by bourgeois education. Although they have made significant progress under the education of the Party in the past few years since liberation, in terms of world outlook, many still belong to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. Of course, the majority of them are willing to transform their world outlook well under the leadership of the Party and conscientiously implement the Party's policies; but there are always some people who attempt to use the bourgeois world outlook to transform school education and oppose the Party's education policy. Therefore, in the initial stage of the education revolution, some people insisted on the path of focusing only on professional skills and neglecting political awareness, opposing political activities in schools, saying that "politics and professional work are contradictory, and engaging in political activities will affect teaching work." Some people opposed the combination of education and productive labor, saying that "if the biology department is combined with productive labor, it will become an agricultural college and will destroy the systematic nature of biological science," saying that "mathematics is an abstract theory, and if it is linked to reality, it will lower its status," and so on. When we proposed to establish a new teaching order in schools with teaching as the main focus, combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, some people shouted loudly, saying that "there is too much labor, too few class hours," and "the quality of education has declined," and so on. When their clamor was shattered by iron facts (the quality of education did not decline but improved), they then one-sidedly emphasized that productive labor must be combined with teaching, and therefore advocated doing more labor on campus and less or no off-campus labor in rural areas and factories and public welfare labor, and even attempted to count classroom experiments and general investigations and research that are neither productive nor physical labor as productive labor; when we proposed that implementing Mao Zedong Thought in all disciplines and tasks is the core and key to the entire school work, some people emphasized the particularity of the discipline they were in charge of, saying that Chairman Mao "has no writings on this discipline, so it is impossible to implement it," and some people even said that "natural science itself is dialectical materialism, and as long as certain relevant principles are explained clearly, it is equivalent to implementing Mao Zedong Thought," and so on. As for those who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, distort and castrate the Party's education policy, and spread the revisionist view of the extinction of class struggle, they are still not isolated cases in today's schools. All of the above fallacies and erroneous views are, in the final analysis, reflections of the bourgeois world outlook in education work. They are all the bourgeoisie's stubborn resistance and attack on the Party's education policy. If we fail to expose and resolutely criticize these fallacies and reactionary views in time and allow them to spread freely, then our education will inevitably return to the old road of the bourgeoisie. However, the facts of the past year or so have proved that the reason why we have been able to break through numerous difficulties and achieve brilliant achievements one victory after another on the education front is precisely because we have adhered to putting politics in command under the leadership of the Party, fully mobilized the masses, and continuously carried out the struggle between the two roads and the two viewpoints, and precisely because we have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize bourgeois educational thought, academic viewpoints, and various forms of revisionist viewpoints. Moreover, the facts have proved that the more widely and deeply a certain department carries out this struggle, the better our education policy is implemented in this department, and the faster and more significantly the quality of education improves; conversely, if a certain department does not pay enough attention to this struggle and does not carry it out vigorously, our education policy will not be implemented well in this department, and the quality of education will improve slowly or not at all. Therefore, I believe that holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out the struggle between the two roads and the two viewpoints in depth, and continuing to strengthen the transformation of the world outlook of intellectuals is the fundamental guarantee for achieving the complete victory of the education revolution.

Second, under the leadership of the Party, we must continue to mobilize the masses, adopt the method of combining teachers and students, and, in accordance with the Party's education policy and the spirit of the general line for socialist construction, vigorously carry out the reform of teaching content. Education is one of the powerful tools for transforming the old society and building a new society. However, whether it can serve our socialist revolution and socialist construction, in addition to the decisive role of the world outlook and professional level of educators, the quality of the teaching content itself also plays a significant role. Because the proletarian educational thought and academic viewpoints and the bourgeois educational thought and academic viewpoints are finally concentrated in the teaching content, therefore, ensuring the socialist orientation and the highest and latest scientific level of the teaching content is a work that we must absolutely not neglect in implementing the Party's education policy and completing the great task of the education revolution. Over the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party Committee, our school has also adopted the method of combining teachers and students, with Marxism-Leninism as the command, and the combination of theory and practice as the principle, to carry out the work of textbook construction for some major disciplines in various departments, and has achieved certain results. However, due to the short time, this work has not been carried out meticulously and deeply enough. Therefore, in the recent mass teaching inspection, we found that there are still many problems in the content of various disciplines. The main problems are: (1) The content of some courses is outdated and poor, seriously divorced from politics, production, and reality. In the liberal arts, they are generally divorced from the current political struggle. Literary theory courses treat Chairman Mao's literary thought only as knowledge to be imparted to students, without linking it to the current struggle between the two roads on the literary and artistic front; literary courses, in order to maintain the "system," do not distinguish between the primary and secondary, do not ask about the political direction when selecting materials, and only arrange seats for writers, and every era must be talked about. In the science courses, the textbooks used by various courses are generally taught according to the scientific system established by the original bourgeois scholars, divorced from the needs of the current socialist construction. Many courses in the mathematics department rarely talk about the cutting-edge mathematics used in current production, only emphasizing the "abstractness, theoretical nature, and systematic rigor" of mathematics. The chemistry department only makes preliminary and rough introductions to knowledge related to polymer chemistry and radiochemistry. The courses in the biology department cannot make good expositions on our country's "Agricultural Development Program" (draft) and the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production. Students summarized the content of economic geography courses as three more and two less, that is, more numbers, more clauses, and more repetitions, while fewer Party policies and less reliability, and summarized the content of psychology as fourizations and one lack, that is, abstraction, conceptualization, verbalization, and physiologicalization, and lack class viewpoints when talking about the formation of children's character. (2) The content of some courses not only overlaps with the content of middle school textbooks, but also overlaps with each other, and the courses themselves also have repetitions before and after. This inevitably wastes a lot of valuable energy and time of teachers and students and reduces the teaching effect. The textbook content of the Chinese Department's literature course overlaps with middle school textbooks by about 70%, ancient Chinese overlaps with classical literature, and modern Chinese overlaps with modern literature. The formation of the earth is repeatedly discussed three or four times in the geography department's general geography, surveying, and astronomy. The question of from apes to humans must be mentioned in the history department's world history and Chinese history. As for the repetition between pedagogy and the teaching methods of various subjects, it is even more obvious and prominent. (3) The content of some courses is arranged according to the development history of the subject. Many things have been proved to be incorrect or useless with the development of social production, and can be replaced by new or advanced scientific achievements, but our textbooks still tell the process of human understanding of the objective world step by step, which guides students to take a long detour and cannot directly and quickly learn what they should learn. The above examples fully illustrate that much of the teaching content of our many courses is currently contrary to the Party's education policy, is very unable to meet the urgent needs of socialist construction, and is not in line with the spirit of the Party's general line for building socialism. If we do not resolutely and thoroughly carry out fundamental reforms of these teaching contents, break the bourgeois and establish the proletarian, eliminate the old and bring forth the new, then we will not only fail to improve the quality of education, but also have a very bad effect on students' thinking, and of course it will be impossible to train cadres who are both red and expert for the country, and it will be impossible to make our education serve our socialist construction well and truly with a high speed of continuous leap forward.

The two issues discussed above are actually only one issue, because the process of reforming teaching content is also the process of transforming the world outlook of our intellectuals, especially the old intellectuals, and is the process of arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, only by conscientiously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve a complete victory in the great education revolution!

Please criticize and correct any inappropriate or erroneous points in my speech.

Finally, I wish the conference a successful victory and all delegates good health!

    一定要把教育革命进行到底
    原政庭代表谈陕西师范学院贯彻执行党的教育方针的情况主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理“关于1959年决算和1960年预算草案的报告”和人大常委会的工作报告，并将在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我是陕西省高等学校一个工作人员。现在，我想就深入贯彻党的教育方针，争取教育革命的彻底胜利这一问题谈一些个人的体会和意见。
    贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，教育必须要由党来领导的教育工作方针，进行教育革命，是社会主义革命的一个重要组成部分，它具有极为深远的历史意义。一年多来，我们陕西师范学院也和全国其他兄弟院校一样，在党委领导下，在1957年整风运动取得巨大胜利的基础上，发动群众，认真地执行了这一方针，开展了教育大革命，也取得了很大的成绩。主要是：进一步加强和巩固了党对学校工作的绝对领导，在学术领域和教学工作中，奠定了马克思列宁主义的领导地位；初步克服了教学脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的资产阶级倾向，开始实现了政治与业务结合、教育与劳动结合、理论与实际结合的社会主义、共产主义教育的基本原则；建立了以教学为主，教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的新的教学秩序，形成了在党的领导下，教学相长、民主平等的新型师生关系。这就使全体师生的精神面貌起了很大的变化，教育质量有了显著的提高。但是，我们还不能以此自满，必须使教育革命的斗争进一步深入发展，才能获得全面、彻底的胜利。从一年多来的实践中，我深深体会到要完成这个任务，达到这个目的，在当前形势下，就必须很好地抓紧以下两个方面的工作：
    一、必须在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，继续发动群众，开展教育战线上两条道路、两种观点的斗争，加强对旧知识分子的世界观的改造。教育是上层建筑。从人类进入阶级社会以来，一定社会的教育，总是为一定的阶级、一定的政治服务的。旧中国几千年来的教育，不管它们在形式上怎样不同，怎样变动，但其实质都是为当时的剥削阶级和当时的政治服务的。它们的一个共同特点就是教育与生产劳动分离，就是用鄙视体力劳动和体力劳动者的精神，用片面的知识来教育受教育者。今天，我们的国家是社会主义的国家，是以工人阶级为领导的劳动人民当家作主的国家，要使教育为无产阶级的政治服务，要使教育与生产劳动结合，要把受教育者培养成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，并逐步而最终地消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的差别，就必然地会遭到资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子的反抗，而且这种反抗还不是一个短时期内就能够完全克服的。学校是知识分子集中的地方。在这些知识分子中，有很多人是出身于剥削阶级家庭，受资产阶级教育影响很深。解放几年来，在党的教育下，他们虽然有了显著的进步，但就世界观来说，许多人都还是属于资产阶级知识分子这个范畴的。当然这中间的多数人是愿意在党的领导下，很好地改造自己的世界观，认真贯彻党的方针政策的；但总有一些人，企图用资产阶级的世界观来改造学校教育，而反对党的教育方针。因此，在教育革命的初期阶段，有的人就坚持只专不红的道路，反对在学校搞政治活动，说什么“政治与业务是矛盾的，搞了政治活动就会影响教学工作”。有的人反对教育与生产劳动结合，说什么“生物系如果结合了生产劳动就会变成农学院，就会破坏生物科学的系统性”，说什么“数学是抽象的理论，如果联系实际，就会降低它的地位”等等；当我们提出在学校中要建立以教学为主的教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的新的教学秩序时，有的人就大喊大叫地说什么“劳动太多了，上课时数太少了，”“教育质量降低了”等等；当他们这种叫嚣为铁的事实所粉碎（教育质量不是降低而是提高了）的时候，他们就又片面地强调生产劳动必须与教学结合，因而主张多搞校内劳动少搞或不搞下乡下厂的校外劳动和公益劳动，甚至企图把课堂实验和一般性的调查研究等既非生产又非体力劳动的活动，也要算作生产劳动；当我们提出把毛泽东思想贯彻到各门学科和各项工作中去是整个学校工作的核心和关键的时候，有的人就又强调他所担任的学科的特殊性，说什么毛主席对他这门学科“没有什么论著，因而无法贯彻”，有的人还说什么“自然科学本身就是辩证唯物主义的，只要讲清某些有关原理，就等于贯彻了毛泽东思想”等等。至于披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，歪曲和阉割党的教育方针，散布阶级斗争熄灭论的修正主义观点的人，在今天的学校中，也还不是个别的。以上这些谬论和错误观点，归根结底都是资产阶级的世界观在教育工作中的反映。都是资产阶级对于党的教育方针的顽抗和进攻。如果我们对于这些谬论和反动观点不予以及时揭露和坚决批判而任其自由泛滥，那么，我们的教育就必然要回到资产阶级的老路上去。但是，一年多来的事实证明，我们在教育战线上之所以能够冲破重重困难而一个胜利接着一个胜利地取得辉煌的成就的原因，正是由于我们在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，不断地开展了两条道路、两种观点的斗争的结果，正是由于我们以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判了资产阶级的教育思想、学术观点和各种形形色色的修正主义观点的结果。而且事实证明某一个系科把这一斗争进行得越广泛，越深入，我们的教育方针就在这一个系科贯彻得越好，教育质量就提高得越快，越显著；反之，某一个系科对于这一斗争重视不够，开展不力，我们的教育方针就在这一个系科贯彻得不好，教育质量就提高得慢，甚至没有提高。因此，高举毛泽东思想的红旗深入开展两条道路、两种观点的斗争，继续加强对知识分子的世界观的改造，我以为是要取得教育革命彻底胜利的根本保证。
    二，必须在党的领导下，继续发动群众，采取师生结合的办法，根据党的教育方针和社会主义建设总路线的精神，大力开展教学内容的改革。教育是改造旧社会和建立新社会的强有力的工具之一。但是，它到底能否为我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，除了教育工作者的世界观和业务水平具有决定性的作用以外，教学内容本身的质量也起着很大的作用。因为无产阶级的教育思想与学术观点和资产阶级的教育思想与学术观点最后都集中地表现在教学内容之上，因此，保证教学内容的社会主义方向和高度的最新的科学水平，是我们贯彻党的教育方针，完成教育革命这一伟大任务所绝对不能忽视的工作。一年多来，我们学校在党委领导下，在批判资产阶级的教育思想和学术观点的基础上，也曾采用师生结合的办法，以马列主义思想为统帅，以理论与实际结合为原则，对于各系科的一些主要学科，进行了教材建设的工作，取得了一定的成绩。但是，由于时间短促，这一工作还进行得不够细致、深入，因而在最近的群众性的教学大检查中，我们发现各门学科的内容方面仍然还存在着不少的问题。主要是：（一）一些课程的内容陈腐贫乏，严重的脱离政治，脱离生产，脱离实际。文科方面一般是脱离当前的政治斗争，文艺理论课把毛主席的文艺思想只当作知识传授给学生，不与当前文艺战线上两条道路的斗争联系起来；文学课为了维护“体系”，选材时不分主次，不问政治方向，只给作家排定座位，各个时代都要讲到。理科方面各科所用教材，一般都是按照原来资产阶级学者所建立的科学体系进行讲授，脱离了当前社会主义建设的需要。数学系许多课程，很少讲到目前生产上所用的尖端数学，只是强调数学的“抽象性、理论性与系统严密性”，化学系对于有关高分子化学和放射化学的知识，也只作初步的、粗略的介绍，生物系的课程对于我国“农业发展纲要”（草案）和农业增产的“八字宪法”，还不能作很好的阐述。同学们把经济地理课的内容概括为三多二少，即数字多、条条多、重复多，而党的方针政策少，可靠性也少，把心理学的内容归纳为四化一缺，即抽象化、概念化、词句化、生理化，而在讲儿童性格的形成时则缺乏阶级观点。（二）一些课程的内容不但与中学教材重复，而且各门课程之间也多重复，各门课程本身也有前后重复之处。这就必然地浪费了师生们许多宝贵的精力和时间，降低了教学效果。中文系文学课教材与中学教材重复的达70％左右，古汉语与古典文学重复，现代汉语与现代文学重复。地球的形成问题，在地理系的普通地理、测量学、天文学中重复地讲了三、四遍，从猿到人的问题，在历史系的世界史和中国史中都要讲到。至于教育学与各科教学法之间的重复就更为明显而突出。（三）一些课程的内容是按照该门科学发展史的顺序编排的。很多东西随着社会生产的发展，已经证明是不正确或没有用的了，是可以用新的或高级的科学成就代替的了，而我们的教材则仍然是照着人类认识客观世界的过程逐次讲述，这就引导学生走了很长一段弯路而不能直接地、很快地学得所应学到的东西。以上这些事例，充分地说明了目前我们的许多课程的教学内容，有很多是与党的教育方针相违背的，是十分不能适应社会主义建设的迫切需要的，也是与党的建设社会主义的总路线的精神不相符合的。如果我们不坚决彻底地对这些教学内容进行根本改革，破资立无，除旧布新，那么，我们就不仅不能提高教育质量，而且还会对学生的思想发生很坏的作用，当然就不可能为国家培养出又红又专的干部，就不可能使我们的教育很好地、真正地为我们的社会主义建设高速度的继续跃进服务。
    以上所谈两个问题，实际上也只是一个问题，因为教学内容的改革过程，同时也就是我们知识分子特别是旧知识分子的世界观的改造过程，也就是以毛泽东思想武装我们的思想的过程。因此，只有认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，才能取得教育大革命的彻底胜利！
    我的发言如有不妥和错误之处，请批评指正。
    最后祝大会胜利成功，各位代表身体健康！
