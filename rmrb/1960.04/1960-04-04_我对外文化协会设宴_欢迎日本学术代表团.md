Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd. The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries hosted a banquet at noon today to welcome the Japanese academic delegation for the investigation of Chinese character reform, who are visiting our country.

	Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, expressed a warm welcome to the delegation's visit to our country at the banquet. In his speech, he pointed out that the Chinese people resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, but have not changed their friendly attitude towards the Japanese people in the slightest. He said that the delegation's visit to China will contribute to promoting friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people.

	Hu Yuzhi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Character Reform Committee, also spoke at the banquet, pointing out that the delegation's visit will play a positive role in the work of character reform in both China and Japan.

	Shiiki Yoshimaro, head of the Japanese academic delegation for the investigation of Chinese character reform, said, "A few days before we visited your country, we issued a statement to our friends in Tokyo who were seeing us off, expressing our firm opposition to the revised Japan-U.S. Security Treaty currently under consideration in our parliament. Due to the revision of this treaty, the Japan-U.S. military system will be strengthened and expanded in the next ten years, with its spearhead pointed at China and the Soviet Union, which we absolutely cannot allow. It is clear that this runs counter to world peace." He also severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China.

	Lin Lin and Sun Pinghua, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Chinese language and character reform experts Ji Xianlin, Ye Laishi, Lu Shuxiang, Li Jinxi, Lu Zhiwei, and others attended the banquet. Kōichi Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, was also invited to attend the banquet.

    我对外文化协会设宴
    欢迎日本学术代表团
    新华社3日讯　中国人民对外文化协会今天中午设宴欢迎前来我国访问的日本考察中国文字改革学术代表团。
    中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙在宴会上对代表团这次来我国访问表示热烈欢迎。他在讲话中指出，中国人民坚决反对岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，但是并没有丝毫改变对日本人民的友好态度。他说，代表团的这次来中国访问，对于促进中日两国人民的友好合作和文化交流将会作出贡献。
    中国文字改革委员会副主任胡愈之也在宴会上讲话，他指出，代表团的这次访问对中日两国文字改革的工作将起良好的作用。
    日本考察中国文字改革学术代表团团长士岐善麿讲话说，“我们来贵国访问的前几天，在东京向欢送我们的朋友发表了访问贵国的声明，表明了我们坚决反对正在我国国会审议中的修改了的日美安全条约。由于这个条约的修改，在今后十年内，将要加强和扩大日美军事体制，其矛头是指向中国和苏联，这是我们绝对不能允许的，很明显，这是与世界的和平背道而驰的。”他还严厉谴责了岸信介政府敌视中国的政策。
    参加宴会的有中国人民对外文化协会副秘书长林林、孙平化，以及中国语言和文字改革专家季羡林、叶籁士、吕叔湘、黎锦熙、陆志韦等。在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也应邀出席宴会。
