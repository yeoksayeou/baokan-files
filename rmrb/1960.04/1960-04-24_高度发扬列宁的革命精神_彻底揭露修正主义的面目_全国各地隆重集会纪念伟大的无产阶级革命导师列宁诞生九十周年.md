Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The Communist Party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions universally held grand rallies on the 21st and 22nd to solemnly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin.

Participating in the commemorative rallies in various locations were local leaders of the Party, government, military, and people's organizations, representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representatives of local people's congresses and members of the CPPCC committees, leaders of local organizations of various democratic parties, representatives of advanced producers and advanced workers in industry, agriculture, and various other fields, renowned professors, scientists, and writers, as well as people from other walks of life. Consuls-general and consuls of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, experts from fraternal countries who are helping China with its construction, and representatives of delegations from fraternal countries who are visiting various locations were also invited to attend the commemorative rallies.

Responsible comrades of the local Party committees gave reports at the commemorative rallies. In their reports, they elaborated in detail on the great achievements of the great Lenin in defending and developing Marxism, guiding the world's proletarian revolution, and the colonial and semi-colonial revolutionary movements. They also seriously criticized the various fallacies spread by modern revisionists, represented by Tito, on issues such as proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and on issues of war and peace. They emphasized the importance of strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, studying the works of Mao Zedong, highly developing Lenin's revolutionary spirit, thoroughly exposing the true face of modern revisionism, and continuing to consolidate and develop the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPC, delivered a report at the commemorative meeting entitled "Leninism is the Banner of Victory for the World Proletarian Revolution." He said that Lenin dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and made immeasurable contributions to the cause of liberation of the world's proletariat and working people. The basic principles of Leninism still have universal significance for the proletarian revolutionary cause in all countries today. After discussing that the Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution and analyzing the current international situation, Shu Tong emphasized that thoroughly smashing modern revisionism and thoroughly smashing the war schemes of imperialism are two serious and inseparable combat tasks at present. Strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of the international communist movement are the fundamental guarantees for the proletariat and working people of all countries to stop war, safeguard peace, and strive for national independence, people's democracy, and the victory of socialism. Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the CPC, emphasized at the commemorative meeting that modern revisionists who succumb to the pressure of imperialism distort and tamper with Leninism, and vigorously spread revisionist fallacies, with the aim of serving imperialism. In commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Lenin's birth, our task is to hold high the banner of Leninism, further strengthen the unity of the international proletariat, better study and defend Lenin's doctrine, thoroughly smash modern revisionism, and safeguard the forever victorious advance of the cause of socialism and communism.

Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC, said in his report that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and construction is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of our Party and our people, in the process of leading our country's revolution and construction, and in the process of struggling against various erroneous ideas, not only creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, but also creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. We must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, earnestly study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, further strengthen the struggle against modern revisionism, and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. Hui Yuyu, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC, explained in his report, from the three aspects of philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism, that Lenin comprehensively and creatively developed Marxism, and advanced Marxism to a new stage. He said that we believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the new world will grow year by year, and the old world will collapse year by year. Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that the Chinese Communist Party has always held high the banner of Leninism, resolutely carried out irreconcilable struggles against revisionism and opportunism, defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, thereby enabling the revolutionary cause of our people to be invincible and ever-victorious.

Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC, said in his report entitled "Educate the People with Communist Ideology" that Lenin's great life made great contributions to the world's proletarian revolution and the cause of communism. Lenin's doctrine is the guide to our actions, and Lenin's revolutionary spirit always inspires our hearts. He said that the ultimate goal of us communists is great communism, and we must stand at the height of communism to view socialism. We must learn from Lenin's example, develop the socialist revolution and construction with full proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm and the spirit of continuous revolution, resolutely fight against all remnants of capitalist forces and ideological influences, and enthusiastically praise and support the buds of communism that are beginning to grow. We should educate the masses of people with communist ideology in the process of socialist construction. In his report, Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, focused on elaborating some important principles of Lenin on proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and criticized the fallacies spread by modern revisionists, represented by Tito, such as "capitalism peacefully and spontaneously grows into socialism" and "the withering away of the state." He said that modern revisionists are doing their best to oppose the proletarian revolution, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, obliterate the class struggle after the working class seizes power, obliterate the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, and also obliterate the struggle between the two world systems on an international scale, nonsensically claiming that the proletarian state has become a supra-class "independent force" and "monopolist." The purpose of all these revisionist views is nothing more than to abolish the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Yang Shangkui pointed out that the "theory" of the withering away of the state by the Yugoslav leadership group, the traitors to the modern international communist movement, is nothing new, but was trafficked from the traitor Kautsky, and is serving a small number of exploiting classes and capitalist imperialism. Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, said at the commemorative meeting that Lenin pointed out more than forty years ago that the root of modern war lies in the imperialist system. At present, the strength of the socialist camp has surpassed that of imperialism, and it is practically possible to prevent aggressive wars launched by imperialism. However, imperialism is still imperialism after all, and imperialism is still constantly carrying out and preparing for local wars, and is constantly preparing for world wars. In order to strive for and realize true and lasting peace, we must continue to strengthen the forces defending world peace, inspire the fighting spirit of the people of the world, and carry out a resolute struggle against the aggressive policies of imperialism. Zhou Li, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, pointed out after analyzing the current favorable international situation in which the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind, that under such circumstances where the balance of power is increasingly unfavorable to the imperialist war forces, the US ruling group has been forced to make some appeasing gestures. However, as Lenin pointed out, modern war arises from imperialism, and due to the existence of the three basic contradictions of imperialism, the root of war also exists. The nature of imperialism is plunder. While advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the aggressive activities and war schemes of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States in the struggle to resolutely defend world peace, and we must follow the path of seeking peace through struggle as Lenin has guided us. Wu Jinnan, Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, in his report, used the world history of the ninety years since Lenin's birth and the current international situation to discuss the great guiding significance of Leninism to the international proletarian revolution in the past, present, and future. He emphasized that imperialism has two hands to deal with the people of the world: one is fake peace; the other is war. We must use two hands to deal with imperialism: one is to vigorously expose the conspiracies of imperialism and strive for world peace; the other is to heighten vigilance and be prepared at all times to use just wars to eliminate the unjust wars of imperialism. Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC, after elaborating the brilliance of Leninism and its great significance in guiding the world proletarian revolution, called on the broad masses of cadres in Henan Province to further earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Chairman Mao, draw great ideological strength from them, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, improve leadership methods and work styles, closely link with the broad masses of people, and better implement the Party's general line.

Li Huang, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC, said at the commemorative meeting that Lenin instructed us that opposing revisionism is a long-term task of struggle. Now the world situation has undergone tremendous development compared with the time when Lenin was alive, and a strong socialist world has been formed. Now is the time when the East wind is prevailing over the West wind, the socialist cause is getting better and better day by day, and imperialism is decaying day by day. Even under such a situation of unprecedented victory for the socialist revolution, modern revisionism has emerged again, which once again proves that Lenin's instruction that opposing revisionism is a long-term task of struggle is very brilliant. Li Huang said that modern revisionism is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, which paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism. To commemorate Lenin is to learn Lenin's revolutionary spirit and thoroughly smash modern revisionism. In his report entitled "Commemorating Lenin, Defending Marxism-Leninism," Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that in the more than forty years since the victory of the October Revolution pioneered by Lenin, the revolutionary cause of the world's proletariat and working people has achieved extremely great achievements, which is an immortal contribution of the great Lenin and his doctrine. Every one of us Marxist-Leninists should consciously stand at the forefront of the struggle and resolutely struggle against revisionism and various forms of opportunism, and strive to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to fulfill the great historical mission of the working class. In his report, Fu Zhensheng, Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that in commemorating Lenin, we must learn from Lenin's revolutionary qualities of upholding a high degree of principle and persistent struggle against all anti-Marxist and revisionist views, and learn from Lenin's high degree of vigilance against class enemies and his uncompromising fighting spirit.

Yu Yichuan, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC, said in his report that Leninism arose from the proletarian revolutionary struggle and has a distinct proletarian revolutionary characteristic. Lenin's thought shines with indelible brilliance and demonstrates strong vitality among the working people all over the world. He pointed out that under the current international situation, resolutely opposing modern revisionism is of great significance. We must organize the entire Party and the entire people to launch a movement to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, which is the most meaningful activity for us to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Lenin's birth. In his report, Du Xinyuan, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that Lenin's doctrine and Lenin's revolutionary practice throughout his life have immeasurable significance for the proletarian revolutionary cause and the progressive cause of all mankind. We must hold high the banner of Leninism, learn from Lenin's spirit of opposing the revisionism of the Second International, resolutely struggle against modern revisionism, defend Marxism-Leninism, defend the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and promote the proletarian revolutionary movement from one victory to another. Ren Baige, First Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, said that Leninism has increasingly penetrated people's hearts, and Lenin's great cause has achieved brilliant victories. The great Soviet Union has entered the period of comprehensively building communism, the socialist camp is growing stronger, the international communist movement is rising day by day, and the storm of national liberation movements has swept across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In his report, Chen Purlu, Alternate Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the CPC, pointed out that commemorating the great Lenin and learning and carrying forward Lenin's spirit of revolutionary struggle are of extremely important significance for the revolutionary and construction cause of the Chinese people and for the struggle of the working people all over the world for peace, democracy, and socialism. He said that all our victories are, in the final analysis, victories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Guo Xilan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, said in his report that Lenin attached great importance to the national question. He pointed out many times that the national question is an integral part of the entire proletarian revolution. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and in combination with China's actual conditions, have formulated a completely correct national policy. Tibet has achieved brilliant achievements in quelling the rebellion, carrying out democratic reforms, safeguarding the unity of the motherland, strengthening national unity, and vigorously developing production in the past year. This is the great victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in Tibet. He called on all cadres to adhere to Lenin's principles on the national question, implement the Party's national policy, and enable the Tibetan people to embark on the happy road of socialism together with the fraternal nationalities of the motherland.

Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, pointed out in his report entitled "Commemorating Lenin, Learning from Lenin" that now the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day, and the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing on an unprecedentedly broad scale. Imperialism is disintegrating due to the intensification of internal contradictions and contradictions between imperialists. All this shows the great victory of Leninism. Fang Zhongru said that in order to study Leninism and defend Leninism, it is necessary to thoroughly smash the attempts of modern revisionists to distort and castrate Lenin's doctrine. Chen Zenggu, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that Lenin's theory of imperialism, his theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, his theory of building socialism and communism, his theory of the peasant question, his theory of the national and colonial questions, and his doctrine of Party building are the greatest contributions to the world proletarian revolutionary cause and the victorious weapons for the people of the world to strive for liberation. He called on everyone to study Lenin's theory and doctrine well, defend Marxism-Leninism, and defend the socialist cause. Tan Shengbin, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC, delivered a report entitled "Hold High the Banner of Leninism and Advance Along the Socialist-Communist Road." He pointed out that when we enter the stage of continuous leap forward in socialist construction, the fundamental purpose of studying Leninism is to understand, grasp, and apply the objective laws of the development of things, to develop the cause of socialist construction at a high speed and proportionally, to continue to mobilize the masses, go all out, and strive to complete and over fulfill the national economic plan for 1960, to achieve a better and continuous leap forward in the last three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, and to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development two or three years ahead of schedule. Li Jinglin, Secretary of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, said that in commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Lenin's birth, we should learn from Lenin's spirit of defending Marxism, oppose revisionism, adhere to the spirit of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in Moscow, resolutely defend Marxism-Leninism, and promote the victory of the international proletarian liberation cause. Lin Bomin, Alternate Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, said that Leninism is the banner of victory for the world's proletariat and progressive mankind in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. To commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Lenin's birth, we must hold higher the banner of Marxism-Leninism, earnestly study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, learn Lenin's revolutionary fighting spirit, and better unite ourselves and strike at the enemy.

Hu Zhaoheng, Alternate Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, said that in the new era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, it is necessary to resolutely oppose any revision and distortion of Marxism-Leninism by modern revisionists represented by Tito. Hu Zhaoheng pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest crystallization of the wisdom of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and is a beacon illuminating our path forward. The victory of the Chinese revolution and construction, and the victory of the revolution and construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are all victories of the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong Thought. Shi Jiyan, Standing Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, said that we Chinese Communists and the Chinese people feel particularly close to Lenin. This is because the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, and because Lenin once gave special care to the Chinese revolution. In commemorating Lenin, we must study Leninism, adhere to and defend Leninism, and at the same time, we must combine the study of Leninism with the ongoing movement to study the works of Mao Zedong.

After the commemorative rallies in various locations ended, films about Lenin were shown, or dramas and musical programs about Lenin were performed.

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The land, sea, and air force units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been extensively carrying out various activities in recent days to solemnly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin.

The PLA headquarters and various units, organs, and academies stationed in Beijing have all held commemorative rallies separately. At a report meeting jointly held by the naval and air force leading organs on the 20th, Ai Siqi was invited to give a report. Units stationed in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, Jinan, Lanzhou, and the frontline of Fujian have also universally held commemorative meetings and report meetings.

The officers and soldiers of various units have enthusiastically launched a high tide of studying Lenin's works. A certain unit in the Beijing area organized Lenin's works study groups among the cadres to earnestly study Lenin's works on the question of war and peace. When officers and soldiers of a certain air force unit were studying that imperialism is the root of modern war, they exposed the aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism, which is expanding its armaments and preparing for war with a large number of facts. They said that we must heighten our vigilance, learn our skills well, and defend the socialist construction of our motherland and world peace.

Various services and arms of the military also held exhibitions, literary and artistic evenings, and published wall newspapers to introduce Lenin's life and revolutionary activities to the vast numbers of officers and soldiers and the local people.

    高度发扬列宁的革命精神　彻底揭露修正主义的面目
    全国各地隆重集会纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁诞生九十周年
    据新华社23日讯　中国共产党各省、市、自治区委员会普遍在21日和22日举行了大会，隆重纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁诞生九十周年。
    参加各地纪念大会的，有当地党、政府、军队和人民团体的负责人，全国人民代表大会代表和政协全国委员会委员，地方人民代表大会代表和政协委员，各民主党派地方组织的负责人，工业农业和各方面的先进生产者、先进工作者代表，著名教授、科学家和作家，以及其他各界人士。苏联和其他兄弟国家的总领事、领事，在各地帮助我国建设的各兄弟国家的专家，以及正在各地访问的兄弟国家代表团的代表，也应邀参加了纪念大会。
    各地党委负责人在纪念大会上作了报告。他们在报告中详细阐述了伟大列宁在保卫和发展马克思主义、指导全世界无产阶级革命和殖民地半殖民地革命运动等方面的丰功伟绩，严肃批判了以铁托为代表的现代修正主义者在关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政、关于战争与和平等问题上所散布的各种谬论，强调加强学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，高度发扬列宁的革命精神、彻底揭露现代修正主义真面目的重要意义；强调继续巩固和发展以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结。
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同在纪念会上作了题为“列宁主义是全世界无产阶级革命胜利的旗帜”的报告。他说，列宁毕生献身于无产阶级的革命事业，为全世界无产阶级和劳动人民的解放事业作出了不可估量的贡献。列宁主义的基本原理，在今天对于世界各国无产阶级革命事业仍然具有普遍的意义。舒同在谈到了中国革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，分析了目前的国际形势以后，强调指出，彻底粉碎现代修正主义，彻底粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋，是当前不能分割的两个严重的战斗任务。加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强国际共产主义运动的团结，是世界各国无产阶级和劳动人民制止战争、保卫和平，争取民族独立、人民民主和社会主义胜利的根本保证。中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣在纪念会上强调指出，屈从于帝国主义压力的现代修正主义者，歪曲和篡改列宁主义，大肆散布修正主义谬论，其目的是为帝国主义效劳。在纪念列宁诞生九十周年的时候，我们的任务就是要高高地举起列宁主义的旗帜，进一步加强国际无产阶级的团结，要更好地学习和保卫列宁的学说，彻底粉碎现代修正主义，保卫社会主义和共产主义事业永远胜利前进。
    中共浙江省委第一书记江华在报告中谈到，中国人民革命和建设事业的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利。我们党和我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，在领导我国革命和建设的过程中，在和各式各样的错误思想作斗争的过程中，不但创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，而且创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。我们要认真学习马克思列宁主义，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，进一步加强对现代修正主义的斗争，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性。中共江苏省委书记惠浴宇在报告中，从哲学、政治经济学、科学社会主义三个方面，分别说明列宁全面地创造性地发展了马克思主义，把马克思主义推进到一个新的阶段。他说，我们相信，在马克思列宁主义的指导下，新世界将一年一年的成长，旧世界将一年一年的崩溃。中共福建省委书记林一心说，中国共产党一贯高举列宁主义的旗帜，坚决同修正主义、机会主义进行不调和的斗争，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，并且创造性地发展着马克思列宁主义，从而使我国人民的革命事业所向披靡、战无不胜。
    中共湖北省委第一书记王任重在题为“用共产主义思想教育人民”的报告中说，列宁伟大的一生，为世界无产阶级革命和共产主义事业作出了伟大的贡献。列宁的学说是我们行动的指南，列宁的革命精神永远激动着我们的心灵。他说，我们共产党人的最终目的是伟大的共产主义，我们必须站在共产主义的高度来看社会主义。我们要学习列宁的榜样，以充沛的无产阶级革命热情，和不断革命的精神，来发展社会主义革命和建设，坚决地向资本主义的各种残余势力和思想影响作斗争，热情地歌颂和支持开始生长出来的共产主义的萌芽。我们应当在社会主义建设的过程中，用共产主义思想教育人民群众。中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎在报告中，着重阐述了列宁关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的一些重要原理，批判了以铁托为代表的现代修正主义者散布的“资本主义和平地自发地长入社会主义”和“国家消亡”等谬论。他说，现代修正主义者正在竭尽全力来反对无产阶级革命、反对无产阶级专政，抹煞工人阶级取得政权以后的阶级斗争，抹煞资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争，也抹煞国际范围内两个世界体系的斗争，胡说什么无产阶级国家成为超阶级的“独立力量”和“垄断者”。所有这些修正主义观点的目的，无非是取消无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。杨尚奎指出，现代国际共产主义运动的叛徒——南斯拉夫领导集团关于国家消亡的“理论”，并不是什么新鲜货色，而是从叛徒考茨基那里贩来的，是为一小撮剥削阶级服务的，是为资本帝国主义服务的。中共广东省委书记区梦觉在纪念大会上说，列宁在四十多年前就曾经指出，现代战争的根源在于帝国主义制度。目前，社会主义阵营的力量已经超过帝国主义的力量，已经有实际可能来防止帝国主义发动的侵略战争。但是帝国主义终究还是帝国主义，帝国主义还在时刻进行和准备局部战争，时刻准备世界战争。我们为了争取和实现真正的持久的和平，就必须继续加强保卫世界和平的力量，鼓舞世界人民的斗志，同帝国主义的侵略政策进行坚决的斗争。中共湖南省委书记周礼在分析了当前东风进一步压倒西风的国际有利形势以后指出，在这种力量对比日益不利于帝国主义战争势力的情况下，美国统治集团不得不被迫作出了某些和缓的表示。但是，正如列宁指出的，现代战争产生于帝国主义，由于帝国主义的三个基本矛盾的存在，也就存在战争的根源。帝国主义的本性就是掠夺。我们在主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处的同时，在坚决保卫世界和平的斗争中，对于以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略活动和战争阴谋，必须保持高度的警惕，必须遵循列宁所指引我们的以斗争求和平的道路前进。中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记伍晋南在报告中，以列宁诞生后的九十年来的世界历史和当前国际形势，论述了列宁主义过去、目前和将来对国际无产阶级革命的伟大指导意义。他强调指出，帝国主义对付世界人民有两手，一手是假和平；一手是战争。我们必须用两手来对付帝国主义，一手是大力揭露帝国主义的阴谋，争取世界和平；一手是提高警惕，时刻准备着用正义战争来消灭帝国主义的非正义战争。中共河南省委书记杨蔚屏在阐述了列宁主义的光辉和指导世界无产阶级革命的伟大意义以后，要求河南省广大干部进一步认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，从中吸取伟大的思想力量，牢固地树立起无产阶级的世界观，改进领导方法和工作作风，密切联系广大人民群众，更好地贯彻执行党的总路线。
    中共辽宁省委书记李荒在纪念会上说，列宁指示我们，反对修正主义是一个长期的斗争任务。现在世界局势比起列宁在世的时候，已经有了巨大的发展，已经形成了强大的社会主义世界，现在正是东风压倒西风，社会主义事业一天天好起来，帝国主义一天天烂下去的时候。就在这样社会主义革命空前胜利的形势下，又有现代修正主义的出现，这再一次证明列宁关于反对修正主义是长期的斗争任务这一指示是非常英明的。李荒说，现代修正主义是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。纪念列宁，就要学习列宁的革命精神，彻底粉碎现代修正主义。中共黑龙江省委书记强晓初在题为“纪念列宁，保卫马克思列宁主义”的报告中说，由列宁开创的十月革命胜利以后四十多年来，世界无产阶级和劳动人民革命事业已经取得了极其伟大的成就，这是伟大的列宁及其学说的不朽的功绩。我们每一个马克思列宁主义者，都应该自觉地站在斗争的最前列，向修正主义及各种机会主义坚决进行斗争，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为完成工人阶级的伟大历史任务而奋斗。中共吉林省委书记富振声在报告中说，我们纪念列宁，要学习列宁对待一切反马克思主义和修正主义的高度原则性和坚持不懈的斗争的革命品质，学习列宁对待阶级敌人的高度警惕性和毫不妥协的战斗精神。
    中共云南省委书记于一川在报告中说，列宁主义是从无产阶级革命斗争中产生出来的，具有鲜明的无产阶级革命的特色。列宁的思想在全世界劳动人民中间闪耀着无可磨灭的光辉，表现着强大的生命力。他指出，在目前的国际形势下，坚决反对现代修正主义，具有重大意义。我们必须组织全党全民开展一个学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作运动，这是我们纪念列宁诞生九十周年最有意义的活动。中共四川省委书记杜心源在报告中说，列宁的学说和列宁一生的革命实践，对于无产阶级革命事业和全人类的进步事业具有不可估量的意义。我们必须高举列宁主义的旗帜，学习列宁反对第二国际修正主义的精神，坚决对现代修正主义进行斗争，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，推动无产阶级革命运动从一个胜利走向一个胜利。中共重庆市委第一书记任白戈说，列宁主义思想已经越来越深入人心，列宁的伟大事业已经取得了辉煌的胜利。伟大的苏联已经进入了全面建设共产主义的时期，社会主义阵营日益强大，国际共产主义运动日益高涨，民族解放运动的风暴席卷了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。中共贵州省委书记处候补书记陈璞如在报告中指出，纪念伟大的列宁，学习和发扬列宁的革命斗争精神，对于中国人民的革命和建设事业，对于全世界劳动人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，都具有极其重要的意义。他说，我们的一切胜利，归根到底都是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利。中共西藏工委副书记郭锡兰在报告中说，列宁非常重视民族问题，他曾经多次指出民族问题是整个无产阶级革命的一个组成部分。中国共产党和毛泽东同志按照马克思列宁主义的原则，结合中国实际情况，制定了一套完全正确的民族政策。西藏一年来在平息叛乱、民主改革、维护祖国统一、加强民族团结和大力发展生产等方面都取得了辉煌的成就，这是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想在西藏的伟大胜利。他号召全体干部今后要坚持列宁主义关于民族问题的原则，贯彻执行党的民族政策，使西藏人民和祖国各兄弟民族一起走上社会主义的幸福康庄大道。
    中共陕西省委书记方仲如在题为“纪念列宁，学习列宁”的报告中指出，现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正在日益强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在空前广泛地发展起来，帝国主义由于本国内部的矛盾和帝国主义之间的矛盾尖锐化，正在分崩离析。这一切都表明列宁主义的伟大胜利。方仲如说，为了学习列宁主义和保卫列宁主义，必须彻底粉碎现代修正主义者曲解和阉割列宁学说的企图。中共甘肃省委书记陈曾固说，列宁的关于帝国主义理论、关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论、关于建设社会主义和共产主义的理论、关于农民问题的理论、关于民族和殖民地问题的理论、关于建党的学说，是对世界无产阶级革命事业的最伟大的贡献，是全世界人民争取解放的胜利武器。他号召大家要很好地学习列宁的理论和学说，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫社会主义事业。中共青海省委书记谭生彬作了题为“高举列宁主义旗帜，沿着社会主义—共产主义道路前进”的报告。他指出，当我们进入社会主义建设持续跃进阶段的时候，学习列宁主义的根本目的，就是为了去认识、掌握和运用事物发展的客观规律，来高速度按比例地发展社会主义建设事业，继续发动群众，鼓足干劲，为了完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，实现第二个五年计划后三年的更好的继续跃进，提前两年或三年实现全国农业发展纲要而努力。中共宁夏回族自治区委员会书记李景林说，在纪念列宁诞生九十周年的时候，我们应该学习列宁保卫马克思主义的精神，反对修正主义，坚持莫斯科社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言的精神，坚决保卫马克思列宁主义，促进国际无产阶级解放事业的胜利。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记处候补书记林渤民说，列宁主义是全世界无产阶级和进步人类为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的胜利的旗帜。纪念列宁诞生九十周年，要更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，认真地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习列宁的革命的战斗精神，更好地团结自己、打击敌人。
    中共内蒙古自治区党委候补书记胡昭衡说，在东风压倒西风的新时代，必须坚决反对以铁托为代表的现代修正主义者对马克思列宁主义的任何修正和歪曲。胡昭衡指出，毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想是我国各族人民智慧的最高结晶，是照耀我们前进的灯塔。中国革命和建设的胜利，内蒙古自治区革命和建设的胜利，都是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利。中共山西省委常委、省委秘书长史纪言说，我们中国共产党人和中国人民，对于列宁感到格外亲切，这是因为中国革命和建设的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，因为列宁对于中国革命曾经给予特别的关怀。我们纪念列宁，要学习列宁主义，坚持和保卫列宁主义，同时要把学习列宁主义和目前正在开展的学习毛泽东著作运动结合起来。
    各地纪念大会结束以后，都放映了有关列宁的影片，或演出了有关列宁的戏剧和音乐节目。
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军陆、海、空军部队，连日来广泛开展各种活动，隆重纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁诞生九十周年。
    解放军总部和驻京各部队、机关、院校，都分别举行了纪念大会。海军和空军领导机关在20日联合举行的报告会上，请艾思奇作了报告。驻广州、南京、沈阳、武汉、成都、昆明、济南、兰州和福建前线的部队，也都普遍举行了纪念会和报告会。
    各部队官兵热烈掀起学习列宁著作的高潮。北京地区某部在干部中组织了列宁著作学习小组，认真学习列宁关于战争与和平问题的著作。空军某部官兵在学习关于帝国主义是现代战争的根源时，以大量的事实揭露了美帝国主义正在扩军备战的侵略阴谋。他们说，我们一定要提高警惕，学好本领，保卫祖国社会主义建设和世界和平。
    各军种、兵种部队还举行了展览会、文艺晚会和出版了墙报，向广大官兵和驻地人民介绍列宁的生平事迹和革命活动。
