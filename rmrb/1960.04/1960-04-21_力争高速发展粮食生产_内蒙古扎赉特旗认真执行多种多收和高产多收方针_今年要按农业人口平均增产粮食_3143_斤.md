Strive for Rapid Development of Grain Production
Zhalai Special Banner in Inner Mongolia Conscientiously Implements the Policy of Planting More and Harvesting More, and High Yields and More Harvests.
This Year, Grain Production Will Increase by an Average of 3,143 Jin Per Agricultural Person

(Our Newspaper News) The Zhalai Special Banner in Inner Mongolia strives to produce an average of 3,143 jin of grain per agricultural person this year.

In 1960, the total cultivated land area of ​​Zhalai Special Banner was more than 1,619,000 mu, an increase of 12.2% compared with 1958. Among them, the grain crop area was more than 1,468,000 mu, accounting for 90.7% of the cultivated land. The planned average yield per mu is 299.5 jin, and the total output will reach 220,000 tons, an increase of 15.8% compared with 1959, and an average of 3,143 jin of grain will be produced per agricultural person.

In order to achieve this high-yield target, the whole Banner will take the following specific measures:

First, conscientiously implement the two-pronged approach of planting more to harvest more and striving for high yields and more harvests. In addition to harrowing, cultivating, leveling and compacting all the land ploughed last autumn and the spring-ploughed area expanded this year, all communes concentrate their efforts on spring ploughing and land reclamation. All paddy fields and increased fields must be spring-ploughed. At present, 176,220 mu have been reclaimed. The Banner will also expand the area of ​​high-yield crops, with high-yield and bumper-yield fields accounting for 45% of the total cultivated land area, requiring 20,000 mu with a yield of 600 jin per mu, 10,000 mu with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and 100,000 mu to be transformed from low-yield to high-yield fields. The area of ​​high-yield crops should account for more than 60% of the total cultivated land, and at the same time, the area of ​​paddy fields should be expanded by 41,224 mu, increasing to 212,646 mu.

Second, vigorously carry out farmland water conservancy construction, planning to have 6 mu of drought and flood-resistant and high-yield fields for each agricultural person. The Banner has 700,000 mu of spring water collection land. Since last winter, a total of 1,600 large and small projects have been completed, with a total of 3,193,036 cubic meters of earth and stone work completed, accounting for 73.1% of the annual task. The spring water collection of 150,000 mu has been completed. At present, we continue to focus on high-efficiency water conservancy, spring water collection land and projects that will benefit in the same year, basically realizing the construction task of having 6 mu of drought and flood-resistant and high-yield fields for each agricultural person.

Third, vigorously engage in fertilizer accumulation, realizing that all mature land is fertilized with 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, requiring a total of 6.7 billion jin of fertilizer. A total of 6.6 billion jin have been accumulated, and 93% of the manure has been sent to the fields.

Fourth, vigorously carry out tool reform to realize the semi-mechanization of spring ploughing production. Now 19,205 pieces of advanced tools have been reformed, manufactured and promoted, and 14,588 old farm tools have been repaired and matched.

Fifth, the seeds should be localized, high-yielding and high-quality, and the germination rate and purity should reach more than 95%. Three or four germination tests have been carried out, and the germination rate has reached more than 95%.

    力争高速发展粮食生产
    内蒙古扎赉特旗认真执行多种多收和高产多收方针
    今年要按农业人口平均增产粮食3143斤
    本报讯　内蒙古扎赉特旗力争今年粮食按农业人口平均计算：每人生产三千一百四十三斤。
    扎赉特旗1960年总耕地面积是一百六十一万九千多亩，比1958年增加12.2％，其中粮食作物面积一百四十六万八千多亩，占耕地90.7％，计划平均每亩单产二百九十九点五斤，总产量将达到二十二万吨，比1959年增加15.8％，平均每个农业人口生产粮食三千一百四十三斤。
    为了达到这个高产指标，全旗将采取以下的具体措施：
    一、认真贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收两条腿走路的方针。各公社除对去年秋耕地和今年扩大的春翻面积全部进行耙耘平整镇压外，集中力量春翻开荒，对水田和增加的田地要做到全部春翻，目前已开荒十七万六千二百二十亩。全旗还将扩大高产作物面积，高额丰产田要占总耕地面积的45％，要求其中亩产六百斤的二万亩，亩产一千斤的一万亩，有十万亩要由低产变为高产田。高产作物面积要占总耕地60％以上，同时扩大水田四万一千二百二十四亩，增加到二十一万二千六百四十六亩。
    二、大搞农田水利建设，计划每个农业人口要有六亩旱涝保丰收田。全旗春汇地七十万亩，去冬以来共完成大小工程一千六百处，完成土石方达三百一十九万三千零三十六立方米，占全年任务的73.1％，并完成春汇十五万亩，当前继续抓水利高工效，抓春汇地和当年受益工程，基本上要实现每个农业人口有六亩旱涝保丰收田的建设任务。
    三、大搞积肥，实现全部熟地亩施肥料五千斤，共需肥六十七亿斤，现在共积六十六亿斤，并有93％的粪肥送到地里。
    四、大搞工具改革，实现春耕生产半机械化。现在已改革、制造、推广先进工具一万九千二百零五件，整修配套旧农具一万四千五百八十八副。
    五、种籽实现当地高产优良化，发芽率和纯度要求达到95％以上，已作发芽试验三、四次，发芽率均达95％以上。
