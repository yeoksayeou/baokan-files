Comrades, Delegates:
    I firmly support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will report to the Congress on the situation of the Third Engineering Section of the Sixth Engineering Company of Hunan Province in organizing indigenous and foreign machinery into complete sets.
    Under the leadership of the Party, our engineering section has entered 1960 with a heroic pace after achieving two consecutive years of great leaps forward. All employees, with a fighting posture and soaring energy, fired the first shot of a good start this year, completing the first quarter's tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.
     Currently, a new high tide of mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, is unfolding in the entire section with the force of ten thousand horses galloping.
    Our section originally relied on backward manual operations. The red bricks used for building walls were carried bucket by bucket from the ground to the scaffolding, which was laborious and inefficient. During the Great Leap Forward last year, all employees emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, relied on their own efforts, made use of whatever was available, and vigorously developed indigenous mechanical equipment. At the beginning of the year, they produced 56 kinds of indigenous machinery, totaling 1,814 pieces. In the second half of the year, these machines were further selected, standardized, and gradually refined, from foot-operated and hand-cranked to mechanical and electric. They were organized into complete sets according to work types and processes, forming "one-stop" lines, achieving a comprehensive level of 54.78% of semi-mechanization and mechanization. Since February this year, in response to the Party's call, we have vigorously engaged in a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and have fully equipped the 46 processes of six major engineering projects into "one-stop" mechanized and semi-mechanized construction assembly lines, forming a complete set of experience. Among them, steel bar production and concrete tamping have been transformed from "indigenous dragons" to "foreign dragons." This has greatly simplified the engineering process, with work efficiency increasing by two to three times, and in some cases even seven to eight times. Since the beginning of this year, our section has reduced the number of technical workers by more than 150 (26%), while the actual amount of work completed in January has doubled compared to December last year, and in February it increased by another 47% compared to January. In March, we transferred another 103 people to support other units. Through the comprehensive coordination into "one-stop" lines, not only has manpower been greatly saved, work efficiency improved, and the progress of the project accelerated, but also the crowded and chaotic phenomenon on the site has been completely changed. The effects are mainly reflected in the following five aspects: (1) Improving work efficiency and saving labor. After coordination, many processes are closely connected. For example, sieving and washing stones used to require six processes and ten people, completing only 30 cubic meters per day. After coordination, there is only one process, with four people feeding the material, completing 60 cubic meters per day. Taking the Hunan Hotel project currently being built by our section as an example, after all the tools are fully equipped, more than 23,070 labor days can be saved. (2) Effectively ensuring project quality and safe production. In particular, for concrete projects, the comprehensive use of mechanical operations can more scientifically master the operating procedures and quality standards, and greatly reduce safety and quality accidents. (3) Fully leveraging the utilization rate of existing machinery. After the machinery is coordinated,联动化 operation is realized, effectively overcoming the phenomenon of infrequent use of single machines in the past; at the same time, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient equipment power. (4) Further promoting the improvement of the level of mechanization. After combining the existing indigenous and foreign machinery according to the work sequence, some shortcomings can be quickly overcome. (5) Greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers' operations. Workers celebrated with gongs and drums, rejoicing that the carrying pole of several thousand kilograms on their shoulders has been thrown away. Huang Zhiqing, an elderly worker in his fifties, handed the carrying pole to the leader and said excitedly: "This carrying pole has weighed me down for decades. Now, thanks to the Communist Party, my shoulders have finally been liberated." Workers happily sang:
    Mechanization, mechanization, everyone supports and praises,
    Less effort, greater effect, high speed depends on it.
    How did our engineering section launch the mass movement of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and organizing indigenous and foreign machinery into complete sets?
    First, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and vigorously engaging in mass movements is the key to organizing indigenous and foreign machinery into complete sets. Vigorously engaging in the coordinated development of indigenous and foreign machinery is an important link in the new stage of technological innovation and technological revolution in the construction industry. In the process of advancement, there is a struggle between two roads and two methods. A small number of people believe that production is busy, tasks are tight, innovation takes time, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Taking people out to engage in coordination will make it difficult to complete the current tasks; some believe that all the innovations that should be done have already been done, and nothing new can be innovated; some believe that indigenous machinery cannot solve the problem and is prone to problems, making it difficult to take responsibility. These views are essentially a reflection of right-leaning conservative thinking. The vast majority of people believe that the greater the production task and the tighter the construction period, the more vigorously innovation must be carried out to ensure the completion of the task, and firmly believe in the innovative wisdom of the masses. In response to these situations, the Party general branch launched a broad-based debate among employees. The questions for the debate were: Can we increase production without increasing manpower? Can technological innovation be carried out? Where is the potential? How to do it? Through debate, the ideological awareness of employees was raised, their understanding was unified, and they actively participated in the movement. In two weeks, a total of 5,010 rationalization proposals were put forward, making the movement develop rapidly and vigorously.
    Second, in the past, the new machines and tools we created and trial-produced had a "three-more" phenomenon due to the lack of close attention to the appraisal work, namely, more styles and varieties, more manpower occupied, and more damage and loss. Therefore, the use was not frequent, the utilization rate was not high, and the further improvement of the level of mechanized construction was affected. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we proposed to resolutely realize "three-化", namely, mechanical standardization, the associated processes are matched as a set, and one machine is multi-purpose. After the overall coordination and filling in the missing parts, there are now eight sets of "masonry bricklaying project ""one-stop construction" and mechanized and semi-mechanized steel bar making and tying, which respectively increased the work efficiency by one to eight times.
    Third, resolutely implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and relying on our own efforts. This year, the construction task is large, and the construction machinery is insufficient. After discussion, the employees unanimously realized that it is impossible to rely solely on the higher authorities to solve the problem, and the most important thing is to resolutely implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and relying on our own efforts. Now the entire section has more than 70 sets of indigenous and foreign machinery, all of which are manufactured by the workers themselves. Through self-reliance and vigorously developing indigenous mechanical equipment, we are not only skilled craftsmen in mud and wood work, but also more than 40 people have learned the operating techniques of electric welding, fitter, lathe worker, cold worker, sand turning, and motor chemical industry. These coordinated equipment are produced by our workers while thinking and working. The workers have passed down such a folk song:
    Advanced machinery is very important, manual work is not as good as mechanical,
    Use your own creation to guarantee production leap forward.
    Fourth, the mass movement of technological innovation should be closely combined with socialist competition. Since the beginning of the battle to organize a good start this year, the leaders of our department have mobilized the masses of employees to launch a high tide of competition in which you chase me and each other through breaking three levels, matching eight dragons, fighting martial arts, challenging, inserting red flags, establishing models, and holding technical performance competitions, so that the work efficiency has generally increased by more than 50%, and the phenomenon of not reaching the quota has been eliminated. More than 36% of the teams have doubled their work efficiency. Through the competition, we have become more aware of the importance of engaging in innovation. For example, some workers reflected: "You have to use advanced machinery to engage in competition, otherwise you will stumble." This shows that vigorously carrying out the competition movement can make the technological innovation movement more extensive and in-depth.
    Although we have made some achievements in vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and organizing indigenous and foreign machinery into complete sets, our work is still far from meeting the requirements of the high-speed development of the entire socialist construction cause. In the future, we will ensure that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, we will guard against arrogance and impatience, unremittingly muster greater revolutionary efforts, and strive to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation.

    技术革新中出现的土洋机具要迅速配套成龙
    刘正良代表谈技术革新的配套推广主席、各位代表：
    我坚决拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。现在我就湖南省六工程公司三工程处组织土洋机具配套成龙的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    我工程处在党的领导下，在取得两年连续跃进的伟大成绩后，又以豪迈的步伐跨入了1960年。全体职工以战斗的姿态，冲天的干劲，打响了今年开门红的第一炮，提前和超额完成了第一季度的任务。
      目前一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新与技术革命的群众运动新高潮，正以万马奔腾之势，在全处开展起来。
    我处原来都是落后的手工操作，砌墙用的红砖，都是用人工一担一担从地下挑到脚手架上，劳动笨重，工效又低。在去年大跃进中，全体职工解放思想，破除迷信，自力更生，因陋就简，大搞土机械设备，在年初制成了土机具五十六种，一千八百一十四件。下半年进一步把这些机具全面进行选型、定型，逐步由粗到精，由脚踏手摇到机械电动，按工种、工序组织成套配成“一条龙”，已综合达到半机械化与机械化程度54.78％。今年2月以来，我们响应党的号召，大闹以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新与技术革命的群众运动，把六个主要工程项目的四十六道工序，又全盘配成了“一条龙”机械化半机械化施工流水线，形成了成套的经验。其中钢筋制作、混凝土捣固已由“土龙”变成了“洋龙”。这就大大地简化了工程过程，工效分别提高两倍到三倍，有的甚至提高七倍到八倍。今年以来我处减少技术工人一百五十多人（26％），而元月份比去年12月份，实际完成的工程量反翻了一番，2月份比元月份又增长了47％，3月份我们又抽出了一百零三人，支援其他单位。通过全面配套成“龙”，不仅大大节省了人力，提高了工效，加速了工程进度，而且彻底改变了现场上的拥挤混乱现象。其效果主要体现在以下五个方面：（1）提高工效，节约劳力。配套以后，很多工序紧密衔接起来，如筛洗石子，过去要六道工序，十人操作，每天仅完成三十立方米；配套以后，只有一道工序，四个人上料，每天可完成六十立方米。以目前我处所建的湖南宾馆工程为例，在工具全部配成套以后，即可节省二万三千零七十多个劳动工日。（2）切实保证工程质量和安全生产。特别是混凝土工程，全面采用机械操作，更能科学的掌握操作规程和质量标准，并大大减少了安全和质量事故。（3）充分发挥了现有机械利用率。机械配套以后，实现联动化操作，有效的克服过去单机使用不经常的现象；同时克服设备动力不足的困难。（4）进一步促进机械化水平的提高。按工序将现有土洋机械进行联合配套以后，使得一些缺门迅速突破补上去。（5）大大减轻了工人操作中的劳动强度。工人们敲锣打鼓，庆贺压在肩膀上几千斤的扁担，从此扔掉了。五十多岁的老年工人黄之庆同志把扁担交给领导时，激动地说：“这条扁担压了我好几十年，如今搭帮共产党，我的肩膀从此翻了身。”工人们愉快的歌颂：
    机械化，机械化，　人人拥护个个夸，
    费力小，效果大，　实现高速度要靠它。
    我们工程处大搞技术革新和技术革命、组织土洋机械配套成龙的运动，是怎样开展起来的呢？
    第一，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，这是组织土洋机械配套成龙的重要关键。大搞土洋机械配套成龙，是建筑业技术革新和技术革命进入新阶段的一个重要环节，在前进的过程中，是存在着两条道路和两种方法的斗争的，一小部分人认为生产忙，任务紧，革新费时间，远水难救近火，抽出人来搞配套，就难以完成当前任务；有的认为要革新的都早已革完了，再革也革不出什么名堂；有的认为土机械不能解决问题，又容易出毛病，责任难当。这些看法，实质上是右倾保守思想的反映。绝大多数人则认为，生产任务越大，工期越紧，就越要大力搞革新，完成任务才能有保证，并且坚信群众的革新智慧。党总支针对这些情况，发动职工广泛开展了鸣放辩论。辩论的问题是：增产不增人，能不能办到？技术革新能不能搞起来？潜力在哪里？如何搞？通过辩论，提高了职工的思想觉悟，统一了认识，积极投入了运动，在两个星期中，共提出合理化建议五千零一十条，使运动得到了迅猛蓬勃的开展。
    第二，过去我们创造和试制的新机具，由于鉴定工作抓得不够紧，而发生“三多”现象，即式样品种多，占用劳动力多，损坏散失多。因此使用不经常，利用率不高，影响机械化施工水平进一步提高。为了克服这些缺点，我们提出坚决实现“三化”，即机械定型标准化，相联工序成套化，一机多用化。经过全面配套，补齐缺件，现在已经配套成龙的有“泥工砌砖工程”“一条龙施工”和钢筋制作绑扎机械化与半机械化等八套，分别提高工效一到八倍。
    第三，坚决贯彻执行土洋结合自力更生的方针。今年施工任务大，施工机械不足，职工们经过讨论，一致认识到单纯依靠上级解决是不可能的，最主要的是坚决执行土洋结合、自力更生的方针。现在全处拥有土洋机具七十多台，全部都是工人自己制造的。通过自力更生，大搞土机械设备，我们不仅是泥木工中的巧匠，还有四十多人学会了电焊、钳工、车工、冷作工、翻砂以及电机化工的操作技术。这些机具配套是我们工人一边想，一边干搞出来的。工人们流传着这样一首歌谣：
    先进机具很重要，　手工不如机械妙，
    自己使用自己造，　保证生产闹飞跃。
    第四，大搞技术革新运动要与社会主义竞赛紧密结合起来。今年自组织开门红的战斗以来，我处领导上就发动职工群众，通过破三关、配八龙、打擂比武、挑战应战、大插红旗、大树标兵、大搞技术表演赛等形式，掀起了你追我赶的竞赛高潮，使工效普遍提高50％以上，消灭了达不到定额的现象。还有36％以上队组，工效翻番。通过竞赛，使我们更加认识到搞革新的重要性，如有的工人反映：“搞竞赛非得用先进机具不可，不用就会跌跤子”。这正说明了，大力开展竞赛运动，就能使技术革新运动更广泛、更深入的开展起来。
    我们在大闹技术革新和技术革命，组织土洋机具配套成龙方面，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是对整个社会主义建设事业高速度发展的要求来讲，我们的工作还是很不够的，今后我们保证在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，戒骄戒躁，坚持不懈地鼓足更大的革命干劲，努力实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。
