    The Loud Voice of 1.7 Billion People
    —A Record of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
    By our reporter Chen Jun

    The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference successfully concluded on April 15th. From Conakry, the capital of Guinea, it announced to the world the firm will of the Asian and African people: to resolutely oppose imperialism, eradicate colonialism, and strive for a new world of independence, freedom, prosperity, and peace as soon as possible. The 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa will unite closely for this noble cause and carry out a common struggle.

    Strengthening Unity in Common Struggle
    Since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind and the great development of the national liberation movement have brought about even more tremendous changes in Asia and Africa. The increasingly awakened and united people of Asia and Africa, sympathizing with and supporting each other, have formed an invincible force. All the delegates at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference regarded this great unity as a guarantee for the victory of the Asian and African people in their struggle for liberation. Delegates from Asian countries—China, Korea, Vietnam, India, Japan, and Indonesia—made a solemn guarantee to the African people that the Asian people resolutely stand with the African people, supporting their struggle until final victory. Similarly, delegates from African countries strongly condemned American imperialism's occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and Japan's territory of Okinawa, the artificial division of Korea and Vietnam, the aggressive acts of Portugal continuing to occupy India's Goa, and the Netherlands refusing to return West Irian to the Indonesian people. They firmly supported Asian countries in opposing foreign military bases, foreign troops, opposing the U.S. concluding a military alliance with Japan and interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and other activities that intensified tensions in Asia. The delegate from Algeria, speaking on behalf of all African countries at the conference, expressed the will of the people of Asia and Africa to unite against imperialism and colonialism.

    The Algerian Revolution is a Symbol of African People's Liberation
    The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference reflected the new situation of the African national liberation movement in the past two years. The flames of opposition to imperialism and colonialism have spread throughout the African continent, and the imperialists who refuse to give up colonial rule are intensifying their collusion, adopting all means to carry out a frantic struggle. In this increasingly acute struggle, more and more African people have embarked on the road of more resolute struggle. The voice of "Uhuru," "Uhuru" (African language: freedom) constantly resounded throughout the venue. When the envoys of the Algerian people appeared on the podium, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly. The African people regarded the six-year Algerian national liberation war as a "symbol of the liberation of the African people." The strong expression of the entire African people sharing the same fate and breathing the same air as the Algerian people is not only a tremendous source of encouragement for the heroic Algerian people, but also shows that the African people, awakened from deep suffering, have realized that the Algerian people's road to liberation is their common road to freedom. The delegate from Cameroon announced that the Cameroonian people must carry out the armed struggle to the end, and a provisional revolutionary government would soon be established. The delegate from Kenya said that the blood of the martyrs who sacrificed for Kenya's independence has irrigated the seeds of freedom scattered on the earth, and the tree of freedom will eventually sprout and grow in Kenya. The impatient desire for independence was overflowing in the speeches of every African delegate. Delegates from Kenya, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Zanzibar, one after another, passionately declared their demands: "Immediate independence, not tomorrow, but today!" They demanded independence in 1960.

    Embarking on the Road of More Heroic Struggle
    However, the imperialists will not let go of Africa. The French colonial army's intensified attacks on the Algerian people and the South African white government's bloody massacre of Africans demanding the abolition of the "pass laws" are proof of this. If one were not personally at the venue, personally in contact with the delegates from African countries, it would be difficult to appreciate the African people's righteous indignation at this brutality of imperialism. At the opening ceremony of the conference, all the delegates stood in silence to mourn the martyrs who died in South Africa in the struggle against the "pass laws." They severely condemned South Africa's policy of racial discrimination and exposed the role played by British and American imperialists as accomplices of the South African racists. Guinean delegate Ismael Touré said: De Gaulle withdrew his promise to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination and announced that he would continue the colonial war; the South African colonial government's bloody massacre of peaceful residents demanding the abolition of racial discrimination fully exposed the heinous face of imperialism and racism. However, whether from the conference, from group discussions, or from individual conversations with the delegates, one could deeply feel that the brutality of imperialists and colonialists had not been able to intimidate the African people, but on the contrary, had prompted the African people to embark on a more heroic and tenacious struggle. After painfully condemning the atrocities of the white government, the South African delegate raised his clenched fist and shouted loudly: "We can no longer endure it! The revolution in South Africa is coming, no matter what form it takes. It would not be surprising even if a violent revolutionary form appeared in South Africa." Representatives from the colonial peoples of Nyasaland, Rhodesia, Uganda, Tanganyika, Somaliland, Angola, Ruanda-Urundi, and others expressed their great determination to strive for independence regardless of imperialist suppression. The Senegalese delegate passionately stated: "The African people will continue the struggle until the day when all African countries have gained independence."

    Be Vigilant Against the Colonialists' Sham Independence Swindle
    This year, a series of countries in Africa, such as Togo, Nigeria, Congo, and Somaliland, will achieve independent status. The delegates present congratulated these countries. However, the African people have realized that imperialists and colonialists, when forced to retreat, are intensifying their activities to create sham independence. African delegates call this sham independence one of the forms of neo-colonialism. Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, called on the African people to be vigilant. In exposing this neo-colonialist deception, he pointed out that France recognized the independence of the Mali Federation, but retained control over defense, diplomacy, finance, etc., and stationed French troops there. Belgium allowed the independence of the Congo, but is trying hard to retain its privileges and is carrying out various provocations, creating internal chaos in the Congo. Moumié, Secretary-General of the Cameroon People's Union, accused the French colonialists of creating Cameroon's sham independence and continuing to massacre the Cameroonian people, and the French general, notorious in the Algerian colonial war, commanded the attacks on the Cameroonian people's armed forces.

    Seeing Through the Ugly Face of American Neo-Colonialism
    More and more African countries have also seen through the fact that American imperialism is a neo-colonialist wearing the banner of "sympathy" and "friendship." A representative from Somaliland told reporters: Wherever there is British, French, or Belgian colonial rule, there are representatives of American imperialism and American companies. The delegate from Zanzibar said that imperialists are colluding with each other "to maintain their colonial rule over Africa with weapons and money. Without American weapons, the French colonial army would not be able to continue the colonial war in Algeria. Without American support, the South African government's policy of racial discrimination would not be able to run rampant to this day." The delegate from Kenya said, "About two hundred years ago, Washington led America's anti-colonialist war, but America has long forgotten the suffering it suffered under colonial oppression and has itself "become a brutal colonialist of our time." Today, American imperialism is not only a supporter of French, British, Belgian, and other colonialists in Africa, and a supporter of the South African colonial government, but also controls Japan and occupies other countries' lands in Asia. At the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, one could find many facts to expose the true face of American neo-colonialists. Many delegates, when discussing the issue of aid to underdeveloped countries, emphasized the need to rely mainly on self-reliance, and called on Asian and African countries to support and help each other, while "U.S. aid" is a means for American imperialism to infiltrate. The Guinean delegate, in the discussion of the economic group at the conference, directly exposed this false compassion of imperialism, believing that imperialism would never take out money to help backward countries develop their economies. And some representatives of countries controlled by American imperialism no longer dared to openly defend American imperialism in the tone of imperialist agents.

    There Can Be No Peaceful Coexistence with Imperialism
    Imperialists and modern revisionists have tried to shift the target of the Asian and African people's opposition to imperialism and colonialism, replacing it with things like so-called "active coexistence." However, the Asian and African people, from their own experience, have been able to distinguish between these major issues. Delegates from Asian and African countries expressed their desire for world peace and peaceful coexistence at the conference; however, they did not have any illusions about imperialism, believing that there could be no peaceful coexistence with imperialism and colonialism. Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, put it well, peaceful coexistence must be specifically explained, and only by eliminating imperialism and colonialism can there be true peaceful coexistence. He further explained that in the struggle against imperialism, it is impossible to be "neutral." The Algerian delegate, when calling on the world to support the Algerian people's struggle, also said, "We find it difficult to agree with the neutral attitude that some countries still adopt on the Algerian war issue. In our view, our just struggle should be supported by all good people." More delegates talked about the fact that the Asian and African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism is an important force in the struggle for world peace, and only by ending imperialism and colonialism can there be world peace. Imperialism is afraid of the unity of the Asian and African people.

    Never Let Imperialism's Divisive Conspiracy Succeed
    Inside and outside the venue of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, there appeared many suspicious figures of all kinds, carrying out sneaky activities. They forged Guo Moruo's "congratulatory telegram" and released several poisonous arrows to undermine the relations between Asian and African countries and China, attempting to poison the atmosphere of the conference. They also forged a document on the Tibet issue distributed in the name of the Indian delegation, viciously slandering China and undermining Sino-Indian relations. However, these conspiratorial activities could not be exposed to the sun, and once they surfaced, they were immediately exposed by the solemn exposure of the Chinese and Indian delegations and disappeared. Imperialist elements also tried to undermine the friendly relations between China and Guinea. On the very day that the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe performed for the first time in Conakry for the delegates of the conference, those imperialist elements who were hostile to Asian-African unity carried out the shameful activity of anonymous intimidation. However, the unity of the Asian and African people, the unity of China and the Asian and African countries, cannot be destroyed by these demons and monsters. In particular, the Chinese people's consistent opposition to imperialism and colonialism, and their firm stand in fully supporting the Asian and African people's struggle against colonialism, has long been deeply understood by the people of all Asian and African countries, who regard China as their most reliable friend. Whether at the conference, in group meetings, or in contact with Chinese representatives, representatives of various countries expressed the greatest trust and affection for the Chinese people in an extremely friendly manner. Inside and outside the venue, one could often hear the following voices: "What China has done, we can also do"; many representatives also said, "China is our example." As some representatives said at the conference: "The truth cannot be covered up"! Imperialists' activities to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries have aroused the high vigilance of Asian and African countries. Guinean President Sékou Touré and Conference Chairman Ismael Touré repeatedly emphasized this point in their speeches. Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, said: Disputes between Asian and African countries can be resolved through friendly consultations. For the sake of our common struggle and common interests, Asian and African countries must unite as one. We must not let the imperialists divide us. To this end, the importance of the unity of the Asian and African people was emphasized in all the major resolutions passed by the conference.

    The spirit of the Bandung Conference, the resolutions of the Cairo Conference, and the victory of the Conakry Conference have firmly laid the foundation for the rock-solid unity between the Asian and African people. This is something that no imperialist and all reactionaries can destroy. "Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!" is the loudest slogan of this conference, and it is also the lighthouse that leads the Asian and African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism to final victory. Let the imperialists and colonialists tremble under the iron fists of the great unity of the Asian and African people!

    十七亿人民的响亮呼声
    ——记第二届亚非人民团结大会
    本报记者　陈浚
    第二届亚非人民团结大会已经在4月15日胜利闭幕了。从几内亚的首都科纳克里向全世界宣布了亚非人民的坚强意志：坚决反对帝国主义，铲除殖民主义，争取独立、自由、繁荣与和平的新世界早日到来。亚非十七亿人民将为这个崇高的事业紧密地团结起来，进行共同的斗争。
    在共同的斗争中加强团结
    自从第一届亚非人民团结大会以来，东风压倒西风的形势，民族解放运动的大发展，已经使亚非两大洲发生了更加巨大的变化。日益觉醒和团结起来的亚非人民，互相同情，互相支持，已经结成了不可战胜的力量。这个伟大的团结，在第二届亚非人民团结大会上，被所有的代表看成是亚非人民争取解放斗争胜利的保证。来自亚洲各国——中国、朝鲜、越南、印度、日本、印度尼西亚的代表们，向非洲人民提出庄严的保证，亚洲人民坚决地与非洲人民站在一起，支持他们的斗争，直到最后胜利。同样，非洲各国的代表们强烈地谴责了美国帝国主义侵占中国的领土台湾和日本的领土冲绳，人为地分裂朝鲜和越南，谴责了葡萄牙继续霸占印度的果阿、荷兰拒绝把西伊里安交还给印度尼西亚人民等的侵略行为，坚决支持亚洲国家反对外国军事基地、外国驻军，反对美国同日本缔结军事同盟和干涉老挝内政等加紧亚洲紧张局势的活动。阿尔及利亚的代表在大会上代表非洲所有的国家讲话，表示了亚非两洲人民团结一致、反对帝国主义和殖民主义的意志。
    阿尔及利亚革命是非洲人民解放的象征
    第二届亚非人民团结大会反映出了两年来非洲民族解放运动的新形势，反对帝国主义、殖民主义的烈火已经燃遍了整个非洲大陆，而不肯放弃殖民统治的帝国主义者，加紧勾结起来，采取一切手段，进行疯狂的挣扎。在这种日益尖锐的斗争里，越来越多的非洲人民走上了更加坚决斗争的道路。“乌呼鲁”，“乌呼鲁”
  （非洲语：自由）的声音不断地响彻整个会场。当阿尔及利亚人民的使者出现在讲台上的时候，全场起立热烈鼓掌，非洲人民把进行了六年的阿尔及利亚民族解放战争看成是“非洲人民解放的象征”。整个非洲人民同阿尔及利亚人民同命运、共呼吸的强烈表现，不只对于英勇的阿尔及利亚人民是一种巨大的鼓舞力量，并且也表明了从深重的灾难里觉醒过来的非洲人民，已经认识到阿尔及利亚人民争取解放的道路就是他们争取自由的共同道路。喀麦隆的代表宣布，喀麦隆人民一定要把武装斗争进行到底，不久，将要成立临时的革命政府。怯尼亚的代表说，为怯尼亚独立而牺牲的烈士们的鲜血，已经灌溉了散播在大地上的自由种子，自由之树终将在怯尼亚发芽成长。那种争取独立迫不及待的心情，洋溢在每一个非洲代表的发言里。怯尼亚、塞拉勒窝内、塞内加尔、桑给巴尔的代表们，一个接着一个激昂地申明了他们的要求：“立即独立、不是在明天，而是在今天！”他们要求1960年得到独立。
    走上更加英勇斗争的道路
    然而，帝国主义者是不会在非洲松手的。法国殖民军队加紧对阿尔及利亚人民进攻和南非白人政府对要求废除“通行证法”的非洲人进行血腥的屠杀，就是证明。如果不是亲身在会场，亲自接触到非洲各国的代表，是很难体会到非洲人民对于帝国主义这种暴行的义愤的。在大会开幕式上，全体代表肃立，为南非在反对“通行证法”斗争中死难的烈士默哀。他们严厉谴责南非的种族歧视政策，纷纷揭发英国和美国帝国主义者所扮演的作为南非种族主义者的帮凶的角色。几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔说：戴高乐撤回了承认阿尔及利亚人民自决权的诺言，宣布要把殖民战争继续下去；南非殖民政府对于要求废除种族歧视政策的和平居民进行的血腥屠杀，完全暴露了帝国主义和种族主义者凶恶的面目。但是，无论从大会上，从小组讨论中或是从代表们的个别交谈里，人们都可以深深地感到，帝国主义和殖民主义者的残暴不但没有能够吓倒非洲人民，而是适得相反，促使非洲人民走上了更加英勇顽强的斗争道路。南非代表在沉痛地控诉了白人政府的暴行之后，举起紧握着的拳头大声说：“我们再也不能忍受了！南非的革命不管采取什么形式，就要到来了。即使在南非出现暴力的革命形式，也是不足为怪的。”尼亚萨兰、罗得西亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀、索马里兰、安哥拉、卢安达—乌隆迪等殖民地人民的代表都表示了他们将不顾帝国主义的镇压而争取独立的伟大决心。塞内加尔代表慷慨陈词：“非洲人民一直要把斗争进行到全部非洲国家都获得独立的一天。”
    警惕殖民主义者的假独立骗局
    今年，在非洲还将有一系列国家，如多哥、尼日利亚、刚果和索马里兰等取得独立地位。到会的代表们向这些国家表示了祝贺。但是，非洲人民已经认识到，帝国主义者和殖民主义者在被迫退却的时候，正在加紧制造假独立的活动。非洲的代表们把这种假独立称之为新殖民主义的形式之一。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛要求非洲人民提高警惕。他在揭露这种新殖民主义的欺骗手段时指出，法国承认了马里联邦的独立，但是却在那里保留了对国防、外交、财政等等的控制权，并驻有法国军队。比利时允许了刚果的独立，但是，正在竭力保留它的特权，并且进行种种挑拨活动，制造刚果内部的混乱。喀麦隆人民联盟总书记穆米埃斥责法国殖民者制造喀麦隆的假独立，继续屠杀喀麦隆人民，而指挥着进攻喀麦隆人民武装的，就是在阿尔及利亚殖民战争中臭名远扬的法国将军。
    看穿了美国新殖民主义的嘴脸
    越来越多的非洲国家也看透了美帝国主义是打着“同情”和“友谊”招牌的新殖民主义者。一位索马里兰的代表对记者说：哪里有英国、法国或者比利时的殖民统治，哪里就有美帝国主义的代表和美国的公司。桑给巴尔的代表说，帝国主义正在互相纠合起来“用武器和金钱维护它们的对非洲的殖民统治。如果没有美国的武器，法国殖民军就无法继续在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。没有美国的支持，南非政府的种族歧视政策也不可能横行到今天。”怯尼亚的代表说，“约二百年前华盛顿领导了美国反殖民主义的战争，可是美国早已经忘掉了当年遭受殖民压迫的苦难，而自己却“成为当代残暴的殖民主义者”了。今天，美国帝国主义不仅在非洲是法国、英国、比利时等殖民主义者的支持者，是南非殖民政府的支持者，并且在亚洲也控制着日本，占领着别国的土地。在第二届亚非人民团结大会上，人们可以找到许多事实，来揭露美国新殖民主义者的真面目。不少代表，在讨论援助不发达国家的问题时，强调了要以自力更生为主，要求亚非国家互相支援和帮助，而“美援”是美帝国主义渗入的一种手段。几内亚的代表在大会经济小组的讨论中，曾经直截了当地戳穿了帝国主义这种假慈悲，认为帝国主义永远不会拿出钱来帮助落后国家发展经济的。而一些美帝国主义控制着的国家的代表再也不敢明目张胆地以帝国主义代理人的口吻出来公开为美帝国主义辩护。
    同帝国主义谈不上和平共处
    帝国主义者和现代修正主义者，曾经试图转移亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的目标，而代之以所谓“积极共处”之类的货色。但是，亚非人民从切身经验中，已经能够分清这种大是大非。亚非国家的代表们，纷纷在会上表示了对世界和平、和平共处的愿望；但是，他们都对帝国主义不抱任何幻想，认为同帝国主义和殖民主义谈不到什么和平共处。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛讲得好，和平共处必须加以具体的解释，只有消灭了帝国主义和殖民主义，才能有真正的和平共处。他并且进一步说明，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，不可能“中立”。阿尔及利亚代表在呼吁全世界支持阿尔及利亚人民斗争的时候也说，“我们很难同意一些国家在对待阿尔及利亚战争问题上仍然采取的中立的态度。在我们看来，我们所进行的正义斗争，应该得到一切善良人们的支持。”更多的代表们谈到了，亚非人民反对帝国主义反对殖民主义的斗争，是争取世界和平的一个重要力量，只有结束了帝国主义和殖民主义，才能有世界和平。帝国主义害怕亚非人民的团结。
    决不让帝国主义的分裂阴谋得逞
    第二届亚非人民团结大会的会场内外出现了不少形形色色的可疑人物，进行着鬼鬼祟祟的活动。他们伪造了郭沫若的“贺电”，放出了几支破坏亚非国家同中国关系的毒箭，企图以此来毒化大会的气氛。他们还伪造了以印度代表团名义散发的关于西藏问题的文件，恶毒地诬蔑中国，破坏中印关系。但是，这些阴谋活动是见不得太阳光的，一经露头，立即遭到了中国和印度代表团严正的揭发而消声匿迹了。帝国主义分子还力图破坏中国和几内亚的友好关系。就在中国杂技团首次在科纳克里为大会代表演出的那天，那些敌视亚非团结的帝国主义分子曾经进行了匿名恐吓的可耻的活动。但是，亚非人民的团结，中国和亚非国家的团结，不是这些妖魔鬼怪所能破坏得了的。尤其是中国人民一贯反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义，并全力支持亚非人民反对殖民主义斗争的坚决立场，早已为一切亚非国家的人民所深深了解，他们把中国看成是自己最可靠的朋友。无论在大会上，在小组会上，或是在同中国代表的接触中，各国代表都以极其友好的态度表示了对中国人民最大的信任和情谊。会场内外，经常可以听到这样的声音：“中国所办到的事，我们也能办到”；也有不少代表说，“中国是我们的榜样”。正如有的代表在会上所讲的：“真理是掩盖不住的”！帝国主义者破坏亚非国家团结的活动，引起了亚非国家的高度警惕。几内亚总统塞古·杜尔和大会主席伊斯梅尔·杜尔都在讲话中，一再强调了这一点。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛说：亚非国家之间的纠纷，都可以通过友好协商来解决。为了我们共同的斗争共同的利益，亚非国家必须团结一致。不能让帝国主义者分裂我们。为此，大会在通过的各项主要决议中，都强调了亚非人民团结的重要性。
    万隆会议精神、开罗会议决议和科纳克里会议的胜利已经牢固地奠定了亚非人民之间磐石般团结的基础。这是任何帝国主义者和一切反动派所破坏不了的。“亚非人民大团结万岁！”是这次会议上最响亮的口号，同时也是把亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争，引向最后胜利的灯塔。让帝国主义和殖民主义者在亚非人民大团结的铁拳底下发抖吧！
