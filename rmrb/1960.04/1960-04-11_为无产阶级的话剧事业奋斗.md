Chairman, fellow committee members:

We have listened to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and have been greatly educated and inspired. Our era is a great era. The Chinese people are working enthusiastically to build socialism and are creating unprecedented miracles in history. Our future is a great future, the communism that working people all over the world yearn for. American imperialism wants to use various disguises to conceal the essence of its imperialist war of aggression and attempts to undermine our peaceful construction. It will receive the lesson it deserves once again from the Chinese people. It should know that no conspiracy can stop the six hundred and fifty million Chinese people from moving forward!

Under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the drama industry has made great leaps forward in the past ten years and continues to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. The drama festival held by the Ministry of Culture in Beijing not long ago once again demonstrated that drama is a powerful tool for quickly reflecting the times and a weapon for publicizing the Party's policies and ideas. This festival is also a harvest of drama workers' study of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, going deep into life, participating in labor training, and constantly carrying out self-transformation and self-revolution. The earth-shaking changes of the times and the transformation of the economic base mean that if our thinking is not transformed and revolutionized, we cannot meet the requirements of the times, we cannot adapt to this economic base, and we cannot even talk about educating the people with socialist and communist ideas. We must treat ideological transformation with a spirit of continuous revolution, and we must not relax our demands for ideological revolution for a moment, otherwise there will be deviations and mistakes in mastering Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. We have a deep understanding of this issue. Chairman Mao creatively combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, enriching the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Striving to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, going deep into the fiery struggles of workers, peasants and soldiers, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, going to factories and mines, participating in labor training, combining with the workers and peasants, constantly carrying out ideological transformation and ideological revolution, and resolutely criticizing modern revisionist thought and bourgeois literary and artistic thought are our current urgent tasks. Only by persisting in continuous ideological revolution can we become proletarian literary and artistic fighters. Only by thoroughly transforming our thinking in the furnace of battle can we shoulder the glorious task assigned to us by the Party and Chairman Mao of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers through literature and art.

In the spring of 1960, a new atmosphere appeared on the capital's drama stage. The characteristic of this performance is that it reflects the contemporary heroic figures with communist qualities created by the great Great Leap Forward era. Many excellent dramas were created collectively by mobilizing the masses. The methods of collective creation by the masses are diverse: some actors went out to visit and collect materials after determining the subject matter, and then wrote separately, and then the director concentrated on it, such as "For Sixty-One Class Brothers"; some were written first by a creative core of two or three people or several people, and then discussed, revised and enriched by the masses, such as "Taming Dragons and Tigers" and "Heroic Train"; some were written by creators and repeatedly discussed and continuously revised and enriched by the masses, or the masses discussed first, determined the outline and then written by one person, such as "Dead Trees Revived" and "Green Pines by the Sea", etc. There are many examples. Despite the variety of practices, the basic issue is to give prominence to politics and launch a mass movement, and correctly implement the Party's policy of three-way combination. Because they liberated their minds and broke superstitions, everyone used their brains, everyone came up with ideas, and they improved the political enthusiasm of the actors and promoted the communist style of daring to think and dare to do. In the past, it was thought that script creation was only a matter for experts and it was very difficult. Although many difficulties were encountered in these creative processes, these creations show that under the leadership of the Party, launching a mass movement can overcome any fortress. In the process of creating the script, the actors more deeply understood the characters in the play, unifying the process of script creation and character creation. At the same time, the process of creating the script and creating the characters is also a process of deeply understanding this great era, and it is a learning process from the new people and new things on various fronts. The actors walked out of the rehearsal room, broadened their horizons, approached advanced figures in all aspects, and learned their noble communist qualities, which is in itself a process of self-transformation. As long as the direction is correct and the actors have a high degree of political enthusiasm, they will not only win time, but also gradually solve the quality problem, because drama is different from film. It may still be a bit rough when it starts performing, but the performance process is still a process of continuous creation. It can absorb the opinions of audiences from all aspects and continue to process and improve it, making it more complete in thought and art and becoming a repertoire. Under the leadership of the Party, launching mass creation is an effective way to quickly respond to the great era and quickly respond to the new people and new things in real life. The mass creation by the masses has enriched the source of dramas, enriched the lives of actors, and improved the thinking of actors. We deeply realize that ideological revolution is the foundation of mass creation, and mass collective creation is an effective way to quickly reflect the new people and new things under the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune. We must continue to carry out ideological revolution and promote the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, and push the mass creation movement of drama to greater development.

How to nationalize and popularize drama also involves liberating thinking. Drama has a revolutionary fighting tradition. Since the beginning of the Chinese drama movement, it has shouldered the fighting task of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, but it is undeniable that it has been deeply influenced by the West for a long time and has always had a foreign flavor. How to solve the shackles of foreign influence and make it suitable for expressing the earth-shaking heroic spirit of the Chinese people today, and suitable for expressing the noble moral character and communist qualities of today's heroes. How to inherit the tradition, discard the old and bring forth the new, and create works that are loved by the broad masses of Chinese people in terms of script structure, directing processing, and actor performance is a problem that our drama circles must solve. The "Taming Dragons and Tigers", "Eastward March", "Locust Tree Village" and "Red Flag Spectrum" and other dramas performed on the capital stage today have all made gratifying gains in the nationalization and popularization issues, and are worthy of our good study and summing up of experience. On this basis, continue to break the superstition of foreign classical dramas, liberate our minds, and critically accept foreign classical literature and dramas. Also, do not merely learn the tricks of opera tradition, but absorb them by melting them. Continue to give play to the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, and strive to create new works of our nationalization and popularization. The great era and the great people's earth-shaking heroic posture and spirit in socialist construction require us to express them with new creative methods. The creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism proposed by Chairman Mao is precisely the creative method suitable for the spirit of this Great Leap Forward era.

The achievements in technical reform on the drama stage in the past ten years were unimaginable in the drama movement of the past few decades. In the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the drama stage technology department has also made many innovations and creations. In order to vividly express the rich and colorful life of our great era, the stage technology department must carry out technical revolution. The "Green Pines by the Sea" performed by the Liaoning People's Art Theater in the capital, with its concise and clear handling, left a deep impression on people, and played a great role in stage technology. The lights cast a beautiful picture of the red sun rising from the East China Sea on the sky, which was very moving. There was also a cannon battle on the stage, and they also made small turntables, etc., using the technology needed to express modern life and highlighting the theme thought. Technology serves politics, and it is to express political and ideological content more clearly and more centrally. Our vigorous and rich real life requires us to express it in the newest and most beautiful form. We must continue to make a big fuss about the stage technology revolution.

Furthermore, in the past ten years, the drama education cause has cultivated a large number of new forces due to the implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and labor production. Including directors, actors and stage art staff. In art education, we must also adhere to the art education revolution and continue to leap forward, and strive to cultivate new forces for the drama cause that are both red and expert!

In short, ideological revolution is the soul of cultural revolution. To become a proletarian literary and artistic fighter, we must carry out continuous revolution on ourselves, thoroughly transform our outlook on life and world outlook, and establish a proletarian world outlook. The times are leaping forward at a rapid pace. We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ahead bravely, and strive for the proletarian drama cause!

    为无产阶级的话剧事业奋斗
    熊佛西　陈其通  孙维世　于　蓝委员的联合发言主席，各位委员：
    我们听了李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，受到很大的教育和鼓舞，我们的时代是伟大的时代，中国人民干劲冲天地在建设社会主义，正在创造史所未有的奇迹。我们的未来是伟大的未来，这就是全世界劳动人民所向往的共产主义。美帝国主义想用各种伪装来掩饰它帝国主义侵略战争的本质，企图破坏我们的和平建设，它将会从中国人民这里再次获得应有的教训，它应该知道，任何阴谋是阻挡不了六亿五千万中国人民向前迈进的步伐！
    在党的领导下，在毛主席“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针指导下，十年来的话剧事业有了突飞猛进的发展，并且在去年大跃进的基础上再继续向前跃进。不久前文化部在北京举办的话剧会演，又一次地说明了话剧是迅速反映时代的有力工具，是宣传党的政策思想的武器。这次会演也正是话剧工作者学习毛主席文艺思想、深入生活、参加劳动锻炼、不断进行自我改造、自我革命的收获。时代翻天复地的变化，经济基础在变革，我们的思想如不改造，不进行革命，就不能符合时代的要求，就不能适应这经济基础，也就更谈不上用社会主义共产主义的思想教育人民，我们要用不断革命的精神对待思想改造，一时一刻也不能放松对思想革命的要求，否则就会在掌握毛主席文艺路线上出偏差，犯错误，在这个问题上我们有深刻的体会。毛主席创造性地将马列主义与中国革命实践相结合，丰富了马列主义的宝库。努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，深入工农兵的火热斗争，上山下乡，到工厂矿区，参加劳动锻炼，同工农群众相结合，不断进行思想改造、思想革命，坚决进行批判现代修正主义思想和资产阶级文艺思想，是我们当前迫切的任务。只有坚持不断地进行思想革命，才能成为无产阶级的文艺战士。只有在战斗的洪炉里彻底改造自己的思想，才能担负起党和毛主席所交给我们的文艺为工农兵服务的光荣任务。
    1960年春天，在首都话剧舞台上出现了一片新气象，这次演出的特点，是反映了伟大的大跃进的时代所创造的具有共产主义品质的当代英雄人物，许多优秀的剧目都是发动群众进行集体创作写出来的，群众集体创作的方法是多种多样的：有的是确定题材后演员纷纷出动，进行访问收集材料，分头执笔然后再由导演集中的，如“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”；有的是先由二三人或数人组织的创作核心执笔，然后由群众讨论修改再加以丰富的，如“降龙伏虎”、“英雄列车”；有的是创作者执笔群众反复讨论不断修改丰富的，或是群众先讨论，确定提纲再由一个人执笔的，如“枯木逢春”，“海边青松”等等，例子很多，尽管作法上多种多样，基本问题是政治挂帅大搞群众运动，正确地执行了党的三结合的方针。由于解放了思想破除了迷信，人人动脑筋，个个想办法，提高了演员的政治热情，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格。过去以为剧本创作是仅仅专家的事情，困难很大，虽然在这些创作过程中也会遇到不少困难，但是通过这些创作说明在党领导下大搞群众运动，没有攻不克的堡垒。演员在创作剧本过程中更深入地体会了剧中人物，把剧本创作和角色创造的过程统一起来，同时创作剧本创造角色的过程也正是深入认识这伟大的时代，是向各个战线上的新人新事的学习过程。演员走出了排演室，扩大了眼界，和各方面的先进人物接近，学习他们高尚的共产主义品质，这本身也是个自我改造的过程。只要方向正确，演员有高度的政治热情，不仅赢得了时间，同时也逐渐会解决了质量问题，因为话剧与电影不同，在开始演出时可能还有些粗糙，但是演出过程仍然是一个继续创造的过程，可以吸收各方面观众的意见，继续加工提高，使其在思想上和艺术上更加趋于完整，成为保留剧目。在党领导下大搞群众创作是迅速反应伟大的时代，迅速反应现实生活中新人新事的有效办法。群众大搞集体创作丰富了剧目来源，丰富了演员的生活，提高了演员的思想。我们深深体会到思想革命是大搞集体创作的基础，群众集体创作是迅速反映总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗下新人新事的有效办法，我们要继续进行思想革命，发扬敢想敢干的精神，把话剧的群众创作运动推向更大的发展。
    话剧如何民族化，如何群众化，也有一个解放思想的问题。话剧有革命的战斗传统，从中国话剧运动开始以来它就担负起反帝反封建的战斗任务，但是不可否认长时期以来它所受西方的影响很深，多少总带些洋味儿。如何解决它所受的外国影响的束缚，使之适合于表现今天中国人民移山倒海的英雄气概，适合于表现今朝英雄的高尚的道德面貌和共产主义品质。从剧本结构、导演处理、演员表演上如何继承传统，推陈出新创造出广大中国人民所喜闻乐见的作品，这是我们话剧界必须解决的问题。今天在首都舞台上演出过的“降龙伏虎”“东进序曲”“槐树庄”“红旗谱”等剧在对民族化群众化的问题上都有了可喜的收获，值得我们很好地去学习和总结经验。在这基础上继续破除对外国古典剧目的迷信，解放思想，对外国古典文学和戏剧要批判地去接受，对戏曲传统也不仅仅是学习它的一招一式，都要溶化的吸收。继续发挥敢想敢干的精神，为勇于创造我们民族化群众化的新作品而努力。伟大的时代，伟大的人民在社会主义建设中排山倒海的雄姿和气概，要求我们用新的创作方法去表现，毛主席提出来的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，正是适合这大跃进的时代精神的创作方法。
    十年来话剧舞台上技术改革方面的成绩是过去几十年话剧运动中所不可能想像的，在这两年的大跃进中，话剧舞台技术部门又有许多革新和创造，要生动地表现我们伟大时代丰富多彩的生活，舞台技术部门必须要进行技术革命。辽宁人艺在首都演出的“海边青松”，简洁鲜明的处理，给人留下很深的印象，在舞台技术方面发挥的作用很大。灯光在天幕上打出了一幅红日出东海的美丽画面非常动人，在舞台上进行了炮战，自己还有制作的小转台等等，使用了表现现代生活所需要的技术，突出了主题思想。技术是为政治服务的，是为了更鲜明更集中地表现政治思想内容。我们蓬勃丰富的现实生活，要求我们用最新最美的形式去表现，我们要继续大闹舞台技术革命。
    再者，十年来戏剧教育事业，由于执行了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和劳动生产相结合的方针培养了大批新生力量。包括了导演、演员和舞台美术人员。我们在艺术教育方面，还要坚持艺术教育革命，继续向前跃进，为培养话剧事业又红又专的新生力量而努力！
    总之，思想革命是文化革命的灵魂，要成为无产阶级的文艺战士，就要对自己进行不断革命，彻底改造自己的人生观和世界观，确立无产阶级的世界观。时代在一日千里的飞跃前进，我们要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进，为无产阶级的话剧事业而奋斗！
