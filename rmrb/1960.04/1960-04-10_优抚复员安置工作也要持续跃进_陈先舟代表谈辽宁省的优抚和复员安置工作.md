Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the final state accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I propose that the congress approve these reports. Now I will make a speech on the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement in Liaoning Province. Please correct any inappropriate points.

In 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the great leap forward in the national economy in 1958, the Chinese people continued to realize a great leap forward in the national economy, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Like all parts of the country, 1959 was also a year of continued great leap forward for Liaoning Province. Great victories were achieved on all fronts. Especially after the campaign against rightist tendencies, to boost morale, and carry out a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, the broad masses were full of spirit and high fighting spirit, and a new situation of a "red start" in 1960, "red every day," and "red every month," and continued leap forward appeared. A magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement is now being carried out. Encouraged by this vigorous and magnificent situation, with the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement also showed a great leap forward.

In the long revolutionary struggle in the past, many revolutionary martyrs contributed their precious lives, many revolutionary soldiers were injured and disabled, a large number of revolutionary soldiers were demobilized and turned to the production and construction posts, and the families of revolutionary soldiers should be cared for and taken care of by the government and the people. The Party and the state have always regarded preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement as an important task.

In recent years, Liaoning region has consistently followed the principles, policies, and instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council regarding preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement work, and has achieved great results. Supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers has become a good traditional habit and social ethos among the people of the province. Preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement work has become a conscious action of the masses. Especially since 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and encouraged and promoted by the great leap forward and the people's commune situation, the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement has been further developed and improved.

First, the work of pensions, preferential treatment, and resettlement for families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers has been strengthened. After the people's communes were established, the living problems of families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled revolutionary soldiers were better resolved. For the few who lacked labor and had difficulties in life, we continued to adopt the method of combining state pensions with mass preferential treatment to ensure that their living standards were not lower than or slightly higher than those of the general public. According to statistics, last year more than 30,000 households of families of revolutionary martyrs and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers in our province enjoyed the preferential labor days or preferential subsidies from the people's communes. More than 5,000 households of lonely and elderly families of revolutionary martyrs and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers with special disabilities and difficulties received regular and quantitative subsidies from the government. Those in cities who had employment conditions were properly arranged for production or work. After resettlement, the actual difficulties that a few people had in production and life were all thoroughly resolved through comprehensive inspections and various measures. In the major inspection last year, the cities of Shenyang and Dalian alone solved more than 30,000 practical problems related to production, life, housing, and marriage for families of revolutionary martyrs and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers.

Second, by deeply carrying out the campaign against rightist tendencies, boosting morale, relying on the strength of the masses, and developing preferential treatment and welfare undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way, the policies of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement were implemented. For demobilized soldiers who are old, alone, and have lost their ability to work, we have adopted the method of providing accommodation and support. Retired military officers have been properly arranged and cared for, and this work is being actively carried out. In order to meet the needs of revolutionary disabled soldiers for installing artificial limbs, in addition to expanding the artificial limb factory, four artificial limb repair stations have been established. For some demobilized soldiers who have suffered from chronic diseases due to long-term arduous revolutionary wars, since the great leap forward, thanks to the concern of party and government leaders at all levels, relying on the broad masses, making use of existing conditions, starting from scratch, 28 sanatoriums for demobilized soldiers with chronic diseases have been established throughout the province, with nearly 2,000 beds. Coupled with on-site outpatient clinics and the communist cooperation carried out by civil affairs departments and municipal and county hospitals, and the establishment of beds in municipal and county hospitals, the number of people treated in 1959 alone reached more than 9,000, effectively helping them restore their health and participate in socialist construction. After the people's communes were established, in order to make the later life of lonely and elderly families of revolutionary martyrs happier, 20 homes for the elderly for families of revolutionary martyrs were established throughout the province, with cities and counties as units. In addition, many people are scattered in the people's commune homes for the elderly, receiving the care they deserve, which fully reflects the meticulous care of the party and the government and the people for them.

Third, every year during festivals, large-scale visits are organized in various places to comfort the troops stationed there and carry out mass preferential treatment work. During the New Year and Spring Festival, people from all walks of life in our province sent comfort groups to the company units, barracks, positions, sentry posts, ships, and airports to comfort all the officers and soldiers stationed in the border defense, coastal defense, and air defense, expressing the concern and love of the people of the motherland for the People's Liberation Army, conveying the great achievements of the great leap forward in socialist construction of the motherland, and thanking the troops for their strong support for local construction, effectively strengthening the relationship between the army and the government and the people, further boosting morale, and inspiring the vast number of officers and soldiers to defend the motherland and build the motherland. For example, when visiting the troops stationed in Dalian, many veterans whose terms of service had expired actively requested to extend their service and continue to stick to their posts to defend the motherland. New recruits also expressed that they would quickly learn their skills and create excellent results in their duties to make contributions to the country and the people. Through consolation and publicity activities, the noble qualities and excellent style of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have had a far-reaching impact on encouraging and educating the broad masses of people.

Fourth, since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of party and government leaders at all levels, focusing on the central task, through various forms of work, the families of martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers were educated and encouraged to inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, and to continuously improve their awareness and play an active role in the socialist cause. From the province, cities, and counties to the people's communes and larger factories and mining enterprises, meetings, representative meetings, oath-taking competitions, and meetings of activists for families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers were generally convened under the direct leadership of the Party Committee to publicize and implement the Party's principles and policies, carry out socialist education, and further mobilize their initiative and creativity through the socialist competition of planting red flags, setting up pacesetters, and learning, comparing, catching up, and helping each other, so that they played a great role in the previous political movements and construction undertakings, and a large number of heroic figures emerged. It is understood that at present, more than 70% of the families of revolutionary martyrs and more than 90% of the demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers in our province have become activists among the masses. Among them, more than 50% of the "five-good" demobilized soldiers have been achieved. For example, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party Committee of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, 170 of the 172 demobilized and transferred soldiers have won the honorary titles of advanced producers, advanced workers, red banner bearers, and high-production experts. The 232 demobilized and transferred soldiers of the Benxi Alloy Factory put forward more than 2,300 technical innovation proposals last year, which played a certain role in promoting the factory to complete its annual production plan ahead of schedule. In the rural areas of Gaiping County, the demobilized soldiers of more than 100 production brigades were rated as "full house red" units. Gao Zhihe, a demobilized soldier of Songshan Brigade of Zhonggu People's Commune in Kaiyuan County, created a high yield record of 3,046 jin per mu of rice in the high-yield field movement. In short, their advanced deeds in socialist construction are too numerous to mention. In addition, the active role of demobilized soldiers is also prominently manifested in the construction of the militia. Because they have received strict military training in the army, they have maintained and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army after returning to their localities, and many people have become the backbone of the militia organization. According to incomplete statistics from several cities such as Shenyang and Dalian alone, there are more than 60,000 demobilized soldiers serving as militia cadres, which plays an active role in the consolidation and development of our people's communes that combine workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and integrate government and society.

In addition, the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is promoted to the broad masses of the people through preferential treatment and resettlement work. Since the Great Leap Forward, many gray-haired families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled and weak demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers have also tried their best to contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland, demonstrating the tenacious revolutionary spirit of having a share of heat and emitting a share of light. Many comrades who are recuperating in honor are originally supported by the state for life, but they are not content with being supported and actively participate in labor they can do, and also form a performance team to sing about the great victories of Chairman Mao, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes everywhere. They have performed more than 140 performances in various parts of the province, with more than 170,000 audiences. Everyone who has seen their performance feels that they have taken a vivid communist class. Li Shaokui, a national special-class labor model in Anshan City, said after watching the performance that on behalf of the workers of Angang, he must use the over-fulfillment of the steelmaking tasks assigned by the Party to answer the performance of the comrades who are recuperating. At the same time, the establishment of martyrs' monuments and mausoleums, as well as the collection and publicity of the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs and the praise of martyrs, have also played a significant role in educating the people, especially the younger generation. For example, the heroic deeds of An Yemin, a communist fighter known throughout the country, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the newspaper, radio station, the Communist Youth League and other relevant departments jointly cooperated to organize report meetings and speeches, and more than 1.3 million copies of pamphlets on An Yemin's heroic deeds were distributed. After the extensive and in-depth publicity of Comrade An Yemin's lofty communist ideas and glorious image, it has become a force to educate and encourage people to move forward.

The great achievements of the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement vividly reflect the great victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and also repeatedly prove the correctness of the Party's principles and policies for the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement. Years of work practice, especially the work since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, have made us realize that in order to do a good job in the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement, we must:

1. Closely rely on the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all work. Practice has proved that the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement must adhere to this truth in order to be done well. The work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement is related to national defense construction and national economic construction. Doing this work well plays a certain role in boosting morale, consolidating national defense, and promoting the development of productive forces. It is precisely based on such an important significance that the Party has formulated the policies of preferential treatment and resettlement. Experience has proved that by closely relying on the leadership of the Party and resolutely implementing the Party's general line and various policies, we will surely achieve great achievements in our work. In 1959, due to our earnest implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, firmly opposing rightist tendencies and greatly boosting morale, we overcame the rightist thinking of some cadres who believed that the practical problems in the work of preferential treatment and resettlement could not be solved in a short time. With politics in command, we adopted the method of relying on the Party Committee, boldly mobilizing the masses, and implementing the principle of combining large, medium, and small, and building hospitals by the province, cities, and counties to solve the practical problems in the work, especially the problem of the treatment of chronic diseases of demobilized soldiers that had not been well solved in recent years. This is a good proof.

2. Vigorously launch mass movements and carry out communist cooperation. The reason why the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement in our province in 1959 made a leap forward was the result of the active support, strong cooperation, vigorous mass movement, and mass inspection and comparison under the leadership of the Party. The wisdom of the masses is infinite, and once the masses are mobilized, all difficulties will be solved easily. For example, in the second half of last year, according to the instructions of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, a mass red flag competition movement of inspection, comparison, and cooperation for the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement was launched throughout the province, breaking through the boundaries of units and systems, and carrying out mutual inspections and comparisons between cities and counties, factories and mines, and people's communes, not only achieving mutual exchange of resources, exchanging experiences, and making progress together, but also more thoroughly solving many problems that should be solved, deeply implementing the Party's policies of preferential treatment and resettlement, and stimulating the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people to care for the families of revolutionary martyrs and demobilized and rehabilitated soldiers, laying the foundation for further improvement of the work of preferential treatment and resettlement.

3. Closely combine the Party's central work and political movements to arrange the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement. Political and ideological education should be conducted for families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers through symposiums, representative meetings, oath-taking rallies, and other methods; and they should be promoted to study political theory, especially the works and culture of Chairman Mao, to improve their socialist awareness. Promote them to actively participate in the socialist competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, and play an active backbone role in their respective posts. Experience has proved that only in this way can the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement be closely combined with the central work, better serve the central tasks, and at the same time ensure that the work of preferential treatment, rehabilitation, and resettlement continues to leap forward.

At present, under the correct leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the wise Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are holding high the great banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and are carrying out a vigorous technical innovation, technical revolution, and study of Chairman Mao's works movement with a momentum of breaking through bamboo. This is a great situation of double leap forward in political thought and science and technology. Under this victorious situation of continuous leap forward, we are determined to lead under the victorious banner of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, rely on the strength of the broad masses of the people, and strive to achieve the continuous leap forward of the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents and the work of preferential treatment and resettlement in our province!

    优抚复员安置工作也要持续跃进
    陈先舟代表谈辽宁省的优抚和复员安置工作主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，建议大会通过批准这些报告。现在我就辽宁省的优抚和复员安置工作做一发言，不当之处请予指正。
    1959年，我国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在1958年国民经济大跃进的基础上，又继续实现了国民经济大跃进，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。辽宁省和全国各地一样，1959年也是继续大跃进的一年。各个战线上都取得了巨大的胜利。特别是在反右倾、鼓干劲、开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动以后，广大群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，出现了1960年开门红、日日红、月月红，继续跃进的新局面。现在正开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，在这种声势磅礴、气象万千的大好形势鼓舞下，随着工农业生产的高速度发展，优抚和复员安置工作也出现了一个大跃进的局面。
    我们国家，在过去长期的革命斗争中，许多革命先烈贡献了他们的宝贵生命，不少革命军人受伤致残，大批革命军人复员转向生产建设岗位，革命军人家属应当受到政府和人民的关怀和照顾。党和国家一向是把优抚和复员安置工作作为一项重要工作。
    几年来，辽宁地区一贯遵循着党中央、国务院关于优抚和复员安置工作的方针政策和指示进行工作的，取得了很大成绩，拥军优属在全省人民中已经形成一种优良的传统习惯和社会风尚。优抚和复员安置工作已成为群众的自觉行动。特别是1958年以来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社形势的鼓舞推动下，优抚和复员安置工作又有了新的发展和提高。
    首先，是加强了对烈军属荣复军人的抚恤、优待和安置工作。人民公社化以后，烈军属和革命残废军人的生活问题得到了更好的解决。对少数缺乏劳动力生活还有困难的，我们继续采取了国家抚恤和群众优待相结合的办法，保证了他们生活不低于或稍高于一般群众的生活水平。据统计，去年我省有三万多户烈属和荣复军人享受了人民公社的优待劳动日或优待金的照顾，有五千多户孤老烈属和有特残困难的荣复军人得到了政府的定期定量补助。在城市中有就业条件的均已妥善地安排了生产或工作。在安置以后，少数人在生产、生活上存在的实际困难，都通过全面检查，分别采取了许多措施，得到了比较彻底地解决。仅沈阳、旅大两市在去年大检查中，为烈军属荣复军人解决有关生产、生活、住房和婚姻等各种实际问题即达三万余件。
    其次，是深入反右倾鼓干劲，依靠群众力量，多快好省地发展优抚福利事业，贯彻执行了优抚、复员安置的政策。对年老失去劳动能力的独身复员军人，我们采取了收容供养的办法。对退休军官已作了妥善安排和照顾，并正在积极开展这项工作。为满足革命残废军人安装假肢的需要，除扩充假肢工厂外，又建立了四处假肢修配站。对于部分复员军人，由于过去长期艰苦的革命战争积劳成疾的人们，大跃进以来，由于各级党政领导的关怀，依靠广大群众、因陋就简、白手起家，在全省办起二十八所慢性病复员军人疗养院，近二千张床位，加上就地门诊以及民政部门和市县医院开展共产主义大协作，在市、县医院内附设床位等办法治疗，仅1959年治疗人数即达九千余人，有效地帮助他们恢复了健康，参加了社会主义建设。人民公社化以后，为使孤老烈属的晚年生活更加幸福，全省各地以市县为单位办起了二十处烈属养老院，另外还有许多人分散在人民公社敬老院内，受到了应有的敬养，这都充分体现了党和政府以及人民群众对他们无微不至的关怀。
    复次，是每逢年节各地都组织较大规模的慰问驻军和开展群众性的优属工作在新年春节期间，我省各界人民派出了慰问团深入连队、营房、阵地、哨所、舰艇、机场，慰问驻守边防、海防和空防的所有驻军官兵，表达祖国人民对解放军的关怀和爱戴，传达祖国社会主义建设大跃进的伟大成就，并感谢部队对地方建设的大力支援，有效地密切了军政民关系，进一步鼓舞了士气，更加激发了广大官兵保卫祖国、建设祖国的斗志和决心。例如在慰问旅大驻军时，许多服役期满的老战士积极要求超期服役，继续坚守在保卫祖国的岗位上，刚刚入伍的新兵也表示迅速学好本领，在值勤中创造优异成绩为国家和人民建树功勋。中国人民解放军的高贵品质和优良作风，通过慰问和宣传活动，对鼓舞和教育广大群众产生了深远的影响。
    再次，是大跃进以来，在各级党政领导下，围绕中心任务，通过各种工作形式，教育和鼓励烈军属荣复军人，继承和发扬革命光荣传统，不断提高觉悟，在社会主义事业中发挥积极作用。从省市县直到人民公社和较大的厂矿企业单位均根据中心任务的需要，在党委直接领导下，普遍地召开了烈军属荣复军人座谈会、代表会、誓师比武会、积极分子会等，宣传贯彻党的方针政策，进行社会主义教育，通过层层插红旗、树标兵、开展学、比、赶、帮的社会主义竞赛，进一步调动了他们的积极性创造性，使他们在历次政治运动中和各项建设事业中起到了很大作用，并涌现出大批的英雄人物。据了解，目前我省有70％以上的烈军属和90％以上的荣复军人已成为群众中的积极分子。其中“五好”复员军人已达到50％以上。比如沈阳市水泵厂的一百七十二名复员转业军人，在该厂党委的领导培养下，已有一百七十人荣获先进生产者、先进工作者、红旗手和高产能手的荣誉称号。本溪市合金厂的二百三十二名复员转业军人，去年提出技术革新倡议二千三百多件，对推动该厂提前完成全年生产计划起到了一定作用。盖平县农村有一百多个生产大队的复员军人被评为满堂红单位。开原县中固人民公社嵩山大队复员军人高治和在高产田运动中创造了水稻亩产三千零四十六斤的高产纪录。总之，他们在社会主义建设中的先进事例是不胜枚举。另外，复员军人的积极作用还突出的表现在民兵建设上，由于他们在部队中受过严格的军事训练，回到地方后保持和发扬了解放军的优良传统，许多人成为民兵组织中的骨干。仅沈阳、旅大等几个市不完全统计，即有六万余复员军人担任民兵干部，这对我们工农商学兵相结合、政社合一的人民公社的巩固和发展起着积极作用。
    此外，通过优抚复员安置工作来号召广大人民群众，学习中国人民解放军的光荣革命传统。大跃进以来，许多白发苍苍的烈属和身残体弱的荣复军人，也千方百计地为祖国社会主义建设事业贡献自己力量，表现了有一分热、发一分光的顽强革命精神。许多荣军休养员同志本来是国家供养终身的，但他们不安于供养生活，主动参加力能胜任的劳动，还组成一支演出队，到处歌唱毛主席、总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利。他们先后在省内各地演出一百四十多场，观众达十七万人。看过他们演出的人，无不感到上了一次生动的共产主义课。鞍山市全国特等劳模李绍奎同志看过演出后，代表鞍钢职工表示：一定用超额完成党交给的炼钢任务，来回答休养员同志们的演出。同时通过建立烈士碑塔陵园，以及搜集和宣传革命先烈的英雄事迹和褒扬烈士，对教育人民群众特别是青年一代，也起到了重大作用。例如闻名全国的共产主义战士安业民的英雄业绩，在党委领导下，报社、电台、青年团等有关部门共同配合，组织报告会讲演会，仅发行安业民英雄事迹的小册子即达一百三十多万份。经过广泛深入地宣传安业民同志崇高的共产主义思想和光荣形象，已成为教育和鼓舞人们前进的力量。
    优抚和复员安置工作的巨大成绩，生动地反映了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，同时也一再证明了党的优抚复员安置工作的方针政策的正确。多年来的工作实践，特别是1958年大跃进以来的工作情况，使我们体会到要想做好优抚复员安置工作必须：
    一、紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。党的领导是一切工作胜利的根本保证。实践证明，优抚复员安置工作必须坚守这一真理才能做好。优抚复员安置工作既关系到国防建设，又关系到国家经济建设，做好这一工作，对鼓舞士气，巩固国防，以及促进生产力的发展起着一定作用。党正是根据这样重要意义才制定了优抚和复员安置的政策。经验证明：紧紧依靠党的领导，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和党的各项方针政策，我们工作就一定能取得伟大成就。1959年由于我们认真贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会决议，狠反右倾，大鼓干劲，克服了某些干部认为优抚复员工作中的实际问题不能一时解决的右倾思想，政治挂了帅，对工作中的实际问题，特别是几年来未很好解决的复员军人慢性病治疗问题，采取依靠党委，放手发动群众，贯彻执行了大中小结合的方针，省市县分别建院等办法，使全省的复员军人疾病治疗问题基本上解决了，这就是很好的证明。
    二、大搞群众运动，展开共产主义大协作。1959年我省的优抚复员安置工作之所以跃进，就是在党的领导下，有关部门积极支援、大力协作和大搞群众运动，大搞群众性的检查评比的结果。群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，群众一经发动起来之后，一切困难都会迎刃而解。例如去年下半年，根据中共辽宁省委指示，在全省范围内，开展了一次群众性的优抚复员安置工作大检查、大评比、大协作的红旗竞赛运动，突破了本单位、本系统的界限，展开了市县间、厂矿间、人民公社间的互相检查评比，不仅做到了互通有无，交流经验，共同跃进，同时还比较彻底地解决了许多应该解决的问题，深入地贯彻了党的优抚复员安置政策，激发了广大干部和群众关心烈军属荣复军人的政治热情，为进一步做好优抚复员工作打下了基础。
    三、密切结合党的中心工作和政治运动来安排优抚复员安置工作。通过座谈会、代表会、誓师比武大会和其他方法，对烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人进行政治思想教育；并推动他们认真学习政治理论，特别是毛主席的著作和文化，提高他们社会主义觉悟。推动他们积极投入学、比、赶、帮的社会主义竞赛运动，在自己的岗位上发挥了积极骨干作用。经验证明：只有这样，才能使优抚复员安置工作与中心工作密切结合，更好地为中心任务服务，同时也能保证优抚复员安置工作继续跃进。
    目前我国人民在伟大的中国共产党和英明的毛主席的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大旗帜，正以破竹之势，开展轰轰烈烈的技术革新、技术革命和学习毛主席著作运动，这是政治思想和科学技术双跃进的大好形势。在这种持续跃进的胜利形势下，我们有决心在党和毛主席思想胜利旗帜的领导下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，依靠广大群众的力量，为实现我省拥军优属和优抚复员安置工作的持续跃进而奋斗！
