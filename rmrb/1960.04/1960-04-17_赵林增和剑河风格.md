    Zhao Linzeng and the Jianhe Style
    By our reporter Xiao Ming
    Before even arriving in Jianhe, I heard many comrades who had been there discussing the "Jianhe cadre style." Responsible comrades of the CPC Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture Committee also introduced the "Jianhe cadre style" to reporters. They believed that the reason Jianhe County, during the Great Leap Forward, leaped from being one of the most backward areas to the forefront of the province, becoming one of the province's red banner counties, was precisely the great power of this style. When the reporter arrived in Jianhe, I quickly sensed an unusually active atmosphere. After further in-depth understanding, I realized the reason why people were so enthusiastically discussing the "Jianhe cadre style."
    The most appropriate synonym for "Jianhe cadre style" is the Great Leap Forward style. This style has been visible everywhere since 1958, but in Jianhe it appears particularly clear, vivid, and concrete. It demonstrates the spiritual outlook of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the heroic spirit of humbly learning and bravely advancing in the face of new things.
    The Jianhe County Committee, when discussing their work, began with studying Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological methods. Jianhe cadres particularly emphasized Chairman Mao's instruction to "learn by doing, doing is learning." Furthermore, they creatively applied it to all fields, ensuring that they understood what they were doing and learned what they were promoting. In this regard, Comrade Zhao Linzeng, the secretary of the Jianhe County Committee, is a model for all cadres in the county. The cadres and masses of Jianhe County praised "Secretary Zhao as a capable person." Comrade Zhao Linzeng came from a poor peasant background, so it's not surprising that he is familiar with farming. People call him a capable person not just for this, but also for the various new technologies and experiences in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry, which have been vigorously developed by the people's communes. These skills cannot be learned in a day. Comrade Zhao Linzeng does what he learns, and learns while engaging in construction. He humbly learns and personally participates in new things, enriching and improving himself in the process, while also enriching and improving all the cadres in the county step by step.
    Jianhe County was originally a culturally and technologically backward area. Cadres and the masses were unfamiliar with many new experiences and technologies, and even some technical cadres often couldn't pass the technical barriers. Comrade Zhao Linzeng not only participated personally, but was often the first to break through the technical barriers. To advance the season and take the initiative in agriculture, he spent five or six days and nights, being the first in the county to overcome the hurdle of hotbed seedling cultivation. The county committee planned to mobilize the masses to vigorously develop local fertilizer production. Several technical cadres in the county had long been unable to overcome the technical hurdle of producing solid nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer. Comrade Zhao Linzeng, along with Zhou Deyu, the head of the Industrial Section of the County People's Committee, Zheng Bingqi of the Scientific Research Institute, and other comrades, successfully produced the first batch of solid nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer in the county in the courtyard of the county committee. During last year's "small autumn harvest" campaign, Jianhe County collected more than 700 million catties of wild plants. In order to organize a county-wide processing campaign, Comrade Zhao Linzeng and the cadres of the county committee also set up stoves in the county committee courtyard and refined the first pot of tannin extract in the county. Last winter, the mass processing campaign of one pot per household and one factory for every three households, which was launched in Jianhe County, started from here.
    Comrade Zhao Linzeng also used the method of "meetings with demonstrations, everything with on-site examples" to make all the cadres in the county experts in various aspects of production. The county committee's courtyard became a technology transfer station. Each meeting always included a demonstration of advanced experience, teaching techniques to the cadres. When the Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for vigorously developing animal husbandry with pigs as the leader, Comrade Zhao Linzeng and the county's technical cadres taught the county-level cadres various techniques related to animal husbandry production in the county committee courtyard while learning themselves. For new creations among the masses, Comrade Zhao Linzeng often personally summarized them and convened on-site meetings to promote them throughout the county. One of the important technical measures that made Jianhe County a thousand-catty rice county – fire-smoked fertilizer – was personally summarized and organized for promotion by Comrade Zhao Linzeng. In early 1958, Jianhe learned the method of burning and composting from Jiangkou County. Not long after, Shi Lianyuan, the secretary of the Panxi District Committee, called Comrade Zhao Linzeng, saying that Nanming Township had improved the composting method, creating "universal fertilizer" with very good results. Although he asked in detail on the phone at the time, he didn't fully understand the method of "universal fertilizer" over the phone. Nanming was 140 li from the county, and he rushed to Nanming the next day to see how "universal fertilizer" was made. After his visit, he felt that this method was better than composting. Upon returning to the county, he immediately gathered the county-level cadres and convened an on-site learning meeting. After the meeting in the morning, most of the county cadres went to various communes in the afternoon to spread the advanced experience. Later, Jianhe County named this method fire-smoked fertilizer. As a result of the county-wide promotion, fire-smoked fertilizer can enhance soil fertility, providing the land with sufficient base fertilizer. It has a good effect on improving soil, a positive effect on nurturing forests, and a significant effect on killing mosquitoes and pests. In the past, Jianhe County was the area with the most serious pests due to its high mountains and deep grass. Since the widespread promotion of fire-smoked fertilizer in 1959, no pests have been found in other areas of the county except for a few management areas where rice gall midge and stem borers have been discovered. No wonder people say that fire-smoked fertilizer is one of the clever strategies for Jianhe to become a thousand-catty rice county.
    Comrade Zhao Linzeng always maintained an attitude of "the more difficult the work, the more we must learn" towards the study of the Party's policies, theories, and production technologies. Therefore, he is not only a good leading cadre who correctly implements the Party's guidelines and policies, but also a lively, versatile organizer and leader of production. On water conservancy construction sites, he helps measure horizontal lines, survey terrain, load explosives, and conduct blasting. In the fields, he can test soil, cultivate seedlings, treat various pests and diseases, and also make local fertilizers and local pesticides. At the animal husbandry farms, he can raise livestock, breed them, understand veterinary medicine, and also give pigs injections, treat diseases, cut thyroid glands, fatten them, etc... He is truly an all-purpose technical instructor. Comrade Zhao Linzeng's ideological style of understanding what he is doing and learning what he is promoting has become a new style that cadres throughout the county are vying to learn.
    Under the influence of Comrade Zhao Linzeng, the cadres of Jianhe County have also become active participants in the technical innovation movement and in labor. Last year, the average amount of labor performed by cadres above the level of full-time branch secretary was 288 workdays per person, with many cadres matching the strong labor force among the commune members. For example, Li Zhifu, the deputy secretary of the general branch of the Paiyang Management District, worked 280 workdays in a year and also did an excellent job. From Comrade Zhao Linzeng to every staff member, the cadres of the county committee are all labor experts. They can all eat, live, and work with the masses. In 1959, the production income of the county-level cadres exceeded one and a half times their own due wages. They created a large amount of wealth for the country. In addition to self-sufficiency, the vegetables grown by the county committee also supplied other places. In addition to solving the meat consumption of the cadres, the pigs they raised were also transferred to the state in the form of hundreds of large fat pigs. In the county seat, no matter which agency you go to, the office is connected to the production site. In the courtyard of the agency, next to the grain warehouse, there are processing wild plants with tannin extraction, starch making, mixed oil refining, and other pots and machines. Last year, three technicians from Shanghai who planted medicinal materials came to Jianhe County to help cultivate medicinal materials. They planned to cultivate 30 mu of medicinal materials near the county seat and asked the county committee to mobilize a part of the masses to assist. Comrade Zhao Linzeng smiled and said, "There is no need to mobilize the masses, we can do it ourselves." Sure enough, starting the next day, all the county-level cadres went out to work. They prepared the land in one day and planted in one day, completing everything according to quality and quantity in just two days.
    In 1959, Zhao Linzeng and the cadres of Jianhe County, through their own example, led the people of Jianhe County in a heroic struggle against nature. In that year, Jianhe achieved the title of thousand-catty rice county, a bumper harvest of mountain products, and transformed from a poor county into a rich county. With the lofty ambitions and soaring enthusiasm of the cadres and masses throughout the county, the land of Jianhe County has also become more beautiful, lovely, and radiant. The high mountains and ridges, which were originally cursed as places where "people take off their hats and horses leave their saddles," have now become a treasure trove of wealth. Although the mountain and forest products worth more than 30 million yuan were collected in 1959, this number is less than 20% of the mountain and forest products. This year, they have already formulated a continued leap forward plan for the collection of mountain goods. The leap forward plans for grain, as well as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, industry, etc., have all been implemented to the production units. In order to successfully achieve the leap forward goals, the cadres and the broad masses of Jianhe County are continuing to fight against nature. Now, they have invested in the technical innovation movement, determined to completely change the face of the mountainous areas, and to take out more materials to support national industrialization, continue to strive for the upstream in socialist construction, and continue to insert the red flag.

    赵林增和剑河风格
    本报记者　萧明
    未到剑河以前，就听到许多到过剑河的同志议论“剑河干部风格”，中共黔东南苗族侗族自治州委负责同志，也向记者介绍“剑河干部风格”。并且认为剑河县在大跃进中，所以从一个最落后的地区，跃居全省之首，成为全省的红旗县之一，正是这风格的伟大力量。当记者来到剑河时，很快感到周围有一种异乎寻常的活跃的气氛。再作深入一点了解，就体会到人们那么热情的议论“剑河干部风格”的原因。
    “剑河干部风格”的最恰当的同义语，就是大跃进风格。这风格自从1958年以来，是随处可看到的，不过在剑河则显得分外鲜明、生动和具体。它表现出由毛泽东思想武装起来的人们的精神面貌，和在新事物面前虚心学习以及藐视困难的勇往直前的英雄气概。
    剑河县委在谈他们工作时首先是从学习毛泽东同志的思想方法开始的。剑河干部特别重视毛主席的“干起来再学习，干就是学习”的指示。并且，把它创造性地运用到一切领域中，做到了作什么就要懂什么，推广什么就得先学会什么。在这方面，剑河县委书记赵林增同志，是全县干部的榜样，剑河县的干部和群众都夸奖“赵书记是个能人”。赵林增同志是贫农出身，他熟悉种庄稼这不奇怪。人们说他是能人，还不是指的这一方面，而是指的人民公社大力发展的农、林、牧、副、渔、工各业中的各种新技术新经验。这些本领，不是一日所能学会的。赵林增同志干什么、学什么，一边搞建设，一边学习搞建设，在新事物面前虚心学习、亲自动手，在干的过程中把自己充实和提高起来，同时也把全县干部一步步充实和提高起来。
    剑河县原是个文化技术落后的地区，干部和群众对许多新经验新技术都很生疏，一些技术干部，也常常过不了技术关。赵林增同志不仅亲手干，而且常常是第一个闯过技术关。为提早季节，在农业上打主动仗，他曾花了五、六个白天和黑夜，第一个过了全县温床育苗关。县委计划发动群众大搞土化肥，县里几个技术干部，很长时间没过了制固氮菌肥技术关，赵林增同志就与县人委工业科长周德玉、科学研究所的郑炳奇等几位同志在县委院子里试制成全县第一批固氮菌肥。在去年的“小秋收”运动中，剑河县收集了七亿多斤野生植物，为了组织全县加工运动，赵林增同志与县委机关干部，也在县委院子搭起炉灶，炼出了全县第一锅栲胶。去年冬季，在剑河县开展起来的一户一锅、三户一厂的群众加工运动，就是从这里开始的。
    赵林增同志又运用“会会有表演，事事有现场”的办法，使全县所有干部都成为各项生产中的内行。县委机关院子成了技术传授站，每一次开会，总有推广先进经验的现场，向干部传授技术。当中央和毛主席号召以猪为首大力发展畜牧业生产时，赵林增同志和县上的技术干部在县委院子里一边自己学，一边教给县级机关干部关于畜牧业生产上的各种技术。对群众中的新创造，赵林增同志常是亲自总结，召开现场会议在全县推广。使剑河县成为水稻千斤县的重要技术措施——火熏肥，就是赵林增同志亲自总结组织推广的。1958年初，剑河从江口县学来火烧堆肥办法。不久以后，磻溪区区委书记石连元同志打电话给赵林增同志，说南明乡改进了堆肥办法，搞“普遍肥”，效果很好。当时，他在电话上虽然问得很详细，但在电话里对“普遍肥”的搞法没有闹清楚。南明离县一百四十里，他第二天一天赶到南明，去看“普遍肥”的搞法。他参观以后，觉得这办法比堆肥好。回到县里，立即把县级机关干部集合起来，召开现场学习会议。上午开了会，下午大部分县干部就到各公社去传播先进经验去了。后来剑河县给这个办法起名为火熏肥。全县推广的结果，火熏肥能增强地力，使土地有充足的底肥。对改良土壤有很好的效果，对抚育山林有积极作用，对灭蚊和灭病虫害也有显著效果。过去剑河县因为山高草深，是病虫害最严重的地区。自1959年普遍推广火熏肥以后，全县除几个管理区发现过稻包虫和钻心虫以外，其他地区都没有发现病虫害。难怪人们说火熏肥是剑河争得水稻千斤县妙策之一。
    赵林增同志对待党的政策理论和生产技术的学习，始终抱着“工作越困难越要学习”的态度。因此他不仅是正确贯彻执行党的方针政策的好的领导干部，又是个生动活泼、多才多艺的生产的组织者和领导者。在水利工地上，他帮助测量水平线，察勘地形，装炸药，搞爆破。在田里他会化验土壤，会育苗，会治各种病虫害，还会制造土化肥、土农药。到畜牧场他会饲养牲畜，会配种，懂兽医，还会给猪扎针治病、割甲状腺、育肥等等……他真是个万能的技术指导员。赵林增同志这种做什么懂什么，提倡什么先学会什么的思想作风，已经成为全县干部竞相学习的崭新风格。
    在赵林增同志的影响下，剑河县的干部在技术革新运动中和劳动中，也都成了积极分子。脱产支部书记以上的干部，去年一年的劳动量，平均每人达二百八十八个劳动日，有不少干部都顶上社员中的强劳动力，像排洋管理区的总支副书记李之福，一年作了二百八十个劳动日，工作还作得很出色。县委机关干部，从赵林增同志到每一个干事，都是劳动能手。他们都能与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。1959年县级机关干部的生产收入，超过自己应得工资的一倍半。他们给国家创造了大量财富。县机关种的菜除自给以外，还供应外地，他们喂的猪，除解决机关干部的肉食外，还上调给国家上百头大肥猪。在县城里，无论走到哪个机关，都是办公室与生产场地相连，机关院子里，粮食仓库的旁边，都林立着炼栲胶，制淀粉，炼混合油等加工野生植物的锅灶和机器。去年上海有三位种植药材的技术人员，到剑河县来帮助培育药材，计划在县城附近培育三十亩药材，要求县委动员一部分群众协助，赵林增同志笑了笑说：“用不着动员群众，我们自己就行。”果然，从第二天开始，县级机关干部全体出动，一天整地，一天栽种，仅用两天的时间，就全部按质按量的完成了。
    1959年，赵林增和剑河县的干部们，以身作则的领导剑河县人民向大自然进行了英勇的斗争。这一年，剑河获得了水稻千斤县，山货大丰收，由穷县变成了富县。剑河县这块土地，随着全县干部群众的雄心大志，冲天干劲，也变得更加美丽可爱，光芒四射。原被人们咒诅为“人走脱帽，马走离鞍”的高山大岭，现在成了财富的宝库。1959年虽然收集了价值三千余万元的山林产品，而这个数目，还不及山林产品的20％。今年他们已订了山货搜集的继续跃进计划。粮食以及林、牧、副、渔、工业等的跃进计划都已落实到生产单位。为胜利达到跃进目标，剑河县干部和广大群众，正继续向大自然进行着斗争。现在，他们已投入技术革新运动，决心彻底改变山区面貌，要拿出更多的物资支援国家工业化，在社会主义建设中继续争上游，继续插红旗。（附图片）
