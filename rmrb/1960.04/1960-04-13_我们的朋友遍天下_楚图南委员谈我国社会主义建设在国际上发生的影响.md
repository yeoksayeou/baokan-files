    Our Friends are All Over the World
    NPC Member Chu Tunan Discusses the International Impact of China's Socialist Construction

    Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial accounts and the draft 1960 national budget. These two reports provide a Marxist-Leninist analysis and summary of the great achievements made in China's national economic construction in 1959, and make realistic, reasonable, meticulous and detailed arrangements for the development of the national economy in 1960. This fully embodies Chairman Mao Zedong's policy thinking of integrating the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and unfolds a magnificent picture for the continued leap forward in 1960. It will surely inspire the people of all nationalities in our country to continue to struggle, under the glorious illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap, and the People's Communes, along the road pointed out by Chairman Mao, with a Great Leap Forward spirit, to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national construction plan ahead of schedule!

    I also fully agree with Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report, "Strive to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule." Based on the general spirit of this report and all the measures deployed, we have full confidence that, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, with soaring enthusiasm, will surely be able to complete this great and glorious task, so that our country's rural areas will achieve greater development and a more beautiful and magnificent new socialist rural landscape will emerge.

    In international affairs, China also achieved great success in 1959. Especially during the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, leading figures and outstanding people from eighty-seven countries around the world gathered in Beijing to celebrate the National Day with the Chinese people and warmly praised China's construction achievements over the past ten years. Over the past decade, there have been friendly exchanges and cultural ties between China and more than 120 countries and regions around the world. This demonstrates the unprecedented improvement of China's international status and that the Chinese people have friends all over the world. It also shows that the great victory of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction has an increasingly broad and profound impact internationally.

    Precisely for this reason, even with the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave stirred up by American imperialism and a handful of reactionaries in the Southeast Asian region since last year, China's friendly relations with Asian and African countries have still made great progress. For example, not long ago, China signed agreements with Burma and Nepal respectively on the border issues between the two countries, signed a treaty of friendship and mutual non-aggression with Burma, and signed an economic assistance agreement between the two countries with Nepal. This not only brought China's friendly relations with Burma and Nepal to a new stage, but also set a new example for friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence among Asian and African countries. Another example is that the agricultural exhibition exhibited by China in India not long ago and the industrial and agricultural exhibition currently being exhibited in East Pakistan have been warmly welcomed by the local people. The Chinese cultural friendship delegation and the national song and dance troupe it led were invited to visit and perform in Burma, and were warmly received by the Government of the Union of Burma and warmly welcomed by the Burmese people. These are all victories for China's peaceful diplomacy and good-neighborly policy, and also victories for China's unwavering adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference in developing friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African nationalist countries. Because the People's Republic of China is a socialist country, this determines that our country's foreign policy is to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, support the national democratic movements of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and establish and develop friendly relations with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. The peoples of Asian and African countries have roughly the same historical experience in the past, having suffered the unfortunate experience of being invaded and exploited by imperialism, and today they have the common goals of striving for and safeguarding national independence, opposing imperialist rule and plunder, striving to change their own backwardness, and building their respective prosperous and strong motherlands. This requires Asian and African countries to unite and cooperate with each other on the basis of the Five Principles to seek common prosperity and development. This is where the common fundamental interests of Asian and African countries lie, and also where the great vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit lies. Therefore, it is natural that the peoples of Asian and African countries have friendly wishes towards the revolutionary and victorious Chinese people, towards the Chinese people who resolutely implement a peaceful foreign policy and coexist peacefully with countries with different social systems based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and it is also perfectly understandable that the Chinese people sympathize with and support them.

    Because imperialism and a handful of reactionaries fear the rise and growth of the power of the people, they try every possible means to sabotage and split the power of the peoples of Asian and African countries, sow discord, and fabricate all kinds of rumors about the Five Principles and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, attempting to spread discord among Asian and African countries, especially stirring up an anti-China and anti-Chinese wave. However, far-sighted politicians in Asian and African countries, especially the awakened peoples of Asian and African countries, will eventually see through any despicable tricks and conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries. The signing of the above-mentioned Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese treaties and agreements and the new development of friendly relations between China and Burma and China and Nepal, as well as the friendship of the broad masses of the Indian and Pakistani peoples towards the Chinese people, not only reflect and display the common demands and common wishes of the Asian and African peoples, but also show that the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit are still the criteria guiding Asian and African countries in handling international affairs and developing friendly relations between countries. China's unwavering adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit in resolving historical issues with Asian countries has set a good example for the friendly unity of Asian and African countries. This is another most serious blow to imperialism and reactionaries. At the same time, it has opened up broad and brilliant roads for Asian and African countries to develop new relations of peaceful coexistence, unity, and cooperation. The conspiracy of imperialism and reactionaries to create disputes and undermine unity among Asian and African countries, especially between China and certain Asian countries, will surely go bankrupt completely! The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of these countries will surely be continuously consolidated and developed. The Chinese people will forever move forward with redoubled confidence, holding high the banner of Leninism's peaceful foreign policy, based on the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit, and make more efforts and greater contributions to the noble cause of friendly unity of Asian and African peoples and human peace and progress!

### 我们的朋友遍天下  楚图南委员谈我国社会主义建设在国际上发生的影响

专栏：

    我们的朋友遍天下
    楚图南委员谈我国社会主义建设在国际上发生的影响主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。这两个报告，对我国1959年的国民经济建设工作所取得的伟大成就，作了马克思列宁主义的分析和总结，并切合实际地对1960年的国民经济发展，作了合理而又周密和细致的安排。这完全体现了以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东主席的政策思想，为1960年的继续跃进展开了一幅宏伟壮丽的图画。它必将鼓舞我国各族人民继续在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，沿着毛主席所指引的道路，以大跃进的姿态，为提前和超额完成1960年的国家建设计划而奋斗！
    我也完全同意谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告。根据这个报告的总的精神和所部署的一切措施，我们有着完全的信心在党和毛主席的英明正确的领导下，全国人民鼓足干劲，必能完成这个伟大的光荣的任务，使我国农村得到更大的发展，并将出现更美丽更宏伟的社会主义农村新面貌。
    在国际事务方面，1959年我国也取得了巨大的成就。特别在我国建国十周年纪念期间，来自全世界八十七个国家的领导人物和杰出人士，齐集北京，同中国人民一道欢度国庆，并热烈赞扬中国十年来的建设成就。十年来全世界和我国有友好往来和文化联系的，共有一百二十多个国家和地区。这正说明了中国国际地位的空前提高和中国人民的朋友遍布于天下。也说明中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利在国际上发生越来越广泛而深远的影响。
    正是由于这一原因，即使在去年以来，在东南亚地区出现了美帝国主义和一小撮反动分子所掀起的反华、排华的逆流，我国同亚非各国的友好关系仍取得了极大的进展。如不久以前我国同缅甸和尼泊尔先后签定了关于两国边界问题的协定，同缅甸签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，同尼泊尔签订了两国经济援助协定。这不仅使我国同缅甸和尼泊尔的友好关系达到了一个新的阶段，并且为亚非各国的友好合作与和睦相处树立了新的范例。又如不久以前我国在印度展出的农业展览和当前正在东巴基斯坦展出的工农业展览，都受到了当地广大人民的热烈欢迎。我国文化友好代表团和它所率领的民族歌舞团，应邀赴缅甸访问演出，也受到缅甸联邦政府的热忱的接待和缅甸人民的热烈欢迎。这都是我国的和平外交政策和睦邻政策的胜利，也是我国信守不渝地根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的精神，发展同亚非民族主义国家的友好合作关系的胜利。因为中华人民共和国是一个社会主义国家，这就决定了我国的外交政策乃是加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动，同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民建立并发展友好关系。亚非各国人民过去的历史都大致相同，都曾有过被帝国主义侵略和剥削的不幸的遭遇，在今天又有着争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义统治和掠夺、努力改变自己的落后面貌、建设各自的繁荣富强的祖国的共同奋斗目标。这就需要亚非各国在五项原则的基础上，相互团结和合作，以求得共同的繁荣和发展。这是亚非各国共同的根本利益所在，也是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的伟大生命力所在。因此，亚非各国人民对于革命胜利的中国人民、对于坚决执行和平外交政策和根据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神同不同社会制度的国家和平共处的中国人民怀着友好的愿望是很自然的，中国人民对他们的同情和支持也是完全可以理解的。
    帝国主义和一小撮反动分子因为害怕人民力量的高涨和壮大，就千方百计地破坏和分裂亚非各国人民的力量，挑拨离间，并制造关于五项原则和万隆会议精神的种种谰言，企图在亚非各国之间散布不和，特别扇起了一股反华、排华的逆流。但亚非各国有远见的政治家，特别是亚非各国觉悟了的人民，究竟会识破帝国主义和反动分子的任何可耻的诡计和阴谋。而上述的中缅、中尼条约和协定的签订和中缅、中尼友好关系的新发展，以及广大印度人民和巴基斯坦人民对于中国人民的友谊，不仅反映和显示了亚非人民的共同要求和共同愿望，而且也表明了五项原则和万隆精神仍然是指导亚非国家处理国际事务和发展各国之间的友好关系的准则。中国信守不渝地根据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，解决同亚洲各国间历史上遗留下来的问题，为亚非国家的友好团结树立了良好的榜样。这是给帝国主义和反动分子又一次最严重的打击。同时也为亚非各国发展和睦相处、团结合作的新的关系开辟了广阔的光辉的道路。帝国主义和反动分子在亚非各国间，特别是在我国同某些亚洲国家间制造纠纷，破坏团结的阴谋，必将彻底破产！我国人民同这些国家的人民的友谊必将获得不断的巩固和发展。我国人民将永远怀着百倍的信心，高举着列宁主义的和平外交政策的旗帜、根据五项原则和万隆精神，胜利地前进，并为亚非各国人民的友好团结和人类和平进步的崇高事业作出更多的努力和更大的贡献！
