Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 9th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" today condemned U.S. President Eisenhower's renewed attack on Cuba and accused Eisenhower of becoming an arrogant criminal interfering in Cuba's internal affairs.

"Hoy's" editorial pointed out that Eisenhower had finally dropped his mask and dared to accuse the revolutionary leader, beloved by the entire Cuban people, of being a "traitor" to revolutionary ideals.

The editorial emphasized that it was precisely Eisenhower, spreading lies and arrogance, who supported the Cuban traitors and executioner Batista, who cried for the death of former Nicaraguan dictator Somoza Sr., and who aided the current Dominican dictator Trujillo.

The editorial said that it was precisely Eisenhower who betrayed the ideals of Jefferson, Lincoln, and Walt Whitman, while conversely, Fidel Castro knows that José Martí would not be ashamed of him.

"Hoy" pointed out that Eisenhower spoke of the big stick policy in crude language, but he forgot that we are no longer in the era of the big stick policy providing dividends.

"Hoy" emphasized that only the Cuban people can judge the policies of their rulers. No foreign ruler, no matter how powerful their country, no matter how many atomic bomb stockpiles they have, has the right to judge our leaders.

"Hoy" pointed out that all of Cuba opposes Eisenhower's interference. Cuba now has a government that cannot tolerate forceful oppression, and a people who are determined to fully defend national dignity and support the government under the slogan "Sworn to Defend the Motherland."

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower, in a letter issued on the 8th to the Chilean Student Federation, made unwarranted attacks on the Cuban revolutionary government and its leaders, and openly came forward to support Cuban counter-revolutionaries.

This letter was a reply to an open letter written to Eisenhower by the Chilean Student Federation upon his return from a visit to South America. In the letter, representing 25,000 university students across Chile, the Chilean Student Federation condemned U.S. interference in Cuba and the so-called "Pan-American system" promoted by the United States. The letter accused the United States of having a barbaric and immoral attitude toward Cuba.

In his reply, Eisenhower tried his best to deny the consistent U.S. actions of plundering and interfering in Cuba and other Latin American countries. He insisted that the United States was pursuing a "non-interference" policy toward Cuba, and that the U.S. authorities had even "not done anything unfriendly to Cuba or the Cuban people."

However, in the same letter, Eisenhower once again exposed the ferocious face of an interventionist. Eisenhower openly attacked the Cuban government and its leaders for "betraying" the "ideals" of the revolution. He expressed feeling "unfortunate" about the Cuban government and the Cuban people's recent stern counterattack against the anti-communist clamor of counter-revolutionary elements, and crudely supported these counter-revolutionary elements in having the "freedom" to "express opinions inconsistent with the (Cuban) government's policies."

On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Herter also clamored at a press conference in Washington that "anti-communism has now become synonymous with counter-revolution," which is "a very big and disturbing thing" happening in Cuba.

In answering reporters' questions, Herter said that he could not say that relations between the United States and Cuba had improved after Ambassador Bonsal returned to Havana. He said that Ambassador Bonsal had "considerable difficulty" in meeting with the Cuban Foreign Minister because the "Foreign Minister was ill."

Herter said that the United States was "still studying" the issue of taking action on the Cuban Premier's announcement that Cuba did not assume obligations under the Rio de Janeiro Treaty.

He also stated that the United States and the Organization of American States are also considering Premier Castro's criticism of the Caracas anti-communist declaration.

    古巴“今日报”谴责美国总统对卡斯特罗的攻击
    艾森豪威尔是干涉古巴内政的罪犯
    古巴人民决心全力支持政府和保卫国家尊严
    据新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴“今日报”今天谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔对古巴的再度攻击，并指责艾森豪威尔已成为干涉古巴内政的狂妄的罪犯。
    “今日报”的社论指出，艾森豪威尔终于抛掉了假面具，胆敢指责古巴全国人民热爱的革命领袖为革命理想的“叛徒”。
    社论强调指出，正是散布谎言和狂妄的艾森豪威尔，支持古巴的卖国贼和刽子手巴蒂斯塔，为尼加拉瓜前独裁者老索摩查的死而哭泣，援助当前多米尼加的独裁者特鲁希略。
    社论说，正是艾森豪威尔背叛了杰斐逊、林肯和华尔特·惠特曼的理想，而相反，菲德尔·卡斯特罗却知道，何塞·马蒂不会为他感到羞耻。
    “今日报”指出，艾森豪威尔用粗野的语言谈论大棒政策，但是他忘记了我们现在不是处在提供红利的大棒政策的时代。
    “今日报”强调指出，只有古巴人民才能评定他们的执政者的政策。任何一个外国执政者，不管这个国家的力量多么强大，不管它有多少原子弹贮存库，都没有权利来鉴定我们的领导人。
      “今日报”指出，全古巴都反对艾森豪威尔的干涉行为。古巴现在有一个不能容忍强力压迫的政府，和在“誓死保卫祖国”的口号下决心全力保卫国家尊严、支持政府的人民。
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在8日发出的一封写给智利学生联合会的信中，对古巴革命政府及其领导人进行无理的攻击，并且公开出面为古巴的反革命分子撑腰。
    这封信是对智利学生联合会在艾森豪威尔访问南美回国时写给他的一封公开信的答复。智利学生联合会在代表智利全国二万五千名大学生发出的这封信中，谴责了美国对古巴的干涉和美国宣扬的所谓“泛美体系”。信中指责美国对古巴的态度是野蛮和不道德的。
    艾森豪威尔在这封复信里竭力抵赖美国一贯掠夺、干涉古巴和其它拉丁美洲国家的行动。他硬说美国对古巴实行的是“不干涉”政策，美国当局甚至“没有做任何对古巴或古巴人民不友好的事情”。
    但是，就在同一封信中，艾森豪威尔却再次暴露出干涉者的凶恶嘴脸。艾森豪威尔公然攻击古巴政府及其领导人“背叛”了革命的“理想”。他对古巴政府和古巴人民最近严正反击反革命分子的反共叫嚣表示感到“不幸”，并且粗暴地支持这些反革命分子有所谓“表达同（古巴）政府的政策不一致的意见”的“自由”。
    同一天，美国国务卿赫脱在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上也叫嚷说，“反共现在成了反革命的同义语”，这是正在古巴发生的“一件很大的令人不安的事情”。
    赫脱在回答记者问题时说，他不能说在邦沙尔大使返回哈瓦那之后，美国同古巴的关系有了改善。他说，邦沙尔大使在会见古巴外交部长方面“有相当大的困难”，因为“外交部长病了”。
    赫脱说，美国“仍然在研究”就古巴总理宣布古巴不对里约热内卢公约承担义务这件事采取行动的问题。
    他还表示，美国以及美洲国家组织也正在考虑卡斯特罗总理指责加拉加斯反共宣言的问题。
