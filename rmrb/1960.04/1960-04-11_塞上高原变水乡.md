The moment you mentioned the border plateau outside Yanmen Pass in the past, it gave people the impression of "vast land and sparse population" and "a desolate scene," seemingly hopelessly poor.

Was this an exaggeration? If we look at the scene of the Dengta People's Commune in Zuoyun County fifteen years ago, it was indeed the case. Fifteen years ago, the yield of grain per mu in this area was only about thirty jin, and at most forty or fifty jin in good years.

At that time, among the 2,179 households belonging to what is now this commune, 436 households fled outside the pass, 218 households begged for food, 174 households sold their daughters, and 109 households sold their wives...

The current Dengta Commune still has the same area and the same climate conditions as before, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, its appearance has fundamentally changed. The commune is surrounded by lush green mountains and fragrant wildflowers. At the foot of the mountains, green trees provide shade, and reservoirs form a network; canals and field ridges crisscross, straight and flat. When night falls, the sound of machines rumbles, and thousands of electric lights shine brightly, dimming the stars in the sky. Nowadays:

	The Yanmen Pass outside is communized,
	Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are one family.
	Hundreds of miles of fertile grass feed strong cattle and sheep,
	Peach and apricot blossoms bloom everywhere in the spring.
	After the rain in June, the mountain tops are green,
	No more fierce winds and yellow sand.
	People in Jiangnan won't believe it,
	The Western Lake of the border region raises fish and shrimp.

Was such a scene easily achieved? This was obtained by the Party leading the people of the entire commune through many struggles. The people of the Dengta Commune have long known that in order to fundamentally change their poor situation, they must first control the mountains and rivers, turn poor mountains into rich mountains, and turn water hazards into water conservancy. In the spring of 1958, Shiguantun vigorously engaged in water conservancy. The common saying among the people was "Controlling mountains and rivers, man will conquer nature, eating depends on ourselves, not on the heavens." Flooding the fields was the first time. Thousands of eyes watched intently. When streams of canal water obediently flowed into the fields according to people's will, people jumped and cheered!

Since then, a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction has been set off throughout the commune. However, despite the continuous success and early completion of projects such as the "Five Nights Canal," the "July 1st Canal," and the "Women's Canal," the broad masses were not satisfied. They believed that irrigation with floodwater canals alone was not enough, and they also needed to open up water sources, planning to dig a well every ten mu to prepare for times of drought. In winter, according to the demands of the masses, the Party led the people of the entire commune to carry out the "Double Canal" movement, digging wells, building reservoirs, and digging spring eyes, creating an even more massive high tide of water conservancy.

One day in November 1958, earth-shattering cannon sounds rang out at the canyon entrance of Shatou Mountain. This cannon sound opened the prelude to a large-scale march towards nature, and this cannon sound began to turn the beautiful wishes of the working masses for thousands of years into reality.

We are determined to successfully build such a comprehensive reservoir with a storage capacity of 27 million cubic meters, which is mainly for irrigation and can also generate electricity, raise fish, prevent floods, and be used for planting. Of course, there are many difficulties, but how can difficulties stop the soaring enthusiasm of all the members of the heroic Dengta Commune?

People further realized the collectivization of household labor and vigorously reformed tools, excavating more than 200,000 man-days of labor.

As everyone knows, the water-facing side of the earth dam is subjected to the tremendous pressure of the reservoir water day and night; protecting the dam is to protect the life of the reservoir. Of course, it is best to reinforce the dam surface with masonry. However, where would so much labor come from to quarry stones and take square measures, and where would so much cement be available for grouting? A Zhuge Liang meeting came up with a brilliant plan, which was to cut a kind of sod called "cunzi grass" into grass bricks and build them on the dam surface. Once the sod gets wet, it connects into one piece and grows into one piece. The wetter it gets, the tighter it grows, and the tighter it can withstand the water. The masses called it "grass that enrages cement."

If it is said that there was not a single engineering technician in the construction of this reservoir, that would not be realistic. Not only were there any, but there were a hundred or so of them. They are native experts who have been trained through practice. Everything here is unfamiliar to the vast majority of people, but what does it matter? If you don't have the technology, study it; if the operation is wrong, correct it; if you fail once, do it again.

In the winter on the border plateau, the outdoor temperature often remains at a severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius. When digging the foundation of the main dam, quicksand was encountered. The bonding trench that was excavated that day was filled with quicksand at night. Communist Party member Ba Hongru picked up a pair of buckets and jumped into the water to carry it. That's right! This is a good way. Plop, plop, in the blink of an eye, the bonding trench was filled with people. This battle of "wreaking havoc in the Crystal Palace in the ice and snow" showed the great heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of the masses. This is the original driving force for the border plateau to become a land of water.

Difficulties, in the face of the wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of the masses, melted away quickly, like ice and snow encountering the sunshine of July. In just two hundred and ninety-five days, the entire "Dishui Reservoir" was completed. However, the battle did not stop. As of the end of March 1960, fifteen more reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 10.06 million cubic meters had been completed and put into production.

Now the entire commune has a total of twenty-one large and small reservoirs, and sixty-five large and small canals, connected together, gradually forming a complete water conservancy irrigation network. The sandy slopes that used to "only raise marmots and not people" are now turning into clay soil. As the land becomes moist, the dry climate will also become humid, and there will be less wind and sand. Increased grain production is now guaranteed. In 1959, the average grain yield per person in the entire commune reached 1,300 jin, doubling that of 1949. In 1960, we strive to break through 2,000 jin per person on average.

The desolate border plateau has thus turned into a land of water. The heroic people who personally changed the face of their hometown have not stopped. Under the guidance of the Party, we will continue our efforts to build the border plateau even more beautiful and prosperous!

    塞上高原变水乡	中共山西左云县委第一书记　关毅	中共山西左云县委书记　庞汉杰
    过去一提起雁门关外的塞上高原，就给人们一种感觉，好像是“地广人稀”“一片荒凉”，不知怎么穷苦似的。
    这是否言过其实呢？如果以左云灯塔人民公社十五年前的景象来说，确也就是如此。十五年前，这地方亩产粮食不过三十来斤，好年成至多四、五十斤。
    当时，属于现在这个公社的二千一百七十九户人家，有四百三十六户逃出口外，有二百一十八户讨饭吃，有一百七十四户卖了女儿，有一百零九户卖了老婆。……
    现在的灯塔公社还是原来的地区原来的气候条件，但是在共产党的领导下，面貌根本改变了。公社四周，群山葱翠，野花芬芳，山下绿树成荫，水库成网；渠道地埂交错纵横笔直平坦。到夜幕来临，机器声隆隆，千百盏电灯光芒四射，照得天上星星黯然失色。如今正是：
    雁门关外公社化，
    工农商学兵一家。
    百里草肥牛羊壮，
    三春到处桃杏花。
    六月雨过山头绿，
    不见狂风无黄沙。
    说与江南人不信，
    塞上西湖养鱼虾。
    这样的景象是容易得来的吗？这是党领导着全社人民经过许多的斗争获得的。灯塔公社的人民早就知道要想彻底改变穷苦面貌，首先必须治山治水，变穷山为富山，变水害为水利。施官屯1958年春天大搞水利，人们的共同语言是“治山治水，人定胜天，吃饭靠自己，不能靠老天”。洪水灌田这是第一次，千百双眼睛注视着，当一道道渠水按照人的意志乖乖地流进田地的时候，人们又是跳跃，又是欢呼！
    从此，全公社掀起了大兴水利的高潮。不过，尽管“五夜渠”“七一渠”，“妇女渠”等不断告捷，提前完成，广大群众却不满足。他们认为只有洪水渠灌溉还是不够的，还要开辟水源，计议每隔十亩打水井一眼，备天旱时用。到冬天，根据群众的要求，党领导全社人们开展了“双渠”运动，打水井、修水库、挖泉眼，一个声势更加浩大的水利高潮出现了。
    1958年11月里的一天，在?头山的峡口响起震天动地的炮声。这炮声揭开了大规模向大自然进军的序幕，这炮声使劳动群众千百年来的美好愿望开始变成现实。
    我们定要把这样一个蓄水二千七百万公方，以灌溉为主，并能发电、养鱼、防洪、种植的综合性的水库建设成功。困难当然是很多的，但是困难哪里能够阻挡住英雄的灯塔公社全体社员的冲天干劲？
    人们进一步实现家务劳动集体化和大闹工具改革，挖掘出了二十多万个人工。
    大家知道，土坝的迎水面，日日夜夜受着库水的巨大压力；保护好大坝，就是保护好水库的生命。当然，最好在坝面上砌石加固。但是，哪里有这么多的人工来采石取方，又哪里有那么多的灌浆用的水泥？一次诸葛亮会议献出了一条妙计，这种办法就是把一种叫“寸子草”的草皮切成一块块的草砖，砌在坝面上。草皮一着水，就连成一片，长成一块，越着水长得越紧，越紧越能顶住水。群众把它叫做“气死水泥”。
    如果说修建这个水库没有一个工程技术人员，那是不切合实际的。不仅是有，而且有上百人的一批。他们是土生土长的从实践中锻炼出来的“土专家”。这里的一切，对于绝大多数人来说都是陌生的，但这有什么关系呢？没技术，研究；操作不对，纠正；失败一次，再干。
    在塞上高原的冬天，户外经常保持着零下三十度的严寒气候。正在挖主坝基础时，遇到了流沙。当天开挖的结合槽，黑夜就被流沙填满了。共产党员巴洪儒挑起一副桶，跳入水中就担。对！这是好办法。扑通扑通，转眼结合槽中站满了人。这一场“冰天雪地大闹水晶宫”的战斗，显示了群众的伟大的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义精神。这是塞上高原变水乡的原动力。
    困难在群众的智慧和冲天干劲面前，像冰雪遇到7月的阳光照射一般，迅速消融了。只不过是二百九十五天的时间，这个“滴水沿水库”全部建成了。但是，战斗并没有停止，截至1960年3月底止，全社又有十五座蓄水总量一千零六十万公方的水库建成并投入生产。
    现在全社共有二十一座大小水库，六十五道大小渠道，联成一片，逐渐形成了一套完整的水利灌溉网。一向“只养黄鼠不养人”的沙坡地，正在变成泥膏土。地湿土变，干旱的气候也将变得湿润起来，风沙也会少了。粮食增产从此有了保障。1959年全社平均每人粮食产量达到一千三百斤，比1949年翻了一番。1960年力争平均每人突破二千斤。
    荒凉的塞上高原，就这样变成了水乡。亲手改变了家乡面貌的英雄人民，并没有停下脚步，在党的指引下，我们再接再厉，要把塞上高原建设得更加美好和繁荣！
