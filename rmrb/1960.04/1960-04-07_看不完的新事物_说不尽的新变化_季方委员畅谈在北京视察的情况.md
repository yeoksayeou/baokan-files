Fellow Deputies, Fellow Members, Fellow Comrades:

I express my warm support for Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget.

The two Vice Premiers' reports extremely correctly expounded the immense power of the three great treasures of the socialist construction period—the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes—in 1959; they extremely correctly summarized the construction experiences and great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao in 1959 by adhering to the three great treasures. The two Vice Premiers' reports also put forward the task of continuing the Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1960 to the people of the whole country, presenting a magnificent and splendid prospect for the people of the whole country. All of this cannot but make people feel extremely excited and incomparably excited; it cannot but inspire people to strive with full confidence to fulfill and over fulfill the 1960 national economic plan for a continued Great Leap Forward.

As I sat in the Great Hall of the People listening to the reports of the two Vice Premiers, a thought couldn't help but arise and linger in my mind, which was: "Splendid numbers, brilliant poems." The total output value of industry and agriculture in 1959 increased by 31.1% compared with 1958, and had already increased by 94.4% compared with 1957, while 1960 will increase by 23% compared with 1959. There are many similar figures in the entire report, which are truly sonorous and shining. What numbers could be more beautiful and moving than these numbers? And aren't our past glorious achievements and future magnificent prospects composing the most exciting and brilliant poems?

In the capital of the great motherland, production and construction are developing by leaps and bounds

Brilliant poems are composed of many beautiful and moving chapters. Before this meeting, I participated in the inspection of Beijing. In the capital of our great motherland, I personally saw many beautiful and moving chapters in the brilliant poems. The endless new things, the inexhaustible new changes, the countless new people, all indicate that the "poor and blank" face of our country is changing by leaps and bounds at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, just as our great leader Chairman Mao once predicted: new and beautiful pictures are painted on white paper. They all also indicate that the General Line has already penetrated deep into people's hearts, its brilliance illuminates every corner, and Mao Zedong Thought has achieved a great victory.

I saw in Beijing that production and construction are developing by leaps and bounds, and deeply realized how important it is to adhere to the General Line and the speed of the Great Leap Forward for building socialism and changing the face of the country. Beijing has historically been a consumer city under feudal rule. After liberation, it gained new life, but the transformation from a consumer city to a production city is prominently reflected in the recent two years. Walking out of Beijing to the eastern suburbs, chimneys stand tall like forests, and smoke fills the sky. No wonder some people say, "It's really like coming to some cities in Northeast China, our industrial base." Many factories in this large factory area were established during the Great Leap Forward. For example, the coking chemical plant that supplies our Great Hall of the People (and other units) with its byproduct gas was only started on March 18 last year. A coke oven and corresponding system were built in eight months, while normally it would take at least one year to one and a half years. The construction of the thermal power plant coincided with the two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. Under normal circumstances, it would take four to five years to build such a plant, but in reality, we only used two years and two months. From the production perspective, the electronic tube factory reached its designed level in 1958, which it was originally supposed to reach this year, and on the basis of 1958, their output in 1959 increased by another 73%; the Guanghua Wood Factory's total output value in 1958 was almost equal to the total of the first Five-Year Plan, and on the basis of 1958, their output value in 1959 increased by another 63%. These are all modern factories, and their production has increased so significantly. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward?

Beijing's streets are also rapidly changing their appearance at the speed of the Great Leap Forward. Although some Hutongs still appear narrow due to historical reasons, their appearance is exceptionally tidy; and more importantly, there has been a qualitative change inside. Taking the streets under the jurisdiction of the Da Shi Lan'r Office as an example, in just over a year, more than a dozen factories with considerable scale have been established, including heavy industrial factories with three to five hundred people, such as electrical machinery factories, metal manufacturing factories, insulation factories, and glass instrument factories. The entire street office completed a total output value of 2.4 million yuan in December last year, an increase of seven times compared with January last year. When seeing electrical equipment with the brand "Da Shi Lan'r Electrical Machinery Factory" on the streets, how can one not cheer for the profound changes that have taken place in the streets? And how can it not be a Great Leap Forward that the industrial front has added this new force of urban people's communes and street industries? As for the products of some industrial enterprises, they are also developing in the direction of high quality, large size, precision, and novelty. When seeing semiconductor electronic tubes, program-controlled machine tools, plastic honeycomb panels, high-efficiency combined machine tools with fifty drill bits, coke ovens with an annual output of 500,000 tons... etc., one can't help but feel unspeakable excitement. The face of our country's industry is changing by leaps and bounds.

While production and construction are developing rapidly, new figures are also growing in large numbers

While production and construction are developing at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and while the face of the national economy is changing with the face of the Great Leap Forward, new figures are also growing in large numbers. Taking the residents of the Da Shi Lan'r Office as an example, a 59-year-old woman, Granny Liu, was still a housewife a year ago. Under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, she participated in street production and is now an advanced worker in Xuanwu District; a woman who used to work as a nanny has become an advanced worker in Beijing after participating in street production for more than half a year. Whether from a political position or from a mental outlook, they can be said to be brand new figures. As for the younger generation, the successors of the revolution, the students of Tsinghua University have also left a deep impression. In the past, the vast majority of college students were "scholars" and "delicate scholars," but in the past year or two, there have been fundamental changes. They followed the Party's instructions, studied and worked simultaneously, were both red and expert, and participated in labor production with real swords and guns while studying. Under the leadership of the Party, they participated in the design of the Miyun Reservoir and the National Grand Theater, and jointly trial-produced program-controlled machine tools with factories; next to the machines in the metal factory, one can see college students with greasy hands, and a female student who graduated in 1955 is now the Party branch secretary of the mechanical engineering department. These new figures can be said to be the children of the Great Leap Forward. These new forces also make people feel respectable, lovable, infinitely potential, and have immeasurable prospects.

I find it difficult to describe these tremendous changes over the past year or so in words and writing; but I believe that the three words "Great Leap Forward" can completely and accurately explain this change. Recalling that last year when we adjusted the targets of the national economic plan, the imperialists frantically clamored, and the domestic anti-socialist elements and right-leaning opportunists also attacked the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, vainly trying to make our cause regress to the capitalist road, but now the facts of the Great Leap Forward have ruthlessly and thoroughly shattered their dreams. At that time, there were also some people who had doubts and wavering about the Great Leap Forward. Now, in the face of the facts of the Great Leap Forward, they should have awakened.

The large-scale emergence of new things and new figures is due to the unparalleled power of the "three treasures" and the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

Comrades, the entire nation is completely and clearly aware that the achievement of these great achievements is due to the unparalleled power of the three great treasures of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminating our path forward. During the inspection process, everywhere I could feel the material strength unleashed by mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's ideas about putting politics in command, about continuous revolution, about emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions, about walking on two legs, about vigorously launching mass movements, and so on, are shining brightly everywhere. In the street service stations, we saw many service personnel. Their slogan is "Not afraid of getting dirty, not afraid of getting tired, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of trouble." Why can they do this? They all said in unison: "Now politics is in command!" The changes in the street residents mentioned earlier are due to their recognition of the correctness of the People's Commune road, actively participating in street production, and the Party vigorously organizing people's economic life, ensuring that they can concentrate on production. Many advanced units, such as the electronic tube factory, have repeatedly made great leaps in production, but they still redoubled their efforts to propose continued leap forward targets. Their slogan is "Good start, monthly increase, quarterly leap, full house red." Why can they do this? They all emphasized: "We must constantly revolutionize!" Some modern enterprises are also adopting the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods to promote production. The liberated people of China have daring pathbreakers everywhere who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. For example, the equipment of the synthetic fiber factory was imported from abroad. Originally, foreign experts were to be waited for to guide the installation, but due to the display of the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, the workers proposed to install it themselves. As a result, the equipment that was originally planned to be installed in one year was completed in seven and a half months, with excellent quality. Vigorous mass movements are also being carried out everywhere. Mass movements are being carried out in industrial production, and mass movements are also being carried out in higher education. For example, in Tsinghua University's teaching, research, and production work, everyone is organized to propose plans, teachers propose them, and students propose them. Then everyone competes, each stating the basis of their plan. The quality of the plans produced in this way is of course high, and the quality of the students trained is of course also high. All of this makes people deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon that is invincible and unconquerable. With the masses of people who have been nurtured and educated by Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping and using this powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, the socialist construction cause will inevitably develop at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and no force can stop it.

Whether in factories or schools, in hospitals or streets, the scene of technical revolution is boiling everywhere

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, what needs to be particularly mentioned is the technical innovation and technical revolution movement that is currently unfolding across the country with the force of ten thousand horses galloping and mountains toppling over the sea. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report that due to the development of this movement, a boiling scene like that of the great steel smelting in 1958 has appeared. During the inspection process, I personally saw this moving boiling scene. Everywhere I went, whether it was a factory or a school, a hospital or a street, everyone was vigorously carrying out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The broad masses of people warmly welcomed this movement, calling it the "second liberation," and participated in this movement with enthusiasm, forgetting sleep and food. "Innovation enthusiasts" are everywhere. From the perspective of effectiveness, "one rope and one hook make a revolution," which will immediately double production several times. For example, the Guanghua Wood Factory used to make herringbone floors, which required five pieces of equipment, five processes, nineteen people, and more than thirty hours to produce finished products. After technical innovation, a floor joint machine was made, which requires three pieces of equipment, three people, and five minutes to produce finished products. The electronic tube factory originally planned to increase production by 36% more than last year at the beginning of this year, but as soon as the technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched, the targets had to be considered for adjustment, because exceeding 36% was as stable as Mount Tai, and higher targets could be proposed.

Due to the vigorous technical revolution, it is entirely possible to achieve increased production without increasing manpower or even reducing it. At the same time, workers are liberated from some heavy physical labor, and they have more time to study politics, culture, and technology. This has a more profound meaning for the intellectualization of workers and peasants. For example, everyone knows that the work of cooks is relatively hard. After others finish dinner, they still have a lot to do. The cooks in the cafeteria of the First Machine Tool Factory used to have very little time to watch dramas. But after vigorously promoting mechanization, they have more time to study culture, watch TV, and even rehearse the drama "Happy Family" themselves; at the same time, they have more time to consider the variety of staple and non-staple foods, and the work is getting better and better. Therefore, this mass-based movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has unparalleled and strong vitality. Although it has only appeared recently, it has already given production a new look. Therefore, it can be completely affirmed that the further development of this movement will definitely further promote the Great Leap Forward in production, and will definitely guarantee the high-speed and leap-forward development of our country's socialist construction.

Comrades, what I have said above has been repeatedly said by many deputies and members in group discussions and plenary speeches; especially many deputies and members who come directly from the industrial and agricultural production front and from the grassroots, they have a deeper and more practical understanding than me. But I still want to repeat all of this, because all of this shocks my heartstrings, it is the most central thing in my heart, it makes me extremely excited, so I must pour it out. In my youth and middle age, I also participated in the Xinhai Revolution and the First Revolutionary Civil War, and had various ideals about the revolution, eager to build China into a rich and strong country. But at that time, I had never imagined building China into a country like it is today? During this inspection, I contacted some older comrades and old gentlemen more than once. Everyone was grateful that they had lived to this day, grateful that they had lived to the Mao Zedong era, grateful that the beautiful pictures that they had never imagined were being presented before their eyes, and grateful that even more beautiful pictures would appear before their eyes. In short, with the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the three great treasures of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, with the people whose communist style is getting higher and higher, with the mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and with the support of our great allies and other fraternal countries, we are 100% confident that the 1960 national economic plan can be completed and over fulfilled; at the same time, we also believe with full confidence that a modern, prosperous, and strong socialist country will be built by leaps and bounds in the hands of our 650 million people; the vast majority of older comrades and old gentlemen will definitely be able to see the arrival of communist society.

The members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should learn from the workers and peasants and continue to work hard to transform their political positions and worldviews

Finally, I would like to say that over the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have also made great progress in service and transformation. The vast majority of people actively serve the socialist cause and actively serve the workers and peasants. The members of the medical and health circles have come out of the hospitals, gone to factories and mines, and gone to the countryside, contributing their strength to industrial and agricultural production; they have also made many achievements in carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, diagnosing and treating difficult diseases, and rescuing critically ill patients. Among the members in the fields of medicine and health, engineering technology, and culture and education, many people have been rated as advanced workers, activists, and red flag bearers. On the other hand, on the basis of the anti-rightist rectification campaign, over the past two years, the members' political and ideological awareness has taken another big step to the left, and their understanding of firmly accepting the Party's leadership and taking the socialist road has been further improved. These advances are entirely the great victory of the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the bourgeois intellectuals, the great victory of the Party's united front policy, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Although we have made great progress, generally speaking, the bourgeois political position has not yet been fundamentally transformed, the two-sidedness still exists, there are still varying degrees of doubt and wavering about the Party's leadership and the three red flags, some people even have resistance and dissatisfaction, and in terms of the drive to serve socialism, we are still far, far behind the workers and peasants. Therefore, we still need to continue to work hard to transform our political positions and worldviews. We express to the people of the whole country that we must, under the leadership of the Party, earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry out fundamental self-transformation, go all out, aim high, invest ourselves in the technical revolution and cultural revolution, serve socialism more actively, and work with the people of the whole country to strive to over fulfill the 1960 national economic plans, and strive to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture at high speed.

### 看不完的新事物　说不尽的新变化  季方委员畅谈在北京视察的情况

    看不完的新事物　说不尽的新变化
    季方委员畅谈在北京视察的情况各位代表、各位委员、各位同志：
    我怀着无比兴奋的心情，对李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告及李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，表示热烈的拥护。
    两位副总理的报告，极其正确地阐述了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这社会主义建设时期的三大法宝，在1959年所发挥的巨大威力；极其正确地总结了1959年我国人民在党和毛主席领导下，坚持三大法宝所取得的建设经验和伟大胜利。两位副总理的报告，同时又向全国人民提出了1960年国民经济继续跃进的任务，为全国人民展示了一幅宏伟壮丽的前景。所有这一切，不能不使人们感到万分的激动和无比的兴奋；不能不激发人们满怀信心地去为完成和超额完成1960年继续跃进的国民经济计划而努力奋斗。
    当我坐在人民大会堂听着两位副总理报告的时候，一个念头不禁油然而起并萦缠在我的脑际，那就是：“辉煌的数字，灿烂的诗篇”。1959年的工农业的总产值比1958年增长31.1％，比1957年已增长了94.4％，而1960年比1959年还要增长23％，整个报告中类似这样的一些数字很多，真是锵锵作响、闪闪发光，还有什么数字能比这些数字更美丽、更动人呢？而我们过去的光辉成就和未来的宏伟图景，不正组成了最激动人心的灿烂的诗篇吗？
    在伟大祖国的首都，生产建设正在飞跃地发展
    灿烂的诗篇是由许多美丽的动人的章节组成的。我在这次会议以前，曾经参加了北京市的视察，在我们伟大祖国的首都，我亲眼看到了灿烂诗篇中的许多美丽动人的章节。看不完的新事物，说不尽的新变化，数不清的新人物，没有一点不说明我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌正在以大跃进的速度飞跃改变，正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所曾预言的那样：白纸上画上了新的美丽的图画。也没有一点不说明总路线已经是深入人心，它的光辉照亮了每个角落，毛泽东思想取得了伟大的胜利。
    我在北京看到了生产建设正在飞跃地发展，深刻地体会到了坚持总路线大跃进的速度对于建设社会主义、改变国家面貌有着多么重大的意义。北京在历史上一直是一个封建统治的消费城市，解放以后获得了新生，但是从消费城市到生产城市的转变，突出地还是表现在最近两年中。走出北京城来到东郊，烟囱高耸如林，烟雾迷漫天空，无怪乎有人说：“真像来到了我国工业基地的东北一些城市一样了。”这一大片工厂区中，许多厂是在大跃进中建立起来的。像以它的副产品煤气供给我们人民大会堂（以及其他单位）的炼焦化学厂，就是在去年3月18日才开工建设的，八个月就建成了一座焦炉及相应的系统，通常的情况则至少需要一年至一年半；热电厂刚开始建设就赶上了1958年和1959年的两年大跃进，一般情况建这样的厂要四年至五年，而实际上我们只用了两年零两个月。从生产方面看，如电子管厂在1958年就达到了它原应在今年才达到的设计水平，而在1958年的基础上，他们在1959年的产量又增长了73％；光华木材厂1958年生产总值几乎等于第一个五年计划的总量，而在1958年的基础上，他们在1959年的产值又增长了63％。这些都是具有现代化水平的厂，而在生产上竟有这样大幅度的增长，这不是大跃进又是什么呢？
    北京的街道也在以大跃进的速度迅速地改变着它的面貌。尽管一些胡同由于历史遗留下来的原因仍还显得很狭窄，但外貌已经是异常整洁；而更其重要的是它的内部，已经有了质的变化。以大栅栏办事处所属的街道为例来看。一年多来竟已建立了具有相当规模的工厂十多个，包括了电机厂、金属制造厂、绝缘厂、玻璃仪器厂等等这样有三、五百人的重工业厂，整个街道办事处在去年12月产值就完成了二百四十万元，比去年1月份翻了七番。当看到街道上出现了钉着“大栅栏电机厂”牌子的电机设备时，怎能不叫人欢呼街道发生了深刻的变化呢？而工业战线上增加了城市人民公社和街道工业这一批新的生力军，又怎能不是一个大跃进呢？至于一些工业企业的产品，也已经是向高大精尖新等方面发展，当看到半导体的电子管，程序控制机床，塑料蜂窝板、有五十个钻头的高效组合机床、年产五十万吨的焦炉……等等，真是说不出的兴奋，我国的工业面貌是在大跃进地变化。
    在生产建设迅速发展的同时，新人物也在大量成长
    在生产建设以大跃进的速度发展的同时，在国家经济面貌以大跃进的面貌起着变化的同时，新的人物也正在大量地成长起来。以大栅栏办事处的居民为例，一个五十九岁的刘老大娘，一年前还是个家庭妇女，在总路线大跃进人民公社三面红旗的引导下，她参加了街道生产，现在成为宣武区的先进工作者；一个过去为人做保姆的妇女，参加街道生产半年多，就成了北京市的先进工作者。无论从政治地位上或者是精神面貌上，她们都可以说是崭新的人物。而以革命的接班人青年一代来说，清华大学的学生也给人留下了深刻的印象。过去的大学生，绝大多数是“秀才”、是“白面书生”，可是这一两年来却起了根本的变化。他们遵照党的指示，亦学亦工，又红又专，在读书的同时，真刀真枪地参加劳动生产，在党的领导下，和老师们一道参加了密云水库和国家大剧院等等建设的设计，与工厂合作试制程序控制机床；在金工厂的机器旁边看到满手油腻的大学生，而一个1955年毕业的女学生现在是机械系的党支部书记。这些新人物可以说都是大跃进中的产儿，这些新生力量也使人感到可敬可爱、潜力无穷，前途无量。
    对一年多来的这些巨大变化，我是很难用语言和文字来描述的；但我认为，“大跃进”三个字，又完全可以概括而确切地说明这种变化。回想去年当我们调整国民经济计划指标的时候，帝国主义者曾经疯狂叫嚣，国内的反社会主义分子和右倾机会主义分子也曾攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，妄想我们的事业倒退到资本主义道路上去，但是现在大跃进的事实，却无情地彻底粉碎了他们的梦想。那时也有一些对大跃进发生怀疑和动摇的人，现在在大跃进的事实面前，他们应该清醒过来了吧。
    新事物和新人物的大量出现，是由于“三个法宝”的无比威力，是由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导
    各位同志，这些伟大成就的取得，全国人民完全一致地清楚地了解到是由于总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的无比威力，是由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导，是由于毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了我们前进的道路。我在视察的过程中，到处都可以感到由于掌握了毛泽东思想而发挥出来的物质力量。毛主席关于政治挂帅，关于不断革命，关于解放思想破除迷信，关于两条腿走路的方针，关于大搞群众运动等等的思想，到处闪烁着夺目的光辉。我们在街道服务站，看到许多服务人员。他们的口号是“不怕脏、不怕累、不怕苦、不怕烦”。为什么能这样？他们异口同声地说：“现在是政治挂帅”！前面谈到的街道居民的变化，就是由于他们认识到了人民公社道路的正确性，积极参加了街道生产，同时党又大力组织人民经济生活，保证了她们安心生产，从而才取得的。许多先进单位像电子管厂等，生产是一再大跃进，但他们仍然加倍努力提出继续跃进的指标，他们的口号是“开门红、月月升、季季跃、满堂红”。为什么能这样？他们都强调：“要不断革命！”一些现代化的企业，也都是采用土洋并举的两条腿走路的方针来促进生产。解放了的中国的人民到处都有敢想敢说敢做的闯将。像合成纤维厂的设备是国外进口，本来要等外国专家来指导安装，但由于发挥了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，工人提出自己安装，结果原计划要安装一年的设备，七个半月就完成了，质量很好。轰轰烈烈的群众运动也是到处开展，工业生产搞群众运动，高等教育也在搞群众运动。像清华大学的教学科研生产工作，组织大家提方案，老师提，学生也提，然后大家打擂台，各述自己方案的根据。这样产生出来的方案质量当然高，培养出来的学生质量当然也就高了。所有这一切都叫人深深地体会到：毛泽东思想是战无不胜攻无不克的有力武器，有着受了毛泽东思想熏陶教育的人民群众，紧紧地掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个有力武器，社会主义建设事业必然要以大跃进的速度发展，必然是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    不管工厂和学校，无论医院或街道，到处沸腾着技术革命的景象
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，还需要特别提出的，就是目前全国各地正在以万马奔腾、排山倒海之势开展着的技术革新和技术革命运动。李富春副总理的报告中说，由于这个运动的开展，已经出现了像1958年大炼钢铁时那样的沸腾景象。我在视察的过程中，就亲自看到了这个动人的沸腾景象。走到任何单位，不管是工厂还是学校，是医院还是街道，都在大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。广大群众热烈地欢迎这个运动，把它称做是“第二次解放”，废寝忘食地参加这个运动，“革新迷”到处都是。而从效果上看，“一绳一钩闹革命”，都会使生产马上翻几番。例如光华木材厂，过去做人字地板，要五台设备、五道工序，十九个人，三十多小时才出成品，而经过技术革新做成了地板联合机，用三台设备，三个人，五分钟就可以出成品。电子管厂今年初原订计划是要比去年再增产36％，但是技术革新和技术革命运动一开展，指标就要考虑调整了，因为超额36％已是稳如泰山，完全可以提出更高的指标。
    由于大闹技术革命，增产不增人乃至减少，完全可以实现。同时工人从一些繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，就有了更多的时间学习政治、文化、技术。这对工农群众知识化来说，又有着更深刻的意义。譬如说，大家都知道炊事员的工作是比较辛苦的，别人吃完晚饭，他还有许多事要做。像第一机床厂食堂的炊事员过去连看戏的时间都很少。但大搞机械化以后，就多出时间来学习文化、看电视、甚至自己排演了话剧“全家福”；同时，他们也就有了更多的时间，来考虑主食和副食的花样变化，工作就越做越好。所以，技术革新和技术革命这个具有广泛群众性的运动，具有无比强盛的生命力，现在虽然是刚刚出现不久，但已经使生产有了更新的面貌。因此完全可以肯定，这个运动更深入一步地开展，一定会更加促进生产上的大跃进，一定能够保证我国社会主义建设更加高速度地飞跃发展。
    各位同志，我上面所说的这些，是许多代表和委员们在分组讨论和大会发言中反复说过了的；特别是许多直接来自工农业生产战线、来自基层的代表和委员，他们有着比我更深刻、更实际的体会。但是我仍然要重复地叙说这一切，因为这一切震激着我的心弦，是占据在我的心灵中最中心的东西，它使我万分兴奋，因此，一定要把它倾诉出来。我在青年和中年时代，也曾经参加过辛亥革命和第一次国内革命战争，对革命有着种种理想，渴望把中国建设成为一个富强的国家。但是在那个时候，何曾幻想过要把中国建设成为像今天这样的面貌？在这次视察中，我不止一次地接触到一些年龄较大的老同志、老先生，大家都庆幸自己活到了今天，庆幸自己活到了毛泽东时代，庆幸自己从来没有设想过的美丽的图画，正在自己眼前展现出来，庆幸自己的眼前还会有更加美丽的图画出现。总之，有着党和毛主席的英明领导，有着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，有着共产主义风格越来越高的人民群众，有着具有广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，有着我们伟大盟邦和其他兄弟国家的支援，我们信心百倍地肯定：1960年国民经济计划一定可以完成和超额完成；同时我们也满怀信心地相信：一个现代化的富强的社会主义的国家，一定会以大跃进的高速度在我们六亿五千万人民的双手中建成；绝大多数年龄较大的老同志、老先生还一定可以看到共产主义社会的到来。
    农工民主党的成员应当向工农群众学习，继续努力进行政治立场和世界观的改造
    最后，我想说一下，农工民主党的成员一年多来在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在服务和改造方面也都有了很大的进步。绝大多数的人积极地为社会主义事业服务，积极地为工农群众服务。医药卫生界的成员，从医院里走出来，下厂矿、下农村，为工农业生产贡献了自己的力量；在发扬祖国医学遗产、诊治疑难病症、抢救垂危病人等方面也做出了不少的成绩。在医药卫生、工程技术和文教界的成员中，不少人被评为先进工作者、积极分子、红旗手等。另一方面，在反右整风的基础上，两年多来，成员的政治思想觉悟又向左跨进了一大步，对坚决接受党的领导和走社会主义道路的认识又有了进一步的提高。这些进步完全是党对资产阶级知识分子团结、教育、改造政策的伟大胜利，是党的统一战线政策的伟大胜利，也是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们虽然有了很大的进步，但是从总的来说，资产阶级的政治立场，仍还没有得到根本的改造，两面性仍然存在，对党的领导和三面红旗仍还有不同程度的怀疑和动摇，有些人甚至还有抵触和不满情绪，在为社会主义服务的干劲方面，比之工农群众来说，还相差很远很远，因此，还需要继续努力进行政治立场和世界观的改造。我们向全国人民表示：一定要在党的领导下，认真地学习毛泽东思想，继续进行根本的自我改造，鼓足干劲、力争上游，投入技术革命和文化革命，更加积极地为社会主义服务，与全国人民一起为超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗，为高速度地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。
