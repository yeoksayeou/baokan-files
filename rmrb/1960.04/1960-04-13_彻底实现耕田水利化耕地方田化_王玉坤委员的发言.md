Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    I fully endorse the various reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I will resolutely implement them in accordance with the guiding spirit of the reports. The reports of the leaders and the speeches of the committee members have greatly enlightened me, and I also feel very happy. At present, the situation in our commune, like other parts of the country, is presenting a new scene of vigorous, comprehensive, and continuous leap forward. Now, I would like to give a brief report to the leaders and committee members on the production situation of the Nanwangzhuang People's Commune in Shenxian County over the past year, and the large-scale water conservancy construction to transform dry land into paddy fields, and the reform of the cultivation system to realize the standardization of cultivated land. If there is anything inappropriate, please point it out.

    In 1959, under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and on the basis of the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the vast number of members of the Nanwangzhuang People's Commune fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system and realized a continued Great Leap Forward. The total grain output increased by 26% compared with 1958; the total cotton output increased by 98%. The high-yield demonstration fields of the Nanwangzhuang Production Team had an average yield of 1,583 jin per mu for five mu of wheat, and an average yield of 1,300 jin for fifty mu. In 1957, our commune still needed grain from the state. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it became self-sufficient with a surplus. By 1959, although the cotton planting area was expanded, thanks to the victory of the continued Great Leap Forward, the grain output increased dramatically. In addition to being self-sufficient, we sold 6 million jin of grain to the state, transforming from a grain-deficient commune to a surplus-grain commune. The commune-run industry, transportation, culture and education, and public welfare undertakings have all developed rapidly. With the development of production, the living standards of the commune members have been greatly improved, and the average income of commune members increased by 25% in 1959 compared with 1958.

    In 1960, in order to leap forward better and achieve greater victories, we, in accordance with the central government's instruction on taking grain as the key link in agricultural production, and on the premise of ensuring increased grain production, simultaneously promoted agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and strived for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, put forward specific requirements for the planting area and output targets of various crops in accordance with the state plan. The planned average yield of grain per mu is 1,000 jin, which is twice that of 1959; the planned average yield of ginned cotton per mu is 110 jin, which is five times that of 1958. In order to successfully complete the various production tasks, a vigorous movement to achieve large-scale high-yield (1,000 jin of grain per mu), 100 (100 jin or 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, 500 to 600 jin of peanuts per mu), and 10,000 (10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu) has been launched among the vast number of commune members.

    Channels like a network, machine wells scattered, ensure seedlings in spring without rain, ensure a bumper harvest all year without rain
    Large-scale water conservancy construction is an important measure to ensure increased agricultural production. The Nanwangzhuang Commune has a total of 140,000 mu of land, of which 90,000 mu is irrigated land. In order to thoroughly realize "irrigation of farmland, network of irrigation canals, mechanization of water lifting, and standardization of high-standard fields," in the spirit of "unified planning, comprehensive utilization," "equal emphasis on construction, management, and use," "simultaneous use of surface water and groundwater," and "combined lifting irrigation and gravity irrigation," we have determined to focus on machine wells, with canals and wells complementing each other. On the basis of the water conservancy construction last winter, after this spring's hard work, there are now 262 machine wells and more than 1,000 brick-lined wells. This spring, 178 new branch, ditch, and capillary canals have been opened, with a total length of 118 kilometers, involving 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Together with the original three main canals, 18 branch canals, and 178 ditch and capillary canals, there are a total of 199 canals, with a total length of 650 kilometers, involving 2.44 million cubic meters of earthwork. Channels are like a network, machine wells are scattered, small areas are irrigated by well water, large areas are irrigated by canal water, ensuring seedlings in spring without rain, and ensuring a bumper harvest all year without rain, basically realizing irrigation of farmland, network of irrigation canals, and mechanization of water lifting, achieving double insurance for water conservancy. However, after the water conservancy construction plan for this spring was issued, some problems were encountered. Some commune members had "four fears" (fear of large projects, fear of using a lot of labor, fear of investment, and fear of not completing tasks), showing wavering and fear of difficulties. In response to this situation, we fully mobilized the masses, seized the question of "whether a bumper harvest can be guaranteed without water, and whether dry land can produce high yields," and conducted heated discussions. On the basis of raising awareness and unifying understanding, we launched a mass movement of "three contributions" (contributing ideas, suggestions, and materials, investing in accounting and repayment), "three selfs" (raising funds by ourselves, finding materials by ourselves, and learning technology by ourselves), and "three wants and three don'ts" (want to strengthen the Party's leadership; want to consult with the masses and follow the mass line; want to look downward; don't ask higher authorities for technicians; don't ask higher authorities for funds and materials; don't bow to difficulties) to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction. First, the Nanwangzhuang Production Team, which started with three poor peasant households sharing one and a half cow legs, had more than 500 commune members on the first day of the Lunar New Year, braving wind and snow and fighting severe cold, throwing themselves into the battle of digging wells and opening canals. They not only completed the task of two machine wells and three canals ahead of schedule, but also selected 24 strong commune members, carrying tools, to support production teams with fewer tools and poorer technical conditions to dig machine wells. A spirit of communist cooperation of helping the strong with the weak, helping the fast with the slow, and helping those with those without was launched throughout the commune. After two months of hard work, by now, 85% of the canals and wells have been completed, and the quality of the projects fully meets the requirements, reaching the standard of well completion, ground leveling, canal opening, and complete gate construction, achieving new results of irrigating more than 30,000 mu of land. With the expansion of the canals, large-scale gate culvert and standardized field projects were carried out. The commune built more than 180 level control projects at all levels, and a newly built hydroelectric power station has also begun construction, and 130,000 mu of cotton, grain, and oil crop land has been leveled and standardized, and ridge fields have been built. At the same time, with the renovation of the standardized fields, the east-west land was changed to north-south ridges, creating conditions for regionalized crop planting and large-scale standardization of fields. In order to transform the soil, large-scale alkali prevention projects were undertaken. Currently, three have been completed, transforming more than 80 mu of saline-alkali land.

    Large-scale standardization of fields, the basic construction projects such as square field canals, roads, wells, and factories have reached a complete set
    Large-scale standardization of fields, changing the cultivation system. In order to bring high yield to low yield and strive for high yield in every block, we, according to natural conditions, have divided 80% of the commune's 140,000 mu of cultivated land into "265 high-yield squares," including 27 cotton squares, 6 oil and grain squares, 30 sweet potato squares, and 45 miscellaneous grain squares. In terms of the size of the squares, there is one square of 20,000 mu, four squares of 10,000 mu, four squares of 2,000 mu, eleven squares of 1,000 mu, and eighty-one squares of less than 1,000 mu. In terms of the form of field standardization, we adopted two types: one is the large square jointly managed by various teams, with unified leadership, unified planning, unified indicators, unified measures, and unified actions; the teams operate independently, each responsible for its own profits and losses, and there are a total of 25 teams taking this form. The other is planting in squares by team, with the teams operating independently, and there are 20 teams like this. But regardless of the form, it must be emphasized that planting should be in accordance with the national plan and adapted to local conditions. Large-scale standardization of fields is a major reform in the agricultural cultivation system. Through this form of production, it can solve the phenomenon that some production teams in the past only focused on managing the nearby good land in cultivation, fertilization, and weeding, while neglecting the distant inferior land, thus causing some cultivated land to have low yields, and because the small teams were scattered in crop planting, it was not easy to guarantee the state planting plan. For this reason, the commune first used the example of the Nanwangzhuang and Yili production teams increasing cotton production by 150 jin per mu last year, and educated the vast number of commune members on the superiority of cultivating land in squares through comparison and accounting methods, and planned the southern cotton-suitable land of the commune into a 20,000-mu cotton sea, adopting the method of planning and constructing at the same time. First, make a sample, and the commune members see that the ground is as smooth as a mirror, so it is convenient to cultivate and there are many benefits, thus changing the past habit of being limited to small circles, and greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the commune members. At the same time, more than 10,000 commune members formed specialized teams for field standardization, taking the square as their home, eating and living in the fields, and carrying out production. At present, the basic construction projects such as square field canals, roads, wells, and factories have basically reached a complete set, 80% of the land has realized the standardization of cultivated land, spring irrigation preserves moisture, and sowing has begun according to the plan, and "five factories" (pig factory, fertilizer factory, feed processing factory, agricultural and sideline product processing factory, agricultural tool repair factory) "three stations" (technology, meteorology, tractor) enter the square, and "ten to the field" are realized. The commune has built 25 pig factories, fertilizer factories, etc. There is one technician per 100 mu, one technical team per 1,000 mu, and three stations for technology, meteorology, and tractors are set up per 10,000 mu. Realized the office, canteen, professional team, battle shed, supply and marketing, medical treatment, repair and assembly, study, entertainment, evaluation and comparison, etc., ten to the field. Combined with the planning of residential areas, the square fields are gradually becoming the center of rural politics, economy, culture, and life.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the square fields and adapt to the new situation of production development, the original management area and the square field committee were merged, with one set of people and two sets of organizations. Party general branch committees, management committees, Communist Youth League, women's federations, militia regiments and other departments were set up respectively. This reduces the leadership levels and resolves the contradiction of the original management area and the square field committee having dual leadership over the production square. In order to strengthen the strength of the production square, 50% of the Party members, Youth League members and mass activists were transferred to participate in the square field professional team. At the same time, the Party secretaries of the commune, management area, and production team also closely grasped the "four major fields of experiment, command, seed retention, and satellite" in the square, so as to combine politics into the square and work with production.

    Now, the vast number of members of our commune, under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are holding high the three red banners and advancing victoriously, striving to achieve greater victories in 1960.

    Let us join hands and advance shoulder to shoulder!

专栏：

    彻底实现耕田水利化耕地方田化
    王玉坤委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理和政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席所作的各项报告，并根据报告的指示精神，坚决贯彻执行。首长的报告和各位委员的发言，给了我很大启示，同时，也觉得非常高兴。目前，我们公社的形势和全国其他各地一样，到处呈现着一种生气勃勃，全面持续跃进的崭新的景象。现在，我仅就深县南王庄人民公社一年来的生产情况和大搞水利建设，变旱地为水田；改革耕作制度，实现耕地方田化的情况，向首长及各位委员，作一简要的汇报。如有不当之处，请指正。
    1959年，南王庄人民公社的广大社员，在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，在1958年大跃进的胜利基础上，充分地体现了人民公社制度的无比优越，实现了继续大跃进。粮食总产量比1958年增长26％；棉花总产量增长98％。南王庄生产队的高额丰产田，有五亩小麦平均亩产达到一千五百八十三斤，有五十亩平均产量为一千三百斤。1957年我们这个社还向国家要粮食吃哩，经过1958年的大跃进，变成了自给有余。到1959年，虽然棉花播种面积扩大，由于获得继续大跃进的胜利，粮食产量剧增，除自给外还卖给国家六百万斤粮食，由缺粮社变成了余粮社。社办工业、交通运输、文化教育和公共福利事业等，均有了迅速发展。随着生产的发展，社员生活水平得到大大提高，平均社员收入1959年比1958年增长了25％。
    1960年，我们为了跃进的更好，取得更大的胜利，根据中央农业生产以粮为纲，在保证粮食增产的前提下，农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举，争取农业全面大丰收的指示精神，按照国家计划，对各种农作物的种植面积和产量指标，都提出了具体要求。计划粮食平均亩产一千斤，比1959年提高二倍；棉花计划平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤，比1958年提高五倍。为了胜利地完成各项生产任务，全社广大社员中已掀起了轰轰烈烈地实现千（亩产千斤粮）、百（亩产皮棉一百斤、双百斤，花生亩产五百到六百斤）、万（亩产甘薯一万斤）大面积丰产运动。
    渠道如网，机井星罗棋布，春季无雨保全苗，全年无雨保丰收
    大搞水利建设，是保证农业增产的一项重要措施。南王庄公社共有土地十四万亩，其中水浇地有九万亩。我们为了彻底实现“农田水利化、灌溉渠网化、提水机械化、高标园田化”，本着“统一规划、综合利用”，“兴、修、管、使并重”，“地上水地下水并用”，“提水灌溉和自流灌溉兼施”的精神，确定以机井为主，渠、井并举。在去冬水利建设的基础上，经过今春奋战，现在已有机井二百六十二眼，砖洋井一千多眼；今春新开支、斗、毛渠一百七十八条，共长一百一十八公里，动土十三万立方。连同原有干渠三条、支渠十八条、斗毛渠一百七十八条共达一百九十九条，全长六百五十公里，动土二百四十四万立方，渠道如网，机井星罗棋布，小片井水浇，大面渠水灌，春季无雨保全苗，全年无雨保丰收，基本上实现了农田水利化、灌溉渠网化和提水机械化，达到了水利双保险。但是，在今春的水利建设计划下达后也曾经遇到一些问题，部分社员存有“四怕”（怕工程大、怕用工多、怕投资、怕完不成任务）思想，表现了动摇畏难情绪。针对这一情况，我们充分地发动群众，抓住“无水能否保丰收，旱地是否能高产”问题，进行了热烈讨论，在提高思想，统一认识的基础上，开展了群众性的“三献”（献计、献策、献物料，投资计账偿还）、“三自”（资金自己筹、物料自己找、技术自己学），“三要三不要”（要加强党的领导；要有事和群众商量，走好群众路线；要眼睛向下；不向上级要技术人员；不向上级要资金物料；不要向困难低头）的大搞水利建设运动。首先以三户贫农伙有一条半牛腿起家的南王庄生产队，大年初一就有五百多个社员，冒风雪、战严寒投入了打井、开渠战斗，他们不仅提前完成了二眼机井三条渠道任务，而且还抽出二十四个精壮社员，带着工具，支援工具少、技术条件较差的生产队去打机井。在全社范围内展开了强帮弱，快帮慢，有帮无的共产主义大协作的精神，经过二个月的苦干鏖战，到目前有85％的渠、井竣工，而且工程质量完全合乎要求，达到井成地平，渠通闸成工程配套的标准，获得了引水浇地三万多亩的新成绩。随着渠道的扩建，大搞闸涵和园田化工程，全社建了各级节制工程一百八十多处，新兴建的水利发电站也已开始施工，并将十三万亩棉粮油作物地进行了起高垫洼实现园田化和畦田化。同时，随着园田化的整修，把东西地改成南北畦，为作物种植区域化和大搞方田化创造了条件。为了改造土壤大抓防碱工程，目前修成三条，改造盐碱地八十多亩。
    大搞方田化，方田渠、路、井、厂等基本建设工程达到配套成龙
    大搞方田化，改变耕作制度。为了以高产带低产，争取块块高产化，我们根据自然条件，将全社十四万亩耕地的80％，分别划成“二百六十五个丰产方”，其中棉花方二十七个，油粮方六个，甘薯方三十个，杂粮方四十五个。从方的规模上看，双万亩的一个，万亩的四个，双千亩的四个，千亩的十一个，千亩以下八十一个。在搞方田化的形式上我们采取了二种：一种是：各队联合搞的大方，统一领导，统一规划，统一指标，统一措施，统一行动；分队经营，各负盈亏，采取这种形式的共二十五个队。另一种是：以队为单位划方种植，分队经营，这样的有二十个队。但不论那种形式都必须强调按着国家计划，因地制宜的种植。大搞方田化，是农业耕作制度上的重大改革，通过这种形式进行生产，可以解决过去某些生产队在耕作、施肥、中耕锄草只偏重于近地好地，而轻视远地次地的管理，因此造成某些耕地产量不高，和由于小队在作物种植上零散，不易保证国家种植计划的现象。为此，公社首先以总结南王庄、义里等生产队去年棉方每亩增产一百五十斤的实例，通过对比、算账的办法，向广大社员进行耕地方田化优越性的教育，并把全社南部宜棉土地规划成双万亩棉海，采取了边规划边施工的方法，首先搞出样板，社员一见地平如镜，这样耕作方便，好处多，从而改变了过去的只局限于小圈圈的习惯思想，大大鼓舞了社员干劲。同时，全社有万余名社员，组成搞方专业队，以方为家，食宿在田，进行生产。到目前，方田渠、路、井、厂等基本建设工程，已基本上达到配套成龙，有80％的土地实现了耕地园田化，春灌保墒，按着计划开始播种，并做到“五厂”（猪厂、肥厂、饲料加工厂、农副产品加工厂、农具修配厂）“三站”（技术、气象、拖拉机）进方，和“十到田”。全社已建成猪厂、肥料厂等二十五处。达到百亩一个技术员，千亩一个技术组，万亩设有技术、气象、拖拉机三站。实现了办公室，食堂，专业队，战棚，供销，医疗，修配，学习，文娱，评比等十到田。结合居民点规划，使方田逐步成为农村政治、经济、文化、生活的中心。
    为了加强方田的领导，以适应生产发展的新形势，原来的管理区和方田委员会合并，一套人马两套组织。分别设党总支委员会，管理委员会，青年团，妇联会，民兵团等部门组织。这样减少了领导层次，解决了原来管理区、方田委员会对生产方双重领导的矛盾。为加强生产方的力量，抽调了50％的党团员和群众积极分子，参加方田专业队。同时，公社、管理区、生产队三级党委书记也紧紧抓住了方内“试验，指挥，留种，卫星”四大田，达到政治进方，工作生产相结合。
    现在，我们社的广大社员，正在党的领导和在毛主席思想旗帜的指引下，高举三面红旗乘胜前进，为取得1960年的更大胜利而奋斗。
    让我们携起手来并肩前进吧！
