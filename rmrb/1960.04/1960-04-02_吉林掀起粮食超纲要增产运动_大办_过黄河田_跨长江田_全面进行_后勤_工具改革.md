(Reported by our newspaper from Changchun on April 1st) The rural situation in Jilin Province is extremely good. The scale of various spring plowing preparations and the successful commencement of some spring sowing work mark the entry of the province's agricultural front into a new stage of sustained leap forward.

The experience of two years of great leap forward and two years of bumper harvests has enabled the agricultural front in Jilin Province to further grasp the spirit of "early start is everything". This is a prominent feature of current agricultural production. The province's plowing preparation work began in the autumn of last year. At that time, people's communes in various regions, in conjunction with the autumn harvest, completed the task of deep plowing over 20 million mu of land, exceeding the quota by 21% in about thirty days. Subsequently, more than two million commune members were mobilized under the slogan of "fighting the dragon and demanding grain from manure", launching a winter production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation and production. Due to these works starting earlier than in previous years, various plowing preparation tasks were further achieved with greater, faster, better and more economical results, comprehensively and meticulously. Currently, the province is striving to overcome three barriers (soil, fertilizer, water) in terms of farmland capital construction. The first harrowing and pressing of deep-plowed land has been basically completed, and the second and third harrowing are in progress. Most of the deep-plowed land has been leveled. Manure accumulation has completed 129.8% of the original plan, with an average application rate of 37.5 tons per hectare, and over 90% has been delivered to the fields. Completed water conservancy projects have increased the benefited area by 4.35 million mu compared to last year. A large-scale water interception and impoundment movement, centered on intercepting peach blossom floods, has formed a high tide. Based on the requirements of reasonable close planting, the province's seeds have all been fully prepared, with a purity of over 90%.

Spring sowing work has also been advanced compared to previous years. Currently, the province has sown over 2.17 million mu of wheat, millet, and various oil crops suitable for early planting. This early and timely sowing of crops can change the past situation where concentrated spring sowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting caused excessive tension in manpower and animal power, leading to extensive cultivation. This facilitates the more meticulous implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and enhances cultivation techniques in the future.

Another characteristic marking the sustained leap forward in Jilin's agricultural production is the "three surpassings (surpassing agricultural production targets, surpassing animal husbandry targets, surpassing diversified economic production value), two catchings-up (poor management areas catching up with rich management areas, low-yield areas catching up with high-yield areas), and one improvement (increasing labor efficiency)" campaign sweeping across the province, driving various productions forward. Starting from early February, people's communes in various regions actively carried out the 1959 income distribution work and comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members. The money that should have been distributed was distributed to commune members on time, and food rations were also allocated to households according to targets. The dining halls were also rectified and consolidated. This further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of commune members, with attendance rates reaching over 90%. Subsequently, various regions started by mobilizing the masses, summarizing experiences, tapping the potential for increased production, and analyzing the favorable conditions for a sustained leap forward. They formulated leap forward targets and, on the basis of implementing the "three guarantees," quickly launched a production competition movement with the content of "three surpassings, two catchings-up, and one improvement" between communes, management areas, and production teams. People's communes in various regions mobilized over 1.3 million people to concentrate on accumulating manure, producing manure, delivering manure, and improving soil, launching a major offensive against low-yield fields. Currently, the province has transformed 6 million mu of various low-yield fields. At the same time, a surging "crossing the Yangtze River, crossing the Yellow River, surpassing targets" movement to vigorously develop "three fields" for increased production has emerged throughout the province. The area of "three fields" (i.e., "crossing the Yangtze River" fields, "crossing the Yellow River" fields, and "surpassing targets" fields) in Yongji County has reached over 50% of the grain and bean sown area. The broad masses of commune members actively add manure and pile fertilizer in the "three fields". In some communes in Jiutai County, the amount of fertilizer applied to the "three fields" has increased from the original 50 tons to over 70 tons. Various regions have also adopted the method of expanding cultivated land area through reclamation to ensure the realization of this year's sustained leap forward and to win the third bumper harvest after the people's communeization. According to preliminary statistics, the province can expand its cultivated land area by more than 4 million mu this year.

During the "three surpassings, two catchings-up, and one improvement" competition campaign, party committees at all levels organized over 10,000 cadres, led by secretaries, to go deep into backward areas and poor management areas and poor teams to strengthen leadership, thereby enabling these places to rapidly change their backward situation. According to incomplete statistics from counties such as Jiaohe, Da'an, Tao'an, and Yongji, more than 100 backward management areas and a large number of production teams entered the ranks of the advanced in plowing preparation and production.

The busy season for spring sowing in the province has arrived. Recently, party committees at all levels have successively organized inspection groups to go deep into the front line of production for inspection, pushing plowing preparation and spring sowing work to a new peak.

(Reported by our newspaper from Changchun on April 1st) A wave of mechanization and semi-mechanization with the reform of "logistics" tools as its content is spreading in more than 400 people's communes in Jilin Province. Rural "logistics" (including cooking, pig raising, and grain and grass processing) labor occupies a large amount of labor. In view of the characteristics of "logistics" tools being simple to manufacture, using few materials, having low costs, having quick results, and being easy to manufacture, various regions have reformed "logistics" tools on a large scale while reforming agricultural tools. Yongji County in the Jilin City area took the lead, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and feed processing, and partially realizing the semi-mechanization of cooking and pig-raising tools within two months. Soon, a mass innovation upsurge of "learning from Yongji, catching up with Yongji, and demanding labor from 'logistics' tools" was set off throughout the province. From cadres at all levels to the broad masses; from rural blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons to cooks, feeders, and ordinary commune members, everyone took action and everyone contributed ideas. Hundreds of thousands of people were involved in this movement. According to incomplete statistics, the province has reformed more than 100,000 "logistics" tools so far. 3,228 dining halls and 1,300 pig farms in the four regions of Jilin, Changchun, Tonghua, and Baicheng have basically achieved semi-mechanization, and 2,186 management areas have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and feed processing. From rice milling and flour grinding to the kitchen's cutting vegetables, washing vegetables, washing rice, washing dishes, and water supply; from feed crushing to the pig farm's feeding, water supply, and manure transportation, all the way to the pen door switch, there are various mechanized and semi-mechanized tools.

In the past, the province required 360,000 strong laborers to engage in "logistics" work all year round. One cook served 30 to 40 people, and one feeder raised 20 to 30 pigs, resulting in very low labor efficiency. After "logistics" labor changed from manual operation to mechanization and semi-mechanization, labor efficiency increased several times, with one person replacing several people's work. According to surveys of some people's communes in Yongji, Yushu, and the suburban areas of Changchun, the ratio of dining hall cooks to diners has increased from 1:30 to 1:60-80 after the reform of cooking and pig-raising tools, and the average number of pigs raised by each feeder has increased from 20 to 80-100. Due to the reform of 38,000 "logistics" tools in the two regions of Changchun and Jilin, more than 50,000 laborers and more than 30,000 animal power have been liberated to participate in spring plowing production. It is estimated that after basically realizing the semi-mechanization of "logistics" operations by the end of the year, the proportion of laborers engaged in "logistics" work to the total rural labor force will drop from over 15% to about 7%. The contradiction between the province's large land area, small population, and insufficient labor force will be further alleviated.

    吉林掀起粮食超纲要增产运动
    大办“过黄河田”“跨长江田”  全面进行“后勤”工具改革
    本报长春1日电　吉林省农村形势极为良好，各项备耕工作的规模和部分春播工作的胜利开展，标志着全省农业战线已进入持续跃进的新阶段。
    两年大跃进，两年大丰收的经验，使吉林省农业战线上进一步掌握了一早百早的精神。这是当前农业生产中突出的特点。全省的备耕工作去年秋季即已开始。当时各地人民公社结合秋收，三十天左右便超额21％完成了二千多万亩深翻地任务。接着，又出动了二百多万名社员，在“与蛟龙开战，向粪肥要粮”的口号下，开展了以兴修水利和积肥造肥为中心的冬季生产运动。由于这些工作比往年提前，各项备耕工作进一步达到了多快好省，全面细致。目前，全省在农田基本建设方面正在为闯过三关（土、肥、水）而努力。深翻地的头遍耙压工作基本结束，二遍，三遍正在进行，大部分深翻地已经整平。积肥完成了原计划的129.8％，平均每公顷施肥量可达三十七点五吨，90％以上已送进地里，已完成的水利工程，受益面积比去年增加四百三十五万亩，以拦截桃花水为中心的大拦、大堵的蓄水灌田运动已形成高潮。根据合理密植的要求，全省种子已全部备足，纯度达90％以上。
    春播工作也比往年提前。现在，全省已播下适合早种的小麦、谷子和各种油料作物等二百一十七万多亩。这些作物提前适时播种，可以改变过去因春季集中播种，夏季集中铲趟，秋季集中收割所造成的人力，畜力过分紧张和由此带来的耕作粗放现象，便于今后更加细致地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高耕作技术。
    标志着吉林农业生产持续跃进的另一特点，是席卷全省的“三超（农业超包产，畜牧业超指标，多种经营超产值），两赶（穷管理区赶富管理区，低产区赶高产区），一提高（劳动效率提高）”的竞赛运动，推动着各项生产不断向前发展。从2月初开始，各地人民公社积极进行1959的收益分配工作，全面安排了社员生活。将应该分配的钱款按时分到社员手中，口粮按指标也落实到户，对食堂也进行了整顿巩固工作。从而，进一步激发了社员的劳动积极性，出勤率达到90％以上。接着，各地都从发动群众，总结经验，挖掘增产潜力和分析持续跃进的有利条件入手，订出跃进指标，在“三包”落实的基础上，迅速掀起以“三超、两赶、一提高”为内容的社与社，管理区与管理区，生产队与生产队之间的生产竞赛运动。各地人民公社出动一百三十多万人突击积肥、造肥、送肥、改良土壤，向低产田大举进军。目前，全省已改造各种低产田六百万亩。与此同时，全省又出现了一个汹涌澎湃的“跨长江、过黄河，超纲要”的大搞“三田”的增产运动。永吉县的“三田”（即“跨长江”田、“过黄河”田、“超纲要”田）面积已达到粮豆播种面积的50％以上。广大社员积极往“三田”地里加趟加堆的增施粪肥。九台县部分公社“三田”的施肥量已由原来的五十吨增加到七十吨以上。各地还采取开荒扩大耕地面积来保证实现今年的持续跃进，夺取人民公社化后的第三个大丰收。据初步统计，全省今年可扩大耕地面积四百多万亩。
    在“三超、两赶、一提高”的竞赛运动中，各级党委组织万余名干部，由书记挂帅，深入到落后地区和穷管理区、穷队加强领导，因而，使这些地方迅速改变了落后面貌。据蛟河、大安、洮安、永吉等县不完全的统计，在备耕生产中就有一百多个落后管理区和大量的生产队跨入了先进行列。
    全省春播大忙季节已经到来，最近，各级党委纷纷组织检查团，深入生产第一线进行检查，把备耕和春播工作推向新的高峰。
    本报长春1日电　以改革“后勤”工具为内容的机械化半机械化浪潮，正在吉林省四百多个人民公社中扩展开来。农村“后勤”（包括炊事，养猪和粮草加工）劳动占用着大量的劳动力。鉴于“后勤”工具有制造简单、用料少、成本低、收效快、容易制造的特点，各地就在农具改革运动的同时，大改“后勤”工具。吉林市地区的永吉县一马当先，两个月就基本上实现了粮米、饲料加工机械化、半机械化，炊事和养猪工具部分的实现了半机械化。不久，全省掀起了“学永吉、赶永吉、向‘后勤’工具要劳力”群众革新高潮。从各级干部到广大群众；从农村的铁匠、木匠、石匠到炊事员、饲养员和一般社员，人人动手、个个献计。数百万人卷入这一运动。据不完全统计，目前全省已改革的“后勤”工具达十万余件。吉林、长春、通化、白城四个地区有三千二百二十八个食堂和一千三百个养猪场基本实现了半机械化，二千一百八十六个管理区实现了粮米或饲料加工机械化半机械化。从碾米磨面到食堂的切菜、洗菜、淘米、洗碗、供水；从饲料粉碎到养猪场的送食、供水、运粪一直到圈门开关，都有了各式各样的机械化、半机械化工具。
    过去全省常年要有三十六万强劳力从事“后勤”工作。一名炊事员服务三、四十人，一名饲养员养猪二、三十头，劳动效率很低。“后勤”劳动由手工操作变为机械化半机械化之后，劳动效率成倍提高，一人代替几个人工作。仅永吉、榆树和长春市郊区部分人民公社调查，炊具和养猪工具改革后，食堂炊事员与用饭人员的比例已由过去的一比三十提高到一比六十至八十，养猪员每人平均养猪由过去的二十头提高到八十头至一百头。长春、吉林两个地区由于改革了“后勤”工具三万八千件，已解放出五万多劳力和三万多头畜力参加了春耕生产。预计全省在年末基本实现“后勤”操作半机械化以后，从事“后勤”工作的劳动力占农村劳力总数的比重，将由15％以上，降到7％左右。全省地多人少劳力不足的矛盾将进一步得到缓和。
