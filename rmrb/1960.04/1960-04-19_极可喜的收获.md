A high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong is developing vigorously among the workers and peasants. We can see from the philosophical essays written by workers recently published in the newspapers that this study movement has already had extremely gratifying results, how deep this study movement is, and how significant it is for accelerating socialist construction.

The Wenhui Daily published a special collection of "Worker Essays" (all philosophical essays) on April 9th, publishing nine articles written by Shanghai workers. As the editors said, these articles have a common characteristic of "vigorous vitality, clear viewpoints, …linking theory with practice and solving problems." What is the quality of these articles? All very good. They use philosophical principles to explain practical problems, solve practical problems, and use vivid facts to illustrate philosophical principles. In this way, philosophical principles are brought to life, speaking vividly and combatively.

For example, there is the comrade Zhou Zhimei, a worker in the turbine workshop of the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard, wrote "Balance and Imbalance." This short essay of about a thousand words uses vivid facts to illustrate the great truth that balance and imbalance are a unity of opposites, and in particular, it links this truth with bringing subjective initiative into play and striving for leaps forward and more leaps forward. He said: "Our workshop's production, every month, formulates plans based on the specific circumstances of existing equipment, materials, labor, etc. The plan looks balanced, but when it is put into practice, due to changes in subjective and objective conditions, imbalances often arise between this section and that section," "For example, in the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the comrades doing fitter work are soaring with enthusiasm, throwing backward tools into museums, and manual operations have become mechanized operations, while other sections cannot completely match the speed and effect of the fitter's technological innovations," so "the old balance of mutual cooperation between sections has been broken, and the most prominent contradiction in the workshop is that the metal processing cannot keep up with the needs of the fitter assembly." What to do? Comrade Zhou Zhimei replied: From imbalance to balance, "people need to bring into play their subjective initiative to organize." Then he criticized the passive view of asking to "add equipment, increase personnel, and adjust the ratio of metal processing and fitter work"; he said: "The most fundamental way is for metal processing to catch up immediately, to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale, so that the production of its own section is balanced with that of the fitter, and then to surpass them later… to create a new imbalance, prompting others to catch up." He also summarized: "Continuous development of production always goes from imbalance to balance and then to new imbalance," "Balance and imbalance cycle endlessly, enabling our production to leap forward and then leap forward again."

Let us comrades engaged in philosophical work take a look: How well did Comrade Zhou Zhimei speak? Are not some of the pamphlets or papers on balance and imbalance written by our philosophical workers, which are tens of thousands of words long, not as clear as this short essay of a thousand words written by Comrade Zhou Zhimei? Are not some of them far-fetched and vulgarized when linking with reality? Does Comrade Zhou Zhimei's article have this problem? No. Do not some of the works of our philosophical workers have more or less a tendency to limit themselves to explaining the world? And Zhou Zhimei's short essay, however, explains the truth of using the law of motion of "balance and imbalance," bringing subjective initiative into play, and striving for leaps forward and more leaps forward. Although it can be said that his exposition has not been fully developed, it must be admitted that it truly embodies the fundamental characteristics of the combativeness and revolutionary nature of Marxist philosophy!

The Guangming Daily's 236th Philosophy Special also published two articles by workers. One is "Human Effort Determines Everything" by Peng Jilin, a young worker in Wuhan; the other is "On the Issue of Human Subjective Initiative" by Li Jingshan, a young worker in Zhaozhou Printing Factory. Comrade Peng Jilin's article uses practical examples to illustrate the relationship between subjective initiative and objective laws, "They are contradictory and unified. We recognize objective conditions, but we can fully understand, master, and utilize objective conditions." He criticized the negative conclusions drawn from "A clever housewife cannot cook without rice." The sentence "A clever housewife cannot cook without rice" is correct in a certain sense, but different people will draw different conclusions from this sentence: the lazy and the cowardly say, since there is no rice, don't cook; the revolutionaries say, the meal must be cooked, and if there is no rice, go to farm. Comrade Peng Jilin criticized the lazy and cowardly thoughts hidden under the sentence "A clever housewife cannot cook without rice." He said, "If there are no materials, find them yourself; if there is no equipment, make it yourself," this is the "true clever housewife of the heroic era." Comrade Li Jingshan's article on subjective initiative starts with the primacy of matter and the secondary nature of consciousness, but he did not stop there. He used vivid examples to illustrate that "if we understand objective reality and master objective laws, we can fully bring subjective initiative into play." He said, "The subjective must conform to the objective, but it does not mean that the subjective must be a slave to the objective." Objective conditions "are not immutable. As long as we bring subjective initiative into play and are willing to study and work hard, we can fully utilize favorable conditions and limit the role of unfavorable conditions," and even "turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions."

Comrades, look, how are the articles by Comrades Peng Jilin and Li Jingshan? Are they not explaining the truth very clearly and practically? Are they not without the one-sidedness of some philosophical workers' pamphlets that only talk about thinking as a reflection of existence and objective reality determining the subjective?

It is really gratifying to read the philosophical papers of worker comrades. This is a great happy event. Why is it said to be a great happy event? Because the publication of philosophical papers by workers is a new thing that has never happened in the history of our country. This is a great boost to the ambition of the working class. But it is not only that, but more importantly because: (1) From these papers, we see the depth of the mass study movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. In our country, the publication of philosophical papers by workers will become a common and regular thing. This great popularization of Marxism is a popularization at a rather high level. Moreover, we can expect that a large number of excellent Marxist "scholars" will emerge from the masses. (2) The philosophical papers of workers bring us a fresh breeze, which will have a great impact on the style of being divorced from reality and bookishness existing among some philosophical workers, forcing people to change their study style. (3) From the philosophical papers of workers, it can be seen that the theoretical study of the broad masses will greatly promote the great leap forward in socialist economic construction. The "wind" of theoretical study will help the "waves" of the great leap forward, which will make our work a greater leap forward, one wave higher than another. And the great leap forward in economic construction will be directly summarized by the "scholars" of the workers and peasants, promoting the great development of theoretical research.

A higher high tide of mass philosophy study than in 1958 has arrived. It is the prelude to a comprehensive leap forward in theoretical work! It will have an extremely profound impact on our economic life and ideological life! This is a new victory for Marxism-Leninism in our country! This victory will be rapidly expanded and developed!

Can philosophical workers be indifferent to this matter? Can they close their doors and engage in their so-called "improvement"? No, they should humbly learn from the masses and enthusiastically help the masses learn.

Of course, I am not saying that the philosophical papers of workers are already at the top and have no shortcomings. If I said that, the workers would criticize: you are too metaphysical. They need to be constantly improved. Philosophical workers, at least, have more philosophical knowledge. The workers and peasants need their help. But, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: To be a teacher of the masses, you must first be a student of the masses. The same is true in this matter. We should first humbly learn from the masses, and then guide popularization, and improve on the basis of popularization. In the process of humbly learning from the masses and enthusiastically helping the masses learn, philosophical workers will further correct their study style, learn to link with reality more skillfully, thoroughly eliminate the problem of being far-fetched, and further appreciate the combativeness and revolutionary nature of dialectical materialism. In this way, it will certainly greatly strengthen our philosophical research work.

    极可喜的收获
    关锋
    在工农群众中，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的高潮，正在蓬蓬勃勃的发展。我们仅从近来报纸上发表的工人写的哲学论文，就可以看到这个学习运动已经有了极为可喜的收获，看到这个学习运动是多么深入，它对于加速社会主义建设有多么重大的意义。
      4月9日的文汇报，出了一个《工人论文选》（都是哲学论文）特辑，发表了上海工人写的九篇文章。正如编者所说，这些文章具有“蓬勃的朝气，鲜明的观点，……联系实际而又解决问题”这样一个共同的特点。这些文章，质量怎样？都很好。它们用哲学原理说明实际问题、解决实际问题，又用活生生的事实阐明哲学原理。这样，就把哲学道理讲活了，讲得很有生气，很有战斗性。
    例如，上海求新造船厂轮机车间工人周志美同志的“平衡与不平衡”。这篇千把字的短文，用生动的事实，说明了平衡和不平衡是对立的统一这个大道理，特别是还把这个道理和发挥主观能动性联系起来，争取跃进再跃进。他说：“我们车间的生产，每一个月都根据现有的设备、材料、人力等等具体情况安排制定计划。从计划看起来，是平衡的，可是付诸实行时，由于主客观情况的变化，往往就会出现这个工段与那个工段产生了不平衡的情况”，“像在当前的技术革新、技术革命运动中，做钳工的同志干劲冲天，把落后工具丢进了博物馆，手工操作变成了机械操作，而其他工段不可能和钳工的技术革新的速度和效果完全一样”，于是“各工段相互配合的旧的平衡就被打破了，车间里产生了最突出的金加工跟不上钳工装配需要的矛盾”。怎么办呢？周志美同志答复说：从不平衡到平衡，“需要人们发挥主观能动作用去组织”，接着他批判了要求“添置设备，增加人员，调整金加工和钳工的比例”那种消极观点；他说：“最根本的办法是金加工立即赶上去，大搞技术革新和技术革命，使自己工段的生产与钳工相平衡，然后再来个后来居上……造一个新的不平衡，促使别人来赶自己。”他还概括的说：“生产不断的发展，总是从不平衡到平衡再到新的不平衡”，“平衡与不平衡循环不已，使我们生产不断跃进再跃进”。
    我们这些搞哲学工作的同志看看：周志美同志讲得怎么样？我们哲学工作者写的长达几万字的、关于平衡和不平衡的小册子或论文，不是有的还不如周志美同志写这篇千把字的短文讲的清楚吗？不是有的联系实际弄得牵强附会、庸俗化吗？周志美同志的文章有这个毛病吗？没有。我们哲学工作者的作品，不是有的多多少少有点限于说明世界的倾向吗？而周志美这篇短文，却说明了利用“平衡和不平衡”这一运动规律、发挥主观能动性、争取跃进再跃进的道理。尽管可以说，他的论述还没有充分展开，但是却不能不承认它切实地体现了马克思主义哲学的战斗性、革命性这个根本特色吧！
    光明日报第236期哲学专刊，也发表了两篇工人的文章。一篇是武汉市青年工人彭吉林的“事在人为”；一篇是肇州印刷厂青年工人李景山的“关于人的主观能动作用问题”。彭吉林同志的文章，用实际事例说明主观能动作用和客观规律的关系，“它们之间是对立的，又是统一的。我们承认客观条件，但是我们完全可以认识、掌握和利用客观条件。”他批判了从“巧妇难做无米炊”引出的消极结论。“巧妇难做无米炊”这句话，在一定意义上是对的，但是不同的人却会从这句话引出不同的结论：懒汉和懦夫说，既然没有米，就不要做饭吧；革命者却说，饭一定要做，没有米就去种田。彭吉林同志批判了在“巧妇难做无米炊”这句话掩盖下的懒汉和懦夫思想。他说：“没材料就自己找，没设备就自己搞”，这才是“英雄时代真巧妇”。李景山同志的谈主观能动作用的文章，从物质第一性、意识第二性说起，但是他并没有停顿在这里，他用生动事例说明我们“认识了客观实际，掌握了客观规律，就可以充分发挥主观能动性”。他说：“主观必须符合客观，但不是说，主观必须做客观的奴隶”，客观条件“并不是一成不变的，只要发挥了主观能动作用，肯钻肯干，就可以充分利用有利条件，限制不利条件的作用”，以至“把不利条件变为有利条件”。
    同志们，你看，彭吉林和李景山同志的文章怎样？他们不是把道理讲得很清楚、很实际吗？不是没有像某些哲学工作者写的小册子只讲思维是存在的反映、客观决定主观的那种片面性吗？
    读了工人同志的哲学论文，实在令人高兴。这是一件大喜事。为什么说它是大喜事？因为工人发表哲学论文，是我国历史上不曾有过的新事。这是大长工人阶级的志气的事。但不仅是这样，更重要的是因为：（一）从这些论文中，使我们看到了学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志著作这个群众性学习运动的深入。工人发表哲学论文，在我们国家里将要变成寻常的、经常的事情。这个马克思主义的大普及是在相当高的水平上的普及。而且，我们可以预计：从群众中会涌现出大批优秀的马克思主义的“秀才”。（二）工人的哲学论文，给我们吹来了一股清新的风，它将对在部分哲学工作者中间存在着的脱离实际的作风、书生气，给以很大的冲激，迫使人们不得不转变学风。（三）从工人的哲学论文可以看出：广大群众的理论学习会大大地推动社会主义经济建设的大跃进。理论学习之“风”助大跃进之“浪”，将使我们的工作更大跃进，一浪高过一浪。而经济建设的大跃进，又将直接经过工农群众的“秀才”们的手加以总结，推动理论研究大发展。
    一个比1958年群众学哲学更高的高潮，已经到来了。它是理论工作全面大跃进的先声！它将在我国经济生活、思想生活中发生极其深刻的影响！这是马克思列宁主义在我国获得的一个新的胜利！这个胜利，将得到迅速的扩大和发展！
    难道，哲学工作者对这件事可以漠不关心吗？可以关死门搞自己的所谓“提高”吗？不，应该虚心地向群众学习，并热情地帮助群众学习。
    当然，我不是说工人的哲学论文已经好到顶了，已经没有任何缺点了。如果那样说，工人会批评道：你太形而上学了。他们需要不断提高。哲学工作者，至少哲学知识是比较多的。工农群众需要他们的帮助。但是，正如毛泽东同志所说：要做群众的先生，必须先做群众的学生。在这件事情上也是一样，我们应该首先向群众虚心学习，才能指导普及，在普及的基础上提高。哲学工作者在虚心向群众学习和热情帮助群众学习中，会进一步端正学风，学会更熟练地联系实际，把那种牵强附会的毛病彻底清除，更进一步地体会辩证唯物主义的战斗性和革命性。这样，当然会大大地加强我们的哲学研究工作。
