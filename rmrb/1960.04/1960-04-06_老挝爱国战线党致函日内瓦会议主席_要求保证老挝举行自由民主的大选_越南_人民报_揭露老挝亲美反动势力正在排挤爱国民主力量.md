Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 5th: According to "Lao Patriotic News," the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the Soviet Union and Great Britain—requesting the resumption of activities of the International Commission for Laos as soon as possible, and intervening in the Lao Royal Government to guarantee free and democratic elections on April 24, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, the Vientiane Agreements, and the Constitution of the Kingdom of Laos. It also requested the cessation of the civil war and the release of Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The letter, signed by Phay Dang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, pointed out that the American imperialists and the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are colluding to undermine the last foundations of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements by all means. They are attempting to use the upcoming elections to realize their plans. This reactionary plan includes: forcibly dissolving the National Assembly; abolishing the previous electoral law and declaring a new reactionary electoral law to deprive the broad masses of the people of their democratic rights; at the same time, intensifying the bloody suppression and "sweeps" of the people throughout the country, especially in Lower Laos; and finally, staging an "election" farce with bayonets and other instruments of repression.

The letter emphasized that the Lao Patriotic Front is loyal to the interests of the Lao people, adheres to the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and adheres to the policy of national unity, peace, and neutrality of the former Lao fighting forces. Despite the arbitrary actions taken by the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," in order to once again demonstrate the desire for peace and national cooperation, the Lao Patriotic Front representatives, on behalf of their leaders and a number of party members who have been detained for more than eight months, have nominated themselves as candidates for the general election in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the Royal Government. However, all these requests to participate in the election have been met with discrimination.

The letter finally requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to propose effective measures to ensure strict compliance with the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

The same letter has also been delivered to the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, the chairman state of the International Control and Supervision Commission for Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 5th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today condemning the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" for violating the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, manipulating the National Assembly elections, and attempting to create a National Assembly that would execute the will of American imperialism. The commentary demanded that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the Prime Minister of India, the chairman state of the International Commission, take measures to promptly stop the situation in Laos from continuing to develop in a dangerous direction.

The commentary said that among the one hundred and fifty-two candidates who have been announced, the majority are members of the two pro-American parties that control the Lao regime, namely the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and the "Lao People's United Party" headed by Phoui Sananikone. Due to the Lao authorities' discriminatory policies and their anti-democratic election regulations, which are aimed at excluding patriotic and progressive people from the elections, the Lao Patriotic Front has only nine candidates, and the Lao Committee for Peace and Neutrality has only ten candidates. Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, who are still being illegally imprisoned, have not been able to participate in the election. The commentary pointed out that this is a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, which stipulate that the Lao government must guarantee the democratic freedoms of all Lao citizens and former resistance personnel.

The commentary also said that the extremely reactionary heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," colluding with the Phoui Sananikone group, have agreed on how to divide the seats in the Lao National Assembly in order to create a tool of military dictatorship to carry out the will of American imperialism.

The commentary revealed that these reactionary heads, on the eve of the election, also mobilized four mobile regiments under the guise of "exercises" to carry out "sweeps" in the provinces of Lower Laos, brutally persecuting the people. They coordinated with the "sweeps" carried out by more than 10,000 troops of the Ngo Dinh Diem army in the Vietnamese-Lao border area, and used the so-called "elimination of rebellion" methods taught to them by personnel sent by the Malayan government, wantonly killing, looting, and persecuting patriotic people.

The commentary emphasized that "through financial and military aid, American imperialism directly participated in the heinous crimes of its running dogs. Under the pretext of supporting the elections, American imperialism recently sent helicopters from the Seno military base for these running dogs to use in the 'sweeps' in Lower Laos."

The commentary pointed out that the actions of the pro-American reactionary group in Laos on the eve of the election make it clear that this so-called election will only be a fraudulent action, a vote carried out under the point of bayonets.

    老挝爱国战线党致函日内瓦会议主席
    要求保证老挝举行自由民主的大选
    越南“人民报”揭露老挝亲美反动势力正在排挤爱国民主力量
    据新华社河内5日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席——苏联和英国，要求在尽可能短的时间内恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，并且对老挝王国政府进行干预，以保证按照日内瓦协议和万象协议以及老挝王国的宪法在4月24日举行自由和民主的大选。它还要求停止内战，释放苏发努冯和老挝爱国战线党的其他领袖。
    这封由老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席费当签署的信指出，美帝国主义者和老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目勾结，正在用一切手段破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的最后基础。他们正企图利用即将举行的选举来实现他们的计划。这个反动的计划包括：用武力解散国民议会；废除以前的选举法，宣布新的反动的选举法，以剥夺广大人民的民主权利；同时，加紧对全国各地、特别是对下寮人民的血腥镇压和“扫荡”；最后，用刺刀和其他镇压工具表演“选举”丑剧。
    这封信强调说，老挝爱国战线党忠于老挝人民的利益，恪守日内瓦协议和万象协议，并且恪守前寮国战斗部队的民族团结、和平和中立的政策。尽管“保卫国家利益委员会”的领导人采取了专横的行动，但是，为了再一次表明和平和全国合作的愿望，老挝爱国战线党代表迄今已被拘禁八个多月的它的领袖和若干党员，按照王国政府颁布的法律和条例，提出他们作为参加大选的候选人。但是，所有这些参加竞选的要求都遭受到歧视。
    这封信最后要求日内瓦会议两位主席提出有效的措施，以确保严格遵守日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    同样的信，也已经交给了老挝国际监察和监督委员会的主席国——印度共和国政府总理尼赫鲁。
    新华社河内5日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，谴责老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们违反日内瓦协议和万象协议，操纵国民议会选举，企图制造一个执行美帝国主义意旨的国民议会。评论要求日内瓦会议的两位主席和国际委员会主席国印度的总理采取措施，及时制止老挝局势继续向危险的方向发展。
    评论说，在已经宣布的一百五十二名候选人中，大部分是掌握着老挝政权的两个亲美党派，即“保卫国家利益委员会”和以培·萨纳尼空为首的“老挝人联合党”的人员。由于老挝当局的歧视政策和他们制定的反民主的、目的在于把爱国和进步人士从选举当中排挤出去的选举条例，老挝爱国战线党只有九名候选人，老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会也只有十名候选人。仍被非法监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人没有能够参加竞选。评论指出，这是明目张胆地违反规定老挝政府必须保证老挝一切公民和前抗战人员的民主自由的日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。
    评论还说，极端反动的“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们勾结培·萨纳尼空集团，已经商妥如何瓜分老挝国民议会席位，以制造一个军事独裁政权的工具来执行美帝国主义的意旨。
    评论揭露，这些反动头目们在选举前夕还打着“演习”的招牌出动了四个机动兵团在下寮各省展开了“扫荡”，野蛮地迫害人民。他们同吴庭艳军队一万多人在越老边界地带进行的“扫荡”配合起来，并且使用由马来亚政府派到老挝的人员向他们传授的所谓“消灭叛乱”的方式，大肆残杀、抢劫和迫害爱国人民。
    评论强调指出，“通过金钱和武装的援助，美帝国主义直接参与了它的走狗的滔天罪行。美帝国主义以支援选举为借口，最近又从塞诺军事基地派来直升飞机，供这些走狗在下寮的‘扫荡’中使用。”
    评论指出，老挝的亲美反动集团，在选举前夕的行动，使人们看透了这种所谓选举只会是舞弊行动，只会是在刺刀尖下进行的投票。
