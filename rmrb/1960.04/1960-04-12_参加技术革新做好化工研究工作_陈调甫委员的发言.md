I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 Draft National Budget."

Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, chemical research institutions, like other scientific research institutions, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party, have seen their staff display soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, making rapid progress with the bold posture of riding the wind and waves, creating countless earth-shattering achievements. On this basis, 1959 saw an even greater leap forward. This year (1960), encouraged by past achievements, all aspects have increased confidence, strengthened courage, and made full use of favorable conditions. The first quarter achieved a good start, a full house of red, and red every month, red to the end. The work of general chemical research institutions has more than doubled, even several times over last year, completing and exceeding plans ahead of schedule. The situation is excellent. We can say without hesitation that 1960 will see record-breaking, bigger, and extraordinary great leaps forward.

With past experience, future victories can be guaranteed. Our success is assured, and our task is glorious and arduous. Under these circumstances of continuous encouragement and high morale, it is necessary to reorganize our forces and strengthen our combat power. Now, based on my personal experience, I will briefly describe a few points that should be paid attention to in further strengthening and improving chemical research work. These opinions are very immature, and I ask for criticism and correction from all committee members and comrades.

	I. Chemical Research Work Requires Putting Politics in Command and the Party's Strong Leadership

"Of all things, the Party's leadership is the most important." With the Party's leadership, chemical research work can determine a clear direction, specific goals, main tasks, and the principles, policies, and measures for achieving various tasks, based on the needs of our country's current socialist construction. In other words, business must be commanded by politics in order to achieve rapid development, create miracles, and serve socialist construction. Without the Party's leadership, losing direction and the soul, nothing can be accomplished.

The victory of chemical research work in the Great Leap Forward was due to the Party's correct leadership. Even greater and more comprehensive victories in the future require even stronger Party leadership. The vast majority of chemical researchers, like other scientific workers, are deeply convinced of this point after receiving education from the Anti-Rightist Struggle and rectification movement. However, there are still some bourgeois intellectuals in our science and technology ranks who, although they have made some slight progress in recent years, still need to strengthen their transformation, strengthen their self-transformation in active service, wholeheartedly obey the Party's leadership, and strive to become both red and expert scientific and technological workers. In short, the Party's leadership is the fundamental foundation, the core of the core, and all work cannot be separated from the Party's leadership.

	II. The Mass Line is the Most Effective Method

The mass line is a basic method that is effective in all the Party's work. The wisdom of the masses is infinite, the strength of the masses is incomparably great, the experience of the masses is rich and colorful, and the methods thought of by the masses are practical and feasible for the current local situation. Therefore, by relying on the masses, we can travel a thousand miles a day; by deviating from the masses, we cannot move an inch. We must closely rely on the masses, liberate ourselves from the ivory tower of the laboratory, throw ourselves into the vigorous practice of the broad masses, and constantly learn from and consult the masses to enrich our experience and correct our mistakes. What is especially important is to eat, live, and labor with the masses, put down the airs of "experts," not count rewards for merits, be brave in admitting mistakes, not be afraid of criticism, and not be afraid of losing face, so that we can truly become one with the masses, twist into one rope, and cooperate wholeheartedly to serve socialist construction.

Researchers should further open up their own bits of experience and strength completely and dissolve them into the vast ocean of mass strength. In this way, they can play a role to some extent. If there are suggestions, they should not stop at the stage of oral or written expression, but should do it themselves, try every possible means to operate with the masses, and conduct on-site experiments, so that they can quickly make achievements and climb the peak of science.

Chemical research institutions have workers, cadres, and young and old scientific and technological workers. All aspects should be closely integrated under the leadership of the Party, helping and encouraging each other, learning from each other's strengths, working together, and moving forward hand in hand. If everyone becomes a member of the masses, infinite potential can be easily unleashed.

	III. Liberate Thought, Break Down Superstition, and Establish the Communist Style of Dare to Think, Dare to Speak, and Dare to Act

To do a good job in chemical research work, every employee must first liberate their thinking and break down superstition. It is not easy for some bourgeois intellectuals to liberate their thinking, and they often commit a series of superstitions, such as superstition in books, superstition in established rules, superstition in experience, and so on. With one of these, it is easy to commit the ills of subjectivity, one-sidedness, right-leaning, and passive waiting, unable to muster energy, unable to unleash potential, out of step with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, unsuited to it, and even less able to establish the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act.

One of the best ways to liberate thinking is to go out of the laboratory to participate in production practice in factories in order to break the limitations of "sitting in a well and watching the sky" and the old concept of "scholars do not go out, but know everything under heaven."

Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice": "If you want to directly know something or some things, you can only touch the phenomena of that or those things by personally participating in the struggle of changing reality and changing something or some things, and only by personally participating in the struggle of changing reality can you expose the essence of that or those things and understand them. This is the path of cognition that anyone actually takes, but some people deliberately distort it and say some opposing words."

	IV. Combine Practical Research with Theoretical Research

Theory comes from practice and, in turn, can guide practice.

Since the Great Leap Forward, all aspects have put forward a large number of new problems, requiring theoretical solutions. Various advanced experiences in industrial and agricultural production need to be explained theoretically in order to further guide practice. All results of practical research can only give us perceptual knowledge, and we must develop to rational knowledge through theoretical research in order to establish the results of research on a solid foundation without committing the mistakes of "empiricism."

Chairman Mao clearly instructed us in "On Practice": "To completely reflect the entire thing, to reflect the essence of things, to reflect the internal laws of things, it is necessary to go through the action of thinking, to transform and create the rich perceptual materials by discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and proceeding from the outside to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories, it is necessary to leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge."

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said at the National Congress of Heroes in 1959: "In order to develop technology, develop productive forces, and develop our country's science and culture, we must also vigorously carry out the research work of theoretical science and explore and understand the laws of nature." Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen also said: "Without theoretical research, we cannot guide the progress of science and technology; without theoretical research, we cannot summarize the rich experience in industrial and agricultural production." Therefore, to do a good job in chemical research work, it is necessary to combine practical research and theoretical research. Personnel engaged in research should try every possible means to improve their theoretical level in order to truly do their work well and solve all fundamental problems.

	V. Research, Design, and Production Should Be Combined and Carried Through to the End

Chemical research work, from the exploration in the laboratory to the actual manufacturing in the production plant, is a relatively long process. It must go through repeated large and small practical research in the laboratory and the intermediate plant, and then, on the basis of the research results, design a complete set of machines and equipment according to the actual situation and environmental conditions allowed by the factory, formulate a set of practical operating procedures, and then put it into regular production through trial production. These three different stages of work should be contracted by the chemical research institution and carried through to the end in order to complete the task quickly, well, and economically.

In this three-stage process, researchers should go to the factory as much as possible to learn from experience and take workers as teachers. Many expanded tests can also be done with the workers in the factory, listening to their opinions and criticisms. If there is no factory of the same type, you can also go to a similar factory to absorb reference materials from the side.

In short, researchers must cultivate themselves to become all-rounders who can not only research, but also design, and also know production. It may be difficult at first, but by overcoming it slowly, you can become a versatile talent. If you emphasize the division of labor and cut it into three sections, this is the style of the bourgeoisie and does not conform to socialist construction.

	VI. Implement "One Main and Two Auxiliary, Three Combinations" Between Research, Production, and Teaching

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960": "We must further closely combine scientific research, education, and production," which is a very wise instruction. Chemical research institutions must closely combine with production plants and mines and teaching institutions, because chemical research should focus on practice on the one hand, and cannot ignore theory on the other hand. Close cooperation with production plants must be done. As mentioned above, in this way, the research topics can be purposeful, and the ultimate goal of serving production can be achieved to meet the requirements of actual production. On the one hand, research institutions should vigorously support small local factories and support them; on the other hand, research institutions can also free up some strength to serve long-established and large-scale factories. Large factories have more advanced technology and many talents, and may not need much external assistance, but large factories have thousands of large and small topics. If some topics are sent to research institutions for another perspective, they may be solved better and faster. In short, research institutions cannot absolutely not assist large factories. Research institutions can definitely absorb a lot of experience from factories (regardless of the size of the factory, local or foreign) and improve their level.

Cooperation between research institutions and schools is also beneficial to both parties. School teachers and students have a deeper and more thorough theoretical research. Researchers go to schools to "learn from the scriptures" more, which is of great help to their work. On the other hand, the school absorbs the results of research, which can enrich its own teaching materials and enrich the theoretical basis. After the research institution's route, teaching and production are naturally combined.

As for the research institution itself, of course, it also contains the components of production and teaching. The intermediate experimental plant is the production plant; the amateur university that is being vigorously promoted now is the teaching institution of this institution.

	VII. Pay Attention to the Organization and Work of the Technical and Economic Office

Chemical research is mainly to serve economic construction and must have a high degree of planning. Before deciding on a topic, the technical and economic office needs to fully investigate and study all aspects of raw material supply, availability of equipment, the actual application of future research results, and possible difficulties and twists and turns in the research process, and make some possible predictions in order to assist the person in charge of the topic in making the final decision. The current research topics often involve a wide range and require the cooperation of fraternal institutions, so contacting all aspects is also one of the important tasks of the technical and economic office.

The technical and economic office is an important part of the research institution and should receive the same attention as other departments. Now some scientific and technical personnel do not like to work in the technical and economic office, and it is difficult to find people. This unhealthy thinking must be reversed. The best solution is to require some researchers to take turns to serve in the technical and economic office for a period of time, which can break the danger of closing the door and building a car, develop the ability to analyze problems from an economic perspective, and obtain the opportunity to contact the outside world, which is of infinite benefit to future work. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that researchers should not completely rely on the technical and economic office, and should not be afraid of hardship or difficulty in the topic of their own research, and should jointly investigate and study with the personnel of the technical and economic office and make a plan, so that they can have a thorough understanding and preparation for the topic before proceeding with the work.

	VIII. Selection of Topics and Handling of Failed Topics

Selecting a topic is not an easy task. The selection of each topic must meet the current needs of socialist construction in our country, so it is necessary to first consider whether its economic value can meet the requirements of all aspects. Now, under the impetus of the rapid development and Great Leap Forward situation in everything in the country, the requirements for the raw materials of any chemical product, the value of the finished product, the specifications of quality, and the difficulty of supply are all in turmoil and change. On the other hand, due to the superiority of socialism, the progress of science and technology in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is like ten thousand horses galloping at a thousand miles in an instant. The new methods and new products that were popular not long ago may now be out of date, and the scope of application has narrowed. Today's cutting-edge products may soon become ordinary commodities. Therefore, research institutions must have timely, accurate, and comprehensive technical information in order to determine the topic, and the results completed by the research institute can meet the needs and not become waste products.

How to deal with topics that cannot be completed as scheduled or are even considered to be completely failed is a very important and easily overlooked issue. The Party Committee and the person in charge of the institution must calmly and carefully study it using scientific analysis methods, because a lot of manpower and material resources have been invested in this topic, and it would be a pity to scrap it.

We must not forget that there are many examples in the history of chemistry where success was achieved after countless failures. There are also many examples where success was close, and amazing results could be achieved by further pursuing or slightly changing direction. It would be a great regret to give up easily and knock on the door without entering the room. The ancient poem "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, I doubt there is no road, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village" is worth introducing to chemical researchers for reference.

Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice" that "After people experience failure, they also learn lessons from failure and correct their own thinking to adapt it to the laws of the external world. People can turn failure into victory, the so-called 'failure is the mother of success,' 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit,' is the truth." These are words of wisdom that we should never forget.

When deciding on a topic, it is best to submit it to the local Chemical and Chemical Engineering Society for discussion by the masses in the institution and ask all parties to express their opinions. It may point out new routes and new methods, which will be beneficial to the progress of the work. Recently, the Tianjin Science and Technology Conference advocated submitting topics to the society for discussion as soon as there is a "seedling," which is a reasonable suggestion. If it is a failed problem, you should ask the society for teaching and study and decide on the steps to be taken in the future.

The Chemical and Chemical Engineering Society is a mass academic organization that gathers all parties. It includes workers, farmers, experts, professors, and cadres, and has a large number of talents. Unity is a great force. When looking at problems, people on the sidelines often see more clearly, and their own people see more vaguely. People on the sidelines see more objectively and comprehensively, and their own people see more subjectively and one-sidedly. People on the sidelines have more people and may think more thoroughly and have more methods; their own people have fewer people and may think more carelessly and have fewer methods. Therefore, holding a "Zhuge Liang meeting" in the society to gather wisdom and allow a hundred schools of thought to contend may give great impetus to the research institution and cannot be ignored. The Shanghai Chemical and Chemical Engineering Society has done a good job in this regard and is worth learning from other provinces and cities.

Now it is advocated that there are three noes in factories, that is, no waste gas in the air, no waste water in the ditches, and no waste products in the factory. Therefore, research institutions should not have abandoned topics. I advocate that each research institution establish a "Failed Topic Revival Group" in cooperation with the society to re-examine old cases and old records and decide on remedial measures, which will surely be fruitful and turn decay into magic.

	IX. Vigorously Attack the Cutting Edge of Science and Climb the Peak of Science

Although chemical researchers should take care of general topics to meet the needs of production, they should also have ambition and vigorously attack the cutting edge and climb the peak of science so that our country's chemical industry can quickly reach and exceed the international level.

Cutting-edge science is not necessarily unattainable, nor is it necessarily used in high-precision and large-scale industries. It can also be used in indigenous production methods.

Our country was originally a technologically backward country, but it has favorable conditions for catching up quickly, because starting from scratch, in many aspects, it can skip a process and immediately reach a high-precision position. It is also possible to abandon the ox cart and board the jet engine. In short, chemical research institutions must take care of both the cutting edge and the general, walk on two legs, and surpass Britain and catch up with the United States in order to become a reality soon.

	X. Attach Importance to the Work of the Intermediate Experimental Plant

After the initial success of the laboratory experiment, there is still a considerable distance from actual production. The best way is to immediately send it to the actual production plant for expanded experiments or trial production experiments. It is of great benefit to cooperate with the actual experience of workers. However, according to my experience, many difficulties often occur when implementing it. For example, the production tasks of the factory are too heavy, and sometimes there is no time to take care of the trial production work. The size and availability of equipment may become a problem, and the accuracy and comprehensiveness required by researchers may exceed the factory's habits, and so on.

Therefore, each research institution must have its own intermediate experimental plant (or experimental workshop), except when there is an opportunity to strive for direct factory experiments. This is what the West calls a "pilot plant." Because the research completed in small-scale equipment in the laboratory can only play a guiding role. Many important problems that need to be solved when putting into production, such as crystallization, heating, cooling, sedimentation, filtration, stirring, the materials used for equipment, the shape of machines, the handling of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, the treatment of waste gas, waste water, and waste products, and all operating procedures and safety protection measures cannot be made specific decisions, or even never thought of in the brain. Judging the process of assembly line operation with intermittent small operations, and dealing with the problem of hundreds of thousands of tons with the eyes of one or two kilograms, sighing at the ocean, where to start? Therefore, research institutions must establish an intermediate trial production plant in their own institution to play a "pilot" role. By conducting expanded experiments and trial production experiments on the research results of the laboratory, data can be found and conclusions can be obtained as a basis for designing, building a factory, and putting it into production.

The intermediate factory can be made into a set of equipment according to the unit operations of chemical engineering. Generally speaking, except for special products, all equipment and machines can be exchanged and used with each other without being discarded. The intermediate factory can also be transformed into a profit-making institution, manufacturing and selling some precision and expensive products. Some products can gradually develop into production plants.

Now the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has been launched vigorously, requiring production factories to reduce personnel, increase production, and reduce costs at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation. The intermediate plant of the research institution is a good base for experimenting with mechanization and automation.

In addition, it is not only possible but also necessary for chemical research institutions to directly lead several production factories as demonstration factories, which is beneficial to both research and production. Many research institutions in the Soviet Union have affiliated factories.

	XI. In Work, Sweep Away the Remaining Ideas of Emphasizing Foreign and Neglecting Local

The general intellectuals have deeply realized that "walking on two legs" is the Party's wise and correct policy, but there are still some people, including myself, who retain more or less old ideas of emphasizing foreign and neglecting local. The most prominent manifestation in research institutions is in the selection of topics. If we study cutting-edge manufacturing methods and trial-produce new synthetic products, everyone welcomes them and wants to do them. As a result, many units are doing the same work, lacking prior contact, causing unnecessary waste. On the other hand, if there are problems of improving local methods, utilizing local resources, and improving the original old products in factories, they feel uninteresting, thinking that they are not fresh and fashionable, and cannot make a splash if they are done, so few people care about them, and they are shelved, becoming a lack of doors. This idea of emphasizing foreign and neglecting local, liking the new and disliking the old is entirely due to the mischief of individualism, only caring about personal reputation and interests, and not putting the needs of socialist construction first. This incorrect thinking, although individual and not universal, must also be reversed to prevent its development.

When helping people's communes to do a good job in small local industries, it is even more necessary to completely sweep away the ideas of emphasizing foreign and neglecting local so that research institutions can exert their strength to help the industrialization of people's communes.

In short, local and foreign are comparative terms. Local represents backwardness, and foreign represents advancement. It is not necessarily that China has local, and foreign also has local. It is not necessarily that foreign has foreign, and China also has foreign. There is foreign in local, and there is also local in foreign. Local can be transformed into foreign, and foreign can also be transformed into local. It is local at this time, place, and condition, and it may be foreign at that time, place, and condition, and vice versa. If our vision can completely proceed from the interests of 600 million people, we will not care about its local or foreign when choosing topics, and we will completely consider it according to time, place, and conditions.

	XII. Use the "Two Legs Walking" Method to Vigorously Train New Forces

In view of the current rapidly developing situation in our country, the number of chemical researchers is really too small, so training new forces has become one of the important tasks of the day. The training work must adopt the method of walking on two legs. On the one hand, we must train ourselves, train while working, and run training classes, amateur universities, etc. On the other hand, we can entrust relevant production plants to train on our behalf. Personnel trained from the actual work of production plants have more practical experience, a broader vision, and are more realistic. When doing research work, they are more likely to meet the needs of production and construction and will not go astray into research for research's sake.

Since the Great Leap Forward, young comrades on all fronts have been high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, and have made earth-shattering achievements with soaring enthusiasm. The younger generation is really lovely and really useful. In order to accelerate socialist construction, older scientific and technological workers should spur their horses and do their best to train successors. This is a possible important contribution of older people to social construction. "It is a pleasure to educate the world's elites." I think every older scientific and technological worker is very happy and joyful to train younger generations. At the same time, educating others is also educating yourself. To be honest, although older scientific and technological workers had some foundation in academics before, they are inevitably lagging behind and out of touch with modern cutting-edge technology. If they can learn from each other with young comrades and work hard to study, they can get great inspiration, which is a good opportunity to improve their level and a good opportunity to contribute more to research work.

	XIII. Do a Good Job in Communist Large-Scale Collaboration

Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, chemical research institutions have blossomed everywhere, and most factories have also expanded their laboratories or established research institutes, which is gratifying. However, the work of cooperation between them has not been done enough. Generally speaking, each institution feels that the task is heavy, the strength is small, and the equipment is not enough. It is necessary to have a communist large-scale unity and cooperation and adopt the method of large-scale corps operations in order to fully exert potential to serve socialist construction.

Premier Zhou Enlai instructed us at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress in 1959: "On all fronts of production and construction, there are thousands of technical topics, and scientific and technical workers should divide their work and cooperate to solve these topics."

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said at the National Local Science and Technology Work Conference in December 1958: "We must establish an overall perspective in scientific and technological work, advocate mutual communication, exchange of experience, mutual support, and close cooperation, and promote the communist spirit."

If the research institutions cooperate closely with each other and then unite with schools and factories to effectively divide labor and cooperate, there are many benefits, which are listed below:

(A) Solve the problem of few people - Now, with the development of the situation, scientific and technical talents are felt to be lacking everywhere. It takes a long time to train new students. If mutual assistance and cooperation can be implemented, talents can be used universally or borrowed. Knowledge and experience can be exchanged, and personnel from other institutions can be used. Almost equal to the personnel of this institution, they come and go to each other, as close as a family, and the problem of lack of people can be largely solved.

(B) Accelerate research work - Now there is still a lot of repetitive work being done by various chemical research institutions, wasting manpower and material resources. Almost everyone wants to do more fresh and prominent topics, and they are done everywhere. On the one hand, it is said that there are few people; on the other hand, these few people are still doing the same thing. This contradiction must be resolved. If there are problems that everyone is interested in, we can have a small division of labor and a large collaboration, advancing along different stages, different routes, different methods, and different resources, and finally converge. This is the best way to save materials, time, people, and equipment.

(C) Solve the problem of lack of instruments - After the cooperation of various institutions, the difficulty of lacking instruments can be solved. When necessary, they can be borrowed from each other, transferred, or used with people and instruments. There are many instruments that are expensive and not used very frequently (such as electron microscopes) that several institutions can jointly use to improve the utilization rate.

(D) Sometimes two research projects are closely related, but the goals and uses are different. In this case, we can divide the labor and cooperate without repeating each other. For example, plastics and paints use artificial resins, which have the same source but different uses and different requirements. This is the best example.

(E) There are many chemical topics that are related to many other specialized disciplines, such as physics, mechanics, biology, metallurgy, electrical engineering, etc. Chemistry is closely related everywhere. It is necessary for chemical research institutions to cooperate with fraternal scientific research institutions to complete the task. If they work independently, they will inevitably take detours and cause losses.

Vice Minister Hou Debang said at the 1959 Science and Technology Work Conference: "Localism is the biggest enemy in our work." To do a good job in communist large-scale collaboration, we must first abandon localism and put others before ourselves, value others and despise ourselves, give convenience to others, and leave difficulties to ourselves. Big help small, rich help poor, advanced help backward, regardless of whether others can help me, I will help others first. We must know that helping others is helping ourselves. This principle will not be wrong.

Finally, I want to talk about ideological issues. The personnel of chemical research institutions, like the personnel on other fronts, must first strengthen their study, self-transformation, and improve their ideological level in order to do their work well.

We must first strive to study Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, because Mao Zedong Thought is the star in the darkness, the lighthouse in navigation, the sun at dawn, with red light shining into the universe. It creatively combines the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction with the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. By following this truth, we will have politics in command, obey the Party's leadership, and throw ourselves into the mass movement. Resolutely support the general line, resolutely support the Great Leap Forward, and resolutely support the people's commune. Thoroughly oppose right-leaning, muster up enthusiasm, actively participate in the increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and strive to do a good job in chemical research work and wholeheartedly serve social construction.

The above speech started from my work position - the North China Chemical Design and Research Branch of the Ministry of Chemical Industry - and I have put forward a few points that I have thought of now, and I request criticism and correction from all the committee members and comrades.

### 参加技术革新做好化工研究工作  陈调甫委员的发言

专栏：

    参加技术革新做好化工研究工作
    陈调甫委员的发言
    我完全同意并衷心地拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。
   自1958年大跃进以来，化工研究机关与其它科学研究机关一样，在党的英明正确领导之下，职工们鼓足冲天干劲，发挥无穷智慧，以乘风破浪排山倒海的豪迈姿态，突飞猛进，作出了无数的惊天动地的成绩。在这样的基础上，1959年造成了更大的跃进，本年（1960年）度各方面由于已往成绩的鼓舞，提高了信心，加强了勇气，充分利用了有利条件，第一季度做到开门红，满堂红，月月红，红到底。一般化工研究机关的工作都比去年翻一番，翻几番，提前并超额完成了计划，形势大好，我们可以毫不犹豫地说，1960年将有突破记录的、更大的、特大的跃进。
    有了已往的经验，可以保证未来的胜利。我们的成功是有把握的，我们的任务是光荣的，也是艰巨的。在此再接再励斗志昂扬的情况之下，有整军经武加强战斗力量之必要。今就进一步加强搞好化工研究工作各个方面应注意的几点，就我个人的体会略述如后。意见很不成熟，请各位委员各位同志批评指正。
      一、化工研究工作需要政治挂帅和党的坚强领导
   “千条万条，党的领导第一条”。化工研究工作有了党的领导，才能根据我国目前社会主义建设的需要，定出明确的方向，具体的目标，主要的任务，以及实现各项任务的方针、政策与措施。也就是说，业务必须以政治为统帅，才能飞跃发展，创造奇迹，为社会主义建设服务。离开了党的领导，迷失了方向，失去了灵魂，就会一事无成。
    以前化工研究工作在大跃进中的胜利是由于党的正确领导，以后更大的更全面的胜利，更需要党的坚强领导。绝大多数的化工研究人员同其它科学工作者一样，对于这点，经过了反右整风的教育，已深信不疑。但是我们科技队伍中，还有一部分资产阶级知识分子，近年来虽有些微的进步，但尚有必要加强改造，在积极服务中加强自我改造，一心一意服从党的领导，争取做又红又专的科技工作者。总之，党的领导，是根本的根本，核心的核心，一切工作，都离不开党的领导。
    二、走群众路线是最有效的办法
    群众路线是党一切工作中都行之有效的基本方法。群众的智慧，是无穷无尽的，群众的力量，是伟大无比的，群众的经验，是丰富多彩的，群众想出来的办法，是适合当时当地情况而切实可行的。所以依靠了群众，日行千里，脱离了群众，寸步难行。我们必须紧密地依靠群众，把自己从试验室的象牙塔中解放出来，投身到生龙活虎的广大群众的实践中去，不断向群众学习请教，以充实自己的经验，纠正自己的错误。尤其重要的，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，放下“专家”架子，有功不计报酬，有过勇于承认，不怕批评，不怕丧失自己的面子，才能真正与群众打成一片，拧成一股绳，同心协作，为社会主义建设服务。
    研究人员还应更进一步把自己的点滴经验与力量彻底敞开，溶化到群众力量的汪洋大海中去。这样，就能或多或少发生一些作用。倘有建议，不应停顿于口说笔写阶段，应自己动手，千方百计与群众共同操作，实地试验，才能迅速作出成绩，攀登科学高峰。
    化工研究机关有工人，有干部，有青年和老年的科技工作者，各方面应在党的领导之下，密切结合起来，互助互勉，取长补短，同心作战，携手前进。使每一个人都成为群众中的一员，无穷的潜力，就容易发挥出来了。
    三、解放思想，破除迷信，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格
    要搞好化工研究工作，每一个从业人员，首先要解放思想，破除迷信。一部分的资产阶级知识分子，思想不易解放，往往犯一系列的迷信，如迷信书本、迷信成规、迷信经验等等。有一于此，就易犯主观片面、右倾、消极等待的弊病，鼓不起劲来，有潜力不能发挥，同大跃进的新形势格格不入，不相适应，更谈不到树立共产主义的敢想敢说敢干的风格了。
    解放思想的最好方法之一，是走出试验室到生产厂去参加生产实践，才能打破“坐井观天”的局限性和“秀才不出门，全知天下事”的旧观念。
    毛主席在实践论中曾教导我们：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。这是任何人实际上走着的认识路程，不过有些人故意歪曲地说些反对的话罢了。”
    四、把实践研究与理论研究结合起来
    理论来自实践，反过来又能指导实践。
    大跃进以来，各方面提出了大量的新问题，要求从理论上加以解决。工农生产中的各种先进经验，都需要从理论上加以解释，以便进一步指导实践。一切实践研究的结果，只能给我们感性的认识，必须通过了理论的研究，发展到理性的认识，才能把研究的成果，建立在巩固的基础上而不犯“经验论”者的错误。
    毛主席在实践论中明确地指示我们：“要完全地反映整个的事物，反映事物的本质，反映事物的内部规律性，就必须经过思考作用，将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念和理论的系统，就必须从感性认识跃进到理性认识。”
    聂荣臻副总理在1959年全国群英大会上说：“为了发展技术，发展生产力，发展我国的科学文化，还必须大力开展理论科学的研究工作，探索和认识自然的规律。”聂荣臻副总理又说：“没有理论研究，就不能指引科学技术前进，没有理论研究，就不能总结工农生产中丰富经验。”所以要搞好化工研究工作，必需把实践研究和理论研究结合起来。从事研究的人员，应千方百计，提高自己的理论水平，才能真正做好工作，解决一切根本性的问题。
    五、研究、设计、生产三结合一竿子到底
    化工研究工作从试验室的探索到生产厂的实际制造是一个比较遥远的过程。必须经过试验室和中间厂反复多数次的大小不同的实践研究，然后在研究结果的基础上，按工厂的实际情况和环境所容许条件，设计成一套完整的机器与设备，制订一套切实可行的操作规程，再由试生产而投入正规生产。这三种不同阶段的工作，都应由化工研究机关包下来，一竿子包到底，才能多快好省地完成任务。
    在这个三段过程中，研究人员应尽可能到工厂去吸取经验，拜工人为老师。许多扩大试验，有时亦可到工厂去与厂中工人一起做，听取他们的意见和批评。如没有同类型的工厂，亦可到相类似工厂，从侧面吸取参考资料。
    总之，研究人员必须培养自己成为多面手，既能研究，亦会设计，并知道生产。初时可能有些困难，慢慢克服，就能成为全才。如果强调分工，切成三段，这是资产阶级的作风，不合于社会主义建设的。
    六、在研究、生产、教学之间实行“一主二副三结合”
    李富春副总理在“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”中说：“要进一步密切科学研究、教育、生产三者之间的结合”，这是一个很英明的指示。化工研究机关必需与生产厂矿和教学机关，密切结合，因为化工研究一方面应注重实践，另一方面亦不能忽视理论。与生产厂必需密切配合，上文已经说过，这样做研究的课题，才有目的性，可以适合实际生产的要求达到为生产服务的最后目的。研究机关一方面对于小土群的工厂应大力支援，把他们扶植起来；另一方面对于成立已久规模很大的工厂，
  研究机关亦可腾出一部分力量为他们服务。大厂技术比较先进，人才众多，也许不太需要外界的助力，但大厂有大大小小千千万万的课题，如果把一部分课题送到研究机关，从另一角度考察一下，也许能解决得好一些、快一些。总之，研究机关对于大厂不是绝对不能协助的。研究机关肯定可以从工厂（不论厂的大与小，土与洋）中吸取很多的经验，提高自己的水平。
    研究机关与学校合作，也是两利性质。学校师生研究理论较深较透，研究人员多到学校“取经”，对自己的工作有莫大的帮助。而学校方面吸取研究的结果，就能丰富自身的教材，充实理论的根据，经过了研究机关的路线，教学与生产就自然地结合起来了。
    至于研究机构的本身，当然亦含有生产、教学的成份，中间试验厂就是生产厂；现在大力提倡的业余大学，就是本机关的教学机构。
    七、重视技术经济室的组织和工作
    化工研究主要是为经济建设服务的，必需有高度的计划性。在决定课题之前，对于原料的供应，设备的有无，将来研究成果实际的运用各方面及研究过程中可能发生的困难和波折等等，技术经济室均需充分地调查研究，并作一些可能的预料，才能协助专题负责人，作好最后的决定。现在的研究专题，往往涉及面很广，必需兄弟机关的协作，因此与各方面取得联系，亦是技术经济室重要工作之一。
  技经室是研究机构的重要组成部分之一，应与其它科室受同样的重视。现在一部分科技人员，不喜欢到技经室工作，找人很困难，这种不健康的思想，必须扭转过来。最好的解决办法，是要求一部分研究人员轮流到技经室服务一个时期，可以打破闭门造车的危险，养成从经济角度分析问题的能力，并取得与外界接触的机会，对于以后的工作，是有无穷益处的。同时，也应指出，研究人员不应完全倚赖技经室，关于本人研究的课题，应不辞劳苦，不怕困难，与技经室人员共同调查研究，作出方案，使本人对于课题，有彻底的了解与准备，然后进行工作。
    八、专题的选择和失败专题的处理
    选定专题是不太容易的工作，每个专题的选定，必需适合目前我国社会主义建设的需要，所以必先考虑它的经济价值是否能适合各方面的要求。现在国内的一切，在飞跃发展大跃进的形势推动之下，任何化学品的原料的要求，成品的价值，质量的规格，供应的难易，均在动荡变化之中。另一方面，苏联及其它社会主义国家科学技术的进步，由于社会主义的优越性，正如万马奔腾瞬息千里。不久以前盛行的新方法新产品，可能现在已不及时了，应用范围缩小了。今天的尖端制品，也可能不久成为平凡的普通商品。所以研究机关必须手中有及时的、准确的、全面的技术情报，才能决定专题，研究所完成的结果，才能适合需要，不致成为废品。
    对于不能如期完成或竟认为完全失败的课题，应如何处理，这是一个很重要而容易忽视的问题。机关党委和负责人必须平心静气，用科学分析方法仔细研究，因为对此课题所投的人力物力已经不少，就此报废，岂不可惜？
    我们不能忘记化学史上有许多实例，经过无数次失败，才能成功。亦有许多实例，已经接近成功，再进一步追求或略略转移方向，便可作出惊人的成绩，若轻易放弃，登门而未入室，便造成莫大的遗憾。古诗：“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，值得介绍给化工研究人员作参考。
    毛主席在实践论中教导我们“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”至理名言，值得我们永志不忘。
    决定课题时最好在本机关提出经过群众讨论之后，再提交本地的化学化工学会，请各方面发表意见，讨论一下，可能指出新路线新办法，对于工作的进行，是有益处的。最近天津市科技会议提倡课题刚有“苗头”就提交学会讨论，这是一个合理的建议。如系失败的问题，更应该请教学会，代为研究，决定以后应采取的步骤。
    化学化工学会，是集合各方面的民众学术团体，它包括工人、农民、专家、教授和干部等，人才众多，团结起来是很大的力量。看问题时，往往旁边人看得清楚些，自己人看得模糊些，旁边人看得客观些、全面些，自己人看得主观些、片面些。旁边人数多，可能想得周到些，办法多些；自己人数少，可能想得疏忽些，办法少一些。因此在学会中开一个“诸葛亮会”集思广益，百家争鸣，可能给予研究机关很大的推动力，不可忽视。而上海化学化工学会在这一方面工作做得很好，值得其它省市学习。
    现在提倡工厂中三无，即空中无废气，沟中无废水，厂中无废品。因此研究机关更不应有作废的课题，我主张每一研究机关，成立一“废题复活组”，配合了学会，把陈年旧案旧记录，重新审查一下，决定补课办法，必能大有收获，化朽腐为神奇。
    九、猛攻科学尖端，攀登科学高峰
    化工研究人员虽然应照顾一般的课题以适合生产的需要，但也应有雄心大志，猛攻尖端，攀登科学高峰。使我国的化工事业很快地达到并超过国际水平。
    尖端科学不一定高不可攀，亦不一定用于高精大工业，亦可用于土法生产。
    我国本是一个技术落后的国家，但急起直追，亦具有利的条件，因为从无到有，在许多方面，可以跳过一个过程，马上达到高精地位，放弃牛车，就登喷气机，也有可能性的。总之化工研究机关，必需同时顾到尖端与一般，用两条腿走路，超英赶美，才能很快成为事实。
    十、重视中间试验厂工作
    研究室试验初步成功之后，离开实际生产，还有不小的距离，最好办法，是马上送往实际生产厂作扩大试验或试生产试验，与工人实际的经验配合作战，是有莫大的好处的。但根据我的经验，实行的时候，往往发生不少的困难，如工厂生产任务太繁，有时无暇顾及试制工作。设备大小有无，可能成为问题，研究人员要求的准确度和全面性可能超过了工厂的习惯等等。
    所以每一个研究机关，除有机会时，应争取直接使生产厂试验外，必需有自己的中间试验厂（或称试验车间），这就是西文所称“领港式工厂”。因为在试验室小型设备中完成的研究，仅能起一些指导方向的作用。投入生产时所需要解决的许多重要问题，如结晶、加热、冷却、沉降、过滤、搅拌、设备应用的材料，机器的形态，原料、半成品、制成品的搬运，废气、废水、废品的处理以及一切的操作规程和安全保护的措施，一概不能作出具体的决定，甚至脑筋中根本没有想到过。用间歇的小操作，判断流水作业的过程，以一两公斤的眼光，处理几百几千吨的问题，望洋兴叹，着手何从？所以研究机关必须在本机关中建立中间试制厂，起一种“领港”的作用。把试验室的研究成果，做扩大试验和试生产试验，才能寻出数据，得到结论，作为设计建厂投入生产的根据。
    中间工厂可依化工单元操作，制成一套设备，一般说来，除特别产品外，一切设备机器，可以交换互用，不致废弃。中间工厂，同时亦可转化成生利机构，制成一些精密高贵产品出售，有若干产品，可以逐步发展成为生产厂。
    现在技术革新与技术革命的运动已轰轰烈烈地展开，要求生产工厂减少人员、增加生产、降低成本同时并举。所以必需逐步实现机械化和半机械化，自动化和半自动化。研究机关的中间厂，就是试验机械化和自动化的良好基地。
    此外，化工研究机关，如能直接领导几个生产工厂，作一种示范的工厂，非但是可能的，也是必要的，对于研究生产均有好处的。苏联的许多研究机关，都有附设的工厂的。
    十一、在工作中扫清残余的重洋轻土思想
    一般的知识分子，已深深体会到“用两条腿走路”是党的英明正确的方针，但还有一部分人，连我本人在内，保留着或多或少重洋轻土的旧观念。在研究机关中最突出的表现在课题的选择。如研究尖端制造方法，试制合成新产品，则大家欢迎，人人想做，结果弄成许多单位同做一种工作，缺少事前的联系，造成无谓的浪费。另一方面，如有改良土办法，利用土产资源的问题，以及工厂中改良原有老产品的问题，则感觉没有兴趣，认为不够新鲜时髦，做成了不能出风头，以致少人问津，搁浅起来，成为缺门。这种重洋轻土，好新厌旧的思想，完全由于个人主义作祟，只顾个人的名誉和兴趣，不把社会主义建设的需要放在第一位。这种不正确的思想，虽然是个别的，不是普遍的，亦必需把它扭转过来，防止它的发展。
    帮助人民公社搞好小土群工业的时候，更需彻底扫除重洋轻土的思想，研究机关才能发挥出力量来，帮助人民公社工业化。
    总之，土与洋是比较的名词。土代表落后，洋代表先进，不一定中国有土，外国也有土，不一定外国有洋，中国也有洋。土中有洋，洋中也有土，土能转化为洋，洋亦能转变为土。在这个时间、地点、条件下是土，到那个时间、地点、条件下可能是洋，反之亦如是。我们的眼光倘能完完全全从六亿人民的利益出发，选择课题时就不会计较它的土与洋了，完全根据时间、地点、条件作考虑了。
    十二、“用两条腿走路”的方法大力培训新生力量
    就我国目前飞跃发展的形势，化工研究人员数量实在太少，所以培训新生力量，成为当今重要任务之一。培训工作，必需采用两条腿走路的办法，一方面自己培养，边训练，边工作，开办训练班业余大学等。另一方面可以委托有关生产厂代为训练，从生产厂实际工作中培养出来的人员，实践经验较多，目光较为远大，切合实际，做起研究工作来，容易适合生产建设的需要，不致走入为研究而研究的歧途。
    自大跃进以来，各条战线上的青年同志们意气奋发，斗志昂扬，鼓足冲天干劲，造成惊天动地的成绩，后生实在可爱，亦实在有用。为了加速社会主义建设，老年的科技工作者应快马加鞭，尽最大力量培养接班人，这是老年人对于社会建设一种可能的重要贡献。“得天下英才而教育之，一乐也”。我想每一个老年科技工作者，无不以培养后进为十分高兴愉快的事情，同时教育别人亦就是教育自己。说老实话，老年科技工作者，在学术方面以前虽有一些基础，对于现代尖端的技术，亦不免落后脱节。倘能与青年同志互相切磋，努力钻研，可以得到莫大的启发，是提高自己水平的良好机会，也是对于研究工作，贡献出更多的力量的良好机会。
    十三、搞好共产主义大协作
    在大跃进形势下，化工研究机关，已遍地开花，各工厂亦大部扩大了试验室或成立了研究院，这是可喜的事。但彼此间协作方面的工作，还做得不够，一般说来，每个机关，都感觉任务重，力量小，设备不够，必需来一个共产主义的大团结大协作，采用大兵团作战方式才能充分发挥潜力为社会主义建设服务。
    周恩来总理在1959年第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上指示我们：“在生产建设的各个战线上，存在着千千万万的技术课题，科学技术工作者应当分工协作，为解决这些课题而努力。”
    聂荣臻副总理1958年12月在全国地方科学技术工作会议上说：“我们要在科学技术工作中树立全局观点，提倡互通声气，交流经验，互相支援，通力合作，发扬共产主义精神。”
    如果各研究机关，彼此密切合作，再联合了学校与工厂切实地分工合作，有很多的益处列举于下：
    （甲）解决人少问题——现在形势发展，科学技术人才，各处均感缺少，培养新生，需要较长时间，如能实行彼此互助合作，人才可以通用或借调知识经验，可以交流他机关的人员，几乎等于本机关的人员，彼此往来，亲如一家，缺人问题，可以大部分解决。
    （乙）加速研究工作——现在各化工研究机关所做重复工作还是不少，浪费人力物力，较为新鲜突出的题目，几乎人人想做，处处都做，一方面说人少；一方面这少数人还做同样的事，这个矛盾必须解决。如逢大家有兴趣的问题，可以小分工大协作，从不同的阶段，不同的路线，不同的方法和不同的资源分路进军，最后会师，这是省料、省时、省人、省设备的最好方法。
    （丙）解决仪器缺少问题——各机关实行合作之后，可以解决仪器缺少的困难，必要时可以互相借用调拨，或以人就器，借地试验。有许多价值贵而利用不太繁的仪器（如电子显微镜）可以几个机关合备一架共同使用，提高利用率。
    （丁）有时两个研究项目，有密切联系，而目标与用途不一样，逢到这种情形大可分工协作，不必彼此重复。如塑料与漆用人造树脂，同出一源，而用途不同，要求各异，这就是最好的例子。
    （戊）有许多化工课题，与许多别种专门学科有关，例如：物理，机械，生物，冶金，电工等等，处处与化学有密切联系，化工研究机关就有必要与兄弟科学研究机构，共同合作，才能完成任务，假使独力单干，必致多走弯路，造成损失。
    侯德榜副部长在1959年科技工作会议上说：“本位主义是我们工作中的大敌人。”要搞好共产主义大协作，首先要放弃本位主义，必需先人后己，重人轻己，便利给人，困难留给自己。大帮小，富帮穷，先进帮落后，不必管人家能不能助我，我先帮了人再说。我们要知道，助人即是助己，这个原则不会错的。
    最后我要谈一谈思想问题。化工研究机关的人员，同其它战线上的人员一样，要搞好工作，首先要加强学习，自我改造，提高自己的思想水平。
    我们首先要努力学习毛泽东思想以武装自己的头脑，因为毛泽东思想是黑暗中的明星，航海时的灯塔，黎明时的太阳，红光万丈，照曜宇宙。创造性地结合了中国革命和建设的具体实践与马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。遵循了这个真理，就有了政治挂帅，就会服从党的领导，投身到群众运动中去。坚决拥护总路线，坚决拥护大跃进，坚决拥护人民公社。反透右倾，鼓足干劲，积极参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约，努力搞好化工研究工作，切切实实地为社会建设服务。
    以上发言是从我的工作岗位——化工部华北化工设计研究分院——出发，就我现在所想到的几点，提出来请求各位委员各位同志批评指正。（附图片）
