Chairman, fellow members:

I fully support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. These reports comprehensively reflect the glorious achievements and rich experiences of our country's continued Great Leap Forward last year, and also show the magnificent picture of continued leaps forward in the first year of the 1960s. We feel infinite joy and encouragement!

Recently, I and several National People's Congress representatives and National Political Consultative Conference members conducted inspections in several cities and counties in Fujian Province. We personally witnessed the tremendous and profound changes taking place in the appearance of both urban and rural areas. In particular, a new revolutionary storm—the mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution—is sweeping across the province with overwhelming momentum. Factories, mines, enterprises, docks, people's communes, schools, and streets have all been drawn into this movement. The scale, speed of development, depth of impact, and magnitude of effects all exceed any previous mass movement in production and construction. In the first half of March alone, in just fifteen short days, more than 500,000 innovation proposals have been put forward throughout the province. Wherever its sharp point touches, manual labor and heavy physical labor are routed. This is a great epoch-making transformation, marking that technical innovation and technical revolution in our province have entered a new stage, formed a new upsurge, and become the most obvious and main characteristic of this year, which began in the 1960s and will surely continue to leap forward greatly. The emergence of this revolutionary storm is by no means accidental; it is the inevitable result of continuous economic, political, ideological, and cultural revolutions, and the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The rapid development of the movement is due to the fact that, after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward in our province, especially after the anti-rightist struggle and the encouragement of greater effort, the Party's General Line has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, Mao Zedong Thought has armed the people of our province, and the communist ideological consciousness of the vast number of cadres and masses has greatly increased. The superior system after the people's communes has opened up broad roads for the revolutionary leap in production technology. This year, the leap forward targets of our province greatly exceed those of last year. The tasks have become heavier, and we cannot simply extend working hours or increase the intensity of labor. We must immediately have a great revolution in production technology and realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in order to adapt to the requirements of the objective situation and realize the magnificent plan of the Provincial Party Committee for a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has become the urgent desire of the vast number of people. They hope to get rid of heavy physical labor as soon as possible, so that their enthusiasm and wisdom can play a greater role. Thus, the combination of external and internal causes, plus the correct leadership of the Party, has resulted in a magnificent, imposing, and rapidly developing national revolutionary movement as soon as the Fujian Provincial Party Committee successively convened provincial telephone conferences on technical innovation and technical revolution at the end of February and the beginning of March, and the broad masses of people enthusiastically responded to the call.

Using Wood to Create Automated Tea-Making Equipment

Now, let me illustrate this with a few examples I have seen: Before the Great Leap Forward, the proportion of manual operations in the Fuzhou Tea Factory was as high as 80%, with low efficiency and low output. However, the domestic and foreign markets' need for tea is growing, and to further increase production, there was a serious labor shortage. Nearly 2,000 of the factory's 2,800 workers were engaged in manual tea picking. In the sweltering heat of summer, they sweat like rain, especially the baking workers who had to stand all day next to large basins of charcoal fire in workshops with temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit, their whole bodies burning. After the Great Leap Forward, the tea factory's Party branch called for large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization, and some innovations have already been made. Especially this year, after the hard work and research of the employees, self-reliance, using indigenous methods, replacing steel with wood, manufacturing bamboo and wood structure equipment, implementing the "three-in-one" combination, overcoming design barriers, and engaging in mass battles, they are marching towards complete automation and semi-automation. As a result, the most modern and advanced complete set of tea-making equipment has been created, not only realizing tea-making mechanization but also achieving a high degree of automation. The degree of mechanization has been increased to 96%, and the number of production personnel has been reduced from more than 2,800 to more than 800. The annual production capacity will increase from 110,000 dan last year to 150,000 dan, an increase in output of 35%. Now, entering the tea factory, one can see rows of wooden ladder-like machines forming strings and dragons. Raw tea materials are sent to various machines for processing and refining. Finally, fragrant jasmine tea automatically flows from the packing machine into wooden boxes for storage. From now on, one will no longer see thousands of female workers crowded in dusty, dimly lit workshops picking tea with their hands, nor will one see workers carrying heavy boxes climbing high and steep stairs. Hundreds of manual operations have been replaced by the "automatic whole embryo production line" and four semi-automatic production lines such as "flower picking", "flower sifting", "baking", "scenting and flower removing", and "uniform stacking and boxing." What is particularly surprising is that on the entire automated and semi-automated production lines, one cannot see foreign machines with steel structures, nor foundations of reinforced concrete. Most of the machines are made of wood and bamboo structures, installed on machine bases rammed with three-in-one soil or hardwood sleeves. However, the work efficiency has increased from one to one hundred times, respectively. There is also an advanced electrostatic stem suction machine and a clever flower extraction and splitting machine that increases work efficiency by 120 times. Representatives from the National Tea On-Site Conference and visitors from various places were amazed that wood could produce automation, truly a miracle! This is a great creation of the working class and a brilliant victory for the policy of "indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods"!

This great creation has given many of us a great education and enlightenment, thoroughly breaking the ideological myths that "foreign is superior to indigenous" or "indigenous methods have advantages, but can only be used as a stopgap measure." In essence, these erroneous ideas do not believe in the power of indigenous methods, nor do they believe in the brilliance of the policy of "simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods" and "from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods." It is also a reflection of the slavish thought that "the moon in China is not as round as the moon abroad." This kind of thinking should be vigorously criticized in the face of these iron facts. In the process of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, the Fuzhou Tea Factory ended the history of manual tea making for hundreds of years in one fell swoop. It will not only play a huge role in the Great Leap Forward of tea production in our province and even throughout the country, but its deeper significance lies in the fact that it will promote people to further liberate their minds, boldly create and climb the highest peak of technical revolution, and carry out technical revolution in the spirit of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, so that more creations like the Fuzhou Tea Factory will continue to emerge.

Dockworkers Liberate Their Shoulders and Take Off Their Towels

In the past, loading, unloading, and transporting work relied entirely on the heavy physical labor of workers' shoulders, carrying, and lifting. No matter how hard they worked overtime, just relying on physical strength could not keep up with the objective requirements of the sharp increase in transportation volume and heavy loading and unloading volume. It is impossible to solve the increasingly acute contradictions without completely liberating manual operations. In the last quarter of last year, the Xiamen City Transportation Department resolutely implemented the instructions of the Xiamen Municipal Party Committee to "transport more to ensure high output" and "increase production without increasing personnel," and the spirit of the city's technical innovation mobilization meeting. It established a technical innovation leading group, with the branch secretary personally in command, formulated a technical innovation plan, and issued the call to "realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and loading and unloading at high speed." Since November of last year, employees of the Transportation Department have put forward more than 37,510 technical innovation proposals, an average of six per person. Of these, 2,966 have been implemented. After more than a month of hard work, they manufactured 302 meters of continuous plate conveyors, 14 belt conveyors, 154 electric hoisting booms, 12 electric hand trucks, 8,644 meters of small railways, 7 tractors, 5 automobile booms, 2 elevators, 155 pulleys, and more than 3,600 pieces of 54 kinds of light cargo handling trucks, oil loading trucks, automatic unloading trucks, and various slides. The introduction of these innovative machines and tools into production immediately brought about tremendous changes in the appearance of handling and loading and unloading. At present, the Peace Wharf has realized the mechanization of hoisting up and down the water, the mechanization of conveying up and down the building, the electrification of towing up and down the bridge, and the vehicularization of entering and exiting the warehouse. Moreover, on two pontoons, goods hoisted from the ship's hold are continuously conveyed to the upper floor through a continuous plate conveyor, and then sent to the warehouse by pulley, so that the goods do not touch the ground, realizing continuous mechanized loading and unloading operations, thereby liberating shoulders, taking off towels, and basically eliminating heavy physical labor. After realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, not only have the workers' working conditions been improved, but also the work efficiency has been increased by one to six times, respectively. The vast number of handling and unloading workers are all overjoyed and encouraged by the rapid elimination of heavy physical labor for thousands of years and the realization of shoulder liberation. Their enthusiasm for production is even greater, and they love the Party and support the General Line even more. A veteran handling worker, Zeng Renshui, who has been working for more than 30 years, celebrated his "50th birthday" this year and was happy to make up a rhyme: "How strange, how strange, operating a machine at fifty, working for another twenty years, I guarantee there will be no problem." Dockworkers described: "We have evolved from bare hands to having eighteen kinds of weapons." Workers also wrote poems to praise: "Dockworkers are full of vigor, constantly innovating and using both indigenous and foreign methods, taking off their towels as aprons, the sound of 'yo-ho' is gone, and the sound of motors is heard!" fully expressing the heroic and happy mood of the workers.

According to their summary of the experience of this great achievement: "It is to strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command; vigorously carry out mass movements; vigorously carry out communist collaboration; implement the policy of simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods; adapt to local conditions and use local materials; and with the spirit of continuous revolution, establish lofty aspirations and great ambitions, and constantly organize assault battles, expanding step by step from points to areas, to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading and transportation."

This fact also educated us, realizing that the working class has endless wisdom and strength, has unlimited loyalty to socialism and communism, has the attitude of masters of the house who are enthusiastic and selfless in their work, and has the communist style of breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, daring to think and daring to do. These noble and excellent qualities are good examples for us to learn from. We must thoroughly overcome the old consciousness of underestimating labor and the laboring people in our thinking, cultivate a feeling of love for the laboring people, and sincerely learn from the laboring people!

Vigorously Develop Hydraulic Power Stations, Asking Water for Labor

I have been to the Xiaotao People's Commune in Yongan County and saw the brilliant achievements they have made in vigorously developing hydraulic power stations in a short period of time. The commune is divided into ten management areas, with a total of 4,300 households, more than 17,000 people, more than 3,000 laborers, and a cultivated area of more than 25,000 mu. There are nine main rivers distributed in each management area. Due to dense forests, abundant rainfall, and steep riverbeds with many rapids, there are excellent natural drops everywhere. The natural conditions are very good, and water resources are very abundant. According to incomplete investigations, the commune has 15,000 horsepower that can be developed and utilized. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people's communes have shown unparalleled superiority, expanded diversified operations, and in particular, commune-run industries have developed rapidly, requiring more labor. The commune needs 1,500 full laborers and 500,000 workdays for industrial production alone. Adding the 600,000 workdays required for agricultural production, there is a tension due to insufficient labor. Based on this situation and the favorable conditions of the commune's water resources, the commune Party committee proposed the slogan "Vigorously develop hydraulic power stations, asking water for labor," which immediately received a warm response from the commune members. After a battle for hydraulic power stations in August and September of last year, the commune built 88 hydraulic power stations with 1,155 horsepower in one go, making the processing power of 53 brigades in the ten management areas basically mechanized. After these stations were built and put into production, they greatly improved product quality and quantity, reduced costs, freed up labor, and reduced labor intensity, so that more labor could be freed up to expand industrial and agricultural production. From the perspective of the degree of improvement in the efficiency of several major processing tasks, the lowest work efficiency can be increased by six times, the average reaches ten times, and the highest reaches one hundred times. For example, in the past, manual operation of cutting sweet potato shreds only cut 100 jin per person per day, but now it can cut 10,000 jin, an increase of 100 times. A No. 2 rice milling machine can mill more than 10,000 jin of rice a day, an increase of 20 times; feed processing is increased by 20 times, sawing wood is increased by 20 times, splitting bamboo strips is increased by 40 times, and cotton ginning is increased by 30 times. It has processed more than 3 million jin of grain, more than 200,000 jin of feed, and sawed more than 200 cubic meters of wood for the whole commune. It has also cast more than 400 large and small pots, 500 plows, 5 cotton ginning machines, and 2 bamboo splitting machines. It not only saved more than 200,000 labors for the whole commune, but also made the commune-run industry possess sufficient power resources, forming a system of commune-run industry from mining, smelting, and manufacturing. It also liberated the masses' thinking and brought into play the masses' wisdom, enabling them to master lathes, planers, power saws, and other machines. Now, all commune members, with soaring enthusiasm and a hundredfold confidence, want to work hard for 20 days to realize comprehensive mechanization.

This fact shows that mechanization and semi-mechanization are not only vigorously developing in cities and factories, but also blooming everywhere in remote mountainous areas. Under relatively difficult conditions, thanks to the leadership of the Party, the leadership of Party committees and cadres, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses, they implemented indigenous methods and self-reliance, breaking through material barriers and equipment barriers. They said: "Thousands of difficulties and ten thousand difficulties, mobilizing the masses is not difficult." More than 500 people in the Datao Management Area fought hard for five days and basically completed the Zhaizhong hydraulic power station; more than 700 organ cadres and school teachers and students in the Xiaotao Management Area supported the construction of several power stations in the farm tool factory, and fought for a day and night to complete more than 100 cubic meters of stone, sand, and other materials. It broke the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few people who believed that "without foreign materials such as cement and steel, power stations cannot be built." As a result, in the upsurge of "masses running stations," wooden heads were used instead of steel shafts, old waste materials were used to build simple factory buildings, and wood was used to manufacture rice huller spindles, and water ram spindles and rotating shafts were modified. Two 20-meter-high and 30-horsepower hydropower stations boldly adopted the experience of using earth-made running water made of bamboo, using bamboo pressure water pipes and self-made wooden bucket-type wooden wheel machines. The wooden rice huller can also hull 8,000 jin of rice a day. Using indigenous methods ensured that hydropower stations were built more and faster and played a great role.

Ideological Revolution is the Pioneer of Technical Revolution

This not only reflects the wisdom of the masses, but also reflects the spirit of the masses to create wealth from poverty, run communes diligently and thriftily, and start from scratch, from small to large, which is admirable.

The above are just one or two of thousands of examples. Now, technical innovation and technical revolution are developing vigorously. Everywhere, everyone is making "changes," and everyone is talking about "innovation." People want to overthrow and eliminate the heavy manual operations that have been passed down for generations and bind the development of productive forces, and use machines to replace manpower. This is the common demand of 600 million people to quickly get rid of the "poor and blank" state. Therefore, it is not the action of a certain place, a certain unit, or a certain industry, but a provincial, national, and national movement. Chairman Mao foresaw the inevitable arrival of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and pointed out the far-reaching significance of this movement: "China can only completely complete the socialist transformation in the social and economic system, and also in technology, in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, all use machine operations, in order to completely change the social and economic face." From here, we realize that after the basic completion of the two socialist revolutions on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front, we are now carrying out another revolutionary movement, namely the revolutionary movement in the technical field. This is to liberate productive forces, to build socialism at high speed, in order to create conditions for realizing the lofty ideal of communism. Therefore, any thought and action that does not pay attention to, is not enthusiastic about, and is not active in this revolutionary movement is wrong. At the same time, the technical revolution movement is not only a great revolution in production and technology, but also a great revolution in ideology. "Politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul." Ideological revolution is the pioneer of technical revolution. Currently, this movement has been launched in a booming way, and the situation is infinitely good. For us members of democratic parties, most of whom are bourgeois intellectuals who have not been completely reformed, we should seize this great opportunity, strengthen our own fundamental transformation, thoroughly sweep away all old ideas that hinder progress, firmly stand on the proletariat's position, devote ourselves to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, and actively contribute all our skills and strengths to the people. In the three-in-one combination, we should actively strive to study and create with the working masses and learn from them, thereby improving ourselves and transforming ourselves. Under the shining of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, as long as we are determined, listen to the Party, and "lean to one side," we will definitely be able to keep up with the times and continue to move forward!

专栏：

    一个划时代的伟大改革
    练惕生委员谈技术革新和技术革命的群众运动主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。这些报告全面地反映了我国去年继续大跃进的辉煌成就及丰富的经验，也展现出二十世纪六十年代第一年定将继续跃进的宏伟图景，我们感到无限欢欣和鼓舞！
    最近我同几位全国人民代表、全国政协委员在福建省内几个市、县进行了视察，亲眼看到城市和农村的面貌，都在发生巨大深刻的变化。尤其当前一个新的革命风暴——技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势席卷全省，无论工厂、矿山、企业、码头、人民公社、学校、街道都已卷入这个运动。声势之大，发展之速，影响之深，效果之宏，都超过以往任何一次生产建设中的群众运动。仅在3月上半月短短的十五天中，全省已提出了五十多万条革新建议。锋芒所及，手工操作和笨重体力劳动望风披靡，这是一个划时代的伟大变革，标志着我省技术革新和技术革命已进入新阶段，形成了新的高潮，成为六十年代肇始的今年必将持续大跃进的一个最明显、最主要的特征。这个革命风暴的出现，决非偶然，它是不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命的必然结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物。运动迅猛发展的原因，由于我省经过两年来连续大跃进，特别是经过反右倾、鼓干劲，党的总路线更加深入人心，毛泽东思想武装了我省人民，广大干部和群众的共产主义思想觉悟大大高涨，人民公社化后优越的制度为生产技术的革命飞跃开辟了广阔的道路。今年我省的跃进指标，大大地超过去年，任务加重，既不能采取延长劳动时间，增重劳动强度的负担，自必须在生产技术上立即来个大革命，实现机械化半机械化，自动化半自动化，才能适应客观形势的要求，实现省委提出的更好更全面的大跃进的宏伟计划。因此，技术革新和技术革命运动就成为广大人民群众迫切的愿望，他们希望早日摆脱繁重的体力劳动，使他们的干劲和智慧能够发挥更大的作用，这样外因和内因的结合，加上党的正确的领导，所以一经福建省委在2月底和3月初连续召开全省技术革新技术革命电话会议之后，广大群众热烈响应号召，立即掀起波澜壮阔，气势雄伟，发展迅猛的全民性的革命运动。
    用木材搞出制茶自动化设备
    现在，且就我所看到的几桩事例来说明：福州茶厂在大跃进前手工操作的比重高达80％以上，效率低、产量少，但国内外市场对茶叶的需要越来越大，要进一步增产，就感到劳动力严重不足。全厂二千八百多工人中有近二千人从事手工拣茶，炎夏酷暑时，汗流如雨，特别是烘焙工人要在华氏一百二十度高温的车间里，成天站在大盆炭火旁拌搅茶叶，浑身火热。大跃进后茶厂党总支号召大搞机械化半机械化，已有部分革新，特别是今年来经过职工们苦干苦钻，自力更生，用土法上马，以木代钢，制造竹木结构的设备，实行三结合，攻破设计关，群众大会战，向全盘自动化半自动化进军。结果制成最现代化、最先进的全套制茶设备，不仅实现了制茶机械化，而且达到高度的自动化。机械化的程度提高到96％，生产人员从两千八百多人减少到八百多人，年生产能力将由去年的十一万担提高到十五万担，增加产量35％。现在走进茶厂，只见一台台木制梯列机器成串成龙，毛茶原料送进各种机器加工精制，最后浓香扑鼻的花香茶从装箱机中自动流入木箱装好，由车进仓。从此再不会看到成千女工拥挤在尘灰飞扬、光线昏暗的车间双手不停地拣茶，再看不到工人们扛着沉重的大箱攀登又高又陡的楼梯。成百道手工操作的工序被“整胚自动作业线”和“采花”“筛花”“烘焙”“窨花起花”“匀堆装箱”等四条半自动作业线所代替。特别令人惊奇的是整个自动化和半自动化作业线上，看不到钢铁结构的洋机器，看不到钢筋混凝土的基础，绝大部分机器是木竹结构，安装在三合土夯实的机座上或硬木套上，而工效却分别提高一倍到一百倍，还有高级的静电吸梗机，巧妙的提高工效一百二十倍的抽花分瓣机。全国茶叶现场会议的代表们和各地来厂参观的人们，都惊叹木头搞出自动化，真是奇迹！这是工人阶级伟大的创举，是“土法上马，土洋结合方针”的辉煌胜利！
    这个伟大的创举，给我们许多人很大的教育和启发，彻底打破了思想上存在“重洋轻土”，“土办法一定不如洋办法”或“土办法虽有好处，但只能是无中取有，权宜之计”等迷信。这些错误思想实质上即是不相信土办法的威力，不相信“土洋并举”“由土到洋，土洋结合”方针的英明，也即是“中国的月亮不如外国的圆”的奴隶思想的反映。这种思想在这铁的事实面前，应当受到有力的批判。福州茶厂在大搞技术革新和技术革命中，一举而结束了几百年来手工制茶的历史，它不仅将对我省以至推广到全国的茶叶生产大跃进发生巨大的作用，更深刻的意义还在于它将促使人们进一步解放思想，大胆创造攀登技术革命的最高峰，以多快好省的精神来进行技术革命，使更多的像福州茶厂的创举不断出现。
    码头工人解放肩膀脱下肩巾
    装卸、搬运工作，过去全靠工人肩膀挑、扛、背、抬的笨重体力劳动，怎样加班苦干，光拼体力，都赶不上运输量猛增，装卸量繁重的客观形势的要求，不彻底解放体力操作不能解决日益尖锐的矛盾。厦门市交通运输部门在去年决战第四季度中，坚决贯彻厦门市委提出
  “多运保高产”“增产不增人”的指示和全市技术革新动员大会的精神，建立了技术革新领导小组，支部书记亲自挂帅，制订技术革新规划，发出了“高速度实现搬运、装卸机械化、半机械化”的号召，采取了抓重点、树标兵，大搞突击战役的办法。从去年11月份以来，交通运输部门职工就提出了三万七千五百一十多件技术革新建议，平均每人六条，已实现的有二千九百六十六件，经过一个多月苦战制造出连扳输送机三百零二米，皮带运输机十四台，电动起重吊杆一百五十四台，电动扳车十二辆，小铁路八千六百四十四米，牵引机七台，汽车吊杆五台，升降机二台，滑车一百五十五辆和轻便搬货车、装油车、自动卸货车及各种滑板等五十四种三千六百多件，这些革新机具投入生产后，立刻使搬运装卸面貌起了巨大的变化。目前和平码头港口装卸已经实现上下水起重机械化，上下楼输送机械化，上下引桥电动牵引化，出入仓库车子化。而且在两个趸船，从船仓起吊的货物通过连扳输送机，一直输送到楼上，再用滑车送进仓库，做到货不落地，实现装卸机械连续作业，从而解放肩膀脱下肩巾，基本上消灭了笨重体力劳动。实现机械化半机械化操作后，不仅改善了工人的劳动条件，而且工效都分别提高一到六倍。广大搬运装卸工人，对于迅速摆脱千百年来笨重体力劳动，实现肩膀解放，莫不欢欣鼓舞，生产干劲更足，更加热爱党，拥护总路线。一位三十多年老搬运工人曾任水，今年“五十大寿”，喜得编出顺口溜：“稀奇真稀奇，五十岁开机器，再干二十年，保证没问题”。码头工人形容说：“我们从赤手空拳，革到十八般武器齐全”。工人还写了诗歌颂说：“码头工人气昂昂，不断革新土出洋，肩巾脱下当围裙，嗨哟声绝马达响！”充分地表达工人兄弟们豪迈、愉快的心情。
    这个伟大的成就，根据他们总结的经验：“就是加强党的绝对领导，坚持政治挂帅；大搞群众运动；大搞共产主义协作；贯彻土洋并举方针；因地制宜、就地取材，以不断革命的精神，树雄心、立大志，不断的组织突击战役，由点到面，步步扩展，达到实现装卸、运输机械化半机械化”。
    这一事实也教育了我们，认识到工人阶级具有无穷无尽的智慧和力量，具有对社会主义共产主义的无限忠诚，干劲冲天，忘我劳动的主人翁的态度，具有破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢做的共产主义风格。这些高尚的优良的品质，正是我们学习的好榜样。我们必须从思想上彻底克服轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的旧意识，培养对劳动人民热爱的感情，诚心诚意地向劳动人民学习！
    大搞水动力站，向水要劳动力
    我到过永安县小陶人民公社，看到他们在短短时间中取得大搞水动力站的辉煌战果。这个社分为十个管理区，计有四千三百户，一万七千多人，三千多个劳动力，耕地面积二万五千多亩，有九条主要河流分布在各管理区，由于森林茂密，雨量充沛，加以河床陡峻，水急滩多，到处是优异的天然落差，自然条件很好，水力资源十分丰富，据不完全调查，全社有一万五千马力可以开发利用。自从1958年大跃进以来，人民公社显示了无比优越性，扩大了多种经营，特别是社办工业迅速发展，需要劳动力更多，全社仅投入工业生产便需一千五百个全劳动力，五十万个劳动日，加上农业生产需要六十万个劳动日，这就显出劳力不足的紧张。公社党委根据这一情况及全社水力资源的有利条件，提出“大搞水动力站，向水要劳动力”的口号，立即得到社员们热烈的响应，去年大战8、9月后，经过一场水动力站的争夺战，全社一气建成八十八处水动力站，一千一百五十五马力，使十个管理区五十三个大队基本上实现了加工动力化。这些站建成投入生产后，大大提高产品质量和数量，降低成本，解放劳力，减轻劳动强度，便能腾出更多劳力扩大工农业生产。从几种主要加工效率的提高程度说，工效最低的可以提高六倍，平均达到十倍，最高达到一百倍。比如地瓜切丝过去手工操作每人一天只切一百斤，现在能切一万斤，提高一百倍。一部二号碾米机一天能碾出大米一万多斤，提高二十倍；饲料加工提高二十倍，锯木提高二十倍，破竹篾提高四十倍，弹棉提高三十倍，为全社加工出三百多万斤粮食，二十多万斤饲料，锯木二百多立方米，还铸出大小锅四百多个，犁五百多部，弹棉机五部，破蔑机二部，不但为全社节省了二十多万劳力，而且使社办工业具备了充足的动力资源，形成了从采矿、冶炼、制造等一连串社办工业的体系，并且解放了群众思想，发挥了群众的智慧，使他们能够掌握车床、刨床、发电锯木等机器。现在全体社员正以冲天干劲，百倍信心要大干二十天，实现全面动力化。
    这一事实说明机械化半机械化，不但在城市，在工厂磅礴发展，即在偏僻的山区也遍地开花。他们在比较困难的条件下，由于党的领导，党委、干部带头，依靠群众，发动群众，实行土法上马自力更生，突破材料关、设备关。他们说：“千难万难发动群众就不难”。大陶管理区发动五百多人苦战五天就把寨中水动力站基本建成；小陶管理区发动机关干部、学校师生七百多人支援农具厂兴建几处动力站，奋战一昼夜，便一举完成一百多方石料、沙等材料。破除了少数人认为“没有水泥钢材等洋材料，搞不了动力站”的右倾保守思想。结果在“群众办站”的热潮中，没有钢轴用木头代替，利用旧废料盖搭简易厂房，用木头制造砻谷机主轴，改装水碓主轴，转动轴。有两处二十米高三十马力的水力站，是利用毛竹的土自来水经验，大胆采用毛竹压力水管和自制的木质戽斗式木轮机。而木质砻谷机每天也能砻谷子八千斤。用土法上马保证了水力站搞得多、搞得快，发挥极大作用。
    思想革命是技术革命的先驱
    从这里不但体现群众的智慧，也体现群众因陋就简，勤俭办社，从无到有，从小到大的创造精神，值得令人敬佩。
    以上所举，不过是千万事例中之一、二，现在技术革新技术革命正在蓬蓬勃勃开展中，到处人人闹“变”，个个谈“革新”，人们要把千百年世代相传的束缚生产力发展的笨重的手工操作打倒、消灭，用机器来代替人力，这是六亿人民迅速摆脱“一穷二白”状态的共同要求，所以它不是某一地方、某一单位、某一行业的行动，而是全省性、全国性、全民性的运动。毛主席在“关于农业合作问题”中早已预见到技术革新和技术革命运动的必然到来，并且指出这一运动的深远意义：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”从这里我们体会到在经济战线上，政治战线和思想战线上两次社会主义革命基本完成后，现在我们正在进行又一次的革命运动，即是技术方面的革命运动。这是为了解放生产力，为了高速度建设社会主义，以便创造条件实现共产主义的崇高理想，因此任何对于这次革命运动不重视、不热情、不积极的思想和行动都是错误的。同时技术革命运动既是生产上、技术上的大革命，又是思想上的一次大革命。“政治是统帅、思想是灵魂”，思想革命更是技术革命的先驱。当前这个运动已经轰轰烈烈的展开，形势无限好，这对我们民主党派成员，大部分还未彻底改造的资产阶级知识分子来说，更应当抓住大好时机，加强自我根本改造，彻底扫除一切阻碍前进的旧思想，坚决站在无产阶级的立场，以高度革命热情投入技术革新技术革命的运动，积极主动把自己的一切技能和力量贡献给人民，在三结合中主动争取和劳动群众一起研究、创造，并向他们学习，从而提高自己和改造自己。在毛泽东思想和总路线的光辉照耀下，只要我们抱定决心，听党的话，“顾一头，一边倒”，一定能够跟上时代不断前进！
