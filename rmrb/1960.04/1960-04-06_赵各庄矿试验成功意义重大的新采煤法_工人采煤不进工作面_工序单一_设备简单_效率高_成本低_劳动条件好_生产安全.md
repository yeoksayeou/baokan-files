Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 4th—A new coal mining method with the same revolutionary technical significance as hydraulic mining has recently been successfully tested in the steeply inclined thick coal seams of Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhao Gezhuang Mine, resulting in unmanned coal mining faces. This has made a significant contribution to the development of China's coal mining science and technology towards more advanced fields.

The appearance of unmanned coal mining faces has made the underground coal mining process simpler. Workers do not need to enter the working face to work, but only lightly operate a machine in the working face's roadways to drill and blast. When a thunderous cannon-like sound rings out, the six- or seven-story high coal seam suddenly becomes soft and crumbly. The broken coal blocks, like a rushing black torrent, roll down the slope of the working face and continuously pour into the transport chute. Fifty to sixty tons of raw coal can be mined per hour.

The initial trial results of the three unmanned coal mining faces in this mine prove that it has the same advantages as hydraulic mining: simple process, simple equipment, high efficiency, low cost, good working conditions, and safe production. In the past, this mine used the "horizontal slicing" method to mine steeply inclined thick coal seams, which involved many roadways and a large amount of tunneling. Each working face had multiple processes such as drilling, blasting, hewing coal, supporting, and withdrawing supports. Now, there are only two processes: drilling and blasting. The tunneling rate per thousand tons of coal has been reduced from sixty meters to fifteen meters, the full-member efficiency of the working face has increased from about four tons to more than eleven tons, and the consumption of pit wood per thousand tons of coal has been reduced from 16.13 cubic meters to 6 cubic meters. At the same time, unsafe phenomena have been fundamentally eliminated, and the heavy physical labor of workers has been greatly reduced.

The successful testing of unmanned coal mining faces in Zhao Gezhuang Mine not only provides a coal mining method that is faster, better, and more economical for many coal mines in China to mine steeply inclined medium-thick coal seams, but also has great significance for the rational mining of underground coal resources and extending the life of the mine. After this mine implemented unmanned working faces, the coal extraction rate increased from 56% in the past to 75% to 80%, which can greatly extend the service life of the mine.

Currently, Zhao Gezhuang Mine, based on the situation that workers' operating skills and work such as planning, material supply, and transportation could not keep up with the emergence of unmanned working faces, is mobilizing the masses to improve enterprise management and improve workers' operating skills, so that the production of unmanned working faces can become normalized and regularized. At the same time, it is actively preparing conditions and rushing to manufacture equipment so that all steeply inclined thick coal seams can be mined using unmanned working faces within one or two months.

    赵各庄矿试验成功意义重大的新采煤法
    工人采煤不进工作面
    工序单一  设备简单  效率高  成本低  劳动条件好  生产安全
    新华社唐山4日电　一种与水力采煤具有同等技术革命意义的新采煤法，最近在开滦煤矿赵各庄矿的急倾斜厚煤层试验成功，出现了采煤无人工作面。它为我国采煤科学技术向更加先进的领域发展作出了重大贡献。
    采煤无人工作面的出现，使井下采煤过程变得更加简单了。工人不需要进入工作面劳动，只在工作面的巷道里，轻快地操纵一台机器进行钻孔爆破就行。当一声巨雷似的炮声响过，顿时，六七层楼高的煤层就松软酥碎了，破碎的煤块像奔腾的黑色激流，沿着工作面的斜坡滚滚而下，源源不断地泻入运输溜槽。一个小时可以开采原煤五、六十吨。
    这个矿三个采煤无人工作面的初步试行结果证明，它和水力采煤具有同样的优越性：工序单一，设备简单，效率高，成本低，劳动条件好，生产安全。过去，这个矿在急倾斜厚煤层使用“水平分层”开采方法，巷道多，掘进量大，每个工作面就有打眼、放炮、攉煤、支柱、回柱等多道工序。现在，只有钻孔和放炮两道工序了。每千吨煤的掘进率由六十米减少到十五米，工作面的全员效率由四吨左右提高到十一吨以上，每千吨煤消耗的坑木由十六点一三立方米降低到六立方米。同时，从根本上杜绝了不安全的现象，也大大减轻了工人的笨重体力劳动。
    赵各庄矿试验成功采煤无人工作面，不仅为我国许多煤矿开采急倾斜中厚煤层提供一条多快好省的采煤方法，而且对于合理开采地下煤炭资源延长矿井寿命也有着重大的意义。这个矿试行无人工作面以后，煤炭的采出率，由过去的56％提高到75％至80％，这就可以大大延长矿井的使用年限。
    目前，赵各庄矿根据无人工作面出现以后，工人的操作技术水平和计划、材料供应、运输等工作一时赶不上的情况，正在发动群众改进企业管理，提高工人操作水平，使无人工作面生产走向正常化、经常化。同时，积极着手准备条件，赶制设备，以便在一两个月内，使所有的急倾斜厚煤层全部实行无人工作面采煤。
