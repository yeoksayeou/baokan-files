Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow committee members:

I fully support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, at an unprecedented speed, completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The plan for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960 is another inspiring and magnificent plan. While the people of the whole country are filled with incomparable joy and encouragement, I am determined to do all the work assigned to me by the Party, actively participate in the upsurge of the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, improve my political understanding, and contribute to the great socialist construction.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work has made great achievements in recent years. The unity between TCM and Western medicine has been greatly strengthened, and Western doctors studying TCM has become a trend.

Now I will report to the conference on the research situation of TCM. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, TCM work has made great achievements. Especially since November 1958, when the Party Central Committee issued instructions on organizing Western doctors to leave their posts to study TCM, the Ministry of Health successively convened national TCM work conferences. The People's Daily published an editorial on January 25, 1959, entitled "Conscientiously Implement the Party's TCM Policy," which enabled the Party's TCM policy to be implemented more comprehensively and deeply, and promoted TCM work to a new stage. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao clearly instructed us: Chinese medicine is a summary of the experiences of our people in fighting diseases for thousands of years. It contains the rich experiences and theoretical knowledge of the Chinese people in fighting diseases. It is a great treasure house that must be continuously explored and improved. Therefore, strengthening unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, conscientiously inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, using modern scientific methods to sort out and study TCM theories and experiences, thereby developing our country's medical science, creating new schools of medicine, serving the health of 600 million people, eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, changing customs, and transforming the country have become extremely important and glorious tasks for health workers.

At present, the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine has been greatly strengthened, and Western doctors studying TCM has become a trend. More than 2,300 Western doctors have left their posts to study TCM, and more than 36,000 are studying while working. I believe that in the upsurge of the technical revolution and the great leap forward in science, these people will become, and some have already become, the backbone force in TCM research. It can be expected that several brilliant theorists will emerge from them. Great achievements have also been made in training new forces and expanding the TCM team. There are now 24 TCM colleges in the country, with more than 5,000 students. Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," remarkable achievements have been made in teaching and learning, and in politics and professional work. Teachers taking on apprentices is a fine traditional form of TCM, and this form has been widely used throughout the country to train more than 80,000 apprentices. This excellent situation of TCM, Western medicine, the elderly, and the youth forming a unified whole is an extremely favorable condition for carrying out TCM work.

The combination of TCM and Western medicine has played a great role in eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases.

The combination of young, old, TCM, and Western medicine has played a great role in eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases. Some diseases that were difficult to prevent and treat in the past have also found many effective prevention and treatment methods due to the combination of TCM and Western medicine. For example, in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, early-stage schistosomiasis patients have shown significant improvements in subjective symptoms and physical signs after treatment with a combination of TCM and Western medicine, and their weight and labor capacity have also increased significantly. The use of TCM to treat late-stage patients with ascites has been relatively satisfactory. TCM treatment can create conditions for about 80% of patients to receive antimony therapy. The use of TCM or acupuncture to relieve the toxic reactions of antimony agents is also very effective, especially for symptoms such as chest tightness, convulsions, headaches, and arrhythmia. In terms of prevention, many Chinese medicines and wild plants have molluscicidal effects; some Chinese medicines can also be used as skin protectants to prevent cercariae from penetrating the skin, and good preventive effects have also been observed. In addition, TCM has proven to have good efficacy in treating parasitic diseases such as hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria.

In the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, polio, infectious hepatitis, epidemic encephalitis B, and pneumonia, clinical research on TCM has been carried out in various regions, and significant curative effects have been achieved. For example, the mortality rate of epidemic encephalitis B before liberation was as high as 35% to 60%, which posed a great threat to people's lives and health. After liberation, active prevention and control measures were taken, and TCM and Western medicine cooperated to promote the application of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment methods. According to the statistical analysis of 1,224 cases treated by nine units across the country from 1954 to 1958, the average mortality rate was reduced to 7.6%. During the measles epidemic, various regions also accumulated a lot of experience in rescuing sick children with TCM, which played a great role. The greatest advantage of TCM treatment is that it makes measles develop well and thoroughly, thereby reducing complications and lowering the mortality rate; at the same time, TCM is also very effective for measles complicated by pneumonia and other complications. For the treatment of polio, both Chinese medicine and acupuncture have achieved better curative effects, especially for patients with paralysis of limbs for two or three years after polio, there is still improvement after treatment.

Regarding some difficult and severe diseases, such as cirrhosis, hypertension, cholelithiasis, and nephritis, clinical research work has been widely carried out throughout the country, and new progress has been made, bringing new hope to patients. For example, the treatment of patients with late-stage ascites due to cirrhosis, and the use of decoctions, acupuncture, and Qigong to treat hypertension, have all achieved good results. And in the use of TCM treatment, according to the principle of syndrome differentiation and treatment, the clinical types of hypertension and the general rules of medication have been summarized. The treatment effects of cholelithiasis and chronic nephritis have also been improved in various regions.

Not only that, but also in gynecology, such as uterine prolapse, functional uterine bleeding, etc., orthopedics, such as fractures and old joint dislocations, etc., ophthalmology, such as optic atrophy, color blindness, etc., as well as acupuncture for surgical anesthesia and various acute and chronic diseases, etc., have achieved many results, which will not be listed one by one. These examples all show that traditional Chinese medicine has bloomed brilliantly and borne fruitful fruits under the socialist system, which makes us feel extremely excited and proud.

In recent years, a lot of work has been done on the study of TCM theory; in terms of TCM research, there have also been great developments and achievements.

A lot of work has also been done on the study of TCM theory and the compilation of TCM literature. TCM theory is improved from practice to theory and then guides practice again. In recent years, through the extensive summary of TCM treatment rules and the development of research on meridians and acupuncture, more and more facts have proved the importance of TCM theory. Especially in the research of meridians, a lot of valuable data has been accumulated. This situation will undoubtedly promote the use of modern scientific methods to explain TCM theory. With the development of TCM work, a lot of work has also been done on sorting out TCM literature and translating TCM classics, and great achievements have been made. The "Huangdi Neijing Suwen," "Treatise on Febrile Diseases," "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber," and other books have been given preliminary explanations in modern language, and TCM textbooks such as "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine," "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Materia Medica," "Medical History," and related subjects have been compiled, which are of great benefit to learning, sorting out, and researching traditional Chinese medicine.

Good beginnings have also been made in the study of TCM diagnostics. For example, the application of pulse recorders to study pulse diagnosis according to the TCM method of pulse-taking has initially discovered some characteristics of TCM pulse diagnosis, which has important practical significance for sorting out TCM academics.

Traditional Chinese medicine is inseparably linked to TCM, and it also has a long history. There are many varieties of Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine has thousands of years of clinical experience in using Chinese medicine. In recent years, TCM research has also had great development and achievements. All parts of the country are conducting surveys of medicinal plants and folk medicines, and are carrying out experiments on introducing and changing wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domestic and cultivated species. The planting area of Chinese medicinal materials across the country has reached more than 3 million mu. The Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, in cooperation with relevant units, conducted a general survey of medicinal plants across the country, compiled books such as "Cultivation of Medicinal Plants" and "Chinese Materia Medica," introduced and cultivated more than 1,200 kinds of medicinal plants in the experimental field, and summarized the cultivation methods of more than 100 kinds of drugs. In addition, some regions have summarized the experience of high yields of various medicinal materials, studied the living and breeding rules of wild medicinal animals, opened up broad wild medicinal resources, and cooperated with clinical development of experimental research and screening of Chinese medicines. In recent years, they have also achieved many new achievements, and from drug components to pharmacological effects, there have been preliminary clarifications, which has provided a preliminary basis for clinical treatment. The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine has also summarized the experience in processing Chinese medicine and conducted research on Chinese medicine decoctions. These works are of utmost importance to improving and promoting the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine and safeguarding people's health.

TCM work is an important part of our country's health work. The combination of TCM and Western medicine is a concrete manifestation of the "walking on two legs" policy in our country's health work, and we must do this work well. The combination of TCM and Western medicine is reflected in all aspects of health work. In medical and preventive work, the combination of TCM and Western medicine can learn from each other's strengths and adopt comprehensive prevention and treatment measures, so as to serve the people's health more, faster, better, and more economically. In drug work, the combination of TCM and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, greatly enhances the power of eliminating pests and reducing diseases. In medical education, TCM and Western medicine education are carried out simultaneously, and TCM and Western medicine learn from each other, thereby improving teaching quality and technical level. In medical scientific research work, the combination of TCM and Western medicine is conducive to the development of national medical heritage and the development of modern medicine, and accelerates the creation of new schools of medicine.

Rely closely on the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the mass line, engage in large-scale collaboration, and realize the continued Great Leap Forward in TCM work.

Inheriting and carrying forward the medicine of our motherland is an arduous task. The key issue is for Western doctors to study TCM. I hope that more Western doctors will study TCM in depth and systematically. At the same time, TCM doctors who have the conditions should also learn Western medicine basic knowledge. TCM and Western medicine should combine to jointly complete these historically significant tasks. In order to welcome the continued Great Leap Forward of TCM work in the great 1960s, my personal experience is that we must resolutely implement the following points:

First, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and conscientiously implement the Party's TCM policy, which is the fundamental guarantee for realizing the Great Leap Forward in TCM work.

The achievements of TCM work since liberation have always been achieved under the leadership and support of the Party and by adhering to putting politics in command. Experience has proved that politics is always the soul and commander of all work. Since the rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the study of anti-Rightist ideas, the political awareness of TCM and Western medicine personnel has been continuously improved, which has greatly promoted the Great Leap Forward of various tasks. In the future, we must continue to oppose national nihilistic ideas that despise and discriminate against TCM; we must also overcome the conservative ideas of following the old ways and sticking to old rules. Only in this way can we liberate our minds, break superstitions, and promote the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, so that TCM work can develop vigorously.

Second, conscientiously implement the mass line and engage in mass movements on a large scale is the fundamental line of TCM work. Chinese medicine has always been flesh and blood related to the people. Through the practice of the people fighting against diseases, it is constantly supplemented and developed. Therefore, the mass line must be implemented in TCM work, and the Party's TCM policy must be handed over to the masses. We should conduct in-depth exploration and collation of folk remedies, secret recipes, and various therapies among the masses, and medical staff should humbly learn from the people. In TCM research work, we must also let go and mobilize the masses, and do not blindly believe in experts. Experts are important. The Party and the government have always attached great importance to giving full play to the role of experts. We do not have enough experts now, and we should train a large number of experts. But experts can only exert their strength when they are combined with the masses. Countless facts in recent years have proved that whether it is clinical treatment, TCM education, or scientific research, it cannot be completed by relying solely on a few people. Under the leadership of the Party, TCM and Western medicine must be combined, young and old must be combined, and medical staff must be combined with the people. Only in this way can we carry out all aspects of TCM work more, faster, better, and more economically.

Third, engaging in large-scale collaboration and making great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution are effective methods for promoting the development of TCM work. According to the spirit of the whole country being a chess game, unified planning, division of labor, and responsibility, and good collaboration between units and between regions. Only in this way can we fully utilize and give play to all favorable conditions, and can we better engage in technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale, thereby promoting the leap-forward development of TCM work, accelerating the work of sorting out and developing the medicine of our motherland, and making our country's new school of medicine quickly created.

I deeply feel that we are in such a great and glorious era, our lives are so rich and colorful, not only young people and adults feel incomparably excited and full of energy, but even we old people truly feel that the older we get, the younger we feel, and the more energetic we become. I will definitely study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works hard, and contribute all my strength to socialist construction and the people's health cause. The Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country require our health work to fully adapt to the development of this great era and better serve socialism. I fully believe that under the leadership of the Party, the national medical and health workers will definitely be able to push TCM work to a higher and deeper stage, and bravely advance on the glorious road pointed out by Chairman Mao.

    祖国医学在社会主义制度下大放异彩
    蒲辅周委员谈有关中医药的研究情况主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和陈叔通副主席的工作报告。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国人民以史无前例的高速度，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，一九六○年继续大跃进的计划，又是一个振奋人心的宏伟计划。在全国人民都怀着无比欢欣鼓舞的同时，我坚决做好党交给自己的一切工作，积极投入技术革命和技术革新运动的高潮中，努力学习毛主席著作，提高政治水平，为伟大的社会主义建设作出贡献。
    在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，几年来中医工作取得了很大成绩。中西医团结大大加强，西医学习中医已形成风气
    现在我就有关中医药的研究情况向大会作一个汇报。几年来，在党中央、毛主席的正确领导和党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，中医药工作取得了很大的成绩。特别是从1958年11月，党中央发布了关于组织西医离职学习中医的批示以后，卫生部相继召开了全国中医中药工作会议，人民日报于1959年1月25日又发表了“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论，这就使党的中医政策得到了更加全面深入的贯彻，把中医工作推进到一个新的阶段。党中央和毛主席明确地指示我们：中国医药学是我国人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的经验总结。它包含着中国人民同疾病作斗争的丰富经验和理论知识，它是一个伟大的宝库，必须继续努力发掘，并加以提高。因此，加强中西医团结合作，认真继承和发扬祖国医药学遗产，用现代科学方法整理研究中医理论和经验，从而发展我国医学科学，创造新医药学派，为六亿人民群众的健康服务，除四害讲卫生移风易俗改造国家就成为卫生工作者极为重要的光荣任务。
    目前，中西医团结合作已大为加强，西医学习中医已形成风气，离职学习中医的西医达二千三百余人，在职学习的有三万六千余人。我相信在技术革命和科学大跃进的高潮中，这些人员将成为而且有的已经成为中医研究的骨干力量，并且可以预期，其中将会出现几个高明的理论家。在培养新生力量，扩大中医队伍方面，也取得了很大成绩。全国已办有中医学院二十四所，在校学生五千余人。由于认真贯彻“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，在教与学和政治与业务方面都收到了显著的成就。老师带徒弟，是中医的优良传统形式，全国广泛地运用这一形式，培养了八万多徒弟。这种中医、西医、老年、青年组成一个统一整体的大好局面，是当前开展中医工作的极其有利条件。
    中西医结合，在除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病工作中，都发挥了很大作用
    青老中西医结合，在除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病工作中发挥了很大的作用。某些过去难以防治的疾病，由于中西医结合，也找到了不少有效的防治法。例如：在防治血吸虫病工作中，对早期血吸虫病，经中西医结合治疗后，自觉症状和体征均有显著改善，体重及劳动力亦有显著增加。对发生腹水的晚期患者，用中医中药治疗，效果比较满意，通过中医治疗能为约80％的病人创造接受锑剂治疗的条件。运用中药或针灸解除锑剂的毒性反应的效果也很好，对其中的胸闷、抽搐、头痛心律不整等症状的效果特别明显。在预防方面，有不少中药及野生植物具有灭螺功效；有些中药还可作为皮肤保护剂，防止尾蚴穿入皮肤，据观察也收到很好的预防效果。此外，对钩虫病、丝虫病和疟疾等寄生虫病，中医中药都证明有很好的疗效。
    在传染病防治方面，如流感、麻疹、小儿麻痹、传染性肝炎、流行性乙型脑炎、肺炎等，各个地区都进行了中医中药的临床研究，并都取得了显著的疗效。例如流行性乙型脑炎，解放前病死率高达35％至60％，对人民的生命和健康威胁很大，解放后，采取了积极的防治措施，由中西医合作推广运用中医辨证论治的方法，根据1954年至1958年国内各地九个单位治疗一千二百二十四例的统计分析，平均病死率降低到7.6％。麻疹流行期，各地运用中医中药抢救病儿也积累了不少经验，发挥了很大作用。中医治疗的最大长处是：使麻疹发得好、发得透，从而减少合并症，降低病死率；同时对麻疹并发肺炎及其他并发症，中医中药奏效也很迅速。对小儿麻痹的治疗，中药和针灸都收到了较好的疗效，特别是针灸对小儿麻痹后期的病人，有的肢体瘫痪二、三年的病例，治疗后仍有好转。
    关于一些疑难重症，如肝硬变、高血压病、胆结石肾脏炎等，全国各地都普遍开展了临床研究工作，也获得了新的进展，给病人带来了新的希望。例如治疗肝硬变晚期腹水病人，和用汤药、针灸、气功等治疗高血压病，也都收到良好的效果。并在运用中药治疗当中，根据辨证论治的原则，总结了高血压病的临床类型及其用药的一般规律。治疗胆结石及慢性肾炎，各地的治疗效果也均有所提高。
    不仅止此，如妇科的子宫脱垂、功能性子宫出血等，骨科的骨折及陈旧性关节脱臼等，眼科的视神经萎缩、色盲等，以及针灸对于手术麻醉及多种急慢性疾病等，都取得了不少成绩，不再一一例举。这些事例，都说明祖国医学在社会主义制度下，已经放出灿烂的花朵并结成丰硕的果实，不禁使我们感到无比的兴奋和自豪。
    几年来，对中医理论的研究做了不少工作；在中药研究方面，也有很大的发展和成就
    对于研究中医理论和整理中医文献，也做了不少工作。中医理论是通过实践提高为理论从而再指导实践的。几年来，通过广泛地总结中医治病规律及开展经络、针灸的研究工作，越来越多的事例都证明了中医理论的重要。特别是在经络研究方面，已经积累许多有价值的资料。这种情况，无疑地会促进用现代科学方法来阐明中医理论。随着中医工作的开展，对整理中医文献和语译中医经典著作，也做了不少工作，取得了很大的成就。内经素问、伤寒论、金匮等书已经用现代语言作了初步的解释，并且编辑了中医学概论、中药学概论、医史及有关各科的中医教材，对于学习和整理研究祖国医学都有很大的益处。
    研究中医的诊断学，也有了良好的开端，例如应用脉搏描记器，按照中医切脉的方法来研究脉学，已初步发现中医脉学的一些特点，对于整理中医学术有重要的现实意义。
    中药跟中医有不可分割的联系，同样有悠久的历史，中药的品种极多，而且祖国医学有几千年来运用中药的临床经验。几年来中药研究同样有很大的发展和成就。全国各地都在进行药用植物及民间药物的调查，并开展引种和变野生动植物药材为家养家种的实验。全国中药材种植面积达三百多万亩。中国医学科学院药物研究所与有关单位合作，进行了全国药用植物的普查工作，编写了药用植物栽培及中药志等书，在试验场引种和栽培了一千二百余种药用植物并总结一百多种药物的栽培方法。此外，还有些地区，总结了多种药材丰产的经验，研究野生药用动物的生活和繁殖规律，开辟了广阔的野生药物资源，配合临床开展中药的实验研究和筛选工作，几年来也取得了不少新的成就，并且从药物成份到药理作用，都有初步阐明，这就为临床治疗提供了初步依据。中医研究院中药研究所还总结了中药炮制经验，进行了中药煎剂的研究。这些工作，对于提高和推广中医疗效，保卫人民健康都具有极其重要的意义。
    中医工作，是我国卫生工作的重要组成部分。中西医结合是我国卫生工作中“两条腿走路”的方针的具体表现，我们必须做好这项工作。中西医结合表现在卫生工作的各个方面。在医疗预防工作上，中西医结合取长补短，采取综合防治措施，就能多快好省地为人民健康服务。在药物工作上，中药和西药结合，土洋并举，就大大增强了除害减病的威力。在医学教育工作上，中西医教育并举，中西医互相学习，从而提高教学质量和技术水平。在医学科学研究工作上，中西医结合既有利于民族医学遗产的发扬，又有利于现代医学的发展，加速创造新的医药学派。
    紧紧依靠党的领导，认真贯彻群众路线，大搞协作，实现中医工作继续大跃进
    继承和发扬祖国医学是一项艰巨的任务。关键的问题在于西医学习中医，我希望有更多的西医同志来深入地系统地学习中医，同时有条件的中医也应该学西医基础知识，中西医结合起来，共同完成这些具有历史意义的任务。为迎接伟大的六十年代中医工作的继续大跃进，我个人体会到必须坚决贯彻以下几点：
    一、紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的中医政策，是实现中医工作大跃进的根本保证。
    解放以来中医工作的成绩，始终是在党的领导与支持下坚持政治挂帅所取得的。经验证明，政治永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。自整风、反右斗争以及反右倾思想的学习以后，中西医人员的政治觉悟不断提高，大大推动了各项工作的大跃进。今后既要继续反对轻视、歧视中医的民族虚无主义思想；也要克服因循守旧、故步自封的保守思想。只有这样，才能解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，才能使中医工作蓬蓬勃勃发展起来。
    二、认真贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，是中医工作的根本路线。中国医药学一向是同人民群众血肉相关的，通过人民群众对疾病作斗争的实践，不断的补充它，发展它。因此，在中医工作中必须贯彻群众路线，把党的中医政策交给群众。对于群众中的单方、秘方和各种疗法，应该进行深入的发掘整理，医务人员应该虚心向人民群众学习。在中医研究工作上，也要放手发动群众，不要片面迷信专家。专家是重要，党和政府一向是很重视充分发挥专家作用，我们现在专家还不够，还应培养大批专家，但专家只有同群众结合起来，才能发挥力量。几年来无数事实证明，搞临床治疗也好，搞中医教育也好，搞科学研究也好，都不是单纯依靠少数人可能完成的。必须在党的领导下，中西医结合、青老结合、医务人员同人民群众结合，只有这样，才能把中医的各项工作多快好省地开展起来。
    三、大搞协作，大闹技术革新和技术革命，是促进中医工作发展的有效方法。根据全国一盘棋的精神，统一规划，分工负责，搞好单位之间、地区之间的大协作。这样才能充分利用和发挥一切有利条件，才能更好的大闹技术革新和技术革命，从而促进中医工作的飞跃发展，加速整理和发扬祖国医学的工作，使我国的新医药学派，迅速创造出来。
    我深深的感到，我们是处在一个多么伟大多么光辉灿烂的时代，我们的生活多么丰富多彩，不但青年人和壮年人感到无比的兴奋，鼓足冲天的干劲，就是我们老年人，也真正感觉到越活越年青，越活越有劲。我一定努力学习马列主义、毛主席的著作，为社会主义建设，为人民健康事业，贡献自己的一切力量。党中央、毛主席和全国人民要求我们的卫生工作能够充分地适应这个伟大时代的发展，更好地为社会主义服务。我完全相信，全国医药卫生工作人员，在党的领导下，一定能够把中医工作推向更高深的阶段，在毛主席所指示的光辉道路上奋勇前进。
