Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

We are all overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen who have returned from abroad. Not long after returning to China, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we successively participated in the overseas Chinese investment undertakings. Some are also working in the state-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporation. Over the past few years, in the course of our work, we have deeply realized that the construction cause of our great motherland is developing rapidly, and the whole country presents a prosperous and beautiful scene, Under the brilliant illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and People's Communes, China's national economy has experienced an unprecedented high speed and sustained leap forward. The foundation for industrialization has been established, and China's socialist construction has entered a new stage. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will not only be able to achieve the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960, but also certainly better achieve the grand goal of continuous leap forward in the entire 1960s, and catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in a shorter time than ten years.

Under the excellent situation in the motherland, like other construction undertakings in the country, the overseas Chinese investment undertakings have also made great leaps on the basis of the achievements made in the past few years. Up to now, state-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporations have been established in seven provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, Wenzhou, Yunnan, Shandong, and Wuhan, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Guangdong Province has also established the Overseas Chinese Reclamation and Cultivation Corporation. More than one hundred enterprises have been built and expanded by these investment companies, including sugar factories, oil factories, linen textile factories, paper mills, canneries, rubber factories, hydroelectric power stations, coal mines, and tropical economic crop farms. During the National Great Leap Forward, the products of these enterprises, regardless of quantity, variety, and quality, have greatly increased and improved. Some have doubled or even increased dozens of times in terms of output and output value. For example, the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory, invested in by the Guangdong Provincial State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporation, produced more than twice as much in 1959 as in 1958. The Shantou Cannery's products in 1958 increased 54 times compared with 1952; the Xiamen Cannery, invested in by the Fujian Provincial State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporation, produced more than twice as much in 1958 as in 1957; the output of Quanzhou Yuanhetang Food Factory in 1958 was equal to the total output of the factory in the past thirty years, and the products were numerous and of good quality, and were very popular in foreign markets. The Xinmin and Sandao Overseas Chinese Farms, invested in and built by the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Reclamation and Cultivation Corporation, have also made great achievements in planting rubber, coffee, citronella and other tropical and subtropical economic crops. Many overseas Chinese investment enterprises have carried out technological innovations during the Great Leap Forward and used waste materials to make new products. For example, the Huajian Sack Factory, invested in by the Guangdong Provincial State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporation, used banana stalks, citronella residue, and other wild fibers mixed with jute to make sacks, which reduced costs and ensured quality. Sugar factories used bagasse to make furfural, activated carbon, plywood, etc.; rosin factories extracted diesel, engine oil, and gasoline from turpentine. Since 1960, overseas Chinese-invested enterprises have also shown a new atmosphere of a good start and great success, and production has continued to leap forward. The Guangdong Huajian Sack Factory has already overfulfilled its monthly production plan for January this year. The coal output of the Yuntianhushan Coal Mine in Yongchun, Fujian, in January exceeded the total output of the first seven months of last year; the average sugarcane pressing rate of Xianyou Sugar Factory in January increased to 98%, reaching the most advanced production level in the country.

During the Great Leap Forward, many overseas Chinese investment enterprises were awarded the honorary title of Red Flag Unit. The returned overseas Chinese and their families who were placed in these and other enterprises, like the domestic workers, have greatly improved in terms of political awareness and technical level, and advanced producers and red flag bearers have emerged continuously. These advanced production units and production red flag bearers are all flowers blooming in the era of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland. They are the glory of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, and they are what our returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen should learn from.

In addition to the enterprises invested in by the state-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporation, in the past few years, due to the concern of overseas Chinese for the production and construction of their hometowns, they have also established many welfare undertakings and small investment enterprises in their hometowns. Especially after the people's communes, overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and their families have enthusiastically invested in and participated in the industrial and agricultural production and construction in their hometowns, building small reservoirs, small hydroelectric power stations, agricultural product processing factories, fertilizer factories, and other small factories. This has not only played a certain role in promoting industrial and agricultural production in overseas Chinese hometowns and prospering the economy of overseas Chinese hometowns, but also demonstrated the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese.

Seeing the vigorous development of overseas Chinese investment undertakings, we cannot help but recall the failed experiences of overseas Chinese investment enterprises before liberation. As early as the end of the Qing Dynasty, many overseas Chinese, with the idea of "saving the country through industry," returned to China to invest in and establish factories, mines, railways, and other enterprises. However, during the reactionary rule, overseas Chinese enterprises, like domestic national enterprises, not only did not receive the protection of the state, but were instead subject to the annexation and destruction of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital. The Guangdong Xinning Railway and the Zhangxia Railway in Fujian Province, which were invested in and built by overseas Chinese, were successively occupied by warlords and the Kuomintang reactionary government. In the end, even the rails and railway equipment of the Zhangxia Railway were stolen and sold. The Shanghai Nanyang Tobacco Company, invested in and founded by the American overseas Chinese Jian Zhaonan and Jian Yujie brothers, was finally annexed by the bureaucratic capital of the Kuomintang's four major families under the oppression of imperialism and its dumping policy. More recently, Mr. Huang Chongji, an overseas Chinese from Malaysia, was lured by the Kuomintang reactionaries and transported a large number of machinery and equipment from abroad to Xiamen in 1947, enough to set up ten factories. As a result, only one battery factory was barely put into production, and the other nine factories could not be put into production at all. Such situations were extremely common and almost inevitable in old China. It should also be emphasized that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is currently using the old trick of deceiving overseas Chinese, plotting to lure some overseas Chinese to invest in Taiwan. Our vast number of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have vivid memories of the painful lessons given by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the past, and are also fully aware of this conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Therefore, its conspiracy will also suffer a shameful defeat.

Only today, after liberation, can the desire of overseas Chinese to invest in and participate in the economic construction of the motherland be smoothly realized. This is inseparable from the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policy on overseas Chinese investment in China. In the early days of liberation, many overseas Chinese investment enterprises left over from before liberation, which were already dying, were reborn with the care and help of the People's Government. In 1956, when socialist transformation was carried out on private industrial and commercial enterprises invested in by overseas Chinese, appropriate consideration was given by the People's Government in terms of clearing and verifying assets and arranging employment. In August 1957, the State Council promulgated the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese to Invest in State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporations." This method stipulates that the principal can be recovered after 12 years of investment; the annual interest rate is 8%; the current year's dividend can be remitted abroad with approval after application within a limit of not more than 50%; if the investor requires work, priority will be given to employment according to the needs of the company's relevant enterprises and the specific circumstances of the investor. This fully embodies the motherland's policy of earnestly taking care of the interests of overseas Chinese, which fully conforms to the wishes and requirements of overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao investors. At the same time, the People's Government also reorganized the original overseas Chinese investment companies in various places into state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies as the main direction for overseas Chinese investment in the future. Only under the unified arrangement and use of the state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies can the funds invested by overseas Chinese better play their active role in socialist construction and better realize our desire to build our hometowns; the guarantee of principal and interest can also be reliably guaranteed.

After the people's communes, the People's Government announced that the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese to Invest in State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Corporations" is still valid, further demonstrating the care and consideration of the Party and the government for overseas Chinese. This is essentially different from the situation in which we operate industry and commerce in capitalist countries. There, market competition is fierce, the risks are great, there is infighting, no one can escape the fate of "the big fish eats the small fish," no one can guarantee that their enterprise will not fail, and no one can guarantee the future of themselves and their children. People who are "rich" today often go bankrupt tomorrow. After we return to China to invest, our funds not only find a safe and reliable outlet, but we also no longer have to worry about our children. Under the education and training of the Party and the government, our children are growing up healthily one by one, and they will all become useful talents for building the motherland. There is also unprecedented harmony and happiness among our families; we sincerely feel how stable, prosperous, and beautiful life is in the motherland. At the same time, we must also mention that the state not only gives us many preferential treatments economically, ensuring that we live a healthy and happy life, but also makes appropriate arrangements for us in our work. Many returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have participated in the management of enterprises. Many returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have also been elected and served as people's representatives and CPPCC members at the county, city, provincial, and even national levels. Returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have such status and honor in the big family of the people of the motherland, which was根本 unimaginable in old China. When drinking water, we think of the source. We can never forget the kindness of the people of the motherland, the great Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao to us.

Over the past few years, with the education and help of the Party, our returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have made varying degrees of progress in political ideology, and have also made certain progress in actively serving socialism, but these are still far from enough. Under the brilliant illumination of the Three Great Banners, through continuous learning, contacting reality, visiting construction and life practices in various places, we have received great education and help, which has made us more aware of the brilliance of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the correctness and greatness of the General Line. At the same time, we have also become more aware that only by following the path pointed out by Chairman Mao can we have a bright future. We must strive to make greater contributions to the motherland's magnificent socialist construction.

Numerous facts have proved that returning to China to invest under the guidance of the state and participating in the socialist construction of the motherland is the bright road for overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen. Especially in the context of the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese currents and the existence of economic crises in some Southeast Asian countries, the motherland's policy of guiding overseas Chinese investment has an increasingly profound impact on the vast number of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen. Everyone knows that the overseas Chinese economy has always played a positive and beneficial role in the economic development of the places where they live. Since World War II, imperialism has intensified its economic aggression against Southeast Asia, putting the overseas Chinese economy in the same precarious situation as the local national economy. Especially in recent times, some powerful groups in Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, have disregarded the facts and wantonly smeared and erased the role of the overseas Chinese economy, and have excluded and persecuted it, so that the overseas Chinese economy has fallen into a more difficult situation. This has also directly harmed the development of the local people's national economy, and is beneficial to imperialism.

Under this situation, on the one hand, in order to seek survival and adapt to the historical trend of the national independence movement of the local people, the overseas Chinese business community has closely integrated with the local people's national economy; on the other hand, the number of overseas Chinese who yearn for the motherland has also increased day by day. Overseas Chinese businessmen generally feel that the strength of the motherland is the most reliable backing for overseas Chinese, and they have a deeper understanding of the motherland's policy of guiding overseas Chinese investment. Many overseas Chinese businessmen, because of the difficulties in operating in their places of residence, currency depreciation, and huge losses of funds, sighed and said, "Nanyang money is not money, taking it back to Tangshan is the treasure." Such a mood is also very natural. For those overseas Chinese businessmen who are unwilling to continue to reside in their places of residence, we welcome them to come back and join us on the bright road of participating in the construction of the motherland. The motherland treats returned overseas Chinese equally, regardless of their time of return, and provides care according to established policies.

In addition, there are still some overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen who, in the current turbulent situation, hold a wait-and-see and adventurous attitude towards their own future and the disposal of funds: some are at a loss, wandering, and don't know what to do; some do not see the changes in the current situation and are still fantasizing about living the old life; and some people keep or invest their funds in the crisis-ridden capitalist market. These gambling-like practices will naturally not be able to solve the real outlet for funds. Facts will be the best lesson. We believe that they will surely recognize the situation and choose the path they should take.

### 华侨踊跃投资　参加祖国建设  黄长水、尤扬祖、王源兴蚁美厚、黄　洁、杨汤城代表的联合发言

专栏：

    华侨踊跃投资　参加祖国建设
    黄长水、尤扬祖、王源兴蚁美厚、黄　洁、杨汤城代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，完全同意李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，完全同意谭震林副总理关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告，以及全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我们都是从国外回来的华侨工商业者。我们回国不久，在党和人民政府的领导之下，先后参加了华侨回国投资事业。有的还在国营华侨投资公司担任工作。几年来，我们在工作过程中，深深地体会到，我们伟大祖国的建设事业是一日千里地向前发展，整个国家呈现出欣欣向荣的美好景象。在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我国国民经济已经出现了前所未有的高速度、持续跃进的局面，工业化的基础已经建立起来了，我国社会主义建设开始了新的阶段。我们完全相信：在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，不但能够实现1960年国民经济的继续跃进，而且一定可以更好地实现整个六十年代连续跃进的远大目标，用比十年更短的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。
    在祖国的大好形势之下，和全国其他建设事业一样，华侨回国投资事业，在过去几年所取得的成就的基础上，也有了很大的进跃。到目前为止，广东、福建、上海、温州、云南、山东、武汉等七个省、市和广西僮族自治区，都已经建立了国营华侨投资公司，广东省还成立了华侨垦植公司。由这些投资公司投资兴建和扩建的企业，已经有一百多个。其中有糖厂、油厂、麻纺厂、造纸厂、罐头厂、橡胶厂、水电站、煤矿和热带经济作物农场等。在全国大跃进当中，这些企业的产品，无论数量、品种和质量都有很大的增加和提高。有的在产量和产值方面都成倍地、甚至几十倍地增长。如广东省国营华侨投资公司投资的广州华侨糖厂，1959年的产量比1958年增长一倍多。汕头罐头厂1958年的产品比1952年增长了五十四倍；福建省国营华侨投资公司投资的厦门罐头厂，1958年的产量比1957年增长了两倍多；泉州源和堂食品厂1958年一年的产量，等于该厂过去三十年产量的总和，而且产品多，质量好，在国外市场很受欢迎。广东省华侨垦植公司投资兴建的新民、三道两个华侨农场，在种植橡胶、咖啡、香茅等热带和亚热带经济作物方面也取得了很大的成绩。不少华侨投资企业在大跃进中进行了技术革新，并利用废料制成新的产品。如广东省国营华侨投资公司投资的华建麻袋厂利用香蕉杆、香茅渣以及其他野生纤维混合黄麻制成了麻袋，降低了成本，保证了质量。制糖厂则利用甘蔗渣制成糖醛、活性炭、胶合板等；松香厂从松节油中提炼出柴油、机油和汽油。1960年以来，华侨投资的企业也呈现了开门红、满堂红的新气象，生产不断跃进。广东华建麻袋厂今年1月份生产已经超额完成月产计划。福建永春天湖山煤矿1月份产煤量超过去年1至7月份七个月的总产量；仙游糖厂1月份甘蔗压榨率平均提高到98％，达到全国最先进的生产水平。
    在大跃进中，很多华侨投资企业获得了红旗单位的光荣称号。安置在这些企业和其他企业中的归侨、侨眷职工也和国内职工一样，在政治觉悟和技术水平方面都有了很大的提高，不断涌现先进生产者和红旗手。这些先进生产单位和生产红旗手都是祖国大跃进年代里盛开的花朵，是华侨和归国华侨的光荣，也是我们归侨工商业者所应当学习的。
    除了国营华侨投资公司所投资的企业以外，几年来，由于华侨关心家乡的生产建设，他们在侨乡也兴办了不少的福利事业和小型投资企业。特别是在人民公社化以后，各地华侨、归侨、侨眷都热烈地投资参加侨乡工农业生产建设，兴办小型水库、小型水力发电站、农产品加工工厂、化肥厂和其他小型工厂等。这就不但对促进侨乡工农业生产，繁荣侨乡经济起了一定的作用，而且也表明了华侨爱国爱乡的热情。
    看到当前华侨投资事业蓬勃发展的情况，我们不禁联想起解放前华侨投资企业失败的遭遇。早在清朝末年，就有不少华侨抱着“实业救国”的想法，回国投资创办了厂矿、铁路等企业。但是在反动统治时期，华侨企业同国内民族企业一样，不但得不到国家的保护，反而要遭受帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的并吞和摧残。华侨投资创办的广东新宁铁路和福建省漳厦铁路，都先后被军阀和国民党反动政府所侵占，漳厦铁路最后连铁轨和铁路器材都被盗卖一空；美国华侨简照南、简玉阶兄弟等投资创办的上海南洋烟草公司，在帝国主义的压迫及其倾销政策的打击下，终于被国民党四大家族官僚资本所吞并。较近的如马来亚华侨黄重吉先生，他受国民党反动派的诱骗，在1947年从国外运了可以开办十个工厂的大批机器设备至厦门，结果除了勉强办了一个电池厂投入生产以外，其余的九个工厂根本无法投入生产。在旧中国诸如此类的情况是极其普遍的，几乎是必然的结果。由此我们还要着重指出的是：目前蒋介石集团正在袭用过去欺骗华侨的惯技，阴谋诱骗一些华侨去台湾投资。我们广大华侨工商业者，对于过去蒋介石集团所给予的痛苦教训，是记忆犹新的，对于蒋介石集团的这种阴谋也是洞悉无遗的。因此，它的阴谋也就要遭到可耻的失败。
    只有在解放以后的今天，华侨投资参加祖国经济建设的愿望才能得到顺利的实现，这和中国共产党和人民政府对华侨回国投资政策的正确是分不开的。解放初期，不少解放前遗留下来的、已经奄奄一息的华侨投资企业，在人民政府的关怀和帮助下，获得了新生。1956年，对华侨投资的私营工商业进行社会主义改造的时候，在清产核资，从业人员安排等方面，都得到了人民政府的适当照顾。1957年8月，国务院又公布了“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”。这一办法规定投资满十二年可以收回股金；股息年利八厘；本年度股息在不超过50％的限额内，经申请批准，可以汇往国外；投资人要求工作，可根据公司有关企业的需要和投资人的具体情况，优先录用。这就充分地体现了祖国切实照顾华侨利益的政策，它完全符合华侨和港澳同胞投资人的愿望和要求。与此同时，人民政府还将各地原有的华侨投资公司改组为国营华侨投资公司，作为今后华侨投资的主要方向。华侨回国投资的资金只有在国营华侨投资公司的统一安排和使用下，才能更好地发挥其对社会主义建设的积极作用，才能更好地实现我们建设家乡的意愿；保本、保息也才得到了可靠的保证。
    在人民公社化以后，人民政府又宣布了“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”仍然有效，进一步地表明了党和政府对华侨的关怀和照顾。这和我们在资本主义国家经营工商业的情况是有本质的不同的。那里是市场竞争剧烈，风险很大，互相勾心斗角，谁也摆脱不了“大鱼吃小鱼”的命运，谁也无法保证自己的企业不会失败，谁也无法保证自己和家庭儿女的前途。今天“发了财”的人，往往明天就倾家荡产。我们回国投资以后，我们的资金不但找到了稳妥可靠的出路，而且也不必再为子女耽忧。我们的子女在党和政府的教育和培养之下，一个个健康地成长，他们都将成为建设祖国的有用人材，而我们家庭之间，也出现了前所未有的和睦、幸福；我们衷心感到在祖国的生活是多么安定富足和美好。同时我们还必须提到的是：国家不仅在经济上给予我们许多优待，保证了我们过着健康、愉快的日子，而且在工作上也给我们作了适当的安排，许多归国华侨工商业者，参加了企业的管理工作。也有不少归国华侨工商业者还被选举和担任县、市、省、以至全国的人民代表和政协委员。归国华侨工商业者在祖国人民的大家庭里，有这样的地位和荣誉，那是旧中国根本想像不到的。饮水思源，我们对祖国人民，对伟大的中国共产党和毛主席给我们的恩情，那是永远不能忘怀的。
    几年来，在党的教育和帮助之下，我们归国华侨工商业者在政治思想上有了不同程度的提高，在积极为社会主义服务方面，也取得了一定的进步，但是这些还是很不够的。在三大万岁的光辉照耀下，通过不断学习、接触实际、参观各地建设和生活实践的过程中，对我们的教育和帮助很大，使我们更加认识到党和毛主席的领导的英明，总路线的正确和伟大，同时也更加认识到，只有遵循毛主席所指引的道路前进，我们才有光明的前途。我们一定要努力地为祖国宏伟的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    无数的事实证明，在国家的辅导之下回国投资，参加祖国的社会主义建设，这是华侨工商业者的光明大道，特别是在东南亚有的国家掀起反华、排华逆流和存在经济危机的情况下，祖国辅导华侨投资的政策，更加在广大华侨工商业者中，起着日益深远的影响。大家知道：华侨经济历来都为侨居地的经济发展起着积极有益的作用。在第二次世界大战以来，帝国主义加紧对东南亚进行经济侵略，使得华侨经济同当地民族经济一样，处在风雨飘摇之中，特别是最近时期以来，东南亚有的国家例如印度尼西亚的有势力集团，更不顾事实，肆意污蔑抹杀华侨经济的作用，加以排斥和迫害，以致华侨经济陷于更加困难的境地，这也就直接危害了当地人民的民族经济的发展，而有利于帝国主义。
    在这种情况之下，华侨工商界一方面为了谋求生存，适应当地人民的民族独立运动的历史趋势，和当地人民的民族经济有了密切的结合；另方面，向往祖国的华侨也日益增加了，一般华侨工商业者，不但感到祖国的强大是华侨最可靠的靠山，而且对祖国辅导华侨投资的政策更有了深刻的认识。不少华侨工商业者因为侨居地经营的困难，货币贬值，资金亏损大半，感叹的说：“南洋钱，不是钱，拿回唐山才是宝。”这样的心情也是很自然的。对于那些不愿意在侨居地继续居留的华侨工商业者，我们欢迎他们回来，和我们一起走上参加祖国建设的光明大道。而祖国对归国的华侨，都是一视同仁，不分先后，根据既定政策进行照顾的。
    另外，还有一部分华侨工商业者，在当前动荡不安的形势下，他们对于本身的前途和资金的处理，抱着观望和冒险的态度：有的徬徨、徘徊，不知所措；有的看不见当前形势的变化，还在幻想照老日子过下去；还有一些人把资金停留或投放在危机四伏的资本主义市场。这些带有赌博性的做法，自然都不可能解决资金的真正出路。事实将是最好的教训，我们相信，他们必将会认清形势，从而选择他们应走的道路。
