    Everyone with a smattering of knowledge of Chinese chess knows that a small pawn that crosses the river can capture chariots, horses, and cannons. With the cooperation of its companions, a crossed-river pawn can play a significant role in charging and fighting, and can even force the opponent's general to his death.

    In the technical revolution movement, we have many such outstanding "crossed-river pawns." Countless small factories, starting from scratch with nothing, relying on the people's bare hands and a few simple tools, using indigenous methods and creating indigenous equipment, have achieved many technological innovations. Here's an example: The Liaoyang Spring Factory, a small factory developed during the Great Leap Forward, started with only seven people, a few hammers, a few pliers, and a wooden hand-cranked spring coiling machine, and it was founded in an abandoned toilet. But this "humble" factory, in just over two years, carried out technical innovations using indigenous methods and has now fully mechanized and is beginning to automate. By the end of 1959, their product varieties had reached 386, and some had been exported overseas. Its achievements in making a big splash in the technical revolution were so great that even Anshan Iron and Steel, a modern integrated iron and steel enterprise, sent people to learn from it!

    Initially, some people looked down on it: "What can a broken factory started in a toilet produce?" "They have nothing, what can they innovate with?" But the factory's workers, though poor, did not lose their ambition: "Only those who are poor and blank want to make revolution. Enjoying what is already available is not the style of our working class!" What a spirited answer! A weak foundation and poor technology are indeed difficulties, but people with a proletarian worldview resoundingly answer: Advance in the face of difficulties! We value objective conditions, but we are not conditionalists. Everything develops from small to large, from simple to complex, from low to high. Back then, the Red Army "made revolution with a kitchen knife." How poor we were then, how poor the conditions were, how powerful the enemy was, but we still developed and grew with rudimentary weapons. Poverty can only be overcome with indigenous methods of revolution to change the face of poverty. And this first requires liberating thought and eliminating superstition. If you are always so in awe of difficulties, you cannot achieve anything. The key here is whether or not you have the ambition to build socialism. The workers of the Liaoyang Spring Factory have the ambition to build socialism. They do not enjoy what is already available, do not seek comfort, and are not afraid of difficulties. What does it matter if the factory is poor! With the ambition to change poverty and blankness, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and with "action" as the priority, we can overcome unfavorable conditions and create miracles.

    What are "indigenous methods"? They are homemade methods. Do we want foreign machines, foreign equipment, and foreign methods? Yes. But these things are not yet available in large quantities, and we cannot sit idly by waiting for them to be mass-produced. Where these "foreign" things are not available, we must learn the essence of foreign methods and implement them in indigenous methods for construction, and even use indigenous methods to create methods that foreign methods do not yet have. In 1959, the higher authorities asked the Liaoyang Spring Factory to trial-produce automobile leaf springs. This is a technically complex product, and they did not have the technical personnel, equipment, or data in this area. But what does it matter? Others use foreign methods to build, we use indigenous methods to build! The Party branch sent people to the Shenyang Spring Factory to learn, and repeatedly instructed them before leaving: "They are a foreign factory, and all the processes are foreign methods. When we go to learn, we are not learning their foreign machines, but we are learning their operations, learning the principles of technology, so that we can use our indigenous methods and indigenous equipment to make them when we come back. We must bring back their true scriptures!" The people who were sent to study did indeed bring back the true scriptures, built a leaf spring workshop with indigenous methods, and manufactured leaf springs. Some people said: "Turning iron wire into steel wire first requires foreign furnaces and foreign equipment, can we do it?" But they used local materials and, after countless experiments, turned iron wire into steel wire using indigenous methods without foreign furnaces or foreign equipment. Indigenous methods are simple, native, and rustic, but they are by no means backward, but advanced and scientific. Indigenous methods are poor methods, but poor methods have endless ways and have great power.

    A small pawn that crosses the river can capture the opponent's chariot, horse, and cannon. A person who understands Chinese chess will never value chariots, horses, and cannons and underestimate small pawns. Giving equal importance to both chariots, horses, and cannons and small pawns, and using them in coordination, can achieve a rapid victory in the battle. In our construction cause, giving equal importance to both foreign and indigenous, both large and small, can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. "A small pawn that crosses the river can capture the opponent's chariot, horse, and cannon," small pawns can make a big name and create remarkable achievements. The "little pawn" has a limitless future!

    “小卒子”前程无量	梅原
    略懂象棋的人都知道：小卒子过河可以吃车马炮。过河卒子在和同伴的互相配合下，冲锋陷阵，可以起很大作用，甚至也能逼死对方的老将。
    在技术革命运动中，我们有很多这样出色的“过河卒子”。无数小厂，一穷二白，破破烂烂，就靠人们的一双手，几把简单的工具，用土办法，创制土设备，实现了很多技术革新。这里举个例子：辽阳弹簧厂，这个大跃进中发展起来的小工厂，开头只有七个人，几把锤子，几个老虎钳和一台木头手摇卷簧机，而且是在一间废弃了的厕所里起家的。可是这个出身“卑微”的小厂子，在短短两年多的时间里，用土办法进行技术革新，现在全部实现了机械化，并且开始走上自动化了。到1959年底，他们的产品品种已达到三百八十六种，有几种已远销国外。它大闹技术革命的成就，连现代化的钢铁联合企业鞍钢还派人去学习哩！
    当初，有人是看不起它的：“厕所起家的破厂子，能搞出什么名堂？”“要啥没啥，凭什么搞革新？”可是这个厂的工人厂穷志不穷：“一穷二白才要闹革命，享现成，那不是咱们工人阶级的风格！”多有气魄的回答！底子薄技术差，这些确实是困难，然而，具有无产阶级世界观的人响亮地回答说：知难而进！客观条件我们是重视的，但我们决不是唯条件论者。什么事情都是由小到大，由简到繁，由低到高发展起来的。想当年，红军“一把菜刀闹革命”，那时我们多么穷，条件多么差，敌人多么强大，但我们照样以简陋的武器发展壮大起来了。穷，只有用穷办法闹革命，改变穷的面貌。而这首先需要解放思想，去掉迷信。倘若对困难总是那样敬畏，那是不能有所作为的。这里的关键又在有没有建设社会主义的雄心壮志。辽阳弹簧厂的工人，有建设社会主义的雄心壮志，他们不享现成，不图安逸，不怕困难。厂穷有什么关系呢！有改变一穷二白的志气，在党的领导下，依靠群众，“干”字当头，我们就能克服不利条件，创造出奇迹来。
    “穷办法”是什么？就是土办法。我们要不要洋机器洋设备洋办法？要。但这些东西目前还不那么多，不能坐等它们大量生产出来。在没有这些“洋”东西的地方，我们要学取洋办法里的精华，贯彻到土办法里来进行建设，甚至用土办法创造出洋办法里还没有的办法。1959年，上级要辽阳弹簧厂试制汽车板簧。这是一种技术上很复杂的产品，他们没有这方面的技术人材、设备和资料。可是这有什么关系呢？别人用洋办法造，我们用土办法造！党支部派人到沈阳弹簧厂去学习，临走时再三嘱咐：“人家是洋厂子，全套工序都是洋办法，咱们去学，不是学人家的洋机器，而是去学人家的操作，学技术原理，回来后好用咱们的土办法、土设备制作。一定要把人家的真经取回来！”派去学习的人果然取回了真经，用土办法建起了一个板簧车间，把板簧制造出来了。有人说：“铁丝变钢丝，首先需要洋炉子洋设备，就凭咱们？”可是他们就地取材，经过无数次试验，不用洋炉子洋设备，照样凭土办法，把铁丝制成了钢丝。土办法是简易的，土生土长、土里土气的，然而决不是落后的，而是先进的科学的。土办法是穷办法，但穷办法办法无穷，有着巨大的威力。
    小卒子过河可以吃掉对方的车马炮，一个懂象棋的人，决不会只重车马炮而轻小卒的。车马炮和小卒并重，配合运用，就能获得战局的迅速胜利。在我们的建设事业中，既重洋又重土，既重大又重小，便能做到多快好省。“小卒子过河可以吃车马炮”，小卒子能够搞出大名堂，创造出了不起的业迹来。“小卒子”前程无量！
