Striving for Continuous Leap Forward in the Motor Industry
Speeches by Representatives Chu Yinghuang, Lou Erkang, and Meng Qingyuan

In the technical innovation of the motor manufacturing industry, while vigorously promoting "four modernizations," it is necessary to focus on the reform of product design; focus on saving raw materials; focus on the design and manufacturing of high-quality, large-scale, precision, advanced, and new products; and focus on supporting the development of electricity in people's communes by manufacturing small-scale equipment.

Presidium, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with and support the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and will resolutely implement them. Now, we will report to the conference on the general situation of the great leap forward in the manufacturing of power generation equipment and electrical products.

This year's planned target for power generation equipment is 3.3 million kilowatts, an increase of 53% over 1959. This is a continuous leap forward target and a glorious task for the vast number of workers in the motor manufacturing industry. We are full of confidence and guarantee to complete and overfulfill the target. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the motor manufacturing industry has undergone a leap in development. The output of power generation equipment in 1958 increased threefold compared to 1957, and in 1959 it increased by more than one and a half times compared to 1958. The development of product varieties and the improvement of technical level have also leaped forward alongside the increase in output. The industrial layout has been greatly improved, and the material foundation of the motor manufacturing industry has been further consolidated. Under the inspiration of the great victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the mental outlook of the vast number of workers has also undergone profound changes. All of these have laid a good foundation for future continuous leap forward.

Since the beginning of the first year of the 1960s, all the workers in the motor manufacturing industry, under the leadership of the Party, have adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously promoted mass movements, and launched a surging and magnificent new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution. The central content of this movement, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out, "is closely integrated with production, gradually realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation." At present, the movement has taken root in the hearts of the people, and everyone has established ambitious goals, presenting a vivid situation of "thinking about revolution day and night, and not being willing to give up without changing the situation." The great ideological revolution has driven the great technological revolution and the great production revolution. People's ideological outlook has changed, and the production outlook has also changed. Production processes that have been considered impossible to get rid of manual operation for many years have basically achieved mechanization and automation in the past two months. Most excitingly, the coil manufacturing process has been completely transformed. Winding machines and automatic wire insertion machines have replaced tedious manual operations. In the silicon steel sheet shearing and punching process, some adopt single-machine automation, and some have formed automatic production lines. There are countless examples like this in the motor manufacturing industry where production processes have been improved, new technologies have been adopted, and indigenous and foreign methods have been combined to increase production efficiency by multiples, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times. The excellent situation formed in production, "everyone dares to create, everywhere there are Zhuge Liangs," and "every process is improved, every piece of equipment is innovated," is fully capable of rapidly emerging tens of thousands of single-machine automation, thousands of automatic production lines, hundreds of automated workshops, and dozens of automated factories in the entire industry. This "ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand" movement is sweeping across the entire electromechanical manufacturing industry, advancing with full force. In the past three months, the "four modernizations" level of the motor manufacturing industry has increased from 40% to 52% at the beginning of the year to 70% to over 90%. This has created extremely favorable conditions for this year's continuous leap forward.

While actively carrying out the "four modernizations" movement, the motor manufacturing industry has also launched a mass movement to reform product design, save raw materials, and adopt substitute materials. Under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of workers in motor factories in various regions have broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, broken through product design conventions and outdated technical standards, and strived to create novel and economical product structures, adopt new materials or substitute materials with soaring energy. The new products successfully trial-produced are like a riot of color, meeting the broad needs of national economic development and enriching the theoretical treasure house of electrical technology. For example, the technical and economic indicators of thousands of products such as medium and small-sized motors, transformers, and low-voltage electrical appliances have been generally improved; the weight has been reduced, the volume has been reduced, the materials have been greatly saved, and the product performance can still maintain the original level. After rational use and improved structure, wire and cable can also save more than 20% of copper and aluminum conductors. The mass movement of aluminum replacing copper in motor and cable products has been widely carried out since the Great Leap Forward, and new progress has been made this year. Tests have proved that the coils of medium and small-sized motor transformers can basically use aluminum instead of copper, and the cable conductors are also developing in the direction of all aluminum. In addition, the days when some medium and small-sized transformers do not use oil, medium and small-sized motors do not use outdated insulation materials (cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, paper, and ordinary insulating varnish), and cable sheaths do not use lead are rapidly approaching.

In the two years of continuous leap forward, the motor manufacturing industry has successfully trial-produced hundreds of high-quality, large-scale, precision, advanced, and new products, climbing the technical peak. Taking power generation equipment as an example, in 1959 alone, complete sets of 25,000-kilowatt and 50,000-kilowatt thermal power generation equipment were successfully trial-produced. Such a high speed of mastering the advanced production technology of large-scale power generation equipment is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. Furthermore, high-voltage transmission equipment has comprehensively reached the 220,000-volt voltage level in 1959, and is continuing to move towards higher voltage levels this year. Other products such as large-capacity rectifier equipment, precision electrical instruments, multi-channel communication cables, and high-efficiency complete electrical transmission equipment have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. This year, we must climb to higher technical peaks with greater effort.

In order to support the technological transformation of agriculture and rapidly develop the electricity business of rural people's communes, complete sets of 1,500-kilowatt "three no's" small-scale thermal power generation equipment and aluminum-clad steel wires were successfully trial-produced at the beginning of this year. It is easy to obtain materials locally, easy for general medium-sized motor and wire factories to master production, and suitable for use by rural people's communes. In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, various types of indigenous and foreign-indigenous combined power generation and distribution equipment have emerged, such as ceramic water turbines, iron-wood structure water turbines, and simple generators that do not require magnetizing machines, which are easy for small factories to manufacture universally to support the needs of the four modernizations of agriculture.

In order to ensure the continuous leap forward of the motor manufacturing industry in 1960, it is recommended to focus on the following key links:

1. Continue to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, establish ambitious goals, dare to experiment, dare to create, break through the shackles of existing technical standards and structural forms, create new structures, new forms, and adopt new materials or substitute materials to create conditions for a great leap in the technological development of the motor industry.

2. Correctly implement the policy of walking on two legs, continue to mobilize the masses, improve the level of mechanization, march towards automation, adopt new technologies, and improve old equipment to promote the rapid increase of labor productivity.

3. Adopt the form of competition and appraisal, summarize the creations and inventions in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, consolidate and improve them through analysis and appraisal, develop new product series and new production methods, promote rapid promotion, and achieve a large-scale harvest, thereby greatly improving the technical and economic indicators of power generation equipment and electrical products.

4. Break all rules and regulations in the design and trial production of new products, universally adopt the effective "five-sides" (research, design, trial production, application, and improvement) and the three-combination method of factory internal and external cooperation to accelerate the development of new products.

5. On the basis of consolidating the two participations, one reform, and three combinations, innovate labor organization, improve enterprise management level, and vigorously carry out the cultural and educational work of workers.

6. Strengthen theoretical research, combine the summary of the colorful new creations in the mass movement with the learning of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and constantly enrich and improve the level of electrical engineering theory. Promote a greater leap forward in the motor manufacturing industry.

Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, continue to deepen the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and strive to achieve "one factory becomes two factories, one person is worth two people, one ton is used as two tons (of materials), and the variety of products doubles." Strive to complete and overfulfill the planned targets of the motor industry in 1960 and forge ahead bravely for the continuous leap forward.

The above opinions are respectfully submitted for criticism and correction.

    为电机工业持续大跃进而奋斗
    褚应璜、娄尔康、孟庆元代表的发言
    电机制造工业的技术革新，在大搞“四化”的同时，要抓产品设计的改革；抓节约原料材料；抓高、大、精、尖、新产品的设计和制造；抓支援人民公社发展电力事业小型设备的制造。主席团，各位代表：
    我们完全同意并拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告，并要坚决贯彻执行。现在我们就发电设备和电工产品制造大跃进的概况，向大会作一汇报。
    今年发电设备的计划指标是三百三十万瓩，比1959年增长了53％，这是持续大跃进的指标，是电机制造工业广大职工的光荣任务，我们满怀信心，保证完成并超额完成。1958年大跃进以来，电机制造工业有了飞跃的发展，1958年发电设备产量比1957年猛增三倍，1959年又比1958年增长一倍半以上，产品品种的发展和技术水平的提高也和产量增长，并肩跃进，工业布局有很大改善，电机制造工业的物质基础更加巩固了；广大职工在总路线、大跃进、人民公社伟大胜利的鼓舞下，精神面貌也有了深刻的变化。所有这些，为今后持续大跃进，打下了良好的基础。
    六十年代第一年开春以来，电机制造工业全体职工，在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，掀起了汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的技术革新、技术革命的新高潮。这一运动的中心内容，正如李富春副总理所指出的，“是与生产密切相结合，逐步地实现机械化和半机械化，自动化和半自动化。”目前运动已深入人心，人人树立雄心大志，出现了“日思夜想闹革命，不改面貌不甘心”的生动局面。思想大革命带动了技术大革命和生产大革命，人的思想面貌改变了，生产面貌也改变了。多少年来认为无法摆脱手工操作的生产过程，两个月来基本实现了机械化和自动化。最令人兴奋的如：线圈制造工艺彻底翻了身，包扎机、自动下线机代替了繁琐的手工操作；矽钢片剪冲理片工序，有的采用单机自动，有的组成了自动生产线。像这样改进了生产过程，采用了新工艺，洋土结合、土法上马，使生产效率成倍、几十倍甚至百倍提高的例子，在电机制造工业中还不可胜数。生产上形成的“个个大胆创造，处处都有诸葛亮”，“道道工序有改进，台台设备有革新”的大好形势，就完全有条件使整个工业中迅速地涌现出成万个单机自动化，成千个自动生产线，成几百个自动化车间和成几十个自动化工厂。这个“十、百、千、万”的运动，正在席卷整个机电制造工业，汹涌澎湃的前进。三个月来电机制造工业的“四化”程度，已经从年初的40％到52％，提高至70％到90％以上。这就给今年持续大跃进创造了极为有利的条件。
    电机制造工业在积极开展“四化”运动的同时，也开展了改革产品设计，节约原材料和采用代用材料的群众运动。各地电机工厂的广大职工，在党的领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，冲破产品设计常规与陈旧的技术标准，以冲天干劲，千方百计地创造新颖而经济的产品结构，采用新材料或代用材料，试制成功的新型产品如同万紫千红争妍斗艳，既满足国民经济发展的广泛需要，又丰富了电工技术的理论宝库。例如中、小型电动机、变压器、低压电器等数千种产品的技术经济指标都已普遍提高；重量减轻了，体积缩小了，材料大大节约了，而产品性能仍能保持原有水平。经过合理使用及改进结构，电线电缆也能节约铜铝导体20％以上。电机、电缆产品中以铝代铜的群众运动，大跃进以来已经广泛开展，今年又取得了新的进展。试验证明，中小型电动机变压器的线圈，基本上可以用铝代铜，电线电缆导体亦在向全部用铝的方向发展。此外，中小型变压器一部分不用油，中小型电动机不用陈旧的绝缘材料（棉纱、棉织物、纸和普通绝缘油漆），电缆护套不用铅的日子即将迅速来到。
    两年来的连续大跃进，电机制造工业试制成功了数以百计的高大精尖新产品，攀登了技术高峰。以发电设备为例，1959年一年内先后试制成功二万五千瓩及五万瓩成套火力发电设备，这样高速度的掌握大型发电设备的先进生产技术，是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。再如高压输电设备1959年已经全面达到了二十二万伏电压级水平，今年正向更高电压级继续迈进。其他如大容量整流设备，精密电工仪器，多路通讯电缆，高效率成套电气传动装备，都已先后试制成功，投入生产。今年要以更大的干劲攀登更高的技术高峰。
    为了支援农业的技术改造，迅速发展农村人民公社的电力事业，今年初试制成功了一千五百瓩的“三不用”成套小型火力发电设备及铝包钢线等，便于就地取材，便于一般中型电机电线工厂掌握生产，而且适合于农村人民公社的使用。在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中又出现了各种类型的土的和洋土结合的发电、配电设备，例如陶瓷水轮机、铁木结构水轮机、不用砺磁机的简易发电机等便于小型工厂普遍制造，支援农业四化的需要。
    为了保证电机制造工业在1960年的持续大跃进，建议抓紧以下几个主要环节：
    一、继续破除迷信解放思想，树立雄心大志，大胆试验，大胆创造，冲破现有技术标准和结构型式的束缚，创造新结构、新型式，采用新型材料或代用材料为电机工业技术发展的大飞跃创造条件。
    二、正确贯彻两条腿走路的方针，继续发动群众，提高机械化水平，向自动化进军，采用新工艺，改进老设备，促使劳动生产率飞速提高。
    三、采用竞赛评比形式，总结技术革新及技术革命运动中的创造发明，通过分析鉴定，予以巩固提高，发展新的产品系列和新的生产方法，促使迅速推广，获得大面积丰收，从而大大提高发电设备和电工产品的技术经济指标。
    四、破除新产品设计和试制中的一切清规戒律，普遍采用行之有效的“五边”（边研究、边设计、边试制、边运用、边改进）及厂内外三结合大协作的方法，以加速新产品的发展。
    五、在巩固两参一改三结合的基础上，革新劳动组织，提高企业管理水平和大力开展职工的文化教育工作。
    六、加强理论研究，把总结群众运动中万紫千红的新创造和学习苏联及其他社会主义国家的先进经验结合起来，不断丰富和提高电工理论水平。促进电机制造工业的更大跃进。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗紧密依靠党的领导，继续深入开展技术革新技术革命的群众运动，争取实现“一厂变两厂，一人顶两人，一吨当两吨（材料），产品品种翻一番”。为完成和超额完成1960年电机工业的计划指标，和持续大跃进而奋勇前进。以上意见敬请批评指正。
