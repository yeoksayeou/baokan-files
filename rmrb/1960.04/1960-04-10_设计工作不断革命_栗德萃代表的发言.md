Continuous Revolution in Design Work
Speech by Representative Li Decui

    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and will resolutely implement them in my work, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan.
    I am a designer at the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute. Through studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our designers have armed our minds, resolutely opposed rightism, greatly boosted our energy, held high the red banner of the Three Wan Suis, and continued to uphold and promote the communist style of breaking superstitions, emancipating our minds, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. With the thought of continuous revolution, the design work has seen a sustained great leap forward. A vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has been launched in our institute, with large-scale technical performance competitions, the adoption of advanced experiences, and the innovation of tools and new technologies, so that design work can be done at high speed and with high quality. Engineering standardization has been achieved; calculations have been made graphic, slide-rule-based, and electrical; drawing has been achieved through movable type assembly and blueprinting through printing; the old division of labor has been changed, and new design businesses have been established. In the first quarter of this year, the slogans of a "red opening," "monthly red," and "full-house red" proposed at the beginning of the year were realized. The design task was completed half a month ahead of schedule in January, and the design and experimental research tasks for the first quarter were completed ahead of schedule in February. On March 15, the annual design workload was completed nine and a half months ahead of schedule, increasing efficiency by thirteen times compared with the period of the First Five-Year Plan, and by 4.7 times compared with the great leap forward of 1958. This mass movement of technical performance competitions is not only a revolution in design methods, but also drives the overall leap forward of our hospital's work, and also educated our designers themselves, universally improving their ideological understanding, and is also an ideological revolution. After the rectification and anti-rightist and double-anti movements in 1958, a situation of great leap forward emerged. Since then, the design work has undergone great changes, reversing the situation of design lagging behind construction, and achieving the great results of "double the speed, one person equals three, first-class products, and half the investment." The double-anti movement was the first revolution in design work, and this mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is another revolution in design work.
    At present, the national mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is unfolding with irresistible force and magnificent momentum. Our designers will, together with the people of the whole country, hold high the red banner of Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, advance victoriously, lead the movement to a new stage, and make great technical revolutions in improving process production flow, in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and in reducing the cost of enterprises, and comprehensively summarize the inventions and creations of the masses since the great leap forward, and systematically apply them to design. Our slogan is: "Learn while creating, create while summarizing, summarize while promoting," and contribute all our strength to the continued leap forward in 1960 and the continued leap forward in the 1960s.

### 设计工作不断革命  栗德萃代表的发言

    设计工作不断革命
    栗德萃代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，并在工作中坚决地贯彻执行，为完成并超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    我是有色冶金设计总院的一个设计人员。我们设计人员通过八届八中全会文件的学习，武装了自己的思想，狠反右倾，大鼓干劲，高举三个万岁的红旗，继续坚持发扬了破除迷信，解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，以不断革命论的思想，使设计工作出现了持续大跃进的局面。在我院开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，大搞技术表演赛，大搞先进经验配套，大搞工具革新、新技术，使设计工作作到了高速优质。实现了工程配套；计算图表化，算尺化，电气化；实现了制图活版装配化和描晒图的印刷化；改变了旧的劳动分工，建立了新的设计业务。在今年第一季度内，实现了年初提出的开门红，月月红，满堂红的口号。1月份提前半个月完成了设计任务，2月份又提前完成了第一季度的设计任务与试验研究任务。3月15日又提前九个半月完成了全年设计工作量。比第一个五年计划期间内提高效率十三倍，与大跃进的1958年比又提高四点七倍。这次技术表演赛的群众运动，不仅是设计方法的革命，而且带动了我院工作的全面跃进，同时也教育了我们设计人员自己，普遍提高了思想认识，也是一次思想上的革命。1958年经过整风反右和双反运动以后，出现了大跃进的局面，从那时起设计工作就有了很大的转变，扭转了设计落后于施工的局面，获得了“速度快一倍，人力一顶三，产品列一等，投资省一半”的巨大成果。双反运动是设计工作的第一次革命，而这次技术革新、技术革命的群众运动是设计工作又一次的革命。
    目前全民的技术革新，技术革命运动正以破竹之势，波澜壮阔地开展着。我们设计人员将与全国人民一道，高举毛主席不断革命的思想红旗，乘胜前进，把运动引向新的阶段，在改进工艺生产流程方面，在原材料的综合利用上，在降低企业的成本上，大闹技术革命，并全面总结大跃进以来，群众的发明创造，并把它系统地运用到设计中去。我们的口号是：“边学习，边创造，边总结，边推广”，为1960年的继续跃进和六十年代的继续跃进贡献出我们的全部力量。
