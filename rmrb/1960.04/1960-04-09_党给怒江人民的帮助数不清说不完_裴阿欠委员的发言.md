Fellow Committee Members:
	I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I sincerely support them.
	The reports of the two Vice Premiers demonstrate the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist construction and point out the tasks for the future, which makes me further realize the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in our country and the direction of our future efforts. When I recall the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the country was poor and weak and subjected to bullying. The reactionary government only knew how to oppress and exploit the people and did not care about national construction. The people only knew how to pay money and grain, but they did not know where the money and grain were used. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country is becoming prosperous year by year, and construction is leaping forward year by year. Every year, we come to Beijing from all over the country for meetings, and the government reports to us on the situation of our country's socialist construction and consults with us on the cause of socialist construction. The government clearly tells us how much the country earns and spends each year. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, everything proceeds from the interests of the people and everything is for the cause of socialist construction. Everything comes from the people and is used for the people, and everything is for the interests of the more than 600 million people, which truly makes us feel grateful and invigorated. Therefore, we must resolutely follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, support the three magic weapons of socialist construction, accelerate our country's socialist construction, and thoroughly change our country's "poor and blank" face.

	Creating a Happy Life with Our Own Working Hands
	In order for the people of all nationalities to transition to a socialist society together, the Party and Chairman Mao have formulated different guidelines and policies based on the different characteristics of political, economic, and cultural development in ethnic minority areas. For example, the various ethnic groups in our Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, due to the long-term oppression and exploitation by the reactionaries before liberation, were extremely backward in political, economic, and cultural development, and still retained many primitive remnants. In light of this situation, the Party and the government adopted the policy of direct transition and vigorously helped the people of all ethnic groups develop politics, economy, and culture. Over the past few years since liberation, great achievements have been made in all aspects, production has greatly developed, and people's lives have improved. In particular, since 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, like the rest of the country, has also launched a Great Leap Forward, and the backward face is rapidly changing, and the consciousness of the masses has greatly increased. Everyone realizes that only by taking the socialist road can we have a correct path, and only the Communist Party truly represents the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups. Therefore, in the Great Leap Forward, the people of all ethnic groups have displayed soaring enthusiasm and, under the leadership of the Party, created their own happy lives with their own working hands. In 1958 alone, 1,300 water conservancy projects were built, and 80,000 mu of paddy fields were opened up. As a result, production has greatly developed, and people's lives have significantly improved. According to the situation in 1959, grain production averaged 1,500 jin per person, and some counties, such as Lushui County, reached 1,700 jin, which has never happened before in history. Not only that, but there has also been great development in cultural, educational, and health undertakings. Before liberation, there were very few literate people in our Nujiang. For example, there were only nine middle school students in Fugong and Bijiang counties, and only four primary schools in the four counties, but few people attended school. There were no hospitals at all. If people were sick, they had no medicine to take and could only kill livestock and sacrifice to ghosts. Every year, many people died. Who cared about the lives of our people?

	Since liberation, the Party has established many schools for our ethnic groups, including primary schools, middle schools, and universities, and has carried out literacy campaigns. Now, people of all ages have initially mastered some cultural knowledge, and the days of cultural suffering for the people of Nujiang are gone forever. In terms of health, in addition to many health centers in various counties and townships, a large 18-room tiled house has been built in the seat of the autonomous prefecture's organs as a hospital. From now on, people will no longer kill livestock and sacrifice to ghosts when they are sick. All of this shows that the help given to us by the Party and the People's Government is truly countless, unspeakable, and endless. The people of all ethnic groups in Nujiang have personally experienced the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the infinite happiness that the socialist system has brought us.

	The Road to Happiness, the Road to Socialism
	From the perspective of transportation, there has also been a leap forward development. The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture is located on the frontier of the motherland. The mountains are high and the roads are long. The Biluo Snow Mountain is covered with snow all year round, and transportation is very inconvenient. Before liberation, many people died of freezing on the snow mountain every year. However, after liberation, the Party and the People's Government have shown great concern for the people of all ethnic groups in Nujiang. In 1953, a road was built from Bijiang to Lanping on the Daxueshan Mountain. Since then, there have been no more tragic situations of people freezing to death on the Daxueshan Mountain. Not only that, but since 1958, a highway has been dug from Jianchuan, preparing to connect to Nujiang. This highway will soon be open to traffic. A highway has also been dug from Wayue to Bijiang, which is now basically completed. When the people of all ethnic groups in Nujiang saw the cars coming from the interior, they happily and gratefully said, "The Communist Party has good leadership. The automobile road has been opened in Nujiang. From now on, we don't have to walk on foot, and we don't have to carry things on our backs." The people of all ethnic groups in Nujiang regard these two highways as the road to happiness and the road to socialism. Truly, it will bring us infinite happiness.

	The First Batch of Workers Appeared in the Lisu Nationality
	The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, like the rest of the country, is undergoing a profound change. In the past, we not only did not have factories, but we did not even know how to make daily-use production tools, which were all bought from outside. However, as a result of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have not only learned how to smith iron and manufacture production tools, but also established many small factories. There is one factory in each village and several factories in each county. With the establishment of factories, the first batch of working class has emerged in our backward ethnic groups. This is a great joy for the people of Nujiang, unprecedented in history, and a great thing that is impossible to have.

	Due to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, people's minds have been greatly liberated, and superstitions have been eliminated. The Party's general line of socialist construction and the power of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune have liberated millions of ethnic minority women from housework and allowed them to participate in labor production like men, giving full play to their enthusiasm. The general line of socialist construction has mobilized all positive factors, developed production, and improved people's lives. Every farmer has put on cotton clothes, rain shoes, and leather shoes. Brown clothes have been replaced by cotton quilts, pain has been replaced by happiness, and tears have been replaced by smiles. How can we finish talking about all these moving examples?

	In short, everything is undergoing profound changes and development, which makes us clearly see the more happy and fulfilling socialist society in the near future. The continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction has swept away all old habits like a flood, and a thriving scene has emerged. We have not only heard about the amazing figures in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the great achievements of our country's socialist construction, but we have also seen these achievements with our own eyes. At the same time, foreign friends are also happy and encouraged by the achievements we have made.

	Why have we made such great achievements in such a short period of time? This is due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the correctness of the Party's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the great creative power of our Party relying on the 650 million people of our country. Therefore, we have achieved unprecedented great victories, and it has been fully proved in practical work that the "walking on two legs" policy formulated by our Party is completely correct. The three magic weapons of socialist construction in our country have exerted unparalleled powerful power in practical work.

	Industry and agriculture are the main sectors of the national economy. It is completely correct for our country's national economic construction to take agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor. Only with the great development of industrial and agricultural production can our country become prosperous and strong, and the worker-peasant alliance can be further consolidated. We deeply realize that the power of the 650 million people led by the Party is the decisive force for building socialism in our country and an invincible force. We will definitely be able to overfulfill the 1960 plan.

	Strengthening Study and Striving to Transform Ideology is Very Important for the Upper Strata of Ethnic Groups
	In order to adapt to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, I myself must also strengthen my study and strive to transform my own thinking, which is very important for the upper strata of ethnic groups who come from the old society. In my past studies, I have realized the following points:

	First of all, I realized that the capitalist road is impassable, and only socialism is the only correct and bright road. For this road, I must transform myself well.

	I realize that although there are different stages in the social and economic development of the interior and the border areas, the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes, regardless of the interior and the border areas, is essentially the same and stinks. Therefore, we must strengthen our own transformation. Only by studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works well can we transform our position and thinking well.

	Secondly, in the process of studying, I visited factories and people's communes and saw the workers' and peasants' soaring enthusiasm for building socialism. They displayed the communist style and invented and created everywhere, which made me deeply appreciate the greatness of the working people and the need to learn from the working people.

	I also realize that in work and study, we must always be vigilant and prevent and oppose the rumors and sabotage of imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements. I have been able to realize and appreciate these things as a result of the Party's long-term unity and education of the upper strata of ethnic groups and the victory of the Party's policies. In the future, I must continue to work hard to transform myself, invest myself in socialist construction, and better contribute my strength.
	The great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction are inseparable from the help and support of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. We are grateful for this selfless help, and at the same time, we must strengthen the unity and mutual assistance between socialist countries. The era we live in is an era in which the strength of the socialist camp is growing stronger day by day, while the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism is becoming more and more rotten. The development of Soviet science and technology has greatly surpassed that of capitalist countries. Imperialism is increasingly opposed by the people of the world, and they are being isolated in front of the people of the world. All these facts prove that Chairman Mao's conclusion that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" is completely correct. At present, the domestic and international situation is favorable to us. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will resolutely support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan.
	Finally, I wish the conference a victory and all the members good health.

### 党给怒江人民的帮助数不清说不完  裴阿欠委员的发言

专栏：

    党给怒江人民的帮助数不清说不完
    裴阿欠委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国家经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈叔通副主席关于全国政协常委会工作报告，并且衷心地拥护。
    两位副总理的报告表明了我国社会主义建设的辉煌成绩，并且指出了今后的任务，使我进一步深刻的认识到我国大跃进的伟大胜利和今后努力方向。我回忆起过去，在国民党反动统治时代，国家贫弱，受人欺凌，反动政府只会压迫搜刮人民，不管国家建设。人民只知道出钱出粮，却不知钱、粮用到什么地方。如今，全国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下，我们国家一年年兴盛，建设一年年跃进。我们从全国各地每年来一次北京开会，政府就把我国社会主义建设的情况向我们报告，并且协商社会主义建设事业，国家每年收入多少，支出多少，都给我们交代得清清楚楚。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，一切都是从人民的利益出发，一切都为社会主义建设事业。来自于人民，用之于人民，处处为六亿多人民的利益着想，真使我们感激和振奋。因此，我们必须坚决的跟着共产党和毛主席走，拥护社会主义建设三大法宝，加速我国的社会主义建设，彻底改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌。
    凭自己劳动的双手创造自己幸福的生活
    为了各民族人民共同过渡到社会主义社会，党和毛主席根据民族地区的政治、经济和文化发展的不同特点，制定了不同的方针政策。例如我们云南怒江傈僳族自治州的各民族，由于解放前长期受着反动派的压迫和剥削，政治、经济和文化各方面发展都极为落后，还保持着不少的原始残余。党和政府根据这种情况，采取了直接过渡的方针，大力帮助各族人民发展政治、经济和文化。解放几年来各方面都取得了很大的成绩，生产有了很大的发展，改善了人民生活。特别是从1958年以来，随着社会主义建设事业的大跃进，怒江傈僳族自治州也和全国一样掀起了大跃进的热潮，落后的面貌迅速地在改变着，人民群众的觉悟大大的提高了。大家认识，只有走社会主义道路才是唯一正确的道路，只有共产党才是真正代表各民族根本利益的党。因而在大跃进中，各族人民发挥了冲天的干劲，在党的领导下，凭自己劳动的双手，创造自己幸福的生活。在1958年之内就修了一千三百条水利，开了八万亩水田，因此，生产上有了很大的发展，人民生活有了显著的提高，根据1959年的情况，粮食生产平均每人达到一千五百斤，有的县如：泸水县就达到一千七百斤，这是有史以来没有过的。不但如此，在文教卫生事业方面，也有很大的发展。解放前我们怒江没有几个识字的人，如福贡和碧江两个县才有九个中学生，四个县里只有四所小学，但没有几个人念书，根本就没有医院，有病没有药吃，只能杀牲祭鬼，每年都死不少的人，有谁来关心我们各族人民的生命呢？
    解放以后，党给我们各民族办了许多学校，有小学、中学，还准备办大学，进行了扫盲，现在大大小小的人都初步的掌握了一些文化知识，怒江人民没有文化的痛苦日子一去不复返了。在卫生方面来说，除了各县各乡有许多医务所以外，在自治州机关所在地盖了一幢十八间的大瓦房，作为医院，从此有病不再杀牲祭鬼了。这一切都说明，党和人民政府给我们的帮助真是数不清、说不完、写不尽。怒江各族人民从实际中切身体会到社会主义制度的无比优越性，社会主义制度给我们带来了无限的幸福。
    幸福之路，社会主义之路
    从交通运输方面来看，也同样飞跃的发展。怒江傈僳族自治州处于祖国的边疆，山高路远，碧罗雪山上一年四季都积雪，交通非常不便，解放前每年都在雪山上冻死不少的人。但解放以后党和人民政府亲切的关怀怒江各族人民，1953年就从碧江到兰坪，在大雪山上修通了马路，从此以后再也没有冻死在大雪山上的那么悲惨的情况了。不但这样，1958年起又从剑川开始挖一条公路，准备通到怒江，这一条公路不久就要通车了。又从瓦约到碧江也挖一条公路，现在已经基本上通了。怒江各族人民亲眼看到从内地开来汽车的时候，高兴而感激的说：“共产党的好领导，怒江修通汽车路，从此走路不用脚，东西不用人来背。”怒江各族人民把这两条公路当做幸福之路，把它当做社会主义的路，真的，它将会给我们带来无限的幸福。
    在傈僳族出现了第一批工人
    怒江傈僳族自治州也和全国一样，正在经历着一个深刻的变化。过去我们不但没有工厂，连日用生产工具都不会搞，都从外面买来，但是1958年大跃进的结果，不但已经学会打铁，会制造生产工具，而且建立了许多小型的工厂，一村有一个厂，一县有几个厂。随着工厂的建立，在我们落后民族中出现了第一批工人阶级，这是怒江人民的大喜事，是历史上没有过的，也是不可能有的大好事。
    由于社会主义建设事业的大跃进，人们的思想大大的解放了，破除了迷信。党的社会主义建设总路线和大跃进、人民公社的威力把千百万的少数民族妇女从家务劳动中解放了出来，和男子一样参加了劳动生产，充分的发挥了她们的积极性。社会主义建设总路线调动了一切积极因素，发展了生产、改善了生活，每一个农民都穿上了棉衣，穿上了雨鞋和大皮鞋，棕衣被棉被代替了，痛苦被幸福代替了，眼泪被笑脸代替了，这一切动人的事例怎么能说得完呢？
    总之一切都在经历着深刻的变化和发展，使我们清楚的看到了不久的将来更加幸福美满的社会主义社会。社会主义建设的这种连续不断大跃进，它的威力像洪水一样冲走了一切旧的习气，出现了一片欣欣向荣的光景。我国社会主义建设大跃进的大成绩，我们不但听到了李富春副总理报告中惊人的数字，而且我们亲眼看到了这些成绩，同时国外的朋友也为我们所取得的成绩欢喜鼓舞。
    我们为什么在这样短的时间内取得这么大的成绩呢？这就是由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导，是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的正确，是我们党依靠了我国六亿五千万人民的伟大的创造力量。所以，取得了前所未有的伟大的胜利，在实际工作中充分的证明了我们党所制定的一套“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。我国社会主义建设的三大法宝在实际工作中发挥了无比强大的威力。
    工业和农业是国民经济中的主要的部门，我国国民经济的建设以农业为基础，以工业为主导，这是完全正确的。只有工农业生产的大发展，我们的国家才能富强起来，工农联盟也才能更加巩固。我们深深的认识到，党所领导的六亿五千万人民的力量是我国建成社会主义的决定性的力量，是不可战胜的力量，我们一定能够超额完成1960年的计划。
    加强学习　努力改造思想对民族上层非常重要
    为了适应社会主义建设的大跃进，我自己也要好好的加强学习，努力改造自己的思想，这对于一个旧社会里出来的民族上层是非常重要的。我在过去的学习中体会到以下的几点：
    首先，我认识到资本主义道路是走不通的，只有社会主义才是唯一正确的光明道路，为了这条道路，就得好好改造自己。
    我认识到内地和边疆在社会经济的发展上虽然有着不同的阶段，但是，剥削阶级的思想意识，不管内地和边疆，本质上都是一样，都是臭的，所以我们要加强改造自己。只有好好学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，才能很好地改造立场和思想。
    其次，我在学习过程中，参观了工厂和人民公社，看到了工人农民建设社会主义的冲天干劲，发挥了共产主义风格，处处发明创造，使我深深地体会到劳动人民的伟大，必须好好地向劳动人民学习。
    我还认识到，在工作和学习中，必须时刻提高警惕，防止和反对帝国主义及反革命分子的造谣破坏。我能够认识和体会到这些，是党对民族上层长期团结教育的结果，是党的政策的胜利，今后还要不断的努力改造自己投入社会主义建设中去，更好地贡献自己的力量。　
　我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成绩，是由于以苏联为首的社会主义国家对我们的帮助和支持分不开的，我们感谢这种大公无私的帮助，同时我们必须加强社会主义国家之间的团结互助。我们所处的时代是社会主义阵营的力量一天比一天强大，而以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营则一天比一天烂下去的时代。苏联科学技术的发展大大的超过了资本主义国家，帝国主义越来越受到全世界人民的反对，它们在全世界人民面前被孤立了。所有这些事实，证明了毛主席说的“东风压倒西风”的论断是完全正确的。目前，国内外的形势都对我们有利，我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，坚决拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而斗争。　
　  最后，祝大会胜利，各位委员健康。
