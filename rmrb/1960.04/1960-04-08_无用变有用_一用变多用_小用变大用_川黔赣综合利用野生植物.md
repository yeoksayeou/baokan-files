Increase Varieties, One Factory, Multiple Capabilities

Sichuan

This newspaper reports: Sichuan province's more than 40,000 wild plant processing factories are expanding from solely using wild fibers to process rayon to producing more than ten products such as starch, pulp, furfural, fertilizer powder, aromatic oils, and baking glue. This greatly increases the utilization rate of various raw materials and opens up a broad path for improving the economic value of wild plants.

The Feima People's Commune in Santai County, relying on the masses, boldly experimented and, from 100 jin of thatch, in addition to processing more than 60 jin of rayon, also extracted more than 160 jin of highly effective humic acid, more than 50 jin of fertilizer powder, more than 2 jin of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer, and more than 20 jin of edible starch. They also processed the starch into maltose, soy sauce, and other products. In this way, the value of every 100 jin of thatch increased from more than 3 yuan to more than 75 yuan. Zhong County has carried out diversification of factories, ensuring that all wild fibers are useful and nothing is wasted. While using cotton stalks, mulberry bark, etc. to manufacture rayon and pulp, they also extract baking glue, starch, furfural, alcohol, and fertilizer. The furfural extracted from the waste liquid of rayon processed from cotton stalks in Shehong County has a purity of over 92 degrees and is a good raw material for light industry and the chemical industry. Due to the implementation of comprehensive utilization, the production costs of these factories are generally reduced by more than two-thirds compared to the past, and some factories have even achieved "zero-cost" rayon.

The comprehensive utilization of wild fibers in Sichuan Province has further promoted the development of community-run industries. In many areas, a new situation has emerged with communes running factories, production teams running workshops, everyone participating, and every household processing.

Roots, Stems, Bark, and Fruits All Utilized

Guizhou

This newspaper reports: People's communes in Guizhou Province are using various wild plants to produce large quantities of fiber, starch, and chemical raw materials.

After last year's "small autumn harvest," Guizhou Province widely used wild fibers to produce large quantities of rayon, sacks, and pulp boards, and used wild starch to produce various non-staple foods. The vast majority of people's communes throughout the province have processing factories that use this raw material to make tofu, liquor, cooking oil, and pastries. Zhengan County comprehensively utilizes acorns, first using them to extract oil, with 100 jin of acorns producing 12 jin of oil; then extracting acorn powder from the oil cake to make tofu, and finally using the remaining clear residue to feed pigs. Acorn oil is as fragrant and delicious as vegetable oil and can also be used for lighting. In addition to using wild starch to make pastries, extract oil, and make alcohol, Jianhe, Zhenyuan, Rongjiang, and other counties also extract sugar from root starches. Currently, all parts of the province are using fern roots and kudzu roots to extract sugar. Wild oilseeds are also a major specialty of Guizhou. This year, the province is focusing on developing aromatic oils and cooking oils. Currently, more than 110 factories throughout the province have successfully trial-produced 27 kinds of aromatic oils, with plans to produce 15,500 dan throughout the year.

This newspaper reports: Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, is carrying out comprehensive utilization and serial processing of wild plants, giving full play to the potential of resources and equipment, so that the mass movement of agricultural and sideline product processing has begun to enter a new stage of "multi-purpose use of one item, multi-functional factory." The characteristics of this stage are: according to national needs and local possibilities, the stalks, leaves, skins, fruits, and roots of wild plants are comprehensively utilized, and the various links of processing are linked into a complete system, so that a raw material from degumming, peeling, shelling, and crushing to the production of finished products can be completely processed in one factory, realizing the serialization of mechanized and semi-mechanized production. At present, the county's main mountain product varieties can generally be processed into at least three products; some processing plants have initially realized the serial production of indigenous methods or semi-mechanized methods.

At present, the varieties with better comprehensive utilization in the county include acorns, oak peas, tung seeds, tea seeds, Litsea cubeba, etc., which can generally produce three to five items, which can increase economic value by 20% to fifteen times. Taking tung seeds as an example, in the past they were only used to extract oil, but now the oil cake after oil extraction is further used to refine gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and asphalt, and the remaining residue can also be used as coke, which has a major role and significance in solving the problem of fuel for power in mountainous areas and supporting agricultural mechanization and electrification. In terms of serial processing, the Chengguan Oil Pressing Plant, Taigong Food Factory, and Forest Chemical Plant have a relatively high degree of serialization. The Chengguan Oil Pressing Plant uses tung seeds to extract oil, from shelling, crushing, and pressing tung oil to refining gasoline, kerosene, diesel, asphalt, etc., which can all be completely processed in the factory using semi-mechanized equipment.

This year, Jianhe County plans to basically comprehensively utilize several major varieties such as tung seeds, acorns, tea seeds, pine resin, Litsea cubeba, Liquidambar bark, and fern rhizomes. And to focus on alcohol, rosin, sacks, and grease, with sugar, starch, baking glue, and pulp as the key, grasp both large and small, take into account both primary and secondary, make overall arrangements, and achieve their respective effects.

In order to promote the rapid development of comprehensive utilization and serial processing of wild plants, Jianhe County has strengthened the Party's leadership over this work, formulated an overall plan, carried out a large-scale technical innovation movement, and rationally laid out and fixed the types of existing processing plants, so that county-run, county-commune jointly-run, commune-run, and commune-team jointly-run plants can all be carried out simultaneously, while paying attention to county-run plants as the backbone and commune-run plants as the foundation. This facilitates the masses to obtain materials locally and process them locally, fully and comprehensively utilize rural labor, promote the development of commune-run industries and the technical transformation of rural areas, and is conducive to the development of diversified operations in communes.

Commercial Departments Impart Technology

Jiangxi

This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, commercial departments in Jiangxi Province are organizing the masses to process and utilize wild and miscellaneous fibers using various methods. The commercial departments of Jiangxi Province have summarized the experience of the masses and recommended more than 20 methods for processing wild fibers to people's communes in the producing areas. For example, for softer fibers such as mountain cotton bark, steaming, boiling, and other methods are used for degumming; for harder fibers with more gum, such as pig hemp vines, lime and plant ash are used for soaking and pickling. In order to summarize, promote, and impart this set of indigenous methods, the commercial departments have established many demonstration processing plants, and through methods such as "inviting in, sending out," and technical performances, have trained more than 2,400 wild fiber processing technicians for the people's communes in the producing areas.

Based on the principle of "modern methods where possible, indigenous methods where necessary," commercial departments in various localities promptly organize relevant factories to make various cotton and hemp substitutes from various processed wild and miscellaneous fibers. The Nanchang City Commercial Department has organized small-scale machine spinning equipment in the city to process a large number of canvas and wrapping cloth, which can be used as shoulder cloth, leggings, and wrapping cloth for packaging cotton, cotton cloth, and flour needed in production. In areas without machine spinning equipment, they actively use indigenous spinning and weaving equipment to weave finished products.

    无用变有用　一用变多用　小用变大用
    川黔赣综合利用野生植物
    增加品种　一厂多能
    四川
    本报讯　四川省四万多个野生植物加工厂，正在由单一的利用野生纤维加工人造棉，扩大到生产淀粉、纸浆、糠醛、肥田粉、芳香油、烤胶等十多种产品。这便大大提高了各种原料的利用率，为提高野生植物经济价值开辟了一条宽广的道路。
    三台飞马人民公社依靠群众，大胆试制，用一百斤蓑草除加工出人造棉六十多斤外，还提取出一百六十多斤肥效很高的胡敏酸、五十多斤肥田粉、两斤多氮磷钾肥和二十多斤可供食用的淀粉；他们又把淀粉加工成饴糖、酱油等产品。这样，每百斤蓑草的价值就从三元多提高到七十五元多。忠县开展一厂多样化，做到野生纤维样样有用，点滴不丢。他们用棉秆皮、桑树皮等制造人造棉和纸浆的同时，还提取烤胶、淀粉、糠醛、酒精、肥料。射洪县从棉秆皮加工人造棉废液中，提取的糠醛，纯度已达九十二度以上，是轻工和化学工业良好的原料。由于实行综合利用，这些工厂的生产成本，一般比过去降低三分之二以上，部分工厂甚至作到人造棉“无成本”。
    四川省开展野生纤维的综合利用，也进一步促进了社办工业的发展。许多地区出现了社社办厂、队队有坊、人人动手、户户加工的新局面。
    根茎皮实样样利用
    贵州
    本报讯　贵州省各地人民公社利用各种野生植物生产出大量纤维、淀粉和化工原料。
    去年“小秋收”之后，贵州省就广泛利用野生纤维，大量生产人造棉、麻袋、纸浆板，利用野生淀粉生产各种副食品。全省绝大部分人民公社都设有加工厂，利用这种原料制造豆腐、白酒、食油和糕点。正安县综合利用橡子，先用来榨油，一百斤橡子出油十二斤；然后从油饼里提出橡子粉做豆腐，最后把剩下的清渣用来喂猪。橡子油和菜油一样芬香可口，也可以用来照明。剑河、镇远、榕江等县除了用野生淀粉制糕点、榨油、制酒精以外，还在根类淀粉中提出了糖。目前全省各地正在利用蕨根、葛根提糖。野生油料也是贵州的一大特产，今年全省着重发展芳香油、食油。现在全省已有一百一十多个工厂试制成功二十七种芳香油，计划全年生产一万五千五百担。
    本报讯　贵州省剑河县开展野生植物加工综合利用和加工系列化工作，充分发挥资源和设备的潜力，使群众性的农副产品加工运动，开始进入一个“一物多用、一厂多能”的新阶段。这个阶段的特点是：根据国家需要和当地可能，对野生植物的秆、叶、皮、实、根等进行综合利用，并把加工的各个环节联成一条龙，建成比较完整的体系，使一种原料从脱胶、剥皮、脱壳、粉碎，直到制出成品，都能在一个厂内全部处理完毕，实现机械化和半机械化生产的系列化。目前，全县主要山货品种，一般至少可加工出三种产品；有些加工厂已初步实现土法的或半机械化的系列化生产。
    现在全县综合利用程度较好的品种有橡子、橡豌、桐子、茶子、山苍子等，一般可出产品三至五项，可提高经济价值20％到十五倍。以桐子来说，过去只用来榨油，现在进一步利用榨油后的油枯提炼汽油、煤油、柴油、沥青，最后剩下了渣滓还可以作焦炭，对解决山区动力用油，支援农业机械化、电气化，有重大作用和意义。在加工系列化方面，程度比较高的有城关榨油厂、台拱食品厂、林化厂等。城关榨油厂用桐子榨油，从脱壳、粉碎、榨桐油，直到提炼汽油、煤油、柴油、沥青等，都能用半机械化设备在厂内全部处理完毕。
    今年剑河县计划将桐子、橡子、茶子、松脂、山苍子、化香树皮、蕨巴根等几个主要品种，基本上全部综合利用起来。并要以酒精、松香、麻袋、油脂为纲，糖、淀粉、烤胶、纸浆为重点，大小都抓，主次兼顾，统筹安排，各收其效。
    为了促使野生植物综合利用和加工系列化工作迅速开展，剑河县加强了党对这一工作的领导，制订了全面规划，大搞技术革新运动，并对现有加工厂进行合理布局，定点，定型，使县办、县社合办、社办、社队合办同时并举，同时注意以县办厂为骨干，社办厂为基础。这样便于群众就地取材、就地加工，充分地综合利用农村劳力，促进社办工业的发展和农村的技术改造，有利于公社多种经营的开展。
    商业部门传授技术
    江西
    本报讯　江西省商业部门在各级党委的领导下，组织群众用各种方法加工和利用野杂纤维。江西省商业部门已总结群众经验，向产区各人民公社推荐了二十多种加工处理野生纤维的办法。如纤维较柔软的山棉皮等，用蒸、煮等办法脱胶；纤维较硬、胶汁较多的猪麻藤等，便用石灰、草木灰加以沤、腌处理。为了总结、推广、传授这套土办法，商业部门自办了许多示范加工厂，通过“请进来，派出去”、技术表演等办法，为产区各人民公社培训了二千四百多名野生纤维加工技术人员。
    各地商业部门对经过加工处理的各种野杂纤维，本着能“洋”则“洋”，不能“洋”则“土”的精神，及时组织有关工厂制成各种棉麻代用品。南昌市商业部门已组织市内小型的机纺设备，加工出大批帆布、包装用布，可以作生产上需用的肩布、裹腿布和包装棉花、棉布、面粉的包装用布。在没有机纺设备的地区，则积极利用土纺土织设备，织成成品。
