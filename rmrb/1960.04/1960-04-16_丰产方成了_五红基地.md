　　High-Yield Square Becomes a “Five-Red Base”

　　Quanzihuwa in the Eastern Suburb Commune of Licheng, Shandong, was originally an old alkaline slope with many ancient tombs. Now it has been built into a five-red high-yield square with ideological redness, production redness, technical redness, cultural redness, and talent cultivation redness. People work diligently and live happily here...

　　Leaving Jinan City and stepping onto the highway to Licheng, looking north, one sees large areas of high-yield wheat fields, interwoven with irrigation canals and rows of apple trees, grape vines, and poplar forests along the roads, creating a beautiful landscape of cultivated fields. The lush and strong wheat fields in the squares, green and oily, cover the land. The spring breeze blows, and the green waves ripple, like a green sea. This is the famous Quanzihuwa High-Yield Square of the Eastern Suburb People’s Commune in Licheng County, covering an area of approximately 1,200 mu.

　　This was originally an old alkaline slope with many ancient tombs. After a year and a half of hard work by Li Guilan’s "Iron Girl" team, its appearance has been completely renewed. Now, in the center of the high-yield square is a newly built simple livestock farm, teeming with piglets. To the north of the farm is a temporary field residence, with dormitories, a canteen, offices, study rooms, a club, storage rooms, a mechanical and electrical repair shop, a iron, wood, and tile repair shop, etc. The heroes living here have raised high the five red flags of ideological redness, production redness, technical redness, cultural redness, and talent cultivation redness, turning the old alkaline slope of Quanzihuwa into a "Five-Red Base." They have comprehensively equipped everything needed for the high-yield square, and carried out a complete revolution in agricultural farming systems. From plowing and sowing to cultivating and harvesting, they have initially achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization; irrigation is self-flowing and motorized, and 800 mu of wheat can be thoroughly watered in three days by simply opening the gate; the canteen uses blowers and electric stoves; transportation is by automobile, horse-drawn cart, and rubber-wheeled cart; there are also radios, wired broadcasting, electric saws, electric grinders, electric lights, and telephones. The high-yield square has now become an educational center for the Eastern Suburb Commune to cultivate laborers with socialist and communist consciousness and mastery of advanced technical and cultural knowledge.

　　The high-yield square is not only a high-yield base but also a place to train and cultivate talent. The renowned Iron Girl Team grew up here. In the autumn of 1958, when Quanzihuwa was still an alkaline wasteland, the determined and robust Li Guilan first responded to the call of the commune Party committee and led a women's plowing team to participate in the battle to reclaim wasteland, improve alkali, plow land, and sow wheat. Team leader Li Guilan, along with Dai Fuying, Xu Changying, and 30 other young women, dug earthen kilns and built thatched sheds here, fighting against nature, regardless of wind, frost, and snow, from the winter before last to the present, day after day. In 1959, the 210 mu of wheat they managed averaged 744 jin per mu, with high-yield plots yielding 1,300 jin per mu, averaging 8,000 jin of grain produced per person.

　　With the development of the high-yield square movement, Quanzihuwa now has five specialized production teams. The Iron Girl Team and the Youth Team are responsible for 800 mu of high-yield wheat, 200 mu of spring sweet potatoes, and spring corn. The Elderly Team (the oldest is around 50 years old) is responsible for 200 mu of vegetables. There is also a livestock production team managing the livestock farm, and a fertilizer accumulation and transportation team responsible for fertilizer accumulation, transportation, and supply of production and living materials, plus canteen staff and machinery repair personnel, totaling 160 people. The Youth Team and the Elderly Team moved here as early as March last year. At that time, the name of the Iron Girl was just beginning to cause a sensation in the eastern suburbs of Licheng, and the young men in the surrounding villages couldn't restrain themselves. Led by the Youth Team leader Liu Deshan, they signed up one after another to go to Quanzihuwa and compete with the Iron Girls. Middle-aged people and old men, upon hearing that a group of girls in Quanzihuwa were going to achieve high yields, were both surprised, delighted, and unconvinced, and also scrambled to come here to show off their skills. Thus began the "triangular competition." The Youth Team and the Elderly Team lost to the Iron Girl Team last year, and this year they had long ago resolved to contend. The Iron Girls, of course, were unwilling to show weakness, and they were secretly working harder.

　　The high-yield square has become a comprehensive technical school. They have established four specialized research groups: grain, vegetables, tool reform, and plant protection. They have also linked up with the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and run a technical night school. The experimental plot of the Licheng County Party Committee Secretary has also moved here, combining leading cadres, scientists, technicians, and experienced farmers to conduct a series of experiments. The Iron Girl team leader Li Guilan and the mechanical and electrical team leader Wang Yuwen have become "local experts."

　　This is also a comprehensive political and cultural school. There is a Party school, a Youth League school, and technical and cultural spare-time schools linked together, called "four schools in one," insisting on studying every evening.

　　The heroes living in the Quanzihuwa high-yield square work like tigers and wolves and, when resting, are like a field performance team, singing to their hearts' content. If it is a holiday or festival, Quanzihuwa is lively and joyous. What a happy living garden, what a warm big family!

    丰产方成了“五红基地”
    山东历城东郊公社泉子洼，原来是一片古墓成群的老碱坡，现在建成了思想红、生产红、技术红、文化红、培养人材红的五红丰产方。人们在这里勤劳地生产，幸福地生活……。
    本报记者　胡雷
    出济南市，踏上通往历城的公路，引领北望，但见一方方大面积丰产麦田，被纵横交错的灌溉渠道和路旁的苹果行、葡萄行、青杨林交织起来，绘成一幅园田化的美丽图案。方田里葱绿茁壮的麦田，绿油油的复盖着大地，春风吹来，碧波荡漾，宛如一片绿海。这便是历城县有名的东郊人民公社泉子洼丰产方，面积约一千二百亩。
    这里原是一片古墓成群的老碱坡，经过李桂兰“钢铁姑娘”队一年半的苦战，面貌已经焕然一新。现在，丰产方的中央新建的简易畜牧场，猪仔成群。场子北边，是田间临时居住点，有宿舍、食堂、办公室、学习室、俱乐部、储藏室、机电修理所、铁木瓦工修配厂等等。住在这里的英雄们，高高举起了思想红、生产红、技术红、文化红、培养人材红等五面红旗，把泉子洼老碱坡变成了“五红基地”。他们把丰产方所需要的一切配起套来，在农业耕作制度方面，来了个全面大革命。从耕地播种到中耕收获已经初步达到了机械化半机械化；灌溉是自流化、电动化，八百亩小麦，把闸门一开，三天就透透地浇一遍；食堂里使用着鼓风机、电气炉；运输是汽车、马车、胶轮车；还有收音机、有线广播、电锯、电磨、电灯、电话。丰产方现在已经成了东郊公社培养有社会主义、共产主义觉悟，掌握先进技术文化知识的劳动者的教育中心了。
    丰产方既是高产基地，又能锻炼和培养人材。赫赫闻名的钢铁姑娘队，便是从这里成长起来的。当1958年秋天，泉子洼还是一片碱荒的时候，刚毅健壮的李桂兰，首先响应公社党委的号召，带领一支妇女翻地队，参加开荒改碱翻地种麦的战斗。队长李桂兰，还有戴付英、徐长英等三十名青年姑娘，在这里挖起地窑，搭起草棚，和大自然作战，不顾风霜冰雪，从前年冬天到现在，始终如一日。1959年，她们管理的二百一十亩小麦，平均亩产七百四十四斤，高额丰产田亩产一千三百斤，平均每人生产了八千斤粮食。
    泉子洼随着丰产方运动的发展，已经有了五支专业生产队。钢铁姑娘队和青年队负责八百亩丰产麦、二百亩春地瓜和春玉米，老年队（最大是五十岁左右）负责二百亩蔬菜，还有一支畜牧生产队管理畜牧场，一支积肥运输队负责积肥运输和生产生活资料供应，加上食堂人员、机具修配人员共有一百六十人。青年队和老年队，早在去年3月间就搬来了。那时钢铁姑娘的名字，刚刚轰动历城东郊，周围村的小伙子就忍耐不住了。以青年队长刘得山为首，纷纷报名要到泉子洼和钢铁姑娘比高低。中年人和老头们听说泉子洼有一伙姑娘要闹高产，又惊又喜又不服气，也争着来这里显显本领。从此便开始了“三角竞赛”。青年队、老年队去年输给了钢铁姑娘队，今年老早就下定决心争一争。钢铁姑娘们当然不肯示弱，她们正在暗暗加劲。
    丰产方变成了一个综合性的技术学校。他们建立了粮食、蔬菜、工具改革、植物保护等四个专业研究小组，还与省农业科学院挂上钩，办了一处技术夜校。历城县委书记的试验田也搬来了，领导干部、科学家、技术员、老农四结合，进行着一系列的试验。钢铁姑娘队长李桂兰和机电组长王玉文，已经成了“土专家”。
    这里还是一个综合性的政治文化学校。有党校、团校和技术、文化业余学校联结起来，叫做“四校合一”，每天晚上坚持学习。
    生活在泉子洼丰产方的英雄们，干起活来是如狼似虎，休息时又像是一个田间演出队，尽情的歌唱。如果遇上假日或节日，泉子洼热闹欢腾。这是一个多么幸福的生活园地，多么温暖的大家庭！
