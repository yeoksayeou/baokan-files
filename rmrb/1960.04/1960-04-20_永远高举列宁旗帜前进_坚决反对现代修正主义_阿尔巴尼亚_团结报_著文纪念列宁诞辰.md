Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article on April 1st stating that revisionism remains the main danger in the international communist movement. Therefore, the task of all communist and workers' parties is to thoroughly crush modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav modern revisionism, politically and theoretically.

The article, titled "Lenin's Struggle Against Opportunism and Revisionism," was written to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth. The author is Manush, Deputy Director of the Institute of Party History of the Albanian Labor Party. He wrote: "This precious era of continuous development of Marxism and the successive victories of socialist science is linked with the name of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the working people. Lenin defended the theories of Marx and Engels in the struggle against the distortions and fabrications of the opportunists, and enriched and developed Marxism under new historical conditions."

The article stated: Lenin once pointed out that resolutely opposing opportunism and revisionism is a necessary condition for the complete victory of the working class and the socialist cause. After quoting the 1957 Moscow Conference Declaration pointing out that revisionism is the main danger at present, the author said, "The danger of revisionism lies primarily in its propagating distorted paths to the working class, believing that socialism can be spontaneous, that capitalism can gradually transition to socialism without overthrowing capitalism, without the political leadership of the working class and Marxist parties, and without the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The article stated that modern revisionism, represented by the Yugoslav revisionists, takes social democracy, Trotskyism, reformism, and anarcho-syndicalism as its sources of ideology and theory. Revisionists, especially Yugoslav revisionists, spare no effort to beautify modern imperialism and distort the essence of socialism. They attempt to belittle the international significance of the socialist construction experience of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. They try by all means to split the international communist movement and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Under the guise of criticizing "dogmatism," the Yugoslav revisionists clamor that only they are creatively developing Marxism, while all communist and workers' parties are slandered by them as so-called "dogmatic" and "stagnant" parties.

The article pointed out that the communist and workers' parties of all countries stand tall, following Lenin's teachings, and have repelled the attacks of modern revisionism. Due to the iron-like unity of the international communist movement, international modern revisionism has been crushed ideologically.

The article said that the Albanian Labor Party has always been loyal to Leninist ideas, firmly and creatively implemented Leninist ideas, and carried out the struggle against opportunism and revisionism. The Albanian Labor Party will continue to do its utmost to fight for the consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement, to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to fight against revisionism, especially against the mortal enemies of socialism and the lackeys of imperialism - the Yugoslav modern revisionists. The Albanian Labor Party will always take Marxist-Leninist theory as its guiding light and will always hold high the banner of Lenin and advance.

    永远高举列宁旗帜前进  坚决反对现代修正主义
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”著文纪念列宁诞辰
    据新华社讯　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”4月1日发表文章说，修正主义仍然是国际共产主义运动中的主要危险，因此，各国共产党、工人党的任务在于从政治上和理论上彻底粉碎现代修正主义，特别是南斯拉夫现代修正主义。
    这篇题为“列宁反对机会主义和修正主义的斗争”的文章是为纪念列宁诞辰九十周年而作的。作者是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央党史研究所副所长马努什。他写道：“马克思主义不断发展和社会主义科学节节胜利的这一宝贵的时代，是和劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师列宁的名字联系着的。列宁在同机会主义者的歪曲和捏造进行的斗争中保卫了马克思和恩格斯的学说，并且在新的历史条件下丰富和发展了马克思主义。”
    文章说：列宁曾经指出，坚决地反对机会主义和修正主义是工人阶级和社会主义事业取得彻底胜利的必要条件。作者在引述了1957年莫斯科会议宣言所指出的修正主义是当前的主要危险这样一点之后说，“修正主义的危险首先在于它向工人阶级宣传歪曲的道路，认为社会主义是可以自发的，认为不推翻资本主义、没有工人阶级和马克思主义政党的政治领导和没有无产阶级专政，资本主义可以逐渐过渡到社会主义。”
    文章中说，以南斯拉夫修正主义者为代表的现代修正主义把社会民主主义、托洛茨基主义、改良主义和无政府工团主义作为思想和理论的泉源。修正主义者、特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者，不遗余力地美化现代帝国主义，歪曲社会主义的本质。他们妄图贬低苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国的社会主义建设经验的国际意义。他们不择手段地企图分裂国际共产主义运动和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。南斯拉夫修正主义者在批判“教条主义”的幌子下叫嚣说，只有他们在创造性地发展马克思主义，而所有的共产党和工人党则被他们污蔑为所谓“教条主义”和“裹足不前”的党。
    文章指出，各国共产党、工人党遵循着列宁的学说巍然屹立，并且击退了现代修正主义的进攻。由于国际共产主义运动钢铁般的团结一致，在思想上国际现代修正主义遭到了粉碎。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党一贯忠实于列宁主义思想，坚定地并创造性地贯彻执行了列宁主义思想，进行了反对机会主义和修正主义的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党今后仍将竭尽全力为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结而斗争，为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，反对修正主义，特别是反对社会主义的死敌、帝国主义的仆从——南斯拉夫现代修正主义者而斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将永远把马克思列宁主义理论作为自己的指路明灯，并将永远高举列宁的旗帜前进。
