Beijing
Eliminate Heavy Labor and Promote Advanced Experience: A Two-Pronged Approach Leads to a Joint Celebration of Bumper Harvest
    (Our dispatch) A wave of technological innovation and revolution centered on "four modernizations" is sweeping the capital with the force of a storm.
    The technological innovation and revolution movement on Beijing's steel front is proceeding from two aspects. One is to besiege heavy manual labor; the other is to vigorously promote advanced operational experience. The two-pronged approach has resulted in a double bumper harvest. In mid-April, the comprehensive utilization coefficient of the blast furnace at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company jumped from 1.736 in the first ten days of the month to 1.937. The qualification rate of pig iron remained at 100%. The coke consumption per ton of pig iron also dropped from 712 kg in the first ten days of the month to 678 kg. The electromechanical industry system, relying on veteran workers and technicians, and through worker representatives' meetings, mechanization inspection teams and other forms, observed and studied, selected and matched, vigorously promoting the technological innovation movement in casting, forging, fitter and other types of work. Since February this year, the city's casting work has concentrated superior forces, implemented large-scale operations, and launched a fierce attack on eight manual operation procedures. At present, general factories have realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in iron smashing, charging, lifting, transportation and other processes. Various cotton textile factories, aiming at the five key points with the most manual operations, such as cotton mixing, doffing, bobbin changing, warp tying, and weft loading, have launched a fierce attack, and have achieved success in everything except warp tying. A number of automated units and automated workshops have successively appeared in the city's clothing, hat and shoe industries and the food industry.

Shandong
Promote While Experimenting, Popularize While Improving: Experiment in Promotion, Improve from Popularization
    (Our dispatch from Jinan, April 29th) The technological innovation and revolution movement in Shandong Province has now entered a new stage of summarizing, improving, and promoting.
    Since the launch of the movement, Shandong Province has put forward more than 1.3 million innovation proposals, of which 490,000 have been realized. 250,000 people have been freed from manual operation and heavy manual labor. The province has realized 895 automatic production lines and linkage lines, and more than 2,000 single-machine automation equipment.
    In the face of the new situation of technological revolution, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province, with high enthusiasm, systematically summarized the advanced experience that continued to emerge, making it complete sets and linking it into lines, while vigorously organizing promotion. At present, the province has supported more than 7,000 sets of advanced experience; of which more than 100 sets are relatively significant. In the process of promotion, it emphasized proceeding from reality, promoting comprehensively, systematically, and completely; at the same time, it regarded the process of promoting advanced experience as a process of popularizing and improving science and technology. It vigorously organized scientific research departments, universities and colleges, and production and use departments to give full play to the role of the "three combinations," promoting while experimenting, popularizing while improving; experimenting from popularization, and improving from popularization; combining learning with creation, combining popularization with improvement; and combining theory with practice; so that advanced experience can be continuously developed, improved, expanded, and improved in the process of promotion.

Ningxia
Mass Oath-Taking and Mobilization Unleash Innovation Upsurge: Technical Appearance of a Large Number of Factories and Mines Rapidly Changes
    (Our dispatch from Yinchuan, April 29th) On the eve of May Day, the technological innovation and revolution movement on the industrial and transportation front in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is galloping forward, changing rapidly; mechanized and semi-mechanized factories and mines are emerging in batches.
    In April, the "four modernizations" movement on the industrial and transportation front in Ningxia came fiercely and rapidly. Yinchuan, Shizuishan, Wuzhong, Yongning and other cities and counties successively held mass oath-taking rallies and broadcast mobilization meetings, carrying out large-scale publicity and mobilization. Yinchuan City also held an on-site meeting at the Yinchuan Machinery Repair Plant to vigorously promote the factory's experience in achieving mechanization. Then the city organized four blitz battles, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization was rapidly improved. According to the statistics of ten factories and mines in the metallurgical industry system, from April 1st to 18th, employees put forward 388 suggestions belonging to technological innovation, of which more than 25% have been realized.

Tianjin
A New Great Upsurge in the Technological Innovation Movement: Seventeen Major Advanced Experiences Blossom Everywhere
    (Our dispatch) Our newspaper and reporters from Tianjin newspapers and radio stations jointly wrote: A new technological revolution storm swept across every corner of the Tianjin industrial front. In the boiling revolutionary atmosphere, people's spiritual outlook and industrial technical outlook rapidly reached a new realm, forming a truly mass-based, conscious, and great revolutionary movement.
    Since November last year, the technological innovation and revolution movement in Tianjin has appeared in three major upsurges. Looking at the scale and progress of the three upsurges, each time was more magnificent than the last, and each time was more violent than the last; looking at the content, each time was richer than the last, and each time climbed to a higher peak. When the first upsurge was launched, it mainly focused on making great efforts in mechanization and semi-mechanization; since the beginning of this year, the content of automation and semi-automation has been added; after the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial conference in early March, the technological innovation and revolution movement centered on the "four modernizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) rapidly entered a new stage of comprehensively and systematically carrying out technological transformation of industrial enterprises.
    In this new upsurge, from modern large enterprises to small street factories, from in front of the steelmaking furnace to beside the textile machine, from auxiliary work sections to key production departments, from production workshops to employee dormitories, regardless of young or old, housewives who have just entered the factory, or old masters who are about to retire, there is no place that does not innovate, and no one who does not talk about innovation. Since mid-March, the speed of the city's mechanization and semi-mechanization level has suddenly accelerated, and the increase in the first and middle ten days of April is more than the sum of January to March.
    In the technological revolution movement, the broad masses of workers adopted various indigenous methods, proceeded from reality, and created many new technologies suitable for China's specific conditions. Xiao Dexun, a young worker at the Jinan Tannery with only elementary school education, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, boldly broke with old and established new technologies, creating new technologies that were sharply opposed to the old process theory, shortening the tanning cycle from sixteen days to two and a half days. The Municipal Party Committee launched a movement throughout the city to learn from Xiao Dexun, catch up with Xiao Dexun, and surpass Xiao Dexun, and widely promoted Xiao Dexun's experience of creating and developing new technologies based on specific conditions throughout the city as a direction. Some units where the technological revolution movement has developed relatively deeply have also made rapid progress in studying and learning to master the laws of technological development.
    In the great storm, leading cadres at all levels have also been tempered and improved their leadership skills. They have more consciously grasped the laws of the movement and stood at the forefront of the movement. They have strengthened their leadership over the movement, and constantly adjusted the relations of production and the superstructure to adapt to the development of productive forces and the new situation of the great storm. The leading cadres of the Printing and Dyeing Company went deep among the masses, and together with the workers, concentrated the innovation projects of various printing and dyeing factories, and summarized a set of experience in automation and continuous production of printing and dyeing, and then experimented in a factory to grow experimental fields. After gaining experience, they promoted it comprehensively, which fundamentally changed the technical appearance of this industry and greatly improved production. On April 15th, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting to promote their experience to the city, and made a "decision to summarize and support in the technological revolution movement, and promote advanced experience." All walks of life in the city immediately launched an upsurge of supporting each other and promoting advanced experience. The Textile Industry Bureau put forward the slogan "Single experience is not outdated, complete sets of experience do not stay overnight" in the seven-day battle, and promoted 100 advanced experiences in seven days. Factories and enterprises are vigorously promoting seventeen major advanced experiences from this city and other places. At present, many experiences have blossomed and borne fruit over a large area.

Nanchang
Ideological Revolution Brought About Technological Revolution: Technological Revolution Promoted Production Leap Forward
    (Our dispatch from Nanchang, April 29th) While strengthening the leadership of the technological revolution movement, the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to twist the ideological revolution, the technological revolution and the great upsurge in production into one rope.
    In the first three months of this year, the industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments in Nanchang City put forward more than 30,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 7,300 have been realized.
    The Nanchang City Technological Revolution Movement has achieved such brilliant achievements in a short period of time. In addition to the reasons such as the leadership grasping tightly and grasping early, emphasizing politics in command, and emphasizing the study and publicity of Mao Zedong Thought, it is an important reason for the smooth development of the movement. The departments of the Municipal Party Committee have all appointed a deputy minister, and the factories, enterprises and communes have all appointed a deputy secretary to specifically lead the Mao Zedong Thought study movement. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the city's workers have established the idea of ​​continuous revolution and created many miracles of "making a revolution in three days" and "turning over a great body in one night."
    While launching a new upsurge of technological innovation, the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also taken many effective measures to promote technological innovation and production to be closely twisted into one rope and promote each other. First, in various factories and enterprises, with examples of mutual promotion between innovation and production, employees are educated to unify innovation and production ideologically and clarify that the purpose of innovation is to develop production. Second, in accordance with the long-term plan for technological revolution of each unit, combined with the specific situation and needs of production, arrangements should be made to unify innovation and production in terms of organizational leadership and deployment. Third, with the continuous innovation of technology and the continuous expansion of production capacity, in the arrangement of production, the production of tools, equipment, raw materials and other products necessary for technological innovation should be prioritized. Fourth, adhere to the implementation of the "three combinations" inside and outside the factory, and widely organize communist large-scale cooperation. After each factory adopted the above methods, a new situation of close integration, mutual promotion, and double leap forward between innovation and production emerged.

Baotou
Mobilize the Masses for Large-Scale Evaluation, Large-Scale Summary, and Large-Scale Tree-Planting Models: Seek Materials, Transportation Capacity, and Labor from the Technological Revolution
    (According to Xinhua News Agency, Baotou) The technological innovation and revolution movement in the Baotou industrial base has entered a new stage of large-scale mass movement centered on the gradual realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation from single and scattered innovation in an organized and planned way.
    In this new stage, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires factories and mining enterprises to focus on summarizing experience, grasping new problems, vigorously engaging in self-reliance and integrating indigenous and foreign methods, and grasping planning on the basis of the great achievements made in the previous stage, in order to consolidate existing achievements, ensure the continuous and in-depth development of the movement, and successfully complete the production and construction tasks in the second quarter and achieve a continuous leap forward throughout the year.
    At present, factories, mines and scientific research institutions throughout the city are deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out large-scale evaluations, large-scale summaries, and large-scale tree-planting models.
    The technological innovation achievements in Baotou in the previous stage were enormous. In just two months, the city put forward more than 1,548,800 innovation proposals and realized more than 347,000 of them, which is about three times the number of proposals realized throughout last year, freeing more than 30,000 workers from heavy manual labor. Under the technological innovation and revolution movement, the city has overfulfilled the first quarter's total industrial output value plan by 7.4%, breaking the routine of previous years. This year, the progress of production and construction in the Baotou industrial base has accelerated, and materials, transportation, labor, electricity, etc. are all relatively tight. Workers in various units launched activities to seek materials, transportation capacity, labor, and electricity from technological innovation and revolution. Baotou Iron and Steel Company and the Second Engineering Bureau of the Construction Engineering Department, through revising plans and manufacturing wet-ground slag concrete to replace cement and other methods, have tried every means to increase production and save materials, saving 23,747 tons of steel, 4,256 cubic meters of wood, and 6,484 tons of cement in the first quarter alone. This has played a great role in ensuring key projects, especially in ensuring the construction of the Baogang No. 1 open-hearth furnace system project.

Luoyang
Engage in Technical Performance Competitions and Open Experience Supporting Meetings: More Than 7,000 Innovation Achievements are Supporting Each Other
    (Our dispatch from Zhengzhou, April 29th) The technological innovation and revolution movement in Luoyang City, Henan Province, has been pushed to a wider and deeper new stage through large-scale summary, large-scale improvement, large-scale supporting, and large-scale promotion.
    The "four modernizations" movement in Luoyang City, after level-by-level planning, strengthening leadership, and continuously carrying out several battles, by the end of March, the city had already had 54 automated and semi-automated workshops and work departments; 253 automatic production lines; 126 linkage lines; 5,606 automated and semi-automated single machines. 19,700 people have been freed from manual operation and heavy manual labor.
    In order to further consolidate innovation achievements, the Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all walks of life in the city to conduct summary and supporting from top to bottom, from thought to technology. Many enterprises responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, and through technical performance competitions, production sports meetings, experience supporting meetings and other forms, concentrated, lined up, fully compared, summarized and finalized, and matched the advanced technologies and advanced experiences of a workshop, a type of work, a factory, and even the entire industry system of the city into a dragon into a complete set. In the recent period of less than a month, among the more than 170,000 innovations that have been realized in the city, more than 7,500 have been supported and promoted; and more than 1,100 have been officially included in the process. The 15 factories in the clothing industry in the Luobei District, through technical performances, summarized and promoted a set of 78 innovation projects from measuring clothes, cutting, to nailing buttons and locking buttonholes, and the entire industry has basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    本报银川29日电　“五一”前夕，宁夏回族自治区工业交通战线技术革新和技术革命运动奔驰直上，瞬息万变；机械化、半机械化的厂矿成批涌现。
    4月份，宁夏工业交通战线上的“四化”运动来势又猛又快。银川、石咀山、吴忠、永宁等市、县先后召开了万人誓师大会、广播动员大会，大张旗鼓地进行了宣传动员。银川市还在银川机械修配厂召开了现场会议，大力推广了这个厂实现机械化的经验。接着全市又组织了四次突击战役，机械化、半机械化程度得到了迅速提高。据冶金工业系统十个厂矿的统计，4月1日到18日，职工提出的属于技术革新的建议三百八十八件，已实现了25％以上。
    天津
    技术革新运动出现新的大高潮  十七项重大先进经验到处开花
    本报讯　本报和天津市报纸、电台记者联合采写：一个新的技术革命大风暴弥天漫地，席卷天津市工业战线各个角落。在沸腾的革命气息中，人们的精神面貌和工业技术面貌迅速达到一个新的境界，形成了真正群众性的自觉的伟大革命运动。
    自从去年11月以来，天津市的技术革新和技术革命运动已经出现了三次大高潮。从三次高潮的规模和进展情况来看，一次比一次壮阔，一次比一次猛烈；从内容来看，也是一次比一次丰富，一次比一次迈上更高峰。第一次高潮掀起时，主要是以大闹机械化、半机械化为中心；今年以来又增加了自动化、半自动化的内容；3月初中共天津市委召开工业会议以后，以“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动迅速跨入了全面、系统地对工业企业进行技术改造的新阶段。
    在这个新高潮中，由现代化大企业到街道小工厂，由炼钢炉前到纺织机旁，由辅助工段到生产要害部门，由生产车间到职工宿舍，不论青年老年，进厂不久的家庭妇女，快要退休的老师傅，无处不闹革新，无人不谈革新。由3月中旬开始，全市机械化、半机械化水平上升速度骤然加剧，4月上中旬上升数字比1至3月的总和还多。
    在技术革命运动中，广大职工采用各种土办法，从实际出发，创造出许多适合我国具体条件的新技术。只有小学程度的津南制革厂青年工人萧德训，在党的领导和群众的支持下，大胆破旧立新，创造了和旧的工艺理论针锋相对的新技术，使制革周期由十六天缩短为两天半。市委在全市开展了一个学萧德训、赶萧德训、超萧德训运动，把萧德训从具体条件出发，创造和发展新技术的经验作为一个方向，在全市广泛推广。一些技术革命运动发展比较深入的单位，在研究和学会掌握技术发展规律这方面进展也很快。
    在大风暴里，各级领导干部也受到了锻炼，提高了领导艺术。他们更加自觉地掌握运动规律，站到运动的最前列。加强对运动的领导，不断调整生产关系和上层建筑，适应生产力的发展和大风暴的新形势。印染公司领导干部深入到群众中去，和工人一起集中各印染厂的革新项目，总结出一套印染生产自动化、连续化的经验，然后在一个工厂种试验田。取得经验以后又全面推广，使这个行业的技术面貌发生了根本性的变化，生产大大提高。中共天津市委在4月15日召开现场会议，向全市推广了他们的经验，并且做出了“在技术革命运动中总结配套，推广先进经验的决定”。全市各行各业立即掀起了配套成龙、推广先进经验的热潮。纺织工业局在七天大会战中，提出了“单项经验不过时，成套经验不过夜”的口号，七天之间推广了一百项先进经验。各工厂企业正雷厉风行地推广本市和外埠的十七项重大先进经验。目前，不少经验已经大面积开花结果。
    南昌
    思想革命带来了技术革命  技术革命推动了生产跃进
    本报南昌29日电　中共南昌市委在加强技术革命运动领导的同时，提出了把思想革命、技术革命和生产大高涨拧成一条绳。
    南昌市今年头三个月内，工业、交通、基本建设各部门提出的革新建议达三万余项，已经实现的计有七千三百多项。
    南昌市技术革命运动在短时间内取得这样辉煌的成就，除了领导抓得紧抓得早等原因外，强调政治挂帅，强调学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是运动顺利开展的一个重要原因。市委各部门都指定了一名副部长，工厂企业和公社都指定了一名副书记，具体领导开展毛泽东思想学习运动。全市职工在毛泽东思想的指引下，树立了不断革命的思想，创造了许多“三天革个命”，“一夜大翻身”的奇迹。
    中共南昌市委在掀起新的技术革新高潮的同时，还采取了许多有效措施，促使技术革新与生产紧紧拧成一股绳，互相促进。首先在各工厂企业中，用革新与生产互相促进的事例，教育职工从思想上把革新和生产统一起来，明确革新的目的是为了发展生产。第二、按照各单位技术革命的长远规划，结合生产的具体情况和需要，作好安排，使之从组织领导和部署上把革新和生产统一起来。第三、随着技术的不断革新，生产能力的不断扩大，在生产的安排上，则尽先满足技术革新所必需的工具、设备、原材料等产品的生产。第四、坚持实行厂内厂外三结合，广泛组织共产主义大协作。各厂在采取上述办法后，都出现了革新与生产密切结合，互相推动，双双跃进的新面貌。
    包头
    发动群众大评比大总结大树标兵  向技术革命要材料、运输力、劳力
    据新华社包头电　包头工业基地的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经由单项、零散的革新进入有组织、有计划地以逐步实现机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化为中心的大规模群众运动的新阶段。
    在这个新阶段里，中共包头市委要求各厂矿企业在前一阶段取得巨大成就的基础上，大抓经验总结，大抓新问题，大搞自力更生、土洋并举，大抓规划，以巩固既有成果，保证运动持续深入发展，胜利地完成第二季度生产建设任务和实现全年的持续跃进。
    目前，全市各厂矿和科学研究机关正在深入发动群众，开展大评比、大总结，大树标兵。
    包头市前一阶段的技术革新成就巨大。仅在两个月的时间内，全市就提出革新建议一百五十四万八千多件，实现了三十四万七千多件，大约相当于去年全年实现的建议的三倍，使三万多职工从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。在技术革新和技术革命运动之下，全市已经超额7.4％完成了一季度工业总产值计划，打破历年来的常规。今年包头工业基地的生产建设进度加快，材料、运输、劳动力、电力等都比较紧张。各单位职工展开了向技术革新和技术革命要材料、要运输力、要劳动力、要电力的活动。包头钢铁公司和建筑工程部第二工程局通过修改计划，制造湿碾矿渣混凝土代替水泥等办法，千方百计增产节约材料，仅在第一季度就节约了钢材二万三千七百四十七吨、木材四千二百五十六立方米、水泥六千四百八十四吨。这对保证重点工程，特别是对保证包钢一号平炉系统工程的施工起了很大作用。
