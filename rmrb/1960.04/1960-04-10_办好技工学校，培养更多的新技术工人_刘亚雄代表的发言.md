I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and I will resolutely implement them in my practical work.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "In order to meet the needs of the continued leap forward in production and construction, we must strengthen the training of new workers." Now, I would like to offer some personal opinions on this issue, mainly concerning the training of new workers by technical schools.

A New Type of Vocational Technical School

Technical schools are a new type of vocational technical school, and along with the apprenticeship system, they are an important form for our country to train new skilled workers. Technical schools include those for industry, construction, transportation, and other industries; there are those run by local governments, those run by industrial departments, and those attached to enterprises. The technical school system lasts for three or two years, enrolling junior high or higher primary school graduates. In accordance with the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, work-study programs are implemented to cultivate new skilled workers with socialist and communist consciousness, specialized skills, and a medium level of education. In the past ten years, technical schools have trained more than 200,000 new workers for the country, and this new force has become a backbone of production in enterprises. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of technical schools has been rapid and even healthier. By the end of 1959, the number of technical schools nationwide had increased to 744, with more than 280,000 students, offering more than 150 types of work and specialties. A few provinces and autonomous regions that did not have such schools in previous years have now also established them. In some provinces, such as Henan, counties and people's communes have also established technical schools. This flourishing situation of technical schools reflects the urgent demand of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy for replenishing new skilled workers. It is foreseeable that with the continued leap forward in our country's production and construction, technical schools will surely have even greater development.

Close Integration of Education and Productive Labor

The most prominent feature of technical schools is the close integration of education and productive labor. Technical schools are both schools and factories; students study and work at the same time. On the one hand, technical schools have a certain length of schooling, offering courses in politics, language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and specialized technical theory, enabling students to reach a level no lower than that of high school or junior high school graduates in several basic courses (students entering with a junior high school education reach the high school graduate level; students entering with a higher primary school education reach the junior high school level), and to have the technical theoretical knowledge of the type of work or specialty they are engaged in. On the other hand, technical schools have their own practice factories or practice workshops, with necessary machines and equipment, and students frequently engage in productive labor, both learning operational skills and creating wealth for the country. The work-study program of technical schools generally adopts the "three-three system" (three days of classes, three days of labor), a few adopt the "four-two system", and some have different class hour allocations depending on the grade level. In general, whether it is class time or labor time, neither is less than 40% or more than 60% of the total class time. In this way, technical schools more thoroughly achieve the combination of education and productive labor.

Both Cultivating Technical Talents and Popularizing Secondary Education

Because education and productive labor are closely integrated, the new workers trained by technical schools are of higher quality and more in line with the requirements of all-round development. From the ideological point of view, through a series of ideological and political education and genuinely participating in productive labor, students understand the principle that labor creates the world, recognize that labor is a supremely glorious thing, develop habits of diligence and hard work, and a collectivist spirit of unity and cooperation. Their ideological awareness is relatively healthy, and their political consciousness is relatively high. In terms of operational skills, technical schools can produce everything from simple parts and tools to complex and precise machines and instruments. Students master relatively comprehensive and skilled techniques in their own specialties (rather than being limited to certain processes). They can generally reach the level of intermediate skilled workers. In terms of technical theory, students who were recruited at junior middle school level can generally reach the level of junior technician. Their understanding is deeper when they learn theory in connection with production practice. In terms of basic cultural knowledge such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, what they learn is no less than, and even exceeds, the level of ordinary middle schools, because technical schools streamline part of the middle school curriculum, focus on studying several courses, and study in combination with practical application, so their academic performance is better. In this way, technical schools not only cultivate new skilled workers with socialist and communist consciousness, specialized skills, and a medium level of education, but also provide a way and an aspect to popularize secondary education. Many graduates of technical schools have become advanced producers and labor models, and many have been promoted to cadres. According to a survey of 14,186 technical school graduates in 31 enterprises, 3,916 were rated as advanced producers or labor models, and 1,994 were promoted to team leaders, section chiefs, technicians, and workshop directors. In the surging movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, technical schools are also a very active force. Some important innovations and creations come from the hands of these young people. The gyro stabilizer successfully trial-produced by Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School was exhibited at the Leipzig Fair. One of the new products of China's machine tool industry, the S28 precision lathe, was manufactured by the Third Technical School of the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau. With the large increase in modern enterprises in our country and the rapid improvement of production technology, the demand for new skilled workers with relatively comprehensive development, such as technical school graduates, will inevitably become greater and greater.

Developing Production, Creating Wealth, and Achieving Financial Self-Sufficiency

Because education and productive labor are closely integrated, technical schools not only cultivate talents, but also create many products for society and wealth for the country. The production capacity of technical schools is generally not lower than that of factories with the same conditions in the same region. In 1958, according to the statistics of 144 technical schools with independent economic accounting, the total output value reached 127.7 million yuan; in 1959, according to the statistics of 388 schools with independent economic accounting, the total output value reached more than 200 million yuan. The products of technical schools include various metal cutting machine tools, metallurgical and power equipment, mining machinery, precision instruments, meters, and gauges, etc. Some technical schools that were established earlier and have a better foundation have considerable production capacity. Last year, the second and third technical schools affiliated to the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau produced 1,645 various metal cutting machine tools; Nanchang Aviation Technical School produced 535 lathes and 1,200 motors; Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School produced 3,000 motors and 200 lathes; the various machine tools produced by the first and second technical schools affiliated to the Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau accounted for 12% of the city's total annual machine tool production. The annual output value of these schools reached five to six million yuan, and some nearly ten million yuan. Many newly built technical schools, even those belonging to special counties, also have considerable production capacity, becoming important production units of local industry. The Nanyang Special District Technical School in Henan Province was established in the winter of 1958. The output value of this school in 1959 reached 1.2 million yuan, with more than 20 kinds and several thousand units (pieces) of products, including 150 five-horsepower water pumps, 16 six-foot tower wheel lathes, 861 CH-12A bench drills, 26 jaw crushers, 623 various vises, Beijing-style steel mills, 4K-8A water pumps, vertical lathes, earth boring machines, etc. These machines and tools played a significant role in developing local industrial and agricultural production. The Nanyang Prefectural Committee regarded this school not only as an important base for training new technicians, but also as one of the key factories, with a prefectural committee secretary concurrently serving as the principal.

On the basis of developing production, technical schools achieve financial self-sufficiency. Now, the old schools established before 1958 have already achieved or basically achieved financial self-sufficiency, without the need for state subsidies, and some schools even have a surplus. The hundreds of newly built schools with independent economic accounting in 1958 and 1959 can also achieve financial self-sufficiency to varying degrees (of which two-thirds can be more than half self-sufficient). The state only needs to subsidize a portion. Those schools with a surplus either expand the scale of the school, or promote the communist spirit of cooperation, and allocate equipment and funds to support the establishment of new schools, which people call "hens laying eggs."

Technical schools combine education with productive labor, achieve financial self-sufficiency, do not require the state to spend money, but cultivate talents, popularize education, and create wealth for the country, which is certainly a very good thing.

Labor Construction, Thrifty Schooling, Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Vigorously Running Technical Schools

The development of technical schools was not very healthy from the beginning. Before 1958, it had taken a detour. At that time, schools emphasized standardization, greed for large scale and novelty, and valued foreign methods over indigenous ones. The investment in basic construction and machinery and equipment for opening a technical school with a scale of five or six hundred people generally required two to three million yuan. Schools were not opened and production was not started until they were completed. When classes were opened and production started, there was a strong tendency of dogmatism in teaching, and much of the time for production practice was not used to produce finished products, but only consumed raw materials as a pure technical exercise. It cost the state one thousand to one thousand five hundred yuan to train a new worker. The development of schools was also slow, and by the end of 1957, there were only more than 140 technical schools in the country. At that time, the work of technical schools was characterized by slowness, low efficiency, high cost, and desolation. It was not until the arrival of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and the Party Central Committee issued instructions on education work, that we vigorously publicized and promoted the advanced experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School in adhering to thrift in running schools, overcame various shortcomings in the work of technical schools, and truly combined education with productive labor, advocating labor construction, combining indigenous and foreign methods, reforming teaching, vigorously grasping production, and emphasizing self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Only then did technical schools embark on a new stage of rapid, good, and economical development.

In the two years of 1958 and 1959, more than 670 technical schools were newly built nationwide, four times the total number of schools built in the eight years before 1958. The general start-up cost for these newly built technical schools was only two to three hundred thousand yuan, and some only used tens of thousands of yuan. The teaching quality of both old and new technical schools has been significantly improved, production has also been improved, and financial self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency has been generally achieved.

Here, I would like to introduce the practice of Henan Province in particular.

Under the correct leadership of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and party committees at all levels, Henan Province has adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously carried out mass movements, did not blindly believe in foreign methods, valued indigenous methods, made the best of simple means, built schools through labor, implemented work-study programs, vigorously grasped production. In the two years of 1958 and 1959, the province, special districts, counties, and communes newly built a total of 59 technical schools (there were only nine at the end of 1957), with a total investment of only 5.52 million yuan, averaging less than 100,000 yuan per school. The planned investment for the 232 schools to be opened this year is 16.8 million yuan, which is even less. They have adopted the method of old schools supporting and contracting to build new schools, building schools, attending classes, and producing at the same time, gradually building, gradually improving, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and progressing from indigenous to foreign. Newly built schools can generally achieve financial self-sufficiency in about one year, and some schools can even achieve it in only five or six months. The Luoyang Municipal Labor Bureau Technical School was only established in September and October last year, and by the end of February this year, it had already achieved a surplus of financial self-sufficiency. This practice of Henan Province is very worthy of promotion.

A Few Suggestions

It is undoubtedly certain that technical schools, which do not require the state to spend much money but can cultivate talents, popularize education, and create wealth, must continue to develop in large numbers. In order to run technical schools better, I think there are several issues that need attention: First, technical schools must continue to resolutely implement the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor; Second, under the leadership of the Party, technical schools must adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and do a good job in school construction, teaching, production and other tasks; Third, resolutely implement the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift, advocate labor construction, combining indigenous and foreign methods, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency; Fourth, it is necessary to run technical normal schools and organize spare-time advanced studies, to cultivate and improve the teachers of technical schools in a planned way; Fifth, select existing good textbooks, organize and edit various complete sets of textbooks; Sixth, the production plan of technical schools must be incorporated into the local production plan; Seventh, the enrollment of technical schools should be included in the local unified enrollment plan together with agricultural middle schools and other secondary specialized schools; Eighth, in order to adapt to the needs of the vigorous development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements and the rapid increase in the degree of mechanization in enterprises, more electromechanical workers should be trained in the future.

专栏：

    办好技工学校，培养更多的新技术工人
    刘亚雄代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的报告，并且要在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“为了适应生产建设继续跃进的需要，必须加强新工人的培养训练工作。”现在，我也想就这个问题，主要是技工学校培养新工人的问题，谈一点个人的意见。
    一种新型的职业技术学校
    技工学校是一种新型的职业技术学校，它和学徒制度同是我国培养新技术工人的重要形式。技工学校有工业的、建筑业的、运输业的、以及其他行业的；有地方办的，也有产业部门办的和企业附设的。技工学校的学制三年或二年，招收初中或高小毕业生，根据教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实行勤工俭学，半工半读，培养有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的、有专门技能和有中等文化程度的新技术工人。在过去十年中，技工学校为国家培养了二十多万名新工人，这批新生力量已经成为企业中的一部分生产骨干。1958年大跃进以来，技工学校的发展既十分迅速，又更加健康。截至1959年底，全国的技工学校已经增加到七百四十四所，学生二十八万多人，设置的工种和专业达一百五十多个。前几年还没有这种学校的少数省和自治区，现在也办起来了。在有的省，例如河南省，县和人民公社也办起了技工学校。技工学校蓬勃发展的这种情况，正是反映了国民经济大跃进对于补充新技术工人的迫切要求。可以预料，随着我国生产建设事业的继续跃进，技工学校一定还要有更大的发展。
    教育与生产劳动紧密结合
    技工学校的最突出的特点，是教育和劳动生产紧密地结合。技工学校既是学校，又是工厂；学生边读书，边做工。技工学校一方面有一定的学制，设置政治、语文、数、理、化和专业技术理论等课程，能够使学生在几种基础课程方面达到不低于高中或初中毕业生的水平
  （入学时是初中毕业生的，达到高中毕业的水平；入学时是高小毕业生的，达到初中毕业的水平），并且具有所从事的工种、专业的技术理论知识。另一方面，技工学校都有自己的实习工厂或者实习车间，有必要的机器和设备，学生经常从事生产劳动，既学习操作技能，又为国家创造财富。技工学校的半工半读，一般采取“三三制”（三天上课，三天劳动），少数采取“四二制”，也有随年级的不同而作不同的课时分配的。总的说来，不论上课时间或者劳动时间，都少不过占全部课时的40％，多不过占全部课时的60％。这样，技工学校更彻底地做到了教育和生产劳动相结合。
    既是培养技术人材，又是普及中等教育
    由于教育和生产劳动紧密结合，因此，技工学校培养出来的新工人，质量就更高一些，更符合全面发展的要求。从思想方面来说，经过一系列的思想政治教育和实实在在地参加生产劳动，学生们懂得了劳动创造世界的道理，认识到劳动是一件无尚光荣的事情，养成了勤劳刻苦的习惯和团结协作的集体主义精神，思想意识比较健康，政治觉悟是比较高的。从操作技能方面来说，技工学校从简单的零件、工具到复杂的精密的机器、仪表，都能够生产，学生们在自己的专业方面掌握了比较全面的熟练技术（而不是只限于某些工序的工作），一般可以达到中级技术工人的水平。从技术理论方面来说，如招收初中程度的学生，一般可以达到初级技术员的水平，他们结合生产实践来学理论，领会是更深刻的。从数理化等基础文化知识方面来说，他们所学到的也不亚于甚至还超过了普通中学的程度，因为技工学校精简了一部分中学课程，集中地学习几门课程，并且是结合实用来学习，所以学习成绩是比较好的。这样，技工学校既培养了有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的、有专门技能和有中等文化程度的新技术工人，同时又是普及中等教育的一种办法，一个方面。历届技工学校的毕业生，有许多人已经成为先进生产者和劳动模范，还有不少人被提拔为干部。根据对三十一个企业中的一万四千一百八十六名技工学校毕业生的调查，其中有三千九百一十六人被评为先进生产者或劳动模范，有一千九百九十四人被提拔为组长、工段长、技术员和车间主任。在风起云涌的技术革新和技术革命运动中，技工学校也是一支十分活跃的力量，有些重要的革新和创造，是出自那些青年人之手。西安第一航空技工学校试制成功的陀螺平衡仪，曾经在来比锡博览会上展览过。我国机床工业的新产品之一——S28型精密车床，是上海市劳动局第三技工学校制造的。随着我国现代化企业的大量增加和生产技术的迅速提高，像技工学校毕业生这样的比较全面发展的新技术工人，需要是必然会越来越大的。
    发展生产，创造财富，经费自给
    由于教育与生产劳动紧密结合，因此，技工学校不仅培养了人材，还为社会创造了许多产品，为国家创造了财富。技工学校的生产能力，一般不低于同一地区条件相同的工厂。1958年，根据有单独经济核算的一百四十四所技工学校的统计，生产总值达到一亿二千七百万元；1959年，根据有单独经济核算的三百八十八所学校的统计，生产总值达到二亿多元。技工学校的产品中，包括各种金属切削机床，冶金和电力设备，矿山机械，精密仪器、仪表，以及工夹量具等等。有些建校较早基础较好的技工学校，生产能力相当可观。去年，上海市劳动局所属的第二、第三两所技工学校，生产了各种金属切削机床一千六百四十五台；南昌航空技工学校生产了车床五百三十五台，马达一千二百台；西安第一航空技工学校生产了电动机三千台，车床二百台；天津市劳动局所属的第一、第二两所技工学校生产的各种机床，占全市全年机床生产总数的12％。这些学校的年产值都达到五、六百万元，有的近一千万元。许多新建的甚至是专县所属的技工学校，生产能力也不小，成为地方工业的重要生产单位。河南省南阳专区技工学校，是1958年冬办起来的，这个学校1959年的产值达一百二十万元，产品有二十多种，几千台（件），其中有五时水泵一百五十台，六尺塔轮车床十六台，CH—12A台钻八百六十一台，鄂式破碎机二十六台，各式虎钳六百二十三台，北京式钢磨、4K—8A水泵、立式车床、土搪床等十台，以及其他工具。这些机器、工具对于发展当地工农业生产，起了很大的作用。南阳地委把这个学校不仅当成是培养新技工的重要基地，还把它作为重点工厂之一，由一位地委书记兼任了校长。
    在发展生产的基础上，技工学校实现经费自给。现在，1958年以前建立的老校，都已经实现了或者基本上实现了经费自给，不要国家补贴，有的学校并且还自给有余；1958年和1959年新建的有单独经济核算的几百所学校，也都能够在不同程度上实现经费自给（其中能够自给一半以上的占三分之二）。国家只须补贴一部分。那些自给有余的学校，或则扩大了学校的规模，或则发扬共产主义协作精神，拨出设备、经费去支援建立新校，人们把这叫做“母鸡下蛋”。
    技工学校教育与劳动生产相结合，经费自给，不要国家拿钱，而为国家培养人材，普及教育，又创造了财富，这当然是一桩非常好的事情。
    劳动建校，勤俭办学，土洋并举，大办技校
    技工学校并不是一开始就很健康地发展的。在1958年以前，曾经走过一段弯路。那时，办校强调正规，贪大求新，重洋轻土。开办一所规模为五、六百人的技工学校，基本建设和机器设备的投资，一般就要用二、三百万元。学校不建成，就不开课，不生产。等到开课生产了，教学工作中有浓厚的教条主义，生产实习的许多时间不生产成品，而只消耗原料材料，作为一种单纯的技巧练习。培养一名新工人，国家要花一千到一千五百元。学校的发展也缓慢，到1957年底，全国才只有技工学校一百四十多所。当时，技工学校工作还是一种少慢差费、冷冷清清的情况。直到社会主义建设大跃进到来，党中央又发出了关于教育工作的指示，我们才大张旗鼓地宣传和推广了西安第一航空技工学校坚持勤俭办学的先进经验，克服了技工学校工作中的种种缺点，真正地把教育与生产劳动紧密地结合起来，提倡劳动建校，土洋并举，进行改革教学，大抓生产，重视自力更生，自给自足，这才使技工学校走上了多快好省、蓬勃发展的新阶段。
    在1958年和1959年两年中间，全国新建了技工学校六百七十多所，为1958年以前八年中所建的学校总数的四倍。这些新建的技工学校，一般开办费只要二、三十万元就够了，有的只用了几万元。老的和新的技工学校的教学质量都显著地提高了，生产也搞好了，普遍地实现了经费自给或者半自给。
    这里，特别要介绍一下河南省的作法。
    河南省在省委和各级党委的正确领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不迷信洋办法，看得起土办法，因陋就简，劳动建校，勤工俭学，大抓生产，在1958年和1959年两年内，省、专、县、社共新建了技工学校五十九所（1957年底只有九所），总投资才用了五百五十二万元，平均每所学校投资不到十万元。今年计划开办的二百三十二所学校，总投资一千六百八十万元，花费就更少了。他们采取了老校支援、包建新校的办法，边建校，边上课，边生产，逐步建成，逐步提高，土洋结合，由土到洋。新建学校一般在一年左右的时间内，有的学校甚至只要五、六个月，就能够实现经费自给。洛阳市劳动局技工学校去年9、10月间才筹建，到今年2月底就已经做到经费自给有余。河南省的这种作法，是很值得推广的。
          几点建议
    技工学校这种既不要国家多花钱，而能够培养人材、普及教育、创造财富的学校，还必须继续大量发展，这是肯定无疑的。为了把技工学校办得更好，我想有几个问题是需要注意的：第一，技工学校必须继续坚决贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针；第二，技工学校必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，做好建校、教学、生产等工作；第三，坚决贯彻执行勤俭办学的方针，提倡劳动建校，土洋结合，自力更生，自给自足；第四，要举办技工师范学校和组织业余进修，有计划地培养和提高技工学校的师资；第五，选择现有的好的教材，整理编辑出各种成套的课本；第六，技工学校的生产计划，必须纳入当地的生产计划之内；第七，技工学校招生，应该同农业中学和其他中等专业学校一起，纳入当地的统一招生计划；第八，适应技术革新和技术革命运动猛烈开展、企业中机械化程度迅速提高的需要，今后应该更多地培养机电工人。
