    The Chinese people, together with the Asian-African people, warmly commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. Five years ago, twenty-nine Asian-African countries held their first conference without the participation of colonial powers, solemnly issued a declaration of war against imperialism and colonialism by the Asian-African people, who account for more than half of the world's population, and advocated the ten principles of peaceful coexistence. This was a major sign of the unprecedented awakening of the Asian-African people who had suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism and colonialism, and a milestone in the in-depth development of the great struggle of the Asian-African people for peace, independence, freedom, and friendly cooperation. Over the past five years, under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind and under the encouragement and promotion of the Bandung spirit, the national independence movement in the Asian-African region has greatly developed, and the unity, cooperation, and friendly ties between Asian-African countries and people have been continuously strengthened and expanded, and the imperialist colonial system has been further disintegrated. The historical significance of the Bandung Conference has become increasingly significant, and the vitality of the Bandung spirit has become increasingly abundant. Looking back at the extraordinary journey of the Asian-African people over the past five years, and looking forward to the excellent situation facing the Asian-African people, it is exciting to feel that the prospects for the liberation cause of the Asian-African people are limitless.
    The call against imperialism and colonialism issued by the Bandung Conference has resonated throughout the vast areas of Asia and Africa over the past five years. Over the past five years, the struggle of the Asian-African people against imperialism and colonialism has been extremely acute, as well as complex, tortuous, and fluctuating, but the general trend has been that the Asian-African people have moved from victory to greater victory, and imperialism and colonialism have moved from failure to greater failure. In the past five years, the armed aggression launched by the United States, Britain, and France against the Middle East, the military provocations by the United States in the Taiwan Strait, and the interference and subversion activities carried out by the United States in Indonesia, Cambodia, and other countries have seriously threatened world peace and the security and independence of these countries, but one after another, they have suffered serious setbacks and shameful failures. The victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the Faisal dynasty powerfully struck at the US imperialist aggression plan in the Middle East, paralyzed the Baghdad Pact, and declared the bankruptcy of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has held fifteen massive national unified actions. Particular emphasis should be placed on the vigorous development of the African national independence movement. The "Dark Continent" is shining brightly, attracting the attention of the world. The national liberation war of the heroic Algerian people is advancing victoriously. The path adhered to by the Algerian people and their heroic and unyielding spirit have extremely significant implications for the development of the African national independence movement. The continuous struggle of the Congolese people shattered the colonialists' dream of a "stable oasis" and forced the Belgian colonialists to agree to the independence of the Congo. From Central Africa and West Africa to East Africa, flames of struggle for independence and freedom have been ignited everywhere. Large-scale mass armed resistance has occurred in countries such as Cameroon, Nyasaland, Ruanda-Urundi, and Uganda. Kenya, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, and even Angola and Mozambique have been swept into the torrent of the struggle for independence and freedom. The struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination is even more intense. The massiveness, rapid development, continuity, and tenacity of the African national independence movement are unprecedented in African history. Under this situation, six newly emerging African independent countries have arisen one after another, and this year Nigeria, Congo, Togo, Somaliland, the Mali Federation, and Madagascar will also achieve independence, and two-thirds of Africa's population will break free from colonial shackles. Now, the storm of the movement for national independence and maintenance of national independence has also blown to the United States' "backyard" of Latin America. All these are new and significant changes that have occurred in the short five years since the Bandung Conference. Five years is just a blink of an eye compared to the long years of suffering experienced by the Asian-African people. However, once the Asian-African people awaken, the latent and limitless vitality, like a volcanic eruption, will overturn the rule of imperialism and colonialism and open up the path towards independence, freedom, and prosperity.
    Another historically significant contribution of the Bandung Conference was the advocacy of the ten principles of peaceful coexistence, which were a development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma in 1954. These reflected the ardent hope of the Asian-African countries and people who had already gained independence to live together in peace in a peaceful international environment, to respect each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, to refrain from aggression against each other, to refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, and to develop economic and cultural exchanges with each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, seeking the common development of national economies and national cultures. This is because the Asian-African people have shared historical experiences; they have all been subjected to aggression and oppression by imperialism and colonialism. They are firmly opposed to aggression and oppression by others and are absolutely unwilling to aggress and oppress others. At the same time, due to the result of imperialist and colonialist aggression, some historical problems have been left between Asian-African countries. In particular, due to the consistent adoption of policies of sowing discord and creating national disputes by imperialism and colonialism to achieve the purpose of divide and rule, there are disputes of one kind or another between Asian-African countries. For the common interests of the Asian-African people, it is also necessary to rationally resolve these disputes in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence. For these reasons, the principles of peaceful co-existence, which were first initiated by China, India, and Burma and developed by the Bandung Conference, have great vitality. Over the past five years, the peaceful, friendly, and cooperative relations between Asian-African countries have greatly increased. The Bandung Conference's principles of peaceful coexistence have become recognized by Asian-African countries and even other peace-loving countries around the world as the guiding principles for international relations.
    China is one of the participating countries in the Bandung Conference and has always actively supported the just struggle of the Asian-African people against imperialism and colonialism, and has always faithfully abided by and implemented the Five Principles and the Ten Principles, sparing no effort to promote friendly and cooperative relations with the governments and people of Asian-African countries.
    Over the past five years, our people have given heartfelt sympathy and active support to the Egyptian people's struggle against the Anglo-French invading forces, to the struggle against the invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British troops, to the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people, to the Indonesian people's struggle against the US-backed rebellion, to the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, to the Cambodian people's struggle against US subversion activities, to the Algerian people's war of resistance against France, and to the struggle of the people in Central Africa, West Africa, East Africa, and South Africa against colonial rule and racial discrimination. Our people regard the just struggles of the people in these countries and regions as our own struggles, their victories as our own victories, and rejoice in every victorious progress of these struggles. At the same time, over the past five years, our country has further developed friendly relations with Asian-African countries and continuously strengthened economic and cultural exchanges with these countries. Now our country has established diplomatic relations with fifteen Asian-African countries, and has established trade and economic ties with fifty-four Asian-African countries and regions. In 1959, our country's import and export trade volume with Asian-African countries increased by 1.4 times compared to 1954. Our country has also established cultural ties and friendly exchanges with sixty-eight Asian-African countries and regions. Regarding some historical problems existing between our country and its friendly neighbors, we have always advocated and actively strived to rationally resolve them through friendly consultation in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence. Recently, our country has signed agreements with Burma and Nepal on border issues, and concluded a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with Burma, providing a good example for the peaceful settlement of all disputes between Asian countries, which has been warmly supported and praised by the people of Burma, Nepal, and other Asian-African countries, as well as world public opinion. Similarly, China and Indonesia have signed a treaty on the issue of dual nationality and exchanged instruments of ratification of this treaty, making a good start for a comprehensive and reasonable solution to the issue of overseas Chinese. China has also consistently advocated friendly consultations based on the Five Principles to seek a reasonable solution to the disputes existing between China and India. Our Premier Zhou Enlai has now begun a visit to Burma, India, and Nepal. We believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's trip will have positive results and promote the development of the traditional friendship between our country and its friendly neighbors such as Burma, India, and Nepal.
    The development of the Asian-African people's struggle for and maintenance of national independence and the strengthening of friendly unity between Asian-African countries and people are conducive to safeguarding the cause of world peace and unfavorable to the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States. Therefore, the international reactionaries headed by US imperialism have always been hostile to the Bandung spirit, hostile to Asian-African unity, and have tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage it. They first aimed their spearhead at the Five Principles and the Ten Principles, at the policy of peace and neutrality of Asian-African national independent countries, and at the peaceful diplomatic policies of socialist countries. Former US Secretary of State Dulles once openly cursed the Five Principles as "cunning words" and attacked peace and neutral countries that support the Five Principles as "immoral." In recent years, the United States has intensified its efforts to incite a vicious anti-China wave, spreading lies such as "China's expansion and aggression," attacking "neutralism is stupid," and insisting that the Five Principles are "dead." In coordinating and supporting the aggressive actions and provocative activities of US imperialism, the Yugoslav revisionists have been playing a particularly shameful role. They flaunt "active coexistence" and "non-alignment," attempting to confuse its policy of selling out to imperialism with the policies of peaceful coexistence and non-alignment pursued by Asian-African countries. However, the Yugoslav revisionists have not only failed to condemn the imperialists' acts of aggression and interference but have also tried every means to defend the imperialists' policies of aggression and war, which further exposes that the Yugoslav revisionists are selling out the goods of opposing socialist countries and surrendering to imperialism in the name of false "active coexistence" and "non-alignment." The US imperialism and Yugoslav revisionists, blinded by greed, believe that they can shake the deep foundation of the Bandung spirit, provoke relations between Asian-African countries, and alienate the unity and friendship between China and Asian-African countries by blowing a gust of evil wind. However, they miscalculated. The friendship between the Asian-African people cannot be provoked, the unity of the Asian-African people cannot be sabotaged, and the Bandung spirit has not only not died but has been carried forward. Recently, the new development of friendly relations between China and Burma and between China and Nepal has given a heavy blow to the provocateurs. China and Burma, and China and Nepal, similarly have border issues, but they can be resolved through friendly consultations, and China is also willing to fix mutual friendly relations in the form of a peace and friendship treaty, so where is the basis for the so-called "China's expansion and aggression"? From the agreements on border issues between China and Burma and between China and Nepal, and from the treaty of friendship and non-aggression between China and Burma, what "stupid" shadow can be found? Isn't this the best proof that the Five Principles have unlimited vitality? As the Nepalese "Nepal News" pointed out, the Sino-Nepalese Joint Communiqué "vividly proves that despite different social systems, peaceful coexistence is possible, and friendly relations between neighboring countries can be maintained."
    Objective facts prove with irrefutable force that it is not others, but imperialism, especially US imperialism, that is the deadly enemy of the independence and freedom of the Asian-African people and the deadly enemy of the Bandung spirit. The Bandung spirit is the spirit of unity and cooperation of the Asian-African people against imperialism and colonialism, and it is the spirit of unity and cooperation of the Asian-African people for the struggle for and maintenance of world peace and national independence. However, US imperialism is the most ferocious colonialist in the world and the most dangerous enemy of world peace. What US imperialism pursues is to dominate the world and place the people of all countries under its enslavement and exploitation. In order to realize this ambition, US imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, deploying military encirclements against socialist countries, and preparing to launch criminal wars of aggression. At the same time, it is waving the banner of "anti-communism" and massively infiltrating many national independent countries and colonies and semi-colonies, attempting to first place these countries and regions under US control. The US policy of aggression and war seriously threatens the independence and freedom of the Asian-African people and the peace of the Asian-African region and the world. All this is completely contrary to the Bandung spirit.
    Imperialism and colonialism will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The people of Asian-African countries still face serious tasks of fighting for and maintaining national independence and world peace. Now, old colonialist countries such as Britain, France, and Belgium, in addition to implementing armed suppression, are making certain concessions in form to maintain their colonial interests under the irresistible situation of the African national independence movement. New colonialists of the United States are taking advantage of the collapse of the original colonial system in Asia and Africa, seizing the opportunity to massively infiltrate, expanding their power in Asia and Africa through military and economic "aid," political cooptation, and cultural aggression, while squeezing out the power of old colonialists, attempting to replace them. According to the huge plan announced by US Assistant Secretary of State Satterthwaite, the United States will greatly increase "special aid" and military "aid" to North Africa for "special political and military interests," and intensify its infiltration into East Africa. On the other hand, it will take "creative new methods" to "coordinate the surging of nationalism with the orderly transition from the past to the future." This is an attempt to lead the African national independence movement to accept new enslavement under US control and plunder, so that the African people cannot get rid of colonial shackles or re-lose independence and freedom, and lose the prospect of independent development. In the Asian region, US imperialism is intensifying its infiltration, interference, subversion, and war preparations.
    It should be particularly pointed out that under the vigorous support of the United States, the forces of Japanese militarism have been revived. This only imperialist country in Asia, which once launched a large-scale invasion of the Far East, is now willing to serve as an instrument of US aggression, concluding a new US-Japan military alliance, openly antagonizing China, the Soviet Union, and the Asian people, and has once again become a new source of war in Asia. The Japanese monopoly capital group represented by Nobusuke Kishi openly said: "We are not willing to be in a privileged position in Southeast Asian countries as we are today." This is exactly the same as the Japanese militarist forces shouting "The South Seas are Japan's lifeline" before invading Southeast Asia before the war. This requires the Asian-African people to increase their vigilance, continuously strengthen friendly unity, and resolutely struggle.
    In the five years since the convening of the Bandung Conference, the Asian-African people's struggle for peace, independence, freedom, and friendly cooperation has made new and significant progress and made significant contributions to the cause of world peace and human progress. Although the struggle ahead is still arduous, and there will be some twists and turns and countercurrents, the humiliating old era in which the Asian-African people were oppressed, enslaved, and manipulated is gone forever; the new era in which the Asian-African people stand tall, get rid of poverty and backwardness, and participate in deciding the fate of world politics has begun! As long as we strengthen unity, do not be provoked, do not have illusions, and struggle resolutely, the historical trend of the Asian-African people's struggle for and maintenance of peace, independence, and friendly unity cannot be stopped by any force!

    亚非人民前途无量
    ——纪念万隆会议五周年
    中国人民同亚非人民一道，热烈纪念万隆会议的五周年。五年前，二十九个亚非国家第一次举行了没有殖民国家参加的会议，庄严地发出了占世界人口一半以上的亚非人民共同声讨帝国主义和殖民主义的檄文，倡导了和平共处的十项原则。这是曾经遭受帝国主义殖民主义的残酷压迫和剥削的亚非人民空前觉醒的重大标志，是亚非人民争取和平、独立、自由和友好合作的伟大斗争深入发展的里程碑。五年来，在东风压倒西风的形势下，在万隆精神的鼓舞和推动下，亚非地区民族独立运动有了很大的发展，亚非各国和人民间的团结合作和友好联系不断地加强和扩大，帝国主义殖民体系发生了进一步的瓦解。万隆会议的历史意义日益显著，万隆精神的生命力日益充沛。回顾五年来亚非人民的不平凡的历程，瞩望亚非人民面前的大好形势，令人兴奋地感到亚非人民解放事业的前景，无可限量。
    万隆会议发出的反对帝国主义殖民主义的呼声，五年来响彻亚非的广大地区。五年来，亚非人民同帝国主义殖民主义的斗争是极其尖锐的，也是错综复杂、曲折起伏的，但总的趋势是亚非人民从胜利走向更大的胜利，帝国主义和殖民主义从失败走向更大的失败。在过去五年中，美英法连续对中东发动的武装侵略，美国在台湾海峡的军事挑衅，以及美国对印度尼西亚、柬埔寨和其他国家进行的干涉和颠复活动，曾经严重地威胁着世界和平和这些国家的安全和独立，但结果一个接着一个地遭到了严重的挫折和可耻的失败。伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝的胜利，有力地打击了美帝国主义在中东的侵略计划，瘫痪了巴格达条约，并使
  “艾森豪威尔主义”宣告破产。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，反对岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争，已经举行了十五次声势浩大的全国统一行动。特别应当强调的是非洲民族独立运动的猛烈发展，“黑暗大陆”大放光芒，正吸引着全世界的注意力。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，正在胜利前进。阿尔及利亚人民坚持的道路以及他们英勇不屈的精神，对于非洲民族独立运动的发展，具有极重大的意义。刚果人民坚持不息的斗争，粉碎了殖民主义者的“安定的绿洲”的迷梦，迫使比利时殖民者同意刚果独立。从中非、西非到东非，到处燃起了争取独立自由的熊熊火焰。喀麦隆、尼亚萨兰、卢安达—乌隆迪、乌干达等国都发生了大规模的群众性的武装反抗。怯尼亚、坦噶尼喀、桑给巴尔，以至安哥拉和莫三鼻给都卷进了争取独立自由的洪流。南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争更是如火如荼。非洲民族独立运动的群众性之广泛、发展之迅速、持续和坚韧性，都是非洲历史上空前未有的。在这形势下，六个新兴的非洲独立国家接连而起，今年还将有尼日利亚、刚果、多哥、索马里兰、马里联邦和马达加斯加取得独立，非洲将有三分之二的人口挣脱殖民枷锁。现在，争取和维护民族独立运动的风暴，也吹到了美国的“后院”拉丁美洲。所有这些，都是万隆会议以来短短五年内发生的新的巨大变化。五年，这对于亚非人民所经历的漫长的苦难岁月来说，不过是一瞬间，然而，亚非人民一旦觉醒，潜藏的无限活力就像火山爆发一样，炸翻帝国主义殖民主义的统治，开拓走向独立、自由、繁荣的大道。
    万隆会议的另一个有历史意义的贡献，就是倡导了和平共处的十项原则，这十项原则是中国和印度、缅甸1954年共同倡导的和平共处五项原则的发展。这反映了已经获得了独立的亚非国家和人民，热烈希望能够在和平的国际环境中友好相处，互相尊重领土和主权完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，并在平等互利的基础上发展彼此之间的经济往来和文化往来，求得民族经济和民族文化的共同发展。这是因为亚非人民有着共同的历史遭遇，他们都曾经受到帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫。他们坚决反对别人侵略和压迫，也绝不愿意侵略和压迫别人。同时，亚非各国之间，由于帝国主义和殖民主义侵略的结果，都遗留一些历史性的问题。特别是由于帝国主义和殖民主义一贯采取挑拨离间、制造民族纠纷、以达到分而治之的政策，亚非各国之间存在着这样或那样的争端。为了亚非人民的共同利益，也需要本着和平共处的原则来合理解决这些争端。由于这些原故，中国和印度、缅甸首倡的、而为万隆会议发展了的和平共处原则，具有伟大的生命力。五年以来，亚非各国之间的和平友好与合作关系，有了很大的增进。万隆会议的和平共处原则，已经成为亚非国家以至全世界其他爱好和平国家公认的指导国际关系的准则。
    中国是万隆会议的参加国之一，一贯积极地支持亚非各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的正义斗争，一贯忠实地遵守和执行五项原则和十项原则，不遗余力地促进同亚非国家政府和人民的友好合作关系。
    我国人民五年来对于埃及人民抗击英法侵略军队的斗争，对于反对美英军队侵犯黎巴嫩和约旦的斗争，对于伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，对于印度尼西亚人民反对美国支持的叛乱的斗争，对于日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争，对于柬埔寨人民反对美国颠复活动的斗争，对于阿尔及利亚人民的抗法战争，以及对于中非、西非、东非和南非等地人民反对殖民统治和种族歧视的斗争，都给以衷心的同情和积极的声援。我国人民把这些国家和地区的人民的正义斗争看作是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看作是自己的胜利，为这些斗争的每一个胜利的进展欢欣鼓舞。同时，我国五年来又进一步发展同亚非各国的友好关系，不断加强同这些国家的经济文化交流。现在我国已经同十五个亚非国家建立了外交关系，同五十四个亚非国家和地区建立了贸易和经济联系，1959年我国对亚非国家进出口贸易额比1954年增长了一点四倍。我国还同六十八个亚非国家和地区建立了文化联系和友好往来。我国对于同自己的友好邻邦之间存在着一些历史遗留下来的问题，一贯主张和积极努力根据和平共处原则，通过友好协商，加以合理解决。最近我国同缅甸和尼泊尔签订了关于边界问题的协定，同缅甸缔结了友好和互不侵犯条约，就为和平解决亚洲国家间的一切争端提供了良好的范例，得到了缅甸、尼泊尔和其他亚非国家的人民以及全世界公众舆论的热烈拥护和赞扬。同样的，中国同印度尼西亚之间已经签订了关于双重国籍问题条约并且交换了这个条约的批准书，为全面地合理解决华侨问题作出了良好的开端。中国对于中印之间存在的争端，也一贯主张根据五项原则，进行友好协商，求得合理的解决。我国周恩来总理现已开始前往缅甸、印度、尼泊尔进行访问。我们相信，周恩来总理此行，必将产生积极的效果，促进我国同缅甸、印度、尼泊尔等友好邻邦的传统友谊的发展。
    亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争的发展，亚非国家和人民之间的友好团结的加强，有利于维护世界和平事业，而不利于以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。所以，以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派一直敌视万隆精神、敌视亚非团结，并千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏。它们把矛头首先指向五项原则和十项原则，指向亚非民族独立国家的和平中立政策，指向社会主义国家的和平外交政策。前美国国务卿杜勒斯就曾公开咒诅五项原则是“狡诈的字眼”，并攻击拥护五项原则的和平中立国家“不道德”。近年以来，美国更竭力煽动恶毒的反华浪潮，散布所谓“中国的扩张和侵略”之类的谎言，攻击“中立主义是愚蠢的”，硬说五项原则“死亡了”。在配合和支持美帝国主义的侵略行为和挑拨活动中，南斯拉夫修正主义者一直扮演着一个特殊的可耻的角色。他们标榜“积极共处”、“非集团”，企图把它的向帝国主义卖身投靠的政策同亚非国家奉行的和平共处和不结盟的政策混淆起来。但是，南斯拉夫修正主义者不仅没有谴责帝国主义的侵略和干涉罪行，而且百般替帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策辩护，这就进一步暴露了南斯拉夫修正主义者是假“积极共处”、“非集团”之名，兜售反对社会主义国家、投靠帝国主义的货色。利令智昏的美帝国主义和南斯拉夫修正主义者以为，他们刮一阵邪风，就能摇撼万隆精神的深厚根基，就能挑拨亚非国家之间的关系，就能离间中国同亚非国家的团结和友谊。但是，他们失算了。亚非人民的友谊是挑拨不了的，亚非人民的团结是破坏不了的，万隆精神不但没有死亡而且发扬光大了。最近，中缅、中尼友好关系的新发展，又给了挑拨者以沉重的打击。中缅、中尼之间同样存在着边界问题，却能通过友好协商得到解决，中国还愿意用和平友好条约的形式把相互的友好关系固定下来，那末，所谓“中国的扩张和侵略”的根据在哪里呢？从中缅、中尼关于边界问题的协定中，从中缅友好和互不侵犯条约中，又能找到什么“愚蠢”的影子呢？这不正是五项原则具有无限充沛的活力的最好证明吗？正如尼泊尔“尼泊尔新闻报”指出的，中尼联合公报“生动地证明了，尽管社会制度不同，和平共处是可能的，邻国之间是可以保持友好与和平的。”
    客观事实以无可批驳的力量说明：不是别人，而是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是亚非人民独立自由的死敌、是万隆精神的死敌。万隆精神是亚非人民为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而团结合作的精神，是亚非人民为争取和维护世界和平和民族独立而团结合作的精神。而美帝国主义却是世界上最凶恶的殖民主义者，是世界和平的最危险的敌人。美帝国主义所追求的是称霸全世界，把各国人民都置于它的奴役和剥削之下。为了实现这个野心，美帝国主义正加紧进行扩军备战，布置对社会主义各国的军事包围，准备发动罪恶的侵略战争；与此同时，它又打着“反共”的旗帜，大举向许多民族独立国家和殖民地半殖民地渗入，企图首先把这些国家和地区放在美国的控制之下。美国的侵略政策和战争政策，严重地威胁着亚非各国人民的独立自由和亚非地区和全世界的和平。这一切都是和万隆精神完全对立的。
    帝国主义殖民主义是不会自动退出历史舞台的。亚非各国人民仍然面临着争取和维护民族独立和世界和平的严重任务。现在，英、法、比利时等老牌殖民主义国家，除了实行武力镇压之外，迫于非洲民族独立运动势不可当的形势，正在作出某些形式上的让步，来保持它们的殖民利益。美国新殖民主义者鉴于亚非原有的殖民制度的瓦解，乘机大举渗入，一面以军事经济“援助”、政治笼络和文化侵略等办法，向亚洲和非洲扩张势力，一面排挤老牌殖民主义的势力，企图取而代之。据美国助理国务卿萨脱斯威特宣布的庞大计划，美国一方面为了“特殊的政治上和军事上的利益”，将大大增加对北非的“特别援助”和军事“援助”，并加紧向东非渗透；另一方面将采取“富有创造性的新办法”，“把民族主义的高涨和有条不紊地从过去过渡到未来的方法加以协调”。这就是企图把非洲民族独立运动引向接受美国控制和掠夺的新的奴役中去，使非洲人民不能摆脱殖民主义枷锁或者重新丧失独立自由，丧失独立发展的前途。在亚洲地区，美帝国主义正在加紧进行渗透、干涉、颠复和备战活动。
    这里特别应当指出的是，在美国的大力扶植下，日本军国主义势力已经复活。这个曾经大规模侵略远东的亚洲唯一的帝国主义国家，现在甘心充当美国的侵略工具，缔结了日美新军事同盟，公开与中苏和亚洲人民为敌，重新成为亚洲的新的战争策源地。岸信介所代表的日本垄断资本集团公然说：“我们不甘愿再像今天这样在东南亚各国处于没有特权的地位”。这同战前日本军国主义势力在侵略东南亚前叫嚷“南洋是日本的生命线”一模一样。这就要求亚非人民加倍地提高警惕，不断加强友好团结，坚决进行斗争。
    万隆会议召开的五年来，亚非人民争取和平、独立、自由和友好合作的斗争，取得了新的重大的进展，对世界和平和人类进步事业作了重大的贡献。虽然，今后的斗争仍然是艰巨的，会出现一些曲折和逆流，但是，亚非人民被压迫、被奴役、被摆布的屈辱的旧时代，已经一去不复返了；亚非人民顶天立地、摆脱贫穷落后、参加决定世界政治命运的新纪元，已经开始了！只要加强团结，不受挑拨，不存幻想，坚决斗争，亚非人民争取和维护和平、独立、友好团结的历史潮流是任何力量也阻挡不住的！
