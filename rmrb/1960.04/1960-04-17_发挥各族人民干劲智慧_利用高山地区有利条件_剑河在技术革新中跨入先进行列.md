    Jianhe Advances into the Ranks of the Advanced Through Technological Innovation
    This newspaper reports: Jianhe County is a well-known high mountain area on the Guizhou Plateau. Most of the cultivated land is located on the mountainside, which creates great difficulties for cultivation. After the establishment of the people's communes, thanks to the soaring drive of all ethnic groups, great efforts were made in technological innovation and revolution based on the characteristics of the local natural environment. The appearance of the mountainous area has undergone significant changes, and labor conditions have been significantly improved.
    Entering the territory of Jianhe County, a beautiful and moving scene appears before you. Beside the rivers and streams, wooden water turbines are spinning rapidly, and the rumbling sound of the machines breaks the silence of the mountains and forests. Many steep cliffs and slopes are fitted with chutes and slides. On flat and gentle slopes, wooden rail carts, ox carts, and pack oxen shuttle back and forth. These high-efficiency tools that turn by the river, fly in the sky, and push on the ground have replaced heavy manual labor such as hand-cranking, foot-pedaling, shoulder-carrying, and back-packing.
    Since the technological innovation and revolution movement was launched across the country, the Jianhe County Party Committee has realized from practice that the continuous development of technological innovation and revolution is the way to change the backwardness of mountainous areas. In order to lay a solid ideological foundation, the County Party Committee organized and mobilized cadres and the masses throughout the county to carefully analyze the favorable and unfavorable conditions of the mountainous areas, so that the vast number of cadres and members realized that although high mountains and steep slopes create certain difficulties for technological innovation, the favorable conditions are still the main ones. For example, there are many rivers and cattle in the mountainous areas, so water and animal power can be widely used; high mountains are convenient for building slides, and steep slopes are natural chutes; the mountainous areas are rich in resources, with inexhaustible raw materials; more importantly, the labor intensity in the mountainous areas has always been relatively high, and the masses urgently demand technological innovation to improve labor efficiency. After this analysis and discussion, the confidence of cadres and members increased, and their enthusiasm became even higher. The County Party Committee then proposed to the whole county the slogan of "Making great efforts in technological innovation, asking water and animal power for labor, and striving for one person to be worth five people." All communes, management areas, and production teams have successively established leadership organizations. The county focused its technological innovation efforts on two key areas: the widespread use of water and animal power and the change of backward transportation conditions. Technological innovation activities were carried out among cadres and Party and League members. In January of this year, the number of people participating in technological innovation activities in the county doubled compared with last year. The heroic slogan of the members of all ethnic groups is: "If there is no electricity, use water power; if there are no cars, use cattle to carry; if the tools are not enough, make them ourselves; everyone innovate and plant the red flag." When steel wire slides were lacking iron wire, the members used bamboo strips and yellow rattan vines, which are abundant in the mountainous areas, to weave ropes instead. When repairing wooden rail cart tracks required a large number of iron nails, they were replaced with sharpened hardwood. As of the beginning of February, the county had built a total of 860 water-powered oil presses, mills, planking machines, and grinders, 100,776 steel wire and bamboo cable slides and chutes, and more than 13,000 wooden rail flat cars and ox carts. More than 20,000 head of cattle have participated in transportation, which has increased the efficiency of transporting fertilizer, milling rice, pressing oil, and sawing wood by five to forty times, and has basically eliminated the phenomenon of people carrying on their shoulders and backs.
    Due to the implementation of the policy of adapting to local conditions, the technological innovation and revolution movement in Jianhe County developed rapidly and had immediate results. Tai Gong People's Commune has abundant water sources, so it established 181 water-powered planking machines, water grinders, and water-powered oil presses by the river. This item alone can save 250,000 workdays throughout the year. Many communes have promoted the experience of comprehensive utilization of water power, so that a water turbine can simultaneously drive several oil presses, rice mills, or planking machines. After Shi Dong Commune changed manual bellows to water-powered bellows, it not only saved eleven laborers, but also improved the production and quality of deep plows. More than 90% of the county's cultivated land is terraced slopes, with fields high and villages low. In previous years, fertilizer was transported from bottom to top. Every year, the labor used for transporting fertilizer was almost equal to the total labor used for transplanting rice seedlings, cultivating, and harvesting, and the labor intensity was also high. This year, all communes have taken the method of accumulating fertilizer on the mountains, and moved pig and cattle pens to the mountains, changing the direction of fertilizer transportation, and using slides and chutes to put fertilizer from top to bottom into the fields, which increased the efficiency of fertilizer transportation by more than ten times. This year, Xin Liu Commune will apply more than twice as much manure as last year. If it were transported solely by the members responsible for accumulating fertilizer, it would take 450 days to transport. By using slides and chutes to transport fertilizer, the number of people remains unchanged, and it can all be transported to the fields in more than a month. In the technological innovation and revolution movement, the people of all ethnic groups carried forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. If they didn't know how to do something, they learned, and if they learned, they did it. Yang Changyu, a "clever carpenter" from Tai Gong Commune, did not lose heart after many failures in creating a water-powered planking machine, and finally made a new machine that increased the efficiency by twenty times compared with manual operation. In the innovation process, all localities also adopted the method of "inserting needles in the seams," and while grasping large projects, they did not neglect small projects. At present, all of the county's more than 900 canteens have installed local tap water based on the superior conditions of being close to mountains and water. Some canteens have also changed the vegetable cutting machine to be driven by water power, or laid wooden rail cart tracks in the canteen, and used wooden rail carts to deliver dishes and meals to the tables. In addition to the adoption of innovation measures such as one stove with multiple pots, the number of canteen service personnel has been reduced by nearly half, and it can also ensure that members eat well, eat enough, and eat on time.
    Making great efforts in technological innovation and revolution has not only changed the appearance of production in mountainous areas, but also solved the difficulty of labor shortage. Recently, the county has successively transferred thousands of laborers to participate in industrial construction, and rural laborers generally feel insufficient. According to a key survey of the Jiaomi Management Area of ​​Taiyong Commune, 210,000 workdays are needed for agriculture throughout the year, while the members participating in agricultural production can only do 150,000 workdays, a difference of about 29%. After widely carrying out the technological innovation and revolution movement, the difficulty of labor shortage has been basically solved. The Jiaomi Management Area made extensive use of water and animal power, and built a large number of ox carts, slides, and chutes, not only making the labor force sufficient, but also having a surplus.
    The technological innovation and revolution movement in Jianhe County has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. When many members first saw the fertilizer baskets flying straight down the slides and the water turbines driving various local machines spinning rapidly, they happily clapped their hands and shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" They said that technological innovation has liberated their shoulders and feet.

    发挥各族人民干劲智慧　利用高山地区有利条件
    剑河在技术革新中跨入先进行列
    本报讯　剑河县是贵州高原上著名的高山地区。耕地多在半山腰，造成耕作上的极大困难。人民公社成立后，由于各族人民发挥了冲天的干劲，根据当地自然环境的特点，大搞技术革新和技术革命，山区的面貌已经发生了重大的变化，劳动条件得到了显著的改善。
    走入剑河县境，面前就呈现一片美丽动人的景象。在河边水旁，木质水轮机飞速地转动，机器的隆隆声冲破了山林的寂静，许多峭壁陡坡上架起梭槽，修成滑道。在平地和缓坡上，木轨车、牛马车和驮牛往来如梭。这些河边转、天上飞、地下推的高工效工具，代替了手摇脚踩、肩挑背驮等笨重体力劳动。
    自从技术革新和技术革命运动在全国展开以后，中共剑河县委从实践中认识到，技术革新与技术革命的不断发展，是改变山区的落后面貌的道路。为了打好思想基础，县委组织发动全县干部和广大群众，细致分析山区的有利条件和不利条件，使广大干部和社员认识到，山高坡陡虽然给技术革新造成一定困难，但是有利条件仍然是主要的。如山区河流多、耕牛多，可以广泛应用水力和畜力；山高便于架设滑道，坡陡是自然的梭槽；山区资源丰富，有取之不尽、用之不竭的原料；更重要的是山区劳动强度一向较高，群众迫切要求实行技术革新，以提高劳动效率。经过这次分析讨论，干部和社员的信心足了，干劲更高了。县委即向全县提出“大搞技术革新，向水力、畜力要劳力，争取一人顶五人”的号召。各公社、管理区和生产队，都先后建立了领导组织。全县将技术革新的矛头指向广泛利用水力、畜力和改变运输落后状况两个重点。在干部和党团员中开展了技术革新活动。今年1月，全县参加技术革新活动的人数，较去年增加两倍。各族社员的豪迈口号是：“没有电力用水力，没有汽车用牛驮，工具不足自己造，人人革新插红旗”。搞钢丝滑道缺少铁丝，社员们就用山区盛产的竹篾和黄线藤编成索子代替；修木轨车道要大量的铁钉，就用硬木削尖了代替。截至2月上旬为止，全县已建成水力带动的油榨、碾子、解板机、?子共八百六十部，钢丝、竹缆滑道和梭槽十万零七百七十六条，木轨平车、牛马车一万三千多部，并有二万多头耕牛先后参加了驮运。使运肥、碾米、榨油和解木板等工效分别提高五倍到四十倍，基本上消灭了人挑背驮的现象。
    由于贯彻执行了因地制宜的方针，剑河县的技术革新和技术革命运动迅速发展，立竿见影。台拱人民公社水源充足，就在河边建立了水力解板机、水?、水力油榨一百八十一部，只此一项，全年即可节约二十五万个劳动日。许多公社推广了综合利用水力的经验，使一架水轮机同时带动几部榨油、碾米或解板机具。施洞公社改人拉风箱为水力带动风箱后，不仅节约了十一个劳动力，而且提高了深耕犁的产量和质量。全县90％以上的耕地是梯田坡地，田高村寨矮，往年运肥都是从下往上挑，每年运肥用工几乎等于插秧、中耕和收割用工总和，劳动强度也大。今年，各公社都采取了上山积肥办法，并将猪牛圈搬上山，改变运肥方向，用滑道、梭槽自上而下把肥料放到田间，使运肥效率提高十几倍。新柳公社今年施粪肥将比去年增加一倍以上，如果单由负责积肥的社员挑运，要运四百五十天；利用滑道和梭槽运肥，人数不变，一个多月即可全部运到田间。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，各族人民发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干精神，不会就学，学会就做。台拱公社“巧木匠”杨昌禹在创造水力解板机过程中，虽多次失败仍不灰心，终于制成工效比手工操作提高二十倍的新机具。革新中各地还采取“见缝插针”的方法，在抓住大的项目的同时，也没有忽略小的项目。目前全县九百多个食堂都根据靠山近水的优越条件，安装上土自来水。有的食堂切菜机也改用水力带动，或者在食堂内铺上木轨车道，用木轨车送菜饭到饭桌。加上采用了一灶多锅等革新措施，食堂服务人员减少将近一半，还能保证社员吃得好、吃得饱、吃得及时。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，既改变了山区的生产面貌，又解决了劳动力紧张的困难。最近这个县接连上调了几千个劳动力参加工业建设，农村劳动力普遍感到不足。据太雍公社交密管理区重点调查，全年农业上需要二十一万个劳动日，而参加农业生产的社员只能作十五万个劳动日，相差29％左右。广泛开展技术革新和技术革命运动后，劳力紧张的困难基本上得到解决。交密管理区多方面利用水力、畜力，大造牛马车、滑道和梭槽后，劳动力不仅够用，而且还有节余。
    剑河县的技术革新和技术革命运动已经深入人心。许多社员初次看到肥料筐顺滑道直飞而下和水轮机带动各种土机械急速转动时，高兴得拍起手来高呼“共产党万岁！”说技术革新解放了肩膀和脚板。
