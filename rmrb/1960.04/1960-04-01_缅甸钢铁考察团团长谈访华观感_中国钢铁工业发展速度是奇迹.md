Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 30th. U Khin Maung Gyi, head of the Burmese Steel Delegation, who recently visited China, told Xinhua reporters here today that "The Chinese government and people highly value the friendship between our two countries. In the factories we visited, we were not only warmly received, but also provided with technical information without reservation, which gave us a lot of valuable experience." He thanked the Chinese government and people for the warm reception given to the delegation during its visit to China.

U Khin Maung Gyi expressed the hope that China and Burma could frequently send delegations to visit each other in the future to promote friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries.

He said that what impressed him most during his visit to China was the selfless efforts of the Chinese workers.

He said that the factories he visited were engaged in a socialist construction competition. They completed the monthly targets ahead of schedule and exceeded them.

U Khin Maung Gyi is also the chairman of the management committee of the Burma State-owned Steel Rolling Mill. He emphasized that the speed of development of China's steel industry in the past ten years is a miracle. Steel production in 1949 was only 150,000 tons, but by 1959 it had risen to 13.35 million tons. This can be said to be a great achievement.

    缅甸钢铁考察团团长谈访华观感
    中国钢铁工业发展速度是奇迹
    新华社仰光30日电　最近刚访问过中国的缅甸钢铁考察团团长吴庆貌季今天在这里接见新华社记者时说，“中国政府和人民非常珍视我们两国的友谊。在我们访问的工厂里，我们不但受到热情招待，并且还毫无保留地向我们提供技术资料，使我们得到许多宝贵的经验。”他感谢中国政府和人民在考察团访华期间所给予的热烈接待。
    吴庆貌季表示希望，中缅两国将来能经常互派代表团进行访问，以促进两国的友谊和相互了解。
    他说，他在访华期间印象最深的是中国工人们的无私的努力。
    他说，他所访问的工厂正在进行社会主义建设的竞赛。它们提前超额完成月指标。
    吴庆貌季也是缅甸国营轧钢厂管理委员会主任。他强调说，过去十年的中国钢铁工业的发展速度是奇迹。1949年的钢产量只有十五万吨，到1959年已经上升到一千三百三十五万吨。这可以说是莫大的成就。
