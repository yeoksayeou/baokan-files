    Berlin International Historians Conference
    Discusses "German Imperialism and the Second World War"

    According to the Soviet "Kommunist" magazine, 1960, issue No. 3, the Soviet and German Democratic Republic Historians Committee held a scientific conference in Berlin from December 14 to 19, 1959, on the topic of "German Imperialism and the Second World War." The conference discussed many important issues concerning German imperialism and the Second World War: First, the question of the nature of the Second World War. Soviet historians believe that the Second World War was the result of the intensification of imperialist contradictions. It initially had the nature of an imperialist war but later transformed into a just war of anti-fascist liberation. The Soviet Union's entry into the war played an important role in completing the transformation of the war's nature. This conclusion was agreed upon by progressive historians abroad. Second, the question of the regularity and historical inevitability of the failure of German imperialism in the two World Wars. Historians believe that the disastrous failure of German imperialism in the two World Wars was entirely in accordance with objective laws. The failure of German imperialism reflects the inevitable demise of the capitalist system and the inevitable victory of socialism over capitalism. Third, the Soviet Union's entry into the war and its victory conformed to the fundamental law that peaceful forces will triumph over fascism. The victory over fascist Germany and its allies in the Second World War was due to the joint efforts of all nations in the anti-fascist alliance. However, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in achieving victory. Fourth, the question of the role of the masses in the war was also discussed. This conference, with its conclusions and analysis of historical facts, demonstrated the inevitability of the demise of imperialist aggressor forces, the regularity of the victory of democratic and socialist forces, and struck a blow against bourgeois historical fabricators.

    柏林国际历史学家会议
    讨论“德国帝国主义和第二次世界大战”问题
    据苏联“共产党人”杂志1960年第三期报道，苏联和德意志民主共和国历史学家委员会于1959年12月14日到19日就“德国帝国主义和第二次世界大战”问题在柏林举行了科学会议。会上讨论了德国帝国主义和第二次世界大战的许多重要问题：第一，关于第二次世界大战性质的问题。苏联历史学家认为，第二次世界大战是帝国主义矛盾尖锐化的结果，它在起初带有帝国主义战争的性质，可是后来转化成为反法西斯的解放的正义战争。苏联加入战争，对完成战争性质的转化起了重要的作用。这个结论，得到国外进步历史学家的同意。第二，德国帝国主义在两次世界大战中失败的规律性和历史必然性问题。历史学家们认为，德国帝国主义在两次世界大战中遭到惨重的失败是完全合乎规律的。从德国帝国主义的失败中反映出资本主义体系必然灭亡，社会主义必然战胜资本主义的规律。第三，苏联加入战争并取得胜利，是合乎和平力量战胜法西斯主义的基本规律的。在第二次世界大战中能够战胜法西斯德国及其同盟国家，是由于反法西斯同盟各民族的共同努力。但是，苏联在取得胜利中起着决定性的作用。第四，关于人民群众在战争中的作用问题也作了讨论。这次会议用自己的结论和对历史事实的分析，说明了帝国主义侵略势力灭亡的必然性，说明了民主和社会主义力量胜利的规律性，打击了资产阶级的历史捏造者。
