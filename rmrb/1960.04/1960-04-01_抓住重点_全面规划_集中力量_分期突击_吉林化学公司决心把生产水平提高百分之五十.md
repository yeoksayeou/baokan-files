    Jilin Chemical Company Determined to Raise Production Level by Fifty Percent

    (Our Dispatch) The broad masses of workers and staff of Jilin Chemical Industrial Company in Jilin Province are determined to raise the existing production level by another 40% to 50% this year; and to climb the peaks of technology and march towards cutting-edge science.

    After winning the brilliant achievement of a comprehensive leap forward in production in 1959, Jilin Chemical Industrial Company launched a movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, achieving continuous leaps forward in production in the first two months of this year. In order to guide this mass technical revolution movement towards sustained leap forward and progress towards higher goals, the company's Party committee, based on the "development as the main focus, combined with improvement" policy put forward by the company's first Party Congress, fully mobilized the masses to formulate a comprehensive plan for technical innovation and technical revolution for the entire company for the whole year.

    In this plan, different requirements were put forward for different departments, and all forces were concentrated on some main directions. For example, for production auxiliary departments, especially transportation loading and unloading, raw material crushing, finished product packaging and warehousing departments, the direction was to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization, and eliminate all heavy manual labor. For departments with a high degree of mechanization, the direction of development was to achieve continuous operation and automation, and to realize the overall automation of work sections, workshops, single products, and even the entire factory as soon as possible. For scientific research departments, it was proposed to research and trial-produce new products that are high, large, precise, and cutting-edge, and to march towards cutting-edge technology. For basic construction departments, it was required to gradually realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in the entire construction process, and to carry out rapid construction on a large scale.

    Based on the above directions, they put forward the battle slogans of "Four Transformations," "Six News," "Three Nos," "One Cutting-Edge," "Scientific Research Forming a Network," "Education Forming a System," one person doing the work of two, and doubling the output value three times, as the main indicators of the technical revolution. The so-called "Four Transformations" means taking the realization of mechanization, continuous operation, automation, and industrialization of basic construction as the center of the technical revolution. Within this year, the company's mechanization level should be increased from the current 65% to 90%, and labor productivity should be increased by 35% to 37% compared with last year. One hundred and forty-eight mechanization and semi-mechanization projects, thirty-one continuous operation and semi-continuous operation projects, eighty automation and semi-automation projects, and four industrialization of basic construction construction projects should be realized within the company. The "Six News" mainly refers to cultivating and promoting a large number of engineering and technical personnel from workers and revolutionary intellectuals who are both red and expert this year to strengthen the engineering and technical team of the working class; adopting new technologies, new processes, and new equipment to strengthen production, improve efficiency, and make the most finished products with the least raw materials; adopting new materials to overcome material difficulties and meet the needs of great development, and mass-producing new products, etc. The "Three Nos" are to comprehensively utilize waste gas, waste water, and waste residue, so that all of them become useful and non-toxic things. "One Cutting-Edge" is to establish lofty ambitions, climb the peaks of science, and strive to double the number of cutting-edge chemical projects this year based on the national plan. "Scientific Research Forming a Network" means that in scientific research, the principle of "one main, two secondary, and three combinations" of production, research, and education is implemented, and a research and experimental network for the entire company is formed with the research institute as the center, turning experimental and research work into a mass movement. A research network of thousands of groups and tens of thousands of people will be built within the company this year, researching one hundred and eighty-four projects. "Education Forming a System" means combining technical revolution with a vigorous cultural revolution, establishing a complete education system within the company this year, so as to cultivate everyone in the company into laborers with high political consciousness and high scientific and technological culture.

    In order to ensure the realization of the annual plan for technical innovation and technical revolution, the company also put forward the main measures to realize the plan, pointing out that the key to carrying out the technical revolution movement well lies in strengthening ideological leadership, constantly analyzing the characteristics of different stages of the technical revolution, talking a lot about the situation, creating a lot of momentum, encouraging great enthusiasm, everyone contributing ideas, and everyone taking action. At the same time, in the movement, it is necessary to have both long-term plans and short-term arrangements, shorten the battle lines, concentrate forces, break through the current key to production, organize the "great battle" of technical innovation and technical revolution, and realize the plan in batches and phases.

    At present, in the first stage, the company's employees have put forward 37,420 innovation proposals, realized 6,685 of them, saved 1,059 people, and increased production capacity by a value of 72 million yuan calculated by output value.

    抓住重点　全面规划  集中力量　分期突击
    吉林化学公司决心把生产水平提高百分之五十
    本报讯　吉林省吉林化学工业公司广大职工，决心在今年内把现有生产水平再提高40％到50％；并要攀登技术高峰，向尖端科学进军。
    吉林化学工业公司在夺得了1959年生产全面跃进的辉煌成就之后，又开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，夺得了今年头两个月生产的连续跃进。公司党委为了把这个群众性的技术革命运动引向持续跃进和朝着更高的目标前进，根据公司首届党员代表大会决议提出的“发展为主，结合提高”的方针，充分发动群众，制定了全公司全年技术革新和技术革命的全面规划。
    在这个规划中，对于不同部门提出了不同的要求，把各方面的力量都集中到一些主要方向上去。例如，对于生产辅助部门，特别是运输装卸、原料破碎、成品包装和入库等部门，提出实现机械化、半机械化，消除一切笨重体力劳动为方向。对于机械化程度较高的部门，提出以实现连续化、自动化为发展方向，尽快地实现工段、车间、单项产品，一直到整个工厂的全盘自动化为目标。对于科学研究部门，则提出要研究试制生产高、大、精、尖的新产品，向尖端技术进军。对于基本建设部门，要求在全部施工过程中逐步实现机械化、半机械化，大搞快速施工。
    根据以上的方向，他们提出了“四化”、“六新”、“三无”、“一尖”，“科研成网”、“教育成系”，一人顶二人，产值翻三番等战斗口号，作为技术革命的主要指标。所谓“四化”，就是以实现机械化、连续化、自动化及基本建设工厂化为技术革命的中心，在今年内，要使全公司机械化程度由现有的65％提高到90％，劳动生产效率比去年提高35％到37％，在全公司范围内实现机械化、半机械化一百四十八项，连续化、半连续化三十一项，自动化、半自动化八十项，基本建设施工工厂化四项。“六新”主要是在今年内大量培养提拔一批工人出身的工程技术人员与又红又专的革命知识分子，壮大工人阶级的工程技术队伍；采用新工艺，新流程、新设备，以加强生产，提高效率，用最少的原料，做出最多的成品；采用新材料，突破材料难关，适应大发展的需要，大量生产新产品等等。“三无”是综合利用废气、废水、废渣，使之全部变为有用，无毒的东西。“一尖”是树立雄心大志，攀登科学高峰，力争化学尖端项目在今年国家计划的基础上翻一番。“科研成网”就是在科学研究方面，贯彻生产、研究、教育“一主二从三结合”的方针，以研究院为中心，形成全公司的研究试验网，把试验、研究工作变为群众性的运动，在今年内在全公司范围内建成千组万人的研究网，研究一百八十四个项目。“教育成系”是结合技术革命大闹文化革命，今年内在全公司建立一个完整的教育体系，以便把全公司每个人都培养成具有高度政治觉悟又有高度的科学技术文化的劳动者。
    为了保证全年技术革新和技术革命的规划得以实现，这个公司还提出实现规划的主要措施，指出技术革命运动开展得好的关键在于加强思想领导，不断分析技术革命不同阶段的特点，大讲形势，大造声势，大鼓干劲，人人献计，个个动手。同时，在运动中要做到既有长计划，又有短安排，缩短战线，集中力量，突破当前生产关键，组织技术革新和技术革命的“大会战”，分批分期实现计划。
    目前，在第一阶段中，全公司职工已提出了三万七千四百二十件革新建议，实现了六千六百八十五件，节省一千零五十九人，提高生产能力按产值计算价值七千二百万元。
