Xinhua News Agency, 6th. New York dispatch: The Communist Party of the United States has issued another statement regarding the persecution of Henry Winston, a black leader of the CPUSA, by the U.S. government. The statement emphasizes that Winston's life is still in danger. The Communist Party of the United States calls for a wide-ranging struggle to win Winston's complete release.

The statement said that Winston, a leader of the Communist Party of the United States, is a victim of the notorious Smith Act, an anti-communist law. Torture in prison has seriously damaged Winston's health. Under pressure from world public opinion, the U.S. government was forced to abandon its attempt to transfer Winston from New York to Springfield Prison Hospital in Missouri and decided to send him to Staten Island National Hospital in New York.

The statement pointed out, however, that the U.S. Department of Justice still wants to send Winston back to prison. Sending him to the hospital on Staten Island now is only to await the court's final decision on his future sentence.

The New York "Worker's Weekly," published by the CPUSA, reprinted an editorial from the West Coast "People's World" on the 3rd, pointing out that the U.S. government's persecution of Winston is "virtually a form of chronic torture." The editorial said that in some ways, this abuse of Winston is more shocking than the insane acts of the mob. This abuse is carried out by the American bureaucracy in a cold, insidious, and deliberately life-threatening manner.

"The People's World" pointed out: "If the intervention of people outside the prison had not finally forced the prison authorities to agree to give him proper medical treatment and allow private surgeons to treat him, he would have long been beyond rescue.

"The (U.S.) Department of Justice, which is responsible for the crime of torturing Winston, is still not satisfied. It wants to persecute Winston further. It insists on continuing to detain Winston and insists on letting Winston's life and health be at the mercy of the prison authorities again." "The People's World" said that people remember that the "crime" for which the U.S. government sentenced Winston to imprisonment was only that he "conspired" to publicize and advocate a political proposition. Thus, the irrationality and cruelty of this chronic torture is even more obvious.

    美国共产党再次发出号召
    广泛展开争取释放温斯顿运动
    在世界舆论的压力下，美国政府被迫决定把温斯顿送到纽约斯塔腾岛国立医院。但是，应该对温斯顿施行酷刑的罪行负责的美国司法部还要进一步迫害温斯顿。它坚持让温斯顿的生命和健康再度受监狱当局的摆布。
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党再次为美国政府迫害美共黑人领袖亨利·温斯顿发表声明。声明着重指出，温斯顿的生命仍然在危险中。美国共产党号召广泛展开争取完全释放温斯顿的斗争。
    声明说，美国共产党领袖温斯顿是恶名昭彰的史密斯反共法案的受害者。监狱的折磨已严重损害了温斯顿的健康。在世界舆论的压力下，美国政府被迫放弃了把温斯顿从纽约转移到密苏里州的斯普林菲尔德监狱医院的企图，并且决定把他送到纽约斯塔腾岛国立医院。
    声明指出，但是美国司法部仍然想把温斯顿送回监狱里去。现在把他送到斯塔腾岛的医院只是为了等候法院对他今后的徒刑作出最后决定。
    美共出版的纽约“工人周报”3日转载了美国西海岸“人民世界报”的一篇社论，指出美国政府对温斯顿的迫害“实际上是一种慢性的私刑”。社论说，在某些方面，对温斯顿的这种残害比暴徒的疯狂行径更令人震惊。这种残害是美国官僚机构用冷酷的、阴险的、有意玩忽人命的办法来进行的。
    “人民世界报”指出：“如果不是监狱外面人们的干预终于迫使监狱当局同意给他进行适当的医治和准许私人外科医生为他治疗，他早已没有营救余地了。
    “应该对温斯顿施行酷刑的罪行负责的（美国）司法部仍旧不满足。它还要进一步迫害温斯顿。它坚持继续拘留温斯顿，坚持让温斯顿的生命和健康再度受监狱当局摆布。”“人民世界报”说，人们记得，美国政府据以判处温斯顿徒刑的“罪名”只是他“阴谋”宣传和提倡一种政治主张。这样，这种慢性私刑的无理与残酷就更为明显了。
