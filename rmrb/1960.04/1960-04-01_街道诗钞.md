Street Poetry Collection

    With service groups,
    No worries about manpower shortage,
    Thousands of families are as one,
    Difficulties collapse like mountains.
    Happy events abound on Red Flag Street,
    Everyone sings the song of cooperation,
    You help me, I assist you, becoming the fashion,
    Tiny strengths converge into a river.
    Red flags flutter in streets and alleys,
    New looks are changed in the great leap forward's sound,
    Set up the omnipotent service station everywhere,
    The people's lives are organized well.
    One patch, one heart,
    Each stitch is full of deep affection,
    Washed, mended, and worn on the body,
    Producing and not forgetting the mender.
    Public canteens and nurseries,
    The Great Leap Forward liberates me,
    Household labor is socialized,
    Work with peace of mind.
      〔Originally published in Chongqing Daily〕
    Granny Wang, smiling broadly,
    Tells people about happy events,
    Spent her whole life revolving around the stove,
    Now I also have a job.
    During the day, I am in the nursery,
    Leading the children to sing folk songs,
    At night, I study under the lamp,
    Chairman Mao's works in hand.
    Studying the works makes me more energetic,
    The more I work, the happier I am.
    Someone jokes with me,
    Saying I am almost like a young person,
    How can such days not be happy,
    I smile broadly even in my dreams.
      〔Originally published in Changjiang Daily〕
    Since we have the service station,
    We lonely old people are taken care of,
    Bedridden for more than two months,
    Sending tea, water, and food.
    Coming several times a day,
    Asking about my health and well-being.
    If it were the old society in the past,
    Who would care for poor, lonely old people.
    With the good leadership of the Party,
    The lonely old are no longer lonely and get warmth.
    Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao,
    When I recover, I am determined to work hard.
        〔Originally published in Hubei Daily〕

### 街道诗钞

    街道诗钞
    有了服务组，
    不愁人手少，
    千家如一家，
    困难如山倒。
    红旗街上喜事多，
    人人都唱协作歌，
    你帮我助成风尚，
    点滴力量汇成河。
    街巷里弄红旗飘，
    跃进声中改新貌，
    遍设万能服务站，
    人民生活组织好。
    一个补钉一颗心，
    针针线线情意深，
    洗净补好穿身上，
    生产不忘缝补人。
    公共食堂托儿所，
    大跃进来解放我，
    家务劳动社会化，
    安安心心搞工作。
      〔原载重庆日报〕
    王太婆，笑呵呵，
    见人就把喜事说，
    一辈子围着锅台转，
    如今我也有工作。
    白天我在托儿所，
    引着小伢唱山歌，
    晚上灯下忙学习，
    毛主席著作手中托。
    学了著作干劲高，
    越搞工作越快活。
    有人和我开玩笑，
    说我和青年差不多，
    这样的日子怎么不快活，
    梦里我也笑呵呵。
      〔原载长江日报〕
    自从有了服务站，
    我们孤老得照看，
    卧病在床两月多，
    送茶送水又送饭。
    一天来几遍，
    问长又问短。
    要是过去旧社会，
    穷苦孤老有谁管。
    有了党的好领导，
    孤老不孤得温暖。
    感谢党和毛主席，
    病好决心努力干。
        〔原载湖北日报〕
