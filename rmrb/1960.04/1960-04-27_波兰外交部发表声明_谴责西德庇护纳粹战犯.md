Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 25th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the Polish Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the West German authorities for sheltering Hitler's war criminals.

The statement said that the West German authorities have not taken any measures to try Hitler's war criminals and give them their due punishment. On the contrary, it has restricted the possibility of people bringing charges against Hitler's war criminals, abandoning the principles established during the Nuremberg trials of major war criminals.

The statement pointed out that even in cases where the criminal facts and evidence of Hitler's war criminals are conclusive, the West German authorities have not tried them, but have instead allowed many war criminals to hold high-ranking positions in West Germany.

The statement pointed out that the reason why the West German authorities are doing this is because the West German government is relying on militarism, border revisionism, and revanchist forces in pursuing its domestic policy. The statement said that the Polish Foreign Ministry expresses its indignation at these actions by the West German government that undermine the principles of law and justice and threaten world peace.

    波兰外交部发表声明
    谴责西德庇护纳粹战犯
    新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰外交部发表声明，谴责西德当局庇护希特勒战犯的行为。
    声明中说，西德当局没有采取任何措施来审判希特勒战犯并给予他们应有的惩办。相反，它还限制人们对希特勒战犯提出控告的可能性，抛弃在纽伦堡审讯主要战犯时所确定的原则。
    声明指出，甚至在希特勒战犯犯罪事实和证据确凿的情况下，西德当局也没有对他们进行审判，反而让许多战犯在西德担任高级职务。
    声明指出，西德当局之所以这样做，是因为西德政府在奉行它的对内政策时，是依靠军国主义、改变边界主义和复仇主义势力的。声明说，波兰外交部对西德政府的这些破坏法权和正义原则，威胁世界和平的行为表示愤慨。
