    Eternal Friendship
    Chairman of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association, Qu Wu
    Every spring, we celebrate the rebirth of the Hungarian people with excitement. Fifteen years ago today, when the heroic Soviet Red Army and the Hungarian people liberated the last piece of Hungarian land from the enslavement of fascist Germany, an eternal spring appeared on this long-suffering land.
    For fifteen years, under the leadership of the Hungarian working-class party, the heroic Hungarian people have overcome numerous difficulties and worked tenaciously to build socialism, achieving one victory after another. Thanks to the successful completion of the three-year plan for the restoration of the national economy and the first five-year plan, impoverished and backward Hungary has become a prosperous and developed socialist industrial and agricultural country. In October 1956, international reactionary forces headed by US imperialism and Hungarian counter-revolutionaries launched a counter-revolutionary riot, attempting to subvert the people's regime in Hungary; however, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár and with the assistance of the Soviet army, the Hungarian people thoroughly crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The Hungarian people continued to advance firmly along the bright road of socialism, not only quickly making up for the losses caused by the counter-revolutionary riot, but also accelerating the pace of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The three-year plan that began in 1958 reached the targets scheduled for completion in 1960 in terms of important products a year ahead of schedule at the end of 1959. The material living standards of the people have also been greatly improved. This is a victory for the Hungarian people, a victory for the socialist system. The Chinese people regard the victory of the Hungarian people as their own victory and are proud of the great achievements made by the Hungarian people. Currently, the Hungarian people are enthusiastically responding to the fighting call put forward by the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and are striving to complete the groundwork for socialism in the next few years. We believe that this great goal of the Hungarian people will surely be achieved smoothly.
    Both China and Hungary are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the friendship between our two peoples is unbreakable. As early as before the victory of our two peoples' revolutions, the common fate of being oppressed brought our two peoples closer, with mutual sympathy and encouragement. But only after both sides became socialist countries did our friendship develop widely and have rich content. And our friendship has been strengthened even more in the common struggle to strive for lasting world peace against imperialism and in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and opposing modern revisionism. This friendship of ours, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, is a noble friendship that has never existed in human history, and it will emit an even more brilliant light as history advances.
    Although China and Hungary are separated by thousands of miles, the hearts of the two peoples are closely linked. In this short decade, China and Hungary have established close cooperative relations in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Since 1950, our two countries have successively signed a series of agreements on trade, culture, science, and technology. In May 1959, the two countries signed the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which is a milestone in the further development of Sino-Hungarian friendly and cooperative relations. The leaders of our two parties and countries have made mutual visits many times, which is not only an important symbol of our deep friendship, but also further strengthens this friendship. Comrade Kádár and Comrade Münnich have successively visited our country. In 1959, the Hungarian party and government delegation headed by Chairman Dobi came to China to participate in our country's celebration of the tenth anniversary of its founding. They not only brought the friendship of the Hungarian people to the Chinese people, but also gave great encouragement to the Chinese people. Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Tan Zhenlin of our country have also successively brought the sincere brotherly friendship of the Chinese people to the Hungarian people.
    Our two peoples have consistently united, cooperated closely, and supported each other in international affairs, making significant contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting the cause of human progress. Since 1951, the economic cooperation between China and Hungary has continued to develop. In order to help China's industrial construction, the Hungarian government has dispatched many outstanding experts and provided high-quality equipment, for which the Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude. In terms of culture, exchanges are even more frequent. In recent years, the cultural cooperation agreements between the two countries have been implemented very effectively, and many cultural, educational, scientific, health, and sports delegations, as well as representatives from other fields, have been sent to each other. The successive establishment of the friendship associations of the two countries has played a positive role in further developing our friendship. On the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary, the delegation of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association came to our country to participate in the "Sino-Hungarian Friendship Week" activities. They brought the precious friendship of the Hungarian people, and will also see with their own eyes the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people towards the Hungarian people.
    We cherish the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples and firmly believe that this friendship will flow continuously like the Yangtze River and the Danube River, and it cannot be destroyed by any force. On this day of celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary, our hearts are filled with infinite friendship for the Hungarian people. Let us shout:
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples!

    永恒的友谊
    中匈友好协会会长　屈武
    每年的春天，我们都以兴奋的心情庆祝匈牙利人民这个获得新生的节日。十五年前的今天，当英勇的苏联红军和匈牙利人民把匈牙利最后一块土地从法西斯德国的奴役下解放出来的时候，在这个久经苦难的土地上就出现了永恒的春天。
    十五年来，英勇的匈牙利人民在匈牙利工人阶级政党的领导下，战胜重重困难，顽强地建设着社会主义，取得了一个接一个的胜利。由于恢复国民经济的三年计划和第一个五年计划的胜利完成，贫困落后的匈牙利已经变成一个繁荣的发达的社会主义的工业农业国了。1956年10月，以美帝国主义为首的国际反动势力和匈牙利的反革命分子，发动了反革命暴乱，妄图颠复匈牙利的人民政权；但是，匈牙利人民在以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，在苏联军队的援助下，彻底地粉碎了反革命叛乱。匈牙利人民继续沿着社会主义的光明大道坚定地奋勇前进，不仅迅速弥补了由于反革命暴乱所造成的损失，而且加快了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的步伐。从1958年开始的三年计划，已提前一年于1959年底在重要产品方面达到了预定在1960年完成的指标。人民的物质生活水平也有了很大的提高。这是匈牙利人民的胜利，这是社会主义制度的胜利。中国人民把匈牙利人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利，并且为匈牙利人民所取得的伟大成就而感到骄傲。目前，匈牙利人民正在热烈响应匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会提出的战斗号召，为在最近几年内完成社会主义奠基工作而奋斗。我们相信，匈牙利人民的这一伟大目标一定能顺利实现。
    中匈两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭的成员，我们两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。早在我们两国人民革命胜利以前，共同的受压迫的命运就曾使我们两国人民相互接近，相互同情，相互鼓舞。但只有当双方都成为社会主义国家后，我们的友谊才有了广泛的发展和丰富的内容。而我们的这种友谊又在共同的争取世界持久和平反对帝国主义的斗争中，在保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁、反对现代修正主义的斗争中锻炼得更为坚强。我们这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础之上的友谊是人类历史上从来没有过的崇高的友谊，它将随着历史的前进而日益发出更为灿烂的光辉。
    中匈两国虽然遥隔万里，但是两国人民的心是紧密相连的。在这短短的十年中，中匈两国之间在政治、经济和文化各个方面都建立了紧密的合作关系。从1950年起，我们两国先后签订了贸易、文化、科学、技术等一系列的协定。1959年5月，两国又签订了中匈友好合作条约，这是中匈友好合作关系进一步发展的里程碑。我们两国的党和国家领导人多次进行了相互访问，这不仅是我们之间的深厚友谊的重要标志，同时也进一步增强了这种友谊。卡达尔同志、明尼赫同志曾先后访问了我国，1959年，以道比主席为首的匈牙利党政代表团到中国参加了我国建国十周年庆祝活动。他们不仅带来了匈牙利人民对中国人民的友谊，也给中国人民以极大的鼓舞。我国的朱德同志、周恩来同志、谭震林同志也曾先后把中国人民的诚挚的兄弟情谊带给了匈牙利人民。
    我们两国人民在国际事务上一贯团结一致，紧密合作，相互支持，为维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业作出了重大贡献。从1951年起，中匈两国的经济合作关系不断发展。为了帮助中国的工业建设，匈牙利政府派遣了不少优秀专家，提供了质量优良的设备，中国人民对此表示衷心的感谢。在文化方面，来往更是频繁。几年来，两国之间的文化合作协定执行得很有成效，相互派遣了许多文化、教育、科学、卫生、体育代表团，以及其它各方面的代表。两国友好协会的相继成立，对于进一步发展我们的友谊起到了积极的作用。在匈牙利解放十五周年的时候，匈中友好协会代表团来到了我国参加“中匈友好周”的活动。他们带来了匈牙利人民珍贵的友谊，也将亲眼看到中国人民对匈牙利人民的兄弟般的友情。
    我们十分珍惜中匈两国人民之间的永恒的友谊，并且坚信，这种友谊犹如长江和多瑙河一样长流不息，它是任何力量都破坏不了的。在这庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年的日子里，我们的心中荡漾着对匈牙利人民的无限友情。让我们高呼：
    中匈两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
