Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th: Indian public opinion condemns the Indian right-wing forces' conspiracy to sabotage the upcoming meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India, and exposes these forces' plot to incite anti-China hysteria and interfere in China's internal affairs through the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference."

The latest issue of the Urdu weekly "People's Century" revealed in an editorial that newspapers controlled by large enterprises and some people employed by the United States are trying their best to undermine the settlement of the Sino-Indian dispute. The weekly pointed out, "Now their conspiracy is to try to make the Nehru-Zhou Enlai talks end in failure."

The weekly exposed all aspects of this reactionary conspiracy. It said, "Kripalani (leader of the People's Socialist Party), members of the People's League, and other provocative newspapers all want us to issue an ultimatum to China, regardless of the consequences." The weekly accused them of conspiring to prevent the Sino-Indian talks from reaching any agreement.

The weekly said that the second aspect of this conspiracy is the planned demonstration against Zhou Enlai. The weekly condemned this as a shameful act.

The weekly said that the third aspect of this conspiracy is the continuous propaganda against the Sino-China-Nepal agreement. The weekly said that these elements "feel very uncomfortable when they see Asian countries beginning to unite. They believe that peace and agreement are their own failure. In our opinion, they will intensify this shameless propaganda during Zhou Enlai's visit here. This may be exactly what their American masters want. The Indian people should be wary of them."

The weekly pointed out that the fourth aspect of this conspiracy is the "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" scheduled to begin in New Delhi on April 9th, which aims to incite anti-China hysteria and interfere in China's internal affairs. The weekly said: "Since India has recognized that Tibet is part of China, recognized the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and declared that we do not intend to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, then to what extent is it correct to allow these saboteurs to gather in Delhi under such circumstances?" The weekly said, "We have made a serious mistake by allowing these saboteurs to gather in Delhi."

The latest issue of the "Blitz" weekly revealed that "some people in India are frantically and systematically carrying out large-scale activities in an attempt to create a bad atmosphere for Prime Minister Nehru and undermine the prospects for a friendly settlement of the Sino-Indian dispute." It exposed the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" as a meeting attended by imperialist running dogs. It said, "The Dulles faction outside the Indian Parliament is trying to delay the proposed Afro-Asian Tibet Conference in order to coincide the meeting with Zhou Enlai's visit to Delhi."

The weekly also revealed various sabotage activities by the triangular alliance of the Indian Liberal Party, the People's League, and the People's Socialist Party.

The "Indian Express" reported on April 8 that Acharya Vinoba Bhave, the leader of the Indian Land Gift Movement, said at a gathering near Sonepat in Punjab on the evening of the 7th that China and India will definitely be close and friendly, and nothing should be done to worsen the current poor relations between the two countries.

Bhave criticized the recent behavior of some people in India spreading distrust of China and preparing to hold anti-China demonstrations during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. He said that in any case, there is no excuse for the current Sino-Indian border dispute to become a cold war. The two countries have no other way but to maintain friendly relations.

The newspaper said that when Bhave spoke at a meeting in Tikarana on the 4th, he said: Any discord between China and India is detrimental not only to the two countries but also to the entire world. He hoped that the upcoming talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India on the border issue in New Delhi would achieve positive results. He called on the Indian people to believe in China's sincerity.

The "Glorious Newspaper" said in its editorial on the 5th that the demonstration planned by some right-wing parties in India during Premier Zhou's visit to India "is an act that should be strongly condemned, and it will have a bad impact on the world." The "Solidarity Newspaper" pointed out that holding reactionary demonstrations "is tantamount to insulting our own country."

The "Wenhui Daily" said: "Inviting someone and then holding a demonstration to oppose him is an insult to the morality of the people."

The "National Herald" pointed out in its editorial on the 7th that Kripalani, the leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, and the leaders of other reactionary parties, who deliberately sabotage the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India, "have no right to speak on behalf of all the people. They do not represent anything other than their strength as a parliamentary group in the parliament."

The newspaper said that the leaders of these reactionary parties are good at shouting loudly. They are only trying to strengthen their own position.

    印度舆论揭露右翼势力的阴谋活动
    强调中印总理会晤不容破坏
    新华社新德里8日电　印度舆论谴责印度右翼势力企图破坏中印两国总理即将举行会晤的阴谋，揭露这些势力策划目的在于煽动反华歇斯底里、干涉中国内政的所谓“亚非西藏会议”。
    最近一期的乌尔都文周刊“人民世纪”在社论中揭露大企业控制的报纸和一些为美国雇用的人们竭力破坏中印争端的解决。这家周刊指出，“现在他们的阴谋就是设法让尼赫鲁—周恩来会谈以失败告终”。
    这家周刊揭露了这个反动阴谋的各个方面。它说：“克里帕拉尼（人民社会党首领）、人民同盟分子和其他挑衅性的报纸都希望我们对中国发出最后通牒，而不顾后果如何”。这家周刊指责他们阴谋使中印会谈达不成任何协议。
    这家周刊说，这个阴谋的第二个方面就是计划中的反对周恩来的示威。这家周刊谴责这是一种可耻的行动。
    这家周刊说，这个阴谋的第三个方面就是不断地进行反对中国—尼泊尔协定的宣传。这家周刊说，这些分子“看到亚洲各国正在开始团结的时候，感到十分不舒服。他们认为和平和协议就是自己的失败。照我们看来，在周恩来访问这里的时候，他们将加紧进行这种无耻的宣传。这也许正是他们的美国主子们所希望的。印度人民应当提防他们”。
    这家周刊指出，这个阴谋的第四个方面就是定于4月9日在新德里开始的目的在于煽动反华歇斯底里干涉中国内政的“亚非西藏会议”。这家周刊说：“既然印度已经承认西藏是中国的一部分，承认和平共处五项原则，并且宣布我们不打算干涉他国的内政，那么在这种情况下，允许这些破坏分子在德里集合的作法在多大程度上是正确的呢。”这家周刊说，“我们允许这些破坏分子在德里集会是犯了严重的错误”。
    最近一期的“闪电”周报揭露，印度“有人正在疯狂地、有计划地大肆活动，企图为尼赫鲁总理造成恶劣的气氛，破坏友好解决中印争端的前景”。它揭露所谓“亚非西藏会议”是由帝国主义走狗们参加的会议。它说，“印度国会院外亲杜勒斯集团正设法拖延拟议中的亚非西藏会议，以便使这个会议同周恩来访问德里的时间吻合起来”。
    周报并且揭露了印度自由党、人民同盟和人民社会党的三角联盟的各种破坏活动。
    “印度快报”8日报道说，印度献地运动领袖阿查里雅·维诺巴·巴维7日晚在旁遮普的索奈帕特附近的一次集会上说，中印两国一定会亲密友好，不应该作任何事情来使两国目前关系不好的局面恶化。
    巴维指责最近印度一些人散布对中国的不信任和准备在周恩来总理访问印度期间举行反华示威的行为。他说，无论如何，没有任何借口可以使目前的中印边界争端成为一场冷战。两国除了保持友好关系以外，别无其他途径。
    这家报纸说，巴维4日在蒂卡拉纳一次会议上讲话时曾说：中印两国之间的任何不和，不单对它们两国，而且对整个世界都是不利的。他希望即将在新德里举行的中印两国总理关于边界问题的会谈，将取得积极的结果。他呼吁印度人民要相信中国的诚意。
    “光荣报”在5日的社论中说，印度一些右派政党策划在周总理访问印度时举行示威“是应当大力加以谴责的行为，它会对世界产生不良的影响”。“团结报”指出，举行反动示威“等于侮辱我们自己的国家”。
    “文汇报”说：“邀请某人而又举行示威来反对他，这是对人民的德道的一种侮辱”。
    “国民先驱报”在7日的社论中指出，蓄意破坏中印两国总理会晤的印度人民社会党首领克里帕拉尼和其他反动党派的首领“无权代表全体人民说话，他们除了在国会中作为议会党团的力量以外，不代表任何东西”。
    这家报纸说，这些反动党派的首领善于大叫大嚷。他们只是企图加强他们自己的地位。
