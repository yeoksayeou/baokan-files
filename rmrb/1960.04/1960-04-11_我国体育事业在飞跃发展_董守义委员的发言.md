Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:
    I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

    These reports truly made me unable to restrain my joy and excitement, and they were also a very memorable education for me. I have a clearer understanding that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can our motherland's construction cause achieve such great results in all aspects, and only then can such a magnificent national economic plan for 1960 be produced.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report that "all economic sectors continued to achieve a great leap forward in development speed in 1959. While the economy was developing greatly, science, education, culture, sports, and health undertakings also achieved great development." In the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, he also pointed out that "We must continue to vigorously develop mass sports activities in both urban and rural areas, and promote exercises, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming, shooting, boxing, and various other sports activities, and improve the level of sports on the basis of popularization." As a sports worker, I felt boundless joy and emotion when I read these two passages. I am increasingly aware that the Party's leadership is always correct. Thinking of this, I cannot help but recall the state of sports during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Comparing that situation with the situation of sports after liberation vividly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. The Party values sports and cares about the life, welfare, and health of the 600 million people, and only under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line can our country's sports achieve such great leap forward miracles.

    Now let me cite some examples to illustrate how different China's sports are now compared to the past, these facts are not things that I have just heard but things that I have experienced and seen personally, and I am not exaggerating. Due to my low level of theoretical understanding, please criticize and correct any inaccuracies.

    Achievements in China's Sports
    According to my research, track and field and modern football began in China in 1880. Basketball began in 1896, so by the time of liberation in 1949, they already had a history of sixty years. What level had China's track and field reached in such a long period of time? If we compare China's pre-liberation records with international standards, it is still at the international level of 1896-1900.

    China participated in the Far Eastern Games from 1913 to 1934, a total of ten times. During the eighth session held in Shanghai in 1927, China got zero points in track and field. At the ninth session held in Tokyo in 1930, we only got fourth place in the triple jump, which was one point. That time, points were awarded to the top four, but if it had been like the past, with points only for the top three, we would still have zero points. Before liberation, China participated in the Olympic Games three times in 1932, 1936, and 1948. In track and field, not only was there no hope of winning a championship, but we didn't even qualify for the finals. We couldn't even reach our own original records. Only in the pole vault in 1936 did we pass the qualifying round. In other running events, we were always in last place. At that time, it was truly embarrassing to see this situation. As for football, we were eliminated in the first round. In a football match visiting Austria, we lost by a humiliating score of eleven to zero.

    Looking at the situation after liberation, in just a short ten years, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1959, not only have many track and field events reached international standards, Zheng Fengrong set a new world record in the women's high jump in 1957, but in track and field, swimming, weightlifting, shooting, parachuting and other sports, forty people have broken eighteen world records twenty-six times. Rong Guotuan also won the world men's singles title in table tennis. Recalling that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang from 1936 to 1948, only seven records were broken in dozens of track and field events for both men and women. In the ten years after liberation, under the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao, China's sports have become the cause of all the people. It has developed rapidly in all aspects, and a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged on the basis of mass sports. By the end of last year, China had 39 people who had created and broken world records 31 times in eighteen sports, and broken national records more than 3,860 times. The speed of improvement in China's sports technical level is not only incomparable to that of old China, but also far behind the capitalist world. In the short period of ten years after liberation, we have reached the level of world record creators and world champions in some sports. The capitalist world's sports took sixty years to develop to the current international level. Our sports, however, have developed to this international level in just ten years. That is to say, the sixty-year road that the capitalist world's sports have travelled from the first Olympic Games in 1896 to today's international level, we have completed in just one-sixth of the time they took. We have caught up with them. It is not difficult to imagine that we will surpass them in the near future. Our achievements in international competitions in the past two years are known to all. How exciting this is for us! Such brilliant achievements fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, and also prove that only by relying on the leadership of the Party and adhering to the mass line can the development of sports be guaranteed; conversely, if we deviate from the leadership of the Party and do not follow the mass line, sports will certainly not be able to develop at such a speed.

    Sports Then and Now
    When China participated in the 11th Olympic Games in 1936 and the 14th Olympic Games in 1948, our football team went abroad early to places like Southeast Asia, India, and Burma. In name, it was to observe techniques, but in reality, it was to raise travel expenses for participating in the Games. After the 1948 London Games, the delegation had no money to return home, so they telegraphed the reactionary Kuomintang government requesting funds. What was the result? No one could imagine that the reply they received was to tell the delegation to find their own way abroad, abandoning their own country's delegation abroad. What a disgraceful thing for the country. It was outrageous. Later, the delegation had to raise funds from overseas Chinese, even foreigners, to return home. This is such a huge difference from the way our current sports delegations are taken care of meticulously by the Party and the government when they go abroad!

    In the old society, when sports meets were held, the mutual jealousy, quarrels, and fights between athletes, between athletes and referees, between athletes and spectators, between referees, between staff members, between staff members and newspaper reporters, between spectators, between team leaders, and even between team leaders and the organizing committee, as well as the referees carrying guns to referee, lawsuits in court, and even beatings that resulted in injuries or deaths, were very common occurrences. If you open the records and newspapers of sports meets in the old society, there are countless examples of this kind.

    Let's look at what happened after liberation when sports meets were held. Take the first National Games held last year as an example. More than 10,000 athletes participated in the Games, there were 42 competition events, the competition period was so long, and the scale was so large, not only had it never happened in old China, but even world sports meets had never had it. This was an unprecedented event in the history of sports. Organizing such a large-scale sports meet was not an easy task. Whether it was in the execution of the competition or in the entry and exit of more than 80,000 spectators, everything was handled in an orderly manner. This shows the organization and discipline of this Games. What particularly moved me was that many teams showed a spirit of mutual assistance, no arrogance in victory, and no discouragement in defeat during the competition. Some small problems are difficult to avoid on the competition field, but the question is how to solve them. We all used the method of presenting the facts and reasoning to explain and persuade. Therefore, everyone was very satisfied and obeyed the solution. Even if the referees made some mistakes, they would conduct self-criticism to correct the mistakes. In this way, the phenomenon of quarreling and fighting in the old society was completely eliminated. Our athletes achieved the level of losing the game but not losing their dignity. This is something that is difficult to achieve in competition. Our noble qualities and excellent style in sportsmanship have also been demonstrated in any international competition and are praised internationally. I deeply realize that this is a brilliant achievement cultivated by Mao Zedong Thought.

    China's International Standing in Sports
    In 1932, when the 10th Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, a Chinese student sent a letter to the Tianjin Sports Weekly, mentioning that he was sitting in the stands when he heard two foreigners say: "I heard that a one-man Chinese delegation is also participating in this Games. Can Chinese people run? I'd like to see him run." What a sarcastic remark that was.

    In 1936, when the Chinese football team participated in the 11th Olympic Games, some foreigners said, "Can China also play football?" When they saw someone with good skills, they would say that he was Japanese. They called China the "Sick Man of East Asia," as everyone knows. That was how low our country's status was at that time. I have already briefly described above what the new face of our sports is after liberation and what level of international standing we have reached. I will only quote here a passage published in the London Evening Standard. Under the headline "China Has Taught Us Another Lesson," it said: "British table tennis players must study hard before competing with players from the Far East. This is the lesson of the last six games. They seem helpless in the face of these agile, fast, straight-grip Chinese players, especially in dealing with their cunning serves." The London News Morning Post headline: "China Maintains Undefeated Record in Britain," the London News headline: "China Overwhelms Britain," the chairman of the English Table Tennis Association, Vent, commented: "This visit of the Chinese table tennis team to Britain has not only strengthened the friendship between the table tennis associations of the two countries, but it is also much broader, it should be said to strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries." Last year, the Swedish Jugarden Club football team visited China for ten days. The team had never lost in 29 games in the Far East in the past. The result of this visit was: the Swedish team won one, lost one, and drew two. After my Beijing team defeated the team 1-0, it caused a great shock in Northern Europe. I will quote two sentences from an article written by the team leader Berg for my Sports News before he left China, in which he expressed his feelings. He said, "We can say without hesitation that the skills of Chinese players can at least be compared with those of the world-famous Hungarian and South American football players. We thought that we could gain some advantage in terms of physical strength and endurance, but even in this we were wrong, our opponents are not bad physically." We see, how different the past and the present are!

    Popularization of Sports
    Before liberation, our working people were oppressed and exploited by reactionary forces at home and abroad, and it was difficult to maintain even the minimum human living standards, let alone the right to participate in sports. As everyone knows, our current sports have gradually penetrated into the broad masses of workers and peasants and will soon be extended to every corner of the countryside. What a huge change this is! Isn't this the great achievement produced by the three cheers of "Long Live"?

    In addition, the facilities, training of sports cadres, and measures we have today in sports are also significantly different compared to the old China in the past. This is also something that you all understand, so there is no need for me to elaborate. In short, in a nutshell: without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no such leap forward development in our sports today.

    Since I was rescued by the Party and allowed to return to the team, my mood has been infinitely comfortable and excited, and my gratitude is beyond words to describe. At the same time, I realize that the thorough ideological transformation that I need cannot be achieved quickly in a short period of time, but must go through a long, arduous, repeated, and meticulous process. I am now only taking the first step in the long march on the long road of transformation. But I am determined to reach this goal, so that I can live up to the Party and the people. In the future, I will contribute all my strength to my work under the leadership of the Party. I will also transform myself steadily and without slackening, to become an intellectual of the working class, to better serve China's sports cause.

    Finally, I wish all the committee members good health. (Attached picture)

### 我国体育事业在飞跃发展  董守义委员的发言

专栏：

    我国体育事业在飞跃发展
    董守义委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和衷心地拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    这些报告真是使我情不自禁地欢欣鼓舞，也是我很难忘的一次教育。我更清楚地体会到，我国人民只有在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，祖国建设事业在各方面才能取得这样巨大的成绩，也才能产生1960年的这样一个宏伟的国民经济计划。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出“所有的经济部门在1959年都继续取得了大跃进的发展速度。在经济事业大发展的同时，科学、教育、文化、体育、卫生事业也都得到了大发展”，在1960年国民经济计划草案的报告中又指出“继续大力开展城乡的群众性的体育运动，要提倡做操、打球、赛跑、爬山、游泳、射击、打拳及各色各样的体育活动，并且在普及的基础上，提高运动水平”。我是一个体育工作者，读到以上这两段话，心里真有无限的高兴和感触。我越来越清楚地认识到党的领导永远是正确的。想到这里，使我不能不回忆国民党反动统治时代的体育是怎样一种情况。拿那种情况和解放后的体育情况来两相对比一下，就极鲜明地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。党重视体育和关怀六亿人民的生活福利健康以及我国体育是在党的总路线光辉照耀下才有这样大跃进的种种奇迹。
    现在让我向大家举出一些实例来说明我国体育运动的过去和现在是如何的天地悬殊，这些事实都不是我听来的，乃是我亲自经验过和亲眼看见过的，绝不是过甚其辞。由于我的理论水平很低，其中不正确的地方，请同志们多加批评指正。
    我国体育运动的成绩
    据我的考证，田径赛和近代足球在我国于1880年就开始了。篮球在1896年就开始了，至1949年解放的那一年已经有六十年的历史了。在这样悠久的岁月中，我国田径的水平达到了一个什么程度呢？把我国解放前的纪录摆出来同国际水平一比，它仍然是站在1896至1900年的国际水平线上。
    我国从1913年就参加远东运动会，至1934年共参加了十次之多。1927年在上海举行的第八届大会时，我国田径得了个零分。1930年在东京举行的第九届大会上只得了三级跳远第四名，而得到一分。在这次是取四名，如像过去一样，还是取三名的话，就仍然是零分。解放前，我国曾在1932、1936、1948年参加奥林匹克运动会共计三次。在田径赛方面，不要说没有得一项冠军的希望，就连决赛权都没有取得过。甚至连自己原来成绩都达不到。只有在1936年撑竿跳高一项取得了及格赛。其他赛跑项目，没有一项不是列在最末名的。当时看到这种情形真是难以为情。至于足球，早在第一轮就被淘汰了。足球队访问奥地利的比赛，结果输了一个十一比零的惨败。
    再看解放后的情况，仅仅在短短的十年中，特别是在1958至1959年大跃进的两年中，不仅在田径赛方面有许多项目已经达到了国际水平，郑凤荣在1957年创造了世界女子跳高的新纪录，而且在田径、游泳、举重、射击、跳伞等项目中有四十人二十六次破十八项世界纪录。容国团还得了世界乒乓球男子单打冠军。回忆在国民党反动统治下的1936至1948年在田径几十个项目中，男女只改了七次纪录。解放后的十年来，在党和毛主席的领导和关怀下，我国体育事业已成为全民的事业。在各方面得到了迅速的发展，在群众性运动基础上出现了大批的优秀运动员。至上年年底为止，我国在十八个运动项目中，有三十九人创造和打破世界纪录三十一次，突破全国纪录的计有三千八百六十多次。我国体育运动技术水平提高速度，不仅旧中国难与相提并论，就是资本主义世界，也是远远落在后面。我们在解放后，为期很短的十年中，就在一些项目上达到了获得世界纪录创造者和世界冠军的水平的高度。资本主义世界的体育运动是用了六十年的长久时间，才发展到今日的这一个国际水平的高度。而我们的体育运动，仅仅在十年的短期内就发展到了这一个国际水平。这也就是说，资本主义世界的体育运动，从1896年第一届奥林匹克运动会开始发展到今天的国际水平，所走过的六十年的道路，我们只用了他们所用的六分之一的时间就走完了。也就是把他们赶上了。这也就不难想像，我们就要在不久的将来要超过他们的。我们近两年在国际上比赛上的成绩是大家所知道的。这是多么让我们兴奋的事情啊！这样的辉煌成就充分地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，也同样地证明了只有依靠党的领导，坚持群众路线，体育运动的发展才有保证；反之，如果脱离了党的领导，不走群众路线，则体育一定不能有这样发展的速度。
      体育运动的今昔
    我国参加1936年第十一届和1948年第十四届奥林匹克运动会时，我们的足球队提前出国，到南洋、印度、缅甸等地方。名义上是去观摩技术，而实际上是为筹措参加大会的路费。1948年在伦敦大会后，代表团没路费回国，遂打电报给国民党反动政府请款。结果是怎样呢？谁也不能想像，所得到的回电竟是让代表团在国外自己想办法，竟把自己国家的代表团丢在国外不管。这是一件多么给国家丢丑的事情。简直不像话。后来弄得代表团向侨胞，甚至向外国人募款才能回国。这与我们现在的体育代表团在出国时，被党和政府照顾得无微不至的情形，是一个多么巨大的差别呀！
    在过去的旧社会开运动会时，运动员与运动员，运动员与裁判员，运动员与观众，裁判员与裁判员，工作员与工作员，工作员与新闻记者，观众与观众，领队与领队，甚至领队与大会之间，那种互相嫉妒，吵架打骂，还有裁判员带手枪去当裁判，法院起诉，甚至把人打伤打死等等恶劣的行为，是一种很普遍的现象。翻开旧社会运动会的记载和新闻纸一看，这样的例子是多得不可胜举的。
    再看看解放后开运动会时是怎样的一种情况呢？就以去年召开的第一届全运会来说，参加大会的运动员有一万多人，竞赛项目有四十二个，竞赛日期是那么长，规模是那么大，不仅是旧中国没有过，即世界运动会也是没有过的。这是在体育史上空前的一次大会。组织这样大规模的运动会不是一件容易的事情。无论是在执行比赛中，或是在八万多观众的出入场中，都是处理得井井有条不乱。这都说明了这次大会的组织性，纪律性，特别使我感动的是许多队在进行比赛时都表现出互相帮助，胜不骄，败不馁的精神。关于一些小问题，是竞赛场上很难避免的，问题是如何解决它们。我们都是以摆事实，讲道理的方式来解释来说服。因此大家都是甚满意地服从解决的办法，就是裁判员发生点错误也都是从事自我检查来纠正错误。就是这样，把在旧社会里那种吵架打骂的现象完全消灭了。我们的运动员做到了输球而不输人格的程度。这是在竞赛中很难做到的事情。我们的这种在体育道德上的崇高品质，优良作风也在任何国际比赛中都表现出来了，是在国际上被称赞的。我深深地体会到这是由毛主席思想所培养出来的辉煌成就。
    我国体育运动的国际地位
    1932年在洛杉矶开第十届奥林匹克运动会时，有一个中国留学生给天津体育周报来了一封信提到，他坐在看台上听到有两个外国人说：“听说有一个人的中国代表队也参加这次大会，中国人也会跑吗？我倒愿意看看他跑”，这是一种多么讽刺的话。
    1936年中国足球队参加第十一届奥运会时，听有些外国人说，中国也会踢足球吗？遇到他们看见一个技术好点的人，就说他是日本人，他们称中国是东亚病夫，这是大家都知道的。那时我们国家的地位就是这样低。解放后，我们的体育运动是怎样的面貌一新和我们的国际地位达到了怎样的高度水平，我已经在上面简要的说过了。我仅在这里引述在伦敦晚报中所登载的一段话。在“中国又给我们上了一堂课”的标题下面说：“英国乒乓球的男子队员在与远东的队员交锋之前还得好好地学习。这是最近六场比赛的教训。他们在这些灵敏、快速的直板握法的中国选手面前显得束手无策，尤其是应付对方狡猾的发球。”伦敦新闻晨报标题：“中国在英国保持不败纪录”，伦敦新闻报标题：“中国压倒英国”，英格兰乒乓协会主席文特评论说：“中国乒乓球队这次访问英国，不但加强了两国乒乓球协会的友谊，而且范围还要广泛得多，应该说是加强了两国人民之间的友谊。”去年瑞典尤哥登俱乐部足球队来我国访问十天，该队在过去来远东二十九场比赛中从未输过。此次访问比赛，结果是：瑞典队一胜一负、二平。我北京队以一比零胜该队后在北欧引起了很大震动。我再引述该队领队贝尔格在离我国前给我体育报写文章发表感想中的两句话，他说“我们可以毫不犹豫地说，中国球员的技术至少可以和举世闻名的匈牙利和南美足球运动员相比美。我们曾想，在体力和耐久力方面，我们能占些便宜，但是，就连这个我们也想错了，我们对手的身体也不坏。”我们看，今昔对比是多末悬殊啊！
      体育运动的普及
    解放以前，我们劳动人民受着国内外反动派的压迫与剥削，连最低限度的人类生活水平都很难维持，当然更谈不到参加体育运动的权利。大家都知道，我们现在的体育运动已经逐渐地深入到广大的工农群众里面，不久就推广到乡间的每一个角落里面。这又是多么巨大的一个变化呀！这不是由于三个万岁所产生的伟大成果么？
    此外，我们今日在体育的设备，体育干部的培养和措施等种种方面，和过去的旧中国来对比一下，也是显著的不同。这也是诸位都理会到的，无须我来细说。总之，千言万语，一句话：没有中国共产党就没有我们今日体育事业这样飞跃的发展。
    我自从得到了党的挽救，让我归队以来，我的心情是无限的舒畅和兴奋，我感恩的心情是没有言语可以形容的。同时，我认识到我所需要的彻底的思想改造，是不能在短期内速成的，必须经过长期的、艰巨的、反复的、细致的过程。我现在不过是在漫长的改造路程上，走了万里长征的第一步。但我下定决心要达到这个目标，这样才对得起党和人民。今后，我要在党的领导下，对于我的岗位工作，贡献出我所有的力量。我也要踏踏实实地，毫不放松地改造自己，达到成为工人阶级的知识分子，来为中国的体育事业，更好地服务。
    最后祝各位委员们身体健康。（附图片）
