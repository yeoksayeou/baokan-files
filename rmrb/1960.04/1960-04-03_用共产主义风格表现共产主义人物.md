    Expressing Communist Figures with Communist Style
    By Our Commentator
　　The film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," jointly produced by the Beijing Film Studio and more than ten other artistic groups, has been released in the capital. More than ten theatrical groups, including the China Youth Art Theatre, the Experimental Theatre of the Central Academy of Drama, and theatrical groups from Shanxi, Liaoning, Hubei, Hunan, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have also staged this play successively. At the same time, the Central Academy of Drama and the Guangdong Drama Troupe performed a drama praising the "Ma Kou Incident"; the China Children's Theatre performed "Heroic Boy Liu Wenxue." Publishing houses in Beijing and other places quickly published scripts, communications, and comic books reflecting these heroic deeds. It is the task of proletarian literature and art to serve politics, to use literature and art to express the advanced figures among the masses, and to inspire the fighting will of the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, many new atmospheres and new achievements in literature and art have demonstrated the ideological and creative leaps in China's literary and art circles.
    Our era is an era of emerging heroes. The communist style has gradually become a social fashion. This is precisely due to the boundless power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the deep rooting of Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the people. New communist things are constantly emerging in our lives, and these new things are constantly inspiring and educating the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the glorious mission on the shoulders of proletarian literary and art workers has become even heavier, which is how to quickly express the moving and brilliant heroic deeds in the boiling reality of life through appropriate literary and artistic styles in our works, on the stage and screen, and in paintings and musical scores, to educate the broad masses of the people and inspire the people to work together for the great cause of building socialism and communism.
    The filming of the film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" and the production of other dramas were completed in the shortest possible time and at the fastest speed. Completing a film in more than ten working days, and writing and staging a play in three to five days, such enthusiasm and speed can only appear in such an era. Naturally, these works are not perfect, and they all have more or less shortcomings that need to be refined, but this is not the main thing. What is important is this red heart of loyalty to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, this communist style, this full of political enthusiasm and soaring revolutionary spirit, these are the most valuable things in our proletarian literary and art workers, and they are also the basic factors for our literature and art to achieve victory.
    In the creative process of the film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" and other dramas, we can also see a new atmosphere forming among literary and art workers, which is the atmosphere of communist collaboration. The creation of scripts follows the mass line, and filming and performances also follow the mass line. For the common cause, regardless of failure, working together with one heart, providing people when needed, providing equipment when needed, giving convenience to others, and leaving difficulties to oneself. When the audience saw the names of more than ten collaborating performing units lined up at the beginning of the film, they couldn't help but feel excited and applauded repeatedly. This applause is a cheer for the communist style in literary and art circles, and a cheer for the brilliant victory of the Party's literary and art policies and Mao Zedong's literary and art thought!

    用共产主义风格表现共产主义人物
    本报评论员
　　由北京电影制片厂等十多个艺术团体协力拍摄的影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”，已经在首都上映。中国青年艺术剧院、中央戏剧学院实验话剧院、山西、辽宁、湖北、湖南、上海、天津等地十多个戏剧团体，也都先后上演了这个戏。与此同时，中央戏剧学院和广东省话剧团演出了歌颂“马口事件”的话剧；中国儿童剧院演出了“英雄少年刘文学”。北京和其他各地的一些出版社，迅速地出版了反映这些英雄事迹的剧本、通讯和连环画册。文艺为政治服务，用文艺来表现群众中的先进人物，来鼓舞群众的斗志，这是无产阶级文艺的任务。大跃进以来，许多文艺上的新气象、新成绩，都说明了我国文艺界思想上和创作上的跃进。
    我们的时代，是英雄辈出的时代。共产主义风格已经逐渐地成为社会风尚。这正是由于总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三大法宝的威力无边，毛泽东思想深入人心。在我们的生活中，不断地出现共产主义的新事物，这些新事物又不断鼓舞着和教育着广大人民。于是，在无产阶级文学艺术工作者的肩头，更加重了光荣的使命，就是如何在我们的作品里，在舞台和银幕上，在画幅和乐谱中，把沸腾的现实生活中动人的、辉煌的英雄事迹，迅速地通过合适的文学艺术样式，表现出来，教育广大人民群众，鼓舞人民同心同德地为建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而奋斗。
    影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”和其他戏剧的拍摄和演出工作，都是在最短的时间内用最快的速度完成的。十多个工作日拍完一部影片，三、五天内从写剧本到上演一个戏，这样的干劲，这样的速度，也只有在这样的时代才能出现。自然，这些作品并不就是完美无缺的了，它们都还有或多或少的不足之处，需要精益求精，但这不是主要的。重要的是这种为工农兵服务的赤胆忠心，这种共产主义风格，这种饱满的政治热情和冲天的革命干劲，这些是我们无产阶级文艺工作者身上最可贵的东西，也是我们的文学艺术获得胜利的基本因素。
    在影片“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”和其他戏剧的创作过程中，我们也还可以看到一种新的风气正在文艺工作者当中形成，这就是共产主义大协作的风气。剧本创作走群众路线，拍摄和演出也走群众路线。为了共同的事业，不计失败，同心协力，要人有人，要设备有设备，把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己。观众们在看到影片片头上排列了十多个协力演出单位的名字的时候，禁不住心头激动，一再鼓掌。这种掌声，是为文艺界的共产主义风格欢呼，在为党的文艺方针和毛泽东文艺思想的光辉胜利欢呼！
