Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: On the eve of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting, newspapers and news agencies in Western countries such as the United States and Britain, fearing that the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting would achieve progress, have been spreading pessimistic remarks about the Sino-Indian talks and are doing their utmost to provoke Sino-Indian relations.

    The American "New York Herald Tribune" published an editorial on the 19th, saying that the Sino-Indian border issue "is entirely an aggression by its Communist neighbor," and that "good feelings between New Delhi and Beijing will not be restored."

    The "New York Times" published an editorial yesterday, provoking and saying that Nehru was taking a so-called "political risk" by holding talks with China.

    Hoberecht, Vice President and General Manager for Asia of United Press International, in a message from Tokyo on the 18th, slandered China for taking "serious acts of aggression" on the Sino-Indian border, saying that it "currently seems almost impossible" to achieve a satisfactory result in the talks. This news agency also encouraged a "tough policy" towards China. The "Christian Science Monitor" accused China of pursuing "expansionism." The newspaper provoked and said, "Now is the time to begin formulating a firm and clear way to deal with it."

    British bourgeois newspapers also spread the same malicious remarks about the Sino-Indian talks as American newspapers. A "Times" reporter, in a report from New Delhi on the 18th, publicized that the meeting between the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers "will not yield results," and that there is "no obvious starting point for discussion" between the two countries. It said that "India's prestige is already linked to its border claims, and there is no room for maneuver." It wanted India to "cheer up and prepare to deal with an indefinite period of unstable relations with China that remain close to hostile." The "Daily Telegraph" incited to "expel" China, otherwise India's "diplomatic prestige will inevitably decline further."

    唯恐中印会谈获得进展
    美英报刊散布悲观言论
    新华社21日讯　在中印两国总理举行会谈前夕，美、英等西方国家的报纸和通讯社深恐中印两国总理会谈获得进展，因此对中印会谈大肆散布悲观论调，并且竭力挑拨中印关系。
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”在19日发表社论，说什么中印边界问题“完全是它的共产党邻邦的侵略”，说什么“不会恢复新德里和北京之间的良好感情”。
    “纽约时报”昨天发表社论挑拨说，尼赫鲁同中国举行会谈是冒所谓“政治危险”。
    合众国际社副社长兼亚洲总分社社长霍布雷奇特18日从东京发出的消息中污蔑中国在中印边境采取了“严重的侵略行动”，说什么会谈要取得双方满意的结果“目前看来几乎是办不到的”。这家通讯社还怂恿对中国采取“强硬政策”。“基督教科学箴言报”诬蔑中国奉行“扩张主义”。这家报纸挑唆说，“现在是着手制定一个坚定的和清楚的对付办法的时候了。”
    英国资产阶级报纸对中印会谈也散布和美国报刊同样的恶毒论调。“泰晤士报”记者18日自新德里发回的报道中，大肆宣传中印两国总理会晤“不会有结果”，两国之间“没有显见的讨论出发点”。它说什么“印度的威信已经同它的边界要求联结在一起，没有回旋的余地”。它要印度“振作起来准备对付一个同中国保持接近于敌对的不稳关系的无定时期”。“每日电讯报”煽动说要把中国“驱逐”出去，不然印度的“外交威信必然会进一步下降”。
