Xinhua News Agency, Xining, April 13th. Qinghai Province is utilizing the gap between the end of spring sowing and the start of field management, with the entire party and people marching towards the wilderness. From the foot of the Qilian Mountains in the north to the Yushu and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures in the south, and from the eastern agricultural areas to the Alar Grassland under the Altai Mountains, commune members, state farm workers, and government cadres are launching a three-pronged assault, using both animal power and farm tools alongside tractors. They are demonstrating their power on barren mountains and grasslands, conquering one mountain after another, with continuous good news being reported. As of April 7th, the province had newly reclaimed 1.7 million mu of wasteland, which, combined with the more than 3.8 million mu reclaimed last winter, totals over 5.5 million mu. As spring sowing tasks are successively completed in various regions, even more manpower will be投入投入 into the land reclamation movement.

Qinghai Province plans to reclaim an area this year that is much larger than the province's total sown area last year, with an average of more than nine mu of cultivated land to be expanded per agricultural and pastoral laborer. Taking advantage of the time after the end of spring sowing and before the start of field management work, the people of all ethnic groups are aiming to complete more than half of the annual task during the first battle of land reclamation this year. This battle started beautifully, with the speed of land reclamation far exceeding the projected figures. Minhe County, the first in the province to complete spring plowing and sowing, completed its annual land reclamation task of 300,000 mu from March 1st to March 24th, thanks to thorough preparation. By April 6th, it had reclaimed more than 420,000 mu of wasteland. In just over thirty days, each laborer increased cultivated land by an average of more than six mu. The good news of Minhe County completing its annual land reclamation task in one go has caused great repercussions, and all regions have put forward the slogan of "Learn from Minhe, catch up with Minhe, surpass Minhe," and the land reclamation upsurge is rising higher and higher.

The determination and enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province for land reclamation is the result of the thorough implementation of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's policy of "focusing on large-scale land reclamation, expanding cultivated land area, and simultaneously improving unit area yield." Qinghai Province has a small existing cultivated land area, most of which is concentrated in the eastern agricultural area. In recent years, various socialist construction undertakings have developed rapidly, the population has increased significantly, and the demand for grain has been growing. To develop the extremely rich mineral resources here on a large scale, run industries on a large scale, and rapidly change the face of Qinghai, agriculture needs to provide sufficient grain and raw materials. The great development of animal husbandry also requires a substantial increase in the production of feed. Qinghai Province has good soil, long sunshine hours, abundant natural fertilizer sources, and especially a large amount of arable wasteland, making it promising in agricultural development. Therefore, when the Provincial Party Committee issued a call, it was warmly responded to by the people of all ethnic groups.

In the current even larger land reclamation movement, state farm workers and commune members are the main force, especially the agricultural and pastoral farms that own some mechanical equipment. The land reclamation areas are all on vast and flat grasslands, bearing 60% of the total land reclamation task. Government cadres are a new force in land reclamation. They are carrying forward the spirit of the Yan'an era by running government organs' agricultural and pastoral farms on a large scale, striving to gradually achieve "two self-sufficiencies" in vegetables and meat, or "three self-sufficiencies" in grain, vegetables, and meat. At present, cadres of provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county government organs are adopting a combination of professional team land reclamation and amateur land reclamation, and have already reclaimed more than 120,000 mu of wasteland. The provincial-level government organs alone have established 105 agricultural and pastoral farms.

The communist spirit of great collaboration has spread throughout the province in the land reclamation movement. In addition to reclaiming land locally, each commune and team has generally organized expeditions and shock teams to reclaim land in areas with more wasteland. People from the plains areas go to the mountainous areas, and people from the agricultural areas go to the pastoral areas. In the struggle to conquer nature, the people of all ethnic groups break down county and commune boundaries, are as close as a family, and support and cooperate with each other with manpower, animal power, and tools, take care of each other's lives, and strive to make the best use of everything and make the most of the land. At present, in addition to reclaiming more land and reclaiming land quickly, the land reclamation forces are also striving to sow a part of the newly reclaimed land this spring so that there can be a harvest in the same year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, April 13th. Qinghai Province completed the sowing of early-maturing crops more than a month earlier than last year. As of April 7th, the province had sown more than 7.79 million mu of grain crops such as spring wheat and highland barley, which is even larger than the total sown area of early-maturing and late-maturing crops last year. In the areas along the Yellow River and Huangshui River, where plowing started earliest, wheat seedlings have emerged successively.

The early completion of the sowing of early-maturing crops is a great victory in the drought prevention and resistance movement. Qinghai experienced little rain and snow last winter and this spring, and the climate was also warmer. The spring drought appeared earlier than in previous years. Based on this situation, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee called on the people of all ethnic groups in the province as early as January to launch a surprise attack on spring plowing and early sowing to preserve soil moisture, prevent drought, and ensure that crops mature early to avoid the harm of autumn hail and autumn frost. The people of all ethnic groups actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, breaking the usual practice of "putting away plows and driving cattle sticks" after the ninth nine-day period after the winter solstice, and generally started sowing when the ground thawed by two inches, taking the initiative to attack the drought. Warmer areas set off a spring sowing upsurge in February.

In the surprise attack on spring plowing and early sowing movement, the leading organs at the provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county levels strengthened their leadership and dispatched a large number of cadres to the front line. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 6,000 cadres from county-level and above government organs went to work at the grassroots level throughout the province. They went deep into the fields, lived, ate, and worked with the commune members, discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner, and summarized and promoted experiences in a timely manner, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and promoted spring plowing and sowing work. The Party committees at all levels paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of backward production teams, and almost every production team with a poor foundation had a working group from the higher-level Party committee stationed there to help with the work.

In the early sowing movement to preserve soil moisture, the communist spirit of advanced helping the backward and the backward catching up with the advanced spread throughout the province. Advanced production teams in the communes of Datong County all regarded supporting the spring plowing of backward teams as an obligation that should be fulfilled, and a total of more than 3,000 strong laborers were dispatched, led by team cadres, to form many shock teams to help with spring sowing in backward teams. During the most tense stage of sowing, the Qijiashan Production Team of the Nianbo Commune in Ledu County dispatched support troops four times, with nearly 100 laborers and more than 100 head of draught animals participating each time. Great collaboration and great support encouraged the backward teams' ambition to strive for advancement, and the early sowing movement to preserve soil moisture quickly unfolded throughout the province.

At present, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have transferred their main forces to the land reclamation front, taking advantage of the time before early-maturing crops are sown and field management has not yet begun to reclaim large areas of land.

    公社社员、国营农牧场职工和机关干部一齐出动
    青海全党全民向荒地大进军
    去冬今春共开荒550多万亩，力争每个劳动力扩大耕地9亩
    全省提前完成700多万亩小麦、青稞春播任务
    本报西宁13日电　青海省利用春播结束和田间管理尚未开始的空隙，全党全民向荒地大进军。北起祁连山麓、南到玉树、果洛藏族自治州，从东部农业区到阿尔太山下的阿拉尔草原，公社社员、国营农牧场职工和机关干部三路大军齐发，畜力农具和拖拉机并用。他们在荒山草原上大施威力，攻克一山又攻一滩，捷报不断传来。到4月7日，全省已新开垦荒地一百七十万亩，加上去年冬天开垦的三百八十多万亩，共已开荒五百五十多万亩。随着各地春播任务的陆续完成，还将有越来越多的人力投入开荒运动。
    青海省今年计划开荒的面积比去年全省的播种面积还大得多，平均每个农牧业劳动力要扩大耕地九亩以上。各族人民利用春播结束、田间管理工作还没有开始的时候，作为今年开荒的第一次战役，要求完成全年任务的一半以上。这个战役一开始就打得很漂亮，开荒进度之快远远超过了预计数字。全省最早完成春耕播种的民和县，由于准备工作周全，从3月1日起到3月24日，就完成了全年开荒三十万亩的任务，到4月6日已经开垦荒地四十二万多亩。在短短的三十多天中平均每个劳动力增加耕地六亩多。民和县一鼓作气完成全年开荒任务的喜报掀起了很大的波澜，各地纷纷提出“学民和、赶民和、超民和”的口号，开荒热潮正在一浪高过一浪。
    青海省各族人民开荒的决心大，干劲足，是中共青海省委的“以大量开垦荒地为主、扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量同时并举”的方针深入人心的结果。青海省现有耕地面积不大，又大部集中在东部农业区。近年来各项社会主义建设事业迅速发展，人口大量增加，对粮食的需要量越来越大。要大规模开发这里极为丰富的矿藏资源，大办工业，迅速改变青海面貌，就需要农业提供足够的粮食和原料。畜牧业的大发展，也要求大量增加饲料的生产。而青海省土质好，日照长，自然肥源丰富，特别是有着大量宜农可垦荒地，在农业发展上大有可为。因此，当省委一提出号召，就得到了各族人民的热烈响应。
    在当前声势更大的开荒运动中，国营农牧场职工和公社社员是主力军，特别是拥有一部分机械设备的农牧场，开荒地区都在辽阔平坦的草原上，负担着全部垦荒任务的60％。机关干部是开荒的一支新生力量，他们发扬延安时代精神大办机关农牧场，争取逐步做到菜、肉“两自给”，或者粮、菜、肉“三自给”。目前省、州、市、县机关干部采取专业队开荒和业余开荒相结合的办法，已经开垦荒地十二万多亩，仅省级机关就办起了一百零五个农牧场。
    共产主义大协作的风尚在开荒运动中遍及全省。各社、队除了就地开荒，还普遍组织远征队、突击队到荒地多的地方去开垦，平川地区的人们到山区去，农业区的人们到牧业区去。在征服自然的斗争中，各族人民打破县界、社界，亲如一家，都以人力、畜力、工具互相支援协作，互相照顾生活，尽量做到物尽其用，地尽其利。目前，各路开荒大军除了多开荒、快开荒以外，还力争新开荒地今春就能播种一部分，当年就有收成。
    本报西宁13日电　青海省比去年提前一个多月种完了早田作物，到4月7日，全省已播种春小麦、青 稞等粮食作物七百七十九万多亩，比去年早田和晚田作物播种的总面积还要大。在开犁最早的黄河和湟水两岸地区，麦田已经陆续出苗。
    提前播完早田是防旱抗旱运动的伟大胜利。青海去冬今春雨雪稀少，气候也较暖，春旱露头比历年早。根据这一情况，中共青海省委早在1月份就号召全省各族人民突击春耕，抢墒早播，以防旱抗旱，保证作物提前成熟，避开秋雹秋霜危害。各族人民积极响应省委号召，打破往年“九九尽，收拾犁铧赶牛棍”的常规，普遍在解冻二寸时就开始播种，主动向旱象进攻，较暖地区在2月份就掀起了春播高潮。
    在突击春耕，抢墒早播运动中，省、州、市、县各级领导机关都加强了领导，抽调了大批干部深入第一线。据不完全统计，全省县级以上机关下到基层工作的干部共达六千多人。他们深入田间，同社员同住同吃同劳动，发现问题及时解决，总结经验及时推广，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲和推动了春耕播种工作。各级党委特别注意加强对后进生产队的领导，差不多每个基础较差的生产队都驻有上级党委的工作组帮助工作。
    在抢墒早播运动中，先进帮后进、后进赶先进的共产主义协作之风遍及全省。大通县各公社的先进生产队都把支援后进队的春耕当成应尽的义务，共抽调了三千多名强壮劳力，由队的干部领导组成许多突击队，到后进队帮助春播。乐都县碾伯公社祁家山生产队在播种最紧张阶段共出动支援大军四次，每次都有近百名劳力和一百多头耕畜参加。大协作大支援鼓舞了后进队力争先进的雄心大志，使抢墒早播运动在全省范围内迅速开展。
    目前青海省各族人民已将主要力量转移到开荒战线，利用早田播完、田间管理尚未开始以前的时间大开荒地。青海省海南藏族自治州共和县铁卜加牧草试验站，在开垦过的土地上用圆盘耙平整土地。　新华社稿
