Fellow members of the presidium, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I am determined to implement them resolutely.
    1959 was a year of better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in our country following the Great Leap Forward of 1958. All fronts of socialist construction in the motherland achieved brilliant and tremendous successes. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, holding high the three red flags, deeply opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and once again created earth-shattering miracles. With vivid production practice, it once again fully demonstrated the unparalleled and enormous power of the 600 million people who liberated their minds and broke superstitions under the leadership of the Party, proving the complete correctness of the General Line. Our factory, like other factories and mines across the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees, vigorously launched mass movements and set off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production. With soaring enthusiasm and heroic steps, we fulfilled our promise, victoriously and ahead of schedule completing the annual plan for 1959, reducing the scrap rate by 0.39%, reducing costs by 14.13%, and successfully trial-producing twelve new high-end, large-scale, precision, and advanced products. We also continued to maintain a record of no major casualties for seven years, achieving a victory of overall leap forward in quantity, speed, quality, and economy, and were rated as an advanced factory in the city. The tremendous achievements made by our factory in the Great Leap Forward prove that as long as we unswervingly implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, we can overcome all difficulties on the road forward and achieve the victory of continued leap forward.

    Old Generals Have Broad Wisdom in Innovation, Young People Aspire to Be Pioneers
    Starting from the beginning of 1960, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, our factory's employees launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement to vigorously promote mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. During the Great Leap Forward, the employees of our factory, who always valued skillful work, were as happy as Sun Wukong attending the Peach Banquet, fully displaying their talents. The entire factory comprehensively and meticulously formulated a plan for technical innovation and technical revolution. All employees were spirited and high-spirited, establishing a daring and capable style, engaging in technical revolution and advanced products. The veteran workers were full of confidence, truly "heroes have not diminished their courage, old generals show wisdom in innovation." The young men were even more enthusiastic, and their slogan was: "Creation has always been the domain of the young, be pioneers on the innovation front, not afraid of failure or hardship, and not giving up until success." In this vigorous production battle, the emotions of the employees were truly high. They were busy with production tasks during the day, so they worked at night. Some workshops turned the employee club into a night shift dormitory, and the workers moved their bedding to the factory. They expressed their determination to "live in the factory, eat in the factory, and not leave the factory until technical improvement is done well." In this hot battle, many technical innovation enthusiasts emerged. Technical innovation and technical revolution have become the conscious actions of the vast number of employees striving for the high-speed construction of socialism. Under this enthusiasm, in the first quarter of this year, 919 technical reform and technical innovation suggestions were implemented, including six automatic lines and linkage lines, increasing efficiency by one to one hundred and seventeen times respectively. Not only was mechanization carried out in production, but also in living and welfare services such as canteens and nurseries. Even when holding technical transformation exhibitions, gongs and drums were mechanized with pneumatic tools. It is truly "no hands needed to strike the gong, no people seen to beat the drum, no effort needed to work, and production constantly rises."
    Take my forging workshop as an example. We modified the octagonal heating furnace, saving fuel by more than 30%. We made our own gas cutting machine, making gas cutting also mechanized. Recently, we have newly installed a bridge crane for forging materials and a turning machine, added transportation tracks, and installed an automatic device for opening and closing the furnace doors of the heating furnace. The entire workshop can be fully mechanized before May 1st.

    Innovation Becomes Newer, Efficiency Increases Higher
    I deeply realize that as a glorious people's representative, I should become a leading pioneer in this movement. Therefore, I often study with my group members on how to improve efficiency faster. In more than half a year, I have put forward more than one hundred innovation suggestions. In order to rush-produce the spring hammer, which I recently learned from Shanghai and is very beneficial to production, I did not close my eyes all night and rushed to complete the part drawings, and finally successfully trial-produced it, saving two labor forces and increasing efficiency by three times. Of course, the work I have done so far is still far from what the Party requires of me, and I need to continue to work hard and make greater contributions to the Party and socialist construction.
    In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, through technical performance competitions, "compare, learn, catch up, and help" were carried out. I want to know what others know, and I also want to know what others don't know. "Heroes are surrounded by good men, and strong generals have no weak soldiers," "one flower does not make a spring, a hundred flowers blooming is spring" has become a new fashion. My two younger brothers, Liu Ligui and Liu Lisheng, both work with me in the same workshop. Although they are brothers, everyone does not give way to each other in technical innovation and technical revolution, competing with each other enthusiastically. When forging rocker arms, I thought of a trick that allowed the task of 221 working hours to be completed in 34 hours, increasing efficiency by six and a half times. Immediately after, my second brother Liu Ligui also put forward an innovation suggestion in the next shift of forging crossheads, increasing efficiency by sixteen times. My third brother Liu Lisheng was not willing to be outdone, and put forward a suggestion for forging rivet swatters, increasing efficiency by one time. The three of us brothers compete and help each other in this way to jointly achieve our leap forward plan.
    Although the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has only been carried out for a few months, it has already borne sweet and fruitful results in production. Due to the vigorous development of the technical transformation movement, our factory completed the first quarter production plan 14 days ahead of schedule, and the output value increased by more than 50% compared with the same period last year. Achieving a good start in 1960, completely breaking the "routine" of being slack at the beginning of the year, and creating a good start for a greater leap forward this year. After vigorously promoting innovation, production has risen rapidly and output has increased significantly. For example, the creation of the research valve machine increased production efficiency by 117 times; the creation of the nut twisting machine replaced the processing of seven machine tools. Practice has proved that the Party's proposal to vigorously promote technical transformation is a powerful measure to greatly improve labor productivity and the best way to achieve high-speed development of the national economy. It has been accepted by our vast number of employees and has become our combat direction for further leap forward. As the workers said: "Technical transformation is a treasure, and doubling the leap forward depends entirely on it. As long as the mind can be enlightened, even the biggest task can be done."

    Learn Politics, Learn Technology, Improve Skills and Leap Forward
    Through this period of movement, I have also increasingly realized that I must work harder to study Mao Zedong Thought and improve my technical and cultural level. Only in this way can I successfully undertake the increasingly large construction tasks and carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement better. Once the working class grasps Marxism-Leninism and cultural and technical knowledge, it will be like a tiger with wings, generating unparalleled power. Take myself as an example. Before liberation, I was just a poor child who did not know a single character. It was only under the cultivation and education of the Party that I initially mastered some cultural knowledge. This cultural knowledge has played a significant role in my innovation today. For example, in the past, screws were tightened one by one with tools. After learning descriptive geometry, I came up with the method of the turntable tire, saving one labor force, reducing labor intensity, and improving efficiency. However, with the continued leap forward in production, I increasingly feel that what I have learned now is still too little. I am determined to actively respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, actively participate in the study of Chairman Mao's works and amateur cultural and technical studies, and further improve my ideological awareness and cultural and technical level, so as to make greater contributions to the Party's socialist construction.
    Comrades, we have now unveiled the prelude to the second quarter production battle this year. This conference has put forward new combat tasks for us and painted a magnificent blueprint for leap forward. Living in this great era of one day equaling twenty years, living in the glorious Mao Zedong era, we feel unparalleled glory. We are determined to always be promoters, hold high the three red flags, boost our energy, resolutely advance along the road pointed out by the Party, and build our beloved motherland at the fastest speed.

    提高技术水平做出色的革新闯将
    刘立富代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    1959年是我国继1958年大跃进后更好更全面继续跃进的一年，祖国社会主义建设的各个战线都获得了辉煌巨大的成就。全国人民在党中央及毛主席英明正确的领导下，高举三面红旗，深入反右倾，鼓干劲，再一次创造了惊天动地的奇迹，它以生动的生产实践，又一次充分证明了，在党的领导下六亿人民解放思想、破除迷信后的无比巨大的威力，证明了总路线的完全正确。我们工厂和全国其他厂矿一样，在党中央及省市委的正确领导下，大搞群众运动、掀起了生产大跃进的高潮，以冲天的干劲，豪迈的步伐实现了自己的诺言；提前三十二天胜利超额完成了1959年的年度计划，废品率降低0.39％，成本降低14.13％，试制成功十二种高、大、精、尖新产品，并继续保持七年来不出重大伤亡事故的成绩，取得了多快好省全面跃进的胜利，被评为市的先进工厂。我厂在大跃进中所取得的巨大成果证明：只要坚定不移地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，那么就能克服前进道路上的一切困难，获得继续跃进的胜利。
    老将革新智谋广，青年立志当尖兵
    从1960年初开始，我厂职工在省市委领导下，开展了大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的技术革新和技术革命运动。在大跃进中平素一向重视巧干的我厂职工，对于这一运动的开展正像孙悟空赶上了蟠桃宴，大显神通，心里像开了花一样高兴。全厂全面地细致地制订了技术革新和技术革命的规划，职工人人精神奋发，个个斗志昂扬，树立了敢想敢干的风格，大闹技术革命，大搞尖端产品。老工人们信心百倍，正是“英雄不减当年勇，老将革新显智谋”。年青小伙子们热情更高，他们提的口号是：“自古创造数年青，革新战线当尖兵，不怕失败不怕苦，不做成功不罢休”。在这场轰轰烈烈的生产战斗中，职工们的情绪可真高，白天生产任务忙，他们就晚上干，有的车间把职工俱乐部改成了夜班宿舍，工人们把铺盖卷搬到厂里来住。他们表示决心要“住在厂，吃在厂，不搞好技革不离厂”。在这场热火朝天的战斗中，出现了许多技术革新迷。技术革新与技术革命已经成为广大职工为高速度建设社会主义而努力的自觉的行动。在这股热情下，今年第一个季度中就实现了包括六条自动线、联动线的九百一十九项技术改革与技术革新建议，分别提高效率一倍至一百一十七倍。不仅生产上搞机械化，食堂、托儿所等生活福利事业也搞机械化，甚至于连开技术改造展览会时，敲锣打鼓也用风动工具机械化了。正是“敲锣不用手，敲鼓不见人，干活不费劲，生产不断升”。
    就拿我所在的锻工车间来说，我们改装了八角加热炉，节约燃料达到30％以上。自制了瓦斯切割机，使瓦斯切割也机械化。最近我们又新安了锻料桥式吊和翻料机，增设了运输轨道，装置了开闭加热炉炉门的自动装置，在“五一”前全车间就可以实现全盘机械化。
    革新越革越新，效率越提越高
    我自己深刻认识到作为一个光荣的人民代表，我应当在这个运动中成为一个带头的先锋。因此我就和组内的伙伴们经常研究如何才能更快的提高效率。在半年多的时间内我自己就提出了一百多件革新建议。为了赶制对生产有很大好处的新近从上海学回来的弹簧锤，我整夜没有闭眼，赶绘完了零件图，最后终于试制成功，节约了劳动力两名，提高效率三倍。当然，目前我所作的工作比起党对我的要求来说，还是很不够的，还需要继续努力，为党和社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    在大闹技术革新和技术革命中，通过技术表演赛，进行“比、学、赶、帮”，别人会的我要会，别人不会的我也要会，“英雄身边皆好汉，强将手下无弱兵”，“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”已经成为新的风尚。我的两个弟弟刘立贵、刘立盛都和我同在一个车间工作，虽然是亲兄弟，但是在搞技术革新和技术革命上大家也互不相让，互相比武，热火朝天。在锻摇把时，我想了一个窍门，使二百二十一个工时的任务三十四小时就完成了，提高效率六倍半。二弟刘立贵紧接着在下一班锻十字头也提出了革新建议，提高效率十六倍，三弟刘立盛也不甘示弱，提出了锻铆钉甩子建议提高效率一倍。我们弟兄三个就是这样互相比赛互相帮助，共同实现我们的跃进计划。
    虽然技术革新和技术革命运动的开展才不过几个月，但是它已经在生产上结下了甜美的硕果。由于技术改革运动轰轰烈烈的开展，使我厂今年一季度提前十四天完成了首季生产计划，产值比去年同期增长50％以上。实现了1960年的开门红，完全打破了过去年初松的“常规”，给今年的更大跃进创造了良好的开端。大闹革新以后，生产迅速上升，产量显著提高。例如创造了研阀机，生产效率就提高了一百一十七倍；创造了绞螺帽机，就代替了七部机床的加工。实践证明，党提出的大搞技术改革运动，是大大提高劳动生产率的有力措施，是实现国民经济高速度发展的最好途径，它已经被我们广大职工所接受，并成为我们进一步跃进的战斗方向。正如工人所说：“技术改造是个宝，跃进翻番全靠它，只要思想能开窍，再大的任务也干得了”。
    学政治学技术，提高本领阔步前进
    通过这一时期的运动，还使我越来越深刻体会到必须更努力地学习毛泽东思想，提高技术文化水平，只有这样才能胜利地担负起越来越大的建设任务，才能把技术革新与技术革命运动开展得更好。工人阶级一旦掌握了马克思列宁主义和文化技术知识，就将如猛虎生翅，产生无可比拟的力量。就拿我自己来说，解放前只是一个一字不识的穷孩子，只是在党的培养和教育下，才初步掌握了一些文化知识，这些文化知识对于我今天的搞革新起了不少的作用。例如过去打螺丝一个一个拿工具，学了画法几何以后，就想出了转盘胎的办法，节约一名劳动力，减轻劳动强度，提高了效率。不过，随着生产的继续跃进，我越来越感到现在所学的还是太少了，我决心积极响应党中央的号召，积极参加毛主席著作和业余文化技术学习，进一步提高自己的思想觉悟和文化技术水平，为党的社会主义建设事业做出更大的贡献。
    同志们，现在我们已经揭开了今年第二季度生产大战的序幕，这次大会给我们提出了新的战斗任务，给我们描绘出一幅向前跃进的宏伟的蓝图。生活在这一天等于二十年的伟大时代里，生活在光辉的毛泽东时代里，我们感到无上的光荣，我们决心永远当促进派，高举三面红旗，鼓足干劲，坚决按着党所指示的道路奋勇前进，以最快的速度建设我们亲爱的祖国。
