Lasting Friendship
The long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Indian people was well demonstrated at the World Agricultural Exposition recently held in India. The Chinese Pavilion at the exposition received more than three million people from all walks of life in India during its eighty-one days, with many visiting it more than ten times. On the final day of the closing, many visitors were still reluctant to leave.

	1. The entrance to the Chinese Pavilion. An average of 40,000 people entered the pavilion daily to visit, with a peak of 150,000 people on one day.
	2. The scene of the Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, deeply attracted the farmers who came to visit repeatedly.
	3. Indian agricultural workers are surveying and mapping the rapid harvester manufactured by the commune.
	4. The rice transplanter made in China aroused widespread interest. An agricultural worker is sketching a diagram of the rice transplanter.
	5. The high-yield cotton plant from the People's Commune is one of the most eye-catching exhibits in the exhibition hall.
	6. Farmers are particularly interested in the People's Commune. Luo Shifa, the director of the Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, introduced the development of the commune to them at a symposium.
	7. Farmers from Punjab, India, took a group photo with Chinese experts in front of the Chinese corn exhibits after visiting them. They want to sow the Chinese corn seeds on the land of Punjab so that it will bear the fruit of Sino-Indian friendship. Photo by He Xiuyin (Xinhua News Agency)

    1、中国馆的大门。每天平均有四万人由此进入馆内参观，最多的一天达十五万人
    2、河南省遂平县嵖岈山人民公社的情景深深地吸引住了几次三番地前来参观的农民
    3、印度的农业工作者正在测绘公社制造的快速收割机
    4、我国制造的播秧机，引起了人们的广泛兴趣。一个农业工作者正在描绘插秧机的图样
