Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: This reporter reports: Beijing was in an uproar today, with 600,000 people taking to the streets and marching to Tiananmen Square to hold a massive demonstration and rally, resolutely supporting the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle.

At noon today, countless teams poured in from the streets and alleys, waving flags, carrying cartoons and placards, and shouting slogans angrily as they marched towards Tiananmen Square.

It is difficult to describe the Beijing people's concern for the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. In recent days, thousands upon thousands of people have been vying to read newspapers and listen to the radio, closely watching the heroic struggle of the South Korean people. Today, they formed a powerful team of hundreds of thousands of people, and with excitement, they shouted: "Resolutely support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle!" "Resolutely oppose the US-Lee reactionary group's massacre of the South Korean people!" "Resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle!" They unanimously demanded that US imperialism immediately get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of our territory Taiwan! These deafening cries from Beijing are the cries of 650 million Chinese people.

Today's demonstration in Beijing included people from all walks of life from factories, schools, government agencies, rural areas, and urban people's communes, members of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as foreign guests invited to participate in China's "May 1st" International Labor Day celebrations.

At 11 a.m., the main streets of Beijing were crowded with people going to Tiananmen Square to attend the meeting. Many workers from beside blast furnaces and spinning machines participated in the march without even having time to take off their work clothes. Some old ladies in their fifties and sixties walked hand in hand towards Tiananmen Square. In many student teams, young people performed living dramas of South Korean people capturing American devils and the traitorous Lee Seung-man and Lee Ki-poong. When they walked through the streets, people along the way burst into laughter and applause. Students from the Central Conservatory of Music composed a large number of songs overnight, and today they marched forward singing: "Down with the traitors, drive away the American wolves, the South Korean people want liberation, the Korean people want unification... 600 million people support you, the just struggle will surely win!"

The workers of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company cheered the initial victory of the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. Some textile workers came to Tiananmen Square from factories more than a dozen miles away. They said that we used to have the same experience as the South Korean people, and US imperialism is the root of the South Korean people's suffering, and this root of evil must be removed! Zhang Yong'an, an old worker at the Beijing Automobile Factory, was separated from his wife and children and displaced during the Japanese imperialist invasion of China. When he heard that a meeting was going to be held today to support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle, he immediately put down his hammer and rushed to the meeting place. He stood excitedly at the front of the team, jumping up with both hands and shouting slogans with the people. This worker is now living a happy life, and he wrote a poem on Tiananmen Square to give to the South Korean people: "American devils are wolves with wild ambitions, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, frantically rampant. The people's uprising shouted to fight, the American devils panicked. The voice of justice shook the mountain island, Lee Seung-man was thrown into the sea!"

Hundreds of farmers came from the Qinghe People's Commune in the suburbs. They said that the Korean people are our dear brothers, and we must support them. Hou Jun, a member of this commune, said that Lee Seung-man is just like Chiang Kai-shek, he acted tyrannically and ruined people in South Korea. Now that Lee Seung-man has stepped down, but only by driving out US imperialism can the South Korean people live a happy life.

The South Korean people's struggle will surely win – this is the firm belief of the demobilized soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are covered in medals. In today's angry crowd, there was a well-organized team of all the representatives attending the National Militia Representative Conference. Wei Zhaocan, head of the militia regiment of Beifeng People's Commune in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, and a demobilized soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said that on the Korean battlefield, the US aggressor army was our defeated opponent. We resolutely support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle, and believe that the Korean people will surely drive the American robbers out of South Korea. Wang Benqing, a militia representative from Kaolao People's Commune in Jimo, Shandong, said: My two sons sacrificed on Shangganling in order to support the just struggle of the Korean people. Today, if US imperialism comes to interfere in the just struggle of the South Korean people again, I will never allow it.

The teachers and students of more than 40 universities and colleges in the capital formed a magnificent team of 40,000 people, converging on Tiananmen Square. The students of Peking University expressed their full support for the struggle of the South Korean people with excitement. Inspired by the South Korean people's struggle that shook the mountains and rivers, the students majoring in Korean in the Department of Eastern Languages wrote poems overnight to praise the heroic struggle of the South Korean people. Wherever their propaganda team went today, the song "The fire of anger is burning, the roar is shaking the sky, we must completely defeat the Lee Seung-man reactionary group, the peaceful reunification of the Korean people must be realized" resounded. More than 100 freshmen from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of Tsinghua University composed more than 200 poems supporting the struggle of the South Korean people on the train when they entered the city to attend the meeting.

The literary and art workers of the capital could not restrain their excitement. A group of art workers participated in the meeting with more than a dozen cartoons that they had rushed to draw overnight. Some poets wrote poems on the spot and recited them aloud. The poet Wang Yafan recited aloud: "Look at South Korea today, the banner of righteousness in Masan is fluttering in the wind, the people are united to rise up in struggle, and the tide of struggle is like a prairie fire...". The poet Xu Chi clenched his fists and recited passionately: "The dark days have been suffered enough, the fascist rule is coming to an end, the oppressed nation wants freedom, and the people want revenge!"

From the urban people's communes, tens of thousands of street women walked out and poured into Tiananmen Square. They said that hearing the news of the US-Lee reactionary group's massacre of the South Korean people seemed to evoke nightmares of the painful life of the past. Cui Lianyun, a female member of the Xichangan Street Commune, said that Korea is half red and half black. North Korea is heaven, and South Korea is hell. I believe that if the South Korean people persist in their struggle, the dawn is not far away.

In today's student team, there were also international students from more than 20 countries, including North Korea, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Latin America, and Africa, who volunteered to participate in the parade. The North Korean students who have been paying attention to the situation of the South Korean struggle in the past few days read newspapers, listened to the radio, and held symposiums more than once every day. Today, more than 70 North Korean students studying at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the Foreign Languages Institute stood in front of Tiananmen Square and kept shouting slogans. A large group of Chinese students across the Jinshui Bridge echoed them with slogans, continuously. The hearts of the Chinese and North Korean people are closely linked. Li Zhilin, an international student who had been to South Korea during the Korean War of Liberation, said that the heroic uprising of the South Korean people this time was the result of the brutal rule of US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group. Today, our political parties and groups have issued a joint statement, and we North Korean people must resolutely realize the demands put forward in the statement and continue to fight for the reunification of our country. Vietnamese students were very moved by the indomitable fighting spirit of the South Korean people. Yang Shen, a Vietnamese student, was particularly excited today. He used to be a resident of South Vietnam, and his father, lover, and sister were arrested and persecuted by US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary government for carrying out revolutionary activities. He said, I only have one sentence: "US imperialism get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam!" Mou Song, an African Cameroonian student, said: The Korean people are our brothers, we are fighting against US imperialism in Africa, and they are fighting against US imperialism in South Korea. The people of Asia and Africa unite to support the struggle of South Korea.

Many foreign guests participated in today's meeting. Gao Chengchun, the leader of the delegation of the Korean Central News Agency, who had just arrived in Beijing yesterday, said to the reporter with infinite excitement in the face of the vast sea of people in the square: "The roar of these 600,000 people is like a bomb that will destroy the enemy that is oppressing the South Korean people; this roar will also give the Korean people who are fighting infinite strength and courage." He said that three or four hours ago, I saw men and women, young and old, waving flags on the street and shouting the slogan "US imperialism get out of South Korea". From the bottom of my heart, I deeply felt the care and support of the Chinese people for our Korean people. The Chinese and North Korean people are truly linked heart to heart.

Just as the giant wave of struggle against the Japan-US "Security Treaty" swept across Japan, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, which was invited to visit our country, participated in today's meeting. The leader of the delegation, Akatsu Masuzo, told reporters that the grand gathering held by the Chinese people today is not only a support for the South Korean people's struggle against US imperialism, but also a support for the Japanese people who are fighting against the Japan-US "Security Treaty." I firmly believe that the Japanese people will never hand over power to the American running dog Nobusuke Kishi for a long time, and Nobusuke Kishi will also suffer the same disgraceful end as Lee Seung-man.

Friends from Africa, where the anti-colonial movement is surging, were also very moved today. Mudongbo, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Congolese Workers, said that today's meeting shows the great power of the Chinese people's solidarity in supporting the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African people. He said that unity is not an empty word. As long as the people are truly united, whether in Asia or Africa, we will eventually win the victory in the struggle against imperialism. Mudongbo said that today's meeting is not only an exciting thing that I will never forget in my life, but also a strong support for the Congolese people who are fighting against imperialism.

"We Brazilians, like the people of other countries, want the Americans to get out!" This is what Guerrero Ramos, a member of the National Committee of the Brazilian Labor Party, a professor at the Brazilian Academy of Advanced Studies, and a sociologist, said when he participated in today's meeting. He said: "The Brazilian people's struggle against US imperialism is developing rapidly. The Brazilian people are trying every means to make the Americans get out. No matter the large or small enterprises controlled by the Americans, we will tell them all to get out. The sooner they get out, the better for Brazil."

People from all walks of life in the capital, together with friends of all colors from all over the world, gathered in front of Tiananmen today. They shouted together, calling for resolute support for the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America unite and demand that the US troops get out of all their military bases! This is a powerful voice, a great unity, and this unity is invincible.

    北京发出六亿五千万中国人民的强大呼声：
    美国侵略者从南朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从南越滚出去！从我国的领土台湾滚出去！
    据新华社28日讯　本社记者报道：北京今天全城沸腾，六十万人走上街头，走向天安门广场，举行了声势浩大的示威游行和集会，坚决支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    今天中午，从大街小巷涌来无数的队伍，他们挥动着旗帜，抬着漫画和标语牌，愤怒地呼喊着口号前进，向天安门广场集中。
    很难形容北京人民对南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争的关怀心情。几天以来，千千万万的人争着看报纸，听广播，密切注视着南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。今天，他们结成数十万人的强大队伍，怀着激动的心情，高呼：“坚决支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争！”“坚决反对美李反动集团屠杀南朝鲜人民！”“坚决支援日本人民的爱国正义斗争！”他们一致要求美帝国主义立即从南朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从南越滚出去！从我国的领土台湾滚出去！北京发出的这些响彻云霄的呼声，是六亿五千万中国人民的呼声。
    今天在北京示威游行的队伍里，有来自工厂、学校、机关、农村和城市人民公社的各阶层人民，各民主党派和各人民团体成员，还有应邀参加我国“五一”国际劳动节庆祝活动的数十个国家的外宾。
    上午十一时，北京主要街道上拥挤着去天安门广场参加大会的人群。许多来自高炉旁和纺纱机旁的工人，还没有来得及脱下工作服，就参加了游行队伍。一些五六十岁的老大娘，手挽着手走向天安门广场。在许多学生的队伍里，青年们扮演了南朝鲜人民活捉美国佬和卖国贼李承晚、李起鹏的活报剧。当他们走过街头时，沿途人们发出了一片笑声和掌声。中央音乐学院的学生昨天连夜编了大批歌曲，今天他们高歌前进：“打倒卖国贼，赶走美国狼，南朝鲜人民要解放，朝鲜人民要统一。……六万万人民支持你们，正义的斗争一定胜利！”
    北京石景山钢铁公司的职工们，都为南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争的初步胜利欢呼。一些纺织女工，从十几里路以外的工厂来到天安门广场。她们说，我们过去有着同南朝鲜人民一样的遭遇，美帝国主义是南朝鲜人民痛苦的根源，必须挖掉这个祸根！北京汽车制造厂老工人张永安，在日本帝国主义侵华期间，曾经妻离子散，流离失所。他听到今天要举行支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会，立即放下锤头，赶到会场，他激动地站在队伍的最前面，举着双手跳起来和人们一起连连不断地高呼着口号。这位工人现在过着幸福的生活，他在天安门广场上作了一首诗赠给南朝鲜人民：“美国鬼子野心狼，外强中干瞎猖狂，人民起义齐喊打，美国鬼子心发慌，正义呼声震山岛，李承晚投入海中央！”
    数百农民从郊区清河人民公社赶来。他们说，朝鲜人民是我们的亲兄弟，我们一定要支援他们。这个公社的社员侯俊说，李承晚就跟蒋介石一个样，他在南朝鲜横行霸道，胡糟塌人，现在李承晚下台了，但是只有把美帝国主义赶出去，南朝鲜人民才能过幸福生活。
    南朝鲜人民的斗争一定能胜利——胸前挂满了奖章的中国人民志愿军复员军人坚信这一点。在今天愤怒的人群里，有着队伍严整的出席全国民兵代表会议的全体代表。福建省泉州市北峰人民公社民兵团团长、中国人民志愿军复员军人魏昭灿说，在朝鲜战场上，美国侵略军是我们的手下败卒，我们坚决支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，相信朝鲜人民一定能把美国强盗从南朝鲜赶出去。山东即墨栲栳人民公社民兵代表王本清说：我两个儿子就是为了支援朝鲜人民正义斗争，牺牲在上甘岭。今天，美帝国主义再来干涉南朝鲜人民的正义斗争，我绝不容许。
    首都四十多个高等学校的师生，今天组成了一支四万人的雄壮队伍，浩浩荡荡向天安门广场汇集。北京大学的学生们，以激动的心情表示全力支援南朝鲜人民的斗争。东语系朝鲜语专业的学生们，为南朝鲜人民震撼山河的斗争所鼓舞，连夜赶写出诗歌，歌颂南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，今天他们这支宣传队伍走到那里，那里就响起“怒火燃烧，吼声震天，要彻底打垮李承晚反动集团，朝鲜人民和平统一一定要实现”的歌声。清华大学水利系一年级的一百多名学生进城参加大会时，在列车上就创作了支持南朝鲜人民斗争的诗歌二百多首。
    首都文艺工作者，抑制不住他们激动的心情。一群美术工作者带着他们连夜赶画出来的十多幅漫画参加大会。一些诗人当场写下诗篇高声朗诵。诗人王亚凡高声朗诵：“请看今日的南朝鲜，马山义旗迎风漫卷，万众一心起来斗争，斗争怒潮如火燎原……。”诗人徐迟握紧拳头激昂的朗诵道：“黑暗日子已受够，法西斯统治要到头，被压迫民族要自由，人民要复仇！”
    从城市人民公社里，走出了成千上万的街道妇女，涌向天安门广场。她们说，听到美李反动集团屠杀南朝鲜人民的消息，好似勾起了旧日痛苦生活的恶梦。西长安街公社的女社员崔连云说，朝鲜是红半边，黑半边。北朝鲜是天堂，南朝鲜是地狱。我相信南朝鲜人民坚持斗争下去，离天亮就不远了。
    在今天的学生队伍里，还有自愿来参加游行的朝鲜、苏联、越南、拉丁美洲、非洲等二十多个国家的留学生。几天来一直关注着南朝鲜斗争局势的朝鲜留学生，他们每天读报、听广播、不止一次地开座谈会，今天七十多名在北京大学、清华大学、外国语学院学习的朝鲜留学生，站在天安门前，不停地高呼口号，隔着金水桥的一大群中国学生，和他们用口号一呼一应，连续不断。中朝两国人民的心紧紧的连在一起了。曾经在朝鲜解放战争时期到过南朝鲜的留学生李址麟说，南朝鲜人民这次的英勇起义是美帝国主义和李承晚集团残酷统治的结果。今天我国各政党团体已经发表联合声明，我们朝鲜人民要坚决实现声明中提出的要求，继续为实现祖国的统一而斗争。越南留学生对于南朝鲜人民不屈不挠的斗争精神十分感动，越南留学生杨慎，今天的心情特别激动，他原来是南越的居民，父亲、爱人、妹妹都因为进行革命活动而遭受美帝国主义和吴庭艳反动政府的逮捕和迫害。他说，我只有一句话：“美帝国主义从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！”非洲喀麦隆留学生茂松说：朝鲜人民是我们的兄弟，我们在非洲向美帝展开斗争，他们在南朝鲜向美帝进行斗争。亚非人民都团结起来，支援南朝鲜的斗争。
    许多国家的外宾参加了今天的大会。昨天刚刚到达北京的朝鲜中央通讯社代表团团长高成淳对着广场上浩瀚的人海，无限激动地对记者说：“这六十万人的怒吼声像一颗炸弹一样，要把那压在南朝鲜人民头上的敌人炸毁；这吼声也会使正在斗争着的朝鲜人民增加无限的力量和勇气。”他说，在三、四个小时以前，我看到大街上不分男女老少，都挥舞着旗子，高呼着“美帝国主义从南朝鲜滚出去”的口号，我从内心深深感觉到中国人民对我们朝鲜人民的关怀和支持，中朝两国人民真是心心相连。
    正当反对日美“安全条约”的斗争巨浪席卷日本全国的时候，应邀来我国访问的日中友好协会代表团参加了今天的大会，团长赤津益造对记者说，中国人民今天举行这样盛大的集会，不仅是对南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义斗争的支持，而且是对正在进行反对日美“安全条约”斗争的日本人民的支持。我深深相信，日本人民决不会长期把政权交给美国走狗岸信介，岸信介也会像李承晚一样遭到可耻的下场。
    来自反殖民主义运动高涨的非洲朋友们，今天也很受感动。刚果工人全国联合会总书记穆东伯说，今天这个大会显示了中国人民支持亚非人民反对帝国主义斗争团结的巨大力量。他说，团结，这不是一个空泛的字眼，只要人民真正团结起来了，不管在亚洲或是非洲，我们最终是会取得对帝国主义斗争的胜利的。穆东伯说，今天这个大会不仅是我一生难忘的激动的事情，而且对于正在进行反帝斗争的刚果人民也是一个有力的支持。
    “我们巴西人民也同其他国家的人民一样，要美国佬滚回去！”这是参加今天大会的巴西工党全国委员会委员、巴西高级研究学院教授，社会学家格雷罗·雷摩斯说的话。他说：“巴西人民反对美帝国主义的斗争发展很快。巴西人民正在千方百计使美国佬滚回去，不管美国佬控制的大小企业，一概都叫他们滚，越快滚出去，巴西越好。”
    首都各阶层人民，同来自世界各国有着各种肤色的朋友们，今天汇集在天安门前，他们一起高呼，号召坚决支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民联合起来，要求美国军队从它的所有军事基地滚出去！这是一个强大的声音，是一个伟大的团结，这种团结是无敌的。
