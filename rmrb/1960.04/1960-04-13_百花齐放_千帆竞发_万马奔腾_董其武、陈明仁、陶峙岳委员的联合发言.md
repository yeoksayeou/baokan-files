Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, a Thousand Sails Race, Ten Thousand Horses Gallop
Joint Speech by Committee Members Dong Qiwu, Chen Mingren, and Tao Zhiyue

Mr. Chairman, Fellow Committee Members:

We fully agree with and enthusiastically support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and we are determined to implement them resolutely in our future practical work.

Now, let me talk about our main feelings and experiences.

Since 1958, China's socialist construction has entered a new historical period. The three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune during the socialist construction period have demonstrated unparalleled and tremendous power, creating countless epoch-making miracles. What we have seen and heard from the troops, or from inspections, everywhere impresses us: the people of the whole country are in high spirits and full of energy, the construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, changing with each passing day, truly a hundred flowers blooming, a thousand sails racing, and ten thousand horses galloping. What our ancestors dared not imagine and could not do has become a reality today. This is a great victory for the Chinese people, a great victory for the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. With boundless excitement, we warmly hail this great victory.

From our personal experiences, ten years ago, under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, we raised the banner of righteousness and welcomed the great liberation of the people of the whole country and our own liberation with resolute patriotic actions. Over the past ten years, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, we have carried out self-transformation, participated in and defended the cause of socialist construction, and contributed our strength to the motherland. We increasingly feel the fullness of our lives and have gained strength from the infinitely rich source of Mao Zedong Thought. "Earnestly studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future." We must earnestly remember this truth. To this end, from now on, we must first seize the time to earnestly study and painstakingly delve into Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, and establish a proletarian world outlook and outlook on life; second, we must consciously participate in labor training, frequently go deep into reality, humbly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, cultivate the habit of loving labor, and enhance the mass viewpoint and the ideological feelings of workers, peasants, and laboring people. Through labor training, we will accelerate ideological transformation; third, we must regularly and diligently study and take the lead in implementing the various policies and policies of the Party and the government; conduct propaganda and education to the masses at any time, and transform the various policies and policies of the Party and the government into our own and the practical actions of the broad masses of the people; fourth, we must actively strive to participate in various mass movements, and in the raging fire of mass movements, transform ourselves and improve ourselves. We believe that only by using the method of integrating theory with practice, and the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, consciously and continuously carrying out ideological revolution, so that our thinking can be thoroughly transformed, can we adapt to the development of the objective leap forward situation, and can we better serve the people, socialism, and the cause of communist construction.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "China's general line for socialist construction has extremely rich content. Its starting point is: the masses of the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. The masses of the people, liberated from the old society, become masters under the socialist system, and can give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, so that production and construction can develop at a high speed." In our actual life, there are countless such facts. For example, in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there is an 83-year-old man named Ma Xincai. In the decades before liberation, he lived a life worse than cattle and horses. In the ten years after liberation, he worked diligently as a master, constantly reclaiming land, farming, raising pigs, and raising chickens. In the beginning, he only raised three chickens, but in 1959 he developed to more than 3,000, and will continue to develop in the future. Last year, someone asked him how old he was, and he said, "I am only ten years old." It turned out that he regarded the year of liberation as his birth year. Now, from the relationships between people, everywhere you can see the new social atmosphere and moral standards of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, picking up difficulties, and giving way to convenience, truly "the situation is infinitely good, and the hearts of the people are red." This is the result of strengthening political and ideological education and putting politics in command in all work.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft budget for 1960 powerfully shows that our budget is a peaceful budget and a budget for the overall leap forward of socialist construction. This year, China's economic and cultural construction funds account for 81.9% of the entire budget expenditure, while defense expenditures only account for 8.3%. This ratio powerfully demonstrates the great desire of the Chinese people to devote themselves wholeheartedly to peaceful construction, which forms a strong contrast with the arms expansion and war preparations budget of US imperialism. At the same time, this report also vividly reveals the characteristics of financial work in the new period of socialist construction: more income, more expenditure, more construction; more income, more expenditure, more construction, taken from the people, used for the people. We recall the financial situation during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which can be summarized as: more exploitation, more embezzlement, more destruction; more exploitation, more embezzlement, more destruction. Taken from the people, enriching oneself. Comparing the past and the present, it is indeed a sharp contrast between different systems and different natures of political power. This fact illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. In military work, we must, on the basis of strengthening economic construction, strive to strengthen national defense construction, work harder, and be a loyal defender of socialism. At the same time, we are also a loyal builder of socialism.

Finally, we must be very vigilant to note that: while there is a sea of red across the mainland of the country, US imperialists still occupy our Taiwan, and we must continue to persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad and strive for the liberation of Taiwan.

    百花齐放  千帆竞发  万马奔腾
    董其武、陈明仁、陶峙岳委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全同意和热诚拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，并坚决在今后的实际工作中贯彻执行。
    下面谈谈我们主要的感受和体会。
    从1958年开始，我国社会主义建设进入了一个新的历史时期。总路线、大跃进、人民公社这个社会主义建设时期的三大法宝，显示了无比巨大的威力，这就创造出划时代的无数奇迹。我们从部队中，或是从视察中，所见所闻，到处给我们的印象是：全国人民意气风发，干劲冲天，建设事业突飞猛进，日新月异，真是百花齐放，千帆竞发，万马奔腾。我们的先人所不敢设想的事情和作不到的事情，在今天都变成了现实。这是中国人民的伟大胜利，这是马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们以无限兴奋的心情，热烈欢呼这个伟大的胜利。
    从我们个人的经历来说，十年前，我们在毛泽东的思想感召下，高举义旗，用坚决的爱国行动，迎接了全国人民的大解放和自身的解放。十年来，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，进行自我改造，参加和捍卫社会主义建设事业，对祖国贡献了自己的力量。我们愈来愈感到自己生命的充实，从毛泽东思想这个无比丰富的源泉中得到了力量。“认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证”。——我们一定要认真地记取这个真理。为此，从今以后，我们首先要抓紧时间，认真学习、刻苦钻研马克思列宁主义毛泽东著作，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，确立无产阶级的世界观和人生观；其次，要自觉地参加劳动锻炼，经常地深入实际，虚心地向工农兵学习，养成热爱劳动的习惯，增强群众观点和工农劳动人民的思想感情。通过劳动锻炼，加快思想改造；第三，要经常努力地学习并带头贯彻执行党和政府的各项方针政策；随时向群众进行宣传教育，使党和政府的各项方针政策变成我们自己的和广大人民群众的实际行动；第四，要积极争取参加各项群众运动，并在群众运动的烈火中，改造自己，提高自己。我们认为，只有用理论联系实际的方法，和批评与自我批评的武器，自觉地不断地进行思想革命，使我们的思想得到彻底的改造，才能适应客观跃进形势的发展，才能更好地为人民、为社会主义和共产主义建设事业服务。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“我国社会主义建设总路线有着极丰富的内容。它的出发点是：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。人民群众从旧社会解放出来，在社会主义制度下成为主人，就能够充分发挥积极性和创造性，使生产建设得到高速度的发展。”这在我们的实际生活中，就有无数这样的事实。例如：新疆生产建设兵团，有一位八十三岁高龄的老人，名叫马新才，解放前的几十年中，他一直过着牛马不如的生活；解放后十年来，他以主人翁的姿态，勤勤恳恳，手脚不停地开荒种地，养猪养鸡。开始他只养了三只鸡，1959年发展到三千多只，今后还将继续发展。去年有人问他多少岁了，他说：“我才十岁”。原来他是把解放之年当作自己的生年的。现在从人与人的关系中，到处都可以看到学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进，拾困难、让方便种种新的社会风气和道德标准，真是“形势无限好，人心一片红”。这是在一切工作中，加强政治思想教育，政治挂帅的结果。
    李先念副总理关于1960年预算草案的报告，有力地表明，我们的预算是一个和平的预算，是一个社会主义建设事业全面跃进的预算。今年我国经济文化建设资金占整个预算支出的81.9％，而国防费只占8.3％。这个比例数有力地表明了我国人民全心全力从事和平建设的伟大愿望，这与美帝国主义扩军备战的预算形成了强烈的对比。同时，这个报告还生动地揭示出社会主义建设新时期中财政工作的特点：多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设，取之于民，用之于民。我们回想在国民党反动派统治时期财政的情况，那可以概括为：多压榨，多中饱，多破坏；更多地压榨，更多地中饱，更多地破坏。取之于民，肥诸于己。今昔对比，实在是制度不同，政权性质不同的尖锐对照。这个事实说明了社会主义制度无比的优越性。在军队工作中，我们一定要在加强经济建设的基础上，努力加强国防建设，以更大的干劲，做一个忠实的社会主义的保卫者。同时，又是一个忠实的社会主义的建设者。
    最后，我们一定要十分警惕地注意到：在全国大陆上是一片红光，但是美帝国主义者还霸占着我国的台湾，还须继续坚持对国内外敌人的斗争，为解放台湾而努力。
