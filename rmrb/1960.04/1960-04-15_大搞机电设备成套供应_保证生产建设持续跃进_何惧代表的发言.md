Vigorously Promote Complete Supply of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment to Ensure Continuous Leap Forward in Production and Construction
Speech by Representative He Ju

Mr. Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and sincerely support the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the "Report on the Draft State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as other reports, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in future work.

　　Equipment Completeness is a Major Matter

I am engaged in the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment. Now I will report to the conference on the situation and some experiences in organizing the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment over the past year, and please give your comments and corrections.

China's machinery industry, like other fronts of the national economy, is developing rapidly under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious light of the Party's General Line. 1959, following the Great Leap Forward of 1958, achieved another extraordinary leap forward. The output of many major products has increased several times, and the quality has generally improved. More importantly, various high-end, large-scale, precision, and advanced technical equipment urgently needed in national economic construction, which previously relied mainly on imports, can now be produced by ourselves or have been produced in batches. For example, large-scale power generation equipment, large-scale forging equipment, large-scale blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and steel rolling equipment have all been produced in batches. The main complete sets of equipment needed in China's national economic construction have shifted from mainly relying on foreign supply to mainly relying on domestic supply, and the technical level of China's machinery industry has advanced to a new stage.

Under the situation of the overall Great Leap Forward in China's national economic development, tens of thousands of capital construction projects are started every year, and thousands upon thousands of industrial and mining enterprises are completed and put into production every year. They urgently require the mechanical industry sector to provide more, better, and newer technical equipment, and require the technical equipment to be supplied completely to ensure that construction projects are completed and put into production quickly. Equipment completeness sounds like a very familiar term, but its content is very complex. For example, a complete set of equipment for a 50,000-kilowatt thermal power plant, in addition to the three main engines of turbine, turbine generator, and boiler, requires 144 types of auxiliary machines and accessories, with more than 5,000 units, or more than 48,000 pieces if calculated by original parts; a steel complex requires tens of thousands of units of equipment, with equipment weighing hundreds of thousands of tons. The complete set of equipment for a factory, due to its large quantity and variety, cannot be manufactured by a few factories. It often requires hundreds or thousands of factories to manufacture separately. Then, how to centrally reflect the equipment demand, arrange production in complete sets, and organize supply in complete sets for the tens of thousands of complete sets of equipment required for thousands upon thousands of construction projects is a very arduous and complex task.

In its January 20, 1959, instruction on the "Report on Strengthening Equipment Completeness Work" by the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Party Central Committee wisely pointed out: "Equipment completeness is a complex task, and it has become a decisive link in whether new enterprises in our country can be put into production quickly."

The leaders of our First Ministry of Machine Building, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's instructions and relevant guidelines and policies on strengthening equipment completeness work, established the "First Ministry of Machine Building Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Complete Set Supply Corporation." Under the leadership and support of the Party committees, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have also established 27 provincial, municipal, and autonomous region companies accordingly (Tibet Autonomous Region has not yet been established). After a year of work practice, it has been proven that the Party Central Committee's instructions and relevant guidelines and policies on strengthening equipment completeness work are completely correct.

The equipment completeness supply work in 1959, under the glorious light of the General Line, and under the leadership and care of Party committees at all levels, with the Great Leap Forward on all fronts of the country, the organization of equipment completeness supply work has also achieved remarkable results, victoriously completing the task of organizing the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment in 1959 assigned to us by the Party and the state, and played a certain role in the early and overfulfillment of the state capital construction plan.

Beginning in March 1959, the State Construction Commission handed over to the Complete Set Corporation the complete supply tasks of one thousand several hundred new construction projects and finishing projects, and also handed over the task of supplying more than thirteen thousand single machines.

The one thousand several hundred construction projects included several hundred major projects with investment limits and above from the perspective of construction scale, such as the huge projects of Baotou Iron and Steel Complex and Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex; from the perspective of the departments to which the projects belong, they involved 19 departments of the central government, including both directly affiliated projects of the central government and local construction projects. These projects were distributed in 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country.

　　Outstanding Achievements in Completeness Work in 1959

Last year, our company was newly established. Under the circumstances of incomplete organization, lack of cadres, and lack of work experience, the task was very urgent and arduous.

Under the leadership and support of Party committees and departments at all levels, and inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we adhered to putting politics in command, launched a mass movement, and through the arrangement of equipment production departments, we signed contracts with mechanical production enterprises across the country to deliver a total of tens of thousands of pieces of equipment in 1959. After going deep into the production enterprises to understand the production situation, assisting in solving difficulties in production, urging the delivery of equipment, and contacting transportation, with the strong support of the production enterprises, we tried every means to overcome many difficulties, so that the delivery rate last year was as high as over 90%. Therefore, of the one thousand several hundred construction projects, in addition to the several hundred projects for organizing the complete supply of equipment handed over by the State Construction Commission in November last year, which should not be calculated in the task of supplying equipment in 1959 because they only started ordering at the first ordering meeting in 1960, more than six hundred of the remaining several hundred construction projects have been fully or partially completed and put into production. This has provided a new force for the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, especially for the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1960. For example, in the coal industry system, 57 pairs of mine shafts have been put into production, newly adding tens of millions of tons of coal mining capacity per year; in the textile industry system, tens of thousands of spindles have been newly added. In other industries and transportation systems, a certain amount of new production capacity has also been added. In particular, the early and overfulfillment of the complete supply task of dozens of sets of large and medium-sized rolling mills and millions of kilowatts of power generation equipment is of great significance to the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy. While completing the complete supply task of dozens of sets of large and medium-sized rolling mills ahead of schedule, we also completed the complete supply task of several hundred sets of small and medium-sized rolling mills transferred from 1958 to 1959 for continued production. The steel production capacity of only dozens of sets of large and medium-sized rolling mills is equivalent to more than half of the actual steel output of the country in 1958. Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the station complete set task (including a part of the main engine imported from abroad and domestic completeness) greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the staff and workers of the machinery industry and the cadres of the Complete Set Corporation. For example, if the original task is 100, the actual completion exceeded 70%, which is 1.72 times the total power generation capacity built in the old China during the 68 years from 1882 to 1949 during the reactionary rule, which is 77% higher than the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

In addition to the above achievements, the Complete Set Companies in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also organized the complete supply tasks for a large number of construction projects delivered by the leaders of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 items have been partially or fully completed and put into production in the complete equipment supply projects organized by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions themselves.

The achievements in organizing the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment are due to the leadership of the Party, the strong support of various departments, and the result of adhering to putting politics in command and launching a mass movement. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the entire staff and workers of the machinery industry have been full of revolutionary spirit and have launched a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Under the call of the Party Central Committee of "Contracts Must Not Be Carried Over to the New Year," production has increased sharply, and the number of complete sets of equipment delivered has doubled every ten days and every month. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party also brought infinite new strength to the cadres of the Complete Set Corporation. The communist style of cooperation among brother companies across the country has been greatly developed, and a competition movement has been launched to deliver goods first and benefit others later, to ensure the timely completion of the external transfer of equipment; the right-leaning conservative thinking of waiting for delivery and believing that they are powerless to solve the difficulties existing in production enterprises has been overcome in a timely manner; a new style of actively grasping production and trying every means to assist production enterprises in overcoming difficulties has been universally established; and a new atmosphere of mutual support and mutual assistance has emerged. All of this is the fundamental guarantee for the successful completion of the task of organizing the complete supply of equipment in 1959.

　　Experience in One Year of Actual Work

After one year of actual work, we have the following experiences:

1. Organizing the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment is more conducive to implementing the basic construction policy of concentrating forces, ensuring key points, building in batches, first simple and then complete, and combining foreign and local methods.

With the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, tens of thousands of projects are started every year. Although the production of national mechanical equipment has made great leaps forward year by year, it still cannot fully meet the needs of national construction. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the basic construction policy of concentrating forces, ensuring key points, building in batches, first simple and then complete, and combining foreign and local methods in the use of mechanical equipment. The projects for which the Complete Set Corporation is responsible for organizing the complete supply are proposed by the competent departments according to the urgency of putting them into production, and are reviewed and approved in batches by the State Planning Commission and the State Construction Commission, or the planning and construction committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. This selects key points from a large number of construction projects.

Since the projects for which the complete set of equipment is supplied are the key points in national construction, the state gives priority to considering the equipment needs of the complete projects in terms of both the balanced distribution of equipment and the complete arrangement of production plans, as well as the specific production and delivery of production enterprises.

The State Construction Commission or the construction commissions of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, according to the construction progress and the principle of urgency of various types of complete projects handed over to the Complete Set Corporation for operation, make a ranking of the order of delivery. The Complete Set Companies across the country order and ship goods according to this ranking order, so that the complete equipment required for each project can be supplied in order, quickly completed, and put into production.

Even so, the design of a capital construction project should have everything. Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in China's capital construction, although the machinery industry has developed rapidly, it is still insufficient compared with the national need for equipment. Therefore, it is difficult to supply a complete set of equipment according to the designed equipment demand for each construction project at one time. How to overcome this difficulty? Our experience is: on the one hand, develop equipment manufacturing capacity faster and increase production; on the other hand, save as much as possible in the use of equipment. Experience has proved that the methods of simplifying as much as possible, first simple and then complete, replacing as much as possible, replacing foreign with local, combining foreign and local, and going from local to foreign can save a lot of equipment. For example, if the complete set of equipment required for a power station is equipped according to the requirements of simple production, about 30% (calculated by the number of units) of the equipment can be postponed. In this way, the same amount of equipment can put more construction projects into production as soon as possible. This is a way to ensure that capital construction is more, faster, better, and more economical, and it is conducive to the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

2. Adopting equipment sub-delivery can not only centrally reflect needs, which is conducive to national comprehensive balance, but also enable various production and supply departments to rationally divide labor, which is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties.

The mechanical and electrical equipment required for each capital construction project is diverse and complex. By making equipment sub-delivery according to the equipment list of the capital construction design, we can more accurately and timely reflect the overall situation of the equipment required for national key construction projects. This provides more reliable data for the national planning department and the production planning department, which is conducive to comprehensive balance, timely discovery of problems, and adoption of measures to overcome weak links.

Since the equipment list of the equipment complete supply project is complete, specific, and also the key needs of the state, the production plan can be arranged in complete sets and is easy to implement.

As mentioned earlier, a complete project requires thousands upon thousands of units of equipment, including large equipment weighing dozens or even hundreds of tons per unit, as well as small products such as light bulbs, high-end, large-scale, precision, and advanced equipment, as well as simple and sporadic equipment, including both standard products and non-standard equipment. If all these numerous and complex equipment are handed over to one department for production and one unit for supply, this is unrealistic, uneconomical, and unreasonable. Experience has proved that it is necessary to make a reasonable division of labor according to the equipment list in the design for the equipment required for a project. For example, the main equipment that is uniformly distributed and uniformly planned by the state is uniformly organized and supplied by the Complete Set Corporation; non-standard equipment that is simple to manufacture, bulky, and inconvenient for long-distance transportation is manufactured on-site by the construction unit or entrusted to local processing and manufacturing; equipment operated by the commercial department is organized and supplied by the local commercial department; some equipment that is not yet produced domestically and needs to be imported from abroad is applied for by the construction unit to the relevant state departments for import and supply; some equipment that is suitable for the construction unit or the competent department to apply for distribution according to the state distribution system is solved by self-application.

Many examples last year proved that such equipment sub-delivery (i.e., division of labor) is reasonable. It makes the division of labor clear, well-informed, consistent from top to bottom, and mobilizes the enthusiasm of all parties to jointly complete the complete task for the various equipment required for each project.

3. With an organization for the complete supply of equipment, it can greatly save equipment supply staff, improve equipment supply work, and is conducive to production.

Due to the great development of national capital construction and the great development of mechanical industry production, the equipment that needs to be produced is increasing and the types are becoming more and more complex. Precisely because of this, the mechanical and electrical equipment ordering meetings that connect needs and production have become larger and larger, and have developed from the previous two or three thousand people to tens of thousands of people, and the meeting period has become longer and longer. A capital construction project requires thousands upon thousands of units of mechanical and electrical equipment. In the past, because there were fewer national capital construction projects, it was still feasible for construction units to send batches of equipment procurement personnel to run around the country to purchase, order, and urge delivery. However, if large-scale construction is carried out today and the old methods are still used, I am afraid that the difficulties will increase day by day, and it will also bring waste in manpower and material resources. Due to the establishment of the Complete Set Companies all over the country, through our one year of specific practical experience, it has become possible to gradually change the working methods of equipment ordering, supply, and urging delivery. On the basis of a relatively implemented production plan, it is possible to place orders locally according to the location of the production enterprise. Because the Complete Set Corporation has formed a unified supply network across the country. There was once an experience in local ordering in the third and fourth quarters of 1959. Even if the centralized ordering is still carried out in Beijing, ordering through the Complete Set Corporation can also greatly reduce the number of ordering personnel. For example, at the first ordering meeting in 1960, the Complete Set Corporation undertook the ordering task of more than 1,000 complete projects and thousands of "small foreign groups," and the equipment ordered accounted for about one-third of the total ordering volume of the conference, but the company's participants in the ordering were only 300 people, while the total number of people at the conference was more than 8,000, which fully illustrates the superiority of the Complete Set Corporation that is uniformly organized for equipment ordering. Therefore, we believe that with the continuous development of the organization of the complete supply of equipment and the gradual enrichment of work experience, it is possible to gradually reduce the number of people concentrated in Beijing for ordering and shorten the ordering time, and it may be possible to change this large-scale centralized ordering method in the future. Not only that, because the Complete Set Corporation is established by province, municipality, and autonomous region, it has close ties with the machinery industry bureaus or production plants, and understands the production situation more specifically. Through the regular contact system between the company and the construction unit, the production situation can be notified to the company and the construction unit in a timely manner, which changes the current phenomenon that thousands upon thousands of equipment supply personnel run all over the country to urge and demand goods. For enterprises producing equipment, it not only reduces the number of ordering units, but also solves the difficulty of receiving a large number of delivery personnel. Since the ordering and delivery of complete sets of equipment are ranked, the production plan can be compiled according to the order of delivery, so that the plan can be more stable, which is conducive to improving productivity.

4. The leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command and launching a mass movement are the guarantees for achieving complete victory.

The achievements in organizing the complete supply of equipment in 1959 are the result of the leadership of the Party at all levels, the strong support of various departments, the hard work of the staff and workers of the national machinery industry, and the active hard work and practical work of all comrades in the Complete Set Corporation system. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the movement to oppose right-leaning, encourage vigor, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, the fighters on the machinery industry production front enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party, were full of revolutionary spirit, and the production of mechanical and electrical equipment rose linearly, and the delivery volume of complete sets of equipment also rose several times. For example, the amount of equipment that the Shaanxi Provincial Company needed to transfer in from other provinces in the third quarter only reached 34% of the amount that should have been delivered, and the equipment self-made in the province only reached 14%, while the amount of delivery from both inside and outside the province in the fourth quarter completed 95% of the amount that should have been delivered throughout the year. The amount of equipment transferred in by Henan Provincial Company from other provinces in September was 1,010 units, which is equivalent to the total amount transferred in from May to August, and the amount of external transfer in September also increased by 2.2 times compared with August. These iron facts fully illustrate the great power of the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command. Another example is the first complete set of equipment ordering in 1960. Under the organization and leadership of the National Mechanical and Electrical Products Ordering Conference, political and ideological work was strengthened, various companies established an overall view, and the equipment transferred in and out was grasped together, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and mobilizing the positive factors of all comrades. In the case of short time, few people, and heavy tasks, nearly 190,000 pieces of equipment contracts were signed for only the first and second batches of complete projects. The number of units of equipment ordered accounted for 98% of the total distribution number, which is unprecedentedly high. This also shows that under the leadership of the Party, with the strong support of various relevant departments, adhering to putting politics in command, and launching a mass movement, we will be invincible.

　　New Tasks for Completeness Work in 1960

The "Report on the National Economic Plan for 1960" reported by Vice Premier Li Fuchun is a magnificent plan for continuous Great Leap Forward. The scale of capital construction is larger and the number of projects is greater than in 1959, so the number of projects for which the complete supply of equipment needs to be organized will be greater. The task of our Complete Set Corporation will be more huge and glorious.

The production plan indicators of the machinery industry in 1960 are also continuous Great Leap Forward indicators. There will be more and more high-end, large-scale, precision, and advanced products, and the variety will also increase greatly. Some weak links will be strengthened. This will create favorable conditions for organizing the complete supply of equipment.

The development of the Complete Set Corporation in the past year, due to the leadership of the Party at all levels and the help and support of various parties, and the joint efforts of all comrades, the organization has been established and gradually improved, the number of personnel has increased, and certain experience has been gained in work. Therefore, we have the possibility to further improve our work level and complete the task of organizing the complete supply of equipment assigned to us by the Party and the state more, faster, better, and more economically.

We must abide by the instructions put forward by Vice Premier Li Fuchun in the report, "Taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, combining the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture; we should continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link in industry and grain as the key link in agriculture, and make overall arrangements, and further strengthen transportation, power industry, mining industry, and other departments; in order to more appropriately handle the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, and between all industries and trades within each department, so that the national economy can leap forward better," and do a good job in the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment.

We must continue to implement the state capital construction policy of concentrating forces, ensuring key points, building in batches, first simple and then complete, and combining foreign and local methods through equipment sub-delivery. Taking the complete set as the key link and grasping the execution of supply contracts as the center, we will go deep into various production enterprises to grasp production, promote production, and help production, so that all supply contracts can be delivered on time or ahead of schedule. At the same time, we must go deep into various construction units to understand the construction progress, and timely organize the delivery of equipment according to the delivery order arranged by the State Construction Commission, so that the project can be completed on schedule and put into production in a timely manner.

We must persistently study Chairman Mao's works, intensify self-transformation, constantly improve class consciousness, overcome the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and commandist styles in our work, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought, and in the spirit of continuous revolution, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in our work, improve our work, and improve our ideological level and business level, and be good cadres of Chairman Mao who are both red and expert.

We must, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhere to putting politics in command, organize the Complete Set Companies across the country to launch a mass competition movement to ensure that contracts do not expire, try every means to help production, and cooperate with the complete projects to start production on schedule, and conduct evaluations with the equipment transferred out by each company as the center, advocate giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to ourselves, so that the communist style of mutual support and mutual assistance can be further developed.

The task of complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment in 1960 is very arduous and glorious. We do not have much experience, our level is not high, and there are still many difficulties in our work; but difficulties are afraid of revolutionary vigor, we have the leadership of the Party, and we have the glorious light of the General Line. Therefore, we have the confidence and determination to overcome all difficulties, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought, vigorously promote the complete supply of mechanical and electrical equipment, and strive to ensure the continuous Great Leap Forward in production and construction.

专栏：

    大搞机电设备成套供应　保证生产建设持续跃进
    何惧代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”以及其他各项报告，并保证在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
      设备配套是件大事
    我是做机电设备成套供应工作的，现将一年来组织机电设备成套供应工作的情况和一些体会向大会汇报，并请各位代表指正。
    我国的机械工业和国民经济的其它各个战线一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，正在飞跃地发展。1959年继大跃进的1958年之后，又获得了特大的跃进。许多主要产品的产量成倍地增长着，质量也普遍地提高了，更重要的是国民经济建设中迫切需要而以往主要是依靠国外进口的各种高、大、精、尖的技术设备，现在我们自己已能生产或已成批地生产。如大型发电设备、大型锻压设备、大型高炉、平炉以及轧钢等设备都已成批成套的生产了。我国国民经济建设中需要的主要成套设备，已由依靠国外供应为主转变为国内供应为主，我国机械工业的技术水平已迈进到一个新的阶段。
    在我国国民经济建设全面大跃进的形势下，每年有几万个基建项目动工兴建，每年有成千上万个工矿企业建成并投入生产，它们迫切要求机械工业部门提供更多、更好、更新的技术装备，要求技术装备配齐成套的供应，以保证建设工程迅速建成投入生产。设备成套听来是一个很熟悉的名词，但是它的内容十分复杂。例如：一个五万瓩火力发电站的一套设备，除汽轮机、汽轮发电机、锅炉三大主机外，需要的辅机和配件达一百四十四种，五千多台件，如以原件计算则有四万八千多件；一个钢铁联合企业所需设备有几万台件，设备重量达几十万吨。一个工厂的成套设备，由于数量大，种类多，不可能由少数几个工厂来制造，往往要由上百成千的工厂分工制造，那末成千上万的建设工程所需成千上万套成套设备，如何集中反映设备需要量、成套地安排生产、成套地组织供应，是一件十分艰巨十分复杂的工作。
    党中央1959年1月20日对第一机械工业部“关于加强设备成套工作的报告”的批示中，英明的指出：“设备成套是一件复杂工作，它已经成为目前我国新建企业能否迅速投入生产的一个决定性的环节”。
    我们第一机械工业部的领导上遵照党中央关于加强设备成套工作的指示和有关方针政策，设立了“第一机械工业部机电设备成套总公司”，全国各省、市、自治区在党委的领导和支持下也相应地设立了二十七个省、市、自治区公司（西藏自治区尚未设立），经过一年来的工作实践证明，党中央对加强设备成套工作的指示和有关方针政策是完全正确的。
    1959年的设备成套供应工作，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在各级党委的领导和关怀下，随着全国各个战线上的大跃进，组织设备成套供应工作也取得了显著的成绩，胜利地完成了党和国家所交给我们的1959年的组织机电设备成套供应任务，对国家基本建设计划的提前和超额完成，起了一定的作用。
    1959年3月开始，国家建设委员会分批交给成套公司一千几百个新建项目和收尾工程的成套供应任务，同时还交给了一万三千多台单机配套的任务。
    一千几百个建设项目，从建设规模来看有限额以上的重大项目几百项，如包头钢铁联合企业、武汉钢铁联合企业等巨大工程；从项目的隶属部门来看，涉及中央十九个部门，既有中央直属项目，又有地方建设项目，这些项目分布在全国二十八个省、市、自治区。
      一九五九年配套工作成绩出色
    去年我们公司刚刚设立，在机构不健全、干部缺少，又缺乏工作经验的情况下，任务是十分紧迫和繁重的。
    我们在各级党委和各部门的领导与支持下，在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，通过设备生产部门的安排，在去年一年中，我们与全国各机械生产企业签订在1959年应交付的设备共十几万台件。经过深入生产企业摸生产情况，协助解决生产中的困难，催交设备、联系运输，在生产企业的大力支持下，千方百计的克服许多困难，使去年的交货率高达90％以上。因此，一千几百个建设项目，除了去年11月国家建委交给的几百个组织成套供应设备的项目，因系在1960年第一次订货会议中方开始订货，不应计算在1959年供应设备任务外，其余几百个建设项目，已有六百多个项目全部或部分建成并投入生产。这对国民经济的大跃进，特别是对1960年的持续大跃进，提供了新的生力军。如在煤炭工业系统中，有五十七对矿井已经投入生产，新增加了年产几千万吨的采煤能力，在纺织工业系统中，新增了几十万纺锭，其他各个工业、交通运输系统中，也增加了一定的新的生产能力。特别是提前和超额完成了几十套大中型轧钢机和几百万瓩发电设备的成套供应任务，对国民经济的持续大跃进有着重要的意义。在提前完成几十套大中型轧钢机的成套供应任务的同时，还完成了1958年结转1959年继续生产的几百套中小型轧钢机的成套供应任务。仅几十套大中型轧钢机的钢材生产能力就相当于全国1958年实际钢材产量的一半以上。电站成套任务（包括一部分由国外进口主机，国内配套）在党的八届八中全会的号召下，大大鼓舞了机械工业职工和成套公司干部的积极性，如以原订任务为一百，实际完成超额70％以上，为反动统治时期的旧中国，从1882年到1949年的六十八年间所建全部发电能力的一点七二倍，比大跃进的1958年还高77％。
    除了上述成绩外，各省、市、自治区成套公司还组织了省、市、自治区领导所交付的大量建设项目的成套供应任务。据不完全的统计，在省、市、自治区自行组织的成套供应设备项目中，有三百多项已部分或全部建成并投入生产。
    组织机电设备成套供应工作成绩的获得，是由于党的领导、各部门的大力支持，坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。自从党的八届八中全会以后，机械工业的全体职工，鼓足了革命干劲，掀起了增产节约的新高潮，在党中央的“合同不过年”的号召下，生产急剧增长，成套设备的交货数量，逐旬、逐月的成倍上升。党的八届八中全会，也给成套公司的干部带来了无穷的新力量。全国各兄弟公司之间，共产主义的协作风格大大发扬，展开了在交货上先人后己，保证及时完成外调设备的竞赛运动；及时克服了坐等交货，认为对生产企业存在的困难无能为力的右倾保守思想；普遍树立了积极抓生产、千方百计协助生产企业克服困难的新作风；出现了彼此支援、互相协助的新风气。这一切，是胜利完成1959年组织设备成套供应任务的根本保证。
    一年实际工作中的体会
    经过一年的实际工作，我们有以下一些体会：
    一、组织机电设备成套供应，更有利于贯彻集中力量、保证重点、分批建设、先简后全、洋土结合的基本建设方针。
    国民经济的大跃进，每年有几万个项目动工兴建，国家机械设备的生产，虽然逐年有着巨大的跃进，但尚不能完全适应国家建设的需要。因此，必须在使用机械设备上贯彻集中力量、保证重点、分批建设、先简后全、洋土结合的基建方针。成套公司负责组织成套供应的项目，是由各主管部门按照要求投入生产的缓急提出的，经由国家计委和建委，或省、市、自治区计委、建委分批审定，这就在大量建设项目中选出了重点。
    由于成套供应设备的项目是国家建设中的重点，因而国家无论在设备的平衡分配和生产计划的成套安排上，以及生产企业在具体生产、交货等方面都给予优先考虑，这就对成套项目的设备需要提供了保证。
    国家建委或省、市、自治区建委，根据交给成套公司经营的各类成套项目的建设进度和重重急急的原则，作出交货先后次序的排队，全国各成套公司根据这一排队次序订货与发货，这就使各个项目所需的成套设备能按次序得到供应，迅速建成，投入生产。
    虽然如此，但一个基建项目的设计是应有尽有的，由于我国基本建设持续大跃进，机械工业虽然发展很快，但与国家需要设备来比，仍有不足之处。因此每一建设项目如按设计规定的设备需要量一次全套供应是有困难的。如何克服这个困难？我们的体验是：一方面更快地发展设备制造能力，增加生产；另一方面，在使用设备上尽量节约。经验证明，能简即简，先简后全，能代即代，以土代洋，洋土结合，由土到洋的办法，是可以节约大量的设备的。例如一个电站所需的全套设备，如果按简易投产要求配备设备，约可暂缓供应30％（按台件计算）的设备。这样做，以同样数量的设备，就可以使更多的建设项目及早投入生产。这是保证基本建设多、快、好、省的做法，有利于国民经济的持续大跃进。
    二、采用设备分交，既能集中反映需要，有利于国家综合平衡，又能使各生产、供应部门合理分工，有利于发动各方面的积极性。
    每个基建项目所需的机电设备是多样而复杂的，通过按照基建设计的设备清单作设备分交，就可以比较正确的、及时的反映国家重点建设项目所需设备的全面情况，这就对国家计划部门和生产计划部门提供了较为可靠的资料，有利于综合平衡，及时发现问题，采取措施，克服薄弱环节。
    由于成套供应设备项目的设备清单是成套的，具体的，而且又是国家的重点需要，因而生产计划既可以成套安排又便于落实。
    正如前面所说，一个成套项目所需的设备有成千上万台件，有每台重几十吨甚至几百吨的大设备，也有像电灯泡一类的小产品，有高、大、精、尖的设备，也有简单零星的设备，既有标准产品，也有非标准设备。如果把这众多复杂的设备，全部交由一个部门生产，一个单位来供应，这是不现实的，也是不经济、不合理的。经验证明，把一个项目所需设备，按照设计中的设备清单，作合理的分工是必要的。例如属于国家统一分配统一计划生产的主要设备，由成套公司统一组织供应；属于制造简单、体积庞大不便长途运输的非标准设备，由建设单位在现场制造或就地委托加工制造；属于商业部门经营的设备由当地商业部门组织供应；某些国内暂时还没有生产，需要由国外进口的设备，由建设单位提请国家有关部门进口供应；某些按照国家分配制度的规定，适于由建设单位或主管部门自行申请分配的设备，即自行申请解决。
    去年许多实例证明，这样的设备分交（即分工）是合理的，它使每一个项目所需各种设备，分工明确、心中有数、上下一致，发动了各方面的积极性，共同完成成套任务。
    三、有了组织设备成套供应机构，可以大大节约设备供应工作人员，改进设备供应工作，有利于生产。
    由于国家基本建设的大发展，机械工业生产的大发展，需要与生产的设备越来越多，种类越来越复杂。正因为如此，联接需要与生产的机电设备订货会议，也就越开越大，已由以往的二三千人发展到上万人，而且会期也越来越长。一个建设项目需要的机电设备成千上万台，以往因国家建设项目较少，由建设单位派出成批设备采购人员，几乎跑遍全国进行采购订货催交的办法尚属可行，而今大规模进行建设，仍用老办法，恐困难会日多，而且带来人力、物力上的浪费。由于遍布全国的成套公司的设立，经过我们一年来具体实践的体会，逐步改变设备订货、供货、催交等工作办法已经有了可能。在生产计划比较落实的基础上，可以按生产企业所在地，就地进行订货。因为成套公司在全国已形成一个统一的供应网。1959年三、四季度就曾经有过一次地方订货的经验，即使仍是在北京进行集中订货，通过成套公司订货，也可以大大减少订货人员。例如1960年的第一次订货会议，成套公司担负着一千多成套项目和几千个“小洋群”的订货任务，所订设备占大会总订货量的三分之一左右，但公司参加订货人员仅三百人，而大会总人数约有八千多人，这就充分说明了设备订货通过统一组织起来的成套公司的优越性。因此我们相信，随着组织设备成套供应工作的不断发展，工作经验的逐渐丰富，有可能逐步减少集中在北京订货的人数并缩短订货的时间，将来也有可能改变这种大集中订货的方式。不仅如此，由于成套公司是按省、市、自治区设立的，它与机械工业厅局或生产厂有着密切联系，了解生产情况比较具体，通过公司之间和基建单位之间的经常联系制度，能把生产情况及时的通知需要设备的公司和建设单位，这就改变了目前成千上万个设备供应人员奔走全国去催货要货的现象。对生产设备的企业来说，既减少了众多的订货单位，又解决了接待众多催货人员的困难，并由于成套设备订货、交货是有排队次序的，生产计划可按照交货次序编制，从而计划可以较为稳定，有利于提高生产率。
    四、党的领导，坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动是取得配套胜利的保证。
    1959年组织设备成套供应工作成绩的取得是各级党的领导，各部门的大力支持，全国机械工业职工的奋战，以及成套公司系统全体同志的积极苦干、实干加巧干的结果。自党八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约运动以后，机械工业生产战线上的战士们热烈响应党的号召，鼓足了革命干劲，机电设备生产直线上升，成套设备的交货量也成倍的上升。例如：陕西省公司需外省调入的设备，三季到货量仅达到应交货量的34％，省内自制的设备只到货14％，而四季度省内外的交货量就完成了全年应交货的95％，河南省公司9月份由外省调入了一千零十台设备，相当于5至8月调入量的总和，外调量9月份比8月份亦增长二点二倍。这些铁的事实，充分说明了党的领导、政治挂帅的巨大力量。又如1960年第一次成套设备订货，在全国机电产品订货会议的组织领导下，加强了政治思想工作，各公司树立了全局观点，对调入调出设备都一齐抓起来，充分发动了群众，调动了全体同志的积极因素，在时间短，人员少，任务重的情况下，仅第一、二批成套项目就签订了近十九万台件设备合同，所订设备的台件数占总分配数的98％，这样高的比率，是从未有过的。这又说明了，在党的领导下，各有关部门的大力支持，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，就无往而不胜。
      一九六○年配套工作的新任务
    李富春副总理所报告的“关于1960年国民经济计划”，是一个宏伟的持续大跃进的计划，基本建设的规模比1959年更大，项目更多，因而要组织设备成套供应的项目就会更多。我们成套公司的任务将更为巨大而光荣。
    1960年机械工业的生产计划指标也是一个持续大跃进的指标，高、大、精、尖的产品会越来越多，品种也会大量增加，某些薄弱环节会得到加强。这就给组织设备成套供应工作创造了有利的条件。
    成套公司一年来的发展，由于各级党的领导和各方面的帮助和支持，全体同志们的共同努力，机构已建立和逐步健全，人员增多了，工作上已取得了一定的经验，因而我们有可能进一步提高我们的工作水平，更多、更快、更好、更省地完成党和国家交给我们的组织设备成套供应的任务。
    我们一定遵照李富春副总理在报告中提出的“以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合；应当继续执行工业以钢为纲，农业以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，并且进一步加强运输业、动力工业、采掘工业等部门；以便更加适当地处理重工业、轻工业、农业各部门之间及各部门内各行各业之间的关系，使国民经济跃进得更好”的指示，做好机电设备成套供应工作。
    我们要继续通过设备分交，贯彻集中力量，保证重点，分批建设，先简后全，洋土结合的国家基本建设方针。以成套为纲，以抓执行供应合同为中心，深入各生产企业，进行抓生产，促生产，帮生产，使所有供货合同能按期或提前交货。同时我们要深入各建设单位，了解建设进度，按照国家建委排定的交货次序，及时组织交付设备，使项目按期建成及时投入生产。
    我们要坚持不懈地学习毛主席著作，加紧进行自我改造，不断提高阶级觉悟，克服工作中的官僚主义、主观主义、命令主义的作风，高举毛泽东的思想红旗，本着不断革命论的精神，在工作中进行技术革新，技术革命，改进我们的工作，提高我们的思想水平和业务水平，做一个又红又专的毛主席的好干部。
    我们要在各级党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，组织全国各成套公司，开展一个保证合同不过期，千方百计帮助生产，配合成套项目按期开工生产的群众竞赛运动，以各公司调出设备为中心，进行评比，提倡把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己，使彼此支援，互相帮助的共产主义风格进一步得到发扬。
    1960年的机电设备成套供应的任务是十分繁重而光荣的，我们的经验还不多，我们的水平还不高，工作中还有许多困难；但困难怕革命干劲，我们有党的领导，有总路线的光辉照耀，因此，我们有信心、有决心能够克服一切困难，高举着毛泽东的思想红旗，大搞机电设备成套供应，为保证生产建设持续大跃进而奋斗。
