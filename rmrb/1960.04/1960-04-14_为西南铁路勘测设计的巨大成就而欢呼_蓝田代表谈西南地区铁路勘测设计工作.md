I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the draft State Budget for 1960, and other reports at this conference. Now, I will report to the conference on the railway survey and design work in the Southwest region since the First Session of the Second National People's Congress.

In 1959, the Southwest Region Completed Survey and Design Tasks Equivalent to Over 6,000 Kilometers.

In 1959, all staff members of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, who were engaged in railway survey and design work in the Southwest region of the motherland, together with the people of the whole country, under the correct leadership of the Party, held high the red banner of the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, and with soaring revolutionary spirit, achieved even greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Over the past year, surveys and designs have been carried out on more than one hundred railway trunk lines, branch lines, and dedicated lines in the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan in Southwest China, as well as parts of Hubei, Shaanxi, and Guangxi provinces. Because the Party's instructions of "grasping tightly from the beginning, grasping tightly step by step, and grasping tightly from beginning to end" were conscientiously implemented from the beginning of the year, 57% of the annual planned tasks were completed in the first half of the year, breaking the old convention of slackening first and tightening later in survey and design in the past, and creating favorable conditions for realizing a greater leap forward throughout the year. In particular, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great call for launching the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers, after thoroughly opposing right-leaning and boosting their energy, launched a new upsurge of the movement for increasing production and practicing economy with high quality and high output. This upsurge developed wave upon wave, each wave higher than the last, surging forward, dispelling the erroneous trend of right-leaning opportunism, and production rose steadily, leaping forward again and again. The entire institute victoriously completed the annual planned tasks forty-three days ahead of schedule. In 1959, a total of 6,274 equivalent kilometers of line survey and design were completed in the Southwest region, accounting for 125.5% of the annual plan; 2,204 kilometers of line construction design were completed, accounting for 128.6% of the annual plan. The actual workload completed throughout the year increased by 39% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Not only were the design documents for the annual construction line projects completed, ensuring the needs of construction, but also a certain amount of survey and design data were reserved for future construction lines. This has greatly changed the situation in the past where design lagged behind construction for a long time. Now, even if there are urgent construction projects, the design documents can be provided in time to meet the requirements of construction by adopting measures of designing and constructing at the same time. Over the past two years, the speed of survey and design work has not only been greatly accelerated, but also the quality has been significantly improved. The main manifestation is that the standards of railway lines have been continuously improved and raised according to the needs of the sustained leap forward development of the national economy. The main trunk lines have adopted the standards of electrification and dieselization for powerful traction in survey and design. For some main trunk lines connecting the national political and economic centers, double-track designs have also been made at one time, which greatly improves the transportation capacity of the railway trunk lines. Due to the extensive and in-depth development of mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, survey and design methods have also been greatly improved. Advanced operating methods and advanced tools have continued to emerge, greatly reducing the heavy physical labor. Field surveys are gradually developing in the direction of rapid, lightweight, and automation, and interior design is moving towards calculation graphing, instrumentation, electrification, map compilation, typesetting, printing, design comprehensive finalization, and design industrialization. Labor productivity has been continuously improved, and production costs have been continuously reduced. In 1959, the average labor productivity of survey and design increased by 13% compared with 1958, while the actual expenditure of survey and design fees for the whole year was reduced by more than 25% compared with the budget, comprehensively achieving the goals of high quality, high output, low consumption, and high efficiency, and winning a comprehensive leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Launch Mass Movements, Combine Railway Insiders and Outsiders, and Combine Three Aspects Within the Railway

The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 is a great victory for the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought. Through the practice of continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, we have gained rich experience, and the most important and fundamental experience is to firmly rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and launch mass movements.

First, adhering to the general line of socialist construction, opposing right-leaning, boosting energy, and launching the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, various right-leaning emotions and right-leaning ideas have been exposed and criticized, the revolutionary energy has been boosted more and more, and the enthusiasm for production has continued to rise. After completing the task ahead of schedule in 1959, we have achieved the victory of continuing the leap forward at the beginning of this year. In the past three months, we have achieved red every month and completed the first quarter's task ahead of schedule. Ideologically, the erroneous viewpoints and ideas of detachment from politics, detachment from reality, and subjectivity and one-sidedness in the past have been criticized and overcome. The vast majority of technicians have clarified ideologically that survey and design work must rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the wisdom of the masses, resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs, and build both ocean railways and small ocean and small native railways; build roads with both steel rails and iron rails; adopt both high standards and medium and low standards. In this way, the railway lines surveyed and designed can meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development and accelerate the speed of railway construction.

Second, under the guidance of the Party's policy of running railways by the whole Party and the whole people, we launched a mass line selection movement in survey and design. Under the leadership of the local Party committees, we vigorously carried out communist cooperation, implemented the four combinations of railway insiders and outsiders (i.e., the combination of local Party and government leaders, railway survey and design departments, relevant industrial and mining construction units, and the broad masses of local people) and the two three combinations within the railway (the three combinations of leaders, workers, and technicians in railway survey and design itself, and the three combinations of design, construction, and user departments in railway construction). This enabled the survey and design work to better implement the Party's policies and policies, so that the selected lines not only meet the requirements of the country, but also meet the needs of local industrial and agricultural development, and greatly accelerated the speed, improved the quality, and saved investment. Due to the development of mass line selection movement, we basically clarified the natural conditions and economic conditions of the Southwest region in a short period of time, collected a lot of useful information, and compiled the survey and design plan of the railway network in the Southwest region on this basis, creating favorable conditions for accelerating railway survey and design work in the future. Now this method of vigorously carrying out mass movements has been extended from line selection work to all important links in the railway survey and design process, thus making the survey and design work appear a new situation.

Third, in the past two years, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, under the leadership of the Party and the promotion of the Great Leap Forward in production, the broad masses of workers have eliminated superstitions, emancipated their minds, and the communist style of daring to think and dare to do has been further developed. Not only has there been significant innovation in survey and design methods, greatly reducing heavy physical labor and improving labor productivity, but also because of continuous summarizing and promoting advanced experience, studying new technologies, and carrying out scientific research, breakthroughs have been made in key production links, and the technical level of survey and design has also been significantly improved compared with the past. Now we have basically mastered the new technologies of electrification, dieselization, and modern communication signal design. Some projects that could not be designed in the past can now be designed. For example, we are designing long tunnels of ten to twenty kilometers, and we have achieved preliminary results in the design of high piers and large-span bridges of about 100 meters. We have also accumulated rich experience in line survey and design in areas with poor geological conditions. Now the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of railway survey and design is vigorously moving forward in depth. Many single innovation results are rapidly forming a complete set. The reform focusing on survey and design methods is entering the reform focusing on design content, and continuously reforming design content is moving towards the goals of high, large, precise, sharp, and new.

Fourth, under the guidance of the idea of the whole country as one chess game, through the development of the socialist competition of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," the communist spirit of mutual help and mutual cooperation has been further developed, and the relationship between people and people, between collectives and collectives, and between insiders and outsiders has become closer and closer. In the work, we create favorable conditions for each other. Railway survey and design departments and other relevant construction units exchange information and use each other's data. "Leaving the difficulties to ourselves and bringing convenience to others" has become a new characteristic of people's relationships. Leaders care about production, care about the masses, often go deep into the front line, go deep into the grassroots, direct production, participate in labor, and share weal and woe with the masses, which further stimulates the production enthusiasm of the masses. This new production relationship effectively promotes the continuous leap forward of production.

The practice of continuous leap forward in the past two years has given us rich experience and found methods and ways for the high-quality, high-output, and high-speed development of railway survey and design. It can be expected that in 1960, on the basis of continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959, we will achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. In this new year, with the high-speed development of the national economy, there will be more new railways built than in any previous year, and the task of railway survey and design is still very heavy, but it is also very glorious. All the railway survey and design workers in our Southwest region will hold high the red banner of the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, and with the spirit of continuous revolution, establish lofty aspirations, set great ambitions, and forge ahead courageously. On the basis of the victory of achieving a red start in the first quarter, we will resolutely strive to complete this year's tasks ahead of schedule and over fulfill them, and provide high-quality design documents as soon as possible, and strive to build a railway network in the Southwest region as soon as possible that is accessible in all directions and closely connected with all parts of the motherland.

    为西南铁路勘测设计的巨大成就而欢呼
    蓝田代表谈西南地区铁路勘测设计工作
    我完全同意并拥护这次大会上李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和其他报告。现在我把二届一次大会以来，西南地区铁路勘测设计的情况向大会作如下汇报。
    1959年西南地区完成了六千多折合公里的勘测设计任务
    1959年，在祖国西南地区进行铁路勘测设计工作的铁道部第二设计院全体职工和全国人民一道，在党的正确领导下，高举总路线、毛泽东思想的红旗，以冲天的革命干劲，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了更大、更好、更全面的跃进。一年来，在西南云、贵、川三省以及湖北、陕西、广西等省的部分地区，共进行了一百多条铁路干线、支线和专用线的勘测设计。由于年初一开始就认真贯彻执行了党的“从头抓紧，步步抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的指示，上半年就完成了全年计划任务的57％，打破了勘测设计过去历年来前松后紧的旧常规，为实现全年更大跃进创造了有利条件。特别是党的八届八中全会发布关于开展增产节约运动的伟大号召以后，广大职工在党的领导下，经过深入地反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起了热火朝天的优质高产的增产节约运动的新高潮。这个高潮一浪接着一浪，一浪高过一浪，汹涌澎湃地向前发展，驱散了右倾机会主义的歪风邪气，生产节节上升，一跃再跃，全院提前四十三天胜利地完成了全年计划任务。1959年在西南地区共完成线路勘测设计六千二百七十四折合公里，为年度计划的125.5％；完成线路施工设计二千二百零四公里，为年度计划的128.6％。全年完成的实际工作量较之大跃进的1958年还增长39％，不仅完成了年度施工线路项目的设计文件，保证了施工的需要，并还为以后施工的线路储备了一定数量的勘测和设计资料。这样，就大大改变了过去长期以来设计赶不上施工的局面。现在即使遇到有紧急施工的项目，采取边设计边施工的措施，也能及时提供设计文件满足建设的要求。两年来勘测设计工作不仅大大加快了速度，而且质量也显著提高，主要表现在铁路线路标准根据国民经济持续跃进发展的需要已不断地改善和提高，主要干线上采用了电气化、内燃化等强力牵引的标准进行勘测设计，对一些联系国家政治经济中心的主要干线还一次做出复线设计，这就大大提高了铁路干线的运输能力。由于广泛深入地开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，勘测设计方法也大大改进了，先进操作方法和先进工具不断地出现，大大减轻了繁重的体力劳动，外业勘测正逐步向快速、轻便、自动化的方向发展，内业设计正在由计算图表化、仪器化、电气化、制图活版拼装化、印刷化、设计综合定型化、设计工厂化前进，劳动生产率不断提高，生产成本不断降低。1959年勘测设计平均劳动生产率即较1958年提高13％，而全年勘测设计费用的实际开支则较预算降低了25％以上，全面实现了优质、高产、低耗、高效的奋斗目标，赢得了多快好省的全面大跃进。
    大搞群众运动，铁路内外四结合，铁路内部三结合
    1958年和1959年连续大跃进是总路线、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。通过两年来连续大跃进的实践，我们取得了丰富的经验，而最主要的最根本的经验就是：坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。
    一、坚持社会主义建设总路线，反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动，广大职工政治觉悟大大提高，揭发和批判了各种右倾情绪和右倾思想，革命干劲愈鼓愈足，生产热情不断高涨。1959年提前超额完成任务之后，今年又取得继续跃进开门红的胜利。三个月来，做到了月月红，提前超额完成了第一季度任务。在思想上，批判和克服了过去脱离政治、脱离实际、主观片面的错误观点和思想，绝大多数技术人员都从思想上明确了：勘测设计工作必须依靠党的领导，依靠群众的智慧，坚决贯彻两条腿走路的方针，既要建设大洋铁路，又要建设小洋、小土铁路；既要用钢轨修路，又要用铁轨修路；既要采用高标准，又要采用中、低标准。这样，才能使勘测设计的铁路线路，适应工农业发展的需要，加快铁路建设的速度。
    二、在党所提出的全党全民办铁路的方针指导下，我们在勘测设计中开展了大搞群众选线运动。在各地党委的领导下，大搞共产主义协作，实行铁路内外四结合（即：地方党政领导、铁路勘测设计部门、有关工矿建设单位和地方广大群众的四结合）和铁路内部两个三结合（铁路勘测设计本身领导、工人群众、技术人员三结合和铁路建设中设计、施工与使用部门的三结合）的群众性选线，使勘测设计工作更好地贯彻了党的方针政策，使选出的线路既满足了国家的要求又能适应地方工农业发展的需要，并且大大加快了速度，提高了质量，节约了投资。由于开展群众选线运动，使我们在短短的时间内基本上摸清了西南地区的自然条件和经济情况，收集到了许多有用的资料，并在此基础上编制了西南地区铁路网的勘测设计规划，为加速今后铁路勘测设计工作创造了有利条件。现在这种大搞群众运动的方法，已经由选线工作推广运用到铁路勘测设计过程中的各个重要环节，因而使勘测设计工作出现了一个崭新的局面。
    三、两年来，在大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，广大职工在党的领导和生产大跃进的推动下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，敢想、敢做的共产主义风格得到了进一步发扬。不仅在勘测设计方法上有了显著的革新，大大减轻了繁重的体力劳动，提高了劳动生产率，而且由于不断总结和推广先进经验，钻研新技术和开展科学研究，不断突破了生产关键，勘测设计技术水平也比以往有了显著的提高。现在已基本上掌握了电气化、内燃化和现代化的通信信号设计新技术，一些过去不能设计的项目，现在已经能够设计了。如正在进行十至二十公里的长隧道设计，对一百米左右高墩、大跨的桥梁设计，也取得了初步成果，对地质不良地段的线路勘测设计也积累了丰富的经验。现在铁路勘测设计的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在蓬勃地向前深入发展，许多单项的革新成果正在迅速配套成龙，由勘测设计方法为重点的改革进入以设计内容为重点的改革，不断改革设计内容向高、大、精、尖、新的目标迈进。
    四、在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，通过“学、比、赶、帮”社会主义竞赛的开展，互相帮助，互相协作的共产主义精神得到了进一步发扬，人与人之间，集体与集体间，内内外外的关系愈来愈密切。在工作中互相为对方创造有利条件，铁路勘测设计部门与其他有关建设单位，互通有无，互相利用资料，“把困难留给自己，把方便带给别人”已经成为人们关系中的一个新的特色。领导关心生产，关心群众，经常深入第一线，深入最基层，指挥生产，参加劳动，与群众同甘共苦，更加激发了群众的生产积极性。这种新的生产关系；有力地促进了生产持续向前跃进。
    两年来连续跃进的实践，使我们取得了丰富的经验，找到了铁路勘测设计优质高产高速度发展的方法和途径，可以预期1960年又将在1959年继续大跃进的基础上，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。在这新的一年中，随着国民经济的高速度发展，新建铁路比以往任何一年都多得多，铁路勘测设计的任务仍然是十分繁重的，但也是十分光荣的。我们西南地区全体铁路勘测设计职工更将高举总路线、毛泽东思想的红旗，以不断革命的精神，树雄心，立大志，勇往直前，在已经实现一季度开门红的胜利基础上，坚决为提前超额完成今年的任务而奋斗，尽快地提供出优质的设计文件，为使西南地区及早建成四通八达与祖国各地紧密相连的铁路网而奋斗。
