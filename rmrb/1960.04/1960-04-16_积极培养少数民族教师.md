Actively Cultivate Minority Teachers
　　Zu Nian
Xinjiang Normal College has adopted a method of focusing on in-service training and supplementing it with full-time training, enabling Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz teachers to independently teach courses in higher education institutions with the help of Han teachers and their own efforts. Eighty-eight teachers have already achieved this, which is encouraging news.

With the development of minority education, actively cultivating minority teachers has become a crucial issue. In recent years, a large number of minority teachers for primary and secondary schools have been trained through the establishment of ethnic normal schools and short-term training courses, but minority teachers are still very scarce in minority higher education institutions. In the future, in addition to continuing to run ethnic normal schools well, it is particularly important to further organize Han teachers to help minority teachers in minority higher education institutions. This is because the majority of students in these schools are from ethnic minorities; on the other hand, due to language barriers, Han teachers need to go through translation when lecturing, which doubles the teaching time. Currently, many professional courses cannot be fully translated due to a lack of translation talent, which is bound to affect the quality of teaching. At the same time, minority teachers understand the characteristics of their own ethnic groups and the psychology of students best. If they can independently conduct teaching, the effect will definitely be greater. The Party Committee of Xinjiang Normal College, based on these circumstances, has listed the cultivation of minority teachers as the central task of the Party Committee and actively organized Han teachers to help minority teachers. As a result, in a very short period of time, minority teachers not only mastered teaching skills and improved their professional knowledge in various subjects, but also became able to teach independently. This not only solved the difficulties of language barriers and understanding of ethnic characteristics in Han teachers' teaching, but more importantly, it also cultivated minority teachers. This fact shows that only by actively cultivating and improving minority teachers can the ranks of minority teachers grow stronger day by day, and the continuous leap forward of minority education will have a solid foundation.

It is the unshirkable responsibility and a glorious political task for Han teachers to help minority teachers to undertake teaching work as soon as possible; minority teachers should also exert revolutionary energy, study hard, and become outstanding teachers in the education work of their own ethnic groups. Under the leadership of the Party, with the joint efforts of Han teachers and minority teachers, we will draw the most beautiful picture of minority education on the blank sheet of "poverty and blankness."

    积极培养少数民族教师	祖年
    新疆师范学院采取在职进修为主，脱产进修为辅的办法，使维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜等民族教师，在汉族教师的帮助和他们自己的努力下，已有八十八名能够在高等学校独立开课，这是可喜的消息。
    随着少数民族教育事业的发展，积极培养少数民族教师，已经成为一个关键问题。几年来，举办民族师范学校和短期训练班，培养了大批中、小学的民族教师，但在少数民族高等学校里，民族教师仍然是非常缺乏的。今后，除了继续办好民族师范学校外，特别是在少数民族的高等学校里，要进一步组织汉族教师帮助少数民族教师。这是因为在这些学校里，学生绝大部分是少数民族；另一方面，因语言不通，汉族教师讲课要通过翻译，结果授课时间增加一倍，而目前许多专业课，因翻译人才缺乏，内容又不能完整地翻译出来，势必影响教学质量；同时，少数民族教师，最了解自己民族特点和学生的心理，如果他们能独立进行教学，效果定会更大。新疆师范学院党委，从这些情况出发，把培养少数民族教师列为党委的中心工作，并积极地组织汉族教师帮助少数民族教师。结果，在很短时间内，少数民族教师不仅掌握教学业务，提高各科专业知识水平，并且能独立地教学。这样，既解决了汉族教师教学中语言困难和民族特点的理解等困难，更重要的是又培养了少数民族教师。这个事实表明，只有积极培养和提高少数民族教师，少数民族教师的队伍才能日益壮大，少数民族教育事业持续跃进才有了坚实的基础。
    汉族教师帮助少数民族教师使他们尽快地担负起教学工作，这是义不容辞的责任，也是一项光荣的政治任务；少数民族教师也要发挥革命的干劲，努力学习，使自己成为本民族教育工作中的优秀教师。在党的领导下，在汉族教师和少数民族教师的共同努力下，我们将在“一穷二白”的白纸上画出少数民族教育事业的最美好的图画来。
