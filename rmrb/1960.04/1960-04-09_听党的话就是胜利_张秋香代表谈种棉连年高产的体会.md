Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I am determined to implement them resolutely. Now, I would like to report to the conference on the work of the cotton cultivation team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province.

In recent years, under the close care and guidance of Party and government leaders at all levels, our cotton experimental fields have achieved an average yield of over 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu for five consecutive years. Especially in 1959, after the start of summer, we encountered a severe drought, the worst in thirty years, and were seriously threatened by natural disasters such as wind, hail, diseases, and pests. Thanks to the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, relying on the enormous power of the People's Commune, and fully leveraging the soaring revolutionary spirit of all team members, we flexibly implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, adapting to local conditions and timing, overcame the disasters, and still achieved high cotton yields. In 1959, we planted 9.492 mu of high-yield cotton experimental fields, with an average yield of 1,587.3 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, 1.13 mu averaged 1,843.6 jin of seed cotton per mu, nearly ten times higher than the local average yield. All of this is due to the correct leadership of Party and government at all levels, the resolute implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the active support of the broad masses, and the efforts of all team members. It is also a victory for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement. Why have our cotton crops yielded high for consecutive years? I believe the main reasons are as follows:

One, it is essential to listen to the Party. Listening to the Communist Party is never wrong, and following Chairman Mao leads to victory. This is our personal experience since liberation. It was because the Party publicized the importance of high cotton yields that we thought of the high-yield cotton experimental fields. In the past few years, in our cotton cultivation, the Party has helped us solve many difficulties, continuously educated us, improved our thinking, and pointed out the direction for us. It should be particularly emphasized that our process of achieving victory is a process of carrying out the struggle between the two roads. After the summer harvest in 1959, some wealthy middle peasants in the countryside took advantage of loopholes in our work, seized upon minor problems that had already been overcome, and amplified them to attack our high-yield experimental fields. Some said, "Running high-yield cotton experimental fields requires too much labor and investment, and it's not worth it," "So many people are always in the field all day long to work on so little cotton, it's just wasting time!" They slandered the cotton experimental fields as "foreign factories." When the cotton suffered from a major wind disaster, some wealthy middle peasants said, "This time, Qiuxiang's satellite has been blown into the ground." When striving to retain more autumn bolls, some wealthy middle peasants said, "Establishing the commune is a waste of effort," "Autumn bolls have too many damaged flowers, and there is no gain in increasing production;" during the drought resistance effort, wealthy middle peasants said, "This year's drought is too severe, human power cannot resist it, and there is no guarantee of a bumper harvest;" during the exchange and promotion of advanced experience, wealthy middle peasants said, "Advancement is a disadvantage, and visiting is too troublesome," and so on. In short, the wealthy middle peasants did everything possible to hinder us from running high-yield experimental fields. Under such circumstances, the confidence of individual team members in achieving a bumper harvest also wavered. After the Party branch discovered this problem, it promptly strengthened the ideological education of team members, and launched a major socialist propaganda and education movement among the broad masses, thoroughly criticizing the various erroneous ideas of the wealthy middle peasants against running high-yield experimental fields, and strengthened our determination to seize a bumper harvest. I deeply realized that the process of running high-yield cotton experimental fields is not only a struggle between advanced and backward ideas, but also a struggle between two roads. Without the strong leadership of the Party, it would have been impossible for us to achieve any success in cotton cultivation. Only by listening to the Party and following the direction indicated by the Party can we achieve success in everything. I believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, we will achieve even greater success in cotton cultivation.

Two, it is essential to have great ambitions and wage a resolute struggle against all difficulties. Cultivating cotton is like doing other work; we always encounter many difficulties and obstacles in the process of advancing. Last summer, we encountered a severe drought, the worst in thirty or forty years, and the amount of field management work increased by more than double compared to previous years. Wind, hail, and disease and pest disasters were also more severe than in any previous year. Various disasters seriously threatened the normal growth of cotton. Under such circumstances, should we overcome difficulties or bow our heads to them? These were the two roads placed before all our team members. We chose the former, and were not frightened by difficulties. We displayed the heroic spirit of the Great Leap Forward in steel production, declared war on nature, and actively carried out drought resistance and irrigation. When we did not have enough animal power, we pushed by hand. When there were too many fields and too few wells, we could not finish watering during the day, so we worked through the night. We watered once, then watered again, and watered each field quickly, irrigating a total of five times. Diseases and pests were severe, and if one treatment did not work, we treated again, a total of eighteen treatments. In this way, we fought hard for more than one hundred days, overcame the disasters of drought, wind, hail, diseases, and pests, and achieved a bumper cotton harvest. I realized that without great ambitions, nothing can be accomplished. Only with the ambition to build socialism and communism can we exert all our energy, give full play to our subjective initiative, transform nature, and conquer nature. Then, we can achieve great success in all our undertakings.

Three, it is essential to rely on the masses and follow the mass line. In our cotton experimental fields, because we consulted with everyone on everything and followed the mass line, we gained the support of the masses, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and achieved continuous high yields. For example, last year we lacked fertilizer, and other teams voluntarily sent us fertilizer. This year, we wanted to experiment with seedling cultivation and transplanting, but we did not have straw curtains for seedling cultivation, so the masses voluntarily sent us more than forty straw curtains, solving the problem. This made us deeply realize that it is impossible to run high-yield experimental fields and conduct scientific experiments without the support of the broad masses. With more people, there is more strength, more wisdom, and more methods. Only by relying on the masses can we overcome any difficulty, and can any problem be solved.

Four, it is essential to flexibly implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture according to local conditions and timing. In 1959, in cotton cultivation, we flexibly applied the charter according to the specific conditions of each period. Before carrying out each task, we first looked at the weather, soil moisture, and cotton growth. At the same time, we also carefully learned from the experience of other places and experienced farmers, strengthened scientific research, and continuously carried out technological reforms. Last year, we did four things differently from previous years: (1) We changed parallel seedling retention to triangular seedling retention. The advantage of this is not only that it is convenient for field management, but more importantly, it allows cotton seedlings to occupy gaps, fully develop and grow, and solve the problem of dense planting, ventilation, and light transmission. (2) We flexibly topped the cotton. We changed the past practice of topping all the cotton to only topping the narrow rows, leaving the wide rows topped, which could produce more bolls. (3) We changed the past practice of removing all the oil sticks and shoots to appropriately retaining some depending on the cotton growth, so that more cotton bolls could be produced. (4) We retained autumn bolls. Last year, there was a lack of rain in the summer, and boll shedding was severe. In order to ensure high yields, we retained five to seven autumn bolls on each cotton plant. As a result of meticulous management, the cotton quality was still very good. According to yield measurement calculations, the yield of autumn bolls accounted for more than 30% of the total yield. In cotton cultivation, it is essential to look at the weather, look at the land, look at the cotton growth, and be flexible in operations, and never mechanically copy. If we do not do this, it will be impossible for cotton to achieve high yields.

Five, it is essential to help others catch up with and surpass ourselves. People often say, "It's not good if one person learns well, it's good if everyone learns well." This is absolutely true. The purpose of cultivating high-yield cotton experimental fields is to gain experience so that cotton throughout the province and the country can achieve high yields. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and government, we have done some work in helping others catch up with and surpass ourselves. For example, in 1959, under the leadership and care of the Party branch in the management area, we established a cotton red and expert university, and used our cultivation team as an experimental field. Each branch had a young person participate, and everyone studied together, cultivated together, and taught and promoted the experiences that everyone thought were successful and feasible. Liu Shuqin of the Shuangwang team not only cultivated with us, but she also led nine women in the team to cultivate ten mu of high-yield cotton fields. Last year, Xue Junxiu's cotton had many missing seedlings, so I let Junxiu choose the larger seedlings from the seedlings we cultivated and prepared for transplanting. As far as I know, last year, there were seven cotton cultivation teams in our entire management area, with more than 30 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 1,000 to 1,800 jin of seed cotton per mu. In addition, 27 mu of cotton from seven other cotton cultivation teams also achieved yields of more than 700 jin of seed cotton per mu. We often think this way: building a socialist society and allowing 600 million people to live a happy life is such a major task that even if one person had eight hands, it would not be enough. Last year, we expanded our area and harvested more than 150,000 jin of seed cotton. However, the fourteen cotton cultivation teams in the entire management area harvested more than 600,000 jin of seed cotton. By comparison, it is still more beneficial to socialism if everyone increases production. I deeply realize that building socialism requires everyone to be advanced. Our cotton cultivation experience is learned from the masses, and we must also teach the experience to the masses so that all cotton in the country can achieve high yields.

Although we have achieved some success in cotton cultivation, we will never be satisfied with this. In 1959, Xue Junxiu of our management area learned from each other with us, and as a result, caught up with me. The Party secretaries of the county, commune, and management area also cared about me and encouraged us to learn from each other and compete with each other. We must strive for a greater leap forward in 1960, have a new competition, and make even greater achievements. This year, our management area plans to have 50 mu of high-yield fields, with an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, 3 mu of command fields with an average yield of 1,000 jin of lint cotton per mu; 1.5 mu of seedling transplanting with an average yield of 1,400 jin of lint cotton per mu; 2 mu of cotton and onion intercropping on high ridges with an average yield of 1,000 jin of lint cotton per mu; 2 mu of diverse variety experiments; and 1 mu of high-yield fields with an average yield of 1,500 jin of lint cotton per mu. We must continue to adhere to putting politics in command, continuously oppose right-leaning and encourage great effort, and hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We must also promptly summarize and promote existing experience, adopt the method of "three combinations" (combining leaders, cadres, team members, and the masses), "six unifications" (unified leadership, unified planning, unified arrangements, unified measures, unified actions, and unified operations), and "three essentials" (it is essential to listen to the Party, it is essential to carefully learn from the experience of other places and experienced farmers, and it is essential to launch a red banner pacesetter competition movement), to ensure that we pass the "five barriers" of cotton preparation, sowing, seedling protection, boll protection, and harvesting, and achieve a greater area and higher yield of cotton in 1960.

### 听党的话就是胜利  张秋香代表谈种棉连年高产的体会

    听党的话就是胜利
    张秋香代表谈种棉连年高产的体会各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。现在我把我们陕西渭南县城关人民公社棉花作务组的工作情况向大会作一汇报。
    几年来，在各级党政领导的亲切关怀与指导下，我们作务的棉花试验田一连五年获得了平均亩产籽棉千斤以上的高额丰产。特别是在1959年入夏以来，遭遇了三十年来少有的百日大旱，和风、雹、病、虫等自然灾害的严重威胁下，由于有党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞，依靠人民公社的巨大威力，充分发挥了全体组员冲天的革命干劲，因地因时制宜地灵活贯彻执行了农业增产八字宪法，战胜了灾害，棉花仍然获得了高额丰产。1959年共种棉花高产试验田九点四九二亩，平均亩产籽棉一千五百八十七点三斤。其中有一点一三亩平均亩产籽棉一千八百四十三点六斤，比当地平均亩产高出将近十倍。这都是由于在各级党政的正确领导下，坚决贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，和广大群众的积极支持，以及全体组员努力的结果。也是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利。为什么我们务的棉花连年高产呢？我认为主要有下面几点：
    一、要听党的话。听共产党的话没错，跟上毛主席走就是胜利，这是我们解放以来的亲身体会。由于党进行了棉花高产的宣传，我们才想到了棉花高产试验田。几年来，我们在务棉花中，党帮助我们解决了许多困难，不断地对我们进行了教育，提高了思想，给我们指出了方向。特别应该着重指出的是，我们取得胜利的过程，就是开展两条道路斗争的过程。在1959年夏收以后，农村一些富裕中农钻我们工作的空子，抓住微小的一点已经克服过的毛病，加以扩大，攻击我们搞高产试验田。如有的说：“搞棉花高产试验田，花工多，投资大，花不来账”、“务上那么一点棉花，那么多人整天钻到地里，净是磨洋工呢！”诬蔑棉花试验田是“洋工厂”。当棉花遭了大风灾之后，有的富裕中农说：“这下把秋香的卫星刮的钻了地。”在争取多留秋桃时，有的富裕中农说：“立社开黄花，灶火择圪?”、“秋桃坏花多，增产没油水”；在抗旱中，富裕中农说：“今年旱灾大，人力抵抗不住，丰产没保证”；在交流推广先进经验中，富裕中农说：“先进了吃亏，参观太麻烦”等。一句话，富裕中农百般阻难我们搞高产试验田。就在这种情况下，个别组员对丰产信心也动摇了。党总支发现这个问题后，及时加强组员思想教育，又在广大群众中开展了社会主义大宣传教育运动，彻底批判了富裕中农反对搞丰产试验田的种种错误思想，坚定了夺取丰收的意志。我深深体会到：搞棉花高产试验田的过程，不仅有先进思想与落后思想的斗争，也有两条道路的斗争。如果没有党的坚强领导，我们在作务棉花上就不可能取得成绩。只有听党的话，按党指示的方向走，一切事情都能做出成绩。我相信，在党和政府的领导下，我们在作务棉花上会做出更大的成绩。
　　二、要有雄心大志和一切困难作坚决的斗争。作务棉花和做其他工作一样，前进中总会遇到很多困难和阻力。去年夏季遭遇了三、四十年来少有的大干旱，田间管理工作量比往年增加一倍多，风、雹、病虫灾害较过去任何一年也厉害，各种灾害严重地威胁着棉花的正常生长。在这种情况下，是战胜困难，还是向困难低头？这是摆在我们全体组员面前的两条路，我们选择了前一条路，没有被困难吓倒，拿出大炼钢铁的英雄气概，向自然宣战，积极开展抗旱灌溉。畜力不足，我们就用人推，地多井少，白天浇不过来，我们就连夜干，一次水浇完浇二次，一次赶一次地浇，共浇水五次；病虫害严重，防治一次不行，再治一次，先后共防治病虫十八次。就这样苦战了一百多天，战胜了旱、风、雹、病虫灾害，获得了棉花丰收。我体会到，没有一个雄心大志，什么事情都办不成。有了建设社会主义、共产主义的雄心，才能鼓足干劲，才能充分发挥人的主观能动作用，改造自然，战胜自然，我们的一切事业就都能做出伟大的成绩。
    三、要依靠群众，走群众路线。我们在种棉花试验田中，由于事事和大家商量，走群众路线，得到群众支持，才克服了种种困难，获得连年高产。如去年我们缺肥料，其他队就主动送给我们肥料；今年想试验育苗移栽，育苗没草帘，群众就主动送给我们草帘四十多个，解决了问题。使我们深刻体会到，种丰产试验田，进行科学试验，没有广大群众的支持是不行的。人多力量大，智谋广，办法稠。只有依靠群众，再大的困难都能克服，再大的问题都能得到解决。
    四、要因地、因时、灵活贯彻农业增产八字宪法。1959年在作务棉花中，根据各个时期的具体情况，灵活运用。进行每项作务时，先要看天气、看地墒、看棉花生长；同时，还认真学习外地和老农的经验，加强科学研究，不断地进行技术改革。去年我们和往年不同的有四点：（1）把平行留苗改为三角留苗。这样的好处：不仅便于进行田间作务，而且更重要的使棉苗互占空隙，能充分发育生长，解决密植通风透光的问题。（2）灵活打群尖。改过去全部打群尖为只打窄行的群尖，留下宽行的群尖，可以多结桃。（3）改过去全部搬油条、搬桠铃为看棉花生长情况适当留一些，使多结棉桃。（4）留秋桃。去年伏天缺雨，落铃严重。为了保证高产，每株棉花都留上五到七个秋后桃子。由于精细管理的结果，花质仍然很好。据测产计算，秋桃产量占到总产的百分之三十以上。在作务棉花中，一定要看天、看地、看棉花生长情况，灵活作务，决不能死搬硬套。不这样做，棉花就不可能丰产。
    五、要帮助别人赶上自己、超过自己。人常说：“一人学好不算好，大家学好才算好。”这话一点不假。种棉花高产试验田，目的是为取得经验，使全省、全国棉花都高产。几年来，在党政的领导下，我们在帮助别人赶上自己、超过自己方面做了一点工作。如1959年在管区党总支的领导与关怀下，成立棉花红专大学，并以我们作务组为试验田，每个支部都有一个青年参加，大家一块研究，共同作务，大家认为成功可行的经验，就回去传授推广。双王小队刘淑琴，她不仅和我们一块作务，而且，她在队内还领导九个妇女务了十亩棉花丰产田。去年薛俊秀的棉花缺苗很多，我就把我们组育苗准备移栽套种的苗子，让给俊秀选大的移。据我知道，去年我们全管区有七个务棉组，三十多亩棉花，平均亩产籽棉一千至一千八百斤，另有七个务棉组的二十七亩棉花，亩产也达到七百斤籽棉以上。我们经常这样想：建设社会主义社会，让六亿人民都过幸福生活，这样重大的任务，一个人就是长上八只手也是不行的。去年我们面积扩大了，才拾了十五万多斤籽棉。可是全管区十四个务棉组就拾了六十多万斤籽棉。这样一比，还是大家都增产了，才对社会主义贡献大。我深刻体会到：建设社会主义要人人都先进。我们的务棉经验是学群众的，也要把经验教给群众，使全国所有棉花都高产。
    我们虽在作务棉花上取得了一些成绩，但绝不以此而满足。1959年我们管区的薛俊秀和我们互相学习，结果赶上了我。县、公社、管区党委书记也都很关心我，鼓励我们与俊秀互相学习，互相比赛。我们要在1960年争取更大的跃进，来一次更新的比赛，做出更大的成绩。今年我们管区计划五十亩丰产田，平均亩产籽棉一千斤。其中，指挥田三亩，平均亩产皮棉一千斤；育苗移栽一点五亩，平均亩产皮棉一千四百斤；棉花与洋葱高垅间作二亩，平均亩产皮棉一千斤；多样品种试验二亩，高额丰产田一亩，亩产皮棉一千五百斤。我们要继续坚持政治挂帅，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗。并要及时总结推广已有经验，采取“三结合”（领导、干部、组员和群众相结合）、“六统一”（统一领导、统一计划、统一安排、统一措施、统一行动、统一作务）、“三要”（要听党的话、要认真学习外地和老农经验、要开展红旗手竞赛运动）的办法，保证过好棉花的备耕、播种、保苗、保桃、收获“五道关”，实现1960年棉花更大面积更高额的丰产。
