Comrades,

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and will resolutely implement the guidelines and tasks put forward in the reports. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the work of light industry.

**Light Industrial Production Achieved a Brilliant Victory of Continuous Great Leap Forward in 1959**

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, light industry implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and carried out a vigorous and massive movement for increasing production and practicing economy. The political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been raised, and their revolutionary zeal has become even greater. In that year, light industry, like other departments, achieved a brilliant victory of continuous Great Leap Forward. In 1959, the total output value of light industry increased by 34% compared with 1958. The output of the vast majority of products has increased significantly, and the supply of material and cultural necessities for the broad masses of people has also increased. Taking clocks as an example, 5.7 million were produced in 1959, an increase of 85% over the previous year. Now, almost every production team in every people's commune in our country has alarm clocks for timely work and rest. More than 1.2 million sewing machines were produced in 1958 and 1959. People's communes in rural areas have now established sewing factories. 37 million thermos bottles were produced in 1959, an increase of 34% over the previous year. More than 130 million fountain pens were produced in 1959, an increase of 71% over the previous year. 2.13 million tons of paper were produced in 1959, an increase of 31% over the previous year. 1.46 million tons of edible vegetable oil were produced in 1959, an increase of 17% over the previous year. 1.13 million tons of sugar were produced in 1959, an increase of 26% over the previous year. The production of other items such as cameras, leather shoes, bicycles, enamel products, soap, cigarettes, canned food, wine, etc., also increased significantly in 1959 compared with 1958. Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward for two years, the 1962 targets for machine-made paper and crude salt stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan have been victoriously completed three years ahead of schedule.

While the output of light industrial products has increased, the quality has also been continuously improved, and new products and varieties have also increased greatly. Many products that our country could not produce in the past or had very small output and relied on imports are now being manufactured by ourselves, and we have also produced a batch of high-grade and precision products, such as the giant clock used at the Beijing Railway Station, color movie film, wide screens, men's and women's watches, electronic organs, 220,000-volt cable paper, crystal glass, etc. The production of many new arts and crafts products has both inherited China's excellent artistic traditions and promoted the unique styles of various regions and ethnic groups.

The vigorous development and rapid development of China's light industry has powerfully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system and the Party's deep concern for the people's lives. The continuous Great Leap Forward in light industry for two years is the result of implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and it is the result of adhering to putting politics in command, carrying out mass movements, and continuing to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. It should be pointed out that developing small and medium-sized enterprises in light industrial production and making both foreign and indigenous production methods go hand in hand is of extremely important significance. In 1959, small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for about three-fifths of the total paper production; the output of small and medium-sized sugar mills accounted for about one-half of the total sugar production; and small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for more than two-thirds of the total edible vegetable oil production. In other industries such as woodworking, sewing, leather making, ceramics, alcohol, starch, dairy products, and arts and crafts, the output of small and medium-sized enterprises accounts for a large proportion. In the process of developing small and medium-sized enterprises in various regions, numerous rural people's commune industries, urban people's commune industries, and street industries have been established. These are playing an increasingly obvious positive role in vigorously supporting agricultural production, accelerating the development of light industry, and organizing the people's economic life.

**This Year, China's Light Industrial Production Will Have a Better Leap Forward**

In 1960, light industrial production will have a greater leap forward than in 1959. According to the state plan, among more than 100 major products, the planned output of many products this year will increase by 20%, 30%, and 40% to 50% or more compared with last year. Planned indicators such as product variety, quality, cost, and labor productivity will also leap forward accordingly. If light industry began its Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, then an even better continuous leap forward will occur in 1960.

The fundamental task of light industry is to produce more and better light industrial products to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people; to accumulate more funds for China's socialist construction; and at the same time to produce some means of production to vigorously support the Great Leap Forward in heavy industry and agriculture. We have full confidence in striving to complete this glorious task. To complete this task, we must: under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, resolutely implement the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, adhere to putting politics in command, and carry out mass movements. Practice has proven that this is a correct road that is invincible. At present, we should seize the central link of technical innovation and technical revolution, and as soon as possible change manual operations in light industrial departments to mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; industries and enterprises with a certain degree of mechanization should focus on the weak links of loading and unloading of raw materials and fuels, in-plant transportation, and finished product packaging, and vigorously carry out mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. At present, this movement has been vigorously launched on the national light industry front. In a short period of two or three months, a lively situation has emerged where "everyone proposes suggestions, everyone engages in innovation, and every industry has its own creations." For example, since the various enterprises of the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has rapidly increased from 48% at the end of last year to more than 80% in mid-March this year. A total of 53,000 people have been freed from manual labor and heavy physical labor, saving more than 12,000 laborers. Xingtai County, Hebei Province, pioneered the mechanization of cloth shoe production, and from then on, manual shoe making can be replaced by machines. After a on-site meeting was held, it is being promoted nationwide. If it is earnestly implemented, then producing 1.5 billion pairs of cloth shoes this year can save 7 million laborers. Shandong Province has launched a coal gasification movement, and the scope of application of coal gas has been expanded not only to firing ceramic kilns, brick and tile kilns, and melting glass, but also to boilers, various internal combustion engines (including diesel engines, gasoline engines, boiler tractors, and gas engines, etc.), as well as canteens for cooking and heating. Generally, coal consumption is saved by about 30%, and low-quality coal can be burned, and liquid fuels for some internal combustion engines can be replaced. It can improve the yield rate, improve the working conditions of high-temperature operations, and greatly save transportation capacity. Facts have proven that this is a cost-effective experience. Shandong's experience has been successful and is now being actively promoted in the national light industry system. In order to promote the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in light industry, we must continue to advocate breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and developing the communist style of combining daring to think, daring to act, and scientific analysis among all employees. Formulate plans, vigorously promote collaboration, exchange experiences, strengthen scientific and technological research, train cadres in a planned way, and expand the scientific and technological team. In the movement, all technical innovations and technical revolutions must be closely integrated with production, seize the weak links in production, concentrate efforts, break through key points, and continuously exert potential strength. We should adopt the method of relying on our own efforts as the main and combining foreign and indigenous methods. Use foreign methods where possible, use indigenous methods where possible, and start with indigenous methods first, or combine foreign and indigenous methods. Effectively solve the problem of insufficient materials and technical strength. Insist on matching the advanced experiences of technical innovation that appear in various industries and enterprises, and summarize and promote them in a timely manner. We grasp both technically advanced units and help technically backward units, grasp both cutting-edge technologies and simpler technologies, and further push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in light industry to a new high.

In the priority development of China's heavy industry, light industry has been given great material and technical support, which has promoted the great development of light industry. The chemical and machinery departments are supplying more and more of the raw materials and machinery and equipment needed for the development of light industry, and cooperation is becoming more and more strengthened. Whether now or in future years, we must strive for the support and cooperation of the heavy industry departments. At the same time, light industry departments should also take active measures to produce some chemical raw materials (such as caustic soda, soda ash, red alum, tannin extract, etc.) themselves and manufacture some specialized equipment (such as small and medium-sized sugar machines, paper machines, etc.) as much as possible to meet this need.

**Expanding the Sources of Raw Materials in Many Ways is an Important Key to Increasing Light Industrial Production**

Expanding the sources of raw materials in many ways is an important key to increasing light industrial production. Therefore, we must do everything possible to increase income and reduce expenditure. Under the unified leadership of local party committees, light industry departments should take the initiative to strengthen close cooperation with agriculture, commerce, and transportation departments, and vigorously do a good job in the production, procurement, transportation, and processing of agricultural and sideline products, so as to facilitate the timely supply of raw materials. On the one hand, adhere to the principle of building factories near raw materials, on the other hand, actively establish raw material bases near old factories. Light industrial enterprises should help people's communes to develop raw material production in a planned way, cultivate fine varieties, improve farming and breeding techniques, and improve the commodity rate and quality of agricultural and sideline products, so that factories can obtain more and better agricultural raw materials. After the factory establishes a raw material base, the transportation of raw materials is convenient, which can shorten the transportation distance and save transportation capacity. Combining the factory and the raw material base is not only conducive to the development of diversified operations and increased income for the communes, but also conducive to improving the layout of light industry. This method should be adopted at present and is also an important measure for long-term development. To this end, this year we will focus on establishing bases for papermaking grass fiber raw materials, sugar crops, tobacco leaves, fruits and vegetables, starch, fragrance, grapes, hops, barley, livestock and dairy sources, poultry, and special raw materials for handicrafts. Most of the raw materials for light industry come from agriculture. We should vigorously engage in the processing of agricultural and sideline products and carry out comprehensive utilization. It can directly increase raw materials, and also use a large number of by-products as feed and fertilizer to actively support the needs of rapid development of agriculture and animal husbandry. We should also widely collect and utilize various wild plant raw materials, and we should "rely on water to eat water, raise fish by eating fish, rely on mountains to eat mountains, and raise mountains by eating mountains."
"Cut branches without cutting down trees, cut vines without digging roots." We must strive to do a good job in cultivation and make them grow continuously. All industries and enterprises in light industry must continue to practice economy and improve the utilization rate and yield rate of raw materials. On the premise of ensuring quality, rationally reduce the quota for raw material consumption. Make full use of existing and new substitute raw materials. Recycle waste products and use the leftovers from large factories. In short, we must make greater efforts to increase raw materials, materials, and fuels to meet the needs of production development.

**Actively Developing Urban and Rural People's Commune Industry and Urban Street Industry is an Important Task for Light Industry Departments This Year**

Actively developing the production of rural people's commune industry, urban people's commune industry, and urban street industry is an important task for light industry departments and handicraft management departments at all levels in 1960. Rural people's commune industry must resolutely implement the service for agricultural production, better support agricultural production, support agricultural technical transformation, should make full use of local raw materials, actively produce various small farm tools, improved farm tools, water conservancy tools, and transportation tools, etc., adapt to local conditions, manufacture and repair locally, and develop the production of local fertilizers, pesticides, and small machinery industry. As mentioned above, we must also develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products to better serve agriculture, large industry, the socialist market, and the lives of commune members. The main tasks of urban people's commune industry and street industry are to serve large industry. Actively develop the production of various small daily-use products, undertake the processing of materials supplied by large factories, and at the same time vigorously engage in service businesses to serve the lives of urban residents and serve the needs of large industry and export. In 1960, urban and rural commune industry and street industry need to undergo a major development. We must not only strive to improve the technical level of existing enterprises and expand the scale of production, but also actively develop a number of new small indigenous groups and small foreign groups or enterprises combining foreign and indigenous methods to increase production. In order to accelerate the development of urban and rural people's commune industry and street industry, light industry departments at all levels must strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan, and make overall arrangements, and gradually incorporate them into the national plan.

Now, light industry has achieved the initial victory of the "good start" in 1960. We believe that with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and with the high enthusiasm and creativity of the national light industry workers, China's light industry will be able to leap forward better and more comprehensively. We must strive to complete the tasks of 1960.

    我国轻工业生产欣欣向荣
    轻工业部部长李烛尘的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告，并将坚决贯彻执行报告所提出的方针任务。现在我就轻工业工作方面发表一些意见。
    一九五九年轻工业生产取得了连续大跃进的辉煌胜利
    1959年轻工业在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会的决议，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，广大职工群众的政治思想觉悟提高了，革命干劲更大了，这一年，轻工业同其他部门一样，取得了连续大跃进的辉煌胜利。1959年轻工业总产值比1958年增长了34％。绝大多数产品产量有了很大的增长，供应给广大人民物质和文化生活用品也愈来愈多。以时钟为例，1959年生产了五百七十万只，比上年增长85％，现在我国农村中差不多每一个人民公社的每个生产小队都有闹钟来按时作息了；缝纫机在1958年、1959年共生产了一百二十多万架，农村人民公社现在差不多都建立了缝纫厂；热水瓶1959年生产了三千七百万只，比上年增长34％；自来水笔1959年生产了一亿三千多万支，比上年增长71％；纸1959年生产了二百一十三万吨，比上年增长31％；食用植物油1959年生产了一百四十六万吨，比上年增长17％；糖1959年生产了一百一十三万吨，比上年增长26％；其他如照相机、皮鞋、自行车、搪瓷制品、肥皂、卷烟、罐头、酒等等，1959年的生产量都比1958年有较大的增长。由于两年连续的大跃进，第二个五年计划规定机制纸和原盐的1962年指标，都已经提前三年胜利地完成了。
    轻工业产品在产量增长的同时，质量也不断改善，新产品和新品种也大大增加。许多过去我国不能生产或者产量很小而依赖进口的产品，现在我们已经开始自己制造了，并且还制出了一批高级、精密的产品，像北京火车站上用的巨型时钟、五彩电影胶片、宽银幕屏、男女用手表、电子琴、二十二万伏电缆纸、结晶玻璃等等。许多新的工艺美术品的生产，既继承了我国优秀的艺术传统，又发扬了各地区、各民族的独特风格。
    我国轻工业生产的欣欣向荣、迅速发展，有力地证明了社会主义制度的优越性和党对人民生活的深切关怀。轻工业连续两年大跃进，是由于贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的结果，是由于坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，继续开展技术革新和技术革命运动的结果。应当指出在轻工业生产方面发展中小型企业，并使洋法生产和土法生产并举，具有极其重要的意义。1959年纸的总产量中，由中小型企业生产的占五分之三左右；糖的总产量中，中小型糖厂的产量约占二分之一左右；食用植物油的总产量中，由中小型企业生产的占三分之二以上。其他如木器制造、缝纫、制革、陶瓷、酒精、淀粉、乳品、工艺美术等行业更是中小型的产量占有很大比重。各地发展中小型企业的过程中，举办了为数众多的农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和街道工业，这对于大力支援农业生产、加速轻工业发展、以及组织人民经济生活等方面愈来愈明显地发挥它的积极作用。
    今年我国的轻工业生产将有更好的跃进
    1960年轻工业生产将比1959年有更大的跃进。根据国家计划的安排，在一百多种主要产品中，今年许多产品的计划产量，分别比去年增长百分之二十几、三十几和四十至五十以上。产品品种、质量、成本、劳动生产率等计划指标都相应地跃进。如果说，1958年、1959年轻工业是开始大跃进，那么更好的继续跃进就在1960年。
    轻工业的根本任务，是要生产更多、更好的轻工业品，来满足人民日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要；要为我国社会主义建设积累更多的资金；同时还生产一部分生产资料，大力支援重工业和农业的大跃进。我们完全有信心去努力完成这个光荣任务。要完成这个任务，就必须：在各级党委的统一领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。实践证明，这是无往而不胜的正确道路。当前，应该抓住技术革新和技术革命这个中心环节，尽快地把轻工业部门中手工操作改变为机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化；有一定机械化程度的行业和企业，要抓紧原料、燃料的装卸、厂内运输、成品包装等薄弱环节，大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。目前这个运动已经在全国轻工业战线上热火朝天地开展起来了，在短短两、三个月的时间内，已经出现了“人人提倡议、个个闹革新，行行业业有创举”的生动活泼的局面。比如上海市轻工局各企业大闹技术革新和技术革命以来，机械化、半机械化程度已由去年年底的48％，到今年3月中旬很快提高到80％多，共有五万三千人摆脱了手工操作和笨重的体力劳动。节约劳动力一万二千余人。河北省邢台县首创布鞋生产机械化，从此手工制鞋可用机器来代替了，经过召开现场会议，正在全国推广，如果认真贯彻，那么今年生产十五亿双布鞋，就可以节约七百万个劳动力。山东省开展煤气化运动，把煤气应用的范围不仅用于烧陶瓷窑、砖瓦窑、熔化玻璃，而且扩大到烧锅炉、各种内燃机（包括柴油机、汽油机、锅驼机和煤气机等）以及食堂烧锅灶煮饭取暖等方面，一般节约用煤达30％左右，且能够烧低质煤，能够代替一部分内燃机的液体燃料；可以提高成品率，可以改善高温作业的劳动条件，可以大大节约运输力量等等。事实证明，这是一项多快好省的经验。山东这个经验是成功的，现在正在全国轻工业系统中积极推广。为了促进轻工业技术革新和技术革命运动的进一步开展，必须在全体职工中继续提倡大破迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢干和科学分析相结合的共产主义风格。制订规划，大搞协作，交流经验，加强科学技术研究，有计划培养干部，扩大科学技术队伍。在运动中，一切技术革新和技术革命都必须紧密地结合生产，抓住生产中的薄弱环节，集中力量，突破重点，不断发挥潜在力量。应当采取自力更生为主和洋土结合的办法，能洋就洋，能土就土，土法先上马，或者土洋结合。有效地解决物资和技术力量不足的问题。坚持把各行业、各企业中出现的技术革新的先进经验加以配套，及时地总结推广，我们既抓技术先进的单位，又帮助技术落后的单位，既抓尖端的技术，更抓简易的技术，把轻工业技术革新和技术革命运动进一步推向新的高潮。
    我国重工业优先发展中，给予了轻工业以很大的物资和技术的支援，促进了轻工业的大发展。化工、机械等部门对轻工业发展所需的原料和机器设备，供应的数量愈来愈多了，协作愈来愈加强了，无论现在和今后年份，我们都必须争取重工业部门的支援和协作。同时，轻工业部门也应当采取积极的措施，自己努力生产部分化工原料（如烧碱、纯碱、红矾、栲胶等）和制造若干专业设备（如中小型的制糖机、造纸机等），尽可能适应这种需要。
    多方面扩大原料来源，是轻工业增产的重要关键
    从多方面扩大原料来源，是轻工业增产的重要关键。因此必须千方百计开源节流。轻工业部门在地方党委的统一领导下，应主动地加强与农业、商业和交通运输部门的密切协作，大力做好农副产品的生产、收购、调运和加工工作，以有利于原料的及时供应。一方面坚持就原料建厂的原则，另方面要积极在老厂附近建立原料基地。轻工业企业应当帮助人民公社有计划地发展原料生产，培育良种，改进耕作饲养技术，提高农副产品的商品率和它的质量，使工厂得到又多又好的农业原料。工厂建立原料基地以后，原料运送便利，可以缩短运输里程，节省运输力。把工厂和原料基地结合起来，不仅有利于公社发展多种经营，增加收入，而且有利于改善轻工业布局。这种办法，目前应当采用，也是长远发展的一项重要措施。为此，今年重点建立造纸草类纤维原料、糖料、烟叶、果蔬、淀粉、芳香、葡萄、酒花、大麦、畜牧乳源、家禽及手工业特种原料的基地。轻工业原料大部分来自农业，应当大搞农副产品加工和开展综合利用。它既能直接增加原料，又可利用大量的副产品做饲料与肥料，积极支援农业和畜牧业迅速发展的需要。我们还应当广泛收集和利用各种野生植物原料，应做到“靠水吃水，吃鱼养鱼，靠山吃山，吃山养山。”
  “伐枝不砍树，割藤不挖根”。要努力做好培育工作，使其不断生长。轻工业各行业、各企业都要继续厉行节约，提高原材料的利用率和出品率。在保证质量的前提下，合理降低原材料消耗定额。充分利用原有的和新的代用原料。回收废品废料和利用大工厂的下脚料。总之，我们要作更大的努力增加原料、材料、燃料，以适应生产发展的需要。
    积极发展城乡人民公社工业和城市街道工业，是今年轻工业部门的重大任务
    积极发展农村人民公社工业、城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业的生产，是1960年各级轻工业部门、手工业管理部门的重大任务，农村人民公社工业要坚决贯彻为农业生产服务，更好地支援农业生产，支援农业技术改造，应当充分利用当地的原料、材料，积极生产各种小农具、改良农具、水利工具和运输工具等，因地制宜，就地制造和修理，且发展土化肥、农药和小型机械工业的生产。如上面所讲的还要发展农副产品加工，更好的为农业、为大工业、为社会主义市场和社员生活服务。城市人民公社工业和街道工业的主要任务是为大工业服务。积极发展各种日用小产品的生产，承制大工厂的来料加工，同时大搞服务性业务，为城市居民生活服务，为大工业和出口需要服务。1960年城乡公社工业和街道工业需要来个大发展，既要努力提高原有企业的技术水平，扩大生产规模，又要积极发展一批新的小土群和小洋群或者洋土结合的企业，增加生产。为了加速城乡人民公社工业和街道工业的发展，各级轻工业部门要加强领导，全面规划，统筹安排，把它们逐步纳入国家计划。
    现在，轻工业已经实现了1960年“开门红”的初步胜利，我们相信，有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，有全国轻工业职工的高度积极性和创造性，我国轻工业一定能够更好、更全面的跃进，我们一定要为完成1960年的任务而奋斗。
    我的发言不妥之处，请批评指正。
