		Hebei Intensifies Efforts to Manage Wheat at Jointing Stage
		A new upsurge of competition to catch up (inferior seedlings catching up with superior seedlings, low yields catching up with high yields, spring wheat catching up with autumn wheat) and surpass (achieving exceeding contracted output) with a focus on intensified management of wheat at the jointing stage is sweeping across Hebei Province. In this movement, all localities have strengthened leadership in weak links. According to statistics from Baoding and Handan regions, more than 7,600 specialized management teams for Category III wheat and low-yield wheat have been organized, and over 80,000 laborers have been mobilized to vigorously promote an upgraded wheat field management movement centered on water and fertilizer. To date, over 23 million mu of wheat fields have been irrigated, over 28 million mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer, and over 26 million mu have been cultivated in the province.

		Qinghai Checks and Replenishes Seedlings in Early-Sown Areas
		Qinghai's early-sown areas are checking and replenishing seedlings. In Ledu County, where the climate is relatively warm, more than 250,000 mu of spring wheat and other crops have emerged, of which more than 10,000 mu with significant seedling deficiencies have been fully replenished. In Hualong Hui Autonomous County, each commune has categorized and ranked wheat fields, established a responsibility system of contracted management by area, and launched a competition between teams and groups to achieve full and thriving seedlings. In Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, 170,000 mu of crops have emerged, and over 20,000 mu have already been checked and replenished.

		Zhejiang Takes Swift Action to Cultivate Strong Seedlings
		To ensure early and sufficient transplanting of early rice, Zhejiang is taking swift action to cultivate strong seedlings. Party committee secretaries at all levels in the Wenzhou region have gone deep into production teams to inspect the growth of seedlings plot by plot. Many communes have adopted measures such as erecting windbreaks around warm beds and using nighttime smoke to keep them warm. When the seedlings grow to one inch high, they are watered with human manure three times a day. In the Jinhua region, a total of 150,000 people are working day and night in the fields, and fertilizer has been applied once or twice to 558,000 mu of seedling fields. The Ningbo area is vigorously promoting "command seedling fields," effectively promoting the cultivation and management of seedlings.

		Penglai Comprehensively Reforms Peanut Sowing Technology
		Peanut sowing in Penglai County, Shandong Province, has been advanced by ten days compared to previous years. In terms of sowing technology, three key reforms have been comprehensively implemented: Firstly, in seed treatment, coarse selection and mixed sowing have been replaced by three-level seed selection and graded sowing, and warm water soaking has been replaced by soaking and germination. Secondly, water is used as the guiding principle to promote ridged fields and prepare for water conservancy and high yields. Thirdly, seedlings are classified and determined according to local conditions, and reasonable close planting is practiced. Currently, over 27,000 mu of peanuts have been sown throughout the county.

		Qianyang Area Strengthens Field Management of Newly Reclaimed Land
		After sowing over 2.63 million mu of miscellaneous grains on the newly opened wasteland and forest land in the Qianyang area of Hunan Province, the area has actively organized 130,000 laborers to carry out a concentrated field management campaign centered on ensuring full, strong, and uniform seedlings, determined to make newly reclaimed land catch up with mature land. Within half a month, the area has urgently replenished seedlings, thinned seedlings, and transplanted seedlings on an area of over 2 million mu, cultivated and weeded over 1.5 million mu, and, according to incomplete statistics, top-dressed fertilizer on over 900,000 mu of miscellaneous grains.

		Tianshui Area Launches Rice-Up-the-Mountains Movement
		Some people's communes south of the Wei River in the Tianshui area of Gansu Province are closely integrating water conservancy construction with the drought resistance movement to divert water, intercept streams, and launch a rice-up-the-mountains movement.

		In the movement, various localities have devised many effective methods to solve the water source problem for mountain rice fields according to local conditions. For example, in Pingluo Commune in Wudu County, according to the rule that mountains are high and water is high, measures such as digging wells, opening canals for diversion, and lifting water for irrigation have been adopted to build over 2,000 mu of rice fields on mountains with an altitude of 1,000 to 1,300 meters.

    青海早播地区查苗补苗
    青海早播地区正在查苗补苗。在气候较暖的乐都县，已有二十五万多亩春麦等作物出苗，其中缺苗较多的一万多亩已经补全；化隆回族自治县各公社把麦田分类排队，建立了划片包干的管理责任制，开展了队与队、组与组的比苗全苗旺的竞赛；互助土族自治县有十七万亩作物出苗，已经查苗补苗的有两万多亩。
    浙江各地雷厉风行培育壮秧
    浙江各地为保证早稻早插插足，正雷厉风行培育壮秧。温州地区各级党委书记纷纷深入生产队，逐丘检查秧苗生长情况，许多公社采取了温床周围搭防风帐夜间熏烟保暖，秧苗长到一寸高时，每天浇人粪尿三次；金华地区共有十五万人日夜奋战田间，已给五十五万八千多亩秧田普遍施了一次到二次肥料；宁波专区大搞“指挥秧田”，有效地促进了秧苗的培育管理。
