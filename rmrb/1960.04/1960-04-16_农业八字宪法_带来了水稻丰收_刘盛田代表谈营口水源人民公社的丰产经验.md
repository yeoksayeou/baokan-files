"Agricultural Eight-Character Charter" Brings Rice Harvest
Representative Liu Shengtian Discusses the High-Yield Experience of Yingkou Shuiyuan People's Commune

Presidium, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Chunfu and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. I would like to report to the conference on the situation of our Yingkou County Shuiyuan People's Commune resolutely implementing the "Agricultural Eight-Character Charter," overcoming floods and alkali damage, and achieving large-scale bumper harvests.

Our commune has a total of 9,992 households, all living on the left bank of the lower reaches of the Liao River. Most of the land is saline-alkali lowland. In the old society, it suffered from floods every year. The masses said it was "the tail end of nine rivers, with floods nine years out of ten." Even in good years, the saline-alkali land cultivated by poor people did not yield good harvests. Coupled with the reactionary rule and exploitation by landlords, it was truly a combination of natural disasters and man-made misfortunes. Nine out of ten families went hungry every year. In the past, there were two folk songs circulating:

	Thatched houses leak to the sky, broken kang mats expose the bricks, the wind howls outside, and it's cold inside, one piece of clothing worn by three generations. The moneybags are strange, they hoard grain in famine years and refuse to sell it, forcing the poor to have no way to live, selling their sons and daughters to other places.

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with the strong support of leaders at all levels, after several years of arduous struggle, we finally turned alkali land into fertile fields, with more and more grain and better and better lives. Especially after the establishment of the people's commune, these changes have become even more prominent. In 1959, despite suffering from a severe drought, our commune was still able to achieve a large-scale bumper harvest of rice, with an average yield of 580 jin per mu, an increase of 57% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. More than 10,000 mu out of 94,534 mu yielded over 1,000 jin per mu, and the experimental fields of the county and commune party committees achieved an average yield of 2,017 jin per mu. How was the large-scale bumper harvest of rice achieved? The most fundamental thing is that we resolutely implemented the "Agricultural Eight-Character Charter" proposed by Chairman Mao.

In 1959, we encountered a rare severe drought. It did not rain for more than sixty days. The water level of the Liao River dropped sharply. The pumping station could not pump water, and the seawater flowed back, seriously affecting rice production. If we relied on "heaven for food," there would be no harvest in the fall. In 1942, seawater flowed back for twelve days, and more than sixty people starved to death in one village. This time, the seawater flowed back from the end of March to June 25th, for nearly three months. The pumping station stopped for a month without pumping water. Under this severe situation, we relied on the superior system of the people's commune and, under the correct leadership of the higher-level party committee, proposed the slogan that men, women, old and young should all go out to "protect every seedling with a drop of water." We transferred 3,000 people from the entire commune to work day and night for five days, digging a four-li-long "sunny day river." When the drought was most severe, we organized another 1,400 people to dig a four-li-long Qili River, solving the problem of water for 30,000 mu of paddy fields and six production teams during rice transplanting. We also cleared the silt from 68 channels, dug 84 ditches of various kinds, and 82 spring pits. Later, we jointly constructed a project to divert water from the Taizi River with neighboring communes, spending a total of 720,000 workdays. Together with the water conservancy projects built in previous years, we finally realized a river network throughout our entire commune. In the fight against drought, the responsible comrades of the county and commune party committees and the members ate in the fields, lived in the fields, participated in the battle, and directed the battle. In the fight against drought, there were not only young people but also women who worked day and night to find water, rescuing rice. There were also the eighteen old heroes over the age of sixty who participated in the battle at the same time, which caused a sensation throughout the commune. The people's bold words were:

	Thousands of troops and horses set out together,
	Anti-drought heroes make the dragon angry;
	Even if it doesn't rain until autumn,
	We guarantee that satellites will go into the sky.

In terms of fertilization, we were not accustomed to applying base fertilizer in the past. Someone from outside sent us a limerick: "People have no toilets, pigs have no pens, cattle and horses have no sheds and wander the streets, land is not fertilized as an old habit." After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, we realized the importance of increasing base fertilizer for improving soil and increasing yield. However, changing the habits of the masses for many years was not without ideological struggle. A few people also said, "The big willow tree does not need fertilizer, it grows tall and big; the donkey's tail grows to the anus and it is still so thick and so long." Through the Party's continuous education and several years of practice, we have changed the old habit of not applying base fertilizer in the past, and fertilizer accumulation has become more and more important. In 1959, the state unified and balanced chemical fertilizers. The supply of ammonium sulfate was reduced by half compared to previous years, from 70 jin per mu in the past to about 30 jin. Some people then developed pessimistic emotions that the reduction of chemical fertilizers would prevent yield increases. The Party committee promptly discovered and criticized this ideological tendency and launched a mass movement to accumulate farm manure, vigorously promoting high-temperature composting, returning rice straw to the fields, burning field soil, digging large pits, dismantling kangs, changing pot stands, sweeping chimneys, clearing pig pens, piling green manure, pressing green manure, etc., so that each mu of paddy field applied 12,000 to 14,000 jin of fertilizer. In this way, the reduction of chemical fertilizers not only did not reduce yield but also enhanced the ability of rice to resist lodging, and the rice grains were full. In the past, a bag of rice weighed 130 jin, but in 1959 it exceeded 160 jin; each jin of rice decreased from 22,000 grains to about 20,000 grains.

Because of the many benefits of applying farm manure, the enthusiasm of the masses is getting higher and higher, and some elderly people also go everywhere early and late to pick up manure. Vigorous fertilizer accumulation has also promoted the development of animal husbandry. In 1958, the entire commune raised 3,700 pigs, which increased to more than 9,000 in 1959. This also accumulated a large amount of manure for a greater harvest this year.

Rational close planting is also one of the most acute issues of ideological struggle in the past year. From cadres to the masses, there are different understandings and different opinions. One is: resolutely promote the experience of 40,000 seedlings per mu, which has been successfully applied in 1958 and is suitable for local conditions. The other is advocated not to plant closely, and reduce the number of seedlings per mu to the level of 20,000 seedlings per mu before 1957. The reasons are: the reduction of chemical fertilizer, the lack of manpower, close planting is labor-intensive, and the seedlings cannot be finished and do not grow well. Some also said: "Sparse planting is not discarded, sparse planting is not discarded, sparse planting cannot be discarded in the fall; close planting is not done, close planting is not done, close planting will beg for food in the fall." In response to these two different understandings, we carried out a commune-wide, party-wide, and people-wide debate, and unified our understanding by comparing the cases of production teams planting 40,000 seedlings per mu and achieving high yields in the fall with the facts of planting 20,000 seedlings and not achieving high yields. In this way, in 1959, there were 10,000 mu of rice in the entire commune with more than 70,000 seedlings per mu, 20,000 mu with 50,000 to 60,000 seedlings, and 60,000 mu with 30,000 to 40,000 seedlings. Only a very small number had about 20,000 seedlings. In the fall, it was actually clear that the yield per mu of those planting 20,000 seedlings did not exceed 400 jin, and the vast majority of those with a yield of about 1,000 jin per mu had a close planting density of 50,000 seedlings. This used facts to give a severe blow to right-leaning conservative ideas or people with ulterior motives.

Deep plowing is an indispensable measure to improve saline-alkali land. Whether it is soaking the fields to wash away alkali or draining alkali through ditches and rivers, the land must be deeply plowed. Our commune deeply plowed more than 60,000 mu of land in 1958. The masses summarized the benefits of deep plowing as: "Deep plowing is good, deep plowing is good, there are no weeds in the deeply plowed land, the harm of alkali is greatly reduced, pests and bacteria are frozen to death, crops grow vigorously, the yield is high in the fall, we really benefit this year, and we will definitely do it greatly next year."

Vigorously promoting fine varieties also played a significant role in increasing production in 1959. In 1959, more than 95% of the paddy fields in the entire commune were planted with the "Weiguo" variety. This variety was introduced from Xiongyuecheng in 1952 with two jin of seeds and gradually became popular in our area. Now this excellent variety is supplied in large quantities to other places every year. We are also experimenting with several early-maturing varieties. In terms of seed selection, we adopt a combination of mass selection, single-ear transmission, professional personnel, and the broad masses of commune members to cultivate more excellent varieties to meet the needs of all parties.

In field management, based on the experience of several years of high yields, we have summarized four sentences: "Strive to be ahead in every step, one early is a hundred early, do not transplant rice seedlings in July, do not weed in August." In 1959, rice transplanting was advanced by twenty-five days compared to previous years. In the later stage of rice transplanting, another major debate was launched on how to manage the seedlings well. The masses said, "If you don't weed in July, the rice will not grow well, the yield will not be high, and the quality will not be good." According to the voices of the masses and the characteristics of being busy and having a lot of work at the time, we organized a shock weeding and conducted a large-scale evaluation and inspection in a timely manner. At this time, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed, which played a huge role in anti-rightism and boosting morale to further set off a new upsurge in production.

In autumn, we earnestly implemented the instructions of the provincial, municipal, and county party committees to "cut at 90% maturity, harvest at 100%, and ensure that every grain returns home." We adopted some new measures for three different types of rice seedlings, loudly proposing that first-class seedlings ride the wind and waves, second-class seedlings do not give way, and third-class seedlings catch up. We adopted the method of "four priorities" for third-class seedlings, namely, priority in weeding, priority in topdressing, priority in irrigation, and priority in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, eliminating third-class seedlings and third-class land. We also detected and eliminated rice blast and leaf rollers as early as possible, ensuring the normal growth of rice seedlings.

It is precisely because we earnestly implemented the "Agricultural Eight-Character Charter" and relied on the superior system of the people's commune that we were able to overcome the severe drought and achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production than in 1958, realizing water networking ahead of schedule. The leap forward in 1959 also made us deeply realize that as long as we earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, move forward in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, and rely on the broad masses, we can overcome all difficulties and move from one victory to another. In the future, we are determined to study and master Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and earnestly to ensure greater and greater victories in the future.

    “农业八字宪法”带来了水稻丰收
    刘盛田代表谈营口水源人民公社的丰产经验主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李春富副总理和李先念副总理的报告，并保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。我仅就我们营口县水源人民公社坚决贯彻“农业八字宪法”，战胜水灾碱害，取得大面积的丰收的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    我们公社一共有九千九百九十二户，都居住在辽河下游的左岸，土地大部分是盐碱洼地，在旧社会年年遭受洪水灾害，群众说是“九河下梢，十年九涝”。就是碰上好年头，穷人家种的盐碱地也没有好收成，再加上反动统治和地主的盘剥，真是天灾人祸，十家有九家年年挨饿。在过去流传着这样两段歌谣：
    破草房露着天，破炕席露着砖，屋外刮风屋里寒，一件衣服三辈穿。有钱鬼，生的怪，年荒存粮他不卖，逼的穷人没法活，卖儿卖女上边外。
    解放以后，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下和各级领导的大力支持，经过几年的艰苦奋战，终于把碱地变成良田，粮食越打越多，生活越过越好。特别是人民公社建立以后，这些变化更加突出了。1959年我社在遭受严重旱灾的情况下，还能取得水稻大面积丰产，平均亩产达到五百八十斤，比大跃进1958年还增长了57％，并在九万四千五百三十四亩中有一万多亩是亩产千斤，县委和公社党委的试验田每亩平均产量达到二千零一十七斤。水稻的大面积丰产是怎样取得的呢？最根本的是我们坚决地贯彻了毛主席提出的“农业八字宪法”。
    1959年我们遇到了少有的大旱六十多天没有下雨，辽河水位急骤下降，抽水站抽不出水来，海潮咸水倒灌，严重的影响了水稻的生产，要是“靠天吃饭”，秋后就会颗粒不收。1942年海水倒灌十二天，一个屯子就饿死了六十多人，这次海水倒灌从3月末起一直到6月25日，将近三个来月扬水场停车一个月没抽水，在这种严重的情况下，我们依靠了人民公社的优越制度，在上级党委的正确领导下，提出男女老少齐出动“有一滴水保一棵苗”的口号，从全公社抽调三千人突击五昼夜，挖了四华里长的晴天河，旱象最严重时，又组织了一千四百人挖了一条四华里长的奇李河，解决了三万亩水田和六个生产队插秧时的用水。还清除六十八条渠道的淤泥，开挖各种水沟八十四条、泉坑八十二处，以后又与邻近公社共同兴修了引太子河水工程，共花费了七十二万个工日，加上前几年兴修的水利工程，终于使我们全公社实现了河网化。在抗旱斗争中县委和公社党委的负责同志和社员们一起，吃在地里、住在地里，参加战斗，指挥战斗。在抗旱斗争中，不仅有青年，也有妇女，日夜突击挖泉找水，抢救水稻，还有轰动全社的十八名六十岁以上的老英雄也同时参加战斗。群众的豪言壮语是：
    千军万马齐出征，
    抗旱英雄气死龙；
    尽管到秋不下雨，
    保证卫星上天空。
    在施肥方面，我们那里过去是不习惯施底粪的，外地给我们送了一段顺口溜：“人无厕所猪无圈，牛马没棚满街串，地不上粪是老习惯”。解放后在党的领导下，我们认识到增施底肥对改良土壤、对增加产量的重要性，但是要改变群众多年的习惯，并不是没有思想斗争的。少数人还说什么“大柳树不施肥，长的又高又大；驴尾巴长到粪门上也还是那么粗那么长”。经过党的不断教育和几年来的实践，才改变了过去不施底肥的老习惯，积肥越来越被重视。1959年国家统一平衡化肥，硫铵供应量比往年减少了一半，由过去每亩施硫铵七十斤，降到三十斤左右。有些人又产生了化肥减少产量不能提高的悲观情绪。党委及时发现并批判了这种思想倾向，开展了突击农家肥的群众运动，大搞高温积肥、稻草还田、烧田土、起大坑、扒炕、换锅台、扫烟筒、清猪圈、堆青肥、压绿肥等等，使水田每亩地施肥一万二千斤到一万四千斤。这样，化肥减少了不仅没有减少产量，还使水稻增强抗倒伏的能力，稻粒饱满。过去一麻袋稻子重一百三十斤，1959年超过了一百六十斤；每斤稻子由过去二万二千粒减少到二万粒左右。
    由于施农家肥的好处多，群众的干劲越来越大了，有些老年人也起早贪黑的到处去拣粪。大力积肥也推动了畜牧业的发展。1958年全公社养猪三千七百头，1959年增加到九千多头，这也为今年更大的丰收积攒了大量的粪肥。
    合理密植也是一年来两种思想斗争最尖锐的一个问题，从干部到群众都有不同的认识和不同的主张，一种是：坚决推广1958年已经成功的适合当地情况的每亩四万垵的经验，另一种人主张不密植，要把每亩垵数降低到1957年以前每亩二万垵的水平，其理由是：化肥减少，人力不足，密了费工，插不完秧长不好苗。还有的说：“稀不扔、稀不扔，稀了秋后不能扔；密不了、密不了，密了秋后就抱瓢（讨饭）”。我们针对这两种不同认识开展了全公社范围内全党全民大辩论，用各生产队插秧四万垵，秋后丰产的事例和插两万垵产量不高的事实进行了对比，统一了认识。这样全公社1959年水稻每亩插七万垵以上的有一万亩，五至六万垵的有二万亩，三至四万垵的有六万亩，只有极少数是二万垵左右的，秋后实际明确凡是插二万垵的亩产都没超过四百斤，亩产千斤左右的，绝大部分是密植程度达到五万垵的，用事实给右倾保守思想或别有用心的人一个严厉的打击。
    深翻地是改良盐碱地不可缺少的措施，不论是泡田洗碱或沟河渗碱都必须是深翻的土地。我们公社1958年深翻土地六万余亩，群众总结深翻土地好处是：“深翻好、深翻好，深翻地里无杂草，盐碱危害大减少，害虫病菌冻死了，庄稼生长旺，秋后产量高，今年真得利，明年定大搞”。
    大力推广良种，对1959年增产也起了很大作用。1959年全公社水田95％以上种植“卫国”品种。这个品种是1952年从熊岳城引进二斤种子，在我们地区逐渐普及的。现在这种优良品种每年都大量供应外地，我们现在还在试验几种早熟的品种，在选种方面，我们采用群众选、单穗传，专业人员和广大社员相结合的办法，以培育出更多的优良品种，供应各方面的需要。
    在田间管理上根据几年丰产的经验，我们总结了四句话：“步步抢先，一早百早，不插七月秧，不拔八月草”。1959年插秧比往年提早二十五天，插秧后期又开展一次怎样管好苗的大辩论，群众说，“七月不拔草，水稻长不好，产量不能高，质量不能好”。根据群众的呼声和当时活忙、活多的特点，我们组织了突击锄草，并及时进行了大评比、大检查，这时恰好传达了党的八届八中全会决议，对于反右倾、鼓干劲进一步掀起新的生产高潮，起了巨大的作用。
    秋季又认真贯彻了省、市、县委提出的“九成割，十成收，保证颗粒还家中”的指示。我们对三类不同的稻苗采取一些新的措施，响亮的提出一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上，对三类苗采取“四优先”的办法，即锄草优先、追肥优先、灌水优先、防治病虫害优先，消灭了三类苗、三类地。对发生的稻瘟病和卷叶虫也做到及早发现，及早消灭，保证了稻苗正常生长。
    正是由于我们认真的贯彻了“农业八字宪法”，依靠了人民公社的优越制度，我们才有可能战胜了严重的旱灾，在农业生产上取得了比1958年更大的跃进，提前实现了水网化。1959年的跃进也使我们深刻的认识到，凡是认真贯彻执行毛主席的指示，按照毛主席所指引的方向前进，依靠广大群众，就能够战胜一切困难，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。今后，我们决心更加深入认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，以保证今后取得越来越大的胜利。
