    Saluting Hungarian Workers
    —On Watching the Film "The 39th Brigade"
    Lin Ling
    The Hungarian film "The 39th Brigade" depicts the heroic battles of the Red Army organized by workers to resist the armed intervention of the Entente powers after the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. It fully demonstrates the revolutionary fighting spirit of the Hungarian working class. Its screening during the 15th anniversary of the Hungarian National Day is very meaningful.
    To express respect for the Hungarian workers' struggle against the enemy, Lenin wrote a letter "Salute to the Hungarian Workers" forty-one years ago. In this letter, Lenin not only warmly congratulated the Hungarian working class who had carried out the socialist revolution, established the Soviet Republic, and were heroically fighting against the armed intervention of the Entente powers, but also theoretically and powerfully demonstrated the important principles that the proletariat must establish a dictatorship after seizing power and must adhere to the policy of class struggle. He convincingly explained that "the war of the oppressed against the oppressors, the war of the workers against the exploiters, the war for the victory of socialism" is "the only just, righteous, and truly revolutionary war."
    The Hungarian working class has a rich revolutionary tradition and internationalist spirit. As early as 1868, Hungarian workers established socialist workers' groups and joined the First International; in 1871, they held demonstrations to support the Paris Commune; in 1905, they held large-scale political strikes to support the first Russian revolution; in 1918, they held allied strikes with German and Austrian workers, supporting the October Revolution and opposing the armed intervention of the Soviet Russia by imperialist countries. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the heroic Hungarian workers realized the socialist revolution in 1919, established the Soviet Republic, and launched a war of resistance against intervention to defend their revolutionary achievements. This was an extremely important event in the international revolutionary movement at the time, so Lenin warmly saluted the Hungarian workers.
    The film "The 39th Brigade" is based on the historical facts of the Hungarian Red Army fighting against imperialist troops. The armed interventionists of the Balkan countries, led by French imperialism, launched a frantic attack on the worker's revolutionary regime rising in the heart of Europe. The Hungarian working people armed themselves and fought heroically, enabling the Hungarian Soviet Republic to persist for one hundred and thirty-three days. The situation at that time was very complex and difficult: the World War had just ended, and the economy was exhausted; the revolutionary regime had just been established, and the Social Democrats, who participated in the revolutionary government but still represented the interests of the bourgeoisie, consistently showed vacillation and continuously carried out sabotage activities in politics and military affairs; the newly established Soviet Russian Republic was also besieged by imperialism and unable to support the Hungarian brothers. All these situations are reflected in the intricate struggle depicted in "The 39th Brigade," and the main thread in this complex and difficult struggle is always the firm, courageous, and selfless struggle of the Communists and the working masses who are loyal to the Soviet revolutionary cause.
    The Hungarian revolution, which lasted for one hundred and thirty-three days, had an impact not only on the revolutionary movements in European countries at that time but also on the distant Chinese revolutionary movement. The Russian October Revolution caused a great response in China, and the German and Hungarian revolutions, which occurred directly under the influence of the October Revolution, converged into a torrent of world revolution and had a tremendous impact on China. At that time, progressive newspapers and periodicals in Beijing and Shanghai published lengthy articles introducing and discussing the Hungarian "Red" Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong enthusiastically praised the Hungarian Revolution in the "Xiangjiang Review" (August 4, 1919) in Changsha, describing the world's revolutionary situation and China's revolutionary movement. After narrating the Russian worker-peasant revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong continued: "Hungary rises, and a brand new labor-peasant government has appeared in Budapest. The Germans, Austrians, and Czechs associate with it, striving to fight against the enemy parties in their own countries. The angry waves sweep westward, turning and heading eastward, England, France, Italy, and the United States have staged many large strikes, and India and Korea have launched several major revolutions. A new force rises abruptly, and even more so between the Great Wall and the Bohai Sea in China, the 'May Fourth' Movement has occurred. Banners point southward, crossing the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, Huangpu and Hankou have repeatedly staged live dramas, and Dongting and Minjiang have even set off a high tide, the world is revived, and the treacherous are turned away."
    In "On New Democracy," written by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1940, when talking about the May Fourth Movement, he also mentioned the Hungarian Revolution: "...The Russian proletariat has already established a socialist state, and the proletariat of Germany, Austria (Hungary), and Italy are in revolution, thus giving rise to new hopes for China's national liberation."
    The Hungarian working class and laboring people with revolutionary traditions were liberated from German fascist rule on April 4, 1945, with the help of the Soviet army, and quickly established the Hungarian People's Republic. In 1956, imperialist aggressive forces created a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary. The Hungarian laboring people, mainly the working class, carried out a heroic struggle with Soviet assistance, defended the People's Republic, and established the Socialist Workers' Party to lead the country's socialist construction. In Hungary's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, the Chinese people have always given the most enthusiastic assistance. The friendship between China and Hungary is growing day by day. When the Hungarian people celebrate the great festival of the fifteenth anniversary of their liberation with new brilliant achievements on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production, the Chinese people are celebrating with the Hungarian worker brothers with joy and excitement. We warmly salute the Hungarian workers!

    向匈牙利工人致敬
    ——看影片“第三十九旅”
    林陵
    匈牙利影片“第三十九旅”表现1919年匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立后，工人组织红军抗击协约国武装干涉军的英勇战斗，充分显示了匈牙利工人阶级的革命斗争精神，在匈牙利国庆十五周年演出，是很有意义的。
    为了向匈牙利工人的抗敌斗争表示敬意，列宁在四十一年前写了一封“向匈牙利工人致敬”的信。列宁在这一封信里，不仅热烈地祝贺进行了社会主义革命、建立了苏维埃共和国和正在同协约国武装干涉军进行英勇战斗的匈牙利工人阶级，而且在理论上简洁有力地论证了工人取得政权后必须建立无产阶级专政、必须坚持阶级斗争政策的重要原理，令人信服地说明“被压迫者反对压迫者的战争、劳动者反对剥削者的战争，争取社会主义胜利的战争”是“唯一合理的、正义的和真正革命的战争”。
    匈牙利工人阶级富有革命传统和国际主义精神。匈牙利工人远在1868年，就成立社会主义的工人团体，加入第一国际；1871年举行游行示威，支援巴黎公社；1905年举行大规模政治罢工，支持俄国第一次革命；1918年和德奥工人举行同盟罢工，拥护十月革命，反对帝国主义国家武装干涉苏维埃俄罗斯。英勇的匈牙利工人在共产党领导下，1919年实现了社会主义革命，建立了苏维埃共和国，并且展开了保卫自己革命果实的反干涉战争。这是当时国际革命运动中的极其重大的事件，所以列宁非常热烈地向匈牙利工人致敬。
    影片“第三十九旅”就是取材匈牙利红军对帝国主义军队作战的史实。以法帝国主义为首的巴尔干各国的武装干涉者，向崛起在欧洲心脏地区的工人革命政权疯狂进攻，匈牙利劳动人民武装起来，英勇奋战，使匈牙利苏维埃共和国坚持了一百三十三天。当时的形势是非常复杂和艰苦的：世界大战刚结束，经济枯竭；革命政权刚建立，参加革命政府但仍旧代表资产阶级利益的社会民主党，在政治和军事上始终表现动摇和不断进行破坏活动；刚成立的苏维埃俄罗斯共和国也遭到帝国主义的围攻，无法支援匈牙利兄弟。这一切情况都表现在“第三十九旅”所描写的错综复杂的斗争中，而在这复杂艰苦的斗争中的一条主线，始终是共产党人、工人群众忠于苏维埃革命事业的坚强勇敢的忘我斗争。
    坚持了一百三十三天的匈牙利革命，不仅对当时欧洲各国的革命运动，也对遥远的中国革命运动发生影响。俄国十月革命在中国引起了极大的反响，直接在十月革命影响下发生的德国、匈牙利的革命，汇成一股世界革命的洪流，对中国发生巨大的影响。当时北京、上海的进步报刊都发表长文介绍和论述匈牙利的“红色”革命，毛泽东同志在长沙“湘江评论”（1919年8月4日）上描绘世界的革命形势和中国的革命运动，热情地歌颂了匈牙利革命。在叙述了俄国的工农革命之后，毛泽东同志接着说：“匈牙利崛起，布达佩斯又出现了崭新的劳农政府。德人奥人捷克人和之，出死力以与其国内的敌党搏战。怒涛西迈，转而东行，英法意美既演了多少的大罢工，印度、朝鲜又起了若干的大革命。异军特起，更有中华长城渤海之间，发生了‘五四’运动。旌旗南向，过黄河而到长江，黄浦汉皋，屡演活剧，洞庭闽水，更起高潮，天地为之昭苏，奸邪为之辟易。”
    毛泽东同志在1940年所写的“新民主主义论”里，在谈到五四运动时，也提到了匈牙利革命：“……俄国无产阶级已经建立了社会主义国家，德、奥（匈牙利）意三国无产阶级在革命中，因而发生了中国民族解放的新希望。”
    具有革命传统的匈牙利工人阶级和劳动人民1945年4月4日在苏联军队帮助下，从德国法西斯统治下解放出来，很快地就建立了匈牙利人民共和国。1956年帝国主义侵略势力在匈牙利制造反革命叛乱，以工人阶级为主的匈牙利劳动人民在苏联援助下，进行了英勇的斗争，保卫住了人民共和国，并成立社会主义工人党来领导全国社会主义建设。在匈牙利的革命斗争和社会主义建设事业中，中国人民始终给予最热情的援助，中匈友谊与日俱增，当匈牙利人民用自己在工农业生产战线上的新的光辉成就来庆祝自己解放十五周年的伟大节日的时候，中国人民是怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情来和匈牙利工人兄弟一同庆祝的，我们热烈地向匈牙利工人致敬！
