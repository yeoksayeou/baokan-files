Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Nearly 5,000 activists and representatives of advanced collectives in central authorities’ institutional affairs work held a grand vow meeting yesterday and today at the Great Hall of the People. The meeting called on these "unsung heroes" of socialist construction to summon even greater drive and strive for better and more comprehensive leaps forward in vigorously promoting technical revolution, organizing economic life in institutions, and carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The meeting began on the afternoon of the 13th and closed this afternoon. Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun spoke at the meeting. Twenty-four representatives of advanced workers and advanced collectives in institutional affairs work reported on their advanced achievements. These included outstanding individuals from various fields such as chefs, childcare workers, car drivers, typists, telephone operators, and general affairs section chiefs. Their outstanding achievements in ordinary positions were warmly welcomed by the delegates present.

During the meeting, the central authorities' institutional affairs departments sent representatives to form a "good news reporting team" of more than 300 people to report good news to the meeting. The meeting commended advanced workers and advanced collectives from various units. At the end of the meeting, all the representatives, amid warm applause, adopted a letter of proposal.

In his speech, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun extended warm congratulations to the advanced individuals present. He said that the situation in our country is very good. In recent years, institutional affairs work has achieved great results. Whether in increasing production and practicing economy, developing institutional production, afforestation and greening, organizing cadres to participate in physical labor, or in running collective welfare undertakings and providing services, the tasks assigned by the Party have been successfully completed and the work has been opened up. More importantly, through institutional affairs work, political and ideological work has been further strengthened, and the broad masses on the institutional affairs work front have been mobilized. The achievements have laid a solid foundation for the continued leap forward in institutional affairs work in the future.

Xi Zhongxun said that institutional affairs work is an indispensable aspect of socialist construction, a component and screw in the entire national construction machine, and also a logistics team related to the work and life of institutions. Comrades who undertake this work can be called unsung heroes of our socialist construction. Their labor is glorious labor and respectable labor, work that, like other work, has political significance, and is promising work needed by the Party and the country; there is no difference in rank or status.

Xi Zhongxun spoke about the main tasks of central authorities’ institutional affairs work in 1960, which are to vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, organize the economic life of institutions, vigorously develop collective welfare undertakings, vigorously promote hygiene and sports activities, and vigorously promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

He said that in institutional affairs work, vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution should also, without exception, vigorously promote mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. It must be admitted that a large amount of manual labor is still used in institutional affairs work. He emphasized that technical innovation and technical revolution must be considered from a political perspective, that is, they must be both red and expert, and not just expert but not red. We must liberate our thinking, break superstitions, eliminate feelings of inferiority, establish ambition, set high goals, and scale peaks. Some institutional affairs work cannot be reformed technically, so improvements should be made in work methods, work styles, and service attitudes, and these should be combined with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to promote the sustained development of the movement.

Xi Zhongxun particularly pointed out that organizing the economic life of institutions and vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings is a very complex and meticulous task. At present, organizing the economic life of institutions mainly involves establishing kindergartens and nurseries, running institutional canteens, promoting collective household labor for cadres, and organizing extracurricular collective activities for students. Running public canteens well is the central task of organizing the economic life of institutions and vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings. To run public canteens well, we must strengthen leadership and rely on the masses.

Xi Zhongxun said that vigorously promoting the patriotic health campaign and carrying out various sports activities is a major issue related to the vital interests of the broad masses and socialist construction, and it is also an important task for improving the lives of cadres in institutions. A revolutionary worker must not only have a high degree of political consciousness and work enthusiasm, but also a strong body and good hygiene habits. Only people who are ideologically advanced and physically strong can undertake the arduous tasks assigned by the Party.

Xi Zhongxun said that in vigorously promoting the campaign to increase production and practice economy, we must resolutely implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift. Increasing production and practicing economy is what is usually called increasing income and reducing expenditure. Comrades who do institutional affairs work must learn to do this well. Increasing production and practicing economy should focus on the big picture, start with the small details, mobilize the masses, go deep into reality, find the key, think of ways, and improve work efficiency to save all possible manpower, materials, and financial resources.

At the beginning of the meeting, Gao Dengbang, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, reported on the continuous leap forward in central authorities’ institutional affairs work in recent two years and the main tasks for 1960. He said that under the leadership of the Party, inspired by the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, central authorities’ institutional affairs work has achieved remarkable results and ushered in a vibrant situation of a leap forward.

In the past two years, the production of non-staple foods in central authorities has greatly developed, and various institutions have generally established non-staple food production bases. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of 1959, various institutions had more than 24,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 26,000 pigs, and supplied institutions with more than 790,000 jin of various meats and eggs. In 1959, more than 14 million jin of various crops were harvested. In terms of afforestation and greening, last year completed three years' worth of tasks, planting more than 7.57 million trees, with a survival rate of over 80%.

Gao Dengbang said that with the comprehensive leap forward in institutional affairs work, the mental outlook of cadres in institutional affairs departments has undergone profound changes, and their communist consciousness has been further improved. Many comrades work selflessly, tirelessly, diligently, and without fear of difficulties. This spirit should be greatly promoted in the future. Then, Gao Dengbang spoke about the tasks of central authorities’ institutional affairs work this year.

Gong Zirong, Deputy Director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Party Committee of Central Government Departments, congratulated the "housekeepers" who are loved by the masses on their achievements on behalf of the Party Committee of Central Government Departments. He pointed out that to achieve a great leap forward in institutional affairs work, we must vigorously promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. This movement is a production movement and also a mass ideological movement. Experience has proven that by firmly grasping political and ideological work in the movement, we can enable the workers to carry out ideological revolution while carrying out technical revolution, thereby continuously deepening the technical revolution movement.

Gong Zirong said that institutional affairs workers must, under the leadership of the Party, become the organizers of the lives of the workers in the institutions, and they should regard this glorious task as the direction of institutional affairs work, and not become short-sighted, passively acting institutional affairs workers. In addition, Gong Zirong also talked about the fact that comrades doing institutional affairs work must promote the communist spirit of unity and cooperation, oppose departmentalism; and constantly oppose bureaucracy, maintain close ties with the broad masses, and become "housekeepers" who are loved by the masses.

The meeting adopted a letter of proposal, calling on all comrades in central authorities’ institutional affairs work to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish ambition, set high goals, eliminate any sense of inferiority and lazy cowardice, scale peaks in various tasks, and excellently complete all the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country. First of all, we must immediately launch a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and strive to quickly realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking tools, institutional production tools, and other life service tools in a short period of time, and further develop towards automation and semi-automation. For work that cannot be technically reformed, we must also break superstitions, liberate our thinking, vigorously improve work methods, work styles, and service attitudes, improve work efficiency, and improve service quality. Second, we must vigorously organize the economic life of institutions and vigorously develop collective welfare undertakings. We must make the greatest efforts to run public canteens well, to achieve "mechanized cooking utensils, scientific management, and diversified meals", to ensure that everyone eats well, and at the same time, comprehensively organize the lives of cadres in institutions, and vigorously develop institutional production centered on pig raising and vegetable growing. Third, we must vigorously promote the patriotic health campaign and sports activities. Fourth, vigorously promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy, resolutely implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, promote the fine traditions of our Party of hard work and thrift, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy.

Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, said at the end of the meeting that this meeting will further inspire the revolutionary spirit of all comrades in institutional affairs work and promote the continued leap forward in institutional affairs work. Comrades doing institutional affairs work must adhere to putting politics in command, love their work ideologically; actively promote advanced experiences, promote the communist style of collaboration; comprehensively realize the four proposals, continue to promote the spirit of working hard and diligently serving the institutions, and always be an advanced institutional affairs worker.

    中央机关事务工作跃进誓师大会号召机关事务工作者
    做建设事业的后勤英雄
    目前要大搞技术革新、组织经济生活和大办集体福利事业
    新华社14日讯　中央机关事务工作方面近五千名积极分子和先进集体代表，昨天和今天在人民大会堂举行盛大的跃进誓师大会。大会号召这些社会主义建设事业中的“无名英雄”，鼓足更大的干劲，在大搞技术革命、组织机关经济生活、开展增产节约运动等方面，争取更好更全面的跃进。
    大会在13日下午开始，今天下午闭幕。国务院副总理习仲勋在会上讲了话。有二十四位机关事务工作先进工作者和先进集体的代表，在会上报告了他们的先进事绩，其中有厨师、保育员、汽车司机、打字员、电话班长、总务科长等各方面的先进人物，他们在平凡的岗位上做出的优异成绩，受到了到会代表的热烈欢迎。
    大会过程中，中央机关的事务部门派出代表组成三百多人的报喜队，向大会报喜。大会表扬了各单位的先进工作者和先进集体。会议最后，全体代表在热烈的掌声中通过了倡议书。
    习仲勋副总理在讲话中向到会的先进人物表示热烈的祝贺。他说，当前我们国家的形势好得很。几年来，机关事务工作的成绩是很大的，无论是在增产节约方面，或是在发展机关生产，绿化造林和组织干部参加体力劳动方面，也无论是在举办集体福利事业和服务招待等等方面，都胜利地完成了党所交给的任务，工作的局面打开了。更重要的是，通过事务工作，进一步加强了政治工作和思想工作，把机关事务工作战线上的广大群众发动起来了。这些成绩的获得，也为今后机关事务工作的持续跃进，打下了扎实的基础。
    习仲勋说，机关事务工作是社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的一个方面，是整个国家建设机器中的一个部件和螺丝钉，也是一支关系到机关工作和生活的后勤队伍。担负这些工作的同志，可以称得起是我们社会主义建设事业中的无名英雄，他们的劳动都是光荣的劳动，也是受人尊敬的劳动，是同其他工作一样具有政治意义的工作，是党和国家所需要的大有可为的工作；丝毫没有高低贵贱的不同。
    习仲勋谈到1960年中央机关事务工作的主要任务，就是大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，组织机关经济生活和大搞集体福利事业，大搞卫生和体育活动，大搞增产节约运动，等等。
    他说，在机关事务工作中，大搞技术革新技术革命运动，也应当无例外地大搞机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化。必须承认，在机关事务工作中，大量耗费体力的手工操作是存在的。他强调搞技术革新和技术革命，必须注意从政治出发，也就是既要红，又要专，不能只专不红。必须解放思想，破除迷信，去掉自卑感，要树雄心，立大志，攀高峰。在机关事务工作中还有一部分不能搞技术改革的，应当从工作方法、工作作风和服务态度等方面加以改进，并且同技术革新和技术革命运动结合起来，以促进运动的持续开展。
    习仲勋特别指出，组织机关的经济生活，大办集体福利事业，这是一件十分复杂细致的工作。目前组织机关的经济生活，主要是大办幼儿园托儿所，大办机关食堂，大搞干部家务集体劳动，大搞学生课余集体活动。办好公共食堂又是组织机关经济生活，大办集体福利事业的中心内容。要办好公共食堂，必须加强领导，依靠群众。
    习仲勋谈到大搞爱国卫生运动，开展各种各样的体育活动时说，这是关系到广大群众的切身利益和社会主义建设的大问题，也是搞好机关干部生活的一项重要工作。一个革命工作者，不仅要有高度的政治觉悟和工作的积极性，而且还必须有强健的身体和良好的卫生习惯。只有思想进步，而又身体强健的人，才能够担负起党所交给的繁重的工作任务。
    习仲勋谈到大搞增产节约运动时说，要坚决贯彻勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业的方针。增产节约也就是通常所说的开源节流。做机关事务工作的同志必须学会做好这一方面的工作。增产节约要从大处着眼，小处下手，要发动群众，深入实际，找窍门，想办法，提高工作效率，节省一切可以节省的人力、物力和财力。
    会议开始时，国务院副秘书长高登榜在会上报告了两年来中央机关事务工作连续跃进的情况和1960年的主要工作任务。他说，中央机关事务工作在党的领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，获得了显著的成绩，出现了生气蓬勃的跃进局面。
    两年来，中央机关的副食品生产有了很大发展，各机关普遍建立了副食品生产基地。据不完全统计，到1959年底，各机关拥有耕地二万四千多亩，猪二万六千多头，供应机关各种肉类蛋品七十九万多斤。1959年收获各种农作物一千四百多万斤。在绿化造林方面，去年一年完成了三年的任务，植树七百五十七万多株，成活率达到80％以上。
    高登榜说，随着机关事务工作的全面跃进，机关事务部门干部的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，共产主义觉悟有了进一步的提高。许多同志不计报酬，不怕困难，勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨地工作，今后这种精神应该大大发扬。接着，高登榜谈了今年中央机关事务工作的任务。
    中共中央办公厅副主任、中央国家机关党委第一书记龚子荣在讲话中，代表中央国家机关党委向这些为群众所爱戴的“管家人”所取得的成绩，表示热烈祝贺。他指出，要想取得机关事务工作的大跃进，就必须大搞技术革新和技术革命运动。这个运动是一个生产运动，也是群众性的思想运动。经验证明，在运动中紧紧抓住政治思想工作，就能够使职工群众在技术革命中，同时进行思想革命，从而也使技术革命运动不断地深入发展。
    龚子荣说，机关事务工作人员必须在党的领导下，成为机关职工群众生活的组织者，要把这个光荣的任务当作机关事务工作的方向，不要变成鼠目寸光消极被动的事务工作者。另外，龚子荣还谈到做事务工作的同志，必须发扬团结协作的共产主义精神，反对本位主义思想；要经常不断地反对官僚主义，做到和广大群众息息相关，成为群众所爱戴的“管家人”。
    大会通过倡议书，号召中央机关事务工作全体同志，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，树雄心，立大志，破除任何自卑感和懒汉懦夫思想，在各项工作上攀登高峰，出色地完成党和国家交给我们的一切任务。首先要立即掀起一个技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮，力争在较短的时间内迅速实现炊事工具、机关生产工具和其他生活服务工具的机械化、半机械化，并进一步向自动化、半自动化发展。对于不能搞技术改革的工作，也要破除迷信，解放思想，大力改进工作方法、工作作风和服务态度，提高工作效率，提高服务质量。第二、要大力组织机关经济生活，大办集体福利事业。要尽最大的努力办好公共食堂，做到
  “炊具机械化，管理科学化，饭菜多样化”，保证大家吃得好，同时还要全面组织机关干部的生活，大力发展以养猪和种菜为中心的机关生产。第三、要大搞爱国卫生运动和体育活动。第四、大搞增产节约运动，坚决贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，发扬我们党的艰苦朴素、克勤克俭的优良传统，反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义。
    国务院副秘书长齐燕铭在大会结束时讲话说，这次大会将进一步鼓舞全体机关事务工作同志的革命干劲，推动机关事务工作继续跃进。做事务工作的同志必须坚持政治挂帅，从思想上热爱自己的工作；要积极推广先进经验，大兴共产主义协作之风；要全面地实现四项倡议，继续发扬埋头苦干勤勤恳恳为机关服务的工作精神，永远做一个先进的机关事务工作者。（附图片）
