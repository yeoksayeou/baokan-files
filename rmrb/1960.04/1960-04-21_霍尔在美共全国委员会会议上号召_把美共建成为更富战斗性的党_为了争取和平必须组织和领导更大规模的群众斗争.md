Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: According to the American "Worker's Weekly" report on the 17th, the National Committee of the Communist Party USA held a meeting in Chicago from March 24th to 26th. The "Worker's Weekly" said that the meeting "marks another step forward in restoring the party's role in the great people's movement unfolding in our country (referring to the United States)," and the meeting "demonstrated the party's increasing activity in mass movements and further strengthened the party's unity." After discussions, the meeting "reached a general consensus on important policies and guidelines."

The General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, Hall, delivered a keynote report on the 1960 American elections and the work of the party. He pointed out that the United States is heading towards a sharp turning point in its world affairs and domestic affairs. The United States is in a declining stage of an era in which it has relied mainly on the plunder by monopoly capitalists from wars and post-war devastation to achieve special development.

Hall said: "Many signs indicate a new downturn in our economy." We have seen "a growing army of long-term unemployed, economic blight in vast areas, and inhumane speed-up systems." Accompanying these changes is a surge in mass struggles. Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are also thawing. But American monopoly capitalists are resisting change. Hall said they "have taken hypocritical, irresponsible, and predatory actions on disarmament issues and are following a dangerous policy of rebuilding nests of destructive forces in Japan and West Germany." Therefore, in order to win peace, larger-scale mass struggles and mass movements must be carried out. "Peace will not be easily obtained from objective developments."

In discussing the upcoming American elections, Hall sharply attacked the American presidential candidates Nixon and Kennedy. He called on free and progressive forces to unite on candidates and campaign platforms. He said that in order to achieve such unity, grassroots activities are needed, which are developing and will be developed under the stimulation of the Black movement and other movements, the highest-level meeting and other domestic and international situations. Hall said that therefore our central task in the elections and in the overall situation is: to organize and lead mass movements around specific issues.

The National Secretary of the Communist Party USA, Davis, delivered a report on the Black movement at the meeting. He said that the Black people's struggle for equality has entered a new stage. This stage is characterized by broader mass participation, new militant methods of struggle (sit-ins, marches, and demonstrations), and increasing support from whites and labor. The "Worker's Weekly" pointed out in its report that a major feature of the meeting was attention to the party's organizational work and newspaper work. Bart, the CPUSA's organizational secretary, emphasized that the leadership must focus on the party's grassroots organizations as the main organizational work.

The meeting pointed out that the second part of the work of building the party is to insist on strengthening the defense of the party and the party's leadership, and to strive for the immediate release of Winston and the pardon of Thompson and Green.

In his concluding remarks at the meeting, Hall called for building the CPUSA into a more militant political party. He said, "We are a growing part of a growing movement, and we are breaking through the isolation of the past." Hall said that we must have great ambitions. We must rectify the party and the party's style of work, we must possess greater revolutionary enthusiasm and self-sacrifice, we must strengthen the direct links between the leadership and the party members, and we must further consider eliminating the influence of the past—the infiltration of petty-bourgeois ways into our work, thoughts, and attitudes.

    霍尔在美共全国委员会会议上号召
    把美共建成为更富战斗性的党
    为了争取和平必须组织和领导更大规模的群众斗争
    据新华社19日讯　据美国“工人周报”17日报道，美国共产党全国委员会3月24日到26日在芝加哥举行了会议。“工人周报”说，这次会议“标志着在我国（指美国）展开的伟大的人民运动中恢复党的作用方面又前进了一步”，会议“说明了党在群众运动中的活动不断增加，党的团结进一步增强”。会议经过讨论后，“在重要的方针和政策上取得了总的一致的意见”。
    美国共产党总书记霍尔在会上作了关于1960年美国选举和党的工作的主要报告。他指出，美国在它的世界事务和国内事务中正在走向一个急剧的转折点。美国正处在一个时代的没落的阶段，在这个时代里，美国曾经主要依靠垄断资本家从战争和战后的严重破坏中进行的掠夺而得到特殊的发展。
    霍尔说：“许多迹象指明我国经济出现了新的下降。”我们已经看到“一支日益增长的长期失业的大军、广大地区的经济枯萎以及惨无人道的赶快制度。”随着这些改变而来的是群众斗争的高涨。美国和苏联的关系也正在解冻。但是美国垄断资本家正在抵抗改变。霍尔说，他们“在裁军问题上采取了两面派的、不负责任的、强盗式的行动，而且遵循在日本和西德重建毁灭力量巢穴的危险方针”。因此，为了争取和平，必须进行更大规模的群众斗争和群众运动。“和平是不会从客观发展中很容易地得到的”。
    霍尔在谈到即将到来的美国选举的情况时尖锐地抨击了美国下一届总统竞选人尼克松和肯尼迪。他要求自由和进步力量在候选人和竞选纲领问题上团结一致。他说，为了实现这种团结一致，需要基层活动，这种活动正在发展，而且将在黑人运动和其他运动、在最高级会议和其他国内外局势发展的激励下得到发展。霍尔说，因此我们在选举中和总的局势中的中心任务是：围绕着具体问题来组织和领导群众运动。
    美国共产党全国书记戴维斯在会上作了关于黑人运动的报告。他说，黑人争取平等的斗争已经进入一个新的阶段。这一阶段的特征是参加的群众更广泛，斗争采取了新的战斗性方法（静坐、游行和示威），白人和劳工的支持日益增加。“工人周报”在报道中指出，会议的一个主要特点是注意党的组织工作和报纸工作。美共组织书记巴特强调指出，领导必须集中力量注意党的基层组织，以此作为主要的组织工作。
    会议指出，建设党的工作的第二部分是坚持加强保卫党和党的领导，争取立即释放温斯顿和赦免汤普森及格林。
    霍尔在会议上作总结发言时号召把美共建成一个更富战斗性的政党。他说，“我们是一个日益发展的运动中的一个日益发展的部分，我们正在冲破过去的孤立状态。”霍尔说，我们必须目光远大。我们必须整顿党和党的工作作风，必须具备更大的革命热情和自我牺牲精神，必须加强领导和党员之间的直接联系，还必须进一步考虑消除过去的影响——小资产阶级方式对我们的工作、思想和态度的渗入。
