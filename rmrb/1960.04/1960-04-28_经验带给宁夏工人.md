    Experience Brings Benefits to Ningxia Workers
    I am so happy to be able to come to Ningxia to support construction this time.
    Ningxia needs some experienced workers to provide technical guidance, giving me another opportunity to contribute to the country. How could I not come? I am a heating furnace operator in the steel rolling workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2. Judging the fire color for discharging the furnace is a crucial key to steel rolling. If the steel ingot temperature is too high, it will break when it comes out; if the temperature is not enough, it cannot be rolled. This time in Ningxia, I will definitely share all my decades of experience in firing with the young workers.
    Recently, our factory has also been vigorously carrying out technical revolution. From loading the furnace to the final sorting of the rolled steel, everything has been automated. We have also experimented with using coal dust to fire the heating furnace, which can save coal. I will also teach these new experiences to the steel rolling workers in Ningxia.

    经验带给宁夏工人
    这次能到宁夏来支援建设，我太高兴了。
    宁夏需要一些老工人作技术指导，使我又能有为国家出力的机会，我还能不来吗？我在上钢二厂轧钢车间是烧加热炉的。看准火色出炉是轧钢的一个重要关键，钢锭温度烧过火出来就断了，温度要是不够就轧不动。这回到宁夏，我一定把我几十年烧火的经验，全部告诉给青年工人。
    最近我们厂里还大闹技术革命，从装炉到最后整理轧好的钢材，全部实现了自动化，还试验了用煤末烧加热炉，能节省煤炭。这些新经验我也要教给宁夏的轧钢工人。
