Comrade Delegates:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

I am a fitter from the Huainan Mining Machinery Factory in Anhui Province. I am extremely excited and moved to be able to speak at this solemn meeting. There is so much to say that I couldn't finish even in three days and three nights. Here, I will only talk about what I have done under the Party's education in recent years.

I grew up in a poor peasant family, suffering from cold and hunger since childhood. At the age of sixteen, I left my hometown to fend for myself, enduring all kinds of hardships. After the national liberation, I also turned over. It was the Party that brought me a new life. Looking back at the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future, I cannot help but feel immense hatred for the old society, and at the same time, it makes me love the new society even more.

Over the past ten years, the Party has transformed me from an unskilled machine worker into a seventh-grade technician, and from an illiterate person into a student in the preparatory class of the Mechanical Engineering Department of a spare-time industrial university. I am now a glorious Communist Party member. All of this is the result of the education of the Party and our beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

I am constantly thinking: How can I repay the Party and Chairman Mao for their kindness to the working people? How can I contribute all my energy to our great Party and the great cause of socialism and communism? I believe the only way is to dedicate all my energy to adding some bricks and tiles to the edifice of communism. Therefore, I must not only work hard but also strive to work cleverly. Over the years, I have improved a total of 277 tools and operating methods, enabling me to overfulfill the state's production tasks every year. In 1955, I overfulfilled by more than double. In 1956, I overfulfilled by more than triple. In 1957, I completed two and a half years' worth of work in one year. In 1958, inspired by the General Line, I devoted several months to the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production. In these four years, I completed eight years' worth of work. Last year, the Party put forward the great call to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, exert great effort, and wage a great battle in August and September, which further inspired my enthusiasm. In September, I completed the entire month's task in only six days, and completed four years' worth of work for the whole year. At the end of last year, the Party called on us to continue to hold high the red flag of the General Line, achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward, win a flying start in 1960, and achieve redness every month, every quarter, every aspect, and redness to the end. I was full of energy. I thought that the various flower washer parts we often made were oddly shaped. In the past, workers relied on scissors or shovels to cut them first, and then used files to file them. The efficiency was low, the labor intensity was high, and it was very tiring. If they could be punched with a die, it would definitely be better. This prompted me to start experimenting. The first time I used a die to punch them, the result was more than thirty times more efficient than manual operation. Later, I made a set of compound dies, and both the inner hole and the outer circle could be punched out at the same time, and the efficiency was more than doubled. However, after all the modifications, it still required two or three people to use a large hammer, and the labor intensity was still high. At the same time, it was still impossible to punch thicker washers. What to do? Could I stop here? Could I be satisfied because I had already improved the efficiency? No, definitely not. I must face the difficulties and continue to improve. After several days and nights of deep thinking, I finally designed a punching machine program that could self-cut, self-insert, and self-punch. As soon as this program was proposed, it received the support and encouragement of the Party and the workshop leaders. Through the efforts of all the comrades in the group and the assistance of veteran masters of other types of work, the triple-use punching machine was finally successfully manufactured. Now, with only one person, one hand feeding the material and one hand operating the machine, the parts will fall down "ka-cha" "ka-cha", and the efficiency is increased by 648 times. Moreover, the punched washers are regular and smooth. At the same time, I have further promoted the method of punching various iron plates to punch various paper washers, rubber washers, and corrugated gaskets. In this way, the manufacture of washers and corrugated gaskets has basically been mechanized and made die based, and the labor intensity has been reduced. As soon as I started work on January 2nd this year, I used the five types of dies I created to punch 1.6-meter winch corrugated gaskets. As a result, I completed the task that originally required 40 minutes in 1.4 seconds, increasing the efficiency by 1,714 times. From January 2nd to 19th, in the seventeen working days, I completed the work for one year and five and a half days. If calculated according to the original quota, by January 19th, I would have been doing the work for July 1968.

New things always grow and develop in the struggle against old things. Chairman Mao said: "Correct things always develop in the process of struggling against wrong things." Our creations also encountered various kinds of resistance from conservative ideas. For example, when I first experimented with punching rubber washers, some people objected, saying: "Rubber is not like iron plate. It's neither hard nor soft. No one has ever seen it punched with a die." At this time, the Party supported me, encouraged me, and said to me: "There are many things we haven't seen! If we wait for ready-made solutions everywhere, who will fire the first shot?" With the support of the Party, my experiment finally succeeded. It is not enough to simply greatly improve efficiency. High output must also be of high quality. The Party's requirement of "high output must be of high quality" is always in my mind. In production, I am always focused and never distracted. Every time I complete the first piece of work, I always hand it over to the inspector for inspection first. Only after it is qualified do I feel relieved to continue working. I never take tools or look at drawings carelessly. For example, once I was processing a spring on a tipper. The drawing process regulations stipulated that the spring core should be as thick as the inner diameter of the spring. As soon as I looked at it, I knew there was a problem. The spring has elasticity. When it is wound, the two ends are stuck, so it is of course obediently wound on the core, but as soon as it is released, due to the recovery of elasticity, the size will be larger than the drawing. According to my understanding, the diameter of the spring core should be made smaller. It was already late that day, and the designers were not in the office. I thought that I was a Communist Party member and had the responsibility to prevent the property of the motherland from being damaged. Immediately, I found the duty technician and repeatedly studied and re-determined the core size, and made a spring that met the requirements. Later, I learned that the comrade who compiled the process was careless and made a mistake in the size. This batch of parts that was about to be scrapped was stopped by me at the pass. Because I resolutely implemented the requirement of "high output must be of high quality" and constantly improved tools, fixtures, dies, etc., in the past seven years, nearly 300,000 parts processed by me have been qualified and no defective products have been produced.

While achieving high output and high quality, I have also resolutely implemented the Party's policy on safe production. The Party's frequent education on safe production has made me fully aware of the great significance of safe production. I usually strictly abide by safe operating procedures, actively take precautions, and am always vigilant. If my cuffs are not tied properly or I don't grip the hammer tightly, I never work rashly. Therefore, I have maintained more than 2,500 days of safe production without accidents.

I remember that in the early days of liberation, my understanding of attendance was very vague. I thought: "There are many people in the factory. It doesn't matter if one person misses a shift or two." Later, after the Party's education, I gradually reversed this wrong idea, especially after the factory leaders told me: "As long as we increase the attendance rate by 1%, our factory can produce dozens more machines and increase the wealth by more than 100,000 yuan for the country every year." From then on, I never wanted to be absent for a single day. Usually, I pay special attention to my health, so as not to be affected by disasters and diseases, and to create more wealth for the country. In this way, for more than seven years, I have never been late or left early, and I have never taken a shift off, always being fully present.

Revolutionary work cannot be done by one person's strength alone. We must also rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and learn from the masses. "Many people generate great enthusiasm" and "Many hands make light work" are what the Party often educates us. Therefore, I usually care for and unite with comrades politically in the group, and get along well with them. The comrades also help me and work together to complete the production tasks. I always discuss things with everyone and reasonably arrange manpower. According to the nature of the work, I organize assembly line operations. This can not only give full play to the power of the masses but also quickly improve everyone's skills.

The work I do is very ordinary. As a Communist Party member and a soldier in building socialism, I have only done what I should do, but the Party and the people have given me great honor and meticulous care. Since 1953, I have been rated as an advanced producer every year and every quarter, and I have won the glorious title of advanced producer thirty times in a row. Last year, I was also elected as a people's representative and attended the first session of the Second National People's Congress, and I saw our great leader Chairman Mao. Today, I am speaking at the conference again. These honors have given me endless strength and encouragement. Now, I would like to express to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the people of the whole country: In the future, I will definitely exert more effort and work more cleverly, respond to the Party's call, engage in technical revolution in a big way, strive to complete five years of tasks in one year, and contribute all my strength to building our great motherland!

    劲上加劲力争一年完成五年任务
    庞明义代表的发言代表同志们：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。
    我是安徽省淮南矿山机械厂的钳工，能在这个庄严的大会上讲话，心情万分的兴奋激动。要说的话真多，三天三夜也说不完。这里只说说这些年来，我在党的教育下，做了些什么。
    我是生长在贫农的家庭，从小挨冻受饿，十六岁那年，就离乡背井，自找生路，受尽折磨。全国解放了，我也翻了身，是党给我带来了新的生命，回想过去，看看现在，望望将来，不能不引起我对旧社会的无比痛恨，同时也使我要更加热爱新社会。
    十年来，党已把我由一个技术不熟练的机器工人，培养成了七级技工；由只字不识的文盲，培养成了业余工业大学机械系预备班的学生。我现在已是一个光荣的共产党员。所有这一切，是党和敬爱的领袖毛主席教导的结果。
    我时刻在想：怎样来报答党和毛主席对劳动人民的恩情呢？怎样把自己的一切贡献给我们伟大的党，伟大的社会主义和共产主义事业呢？我设想唯一的办法就是竭尽我全部的精力，为共产主义大厦增添一些砖和瓦。因此，我不仅要苦干，更要想法巧干，几年来我改进的工具和操作方法共二百七十七件，使我能够年年超额完成国家生产任务。1955年超额一倍多，1956年超额二倍多，1957年一年完成二年半的工作量，1958年我在总路线的鼓舞下，抽出了几个月的时间大炼钢铁。这四年，我完成了八年的工作量。去年，党提出反右倾，鼓干劲，大战8、9两月的伟大号召，更加鼓舞了我的干劲，9月份只用了六天就完成了全月任务，全年完成了四年的工作量。去年年底，党号召我们要继续高举总路线的红旗，实现持续大跃进，夺得1960年的开门红，并要做到月月红、季季红、满堂红、红到底。我浑身是劲，我就想，咱们经常干的各种花垫圈零件，形状古怪，过去一直靠工人先用剪刀剪或铲子铲，再用锉刀锉，效率低，劳动强度高，非常累人，如果能用冲模冲制一定会好些。这就促使我着手试验。第一次用冲模冲制，结果比手工操作提高效率三十多倍。以后，我又制成一套复合冲模，内孔外圆都可同时冲出，效率又提高一倍多。但是，改来改去还是需要两三个人用大锤打，劳动强度还是重。同时，冲制较厚的垫圈，还是不行，怎么办呢？我能就此停止不前吗？我能因为已提高了效率而满足吗？不能，决不能。我必须迎接困难，继续改进。经过几天几夜的深思苦虑，终于设计出一种能自剪、自插、自冲的冲床方案。这个方案一提出，就得到党和车间领导的支持、鼓励。经过全组同志的努力和其他工种老师傅的援助，三用冲床终于胜利的制成了。现在只要一个人，一手送材料，一手操作机器，零件就会“卡察”“卡察”地掉下来，效率又提高六百四十八倍，而且冲出来的垫圈又规矩又光滑，同时，我又把冲制各种铁板的方法，进一步推广去冲制各种纸垫圈，橡皮垫圈和瓦口垫片。这样，就基本上实现了制造垫圈和瓦口垫片的钳工冲模化、机械化，还减轻了劳动强度。今年元月2号一上班，我就用自己创造的五种冲模来冲一米六绞车瓦口垫，结果，以一秒四的时间完成了原来需要四十分钟的任务，提高工效一千七百一十四倍；从元月2日至19日的十七个工作日中就干完了一年零五天半的工作量。如果按照原来的定额计算，到元月19日止，我就在干1968年7月份的活了。
    新生事物总是在和旧事物的斗争中成长壮大的。毛主席说过：“正确的东西总是在向错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。”我们的创造，同样碰到各种各样保守思想的抵抗。比如，当我最初试验冲橡皮垫圈时，就有人反对说：“橡皮不比铁板，软硬不吃，谁也没有见过能用模子冲的。”这时候，党支持我，鼓舞我，并对我说：“咱们没有见过的东西多着呢！处处等现成，谁来开第一炮呢？”有党的支持，我的试验终于获得成功。仅仅功效大大提高还不行，高产还必须优质，党的“高产必须优质”的要求，在我脑子里一刻也没有忘掉。在生产中，我总是全神贯注，毫不分心。每次干好第一件活总是先交检查员检查，合格后，才放心干下去。每当拿工具，看图纸，也从不马虎草率。比如有一次我加工翻车机上的弹簧，图纸工艺规程规定弹簧芯子和弹簧内径一样粗。我一看，有问题，弹簧有弹性，在缠的时候两头卡死了，当然服服贴贴缠在芯上，可是一松开，由于弹性的恢复，尺寸就要比图纸大了。根据我的领会，应把弹簧芯子的直径车小些才行。当时天已晚了，设计人员又不在办公室。我想我是一个共产党员，有责任不使祖国财产受到损失。马上我就找了值班技术员反复地进行了研究，重新决定了芯子尺寸，制成了符合要求的弹簧。事后了解，原来是编工艺的同志粗心大意，把尺寸搞错了。这一批险将报废的零件，被我在关口上卡住了。由于我坚决贯彻了“高产必须优质”的要求，并不断地改进工具、夹具、冲模等，七年来，经我加工的近三十万个零件，件件合格，没有出过一件废品。
    我在取得高产优质的同时，还坚决地贯彻了党的安全生产方针。党经常进行的安全生产的教育，使我充分的认识了安全生产的重大意义，平时严格遵守安全操作规程，积极防护，时刻警惕，袖口没扎好，鎯头没抓紧，从不冒冒失失的干活。因此保持了二千五百多天安全生产无事故。
    记得还是刚解放的初期，我对出勤的认识十分模糊的，认为：“工厂里人多着啦，一个人耽误个把班没有什么”。后来，经过了党的教育，使我逐渐地扭转这种错误的想法，特别是厂里领导告诉我：“只要把出勤率提高1％，我们工厂每年就能为国家多生产几十台机器，增产十万多元的财富”。从那时起，我再也不愿缺一天勤。平时，我特别注意身体健康，不要为生灾害病影响生产，好给国家多创造财富。就是这样，七年多来，我从未迟到早退，更未歇过一班，一直满勤。
    革命工作，光凭一个人的力量是不行的，还必须依靠群众，走群众路线，向群众学习，“人多热气大”“众人拾柴火焰高”这是党经常教育我们的。因此，平时我在小组里就从政治上关心和团结同志，和他们融洽一致，同志们也帮助我，共同努力完成生产任务。我有事总是多和大家商量，并合理的安排人力，根据工作性质，组织流水作业，这样既能充分发挥群众的力量，也能更快提高大家的技术。
    我做的工作，是十分平凡的。作为一个共产党员，一个建设社会主义的战士来说，只不过是做了自己应做的一份事，可是党和人民却给了我极大的荣誉和无微不至的关怀。从1953年起，我每年每季都评为先进生产者，连获三十次先进生产者的光荣称号，去年，又被选为人民代表，出席了第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。今天又在大会上发言。这些荣誉，给了我无穷力量和鼓舞。现在，我向党、向毛主席、向全国人民表示：今后我一定劲上加劲，巧上加巧，响应党的号召，大搞技术革命，力争一年完成五年任务，为建设我们伟大的祖国贡献出我的全部力量！
