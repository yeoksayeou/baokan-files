Building Factories Along Rivers: Fully Utilizing Water Transport
Vice Minister of Communications, Sun Daguang

I.

In the new stage of socialist construction in our country, with the comprehensive and continuous leap-forward development of the national economy, a large number of new cities and industrial bases are increasing, and various large, medium, and small factories, mines, and enterprises are springing up like mushrooms. The volume of commodity circulation and material exchange is growing rapidly. As a leading sector of the national economy, the transportation industry must develop at a correspondingly high speed to ensure and promote the smooth progress of production and construction.

In the past two years, China's transportation industry has developed more rapidly. The growth rate of freight volume in various modes of transportation has been higher than the average growth rate of industrial and agricultural production, basically ensuring the transportation requirements of the great leap forward in production and construction. However, at present, the phenomenon of backlog of passengers and goods continues to appear in many areas. Various modes of transportation still cannot fully meet objective needs, and the transportation industry remains a weak link in the current national economy.

In order to accelerate the development of the transportation industry, the state has increased the proportion of investment in transportation in this year's capital construction plan, so as to adapt transportation to the needs of continued leap forward in production and construction. At the same time, the broad masses of workers in the national transportation sector are also extensively and deeply carrying out mass movements of technological innovation, technological revolution, and "one-dragon" transportation collaboration. This has already and will continue to play a huge role in rapidly increasing transportation capacity and maximizing the satisfaction of the national economy's requirements for transportation. However, to completely change the backward state of transportation, we must strengthen the construction of transportation from many aspects. We must take railways as the key and gradually build a transportation network that combines water, land, and air transportation, is based on modern transportation tools, and extends in all directions. In particular, we must make overall arrangements for transportation construction from the perspective of industrial layout.

Judging from the transportation situation in some areas, the failure to comprehensively arrange internal and external transportation conditions in the construction planning of some factories and mines in the past has already brought some difficulties to the development of enterprise production. Conversely, some factories and mines have been able to comprehensively utilize various transportation tools and effectively strengthen leadership over transportation work because they have fully paid attention to transportation issues in their construction planning. Therefore, transportation work has greatly promoted the leap forward in production and construction. This raises an extremely important issue for us, namely, "Full attention must be paid to transportation conditions in factory and mine construction; The layout of transportation must be considered simultaneously when considering the industrial layout." This is also one of the important experiences of economic construction in the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. Especially in the current new situation of the comprehensive and continuous great leap forward in China's national economy, the development of all undertakings must be both at a high speed and proportionate. This puts forward a more urgent task for planning work and related economic management departments: We must proceed from the overall and long-term interests of the national economy, and from the most adequate and economical use of national natural resources and productive forces, to rationally arrange the regional distribution of industrial capital construction. The industrial layout should be close to the sources of raw materials, fuel, and consumption areas, and be suitable for consolidating national defense conditions; based on the natural and economic conditions of various regions, rational division of labor and close cooperation should be carried out to gradually build an independent and complete economic system within the country.

Marx once said: "The transportation industry...it appears as a continuation of the production process in the circulation process." (Note 1) Lenin also pointed out that the transportation industry is the material pillar connecting industrial and agricultural production. In his "Speech at the All-Russian Congress of Transport Workers," he said: "What is the material pillar connecting industry and agriculture? It is railway transportation and water transportation." (Note 2) These brilliant arguments by Marx and Lenin fully demonstrate the important position and role of the transportation industry in the national economy. Our practical experience and understanding also fully prove that the relationship between transportation and production is very close: all places with production and consumption cannot be separated from transportation, and the transportation industry is the link connecting production and consumption; production and construction cannot take a step without transportation; production drives transportation, and transportation promotes production, and the two are dialectical relationships. In our production and transportation work, we emphasize establishing the idea of the whole country as a chessboard and vigorously promoting the experience of "one-dragon" cooperation between production, transportation, and sales. In the construction of new factories and mines, we should pay full attention to the close combination and rational arrangement of production and transportation. Correctly solving the combined problem of industrial construction layout and transportation construction layout is one of the very important guiding and strategic issues in socialist economic construction.

II.

Chairman Mao wrote in the book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "Our China is one of the largest countries in the world,...there are many rivers and lakes, which give us the benefit of boats and irrigation; there is a very long coastline, which gives us the convenience of communicating with overseas nations." (Note 3) The Chinese nation with a long history has gradually developed and prospered in the river basins of the Yellow River and Yangtze River and along the coastal areas. China's water resources are extremely rich, and water transport conditions are very superior: The country has more than 5,000 natural rivers with a total length of 420,000 kilometers, more than 900 lakes of various sizes, and water systems such as the Heilongjiang River, the Yellow River, and the Pearl River. In particular, the Yangtze River, one of the four largest rivers in the world, runs across the middle of China, with a length of 5,800 kilometers and a navigable mileage of more than 60,000 kilometers of its trunk and tributaries. The downstream water is deep and the flow is gentle, allowing 5,000-ton seagoing vessels to pass through. In addition, there is the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which is more than 1,500 kilometers long, passes through the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, and connects the Haihe River, the Yellow River, the Huaihe River, the Yangtze River, and the Qiantang River. It has a long history and is famous throughout the world. China is located in the temperate zone, and most of its rivers and lakes do not freeze all year round, allowing navigation in all seasons. The mainland coastline is about 12,000 kilometers long, with many excellent seaports and river ports, which are important hubs for the development of water transportation and water-land combined transportation. There are countless canyons that can be built into huge reservoirs and power stations. The two sides of the large rivers are generally either plains rich in grain and cotton or mountainous areas rich in mineral deposits, and therefore are also important areas for the country's industrial and agricultural production and construction.

Building factories and mines is to develop and process the country's natural resources, and fully developing and utilizing water resources has the same significance as the development and utilization of resources such as coal, iron, oil, non-ferrous metals, and forests. Therefore, in industrial layout and factory and mine construction, fully considering the development of water conservancy, the utilization of water transport, and making industries close to power sources and transportation arteries is completely in line with the overall interests of the national economy.

In the ten years since liberation, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction under the correct leadership of the Party. The network of rivers and canals in the plains has developed rapidly, and projects to renovate and develop river channels for transportation are being actively carried out in conjunction with the construction of farmland water conservancy and the mass movement for short-distance transportation. Large-scale water conservancy hubs such as Sanmenxia and Xin'anjiang are under construction. In the future, under such superior natural conditions and the favorable situation of vigorously developing water conservancy construction, we should consider building factories along rivers as much as possible to fully utilize the country's water resources and give full play to the superior conditions of water transportation.

Building factories along rivers can fully utilize the large and cheap water transport capacity. Because a large factory, mine, or industrial base has an annual transportation volume of hundreds or even tens of millions of tons, such a huge transportation task cannot be fully met by only one mode of transportation. In fact, any mode of transportation has certain limitations. Often, when one mode of transportation is subject to seasonal restrictions, it is when another mode of transportation can give full play to its strengths. If there is only one mode of transportation, it is easy to form a saturated state of line congestion or the inability of ports and stations to meet the throughput capacity when transportation tasks increase sharply or certain changes occur in objective conditions, and even cause the phenomenon of production and transportation being disconnected. If there are conditions to utilize water transport, increasing a mode of transportation can greatly reduce the pressure on land transportation, and can give full play to the advantages of water transportation in the comprehensive utilization of various modes of transportation.

On a river, numerous ships can sail at the same time. A medium-sized fleet can be towed by a 1,000-horsepower tugboat, carrying barge fleets of 5,000 to 6,000 tons of cargo. The Yangtze River 2020 vessel once created a high-yield record of towing ten barges upstream from Shanghai to Hankou, carrying 6,908 tons of cargo. Because ships have a large carrying capacity and the working efficiency per horsepower of ships is higher than that of trains and automobiles, the cost of ship transportation is relatively low. Especially for transporting bulk materials such as coal, oil, wood, and ore with large tug-barge fleets, the cost is generally lower than land transportation. In terms of capital construction, the use of natural rivers for navigation does not require the occupation of land, nor does it require laying tracks or building roads. When necessary, the excavation of canals and the renovation of waterways can be combined with the construction of farmland irrigation, flood prevention and drainage, hydropower generation, and industrial water use, so as to give full play to the huge benefits of comprehensive utilization of water resources. For example, the Lianjiang canalization project in Guangdong Province, including all the gates, dams, navigation channels, machinery, and other projects of the five stages, only used about 700 tons of steel, about 20,000 tons of cement, and 5,000 cubic meters of wood, with a total investment of only 11.4 million yuan. The effects that can be achieved are: the minimum water depth of the 180-kilometer waterway from Lianxian County to Lianjiangkou reaches two meters, the shoals are eliminated, the flow rate is gentle, and the river surface is wide, allowing ships to increase from the current maximum carrying capacity of 15 tons to 60 to 500 tons, and they can pass smoothly day and night; the annual coal transportation volume can be increased from 100,000 tons in 1958 to 2.5 million to 4.5 million tons. If calculated according to the estimated coal transportation volume of 1.5 million tons in 1962, the transportation cost can be saved by 17.55 million yuan compared with before canalization. Moreover, after canalization, the use of water heads of each gate and dam for power generation can build four new hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of 3,860 kilowatts, which can solve the electricity needs of Yangshan, Lianxian, and ports, ship locks, and rural areas. And the construction of one kilometer of single-track railway requires about 40% more investment than excavating one kilometer of waterway, and consumes about five times more steel. The maintenance cost and repair materials of water transport channels are much less than those of railways. In terms of manufacturing transportation tools, calculated by the steel required for each deadweight ton, trains also consume more than twice as much as ships. The large carrying capacity of ships, the small number of people used, and the saving of labor force are incomparable to other transportation tools. Therefore, under the premise of taking railways as the key and comprehensively utilizing various transportation tools, fully utilizing and developing water transportation, which can use less steel, less investment, and is the most economical in the use of human and material resources, is completely in line with the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

From the history of our country, many famous cities and towns and larger industrial and commercial bases have been built on the water, which is by no means accidental. The nationally renowned large cities such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Nanjing have all developed on the banks of inland rivers, or at the mouths of rivers into the sea. In Hunan Province, 90% of the cities are located on the banks of rivers. Many cities along the Yangtze River and many factories built on both sides of the Huangpu River in Shanghai have also chosen the most convenient and economical water transport conditions. In our country today, which is carrying out socialist construction at a high speed in a planned way, we should consider fully utilizing water transport to save investment, save steel, and save labor.

Precisely because building factories along rivers has the above-mentioned advantages, it has become a new trend in the industrial layout of various countries in the world. In the past ten years, the Soviet Union has built many new industrial enterprises in many cities along the Volga, Dnieper, and other rivers, such as Saratov, Ulyanovsk, Kazan, and Kuibyshev. In capitalist countries, in order to seize the maximum profit, monopoly capitalists also mostly build factories on the banks of rivers. For example, in 1954, 82% of steel mills, 93% of metallurgical plants, and all newly built coking ovens in the United States were built near waterways. In West Germany, there are also special canals leading to larger industrial centers, similar to railway special lines, connecting with relevant cities and factories. Therefore, in order to rapidly develop the socialist economy and make the most complete and economical use of national resources, we must vigorously advocate the full utilization of water transport and advocate building factories along rivers as much as possible in places where conditions permit. This measure is completely in line with the fundamental interests of the national economy.

Of course, compared with land transportation, water transportation also has certain shortcomings and limitations, such as its poor continuity, slower transportation speed, and the fact that water transportation costs on many rivers are still higher than those of railways. Therefore, some comrades do not pay attention to or are not accustomed to using water transport. As a result, under the circumstances that railway and highway transportation are under great pressure, they have not tried every means to give full play to the role of water transport, which is obviously wrong. We should see that these shortcomings are not insurmountable at present. For example, we can take measures to connect river networks and reduce transshipment to improve the continuity of water transport; we can use methods such as improving the technical performance of ships and improving loading and unloading operations to speed up transportation; especially through vigorously carrying out the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution and continuously improving the level of operation and management, the above-mentioned shortcomings will inevitably be gradually overcome. Moreover, these shortcomings have been or are being overcome in the past few years, which is a fact that is obvious to all. Besides, for certain bulk materials that are not too time-sensitive, slower transportation speed is not a big problem. Therefore, advocating the full utilization of water transport, advocating building factories and mines as close to the water as possible in the country's industrial layout, especially fully utilizing natural rivers and closely combining with water conservancy construction to give full play to the role of water transport, is really a great thing with many advantages and the most economical.

III.

Building factories along rivers can not only fully utilize the large and cheap water transport capacity, but also achieve the effect of comprehensive utilization. It can enable factories to obtain cheap hydropower nearby, save the construction cost of transmission lines, solve the problem of water use and drainage for industries and cities, facilitate the beautification of the factory environment and improve the living conditions of workers, and this industrial layout is also needed for national defense.

Building factories along rivers can obtain cheap power supplied by water conservancy hubs nearby, and save the construction cost of transmission lines. For example: the cost per kilowatt-hour of hydropower is 20% to 30% lower than the cost per kilowatt-hour of thermal power. The transmission loss of thermal power generally accounts for about 5% to 8% of the installed capacity. Therefore, fully developing and utilizing hydropower is one of the important policies for the rapid development of the power industry in our country. At the same time, building factories near water conservancy hubs can greatly shorten transmission lines, and the investment for each kilometer of transmission line reaches tens of thousands of yuan. If all parts of the country can pay full attention to building factories along rivers in industrial construction and try to utilize hydropower as much as possible, then the numbers of reducing production costs and saving transmission line investment will be considerable.

Building factories along rivers can solve the problem of water use for industries and cities. With the vigorous development of construction undertakings and the rapid increase of urban population, water use for modern industries and cities has become a prominent problem that urgently needs to be solved. Especially in large cities like Beijing, there was basically no industry before liberation, and the population was only about two million. After ten years of construction since liberation, many heavy and light industrial factories have been established. It is not only the political and cultural center of the country, but also an important industrial base, changing the face of a purely consumer city. The urban population has increased greatly, and the construction area has more than doubled. At present, both industrial water use and people's living water use feel strained. For example, Xuzhou City in northern Jiangsu is the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai railways, and is an important hub for north-south and east-west transportation in our country. In economic terms, it is a coal-producing industrial base. However, because it is not close to rivers, both industrial water use and people's living water use are quite strained. In modern large cities, the average water consumption per person per day is generally more than half a ton (i.e. 0.5 cubic meters). If calculated according to the average annual water consumption of 100 tons per person, a city with a population of one million has an annual water consumption of about 100 million tons. A steel enterprise with an annual steel output of 5 million tons consumes about 7 to 10 cubic meters per second, and consumes about 200 to 300 million tons of water throughout the year. Obviously, if factories, mines, and cities are built on the water, their water use problems will be relatively easy to solve. If they are not close to the water, many additional burdens will be added in this regard. The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which is being actively built, is not only of great significance to agricultural production and transportation, but will also fundamentally solve the industrial water use and people's living water use problems in many water-deficient cities such as Beijing and Xuzhou. The Songliao Canal, which is being planned, can connect the three northeastern provinces, so that important industrial bases such as Shenyang and Anshan Iron and Steel Company can not only open up water transportation lines, but also facilitate the full satisfaction of industrial and urban water use problems.

Building factories along rivers can improve the living conditions of workers and beautify the factory environment. For example, many scenic cities and recuperation areas are all located near mountains and waters, near the sea, rivers, or lakes. Building factories near the water is not only convenient for transportation and water use and drainage, but also easy to green and shade, and the climate is relatively harmonious. This beautiful scenery and fresh air natural environment also provides more favorable conditions for people's spiritual life and rest and recreation after work. With the leap-forward development of socialist construction, the people's living standards will gradually improve, especially after entering communist society in the future, people's requirements for improving cultural and spiritual life will increase day by day. If a large-scale industrial and mining enterprise or city can be built near rivers and lakes, so that the surrounding environment is flowing with water and the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, and the factory is like a garden, it is very beneficial to improve the living conditions of workers.

The industrial layout of building factories along rivers is also needed for national defense. From the perspective of wartime transportation and preventing damage, building factories along rivers can not only increase a water transportation line that can undertake a large number of transportation tasks, but also this transportation line is generally more difficult to destroy than land transportation lines. The experience of the two world wars has fully proved that river transportation can become an important force for wartime transportation.

IV.

Of course, advocating building factories along rivers does not mean that all factories and enterprises should be built by the river. This is only in places where conditions permit, especially when carrying out new factory and mine construction based on the distribution of the country's mineral resources, we should fully pay attention to combining transportation conditions and try to build factories along rivers to achieve the goal of fully utilizing the country's water resources and giving full play to the role of water transport. Advocating the full utilization of water transport also does not exclude other modes of transportation or belittle the role of other modes of transportation. In particular, it never belittles the backbone role of railway transportation. On the contrary, it is precisely to reduce the excessive burden on railway and highway transportation, so that various transportation tools can be developed more rapidly and fully utilized.

In short, building factories along rivers and fully utilizing water transport is an important issue in the current industrial layout of our country, and it must be put on the agenda and properly resolved. In existing factories, mines, and enterprises, areas and units that have the conditions to utilize water transport but have not yet fully utilized it should quickly change the status quo and develop and utilize water transport as soon as possible. If digging a short section of canal can connect certain factories, mines, and cities with larger rivers and add a new mode of transportation, it seems that this project with little investment, little consumption, and significant economic benefits is also necessary and reasonable.

The rational layout of industrial productive forces is a long-term plan related to whether the entire national economy can develop at a high speed, and should be given high priority by leaders at all levels and all relevant departments. However, this kind of global issue is often not easily seen clearly and deeply understood by people, and must be carefully thought about. As Chairman Mao said in the article "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "Global things cannot be seen with the eyes, but can only be understood by thinking about them with the mind. If you don't think about them with your mind, you won't understand them." (Note 4) The relationship between industrial layout and transportation is precisely such a problem that must arouse our serious consideration and deep thinking.

At present, under the brilliant light of the general line, the cause of national river network construction has entered a new stage of development in conjunction with the mass movement of vigorously developing water conservancy and short-distance transportation. In the not-too-distant future, a new situation will gradually form in which the national water systems are interconnected, large and small rivers are interwoven, trunk lines and branch lines are as dense as spider webs, and the water transport system extends in all directions. I believe that all relevant departments will definitely be able to fully consider transportation conditions when arranging industrial layout and factory and mine construction, comprehensively utilize various transportation tools, especially fully utilize China's rich water resources, and fully utilize water transport, so as to promote the comprehensive, continuous, and high-speed development of the national economy.

    沿河建厂　充分利用水运
    交通部副部长　孙大光
    一
    在我国社会主义建设的新阶段，随着国民经济全面持续的飞跃发展，新的城市和工业基地大量增加，各种大、中、小型的厂、矿、企业像雨后春笋，商品流转额和物资交流量迅速增长，作为国民经济先行部门的交通运输业，必须相应地高速度发展，才能保证和促进生产建设的顺利进行。
    两年来，我国交通运输业有了更快的发展，各种运输方式货运量的增长，都高于工农业生产的平均增长速度，基本上保证了生产建设大跃进对交通运输的要求。但是，目前许多地区仍不断出现客货积压的现象，各种运输方式都还不能充分满足客观需要，交通运输业仍旧是当前国民经济中的薄弱环节。
    为了加速交通事业的发展，国家在今年的基本建设安排中，已扩大了对交通运输的投资比重，以便使交通运输同生产和建设继续跃进的需要相适应。同时，全国交通运输部门的广大职工，也正在广泛深入地开展着技术革新、技术革命和“一条龙”运输大协作的群众运动。这对迅速提高运输能力，更大限度地满足国民经济对交通运输的要求，已经发生并将继续发生巨大的作用。但是，要想彻底改变交通运输的落后状态，必须从多方面加强对交通运输的建设。要以铁路为纲，逐步建成水陆空相互结合的、以现代化运输工具为主的、四通八达的运输网。特别是要从工业布局上，对交通建设通盘加以安排。
    从有些地区的运输情况来看，由于有些厂矿过去在建设规划中对厂内外运输条件的全面安排不够，已经给企业生产的发展带来了一些困难。相反地，有些厂矿由于在建设规划中充分注意了运输问题，能够综合利用各种运输工具，并切实加强了对运输工作的领导，因此，运输工作便大大地促进了生产建设的跃进。这就向我们提出了一个极其重要的问题，即“在厂矿建设中必须充分注意运输条件；在考虑工业布局时必须同时考虑交通运输的布局”。这也是苏联及其他社会主义兄弟国家经济建设的重要经验之一。特别在目前我国国民经济全面持续大跃进的新形势下，各项事业的发展，既要高速度，又要按比例，这就给计划工作和有关的经济管理部门提出了更为迫切的任务：必须从国民经济的整体利益和长远利益着眼，以对全国自然资源与生产力作最充分最经济的使用为出发点，来合理安排工业基本建设的地区分布。应使工业布局接近原料、燃料产地和消费地区，并适合于巩固国防的条件；应依据各个地区的自然、经济条件，考虑到交通运输的发展，进行合理分工，密切协作，以逐步建成全国范围内独立完整的经济体系。
    马克思早就说过：“运输工业……它表现为生产过程在流通过程内的继续。”（注一）列宁也曾指出运输业是联系工农业生产的物质支柱。他在“全俄运输工人代表大会上的演说”中讲道：“联系工农业的物质支柱是什么呢？这就是铁道运输和水路运输。”（注二）马克思、列宁这些英明的论断，充分说明了运输业在国民经济中的重要地位和作用。我们的实际经验和体会，也完全证明了运输与生产的关系是非常密切的：凡是有生产和消费的地方都离不开运输，运输业是联系生产和消费的纽带；生产建设如果离开了运输是寸步难行的；生产带动运输，运输促进生产，两者是辩证的关系。我们在生产运输工作中，强调树立全国一盘棋的思想，大力推广产、运、销“一条龙”大协作的经验，在新的厂矿建设中更应该充分注意生产与运输的密切结合和合理安排。正确地解决工业建设布局与交通运输建设布局的结合问题，是社会主义经济建设中非常重要的方针性、战略性问题之一。
    二
    毛主席在“中国革命与中国共产党”一书中写道：“我们中国是世界上最大国家之一，……有很多的江河湖泽，给我们以舟楫和灌溉之利；有很长的海岸线，给我们以交通海外各民族的方便。”（注三）历史悠久的我国民族，也正是在黄河、长江等水系流域和沿海地区逐渐发展和繁荣起来的。我国的水利资源异常丰富，水运条件非常优越：全国有总长达四十二万公里的天然河流五千多条，有大小湖泊九百多个，有黑龙江、黄河、珠江等水系，特别是世界四大河流之一的长江横贯我国中部，长达五千八百公里，干支流通航里程六万余公里，下游水深流缓，可通行五千吨级的海轮。此外，尚有长达一千五百多公里的京杭大运河，流经冀、鲁、江、浙四省，连接海河、黄河、淮河、长江、钱塘江等水系，历史悠久，著名于世。我国地处温带，绝大部分河湖终年不冻，四季通航。大陆海岸线长约一万二千公里，有许多优良海港和河港，是发展水上运输和水陆联运的重要枢纽。有无数峡谷，可以建成巨大的水库和发电站。而大的河流两侧，一般的不是盛产粮棉的平原，就是矿藏丰富的山区，因而也是国家工农业生产建设的重要地带。
    建设厂矿是为了对国家的天然资源进行开发和加工，而充分开发利用水利资源，则与对煤、铁、石油、有色金属、森林等资源的开发利用具有同样的意义。因此，在工业布局和厂矿建设中，充分注意到开发水利、利用水运、使工业靠近动力来源和交通动脉是完全符合国民经济的总体利益的。
    解放十年来，我国人民已在党的正确领导下取得了水利建设的辉煌成就。平原地区的河网化迅速发展，整治开发河道运输的工程，正结合农田水利的建设和短途运输的群众运动积极进行，像三门峡、新安江这样规模巨大的水利枢纽正在施工兴建。今后，在这样优越的自然条件和大搞水利建设的有利形势下，更应考虑尽量沿河建设工厂，以充分利用国家的水利资源和发挥水上运输的优越条件。
    沿河建厂可以充分利用量大价廉的水运运力。因为一个较大的厂矿或工业基地，其每年运输量高达数百乃至数千万吨，这样巨大的运输任务，仅靠一种运输方式是不能充分满足需要的。实际上任何一种运输工具都有一定的局限性，往往这种运输工具受到季节性限制的时候，正是另一种运输工具发挥长处的时候。如果只有一种运输方式，便容易在运输任务激增或客观条件发生某些变化的时候，形成线路堵塞或港站通过能力不相适应的饱和状态，甚至造成生产运输互相脱节的现象。如果有条件利用水运，增加一种运输方式，则可大大减轻陆上运输的压力，并可在综合利用各种运输方式当中，充分发挥水上运输的优越性。
    在一条河流上，可以同时行驶数量众多的船舶，一个中型船队，可由一条一千马力的拖轮，拖带载货五、六千吨的驳船队，长江2020轮曾由上海至汉口创造了上水拖带十条驳船，载货六千九百零八吨的高产纪录。由于船舶载运量大，以及船舶的每马力工作效率比火车、汽车为高，因而轮船运输的成本费用也比较低。特别是用大型的拖驳船队装运煤炭、石油、木材、矿石等大宗物资，费用一般都比陆运低廉。在基本建设方面，利用天然河流通航不需占用土地，不需铺轨筑路，必要时开挖运河、整治航道，也都可与农田灌溉、防洪排涝、水力发电、工业用水等事业的建设结合起来，能够发挥综合利用水利资源的巨大效益。例如广东省的连江渠化，包括五个梯级的全部闸、坝及航道、机械等工程，仅用钢铁七百吨左右，水泥二万吨左右，木材五千立方米，总投资额仅一千一百四十万元。可以收到的效果是：从连县到连江口的一百八十公里航道，最小水深达到二米，滩险消除，流速平缓，河面宽阔，通航船舶可由现在的最高载重量十五吨，提高到六十到五百吨，并日夜畅通；年运煤量可由1958年的十万吨，增加到二百五十到四百五十万吨。如按1962年预计煤运量一百五十万吨计算，运输费用可比渠化前节省一千七百五十五万元。并且渠化后利用各闸坝的水头发电，可新建四个水电站，装机容量共达三千八百六十瓩，能解决阳山、连县及港湾、船闸与农村的用电问题。而建设一公里单线铁路，比开挖一公里航道约需多投资40％，多耗用钢材五倍左右，水运航道的维护费用及保修用料更比铁路少得多。在制造运输工具方面，按每一个载重吨所需的钢材计算，火车也比轮船多消耗一倍以上。而船舶载重量大、用人少、节省劳动力，更非其他运输工具可比。因此，在以铁路为纲、各种运输工具相互结合综合利用的前提下，充分利用和发展能够少用钢铁、少用投资，在人力物力使用上最为经济的水上运输，是完全符合多快好省的原则的。
    从我国历史上看，许多名城重镇和较大的工业商业基地都建设在水边，这决不是偶然的。全国闻名的天津、上海、广州、武汉、重庆、南京等大城市都发展在内河边上，或者有河流出海的海口，湖南省则有90％的城市是位于江河两岸的。长江沿岸的许多城市和上海黄浦江两岸建设的许多工厂，也都是选择了最为方便经济的水上运输条件。在我国正在有计划地高速度地进行社会主义建设的今天，我们更应该考虑充分利用水运，以节约投资，节约钢材，节约劳动力。
    正因为沿河建厂有上述各种好处，所以它已经成为世界各国工业布局上的一种新的趋势。苏联近十年来在沿伏尔加、第聂伯等河流上的许多城市中，兴建了许多新的工业企业，如萨拉托夫、乌里扬诺夫斯克、喀山、古比雪夫等。在资本主义国家，垄断资本家为了攫取最大限度的利润，也多是把工厂建在河边上。如1954年美国82％的炼钢厂、93％的冶金厂和全部新建的炼焦炉，都建设在水道附近。在西德还有专门的运河通往较大的工业中心，类似铁路的专用线，与有关城市和工厂联系起来。因此，为了迅速发展社会主义经济和最充分最经济地利用国家资源，我们必须大力提倡充分利用水运，提倡在有条件的地方尽量沿河建厂。这一措施是完全符合国民经济的根本利益的。
    当然水上运输与陆运比较也还存在一定缺点和局限性，例如它的连续性较差，运输速度较慢，以及目前许多河流上的水运成本还较铁路为高等等，所以有些同志还不重视或者不习惯利用水运。以致在铁路、公路运输压力都很大的情况下，而没有千方百计地发挥水运作用，这显然是不对的。我们应该看到，现时这些缺点并不是不能克服的。例如，可以采取沟通河网、减少中转倒载的办法以提高水运的连续性；可以用改善船舶技术性能和改进装卸作业等办法以加快运输速度；特别是通过大搞技术革新、技术革命的群众运动和不断提高经营管理水平，上述缺点必然会逐步地得到克服。而且几年来这些缺点已经或者正在克服，这是有目共睹的事实。何况对于某些时间性不太迫切的大宗物资来说，运输速度稍慢也并不是太大的问题。因此，提倡充分利用水运，提倡在国家工业布局中建设厂矿尽量靠近水边，特别是充分利用自然河流，密切结合水利建设，以充分发挥水上运输的作用，这实在是一件好处特多、最为经济的大好事。

    沿河建设工厂不仅可以充分利用量大价廉的水上运力，而且可以收综合利用之功。它可以使工厂就近取得廉价的水力电源，节约输电线路的建设费用，可以解决工业及城市的用水和排水问题，有利于美化工厂环境和改善职工的生活条件，并且这种工业布局也为国防上所需要。
    沿河建厂可以就近取得水利枢纽供给的廉价电源，并节约输电线路的建设费用。例如：每千度水电的成本比每千度火电的成本低20％至30％以上，火电的输电损失，一般约占装机容量的5％至8％。因此充分开发和利用水力发电，这是我国迅速发展电力事业的重要方针之一。同时，在水利枢纽附近建厂，其输电线路可大大缩短，而每一公里输电线路的投资即达十几万元。如果全国各地在工业建设中，都能充分注意沿河建厂，尽量利用水力发电，那么，降低生产成本和节约输电线路投资的数字，将是相当可观的。
    沿河建厂可以解决工业及城市的用水问题。随着建设事业的蓬勃发展和城市人口的迅速增加，现代工业及城市的用水，已经成为一个迫切需要解决的突出问题。特别像北京这样的大城市，解放前根本没有什么工业，人口只有二百万左右；解放后经过十年来的建设，现已建立了许多重工业和轻工业的工厂。既是全国的政治、文化中心，又是一个重要的工业基地，改变了单纯消费城市的面貌。城市人口大大增加，建筑面积扩大一倍以上，目前工业用水和人民生活用水都感到紧张。又如江苏北部的徐州市，是津浦、陇海两条铁路的交叉点，是我国南北交通和东西交通的重要枢纽，在经济上是个产煤工业基地。但是由于不靠近河流，因而工业用水和人民生活用水也都相当紧张。在现代化的大城市中，按人口计算一般每人每天需水半吨以上（即零点五立方米），如按每人每年平均用水一百吨计算，一百万人口的城市，年用水量达一亿吨左右。一个年炼钢五百万吨的钢铁企业，其用水量约为每秒钟平均七至十个立方米，全年耗水约二至三亿吨。很显然，如果在水边建设厂矿和城市，其用水问题就比较容易解决；如果不靠近水边，在这方面就会增加许多额外的负担。目前正在积极兴修的京杭大运河，不仅对农业生产和交通运输具有重要意义，而且将使北京、徐州等许多缺水城市的工业用水和人民生活用水问题获得根本解决。正在规划中的松辽运河，则可把东北三省连接起来，使沈阳、鞍钢等重要工业基地，既增辟了水上运输线路，也便于充分满足工业及城市的用水问题。
    沿河建厂可以改善职工的生活条件和美化工厂环境。例如许多风景优美的城市和疗养区，都是有山有水靠近海边河边或湖边的。靠近水边建厂，不仅交通运输便利，用水排水方便，而且容易绿化成荫，气候比较调和。这种风景优美、空气清新的自然环境，对于人们的精神生活和劳动后的休息娱乐，也提供了更为有利的条件。随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，人民生活水平将逐步提高，特别是将来进入共产主义社会以后，人们对提高文化生活和精神生活的要求将与日俱增。一个大型的工矿企业或城市，如果能依江傍水，使周围环境流水潺潺、鸟语花香，工厂如花园，这对改善职工的生活条件是非常有利的。
    沿河建厂的工业布局，也为国防上所需要。从战时运输和防止破坏的观点来看，不仅沿河建厂可以增加一条能够担负大量运输任务的水上运输线，而且这种运输线一般说是较陆上运输线更难破坏的。两次世界大战的经验，已经充分证明了河运可以成为战时运输的重要力量。
    四
    当然，提倡沿河建厂并不是主张一切工厂企业都应建设在河旁水边，这只是在有条件的地方，特别在根据国家矿产资源的分布进行新的厂矿建设时，应该充分注意到结合运输条件，尽量沿河建厂，以达到充分利用国家水利资源和充分发挥水运作用的目的。提倡充分利用水运也绝不是排斥其他各种运输方式，贬低其他各种运输方式的作用。特别是绝不贬低铁路运输的骨干作用。相反地，正是为了减轻铁路、公路运输的过重负担，而使各种运输工具都能得到更迅速的发展和充分利用。
    总之，沿河建设工厂，充分利用水运，这是当前我国工业布局中的一个重要问题，必须把它提到议事日程上来妥善地加以解决。在现有厂矿企业中，凡是有条件利用水运而至今尚未充分利用的地区和单位，应该迅速改变现状，尽快地把水运事业发展和利用起来。如果开挖一段不长的运河就可使某些厂、矿、城市与较大河流沟通起来，增加一种新的运输方式，看来这种投资不多、消耗不大而经济效益显著的工程，也是必要的和合理的。
    工业生产力的合理布局，这是关系到整个国民经济能否高速度发展的百年大计，应该引起各级领导和各有关部门的高度重视。但是，这种全局性的问题，往往不容易被人们迅速看清和深刻体会，必须认真地想一想。正如毛主席在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一文中所说的：“全局性的东西，眼睛看不见，只能用心思去想一想才能懂得，不用心思去想，就不会懂得。”（注四）工业布局与交通运输的关系，正是这样一个必须引起我们认真考虑和深思的问题。
    目前，在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国河网化的事业已经结合大兴水利和短途运输的群众运动进入了新的发展阶段。在不太长的时期内，全国各条水系互相沟通，大小河流脉络交错，干线支线密如蛛网，水运体系四通八达的新局面就可逐渐形成。相信各有关部门在安排工业布局和厂矿建设时，也一定能够充分考虑到交通运输条件，综合利用各种运输工具，特别是充分利用我国丰富的水利资源，充分利用水运，以促进国民经济全面、持续、高速度的发展。
