Small factories accomplish big things

The mass movement of "small-scale, indigenous groups" (小土群) for the chemical industry in Taiyuan City has achieved brilliant results. In the past two years, more than 120 chemical industry "small-scale, indigenous groups" have been established by schools, streets, and people's communes throughout the city, producing more than 1,000 kinds of products. In January and February alone, the chemical products produced by the "small-scale, indigenous groups" amounted to more than 4,250 tons, equivalent to 82.68% of the chemical products produced by units under the city's Chemical Industry Bureau in January and February. Many of these products have reached the standards of foreign products.
