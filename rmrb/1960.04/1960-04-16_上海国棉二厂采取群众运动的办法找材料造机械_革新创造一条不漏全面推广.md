(Reported by this newspaper from Shanghai on the 15th) The Party Committee of Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Mill, implementing the spirit of continuous revolution, after achieving many technological innovation projects, continues to vigorously promote mass movements, focusing on promotion, consolidation, improvement, and enhancement, ensuring that every innovation project that has been successful and can be promoted blossoms and bears fruit rapidly. Twenty-eight major manual operation jobs in the factory have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.

The No. 2 State Cotton Mill was one of the eight red banners in Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and an advanced collective that attended the National Conference of Heroes last year. This year, the factory launched a mass-based technological revolution movement. By the end of February, the factory had manufactured 485 indigenous and foreign machines and over a thousand tools. However, at that time, the Party Committee discovered a new situation: many machines and tools that had been successfully trial-produced were being shelved aside and not used extensively in production, some being used one day and then stopped for three days. The Party Committee inspected the promotion and application of technological innovation projects and found that some cadres did not actively improve on the shortcomings discovered in the use of certain machines and tools but waited until they were completely flawless before promoting them. Some cadres also harbored the idea that "innovation is easy, but promotion is difficult." They had "two fears" about mobilizing the masses to promote innovative achievements: first, they feared that the widespread promotion of new machines and tools would lead the masses to ask the leadership for materials; second, they feared it would affect current production.

The Party Committee believed that these ideological problems were essentially a matter of not thoroughly trusting the masses and new things. Therefore, it organized cadres to make a summary of the previous stage of the movement and conduct theoretical discussions. The Party Committee also pointed out to the cadres that an innovation cannot be perfect at the beginning; it can only be gradually consolidated and improved through continuous improvement in use. If the successfully innovated machines and tools are shelved aside and not used or promoted, it would dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. Problems such as the supply of raw materials in the promotion should be fully mobilized by the masses to solve by everyone's efforts. The cadres also studied the article "How Should Marxists View New Things" published in the People's Daily. Based on the improved understanding, the cadres vigorously mobilized the masses to appraise innovation and creation, formulate promotion plans, and actively promote them. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to carry out large-scale inventory clearance activities to solve the problem of raw material supply. The Party Committee also made two resolutions: First, all projects that have been successfully tested, even if they have many shortcomings, must be insisted on being used; continuously improved during use, and designated personnel responsible for absorbing mass opinions, so that each innovation is gradually improved. Second, establish inspection teams combining leading cadres at all levels and the masses to check the promotion and use, and strengthen the leadership of the movement.

In early March, a mass upsurge of consolidating, promoting innovation and creation, and seizing a large area of ​​bumper harvests appeared in the whole factory. The masses of employees said at the group meetings: "To engage in technological revolution, we must revolutionize thoroughly. If we succeed but do not promote it, and give up halfway, what kind of technological revolution is that!" The employees organized "three-in-one" appraisal groups and adopted the method of going to the site to watch, ask, discuss, and appraise at the same time to carry out mass appraisal of each innovation and creation. Each "three-in-one" group implemented "five fixes" (determine the promotion project, assign people, set the time, set the inspection, set the measures), so that the promotion work was implemented item by item and every item was taken care of. After the masses were mobilized, the speed of innovation and creation promotion was very fast, greatly breaking through the original plan of the leaders. For example, the automation of twisting and wiping boards was originally scheduled to promote one and a half units from mid-February to the end of March; however, the masses promoted ten units in three or four days. Replacing manual yarn tube removal with semi-automatic doffing machines requires modification of the spindle parts on the spinning frame. This reform has a large workload, and some people think it is difficult to promote it on a large scale for a while; however, all the maintenance, maintenance, car-stopping, doffing workers and department cadres in the factory were mobilized, and more than 3,000 people fought for three days and three nights, and all 100,000 spindles were modified and the advanced technology of semi-automatic doffing was fully promoted. In the process of promotion, the masses also improved many innovations and creations, making them more perfect. For example, the semi-automatic doffing machine used in the foreign yarn workshop was heavy, bulky and slow, and the car-stopping workers were unwilling to use it; later, it was used and modified more than 20 times, and as a result, it was light and fast to use, and the car-stopping workers welcomed it very much.

In the process of promoting innovation and creation, the employees adopted the method of self-reliance. They said: "We use poor methods to make innovations, and we also use poor methods to promote them." The factory's old material warehouse has become a "treasure hunt" for the masses, and old goods stalls and old goods stores have become their material "supply stations." In this way, they cobbled together and found various sizes of steel totaling more than 12 tons, solving 90% of the raw material supply problems.

In order to help workers quickly master the operating skills of using new machines and new tools, the factory held new technology training classes, and in the process of training doffing workers, summarized a set of accurate, stable, and finding (the cause of mechanical failure, etc.) experience in using semi-automatic doffing machines.

    上海国棉二厂采取群众运动的办法找材料造机械
    革新创造一条不漏全面推广
    本报上海15日电　上海国棉二厂党委贯彻不断革命精神，在实现了许多技术革新项目以后，继续大搞群众运动，抓推广、巩固、改进、提高，使已经成功可以推广的革新项目一条不漏，迅速开花结果。全厂二十八种主要手工操作工种已经基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。
    国棉二厂是1958年大跃进中上海市的八面红旗之一，也是出席去年全国群英会的先进集体。今年，这个厂开展了群众性的技术革命运动。到2月底，全厂就制造了四百八十五台土洋机器和上千种工具。但是，当时党委发现了一个新情况：有不少已经试制成功的机具被搁置一旁，没有在生产中大量使用，有的用一天、停三天。党委检查了技术革新项目推广应用的情况，发现一部分干部对某些机器和工具在使用过程中发现的缺点，不去积极改进，而是等待它完整无缺以后再推广。有的干部还存着一种“革新容易推广难”的思想。他们对发动群众推广革新成果，存在着“二怕”：一怕普遍推广新机具，群众向领导要材料；二怕影响当前生产。
    党委认为：这些思想问题，实质上是对群众和新生事物相信得不彻底的问题。于是组织干部对前一阶段的运动进行小结，进行务虚。党委还向干部们指出：一项革新开始不可能十全十美，只有在使用中不断地改进，才能逐步巩固和提高，如果把革新成功的机具搁置一旁不去使用，不加推广，就会挫伤群众的积极性；推广中的原材料供应等问题，应该充分发动群众，人人动手加以解决。干部们还学习了人民日报发表的“马克思主义者应当如何看待新生事物”的文章。在认识提高的基础上，干部们大力发动群众鉴定革新创造，订出推广规划，积极推广。同时，发动群众大搞清仓活动，解决原材料供应问题。党委并作出两条决议：一、凡是已经试验成功的项目，那怕缺点很多，也要坚持试用；在使用过程中不断改进，并确定专人负责，吸收群众意见，使每一革新逐步完善。二、成立各级领导干部与群众结合的检查组，检查推广使用情况，加强对运动的领导。
    3月初，一个群众性的巩固、推广革新创造，夺取大面积丰收的高潮，在全厂出现了。职工群众纷纷在小组会上表示：“搞技术革命就要革彻底，成功了不推广，半途而废，还算甚么技术革命！”职工们组织了“三结合”鉴定小组，对每个革新创造采取到现场边看、边问、边讨论、边鉴定的办法，进行群众性的鉴定。各个“三结合”小组都实行“五定”（定出推广项目，定人，定时间，定检查，定措施），使推广工作项项落实，条条有着落，群众动起来以后，革新创造推广的速度很快，大大冲破了领导人员原来的计划。例如捻线打擦板自动化，原来规定从2月中旬到3月底推广一台半；可是群众在三、四天内就推广了十台。用半自动落纱机代替手工拔纱管，需要改动细纱机上的锭子零件，这项改革工作量很大，有人认为一时难以大面积推广；但是，全厂保全、保养、挡车、落纱工人和科室干部一齐动员，三千多人奋战了三天三夜，十万锭子全部改好，全面推广了半自动落纱的先进技术。在推广过程中，群众还改进了许多革新创造，使它们更加完善。如洋线间开始用的半自动落纱机，双刀又笨又重又慢，挡车工不愿意用；后来，一面使用，一面修改了二十多次，结果用起来又轻又快，挡车工人都很欢迎。
    在推广革新创造的过程中，职工们采取了自力更生的办法。他们说：“我们用穷办法闹革新，也要用穷办法推广。”厂里的旧料仓库变成群众的“寻宝库”，旧货摊、旧货商店变成了他们的材料“供应站”。就这样，他们东拼西凑找到各种大小钢材达十二吨之多，解决了90％的原材料供应问题。
    为了帮助工人迅速掌握使用新机器新工具的操作技术，厂里举办了新技术训练班，并在训练落纱工过程中，总结出了一套准、稳、找（机械故障发生的原因等）的使用半自动落纱机的经验。（附图片）
