Technological Innovation Speeds Up Output
Gansu and Guangdong Design Institutes Complete Annual Tasks

    Since the beginning of this year, the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau Design Institute has launched a new upsurge of comprehensive technological innovation. Currently, all trades have basically realized an electrified one-stop system for calculation, and drafting has been mechanized. The entire institute has already overfulfilled its annual design tasks ahead of schedule.
    Since early February, the Guangdong Provincial Architectural Design Institute has launched a vigorous "six transformations" (tool advancement, calculation tabulation, drafting assembly, design generalization, data manualization, operation regularization) innovation campaign, greatly improving design efficiency. The entire institute has already overfulfilled its annual workload.

    革新技术出速度
    甘肃广东两设计院完成全年任务
    甘肃省建筑工程局设计院今年以来，掀起了全面革新技术的新高潮。现在，各工种已经基本实现计算电气化一条龙，制图实现了机械化。全院已经提前超额完成了全年设计任务。
    广东省建筑设计院2月上旬以来，开展了轰轰烈烈的“六化”（工具先进化、计算图表化、制图装配化、设计通用化、资料手册化、操作规律化）革新配套运动，设计效率大大提高。全院已超额完成了今年全年的工作量。
