Comrades, Representatives:
    I fully agree with and support all the reports of the Congress and guarantee to resolutely implement them.
    Now, I would like to report to the Congress on the development of transportation in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province.
    Before liberation, transportation in the mountainous areas of western Hunan was extremely backward. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, a total of only 177 kilometers of highways were built, averaging only 6.4 kilometers per year, and only three county towns out of ten could be reached by car. Now, the total mileage of highways open to traffic in the entire prefecture has reached 1,188 kilometers, an average increase of 118 kilometers per year, a 5.7-fold increase compared to the early days of liberation. In the two years from 1958 to 1959 alone, 620 kilometers were built, equivalent to 2.5 times the length built by the Kuomintang reactionaries in more than 30 years. Not only are all counties accessible by car, but more than half of the communes are also accessible by car. The total river mileage of the prefecture is 3,177 kilometers, of which only 616 kilometers were navigable before liberation. Now, the navigable mileage has reached 1,361 kilometers, an increase of 1.2 times compared to before liberation. Nearly half of the communes are accessible by wooden sailing boats, and many dangerous shoals are now dotted with white sails. Many dry small rivers are also traversed by boats. In 1959, the total volume of highway and waterway transportation in the prefecture reached 487,800 tons, an increase of more than one-fold compared to 1958, equivalent to 19 times that before liberation. In the past, short-distance transportation in the vast rural areas relied on carrying goods by shoulder, but now it is vehicular transportation on land, shipping on rivers, pack animal transportation in high mountains, and cableways. Civilian transport vehicles completed a transportation volume of 1,340,600 tons, an increase of more than three-fold compared to the 313,000 tons in 1958. There is basically no backlog of materials. This has powerfully promoted the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and is conducive to the development of the national economy. For example, in 1959, the purchase of local and special products in our prefecture reached 35 million yuan, and the purchase of various wild fiber raw materials and others reached 2 million dan. With so much income for the peasants, they need to buy a lot of means of production and industrial products, and these exchanges are all borne by transportation.
　　The development of postal and telecommunications services is even more significant. At the time of liberation, there were only about 20 post and telecommunications bureaus and offices in the prefecture, and they were often sabotaged by bandits, existing only in name. Now, the long-distance lines are 4,072 kilometers, an increase of 91 times compared to before liberation, and the intra-county telephone lines are 14,954 kilometers, an increase of 34 times compared to before liberation. The total length of postal routes has reached 19,398 kilometers. The entire prefecture is now accessible by post and telecommunications to every commune and team. Telephone conferences can be held to the commune and brigade levels, and each commune can see the county newspaper on the same day, making the development of postal and telecommunications services play the role of a communications soldier in the Great Leap Forward. In short, thanks to the rapid development of transportation in the past two years, the backward situation in our prefecture's history, where "high mountain paths reach the clouds, and thousand-year-old carrying poles break the back," has been fundamentally changed. A transportation and postal and telecommunications network combining land and water is taking shape. As the masses sing, "A land and water transport network, the sound of vehicles is everywhere, boats shuttle in the rivers, cattle carry goods all over the mountains, the suffering of thousands of years has been overcome, and the Party's kindness cannot be expressed enough."
The great leap forward in transportation first proves the importance of adhering to the leadership of the Party and upholding the principle of putting politics in command. The Party is the core of our revolutionary cause. With the leadership of the Party, the revolutionary cause will be victorious, and construction will move forward. Political thought is the soul of all work. With politics in command, the enthusiasm of the masses will soar. If we want to accelerate the development of transportation, we must resolve the right-leaning conservatism and fear of difficulties that exist in the minds of some cadres and the masses on the transportation front. They believe that "building roads and making vehicles in mountainous areas is a waste of manpower and money, and it is not worth the effort," "Honggan River is shallow, with rapid shoals and many stones, and the task is difficult to complete," "Carrying out short-distance transportation on a large scale strains labor and affects agricultural production," and so on. In response to these right-leaning conservative ideas, we seized the key link of ideology, summarized the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, spoke extensively about the new situation in socialist construction, launched a great airing of views, great debates, clarified erroneous ideas, established lofty ambitions, and boosted revolutionary enthusiasm, setting off a new situation of "building a road network and busy land and water transportation" throughout the prefecture. For example, the Baoding Maogou Commune Party Committee, through mobilizing the masses for debate, unified ideological understanding and unanimously believed that to develop Wanbao Mountain, it is necessary to develop transportation, build roads, and build vehicles and ships on a large scale. Under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, 12,000 people were organized, working hard for ten days, and built four simple highways with a total length of 42 kilometers. Eight of the ten brigades in the commune are accessible by car. At the beginning of the large-scale development of pack animal and oxcart transportation, some people with serious right-leaning conservative ideas pointed fingers and said sarcastically: "Since ancient times, cattle have plowed the fields, and fish swim on the shore, ginseng and swallow's nest are inherently valuable, but don't dream of getting them without money." Some people even told strange stories and made absurd arguments. Faced with this sharp struggle between new things and right-leaning conservatism, Party committees at all levels adopted the measures of strengthening specific leadership, organizing ideological debates, secretaries personally taking charge, designing oxcarts, training pack animals, setting examples, breaking through difficulties, summarizing experiences, and promoting them comprehensively. In less than half a year, the entire prefecture basically realized oxcart transportation. At the beginning, one person drove one oxcart, carrying 300 jin and traveling 25 kilometers a day. Now it has been increased to one person driving two to three carts, carrying more than 600 jin and traveling 45 to 60 kilometers a day, greatly saving transportation labor and playing a significant role in connecting internal and external material exchanges and supporting socialist construction.
    The experience of the Great Leap Forward proves that adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs" and actively implementing the transportation construction policy of "water transport as the main, combining land and water, indigenous methods as the main, combining indigenous and foreign methods" is a realistic way to develop transportation in mountainous areas quickly, well, and economically. Facts have proved that where this policy is conscientiously implemented, work is taken proactively, and industrial and agricultural production is supported in a timely manner. Conversely, where work does not keep up, a heavy price is paid. The development process of transportation in Longshan County in our prefecture is the practical process of using "walking on two legs." In the first half of last year, some material transportation departments believed that highways had been built and concentrated a large amount of materials to the roadside, waiting for cars. As a result, materials were backlogged, mildewed, and deteriorated, and state property was lost, affecting production. The county party committee immediately reversed the idea of favoring foreign methods and relying solely on cars, put forward the idea of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, and developing vehicles and ships simultaneously," mobilized the masses to march towards the large and small rivers, built wooden sailing boats and oxcarts on a large scale, and worked hard for 70 days, so that all rivers in the county were shipped by boat, and all the materials backlogged along the way were transported out, and the problem was solved easily.
    The experience of the Great Leap Forward also proves that carrying out mass movements on a large scale is the fundamental method for rapidly developing transportation, and it is the lifeline for implementing the general line. The people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture have a particularly urgent demand to quickly change the backwardness of transportation. At the same time, only by carrying out mass movements on a large scale can the backwardness of transportation be quickly changed. The more vigorously and solidly the mass movement is carried out, the more colorful and vigorously transportation will develop. In the Great Leap Forward, we launched a mass movement of the whole people running transportation in the entire prefecture. During the short-distance transportation assault movement in October last year, the number of people mobilized in the entire prefecture reached 1.2 million, clearing all backlogged materials. The whole people in Sangzhi County were mobilized to carry out the "three-light" (collect all, transfer all, transport all) competition, mobilizing 4,966 people in three days and completing a transportation volume of 552 tons. The Hululu Commune in Baojing County realized pack animal transportation, training more than 800 cattle in five days. In Yongshun County, the suburban commune, everyone became a craftsman, every household built vehicles, worked hard for three days and nights, and realized vehicular transportation. The first vehicle commune in the county mobilized the masses, used slack farming seasons, and worked hard for three months to realize shipping on the 90-mile-long dry river channel. The masses sang:
    Mengdong River, Mengdong River,
    Many boats on the Mengdong River,
    One boat carries dozens of dan,
    No more shoulder carrying to suffer,
    Happiness all depends on the Communist Party,
    Eighty-year-olds smile happily.
    These vivid facts powerfully illustrate that the power of mass movements is infinite and invincible. As long as we fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, the face of transportation will change rapidly, and miracles will be created.
    Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization is an important key to accelerating transportation construction, and it is also the main way to reduce manpower, increase production, and develop the national economy at high speed. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have launched a labor competition upsurge of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping among the masses, as well as a revolutionary method of learning if you don't know, studying if you don't understand, and debating if you don't understand. This has greatly broken superstitions, conservative ideas, and mysterious viewpoints, established a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and promoted the continuous development and growth of new things, continuous increases in production, and an endless stream of inventions. For example, according to different operating methods, the Luxi Station and Port in our prefecture implemented five major technical innovations, equipped the port and station with a combination of indigenous and foreign mechanization for handling loading and unloading, and linked the loading and unloading processes of cars and sailboats together, creating a new record of an average loading time of 15 seconds for each 8-ton car and an average unloading time of 10 minutes, increasing work efficiency by 10 to 75 times, saving more than 500 laborers per day, and increasing the loading and unloading volume from a maximum of 450 tons per day in the past to 2,000 tons. The improved two-section boat in Baojing County has dangerous shoals upstream. The large ship is folded into two small boats. When going downstream, the large ship is connected again. It is loaded more, runs faster, and is safer. Such innovations by everyone and everywhere, with pacesetters everywhere, are powerfully promoting the leap forward development of transportation and postal and telecommunications services.
    Fully utilizing water power and implementing comprehensive utilization is an important link in developing mountainous areas and building transportation in mountainous areas. Now, we have transformed many small rivers that "have not been navigable for thousands of years and become disasters during floods" into "boats come and go like shuttles, and dry rivers become happy rivers" through vigorous rectification, and we have implemented comprehensive utilization, which is conducive to production and benefits the people. For example, the Guanyingxian Stream in Zhujita Commune in Sangzhi is narrow, with rapid currents and chaotic sand and gravel. After comprehensive management, it can now be navigated by wooden sailboats of more than one ton. Fifteen hydropower stations have been established along the coast, driving 55 large and small machines for processing, saving 100 laborers every day, increasing irrigation for 3,600 mu of farmland, and increasing grain production by an estimated 180,000 jin per year. Therefore, we must fully utilize the potential of water energy to create more material wealth for the country.
    In the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, the development of transportation has been rapid, the achievements have been great, and the experience has been rich. This is the brilliant victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune. This year is the great starting point of the 1960s. Under the wise leadership of the Party and holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture will strengthen communist cooperation on the basis of the victory of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The first plane in the history of the autonomous prefecture will take off; the first light railway in the autonomous prefecture will appear; motorized sailing boats will travel to and from the Yuan, Li, You, and Wu rivers; high-altitude steel cableways will be erected in the high mountains, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas; and mechanized, semi-mechanized, and automated and semi-automated loading and unloading equipment will be realized at various ports and stations, and tens of thousands of various vehicles will be running on the plains and mountainous areas. The people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture must use greater revolutionary enthusiasm and higher construction speed to realize the all-round transportation network composed of water, land, and air throughout the prefecture, promote a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and jointly build a beautiful and happy socialist motherland with the people of all ethnic groups across the country.
    I wish the Congress a complete success!

### 水陆并举　车船齐发  彭祖贵代表谈湘西交通运输的大发展

    水陆并举　车船齐发
    彭祖贵代表谈湘西交通运输的大发展主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护大会的各项报告，并保证坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我想将湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州的交通运输发展情况，向大会作一汇报。
    在解放前，湘西山区的交通是非常落后的。国民党反动派统治时期，一共只修了一百七十七公里公路，平均每年只修六点四公里，十个县只有三个县城能通汽车。现在全州通车公路里程已达一千一百八十八公里，平均每年增加一百一十八公里，比解放初期增长五点七倍，仅在1958年至1959年的两年里，就修了六百二十公里，等于国民党反动派统治三十多年所修公路的二点五倍。不但县县通了汽车，而且有半数以上的公社也通了汽车。全州河流里程三千一百七十七公里，解放时通航的仅有六百一十六公里，现在通航里程已达到一千三百六十一公里，比解放前增长了一点二倍，近半数的公社可通木帆船，许多天险滩道也白帆飘扬，不少枯水小河亦船只穿流。1959年全州公路航道运输量达四十八万七千八百多吨，比1958年增长一倍多，等于解放前的十九倍。过去广大农村的短途运输都是靠肩挑背负，而现在则是陆路车子化、河道船运化、高山驮运化、索道化。民间运输工具完成运输量达一百三十四万零六百吨，比1958年的三十一万三千吨增长三倍多。基本上实现了物资无积压。这就有力地促进了工农业生产的跃进，有利于国民经济的发展。如我州1959年收购土特产品达三千五百万元，收购的各种野生纤维原料等达二百万担。农民收入这么多钱，就要买进很多生产资料和工业品，这些交换都是靠着交通运输来承担的。
　　邮电事业发展更为显著。解放时全州仅有二十几处邮电局、所，且常遭土匪破坏，有名无实。现在长途线路四千零七十二条公里，比解放前增长九十一倍，县内电话线路一万四千九百五十四条公里，比解放前增长三十四倍，邮路总长已达一万九千三百九十八公里，全州已是社社、队队通邮电，电话会议可以开到公社和大队，各公社可以看到当天县报，使邮电事业的发展给大跃进起了通讯兵的作用。总之，由于两年来交通运输事业的飞跃发展，我州历史上的“高山小路插云霄，千年扁担压断腰”的落后面貌已经根本改观。一个以水陆结合的交通运输邮电网正在形成。正如群众所歌唱的“水陆运输网，遍地车声响，河里船如梭，满山牛驮忙，千年疾苦今摆脱，党的恩情说不完。”交通运输事业大跃进，首先证明了坚持党的领导，坚持政治挂帅的重要。党是我们革命事业的核心，有党的领导，革命事业就取得胜利，建设就向前发展。政治思想是一切工作的灵魂。有了政治挂帅，群众干劲就冲天。我们要加速发展交通运输事业，必须解决交通战线上部分干群思想上存在的右倾保守和畏难情绪，他们认为“在高山地区修路造车是劳民伤财，费力不讨好”，“弘干河水浅，滩急石头多，任务难完成”，“大搞短途运输，劳力紧张，影响农业生产”等等。针对这些右倾保守思想，我们抓住思想之纲，总结大跃进的成就，大讲社会主义建设的新形势，开展大鸣、大放、大辩论，澄清错误思想，树立雄心壮志，鼓足革命干劲，在全州范围内掀起了一个“修建道路网，水陆运输忙”的新局面。如保靖毛沟公社党委，通过发动群众辩论，统一思想认识，一致认为要开发万宝山，必须发展交通，大修道路，大造车船。在社党委统一领导下，组织群众一万二千人，苦战十天，修好了四条长达四十二公里的简易公路。全社十个大队有八个大队通了汽车。在开始大闹牛驮、牛车化时，一些抱有严重右倾保守思想的人指手划脚，冷言冷语的说：“自古以来牛耕田，鱼儿游岸哪里见，人参燕窝本是有，无钱不要心开天。”有的人甚至讲怪话，发谬论。面临着这一新生事物与右倾保守的尖锐斗争，各级党委采取了加强具体领导，组织思想论战，书记亲自挂帅，设计牛车，训练驮牛，做出样子，破除难关，总结经验，全面推广，不到半年时间，全州就基本上实现了牛车化，开始一人赶一牛一车，载重三百斤，日行二十五公里，现在已提高到一人赶二至三车，载重六百多斤，日行四十五至六十公里，大大地节省了运输劳力，对沟通内外物资交流，支援社会主义建设，起了重大的作用。
    大跃进的经验证明，根据“两条腿走路”的方针，积极地贯彻“以水运为主，水陆结合，土法为主，土洋结合”的交通建设方针，这是多快好省地发展山区交通运输事业的现实途径。事实证明，那里认真执行了这一方针，工作就争得主动，及时支援了工农业生产。反之，那里工作就跟不上，吃了大亏。我州龙山县交通运输发展的过程，就是用“两条腿走路”的实践过程。去年上半年有些物资运输部门，认为已修了公路，将大量的物资集运到公路沿线，等待汽车，结果物资积压，霉烂变质，国家财产遭到损失，生产受了影响。县委立即扭转了喜洋恶土，单靠汽车的思想，提出“土洋结合，车船并举”，发动群众向大小河流进军，大造木帆船、牛马车，苦战七十天，使全县条条河流实现船运化，把沿途积压的物资全部运出，难题迎刃而破。
    大跃进的经验还证明，大搞群众运动是迅速发展交通运输的根本方法，是贯彻执行总路线的生命线。我州各族人民对迅速改变交通落后面貌，有着特别迫切的要求。同时，也只有大搞群众运动，才能迅速改变交通落后状况。群众运动愈搞得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，交通运输就愈会有声有色，蓬勃发展。在大跃进中，我们在全州掀起了一个全民办交通的群众运动，去年10月的短途运输突击运动中，全州发动人数达一百二十万人次，扫清了全部积压物资。桑植县全民大动员进行“三光”（收光、调光、运光）竞赛，三天内发动四千九百六十六人，完成运输量五百五十二吨。保靖县葫芦公社实现牛驮化，五天训练八百多头牛。永顺县城郊公社，人人当艺匠，户户造车辆，苦战三昼夜，实现车子化。该县首车公社，发动群众，利用农闲，苦战三个月，在长达九十华里的枯水河道上，实现了航运化，群众歌唱道：
    猛洞河来猛洞河，猛洞河上船只多，
    一船装载几十担，肩背不再受折磨，
    幸福全靠共产党，八十老人笑呵呵。
    这些生动的事实，都有力的说明了群众运动的威力无穷，无往不胜。只要我们充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，交通运输面貌就会日新月异，奇迹万千。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命、实现半机械化和机械化是加速交通建设的重要关键，也是减人增产，高速度发展国民经济的主要途径，大跃进以来，我们在群众中开展了学、比、赶、帮的劳动竞赛热潮和不会就学，不懂就钻，不通就辩的革命办法，大大地破除了迷信保守思想和神秘观点，树立了敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格，促进新生事物的不断发展和壮大，生产连续上升，发明创造层出不穷。如我州泸溪车站、港口，根据不同操作方法，实行五大技术革新，配成了港口、车站搬运装卸土洋结合的机械化，将汽车、帆船的拨装工序扣在一起，创造了每载八吨汽车平均装载时间十五秒，装卸时间平均十分钟的新纪录，提高工效十至七十五倍，每日节省劳力五百多个，装卸运量由过去最高日产四百五十吨提高到二千吨。保靖县改良的两节船，上滩水险，将大船折成两节小船，下滩水平又连成大船，多装、快跑、又安全。像这样的人人革新，处处革新，标兵林立，万紫千红，有力地推动了交通运输邮电事业的飞跃发展。
    充分利用水力，实行综合利用，是开发山区，建设山区交通的重要环节。现在我们已把好些过去“千年不通航，涨水就成灾”的小河，经过大力整治，变成了“来往船儿穿如梭，旱河变成幸福河”，并实行综合利用，有利生产，造福人民。如桑植珠玑塔公社的官英贤小溪，河床狭窄，水流湍急，砂石杂乱，经过综合治理后，现在已能通航一吨以上的木帆船，沿岸建立水力动力站十五处，带动大小机器五十五座，进行加工，每天可节省劳力一百个，增灌农田三千六百亩，每年预计可增产粮食十八万斤。所以必须充分利用水能潜力，为国家创造出更多的物质财富。
    大跃进两年来的交通运输事业，发展是迅速的，成绩是巨大的，经验是丰富的，这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉胜利。今年是二十世纪六十年代的伟大起点。我州各族人民，在党的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，在过去两年连续大跃进的胜利基础上，加强共产主义大协作，要实现一个更大更好更全面的跃进。将在自治州飞起历史上的第一架飞机；将出现自治州第一条轻便铁路；在沅、澧、酉、武水河上机帆船将要往来驰驶；在高山上、工矿区、森林区将架设纵横的高空钢索道；在各港站码头将实现机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化的装卸工具，平地和山区数以万计的各种车辆奔驰。我州各族人民一定要以更大的革命干劲，以更高的建设速度来实现全州水陆空组成的四通八达的交通运输网，促进工农业生产的更大跃进，和全国各族人民一道，共同建设美好幸福的社会主义祖国大家庭。
    谨祝大会胜利成功！
