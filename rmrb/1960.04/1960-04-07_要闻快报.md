    Chongqing Workers Launch "Same as the Advanced" Campaign

    Recently, the broad masses of workers in Chongqing have launched a "Same as the Advanced Level" campaign. In this campaign, all trades and industries in the city have formulated "Same as" plans at all levels, determined to emulate the advanced levels and advanced figures in the same type of work and business nationwide, provincially, citywide, and within the factory, striving to be the same as the advanced. The goals proposed in the plan include all aspects such as production level, technological innovation, enterprise management, raw material saving, political and cultural learning, and leadership methods, with practical measures for each aspect. This has led the competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping to a new stage with greater momentum, more comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous. Now, a warm scene of "everyone striving to be the best, everywhere catching up with the advanced" has appeared throughout the city, promoting the development of the technological innovation movement and the general improvement of production levels.

    Harbin Mechanical Workers Engage in a Major Tool Reform

    In the technological innovation movement, many machinery factories and mechanical manufacturing and processing workshops in Harbin seized the most critical part of mechanical equipment, the tools, and learned from the experience of the "Tool Competition" created in Qiqihar, launching a tool reform movement of "seeking high speed from the tool tip and high output from the cutting edge."

    Through the "Tool Competition," Harbin has created and promoted more than 200 kinds of advanced tools such as multi-tool multi-edge and one-tool multi-purpose. The cutting efficiency of these tools is generally four times higher than in the past, and some have increased by 308 times.

    The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee and a "Tool Competition" on-site meeting at the Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, where it specifically summarized the experiences of various factories.

    Timely Application of Innovation Achievements to New Designs

    In the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute closely integrates the movement within the institute with the movement outside the institute, so that design work can fully absorb nutrients in this great movement. Their approach is: to organize designers to go deep into the reality of production, participate in the technological innovation movement of various relevant factories, and timely summarize and absorb new technological achievements and incorporate them into new designs, so that the new designs are more technologically advanced and economically more reasonable, and promote the level of design work of the entire institute to a new height; this approach is also a good way for designers to combine with workers and peasants and combine with the reality of production.

    Hubei Sows Cotton, Striving for Full Seedlings in One Go

    Hubei Province's 8.5 million mu of cotton is being sown in fine weather. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on farmers in cotton-producing areas throughout the province to ensure that sowing is done once, full seedlings emerge once, seedlings are neat and strong, and strive to have buds in May and produce more autumn cotton.

    People's communes in various places organized cadres, technicians, and members to seriously discuss and study the technical measures for "sowing once and having full seedlings once." The more common measures are: cotton seeds for sowing are selected by grain and treated with seed dressing, sowing in sunny and dry soil, even sowing and shallow covering, applying seed fertilizer, opening ditches to drain waterlogging, and lowering the groundwater level. At the same time, nutritional pots and nutritional blocks are prepared, and some even grow reserve seedlings on the sides of fields and at the ends of fields for use in replacing missing seedlings to ensure full seedlings.

    Anhui's Spring Planting Area Expanded by 60%

    Anhui Province's spring planting work has been vigorously launched. The province's sweet potato seedling cultivation has overfulfilled the task, early rice sowing and seedling raising is about to end comprehensively, and spring sweet potatoes, spring corn, millet, sorghum, cotton, hemp and other spring-sown crops have been planted on more than 1.7 million mu.

    In the spring planting, all parts of the province have conscientiously implemented the方針 of taking grain as the key link, making an all-round great leap forward, and planting more, producing high yields, and harvesting more, and actively adopted the strategic measure of expanding the spring planting area to ensure a greater leap forward in agriculture this year. The province plans to spring sow 44 million mu, an increase of more than 60% over last year, of which high-yield crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and corn account for more than 35 million mu, and cotton and tobacco have also been greatly expanded.

    Hunan Accelerates Hog Production

    This year, the hog production situation in Hunan Province is very good. The number of hogs in the province has been rising month by month, breaking the old pattern of hog production declining in the spring in previous years. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that to achieve the grand plan of one hog per person in the province this year, it is necessary to further accelerate the speed of hog production. The key to accelerating the speed is: 1. Persist in implementing the方針 of "walking on two legs," that is, focusing on public raising, combining public and private raising; combining large collectives and small collectives to raise pigs. The main way to complete this year's hog raising plan is to rely on large collectives to raise pigs, but the potential of canteens raising pigs cannot be ignored. 2. A large number of piglets will be born from April to June, so we must start early to solve the feed problem. 3. Formulate reasonable labor quotas and remuneration, and do a good job in regular epidemic prevention work.

    要闻快报
    重庆职工开展“一个样”运动
    重庆市广大职工最近开展了一个“和先进水平一个样”的运动。在这一运动中，全市各行各业都层层制定了“一个样”的规划，立志向全国的、全省的、全市的和全厂的同工种、同业务的先进水平和先进人物看齐，作到和先进一个样。规划中提出的奋斗目标，包括生产水平、技术革新、企业管理、原材料节约、政治和文化学习、领导方法等各个方面，每个方面都有切实的措施。这样就使比、学、赶、帮的竞赛跨入了一个声势规模更大、更全面、深入和细致的新阶段。现在，全市到处都出现了“人人争上游，处处赶先进”的热烈景象，促进了技术革新运动的发展和生产水平的普遍提高。
    哈尔滨机械工人大闹刀具改革
    哈尔滨市许多机械厂和机械制造、加工车间，在技术革新运动中，抓住了机械设备最关键的刀具部分，学习齐齐哈尔市创造的“赛刀会”的经验，开展了“向刀尖要高速，向刀刃要高产”的刀具改革运动。
    通过“赛刀会”，哈尔滨市已创造和推广了多刀多刃、一刀多用等二百多种先进刀具。这些刀具的切削效率，一般比过去提高四倍，有的提高了三百零八倍。
    中共哈尔滨市委曾在哈尔滨第一机械厂召开了常委扩大会议和“赛刀会”现场会，对各个工厂的经验作了专门总结。
    及时把革新成果用于新设计
    西北工业建筑设计院在技术革新和技术革命运动中，把院内运动同院外运动密切结合起来，使设计工作在这一伟大的运动中能充分地吸收养料。他们的作法是：组织设计人员深入生产实际，参加各有关工厂的技术革新运动，及时总结和吸取新的技术成果，纳入新设计，这样便使新的设计在技术上更先进，经济上更合理，把全院设计工作的水平推进到一个新的高度；这种作法也是设计人员同工农群众结合，同生产实际结合的好方式。
    湖北播棉力争一次全苗
    湖北省八百五十万亩棉花正在抢晴播种。中共湖北省委号召全省棉区农民要保证做到一次播种，一次全苗，苗齐苗壮，力争五月现蕾，多结伏桃。
    各地人民公社组织干部、技术员和社员们认真讨论研究了“一次播种，一次全苗”的技术措施。比较普遍的措施是：播种的棉籽经过粒选和药剂拌种，抢晴爽土播种，匀播浅盖，施盖籽肥，开沟排渍，降低地下水位。同时搞好营养钵和营养块，有的还在厢边、地头育预备苗，以备缺苗递补，保证全苗。
    安徽春播面积扩大60％
    安徽省春播工作已经蓬勃展开。全省甘薯育苗超额完成了任务，早稻播种育秧即将全面结束，春甘薯、春玉米、谷子、高粱、棉花、麻类等春播作物，已经栽种一百七十多万亩。
    在春播中，全省各地都认真贯彻了以粮为纲、全面跃进和多种、高产、多收的方针，积极采用扩大春播面积这条战略性的增产措施，以保证今年农业更大跃进。全省计划春播面积四千四百万亩，比去年扩大60％以上，其中水稻、山芋、玉米等高产作物达三千五百多万亩，棉花、烟叶也扩种很多。
    湖南养猪生产加快速度
    今年湖南省养猪的生产形势很好，全省养猪头数逐月上升，打破了历年春季养猪下降的老规律。中共湖南省委认为，今年全省要实现一人一猪的宏伟计划，需要进一步加快养猪生产的速度，加快速度的关键在于：一、坚持贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，即以公养为主，公养私养并举；以大集体为主，大集体小集体养猪并举，完成今年的养猪计划主要靠大集体养猪，但是也不能忽视食堂养猪的潜力。二、四到六月仔猪将大量出生，要及早动手解决饲料问题。三、制订合理的劳动定额和报酬，做好经常性的防疫工作。
