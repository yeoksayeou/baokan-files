Hunan Province's Party committees at all levels, since October of last year, have trained over two million peasant technicians in water conservancy construction, soil survey, plant protection, meteorological observation, animal husbandry and aquaculture, forestry production, and the use of new agricultural implements, from the province to the county, commune, and brigade, in batches and at different levels, based on the mass line of self-reliance and walking on two legs. This is more than double the number of last year. Now, these peasant technicians are playing a significant role in spring plowing production.

In the past two years, Party organizations at all levels in Hunan Province, based on the new situation in the high-speed development of agricultural production throughout the province, which has put forward higher requirements for science and technology, and based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, have taken revolutionary measures, launched mass movements on a large scale, and trained a large number of peasant technicians quickly, well, and economically, expanding the agricultural science and technology team. Secretaries of Party organizations at all levels personally took command and established agricultural science research institutions and training organizations at each level.

In the work of training peasant technicians, various regions have adopted a combination of professional training and large-scale mass movements. The training forms are diverse, including various short-term training classes held by provinces, special districts, and counties in batches and phases; on-site meetings and technical performance meetings to summarize and promote experience; and various spare-time technical schools, etc. In addition to lectures by high and middle-level technical personnel from full-time schools, the training mainly adopts the method of learning from those who are capable, with masters leading apprentices, the old leading the new, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and common improvement. Various regions widely use on-site meetings, technical performance meetings, and mobile technical performance meetings. More than 600,000 rice transplanter operators trained throughout the province this spring were mostly trained in this way.

The work of training peasant technicians is closely integrated with current production, starting from production, learning what is needed, learning and doing at the same time, and growing talents in practice. Last October, when the province was engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction, various regions adopted the method of taking the construction site as the classroom and the project as the teaching material, learning while constructing, and training a large number of peasant technicians. In just four months, more than 180,000 peasant water conservancy technicians were trained, averaging one or two technicians per production team in the province's more than 130,000 production teams. Most of the 30,000 new reservoirs built throughout the province last winter and this spring were designed and constructed by these peasant technicians. After acceptance, they generally met the specifications. In the past, these projects had to be designed and constructed by water conservancy engineering technicians from the province and special districts. He Zuli, a peasant water conservancy technician from Chetou Commune in Daoxian County, has mastered all the techniques of surveying, designing, and constructing small and medium-sized water conservancy projects through short-term training classes, continuous spare-time self-study, and practical exercises. Last winter, he was responsible for the engineering and technical guidance of three reservoirs, and the quality fully met the requirements. He also created and imitated eight kinds of construction tools, greatly saving labor. Everyone called him a "water conservancy expert."

The large-scale training of peasant water conservancy technicians has opened up a new situation for the comprehensive training of various peasant technicians in agricultural production. Hydrological and meteorological personnel used to be cultivated with a certain level of education and relatively long-term study, but last winter and this spring, more than 100,000 people were trained throughout the province. All of the province's more than 17,000 production brigades have established meteorological outposts, and most production teams and work groups have established weather observation groups.

Using the method of launching mass movements on a large scale to train cadres not only quickly produced a large number of peasant technicians, ensuring the technical needs of the high-speed development of agricultural production, but also quickly set off a nationwide upsurge in learning technology through this technical backbone team.

In the current spring plowing production campaign, this huge technical force has already played a huge role. This year, rice seed soaking in the province has a higher technical operating procedure, generally adopting a combination of insect pest reporting stations, meteorological stations, technical extension stations, and fine seed farms to guide seed soaking and seedling cultivation.

At present, the province is establishing and improving technical leadership organizations at all levels around spring plowing production, requiring that from the commune to the brigade, production team, and work group, there should be a deputy specifically in charge of this work. Actively expanding the ranks of peasant technicians, giving full play to the role of existing peasant technicians, and adhering to the principle of combining popularization with improvement, focusing on consolidating and improving the batch of peasant technicians who have been trained, organizing them to continuously learn, continuously practice, and continuously improve, and laying a good foundation for building a modern agricultural technology team. (Zhuo Kangning, Yi Dihang)

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei. The Patriotic People's Commune in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, closely combined with production and adopted the method of popularization and improvement to cultivate more than 18,000 technicians in more than a year.

Most of this huge scientific and technological force are farmers with rich production experience, and some are primary school graduates who participate in production. Now, they generally master scientific and technical knowledge such as crop cultivation and management, pest and disease control, livestock breeding and reproduction, and soil improvement. Among them, more than 1,700 people can conduct various crop test comparisons, technical analysis, field observation records, simple soil analysis, pest and disease forecasting and research experiments. Old farmers Zhao Shiying, Song Youxiang, etc., learned to use microscopes to check plant pathogens and understand the properties and preparation of various pesticides. Gao Xiaobiye (Higher Primary School Graduate) Yao Weiye, with the help of technicians, studied diligently and applied what he learned, and mastered scientific and technical knowledge in crop cultivation, soil improvement, fertilizer properties, meteorology, and other aspects in more than a year, reaching the level of intermediate technician.

After the establishment of the Patriotic People's Commune, the Commune Party Committee immediately began to cultivate scientific and technological forces. First, an agricultural science research institute was established, absorbing more than 70 higher primary school graduates participating in production to participate as the base point for commune scientific research, cultivating technicians, and promoting advanced science and technology. At the same time, each production brigade and team absorbed production experts to establish 13 technical promotion stations and 649 technical research groups, and established experimental fields and indigenous pesticide and indigenous fertilizer plants.

After the formation of the science and technology network, the Commune Party Committee promptly merged the science research institute and the commune's two agricultural middle schools as a base for commune scientific research, cultivating technicians, and promoting advanced science and technology. According to the needs of specialization of commune production, the students of agricultural middle schools and the backbone of promotion stations and technical research groups were divided into professional classes such as crops, cash crops, poultry and livestock, and soil improvement. Teaching adopts a method that emphasizes both basic courses and professional courses to improve the level of technicians in a planned and step-by-step manner. Continue to adopt fixed learning, batch learning, and point-to-point teaching for general technicians to improve the level of science and technology. In order to better carry out scientific research and learn advanced science and technology, the experimental field has been expanded to more than 1,000 mu; more than 1,000 indigenous pesticide and indigenous fertilizer plants have been established; and a 10,000-head pig, 1 million-chicken, duck, and goose factory each have been established. The number of research projects has been expanded from 150 to 420. 48 people were also sent to the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Fuyang, Zhengyangguan, and other places to learn biogas utilization, meteorology, agriculture, horticulture, indigenous pesticides and indigenous fertilizers, poultry and livestock breeding and other technologies.

The scientific and technical team cultivated by the Patriotic Commune has not been around for long, but it has played a great role in production. The commune has universally promoted the institute's successful experiments in improving soil with methods such as guest soil, paddy field flooding, deep plowing, and application of more organic fertilizers, improving more than 20,000 mu of soil; making the land that "doesn't get your feet wet when it rains, and rabbits don't poop," the average yield per mu reached 520 jin last year.

Now, the technicians of the Patriotic People's Commune are using advanced science and technology to cultivate rice seedlings and sweet potato seedlings, strengthen field management, predict and forecast pests and diseases, vigorously manufacture indigenous pesticides and indigenous fertilizers, and breed poultry and livestock, and other work, striving for the continued leap forward in commune production this year.

    湖南涌现二百多万农民技术员
    安徽爱国公社农民技术员成为生产跃进的尖兵
    本报讯　湖南省各级党委从去年10月以来，根据自力更生和两条腿走路的群众路线的方针，从省到县、公社、大队分级分批培训了水利施工、土壤普查、植物保护、气象观测、畜牧水产、林业生产以及使用新式农具的能手等各种农民技术员共二百多万人，比去年扩大了两倍多。现在，这批农民技术员在春耕生产中已发挥很大作用。
    两年来，湖南省各级党组织根据全省农业生产的高速度发展对科学技术提出了更高的要求的新情况，根据两年来大跃进的经验，采取了革命的措施，大搞群众运动，大量培训农民技术员，多快好省地扩大农业科学技术队伍。全省各级党组织的书记亲自挂帅，层层成立了农业科学研究机构和培训组织。
    各地在培训农民技术员的工作中，采取了专业训练和大搞群众运动相结合的办法，训练的形式多种多样，有省、专、县各级分批分期举办的各种短期的训练班；有总结经验、推广经验的现场会和技术表演会；还有各种业余技术学校等等。训练中除了全日制学校中的高、中等技术人员讲课外，主要是采取能者为师，以师带徒，以老带新，互教互学，共同提高。各地广泛采用现场会、技术表演会和流动技术表演会，全省今春训练的六十多万名插秧机手，大部分是这样训练出来的。
    培训农民技术员的工作是和当前生产紧密结合进行的，从生产入手，做什么学什么，边学边做，从做中增长才干。去年10月，全省大搞水利建设的时候，各地就采取了以工地为课堂，以工程为教材，边施工边学习的方法，大量培训农民技术员。只四个月时间，就培训出十八万多个农民水利技术员，全省十三万多个生产队，平均每个生产队有一个或二个技术员。去冬今春，全省新建设的三万座水库，大部分是由这些农民技术员设计和施工的，经过验收，一般都合乎规格，而过去这些工程都要由省、专区的水利工程技术人员去负责设计施工。道县车头公社农民水利技术员何祖礼，通过短期训练班和不断业余自学以及实践锻炼，已掌握了中、小型水利工程的勘察、设计、施工的全部技术。去年冬天他负责三座水库的工程技术指导，质量完全符合要求，并创造和仿制施工工具八种，大大节约了劳动力，人人称他是“水利专家”。
    大量的培训农民水利技术员，为全面培训农业生产各种农民技术员的工作打开了新局面。水文气象员过去是有一定文化水平和比较长时间的学习才能培养出来的，而去冬今春全省就培训了上十万人，全省一万七千多个生产大队，都建立了气象哨，大部分生产队和作业组都建立了观天小组。
    用大搞群众运动的办法来培训干部，不仅很快的涌现了大批农民技术员，保证了高速度发展农业生产对技术的需要，而且通过这支技术骨干队伍，迅速地掀起了全民学习技术的热潮。
    当前春耕生产运动中，这一支庞大的技术队伍，已经发挥了巨大的作用。全省今年水稻浸种，有了更高的技术操作规程，一般采取了虫情站、气象站、技术推广站、良种场四结合的办法，指导浸种育秧工作。
    目前，全省正在围绕春耕生产，层层建立和健全技术领导机构，要求自公社到大队、生产队、作业组，都要有一个副职专门领导这一工作。积极扩大农民技术员的队伍，充分发挥现有农民技术员的作用，并且坚持普及与提高相结合的方针，大抓已经培训出来这一批农民技术员的巩固提高工作，组织他们不断学习，不断实践，不断提高，为建立一支现代化的农业技术队伍打下良好的基础。（卓康宁、易涤颃）
    本报讯　安徽省寿县爱国人民公社紧密结合生产，采取普及与提高的办法，在一年多时间内，培养出一万八千多名技术员。
    这支庞大的科学技术队伍，绝大部分是富有生产经验的农民，还有一些是参加生产的小学毕业生。现在，他们一般都能掌握作物栽培和管理，防治病虫害，牲畜饲养和繁殖，土壤改良等科学技术知识。其中有一千七百多人能作各种农作物的试验对比，技术分析，田间观察记载，土壤简便分析，病虫害的预测预报和研究试验。老农赵世英、宋友香等，学会用显微镜检查植物的病菌，懂得各种农药的性能和配制。高小毕业生姚为业，在技术员帮助下，苦学苦钻，边学边用，在一年多时间内，掌握了作物栽培、土壤改良、肥料的性能、气象等多方面的科学技术知识，已达到中级技术员的水平。
    爱国人民公社建立后，社党委立即着手培养科学技术力量。首先成立了农业科学研究所，吸收七十多名参加生产的高小毕业生参加，作为公社科学研究、培养技术员、推广先进科学技术的基点。同时，各生产大队、小队吸收生产能手，建立十三个技术推广站，六百四十九个技术研究小组，并建立试验田和土农药、土化肥厂。
    科学技术网形成后，社党委又及时把科学研究所和公社两所农业中学合并，作为公社科学研究、培养技术员和推广先进科学技术的基地。根据公社生产专业化的需要，把农业中学的学生和推广站、技术研究小组的骨干划为农作物、经济作物、家禽家畜、土壤改良等专业班。教学采用基础课和专业课并重的办法，有计划有步骤地提高技术员的水平。对一般技术员继续采用固定学、分批学、分点传授等办法，提高科学技术水平。为了更好的开展科学研究和学习先进科学技术，试验田扩大到一千多亩；建立土农药、土化肥厂一千多个；建立万头猪、百万只鸡、鸭、鹅厂各一个。研究项目由一百五十个扩大到四百二十个。还派出四十八人到省农业科学研究所和阜阳、正阳关等地学习沼气利用、气象、农业、园艺、土农药和土化肥、家禽家畜饲养等技术。
    爱国公社培养的这支科学技术队伍，虽然时间不久，可是在生产上已发挥了很大作用。公社普遍推广研究所试验成功的用客土、沤田、深耕、多施有机肥等改良土壤的办法，改良土壤二万多亩；使“下雨不沾脚、兔子不拉屎”的土地，去年亩产平均达到五百二十斤。
    现在，爱国人民公社技术员们，正在运用先进的科学技术，培育稻秧和山芋苗，加强田间管理，病虫害的预测、预报，大力制造土农药、土化肥，繁殖家禽家畜等工作，为今年公社生产持续跃进而奋斗。
