    The Foreign Ministry of the People’s Republic of China Replied to India on the Sino-Indian Border Issue on April 3rd
    Reaffirming that the Entire Sino-Indian Border Has Never Been Formally Demarcated; Satisfactory Resolution Can Be Achieved Through Friendly Consultation, Mutual Understanding and Mutual Accommodation
    The Differences Between the Two Countries on the Border Issue are Local and Temporary Issues; the Thousand-Year, Ten-Thousand-Year Friendship and Cooperation Between the Two Peoples is a Fundamental Issue
  The World-Renowned Sino-Indian Premier Meeting is About to Begin; It is Hoped That Both Sides Will Strive to Ensure That the Expectations of the People Concerned About Sino-Indian Friendship Will Not Be Disappointed
    Xinhua News Agency, April 14. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Embassy of the Republic of India in China on April 3, 1960. The full text of the note is as follows:
    Beijing
    Embassy of the Republic of India
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Embassy of the Republic of India and has the honor to state the following:
    The Chinese government has received the Embassy's note of February 12, 1960, and has studied it carefully. The Indian government stated in the note that, for the benefit of the two countries and world peace, positive steps must be taken to eliminate the causes of the current tension and to establish a solid foundation for friendship between the two countries, and believes that the two governments must agree without delay on an arrangement to completely eliminate the danger of border conflicts and facilitate the friendly resolution of disputes. This is consistent with the consistent wishes of the Chinese government, and the Chinese government expresses its heartfelt welcome.
    Regarding the facts of the Sino-Indian border and the position of the Chinese government, the Chinese government has made detailed and comprehensive statements in its note of December 26, 1959. The Indian government has raised many different views in its note. However, the various objections raised by the Indian government in its note cannot shake the facts provided in the aforementioned Chinese note and the position of the Chinese government, and the premiers of the two countries will soon meet in New Delhi. Therefore, the Chinese government does not intend to respond to each point raised in the above-mentioned note from the Indian government. This note will only provide some necessary explanations on several major issues and some facts to which the Indian government has raised objections, as a supplement to the Chinese government's note of December 26, 1959. The Chinese government is clarifying these issues and facts not for the sake of argument, but in the hope of promoting the Indian government's understanding, narrowing the differences between the two sides, and thus contributing to the meeting between the premiers of the two countries.
    For the convenience of writing, this note will continue to use the concepts of the western, middle, and eastern sections of the Sino-Indian border as described in the note of December 26, 1959.
    I. Whether the Sino-Indian Border Has Been Demarcated and Whether It Needs to Be Formally Demarcated
    (1) The Indian government does not accept the argument that the entire Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated and that there are no border treaties or agreements between China and India, but it cannot provide any facts to refute it. The Indian government admits that the 1842 treaty did not demarcate the western section of the border, but argues that this section of the border has been determined since the seventeenth century, but still cannot provide any treaty basis for demarcating this section of the border. Regarding the middle section, the Indian government admits that there is no border treaty at all. Regarding the eastern section, the Indian government can only cite the Simla Treaty between Britain and the Tibetan local authorities in 1914 and the secret exchange of letters between the two parties regarding the so-called McMahon Line, but the Chinese government has long argued that these two documents are illegal and invalid, and the Simla Conference did not discuss the issue of Sino-Indian boundary demarcation at all. Based on the above, it is an indisputable fact that there are no border treaties or agreements between China and India, and the entire Sino-Indian border has not been formally demarcated.
      (2) The Indian government said that the entire Sino-Indian border, as is well known, runs along the main watershed, and that according to international practice, customary borders along such unchanging natural terrain are considered to be stipulated and do not need to be formally stipulated by both parties. The Chinese government cannot agree with this argument. First of all, the Chinese government has long argued that the so-called entire Sino-Indian traditional customary border runs along the well-known main watershed is unfounded. Secondly, according to universally recognized principles, an international boundary line marks the dividing line between adjacent countries in exercising sovereignty over their respective territories, and it must be jointly stipulated by the countries concerned. Therefore, even if some parts of the Sino-Indian traditional customary line have relatively obvious natural terrain, their starting and ending points and specific locations still need to be jointly stipulated by both parties. Thirdly, even Britain in the past did not put forward the claim that the Sino-Indian border does not need to be formally stipulated. This can be proven by the following facts. Britain once suggested to China in 1899 to stipulate the boundary between Kashmir (including Ladakh) and Xinjiang. Between 1921 and 1927, it conducted negotiations with China on demarcating the boundary between Ladakh and Tibet. This negotiation was not, as the Indian government claimed, merely to resolve the issue of the ownership of a few pastures. In 1914, it also secretly and illegally drew a so-called McMahon Line on the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border with the Tibetan local authorities. If, according to the Indian government, the Sino-Indian border does not need to be formally demarcated at all, then why did Britain repeatedly ask China to demarcate the various sections of the border between China and India in the past? It can be seen that the claim that the Sino-Indian border does not need to be formally stipulated is untenable.
      (3) Since, according to internationally recognized standards, the boundaries between adjacent countries must be jointly stipulated by both parties, any unilateral declaration of its national boundary line or change in the boundary drawing method on the map by any party in any way is obviously not legally effective and is not binding on the relevant neighboring countries. As for unilaterally destroying the traditional customary line and expanding the scope of occupation, this naturally cannot constitute a legitimate basis for acquiring territory. The Chinese government has always adhered to this position on the Sino-Indian border issue. It can be recalled that: First, the successive governments of China have never recognized Britain's territorial claims on the Tibetan and Xinjiang regions of China; Second, at and after the Simla Conference, the Chinese government clearly stated that it did not recognize the treaties or similar documents signed by Britain and the Tibetan local authorities at that time and in the future; Third, the Chinese government and the Tibetan local authorities have repeatedly protested and negotiated against Britain's past illegal actions of destroying the Sino-Indian traditional customary line and invading Chinese territory; Fourth, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government also clearly stated to the Indian government that there was an unsettled border issue between China and India and that China has never recognized the so-called McMahon Line. Regarding these facts, the Chinese government's note of December 26, 1959, made a detailed description. However, the Indian government has repeatedly asserted that the Chinese government has never raised objections to Britain's unilateral claims regarding the Sino-Indian border inherited from Britain, that the Chinese government has never protested against foreign invasions of its territory, and that the Chinese government did not suddenly change its position on the Sino-Indian border issue until September 1959, etc. This is something that the Chinese government finds surprising and incomprehensible.
    (4) The Indian government also argued that since the two sides did not request to discuss the border issue in the Sino-Indian negotiations in 1954, this proves that the border issue no longer exists. This argument is also untenable. If it is believed that an outstanding issue that was not mentioned in a certain negotiation automatically becomes non-existent, it is illogical and incomprehensible. Moreover, the Chinese government repeatedly stated from the beginning of the negotiations that this negotiation was only to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries that had already matured, and the Indian representatives also expressed their agreement. It can be seen that the 1954 negotiations did not resolve or attempt to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries. As for saying that without resolving the border issue, it is impossible for India and the Tibetan region of China to establish normal relations on a new basis, this is also untenable. The so-called establishing normal relations between India and the Tibetan region of China on a new basis mainly refers to the fact that after China and India gained liberation and independence respectively and established diplomatic relations, the situation where India held the privileges left by Britain in Tibet must be changed, and the relationship between China and India in the Tibetan region of China should be handled in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As for the unsettled border issue between the two countries, as long as both parties are willing to maintain the status quo of the border before it is resolved, it will not hinder the establishment of normal relations between the two parties. There are many examples of this internationally.
    (5) Based on the above, it can be seen that China and India have never signed any border treaties or agreements to formally demarcate the borders of the two countries. The Chinese government's proposal that the governments of the two countries hold comprehensive negotiations on the border issue and reach a border agreement is completely reasonable. It is obviously incorrect to describe the Chinese government's proposal as requiring a "new" border agreement to replace the "old" agreement or requiring the "re-"determination of the borders of the two countries.
    II. Individual Issues Related to Each Section of the Border - Western Section of the Border
      (1) Facts related to ownership and exercise of jurisdiction. The Indian government does not agree with the argument that the relevant areas of the western section of the border have historically belonged to China and not to India, but it has not provided any strong counter-evidence. In particular, the Indian government has never provided any reason to explain such a bizarre situation, that is, since 1950, Chinese personnel and materials have frequently crossed this area back and forth between Xinjiang and Tibet, and a north-south highway has been built, while the Indian government, which claims to exercise jurisdiction over this area and has been sending personnel to patrol regularly, has long been unaware of this.
      (2) Regarding maps. The Indian government said that Chinese maps before the 1920s showed the boundary more or less in accordance with the current Indian maps, and only changed the drawing method after that; it also said that Chinese maps of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries clearly showed that Xinjiang never extended south of the Kunlun Mountains. These statements are unfounded. The fact is that many Chinese geographical gazetteers since the eighteenth century, especially some authoritative ones, such as the "Da Qing Yi Tong Zhi" of 1784 and the "Jiaqing Chongxiu Da Qing Yi Tong Zhi" of 1820, all stated that the boundary of Xinjiang extends to the mountains southwest of the source of the Karakash River, which is the Karakoram Mountains. This is basically consistent with the drawing method of the current Chinese maps, but inconsistent with the drawing method of the Indian maps. As for a "Chinese Postal Map" published in 1917 mentioned by the Indian government, it was drawn without the consent of the Chinese authorities by the French and British imperialist elements who controlled the Chinese postal service at that time. Indians who, like the Chinese, have suffered from colonialist aggression for a long time should easily understand that this map does not represent the views of the Chinese, but only the views of the imperialist elements.
    The Indian government said that the maps or records of British surveyors and some travelers who visited this area in the nineteenth century are consistent with the currently published maps of India, which is also inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the maps and records of these people showed great contradictions and confusion before and after. This situation precisely illustrates the historical fact that Britain has been privately tampering with the boundary drawing method for more than 100 years in order to invade Xinjiang and Tibet. Nevertheless, some of them still correctly reflected the actual situation of the border to varying degrees. The Chinese government has pointed out that John Waker and Hayward and Robert Shaw mentioned by Prime Minister Nehru in his letter had a similar understanding of the border to the traditional drawing method of Chinese maps. The Indian government cannot deny this point, but the Indian government denies their authority and insists that the surveys of Johnson and the Second Yarkand Expedition are authoritative. But this is also untenable. Taking Johnson as an example, he even had obvious errors in topographic surveying, which was pointed out in the book "Lands of Snow" written by the Director of the Survey of India, Mason, published in 1955. Johnson's map also groundlessly marked the Sino-Indian boundary line to the north of Saitula in Xinjiang, that is, about 150 kilometers deeper into Chinese territory to the north than the boundary line on the current Indian map. I am afraid that even the Indian government would not agree with this drawing method.
      Middle Section of the Border
    Regarding the disputed locations in this section of the border, the Indian government has not put forward any new arguments. The Chinese government only wants to add some points on the issue of Poling Sumdo. The Indian government said that Poling Sumdo is not the same place as Polansungdo, but the same place as Polin. This is inconsistent with the facts. The fact is that Poling Sumdo is the place generally read as Polansungdo by India. It is not difficult to see that Polansungdo is just a variant of Poling Sumdo. And Polin is completely another place, and has never been called Poling Sumdo at the same time. In the note attached to Prime Minister Nehru's letter of September 26, 1959, the Indian government also clearly admitted that Poling Sumdo is Polansungdo under Indian control.
    Eastern Section of the Border
      (1) Historical facts related to jurisdiction. The Indian government stated that it could not accept the argument that the entire area south of the so-called McMahon Line, including the three components of Monyul, Loyu, and Lower Zayul, has historically belonged to China, and that China has exercised jurisdiction over it until recently. The Indian government tried to prove that this entire area has always belonged to India. However, the various reasons recently listed by the Indian government are also untenable.
      (A) First, in the Monyul region, the Tibetan local authorities not only exercised religious powers recognized by the Indian government, but more importantly, exercised administrative powers. In this regard, the Chinese government has cited many examples to prove it. It can also be cited that Ward, a British geographer who once conducted explorations in the Sino-Indian eastern border area, although groundlessly said in his article "Assam Himalaya: Travels in the Balipara" published in the Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society in 1938 that in 1913-1914, the Monyul region, including Tawang, "has been ceded to India," but he had to admit that not only before this, Monyul, especially Tawang, was "within the Tibetan administrative system," but also until he arrived in Monyul in 1938, "Tibetan administration continued." Secondly, regarding the Lower Zayul region, including Walong, not only do Tibetan people live there, but it has always been under the jurisdiction of Tibet. In 1944, the British army illegally invaded Walong. After the Tibetan local government sent a representative of the Sang-ngag Choling Dzongpon to negotiate, the British army withdrew. As for the Loyu region located between the Monyul and Lower Zayul regions, the Tibetan local government extensively established administrative institutions at all levels and collected taxes there, which is also completely based on facts.
      (B) The Indian government claimed that the area south of the so-called McMahon Line was ruled by the Varman, Salastambha, and Pala dynasties rather than Tibet as far back as the eighth century, but it did not provide any factual basis. The claim that the Ahom dynasty controlled this area from the thirteenth century is also incorrect. The scope of rule of the Ahom dynasty only extended to the plain area on the north bank of the Brahmaputra River, and never reached the southern foothills of the Himalayas. It can be clearly seen from the first chapter and attached maps of the book "British Relations with Assam" published in 1949 by the Department of Historical and Archaeological Research of the Government of Assam, India, that the Himalayas and the foothills inhabited by the Aka, Dafla, Abor, and Mishmi people are all north of Assam's border, not within its border. As for the various agreements that the Indian government has repeatedly mentioned that Britain concluded with some tribes in this area since the nineteenth century, it is not difficult to see from the clauses of the agreements that they are only agreements on non-aggression or acceptance of British economic assistance, and cannot be used as the basis for the attribution of these tribes to Britain and India.
      (2) Whether the so-called McMahon Line has legality. The Indian government did not emphasize the claim that the Simla Treaty is binding on the Chinese central government, because the Chinese central government did not sign the treaty at all, let alone ratify it (although the Chinese representative Chen Yifan once initialed the draft treaty, he stated that this was not a formal signature, and that the formal signature had to be approved by the Chinese government, and the Chinese government immediately stated that this initial was invalid). This fact cannot be denied no matter what. However, the Indian government focused on arguing that: (A) The Simla Conference discussed the so-called McMahon Line; (B) The Tibetan local government has the right to sign treaties alone. The Chinese government is willing to further clarify these two issues.
      (A) Article 9 of the Simla Treaty does not involve the Sino-Indian border, and the attached map of the treaty does not mark the Sino-Indian border. This point is easier to identify if it is linked to the following facts. First, the Indian government has never been able to cite on which day of the Simla Conference and on which page of the conference record the issue of discussing the Sino-Indian border, especially the so-called McMahon Line, appeared. It is obviously unimaginable that the issue of the attribution of such a large area of territory was stipulated in the treaty and the attached map without any discussion. Secondly, the map attached to the Simla Treaty does not mark the boundary line between China and India. It is impossible to find any textual basis in all the documents of the conference to insist on interpreting a specific part of the red line marked on the map (which is used to indicate the boundary between Tibet and other parts of China) as a section of the Sino-Indian border.
    (B) It is absolutely indisputable that the Tibetan local authorities have no right to conduct negotiations with foreign countries and sign treaties alone. Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, and China enjoys full sovereignty over Tibet. The Tibetan local authorities have no right to conduct negotiations with foreign countries and sign treaties without the authorization and consent of the Chinese central government; even if they do so, it is illegal and invalid. Even the British government in the past did not dare to ignore this point. The Anglo-Tibetan Treaty of 1904 cited by the Indian government—which Britain forced the Tibetan local authorities to sign through war—is an example. It can be recalled that after forcing Tibet to sign this treaty, Britain repeatedly asked the Chinese government to sign and ratify it. After repeated negotiations on this issue, it was not concluded until China and Britain signed another treaty in 1906 and the above-mentioned Anglo-Tibetan Treaty was attached as an annex. As for the secret exchange of letters between the British representative and the representative of the Tibetan local authorities regarding the so-called McMahon Line during the Simla Conference in 1914, it was carried out behind the back of the Chinese central government and kept secret from the outside world for a long time, and the Chinese government had already made a general statement during the Simla Conference, not recognizing the treaties and similar documents signed by Britain and the Tibetan local authorities. Therefore, this exchange of letters is even more illegal and invalid.
                    ×　×　×
    The Chinese government hopes that the above will help to further clarify the following facts about the border, that is: the entire Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated; the areas currently disputed by both sides have historically belonged to China and not to India, and a considerable part of them is still under the effective control of the Chinese government. However, the Chinese government is willing to repeat that it has always hoped to seek a reasonable solution to the border issue through friendly consultations with the Indian government, so that the two sides will no longer have any disputes on the border issue. In the eyes of some people, the differences between China and India are almost impossible to resolve. The Chinese government does not agree with this view. The Chinese government believes that no matter how great the current differences between China and India on this particular issue are, compared to the fundamental issue of the two peoples needing a thousand-year, ten-thousand-year friendly cooperation, it is ultimately a local and temporary issue. As long as both sides take the fundamental interests of friendship between the two countries and world peace as the most important thing, hold sincerity, adhere to friendly consultation and the Five Principles, and adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, then they will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve a satisfactory solution to the border issue for both sides. Although the Chinese government has repeatedly stated the border facts and its own position, it has never put forward preconditions for the discussions between the two sides. The Chinese government is willing to jointly explore various ways to resolve the differences with the Indian government in a conciliatory and reasonable manner during the discussions, and do its best to promote the success of the discussions.
    The Chinese government has always advocated that before the border issue is resolved, both sides maintain the status quo of the border, maintain the tranquility of the border, and do not allow this temporarily unsettled issue to affect the consolidation and development of friendly relations between the two countries. The Chinese Government has always treated the Sino-Indian boundary question with extreme prudence and has never taken any steps which might lead to conflict and tension on the border. The temporary tension and unfortunate incidents that occurred on the border between the two countries last year were completely unexpected and unprepared for China. Since then, the Chinese government has immediately taken measures and made proposals to ensure the tranquility of the border and prevent the use of force and the occurrence of conflicts. The Indian government also expressed in its note of February 12, 1960, its hope that the two governments would agree without delay on an arrangement to eliminate the danger of border conflicts and facilitate the friendly settlement of various disputes, which is welcome. The Chinese government hopes that the various proposals put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai in his letter of December 17, 1959, can be accepted by the Indian government as the basis for this agreement, because the above-mentioned proposals were drafted on the basis of full consideration of the various proposals previously put forward by both sides. The Chinese government also hopes that the two sides will not stop at this step, but will further work together to make an arrangement for a comprehensive solution to the border issue, so that the people of the two countries will no longer feel confused and uneasy about the border issue.
    Thanks to the efforts of the governments and peoples of China and India, the tense relationship between China and India in the previous period has improved, which is gratifying and encouraging. Now, the world is watching the upcoming meeting between the premiers of the two countries. The Chinese people, the Indian people, and all peace-loving people in the world who are concerned about the friendship between China and India have high expectations for this historic meeting. Indeed, the importance of this meeting and the great responsibilities of the two governments cannot be overestimated. The Chinese government hopes that both China and India can have a full understanding of this and make the greatest efforts so that the expectations of the people of the two countries and all those who are concerned about the friendship between the two countries will not be disappointed. Of course, the Chinese government will never neglect that there are still difficulties on the road ahead, and there are still some people with ulterior motives who are doing everything possible to provoke and undermine the relationship between the two countries and hinder the success of the talks. However, the Chinese government firmly believes that if the two governments can meet each other with sincerity and strive to create conditions, they will be able to quickly resolve the border disputes between the two countries, and the great friendship between the two countries will not only not be shaken, but will be further consolidated and developed.
    Please accept the highest respect.

    中华人民共和国外交部四月三日就中印边界问题复照印方
    再度阐明中印两国整个边界从未正式划定  只要双方友好协商互谅互让定能满意解决
    两国在边界问题上的分歧是局部性暂时性问题，两国人民千年万年友好合作是根本问题
  举世瞩目的中印总理会谈即将开始，希望双方努力使关心中印友好的人民的期望不致落空
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国外交部1960年4月3日给印度共和国驻华大使馆照会一件，照会全文如下：
    北京
    印度共和国驻华大使馆
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度共和国驻华大使馆致意，并谨申述如下：
    中国政府收到了大使馆1960年2月12日的照会，进行了认真的研究。印度政府在照会中表示，为了两国和世界和平的利益，必须采取积极步骤，来消除引起目前紧张局势的原因和建立两国间友谊的坚实基础，并且认为两国政府必须不迟延地协议一项安排，来完全消除产生边境冲突的危险，并且便利对各项争端的友好解决。这是同中国政府的历来愿望相一致的，中国政府表示衷心的欢迎。
    关于中印边界的事实和中国政府的立场，中国政府在1959年12月26日的照会中已经作了详尽的和全面的陈述。印度政府在来照中提出了许多不同的观点。但是，印度政府在来照中提出的各种异议并不能动摇上述中国照会所提供的事实和中国政府的立场，而且两国总理不久即将在新德里会晤，因此中国政府不拟对印度政府上述来照所提出的各点一一作出答复。本照会将只就印度政府提出异议的若干主要问题和一部分事实作某些必要的说明，作为对中国政府1959年12月26日照会的补充。中国政府澄清这些问题和事实仍然不是为了争论，而是希望促进印度政府的了解，缩小双方的分歧，从而有助于两国总理的会晤。
    为了行文的方便，本照会仍将使用在1959年12月26日照会中所说明的关于中印边界西段、中段和东段的概念。
    一、中印边界有没有划定和需不需要正式划定
    （一）印度政府不接受关于整个中印边界从未正式划定、中印之间没有边界条约和协定的论断，但是举不出任何反驳的事实。印度政府承认1842年条约并没有划定西段边界，但是又辩称这段边界是从十七世纪以来就确定了的，可是依然举不出划定这段边界的条约根据。关于中段，印度政府承认根本不存在什么边界条约。关于东段，印度政府只能举出1914年英国和西藏地方当局之间的西姆拉条约和他们双方关于所谓麦克马洪线的秘密换文，但是中国政府早已论证这两个文件是非法的、无效的，而且西姆拉会议根本没有讨论中印划界问题。基于以上所述，中印之间没有任何边界条约或协定，中印边界全部未经正式划定，已是无可争辩的事实。
      （二）印度政府说，全部中印边界，如所周知，是沿着主要的分水岭的，并且说，根据国际惯例，沿着这种不变的天然地形的习惯边界就算是规定了的，不需要双方再正式规定。这个论点是中国政府所不能同意的。首先，中国政府早已论证，所谓全部中印传统习惯边界是沿着众所周知的主要分水岭的说法是没有根据的。其次，根据国际公认的原则，国际边界线标志着毗邻国家在各自领土上行使主权的分界线，它必须由有关国家共同加以规定。因此，即使中印传统习惯线的某些部分具有比较明显的天然地形，它们的起讫点和具体位置也仍然需要由双方共同加以规定。第三，甚至是英国在过去也没有提出过中印边界无需正式规定的主张，这可从以下事实得到证明。英国曾经在1899年建议同中国规定克什米尔（包括拉达克）和新疆之间的边界。在1921到1927年间，它同中国进行关于划定拉达克和西藏之间的边界的谈判，这一谈判并不是如印度政府所断言的，仅仅为了解决少数几块牧场的归属问题。在1914年，它还同西藏地方当局秘密地、非法地画了一条关于中印边界东段的所谓麦克马洪线。如果按照印度政府的说法，中印边界根本无需正式划定，那么，英国过去为什么接二连三地要求同中国划定中印间的各段边界呢？由此可见，所谓中印边界无需正式规定的说法是不能成立的。
      （三）既然按照国际公认的准则，毗邻国家间的边界必须由双方共同规定，那么，任何一方以任何方式片面地宣布它的国界线或者改变地图的边界画法，显然是不具有法律效力的，对有关邻国也是没有约束力的。至于以片面行动破坏传统习惯线，扩大占领范围，这自然更不能构成取得领土的合法根据。中国政府在中印边界问题上历来就坚持这种立场。可以忆及：第一、中国的历届政府从来不承认英国对中国西藏和新疆地方的领土要求；第二、在西姆拉会议上和会议后，中国政府明确声明不承认英国和西藏地方当局当时和他日所签订的条约或类似的文件；第三、中国政府和西藏地方当局对于英国过去破坏中印传统习惯线、侵占中国领土的非法行动，屡屡提出了抗议和交涉；第四、中华人民共和国成立后，中国政府也明确地向印度政府说明中印之间存在着未定界问题和中国从来不承认所谓麦克马洪线的立场。关于这些事实，中国政府1959年12月26日的照会曾经作了详细的叙述。但是，印度政府却一再断言，中国政府对英国遗存下来的关于中印边界的片面主张从来没有提出过异议，中国政府对领土遭到外来侵占从来没有提出过抗议，中国政府直到1959年9月才忽然改变自己对中印边界问题的立场等等，这是中国政府感到诧异和不可理解的。
    （四）印度政府还争辩说，既然在1954年的中印谈判中双方没有要求讨论边界问题，这就证明边界问题已经不存在。这个论点同样是不能成立的。如果认为一个悬而未决的问题在某一次谈判中没有被提到，就自动地变成不存在了，那是不合逻辑的，也是不可理解的。而且，中国政府从谈判开始就一再说明，这次谈判只是解决两国间业已成熟的悬而未决的问题，印度代表也表示同意。可见1954年谈判并没有解决或者试图解决两国间的一切悬而未决的问题。至于说边界问题不解决，印度同中国西藏地方就不可能在新的基础上建立正常关系，这也是不能成立的。所谓在新的基础上建立印度和中国西藏地方的正常关系，这主要是指在中印两国分别获得解放和独立，并且建立了外交关系以后，印度在西藏持有英国遗留下来的特权的状况必须改变，中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系问题应该按照和平共处五项原则来处理。至于两国间的未定界问题，在未获解决以前，只要双方愿意维持边境的现状，也并不妨碍双方正常关系的建立，这在国际间有不少的实例。
    （五）基于以上所述，可见中印之间从来没有签订过任何边界条约或协定来正式划定两国的边界。中国政府主张两国政府就边界问题举行全面谈判和达成边界协议是完全有道理的。把中国政府的主张说成是要求达成什么“新”的边界协议以代替“旧”的协议或是要求“重新”确定两国边界，显然是不正确的。
    二、有关各段边界的个别问题西段边界
      （一）有关归属和行使管辖的事实。印度政府不同意西段边界的有关地区历来属于中国而不属于印度的论断，但是它没有举出任何有力的反证。尤其是印度政府始终没有举出任何理由来说明这样一种离奇的情况，就是1950年以来，中国的人员和物资一直频繁地穿越这个地区往返于新疆和西藏之间，并且修建了一条纵贯的公路，而自称对这个地区行使管辖并且一直派有人员定期巡逻的印度政府，却长期对此毫无所知。
      （二）关于地图。印度政府说，中国地图直到本世纪二十年代以前，对这段边界的画法还同现行印度地图或多或少相符，只是在此以后才改变了画法；还说，十八、十九世纪的中国地图清楚地表明新疆从来没有延伸到昆仑山脉以南。这些说法都是没有根据的。事实是，十八世纪以来的许多中国地理图志，特别是一些有权威的，如1784年的“大清一统志”和1820年的“嘉庆重修大清一统志”，都载明新疆的境界及于喀拉喀什河河源西南的山脉，这就是喀喇昆仑山脉，这同现行中国地图对边界的画法是基本一致的，而同印度地图的画法并不一致。至于印度政府所提到的一张1917年出版的“中国邮政图”，它是由当时把持中国邮政事业的法英帝国主义分子，在不征得中国当局同意下擅自绘制的。同中国人一样曾经长期受过殖民主义侵略的印度人应该容易了解，这张图并不代表中国人的观点，而只代表帝国主义分子的观点。
    印度政府说，十九世纪访问过这个地区的英国勘测人员和一些旅行家的地图或记载都同印度现行出版的地图相符，这也不符合事实。事实上，这些人的地图和记载前后表现了很大的矛盾和混乱。这种情况正好说明了一百多年以来英国为了侵略新疆和西藏而不断私自窜改边界画法的历史事实。尽管如此，其中有些人仍然在不同程度上正确地反映了边界的实际情况。中国政府曾经指出，约翰·瓦克和尼赫鲁总理来信中提到过的海华德和罗伯特·肖对边界的认识就接近于中国地图的传统画法。这一点印度政府也无法否认，可是印度政府又否定他们的权威性，硬说约翰逊和第二次叶尔羌调查团的调查才是权威性的。但是，这也不能成立。以约翰逊为例，他甚至对地形测量都有明显的错误，这在1955年出版的印度测量局局长马松所著的“冰雪之乡”一书中就曾指出过。约翰逊的图还毫无根据地把中印边界线标到新疆的赛图拉以北，即比现在印度地图上的界线更向北深入中国领土约一百五十公里，这种画法恐怕连印度政府也是不会同意的。
      中段边界
    关于这一段边界的各争议地点，印度政府没有提出任何新的论据，中国政府只想就波林三多这一个问题做些补充。印度政府说，波林三多同波兰松多不是一个地方，而同波林是一个地方。这不符合事实。事实是，波林三多就是印度一般读为波兰松多的地方，不难看出，波兰松多只是波林三多的变音。而波林则完全是另外一个地方，从来也没有同时被称呼为波林三多。在尼赫鲁总理1959年9月26日信件所附的注释中，印度政府也明白承认波林三多就是印度控制下的波兰松多。
    东段边界
      （一）有关管辖的历史事实。印度政府表示不能接受所谓麦克马洪线以南包括门隅、洛渝和下察隅三个组成部分的整个地区历来属于中国，而且直到不久以前还由中国行使管辖的论点。印度政府力图证明这整个地区一向属于印度。但是，印度政府新近列举的种种理由也都是不能成立的。
      （甲）首先在门隅地区，西藏地方当局不仅行使印度政府也承认的宗教职权，更重要的是行使行政职权。在这方面中国政府已经举过许多事例足资证明。还可举出，曾经在中印东段边境地带进行探测活动的英国地理学家华德在1938年发表在皇家中亚细亚学会杂志上的“阿萨姆喜马拉雅：在巴里巴拉的旅行”一文中虽然毫无根据地说，在1913—1914年，包括达旺在内的门隅地区“已割让给印度”，但是，他也不得不承认，不仅在此以前，门隅特别是达旺是“在西藏的行政系统之内”，而且直到他1938年到达门隅的时候，“西藏的行政管理还继续着。”其次，关于包括瓦弄在内的下察隅地区，则不仅居住着藏族人民，而且历来属西藏管辖。1944年英军非法侵占瓦弄，经西藏地方政府派桑昂曲宗宗本的代表进行交涉，英军才撤退。至于处于门隅和下察隅地区之间的洛渝地区，西藏地方政府在那里广泛设有各级行政机构和征收赋税，也是完全有事实根据的。
      （乙）印度政府声称，所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区在遥远的八世纪以前是由瓦曼、萨拉斯塔姆巴和帕拉王朝而不是由西藏统治，可是，并没有举出任何事实根据。所谓从十三世纪起阿霍姆王朝控制了这个地区的说法，也是不确实的。阿霍姆王朝的统治范围仅及于布拉马普得拉河北岸的平原地区，从未到达喜马拉雅山的南麓。从印度阿萨姆省政府所属的历史考古研究部1949年出版的“英国与阿萨姆关系”一书的第一章和附图中，可以清楚地看出，喜马拉雅山脉以及居住着阿卡人、达夫拉人、阿波人和密闪密人的山麓地带都是在阿萨姆的境界以北，而不在它的境界以内。至于印度政府一再提到的十九世纪以来英国同这个地带的某些部落所缔结的各个协定，那不难从协定的条文中看出，它们只是关于互不侵犯或接受英国经济援助的协定，不能作为这些部落归属英国和印度的依据。
      （二）所谓麦克马洪线是否具有合法性。印度政府没有再强调西姆拉条约对中国中央政府具有约束力的说法，因为中国中央政府根本没有在条约上签字，更没有加以批准（中国代表陈贻范虽然曾经在条约草案上草签，但是声明这不是正式签字，正式签字须经中国政府批准，而中国政府也立即声明这个草签无效），这个事实是怎样也否认不了的。但是印度政府着重争辩说：（甲）西姆拉会议讨论过所谓麦克马洪线；（乙）西藏地方政府有权单独订约。中国政府愿意进一步澄清这两个问题。
      （甲）西姆拉条约的第九条并没有涉及中印边界，条约的附图并没有标出中印边界，这一点如果联系到以下事实就更容易辨明。首先，印度政府始终没有能够举出在西姆拉会议的哪一天和会议记录的哪一页上出现过讨论中印边界特别是所谓麦克马洪线的问题。关于一个涉及到面积如此之大的领土归属问题竟然没有经过任何讨论就在条约和附图上被规定下来，这显然是不可想像的。其次，在西姆拉条约的附图上，并没有标绘中印之间的界线。硬要把图上标明的红线（它是用以表示西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线的）的某一特定部分解释为中印边界的一段，这从会议的全部文件中也找不到任何文字的根据。
    （乙）西藏地方当局无权同外国单独进行谈判和签订条约，这是绝对不容争辩的。西藏是中国领土的一部分，中国对西藏享有完全的主权。西藏地方当局如果不经中国中央政府的授权和同意，无权同外国进行谈判和签订条约；即使这样做了，也是非法的、无效的。这一点，甚至过去的英国政府也不敢忽视。印度政府所举的1904年的英藏条约——它是英国通过战争强迫西藏地方当局签订的——就是一个例子。可以忆及，英国在强迫西藏签订这个条约后，还一再要求中国政府签字批准。这个问题经过反复交涉，直到1906年中英另订条约，并且把上述英藏条约作为附件之后，才算告一段落。至于1914年西姆拉会议期间，英国代表和西藏地方当局代表关于所谓麦克马洪线的秘密换文，它是瞒着中国中央政府进行的，并且长期对外保守秘密，而中国政府在西姆拉会议期间已经作了一般性的声明，不承认英国和西藏地方当局签订的条约和类似文件，因此这个换文更是非法的、无效的。

    中国政府希望，以上所述将有助于进一步澄清有关边界的下述事实，这就是：整个中印边界从未正式划定；双方目前有争议的地区历来属于中国，不属于印度，而且其中相当大的一部分迄今还在中国政府的有效控制之下。但是，中国政府愿意重复地说，它始终希望同印度政府经过友好协商，求得边界问题的合理解决，使双方不再在边界问题上有任何争端。在一些人看来，中印双方的分歧几乎是无法解决的，中国政府不同意这种意见。中国政府认为，无论中印双方目前在这一个特定问题上分歧有多么大，但是比起两国人民需要千年、万年友好合作这样一个根本性质的问题来说，终究是一个局部性的和暂时性的问题。只要双方以两国友好和世界和平的根本利益为重，抱有诚意，坚持友好协商和五项原则，采取互谅互让的态度，那么，一定可以克服一切困难，使边界问题得到双方满意的解决。尽管中国政府曾经一再陈述边界事实和自己的立场，但是从来没有对双方的讨论提出先决条件。中国政府愿意在讨论中以和解和合理的态度同印度政府共同探讨解决分歧的各种途径，尽力促进讨论的成功。
    中国政府一向主张，在边界问题没有解决以前，双方维持边境的现状，保持边境的安宁，不使这个一时未决的问题影响两国友好关系的巩固和发展。中国政府一向以极其审慎的态度对待中印边界问题，从未采取任何可能导致冲突和边境紧张局势的步骤。去年在两国边境上一时出现紧张局面和不幸事件，对于中国说来，是完全出乎意料的和毫无准备的。此后，中国政府立即采取措施和提出建议，以求确保边境的安谧，防止使用武力和发生冲突。印度政府在1960年2月12日的来照中同样表示希望两国政府不迟延地协议一项安排，来消除产生边境冲突的危险并且便利对各项争端的友好解决，这是值得欢迎的。中国政府希望，周恩来总理1959年12月17日信中所提出的各项建议能为印度政府所接受，作为此项协议的基础，因为上述建议是在充分考虑了双方前此所提的各项建议的基础上拟就的。中国政府还希望双方并不停顿于这一步骤而能进一步共同努力为边界问题的全面解决做出一项安排，使两国人民不再为边界问题感到困惑和不安。
    由于中印两国政府和人民的努力，中印之间前一时期的紧张关系已经有所改善，这是令人宽慰和鼓舞的。现在，举世都瞩目于即将到来的两国总理的会晤，中国人民、印度人民以及世界上一切爱好和平和关心中印两国友好的人民都对这次历史性的会晤怀着殷切的期望。的确，这次会晤的重要性和两国政府的重大责任是怎样估计也不会过高的。中国政府希望，中印双方对此能够有充分认识，并且尽最大的努力，使两国人民以及一切关心两国友好的人民的期望不致落空。当然，中国政府绝不忽视，在前进的道路上还有困难，世界上还有一些别有用心的人在千方百计地挑拨和破坏两国关系，阻挠会谈的成功。但是，中国政府坚定不移地相信，两国政府如能相见以诚，努力创造条件，就一定能够使两国的边界争端迅速得到解决，而两国之间的伟大友谊也就不仅不会动摇，而且将会进一步地巩固和发展。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
