Fellow Representatives:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and I am determined to implement them resolutely. These two reports are extremely inspiring. They provide a profound scientific analysis of the great significance and rich experience of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, using Mao Zedong Thought, and they offer significant theoretical value. They make reasonable arrangements for this year's magnificent construction plan. All of these provide great inspiration for us to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in our practical work.

Both reports emphasize "agriculture as the foundation" and "industry as the leading factor," clearly pointing out that "agriculture has an extremely important role in the development of the national economy, and it is the foundation of the national economy. Faster development of agriculture can not only guarantee faster development of light industry, but also guarantee the priority development of heavy industry." This is absolutely correct, and Qinghai feels this especially deeply. Therefore, I will now make a speech only on the issue of how Qinghai should develop agricultural production. Any inappropriate points, please correct me.

Qinghai is a place with vast land and abundant resources, and a relatively sparse population. It is rich in minerals, abundant in grasslands, and has a lot of reclaimable wasteland, which is extremely beneficial for the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. After surveying only one-third of the province's land area, a large number of mineral deposits have been discovered, with a variety of minerals, and generally characterized by high grade, large reserves, and wide distribution. It is fully capable of becoming a base for petroleum, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, and the chemical industry in the motherland. However, to make full use of these resources, it is necessary to greatly increase the population; to increase the population, it is necessary to vigorously develop agriculture and increase grain production. In Qinghai, the way to increase grain production is to expand the cultivated land area and increase the yield per unit area. At present, the total grain output has increased 2.4 times compared with 1949, the sown area has expanded by nearly one time, and the water area has expanded six times. However, these are still not enough to meet the needs of various construction and development projects. Therefore, our provincial Party committee has decided to vigorously reclaim wasteland, build farmland water conservancy projects, and increase grain production in order to accelerate Qinghai's various socialist construction projects.

A large amount of Qinghai's wasteland is in pastoral areas. However, the pastoral areas have a particularly sparse population, and the herdsmen have no habit or experience in managing agriculture. Based on this specific situation, we have adopted the following methods for large-scale land reclamation:

One, vigorously run state-owned farms, use tractors centrally, and take state-owned farms as the main force for land reclamation. State-owned farms shoulder important tasks in land reclamation. This year, the province will reclaim 8.8 million mu of wasteland, and state-owned farms will be responsible for reclaiming 5 million mu, and will play a demonstrative role for herdsmen in reclaiming and planting land. Otherwise, it would be impossible to reclaim more than 40 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. At present, 56 state-owned farms have been established throughout the province, and considerable achievements have been made. They own more than 20% of the province's total cultivated land area (including newly reclaimed wasteland from last winter and this spring), and their grain output in 1959 accounted for 13% of the province's total grain output. Most farms have established industries such as sugar making, winemaking, oil extraction, agricultural product processing, and machinery repair. After the education campaign to break superstitions and liberate thinking, the vast number of cadres and workers have mustered their energy, dared to think, and dared to act. In the Gaqu Farm, which is 3,500 meters above sea level and has no absolute frost-free period, 6,500 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland also achieved a large-area high yield of 1,200 jin of grain per mu on average. The Delingha Farm in the Qaidam Basin has always maintained the glorious title of a thousand-jin farm. In 1959, the average yield of 13,000 mu of wheat was 1,057 jin per mu, and the average yield of 16,000 mu of peas was 621 jin per mu. In addition, while continuously expanding the construction of old farms and training cadres, we are also actively building new farms by using the method of "hens laying eggs" and gradually increasing immigrants. This can not only ensure the continuous development of old farms, but also accelerate the construction of new farms.

Two, adhere to the combination of year-round land reclamation and shock land reclamation. Land reclamation, like other work, must combine regular land reclamation with shock land reclamation. In 1959, adhering to the principle of taking grain as the key link in agriculture, we made comprehensive arrangements for various tasks. After the autumn harvest, we organized several battles in a timely manner, and organized 50% of the labor force of state-owned farms, ranches, and people's communes to reclaim land and build water conservancy projects. In just over two months, 3.83 million mu of wasteland was reclaimed, equivalent to half of the province's cultivated land area at the time of liberation, and the irrigated area was expanded by 2.6 million mu, equivalent to 2.7 times the total amount of land reclaimed in the province in the ten years since liberation, and equivalent to 2.5 times the total irrigated area in the more than 400 years before liberation.

Three, organize people's communes to actively reclaim land. Reclaim land nearby if there is wasteland nearby; if there is no wasteland nearby, organize expeditions to mountainous areas and pastoral areas with more land and fewer people to reclaim land. As a result, people's communes reclaimed more than 2.4 million mu of land in 1959, and ten counties and forty-one people's communes in the thirty-five counties and one hundred and twenty-two people's communes in the pastoral areas achieved grain self-sufficiency. This not only freed them from their historical dependence on grain from agricultural areas, but also laid a good foundation for them to better develop various economic and cultural activities.

Four, organize agencies, troops, schools, and urban residents to carry out large-scale land reclamation. They are required to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and meat, and at least self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. Last year, many agencies achieved two self-sufficiencies, three self-sufficiencies, and five self-sufficiencies. This year, it is required that the average staff member, including family members, should reclaim one mu of wasteland, hand in 200 jin of grain, 720 jin of vegetables, and one pig for every two people, etc. Many farms have now been established and are striving to realize this call from the provincial Party committee.

Through the above efforts, the province's sown area can be expanded to 11 million mu this year. It is planned to reclaim 8.8 million mu of new wasteland and build 3.5 million mu of farmland water conservancy projects, so that the sown area next year will be expanded to 20 million mu, in order to quickly solve the grain problem needed for Qinghai's construction. After the anti-rightist campaign and the encouragement of vigor, and after the "rectification movement with the struggle between the two roads and socialist education as the key link," the awareness of the vast number of cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. They are full of energy and ambition to conquer nature and transform nature, and put forward the slogan of turning "alkali land into Qinchuan, grasslands into Jiangnan, and Gobi deserts into rice fields." Cadres can also go to the front lines to participate in production, lead production, and eat, live, and work with the masses. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses is even greater. They issued the heroic words of "mobilizing the whole party and the whole people, the secretary taking the lead and going to the front line, wearing out hands, sweating, and not going down the mountain until the task is completed." Red flags are waving everywhere, and people are bustling with activity. The socialist competition of "learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and surpassing" is surging.

1960 is the first year of the great 1960s, and it is a year in which my country's socialist construction will achieve greater victories. In order to guarantee the comprehensive and better leap forward of the national economy in 1960, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai are determined to resolutely implement the spirit of this conference in this great year, in order to achieve more brilliant victories. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and adhering to the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, Qinghai Province's national economy in 1960 will surely achieve a high-speed leap forward.

    青海省要大力开荒
    袁任远代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，并且坚决贯彻执行。这两个报告是十分振奋人心的。对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大意义和丰富经验，运用毛泽东思想作了精辟的科学分析，提供了重大的理论价值；对于今年建设的宏伟计划作了合理的安排。这些都对我们在实际工作中学习和运用毛泽东思想给了极大的启发。
    两个报告都强调了“农业为基础”，“工业为主导”，明确地指出“农业对于发展国民经济有着极端重要的作用，它是国民经济的基础。农业更快地发展了，不但可以保证轻工业更快的发展，而且可以保证重工业的优先发展”。这是十分正确的，青海对此感受尤深。因此，现在，我仅就青海如何发展农业生产的问题，作一发言。不妥之处，请大会予以指正。
    青海是一个地大物博、人口比较稀少的地方。矿藏丰富、草原丰美、宜垦荒地多，对于发展工、农、牧业极为有利。仅在全省三分之一的土地面积内经过勘察，就已发现大批矿点，多种矿种，而且一般具有品位高、储量大、分布广的特点。完全有条件成为祖国的石油、有色金属、黑色金属和化学工业基地。但是，要充分利用这些资源，就要大量增加人口；要增加人口，就必须大力发展农业，增产粮食。在青海来说，增产粮食的办法，就是扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量。现在，粮食总产量较1949年增长了二点四倍，播种面积扩大将近一倍，水地扩大六倍。但是，这些还都不能满足各项建设发展的需要。因此，我们省委决定大力开垦荒地，兴修农田水利，增产粮食，来加速青海的各项社会主义建设。
    青海的大量荒地在牧业区。而牧业区却系人口特别稀少，牧民又无经营农业的习惯和经验。根据这一具体情况，我们对于大量垦荒采取了以下几种办法：
    一、大办国营农场，集中使用拖拉机，以国营农场为垦荒的主力。国营农场在垦荒中担负着重要任务，今年全省要垦荒八百八十万亩，国营农场就担负着垦荒五百万亩的任务，并且对牧民垦荒种地发挥示范作用。否则，要想把四千多万亩宜垦荒地开垦出来是不可能的。现在，全省已建立起五十六个国营农场，并已取得了相当成绩。它们拥有耕地占全省总耕地面积的20％以上（包括去冬今春新垦荒地在内），1959年粮食产量为全省粮食总产量的13％，大部分农场都兴办了制糖、酿酒、榨油、农产品加工、机械修配等工业。经过破除迷信，解放思想的教育运动，广大干部和职工鼓足干劲，敢想、敢干，在拔海三千五百米，没有绝对无霜期的尕曲农场，也有六千五百亩新垦荒地，获得了粮食平均亩产一千二百斤的大面积丰产，柴达木德令哈农场几年来一直保持着千斤农场的光荣称号，1959年全场一万三千亩小麦平均亩产一千零五十七斤，一万六千亩豌豆，平均亩产六百二十一斤。此外，我们在不断扩大老场建设和培养干部的同时，又以母鸡下蛋的方法积极建设新场，陆续增加移民。这样既能保证老场不断地发展，又加速了新场建设。
    二、坚持长年垦荒和突击垦荒相结合。垦荒也同其它工作一样，要使经常性的垦荒和突击性的垦荒结合起来。1959年，我们本着农业以粮为纲的方针，对于各项工作进行了全面安排，在秋收后，及时组织几个战役，把国营农场、牧场，人民公社50％的劳动力组织起来开荒地、修水利。在仅仅两个多月内，就开垦荒地三百八十三万亩，等于解放时全省耕地面积的一半，扩大灌溉面积二百六十万亩，相当于解放时全省耕地面积的一半，扩大灌溉面积二百六十万亩，相当于解放十年来开荒总和的二点七倍，相当于解放前四百多年所有灌溉面积总和的二点五倍。
    三、组织人民公社积极垦荒。就近有荒地的，就近开垦；就近没有荒地的，就组织远征队到地多人少的山区和牧业区去开。这样做的结果，在1959年人民公社垦荒二百四十多万亩，并在牧业区的三十五个县、一百二十二个人民公社中，有十个县、四十一个人民公社实现了粮食自给。这不仅是摆脱了他们从历史上对农业区粮食的依赖，而且对于他们更好的发展各种经济和文化奠定了良好的基础。
    四、组织机关、部队、学校和城市居民大搞开荒。要求他们实现粮、菜、肉食三自给，最低要实现菜、肉两自给。去年已有不少机关实现了两自给、三自给、五自给。今年要求机关工作人员包括家属在内，平均每人要开荒一亩，交粮二百斤，菜七百二十斤，两人一头猪等，现在已经办起了不少农场，正在为实现省委的这一号召而奋斗着。
    经过上述努力，今年全省的播种面积可以扩大到一千一百万亩。计划新垦荒地八百八十万亩，兴修农田水利三百五十万亩，使明年的播种面积扩大至两千万亩，以求很快的解决青海建设所需要的粮食问题。经过反右倾、鼓干劲，
  “以两条道路斗争和社会主义教育为纲的整风运动”之后，广大干部和群众的觉悟大大提高了一步，他们的干劲十足，抱着征服自然、改造自然的雄心大志，提出把“碱地变秦川，草原变江南，戈壁变成米粮川”的口号。干部也都能亲赴前线，参加生产、领导生产，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。因而，群众的干劲就愈大。发出了“全党全民总动员，书记带头上前线，手磨烂，汗流干，不完成任务不下山”的豪言壮语。到处是红旗招展，人声鼎沸。抢困难、让方便，“学、比、赶、超”的社会主义竞赛风起云涌。
    1960年是伟大的六十年代的第一年，是我国社会主义建设将取得更大胜利的一年。为了保证1960年国民经济全面的、更好跃进，青海各族人民决心在这伟大的一年里，坚决贯彻执行此次大会的精神，以求获得更辉煌的胜利。我们坚信，在党中央的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，青海省的1960年国民经济一定会获得高速度的跃进。
