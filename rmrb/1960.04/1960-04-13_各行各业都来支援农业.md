Editorial:
    Under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, China's agricultural production is advancing with continuous leaps forward. 1960 will be a year of continued and comprehensive great development for China's agricultural production. The 1960 National Economic Plan approved by the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress stipulates that the total agricultural output value should increase by 12% compared with last year; among the main agricultural products, both grain and cotton are required to increase by about 10% compared with last year. At the same time, this session of the National People's Congress also adopted the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 and called for its realization two or three years ahead of schedule. To achieve this great task, it is necessary not only to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes and continue to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, requiring agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and aquatic product departments to work hard, but also to require all departments and trades and professions, such as industry, transportation, finance, banking, trade, science, education, culture, health, and sports, to regard supporting agriculture as an important task within their own responsibilities and launch a larger-scale mass movement of comprehensive support for agriculture from all trades and professions across the country.
    All departments and trades and professions supporting agriculture is not only an important guarantee for striving for continued and comprehensive great development in agricultural production but also of great significance for striving for a more comprehensive and better leap forward in the entire national economy. China's experience in socialist construction, especially the experience since the Great Leap Forward, has repeatedly proved that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the simultaneous high-speed leap forward in industrial and agricultural production can lead to a comprehensive and high-speed leap forward in the national economy. China is a large agricultural country, and the countryside is not only a vast market for industrial development but also a vast base for grain and raw materials for industry. Only with great agricultural development can we make increasingly large demands for agricultural means of production and means of livelihood to industry, and only with great agricultural development can we promote the great development of heavy industry and provide sufficient raw materials for the great development of light industry. The great development of industry and agriculture will inevitably bring about the great prosperity of transportation, commerce, science, education, culture, health, sports, and other aspects of work. Therefore, supporting agriculture is not only for producing more grain, cotton, and various agricultural and sideline products but also for producing more steel, building more machines, producing more cotton cloth, and running more schools… This is a major issue related to the vital interests of the 650 million people across the country and is an important task closely related to the development of various departments of the national economy.
    All trades and professions in cities are more advanced than those in rural areas in terms of material technology or science and culture. To summarize, urban support for agriculture means taking the acceleration of agricultural technical transformation as the center. All trades and professions, according to the characteristics of their own departments, revolve around the needs of the comprehensive and great development of agriculture, and help the development and improvement of various undertakings in rural areas, especially production undertakings, from their respective posts in a planned way in terms of material, technology, and experience. Industrial departments should incorporate the task of supporting agriculture into their own production plans, produce more and better agricultural machinery, farm tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and other means of production and daily consumer goods; the main products must be guaranteed to be completed on time, in quantity, and with quality, to meet the needs of agricultural production; at the same time, they should send workers and technicians to support county and commune industries, organize service teams to impart technical experience, and help communes train technical cadres; under possible conditions, they should also provide material support to help communes run factories well. Transportation departments must first ensure that they transport goods as needed and without delay, according to the needs of agricultural production and life; at the same time, they should actively help rural areas develop local railways and various folk transportation tools. Commercial departments should adapt to the needs of agriculture, take the initiative to help people's communes run industries on a large scale, use local materials, manufacture on the spot, supply on the spot, rely on their own efforts, and solve the production and repair of some farm tools; at the same time, they should actively do a good job in supply work, providing services to the communes, teams, fields, and plots, ensuring supply, and purchasing in a timely manner, without delaying the farmers' production time. Financial and banking departments should actively organize and ensure the timely supply of funds needed for agricultural development, expand investment in production, and promote the comprehensive development of diversified operations in agriculture; at the same time, they should also help people's communes improve their financial systems. Scientific and educational work should also face agricultural production, carry out scientific research work according to the needs of agricultural production, help rural areas solve urgent scientific and technological problems in production in a timely manner, help rural areas develop mass agricultural scientific research work, and develop science and technology and education. Cultural, health, and sports departments should also help rural areas carry out mass cultural and recreational activities, run nurseries, commune hospitals, and other undertakings well, and carry out mass sports activities. Now, many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have begun to universally organize urban-rural pairing and factory-commune pairing and have developed from the industrial departments of cities to various trades and professions universally pairing and cooperating with counties and communes, providing support according to the needs of the communes and the possibilities of factories and mines and other units. Urban and rural areas jointly formulate plans, sign support contracts, give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of both parties, and form a socialist competition upsurge of common leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Facts have proved that developing industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas into a nationwide mass movement, and adopting the form of separate pairing to establish fixed cooperative relationships, is of great significance both in the present and in the long term. Urban industry, transportation, finance, banking, trade, science, education, culture, health, and other departments allocate a certain amount of strength to face the countryside and respectively pair with counties and communes, which is a powerful measure to accelerate agricultural technical transformation and rural socialist construction, and it is also a new form of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, which should be vigorously promoted and universally implemented.
    On the basis of comprehensively carrying out the mass movement of all departments and trades and professions supporting agriculture, it is necessary to adopt the practice of grasping both ends and driving the middle to carry out the technical transformation of agriculture. At present, the focus of support should be placed on areas with relatively high grain yield and commodity rate and areas with relatively large agricultural production difficulties, helping them to realize agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization as soon as possible, helping them to develop comprehensively, so that low-yield areas can catch up with high-yield areas, and high-yield areas can reach a new level. To comprehensively realize agricultural mechanization in China's rural areas is our unwavering policy, and the time will not be too far away. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, although our industry has a considerable foundation, it is still not developed enough. Supporting agriculture to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization can only be carried out actively in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner. Agricultural labor must be transformed from mainly manual operation to the complete realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized operation, according to the principle of combining needs and possibilities, distinguishing between primary and secondary, grasping the key points, driving the general, and proceeding in a planned, step-by-step, and active manner. The so-called key points are also relative, not immutable, and must shift with the development and changes of the situation. Which type of area should become the key to accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization at present? This requires overall consideration from the national and provincial levels. Generally speaking, it is more appropriate to grasp both the high-yield areas and the low-yield areas. With the development of socialist construction, especially modern industry, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas is constantly increasing, and the demand for commodity grain supplied by rural areas is increasing. In the future, for a certain period of time, the large amount of commodity grain provided to the state will mainly rely on the original high-yield areas and the newly established commodity grain bases. These areas are still mainly based on manual operation and animal power cultivation, and labor productivity is not very high, and the potential for increasing production is still very large. In order for these high-yield areas to increase production more substantially, in addition to continuing to resolutely rely on the masses and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, it is urgently needed to take a step ahead in realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization and rapidly transfer agricultural production to a new technical foundation. After these areas widely use advanced agricultural machinery, they can liberate a large number of agricultural labor forces to actively develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, vigorously develop diversified operations, and promote the comprehensive and great development of agriculture. At the same time, high-yield areas can generally completely solve the funds needed for realizing agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, which is also a very important favorable condition. Looking at the low-yield areas with more difficulties in agricultural production at present, the local people are diligent, brave, and full of energy, and they have a very strong desire to quickly get rid of the backwardness of "poverty and blankness." Under the leadership of the Party in the past few years, agricultural production has also been greatly improved. However, due to historical reasons and some temporary factors of natural conditions, there are more economic difficulties, the industrial foundation is relatively weak, the situation of more land and fewer people and lack of labor force is more prominent, and there is greater potential in agricultural production, which needs to be further explored. In order to rapidly and thoroughly change the backwardness of these areas, so that the economic development of various types of areas tends to balance at a new level, or shorten the gap, in addition to mainly relying on the unremitting efforts and hard work of the broad masses of people in these areas, the state provides necessary support under possible conditions, and cities and advanced areas provide strong support, helping them to accelerate the pace of realizing agricultural mechanization, which is completely necessary. With a little assistance on the basis of self-reliance, these areas can quickly catch up with the current high-yield areas, and even surpass them and become new commodity bases for producing grain, cotton, oil, and pigs for the state. Of course, our emphasis on accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization does not mean that all trades and professions must supply agriculture with machines, but around the general goal of mechanization, combine their own work characteristics and provide necessary support. Similarly, our emphasis on grasping both ends refers to the leadership method, which does not mean slowing down the development speed of agricultural technical transformation in general areas, or treating the key areas of agricultural mechanization as the key areas for all trades and professions to support agriculture. On the contrary, it should be to create experience, set up models, and drive the general areas to keep up closely by grasping the key points at both ends, so as to accelerate the process of the entire agricultural technical transformation. Therefore, the key areas of various departments and trades and professions can also be selected in combination with their own business characteristics, so as to grasp the key points and improve comprehensively.
    According to the experience of previous years, the means of production required for each farming season are roughly adapted to the quantity and variety of supply; however, it is inevitable that there will be some cases of mismatch. Therefore, it is also a very important link in doing a good job in fully supporting agriculture for all localities to grasp the current production and supply and adapt to the urgent needs of rural areas. Supporting agriculture should be based on needs and possibilities, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and making comprehensive plans. The plan should specify specific tasks, specific indicators, and specific measures; in terms of quantity, quality, variety, specifications, and the required time, raw materials, and labor force, implement them one by one to the end, and then link one link to another, guarantee one level to another, organize shock attacks, and complete them within the time limit. Agricultural production has a strong seasonality, and the variety and quantity of means of production required by rural areas also change greatly with the change of seasons, and the time is also more urgent. Industrial departments must adapt to this characteristic, grasp the center in a period of time, organize shock attacks, and then grasp another center in the next period to organize shock attacks. In this way, one shock attack is followed by another shock attack, one upsurge is followed by another upsurge, and the movement itself becomes not only a shock mass movement but also a wave-like development of a regular mass movement. In this way, the development of the movement will be more in-depth and healthier. The mutual relationship between urban and rural areas, between industry and agriculture, and between leaders and the masses will be closer, and industrial and agricultural production will be more active. Therefore, it is very necessary for a province, a special region, or a county to hold a special meeting at the beginning of each quarter to study and deploy the production and supply of means of production to support agriculture in the next quarter, adapt to local conditions and seize the opportunity to grasp it early and well.
    A mass movement of industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas on an unprecedented scale has been vigorously launched throughout the country. This great mass is under the brilliant light of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, under the guidance of the fundamental policy of developing the entire national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, with the support of agriculture to accelerate technological transformation as the center, and is developing more and more comprehensively. In the process of the development of the movement, some successful experiences have been obtained in various places. Some time ago, this newspaper published the experience of the mechanical industry department of Hebei Province in running experimental fields in people's communes, which attracted attention from all aspects. Today, this newspaper publishes the situation in Jiangsu Province, where all trades and professions are supporting agriculture, forming a new upsurge, which fully reflects the spirit of combining the current and the long-term, combining needs and possibilities, and combining key points and general points, which is also worthy of attention. The current situation is extremely good, and the Party committees at all levels need to strengthen their leadership in a down-to-earth manner, adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, and fully mobilize the forces of all trades and professions and departments to push the mass movement of supporting the comprehensive and great development of agriculture to a new stage.

    各行各业都来支援农业
    我国农业生产在以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举的方针指导下，正以继续跃进的步伐向前迈进着。1960年将是我国农业生产继续全面大发展的一年。第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议批准的1960年国民经济计划规定，农业总产值要比去年增长12％；主要农产品中，粮食和棉花都要求比去年增长10％左右。同时，全国人民代表大会的这次会议还通过了1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要，并且号召提前两年或三年实现这个纲要。要实现这个伟大的任务，不仅要充分发挥人民公社的优越性，继续贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，要求农业、水利、林业、水产业等部门努力做好工作，也要求工业、交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等部门各行各业都把支援农业当做自己分内的重要任务，在全国掀起一个规模更大的各行各业全面支援农业的群众运动。
    各部门各行各业都来支援农业，这不仅是争取农业生产继续全面大发展的重要保证，对于争取整个国民经济更全面、更好地跃进，也有着十分重大的意义。我国社会主义建设的经验，特别是大跃进以来的经验已经一再证明：农业是国民经济的基础，在重工业优先发展的条件下，工农业生产同时高速度跃进，就能够有国民经济的全面的、高速度的跃进。我国是一个农业大国，农村既是工业发展的广阔市场，又是工业广阔的粮食和原料的基地。只有农业大发展，才可能向工业提出愈来愈大量的农业生产资料和生活资料的要求，也只有农业大发展才能促进重工业的大发展，才能为轻工业的大发展提供充足的原料。工业和农业的大发展，这就必然带来交通运输、商业以及科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等各方面事业的大繁荣。所以，支援农业不仅是为了增产更多的粮食、棉花和各种农副产品，也是为了多产钢铁，多造机器，多产棉布，多办学校……。这是关系到全国六亿五千万人的切身大事，是同国民经济各部门自身的发展密切相关的重要任务。
    城市各行各业无论在物质技术或科学文化等各个方面比农村先进。城市支援农业，概括地说来，就是以加速农业技术改造为中心，各行各业根据自己部门的特点，围绕农业全面大发展的需要，从各自不同的岗位有计划地从物质上、技术上和经验方面帮助农村各项事业首先是生产事业的发展和提高。工业部门要把支援农业的任务纳入自己的生产计划，要生产更多更好的农业机械、农具、化肥、农药等生产资料和日用消费品；主要产品一定要保证按量、按质、按时完成，以满足农业生产的需要；同时，要派遣工人和技术人员支援县、社工业，组织服务队传授技术经验，帮助公社培养技术干部；在可能的条件下，还要给予物质上的支援，帮助公社办好工厂。交通运输部门首先要做到根据农业生产和生活的需要，随要随运，不误农时；同时，还要积极帮助农村发展土铁路和各种民间运输工具。商业部门要适应农业需要，要主动帮助人民公社大办工业，就地取材，就地制造，就地供应，自力更生，解决部分农具的生产和修配；同时，积极做好供应工作，做到服务到社、到队、到田、到方，保证供应，及时收购，不耽误农民的生产时间。财政金融部门要积极组织并保证及早供给发展农业所需的资金，扩大生产投资，促进农业全面发展多种经营；同时还要帮助人民公社健全财务制度。科学、教育工作也要面向农业生产，根据农业生产的需要做科学研究工作，及时帮助农村解决生产上急需解决的科学技术问题，帮助农村发展群众性的农业科学研究工作，发展科学技术和教育事业。文化、卫生、体育部门，也要帮助农村开展群众性的文化娱乐活动，办好托儿所、公社医院等等事业，开展群众性的体育活动。现在，许多省、市、自治区已经开始普遍组织城乡挂钩、厂社挂钩，并从城市的工业部门发展到各行各业普遍同县社挂钩协作，按照公社的需要和厂矿等单位的可能，给予支援。城乡之间互相制订规划，签订支援合同，发挥了双方的积极性和主动性，形成了工农业生产共同跃进的社会主义竞赛热潮。事实证明，把工业支援农业、城市支援农村，发展成为一个全民性的群众运动，采取分别挂钩的形式，建立固定的协作联系，这不论在当前或长远来说，都是有着十分重要的意义的。城市工业、交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门分出一定的力量面向农村，分别与县社挂钩，是加速农业技术改造和农村社会主义建设的有力措施，也是加强工农联盟的新形式，应当大力提倡，普遍推行。
    在全面开展各部门各行各业支援农业的群众运动的基础上，又必须采取抓住两头、带动中间的做法，进行农业的技术改造。目前，支援的重点应当放在粮食产量商品率比较高的地区和农业生产困难比较大的地区，帮助他们尽快地实现农业机械化、半机械化，帮助他们全面发展，使低产地区赶上高产地区，使高产地区更上一层楼。在我国农村中全面地实现农业机械化，这是我们坚定不移的方针，而且为时也不会太远。但就当前来说，我们的工业虽然有了相当的基础，可是仍然不够发达，支援农业实现机械化、半机械化只能是有计划、有重点、有步骤地积极进行。农业劳动由主要是手工操作到全部实现机械化、半机械化操作，必须根据需要和可能相结合的原则，必须分清主次，抓住重点，带动一般，有计划、有步骤地、积极地进行。所谓重点，也是相对的，不是一成不变的，是要随着情况的发展变化而有所推移的。究竟哪一类地区应当成为当前促其加速实现农业机械化、半机械化的重点呢？这要从全国、全省来作通盘的考虑。一般说来，抓住高产地区和低产地区这两头，是比较适宜的。随着社会主义建设事业特别是现代化工业的发展，城市和工矿区的人口在不断增加，对农村提供商品粮食的需要量越来越大。在今后一定时期内向国家提供的大量的商品粮食，主要的还是要依靠原有的高产地区和新建立起来的商品粮食基地。这些地区仍然是以手工操作、畜力耕耘为主，劳动生产率不是很高的，增产的潜力还很大。这些高产地区要更大幅度的增产，除了要继续坚决地依靠群众，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”外，迫切需要在实现机械化、半机械化方面提前一步，把农业生产迅速转移到新的技术基础上来。这些地区广泛使用先进的农业机械以后，就可以解放出大批的农业劳动力，来积极发展林牧副渔以及社办工业，大兴多种经营，促进农业的全面大发展。同时，对于实现农业机械化、半机械化所需要的资金，高产地区一般都完全可以自行解决，这也是一个很重要的有利条件。再从当前农业生产上困难较多的低产地区来看，当地的人民群众是勤劳勇敢、干劲冲天的，对于迅速摆脱“一穷二白”的落后面貌有着十分强烈的愿望。他们几年来在党的领导下，农业生产也有了很大的提高。但是，由于历史原因以及自然条件的某些暂时的因素，在经济上存在的困难比较多一些，工业基础也比较薄弱，一般是地多人少，缺乏劳动力的情况比较突出，农业生产中存在着更大的潜力，有待于进一步的发掘。为了迅速彻底改变这些地区的落后面貌，使各类地区的经济发展，在新的水平上趋向平衡，或者缩短差距，除了主要依靠这些地区的广大人民群众顽强努力，艰苦奋斗以外，国家在可能的条件下给予必要的支援，城市和先进地区给予大力的支援，帮助他们加快实现农业机械化的步伐，是完全必要的。这些地区在自力更生的基础上只要略加援助，就可以迅速赶上现在的高产地区，甚至可以做到后来居上，成为国家新的生产粮棉油猪的商品基地。当然，我们强调加速实现农业机械化、半机械化，并不是意味着各行各业都要以机器供给农业，而是围绕着机械化这一总的目标，结合本身工作特点，给予必要的支援。同样的，我们强调抓住两头，这是指的领导方法，决不意味着放慢一般地区农业技术改造的发展速度，或者把农业机械化的重点地区当做各行各业支援农业的重点地区。相反地，应当是通过抓住两头作重点，创造经验，树立榜样，带动一般地区紧紧跟上，以加快整个农业技术改造的进程。因此，各部门、各行各业的重点地区也可以结合自己的业务特点来选择，做到抓住重点，全面提高。
    根据历年的经验，每个农时季节需要的生产资料与供应的数量品种，大体上是相适应的；但是，也难免有一些不相适应的情况。因此，各地抓紧当前的生产和供应，适应农村的迫切需要，也是作好全面支援农业十分重要的一环。支援农业应根据需要与可能，分别轻重缓急，作出全面规划。在规划中，规定具体任务、具体指标和具体措施；在数量、质量、品种、规格和所需要的时间、原材料、劳动力等方面，逐一落实到底，然后一环扣一环，一关保一关，组织突击，限期完成。农业生产有着强烈的季节性，随着季节的变化，农村所需的生产资料品种和数量的变化也比较大，而且时间也比较迫切。工业部门必须适应这个特点，在一个时期内抓住中心，组织突击，到下一个时期内又抓住另一个中心，组织突击。这样，一个突击紧接一个突击，一个高潮紧接一个高潮，运动的本身也就成为既是一个突击性的群众运动，又是一个波浪式发展的经常性的群众运动。这样，运动的发展就会更加深入、更加健康。城乡之间、工农业之间、领导和群众之间的相互关系就会更加亲密，工农业生产就更加主动。因此，一个省、一个专区、一个县，在每一个季度开始的时候，专门开一次会，研究布置下一个季度支援农业的生产资料的生产和供应工作，因地因时制宜，确定重点，力求抓早抓好，这是十分必要的。
    一个空前规模的工业支援农业、城市支援农村的群众运动，已经在全国各地蓬勃展开了。这个伟大的群众运动是在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，是在发展整个国民经济以农业为基础、以工业为主导、实行工农业并举的根本方针的指导下，以支援农业加速进行技术改造为中心，日益全面地发展起来的。在运动发展的过程中，各地已经取得了一些成功的经验。前些时候，本报曾刊登河北省的机械工业部门在人民公社大办试验田的经验，引起各方面的注意。今天本报发表的江苏省各行各业支援农业形成了新高潮的情况，充分地体现了当前和长远相结合、需要和可能相结合、重点和一般相结合的精神，也是值得注意的。当前形势极为良好，各级党委需要切实加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动各行各业各部门的力量，把支援农业全面大发展的群众运动推向一个崭新的阶段。
