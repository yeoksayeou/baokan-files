Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 2nd: The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, which opened on March 30th, successfully concluded on April 1st.

The plenary session passed a resolution on increasing agricultural production and developing agricultural production cooperatives. In addition, it also adopted the report by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "The Socialist Countries Struggle for Abundant Agricultural Products, and the German Democratic Republic Struggles to Improve the Commodity Production of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," as well as the report by Central Political Bureau member, Matern.

This Central Plenary Session was held after a long period of mass discussion and deliberation. Before the plenary session, the Socialist Unity Party published a draft resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session, launching extensive discussions. Members and alternate members of the Party Central Political Bureau went to rural areas to talk with cadres and farmers, studying the current new situation and problems in the countryside. The Party Central Committee's Agricultural Committee also held a special meeting to study the development of socialist collective labor in rural areas. At the time of the plenary session, 469 Party and non-Party agricultural experts, chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, and livestock breeders were invited to participate. Speakers at the meeting reported on their recent work experience from various aspects.

Central Political Bureau member and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Leuschner, pointed out in his speech at the plenary session that all potential in industry should now be mobilized to support agriculture. The entire national economy should use its greatest efforts to promote the development of agriculture on the basis of modernized, socialist large-scale production. He said that it is necessary to make some changes in the national economic plan that are conducive to agricultural development.

Alternate member of the Central Political Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, Grüneberg, made a concluding speech at the plenary session. He pointed out that the urgent task in agriculture at present is: we must pay full attention to the growth of livestock numbers and the quantity of livestock products, so as to ensure that domestic livestock products can meet the growing needs of residents by 1963. He said that launching a broad movement among residents to increase production and overfulfill targets, expanding feed production, and establishing a feed reserve of at least four months are the most important conditions for improving livestock product production. Grüneberg pointed out that the new situation in agriculture requires improving the level of government leadership, strengthening ties between state organs and cooperative farmers, and encouraging women and youth to participate in agricultural production.

    德国统一社会党八中全会通过决议
    增加农业生产和发展农业合作社
    乌布利希号召为提高农业生产合作社的商品生产而奋斗
    洛伊施纳指出全部国民经济应尽最大努力促进农业发展
    新华社柏林2日电　3月30日开幕的德国统一社会党中央委员会第八次全体会议已经在4月1日胜利闭幕。
    全会通过了关于增加农业生产和发展农业生产合作社的决议。此外，还通过了德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希所作的题为“社会主义各国为生产丰裕的农产品而奋斗和德意志民主共和国为提高农业生产合作社的商品生产而奋斗”的报告，以及中央政治局委员马特恩的报告。
    这次中央全会是经过长期的群众性的讨论和酝酿后举行的。全会召开前，统一社会党公布了八中全会决议草案，发动大家广泛讨论，党中央政治局委员和候补委员们曾分别到农村中同干部、农民谈话，研究当前农村的新形势和问题。党中央农业委员会也举行了专门会议，研究在农村中发展社会主义集体劳动的问题。在全会召开的时候，又邀请了四百六十九位党的和非党的农业专家、农业生产合作社主席、牲畜饲养员等参加。会议上，发言者从各方面报告他们最近一个时期的工作经验。
    中央政治局委员、国家计划委员会主席洛伊施纳在全会上的发言中指出：工业中的全部潜力现在应该动员起来支持农业。全部国民经济应该用最大的努力，以促进在现代化的社会主义的大规模生产的基础上的农业的发展。他说，在国民经济计划中，作一些有利于农业发展的更改是必要的。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员、中央书记处书记格吕纳贝格在全会上作了总结发言。他指出，当前在农业中的迫切任务是：必须充分注意牲畜头数和畜产品数量的增长，以便做到在1963年国内畜产品能满足居民日益增长的需要。他说，在居民中展开一个增加生产和超额完成指标的广泛的运动，扩大饲料生产、建立至少四个月的饲料储备，是提高畜产品生产的最重要条件。格吕纳贝格指出，农业中新情况要求提高政府领导工作水平，密切国家机关和合作农民的关系，鼓励妇女和青年参加农业生产。
