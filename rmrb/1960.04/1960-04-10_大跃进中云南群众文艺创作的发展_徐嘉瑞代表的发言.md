Presidium, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960, and the work report of the Standing Committee.

I am a literary and art worker. Now, I will report to the conference on the great achievements made in Yunnan's literary and art work under the leadership of the Party in the past ten years since liberation, especially the development of mass creation in Yunnan during the Great Leap Forward, and ask for your guidance.

In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the province's literary and artistic work has resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth the new through the old, and has achieved great success.

The leadership of the Party is the decisive factor; the change of production relations and the liberation of productive forces are the foundation for the emergence of a literary and artistic upsurge. The mass cultural revolution movement and mass creation are the huge forces that promote the development of literature and art.

New folk songs are new products of mass creation, new "Guo Feng" of the socialist era

After the arrival of the economic upsurge, the cultural upsurge and the mass creation upsurge followed. The first wave was new folk songs. New folk songs are new products created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward under the advocacy of Chairman Mao; they are the splendid flowers opened after the working people mastered the weapon of culture; the working people are the creators of material wealth and spiritual wealth, but before liberation, they were always oppressed and ravaged. Yunnan is a province with many ethnic groups, and the reactionary ruling class discriminated against the cultures of the fraternal ethnic groups even more. After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and literary and artistic policies, the working people of all ethnic groups became masters of their own affairs and not only mastered the means of production but also the weapon of culture. When the weapon of culture returned to the hands of the working people, it exerted an incomparably powerful force. Production relations have changed, productive forces have been liberated, and productive forces in literary and artistic creation have also been liberated. During the Great Leap Forward, the working people of all ethnic groups, in their unique forms and styles, bloomed like splendid sparks in a steelmaking furnace, forming a prosperous scene of a hundred flowers blooming in a riot of colors. During the Great Leap Forward, under the advocacy of Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan created millions of new folk songs. Not only is the quantity astonishing, but the quality and content are also incomparable to the folk songs of the old era. It is the new "Guo Feng" of the socialist era, the new ideology and new style under the new system, the national form, the socialist content, and some already have the seeds of communism. The Provincial Party Committee issued instructions to collect them immediately, and each special county printed more than 100 volumes of folk song selections. The province also published two collections, some of which have been selected into "Red Flag Ballads." Never before have the people been seen to be so high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. From the ocean-like folk songs, it is expressed the hundredfold confidence in building socialism under the leadership of the Party, the pursuit of the even greater goal of communism, and the great ambition to transform nature. This is unprecedented in Chinese literary history. For example, the poem by the electricians of the Yihe River Hydropower Station:

	The mountains are higher than the clouds, and the utility poles are higher than the sky;
	We climb up the utility poles and reach out to pick the stars;
	Catch the moon and the sun, and together with the earth,
	String them together with wires and let them serve humanity.

Naxi folk song of Lijiang:

	Red flowers bloom on Jade Dragon Mountain, a group of red girls among the flowers,
	Picking up a hoe is a farmer, picking up an iron hook is a worker,
	The moon is round on the fifteenth, and the sisters are reunited today,
	Meet as workers, making steel on Jade Dragon Mountain,
	The old man is fifty-six this year, building a steel furnace on Jade Dragon Mountain,
	His children and grandchildren don't worry about him, making steel to create happiness for him.

Folk songs show that the Great Leap Forward has changed the face of nature and changed people's ideology. For example, the folk song of Yongguang Commune in Kaiyuan:

	Late rice seedlings are green, early rice is yellow, harvesting rice and transplanting seedlings are busy at both ends,
	Harvesting early rice at dawn, transplanting late rice under the colorful clouds,
	Harvesting and transplanting at the same time is rare in Yunnan.

Bai folk song of Dali:

	The General Line has spread to the countryside, rejoicing and cheering.
	Cangshan leaps and Erhai smiles, people change their minds and the land is refitted.

New folk songs reflect the working class's selfless labor and bold creation. In the steelmaking process, people's ideology was also refined, and the face of nature was changed. "People change their minds and the land is refitted" is a beautiful sentence in Bai folk songs. New folk songs reflect the great changes of Chinese women. Women who used to be called "pot-stirrers" have become red girls who are both farmers and workers during the Great Leap Forward. "Picking up a hoe is a farmer, picking up an iron hook is a worker" is a beautiful sentence in Naxi folk songs. In the Miao ethnic group, the first generation of female steelworkers appeared, smelting the first furnace of steel for the Miao ethnic group in Jinping County. These new heroic figures and heroic deeds, reflected in the excellent verses in folk songs, are countless. New folk songs sing the praises of the great Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune with innocent language and sincere feelings. It is the voice of the socialist revolution era in our country. It is a new ode of the era of the proletariat creating the world, a magnificent poem reflecting the great era, a product of the great leap forward in production, which in turn promotes the leap forward in production. These new folk songs shattered the fallacies of those who belittle the working people and mass creation. Mass creation develops in constant struggle.

Factory histories and commune histories were produced along with the development of new folk songs

Along with the development of new folk songs, factory histories and commune histories were also produced. Factory histories and commune histories are products of the mass creation movement. The workers have become the masters of the country and need to write their own history. The workers recalled the past, saw the future, summarized the present experience, and guided the future leap forward. Tens of thousands of old and new workers wrote hundreds of thousands of memoirs, folk songs, murals, etc. A brand-new factory history was written under the combination of the masses and professionals. In the countryside, the rising sun rose on the eastern horizon. The commune members also needed to write their own history. In Yunnan, a mass creation movement of factory histories, mine histories, commune histories, railway histories, pasture histories, tea garden histories, etc., was vigorously launched. These histories were created under the combination of the broad masses and professionals. "Selected Yunnan Factory Histories" and "Selected Yunnan People's Commune Histories," focusing on Kunming, Gejiu, and Dongchuan, are about to be published. At the same time, many amateur authors among veteran cadres have written many revolutionary memoirs, and exciting outstanding works have appeared, such as the "Memoirs of the War of Resistance Against Japan" and "Fragments of Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Diaries" written by veteran cadres in our province, which have been welcomed by readers. The emergence of these factory histories and memoirs has given a new look to the literary journal "Borderland Literature" in our province.

The excavation, collection, and sorting of national folk literature is another aspect of the mass creation movement

Another aspect of the Yunnan mass creation movement is the work of excavation, collection, and sorting of national folk literature. The literature of Yunnan's fraternal ethnic groups is very rich and beautiful, and the styles and forms are also diverse. Before liberation, some people collected and sorted them, but it was only handicraft-like production, divorced from the masses, and the amount of excavation was even smaller. Before the counterattack against the rightists, a group of rightists with the purpose of "seeking novelty" and "profiting," such as Gong Liu and Zhou Liangpei, regarded the collection of national literature as a "golden rice bowl," arbitrarily tampered with it, in order to achieve personal fame and gain. In the anti-rightist struggle, the thoughts and styles of the rightists were thoroughly criticized. In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, a group of investigation teams was organized, including some teachers and students from the Chinese Departments of Yunnan University and Normal College, and cadres from literary and artistic organizations, more than 100 people, went to ethnic minority areas to collect. Because they insisted on relying on the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, firmly relied on the masses, and ate, lived, and worked with the masses, helped farmers with production, learning, and even writing letters and mending clothes, they gained the trust of the masses, and the masses regarded the investigation team as people sent by Chairman Mao to collect national literature. The elderly ran from hundreds of miles away to find the investigation team to offer treasures, and the young came to find the investigation team to sing and say. The Party committees at all levels strongly supported it. When they set off from Kunming, there were only more than 100 people. When they arrived at the special area, the cadres and translators doubled it, and when they arrived at the county and township, it doubled again, forming a mass movement of mass collection and mass excavation. Therefore, in a short period of three or four months, hundreds of thousands of works and dozens of long poems have been collected. After liberation, under the attention of the Party, relying on the Party committees at all levels, following the mass line, the long poems "Ashima" and "Escape to a Sweet Place" of the Sani ethnic group, the Miao long poem "Hongzhao and Rao Jue Xina," the Dai "Songpa Min and Jia Xina," the Lisu "Escape Marriage Tune," "Production Tune," and "Jade Dragon Third Country" (Naxi) and "Wangfu Cloud" (Bai), which were created based on the original legends, have been excavated and sorted out. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Dai long poems "Ebing and Sangluo" and "Gourd Letter," the Yi epic "Meige," "Axi's First Chicken," and the Naxi epic "Genesis" were sorted out as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the National Day. After publication, they received attention from all parties.

Yunnan mass literary and artistic creation, as manifested in the writing of "Ethnic Literary History," is also a prominent example. The mass collection and excavation in 1958 created the best conditions for writing the literary history of various ethnic groups. In a short period of time, seven ethnic groups and nine literary histories were written (including two for the Dai and two for the Yi), each with about 100,000 to 350,000 words. "Bai Literary History" and "Naxi Literary History" have been sorted out as gifts for the National Day, and after publication, they have also received attention from all parties. This is something that experts could not have dreamed of or done before liberation. These achievements have been achieved under the specific guidance and help of Party committees at all levels and with the support of the broad masses. Because the masses cared, all positive factors in writing literary history were mobilized, political leadership was adhered to, the writing method guided by Mao Zedong Thought was adhered to, and the method of combining the masses and experts was implemented, so that such work could be completed in the shortest time.

In the past Chinese literary history, there was no place for the literature of fraternal ethnic groups. Fraternal ethnic groups have their own literary history, which is only possible under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The literary histories of various ethnic groups are still being sorted out. Its appearance is a concentrated expression of mass power. Undoubtedly, it will push mass creation of various ethnic groups to a new stage.

In inheriting the national literary heritage, we follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "We must distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of ancient times, that is, things that are somewhat democratic and revolutionary." Following this instruction, the heritage is critically accepted. The purpose of inheritance is not to follow the old and keep the old, but to innovate and create. On the one hand, inherit the tradition, on the other hand, break the tradition. To "bring forth the new," we must "weed through the old." "Bringing forth the new" is the purpose of "weeding through the old"; "weeding through the old" is the foundation of "bringing forth the new." In the past ten years, fraternal ethnic groups have been constantly educated and cultivated by the Party, and have been influenced by the advanced culture of the Han nationality, especially the socialist revolutionary culture, and have innovated and developed their own national traditions. This is an important factor for the continuous growth of new singers, poets, and writers in various ethnic groups.

Many poets have emerged in various ethnic groups, creating poems reflecting the reality of struggle

In various ethnic groups, many poets have emerged, and the creation of poems reflecting the reality of struggle is inseparable from the influence of mass creation. For example, Kang Langshuai of the Dai ethnic group, carrying his luggage, worked and sang with the masses at the reservoir construction site, and was welcomed and encouraged by the masses. Influenced by the heroic spirit of thousands of troops and horses, he created many excellent poems and created "Song of the Dai People." Kang Langying's "Song of the Liusha River" was also produced under the upsurge of mass creation. The singers of the Bai, Naxi, Yi, and Miao ethnic groups are also like this. Comrades Kang Langshuai, Kang Langying, and Bo Yuwen are also prominent examples in inheriting tradition, innovating, and creating. They use national forms to sing the praises of socialism, and in their creation, they have pushed the national form and style to a new stage.

Yunnan's professional writers, such as Comrade Liu Shude, have written "Bridge" and "Old Cow Tendon," etc. Yi writer Comrade Li Qiao wrote "The Laughing Jinsha River," peasant writer Comrade Li Maorong wrote "People Look to the Happiness Tree and the Tree Looks to Spring," Guo Guofu's "In the Angmeina Tribe," and the short stories by Yi peasant writer Pu Fei, Bai Yang Su, and worker writer Wang Yunfei (automobile driver), etc., have all been welcomed by readers. They grew up under the education and cultivation of the Party, and they also grew up by participating in labor in the masses and in the communes for a long time. Comrade Li Maorong began to learn to write clappers in 1952, and now he can write excellent full-length works. This was unimaginable before liberation. He has been participating in labor and struggle in the countryside for a long time, which is a prominent example of the intellectualization of the working people under the education of the Party. The mass literary and artistic creation also gave them great encouragement. In the film script, "Five Golden Flowers" was welcomed by the broad masses and played a great role in encouraging production enthusiasm. This is a product of the Great Leap Forward with more, faster, better, and more economical results. It is a product of the combination of professional and mass under the specific leadership of Party committees at all levels. As for the Yunnan "Beijing Opera," "Dian Opera," and "Flower Lantern," which have been performed in Beijing one after another, they have all received extremely high praise. Without exception, these types of dramas have grown up under the education and cultivation of the Party and have been continuously strengthened with the support and love of the broad masses. Many new types of dramas have also been discovered in various ethnic groups, such as the Bai ethnic group's large folk song drama, the "Chuichuiqiang" drama, the "Dai Opera," "Yi Opera," and "Zhuang Opera," etc., which are new types of dramas produced during the Great Leap Forward in production and the mass literary and artistic creation movement. The Yunnan folk songs sung by Comrade Huang Hong, which are welcomed by the broad audience, are all excellent folk songs of mass creation.

The power of the masses is very strong, and the wisdom of the masses is endless. Under the leadership of the Party, it can exert incomparably powerful force. This is true in production struggles, and it is also true in mass literary and artistic creation. These victories are the victory of the General Line, the victory of the Party's literary and artistic policy, and the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. At the recently held Second Yunnan Provincial Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in Yunnan unanimously expressed that they would launch an upsurge of studying Mao Zedong's works, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, strengthen ideological transformation, challenge and respond to each other at the conference, and create better works as gifts to the 40th anniversary of the great Party.

    大跃进中云南群众文艺创作的发展
    徐嘉瑞代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和常务委员会的工作报告。
    我是一个文艺工作者。我现在把解放十年来云南文艺工作在党的领导下所取得的巨大成绩，尤其是大跃进中的云南群众创作的发展，向大会汇报，请予指教。
    十年来，我省的文学艺术工作，在省委的领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党中央和毛主席的文艺为无产阶级政治服务，文艺为工农兵服务的方向，和百花齐放，百家争鸣，推陈出新的方针，取得了很大的成绩。
    党的领导，是决定的因素；生产关系的改变和生产力的解放，是文艺高潮出现的基础。群众性的文化革命运动和群众性创作，是鼓动文艺发展的巨大力量。
    新民歌是群众创作的新产物，是社会主义时代的新国风
    在经济高潮到来之后，文化高潮和群众创作高潮就跟着到来。第一个浪头，就是新民歌。新民歌是在毛主席倡导下，在大跃进中，群众创作的新的产物；是劳动人民掌握文化武器后，所开放出来的烂灿的花朵；劳动人民是物质财富的创造者，也是精神财富的创造者，但在解放前，永远是被压迫的、被摧残的。云南，是多民族的省份，反动统治阶级对兄弟民族的文化，更加歧视。到解放后，在党中央和毛主席的民族政策、文艺政策光辉照耀之下，各族劳动人民当家作主，不但掌握了生产资料，还掌握了文化武器。当文化武器回到劳动人民手中，就发挥出无比强大的力量。生产关系改变了，生产力解放了，文艺创作上的生产力也解放了。各族劳动人民以各族特有的形式，特具的风格，在大跃进中，像炼钢炉中的火花一样，开出绚烂的花来，形成万紫千红百花齐放的繁荣景象。在大跃进中，在毛主席的倡导下，云南各族人民，创作出数以百万计的新民歌来，不只数量惊人，而在质量和内容方面，也是旧时代的民歌所不能比拟的。它是社会主义时代的新国风，是新制度下的新思想、新风格，是民族的形式，社会主义的内容，有的已具有共产主义的萌芽。省委发出即时收集的指示，各专县印出了一百多本民歌选，省里也出版了两集，其中一部分优秀的，已被选入“红旗歌谣”。从来没有见过人民群众像现在这样的意气风发斗志昂扬。从海洋似的民歌中，表现出在党领导下建设社会主义的百倍信心，表现出对更远大的目标——共产主义的追求，表现出排山倒海改造自然的壮志雄心。这是中国文学史中所绝无的事。如以礼河水电站电线工人的诗：
    山比云高，电线杆比天高；
    我们爬上电杆，伸手把星星摘到；
    捉住月亮还有太阳，和地球一道，
    用电线穿起来，叫它为人类效劳。
    丽江纳西族民歌：
    玉龙山上红花开，花中一群红姑娘，
    拿起锄头是农民，拿起铁钩是工人，
    月亮团圆在十五，姊妹团圆在今天，
    做个工人来相见，玉龙山上大炼钢，
    老汉今年五十六，玉龙山上建钢炉，
    家中子孙不挂他，炼钢为他造幸福。
    民歌表现出大跃进改变了自然面貌，改变了人们的思想意识。如开远永光社民歌：
    晚稻苗青早稻黄，打谷?秧两头忙，
    迎着黎明收早稻，顶着彩霞?晚秧，
    一面收获一面?秧，在云南是很少见的事情。
    大理白族民歌：
    总路线，传到乡，欢欣鼓舞喜洋洋。
    苍山飞跃洱海笑，人改思想地改装。
    新民歌反映工人阶级忘我的劳动，大胆的创造，在大炼钢中，同时也炼了人的思想意识，改变了自然的面貌。“人改思想地改装”是白族民歌中的佳句。新民歌反映了中国妇女的巨大变化。过去被称为“锅边转”的妇女，在大跃进中，已经变成了既是农民又是工人的红色姑娘。“拿起锄头是农民，拿起铁钩是工人”，是纳西族民歌中的佳句。在苗族妇女中出现了第一代女炼钢工人，炼出了金屏县苗族的第一炉钢。这一些新英雄人物英雄事迹，反映在民歌中的优秀诗句，是难以计数的。新民歌以天真的语言，真挚的感情，歌颂伟大的党，伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂总路线，歌颂大跃进，歌颂人民公社，是我国社会主义革命时代的声音。是无产阶级创造世界时代的新颂歌，是反映伟大时代的壮丽宏伟的诗篇，是生产大跃进中的产物，转而推动生产跃进。这一些新民歌粉碎了那一些轻视劳动人民，轻视群众创作的谬论。群众创作，是在不断斗争中发展的。
    工厂史、公社史随着新民歌的发展而产生了
    随着新民歌的发展，工厂史、公社史也产生了。工厂史、公社史更是广大群众创作运动中的产物。工人作了国家的主人，需要写自己的历史。工人们回忆过去，看见未来，总结现在的经验，指导未来的跃进，成千上万的老工人新工人，写出了数十万张的回忆录、民歌、壁画等。在群众与专业结合之下写出了崭新的工厂史。在农村中，初生的太阳在东方的地平线上升了起来。社员们也需要写自己的历史。在云南掀起了工厂史、矿山史、公社史、铁路史、牧场史、茶园史等的群众创作运动，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。这一些历史是在广大的群众与专业相结合之下，创作出来的。以昆明、个旧、东川为重点的“云南工厂史选”和“云南各族人民公社史选”即将出版。同时许多老干部中的业余作者，曾写出许多革命回忆录，出现了激动人心的优秀作品，如我省老干部所写的“抗日战争回忆录”“抗美援朝日记片断”等，都受到读者的欢迎。这一些工厂史、回忆录的出现，使我省文艺刊物“边疆文艺”面目为之一新。
    民族民间文学的发掘、收集和整理是群众创作运动的另一方面
    云南群众创作运动，表现在另一方面的是，民族民间文学发掘、收集和整理的工作。云南兄弟民族文学是很丰富的、美丽的，风格形式，也是多种多样的。解放以前，就有人收集整理，但是只是手工业似的生产，脱离群众，发掘量更少，在反击右派以前，又出现了一批以“猎奇”“获利”为目的的右派分子，如公刘、周良沛等，把收集民族文学当做“金饭碗”，任意篡改，以达到个人名利为目的。反右斗争中，彻底批判了右派的思想作风。1958年，在党领导下，组织了一批调查队，包括云南大学及师范学院中文系一部分师生，和文艺机关的干部，一百多人到各民族地区进行收集，由于坚持了依靠各级党委的领导，坚决依靠群众，和群众同吃同住同劳动，帮助农民生产，学习，以至于写信，补衣，取得群众的信任，群众把调查队当做毛主席派来收集民族文学的人。年老的从百里外跑来找调查队献宝，年轻的来找调查队说唱。各级党委大力支援，在昆明出发只百多人，到专区又派干部和翻译已加一倍，到县到乡又加一倍，形成了群众收集群众发掘的运动。因此在短短的三、四月期间，已收集了几十万件作品，和几十部长诗。解放后，在党的重视下，依靠各级党委，走群众路线已发掘和整理出撒尼族的长诗“阿诗玛”和“逃到甜蜜的地方”，苗族长诗“红昭与饶觉席那”，傣族的“松帕敏与戛西娜”，傈僳族的“逃婚调”、“生产调”和根据原传说创作的“玉龙第三国”（纳西族）、“望夫云”（白族）等。1958年大跃进中又整理出傣族长诗“娥并与桑洛”、“葫芦信”，彝族史诗“梅葛”、“阿细的先鸡”和纳西族史诗“创世纪”等，作为国庆十周年献礼，出版后，受到各方面的重视。
    云南群众文艺创作，表现在“民族文学史”的编写上也是一个突出的例子。1958年的群众性的收集发掘，为写各民族文学史，创造了最好的条件。在短短的时期中，写出了七个民族九种文学史（其中傣族二种，彝族二种），每一种都在十万言到三十五万言左右，已经整理出“白族文学史”和“纳西族文学史”作为国庆献礼，出版后，也受到了各方面的重视。这是解放以前专家们所不能梦想和做到的事。这一些成绩，是在各级党委具体指导帮助下所取得的，是在广大群众的支持下所取得的。由于群众关心，调动了在编写文学史方面的一切积极因素，坚持政治挂帅，坚持用毛泽东思想为指导的编写方法，也贯彻了群众与专家相结合的方法，才能在最短期间完成这样的工作。
    过去的中国文学史中，是没有兄弟民族文学的位置的。兄弟民族有自己的文学史，只有在党中央和毛主席的领导下，才有可能。各民族文学史还在整理中。它的出现，是群众力量的集中表现。无疑的会把各民族群众创作，推向更新的阶段。
    在继承民族文学遗产方面，我们是遵循毛主席的指示：“必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西，和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”遵循这一指示，对遗产加以批判的接受，继承的目的不是为了因袭守旧，而是为了革新创造。一方面继承传统，一方面要打破传统。要“出新”必须“推陈”，“出新”是“推陈”的目的；“推陈”是“出新”的基础。十年来兄弟民族受到党不断的教育培养，受到汉民族先进文化尤其是社会主义革命文化的影响，对本民族传统，有了革新和发展。这是各民族中不断生长出新的歌手、诗人、作家的重要因素。
    各民族中涌现出不少诗人，创作出反映现实斗争的诗篇
    在各民族中，涌现出不少的诗人，创作出反映现实斗争的诗篇是和群众的创作的影响分不开的。如傣族的康朗甩，背着行李在水库工地和群众一起劳动，一起歌唱，受到群众的欢迎鼓舞，受到千军万马排山倒海的英雄气魄的影响，创作出许多优秀的诗，创作出“傣家人之歌”。康朗英的“流沙河之歌”也是在群众创作高潮下产生的。白族、纳西族、彝族、苗族的歌手也是如此。康朗甩、康朗英、波玉温等同志在继承传统、革新创造方面，也是突出的例子。他们用民族形式，歌颂社会主义，在创作中，把民族形式风格，推向了一个新的阶段。
    云南的专业作家如刘树德同志写出了“桥”和“老牛筋”等。彝族作家李乔同志写出了“欢笑的金沙江”，农民作家李茂荣同志写出了“人望幸福树望春”，郭国甫同志的“在昂美纳部落里”以及和彝族农民作家普飞同志和白族杨苏同志，工人作家王云飞（汽车驾驶员）同志等的短篇小说，都受到读者的欢迎。他们是在党的教育培养下成长的，也是在群众中在公社中长期参加劳动壮大成长的。李茂荣同志，在1952年，开始学写快板，现在能写出优秀的长篇。在解放前这是不能想像的。他长期在农村参加劳动，参加斗争，这是在党的教育下，劳动人民知识化的一个突出的例子。而群众性的文艺创作，也给他们以很大的鼓舞。在电影剧本中“五朵金花”受到广大群众的欢迎，对生产热情鼓舞，起了很大的作用。这是大跃进中多快好省的产物，是在各级党委具体领导下专业与群众结合的产物。至于云南“京剧”“滇戏”“花灯”先后到北京上演，都获得了极大的好评。这一些剧种，无例外的是在党的教育培养下成长，在广大群众的支持爱护下，不断壮大的。各民族当中也发现了许多新的剧种，如白族的大本曲剧，“吹吹腔”剧，“傣戏”“彝戏”“僮戏”等，都是在生产大跃进中，在群众文艺创作运动中，所产生的新的剧种。还有黄虹同志所唱的云南民歌，受到广大听众的欢迎，都是群众创作的优秀民歌。
    群众的力量是非常强大的，群众的智慧，是无穷无尽的，在党的领导下，才能够发挥出无比强大的力量，在生产斗争中是如此，在群众文艺创作上也是如此。这些胜利，是总路线的胜利，是党的文艺政策的胜利，是毛泽东文艺思想辉煌的胜利。云南各民族的文艺工作者，在最近召开的云南省第二次文学艺术工作者代表大会上，一致表示要掀起学习毛泽东著作的高潮，更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，加强思想改造，在大会上互相挑战应战，要创作出更好的作品，向伟大的党的四十周年献礼。
