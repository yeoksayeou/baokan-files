Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th. Shandong Province has mobilized the masses to produce large quantities of wet-milled slag concrete (also known as activated slag concrete). Departments such as steel plants, cement plants, and construction sites have built 278 wet-milled slag concrete prefabrication plants that have been put into production. In the past half-month, more than 7,200 tons of wet-milled slag concrete have been produced, and more than 30 kinds of components have been manufactured, such as pit wood supports, sleepers, large panels, roof beams, hollow columns, telephone poles, and underground pipelines.

Wet-milled slag concrete is a new type of building material made by adding activators such as lime, gypsum, and calcium chloride to the slag flowing out of blast furnaces, and then crushing and mixing it through wet milling. It is of good quality, high performance, and low cost. It is especially suitable for large-scale load-bearing thin-walled high-efficiency concrete structures and the requirements of modern reinforced concrete component rolling processes. Therefore, in addition to being used extensively in industrial and civil buildings, it can also be used as a substitute for pit wood, sleepers, and telephone poles, as well as for paving roads and building dams and flues, with extremely wide applications.

Since the Great Leap Forward, although Shandong Province's cement production has greatly increased, it still cannot meet the needs of the high-speed development of capital construction. In order to solve this problem, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in mid-March to extensively mobilize the masses to use the large amount of waste slag from steel plants to manufacture wet-milled slag concrete, and called on all walks of life to quickly launch a mass movement to produce and use wet-milled slag concrete, striving for a "cement great leap forward" in March and April. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, all regions and departments have personally taken command by leading cadres, universally established offices, and implemented the policy of "walking on two legs" based on specific conditions: using indigenous methods where possible, and using modern methods when indigenous methods are not possible, vigorously carrying out the mass movement to produce wet-milled slag concrete. Units with good equipment and strong technical forces should make full use of existing equipment to rapidly mechanize or semi-mechanize the production of wet-milled slag concrete. For example, Jinan Iron and Steel Plant made full use of its original equipment to achieve full mechanization and semi-mechanization of the five processes of wet-milled slag concrete prefabrication: feeding, milling, forming, and curing. At present, this plant has produced a batch of high-grade prestressed wet-milled slag concrete water pipes, truss beams, large roof panels and other important building components. Units with poor equipment and technical strength, on the other hand, rely on their own efforts, making do with whatever is available, fully mobilizing the masses, and overcoming difficulties in every possible way to carry out production. For example, the construction, water conservancy, and transportation units in Zibo City lacked rolling equipment, so they went to ceramic factories and suburban people's communes to purchase or borrow their earth rollers and stone rollers, slightly modified them, and equipped them with gears for production. In Weifang City, without machine rollers, the masses were mobilized to use earth rollers, grindstones, stone mortars, and hand hammers; without boilers and steel pipes as curing equipment, iron pots were used instead of boilers, and bamboo pipes were used instead of steel pipes, and 145 prefabricated component curing pools were built to solve the difficulty of insufficient curing equipment. At present, they have not only fully utilized the water-quenched slag, but also crushed the non-water-quenched slag, using large pieces as aggregate for concrete skeletons, and fine particles as mortar for concrete, thus making full use of all accumulated slag.

In this movement, many units supported each other and carried out communist cooperation on a large scale. Under the unified leadership of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee, unified planning and designated production and sales points were implemented, and the method of one factory holding events and several factories providing support was adopted, so that some units with poor equipment and technical strength could also produce quickly. When Jinan Construction Company was building a factory, it could not be put into production for a long time due to incomplete equipment. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, it received support from fraternal units such as Jinan Cement Plant and Metal Processing Plant, and quickly built a fully mechanized wet-milled slag concrete prefabrication plant with a daily output of about 40 tons. On the first day after its completion, this factory produced ten cubic meters of prefabricated components.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, a new building material made from slag flowing out of blast furnaces as raw material - wet-milled slag concrete - has been widely used in various capital construction sites in Baotou Steel. This year, 130,000 cubic meters of concrete structures in Baotou Steel's No. 1 large open-hearth furnace, No. 2 blast furnace, coking, and mineral processing and sintering systems will all use this concrete. This will greatly save cement consumption.

The large amount of slag produced in metallurgical enterprises was previously treated as waste. Making wet-milled slag concrete with the same performance as ordinary cement concrete from this slag and widely using it in construction projects is an active and revolutionary measure taken by Baotou Steel builders to broaden the source of materials and strive to build Baotou Steel at a high speed. At the end of last year, Baotou Steel workers referred to the experience of comprehensive utilization of slag in various places and decided to start from manufacturing wet-milled slag concrete and make a big splash in the concrete technology revolution. Originally, blast furnace slag contains a large number of chemical components that are the same as cement. After water quenching the slag, and then mixing a certain proportion of gypsum, lime and a small amount of cement as an activator, and then wet milling, to stimulate the potential chemical gelling properties in the slag, the slag can be turned into a concrete gelling material that is the same as ordinary cement. The workers put forward ambitious slogans such as "Where there is a blast furnace, there is cement" and "Do not completely rely on the cement supplied by the state, let wet-milled slag concrete occupy the position of concrete engineering." The employees of the production enterprise company, who were responsible for the production of prefabricated components, took the lead in this technical revolution. They only spent 15 days to build a water slag plant for water quenching slag. Immediately afterwards, the employees of the Fourth Engineering Company built a wet-milled slag concrete manufacturing workshop with an annual output of 40,000 cubic meters while experimenting, producing, and building the factory, spending less than 50,000 yuan and 20 days. Other units also used indigenous methods to build equipment themselves. In less than two months, all construction and installation units in the company installed 95 sets of equipment for producing wet-milled slag concrete, building factories while producing more than 21,000 cubic meters of wet-milled slag concrete and applying it to projects. Many construction units completed the construction plan ahead of schedule when the cement supply was insufficient, and some engineering companies completed the construction task in the first quarter at the end of February.

Before using this new type of concrete in large quantities, Baotou Steel workers conducted scientific experiments many times in succession. Experiments have proved that the performance of wet-milled slag concrete is not inferior to that of ordinary concrete, and the main raw material, slag, is inexhaustible and inexpensive, and the cost is about 30% lower than that of cement. In terms of strength, since wet-milled slag concrete has the characteristics of high later strength, as long as the curing temperature is increased, the design strength can be quickly reached. When the production enterprise company was building a prestressed pipe factory building, it used wet-milled slag concrete for everything from the foundation, pillars, truss beams, to the crane beams supporting the 15-ton cranes. The factory building has been in good condition since it was put into production.

Now, Baotou Steel workers not only use wet-milled slag concrete for important engineering parts such as the foundations of various large industrial plants, trusses, large roof panels, and large prefabricated components, but also successfully trial-produced hot-cast slag pipes to replace the past cast iron pipes as drain pipes; Trial-produced high-grade thermal insulation slag cotton to replace the asbestos boards and other thermal insulation materials that are consumed in large quantities by metallurgical enterprises and are difficult to obtain. According to the characteristics of wet-milled slag concrete's dense organization, and after improvement, waterproof concrete was also made. The employees of the production enterprise company also used slag to produce a large number of hot-cast slag blocks to replace cement for paving road surfaces.

    山东、包钢开辟利用“废品”节省水泥的新途径
    大造湿碾矿渣混凝土
    本报济南7日电　山东省发动群众大量生产湿碾矿渣混凝土（又称活化矿渣混凝土）。各钢铁厂、水泥厂、建筑工地等部门，已建成投入生产的湿碾矿渣混凝土预制件厂有二百七十八个。最近半月来已生产出湿碾矿渣混凝土七千二百多吨，已制造出坑木支柱、枕木、大型板面、屋梁、空心柱、电线杆、地下管道等三十多种制件。
    湿碾矿渣混凝土是用高炉里流出来的矿渣加石灰、石膏、氯化钙等活化剂，经过湿碾粉碎搅拌而成的一种新型的建筑材料。质量好，性能高，成本低。它特别适合大型承重薄壁高效能混凝土结构和现代钢筋混凝土构件压轧工艺的要求，因此除了可以大量用于工业建筑和民用建筑外，还可以作为坑木、枕木和电线杆的代用材料，以及铺筑公路，修建水坝、烟道等工程，用途极为广泛。
  大跃进以来，山东省的水泥生产虽然已有极大的增长，但仍不能满足基本建设高速度发展的需要。为了解决这个问题，中共山东省委在3月中旬决定广泛发动群众，利用钢铁厂中的大量废渣制造湿碾矿渣混凝土，并号召各行各业迅速开展一个生产和使用湿碾矿渣混凝土的群众运动，争取3、4月份来一个“水泥大翻身”。各地区各部门根据省委的指示，都由领导干部亲自挂帅，普遍建立起办事机构，根据具体条件，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，大张旗鼓地开展生产湿碾矿渣混凝土的群众运动。设备条件好、技术力量比较强的单位，就充分利用现有设备，使湿碾矿渣混凝土的生产迅速走上机械化半机械化生产。如济南钢铁厂充分利用原有设备，使湿碾矿渣混凝土预制件的生产，从上料、碾压、成形、养护等五道工序全部实现了机械化和半机械化生产。目前，这个厂已经生产出一批高标号的预应力湿碾矿渣混凝土水管、桁架梁、大型屋板面等重要的建筑构件。设备条件和技术力量比较差的单位，则自力更生，因陋就简，充分发动群众，千方百计地克服困难，进行生产。如淄博市的建筑、水利、交通等单位，压碾设备不足，就到陶瓷厂和郊区人民公社去购置或借用他们的土碾、石滚稍微改装一下，配上齿轮来生产。潍坊市没有机碾就发动群众用土碾压，用磨磨、石臼捣、手捶砸；没有锅炉和钢管作养护设备，就用铁锅代锅炉，用竹管代钢管，并建成预制件养护池一百四十五个，解决了养护设备不足的困难。目前，他们不仅将水淬矿渣全部利用了起来，还将未经水淬的矿渣粉碎，大块代石子做混凝土骨架，细粒代沙子作混凝土沙浆，这样便把所有积存的矿渣都全部利用了起来。
    在这个运动中，很多单位互相支援，大搞共产主义协作。济南市在市委的统一领导下，实行了统一规划、产销定点，并采取一厂举办、几厂支援的办法，使一些设备条件和技术力量较差的单位，也能迅速生产。济南市建筑公司在建厂时，因设备不全迟迟不能投入生产，在市委的统一领导下，得到济南水泥厂、金属加工厂等兄弟单位的支援，很快就建成了一个日产四十吨左右全部机械化的湿碾矿渣混凝土预制件厂。这个厂在建成后第一天就生产出十立方预制件。
    据新华社包头电　一种用高炉里流出来的矿渣作原料生产的新的建筑材料——湿碾矿渣混凝土，已经在包钢的各个基本建设工地上广泛使用。今年，包钢在一号大型平炉、二号高炉、焦化、选矿烧结等系统工程上，将有十三万立方米的混凝土建筑物全部采用这种混凝土。这将大大节省水泥的消耗。
    冶金企业里大量产生的矿渣，过去都当作废品处理。用这种矿渣制成同普通水泥混凝土性能一样的湿碾矿渣混凝土，并广泛利用到建设工程上去，这是包钢建设者广开材料来源，力争高速度地建设包钢的一项积极的、革命性的措施。去年年底，包钢职工参考了各地综合利用矿渣的经验，决定从制造湿碾矿渣混凝土开始，大闹混凝土技术革命。原来，高炉矿渣里含有大量和水泥相同的化学成分，把矿渣加以水淬处理，然后掺合一定比例的石膏、石灰和少量水泥，作为活化剂，加以湿碾磨，以激发矿渣里潜在的化学胶结性能，就能把矿渣变成同普通水泥一样的混凝土胶结材料。职工们提出“有高炉就有水泥”、“不完全依靠国家供应的水泥，让湿碾矿渣混凝土占领混凝土工程阵地”等豪迈口号。担负预制构件生产任务的生产企业公司职工，在这场技术革命中一马当先。他们只用十五天时间，就建成了一座进行矿渣水淬处理的水渣厂。紧接着，第四工程公司职工边试验、边生产、边建厂，只花不到五万元投资和二十天时间，就建成了一座能年产四万立方米的湿碾矿渣混凝土制造车间。别的单位也都土法上马，自造设备。在不到两个月的时间内，全公司各个建筑安装单位安起了九十五部生产湿碾矿渣混凝土的设备，一边建厂，一边就生产了两万一千多立方米湿碾矿渣混凝土，运用到工程上去。许多施工单位在水泥供应不足的情况下提前完成了建设计划，有的工程公司第一季度的施工任务在2月底就完成了。
    包钢职工在大量使用这种新的混凝土以前，曾连续多次进行科学试验。试验证明：湿碾矿渣混凝土的性能和一般混凝土比起来，不但毫不逊色，而且主要原料矿渣取之不尽，用之不竭，成本也比水泥低30％左右。在强度方面，由于湿碾矿渣混凝土有后期强度较高的特点，只要提高养生温度，就可以很快达到设计强度。生产企业公司在建设一座预应力管厂房时，从基础、支柱、桁架梁，直到支承十五吨吊车的吊车梁，全部使用了湿碾矿渣混凝土。这座厂房投入生产以来，情况一直很好。
    现在，包钢职工不但把湿碾矿渣混凝土使用到各种大型工业厂房基础、桁架、大型屋面板、大块预制构件等重要的工程部位上去，而且还用矿渣试制成功热铸矿渣管，代替过去的铸铁管做下水管；试制成高级保温矿渣绵，代替冶金企业大量消耗而又来源不易的石绵板和其他保温材料。他们根据湿碾矿渣混凝土组织密实的特点，加以改进，又制成防水混凝土。生产企业公司的职工，还利用矿渣生产了大量热铸矿渣块，代替水泥铺设马路路面。
