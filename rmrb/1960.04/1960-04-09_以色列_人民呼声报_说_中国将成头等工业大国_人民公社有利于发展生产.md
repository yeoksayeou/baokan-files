Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from the Jerusalem, Israel area: The Israeli Communist Party's newspaper "People's Voice" published a special column article on the 5th entitled "People's China Continues the Great Leap Forward," introducing the main production increase targets proposed at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China.

The article pointed out that the significance of these figures is that 650 million Chinese people are turning China into a first-rate industrial power in the world, and its development speed far exceeds that of major capitalist countries during their corresponding levels of industrial development. The speed of China's agricultural development is also something that capitalist countries cannot dream of.

The article also pointed out that the bourgeois newspapers are once again clamoring about China's organization of urban people's communes, but the fact is that since 1958, these communes have been developing and have proven to be particularly capable of liberating women from housework, while also being conducive to the development of production.

The article pointed out that 1960 is the third year of the Great Leap Forward for the Chinese people. Due to the Great Leap Forward, the main targets of the Chinese people's Second Five-Year Plan were completed in two years. Now, plans are being made for the remaining three years. The Great Leap Forward has enabled the Chinese people to reduce the time it takes to surpass Britain from fifteen years to ten years, and it is now expected to win this victory even earlier. This is a major contribution to the overall advance target of the socialist camp, which is to exceed the total production of all capitalist countries by 1965.

The article emphasized that the achievements of the Chinese people's Great Leap Forward are of particular significance to Asian and African countries. Because on the whole, the economies of Asian and African countries are very underdeveloped. However, China's experience has proved that in Asian and African countries, taking the capitalist road cannot enable them to catch up with developed capitalist countries, and only through a socialist economy can this goal be achieved.

    以色列“人民呼声报”说
    中国将成头等工业大国
    人民公社有利于发展生产
    新华社8日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列共产党机关报“人民呼声报”5日发表题为“人民中国继续大跃进”的专栏文章，介绍了中国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上提出的主要增产指标。
    文章指出，这些数字的意义是，六亿五千万中国人民正在把中国变成世界上一个头等的工业大国，其发展速度远远超过主要资本主义国家在它们相应的工业发展水平时期的速度。中国农业发展的速度，也是资本主义国家所不能梦想的。
    文章还指出，资产阶级报纸就中国组织城市人民公社一事又大肆叫嚣，但是事实是：自从1958年以来，这些公社一直在发展，而且证明它特别能把妇女从家务中解放出来，同时有利于发展生产。
    文章指出，1960年是中国人民大跃进的第三年。由于大跃进，中国人民第二个五年计划的主要指标在两年内完成了。现在正在为余下的三年另订计划。大跃进使中国人民能把超过英国的时间从十五年减少为十年，现在并可望更早地赢得这一胜利。这是对整个社会主义阵营的前进目标的重大贡献，这个目标是要在1965年超过所有资本主义国家的生产量的总和。
    文章强调说，中国人民大跃进的成就，对亚非各国来说，意义特别重大。因为整个说来，亚非国家的经济是很不发达的。可是中国的经验已经证明，在亚非国家里，走资本主义道路不能使它们赶上发达的资本主义国家，只有通过社会主义经济，才能达到这个目的。
