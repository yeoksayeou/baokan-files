    German Scholar Publishes Book Exposing "People's Capitalism"

    In recent years, the German Democratic Republic has published many works exposing the exploitative essence of capitalist relations of production in West Germany. Fabiankowsky's "The 'People's Capitalism' in Theory and Practice" is one of them. This book has now been translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union.

    In this book, the author exposes the essence of West Germany's "People's Capitalism" and its main content, "People's Shares." The author points out that the purpose of bourgeois thinkers in creating the theory of "People's Capitalism" is to distort Marxism-Leninism, obliterate the distinction between capitalist and socialist societies, and try to "replace" socialist ideas with so-called better and more attractive ideas. The theory of "People's Capitalism" comes from the ideological system of modern imperialism.

    The author believes that "People's Capitalism" is not only an ideological phenomenon, but also a most active practical activity of imperialism. The basis of this activity is the inevitable objective law of capitalist economics. The author points out that in order to obtain more profits, West German monopoly capitalists strive to expand the scope of capitalist accumulation, increase investment, and expand production. The "People's Capitalism" system can precisely guarantee that they obtain more supplementary funds. Under this system, West German monopoly capitalists massively promote small-denomination stocks. They force workers and small office workers to accept a wage system that compels them to use a portion of their wages to buy stocks, providing West German monopoly capitalists with huge supplementary funds. The author points out that these small-denomination stocks are one of the special forms of capitalists "splitting" wages. The holders of "People's Shares" - workers, small office workers, etc. - are actually isolated and scattered from each other, and in reality, have no influence on the affairs of joint-stock companies.

### 德国学者著书揭露“人民资本主义”

    德国学者著书揭露“人民资本主义”
    德意志民主共和国近年来出版了许多揭露西德资本主义生产关系剥削实质的著作，法毕翁凯的“理论和实践上的‘人民资本主义’”一书，就是其中之一。这本书现在已经译成俄文在苏联出版。
    作者在本书中揭露了西德“人民资本主义”和它的主要内容——“人民股票”的实质。作者指出，资产阶级思想家制造“人民资本主义”的理论，目的在歪曲马克思列宁主义，抹煞资本主义社会和社会主义社会的区别，并力图用所谓更好的和更吸引人的思想来“代替”社会主义思想。“人民资本主义”理论，来自现代帝国主义的思想体系。
    作者认为，“人民资本主义”不仅是一种思想现象，而且是帝国主义的一种最积极的实践活动，这种活动的基础是不可避免的资本主义经济的客观规律性。作者指出，西德垄断资本家为了取得更多的利润，力图扩大资本主义积累的范围，力图增加投资，扩大生产。“人民资本主义”制度，恰恰能够保证他们获得更多的补充资金。在这种制度下，西德垄断资本家大量推销小额股票。他们强迫工人和小职员接受这样一种工资制度，使工人和小职员不得不用一部分工资来购买股票，为西德垄断资本家提供巨额的补充资金。作者指出，这种小额股票是资本家“分割”工资的特殊形式之一。“人民股票”的持有者——工人、小职员等，由于彼此分散隔离，实际上对股份公司的事务不发生任何影响。
