Delivering Mail Faster and More Accurately
Representative Luo Shuzhen Discusses Her Experience of Delivering Over 1.2 Million Letters Without Error

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. These reports express the soaring aspirations of the people nationwide to further change the face of our motherland and showcase the brilliant prospects of the continued leap forward in our motherland’s socialist construction. With the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will surely be able to victoriously complete this year's national economic plan!

These past few days, I have been very excited and moved. Although I am not good at speaking, I would like to share my surging emotions.

I am a mail carrier from the Public Security Street Branch of the Beijing Post Office. Under the glorious light of the General Line, our delivery work has also made a great leap forward.

Delivery work is the final stage of postal communication. If we send letters and newspapers to the wrong addresses, delay them, or lose them, it will cause losses to the country and the people. The Party has always taught us that we need to not only constantly improve our professional skills, but more importantly, correctly understand the significance of doing a good job in delivery work, love this work, and conscientiously treat every letter and newspaper we deliver. Therefore, in every aspect of my delivery work, I always concentrate my thoughts, focus my attention, and never let a letter or newspaper be delivered carelessly without being clearly identified. In this way, errors cannot slip through. Since August 1953, I have delivered more than 1,290,000 pieces of mail and newspapers without making a single mistake.

Eliminating Errors by Recognizing Handwriting, Speeding Up by Turning the "Tail" into the "Head"

Since the Great Leap Forward, with the in-depth development of ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution, the number of people sending letters and reading newspapers and magazines has greatly increased. When we think of everyone striving for every second to realize the leap forward plan, we feel that our responsibility is even greater.

Serving the Party's central work and serving the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction are the primary tasks of the post and telecommunications bureau. Specifically, for our delivery work, the first priority is to deliver letters and newspapers to organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools quickly and accurately. Many unit names are similar, and one careless move can lead to mistakes. For example, "Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters" and "Beijing Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," "Girls' No. 9 Middle School" and "No. 29 Middle School," and so on. When delivering these easily confused items, we must be extra careful in checking them up, down, left, right, front, and back. In February of this year, I encountered a letter addressed to "Beijing No. 29 Middle School." This middle school was within my delivery area. I saw a stamp on top of the character "北" (Bei, North), but how could there be ink marks next to the stamp? I peeled off the stamp and found another character "新" (Xin, New) underneath. "New Beijing No. 29 Middle School," what was going on? Looking more closely, the character below "二十九" (Ershijiu, Twenty-Nine) was not "中" (Zhong, Middle) either, but "号" (Hao, Number), because it was written in cursive, it looked like "中" at first glance. This letter was originally addressed to No. 29 Wanshou Road, New Beijing. If I hadn't thought carefully, it would have been mistakenly delivered to Municipal No. 29 Middle School, delaying things.

To better serve organizations and enterprises, I adjusted the delivery route. Units such as the Power Supply Bureau and the Public Bus Company's main station used to be at the end of the delivery route, so letters and newspapers arrived relatively late, which had some impact on their work and study. However, the alley at the beginning of the delivery route was mostly inhabited by residents, and when I delivered the newspapers, many people were not yet awake, and some households even had not opened their doors. I changed the tail to the head and the head to the tail. This allowed these organizations and enterprises to receive letters and newspapers earlier, while also taking into account the people's living habits. Both parties felt that it was timely and satisfactory.

Since the Great Leap Forward, tens of thousands of women have actively participated in production. Those left at home are often elderly people. It is difficult for them to come to the post office to pick up parcels, remittances, or buy stamps, and they need our help the most. I often collect remittances and parcels, buy stamps for them, and sometimes read letters to illiterate old women. Once, I delivered a letter to Grandma Ma at No. 4 Nian'er Hutong. She was illiterate and eager to know what the letter said. So I read the letter to her. When she heard that her old mother in Tianjin had recovered from her illness, she happily said to me, "You are such a good girl! If it weren't for you, how could I have known this good news immediately? Thank you so much!" When I left, she kept sending me to the gate, watching me ride my bike far away before going back.

Treating Others as You Would Like to Be Treated, Delivering "Blind" Letters, Recognizing "Two" and "Three" Under a Magnifying Glass

Some of the letters we deliver have addresses that are unclear, incomplete, or even written incorrectly. Although it is difficult to deliver such "blind" letters, I think that the senders did not intend to write them this way, and they all hope that these letters can be delivered. Especially after the nationwide upsurge of the cultural revolution, many working people have shaken off the label of illiteracy. They can pick up a pen and write letters themselves. This is such a joyful event, but because they have not been writing for long, some people inevitably write less neatly and less clearly. I myself was originally someone who did not recognize many characters, so it is easier to understand the joy of being able to write a letter yourself after being illiterate. Therefore, we always try our best to find ways to deliver these letters. Some time ago, I encountered such a letter, the envelope only wrote "Ji Jing Qian Nei" (To Beijing Inside Qianmen), and there were two more characters behind, but after repeated recognition, it was impossible to see what the characters were. There was no alley name and no house number. The Qianmen area was so big, where should I deliver it? I discussed it with several comrades, and someone said that the first character looked like "五" (Wu, Five). I asked about No. 5 in many alleys, but never found it. Finally, I asked an old dispatcher at the Power Supply Bureau. He squinted his eyes and looked at it carefully, and said to me, "The first character looks like ‘水’ (Shui, Water)." His words reminded me, and I quickly ran to the Water Meter Workshop of the Shuncheng Street Water Company, and sure enough, I found it. The dispatcher told me that the recipient was very happy and asked him to apologize to me, and in the future, he must ask the other party to write clearly. As for me, I was very happy to be able to deliver the letter. What does it matter to ask a few more times and walk a little further?

The Party has educated us that in socialist competition, we must promote the spirit of collectivism, adhere to the principle of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, and common improvement. Through practical work, my understanding of this principle has become increasingly profound. We mail carriers have to deliver thousands of letters and newspapers every day. It is far from enough for just one person to be error-free and provide good service. Only when everyone reaches an advanced level can the delivery work be truly done well.

I used to work in an advanced group (Group 1). However, the comrades in Group 2 said that their group's work was relatively poor and asked the leadership to send me there to help improve the work. I felt that going to work in Group 2 would definitely encounter many difficulties, but a Communist Party member should go to the most difficult places, where they can do more work for the Party. I took the initiative to propose to the Party branch to go to Group 2, and the branch agreed with my opinion and encouraged me to help this group improve its work.

Together with all the comrades in the group, I analyzed the reasons for the group's backwardness and found that the main reasons were that ideological education was not done well, internal unity was not good enough, and some comrades lacked professional knowledge. Under the leadership of the Party branch, we strengthened political study; carried out criticism and self-criticism; and established a quality analysis system. I also often used some practical examples to draw everyone's attention and further enhance everyone's sense of political responsibility. For example, once, I saw a letter with "No. 29 Middle School" written on the envelope, but I always felt that the character "二" (Er, Two) was particularly small and did not match the characters "十" (Shi, Ten) and "九" (Jiu, Nine). I took a magnifying glass to look at it, and it turned out to be the character "三" (San, Three). The comrades in the group all said: "We must not be careless in our work. A little carelessness will lead to mistakes. We should always be responsible to the masses and be responsible to the masses everywhere."

The Whole Group Unites, Strives for Advancement, Has an Open Mind, and Firm Confidence

The Party branch pointed out that in order to unite all the comrades in the group to do a good job, we must not only care about everyone ideologically and in their work, but also care about everyone in their lives. Some comrades in the group lived in single dormitories. When I saw that their clothes had torn openings, I helped sew them up. Estimating that they would be late returning from delivering mail today, I bought them food. Sometimes they saw that I was busy and secretly helped me clean my bicycle. In this way, the comrades in the whole group not only cooperated well in their work, but also became one in life. Any problems in their thoughts and work could be discussed at any time.

After the continuous help of the Party branch and the active efforts of all the comrades in the group, the political atmosphere in Group 2 became strong, unity was strengthened, and it finally became an advanced group. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the thoughts of all the comrades in the group became brighter, their enthusiasm was even stronger, and their requirements for their work were even stricter. They not only eliminated errors, but also further improved their service.

Attending the National Congress of Heroes made me receive a profound education on the General Line. The Party said so correctly, "One person's advancement is just a single horse, but everyone's advancement can move mountains and seas." I felt that I had not done enough in leading everyone to leap forward together. After returning to the bureau after the meeting, I was very excited to know that the whole group continued to maintain all-red quality. At the same time, I also found that individual comrades still lacked a correct understanding of delivery work, and some comrades were not careful enough in their work, and there was still a possibility of making mistakes. According to the instructions of the Party branch, I conveyed the spirit of the congress to everyone, talked about the moving deeds of the heroic models, and led everyone to study the advanced thoughts and advanced experiences of the heroic models together. Everyone felt that their minds were more open, their whole bodies were full of strength, and their confidence and determination to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and be the advanced were stronger. There was a young mail carrier in our group who was originally not at ease with his work, thinking that delivery work was not promising and meaningless. After listening to the transmission of the spirit of the Congress of Heroes, he began to realize that all work needed by the people is promising and meaningful. After the change in his thinking, he not only fell in love with delivery work and actively improved his service, but also cared about the collective. The unity and cooperation of the entire group have also been further strengthened. Those who operate quickly help those who operate slowly, and those with a small workload help those with a large workload. The time for going out for delivery has generally been advanced.

Achieving "Eight Considerations" and Striving for "Seven Satisfactions"

Since the Great Leap Forward, in order to better adapt to the needs of the new situation, we have systematically summarized many of our piecemeal experiences in improving service and put forward "Eight Considerations" (consideration for organizations and enterprises, construction workers, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the elderly, users with mobility difficulties, busy users, ordinary citizens, and general subscribers) and "Seven Satisfactions" (satisfaction with accurate delivery, satisfaction with fast delivery, satisfaction with safe delivery, satisfaction with good service attitude, satisfaction with clear explanation of procedures, satisfaction with cooperation with dispatchers, and satisfaction with eliminating more "blind" letters) as the standard for improving service. Everyone is more thoughtful and proactive in their service than in the past. Everyone actively helps users with difficulties handle various postal and telecommunications services, so that they can solve problems without leaving their homes. For example, in January of this year, the whole group sent nearly 10,000 letters on behalf of residents and collected remittances and parcels more than 200 times. Every comrade in the group has received letters of praise from users, saying that we are "good mail carriers educated by the Party and Chairman Mao." Everyone has been greatly encouraged.

Since December last year, we have actively responded to the Party's call and launched an upsurge of technical revolution. In the past, our tools and equipment were very simple, a smooth big table, several people used together, and various utensils were stuffed in a cabinet, and it was very messy to take them out when needed. Changing this backward situation is also our requirement. Therefore, in the technical revolution movement, everyone was very enthusiastic and quickly achieved results. Now, the delivery room is lined with delivery tables designed by us, one for each person, and various utensils can be placed in the delivery table, which is neat and convenient. A transmission line is erected above the delivery table. Letters that are returned or transferred, as long as they are placed on the iron clip and the switch is turned on, will be concentrated on the return and transfer letter processing table along the transmission line, and they will all be processed during the shift. In this way, the indoor operation time can be shortened by at least 20 minutes every day, and letters and newspapers can be delivered earlier. Mail carriers no longer have to walk back and forth to transmit letters, and signal equipment for dispatching and commanding has also been installed in the delivery room. When the newspaper arrives and the registered letter is registered, they are all indicated by signals, and there is no need to shout loudly like in the past. The order in the entire delivery room is also better and quieter. Everyone is more happy to work.

Better Still, Higher Still

Now our entire group has been error-free for eight consecutive months. Eight of the nine people in the whole group have reached the level of advanced mail carriers, and the other person is also close to the advanced level. In January of this year, our group and two members of the group were respectively selected as advanced collective representatives and advanced individual representatives to attend the Municipal Congress of Heroes. Our group also launched counterpart competitions with two other delivery groups, learning from each other, helping each other, and the competition was in full swing. Now these two groups have also created records of being error-free for more than five months and two months respectively, leaping forward together. However, we will never be satisfied with these small achievements. We must listen to the Party's words, have great ambitions, establish lofty aspirations, constantly revolutionize our thoughts, and constantly leap forward in our work. In the next three years, we will guarantee that there will be no errors in the delivery of letters and newspapers, and at the same time, we must provide better service and higher efficiency, and resolutely be good communication soldiers in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction!

Fellow representatives! The 1960 national economic plan that our congress is about to pass is a great leap forward plan. Our group's comrades are determined to contribute all their strength to the realization of this year's leap forward plan together with the people of the capital and the people of the whole country. We must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, better arm our minds, hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, continue to make great strides in the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, and guarantee that there will be no errors in the delivery of letters and newspapers in the next three years. At the same time, we must provide better service and higher efficiency, and resolutely be good communication soldiers in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction!

    把邮件送得更快更准
    罗淑珍代表谈投递一百二十多万封信没出差错的体会主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理的报告。这些报告表达了全国人民进一步改变祖国面貌的壮志雄心，展示了祖国社会主义建设继续跃进的光辉图景。有了党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，我们一定能够胜利地完成今年的国民经济计划！
    这几天来，我很兴奋，很激动，虽然不会讲话，也想说一说我这沸腾的心情。
    我是北京市邮局公安街支局的一个邮递员。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们投递工作也有了很大的跃进。
    投递工作是邮政通信的最后一关。如果我们把信件、报刊送错了，延误了，或者丢失了，就会给国家和人民造成损失。党经常教导我们，不但需要不断提高业务水平，更重要的是正确认识做好邮递工作的重要意义，热爱这项工作，认真地对待自己投送的每一封信，每一份报刊。因此，我在投递工作的每个环节上，始终思想集中，全神贯注，不看清楚，决不让一封信一份报刊草率出手。这样，差错就无法漏过去了，从1953年8月以来，我已经投送了一百二十九万多件信件和报刊，没有出过差错。
    消灭差错辨字迹，加快速度“尾”作“头”
    大跃进以来，随着思想革命、技术革命、文化革命的深入发展，寄信的人，看报纸看杂志的人，都大大增加了。当我们想到大家为了实现跃进计划都在分秒必争的时候，就感到自己的责任更加重大了。
    为党的中心工作服务，为社会主义建设大跃进服务，是邮电局的首要任务，具体到我们的邮递工作，首先就是要把机关、工厂、企业、学校等的信件、报刊送得又快、又准。不少单位名称相似，一不小心，就会搞错。如“北京中苏友好协会总会”和“北京市中苏友好协会”、“女九中”和“二十九中”等等。这些容易混淆送错的，投送时就要上下左右前后，看得格外仔细。今年2月间，我遇到一封寄给“北京二十九中”的信，这个中学就在我的投递界内。我看到“北”字上头贴着一张邮票，可是，邮票旁边怎么会有墨迹呢？我把邮票揭起来，发现底下还有个“新”字。“新北京二十九中”，这是怎么回事呢？再仔细一瞧，“二十九”下边的那个字，也不是“中”。而是
  “号”，因为写得了草，猛看像个“中”字，这封信原来是寄给新北京万寿路二十九号的，如果不仔细捉摸，就会错送到市二十九中去，把事情给耽误了。
    为了更好地为机关、企业服务，我把投递路线做了调整。像供电局、公共汽车公司总站等等单位，过去都排列在投递路线的末尾，信报送到比较晚，对于这些单位的工作和学习，都有一些影响。而排列在投递路线前头的那条胡同，住的多数是居民，当我把报送去的时候，不少人还没有起床，有的住户甚至门也没有开。我把尾改作头，头改作尾，这样一来，就使得这些机关企业能够更早地收到信件和报刊，同时照顾到了人民的生活习惯，双方都感到及时和满意。
    大跃进以来，成千上万的妇女们踊跃地参加了生产。留在家里的，往往是些老年人，要上邮电局来取包裹、取汇款或者买邮票，都有困难，他们最需要我们的帮助。我经常替他们代取汇款、包裹，代买邮票，有时还给不认字的老大娘念信。一次我给辇儿胡同四号马老大娘送一封信。她不识字急于想知道信里说些什么。我就把信念给她听。她听到在天津的老母亲病已经好了，高兴地对我说：“你这姑娘太好了！要不是你，这个好消息，我怎么能立刻知道呢？真太感谢你了！”走的时候，她一直把我送到大门外，看着我骑车走得很远很远才回去。
    将心比心送“瞎”信放大镜下识“二”“三”
    我们投送的信件中，有一些信的地址写得不清楚，不完全，有的甚至写错了。这样的“瞎”信送起来虽然有困难，但我想，寄信人决不是有意这么写的，他们都希望这些信一样能够送到。特别是全国掀起文化革命高潮以后，许多劳动人民都摘掉了文盲的帽子，他们能够提起笔来自己写信，这是一件使人多么高兴的大事，但是，正因为写字的时间还不长，有些人难免写得不太整齐，不太清楚，我自己原来也是一个识字不多的人，更容易体会到一个从不识字到能够自己亲笔写信以后的欢欣的心情。因此，我们总是千方百计，想法把这些信送到。前些日子，我就遇到过这样一封信，信封上只写着“寄京前内”，后面还有两个字，再三辨认，也看不清楚是什么字。既没有胡同名称，又没有门牌号码，前门内地区又这么大，上哪儿送呢？我和几个同志研究，有人说第一个字有些像“五”。我问了不少胡同的五号，始终没有问到。最后问到供电局一位老收发。他眯着眼睛仔细端详了一番，对我说：“第一个字好像是个‘水’字。”他的话提醒了我，赶快跑到顺城街自来水公司水表工段，果然问到了。收发员告诉我，收信人十分高兴，还托他向我表示歉意，以后一定要对方写清楚。至于我，能够把信送到，心里就很愉快了，多问几次，多走些路，又算得了什么呢？
    党教育我们，在社会主义竞赛中，要发扬集体主义精神，坚持互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高的原则。通过实际工作，我对这个原则的体会也愈来愈深刻。我们投递员每天要投送成千上万的信件、报刊。单单一个人不出差错，服务好，那是十分不够的。只有大家都达到先进水平才能真正把邮递工作做好。
    我原来是在一个先进小组工作的（第一小组）。可是第二小组的同志说，他们小组工作比较差，要求领导派我到他们那里去，帮助搞好工作。我觉得到第二小组去工作，一定会碰到许多困难，但是共产党员应该到最困难的地方去，在那里，可以为党做更多的工作。我就主动向党支部提出上第二小组去，支部同意了我的意见，还鼓励我帮助这个小组把工作搞好。
    我和全组同志一道，分析了小组落后的原因，发现主要是思想教育工作做得差，内部团结不够好，有些同志业务知识也不足。在党支部的领导下，我们加强了政治学习；开展了批评和自我批评，建立了质量分析制度。我还经常用一些实际例子来引起大家的注意，进一步提高大家的政治责任心。比如，有一次，我看见一封信，封面写着“二十九中”，可是我总觉得“二”字特别小，与“十”、“九”两字不相称，我拿来一面放大镜一照，原来是个“三”字。小组同志们都说：“在工作中可不能有一点马虎，稍不留神，就出差错，我们应该时时对群众负责，处处对群众负责。”
    全组团结争先进心胸开阔信心坚
    党支部指出，为了团结全组同志做好工作，不但要从思想上、工作上关心大家，而且要从生活上关心大家。小组有些同志住在单人宿舍里。我看见他们衣服挂了口子，就帮助给缝好。估计他们今天送信回来要晚一些就给他们买好饭菜。有时他们看见我比较忙，就偷偷地帮助我把自行车擦亮了。这样，全组的同志不仅工作上协作得好，而且在生活上也打成一片了，思想上和工作上有什么问题都能随时交谈了。
    经过党支部的不断帮助和全组同志的积极努力，第二小组的政治空气浓厚了，团结加强了，终于变成了先进小组。学习党的八届八中全会文件以后，全组同志的思想更亮堂了，干劲鼓得更足了，对自己的工作要求的更加严格了，不但消灭了差错，而且进一步改善了服务。
    参加全国群英大会，使我受到了一次深刻的总路线的教育。党说得多么正确，“一人先进只是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山造海”。我感到自己在带动大家共同跃进方面，还作得很不够。开完大会回局以后，知道全组继续保持质量全红，感到十分兴奋。同时我也发现个别同志对投递工作还缺乏正确的认识，有的同志工作还不够细心，仍旧有出差错的可能。根据党支部指示，我向大家传达了大会的精神，讲了英雄模范们的动人事迹，带动大家一起学习英雄模范们的先进思想和先进经验。大家感到心胸更加开阔，浑身充满力量，学先进、赶先进、当先进的信心更强了，决心更大了。我们小组里有一个青年投递员，本来工作不安心，认为投递工作没出息，没意思。听了群英会精神的传达，他开始认识到，凡是人民需要的工作，都有出息，有意思。思想转变以后，他不但爱上了邮递工作，积极改善服务，而且关心集体了。整个小组的团结和协作也进一步加强了。操作快的帮助操作慢的，业务量小的帮助业务量大的，出去投递的时间普遍提早了。
    做到“八体贴”力争“七满意”
    大跃进以来，为了更好地适应新形势的需要，我们把改善服务方面的许多点滴经验比较系统地总结了起来，提出了“八体贴”（体贴机关企业、建筑工人、军烈属、老年人、出门有困难的用户、工作忙的用户、一般市民、一般订户）、“七满意”（送的准满意、送的快满意、送得安全满意、服务态度好满意、手续交代清楚满意、和收发协作满意、消灭“瞎”信多满意），作为改善服务的标准。大家在服务上比过去做得更周到、更主动了，每个人都积极帮助有困难的用户办理各种邮电业务，使他们不出门就解决了问题。像今年1月份，全组就代居民寄出了近一万封信，代取汇款包裹二百多次。小组里每个同志都受到了用户的来信表扬，说我们是“党和毛主席教育出来的好邮递员”。大家都受到很大的鼓舞。
    去年12月以来，我们积极响应党的号召，掀起了技术革命的高潮。过去我们的工具设备很简单，一张光光的大桌子，几个人合着用，各种用具都塞在一个柜子里，用的时候拿得很乱。改变这种落后状况，也正是我们的要求。因此，在技术革命运动中，大家的劲头都很足，很快就收到了效果。现在投递室里排列着我们设计的投递桌，一个人一张，各种用具都可以放在投递桌里，又整齐，又方便，投递桌上面架起了传送线，退回去的信、转出去的信，只要放在铁夹子上，把电门一开，就都顺着传送线集中到退转信处理台，当班就都处理完了。这样，室内作业时间每天至少可以缩短二十分钟、信件、报刊可以送到的更早。投递员再也不用走来走去的传信，投递室内还安装了调度指挥的信号设备，报纸到了，挂号信登记完了，都用信号表示，再也不必像过去那样大声招呼了。整个投递室秩序也更好了，更安静了。大家干起活来也更加愉快了。
    好了还要更好高了还要更高
    现在我们全组已经连续八个月没有发生差错，全组九个人，有八个人已经达到先进投递员水平，还有一个人也已经接近先进水平。今年1月，我们小组和小组的两个组员，分别被评选为出席市群英大会的先进集体代表和先进个人代表。我们小组还同其他两个投递小组展开了对口赛，互相学习、互相帮助，竞赛热火朝天，现在这两个小组也分别创造了连续五个多月和两个多月没有出差错的记录，共同跃进。但是，我们决不满足于这些微小的成绩，我们一定要听党的话，立大志，树雄心，思想不断革命，工作不断跃进。
    代表同志们！我们这次大会将要通过的1960年国民经济计划是一个伟大的跃进计划。我们小组同志决心和首都人民一道，和全国人民一道，为实现今年的跃进计划贡献出自己的全部力量。我们一定要认真学习毛主席的著作，更好地武装我们的头脑，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，继续大闹技术革命和文化革命，在今后三年内，投递信件、报刊保证不发生一件差错，同时要做到服务更好、效率更高，坚决当好社会主义建设大跃进的通信兵！
