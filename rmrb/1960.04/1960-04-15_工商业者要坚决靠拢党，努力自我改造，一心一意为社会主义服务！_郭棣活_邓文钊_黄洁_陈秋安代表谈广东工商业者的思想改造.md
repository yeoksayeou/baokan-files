Chairman and fellow comrades:

    Communist Cooperation is a Practical Socialist Education for Industrial and Commercial Businessmen
      
    We completely agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state's final accounts and budget, and we must resolutely implement them and strive for their complete realization.

    Under the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, our country has achieved even greater leaps and more brilliant victories in 1959. With an unprecedented rate of development, we overfulfilled the tasks of the country's Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, completing it in just two years, an achievement that has shocked China and the world. Because of this glorious achievement, we can free up our hands to do more work in the remaining three years of the Second Five-Year Plan. It is certain that the next three years (1960 to 1962) will be three years of continued leap forward and even higher-speed development on the basis of past achievements. With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the efforts of the 650 million people of the country, and the support and assistance of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, we are full of confidence and determination to advance victoriously under the brilliant light of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and to achieve the same and even greater achievements. However, although our country has undergone ten years of economic construction, it has not yet completely changed its poor and backward state. For this reason, we must continue to work hard to gradually build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture. To achieve this great task, we must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and further implement the "policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and simultaneously developing agriculture rapidly." This is a complete policy of socialist construction that has been tested by countless historical facts, and is a summary of the experiences of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the ten years of our country, especially the great leap forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, and is a creative application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China.

    In order to rapidly develop agriculture, we in Guangdong are vigorously carrying out a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation (referred to as the four modernizations), in order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, and we also require the rapid development of industry, especially heavy industry, to support agriculture. Now, workers, peasants and other working people throughout the province are responding to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under this glorious banner, are marching towards the "four modernizations", working selflessly and forging ahead courageously! At the same time, under the influence of the noble communist style, a large number of heroic models who disregard everything for socialist construction have emerged in various parts of Guangdong. The heroic deeds of the fire-fighting heroes of the "Makou Incident" in Yingde County, Guangdong Province, are a vivid example. When a fire broke out in the Makou Paper Mill in Yingde County, public security cadres and police from the Makou Pyrite Mine, in order to save state property and dedicate themselves to the interests of the country, rushed into the thick smoke and flames without fear. When the fire was extinguished, the diesel suddenly exploded, and unfortunately twelve comrades heroically sacrificed and twenty-nine comrades were injured. The heroic deeds of the Makou public security cadres and police are a brilliant example of dedicating themselves to the interests of the country. When the news reached all parts of the country, they plunged into this great rescue effort, regardless of everything, to support and rescue their class brothers who had been burned, and many touching heroic figures emerged. A brand new relationship between people has been established, and the spirit of communist cooperation has been developed. As industrial and commercial businessmen, we are burning and moved inside when we hear so many heroic deeds and see so many moving scenes! These vivid facts are a practical socialist education for us. With these heroic figures, communist style and communist spirit of cooperation, our socialist construction will be able to develop at a high speed, and will be invincible and achieve even greater achievements.

    The Assessment of "Great Progress, But Still Need to Reform" Fully Reflects the Objective Political and Ideological Status of Industrial and Commercial Businessmen

    Encouraged and promoted by the country's excellent situation, and educated and influenced by the communist style and spirit of cooperation of the working class, what is the situation of our industrial and commercial businessmen, and what attitude will we take?

    Since the anti-rightist rectification campaign, over the past year, under the leadership and education of the Party and the help of the workers, Guangdong industrial and commercial businessmen have made great progress in accepting socialist transformation and actively participating in socialist construction. They have realized the importance of the Party's leadership and taken a step closer to the Party; they have worked with the workers and masses or participated in farm training organized by the industrial and commercial circles, and have shown some performance, gradually changing their views and attitudes towards the working people; they have achieved results and made contributions in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in enterprises. According to our understanding of the statistics of 751 industrial and commercial businessmen in 23 factories and enterprises in Jiangmen City, there were a total of 186 advanced production (work) pacesetters (including first, second and third class) in 1958; in 1959, it increased to 316. Zheng Decai, an industrial and commercial businessman in Haikou City, has been rated as an advanced producer every quarter in the four years from the joint venture in 1956 to the end of 1959, and has been rated as first class 14 times, and the rest as second and third class. This is the most outstanding example. In the "four modernizations" movement that is currently being carried out, industrial and commercial businessmen throughout the province are generally engaged in this movement in their own work posts, under the direct leadership of the Party committee, and many people are able to work hard day and night, and some have also formulated plans in conjunction with the "four modernizations" and demanded to put forward two or three reforms before "May Day" and "July 1st". These facts show that Guangdong industrial and commercial businessmen have shifted from despising labor to participating in labor practice, learning from the working people, and beginning to transition to the working people, which is a huge change. However, this is only a beginning, and it is still 108,000 miles away from the heroes of the Makou Incident who have a communist style. Generally, industrial and commercial businessmen still have duality, and the nature of the bourgeoisie has not been completely changed. Therefore, their doubts, resistance and dissatisfaction with the General Line, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes were reflected last year, and Guangdong is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, and is also subject to the influence of foreign capitalist ideas at any time. Therefore, the repetitive and sometimes cold and sometimes hot changes in the thinking of the Guangdong business community are more significant than those of the general industrial and commercial businessmen in the country. In the current "four modernizations" movement, we have focused on investigating the performance of some industrial and commercial circles in Jiangmen City. It is reflected in the department store industry that there are "eight no's and six fears" in their thinking. The so-called eight no's are: (1) No money, no way, (2) No technology, no way, (3) Factories can do it, department stores can't, (4) Large departments can do it, small departments can't, (5) No raw materials, no way, (6) Foreign methods work, local methods don't, (7) No equipment, no way, (8) No motor, no way. The so-called six fears are: (1) Fear of affecting targets and tasks, (2) Fear of wasting money, (3) Fear that raw materials cannot be solved, (4) Fear that leaders will not support, (5) Fear of not arranging well, (6) Fear of hardship and unwillingness to mention it. These situations are undoubtedly reflections of bourgeois thinking. Looking at other industries or other cities and counties, it is generally believed that "four modernizations" are the business of technicians and have nothing to do with them, and most of them take an indifferent attitude; some hope to buy ready-made ones, or require foreign goods to be imported; some watch the workers do it, follow the crowd, and reluctantly do it themselves, and have not been involved in the movement, pushing and moving; some have the idea of passing the test, and they are the team leader or technicians, so it is not good to do nothing, and they put forward one thing to perfunctorily deal with it; some hope to make a splash, but they are discouraged and frustrated after failure. For example, a private person in Meixian Livestock Farm who experimented with artificial incubation of chickens failed in the first and second experiments. He was very panicked and afraid of being punished, and asked to voluntarily compensate for the losses. Later, with the care and encouragement of the Party, he finally succeeded, and then he realized the greatness of the Party and the insignificance of his own calculation of personal gains and losses. These situations also show that while industrial and commercial businessmen have made great progress, there are still many problems. Although they have participated in socialist construction work, the wavering and wait-and-see attitude of some people, or a considerable number of people, still exists, and they will not have feelings for socialist enterprises, and on the other hand, they still miss capitalism. For example, some people in Meixian said, "New kindness is thick, old friendship is hard to forget," and some people in other places also said: "They have a heart of longing for socialism, and they have a feeling of nostalgia for capitalism," which strongly reflects this duality. Therefore, this kind of feeling towards socialism is not 108,000 miles away from the heroes of the Makou Incident and the many working class brothers who work selflessly? One is a spirit of selflessness, a soaring enthusiasm, and when necessary, they can sacrifice their lives for the interests of the country and to save their class brothers, while some of us are still wandering and hesitating at the crossroads. Judging from these situations, we still need to continue to work hard and carry out fundamental reforms in political stance and ideological understanding in order to truly transition to the working class, so that we can truly catch up with the requirements of the development of the situation. These situations also prove that the assessment of "great progress, but still need to reform" made by the National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce representative congress on the current industrial and commercial businessmen fully reflects the objective political and ideological status of industrial and commercial businessmen and is completely correct.
          To Truly Serve the Cause of Socialism Positively, One Must No Longer Put "Me" First

    Another situation for us industrial and commercial businessmen is that we put personal interests above national interests in everything we do, and put "me" first, starting from personal gains and losses. This is completely incompatible with socialist collectivism. Looking at the "four modernizations" of technical innovation and technical revolution movement, as mentioned above, many examples are manifestations of putting "me" first. If industrial and commercial businessmen want to truly serve the cause of socialism positively, they must fundamentally change this duality, eliminate the negative and backward capitalist side, and become a completely socialist side; they must abandon putting "me" first and change to putting politics in command. During the representative congress of the National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Chairman Liu said to us that we should "take care of one end and lean to one side," take care of the national interests and collective interests, and lean to the side of socialism. This is a prescription for our current political and ideological status of industrial and commercial businessmen. The People's Daily editorial also said well, "Take care of one end" and "lean to one side" - this is the key issue for the current industrial and commercial businessmen to further accept socialist transformation. In the process of socialist transformation, every industrial and commercial businessman inevitably faces the relationship between personal interests and the interests of the people. Is it to take care of personal interests and disregard national interests and the interests of the people? Or is it to take care of both personal interests and national interests and the interests of the people, and treat both ends equally? Or is it to take care of national interests and the interests of the people, and put personal interests below national interests and the interests of the people? This is a sharp question. The essence of this question is the choice between capitalism and socialism. Is it to adhere to capitalism? Or is it to waver and hesitate between capitalism and socialism? Or is it to lean to the side of socialism? Thinking for the country and the people is also thinking for the future of the industrial and commercial businessmen themselves. We hope that the industrial and commercial businessmen will make a wise choice, that is, to take care of the national interests and the interests of the people, and lean to the side of socialism.

    Our country wants to change its poor and blank state. The experience of the past ten years proves that it is impossible to succeed without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results formulated and promoted by the Party and Chairman Mao is the bright future that illuminates and leads us towards a socialist country that is rich and strong and where individuals obtain complete happiness. If we want to achieve the goal of "taking care of one end" and "leaning to one side," first of all, we must do: wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party. Resolutely rely on the Party, love the Party, unconditionally listen to Chairman Mao's words, and accept the Party's leadership, this is the fundamental of the fundamental, the core of the core; secondly, we must continue to work hard to carry out fundamental reforms in political stance and ideological understanding. The bourgeois essence, the dual political attitude, and the ideological consciousness that everything starts from personal interests that still objectively exist as mentioned above are all non-socialist things. We must resolutely reform them and completely eradicate them. We must break down the capitalist things in order to establish feelings for socialist enterprises and work, and then we can talk about developing a love for the socialist cause, and then we will truly humbly learn from the working class, and take the heroic deeds of the Makou Incident as our own mirror and learn from them. We must defeat putting "me" first in order to work selflessly. Without these fundamental reforms, there will be no conditions and basis to serve socialism. Past facts have proved that since our all-industry joint venture, especially after the Great Leap Forward, our industrial and commercial businessmen have been able to truly do a little more work and make some achievements for socialism because they have accepted socialist transformation. But the past achievements are only the beginning, and they are far from enough, and we need to continue to work hard. We must follow the instructions of Chairman Liu and other leaders, wholeheartedly serve socialism, and participate in the great ranks of socialist construction. We must go further, continue to make greater achievements, and make more contributions.

    Guangdong's goal this year is to increase grain from 32 billion jin last year to 40 billion jin. To this end, we must respond to the Party's call and do everything possible to complete this huge task. First of all, the key to the rapid development of agriculture at present lies in the technical transformation of agriculture, and it requires the rapid development of industry, especially heavy industry, to equip agriculture, and to support agriculture with industry, and to implement the central policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and combining rapid development of agriculture. At the same time, we must also strengthen transportation work to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national economy, and carry out a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "four modernizations". Only in this way can we achieve the arduous task of rapidly developing industry and agriculture and the target tasks of the national economic plan this year. To this end, our industrial and commercial businessmen throughout the province must resolutely join the ranks of the "four modernizations" movement, use their brains more in their own enterprises and work posts, find tricks, and think of various ways to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and do everything possible to drill into business, seize weak links, attack production key points, use local methods and combine local and foreign methods, change the backwardness of manual operation, and march towards the "four modernizations" to improve labor productivity, reduce and save labor force, and carry out the production increase and economy practice movement more widely and deeply, so as to achieve the target set by the Provincial Party Committee that the "four modernizations" will account for 70% before July this year. Second, we must eliminate ideological obstacles and promote the spirit of daring to think and dare to do; establish the idea of everything for socialism, put national interests above personal interests, and start from doing a good job in the enterprise post; we must overcome inferiority; in the process of technical innovation and technical revolution, we must combine with the workers, follow the mass line, humbly learn from the working class, tap our own potential, and selflessly and contribute all our strength. Third, the movement to organize the people's economic life that is currently being carried out in cities is another major change in production relations from individualism to collectivism, and it is also a transition from bourgeois life to socialist life, which will promote our industrial and commercial businessmen and their families to jump out of the small family circle and move towards the socialist family. This will further facilitate the rapid development of the socialist cause. Of the thousands of tasks in urban street work, organizing street residents to participate in and develop production is the first. Liberated family huge labor force participates in the ranks of socialist construction, providing favorable conditions for developing industry and supporting agriculture. Our industrial and commercial businessmen and their families must resolutely support and actively support this measure, and personally promote their families to participate in canteens, nurseries and street-run industries and other production and welfare undertakings, play their role, and contribute all their strength. Fourth, this year is the first year of the 1960s. We must completely change China's backward face. This year's continued hard work is a decisive year for accelerating socialist construction. We must earnestly and diligently do our own job and seriously carry out self-education and self-reform in labor practice in order to further change the political situation and ideological outlook of our industrial and commercial businessmen and their families, and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers who meet the six political standards. Strive to complete the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and strive to realize the national economic plan for 1960. The current domestic and foreign situation is very favorable for our people throughout the country to develop the national economy with the highest speed and comprehensively. The soaring enthusiasm, selfless labor, and excellent qualities of the working class greatly encourage our industrial and commercial businessmen. We can never be satisfied with the current situation of industrial and commercial businessmen. We industrial and commercial businessmen must transform our gratitude to the Party into strength, resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, implement the Party's policies, raise our awareness, go all out, better invest in the production increase and economy practice movement, better carry out political and ideological reform, and contribute our strength and make achievements in the Great Leap Forward. Fifth, the spirit of the representative congress of the National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce this year and the instructions of the head reports must be earnestly implemented in every industrial and commercial businessman and their families, so that everyone knows it, it penetrates deeply into people's hearts, and they quickly take action, and under the specific leadership of the Party committees at all levels, set off a climax of further accepting reform and more actively serving socialist construction.

    工商业者要坚决靠拢党，努力自我改造，一心一意为社会主义服务！
    郭棣活　邓文钊　黄洁　陈秋安代表谈广东工商业者的思想改造主席团、各位同志：
    共产主义大协作精神对工商业者
      是一场现实的社会主义教育
    我们完全同意李富春副总理的国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理的国家决算和预算的报告，并且一定要坚决贯彻执行，为它的彻底实现而努力奋斗。
    我们的国家在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，在1959年又取得了更大的跃进和更为辉煌的胜利。以史无前例的飞跃发展的速度，提前三年，即以二年的时间，超额完成了国家第二个五年计划的任务，这是一个震惊中外的成就。由于有了这样光辉的成就，就让我们可以腾出手来在今后把第二个五年计划剩下的三年时间来做更多的工作。可以肯定，今后三年（1960至1962）必将在过去获得成就的基础上，是一个持续跃进和更加高速度发展的三年。我们有毛主席和中国共产党的领导，有全国六亿五千万人民的努力，有以苏联为首的社会主义国家的支持和帮助，我们充满了信心和决心，一定要在总路线，大跃进，人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下根据我们新的规划胜利前进，并且要取得同样的和更为伟大的成就。但是，我们的国家虽然经过十年来的经济建设，却还未能彻底改变贫穷落后的面貌，为此，我们必须继续努力，逐步把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。要实现这一伟大任务，必须遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，进一步贯彻执行“以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业同时并举的方针”。这是一个完整的、经过历史无数事实考验的社会主义建设的方针，是党中央和毛主席对我国十年来特别是1958年的大跃进和1959年的持续跃进的经验总结，是马克思列宁主义在中国创造性的运用和发展。
    为了要迅速发展农业，在我们广东正在轰轰烈烈地开展一个机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化（简称四化）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，以加速农业的技术改造，并要求迅速发展工业、特别是重工业，以支援农业。现在，全省的工人、农民和其他劳动人民，都在响应党和毛主席的伟大号召，并在这光辉的旗帜下向“四化”进军，忘我劳动奋勇前进！同时，广东各地在崇高的共产主义风格影响下，已经出现了为数众多的为社会主义建设而不顾一切的英雄模范人物。最近广东英德县的“马口事件”的救火英雄们的光辉事迹，就是一个鲜明的典范。当英德县马口造纸厂发生火灾的时候，马口硫铁矿的公安干部和民警，为了抢救国家财产，为了献身国家利益，而奋不顾身的冲进浓烟烈火中去，当火灾扑灭的时候，柴油突然爆炸，不幸有十二位同志英勇牺牲，二十九个同志受伤。马口公安干部和民警这种英勇事迹，是为献身国家利益创造了一个光辉的范例。全国各地闻讯，又在为支援和抢救他们被烧伤了的阶级弟兄，不顾一切地投进了这一伟大的抢救行列中去，并且又出现了许多可歌可泣的英雄人物。一个崭新的人与人的关系树立了，共产主义大协作的精神发扬了，作为一个工商业者的我们，听见了这许多英雄事迹和看见了许多动人的场面，内心在燃烧、在感动！这种活生生的事实对我们是一场现实的社会主义教育。有了这种英雄人物，共产主义风格和共产主义大协作的精神，我们的社会主义建设事业一定能够高速度的发展，一定能够无往而不利和取得更为巨大的成就。
    “大有进步，还要改造”的估价充分反映了工商业者客观上存在的政治思想状况
    在国家的大好形势鼓舞和推动下，在工人阶级的共产主义风格、大协作的精神教育和影响下，我们工商业者又是一种什么情况，将采取什么态度呢？
    反右整风以后，一年多来，广东工商业者在党的领导、教育和工人群众的帮助下，在接受社会主义改造和积极参加社会主义建设方面前后对比，已经有了很大的进步。认识到党的领导的重要性，向党靠拢了一步；与职工群众一起劳动或参加工商界举办的农场锻炼，有一定的表现，逐步改变着对劳动人民的观感和态度；在企业的技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，取得成绩，有所贡献。根据我们了解江门市二十三个工厂、企业的七百五十一个工商业者的统计，1958年共有先进生产（工作）者（包括一、二、三等）一百八十六人次；1959年增到三百一十六人次。海口市一位工商业者郑德彩自1956年合营以来至1959年底的四年中每年每季都评上了先进生产者，并且其中有十四次评为一等，其他为二、三等。这是一个最突出的事例。在今年正在开展的“四化”运动中，全省工商业者一般都在自己的工作岗位上，在党委的直接领导下，投身到这一运动的行列中去，不少人还能够夜以继日地苦战，有些还结合“四化”订了规划，在“五一”、“七一”前要求提出二至三条改革。这些事实说明了广东工商业者已经从轻视劳动转变到参加劳动实践中去，在向着劳动人民学习，开始向着劳动人民过渡，这是一个巨大的转变。但是，这还仅仅是一个开端，而与有着共产主义风格的像马口事件的英雄们比较起来又相距还差十万八千里。一般工商业者由于两面性还存在，资产阶级的本质还没有完全改变，因此反映在去年对总路线、大跃进、人民公社有怀疑抵触和不满，而广东地邻港澳，还要随时受着外来的资本主义思想影响，因而广东工商界思想的反复性和时冷时热的变化情况，比之全国一般工商业者更为显著。在当前的“四化”运动中我们重点调查了江门市的一些工商界的表现，反映在百货行业中就存在着“八不、六怕”的思想。所谓八不是：（1）无钱不行，（2）无技术不行，（3）工厂能行门市部不行，（4）大部门能行小部门不行，（5）无原料不行，（6）洋法行，土法不行，（7）无设备不行，（8）无马达不行。所谓六怕：（1）怕影响指标任务，（2）怕浪费金钱，（3）怕原料不能解决，（4）怕领导不支持，（5）怕安排不好，（6）怕辛苦不愿提。这些情况，无疑是资产阶级的思想反映。再从其他行业或者其他市县看，一般以为“四化”是技工的事与自己无关，大都采取漠不关心的态度；有些希望买现成的，或者要求洋货进口；有些看工人搞、随大流，自己也勉强搞，还没有置身于运动之中，推一推、动一动；有些怀着过关的思想，自己是组长或技术人员不搞不好看，提出一件敷衍了事；有些希望一鸣惊人，失败了又灰心丧气，如梅县畜牧场一私方试验鸡的人工孵化，在一、二次试验中失败了，非常惊慌怕受处分，要求自愿赔偿损失，后来在党的关怀鼓励下卒之成功了，才认识到党的伟大，自己计较个人利害得失的渺小。这些情况又说明工商业者在大有进步的同时，还存在着不少问题。尽管参加了社会主义建设工作，其中的一些人，或者为数不少的人的动摇观望还存在，对社会主义企业就不会有感情，并且另一方面还要留恋着资本主义。如梅县有人所谓“新恩虽厚，旧谊难忘”，其他一些地方也有人说：“对社会主义有向往之心，对资本主义有留恋之意”，正强烈地反映了这种两面性。因此，这种对待社会主义的感情，与马口事件的英雄们，和许许多多的忘我劳动的工人阶级弟兄们比较起来相差不是十万八千里吗？一个是有忘我的精神，冲天的干劲，必要时为了国家利益，为了挽救阶级弟兄可以牺牲自己的生命，而我们中的一些人却还在十字街头徘徊徬徨。从这些情况看来，我们真正向工人阶级过渡，还要继续不断的努力，进行政治立场和思想认识的根本改造，才能够真正赶上形势发展的要求。从这些情况也证明，民建会、工商联两会代表大会对当前工商业者所作的“大有进步，还要改造”的估价，是充分反映了工商业者客观上存在的政治思想状况，是完全正确的。要做到真正为社会主义事业积极服务，
          必须不再“我”字当头
    我们工商业者还有一种情况是，遇事把个人利益摆在国家利益之上，“我”字当头，一切从个人利害得失出发。这是与社会主义集体主义，完全不相容的。从“四化”的技术革新、技术革命运动来看，如上所说的许多事例都是“我”字当头的表现。工商业者要做到真正为社会主义事业积极服务，必须从根本上改变这个两面性，要清除消极落后的资本主义的一面，成为完完全全的社会主义的一面；要丢掉“我”字当头，改为政治挂帅。在民建，工商联代表大会期间刘主席对我们说过，要我们“顾一头、一边倒”，顾国家利益、集体利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。就是针对我们工商业者当前政治思想状况对症下药。人民日报社论也说得好，“顾一头”“一边倒”——这是当前工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造的关键问题，在社会主义改造过程中，每一个工商业者不可避免地要面对个人利益和人民利益的关系问题。是一心顾个人利益而不顾国家利益和人民利益呢？或者是既顾个人利益又顾国家利益和人民利益，两头都顾，等量齐观呢？还是一心顾国家利益和人民利益，而把个人利益放在国家利益和人民利益之下呢？这是一个尖锐的问题。这个问题的实质，是在资本主义和社会主义之间的抉择问题。是坚持资本主义呢？或者是资本主义和社会主义之间摇摇摆摆，三心二意呢？还是倒向社会主义这一边呢？为国家和人民着想，同时也是为工商业者本人的前途着想，我们希望工商业者作出明智的抉择，这就是一心顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。
    我们的国家要改变一穷二白的面貌，从过去十年的经验证明，没有中国共产党和毛主席的领导是根本不可能成功的。党和毛主席制订的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，就是照耀和带领我们走向国家富强、个人获得美满幸福的社会主义的光明前途。我们要达到“顾一头”，“一边倒”的目的，首先，就必须做到：一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟着共产党走。坚决依靠党，热爱党，无条件听毛主席的话，接受党的领导，这就是根本的根本，核心的核心；其次，还要继续努力进行政治立场和思想认识的根本改造，客观上还存在着的如上所述的资产阶级本质的东西，两面性的政治态度，一切从个人利益出发的思想意识，都是非社会主义的东西，必须坚决进行改造，彻底把它铲除，要大破才能大立，破掉资本主义东西，才能建立对社会主义企业和工作的感情，才能说得上产生对社会主义事业的热爱，才会真正虚心向工人阶级学习，把马口英雄事迹作为自己的一面镜子，学习的榜样。要把我字当头打垮，才能忘我劳动。不进行这些根本的改造，就没有条件和基础来为社会主义服务。过去的事实证明，我们在全行业合营以来，特别是大跃进以后，我们工商业者由于接受了社会主义改造，才能够真正地为社会主义多做一点工作，做出一些成绩。但是过去的成绩，还仅仅是开端，还远远不够，还需要继续努力。我们要遵照刘主席和其他首长的指示，一心一意为社会主义服务，参加到社会主义建设事业的伟大行列中去。百尺竿头更进一步，继续做出更大的成绩，作出更多的贡献。
    我们广东要把今年的粮食在去年的三百二十亿斤的基础上增加到四百亿斤的指标。为此，我们必须响应党的号召，千方百计来完成这一巨大任务，首先，当前要求农业的迅速发展，关键在于农业的技术改造，要求工业特别是重工业的迅速发展来装备农业，以工业支援农业，贯彻中央的以农业为基础、以工业为主导、优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针。与此同时，还要加强交通运输工作，以适应国民经济高速度发展的需要，开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。这样才能够达到迅速发展工农业的艰巨任务和今年国民经济计划的指标任务。为此，我们全省工商业者必须坚决投身到“四化”运动的行列中去，在自己的企业和工作岗位上多动脑筋，找窍门，想尽种种办法来进行技术革新、技术革命，千方百计钻进业务中去，抓薄弱环节，攻生产关键，土法上马、土洋并举，改变手工操作的落后面貌，向“四化”进军，以提高劳动生产率，减轻和节约劳动力，把增产节约运动更广泛更深入地开展下去，达到省委规定的在今年7月以前“四化”程度占70％的指标。第二，要清除思想障碍，发扬敢想敢干的精神；树立一切为了社会主义的思想，把国家利益摆在个人利益之上，一切从搞好企业岗位工作出发，要克服自卑感；在技术革新、技术革命过程中，必须与工人结合，走群众路线，虚心向工人阶级学习，发掘自己的潜力，忘我地并且做到不顾一切地贡献自己的所有力量。第三，当前正在城市中开展的组织人民经济生活的运动，又是一个由个人主义走向集体主义的一个生产关系大变革运动，也是一个由资产阶级生活转变到社会主义生活的过渡，这将推动我们工商业者和家属跳出家庭小圈子，走向社会主义大家庭的巨大转变。这将进一步有利于社会主义事业的迅速发展。在城市街道工作中千条万条，组织街道居民参加和发展生产是第一条。解放了的家庭庞大劳动力参加到社会主义建设事业的行列中来，为发展工业支援农业，又提供有利的条件。我们工商业者和家属必须坚决支持和积极拥护这一措施，并身体力行推动家人都参加到食堂、托儿所和街办工业等等生产、福利事业中去，发挥自己的作用，贡献自己一切力量。第四，今年是六十年代的第一年，我们要彻底改变中国落后面貌，今年的继续苦战，对于加速社会主义建设是具有决定性的一年，必须扎扎实实努力做好自己的岗位工作，并在劳动实践中认真进行自我教育和自我改造，为进一步改变我们工商业者和家属的政治状况和思想面貌，把自己改造成为符合于六项政治标准的自食其力的劳动者。为争取提前和超额完成全国农业发展纲要，为实现1960年的国民经济计划而努力奋斗。现在国内和国外的形势对我们全国人民以最高速度、全面地、发展国民经济是很有利的，工人阶级的干劲冲天，忘我劳动，优良品质，都大大鼓舞着我们工商业者。我们绝不可能满足于工商业者的现状。我们工商业者要把对党的感激的心情化为力量，坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，在总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻党的方针、政策，提高觉悟，鼓足干劲，更好地投入增产节约运动，更好地进行政治思想改造，在大跃进中贡献力量，作出成绩。第五，民建中央、全国工商联今年的代表大会的会议精神和首长报告的指示，必须认真贯彻到每一个工商业者和家属中去，使家喻户晓，深入人心，并迅速行动起来，在各级党委的具体领导下，掀起一个为进一步接受改造，更积极地为社会主义建设服务的高潮。
