Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 4th: The Cambodian National Assembly, in its special session held today, unanimously passed amendments to the clauses in the Cambodian Constitution regarding the election of a new king and the issue of regency.

    The original constitution stipulated that the Supreme Royal Council should convene a meeting within three days of the throne becoming vacant to elect a new king, and elect a regent when the new king is a minor. The amended constitution stipulates that if, due to national affairs, the circumstances do not allow for the election of a new king, a Regency Council shall be elected to temporarily exercise the prerogatives of the king. The Regency Council shall be composed of three members, and the chairman must be a member of the royal family. The Regency Council shall make decisions with the unanimous approval of all members, and all decrees requiring the king's approval must be signed by all members.

    柬埔寨修改宪法中关于选举新国王的条款
    据新华社金边4日电　柬埔寨国民议会今天举行的非常会议一致通过修改柬埔寨宪法中关于选举新国王和摄政问题的条款。
    原宪法规定，最高皇庭会议应该在王位空悬的三天内召开会议，选出新国王，在新国王未成年时，选出摄政。修改后的宪法规定，如果由于国事的原因，环境不允许选出新国王时，就选出摄政会议暂时负责行使国王的特权。摄政会议由三人组成，主席必须为王室成员。摄政会议由全体成员一致通过作出决定，需要国王批准的一切法令必须由全体成员签署。
