The representatives will discuss the developments since the First Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, which closed in Cairo on January 1, 1958, and formulate future tasks for the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle. The conference agenda includes: (1) Completely eradicating imperialism and colonialism in Asia and Africa. This issue will include independence, African and Afro-Asian solidarity, peaceful coexistence, disarmament, and other content. (2) Issues of economic development in Asia and Africa. (3) Issues of cultural and social development in Asia and Africa. (4) The development of the Afro-Asian solidarity movement. The slogan of this conference is: "Oppose imperialism and colonialism, strive for independence, equality, and peace."

It is reported that the conference will open on the morning of the 11th with an opening speech by the President of the Republic of Guinea, Sékou Touré. Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, will deliver a political report to the conference.

Colored flags are hung on the streets to welcome representatives from various countries. Banners with the conference emblem (two hands clasped together, with a torch on the map of Asia and Africa) and the conference slogan are posted throughout the city.

The first press communique issued by the permanent secretariat of the conference stated that the peoples of Asia and Africa believe that imperialist rule, foreign exploitation, and the evils arising from the oppression of the people deprive people of basic rights, violate the United Nations Charter, and are thus detrimental to peaceful development and international cooperation. The new era does not allow the continued existence of imperialism. The peoples of Asia and Africa are convinced that all nations enjoy the right to freedom and independence.
