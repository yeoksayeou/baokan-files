Zhengzhou No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Mill's workers creatively reformed electric motors, increasing the power output of the motors and using one motor to drive two looms. The whole factory's weaving workshop saved 1,218 electric motors and an equal number of switches.

After the original electric motor, which drove one loom, was changed to drive two looms, it not only did not affect production, but also had many benefits. Because the electrical capacity increased and the current relatively decreased, the lifespan of the electric motor was extended, the electrical peak load during startup and the downtime caused by switch fuse explosions were reduced, electricity was saved, efficiency was improved, and output was increased. It also prevented the phenomenon of damaging shuttles and machine parts.

    一台机器当两台用
    郑州国棉三厂职工创造性地改革电动机，提高电动机的出力，用一台电动机带动两台织布机，全厂织布车间节省出一千二百一十八台电动机和同等数量的开关。
    原来带动一台布机的电动机改为带动两台布机后，不但不影响生产，而且有许多好处。由于电容量增加，电流相对减少，从而延长了电动机寿命，减少起动时造成的电气高峰负荷和开关铅丝爆炸造成的停台，节约了用电，提高了效率，增加了产量，还可以杜绝轧坏梭子和机件的现象。
