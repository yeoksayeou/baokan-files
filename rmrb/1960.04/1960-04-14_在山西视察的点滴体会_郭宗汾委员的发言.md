Some Experiences from Inspecting Shanxi
Speech by Committee Member Guo Zongfen

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 draft national budget. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the three magic weapons for the entire period of socialist construction in our country, and they are the product of Mao Zedong Thought." This is completely correct. Before coming to Beijing to attend the meeting, I inspected ten large and small factories in Taiyuan City, and visited several people's communes in the Jinan Special District, Jishan County, and Houma City. From these actual inspections, I have further confirmed that "Comrade Mao Zedong, in the process of socialist construction, as in the process of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, creatively applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, formulated the party's general line and related set of policies, and enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism."

Taiyuan is rapidly growing into a promising industrial base

First, I will talk about the situation in Taiyuan during my inspection. Although there were some factories in Taiyuan before liberation, the products of these factories were negligible. Because the reactionary ruling class served imperialism, it was of no benefit to the people. After liberation, the people took control of the political power, and these factories returned to the hands of the people, so the situation was naturally different. Especially after the promulgation of the General Line, the continuous Great Leap Forward situation of 1958 and 1959 emerged, and the factories in Taiyuan grew like mushrooms after a spring rain. Not only did the quantity increase, but also the quality greatly improved due to the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements. Many projects have climbed to the peak of science. The "three-furnace steelmaking" we saw at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company is a world-famous innovation. The Jinxi Heavy Machinery Plant manufactured some large forgings, which are also rare in the world. This shows that our working class, closely relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to the Party's mass line, going all out, aiming high, and achieved many things that our predecessors dared not even think of. Some small and medium-sized factories, such as the phosphate fertilizer factory, the plastics factory, and the carbon factory that has just been put into production, etc., are all started with indigenous methods, evolving from indigenous to foreign, fully demonstrating the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, self-reliance, and giving full play to the advantages that large factories cannot easily give play to. The products are not only excellent, but also low in cost. The spirit of mutual cooperation among the factories is even more admirable. The establishment of each new factory is mostly due to the strong support of the old factories, regardless of manpower and materials. Therefore, some factories were established in tens of hours, such as the wire factory, the ball bearing factory, etc., striving for every second to electrify and axle the vehicles, contributing their strength for the overall needs. Large factories treat small factories like this, and small factories treat large factories like this too. For example, the nitrogen fertilizer factory, which is about to be put into production soon, is fully equipped with modern equipment and has a large construction force. However, in order to make its products available for topdressing wheat this year, the small factories have also transferred forces to support it, so that the nitrogen fertilizer factory can be put into production ahead of schedule. This spirit of communist collaboration has become a common moral style of the factories. Without the glorious light of the General Line, and without a set of two-legged walking policies, such a high-speed production and construction is unimaginable. The factories in Taiyuan City embody the spirit of the General Line, embody the spirit of basing on the development of agriculture, and are now rapidly growing into an industrial base with great prospects.

The People's Commune has become the most beloved form of organization in the minds of the working people

We also inspected the Jinci Town People's Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, the Zhaidian People's Commune and the Fancun People's Commune in Jishan County, Jinan Special District, and the Qucun People's Commune in Houma City. Judging from the situation of these people's communes, production has been significantly improved due to the liberation of productive forces, especially the liberation of women's productive forces. With the increase of production, living conditions have also been greatly improved. Public welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, medical stations, cultural and sports activities, etc. have all had a good foundation. Taking the Taiyangcun Management Area of the Zhaidian People's Commune as an example, it used to be a small village with more than 200 households and more than 1,000 people, which was extremely poor. More than 80% of the people lacked food. The working people worked for the landlords, working hard all year round, but they could not get enough to eat, let alone pay attention to hygiene and all activities of sports and entertainment. Whenever epidemics broke out, they infected each other, resulting in a large number of deaths. It was really a miserable life. After liberation, after the land reform, the working people became masters of their own affairs, from mutual aid teams to cooperatives, from advanced cooperatives to people's communes, production continued to increase, and living conditions continued to improve. In 1952, the opposition to the US imperialism's use of germ warfare in Korea set off a large-scale patriotic health movement. This movement was closely integrated with production, closely relying on the leadership of the Party, and the working people gave full play to their collective wisdom, putting forward twenty-nine kinds of manure accumulation methods such as "seven sweeps", "eight digs", and "fourteen removals". The deeper the patriotic health movement, the greater the increase in production. In the past, the annual yield of wheat per mu was only 60 jin, but now it has reached 200 to 300 jin. The poor village where 80% of the people lacked food in the past has also become a rich village today where every family has surplus grain, every household has savings, and people have ample food and clothing. 60% of the families have bicycles, and last year they also sold 160,000 jin of grain to the state to support the disaster areas. It is really a remarkable change in such a village. Since the national on-site meeting on health work was held here last November, Shanxi has also put forward the slogan of learning from Taiyang and catching up with Taiyang, which has given them a great impetus. Since health work is combined with production, and the increase in production guarantees health work and other tasks, culture and entertainment, and sports have also achieved great results. When we went to inspect in mid-March, Taiyang Village had received more than 36,000 visiting groups from all over the country, and there are still continuous calls to book dates. Their community-run industry and sideline production are also very successful. The whole community has nine factories, and has now fully realized mechanization and semi-mechanization. Most of the daily necessities have been self-sufficient, especially creating a lot of tools for agricultural machinery, saving labor and greatly increasing production. Their community-run economy, including sideline production, has been very considerable. Taiyang Village now has eight tractors, and this year it wants to buy another one. The other management areas of the same community also have their own characteristics. For example, the canteen in Xiewei Village can provide meals for 60 people per person, and ensure that they eat hot meals, which the commune members are very satisfied with. The cultural and sports activities in the Wudui Management Area are very well managed. Wudui has popularized higher primary education, and is now engaged in the popularization of junior high school education. I looked at their exhibition room, and the poems and articles have rich content and emotions. Old people in their eighties compose and perform themselves, participating in literary performances, which adds more vitality to the literary performances. Sports activities have become an indispensable part of the daily life of the commune members. Twenty-seven women in their fifties and sixties have been practicing Taijiquan collectively for a long time. In short, all their work has been praised by everyone who has been here. The main reason why they have achieved these achievements is the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. The cadres here can also take politics as the commander and embody the Party's policies, so the people's commune has become the most beloved form of organization in the minds of the working people. Now they are moving towards a higher stage, and they are carrying out the "high-yield plot" movement everywhere.

The People's Commune will make the high-yield plot movement bear more fruitful results

The "high-yield plot", also called fangtian (square field), is caused by gardening, but its content is richer than gardening. It can completely eliminate the remnants of private ownership, connect small plots of land into large areas, some are tens of thousands of mu, and some are tens of thousands of mu or several thousand mu, etc. There are also medium and small squares in the large square to facilitate production. They put forward the slogan of "building teams with squares" to make the organization of the production team adapt to the needs of the square field and make the relations of production adapt to the development of productive forces. This is the preparation work for agricultural mechanization and scientification. A command post is set up in the middle of the "high-yield plot", with the secretary taking the lead as the commander, and two excellent production team leaders are selected as deputy commanders to jointly direct production. There are four offices: responsible for weather forecast, soil improvement, seed selection and breeding, economic accounting, financial management, etc. In fact, it is equivalent to a small agricultural scientific research institution and learning institution. They plant according to the geology, what is suitable to plant, and the team members also give full play to their active factors according to their strengths. In the future, agriculture will become factory-style production, output will be greatly increased, and production tools will be rapidly improved. In order to manage crops and understand the growth of crops, a garden of one-five thousandth the size is opened near the command post, and crops are planted at the same time as the crops in the big square in proportion, so that they can be observed without having to run to various places every day. The commune members call it a geomorphic map. In addition, experimental fields for cadres should also be reserved to facilitate demonstration for commune members. The command post also has new-type roads leading to all directions, and afforestation along the road has been successful. We felt that this is a beautiful picture of a socialist and communist society, drawing an infinitely beautiful prospect. However, we sincerely support such new things, while the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements deliberately sabotage them. When we were carrying out fangtian work in the Beifangping Management Area of the Fancun People's Commune in Jishan County, some people secretly buried the boundary stones on his original land boundary, making his plans, but the people's awareness has been greatly improved, and this activity was quickly exposed by the people and must not hinder our great movement in any way. A large-scale movement to establish high-yield plots has been launched in Jishan County, Jinan Special District, and Shanxi Province. The unparalleled superiority of the people's commune will bloom more brilliantly and bear more fruitful results due to the successful completion of this movement.

Fellow committee members, I have not studied enough, my understanding of the issues is not comprehensive, and the inspection time is very short, so there are inevitably omissions. However, from this actual observation, I feel that the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have brought infinite happiness to the people. In the great 1960s, they will also guarantee our continuous leap forward in all aspects, while my own position and world outlook cannot adapt to today's needs. In the future, I should strive to progress under the leadership of the Party and catch up quickly. Finally, I wish the conference a success and the committee members good health.

    在山西视察的点滴体会
    郭宗汾委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我对于陈叔通副主席第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告、李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，表示完全同意并衷心地拥护。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国整个社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物。”这是完全正确的。我在来北京参加会议以前，曾在太原市视察了十个大小类型不同的工厂，并到晋南专区的、稷山县、侯马市，看了几个人民公社，从这些实际视察中，更进一步证明“毛泽东同志在社会主义建设过程中，同在民主革命和社会主义革命过程中一样，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，制定了党的总路线和有关的一套方针，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。”
    太原正在迅速成长为一个很有前途的工业基地
    我首先谈一谈在太原视察的情形。太原在解放以前虽然有一些工厂，但是这些工厂的产品是微不足道的，由于反动统治阶级是为帝国主义服务，对人民没有一点好处。解放以后，人民掌握了政权，这些工厂回到人民手中，情况当然不同了，特别在总路线公布以后，出现了1958年和1959年连续大跃进的局面，太原的工厂像雨后春笋般的成长起来，不但数量增多，而且由于技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，质量上也大大的提高，有不少的项目，攀登了科学的高峰。我们在太原钢铁公司看到的“三槽出钢”就是世界闻名的创举。晋西重型机器厂制造了一些大型锻件，也是世界上所少有的，这说明了我们的工人阶级，紧紧的依靠着党的领导，坚持党的群众路线，鼓足干劲、力争上游，干出了很多前人想都不敢想的事。又有些中小型的工厂，如磷肥厂、塑料厂以及刚刚投入生产的碳素厂等，都是土法上马，由土生洋，充分表现了勤俭办企业的精神，自力更生，发挥了大厂所不易发挥的优越性，是以产品不但能达到精良，而且成本也是低廉的。各厂相互间协作的精神，更值得钦佩，每一新厂的建立，多是由老厂的大力支援，人力物力，在所不计，所以有的是在几十个小时以内建立起来的，如线材厂，滚珠轴承厂等，为了电气化，为了车辆的轴承化，争取分秒的时间，为整体的需要而贡献他们的力量，大厂对小厂如此，小厂对大厂也是这样，如最近即将投入生产的氮肥厂，设备完全是现代化的，建筑力量也很大，但是为了使它的产品能供给今年小麦追肥使用，各小厂也都抽调力量来支援，使氮肥厂能提前投入生产，这种共产主义大协作的精神，已成为各工厂共同的道德作风，如果没有总路线的光辉照耀，没有一套两条腿走路的方针，这样高速度的生产建设，是不可能设想的。太原市各厂体现了总路线的精神，体现了以发展农业为基础的精神，现在正迅速地成长为一个很有远大前途的工业基地。
    人民公社已成为劳动人民心目中最可爱的组织形式
    我们还视察了太原市郊区的晋祠镇人民公社，晋南专区稷山县的翟店人民公社，樊村人民公社，以及侯马市的曲村人民公社。从这几个人民公社的情况来看，由于生产力的解放，尤其是妇女生产力的解放，生产均有显著的提高，生产提高了生活也有很大的改善，公共福利事业如食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、医疗站、文娱体育活动等均有了很好的基础，单就翟店人民公社太阳村管理区来说，过去是一个二百多户，一千来人的小村，穷苦不堪，80％以上的人缺粮吃，劳动人民为地主干活，辛勤终岁，不得温饱，更谈不到讲求卫生，以及体育文娱的一切活动了，每遇疫症流行，即相互传染，发生大量死亡，真是民不聊生。解放以后，经过了土地改革，劳动人民当家作主，由互助组到合作社，由高级合作社到人民公社，产量不断的提高，生活不断的改善，1952年反对美帝国主义在朝鲜用细菌作战，更掀起了大规模的爱国卫生运动，这一运动紧密的结合了生产，紧紧依靠党的领导，劳动人民发挥了他们的集体智慧，提出了“七扫”“八挖”“十四清除”的二十九种积肥办法，爱国卫生运动愈深入，增产的幅度越大，过去每亩不过年产小麦六十斤，现在已能达到二、三百斤，过去80％的人缺粮的穷村，也变成为今天家家有余粮、户户有存款、丰衣足食的富村，60％的人家有了自行车，去年还卖给国家十六万斤粮食以支援灾区，在这样的村子里真是一个了不起的变化。自从去年11月全国在这里开了卫生工作现场会议以后，山西也提出了学太阳、赶太阳的口号，又给了他们很大的促动力。由于卫生工作结合了生产，生产提高又保证了卫生工作以及其他各项工作，文娱、体育也取得了很大的成绩，我们3月中旬去视察的时候，太阳村已接待了来自全国各地的参观团达三万六千多人，尚连续不断的有人来电预约日期。他们的社办工业和副业也很有成绩，全社有九个工厂，截至现在已全部实现了机械化半机械化，一切生活必需品已大部自给，特别是为农业机械创造了不少工具，节约了劳动力，又大大地增加了生产，他们的社办经济包括副业已很有可观，太阳村现有八台拖拉机，今年还想再购买一台。同社的另外几个管理区也各有各的特点，比如西位村的食堂一个人可以供六十人的伙食，而且保证吃热饭，社员感到非常满意。坞堆管理区文娱、体育办理非常好。坞堆已普及了高小教育，现正搞初中普及教育。我看了他们的展览室，诗文都有丰富的内容和情感，八十岁的老人自编自演，参加文艺演出，为文艺演出更增加了活力。体育活动成了社员们日常生活中不可缺少的项目，二十七名五六十岁的妇女集体练太极拳，已坚持了很久。总之他们的一切工作都已成为到过这里的人们所同声称赞的了。他们所以取得这些成就的主要原因，是人民公社的无比优越性带来的，而这里的干部又能政治挂帅体现了党的方针政策，是以人民公社已成为劳动人民心目中最可爱的组织形式。现在他们正向更高的阶段推进，到处大搞“丰产方”运动。
    人民公社将使丰产方运动结出更丰硕之果
    “丰产方”也叫方田，是由园田化引起的，但它的内容较园田化更丰富了，它可以彻底消灭私有制的遗迹，把小块土地连成大片，有的是双万亩，有的是万亩或几千亩不等，大方之中还有中方小方，以便于生产，他们提出了“以方建队”的口号，使生产队的组织适应方田的需要，使生产关系适应生产力的发展。这是农业机械化、科学化的准备工作。“丰产方”的中间设置指挥台，由书记挂帅担任司令员，另选优秀的生产队长二人为副司令员，共同指挥生产。下设四室：负责气象预告，土壤改良，选种育种，经济核算、财务管理等等工作，实际上相当于一个小型的农业科学研究机构，学习机构。他们按照地质，宜于种什么就种什么，各队队员也按照各人的长处，发挥他们的积极因素，将来将使农业成为工厂式的生产，产量将会大大地增加，生产工具也会迅速的改进。为了管理农作物了解农作物的生长情况，在指挥台附近另辟五千分之一大小的园地，按比例与大方的农作物同时种植，以便观察，不必天天跑到各地方去，社员们把它叫作地貌图。另外也要留干部们的实验田，以便于为社员示范。指挥台还有新型的公路通往四方，路旁绿化已有成绩。我们看了感到这是一幅美丽的社会主义共产主义社会图画，绘出了无限美好的前景。但是这样的新生事物，我们是衷心拥护的而地富反坏分子却来蓄意破坏，稷山县的樊村人民公社北方平管理区就有人在我们进行方田工作时，偷偷地把界石埋在他原来的地界上，作他的打算，但是人民的觉悟大大地提高了，这种活动很快的为人民所识破，而加以揭发，决不能对我们这一伟大运动加以任何阻碍。在稷山县、在晋南专区、在山西全省已展开大规模的建立丰产方运动，人民公社的无比优越性将会由于这一运动的胜利完成，开出更灿烂之花，结出更丰硕之果来。
    各位委员，我学习的不够，认识问题不全面，视察的时间很短，难免有挂漏之处。但是从这次实际的观察中，感到总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗，已给人民带来了无限的幸福，在伟大的六十年代还会保证我们在一切方面持续跃进，而自己的立场问题，世界观问题尚不能适应今天的需要，今后应当在党的领导之下努力进步，急起直追。最后祝大会胜利，委员同志们身体健康。
