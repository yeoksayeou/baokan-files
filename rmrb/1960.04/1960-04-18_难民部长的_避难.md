    The Refugee Minister's "Asylum"
    Xi Linsheng
    On April 8th, the West German government announced that West German Refugee Minister Oberländer was taking "extended leave."
    Who exactly is this Adenauer minister? Why would he, without illness or dereliction of duty, take "extended leave"?
    If one were to open the West German "Federal Parliament Guide" to page 286 and look at this minister's resume, one would find that his history is quite impressive:
    "Born in Meiningen in 1905. Christian. University professor.
    "1928-1930, studied economics in Berlin and Königsberg. 1930-1932, postgraduate in agricultural economics, doctorate in political science, doctorate in agricultural science, traveled to the Soviet Union, Canada, and the United States to study agriculture. 1933-1940, successively served as lecturer at the University of Königsberg, director of the Danzig Institute for Eastern Economics, full professor at the University of Königsberg, full professor at the University of Greifswald, and professor of public law at the German University of Prague. 1940-1945, served in the military, holding the rank of captain, captured."
    From this refugee minister's series of impressive titles—doctorate, "university professor," director of an institute...—he appears to be a scholar of "both ability and virtue." Although Oberländer had held some official position during the Hitler era, it seems justifiable for Adenauer to employ such a knowledgeable person as a cabinet minister.
    However, unfortunately, another resume of Oberländer's—the Nazi government's archives—was discovered not long ago. This revealed that this refugee minister's background was far more significant than recorded in the West German "Federal Parliament Guide."
    The Nazi archive materials clearly state:
    As early as 1923, Oberländer followed the "Führer" and participated in the Munich-planned riot. In 1933, he joined the Nazi Party, with the number 2331552. In 1934, he was honored as the leader of the "German Eastern Revisionist League." At the time, a Nazi magazine praised him: "Professor Oberländer is a person who has been working on the front lines of the East for many years, and he is an expert on Eastern issues." And Oberländer indeed exerted all his strength in serving the "Führer." He once wrote: "In any case, the political views of the German Eastern Revisionist League should of course consider the policy towards Poland established by the Führer as the only appropriate and necessary one." He also shouted: "Fight for German National Socialism, even at the cost of sacrifice." And Oberländer indeed practiced what he preached. He personally participated in planning espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, and entered the Soviet Union four times to collect political and military intelligence.
    If Oberländer had only engaged in such "secret" espionage activities, it would perhaps still be excusable. The Nazi archives recorded more of his "achievements" during World War II, among which the most "remarkable" are the following:
    In 1940, Oberländer served as the commander and political officer of the Hitler special assault team "Nachtigall Battalion." This assault team, named "Nachtigall" (Nightingale), was actually as fierce as the Nazi coat of arms—the vulture. When the "Nachtigall Battalion" entered the Soviet city of Lviv in June 1941, Oberländer ordered the massacre of three thousand Soviet citizens, Jews, and Poles within a week. Later, in Złoczów and Satanov in Ukraine, the "Nachtigall Battalion" raped and murdered a large number of local people.
    In the second half of October 1942, Oberländer personally killed fifteen Soviet citizens in the Pyatigorsk prison.
    In Kislovodsk, Oberländer ordered a group of severely wounded Soviet soldiers in a hospital to be thrown into the street. When the Hitler bandits retreated, the German army, under his orders, blew up the hospital...
    This "scholar," "professor," was originally a blood-soaked executioner. And this former "meritorious official" of Hitler's is today prospering in his official career thanks to this past, holding an important position as a cabinet minister under the current Prime Minister Adenauer, because Oberländer has indeed lived up to his reputation. Since becoming the Refugee Minister, he has constantly clamored for "conquering the lands east of Germany," "restoring the 1938 borders," and "annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia..." Relying on his old connections in the Nazi Party, Oberländer also single-handedly built twenty-nine militaristic organizations of so-called "compatriot associations." These organizations are fanatically inciting the revanchist sentiment of "fighting back to the East." Oberländer's spirit of "fighting for Hitler's National Socialism" has not diminished in the slightest.
    Precisely because of this, when Oberländer's crimes were exposed, the Adenauer government immediately came out to protect this Nazi element. The West German government solemnly issued a statement, claiming: "According to our understanding, our colleague, Dr. Oberländer, is blameless." We have "full confidence in Mr. Oberländer." Adenauer himself came forward and stated: "I need Oberländer, I need his experience." The statements by the Bonn government and Adenauer are undoubtedly sincere. They are continuing Hitler's unfinished business, so what is there to blame in such a meritorious official? And who could be more trustworthy than him? How could they not need the experience of such a veteran with rich experience in aggression? But the people want to settle Oberländer's blood debt. Mere statements are not enough to exonerate him.
    Therefore, not long ago, the Bonn government painstakingly staged a so-called "international committee" investigation into Oberländer in The Hague, Netherlands. Presiding over this investigation was the notorious and extremely reactionary "Cold War" supporter Van Staal. The witnesses questioned in this investigation were all designated by Oberländer himself, while witnesses from Eastern European countries who had witnessed the truth were refused to provide evidence. And this "investigation" actually came to the conclusion that the "Nachtigall" battalion of Oberländer, who invaded and attacked the Soviet Union, did not fire a single shot or kill a single person when it occupied the city of Lviv; rather, the Soviet army itself massacred the Soviet people. Therefore, before the investigation was even over, this "international committee" hastily declared Oberländer innocent.
    However, such a "verdict" is ineffective in the face of the angry people. The West German public is determined to pursue Oberländer's crimes. Even many bourgeois newspapers, and even within the West German Social Democratic Party and Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Party, there are many people who demand that this minister step down. At the same time, the people of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have also exposed Oberländer's numerous blood debts and demanded that he be punished. The Prosecutor General of the German Democratic Republic has also filed an indictment with the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic, accusing Oberländer of his crimes. The Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing in Berlin on April 20 to have Oberländer appear in court.
    Besieged on all sides, what to do? Adenauer had no choice but to let his "respected" colleague take refuge temporarily. Thus, Oberländer went on "extended leave."
    However, the refugee minister's leave has obviously not brought his affair to an end. Moreover, in the Adenauer government, there is more than one important official whose experience is no less than that of this refugee minister. For example, Interior Minister Schröder was a former member of Hitler's Sturmabteilung. Two four-star generals of the West German armed forces, Speidel and Heusinger, were also once prominent Nazi generals. The "background" of many of them is already well known. The people of West Germany and the people of all countries will never let them go, and sooner or later they will settle their old accounts. And by then, even if they all take a collective "extended leave," they will not be able to escape the judgment of justice. (Attached picture)

    难民部长的“避难”
    席林生
    4月8日，西德政府宣布西德难民部长奥勃兰德尔“长期休假”。
    这位阿登纳的部长究竟何许人也？为什么他一无病患，二无失职，却要“长期休假”呢？
    如果翻开西德“联邦议院指南”第二百八十六页看一下这位部长的简历，会发现其历史是相当堂皇的：
    “1905年生于迈宁根。信奉基督教。大学教授。
    “1928—1930年，在柏林、哥尼斯堡研究经济。1930—1932年，农业经济学研究生，获政治科学博士、农业科学博士，游历苏联、加拿大、美国考察农业。1933—1940年，曾先后受任哥尼斯堡大学讲师、但泽东方经济研究所主任、哥尼斯堡大学专任教授、格来福华大学专任教授、布拉格德国大学公法教授。1940年—1945年，服军役，任陆军上尉，被俘。”
    从这位难民部长一连串显赫的头衔——博士、“大学教授”、研究所主任……来看，他俨然是一位“德才兼备”的学者。虽然奥勃兰德尔在希特勒时代曾当过一官半职，这样一位有学问的人物被阿登纳起用为内阁部长，好像也是未可厚非的。
    但是，不幸的是奥勃兰德尔的另一份履历——纳粹政府的档案，不久以前被人们发现了。这揭露了这位难民部长的来头远比西德“联邦议院指南”所记载的大得多。
    那份纳粹档案材料上写得很明白：
    早在1923年，奥勃兰德尔就追随“元首”参与了在慕尼黑策划的暴动。1933年他加入了纳粹党，编号是二三三一五五二。1934年，他荣任“德国东方复仇主义联盟”的首领。当时一家纳粹杂志这样称颂他：“奥勃兰德尔教授是从事东方第一线工作多年的人，他是有关东方问题方面的专家。”而奥勃兰德尔为“元首”服务确也卖尽力气。他曾经写道：“无论如何，德国东方复仇主义联盟的政治见解当然应该认为元首所创立的对波兰的政策是唯一适当而必要的。”他还叫喊过：“为德国国家社会主义而战，不惜牺牲。”而且奥勃兰德尔的确身体力行。他曾亲自参与策划对苏联和其它东欧国家进行间谍活动和破坏活动，并且四次进入苏联收集政治、军事情报。
    如果奥勃兰德尔仅仅是干过这样一些“暗暗的”间谍活动，那似乎还情有可原。纳粹的档案记载了他在第二次大战中更多的“功绩”，其中最“卓著”的就有如下几桩：
    1940年奥勃兰德尔充任希特勒特种讨伐队“夜莺营”的司令官和政治官员。这支名为“夜莺”的讨伐队实际上像纳粹国徽——兀鹰一样凶恶。当1941年6月“夜莺营”进入苏联利沃城后一个星期，奥勃兰德尔就下令屠杀了三千名苏联公民、犹太人和波兰人。此后到乌克兰的佐洛契夫、萨塔诺夫等地，“夜莺营”又强奸和杀害了大批当地的人民。
    1942年10月下半月，奥勃兰德尔在皮亚季戈尔斯克的监狱中亲自杀害了十五名苏联公民。
    在基斯洛沃德斯克，奥勃兰德尔曾经命令把医院中的一批苏联重伤兵扔到街上。当希特勒匪徒撤退时，德国军队根据他的命令炸毁了这所医院……。
    这位“学者”、“教授”原来是一名血债累累的刽子手。而这个昔日希特勒的“功臣”今天正是凭着这一手官运亨通，在当今总理阿登纳手下担任了内阁部长的要职，因为奥勃兰德尔的确不辱所命，他自从当了难民部长以来，就不断叫嚣“征服德国以东土地”、“恢复1938年疆界”、“吞并奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克”……。凭着他过去在纳粹党里的老关系，奥勃兰德尔还一手建成了二十九个所谓“同乡会”的军国主义组织。这些组织狂热地煽动着“打回东方去”的复仇情绪。奥勃兰德尔为希特勒的“国家社会主义奋斗”的精神不减当年。
    正是因为如此，当奥勃兰德尔的罪行被揭发之后，阿登纳政府马上出来袒护这个纳粹分子。西德政府郑重其事地发表了声明，声称：“根据我们了解，对于我们的同事，奥勃兰德尔博士是无可责备的”。我们“对奥勃兰德尔先生是充分信赖的”。阿登纳还亲自出面表示：“我需要奥勃兰德尔，我需要他的经验。”波恩政府和阿登纳的声明无疑的是出自由衷之言。他们正在继承着希特勒未竟的事业，对于这样一位有功之臣，有什么可以责备的呢？又有什么人比他更可以信赖的呢？怎么会不需要这样一位富有侵略经验的老前辈的经验呢？但是人民却要算奥勃兰德尔的血债。仅仅是两纸声明是不足以替他开脱的。
    于是波恩政府不久以前又煞费苦心地在荷兰海牙搞了一出所谓“国际委员会”对奥勃兰德尔的调查丑剧。主持这次调查的是臭名远扬的极端反动的“冷战”支持者范斯塔尔。这次调查传讯的证人都是奥勃兰德尔自己指定的人，一些目睹真相的东欧国家的证人却被拒绝提供证据。而这次“调查”竟得出这样的结论：侵略和进攻苏联的奥勃兰德尔的“夜莺”营占领利沃夫城时，没有发过一枪一弹，没有杀死一个人；倒是苏联的军队则自己屠杀了苏联的人民。因此，调查还没有结束，这个“国际委员会”就迫不及待地宣布奥勃兰德尔无罪。
    但是，这样的“宣判”，在愤怒的人民面前是毫无效力的。西德的公众坚决要追究奥勃兰德尔的罪行。连许多资产阶级报纸，甚至西德社会民主党以及阿登纳自己的基督教民主党内部，也有不少人要求这位部长下台。同时，苏联和德意志民主共和国人民也纷纷揭发了奥勃兰德尔的累累血债并要求予以惩处。德意志民主共和国检察署长也向德意志民主共和国最高法院提出了起诉状，控告奥勃兰德尔的罪行。最高法院已经定于4月20日在柏林开庭，要奥勃兰德尔出庭受审。
    四面楚歌，怎么办呢？阿登纳不得已，只好让他这位“可尊敬”的同僚暂时避避风。于是奥勃兰德尔就“长期休假”去了。
    然而，难民部长的休假显然并没有能够使他的事情就此结束。况且在阿登纳政府中，不比这位难民部长的经历逊色的重要官员何止一个？譬如内政部长施罗德就是过去希特勒冲锋队队员。西德国防军的两个四星上将斯派达尔和豪辛格也是曾经赫赫一时的纳粹将领。他们许多人的“底”也早为人所共知。西德人民和各国人民是绝对不会放过他们的，迟早要把他们的老账算清。而到那时，他们就是来一个集体的“长期休假”，也是无法逃避正义的裁判的。（附图片）
