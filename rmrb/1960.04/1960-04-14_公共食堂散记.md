Random Notes on Public Canteens		Ye Qingnong	    Four Years of Separation, Now Living Together Again

　　Wu Er'nai's family has thirteen members. The main family members, besides Er'nai's husband Tang Fuxiang, are her eldest son Tang Shitai and daughter-in-law Li Shiying. Shitai spends his days working in the fields, while Shiying shoulders the burden of raising pigs, chickens, growing vegetables, cooking, washing clothes, and taking care of the children. Just these tasks alone are enough to exhaust her every day, let alone squeezing in time to work in the fields. However, Er'nai insists on "nitpicking," either saying that the housework is not well managed or complaining that she doesn't earn enough work points. One day, Shiying came back from work a little late, and as soon as she stepped into the kitchen, she heard Er'nai say: "It seems like no one is taking care of this house. The water jar is so dry it could be used to dry rice. It's getting dark, and the pigs haven't been fed, the chickens haven't been put away, and the children have been clamoring for food for a long time..." Shiying couldn't bear it any longer and said, "Mom, you can't blame me for that!" Er'nai didn't expect her daughter-in-law to talk back to her today, and her anger flared up: "Who else would I blame? I only blame myself; I can't stand living like this. After tonight, the two of us old folks will take a few of the little ones and find another place to live, so as not to be a burden on you." Thus, on August 5, 1954, Er'nai and her daughter-in-law separated.

　　In mid-August 1958, the people here realized communization and also set up canteens. Er'nai's skill in cooking meals was well-known since she was young. As soon as the canteen was established, the commune members elected her as the canteen cook. Shiying's family also ate in the canteen. She has three children, the eight-year-old is already studying at the management district elementary school, the three-year-old is in the production team's nursery class, and the less than one-year-old is cared for by the team's daycare center. Therefore, some housework has been eliminated, and her monthly work attendance rate has increased from ten days in the past to twenty-five or six days. With the increase in attendance rate, income has also increased. In the first two months after the canteen was established, she and Shitai took more than eight yuan from their wages to buy a丈四尺 of blue cloth and sent it to Er'nai. Er'nai said, "Leave it for the grandchildren to make clothes!" Shiying said, "They've already bought clothes for them, this is specially prepared for you, old lady." Er'nai smiled and accepted it. One night, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were studying culture in the dining hall. Suddenly, it started pouring rain, and it kept pouring, which made things difficult for Er'nai. Although the place where she lived was not very far from the dining hall, this section of the road was all muddy, and it was difficult to walk when it rained. Shiying saw Er'nai's thoughts and suggested: "Shitai has gone to the commune for a meeting and won't be back until the day after tomorrow. Mom, why don't you sleep with me tonight!" Er'nai was surprised: "I'm afraid it will be too crowded!"

　　"Such a wide bed, how could there not be enough room!" Shiying said, as she packed up her textbooks, got up and pulled Er'nai out of the dining hall. Shiying's place was on the side of the dining hall, and it was only a丈把 far from the back door of the dining hall.

　　Since the separation, Er'nai had not returned to the old house once in four years. Now that she entered the door, looking at the light, she saw that the hall and厢房 were all neatly arranged and clean, which made Er'nai feel unspeakably happy. Shiying saw that it was getting late and urged Er'nai to go to bed early. After a while, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law went to bed and slept head to toe. But tossing and turning, neither of them could fall asleep.

　　"Mom, at your age, why did you think of learning some culture?" Shiying spoke first.

　　"I think, since I'm a cook, I need to recognize a few words, so that I can follow the instructions on people's opinion books to improve the food."

　　"How many words have you learned in the past two months?"

　　"My eyesight is bad, my memory is not good, and it's inconvenient to run back and forth. Do you think there will be much benefit? If I lived closer to the dining hall, I wouldn't be like I am now, working for three days and taking two days off."

　　"Mom, we'll bring you back to live in the old house, wouldn't it be more convenient to study culture?"

　　Er'nai never expected Shiying to say such a thing, which made her feel both ashamed and excited. Ashamed that she shouldn't have had a bad attitude towards her daughter-in-law in the first place; excited that she could live with her daughter-in-law again after four years of separation. But how should she answer Shiying? So she said casually, "Shiying, let's discuss it with your dad tomorrow, and then move over on a free day, okay?"

　　The canteen not only connects people's lives into a whole, but also connects people's thoughts together. It is the nurturing of this collective life that has brought Er'nai and Shiying, who have been separated for four years, back together.
　
Visiting the Sick

　　In the evening, production team leader Tang Fang was eating in the canteen. For some reason, he couldn't settle down. His anxious eyes were constantly looking around.

　　"Have all the cattle herders returned?" The captain asked the commune members eating at the same table.

　　"They've all come back, aren't Luo Dengrong and Tang Yingguang eating?"

　　"Then, where did Tang Gong go?" So he put down his chopsticks and ran to Tang Shucheng's house in three steps. Sure enough, the old man was lying sick in bed. Captain Tang personally called the management district to ask for a doctor, helped the old man light a fire to decoct medicine, and also instructed the cook to cook porridge for the patient.

　　A few days later, the old man's illness did not improve, and Captain Tang stayed with him for three consecutive nights until the old man's illness improved. The old man was very grateful to the canteen and the captain for their concern. He said to Tang Fang, "Captain, you are truly a good party member. I just have one thing to ask you, who told you about my illness? Otherwise, I wouldn't have caused you so much trouble."

　　"Do I need someone else to tell me that? We all eat in the same canteen, like in our own home. Who is late for dinner, who hasn't come to dinner, who doesn't have a good appetite, how could I not know?"

　　After hearing the captain's words, the old man stared blankly at the boiling medicine pot on the stove, and looked at the porridge and vegetarian dishes placed in front of the bed, and couldn't help but shed tears. He thought: When I was cooking for myself, I often got sick. At that time, if I wanted a drink of water, I had to boil it myself, or I had to wait for my son and daughter-in-law to come back from work to do it. How could it be so convenient now!

    公共食堂散记	叶庆农	    分家四年又合居
    吴二奶一家十三口人，家庭主要成员，除了二奶的老伴唐福祥，就是她大儿唐世套和儿媳妇李世英。世套整日下田生产，世英一肩挑着养猪、养鸡、种菜、煮饭、洗衣、带小孩的担子。一天仅这些事就够她劳累的了，何况还要抽空出工做活路呢？但是二奶偏要“豆腐里挑刺”，不是说家务料理不周到，就是嫌她工分挣少了。有一天，世英出工回来迟了一点，刚踏进厨房，就听见二奶说：“这个家想是没人管了，水缸里干得可以晒米，天黑了这一阵子，猪没有喂，鸡没有关，几个娃崽早就吵着要吃饭……。”世英听了，实在忍不住，便说道：“妈，这也不能怪我嘛！”二奶想不到媳妇今天同她顶起嘴来，火就冒起来了：“我还敢怪哪个，我只怪我自己；像这样过日子，我看不惯，过罢今晚，我们两个老的带几个小的另找住处安身，也免得拖累你们。”就这样，在1954年8月5日，二奶和儿媳妇分居了。
    1958年8月中旬，这里实现公社化，也办起了食堂。二奶弄饭做菜的手艺，早在年青的时候，就是出了名的。食堂一建立，社员就选他当了食堂的炊事员。世英一家也在食堂吃饭，她有三个孩子，八岁的已送到管理区小学读书，三岁的进了生产队的幼儿班，不到一岁的由队里的托儿所照料，因此一些家务事都摆脱了，每月出工率由过去十来天，增加到二十五、六天。出勤率一增加，收入也增加了。办食堂后的头两个月，她和世套从领得的工资里拿出八块多钱扯了一丈四尺蓝布给二奶送去。二奶说：“还是留给几个孙娃崽做衣穿吧！”世英说：“他们穿的也买了，这是专为你老人家备办的。”二奶才笑着收下了。有一天晚上，婆媳两个正在饭厅里学文化。忽然外面下起倾盆大雨，一直下个不停，这就把二奶难住了。因为她住的地方离饭厅虽不很远，但中间这一段路，都是一些黄泥巴，碰上下雨很不好走，世英在一旁看出了二奶的心思，便提议道：“世套到公社去开会，要后天才回来，妈今晚就跟我歇好了！”二奶听了一惊：“怕挤不下吧！”
    “那样宽的床铺，还有个睡不下的！”世英边说边收拾课本，起身就拉着二奶离开了饭厅。世英住的地方，就在饭厅的侧边，一出饭厅的后门，只走丈把远就到了。
    自分家后，二奶整整四年没有回过老屋一次。现在她进得门来，借着灯光的亮一看，只见堂屋和厢房，都打整得有条有理，干干净净，真使二奶有说不出的高兴。世英见时间不早，催二奶早睡，一会儿工夫婆媳上床抵足而眠。可是翻来复去，谁也合不拢眼。
    “妈，你这把年纪了，咋个也想起要学点文化。”还是世英先开了口。
    “我想，既然当个炊事员，要认得几个字，也好按人家在意见本子上指点的话来办好伙食。”
    “这两个月你老人家认会了好多字？”
    “眼力差火，记忆不好，来回跑路不方便，你想会有好大的效益；要是住得靠饭厅近一些，也不至于像现在这样三天打鱼两天晒网了。”
    “妈，我们接你回老屋来住，学习文化不是就方便了吗？”
    二奶万想不到世英会说出这样的话，真是叫她感到又羞愧又激动。羞愧的是悔不该当初对媳妇态度不好；激动的是：想不到分居四年又能和儿媳住在一起。但是怎样回答世英的话呢，于是顺口说了一句：“世英，等明天跟爹商量一下，选个空闲日子再搬过来，好不？”
    食堂，不但把人们的生活联成一个整体，还把人们的思想，也联在一起了。正是这种集体生活的孕育，才使分居四年之久的二奶和世英，又言归于好了。		      探　病
    傍晚，生产队长唐芳正在食堂吃饭，不知怎的，他老是安定不下来，一双焦灼的眼睛，不时地到处张望。
    “放牛的人都回来了吗？”队长问同桌吃饭的社员。
    “都回来了，罗登荣、唐应光，不都在吃饭吗？”
    “那么，唐公哪里去了。”于是他放下碗筷，三步当两步跑到唐树成家。果然，老人正卧病在床上。唐队长亲身打电话到管理区，请来了医生，又帮老人生火煎药，还嘱咐炊事员替病人煮稀饭。
    几天以后，老人的病还不见轻，唐队长又接连守了他三个夜晚，直到老人的病好转为止。老人非常感激食堂和队长对他的关心，他对唐芳说：“队长，你真不愧是个好党员。只是有一句话想问你一下，我生病的事是哪个告诉你的，要不然也不会害你增添这多麻烦。”
    “那还用得着别人告诉我，都在一个食堂吃饭，就像在自己家里一样，哪个吃饭来晚了，哪个吃饭没有到，哪个的胃口不大好，还有个不知道的。”
    听了队长的话，老人呆呆地望着火炉上沸腾的药罐，望了床前摆的稀饭和素菜，不禁淌下了眼泪。他想：在单家独户起伙的时候，自己也经常生病，那时要想喝口水，也得自己动手烧，要不然就得等儿子、媳妇收工回来弄，哪有现在这样方便呵！
