Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: The "Lao Patriotic News," published on April 2nd, released a letter written on March 24th by Kaysone, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, to Kou Abhay, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos.

The letter stated that the Lao people across the country hope that the general election to be held on April 24th can be conducted in accordance with the constitution and the democratic, free, and equal principles repeatedly announced by the government.

The letter said that in order for the general election to achieve this goal, it is most essential to normalize the situation.

The letter said that the current reality is by no means normal. U.S. imperialism is strengthening its control over Laos in all aspects. The Lao civil war has dragged on for ten months and is continuing to extend and escalate. As a result of the "sweeps" by the Royal Army, tens of thousands of people have been driven into "concentration areas" or have left their homes and become displaced. Until now, the names of people in many places have not been included in the voter list, and local authorities in many places are preparing to have the county chiefs and village heads vote for the people. If the general election is conducted in this way, it is merely a sham that is undemocratic and blatantly deceptive.

The letter pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front, despite various obstacles, is determined to actively participate in the general election and send its own candidates. However, the situation has not eased in the slightest; on the contrary, it has become even more serious.

The letter said that, in general, it can be predicted that if the current situation does not change, the general election will certainly not meet the wishes of the people. In this way, it will not reflect the spirit of fairness and democracy stipulated by the constitution, and the elected National Assembly will not be able to represent the people, and "the country will not be able to escape the dark situation."

The letter said that, therefore, in order for the general election to be conducted under normal circumstances, and in order to guarantee the people's right to free election, the Lao Patriotic Front suggests:

\t1. The Royal Government orders a halt to all "sweeps" of all sizes and withdraws the troops to their strongholds in order to ensure that the people can vote safely.

\t2. Guarantee that the concentrated and displaced people return to their homes and issue sufficient voter certificates so that the general election can be truly universal.

As for the Lao Patriotic Front, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Lao Fighting Forces, together with all the people's armed forces, will cease anti-"sweep" activities.

The letter pointed out that to do this, the Royal Government must first restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and the members and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front who are being illegally imprisoned, and the two sides must immediately hold consultations.

The letter concluded by saying that we believe this is the only way to resolve the current situation in Laos.

The "Lao Patriotic News," published on April 3rd, published a call to action by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front to all the people of Laos.

The call to action pointed out that at present, U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," are delaying the civil war and vigorously promoting the conspiracy to turn Laos into a new type of colony and a war base for U.S. imperialism. The fate of all Lao people is under serious threat, and the motherland is in deep water. The call to action said, "Faced with a crisis that seriously threatens the fate of the motherland, we Lao people, regardless of class, ethnicity, religion, gender, or political party, should strengthen unity and struggle more than ever before for the interests of the motherland and the people, so as to promote the realization of the proposals of the Lao Patriotic Front and lead our beloved motherland to the road of true peace and neutrality."

    老挝爱国战线党副主席致函老挝首相
    要求根据民主自由平等原则进行大选
    指出要改变目前局势首先必须恢复苏发努冯等人的自由
    据新华社河内10日电　4月2日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”发表了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席凯山3月24日写给老挝王国政府首相库·阿贝的一封信。
    信中表示老挝全国人民希望即将在4月24日举行的大选能够根据宪法的规定和政府多次宣布的民主、自由、平等原则来进行。
    信中说，为了使大选达到这个目的，必须使局势正常化，这是最必要的条件。
    这封信说，但是，当前的实际情况却绝非正常，美帝国主义正在加强从各方面控制老挝，老挝内战拖延了十个月，目前正在继续延续而且日益扩大。由于王国军队的“扫荡”，成万人民被赶进“集中区”，或者离乡背井，流离失所。直到现在，许多地方的人民的姓名未被列入选民的名单，许多地方当局正在准备让县长、里长替人民投票。如果以这种方式进行大选的话，它只是毫无民主由自的、明目张胆骗人的一种把戏。
    信中指出，老挝爱国战线党方面，尽管受到种种阻碍，仍然坚决、积极地参加大选，并派出自己的候选人。但局势丝毫未有和缓，相反，更加严重起来。
    这封信说，总的来讲，可以预计，如果目前的情况不改变，大选就一定不能符合人民的愿望，这样，就不能体现宪法所规定的公平和民主的精神，选出的国民议会就不能代表人民，“国家就不能摆脱黑暗局势”。
    信中说，因此，为了使大选能在正常的情况下进行，为了保障人民的自由选举权利，老挝爱国战线党建议：
    一、王国政府下令停止一切大小规模的“扫荡”，并把军队撤回据点，以保障人民能够安全地投票。
    二、保证被集中起来和流离失所的人民回他们的家乡，并且发给足够的选民证，使大选能真正普遍地进行。
    至于老挝爱国战线党方面，寮国战斗部队第一营和第二营同所有的人民的武装力量将停止反“扫荡”的活动。
    信中指出，要作到这样，首先王国政府必须恢复正被非法监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的议员和干部的自由，双方必须立即进行协商。
    这封信最后说，我们认为这是解决当前老挝局势的唯一道路。
    4月3日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”刊登了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会向老挝全体人民发表的号召书。
    号召书指出，目前美帝国主义和它的走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”正在拖延内战，大力推行把老挝变成美帝国主义的新型殖民地和战争基地的阴谋，所有老挝人的命运正在受着严重的威胁，祖国正处于水深火热中。号召书说，“面对着严重威胁祖国的命运的危机，我们老挝人应当不分阶级、民族、宗教、男女、政党，为了祖国和人民的利益，比任何时候更加加强团结和斗争，以促使老挝爱国战线党的建议能够实现，促使我们亲爱的祖国走向真正和平中立的道路。”
