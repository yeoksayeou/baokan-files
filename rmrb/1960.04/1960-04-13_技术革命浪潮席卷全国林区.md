Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A technical innovation and technical revolution movement to realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of timber production has unfolded throughout the nation's forest areas. According to statistics from the forestry department, since last year, forestry workers across the country have created and improved more than 1,000 types of new tools. These tools are characterized by high efficiency, low cost, and adaptation to local conditions, playing a decisive role in overfulfilling timber production tasks.

	New Tools and New Methods
	Shine Brightly in the North and South

Over the past year, the northern forest areas have created and reformed more than 150 types of new tools for small-scale concentration, loading, unloading, and piling. Forestry enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have created lightweight logging vehicles, automobile pre-loading racks, automatic unloading platforms, etc.; forestry enterprises in Jilin Province have created automatic ice gully sleds, relay logging, etc.; and forestry enterprises in Inner Mongolia have created wooden rail flatcars and flatcar train-style logging, etc. These new tools are of universal promotional value. Most of the southern forest areas have generally eliminated human carrying and shoulder carrying, and have reformed and created hundreds of new tools such as various cableways, slides, and vehicles according to local conditions. These include the single-line automatic return cableway created by Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province; the water-wood mixed slide in Yuexi County, Anhui Province; the handcart suitable for logging on rugged mountain roads created in Guangdong and Hubei – the "Full Mountain Runner"; and more than 40 items such as wooden stake river ropes with low investment and no steel ropes created in Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Fujian. In the use of small streams for transportation, various methods such as flood-driven sheep and dry-water damming have been vigorously promoted in various places.

	High Efficiency and Low Cost
	Plans Completed Ahead of Schedule

Due to the vigorous promotion of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the labor intensity of workers has been reduced, labor productivity has been greatly improved, costs have been reduced, and many forest areas have completed their timber production tasks ahead of schedule. The Xiniqi Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia vigorously promoted the icing and ice gullyization of winter collection and transportation, and the trainization of transportation, as well as the mechanization and semi-mechanization of felling, loading, unloading, piling, and material selection, completing the annual timber production task eight and a half months ahead of schedule. Many provinces and regions such as Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hubei also exceeded their first-quarter timber production tasks in March.

	Continuous Production
	One-Hundred-Li One-Stop Service

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the timber production front has developed more deeply in various places since last winter, developing from partial areas to full bloom. A new situation of red flags becoming forests, pacesetters becoming rows, and experiences becoming complete sets has emerged in the nation's forest areas. Many areas have broken away from seasonal shock operations dominated by human and animal power, and have realized mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated year-round production. Some forest areas have developed from the past single, partial tool reforms to a new stage of complete sets and continuous flow. The Zhongxinshan Forest Farm of the Muling Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, on the basis of vigorously carrying out tool reforms, realized the continuous production of complete sets, so that timber is transported from the felling point on the mountain to the storage yard after one loading and one unloading, changing the past six processes of three loading and three unloading, shortening the production time from felling to the storage yard, increasing labor productivity by 40%, and reducing the labor force from the original 1,070 people to 420 people. The Linjiang Forest Industry Bureau in Jilin Province connected eight processes and more than ten production links, from felling to logging, transportation, and material creation, into a long dragon galloping day and night in the deep mountains and dense forests of two to three hundred li. The degree of mechanization of major processes has reached more than 95%. Last year, the average annual timber production of each production worker in this bureau has been increased to more than 230 cubic meters, the cost per cubic meter has been reduced to 9.94 yuan, and the timber circulation time has generally been shortened by three to five days, becoming a red flag with high efficiency, low cost, and fast capital turnover. Now, this bureau is marching towards overall mechanization and automation. (Attached picture)

(Left picture) Now, with the combined loading, unloading, and piling machine created by the old loading worker Zhao Changqing (middle picture), workers only need to sit on the console and operate the machine, and the big iron arm puts about two tons of timber on the train (right picture), which can replace the shoulder-carrying labor of dozens of workers.

    技术革命浪潮席卷全国林区
    据新华社讯　一个为实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的木材生产技术革新和技术革命运动，在全国各林区普遍展开。据林业部门统计：去年以来全国林业职工所创造和改良的各种新工具共达一千多项。这些工具都有效率高、成本低、因地制宜的特点，对超额完成木材生产任务起了决定性的作用。
      新工具新方法
      南北竞放异彩
    一年来，北方林区在小集中、装车、卸车、归楞等方面所创造和改革的新工具有一百五十多种。黑龙江省各林业企业创造出轻便集林车、汽车预装架、自动卸车台等；吉林省各林业企业创造出冰沟自动爬犁、接力集材等，内蒙古各林业企业创造出木轨木轮平车、平车列车式集材等。这些新工具都有普遍推广的价值。南方大部分林区已经普遍地消灭了人扛肩担，因地制宜的改革和创造出各种索道、滑道、车子等新工具数百种，其中有广东省高要县创造的单线自动回空索道；安徽省岳西县的水木混合滑道；广东和湖北创造的适宜崎岖山道集材的手推车——“满山跑”；还有湖南、广东、四川、福建所创造的投资少、不要钢绳的木桩河绠等四十多项。在利用小溪流送当中，各地大力推广了洪水赶羊、枯水筑坝等方法。
    效率高成本低
    计划提前完成
    由于大搞技术革新、技术革命运动，减轻了工人们的劳动强度，大大提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本，许多林区提前完成了木材生产任务。内蒙古大兴安岭林区西尼气林业局，大搞冬季集运材冰道化、冰沟化、运材列车化，采伐、装车、卸车、归楞、选材机械化半机械化，提前八个半月完成了全年的木材生产任务。黑龙江、内蒙古、湖北等许多省区，在3月中、下旬也都先后超额完成了今年首季木材生产任务。
      生产连续化
      百里一条龙
    木材生产战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，去冬以来在各地有了更加深入的发展，由部分地区发展到全面开花，在全国各林区出现了一个红旗成林，标兵成列，经验成套的新局面。许多地区已经摆脱了以人畜力为主的季节性突击作业，实现了机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的常年生产。部分林区已经由过去单项的、局部的工具改革发展到配套成龙连续化的新阶段。黑龙江省穆棱林业局中心山林场，在大搞工具改革的基础上，实现了生产配套连续化，使木材从山上采伐点，经过一装一卸就运到贮木场，改变了过去要经过三装三卸的六道工序，缩短了从采伐到贮木场的生产时间，提高了劳动生产率40％，劳动力由原来的一千零七十人，减少到四百二十人。吉林省临江森林工业局，把采伐到集材、运材、造材等八道工序十多个生产环节，在二百至三百里长的深山密林地带，衔接成一条日夜奔腾的长龙，主要工序机械化作业程度已达95％以上。去年这个局每个生产工人年平均生产木材已提高到二百三十多立方米，每立方米的成本降到九点九四元，木材流转时间一般缩短三至五天，成为效率高、成本低、资金周转快的一面红旗。现在，这个局正向全盘机械化自动化进军。（附图片）
    在内蒙古大兴安岭西尼气林业局的贮木场上，从来就是用人力装车、卸车和归楞，不仅工人的劳动繁重，而且容易发生事故。（左图）现在有了老装车工人赵长青（中图）创造的联合装车、卸车、归楞机，工人只要坐在操纵台上操纵机器，大铁臂就把两吨左右的木材放到火车上（右图），可以代替几十个工人的肩抬劳动。
