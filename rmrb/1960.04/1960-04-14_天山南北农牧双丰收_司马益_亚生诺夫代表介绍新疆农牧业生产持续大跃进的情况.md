Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I will strive to implement the guidelines and tasks outlined in these reports.

In 1959, like other brotherly provinces and regions, the agricultural and animal husbandry production in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region achieved a continuous leap forward based on the great leap forward of 1958. The total agricultural output value reached 1.336 billion yuan, an increase of 22.5% compared to 1958. The total grain output reached 7 billion jin, an increase of 16.7% compared to 1958. The total cotton output reached 1.61 million dan, an increase of 39.3% compared to 1958. The total oil crop output reached 2.4 million dan, an increase of 34.7% compared to 1958. Agricultural capital construction, especially water conservancy construction, achieved even more remarkable results. In 1959, the irrigated area was expanded by 3.67 million mu, and the improved irrigated area was 3.81 million mu. Great achievements have been made in agricultural technology transformation and scientific research. At present, the region has basically realized the use of new-style animal-drawn farm implements, and has 4,025 standard tractors, with mechanized farming accounting for 17% of the total cultivated area (mainly in state-owned farms). We have gained some experience in comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. These are all favorable conditions for achieving a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future.

Animal husbandry production has also greatly developed. In 1959, the total number of livestock reached more than 20.93 million head, a net increase of 12.38% compared to 1958. The work of breed improvement has made great progress. In 1959, 5 million hybrid improved sheep were produced, basically realizing the improvement of all sheep, greatly increasing the quantity and quality of livestock products. In pastoral areas, the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry was implemented, vigorously expanding the cultivated area, basically realizing self-sufficiency in grain and feed, and changing the nomadic state, basically realizing settlement, laying a good foundation for further development of agricultural and animal husbandry production.

In 1959, the state-owned agricultural and animal husbandry economy also developed rapidly, with a cultivated area of 9.95 million mu, accounting for about 25% of the region's total cultivated area. The rapid development and growth of the state-owned agricultural and animal husbandry economy has played a huge role in changing the economic landscape of the autonomous region and promoting the development of the entire socialist construction.

In addition, the afforestation and greening efforts have also been greatly developed, with a total of 2.07 million mu of afforestation and 2.52 million mu of desertification control throughout the year.

With the great development of production and construction, the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups have been further improved. In 1959, the total income of the people's communes increased by 18% compared to 1958, and more than 90% of the members increased their income. The purchasing power of the members increased by 25.2% compared to 1958, and the amount of savings increased by 186%. At the same time, nearly 30,000 public canteens, more than 19,000 nurseries, more than 6,500 kindergartens and other welfare, cultural and educational health services in the region are well run, and are becoming more and more consolidated and developed.

The experience of the past few years, especially the great leap forward of the past two years, proves that in order to develop Xinjiang's agricultural economy at a high speed, it is necessary to adopt the two-pronged approach of increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the cultivated area at the same time. We have adopted the principle of taking soil as the key link, water and fertilizer as the focus, comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture to increase yield per unit area; at the same time, vigorously reclaiming wasteland to increase the sown area. Only in this way can we fully tap the potential of agricultural production in the autonomous region and achieve greater success. Xinjiang has very little cultivated land, but there is a lot of fertile land available for cultivation, abundant water resources, increasing labor force year by year, and the degree of mechanization is constantly expanding. Under this situation, it is necessary to combine increasing the yield per unit area with expanding the cultivated area in order to develop agricultural production at a high speed. Since 1956, especially in 1958 and 1959, while striving to increase the yield per unit area, we have reclaimed wasteland on a large scale, and the expanded cultivated area accounted for 39% of the total cultivated area, and the unit yield of grain and cotton has also increased by 36.8% and 14.3% respectively. The concrete practice of implementing the simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry also proves that in pastoral areas, due to the result of wasteland reclamation, not only has the development of animal husbandry not been affected in the slightest, but on the contrary, it has solved the grain needs of the pastoral areas and laid the foundation for the construction of the feed and forage base most needed for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. The autonomous region's surface and underground water resources are extremely rich, and we have not yet been able to fully utilize them, especially the underground water resources have not yet been utilized, and there is still a serious waste of water. If we overcome this waste, implement rational water use, and continue to develop and utilize surface and underground water resources, guaranteeing the water use for expanding more than 100 million mu of cultivated land will not be a problem. According to the situation that some of the existing cultivated land in the autonomous region is saline-alkali land, we have vigorously carried out soil improvement movements focusing on drainage and alkali washing, and have achieved significant results. The facts of the past few years have proved that the autonomous region's policy of developing agricultural production based on the spirit of the general line and the specific conditions of Xinjiang is completely correct, while the opposition of some comrades and right-leaning opportunists in Xinjiang to the policy of simultaneously expanding the cultivated area and increasing the yield per unit area is completely wrong, and is not in line with the spirit of the general line and the actual situation of Xinjiang.

In 1960, the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the autonomous region will have a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1959. To this end, we will continue to adhere to the policy of taking grain as the key link, and on the premise of giving priority to increasing grain production, vigorously develop cotton, oil crops and other cash crops, and vigorously develop animal husbandry. We plan to produce 8.2 billion jin of grain, 2 million dan of cotton, and 2.5 million dan of oil crops this year. Continue to implement the policy of combining the development of agriculture and the development of animal husbandry, implement the simultaneous development of large livestock and the development of small livestock, the simultaneous development of sheep raising and the development of pig raising, and vigorously develop animal husbandry production. This year, the number of various livestock will increase by 3 million head more than in 1959, and actively and universally carry out breed improvement, promote superior varieties, and improve the quality of livestock. Forestry production should also be accelerated. This year, it is planned to afforest 2 million mu, control desertification of 4.3 million mu, and harvest 760,000 cubic meters of timber to ensure the needs of industrial construction.

In order to complete the task of increasing agricultural production, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the policy of simultaneously increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the cultivated area. Complete and overfulfill the plan for reclaiming 8 million mu of wasteland and planting various crops. It is necessary to comprehensively and implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions, and vigorously increase the yield per unit area. We will strive to achieve the yield targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule.

Actively carrying out agricultural technology transformation centered on tool reform is an important measure to accelerate agricultural production. To this end, we must comprehensively plan, specifically arrange, strengthen leadership, and deeply carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, reform tools and improve cultivation techniques. At present, it is necessary to combine indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, from low to high, actively create conditions for mechanization; further strengthen scientific research, and vigorously train agricultural technicians who are both red and expert to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

Continue to consolidate and strengthen the people's communes. It is necessary to constantly strengthen socialist and communist education for members and continuously improve the political and ideological awareness of members. Conscientiously implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, establish and improve the production responsibility system, and improve the management level of the communes. It is necessary to grasp production and life with one hand, further run collective life and welfare undertakings centered on public canteens, organize and arrange the life of members to ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production.

We are confident and capable of completing the above-mentioned agricultural and animal husbandry production tasks. Through the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the political awareness of the people of all ethnic groups and cadres has been greatly improved, the "Three Long Live's" have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the people's communes have been further consolidated and developed; the autumn-sown crops last year were planted more and better; the spring plowing production movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation carried out last winter and this spring has achieved great success. More than one million laborers in the region are fighting on the water conservancy front. As of the end of February, the completed large, medium and small-scale water conservancy projects can store 1.4 billion cubic meters of water; 307.7 billion jin of fertilizer have been accumulated, and an average of nearly 10,000 jin of fertilizer can be applied to each mu of spring-sown land. The spring plowing and sowing this year has shown a new situation of being early, fast and good from the very beginning; lambing and fostering and large livestock breeding are also doing very well. At the same time, young and middle-aged people supporting Xinjiang's construction have successively entered Xinjiang, and the problem of labor shortage will be solved soon. In particular, the continued westward advancement of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will bring about significant changes in the autonomous region's transportation situation. The movement of industry, commerce and other aspects to support agriculture has formed a climax. Under this excellent situation, as long as we make full use of favorable conditions, strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and follow the mass line, we will surely achieve a comprehensive great leap forward and great harvest in agricultural production this year!

    天山南北农牧双丰收
    司马益·亚生诺夫代表介绍新疆农牧业生产持续大跃进的情况各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理关于提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。并为贯彻执行报告中提出的方针、任务而努力奋斗。
    1959年，新疆维吾尔自治区的农牧业生产，和各兄弟省区一样，在1958年大跃进的基础上，获得了持续大跃进。农业总产值达到十三亿三千六百万元，比1958年增加22.5％。粮食总产量达到七十亿斤，比1958年增加16.7％。棉花总产量达到一百六十一万担，比1958年增加39.3％。油料总产量达到二百四十万担，比1958年增长34.7％。农业基本建设特别是水利建设，成绩更加显著。1959年共扩大灌溉面积三百六十七万亩，改善灌溉面积三百八十一万亩。农业技术改造和科学研究工作，都取得了巨大成绩。现在全区已基本实现了新式畜力农具化，并拥有拖拉机四千零二十五个标准台，机耕面积占总耕地面积的17％（主要在国营农场）。在全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”方面，取得了一定经验。这些都是今后更进一步实现农业生产更大跃进的有利条件。
    畜牧业生产也有了很大发展。1959年牲畜总头数达到二千零九十三万多头，比1958年净增12.38％。品种改良工作的成绩很大，1959年杂交改良绵羊五百万只，基本上实现了全部绵羊改良，大大提高了畜产品的数量和质量。在牧区贯彻执行了农牧结合的方针，大力扩大了耕地面积，基本上实现了粮食、饲料自给，并改变了游牧状态，基本上实现了定居，为进一步发展农牧业生产打下了良好基础。
    1959年，国营农牧业经济也获得了迅速发展，耕地面积达到九百九十五万亩，约占全区总耕面积的25％。国营农牧业经济的迅速发展壮大，对改变自治区的经济面貌和促进整个社会主义建设的发展，发挥了巨大的作用。
    此外，绿化造林事业也有了相当大的发展，全年造林二百零七万亩，治沙面积达二百五十二万亩。
    随着生产建设事业的大发展，各族人民的物质文化生活水平得到了进一步提高。1959年人民公社的总收入比1958年增加了18％，90％以上的社员都增加了收入。社员购买力比1958年增长了25.2％，储蓄额上升了186％。同时，全区近三万个公共食堂、一万九千多个托儿所、六千五百多个幼儿园以及其他生活福利、文教卫生事业都办得很好，并且越来越巩固和发展。
    几年来，特别是两年以来的大跃进的经验证明，为了高速度地发展新疆的农业经济，必须采取提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积同时并举的两条腿走路的方针。我们采取了以土为纲、以水肥为重点，全面贯彻执行“农业八字宪法”，提高单产；同时大力开垦荒地，增加播种面积。只有这样，才能够充分挖掘自治区农业生产的潜力，取得更大的成就。新疆现有耕地面积很少，而可耕的肥沃土地却很多，水利资源丰富，劳动力逐年增加，机械化程度不断扩大。在这种情形下，必须把提高单产和扩大耕地面积结合起来，才能高速度发展农业生产。1956年以来，尤其是在1958年和1959年，我们在努力提高单位面积产量的同时，大规模的开垦了荒地，扩大的耕地面积占总耕地面积的39％，粮食、棉花的单位产量也分别提高了36.8％和14.3％。实行农牧业同时并举的具体实践也证明，在牧区由于开荒造田的结果，不但没有丝毫影响畜牧业的发展，相反地，解决了牧区的粮食需要，和为高速度发展畜牧业最需要的饲草饲料基地的建设奠定了基础。自治区的地面和地下水利资源是极其丰富的，我们还远没有能够充分加以利用，尤其是还没有利用地下水利资源，目前在用水方面还存在着严重的浪费现象。如果我们克服了这种浪费现象，实行合理用水，再加上不断开发和利用地面和地下水利资源，保证再扩大一亿多亩耕地的用水是不会有任何问题的。我们根据自治区现有耕地中有部分盐渍地的情况，大力开展了以排碱洗碱为主的土壤改良运动，取得了重大的成就。几年来的事实证明，自治区根据总路线精神和新疆具体情况所采取的发展农业生产的方针是完全正确的，而新疆却有一些同志和右倾机会主义分子反对扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量同时并举的方针则是完全错误的，是同总路线的精神和新疆的实际情况不相符合的。
    1960年自治区的农牧业生产要有一个比1959年更大更好更全面的跃进。为此，我们继续坚持以粮为纲的方针，在优先增产粮食的前提下，大力发展棉花、油料和其他经济作物，大力发展畜牧业。我们计划今年生产粮食八十二亿斤，棉花二百万担，油料二百五十万担。继续贯彻执行发展农业和发展畜牧业相结合的方针，实行发展大畜和发展小畜同时并举，发展养羊和发展养猪同时并举，大力发展畜牧业生产。今年各种牲畜头数要比1959年净增三百万头，并积极普遍进行品种改良，推广优良品种，提高牲畜质量。林业生产也要加速发展，今年计划造林二百万亩，治沙四百三十万亩，林木采伐七十六万立方米，以保证工业建设的需要。
    为了完成农业增产任务，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积同时并举的方针。完成和超额完成开垦荒地八百万亩和多种作物的播种计划。必须全面地、因地制宜地贯彻执行“农业八字宪法”，大力提高单位面积产量。我们要力争提前五年实现农业发展纲要规定的单产指标。
    积极开展以工具改革为中心的农业技术改造，是加速农业生产的重要措施。为此，必须全面规划，具体安排，加强领导，深入开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，既要改革工具，也要改进栽培技术。目前必须实行土洋结合、由土到洋、由低到高，积极为机械化创造条件；进一步加强科学研究工作，大力培养又红又专的农业技术人员，以适应农业生产大跃进的需要。
    继续巩固和加强人民公社。必须经常加强对社员的社会主义和共产主义教育，不断提高社员的政治思想觉悟。认真贯彻“三包一奖”，建立和健全生产责任制，提高公社的经营管理水平。必须一手抓生产，一手抓生活，进一步办好以公共食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业，组织和安排社员的生活，以保证农业生产实现大跃进。
    上述农牧业生产任务，我们是有信心有条件能够完成的。经过反右倾斗争和整社运动，大大提高了各族人民群众和干部的政治觉悟，“三个万岁”已深入人心，人民公社得到进一步巩固和发展；去年的秋播作物种得多、种得好；去冬今春开展的以水利、积肥为中心的备耕生产运动，取得了巨大成就。全区一百余万劳动力战斗在水利战线上，截至2月底，完成的大、中、小型水利工程，可蓄水十四亿公方；已积肥三千零七十七亿斤，平均每亩春播地可施肥近万斤。今年的春耕播种一开始就呈现出了又早又快又好的新形势；接羔育幼和大畜配种也搞得很好。同时，支援新疆建设的青壮年已陆续进疆，缺乏劳力的问题将很快得到解决。特别是兰新铁路的继续西进，自治区的交通运输情况将发生重大变化。工业、商业及其他方面支援农业的运动已经形成高潮。在这种大好形势下，只要我们充分利用有利条件，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大走群众路线，一定能够取得今年农业生产的全面大跃进大丰收！
