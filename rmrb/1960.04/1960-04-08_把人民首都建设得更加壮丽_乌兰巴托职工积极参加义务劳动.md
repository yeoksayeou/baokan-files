    把人民首都建设得更加壮丽
    乌兰巴托职工积极参加义务劳动
    新华社乌兰巴托电　2日，在蒙古首都的中央和市级机关、企业等单位的全体职工参加了定期的美化乌兰巴托的义务劳动。
    这是为迎接蒙古人民革命四十周年（1961年）而发起的建设乌兰巴托市的义务劳动。从2日开始，每个星期六全市职工都要参加一天的义务劳动，一直到6月中旬为止。此外，蒙古职工每年参加二十六天的劳动锻炼的规定仍然继续执行。
    2日，职工们主要是参加挖修首都的地下水管道工程。职工们手执洋镐、铁锹和冻土搏斗，劳动热情很高。
    在这以前，乌兰巴托市曾经举办了为期两周的遵守政策法令和社会公共秩序的宣传活动，要求市民们注意公共卫生，保持个人整洁，向妨碍社会秩序的不良现象作斗争。现在，广大群众已经响应这个号召而行动起来了。
