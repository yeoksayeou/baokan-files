Fifteen Years of Raising Pigs: Not a Single One Died of Disease
Speech by Delegate Jia Baozhi

I fully endorse the reports made to the congress by the leading comrades and guarantee to resolutely implement them. Now, I will report to the congress on the situation of the Baijiagou Management Area of the Lüliang Pioneer People's Commune in Xing County, Shanxi Province, where no pig has died of disease in fifteen years.

In 1944, under the call of Chairman Mao, eight poor peasant households in Baijiagou established an agricultural cooperative that combined labor and military affairs. We had no livestock, no farm tools, just a few people with nothing. The anti-Japanese government lent us ten dan of millet and bought six sows and thirty-one piglets, thus beginning our collective pig-raising enterprise. Later, with the continuous expansion of the cooperative, the number of pigs also increased rapidly, especially after the advanced cooperative in 1956 and the people's commune in 1958, our pig-raising enterprise also saw a great leap forward. In 1959, in addition to selling 420 live pigs to the state and supporting fraternal management areas with 150 breeding pigs, we still had 2,692 pigs in stock, averaging 1.2 pigs per person. Income from pig raising accounted for 20% of the total agricultural income. Over fifteen years, Baijiagou has bred and raised a total of 9,952 pigs, and not a single one has died of disease. Our experience is:

First, "Strong Mothers, Fat Offspring." We attach great importance to selecting excellent breeding pigs. All sows and boars kept for breeding are chosen from the best of the best. Therefore, the piglets born are large, grow fast, are easy to feed, and have few problems. In 1954, we bought a Soviet improved large white pig, and in three years, we achieved the large white pig type. Last winter, we bought five Ukrainian Berkshire white pigs and Harbin improved pigs, and we will continue to improve the new pig breeds on the basis of large white pig breeding.

Second, "Feed Well, Raise Well." Our experience is "One Heart," "Two Divisions," "Three Fixes," "Four Not Afraid," "Five Diligent," and "Eight No-Nos." "One Heart" means that the feeder must be wholeheartedly dedicated, acting as the pig's "steward," pig "nanny," and pig "nurse." "Two Divisions" means managing boars and sows, large pigs and small pigs, good pigs and old, weak, and sick pigs separately, and feeding them in separate troughs. "Three Fixes" means fixing the number of meals, the time, and the amount of feed for the pigs. Large pigs are fed twice a day, small pigs are fed three times a day, and the amount of feed per meal must be fixed. "Four Not Afraid" means that the feeders are not afraid of getting dirty, not afraid of getting tired, not afraid of a shortage of feed, and not afraid of repairing pigsties. "Five Diligent" means diligently bathing the pigs, diligently adding bedding to the sties, diligently letting the pigs out of the sties, diligently cleaning, and diligently disinfecting. "Eight No-Nos" means no feeding when it's too hot, no feeding when it's too cold, no feeding too late, no feeding too early, no feeding too much, no feeding too little, no feeding too watery, and no feeding too thick. When adding feed to the trough, add the watery feed first and then the thick feed, add a small amount first and then a large amount. Only in this way can the pigs eat more, digest normally, and not have diarrhea, not vomit, and not get sick.

Third, "Seven Parts Prevention, Three Parts Cure." Swine fever and other pig diseases are the greatest threat to pigs. At first, we relied on local methods for prevention and treatment. Later, with the support of the government, we established a veterinary station, with specialized pig doctors, medicines, and equipment. Each production team and pig farm has trained epidemic prevention personnel, greatly strengthening epidemic prevention efforts. The main pig diseases prevalent in our area are pig pneumonia, swine fever, and swine erysipelas. Generally, pneumonia is easy to get in spring and summer, swine fever is easy to get in winter and summer, and swine erysipelas is easy to get in autumn. Now we have gradually figured out the symptoms of various pig diseases. We give the pigs salt every half month and pumpkins, boiled black beans, or rhubarb once a month, which is a mild laxative. At the same time, we often use grass ash to pad the sties and disinfect the sties with lime and 666 pesticide solution. We give the pigs four vaccinations a year to prevent pneumonia, swine fever, and swine erysipelas.

Fourth, "Self-Breeding, Self-Raising." For fifteen years, in addition to buying a few good breeds of pigs from other places, we have mainly relied on our own breeding, and we do not buy piglets from outside. Doing so not only promotes our own breeding work, but also greatly reduces the spread of disease and the death of pigs in transit.

Fifth, Strengthen Party Leadership. The most important reason why the pig-raising enterprise in Baijiagou has been able to develop rapidly is the attention paid by the Party branch. Each year, they formulate pig-raising plans and regularly organize inspections. From the management area to the production team, there is a responsible cadre in charge of pig raising. We also constantly strengthen political and ideological work among the feeders and commune members, launch competitions, conduct evaluations every quarter, and conduct a grand evaluation at the end of the year. Everyone is chasing after each other, and their enthusiasm is very high. In this management area, cadres and commune members all regard pig raising as very important and love them like treasures.

Comrades, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the farmers of Baijiagou are now working with even greater energy and higher confidence to reach 6,500 pigs in stock in 1960, and are striving to achieve the glorious task of averaging 2.5 pigs per person.

### 养猪十五年　一头没病死  贾宝执代表的发言

    养猪十五年　一头没病死
    贾宝执代表的发言
    我完全拥护各位首长向大会所作的报告，并保证坚决贯彻执行。现在，我把山西省兴县吕梁先锋人民公社白家沟管理区养猪十五年没病死过一头的情况，向大会作一次汇报。
     1944年，在毛主席的号召下，白家沟八户贫农办起了一个劳武结合的农业合作社。我们一没牲口，二没农具，只是几个光杆子人。抗日政府贷给我们十石小米，买了六头母猪和三十一头小猪，从此就开始了集体养猪事业。以后，随着合作社的不断扩大，猪的数量也在迅速增加，特别是经过1956年的高级合作社和1958年的人民公社化，我们的养猪事业也出现了一个大跃进。1959年除卖给国家生猪四百二十头，支援了兄弟管理区种猪一百五十头外，圈存猪仍有二千六百九十二头，按人口平均计算，每人达到一点二头猪。养猪收入占到农业总收入的20％。经过十五年，白家饲养沟共繁殖和饲养过九千九百五十二头猪，从来没有病死过一头。我们的经验是：
    第一，“母壮儿肥”。我们十分重视选用优良种猪，凡是留作繁殖的母猪和公猪，都是好的里边挑好的。因此，生下的仔猪都是个头大，长肉快，好喂养，毛病少。1954年，我们买了一头苏联优种大白猪，三年时间就实现了大白猪化。去年冬天，又买回乌克兰巴克夏白猪和哈尔滨优种猪五头，要在大白猪化的基础上，继续改良新猪种。
    第二，“喂好养好”。我们的经验是“一心”“二分”“三定”“四不怕”“五勤”“八不喂”。“一心”是饲养员要一心一意，当好猪“事务长”、猪“保姆”、猪“护士”。“二分”是把公猪和母猪，大猪和小猪，好猪和残老病猪分圈管理，分槽喂养。“三定”是喂猪定顿数、定时、定量，大猪一天喂两顿，小猪喂三顿，每顿喂多少要定量。“四不怕”是饲养员不怕脏，不怕累，不怕缺饲料，不怕修猪圈。“五勤”是勤给猪洗澡，勤垫圈，勤出圈，勤打扫，勤消毒。“八不喂”是不热喂，不冷喂，不迟喂，不早喂，不多喂，不少喂，不稀喂，不稠喂。往槽里添食要先稀后稠，先少后多。这样猪才能吃的多，消化正常，不拉稀，不吐食，不闹病。
    第三，“七分防”，“三分治”。猪瘟、猪病对猪的威胁最大，起初我们是靠土法防治，后来，在政府的扶植下，设立了兽医站，有了专门猪医、药品和器械。各生产队和养猪场都培养了防疫员，大大加强了防疫力量。我们那儿流行的主要猪病是猪肺炎、猪瘟、猪丹毒。一般是春、夏容易得肺炎，冬、夏容易得猪瘟，秋季容易害猪丹毒。现在我们也慢慢摸出了各种猪病的症状。我们给猪每半月啖一次盐，每月吃一次南瓜、煮黑豆或大黄，这是一种不缓不急的清火药。同时，经常用草木灰垫圈，用生石灰和六六六药水刷圈进行消毒。每年给猪打四次防疫针，预防肺炎、猪瘟和猪丹毒。
    第四，“自繁自养”。十五年来我们除从外地购买少数良种猪外，主要是依靠自己繁殖，不从外边购买仔猪。这样做，不但可以促进自己的繁殖工作，而且可以大大减少传染疾病和猪在流动中的死亡。
    第五，加强党的领导。白家沟养猪事业能够得到迅速发展，最重要的是由于党支部的重视，每年都制订养猪计划，经常组织检查，从管理区到生产小队都有一个负责干部专管养猪。对饲养员和社员还经常加强政治思想工作，发动竞赛，每季一评比，年终大评比，你追我赶，劲头很大。在这个管理区干部和社员都把养猪看得很重要，爱的赛珍宝。
    各位代表，我们白家沟的农民，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在党和毛主席的领导下，现在正以更大的干劲，更高的信心，在1960年使圈存猪达到六千五百头，为实现每人平均两头半猪的光荣任务而奋斗。
