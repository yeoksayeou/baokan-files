    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 25th: The Japanese people are continuously petitioning and demonstrating towards the Diet, resolutely opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    Today, approximately 500 cultural figures went to the Diet to submit petitions opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." This is the second in a series of petitions launched by the "Security Treaty Criticism Group," with most of today's participants being new.
    Before petitioning the Diet, they held a demonstration in front of the Diet building. After leaving the Diet, they held a demonstration around the Diet's perimeter walls, opposing the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."
    At a rally held before the petition, female poet Sumako Fukao emphasized in her speech to the petitioners: "We must stop the Diet from ratifying the 'Security Treaty,' even at the cost of our lives."
    After the petition, most of the participants also donated money to the two Buddhist monks who are on a hunger strike. They also visited the two hunger strikers to express their support.
    The Japan Women's Democratic Club also sent representatives to the Diet today, submitting an appeal opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" to the Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party.
    At the same time, approximately 500 representatives from Osaka, Fukuoka, Hyogo, and five other prefectures in western Japan also rushed to Tokyo today to submit petitions to the Diet opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    In the evening, approximately 2,000 representatives from central and southern Tokyo petitioned the Diet.
    The "Security Treaty" Problem Roundtable Conference," composed of cultural figures such as Kyushu University professor Michio Aoyama, held a meeting in Fukuoka City tonight to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Approximately 100 cultural figures from western Japan attended the meeting. The meeting issued a statement saying that the new "Security Treaty" violates the spirit of the Constitution. The statement condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government's conspiracy to adopt unilateral deliberation to ratify the new "Security Treaty."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 25th: The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was forced today to formally decide to withdraw its motion to request a summary report on the discussion of the new "Security Treaty" at the meeting of the Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" of the House of Representatives. The Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to unilaterally stop the discussion of the treaty through this motion, in order to force the House of Representatives to pass this aggressive military alliance treaty before the 26th, was thwarted.
    The Kishida Nobusuke group originally planned that if the House of Representatives could pass the treaty by April 26, even if the Senate could not pass it before the end of this Diet session on May 26, it could use the provisions of the Constitution to complete the ratification procedure by the Diet.
    However, due to the strong opposition of the opposition parties, the Japanese Diet has been deadlocked for several days and unable to hold meetings.
    In order to resolve this situation, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose of the Liberal Democratic Party, put forward a "mediation plan" this morning, agreeing to withdraw the motion to request a summary report, and the Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" of the House of Representatives will continue to discuss the new "Security Treaty"; however, the plan also stipulates that in the future, when deliberating the new "Security Treaty," "do not disrupt the order of the House of Representatives," attempting to restrain the opposition parties' actions to prevent the ratification of this treaty.
    Although the Kishida Nobusuke group was forced to agree to extend the time for discussion of the new "Security Treaty," it did not abandon its goal of forcing the Diet to ratify this aggressive treaty as soon as possible. The Liberal Democratic Party decided today to "strive to pass the new Security Treaty in the House of Representatives on May 13." Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Masajiro Kawashima revealed yesterday that the Kishida Nobusuke group is also conspiring to extend the Diet session to force the Diet to ratify the new "Security Treaty."

    On April 17, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee held a "General Mobilization Rally of Party Members to Prevent the Ratification of the New Security Treaty" in Tokyo. More than 10,000 people, including JCP members, family members of party members, and members of the Democratic Youth League, participated in the rally. A demonstration was held after the meeting.

    坚决反对批准日美军事条约  日本人民示威洪流涌向国会
    岸信介强使国会早日批准条约的阴谋已遭初步挫败
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本人民继续不断地向国会请愿和举行示威游行，坚决反对批准新日美“安全条约”。
    今天约有五百名文化界人士到国会去递交反对批准新“安全条约”的请愿书。这是“安全条约批判会”发动的一系列请愿中的第二次，今天的参加者大多数是新参加者。
    他们在向国会请愿之前在国会大厦面前举行了示威。他们从国会出来后，又在国会围墙四周举行了反对国会批准新“安全条约”的示威。
    在请愿之前举行的大会上，女诗人深尾须磨子在对请愿者讲话时强调说：“我们必须阻止国会批准‘安全条约’、甚至于牺牲生命也在所不惜。”
    请愿后，大多数参加者还捐款给进行绝食的两名佛教徒。他们还去访问这两位绝食者，以表示声援。
    日本妇女民主俱乐部今天也派代表前往国会，向众议院副议长、自由民主党、社会党、民主社会党递交了一份反对批准新“安全条约”的呼吁书。
    同时，日本西部的大阪、福冈、兵库和其他五个县的共约五百名代表今天也赶到东京，向国会递交了反对批准新日美“安全条约”的请愿书。
    晚间，东京中部和南部地区的代表共约两千人向国会进行了请愿。
    九州大学教授青山道夫等文化界人士组成的“安全条约”问题恳谈会”，今天晚上在福冈市举行会议反对批准新“安全条约”。参加集会的约有西部日本的文化界人士一百人。会议发表了一项声明说，新“安全条约”违反宪法的精神。声明谴责岸信介政府阴谋采取单独审议的手段来批准新“安全条约”。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：执政的自由民主党今天下午被迫正式决定撤回关于要求在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上作关于讨论新“安全条约”情况的小结报告的动议。自由民主党企图通过这项动议片面停止对这个条约的讨论，以便在26日以前强使众议院通过这个侵略性军事同盟条约的阴谋遭到挫败。
    岸信介集团原来还打算，如果能在4月26日由众议院通过这个条约，即使参议院在这次国会会议于5月26日以前不能通过，也可以利用宪法的规定算是完成国会批准的手续。
    但是由于在野党的坚决反对，日本国会一连几天陷入僵局，不能开成会。
    为了收拾这种局面，自由民主党的众议院议长清濑一郎今天早晨提出了一个“调停方案”，同意撤销要求作小结报告的动议，众议院“安全条约”特别委员会继续就新“安全条约”进行讨论；但是方案又规定今后在审议新“安全条约”时“不要扰乱众议院的秩序”，企图束缚在野党阻止批准这个条约的行动。
    岸信介集团虽然被迫同意延长讨论新“安全条约”的时间，但是并没有放弃尽可能早地强使国会批准这个侵略条约的目的。自由民主党就在今天决定要“争取在5月13日在众议院通过新安全条约”。自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎昨天发表谈话透露，岸信介集团还阴谋采取延长国会会期的手段，来强使国会批准新“安全条约”。（附图片）
    4月17日，日本共产党中央和东京都委员会在东京举行“阻止批准新安全条约党员总奋起大会”。日共党员、党员家属和民主青年同盟盟员等一万多人参加了大会。会后并举行示威游行。图为游行队伍的一个场面。
