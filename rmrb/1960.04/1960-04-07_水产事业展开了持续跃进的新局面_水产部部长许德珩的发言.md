Comrades Representatives:
    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft of the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget. Now, on behalf of the Ministry of Aquatic Products, I will report to the Congress on the work of aquatic products, and I ask all representatives to examine and correct it.

    The Tremendous Achievements of the Aquatic Products Industry Over the Past Decade
    Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the aquatic products industry, like other sectors of the national economy, has made tremendous progress, especially in the great leap forward years of 1958 and 1959, achieving even greater accomplishments. In 1959, China's total aquatic product output reached 5.02 million tons, more than eleven times the 450,000 tons in 1949, and more than 60% higher than the 3.12 million tons in 1957.
    At the beginning of liberation, the boats, nets, and tools for aquatic production were both backward and dilapidated, aquatic science and technology were almost non-existent, and aquatic education was of low quality and small scale. Today, we have nearly three thousand fishing boats and motorized sailing vessels, the carrying capacity of non-powered fishing boats has also doubled, there are sixty-eight scientific research units with seven hundred and eighty-six researchers, and forty-four higher and secondary specialized aquatic schools with four thousand and seventy-two graduates, more than double the total number of talents cultivated in the forty years before liberation. The basic workforce for aquatic production has also undergone fundamental changes, with more than two million scattered, privately-owned small-scale fishery producers, through the path of mutual aid and cooperation, forming people's communes characterized by being large in size and having a high degree of public ownership, thereby further unfolding a situation of sustained leap forward in aquatic production. State-owned enterprises have also developed from scratch into a production force of more than 60,000 people. On the basis of continuous production development, the mental outlook and material life of the broad masses of fishermen have also been fundamentally improved, with incomes increasing year by year, living standards constantly improving, and cultural and welfare undertakings becoming increasingly popular, with everyone living a life free from worries about food and clothing, and a happy mood. The fate of "fishermen being poor for generations" has long gone forever.
    In 1958 and 1959, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, driven and inspired by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and relying on the infinite power of the people's communes, the aquatic products industry, on the basis of the great achievements of the previous eight years, ushered in a new situation of continuous great leaps forward. Total output increased from 3.12 million tons in 1957 to 5.02 million tons, completing and exceeding the original target for the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The average annual increase in the two years was 26.9%, twice as fast as the growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan.
    Because the people's communes implemented a system of simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the distribution of aquatic products has been further changed. Areas with an existing foundation in aquatic products have further expanded their scale, and some regions are striving to achieve fish farming wherever there is water. Many areas with a poor or non-existent foundation have also established bases for aquatic production to varying degrees, and many mountainous plateaus that never raised fish before have also started to do so. There are no longer any provinces without aquatic products.
    After the great development of the aquatic products industry in the past two years, the production field has been further expanded. Not only has capture fisheries achieved new development, but artificial cultivation has also flourished everywhere. The aquatic products industry has developed into a comprehensive production endeavor. In terms of cultivation production, the output in the past two years has increased by 1.6 times, and its proportion of the total output has increased from 22% to 36%. Not only has marine cultivation developed, but freshwater cultivation has also been widely promoted. Due to the attention paid to freshwater cultivation, the output of freshwater has also doubled in the past two years, and its proportion of the total output has increased from 37% to 45%.
    The variety of aquatic products has also greatly increased. Not only have the varieties of fish increased, but the proportion of crustaceans, shellfish, and algae has also increased accordingly. With the increase in varieties and the improvement of processing technology, the uses of aquatic products have become more extensive. More than 100 kinds of products have been manufactured through comprehensive utilization, providing a rich source of raw materials for light industry, the chemical industry, and the pharmaceutical industry.
    In the past two years, the technical level of aquatic production has also greatly improved. Some key problems in production have been solved, and the production experience of the masses has been systematically summarized. In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, according to extremely incomplete statistics, there have been more than 2,000 innovation projects in the aquatic products field, some of which are important inventions and creations that solve key production problems, enabling production to develop rapidly. In 1958, we also systematically summarized and improved the production experience of the masses, such as the "eight-character intensive farming method" in cultivation (suitable depth, fertility and oxygen content of water; healthy and large fish fry; sufficient, fresh and highly effective bait; reasonable stocking density in the water body; mixed stocking of various water layers and sizes of fish; combination of rotating stocking and rotating harvesting; prevention of diseases, pests and escape; management by special personnel), and the "five-character production increase measures" in capture fisheries (finding fishing grounds; simultaneous operation of multiple tools for rotation; tool reform; resource protection; safe production). These are the combination of modern science and technology and the masses' many years of production experience, and have played a significant practical guiding role in improving the unit yield of cultivation and capture fisheries.

    Comrades Representatives: The fundamental reason why the aquatic products industry has gone from victory to victory since liberation is the result of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. The emergence of the continuous great leap forward situation in aquatic products in 1958 and 1959 more specifically proves the unparalleled correctness of the three magic weapons proposed by the Party for building socialism: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. With them and their correct application, we can guarantee a higher speed and sustained leap forward in various construction undertakings. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    However, we are by no means satisfied with the achievements already made. Today, aquatic products are still far from meeting the growing needs of the country and the broad masses of the people. The aquatic products industry needs to be further greatly developed, and our work needs to be continuously improved and enhanced. We must better study Chairman Mao's works, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with full confidence and high fighting spirit, strive for greater and more comprehensive leaps forward in the 1960s.

    Aquatic Products Industry Must Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements
    Since the Great Leap Forward, we have deeply realized that resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party and implementing the Party's mass line are the fundamental guarantees for realizing the great leap forward in the aquatic products industry. As long as the aquatic products industry relies on the masses, vigorously carries out mass movements, gives full play to the subjective initiative of people, mobilizes all positive factors, and correctly grasps and applies the objective laws of aquatic product development, it will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and realize a great leap forward in development. There are many vivid examples since the Great Leap Forward. For example, in the second half of 1958 and 1959, although the labor force, production tools, etc. in the aquatic products industry were improved to some extent, the difference between them and the first half of 1958, or even 1957, was not very great. In 1959, there were also several major typhoons. However, due to the in-depth implementation of the General Line, the power of the People's Communes, the mobilization of positive factors in various aspects, and the launch of a massive mass movement, the broad masses of fishermen and all employees were in high spirits and full of energy, broke superstitions, and liberated their minds. As a result, production increased by 1.9 million tons in two years, which was 31% more than the total increase in the previous five years. It became the two years with the fastest development speed, the largest expansion scale, the most inventions and creations, and the richest production experience since liberation. For example, in the first half of 1959, although aquatic production also made considerable progress, due to the influence of right-leaning conservative thinking, some people developed emotions of fear of difficulty and slackening of effort, and lacked confidence in whether they could strive for a sustained great leap forward. However, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued instructions to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, the political awareness of the broad masses was greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production surged rapidly, immediately setting off a new upsurge in production. The third quarter, which was previously considered a off-season, became a major peak season, and production after October rose even more linearly, changing the conventional practice of completing 60% of the annual production task in the first half of the year and 40% in the second half, and comprehensively completing the tasks of aquatic production, purchasing and marketing, supply and export ahead of schedule. These facts powerfully educated all cadres on the aquatic products front, further recognizing the enormous power of mass movements and the truth that "man can conquer nature."

    Through several years of production practice, we have also deeply realized that to develop the aquatic products industry at a high speed, we must implement the policy of walking on two legs. Under the guidance of this policy, a series of parallel approaches have been adopted in the aquatic products industry, thereby comprehensively mobilizing the positive factors in regions, operations, resources, manpower, and capital, and finally converging into a torrent of the great leap forward in aquatic products. Among the series of parallel approaches, the following three are the most important. The first is the parallel development of cultivation and capture fisheries. China has vast water surfaces for cultivation, and the masses have excellent cultivation traditions; at the same time, China also has capture fishing grounds with rich resources and a strong capture fishing force. If one of them is neglected, the field of production will be greatly reduced. Facts have proved that cultivation and capture fisheries can not only be carried out simultaneously and in parallel without conflict, but can also promote each other and complement each other under certain conditions. The second is the parallel development of marine and freshwater resources. China has four major sea areas: the Yellow Sea, the Bohai Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea, with a coastline of more than 10,000 kilometers and rich aquatic resources. The shallow sea beaches along the coast are mostly suitable for developing aquatic products; at the same time, China is also one of the countries with the most inland water areas. Not only do the southeastern provinces and river basin areas have many, but the northwest also has some "marshes," "lakes," original lakes, and virgin "seas," which also contain many fish. In addition, the many newly built reservoirs have further expanded the inland freshwater surface. Obviously, these two types of aquatic resources, marine and freshwater, cannot be neglected either. From the results of our actual work, simultaneous development of marine and freshwater resources, and separate advancement, not only do not conflict with each other, but also promote and support each other to a certain extent. The third is the parallel development of state-owned fisheries and commune-operated fisheries. At present, although the output of state-owned fisheries owned by the whole people accounts for a small proportion, it has advanced technical equipment, higher product quality, and is in a leading position. It can carry out production demonstrations and specifically help the development of commune-operated fisheries in many ways; although the tools and technology of commune-operated fisheries still need to be improved, they have always shouldered more than 90% of the total output, and the communes have great potential in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. With the support of the state and the efforts of the communes themselves, they can gradually move towards production mechanization and modernization. In short, it is necessary to develop both state-owned fisheries and commune-operated fisheries, and to pay attention to both quality improvement and quantity expansion, so that the aquatic products industry can develop in a comprehensive and healthy manner. However, when implementing the three parallel approaches, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary, and focus on certain aspects, depending on the time and location. We have preliminarily inspected the development of the aquatic products industry in various places, and have seen that most areas have achieved rapid development due to the implementation of the policy of walking on two legs, but there are also individual areas that have not reached the due speed. Although each has its own reasons, it is always related to insufficient attention to the various parallel approaches.

    In the great era where one day equals twenty years, we have many experiences in our actual work, but resolutely relying on the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and implementing the policy of walking on two legs are our most basic experiences.

    Tasks of the Aquatic Products Front in 1960
    1960 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in China's socialist construction. In agriculture, it is necessary to continue to take grain as the key link and develop diversified operations in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; at the same time, with the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's demand for aquatic products will also greatly increase. Therefore, the aquatic products industry must continue to leap forward on the basis of the great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state-stipulated task of 5.8 million tons, and strive to have greater development in aquatic production in the next three years. At the same time, accelerate the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of aquatic production.
    This is a plan for sustained leap forward, and the task is of course arduous. However, as long as we resolutely rely on the Party, vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, and implement the policy of walking on two legs in aquatic production, it is entirely possible to complete this task. In fact, after opposing right-leaning and encouraging hard work, the Party's General Line has become even more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; Party committees and people's committees in various places have attached greater importance to and strengthened their leadership over the aquatic products industry, and the state has given more support to aquatic products; after rectification and commune consolidation, the People's Communes are increasingly demonstrating their powerful power, and in the development of diversified operations, they have universally attached importance to the development of fisheries; aquatic production has already had a set of policies and measures for walking on two legs and increasing production, and cadres and the masses also have rich experience from the two years of great leaps forward. All of these are favorable conditions for us to complete the task. It can be said that the conditions for developing aquatic products now are more favorable than at any time in the past, whether in terms of politics, organization, technology, or materials.

    In order to comprehensively realize the above plan, we must focus on doing the following tasks well:
    First, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements for mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. At present, most of aquatic production is still manual operation, which takes up a lot of labor and has low labor productivity. This is not compatible with the requirements of high-speed development of socialist construction. In the future, it is obviously impossible to increase output simply by increasing labor. Therefore, it is necessary to transition to mechanization and semi-mechanization through technical innovation and technical revolution, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in aquatic products must proceed from the reality of production, focus on tool reform, and adopt a method of combining foreign and local methods, and learning from local and foreign experiences. Within three years, we must first basically realize the motorization and sail mechanization of marine capture production, and strive to achieve nylonization of fishing nets, telemetering of production command, perennial operation, diversification of varieties, and mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of freshwater capture and marine and freshwater cultivation production; we are also prepared to actively carry out this according to conditions, and pay attention to combining it with the mechanization of agriculture, and try our best to make mechanical equipment comprehensively utilized. Other high-yield technologies for cultivation and capture fisheries, cultivation of improved varieties, capture of mid-water fish, and the application of sound, light, and electricity in fisheries, are also actively researched and tested, so that China's aquatic technology can rapidly develop towards high (level), precise (cision), sharp (end), and comprehensive utilization of aquatic products. We must extensively mobilize the masses and launch a vigorous technical revolution movement. The work of aquatic scientific research and the training of cadres will also be centered on this task.

    Second, comprehensively develop urban and rural fisheries. According to the policy of simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the People's Communes, we must vigorously organize professional and sideline teams of fisheries in the communes to carry out perennial and seasonal, commercial and self-sufficient cultivation and capture production, and strive for fish production in communes with suitable conditions, increase commodity volume, increase commune accumulation, improve the lives of commune members, and support agricultural development. According to the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and striving for external assistance as a supplement for urban non-staple food, we must actively develop urban fisheries and strive to gradually achieve basic self-sufficiency in urban aquatic products. There are many favorable conditions for developing fisheries in urban areas. Urban water surfaces are generally more numerous, the water quality is fertile, and feed is abundant; manpower, materials, financial resources, technology, and mechanical equipment are also easier to solve than in rural areas. Giving priority to the development of urban fisheries can further drive the development of rural fisheries.

    Third, actively establish fishery bases. Adopt the policy of combining foreign and local methods, and combining large, medium, and small (mainly small) sizes, and strive to build fishery bases in concentrated production areas along the coast and inland within three years. The construction of the base focuses on supporting production, and includes the construction of production and safety equipment such as breakwaters, navigation marks, lighthouses, docks, warehouses, ship repair yards, and rope and net factories. At the same time, in order to master more commodity fish, further improve the market supply in cities, industrial and mining areas, and forestry and pastoral areas, and increase exports, it is also necessary to build necessary cold storage and processing plants.

    Fourth, China's northeast, northwest, and southwest regions have rich inland water areas, and many aquatic resources have not been developed. According to the policy of local production and local supply, in addition to developing aquatic production in areas with a better foundation at a higher speed, we must actively develop the aquatic products industry in the northeast, northwest, and southwest regions. In many places in these regions, the water surface is large and the fish are abundant. It is really "fishing for fish with a dipper after hitting a roe deer with a stick." However, there is little or even no production now. The development prospects in these areas are very large. After development, not only can the output be greatly increased, but it can also fundamentally change the distribution of China's aquatic products. At that time, except for a few special aquatic products that need to be appropriately transferred and supplied nationwide, generally there will be no more transportation of fish from the south to the north or from the east to the west.

    Fifth, continue to implement diversified operations with fish as the main focus and comprehensive operations of fisheries, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. We must further expand the variety of aquatic products. The variety of fish should be expanded, and shellfish, crustaceans, and algae other than fish should also be expanded. Other aquatic animals and plants with high economic value and wide uses should also be developed. Aquatic products are one of the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Therefore, we must not only expand the variety of aquatic products themselves, but also use all possible water surfaces and land to carry out comprehensive operations of fisheries, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, especially developing silkworm breeding and animal husbandry, planting flax and bamboo, and other productions that serve aquatic products. Some areas use aquatic plants to raise pigs, use pig manure to fertilize water to raise fish, and use pond mud and fish manure to fertilize fields for recycling, which greatly reduces costs and increases income. The experience of "one pig per mu of pond" has recently been adopted in many areas, and we are vigorously promoting it.

    Sixth, do a good job in supply and marketing. According to the policy of simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production in the People's Communes, aquatic product supply and marketing work must vigorously support production and promote communes to increase commodity volume, so as to ensure the supply of cities, industrial and mining areas, and forestry and pastoral areas, and the needs of exports. Although the amount of aquatic products on the market has increased recently, the amount of commodities directly allocated by the state is still relatively small compared with the growth rate of production. Therefore, aquatic product supply and marketing departments must strengthen the purchase work for concentrated production areas and scattered production areas, and for large aquatic products and small aquatic products; at the same time, they must strengthen ideological education for fishermen to improve the commodity rate, increase public accumulation, and expand reproduction, and organize the supply of fisheries production materials and means of livelihood to increase the purchase volume.

    Comrades Representatives: Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the hard work of the broad masses of fishermen and all aquatic product workers, as well as the cooperation of all parties, has achieved great achievements in the aquatic products industry. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work. The representatives have put forward many valuable opinions in the previous inspection work, which have given us great encouragement. This has played a great role in improving our work and further developing the aquatic products industry. I sincerely hope that all the representatives will often give us more guidance. The great development of aquatic production is also inseparable from the strong support of commercial, meteorological, railway, transportation, civil aviation and other related departments, especially the People's Navy's defense of the coast and protection of fisheries production, which gives us great help. Here, I would like to extend my cordial greetings to the people's soldiers who are fighting day and night on the ocean.

    Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on doing a good job in the spring fishing production work, which is a great encouragement to the entire aquatic products front. Now, the prelude to the battle to seize a bumper harvest in the spring fishing season has begun. The fishermen's production army on the ocean is working hard and diligently and setting out to sea fifteen days to one month earlier than in previous years; in terms of freshwater, a production upsurge of building fish ponds, catching seedlings, and engaging in capture fisheries has been launched; marine culture teams have also taken action on various fronts; all these good beginnings indicate a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward in the aquatic products industry this year. We must, under the leadership of the Party, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, muster greater efforts, carry out vigorous mass movements, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, brave the wind and waves, and advance victoriously.

    水产事业展开了持续跃进的新局面
    水产部部长许德珩的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。现在，我代表水产部向大会报告水产工作情况，请各位代表审查、指正。
    水产事业十年来的巨大成就
    解放以来，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，水产事业也和国民经济其他各部门的事业一样，有了巨大的发展，特别是在大跃进的1958年和1959年，取得了更大的成就。1959年我国水产总产量达到五百零二万吨，为1949年四十五万吨的十一倍多，比1957年的三百一十二万吨增长60％多。
    解放之初，水产生产的船网工具，既落后又破旧，水产科学技术几乎是一个空白，水产教育质低量少。今天，我们已经有了渔轮和机帆船近三千艘，无动力渔船的载重量也翻了一番，科学试验研究单位六十八个，研究人员七百八十六人，高等和中等水产专业学校四十四所，毕业的学生达四千零七十二人，比解放前四十年所培养出来的人材的总和还多一倍。水产生产的基本队伍，也发生了根本的变化，二百多万分散的、私有的小渔业生产者，经过互助合作的道路，进而组成了一大二公的人民公社，从而进一步展开了水产生产的持续跃进的局面，国营企业也从无到有，发展成为拥有六万多人的生产队伍。在生产不断发展的基础上，广大渔民的精神面貌和物质生活也有了根本的改善，收入年年增加，生活不断提高，文化福利事业日益普及，人人都过着不愁吃、不愁穿、心情舒畅的生活，“捕鱼人儿世世穷”的命运早已一去不复返了。
    1958年和1959年，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的带动和鼓舞下，依靠人民公社的无穷威力，水产事业在前八年巨大的成就基础上，又出现了连续大跃进的新局面。总产量由1957年的三百一十二万吨，提高到五百零二万吨，提前并超额完成了原订第二个五年计划指标。两年间每年平均递增26.9％，比第一个五年计划期间的增长速度快了一倍。
    由于人民公社实行了农、林、牧、副、渔五业并举，进一步改变了水产的分布状况。原来水产有基础的地方，更加扩大了规模，有的地区正在努力争取做到有水就养鱼的地步。许多基础较差或没有基础的地方，也都或多或少地建立起水产生产的基点，不少从来不养鱼的山区高原也养了鱼，完全没有水产的省份，已经是没有了。
    经过这两年水产事业的大发展，生产领域更为扩大。不仅仅捕捞生产有了新的发展，人工养殖也遍地开花，水产事业已经发展成为全面性的生产事业了。就养殖生产来说，两年来的产量，增加了一点六倍，占总产量的比重由22％提高到36％。这里不仅海水养殖发展了，淡水养殖也普遍的抓起来了，由于注意了淡水养殖，淡水的产量两年来也增加了一倍，占总产量的比重由37％提高到45％。
    水产生产的品种也大大的增多了，这里不仅鱼类的品种增多，介类、贝类、藻类的比重也相应的增多了。随着品种的增多和加工技术的改进，水产品的用途也更加广泛了，经过综合利用制造出来的产品达一百多种，为轻工业、化学工业、医药工业的某些原料提供了丰富的来源。
    两年来，水产生产的技术水平也有了很大的提高。解决了生产上一些关键性的问题，系统地总结了群众的生产经验。在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，水产方面群众的革新项目，据极不完全的统计，就有两千多项，其中有的是解决生产上关键问题的重要发明创造，使生产得以迅速发展。1958年，我们还系统地总结与提高了群众的生产经验，如养殖方面的“水（适当深度、肥沃度和含氧量的水）、种（健壮而大的鱼种）、饵（量足、质鲜、效高的饵料）、密（水体中合理的放养密度）、混（各种水层和大小的鱼类混合放养）、轮（轮流投放和轮流捕捞相结合）、防（防病、防害、防逃）、管（专人管理）”八字精养法，捕捞方面的“找（找寻渔场）、兼（多种工具兼作轮作）、改（工具改革）、保（保护资源）、安（安全生产）五字增产措施，就是现代科学技术和群众多年生产经验的结合，对提高养殖和捕捞的单位产量，起了重大的实际指导作用。
    各位代表：解放以来，水产事业从胜利走向胜利的根本原因，是党和毛主席的正确领导和社会主义制度的无比优越性的结果。1958年和1959年，水产连续大跃进局面的出现，更具体地证明了党所提出的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝无比的正确性，有了它并正确地运用它，就可以保证各项建设事业更高速度的持续跃进。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    但是我们绝不满足于已经取得的成就，今天，水产品还远不能满足国家和广大人民日益增长的需要，水产事业还需要更进一步大加发展，我们的工作还需要不断地改进和提高。我们要更好地学习毛主席的著作，在毛泽东思想的指导下，信心百倍，斗志昂扬地在六十年代，争取更大更全面的跃进。
    水产事业必须大搞群众运动
    大跃进以来，我们深深地体会到，坚决依靠党的领导，贯彻执行党的群众路线，是实现水产事业大跃进的根本保证。水产事业只要依靠群众，大搞群众运动，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，调动一切积极因素，正确地掌握和运用水产的客观发展规律，就一定能够克服一切困难，就一定能够实现大跃进的发展速度。大跃进以来生动的事例很多，如1958年下半年和1959年，水产事业中的劳动力、生产工具等等，虽然有所改进，但和1958年上半年甚至和1957年的差别并不太大，而在1959年又遇到几场特大的风灾，但由于总路线的深入贯彻，人民公社的力量，调动了各个方面的积极因素，开展了声势浩大的群众运动，广大渔民和全体职工意气风发，干劲冲天，破除了迷信，解放了思想，结果两年间增产一百九十万吨，比前五年增产的总和还多31％，成为解放以来发展速度最快，扩展规模最大，发明创造最多，增产经验最丰富的两年。又如1959年上半年，水产生产虽然也有相当进展，可是由于右倾保守思想作怪，一部分人就发生了畏难松劲的情绪，对能否争取持续的大跃进，缺乏信心。但在党的八届八中全会发出反右倾鼓干劲的指示以后，广大群众的政治觉悟大大提高，生产热情迅速高涨，立即掀起了新的生产高潮，过去被认为淡季的第三季度，却变成了大旺季，10月以后生产更是直线上升，改变了历来上半年完成全年生产任务六成，下半年完成四成的常规，全面地提前完成了水产生产、购销和供应出口的任务。这些事实有力地教育了水产战线上全体干部，进一步认识到群众运动的巨大威力，认识到“人定胜天”的真理。
    通过几年来的生产实践，我们也深深地体会到，要高速度发展水产事业，必须贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。在这个方针的指导下，水产事业中采取了一系列的并举，从而全面地调动了地区、作业、资源、人力、资金等方面的积极因素，终于汇成了水产大跃进的洪流。在一系列的并举中，下面三个又是最主要的。第一是养殖和捕捞并举。我国有广阔的养殖水面，群众有优良的养殖传统；同时，我国也有资源丰富的捕捞渔场，有一支强大的捕捞队伍，如果忽视其中的一项，生产的领域就要大为缩小。事实证明，养殖和捕捞不但可以同时并举，并行不悖，在一定条件下还可以互相促进，相辅相成。第二是海水和淡水并举。我国有黄海、渤海、东海、南海四大海区，海岸线长达一万数千公里，水产资源丰富，沿岸的浅海滩涂，也大都适宜于发展水产；同时，我国又是内陆水域最多的国家之一，不但东南各省和江河流域地区，就是西北也有一些“沼”、“淖”、原始湖、处女“海”，蕴藏鱼类也很多。加上新修的许多水库，使内陆淡水水面更加扩大了。显然，海水和淡水这两类水产资源也是不可偏废的。从我们实际工作的结果来看，海水和淡水同时发展，分头并进，不仅互不冲突，在一定意义上还有互相促进、互相支援的作用。第三是国营渔业和社营渔业并举。目前全民所有制的国营渔业，产量虽占比重不大，但技术装备先进，产品质量较高，并处于领导地位，可以进行生产示范，从多方面具体帮助公社渔业的发展；公社渔业的工具和技术虽然仍待改进，但历来担负着占总产量90％以上的任务，而且公社一大二公，人力物力财力都有很大的潜力，在国家的支援和公社自己的努力下，是可以逐步走向生产机械化、现代化的。总之，既要发展国营渔业又要发展公社渔业，既要注意质的提高，又要注意量的扩大，这才能使水产事业全面健康的发展。但是，实行三个并举时，又必须因时因地分别主次，有所侧重。我们初步检查了一下各地水产事业的发展情况，看到了大部分地区由于贯彻执行了两条腿走路的方针而获得迅速的发展，但也有个别的地区没有达到应有的速度，尽管各有它的原因，但是同对于各个并举注意不够总是有关系的。
    在一天等于二十年的伟大时代里，我们在实际工作中的体会是很多的，坚决依靠党，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，则是我们最基本的体会。
    1960年水产战线的任务
    1960年是我国社会主义建设更大更好更全面跃进的一年，在农业方面，要继续以粮为纲，发展林、牧、副、渔多种经营；同时，工农业生产大发展，人民对水产品的需要量也将大大增加。因此，水产事业，必须在1958年和1959年大跃进的基础上继续跃进，保证完成和超额完成国家规定的五百八十万吨任务，并争取在今后三年内水产生产能有更大的发展，同时，加速实现水产生产的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。
    这是一个持续跃进的计划，任务当然是繁重的，但是，只要我们坚决依靠党、大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命，以及贯彻执行水产生产的两条腿走路的方针，完成这个任务也是完全可能的。事实上，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，党的总路线是更加深入人心了；各地党委、人委更加重视和加强了对水产事业的领导，国家给予水产的支援更多了；经过整风整社，人民公社日益发挥出它强大的威力，并在发展多种经营中，普遍重视了渔业的发展；水产生产已有了一套两条腿走路的方针和增产措施，干部和群众也有了两年大跃进的丰富经验，所有这些，都是我们完成任务的有利条件，可以说，现在发展水产的条件，无论在政治上、组织上、技术上、物质上，都比过去任何时期更为有利。
    为了全面实现上述规划，我们要着重做好下面的几点工作。
    第一，开展机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的技术革新和技术革命运动。目前水产生产，绝大部分还是手工操作，占用的劳力多，而劳动生产率低，这是和社会主义建设高速度发展的要求不相适应的，今后，单纯靠增加劳力来增加产量，显然是不可能的。因此，必须通过技术革新和技术革命，过渡到机械化和半机械化，从而大大提高劳动生产率。水产的技术革新和技术革命运动，要从生产实际出发，以工具改革为重点，采取洋土结合、土中出洋的办法，三年内，首先基本实现海洋捕捞生产的机帆化，并努力做到渔网尼龙化、生产指挥电讯化、作业常年化、品种多样化、淡水捕捞和海、淡水养殖生产的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化；我们也准备根据条件积极进行，并注意结合农业的机械化来考虑，尽量使机械设备能够综合利用。其他养殖和捕捞的高产技术，养殖良种的培育，中层鱼类的捕捞，声、光、电在渔业上的运用等，也都积极研究试验，使我国的水产技术迅速向高（级）、精（密）、尖（端）及水产的综合利用发展。我们要广泛发动群众，展开声势浩大的技术革命运动。水产科学研究工作，干部的培养训练，也都以此为中心任务。
    第二，全面发展城乡渔业。根据人民公社农、林、牧、副、渔五业并举的方针，大力组织公社中渔业的专业队伍和副业队伍，进行常年和季节性的、商品性和自给性的养殖和捕捞生产，争取有条件的地区社社产鱼，提高商品量，增加公社积累，改善社员生活，支援农业发展。根据城市副食品自力更生为主，力争外援为辅的方针，积极发展城区渔业，争取逐步做到城区水产品基本自给。在城区发展渔业有利的条件很多，城区的水面一般较多、它水质肥、饵料充足；人力、物力、财力、技术和机器设备方面，也都比农村容易解决，优先发展城区渔业，可以进一步带动农村渔业的发展。
    第三，积极建立渔业基地。采取洋土并举，大中小并举（小型为主）的方针，争取三年内建成沿海和内陆集中产区的渔业基地。基地建设以支持生产为中心，修建防浪堤、航标、灯塔、码头、仓库、修造船厂、绳网厂等生产和安全设备。同时，为了掌握更多的商品鱼，进一步改善城市、工矿、林牧区的市场供应和增加出口，也要建设必要的冷藏加工厂等。
    第四，我国东北、西北、西南地方内陆水域丰富，水产资源多未开发，根据就地生产，就地供应的方针，除了更高速度地发展较有基础地区的水产生产外，我们要积极发展东北、西北、西南等地区的水产事业。这些地区，不少地方水面大，鱼类蕴藏丰富，真是“棒打獐子瓢舀鱼”，但是现在还很少甚至没有进行生产，这些地区发展的前途很大，发展起来以后，不仅产量可以大大增加，而且可以根本改变我国水产的分布状况，那时，除了少数特种水产品需要适当地调运供应全国外，一般地不再南鱼北运，东鱼西调。
    第五，继续贯彻以鱼为主的多种经营和渔、农、林、牧、副的综合经营。我们要进一步扩大水产生产的品种。鱼类的品种要扩大，鱼类以外的贝类、介类、藻类也要扩大，其他经济价值高，用途广的水生动植物都要发展。水产是农、林、牧、副、渔五业中的一业，因此，不仅要扩大水产本身的品种，而且要利用一切可能利用的水面、土地，进行渔、农、林、牧、副的综合经营，尤其是发展蚕桑畜牧、种麻栽竹等为水产服务的生产。有些地区以水生植物养猪，用猪粪肥水养鱼，以塘泥鱼粪肥田的循环利用，大大地降低了成本，增加了收入，“一亩池塘一头猪”的经验，近来已有很多地区采用，我们正在大力推广。
    第六，做好供销工作。根据人民公社自给性生产与商品性生产同时并举的方针，水产供销工作要大力支持生产，促进公社增加商品量，以保证城市、工矿、林牧区的供应和出口的需要。近来水产品上市量虽有增加，但和生产增长幅度相比，国家直接调拨的商品量还比较少。因此，水产供销部门，对集中产区和分散产区，对大水产品和小水产品，都要加强收购工作；同时，要加强对渔民提高商品率、增加公共积累、扩大再生产的思想教育，组织好渔需生产资料和生活资料的供应，增加收购量。
    各位代表：在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，广大渔民和全体水产职工的辛勤劳动，以及各方面的协作，水产事业取得了伟大的成就，但是，在我们的工作中缺点还很多。各位代表在历次视察工作中，提出了很多宝贵的意见，给予我们很大的鼓舞，这对改进我们的工作，进一步发展水产事业，起了很大的作用。我诚恳地希望各位代表经常地给我们更多的指导。水产生产的大发展，也是和商业、气象、铁道、交通、民航等有关部门的大力支持分不开的，特别是人民海军捍卫海防，保护渔业生产，更给予我们以莫大的帮助。在这里我谨向日日夜夜奋战在海洋上的人民子弟兵致以亲切的慰问。
    最近，中共中央和国务院发布关于做好渔业春汛生产工作的指示，对整个水产战线是一个莫大的鼓舞。现在夺取春汛丰收大战的序幕已经揭开，海洋上的渔民生产大军辛苦勤劳比往年提早十五天到一个月整队出海；淡水方面也掀起了大建鱼池、大抓苗种、大搞捕捞的生产热潮；海水养殖队伍也都已经在各个战线上行动起来；这一切良好的开端，都预示着今年水产事业更大更好更全面的跃进。我们一定要在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓起更大的干劲，开展蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，乘风破浪，胜利前进。
