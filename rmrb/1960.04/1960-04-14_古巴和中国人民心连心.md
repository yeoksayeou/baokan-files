Cuban Correspondence

    The Hearts of the Cuban and Chinese People are Linked
    Pang Bing'an
    In Cuba, people call China a distant neighbor and regard the Chinese people as their loyal friends. Recently, Cuban friends who have visited China, no matter where they go after returning to their country, are immediately surrounded by people who ask them countless questions about China. They have given many reports on China at the invitation of workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, and soldiers, conveying the friendship of the Chinese people to the Cuban people, and praising China's great achievements.
    Cuban friends warmly praised China's General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Marinello, Chairman of the People's Socialist Party, said: A visit to the People's Republic of China can most completely and flawlessly prove the truth of Marxism-Leninism and the wisdom of the Communist Party and government leaders of the most populous country in the world. They have gradually achieved amazing changes. In 1960, China will continue to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. In a few years, China will become a model of an economically and culturally advanced country.
    The road that leads Chinese peasants to happiness attracts the Cuban people, who are overcoming all the threats and sabotage of the US imperialists and are enthusiastically carrying out land reform and realizing cooperation. Peasant leader Antero Regalado said: "Anyone who is upright and knows a little about China's long history, as long as he visits this great country, then among his many pleasant impressions there must be the Great Leap Forward that he has personally seen in the transformation of agriculture and the improvement of peasants' lives."
    Luis Simon, a leader of the electrical workers, praised the achievements of the Chinese workers in the Great Leap Forward. He said: "China has only been liberated for ten years, but all the production targets during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule have been greatly exceeded."
    The Cuban people, who are fighting heroically for economic independence and against US imperialist aggression, yearn for the path and achievements of China's socialist construction. Guillers Jimenez, Director of the "Combat Newspaper," the organ of the Revolutionary Guidance Committee, and a major in the rebel army, said: "The Chinese people today are united and happy, and they are advancing along the road indicated by socialist theory. What encourages us Cubans is that a country like China, despite being blockaded by the monopoly capital groups that are trying to stifle our revival today, has still achieved great achievements in economic construction." In their own struggle against US imperialist aggression, the Cuban people see in the victory of the Chinese people that imperialism is a paper tiger, which increases their courage to fight and strengthens their confidence in victory. As the famous poet Guillen said: "China's example tells us that imperialism is not invincible." The Cuban people support the people of all countries in the world with their own struggles, and at the same time cherish the support of China and the people of other countries in the world. Marinello, Chairman of the People's Socialist Party, said: "The visit to New China moved me in many ways. One of them is the strong support that the Chinese people give to the people of all countries in the world, especially to the people of all countries who, like China in the past, are fighting against imperialist oppression. China's fraternal support for the Cuban revolution is extremely sincere." Marinello also said: "The leaders of the Chinese people know that equal and mutually beneficial trade will be a great support for the Cuban people's heroic struggle against imperialism and its domestic and foreign allies. Their determination to conduct beneficial trade is clear and firm. As for the Chinese people, as long as the name of Cuba is mentioned, they can get their understanding and support. The Chinese people deeply love everything that our revolution has done and is doing."
    There are many bookstores and newsstands in Havana that sell Chinese-published books and magazines in Spanish. Chairman Mao's works, books on China's agricultural cooperation, industrialization, and people's communes are always quickly sold out. "People's Pictorial" and "China Reconstructs" are often circulated from family to family.
    The Chinese feature film "Mother" and the documentary about the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which were shown in cinemas and on television, were warmly welcomed by the Cuban people. The cinemas are always full. These films are currently being shown in Santiago. An old man said: "I have been deceived by American propaganda about China for decades. After watching this film of China's National Day, the curtain that prevented me from seeing the real situation in China was lifted. I saw that the Chinese people are so happy, and it is impossible to force a country's people to show happiness. Such people must be our friends."
    Geographical distance cannot hinder the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people. As time goes by, the friendship between the two peoples will surely achieve further development.

### 古巴和中国人民心连心

    古巴和中国人民心连心	庞炳庵
    在古巴，人们把中国称为远方的邻国，把中国人民看作自己忠实的朋友。最近访问过中国的古巴朋友一回到祖国，不管走到哪里，人们都立即把他们包围起来，向他们提出关于中国的无数问题。他们应工人、农民、知识分子、妇女和士兵的邀请作了许许多多关于中国的报告，转达了中国人民对古巴人民的友谊，并且赞扬了中国的巨大成就。
    古巴的朋友们热情地称赞中国建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。人民社会党主席马里内略说：对中华人民共和国进行一次访问就可以最完整无缺地证明马克思列宁主义真理和这个世界上人口最多的国家中共产党及政府领导人的智慧。他们已经逐步实现了惊人的变革。1960年，中国将在1958年和1959年大跃进的基础上，继续大跃进。几年之后，中国将成为一个经济上和文化上先进国家的典范。
    引导中国农民走向幸福的道路吸引着古巴人民，他们正在战胜美帝国主义者的一切威胁和破坏，轰轰烈烈地进行着土地改革和实现合作化。农民领导人安特罗·雷加拉多说：“任何正直的和对中国的悠久历史稍有所知的人，只要访问一下这个伟大的国家，那么在他许多愉快的观感中一定有关于亲眼看到的在农业改造和农民生活提高方面所发生的大跃进。”
    电力工人领导人路易斯·西蒙赞扬了中国工人在大跃进中所取得的成就。他说：“中国解放才不过十年，可是日本和国民党统治时期的全部生产指标都已大大地超过了”。
    正为争取经济独立，反对美帝国主义侵略而英勇斗争的古巴人民，向往着中国社会主义建设的道路和成就。革命指导委员会机关报“战斗报”社长、起义军少校吉列尔斯·希门尼斯说：“今天的中国人民是团结和幸福的，他们沿着社会主义理论所指明的道路前进。使我们古巴人感到鼓舞的是，像中国这样一个国家，尽管受到今天力图扼杀我们的复兴的垄断资本集团的封锁，但是仍然在经济建设中获得了巨大的成就。”古巴人民在他们自己反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，在中国人民的胜利中看到，帝国主义是纸老虎，这就增加了他们斗争的勇气和加强了他们胜利的信心。正如著名诗人纪廉所说：“中国的范例告诉我们，帝国主义不是不可战胜的。”古巴人民以自己的斗争支援世界各国人民，同时也珍视中国和世界其他国家人民的支援。人民社会党主席马里内略说：“对新中国的访问使我在很多方面受到感动。其中之一就是中国人民对世界各国人民给予大力的支援，特别是对像中国过去一样正为反对帝国主义压迫而斗争的各国人民给予大力的支援。中国对古巴革命的兄弟般的支援是极其真诚的。”马里内略还说：“中国人民的领导人知道，平等互利的贸易，对古巴人民反对帝国主义及其国内外同盟者的英勇斗争将是极大的支持。他们准备进行有益的贸易的决心是明显而坚定的。至于说到中国人民，只要提起古巴的名字，就可以得到他们的了解和支援。中国人民深深地热爱我国革命已经做的和正在做的一切。”
    哈瓦那有很多书店和报摊出售中国出版的西班牙文书籍和杂志。毛主席的著作，关于中国农业合作化、工业化和人民公社化的书籍，总是很快就卖光。“人民画报”和“中国建设”常常是被一家家的传阅。
    电影院和电视台放映的中国故事片“母亲”和关于中华人民共和国建国十周年大典的纪录片，受到古巴人民的热烈欢迎。电影院总是场场满座。这些影片目前正在圣地亚哥放映。一位老人说：“我被美国关于中国的宣传欺骗了几十年。看了中国国庆的这部影片，就揭开了使我看不到中国真实情况的那块幕布。我看到，中国人民是那样的愉快，而要强迫一国人民表现出愉快是办不到的。这样的人民肯定是我们的朋友。”
    地理上的遥远距离阻碍不了中国人民和古巴人民之间的友谊。随着时间的推移，两国人民的友谊必将会获得更进一步的发展。
