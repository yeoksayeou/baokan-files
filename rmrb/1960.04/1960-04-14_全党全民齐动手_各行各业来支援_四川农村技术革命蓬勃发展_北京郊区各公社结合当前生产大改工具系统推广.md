Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 11th: A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on semi-mechanization and mechanization is vigorously unfolding in rural Sichuan. This movement is developing rapidly along a correct, scientific, and national path. Currently, more than sixty counties across the province have achieved transportation vehicle-ization; many counties, districts, and communes basically use semi-mechanized and indigenous-mechanized tools for water lifting, agricultural product processing, and some crop cultivation; 70% of large- and medium-sized water conservancy projects under construction have achieved semi-mechanized construction; and a large number of pig farms and canteens have replaced tedious and heavy manual labor with semi-mechanized tools.

At present, the situation of technical innovation and technical revolution in rural Sichuan is extremely good. The vast numbers of cadres and masses are highly motivated, and many advanced areas have seen a warm scene of the whole Party and the entire people acting together, and all trades and professions carrying out great innovations from the very beginning. The tool reform movement has rapidly developed from mainly improvement to centering on semi-mechanization, from single-item tool reform to complete sets of reforms, and from agriculture to forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as pig raising and canteens. According to typical investigations in Neijiang, Nanchong, and other areas, the number of semi-mechanized tools in tool reform in various places has increased by more than double compared to last year. In vast areas, agricultural machinery scientific research organizations have also been generally established at all levels, and mass research work has been carried out closely in conjunction with technical innovation and technical revolution. According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of this year, more than two hundred types of semi-mechanized, indigenous-mechanized, and improved tools have been created in various parts of the province, with nearly two million pieces manufactured and promoted, more than double the same period last year.

The semi-mechanization and mechanization movement in rural Sichuan has developed on the basis of the mass tool reform movement carried out in the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Since 1958, more than a thousand kinds of improved tools have been created, modified, and imitated throughout the province, with more than fourteen million pieces manufactured and promoted. Local agricultural tool manufacturing and repair networks have been basically established, a large number of technical personnel have been trained, and rich experience has been accumulated. Therefore, since last year, the number of semi-mechanized tools created and produced in various places has been increasing day by day. When the Party put forward the call to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, it greatly encouraged the people of the whole province, and the tool reform movement quickly turned to a new stage centered on gradually realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization. Since the end of last year, agricultural machinery conferences have been held at all levels throughout the province to evaluate and finalize tool designs, formulate plans, arrange production, and propose this year's tasks. Many counties and communes have put forward: "We must strive to achieve semi-mechanization this year!" Subsequently, institutions were generally established in various places, and full-time cadres were assigned, so that the movement was quickly and systematically carried out throughout the province.

According to the current rural conditions, Sichuan adheres to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods in the agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization movement, starting from indigenous and moving towards foreign, and using indigenous methods to get started. The general approach is: use foreign methods if possible, use indigenous methods if possible, criticize the idea of a few people who sit and wait for mechanization and look down on indigenous methods, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, comprehensively reform, systematically reform, and vigorously carry out "one-dragon" supporting reforms, thereby giving full play to and utilizing existing manpower and material resources, and greatly accelerating the speed of the movement. When Wusheng County reformed pig-raising tools, there were no "foreign machines" available, but due to the use of indigenous methods, the masses were mobilized to create, modify, and introduce more than sixty kinds of indigenous tools. Finally, more than ten kinds of tools were selected from more than ten aspects such as feed processing, transportation, and drinking water, and matched into a "one-dragon," including indigenous water pumps, indigenous running water, feed transportation vehicles, and combined cooking stoves. In just a few months, the appearance of pig farms throughout the county was changed, and more than 800 large pig farms in the county have achieved semi-mechanization. In the reform of water lifting tools in Gantang Commune, Kaijiang County, on the one hand, water pumps were actively installed, and on the other hand, bamboo and wood water lifting tools were greatly reformed, and more than 390 indigenous water pumps and improved waterwheels driven by human power, animal power, and water power were successively created, realizing semi-mechanization.

In order to ensure tool quality and accelerate manufacturing and large-scale promotion, Sichuan has also made vigorously arming county and commune agricultural tool factories a very important measure. As early as the winter of 1958, various parts of the province carried out a vigorous "Three-Five" movement according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, requiring that each county, district, and part of the people's communes' agricultural tool factories be equipped with five machine tools, and each commune and part of the production teams have five major tools such as tap and die sets, bench vises, hacksaws, steel files, and steel drills, and widely use five kinds of power such as water, fire, animal, wind, and gas (natural gas, biogas). At present, more than 14,000 indigenous and foreign machine tools and more than 140,000 pieces of five kinds of tools have been manufactured throughout the province, equipping more than 26,000 agricultural tool factories and repair stations. Many semi-mechanized tools that were only produced in a few cities in the past can now be produced in the vast countryside. In Neijiang Prefecture, where the "Three-Five" movement has developed well, the semi-mechanized and improved tools manufactured in the first quarter of this year increased four times compared to the same period last year, and many machines such as blowers, motors, and water pumps have also been manufactured.

Party committees at all levels in Sichuan have strengthened political and ideological work in the movement, and at the same time established models, carried out socialist labor competitions of "compare, learn, catch up, and help," and promoted the comprehensive development of the movement. Many prefectures such as Luzhou, Jiangjin, and Wenjiang have established key counties and communes for semi-mechanization at all levels, opened on-site meetings, and promoted advanced experiences and inventions. The recent on-site meetings held by various counties in Neijiang Prefecture have been held more than a hundred times, which not only promoted the rapid catching up of backward areas with advanced areas, popularized the advanced level, but also greatly promoted advanced areas and units to have more inventions. In Tongjiang County, more than 10,000 technical innovation pioneers emerged through the competition, driving the agricultural semi-mechanization movement in the county to quickly form a high tide.

This newspaper reports: An agricultural technical transformation movement centered on the innovation of production tools is forming a climax in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs. Since the beginning of spring, a large number of reformed semi-mechanized tools and large-scale agricultural machinery have been widely used in the suburbs, greatly improving agricultural labor conditions and improving labor productivity.

This year, the tool reform in the suburbs of Beijing has been closely integrated with production tasks, and deployments and arrangements have been made early with leadership and planning. The people's communes and production brigades in the suburbs have special organizations or have set up professional personnel to strengthen leadership over this work. The reform projects not only include field crops, vegetables, and animal husbandry, but also develop from production tools to living welfare tools. The main processes of early spring agricultural activities such as water conservancy projects and leveling land, hauling manure and transporting fertilizer, and vegetable sowing basically have more successful new tools. A quarter of the pig farms in the suburbs have fully or partially realized "fourizations" (feed processing mechanization, transportation vehicle-ization, water self-flowing, and dining hall feeding). Among the 11,000 rural canteens in the city, 6,000 have carried out cooker reform, of which nearly 800 canteens have initially achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized operation.

This year, the movement to reform production tools in the suburbs has absorbed the experience of the past few years, and at the beginning, the past method of reforming and promoting single items has been changed to batch production and systematic promotion in stages and sections according to agricultural seasons and production needs. The county (district) committees, while deploying agricultural production, uniformly arrange the manufacturing and promotion of new tools required in the next stage, so that they can be used in a timely manner and achieve quick results. In the land leveling work, Huairou County synthesized the advantages of several land leveling tools and made a land leveler suitable for the soil conditions of the county. The commune factories produced them in batches, and in only seventeen days, more than 300 units were promoted throughout the county, and two-thirds of the county's land leveling task was completed in nine days.

The tool reform movement in some areas has begun to develop in the direction of serialization. Some reservoir engineering teams have formed a set of construction tools from excavation, loading, transportation, unloading to rolling on the dam. Tools for crops such as corn, rice, and sweet potatoes from land preparation and sowing to harvesting and processing can also be matched into sets, except for a few links.

A new situation of developing from indigenous to foreign and towards mechanization has emerged in the tool reform movement. Among the tools created and promoted this year, there are already many high-quality and effective semi-mechanized agricultural tools. Changping County has manufactured a tractor-drawn ridging machine. A flexible cultivator, which is a modification of a weeding hoe and has been recently promoted throughout the city, can also be used as a machine-drawn cultivator. For the machine-drawn tools required for vegetable field production, a set of land preparation, ridging, furrowing, and sowing machines has now been researched and trial-produced, many of which have been successfully modified on the basis of wooden improved tools.

In order to push the tool innovation movement to a new stage, party organizations and relevant leading departments at all levels in Beijing are currently conducting a general survey, evaluation, and finalization of tools. At present, each county (district) has already established or is preparing to establish professional research institutions for agricultural machinery and tools, so as to form an agricultural machinery research network in the suburbs as soon as possible.

    全党全民齐动手  各行各业来支援
    四川农村技术革命蓬勃发展
    北京郊区各公社结合当前生产大改工具系统推广
    新华社成都11日电　四川农村以半机械化、机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃展开。这个运动正沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道向前飞速发展。现在全省实现运输车子化的县已达六十个以上；许多县、区和公社提水、农产品加工和部分农作物耕作基本上使用了半机械化和土机械化工具；正在施工的大、中型水利工程有70％实现了半机械化施工；大批猪场、食堂，以半机械化工具代替了过去繁琐、笨重的手工劳动。
    目前，四川农村技术革新和技术革命的形势极好。广大干部和群众干劲高涨，许多先进地区一开始就出现了全党全民齐动手、各行各业大革新的热烈景象。工具改革运动由以改良为主迅速发展到以半机械化为中心，由单项工具改革发展到成套改革，由农业发展到林、牧、副、渔以至养猪、食堂等各个方面。据内江、南充等专区典型调查，各地工具改革中半机械化工具比去年增加一倍以上。广大地区还普遍建立了各级农业机械科学研究组织，紧密结合技术革新和技术革命开展了群众性的研究工作。根据不完全统计，今年以来全省各地创造的半机械化、土机械化和改良工具达二百多种，制造推广近二百多万件，比去年同期增加一倍多。
    四川省农村半机械化、机械化运动是在过去几年来，特别是大跃进以来开展群众性的工具改革运动的基础上发展起来的。1958年以来，全省创造、改制、仿制的各种改良工具就达千种以上，制造推广了一千四百多万件，并基本上建立了地方农具制造、修配网，培养出大批技术力量，积累了丰富的经验。因此，从去年起，各地创造和生产的半机械化工具就日益增多。当党提出加速实现农业机械化的号召后，大大鼓舞了全省人民，工具改革运动迅速转入了以逐步实现半机械化、机械化为中心的新阶段。去年年底以来，全省各地都层层召开农业机械会议，进行工具的评选、定型，制定规划，安排生产，提出今年任务。许多县、社纷纷提出：“一定争取今年实现半机械化！”接着，各地普遍建立了机构，配置专职干部，使运动迅速而有计划地在全省开展起来。
    根据当前农村条件，四川各地在农业半机械化、机械化运动中坚持土洋并举的方针，由土到洋，用土法上马。一般做法是：能洋就洋，能土就土，批判了少数人的坐等机械化和看不起土办法的思想，因地制宜，就地取材，全面改，系统改，大搞“一条龙”配套改革，从而充分发挥和运用了现有的人力、物力，大大加快了运动的速度。武胜县改革养猪工具时没有任何“洋机器”可用，但由于用土办法，发动群众创造、改制和引进的各种土工具就达六十多种，最后从饲料加工、运输、饮水等十多个方面选出十几种工具，配成“一条龙”，其中有土抽水机、土自来水、运饲料车、连锅灶等，仅几个月时间就改变了全县猪场的面貌，全县八百多个大型养猪场已经实现了半机械化。开江县甘棠公社改革提水工具中，一方面积极安装抽水机，一方面大搞竹、木提水工具改革，先后创造成了三百九十多部用人力、畜力、水力带动的土抽水机和改良水车，实现了半机械化。
    为了保证工具质量和加速制造，大量推广，四川各地还把大力武装县、社农具厂做为一项十分重大的措施。早从1958年冬天起，全省各地就按照省委指示开展了热火朝天的“三五”运动，要求每个县、区和部分人民公社的农具厂配备五部机床，每个公社和部分生产队拥有套丝板、老虎钳、钢锯、钢锉、钢钻等五大件工具，并广泛利用水、火、畜、风、气（天然气、沼气）等五种动力。目前全省各地制成的土洋机床已达一万四千多台，五种工具十四万多件，装备了二万六千多个农具厂和修配站。许多过去只有少数城市生产的半机械化工具，现在广大乡村都可以生产。“三五”运动发展较好的内江专区，今年一季度制造的半机械化和改良工具就比去年同期增加了四倍，还造出了鼓风机、马达、水泵等许多机具。
    四川各级党委在运动中加强了政治思想工作，同时大树标兵，开展“比、学、超、帮”的社会主义劳动竞赛，推动运动全面发展。泸州、江津、温江等许多专区都层层建立了半机械化的重点县、社，广开现场会，推广先进经验和发明创造。内江专区各县最近召开的各级现场会就在一百次以上，不仅促进了后进地区迅速赶上先进地区，普及了先进水平，也大大推动了先进地区和单位有更多的发明创造。通江县通过竞赛涌现了一万多技术革新尖兵，带动全县农业半机械化运动很快形成热潮。
    本报讯　一个以革新生产工具为中心的农业技术改造运动，正在北京郊区农村形成高潮。入春以来，大批经过改革的半机械化工具和大型农业机械一起在郊区广泛使用，大大改善了农业劳动条件，提高了劳动生产率。
    今年北京郊区的工具改革，紧密结合生产任务有领导有计划地及早作了部署和安排。郊区各人民公社和生产大队都有专门机构或设置了专业人员，加强对这一工作的领导。改革的项目不仅包括大田作物、蔬菜、畜牧业，而且从生产工具发展到生活福利工具。水利工程和平整土地、倒粪运肥、蔬菜播种等早春农事活动的主要工序，基本上都有了比较成功的新工具。全郊区已经有四分之一的养猪场全部或部分地实现了“四化”（饲料加工机械化、运输车子化、用水自流化、喂食食堂化）。全市一万一千个农村食堂中有六千个进行了炊具改革，其中有近八百个食堂初步达到操作机械化和半机械化。
    今年郊区改革生产工具运动吸取了几年来的经验，一开始就把过去单项单件改革推广的办法改变为按农时季节，生产需要分期分段成批生产、系统推广。各县（区）委在部署农业生产的同时，统一安排下一阶段所需新工具的制造、推广工作，作到了及时使用、收效快。怀柔县在平整土地工作中，综合几种平地工具的优点，制成适合本县土壤条件的平地器，由公社工厂成批制造，仅十七天时间全县就推广了三百多部，九天时间完成了全县平地任务的三分之二。
    一部分地区的工具改革运动开始向系列化的方向发展，有的水库工程队挖装运卸到上坝碾轧已组成一套施工工具。玉米、水稻、白薯等作物从整地播种到收获加工的工具，除少数环节以外，也可以配成套。
    工具改革运动中出现了由土到洋，向机械化方向发展的新情况。在今年创制推广的工具中已经有不少质量高、收效大的半机械化农具。昌平县制成了拖拉机牵引打埂机。最近在全市推广的一种用耘锄改装的灵便中耕器，也可以用作机引中耕工具。对菜田生产所需的机引工具，现在研究试制出一套整地、打埂、起垅、播种机具，其中不少是在木制改良工具基础上改制成功的。
    为了把工具革新运动推向一个新的阶段，北京市各级党组织和有关领导部门，目前正在对工具进行普查、评选、定型工作，目前各县（区）已经或正在筹建农业机具的专业研究机构，以便及早组成郊区的农业机具研究网。
