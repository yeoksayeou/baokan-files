    Hubei Achieves Large-Area Balanced Production Increase
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently sent a letter to rural cadres and farmers throughout the province to discuss the issue of large-area balanced production increase.
    The Provincial Committee believes that balance requires that crops in all communes, production teams, and production brigades grow roughly the same, with a relatively high average yield per unit area; that is, the backward should learn from the advanced, rather than pulling the advanced down to the level of the backward. The Provincial Committee raised three questions for everyone to discuss: 1. Why is large-area balanced production increase particularly important? 2. What constitutes balanced production increase? 3. How to achieve large-area balanced production increase?
    The slogan put forward by the Provincial Committee in this letter is: Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive for large-area balanced production increase to fight for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1960!
    Shaanxi Launches Over-Quota Production Campaign
    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a call to farmers throughout the province to launch a spring production campaign to exceed plans and exceed quotas. The Provincial Committee believes that April is a crucial month for spring production, and the following central tasks must be grasped:
    1. Vigorously grasp water and fertilizer to ensure that summer crops have enough to eat and drink, and strive to make third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings.
    2. Vigorously prevent wheat rust and other pests; prevent frost in a timely manner; take early action to prevent wheat lodging.
    3. Crops planned for planting must be sown in a timely manner and planted sufficiently and well.
    4. Prepare for summer harvesting tools.
    In order to achieve the above requirements, the Provincial Committee believes that it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, launch mass movements, and implement plans, implement measures, and implement responsibilities at all levels.
    Heilongjiang Vigorously Establishes State-Run Pig Farms
    Heilongjiang Province has adopted the method of establishing pig farms at the provincial, special district, and county levels, with agricultural and commercial departments working together to rapidly form a demonstration base network for state-run pig production. At present, there are 357 large state-run pig farms in the province, raising a total of 650,000 pigs, an increase of three times compared to the beginning of 1959. Among the 650,000 pigs, 80% are superior breeds such as Haba, Suba, and Yorkshire, which are cold-resistant, can eat coarse feed, have high litter rates, and fatten quickly.
    Henan Promotes Artificial Smoke to Prevent Frost
    Yancheng County, Henan, has successfully created an artificial smoke frost prevention cannon. The smoke emitted by this frost prevention cannon can effectively gather for up to 83 minutes. During frost, as long as two frost prevention cannons are continuously ignited, the artificial smoke can protect 23 mu of wheat from frost. At present, this simple to manufacture, low-cost, widely available, and effective frost prevention cannon has been widely promoted throughout the province.
    Tuochuan Commune Vigorously Develops Transportation
    The Tuochuan People's Commune in Jiangxi Province used seven days and nights to build 15 simple roads with a total length of 32 li, 274 bullock cart tracks with a total length of 219 li, and 900 meters of light soil railway, forming a transportation network that extends in all directions to the commune's main agricultural production bases.
    The transportation network has played a huge role in this spring's preparations for farming. Compared with carrying fertilizer by shoulder where there are no roads, the commune's early rice fertilizer accumulation and transportation, using vehicles where there are roads, reduced labor days from 588,000 to more than 96,000, and reduced the time from the past 70 days to 23 days. Low-yielding fields that could not be transported with fertilizer in the past can now be heavily fertilized. The commune's transportation network has also abolished many underutilized small roads and field ridges, increasing the arable area of farmland for the entire commune.
    Langshan Commune Establishes a Record of Minor Spring Fine Varieties
    In order to select and retain fine varieties in a planned manner, the Langshan Commune in Jiangjin County, Sichuan, has launched a mass campaign to select and retain seeds. All management districts have universally established records of fine varieties and variety pedigrees. Now, this commune has conducted field surveys of minor spring crops by variety and plot, and then designated seed fields, inserted markers, assigned special personnel for management; the contents of the fine variety records and variety pedigrees include: crop variety name, planting area, estimated yield per unit area, sowing period, growth period, heading period, maturity period, resistance to disease, insects, and lodging, as well as suitable growing soil, and seed selection opinions (select all or select part), etc.

    要闻快报
    湖北搞大面积平衡增产
    中共湖北省委最近给全省农村干部和农民一封信，讨论大面积平衡增产的问题。
    省委认为，平衡就是要求各个公社、生产队、生产小队的作物大体上都长得一样好，平均单产比较高；也就是落后向先进看齐，而不是把先进的拉下来向落后的看齐。省委提出了三个问题，希望大家讨论：一、大面积平衡增产为什么特别重要？二、怎样才算平衡增产？三、如何去实现大面积平衡增产？
    省委在这封信中提出的口号是：学先进、赶先进、争取大面积平衡增产，为实现1960年农业生产更大跃进而战！
    陕西开展超包产运动
    中共陕西省委最近向全省农民发出开展超计划、超包产的春季生产运动。省委认为4月是春季生产的关键月，必须抓紧以下几项中心工作：
    一、狠抓水肥，要使夏田作物吃足喝饱，务使三类苗赶上一类苗。
    二、大力防治麦锈病和其他虫害；及时防霜冻；早动手防小麦倒伏。
    三、计划播种作物一定要适时下种，种足种好。
    四、做好夏收工具准备。
    为了实现上述要求，省委认为必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动；要做到落实计划、落实措施，并层层落实责任。
    黑龙江大办国营养猪场
    黑龙江省采取了省、专区、县三级建养猪场，农业和商业部门一齐动手的方法，迅速形成国营养猪生产示范基地网。目前全省已有国营大型养猪场三百五十七个，共养猪六十五万头，比1959年年初增加了三倍。六十五万头猪中，有80％是耐寒、耐吃粗饲料、产仔率高、育肥快的哈白、苏白、约克夏等优良品种。
    河南推广人造烟雾防霜冻
    河南偃城县创制成功人工烟雾防霜炮，这种防霜炮喷吐的烟雾有效聚拢时间达八十三分钟。在降霜时间，只要连续点燃两个防霜炮，人造的烟雾可控制二十三亩小麦不受霜冻。目前，这种制造简单、成本低、原料广、效果大的防霜炮已在全省普遍推广。
    拖船公社大办交通
    江西拖船人民公社用七昼夜时间，建成总长三十二里长的十五条简易公路，二百一十九里长的牛车道二百七十四条，轻便土火车道九百米，使全社主要农业生产基地形成了四通八达的交通网。
    交通网在今春的备耕工作中发挥了巨大作用。全社早稻积肥运肥，用有路车子化和无路肩挑相比，劳动日由五十八万八千个减少到九万六千多个，时间由过去的七十天减到二十三天，过去因为路远运不去肥料的低产田，可以大施肥料了。公社交通网还废除了许多使用率低的小道和田塍道，为全社增加了农田耕作面积。
    瑯山公社建立小春良种志
    为了有计划选留良种，四川江津县瑯山公社展开了群众性的选种、留种工作，各管理区普遍建立了良种志、品种谱。现在这个公社已经对小春作物分品种逐块进行田间普查，然后定好种子田，插标作记，专人管理；良种志、品种谱记载内容包括：作物品种名称、种植面积、预计单产量、播种期、生长期、抽穗期、成熟期、抗病抗虫抗倒伏性能以及适宜生长的土壤、选种意见（全部选或部分选）等。
