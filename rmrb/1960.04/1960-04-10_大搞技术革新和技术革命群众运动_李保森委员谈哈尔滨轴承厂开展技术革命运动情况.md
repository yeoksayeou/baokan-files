Launch a mass movement for technological innovation and technical revolution.
Committee member Li Baosen discusses the technical revolution movement carried out by the Harbin Bearing Factory

Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Report on the Work of The Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and will resolutely implement them in future work.

    Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on the technical revolution movement in the Harbin Bearing Factory and my personal superficial experience. Please criticize and correct any inadequacies.

    The Tide of the Technical Revolution Movement is Like Ten Thousand Horses Galloping, The Momentum is Huge, and Good News is Constantly Coming
    Under the brilliant light of the General Line, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the ministry and bureau, the Harbin Bearing Factory adhered to putting politics in command, launched a mass movement on a large scale, and extensively and deeply carried out a production increase and conservation movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. After the provincial party committee’s Jiamusi on-site conference, especially after the municipal party committee held a production automation line conference at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and the First Ministry of Machinery Industry held a Heilongjiang on-site conference, the factory's employees enthusiastically responded to the Party’s call and launched a mechanical, semi-mechanical, automated, and semi-automated technical revolution movement in the form of a "production sports meeting." It was like ten thousand horses galloping, the momentum was huge. All the factory's employees, from workshops to offices, from workers to cadres, threw themselves into this vigorous and popular technical revolution movement with the energy of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking. Good news was constantly coming, and people were excited. In the recent five or six months, the factory's employees have proposed tens of thousands of technical innovation projects, with an average of three projects realized per person. The factory has realized thirty-two automatic production lines, three hundred and sixty-one single-machine automation units, three hundred and ninety-six semi-automation units, one hundred and fifty-nine mechanized manual operations, twenty-five cutting-edge technologies, and twelve cutting-edge products.

    The realized automatic production lines vary in length, and some are indigenous while others are foreign. Most of them are formed by modifying the factory's original equipment using advanced technology. They have the characteristics of simple structure, convenient operation, low cost, and high efficiency. For example, the automatic line for machining 204-type ring lathes was modified from old lathes and presses. The processes were reduced from six to four, the output increased by 30%, the labor productivity increased three times, and the working area was saved by 32%.

    Single-machine automation and semi-automation are developing from points to areas. For many years, manual operations have been used, such as ring polishing, retainer stamping and deburring, surface quality inspection, size selection, typing, oiling, and packaging. Automation and semi-automation have been successfully tested, improving labor conditions. Now workers only need to press buttons and do some spot checks and adjustments within a certain period of time. One person can operate several machine tools easily and happily. The days of tense operation and sweating all day long are gone forever. Various machine tools are being automated, creating conditions for the further formation of automatic production lines.

    At present, in the auxiliary workshops of our factory, filing, fitting, scraping, grinding, sawing, deburring and other operations, pneumatic tools are widely used, and the mechanization of fitters has been basically achieved. In-plant transportation has been changed from carrying baskets and handcarts to battery cars. Railway and automobile loading and unloading have begun to use various indigenous and foreign lifting devices. The whole factory can basically eliminate manual operations before "July 1st".

    In terms of cutting-edge technology, our factory has initially successfully tested several chipless machining processes and is concentrating its efforts on further development, striving to eliminate or partially eliminate rough machining of blanks. The advanced technology of remote control has been further applied to the machine tools and machine clusters in the production workshop, and with the cooperation of television technology, it is advancing towards full automation of the entire workshop, even the entire factory.

    The technical revolution movement has greatly improved the development of productive forces, and effectively ensured that the factory completed the state plan two months ahead of schedule in 1959 and the first quarter of the state plan ten days ahead of schedule in 1960. Under the condition of increasing production without increasing personnel, it has created favorable conditions for the sustained leap forward in comprehensively overfulfilling the task in 1960.

    Carrying out the technical revolution movement is a way to develop production in a faster, better and more economical way.

    Facts show that carrying out mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation on a large scale is an effective way to develop production in a faster, better, and more economical way. From the perspective of our factory:

    First, it further increased output, improved quality, shortened the production cycle, and improved labor productivity. For example, the use of hot rolling technology for steel balls increased efficiency by eight times, labor productivity by six times, and the relative material utilization rate by about 10%.

    Second, it saves a lot of personnel, equipment, and workplaces, giving full play to the factory's production potential. For example, the whole factory has forty bearing ring polishing machines, which require a total of one hundred and twenty workers. After the full automation is realized in April, twenty polishing machines and thirty workers will be enough. When discussing the national plan this year, each workshop originally needed to increase the labor force by one thousand. After the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, not only is there no need to increase personnel, but also two hundred laborers can be drawn to supplement the new workshops.

    Third, it improves labor conditions and ensures safe production. For example, in the bearing ring polishing process, the old method required workers to stand and operate, half-squatting, moving their hands and feet together, and making more than 20,000 movements in eight hours; workers on the grooving lathe had to make more than 30,000 movements in eight hours, and the labor intensity was very high; manual operation of stamping retainers easily caused hand-pressing accidents; surface quality of steel balls and rollers was observed with the naked eye, and workers with long working years were prone to nearsightedness. Automation has completely solved these problems.

    Fourth, it promotes the continuous reform of enterprise management. With the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, it is urgently required to carry out continuous major reforms in production organization, systems, and management methods; otherwise, it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses and bind the development of productive forces. On the basis of consolidating and developing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," our factory has also realized the major reform of enterprise management of "one-ization, two dragons, and three combinations." "One-ization" refers to the institutionalization of leap-forward working methods, with a total of forty articles, replacing the old enterprise management rules and regulations; "two dragons" refers to the integrated system of production organization using closed workshops and closed production lines, and the integrated system of business management from departments to workshops, sections, and groups, with each profession forming a complete system from top to bottom; at the same time, the principle of combining centralized leadership with decentralized democratic management, one main and two secondary combinations, and three combinations inside and outside the factory is also implemented. Since its implementation, it has further strengthened the Party's leadership over the production base and mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Fifth, it promotes the cultural revolution movement. In order to adapt to the requirements of the technical revolution, the factory's employees urgently demanded to improve their theoretical level and cultural and technical level. A new upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought and studying culture has been launched in the factory, with an enrollment rate and attendance rate of over 90%. In addition to running political universities, spare-time middle schools, and spare-time universities on a large scale, the factory has also established a bearing engineering college, with majors such as bearing design and bearing technology. The first batch of students has already enrolled, thereby establishing a complete employee education system from low-level to high-level.

    Sixth, it accelerates the development of people's communes and vigorously supports the technical transformation of agriculture. Our factory is one of the backbone factories of the Xiangfang People's Commune. Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, it will support the technical transformation of community-run industry and agriculture by using some of the process equipment replaced by the technical revolution. For example, the community-run Satellite Bearing Factory, formerly a grass rope factory with dozens of workers, has developed into a factory with more than 600 workers and more than 60 machine tools after being supported by our factory. It plans to produce one million sets in 1960, becoming a force to be reckoned with. Our factory also organized engineering and technical personnel to use their spare time to help community-run factories with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation on a piece-by-piece basis, and also made full use of the factory's old materials and waste materials to support community-run industries, achieving comprehensive utilization of raw materials, so that the flowers of the technical revolution movement bloomed all over the people's communes.

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune

    The mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is an inevitable product of implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction, realizing the Great Leap Forward, and developing the People's Commune. As an engineering and technical personnel, I have received an extremely profound education in this great popular movement. The following are a few personal experiences:

    (1) The Party's absolute leadership is the fundamental guarantee of all victories. Technical work, like other work, must resolutely rely on the Party's leadership and implement the Party's line, principles, and policies in order to achieve great achievements and meet the requirements of socialist construction. The Party's line, principles, and policies are all formulated from the interests of the broad masses of the people, based on the laws of objective development, and considering the possibility of mobilizing all positive factors, so they are the most comprehensive, the most correct, and the most in line with the wishes of the broad masses of the people. For engineering and technical personnel to put politics in command, they must first absolutely listen to the Party's words, be the Party's tame tools, and fight wherever the Party points, so that they can better contribute their strength to socialist construction.

    (2) Conscientiously implementing the Party's complete set of guiding principles of walking on two legs can make the technical innovation and technical revolution movement a popular mass movement and achieve a high-speed leap forward. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the Harbin Bearing Factory resolutely implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, prioritizing indigenous methods over foreign methods; combining long-term and short-term plans, prioritizing short-term plans; combining large, medium, and small innovations; combining self-reliance as the main factor and striving for foreign aid; combining daring to think and daring to do with scientific analysis; and combining learning with originality. Therefore, in a short period of time, the enthusiasm and creativity of the factory's broad masses of employees were widely mobilized, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement swept the factory with the force of a landslide and tsunami, everyone started to work, striving to make contributions, focusing on the key and weak links of production, starting from the existing foundation, from low-level to high-level, from indigenous to foreign, from general reform to attacking cutting-edge technology, constantly revolutionizing, so that the movement continued to develop forward. For example, two automatic heat treatment lines for steel balls were completed in five days; the automatic line for machining 204-type ring lathes was successfully completed in less than 20 days from design to modification. These are all the results of implementing the Party's complete set of guiding principles of walking on two legs.

    (3) Actively participating in the technical revolution movement and closely integrating with the working masses is an important way to transform ideology. In the process of technical revolution, the struggle between advanced ideology and conservative ideology, and the struggle between the two roads of faster, better, and more economical and slower, worse, and more expensive, are always running through. This is also the struggle between two worldviews. While strengthening the study of Mao Zedong Thought, engineering and technical personnel actively participate in this great mass movement of technical revolution, so they can constantly break superstitions, liberate their minds, and break through various right-leaning conservative ideas such as "condition theory" and "mystery theory" through practice. They can rely on the Party's leadership and close integration with workers to gradually achieve putting politics in command, constantly transforming ideology, and improving political awareness, so as to better contribute their strength.

    For example, some comrades in the technical department of our factory did not solve ideological problems at the beginning of the technical revolution movement, and their work and movement could not cooperate well, and their integration with the masses was not close enough. After the Party Committee carried out meticulous ideological education, their ideological style immediately underwent great changes, and they realized thirteen major technical revolution projects in just one week. Through these facts, I deeply realized that: only when ideology is red, can the technical revolution be red. Therefore, the technical revolution movement is also a movement to accelerate the self-transformation of engineering and technical personnel.

    (4) Technical revolution must be based on the characteristics of the factory, explore the laws of development, and carry out comprehensive planning. The production characteristics of each enterprise are different. The production characteristics of our factory are: First, the product has high precision, simple structure, and similar geometric shape, so it is possible to divide it into several typical series according to the type of dimensional accuracy to realize serialization, which is convenient for organizing automation and continuous production. Second, there are many product varieties and large batches. According to statistical analysis, 80% of the output is concentrated on 20% of the varieties. Changing the production organization, treating large batches and multiple varieties separately, is convenient for determining the development direction of different process equipment. Third, the material utilization rate is low. For example, the utilization rate of holding blank is only 26% to 32%, and the utilization rate of forging blank is only 40% to 45%. At present, the weight of bearings using forging blank in our factory accounts for about 75% of the total product weight. It is necessary to improve the holding blank process and vigorously promote precision forging and other chipless machining processes. Fourth, accessories such as steel balls, rollers, and retainers can be produced separately, which is easy to develop into automatic workshops. Fifth, there are many types of machine tools, with both new and old existing. It is necessary to transform and utilize them according to their characteristics, so that they can each be used to their full potential. Sixth, there are many manual operations, such as polishing, inspection, selection, and assembly, which require the design and manufacture of automatic devices to reach the sky in one step and be closely integrated with the future automatic lines with foresight. Seventh, cutting-edge technology can be developed and applied on a large scale, and constantly consolidated and improved. Looking at the above characteristics, we must make a comprehensive plan, starting from the existing foundation, combining long-term and short-term plans, combining indigenous and foreign methods, long-term plans and short-term arrangements, unified leadership, combining top and bottom, and assigning responsibilities at all levels to carry out continuous revolution, which can not only ensure the realization of the plan, but also closely integrate with production.

    (5) "One main, two secondary, and three combinations" and carrying out communist cooperation on a large scale are effective ways to promote the technical revolution movement and achieve triple harvests in production, teaching, and research. Our factory has successively established close technical cooperation relationships with seven universities and eight scientific research institutions, especially the "white-headed" agreement with our neighbor, the Harbin Institute of Technology. In recent years, the vast majority of cutting-edge technology and automation work has been achieved through the joint efforts of these units. This year, more than 100 teachers, students, and researchers from various units have come to our factory to participate in more than 30 research projects and assist us in designing major automation projects. They have treated the factory as their home and have integrated with our factory's workers and technicians. The workers said: "Only in the era of Mao Zedong can there be such good college students." Through production practice, teachers, students, and researchers have further enriched their theories and have also made great improvements in their ideology.

    Realize "Four Modernizations, Three Remotes, and Eight-Pronged Advance" to Push the Technical Revolution Movement to a New Stage

    According to the development of the innovation movement in the city, the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee recently put forward a new mobilization slogan to the city's employees, namely "Four Modernizations, Three Remotes, and Eight-Pronged Advance." "Four Modernizations" refers to mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; "Three Remotes" refers to "remote control, remote measurement, and remote communication"; "Eight-Pronged Advance" refers to "Four Modernizations," "Three Remotes," chipless processing, cutting tool reform, comprehensive utilization, design reform, process reform, and management tool reform.

    Our factory resolutely responded to this call of the Municipal Party Committee and pushed the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new stage. At present, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the factory's employees are working hard, determined to increase the three indicators of output, output value, and labor productivity by 50% compared with 1959, save 1,000 laborers throughout the year, save 2,000 tons of steel, realize three automated workshops, 125 automatic production lines, 1,000 single-machine automation units, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the factory reaches 90%, the degree of forging mechanization reaches 95%, and the degree of automation and semi-automation of the factory reaches 70%. In terms of new varieties, 250 to 300 types must be successfully trial-produced, all cutting-edge products must be mastered within one or two years, mass production must be carried out, various cutting-edge technologies must be vigorously tested, and advancement must be made towards full automation and remote control. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we will surely be able to realize our great ambitions.

    Finally, I wish the conference a successful conclusion and all committee members good health.

专栏：

    大搞技术革新和技术革命群众运动
    李保森委员谈哈尔滨轴承厂开展技术革命运动情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，和陈叔通副主席“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我就哈尔滨轴承厂大搞技术革命运动的情况，和我个人肤浅的体会，向大会作一简要汇报，不当之处请委员们批评指正。
    技术革命运动热潮有如万马奔腾，声势浩大，捷报频传
    哈尔滨轴承厂在总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东思想的指导下，在各级党委和部局的正确领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，广泛深入地开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。在省委佳木斯现场会议后，特别是市委在哈尔滨量具刃具厂召开生产自动线会议和一机部召开了黑龙江现场会议后，我厂职工热烈地响应了党的号召，以“生产运动会”的形式掀起了机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化的技术革命运动热潮，犹如万马奔腾，声势浩大，全厂职工从车间到科室，从工人到干部，都以大炼钢铁的干劲，投入这一轰轰烈烈全民性的技术革命运动，捷报频传，人心振奋。在最近不到五六个月的时间内，全厂职工共提出了技术革新项目数万件，平均每人实现三件，全厂已实现自动生产线三十二条，单机自动化三百六十一台，半自动化三百九十六台，手工操作机械化一百五十九项，尖端技术二十五项，尖端产品十二项。
    实现的自动生产线有长有短，有土有洋，大部分都是在工厂原有设备的基础上，采用了先进工艺加以改装而形成的，具有结构简单，操作方便，花钱少，效率高的特点。如204型套圈车工自动线，是用老式车床和压力机改装而成的，工序由六道减少为四道，产量提高了30％，劳动生产率提高了三倍，工作地面积节省了32％。
    单机自动化、半自动化，正在由点到面地发展着。多少年来一直是用手工操作的，如套圈抛光，保持架冲压及打毛刺，表面质量检查，尺寸选别、打字、涂油、包装等工序，都已试验成功了自动化、半自动化，改善了劳动条件。现在工人只要按按电钮，在一定时间内作些抽查、调整工作就行了。一个人可以操纵几台机床，轻松愉快。以前终日紧张操作，累得满头大汗的日子一去不复返了。各种机床正在进行自动化，为进一步形成自动生产线创造条件。
    目前，在我厂辅助车间中的锉、钳、刮、研、锯、去毛刺等操作，广泛地采用了风动工具，已基本作到钳工机械化。厂内运输已由抬筐和手推车改为电瓶车。铁路和汽车装卸已开始采用各种土的和洋的起重装置，全厂在“七一”前可以基本消灭手工操作。
    在尖端技术方面，我厂已初步试验成功了几种无切屑加工工艺，正在集中力量进一步发展，向取消或部分取消毛胚车加工的方向努力前进。遥控这一先进技术已进一步应用到生产车间的机床和机群，配合了电视技术，正向全工部，全车间，以至全工厂全盘自动化大步前进。
    技术革命运动，大大提高了生产力的发展，有力地保证1959年全厂提前两个月完成国家计划和1960年提前十天完成第一季度国家计划。在增产不增人的情况下，为1960年全面超额完成任务持续跃进创造了有利条件。
    开展技术革命运动是发展生产的一条多快好省的途径
    事实说明，大搞机械化、半机械化，自动化和半自动化是一条多快好省地发展生产的有效途径，从我厂的情况来看：
    第一、进一步提高了产量，提高了质量，缩短了生产周期，提高了劳动生产率。如钢球采用热轧工艺，效率提高八倍，劳动生产率提高六倍，相对的材料利用率提高10％左右。
    第二、大量地节省人员、设备和工作地，充分发挥了工厂生产潜力。如轴承套圈抛光机全厂现有四十台，共需一百二十名工人，在4月份实现全面自动化后，有二十台抛光机和三十名工人就够了。今年在讨论国家计划时，各车间原需增加劳动力一千名，技术革新技术革命运动发展起来后，不仅不要增人，还可抽出二百名劳动力补充新建车间。
    第三、改善了劳动条件，保证了安全生产。如轴承套圈抛光工序，老办法工人站着操作，半哈着腰，手脚齐动，八小时内要做二万多次动作；车沟车床工人八小时要作三万余次动作，劳动强度很高；冲压保持架手工操作，容易造成压手事故；钢球及滚子表面质量用肉眼观察，工龄长了，易得近视眼。自动化后彻底解决了这些问题。
    第四、推动了企业管理工作的不断改革。随着技术革新技术革命的发展，迫切要求进行生产组织，制度和管理方法的不断大改大革，否则就会影响群众的积极性，束缚生产力的发展。我厂在巩固发展“两参一改三结合”的基础上，又实现了“一化、二龙、三结合”的企业管理大改革。一化是跃进式工作方法制度化，共四十条，代替了老的企业管理规章制度；二龙是生产组织采用封闭式车间和封闭式生产线的一条龙，和业务管理从科室到车间、工段、小组，各专业自上到下自成完整体系的一条龙；同时还贯彻了集中领导与分级民主管理相结合，一主二从三结合，厂内外三结合的原则。推行以来，更加强了党对生产基层的领导和调动了群众的积极性。
    第五、推动了文化革命运动。为了适应技术革命的要求，全厂职工迫切要求提高理论水平和文化技术水平。在全厂已掀起一个学习毛泽东思想和学习文化的新高潮，入学率和出席率达到90％以上，全厂除了大办政治大学、业余中学、业余大学外，还成立了一个轴承工学院，设有轴承设计，轴承工艺等专业，第一期学生已经入学，从而建立了一个完整的，从低级到高级的职工教育体系。
    第六、加速了人民公社的发展和有力地支援农业的技术改造。我厂是香坊人民公社骨干工厂之一，在公社党委统一领导下，将通过大搞技术革命替换下来的一部分工艺装备，支援了社办工业和农业的技术改造。如社办卫星轴承厂，原系一个草绳厂，几十名工人，经我厂支援后，已发展成拥有六百多工人和六十多台机床的工厂，1960年计划生产一百万套，成为一支不可忽视的力量。我厂还组织了工程技术人员利用业余时间，分片包干，帮助社办工厂，搞机械化、半机械化，自动化和半自动化，同时还充分利用工厂的旧料和废料支持社办工业，作到了原材料综合利用，从而使技术革命运动花朵，开遍了人民公社。
  技术革新和技术革命运动是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物
    以机械化、半机械化，自动化和半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，实现大跃进和发展人民公社的必然产物。作为一个工程技术人员，在这伟大的全民性运动中，受到极其深刻的教育，下面谈一谈个人几点体会：
    （一）党的绝对领导是一切胜利的根本保证。技术工作和其他工作一样，必须坚决依靠党的领导和贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，才能取得巨大成绩，才能符合社会主义建设的要求。党的路线、方针、政策都是从广大人民的利益出发，根据客观发展规律，并考虑了调动一切积极因素的可能制订的，因此最全面，最正确，最能符合广大人民的愿望。工程技术人员要政治挂帅首先就要绝对听党的话，做党的驯服工具，党指向那里，就打向那里，这样才能在社会主义建设中，更好地贡献出自己的力量。
    （二）切实贯彻党的一整套两条腿走路的指导方针，方能使技术革新技术革命运动成为全民性的群众运动，取得高速度跃进。哈尔滨轴承厂在党委的领导下坚决贯彻了土洋并举，先土后洋；远近结合，以近为主的大中小革新相结合；自力更生为主与力争外援相结合，敢想敢干与科学分析相结合；学习与独创相结合等一整套两条腿走路的方针，所以能在短短的时间内，广泛地调动了全厂广大职工的积极性和创造性，使技术革新技术革命运动以排山倒海，一日千里之势，席卷全厂，人人动手，争先立功，围绕着生产关键和薄弱环节，从现有基础出发，由低级到高级，由土到洋，由一般改革到猛攻尖端，不断革命，使运动不断的向前发展。例如钢球热处理自动线五天就完成了两条；204型套圈车工自动线从设计到改装成功不到二十天，就胜利完成，这些都是贯彻执行党的一整套两条腿走路指导方针的结果。
    （三）积极参加技术革命运动，同
  工人群众密切结合，是改造思想的重要途径。在技术革命的进程中，始终贯串着先进思想和保守思想的斗争，贯串着多快好省与少慢差费两条道路的斗争，这也就是两种世界观的斗争。工程技术人员在加强学习毛泽东思想
  的同时，积极地参加到技术革命这一伟大群众运动中，就能不断通过实践，破除迷信，解放思想，打破“条件论”，“神秘论”等各种右倾保守思想，就能够依靠党的领导和工人密切结合，逐渐做到政治挂帅、不断地改造思想，
  提高政治觉悟，从而更好地贡献出自己的力量。
  如我厂技术科的部分同志，在技术革命运动开始时，思想问题没有解决，工作和运动不能很好配合，和群众结合不够密切，经过党委进行了细致的思想教育，思想作风立刻大有转变，仅在一周内就实现了十三项重大技术革命项
  目。通过这些事实，使我深刻地体会到：只有思想红，技术革命才能红。所以技术革命运动也是加速工程技术人员自我改造的运动。
    （四）技术革命必须根据本厂特点，摸索发展规律，进行全面规划。各企业的生产特点不同，我厂生产特点，一是产品精度高，结构简单，几何形状相似，因此有可能按照尺寸精度类型分成若干典型实现系列化，便于组织自动化和连续化的生产。二是产品品种多，批量大，根据统计分析，80％的产量集中在20％的品种上，改变生产组织，大批量和多品种分别对待，便于决定不同工艺装备发展方向。三是材料利用率低，如捧料毛胚利用率仅达26％至32％，锻件毛胚利用率仅达40％至45％，目前我厂采用锻件毛胚的轴承的重量约占产品总重量的75％，有必要改进捧料毛胚工艺，以及大力推行精密锻造等无切屑加工工艺。四是钢球，磙子，保持架等配件可以单独进行生产，易于发展成为自动车间。五是机床种类多，新老并存，必须按照其特点，分别改造利用，使之各得其所。六是手工操作多，如抛光、检查、选别、装配等工序，需要设计制造自动化装置，一步登天，有预见地和将来自动线密切结合。七是可以大量发展和应用尖端技术，不断巩固提高。综观以上特点，我们必须作出全面规划，从现有基础出发，远近结合，土洋并举，长计划短安排，统一领导，上下结合，层层负责，进行不断革命，既能保证实现规划，又能密切结合生产。
    （五）“一主、二从、三结合”，大搞共产主义协作，是促进技术革命运动和使生产、教学、研究三丰收的有效途径。我厂先后和七所大学和八个科学研究机构建立了密切的技术协作关系，尤其是和近邻哈尔滨工业大学订立了“白首偕老”的协定，几年来绝大部分的尖端技术和自动化工作都是和这些单位通力合作所取得的成果。今年各单位派来我厂的师生和研究人员就达一百人以上，参加三十余项研究课题，并协助我们设计重大的自动化项目。他们作到了以厂为家，和我厂工人、技术人员打成一片。工人们说：“只有毛泽东时代，才能有这样好的大学生”。通过生产实践，教师、同学和科研人员也进一步丰富了理论，在思想上也取得了很大的提高。
    实现“四化，三遥，八路进军”，把技术革命运动推向新的阶段
    中共哈尔滨市委，根据全市革新运动发展情况，最近向全市职工提出一个新的动员口号，即“四化，三遥，八路进军”。“四化”是机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化；“三遥”是“遥控，遥测，遥讯”；“八路”是“四化”，“三遥”，无屑加工，刃具改革，综合利用，设计改革，工艺改革，管理工具的改革。
    我厂坚决响应市委这一号召，把全厂的技术革新技术革命运动推向新的阶段。目前全厂广大职工在党委领导下，干劲冲天，决心要把1960年产量，产值，劳动生产率三项指标比1959年提高50％，全年节约一千名劳动力，节约二千吨钢材，实现三个自动化车间，一百二十五条自动生产线，一千台单机自动化，全厂机械化半机械化程度达到90％，锻造机械化程度达到95％，全厂自动化、半自动化程度达到70％。在新品种方面要试制成功二百五十至三百种，要在一二年内掌握全部尖端产品，进行成批生产，大力试验各种尖端技术，向全盘自动化，遥远控制化迈进。我们相信在党的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想旗帜，在大搞技术革新技术革命运动中，一定能够实现我们的雄心壮志。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。
