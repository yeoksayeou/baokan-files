This newspaper reports from Hangzhou on April 29th: Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province has launched a mass movement to build small coal mines using indigenous methods, enabling the region to exceed its state-assigned raw coal production target for the first quarter by 19%.

In order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production, especially the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry, Jinhua Prefecture adhered to the principle of launching projects using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign techniques. The masses were mobilized at all levels to formulate plans and build small coal mines through self-reliance. Currently, a number of small coal mines have been completed and put into production, and a large number of small coal mines are under construction, creating a surge of enthusiasm for counties and communes to establish small coal mines.

In the mass construction of small coal mines, many people's communes adopted the method of simultaneous infrastructure construction and mining, greatly accelerating the speed of well construction. Many people's communes have built two to three pairs of small coal mines in a short period of time.

In the process of building small coal mines, various localities have made do with whatever was available, overcoming difficulties such as shortages of materials, equipment, and technical expertise. For example, in the absence of underground ventilation equipment, they used natural ventilation; without steel drills and picks, they brought their own tools; and without explosives, they made their own. Lacking mining technology, various localities used methods such as master-apprentice relationships and on-site demonstrations to train a large number of coal miners and tunneling workers in a short period of time, enabling the newly built small coal mines to quickly and normally put into production.

Extensive collaboration and mutual support are also important reasons for the rapid development of small coal mines in this region. When some communes were building new small coal mines and lacked tools and equipment, other factories and mining units immediately provided support upon hearing the news. Mechanical plants and other units sent steel hammers and steel drills to the small coal mines. Bamboo ware factories rushed to weave coal baskets to supply the small coal mines for mining and transporting earth.

### 金华专区土法上马大办小煤窑

    金华专区土法上马大办小煤窑
    本报杭州29日电　浙江省金华专区土法上马大办小煤窑，使全区第一季度原煤产量超额19％完成了国家计划。
    为了适应工农业生产，特别是钢铁工业高速度发展的需要，金华专区坚持土法上马、土洋并举的方针，层层发动群众，制订规划，自力更生大办小煤窑。目前，已有一批小煤窑建成投入生产，大批的小煤窑正在兴建。形成了一个县县社社办小煤窑的热潮。
    在大办小煤窑中，不少人民公社采取边基建边开采的方法，大大加速了建井的速度，许多人民公社在短期内都建起了二至三对小煤窑。
    各地在建设小煤窑的过程中，因陋就简，克服了物资、设备和技术力量不足等困难。比如，缺乏井下通风设备，他们就利用自然通风；没有钢钎、洋镐就自带工具；没有炸药就自己动手制造。工人缺乏开采技术，各地用以师带徒、现场表演等方法，在短期内培训了大批挖煤工、掘进工，使新建小煤窑能迅速正常投入生产。
    大搞协作，互相支援，也是这个地区的小煤窑高速发展的重要原因之一。有的公社在新建小煤窑时，工具、设备不够，其他厂矿单位闻讯后，立即给予支援。机械厂等单位给小煤窑送去钢锤、钢钎；竹器厂突击编织煤筐，供给小煤窑挖煤运土用。
