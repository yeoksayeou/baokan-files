Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: Jiangxi Province has transferred more than 30,000 cadres this year to participate in labor training. More than 90% of them have been sent to poor and backward teams in people's communes throughout the province, as well as remote areas with weak work foundations and difficult conditions, to participate in labor production while helping the poor and backward teams catch up with the advanced.

Among these cadres sent downward, there are leading cadres at all levels, as well as young intellectual cadres who have not been working for long. According to statistics from six special districts and cities, including Jiujiang and Shangrao, there are more than 500 leading cadres at the county level and above who have been sent downward. Before being sent downward, they all formulated labor training plans, determined to strive to be "five-good" commune members or outstanding workers, live, eat, and work with the workers and peasants, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, and train themselves to become both red and expert cadres; at the same time, they actively propagate the Party's policies and help the backward catch up with the advanced.

At the same time, various localities have also sent some cadres to the local red banner communes, participating in labor while holding substantive positions in the communes, helping to summarize advanced experiences, establish banners, and promote overall leaps forward. In addition, in order to promote the current development of pig raising, a number of cadres have also been sent to pig farms in people's communes throughout the region to work as feeders. Tan Chunhua, the female deputy county chief of Yugan County, was sent to a pig farm in a commune to work as a feeder. Not only was she careful in feeding, but she also personally led the pigs to breed. Under her leadership, the work of leading pigs to breed in the county has been completely taken over by women, freeing up a large number of male laborers to strengthen the preparation for spring plowing production.

Jiangxi Province also plans to send all of the province's more than 200,000 on-the-job cadres, with the exception of a small number of elderly and weak people who cannot participate in physical labor, to participate in physical labor training in basic-level units in batches for more than one month.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: In the first three months of this year, Fujian Province has already sent about 20,000 cadres from county-level and above organs to factories and rural areas to participate in labor training for one month to one year. Among them, more than 4,700 cadres have been sent to rural people's communes and factories and mines to participate in labor for one year.

Most of these cadres who have been sent to the grassroots level to participate in labor for one month to one year have gone to poor and backward teams in remote people's communes to serve as commune members, feeders, or cooks. In participating in labor training, they further promote the catching up of poor teams with rich teams, and the consolidation and development of the pig industry and public canteens. In the first batch of 52 cadres sent to various communes and brigade livestock farms in Luoyuan County this year to work as feeders, they actively worked with the cadres and commune members of the livestock farms to use old materials to build 162 pigsties, reclaim wasteland and plant more than 360 mu of feed, and vigorously carry out the reform of pig-raising tools, thereby prompting the various livestock farms to rapidly increase the number of pigs raised by 1.5 times without increasing manpower; 19 cadres were rated as "five-good" cadres by the commune members because of their good labor, good contact with the masses, good work, good unity, and good study.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: Anhui Province has sent nearly 8,000 cadres to rural areas or areas with weak work foundations this year, participating in physical labor while helping with basic-level work. The number of cadres sent downward has increased by more than 40% compared with last year.

This year, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee emphasized in organizing cadres to participate in labor training that after the cadres go to the grassroots level, they should participate in physical labor while helping basic-level units to do a good job in publicity and education, and help basic-level cadres improve their theoretical and cultural level. It is also stipulated that the leading cadres sent to the countryside should concurrently serve as deputy secretaries of the Party branches of production teams, deputy production team leaders, etc., to strengthen the Party's leadership on the agricultural front, and at the same time enable the combination of leadership work and basic-level work, the combination of labor and work, the combination of leaders and the masses, and the combination of theory and practice.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th: Gansu Province has sent more than 6,000 cadres to the grassroots units of rural people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises this year to participate in labor training for about one year.

The vast majority of these more than 6,000 cadres are young intellectuals who have not experienced revolutionary struggle and labor training, and some are even students who have just left school. After they arrive at the grassroots units of people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises, they mainly improve their communist awareness and conduct comprehensive training and transformation through participation in production labor, learning industrial and agricultural production knowledge, and further improve their communist consciousness in actual struggles. At the same time, they will also spend part of their time helping basic-level units work, to strengthen the strength of the front line of drought resistance production and ensure the high-speed development of agriculture in the province.

    江西福建安徽甘肃下放大批干部
    一面劳动锻炼一面推动工作
    据新华社南昌16日电　江西省今年抽调了三万多名干部下放劳动锻炼。其中90％以上是下放到全省各人民公社中的穷队、后进队和工作基础比较薄弱、条件比较艰苦的偏僻地区，一面参加劳动生产，一面帮助穷队和后进队赶上先进。
    在这批下放干部中，有各级领导干部，也有刚参加工作不久的青年知识分子干部。据九江、上饶等六个专区和市的统计，下放的县级以上领导干部有五百多人。他们在下放前都制订了劳动锻炼规划，决心争取做一个“五好”社员或优秀工人，和工农群众同吃同住同劳动，虚心向工人农民学习，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的干部；同时积极向群众宣传党的方针政策，帮助后进赶上先进。
    与此同时，各地还把一部分干部下放到各地的红旗公社，一面参加劳动，一面担任公社实职，帮助总结先进经验，树立旗帜，带动全面跃进。此外，为了推动当前养猪事业的发展，还下放了一批干部到各地人民公社的养猪场当饲养员。余干县女副县长谭春花，下放到一个公社的养猪场当饲养员，不但喂养细心，还亲自牵猪配种。在她的带动下，全县牵猪配种的工作已全部改由妇女担任，腾出大批男劳力加强了春耕生产的准备工作。
    江西省今年还准备将全省二十多万在职干部，除少数年老体弱不能参加体力劳动的人以外，都分期分批下放到基层单位参加一个月以上的体力劳动锻炼。
    据新华社福州16日电　福建省县以上机关今年的头三个月已经下放了两万名左右的干部，到工厂和农村参加一个月到一年的劳动锻炼。其中下放到农村人民公社和工厂、矿山参加一年劳动的干部有四千七百多名。
    这批下放到基层参加一个月到一年劳动的干部，大部分都到边远地区人民公社的穷队和后进队担任社员、饲养员或炊事员，在参加劳动锻炼中进一步促进穷队赶富队和养猪业、公共食堂的巩固和发展。罗源县今年第一批下放到各公社和大队畜牧场当饲养员的五十二名干部，在参加一个月的劳动中，积极和畜牧场的干部、社员利用旧料修建了一百六十二间猪舍，开荒和种植饲料三百六十多亩，并大搞养猪工具改革，从而促使各个畜牧场在不增加人力条件下，养猪头数迅速增加了一点五倍；有十九个干部由于劳动好、联系群众好、工作好、团结好、学习好而被社员们评为“五好”干部。
    据新华社合肥16日电　安徽省今年下放了近八千名干部到农村或工作基础薄弱的地区，一面参加体力劳动，一面帮助基层工作。下放干部的人数比去年增加了40％以上。
    中共安徽省委今年在组织干部下放劳动锻炼的工作中，特别强调干部到基层后，要一面参加体力劳动，一面帮助基层单位做好宣传教育工作，帮助基层干部提高理论文化水平。并规定下放到农村的领导干部，要兼任生产队的党支部副书记、副生产队长等职务，以加强党对农业战线的领导，同时又可以使领导工作和基层工作相结合，劳动和工作相结合，领导和群众相结合，理论与实际相结合。
    据新华社兰州16日电　甘肃省今年下放了六千多名干部到农村人民公社和工矿企业的基层单位，参加为期一年左右的劳动锻炼。
    这六千多名干部，绝大部分都是没有经过革命斗争和劳动锻炼的青年知识分子，有的还是刚出校门的学生。他们到人民公社和工矿企业的基层单位后，主要是通过参加生产劳动，学习工农业生产知识，在实际斗争中进一步提高共产主义觉悟，进行全面的锻炼和改造。同时，也将以一部分时间帮助基层单位工作，以加强抗旱生产第一线的力量，保证全省农业的高速度发展。
