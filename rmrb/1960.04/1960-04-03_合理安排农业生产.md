Rationally Arrange Agricultural Production

The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress is heatedly discussing the 1960 national economic plan. In the report delivered to the Congress on behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that the arrangement of the 1960 national economic plan should further establish the foundation as agriculture and the leading role as industry, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. The 1960 agricultural production should continue to take grain as the key link, and under the premise of ensuring increased grain production, comprehensively arrange the production of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, and simultaneously implement agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, striving for the overall and great development of agriculture. The people's communes in rural areas across the country are all comprehensively planning the year's production and arranging crop planting according to this basic policy, striving for a comprehensive and better leap forward.

Rationally arranging various productions within agriculture, and achieving comprehensive development of diversified operations with grain as the key link, is an important symbol of the new stage of agricultural development in our country and a characteristic of agricultural production in the era of people's communes. Only the "large in scale and collective in nature" people's communes can most rationally allocate manpower, materials, and land resources, greatly expand the scope of operations, and achieve a high degree of comprehensive management. In 1959, the first year after the realization of people's communes, our agriculture took grain as the key link and comprehensively developed diversified operations, achieving great success. In this year, with the continued leap forward in the output value of agriculture (planting industry), the proportion of the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in the total agricultural output value has risen to 23%. This year, it is required to ensure a relatively large increase in grain production, and at the same time, increase the production of cotton, hemp, oilseeds, sugar crops, vegetables, etc.; vigorously develop animal husbandry with pig raising as the head, and equal emphasis on pigs and large livestock; forestry, sideline occupations, and fishery should also have corresponding development. To this end, it is necessary to make unified and rational arrangements for both broad agriculture and narrow agriculture to ensure the realization of a comprehensive leap forward. Broad agriculture includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery; narrow agriculture also includes grain production, industrial raw material production, and non-staple food production. Each of these departments and projects is closely related to the production and construction of the entire society and the people's livelihood. Comprehensively and rationally arranging the various departments and projects included in broad agriculture and narrow agriculture is an extremely important strategic deployment in socialist construction.

In the ten years since the liberation of our country, grain production has increased by one and a half times; with the continuous increase in population, it has also increased by more than one time per capita in ten years. Why is it still necessary to put grain production in the first place? This is primarily because grain occupies a particularly important position in the entire national economy and even in the entire agricultural production. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and grain is the foundation of this foundation. Without the continuous leap forward in grain production, there can be no continued leap forward in other departments within agricultural production, nor can there be a high speed of industrial production. Although the total grain output has increased by one and a half times in ten years, because the original base was too low, even after increasing by so much, it is still not enough to meet the needs. The improvement of people's lives, the natural increase in population, and the development of animal husbandry all require more grain; the industrial use of grain and reserve grain also need to be increased. It must also be understood that grain production is not like industrial production, where the production of the previous year is the basis for the production of the next year, but must be started from sowing every year. Moreover, it is not like the production of steel and machinery, where the products can be used for a relatively long period of time after they come out, nor is it like cotton textiles that can be worn for many years, but are consumed once they are eaten or used. Therefore, grain production must be grasped tightly every year and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

Taking grain as the key link does not mean grasping grain in isolation. Where there is a "key link," there are also "items." Since it is a "key link," it means that while grasping it, the entire "net" of agriculture is lifted up. If it is separated from the other parts of the entire agriculture, it will not be a "key link." Other items besides grain production, such as the production of industrial raw material crops, animal husbandry production, forestry production, etc., must also meet the needs of the entire socialist construction. The production of these projects has also increased significantly in the past ten years; however, even with the largest increase in cotton, it was more than four times higher in 1959 than in 1949, but it still averaged less than ten catties per person, and still cannot meet the needs of national economic development. Industrial raw material crops such as oilseeds, hemp, and sugar crops, as well as some other items, are still relatively slow-growing and weak links, and it is even more necessary to speed up the pace and catch up with the growth rate of grain and cotton. It must also be seen that with the continuous leap forward in industrial production and grain production, the needs of urban and rural people for various daily necessities and non-staple foods are also constantly increasing; only by further developing diversified operations can we adapt to this new situation. Taking the needs of agricultural production itself, or the further development of grain production, it cannot be separated from the comprehensive development of diversified operations. The development of forestry is conducive to maintaining water and soil, transforming the climate, and reducing the threat of natural disasters to crops; accelerating the development of animal husbandry can provide more power and fertilizer for agriculture; developing cash crops can provide more funds for grain production, and directly or indirectly provide a lot of means of production for grain production.

It is necessary to increase grain production relatively greatly, and also to plant more cash crops, and at the same time to develop animal husbandry and forestry. The area of cultivated land is limited, so what should be done? The way out is to greatly improve the utilization rate of land. To this end, it is necessary to expand the area of cultivated land, increase the area of multiple cropping, and increase the unit yield simultaneously. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total output of grain and the total output of cash crops both increased year by year. This was mainly due to the increase in the yield per unit area and the expansion of the sown area. During this period, although the sown area of grain increased, the proportion it occupied in the sown area decreased year by year. This was due to the increase in the planting of cash crops. This situation is reasonable. Now, in order to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, we must, under the condition of increasing the total sown area, on the one hand, appropriately expand the sown area of grain crops and try our best to increase the unit yield, and on the other hand, plan and proportionally appropriately increase the proportion of cash crops sown area in the total sown area. Since it was possible to do this during the First Five-Year Plan period, it is even more possible to do so now that the unit yield has been further increased. The provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have reclaimed a large amount of wasteland last winter and this spring, and have tried every means to increase the multiple cropping index and utilize fragmented land. This year's total sown area will increase a lot compared with last year. This provides favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of grain and cash crops. Under such circumstances, all people's communes and relevant departments must do a good job in land use planning, under the principle of obeying the state plan, adapt to local conditions, make rational arrangements, pay high attention to saving land, and further improve the land utilization rate.

It is necessary to increase grain production relatively greatly, and also to comprehensively develop diversified operations. The labor force is limited, so what should be done? The way out is also to make rational arrangements for the labor force, so that the proportion of the labor force occupied by each department and each project is adapted to the overall layout, and the labor productivity is greatly improved. In order to improve labor productivity, the fundamental way is to implement both mechanization and semi-mechanization, and both foreign and local methods. The Party and the government plan to basically realize agricultural mechanization within ten years, but in the recent three years, it is still necessary to focus on improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and to launch a mass technical innovation movement throughout the country. The technical innovation movement should be closely combined with the various increased production measures of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, so that the reform of tools and the creation of machinery are both conducive to saving labor and conducive to intensive cultivation. Rationally deploying and arranging the labor force according to the different growing seasons of various crops can avoid the phenomenon of being busy at times and idle at times. Various specialized teams engaged in diversified operations can, when necessary, organize large-scale collaboration between teams, which is both convenient for improving labor efficiency and convenient for giving full play to labor potential. The correct layout of animal husbandry, such as building pig farms, sheepfolds, and livestock pens on the mountains in bumper harvest areas, can greatly save labor and improve labor productivity. As long as we find ways from many aspects, work hard, manage carefully, and arrange rationally, the problem of labor shortage caused by the comprehensive development of diversified operations can definitely be solved.

Further implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations will bring about a series of new problems in terms of organizational leadership, ideological leadership, business management, and technological transformation. The guiding ideology and working methods must be adapted to this new situation on the agricultural front. The Neijiang Special District of Sichuan adopted a whole set of comprehensive management and comprehensive leap forward leadership methods last year, which achieved very good results. These methods are: leaders divide responsibilities, divide areas and set points; work scheduling, comprehensive arrangements; labor force demarcation (front), division of labor and collaboration; adapt to local conditions, front and back connection; ensure key points (grain), highlight characteristics (cash crops). As a result, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations for the whole year increased by another 32% compared with the great leap forward in 1958. As production management becomes more and more centralized, comprehensive management becomes more and more developed, and the relationship between agriculture and various aspects becomes closer and closer, and the exchanges between one region and another become more and more frequent, the comrades who lead agricultural production in various places must not only pay more comprehensive attention to the various departments and projects of agricultural production, but also pay attention to the entire economic construction and the diverse needs of the people in various parts of the country, and implement communist large-scale collaboration with relevant places and relevant departments. Only in this way can the production and management of this region and this unit develop better and faster in proportion.

At present, it is the season for sowing, mating, and afforestation. Whether the proportion of various departments of agricultural production and the proportion of various crops throughout the year are appropriate and meet the requirements of the state plan depends to a large extent on the rational arrangement of this current season. All localities must implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and correctly allocate the sown area of various crops on the basis of striving to increase the total sown area; at the same time, strive to improve the breeding rate and survival rate of livestock, expand the afforestation area and improve the survival rate of afforestation. If the comprehensive arrangements for spring production are done well and implemented in each production team, the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production throughout the year will have a solid foundation.

    合理安排农业生产
    第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正在热烈地讨论1960年的国民经济计划。李富春副总理代表国务院向大会提出的报告中指出，1960年国民经济计划的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合；1960年的农业生产，应当继续以粮为纲，在保证粮食增产的条件下，全面安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各类农作物的生产，并且实行农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举，争取农业的全面大发展。全国农村人民公社都在根据这个基本方针全面规划全年的生产，安排作物的种植，争取全面的更好的跃进。
    合理安排农业内部的各项生产，作到以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营，是我国农业发展新阶段的重要标志，是人民公社时代农业生产的特色。只有“一大二公”的人民公社，才有可能最合理地支配人力物力地力，大大扩展经营范围，实现高度的综合经营。在1959年，实现人民公社化以后的第一年，我国农业以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营，取得了很大的成就。这一年，在农业（种植业）的产值继续跃进的情况下，林、牧、副、渔的产值在农业总产值中所占的比重，已经上升到23％。今年，要求保证粮食继续有较多的增产，同时更多地增产棉花、麻类、油料、糖料、蔬菜等等；大力发展以养猪为首、猪和大家畜并重的畜牧业；林业、副业、渔业也要有相应的发展。为此，无论是广义的农业，还是狭义的农业都有必要加以统一的合理的安排，保证实现全面的跃进。广义的农业，包括农、林、牧、副、渔各个部门；狭义的农业，也包括粮食生产、工业原料生产和副食品生产各个项目。这些部门，这些项目，每一个都同整个社会上的生产建设和人民生活有密切的关系。把广义的农业和狭义的农业所包括的各个部门、各个项目全面地合理地加以安排，是社会主义建设中的一个极其重要的战略部署。
    我国解放后十年间，粮食产量已经增长了一倍半；在人口不断增加的情况下，按人口平均，十年间也增长了一倍多。为什么仍然要把粮食生产放在第一位呢？这首先是因为，粮食在整个国民经济生活中以至整个农业生产中，都占着特别重要的地位。农业是国民经济发展的基础，粮食则是这个基础的基础。没有粮食生产的持续跃进，就不可能有农业生产内部其它各部门的继续跃进，也不可能有工业生产的高速度。十年间粮食总产量虽然增长了一倍半，但因为原来的基数太低，增加了这样多以后仍然不足以适应需要。人民生活的改善，人口的自然增加，畜牧业的发展，都需要更多的粮食；工业用粮和储备粮也都需要增加。还必须了解，粮食生产既不像工业生产那样，上一年的生产是下一年生产的基础，而是每年都得从播种开始，而且也不像钢铁、机械生产那样，产品出来之后可以比较长时期地使用，也不像棉织品一样可以穿用多年，而是吃一次、用一次就消耗掉了。因此，对粮食生产必须年年都抓得紧紧的，丝毫不可放松。
    以粮为纲，并不是孤立地抓粮食。既有“纲”，也就有“目”。既然是“纲”，也就是说在抓住它的同时把整个农业的“网”都提起来。如果脱离了整个农业的其它部分，它也不成其为“纲”了。粮食生产之外的其它项目，如工业原料作物的生产、牧业生产、林业生产等等，同样必须适应整个社会主义建设的需要。这些项目的生产，十年来也都增加了不少；但是，以增长幅度最大的棉花来说，1959年比1949年提高了四倍多，也还平均不到每人十斤，仍然不能适应国民经济发展的需要。油料、麻类、糖料等工业原料作物，还有别的一些项目，至今仍然是增长速度比较迟缓的薄弱环节，更要加快步伐，赶上粮、棉的增产速度。也必须看到，在工业生产和粮食生产不断跃进的情况下，城乡人民对于各种日用品和副食品的需要也在不断增长；只有进一步发展多种经营，才能适应这新的形势。就以农业生产本身的需要来说，或者以粮食生产的进一步发展来说，也离不开全面发展多种经营。林业的发展，有利于保持水土，改造气候，减少自然灾害对农作物的威胁；加快牧业的发展，可以为农业提供更多的动力和肥料；发展经济作物，可以为粮食生产提供更多资金，并且直接或者间接地为粮食生产提供很多生产资料。
    既要较多地增产粮食，又要多种植经济作物，同时还要发展牧业、林业，耕地面积有限，怎么办？出路在于大大提高土地利用率。为此必须扩大耕地面积、增加复种面积、提高单位产量同时并举。在第一个五年计划期间，粮食的总产量和经济作物的总产量都是逐年增长的。这主要是由于提高单位面积产量和扩大播种面积。在这个期间内，粮食的播种面积虽然是增加了，但在播种面积中所占的比例却逐年降低，这是由于经济作物的种植增加了。这种情况是合理的。现在，为了贯彻执行以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，我们要在增加总播种面积的条件下，一方面适当扩大粮食作物的播种面积和尽力提高单位产量，另方面有计划按比例地适当增加经济作物播种面积在播种总面积中的比重。既然在第一个五年计划期间可以这样做，现在单位产量已经进一步提高，就更有可能这样做。各省、市、自治区去冬今春开垦了大量的荒地，并且千方百计提高复种指数和利用零星土地，今年的播种总面积将比去年增加很多。这就为粮食和经济作物的全面发展提供了有利条件。在这种情况下，各个人民公社和有关部门必须做好土地利用规划，在服从国家计划的原则下，因地制宜，合理安排，高度注意节约土地，进一步提高土地利用率。
    既要较多地增产粮食，又要全面发展多种经营，劳动力有限，怎么办？出路也在于对劳动力加以合理的安排，要使各个部门、各个项目占用劳动力的比例，同整个的布局相适应，并且要大大提高劳动生产率。为了提高劳动生产率，根本的一条是实行机械化和半机械化同时并举，洋的和土的同时并举。党和政府计划在十年的时间内基本实现农业机械化，但在最近三年内，还要以改良农具和半机械化农具为主，要发动全国农民群众大搞技术革新运动。技术革新运动要和农业“八字宪法”的各项增产措施密切结合，使工具的改革、机械的创制既有利于节约劳力，又有利于精耕细作。各种作物按生长季节的不同合理部署安排劳动力，可以避免时忙时闲的现象。从事多种经营的各种专业队，必要时可以组织各队之间大协作，既便于提高劳动效率，又便于充分发挥劳动潜力。畜牧业的正确布局，如在丰产方里建设猪场、羊圈和畜圈上山等等，都可以大大节约劳动力，提高劳动生产率。只要从多方面想办法，苦心经营，合理安排，因全面发展多种经营而出现的劳动力不足的问题就一定能够解决。
    进一步贯彻执行以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，在组织领导、思想领导、经营管理、技术改造等方面都会发生一连串新的问题。领导思想和工作方法一定要同农业战线上的这种新形势相适应。四川内江专区去年采取一整套综合经营、全面跃进的领导方法，收到了很好的效果。这些方法是：领导分工，划片定点；工作排队，全面安排；劳力划线（战线），分工协作；因地制宜，前后衔接；保证重点（粮食），突出特点（经济作物）。这样做的结果，全年农副业总产值比大跃进的1958年又增加32％。由于生产管理越来越集中，综合经营越来越发展，农业同各方面的关系也越来越密切，一个地区同各个地区的交往也越来越频繁，因此，各地领导农业生产的同志，不仅要更全面地关心到农业生产的各个部门、各个项目，还要关心整个经济建设，关心全国各地人民群众的多种多样的需要，同有关地方、有关部门实行共产主义大协作。也只有这样，才能使本地区、本单位的生产经营更好地按比例高速度地发展。
    目前，正是播种、配种、造林的季节。全年农业生产各部门的比例和各种作物的比例是否适当，是否符合国家计划的要求，在相当大的程度上决定于当前这个季节的合理安排。各地一定要贯彻执行以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，在努力增加播种总面积的基础上正确地分配各种作物的播种面积；同时努力提高牲畜繁殖率和成活率，扩大造林面积和提高造林的成活率。做好了春季生产的全面安排，并且落实到各个生产队，全年农业生产的全面跃进就有了稳固的基础。
