Great Achievements on the Agricultural Production Front of Socialist Countries
Ye Huosheng

The inevitable trend of the socialist camp getting better day by day and the imperialist camp rotting day by day is being proven in every aspect of social life, and the agricultural production front is no exception. The United States, the leader of the capitalist world, saw its net agricultural income decrease by 16% last year compared to the previous year, and according to the unanimous estimates of American economists, this downward trend will continue this year. Conversely, the socialist camp achieved great successes on the agricultural production front last year.

Last year, many socialist countries encountered major natural disasters, which affected agricultural harvests. However, in socialist countries, people did not succumb to natural disasters. Relying on the correct leadership of the Party, the broad masses launched a heroic struggle against natural disasters. Man will conquer nature. Some countries maintained production despite the disaster, while others achieved extraordinary harvests or realized large-scale production increases while vigorously developing agricultural cooperation after overcoming severe natural disasters.

The glorious achievements of our country and the Soviet Union in agricultural production last year are already well known. There is no need to elaborate on China's achievements. Last year was the first year of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan to fully unfold communist construction. Agricultural workers' enthusiasm for production soared, and they widely launched a competition to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule, achieving great success. Despite unfavorable climatic conditions, the Soviet Union's total grain harvest last year exceeded the average harvest of 1954-1958 by 700 million poods, and cotton production reached a record high in Soviet history, reaching 4.7 million tons. In terms of animal husbandry, total milk production has exceeded that of the United States, and the production of animal oil has exceeded that of the United States both in terms of total output and per capita output.

Although the Eastern European socialist countries suffered varying degrees of drought last year, Bulgaria and Romania both achieved bumper harvests. In the ten years from 1948 to 1958, 1951 was Bulgaria's biggest harvest year, yielding 4.82 million tons of grain, but last year, in the drought year, the total grain output was still 50,000 tons more than in the bumper year of 1951. Romania also suffered from drought last year, but total grain output reached more than 11 million tons, an increase of more than 40% over the previous year, giving the country an average of more than 1,200 jin of grain per person.

Some countries, although their production did not increase much or did not increase at all after overcoming natural disasters, still achieved very excellent achievements in some parts and in some aspects. For example, Czechoslovakia did not increase production due to a severe autumn drought, but the summer harvest was very good, with total summer grain production increasing by 14.7%, and the average yield of wheat, the main food crop, increasing by 400 kilograms per hectare. Another example is Hungary, where last year was a year of great development in agricultural cooperation, achieving a double harvest of cooperation and agricultural production increase. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased dramatically by two times in one year. Although the total value of agricultural output increased by only 5.7% over the previous year due to natural disasters, the increase in the summer harvest was very prominent, with the total output of summer grain increasing by 54% and the yield per unit area increasing by 61%. In particular, the cooperatives demonstrated their superiority in increasing production, with new cooperatives being 10% to 15% higher than individual farmers, and old cooperatives being as much as 25% higher than individual farmers.

The socialist countries in Asia also achieved great successes on the agricultural front last year. For example, in Vietnam, last year was also a year of double harvests of agricultural cooperative movement and agricultural production increase. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased eight times compared with the previous year; in terms of production increase, the total value of agricultural output exceeded the target set by the original three-year plan (1958-1960) by 50%, of which the total output of rice reached 400% of the planned target.

In North Korea, in order to meet the needs of industrial development, the area of economic crops was rapidly expanded, increasing by 98% in one year. The area of food crops was thus somewhat restricted, but great achievements were made in increasing the yield per unit area, with the average yield per mu increasing by 17.3%.

In the Mongolian People's Republic, historically significant major achievements were made in agricultural and animal husbandry development last year. Since the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in 1958 passed the decision to basically realize the agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation in three years and the Third Plenary Session of 1959 put forward the policy of giving equal importance to agriculture and animal husbandry, a high tide of developing cooperatives and developing agriculture was formed throughout the country, thus achieving bumper harvests in agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In terms of cooperation, the number of households joining the cooperatives last year reached 99.3% of the total number of households, and the number of livestock joining the cooperatives reached 73.3% of the total number of livestock, basically completing the task of socialist transformation. In terms of agriculture, the cultivated area was expanded to more than 160,000 hectares, an increase of 52%. State-owned farms and agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives over-fulfilled the task of expanding cultivated land, and the achievements of agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives were particularly outstanding, over-fulfilling the task by 388.6%. Total grain output reached 130,000 tons, an increase of 41%. In terms of animal husbandry, 452,000 new livestock were added, an increase of 1.9%.

The above-mentioned major achievements of various countries cannot be regarded as a problem of one country or one year, but are of great significance to the entire socialist camp. First of all, the achievement last year is not only because it appeared in many socialist countries with greater universality; more importantly, this achievement was mostly achieved after overcoming natural disasters; this shows that if the weather is better, it is of course more guaranteed to achieve such an achievement. It proves that high-speed development can also be achieved in agricultural production, and it is entirely possible to accelerate agricultural development to overcome the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development. Secondly, last year's achievements also proved that large-scale and high-speed development in agricultural cooperation not only does not hinder agricultural production increase, but is also an important factor in promoting production increase. The cooperative development of various countries is shown in the following table:

		1952	1953	1954	1955	1956	1957	1958	1959
Albania		Cultivated Land	6.7	3.3	9.6	14.5	30.8	58.1	76.2	83.2
			Households	3.8	5.2	5.7	7.8	——	——	63.2	70.1
Romania		Cultivated Land	2.7	8.2	9.8	11.3	12.4	17.3	34.0	73.0
			Households	2.4	7.9	8.3	9.6	11.5	19.8	41.3	73.5
North Korea	Cultivated Land	——	0.6	30.9	48.6	77.9	93.7	100
			Households	——	1.2	31.8	49.0	80.9	95.6	100
Mongolia		Households	5.0	——	7.5	10.0	20.0	34.8	75.0	99.3
			Livestock	1.2	——	——	8.3	15.9	24.7	35.0	73.3
Bulgaria		Cultivated Land	60.5	61.1	61.3	62.5	77.4	86.5	92.0
German Democratic Republic	Cultivated Land	3.0	12.6	12.8	18.6	23.2	25.2	37.0	45.1
Czechoslovakia	Cultivated Land*	31.9	33.0	28.7	28.9	33.4	61.1	77.0	84.4
Hungary		Cultivated Land*	——	——	——	——	——	27.8	29.5	55.8
Vietnam		Households	——	——	——	——	——	——	5.0	45.4
Poland		Cooperatives	——	——	——	——	——	1,803	1,869	1,962

Note: The numbers for each year are the percentages of cultivated land, peasant households, and livestock to the total, respectively. The number of agricultural cooperatives in Poland is absolute.
*The statistics for cultivated land in Romania in 1959, Czechoslovakia in 1958 and 1957, and Hungary include the state-owned farms, which is the total amount of socialist land.

The table above clearly shows that, regardless of the different starting times and progress speeds of cooperation in various countries, the trend of accelerating the speed of cooperation in the past two years is consistent. It is precisely because of the rapid development in these two years that most countries have basically completed the task of socialist transformation of agriculture, and agricultural production has also achieved decisive achievements in these two years. Looking again from the materials mentioned above, the progress of agricultural production increase is basically consistent with the development of agricultural cooperation. In particular, the fact that the agricultural production increase in Hungary, Vietnam, and Mongolia, where the scale of cooperation was larger and the speed was higher last year, is still very large further proves that the development of cooperation has powerfully promoted the increase in agricultural production.

What are the reasons for the great achievements made by socialist countries on the agricultural production front last year?

Strengthening the leadership of the Party is the root cause of victory. In the past two years, the parties in various countries have paid special attention to the development of agricultural production, especially last year, when they raised the issue of overcoming the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development to an important agenda. In the past two years, the important meetings of the central committees of the parties in various countries have either conducted special discussions on the development of agricultural production or put it forward as one of the important agendas. Even countries such as the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, where the proportion of industry far exceeds that of agriculture, also attach great importance to the development of agriculture, and regard it as an important link that determines the development of the entire national economy. For example, Grotewohl pointed out at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "In the later years of the seven-year plan, the supply and food problems remain the top priority." "From now on, we must pay more and greater attention to agricultural problems than before."

Novotny pointed out at the January Plenary Session of the Czechoslovak Communist Party this year: "Developing agriculture is our top priority in the recent period. Socialist society must stand firmly on two legs, namely on industry and agriculture. We should not think that we are an industrial country, and therefore agricultural production is not very important."

Jędrichowski particularly emphasized the significance of industrial support for agriculture at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, saying: "The solution of our agricultural problems and the improvement of its productivity depend on the technical level and the growth of production of these industrial sectors that serve the needs of agriculture, depend on the speed of solving the technical tasks we face, especially the timely start of production of new products and varieties needed by agriculture, such as new types of tractors and agricultural machinery, drainage and irrigation machinery, transportation tools, new fertilizers, plant protection products, refined feed and compound feed, building materials needed by the countryside, etc. We must remember that it is impossible to build socialism by relying only on the highly developed technology of industry and other sectors of the national economy, while at the same time having backward agriculture and small-scale agriculture. Technological progress in the national economy must lead to the improvement of the level of agriculture and the increase in the degree of socialist transformation of agriculture."

The concern of the central committees of the parties in various countries for agricultural development is also reflected in a series of major measures taken. For example, the combination of mobilizing the masses and the strength of the state to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction, such as water conservancy and power projects, soil improvement projects, etc., has achieved extraordinarily remarkable results. In North Korea, more than 220,000 hectares of irrigated land were expanded in one year last year, increasing the area of paddy fields in the country by nearly one time. In Vietnam, last year, under the guidance of the policy of "mainly run by the people, mainly water storage, and mainly small-scale," twice as much earthwork was completed as in the previous year, expanding the irrigated area in the country to 300% of that in 1958. Not only are the socialist countries in Asia, which mainly grow rice, doing this, but the socialist countries in Eastern Europe, which originally mainly grew dryland crops, are also vigorously building water conservancy projects. For example, in Bulgaria, the total length of newly opened irrigation canals last year was 17,000 kilometers, expanding the irrigated area by 150,000 hectares; and a grand plan was formulated to expand the irrigated area by 2 million hectares in seven years. In Romania, the irrigated area was expanded by 87,000 hectares, over-fulfilling the plan by 8,000 hectares. In Czechoslovakia, where there was originally no habit of using water conservancy in agricultural production, the masses were also mobilized to build water conservancy and carry out soil improvement work last winter and this spring, which has enabled more than 12,000 hectares of dry land and low-lying land to have drainage and irrigation facilities and become fertile fields.

In addition, the parties in various countries, according to the specific conditions of their own countries, seized the central link and drove the work in various aspects. For example, after North Korea put forward the slogan of three modernizations (water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization), the growth of electricity in rural areas last year reached more than 30%, and 88% of the rural areas in the country have realized electrification. This year, the central task of mechanization has been determined, and the guiding principle is to gradually expand from the plains to the mountainous areas, and gradually transition from labor-intensive agricultural work to comprehensive mechanization; to combine large-scale machinery with small and medium-sized machinery, modern machinery with simple machinery, and power machinery with animal power; to realize national mechanization in four to five years or three to four years. In Bulgaria, it was proposed last year that mechanization, water conservancy, increased fertilizer, and improved seeds are "absolutely necessary elements in the struggle to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production," and more attention is paid to the development of animal husbandry in agricultural production increase. In the German Democratic Republic, the focus is on vigorously developing agricultural mechanization to solve the shortage of agricultural labor, and it is stipulated that by the end of the seven-year plan, the degree of mechanization in various agricultural production departments should reach 84% to 100%, respectively. In Poland, technological innovation is the center, and in technological innovation, a large number of agricultural machines are produced, thereby promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture and the improvement of agricultural labor productivity. The situation in other countries is also mostly the same.

Although the achievements made on the agricultural production front last year were very great, it must be recognized that this is only the beginning. On the basis of this achievement, good news has been constantly coming this spring. For example, a new upsurge has appeared in the agricultural cooperation movement in Hungary, and the cultivated area now occupied by agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms accounts for 72% of the country. A high tide of agricultural cooperation has also appeared in the German Democratic Republic, and all fourteen special zones in the country have fully realized cooperation. Along with the excellent situation in the first spring of the 1960s, the socialist camp will surely achieve new, more brilliant, and more magnificent victories on the agricultural production front this year than last year.

    社会主义国家农业生产战线上的巨大成就
    叶蠖生
    社会主义阵营一天天好起来，帝国主义阵营一天天烂下去的必然趋势，每一天都从社会生活各个方面得到证明，在农业生产战线上也不例外。资本主义世界的首领美国，去年农业的纯收入就比上一年减少了16％，而据美国经济学者的一致估计，这种下降的趋势，在今年还要继续下去。反过来看，社会主义阵营去年在农业生产战线上却取得了巨大的成就。
    去年在不少的社会主义国家中曾经遭遇到较大的天灾，影响到农业收成。但是，在社会主义国家中，人们并没有向天灾屈服。依靠着党的正确领导，广大群众向自然界的灾害展开了英勇的斗争，人定胜天，有的国家作到了灾年保产，有的国家则在战胜了严重天灾后仍然获得了特大的丰收，或者是在农业合作化大发展中同时做到了大量增产。
    我国和苏联去年在农业生产中的辉煌成就，早为大家所熟知。我国的成就无须赘述。去年是苏联全面展开共产主义建设的七年计划的第一年。农业劳动者生产热情高涨，广泛展开了提前完成七年计划的竞赛，并取得了巨大成就。尽管气候条件不利，苏联去年的谷物总收获量超过1954—1958年平均收获量七亿普特，棉花的产量是苏联有史以来最多的一年，达四百七十万吨。在畜牧业方面，牛奶总产量已经超过了美国，动物油的产量不但在总产量方面，并且在按人口平均计算的产量方面都超过了美国。
    东欧社会主义各国去年虽然发生了程度不同的旱灾。但是，保加利亚和罗马尼亚仍然都获得了特大丰收。从1948年到1958年的十年中，1951年是保加利亚十年中的特大丰年，收获谷物四百八十二万吨，而去年在大旱年中得到的谷物总产量却比大丰年的1951年还多收了五万吨。罗马尼亚去年也同样受到干旱，但谷物总产量却达到一千一百多万吨，比上一年增产了40％以上，使全国每人平均拥有的粮食合一千二百市斤以上。
    有些国家虽在战胜天灾后增产不多或没有增产，但从某些部分和某些方面来看，还是获得了十分优越的成就。例如捷克斯洛伐克，虽因严重秋旱没有增产，但夏收成绩却很好，夏粮总产量增长14.7％，主要食粮小麦平均每公顷增产四百公斤。又如匈牙利，去年是农业合作化大发展的一年，作到了合作化和农业增产双丰收。入社农户一年中猛增两倍，农业总产值虽因天灾仅比上年增长5.7％，但夏收的增产成绩却十分突出，夏粮总产量增长54％，而单位面积产量则提高61％。特别是合作社在增产中显示了它的优越性，新社比单干户高10％到15％，老社则比单干户高达25％。
    亚洲的各社会主义国家，去年也在农业战线上获得很大的成就。例如在越南，去年也是农业合作化运动和农业增产双丰收年。入社农户比上年增高八倍；增产方面，农业总产值比原三年计划（1958—1960年）规定的指标超过50％，其中稻谷的总产量则达到计划指标的400％。
    在朝鲜，为了适应工业发展的需要，经济作物用地迅速扩大，一年中增加98％，粮食作物用地因而受到了一些限制，但在单位面积产量提高方面，却取得很大成就，平均亩产量增长达17.3％。
    在蒙古人民共和国，去年在农牧业发展上取得了有历史意义的重大成就。自1958年蒙古人民革命党十三次代表大会通过在三年内基本上实现农牧业合作化的决定和1959年三中全会提出农牧业并举的方针后，在全国形成了发展合作社和发展农业的运动高潮，从而获得了在农牧业合作化、农业和牧业三方面的丰收。在合作化方面去年入社户数达总户数的99.3％，入社牲畜头数达总头数73.3％，基本上完成了社会主义改造任务。在农业方面，耕地面积扩大到十六万多公顷，增长52％，国营农场和农牧业合作社都超计划完成了扩大耕地任务，而农牧业合作社的成绩特为优异，超额388.6％完成了任务。谷物总产量达十三万吨，增长41％。在牧业方面，新增殖牲畜四十五万二千头，增长1.9％。
    上述各国的重大成就，决不能看作是一个国家、一个年度的问题，而是对于整个社会主义阵营都具有重大的意义。首先，去年的成就，不仅在于它出现在许多社会主义国家中具有较大的普遍性；更重要的是，这个成就很多是在战胜灾荒后取得的；这说明如果年景较好，取得这样成就当然更有把握。它从而证明了在农业生产中也能有高速度的发展，加快农业发展以克服工农业发展不平衡现象是完全可能的事情。其次，去年的成就，也证明了在农业合作化中大规模地高速度的发展，不仅不会妨碍农业增产，而且还是推动增产的一个重要因素。各国的合作化发展情况如下表：

    ＊罗马尼亚1959年耕地、捷克斯洛伐克1958年和1957年耕地和匈牙利的耕地统计中都包括国营农场部分，为社会主义用地总数。
    上表清楚地显示出，不管各国的合作化开始先后和进展速度各有不同，但在近两年中合作化速度加快的趋势则是一致的。正由于这两年的迅速发展，就使得多数国家在基本上完成了农业社会主义改造任务，农业生产也在这两年中取得了决定性的成就。再从上面讲过的材料来看，农业增产的进度基本上是和农业合作化发展一致的，特别是去年合作化规模较大，速度较高的匈牙利、越南和蒙古三国的农业增产幅度仍然很大这一事实，更证明了合作化的发展有力地推动了农业增产。
    去年社会主义国家在农业生产战线上取得了巨大的成就原因何在？
    加强党的领导是取得胜利的根源。近两年来，各国党对发展农业生产特别重视，尤其是在去年，更把克服工农业发展不平衡问题提到了重要议程上来。两年来各国党中央的各次重要会议上，或是对发展农业生产进行了专门讨论，或是把它作为重要议程之一提出。就是工业比重远超过农业的德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克等国，也同样十分重视农业的发展，把它看作是决定整个国民经济发展的重要环节。例如，格罗提渥在德意志民主共和国统一社会党七中全会上指出：“在七年计划的后几年中，供应和粮食问题仍然是头等重要的问题。”“从现在起，对于农业问题我们必须比以前给予更多更大的重视。”
    诺沃提尼在今年捷共中央一月全会上指出：“发展农业是我们最近时期的首要任务。社会主义社会必须牢实地站在两条腿上，即站在工业和农业上。我们不应该想，我们是工业国家，因而农业生产是不太重要的”。
    英德里霍夫斯基在波兰统一工人党四中全会上特别强调工业支援农业的意义说：“我们农业问题的解决及其生产率的提高，有赖于为农业的需要而服务的这些工业部门的技术水平及其生产数量的增长，有赖于解决我们面临的技术任务的速度，特别是及时开工生产农业所需要的新产品和品种，例如新型的拖拉机和农业机器、排灌机器、运输工具、新的化肥、植物保护用品、精饲料和综合饲料、农村需要的建筑材料等。我们必须记住，仅仅依靠工业和国民经济其他部门的高度发展的技术，与此同时有着落后的农业、细小的农业是不能建设社会主义的。国民经济中的技术进步必须导致农业水平的提高和农业社会主义改造程度的提高。”
    各国党中央对农业发展的关怀，也表现在采取的一系列重大措施方面。例如，用发动群众和国家力量结合的办法来进行农业基本建设，像水利和电力工程，土壤改良工程等等，收到了异常显著的效果。在朝鲜，去年一年中扩大灌溉面积二十二万多公顷，使全国的水田面积增加将近一倍。在越南，去年在以“民办为主、蓄水为主、小型为主”的方针指导下，完成了比上年多两倍的土方工程，使全国灌溉面积扩大为1958年的300％。不仅在亚洲以种植水稻为主的社会主义国家如此，在东欧本来以旱地作物为主的社会主义各国也在大兴水利工程。例如在保加利亚，去年新开的灌溉渠总长度为一万七千公里，扩大灌溉面积十五万公顷；并制定在七年中扩大灌溉面积二百万公顷的宏伟计划。在罗马尼亚，扩大灌溉面积八万七千公顷，超计划多完成了八千公顷。在捷克斯洛伐克，本来在农业生产中没有使用水利的习惯，去冬今春也在发动群众，兴修水利，进行土壤改良工作，已使一万二千多公顷旱地和低洼地有了排灌设施，变成良田。
    此外，各国党根据本国的具体情况，抓住中心环节，带动了各方面工作。例如在朝鲜提出了三化（水利化、电气化和机械化）的口号后，去年在农村中电力增长达30％以上，全国88％的农村已实现了电气化。今年确定以机械化为中心任务，指导方针是从平原逐步扩大到山区，从费力的农活开始逐步过渡到综合机械化；要使大型机械和中小型的相结合，现代化机械和简单的相结合，动力机械和畜力的相结合；在四至五年或三至四年内实现全国机械化。在保加利亚，去年提出以机械化、水利化、增加化肥和改良种子四项工作为“实现农业增产大跃进斗争中绝对必需的要素”的口号，而在农业增产中更多注意畜牧业的发展。在德意志民主共和国，以大力发展农业机械化来解决农业劳动力不足为中心，规定在七年计划终了时，使农业各生产部门的机械化程度，分别达到84％到100％。在波兰，则以技术革新为中心，在技术革新中大量增产农业机器，从而推进农业社会主义改造和农业劳动生产率的提高。其他各国情况也大都如此。
    去年农业生产战线上所取得的成就虽然十分巨大。但必须认识到这还只是事情的开始。在这一成就的基础上，今年春天，好消息就不断传来。例如，匈牙利的农业合作化运动出现了新的高潮，农业合作社和国营农场现在所占的耕地面积已为全国72％。在德意志民主共和国也出现了农业合作化高潮，全国十四个专区已经全部实现合作化了。伴随着六十年代第一个春天的大好形势，今年社会主义阵营在农业生产战线上，一定会取得比去年更辉煌、更壮丽的新的胜利。
