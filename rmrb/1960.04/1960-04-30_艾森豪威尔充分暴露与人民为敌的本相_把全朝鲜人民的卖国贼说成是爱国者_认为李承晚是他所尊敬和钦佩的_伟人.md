Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: U.S. President Eisenhower yesterday praised Syngman Rhee, a long-time lackey and executioner fostered by the United States, at a press conference, while trying his best to portray himself as a "good man" who sympathizes with the South Korean people.

Eisenhower, completely hostile to the Korean people, referred to the traitor Syngman Rhee, who is bitterly hated by the Korean people, as "not only a great man in his country at present and in the past, but also has always been a great patriot. I think he is one of those who deserve the title of 'Father of the Nation'," and as someone he "understands, respects, and admires." He described Syngman Rhee's heinous crimes against the Korean people as merely "making some mistakes here or there" as he "grew older" and "some irregularities in the recent election." He also portrayed Syngman Rhee being overthrown by the people this time as "again showing a statesmanlike attitude."

In the face of the Korean people's anger and world opinion, Eisenhower tried hard to pretend that U.S. imperialism sympathized with the South Korean people, in an attempt to ease the South Korean people's resentment against U.S. imperialism. He vaguely said that he seemed to disagree with some "irregularities" in the South Korean election and "hoped to stop them." Eisenhower also shed crocodile tears, saying that he "very much hates the violence associated with these things." But he admitted that the United States had only told Syngman Rhee that "this situation could lead to trouble," and only as a "friendly gesture."

Eisenhower also indicated that he would not change his planned "visit" to South Korea on June 22.

Eisenhower, when talking about the upcoming East-West summit in Paris at a press conference, said that "there seems to be no possibility of reaching any agreement now that could solve" the West Berlin and German issues "as a whole." He also said that the United States "will not give up" its so-called "legitimate status" in West Berlin.

    艾森豪威尔充分暴露与人民为敌的本相
    把全朝鲜人民的卖国贼说成是爱国者
    认为李承晚是他所尊敬和钦佩的“伟人”
    据新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天在记者招待会上对美国豢养多年的走狗和刽子手李承晚称颂备至，同时竭力把自己装成是同情南朝鲜人民的“大好人”。
    艾森豪威尔和朝鲜人民完全敌对地把朝鲜人民切齿痛恨的卖国贼李承晚说做是“不仅在目前和过去是他的国家里的一个伟人，而且一直是一个伟大的爱国者。我认为，他是当得起‘国父’称号的人之一”，是他所“了解、尊重和钦佩的人物”。他把李承晚对朝鲜人民所犯的滔天罪行说做只是“随着他年纪越来越大”，“在这里或那里犯了一些错误”，“在最近一次选举中有一些违规行为”。他还把李承晚这次被人民赶下台说成是“再次显示了政治家似的态度”。
    在朝鲜人民的愤怒和世界舆论的面前，艾森豪威尔竭力假装美帝国主义是同情南朝鲜人民的，以图缓和南朝鲜人民对美帝国主义的愤恨。他含含糊糊地说他似乎是不同意南朝鲜选举中的一些“违规行为”的，“希望予以停止”。艾森豪威尔还猫哭老鼠地说，他“非常憎恨与这些事有关的暴力行动”。但是他承认，美国只是曾经向李承晚说过“这种情况可能导致麻烦”，而且是作为一种“友好姿态”说的。
    艾森豪威尔还表示他将不改变他预定在6月22日对南朝鲜“访问”的计划。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上谈到即将在巴黎举行的东西方最高级会议时说，“似乎没有什么可能现在就取得能够解决”西柏林和德国问题“整个这个问题的任何协议”。他还说，美国“不会放弃”它在西柏林的所谓“合法地位”。
