    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 22nd: Two hundred and seventy-five overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia aboard the "Fuan" arrived at Zhanjiang Port at 2:00 PM on the 21st. This group of returning overseas Chinese came from areas such as Balikpapan, Tarakan, Muara Badak, and Sembuyung in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. They were warmly welcomed by their relatives from the motherland at the pier.
    Many of these returning overseas Chinese, though they had toiled in Indonesia their whole lives, had extremely simple luggage when they returned to China, some even carrying only a small suitcase. When stepping onto the soil of the motherland, the returning overseas Chinese sincerely appreciated the care and concern the motherland had shown them. Tan Hongbao, an 84-year-old overseas Chinese who had lived in Indonesia for 61 years, stepped ashore alone and said to the welcoming relatives with emotion that it was the greatest happiness of his life that the motherland sent ships to bring them back home. Five seriously ill returnees received careful nursing and care from medical staff as soon as they landed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 21st: Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen today visited displaced overseas Chinese from West Java and impoverished overseas Chinese from Central Java who recently gathered in Jakarta to await their return to China. These overseas Chinese will return to China on the "Russia" ship sent by the Chinese government. Ambassador Huang Zhen was accompanied by Counselor Liu Yufeng, Li Jusheng, and Sima Wensen from the embassy.
    Ambassador Huang Zhen paid special visits to the elderly, weak, and poor overseas Chinese. Ambassador Huang Zhen said to these elderly people, "You have experienced hardships throughout your lives overseas. The motherland welcomes you back, and you will live a happy life in the nursing homes of the motherland." These impoverished overseas Chinese who had lost their livelihoods warmly thanked Ambassador Huang Zhen and the counselors for visiting them and expressed their gratitude to the motherland's government for their care.

    又有二百多侨胞回到祖国
    黄镇大使在雅加达访问另一批即将归国的华侨
    据新华社广州22日电　从印度尼西亚乘“福安”轮归国的二百七十五名侨胞，21日下午二时到达湛江港。这批归侨来自印度尼西亚东加里曼丹的麻里巴板、打拉根、巫劳丹绒、生哇宋布耶等地区。他们在码头上受到了祖国亲人的热烈欢迎。
    这批归侨有很多人虽然在印度尼西亚劳碌一生，回国的时候行李却极为简单，有的甚至只带一个小箱子。归侨们在踏上祖国土地时，都由衷感激祖国对他们的关怀和照顾。在印度尼西亚住了六十一年的八十四岁侨胞谭洪保孑然一身上岸，对着欢迎的亲人，他感动地说，祖国派船接他们回国，这是他们一生中最大的幸福。归侨中五名重病者一上岸就受到医护人员的细心护理和照顾。
    据新华社雅加达21日电　中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇今天访问了最近到雅加达集中等候回国的西爪哇流离失所的华侨和中爪哇的贫苦华侨。这些华侨将乘中国政府派来的“俄罗斯号”轮船回国。陪同黄镇大使去访问的有大使馆参赞柳雨峰、李菊生和司马文森等。
    黄镇大使特别访问了老弱贫苦的侨胞。黄镇大使对这些老年人说，“你们在海外一生历尽艰辛。祖国欢迎你们回去，你们将在祖国的敬老院里过幸福的生活”。这些失去生计的贫苦华侨热忱地感谢黄镇大使和参赞们去看他们，并且对祖国政府对他们的关怀表示感激。
