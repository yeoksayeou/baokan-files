Comrades,

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, those working on language reform are also joining the broad masses in the educational sphere, participating in the "struggle to reform tools and improve operational methods," to ensure that education, science, and culture "better coordinate with and promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production."

In Representative Li Hui's speech, "Phonetic literacy is a powerful weapon for accelerating the intellectualization of workers and peasants," the work experience and tremendous achievements of phonetic literacy in Wanrong County, Shanxi, have been introduced very comprehensively. In Representative Hu Yuzhi's speech, "The Chinese Pinyin Scheme is an effective weapon for cultural revolution," the overview of phonetic literacy and the promotion of Mandarin Chinese seen during the visit to more than a dozen communes and administrative districts in four counties and one city in the Jinan Prefecture of Shanxi Province has also been reported. I will not repeat them, but only summarize a few personal opinions.

The main thing is that the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress passed the Chinese Pinyin Scheme in February 1958. This scheme is a summary of the Chinese people's creation of the Chinese pinyin alphabet over the past sixty years. Many places have used it as a tool to overcome the difficulty of learning Chinese characters for two years. Up to now, its achievements are reflected in: First, "a book shortage in the countryside." In Wanrong County alone, nearly 374,000 copies of phonetic reading materials have been sold in the past four or five months. Every time new books arrive, farmers line up to buy them. This is unprecedented, so visitors excitedly say, "This is truly a scene of eliminating illiteracy." Second, in the lower grades of elementary school, "younger brothers teach older brothers." This is not an isolated phenomenon, because children who learn the pinyin alphabet in the first semester of the first grade can read the language textbook with the pinyin annotations of the new characters in the second semester. Not to mention all the phonetic children's reading materials. The older brothers in the second grade who have not learned the pinyin alphabet are blocked by unfamiliar Chinese characters like "roadblock tigers." Therefore, if the plan is to shorten the six years of elementary school to four years, as far as the language course is concerned, as long as the textbooks are reformed, there is no problem.

The specific work of the cultural revolution, like technological innovation and technological revolution, is for everyone to "participate in the struggle to reform tools and improve operational methods, and combine practical work, hard work, and skillful work." Using the pinyin alphabet to promote a Great Leap Forward in literacy and general education is also a kind of "skillful work." For many years, we have faced the fact that Chinese characters are difficult to learn and have wanted to overcome this difficulty in educational tools and methods. Now, under the correct leadership of the Party, like the technological innovation and technological revolution on all fronts, some amazing achievements have emerged. Let me borrow two slogans from the past in language reform work to make a not-so-mysterious explanation of "skillful work," which is: "Read first, then learn to write," this is regarding reading; and in terms of writing, it is "Forget the character, write its sound."

The so-called "Read first, then learn to write" means first reading the pinyin on the first line of "phonetic reading materials," and then gradually recognizing the Chinese characters on the next line by looking at the pinyin. It is not necessary to wait until two or three thousand new Chinese characters are recognized before reading. It is also not dividing reading and writing into two separate stages of learning. In fact, the Chinese characters in phonetic reading materials are gradually becoming familiar and more familiar as they are encountered, not to mention that the current social environment is full of Chinese characters. The objects of literacy are mostly adults, which is just as Representative Mao Yisheng said in his speech on "Technological Innovation in Spare-time Education," "The general illiterate is not completely culturally illiterate, but only character illiterate." Therefore, as long as there are phonetic reading materials, putting "characters" in the second place, reading according to the sound, and "sound entering the heart and understanding," the working class and the masses, eager to learn, will naturally generate the phenomenon of "farmers lining up to buy and borrow books" in Wanrong. As for elementary school children, according to the experience of Beijing Normal University Experimental Elementary School, phonetic reading materials can be vigorously promoted in the lower grades. Children are very enthusiastic about reading. They have just spent more than a month learning the pinyin alphabet, and their schoolbags are filled with several "phonetic books" in addition to textbooks. They also say, "Mom, take me to buy 'phonetic books.' After picking and choosing, I've already read them all! Teacher! Why don't you publish more 'phonetic books'?" The content of the "phonetic books" that children read is quite extensive, far beyond the scope of textbook knowledge. Scientific common sense and stories of revolutionary struggles not only promote the growth of their knowledge but also enable them to improve their reading ability rapidly, as long as they are not required to recognize Chinese characters. However, reading more "phonetic books" also increases the chances of encountering Chinese characters. The Chinese characters reviewed in class, meeting them multiple times, can be further consolidated, and the understanding of word meanings is expanded and deepened. Some unfamiliar Chinese characters are also recognized with the help of pinyin, and after repeated meetings, they become familiar characters. Therefore, they sing praises: "If you learn pinyin well, Chinese characters rise every day."

If the formal general education system is to be reformed, shortening the term of elementary school, the language course is the focus of curriculum reform. The first volume of the Beijing Elementary School Language Experimental Textbook has only 202 new characters. After reading eight volumes in four years, the children are eleven or twelve years old, and they only recognize about 2,200 new characters, which is still more than 1,000 characters short of the generally used 3,500 characters. If curriculum reform is now carried out, my opinion is: the first volume of the language textbook should only use the 390+ standard Chinese pinyin syllables combined with content as new character teaching, so that children can recognize their entire faces, and then all they see in the first line of the phonetic textbook and phonetic reading material will be familiar friends. This will lay a solid foundation for language learning. The language textbook that prioritizes character recognition can be reformed into a language textbook that develops children's language and enriches children's knowledge, without suppressing them and without falling behind them.

The so-called "Forget the character, write its sound" means that when writing, if you forget a Chinese character that you can't write, replace it with pinyin. Generally speaking, there should be a condition that it must be spelled according to the Beijing pronunciation, and you cannot arbitrarily mix local accents, so that the whole country is consistent, and everyone can understand each other, so as to avoid divergence in the Chinese language; that is to say, promoting Mandarin Chinese and unifying pronunciation are precisely the preconditions for "Forget the character, write its sound." Therefore, like the literacy campaign in Wanrong, reading phonetic reading materials has greatly driven writing. When rural poets and production team leaders pick up a pen, if they encounter a Chinese character that they cannot write, in order not to interrupt their thinking and the expression of their language is not limited by new characters, they simply use letters to spell the sound to replace it first, and then look up the dictionary to add the Chinese characters after writing. As for elementary school children, they can use pinyin to make sentences and write short essays from the first grade; children are also allowed to use pinyin to write longer applications to join the team, which are preliminary writing exercises and cannot be said to be a new pinyin writing system. I don't want to say more about this at this stage.

The Chinese people's work of creating the Chinese pinyin alphabet in the past sixty years was "summarized" in the Chinese Pinyin Scheme that we passed in 1958. The Chinese people's expectation of using the alphabet pinyin to overcome the difficulty of Chinese characters and improve cultural and technical levels over the past sixty years has also been "realized" in today's Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. (This year is the lunar year of "Gengzi." Sixty years ago, in the year of Gengzi, Wang Zhao created a set of "Mandarin Chinese Consonant Alphabet," which was widely promoted at that time. His consciousness was still feudal, but in terms of technology, it was basically consistent with "Read first, then learn to write; Forget the character, write its sound.")

To do this well, language reform workers realize that they must pass the "three barriers" well: The first is the "leadership barrier," which must be politically in command, with local secretaries personally leading, the entire Party starting, the entire people mobilizing, unifying understanding, clarifying the direction, and closely integrating the learning of phonetic literacy with production, that is, production should drive learning, and learning should promote production. In this way, there is no reason for failure. The second is the "teacher barrier." According to the experience of the Dongfanghong Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei Province, a pilot project for phonetic literacy, it was generally believed in the past that teachers for phonetic literacy must have phonetic knowledge and be able to speak Mandarin Chinese correctly and fluently. Facts have proved that this view is divorced from reality. They only had one teacher in the key class who came from a short-term training class, and the rest were factory employees and workers who only learned the pinyin alphabet for three days. They first worked as counselors and soon became the main teachers and taught very well. Now, in provinces such as Fujian, Shandong, and Rong County in Sichuan, training civil teachers is based on the principle of "civilians teaching civilians, and those who are able are teachers," learning the alphabet pinyin as quickly and in as large quantities as possible, while vigorously and gradually improving the quality of teaching, so this second barrier is not difficult to pass. The third is the "phonetic reading material barrier," which is indeed a very urgent issue at present, and we must try every means to find more ways to achieve timely and sufficient supply.

In short, under the correct leadership of the Party, language reform work serves the cultural revolution, technological innovation, and technological revolution, and participates in the struggle to reform tools and improve methods. The goal is to ensure that education, science, and culture better coordinate with and promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

### 拼音字母和文化革命  黎锦熙代表的发言

专栏：

    拼音字母和文化革命
    黎锦熙代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。
    在党的正确领导下，文字改革工作者也正在和广大群众一道，在教育范围内，参加着“改革工具和改进操作方法的斗争”，要保证教育、科学、文化事业“更好地配合和促进工农业生产的大跃进”。
    在李辉代表“注音识字是加速工农知识化的有力武器”的发言中，已把山西万荣县注音识字的工作经验和巨大成就介绍得很全面；在胡愈之代表“汉语拼音方案是文化革命的有效武器”的发言中，也把参观山西省晋南专区四县一市十几个公社和管理区所见的注音扫盲和推广普通话的概况报告了。我都不重复，只就个人意见归纳几点。
    主要是1958年2月第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议通过了汉语拼音方案，这个方案就是六十年来中国人民创造汉语拼音字母的总结；许多地方利用它来作克服汉字难学的困难的工具已历两年。到现在，它的成绩就表现在：一，“农村闹了书荒”，单是万荣一县，近四五个月内，就销售了注音读物三十七万四千册，每次新书一到，农民排队买书，这是史无前例的，所以参观者兴奋地说，“这才真是扫了盲的局面”。二，小学低年级“弟弟教哥哥”，这不是个别的现象，因为一年级第一学期学了拼音字母的儿童，到了第二学期，就能把语文课本按照生字的注音读得下去，全部注音的儿童读物更不消说；而二年级还没有学过拼音字母的哥哥，就被不认得的汉字“拦路虎”似地挡住了。因此，如果计划把小学六年缩短为四年，在语文课方面，只要再把课本革新一下，是没有什么问题的。
    文化革命的具体工作，也跟技术革新和技术革命一样，就在大家都“参加改革工具和改进操作方法的斗争，把实干、苦干和巧干结合起来”。利用拼音字母来促成扫盲和普通教育的大跃进，也正是一种“巧干”。许多年来都面临着汉字难学这个事实，都想在教育工具和方法上克服这种困难，现在在党的正确领导下，也跟各个战线上的技术革新和技术革命一样，当前涌现了若干惊人的成绩，我且借用过去文字改革工作中的两句口号，做个并不奥妙的“巧干”的解释，就是：“先读书，后识字”，这是说阅读方面；而在写作方面，就是“忘其字，写其音”。
    所谓“先读书，后识字”，是指先读“注音读物”头一行的拼音，而后逐渐地对着拼音认识下一行的汉字，不必等到两三千个汉字的生字都认识了才能读书。也并不是把读书和识字分为先后两个阶段来学习，实际上，对于注音读物中的汉字也是渐碰渐熟、越碰越熟的，何况当前社会环境到处都是汉字。扫盲的对象，成人居多，这就正如茅以升代表在“业余教育的技术革新”的发言中所说，“一般文盲并非完全文化盲，而只是字盲”。所以只要有了注音读物，把“字”放在第二位，依音而读，“声入心通”，工农大众，急切求知，自然会发生象万荣“农民排队买书和借书”的现象。至于小学儿童，就北京师范大学实验小学的经验来说，在低年级也可以大力开展注音读物的阅读。孩子们阅读的积极性是很高的，他们刚刚用了一个多月的时间学完拼音字母，书包里除课本外还装着几本“注音书”，还说妈妈带我去买“注音书”，挑来挑去都是看过了的，老师！怎么不多出点“注音书”啊？孩子们读的“注音书”，内容相当广泛，远远超出课本知识的范围，科学常识、革命斗争的故事，不但促进他们知识的成长，也使他们阅读能力迅速提高，只要不要求他们认读汉字。但是，“注音书”读得多，和汉字见面的机会也会多了，课堂上复习过的汉字，多次见面，可以更加巩固，还扩大加深了对词义的理解；不认识的汉字，借助于拼音也认识了一些，再经反复见面就成熟字了。因此他们歌颂说：“拼音学得通，汉字日日升”。
    如果正规的普通教育制度要改革，把小学期限缩短，语文课就是课程改革的重点。北京市初小语文试用课本第一册只有二百零二个生字，四年八册读完，儿童十一二岁了，还只认得二千二百来个生字，对于一般常用的三千五百来个汉字还差一千多；现在如果进行课改，我的意见是：语文课本第一册只要把三百九十几个汉语拼音的标准音节配合内容，当作生字教学，让儿童认熟它们的整个面孔，以后阅读注音课本和注音读物，在头一行中所遇见的都是些熟朋友，这就打好了语文学习的牢固基础。以识字为先的语文课本，就可以改革成为发展儿童语言、丰富儿童知识的语文课本，不压低他们，不落后于他们。
    所谓“忘其字，写其音”是指写作时有忘记了的写不出来的汉字就把拼音来代替。一般说，这就应该有个条件，就是要照北京的字音拼写，不可随便杂用地方土音，才能全国一致，彼此看了都懂，免使汉语的文字分歧；就是说，推广普通话，统一读音，就正是“忘其字，写其音”的先决条件。因此，像万荣的扫盲，由于阅读注音读物大大地带动了写作，农村诗人和生产队长们拿起笔来，遇有写不出的汉字，要思路不打断，语言的表达不受生字的限制，也只是先用字母拼了音代替，写完后还得再查字典补上汉字。至于小学儿童，一年级开始就能用拼音造句，写短文；也允许孩子们用拼音写较长的入队申请书，那都是初步练习写作的性质，不能说这就是新的拼音文字。关于这一点，在现阶段我还不想多说。
    六十年来中国人民创造汉语拼音字母的工作，“总结”于1958年我们通过的汉语拼音方案；六十年来中国人民用字母拼音来克服汉字困难以提高文化技术水平的期望，也“实现”于今日社会主义建设事业的大跃进。（今年农历“庚子”，六十年前的庚子年曾经有个王照创制了一套“官话合声字母”，当时推行颇广；他的意识还是封建社会的，在技术方面，可也和“先读书，后识字；忘其字，写其音”基本上是一贯的。）
    要办好这件事，文字改革工作者体会到要过好“三关”：一是“领导关”，必须政治挂帅，各地书记亲自领导，全党动手，全民动员，统一认识，明确方向，把注音识字的学习密切结合着生产，就是说，要生产带动学习，学习又促进生产。这样，没有不胜利成功的。二是“师资关”，据湖北省注音扫盲试点东方红棉织厂的经验，过去一般认为注音扫盲的师资须具有语音知识，能正确流利地说普通话，事实证明，这种看法是脱离实际的，他们只有重点班的一个教师是短期训练班出来的，其余都是该厂职员和工人，只学了三天拼音字母，先做辅导员，不久任主讲教师教得很好。现在像福建、山东两省和四川荣县等地培训民师，本着“以民教民，能者为师”的方针，尽先大量地高速度地学会字母拼音，一方面大力地逐渐地提高教学质量，所以这第二关也并不难过。三是“注音读物关”，这在目前确是十分紧迫的问题，必须千方百计地多想办法做到及时的充分的供应。
    总之，在党的正确领导下，文字改革工作是为文化革命、技术革新和技术革命服务，是参加在改革工具和改进方法的斗争中的，目标就在保证教育、科学和文化事业更好地配合和促进工农业生产的大跃进。
