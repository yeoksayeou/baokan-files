Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 17th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, "Lao Patriotic News" reported on April 12th that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front requested the governments of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina and the government of India to support the recent proposal by the Lao Patriotic Front for both sides in Laos to cease military activities during the upcoming parliamentary elections.

The Lao Patriotic Front also requested the governments of these countries to intervene with the Lao Royal Government to ensure that the elections reflect the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and to create conditions for stabilizing the situation in Laos through peaceful negotiations.

The Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's request was made in a letter it wrote on March 24th to the governments of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference and to the government of India, which chairs the International Control and Supervision Commission for Indochina.

The letter also condemned the US imperialists and their running dogs in Laos for suppressing the legitimate aspirations of the Lao people by force and for preparing to hold deceptive elections, which would further escalate the tensions in Laos.

Attached to the letter was a copy of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's letter of March 24th to the Lao Royal Government. This letter suggested taking practical measures to achieve a cessation of military activities, first by the Royal Government releasing Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and then by both sides holding peaceful negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 17th: "Lao Patriotic News" published on April 12th a letter from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, dated March 24th, to the Soviet Foreign Minister and the British Foreign Secretary, requesting the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to "take the most practical measures to restore calm to Laos, thereby creating favorable conditions for the upcoming general elections there."

"Lao Patriotic News" said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front informed the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference in the letter of the Lao Patriotic Front's recent proposal to the Royal Government, namely: that both sides cease military activities, so that the April 24th general election can be held under normal circumstances.

The letter stated, "The Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's peaceful proposal reflects the sincere wishes of the Lao people."

The letter continued, "The upcoming election in Laos is being prepared by the running dogs of US imperialism, the heads of the 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests' serving in the Royal Government, under the threat of bayonets and in the midst of a serious civil war. This situation can only make the situation in Laos even more tense."

The letter stated, "The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front requests the two chairmen to pay attention to the ceasefire proposal put forward by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and to take the most practical measures to restore calm to Laos, so that the election can be held under favorable conditions and help restore peace to Laos in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements."

Phaidang Lobliayao, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, recently condemned US imperialists for intensifying their intervention in Laos in an interview with a "Lao Patriotic News" reporter, thereby creating obstacles to holding normal elections in Laos.

    老挝爱国战线党还要求这些国家的政府出面对老挝王国政府进行干预，使选举能够反映日内瓦协议和万象协议的精神，为通过和平谈判来使老挝局势稳定创造条件。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的要求是在它3月24日写给日内瓦会议参加国政府和担任印度支那国际监察和监督委员会主席的印度政府的信中提出来的。
    信中还谴责美帝国主义者及其在老挝的走狗用武力压制老挝人民的合法愿望，并且正在准备举行欺骗性选举，使老挝局势更加紧张。
    信中附有老挝爱国战线党中央委员会3月24日写给老挝王国政府的信件副本。这封信建议采取实际措施来实现停止军事活动，首先是王国政府方面释放苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其它领导人，并且双方举行和平谈判。
