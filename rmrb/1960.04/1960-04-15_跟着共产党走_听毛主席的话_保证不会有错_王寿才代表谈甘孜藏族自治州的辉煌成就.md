Comrades Chairman and fellow Representatives:
I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I will resolutely implement them.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, and inspired by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, with the vigorous support of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Han people, the people of all ethnic groups in our Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, through active efforts and arduous struggles, have achieved decisive victories in socialist transformation on the basis of eliminating the feudal serf system and thoroughly completing democratic reform. All aspects of production and construction have achieved brilliant accomplishments, and the social landscape has undergone fundamental changes.

Democratic Reform is an Inevitable Process for All Ethnic Groups in Feudal Serf Society to Move Towards Socialism

The successful completion of the democratic reform has enabled the broad masses of working people to obtain land and other means of production, greatly liberating the productive forces. Poor farmers and herdsmen, who account for more than 70% of the total population, have formed a political advantage. Counter-revolutionaries and reactionary forces have been severely打击d, and the revolutionary order and people's democratic power in rural and pastoral areas have been further consolidated. In the actual exercise of class struggle over the past few years, a large number of activists have emerged, and a large number of cadres from the local ethnic groups have been trained and promoted. These Party members, League members, cadres, and activists have a flesh-and-blood connection with the local people, which enables the Party's various guidelines and policies to penetrate the hearts of the people more smoothly. This has opened up broad prospects for the rapid development of socialist transformation and production and construction. Practice has proven that democratic reform is an inevitable process for all ethnic groups in feudal serf society to move towards socialism. Without democratic reform, we would not have this brand new situation today. To completely change the state of poverty and backwardness, we must continue to advance along the socialist road. Practice has also proven that anti-feudal democratic reform, no matter what method is adopted, is a world-shaking social revolution, and no reactionary ruling class will automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Democratic reform is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle, and it is necessary to resolutely implement the class line, fully mobilize, organize, and arm the people to liberate themselves, and rely on the unity of all ethnic groups and the help and support of advanced ethnic groups. However, these fundamental issues were not fully understood by all of us for a certain period of time. In the entire process of democratic reform in our prefecture, especially before the masses were fully mobilized, in addition to the strong resistance from the hostile classes, there were also different arguments within us about whether or not to reform and who to rely on for reform. Some right-leaning opportunists and those with serious right-leaning and local nationalist ideas once envisioned solving the problem of democratic revolution without going through reform or adopting reformist methods, and without going through fierce class struggle. In fact, this can only be a completely unattainable fantasy. Our Party led the people of all ethnic groups to resolutely oppose and criticize this erroneous proposition in a timely manner, adhere to the correct class line, and thoroughly complete the task of feudal democratic reform.

Once Democratic Reform Ended, the Cooperative Movement Developed Rapidly

With the completion of democratic reform, the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry has also achieved decisive victories. According to the principle of continuous revolution, and in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee on closely linking the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, we combined the victory of democratic reform with extensive education on the socialist future for farmers and herdsmen, paid attention to improving their socialist awareness, and guided them to cooperation in a timely manner. Therefore, in all areas, the cooperative movement developed rapidly and vigorously as soon as the democratic reform ended. Not long after the completion of democratic reform, cooperation was realized in agricultural areas; the development of the cooperative movement in pastoral areas was also very rapid. The people of all ethnic groups generally referred to the victory of democratic reform and the realization of cooperation as "double happiness," saying that "democratic reform liberated people, and organization liberated the land." The cooperatives that have been established have generally increased production by 30% to 50%, or even doubled, compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives, ensuring that more than 90% of the members increase their income. For example, the results of the 1959 final settlement of the Yidun County Cooperative showed that 97.3% of the farmers' households increased their income, and only 3.7% maintained or reduced their income due to illness or lack of labor. About 80% of the cooperatives in Kangding, Danba, Daofu, Jiulong and other counties have caught up with or exceeded the production and income level of the local average middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. The great superiority of organization vigorously promotes the consolidation and development of cooperation. Last winter and this spring, after the widespread socialist education movement in the countryside, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people for socialism was even higher, and they universally and urgently demanded the establishment of people's communes. According to the requirements of the masses and the actual situation, the Prefecture Party Committee is planning and piloting a number of people's communes. We believe that linking the two different stages of revolution, democratic reform and socialist transformation, and actively and step by step, from elementary to advanced cooperatives, and then to people's communes, is in line with the actual situation in our Ganzi region and the actual interests of the people of all ethnic groups; it is also in line with the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country.

The Liberated and Organized People of All Ethnic Groups Have an Unprecedentedly High Enthusiasm for Production

The victory of democratic reform and socialist transformation has created extremely favorable conditions for the development of production in all aspects. The liberated and organized people of all ethnic groups have an unprecedentedly high enthusiasm for production. In order to change the backwardness of production and the poverty of life as soon as possible, everyone is high-spirited and energetic, and everyone is full of energy, resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, breaking down the old rules and bad habits that affect the development of production, and implementing advanced farming methods. A massive and magnificent upsurge of mass tool reform, large-scale water conservancy construction, and large-scale accumulation and manufacture of fertilizer has already formed in our prefecture. There are many natural fertilizers and wide sources of water in the Ganzi area, but in the past, due to the shackles of various superstitious ideas, they have long been wasted in vain. For example, in the past, it was said that there were mountain gods in the mountains, and it was forbidden to go to the mountains to accumulate fertilizer; if fertilizers were applied to crops, the harvested grain could not be offered to Bodhisattvas; water had water gods, and it was forbidden to build water conservancy projects, and so on. Therefore, in the past, farming was mostly "white planting and white harvesting," and in the very few places where fertilizer was applied, the maximum amount was no more than three or five hundred catties per mu; now fertilizer is generally applied, and in 1959 the average application per mu was more than 8,000 catties, and some areas reached more than 20,000 catties. In the past, even fewer water conservancy irrigation projects were implemented. Now, not only are all areas vigorously building water conservancy projects, but some areas have basically realized water conservancy. The extensive farming methods are constantly being improved, and the phenomenon of "slash-and-burn" has long been eliminated. The ancient and backward wooden plow has been generally replaced by the new-style step plow, and broadcasting has been changed to strip planting with seed selection and soaking. The agricultural production increase movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution has developed vigorously in our prefecture.

Hard work has yielded brilliant fruits. In 1959, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output increased by 40.9% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. At the same time, large-scale high-yield and multi-crop high-yield models appeared on the plateau: 480 mu of wheat in Danba County reached more than 500 catties per mu, and 300 mu of corn in Jiulong County averaged 1,000 catties per mu. In particular, in Litang, which is nearly 5,000 meters above sea level, and other areas where crops had never been grown in the past, the trial planting of yuan gen (a kind of tuber) and potatoes yielded more than 10,000 catties per mu, thus breaking the superstition that "agricultural production cannot be developed in high-altitude and cold areas," liberating the minds of the working people, and setting up a banner, which further stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for production and played a great role in promoting the continued leap forward in agriculture. In addition, animal husbandry, diversified management and other undertakings have also shown a thriving new situation.

The Lives of the Working People Have Been Significantly Improved on the Basis of Production Development

With the development of production, the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of working people have been significantly improved, and their class consciousness and socialist consciousness have been greatly enhanced. Now the average agricultural population in the prefecture has 800 catties of grain per person, an increase of 87.35% compared to 427 catties in 1955 before the reform (not deducting the figures exploited by the landlords at that time). Although this is insignificant compared to the advanced ethnic areas in the country, it is a great and inspiring thing for our prefecture. Due to the development of production, the purchasing power of the people has also greatly increased, and the improvement of life is very significant. For example, Dawa, a farmer from Zako Township in Ganzi, in the long years of the serf system in the past, spent most of his time every year farming, chopping firewood, and grazing for the serf owners. During the busy farming season, he could only return home in the middle of the night to rush to plant his own small piece of "distributed land." The grain he harvested every year would be gone after four or five months. In order to survive, he borrowed a bag of grain from the serf owner in the spring and had to return one and a half bags in the autumn; once he couldn't borrow it, he had to endure hunger or beg along the village. At that time, his family's entire property consisted of only an old sheepskin for him and his wife, a thousand-patched woolen shirt, a clay stove, a clay teapot, and a broken cabinet. The great democratic reform and socialist transformation brought happiness and joy to the serfs. In the year of the victory of democratic reform, he joined the mutual aid group and then joined the cooperative. In 1958, he was allocated more than 30 bags (each bag is 60 catties) of grain, and his income increased greatly last year. His family is now not a question of whether there is food to eat, but how to eat better. In the past two years, he, his wife, and his children have added one new piece of clothing after another. Dawa's past and present is just one of the millions of working people.

The system of class exploitation is the social root cause of disunity between and within ethnic groups. The great democratic reform movement dug up this bad root. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture have been united unprecedentedly on the basis of equality, mutual assistance, and common development. Socialist ethnic relations of mutual learning, mutual support, common labor, and common development are being formed and developed.

In summary, after the successful completion of democratic reform, the socialist transformation and the development of various production and construction undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups in our Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are at high speed, and the achievements are very great. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, and a great victory for the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Everyone deeply realizes from countless specific facts that only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the only saviors of the people of all ethnic groups. "Following the Communist Party and listening to Chairman Mao's words guarantees that you won't go wrong." This simple language is the voice of the broad masses of working people, and it reflects the working people's infinite trust in the Party and Chairman Mao. At present, the people of the entire prefecture are in high spirits, fighting spirit, and with a master attitude, abundant energy, and soaring energy, and are confidently moving forward to seize a better and more comprehensive victory in 1960 on the basis of the victories already achieved. Of course, the people of all ethnic groups understand that their tasks are very arduous, the struggle is still very sharp and complex, and there are still many difficulties on the road ahead. However, we firmly believe that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, mobilize the masses more widely and deeply, rely on the masses, and further boost the soaring energy of the people of all ethnic groups, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead, realize a better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward, and change the "poorer and whiter" state of our prefecture as soon as possible.

    跟着共产党走　听毛主席的话　保证不会有错
    王寿才代表谈甘孜藏族自治州的辉煌成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，以及人大常务委员会的工作报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我们甘孜藏族自治州各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在四川省委的直接领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社化的鼓舞下，在全国各族人民特别是汉族人民的大力支援下，经过积极努力和艰苦奋战的结果，在消灭了封建农奴制度、彻底完成民主改革的基础上，社会主义改造已取得了决定性的胜利，各项生产建设事业获得了辉煌成就，社会面貌已经发生了根本变化。
    民主改革是处在封建农奴社会中
    各民族走向社会主义的必经过程
    民主改革的胜利完成，使广大劳动人民群众获得了土地和其它生产资料，大大解放了生产力；占总人口70％以上的贫苦农牧民在政治上形成了优势；反革命分子和反动势力受到了沉重的打击，农村、牧区的革命秩序和人民民主政权更进一步得到了巩固。在几年来阶级斗争的实际锻炼中，涌现出了大批积极分子，培养提拔了大批本民族出身的各级干部；普遍建立了党团的基层组织。这批党团员、干部和积极分子同当地人民群众有着血肉般的联系，因而，能够使党的各项方针、政策更加顺利地深入人心，这就为社会主义改造和生产建设事业的迅速发展开辟了广阔的道路。实践证明：民主改革是处在封建农奴社会中的各民族走向社会主义的必经过程。没有民主改革就没有我们今天这个崭新的局面。要彻底改变贫困落后状态，必须沿着社会主义道路继续前进。实践还证明，反封建的民主改革不论采取什么方法都是一场翻天复地的社会革命，任何反动统治阶级决不会自动退出历史舞台。民主改革是一场极其尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，必须坚决贯彻执行阶级路线，充分发动组织和武装人民群众起来自我解放，并依靠各民族人民的团结，先进民族的帮助和支持。但是这些根本性的问题在一定时期内，并不是为我们所有的人都完全理解的。在我州民主改革的整个过程中，特别是群众没有充分发动起来之前，除了来自敌对阶级的强烈反抗外，在我们内部对于改不改革，依靠谁改革，也曾有过不同的争论。一些右倾机会主义者以及严重右倾和地方民族主义思想严重的人，曾设想不经过改革或者采取改良主义的办法，不通过激烈的阶级斗争来解决民主革命问题，事实上这只能是一种完全不可能达到的幻想。我们党领导各族人民群众，及时地坚决地反对和批判了这种错误的主张，坚持正确阶级路线，彻底完成了封建的民主改革任务。
    民主改革一经结束，合作化运动迅速发展起来
    随着民主改革的完成，农牧业的社会主义改造也已获得了决定性的胜利。根据不断革命的原理，遵照省委关于把民主革命和社会主义革命紧密联系起来的指示，我们结合民主改革的胜利，广泛地对农牧民进行了社会主义的前途教育，注意提高他们的社会主义觉悟，及时引导到合作化方面来。因此，各地都是在民主改革一经结束，合作化运动就迅速地蓬勃发展起来。民主改革完成不久，在农业地区就实现了合作化；牧业地区合作化运动的发展也很迅速。各族人民普遍地把民主改革的胜利和合作化的实现称为“双喜临门”，说“民主改革人翻身，组织起来地翻身”。凡建立起来的合作社，一般都较建社前增产30％至50％，甚至一两倍，保证了90％以上的社员增加收入。例如义敦全县合作社1959年决算的结果，97.3％的农户都增加了收入，因病或因缺乏劳动力而保持或减少收入的仅占3.7％。康定、丹巴、道孚、九龙等县已有80％左右的合作社，赶上或超过了当地一般中农或富裕中农的生产和收入水平。组织起来的巨大优越性有力地促进着合作化的巩固和发展。去冬今春，在农村中广泛开展社会主义教育运动以后，广大人民群众奔向社会主义的热情更加高涨，普遍而迫切的要求建立人民公社，州委根据群众要求和实际情况有计划地正在试办一批人民公社。我们认为把民主改革和社会主义改造这两个性质不同的革命阶段紧密联系起来，并积极地有步骤地，由初级到高级合作社，再到人民公社，这是符合我们甘孜地区的实际情况和各族人民的实际利益的；也是和全国大跃进的形势相适应的。
    解放了的、组织起来的各族人民生产积极性空前高涨
    民主改革和社会主义改造的胜利，在各方面都为发展生产创造了极为有利的条件。解放了的、组织起来的各族人民，生产积极性空前高涨，为了尽快改变生产落后和生活贫困的状态，人人意气风发，个个干劲冲天，坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，大破影响生产发展的陈规陋习，实行先进的耕作方法，一个声势浩大、波澜壮阔的群众性的大搞工具改革、大兴水利和大搞积肥造肥的高潮在我州已经形成。甘孜地区的自然肥料很多，水源很广，但过去由于各种迷信思想的束缚，长期以来，一直是把它们白白的浪费掉了。比如，过去说山有山神，不准进山积肥，庄稼施了肥，打下的粮食不能敬菩萨；水有水神，不准修水利等等。因而，以前种地多是“白种白收”，极少数施肥的地方，最多每亩也不超过三、五百斤；现在已经普遍施肥，1959年平均每亩已施到八千多斤，一部分地区达到两万斤以上。以前实行水利灌溉的更少，现在不但各地都在大力兴修水利，而且部分地区已基本实现了水利化。粗放的耕作方法不断在改进，“刀耕火种”现象早已消灭。普遍以新式步犁代替了古老的落后的木犁，改撒播为条播实行选种浸种。以技术革新和技术革命为中心的农业增产运动已在我州蓬勃发展。
    辛勤的劳动，结出了辉煌的硕果，1959年农业生产获得了史无前例的大丰收，粮食总产量在1958年大跃进的基础上又增产40.9％，同时在高原上出现了大面积高产和多种作物的丰产典型：丹巴县四百八十亩小麦亩产达到五百余斤，九龙县三百亩玉米平均每亩达到一千斤。特别是在海拔近五千米的理塘和其它过去向来未种过农作物的地区，试种的元根（一种薯类）和洋芋亩产均达到了万斤以上，因此，破除了“高寒地区不能发展农业生产”的迷信，解放了劳动人民的思想，树立了旗帜，进一步激发了群众的生产积极性，为农业的继续跃进起了极大的推动作用。此外畜牧业、多种经营等其它各项事业，都出现了一个欣欣向荣的崭新局面。
    劳动人民的生活在生产发展的基础上获得了显著的改善
    随着生产的发展，广大劳动人民的物质文化生活获得了显著的改善，阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟大大提高。现在全州农业人口平均每人有粮达八百斤，较改革前1955年的四百二十七斤（没有减去当时被地主剥削的数字）增加87.35％。这虽然与全国先进民族地区相比微不足道，但是，对我州来说，已是一件振奋人心的大好事。由于生产发展了，人民群众的购买力也大大提高，生活的改善是很显著的。例如，甘孜扎科乡农民达娃，在过去漫长的农奴制度的岁月里，他每年大部分的时间，都去给农奴主种地、砍柴、放牧，农忙时只能半夜回家抢种自己的一点点“分地”，每年所收的粮食吃四、五个月就没有了，为了活命，春天向农奴主借一袋粮食，秋天要还一袋半；一旦借不到，就只得忍饥挨饿，或者沿村乞讨。那时，他家的全部财产，只有他和妻子每人一件老羊皮，一件千巴万补的毪衫，一个坭火炉，一把坭茶壶和一个破柜。伟大的民主改革和社会主义改造给农奴们带来了幸福和愉快。民主改革胜利的当年，他参加了互助组，接着加入了合作社。1958年分得了三十多袋（每袋合六十斤）粮食，去年收入又有很大增加，他家现在已不是有饭吃没有饭吃的问题而是如何吃得更好。近两年来，他和妻子、孩子每个人都添置了一件又一件的新衣服。达娃的过去和现在，只不过是千千万万劳动人民中间的一个。
    阶级剥削制度是产生民族间和民族内部不团结的社会根源。伟大的民主改革运动挖掉了这个坏根子。现在，我州各族人民已经在平等互助，共同发展的基础上，空前团结起来了。互相学习，互相支援，共同劳动，共同发展的社会主义民族关系正在形成和发展。
    总上所述，我们甘孜藏族自治州各族人民继胜利完成民主改革之后，社会主义改造和各项生产建设事业的发展是高速度的，取得的成绩是很大的。这是毛主席民族政策的伟大胜利，是党的总路线，大跃进，人民公社的伟大胜利。大家从无数的具体事实中深深体会到只有共产党和毛主席才是各族人民唯一的救星。“跟着共产党走，听毛主席的话，保证不会有错”，这个朴素的语言就是广大劳动人民的声音，它反映了劳动人民对党和毛主席的无比信赖。目前我们全州人民正在已经取得的胜利的基础上精神振奋，斗志昂扬，以主人翁的态度，充沛的精力和冲天的干劲，信心百倍地为夺取1960年更好更全面的胜利而奋勇前进。当然我们各族人民懂得自己的任务十分艰巨，斗争还很尖锐、复杂，在前进的道路上还有不少困难，但是我们坚信，只要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社，更加广泛深入地发动群众，依靠群众，进一步鼓足各族人民的冲天干劲，就一定能够克服前进道路上的困难，实现更好更全面的持续跃进，尽快地改变我州“更穷更白”的状态。
