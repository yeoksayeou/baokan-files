Peaceful Coexistence and Class Struggle
Summary of an Article from the Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" on February 28th

Editor's Note: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an article on February 28th discussing "Peaceful Coexistence and Class Struggle." Here is an excerpt:

I. The Relationship Between the Struggle to Achieve Peaceful Coexistence and Class Struggle

When we speak of peaceful coexistence, we do not mean that international relations in the world are already based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Currently, there are still the most reactionary forces in the United States and other forces conspiring to continue the "Cold War policy," and they are all opposed to peaceful coexistence. Adenauer of West Germany and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet of Japan are representatives of these forces. Therefore, for us, it is not that peaceful coexistence has already been achieved, but that we must continue to strive for its realization in the future. So, the important thing at present is to clarify the relationship between the struggle to achieve peaceful coexistence and class struggle.

The struggle to achieve peaceful coexistence is one of the goals of the struggle to defend world peace. Therefore, the relationship between the struggle for peaceful coexistence and class struggle is actually the question of the relationship between the peace movement and class struggle. Although the peace movement itself is not a class struggle aimed at overthrowing capitalism, it plays an extremely important role in developing such class struggle. In this movement, we can explain the essence of imperialist countries and the reasons why they wage wars of aggression, and at the same time, we can also explain the essence of socialist countries that adopt peaceful policies. This will inevitably raise the class consciousness of the masses and expand the front of class struggle.

II. What Changes Will Occur in Class Relations After International Relations Based on the Principle of Peaceful Coexistence are Established in the World?

As many people have said, even if peaceful coexistence is achieved in international relations, there can be no peaceful coexistence in terms of ideology. As an inevitable law of social development, colonialism cannot but collapse, and capitalism cannot but transition to socialism. Communists are fighting to achieve this goal, and we cannot abandon Marxism-Leninism. Of course, capitalists are opposed to this, and the struggle in ideology will continue to exist even under established peaceful coexistence in international relations.

Therefore, even after the realization of peaceful coexistence between nations, there is still a constant danger of sabotage of this relationship coming from the capitalist camp. The struggle by peaceful forces to prevent this danger cannot be relaxed even after peaceful coexistence is achieved.

So, what impact will such international relations have on the class struggle in various countries?

As long as capitalism continues to exist, exploitation and class rule will also continue to exist, and the working class's struggle against this exploitation and rule will not weaken because of peaceful coexistence.

On the contrary, under the conditions of peaceful coexistence, the superiority of socialism over capitalism will become increasingly apparent. As a result, among workers in capitalist countries, the idea of longing for socialism will develop further. The working class will see through the contradictions of capitalism more clearly, and the working class's struggle against capitalists will be further strengthened.

When the contradictions of capitalism deepen, the struggle of the working class strengthens, and the revolutionary situation matures, if the bourgeoisie wants to suppress the struggle of the working class and the majority of the people who support the working class by violence, then an inevitable revolutionary civil war will break out, in which the revolutionary people, led by the working class, will use force to overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie. This is a matter of a country's internal affairs and does not violate the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

Conversely, in such a revolutionary situation, if a foreign country, such as the United States, wants to intervene under the pretext of "indirect aggression" and suppress revolutionary forces, that is interference in internal affairs and a violation of the spirit of peaceful coexistence. Under the conditions of peaceful coexistence, the conditions for preventing such foreign interference in internal affairs will also be more favorable. In this respect, peaceful coexistence will also prepare favorable conditions for revolution, that is, social development based on the laws of historical development.

### 和平共处和阶级斗争  日共“赤旗报”二月二十八日的文章摘要

    和平共处和阶级斗争
    日共“赤旗报”二月二十八日的文章摘要
    编者按：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”在2月28日刊登了一篇论“和平共处和阶级斗争”的文章。现摘译如下：一、争取实现和平共处的斗争与阶级斗争的关系
    我们说和平共处，并不是说现在世界上的国际关系，已经基于不同的社会制度的国家和平共处原则建立了起来。目前，世界上还有美国的最反动的势力和其它阴谋继续执行“冷战政策”的势力存在，它们都在反对和平共处。西德的阿登纳和日本的岸信介内阁就是其中的代表。因此对于我们来说，不是和平共处已经实现了，而是今后必须继续争取实现的问题，所以目前重要的是，弄清楚争取实现和平共处的斗争与阶级斗争的关系。
    争取实现和平共处的斗争，是保卫世界和平斗争的一个目标。所以和平共处的斗争同阶级斗争的关系，实际上就是和平运动同阶级斗争的关系问题。和平运动本身虽然不是以打倒资本主义为目的的阶级斗争，但是它在发展这样的阶级斗争方面，却起着极其重要的作用。我们可以在这个运动中说明帝国主义国家的本质和它进行侵略战争的原因，同时也可以说明采取和平政策的社会主义国家的本质，这就必然能够提高群众的阶级觉悟，扩大阶级斗争的战线。
    二、在世界上建立了以和平共处的原则为基础的
    国际关系之后，阶级关系将发生怎样的变化
    正如许多人所说的那样，即使在国际关系方面实现了和平共处，在思想意识方面也决不可能有和平共处。作为社会发展的必然规律，殖民主义不能不崩溃，资本主义也不能不过渡到社会主义。共产主义者就是为了实现这一目的而进行着斗争，我们不能放弃马克思列宁主义。当然，资本家对此是反对的，思想意识的斗争，即使是在建立了和平共处的国际关系的情况下，仍然是继续存在的。
    因此，即使是在实现了国际之间的和平共处之后，仍有不断地来自资本主义阵营方面的破坏这种关系的危险。和平势力为制止出现这种危险而进行的斗争，在实现和平共处之后，也决不能松懈。
    那么，这样的国际关系对各国的阶级斗争又有怎样的影响呢？
    只要资本主义继续存在，剥削关系和阶级统治也将继续存在，工人阶级反对这种剥削和统治的斗争也是不会因和平共处而减弱的。
    相反，在和平共处的条件下，社会主义对资本主义的优势地位将会表现得日益明显。结果，在资本主义国家的工人中间，向往社会主义的思想将更加发展。工人阶级会更清楚地看穿资本主义的矛盾，工人阶级对资本家的斗争，也将进一步加强。
    在资本主义的矛盾加深了，工人阶级的斗争加强了，革命形势成熟了的时候，如果资产阶级想以暴力镇压工人阶级和支持工人阶级的大多数人民的斗争，那么就不可避免地将发生革命的内战，即以工人阶级为首的革命的人民就会以实力来打倒资产阶级的统治，这是一个国家的内政问题，毫不违反和平共处的精神。
    相反地，在这样的革命形势下，如果外国，譬如美国要以“间接侵略”为借口进行干涉，镇压革命力量，那就是干涉内政，是违反和平共处的精神的。在和平共处的条件下，阻止外国这样干涉内政的条件也将更加有利。从这方面来说，和平共处也将为革命，即基于历史发展规律的社会发展——准备下有利的条件。
