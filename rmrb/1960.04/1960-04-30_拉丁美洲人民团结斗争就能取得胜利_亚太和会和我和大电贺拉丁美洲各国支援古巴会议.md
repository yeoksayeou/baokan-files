The telegram said: "In extending our congratulations to your conference, we first pay our respects to the heroic Cuban people, the Cuban Revolution, and the Latin American countries united in the struggle against US imperialism.

This conference in support of Cuba marks the firm determination of all Latin American peoples to unite closely, defend independence and national sovereignty, and oppose the common enemy—US imperialism.

The people of the Asian and Pacific regions, who are victims of US imperialist aggression and war policies, express their full support and deep respect for the just struggle of the Cuban people. The unity and mutual support among the Latin American peoples, as well as their solidarity with peace-loving people all over the world, are the guarantees for the victory of the struggle against imperialism and for the defense of national sovereignty. The convening of this conference will further strengthen the struggle of the Latin American peoples and make a greater contribution to defeating the aggression and war forces of US imperialism, striving for complete national independence, and defending world peace.

The heroic spirit displayed by the Cuban people in the struggle against US imperialism has greatly inspired the Latin American people and the people of all countries in the world. Inspired and influenced by the Cuban Revolution, the struggle of the Latin American people against US imperialism, for safeguarding national independence, and for striving for democracy is further and rapidly unfolding with the force of a prairie fire. The just struggle of the Cuban and Latin American people has dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialist war forces and has made a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace. Your struggle is an important component of the common struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for world peace and has won strong support from the broad masses of people in all countries of the world.

"We see with admiration that, faced with US imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, the Latin American people are closely united and further strengthening their struggle, especially launching a powerful movement to support the Cuban people and defend the Cuban Revolution. We, the Chinese people, sincerely hope that this great and far-reaching movement of the Latin American people will develop more widely and powerfully. The convening of this conference in support of Cuba will once again demonstrate the determination and strength of the Latin American people to support each other, unite, and oppose US imperialist aggression.

"The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban and Latin American people. We regard your struggle as our own and your victory as our own. The 650 million Chinese people will always stand by the Cuban and Latin American people. The Chinese people are determined to fight unremittingly alongside the Cuban and Latin American people against the common enemy, US imperialism. We firmly believe that, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the heroic Cuban and Latin American people, who are strongly united and waging an unyielding struggle, will surely continue to achieve victory and completely defeat US imperialism's aggression and intervention in Latin America.

"We wish the conference success."
