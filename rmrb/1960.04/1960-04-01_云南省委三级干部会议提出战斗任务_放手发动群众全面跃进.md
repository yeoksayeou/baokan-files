The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Three-Level Cadre Meeting Proposes Combat Tasks: Boldly Mobilize the Masses for a Comprehensive Leap Forward

(Reported by our newspaper) The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, at its recent three-level cadre meeting, presented the combat tasks for 1960 to Party organizations and the people throughout the province: Under the great red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, boldly mobilize the masses to continue the leap forward better and more comprehensively on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward. The meeting summarized the rich experience of implementing a series of "walking on two legs" policies in socialist construction. It also made arrangements for the current three major tasks in rural work and agricultural production: managing grain well, and running canteens well.

This three-level cadre meeting started on February 20 and ended on March 15. At the meeting, Comrade Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, delivered an important speech, and Comrade Yu Yichuan, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, delivered a report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee entitled "Hold High the Three Great Treasures, Boldly Mobilize the Masses, and Strive to Achieve a Sustained Leap Forward in 1960."

The meeting believed that thanks to adhering to the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, Yunnan Province, like the rest of the country, achieved a great victory in the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1959. The total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 20.3% in that year. Although the province suffered severe drought and flood disasters in 1959, the total agricultural output value still increased by 19.7% compared to 1958.

The meeting believed that the current situation in the province is excellent, one of prosperity and vigor. The continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years has not only proven that agriculture and animal husbandry can develop at high speed, but also that high-speed and comprehensive agricultural development must take grain as the key link, combine grain and livestock, and actively develop diversified operations. The continuous leap forward in 1960 must firmly implement this policy.

The meeting believed that to increase grain production at high speed, it is also necessary to adopt the "high yield and more harvest" and "multiple planting and more harvest" policies of walking on two legs.

Yunnan has very good conditions and great potential for implementing high yield and multiple planting. At present, the province's cultivated land area accounts for only 70.5% of the total land area, and each agricultural person has only 2.7 mu of cultivated land. According to preliminary investigations, there are more than 14 million mu of land that can be reclaimed immediately in river valley basins alone. Last winter and this spring, the province launched a mass land reclamation campaign, opening up more than 7.4 million mu of wasteland, expanding the province's cultivated land area by 18%. This year, the province will expand rice cultivation by 1.5 million to 2 million mu, expand corn cultivation by 2 million to 2.5 million mu, and increase the planting of 3 million mu of high-yield feed. In addition, the planting plans for potatoes and miscellaneous grains will be expanded accordingly. The planting area for spring crops has also been expanded by about 30% compared to last year. Half of Yunnan's grain production increase plan this year will rely on expanding the cultivated land area.

At present, the yield per unit area in Yunnan is extremely unbalanced: on the one hand, 15% of the high-yield fields have emerged (rice yield per mu is over 800 jin, corn yield per mu is over 400 jin), five counties have emerged with rice yields of 800 jin and 1,000 jin, five counties have emerged with corn yields of 500 jin or 700 jin per mu, and one county has emerged with wheat yields of 500 jin per mu; however, on the other hand, cultivation is extensive, and yields per unit area are very low, and this is not a small number. Therefore, it is even more necessary to carry out a large-scale high-yield campaign, and strive to have 5 million mu of rice with a yield of over 800 jin per mu, 4 million mu of corn with a yield of over 400 jin per mu, and 1 million mu of potatoes with a yield of over 5,000 jin per mu this year. In terms of grain varieties, equal importance should be given to rice and corn. In addition, the province is currently improving 5 million mu of soil and leveling land and converting terraces into terraced fields on 2 million mu. These will promote a rapid increase in yield per unit area, and the potential of the land will be further realized.

The meeting believed that to achieve high-speed development of production, we should adhere to the promotion of advanced technical measures centered on rational close planting. The promotion of advanced technical measures in agricultural production should always be combined with adapting to local conditions. Especially because Yunnan's climate and soil conditions are very complex, adapting to local conditions is particularly important. However, adhering to advanced techniques and promoting advanced techniques is always the main and fundamental thing. The meeting believed that at present, there is still great potential for rational close planting in every region of the province, and all localities should conscientiously summarize experience, stipulate the most suitable specifications at present, and resolutely promote them. In addition, a series of measures such as selecting, replacing, and promoting improved varieties, deep plowing, and tool reform must be constantly innovated.

The meeting discussed the development of animal husbandry and the development of diversified operations. In the development of animal husbandry, pigs must be the first priority, and at the same time, based on Yunnan's characteristics, the policy of giving equal importance to pigs and sheep and promoting the prosperity of the six livestock was put forward.

The meeting believed that to continue the high-speed development of industry, it is necessary to better implement the policy of "walking on two legs." In the future, the province's industry should adopt the policy of grasping both ends (i.e., grasping the key industries belonging to the central government and the province, and actively developing commune-run industries) and arranging the middle (i.e., arranging the development of special county industries according to the needs of the above two aspects). "Grasping both ends and arranging the middle" is actually the specific implementation of a series of policies of "giving equal importance to central and local industries," "giving equal importance to large, medium, and small industries," and "giving equal importance to indigenous and foreign methods" in Yunnan Province's industrial layout. While ensuring the backbone industries belonging to the central government and the province, we will actively develop commune-run industries, and gradually ensure that every people's commune (generally a large commune of 30,000 to 50,000 people) establishes a set of small-scale industries, including small power stations, small coal mines, farm tool factories, small phosphate fertilizer plants, sugar refineries, oil presses, grain processing plants, non-staple food processing plants, brick and tile factories, etc. These commune-run industries will directly serve agricultural production and liberate agricultural labor. Gradually realizing the industrialization of communes will further promote the high-speed development of industry and the technical transformation of agriculture, and rapidly increase the economic and public accumulation at the commune level. Special county industries should serve as assistants to the central and provincial industries, and at the same time as the backbone of the commune-run industries.

With the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, the corresponding development of transportation has become a very urgent issue. During the First Five-Year Plan period, Yunnan Province's industrial production increased by two times, and the freight volume of modern transportation tools increased by four times. The ratio of the growth of industrial output value to the freight volume of modern transportation was one to two. According to the experience of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the ratio of the speed of industrial development to the speed of modern transportation development must reach one to three this year in order to meet the requirements of the growth of the entire national economy. Therefore, the meeting requested the transportation departments to continue to exert greater efforts, actively tap the potential of existing transportation tools, accelerate the construction of railways, and take resolute measures to quickly change the backward state and truly do a good job as the pioneers in the continuous leap forward.

The meeting believed that to achieve this year's continuous Great Leap Forward, the most important and fundamental thing is to require Party cadres throughout the province to conscientiously study Mao Zedong's works. The focus of study should be on leading cadres above the county party committee secretary level, and the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally take the lead in organizing study, and gradually organize a theoretical team with a certain scale and level. Party organizations at all levels must regard this as an important strategic task.

At present, the province has entered the tense spring plowing production season. The meeting believed that in rural areas, we must seize the time to do a good job in the three major tasks of grasping production, managing grain well, and running canteens well. In current production, we must first grasp the implementation of contracted production to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses. The spring drought in the province is continuing to develop, and we must persist in fighting the drought for three and a half months from now on to ensure timely sowing and timely transplanting. In order to implement advanced technical measures centered on close planting, we must make preparations and arrangements now. We must also take a positive attitude and take practical and effective measures to further improve public canteens; in industrial production and capital construction, we must further deepen and widely carry out the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and push the mass movement on the current industrial and agricultural production front to a new peak.

    云南省委三级干部会议提出战斗任务
    放手发动群众全面跃进
    本报讯　中共云南省委在最近举行的三级干部会议上，向全省各级党组织和人民提出了1960年的战斗任务：在连续大跃进的基础上，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，放手发动群众，更好更全面地继续跃进。会议总结了在社会主义建设中贯彻一系列“两条腿走路”的方针的丰富经验。还对当前农村工作和农业生产、管好粮食、办好食堂三件大事作了布置。
    这次三级干部会议是2月20日开始到3月15日结束的。在会上，中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦同志作了重要讲话，省委书记处书记于一川同志代表省委作了“高举三大法宝，放手发动群众，为实现1960年持续跃进而奋斗”的报告。
    会议认为，由于坚持了党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，1959年，云南省和全国一样，取得了连续大跃进的伟大胜利。这一年工农业总产值增长了20.3％。1959年全省虽交错发生了严重的旱涝灾害，但农业总产值仍然比1958年增长了19.7％。
    会议认为当前全省所处的形势，是一个蒸蒸日上，欣欣向荣的大好形势。两年来的连续大跃进，不但证明农业和畜牧业可以高速度发展，而且证明了高速度全面的发展农业，必须以粮为纲、粮畜并举，并积极发展多种经营。1960年的连续跃进必须坚定地贯彻这个方针。
    会议认为高速度增产粮食，还必须采取“高产多收”与“多种多收”相结合的两条腿走路的方针。
    云南贯彻高产和多种的条件很好，潜力也很大。目前全省耕地面积仅占土地总面积的70.5％，每个农业人口只有耕地二点七亩。据初步调查，仅河谷盆地马上可开垦的土地有一千四百多万亩。去冬今春全省开展了全民开荒运动，已开出荒地七百四十多万亩，使全省耕地面积扩大了18％。今年全省将扩大水稻一百五十万至二百万亩，苞谷扩大二百万亩至二百五十万亩，增种三百万亩高产饲料。此外相应地扩大薯类、杂粮的播种计划。小春的种植面积也较去年扩大了30％左右。今年云南全省粮食增产计划，其中有一半要依靠扩大耕地面积来完成。
    云南目前单位面积产量极不平衡：一方面出现了占15％的高产田（稻谷亩产八百斤以上，苞谷亩产四百斤以上），出现了五个水稻八百斤和千斤县，出现了五个苞谷亩产五百斤或七百斤的县，出现了一个小麦亩产五百斤的县；但是另一方面，耕作粗放，单产很低，也还不是少数。因此就更加必要大搞大面积的高产运动，力争今年全省有五百万亩水稻亩产八百斤以上，四百万亩苞谷亩产四百斤以上，一百万亩薯类亩产五千斤以上。在粮食品种上应以水稻和苞谷并重。此外，全省正在改良土壤五百万亩和平整土地、改梯田、梯地二百万亩。这些都将促使单位面积产量有迅速的提高，土地的潜力也将得到进一步的发挥。
    会议认为要实现生产的高速度发展，应坚持推广以合理密植为中心的先进技术措施。在农业生产上推广先进技术措施，任何时候都应与因地制宜相结合。特别由于云南气候、土质情况十分复杂，因而因地制宜尤为重要。但是，坚持先进、推广先进始终是主要的、根本的。会议认为目前全省每个地区的合理密植都还有很大的潜力，各地应当认真地总结经验，规定目前最适合的规格坚决推广。此外，选换和推广良种、深耕、工具改革等一系列措施都要不断地革新。
    会议讨论了发展畜牧业和开展多种经营问题。在发展畜牧业上必须以猪为首，同时根据云南的特点，提出了猪羊并举六畜兴旺的方针。
    会议认为继续高速度的发展工业必须更好的执行“两条腿走路”的方针，今后全省工业应采取抓紧两头（即抓紧中央和省属重点工业，并积极发展社办工业），安排中间（即根据上述两方面的需要，来安排专县工业的发展）的方针。“抓紧两头，安排中间”，实际上就是云南省在工业布局上具体贯彻“中央工业和地方工业并举”、“大中小并举”、“土洋并举”等一系列两条腿走路的方针，在保证中央和省属的骨干工业同时，积极发展社办工业，逐步做到每个人民公社（一般应该是三万人到五万人的大社）都建立一套小型工业，包括小型电站、小煤窑、农具厂、小型磷肥厂、榨糖厂、榨油厂、粮食加工厂、副食品加工厂、砖瓦厂等。这些社办工业将直接为农业生产服务和解放农业劳动力。逐步实现公社工业化，将更加促进工业的高速度发展和农业的技术改造，并使公社一级经济和公共积累迅速增加。专县工业应该作为中央和省属工业的助手，同时又作为社办工业的骨干。
    随着工农业生产的高速度发展，交通运输相应地发展已成为当前十分迫切的问题。第一个五年计划期间，云南省工业生产增长了两倍，现代运输工具的货运量增长了四倍。工业产值与现代运输货运的增长比例为一比二。根据两年大跃进的经验，今年工业发展的速度与现代运输发展的速度比例必须达到一比三，才能适应整个国民经济增长的要求。因此会议要求交通运输部门继续鼓足更大的干劲，积极挖掘现有运输工具潜力，并加速铁路的建设，采取坚决措施，迅速改变落后状态，真正做好连续跃进中的先行官。
    会议认为，要实现今年的连续大跃进，最重要和最根本的一条是：要求全省党的干部认真地学习毛泽东著作。学习的重点应当是县委书记以上的领导干部，各级党委的第一书记都要亲自挂帅领导学习，逐步组织一支具有一定规模和一定水平的理论队伍，各级党组织必须把它当作一个重要的战略任务。
    目前全省已经进入紧张的春耕生产季节。会议认为：在农村中必须抓紧时间，做好抓紧生产、管好粮食和办好食堂三件大事。在当前生产上，首先要抓包产落实，以便调动广大群众的积极性。全省春旱正在继续发展，要从现在起坚持抗旱三个半月，保证及时播种和及时栽插。为了贯彻以密植为中心的先进技术措施，现在就要做好准备和安排。还必须以积极的态度，采取切实有效的措施，进一步办好公共食堂；在工业生产和基本建设方面，要进一步深入广泛地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约群众运动，把当前工农业生产战线上的群众运动推向新的高峰。　（金雨困）
