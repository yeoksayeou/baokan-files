Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

1959 was a year of continued great leap forward for China's national economy, and railway work also made great progress. Compared with 1958, passenger traffic increased by 39%; freight volume increased by 42%; basic construction workload increased by 61%; track laying mileage increased by 32%; newly built locomotives increased by 56%; and newly built passenger and freight vehicles increased by 68%. Railway transport efficiency has also improved significantly. For example, the freight car turnaround time was shortened by 0.28 days, equivalent to saving 10,000 railcars per day. Transportation costs were reduced by 15%, and labor productivity increased by 11%. This is a victory achieved by all railway workers and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, adhering to the general line of socialist construction, opposing Right-leaning tendencies, and boosting morale to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

With the continued leap forward of the national economy, in 1960, the railway's passenger and freight volume, the number of newly built locomotives and vehicles, and the workload of basic construction will increase significantly compared with 1959. The planned freight volume is 720 million tons, an increase of 33%; the planned passenger volume is 530 million, an increase of 10%. Eight hundred new locomotives will be built, an increase of 50%; and 33,000 new passenger and freight vehicles will be built, an increase of 64%. The track laying mileage of new railways is 8,389 kilometers, an increase of 82%. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and some important trunk lines in the southwest, such as the Chengdu-Kunming, Neijiang-Kunming, Sichuan-Guizhou, Hunan-Guizhou, and Yunnan-Guizhou lines, will make great progress this year. The first electrified railway in China, the Baoji-Fengxian section, will also be fully completed and officially open to traffic. This year, the absolute increase in passenger and freight volume and the scale of road construction and vehicle manufacturing are unprecedented in recent years. This is a plan for continued leap forward. We must adhere to the implementation of the general line, work hard, and ensure the completion and over fulfillment of this plan.

The current situation is very good. Our country is full of vigorous vitality everywhere. Since the opening red at the beginning of the year, railway transport production has been rising month by month. Party committees and people's committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over railway work. The general line has taken deeper root in the hearts of the people, and the mental outlook of the vast number of railway workers has undergone profound changes. The practice of the two years of the Great Leap Forward has made our experience richer. The communist large-scale collaboration inside and outside the railway has greatly developed. All kinds of "one-dragon" transportation lines have widely appeared, and a crisscrossing collaborative transportation network is forming throughout the country. The cooperative relationship between railways and factories, railways and mines, and railways and ports has developed from the reform of the management system to the overall transformation of equipment and lines, greatly liberating productive forces. Incidental transportation will increase three or four times compared with last year. The total volume of goods transported incidentally throughout the year is expected to reach more than 65 million tons, which is more than the total railway freight volume in 1949. The railway technical innovation and technical revolution movement has set off a new upsurge since this year. This movement is surging, large-scale, and effective, and the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of heavy labor has been rapidly improved within a month or two; high, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new technologies are constantly emerging. This year, we will basically eliminate heavy manual labor in the railway sector, and labor productivity will be significantly improved. In this way, under the condition that the transport volume increases by about 40%, not only will there be no increase in personnel, but also a considerable amount of labor can be freed up to do other work. Locomotive and vehicle manufacturing and basic construction can both achieve increased production without increasing personnel, and more work can be done. The situation of continued leap forward has been fully unfolded. It is particularly important to point out that many places across the country are building small local railways, and a mass movement to vigorously develop local railways is booming. This is a major event in the history of railway development in our country. It will greatly accelerate the speed of railway construction in our country and make the railway transportation industry more adapted to the needs of the leap forward in industry and agriculture.

Now, I will specifically talk about some opinions on the issue of vigorously developing local railways.

The local railways I am talking about refer to small local railways built by local authorities. After the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, Meng County in Shanxi Province cast its own iron rails and built the first local railway. Although this railway is only 1.7 kilometers long, it is a great initiative. It has opened up a new road for high-speed construction of railways in our country. Localities have learned from Meng County's approach, boldly created, repeatedly experimented, and accumulated experience, and local railways have gradually developed. By the end of 1959, more than 400 local railways had been built and were under construction across the country, with a total length of more than 6,000 kilometers (more than 2,400 kilometers have been opened to traffic). Encouragingly, people's communes have also built railways. Last year, the Red Flag People's Commune in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, started from scratch and built a three-kilometer local railway. This shows that while the industrial and agricultural production of the people's communes is developing rapidly, they urgently need railways and are also able to build railways. Now the enthusiasm for building railways in various places is growing. According to preliminary statistics, more than 10,000 kilometers of local railways will be built this year. Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan Province has put forward a grand plan. They will vigorously build railways and manufacture railcars and locomotives this year. The first step is to achieve three connections: mines to factories, coal mines to stations, and stations to docks. And on this basis, further connect counties with counties and counties with key communes by railways, and gradually form a railway network in the entire region. This points out a far-reaching prospect for railway construction in our country. It can be envisioned that "every county has a train, and every commune has a railway" is possible in a not too long period of time, such as ten years or a little longer.

Small local railways are not only an important measure to solve short-distance transportation and internal transportation in factories and mines, but also an important aspect of implementing the "walking on two legs" policy in railway construction. It is an indispensable positive factor in China's current economic life. Therefore, the emergence of small local railways immediately aroused widespread attention from the central government and various localities, and was warmly welcomed by the masses. We railway workers are very happy to see this and must wholeheartedly support the construction of local railways.

Local railways were forced out by the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In 1958, after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, industrial and agricultural production developed rapidly, putting forward more and more demands on transportation. In particular, the coal and iron industry vigorously developed "small foreign groups," and small and medium-sized factories and mining enterprises were scattered everywhere, and transportation was very tense. Although the whole country often organized one to two million people to participate in short-distance transportation, it still could not meet the needs. Because the railways were not built, coal, ore, and wood could not be transported out of many small kilns, small mines, and forest areas, so that many useful things could not be turned into usable things; some industrial and mining enterprises could not fully utilize the capacity of production equipment because raw materials could not be transported in. How to solve this contradiction? One way is to invest more labor. It is obviously not feasible to continuously consume a large amount of strong labor on the transportation line. Even if it is possible, it cannot guarantee the needs of production. Another way is to build large railways. Although large railways have large transportation capacity and high efficiency, they require a large amount of engineering, a large amount of steel, wood, a large number of modern equipment, and more funds. In places where the transportation volume is not very large temporarily, such as an annual transportation volume of more than 100,000 tons and less than one million tons, building large railways is neither economical nor prioritized. The best way to solve the contradiction is to build small local railways that are compatible with small and medium-sized industries. This kind of railway uses less materials and is cheaper to build, only one-tenth to one-fifth of the cost of large railways. It is more efficient, lower in cost, and uses less manpower than other local transportation tools, and can also liberate the broad masses from heavy manual labor. The masses said: "Thousands of people carry and tens of thousands of people lift, happiness comes when the train runs." The local railway from Luohe to Wuyang in Henan Province is 60 kilometers long and has an annual one-way transport volume of 700,000 tons, which is equivalent to the annual transport volume of 90 cars or 3,500 double-harnessed horse carts. After the Yongchuan Coal Mine in Sichuan Province built a small local railway, the daily output of coal and coke increased dozens of times with four automobile heads pulling, and if it were transported by manpower, it would require more than 2,300 laborers. The transportation cost of small local railways is generally about four times lower than the transportation cost of automobiles and about ten to fifteen times lower than that of animal-drawn vehicles. At the same time, it is less affected by seasons and climate, can run day and night, and can ensure the normal production of local factories and mines. The reason why small local railways are so attractive is that they can adapt to local conditions, make do with what is available, use local materials, be simple and easy to implement, and be built in the shortest time to achieve the greatest results.

Is it possible to vigorously develop local railways? We believe it is very possible. Local railways were originally created by the masses. The masses have a strong desire to build roads and a communist style of daring to think and do. They said: "Fear nothing in the sky or on earth, determined to engage in train-ization." Now there are already more than 2,000 kilometers of local railway models, which have further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to build roads. Many places have been able to smelt iron themselves and have begun to master the technology of casting iron rails. With coal and iron, roads can be built. In the future, the "small foreign groups" of the coal and iron industry will have greater development, which will lay an increasingly large material foundation for the construction of local railways. At the same time, with the people's communes, manpower and materials can be arranged in a unified manner, which is more conducive to fully mobilizing the positive factors of all parties, so that millions of people can show their talents and invest in the movement to build local railways. Since vigorously developing local railways is the need for the development of industry and agriculture, and it is something that the masses want to do and can do, it will inevitably form an overwhelming trend and prevail throughout the country. As long as we seize this trend, vigorously promote it, make a big splash, create momentum, work hard, local railways will definitely be built and will definitely be built well.

Local railways, like other new things, are developed in struggle. A new thing is always imperfect, and people often have different understandings of it. This is very natural. Now, some people still have doubts about local railways. Some people believe that railway construction is technically complex, unattainable, and can only be done by the railway department, and local authorities cannot do it or do it well. This long-standing habit has a deep impact on people's minds. Many facts have proved that this idea is not realistic. Xinxiang Prefecture used the "four selfs" and "five sides" methods: smelting iron themselves without iron, finding materials themselves without materials, raising funds themselves without funds, and learning technology themselves, surveying, designing, casting rails, constructing, and using at the same time, and has built more than 200 kilometers of railways. The Red Flag People's Commune in Huaiyuan County only had one four-foot belt lathe, three pliers, and a small seat furnace, and cast its own iron rails and built a railway. They had no technology and lacked materials, and relied on their own strength to build the railway. Then, why can't other places with similar conditions build railways?

Some people also think that local railways are useless, saying that they are "cars break the rails, wasting manpower and money." It is true that things like cars breaking the rails have happened in the past, and may happen in the future. When we first started, and the technical barrier of iron rails had not yet been overcome, such things are not surprising. Everything always goes from imperfect to perfect, and broken rails, after research and improvement, can become unbroken rails. Now, after the painstaking research of the masses, the technical barrier of iron rails has been broken through. For example, Bengbu has cast heavy rails of 48 kilograms per meter, and Zibo uses heat-treated rails, which can not only run small locomotives, but also run large locomotives. Some station lines and straight lines of large railways can also use heavy rails, so that a large number of steel rails can be freed up to build more trunk lines. Xiangtan Mechanism Brick and Tile Factory recently successfully trial-produced a substitute sleeper with coal cinder. This kind of sleeper can be manufactured everywhere, and after promotion, a large amount of waste can be utilized and a large amount of wood can be saved. Some places have used cast iron to cast integral turnouts, which is also a new technology on large railways. It can be seen that as long as the wisdom of the broad masses is fully utilized, local can replace foreign and can also produce foreign. Local railways have a great future and are very useful.

Some people say: "With iron, there can be steel. It is better to use steel rails than iron rails. It is too backward to use iron rails to build railways in the 1960s." In fact, progress and backwardness are relative. Anything that can promote the development of production under the current conditions should be regarded as progress. It is a great progress from no railway to having a railway, from wheelbarrows and horse carts to small trains. Of course, steel rails are better than iron rails, and we should actively build more steel rails in places where conditions permit. However, turning iron into steel rails after all requires the processes of steelmaking, rolling, and finishing, which is not something that can be done universally in various places at present. At present, the production of steel rails in our country is not abundant, and for a considerable period of time, it is still in short supply, and far away water cannot quench near thirst. The biggest advantage of iron rails is that iron can be directly cast into iron rails, and this technology has begun to be mastered by the masses, and prefectures, counties, communes, factories and mining enterprises can all build it themselves, and it can be done by the whole people. Building more iron rails now can not only build more railways, but also play an accumulation role, and can be used to make steel and roll rails when conditions permit in the future. The current question is: Would we rather wait for the production of steel rails to be abundant before building railways on a large scale, delaying the speed of national economic construction? Or should we use both local and foreign methods, both iron rails and steel rails, and build local railways on a large scale to accelerate economic construction? If we insist on giving up iron and seeking steel, we will only miss the opportunity and reduce the speed of construction. The most important thing is to seize the time and build more railways to meet the current needs of the leap forward in industry and agriculture. With more railways, the production of coal, iron, and steel can be guaranteed; with more coal, iron, and steel, there can be more steel rails.

The above-mentioned views are fundamentally because of a lack of comprehensive understanding of the "walking on two legs" policy. In all departments and all work, we must "walk on two legs," and railway construction is no exception. Where the "walking on two legs" policy is implemented, there is vitality and prosperity. Industrial and agricultural construction "walks on two legs," and railway construction cannot adapt if it does not "walk on two legs." The development of the "small foreign groups" in industry inevitably requires the corresponding development of small local railways, so that industrial production and railway transportation maintain a roughly coordinated proportional relationship; the large-scale construction of small local railways will inevitably promote the further development of the "small foreign groups" in industry, greatly accelerating the speed of industrial development, and making the industrial layout more reasonable. Therefore, we must build railways that are both large, high, and foreign, and also build railways that are small, low, and local; we must use steel rails to build roads and also use iron rails to build roads; we must adopt high standards and also adopt medium and low standards. The two are complementary and do not contradict each other.

Building local railways is a long-term policy for railway construction in our country. Where there are large railways, there are local railways. The relationship between large railways and local railways is the relationship between trunk and branch, and the relationship between network and line. After local railways are developed on a large scale, some of them are strengthened and gradually form a local railway network; some of them increase in transport volume and gradually transition to large railways after technical transformation. It is an inevitable process of development for things to change from local to foreign, from low to high, and from small to large. The world is a unified and diverse world. Local and foreign, low and high, small and large will still exist in ten thousand years. However, their content and form will be very different from what they are now. Large railways should actively help local railways in terms of cadre training, technical guidance, and experience exchange. After local railways are built on a large scale, on the one hand, the transport volume increases, like many waters converging into a river, putting pressure on large railways, which will inevitably promote the development of large railways; on the other hand, it can also share the freight flow of large railways and reduce the pressure of long-distance transportation on large railways. Large railways and local railways support each other and promote each other, so that the mass movement to vigorously develop railways is more in-depth and broader. This jumps out of the circle of the past where railway professional teams were the main force and the masses participated in road construction, and develops into a new stage where the masses do it themselves, rely on their own efforts, and vigorously develop railways.

Of course, it is not without difficulties to vigorously develop local railways. In places where the coal and iron industry has not yet developed, the difficulties will be even greater. But difficulties require people to overcome them, and conditions can be created. The key lies in whether there is a "poor stick" spirit. With this spirit, difficulties cannot scare us. Things are done by people, and if you don't do it, no matter how good the conditions are, it is useless. Bengbu had five porters who had just shed their illiteracy, with no technology and no equipment, only two thatched sheds, an old gasoline drum, and a wooden hand-cranked blower, and they set up a rail-casting factory. At that time, some people ridiculed them, saying: "Roughnecks casting iron rails is a toad wanting to eat swan meat." They said: "What's so great about swan meat? We can eat it if the Party supports us." They dared to think and dare to do, were not afraid of difficulties, worked hard, learned while doing, and failed more than ten times before finally casting good heavy rails. It is precisely because they are poor that they are the most determined, the most courageous, and the most thorough in making revolution. Our cause is to be done with this spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, daring to create, and starting from scratch. By greatly carrying forward this spirit, we can overcome all difficulties and launch the mass movement to vigorously develop local railways.

Comrade Representatives, we deeply feel that the most fundamental guarantee for doing a good job is to seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and deeply understand Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the most comprehensive and profound development of Marxism-Leninism under new historical conditions. Studying and understanding Mao Zedong Thought is of extremely great significance for doing our work well and accelerating the completion of the socialist construction cause. In the past two years, the reason why railway work has been able to continuously leap forward is mainly because the railway cadres and workers have made progress in their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought compared with the past. The deeper the understanding, the better the work done, and the greater the achievements. Our cause is getting bigger and bigger, and our tasks are getting heavier and heavier. We must, under the leadership of the Party, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the general line, adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs," rely closely on the masses, study conscientiously and work diligently, and we will be able to continuously achieve new victories.

### 开展一个大办地方铁路的群众运动  铁道部副部长吕正操的发言

    开展一个大办地方铁路的群众运动
    铁道部副部长吕正操的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和人大常务委员会的报告。
    1959年是我国国民经济继续大跃进的一年，铁路工作也有了很大的发展。同1958年比较，客运量增长39％；货运量增长42％；基本建设工作量增加61％；铺轨里程增加32％；新造机车增加56％；新造客货车辆增加68％。铁路运输效率也有显著提高。如货车周转时间缩短了零点二八天，相当于每天节省一万个车皮。运输成本降低15％，劳动生产率提高11％。这是全国铁路职工和铁道兵指战员，在党的领导下和全国人民的支持下，坚持社会主义建设的总路线，反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动所取得的胜利。
    随着国民经济的继续跃进，1960年铁路的客货运量、新造机车车辆和基本建设工作量，将比1959年有很大的增长。货运量计划为七亿二千万吨，将增长33％；客运量计划为五亿三千万人，将增长10％。新造机车八百台，将增加50％；新造客货车三万三千辆，将增加64％。新建铁路铺轨里程为八千三百八十九公里，将增加82％。兰新线和西南的一些重要干线，如成昆、内昆、川黔、湘黔、滇黔等线的工程，今年将有很大的进展。我国第一条电气化铁路宝鸡至凤县一段，也将全部建成并正式通车。今年客货运量增长的绝对数和修路造车的规模，都是几年来从未有过的。这是一个继续跃进的计划。我们一定要坚持贯彻总路线，努力工作，保证完成和超额完成这个计划。
    现在的形势非常好。我们的国家到处是一片蓬勃生发的气象。铁路从年初开门红以来，运输生产逐月上涨。各级党委和人民委员会更加加强了对铁路工作的领导。总路线更加深入人心，广大铁路职工的精神面貌有了深刻的变化。两年大跃进的实践，我们的经验更加丰富。铁路内外的共产主义大协作有了很大的发展。各式各样的“一条龙”运输线广泛出现，一个纵横交错的协作运输网，正在全国形成。路厂、路矿、路港的协作关系，已经从管理制度的改革，发展到设备和线路的总体改造，大大解放了生产力。捎脚运输将比去年增加三、四倍。全年捎运的货物，预计可以达到六千五百多万吨，比1949年全年的铁路货运量还要多。铁路技术革新和技术革命运动，今年以来已掀起了一个声势浩大的新高潮。这个运动来势猛、规模大、收效快，在一两个月内，笨重劳动的机械化半机械化水平，迅速提高；高、精、尖、新的技术，不断涌现。今年，我们将基本消除铁路部门的笨重体力劳动，劳动生产率将有显著的提高。这样，在运量增加40％左右的情况下，不仅不增人，还可以腾出相当多的劳动力，做其他工作。机车车辆制造和基本建设方面，都可以做到增产不增人，并且可以再做更多的工作。继续跃进的形势，已经全面展开。特别要提出来的，全国许多地方都在兴办小土、小洋铁路，一个大办地方铁路的群众运动正在蓬勃地开展起来。这是我国铁路发展史上的一件大事。它将大大加快我国铁路建设的速度，使铁路运输业更加适应工农业跃进的需要。
    现在，我专门就大办地方铁路这个问题，讲一些意见。
    我讲的地方铁路是指地方自办的小土、小洋铁路。1958年工农业大跃进以后，山西省盂县自铸铁轨，办了第一条土铁路。这条铁路虽然只有一点七公里，但这是一个伟大的创举。它为高速度建设我国铁路开辟了新的道路。各地学习了盂县的办法，大胆创造，反复试验，积累了经验，地方铁路逐渐发展了起来。到1959年底，全国已经建成和正在施工的地方铁路已有四百多条，总长六千多公里（已通车的有二千四百多公里）。可喜的是，人民公社也办起了铁路。去年安徽省怀远县红旗人民公社白手起家，修建了一条三公里的土铁路。这说明，人民公社在工农业生产迅速发展的同时，迫切需要铁路，也能够办铁路。现在各地办铁路的劲头越来越大。据初步统计，今年将修建上万公里地方铁路。河南省新乡专区提出了一个宏伟的计划。他们今年要大修铁路，大造车皮和火车头。第一步做到三通：矿山通工厂、煤矿通车站、车站通码头。并在这个基础上，进一步把县与县、县与重点社用铁路联系起来，逐渐形成全区的铁路网。这为我国铁路建设指出了一个远大的前景。可以这样设想：“县县通火车，社社有铁路”，在一个不太长的时间内，例如十年或者更多一点时间，是有可能实现的。
    小土、小洋铁路不仅是解决短途运输和厂矿内部运输的一项重要措施，也是在铁路建设中贯彻执行“两条腿走路”方针的一个重要方面。它是我国当前经济生活中一个必不可少的积极因素。因此，小土、小洋铁路一出现，立即引起中央和各地的普遍重视，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。我们铁路工作者看到这件事情十分高兴，一定要满腔热情地支持地方铁路的建设。
    地方铁路是大跃进的形势逼出来的。1958年，党中央和毛主席提出了社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针以后，工农业生产飞跃发展，对交通运输提出了越来越多的要求。特别是煤铁工业大搞“小洋群”，中小型厂矿企业，星罗棋布，遍地开花，运输十分紧张。全国虽然经常组织一千几百万人参加短途运输，仍不能满足需要。许多小窑、小矿和林区因为铁路没有修通，煤、矿石、木材运不出来，使许多有用之物不能变为可用之物；有些工矿企业，因为原材料运不进去，不能充分发挥生产设备的能力。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？一个办法是投入更多的劳动力。把大量的强劳动力川流不息地消耗在运输线上，这显然是行不通的。即使可能，也不能保证生产的需要。再就是修大铁路。大铁路虽然运输能力大、效率高，但工程量大，需要大量钢材、木材、大批现代化设备和较多的资金。在运输量暂时还不太大，例如年运量在十万吨以上、百万吨以下的地方，修大铁路既不经济，也排不上队。解决矛盾的最好办法，就是修建与中小工业相适应的小土、小洋铁路。这种铁路使用材料少，造价便宜，只有大铁路的十分之一到五分之一。它比其他的地方运输工具，效率高、成本低、用人少，还能把广大的群众从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。群众说：“千人挑，万人抬，火车一通幸福来”。河南省漯河到舞阳的土铁路全长六十公里，每年单方向运量七十万吨，相当于九十辆汽车或三千五百辆双套马车一年的运量。四川省永川煤矿修了一条小洋铁路后，用四个汽车头牵引，煤焦日产量提高了几十倍，如果用人力来搬运，需占用劳动力二千三百多个。小土、小洋铁路的运输成本，在一般情况下，比汽车运输成本约低四倍，比畜力车约低十倍至十五倍。同时，它受季节、气候的影响比较少，可以昼夜行驶，能够保证地方厂矿的正常生产。小土、小洋铁路所以这样引人入胜，就是因为它能因地制宜，因陋就简，就地取材，简单易行，在最短的时间内办起来，取得最大的效果。
    大办地方铁路有没有可能呢？我们认为大有可能。地方铁路本来就是群众的创造。群众有修路的强烈愿望和敢想敢做的共产主义风格。他们说：“天不怕，地不怕，一心要搞火车化。”现在已经有了两千多公里地方铁路的榜样，更加鼓舞了群众修路的干劲。许多地方已经能够自己炼铁，并且开始掌握了铸造铁轨的技术。有煤有铁，就能修路。今后，煤铁工业的“小洋群”，还将有更大的发展，就为修建地方铁路，打下越来越大的物质基础。同时，有了人民公社，可以统一安排人力物力，更有利于充分调动各方面的积极因素，使千百万人都能大显身手，投入到建设地方铁路的运动中来。大办地方铁路既然是工农业发展的需要，又是群众要办和能够办得到的事情，就必然形成一股排山倒海之势，风行全国。只要我们抓住这个苗头，大力提倡，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大干特干，地方铁路就一定能够办起来，一定能够办得好。
    地方铁路同其他新生事物一样，是在斗争中发展起来的。一个新生事物总是不完备的，人们往往对它有不同的认识。这是很自然的。现在，还有人对地方铁路抱着怀疑的态度。有的人认为，修铁路技术复杂，高不可攀，只能由铁道部门来办，地方办不了，办不好。这种长期形成的习惯看法，在人们的头脑中影响很深。许多事实已经证明这种想法是不合实际的。新乡专区用“四自”、“五边”的办法：没有铁自己炼、没有材料自己找、没有资金自己筹、没有技术自己学，边勘测、边设计、边铸轨、边施工、边使用，已经修起了两百多公里铁路。怀远县红旗人民公社只有一台四尺皮带车床，三把老虎钳，一个小座炉，就自铸铁轨，修起了铁路。他们都是一无技术，二缺材料，靠自己的力量修起了铁路，那么，其他条件类似的地方，为什么不能修铁路呢？
    还有人认为土铁路不顶事，说它是“车过轨断，劳民伤财”。不错，车过轨断的事情过去是有过的，将来还可能有。在刚开始搞，铁轨的技术关还没有过的时候，这样的事情并不奇怪。任何事物总是从不完善到完善，断的铁轨，经过研究提高，可以成为不断的铁轨。现在，经过群众的苦心钻研，已经攻破了铁轨的技术关。如蚌埠已经铸出每米四十八公斤的重型铁轨，淄博使用经过热处理的铁轨，不但能跑小机车，也能跑大机车。有些大铁路的站线和直线，也可以采用重型铁轨，这样就可以腾出大量钢轨，来修建更多的干线。湘潭机制砖瓦厂最近用煤碴试制成功代用轨枕。这种轨枕到处可以制造，推广以后，可以大量利用废料，节省大批木材。有的地方已经用生铁铸出整体道岔，这在大铁路上，也是一个新技术。可见，只要充分发挥广大群众的智慧，土能够代洋，也能够出洋。土铁路是大有前途，顶事得很。
    有人说：“有铁就能有钢，用铁轨不如用钢轨，二十世纪六十年代还用铁轨修铁路，太落后了”。其实，进步和落后是相对的。凡是在当前的条件下，能够促进生产发展的，就应当看作是进步的。从没有铁路到有铁路，从独轮车、马车到小火车，是一个很大的进步。当然，钢轨是比铁轨好，在有条件的地方，我们应该积极多搞一些钢轨。但由铁轧成钢轨，毕竟要经过炼钢、轧制、精整的工序，这在目前还不是各地能够普遍做到的。现在我国钢轨的生产，还不充裕，在相当长的时间内，还是供不应求，远水不解近渴。而铁轨最大的好处，是可以把铁直接铸成铁轨，这个技术已经开始为群众所掌握，专区、县、公社、厂矿企业都能自办，可以全民办。现在多铸一些铁轨，不但能多修铁路，还能起积蓄作用，以后有条件的时候，就可以用来炼钢轧轨。当前的问题是：我们宁愿坐等钢轨生产充裕以后再大修铁路，推迟国民经济建设的速度呢？还是土洋并举、铁轨钢轨并举，大修地方铁路来加速经济建设呢？一定要舍铁而求钢，就只好坐失时机，降低建设速度。最重要的，是要抢时间，多修铁路来满足当前工农业跃进的需要。铁路多了，就能保证煤、铁、钢的生产；煤、铁、钢多了，就能有更多的钢轨。
    上面所说的几种看法，从根本上来说，就是因为对“两条腿走路”的方针，缺乏全面的理解。在一切部门和一切工作中，都必须用“两条腿走路”，铁路建设也不能例外。哪里贯彻执行了“两条腿走路”的方针，哪里就生气勃勃，欣欣向荣。工农业建设是“两条腿走路”，铁路建设不用“两条腿走路”是不能适应的。工业“小洋群”的发展，必然要求相应地发展小土、小洋铁路，使工业生产和铁路运输保持大体协调的比例关系；大量修建小土、小洋铁路，又必然会促进工业“小洋群”的进一步发展，使工业发展的速度大大加快，工业的布局更加合理。所以我们既要修建又大又高又洋的铁路，也要修又小又低又土的铁路；既要用钢轨修路，也要用铁轨修路；既要采用高标准，也要采用中低标准。两者互为表里，并行不悖。
    修建地方铁路是我国铁路建设的长期方针。有大铁路就有地方铁路。大铁路与地方铁路的关系，是干与支的关系，网与络的关系。地方铁路大量发展以后，一部分经过加强，逐渐构成地方铁路网；一部分在运量增加，经过技术改造后，逐渐过渡为大铁路。由土变洋，由低到高，由小到大，是事物发展的必然过程。世界是一个统一的多样化的世界。土和洋、低和高、小和大，在一万年以后还会有的。不过那时它们的内容和形式，与现在大不相同罢了。大铁路要在干部培养、技术指导、经验交流等方面，积极帮助地方铁路。大量兴办地方铁路以后，一方面运量增大，像众水汇江一样，压到大铁路上，就必然促进大铁路的发展；另一方面，又可以分担大铁路的货流，减少大铁路长途运输的压力。大铁路和地方铁路互相支持，互相促进，就使大办铁路的群众运动更加深入，更加宽广。这就跳出了过去以铁路专业队伍为主，群众参加修路的圈子，发展到群众自己动手，自力更生，大办铁路的新阶段。
    当然，大办地方铁路不是没有困难的。在煤铁工业还没有发展起来的地方，困难会更大一些。但困难要人去克服，条件是可以创造的。关键在于有没有一股“穷棒子”干劲。有了这股干劲，困难就吓不倒我们。事在人为，不去干，条件再好也没有用。蚌埠有五个刚刚摘掉文盲帽子的搬运工人，既无技术，又无设备，只有两间草棚、一个旧汽油桶、一个木制的手摇鼓风机，就办起了铸轨厂。当时有人讽刺他们说：“大老粗铸铁轨，是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。他们说：“天鹅肉有什么了不起，有党撑腰照样吃”。他们敢想敢干，不怕困难，刻苦钻研，边干边学，失败了十多次，终于铸出了好的重型铁轨。正因为他们穷，革起命来最坚决、最勇敢、最彻底。我们的事业，就是用这种不怕困难、敢于创造、白手起家的“穷棒子”精神干起来的。大大发扬这种精神，我们就能克服一切困难，把大办地方铁路的群众运动开展起来。
    各位代表，我们深深感到，做好工作的最根本保证，是认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，深刻领会毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义在新的历史条件下最全面最深刻的发展。学习与领会毛泽东思想，对做好我们的工作，加速完成社会主义建设事业，有着极其伟大的意义。两年来，铁路工作所以能够连续地跃进，主要是铁路干部和职工对毛泽东思想的领会，比过去有了进步。领会得深一些，工作就做得好一些，成就就大一些。我们的事业越来越大，我们的任务越来越重。我们一定要在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持总路线，坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，紧紧依靠群众，踏踏实实地学习，勤勤恳恳地工作，我们就能够不断取得新的胜利。
