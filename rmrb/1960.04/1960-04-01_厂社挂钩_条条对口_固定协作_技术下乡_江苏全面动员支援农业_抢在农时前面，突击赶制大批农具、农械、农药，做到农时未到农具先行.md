　　Rushing to Manufacture Large Quantities of Farm Tools, Machinery, and Pesticides Ahead of the Farming Season, Ensuring Tools are Ready Before the Season Arrives
　　(Our dispatch from Nanjing, March 31st) A magnificent and unprecedented mass movement to fully support agriculture is unfolding throughout Jiangsu Province.
　　The mass movement of cities supporting the countryside and industry supporting agriculture in Jiangsu Province has accumulated considerable experience over the past few years. This year, under the new situation, with the development of people's communes, significant developments have taken place in terms of scale, content, and form compared to previous years. Its characteristics are: from the past sporadic support, it has gradually developed into comprehensive and regular support; from the actions of a few units, it has gradually developed into a nationwide mass movement involving all walks of life; from the linking of individual units, it has developed into a vast fixed cooperation network including all industries and departments. In terms of support content, it extends from means of production to means of subsistence; from helping to develop county and commune industries, to transporting technical forces and introducing technical and management experience.
　　In order to mobilize the entire party and all people to participate in the movement to support agricultural technological transformation, all parts of the province have launched large-scale ideological education on the worker-peasant alliance since last winter and this spring. Many cities have held mass rallies of ten thousand people to support agriculture, carrying out nationwide mobilization. Various places have also widely adopted forms such as worker-peasant get-togethers, visits to the countryside, and organizing farmer delegations to report in cities, enhancing the awareness of the broad masses to support agriculture.
　　Linking industry and agriculture for cooperation is a good way to regularize the mass movement of cities supporting the countryside and industry supporting agriculture. This form has been widely developed in Jiangsu Province this year. From factory-county linking and factory-commune linking, it has developed into forms such as direct counterpart linking, workshop-commune factory linking, machine-to-machine linking, master-to-master linking, and single-item technical cooperation linking for similar types of products. Some factories and communes have also established contact systems such as regular visits, regular exchange of technical innovation experiences, and regular technical performances in communes and factories. This not only greatly enriches the content of factory-commune linking, but also enables the mass movement to support agriculture to develop more comprehensively and persistently.
　　In order to closely integrate support for agricultural technological transformation with support for current agricultural production, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee proposed as early as last early winter the requirement to "complete the task of supporting agriculture one quarter ahead of the agricultural season." Currently, various places are first launching intense shock movements centered on the manufacture of agricultural machinery and farm tools, based on the needs of spring plowing, spring planting, summer harvesting, and summer planting. By the end of February, the province had produced more than 157,000 semi-mechanized farm tools, completing 79.5% of the first quarter's plan. The production of tractor-drawn farm tools and internal combustion engines has completed 67% of the first quarter's plan, and more than 90% of the water bailers have been repaired. 19.15 million pieces of various small farm tools have been completed, reaching 75% of the needs for the first half of the year. The production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has also increased by one to three times compared to the same period last year, ensuring tools are ready before the season arrives.
　　An important aspect of urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture in Jiangsu Province is to equip county and commune industries with equipment and technology, in order to prepare material and technical conditions for agricultural technological transformation. At the same time, various localities are also making every effort to cultivate technical forces for rural areas, creating many fast, good, and economical methods, such as organizing farmers to intern in factories, organizing worker and technician roving repair teams to go to the countryside, and running short-term training courses. Suzhou and Wuxi cities recently transferred more than 800 cadres and technicians from urban factories to rural areas to serve as leading cadres in communes and commune-run factories, enriching the leading backbone of the communes and cultivating the necessary technical forces for the communes as soon as possible.
　　This mass movement to support agriculture is changing the face of cities and rural areas and promoting further links between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas. Urban factories, especially county and commune factories, are launching a vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution movement in order to better support agriculture. Large numbers of agricultural machinery and equipment, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides from cities are being sent to rural areas, greatly encouraging the revolutionary enthusiasm of commune cadres and commune members, and a trend of learning culture and industrial technology is prevalent throughout the rural and urban areas of the province.

    厂社挂钩　条条对口　固定协作　技术下乡
    江苏全面动员支援农业
    抢在农时前面，突击赶制大批农具、农械、农药，做到农时未到农具先行
    本报南京31日电　一个气势磅礴、规模空前的全面支援农业的群众运动，正在江苏省全省范围内展开。
    江苏省城市支援农村、工业支援农业的群众运动，几年来已经积累了不少经验。今年，在新的形势下，随着人民公社建设的发展，在规模、内容、形式等方面都比往年有重要的发展。其特点是：从过去带突击性的支援逐步发展为全面、经常的支援；从少数单位的行动，逐步发展为各行各业的全民性的群众运动；从个别单位的挂钩，发展成包括各行各业各部门的庞大的固定协作网。在支援内容上，也从生产资料到生活资料；从帮助发展县社工业，到输送技术力量和介绍技术经验管理经验。
    为了发动全党全民参加支援农业技术改造的运动，全省各地从去冬今春以来，都开展了大规模的工农联盟的思想教育。许多城市都召开了支援农业的万人誓师大会，进行全民动员，各地还广泛采用工农联欢、下乡访问、组织农民代表团进城作报告等等形式，提高了广大群众支援农业的自觉性。
    工业和农业挂钩协作，是把城市支援农村，工业支援农业的群众运动经常化的一种良好形式。这一形式，今年在江苏省已有广泛的发展。从厂县挂钩、厂社挂钩，已发展到条条对口挂钩、车间与社办工厂、机台与机台、老师傅与老师傅、同类型产品的单项技术协作挂钩等形式。有的厂与公社还订立了定期访问、定期交流技术革新经验、定期下社下厂进行技术表演等联系制度。这不仅大大丰富了厂社挂钩的内容，而且使支援农业的群众运动能够更全面更持久地发展。
    为了把支援农业技术改造和支援当前的农业生产紧密结合起来，江苏省委早在去年初冬就提出了“赶在农业季节前面，提前一个季度完成支援农业的任务”的要求。当前各地首先根据春耕春种和夏收夏种的需要，以农业机器、农具制造为中心，展开了紧张的突击运动。全省到2月底，已经生产半机械化农具十五万七千多部，完成了第一季度计划的79.5％，机引农具和内燃机已完成第一季度计划的67％，戽水机已修好90％以上。各种小农具已完成一千九百十五万件，达到了今年上半年需要量的75％，化肥、农药的生产也比去年同期增长了一到三倍，做到了农时未到，工具先行。
    江苏省城市支援农村，工业支援农业的一个重要内容，是从设备上、技术上武装县社工业，以便为农业技术改造准备物质技术条件。与此同时，各地在为农村培养技术力量上，也是不遗余力，创造了不少多快好省的办法，如组织农民进工厂实习，组织工人和技术人员巡回检修队下乡，开办短期训练班等。苏州、无锡两市最近已从城市工厂中抽调八百多干部和技术工人，到农村去担任公社和社办工厂的领导干部，充实了公社的领导骨干，尽快地为公社培养必需的技术力量。
    这一群众性的支援农业运动，正在改变着城市和农村的面貌，促进了工农、城乡之间的进一步联系。城市的工厂、特别是县、社工厂为了更好地支援农业，正在开展轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动。城市大批农业机器设备、化肥、农药送往农村，大大鼓舞了公社干部和社员群众的革命干劲，学习文化和学习工业技术之风盛行全省农村城镇。
