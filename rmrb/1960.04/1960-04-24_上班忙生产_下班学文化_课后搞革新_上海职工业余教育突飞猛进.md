	Working Hard at Production, Studying Culture After Work, Innovating After Class
	Shanghai's Workers' Spare-Time Education Advances by Leaps and Bounds

	(Reported by this newspaper) Under the impetus of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, spare-time education for workers in Shanghai's factories and enterprises has seen a great development, popularization, and improvement.

	In the past two months, due to the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in production has greatly increased in a short period of time, and automated and semi-automated production has emerged in large numbers. In this technical revolution, workers have increasingly felt the importance of learning cultural and technical knowledge. Female workers at the Anda Cotton Textile Factory used to think that being a spinning worker only required quick eyes, hands, and legs, but now they have seen the new electrostatic spinning machines and are actively asking to learn electricity and mechanics. Many workers, for the sake of a technical innovation or the trial production of a high-precision, cutting-edge product, forget to eat and sleep, studying technology and scientific knowledge at the same time. "Working hard at production during work hours, studying culture after work, and innovating after class" has become a new trend among Shanghai workers. Under this situation, Shanghai's spare-time education for workers has entered a stage of rapid development. At the end of 1959, the number of young and middle-aged workers enrolled in schools only accounted for 50.2% of those who should be enrolled. In the past month or so, it has risen sharply to over 75%. Illiteracy and semi-literacy among young and middle-aged workers have been basically eliminated. According to incomplete statistics from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, a total of 1,180,000 people in the city are participating in studies at various levels and types of spare-time schools. The fastest-growing among the various levels and types of spare-time schools are spare-time secondary specialized schools and spare-time universities. There are 3,290 workers' spare-time schools in the city, including 288 secondary specialized schools equivalent to high school level, and 186 spare-time universities (or college classes), representing an increase of nearly one-fold and more than one-fold respectively compared to the second half of 1959.

	The development of the technical revolution movement also requires a major reform in spare-time education for workers. The previous situation, where it took three or five years to go from primary school to secondary specialized school, and eight, ten, or even more than ten years to reach university graduation level, obviously cannot meet the requirements. Many factories have created flexible and diverse methods of running schools. These can be summarized into two categories: one is the special class for veteran workers, set up specifically to train mid-level and senior technical personnel; the other is to use spare-time schools as a base to hold a large number of short-term technical training courses and study sessions.

	Opening special classes to train veteran workers to become mid-level and senior technical personnel is an effective measure that many factories have taken this year in developing spare-time education for workers. Shanghai is an old industrial base, and skilled technicians of level four and above account for about 40% of the total number of workers. They have high political consciousness, rich production experience, a strong desire to learn, and most of them already have a cultural level of upper primary school or junior high school and above. According to the experience of some units, it is entirely possible to enable them to improve their cultural and technical theoretical level in a short period of time and become both red and expert engineering and technical cadres, provided they are given certain conditions and assistance.

	Factories use spare-time schools as a base to run a large number of short-term technical training courses and study sessions in coordination with the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The benefit of this is that it closely connects systematic spare-time cultural education and technical education with current production, advancing simultaneously, meeting both the needs of long-term, systematic learning and the needs of current production. The Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory has opened 20 special classes, such as electron microscope, optical design, and jig and fixture design, quickly helping workers become familiar with new technologies. Through such learning, workers feel that the more they learn, the more useful it is, and the more motivated they are to learn. Even during the most intense moments of the technical revolution, they do not easily stop, and the attendance rate is mostly maintained at 80% to 90% or more.

	The broad masses of workers in Shanghai regard learning as a task for building a socialist and communist motherland in the cultural revolution. The veteran workers of the Tongren Alloy Factory regard participating in learning as "joining the army" and encourage themselves to study hard with the heroic actions of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March. They spent only one month rushing through the entire junior high school algebra course. The Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory faced many difficulties in the early stages of running schools, such as a lack of teachers and classrooms. However, the workers overcame these difficulties and established primary and junior high school classes in August last year, and recently further established accelerated high school classes, and their academic performance is very good. The leaders of most factories actively rely on the broad masses to run spare-time education on a large scale, enthusiastically support workers' learning, and also participate in learning themselves.

    上班忙生产　下班学文化　课后搞革新
    上海职工业余教育突飞猛进
    本报讯　上海各工厂企业，在技术革新和技术革命运动的推动下，职工业余教育出现了大发展、大普及、大提高的局面。
    两个多月来，工业战线上由于技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃开展，生产中的机械化、半机械化程度在短时间内提高很多，自动化、半自动化生产大量涌现。工人们在这场技术革命中，越来越感到学习文化技术知识的重要。安达棉纺织厂的女工过去认为做个纺纱工人只要眼快手快腿勤就够了，现在看到了新式的静电纺纱机，主动要求学电学、力学。很多工人为了一项技术革新或试制一项高、精、尖产品，废寝忘餐地一面钻研技术，一面钻研科学技术知识。“上班搞生产，下班学文化，课后搞革新”已成为上海工人的新风尚。在这种形势下，上海职工业余教育进入了突飞猛进的阶段。1959年底，全市青壮年职工入学人数还只占到应入学的50.2％，最近一个多月来，猛烈上升到75％以上。青壮年职工中的文盲、半文盲已基本消除，据市总工会不完全统计，全市共有一百一十八万人分别参加到各级各类业余学校学习。在各级各类业余学校中发展最快的是业余中等专业学校和业余大学。全市共三千二百九十所职工业余学校，其中相当高中程度的中等专业学校达二百八十八所，业余大学（或大专班）一百八十六所，分别比1959年下半年增加将近一倍和一倍以上。
    技术革命运动的发展，也要求职工业余教育进行一个大改革。过去那种需要经过三年、五年才能从小学读到中专，需要八年、十年甚至十年以上才能达到大学毕业水平的情况，显然满足不了要求。很多工厂创造了灵活多样的办学方法。归纳起来有两类：一类是专为培养中、高级技术人材而设立的老工人特别班；另一类是以业余学校为基地，大量举办各种突击性的短期技术训练班和学习班。
    开设特别班，培养老工人成为中、高级技术人材，是今年很多工厂在发展职工业余教育中一种有效的措施。上海是个老工业基地，四级以上熟练技术工人大约占到工人总数的40％，他们政治觉悟高，生产经验丰富，有强烈的学习愿望，而且绝大部分人已具有高小、初中以上文化程度。根据一部分单位的经验，只需给予一定的条件和帮助，完全有可能使他们在短时间内提高文化技术理论水平，成为又红又专的工程技术干部。
    各厂以业余学校为基地，配合技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，大办各种短期技术训练班和学习班。它的好处是使系统的业余文化教育、技术教育和当前生产紧紧相连，同时并进，既照顾了长远、系统的学习，又满足了当前生产的需要。上海光学仪器厂开设了电子显微镜、光学设计、工夹具设计等二十个特别班，迅速帮助工人熟悉了新技术。工人们通过这样的学习，感到学习越多，用场越多，学的也越有劲，即使在技术革命最紧张的时刻，也不轻易停止，出席率大都保持在80％到90％以上。
    上海广大工人在文化革命中，把学习看做是建设社会主义、共产主义祖国的任务。铜仁合金厂的老工人们把参加学习当“参军”，并且以红军二万五千里长征的英雄行为勉励自己刻苦学习。他们只花了一个月时间就突击学完全部初中代数课。志成兴钢铁制品厂在办学初期缺教师、少教室，困难很多。可是，工人们克服了这些困难，在去年8月办起了小学、初中班，最近又进一步办了高中速成班，而且学习成绩非常好。大多数工厂的领导者，积极依靠广大群众大办业余教育，热情地支持工人学习，同时自己也参加学习。
