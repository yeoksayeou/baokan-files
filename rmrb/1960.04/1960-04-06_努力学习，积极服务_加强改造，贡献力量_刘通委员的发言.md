    In the current new stage of socialist construction, diligently studying Chairman Mao's works and arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought is an extremely important political task and the direction of our progress. For members of democratic parties who are required to actively serve and strengthen their transformation, studying Mao Zedong Thought is of even greater significance.

    I express my warm support for Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I believe that the reports of the two vice premiers reflect the ardent desire of our 600 million people to continue the Great Leap Forward, and also reflect the objective possibility of definitely continuing the Great Leap Forward.

    The earth-shaking Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 has deeply rooted the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes in the hearts of the people. The people of the whole country have unanimously and profoundly realized that these are the three magic weapons for building socialism and are products of Mao Zedong Thought. Holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and following the glorious path of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to achieve a long-term and sustained Great Leap Forward in the national economy. Judging from the situation in Fujian Province, there is also a profound understanding. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of Fujian Province have held high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and have achieved a comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Last year, our province achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts. The development speed of agriculture was unprecedented. In the face of severe wind and flood disasters, the people's communes demonstrated their power, ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. The total agricultural output value increased by 29% compared with 1958, and the grain output increased by 21.6% compared with 1958. 90% of the members of the rural people's communes increased their income. Local industries blossomed everywhere, establishing a number of modern steel, chemical, electric power, machinery, forest chemical, sugar making, and paper making industries, and began to establish a modern industrial base, changing the backward face of industry in our province. At the beginning of this year, good news kept pouring in from all parts of the province, setting off a new upsurge of an unprecedentedly large-scale spring plowing, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, land reclamation and afforestation, and technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The people of the whole province responded to the call of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to reclaim wasteland and plant trees, marching towards barren mountains, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and using large-scale operations. In just ten short days in late February, they reclaimed more than four million mu of wasteland, transforming large tracts of barren mountains into "treasure mountains" that benefit the people. At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is magnificent, and the victory horn has resounded in every corner of the province.

    Before coming to Beijing to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I went to inspect and visit some areas in northern Fujian. I saw technical innovations and technical revolutions being carried out everywhere, workers and peasants working enthusiastically, in high spirits, boldly creating innovations, and promoting the more rapid development of production and construction. In the Jianxi Hydropower Station, which is under construction with a large-scale power generation capacity, the workers made a big technical innovation and technical revolution, reducing the original need for more than 30,000 laborers to only more than 10,000 laborers. At the same time, the original plan to generate electricity in 1963 was advanced to 1962. They also proposed the heroic goal of striving to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization on "May Day" this year, and requested further improvement of labor productivity. Fujian is a mountainous area, and northern Fujian is even more mountainous. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, in the past year, many factories have been built from scratch, from small to large, in the barren mountains and ridges of northern Fujian. The local people were sincerely moved by the ever-changing face of their hometown. In order to strive for high-speed development of production, the workers used indigenous methods and combined indigenous and foreign methods to boldly create innovations, and the quality and quantity of products have been astonishingly improved. The forestry chemical plant I saw in Nanping was started by three cadres who were sent to lower levels and two loggers with a hundred yuan of funds using indigenous methods. In just over a year, it has developed into a plant with more than two hundred employees, producing four hundred sheets of fiberboard per day, and also producing tannin extract, synthetic petroleum, and pine needle aromatic oil, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. In rural areas, the promotion of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has further and better implemented the "Eight-Character Charter." Many water conservancy projects have been completed quickly and well, giving full play to the powerful power of resisting disasters and ensuring increased production. Cities across Fujian Province are also vigorously running people's communes, running street industries, and running service undertakings. Housewives have freed themselves from tedious housework and participated in street work and various collective living welfare undertakings. Many social figures have also invested in these activities. All this strongly reflects the urgent desire of the broad masses of urban and rural people to make a Great Leap Forward and to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness."

    I believe that in the current excellent situation of continuous Great Leap Forward booming across the country, the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian will inevitably further encourage the people of the whole country to realize the confidence and fighting spirit of the 1960 comprehensive and better Great Leap Forward, and further mobilize all positive factors in building socialism. In the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the encouragement and promotion of the continuous Great Leap Forward situation, our democratic party members have also made great progress in service and transformation. However, in the new situation of continuous and rapid development, we deeply feel that we must actively serve and strengthen transformation in order to keep up with the progress of the times. The process of socialist construction is the process of promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism. Socialist construction has now entered a new stage. In the gradually deepening technical innovation, technical revolution movement, and urban people's commune movement, we will inevitably fight against the bourgeois stand and viewpoint, and fight against conservative and backward ideas. The experience of decades of revolutionary history in our country proves that studying Mao Zedong Thought and following Chairman Mao is victory. In the current new stage of socialist construction, diligently studying Chairman Mao's works and arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought is an extremely important political task and the direction of our progress. For members of democratic parties who are required to actively serve and strengthen their transformation, studying Mao Zedong Thought is of even greater significance. Our democratic party members must take the Party's General Line for socialist construction as the guiding principle, carefully read Chairman Mao's works and related documents, combine visits, link with thoughts and work, and understand its spiritual essence; further understand and better implement the General Line, actively serve, actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, actively participate in the urban people's commune movement, better combine service and transformation, strengthen the transformation of political stand and at the same time transform the world view, and resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we must hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and actively contribute to realizing this year's comprehensive and better Great Leap Forward.

    努力学习，积极服务  加强改造，贡献力量
    刘通委员的发言
    在当前社会主义建设新阶段，努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，是一项极端重要的政治任务，是前进的方向。对于要求积极服务加强改造的民主党派成员，学习毛泽东思想，更具有重大的意义。
    我对李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈叔通副主席的全国政协常委会工作报告，表示热烈的拥护。我认为两位副总理的报告反映了我国六亿人民迫切要求继续跃进的愿望，同时也反映了一定能够继续跃进的客观可能性。
    1958年和1959年连续两年的翻天复地的大跃进，总路线、大跃进、人民公社已深入人心；全国人民一致深刻地认识到，这是建设社会主义的三大法宝，是毛泽东思想的产物；高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，沿着光辉的毛泽东思想的道路，我们一定能够实现国民经济长期持续的大跃进。从福建省的情况看，同样有深刻的体会。福建全省人民在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在中共福建省委的直接领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，取得了社会主义建设全面连续大跃进的胜利。去年，我省各个战线都取得辉煌的成就，农业的发展速度是空前的，在特大风水灾害的情况下，人民公社发挥了威力，保证了农业大丰收，农业总产值比1958年增长了29％，粮食产量比1958年增长了21.6％，农村人民公社90％的社员都增加了收入。地方工业遍地开花，建立了一批现代化的钢铁、化学、电力、机械、森林化工、制糖和造纸工业，开始建立现代化的工业基础，改变了我省工业落后的面貌。今年一开春，全省各地捷报频传，掀起了规模空前巨大的春耕、养猪积肥、开荒造林和技术革新、技术革命运动的新高潮。全省人民响应中共福建省委开荒造林，向荒山进军的号召，大搞群众运动，运用大兵团作战，仅仅在2月下旬短短的十天时间，就开荒四百多万亩，把大片荒山改造成为造福人民的“万宝山”。目前，技术革新、技术革命运动波澜壮阔，胜利的号角响遍了全省每一个角落。
    我在来京参加全国政协会议前夕，曾到闽北一些地区视察参观。看到处处在大闹技术革新、技术革命，工人农民干劲冲天，意气风发，大胆创造革新，促进了生产建设更加迅速地发展。正在兴建的发电能力规模宏大的建溪水电站，工人大闹技术革新、技术革命，把原来需要三万多劳动力，缩减到只要一万多个劳动力，同时原定1963年发电，提前到1962年便可发电，他们还提出争取在今年“五一”实现机械化和半机械化的豪迈目标，要求进一步提高劳动生产率。福建是一个山区，闽北更是多山，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，一年来，在闽北层峰叠嶂的荒山野岭中，从无到有，从小到大，建设起来许多工厂。当地人民对家乡的面貌日新月异地改观，衷心感奋。工人们为了争取高速度的发展生产，土法上马，土洋并举，大胆创造革新，产品的质量和数量都有惊人的提高。我在南平看到的林业化工厂，是由三个下放干部和两个伐木工人，以百元资金土法上马搞起来的，仅仅一年多的时间，就发展成拥有两百多个职工，日产纤维板四百张，同时还生产栲胶、人造石油和松针芳香油等，为国家创造了大量财富。在农村中，技术革新、技术革命运动的推动，“八字宪法”进一步地更好地贯彻。许多水利工程是又好又快地修建完成，发挥了抗灾保证增产的强大威力。福建省各地城市也正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办服务事业，家庭妇女纷纷摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，参加了街道工作和各种集体生活福利事业。许多社会人士也投入了这些活动。这一切是强烈地反映了城乡广大人民群众要求大跃进，要求迅速地改变“一穷二白”面貌的迫切愿望。
    我认为，在目前全国各地一片蓬蓬勃勃的继续跃进的大好形势中，李富春、李先念副总理的报告，必然更加鼓舞全国人民为实现1960年全面的更好的跃进的信心和斗志，进一步调动建设社会主义的一切积极因素。过去一年，我们民主党派成员在党和毛主席英明领导下，在连续大跃进形势的鼓舞和推动下，服务和改造也取得了很大的进步。但在继续不断飞跃发展的新形势下，我们深切地感到必须积极服务、加强改造，才能跟上时代前进。社会主义建设的过程，即是兴无灭资的过程，社会主义建设现在已进入了新的阶段，我们在逐步深入的技术革新、技术革命运动和城市人民公社化运动中，都必然要与资产阶级立场观点作斗争，要与保守落后思想作斗争。我国几十年革命历史的经验证明，学习毛泽东思想，跟着毛主席走就是胜利。在当前社会主义建设新阶段，努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，是一项极端重要的政治任务，是前进的方向。对于要求积极服务加强改造的民主党派成员，学习毛泽东思想，更具有重大的意义。我们民主党派成员要以党的社会主义建设总路线为纲，精读毛主席著作和有关文件，结合参观，联系思想和工作，领会其精神实质；进一步理解和更好地贯彻执行总路线，积极服务，积极投入技术革新、技术革命运动，积极投入城市人民公社化运动，把服务与改造更好地结合起来，加强政治立场改造同时改造世界观，坚决听毛主席的话，跟共产党走。我们要在党和毛主席的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，为实现今年全面的更好的跃进积极贡献力量。
