Long Live the Great Unity of the Han and Tibetan Nationalities
——After Seeing the Play "Princess Wencheng"
Wang Feng
    Comrade Tian Han's new work "Princess Wencheng" has been publicly performed by the China Youth Art Theatre. This is a good play that reflects national issues and national relations, and is a historical play depicting the friendship between the Tang and Tubo (i.e., Han and Tibetan) people. This story illustrates that as early as more than 1,300 years ago, the Han and Tibetan people already had close ties and extremely close cultural exchanges. Due to my work, I have read the script and watched the rehearsals more than once, and I felt unspeakably happy in my heart. I think the script is well written and the performance is very successful.
    The play "Princess Wencheng" can be regarded as a good work depicting the development of national relations in our country. Our country has been a multi-ethnic country since ancient times. Our territory was jointly developed by the people of all ethnic groups, and our culture was also jointly created by the people of all ethnic groups. Although there have been wars between the various ethnic groups in history, this is not the main current of history; the large and dominant aspect is still the economic, political and cultural exchanges, mutual learning, mutual influence and friendly cooperation between the various ethnic groups.
    Princess Wencheng went to Tubo in the fifteenth year of Zhenguan (641 AD). The "Reign of Zhenguan" is a famous prosperous period in Chinese history. According to historical records, Emperor Taizong of Tang was an outstanding emperor. After he ascended the throne, he quickly restored the feudal order, enabling his empire to achieve great achievements in politics, economy and culture. With the end of the long-term military conflict, the trade routes between the East and the West were smooth, and economic and cultural exchanges developed. At this time, Chang'an, the capital of the Tang Dynasty, became more and more prosperous and became the center where people of all ethnic groups yearned for, learned culture and production technology.
    At the same time, Tubo had also become strong, and Songtsen Gampo was the Zanpu of Tubo at this time. Songtsen Gampo was also a brave and resourceful Zanpu. He successively unified the various tribes, expanded the territory, and had hundreds of thousands of elite soldiers. Songtsen Gampo admired the advanced culture of the Tang Dynasty. In the eighth year of Zhenguan (634 AD), he sent envoys to Chang'an for the first time to establish friendly relations and request marriage. Subsequently, Emperor Taizong of Tang also sent envoys to return the visit, and the friendly relations between Tang and Tubo were established from then on. In the fifteenth year of Zhenguan (641 AD), according to Emperor Taizong's established policy of "marriage diplomacy", Princess Wencheng arrived in Lhasa under the escort of special envoys from the Tang Dynasty and the welcome of special envoys from Tubo.
    The people will never forget whoever does good things for them. Because of this, although it has been more than 1,300 years since Princess Wencheng entered Tubo, the praise of Princess Wencheng by the vast Tibetan masses is still widely spread today. Princess Wencheng is truly a household name and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in the Tibetan areas. The Tibetan people sing the praises of Princess Wencheng's spirit of dedicating herself to the cause of national friendship and unity; sing the praises of her bringing peace and the culture of the Central Plains at that time to the Tubo people; and sing the praises of her opening up the road to civilization for the Tubo people. As depicted in the play, Princess Wencheng entered Tubo with the grand wish of promoting the culture of the Central Plains, benefiting the Tubo people, consolidating the friendship between Tang and Tubo, protecting the western border of the Tang Dynasty, and maintaining eternal harmony. After listening to the Tubo special envoy Lun Dongzan relaying to her that the reason why Songtsen Gampo, the Zanpu of Tubo, wanted to welcome her to Tubo was "Welcoming the princess is welcoming the culture of the Central Plains," Princess Wencheng said: "How beautiful it is for a woman to be able to bring culture as her dowry to the place where she marries!" The spirit of Princess Wencheng's dedication to the cause of national friendship and unity is worthy of praise and should be praised.
    Friendship and unity and cultural exchanges between ethnic groups are of great significance to the development of each ethnic group. This is a good thing that the working people of all ethnic groups have always longed for and warmly welcomed. At that time, there were also people who opposed this good thing that was conducive to the unity and development of the Han and Tibetan nationalities. The development of history is like this, and some of the plots expressed by Comrade Tian Han in "Princess Wencheng" are also like this. In the Tang Dynasty, there were Hou Junji and others who advocated war and opposed marriage; they advocated rejecting the marriage, and if Tubo did not submit, they would "lead elite troops to conquer." However, Emperor Taizong of Tang and Wei Zheng believed that the culture of the Central Plains absorbed the wisdom of the world, just like the vast ocean gathers hundreds of rivers. The people of the Central Plains cannot monopolize it. When the princess descends to Tubo, the culture of the Central Plains will definitely integrate with the culture of Tubo, bloom with brilliant flowers, and benefit the people of the border areas. This proposition of helping the less developed Tibet with the politically, economically, and culturally developed Central Plains is completely correct. In Tubo, there were also Songtsen Gampo and Lun Dongzan who advocated Tang-Tubo friendship and learning from the culture of the Central Plains; there were also Ome Lze and Gongdun who opposed marriage and tried their best to sabotage it. The struggle between unity and hostility, progress and backwardness runs through the entire script, and finally ends with the victory of Tang-Tubo unity. The masses sing loudly:
    "Zanpu and Princess!
    May you be like branches and wings, forever,
    Protecting the western border of the motherland, with abundant harvests and healthy people,
    The vast family of nephews and uncles shines throughout the universe."
    This is a hymn of the working people, and it also expresses their great ideals.
    Due to the peace between Tang and Tubo, the economic and cultural influence of the Central Plains on Tibet was far-reaching. The Tibetan people still circulate the saying that those crops, production technologies and tools, and daily necessities were introduced to Tibet by Princess Wencheng. The borrowing of Chinese words further proves the authenticity of this legend. For example, highland barley is still called "qingke" in Tibetan, radish is called "Tang radish", willow is called "Tang willow", love and care is called "qiangbao", boat is called "zhou", hat is called "shamao", clothes are called "lanshan"... and so on; as for the names of daily necessities and vegetables, many are exactly the same as those of the Han nationality. This situation fully shows that the culture of the Central Plains has blossomed and borne fruit among the Tibetan people.
    It is very beneficial to perform this moving historical play today, when the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities is unprecedentedly consolidated and developed on a new basis. On March 10, 1959, the reactionary upper class group in Tibet shot themselves in the foot. They completely disregarded the wishes of the working people, broke their promises, colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, tore up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and launched a full-scale armed rebellion,妄想分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结. However, in no time, the shameful rebellion launched by the reactionary upper class group was quickly crushed, the old system that had been oppressing the working people for thousands of years was completely overthrown, and the millions of serfs who had been without freedom for generations also stood up. At present, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Tibetan people, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, are working with unparalleled enthusiasm to further strengthen the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, thoroughly complete the democratic revolution, and vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production. Under such a great situation, allowing people to relive the history of Han-Tibetan friendship through artistic images is not only a good artistic enjoyment, but also truly conducive to unity and unification between nationalities. Therefore, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the playwright, director, actors, and stage workers of the play "Princess Wencheng". Congratulations on the success of the performance of "Princess Wencheng". (Attached picture)

    汉藏民族团结万岁
    ——话剧“文成公主”观后
    汪锋
    田汉同志的新作“文成公主”已经由中国青年艺术剧院公演了。这是一出表现民族问题、民族关系的好戏，是一个描写唐、蕃（即汉、藏）友好的历史戏。这个故事说明，早在一千三百多年以前，汉藏两族人民就已经有了血肉相联的关系和极其密切的文化往来。由于工作的关系，我曾不止一次地读过剧本，看过排演，内心感到有说不出的高兴。我认为，剧本写得好，演出很成功。
    话剧“文成公主”可算得是描绘我国民族关系发展情况的一部好作品。我国很早就是一个多民族的国家，我国的领土是各族人民共同开拓出来的，我国的文化也是各族人民共同创造出来的。各民族之间，虽然在历史上互相间也发生过战争，但是，这不是历史的主流；大量的和主导的方面还是各民族之间在经济、政治和文化上相互交流，互相学习、互相影响和友好合作的关系。
    文成公主去吐蕃是在贞观十五年（公元六四一年）。“贞观之治”是我国历史上有名的兴盛时期。根据史书的记载，唐太宗是一位杰出的皇帝，他即位以后，很快地恢复了封建秩序，使他的帝国在政治上、经济上和文化上都获得了巨大的成就。随着长期以来的军事冲突局面的结束，东方和西方的商道畅通了，经济和文化的交流发展了，这时候，唐朝的首都长安，越发繁荣昌盛，成为当时各族人民共同向往，学习文化和生产技术的中心。
    与此同时，吐蕃也已经强大起来，松赞干布就是这时吐蕃的赞普。松赞干布也是一位有勇略的赞普，他先后统一了各部，扩大了疆土，并有胜兵数十万。松赞干布对于唐朝的先进文化是羡慕的。贞观八年（公元六三四年），他第一次派使臣到长安通好，要求结为亲戚。接着，唐太宗也派使臣回访，唐蕃之间的友好关系从此建立。到贞观十五年（公元六四一年），根据唐太宗“和亲”的既定政策，文成公主就在唐朝专使的护送和吐蕃专使的迎接下到了拉萨。
    只要谁给人民作了好事，人民是永远不会忘掉的。正因如此，文成公主进入吐蕃，虽然已经有一千三百多年了，但是，直到今天，广大的藏族群众，对于文成公主的歌颂，仍是到处流传。文成公主在藏族地区真是一个家喻户晓、深入人心的人物。藏族群众歌颂文成公主的那种献身于民族友好团结事业的精神；歌颂她给吐蕃人民带来过和平和当时中原地区的文化；歌颂她为吐蕃人民开辟过走向文明的道路。正如剧中所描写的，文成公主是抱着发扬中原文化、利乐吐蕃人民、巩固唐蕃亲好、屏藩大唐西陲、永敦睦谊的宏愿进入吐蕃的。文成公主在听了吐蕃专使大论禄东赞向她转述吐蕃赞普松赞干布要迎她入蕃的原因是“迎得了公主就是迎得了中原文化”之后，说道：“一个女子能够把文化作为妆奁带给她出嫁的地方，那是多么美的事啊！”文成公主的这种献身于民族友好团结事业的精神，是值得歌颂的，也是应当歌颂的。
    民族之间的友好团结、文化交流，对于各民族的发展都有极重要的意义，这是各民族劳动人民所终日向往和热烈欢迎的好事。在当时，这种有利于汉藏民族团结和发展的好事，也不是没有人反对的。历史的发展如此，田汉同志在“文成公主”中所表现的某些情节也是如此。在唐朝，有侯君集等主张战争、反对和亲的一派；他们主张拒绝婚事，如果吐蕃不服，就“率领劲旅，前往征剿”。但是唐太宗和魏征等却认为中原文化吸取了天下的智慧，譬如汪洋大海汇百川而成，不是中原人民所得而私。公主下降吐蕃，中原文化必定与吐蕃文化结成一体，开出灿烂花朵，利乐边地人民。这种以政治、经济、文化发达的中原帮助不太发达的西藏的主张，是完全正确的。在吐蕃，同样有主张唐蕃亲好、学习中原文化的松赞干布和禄东赞等一派；也有反对通婚、极力破坏的俄梅勒赞和恭顿等一派。团结和敌对、进步与落后的斗争，贯穿了整个的剧本，而最终以唐蕃团结的胜利场面结束。群众高唱：
    “赞普啊，公主啊！
    愿你们连枝比翼，天长地久，
    守护着祖国西陲，年丰人寿，
    泱泱甥舅大家庭，光辉照彻宇宙”。
    这是劳动人民的赞歌，也表达了他们的伟大理想。
    由于唐蕃的和好，中原的经济、文化对西藏的影响是深远的。西藏人民直到今天还流传着那些农作物、生产技术和生产工具以及日用品等是由文成公主传入西藏的说法，在借用汉语词汇上，更加证明了这种传说的真实性。像青稞麦藏语仍叫“青稞”，萝卜称“唐萝卜”，柳树称“唐柳”，爱护叫“襁褓”，船叫“舟”，帽叫“沙帽”，衣服叫“兰衫”……等等；至于日用品菜蔬等名称则有很多是同汉族的完全一样。这种情况充分说明，中原文化在藏族人民中，开了花，结了果。
    汉藏民族团结在新的基础上空前巩固和发展的今天，来演出这个动人的历史戏，是很有益的。1959年3月10日，西藏的反动上层集团搬起石头打自己的脚，他们完全无视劳动人民的意愿，背信弃义，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，撕毁和平解放西藏办法的协议，发动了全面的武装叛乱，妄想分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结。但是，曾几何时，反动上层集团所发动的可耻的叛乱被迅速地粉碎了，千百年来压在劳动人民头上的旧制度被彻底地推翻了，世世代代毫无自由的百万农奴也站起来了。目前，西藏人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，同全国各民族人民一样，正以无比的干劲，为更加加强汉藏民族团结，彻底完成民主革命，大力发展工农业生产而努力地工作着。在这样的大好形势下，使人们通过艺术的形象，重温一下汉藏友谊的历史，就不仅是一次好的艺术享受，也确实有助于民族间的团结和统一。因此，我愿意再一次地向话剧“文成公主”的剧作者、导演、演员和舞台工作者同志们表示衷心的感谢。祝贺“文成公主”演出成功。（附图片）
