Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 31st: Some Indian newspapers have warmly welcomed the border agreement signed between China and Nepal.

The Bengali-language "Liberty" stated in an editorial on the 29th that the resolution of border issues between China and Burma, as well as China and Nepal, has dealt a major blow to the activities of imperialists and other reactionaries engaged in undermining Afro-Asian solidarity and the friendly relations of Panchsheel.

The editorial said that imperialist conspiracies are using some anti-China monsters to isolate Asian countries from each other, and even attempting to isolate India by providing military guarantees "in order to drag our country into the trap of establishing a joint defense system with Pakistan." The editorial pointed out that "there is no reason to believe that this conspiracy has come to an end. In some newly independent countries, imperialists are once again striving to drag other countries into that state of isolation through this approach. Burma and Nepal have been able to avoid this danger because they have established genuinely friendly relations with China."

The editorial said, "Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government have repeatedly stated that imperialists are still sowing seeds of discord among our countries." During his visit to China, Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala, in some of his speeches, "did not forget to remind people to guard against the entirely destructive phenomenon of disunity and to guard against the danger of imperialist resurgence."

The newspaper said, "As long as people clearly recognize this point, if people are loyal to Afro-Asian solidarity and Panchsheel, then there is no irreconcilable discord among our countries."

The weekly "People's Power" said in an editorial that "the recent agreement signed between China and Nepal is a fatal blow to those imperialists who hope to isolate China among its Asian neighbors. It is also the clearest example of China's determination to resolve all its outstanding issues with other Asian countries in the most peaceful and friendly manner. This is also the best proof of the effectiveness of Panchsheel, which has often been attacked by Indian reactionary politicians encouraged by the 'Cold War' camp."

The editorial continued, China recently signed an agreement with Burma on the border issue. It has also held negotiations with Indonesia to resolve the issue of overseas Chinese, and resolved the border issue between the two countries with Nepal in a friendly and peaceful manner. Not only that, but it has also promised to provide Nepal with a large amount of economic assistance. We want to ask, are all these things, which clearly demonstrate its respect and friendship towards its neighbors, insincere acts? But some people refuse to see and acknowledge China's desire for peace. Fortunately, this group of China-haters is very small in India.

The editorial pointed out that Prime Minister Koirala's successful visit to China and the agreement he signed with the Chinese government are of extreme importance to Afro-Asian countries. Nepal is a close neighbor of China. It is more qualified to talk about China than the editorial writers in Washington. Koirala has made it clear that China needs world peace. The fact that Koirala and Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win were able to reach an agreement with the Chinese government should be firmly remembered by every Asian country, regardless of its internal political structure.

The Telugu-language "Great Andhra Newspaper" said, "If there is still anyone who believes that the Chinese are unreasonable, then we can tell him, based on the words of Koirala and General Ne Win, that he is telling a complete lie. The Sino-Nepalese border agreement is a fatal blow to the propaganda machine of anti-China elements at home and abroad."

The newspaper said, "Koirala has eloquently demonstrated China's peaceful intentions. He said that China is so focused on its own domestic construction that they hope people will not disturb it. We see today that China has done everything in its power to ensure peace in Asia. The resolution of border issues with Nepal and Burma proves this. If both sides are sincere, we hope that our own disputes with China can also be resolved in a timely manner."

The Tamil-language "Friend of the Motherland" said that Premier Zhou very much hopes that the complex issues between China and its southern neighbors can be resolved amicably. This Chinese statesman has shown extreme friendliness, understanding, and sympathy to all these countries: Burma, Indonesia, and Nepal.

The newspaper said that the upcoming meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is of extreme importance.

    印度一些报纸热烈欢迎中尼边界协定
    中国对邻国尊重友好
    帝国主义破坏亚洲团结的阴谋已受重大打击
    新华社新德里31日电　一些印度报纸热烈欢迎中国和尼泊尔签订的边界协定。
    孟加拉文“自由报”在29日发表社论说，中国和缅甸以及中国和尼泊尔之间的边界问题的解决，使得帝国主义者和其他反动派从事破坏亚非团结和潘查希拉友好关系的活动遭到重大的打击。
    社论说，帝国主义阴谋利用一些反华的怪物使亚洲国家互相孤立起来，甚至企图通过提供军事保证来孤立印度，“以便把我们的国家拖入同巴基斯坦建立共同防御体系的陷井”。社论指出，“还没有理由认为这种阴谋已经宣告结束。在某些新近获得独立的国家内，帝国主义者正在重新通过这种途径，竭力把其他国家也拖到那种孤立地位。缅甸和尼泊尔因为同中国建立了真诚友好的关系，才能够避免这种危险。”
    社论说，“周恩来总理和中国政府一再说，帝国主义者还在我们这些国家当中散播不和的种籽。”尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊在访问中国期间发表的一些演说中，“没有忘记提醒人们注意防止招致完全是毁灭性的不团结现象，并且注意防止帝国主义卷土重来的危险”。
    这家报纸说，“只要人们清楚地认识到这一点，如果人们忠于亚非团结和潘查希拉，那么在我们这些国家当中就没有什么无法解决的不和。”
    “人民力量”周刊在社论中说，“中国同尼泊尔最近签订的协定对于那些希望使中国在它亚洲邻国中陷于孤立的帝国主义来说，是个致命的打击。这也是表现中国决心以最和平和最友好的方法来解决它同其他亚洲国家之间的一切悬而未决的问题的最明显的事例。这也是潘查希拉的功效的最好的证明，受到‘冷战’阵营鼓励的印度反动政客们曾经常攻击潘查希拉。”
    社论又说，中国最近曾同缅甸就边界问题签订了协定。它还同印度尼西亚举行谈判来解决华侨问题，用友好和平的方法同尼泊尔解决了两国间的边界问题。还不仅仅是这样，它还答应在经济上给予尼泊尔大量的援助。我们要问，所有这些清楚地表现了它对邻国尊重和友好的事情难道就是不诚恳的行为吗？但是有些人拒绝看到和承认中国争取和平的愿望。所幸，这群仇恨中国的人在印度是很少的。
    社论指出，柯伊拉腊首相对中国的成功的访问以及他同中国政府所签订的协定对亚非国家来说具有极为重要的意义。尼泊尔是中国的近邻。它要比华盛顿的社论作者们更有资格谈论中国。柯伊拉腊已经清楚地表明，中国需要世界和平。柯伊拉腊和缅甸总理奈温将军能够同中国政府达成协议，这点应该被每一个亚洲国家牢牢记住，不管它的内部政治结构如何。
    泰鲁固文“大安德拉报”说，“假如还有任何人仍然认为，中国人是不讲道理的，那么以柯伊拉腊和奈温将军的谈话为证，我们可以对他说，他说的完全是谎话。中尼边界协定是对（印度）国内和国外的反华分子的宣传机器的致命打击。”
    这家报纸说，“柯伊拉腊已经雄辩地说明了中国的和平意图。他说，中国是这样专心一致地在搞他们自己的国内建设，以致他们希望人们不要去打搅他。我们今天看到，中国已经尽它自己的一切能力来保证亚洲的和平。同尼泊尔和缅甸解决边界问题就证明这一点。如果双方都抱有诚意，我们希望，我们自己同中国的纠纷也能够及时得到解决。”
    泰米尔文“祖国之友报”说，周总理非常希望中国和它南部邻国之间错综复杂的问题得到友好的解决。这位中国政治家对缅甸、印度尼西亚和尼泊尔所有这些国家表现了极端的友好、谅解和同情。
    这家报纸说，周恩来和尼赫鲁即将举行的会晤具有极为重要的意义。
