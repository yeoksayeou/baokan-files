Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 19th: The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Executive Board issued a statement today supporting the decision made by the Japan Coal Miners' Union temporary convention and stating that the Japanese Communist Party, together with the Socialist Party, will fight with all its strength to defend and support the Miike Coal Mine workers.

　　The statement, published in the "Akahata" newspaper, emphasized that the Coal Miners' Union temporary convention's decision to reject the "mediation plan" proposed by the Japanese government's Central Labor Relations Commission is of great significance. The statement said that this decision has opened up a path forward for the entire Japanese workers' movement and the future struggles of all Japanese democratic forces centered on the struggle against revising the "Security Treaty."

　　The statement pointed out that the Japanese working class and all democratic forces regard the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle as a struggle against undermining democracy and reviving militarism in the context of concluding a new "Security Treaty."

　　The statement emphasized that the Miike workers' struggle is a difficult one, but it is a struggle with a bright future and confidence in victory. If they can believe in and rely on the support of all workers and democratic forces, and further develop this strength, final victory will belong to the Miike Coal Mine workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: In order to sabotage the strike by Miike Coal Mine workers in Omuta City, Kyushu Island, against the capitalists' large-scale layoffs of workers, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government today actually dispatched approximately 2,000 police officers, and injured a large number of workers.

　　Before dawn, the police escorted approximately 150 members of the pro-government union into the Miike Coal Mine to sabotage the strike. The striking workers' picket line immediately clashed with the police. The police unreasonably arrested three picket members and injured seventy-nine workers.

　　The Miike Coal Mine workers' strike struggle against the capitalists' conspiracy to lay off 1,200 workers has persisted for nearly three months. It has become the focus of the current Japanese coal miners' struggle.

　　Today, approximately 1,000 workers held a demonstration at the Omuta City Police Station to protest the police's atrocities.

　　Leaders of the Miike Coal Mine union issued a statement saying that such acts of suppressing the workers' movement cannot be allowed and that these atrocities must be denounced to all sectors of society. They also stated that the union will deploy even stronger picket lines in the future to confront this suppression.

　　The Japan General Council of Trade Unions' defense lawyer group said that the police's actions violated the workers' legitimate rights and that the government will be questioned about this incident in the Diet.

    日共中央发表声明谴责日本政府暴行
    号召支持三池煤矿工人斗争
    岸信介竟派大批警察镇压罢工并殴伤工人七十多人
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天发表声明，支持日本煤矿工会临时大会所作出的决定，并且表示日本共产党将同社会党一起以全力为维护和支援三池煤矿工人而斗争到底。
    这项发表在“赤旗报”上的声明强调指出，煤矿工会临时大会决定拒绝接受日本政府中央劳动委员会提出的“调停方案”，是具有重大意义的。声明说，这个决定对于整个日本工人运动和以反对修改“安全条约”斗争为中心的全体日本民主力量今后的斗争，开辟了前进的大道。
    声明指出，日本工人阶级和全体民主力量把三池煤矿工人的斗争看作是在缔结新“安全条约”形势下反对破坏民主和复活军国主义的斗争。
    声明强调指出，三池工人的斗争是艰苦的斗争，但是它是有光明前途和胜利信心的斗争。如果能够相信和依靠全体工人和民主力量的支援，进一步发挥这种力量，最后的胜利是属于三池煤矿工人的。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介政府为了破坏九州岛大牟田市三池煤矿工人反对资本家大批解雇工人的罢工，今天竟然出动约二千名警察，又打伤了大批工人。
    警察在早晨天还没亮的时候，就护送着御用工会的约一百五十个会员进入三池煤矿，破坏罢工。罢工工人的纠察队当即同警察发生了冲突。警察无理逮捕了三名纠察队员，并且打伤了七十九名工人。
    三池煤矿工人反对资本家阴谋解雇一千二百名工人的罢工斗争已经坚持了将近三个月。它已成为当前日本煤矿工人斗争的焦点。
    今天，约一千名工人在大牟田市警察局举行示威，抗议警察的暴行。
    三池煤矿工会领导人发表谈话说：这种镇压工人运动的行为是不能允许的，要向各界控诉这种暴行。他并且表示，工会今后还要布置更加强大的纠察队，同这种镇压对抗。
    日本工会总评议会的辩护律师团说：警察的行为侵犯了工人的正当权利，要在国会就这个事件追问政府。
