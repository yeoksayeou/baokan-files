Comrades:
	I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule with unprecedented speed, and the 1960 plan for continued great leap forward is another inspiring and magnificent plan. While rejoicing and encouraging, I guarantee to do my job well, actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, study Chairman Mao's works hard, accelerate self-transformation, and contribute everything to the great socialist construction.
	A year ago, at the first session of this CPPCC, I reported on my preliminary experience in learning traditional Chinese medicine. Over the past year, my understanding of traditional Chinese medicine and the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine has improved. Now I would like to make a brief statement on this issue again.

	Learning Enhances Understanding, Understanding Promotes Learning
	Over the past year, through more in-depth study, including the study of traditional Chinese medicine classics and clinical practice, I have more clearly realized that traditional Chinese medicine has not only accumulated rich experience over thousands of years, but also has a complete theory summarized from long-term medical practice. This theory correctly guides the dialectical analysis, legislation, prescription and medication of traditional Chinese medicine, and in turn has been continuously developed and improved from clinical practice, forming the current complete system. Clinical traditional Chinese medicine is particularly rich and colorful, with thousands of medical books left by past medical experts. Traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a great treasure house.
	Due to the characteristics of historical conditions, the theory of traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements. This is because ancient China used this philosophical system with a simple dialectical materialism viewpoint to explain all natural phenomena, and physiological phenomena and diseases were of course no exception. Therefore, the terminology of traditional Chinese medicine theory is different from that of modern medicine. However, its essence, such as the correspondence between heaven and man (in modern terms, the unity of internal and external environment), mutual generation and restraint, and treatment based on syndrome differentiation, completely coincide with the most advanced medical ideas of modern times. These theories first appeared in an era about two thousand years ago, and can be said to be the most advanced. As for the specific application of traditional Chinese medicine, many aspects clearly show its high scientific nature (such as the combined use of various antibacterial drugs), some are relatively easy to combine with modern medicine (such as the classification of hypertension), and some cannot be combined at present. However, it is very likely to find new valuable research clues from these differences, providing an important basis for the development and enrichment of modern medicine. After more than a year of systematic study, I have gained a little insight into these main contents, laying a preliminary foundation for further study in the future. At the same time, I have a further understanding of the unparalleled correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and the necessity of absolute obedience to the Party's leadership, which greatly helps my ideological transformation. Based on these gains, my enthusiasm for learning has been continuously improved, my feelings for traditional Chinese medicine have become increasingly strong, and my confidence and determination to devote myself to the cause of traditional Chinese medicine have also been gradually strengthened. Therefore, my past year has been a process of learning to improve understanding, and understanding to promote learning. I believe that this is roughly the same as the experience of many other Western doctors who study traditional Chinese medicine.
	During the period of my study of traditional Chinese medicine for more than a year, a new situation has also emerged in the national traditional Chinese medicine work. This is specifically manifested in the unprecedented unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, the close combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in business and research work, and the upsurge of a large number of Western doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine. As of recently, there have been 37 off-the-job study classes for Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine, with more than 2,300 students, and more than 36,000 Western doctors (including some intermediate-level medical personnel) participating in on-the-job study. Western doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine has become a mass movement with great momentum. Most Western doctors have changed from more or less despising or discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine in the past to seriously and humbly learning from traditional Chinese medicine. Inheriting and developing the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine has become the strong desire of the majority of medical workers. Under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine teachers, many Western doctors have been learning and practicing at the same time, and have effectively applied the principles and specific methods of traditional Chinese medicine in their medical work, which has greatly improved the quality of medical care. The formation of this new trend, following the Party Central Committee's announcement of the instructions on organizing Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine off-the-job and the People's Daily's editorial "Seriously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," is a brilliant victory for the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine.
	From the current situation, the main problems in traditional Chinese medicine work are how to get more people to study traditional Chinese medicine, how to learn it better, and how to vigorously carry out traditional Chinese medicine research. In the above-mentioned People's Daily editorial, the Party put forward a grand call, that is, to develop my country's original school of medicine. This heroic feat is the goal of our joint efforts between Chinese and Western medicine in the future.

	Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine Should Adopt Various Methods
	There are many ways to learn traditional Chinese medicine. Off-the-job study is of course ideal and is an important way for Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine at present, but the number is obviously impossible to be too large. Mass movement-oriented on-the-job study and spare-time study can be more extensive, the content can be more flexible, and the methods can be various, including systematic study, professional study, study in work, study combined with research, and so on. Because medicine is an applied science with close links between theory and practice, the content of learning should focus on clinical practice and be constantly applied in clinical practice. Theory should of course not be neglected. The order of learning can be from theory to clinical practice, or from clinical practice to delve into theory. These are generally done well at present, and with more experience in the future, they will continue to improve. It is gratifying that through such a wide-ranging learning movement, the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine has been further strengthened. Traditional Chinese medicine teachers are enthusiastic and tirelessly imparting knowledge, fearing that they will not exhaust their strengths, and Western medical students are humbly accepting and diligently studying, and their respect for traditional Chinese medicine is also very sincere. In this way, the relationship between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine will be more normalized.
	With the development of the above-mentioned learning movement, the road to preventing and treating diseases has also become increasingly broad. The successful experience of combining traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine for difficult and complicated diseases or critically ill patients is no longer an isolated miracle. Even in general clinical work, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine complement each other's strengths and cooperate closely, which has relieved the pain of many patients, shortened the course of the disease, and saved costs. In the large-scale elimination of major diseases, the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine has also played a huge role. For example, in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, traditional Chinese medicine, according to the principle of treatment based on syndrome differentiation, uses various prescriptions and acupuncture therapy to save countless patients with advanced schistosomiasis and improve their overall condition, thereby preparing conditions for receiving effective antimony agent treatment, and these patients were previously considered difficult to cure. From these examples, we have already seen the prospect of complete integration of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and we can more deeply understand that the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine starts from the actual needs of the broad masses of people and is based on the spirit of walking on two legs and doing more, faster, better, and more economically. The combination of learning and scientific research accelerates the progress of traditional Chinese medicine research.
	Under the leadership of the Party, the research on traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine has already achieved remarkable results, and has entered a new stage since Western doctors began to study traditional Chinese medicine on a large scale. The scope of research is becoming wider and wider. Wherever there is traditional Chinese medicine business, there is traditional Chinese medicine research. The research method has changed from the past division of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. After the majority of Western doctors have correctly understood traditional Chinese medicine and initially mastered its specific methods, they are eager to apply it to solve the problems that cannot be solved in medical work at present, and combine it with their original Western medical knowledge. This has formed the inevitability of vigorously carrying out research. Many off-the-job study classes, in the spirit of the Party's education policy, have realized the principle of combining learning with scientific research, stipulating that students conduct research while interning in clinical practice. The results of these collective efforts have greatly accelerated the progress of traditional Chinese medicine research and improved the quality of research.
	The research on theoretical issues of traditional Chinese medicine that combines clinical practice and pure experimentation is also unfolding. For example, research on meridians and Qigong therapy involves the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, the Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute, through clinical observation of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapy, creatively linked the theory of traditional Chinese medicine on the pathogenesis of hypertension and initially proposed the theory of preventing and treating imbalances in the body. This work has received attention because it is a good example of combining clinical practice and combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine to study major medical theoretical issues. On a national scale, there must be many other research issues with bold ideas and bold connections that can be explored, and it is very likely that important discoveries will be made. Therefore, the road to research on traditional Chinese medicine is broad and the prospect is infinitely bright.
	From the above, it is not difficult for us to see that a surging and magnificent mass wave of researching traditional Chinese medicine is about to come or has already come. The result will inevitably be the comprehensive development and comprehensive improvement of my country's medical science, that is, the formation of a unique new school of medicine in my country called by the Party. This school will integrate the essence of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and transform it into the most advanced and complete medical science with a dialectical materialist viewpoint, which will be able to better serve the 600 million people and all mankind. This new school of medicine will be the crystallization of the joint efforts of all Chinese and Western medical personnel under the leadership of the Party. The time of its appearance will depend on the strength we invest and the speed of our leap forward. We have the correct leadership of the Party, the rich heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and the predecessors of traditional Chinese medicine who master this heritage. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, the strong medical and health team will definitely be able to quickly and collectively complete this glorious task. Let us muster greater efforts, strive to learn traditional Chinese medicine as soon as possible, learn, apply, and research at the same time, and strive to create a new school of medicine called by the Party!

    党的中医政策光芒万丈
    政协全国委员会张孝骞委员谈一年来学习中医的体会各位委员：
  我衷心拥护李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及陈叔通副主席的政协常务委员会工作报告。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国人民以史无前例的高速度，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，1960年继续大跃进的计划又是一个振奋人心的宏伟计划。在这欢欣鼓舞的同时，我保证做好现岗位工作，积极投入技术革新和技术革命运动，努力学习毛主席著作，加速自我改造，为伟大的社会主义建设而贡献出自己的一切力量。
    一年以前我在本届政协第一次会议汇报了我学习中医的初步体会。一年以来，我对祖国医学和党的中医政策的认识又有所提高，现在想对这个问题再作一简略的发言。
    学习提高了认识　认识又推动了学习
    一年以来通过比较深入的学习，包括中医经典和中医临床的学习，我更清楚地认识了，祖国医学既有几千年积累下来的丰富经验，又有从长期医疗实践总结出来的完整的理论。这个理论正确地指导了中医的辨证、立法、处方和用药，反过来又从临床实践不断地得到了发展与提高，蔚为现在的完备的体系。中医的临床，尤为丰富多彩，历代医家所贻留下来的医籍以几千计。祖国医学的确是一个伟大的宝库。
    由于历史条件的特点，祖国医学理论建立在阴阳五行学说的基础上。这是因为我国古代运用这个具有朴素的辩证唯物主义观点的哲学思想体系，解释了一切自然现象，生理现象和疾病当然也不例外。因此，中医理论在术语上是和现代医学不相同的。但它的精神实质，如天人相应（用现代名词，就是内外环境的统一）、生克制化、辨证论治等特点，完全同现代最进步的医学思想相吻合。这些学说最初出现于约两千年以前的时代，可以说是最先进的。至于祖国医学的具体应用，许多方面明显地表现出它的高度科学性（例如多种抗菌药物的合用），有的比较容易同现代医学相结合（例如高血压病的分类），有的目前还不能结合，但从这些不同之处很可能寻出新的宝贵的研究线索，为发展和丰富现代医学提供重要的依据。经过年余的系统学习，我对这些主要内容略略窥了一点门径，为今后的深入打下了一个初步的基础。同时，对于党的中医政策的无比正确性和绝对服从党的领导的必要性，有了进一步的认识，从而大有助于我的思想改造。基于这些收获，我的学习热情不断提高，对祖国医学的感情日益浓厚，献身于中医事业的信心与决心也逐步加强了。因此，我这一年来是一个学习提高认识，认识又推动学习的过程。我相信这同许多其他学习祖国医学的西医的经历是大致相同的。
    在我学习中医的一年多的时期内，全国中医工作也出现了一个新的局面。这具体表现在中西医的空前团结，中西医在业务上和研究工作上的密切结合，以及广大西医学习祖国医学的热潮。截至最近为止，全国已有三十七个西医离职学习中医班，学员达二千三百多人，有三万六千多西医（包括一部分中级医务人员）参加在职学习。西医学习中医，成了声势浩大的群众运动。大多数西医由过去或多或少地轻视或歧视中医，转变为认真地虚心地向中医学习。继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，成为广大医务工作者的强烈愿望。许多西医在中医老师的帮助下，边学习、边实践，在医疗工作中有效地运用了中医的原则和具体方法，大大提高了医疗质量。这一新的风气的形成，紧随着党中央公布关于组织西医离职学习中医的批示和人民日报发表“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论，是党的中医政策的辉煌胜利。
    从今天的形势来看，中医工作的主要问题是要更多的人来学习中医，和如何学得更好，以及大力开展中医研究工作等问题。在上述的一篇人民日报社论里，党提出了一个宏伟的号召，那就是发展我国独创性的医药学派。这个豪迈的壮举是我们中西医今后共同努力的目标。
    学习祖国医学应采取多种多样方式
    学习祖国医学，方法是多端的。离职学习当然很理想，是当前西医学习中医的一个重要方式，但人数显然不可能太多。群众运动性的在职学习和业余学习，范围可以更广泛，内容可以更灵活，方式可以多种多样，包括系统学习、专业学习、在工作中学习、结合研究学习等等。因为医学是理论密切联系实际的应用科学，学习内容应该着重临床，并且不断地在临床上应用。理论当然不应偏废，学习次序，可以由理论而引到临床，可以由临床而钻入理论。这些在目前一般都做得比较好，今后经验更多，还会不断改进。可喜的是，通过这样一个广泛的学习运动，中西医的团结有了进一步的加强。中医老师们都热情洋溢，孜孜不倦地传授，唯恐不尽其所长，西医学员们虚心接受，勤恳钻研，对中医的尊敬也十分诚挚。这样，中西医的关系就更加正常化了。
    随着上述学习运动的开展，防治疾病的道路也日益广阔。中西医结合的措施用于疑难病症或危重患者的成功的经验，已经不是个别的奇迹了。即使一般的临床工作，中西医相互取长补短，密切合作，也为很多的病人解除了痛苦，缩短了病程，节省了费用。在大规模消灭主要疾病的工作中，中西医结合同样发挥了巨大的作用。例如血吸虫病的防治，中医根据辨证论治的原则，应用各种方药及针灸疗法，挽救了无数晚期血吸虫病患者，改善了他们的全身情况，从而为接受特效的锑剂治疗准备条件，而这类患者过去一向认为是难以治愈的。从这些事例，我们已经看到了中西医彻底结合的前景，可以更深刻地体会，党的中医政策是从广大群众的实际需要出发，是基于两条腿走路和多快好省的精神的。学习和科学研究相结合加速了中医研究的进度
    在党的领导下，中医中药的研究原已取得了显著的成绩，自从西医大规模学习中医以来也走入了一个新的阶段。研究的范围越来越广泛，哪里有中医业务，那里就有中医研究。研究的方式，由过去的中西医划分，转到了中西医结合。广大西医们在正确认识了祖国医学，初步掌握了它的具体方法以后，都渴望加以应用，用来解决医疗工作中目前还不能解决的问题，并且同他们原有的西医知识相结合。这就形成了大力开展研究的必然性。许多离职学习班秉着党的教育方针的精神，实现了学习与科研相结合的原则，规定学员在临床实习中同时进行研究。这些集体努力的结果，大大加速了中医研究的进度，提高了研究的质量。
    结合临床的和纯实验性的中医理论问题的研究也正在展开。例如有关经络和气功疗法的研究，都涉及祖国医学的基本理论。最近上海市高血压研究所通过中西医综合疗法的临床观察，创造性地联系了中医关于高血压病的发病机制的理论，初步提出了防治机体不平衡的学说。这项工作受到了重视，因为是一个结合临床、结合中西医来研究重大医学理论问题的良好范例。在全国范围内，其他大胆设想、大胆联系的研究问题一定还很多，都可以进行探索，其中很可能得出重要的发现。因此，研究祖国医学的道路是广阔的，前景是无限光明的。
    由上所述，我们不难看出，一个声势澎湃、波澜壮阔的群众性的研究祖国医学的浪潮，即将到来或业已到来，其结果必然是我国医学科学的全面发展、全面提高，也就是党号召的我国独特的新医药学派的形成。这个学派将融会中西医学的精华，把它衍化成为最先进的最完整的具有辩证唯物主义观点的医学科学，将能更好地为六亿多人民和全人类服务。这个新医药学派将是在党的领导下全体中西医务人员共同努力的结晶，它出现的迟早将决定于我们投入的力量和我们跃进的速度。我们有党的正确的领导，丰富的祖国医学遗产和掌握这份遗产的中医前辈，在毛泽东思想和中医政策的光辉照耀下，强大的医药卫生队伍一定能够很快地集体完成这个光荣的任务。让我们鼓足更大的干劲，争取尽早学好中医，边学习、边应用、边研究，为创建党号召的新医药学派而努力奋斗！
