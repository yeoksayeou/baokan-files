Scientific and Technological Work Must Be Closely Integrated with Production
Speech by Committee Member Shui Xiheng

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the work report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the Standing Committee, the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on behalf of the State Council, and the report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council.

In 1958 and 1959, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the Party's General Line, great leaps forward were launched in national industry, agriculture, and all economic production and construction, as well as in science, culture, and education, achieving great victories. The main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for national economic construction were completed in two years. Following this, in the even greater leap forward of 1960, a new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution has unfolded, forming a nationwide, conscious revolutionary movement, embodying the great desire of the 650 million people of the country to shake off poverty and backwardness. This is incredibly exciting and inspiring.

Recalling that after the Party's General Line for building socialism and the Great Leap Forward policy were put forward in 1958, many intellectuals in our scientific, cultural, and educational circles felt that industrial and agricultural production could leap forward, but the reform of science and technology could only proceed according to conventional methods, merely a matter of working harder and putting in extra hours, without considering that mass movements and walking on two legs and other series of policies, are also applicable to the cause of technical reform. The facts of the past two years have proven that the Party's policies for scientific and technological reform are completely correct. Many of the aforementioned intellectuals have gradually recognized their past mistakes, changed their past passive attitude towards technical reform, and established a proactive and positive attitude. I will only make a brief speech based on my own work experience, visits, and meetings, and I welcome your corrections.

I. At the Southwest Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute's experience exchange meeting on rapid and high-quality design, more than a dozen technical demonstrations were given. These included rapid design demonstrations of water pump equipment, purification equipment, water supply pipelines, drainage pipelines, and masonry retaining wall structures, as well as rapid calculation demonstrations of standard measurement areas, steel bar areas, and output value. Based on the five-ization principles (calculation through charts and tables, drafting through assembly, data through handbooks, design through standardization, tools through mechanization), a series of measures such as improved drawing tools, dedicated sliding calipers, standard charts and tables, movable type assembly, filling-in drafting, symbol annotation, and two-layer base maps were adopted. As a result of the demonstrations, efficiency was increased from 2.5 times to 240 times. I heard that previous demonstrations had reached 1,000 times. Moreover, the quality was also good, and the opportunities for errors in calculation were reduced. In design, the standardization of equipment and structures was improved, thereby helping to simplify procedures and save time in construction. Rapid and high-quality design not only simplifies and saves mechanical action procedures, but also has some significance in saving thinking and brainpower. This movement unfolded in the Southwest Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, and some achievements were made in just three months, which also shows that under the leadership of the Party, the strength and wisdom of the masses are great.

This movement, combined with the improvement of other conditions (such as team, technology, and data), greatly shortened the design cycle. For example, the Southwest Industrial Design Institute completed the engineering design of a giant water intake pump house with a daily water volume of 400,000 tons for a factory in Chongqing, subject to an external water pressure of 40 meters deep and requiring an internal diameter of 27 meters, within ten days. The Southwest Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute can complete construction drawings for general large and complex water plants in just one month, and small ones can be completed in a few days, which has reversed the past phenomenon of design not keeping up with construction, thus delaying the entire construction.

II. Over the past two years, technical cooperation has been launched between specialized schools, research institutions, design institutions, and factories and mines in the Southwest, and preliminary results have been achieved. Chongqing University, due to frequent cooperation with some electromechanical manufacturing factories, has combined theory and practice well. This time, the five-ization movement (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and linkage) was completed very well within the school and helped various factories. Teachers and students of scientific research institutions and universities in Chongqing organized many groups to help workers and technicians in various factories and mines to summarize technical operations. To date, more than 10,000 items have been summarized and finalized for the four-izations. After helping the factories and mines to summarize and conduct theoretical appraisals, they have improved the theoretical level of technology in the factories and mines, and they themselves have also mastered relevant practical experience.

III. Through the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" mass movement, we have also completed some arduous technical reforms. For example, in this year's four-ization movement of a newly built large water plant in Chongqing, the various complex technical problems of mechanization and remote control of various operations from water intake, water purification to water supply, have been mostly resolved after more than two months of efforts under the leadership of the Party committee, giving full play to the strength and wisdom of the masses. For example, the planning and construction of the complex and extensive graded and zoned water supply pipeline network system in Chongqing's urban area, with a height difference of more than 200 meters, has finally been solved by the masses after years of efforts under the leadership of the Party committee. There are even more examples of using various measures to tap potential to support industrial and people's domestic water use during times of water shortage. All this shows the great role of mass strength and wisdom in technical reform.

IV. In implementing the Party's policy of walking on two legs, adapting to local conditions, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, Guiyang and Chengdu adopted brick construction, and Chongqing adopted strip stone structures to replace concrete for purification tanks and clear water tanks, including their arched pool covers, without reducing the quality of the project. For example, in the work of surveying construction sites, because the drilling team was busy, we only used ordinary topographic surveying instruments to determine the geological structure of the site based on the stratum structure at the steep slope and the direction of the texture on the plane, saving three-quarters of manpower and time. As for the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods in the substitution of materials and in construction and production operations, there are even more examples.

There are many brilliant and great achievements in this technical revolution movement. The above are only some minor examples that I have personally encountered to reflect the correctness of the Party's scientific and technological reform policy and some of our past erroneous understanding. Finally, I have the following points of understanding about technical innovation and technical revolution:

1. Like doing all work well, closely accepting the specific leadership of Party committees at all levels is the guarantee for doing a good job in technical reform. Not only because the Party and Chairman Mao have formulated and mastered the completely correct policies and guidelines by combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China, but also because of the arduous and complex specific events involved, all of which require the Party committee to specifically grasp them in order to be successful. For example, none of the small examples above was accomplished without the direct leadership of the Party committee.

2. Like participating in all work, putting politics in command and transforming one's ideology and position is the first condition for participating in the technical revolution movement. Not only can the Party's policies and guidelines not be formulated by anyone who is not a dialectical materialist, but also its far-reaching significance and methods of implementation are not easy to fully understand. Therefore, those who have a good ideological position can do a better job in technical reform under the leadership of the Party and contribute more.

3. Science and technology in socialist countries serve socialist production and construction. The reform of science and technology is to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Its scope is very broad, covering all production departments, from direct production to indirect production, from theory to practice, from cutting-edge to basic, from foreign methods to indigenous methods. We must look at science and technology comprehensively. Any science and technology that is not related to socialist production, theoretical separation from practice, or isolated treatment of a technical department is inappropriate. Conversely, as long as we break superstition, broaden our horizons, and look at problems comprehensively, there are many opportunities for technical reform at any time and anywhere, whether in research, education, construction, or production, whether in the superstructure or the economic base.

Furthermore, because the existence and activities of science and technology are so universal in all aspects of human life, technical innovation and technical revolution must be carried out with emphasis and planning in all aspects of human life. Not only should it be launched to factories and mines, research and educational institutions, but also throughout the country and in everyone's life, becoming a nationwide technical revolution movement, like all movements. This movement, which is in line with the desire of 650 million people to improve production, will surely quickly transform into an incomparably powerful force, thus being able to quickly achieve results. At the same time, only the technology developed in this way is most suitable for the requirements of serving socialist construction.

4. Facts have proven that technical reform can leap forward. Looking at the domestic situation, the leadership of the Party, the socialist system, and the unprecedentedly high political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people are guarantees for technical reform. At the same time, the international situation also requires China's production and construction, and therefore technical reform must progress rapidly in a leap forward manner. Through this technical revolution movement, we will see that China's science and technology will leap forward more rapidly and comprehensively than in the past, basically reaching the world's peak in a not-too-long period of time, and assuming the great task of national socialist construction. We intellectuals in the scientific and technological community must strengthen the transformation of our ideology and world outlook, and together with the working people of the country, under the leadership of the Party, contribute our greatest strength and strive for this technical innovation and technical revolution.

### 科学技术工作要紧密地同生产相结合  税西恒委员的发言

    科学技术工作要紧密地同生产相结合
    税西恒委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在会上听了陈叔通副主席代表常务委员会作的工作报告，李富春副总理代表国务院作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理代表国务院作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，我完全拥护。
    1958年和1959年两年在党和毛主席的领导和党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国工农业和一切经济生产建设与科学文教事业都展开了翻天复地的大跃进，取得了伟大的胜利，两年完成了国家经济建设第二个五年计划的主要指标。接着在1960年的更大跃进中技术革新技术革命更展开了新的高潮，形成了一个全民性的自觉的革命运动，体现了全国六亿五千万人民摆脱一穷二白的伟大愿望，令人无比的兴奋和鼓舞。
    回忆在1958年党的建设社会主义的总路线和大跃进的方针提出后，我们很多科学文教界的知识分子总觉得工农业生产可以跃进，科学技术的改革只能按常规进展，不过是加班加点苦干的问题，毫不考虑到群众运动和两条腿走路等一系列的方针，也适用于技术改革事业。两年来的事实证明，党的科学技术改革的方针政策是完全正确的。有不少的上述的知识分子逐渐认清了过去的错误，改变了过去对技术改革的被动的态度而建立了主动积极的态度。我仅就自己岗位工作，参观和开会接触的点滴经验作一简单发言，谨请指正。
    一、在西南给排水设计院的快速优质设计经验交流会上，作了十几项技术表演。其中有水泵设备，净化设备，给水管道，排水管道和砖石挡土墙结构的快速设计表演，有标准测量面积，钢筋面积和产值等快速计算表演。根据五化原则（计算图表化，制图装配化，资料手册化，设计标准化，工具机械化）采用了改良绘图工具，推算专用卡尺，标准图表，活版装配，填充制图，符号注字和二底图等一系列的措施。表演结果，提高了功效从二点五倍到二百四十倍，闻以前表演有达到一千倍的。而且质量也好，还在计算方面减少了错误的机会，在设计方面提高了器材和结构的标准化，从而对建设施工的简化手续和节约时间上有了帮助。快速优质设计不只是简化和节约了机械式的动作手续，同时已有若干节约思维考虑的脑力的意义。这一运动在西南给排水设计院展开，才三个月就有了一些成就，也说明在党的领导下群众的力量和智慧是伟大的。
    这一运动结合其它条件的提高（如队伍、技术和资料等）就大大地缩短了设计周期。如西南工业设计院在十天内完成了重庆一个工厂的四十万吨一日的水量，受四十米深的外面水压力和需要二十七米内径的巨型取水泵房的工程设计。西南给排水设计院对一般大型复杂的水厂的施工图只要一个月，小型的几天就可以完成，这就扭转了过去设计赶不上施工，因而拖延整个建设的现象。
    二、两年来西南各专门学校，研究机构，设计机构和厂矿间展开了技术协作，取得了初步的成果。重庆大学由于经常和一些机电制造工厂合作，对理论和实践结合得好，这次五化运动（机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化，联动化）在校内完成得很好，并帮助了各工厂。重庆的科研机构和大专学校师生组织成很多小组分头帮助各厂矿的工人和技术人员进行技术操作总结，迄今对四化总结定型的已有一万多项。它们经过帮助各厂矿总结和理论鉴定，使厂矿提高了技术的理论水平，自己也掌握了有关的实践经验。
    三、通过两参一改三结合群众运动，我们也完成了一些艰巨的技术改革。如今年对重庆市一个新建较大的水厂的四化运动中，从取水、净水至给水的各种操作的机械化和遥远控制化的各种复杂的技术问题，经过两个多月时间在党委领导下发挥了群众力量和智慧，都大部分得到了解决。又如重庆市区二百米以上的高差起伏，复杂广大的分级分区的供水管网系统的规划建设，群众在党委领导下几年努力终于解决了。至于在供水紧张时用种种措施发掘潜力支援工业和劳动人民生活用水的事例更多。这一切都说明群众力量和智慧对技术改革的伟大作用。
    四、在贯彻党的两条腿走路，因地制宜土洋并举的方针下，贵阳和成都采用了砖砌，重庆采用了条石结构代替?完成了净化池和清水池连同它的拱卷池盖，而且不降低工程质量。又如在勘探建筑基地工作上，由于钻探队任务忙，我们仅用普通地形测量仪器，根据地层结构在陡坡的路头和在平面的纹路走向定出基地的地质构造，对人力和时间都节约了四分之三。至于在器材的代用品，在施工和生产的操作上土洋并举的方法就更多了。
    在这一技术革命运动中辉煌伟大的成就是很多的。以上仅是个人接触所及一些较微小的事例，以体现党的科技改革方针的正确，和我们过去一些认识的错误。最后个人对技术革新技术革命有以下几点体会：
    1、和做好一切工作一样，密切接受各级党委的具体领导是做好技术改革的保证。不但由于党和毛主席运用马列主义普遍真理和中国具体实践相结合，制订和掌握的政策方针的完全正确，还由于所关联的艰巨复杂的具体事件，在在都需要党委具体的抓才办得到。如上面这些小小事例就没有一件不是在党委直接领导下办成的。
    2、和参加一切工作一样，政治挂帅，改造思想立场，是参加技术革命运动的第一个条件。不惟党的政策方针凡非辩证唯物主义者不能制定，就是它的深远的意义和贯彻的方法也不容易完全了解的。所以思想立场改得好的，在党的领导下就能将技术改革工作做得更好，能贡献出更大的力量。
    3、社会主义国家的科学技术是为社会主义生产建设服务的。科技的改革是为了要多快好省建设社会主义。它的范围是很广大的，它遍及各个生产部门，从直接生产到间接生产，从理论到实践，从尖端到基础，从洋法到土法。要全面地看待科学技术，任何不联系社会主义生产的科技，理论脱离实践或孤立地对待一个技术部门的看法都是不恰当的。反之只要破除迷信，放大眼光，全面地看问题，就随时随地，不问在研究，在教育，在建设和生产，不问是在上层建筑或经济基础岗位上都有很多的技术改革的机会的。
    更由于科学技术的存在和活动是这样普遍到人类生活的各个方面，所以技术革新技术革命也要从人类生活各个方面有重点有计划地进行。不但要向厂矿、研究和教育机构展开，而且要遍及全国到每一个人的生活中，同一切运动一样，成为一个全民性的技术革命运动。这样适合六亿五千万人民搞好生产的愿望的运动必定会迅速地化为无比强大的力量，因而能迅速收效。同时也只有这样发展起来的技术才最适合于为社会主义建设服务的要求。
    4、事实证明，技术改革可以跃进。就国内形势看，党的领导，社会主义的制度和广大人民空前高涨的政治觉悟和劳动热情都是技术改革的保证。同时国际形势也要求我国的生产建设，因而技术改革必须用跃进的方式迅速进展。经过这一技术革命运动我们将看到我国科学技术要比过去更迅速更全面地跃进，在不太长的时间内基本上登上世界高峰，负起国家社会主义建设的伟大任务。我们科技界知识分子要加强思想和世界观的改造，和全国劳动人民一起，在党的领导下，贡献个人最大力量，为这一技术革新、技术革命而奋斗。
