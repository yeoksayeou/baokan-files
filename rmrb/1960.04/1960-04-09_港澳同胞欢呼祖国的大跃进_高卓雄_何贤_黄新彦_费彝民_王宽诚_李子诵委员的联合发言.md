We wholeheartedly endorse the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and fully agree with the report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. The reports of the two Vice Premiers Li summarized the continued Great Leap Forward in our country's national economy last year and pointed out the direction for continuing the Great Leap Forward in the future. This is like a magnificent picture unfolding before people's eyes.

We come from Hong Kong and Macao, and naturally feel particularly proud of the motherland's brilliant achievements. We only feel ashamed that our contribution to the motherland's socialist construction is too little, and even our visits and studies seem insufficient. However, just from visiting a few places before the meeting, we have already seen the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune shining brightly. After listening to the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li, we have a deeper understanding that the above three magic weapons are indeed important guarantees for building a strong socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, and modern culture and science.

In 1959, our country continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The total output value of industry and agriculture in 1959 increased by 31.1% compared with 1958. The increase in the output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton was particularly significant. This powerfully demonstrates that our country's national economy has continued to develop at a high speed. The places we have visited show that various construction projects are blooming everywhere, as brilliant as brocade.

We visited Foshan, Guangdong, a national health red banner city. This ancient town, famous for its handicrafts for thousands of years, was in decline before liberation, but now it is industrially developed and has a new look. All residents of the city have developed clean habits, and even the narrow streets and alleys are very clean. Barren land has been turned into gardens, and barren hills have been excavated into lakes, making the city clean, tidy, and beautiful. Shiwan, the ceramic capital near Foshan, has also gradually changed from old handicraft pottery to semi-mechanized and automated production. The ceramic capital produces both works of art and industrial products, and some ceramic products can be used to replace steel equipment. It can both imitate the ancient and benefit the present. This was unimaginable in the past.

We visited Huizhou County and Shitang Commune in Zengcheng, Guangdong. Guangdong suffered a rare major flood last year, the worst in a century. The counties along the Dongjiang River were severely affected, and many farmlands and houses were destroyed. Huizhou and Zengcheng were both heavily affected areas, but in just a few months, people have rebuilt their homes. We saw people living in new houses. Due to the bumper harvest of the late rice crop, it has compensated for and exceeded the early rice harvest taken away by the flood. Huizhou and Shitang have "turned a disaster year into a bumper year," and "new villages are seen where disaster traces are not!" This was also unimaginable in the past.

We visited Tianjin. In a district of Zhengzhuangzi, we saw residents organized to engage in the national economy and people's livelihood, and to run resident service work. Zhengzhuangzi has both a staple food processing factory and various service shops. In one street, laundry, sewing, hairdressing, repair of utensils, and even service work related to birth, old age, illness, and death are all available. At Tanggu New Port, we also saw the port expanding year by year and equipment greatly increasing. Dock transportation has changed from heavy manual labor to mechanization. The newly built Haihe Sluice separates salt water from fresh water, benefiting farmland with irrigation. This is even more unimaginable in the past.

From this, it can be seen that things that were unimaginable in the past can be thought of, done, and done more, done well, done quickly, and done economically today. Why is this possible? This is because of the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: The continued Great Leap Forward in our national economy is a great victory for the Chinese people and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.

What our motherland does is to benefit the people and promote peace. The increasing prosperity and strength of our motherland will not threaten or invade others, but will only be conducive to maintaining lasting world peace. Our country's national budget for 1960 allocates only 8.3% of the total budget expenditure for national defense, while expenditure for economic and cultural construction accounts for 73.6% of the total budget expenditure. This fully proves that our motherland is a peace-loving country.

We deeply feel that the motherland is a peaceful giant and a loving mother. The motherland is extremely concerned about the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao. She continuously supplies the daily necessities needed by Hong Kong and Macao compatriots without any shortage. Whenever Hong Kong encounters water or fire disasters, she donates rice and grain to help disaster victims. The Hong Kong and Macao regions are located by the sea, and drinking water depends on rainfall, so droughts often cause water shortages. The people of the motherland are also closely concerned about the drinking water problem of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao. The drinking water for Macao is now fully supplied by the freshwater transported from the newly built Yinkeng and Zhuxiandong reservoirs in Zhongshan County. The water shortage problem in Hong Kong, which is the most serious and has been unresolved for a long time, affecting the lives of millions of residents, may now be resolved due to the imminent completion of the Shenzhen Reservoir in Baoan County. After the Shenzhen Reservoir is completed, it can provide flood control, irrigation, and power generation, and can also supply drinking water to more than three million people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Its main dam was built in just a hundred days. All of this makes Hong Kong and Macao compatriots feel excited and express their gratitude to the motherland.

In Hong Kong and Macao, we also often hear remarks that are hostile to and slander our country. They spread many rumors and all kinds of slanders against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. But facts are always facts, and rumors are always rumors, and they can never shake the belief of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao in the great construction of the motherland. Through the continuous flow of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots returning to visit, everyone can better recognize the facts and distinguish right from wrong. We firmly believe that our motherland will definitely continue to make a Great Leap Forward.

We cheer for the continuous Great Leap Forward of the motherland! We cheer for the motherland moving from victory to greater victory!

    港澳同胞欢呼祖国的大跃进
    高卓雄　何贤　黄新彦  费彝民　王宽诚　李子诵委员的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护两位李副总理的报告，完全同意陈叔通副主席的报告。两位李副总理的报告，总结了我国去年国民经济继续大跃进，并指出了今后继续大跃进的方向。这就像一幅壮丽的画图展现于人们眼前。
    我们来自港澳地区，对于祖国这样辉煌成就，很自然地感到特别骄傲。只觉得惭愧的，是我们对祖国社会主义建设的贡献，实在太少，即参观、学习，也显得不够。但是，仅仅从开会之前参观几个地方，就已看到总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗在闪耀光辉。而听了两位李副总理报告之后，更深深体会到上述三大法宝，确是建成现代工农业和现代文化科学的社会主义强国的重要保证。
    1959年我国继续实现了国民经济大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。1959年的工农业总产值已比1958年增长31.1％。其中钢、煤、粮、棉增产的数字，尤为巨大。这就有力地说明了我国的国民经济，继续有了高速度的发展。而我们参观过的地方，又显出各项建设遍地开花，灿烂如锦。
    我们参观过全国卫生红旗城市——广东佛山。这个以手工艺著名的千年古老城镇，解放前已衰落不堪，而现在是工业发达，面貌一新。全市居民都已养成清洁习惯，即横街曲巷，也是干净得很。烂地变成花园，荒丘开凿湖泊；把市容打扮得整洁美丽了。佛山附近的陶都石湾，也从古旧的手工制陶，逐渐改为半机械化和自动化。陶都既生产美术品，又生产工业用品，且有若干陶制品，可用以代替钢制器材。既可以仿古，又可以利今。这是过去无法想像的。
    我们参观过广东惠阳县城和增城石滩公社。广东去年曾发生百年仅见的特大洪水，东江各县受灾特重，农田、房舍被冲毁的很多。惠阳和增城都是重灾区，但为时不过几个月，人们已重建家园了。我们看见人们住的是新房子。而由于晚造特大丰收，已使给水灾夺去了的早造收成，获得补偿而有余。惠阳、石滩，是“变灾年为丰年”了，是“灾痕不见见新村”了！这也是过去无法想像的。
    我们参观过天津市。在郑庄子的一个区内，我们看见居民组织起来，大搞国民经济生活，大办居民服务工作。郑庄子既办有主食加工厂，又设有各种服务性的店铺。在一条街中，洗衣、缝补、理发、修理用具，以至有关生老病死的服务工作，无不式式俱备。在塘沽新港，我们也看到港口的逐年扩展，设备大增。码头运输，已从笨重的人力，改为机械化。而新建的海河水闸，把咸水与淡水分开，使农田获得灌溉之利。这更是过去无法想像的。
    由此可见，过去无法想像的事，今天都可以想得到，做得到，而且做得多，做得好，做得快，做得省。为什么能这样？这是因为有共产党和毛主席的英明领导，有总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝。这正如李富春副总理说：我们国民经济的继续大跃进，这是我国人民伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
  我们祖国所做的事，都是造福人群，有利和平的事。我们祖国的日益富强，不会威胁和侵犯别人，只会对维护世界持久和平有利。我国1960年的国家预算，国防费只占预算支出总数的8.3％，而经济建设和文化建设费则占预算支出总数的73.6％。这就充分证明我们祖国是个爱好和平的国家。
    我们深切感到，祖国是个和平的巨人，又是个慈爱的母亲。祖国对港澳同胞，关怀无微不至。港澳同胞所需的民生日用品，她都不断供应，无使有缺。香港每遇水、火之灾，她又送赠米粮，救助灾胞。而港澳地区，濒处海滨，食水须赖天雨，故稍遇天旱，辙闹水荒。祖国人民对港澳同胞的食水问题，也是亲切关注。澳门方面的食水，现在已由中山县新建的银坑、竹仙洞两个水库的输送淡水而得到充分供应。香港方面水荒问题，最为严重，长期以来无法解决，影响数百万居民的生活，现在也因宝安县深圳水库的快要建成而可能得到解决。深圳水库建成之后，可以防洪、灌溉、发电，还可以供应港九三百万人以上的食水。它的主要堤坝，不过百日，即告筑成。所有这些，都叫港澳同胞感到兴奋，并对祖国表示感激之情。
    我们在港澳地区，也常常听到敌视我国、诽谤我国的言论，它们对总路线、大跃进、人民公社诸多造谣、百般污蔑。但是事实总归是事实，谣言总归是谣言，决不能动摇港澳爱国同胞对祖国伟大建设的信念。通过港澳同胞源源不绝的回来参观，大家就更能认清事实，辨明是非了。我们坚决相信，我们祖国一定能够继续大跃进。
    我们欢呼祖国持续不断的大跃进！欢呼祖国从胜利走向更大的胜利！
