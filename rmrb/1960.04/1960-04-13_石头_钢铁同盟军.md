　　Stone—Ally of Steel Lu Ming
　　Stone has been friends with people since very, very early.
　　In the Stone Age, stone helped people make various simple tools, defeat wild beasts, and obtain food.
　　Stone-structured houses are much earlier and more solid than brick-structured houses. Which house, palace, or temple can be built without stone as a cornerstone?
　　In wars, stones were made into stone balls to strike enemies.
　　The best roads in ancient times were paved with stone slabs.
　　However, after people passed through the Stone Age and the Bronze Age and entered the Steel Age, the status of stone in people's minds plummeted.
　　Is stone really inferior to steel? No, stone is not reconciled to its backwardness and started a "revolution," which resulted in the "cast stone" industry. Since then, stone has restored its youth in serving humanity.
　　The stone is thrown into a molten stone furnace with a temperature of over 3,000 degrees. After two or three hours, it becomes like molten iron, turning into red-hot stone water, bubbling and frothing. After this smelting, when it cools and solidifies, it is truly reborn, its structure changes, and its character changes.
　　The new stone has found a good job serving humanity. It is cast into various mechanical parts, which are lightweight, high-strength, not afraid of vibration and impact, have stable properties, and are particularly wear-resistant. It can also be cast into pipes and pipe fittings under 250 millimeters. Using this kind of pipe to transport chemical solutions means it is not afraid of acid, alkali, or corrosion.
　　When a coke transportation trough made of high-grade steel—manganese steel—is used to transport 300,000 tons of coke, it is completely worn out and "disabled," but the stone trough remains intact after transporting the same amount of coke.
　　The lifespan of stone is now twenty-five times longer than that of steel!
　　Previously, stone had no place in the interior decoration of buildings, but with cast stone, the originally clumsy stone has been cast into various exquisite, beautiful, and strong decorative accessories, which are even more popular than plaster decorative accessories.
　　Iron ore reserves are, after all, limited, and the establishment of a steel base also requires various conditions. But stone is available everywhere in the mountains and fields, truly inexhaustible.
　　The cast stone industry has begun to develop in the Soviet Union. In the near future, we will definitely see this new ally of steel on our country's industrial front.

### 石头——钢铁同盟军

    石头——钢铁同盟军	路明
    石头，很早很早就和人交了朋友。
    在石器时代，石头帮助了人制成了各种简单的工具，打败了野兽，取得了食物。
    石结构的房子要比砖结构的房子早得多，而且也坚固得多，哪一间房子，哪一座宫殿或庙堂，能离开石头做基石呢？
    在战争中石头被做成石球，打击过敌人。
    古代最好的道路是用石板铺成的。
    可是，当人们走过了石器时代，青铜器时代，而进入钢铁时代以后，石头在人心目中的地位就一落千丈了。
    石头真的不如钢铁了吗？不，石头不甘心自己的落后，闹起“革新”来了，这一闹就闹出个“铸石”工业。从此，石头又恢复它为人类服务的青春。
    石头被投进了温度三千多度的熔石炉，经过两三个小时，它就像熔化了的铁水一样，也变成火红的石水了，翻腾着，冒着汽泡。经过这一番熔炼，当它冷凝以后，真是脱了胎，换了骨，结构变了，性格也变了。
    新的石头找到了为人类服务的好工作。它被浇铸成各种机械配件，重量轻，强度高，不怕震动和撞击，性格稳定，特别耐磨。它也可以被浇成二百五十毫米以下的管子和管子配件。用这种管子运送化学溶液，不怕酸，不怕碱，不受侵蚀。
    当用高级的钢材——锰钢做的焦碳运输槽，运了三十万吨焦碳以后，就全部磨损而“残废”了，但石槽在运了同样多的焦碳以后，却安然无恙。
    石头的寿命从此比钢铁还要长二十五倍！
    以前，在房屋建筑的室内装饰工程中，是没有石头的地位的，可是有了铸石以后，本来是笨头笨脑的石头，也都被铸成各种精巧的、美丽而又结实的装饰配件，比起石膏装饰配件来，更加受人欢迎。
    铁矿藏量毕竟有限，而且要建立一个钢铁基地，也需要种种条件。可是石头呢，漫山遍野都有，真是取之不尽，用之不竭。
    铸石工业在苏联已经开始发展了，不久的将来，在我国的工业战线上，一定也会看到这支新的钢铁的同盟军。
