Taiyuan, April 14th – Factories and mines in Taiyuan City are universally adjusting employee dormitories according to production units. Currently, eighteen factories and mines, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Taiyuan Textile Factory, have already carried out major adjustments to employee dormitories.

After the large-scale adjustment of employee dormitories, the rest times of employees in the same dormitory are consistent, they get better rest, and are more energetic during production. Moreover, it is also convenient for employees to conduct political and theoretical studies, as well as technical and cultural learning. Employees from the same workshop and the same shift live together, changing the previous situation of "being together at work but not seeing each other after work," which allows them to better help and care for each other, enhance employee solidarity, and is conducive to common progress. Party committee secretaries, factory directors, section chiefs and other leading cadres of various units have moved into the dormitory areas together with the workers, eating and living with them. This enables leading cadres to better integrate with the workers, easily understand the workers' thoughts and lives in a timely manner, better educate the workers, and promote production development. After the adjustment of dormitories, many employees' families have launched a surge in running factories and collective welfare undertakings.

    太原市普遍调整职工宿舍
    本报太原14日电　太原市各厂矿普遍按照生产单位调整职工宿舍。现在，全市已经有太原钢铁公司、太原纺织厂等十八个厂矿进行了职工宿舍的大调整。
    大规模调整职工宿舍以后，一个宿舍的职工休息时间一致，休息得好，生产时精力更加充沛，而且也便于职工进行政治理论学习和技术、文化学习。同一个车间、同一个班次的职工住在一起，改变了过去“上班在一起，下班不见面”的情况，可以更好地互相帮助，互相关照，增强职工的团结，有利于共同进步。各单位的党委书记、厂长、工段长等领导干部，都和工人一起搬进了宿舍区，和工人同吃同住。这样，就使领导干部更好地和职工打成一片，便于及时了解职工的思想和生活，更好地向职工进行教育，促进生产发展。许多职工家属在调整宿舍以后，掀起了大办工厂和集体福利事业的热潮。
