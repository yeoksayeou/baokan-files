Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

    I will now briefly introduce the work situation in my own position to the conference.

    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the efforts of all employees and the assistance of Soviet experts, and thanks to adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously promoting rapid construction, vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously developing diversified operations, and vigorously promoting communist cooperation, the building installation industry of the Ministry of Construction Engineering achieved continued leaps forward in 1959. Since the beginning of this year, thanks to the widespread and in-depth movement of studying and implementing Mao Zedong Thought among all employees, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously developing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is unfolding vigorously in building installation enterprises across the country. Everywhere presents a brand new scene of all things renewed and a riot of color, breaking the old convention of slackness at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the month, and realizing a good start, a red streak every ten days, and a red streak every month. The amount of construction and installation work completed in the first quarter accounted for 24.5% of the annual planned task, an increase of 88% over the same period last year. The excellent engineering quality increased from 90% last year to 94.4%. The labor productivity of construction and installation workers increased by 1.12 times compared with the same period last year. Now I will only report on several major tasks to the conference. Please correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

  I. Vigorously promote rapid construction. Rapid construction is a concentrated expression of building installation enterprises implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. According to statistics for the fourth quarter of last year, the number of projects implementing rapid construction in building installation enterprises across the country has reached 57% of all construction projects. The construction period has been generally shortened by more than half, and some have been shortened several times. The Great Hall of the People and other ten major projects in the capital are examples of rapid construction. These projects have a construction area of more than 700,000 square meters. Not only are the structures complex, the functional requirements are very strict, and the technical standards are very high, but many of them are at the cutting edge of current construction technology. From design and preparation to completion and use, it only took ten months. The quality of the project all reached excellent, which is a miracle in the history of construction in our country. It has not only been praised by central leaders, but also praised by delegations from many brother countries, who believe that both the construction speed and the engineering quality are world-class. Compared with many advanced countries, the current technical equipment level of the building installation industry in our country is very low. However, why can we achieve such high speed and high quality? This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, a victory for vigorously launching mass movements, and a victory for vigorously promoting communist cooperation.

    In-depth investigation and research, correct analysis of the situation, mastery of production laws, and then concentrating forces, focusing on key points, and fighting annihilation wars, opposing dividing forces and fighting attrition wars, completing one, then building another, completing a batch, then building another batch, is the concrete application of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking in building construction. Because we have studied and applied this set of strategic guidelines, we can more correctly judge the subjective and objective conditions, strive for time and space as much as possible, and, according to the principle of shortening the battle line and fighting a quick battle, weigh the pros and cons, distinguish between the primary and secondary, focus on key points, take care of the general, and make overall strategic deployments in batches and phases. Under the condition of obeying the key points, promote the early construction and completion of general projects. Under the leadership of the Central Committee and local party committees, the whole country and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions implement unified project scheduling, unified supply, unified allocation, and unified processing and matching of materials and supplies, and unified construction command and organization of communist large-scale collaboration. According to the characteristics of the project, different construction methods are adopted. Some adopt the deployment of organizing joint large corps operations and conducting roundabout mobile warfare; some adopt the organization of battles in phases and batches to carry out assaults; for industrial buildings, construction is organized according to the requirements of industrial production flow, and for civil buildings, construction is organized by building by building and layer by layer. Under strict organization and careful planning, implement the "three simultaneities" and "five quicks" method of designing, preparing, and constructing simultaneously, and quick design, quick preparation, quick construction, quick installation, and quick finishing. Concentrate all efforts to ensure the early completion of the project.

    Currently, rapid construction has become a common construction method. Various regions have organized spring campaigns, and a large number of projects have been completed ahead of schedule. The completed area in the first quarter of this year increased by about 72% compared with the same period last year, which is the highest peak in history. The completion rate for the whole year is planned to reach more than 80% of the construction area, and the rapid construction area reaches 85%. % or more, shortening the construction period by 20% to 50% on the basis of last year. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, we will surely victoriously, more, faster, better, and more economically deliver a large number of projects to production and use ahead of schedule, and make rapid construction even more brilliant.

    II. Vigorously develop "fourizations" - mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. How to quickly realize mechanized construction in building installation enterprises has been the subject of much debate before 1958. However, because we have studied and mastered Chairman Mao's entire set of guidelines for walking on two legs, and applied Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and revolutionary stages, we have found a Chinese-style shortcut, thus smoothly solving the problem of building installation enterprises quickly realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization construction.

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in building installation enterprises, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, started from the "lay down the carrying pole" movement in 1958. It has gone through the stages of mobilizing the masses, adapting to local conditions, relying on self-reliance, drawing drawings by ourselves, making our own machines, and innovating machines blooming everywhere; and then through the stages of selection, finalization, matching, consolidation, and improvement. Especially since the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, it has rapidly set off a magnificent mass movement to vigorously develop machine matching "one-stop." In recent months, it has entered a new stage of advancing from changing manual operation to mechanization and semi-mechanization, to machine matching, integrated linkage, and mechanized operation, automation and semi-automation. The current development of the movement has developed from local technical innovation to joint multi-trade, the entire production process, and even the technical transformation of the entire construction site and workshop. According to incomplete statistics from the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang alone, more than 2,000 units of single-machine automation and nearly 1,000 units of linkage and automation and semi-automation production lines have been realized in more than a dozen trades such as woodworking, steel bar processing, concrete mixing, component prefabrication, plastering, plumbing, electricians, vertical and horizontal transportation. Among them, Liaoning Province has realized 890 units of single-machine automation and 528 units of linkage and automation and semi-automation production lines in just over a month, and has developed from using wired electrical control to light and sound control. The concrete linkage production line successfully trial-produced by the Second Municipal Engineering Office of Harbin City after eight days and nights of hard work combines nine processes into one, and transforms from manual operation to mechanized and automated operation. The number of production workers has been reduced from 84 to 4. The brick transporting machine of Andong City Construction Company can automatically transport bricks from the ground to a height of 36 meters. Therefore, the workers excitedly said: "Automation is really commendable, it doesn't take effort and the efficiency is great, operating the electric button while sitting on the sofa, everyone praises it, production is happy like playing, the Party's leadership is really great." They also said, "Put down the cart and drive the machine, put the red bricks into the brick transporting machine, thank the Party's good leadership, thank the leader Chairman Mao." Because the construction department has found this shortcut, its level of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased dramatically. In just over two months, the degree of mechanized and semi-mechanized construction in Liaoning Province increased from 32.9% at the end of last year to 54%, and the number of workers engaged in manual operation and heavy physical labor decreased from 74% to 38%. The degree of mechanized and semi-mechanized construction in Shanghai increased from 24.6% last year to 58.29%, and the number of workers engaged in manual operation decreased from 70% to 30%; because the degree of mechanized and semi-mechanized construction of the Nanjing Municipal Construction Bureau increased by 20.17%, it saved an average of 4,800 workers. Many types of work have reached the point where one person can top several people, and work efficiency has increased several times over. We guarantee to complete the target of increasing the labor productivity of building installation enterprises by 20% compared with last year mentioned by Vice Premier Li Fuchun in his report, and we will definitely overfulfill it.

    Due to the development of mechanization and semi-mechanization, the task of machine manufacturing has greatly increased, and the level of assembly can also be greatly improved. In order to meet this requirement, we will continue to follow the policy of walking on two legs, adopt factory-style and semi-factory-style methods to vigorously develop building bases, and create conditions for further improvement of the building installation industry.

    III. Vigorously develop new structures and new materials. In the past, my country's building structure and construction technology were relatively backward. Because we implemented Chairman Mao's working method of breaking through one point and driving the whole area in this regard, the technical level of construction and installation enterprises across the country has been greatly improved. We use key construction sites in the central government and provinces and cities as experimental bases, and after gaining experience, we promote it universally. In this way, in just two or three years, provincial and municipal companies have mastered the construction technology of large industrial plants and high-rise public buildings. The degree of prefabrication and factoryization in 1959 has accounted for more than 20% of the entire construction and installation workload, breaking through the technical barriers of prefabrication, hoisting, and welding. Changing the cast-in-place reinforced concrete structure to a prefabricated assembly structure greatly accelerated the construction speed. For example, the Beijing National Hotel project is 48.4 meters high and has 13 floors. The prefabricated assembly technology was used for the second to eleventh floors, and it took only 32 days to complete the three-dimensional frame structure of these ten floors. In order to save steel, large-span prestressed structures have been greatly developed. For example, Beijing and Xi'an have adopted prestressed reinforced concrete block assembled arch trusses with spans of up to 60 to 61 meters, and adopted the construction method of jacking and steel strip jacking, which not only broke the past superstition that steel structures must be used for spans of more than 30 meters, but also adopted construction methods that are at the cutting edge in the world. The prestressed concrete oil tank with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, which was recently successfully trial-produced, can save 61% of steel.

    Currently, the building structure should focus on developing in the direction of reducing the self-weight of the building. At present, the weight per square meter of building area of ​​general single-story industrial plants is about two tons, and the weight per square meter of general residential buildings is about one and a half tons. If the structural weight is reduced by 10%, according to the engineering tasks undertaken by the Ministry of Construction Engineering this year, the amount of transportation can be reduced by 8 million to 10 million tons. Transporting these materials alone requires 1.6 million to 2 million trips of 5-ton trucks, and 270,000 to 330,000 railcars by train. Due to the reduction in the amount of materials used, the transportation costs and labor volume during the manufacturing, handling and installation of components are also greatly reduced, thereby speeding up the construction speed. Therefore, reducing the self-weight of buildings is essentially an important aspect of building installation enterprises realizing high speed and implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. At present, various regions have achieved preliminary results in reducing the self-weight of buildings. For example, the use of blast furnace slag as aggregate for large blocks can reduce the self-weight by 10%; the use of pumice concrete to make prestressed large roof panels and floor slabs can reduce it by 30%; the use of perforated bricks, hollow bricks, and slag bricks to build houses can reduce the wall weight by more than 40%; if 18-meter prestressed roof trusses are made of 800# cement and 1000# concrete, each truss can reduce its self-weight by 47% compared to general prestressed concrete roof trusses. The comprehensive use of these new structures can reduce the weight of the entire workshop by about 45% compared to general workshops. In order to further improve construction technology and widely adopt new structures, the Ministry of Construction has decided to vigorously promote five new structures and new construction technologies: assembled concrete, prestressed concrete, thin shells, suspension cables, and steel wire mesh cement, and to focus on promoting prestressed cylindrical and tank-shaped structures. This will greatly leap forward the technical level of building installation enterprises in my country.

    Fully utilizing industrial and agricultural waste, vigorously developing comprehensive utilization, and manufacturing lightweight building materials are important measures to reduce the weight of buildings. In the past two years, because we have conscientiously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's spirit of going all out and aiming high, and have widely mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of enterprises and the vast number of employees, we have more fully utilized the waste materials of the construction enterprises themselves and local industries and agriculture, and have opened up a wide range of sources of building materials. Greatly enhanced the initiative of building installation enterprises. Two aspects are particularly worth introducing. The first is the comprehensive utilization of wood processing waste and other plant fibers. Generally speaking, processing 10,000 cubic meters of planks will leave 1,000 to 2,000 cubic meters of waste materials such as bark, shavings, flakes, and sawdust. Our ministry needs about 2.8 million cubic meters of wood this year, which will produce 280,000 to 560,000 cubic meters of waste materials. If this batch of waste materials is utilized, a large amount of particleboard, wood wool board, wood chipboard, fiberboard, etc. can be produced. Unusable waste sawdust can also be distilled to make alcohol, and the leftovers after alcohol production are the raw materials for making bakelite products. In addition, the use of other various plant fibers can also produce similar products. The second is the use of industrial and mining enterprise fly ash, slag, and mine slag to manufacture wall blocks and reinforced concrete components. These waste materials are a burden to the city if they are discarded and not used. Full utilization can save a lot of cement. For example, small blast furnaces are everywhere, and the amount of slag accumulated by various factories is increasing. According to surveys in various places, generally only about 5% to 10% can be utilized, but this is an excellent building material. Henan Province has used slag to build several buildings and manufactured many slag bricks, using slag as a foundation cushion, as ground walls, as slag concrete, and as slag silicate products. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, Tianjin plans to produce a large number of fly ash slag blocks and slag lime reinforced concrete components this year. Shandong Province is vigorously promoting wet-milled slag concrete, which can save a lot of cement and a lot of farmland. It is estimated that the fly ash in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Fushun alone can be made into 4.6 million cubic meters of large blocks every year, which can replace 2.3 billion clay bricks, can build 10 million square meters of civil buildings, and can reduce the occupation of 3,300 acres of farmland. Therefore, it is also a measure for industry to support agriculture. Not only that, the blocks and components made of these waste materials are also lightweight and high-strength, so they can also reduce the weight of buildings. Therefore, promoting this type of component has the effect of "killing three birds with one stone."

    Fellow committee members: In the first year of the 1960s, our building installation enterprises, like all fronts across the country, are a magnificent and beautiful scene. I am determined to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, further conscientiously study and study Chairman Mao's writings, thoroughly transform my thinking, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and ensure that I listen to the Party and go wherever the Party directs. I am determined to strive to be an intellectual who is both red and expert. I will definitely do my best to jointly complete this year's building installation tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, and strive for the victory of the all-round realization of high-speed sustained leap forward, and for winning a good start in the first year of the 1960s.

    在建筑安装工业中大搞快速施工
    吴世鹤委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    我现在就自己工作岗位上的工作情况向大会作简单介绍。
    建筑工程部建筑安装工业，由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导，由于全体职工的努力和苏联专家的帮助，由于坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动、大搞快速施工、大搞技术革新和技术革命、大搞多种经营、大搞共产主义协作，取得了1959年的继续跃进。今年以来，由于全体职工普遍而深入地开展了学习与贯彻毛泽东思想的运动，一个以大搞机械化半机械化自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新技术革命运动，正在全国建筑安装企业里轰轰烈烈展开，到处呈现着一派万象皆新、万紫千红的崭新景象，打破了历年来年初松、月初松的老常规，实现了开门红、旬旬红、月月红。第一季度完成的建筑安装工作量占今年全年计划任务24.5％，比去年同期增加88％，优良的工程质量由去年的90％提高到94.4％，建筑安装工人的劳动生产率比去年同期增加一点一二倍。现在我仅就几项主要工作向大会汇报，不当之处尚望指正。
  一、大搞快速施工。快速施工是建筑安装企业贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的集中表现。据去年第四季度的统计，全国建筑安装企业实行快速施工的工程已经达到全部施工工程的57％，施工工期普遍地缩短一半以上，有些缩短几倍。首都人民大会堂等十大工程，就是快速施工的范例。这批工程建筑面积达七十多万平方米，不仅结构复杂，功能要求很严，技术标准很高，而且其中有很多是目前建筑技术上的尖端，从设计、准备到交工使用，只用了十个月的时间，工程质量全部达到优等，这是我国建筑史上的奇迹，不仅得到了中央领导同志的赞许，而且得到许多兄弟国家代表团的推崇，认为无论是建设速度或工程质量都是世界第一流的。我国建筑安装工业目前的技术装备水平和许多先进国家比较起来都是很低的，但是，为什么能够实现这样的高速优质呢？这是毛主席的战略思想的伟大胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，是大搞共产主义协作的胜利。
    深入调查研究，正确分析形势，掌握生产规律，然后集中力量，重点突击，打歼灭战，反对分兵把口，打消耗战，建成一个，再建一个，建成一批，再建一批，这是毛主席的战略思想在建筑施工上的具体运用。由于我们学习和运用了这套战略方针，所以就能比较正确地判断主客观条件，尽可能地争取时间和空间，根据缩短战线速战速决的原则，权衡轻重，分清主次，突击重点，照顾一般，分批分期的作总体的战略部署，在服从重点的条件下，促进一般工程的提前施工和完工。全国和省市自治区在中央和当地党委的领导下，实行统一工程排队，实行材料物资的统一供应、统一调配和统一加工配套，统一施工指挥和组织共产主义大协作。根据工程特点采取不同的施工方法，有的采取组织联合大兵团作战，轮回打运动战的部署；有的采取分期分批的组织战役进行突击；对工业建筑则采取按工业生产流程要求组织施工，对民用建筑则采用分栋、分层干完一个再干一个组织施工。在严密的组织和周密计划下，实行边设计、边准备、边施工和快设计、快准备、快施工、快安装、快结尾的“三边”“五快”的办法。集中全力保证工程提前完工。
    目前，快速施工已成为普遍的施工方法，各个地区组织了春季战役，大批的工程提前竣工，今年第一季度竣工面积比去年同期增长约72％，为历史上的最高峰，今年全年竣工率计划达到开工面积80％以上，快速施工面达85％。以上，在去年的基础上再缩短工期20％至50％。在毛主席的战略思想指导下，我们一定能胜利地、更多快好省地使大批工程提前交付生产和使用，使快速施工更加大放异彩。
    二、大搞“四化”——机械化半机械化自动化半自动化。建筑安装企业如何迅速实现机械化施工，在1958年以前曾有不少的争论，但是由于我们学习和掌握了毛主席的两条腿走路的一整套方针，运用了毛主席的不断革命论和革命阶段论，我们找到一条中国式的捷径，从而顺利地解决了建筑安装企业迅速实现机械化半机械化施工的问题。
    建筑安装企业的以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，是从1958年“放下扁担”运动开始的，经过了发动群众，因工因地制宜，自力更生，自绘图样，自造机具，革新机具遍地开花；再通过选型、定型、配套和巩固提高的阶段；特别是从贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议以后，迅速地掀起了一个波澜壮阔大搞机具配套“一条龙”的群众运动。最近几个月以来，已经进入了以变手工操作为机械化半机械化为中心，向机具配套成龙联动化、机械操作自动化半自动化进军的新阶段。当前运动的发展，已经由局部的技术革新发展到多工种联合、整个生产工艺流程、甚至整个工地、车间的技术改造。仅根据辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三个省的不完全统计，已在木作、钢筋加工、混凝土搅拌、构件预制、抹灰、水暖、电工、垂直与水平运输等十几个工种中，实现了两千多台单机自动化和近千条联动化、自动化半自动化生产线。其中，辽宁省仅在一个多月的时间内，就实现了八百九十台单机自动化和五百二十八条联动化和自动化半自动化生产线，并且由采用有线电气控制，发展到光、声控制。哈尔滨市第二市政工程处奋战八昼夜试制成功的混凝土联动化生产线，将九道工序合而为一，由手工操作一跃而为机械化、自动化作业，生产工人由八十四人减到四人。安东市建筑公司的运砖机，可以由地面自动输送到三十六米高的高空。因此，工人兴奋地说：“自动化真可夸，不费力来效率大，操纵电钮坐沙发，十人见了十人夸，生产愉快像玩耍，党的领导真伟大。”又说“放下推车开机器，红砖放入运砖机，感谢党的领导好，感谢领袖毛主席。”建筑部门由于找到了这条捷径，它的机械化半机械化水平飞跃增长。辽宁省仅仅在两个多月的时间，全省机械化半机械化施工程度，由去年年底的32.9％，提高到54％，手工操作和笨重体力劳动的工人由74％减到38％。上海市机械化半机械化施工程度由去年的24.6％，提高到58.29％，手工操作的工人由70％下降到30％；南京市城建局由于机械化半机械化施工程度提高了20.17％，就平均节约了四千八百名工人，许多工种达到一人顶几人，工效翻几番。李富春副总理在报告中所提的今年建筑安装企业劳动生产率较去年提高20％的指标，我们保证完成，并且一定能超额完成。
    由于机械化半机械化的发展，机具制造任务大大增大了，装配化水平也可以大大提高了。为了适应这一要求，我们将继续遵照两条腿走路的方针，采用工厂化半工厂化的方法大力发展建筑基地，为建筑安装工业的进一步提高创造条件。
    三、大力发展新结构和新材料。过去我国建筑结构和施工技术是比较落后的，由于我们在这方面贯彻了毛主席的突破一点带动全面的工作方法，使全国建筑安装企业的施工技术水平飞跃提高。我们是通过中央和省市的重点工地作为试验基地，取得经验后普遍推广。这样，在短短两三年的时间内，就使省市公司都掌握了大型工业厂房和高层公共建筑的施工技术，预制装配和工厂化程度在1959年已经占整个建筑安装工作量的20％以上，突破了预制、吊装和焊接的技术关，把现浇钢筋混凝土结构改为预制装配结构，就大大地加快了建设速度。例如北京的民族饭店工程，高四十八点四米，高十三层，其中第二层到第十一层，采用预制装配技术，只用了三十二天就完成了这十层的立体框架结构。为了节约钢材，大跨度预应力结构有了很大发展，像北京、西安都采用了长达六十至六十一米跨度的预应力钢筋混凝土块体拼装式拱形屋架，并采用了用千斤顶和钢带顶升的施工方法，不仅打破了过去所谓三十米以上跨度就必须采用钢结构的迷信，而且采取了在世界上也是尖端的施工方法。最近突击试制成功五千立米的预应力混凝土油罐可以节约钢材61％。
    当前在建筑结构上应该着重向减轻建筑物自重的方向发展。目前，我国一般单层工业厂房每平米建筑面积的重量约两吨左右，一般居住建筑每平米重量一吨半左右，如果减轻结构重量10％，按今年建筑工程部承担的工程任务来说，就可以减少运输量八百至一千万吨，光运输这些材料就需要五吨的载重汽车一百六十至二百万辆次，用火车运也得二十七至三十三万节车皮。由于材料用量减轻，构件在制造、搬运和安装过程的运输费用和劳动量也大为降低，从而加快了施工速度。因此，减轻建筑物自重，实质上是建筑安装企业实现高速度贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的一个重要方面。目前各地在减轻建筑物自重已取得初步成效，如采用炉渣作骨料的大型砌块，即可降低自重10％；采用浮石混凝土制成予应力大型屋面板和楼板可减轻30％；采用多孔砖、空心砖、矿渣砖制造房屋可减轻墙重40％以上；十八米予应力屋架，如果用八百号水泥，制造的一千号混凝土制作比一般予应力混凝土屋架每榀可以减轻自重47％，综合采用这些新结构就能使整个车间的重量比一般车间的重量减少45％左右。为了进一步提高施工技术，广泛地采用新结构，中建部决定今年大力推行装配式混凝土、予应力混凝土、薄壳、悬索、钢丝网水泥五种新结构和新施工技术，并且有重点地推行予应力筒形、罐形结构，这样，将使我国建筑安装企业的施工技术水平大大地跃进一步。
    充分利用工农业废料，大搞综合利用，制造轻质建筑材料是当前减轻建筑物重量的重要措施。两年以来，由于我们认真地学习和贯彻了毛主席的鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，广泛地调动了企业和广大职工的积极性和创造性，较充分地利用了建筑企业本身和当地工农业的废料，广辟建筑材料之源，大大地增强了建筑安装企业的主动性。特别值得介绍的有两个方面，第一是综合利用木材加工的废料和其他植物纤维。一般地讲，加工一万立米的板材，就要剩下一千至二千立米的板皮，刨花、板片、木屑等废料，拿我部今年约需二百八十万立米木材，就要出二十八至五十六万立米的废料，如果把这批废料利用，就能制出大量的刨花板、木丝板、木屑板、纤维板等，实在不能用的废木屑，还可蒸馏制酒精，制完酒精剩下的下脚，就是制作电木制品的原料。此外，利用其他各种植物纤维，同样也能制成与此类似的产品。第二是工矿企业烟灰炉渣矿渣制造墙砌块和钢筋混凝土构件。这些废料弃置不用是城市的累赘，充分利用就可以节约大量水泥。如各地小高炉林立，各厂堆积的矿渣愈来愈多，据各地调查，一般仅能利用5％至10％左右，但这就是极好的建筑材料，河南省已用矿渣建成几幢楼房，并且制造许多矿渣砖，利用矿渣作基础垫层，作地墙，作矿渣混凝土，作矿渣矽酸盐制品。天津市在市委领导下今年准备大量制作烟灰炉渣砌块和炉渣石灰钢筋混凝土构件，山东省正在大力推广湿碾矿渣混凝土，从而可以节约大量水泥和大量农田。据估计仅仅上海、天津、抚顺三处的烟灰就每年可制成大型砌块四百六十万立米，可代替二十三亿块粘土砖，可建造一千万平米的民用建筑，可减少占用农田三千三百亩。因此它也是工业支援农业的一个措施，不仅如此，这些废料制成的砌块构件还轻质高强，因此同时也能减轻建筑物的重量。因此推广这类构件具有“一箭三雕”之功。
    各位委员：在这六十年代的头一年，我们建筑安装企业和全国各个战线一样，是一幅宏伟壮丽的大好景象。我决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，进一步认真学习与钻研毛主席著作，彻底改造思想，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，保证听党的话，党指向那里就奔向那里，决心争取作一个又红又专的知识分子，一定尽最大的努力，共同把今年的建筑安装任务完成得更多、更快、更好、更省，为全面实现高速度持续跃进的胜利，为夺取六十年代的头年开门红而奋斗。
