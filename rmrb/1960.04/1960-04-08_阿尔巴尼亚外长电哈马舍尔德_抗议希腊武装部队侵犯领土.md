Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 5th. Albanian Foreign Minister Shtra sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 4th, protesting the violation of Albanian territory by Greek armed forces on the 4th.

The telegram stated that at 7:30 AM on April 4th, a team of Greek soldiers, commanded by an officer, violated the Albanian-Greek border between boundary markers 28 and 29 in the Kapstice area and penetrated 500 meters into Albanian territory. When the Albanian border guards saw the Greek soldiers, they immediately notified them to retreat and repeatedly pointed out that they had penetrated Albanian territory. However, the Greek forces responded to the Albanian patrol's call and goodwill with gunfire. In self-defense, the Albanian patrol was forced to return fire. In the exchange, one Greek soldier was killed; his body and weapons were found within Albanian territory, 400 meters from the border. The Albanian government strongly protests the violation of Albanian territory by Greek armed forces and demands that the Greek government permanently cease such unreasonable and dangerous actions.

The Albanian Foreign Minister pointed out in the telegram that the Albanian government follows a policy of peace and has always actively sought to establish normal and neighborly relations with Greece. However, the Greek government has adopted a very negative attitude towards the Albanian government's peaceful actions and has repeatedly endangered the integrity and security of Albanian territory. This proves that the Greek government has not abandoned its policy of hostility towards Albania.

The telegram concluded by stating that the purpose of this provocation by the Greek authorities is to worsen relations between the two neighboring countries, to obstruct the establishment of an atmosphere of understanding in the Balkans, and to hinder efforts to consolidate peace. The government of the People's Republic of Albania reserves the right to take further measures in response to this provocation, and it considers it necessary to draw the attention of the United Nations to the dangers of the Greek government's policy of endangering Balkan peace and international cooperation.

    阿尔巴尼亚外长电哈马舍尔德
    抗议希腊武装部队侵犯领土
    新华社地拉那5日电　阿尔巴尼亚外交部长什图拉4日致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，就希腊武装部队4日侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领土一事提出了抗议。
    电报中说，4月4日上午七点三十分一队希腊士兵由一军官指挥在卡普什蒂策地区二十八——二十九界标之间侵犯了阿希边界，并且向阿尔巴尼亚领土深入了五百米。当阿尔巴尼亚边防部队看到了希腊士兵以后，当即通知他们后退，并且一再指出他们已深入了阿尔巴尼亚领土。但是，希腊武装对阿尔巴尼亚巡逻队的这一呼唤和良好态度的回答却是开枪射击。阿尔巴尼亚巡逻队为了自卫被迫还击。在互相射击中有一名希腊士兵被打死，他的尸体和武器在阿尔巴尼亚境内距边界四百米处被发现。阿尔巴尼亚政府对希腊武装部队侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领土一事坚决地提出抗议，并且要求希腊政府永远停止这种无理和危险的行动。
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部长在电报中指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府遵循和平政策，它一向积极地争取同希腊建立正常和睦邻的关系。但是，希腊政府对阿尔巴尼亚政府的和平行动却采取十分恶劣的态度，并且一再危及阿尔巴尼亚领土的完整和安全。这证明希腊政府并没有放弃它敌视阿尔巴尼亚的政策。
    电报最后说，希腊当局的这一挑衅的目的在于恶化两个邻国的关系，在于阻挠建立巴尔干的谅解气氛和阻碍对巩固和平的努力。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府保留对这一挑衅采取进一步措施的权利，它并且认为有必要提请联合国注意希腊政府危害巴尔干和平和国际合作的政策的危险性。
