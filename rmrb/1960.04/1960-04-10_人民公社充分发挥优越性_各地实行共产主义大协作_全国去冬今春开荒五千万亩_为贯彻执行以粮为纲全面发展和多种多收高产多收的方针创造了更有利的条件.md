Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: Since last autumn and winter, a mass land reclamation movement has been launched across the country, and many new "virgin lands" have been reclaimed. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of the end of March, twenty provinces and autonomous regions, including Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, have reclaimed 50 million mu of cultivated land, equivalent to more than 60% of the total area reclaimed during China's First Five-Year Plan. This has laid a good foundation for further implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link, all-round development," "planting more, harvesting more, and achieving high yields" and realizing continuous leaps forward in agricultural production this year.

The newly reclaimed cultivated land is mainly distributed in South China, Northwest China, and coastal areas. Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei and other densely populated provinces have also reclaimed more than 20 million mu of river滩 (tān) and lake滩 (tān). Of the newly reclaimed cultivated land, rural people's communes reclaimed 40 million mu, and state-owned farm systems and farms run by the military, government agencies, and schools reclaimed more than 10 million mu. Of these newly reclaimed cultivated lands, 10 million mu were planted with overwintering crops last winter, and the rest will be planted with spring-sown crops.

China has a large amount of wasteland resources. According to estimates by the Wasteland Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the total number of reclaimable wasteland after surveying and investigation reaches about 1.7 billion mu, which is slightly larger than China's existing total cultivated land area. Large areas of raw wasteland are mainly distributed in Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and coastal areas. Many wastelands have fertile soil and sufficient water sources, making them suitable for large-scale development and planting of crops. Since liberation, while increasing the yield per unit area of crops, various regions have actively reclaimed a lot of wasteland. State-owned farm systems have reclaimed a large amount of cultivated land in Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and South China, and established state-owned farms, such as the Mudanjiang and Hejiang reclamation areas built by Heilongjiang Province; the reclamation areas built by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps north and south of the Tianshan Mountains; and the reclamation areas built in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. With the development of water conservancy construction, the masses in the interior have also reclaimed a large amount of cultivated land. In order to further implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development, various regions are formulating annual and long-term land reclamation plans on the basis of surveying and investigation, and mobilizing the masses to vigorously reclaim land. As a result, a land reclamation movement, larger in scale than any previous year, has quickly unfolded in various regions, and the broad masses of cadres and people have plunged into the battle to march towards the wasteland, awakening the land that has been dormant for thousands of years.

The rural people's communes have more abundant manpower and material resources than the agricultural cooperatives, and the state-owned land reclamation system has even more powerful agricultural machinery. This is an important reason for the rapid progress of land reclamation. People's communes in Guangdong Province organized 1.37 million people to march towards wasteland and barren mountains, reclaiming more than 9 million mu of cultivated land, greatly exceeding the province's original plan to reclaim 5 million mu. The land reclamation expedition team of more than 17,000 people from the people's communes in Wangjiang County, Anhui Province, leading more than 3,000 head of cattle and four tractors, reclaimed land in Qingcao Lake, achieving fast progress and good quality. The people's communes in 22 counties including Hukou, Duchang, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Boyang in Jiangxi Province organized 110,000 male and female commune members, concentrated more than 170 tractors and a large number of cattle, and carried grain and grass into the Poyang Lake area, reclaiming a large amount of cultivated land. The land reclamation work of the people's communes in the Xinjiang region has progressed quite rapidly and with good quality, thanks to the purchase of more than 260 tractors and more than 1,000 large agricultural implements after communization, and the self-manufacture of a large number of agricultural implements and vehicles by commune-run industries.

The great promotion of the spirit of collaboration in various regions is also one of the important reasons for the large scale and rapid progress of land reclamation. Communes and regions with small land reclamation tasks and abundant machinery and labor force actively support regions with large land reclamation tasks and less machinery and labor force. People's communes and state-owned farms in counties and cities such as Huojia, Tangyin, Anyang, and Xinxiang in Henan Province transferred 56 tractors and 200 tractor drivers to support the reclamation of滩 (tān) land and saline-alkali wasteland in Yuanyang, Yanjin, Changyuan, Jixian, Junxian, and Neihuang counties. People's communes and state-owned farms in agricultural areas of Qinghai Province transferred 86 tractors, more than 400 tractor drivers, repairmen, and corresponding management personnel to support land reclamation in pastoral areas with larger land reclamation tasks. Many people's communes and state-owned farms and tractor stations in counties such as Wuyuan, Wuning, and Xiushui in Jiangxi Province also sent expedition teams or transferred tractors, cattle, agricultural implements, etc., to support the reclamation of lake田 (tián)洲 (zhōu) land in the Poyang Lake area. The expeditionary land reclamation team organized by the Beidahuang Reclamation Area has successfully completed its task of supporting land reclamation in Guangdong, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces, and returned to the reclamation area.

All regions pay attention to reclaiming and benefiting in the same year, and also pay attention to the basic construction of newly reclaimed wasteland, such as soil improvement, water and soil conservation, and the creation of shelterbelts. The newly reclaimed saline-alkali wasteland in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province has undergone soil improvement, and water and soil conservation work has been done on the newly reclaimed barren mountains in western and southern Anhui. While reclaiming land, various regions in Jiangsu fully prepared for spring plowing and sowing, such as seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers, so as to ensure that every piece of land reclaimed is well planted. Of the millions of mu of wasteland newly reclaimed in various regions of Yunnan Province, more than 2 million mu have been planted with high-yield feed crops.

### 人民公社充分发挥优越性　各地实行共产主义大协作  全国去冬今春开荒五千万亩  为贯彻执行以粮为纲全面发展和多种多收高产多收的方针创造了更有利的条件

    人民公社充分发挥优越性　各地实行共产主义大协作
    全国去冬今春开荒五千万亩
    为贯彻执行以粮为纲全面发展和多种多收高产多收的方针创造了更有利的条件
    新华社9日讯　去年秋冬以来，全国各地开展了群众性的垦荒运动，新垦了不少“处女地”。据农业部统计，到3月底止，安徽、江苏、江西、浙江、福建、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、云南、甘肃、新疆、青海等二十个省和自治区，已新垦出耕地五千万亩，相当于我国第一个五年计划期间垦荒面积总和的60％以上。这为今年农业生产进一步贯彻执行“以粮为纲，全面发展”、“多种多收和高产多收”方针和实现连续跃进，打下了良好的基础。
    新垦的耕地主要分布在华南、西北和沿海地区。人口稠密的山东、安徽、河南、江西、湖北等省也新垦了河滩和湖滩等两千多万亩。在新垦出的耕地中，农村人民公社开垦的占四千万亩，国营农场系统和部队、机关、学校农场开垦的占一千多万亩。在这些新垦的耕地中，去冬已种植了一千万亩越冬农作物，其余将全部种上春播作物。
    我国拥有大量的荒地资源，根据农垦部荒地勘测院估计，经过勘测、调查的可垦荒地总数达到十七亿亩左右，这比我国现有的全部耕地面积还略大。大片的生荒地主要分布在东北、西北、西南和沿海地区。许多荒地土质肥沃，水源充足，适宜于大量开发种植农作物。解放以来，各地在提高农作物单位面积产量的同时，积极地开垦了不少荒地。国营农场系统在东北、西北、西南和华南地区垦出大量耕地，建立了国营农场，如黑龙江省开垦建设的牡丹江、合江垦区；新疆军区生产建设兵团在天山南北建设的垦区；在广东、广西和云南等地建设的垦区。随着水利建设的发展，内地的群众也垦出了大量的耕地。各地为了进一步贯彻以粮为纲、全面发展的方针，都在勘测、调查的基础上，拟定当年的和长远的垦荒规划，发动群众，大力垦荒。因而一个规模比过去任何一年都大得多的垦荒运动，很快在各地开展起来，广大的干部和群众投入向荒地进军的战斗，唤醒了千年沉睡的土地。
    农村人民公社人力、物力比农业社时雄厚，国营农垦系统更有威力强大的农业机械，这是垦荒进度快的重要原因。广东省各人民公社组织一百三十七万人，向荒地荒山进军，已垦出耕地九百多万亩，大大超过了省里原订开荒五百万亩的计划。安徽省望江县各人民公社组织的一万七千多人的开荒远征队，牵着三千多头耕牛，开出四部拖拉机，在青草湖开荒，做到了进度快，质量好。江西省湖口、都昌、九江、南昌、波阳等二十二个县的人民公社，组织十一万男女社员，集中一百七十多台拖拉机和大批耕牛，携带粮草进入鄱阳湖滨，已开垦出大量耕地。新疆地区人民公社的垦荒工作，由于公社化后购置了二百六十多台拖拉机，一千多件大型农具，社办工业还自制了大批农具和车辆，因而进度相当快，质量也好。
    各地大兴协作之风，也是使垦荒规模大，进度快的重要原因之一。开荒任务小，机械、劳动力多的公社和地区，都积极支援开荒任务大，机械、劳动力少的地区。河南省获嘉、汤阴、安阳、新乡等县市的人民公社和国营农场，抽调五十六台拖拉机和二百名拖拉机手，支援原阳、延津、长垣、汲县、浚县和内黄等县开垦黄河滩地和盐碱荒地。青海省农业地区的人民公社和国营农场，抽调八十六台拖拉机，四百多名拖拉机手、修理工和相应的管理人员，支援开荒任务较大的牧业区开荒。江西省婺源、武宁、修水等县的许多人民公社和国营农场、拖拉机站，也都派出远征队或抽出拖拉机、耕牛、农具等，支援开垦鄱阳湖滨湖田洲地的工作。北大荒垦区组织的远征垦荒队，已胜利的完成了支援广东、湖北、山东、河北等省的垦荒任务，返回垦区。
    各地都注意当年开垦，当年收益，还注意新垦荒地的基本建设工作，如土壤改良、水土保持和营造防护林带等。安徽省淮北地区新垦的盐碱荒地进行了土壤改良，皖西和皖南新垦的荒山做好了水土保持工作。江苏各地在开荒的同时，就充分做好种子、农药、肥料等春耕播种的各项准备工作，以便做到开垦一块，种好一块。云南省各地新开垦的几百万亩荒地，已有二百多万亩种植了高产饲料作物。（附图片）
