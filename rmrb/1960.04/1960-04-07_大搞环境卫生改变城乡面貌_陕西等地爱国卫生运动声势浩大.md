Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 6th: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held a provincial broadcast mobilization meeting for the Patriotic Health Campaign on the evening of the 1st, calling on the people of the province to immediately launch a new upsurge in the Patriotic Health Campaign with great momentum and unprecedented scale.

    Comrade Zhao Shouyi, alternate secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a mobilization report to the people of the province at the meeting. He asked all parts of the province to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign more extensively and deeply, vigorously eliminate the remnants of the four pests, and, according to the principles of "treating both the symptoms and the root cause, with emphasis on treating the root cause" and "striking early, striking small, and striking thoroughly," adopt various methods to carry out a major encirclement and suppression, and a major sweep of the remaining four pests, eliminating the four pests before they breed. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously carry out fundamental health work, actively promote the "four gardenization" (gardenization, vegetable gardenization, orchardization, medicinal gardenization) of environmental hygiene, vigorously carry out disease prevention and elimination campaigns, and ensure the health of the working people. He said that our slogan is: Establish lofty aspirations, set ambitious goals, make a big splash, create great momentum, eliminate rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes, and vigorously carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign. He called on the whole Party and the whole people to act immediately, work hard, and create greater and more outstanding achievements to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day. He also requested that all localities strengthen the Party's leadership over the Patriotic Health Campaign, with the first secretary of each level of Party organization taking personal command, grasping it firmly, and grasping it to the end. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously, extensively, and meticulously publicize to the masses the great significance of eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, eliminating diseases, changing customs, and transforming the world, creating a new fashion of "taking hygiene as an honor and not paying attention to hygiene as a shame."

    The heads of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Provincial Women's Federation, as well as the Party secretaries of Yan'an, Dali, and Luonan counties and cities, also expressed their determination at the meeting. Nearly half of the rural areas in Yan'an County have been transformed into new sanitary villages, more than 90% of the villages have achieved environmental sanitation "four gardenization," and the county has achieved a collective health care system, ensuring that where there is a production army, there is medicine and medical care, controlling the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. Now, they say, they will act immediately, launch a seven-day blitz to iron and wash all bedding and clothing; launch a ten-day blitz to eliminate bedbugs and lice; eliminate rats and flies before "May 1st," and establish simple bathing ponds in every team within twenty days.

    After the broadcast meeting, all special districts and counties, people's communes, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools in the province immediately convened mobilization meetings led by the first secretary. Zhang Ce, First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on the people of the city at the Xi'an Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign broadcast mobilization meeting to immediately take action, work hard in April, and earnestly achieve "six cleans" (clean streets, courtyards, rooms, utensils, kitchens, and toilets) and "four nots" (no random splashing of sewage, no random dumping of garbage, no random piling of manure, no spitting anywhere), so that hygiene work is regularized, institutionalized, and habitualized.

    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, April 6th: As spring arrives and the ice and snow melt, Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has launched a vigorous spring Patriotic Health Campaign since the 2nd. By the 4th, the accumulated snow, garbage, and dirt in the streets and alleys had been basically cleared, and large-scale cleaning was carried out in government offices and residential areas, and the city's sanitation appearance had been initially improved.

    Party secretaries at all levels have personally taken command and gone into battle. Liu He, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Maimaiti Yiming Yusufu went to various districts for inspection and guidance. The district Party secretaries and district heads of each district also went deep into the streets for inspection, and solved problems in a timely manner, which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the masses. Leading cadres from many government departments led shock teams to participate in shock activities on the streets. Thanks to the importance attached by leaders at all levels and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the shock activities have achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from Tianshan District and Dosluk District alone, more than 36,000 people participated in the shock, 55 propaganda teams were dispatched, 56 broadcasting stations were set up, and more than 430 trucks, floats, and rickshaws were dispatched, clearing all the accumulated snow and mud from an entire road, sweeping more than 100 alleys, dredging more than 10,000 meters of ditches, and transporting more than 6,200 tons of garbage and more than 6,000 tons of accumulated snow.
