(Reported by this newspaper from Hohhot on the 16th) The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement in Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry has been widely launched in grasslands and rural areas, achieving remarkable results.

The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement in Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry developed based on the large number of "high-yield herds" and "experiment herds" that emerged during the Great Leap Forward. Ethnic Mongolian herdsmen and farmers, striving to ensure that every hundred mother animals breed and raise one hundred offspring per year, launched this movement in November of last year. To date, the region has produced 4.7 million young animals (including over 180,000 head of young large livestock), an increase of approximately 1.8 million head compared to the same period last year, with a survival rate of over 93%. Among these newborn young animals, more than 760,000 are improved breeds, also an increase compared to last year. The large-scale spring lambing season has now begun, and even more mother animals throughout the region will continue to give birth.

Due to the implementation of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, the livestock breeding survival rate has rapidly increased. This increase is no longer limited to reducing livestock losses or improving the survival rate of young animals; rather, it is a comprehensive improvement ranging from large livestock to small livestock, from quantity to quality, including planned transitions from one birth per year to immediate mating and breeding for large livestock, and one birth per year to two births per year and multiple offspring per mother for small livestock. This ensures the continuous leap forward in overall animal husbandry production. Because the people's communes have prominently focused on pregnant mother animals and improvement work, the number of large livestock mother animals that have already given birth or are pregnant throughout the region has increased by more than 100,000 head compared to the same period last year, with improved mother animals increasing fivefold; the number of ewes that have already lambed or are pregnant has also increased by more than one million head compared to the same period last year, with improved sheep increasing by more than 600,000 head compared to the same period last year. In this movement, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and relying on the strength of the communes, the broad masses of herdsmen and farmers have continuously strengthened livestock feeding and management, and more than 3,900 "large-scale high-yield herds" have emerged throughout the region. These high-yield herds all produce more than one hundred offspring from one hundred mother animals. In the past, livestock epidemics often occurred in the Ordos grasslands every spring, causing some livestock losses; in the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, people's communes adopted the method of "fixed leadership, fixed herders, fixed targets" and launched a labor competition combining herders, lambing caretakers, and veterinary technicians, repeatedly reducing livestock losses and continuously increasing the survival rate of young animals. Currently, the survival rate of the more than 800,000 young animals delivered has reached over 95%, with two large livestock herds delivering 92 young animals from 91 mother animals, achieving a 100% survival rate. Herdsmen in the Hongguang Management Area of the Wulanhada People's Commune in the Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner created a "cold room breeding method" for winter lambs in the movement, reducing the lamb mortality rate to one in ten thousand.

In the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, various localities have also strengthened winter feeding and management of mother animals and breeding males based on years of experience that "three full meals a day for mother animals lead to two births a year; two full meals a day lead to one birth a year; and one full meal a day endangers life," adopting the method of "year-round mating for large livestock and rotational mating for small livestock," mating more than 300,000 mother animals throughout the winter. This large-scale "extra breeding" is unprecedented. These mother animals will breed and raise at least 260,000 to 270,000 more young animals this year than in previous years.

The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement. As soon as this movement emerged, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened a region-wide broadcast conference, calling on herdsmen to extensively and deeply carry out this movement. Subsequently, Party committees at all levels established special institutions to strengthen leadership, sending large numbers of cadres deep into the pastures to help herdsmen find solutions and measures. To help farmers and herdsmen improve their management level, more than 400,000 herders, lambing caretakers, and mating technicians were trained during the breeding improvement, body condition preservation, and lambing care stages. Hangjin Banner, which initially proposed the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, convened a series of on-site meetings from the banner Party committee to the commune Party committees and brigade branches, promptly conducting inspections and evaluations, establishing models, overcoming weak links, and inspiring herdsmen to become more high-spirited and confident. Currently, more than 180,000 young animals have been bred and raised from the more than 160,000 large and small mother animals produced in the banner, greatly exceeding the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" target. In the past, large-scale winter wells were rare on the grasslands. However, in the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, Party committees at all levels, in order to ensure that livestock had a good winter and spring, led herdsmen to skillfully overcome frozen soil layers, drilling more than 8,900 water wells in one winter, more than the number of wells drilled in the past year, thereby meeting the drinking water needs of another four to five million head of livestock, enabling livestock to maintain about 80% of their body condition even during the winter and spring seasons. According to the characteristics of cold winters and heavy wind and snow on the grasslands, many local Party organizations also launched small movements within the larger movement, mobilizing the masses to carry out the "safe livestock herd" movement. More than 4,000 "safe herds" have now emerged in the Hulunbuir, Xilingol, and Ordos grasslands. Many commune Party committees have also helped herdsmen establish livestock herd archives, further advancing the scientific management level of animal husbandry. (Attached picture)

    内蒙古畜牧业开展“百母百仔”运动
    全区发展了“丰产群”“试验群”经验，半年内繁殖四百七十万头仔畜
    本报呼和浩特16日电　内蒙古畜牧业“百母百仔”运动，已在草原和农村广泛展开，并且取得了显著的成绩。
    内蒙古畜牧业的“百母百仔”运动，是在大跃进中涌现的大批“丰产群”和“试验群”的基础上发展起来的。各族牧民和农民，为了使每百头母畜一年繁殖成活一百头仔畜，从去年11月就掀起这个运动。到目前止，全区已经接下四百七十万头仔畜（其中有十八万多头是大家畜幼畜），比去年同期增加了一百八十万头左右，幼畜成活率都在93％以上。在这批新生的幼畜中，有七十六万多头是改良幼畜，数量也比去年增加了。现在，大规模的春季接羔已经开始，全区还有更多的母畜将要继续产仔。
    由于“百母百仔”运动的开展，牲畜繁殖成活率迅速提高。而且这种提高，已经不仅限于减少牲畜损失或提高仔畜成活率，而是从大家畜到小牲畜、从数量到质量，包括有计划地变大畜一年一产为随产随配，变小畜一年一产为一年两产和一母多羔的全面提高。这便保证了整个畜牧业生产的持续跃进。由于人民公社突出地抓了母畜满怀和改良工作，目前全区已产仔或怀胎的大家畜母畜，比去年同期增加了十多万头，其中改良母畜增加了五倍；已经产羔或怀胎的母羊，也比去年同期多百万多头，其中改良绵羊比去年同期多六十万头以上。在这一运动中，广大牧民和农民在各级党委领导下，依靠公社力量，不断加强了牲畜饲养管理，全区又出现了三千九百多个“大面积丰产群”。这些丰产群，都是百母产仔一百头以上。过去，鄂尔多斯草原上每到春季，就要发生畜疫，损失一些牲畜；在“百母百仔”运动中，各人民公社采取“定领导、定牧工、定指标”的办法，开展了放牧饲养员、接羔保育员和兽医技术员“三结合”的劳动竞赛，牲畜损失一再减少，仔畜成活率一跃再跃，目前接产的八十多万头仔畜成活率已达到95％以上，其中两个大畜群的九十一头母畜，生了九十二头仔畜，成活率达100％。察哈尔右翼后旗乌兰哈达人民公社红光管理区牧民，在运动中创造了一种冬季羔羊“冷室培育法”，把羔羊的死亡率降低到万分之一。
    各地在“百母百仔”运动中，还根据多年来母畜“一天三饱，一年两产；一天两饱，一年一产；一天一饱，生命难保”的经验，加强了产仔母畜和种公畜的冬季饲养管理，采取“大畜常年配，小畜轮茬配”的办法，一冬天就配了三十多万头母畜。这种大规模的“额外繁殖”，是前所未有的。这批母畜今年至少要比往年多繁殖成活二十六、七万头仔畜。
    党的领导是“百母百仔”运动取得巨大成绩的根本保证。这个运动刚一露头，中共内蒙古自治区委员会就立即召开全区广播大会，号召牧民广泛深入地开展这个运动。接着各级党委成立专门机构，加强领导，派出大批干部深入牧场，帮助牧民想办法找措施。为了帮助农牧民提高经营管理水平，在配种改良、保膘保胎、接羔保育等环节时期，训练了四十多万名放牧饲养员、接羔保育员和配种技术员。首倡“百母百仔”运动的杭锦旗，从旗委到公社党委和大队支部，在运动中先后召开了一系列现场会，及时检查评比，树立标兵，克服了薄弱环节，广大牧民更加斗志昂扬，信心百倍。现在全旗生产的十六万多头大小母畜，已经繁殖成活了十八万多头仔畜，大大超过了“百母百仔”。过去，草原上大规模打冬井是少见的事。但在“百母百仔”运动中，各级党委为了让牲畜过一个好冬春，领导牧民巧攻冻土层，一冬天打了八千九百多眼水井，比过去一年打的井还多，从而又满足了四、五百万头牲畜的饮水，使畜膘冬春季节仍然保持在八成左右。根据草原冬季寒冷、风雪大的特点，许多地方的党组织，还在大运动里套小运动，发动群众开展“安全畜群”运动。呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒和鄂尔多斯等草原上，现在已经出现了四千多个“安全群”。许多公社党委还帮助牧民建立了畜群档案，使畜牧业管理水平进一步走向了科学化。（附图片）
