Xinhua News Agency, April 4th (TASS dispatch, April 4th): A mass rally was held on April 4th at the Lenin Central Stadium Sports Palace in Moscow to welcome the return of Soviet government head Khrushchev from his visit to France.

More than fifteen thousand representatives of the working people of Moscow and its suburbs greeted Khrushchev and Soviet government leaders with warm applause.

Khrushchev spoke at the meeting. He said that his visit to France "went very well."

Khrushchev believed that the negotiations and talks he held with General de Gaulle were "very serious and very beneficial."

Khrushchev emphasized that the detailed exchange of views showed that "on most issues, our understanding is extremely close."

He said that on the issue of disarmament, "our position with General de Gaulle, I would say, is consistent."

Khrushchev said, I think that the French President and the French government now know and understand the Soviet Union's position on the German question very well, and we have also gained a more concrete understanding of the French position on this issue.

Khrushchev said that there should be no delay in seeking a solution to the German question, a solution that accords with the interests of all peoples.

Khrushchev considered Chancellor Adenauer's position to be "extremely dangerous." Adenauer, during his visits to the United States and Japan, attempted to mobilize supporters of the "Cold War" and bring them together to obstruct an agreement on the conclusion of a German peace treaty.

The head of the Soviet government said that we will do our best to solve the problem of the German peace treaty on a basis acceptable to Western countries.

Khrushchev pointed out that it was confirmed during the talks and meetings with General de Gaulle that "there is a basis for formulating a mutually agreed position between our two countries on many major international issues."

Khrushchev said that if the Soviet Union and France "work together with all other countries that uphold peace, then an insurmountable obstacle can be created to stop new aggression and new wars in Europe."

Khrushchev considered the following statement to be nonsense: that someone said that the Soviet Union wanted to make France quarrel with West Germany, wanting to instigate the French people against the Germans.

He said that if the Soviet Union, France, and the two Germanys get along with each other in friendship, then any soil for unrest in Europe will be eliminated.

Khrushchev confirmed that, as the exchange of views showed, France and the Soviet Union have a strong interest in developing economic and cultural ties.

The head of the Soviet government emphasized the warm and sincere feelings of the French people towards the representatives of the Soviet people.

He also pointed out that there is still a faction within France that is frantically resisting the French people's desire for peace, but the voices of these people are drowned out by the common feelings of ordinary French people for friendship between the Soviet and French peoples and for the establishment of world peace.

Khrushchev said that his meetings and talks with President de Gaulle in Paris and Rambouillet were open, warm, and friendly.

The head of the Soviet government emphasized that "General de Gaulle's visit to the Soviet Union will make it possible to continue our meetings and talks."

Khrushchev said that his visit to France and his negotiations with General de Gaulle will help the heads of government of the four major powers to formulate common views on extremely important international issues during the summit meeting to be held in Paris on May 16.

    莫斯科群众集会欢迎赫鲁晓夫归来
    赫鲁晓夫强调法国人民对苏联人民的真诚感情
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社4日讯：4日在莫斯科列宁中央运动场体育宫为苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫访法归来举行了群众大会。
    莫斯科市和近郊一万五千多名劳动人民的代表以热烈的掌声欢迎赫鲁晓夫和苏联政府领导人。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。他说，他的访法“进行得十分顺利。”
    赫鲁晓夫认为他同戴高乐将军举行的谈判和会谈，是“很认真的，十分有益的。”
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，详细交换意见的结果表明，“在大多数问题上，我们的理解是极其接近的。”
    他说，在裁军问题上，“我们同戴高乐将军的立场，我要说，是相吻合的。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，我觉得，现在法国总统和法国政府很好地知道和理解苏联在德国问题上的立场，而我们对于法国方面在这个问题上的立场也获得了比较具体的概念。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在寻求解决德国问题方面不容迟缓，这种解决要符合各国人民的利益。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，阿登纳总理的立场是“极其危险的”，阿登纳在访问美国和日本期间企图动员“冷战”的拥护者，纠合他们来阻挠就缔结对德和约达成协议。
    苏联政府首脑说，我们将尽力在对西方国家也可以接受的基础上解决对德和约问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在同戴高乐将军会谈和会晤的过程中确认，“在许多重大国际问题上拟订出我们两国之间大家一致同意的立场，是有基础的。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果苏联和法国“同其他维护和平的一切国家共同努力的话，那末就可以造成一个不可克服的障碍来阻挡在欧洲的新侵略和新战争。”
    赫鲁晓夫认为下面这种说法是无稽之谈，即有人说什么苏联想使法国同西德争吵起来，想唆使法国人反对德国人。
    他说，如果苏联、法国和两个德国彼此友好相处，那末在欧洲就会消除任何不安的土壤。
    赫鲁晓夫确认，如交换意见所表明，法国和苏联对发展经济文化联系有浓厚的兴趣。
    苏联政府首脑强调指出法国人对苏联人民代表的热烈真诚的感情。
    他还指出，在法国内部还有一派势力猖狂地对抗法国人民的和平愿望，但是，在法国普通人对苏法两国人民友谊、对建立世界和平的共同感情中，这些人的声音被淹没了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他同戴高乐总统在巴黎和朗布依埃的会晤和会谈，是开诚公布的、热烈的和友好的。
    苏联政府首脑强调指出，“戴高乐将军的访问苏联将使得有可能继续我们的会晤和会谈。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，他的访法和同戴高乐将军的谈判，将有助于在5月16日在巴黎举行的最高级会晤期间四大国政府首脑就极重要的国际问题拟定出共同的观点。
