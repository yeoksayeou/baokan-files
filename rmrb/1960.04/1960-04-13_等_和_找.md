    “Waiting” and “Searching”	Liǔ Dí
    The service personnel of the "Living Service Station" on Guangfu Road in Tianjin are busy all day long, unstintingly taking apart and washing, sewing and mending, cleaning houses, and buying things on behalf of the residents. They answer every question and fulfill every request. It is not enough that they are busy at the service station; they also proactively "provide door-to-door service." They say, "Waiting for work to do, doing work when there is work, searching for work when there is no work, there is always a lot of work." They visit door-to-door everywhere, and as long as they encounter things that are beneficial to everyone, no matter how big or small, easy or difficult, they do it immediately to help others. Therefore, the masses call them the "omnipotent service station."
    This spirit of not being content with "waiting for work to do" but proactively "searching for work to do" can be seen everywhere. In Nanjing City's vigorous efforts to develop street industries, the broad masses of residents have promoted the revolutionary spirit of "everyone contributing when there is no capital, everyone giving up space when there is no housing, everyone searching for equipment when there is no equipment, and studying diligently when there is no technology." There is also a "searching" character in this. With this "searching," everything that was originally lacking has been found. In a short period of time, Nanjing City established hundreds and thousands of factories. The Dongfeng Machinery Factory of the Dingjiaqiao Office in Gulou District, started from scratch by five housewives, and has now become a hardware factory with more than 300 employees, more than 30 machine tool equipment, and can produce more than ten kinds of products such as various types of pliers and alloy needles. They said:
      "Visited large factories everywhere to search, looked for treasures in scrap piles,
      Three pairs of pliers and four files, determined to build a lathe,
      The bed surface is not level, dragged on the road, the file is not good, grinded by hand,
      Riding the east wind to have great ambitions, the phoenix comes from a small chicken coop." From nothing to something, from small to large, from no technology to technology, from no experience to experience, "searching" has exerted such a huge force!
    "Waiting for work to do" and "searching for work to do" reflect two different attitudes towards work.
    The so-called "waiting for work to do" means doing as much work as is assigned, doing whatever comes along, not refusing to do less, and not asking to do more; if there is no experience, wait for experience; if there is no solution, wait for a solution. This attitude of "waiting" is rarely seen today, because it is incompatible with the style of our era. What has replaced it is the spirit of "searching for work to do." This is a positive and proactive revolutionary spirit, a spirit of courageously advancing and constantly making revolution. This spirit is based on a high degree of political and ideological awareness, and on an infinite love for the revolutionary cause and the collective interest. With this spirit, people will generate conscious revolutionary action, and no matter what they do, they cannot sit down and "wait" with peace of mind, but cannot help but stand up and "search." If there is nothing to do, search for things to do; if there are few things to do, search for more things to do; if there is no solution, search for solutions; if there is no experience, search for experience; if there are no conditions, create conditions; all things that are not available or lacking must be found.
    Where to search? Search in the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory, search in Chairman Mao's works, search in practice, search among the masses, search in all directions, search in all places where you can find.
    How to search? Search with enthusiasm, search with full confidence, search tenaciously and bravely, and search in every possible way like the service personnel of Guangfu Road in Tianjin and the housewives of Dingjiaqiao in Nanjing. Say "search," act immediately, and don't give up until you find it. In this way, we will surely be able to do more things for the people, and we will surely be able to do things quickly and well.
    Any good thing must be created by people's efforts, and waiting will not bring it. Can socialism fall from the sky? No. Can the "poor and blank" state of affairs change by itself? No. Can street industries be born by themselves? No, no. In the ancient Chinese fable, the person who "waited for a rabbit by the stump" suffered from "waiting." The harm of "waiting" lies in being passive, and the value of "searching" lies in being active. To do anything, as long as you have this initiative, you will do better and better, and it will be easier and easier to do; no matter what difficulties, once you encounter initiative, they will become paper tigers; no matter what problems, once you search, you will find the key to solving the problem. The question is whether there is the great ambition to constantly make revolution, and whether there is the revolutionary courage and perseverance to dare to "search." The service personnel of Guangfu Road in Tianjin search door-to-door to serve the residents, so they have formed a new moral fashion of everyone for me, me for everyone, giving convenience to others, and leaving difficulties to themselves; the residents of Dingjiaqiao in Nanjing search everywhere for ways to run factories, so there has been a blossoming of street industries. People are the most decisive factor in social productive forces. In my country's socialist construction cause, as long as people give full play to their subjective initiative and promote an active and proactive revolutionary spirit, all our undertakings will rapidly show more beautiful scenery.

### “等”和“找”

    “等”和“找”	柳笛
    天津光复道“生活服务站”的服务员们，一天到晚辛勤地为居民拆拆洗洗、缝缝补补、打扫房屋、代买东西，简直有问必答，有求必应。她们在服务站上忙个不停还不算，还要主动地“服务上门”。说是“等事做，没事做，找事做，事很多。”她们到处登门造访，只要遇见对大家有益的事情，不管大小和难易，动手就做，帮助别人。因此，群众称她们是“万能服务站”。
    这种不甘于“等事做”，而要主动地“找事做”的精神，到处都可以看到。南京市在大办街道工业中，广大的居民群众发扬了“没有资金大家凑，没有房子大家让，没有设备大家找，没有技术刻苦学”的革命精神，其中也有个“找”字。这一“找”，原来没有的东西都找来了。在短短的时间内，南京市办起了千百个工厂。鼓楼区丁家桥办事处东风机械厂，由五个家庭妇女白手起家，现在已经成为一个有三百多职工、三十多台机床设备、能够生产各种型号的老虎钳、合金针等十多种产品的五金厂了。她们这样说：
      “遍访大厂四处找，废料堆里来寻宝，
      三把钳子四把锉，决心要把车床造，
      床面不平路上拖，锉子不行用手磨，
      乘着东风鼓大志，凤凰出自小鸡窝。”从无到有、从小到大，从没有技术到有技术，从没有经验到有经验，“找”，竟然发挥了如此巨大的力量！
    “等事做”和“找事做”，反映着对待工作两种不同的态度。
    所谓“等事做”，就是分配多少工作就做多少工作，来了什么事情就做什么事情，虽不拒绝少做，也不要求多做；没有经验，等经验，没有办法，等办法。这种“等”的态度，今天早已经很少见了，因为它和我们这个时代的风格不相称。起而代之的，是“找事做”的精神。这是一种积极主动的革命精神，是一种勇往直前，不断革命的精神。这种精神建立在高度的政治思想觉悟的基础上，建立在对革命事业对集体利益无限热爱的基础上。人们有了这种精神，就产生了自觉的革命行动，不管做任何事情，就怎么也不能心安理得地坐下来“等”，而是情不自禁地站起来去“找”。没事就找事做，事情少就去找更多事情，没有办法就找办法，没有经验就找经验，没有条件就创造条件，凡是没有的和缺少的东西都要把它找来。
    到哪里去找？到马克思列宁主义理论的宝库中去找，到毛主席的著作中去找，到实践中去找，到群众中去找，到四处八方去找，所有可以找到的地方都去找。
    怎样找？要满怀热情地去找，信心百倍地去找，顽强勇敢地去找，要像天津光复道的服务员和南京丁家桥的家庭妇女们那样千方百计地去找。说一声“找”，立即行动，不找到手，就不罢休。这样，就一定可以为人民做更多的事情，就一定能够把事情办得又快又好。
    任何美好的东西，都要靠着人们的努力去创造，等，是等不来的。社会主义能从天而降吗？不能；“一穷二白”的面貌能自己改变吗？不能；街道工业能自己诞生吗？不能，不能。我国古代寓言故事中，那个“守株待兔”的人，就是吃了“等”的亏。“等”的害处在于被动，“找”的可贵在于主动。办任何事情，只要有了这种主动精神，就会越办越好，越办越好办；不管什么困难，一遇到主动精神，就变成了纸老虎；不管任何问题，一找，就会找到解决问题的钥匙。问题就在于有没有不断革命的雄心大志，有没有勇于“找”的革命胆略和毅力。天津光复道的服务员们找上门去为居民服务，所以形成了我为人人，人人为我，把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己的新的道德风尚；南京丁家桥的居民们四处找办法办工厂，所以出现了百花盛开的街道工业。人是社会生产力中最有决定性的因素，在我国的社会主义建设事业中，只要人们充分发挥主观能动作用，发扬积极主动的革命精神，我们的一切事业都会迅速出现更加美好的景色。
