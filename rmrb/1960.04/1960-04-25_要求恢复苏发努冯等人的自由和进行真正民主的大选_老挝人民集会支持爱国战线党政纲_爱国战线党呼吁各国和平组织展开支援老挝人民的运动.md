Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 23rd: According to the "Lao Patriotic News" report on April 17th, in the first three months of this year, over 82,000 people in various parts of Laos held rallies and passed thousands of resolutions, resolutely opposing the "sweeping" and suppression policies implemented by the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. They demanded the release of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, improvements in the people's livelihoods, and genuinely free and democratic elections.

Many rallies passed resolutions addressed to the Lao Patriotic Front, warmly supporting the Lao Patriotic Front's political program for elections and expressing firm confidence in the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Patriotic monks in many parts of Xieng Khouang Province also submitted suggestions to the King and government of Laos, protesting the attempts by the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" to sell out Laos to U.S. imperialism, continue to expand the civil war, and conduct "sweeping" operations and persecute the people. The same day, "Lao Patriotic News" also reported that on March 15th, a unit of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces, in coordination with guerrillas, liberated the Na Rao concentration camp established by the Lao Royal Army in Vientiane Province during an anti-"sweeping" operation. This concentration camp was where the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" forcibly concentrated residents from five villages in the Bolikhamxay District of Vientiane Province during "sweeping" operations earlier this year.

In this battle, the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces and guerrillas killed ten soldiers of the Royal Army, seized a batch of American weapons, recovered a large amount of grain and property looted from the people by the Royal Army during the "sweeping" operations, and liberated the people who were imprisoned in the concentration camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 22nd: "Lao Patriotic News" published a letter from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front to the Chairman of the Presidium of the World Peace Council on April 2nd. This letter suggested that the World Peace Council and peace organizations in various countries launch a movement to support the Lao people's struggle for peace and national harmony.

The letter stated that currently, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," are intensifying their suppression and persecution of the Lao people, attempting to hold elections under the bayonets, so as to establish a National Assembly that conforms to their intentions, a tool for implementing U.S. imperialism's war policy.

The letter stated that, in line with its commitment to a policy of peace and neutrality and the spirit of national harmony, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently wrote to the Lao Royal Government, suggesting that the Royal Army cease "sweeping" operations, stop persecuting the people, and that both sides hold meetings to consult, allowing the Lao people to freely vote and elect a parliament that conforms to the Lao Constitution, the Geneva Agreements, and the Vientiane Agreements.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front hopes that this suggestion will receive widespread support from peace-defending organizations in various countries.

According to "Lao Patriotic News" on April 13th, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front wrote to various Lao parties and prominent figures. This letter expressed the hope that parties and individuals concerned about the interests of Laos can support the Lao Patriotic Front's peace proposals and urge the Royal Government to accept the ceasefire proposal so that the election can be carried out well, thereby creating conditions for the country to return to normal and implement a policy of peace and neutrality based on the Geneva Agreements and Vientiane Agreements.

According to "Lao Patriotic News" on April 15th, all officers and soldiers of the Second Battalion of the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces wrote a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Lao Royal Government Army on March 30th, calling on them to support the peace proposals put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front to the Royal Government.

The letter pointed out that the civil war provoked by U.S. imperialism and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" is of no benefit to the motherland, but only benefits those who launched the civil war.

The letter pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front's proposals create conditions for resolving the current situation, completely stopping the civil war, and promoting harmony among all Lao ethnic groups and peaceful life for the people.

    川圹省许多地方的爱国僧侣也向老挝国王和政府提出建议书，抗议“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们企图把老挝出卖给美帝国主义，继续扩大内战，进行“扫荡”和迫害人民。同一天的“老挝爱国新闻”还报道，3月15日，前寮国战斗部队一个单位在反“扫荡”中，在游击队的配合下解放了老挝王国军队在万象省设立的纳绕集中营。这个集中营是“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们今年初在进行“扫荡”的时候把万象省波里坎区五个乡的居民强迫集中起来的地方。
  前寮国战斗部队和游击队在这一战斗中打死王国军队十名，缴获了一批美国武器，收回了人民在“扫荡”中被王国军队掠去的大量粮食和财物，解放了被关在集中营里的人民。

    信中写道，目前，美帝国主义及其走狗老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们正在变本加厉地镇压、迫害老挝人民，企图在刺刀下进行大选，以便成立一个符合他们意图的国民议会，一个为实现美帝国主义的战争政策的工具。
    信中说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会本着忠于和平中立政策和民族和睦精神，最近写信给老挝王国政府，建议王国军队停止“扫荡”、停止迫害人民、双方举行会晤，以便进行协商，让老挝人民自由地投票，选出一个符合老挝宪法、符合日内瓦协议和万象协议的国会。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会希望这个建议能够获得各国保卫和平组织的广泛支持。
    “老挝爱国新闻”4月13日发表老挝爱国战线党中央委员会写给老挝各党派和著名人士的信。这封信表示希望关心老挝国家利益的各党派和人士能够支持老挝爱国战线党的和平建议，并促使王国政府接受停火建议，以使大选能够良好地进行，从而创造条件，使国家恢复正常局势，并在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上执行和平中立政策。
