Promote the Spirit of Great Collaboration and Vigorously Develop "One-Dragon" Transportation
Representative Tan Zhen Talks About "One-Dragon" Production-Transportation-Sales

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on the struggle to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will only make a brief speech on some situations of vigorously developing the "one-dragon" transportation and great collaboration on the transportation front.

The "one-dragon" production-transportation-sales and great transportation collaboration is a fruitful result of the Party's general line for socialist construction on the transportation front. After the rectification movement in 1958, the vast number of workers at the Qinhuangdao Railway and Port greatly improved their ideological awareness, established an overall ideology of mutual trust, mutual disclosure, unity and cooperation, and a family of road and port; on the basis of learning from the advanced collaborative experiences of Fuxin Road and Mine, Benxi Road and Factory, etc., under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, they organized factories, mines, stations, ports, trains, ships, receiving departments, etc., and vigorously carried out communist collaboration, so that the entire transportation process from loading at mines and factories to unloading at receiving departments formed a transportation line that was connected in a line, closely linked, and continuously running through the entire land and water route -- which the masses called "one-dragon transportation great collaboration." Once this revolutionary experience appeared, it spread rapidly and widely throughout the country, and quickly formed a broad mass movement. Hebei Province has formed about 8,000 collaborative transportation lines, Sichuan Province has organized 12,000 dragons, and many provinces such as Fujian, Jiangxi, and Liaoning have also formed thousands of dragons, moving towards the goal of "thousands of dragons per district, ten thousand dragons per province." In addition to vigorously organizing intra-provincial (district) dragon networks, Guangdong and Guangxi also jointly formed the Xijiang transportation "one-dragon." Thousands of dragons are intertwined into a network, connecting many factories, mines, forest areas, and people's communes across the country, forming a scene of群龙飞舞,争相跃进 [a multitude of dragons flying, competing to leap forward]. The form and content of "dragon" are also constantly developing, roughly with the following types:

    1.  "Long dragons" with railway transportation, water transportation, or land-water trunk line combined transportation as the backbone. For example, Qinhuangdao's "factory, mine, railway, port, ship, cargo owner" one-dragon, northern coastal and Yangtze River long and short-distance water dragons, and river-sea-river combined transportation dragons. After these "dragons" were organized, they greatly improved transportation efficiency and accelerated the circulation of materials. For example, the department store dragon that is shipped from Shanghai to Qiqihar via Qinhuangdao for northbound transport, achieves direct transfer between trains and ships at the port, with goods not touching the ground, shortening the entire land and water journey from 25 days to 7 days, increasing efficiency by more than two times.

    2.  Local short-distance transportation "one-dragon" with highway trunk lines as the backbone and material distribution centers as the center. For example, the production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration in Changli County, they united railway, highway, handling, industrial, commercial, grain departments, and the county economic planning committee, handicraft industry bureau, bank and other nine units, and implemented unified thinking, unified planning, unified distribution of materials, unified dispatching, unified use of cargo spaces, unified consignment and delivery, unified settlement, unified competition indicators, and unified inspection and reporting. The shipping and receiving departments only need to make a shipping plan once a month, and settle it once through the bank, to achieve "picking up goods at the door and delivering goods to the home." Fushan and other four people's communes in Zhangjiakou area of Hebei Province and Chicheng and other nine people's communes in Longguan County broke down the boundaries of communes, united, and vigorously carried out production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration between communes, unified arrangement of cargo flow, rational dispatching of various transportation tools, widely carried out relay transportation, reversed the long-term backlog of materials, promoted production development, improved people's lives, and further improved the communist awareness of the broad masses.

    3.  Through the collaboration office, organize the comprehensive utilization of various transportation tools in a region, share railway special lines, and organize automobile collaboration groups for organs and enterprises. After the Xujiazhuang People's Commune in Shijiazhuang area organized the collaboration office, it organized cyclical transportation in a planned way, achieving no empty vehicles, no backlog of goods, completing the commune's transportation tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, and also promoted the development of the commune's economy and promoted the commune's transportation construction. After the Hebei District of Tianjin organized the automobile collaboration group for organs and enterprises, the completed transport volume increased sharply by three times. The collaboration office is not only an organizational mechanism for strengthening regular transportation collaboration, but also, when transportation is particularly tight, it can, according to the instructions of the Party committee, after consultation, uniformly allocate local transportation capacity and manpower, and create favorable conditions for organizing temporary surprise transportation.

    4.  "Small dragon groups" for internal factory transportation. It closely collaborates between the various links of transportation inside the factory and mine, and between transportation and production departments, from raw materials and fuel entering the factory, through the production process to the products leaving the factory, forming a linked and flowing assembly line from beginning to end, and connecting with external factory transportation, becoming the龙头 [dragon head] or 龙尾 [dragon tail] of the trunk line "one-dragon." For example, under the leadership of the Party organization, Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory vigorously developed internal factory transportation and vigorously carried out transportation collaboration inside and outside the factory, fundamentally changing the long-term situation of machines not being fully utilized, and rapidly increasing output by about one-third.

From the above types of "dragons," it can be seen that the production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration is a revolution in transportation organization, a product of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, a new development in the mass movement on the transportation front over the years, and a new form of all-Party and all-people running transportation. The "one-dragon" of production-transportation-sales fully embodies the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Under the glorious light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and exerted soaring revolutionary vigor, resulting in a sustained Great Leap Forward in the entire national economy. The rapid development of the industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors requires a corresponding rapid development of transportation productive forces. Thus, in addition to accelerating the construction of new transportation equipment and reforming existing equipment, it is even more urgent to greatly improve the transportation capacity of existing equipment. This requires appropriately adjusting the relationship between various departments in the transportation process and revising regulations that cannot adapt to the further development of transportation capacity. In this situation, the production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration emerged as the times require. The generation process of the "one-dragon" fully proves that under the socialist system, it is necessary to constantly and rationally resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, continuous reforms are carried out to the relations of production and the superstructure to open up broad roads for the continuous development of productive forces.

The one-dragon transportation collaboration is a product of the greatly improved communist awareness of the broad masses, and its development further promotes the further improvement of the communist awareness of the broad masses. After the education of practice, the truth that "collaboration is strength" is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and everyone regards collaboration as glorious and regards localism as shameful. The communist style of putting others before oneself and selflessness has become a conscious action of the masses. This commune actively helps that commune to repair roads; railway workers load and unload for automobiles and horse-drawn carriages regardless of remuneration, while automobile workers propose to rather let the car stop for a minute than let the train stop for a second, and horse-drawn carriage workers propose to rather let the horse-drawn carriage stop for a minute than let the car stop for a second. Moving stories like this emerge in an endless stream.

The emergence of the production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration further guarantees the high-speed and proportionate development of transportation and other sectors of the national economy. By organizing one-dragon transportation lines, the relationship between industry, agriculture, commerce and transportation departments is further deepened. The "several unifications" and "several combinations" implemented in various places closely link departments and industries together. In particular, like the Qinhuangdao road and port, on the basis of comprehensive unification of production operations, it has also developed into the unification of militia organizations, the unification of cultural and sports organizations, and the unification of welfare facilities, embarking on the road of integrating all aspects of production and life. This foreshadows that in the entire process from production to consumption, the production-transportation-sales departments will gradually coalesce into a whole, and further exert the superiority of socialist ownership by the whole people.

The generation and smooth development of the one-dragon transportation great collaboration demonstrates the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. He taught us to adhere to putting politics in command and using politics to guide the economic work; correctly understand the dialectical relationship between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between superstructure and the economic base, consciously adjust the relations of production and the superstructure to continuously improve; under the premise of respecting the role of objective laws, fully exert the subjective initiative of people, mobilize all positive factors, exert the spirit of continuous revolution, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. The production-transportation-sales one-dragon transportation great collaboration is a brilliant flower blooming under the cultivation of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades! The boiling scene of the Great Steelmaking Campaign in 1958 is again unfolding before our eyes. After the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, the thinking of the masses has been further liberated, the communist awareness of the broad masses has been continuously improved, and the spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. Everywhere is filled with the communist style of "taking on difficulties when you see them, giving way to honors when you see them, learning from the advanced when you see them, and helping the backward when you see them." The rural people's communes have further exerted their superiority, mobilizing the enthusiasm of 500 million peasants to march towards the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture, and people's communes are now being enthusiastically established in cities, which will liberate thousands of women and become a strong force in social production. The great wave of technical revolution and cultural revolution is vigorously changing the backward face of our country of "poverty and blankness." "Everyone is busy with production, everywhere there is innovation," a thriving scene, foreshadowing that this year the national economy will continue to leap forward at a higher speed and more comprehensively, showing the prospects of continuous leap forward development of our country's socialist construction cause throughout the 1960s. Comrades, let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the direction pointed out by the Party's general line, and strive to achieve the third year of the Leap Forward.

    大兴协作之风　大搞“一条龙”运输
    谭真代表谈产运销“一条龙”主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理关于1960年度国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要而斗争的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。现在我仅就交通运输战线上大搞产运销一条龙运输大协作的一些情况，作一个简单的发言。
    产运销一条龙运输大协作是党的社会主义建设总路线在交通运输战线上结出的硕果。秦皇岛铁路和港口广大职工，经过1958年的整风运动，思想觉悟大大提高，建立了互相信任，互相交底，团结协作，路港一家的整体思想；在学习阜新路矿，本溪路厂等先进的协作经验的基础上，在当地党委统一领导下，把厂矿、车站、港口、火车、船舶、收货等部门组织起来，大搞共产主义协作，使从矿山工厂装车一直到收货部门卸车的整个运输过程，形成一条一线相连、环环紧扣、水陆全程连续不断的运输线——群众称之为“一条龙运输大协作”。这个具有革命意义的经验一经出现，就在全国各地迅速传播推广起来，很快地形成了一个广泛的群众运动。河北省已组成约八千条协作运输线，四川省组织了一万二千条龙，福建、江西、辽宁等许多省也都组成了成千条龙，正向着“千龙专区，万龙省”的目标迈进。广东、广西除了大力组织省（区）内的龙网外，还共同组成西江运输一条龙。千千万万条龙交织成网，把全国许多的工厂、矿山、林区、人民公社联系起来，形成了群龙飞舞，争相跃进的局面。“龙”的形式和内容也不断发展，大体上有以下几种类型：
    一、以铁路运输、水上运输或水陆干线联运为骨干的“长龙”。例如秦皇岛的“厂矿、铁路、港口、船舶、货主”一条龙，北方沿海和长江的长短途水龙和江海河联运龙。这些“龙”组织起来以后，大大提高了运输效率，加速了物资流转。例如从上海经秦皇岛中转到齐齐哈尔北运的百货龙，在港口换装时做到车船对口、货不落地，水陆全程由过去二十五天缩短到七天，提高效率两倍以上。
    二、以公路干线为骨干，以物资集散点为中心的地方短途运输一条龙。例如昌黎县的产运销一条龙运输大协作，他们把铁路、公路、搬运、工业、商业、粮食部门和县经济计划委员会、手工业局、银行等九个单位联合起来，实行了统一思想、统一计划、统一分配物资、统一调度、统一使用货位、统一托运和交付、统一结算、统一竞赛指标、统一检查和汇报。收发货部门每月只要做一次托运计划，通过银行一次结算，就可以“取货上门，送货到家”。河北省张家口地区矾山等四个人民公社和龙关县赤城等九个人民公社，打破了社界，联合起来，大搞公社与公社之间的产运销一条龙运输大协作，统一安排货流，合理调度各种运输工具，广泛开展接力运输，扭转了长期以来物资积压的局面，促进了生产发展，改善了人民生活，并进一步提高了广大群众的共产主义觉悟。
    三、通过协作办公室，组织一个地区内各种运输工具的综合利用共用铁路专用线，组织机关企业汽车协作团。石家庄地区徐家庄人民公社组织协作办公室后，有计划地组织循环运输，做到车不空驶，货不积压，提前超额完成了公社运输任务，还促进了公社经济的发展，推动了公社交通建设。天津市河北区组织机关企业汽车协作团后，完成的运量猛增三倍。协作办公室不仅是加强经常的运输协作的组织机构，而且在运输特别紧张时，还可以根据党委的指示，经过协商，统一调配当地的运力、人力，对组织临时突击运输也创造了有利条件。
    四、厂内运输的“小龙群”。它使厂矿内部运输的各个环节之间，以及运输和生产各部门之间，密切协作，从原材料、燃料进厂，经过生产过程到产品出厂，形成一个首尾贯通的联动流水作业线，并与厂外运输相连结，成为干线一条龙的龙头或龙尾。例如天津市第一面粉厂在党组织的领导下，大办厂内运输，大搞厂内外运输协作以后，从根本上改变了长期以来机器吃不饱的情况，使产量迅速提高三分之一左右。
    从以上几种类型的“龙”可以看出，产运销一条龙运输大协作是运输组织工作上的革命，是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的产物，是历年来交通运输战线的群众运动的新发展，是全党全民办交通的新形式。产运销一条龙，充分体现了社会主义制度的无比优越性。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，广大群众破除了迷信，解放了思想，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，出现了整个国民经济的持续大跃进。工农商各部门的飞跃发展，要求运输生产力也有相应的飞跃发展。这样，除了加速建设新的和改革现有的运输设备外，更迫切的是，要大大地提高现有设备的运输能力。这就要求适当调整运输过程中各部门之间的关系，修改不能适应运输能力进一步发展的规章制度。在这样的形势下，产运销一条龙运输大协作应运而生。“一条龙”的产生过程，充分证明了在社会主义制度下，必须不断地合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾。根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，为生产力的不断发展开辟广阔的道路。
    一条龙运输协作是广大群众大大提高了共产主义觉悟的产物，它的发展又促使广大群众进一步提高共产主义觉悟。经过实践的教育，“协作就是力量”这一真理更加深入人心，大家都以协作为光荣，视本位主义为可耻。先人后己、舍己为人的共产主义风尚已成为群众自觉的行动。这一公社主动帮那一公社修路；铁路工人不计报酬为汽车马车装卸，而汽车工人提出宁肯让汽车停一分，不让火车停一秒，马车工人又提出宁肯让马车停一分，不让汽车停一秒。像这样动人的事迹层出不穷。
    产运销一条龙运输大协作的出现，进一步保证了运输与国民经济其他各部门高速度按比例地发展。通过组织一条龙运输线，更加密切了工农商和交通部门之间的关系。各地实行的“几统一”、“几合一”使部门与部门、行业与行业互相紧密地联结在一起。特别是像秦皇岛路、港在生产作业全面统一的基础上，又发展到民兵组织合一，文体组织合一，福利设施合一，走上了生产、生活等各方面都融成一体的道路。这预示了从生产到消费的全部过程中，产运销各部门将逐步凝成一个整体，更进一步发挥全民所有制的优越性。
    一条龙运输大协作的产生和顺利发展，说明了毛泽东思想的伟大力量。他教导我们要坚持政治挂帅，用政治来指导经济工作；正确认识生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础的辩证关系，自觉地调整生产关系和上层建筑使之不断完善；在尊重客观规律作用的前提下，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，调动一切积极因素，发挥不断革命的精神，多快好省地建设社会主义。产运销一条龙运输大协作就是在毛泽东思想的培育下开出的灿烂的花朵。
    同志们！1958年大炼钢铁时的沸腾景象又展现在我们眼前了。经过两年来的大跃进，更进一步解放了群众的思想，广大人民的共产主义觉悟不断提高，精神面貌起了深刻的变化。到处洋溢着“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的共产主义风尚。农村人民公社进一步发挥了它的优越性，调动五亿农民的积极性向着农业的机械化、水利化、电气化进军，城市里现在也热火朝天地办起人民公社，这又会有成千上万的家庭妇女解放出来，成为社会生产中一支强大的队伍。技术革命和文化革命的巨浪，正在有力地改变着我国“一穷二白”的落后面貌。“人人忙生产，处处有革新”，一片欣欣向荣的景色，预示今年国民经济将要以更高的速度、更全面地继续跃进，展示了在整个六十年代中我国社会主义建设事业不断地飞跃发展的前景。同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，紧紧地遵循党的总路线所指引的方向，为争取实现第三个跃进年而奋斗。
