West German Authorities Fully Expose Fascist Ugly Features
Fabricated Charges Lead to Imprisonment of Six Peaceful Warriors

(Reported by our newspaper) The illegal sentences handed down by the West German Düsseldorf court on April 8th against six West German peace activists once again exposed the sinister face of the West German ruling group in its hostility towards the relaxation of the international situation and its intensified suppression of the peaceful democratic movement.

On April 8th, the Düsseldorf court announced the sentencing of Diel, a member of the World Peace Council and a member of the West German Peace Committee, to one year in prison; Eckert, a member of the World Peace Council and chairman of the West German Peace Committee, to nine months in prison; Wollrath, a staff member of the West German Peace Committee, to six months in prison; Tieves, a staff member of the West German Peace Committee, to five months in prison; and Pastor Oberhof, a peace activist, to three months in prison (all with a five-year suspended sentence); and Kompalla, the secretary of the Rhineland-Palatinate Peace Committee of West Germany, was fined 500 marks. The court also announced the confiscation of many documents of the Peace Committee.

The persecution of the peace movement is a link in the West German authorities' policy of atomic armament. With the acceleration of rearmament, the West German authorities' persecution of the peace movement has become increasingly blatant. As early as 1952, the West German authorities filed a "lawsuit" against the West German Peace Committee, but because they were afraid of being condemned in world public opinion and thoroughly exposing themselves, they did not dare to start the trial immediately. In March of last year, the West German police illegally sealed off the central office of the West German Peace Committee in Düsseldorf, and then in November, the state court in Düsseldorf began the unreasonable trial of the six peace activists.

The trial of the leaders of the West German peace movement lasted for five months, with a total of fifty-six sessions. The entire trial process clearly showed that the charges imposed on these peace activists by the West German procuratorial and judicial authorities were all fabricated slanders. Therefore, some plaintiff "witnesses" simply refused to appear in court to testify. Even when "witnesses" did appear, they often did not know what they were talking about in court, resulting in the prosecutor being embarrassed on the spot. The prosecutors were also exposed more than once for forging "evidence" and colluding with agents of the West German intelligence agency "Constitutional Protection Bureau," who appeared as "witnesses," in an attempt to frame the peace activists. Even the judge presiding over the trial personally came forward to fabricate charges by constantly raising questions such as receiving "subsidies" from the Communist Party and being "manipulated" by the Communist Party.

From the beginning of the trial, the court has consistently become a forum for peace activists to denounce West German militarists, and the West German ruling authorities have turned from plaintiffs into defendants. The peace activists thoroughly exposed and condemned the Bonn authorities' conspiracy to accelerate atomic armament, implement fascist rule, and obstruct the relaxation of the international situation under the connivance of the United States. They solemnly refuted all the slanders against them and solemnly declared the righteousness of their struggle for peace and their determination to persist in this struggle.

The peace activists on trial, their defense lawyers, and witnesses sharply contrasted the rampant Nazi activities in West Germany today with the persecution of peace activists. They specifically pointed out that Oberländer, a notorious Nazi whose hands were stained with the blood of innocent people, is now a minister in the Bonn government, while Eckert, who participated in the Communist Party in the past and waged a resolute struggle against the Nazi Party, is now in the defendant's dock; Wollrath, who participated in the war to defend the Spanish Republican system, is being tried, while Bonn Defense Minister Strauss is secretly colluding with Franco, the executioner who strangled the Spanish Republican system, and wants to establish a West German military base in Spain.

During the trial, the West German and world public gave widespread support and assistance to these peace activists. On March 22, the seven peace activists (including the six on trial, and another whose trial was postponed due to illness) were awarded the gold and silver Peace Medals of the World Peace Council. The West German and world public continuously held rallies and demonstrations to protest the West German authorities' unreasonable trial. In Britain, France, Finland, Sweden, India, Japan, and some South American countries, the masses went to the West German embassies and consulates stationed in these countries to express their protests. Telegrams and letters protesting the trial poured in from all over the world, and many countries also sent delegations to Düsseldorf to attend the trial and express their solidarity with the peace activists. Some well-known international peace activists personally went to court as witnesses to defend the peace activists, denouncing the West German authorities' despicable conspiracy to persecute the peace movement.

### 西德当局法西斯丑态毕露  捏造罪状判处六名和平战士徒刑

    西德当局法西斯丑态毕露
    捏造罪状判处六名和平战士徒刑
    本报讯　西德杜塞尔多夫法庭8日对西德六个和平战士的非法判决，又一次暴露了西德统治集团敌视国际局势缓和和加紧镇压和平民主运动的狰狞面目。
    杜塞尔多夫的法庭8日宣布判处世界和平理事会理事、西德和平委员会委员迪尔一年徒刑，世界和平理事会理事、西德和平委员会主席艾克特九个月徒刑，西德和平委员会工作人员沃耳拉特六个月徒刑，西德和平委员会工作人员提费斯五个月徒刑，和平人士奥柏霍甫牧师三个月徒刑（俱缓刑五年）；西德来因兰—法尔茨州和平委员会书记康帕拉罚款五百马克。法庭还宣布没收和平委员会许多文件。
    迫害和平运动是西德当局推行原子武装政策的一个环节，随着加速重新武装的步伐，西德当局对和平运动的迫害已越来越赤裸裸了。早在1952年，西德当局就对西德和平委员会提出了“起诉”，但是由于害怕在世界舆论面前受到谴责和彻底暴露自己，还没有敢立即进行审讯。去年3月，西德警察先非法查封了杜塞尔多夫的西德和平委员会中央机构，接着就在11月由杜塞尔多夫的州法院开始了对六位和平战士的无理审讯。
    对西德和平运动领导人的这次审讯一共进行了五十六次，历时五个月之久。整个审讯的过程清楚地说明，西德检察机构和司法当局强加在这些和平战士头上的罪名，全是凭空捏造的诬陷。因此，有些原告“证人”根本拒绝出庭作证。即使有“证人”出庭，也常常在法庭上不知所云，结果使检察官当场出丑。检察官还不止一次地被揭发出，他们伪造“证据”，并且同以“证人”身份出现的西德间谍机构“宪法保卫局”的特务互相勾结，企图陷害和平战士。甚至主持审讯的法官也亲自出面，不断提出什么接受共产党“津贴”啦，什么受共产党“操纵”啦之类的问题，罗织罪状。
    从审讯一开始，法庭就一直成为和平战士控诉西德军国主义者的讲坛，西德统治当局从原告变成了被告。和平战士们彻底揭露和谴责了波恩当局在美国纵容下加速原子备战、实行法西斯统治和阻挠国际局势缓和的阴谋。他们严正地驳斥了对他们的一切诽谤，并且庄严地宣告他们为和平事业斗争的正义性和坚持这一斗争的决心。
  受审讯的和平战士、他们的辩护律师和证人在法庭上尖锐地对比了今天西德纳粹分子横行，而和平战士受迫害的情况。他们特别提出：双手沾满了善良人民的鲜血的恶名昭彰的纳粹分子奥勃兰德尔，今天是波恩政府的部长，而过去参加了共产党并且向纳粹党作坚决斗争的艾克特，今天却在法庭被告席上；参加过保卫西班牙共和制度的战争的沃耳拉特正在受审，而波恩国防部长施特劳斯却在同绞杀西班牙共和制度的刽子手佛朗哥秘密勾结，想在西班牙建立西德军事基地。
    审讯期间，西德和世界公众对这些和平战士给予了广泛的支持和支援。七个和平战士（其中受审讯的六人，另一人因病暂缓受审）在3月22日荣获世界和平理事会的金质和银质和平奖章。西德和世界各地公众，不断举行集会和示威，抗议西德当局的无理审讯。在英国、法国、芬兰、瑞典、印度、日本以及南美一些国家，群众到驻在当地的西德使馆和领事馆去表示抗议。抗议审讯的电报和信件从世界各地如雪片般飞来，许多国家并且派了代表团到杜塞尔多夫来旁听审讯和对和平战士表示声援。一些著名的国际和平人士都以证人身份亲自到法庭上为和平战士辩护，痛斥西德当局迫害和平运动的卑劣阴谋。
