    Spring on the Mongolian Grasslands
    ——Visiting the "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative"
    By Our Correspondent Feng Ye

    In April, the temperature on the Mongolian grasslands is warming up, and the ice and snow that accumulated throughout the entire winter are gradually melting. The pastoralists who have achieved cooperativization are stepping into the first spring of the sixties with full confidence.

    During this busy and favorable season for pastoralists to tend lambs, shear wool, and prepare for spring plowing, we visited the "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative" on the Bayan-Tsogt grassland in the Central Province of Mongolia.

    The "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative" is located next to the main road from Ulaanbaatar to the western provinces. A month ago, the accumulated snow on both sides of the road was still a foot deep, and cars could only slide along a snow track pressed out by the wheels. Now, most of the snow has melted, and cars can speed up. Although the grassland has not yet turned green, its boundless original appearance is presented before our eyes, immediately making one feel open-minded. In the distant mountains, there are still some patches of snow, mottled like beautiful white patterns and designs, a particularly charming scenery.

    Last August, we accompanied the Chinese National People's Congress delegation headed by Vice Chairman Lin Boqu to visit this cooperative. I remember it was a clear and charming day, and the members of the cooperative sat on the green grass, warmly welcoming the people's representatives from the close brotherly neighbor. To commemorate this friendly meeting, the director, on behalf of the cooperative, announced on the spot that the cooperative's name would be changed to "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative." At the entrance of the cooperative, a wooden sign painted in bright colors was erected, with the national emblems of China and Mongolia and two hands clasped tightly together, symbolizing the close friendship between the two peoples. People visiting the cooperative and passing by here can see this sign from afar. Since then, many Chinese representatives visiting Mongolia, and Chinese employees working with the Mongolian people to carry out socialist construction, often come to the cooperative for visits, and the cooperative receives them as warmly as if they were family. The director, Comrade Dashnyam, told us such a story: one winter night last year, a truck came from Zavkhan Province in the west to go to Ulaanbaatar, but it broke down on the Bayan-Tsogt grassland. Several Chinese employees on the truck found the "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative," and the cooperative let them stay overnight in a warm room. The director said that we were very happy that the Chinese comrades knew about such a cooperative.

    Like many other cooperatives on the grasslands, 1959 was a historically significant year for the "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative." Last year, all one thousand and three pastoralist households in Bayan-Tsogt Sum (county), except for two employees living in Ulaanbaatar and one farm worker working on a farm, joined the cooperative, realizing full cooperativization in the entire Sum. More than 70% of the pastoralists' livestock voluntarily joined the cooperative, and the total livestock owned by the cooperative reached more than 53,000 heads. This is a very significant change. When the cooperative was established at the end of 1955, it had only more than fifty members and about 2,000 head of livestock. By the end of 1958, only more than 190 members had joined the cooperative.

    In 1959, the year when full cooperativization was achieved in the entire Sum, the cooperative overfulfilled its agricultural and livestock production tasks and the task of handing over livestock products to the state. Last year, the cooperative's livestock increased by more than 4,400 heads, overfulfilling the breeding plan by 10.5%; in agriculture, grain, vegetables, and feed were planted on more than 400 hectares of land last year. The crops grew very well, and more than 150 tons of wheat, more than 120 tons of feed, and a large quantity of potatoes and cabbage were harvested. These facts fully demonstrate the superiority of cooperativization.

    Last year, the cooperative also built a small power station, installed telephone lines, built student dormitories, and established a radio station. The buildings in the cooperative's central area have increased. The director said that last winter, Chinese employees used their Sundays to carry out voluntary labor in the cooperative, helping the cooperative to build power stations and dormitories. The members of the cooperative highly praised and were grateful for the spirit of the Chinese workers, who braved the severe cold and quickly built houses to help the cooperative. They brought fresh milk and tea to the construction site, demonstrating the brotherly friendship between Chinese and Mongolian workers and pastoralists.

    With the overfulfillment of production tasks, the income of the members of the cooperative has also increased. In 1958, in terms of cash income, each work day averaged three Tugriks (Mongolian currency). In 1959, it reached six Tugriks, an increase of 100%. More importantly, the participation of members in cooperative labor has greatly increased compared with previous years.

    At the end of 1959, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party discussed the new situation of agricultural and pastoral cooperativization and made important resolutions on consolidating cooperatives organizationally and economically. The Party's resolutions further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the laboring pastoralists. After conveying the spirit of the Party's resolutions, the "Mongolia-China Friendship Cooperative" immediately convened a meeting of members' representatives to discuss this year's new tasks. The director told us that more than 18,000 lambs will be born this year, and the cultivated area will be expanded to 1,070 hectares. In order to adapt to this new situation, the cooperative's production organization has also been adjusted. The cooperative is divided into six specialized production teams for animal husbandry, agriculture, and sideline occupations, mobilizing all members to actively participate in production labor. The labor day plan for this year will increase by tens of thousands compared to last year. The cooperative will also build cultural and welfare facilities such as clubs, garages, and bathhouses.

    Currently, it is the busy season for lambing. So far, more than 7,800 lambs have been born in the cooperative. The director said that this year, the cooperative will build sheds in more than 80 livestock grazing locations, so that all livestock, large and small, will have warm sheds and warm pens, protecting the livestock to safely overwinter in the future. He said that this is a very heavy task, but the cooperative has forests, as well as the determination inspired by the Party's resolutions, and this year's task will definitely be completed.

    The director led us to visit the agricultural and pastoral production teams of the cooperative. The cooperative's site is 60 kilometers long from east to west and 40 kilometers wide from north to south, with pastures and cultivated land. The members are scattered around the grasslands grazing livestock. After driving more than 30 kilometers, we arrived at the agricultural production team. The captain, Dashi Dorji, told us that the preparations for spring plowing have been completed, and the animal husbandry machinery station will immediately send six tractors to help with spring plowing. The director said that this year, the cooperative also has an "Iron Ox" brand tractor donated by the Chinese National People's Congress delegation, preparing to cultivate more than 100 hectares of land itself and plant alfalfa feed.

    The production captain led us to visit a ditch, where a group of male and female members were digging a ditch. This area is short of water, and the cooperative uses the melted snow from the mountains to irrigate a part of the vegetable fields. They said that after Qingming, the melted snow water will come down, so they are rushing to repair the ditch to prevent the water from flowing away.

    From the ditch, we came to another piece of grassland, where a large group of horses were fenced in, and female members were shearing horsehair on the ground. Horses, accustomed to roaming freely on the grassland, need to go through a struggle to be laid down on the ground and tamely let people shear their hair. Strong and healthy young men used lasso poles to lasso the wild horses one by one. After a struggle, if the horse could not escape the young men's lassoes, it would docilely let the members shear its hair. The director told us that these members were all members of the agricultural team, and because they had not yet started sowing, they came to assist the pastoral team. The cooperative has more than 9,000 horses. Last year, when Chinese Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan visited the cooperative, the cooperative gave 150 horses to a people's commune in Zhangbei County, and expressed its willingness to establish contact with this commune. This deep friendship is a great encouragement and support to this commune.

    We came to the Mongolian yurt of member Qierdun. The hostess was taking care of the calves. She invited us into the house and treated us with fresh yogurt and milk curd. They and his wife were old members who joined the cooperative in 1955 and have been grazing more than 100 dairy cows. Due to their careful breeding, all the calves born each year survive. This year, the cows have already given birth to twenty-eight calves.

    This young couple has a horse, four cows, and ten sheep. Now, except for one dairy cow, all have joined the cooperative. They used their own personal experience to tell us about the changes in the cooperative. The cooperative has grown from small to large, production has gradually developed, and their income has increased year by year. The hostess pointed to the sewing machine and radio on the table and said that these were all purchased with their labor income in the past two years.

    We spent a pleasant day on the grassland and drove back to Ulaanbaatar in the evening breeze. The scene of the early spring hard work of the pastoralists on the grassland left a deep impression on us. Spring is the season when livestock are born on the grassland, and a bumper harvest is already in sight.

    蒙古草原的春天
    ——访“蒙中友谊合作社”
    本报记者　逢烨
    4月，蒙古草原的气温转暖，堆积了整整一冬的冰雪，已经逐渐消融。实现了合作化的牧民们，正满怀信心地跨入六十年代的第一个春天。
    就在牧民接羔、剪毛和准备春耕的繁忙的大好季节，我们到蒙古中央省巴彦朝克图草原，访问了“蒙中友谊合作社”。
    “蒙中友谊合作社”在乌兰巴托通往西部各省的要道旁边。一个月前，路两旁的积雪还有尺来深，汽车只能在车轮压出的一条雪道上滑行，现在，积雪大部溶化了，汽车可以放开速度前进了。虽然草原还没有发绿，但是它那一望无垠的本来面目，呈现在眼前，顿时使人心胸开朗。远山，还有几许残雪，斑斑驳驳，像白色的美丽花纹和图案，别是一番诱人的风光。
    去年8月，我们曾随以林伯渠副委员长为首的我国人大代表团，访问了这个合作社。记得那是个晴朗迷人的日子，社员们坐在绿色草地上，热烈欢迎来自亲密的兄弟邻邦的人民代表。为了纪念这次友好的会见，社长代表合作社当场宣布，把社名改为“蒙中友谊合作社”。在合作社的大门口，竖立起一块用鲜艳的颜色画的木牌，上面画着中、蒙两国的国徽和两只紧紧握着的手，标志着两国人民的亲密友谊。到合作社和途经这里的人，远远地就能看见这个标牌。从那时起，许多来蒙古访问的中国代表，在蒙古和蒙古人民一起进行社会主义建设的中国员工，经常到合作社参观访问，合作社像接待亲人一样的殷切。社长达什尼亚木同志向我们讲述这样一个故事：去年冬天的一个夜晚，从西部扎布汗省来了一辆卡车，要到乌兰巴托去，但是在巴彦朝克图草原抛锚了。车子上的几个中国员工找到“蒙中友谊合作社”，合作社留他们在温暖的屋子里住了一夜。社长说，中国同志们知道有这样一个合作社，我们感到很高兴。
    像其他草原上的许多合作社一样，1959年是“蒙中友谊合作社”有历史意义的一年。去年，巴彦朝克图苏木（县）的一千零三户牧民，除两户职工住在乌兰巴托，一户农场工人在农场工作外，其他一千户牧民全部加入合作社，实现了全苏木合作化。牧民所有牲畜的70％多都自愿入了社，全社社有的牲畜达到五万三千多头。这是一个非常巨大的变化。这个社在1955年底建社时，只有五十多户社员，两千来头牲畜。到1958年底，也只有一百九十多户社员入社。
    就在全苏木实现合作化的1959年，合作社的农牧业生产任务和上交国家畜产品的任务，都超额完成了。去年合作社净增了四千四百多头牲畜，超额10.5％完成了增殖计划；农业方面，去年在四百多公顷土地上播种了谷物、蔬菜和饲料，庄稼长得很好，收获了一百五十多吨小麦，一百二十多吨饲料，以及大批的土豆和白菜。这些事实，充分说明了合作化的优越性。
    去年合作社还修建了小型发电站，安装了电话线，盖了学生宿舍，成立了广播站。社中心地的建筑增多起来了。社长同志说，去年冬天，中国员工曾利用礼拜天，到合作社进行义务劳动，帮助合作社修建电站和宿舍。社员们对于中国工人冒着严寒，快速施工帮助合作社修建房屋的精神，十分称赞和感激。他们来工地上送鲜奶，送茶水，表现了中蒙工人和牧民的兄弟情谊。
    随着生产任务的超额完成，社员们的收入也增加了。1958年，就现金收入来说，每个劳动日平均为三图格里克（蒙币）。1959年达到六图格里克，增加了一倍。更重要的是，社员参加合作社的劳动，比往年大大增加了。
    1959年底，蒙古人民革命党四中全会讨论了农牧业合作化的新形势，作出了从组织上和经济上巩固合作社的重要决议。党的决议进一步鼓舞了劳动牧民的生产积极性。“蒙中友谊合作社”在传达了党的决议精神后，立即召开社员代表大会，讨论今年的新任务。社长同志告诉我们，今年将要接羔一万八千多只，耕地面积扩大到一千零七十公顷。为适应这个新情况，社的生产组织也作了调整，全社共分牧业、农业和副业等六个专业生产队，动员全体社员积极参加生产劳动。今年的劳动日计划将比去年增加几万个。合作社还要修建俱乐部、车库和洗澡堂等文化福利设备。
    目前，正是接羔繁忙的季节。到现在为止，全社已经接羔七千八百多只。社长说，今年全社将在八十多处牲畜放牧的地点搭盖棚圈，使大小牲畜都有暖棚暖圈，保护牲畜今后安全过冬。他说，这是一项很重的任务，但是合作社有林木，还有大家为党的决议所鼓舞起来的决心，今年的任务是一定能够完成的。
    社长领我们到合作社的农、牧业生产队去参观。合作社社址东西长六十公里，南北宽四十公里，有牧场，有耕地，社员们分散在四周草地上放牧牲畜。车行三十多公里，我们来到了农业生产队。队长达西道尔吉告诉我们，春耕生产的准备工作已经作好了，畜牧业机器站马上就要开来六台拖拉机帮助春耕。社长说，今年，合作社还有中国人大代表团送的一台铁牛牌拖拉机，准备自己耕地一百多公顷，种上苜蓿饲料。
    生产队长领我们到一条水沟边参观，那里有一群男女社员在挖水沟。这一带缺水，社里利用山上溶化的积雪，灌溉一部分蔬菜地。他们说，清明过后，溶雪水就要下来了，因此赶着修沟，不让水流走。
    从沟渠旁来到另一块草地上，一大群马匹被圈起来，女社员们正在地上剪马毛。在草地上任意游走惯了的马匹，要将它放倒下地，叫它服贴地让人剪毛，需要经过一番斗争。身体壮健的年青小伙子们，拿着套马杆子，把一匹匹烈性马套住。马儿经过一番挣扎，要是逃不出小伙子们的马套子，便驯服地让社员剪毛了。社长告诉我们，这些社员都是农业队的队员，因为还没有开始播种，他们来协助牧业队工作。合作社共有九千多匹马。去年，我国农业部长廖鲁言同志访问合作社时，合作社赠送我张北县一个人民公社一百五十匹马，并表示要和这个公社取得联系。这种深情厚谊，对这个公社是一种很大的鼓舞和支援。
    我们来到社员其尔敦的蒙古包前。女主人正在照料小牛犊。她请我们到家里坐，用新鲜的酸奶和奶豆腐来招待我们。他们夫妇是1955年入社的老社员，一直放牧一百多头乳牛。由于他们精心的饲养，每年接生的牛犊全部成活。今年，母牛已经生下二十八头小牛犊。
    这一对年青的社员，有一匹马、四头牛和十只羊，现在除一头乳牛外，全部加入了合作社。他们用自己的亲身经历，向我们讲述了合作社的变化。合作社由小到大，生产逐渐发展，他们的收入也一年比一年增多了。女主人指着桌上的缝纫机和收音机说，这都是他们用近两年来的劳动收入购买的。
    我们在草原上度过了一天愉快的日子，迎着晚风，乘车驶回乌兰巴托。草原牧民初春辛勤劳动的景象，给我们留下深刻的印象。春天是草原牲畜降生的日子，丰收已经在望了。
