    Advocating the "Analogy Method"
    Wu Lü
    The "four-eight cross operation" is an advanced experience of coal mines, and later iron mines learned it. Today's news says that the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory also used this experience, which strengthened the unity and cooperation of workers, strengthened production preparation, and enabled the potential of manpower and equipment to be fully utilized. This matter gives us a deep inspiration. "Different industries are not that different." It seems that the principles of many advanced experiences have a certain universal significance and can be widely promoted in different industries "by analogy." This courage to absorb the advanced experience of others, and to "by analogy" taking into account the different circumstances in the industry and unit, can be called the "analogy method."

    The era of the Great Leap Forward, in which you chase me and everyone strives forward, is an era in which the "analogy method" is greatly promoted. The advanced technical and management experience of one industry allows other industries to learn from it, which is only the "analogy method" of technical and management experience. The thousands upon thousands of red banner units and model experts in the technological revolution have an impact in a wider range due to their advanced thinking and advanced deeds. The Shanghai Zhichengxing Iron and Steel Products Factory's "revolution with a kitchen knife" has encouraged factories in all walks of life in Shanghai to take the road of self-reliance and march towards technology. "If others can do it, why can't we?" has become the loudest voice of our time. The upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced has made the "analogy method" a weapon for the broad masses to continuously revolutionize.

    The "analogy method" is a working method that combines the general and the individual, and uses the individual to guide the general. Although there are thousands of differences between all things in the world, they have common laws of development. Enterprises have advanced and backward distinctions, but the backward can also catch up with the advanced by learning from the advanced. Comrades who do leadership work must be good at using the "analogy method," grasping individual advanced models to drive the general; and be good at "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance," continuously absorbing nutrients and finding lessons from various advanced ideas, advanced deeds, and advanced experiences to stimulate the fighting spirit of the masses. The widespread application of the "analogy method" is the great promotion of advanced thinking and the great popularization of advanced experience. Without the "analogy method," enterprises and industries would not communicate with each other, and there would be no bustling and thriving situation.

    The situation is pressing. Pressing for what? Pressing people to catch up with the advanced. Under this situation, the "analogy method" will inevitably be more widely and better used.

    提倡“类推法”
    吴滤
    四八交叉作业是煤矿的先进经验，后来铁矿学了起来。今天的消息说：沈阳冶金机械修造厂也运用这个经验，密切了工人的团结协作，加强了生产准备，使人力和设备的潜力得到充分的发挥。这件事，给我们很深的启发。“隔行不隔理”，看来，许多先进经验的原理都是具有一定的普遍意义，可以在不同的行业里“依此类推”，得到广泛地推行。这种勇于吸取别人的先进经验，在本行业和本单位照顾不同的情况“依此类推”，可名之曰“类推法”。
    你追我赶、百舸争流的大跃进的时代，是“类推法”大发扬的时代。一个行业技术上和管理上的先进经验，使别的行业得到借鉴，还只是技术经验和管理经验的“类推法”。千千万万技术革命的红旗单位和标兵能手，他们的先进思想和先进事迹则在更广大的范围内发生影响。上海志成兴钢铁制品厂“一把菜刀闹革命”，就鼓舞着上海各行各业的工厂走自力更生的道路向技术进军。“别人能做到的，为什么我们不能做到”，成为我们时代最嘹亮的声音。学先进、赶先进的热潮，更使“类推法”成为广大群众不断革命的斗争武器。
    “类推法”是一种一般和个别相结合，用个别指导一般的工作方法。世间万物，尽管有千差万别，却有着共同的发展规律。企业有先进落后之别，但是落后的学习先进，也可以赶上先进。做领导工作的同志要善于运用“类推法”，抓住个别的先进典型带动一般；并且要善于“举一反三”，不断地从各种各类先进思想、先进事迹和先进经验里吸取营养，找到借鉴，来激发群众的斗志。“类推法”的广泛应用，就是先进思想的大发扬，先进经验的大普及。没有“类推法”，企业之间、行业之间各不相通，也就没有热气腾腾的局面。
    形势逼人。逼什么？逼人赶上先进。在这种形势下，“类推法”必然会得到更广泛的和更好的运用。
