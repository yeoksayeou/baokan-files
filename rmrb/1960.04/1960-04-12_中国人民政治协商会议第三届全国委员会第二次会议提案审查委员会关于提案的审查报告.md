Report on the Examination of Proposals by the Proposals Examination Committee of the Second Session of the Third Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee
	Chen Zhengren, Convenor of the Proposals Examination Committee of the Second Session of the Third Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee

The Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference received a total of sixty-one proposals, including eleven related to industry, thirteen related to agriculture, two related to finance and trade, eighteen related to culture, seven related to education, three related to science, six related to health, and one related to civil affairs.

The contents of these proposals are mostly constructive opinions put forward based on the current needs of the country and the people, reflecting the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in participating in the cause of socialist construction under the glorious light of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

The Proposals Examination Committee first divided these proposals into three specialized review groups, carefully analyzed and studied them, and put forward preliminary review opinions, which were then discussed and approved case by case by the full committee meeting. Based on the results of the review, we suggest: all those that are being handled or planned to be handled, as well as those that should be handled and can be handled, should be submitted to the relevant departments of the State Council for review and handling; all those that require careful planning to be handled, or require preparation of conditions and gradual implementation, should be submitted to the relevant departments of the State Council for research and handling; all those for which a comprehensive investigation and in-depth understanding of the actual situation are still needed to determine whether they can be handled, should be submitted to the relevant departments of the State Council for research.

Proposals received after April 6th are suggested to be submitted to the Standing Committee for review and handling.

Now, the "Proposals and Proposal Review Opinions (Draft) of the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," passed by the Proposals Examination Committee, is submitted to the conference for deliberation and approval.

    这些提案的内容，大都是根据当前国家和人民的需要而提出的建设性的意见，反映了在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉照耀下，各方面人士参加社会主义建设事业的积极性。
    提案审查委员会对于这些提案，先分成三个专业审查组，认真地进行了分析和研究，提出初步审查意见，然后由委员会全体会议逐案讨论通过。根据审查结果，我们建议：凡是正在办理和计划办理的，以及应当办理而又可能办理的，都分别建议国务院交有关部门审核办理；凡是需要周密筹划才能办理的，或者需要准备条件，逐步实施的，都分别建议国务院交有关部门研究办理；凡是对实际情况尚需进行全面调查和深入了解才能肯定能否办理的，都分别建议国务院交有关部门研究。
    在4月6日以后收到的提案，建议都交由常务委员会审查处理。
    现在把提案审查委员会通过的“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议提案和提案审查意见（草案）”向大会提出，请予审议通过。
