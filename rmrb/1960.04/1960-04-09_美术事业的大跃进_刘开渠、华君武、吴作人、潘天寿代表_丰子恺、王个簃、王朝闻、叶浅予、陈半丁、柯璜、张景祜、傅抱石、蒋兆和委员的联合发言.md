Chairman, fellow representatives:
	We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1959 state final accounts and the draft 1960 state budget.

	**The Artworks in the Capital's Ten Great Buildings**

	We are all meeting in this magnificent Great Hall of the People, built at high speed, and like our comrades, we feel happy and proud. First of all, we will take the art works in this Great Hall and other new buildings in the capital as examples to report to the conference on the new face of the Great Leap Forward in the arts. Like the socialist construction of industry and agriculture in our motherland, the development of the arts in the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, whether in quantity and quality, scale and speed, is exciting. The art works in the capital's ten great buildings can be said to be a microcosm of the Great Leap Forward in the arts; this is an achievement made in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600 paintings of various kinds were created for the ten great buildings in the capital; more than 2,500 decorative design drawings; 110 sculptures of various sizes, and 300 tons of clay were used for making the sculptures; folk artists made more than 1,000 clay figures of various sizes for the ten great buildings; in terms of handicrafts, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have arranged lounges in the Great Hall, from screens, carpets, furniture displays to a teacup, a cigarette dish, all with local characteristics, truly a hundred flowers bloom, competing for beauty. These magnificent buildings themselves are the embodiment of the general line and the Great Leap Forward; from design and construction to completion, it took only ten months! This astonishing speed is also a miracle in the history of architecture at home and abroad. The art work took only eight months from the start of organizing the forces to the completion of the task. The workers built the buildings layer by layer at high speed, and the design drawings of the arts and crafts artists also had to catch up layer by layer. The five hundred design drawings of the Great Hall took only three months, and the design drawings of dozens of different kinds of lamps were rushed out in two weeks. Many of the furniture in the news halls arranged by the provinces and cities were rushed out in just over ten days. In the past, it took at least three months to make a Fujian lacquer bottle, but now it only takes one month to complete it. The two huge sculpture groups in front of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall took only four months from drafting to completion.

	The art work of the ten great buildings is not only large in quantity and fast in speed, but also has improved in quality. Taking decorative design and handicrafts as examples, whether in terms of shape, color, pattern, and practical effect, it does not deviate from our national style, achieving Chinese style and Chinese spirit; there are also bold innovations and creations, with the breath of the times. Many handicrafts prominently express local characteristics, and there have also been great improvements and enhancements in craftsmanship. For example, the enamelware in the Shaanxi Hall has unique creations in terms of color, pattern, and product quality. Another example is Fujian's bodiless lacquerware, which could only be used to make some small furniture in the past. Large standing bottles and large lions, more than one person tall, are all new attempts and have been successful. The art works arranged in various buildings and the historical paintings, revolutionary historical paintings, military history paintings, and sculptures displayed in various museums have all significantly improved in ideological and artistic level. For example, the two sculpture groups "Long Live the People's Commune" in front of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall, the huge Chinese painting "Land So Rich in Beauty" at the entrance of the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People, and many other paintings and sculptures are all good works that the masses love to see and hear. Some excellent works embody the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism; have new creations on the basis of inheriting tradition; have rich and colorful forms and styles, and achieve the unity of revolutionary content and the most perfect form possible.

	In the art work of the ten great buildings, artists, folk artists, and worker comrades showed a revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, daring to think and act, showing a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility for building socialism, and showing the spirit of communist collaboration. These facts eloquently prove that art work can and should be done more, faster, better, and more economically without exception.

	The impact and role of the art work of the ten great buildings should also be fully estimated. At present, many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are also using the revolutionary spirit and working methods of the ten great buildings in the capital to build new public buildings, which will inevitably save a lot of manpower, material resources, and time for the country. The promotion effect of the art work of the ten great buildings on the arts and crafts industry is particularly significant. Through the arrangement of the lounges in the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, a revolutionary competition has been formed between each other, learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced; tapping potential, finding tricks, and giving full play to initiative and creativity, so that the production of arts and crafts in many provinces and cities has not only greatly developed and improved on the original basis, but also filled many gaps. Industries that did not exist in the past now exist, and links that were relatively weak in the past have now been enriched. Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have increased the variety of arts and crafts products, improved the quality, and the technology is also constantly innovating. These new buildings and the art works in them not only have a great inspiring and educational effect on the people, but also have a positive impact internationally.

	The reason why the art work of the ten great buildings can achieve the above achievements, the most valuable and fundamental experience is only two points: that is, relying on the leadership of the Party and resolutely taking the mass line.

	All these achievements are simply unimaginable without the leadership of the Party. First of all, this is the result of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction; the result of embodying the Party's literary and art policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new"; and the result of implementing the Party's educational policy of "combining education with productive labor" and combining with practice. Specifically speaking, for example, the lounges arranged by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are all under the direct leadership of the local Party committee, with the secretary taking the lead, grasping from design, construction to display and arrangement to the end. The deepest experience of teachers and students of various art colleges participating in the art work of the ten great buildings is that "listening to the Party and putting politics in command" can create miracles. Glory belongs to our Party and the great leader Chairman Mao!

	On the other hand, such a complex and arduous task could not be completed if only relying on a few artists, even plus the old folk artists. From the beginning, this work launched a magnificent mass movement in the art world. Artists, folk artists, workers, and young students from art colleges all over the country understood that the art work of the ten great buildings was a glorious political task, and a high degree of political enthusiasm inevitably produced a high degree of initiative and creativity. Some comrades even forgot to eat and sleep in order to complete the task. Some comrades had never painted such a large painting, nor had such a large paintbrush, so they tied a paintbrush to a stick to paint. In the work, artists combined with architects, arts and crafts artists combined with folk artists, designers combined with workers, teachers combined with young students, there are many vivid examples in these aspects. The creative process mostly adopted the method of combining collective discussion and research with individual creative spirit. Many designs and works often went through repeated discussions, everyone came up with ideas and thought of ways, and were revised again and again. Almost every creation and handicraft, every design, no one dared to say that it was his personal creation. In fact, they are all the crystallization of collective wisdom of the masses, and all the products of the spirit of communist collaboration. Through the art work of the ten great buildings, the proletarian art team was expanded, countless talents were cultivated and discovered, the level of art creation was improved, and the technological innovation of handicrafts production was promoted... Endless benefits are all derived from resolutely taking the mass line.

	The Great Leap Forward in the arts, of course, is not only manifested in the art work of the ten great buildings. Last year, in order to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions held provincial (city, autonomous region) art exhibitions, created tens of thousands of new works, and played a good role in propaganda and education for the people.

	**The Rapid Development of Mass Art Creation**

	In addition to the creations of professional artists, another important aspect worth mentioning is the rapid development of the art creation of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	In the spring of 1958, the peasants of Pixian County, Jiangsu, and Shulu County, Hebei, in order to promote production, publicize the Party's policies, and carry out self-education, took the lead in creating a large number of murals with the spirit of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act, and gradually formed a climax of mural creation in rural areas across the country. The art creation of workers and soldiers has also been rapidly developed and improved on the original basis. The participants in the creation included old women in rural areas, elementary school students, steel workers, generals and soldiers. From then on, workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only appreciators of art works, but also take up their brushes and become creators of art; this is an unprecedented new thing, an important part of our country's cultural revolution. The Great Leap Forward in mass art has extremely important and far-reaching significance for the further prosperity of art creation, for the close combination of artists and the masses, for the growth and strengthening of the proletarian art team, and even for the gradual elimination of the difference between manual and mental labor.

	Mass art creation is developing rapidly and continuously improving on the basis of popularization. The worker-peasant prints of Zhanjiang, Guangdong, the peasant sculptures and murals of Qingyang, Gansu, the peasant murals of Fuyang, Anhui, the worker prints of Wugang, the prints and paper-cuts of naval soldiers, and the mass art exhibitions held in various provinces, which are touring in Beijing and other places, all prominently demonstrate this point. The people's commune peasants in Kaiping, Guangdong, Linhai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu and other places have also opened printmaking training classes and published their own print selections. The improvement of soldiers' art creation is particularly concentrated in the Second All-Army Art Exhibition of the People's Liberation Army held in Beijing recently.

	This art exhibition has produced many good works that are not inferior to professional artists, such as "A Heroic Father Has a Heroic Son," "Parting Picture," "Orphan," "First Shooting," "General's Field," "The Awakening of the Prairie"...and so on. The emergence of these works is mainly due to the fact that the authors are educated by the Party in the revolutionary collective life, have lofty and beautiful ideals, and have a deep feeling for the revolutionary struggle life, thus forming an urgent need for creation. Therefore, the works are full of revolutionary passion and patriotism and internationalism, and show the heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army. These works of soldiers, like the works of workers and peasants, are both motivating and artistic; both militant and lyrical. It is really inspiring to see the mass art team growing stronger day by day, the creation is so prosperous, and the level is constantly improving. The prosperity and development of mass art creation has played a great inspiring and promoting role for professional artists. Many excellent mass creations also have great inspiration for professional creations.

	Our country's mass art creation has also been valued abroad. We have sent the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Painting Exhibition" to the German Democratic Republic for exhibition and received praise and encouragement; this painting exhibition is also being prepared to be exhibited in other fraternal countries.

	Fellow representatives: In a short speech, we cannot describe the full picture of the development of the arts in the past ten years. Even if we only talk about the art work of the ten great buildings and the art creation of the masses, we cannot talk about it completely and fully; however, from these two aspects, it is enough to show that the vast number of professional and amateur art workers, under the leadership of the Party, are marching forward with great strides under the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art! However, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made. Compared with the achievements of the Great Leap Forward on other fronts of the motherland, our achievements are still very small; there is still a considerable distance between the current situation of the arts and the requirements of the Party, the country, and the people for art work. Many glorious and arduous tasks remain for us to work hard to complete. We deeply realize that artists must combine with the working people, must constantly transform their own thoughts, establish and consolidate the world outlook of the working class, and possess the position and feelings of the working people. Only by combining experts and the masses, implementing a series of two-legged walking policies, can our art cause achieve a greater leap forward. A new creative upsurge is taking shape in the art world, preparing to present the fortieth anniversary of the birth of our great and glorious Communist Party of China with better art works on July 1 next year. To this end, we must constantly improve our political consciousness and artistic cultivation, and strengthen artistic practice. A heat wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has been set off in the art world. We must use Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art as a weapon to carry out a resolute struggle against modern revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois literary and art thoughts. The proletarian art team will become stronger and grow in this struggle.

	We art workers must go all out, aim high, set lofty aspirations, and work with other literary and art workers to climb the artistic peak of the working class.

    美术事业的大跃进
    刘开渠、华君武、吴作人、潘天寿代表　丰子恺、王个簃、王朝闻、叶浅予、陈半丁、柯璜、张景祜、傅抱石、蒋兆和委员的联合发言主席，各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于
    1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    首都十大建筑的美术工作
    我们大家正在这座高速度建成的雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂开会，心情也和同志们一样，感到幸福和自豪。首先，我们就以这座大会堂和首都其他新建筑的美术工作为例子，向大会汇报一下美术事业大跃进的新面貌。和祖国工农业社会主义建设一样，十年来，特别是大跃进以来，美术事业的发展，无论数量和质量、规模和速度，都是令人兴奋的。首都十大建筑的美术工作，可以说是美术事业大跃进的一个缩影；这是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线所取得的成就。根据不完全的统计，为首都十大建筑创作的各种绘画共达六百余件；装饰设计的图纸二千五百多张；大小雕塑一百零一座，制作雕塑所用的黄泥就有三百吨；泥塑民间艺人为十大建筑制作的大小泥人共一千多个；在工艺品方面，各省、市、自治区都在大会堂布置了休息厅，从屏风、地毯、家具陈列到一只茶杯、一个烟碟，都具有各地的特色，真是百花齐放，比美争姘。这些雄伟建筑本身，就是总路线的体现，大跃进的体现；从设计、施工到落成总共不过十个月！这种惊人的速度，在中外建筑史上也是一个奇迹。美术工作从开始组织力量到完成任务只有八个多月，工人们高速度地把大楼一层一层造上去，工艺美术家的设计图纸也要一层一层赶上去。大会堂的五百张设计图纸，只用了三个月的时间，其中几十种不同的灯具设计图纸，两个星期就赶画出来了。各省市布置的消息厅中，有许多家具，都是十多天赶制出来的。福建大漆瓶过去最快也要三个多月才能制成，现在只用一个月就完成了。农业馆门前的两组巨大的雕塑群像，从起草到完成只用了四个月时间。
    十大建筑的美术工作不但数量多，速度快，而且质量也有所提高。以装饰设计和工艺品为例，无论是造型、色彩、纹样和实用的效果，既不脱离我们民族的风格，做到了中国作风、
  中国气派；又有大胆的革新和创造，具有时代的气息。许多工艺品突出地表现了地方色彩，在工艺技术上也有很大的改进和提高。例如陕西厅的搪瓷器，在色彩、纹样和产品质量方面，都有独特的创造性。又如福建的脱胎漆器，以前只能做一些小家具，一人多高的大立瓶、大狮子等，都是新的尝试，并且获得了成功。各大建筑布置的美术作品及各个博物馆陈列的历史画、革命历史画、军史画和雕塑，思想水平和艺术水平都有了显著的提高。例如刚才提到的农业馆门前两组雕塑“人民公社万岁”，大会堂宴会厅入口处的巨幅国画“江山如此多娇”和许多其它的绘画雕塑作品等，都是群众喜闻乐见的好作品。有些优秀的作品，体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则；在继承传统的基础上，有新的创造；形式风格丰富多彩，做到了革命的内容和尽可能完美的形式的统一。
    美术家、民间艺人和工人同志们在十大建筑的美术工作中，表现了不怕困难、敢想敢干的革命干劲，表现了建设社会主义的高度热情和责任感，表现了共产主义大协作的精神，这些事实都雄辩地证明了美术工作无例外地可以而且应该多、快、好、省。
    对于十大建筑美术工作产生的影响和作用，也要作充分的估计。目前许多省、市、自治区也都在用首都十大建筑的革命精神和工作方法建造新的公共建筑物，这必然会为国家节省很多人力、物力和时间。十大建筑美术工作对于工艺美术事业的推动作用尤其显著，通过省、市、自治区休息厅的布置，互相之间形成了革命竞赛，学先进，比先进、赶先进；挖潜力、找窍门，充分发挥积极性和创造性，使得许多省市的工艺品生产，不但在原有的基础上有了很大的发展和提高，而且填补了许多空白，过去没有的行业现在有了，过去比较薄弱的环节现在充实起来了。许多省、市、自治区增加了工艺品的生产品种，提高了质量，工艺技术也在不断革新。这些新的建筑和其中的美术作品，不但对人民群众有很大的鼓舞教育作用，在国际上也产生了良好的影响。
    十大建筑美术工作所以能够取得以上这些成绩，最宝贵、最根本的经验只有两条：就是依靠党的领导和坚决走群众路线。
    这一切的成就，结果离开党的领导，简直不可想像。首先，这是贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的结果；是体现党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新”的文艺方针的结果；是执行党的“教育和生产劳动相结合”和实际相结合的教育方针的结果。具体的讲，譬如各省、市、自治区布置的休息厅，就都是在当地党委直接领导之下，书记挂帅，从设计、施工到陈列布置一抓到底的。各美术院校师生参加十大建筑美术工作的最深刻的体会就是“听党的话，政治挂帅”才能创造奇迹。光荣归于我们的党和伟大的领袖毛主席！
    另一方面，这样复杂艰巨的任务，如果仅仅依靠少数美术家，甚至再加上民间老艺人，肯定是不可能完成的。这个工作从开始在美术界就掀起了一个规模壮阔的群众运动，全国的美术家、民间艺人、工人、美术院校的青年学生们都理解十大建筑的美术工作是一个光荣的政治任务，高度的政治热情必然产生高度的积极性和创造性，有的同志为了完成任务甚至废寝忘餐。有的同志从来没有画过这么大的画，也没有这样大的画笔，就用根棍子绑上画笔来作画。在工作中，美术家和建筑师相结合，工艺美术家和民间艺人相结合，设计师和工人相结合，老师和青年学生相结合，这些方面生动的例子很多。创作过程大都采取了集体讨论研究和个人创造精神相结合的方法，许多设计和作品常常经过反复的讨论，大家出主意、想办法，一次又一次地修改，几乎每一件创作和工艺品，每一项设计没有一个人敢于说是他个人的创作，实际上都是群众集体智慧的结晶，都是共产主义协作精神的产物。通过十大建筑的美术工作，扩大了无产阶级的美术队伍，培养和发现了无数人材，提高了美术创作水平，促进了工艺品生产的技术革新……说不完的好处都是坚决走群众路线得来的。
    美术事业的大跃进，当然并不仅仅表现在十大建筑的美术工作方面。去年各省、市、自治区为了迎接建国十周年，大都举办了全省（市、自治区）的美展，创作了数以万计的新作品，对人民群众起了很好的宣传教育作用。
    群众美术创作的飞跃发展
    除了专业美术工作者的创作之外，另一个值得大书特书的重要方面就是工农兵群众美术创作的飞跃发展。
    1958年春天，江苏邳县和河北束鹿的农民，为了促进生产，宣传党的政策，进行自我教育，以破除迷信、敢想敢干的精神，带头创作了大量的壁画，逐渐形成了全国农村壁画创作的高潮。工人和战士的美术创作，也在原有的基础上，有了迅速的发展和提高。参加创作的有农村的老大娘，有小学生，有炼钢工人，有将军和士兵。工农兵群众从此不仅是美术作品的欣赏者，自己也拿起了画笔成为艺术的创造者；这是亘古未有的新鲜事物，是我国文化革命的一个重要组成部分。群众美术的大跃进，对于美术创作进一步的繁荣，对于美术家和群众的紧密结合，对于无产阶级美术队伍的成长壮大，以至对于逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，都具有极为重大而深远的意义。
    群众美术创作正在普及的基础上迅速发展和不断提高。在北京和各地巡回展出的广东湛江的工农版画，甘肃庆阳的农民雕塑和壁画，安徽阜阳的农民壁画，武钢的工人版画，海军战士的版画和剪纸以及各省举行的群众美术展览会都突出的表现这一点。广东开平、浙江临海和江苏等地的人民公社农民们还开办了版画训练班，出版了自己的版画选集。战士美术创作的提高，在最近北京举办的解放军第二届全军美展中，特别集中地表现出来了。
    这个美展出现了许多比之专业美术家并无逊色的好作品，如“老子英雄儿好汉”、“惜别画”、“孤儿”、“第一次射击”、“将军田”、“渡口”、“草原初醒”……等等。这些作品的产生，主要由于作者在革命的集体生活中，受到党的教育，有崇高而美好的理想，对于革命的斗争生活有深切的感受，从而形成了创作的迫切要求。因此在作品中洋溢着革命的激情和爱国主义、国际主义的精神，表现了人民解放军的英雄气概。战士们的这些作品和工农作品一样，既有鼓动性又有艺术性；既有战斗性又富于抒情的特色。看到群众美术队伍一天天壮大，创作如此繁荣，水平又不断在提高，真是令人振奋。群众美术创作的繁荣和发展，对专业美术家起了极大的鼓舞和促进作用。许多优秀的群众创作，对专业创作也有很大启发。
    我国的群众美术创作，在国外也受到重视，我们曾把“工农兵画展”送到德意志民主共和国展出，得到了赞扬和鼓励；这个画展还准备到其他兄弟国家展出。
    各位代表：在短短的发言中，我们不可能描绘十年来美术事业发展的全貌，就是只讲十大建筑的美术工作和群众美术创作也讲得不够完全和充分；不过从这两方面的例子，也足以说明广大的专业和业余美术工作者，在党的领导下，在高举毛泽东文艺思想的红旗大步前进！但是，我们丝毫也不能满足于已经取得的成就，比起祖国其他各个战线上大跃进的成果来，我们的成就还很小；美术事业的现状与党、国家和人民对美术工作的要求之间，还存在着不小的距离。许多光荣而艰巨的任务，还有待于我们努力去完成。我们更深刻地体会到美术家必须和劳动人民相结合，必须不断改造自己的思想，建立和巩固工人阶级的世界观，具备劳动人民的立场和感情。只有专家和群众相结合，执行一系列的两条腿走路的方针，我们的美术事业才能取得更大的跃进。现在美术界正形成一个新的创作高潮，准备用更好的美术作品，在明年七一，向我们伟大光荣的中国共产党诞生四十周年献礼。为此，我们必须不断提高政治觉悟和艺术修养，加强艺术实践。美术界已经掀起了一个学习毛主席著作的热潮，我们要以毛泽东文艺思想作为武器，和现代修正主义以及形形色色的资产阶级文艺思想进行坚决的斗争，无产阶级的美术队伍将在这个斗争中更加壮大成长起来。
    我们美术工作者一定鼓足干劲，力争上游，树雄心，立大志，和其他文艺工作者共同攀登工人阶级的艺术高峰。
