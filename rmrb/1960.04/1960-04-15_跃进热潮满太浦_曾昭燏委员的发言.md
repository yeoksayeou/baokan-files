Leaping Forward Tide Fills Tai Pu
Speech by Committee Member Zeng Zhaoyu

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I am extremely excited about the tremendous victories our people have achieved in economic and cultural construction over the past year under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

On every front of the national socialist construction endeavor, there are countless moving stories that demonstrate the new face of our society and provide profound education. I will only cite one example here.

In March of this year, I spent a few days at the Taipu River construction site in the Suzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province. The Taipu River is a canal being excavated to connect Taihu Lake and the Huangpu River, with a total length of 57.2 kilometers, a bottom width of 150 meters, and a surface width of 180 meters. Once this river is completed, it will fundamentally solve the problem of flooding in the Taihu Lake basin, facilitate farmland irrigation, and allow 3,000 to 4,000-ton freighters to sail directly from Shanghai Port into Taihu Lake. This project began in November 1958, and the first phase was completed in May 1959. This spring, the second phase of the project began, with 80,000 laborers from the Suzhou Special District投入 [invested] in the sections within the district. The earthwork for this section is now nearing completion.

From what I saw and heard in those few days, I gained a few insights:

This project embodies the superiority of the People's Commune. The southern Jiangsu region has always been characterized by cultivated fields and dense population. Now, to excavate such a large river, a large area of farmland and many villages would undoubtedly have to be dug up along the river and its banks, and tens of thousands of people would have to be relocated. This would be difficult to do under individual farming, and even under the organizational form of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, it would be fraught with difficulties. Only with the great leap forward in production under the People's Commune, which allows for unified arrangement of labor and individual lives, and the practice of communist collaboration between communes, counties, and provinces, can such a great project be carried out smoothly and rapidly.

The 80,000 laborers on the construction site came from the People's Communes of four counties: Wujiang, Wuxian, Jiangyin, and Changshu. Each commune sent its young and strong members to the front lines of the river project, while the remaining members at home took full responsibility for production in the rear. They also constantly organized慰问 [comfort] groups to visit the front lines. Although the living conditions for the river workers at the construction site were quite good, with each person receiving 1.8 jin of rice and sufficient vegetables every day, and several meat dishes each month, each commune still sent thousands of jin of fish and meat to the construction site to support the workers, which greatly boosted their morale.

This project embodies the great role of urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture.

Since the start of construction in 1958, leaders and the masses have combined efforts to carry out technical innovations and minimize heavy physical labor. Now,土運 [earth transport] tools are motorized, vehicle bearings are轴承化 [bearing-ized],轨道化 [railroad-ized],坡度绞关化 [incline winch-ized], and倒土 [dumping earth] tools are automated, with progress being made towards mechanized and electrified construction. The components for these tools and machines, such as iron rails, are mainly supplied by Suzhou factories. The secretaries of these factories have taken the lead in ensuring the successful support of the Taipu River project. Workers in some factories sacrificed their Spring Festival holidays to rush production of tools, and even mobilized their families to help. These noble actions greatly moved the laborers and further boosted their enthusiasm.

This project embodies the decisive role of putting politics in command and grasping political and ideological education, as well as leadership taking the lead.

When the laborers were being organized in each county, ideological education was conducted in advance. The organization of the Jiangyin and Changshu teams, for example, was like mobilizing for military service during wartime. After ideological mobilization, people volunteered, leaders reviewed, and the masses cheered them on, so the laborers were in high spirits when they went to the front lines. After arriving at the construction site, the project headquarters put forward different combat slogans based on different stages to continuously push the mass movement to new climaxes. As soon as construction began, the slogans were "Good Start" and "Three Seizures"—seize the start of work, seize action (start digging as soon as you put down your luggage), and seize arrangements (get assigned to arduous positions). Then, the slogan for the first battle was: "Plant Red Flags, Establish Pace-setters." The headquarters convened a大会 [general meeting] and held a solemn ceremony to congratulate the pace-setter battalions, calling on everyone to learn from them. The slogan for the second battle was "Dig the Riverbed, Compete for the Championship." The slogan for the third battle was "Full-Line Grand Competition, Three Seizures to Win the Championship."

The laborers on the entire line were organized like troops, in squads, platoons, companies, and battalions. Cadres at all levels ate, lived, and worked alongside the laborers. Squad and platoon cadres were required to work the same as the laborers; battalion and regimental cadres worked half a day and did work-related tasks for the other half, so that cadres and laborers were integrated.

Under the education, leadership, and care of the Party organizations at all levels of the project headquarters, and with the support and encouragement of their respective communes, the laborers on the entire line were truly spirited and full of energy. When you go to the construction site, you only see colorful flags fluttering all over the fields, various earth-transport vehicles being pulled by machines and rushing by, and the rumbling of various machines emanating from草棚 [grass sheds], from high slopes, and from洼地 [low-lying areas]. The laborers have rosy complexions and radiant faces, competing and challenging each other. A March 8th Women's Platoon, flying a large red flag, was challenging the male workers in neighboring platoons.

It must be said that the work here is still quite arduous. This is mainly because in February and March this year, there were continuous spring rains, with few days without rain. In southern Jiangsu, the soil becomes extremely slippery when it rains, the mud sticks to the tools, reducing work efficiency, and some advanced tools are unable to exert their power. However, the laborers did not succumb to the difficulties. They "seized sunny days, rushed on cloudy days, treated light rain as no rain, and refused to leave the front lines even in heavy rain." The project leaders forbade them from working night shifts, but in order to take advantage of good weather, they often secretly worked at night. Many theatrical troupes from all over the province came to the construction site to perform慰问 [consolation] performances, which the laborers loved to watch, but when there were days without rain, the laborers preferred not to watch the show and secretly went to work night shifts, refusing even when the leaders tried to persuade them to watch. The actors, seeing the laborers' great enthusiasm, gave up performing and automatically went to dig and carry earth.

This kind of selfless labor enthusiasm of the broad masses provides a very vivid socialist and communist education. There is a line in Chairman Mao's poem: "Six hundred million people, all sages and heroes." We can better appreciate the profound significance of our great leader's enthusiastic praise of the working people through concrete examples.

Finally, I want to mention that at the Taipu River project, a village site from primitive society was discovered. This area was a swamp in ancient times, and the people of the primitive era built their dwellings on the damp land. The remains of their dwellings still exist. They mainly relied on fishing and hunting for a living, and the large amounts of clam and mussel shells left over from eating were used as the main material for鋪墊 [paving] the ground of their dwellings, and discarded deer antlers and animal bones were everywhere. This discovery is quite important for studying the lives of primitive humans around Taihu Lake and the ancient history of Jiangsu. When the site was discovered, the project headquarters attached great importance to it, immediately notified the relevant departments by long-distance telephone, and transferred the laborers away from the area to preserve the site for us archaeologists to excavate carefully. During the excavation process, we closely relied on the project leaders and received their meticulous care and maximum support. By publicizing the importance of this work to the laborers, they understood its importance and gradually became able to distinguish what was important among the things unearthed, and actively handed over the unearthed文物 [cultural relics] to us. Through this work, we have further realized that economic construction drives scientific and cultural work, and we have also further realized that scientific and cultural work can only be done well by relying on the leadership of the Party and the masses.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our people are creating unprecedented and earth-shattering undertakings with incomparable ambition, and are marching towards communism along the socialist road with magnificent strides. We scientific and cultural workers feel honored and proud to be born in this era and to stand in our own positions. Only by diligently studying Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly transforming ourselves, and establishing and consolidating the proletarian worldview, can we keep pace with the workers and peasants, advance side by side, and make brilliant contributions to the great construction of our motherland.

### 跃进热潮满太浦  曾昭燏委员的发言

专栏：

    跃进热潮满太浦
    曾昭燏委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，并为我国人民这一年来，在党和毛主席的领导下，在经济建设与文化建设上取得巨大的胜利而感到极端的兴奋。
    在全国社会主义建设事业的各条战线上，有数不清说不完的、表现着新社会崭新面貌的、感动人的事迹，给人以深刻的教育。我这里只举一个例子来谈谈。
    我在今年3月间，在江苏省苏州专区太浦河工地上住了几日。太浦河是一条正在开凿的连接太湖与黄浦江的河，全长五十七点二公里，河底宽一百五十米，河面宽一百八十米。这河凿成，可根治太湖流域的水患，便利农田灌溉，并使三四千吨巨轮可从上海港直驶入太湖。这工程从1958年11月开始，1959年5月第一期工程结束。今年春天进入第二期工程，苏州专区有八万民工投入专区内的工段上，这一段的土方工程现在已接近完成。
    从几天所看到、听到的，我体会出几点：
    这工程体现出人民公社的优越性苏南地区素来是田畴开辟，人烟稠密。现在要开凿这样一条大河，在河道及两旁堤岸所经过的地方，无疑有大面积的农田和许多村庄要挖掉，有成千上万的人要迁居，这不要说在各个农户单干的情况下，很难办到，就是在高级农业生产合作社组织形势之下，也是困难重重的。只有在有了人民公社生产大跃进的情况之下，能够统一安排劳动力，统一安排各个人的生活，公社与公社之间、县与县之间、省与省之间搞共产主义大协作，才能使这样一项伟大的工程顺利地、飞速地进行。
    在工地上的八万民工，是从吴江、吴县、江阴、常熟四个县的人民公社组织来的。各个公社把自己社里年轻力壮的社员送到河工前线，后方的生产，由留在家里的社员完全担负起来，还不断组织慰问团到前线去慰问。尽管开河的民工们在工地的生活相当好，每天有一斤十二两大米和充足的蔬菜，每月吃几次鱼肉荤菜，但各个公社还是几千斤鱼、几千斤肉的送到工地来劳军，这样大大地鼓舞了民工们的斗志。
    这工程体现出城市支援农村、工业支援农业的巨大作用
    从1958年开工时起，在施工过程中，领导与群众相结合，大搞技术革新，尽量减轻繁重的体力劳动，现在已做到运土工具车子化，车辆轴承化、轨道化，坡度绞关化，倒土工具自动化，并向机械化、电气化施工进军。这些工具的构件和机器、铁轨等，主要是由苏州工厂供给的。这些工厂都由书记挂帅，保证做好支援太浦河工程的工作，有的工厂的工人牺牲了春节的假期来赶制工具，还动员自己的家属来做。这种高尚的行为，使民工们大受感动，更加鼓足了干劲。
    这工程体现出政治挂帅、抓紧政治思想教育与领导带头的决定性的作用
    在各个县组织民工的时候，事先都做了一番思想教育工作，像江阴、常熟两个团的组织，如同战争时动员参军一样，经过思想动员，自动报名，领导审查，群众欢送，因之民工们斗志昂扬，奔赴前线。到了工地以后，工程指挥部根据不同的阶段提出不同的战斗口号，使群众运动不断进入新的高潮。才一开工，便提出“开门红”和“三抢”——抢开工、抢行动（身上的行李一放下便去挖土）、抢安排（安排到艰苦的岗位上去）。接着第一个战役，提出的口号是：“插红旗，树标兵。”指挥部召集大会，用庄严隆重的仪式向标兵营贺喜，号召大家向标兵营看齐。第二个战役的口号是“挖河底，抢冠军”。第三个战役的口号是“全线大比武，三抢夺冠军”。
    全线的民工是像部队一样，按排、连、营、团组织的。各级干部都同民工同吃、同住、同劳动，排和连的干部劳动，要求同民工一样；营和团的干部半天劳动，半天搞工作，这样干部同民工打成一片。
    全线民工在工程指挥部各级党组织的教育、领导与关怀下，在自己所属的公社的支持与鼓舞下，真是意气风发，干劲冲天。你到工地上一看，只看到各色彩旗，飘扬遍野，各种运土车子，被机器牵引着在飞奔，各种机器的轰鸣声，从草棚里，从高坡上，从洼地中，隆隆地发出来。民工们面色红润，容光焕发，在互相比赛、挑战。有个三八妇女排，树立着一面大红旗，在和邻近几排的男工们挑战。
    必须说，在这里劳动还是相当艰苦的。主要因为今年二三月，春雨连绵，难得几个不下雨的天，苏南土地，一下雨便泥滑异常，泥土粘着工具，工效便减低，有的先进工具甚至无所施其威力。但民工们不在困难面前屈服，他们“抢晴天，赶阴天，小雨只当无雨天，大雨也不肯下火线。”工程领导上是禁止他们开夜工的，但他们为着抢好天气，往往在夜间偷着干。全省各地有好些剧团到工地来作慰问演出，民工们非常爱看，但遇着不下雨的天，民工们情愿不看戏，偷着去开夜工，领导上劝他们去看也不肯。演员看到民工干劲这样大，便放弃演出，自动跑去挖土和挑土。
    广大群众的这种忘我的劳动热情，给人以一种极生动的社会主义、共产主义教育。毛主席诗中有一句：“六亿神州尽舜尧”。我们伟大的领袖对劳动人民这样热情的歌颂，其深刻意义，我们从具体事例中更能体会出来。
    最后我要谈到的是：在太浦河工程中，发现了一处原始社会的村落遗址。这里在古代是个沼泽地带，原始时代的人们在潮湿的土地上建造了他们的住处，他们居住的遗迹还存在。他们主要靠渔猎为生，吃剩下来的大量的蛤蜊壳与蚌壳用作铺垫居住地面的主要材料，抛弃的鹿角、兽骨，遍地皆是。这一发现对研究太湖周围原始时代人类的生活和江苏古代历史是相当重要的。当遗址发现时，工程指挥部非常重视，立即以长途电话通知有关部门，并把民工调离这块地方，保留这处遗址，让我们考古工作者作仔细的发掘。在发掘进程中，我们紧密地依靠着工程领导，获得领导上无微不至的关怀与最大的支持。由于向民工群众进行了宣传，民工们懂得这工作的重要性，也逐渐能够辨别出土的东西什么是重要的，掘出来古物，便主动地交给我们。通过这次工作，我们更深地体会到经济建设带动了科学文化工作，也更深地体会到搞科学文化工作，只有依靠党的领导，依靠群众，才能做得好。
    我们全国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，正以无比的雄心壮志，创造史无前例的惊天动地的事业，以雄伟的步伐，沿着社会主义的道路向共产主义迈进。我们科学文化工作者，以生在这个时代、站在自己这个岗位上而感到光荣与自豪。我们只有努力认真学习马列主义，特别是学习毛主席的著作，彻底改造自己，建立和巩固无产阶级的人生观，才有可能和工农群众同一步伐，并肩前进，为祖国的伟大建设作出光辉的贡献。（附图片）
