Presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will report to the congress on the progress of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation (hereinafter referred to as "four modernizations") in Heilongjiang Province.

Our province's technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" started in October last year, building on the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution of the past few years. In just a few months, this movement spread rapidly across the province like wildfire, forming a nationwide technical revolution. From leaders to the masses, from cities to villages, from industry and agriculture to all walks of life, from large and medium-sized enterprises to small enterprises, everyone is enthusiastically engaged in the technical revolution. As of the end of March, the province had thirteen remote-controlled factories, one hundred and twenty-six remote-controlled sections, stations, and offices, eighty-one automated factories, three hundred and eighteen automated workshops, two thousand eight hundred and seventy-five mechanized factories, five thousand five hundred and eighty-four mechanized workshops, three thousand nine hundred and sixteen automated production lines, eleven thousand seven hundred and sixty-six automated single machines, three thousand four hundred and sixty-five old belt lathes改造, and thirty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety mechanized manual operations. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of large and small industrial enterprises in the province has increased from 38.2% at the beginning of this year to 75.7%, with Harbin reaching over 80%, Qiqihar and Mudanjiang reaching over 90%, and Shuangcheng, Zhaodong, and Acheng counties also reaching over 90%. Currently, our province's technical innovation and technical revolution movement is advancing along the correct, scientific, and mass track pointed out by the Party Central Committee. From the perspective of our province, the characteristics of this movement are:

Four Characteristics of the Technical Revolution Movement in Heilongjiang Province

First, rapid development, great momentum, widespread and in-depth.

The scale of the movement is no less than the nationwide steelmaking movement of 1958. Once the movement started, it quickly penetrated every corner of the province, mobilizing all walks of life. Factory workers have created various remote control, telemetry, and telecommunication equipment, automated production lines, automated single machines, and transformed manual operations into mechanization; construction workers have created new equipment such as concrete automatic lines, plastering automatic lines, and modular bricklaying machines; transportation workers have created mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment for moving, transporting, loading, and unloading; farmers have created new machines such as planting machines, integrated tillage machines, double-ridge universal cultivators, simple tractors, automatic lines for one person to raise ten thousand chickens, automatic lines for one person to raise three thousand pigs; salespersons have created automatic vending machines, bank employees have invented money counting machines, street police stations have created local telephone conference equipment; firefighters have created "twenty-three automatics" for fire truck dispatching, which, in the event of a fire, can simultaneously trigger twenty-three actions in an instant, such as the bell ringing automatically, the lights turning on automatically, the door opening automatically, and the truck leaving automatically, greatly shortening the time for dispatching fire trucks; catering service personnel have created automatic dumpling making lines, vegetable cutting machines, steamed bun machines, and窩頭machines, enabling many canteens to realize "no need to use hands for cutting vegetables, no need to walk to deliver food, no need to knead dough, everything is done by pressing a button"; the laundry and dyeing industry has achieved mechanization, steam-power, and chemicalization of washing, brushing, dyeing, and ironing, with one person able to wash four thousand five hundred pieces of clothing a day; workers making tofu have created an automatic tofu production line, producing one thousand four hundred boards of tofu a day; bathhouse service personnel have created back-scrubbing machines, and nursery school nannies have created automatic urine detectors for children, with a red light turning on as soon as a child urinates. This shows how deep and wide the development of the movement is.

Second, it has created a good start for the comprehensive technical transformation of the national economy.

The in-depth development of the movement is causing a fundamental change in the production technology of major sectors of our province's national economy, such as industry and agriculture. In a short period of time, in the industrial sector alone, over 300,000 people in the province have been freed from heavy manual labor, achieved mechanization of manual operations, and some have even ridden on the horses of automation and remote control. The movement has given old factories a new look, and new factories are developing in a newer and more advanced direction. For example, the flax factory is a completely new factory, and after realizing six automatic production lines for combing, drawing, etc., the entire factory can save more than 3,000 square meters of building area, and the entire original bleaching workshop can be eliminated. The Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory is also a brand-new factory, and the original flexible shaft production workshop with forty-two workers has been completely replaced by an automatic line operated by two people. The modern equipment of the Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, after changing the original production process of taps to an automated production line, has reduced the man-hours for each tap from forty-eight seconds to six seconds, the equipment from fifteen units to ten units, the production area occupied from one hundred and fifty square meters to one hundred square meters, the number of workers from sixteen to three, and the annual output has increased from 330,000 pieces to 2.7 million pieces, with labor productivity increasing twelvefold. In old and small factories, such as the bristle factory, the old method of processing bristles with teeth and hands for a century has ended, which not only greatly improves production efficiency and reduces the number of workers from five hundred and thirty to one hundred and eighty, but also fundamentally solves the threat of serious occupational diseases such as tooth loss and hand numbness for workers. The Jincheng Hardware Factory was originally a district-run factory with extremely simple equipment. In January of this year, it "leapt to the sky" and transformed the manual labor production of products such as thimbles and hairpins into automation, and now it has achieved remote control.

The technical revolution centered on "four modernizations" not only fundamentally changed the condition of various production equipment, but also promoted the comprehensive development of technology. In terms of power supply, there has been a major reform in the area of ring unified power supply, breaking the past "one household, one stove" power supply system, greatly saving electrical materials, and tapping the potential of electricity. In the machinery industry, new technologies such as chipless processing (in Harbin alone, chipless processing has been realized in two hundred and nineteen products and six thousand parts), steam-protected welding (without welding rods and welding flux), and single-layer steel plate manufacturing of離壓vessels (production cycle reduced from sixty days to ten days) have emerged. In the textile industry, there has been a new technology of spinning raw wool directly into fine thread without coarse spinning. In the forestry industry, new tools for collecting materials in the mountains have been created, so that "horse 套子" are no longer used in the vast majority of forest areas; in the coal industry, electric universal tunneling machines have been created, which can drill holes, load vehicles, and transport materials on the tunneling face, increasing efficiency by one time compared with pneumatic tools. In terms of railway transportation, specialized lines are being transformed throughout the province, loading and unloading trains are being organized into convoys, and direct trains are being organized in order to greatly save station stopping time and improve transportation efficiency. In medicine, the latest technological experiments such as dog head transplantation and artificial liver have been successfully carried out.

Third, the close combination of production practice and scientific research.

The various technological achievements achieved in this movement are based on Chairman Mao's instructions on combining daring to think and act with scientific analysis, and based on the practical experience of technical revolution in the past two years and their own specific conditions, created in a pragmatic way. Therefore, they are all in line with the objective laws of science. The tens of thousands of new technologies created in the movement were not arranged in advance by a specialized design department, but were created by the broad masses on the basis of the original equipment, according to the needs of production, and by summarizing the daily production experience with scientific analysis methods. For example, in order to solve the mechanization and automation of bristle processing, bristle workers needed to design a device that could adjust a pile of messy bristles so that the roots faced down and the tips faced up, and bundle them neatly according to different sizes. Without technical data or engineers, they relied on the leadership of the Party and launched a movement in which everyone contributed ideas, and more than one hundred models and design drawings were put forward within a few days. Based on decades of operating experience, they imitated the movements of their hands and made a machine that constantly shook the bristles to both sides, and as a result, the bristles were obediently divided into different sizes with the tips facing up and the roots facing down, and were bundled up. Even those specialized mechanical designers were amazed when they saw this equipment, believing that it was truly "ingenious." Facts once again prove that science and technology are the summary of labor practice.

This movement is also a mass scientific research movement on a huge scale. Many major technological reforms are not only of great practical significance in production, but some also have important technical and theoretical significance. For example, workers at the Xinfeng Processing Plant have already written more than 230 scientific and technical papers. Some workers have persisted in making detailed production records for hundreds of days, and have put forward opinions of great scientific value.

In the movement, many universities and scientific research institutions were also involved. Many professors, students, and scientific researchers moved their beds to the workshops and fought alongside the workers, so that production practice promoted scientific research, and the latest achievements of scientific research could quickly go into production practice. The Welding Research Institute cooperated with the famous welding worker Liang Yande to quickly apply steam-protected welding, which was only recently available in the laboratory, to production practice. Teachers and students of the Architectural College and workers of the Railway Locomotive Depot used the latest scientific achievements to create "smokeless locomotives," and medical universities also sent a large number of teachers and students to factories and construction sites to study the new changes that have taken place in industrial hygiene after mechanization and automation.

Fourth, this technical innovation and technical revolution movement is closely integrated with the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, the mass cultural revolution movement, the mass reform of old lifestyles, and the mass movement of comprehensively organizing people's economic and cultural lives.

These four mass movements, led by the study of Mao Zedong Thought and centered on the development of production, are tightly interwoven, conditional on each other, promote each other, and converge into a huge revolutionary torrent. This torrent has given people's mental outlook a new look, created enormous material wealth for socialist construction, thereby promoting the technical transformation of the entire national economy and promoting the great leap forward in production. It has made all aspects of socialist construction present a situation of making progress every day. This is also the huge driving force that enables this technical innovation and technical revolution movement to sweep the province rapidly with overwhelming momentum. The close integration of the four major movements is not only a prominent feature of this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, but also a prominent feature of the entry of our province's socialist revolution and socialist construction into a new stage.

As a result of carrying out the technical revolution movement, productivity has been greatly developed, labor productivity has been improved, labor conditions have been changed, and product costs have been reduced. In February, the industrial labor productivity of our province increased by 84% compared with the same period last year, and the first quarter industrial production plan was completed half a month ahead of schedule. The broad masses of workers and staff members have been freed from years of heavy manual labor and have achieved a great leap forward in production. They are truly happy and smiling. Workers of the Xiangfang Timber Processing Plant in Harbin wrote a song: "In the past, in the log yard, loading and unloading relied on shoulders; carrying wood required shouting, and sweat covered the face; unloading wood required pulling ropes, and there was no guarantee of time; the back ached and the muscles hurt, and injuries could occur if you missed a step. Now in the log yard, everything has changed completely; shouts are not heard, only the sound of machines is heard; unloading trucks is done with '崩子', and efficiency is doubled; shoulders can unload thousands of pounds, and safety is guaranteed; living to ninety, the whole family is happy; full of energy, throat itchy; singing of Chairman Mao, grateful to the Communist Party." Workers of the Zhaodong County Fur Factory said: "In the past, cutting leather was tiring and back-breaking, and even a strong man could only last for half a day; discarding the big shovel and mechanizing, product leaps triple." Workers in Mudanjiang City said: "Breaking a drum in two days, breaking a gong in three days, not because the quality of the gongs and drums is poor, but because there are too many reports of victory."

This movement not only made production and construction achieve a sustained great leap forward, but more importantly, it opened up a road to realize production mechanization and automation at the speed of the great leap forward. Numerous facts show that not only can the speed of the great leap forward be achieved in socialist construction, but also the speed of the great leap forward can be achieved in technological development.

The countless facts of our province's technical innovation and technical revolution movement show that thoroughly changing the backward face of technology, realizing the great historical task of technical revolution put forward by the Eighth Party Congress, and building our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible is the urgent desire of our people. Once this desire is enlightened by Mao Zedong Thought and people's subjective initiative is fully developed, it can create infinite and amazing miracles. Therefore, we have always paid attention to taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology, giving full play to the subjective initiative of the people, and combining it with the needs of production development to carry out a nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations." Now, I will introduce our main specific practices as follows:

Specific Practices and Some Experiences

First, eliminate the sense of mystery about mechanization, automation, and various new technologies, and realize the continuous revolution of technology.

Facts have proved that anyone who earnestly follows Chairman Mao's instructions on combining daring to think and act with scientific analysis and the theory of continuous revolution has achieved victory in the technical revolution. The development process of this movement is also a process of breaking the sense of mystery about mechanization, automation, and new technologies. Although our province had already broken people's superstition about steelmaking in the mass steelmaking movement in 1958, people still considered mechanization and automation to be very mysterious a few months ago. Some people in new enterprises said: "Our enterprise is a world-class new enterprise, and a higher degree of mechanization and automation does not exist abroad. Can we make it?" Some people in old and small enterprises said: "Our enterprise is old and small, and it cannot compare with new enterprises. A phoenix cannot come out of a chicken coop. How can we achieve mechanization and automation?" In response to this situation, we used Chairman Mao's teachings on breaking superstition and emancipating the mind to educate the broad masses of people, and encouraged everyone to dare to think and act, and to be brave in invention and creation. As a result, this sense of mystery was quickly broken, and things immediately changed. In a short period of a few months, tens of thousands of mechanization and automation innovations and creations emerged. The first batch of automatic lines in Harbin, the tap automatic line, took eight months to make because some people's minds contained right-leaning conservative ideas and feelings of inferiority, and several attempts were made to "slow down" and "dismount." After the right-leaning conservative ideology and sense of mystery were broken, the development speed of the city's technical revolution movement became faster and faster. From October last year to March 12 this year, seven hundred and ten automatic lines and two thousand five hundred and seventy-six automated single machines appeared in four and a half months. And from March 12 to the end of March, in the nineteen days, there were eight hundred and fifty-six automatic lines and five thousand and fifty-eight automated single machines.

In the past, many people believed that county-run industries did not have the conditions to vigorously promote mechanization and automation. However, after earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to think and act, breaking superstitions, and continuously revolutionizing, the situation has completely changed. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of many county-run industries in our province has reached more than 90%. For example, Zhaodong County, as of March 20, had realized three hundred and ninety mechanized manual operations, and thirty-four automatic production lines had appeared, and one hundred and twenty factories had achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.

The factories are still those factories, the people are still those people, and the material conditions are basically the same, but because people used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and gradually grasped the objective laws of science, things have greatly changed.

Second, conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs," combining foreign and indigenous methods, and relying on self-reliance.

Such a comprehensive technical transformation movement with such a rapid development speed and unprecedented scale would be fundamentally inconceivable if it were entirely reliant on asking the state for investment and equipment. Therefore, from the beginning of the movement, we have paid attention to overcoming the idea of ​​valuing foreign methods over indigenous methods, and resolutely implemented the policy of walking on two legs, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and relying on self-reliance, as instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Because only in this way can every corner and industry in the province be able to combine their own specific conditions with the needs of production to achieve self-reliance. If you can use foreign methods, you should, and if you can't, use indigenous methods, so that everyone can do it and get things going everywhere to make the movement a national one. Therefore, in leading the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, on the one hand, we focused on creating advanced automation and high, large, precise, sharp, and new products such as remote control, telemetry, and telecommunications; at the same time, we also focused on simple technical innovations. For example, there are two ways to convert existing machine tools into automation: one is to use high-grade electrical components to control them, such as magnetic tape recorder type and photoelectric control program-controlled machine tools; the other is to use simple cams and spring brakes, such as mechanical linkage automated machine tools. In the movement, the development of cutting-edge technology also takes two approaches: using both foreign and indigenous methods. For example, the "three-izations and four-degrees" ("three-izations" refers to multi-purpose, automated operation, and component generalization; "four-degrees" refers to the good speed, accuracy, rigidity, and reasonable tool angle of machine tools) of the new type of building block machine created by the Harbin Ji Lian Machinery Factory under extremely simple conditions, the extremely simple and quite reasonable warm air furnace created in Harbin that can replace the heating system, and the bristle processing machine created by the Harbin Bristle Factory are all excellent examples of "using indigenous methods to engage in cutting-edge technology, and producing phoenixes from chicken coops."

Countless facts show that only by combining foreign and indigenous methods and walking on two legs can there be a vigorous mass movement, can there be both popularization and improvement, can there be a great leap forward speed in improving technology, and can there be a great leap forward speed in the development of the entire national economy. This is a truth. This truth is a new weapon that Chairman Mao has added to Marxist-Leninist political economy.

Third, adhere to the working method of the mass line and vigorously engage in "production sports meets."

As everyone knows, the mass line is an important component of Mao Zedong Thought and is also the fundamental line of our Party in leading the cause of revolution and construction. Relying on the masses and engaging in mass movements on a large scale is the basic method we use to lead the continuous advancement of the cause of revolution and construction. In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, while constantly strengthening the Party's leadership, we paid special attention to relying on the masses and fully mobilizing the strength of the masses to engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. In the movement, the staff and workers of our province created a new form of competition that is popular with the masses, called "production sports meet." This competition process is modeled after the practice of sports meets that the masses are very familiar with. Competition events are arranged according to the needs of production development; staff and workers are organized to conduct technical training around the competition events, learn from each other, and prepare for the competition; technical demonstrations are held and selected at all levels (champion, runner-up, third place); good experiences in the competition are summarized and packaged; various methods such as promotion teams and large performances are used to promote good experiences. This competition is divided into two types: individual and all-around. It can be carried out within an enterprise, or in a region or an enterprise. This competition form has many advantages: because of the selection at all levels, people chase each other, greatly mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the masses; because it is centered on technological innovation, combining economic indicators with technical competitions, it effectively gives play to the wisdom and talent of the masses, and summarizes and promotes advanced experiences; because it combines invention and creation with learning and promotion, it truly reflects the principle of socialist competition to help each other and improve together; at the same time, because the "sports meet" is held in sessions, it also meets the requirements of combining work and rest.

This competition form has now been widely used in our province. Since the beginning of this year, Qiqihar City has held a city-wide competition for renovating cutting tools, the "Blade Competition," and a competition for casting technology, the "Mould Competition." In a very short period of time, one thousand one hundred and ninety-six sets of new moulds have emerged, greatly increasing casting production capacity. Harbin City held two city-wide production sports meets in January and March. In the "January Good Start" sports meet in Harbin, 66,300 champions and runners-up emerged, of which 40,000 completed two to ten or more days of work in one day. Twenty-two thousand rationalization proposals, eighty-seven automated production lines, three hundred and twenty automated single machines, and one thousand nine hundred mechanized manual operations emerged. It can be seen that the "production sports meet" is one of the very good competition forms for us to fully mobilize the masses and implement the mass line.

Fourth, vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation

In the movement, we often pay attention to educating the broad masses with Chairman Mao's instructions on putting politics in command and promoting the communist style of cooperation, and universally promote the experience of "three-in-one combination" inside and outside the enterprise, which has powerfully promoted the rapid progress of the technical revolution. Facts have also proved that most major creations are the products of communist cooperation. For example, the first automatic production line in our province, the tap automatic production line, is the product of the cooperation between the Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory and the Tool Research Institute; the new technology experimental building that does not use steel bars, wood, bricks, tiles, or cement is the product of the cooperation between the Harbin Construction Engineering Company and the Civil Engineering Research Institute and other units; the new "building block" machine tool is the product of the cooperation between the Harbin Machine Association Machinery Factory and the Harbin University of Technology. The "four-in-one" ring power supply experience that emerged in our province last year is also a product of communist cooperation.

This communist cooperation has organized the staff and workers and masses on the industrial, agricultural, transportation, cultural and educational, financial and trade, and other fronts of our province. In the process of the technical revolution, when a difficulty is encountered in one place, all places come to support it. University professors, university students, and scientific researchers go to workshops and construction sites to support the technical innovation of workers; workers not only make a great technical revolution in the factory, but also form cooperation teams and take the initiative to support the technical innovation of agriculture and shops. All technical innovation projects are both yours and mine, and everyone is honored by a successful event. It can be seen from this that the technical revolution can not only create infinite material wealth economically, but also sweep away the selfish, conservative, and backward old ideas and habits left over from the old society, thereby establishing a noble communist moral fashion and greatly changing people's mental outlook.

Fifth, adapt to the requirements of technological development and continuously improve enterprise management.

Chairman Mao often taught us that the relations of production must adapt to the development of productive forces, and in leading work, we must always pay attention to adjusting the new contradictions that constantly arise between them in order to promote the continuous and rapid development of productive forces. The comprehensive development of the technical revolution movement has greatly improved the productive forces, and many original management organizations, management systems, and management tools have gradually become incompatible with the requirements of productive force development. Therefore, we must: in terms of planning management, require the preparation of plans and preparation of materials based on the high-efficiency production of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; in terms of labor and wage management, require timely changes in labor organization, effective use of labor, and reasonable solutions to the wage and bonus issues brought about by technological innovation; in terms of financial management, require timely improvement of accounting and statistical work so that technological innovation can create the greatest economic results; in terms of technical management, require the revision of regulations and systems that cannot adapt to the requirements of "four modernizations"; in terms of the internal system of enterprises, require that the organizational form of management be suitable for the new situation of "four modernizations."

With the rapid progress of the technical revolution, new changes are also taking place in our province's enterprise management. Some enterprises have greatly changed their original management organizations and labor organizations. For example, after the flexible shaft production workshop of the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory was fully automated, it has been changed from a workshop to a work section, and from a work section to an automatic production line directly under the factory department. This line is operated by two people, who are both managers and producers. The work of many enterprises' departments has also been reformed. The First Engineering Company of Qiqihar City, in one month, summarized the experience of thirteen departments and formulated thirteen sets of rules and regulations and seventy-seven new working methods to adapt to the new situation.

Just as space rockets cannot calculate mileage with manual calculation tools, old management tools can no longer adapt to the high-efficiency production of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. For example, a high-efficiency automatic line can produce thousands or even tens of thousands of finished products per hour. If the number of finished products is still calculated one by one by hand, or if people are used to report various production situations, it is obviously very unsuitable for production needs. Therefore, a revolution in management tools is now underway in our province. In January and February of this year, Mudanjiang City created 246 types of quick calculation tools and electrified and automated management tools with a total of more than 7,500 pieces. Harbin has seen 254 management accounting assembly lines and more than 7,400 types of accounting tools. Among them are advanced electrical instrument control automation equipment, as well as simple automatic weighing, measuring, and recording instruments. Economic indicators that used to take a day and a night to calculate can now be known within an hour. Workers described it as: "No need to report with your mouth, no need to walk to transmit, no need to draw cards, no need to stamp with your hand." These reforms in management tools have not only greatly improved the efficiency of management work, but also further adapted to the development requirements of production and technology, and have created more favorable conditions for workers to participate in management.

With the deepening development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the system of worker participation in management has also been newly developed. Workers have not only participated in production management and technical management, but also in scientific research; many textile workers have become new designers and manufacturers of textile machinery; many workers who operate machinery have become creators of new machinery; many advanced technical innovators have enjoyed a high reputation among the broad masses, and some are called "wise men," some are called "living keys," "living immortals," and some are called "universal stoves." Red experts from the working class have emerged in batches. It can be fully foreseen that this movement will train thousands of new red experts for the cause of socialist construction in our country.

In addition, there are some other practices, such as the need to vigorously cultivate and support new things; formulate a comprehensive plan for the technical revolution, and according to the plan, engage in battles, carry out phased assaults, and while vigorously engaging in the technical revolution, vigorously engage in the cultural revolution.

The reason why our province has been able to make relatively rapid progress and achieve certain results in this technical revolution movement is the great victory of the Party's leadership, the mass line, and the "three magic weapons." And the Party's leadership of the mass line, the "three magic weapons" are again a part of Chairman Mao's important creative development of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, in the final analysis, these victories are the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the technical revolution movement.

Although we have achieved certain results in leading and carrying out this movement, we are still far from the needs, the development of the movement is not balanced enough, the summary and dissemination of experience is not timely and systematic, and there are still some shortcomings and problems in our work. In order to do a better job in the technical revolution movement and all our work in the future, we must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, establish great ambitions, strengthen leadership, and make comprehensive plans, so as to lead this national technical revolution movement from a climax to a higher climax, and from victory to greater victory.

I wish the congress a successful success!

    运动的规模比1958年全民大炼钢铁运动有过之而无不及。运动一开展起来，很快就深入到全省各个角落，动员了各行各业。工厂工人创造了各种各样的遥控遥测遥讯设备、自动化生产线、自动化单机和变手工操作为机械化；基本建设工人创制了混凝土自动线、抹灰自动线、模式砌砖机等新设备；交通运输工人创制了搬、运、装、卸机械化、半机械化的设备；农民创制了刨埯机、综合整地机、双垅万能?耙、简易拖拉机、一人养万鸡的自动线、一人养三千头猪的自动线等各种新式机械；售货员创制了自动售货机，银行职工发明了点钞机，街道派出所创制了土电话会议设备；消防人员在出车救火上创制了“二十三自动”，一旦发生火警，在刹那间，可以使铃自响，灯自亮，门自开，车自出等二十三种动作一齐开始，大大地缩短了出车救火的时间；饮食服务人员创制了包饺子自动线、切菜机、馒头机、窝头机，使许多食堂实现了“切菜不用手，送饭不用走，合面不用揉，一切按电钮”；洗染行业作到了洗、刷、染、烫的机械化、蒸气化、化学化，一个人一天能洗四千五百件衣服；作豆腐的工人创制了豆腐自动生产线，日产豆腐一千四百板；浴池服务人员制成了擦背机，保育院的阿姨创制了小孩自动报尿器，孩子一撒尿，红灯就亮了。由此可见，运动的发展是多么深广。
    第二，为国民经济全面技术改造创立了良好开端。
    运动的深入发展，正使我省工农业等国民经济主要部门的生产技术面貌经历着一个根本变化。在短短的时间内，仅仅在工业方面，全省就已有三十余万人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，实现了手工操作机械化，有些甚至已经骑上了自动化和遥控的骏马。运动使老厂换上了新装，新厂向着更新和更高级方向发展。例如：亚麻厂是一个全新的工厂，在实现了梳麻、并条等六条自动生产线后，全厂可以节约三千多平方米的建筑面积，原有的整个漂洗车间可以不要了。哈尔滨电表仪器厂，也是个全新的厂子，原有四十二个工人的软轴生产车间已经被两个人操纵的一条自动线完全代替了。现代化设备的哈尔滨量具刃具厂，在把原有生产丝锥生产过程改为自动化生产线后，就使每件丝锥生产的工时，由四十八秒减为六秒，设备由十五台减为十台，占用生产面积由一百五十平方米减为一百平方米，十六个工人减为三人，而年产量却由三十三万件上升为二百七十万件，劳动生产率提高十二倍。在旧厂和小厂中如：猪鬃工厂结束了一个世纪以来用牙齿和手加工猪鬃的旧方法，不仅大大提高了生产效率，工人由五百三十人减为一百八十人，而且从根本上解决了工人齿落、手麻等严重职业病的威胁。金城五金厂原是一个设备极为简陋的区办工厂，今年1月份“一步登天”地把顶针、发卡等产品的手工劳动生产变成了自动化，现在又实现了遥控。
    以“四化”为中心的技术大革命，不仅从根本上改变了各种生产设备的状况，而且也推动了技术的全面发展。在供电方面，出现了地区环形统一供电的重大改革，打破了过去“一家一灶”的供电系统，大大节约了电气材料，挖掘了电力潜力。在机械工业中出现了无屑加工（仅哈尔滨市就已在二百一十九种产品六千种部件中实现无屑加工）、蒸气保护焊（不用焊条和焊药）、单层钢板制作离压容器（生产周期由六十天减为十天）等新技术，在纺织工业中出现了不经粗纺直接把原毛纺为精线的新技术。在森林工业方面。创造了山场集材新工具，可以在绝大多数林区不再使用“马套子”了；在煤炭工业方面，创造了电动万能掘进机，在掘进工作面里，可以打眼、装车、运输，比风动工具效率提高一倍。在铁路运输方面，正在全省范围改造专用线，组织成列装卸车，组织直达列车，以便大量节省站停时间，提高运输效率。在医学中成功地进行了移植狗头、人工肝等最新技术的试验。
    第三，生产实践与科学研究紧密结合。
    在这次运动中所取得的各种技术成果，都是根据毛主席关于敢想敢干与科学分析相结合的指示精神，根据两年来技术革命的实践经验和自己的具体情况，实事求是地创造出来的。因而也都是符合科学的客观规律的。运动中所创造出来的成千上万的新技术，并不是先有一个专门的设计部门替他们安排好了的，而是广大群众在原有设备的基础上，根据生产的需要，把日常生产实践经验用科学分析方法加以总结，创造出新的技术。比如：猪鬃工人为了解决猪鬃加工机械化、自动化，需要设计一种设备，能将一堆乱七八糟的猪鬃，都调整得根朝下，梢朝上，并按不同尺寸整整齐齐地分别捆扎起来。他们在一无技术资料，二无工程师的条件下，依靠党的领导，展开了人人献计的运动，几天之内就提出了一百多种模型和设计图纸。他们根据几十年的操作经验，模仿双手动作，做成一种机器，不断地把猪鬃向两边晃动，结果猪鬃就乖乖地一律梢朝上，根朝下地分成不同的尺寸，被捆扎起来了。这种设备，连那些专门的机械设计师们看了都咋起舌头，认为这真正是“巧夺天工”。事实再一次证明，科学技术乃是劳动实践的总结。
    这次运动同时也是一次规模巨大的群众性的科学研究运动。许多技术上的重大改革，不仅在生产上具有重大的现实意义，而且有的也具有重要技术理论意义。例如新风加工厂的工人已经写了二百三十多篇科学技术论文。有的工人坚持不懈地做了几百天的详细生产记录，提出了极有科学价值的意见。
    在运动中，许多大学、科学研究机关也都被卷入了。不少教授、学生、科学研究者把睡床搬到车间，和工人一起苦战，这样就使生产实践推动了科学研究，科学研究的最新成果又可以很快地走到生产实践中去。电焊研究所与著名电焊工人梁彦德一起合作把不久前还只在实验室中有过的蒸气保护焊很快地运用到了生产实践中去。建筑学院的师生和铁路机务段的工人一起采用最新科学成就制成了“无烟机车”，医科大学也派出了大批师生走到了工厂、工地，研究在机械化、自动化后工业卫生中所发生的新变化。
    第四，这次技术革新与技术革命运动，是与全民性的学习毛主席著作的运动，全民性的文化革命运动，全民性的改革旧的生活方式，全面组织人民经济和文化生活的群众运动紧密结合的。
    这四个全民性的群众运动，以学习毛泽东思想为帅，以发展生产为中心，紧紧地交织在一起，互为条件，互相促进，并且汇成了一股巨大的革命洪流。这股洪流使人们的精神面貌焕然一新，为社会主义建设创造了巨大的物质财富，从而推动了整个国民经济的技术改造，促进了生产的大跃进。它使社会主义建设的各个方面都呈现苟日新、日日新、又日新的局面。这也是这次技术革新和技术革命运动所以能够以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势，迅速席卷全省的巨大动力所在。四大运动的紧密结合，不仅是这次技术革新和技术革命运动的显著特点，而且也是我省社会主义革命和社会主义建设进入新阶段的一个突出特征。
    开展技术革命运动的结果，大大地发展了生产力，提高了劳动生产率，改变了劳动条件，降低了产品成本。2月份我省工业劳动生产率比去年同时期提高84％，提前半个月完成了第一季度工业生产计划。广大职工由于摆脱了多年的繁重手工劳动，获得了生产大跃进，真是心情舒畅、笑逐颜开。哈尔滨香坊木材加工厂的工人作歌一首：“过去原木场，装卸靠肩膀；抬木呼号叫，热汗满脸淌；卸木拉大绳，时间无保障；腰酸筋骨痛，失手就有伤。现在原木场，彻底变了样；号子听不见，但闻机器响；卸车有‘崩子’，效率成倍长；肩卸千斤载，安全把心放；高寿过九十，全家喜洋洋；精神爽，嗓子痒；歌唱毛主席，感谢共产党。”肇东县毛皮厂的工人说：“过去割皮累腰酸，好汉只能顶半天；扔掉大铲机械化，产品飞跃翻三番。”牡丹江市工人说：“两天打破一面鼓，三天敲破一面锣，不是锣鼓质量差，而是报捷事太多”。
    这次运动不仅使生产建设获得了持续大跃进，而且更重要的是开辟了一条以大跃进的速度实现生产机械化、自动化的道路。大量事实表明，不仅在社会主义建设事业上可以取得大跃进的速度，而且在技术的发展上，也可以取得大跃进的速度。
    我省开展技术革新和技术革命运动的无数事实表明：彻底地改变技术的落后面貌，实现党的八大二次会议所提出的技术革命的伟大历史任务，尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，乃是我国人民梦寐以求的迫切愿望。这种愿望，一经有了毛泽东思想的启发，人们的主观能动性得以充分的发挥，就可以创造出无穷的惊人奇迹。因此，我们始终注意了以毛泽东思想为指导思想，充分发挥人民群众的主观能动作用，结合生产发展需要，开展以“四化”为中心的全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动。现在，我把我们的主要具体做法介绍如下：
    具体作法和几点体会
    第一，破除对于机械化、自动化以及各种新技术的神秘感，实现技术的不断革命。
    事实证明，凡是认真地按照毛主席关于敢想敢干与科学分析相结合和不断革命论的指示精神办事的，就都获得了技术革命的胜利。这次运动的发展过程，也是打破对于机械化、自动化和新技术的神秘感的过程。我省在1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动中，虽然已经打破了人们对于大炼钢铁的迷信，但是人们却对于机械化、自动化，在几个月以前，还认为是十分神秘的。新企业中有人说：“我们的企业是世界第一流的新企业，比这再高程度的机械化、自动化，外国还没有，我们能搞得出吗？”旧企业和小企业中有人说：“我们企业又旧又小，比不上新企业，鸡窝里出不了凤凰，那里能搞得出机械化、自动化？”针对这种情况，我们就用毛主席关于破除迷信，解放思想的教导来教育广大群众，鼓励大家要敢想敢干，要勇于发明创造。于是这种神秘感很快地就被打破了，事情马上变了样子。在短短的几个月时间内，就出现了成千上万的机械化、自动化的革新与创造。哈尔滨市出现的第一批自动线中的丝锥自动线，在创制过程中，由于一部分人的思想上存有右倾保守思想和自卑感，几次企图“缓办”和“下马”，前后共花了八个月的时间才制成。右倾保守思想和神秘感被打破以后，该市技术革命运动的发展速度就越来越快，由去年10月份起，到今年3月12日，四个半月的时间内，共出现了七百一十条自动线，二千五百七十六台自动化单机。而从3月12日到3月底的十九天时间内，自动线八百五十六条，自动化单机五千零五十八台。
    过去不少人认为县办工业是没有条件大搞机械化、自动化的。但是，在认真贯彻执行了毛主席关于敢想敢干、破除迷信和不断革命的教导以后，情形也完全变了。目前我省有不少县办工业的机械化、半机械化程度已达90％以上。例如：肇东县，至3月20日为止，就已实现了三百九十项手工操作机械化，出现了三十四条自动生产线，一百二十个工厂实现了机械化、半机械化。
    工厂还是那些工厂，人还是那些人，物质条件也基本上还是那些，只因为人们以毛泽东思想为武器，破除了迷信，解放了思想，逐步掌握了科学的客观规律，事情就大大变了样子。
    第二，认真贯彻“两条腿走路”、洋土并举，自力更生的方针。
    像这样一个发展速度如此之快，规模空前之大的全面技术改造运动，如果全靠向国家要投资，要设备，那是一件根本不可设想的事。因此，我们在运动一开始就注意克服重洋轻土的思想，坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席所指示的两条腿走路、洋土并举、自力更生的方针。因为只有这样才能使全省各个角落、各行各业都能根据自己的具体情况，结合生产需要，自力更生地能洋就洋，不能洋就土，大家都动手，到处搞起来使运动形成全民性质。因此，在领导技术革新和技术革命运动上，一方面抓了遥控、遥测、遥讯等高级的自动化和高、大、精、尖、新产品的创造；同时也抓了简易的技术革新。譬如，把现有机床改为自动化，就同时有两种做法：一种是采用高级的电气原件操纵的，如磁带录音机式和光电操纵的程序控制机床等；另一种则是采用简单的凸轮和弹簧制动的，如机械联动自动化机床等。在运动中，发展尖端技术，也是采取两条腿走路的方法，既用洋法搞尖端，也用土法搞尖端。例如：哈尔滨机联机械厂，在极为简陋的条件下所创造的“三化四度”（“三化”指用途多能化、运转自动化、部件通用化；“四度”指机床速度、精度、钢度、合理刀具角度都是很好的）的新型积木式机床、哈尔滨创造的可以代替暖气系统的极为简单而又颇为合理的暖风炉，以及哈尔滨猪鬃厂创造的猪鬃加工机等就都是“土法搞尖端，鸡窝出凤凰”的出色事例。
    无数的事实表明：只有洋土并举，两条腿走路，才能有蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动，才能既有普及又有提高，才能有改进技术的大跃进速度，才能有整个国民经济发展的大跃进速度，这是一条真理。这条真理是毛主席给马列主义政治经济学增添的一件新武器。
    第三、坚持群众路线的工作方法，大搞“生产运动会”。
    正如大家所知道的，群众路线是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，也是我们党领导革命和建设事业的根本路线。依靠群众，大搞群众运动，是我们领导革命与建设事业不断前进的基本方法。在这次技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们在不断加强党的领导的同时，特别注意了依靠群众，充分调动群众的力量来搞技术革新与技术革命。在运动中，我省职工创造了一种为群众所喜闻乐见的叫作“生产运动会”的新的竞赛形式。这种竞赛过程是仿照群众都很熟悉的体育运动会的做法，根据生产发展需要安排竞赛项目；组织职工围绕竞赛项目进行技术大练兵，互相学习，准备比赛；进行技术表演赛，层层选拔（冠军、亚军、殿军）；总结竞赛中的好经验，成龙配套；采用推广队、大表演等各种方法推广好经验。这种竞赛分为单项的和全能的两种，既可以在企业内部进行，也可以在一个地区或一个企业进行。这种竞赛形式的优点很多：由于层层选拔，你追我赶，大大地调动了群众的生产积极性；由于以革新技术为中心，赛经济指标与赛技术相结合，有效地发挥了群众的智慧和才能，总结推广了先进经验；由于把发明创造与学习推广相结合，真正体现了社会主义竞赛互相帮助、共同提高的原则；同时由于“运动会”是分届举行，也合乎劳逸结合的要求。
    现在这种竞赛形式已经在我省广泛运用。齐齐哈尔市今年以来举行了全市规模的比赛刃具革新的“赛刀会”和比赛铸造技术的“赛模会”，很短的时间内就出现了一千一百九十六套新模具，大大提高铸造的生产能力。哈尔滨市在1月和3月连续举行了两届全市规模的生产运动会。哈尔滨市“元月开门红”的一次运动会中就出现了冠军、亚军能手六万六千三百人，其中一天完成两至十天以上工作量的有四万人，出现合理化建议二十二万件，自动化生产线八十七条、自动化单机三百二十台、手工操作机械化一千九百项。可见，“生产运动会”这种竞赛形式是我们充分发动群众，贯彻群众路线的十分良好的竞赛形式之一。
    第四、大兴共产主义协作之风
    我们在运动中经常注意以毛主席关于政治挂帅，大兴共产主义协作之风的指示精神来教育广大群众，并普遍推行企业内外“三结合”的经验，这就有力地推动了技术革命的迅速进展，事实也证明，凡是重大的创造，多半是共产主义大协作的产物。比如：我省第一条自动化生产线——丝锥自动化生产线是哈尔滨量具刃具厂与工具研究所合作的产物；不用钢筋、不用木材、不用砖瓦、不用水泥的新技术试验楼，是哈尔滨市建筑工程公司与土木研究所等单位合作的产物；新型“积木式”机床是哈尔滨机联机械厂与哈尔滨工业大学合作的产物。去年我省出现的“四合一”环形供电的经验，也是共产主义大协作的产物。
    这种共产主义大协作，已经把我省工业、农业、交通、文教、财贸等各个战线上的职工和群众，组织起来了。在技术革命进程中，一处碰到困难，处处都来支援。大学教授、大学生、科学研究人员到车间、工地，支援工人们的技术革新；工人不仅在工厂内大闹技术革命，而且组成了协作队，主动去支援农业、商店的技术革新。所有的技术革新项目，既是你的，也是我的，一事成功，大家光荣。由此可以看出，技术大革命，不仅在经济上可以创造出无穷的物质财富，而且可以横扫旧社会遗留下来的自私自利、保守落后的旧观念、旧习气，从而树立起高尚的共产主义道德风尚，大大改变人们的精神面貌。
    第五，适应技术发展的要求，不断地改进企业管理工作。
    毛主席经常教导我们生产关系必须与生产力的发展相适应，在领导工作中必须经常注意调整他们相互之间不断产生的新的矛盾，以促进生产力的不断迅速发展。技术革命运动的全面发展，大大提高了生产力，许多原有管理机构、管理制度、管理工具已逐渐与生产力发展的要求不相适应了。因此，我们必须：在计划管理方面，要求根据机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的高效率生产，编制计划，准备材料；在劳动工资管理方面，要求及时地改变劳动组织，有效地使用劳动力，合理地解决由于革新技术带来的工资奖励问题；在财务管理方面，要求及时地改进核算统计工作，使技术的革新能创造出最大的经济效果；在技术管理方面，要求修改那些不能适应“四化”要求的规章制度；在企业内部的体制方面，也要求管理的机构形式适合于“四化”的新情况。
    随着技术大革命的急剧进展，我省的企业管理工作也正在发生着新的变化。有些企业已经大大改变了原有的管理机构和劳动组织。比如：哈尔滨电表仪器厂的软轴生产车间，在全部实现自动化后，已经由车间变为工段，由工段又变为一条直属厂部的自动生产线。这条线是由两个人操纵的，他们既是管理者，又是生产者。还有许多企业的科室工作，也进行了改革。齐齐哈尔市的第一工程公司，在一个月的时间内，十三个科室通过总结经验制定了十三套适应新情况的规章制度和七十七项新的工作方法。
    正像宇宙火箭不能用手工的计算工具计算里程一样，旧有的管理工具已经不能适应机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的高效率生产的需要。例如：一条高效率的自动线每小时就可以生产几千以至几万件成品，如果仍然用人手去逐个地计算成品的数目，或者用人来汇报生产的各种情况，显然已经十分不能适应生产的需要了。因此，在我省现正展开了一个管理工具的大革命。牡丹江市今年1、2月创造
  出二百四十六种共七千五百多件速算工具和电气化、自动化管理工具。哈尔滨出现了二百五十四条管理核算流水线和七千四百多种核算工具。其中有高级电气仪表控制的自动化设备，也有简易的自动检斤、检尺、记录等仪器。过去需要一昼夜才能计算出来的经济指标，现在一小时内就可以知道了，工人形容说：“汇报不用口，传递不用走，卡片不用抽，盖章不用手”。这些管理工具的改革，不仅大大地提高了管理工作的效率，而且进一步适应了生产和技术的发展要求，并为工人参加管理创造了更为有利的条件。
    随着技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，工人参加管理的制度也有了新发展。工人不仅已经参加了生产管理、技术管理，而且也参加了科学研究；许多纺织工人成了新的纺织机械的设计者和制造者；许多操纵机械的工人成了新机械的创造者；有不少先进的技术革新者，已经在广大群众中享有很高的威望，有的被称为“智多星”，有的被称为“活钥匙”“活神仙”，有的被称为“万能灶”。工人阶级出身的红色专门家已经成批地涌现出来。完全可以预见，这一运动必将为我国社会主义建设事业锻炼出千千万万新的红色专门家。
    此外还有一些做法，譬如对新生事物必须加以大力培植和支持；制定技术革命的全面规划，根据规划，搞战役，分段突击以及在大闹技术革命的同时，大闹文化革命等。
    我省在这次技术革命运动中之所以能够获得较快进展，取得一定成绩，这是党的领导、群众路线、“三大法宝”的伟大胜利。而党的领导群众路线，“三大法宝”又是毛主席对马列主义创造性的重要发展的一个部分。因此，归根结底，这些胜利都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想在技术革命运动中的伟大胜利。
    我们在领导开展这一运动中，虽然取得一定成绩，但距离需要还相差很远，运动发展还不够平衡，经验总结与传播还不那样及时和系统，工作中也还存在一些缺点和问题，为了把今后技术革命运动和各项工作作得更好，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，树雄心，立大志，加强领导，全面规划，从而把这一全民性的技术革命运动由高潮引向更高潮，由胜利引向更大的胜利。
    祝大会胜利成功！
