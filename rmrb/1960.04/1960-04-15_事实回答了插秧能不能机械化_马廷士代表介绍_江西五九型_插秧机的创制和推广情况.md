Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

	I fully endorse the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

	After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the great call to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and strive to basically complete the mechanization of agriculture in our country in about ten years, the whole party and the people of our province immediately responded enthusiastically and quickly launched a wave of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automatization. The broad masses of workers and peasants fully developed the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, broke superstitions, established great ambitions, carried out innovation, made creations, and new inventions and new tools emerged continuously. The successful creation of the "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter is an outstanding product of the millions of new creations, new inventions, and new tools of the people of our province. After appraisal and repeated testing, the "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter has reached a very high technical level. First, the efficiency of transplanting is high. One person operating a rice transplanter can transplant six to seven mu of rice seedlings per day, increasing efficiency by five to six times compared to manual transplanting. Second, the quality of transplanting is good, with uniform seedling separation, consistent depth, and neat rows, which can ensure reasonable close planting, which is conducive to the growth and development of rice, and has basically eliminated phenomena such as missed seedlings, hooked seedlings, floating seedlings, and damaged seedlings. The commune members describe it as: "Transplanting with a rice transplanter, every seedling is the same size, every pocket is the same depth, and every row is as neat as a scholar's handwriting." Third, the operation is light and convenient, greatly reducing labor intensity, and can be used by women and semi-able-bodied laborers. Commune members sing: "The rice transplanter shows its power; transplants quickly and accurately, the back doesn't ache, the legs don't hurt, promotes increased production, and makes outstanding contributions." Fourth, the machine body is sturdy, the parts are firm, there are few failures, and it can operate persistently after going into the water. Fifth, it has good adaptability and is suitable for operating on early rice, late rice, and various seedlings such as water, drought, old, tender, long, and short. Due to the many advantages of the rice transplanter, it is welcomed by the broad masses of the people. Therefore, our province plans to comprehensively promote its use this year, and can manufacture 130,000 units during the spring transplanting period. If each unit transplants an average of six mu per day, and the transplanting time is calculated as twenty days, each unit can transplant 120 mu, and 130,000 rice transplanters can complete 15.6 million mu of transplanting tasks, accounting for 62% of the 25 million mu of early rice in our province; by the time of late rice transplanting, the province will have increased to 160,000 rice transplanters, basically realizing semi-mechanization of rice transplanting.

	The successful creation and promotion of the "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter is a major revolution in rice cultivation technology in our province and is of great significance for promoting greater agricultural production and achieving continuous leaps forward. Raising seedlings in nurseries and transplanting in water is a fine tradition of intensive cultivation in rice production in our country, but rice transplanting work has always been done manually, and even the simplest tools were lacking. The labor intensity of this work is very high, with people bending over all day long, which is very tiring. After the widespread promotion and use of rice transplanters, this situation will be completely changed, and people can stand up to transplant, greatly reducing fatigue. At the same time, it will save a large amount of labor. According to surveys, the amount of manual transplanting work in our province generally accounts for about 10% of the total workload of rice production, requiring a lot of labor. After the province promotes the use of 160,000 rice transplanters this year, it can save more than 25 million labor days. Because rice transplanters have high transplanting efficiency, good quality, and save a lot of labor, they can engage in intensive cultivation and better promote rice production. Based on the situation of an increase of about 6% to 10% in mechanical transplanting last year, calculated at the lowest increase of 5% per mu, this item alone can increase production by 700 to 800 million jin of grain this year.

	The "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter has undergone countless struggles from the beginning of trial production to finalization and promotion. It is necessary to fight against the difficulties caused by the lack of ready-made experience, and also to fight against the obstacles of right-leaning conservative thinking. Party organizations at all levels resolutely supported the creative activities of the rice transplanter creators and nurtured this new thing from all aspects. The achievements and power of the people's communes and the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country have greatly encouraged the people of our province who created the rice transplanter.

	*Multiple tests, repeated improvements, from the masses, to the masses*

	The success of the rice transplanter once again proves that in all work or production, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and carry out mass movements on a large scale. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, various places in our province fully mobilized the masses to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and boldly create rice transplanters. By the end of the year, more than 20 types of rice transplanters had been designed and manufactured in various places in the province. At the beginning of 1959, with the large-scale development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, after we repeatedly tested and initially finalized the "Red Flag No. 1" and "Red Flag No. 2" rice transplanters, we immediately manufactured more than 100 sample units and sent them to various places in the province for trial use and research improvement, and successively held more than ten provincial technical experience exchange meetings and on-site meetings, and held multiple training classes, and promptly disseminated to various places the manufacturing and use of rice transplanter technology, mobilizing the broad masses to further try out and improve the rice transplanters. Then, a heatwave of test using and improving rice transplanters quickly formed within the province, and tens of thousands of workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, cadres and technicians were swept into the heatwave, and they overcame various difficulties and made many major improvements to the rice transplanters. Workers at the Jinxian County Machinery Factory added a seedling support plate to the bottom of the seedling, which changed the past phenomenon of uneven seedling separation and greatly improved the uniformity of transplanting. Handicraftsmen in Jinxi County improved the square slider of the seedling boat into a tongue-shaped slider, eliminating the "head planting" phenomenon that occurred after transplanting and enhancing the stability during operation. Technicians from the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences found a method of equidistant movement of the seedling box, which solved the difficulty that the seedling box could not move equidistantly in the past. After making many major improvements, we adopted the method of testing, improving, and promoting at the same time, and sent more than ten work groups to various places to summarize the results and experience of the improvement, and then, based on the improvement situation in various places, we manufactured another batch of samples and sent them to various places, mobilizing the broad masses to further test and improve the rice transplanters. In this way, from the masses, to the masses, after repeated testing and improvement, from low to high, continuously improving, the structure and performance became increasingly perfect, and finally the current "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter was successfully created. From here, we have once again deeply realized that carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, like other tasks, as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, boldly mobilize the masses, and carry out mass movements on a large scale, we can quickly achieve victory.

	The successful creation of the rice transplanter has broken the superstitious idea that "rice transplanting cannot be mechanized" in the past, and has opened up a smooth path for the comprehensive realization of mechanized paddy field operations. At the beginning of the trial production, some people once believed that transplanting rice seedlings with machines was inconceivable, and they asserted that "If you can transplant rice seedlings with a wooden machine, you can eat stones as food." Others said that mechanical transplanting is a cutting-edge technology that developed capitalist industrial countries have not solved after long-term research, and we have backward technology and cannot solve it even more. When some technical problems in the rice transplanter were not yet resolved during the trial production stage, they were even more gloating, saying "The experiment has reached its peak!" "Continuing to do it will only cause greater waste." After the rice transplanter was initially successfully trial-produced, they doubted whether it could increase production, and said that it did not conform to mechanical principles, and would affect the fine tradition of rice technology in our country, and so on. When the rice transplanter was successfully tested, people with conservative thinking, in order to cover up the right-leaning in their thinking, spread the fallacy that "rice transplanters can only be used in small areas and cannot be promoted in large areas." They emphasized that "the fields are small and the roads are narrow, making it difficult to operate, and the terrain is rugged, making it difficult to use," etc. But the broad masses of workers and peasants were not intimidated by the difficulties. They worked hard and tirelessly, learned from each other, boldly created, and tried every means to overcome the difficulties. Peasants in Jinxian County made a triangular operating hand frame based on the experience of using operating handles on agricultural tools, making the operation of the rice transplanter more stable and lighter. The workers in the county manufactured a depth adjuster for the rice transplanter based on the principle of the regulator used in industrial machines, and the transplanting can be deep or shallow, and can be used freely. Now countless facts have proven that not only can transplanting be mechanized, but it can also increase production; rice transplanters are not only tools for improving labor efficiency and reducing labor intensity, but also tools for increasing production.

	*The creation of the rice transplanter came from ordinary workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen*

	The success of the rice transplanter once again proves the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. It is said that some capitalist countries have been researching rice transplanters for half a century, but they have not yet come up with anything famous. And the people of our province successfully created rice transplanters in a short period of time. This is because: First, we have the leadership of the Party, we have a superior socialist system, and the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the whole province adhere to putting politics in command, carry forward the communist spirit, boldly create, help each other, and learn from each other, so they quickly created success. In capitalist countries, everything is for profit, for personal wealth, secrets are kept from each other, and they fight each other, so they cannot create rice transplanters like we do in a short period of time. Second, precisely because our country is a socialist country, we can adopt the method of the mass line, fully mobilize the masses to carry out trial production and improvement, concentrate collective wisdom, and therefore, the difficult problems in the creation were quickly solved one by one, and the rice transplanter was successfully created smoothly.

	The successful creation of the "Jiangxi 59 Model" rice transplanter best embodies the infinite wisdom of the broad working masses. It was not created by people with "profound knowledge" and "mechanical knowledge," but by some of the most ordinary workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen. These ordinary working people, who were called "bumpkins" by bourgeois experts, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, have a high degree of socialist and communist consciousness, have soaring revolutionary vigor, dare to break superstitions, liberate their minds, dare to think and dare to do, are not afraid of losing face, are not afraid of failure, and do it again after failure, humbly learn, work hard, and persevere to the end, so they quickly succeeded. This fact also shows that all scientific and technical personnel must put down their airs, resolutely devote themselves to the fiery mass movement, and combine book theoretical knowledge with the practical experience of workers and peasants in order to give full play to their role and make truly beneficial contributions.

	Although our province has entered the stage of large-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters, because they have not been created and used for long, it is inevitable that some problems will be encountered in the promotion and use. Therefore, in the future, we need to continue to strengthen leadership, adhere to carrying out mass movements on a large scale, summarize experience in a timely manner, continuously research and improve, and actively prepare to improve from human and animal power operation to mechanical power operation, so that transplanting operations can transition from the current semi-mechanization to mechanization more quickly. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the victorious red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the people of our province will surely be able to quickly realize mechanized farmland operations.

    事实回答了插秧能不能机械化
    马廷士代表介绍“江西五九型”插秧机的创制和推广情况主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    党中央和毛主席提出加速农业技术改造，争取在十年左右时间内基本上完成我国农业机械化的伟大号召之后，我省全党全民立即热烈响应，迅速掀起了一个以机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化为中心的农业技术革新与技术革命浪潮。广大工农群众充分发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，破迷信、立大志、搞革新、搞创造，新发明，新工具不断涌现。“江西五九型”插秧机的创造成功，正是我省人民的千百万项新创造、新发明、新工具中的杰出产品。经过鉴定与反复试验，“江西五九型”插秧机已达到很高的技术水平。第一、插秧工效高，一人操纵一部插秧机，每天可以插秧六亩至七亩，比人工手插提高工效五倍至六倍。第二、插秧质量好，分秧均匀，深浅一致，横直整齐，能保证合理密植，有利水稻生长发育，并已基本消灭了漏秧、勾秧、漂秧、伤秧等现象。社员们形容说：“用插秧机插秧，棵棵一样大小，兜兜一样深浅，行行一样整齐，赛过秀才写字。”第三、操作轻便，大大减轻了劳动强度，妇女、半劳动力都可以使用。社员歌唱道：“插秧机，显威风；插得快，插得正，腰不酸，腿不痛，促增产，立奇功。”第四、机身坚固，部件牢稳，故障很少，下水后可以持久地作业。第五、适应性很好，对早稻、晚稻和水、旱、老、嫩、长、短等各种秧苗，都适应操作。由于插秧机具有上述许多优点，受到广大人民群众的欢迎。因而我省今年计划全面推广使用，在春季插秧期间可以制造十三万部，如果以每台每日平均插秧六亩，以二十天插秧时间计算，每台可插一百二十亩，十三万台插秧机可完成一千五百六十万亩插秧任务，占我省早稻二千五百万亩的62％；到晚稻插秧时全省将增加到有十六万部插秧机，基本实现水稻插秧半机械化。
    “江西五九型”水稻插秧机的创制成功与推广使用，是我省水稻栽培技术上的一个大革命，对促进农业更大增产，实现持续跃进具有重大的意义。育秧水插，是我国水稻生产精耕细作的优良传统，但水稻插秧工作一直是人工手插，连最简单的工具都没有。这种工作的劳动强度很大，终日弯腰曲背，非常劳累。插秧机普遍推广使用后，便将完全改变了这种情况，人们可以站立插秧，大大减少劳累。同时将节省大批劳力。据调查，我省手工插秧工作量一般占水稻生产全部工作量的10％左右，需要花许多劳力。今年全省推广使用十六万部插秧机后，可节省两千五百多万个劳动日。由于插秧机插秧工效高，质量好，节约大量的劳动力，从事精耕细作，更好的促使水稻增产。根据去年机插大约增产6％到10％的情况，以最低幅度每亩增产5％计算，今年全省仅此一项即可增产七、八亿斤粮食。
      “江西五九型”插秧机从开始试制到定型推广，中间经过了无数次的斗争。既要和由于缺乏现成经验所产生的困难作斗争，又要和右倾保守思想的障碍作斗争。党的各级组织坚决支持插秧机创制者的创制活动，从各方面培育这个新生事物。人民公社的成就与威力，我国社会主义建设的高速度发展，都给我省创制插秧机的人们以巨大鼓舞。
    多次试验，反复改进，从群众中来，到群众中去
    插秧机的成功，再次证明了在一切工作或生产中都必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。1958年大跃进中，我省各地充分发动群众破除迷信，解放思想，大胆创造插秧机。至年底时，全省各地设计与制造了二十余种型号的插秧机。1959年一开始，随着技术革新与技术革命运动的大规模开展，我们通过反复试验初步定型了“红旗一号”与“红旗二号”插秧机后，立即制造了一百多部样品，发到全省各地进行试用与研究改进，并接连召开了十多次全省性的技术经验交流会，现场会，举办了多次训练班，及时向各地传布了制造与使用插秧机技术的情况，发动广大群众来进一步试用改进插秧机。接着，全省内迅速形成了一个试用改进插秧机的热潮，被卷入热潮的有成千上万工人、农民、手工业者、干部与技术人员，他们战胜种种困难，对插秧机做了许多重大改进。进贤县机械厂工人在秧的下边加装托秧板，改变了过去分秧不匀的现象，使插秧均匀度大大提高。金溪县手工业者把秧船方形滑板改进成为舌形滑板，消灭了插秧后发生的“栽头”现象，增强了作业时的稳定性。省农科所技术人员找到了秧箱等距移动的办法，解决了过去秧箱不能等距移动的困难，在做了许多重大改进后，我们采取边试验、边改进、边推广的办法，派出了十多个工作组到各地总结改进的成果与经验，然后根据各地改进的情况，又制造了一批样品发到各地，发动广大群众更进一步地试用改进插秧机。如此，从群众中来，到群众中去，经过多次反复试验改进，由低到高、不断提高，机构、性能日趋完善，最后终于创制成功现在的“江西五九型”水稻插秧机。从这里，我们又深深体会到，开展技术革新与技术革命，和其它各项工作一样，只要坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，就能迅速取得胜利。
    插秧机的创制成功，破除了过去有人认为“插秧不能机械化”的迷信思想，为全面实现水田机械化作业开辟了顺畅的道路。开始试制时，有一部分人曾经认为用机器插秧是不可思议的，他们断定说：“能用木机子插秧，就能用石头当饭吃。”还有的人说什么机械插秧是资本主义工业发达国家经过长期研究没有解决的尖端技术，我们技术落后，更不能解决。当插秧机在试制阶段有些技术问题尚未解决时，他们更是幸灾乐祸，说“试验到了顶啦！”“再搞下去只会造成更大浪费。”当插秧机初步试制成功后，他们又怀疑能否增产，并说什么不合乎机械原理啦，影响我国水稻技术的优良传统啦等等。插秧机试验成功的时候，具有保守思想的人们，为了掩饰自己思想上的右倾，他们又散布“插秧机只能小面积使用，不能在大面积上推广”的谬论。他们强调说：“田小路窄，难以运行，地形崎岖，难以使用”等。但是广大工人农民并没有被困难所吓倒，他们坚韧不拔地刻苦钻研，互相学习，大胆创造，千方百计战胜了困难。进贤县农民根据在农具上使用操作手把的经验制成三角形操作手架，使操作插秧机更稳定更轻巧。该县的工人根据工业机器使用的调节器的原理，为插秧机制造了深浅调节器，插秧可深可浅，运用自如。现在无数事实业已证明：插秧不仅可以机械化，而且可以增产；插秧机不仅是提高劳动效率、减轻劳动强度的工具，而且是增产的工具。	插秧机的创制，出自普通的工人、农民和手工业者
    插秧机的成功，再次证明了我国社会主义制度优越无比。据说有的资本主义国家对水稻插秧机已研究了半个世纪，至今尚未搞出名堂来。而我省人民在短期内就成功地创制了水稻插秧机。这是因为：第一，我们有党的领导，有优越的社会主义制度，全省工人农民与知识分子坚持政治挂帅，发扬共产主义风格，大胆创造，互相帮助，彼此学习，因而迅速创造成功。在资本主义国家里，一切为了利润，为了个人发财，彼此保密，互相倾轧，所以他们就不可能像我们这样在短期内创制出插秧机来。第二，正因为我国是社会主义国家，我们能采取群众路线的方法，充分发动群众进行试制改进，集中了集体智慧，因而，创制中的困难问题，一个个地得到迅速解决，顺利地创制成功了插秧机。
    “江西五九型”插秧机创制成功，最好地体现了广大劳动群众的无穷智慧。它并不是具有什么“高深学问”和“机械知识”的人创造出来的，创造这一机具都是一些最普通的工人、农民和手工业者。他们这些被资产阶级专家称为“土包子”的普通劳动人民，在党的领导与鼓舞下，有高度的社会主义与共产主义觉悟，有冲天的革命干劲，敢于破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，不怕丢面子，不怕失败，失败了再干，虚心学习，刻苦钻研，坚持到底，因此，很快就搞成功了。这一事实也就说明，所有科学技术人员必须放下架子，坚决投身于火热的群众运动中，和工人农民一道，把书本理论知识与工人农民的实践经验结合起来，才能充分发挥作用，作出真正有益的贡献。
    我省虽然已进入大面积推广使用插秧机阶段，但是由于创制与使用不久，难免在推广使用中将遇到一些问题，因此，今后需要继续加强领导，坚持大搞群众运动，及时总结经验，不断的研究改进，积极准备由人力、畜力操作提高到机械动力操作，使插秧作业较快地从现在半机械化过渡到机械化。我们坚信，在党中央与毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社胜利红旗的光辉照耀下，我省人民一定能够迅速实现农田机械化作业。
