Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: To greet the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries are publishing books about him.

    A more complete biography of Lenin is about to be published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House. The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU organized a writing group led by Pospelov to compile this biography. The book is divided into a preface, thirteen chapters, and an epilogue.

    While recounting Lenin's life, this biography also elaborates on his important guiding ideology. Compared with previous versions, the new version makes fuller use of a large number of memoirs. Many vivid examples of this revolutionary teacher, written by Lenin's comrades-in-arms and modern famous figures, have been included in the biography.

    A photo album containing one hundred and four photos of Lenin has been published in Moscow. Most of them are photos reflecting Lenin's activities in leading the Party and the government in various aspects.

    The Polish "Iskry" Publishing House has published the book "Lenin Lives Among Us." The book includes Gorky's and Zetkin's recollections of Lenin, as well as poems about Lenin written by Mayakovsky, Brecht, Broniewski, Sewald, and other writers.

    The Czechoslovak State Political Literature Publishing House has issued a collection of recollections about Lenin, "They Spoke with Lenin." This collection consists of memoirs written by famous activists of the Czechoslovak workers' movement, including Václavek, Olbracht, Šmeral, Zápotocký, and others. Those who personally met with the great leader of the working people and talked with him emphasized Lenin's great influence on the establishment and development of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    The "Lenin on Mongolia" collection, compiled by the Institute of Party History of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, has also been published. The collection includes Lenin's works elaborating on Mongolian issues, as well as memoirs written by people who met Lenin when the Mongolian government delegation headed by Sukhe-Bator visited Moscow in 1921.

    据新华社17日讯　苏联和其他各兄弟国家纷纷出版书籍迎接伟大的革命导师列宁诞辰九十周年。
    一本更为完整的列宁传记即将由苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版。苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院为了编写这本传记，组织了由波斯别洛夫领导的写作组。这本书分序言、十三个章节和结束语。
    这本传记在记述列宁生平的同时，还阐述了他的重要的领导思想。与过去的版本比较，新版本更充分地利用了大量的回忆录，列宁的战友和现代著名人物所写的描述这一位革命导师的许多活生生的事例都被收入了传记。
    在莫斯科已经出版了一本收入了一百零四张列宁的照片的照相集。其中大部分是反应列宁在领导党和政府的各方面的活动的照片。
    波兰“火花”出版社出版了“列宁生活在我们中间”一书。书中包括高尔基、蔡特金对列宁的回忆以及马雅可夫斯基、布雷希特、布罗涅夫斯基、谢瓦尔德和其它作家写的关于列宁的诗。
    捷克斯洛伐克国家政治书籍出版社发行了关于列宁的回忆集“他们同列宁谈过话”。这本集子是捷克斯洛伐克工人运动著名活动家们写的，其中包括瓦契克、奥尔布拉赫特、什麦拉尔、萨波托斯基等人的回忆录。亲身会见过劳动人民伟大的领袖和同他谈过话的人都强调指出列宁对捷克斯洛伐克共产党的建立和发展的巨大影响。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会党史研究所编的“列宁论蒙古”文集也已出版。集子里收入了列宁阐述有关蒙古问题的作品，以及1921年以苏赫巴托尔为首的蒙古政府代表团访问莫斯科时会见过列宁的人写的回忆录。
