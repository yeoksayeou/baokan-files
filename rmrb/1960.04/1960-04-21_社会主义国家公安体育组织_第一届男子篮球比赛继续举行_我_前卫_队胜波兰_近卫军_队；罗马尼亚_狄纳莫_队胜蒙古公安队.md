Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The Socialist Countries' Public Security Sports Organization held its first Men's Basketball Tournament tonight.

In the two games held tonight, the Chinese "Qianwei" team defeated the Polish "Guards" team with a score of 66 to 57; the Romanian "Dinamo" team defeated the Mongolian People's Republic Public Security team with a score of 72 to 29.

The game between the Chinese "Qianwei" team and the Polish "Guards" team was extremely intense. The two sides tied five times throughout the game. The "Qianwei" team's shooting was inaccurate in the first half, and they were four points behind their opponents at the end of the half, with a score of 25 to 29. It was not until they adopted a tight, man-to-man defensive strategy in the second half that they began to turn the tide.

At the beginning, Zhang Jingfu and Wang Jiazhen of the "Qianwei" team respectively guarded the two tall players of the visiting team - the scoring experts Wysocki (No. 6) and Stawinoga (No. 7), making it difficult for them to score under the basket. At the same time, they passed the ball more to Cai Jijie, who was active under the basket, and he scored continuously. After the two sides tied at five, the scoring began to lead. However, the experienced "Guards" team then changed their tactics, on the one hand, strictly controlling the basket, preventing Cai Jijie and others from shooting calmly; on the other hand, captain Wojcik (No. 12) and the shorter Wawro (No. 3) and others shot from the outside, quickly tying the score at 19. At this time, the "Qianwei" team members were a little nervous, and repeatedly made passing and shooting errors, and the score began to fall behind.

Five minutes into the second half, the "Qianwei" team began to adopt a full-court tight, man-to-man defensive strategy, fighting for every ball, and launching fast breaks and shooting from the outside whenever they had the opportunity, and the situation changed quickly. After two or three minutes, the fourth and fifth ties appeared on the court - 40-40, 41-41. After this, the "Qianwei" team played smoothly, and the score increased more and more. Cai Jijie was very active, scoring a total of 25 points, becoming the player with the most individual points in all teams tonight. The "Guards" team's highest scorer was Stawinoga, who is one meter ninety-five tall, and he scored a total of fifteen points, thirteen of which were free throws.

The Romanian "Dinamo" team had an advantage in height and technique tonight. They led by thirty-four points in the first half with a score of 41 to 7. However, the Mongolian Public Security team launched a fierce counterattack in the second half. Captain Choin (No. 11), who is one meter eighty-five tall, was very active. He was not only good at cutting into the basket for layups, but also very accurate in mid-range shooting, making it difficult for opponents to defend him. He scored thirteen points alone in the second half. Therefore, they actually lost to their opponents by only nine points in the second half with a score of twenty-two to thirty-one.

The tournament will continue on the evening of the 21st, with the Soviet "Dinamo" team playing against the Mongolian People's Republic Public Security team; the Romanian "Dinamo" team playing against the Chinese "Qianwei" team.

    社会主义国家公安体育组织
    第一届男子篮球比赛继续举行
    我“前卫”队胜波兰“近卫军”队；罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队胜蒙古公安队
    新华社20日讯　社会主义国家公安体育组织第一届男子篮球比赛大会，今晚继续举行。
    在今晚举行的两场比赛中，中国“前卫”队以六十六比五十七赢了波兰“近卫军”队；罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队以七十二比二十九赢了蒙古人民共和国公安队。
    中国“前卫”队对波兰“近卫军”队的比赛，异常激烈。全场双方共五次打成平局。“前卫”队上半场投篮不准，比赛结束时曾以二十五比二十九落后对方四分。直到下半场他们采取紧逼人盯人的战术后，才开始扭转了战局。
    “前卫”队开头由张景富、王家桢分别看住客队两个长人——得分能手维索茨基（六号）和斯塔维诺加（七号），使他们很少获得在篮下得分的机会。同时多传球给在篮下活动的蔡集杰，由他连连投篮得分。从双方打成五平以后，得分就开始领先。但随后有经验的“近卫军”队改变了战术，一方面严密控制篮下，不让蔡集杰等人从容投篮；另一方面由队长沃伊齐克（十二号）和身材较矮的瓦夫罗（三号）等人在外围投篮，很快就追成了十九平。这时“前卫”队队员有些紧张，屡屡传球、投篮失误，比分开始落后。
    下半场比赛进行了五分钟以后，“前卫”队开始采取全场紧逼人盯人的战术，每球必争，一有机会就展开快攻和在外围投篮，局势很快发生了变化。过了两三分钟，场上就出现了第四次和第五次平局——四十平、四十一平。这以后，“前卫”队打来顺手，得分越来越多。蔡集杰十分活跃，全场共得了二十五分，成为今晚各队个人得分最多的队员。“近卫军”队得分最多的是身高一米九十五的斯塔维诺加，他共得了十五分，其中有十三分是罚中的。
    罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队今晚在身材高度和技术上都占了优势。上半场就以四十一比七领先了三十四分。但下半场蒙古公安队反攻很猛，身高一米八十五的队长乔因（十一号）十分活跃，他不仅善于切入上篮，而且中距离投篮也很准，使对手很难防守，下半场一个人就得了十三分。因而他们在下半场实际上只以二十二比三十一输给对方九分。
    这次比赛大会21日晚将继续举行，由苏联“狄纳莫”队对蒙古人民共和国公安队；罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队对中国“前卫”队。
