Chairman, fellow committee members:

At this National People's Congress and CPPCC sessions, we listened to the three reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and were greatly encouraged. Like all the delegates and committee members, I must diligently study these three reports. We will also listen to Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report and the important speeches of national leaders in the general assembly discussions, which I will also study diligently. Now, I would like to present some opinions on the topic of the united education and remolding work of social figures, and I invite all comrades to offer your corrections.

Our country is in an unprecedented great era: under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups across the country are united, holding high the three red flags of the general line for socialist construction, the continuous great leap forward in the national economic plan, and the people's communes, which are larger in size and have a higher degree of public ownership. Having victoriously completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we are now taking technological innovation and technological revolution as the center, promoting mass revolutionary movements on all construction fronts, wave after wave, higher and higher. The "poor and blank" face of our country has undergone tremendous changes. This change has presented us with a greater task, which is how to further implement Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people and mobilizing all positive factors for socialist construction. Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, in his work report, proposed that in the future, "we should actively promote the participation of social figures and the family members of democratic personages from all circles in street production and various tasks, and help them carry out political study." Under the current new situation, this measure is very correct and necessary.

Great Achievements Have Been Made in the Unity, Education, and Remolding Work of Social Figures in Recent Years

In recent years, the CPPCC National Committee and local CPPCC organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party, have directly or guided and assisted the democratic parties in carrying out the work of uniting, educating, and remolding social figures, have done a lot of work, and have achieved great success. For example, after the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal CPPCC Committee held in December last year decided to vigorously develop the work of contacting social figures, it adopted active measures to assist the democratic parties to immediately carry out their work. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) alone, under the slogan of "fully restoring and actively developing," has now contacted more than 2,000 people and carried out various forms of educational work accordingly, achieving great success. The on-site conference on county CPPCC work held in Shandong Province in the winter of 1958 summarized the experience of Shou Zhang and Yuncheng counties in working with social figures. After that, the provincial, municipal, and local county CPPCCs extensively launched education and remolding work for social figures in cities and scattered in rural areas. The Fujian Provincial CPPCC guided the local RCCK organization to contact more than 1,200 people, closely grasping the three main links of "learning, seeing, and doing," and creating a lot of work experience. The Kaifeng Municipal CPPCC in Henan Province established farms and factories, attracting many social figures and their families to participate in production, creating a lot of wealth for the country. There are many other examples in various places, which will not be listed one by one. These social figures basically belonged to the exploiting classes and old intellectuals of the old society, and generally had two sides of accepting socialist remolding and taking the capitalist road. After being contacted and undergoing education and remolding work, they have all made progress to varying degrees. Generally speaking, on the basis of their original political ideas, socialist factors are gradually expanding, and capitalist factors are relatively shrinking. In recent years, the CPPCC organizations in various places have actively implemented the policy of combining service and remolding in social contact work, and a large number of social figures have participated in street services and labor production, among which many advanced workers and advanced collectives have emerged. For example, in Fuzhou, among the 280 social figures who regularly participated in study, 133 participated in various street activities, accounting for 47.5% of the number of participants, of which 48 people won 57 awards in their work last year, accounting for 39.1% of the number of participants. The satellite fields planted by social figures in Weinan, Shaanxi, won the red flag. Social figures in Quanzhou have been repeatedly rated as advanced collectives and unit pacesetters in service and labor production. Thirty-eight social figures have won eighty-one awards. There are many such examples in other places, and some have even made contributions in technological innovation, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. Practice has proved that these social figures can generally accept socialist remolding, and can be remolded well. As long as we can do more work in this regard, we can turn their negativity into positivity and contribute to the cause of socialism.

The Rapidly Changing Face of the Motherland is a Favorable Situation for Promoting Self-Remolding of Social Figures

Now, the objective situation and subjective conditions for working with social figures are very favorable. First of all, there is the specific leadership of the Party committees at all levels of the CCP in the work, which is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well. In the international situation, the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, and the forces of peace and democracy are consolidating and expanding day by day. Domestically, the comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction, the consolidation and development of the people's communes, the unprecedented improvement of the communist consciousness of the people, and the rapidly changing face of the motherland are all favorable situations for promoting and influencing the self-remolding of social figures. At the same time, due to the fundamental changes in the social system, these social figures have lost the economic foundation of their original classes and are completely in the vast ocean of the working people. The rural outlook has changed after communization, and mass revolutionary movements to organize life and organize production are being carried out in cities across the country. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "Now, people's communes are being established on a large scale in cities across the country, street industries are being developed on a large scale, suburban agriculture is being developed on a large scale, public welfare undertakings are being developed on a large scale, and public canteens are being developed on a large scale, and the economic life of residents is being widely organized, further organizing the urban people and liberating tens of thousands of urban housewives from domestic labor to participate in social labor. All this is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life." For the vast number of social figures, this new situation is conducive to their transformation, and also affects their conscious demand for transformation. In fact, due to their certain progress in recent years, they generally have a conscious desire for transformation and service requirements. In addition, we have already laid a foundation for this work in the past and have gained some experience, then we have the necessity and the conditions to further do this work.

The transformation of these people's political stand and world outlook is a long-term, arduous, and repetitive task, but as long as we can work with them in the spirit of "going all out, aiming high," we can promote them to serve well and transform themselves as soon as possible in the spirit of "going all out, aiming high."

Study Chairman Mao's Writings, Throw Ourselves into Mass Movements, and Embark on the Broad Road of Socialism

Contacting social figures must firmly grasp the central link of ideological education. Only by constantly carrying out education work for them can we improve their political awareness, promote political transformation, and thus satisfy their conscious desire for transformation. Ideological education is an arduous and meticulous task, and it must be carried out according to the different situations in various places, according to their specific characteristics, adapting to local conditions and adapting to each individual. The methods and means should be diversified, gentle and patient, and guided by the situation. At any time and anywhere, we must put politics in command, with criticism and encouragement. We must neither be too hasty nor let things drift; we must both recognize their essential side and value their progress, even if it is only a little bit; we must both take care of their characteristics and promote them to live among the working people and accept new things. In practical work, we must closely combine study and transformation with service practice. Learning is for doing, and learning from doing, the two promote each other. Learning and doing should be combined with the central work and mass movements at any time. What is the central work, what to learn, what to do. When the mass movement rises, throw yourself into it and be educated and tempered in the mass movement. Facts have proved that this is an effective way to educate and transform social figures.

To carry out ideological education for social figures, we must help them study Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong thought is a model of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and is a major development of Marxism-Leninism. All the great victories that our country has achieved from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution and socialist construction are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. At present, the three magic weapons of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, which are the entire socialist construction period, are the products of Mao Zedong Thought. Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong all emphasized in their reports that conscientiously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future. Therefore, to help social figures carry out political transformation, we must strengthen the education of Mao Zedong Thought for them.

While uniting, educating, and transforming social figures, it is very necessary to do some corresponding work for the family members of some people where conditions permit. Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report: "Organizing the people's economic life and further developing collective welfare undertakings and service undertakings, so that domestic labor is socialized, is one of the urgent requirements of socialist construction. By organizing the people's life better, people can be encouraged to work harder and concentrate on productive labor, and more women can be liberated from domestic labor to participate in construction." Based on this requirement, if we can promote the family members of these social figures to participate in service and productive labor, and help them study and progress, this will not only be conducive to the development of production and conducive to collective life, but also can be transformed together with social figures, playing a good role in mutual influence.

In short, the current excellent situation has presented us with new topics and also provides us with favorable conditions for doing our work well. We have full confidence that, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, through our efforts, we will be able to do this work well, and we will be able to do this work well. Help the vast number of social figures to embark on the broad road of socialism happily with us, and contribute to the cause of socialism.

Finally, let me cheer for the great achievements in further developing the work for social figures; cheer for the great victory of the three red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune; and cheer for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

### 趁大好形势加强自我改造  邵力子常务委员的发言

    趁大好形势加强自我改造
    邵力子常务委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我们在这次人大、政协两大会上，听了李富春、李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的三个报告，得到很大的鼓舞。我同各位代表、委员一样，要好好学习这三个报告。我们还要听谭震林副总理的报告，和国家领导同志在大会讨论中的重要发言，我也要好好地学习。现在我就对社会人士的团结教育改造工作这一课题，陈述一点意见，请各位同志指正。
    我们的国家正处在一个空前的伟大时代：全国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，团结一致，高高举起社会主义建设总路线，国民经济计划持续大跃进，和一大二公的人民公社的三面红旗，胜利地提前完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标之后，正在以技术革新和技术革命为中心，在各个建设阵线上推动群众性的革命运动，一浪接一浪，一浪高一浪。我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌，已经发生了巨大变化。这一变化给我们提出了更大的任务，就是如何进一步贯彻毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动一切积极因素进行社会主义建设的指示。陈叔通副主席在工作报告中提出今后“要积极推动社会人士以及各界民主人士的家属参加街道生产和各种工作，并帮助他们进行政治学习。”在当前的新形势下，这一措施是非常正确而必要的。
    几年来，对社会人士的团结教育改造工作取得了很大成绩
    几年来，政协全国委员会和政协各级地方组织，在中国共产党的各级党委领导下，直接或者是指导帮助各民主党派进行社会人士的团结教育改造工作，做了很多事情，并且取得了很大成绩。例如上海市政协去年12月召开的二届二次委员会决定大力开展对社会人士的联系工作以后，采取积极措施，协助各民主党派，立即开展工作。仅民革一个单位，在“全面恢复积极开展”的口号下，现在已经联系了两千多人，并相应地进行了各式各样的教育工作，取得很大成绩。山东省在1958年冬举行的县政协工作现场会议，总结了寿张、郓城两县对社会人士进行工作的经验。之后，省、市和各地县政协对城市和散处在农村的社会人士，广泛地展开了教育改造工作。福建省政协指导当地民革组织联系了一千二百多人，紧紧抓住“学、看、做”三个主要环节，创造出来不少工作经验。河南省开封市政协创办农场工厂，吸收了很多社会人士和他们的家属参加生产，为国家创造很多财富。其他各地的实例很多，不再一一列举。这些社会人士，基本上属于旧社会的剥削阶级和旧知识分子，一般有接受社会主义改造和走资本主义道路的两面性。经过联系、进行教育改造工作之后，都有不同程度的进步。总的来说，就是在他们原有的政治思想的基础上，社会主义的因素在逐渐地扩大，资本主义的因素相对地在缩小。几年来，各地政协组织在社会联系工作上，积极贯彻服务与改造相结合的方针，为数很多的社会人士都参加了街道服务和劳动生产，其中还出现了不少先进工作者和先进集体。例如福州市在经常参加学习的社会人士二百八十人中，就有一百三十三人参加了街道各项工作，占参加学习人数的47.5％，其中有四十八人在去年工作上获得五十七人次的奖励，占参加人数的39.1％。陕西渭南社会人士种的卫星田，得到了红旗。泉州社会人士在服务与劳动生产上多次被评为先进集体和单位标兵。三十八个社会人士就获得八十一次的奖励。这种例子其他地方还有很多，甚至有的在技术革新方面作出了贡献，这是十分可喜的现象。实践证明，这些社会人士一般是可以接受社会主义改造，而且是可以改造好的。只要我们在这方面能更多地做些工作，就能使他们化消极为积极，为社会主义事业贡献力量。
    祖国面貌的日新月异是推动社会人士自我改造的有利形势
    现在，对社会人士进行工作，客观形势和主观条件，都是非常有利的。首先是在工作上有中共各级党委的具体领导，这是做好一切工作的根本保证。国际形势上，东风继续压倒西风，和平民主的力量在一天天地巩固和扩大。在国内，社会主义建设的全面大跃进，人民公社的巩固和发展，人民群众共产主义觉悟的空前提高，祖国面貌的日新月异，这都是推动和影响社会人士自我改造的有利形势。同时，由于社会制度的根本变化，这些社会人士已经失去他们原有阶级的经济基础，完全处于劳动人民的汪洋大海之中。公社化以后的农村面貌改变了，全国各城市正在开展组织生活组织生产的群众性的革命运动。如李富春副总理在报告中所说的：“现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动。这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。”对广大的社会人士来说，这一新的形势，有利于对他们的改造，也影响了他们自觉地要求改造。事实上，几年来由于他们有了一定的进步，一般确都具有自觉的改造愿望和服务的要求。加上过去我们在这一工作上，已经打下了基础，并且取得了一些经验，那么，我们就有必要而且有条件再进一步地去做这一工作。
    对这些人的政治立场和世界观的改造，虽然是长期的、艰巨的、反复的，但是只要我们能以“鼓足干劲、力争上游”的精神，对他们进行工作，就能够推动他们以“鼓足干劲、力争上游”的精神来很好地服务，尽快地改造。
    学习毛主席著作，投身到群众运动之中，走上社会主义的康庄大道
    联系社会人士工作，必须紧紧抓住思想教育这一中心环节。只有不断地对他们进行教育工作，才能提高他们的政治觉悟，推动政治改造，从而满足他们自觉的改造愿望。思想教育工作，是一项艰巨而又细致的工作，必须根据各个地方的不同情况，根据他们的具体特点，因地制宜，因人制宜。方式方法要多样化，和风细雨，因势利导。随时随地要政治挂帅，有批评、有鼓励。既不能操之过急，又不能放任自流；既要认识他们本质的一面，也要重视他们一点一滴的进步作用；既要照顾他们的特点，又要推动他们生活在劳动人民群众里面，接受新事物。在实际工作上，要把学习改造和服务实践密切结合一道。学是为了做，从做中来学，二者是互相推动互相促进的。学与做要随时同中心工作、群众运动结合起来。中心工作是什么，就学什么，做什么。群众运动起来了，就投身进去，在群众运动中受到教育锻炼。事实已经证明这是对社会人士教育改造的有效办法。
    对社会人士进行思想教育，必须帮助他们学习毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的典范，是马克思列宁主义的重大发展。我国从民主革命到社会主义革命和社会主义建设，所获得的一切伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。当前，总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这三个整个社会主义建设时期的法宝，就是毛泽东思想的产物。李富春、李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席在报告里都着重指出认真学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得越来越大的胜利的根本保证。所以我们帮助社会人士进行政治改造，就必须加强对他们进行毛泽东思想的教育。
    对社会人士团结教育改造的同时，有条件的地方对某些人士的家属，相应地做些工作，这是很必要的。李先念副总理在报告中指出：“组织人民经济生活，进一步发展集体福利事业和服务事业，使家务劳动社会化，这是社会主义建设的迫切要求之一。把人民生活组织得更好，就可以使人们鼓起更大的干劲，专心一意地从事生产劳动，就可以把更多的妇女从家务劳动中解放出来参加建设事业。”基于这种要求，我们如果能推动这些社会人士的家属参加服务和生产劳动，帮助他们学习进步，这不仅有利于发展生产，有利于集体生活，而且更可以和社会人士一道进行改造，起到互相影响的良好作用。
    总之，目前的大好形势，给我们提出了新的课题，也给我们做好工作提供了有利条件。我们有充分的信心，在共产党的正确领导下，通过我们的努力一定能够做、而且一定能够做好这一工作。帮助广大的社会人士和我们一道，愉快地走上社会主义的康庄大道，并为社会主义事业贡献力量。
    最后，让我为进一步开展对社会人士工作的重大成就而欢呼；为总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的伟大胜利而欢呼；为毛泽东思想的伟大胜利而欢呼！
