Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them. The situation in Xushui County, like in the rest of the country, is extremely good. Under the leadership of the Party, the 730,000 people of the county, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and vigorously engaging in mass movements, have achieved tremendous victories in the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1959 on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the county reached 146,690,000 yuan, an increase of 101% compared to the 72,830,000 yuan in 1958. Among this, the total industrial output value reached 35,030,000 yuan, an increase of 114.7% compared to the 16,320,000 yuan in 1958, and a six-fold increase compared to 1957. The variety of industrial products increased from 50 before communization to more than 550. The total agricultural output value reached 111,660,000 yuan, an increase of 97% compared to 1958. The proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 9% in 1958 to 24%. Agricultural modernization has also developed rapidly. Of the 1,520,000 mu of cultivated land in the county, 1,320,000 mu have been irrigated, accounting for 86.8% of the total cultivated land. Among them, 1,000,000 mu have achieved high-yield square fields with level ground like a mirror, straight ridges like lines, capable of irrigation and drainage, fertile soil, and convenient transportation. In addition to 202 standard units of tractors, the county also has 1,363 other pieces of machinery. Through mobilizing the masses, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously engaging in technical revolution, a total of 340,000 agricultural implements were reformed last year. Due to the reform of tools, labor was greatly saved. In the rural canteens, the number of cooks decreased from 18,047 to 10,580, with each person cooking for an average of 37.13 people increasing to 65.27 people, and many reaching 100 to 200 people, with the highest reaching more than 300 people. Rural electrification is also underway, with 21 new small-scale hydro and thermal power stations built in the county, with a power generation capacity of 2,207 kilowatts. The People's Communes in our county have embarked on a path of sound development after rectification, and have demonstrated tremendous superiority in developing production and realizing agricultural modernization. The masses say that the People's Commune is an "ironclad state and a golden rice bowl."

With the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's cultural and material living standards have also improved significantly. In recent years, the people of the county have resolutely responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, closely cooperated with production under the leadership of the Party, and continuously carried out large-scale health campaigns, significantly changing the county's sanitary conditions. One of the most prominent examples is the Xin'an People's Commune, which, under the kind care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, brought into play the power of the People's Commune and created the miracle of essentially eliminating mosquitoes in the Baiyangdian area. Now, I will report on their deeds.

Anyone who has read "Children of the Storm" knows that the revolutionary people of Baiyangdian during the Anti-Japanese War bravely fought against the Japanese invaders. The Xin'an People's Commune is the hometown of the heroes in "Children of the Storm" and also a famous water town. There is Baiyangdian in the south, and Yingjiadian and Dawangdian in the north. The commune has a total of 24 large and small lakes and ponds, and more than 290 ditches, which store water all year round and are a world for mosquito breeding. In the past, people told stories like myths: "The mosquitoes in Baiyangdian are as big as sparrows. If you are not careful, they will snatch a piece of meat from your body and fly to the roof to chew it." Of course, this is an exaggerated legend. However, the mosquitoes in Baiyangdian were indeed very fierce, and could bite through two layers of thin clothing.

In the past, there were not only many mosquitoes here, but also many rats, flies, and bedbugs. Every summer, it was truly "flies crawling all over the ground during the day, and mosquitoes covering the sky at night." The terrain here is low-lying, and the roads are uneven when it doesn't rain, and full of mud when it does. Plus, there was excrement everywhere, making it difficult for people to walk on the streets. Therefore, in the past, the Xin'an People's Commune had the saying of "five manys" and "six dirties." The "five manys" were: many mosquitoes, many flies, much garbage, much firewood ash, and much urine and feces. The "six dirties" were: "dirty riverbanks, dirty streets, dirty alleys, dirty courtyards, dirty houses, and dirty toilets." The "four pests" ran rampant, and poor environmental sanitation brought great harm to the people here. In the past, diseases such as malaria, epidemic "type B" encephalitis, kala-azar, dysentery, and typhoid fever were common here.

The current situation is completely different from the past. The world of mosquitoes and flies has become a civilized and happy water town. This earth-shaking change is inseparable from the economic development and improved living standards since liberation, and the long-term mass health campaigns. However, the greatest changes have occurred in the past two years. In 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the realization of rural People's Communes, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, which greatly encouraged the local Party committee and the people's confidence and determination to overcome natural disasters, and made them realize the great significance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene for transforming the world. With the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, relying on the tremendous advantages of the People's Communes with their wide scope and great strength, health work also achieved a Great Leap Forward. That year was a crucial year, and also the year with the greatest changes in sanitary conditions. In that year, the commune launched more than 40 health blitzes centered on eliminating mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were basically eliminated, and environmental sanitation was greatly improved. In that year, they filled in more than 7,000 mu of sewage pits and turned them into terraced fields, built more than 1,000 mu of fish ponds, and carried out large-scale improvements to toilets, livestock sheds, pigsties, and streets, effectively eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds. In 1959, with the spirit of continuous revolution, they continued to launch a mosquito extermination war, not only consolidating the victorious achievements of health work in 1958, but also further improving the level of health work.

The Xin'an People's Commune has eliminated mosquitoes, which is a great victory for the Party's leadership. Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for the elimination of the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases, this commune, under the leadership and care of the higher Party committee, has always adhered to implementing the Central Committee's call, adhered to putting politics in command, and the secretary personally grasping health work. From the commune to the production team, Party organizations at all levels organized pest control and disease elimination headquarters, led by the first secretary and the secretary in charge of culture and education, clarifying tasks and dividing areas. Branch secretaries and committee members were assigned to specific areas, trained mosquito extermination backbones, and personally directed the mosquito extermination war. During the movement, with the branch as the core, creation meetings were held, mobilizing everyone to offer ideas and think of ways to vigorously grasp inventions and creations. Party Committee Secretary Yuan Jinduo personally observed the activity patterns of mosquitoes and came up with many effective methods of control. He observed that mosquitoes fly high when the sun is about to set, fly low when it is dark, run outside when smoked indoors, and run inside when smoked outside. He created a method of lighting fires in one place and causing smoke to billow everywhere, eliminating mosquitoes inside and outside the village with internal and external attacks, which played a great role in eliminating adult mosquitoes. The commune Party committee did not stop at general calls in leading health work, but adopted a leadership method of grasping one red point to promote the overall situation. No matter which village, even a backward village, as long as there was a little advanced experience, they would hold on-site meetings to comprehensively promote it, so that advanced experience could be quickly popularized. Since the launch of the four pests elimination campaign in 1956, sanitary conditions have improved. However, people still had no confidence in eliminating mosquitoes. Young people shook their heads, and old people did not believe it even more. They said: "Baiyangdian has been the world of mosquitoes since ancient times, and eliminating mosquitoes is extremely difficult." Some said: "We have lived here for dozens of generations and have no way to deal with mosquitoes. What magical methods can there be now!" Others said: "Mosquitoes are a sin left by the emperor to the people of Baiyangdian, and they cannot be changed." Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, superstitions have been broken, thinking has been liberated, and people have generally put forward the demand to eliminate mosquitoes. In order to unify thinking and understanding, the Party committee first launched a mass debate among all commune members. The center of the debate was: Can humans do it? Or can mosquitoes do it? The conclusion of the debate was: Humans can eliminate mosquitoes, "Humans can do it," "Mosquitoes are incompetent." Immediately after, the commune Party committee issued a general offensive order to eliminate mosquitoes. After a three-day and three-night battle, they finally created a model of basically no mosquitoes in Nanliuzhuang. The commune Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting and launched the second battle. After about ten days, Yangdikou Village also eliminated mosquitoes and surpassed Nanliuzhuang. The commune Party committee held a second on-site meeting. In order to educate the masses, many old men were invited to participate in the meeting. Large gas lamps were lit at night, and they took off their backs and held the meeting in the open air. As a result, no mosquitoes bit them. People were extremely happy, and the old men kept shouting, "Strange!" "The Communist Party can do anything. As long as you follow the Party, you can pick the moon from the sky." On the spot, each village expressed its determination to learn from Yangdikou and eliminate mosquitoes. After the meeting, a mass mosquito extermination campaign was generally launched throughout the commune, setting off the third mosquito extermination climax. The old men who participated in the meeting became the most active mosquito extermination propagandists, talking about it everywhere they went. After more than ten days of fighting, the commune Party committee held the third on-site meeting in Dazhangzhuang and launched the fourth mosquito extermination climax. After three on-site meetings and four climaxes, nineteen of the commune's forty-six villages achieved basically no mosquitoes, and the mosquitoes in other villages were also greatly reduced. In the past year, the commune Party committee held 28 on-site meetings and promptly promoted advanced experience. The entire commune has achieved basically no mosquitoes, and no one says that mosquitoes cannot be eliminated in Baiyangdian anymore. The masses were jubilant and praised unanimously, "The Communist Party has good policies, the People's Commune is strong, production leaps forward every year, mosquitoes and flies are swept away, everyone is healthy and does not get sick: the old become young."

Under the unified leadership of the Party, more than 40,000 people in the Xin'an People's Commune contributed ideas, offered suggestions, and showed their abilities. They combined indigenous and foreign methods, treated both the symptoms and the root causes, and focused on treating the root causes. In a few months, the masses created more than 300 methods to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. Yang Hunzi, a commune member in Dazhangzhuang, created a mosquito-killing lamp. The lamp was placed in a pond, attracting mosquitoes and fish at night. Mosquitoes would hit the lamp and fall into the water, and the fish would eat the mosquitoes, which both eliminated the mosquitoes and benefited fish farming. The masses also created earthen rockets (tying mosquito-killing medicine to "firecrackers" and exploding them at low altitudes in reed fields and rice paddies), earthen poisonous gas, smoke cannons, high-altitude smoke cannons (all smoke agents, suitable for smoking mosquitoes in outdoor reed fields, rice paddies, trees, and eaves), hanging pants (hanging worn pants upside down, tightening the cuffs, supporting the waist, hanging them up at night and taking them in in the morning, so that mosquitoes can crawl into the pants and be scalded to death with boiling water), three-eyed guns (loading gunpowder and 666 powder into the earthen gun, firing one shot in a toilet, and the mosquitoes and flies can be swept away), etc. In terms of tactics, they created encirclement battles (everyone holding smoke agents and encircling large areas of reed fields and rice paddies), long snake formations (simultaneously igniting smoke agents on the water's edge and embankments), ten thousand lights (hanging mosquito-killing lamps in reed fields and rice paddies), uprooting (dredging aquatic plants in the water, clearing weeds on the banks, dredging ditches, and treating sewage to cut off the mosquitoes' offspring), internal and external attacks (simultaneously smoking indoors, in courtyards, in villages, and in fields), etc. In terms of time, seizing the two favorable times before mosquitoes take off at dusk and before they rest at dawn has the greatest effect. In order to destroy the mosquito and fly nests, they universally promoted "eight overturns" and "five improvements" in combination with production and life, namely: overturning toilets, overturning livestock sheds, overturning chicken and duck coops, overturning threshing grounds, overturning manure pits, overturning pigsties, overturning the bottom of manure piles, and overturning garbage pits. Toilets were transformed into toilets with squatting pits and mosquito and fly prevention facilities, achieving daily production and daily cleaning, and implementing harmless treatment of feces. Chicken and duck coops were changed to three-story buildings, with the first floor for manure, the middle floor for sleeping, and the upper floor for laying eggs. The well platforms of water wells were raised, enlarged, and equipped with windlasses or waterwheels. Where there were no water wells, fixed water lifting docks were universally established. Pigsties were moved outside the village, the walls were plastered smooth, and the ground was compacted, effectively eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds.

The Xin'an Commune Party Committee grasped the dialectical relationship between health for production and production for health. The Commune Party Committee always cared about the masses' production and life, and deeply recognized the serious harm that the "four pests," especially mosquitoes, brought to the production and life of the people in Baiyangdian. Therefore, while leading the masses in production, they paid great attention to caring for the lives of the masses. It was precisely because they correctly treated the relationship between production and health that health was closely integrated with production, achieving the goal of promoting production. For the past two years, they have adhered to the principle of "five combinations." The "five combinations" are: (1) Handling pits, depressions, ditches, and channels, combined with water conservancy construction and terraced field construction, eliminated mosquitoes and benefited production; (2) "Eight overturns" and "five improvements" combined with fertilizer accumulation expanded fertilizer sources and improved environmental sanitation; (3) Combining the strength of the masses with professional teams achieved hygiene in every household, and professional teams accumulated more fertilizer; (4) Harmless treatment of feces and garbage increased fertilizer and improved fertilizer efficiency, eliminating the media of infectious diseases and crop pests; (5) Unified leadership, unified arrangements, unified inspection, unified evaluation, and unified reporting and summary of production and health. Paying attention to hygiene starts from production, doing whatever production needs, not forgetting hygiene in production, and making hygiene closely follow production no matter how busy production is. Through the development of the health campaign, fertilizer has greatly increased, and their grain yield has increased year by year. In 1957, the yield per mu was 91 jin, in 1958, the yield per mu reached 251 jin, and last year it leaped to 504 jin.

With the development of production, the improvement of living standards, and the improvement of sanitary conditions, the people's mental outlook has also undergone tremendous changes. Everywhere in the Xin'an People's Commune, there are scenes of people's hearts being uplifted, feeling comfortable, smiling, and working happily. On the basis of victory, in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, they have put forward new and greater goals and tasks, determined to thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the "four pests" this year, not allowing the "four pests" to revive, vigorously carrying out the movement of disease-free households and disease-free teams, further improving sanitary conditions, and making people live a happier and better life.

The victory of the Xin'an People's Commune in eliminating mosquitoes fully proves that the great call of our Party to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases is great and correct. It fully reflects the Party and Chairman Mao's kind concern for the people of the whole country, fully demonstrates the tremendous superiority of the People's Commune, and is a great victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the mass movement. The above is the main situation of mosquito extermination in the Xin'an People's Commune.

Although our county's health work has achieved not small results in general, the development of health work in the county is not balanced enough, and the overall health work cannot adapt to the needs of the current new situation of production development and improved living standards. It is still far from meeting the requirements of eliminating diseases, inspiring everyone, changing customs, and transforming the world. We are determined to follow the instructions of the Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees on health work, with the first secretary in charge at all levels, making a big splash, creating momentum, publicizing widely, mobilizing the whole Party, mobilizing all the people, eliminating the four pests, and carrying out health work in a big way, launching a mass patriotic health competition movement to learn from Jishan, catch up with Jishan, and surpass Jishan. Comprehensively promote the collective health care system, organize medical personnel to go deep into work, deep into the fields, workshops, and other production front lines, comprehensively organize and guide the masses' life hygiene, everyone loves cleanliness, every household pays attention to hygiene, thoroughly eliminates the four pests, thoroughly eliminates diseases that seriously endanger the people, and realizes the great goal of changing customs and transforming the world.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech,
Please criticize and correct me, Chairman and fellow representatives.

    人民公社威力巨大　水乡新安基本无蚊
    张国忠代表谈徐水白洋淀一带环境卫生工作的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和常务委员会的工作报告，并保证坚决贯彻执行。徐水县和全国各地一样，形势极为良好。全县七十三万人民在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社，大搞群众运动，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了1959年连续大跃进的巨大胜利。1959年全县工农业总产值达到一亿四千六百六十九万元，比1958年的七千二百八十三万元增长101％，其中：工业总产值达到三千五百零三万元，比1958年的一千六百三十二万元增长114.7％，比1957年增长六倍，工业产品由公社化前五十种，增到五百五十多种；农业总产值达到一亿一千一百六十六万元，比1958年增长97％，工业产值占工农业总产值由1958年的9％，增到24％。农业现代化也有迅速发展，全县一百五十二万亩耕地，已有一百三十二万亩实现了水浇地，占总耕地的86.8％，其中一百万亩达到地平如镜、埂直如线、能浇能排、肥多地壮、交通方便的丰产方田了。全县除有拖拉机二百零二个标准台外，尚有其它机具一千三百六十三件。经过发动群众，土洋并举，大闹技术革命，去年一年共改革各种农具三十四万件，由于工具的改革，大大节省了劳动力，只做饭一项全县农村食堂由原有炊事员一万八千零四十七人下降为一万零五百八十人，由平均每人做三十七点一三人的饭增到每人做六十五点二七人的饭，不少的达一、二百人，最高者达到三百多人。农村电气化也在着手，全县新建小型水、火电站二十一处，发电能力达二千二百零七瓩。我县的人民公社经过整顿已经走上了健全发展的道路，在发展生产实现农业的现代化方面发挥了巨大的优越性，群众说人民公社是：“铁打的江山金饭碗”。
    随着工农业生产大发展，人民的文化物质生活水平也有了显著的提高。几年来，全县人民坚决响应党和毛主席的号召，在党的领导下，紧密配合生产，连续开展了多次大规模的卫生运动，显著的改变了全县的卫生面貌。其中比较突出的是新安人民公社，它在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥人民公社威力，创造了淀泊基本无蚊的奇迹，现在我把它们的事迹作一汇报。
    凡是读过“新儿女英雄传”的人，谁都知道抗日时期白洋淀的革命人民曾向日寇进行过英勇的斗争，而新安人民公社正是“新儿女英雄传”中英雄的家乡，也是个有名的水乡，南有白洋淀、北有营家淀、大王淀，全社共大小淀泊二十四处，壕沟二百九十多条，常年储水，是蚊子繁殖的世界。过去人们像神话一样地讲着
  “白洋淀的蚊子像麻雀那么大，一不小心，从人身上叼去一块肉，飞到屋顶上咯吱咯吱嚼着吃”。当然，这是夸张的传说。不过白洋淀的蚊子确实很厉害，穿上两层单衣服也可被蚊子叮透。
    这里过去不光蚊子多，老鼠、苍蝇、臭虫也非常多。每到夏天，真是“白天苍蝇爬满地，晚上蚊子遮住天”。这里地势低下，道路上是不下雨高凹不平，一下雨满街稀泥，加上到处都是粪便，人们从街走过，简直无从下脚。所以，过去新安人民公社有“五多”、“六脏”之说。“五多”是：蚊多、蝇多、垃圾多、柴灰多、尿屎多。“六脏”是：“河边脏、街道脏、胡同脏、院子脏、住屋脏、厕所脏”。“四害”横行，环境卫生不良，给这里的人民带来了极大的祸害。过去，这里经常流行疟疾、流行性“乙型”脑炎、黑热病、痢疾和伤寒等病。
    现在的情况和过去的情况整整翻了个过。蚊蝇世界变成了文明幸福的水乡了。这个社在环境卫生方面，普遍做到五洁（室内外、厨房、家具、院落、街道），主要街道都设有垃圾箱和土痰盂。个人卫生方面做到了“五勤”（勤洗澡、理发、换衣服、晒被褥、剪指甲），全社四万九千四百八十一人中有三万五千四百人做到刷牙漱口，占总人数70％以上。各个食堂在1959年都建立隔山灶，做到“做饭不见柴”。最近二十八个食堂又利用“废气”做饭，做到了“做饭不用火”热的快、用人少、不烧煤柴、炊事员的劳动强度小。因此，社员称颂说：“废气变财宝，卫生又节约，一机能多用，办法实在好”。在幼儿园里都设有洗手池，作到“流水洗手脸、一人一巾”；还有保健室，经常对孩子进行身体检查和一般治疗，每个孩子都有保健档案。这些孩子们一个个红光满面，活泼可爱，都学说普通话。今年以来，这个公社又实行“集体保健医疗制度”，每个社员每年交医疗费五角，每次看病只拿一角手续费，医疗费由公社统一调剂使用，如果不够，由公社公益金补助。最近，这个社又组织医务人员进行全民健康检查，建立健康档案，普治现患，预防新患。这些办法受到了社员的普遍欢迎。
    新安人民公社，基本消灭蚊蝇，卫生面貌大大改观，这个翻天复地的变化，是与解放以后经济发展和生活提高，长期开展群众卫生运动分不开的。但是巨大的变化还是在最近两年。1958年随着工农业生产大跃进，农村人民公社化的实现，中共中央和国务院又发布了除四害讲卫生的指示，大大鼓舞了当地党委和人民战胜自然灾害的信心和决心，使他们认识到消灭四害、讲究卫生对改造世界的重大意义。随着生产大跃进的洪流，依靠人民公社范围广，力量大的巨大优越性，卫生工作也实现了大跃进，这一年是关键性的一年，也是卫生面貌变化最大的一年，在这一年里全社开展以消灭蚊子为中心的卫生突击运动四十次之多。基本上消灭了蚊子，环境卫生大大改善。在这一年中，他们共填平污水坑，垫成台田达七千多亩，修建了养鱼池一千多亩，厕所、畜棚、猪圈、街道等普遍进行了大改良，有效地消灭了蚊蝇孳生地。1959年他们又以不断革命的精神，继续展开了灭蚊大战，不但巩固了1958年卫生工作的胜利成果，而且使卫生工作水平有了更大的提高。
    新安人民公社消灭了蚊子，是党的领导的伟大胜利。自从党中央和毛主席号召除四害，讲卫生，消灭疾病以来，这个公社在上级党委领导和关怀下，一直坚持贯彻中央这个号召，坚持政治挂帅，书记亲自抓卫生工作。从公社到生产队各级党组织都组织了除害灭病指挥部，由第一书记和管文教的书记挂帅，明确任务，划分区域。支部书记和委员分片包干，培养灭蚊骨干，亲自指挥灭蚊大战。运动中以支部为核心，召开了创造会，发动人人出主意，个个想办法，大抓发明创造。党委书记袁金铎，亲自观察蚊子活动规律，想出了许多除治的有效办法，他观察到太阳快落时蚊子飞的高，天黑时飞的低，屋里熏向外跑，外边熏往屋跑的特点，创造了一处点火处处冒烟、村里村外、内外夹攻消灭蚊子的方法，在消灭成蚊中起了很大作用。公社党委在领导卫生工作中不是停留在一般号召上，而是采取了抓一点红，推动全盘的领导方法，不论那一村，即使是落后村、只要有一点先进经验就召开现场会议全面推广，使先进经验迅速普及。自1956年开展除四害运动以来，卫生情况有了改善。但是人们对于消灭蚊子，仍然没有信心，青年人摇头，老年人更不相信。他们说：“白洋淀自古就是蚊子的世界，消灭蚊子难上难”。有的说：“在这里住了几十辈子，对蚊子都没有办法，现在能有什么妙法！”也有人说：“蚊子是皇帝给白洋淀人民留下的罪，变不了”。1958年大跃进以来，破除了迷信，解放了思想，人们普遍提出了消灭蚊子的要求。为了统一思想认识党委首先在全体社员中开展了一次全民性的大辩论，辩论的中心是人能？还是蚊子能？辩论的结论是：人能消灭蚊子，“人能”，“蚊子无能”。紧接着公社党委下达了消灭蚊子的总攻击令，经过三天三夜的大战，终于在南刘庄创造了基本无蚊的典范。公社党委立即召开了现场会议，并发动了第二次战役。经过十天左右，漾堤口村又消灭了蚊子，并且超过了南刘庄。公社党委又召开了第二次现场会议。为了教育群众，邀请了许多老头参加了会议，晚上点着大汽灯，脱光了脊背在露天里开会，结果没有蚊子咬，人们高兴极了，老头们直嚷嚷“怪事！”“共产党什么都能，只要跟着党走，天边的月亮都摘下来了”。当场各村都表示决心学习漾堤口，消灭蚊子。会后，全社又普遍开展了群众性的灭蚊运动，掀起了第三次灭蚊高潮，参加会的老头们，成了最积极的灭蚊宣传员，逢人说到处讲。经过了十几天的战斗，公社党委又在大张庄召开了第三次现场会，发动了第四次灭蚊高潮。经过三次现场会，四次高潮，全公社的四十六个村，有十九个村达到基本无蚊，其他村的蚊子也大为减少。去年一年来，公社党委又召开了二十八次现场会，及时推广了先进经验。全公社都实现了基本无蚊，再也听不到人说白洋淀不能消灭蚊子了。群众欢欣鼓舞，众口赞颂、“共产党、好主张，人民公社力量强，生产年年大跃进，蚊子苍蝇一扫光，人人健康不生病：老头变成少年郎”。
    新安人民公社四万多人在党的统一领导下，人人献计，个个献策，各显其能，土洋并举，标本兼治，以治本为主。几个月时间，群众就创造了消灭蚊蝇的方法三百多种。大张庄社员杨混子创造了灭蚊灯，把灯放在水塘里，蚊子夜间奔亮鱼也奔亮，蚊子碰在灯上落水，鱼便吃了蚊子，既消灭了蚊子，又利于养鱼。群众创造的还有土火箭（把灭蚊药拴在“二踢脚”上，在苇地和稻田低空爆炸）、土毒瓦斯，烟炮、高空烟炮（均为烟熏剂，实用于野外苇田、稻田、树上、房檐上熏蚊）、吊裤子（把穿的裤子倒吊起来，裤脚扎紧，裤腰撑圆，晚上吊，早晨收，蚊子钻进裤子去用开水烫死）、三眼枪（在土枪里装上火药和六六六粉，一个厕所放一枪，蚊蝇即可一扫光）等等。在战术上创造了围歼战（人人手执烟熏剂，向大面积苇地、稻田围攻）、长蛇阵（在水边上、堤岸上同时燃点烟熏剂）、万家灯（苇地、稻田齐挂灭蚊灯）、连根拔（打捞水中苲菜、铲除岸边杂草、疏通沟渠、处理污水等，使蚊子断子绝孙）、内外夹攻（室内、院内、村内、田野同时熏杀）等等。在时间上，抓住傍晚蚊子起飞前和黎明栖息前这两个有利时机，效果最大。为了捣毁蚊蝇老巢，结合生产生活普遍推行了“八翻”“五改良”，即：翻厕所、翻牲畜棚、翻鸡鸭窝、翻碾磨道、翻粪坑、翻猪圈、翻粪堆底、翻垃圾坑。把厕所改成为有蹲坑，有防蚊蝇设备的厕所，作到日产日清，并且实行粪便无害化处理。把鸡鸭窝改为三层楼式，一层放粪，中层睡觉，上层生蛋。把水井井台加高，加大，加辘轳或水车，没有水井的地方，普遍固定提水码头。把猪圈移到村外，四壁抹光，地面砸实，有效的消灭了蚊蝇孳生地。
    新安公社党委掌握卫生为生产，生产讲卫生这一辩证关系。公社党委时时关心群众的生产生活，深刻认识到“四害”特别是蚊子给白洋淀人民生产生活带来的严重危害，因此，在领导群众生产的同时，很注意关心群众的生活。正是由于他们正确地对待生产和卫生的关系，因此使卫生作到了紧密结合生产，达到了促进生产的目的。两年来，他们一直坚持了“五结合”的原则，“五结合”是：（一）处理坑、洼、沟、渠，结合兴修水利，整建台田，消灭了蚊子，有利生产；（二）“八翻”“五改良”结合积肥，扩大了肥源，改善了环境卫生；（三）群众力量与专业队相结合，达到家家户户讲卫生，专业队积肥多；（四）粪便垃圾实行无害化处理，增加肥料、提高肥效，消灭了传染病的媒介和农作物害虫；（五）生产与卫生统一领导，统一安排，统一检查，统一评比，统一汇报总结。讲卫生从生产出发，生产需要什么就干什么，生产不忘卫生，生产越忙，越使卫生紧紧跟上。通过卫生运动的开展，肥料大大增加，他们的粮食产量逐年提高，1957年亩产九十一斤，1958年亩产达到二百五十一斤，去年又跃增到五百零四斤。
    生产发展了，生活提高了，卫生面貌改善了，人们的精神面貌也起了巨大变化。在新安人民公社到处都出现了人心振奋，心情舒畅，笑逐颜开，愉快劳动的景象。他们在胜利的基础上，根据不断革命的精神，又提出了新的更伟大的奋斗目标和任务，决心在今年彻底、干净地消灭“四害”，不叫“四害”死灰复燃，大力开展无病户，无病队运动，进一步改善卫生条件，让人民生活得更幸福美好。
    新安人民公社消灭蚊子的胜利充分证明我们党提出的除四害、讲卫生，消灭疾病的伟大号召，是伟大正确的。充分体现了党和毛主席对全国人民亲切关怀，充分显示出人民公社的巨大优越性，是总路线、大跃进、群众运动的伟大胜利。以上是新安人民公社灭蚊主要情况。
    我县的卫生工作，从总的方面来讲虽取得了不小的成绩，但是全县卫生工作发展还不够平衡，整个卫生工作还不能适应当前生产发展和生活提高新形势的需要，距离消灭疾病、人人振奋、移风易俗改造世界的要求还差很远。我们决心根据中央、省、市委对卫生工作的指示，层层由第一书记挂帅，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大作宣传，全党动员，全民动手，大除四害，大搞卫生工作，开展学稷山、赶稷山、超稷山的群众性的爱国卫生竞赛运动。全面推行集体保健医疗制度，组织医务人员深入工作，深入田间、车间等生产第一线，全面组织和指导群众生活卫生，人人爱清洁，户户讲卫生，彻底消灭四害，彻底消灭严重危害人民的疾病，实现移风易俗，改造世界的伟大目的。
    以上发言有不妥之处
    请主席、各位代表同志批评指正。
