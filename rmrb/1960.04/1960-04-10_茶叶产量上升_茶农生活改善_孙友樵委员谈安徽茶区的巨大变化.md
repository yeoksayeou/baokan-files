Chairman, fellow members:

I listened to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I feel extremely excited, greatly educated, and encouraged. I express my resolute support.

The great situation in our motherland is truly one where the mountains are changing, the waters are changing, and everything is undergoing earth-shattering transformations. The poor and backward face of old China has become a historical relic, never to return. This fully proves the correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and proves that the three "Long Live" slogans are fully in line with the strong aspirations of the 650 million people. They have penetrated deeply into people's hearts, exerted unparalleled power, and thus achieved unprecedented great victories.

This is true for the whole country, and it is also true for our Anhui. Historically, Anhui was a disaster-ridden and extremely poor area before liberation. After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, it has undergone fundamental changes, just like the rest of the country. For example, the Huai River, which caused disasters for thousands of years, is now tamed to benefit the people. At the same time, the river network system in northern Anhui is being realized. Wherever the river network system has been realized, it is now "fragrant with rice flowers all over northern Anhui," becoming a scene of Jiangnan. Furthermore, there was originally no industrial base, but now a heavy industry base including steel, coal, and copper has been formed. Agriculture encountered severe droughts for a hundred days in both 1958 and 1959, but it overcame natural disasters and achieved bumper harvests. All other aspects have also seen comprehensive leaps forward and tremendous changes. These astonishing miracles are truly deeply moving, and I don't know where to begin. Now, I will briefly talk about the development of tea production in our province.

Past: Tea gardens were largely barren, and production declined year by year; Now: Tea gardens are expanding, and production is increasing year by year.

Our province's tea production has a long history and is one of the major tea-producing areas in the country. The "Qihong" and "Tunlv" produced are rich in fragrance and famous throughout the world, enjoying a very high reputation in the international market. "Maofeng," "Hou Kui," "Guapian," and "Orchid" teas are also sold well throughout the country and are extremely popular. However, in the past, under the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social system, production was extremely abnormal. Before liberation, due to the destruction and devastation of the reactionary rule, coupled with the exploitation of tea farmers by bureaucratic capital, comprador classes, and unscrupulous merchants, a large number of tea gardens were deserted, and production declined year by year. As a result, in the year of liberation – 1949 – the total tea production of the province was only 100,000 dan. After liberation, the Party and the government gave great care and support to the production and life of the people in the tea-producing areas, and adopted production measures that "emphasize both restoration and development, and emphasize both tea picking and tea garden management," so that tea production was rapidly restored and developed. In the tea-producing areas, as in other areas, mutual aid and cooperation movements were launched. In particular, the realization of people's communes in 1958 opened up extremely broad avenues for tea production, making tea production rise year by year and tea garden area expand year by year. For example, in 1949, the average yield of each mu of tea garden was only 23 jin, which had increased to 98 jin by 1958. High-yield tea gardens also appeared, with a yield as high as 2,503 jin per mu. While striving to increase the yield per mu, various places also actively opened up new tea gardens. In 1949, the province had only 450,000 mu of semi-barren tea gardens, which had expanded to 880,000 mu by 1958, an increase of nearly one-fold. Since last year, there has been further expansion. The total tea production of the province rose to 393,000 dan in 1957, an increase of nearly four-fold compared with 1949. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the production surged to 550,000 dan, equivalent to five and a half times that of 1949. Last year, there was also a large increase. This is the general situation of the province. Specifically, looking at the "Qihong" producing area – Qimen – it is even more astonishing. On the eve of liberation – 1948 – the production of "Qihong" fell to 3,789 dan. After liberation, it rose year by year, and in 1958, the production saw a great leap forward, reaching 72,716 dan, an increase of more than 19 times compared with 1949. From this figure, we can clearly see that the world-renowned "Qihong" was on its last breath on the eve of liberation. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, did it recover. Otherwise, the future of "Qihong" would have been unimaginable.

Past: Tea farmers' lives were such that they did not have enough to eat, nor enough to wear; thatched cottages were crumbling; Now: Poverty and disease are thrown away together, with enough to eat, enough to wear, and culture

Now, I would like to talk about the living conditions of tea farmers: Before liberation, due to the gradual decline of tea production, the lives of people in tea-producing areas were very poor. They did not have enough to eat, nor enough to wear. Thatched cottages were crumbling. They described their lives at the time, and a sad folk song circulated:

"No rice for the chickens to eat during the day, no grain for the rats at night, the lapel serves as a rice bucket, the palm serves as a salt jar."

"Straw sandals grow on their feet every year, straw raincoats serve as quilts."

But what are their living conditions today? In addition to building new houses, adding furniture and bedding, and everyone wearing new clothes, greatly improving their lives, they also have surplus money to deposit in the bank. For example, in Qimen County, with a population of more than 80,000, the total amount of money saved in the bank by the people of the county at the end of each year was: 27,000 yuan in 1951, 872,000 yuan in 1956, and 5,459,000 yuan in 1958. This shows that production is gradually increasing, and life is gradually improving accordingly. Recalling the miserable life before liberation, when "bran and vegetables were half a year's food, and one set of clothes lasted ten years," it is now gone forever. Therefore, they feel that the Party is the savior of the people. Recalling the past, they hate the destruction of the reactionary rule. The people in the Qimen tea-producing area are now singing like this:

"Thinking of before liberation, the suffering is endless;
Smokes from the kitchen are cut off in the villages, tea gardens are desolate.
Output and quality have declined, and Qihong's reputation has fallen to a thousand feet;
The tea area people's history of blood and tears, the more you think about it, the more you hate and the more painful it becomes.
Since the Communist Party came, Qimen has seen the sun from now on,
Qihong has a bumper harvest every year, the output and quality have turned several times,
Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water, turning over depends entirely on the Communist Party."

Before liberation, the people in the tea-producing areas could not talk about reading and writing due to the poverty of life. Therefore, almost all tea farmers were illiterate. But now every place has schools for adults and children, and illiteracy has been basically eliminated. Before liberation, people in tea-producing areas had no doctors and no medicine when they got sick. After liberation, clinics, health stations, and maternity hospitals were established everywhere, and health was guaranteed. They also sing happily:

"The sun shines in the deep mountains, poverty and disease are thrown away together,
Have enough to eat, enough to wear, and have culture, and better days are ahead."

From the above production and life of the people in the tea-producing areas, who can say that this is not a picture with extremely clear contrasts between the old and the new?

Tea farmers recall the past and compare it with the present, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher

Recalling the past, they feel like it was a lifetime ago. Therefore, they are in a happy mood, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. They are doing everything possible to cultivate tea gardens and reform tools. Now, all foreign tea factories have been mechanized, and communes and teams have established initial processing factories, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually creating and reforming many tea-making equipment. At the same time, they have improved operating methods, and many fast tea picking experts have emerged among them, such as the creation of the method of picking tea with both hands, which greatly improved the efficiency of tea picking. Zhang Qinghe, a girl from She County, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, mustered greater efforts, studied diligently, and with the help of the Party organization of the commune and team, created a record of picking 550 jin of fresh leaves a day in 1958. At the beginning of the spring tea in 1959, she actively taught the technology to the commune members, and she herself broke the record of picking a thousand jin a day. Tatiana Tkeibuchava, a tea-picking expert from Soviet Georgia, wrote a letter to Zhang Qinghe, expressing her enthusiasm and hope to establish friendship with her. Zhang Qinghe said in her reply to her: "I am an ordinary tea-picking girl. I should give credit to the Party for my achievements in tea production." It shows the greatness of the Party's education that a young rural girl can have such a high degree of awareness and internationalist spirit. Now they often sing folk songs happily in the tea garden:

"A piece of tea leaf, a piece of heart, a basket of tea leaves, a basket of gold,
Deeply filled with green leaves, sent to the benefactor Chairman Mao."

Their feelings of gratitude and joy are intertwined, how exciting!

As mentioned above, the changes in tea production and the lives of people in tea-producing areas in our province, like other aspects, are extremely great. In general, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the incomparably superior socialist system, and under the glorious banner of the three "Long Live" slogans, everything is changing, every corner is changing, and they are all changing deeply towards the road of prosperity and happiness. From this, thinking about my own transformation, the great situation of the motherland is developing forward at a rate of one day equals twenty years. The whole society is leaping forward, and I must adapt to the objective situation, catch up quickly, accelerate my own transformation, and closely follow the wheels of the times.

The Party teaches us to understand the objective laws of social development and grasp our own destiny, which is to teach us that the subjective must conform to the objective. Especially recently, at the two representative conferences of our Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Party earnestly instructed us to "take care of one end, and lean to one side." We deeply feel the greatness and warmth of the Party's patient persuasion, which embodies the policy of peaceful transformation everywhere. Now the people of the whole country are under the great situation of the three red banners, going all out, and vigorously building socialism. I should be determined to take care of one end – wholeheartedly take care of the interests of the country and the people; lean to one side – lean to the side of socialism. Only in this way can we conform to objective laws, grasp our own destiny, and continue to move forward with the people of the whole country.

The above speech, if there are any inappropriate points, please criticize and correct.

    茶叶产量上升　茶农生活改善
    孙友樵委员谈安徽茶区的巨大变化主席、各位委员：
    我听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，感到万分兴奋，受到极大的教育和鼓舞，表示坚决拥护。
    我们祖国当前的伟大形势，真是山也在变化，水也在变化，一切都在翻天复地的变化，旧中国贫穷落后的面貌，已成为历史上的陈迹，一去不复返了。这就充分证明了中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明正确，证明了三个万岁是完全符合六亿五千万人民的强烈愿望，它已深入人心，发挥了无比的威力，从而获得了史无前例的伟大胜利。
    全国如此，我们安徽也是如此。可是，我们安徽解放前在历史上是一个多灾多难、一穷二白的地区。解放后，由于党和毛主席的正确领导，和全国各地一样，发生了根本性的变化。如千百年来的淮河灾祸，现在已驯服地为民造福，同时还正在实现淮北的河网化，凡是实现了河网化的地方，已是“千里淮北稻花香”，变成一片江南的景象了。再说工业本来没有基础，而现在却形成了钢铁煤铜等重工业基地；农业在1958、1959两年中，都遇到百日未雨的大旱，然而却战胜了自然灾害，取得了大丰收；还有其他各方面，都是全面的跃进，发生了巨大的变化。这些惊人的奇迹，实在是令人感动至深至切，不知从何处谈起。现在只就我省茶叶生产方面的发展情况简单地来谈一谈。
    过去茶园大量荒芜，产量逐年下降；现在茶园扩大，产量逐年上升
    我省茶叶生产，有着悠久的历史，为全国主要茶区之一。所产的“祁红”、“屯绿”，香味浓郁，驰名世界，在国际市场上享有很高的声誉；“毛峰”、“猴?”、“瓜片”、“兰花”等茶，也畅销全国各地，极受欢迎。但是，过去处在半封建、半殖民地的社会制度下，生产是极不正常的。解放前由于反动统治的破坏与摧残，加上官僚资本、买办阶级和奸商的压榨茶农，使茶园大量荒芜，产量逐年下降，以致到解放那年——1949年，全省茶叶产量只不过十万担。解放后，党和政府对茶区人民的生产和生活，给予了极大的关怀和支持，采取“恢复与发展并重、采茶与管理茶园并重”的生产措施，使茶叶生产得到迅速恢复和发展。在茶区中，和其他地区一样，开展互助合作运动，特别是1958年实现了人民公社化，更给茶叶生产开辟了极为广阔的道路，使茶叶生产逐年上升，茶园面积逐年扩大。如：1949年，每亩茶园平均只产二十三斤，到1958年已提高到九十八斤，并出现了高额丰产茶园，亩产竟高达二千五百零三斤。在努力提高亩产的同时，各地还积极开辟新的茶园。1949年全省只有半荒的茶园四十五万亩，及至1958年已扩大到八十八万亩，增长将近一倍，去年以来又有了进一步的扩大。全省茶叶的总产量，1957年上升到三十九万三千担，比1949年增长近四倍；到大跃进的1958年，产量激增到五十五万担，等于1949年的五倍半，去年也有很大的增长。这是全省总的情况。具体到“祁红”产区——祁门来看，更属惊人。解放前夕——1948年，“祁红”产量降至三千七百八十九担。解放后逐年上升，到1958年的产量出现大跃进，达到七万二千七百一十六担，比1949年增长十九倍多。从这个数字上我们很清楚地看到这个驰名世界的“祁红”，在解放前夕已是奄奄一息了，只有当解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，才获得了复苏，否则“祁红”的前途将是不堪设想的。
    过去：茶农的生活，食不果腹，衣不蔽体；茅棚草屋，东倒西歪；现在是：贫穷疾病一起丢，有吃有穿有文化
    现在，我想再谈一谈茶农的生活情况：解放前，由于茶叶生产逐步下降，茶区人民生活非常贫困，食不果腹，衣不蔽体，茅棚草屋，东倒西歪，他们描绘当时的生活，曾流传着辛酸的民谣：
    “日无鸡食米，夜无老鼠粮，衣襟当米桶，手掌当盐坛。”
    “草鞋年年长在脚，稻草蓑衣当被条。”
    可是，他们今天的生活情况怎样呢？他们除了新建房屋、添置家具、卧被，人人穿着新的衣服，生活大大改善外，还有多余的款子，储存银行。例如：祁门全县八万多人口，每年年底，全县人民储存银行的结余数字：在1951年是二万七千元，1956年是八十七万二千元，1958年是五百四十五万九千元。这说明生产逐步上升，生活随之逐步提高，回顾解放前那种“糠菜半年粮，十年一身衣”的悲惨生活，如今已是一去不复返了。因此，他们感到党是人民的救星，回忆过去痛恨反动统治的摧残，祁门茶区的人民，现在这样的歌唱着：
    “想起解放前，苦处说不完；
    百里炊烟断，茶园尽荒凉。
    产量质量都降低，祁红荣誉落千丈；
    茶区人民血泪史，越想越恨越心酸。
    自从来了共产党，祁门从此见太阳，
    祁红年年大丰收，产量质量翻几番，
    饮水不忘打井人，翻身全靠共产党。”
    解放前茶区的人民，由于生活的贫困，当然更谈不上读书识字了，所以茶农差不多都是文盲。可是现在每个地方都有成人和儿童的学校，已基本上扫除了文盲。解放前茶区人民生起病来，没有医生没有药，解放后普遍设立了诊疗所、保健站、妇产院，健康有了保障。他们又欢唱着：
    “太阳照在深山沟，贫穷疾病一起丢，
    有吃有穿有文化，更好的日子在后头。”
    从以上茶区人民的生产生活来看，谁能说，这不是一幅新旧对比极其鲜明的图画呢？
    茶农们回忆过去对比现在，生产积极性更高
    他们回想从前，真是恍如隔世，因此，他们心情舒畅，生产积极性更高，千方百计地培植茶园，改革工具，现在外销茶厂已全部机械化，公社和队都建立了初制厂，大搞技术革新和技术革命，土洋结合逐步创造和改革了许多制茶设备。同时，改进操作方法，在他们中涌现出许多快速采茶能手，如创造用双手采茶法，大大提高了采茶效率。歙县张青和姑娘，她在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，鼓足更大干劲，勤学苦练，在社队党组织的帮助下，1958年创日采鲜叶五百五十斤的纪录，1959年春茶开始，她就积极把技术传授给社员们，她自己又突破了日采千斤的大关。苏联格鲁吉亚采茶能手塔齐雅娜·特凯布恰娃写信给张青和姑娘，充满热情地表示，希望同她建立友谊。张青和姑娘给她回信中说：“我是一个普通的采茶姑娘，我在茶叶生产上，能取得一些成绩，都应归功于党”。以一个年青的农村姑娘，能有这样的高度觉悟和国际主义精神，说明了党的教育的伟大。如今她们经常愉快地在茶园里唱着山歌：
    “一片茶叶一片心，一篮茶叶一篮金，
    深情寄满绿叶里，送给恩人毛主席。”
    她们那种感激与欢乐的心情，交织在一起，多么兴奋啊！
    如上所述，我省茶叶生产和茶区人民生活的变化，是与其他方面一样，变化是极大的。总的来说，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在无比优越的社会主义制度下，在三个万岁的光荣旗帜下，任何事物，都在变化，任何角落，都在变化，都是向着繁荣幸福的道路上深刻地变化。由此，联想到我的改造问题，当前祖国的伟大形势，正是一天等于二十年的向前发展，整个社会都在跃进，而我必须适应客观形势急起直追，加紧改造自己，紧紧地跟随着时代的车轮前进。
    党教导我们，要认识社会发展的客观规律，掌握自己的命运，也就是教导我们主观要符合客观。特别是最近在我们民建、工商联两个代表大会上，党又剀切地指示我们要“顾一头，一边倒”。我们深深感到党的循循善诱、处处体现了和平改造政策的伟大和温暖。现在全国人民正在三面红旗的伟大形势下，鼓足干劲，轰轰烈烈地建设社会主义，我就应当下定决心，顾一头——一心一意顾国家利益和人民利益这一头；一边倒——倒向社会主义这一边。只有这样，才能符合客观规律，掌握自己的命运，随着全国人民一道继续前进。
    以上发言，不妥当之处，请予批评指正。
