　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd: A spring patriotic health movement of "Production emphasizes hygiene, hygiene serves production," with men and women, young and old, everyone participating, eliminating the four pests, and promoting hygiene, is being widely unfolded in the vast rural areas and cities of Hebei Province.
　　In this massive pest and disease elimination movement, the Party committees of cities, counties (districts), and commune Party committees are all led by secretaries, holding meetings, mobilizing the masses, and joining the battle with the masses. In Shijiazhuang City, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Secretary, more than five million people participated in the movement, and more than 1,290 health teams were organized to go deep into the fields to carry out publicity, medical prevention, and other work. Chengde City, in order to completely eliminate flies, proposed not to let the first generation of flies emerge from the soil, and launched a large-scale "digging pupae day" activity, mobilizing 20,000 people who eliminated 171 large fly breeding grounds in just one day. Several areas on the Bashang Plateau in Zhangjiakou City launched a vigorous rat-catching movement.
　　While vigorously eliminating the four pests, various localities, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, also adopted a method of combining the Party committees, health personnel, and the masses to resolutely fight against spring infectious diseases. Under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, Xushui County organized medical personnel and grassroots health workers to carry out five general surveys, general prevention, and general treatment movements for various diseases. The incidence of infectious diseases was greatly reduced. The incidence of infectious diseases in the first quarter decreased by 91% compared with the same period last year. There were 410 villages without infectious diseases in the county, and the attendance rate of the entire county has always remained above 90%.
　　The spring health movement closely cooperated with production. The 610,000 members of more than 80,000 fertilizer accumulation and hygiene professional teams in the province generally launched a movement to open up fertilizer sources, accumulate fertilizer, make fertilizer, and carry out harmless treatment, accumulating a large amount of high-quality fertilizer, which strongly supported the bumper harvest movement. Zhou Village, a "hygiene red flag" in Shulu County, on the basis of adhering to high-temperature fertilizer accumulation, also created the experience of harmless treatment in fermentation tanks, solving the problem of applying raw manure that had not been solved in various places for a long time. All parts of the province have generally paid attention to pig-raising hygiene, trained a large number of breeders, and formulated and promoted advanced pig-raising hygiene systems.
　　In order to further strengthen the leadership of health work and encourage the masses to work harder, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee convened a mobilization and oath-taking broadcasting conference on March 29 to vigorously carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. At the meeting, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarized the experience of advanced units in doing a good job in hygiene, and called on the Communists and the broad masses of the people in the province to have lofty ambitions and great aspirations, and to seize newer and greater achievements on the basis of the achievements already made in hygiene work, and strive for Hebei Province to become a "red flag province" in the national health work.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd: The patriotic health movement, characterized by close integration with production and vigorous development of basic hygiene construction, has been launched in the vast rural areas of Shandong.
　　As early as January this year, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated this year's plan for eliminating pests and diseases at the provincial, municipal, and county Party committee cultural and educational secretary meetings. Then, a mass sanitation blitz to vigorously develop basic sanitation construction was launched, which was carried out four times in the province, with more than 10 million people participating each time. Through continuous blitzes, not only a large amount of fertilizer has been accumulated, but also environmental sanitation has been greatly improved, and 107 advanced sanitary communes and 10,523 advanced sanitary villages have emerged one after another.
　　In each sanitation blitz movement, all localities have focused on grasping the root causes and combining them with the completion of the symptomatic treatment tasks; in the work of treating the root causes, the emphasis was on the three circles to the fields (pigs, cattle, sheep), and accumulating and making fertilizer in the fields. At the same time, vigorously carry out the five cleans (clean indoors, outdoors, streets, toilets, and kitchens) and five improvements (improve toilets, chicken coops, livestock sheds, sewage pits, and pig pens), implement unified management of feces, garbage, and sewage, establish professional fertilizer accumulation teams, and achieve daily production, daily clearing, daily sealing and harmless treatment, so that sanitation work can be organically combined with production, which not only eliminates breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, but also provides a large amount of fertilizer for production. According to incomplete statistics, as of March 25, 10,858 production teams in the province have completed the three circles to the fields, 25,129 professional fertilizer accumulation teams have been established, 22,362 production teams have implemented unified management of feces, garbage, and sewage, 143,000 sewage pits and depressions have been filled and padded, and more than 2.4 million toilets and more than 1.1 million livestock pens have been renovated and built. Through the above-mentioned improvements, 153,861,826 tons of fertilizer have been accumulated.
　　In the process of carrying out the movement, the Party committee secretaries took the lead, went deep into the base points, set an example, organized visits, and promoted them universally. In order to make the movement unfold rapidly, the Danxian County Party Committee organized a work team of 82 people and divided them into four areas to specifically supervise and inspect each commune. In order to strengthen the leadership of sanitation work, Party organizations at all levels have included sanitation work on the agenda of the Party, and specifically implemented the leadership methods of "five simultaneous" (planning, deploying, inspecting, summarizing, and evaluating sanitation work and production at the same time) and "dual management" (managing production and managing sanitation), thereby achieving double leaps in production and sanitation.
　　Due to the widespread development of the patriotic health movement, various infectious diseases have been greatly reduced, and the incidence of measles has decreased by 98.7% compared with the same period in 1959, and the incidence of influenza has decreased by 98.11%. Six counties including Anqiu and Zhucheng have not had any measles patients since last winter and this spring, and 54 basically non-epidemic communes have emerged, thereby ensuring the health of the broad masses of the people, improving labor attendance rates, and supporting the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
　　At present, the people of Shandong are advancing on this basis, taking advantage of the victory, vigorously promoting it, creating momentum, and determined to create greater achievements.
　　This newspaper reported that the patriotic health movement of vigorously promoting hygiene and eliminating diseases has taken shape throughout Guizhou Province.
　　Now the people of the whole province are actively investing in the torrent of the patriotic health movement with the heroic spirit of "poor people have high ambitions." A high tide of competitions such as counterpart competitions and ring competitions between special zones and special zones, counties and counties, communes and communes, and production teams and production teams has been rapidly launched. Counties such as Suiyang, Rongjiang, and Zhijin have put forward the bold pledge of learning from Jishan, catching up with Jishan, and surpassing Jishan. Closely integrated with production, after five days of hard work, the province has seen a new situation in which everyone is working to eliminate the four pests, every household is working on hygiene, and production and hygiene are making double leaps forward. In Guiyang City, more than 101,000 people were mobilized in five days, clearing more than 43,000 loads of garbage, sending more than 136,000 loads of fertilizer to the communes, and dredging more than 81,700 meters of ditches. Within a week, Daguan Commune in Qianxi County built more than 1,700 new toilets and renovated more than 5,550 toilets. Within three days, Santang Commune in Zhijin County saw 46 sanitary model canteens, realizing stove separation, steam disinfection of eating utensils, gauze cabinet and gauze cover, fly-proof, dust-proof, and rodent-proof equipment, cooks with work clothes, work hats, masks, cooking operations in line with hygiene, and equipped with hygiene administrators respectively.
　　At present, the people of the province are full of energy and striving for progress, taking hygiene as glory and unhygienic as shame, determined to learn from the advanced, climb to higher places, compare speed, compare level, and push the patriotic health movement to a higher stage. (Office of the Guizhou Provincial Patriotic Health Movement Committee)
　　This newspaper Chongqing, 2nd: A massive spring patriotic health movement with a vigorous focus on collective sanitation, environmental hygiene, eradicating spring plagues, and completely eliminating the remnants of the four pests has been fully launched in the mountain city of Chongqing.
　　This health movement paid special attention to strengthening the blitz work in various weak links. Some places that had not been thoroughly done in the past have been repeatedly cleaned up this time. The dredging of sewage ditches was not done enough in the past. This time, the city has formulated a repair and cleanup plan for this and thoroughly repaired it. In the urban area, in addition to clearing the breeding grounds of the four pests, the maintenance of street cleanliness and hygiene has also been particularly strengthened. For streets with a large number of passers-by, the city has adopted the method of dividing five households into a group to contract a part of the area. A group has a health supervision post, and five groups have a cleaner, so that the streets are swept when they are dirty, and pests are eliminated when they are seen, completely changing the sanitary appearance of the streets.
　　In addition to the establishment of a two-small-sweeps-a-day, one-big-sweep-every-three-days, one-blitz-a-week, three-cloths-separate-use (table cloth, dishcloth, chopping board cloth), three-proof-and-one-disinfection (fly-proof, dust-proof, anti-corrosion and disinfection) and other health systems in various street canteens throughout the city, a movement to vigorously carry out basic sanitation construction has also been launched in various canteens and nurseries, changing the ground to three-in-one soil or floor slabs, and repairing tiger stoves, separate stoves, and steam stoves, so that there is no smoke, fire, coal ash in the canteen. At the same time, the city has also universally trained cooks and childcare workers by districts. In collective dormitories or densely populated residential areas, a competition upsurge of "every household strives to be a clean household, and there are no patients in every household" is currently being launched. According to statistics from the urban area, more than 70% of the residents have been rated as "clean households."
　　The main reasons why this movement can be frequent, lasting, powerful, and effective are that the Party Committee attaches importance to it and the leaders are determined. At the beginning of the movement, from the Municipal Party Committee to the District Party Committees and County Party Committees, in-depth discussions and studies were carried out, and mobilization was carried out at all levels repeatedly. In each blitz, the secretaries and responsible comrades of various departments went to the front line to participate in the battle with the masses, or went deep into various places to inspect and direct. The Shizhong District Party Committee also transferred more than 300 full-time cadres and more than 20 section-level cadres to various command branches or streets under the district to assist in directing the battle.

    树立以卫生为光荣的风尚
    河北山东贵州和重庆掀起爱国卫生运动竞赛高潮
　　据新华社天津2日电　一个“生产讲卫生、卫生为生产”，男女老少、人人动手、大除四害、大讲卫生的春季爱国卫生运动，正在河北省广大农村和城市广泛展开。　　在这次声势浩大的除害灭病运动中，各市委、县（区）委、公社党委都是书记挂帅，召开会议，动员群众，并和群众一起投入战斗。石家庄市在市委书记领导下，五百多万人投入运动，并且组织了一千二百九十多个卫生队深入到田间，进行宣传、医疗预防等工作。承德市为彻底消灭苍蝇，提出不叫第一代苍蝇出土，开展了大规模的“挖蛹日”活动，出动两万人仅一天的时间就消灭了一百七十一处较大的苍蝇孳生地。张家口市坝上几个地区，开展了轰轰烈烈的捕鼠运动。
    在大灭四害的同时，各地在党委统一领导下还采取了党委、卫生人员、群众三结合的方法，向春季传染病进行坚决斗争。徐水县在县委统一领导下组织医务人员和群众卫生骨干，对各种疾病开展了五次普查、普防、普治运动，传染病的发病率大大降低，第一季度传染病的发病率比去年同期下降91％，全县出现了四百一十个无传染病村，全县出勤率始终保持在90％以上。
    春季卫生运动紧密地配合了生产。全省八万多个积肥卫生专业队的六十一万多名队员，普遍掀起开辟肥源，积肥、造肥、大搞无害化处理运动，积造了大量优质肥料，有力地支援了丰产运动。全省“卫生红旗”束鹿县周村，在坚持高温积肥的基础上，又创造了发酵池无害化处理经验，解决了各地长久没有解决的生粪浇稀问题。全省各地普遍注意了养猪卫生，训练了大批饲养员，制定和推行了先进的养猪卫生制度。
    中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会为进一步加强对卫生工作的领导，鼓舞群众更大的干劲，于3月29日召开了大搞除四害讲卫生运动动员誓师广播大会。会上，中共河北省委书记处书记张承先总结了先进单位搞好卫生工作的经验，并号召全省共产党员和广大人民树雄心、立大志，在卫生工作已经取得成绩的基础上夺取更新更伟大的成绩，争取河北省在全国卫生工作方面变成“红旗省”。
    据新华社济南2日电　紧密结合生产，大搞卫生基本建设为特点的爱国卫生运动，已在山东广大农村开展起来。
    早在今年1月份，中共山东省委就在全省地、市委文教书记会议上制定了今年的除害灭病计划。接着就掀起了大搞卫生基本建设的群众性卫生突击运动，在全省范围内先后搞了四次，每次都有一千多万人参加。通过连续突击，不仅积了大量肥料，而且环境卫生也大为改观，先后出现了一百零七个卫生先进公社和一万零五百二十三个卫生先进村。
    在每一次卫生突击运动中，各地都着重抓了治本工作，结合完成治标任务；在治本工作中，着重抓了三圈到田（猪、牛、羊），田间积肥造肥。同时大搞五洁（室内、室外、街道、厕所、厨房洁）五改良（改良厕所、鸡窝、牲畜棚、污水坑、猪圈），实行粪便、垃圾、污水统一管理，建立专业积肥队伍，做到日产、日清、日封和无害化处理，从而使卫生工作与生产有机地结合起来，既消灭了蚊蝇孳生地，又为生产提供了大批肥料。据不完全统计，截至3月25日止，全省三圈到田已有一万零八百五十八个生产队，建立专业积肥队伍二万五千一百二十九个，实行粪便、垃圾、污水统一管理的有二万二千三百六十二个生产队，填垫污水坑洼十四万三千多处，改良修建厕所二百四十多万个，修建牲畜栏圈一百一十多万个。通过上述改良，增积肥料一亿五千三百八十六万一千八百二十六吨。
    各地在开展运动中，党委书记挂帅，深入基点，做出样子，组织参观，普遍推广。单县为了使运动迅速展开，县委组织了八十二人的工作组，分四片到各公社具体督促检查。为加强卫生工作的领导，各级党组织把卫生工作列入到党的议事日程，具体贯彻了“五同”（把卫生工作与生产同时规划、布置、检查、总结、评比）、“双管”（管生产、管卫生）的领导方法，从而达到了生产、卫生双跃进。
    由于爱国卫生运动的广泛开展，各种传染病已大大减少，麻疹发病率比1959年同期降低了98.7％，流行性感冒降低了98.11％。安丘、诸城等六个县从去冬和今春以来没有发生麻疹病人，并出现了五十四个基本无疫公社，从而保障了广大人民身体健康，提高了劳动出勤率，支援了工农业生产持续大跃进。
    目前山东全省人民正在此基础上，乘胜前进，大张旗鼓，大造声势，决心创造更大的成绩。
    本报讯　大讲卫生、大灭疾病的爱国卫生运动，已在贵州全省形成。
    现在全省人民正以“人穷志气高”的英雄气概，积极投入爱国卫生运动的洪流。专区与专区、县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间，迅速掀起了对手赛、连环赛等竞赛高潮，绥阳、榕江、织金等县提出了学稷山、赶稷山、超稷山的豪迈誓言。各地紧密结合生产，经过五天奋战，全省出现了人人动手除四害，家家户户搞卫生和生产、卫生双跃进的新局面。贵阳市在五天中就出动了十万一千多人，清除了垃圾四万三千多担，向公社送肥十三万六千余担，疏通沟渠八万一千七百多米。黔西县大关公社一周内，新修厕所一千七百多个，改良厕所五千五百五十多个。织金县三堂公社三天内出现了四十六个卫生标兵食堂，实现了隔壁灶化，食具蒸汽消毒化，纱厨纱罩化，防蝇、防尘、防鼠设备，炊事员有工作衣、工作帽、口罩，炊事操作合乎卫生，并分别配备卫生管理员。
    目前，全省人民正鼓足干劲、力争上游，以卫生为光荣，不卫生为耻辱，决心向先进看齐，往高处攀登，比速度，比水平，把爱国卫生运动推向更高的阶段。（贵州省爱国卫生运动委员会办公室）
    本报重庆2日电　一个声势浩大的以大搞集体卫生、环境卫生、大破春瘟、彻底消灭四害残余为中心的春季爱国卫生运动，已在山城重庆全面展开。
    这次卫生运动，特别注意了加强各个薄弱环节的突击工作。一些过去搞得不够彻底的地方，这次都进行了反复清理。过去污水沟的疏浚做得不够，这次，全市对此订出了修整和清理计划，彻底地进行了修整。在城区除了清除四害孳生场所外，还特别加强了街道清洁卫生的保持工作。对过往行人多的街道在全市范围内采取五户一组分片包干的办法，一组一个卫生监督岗，五组一个清洁员，做到见脏就扫，见害就除，彻底改变了街道卫生面貌。
    全市除在各个街道食堂普遍建立了一天二小扫、三天一大扫、一周一突击，三帕分用（抹桌帕、洗碗帕、抹案板帕），三防一消（防蝇、防尘、防腐和消毒）等卫生制度外，还在各食堂、托儿所普遍掀起了大搞卫生基本建设的运动，把地面改成三合土的或楼板，大修老虎灶、隔壁灶、蒸汽灶，使食堂里不见烟火煤灰，同时，全市还分区普遍训练了炊事员、保育员。在集体宿舍或居民聚居的地方，目前正在掀起一个“家家争当清洁户、户户家中无病人”的竞赛高潮。据城区的统计，目前被评为“清洁户”的居民已经达到了70％以上。
    这次运动能够做到经常、持久、声势大、收效快的主要原因，是党委重视，领导决心大。运动一开始从市委到各区委、县委都进行了深入讨论研究，做到了层层动员，反复发动。每次突击，书记和各部门的负责同志都亲临前线和群众一道参战，或者深入各地检查、指挥。市中区区委还抽调了三百多名专职干部和二十多个科级以上干部到区属各指挥分部或各街道协助指挥作战。
