Dongshe Station Comprehensively Organizes Transportation Collaboration
Fully Exploiting the Potential of Manpower and Equipment Guaranteeing Smooth Transportation and Leaping Production

    This newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th - Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Dongshe Station, together with 59 brother units, including highways, factories, mines, people's communes, stores, and banks, have jointly created a complete set of collaborative experiences including "Eight Major Linkages," "Ten Major Sharings," and "Nine Major Unifications," organized a joint transportation operation network, and established a unified Party leadership structure. This communist collaboration fully exploits the potential of transportation equipment and loading and unloading labor, greatly shortening the time vehicles stay at the station, significantly improving transportation efficiency, and guaranteeing production needs.
    The so-called "Eight Major Linkages" are: linkage between railway and highway; linkage between railway and factory/mine; linkage between railway and people's commune; linkage between highway and factory/mine; linkage between people's commune and factory/mine; linkage between station and dispatch office; linkage between Dongshe Station and Taiyuan North Station and Yumenkou Station; linkage between the production front and the financial and trade rear. "Ten Major Sharings" are: joint use of factory and mine dedicated railway lines; joint use of locomotives; joint use of loading and unloading labor; joint use of loading and unloading machinery; joint use of communication equipment; joint use of small transportation power; joint use of self-provided vehicles; joint use of bulk cargo; joint use of warehouses; joint use of purchasing power. "Nine Major Unifications" are: unified thinking; unified command; unified indicators; unified planning; unified shifts; unified analysis of transportation tasks and the completion of various indicators; unified signals; unified competition; unified pick-up and delivery of large batches of less-than-carload freight.
    Based on the "Eight Major Linkages," "Nine Major Unifications," and "Ten Major Sharings," the CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee established the CPC Taiyuan Dongshe District Transportation Work Committee to unify the transportation business of the sixty units participating in the collaboration.
    The most important benefit of this collaboration is that it fully exploits transportation potential, guaranteeing smooth and timely transportation and meeting production needs. For example, the linkage between railway and factory/mine, and the joint use of dedicated railway lines, has opened up the original dedicated line, which only served twelve households, to forty households, thus increasing 435 freight positions, equivalent to eight times the original freight positions. After the joint use of locomotives, railway locomotives can enter the factory for operations, factory locomotives can go to the station for shunting, and the locomotives of this factory can be transferred to that factory, which not only fully utilizes the effectiveness of the locomotives, but also reduces the time vehicles stay at the station due to the change of locomotives. After the joint use of factory and mine self-provided vehicles, Jinxi Machinery Factory frequently uses the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory's trains instead of trucks to transport ore machinery, and Xiyu Coal Mine uses the Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory's vehicles to transport ash and slag, timely supporting production. After the linkage between the railway and the people's commune, the Jinsheng People's Commune organized a loading and unloading team of 300 people to help the railway, factories, and mines load, unload, and transport goods, ensuring that goods are unloaded as soon as they arrive, no matter how much there is. After unifying shifts, the transportation personnel of factories, mines, and stations are uniformly changed to three shifts, all handing over at the same time, mutually launching the "Pushing Barehead" movement, that is, before 6:00 pm every day, the entire collaboration zone must load all the cars to be loaded and unload all the cars to be unloaded, promoting the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency. Since the Dongshe District units implemented the "Eight Major Linkages," "Nine Major Unifications," and "Ten Major Sharings," the time vehicles stay at the station has been shortened from an average of 15.2 hours in the first half of 1959 to the current 13.3 hours, saving a total of 73,810 car-hours, equivalent to 3,885 wagons, transporting 155,400 tons of coal more, playing a huge role in ensuring production.
    The implementation of this collaboration can also flexibly adjust raw materials, etc., to better ensure the production leap forward of various units. In the past, some units had a backlog of coal, and some units could not get the coal they needed for a while. After the implementation of the joint use of bulk cargo, the station grasped the surplus and shortage of coal, etc., of various units, and temporarily adjusted the use with the consent of both parties, and replenished it at the end of the month. Since the beginning of this year, units such as Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, Jinxi Machinery Factory, and Taiyuan Power Plant have mutually adjusted more than 3,000 tons of coal and sand. After the production front and the financial and trade rear are linked, the financial and trade departments do everything possible to create convenient conditions for production and transportation. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, through the bank's connection, used the semi-finished products backloged by Jinxi Machinery Factory for assembly, completing the product delivery task for February ahead of schedule.

### 铁路、公路、厂矿、公社、商店、银行等部门拧成一股绳  东社车站全面组织运输协作  充分发挥了人力、设备潜力　保证了运输畅通生产跃进

    铁路、公路、厂矿、公社、商店、银行等部门拧成一股绳
    东社车站全面组织运输协作
    充分发挥了人力、设备潜力　保证了运输畅通生产跃进
    本报太原13日电　太原铁路局东社车站同公路、厂矿、人民公社、商店和银行等五十九个兄弟单位联合创造了“八大连环”、“十大共用”、“九大统一”的一整套完整的协作经验，组织了运输联动作业网，并且建立了党的统一领导机构。这种共产主义大协作，充分发挥了运输设备和装卸劳力的潜力，使车辆在站停留时间大大缩短，运输效率显著提高，保证了生产需要。
    所谓“八大连环”是：铁路与公路连环；铁路与厂矿连环；铁路与人民公社连环；公路与厂矿连环；人民公社与厂矿连环；车站与调度所连环；东社车站与太原北站、玉门沟站连环；生产前方与财贸后方连环。“十大共用”是：厂矿专用铁路线共同使用；机车共同使用；装卸劳力共同使用；装卸机械共同使用；通讯设备共同使用；小运搬力量共同使用；自备车辆共同使用；大宗货物共同使用；仓库共同使用；采购力量共同使用。“九大统一”是：统一思想；统一指挥；统一指标；统一计划；统一班次；统一分析运输任务和各项指标完成情况；统一信号；统一竞赛；统一取送大批零担货物。
    在“八大连环”、“九大统一”、“十大共用”的基础上，中共太原市委设立了中共太原市东社区运输工作委员会，统一领导参加协作的六十个单位的运输业务。
    这种协作的最主要的好处，是充分地发挥了运输潜力，保证运输畅通、及时，满足了生产需要。例如，铁路与厂矿连环，铁路专用线共同使用以后，使原来只供十二户使用的专用线开放为四十户使用，因而增加了四百三十五个货位，相当于原有货位的八倍。机车共同使用后，铁路机车可以进厂作业，厂内机车可以到车站调车，这个厂的机车可以调到那个厂去，既充分发挥了机车的效用，又减少了因调换机车而增加的车辆在站停留时间。厂矿自备车辆共同使用后，晋西机器厂经常用太原重型机器厂的火车代替汽车运输矿石机械，西峪煤矿利用氮肥厂的车辆运输灰渣，及时地支持了生产。铁路与人民公社连环以后，金胜人民公社组织了三百人的装卸队伍，帮助铁路、厂矿装卸和搬运货物，作到了货物随到随卸，来多少卸多少。统一班次后，厂矿和车站的运输人员统一改为三班，都在同一时间交接班，互相展开了“推光头”运动，即在每天下午六时以前，全协作区要把要装的车全部装上，要卸的车全部卸完，促进了装卸效率的提高。东社区各单位实行“八大连环”、“九大统一”、“十大共用”以来，车辆在站停留时间由1959年上半年的平均15.2小时，缩短到现在的13.3小时，共节省七万三千八百一十个车小时，相当于三千八百八十五辆车皮，多运了十五万五千四百多吨煤炭，对保证生产起了巨大的作用。
    实行这种协作，还能灵活地调节原材料等，更好地保证了各单位的生产跃进。过去有的单位的煤炭积压，有的单位需要的煤一时供应不上，在实行大宗货物共同使用后，车站掌握了各单位的煤炭等余缺情况，在取得双方同意的前提下，临时调剂使用，月终补齐。今年以来，太原重型机器厂、晋西机器厂和太原发电厂等单位，相互调剂了煤和砂共三千多吨。生产前方与财贸后方连环以后，财贸部门就千方百计为生产和运输创造方便条件。太原重型机器厂通过银行的联系，用晋西机器厂积压的半成品配套，提前完成了2月份的产品出厂任务。
