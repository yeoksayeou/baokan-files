    Going a Step Further from the Hundred-Foot Pole
    Xiang Yang
    During the expansion of cultivated land area last winter and this spring, farmers of all ethnic groups in Guangxi reclaimed ten million mu of virgin land. However, they did not stop at the victory, but instead, "went a step further from the hundred-foot pole" to strive for new victories: to make the barren land produce as much grain or other agricultural products as the cultivated land. In order to achieve this new task, they launched a vigorous "barren land catching up with cultivated land" campaign.
    Expanding the cultivated land area is an extremely important condition for winning a greater harvest, so we attach great importance to reclaiming barren land. More than 50 million mu of barren land have been reclaimed nationwide last winter and this spring. This provides us with new possibilities for achieving a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production. However, only when we cultivate and manage the newly reclaimed land well, and grow more grain, cotton, and other agricultural products on these lands, can we achieve the goal of increasing production. The significance of Guangxi's "barren land catching up with cultivated land" campaign lies here.
    Compared with cultivated land that has been managed for many years, newly reclaimed land has unfavorable conditions for crop production, such as the soil not being weathered and cultivated and still being relatively "raw," and the water conservancy conditions may be worse. However, it also has its advantages, especially the more than 50 million mu of land reclaimed last winter and this spring, which is not only of relatively fertile soil, but also of good reclamation quality. This largely overcomes the unfavorable factors of newly reclaimed land and increases the favorable conditions. As long as we further strengthen the care of newly reclaimed barren land like Guangxi, we can completely achieve rapid production increase. In fact, we have had many examples of high yields in the year of reclamation in the past, and there have been particularly many examples in this regard since the Great Leap Forward. Studying their experience, there is nothing mysterious, it is only because people have strengthened the management of newly reclaimed land.
    For agricultural production, spring is a decisive season. Whether newly reclaimed barren land can catch up with cultivated land also depends on whether a good foundation can be laid in the spring. As long as we, with the spirit of continuous revolution, take effective measures in light of the specific conditions of the newly reclaimed barren land, the production increase potential that has been dormant for thousands of years will surely be released more quickly, and demonstrate its power in achieving a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    百尺竿头更进一步
    向阳
    广西各族农民，在去冬今春扩大耕地面积运动中，开垦出一千万亩处女地。但是，他们并没有在胜利面前停顿下来，而是“百尺竿头更进一步”地去争取新的胜利：要荒地生产出像熟地一样多的粮食或其他农产品。为了实现这个新的任务，他们开展了轰轰烈烈的“荒地赶熟地”运动。
    扩大耕地面积，是争取更大丰收的极重要的条件，所以我们很重视开垦荒地。去冬今春全国开垦出了五千多万亩荒地。这为我们实现农业生产更大丰收，提供了新的可能。但是，只有当我们把新开垦出来的土地种好管好，在这些土地上长出更多的粮食、棉花和其他农产品的时候，我们才能实现增产的目的。广西开展“荒地赶熟地”运动的意义就在这里。
    新开垦出来的土地同经营多年的熟地比较起来，对于作物生产有它不利的条件，比如土壤没有经过风化和耕种还比较“生”，水利条件又可能差些。但是也有它有利的方面，特别是去冬今春开垦出来的这五千多万亩土地，不仅土质比较肥沃，开垦的质量也很好，这就在很大程度上克服了新垦土地的不利因素，增加了有利条件。我们只要像广西那样，进一步加强对新垦荒地的护理，是完全可以迅速增产的。事实上，过去我们已经有过许多当年开荒当年高产的例子了，大跃进以来这方面的例子尤其多。研究一下它们的经验，并没有什么神秘，只是由于人们加强了对新垦土地的管理。
    对于农业生产，春天是个决定性的季节。新垦荒地能不能赶上熟地，关键也在春季能不能打好基础。只要我们以不断革命的精神，针对新垦荒地的具体情况，采取有效措施，那沉眠了千百年的增产潜力，定会更快的发挥出来，在实现今年农业生产更好更全面的继续跃进中，显示出自己的威力。
