    Proud Pearl
    Ni Minyu

    The Blue Danube is the most outstanding beauty in Europe, and Budapest is a dazzling pearl on this beauty's crown.

    All Hungarians are proud of their capital. Everyone praises this magnificent city built by the simple people through generations, sings of its glorious history of struggle, and even more praises its happy and beautiful present. Today, the boiling new life makes this pearl of the Danube radiate dazzling light day and night.

    The Danube River flows slowly from northwest to southeast, dividing Budapest into two banks, east and west. The west bank of the river is Buda, and the east bank is Pest. Eight large bridges closely connect these two sisters—Buda and Pest.

    Budapest is a beautiful city, but also a city full of the epic of the people's heroic struggle. On March 15, 1848, a revolution of the Hungarian people against the tyranny of the Habsburg dynasty broke out in Pest. It was also at this time that the poet Petőfi wrote his immortal poems, and the revolutionary leader Kossuth called on the people to rise up and fight for independence and freedom. In 1919, the Hungarian working class raised the red flag of revolution here and established the Hungarian Soviet Republic. During the one hundred and thirty-three days of the Soviet Republic's existence, a series of unprecedented great reforms were realized, which made the rulers of the world tremble with fear!

    World War II brought great losses to Budapest. 74% of the city's buildings were partially or completely destroyed. Before fleeing, the German fascists also blew up all the bridges on the Danube.

    The storms of history have ravaged this pearl on the Danube countless times, but liberation finally brought new life to Budapest. In the spring of 1945, a new period began in the history of Budapest. After suffering severe war damage, it was thought that the city's reconstruction would take at least decades. However, thanks to the efforts of the liberated Hungarian people and the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, a brand-new city reappeared on the banks of the Danube in just a few years.

    In order to commemorate the Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Budapest, the Hungarian people built a huge Soviet Army Martyrs' Memorial on Gellért Hill on the banks of the Danube. Flowers bloom year-round beneath this bronze statue of a Soviet soldier, several feet high. On top of the monument stands the solemn and simple statue of the "Goddess of Peace." It seems to be warning all enemies at home and abroad: Any conspiracy to obstruct the Hungarian people's advance on the road of socialism is bound to meet with a shameful defeat! The facts have powerfully proved this: The bandits who launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956 were crushed to pieces.

    Budapest is not only the political center of the country, but also the economic center of the country. One-fifth of the country's population (1,807,000 people) is concentrated here. Budapest's industrial products account for more than one-half of the country's total industrial output value. After liberation, many new enterprises were built here, existing factories were expanded, and many new industrial zones such as Csepel and New Pest were opened up. The country's largest iron and steel complex, machinery manufacturing plant and textile mill are all located here. The capital's workers are very motivated. After the Party Central Committee issued a call to accelerate socialist construction in 1959, factories in Budapest took the lead in launching a labor competition to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. They did what they said they would do, and most factories and enterprises overfulfilled their proposed production increase and savings plans, winning a beautiful battle on the production front. At the beginning of the new year, a labor competition to welcome the 15th anniversary of the country's liberation has been launched vigorously throughout the city, and production indicators have been rising sharply.

    The face of Budapest is changing with each passing day, and becoming more and more beautiful! High-rise buildings have been built in the former 13th district—a slum area. New residences, shops, schools, cultural palaces, etc. stand in neat rows. No one would have imagined that before liberation, this was a collection of slums and small shacks. In the suburbs of the city, even tap water was unavailable before liberation, but today wide asphalt roads have replaced the narrow, dusty streets of the past. Electric trains can quickly take people to their offices or factories to work.

    The residents of the capital love their city. Social voluntary labor is often organized to build and beautify the capital of the motherland. In the past year alone, the city's residents completed social labor worth 25 million forints (Hungarian currency). In the workers' districts of New Pest and Angel Ground, residents have used voluntary labor to build many cultural palaces, nurseries, canteens and other public buildings. This year, the city's residents are expected to complete social labor worth more than 30 million forints. The city's greening work will also be fully completed within one year.

    The residents of Budapest are not only concerned about the construction and life of the capital, they are also watching the development of socialist construction throughout the country every day. When the Party Central Committee put forward the call to accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture in 1959, the vast number of workers, staff members and cultural workers in Budapest enthusiastically responded to this call and actively supported the collectivization movement in the countryside. Many workers rushed to the countryside to help with propaganda and organization work, and used their holidays to help cooperatives build livestock sheds, etc. Each factory and enterprise is also fixed to be responsible for regularly helping a newly established cooperative solve various difficult problems. Many cadres and technicians also responded to the Party's call and transferred to agricultural cooperatives for long-term work. Actors often go to rural areas and mining areas to perform for the workers. The masses all over the country are also listening to the beating of the motherland's heart with pride!

    骄傲的明珠
    倪敏玉
    蓝色多瑙河是欧洲最出色的美人，而布达佩斯则是这美人发冠上一颗灿烂夺目的明珠。
    所有的匈牙利人都为自己的首都而骄傲。大家称赞朴实的人民世世代代所建造起来的这座雄伟壮丽的城市，歌颂它光辉的斗争历史，更赞美它幸福美好的今天。如今沸腾的新生活使这多瑙河的明珠日夜放射着耀眼的光芒。
    多瑙河水缓缓地从西北流向东南，把布达佩斯分成东西两岸。河西岸是布达，东岸是佩斯。八座大桥紧紧地把这两姊妹——布达和佩斯连在一起。
    布达佩斯是美丽的城市，同时也是充满着人民英勇斗争的史诗的城市。1848年3月15日在佩斯爆发了匈牙利人民反抗哈布斯堡王朝暴政的革命，也就是在这个时候，诗人裴多菲写下了他的不朽的诗篇，革命领袖科苏特号召人民起来为独立和自由而战。1919年匈牙利工人阶级曾在这里举起了革命的红旗，建立了匈牙利苏维埃共和国。在苏维埃共和国存在的一百三十三天的过程中，实现了一系列史无前例的伟大改革，使世界上的统治者胆战心惊！
    第二次世界大战给布达佩斯带来了重大损失，全市74％的建筑物部分或全部地被摧毁。德国法西斯在溃逃之前并炸毁了多瑙河上的全部桥梁。
    历史的风暴曾无数次摧残了这多瑙河上的明珠，但解放终于给布达佩斯带来了新生。1945年春天在布达佩斯的历史上开始了一个新的时期。在遭受战争严重的破坏之后，人们认为城市的重建至少要花几十年的功夫。但是，由于解放了的匈牙利人民的努力和苏联的大力帮助，在短短几年内，一个崭新的城市又出现在多瑙河畔。
    为了纪念为解放布达佩斯而牺牲的苏军战士，匈牙利人民在多瑙河岸边的盖莱特山上修建了巨大的苏军烈士纪念碑，在这高达数丈的苏军战士的青铜巨像下，鲜花常年不断。在纪念碑的顶上，耸立着庄严朴素的“和平女神”的雕像。它好像在警告国内外一切敌人：任何企图阻挠匈牙利人民在社会主义大路上挺进的阴谋，都必然要遭到可耻的失败！事实有力地证明了这一点：1956年10月制造反革命叛乱的匪徒们就被击得粉碎。
    布达佩斯不仅是全国的政治中心，而且是全国的经济中心，全国五分之一的人口（一百八十万七千人）集中在这里。布达佩斯的工业产品占全国工业总产值的二分之一多。解放后在这里建筑了很多新企业，扩建了旧有工厂，开辟了像切佩尔、新佩斯等很多新的工业区。全国最大的钢铁联合企业、机器制造厂和纺织厂等都在这里。首都的职工们干劲非常足，1959年党中央发出加速社会主义建设的号召后，布达佩斯各工厂首先掀起了提前一年完成三年计划主要指标的劳动竞赛。他们说到就做到，大部分工厂企业都超额完成了它们提出的增产节约计划，在生产战线上打了一次漂亮仗。新春伊始，迎接祖国解放十五周年的劳动竞赛，就又在全市轰轰烈烈地展开，生产指标直线上升。
    布达佩斯的面貌在日新月异地变化着，而且变得一天比一天更美好！在从前的十三区——贫民区，已建起了高楼大厦。新住宅、商店、学校、文化宫等整齐林立，谁也想不到解放前这里曾是一个个的贫民窑和小草棚。城市郊区在解放前连自来水也喝不到，而今天宽阔的沥青马路已代替了过去的布满尘土的狭窄街道。电气火车很快就可把人们送到各机关或工厂去上班。
    首都居民都热爱自己的城市。经常组织社会义务劳动来建设和美化祖国的首都。去年一年内全市居民就完成了价值二千五百万福林（匈币）的社会劳动。在新佩斯和安琪尔地等工人区，居民用义务劳动兴建了很多文化宫、托儿所和食堂等公共建筑。今年全市居民预计将完成价值超过三千万福林的社会劳动。全市的绿化工作也将于一年内全部完成。
    布达佩斯的居民不仅只是关心首都的建设和生活，他们每天都在注视着全国各地社会主义建设事业的发展。当1959年党中央提出加速农业社会主义改造的号召后，布达佩斯的广大职工、机关工作人员和文化工作者，都热烈响应了这一号召，积极支持了农村的合作化运动。很多职工赶到农村去帮助作宣传组织工作，利用假日帮助合作社建筑畜舍等。各工厂企业并固定负责经常帮助一个新成立的合作社解决各种困难问题。很多干部和技术人员也响应党的号召，纷纷转到农业合作社去长期工作，演员们也常到农村和矿区去为劳动者演出。全国各地的群众也都怀着骄傲的心情，关切地倾听着祖国心脏的跳动！
