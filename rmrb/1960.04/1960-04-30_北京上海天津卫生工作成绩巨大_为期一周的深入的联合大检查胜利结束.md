    Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin Achieve Great Success in Hygiene Work
    In-Depth Joint Inspection Lasting One Week Ends Successfully

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin's joint hygiene inspection concluded successfully on the 26th. This week-long in-depth inspection reviewed the achievements of the three cities' patriotic health campaigns, exchanged work experiences, and promoted the further development of the campaigns.

    The inspection team believes that, due to the rapid and in-depth development of the patriotic health campaigns in the three cities, significant achievements have been made in a short period. This is because, based on the achievements of the hygiene campaigns in the past few years, the Party organizations at all levels in the three cities have further strengthened their leadership, worked meticulously, and implemented concrete measures. The inspection team believes that the sound organization of hygiene institutions in the leading departments at all levels in the three cities, and the spirited medical personnel playing a key role, have also played a certain guarantee in the development of the campaign.

    The inspection team put forward further improvement suggestions for some units where hygiene work was not done well enough, which greatly promoted hygiene work.

    After the inspection, the three cities held summary symposiums respectively, listening to the inspection team's report on the situation of the hygiene work inspection. The three cities will, based on the inspection team's opinions, continue to exert full effort, create momentum, and carry out the patriotic health campaign more deeply.
