Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Most parts of the country have experienced low temperatures and little rain in the first ten days of April. Recently, most areas of the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River basins have received rain or snow. Drought resistance and emergency planting work are still being intensified in various regions.

In the first ten days of April, there was no rain in Inner Mongolia, western Northeast, central and northern Hebei Province for the entire ten days. Rainfall in the vast areas of the Yellow River basin was less than half of the normal amount for the same period in previous years. The drought situation is still continuing in parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Gansu, Shaanxi, and northern Henan provinces. There was also no rain in Yunnan, Guangxi, and areas near the Nanling Mountains in the first ten days of April.

Since April 10th, most areas of the Yellow River basin have received rain or snow successively, and most areas of the Yangtze River basin and the Huai River basin have received rain. Except for parts of eastern Gansu, central Shanxi, western Shandong, northern Shaanxi, and eastern Ningxia, where precipitation was between ten and twenty millimeters, rainfall (snowfall) in other northern regions was relatively small. Rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the south was greater.

This spring, relatively severe spring droughts occurred in the Yellow River basin and Guangdong, Fujian, and other places. Since mid-to-late March, rain (snow) has fallen in various regions, and the drought situation has eased somewhat in most areas. However, most areas of the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Gansu, and parts of Shaanxi and Henan have consistently experienced little rain. In addition, parts of Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces and regions, as well as western Northeast China, are also experiencing drought. Currently, drought-stricken areas are continuing to vigorously combat drought, planting, and irrigating wheat against drought. Shandong and Hebei have each mobilized more than ten million laborers for drought resistance. After this rainfall, various regions are making a concentrated effort to rush planting.

    各地抗旱抢种抗旱浇麦加紧进行
    新华社14日讯　全国大部地区4月上旬低温少雨，最近黄河、淮河、长江流域大部地区才下了雨或雪。各地抗旱抢种工作仍在加紧进行。
    4月上旬，内蒙古、东北西部、河北省中部和北部全旬无雨，黄河流域广大地区雨量不及常年同期的一半，河北、山西、山东、甘肃、陕西部分地区和河南省北部地区的旱象还在持续；云南、广西和南岭附近地区，4月上旬也没有下雨。
    4月10日以来，黄河流域绝大部分地区先后下了雨或雪，长江流域大部地区和淮河流域等地下了雨。北方除甘肃东部、山西中部、山东西部、陕西北部、宁夏东部的部分地区降水量在十毫米到二十毫米之间外，其它地区雨（雪）量较小。南方长江中下游地区雨量较大。
    今春黄河流域和广东、福建等地曾发生较重的春旱。自3月中下旬以来，各地陆续下雨（雪），大部地区旱象有所缓和。但是北方的河北、山东、山西、甘肃四省的大部地区和陕西、河南部分地区一直少雨。此外，内蒙古、贵州、云南等省区的部分地区和东北西部地区也有旱象。现在，受旱的地区都在继续大力抗旱，抗旱播种，抗旱浇麦。山东、河北投入抗旱的劳力各在一千万人以上。这次雨后，各地都在突击抢种。
