Chengdu, April 5th (This newspaper) – A production competition upsurge with the red banner counties of Lezhi and Wusheng as pacesetters is sweeping across Sichuan Province, forming a great situation of catching up and surpassing each other and ten thousand horses galloping ahead on the agricultural production front throughout the province.

The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the experiences of Lezhi and Wusheng counties, using these two counties as pacesetters to promote the continued leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province. The Provincial Committee has successively held on-site meetings in these two counties, and also organized an unprecedented province-wide visitation activity. More than 50,000 people from more than 100 counties throughout the province have visited these two counties. At the recent Provincial Party Congress, it was again called upon farmers throughout the province to learn from Lezhi and Wusheng counties.

“One heart, one mind, one way” is one of the most important experiences of these two advanced counties in developing agricultural production. People in various places have been greatly inspired during their visits and studies, liberating their thinking and adding to their enthusiasm. After cadres in Xinfan County visited Lezhi and Wusheng, they mobilized the masses to discuss the matter in light of local conditions. Everyone agreed that “what others can do under poorer conditions, we should do even better under better conditions.” Communes and production teams have successively formulated plans and added measures, determined to unify their thinking, unify their actions, and go all out to catch up with Lezhi and Wusheng. Suining County, which is adjacent to Lezhi, sent cadres and farmer representatives to Lezhi and Wusheng counties to study and visit. From the county and district levels to the communes and production teams, they quickly established more than 3,000 red banner mountains, red banner bays, and red banner dams to compete with Lezhi and Wusheng, and focused on 160,000 mu of red banner fields to promote all-round development and carry out the field management movement of "big fertilizer, big water, big soil cultivation," which increased the proportion of first-class wheat seedlings in the county from 45% to 61%, while the proportion of third-class seedlings decreased from 15% to 7%. Many areas with poorer natural conditions have been greatly encouraged after visiting and learning, and have become more determined to transform backwardness into advancement.

After studying the experiences of Lezhi and Wusheng in various places, a large number of cadres with firm standpoints, advanced thinking, full enthusiasm, and in-depth work styles were selected to strengthen the leadership of communes, management areas, and production teams, and to establish strong leading cores at all levels. In Zhongjiang County, 6% of the communes and a few management areas used to be backward in their work. The county party committee selected a group of party member backbones from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to participate in leadership work. These backbones closely relied on the masses and resolutely implemented the party's various policies. In just over two months, the production outlook was completely renewed, and half of the originally backward communes and management areas caught up with the advanced, and the rest also caught up with the middle level. Many places have also paid attention to implementing the class line in various tasks based on the experiences of these two counties. In the rural canteens of Nanchong Prefecture, 87% of the managers and cooks were poor and lower-middle peasants, so the canteens were run very well, and less than 5% of the canteens were third-class. After visiting and studying Lezhi and Wusheng, the work style of the broad masses of cadres in various places has become more in-depth and pragmatic. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the broad masses of cadres to go deep among the masses, participate in production, and lead production. Various places have responded actively, and a large number of cadres have poured into the front line of production. According to statistics from Yibin, Neijiang, and Nanchong prefectures alone, more than 35,000 cadres have arrived at the front line of production.

After visiting and studying Lezhi and Wusheng in various places, a competition upsurge was immediately launched. Suining, Jianyang, Anyue, Ziyang, and other counties neighboring Lezhi County have launched head-to-head competitions with Lezhi between counties and counties, districts and districts, and communes and communes. Dozens of counties throughout the province have issued challenge letters and are conducting friendly competitions with Lezhi and Wusheng, chasing each other, and the heat wave is surging, and the work of spring management and spring production is changing with each passing day. Based on the experience of Lezhi and Wusheng in meticulously managing wheat fields, all parts of the province have been tightly grasping the later-stage management of wheat fields, applying sufficient fertilizer and water, attacking ears and grains, thoroughly controlling insects, and cultivating soil to prevent lodging. Now, more than 50 million mu of spring crops throughout the province are blooming and bearing fruit and growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Huidong County, where the season is earlier, has already reported the good news of a bumper wheat harvest. More than 10 million mu of early corn have been sown throughout the province, and generally, deep plowing of more than one foot is carried out, and 20,000 to 30,000 jin of basal fertilizer is applied per mu, and directional close planting is adopted. 5.4 billion jin of sweet potato seedlings have been cultivated, and 3 million mu of early rice seedlings have been cultivated, and the seedlings are strong and green, and 250,000 mu have been transplanted, and the rest are being transplanted one after another. Cotton seedlings are generally cultivated in warm beds with fire in various places, and 970,000 mu have been cultivated, and another 670,000 mu have been directly sown, one solar term earlier than in previous years.

Chengdu, April 5th (This newspaper) – In the continuous leap forward in agriculture in Sichuan Province, two distinct red flags have been erected – Lezhi County and Wusheng County. The emergence of these two advanced counties in production and advanced counties in work has greatly encouraged the people of the whole province, provided many valuable experiences, and played a significant role in promoting various productions and work.

Lezhi and Wusheng counties are both located in hilly areas with barren land and poor natural conditions. In the past, the level of agricultural production was very low. However, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they have both jumped to the forefront of the province with excellent results. In Lezhi County, the total grain output increased by more than 50% annually in 1958 and 1959, changing from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area. In Wusheng County, the total grain output increased by 53.2% in 1958 compared to 1957. In 1959, it suffered from a severe drought unprecedented in decades, but the grain output still increased by 20.6% compared to the previous year.

This year, the spring and summer production of these two counties is even more outstanding. In Lezhi County, 200,000 mu of wheat have basically achieved the transformation of first-class seedlings, with an average of 350,000 to 450,000 ears per mu of general fields, and even more ears in 60,000 mu of high-yield fields. For summer crops, 80,000 mu of early and mid-season rice seedling fields have been sown one solar term earlier, achieving uniform specifications and quality, all of which are strong seedlings. The average amount of fertilizer per mu of summer crops is 50,000 jin, and the amount of fertilizer in high-yield fields is 60,000 to 70,000 jin. Rice paddies are generally plowed one more time and harrowed twice more than last year. The spring crop growth in Wusheng County is as good as that in Lezhi County, and it is even more prominent in terms of multi-cropping and multi-harvesting. The sown area of spring crops in the county has increased by 19.3% compared to last year, and the increase in planting on non-arable land has doubled compared to last year. In terms of summer crops, the county has increased the planting of early corn by more than 60,000 mu, an increase of four times compared to last year, and the sowing quality is also high. The early cornfields have been deeply turned and deeply plowed twice last winter and this spring, and 30,000 jin of basal fertilizer has been applied per mu. The county plans to transplant 120,000 mu of early rice, an increase of five times compared to last year. All the paddy fields were pressed down with green manure last year, and 20,000 jin of basal fertilizer has been applied per mu.

These two counties have also done a great job in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries, and technical innovation and mass life arrangements. Wusheng County has developed pigs to 0.72 heads per mu. The county has carried out large-scale tool reforms in deep plowing and land preparation, water lifting and irrigation, water conservancy construction, transportation, agricultural and sideline product processing, pig raising, canteens, field management, harvesting, and threshing, saving more than 144,000 labor days in one year. Lezhi County has manufactured 275 various lathes, 6,000 large tools such as vise pliers, thread cutting boards, hacksaws, and steel files, and has established 69 agricultural tool factories and 440 agricultural tool repair stations, forming an agricultural tool repair network. In terms of canteens, 4,356 canteens in Wusheng County have basically achieved red flag canteenization, with hot dishes and fragrant meals at every meal, ensuring that members eat their fill, eat well, and eat cleanly and hygienically. In Lezhi County's 4,654 canteens, the well-run first- and second-class canteens account for 96.3% of the total number of canteens. The living standards of 81% of the farmers in the county have improved compared to before participating in the canteen.

The high-speed development of agricultural production in Lezhi County and Wusheng County is a victory for the general line, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a victory for the people's commune. At the same time, it is also the result of the hard work of the people of the whole county with one heart, one mind, and one way under the leadership of the Party. Their common experience once again proves that political and ideological work is the soul of all work. As long as the leadership of the Party is strengthened, victory can be achieved in everything. The higher the leadership level, the higher the production level. Lezhi County and Wusheng County used to be very poor, and their production conditions were also poor. Lezhi County has long had this saying: "Anyue (County) fields, Suining (County) soil, Lezhi is all stony bones." People believe that Lezhi has poor soil quality and that grain output cannot be high. A wheat yield of 200 jin per mu would be very good. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, party committees at all levels have launched a massive propaganda and education campaign on the general line, and have specifically established more than 100 high-yield experimental fields in some areas with poor soil quality, thereby opening the eyes of the masses, and everyone has established lofty ambitions. After a year of hard work, in 1959, the average yield of 170,000 mu of wheat in the county reached 501 jin, creating a new record of high yield over large areas in the province. This year, the wheat yield increase plan formulated by this county has greatly exceeded last year. When Wusheng County was formulating this year's production increase plan, it carried out large-scale airing of views, debates, and contention in the whole county, greatly boosting revolutionary enthusiasm. The broad masses showed a fearless heroic spirit – if the land is poor, improve it; if the land is thin, thicken it. The whole county has transformed more than 80,000 mu of land, making the crops on the slopes and plains grow in the same way.

Lezhi and Wusheng counties both pay great attention to establishing strong leading cores. This is the organizational guarantee for realizing the Great Leap Forward. Lezhi County insists on using advanced elements with firm standpoints, advanced thinking, full enthusiasm, great impartiality, and in-depth work styles as the leading backbone. Since the Great Leap Forward, the county has cultivated and selected a large number of activists from poor and lower-middle peasants to strengthen the leadership positions at the county, district, commune, and team levels, and has established the absolute leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas. Wusheng County transferred a group of party member cadres at the level of section chiefs and bureau chiefs and some district party committee secretaries from county-level organs to people's communes to serve as party committee secretaries, so that all 34 communes in the county had strong commanders. At the same time, they also resolutely implemented the Party's class line and rectified the grassroots organizations. Now, 87% of the grassroots cadres above the level of production team leader in the county are activists from poor and lower-middle peasants. After establishing a strong and powerful leading core at all levels, the unity of the whole Party was guaranteed, and the Party's various policies were fully and deeply implemented.

The simple and hard-working work style of the cadres, their in-depth and down-to-earth approach, and their close ties with the masses are the common characteristics of these two counties, and they are also an important factor for their sustained leap forward. More than 800 cadres at the county, district, and commune levels in Lezhi County were transferred to lower levels with their positions, ate, lived, and labored with the masses, participated in production, and led production. All cadres have achieved "five brings" and "five diligences." The "five brings" are: bring tools, bring loudspeakers, bring big-character posters, bring good news, bring rulers; the "five diligences" are: be diligent in speaking, diligent in working, diligent in thinking, diligent in observing, and diligent in moving about. The cadres and the masses are truly integrated and as close as a family. Grassroots cadres in Wusheng County grasp production with one hand and grasp life with the other. In addition to participating in agricultural production, they also regularly participate in cooking work in canteens and feeding work in pig farms, achieving multi-skills in one person, being both commanders and production workers, cooks, and feeders. Cadres at all levels in the county have established more than 20,000 mu of experimental fields for various crops, 453 experimental fields for canteens, and a large number of experimental pig farms. Cadres always walk in front of the masses, and the broad masses warmly support the cadres. The relationship between cadres and the masses is as close as fish and water. Wherever the cadres lead, the masses fight.

    一马当先　万马奔腾　全面跃进浪潮高
    四川各县猛追乐至和武胜
    学习他们上下一心，艰苦奋战，改变落后局面，跨上先进前列的好样子
    本报成都5日电　四川省各地掀起以红旗县乐至、武胜为标兵的生产竞赛高潮，在全省农业生产战线上形成你追我赶、万马奔腾的大好局面。
    中共四川省委非常重视乐至、武胜两县的经验，以这两县为标兵，推动全省农业生产继续跃进。省委先后在这两个县召开了现场会，同时还组织了空前规模的全省性参观活动。全省先后有一百多个县的五万多人到这两个县参观访问。最近举行的全省党代会上，又号召全省农民向乐至和武胜两县看齐。
    “一条心、一股劲、一个样”，是这两个先进县在发展农业生产中最重要的经验之一。各地人民在参观学习中，得到了很大启发，解放了思想，增添了干劲。新繁县干部参观乐至、武胜以后，结合本地情况发动群众讨论，大家一致认为，“别人条件差能做到的，我们条件好的地方应当做得更好”，各公社、生产队纷纷订计划、添措施，决定统一思想，统一行动，鼓足干劲，直追乐至和武胜。与乐至紧邻的遂宁县派干部和农民代表到乐至、武胜两县学习参观后，从县、区到公社、生产队，迅速建立赛乐至赛武胜的红旗山、红旗湾、红旗坝三千多处，并以十六万亩红旗田为重点，推动全面，开展“大肥、大水、大培土”的田间管理运动，使全县小麦一类苗由原来45％上升到61％，三类苗则由15％下降到7％。许多自然条件较差的地区，经过参观学习，受到很大鼓舞，更加坚定了变落后为先进的信心。
    各地学习乐至、武胜的经验之后，选拔了大批立场坚定、思想先进、干劲十足、作风深入的干部，充实公社、管理区和生产队的领导，层层树立起坚强的领导核心。中江县原来有6％的公社和少数管理区工作落后，县委便选拔了一批贫农和下中农出身的党员骨干，参加领导工作；这些骨干紧紧依靠群众，坚决贯彻党的各种方针政策，仅两个多月时间便使生产面貌焕然一新，有半数原来落后的社和管理区赶上了先进，其余也都赶上了中等水平。许多地方还根据这两个县的经验，在各项工作中注意贯彻阶级路线。南充专区各县农村食堂中，占87％的事务长、炊事员都是贫民和下中农，因而食堂办得很好，三类食堂不到5％。在参观学习乐至、武胜以后，各地广大干部作风更加深入、踏实。最近，中共四川省委号召广大干部深入群众，参加生产领导生产，各地积极响应，大量干部涌向生产第一线。仅宜宾、内江、南充三个专区统计，就有三万五千多名干部到达生产第一线。
    各地参观学习乐至、武胜之后，立即掀起竞赛热潮。和乐至县邻近的遂宁、简阳、安岳、资阳等县，都和乐至展开县与县、区与区、社与社对手赛。全省有数十个县发出挑战书，和乐至、武胜进行友谊竞赛，你追我赶，热浪滔滔，小春管理和大春生产工作日新月异。全省各地根据乐至和武胜精细管理麦田的经验，紧抓麦田后期管理，饱施肥水，攻穗攻粒，彻底治虫，培土防倒。现在全省五千多万亩小春作物正开花结实，生长良好，丰收在望。季节较早的会东县，已传出小麦丰收的捷报。全省已播种早玉米一千多万亩，一般都做到深耕一尺以上，每亩施底肥二至三万斤，采取定向密植。红苕已育苗五十四亿斤，早稻育秧三百万亩，秧苗健壮青绿，已栽插二十五万亩，其余正陆续栽插。各地普遍采用火温床育棉苗，已育成九十七万亩，另外直播六十七万亩，比往年提早一个节气。
    本报成都5日电　四川省在农业继续大跃进中，树立起了两面鲜明的红旗——乐至县和武胜县。这两个生产先进、工作先进县的出现，给全省人民极大的鼓舞，提供了许多宝贵的经验，对推动各项生产和工作起了重大作用。
    乐至和武胜两县，都处于丘陵地区，土地贫瘠，自然条件不好，过去农业生产水平很低。但是，从1958年大跃进以来，他们都以优异的成绩跨到全省的最前列。乐至县在1958年和1959年两年内，粮食总产量每年递增50％以上，由缺粮区变为余粮区；武胜县粮食总产量1958年比1957年增加53.2％，1959年遭受了数十年未有的严重旱灾，粮食产量仍比上年增产20.6％。
    今年，这两个县的小春和大春生产更加突出。乐至县二十万亩小麦基本实现一类苗化，一般田每亩有三十五万穗到四十五万穗；六万亩高产田的穗数更多。大春作物，八万亩早、中稻秧田，已提前一个节气播种完毕，做到规格质量一个样，全是壮秧。平均每亩大春作物有肥料五万斤，高产田有肥料六万斤到七万斤。水稻田一般都比去年多犁一道、多耙两次。武胜县的小春作物生长情况和乐至县同样好，在多种多收方面更是突出。全县小春作物播种面积比去年扩大19.3％，利用非耕地增种比去年增加两倍。在大春作物方面，全县已增种早玉米六万多亩，比去年扩大四倍，播种质量也高。早玉米地，去冬今春先后两次深翻、深耕，每亩施底肥三万斤。全县计划插早稻十二万亩，比去年扩大五倍。全部水田去年已压下青肥，每亩已施底肥两万斤。
    这两个县在林、牧、副业以及技术革新和群众生活安排等方面也做得很出色。武胜县生猪发展到每亩地已达0.72头。全县在深耕整地、提水灌溉、水利施工、交通运输、农副产品加工、养猪、食堂、田间管理、收割脱粒等方面大搞工具改革，一年已节省劳动日十四万四千多个。乐至县自制各种车床二百七十五台，老虎钳、套丝板、钢锯、钢锉等大件工具六千件，办起了六十九个农具厂、四百四十个农具修配站，建成了农具修配网。在食堂方面，武胜县四千三百五十六个食堂，基本实现红旗食堂化，顿顿饭热菜香，保证社员吃饱吃好吃得干净卫生。乐至县四千六百五十四个食堂中，办得好的一、二类食堂占食堂总数的96.3％。全县81％的农户生活水平比参加食堂前提高。
    乐至县和武胜县农业生产高速度发展，是总路线的胜利、大跃进的胜利、人民公社的胜利。同时也是全县人民在党的领导下一条心、一股劲、一个样艰苦奋斗的结果。他们共同的经验再一次证明，政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂。只要加强党的领导，就能无往不胜。领导水平高，生产水平也高。乐至县和武胜县过去都很穷，生产条件也差。乐至县长久以来流传着这种说法：“安岳（县）田、遂宁（县）土，乐至尽是石骨骨”。人们认为乐至土质差，粮食产量不可能高，小麦亩产二百斤就很不错了。1958年大跃进以来，各级党委展开了规模浩大的总路线宣传教育活动，并特地在一些土质差的地区建立了一百多处高产试验田，从而打开了群众的眼界，人人树立了雄心大志，经过一年苦战，1959年全县十七万亩小麦平均亩产达到五百零一斤，创造了全省大面积高产的新纪录。今年这个县制定的小麦增产计划，又大大超过去年。武胜县在制定今年增产计划时，在全县开展大鸣大放大争大辩，大鼓革命干劲，广大群众表现了大无畏的英雄气概——土地差，把它改好，土地薄，把它加厚，全县改造了八万多亩土地，使坡上、平坝庄稼长得一个样。
    乐至和武胜县都十分注意树立坚强的领导核心。这是实现大跃进的组织保证。乐至县坚持以立场坚定、思想先进、干劲十足、大公无私、作风深入的先进分子作领导骨干，从大跃进以来，全县已培养和选拔了大批贫农和下中农中的积极分子，充实县、区、社、队各级领导岗位，在农村中树立了贫农和下中农的绝对领导优势。武胜县从县级机关中抽调了一批科局长一级党员干部及部分区委书记，下放到人民公社担任党委书记，使全县三十四个公社，社社都有坚强的指挥官。同时，他们还坚决贯彻党的阶级路线，对基层组织也进行了整顿。现在全县各生产队长以上的基层干部中87％都是出身于贫农和下中农的积极分子。层层树立起坚强有力的领导核心后，保证了全党团结一致，使党的各项方针政策得到全面深入的贯彻。
    干部作风艰苦朴素、深入踏实，密切联系群众，是这两个县的共同特色，也是他们能以持续跃进的重要因素。乐至县县、区、社各级干部八百多人，带职层层下放，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，参加生产，领导生产。所有干部都作到“五带”、“五勤”。“五带”是：带工具、带广播筒、带大字报、带喜报、带尺子；“五勤”是：口勤、手勤、脑勤、眼勤、腿勤。干部和群众真正打成一片，亲如一家人。武胜县农村基层干部一手抓生产，一手抓生活，除参加农业生产外，还定期到食堂参加炊事工作，到养猪场参加饲养工作，做到了一人多能，既是指挥员，又是生产员、炊事员、饲养员。全县各级干部共建立了各种农作物试验田两万多亩、食堂试验田四百五十三个和大量养猪试验田。干部事事走在群众前面，广大群众对干部热诚拥护，干群关系水乳交融，干部领导到哪里，群众战斗到那里。
