Comrade Chairman, Fellow Deputies:
I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan ZhenLin.

In the past year, the people of our country, closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, opposed Right deviation, boosted morale, eliminated various difficulties in the course of advancement, swept away the small gust of sinister wind stirred up by certain Right opportunists, and achieved the great victory of the second year of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. This victory shows us that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will surely be able to achieve a better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward in 1960 and throughout the entire 1960s.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1959, the youth of all fronts in our country actively responded to the call of the Party, demonstrating vigorous spirit and high morale. When the Party proposed launching a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy, complete and overfulfill the annual plan, and achieve the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the broad masses of young workers immediately launched a powerful movement to "Enter 1960 at High Speed." Three million eight hundred thousand young workers and ten thousand youth collectives across the country completed the entire year's workload one month ahead of schedule, followed by another five million young workers and one hundred thousand youth collectives, entering 1960 half a month ahead of schedule. After this battle, the broad masses of young workers continued their efforts, advancing victoriously, and together with all workers, launched a vigorous and enthusiastic "Red Start" competition for 1960, overfulfilling the production tasks for the first quarter of this year and creating a good start for the year's leap forward. The rural youth of our country, together with all the peasants, vigorously engaged in high-yield activities, scientific experiments, and animal husbandry. After overcoming serious natural disasters and achieving a bumper autumn harvest, they immediately threw themselves into the vigorous mass movement for basic farmland water conservancy construction, expanded the planting area of overwintering crops, reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and overfulfilled the task of afforestation. All of these made a powerful contribution to striving for a comprehensive agricultural harvest this year. In the mass cultural revolution movement, eighty million young people across the country participated in spare-time cultural studies, with thirty-two million young people having already entered spare-time primary schools and four million young people having entered spare-time secondary schools. Students in our country's institutions of higher learning and secondary schools, under the unified leadership of the Party, are actively participating in the reform of the teaching system together with their teachers, striving to acquire more, more comprehensive, and newer cultural and scientific knowledge in a shorter period of time, and to more effectively improve their political consciousness, in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction.

The continuous leap forward of our country's socialist construction has further strengthened the communist orientation of our country's youth and promoted a new upsurge in the communist consciousness of youth. This is mainly manifested in: First, more and more young people have established a communist attitude towards labor, that is, a conscious attitude towards labor that benefits society and does not care about remuneration. Second, more and more young people have established a communist style of cooperation and mutual assistance, that is, a style of putting others first and oneself last, helping others and being happy, giving convenience to others, and leaving difficulties to oneself. Third, more and more young people have established communist moral qualities, that is, the moral qualities of putting the revolutionary cause above everything else, putting collective interests above everything else, and sacrificing oneself for the public good.

This great upsurge of communist thought is the most valuable spiritual wealth among all the wealth that the Great Leap Forward has brought us. Politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul. When the broad masses of young people are armed with this communist thought, and do not haggle over personal material interests, they can maximize their enthusiasm and creativity, becoming a huge material force that promotes them to complete and overfulfill production plans, and promote the rapid development of social productive forces in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "A brand-new social system must be built on the base of the old system, and it must clear this base. The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system always remain in people's minds for a long time and are unwilling to retreat easily." The higher the communist thought of the broad masses of young people is developed, and the wider it is spread, the more powerfully it will sweep away all the garbage of bourgeois private ownership left over from the old society, and urge its death. Our Party is a thorough revolutionary party. Our great construction is not only to build a strong and solid economic foundation, but also to build a brand-new and noble spiritual outlook. With a strong economic foundation and a noble spiritual outlook among the people, our great motherland can stand forever in an invincible position, and our people can more consciously follow the Party wholeheartedly towards the great goal of communism.

The great leap forward era will surely create a completely new generation of people, and the rapid growth of this new generation will become a powerful force to promote the progress of the era. To carry forward the communist spirit of youth and promote the continuous upsurge of communist consciousness of youth is our unremitting responsibility.

The reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan ZhenLin, unfold before us the magnificent prospect of continued leap forward in 1960. To achieve the national economic plan for 1960, our great cause will take a big step forward. This is the greatest interest of the people of our country. Therefore, to stand firm in one's post, to try every means, to exert all efforts, and to strive to achieve this year's continued leap forward, is the lofty responsibility of the youth of our country, and also the highest manifestation of the communist consciousness of the youth of our country.

In order to accomplish this task: We must continue to mobilize the youth of the whole country to actively participate in the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, so that it will further become a nationwide, comprehensive, and sustained movement; we must mobilize rural youth to do everything possible to achieve the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule, and strive for a comprehensive agricultural harvest this year with grain as the key link; we must mobilize youth to actively participate in the movement to vigorously run urban people's communes, vigorously run urban and rural public canteens, and vigorously run various collective welfare undertakings; we must organize youth to vigorously engage in spare-time cultural studies and actively participate in large-scale cultural revolution movements; we must mobilize youth and children to actively participate in the great health and sports movement to transform the physique and transform the world. And in order to make contributions in these movements, we must hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and deeply and persistently carry out the rising movement to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, and master Mao Zedong Thought.

Fellow Deputies know that last year, our Party's rectification movement and the nationwide socialist education movement, which was also another great debate on the two roads of the whole nation, greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people to study revolutionary theory. The struggle between the two roads made the youth once again realize that leaving Mao Zedong Thought would lead to losing direction and making various mistakes. Following Mao Zedong Thought will make our cause advance victoriously and be able to contribute more to socialist construction. It was on this basis that a nationwide upsurge of studying Mao Zedong's works and mastering Mao Zedong Thought was formed. Now, 35 million young people have participated in the study. This is a great Marxist-Leninist popularization movement. It marks that the communist education of Chinese youth has entered a new stage, and the communist study of Chinese youth has been raised to a new height. That is to say, the study and research of the invincible Marxist-Leninist theory has shifted from a small number of revolutionary professional revolutionaries and advanced elements to the broad masses of working people, from the older generation to the new generation. Our task is to better develop this movement and arm our country's youth with Mao Zedong Thought.

Being armed with Mao Zedong Thought can greatly improve the ability of young people to understand the world and distinguish right from wrong. Class struggle is the most universal and essential thing in all current international and domestic social phenomena. Our country's entire transition period is filled with class struggle. As our country continues to leap forward and become increasingly powerful, imperialism always vainly attempts to threaten us militarily, sabotage us politically, blockade us economically, and disintegrate us ideologically. The traitors of communism, the agents of imperialism—the modern revisionists—also always use every opportunity to slander us and oppose us. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought can enable our country's youth to stand firm, distinguish between enemies and friends, in the face of complex class struggles. At present, the emergence of a large number of new things such as urban people's communes, urban and rural public canteens, collective welfare undertakings, etc., is the deepening and development of our country's socialist revolution, and is an extremely important link in the high-speed development of socialist undertakings. In the long river of social development, revolution is continuous. Only through continuous revolution can society continue to advance. Guiding things with Mao Zedong Thought can enable young people to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and more consciously and enthusiastically support new things and promote their rapid growth. No matter what cold winds and evil airs may blow, we will stand firm and never waver.

Being armed with Mao Zedong Thought can greatly invigorate the creative spirit of youth. There are two kinds of struggles before us: one is class struggle, and the other is production struggle. Our country's youth should be staunch fighters in class struggle, and also creative fighters in production struggle. The current nationwide and comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the position for cultivating and training our country's youth to have the determination and ability to wage war against nature, against the earth, and against the universe. Guiding things with Mao Zedong Thought can enable our country's youth to not only vigorously engage in mechanization and automation in this movement, but also tackle cutting-edge technologies and climb peaks. It can enable us to continue to emancipate our minds, break down superstitions, and use the tenacious spirit of daring to think and act to break the outdated principles in science and technology, explore new horizons in science, strive to master new operations, and actively promote new experiences. It can enable us to have revolutionary courage in scientific experiments, overcome difficulties, not be afraid of failure, and be good at summing up experience in difficulties and failures, and continue to move forward.

Being armed with Mao Zedong Thought can also enable our generation of youth to have lofty revolutionary ideals and establish great ambitions. This kind of great ambition is concentratedly embodied in always thinking of making contributions to the revolution and the people, having plans for this year, plans for the next few years, and plans for a lifetime. In a lifetime, we must realize the highest ideal of communism. Guiding things with Mao Zedong Thought can combine this kind of great ambition with practical, ordinary, diligent, and brave work. In our country, there are not only the glorious steel army, coal mining army, and grain and cotton army, but also tens of millions of catering armies, tens of millions of childcare armies, service armies, and breeding armies. Our Party earnestly hopes that young people will make special efforts in the latter few positions, which are still weak but very important. Now, young people in many places are carrying out evaluation and competition activities, determined to be good cooks, childminders, service personnel, and breeders for the people. For example, some young cooks in some places have proposed to be the "six-good red banner bearers" of "good public-minded ideology, good pig raising and vegetable growing production, good careful calculation and economy, good reform of tools and technology, good hygiene and cleanliness, and enthusiastic service attitude." In different industries, according to different characteristics, we can vigorously carry out this kind of revolutionary competition activity with clear banners and clear directions, and combine the Party and the state's policies with mass political mobilization, so that we can cultivate our country's youth into a new generation of communists who are both red and expert quickly and well.

Fellow Deputies, facing the first spring of the 1960s, the new upsurge of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country is developing with overwhelming force. Our great helmsman—the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong—are leading us to a great, strong, prosperous, and noble socialist communist goal, riding the wind and waves. I believe that the generation of young people in our country, determined to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, will continue to exert great efforts, overcome all difficulties, and make more contributions in this new year.

### 为祖国持续跃进英勇奋斗是青年共产主义觉悟的最高表现  共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦在人大二次会议上的发言

    为祖国持续跃进英勇奋斗是青年共产主义觉悟的最高表现
    共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理的报告。
    过去的一年，我国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，反右倾，鼓干劲，排除了前进中的各种困难，横扫了某些右倾机会主义分子所吹起的一小股阴风，取得了我国社会主义建设大跃进的第二年的伟大胜利。这个胜利向我们表明，只要我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，紧紧掌握住总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，我们就一定能够在1960年以至整个六十年代，实现更好更全面的持续跃进。
    在1959年的大跃进中，我国各个战线的青年积极响应党的号召，精神奋发，斗志昂扬。当党提出开展全民增产节约运动，完成和超额完成全年计划，提前三年实现第二个五年计划的主要指标的时候，广大青年职工立即掀起了一个“高速度跨进1960年”的强大运动。全国有三百八十多万青年工人和十万个青年集体，提前一个月完成了全年的工作量，接着又有五百多万青年工人和十万个青年集体，提前半个月跨进1960年。在这个战役之后，广大青年职工再接再厉，乘胜前进，同全体职工一道，开展了热火朝天的1960年的开门红竞赛运动，超额完成了今年第一季度的生产任务，为全年的跃进创造了良好的开端。我国农村青年和全体农民一道，大搞丰产活动、科学试验活动和饲养活动，在战胜严重自然灾害、夺取了秋季丰收之后，又马不停蹄，投入了轰轰烈烈的农田水利基本建设运动，扩大了越冬作物的种植面积，开垦了大量的荒地，超额完成了植树造林的任务。所有这些，都为争取今年农业全面丰收作出了有力的贡献。在群众性的文化革命运动中，全国有八千万青年参加了业余文化学习，有三千二百万青年已经进入业余初等学校，有四百万青年进入业余中等学校。我国高等、中等学校的学生，在党的统一领导下，正和教师一道，积极参加教学制度的改革，争取用更短的时间，学得更多更全更新的文化科学知识，更有效地提高政治觉悟，以适应社会主义建设迅速发展的需要。
    我国社会主义建设事业的连续跃进，进一步坚定了我国青年的共产主义方向，促进了青年共产主义觉悟的新高涨。这主要地表现在：第一、越来越多的青年树立了共产主义的劳动态度，这就是自觉的、为社会造福的、不计较报酬的劳动态度。第二、越来越多的青年树立了共产主义的协作互相风气，这就是先人后己、助人为乐、把方便让给别人、把困难留给自己的风气。第三、越来越多的青年树立了共产主义的道德品质，这就是革命事业高于一切、集体利益高于一切、舍己为公的道德品质。
    这种共产主义思想的大高涨，是大跃进带给我们的一切财富中最可宝贵的精神财富。政治是统帅，思想是灵魂。当广大青年用这种共产主义思想武装起来，而不去斤斤计较个人的物质利益的时候，就可以最大限度地发挥积极性和创造性，成为推动他们完成和超额完成生产计划，促进我国社会生产力突飞猛进的巨大的物质力量。毛主席教导我们说：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的”。广大青年这种共产主义思想发扬得越高，传播的越广，就越会有力地扫荡旧社会遗留下来的一切资产阶级私有观念的垃圾，催促它的死亡。我们的党，是个彻底的革命的党。我们进行伟大的建设，不但要建设一个强大的雄厚的经济基础，而且要建设一个崭新的高尚的精神面貌。国家有了强大的经济基础，人民有了高尚的精神面貌，我们的伟大祖国就可以永远立于不败之地，我国人民就更能自觉地万众一心地跟着党走向共产主义的伟大目标。
    伟大的跃进时代，必将造就出一代全新的人，而这代新人的迅速成长，又会成为推动时代前进的一支强大力量。发扬青年的共产主义精神，促进青年共产主义觉悟的不断高涨，这是我们坚持不懈的责任。
    李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告，在我们面前展开了1960年继续跃进的壮丽景象。实现1960年的国民经济计划，我们的伟大事业，就将大大向前迈进一步。这是我国人民的最大利益。因此，站稳自己的岗位，想尽一切办法，使出一切力量，为实现今年的继续跃进而奋斗，是我国青年的崇高责任，也是我国青年共产主义觉悟的最高表现。
    为了实现这个任务：我们要继续动员全国青年，积极投入当前声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动，使它进一步成为全民的、全面的、持久的运动；我们要动员农村青年，千方百计地为提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”，争取今年以粮为纲的农业全面丰收而奋斗；我们要动员青年积极参加大办城市人民公社、大办城乡公共食堂和大办各种集体福利事业的运动；我们要组织青年大搞业余文化学习和积极参加大规模的文化革命运动；我们要动员青年和少年积极投入改造体质、改造世界的伟大的卫生体育运动。而为了在这些运动中做出贡献，就必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，把正在兴起的学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，掌握毛泽东思想的运动，深入地持久地开展下去。
    各位代表知道，去年我们党的整风运动和全民的社会主义教育运动，也就是全民的又一次两条道路的大辩论，极大地提高了广大青年学习革命理论的积极性。两条道路的斗争使青年们又一次体会到离开毛泽东思想，就会迷失方向，就会犯这样那样的错误。按照毛泽东思想办事，就会使我们的事业胜利前进，就能够为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。正是在这个基础上，形成了一个全国规模的学习毛泽东著作，掌握毛泽东思想的热潮。现在，参加学习的青年已经有三千五百万人。这是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的普及运动。它标志着，中国青年共产主义教育进入一个新阶段，中国青年的共产主义学习提到了一个新高度。就是说，学习和研究战无不胜的马克思列宁主义理论，已经从少数革命职业家和先进分子走向了广大劳动群众，从老一代走向了新一代。我们的任务，就是更好地发展这个运动，使我国青年用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来，可以更大地提高青年认识世界，分辨是非的能力。阶级斗争，是当前国际国内一切社会现象中最普遍最本质的东西。我国整个过渡时期都充满着阶级斗争。我们国家不断地飞跃前进，日益强大，帝国主义总是妄想从军事上威胁我们，从政治上破坏我们，从经济上封锁我们，从思想上瓦解我们。共产主义的叛徒、帝国主义的代理人——现代修正主义者，也总是利用一切机会诬蔑我们，反对我们。掌握毛泽东思想，就可以使我国青年在复杂的阶级斗争面前，站稳立场，分清敌友。当前，城市人民公社、城乡公共食堂、集体福利事业等等大量的新生事物的涌现，是我国社会主义革命的深入和发展，是高速度地发展社会主义事业的极其重要的环节。在整个社会发展的长河中，革命是不停顿的。只有不断革命，社会才能不断前进。用毛泽东思想挂帅，就可以使青年发扬不断革命精神，更加自觉、更加满腔热情地支持新事物，促进它们的迅速成长。任凭吹什么冷风邪气，都站稳脚跟，决不动摇。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来，可以更大地振奋青年的创造精神。在我们面前，有两种斗争：一是阶级斗争，一是生产斗争。我国青年应当是阶级斗争中的坚强的战士，也应当是生产斗争中富有创造精神的战士。当前全民的全面的技术革新和技术革命运动，就是培养和锻炼我国青年有决心、有能力向自然开战，向地球开战，向宇宙开战的阵地。用毛泽东思想挂帅，我国青年在这个运动中，就既能够大搞机械化、自动化，又能够攻尖端、攀高峰。就可以使我们继续解放思想，破除迷信，以顽强的敢想敢干的精神，去打破科学技术上的那些陈旧的过时的原理，探索科学的新天地，努力掌握新操作，积极推广新经验。就可以在科学试验中，具有革命胆略，战胜困难，不怕失败，并且善于在困难和失败中，总结经验，继续前进。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来，又可以使我们这一代青年具有远大的革命理想，树立雄心壮志。这种雄心壮志，就是集中地体现在总是一心想着要为革命、为人民做出一番贡献，有今年的打算，有今后几年的打算，有一生的打算。在一生中间，一定要实现共产主义的最高理想。用毛泽东思想挂帅，就能够把这种雄心壮志同踏实的、平凡的、勤劳勇敢的工作结合起来。在我们的国家里，不但有光荣的钢铁大军、采煤大军、粮棉大军，而且还有几千万人的炊事大军，成千万人的保育大军，服务大军，饲养大军。我们的党，殷切地希望青年在后面这几个现在还薄弱、但是十分重要的岗位上，特别出力。现在，很多地方的青年正在开展评比竞赛活动，下决心当好人民的炊事员、保育员、服务员、饲养员。比如有些地方的青年炊事员同志，就提出了要做“大公无私思想好、养猪种菜生产好、精打细算节约好、改革工具技术好、讲究卫生清洁好、热心服务态度好”的六好红旗手。在不同的行业中，按照不同的特点，把这种旗帜鲜明、方向明确的革命竞赛活动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，把党和国家的政策和群众性的政治动员配合起来，我们就能够又多又快又好地把我国青年培养成又红又专的共产主义新一代。
    各位代表，迎着六十年代的第一个春天，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮，正以排山倒海之势向前发展。我们伟大的舵手——中国共产党和毛泽东同志，率领着我们正在向着一个伟大的、强盛的、繁荣的、高尚的社会主义共产主义的目标，乘风破浪地前进。我相信，决心用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国青年一代，一定会继续大鼓干劲，压倒一切困难，在这新的一年里，做出更多的贡献。
