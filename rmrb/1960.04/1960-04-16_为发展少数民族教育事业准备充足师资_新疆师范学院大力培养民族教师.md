    To prepare sufficient teaching staff for the development of ethnic minority education, Xinjiang Teachers College is vigorously training ethnic minority teachers.
    (By our newspaper) Xinjiang Teachers College is actively training ethnic minority teachers by means of in-service advanced studies and full-time advanced studies. With the help of Han teachers, more than 88 of the college's 150-plus Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic minority teachers are now lecturing, most of whom are recent graduates from the college in the past two or three years.
    Xinjiang Teachers College is a multi-ethnic higher education institution founded not long ago. About 70% of the college's students are ethnic minorities, requiring a large number of ethnic minority teachers. Since last year, the number of ethnic minority teachers in the college has increased to more than 150, accounting for more than 50% of all teachers. Most of these ethnic minority teachers lack teaching experience and sufficient professional knowledge, and many cannot teach or can only teach elementary courses. However, when Han teachers lecture to ethnic minority students, they must use translation. In addition to extending the study period by one time due to the need for translation (a four-year course must be taught for eight years), the more important thing is that many professional courses cannot be completely translated due to the lack of professional translators, and the teaching quality is also greatly affected. In order to help ethnic minority teachers master teaching skills and improve their professional knowledge level as soon as possible, the college's Party committee has especially listed the training of ethnic minority teachers as the central work of the Party committee. All 18 teaching and research groups in the college have formulated training plans and selected 55 Han teachers with teaching experience and relatively rich professional knowledge to be specifically responsible for helping ethnic minority teachers.
    The college's training of ethnic minority teachers is mainly based on in-service advanced studies, supplemented by full-time advanced studies. Six departments in the college have established dozens of professional advanced study groups for ethnic minority teachers in biology, mathematics, physics, etc., and most of the ethnic minority teachers have participated in professional group studies. The method of advanced study is that experienced teachers give special lectures in class, and provide specific guidance in their spare time. The content of study is mostly based on the courses that ethnic minority teachers are about to teach. In this way, each ethnic minority teacher has undergone a considerable period of advanced study before taking the stage to teach, and the teaching level has been greatly improved. In the last semester, 21 new ethnic minority teachers started teaching, and in the Department of Mathematics and Physics, six ethnic minority teachers who originally taught secondary vocational courses started teaching university courses. As the number of classes continues to increase, many new professional courses need to be offered, but ethnic minority teachers have not taught these courses in the past. According to this situation, the teaching and research groups of each department designated special personnel to provide specific assistance. Han teachers and ethnic minority teachers in each major have signed mutual assistance contracts for joint lesson preparation and mutual classroom observation to help ethnic minority teachers prepare teaching materials and compile lecture notes. In the past, some higher-level physics, chemistry, and mathematics courses did not have Uyghur lecture notes and teaching syllabuses, and classes could not be offered. With the help of Han teachers in the mutual assistance group, this was also successfully resolved. Botany teachers Alongfu and Yimingjiang (Uyghur) were both teaching botany for the first time and had difficulty compiling lecture notes and teaching syllabuses. Han teacher Lin Weici helped them prepare lessons chapter by chapter, and Alongfu and Yimingjiang learned and taught at the same time. They not only successfully completed the teaching task but also compiled a complete set of botany lecture notes and teaching syllabuses and can teach independently. Kazakh young teacher Kezierhan had never lectured before, so Han teacher Zhou Jixia enthusiastically helped him compile lecture notes and prepare teaching materials. The two also observed each other's classes, and when there were questions, Zhou Jixia would repeatedly explain them to him after class. In this way, Kezierhan taught the first-year university physics course for the first time this semester. Kezierhan said with emotion: "Things that I never dared to think about in the past have been achieved with the help of Han teachers!"
    In the past, ethnic minority teachers could not read many Chinese reference books because they did not know Chinese, and there were very few reference books for higher education courses translated into ethnic minority languages, which not only affected the quality of teaching but also caused many difficulties for ethnic minority teachers to further improve. Under the principle of combining professional advanced studies with Chinese language learning, each department adopted various methods to help ethnic minority teachers learn Chinese. All ethnic minority teachers in the college participated in Chinese language classes, using one hour a day to learn Chinese. Now each ethnic minority teacher has learned about 1,000 Chinese words, can listen and speak Mandarin, and some can also read Chinese physics, mathematics, and other reference books, strengthening their self-study ability and improving their teaching level. Uyghur teacher Abudu Rehman, who was teaching analytical chemistry for the first time, collected a large number of Chinese reference books due to his good command of Chinese in the absence of Uyghur textbooks. Whenever he encountered something he did not understand, he exchanged opinions with veteran Han teachers at any time, overcame difficulties, and compiled very high-quality lecture notes. His lectures were also profound and were welcomed by students. In order to enable ethnic minority teachers to receive further education, a Chinese language advanced study class for ethnic minority teachers was also specially set up in the Chinese Department. After 27 Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority teachers learn Chinese well, they will go to universities in Beijing, Xi'an, and other places for full-time advanced studies. (Attached picture)

    为发展少数民族教育事业准备充足师资
    新疆师范学院大力培养民族教师
    本报讯　新疆师范学院采用在职进修和脱产进修等办法，积极培养少数民族教师。这个学院的一百五十多名维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜等民族教师，经过汉族教师的帮助，目前已有八十八名登台讲课，其中大部分是最近两三年刚从这个学院毕业的学生。
    新疆师范学院，是一所建校不久的多民族高等学校。这个学院的学生70％左右是少数民族，需要大量少数民族教师。从去年起，全院民族教师已增加到一百五十多名，占全部教师50％以上。这些民族教师大部分缺乏教学经验，专业知识也不足，很多人不能开课或只能开初级课。但是汉族教师给民族学生讲课必须通过翻译，除了因讲课需要翻译把学习期限延长一倍（四年课要讲八年）外，更重要的是许多专业课因缺乏专业翻译人材，内容不能完整地译出来，教学质量也受到很大影响。为了帮助民族教师尽快掌握教学业务，提高各科专业知识水平，院党委特别把培养少数民族教师列为党委的中心工作。全院十八个教研组都制订了培养计划，抽出五十五名有教学经验和专业知识比较丰富的汉族教师，专门负责帮助少数民族教师。
    这个学院培养民族教师是以在职进修为主，脱产进修为辅。全院六个系成立了生物、数学、物理等几十个民族教师专业进修组，绝大部分民族教师都参加了专业组学习。进修办法是由老教师课堂作专题讲授，课余作具体辅导。学习内容大部是根据民族教师所担任的即将开讲的课程。这样，每个民族教师在登台讲课之前，都经过了相当时期的进修，教学水平有很大提高。在上学期就有二十一名民族新教师开了课，数理系有六个原来教中等专业课的民族教师开了大学课。由于班次不断增加，需开许多新的专业课，而过去民族教师都没开过这些课。各系教研组根据这种情况，指定专人进行具体帮助。各专业汉族教师和民族教师都订了联合备课、互相随堂听课的互助合同，帮助民族教师准备教材，编写讲义。过去一些高年级的理化、数学等课程没有维吾尔文讲义和教学大纲，开不成课。通过互助组的汉族教师从旁协助也顺利解决了。植物学教师阿龙甫和依明江（维吾尔族）都是第一次讲植物学，编写讲义和教学大纲有困难。汉族教师林维慈逐章逐节帮助他们备课，阿龙甫和依明江边学边教，不仅顺利完成了教学任务，还编成一套完整的植物讲义和教学大纲，可以独立开课了。哈萨克族年轻教师克孜尔汗，过去从未讲过课，汉族教师周季霞就热心帮助他编写讲义、准备教材。两个人还互相随堂听课，遇有疑问，周季霞就在课后反复给他讲解。就这样，克孜尔汗在本学期第一次开讲了大学一年级物理课。克孜尔汗感动地说：“过去连想也不敢想的事情，在汉族教师帮助下作到了！”
    民族教师过去由于不认识汉文、很多汉文参考书不能阅读，而翻译成少数民族文字的高等学校课程参考书又很少，不仅影响教学质量，对民族教师进一步提高也有很多困难。各系在专业进修和汉语学习相结合的原则下，采用各种方式帮助民族教师学通汉文。全院所有民族教师都参加了汉语学习班，每天利用一个小时学汉文，现在每个民族教师都已学一千个左右汉语词，能听能说普通话，有的还能阅读汉文物理、数学等参考书，加强了自修能力，提高了教学水平。第一次讲分析化学的维吾尔族教师阿不都·热合满，由于汉文学得好，在没有维吾尔文教材的情况下，搜集了大量汉文参考书，遇有不懂地方就随时和汉族老教师交换意见，克服了困难，自己编写了质量很好的讲义，课也讲的深透，受到学生欢迎。为了使民族教师得到深造，在汉语系里还专设了民族教师汉文进修班，二十七名维吾尔、哈萨克等民族教师学好汉文后，将到北京、西安等地高等院校脱产进修。（附图片）
