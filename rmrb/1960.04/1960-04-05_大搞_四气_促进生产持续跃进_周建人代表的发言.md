Vigorously promoting "Four Gases" (coal gas, steam, natural gas, biogas) is an important measure for vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization and rational utilization of resources. The benefits are: greatly reducing fuel consumption and saving coal; increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, and reducing costs; improving labor conditions and reducing labor intensity; and promoting technological innovation in other production links.

Fellow Delegates:

I fully support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will report to the conference on the situation of Zhejiang Province's vigorous promotion of "Four Gases" (coal gas, steam, natural gas, biogas).

1960 is a year of better, more comprehensive, and continuous great leap forward. This year, the province requires that major industrial products such as steel and coal achieve multiple increases, and that major agricultural products such as grain and cotton achieve leap forward development. The primary key to achieving this arduous task is to vigorously engage in a technological innovation and revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and to substantially increase labor productivity. As of March 15, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of industry, transportation, and capital construction above the county level in the province had reached 63%; labor productivity in February this year increased by 16.4% compared with December last year. The increase in labor productivity and equipment capacity has greatly increased the production capacity of enterprises, which has created a contradiction of insufficient fuel supply. In this situation, a small number of people lacked confidence in overcoming this difficulty and developed right-leaning and fearful thinking about whether this year's continuous great leap forward could be achieved. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of cadres and people further promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and were determined to emit more heat with the same amount of coal, open up new energy sources, and launch a mass movement to widely utilize coal gas, steam, natural gas, and biogas. Currently, this movement is developing vigorously.

Our province focuses on coal gasification and vigorously promotes the "Four Gases" movement, which has experienced a process of creating public opinion, creating momentum, establishing models, formulating plans, and fully launching. At the beginning of this year, after the advanced experience of Hongqiao Commune in Yueqing County using coal gas flame furnaces to forge iron, Changxing Pottery Factory using coal gas to fire kilns, the guesthouse of the Provincial People's Committee Administration Bureau using steam to steam rice, and Wenzhou City using natural gas as fuel appeared, the Provincial Party Committee and the County People's Committee seized these advanced seedlings and immediately held on-site meetings in Changxing and other places to summarize them and make a decision to vigorously promote "Four Gases" throughout the province. The Provincial People's Committee specifically convened a province-wide broadcast conference, speaking extensively about the uses of "Four Gases," and deployed the formulation of plans for vigorously promoting "Four Gases" from top to bottom. In a few dozen days, a comprehensive and nationwide movement involving workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, both men and women, old and young, was launched to vigorously promote "Four Gases." The momentum of the movement was as great as that of the large-scale steelmaking campaign. The leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel of Jinhua County combined and established ten leading groups according to the system, organized more than 7,000 people, and after three days of preparation and five days of blitz, basically realized coal gasification. From towns to villages, from factories to schools, thousands of units and more than 10,000 people in Changxing County plunged into battle, enthusiastically marching towards "Four Gases," and successively organized more than 290 furnace construction shock teams and 42 technical exchange groups, widely展开 furnace construction activities. In half a month, more than 1,700 were built, of which 1,381 were already in use, accounting for 81%.

The "Four Gases" movement has developed extremely rapidly, and the scope of application is expanding day by day. Since February, an average of more than 500 coal gas stoves have been built and put into production every day. As of March 15, the number of coal gas stoves in the province has increased to 34,000, of which more than 6,000 are used for industrial production. At present, coal gas stoves are not only used for burning ceramics, bricks, tiles, and cement, but are also further used for forging iron, melting iron, smelting iron sand, generating electricity, and running ships and automobiles. Coal gas has been widely used in boilers under five tons throughout the province, and Hangzhou Power Plant has broken through the technical barrier of mixing coal gas in fifty-ton boilers. Ningbo Transportation Company uses coal gas to run cars and natural gas to start machines. Steam stoves have also been widely promoted in public canteens, the catering industry and other departments throughout the province.

The "Four Gases" movement is constantly improving in popularization. Through development and summarization, we have affirmed five types of furnaces with universal promotion significance and have initially accumulated operating experience for coal gas stoves and steam stoves. In counties such as Changxing, coal gas supply stations have begun to be established, making the use of coal gas more widespread.

Practice has proven that vigorously promoting "Four Gases" is an important measure for vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization and rational utilization of resources, and it is also an important link in realizing the continuous great leap forward in production. From the actual situation in our province, the effect is extremely significant.

First, fuel consumption has been greatly reduced, and coal has been saved. Generally, 30% to 50% of coal can be saved, and in some cases, more than 70% can be saved. The Changxing Pottery Factory uses coal gas to fire kilns, and coal consumption has dropped from five or six tons per kiln to two or three tons. Fifty restaurants in Wenzhou City have achieved coal gasification and steamification, saving 50% of coal; Yongqiang Production Team of Yongjia County Yongqiang Commune, a canteen for 200 people, used to burn more than 150 catties of firewood every day. After using natural gas, it doesn't use a single catty, saving 54,000 catties of firewood annually. If the province saves 30% of coal, the coal saved annually can be used to refine 250,000 tons of iron and generate 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Using coal gas instead of oil can save about 3,000 tons of diesel annually.

Second, labor productivity has been improved, product quality has been improved, and costs have been reduced, effectively guaranteeing the leap forward in production. For example, Hongqiao Agricultural Machinery Factory in Yueqing County, using coal gas to heat iron, increased labor efficiency by 4.5 times, saved 24 workers, reduced costs by 34.8%, and achieved a 100% pass rate. Hangzhou Gongsheng Brick and Tile Factory used coal gas to fire bricks, reducing coal consumption by 50.64%, shortening the kiln firing time from 72 hours to 22 hours, and reducing costs by 25.65%. After realizing coal gasification, Changxing County not only completed the first quarter's industrial output value plan 28 days ahead of schedule, but also saved more than 2,500 tons of coal.

Third, labor conditions have been improved and labor intensity has been reduced. Boiler workers reported: In the past, the furnace was easy to burn, but it was difficult to get through the two evils (heat evil, dirty evil). After using coal gas, not only has the number of times of adding coal and discharging slag been reduced, but also the phenomenon of coal ash flying has been basically eliminated, and sanitary conditions have been greatly improved. Boiler workers praised: Coal gas stove is good, production exceeds every day, working is clean, and labor is easy. Cooks reflected: The steam stove is a treasure, saving labor, saving fuel, and cooking rice quickly and well.

Fourth, after vigorously promoting "Four Gases," it has promoted the technological innovation of other production links. For example, after the machinery factory used coal gas stoves, due to the high furnace temperature, strong flame, and fast discharge, the situation of "iron urging people to forge" appeared, which promoted the reform of the original tools, equipment and labor organization of the iron forging process.

Fifth, it has further promoted ideological redness. The "Four Gases" movement, like the entire technological innovation and technological revolution, is not only a production movement, but also an ideological liberation movement. After the successful experiment of the steam stove in the guesthouse of the Provincial People's Committee Administration Bureau, it prompted all the cooks in the bureau to break superstitions and liberate their minds. After four days of hard work, all the stoves of the 19 units under the bureau were coal gasified and steamified. The complete innovation of stoves and cooking utensils has greatly improved labor efficiency, not only saving labor, but also allowing cooks to have more time to participate in political, cultural, and technical studies. In the industrial use of coal gas, some people were initially afraid of insecurity and did not dare to actively experiment. After practice, they understood that coal gas is not mysterious and unpredictable. As long as they master its laws, it can serve production. In rural areas, the use of natural gas also broke the superstitious ideas of a few people. In a natural village in Yongqiang Commune, Wenzhou, the masses had no idea what natural gas was. There was a major fire, and the masses discussed it and thought it was the fault of gods and ghosts. Now that natural gas has been utilized, it has solved their doubts and broken superstitions.

At present, the benefits of "Four Gases" have been basically known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The masses praised: "Four Gases have seven major advantages, promoting production to exceed every day, saving labor and materials, gas can also be burned as coal, reducing costs and improving quality, labor intensity is very light, promoting innovation is too good, and ideological liberation is the first."

The great achievements of our province in vigorously promoting "Four Gases" are a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction. From the practice of vigorously promoting "Four Gases," we have more deeply realized that in the continuous great leap forward of the national economy, imbalance is always present. The question is what attitude we take towards imbalance: do we actively take measures to overcome weak links and promote the backward to catch up with the advanced to achieve positive balance? Or do we shrink back in fear of difficulties, accommodate the backward, and slow down the speed of construction? These are two fundamentally different attitudes towards the general line. Vigorously promoting "Four Gases" has major political and economic significance. It not only provides better material conditions for this year's and future continuous great leap forward, but also greatly inspires the broad masses of people to overcome difficulties and march into nature. Of course, our utilization of "Four Gases" is only the beginning, and we must carry out a series of technical and organizational work to continuously develop, consolidate, and improve the movement. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as long as we adhere to politics in command, continue to revolutionize, and vigorously engage in mass movements, we will surely achieve greater results on the basis of victory, and utilize "Four Gases" more widely and more effectively, so as to promote the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    大搞“四气”促进生产持续跃进
    周建人代表的发言
    大搞“四气”（煤气、蒸气、天然气、沼气），是大搞综合利用、合理利用资源的一项重要措施。其好处是：大大降低燃料的消耗、节约煤炭；提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本；改善劳动条件，减轻劳动强度；促进其它生产环节的技术革新。各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，以及人大常委会的工作报告。现在，我将浙江省大搞“四气”（煤气、蒸气、天然气、沼气）的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    1960年是更好的全面的持续大跃进的一年。今年，本省要求钢、煤等主要工业产品都有成倍的增长，粮、棉等主要农业产品都有跃进的发展。实现这个艰巨任务的首要关键，就是要大搞以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，大幅度地提高劳动生产率。到3月15日止，全省县以上的工业、交通运输、基本建设的机械化、半机械化操作已达到63％；劳动生产率今年2月份比去年12月提高了16.4％。劳动生产率和设备能力的提高，使企业的生产能力有了很大增长，这样，就产生燃料供应不足的矛盾。在这种情况下，曾经有少数人对克服这个困难没有信心，对能否实现今年持续大跃进产生了右倾畏难思想。但是，广大干部和群众，在党的领导下，进一步发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，决心以同样数量的煤炭发出更多的热量，开辟新的能源，开展了广泛利用煤气、蒸气、天然气、沼气的群众运动，目前，这个运动正在蓬勃地向前发展。
    我省以煤气化为重点，大搞煤气、蒸气、天然气、沼气的“四气”运动，经历了大造舆论、大造声势、树立标兵、制订规划、全面展开的过程。今年年初，我省乐清县虹桥公社出现使用煤气火焰炉打铁，长兴陶器厂使用煤气烧窑，省人委机关事务管理局招待所使用蒸气蒸饭，温州市使用天然气作燃料等先进经验后，省委和县人委抓住这些先进苗头，立即在长兴等地召开现场会议，进行总结，作出在全省大搞“四气”的决定。省人民委员会专门召开了全省性的广播大会，大讲“四气”的用处，并且部署自上而下制定大搞“四气”的规划。在几十天的时间内，全省就掀起了一个工农商学兵、男女老少一齐动手的全面性和全民性的大搞“四气”运动。运动声势之大，有如大办钢铁。金华县的领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合，按系统成立了十个领导小组，组织了七千多人，经过三天准备，五天突击，基本实现了煤气化。长兴县从城镇到农村，从工厂到学校，全县数以千计的单位一万余人，投入战斗，热火朝天，向“四气”进军，同时先后组织了二百九十多个建炉突击队和四十二个技术交流小组，广泛展开了建炉活动，在半个月内，就建成一千七百余只；其中已经使用的有一千三百八十一只，占81％。
    “四气”运动发展极其迅速，应用范围日益扩大。2月份以来，平均每天有五百余只煤气炉建成投入生产。到3月15日止，全省煤气炉已发展到三万四千只，其中用于工业生产的有六千余只。目前，煤气炉不仅用在烧陶瓷、砖瓦、水泥、石灰，并且进一步用于锻铁、化铁、炼铁砂、发电以及开轮船、汽车等方面。全省五吨以下的锅炉已经普遍使用煤气，杭州电厂突破了五十吨锅炉掺用煤气的技术关。宁波市运输公司利用煤气开汽车，并用天然气发动机器。蒸气灶也已在全省的公共食堂、饮食业等部门普遍推广。
    “四气”运动在普及中不断提高。我们通过边发展、边总结，已经肯定了五种具有普遍推广意义的炉型，初步积累了煤气炉、蒸气灶的操作经验。在长兴等县，开始兴办了煤气供应站，使煤气的使用更为广泛。
    实践证明：大搞“四气”，是大搞综合利用、合理利用资源的一项重要措施，也是实现生产持续大跃进的重要环节。从本省的实际情况看，其效果是极其显著的。
    第一、大大降低了燃料的消耗，节约了煤炭。一般能节约煤炭30％至50％，高的达70％以上。长兴陶器厂用煤气烧窑，煤耗从每窑五、六吨下降到二、三吨。温州市五十家饮食店实现了煤气化和蒸气化，用煤节省了50％；永嘉县永强公社上京生产队一个二百人用膳的食堂，过去每天烧木柴一百五十余斤，利用天然气后，一斤也不用了，全年可节约木柴五万四千斤。全省如以节约用煤30％计算，全年所节约的煤炭，可以炼二十五万吨铁，发十二亿度电。以煤气代油，全年约可节约柴油三千吨左右。
    第二、提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本，有力地保证了生产的跃进。如乐清县虹桥农业机械厂，用煤气红铁工效提高四点五倍，节约劳动力二十四人，成本降低三十四点八，正品率达到100％。杭州拱墅砖瓦厂用煤气烧砖，耗煤量降低50.64％，烧窑时间从七十二小时压缩到二十二小时，成本降低25.65％。长兴县实现煤气化后，不仅提前二十八天完成了第一季度的工业产值计划，还节约了二千五百多吨煤。
    第三、改善劳动条件，减轻劳动强度。司炉工人反映：过去炉子好烧，二煞难过（热煞、脏煞）。用煤气后，不仅加煤、出渣次数减少，而且煤灰飞扬的现象基本消灭，卫生条件大为改善。司炉工人赞扬说：煤气炉子好，生产日日超，做活既清洁，劳动又轻巧。炊事员反映：蒸气灶是个宝，省人工，省燃料，烧起饭来快又好。
    第四、大搞“四气”后，促进了其它生产环节的技术革新。如机械厂使用煤气炉后，由于炉温高、火焰烈、出料快，出现“铁催人锻”，推动了锻铁工序的原有工具设备和劳动组织的改革。
    第五、进一步推动了思想红。“四气”运动同整个技术革新和技术革命一样，既是生产运动，也是思想解放运动。省人委机关事务管理局招待所蒸气灶试验成功后，促进了该局所有炊事人员破除迷信，解放思想，经过四天的奋战，使全局所属十九个单位的炉灶全部实现了煤气化和蒸气化。炉灶和炊具的成套革新，大大提高了劳动效率，不仅节约了劳动力，而且使炊事人员有更多的时间参加政治、文化、技术学习。在工业上使用煤气，开始时曾有少数人害怕不安全，不敢积极试验，经过实践，懂得了煤气并不是神秘莫测，只要掌握了它的规律，就能够为生产服务。在农村，使用天然气还破除了少数群众迷信鬼神的思想，温州永强公社有个自然村，群众过去根本不知道天然气是怎么一回事，曾经发生过一次大火灾，群众议论纷纷，以为神鬼作怪，现在天然气被利用后，解开了他们的疑团，破除了迷信思想。
    目前，“四气”的好处，已经基本上做到家喻户晓，深得人心，群众歌颂道：“四气共有七大好，推动生产日日超，既省劳力又省料，气体也可当煤烧，降低成本质量高，劳动强度很轻巧，促进革新木佬佬，解放思想第一条。”
    我省大搞“四气”的巨大成就，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。从大搞“四气”的实践中，使我们更加深刻地认识到，在国民经济持续大跃进中，不平衡是经常存在的，问题是我们对待不平衡抱什么态度，是积极采取措施，克服薄弱环节，促进落后赶上先进求得积极平衡呢？还是畏难退缩，迁就落后，放慢建设速度？这是对待总路线的两种根本不同的态度。大搞“四气”，具有重大的政治意义和经济意义，它不仅为今年和今后的持续大跃进提供了更好的物质条件，而且大大地鼓舞了广大群众战胜困难，向自然界进军的信心和决心。当然，我们利用“四气”还只是开始，还要进行一系列的技术工作和组织工作，使运动不断发展，不断巩固和提高。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，只要我们坚持政治挂帅，不断革命，大搞群众运动，我们一定能够在胜利的基础上取得更大的成绩，把“四气”更加广泛、更加有效地利用起来，促进工农业生产的持续跃进。
    以上发言，不当之处，请代表们批评指正。
