Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanxi Province, which has historically had little fish farming, is now universally raising fish. The province's fish farming area has expanded to over 500,000 mu, nearly doubling the area in 1959.

This year, many communes in the Yellow River region of Shanxi Province have established fishing stations and professional fishing teams, adopting the method of catching large fish to raise large fish, and catching small fish to raise small fish. Parent fish and fingerlings are also being raised separately, solving the problem of fry supply locally. The Shanxi Provincial Aquatic Products Department has also organized more than 100 people to go to Hubei Province to prepare for the introduction of some fish fry. Various localities are actively digging ponds, building reservoirs, and planning reservoirs to expand the fish farming area. The Xizhuang Commune in Lüliang County, located in the Lüliang Mountains, built "artificial lakes" on mountains over 2,000 meters above sea level and has already fished out more than 30,000 carp from the Yellow River to stock in the lakes. Jinshatan, the famous ancient battlefield in northern Shanxi, has also stocked more than 200,000 fish in the reservoirs built this spring.

Shanxi Province has a high terrain, with mountainous areas accounting for more than 76% of the province. Before liberation, fish farming was rare. After liberation, with the great development of water conservancy construction, fish farming has also gradually developed. In particular, with the emergence of people's communes, overall arrangements for various productions not only solved difficulties in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources, but also created favorable conditions for the utilization of water resources, fishing, and transportation tools. In 1959, the province's fish farming area reached more than 270,000 mu, nearly tripling the total fish farming area before communization, and 2 million jin of mature fish were harvested.

    山西人破格大养鱼
    全省养鱼水面达五十万亩，比去年扩大一倍
    据新华社讯  一向很少养鱼的山西省，今年普遍养鱼，全省养鱼水面已扩大到五十万亩以上，比1959年扩大将近一倍。
    今年，山西省沿黄河地区许多公社建立捕捞站和捕捞专业队，采取捞大养大、捞小养小的办法，并把亲鱼、鱼种都分别放养起来，就地解决鱼苗来源。山西省水产部门还组织一百多人到湖北省，准备引进一部分鱼苗。各地积极挖池、修塘、规划水库，扩大养鱼水面。吕梁山区吕梁县西庄公社在海拔二千多米的山上修挖“人造湖”，已从黄河打捞了三万多尾鲤鱼，放养在湖里。晋北著名的古战场——金沙滩，也在今春修成的水库里放养了二十多万尾鱼。
    山西省地势高，山区面积达76％多，解放前，很少养鱼，解放后随着水利建设大发展，养鱼事业也逐步发展。特别是人民公社一出现，各项生产统筹安排，不仅解决了人力物力财力等方面的困难，同时在水利资源、打捞和运输工具利用上都创造了有利条件，1959年全省养鱼水面达到了二十七万多亩，比公社化以前养鱼水面的总和增加了近三倍，捕捞成鱼二百万斤。
