Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, April 26th. Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the airport upon arriving in Kathmandu today. The full text is as follows:

    Respected Prime Minister Koirala, dear friends:

    Three years ago, I visited your beautiful country, and the sincere friendship you expressed to the Chinese people is still deeply etched in my memory. Today, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to visit your country again shortly after Prime Minister Koirala's visit to China. I bring the profound friendship and cordial greetings of the 650 million Chinese people to the people of Nepal.

    We are very pleased to see the new development of the traditional friendship between China and Nepal since the establishment of diplomatic relations. Recently, during Prime Minister Koirala's visit to our country, we reached satisfactory agreements on the boundary issue and economic assistance between our two countries. These agreements not only add a new page to the history of friendly cooperation between China and Nepal, but also set a good example for Asian countries to get along with each other on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    I hope that our visit will help to further enhance our mutual understanding, and that through discussions on issues of common concern, the precious friendship between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

    Finally, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to express our heartfelt thanks to the Nepalese government and people for giving us such a warm welcome.

    Long live the friendship between China and Nepal!

    Long live the unity of Asian and African countries!

    Long live The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit!

    Long live world peace!

    在加德满都机场上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社加德满都26日电　周恩来总理今天到达加德满都时，在飞机场上发表讲话，全文如下：尊敬的柯伊拉腊首相阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    三年前，我访问了你们美丽的国家，你们对中国人民所表达的真挚友谊，至今还深刻地留在我的记忆里。今天，我能够在柯伊拉腊首相阁下访问中国后不久，有机会再一次来到你们的国家感到格外的高兴。我为尼泊尔人民带来了六亿五千万中国人民的深厚友谊和亲切的问候。
    我们十分满意地看到，自从中尼两国建立外交关系以来，两国间的传统友谊得到了新的发展。最近，柯伊拉腊首相阁下在我国访问期间，我们双方就两国间的边界问题和经济援助问题，达成了圆满的协议。这些协议不仅在中尼友好合作关系的历史上增添了新的一页，而且为亚洲国家在五项原则基础上彼此友好相处树立了良好的榜样。
    我希望，我们的这次访问能有助于使我们彼此间的了解得到进一步的增进，同时通过双方对共同关心的问题的商谈，使我们两国间的珍贵友谊更加巩固和发展。
    最后，请允许我代表中国政府和人民衷心感谢尼泊尔政府和人民给予我们这样热烈的欢迎。
    中尼友好万岁！
    亚非国家团结万岁！
    和平共处五项原则和万隆精神万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
