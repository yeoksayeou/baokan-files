    A Call for Justice from Aegina Island, Greece
    Imprisoned National Resistance Fighters Demand Freedom
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Representatives of the 420 political prisoners in the Aegina Island prison in Greece recently issued an appeal to the world, asking for support for their demand that the Greek government release them.
    The appeal stated that they, and the 2,500 political prisoners held in other prisons in Greece, are fighters for national resistance, democracy, and peace, who have been imprisoned by the Greek authorities for ten to fifteen years.
    The appeal said, "We are imprisoned only because of our activities against the Hitlerite gangs during the occupation and our adherence to our political beliefs."
    The appeal said, "The Greek people have repeatedly expressed in various ways their hope that the government will grant amnesty. In fact, amnesty is necessary to strive for domestic peace and progress in Greece."
    The appeal pointed out that the Greek government, which has already pardoned Hitlerite war criminals, refuses to grant them amnesty. The appeal said, "Although the Hitlerite executioners cannot be compared with the fighters of the national resistance movement, we must emphasize that the government's pardon of war criminals has created a moral problem, making our release and the declaration of amnesty a necessity."

    希腊爱吉哪岛上的正义呼吁
    被囚禁的民族抵抗运动战士要求获得自由
    据新华社11日讯　希腊爱吉哪岛监狱的四百二十名政治犯代表不久前向世界发出呼吁，要求支持他们提出的要希腊政府释放他们的要求。
    呼吁书说，他们，以及被关在希腊其他监狱中的二千五百名政治犯，都是民族抵抗运动、民主与和平的战士，他们被希腊当局已经关了十年到十五年了。
    呼吁书说，“我们被监禁只是由于我们在被占领期间进行反对希特勒匪帮的活动，以及我们坚持我们的政治信念。”
    呼吁书说，“希腊人民用各种方法一再表示他们希望政府大赦，事实上，大赦是争取在希腊建立国内和平和进步所必需的。”
    呼吁书指出，已经赦免了希特勒匪帮战犯的希腊政府却拒绝对他们大赦。呼吁书说，“虽然不能把希特勒匪帮刽子手同民族抵抗运动战士相比，但是我们要强调说，由于政府对战犯的宽赦，政府又造成了一个道义问题，使释放我们和宣布大赦成为必要的事情。”
