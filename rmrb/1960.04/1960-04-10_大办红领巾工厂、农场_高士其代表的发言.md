Vigorously Run Red Scarf Factories and Farms
Speech by Representative Gao Shiqi

We should cultivate in children, from an early age, the habit of loving science and labor, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and establish lofty aspirations to become small scientists and small inventors.

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960,” Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 Draft State Budget,” Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin’s “Strive to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule” report, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I am elated and encouraged by the high-speed development of our national economy and the rapid progress of socialist construction.

Now, I would like to make a brief speech on the issue of actively carrying out scientific and technological activities for children and vigorously running Red Scarf factories and Red Scarf farms.

This is not a small matter. Don't think that children's affairs are minor; this issue is related to the future of the motherland. The generation of children is a strong reserve force of the motherland, an army full of powerful vitality.

Today, the children are Red Scarves; tomorrow, they will be the pacesetters of the General Line, the red banner bearers of the Great Leap Forward, and the heroic figures in building socialism and communism.

We should cultivate in children, from an early age, the habit of loving science and labor, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and establish lofty aspirations to become small scientists and small inventors, actively participate in scientific and technological activities, climb the peaks of science and technology, and build the motherland into a more beautiful, more prosperous, and happier earthly paradise.

Under the current new revolutionary situation, illuminated by the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the desire and ideal of carrying out scientific and technological activities for children and vigorously running Red Scarf factories and Red Scarf farms is entirely possible to realize, and some places have already successfully carried it out.

During my inspection in Ningbo, I saw many new things and received extremely profound education, encouragement, and inspiration. Among them, I was most interested in the Red Scarf Pharmaceutical Factory of Cangshui Street Primary School and the Red Scarf Farm of Beliang Primary School.

The Red Scarf Pharmaceutical Factory of Cangshui Street Primary School in Ningbo City was established by several Young Pioneers after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. They started from scratch, developed from nothing to something, and from small to large, and have now officially put into production. Their products include red mercury solution, Yituling, lubricating grease, bran oil ointment, medicinal wine, toothache medicine, and many others. After testing, all meet the specifications and are welcomed by the market. With excitement, I walked into their workshop. A group of Red Scarves were surrounding the experimental table, operating. They adopted the assembly line method, using the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity to continuously trial-produce new products, continuously design and improve technology. They are currently trial-producing bottle-washing machines and other equipment in order to gradually transition from manual operation to mechanical production. Their enthusiasm and practices have received the attention and support of the local Party committee.

The experiences of the Young Pioneers of Beliang Primary School of Yinggang People's Commune in the suburbs of Ningbo City in vigorously running Red Scarf farms and carrying out planting activities are also very moving. After studying the deeds of the great natural transformer Michurin, they launched a planting activity upsurge of "each team engaging in experiments, everyone participating." They studied the "Eight-Character Charter," delved into various agricultural technologies, overcame difficulties such as insufficient fertilizer, and studied the embryo grafting of corn and Nant No. 2 rice, achieving great results. The grafting of tomatoes and potatoes has also been successfully tested, and varieties such as solid-core pumpkins have greatly exceeded the original yields. These harvests have been praised by people. There is a poem as evidence:

The Red Scarf is redder than the sun, the children are true heroes.
Ambition does not depend on age, the production energy surpasses Wu Song.
Daring to think and dare to do experiments, growing crops shine red.
One millet plant has sixteen ears, each ear grows longer than a bamboo pole.
Rice and sorghum are difficult to distinguish, the ears are like horsetails and the grains are like eggs.
The solid-core pumpkin is like a small basket, the younger siblings cannot carry it.
Why is the yield so high? All thanks to the good leadership of the Party.

Cangshui Street Primary School and Beliang Primary School vigorously running Red Scarf factories and Red Scarf farms are two outstanding examples. Their experiences are worth promoting throughout the country.

In order to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, primary and secondary schools in Zhejiang Province and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have also successively established small factories and small farms. Taking Beijing as an example, according to incomplete statistics, by the end of 1959, there were 195 small factories and 1,667 small farms. The situation in Shanghai is particularly enthusiastic. In these small factories and small farms, children, through hands-on operation, not only learn to use both hands and brains and acquire technology, but also consolidate classroom knowledge, and exercise revolutionary will and perseverance, enabling them to personally experience the endless fun of invention and creation, and that striving for socialism and communism is the greatest happiness.

The mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being vigorously carried out across the country. Everyone is rushing forward with soaring enthusiasm, catching up with each other, and engaging in invention and creation. Let the children, under the leadership and education of the Party and the Youth League, also give full play to their greatest enthusiasm, courage, and wisdom, diligently study, thoroughly understand science and technology, and together with adults, rush to the forefront of production and construction, contribute their share to the great cause of building the motherland, and also lay a solid foundation for future communist construction.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct it, representatives.

    大办红领巾工厂、农场
    高士其代表的发言
    应当让孩子们从小起，就培养成爱科学、爱劳动的习惯，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，树立雄心壮志，作小科学家、小发明家主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和热烈拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并且为我国国民经济的高速度发展，社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    现在我就积极开展少年儿童的科学技术活动，大办红领巾工厂和红领巾农场的问题作一个简单的发言。
    这不是一个小问题。不要以为孩子们的事是小事，这问题关系着祖国的未来。少年儿童一代，是祖国雄厚的后备力量，是一支富有强大生命力的大军。
    孩子们今天是红领巾，明天就要当总路线的标兵、大跃进的红旗手、建设社会主义、共产主义的英雄人物。
    应当让孩子们从小起，就培养成爱科学、爱劳动的习惯，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，树立雄心壮志，作小科学家、小发明家，积极参加科技活动，攀登科学技术高峰，把祖国建设成更美丽、更繁荣、更幸福的人间天堂，地上乐园。
    在目前新的革命形势下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗光辉照耀下，开展少年儿童科学技术活动，大办红领巾工厂和红领巾农场，这个愿望和理想是完全可能实现的，而且有些地方已经胜利地进行了。
    这次我到宁波去视察，看到许多新鲜的东西，受到了极其深刻的教育、鼓舞和启发，其中我最感到兴趣的就是苍水街小学的红领巾制药厂和百梁小学的红领巾农场。
    宁波市苍水街小学的红领巾制药工厂，是在1958年大跃进以后，由几个少先队员所兴办的，他们是白手起家，从无到有，从小到大发展起来的，现在已经正式投入生产。他们的产品有红汞溶液、一涂灵、润滑脂、糠流油软膏、药酒、牙痛药水等多种，经过检验，都合乎规格，并且受到市场上的欢迎。我怀着兴奋的心情走进他们的车间，一群红领巾正围绕着试验桌进行操作，他们采取流水作业法，用苦干、实干和巧干的精神，不断地试制新产品、不断地设计和改进技术，他们正在试制刷瓶机等设备，以便逐步从手工操作过渡到机械生产。他们的干劲和作法，受到当地党委的重视和支持。
    宁波市郊区鄞钢人民公社百梁小学的少先队员们，大办红领巾农场，大搞种植活动的经过也非常动人。他们学习了伟大自然改造者米丘林公公的事迹之后，就掀起了一个“队队搞试验，人人都参加”的种植活动热潮；他们学习了“八字宪法”，钻研各种农业技术，克服了肥料不足等困难，他们研究了玉米和南特号水稻的胚接，取得了很大成绩，蕃茄和洋芋艿的嫁接也已试验成功，还有实心南瓜等品种，都大大的超过原有的产量。这些收获都得到人们的赞扬。有诗为证：
    红领巾比太阳红，少年儿童真英雄。
    志气不在年纪小，生产劲头胜武松。
    敢想敢做搞试验，种出庄稼映眼红。
    一株小米十六穗，穗穗长得过竹竿。
    水稻高粱难分辨，穗像马尾粒如蛋。
    实心南瓜像小箩，弟弟妹妹扛不动。
    为啥产量这样多，全靠党的好领导。
    苍水街小学和百梁小学大办红领巾工厂和红领巾农场，是两个出色的例子。他们的经验是值得向全国推广的。
    为了贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，浙江全省和全国各省市、自治区的中小学也都先后办起了小工厂和小农场，就拿北京市来说，据不完全的统计，到1959年底为止，已办有一百九十五个小工厂和一千六百六十七个小农场；上海方面这种情况尤为热烈。在这些小工厂和小农场里，孩子们通过亲手操作，不但学会了手脑并用、学到了技术，并且巩固了课堂知识，锻炼了革命意志和毅力，使他们亲身体会到创造发明乐趣无穷，为社会主义、共产主义而奋斗就是最大的幸福。
    现在以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正在全国各地轰轰烈烈的展开，人人都以冲天的干劲，你追我赶，进行发明创造。让孩子们在党、团的领导和教育下，也发挥出他们最大的热情、勇气和智慧，勤奋的学习，钻透科技关，和大人一道，奔赴生产建设的前线，为建设祖国的伟大事业，献出他们一份力量，也为未来的共产主义建设打下坚固的基础。以上发言是否有当，请代表们批评指正。
