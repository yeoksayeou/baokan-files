The "Ten Thousand Li Yunnan" of history was rumored to be a barren and frightening land full of miasmas and poisonous vapors. Zhuge Liang said in his "Chu Shi Biao" (Memorial on Dispatching the Army), "In May, we crossed the Lu River, penetrating deep into barren lands." The great Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi also wrote such lines: "I heard that Yunnan has the Lu River, when the pepper flowers fall, the miasma rises, the army wades through water like soup, before passing, two or three out of ten die." In reality, Yunnan is a beautiful and rich land of the motherland, possessing endless treasures, and its capital, Kunming, is a dazzling pearl on the splendid frontier.

Speaking of Kunming, people immediately think of a beautiful title—Spring City. In the past, some people used the phrase "Spring breeze arrives first in Colorful Yunnan" to describe it. In fact, the spring breeze is more than just "arriving first." More accurately, it should be "always present," spring in all four seasons. The myriad colors and thousands of reds, with flowers blooming all year round, are another characteristic of the Spring City, especially the camellias, which have been famous since ancient times, with the reputation of "the camellias of southern Yunnan are the best in the world."

Standing on the top of West Mountain, looking far into the distance, what "rushes into view" first is the "vast and boundless" Dianchi Lake, with its misty waves and scattered fishing sails. Shielding this mirror-like inner lake are the continuous and majestic famous mountains, known as "the East resembles a leaping divine steed, the West resembles a soaring spiritual phoenix, the North stretches windingly, and the South flies with pure white silk." Surrounded by the lake and mountains, there are now dotted factories, rows of buildings, towering chimneys, and crisscrossing roads, decorating this city magnificently. There are also many famous tourist attractions nearby, including Anning Hot Spring, known as the "Best Hot Spring in the World"; the magnificent scenery of West Mountain; the Grand View Pavilion with "fragrant rice fields all around, ten thousand acres of clear sand, hibiscus in the nine summers, and willows in the three springs"; and the Black Dragon Pool with ancient cypresses reaching the sky and the moon reflected in the pool.

Kunming not only has a naturally pleasant landscape, but also fertile land and rich resources, suitable for both industry and agriculture, and can be said to be uniquely blessed in developing its economy.

Kunming is also an ancient city with a long history. Starting from "Zhuang Qiao opening Dian" during the Warring States period, it was an important town in eastern Yunnan through the Han, Shu, Sui, and Tang dynasties, and has been the seat of Yunnan Prefecture since the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The East and West Temple Pagodas, which still stand in the city, are Tang Dynasty buildings; the Golden Temple, entirely made of copper, is a product of the 17th century. If you see the lifelike and vivid Five Hundred Arhats of Qiongzhu Temple, and the sheer cliffs and divine craftsmanship of the Dragon Gate stone carvings on West Mountain, you will be even more amazed at the high artistic talent of the working people.

Kunming was opened as a commercial port after the Sino-French Treaty in 1908, and with the invasion of imperialism, a new page in the revolutionary struggle of the Yunnan people was opened. At the beginning of the Republic, the national thief Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, and Yunnan took the lead in raising the banner of opposition to the imperial system. As early as 1926, the Chinese Communist Party established its organization in this frontier city, spreading Marxism-Leninism among the people of Yunnan. The people's musician Nie Er spent his student days here, initially receiving revolutionary inspiration. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, Kunming was once a center of the democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The famous "December 1st" movement took place here, and the blood of the democratic figures Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo was also shed on this land.

Before liberation, Kunming City had a weak production base and was economically backward. On the other hand, consumer and special industries serving the parasitic class were unusually developed. There is a statistic: At the eve of liberation, the total number of employees engaged in production in the city was only more than 7,000, while the number of people engaged in consumer operations and serving in special industries was more than 40,000.

Ten years of construction, especially after the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, have brought about tremendous and profound changes in Kunming City. The working class of Kunming, in order to change the backwardness of this city, carried out heroic and tenacious labor. Their heroic slogan is: "If there are no factories, build them ourselves; if there is no equipment, make it ourselves; if there are no raw materials, find them ourselves; if there are no techniques, learn them ourselves." The Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, known as the "Poor Stick Cooperative on the Industrial Front," started with a pair of pliers, and relying on "files and hard work," created precision pneumatic tools. The Xiaodali Chemical Factory, with only more than 170 people, used self-made indigenous machines, indigenous pots, and indigenous chicken coop furnaces, to produce dozens of new chemical products on the edge of the fields, on the banks of the dikes, and in the open air. In the wilderness, new factories and enterprises sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. At night, molten iron flowed, steel flowers danced, and the city was bathed in red light. In a mountain range, in a field, the roar of machines was deafening. It was truly: "Looking from afar, the lights illuminate the sky; looking up close, there are tens of thousands of heroes; the furnace fire soars ten thousand feet high; the heroes fight bravely in the steel city." Now, the city's steel production in a few days is far greater than the total steel production in the ten years before liberation.

Tremendous changes have also taken place in the suburbs. The establishment of the People's Communes has opened up broad prospects for the high-speed development of production and the construction of new rural areas. In the past few years, large-scale farmland water conservancy construction has been carried out. The water conservancy projects built in the two years since the winter of 1957 alone are 27 times more than all the water storage projects before liberation. The Panlong River upstream reservoir, completed in September last year, has a storage capacity equivalent to 26 times that of the Guchang Reservoir, which was known as the "first in the province" built during the Kuomintang rule. The original Guchang Reservoir has already hidden itself self-consciously in the vast new reservoir. Now, the suburbs are launching a high tide of agricultural technological transformation centered on mechanization. The call issued by the Municipal Party Committee to basically realize agricultural mechanization in the suburbs within three years has greatly inspired the farmers in the entire suburbs. With the strong support of all aspects of the city at the beginning of the year, five tractor stations were built in a short period of more than 20 days, and "farming without cattle" has been realized on about one-fourth of the arable land in the suburbs.

In people's memories, "Ten Thousand Li Yunnan" meant a long journey and isolated mountains. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which opened to traffic in 1910, contained so much of the Yunnan people's bitter blood and tears, and became a major artery for French imperialism to suck the blood and sweat of the Yunnan people. There are poems lamenting the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway:

"Double tracks carry thousands of lives,
How can the operation be entrusted to others?"
The quality of the roadbed was poor. Every rainy season, landslides and derailments occurred frequently. The Qitupo, which must be passed from Kunming to Yiliang, was known as the Gate of Hell. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the southern section of the railway was dismantled by the reactionary government and has not been repaired since. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has been completely renovated and the entire line has been repaired and opened to traffic. Now, the province has initially formed a highway, railway, and civil aviation network with Kunming as the starting point, connecting the province and abroad. The number of civil aviation routes has increased from one to eight, and direct flights can reach the heart of the motherland, Beijing, in a few hours. The ends of the earth are close at hand, and "Ten Thousand Li Yunnan" has become a historical term. In a few years, Kunming will become a connecting point for the Yunnan-Vietnam, Yunnan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guangxi, Chengdu-Kunming, and Neijiang-Kunming railway trunk lines, as well as several branch lines in the province, forming a transportation network extending in all directions. Now, a huge railway hub station is under construction.

The ever-changing appearance of the city can be compared with the innate natural scenery. Before liberation, Kunming, despite having the same mild climate and beautiful scenery as now, the reactionary rulers refused to let people feel it. A beautiful city was ruined with holes and scars. More than 80% of the city's houses were dilapidated, the streets in the urban area were narrow, bumpy, and uneven, and there were sewage pools and smelly gutters everywhere. These stains left over from the old city have now been wiped away like dust. The working people have not only restored the true colors of the "Spring City" with their own hands, but also dressed it up more beautifully. A large number of dilapidated houses and shantytowns have been demolished, and the newly built houses are close to the total construction area in the past century. Many workers and other working people who have lived in dark shantytowns for many years have moved into new homes with good air circulation and sufficient light.

Cultural, educational, and health undertakings are also thriving, and the spring is full of the garden. Before liberation, this city, known as the political, economic, and cultural center of the province, was also quite backward in culture. About 70% of the workers were illiterate, and in rural areas, except for a few landlords and rich peasants, there were very few literate people. In name, there were three so-called "institutions of higher learning" with simple equipment, with a total of just over 1,000 students. After liberation, many new schools were built one after another, and the original schools have been renovated and expanded, and their appearance has been completely renewed. Now, on average, one out of every five people in the city is a student, and there are currently seven institutions of higher learning. This year, eight more are planned to be built. The number of students in Yunnan University alone has greatly exceeded the number of college students in the entire city on the eve of liberation. Hundreds of thousands of workers and peasants have removed the label of "illiterate," and the task of eliminating illiteracy in urban and rural areas will be basically completed in the second quarter of this year. The health conditions in this city were very bad before liberation. Smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, relapsing fever, and malaria were prevalent all year round, regardless of the season. According to records, the scarlet fever epidemic in the city in 1921 lasted for a whole year, with half of the people falling ill and more than 20,000 deaths, accounting for one-fifth of the city's population at that time. It was truly "ten thousand households desolate, ghosts singing," and some "old Kunming" people still have lingering fears when they mention this event. Now, health conditions have fundamentally changed. The number of hospital beds in the city has increased more than tenfold compared with before liberation. On average, there is one hospital bed for every 150 people. A medical prevention network has been basically formed in urban and rural areas. Infectious diseases related to the four pests, such as plague and cholera, have disappeared, and several common local diseases have also greatly decreased.

While transforming the objective world, the people of Kunming are also constantly transforming their subjective world. Through the practice of revolution and construction, the mental outlook of the people has undergone profound changes. The seven urban People's Communes established in 1958 have played an even greater role in transforming the various evils, poisons, and backward phenomena left over from the old society and changing customs and habits. Now, a large number of housewives have been liberated from housework and have participated in street production and living service work, creating a new atmosphere of "everyone is busy with production, and every household has no idlers," and a new trend of loving labor, unity, and harmony has been formed.

Kunming, the Spring City on the splendid frontier of the motherland, the tremendous changes in the past ten years have given people a sense of "a new village appears when the willows are dark and the flowers are bright." Now, a heart-warming blueprint for construction has been unfolded before it. In a few years, Kunming will not only be built into an industrial city, but also into a garden city with green mountains, clear waters, and colorful flowers, becoming a famous tourist area, so that more people in the country can share the spring of Kunming.

    锦绣边疆春城好
    中共昆明市委第一书记　赵增益
    历史上的“万里云南”，在传闻中是一个充满着蛮烟瘴雨、荒凉可怕的不毛之地。诸葛亮在出师表中说：“五月渡泸，深入不毛”。唐代大诗人白居易也写过这样的诗句：“闻道云南有泸水，椒花落时瘴烟起，大军徒涉水如汤，未过十人二、三死”。实际上云南是祖国的一块美丽富饶、拥有无尽宝藏的大地，它的省会昆明，是绵绣边疆的一颗耀眼明珠。
    提起昆明，人们就联想到一个美丽的称号——春城。过去曾经有人用“春风先到彩云南”的词句来形容它，其实春风又何止是“先到”呢。更确切地说，应当是“常在”，是四季皆春。万紫千红，鲜花四时不雕，是春城的又一特色，尤以山茶花最为驰名，自古即有“滇南茶花之盛，甲于天下”的称誉。
    站在西山顶上，极目远眺，“奔来眼底”的首先是“喜茫茫空阔无边”的滇池，烟波浩翰，渔帆点点。屏藩着这个一明如镜的内湖的，有所谓“东骧神骏，西翥灵仪，北走蜿蜒，南翔缟素”等一排绵延不断、气势雄伟的名山。在湖山环抱里，现在又出现了星罗棋布的工厂，鳞次栉比的建筑群，高耸林立的烟囱，纵横交错的道路，把这个城市妆点得十分壮丽。附近还有不少的著名游览胜地，其中有被誉为“天下第一汤”的安宁温泉；有气象万千的西山景色；，有“四围香稻，万顷晴沙，九夏芙蓉，三春杨柳”的大观楼；有古柏参天、潭波映月的黑龙潭。
    昆明不仅有着天赋的宜人景色，而且土地肥沃、资源富饶，宜工宜农，在发展经济上同样可以说是得天独厚。
    昆明，也是个有着悠久历史的古城。从战国时“庄蹻开滇”起，历经汉、蜀、隋、唐都是滇东重镇，元、明、清以来即为云南府治。至今仍屹立市内的东、西寺塔，是唐代的建筑；全部铜结构的金殿，是十七世纪的产物。如果你看到维妙维肖、栩栩如生的筇竹寺五百罗汉，削壁千仞、鬼斧神工的西山龙门石刻，你更会惊叹劳动人民高度的艺术才能。
    昆明是1908年中法条约后被辟为商埠的，随着帝国主义的侵入，揭开了云南人民革命斗争史上新的一页。民初窃国大盗袁世凯称帝，云南首举反对帝制的义旗。早在1926年，这个边疆城市就建立了中国共产党的组织，在云南人民中传播马克思列宁主义思想。人民音乐家聂耳就是在这里度过了他的学生时代，初步接受了革命的熏陶。在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期，昆明曾经是蒋管区民主运动的一个中心，著名的“一二·一”运动就是发生在这里，民主人士李公朴、闻一多烈士的鲜血，也是洒在这块土地上。
    解放前的昆明市，一方面生产基础薄弱，经济上十分落后；另一方面，消费性和为寄生阶级服务的特殊行业异常发达。有这样一个统计数字：解放前夕全市从事生产的职工总人数不过七千多人，而从事消费性经营和在特殊行业服务的人员却有四万人之多。
    十年建设，特别是经过最近两年来连续大跃进，昆明市的面貌发生了巨大而深刻的变化。昆明的工人阶级，为了改变这个城市的落后面貌，进行了英勇顽强的劳动。他们的英雄口号是：“没有厂房自己盖，没有设备自己造，没有原料自己找，没有技术自己学”。被誉为
  “工业战线上的穷棒子社”的昆明风动工具厂，从一把老虎钳起家，就凭着“锉刀加干劲”，造出了精密的风动工具。只有一百七十多人的小厂大利化工厂，用自制的土机器、土锅、土鸡窝炉，在田边、堤沿上、露天下，生产出了几十种化工新产品。在荒山辟野中，新的工厂企业如雨后春笋，平地升起。入夜，铁水奔流，钢花飞舞，映红了半边天。在一片山峦上、田野里，机器轰鸣震耳，真是：“远看灯火照遍天，近看英雄万万千，炉火冲天高万丈，群英奋战钢铁城”。现在全市几天内钢的产量，就大大超过了解放前十年钢的总产量。
    在郊区也发生了翻天复地的大变化。人民公社的建立，给生产的高速度发展和新农村的建设开辟了广阔的前景。几年来进行了大规模的农田水利建设，仅1957年冬以来两年内兴修的水利工程，就比解放前全部蓄水量工程还多二十七倍。去年9月完工的盘龙江上游水库，蓄水量相当于国民党统治时期修建的号称“全省第一”的谷昌水库的二十六倍，原来的谷昌水库已经自惭形秽地躲藏在浩大的新水库中了。现在，郊区正在掀起一个以机械化为中心的农业技术改造高潮，市委发出的三年内基本实现郊区农业机械化的号召，在全郊区农民中发生了巨大的鼓舞作用。年初在城市各方面的大力支援下，短短的二十多天内就建起了五个拖拉机站，在占郊区耕地面积约四分之一的土地上已经实现了“耕田不用牛”。
    “万里云南”，在人们的记忆中就是路程迢迢，云山隔绝。1910年通车的滇越铁路，包含着云南人民多少辛酸的血泪，成为法帝国主义吸吮云南人民血汗的一条大动脉。时人有吊滇越铁路的诗句云：
  “双行铁轨千家命，怎奈经营付别人？”路基质量低劣，每逢雨季，塌方断路和翻车事件迭有发生，昆明至宜良必经的七凸坡被称为鬼门关。抗战期间，南段铁轨又被反动政府拆去，以后也没有修复。滇越铁路经过彻底整修，已全线修复通车，现在全省已经初步形成了以昆明为起点联系省内外的公路、铁路、民航网。民航线由一条增至八条，直达飞机几小时内就可以到达祖国的心脏北京，真是天涯近在咫尺，“万里云南”成为一个历史名词了。几年后的昆明将要成为滇越、滇黔、滇桂、成昆、内昆等铁路干线及省内几条支线的连接点，形成一个四通八达的交通网。现在，一个规模巨大的铁路枢纽站正在加紧建设。
    日新月异的城市外貌的变化，足可以和天赋的自然景色交相辉映。解放前的昆明，尽管和现在一样也是气候温和，风光绮丽，可是反动统治者却不肯让人们有这种感受，一个美好的城市被糟踏得千疮百孔、残破不堪。全市破旧房屋占80％以上，市区街道狭窄，坎坷不平，遍处是污水坛、臭阴沟。这些旧城市遗留下来的污渍，现在都像灰尘一样被拭去了。劳动人民用自己的双手，不仅恢复了“春城”的本色，而且把它打扮得更加美丽。大量的破旧房屋和棚户区被拆除了，新建房屋接近百年来建筑面积的总和，许多长年居住在阴暗的棚户中的工人及其他劳动人民搬入了空气流通、光线充足的新居。
    文化教育卫生事业也是万紫千红，春色满园。解放前这个号称全省政治经济文化中心的城市，文化也是相当落后的，工人中70％左右都是文盲，农村除少数地主富农外，识字的人更是寥寥无几。名义上虽然有三所设备简陋的所谓“高等学府”，全部学生不过一千多人。解放后陆续新建了许多学校，原有学校经过扩建改建，面目焕然一新。现在全市平均每五个人中就有一个在校学生，高等学校现有七所，今年还准备再建八所，仅云南大学一校的学生就大大超过了解放前夕全市大学生人数。有几十万工农群众摘掉了“文盲”的帽子，今年二季度即可基本上全部完成城乡扫盲任务。解放前这个城市的卫生状况十分糟糕，天花、霍乱、伤寒、回归热、疟疾不分季节，终年流行。根据记载，1921年猩红热在全市传染曾延续一年之久，有一半人发病，死亡二万余人，占当时城市人口的五分之一，真是“万户萧疎鬼唱歌”，一些“老昆明”提起这件事来至今还有余悸。现在，卫生状况已经根本改观，全市拥有的病床数比解放前增加了十多倍，平均每一百五十人中就有一张病床，城乡都基本上形成了一个医疗预防网，与四害有关的传染病鼠疫、霍乱等已绝迹，几种地方性多发病也大大下降。
    昆明市的人民在改造客观世界的同时，还不断地在改造着自己的主观世界。通过革命和建设的实践，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。1958年建立起来的七个城市人民公社，在改变旧社会遗留下来的种种邪恶、污毒的东西和一切落后现象上，更起到了移风易俗的作用。现在，大批家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了街道生产和生活服务工作，出现了一个“人人忙生产，户户无闲人”的新气象，热爱劳动、团结和睦的新风尚已经形成。
    昆明，祖国锦绣边疆的春城，十年来的巨变，使人大有“柳暗花明又一村”之感。现在一幅令人心花怒放的建设蓝图，又在它的面前展开了。几年后的昆明，不仅将要建设成为一个工业城市，而且还要建设成为一个无山不绿、有水皆清、万紫千红的花园城市，成为一个著名的游览区，让国内有更多的人来分享昆明的春天。
