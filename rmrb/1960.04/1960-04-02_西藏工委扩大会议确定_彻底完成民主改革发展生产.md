    Tibet Work Committee Enlarged Meeting Determines to Thoroughly Complete Democratic Reform and Develop Production
    (Our Dispatch) The current situation in Tibet is very good. The democratic reform movement has achieved significant victories, and the vast rural areas that have completed democratic reform are vigorously carrying out a patriotic production increase movement centered on mutual production assistance. This is the analysis of the current situation in Tibet made by the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at an enlarged meeting of the Work Committee held from the 12th to the 22nd of this month. This meeting was a meeting to review and summarize the democratic reform work of the past year and to arrange various tasks for the reform areas this year. The meeting heard the "Preliminary Summary of Democratic Reform and Work Arrangements in the Reform Areas" report by Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the summary report by Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, entitled "Continue to Boost Revolutionary Drive, Advance Victoriously, and Strive to Thoroughly Complete Democratic Reform and Vigorously Develop Agricultural and Livestock Production." More than 20 responsible comrades from various sub-work committees, county committees, and district committees spoke at the meeting.
    The meeting, in correctly analyzing the current situation in Tibet, held that: After quelling the rebellion last year, and after nearly a year of democratic reform, the dark, reactionary, cruel, and barbarous rule of the feudal serf system has been destroyed, the superiority of slaves and poor serfs has been established, and millions of serfs have stood up. A total of 78 counties (including six districts under the jurisdiction of cities equivalent to counties) in the entire region. As of the end of February, in agricultural areas, 57 counties with a population of approximately 790,000 have comprehensively launched the democratic reform movement. Among them, 49 counties with a population of approximately 690,000 have completed the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement (opposing rebellion, opposing the Ula corvée system, opposing personal dependence, and reducing rent and interest). Among the 49 counties that have completed the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement, 47 counties with a population of approximately 610,000 have completed land distribution. This means that most agricultural areas have now completed democratic reform. In addition, in pastoral areas, 12 counties with a population of approximately 75,000 have launched the "Three Antis" and "Two Benefits" movement (benefit both herdsmen and herd owners), of which approximately 30,000 people have completed the "Three Antis" and "Two Benefits" movement. In areas where the democratic reform movement has been launched, farmers' associations at the county, district, and township levels have been generally established, and people's political power at all levels has been established. According to statistics from Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Qamdo, and Xigaze Prefectures (cities) alone, more than 1,080 township-level farmers' associations have been established. In the struggle for democratic reform, a large number of activists emerged, a large number of grassroots cadres grew, and the class consciousness of the broad masses was significantly improved. The masses generally realized that the three major manorial lords and the feudal serf system were the root cause of the oppression and enslavement of the working people and all suffering. They recognized that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao were the great saviors of the working people, and at the same time, they realized their own strength and believed that they could completely liberate themselves. In the countryside, where manorial lords had the power of life and death and cruel rule for thousands of years, the emancipated serfs are now masters of their own affairs, realizing the slogan "All power belongs to the farmers' association."
    The meeting believed that the major victory of the democratic reform movement in a short period of time was primarily due to the resolute implementation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of dividing the democratic reform into two steps: "Three Antis and Two Reductions" and land distribution. It was also due to the resolute implementation of the Party's policies such as classifying classes based on components such as manorial lords, middle serfs, poor serfs, and slaves, and implementing redemption of the means of production of upper-level elements who did not participate in the rebellion. It also involved conscientiously implementing the Party's class line and mass line, uniting all patriotic and progressive upper-level people, and in the movement, cadres and work teams going to the countryside to participate in the reform, visiting the poor and asking about their sufferings, and implementing "Three Togethernesses and One Exchange" with the masses (eating, living, and working with the masses, and exchanging hearts with the masses), fully mobilizing the masses to carry out the movement of digging up the roots of poverty and pouring out bitterness, and helping the masses to liberate themselves. Secondly, it resolutely cracked down on the sabotage activities of rebellion and counter-revolution, removed the feudal lid, and educated the broad masses. Thirdly, during the democratic reform movement, the Party's principles, policies, and working methods of the mass line were used to arm the Tibetan and Han cadres participating in the democratic reform, and to improve the political level of the vast number of rural cadres.
    After analyzing the current political situation, the meeting pointed out that: With the destruction of the feudal serf system and the change of production relations, social productivity in Tibet has been greatly liberated, and the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly high. The broad masses have launched a patriotic production increase movement centered on mutual production assistance with high spirits and vitality. This is the great wisdom and creation of the emancipated farmers in Tibet. Since last winter and this spring, farmers in various places have made outstanding achievements in accumulating fertilizer, plowing the land, repairing water conservancy facilities, and reforming agricultural tools. The masses said: People have been emancipated, and the land must also be emancipated. In production, farmers actively participate in agricultural production mutual aid groups, which are the sprouts of socialism. Mutual aid groups have developed extremely rapidly and vigorously in various places. According to statistics from Shannan Prefecture alone, more than 2,000 mutual aid groups have been organized, with farmers participating accounting for 90% of the total number of farmers. Farmers have also carried out large-scale comparisons, competitions, and collaborations in production, fully demonstrating their new mental outlook and new social customs after being emancipated.
    The meeting pointed out that: The Party has made great achievements in leading democratic reform and developing production in the past year, but we must not be satisfied with this and stagnate. Democratic reform is only the first step in the entire revolutionary process in Tibet, and the first step has not yet been completed, and the democratic revolution has not yet been thoroughly completed. All cadres must prevent and overcome right-leaning paralysis, complacency, and self-satisfaction. They must constantly arm themselves with Marxist theory of class struggle, and they must recognize that the class struggle in the future will still be very sharp and complex. They must recognize the long-term and complex nature of class struggle.
    All cadres must also arm themselves with the Marxist theory of continuous revolution, and learn to grasp with both hands, one hand grasping today and the other grasping tomorrow. The main tasks for this year are: On the one hand, we must continue to deeply mobilize the masses, completely complete the democratic reform, and conduct a comprehensive reform review to carry out the democratic revolution thoroughly. On the other hand, in areas where democratic reform has been completed, we must adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously develop production, strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, vigorously develop, rectify, and improve production mutual aid groups, and carry out a broad socialist education movement for farmers to lay a good foundation for future socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    This meeting was held very timely. After this meeting, the ideological understanding of cadres was further improved, and the morale of cadres was boosted. This meeting laid a good ideological foundation for thoroughly completing the democratic reform in Tibet, striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in Tibet this year, and educating farmers to take the socialist road.

    西藏工委扩大会议确定
    彻底完成民主改革发展生产
    本报讯　西藏当前的形势很好，民主改革运动已经取得重大胜利，完成民主改革的广大农村正在蓬勃开展以生产互助为中心的爱国丰产运动。这是中共西藏工委在本月12日至22日召开的工委扩大会议上，对西藏当前形势的分析。这次会议是检查总结将近一年来民主改革工作和安排改革地区今年各项工作的一次会议。会议听取了中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武的“关于民主改革的初步总结和改革地区的工作安排的报告”和中共西藏工委副书记周仁山的题为“继续鼓足革命干劲，乘胜前进，为彻底完成民主改革，大力发展农牧业生产而奋斗”的总结报告。各分工委、县委、区委负责同志二十多人在大会上作了发言。
    会议在正确分析西藏当前的形势时认为：去年平息叛乱后，经过将近一年来的民主改革，黑暗、反动、残酷、野蛮的封建农奴制度的统治已被摧毁，奴隶和贫苦农奴的优势已经树立起来，百万农奴已经站了起来，全区共计七十八个县（包括六个相当县级的市辖区）。截至2月底的统计，在农业区已有五十七个县约七十九万人口的地区，全面开展了民主改革运动。其中四十九个县约六十九万人口的地区，已经完成了“三反双减”（反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度，反对人身依附和减租减息）运动，在完成了“三反双减”运动的四十九个县中，有四十七个县约六十一万人口的地区，已经完成了土地分配。这就是说，目前大部分农业地区已经完成了民主改革。另外，在牧业区也有十二个县约七万五千人口的地区开展了“三反”和“两利”（牧工牧主两利）运动，其中约有三万人口的地区完成了“三反”和“两利”运动。已经开展民主改革运动的地区，普遍成立了县、区、乡农民协会，建立了各级人民政权。仅据拉萨、山南、林芝、昌都、日喀则五个专区（市）统计，已成立乡一级农民协会一千零八十多个。在民主改革斗争中出现了大批积极分子，生长了大批基层干部，广大群众的阶级觉悟有了显著提高。群众普遍认识到三大领主和封建农奴制度是劳动人民受压迫受奴役和一切痛苦的根源，认识到了共产党、毛主席是劳动人民的大救星，同时也认识到了自己的力量，相信自己能够彻底解放自己。千百年来农奴主生杀予夺残酷统治的农村，现在翻身农奴当家作主，实现了“一切权利归农会”的口号。
    在短短时间内，民主改革运动所以能够取得重大胜利，会议认为首先是由于坚决执行了党中央、毛主席所确定的民主改革分为“三反双减”和分配土地的两步走的方针，坚决执行了党的以农奴主、中等农奴、贫苦农奴和奴隶等成分划阶级、对未参加叛乱的上层分子的生产资料实行赎买等政策，认真贯彻了党的阶级路线和群众路线，团结一切爱国进步的上层人士，在运动中干部组织工作队下乡参加改革，访贫问苦，与群众实行“三同一交”（与群众同吃同住同劳动，与群众交心），充分发动群众进行了挖穷根吐苦水的诉苦运动，帮助群众自己解放了自己。其次是坚决打击了叛乱和反革命的破坏活动，揭掉了封建盖子，教育了广大群众。再次是在民主改革运动中经常以党的方针、政策和群众路线的工作方法，武装了参加民主改革的藏、汉族干部，提高了广大农村干部的政治水平。
    会议在分析了当前的政治形势后指出：随着封建农奴制度的被摧毁和生产关系的改变，西藏社会生产力大大解放，农民生产热情空前高涨，意气昂扬焕发，广大群众已经掀起了一个以生产互助为中心的爱国丰产运动，这是西藏翻身农民的伟大智慧和创造。去冬今春以来，各地农民已在积肥、翻地、整修水利、改革农具等方面做出了出色的成绩。群众说：人翻身了，地也要翻身。在生产中，农民积极参加社会主义萌芽的农业生产互助组，互助组在各地发展得极为迅速、猛烈。仅据山南专区统计就已组织了两千多个互助组，入组农户占总农户的90％。农民在生产中还开展了大评比，大竞赛，大协作，充分显示出了他们翻身后新的精神面貌和社会新风尚。
    会议指出：一年来党在领导民主改革和发展生产方面取得了巨大成就，但绝不能以此为满足，停滞不前，民主改革只是西藏整个革命过程中的第一步，第一步还未走完，民主革命还未彻底完成。全体干部必须防止和克服右倾麻痹、骄傲自满的思想倾向，必须以马克思主义的阶级斗争理论不断武装自己，必须认识到今后的阶级斗争仍然是很尖锐和复杂的，必须认识到阶级斗争的长期性和复杂性。
    全体干部还必须用马克思主义的不断革命理论把自己武装起来，要学会两手抓，一手抓今天，一手抓明天。今年的主要任务是：一方面，要继续深入发动群众，全部完成民主改革，并进行一次全面的改革复查工作，把民主革命彻底进行到底，一方面在完成民主改革的地区，坚持政治挂帅，大力发展生产，力争今年农业生产大丰收，大力发展和整顿提高生产互助组，对农民开展一次广泛的社会主义教育运动，为将来的社会主义改造和社会主义建设打好基础。
    这次会议开得非常及时。经过这次会议，更加提高了干部的思想认识，鼓舞了干部的斗志。这次会议为彻底完成西藏的民主改革，为争取西藏今年农业大丰收、教育农民走社会主义道路，奠定了良好的思想基础。　（赵慎应）
