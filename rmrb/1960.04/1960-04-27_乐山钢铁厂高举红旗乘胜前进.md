Leshan Steel Plant in Sichuan Province, in developing and improving its small blast furnace clusters, closely integrates current production with a comprehensive and systematic technical transformation of the weak links in production, taking the blast furnace as the leader and high blast, high temperature, and high pressure as the guiding principles. This has resulted in each of the plant's dozen small blast furnaces being transformed into a high-yielding unit, achieving a substantial, large-scale, and sustained high output. By the end of March, compared to January of this year, the plant's average utilization coefficient had increased from 1.26 to 2.5, the coke ratio had decreased from 1.27 to 0.71, the sulfur content had decreased from 0.2 to 0.073, and the cost per ton of pig iron had decreased to 140 yuan. All major technical and economic indicators have caught up with and exceeded the level of large enterprises, establishing a red flag of high yield, high quality, low consumption, low cost, and comprehensive high-speed leap forward for the province's small iron smelting clusters.
