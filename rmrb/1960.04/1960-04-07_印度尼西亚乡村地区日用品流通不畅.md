Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 5th: The Indonesian "Republic" newspaper today published a statement by Rumambi, Secretary of the National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, stating that the purchasing power of the people in Indonesian rural areas has declined to such an extent that the circulation of daily necessities in rural areas has become sluggish. He said that one reason for the decline in purchasing power in Indonesian rural areas is that the prices of daily necessities are too high, exceeding the purchasing power of the people. Another reason is the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits foreign small retailers.

Rumambi said that after the number of foreign retailers decreased, other distributors, such as domestic retailers, have not been able to replace them. This situation cannot but cause the stagnation of the circulation of daily necessities. He pointed out that prohibiting foreign retailers in rural areas is unnecessary because they do not endanger the Indonesian national economy, but are beneficial to the Indonesian people.

    印度尼西亚乡村地区日用品流通不畅
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚“共和国报”今天发表的全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会书记伦普兰比的一项声明说，印度尼西亚乡村地区人民的购买力已下降到这种程度，以致乡村地区的日用必需品发生了流通不畅的现象。他说，印度尼西亚乡村地区人民购买力下降的一个原因是，日用品价格太高，高于人民的购买力，另一个原因是，由于实施了有关的禁止外国小零售商的第十号总统法令。
    伦普兰比说，在外国零售商人数减少以后，其他的分配者如本国零售商等还没有能够替代他们。这种情况不能不引起日用必需品流通停滞的现象。他指出，禁止乡村地区的外国零售商是不必要的，因为他们并不危及印度尼西亚的国民经济，而是有利于印度尼西亚人民。
