The first spring of the 1960s sees a vibrant scene emerging in China. Responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party for everyone to be bold in thought and action, the working people are launching a new and great revolution on the fronts of production, science, and culture. They have created earth-shaking achievements, pushing our country a big step further towards modernization, advancement, and prosperity in all aspects. The Chinese people have once again proven that they are the masters of their own destiny.

The basic characteristics of our current situation are:

(1) A high tide of technological innovation and revolution is emerging in the entire industry, basic construction, transportation, commerce, all institutions, service industries, and welfare undertakings;

(2) In the countryside, along with vigorously engaging in agricultural production, a huge upsurge of water conservancy construction and other work to tame nature has also been launched;

(3) A mass cultural revolution has emerged;

(4) The people have a high degree of political awareness.

All these factors are closely linked and interact with each other, and together they constitute the picture of our national socialist construction. Particularly prominent is the technological revolution being carried out by our working class. This movement today has become a driving force for China's progress.

Technological innovation and technological revolution are the solutions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party to address a crucial contradiction in our society, which is the contradiction between the socialist relations of production established by our people and the sometimes very primitive productive forces and often outdated labor methods, labor organization, and production management. Indeed, the development of production relations depends on the development of the means of production. However, production relations, in turn, also affect the development of the means of production and have a counter-effect on it, which can accelerate or delay it. In today's China, we see an example of how advanced production relations are promoting huge and historic changes in social productive forces.

China is building thousands of large-scale modern factories, some of which are the largest and most technologically advanced in the world. While the production of these factories is very impressive, there are also things that are of great significance to our national economy, and that is the hundreds of thousands of small street factories and medium-sized factories. Many of these factories have been built recently or have developed from the original handicraft foundation. Not long ago, the vast majority of the products of these factories were still manufactured by inefficient manual labor organized in an old way.

These factories have continuously carried out technological innovation movements in the past, thus making outstanding contributions to our growing economy. However, as long as the technical level of these factories is improved, they can obviously greatly increase production while reducing the consumption of manpower and raw materials. To keep them in this backward state would be to allow the contradiction between them and the socialist relations of production to develop, and to allow this contradiction to become a stumbling block to further rapid socialist construction.

Therefore, the conditions for China to fully transform from backward to advanced are already ripe. This task is an inevitable continuation of the development of the situation after the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to achieve liberation in 1949.

Liberation placed the country in the hands of the working class, who are firmly allied with their peasant brothers, and together they constitute the vast majority of the people. This made it possible to rapidly restore the national economy and formulate the first Five-Year Plan. The economic strength of the people's state grew very rapidly, thereby creating the basis for the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. While these economic advances were being made, various movements were launched on the political and ideological fronts. The purpose of these movements was to change the superstructure of society to adapt it to the economic base, to establish comradely relations between people, and to eliminate the feudal and bourgeois ideas left over from the old society.

The socialist revolution achieved one victory after another. The productive forces and the enthusiasm of the working people were also unprecedentedly liberated. In this situation, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and Chairman Mao Zedong brilliantly formulated a whole set of policies to guide us towards this goal.

The working people and intellectuals rose up in response with great enthusiasm, and thus the second Five-Year Plan achieved rapid progress from the very beginning. The main targets of the second Five-Year Plan were completed three years ahead of schedule in 1959, thereby creating the objective conditions for further development. The current technological innovation and technological revolution movement is precisely this further development. It is the product of the miracles on the production front in 1958-1959. It is the development of the idea of developing the national economy at a continuously leaping speed.

This movement has swept across the country like a storm. At first, it was only innovations in individual working methods, production processes, and tools. But once the working people understood the revolutionary significance of technical improvement, nothing could stop them. Dispersed individual reforms quickly turned into a large-scale offensive against the existing production and labor organization, against all operating methods, machines, and tools, in order to modernize the entire industry, from beginning to end, and the entire production process and raise it a step. Its goal is first to free workers from manual labor to reduce the number of workers, save raw materials, and at the same time increase production.

Chinese mythology tells the story of the Monkey King Sun Wukong making havoc in the heavenly palace, but even this Monkey King pales in comparison to the magnificent momentum of this movement to thoroughly transform entire workshops and factories. Slow, laborious methods with centuries of history have disappeared almost overnight. Mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation have become the demand of the whole people. Now before us appears a mass revolutionary movement with a high degree of political awareness, which is gradually realizing the technological transformation of all departments of the national economy in a planned and leadership manner, one upsurge after another.

In every production and service department, from the largest modern factory to the street workshop, the enthusiastic atmosphere of the movement can be felt everywhere. The local but very scientific methods created by the workers based on their rich experience have played a major role. They are either used alone or in combination with the world's latest technology and science. In many cases, completely new methods and technologies have been created.

This has once again led to a rapid increase in production, improved quality and precision, the successful trial production of countless new products, new sources of raw materials have been found, and the huge potential for further savings has been discovered. The entire production technology and labor organization have developed more broadly and deeply than in the great leap forward of 1958-1959.

What does the above illustrate? This shows that everyone is using their own hands and brains to engage in invention and innovation, eradicate old production methods and create new production methods, and comprehensively eliminate the backwardness of Chinese industry. Now no one can doubt that this mass action is one of the guarantees for realizing the slogan put forward by the Chinese Communist Party of achieving a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

With the creative spirit of the working class as a model, the movement has naturally developed to the countryside. Thoroughly transforming our agriculture is the Communist Party's long-term plan. The people's communes have already established many small and medium-sized industries. In addition to a large number of machines being sent from the cities, a movement to mechanize and semi-mechanize agricultural construction and farming, mainly using local methods and local materials, is being widely carried out in the countryside. At the same time, large numbers of technicians, engineers, and workers are going to the countryside to help the communes engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, and to help train a technical contingent of peasants, thereby further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. This has revolutionary significance for our countryside. It is further promoting the agricultural and industrial production of the communes. With this new impetus, the communes will once again prove their great superiority as the basic units for building socialism in our country.

Such a wave of technological innovation and technological revolution sweeping everything can only appear in a socialist society. The working people do not have to fear that large-scale construction and improvements in the production process will make anyone a "superfluous person" or unemployed, as they do under the capitalist system. No, in our country, construction is courageously led by the workers themselves! The means of production are in their own hands, and there is no phenomenon of man exploiting man. Improving efficiency will only transfer workers to other urgent jobs, and will only bring a better life and more opportunities for further study and improvement to all the Chinese people.

Technological innovation and technological revolution are having a profound impact on our country's economic, political, and cultural life. On the basis of a comprehensive improvement in production technology, labor productivity is rapidly increasing, capital accumulation is accelerating, and the means of production are being continuously and rapidly developed. All this will accelerate socialist construction and greatly change the face of our country.

People are the primary driving force of all progress. It is people who have carried out the revolution that has made it possible to increase the means of production, and in the process, they have been spiritually liberated. It is the socialist revolution led by the proletariat that has unprecedentedly liberated the economy and culture. Under the socialist system, social productive forces are pushed from one leap forward to another, thereby promoting the gradual change of production relations and the progress of people's thinking. In the endless struggle to protect the new society, conquer nature, and continuously improve living standards, people transform the environment and transform themselves.

This is precisely the situation of our current technological innovation and technological revolution. It is not only a great technological revolutionary movement but also a great revolutionary movement in production and thought. New things can only grow through the struggle with old things. New ways in production and labor organization are produced from past forms. Right-leaning conservative thinking tolerates the old and outdated things, causing everything to stagnate, and therefore often becomes a fetter preventing the leaping development of socialism. The current movement is a declaration of war against this kind of thinking. The Chinese working people have clearly shown that they fully understand the significance of this ideological struggle. In just a few days, they have defeated right-leaning thinking in this regard with practical actions. In this way, they have shown that they are determined to not only achieve "more, faster" but also "better, more economical" in the cause of building socialism.

People have drawn two important lessons in thought from this revolutionary storm: first, a person's viewpoint determines how far and how fast he can advance the means of production, life, and the entire society. Second, the collective way of life and struggle is undoubtedly the most effective. These Marxist-Leninist principles have been further consolidated and more deeply understood in the minds of the working people. The communist style shown by people in their work and in their comradely relations has been developed to a new height. Today, in our country, people consider problems not with "I" as the center, but with our large collective of 650 million people as the center.

There are too many moving stories of workers and peasants working day and night, selflessly devoting themselves to technological innovation and technological revolution. They support each other, refuse to give up, and sometimes conduct hundreds of experiments before finally succeeding. We now have many poems, dramas, and movies based on real people and real events, reflecting this communist effort for the common cause of our country's progress. However, although writers and artists go deep into the scene to collect materials, they still encounter great difficulties. They find that the situation is developing so fast, the stories are so numerous, and the content is so rich and colorful that it is difficult for them to keep up with the development of actual life and to vividly depict it.

Inspired by the enthusiasm and collectivist spirit of the working people, and in the face of new and huge needs, scientific and educational workers are fighting alongside the people of the whole country. They have accelerated the pace of cultural revolution and scientific research to meet the masses' unlimited desire for knowledge and to raise science to the level needed to solve major problems in production.

The communist slogan of "leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others" has taken root in our society. The advanced are helping the backward, so that they also become advanced, and everyone becomes more advanced together. People are doing everything possible to prevent anyone from "falling behind." Administrative leaders, workers, and technicians cooperate. Individuals help individuals, workshops help workshops, and factories help factories. One industry supports another industry, and one city or region supports another city or region. The communist spirit and work style are becoming a material force. They have become a huge driving force for promoting socialist construction. The communist spirit has appeared before the realization of communism. It has become a source of unlimited power, making the bright future closer to reality day by day.

The same spirit also prompted the establishment of people's communes, which were mainly established in rural areas in the past, in cities across the country. This is a great revolutionary mass movement of great historical significance, which rationally organizes all aspects of life, promotes the rapid development of productive forces, and increases the welfare of urban residents. It will completely change the face of urban life. According to rural experience and urban pilot experience, we can see that urban communes will expand production and reorganize social life, thereby liberating more labor force. In particular, urban people's communes will liberate women who are bound by many trivial household chores in the family circle, and further educate the people with the communist spirit of collectivism. This newborn thing has been warmly welcomed throughout the country. Our people regard it as a new and inspiring development, another reflection of the revolutionary situation in all aspects of our lives, and another inspiring force for promoting our comprehensive progress.

The remarkable progress that the Chinese people are currently making marks another victory for the Party's general line of building socialism, the Party's policy of continuing the great leap forward, and the people's communes. All this embodies the Party's mass line. Their success shows that the people trust and trust the Party more, resolutely follow the Party, and go wherever the Party points.

The progress of our country is built on the foundation of the Party's correct policies, and these policies embody the great Marxist-Leninist truth that Chairman Mao Zedong and the Party have applied to China's specific practice. This was the case during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, and it is also the case in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Chairman Mao and the Party have formulated China's road to continuous victory, which enriches the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist thought.

Under the leadership of the Party, our people have continuously improved their understanding of the world and its laws of change, and have deepened their understanding of the development of the revolution from one stage to another without interruption. The Chinese people are better armed ideologically, they have a high degree of political awareness and full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and are ready to meet the arrival of each new revolutionary situation. The Party maintains this revolutionary spirit that never slackens, and uses it to stimulate the creative spirit of our people. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has become a constantly functioning force driving China's continuous economic, political and cultural revolution.

Bourgeois historians and propagandists attempt to scare people with the word "revolution." They attempt to erase this word from their history and basic documents, as if this word itself can magically conjure up an objective environment that demands a clean break with the past, with the chaos of the past, and with the countless sufferings suffered by the vast working people in the past. But those who dare to face reality will not be frightened by the word revolution and the prospect of revolution. They realize how correct Marx was when he said that "revolution is the locomotive of history."

The Chinese people are deeply convinced of this. The revolution has led us to a bright present and gives us a bright future. It has enabled China to stand up and, as a country with a long history and rich culture, make its due contribution to human progress and world peace. Now this has become part of the east wind overwhelming the west wind, which creates favorable conditions for defending peace against the conspiracies of the imperialists and makes peaceful coexistence between countries possible.

The Chinese working class is proud of the revolution that it has already carried out, and is also proud of the revolution it is carrying out today to build our country into a prosperous and strong country with modern industry, agriculture, science, and culture. At the same time, our people are humble, because we know that there are still many things we must do and many things we must learn.

We are united with the working people in all parts of the world. We regard the victories we have already achieved as part of the broad movement of the people of the world to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism. The symbol of this movement is the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We are deeply convinced that this movement will achieve final victory.

    一场翻天复地的新的革命
    宋庆龄
    六十年代的第一个春天，在中国出现了一片生气蓬勃的景象。劳动人民响应中国共产党要大家敢想敢做的号召，在生产、科学和文化战线上，掀起了一场新的伟大的革命。他们创造了翻天复地的业迹，把我国在一切方面朝着现代化、先进和繁荣的方向又推进了一大步。中国人民再一次证明他们是自己的命运的主宰。
    我们目前的形势的基本特点是：
    （一）在整个工业、基本建设、交通运输、商业、所有机关、服务性行业和福利事业中出现了一个技术革新和技术革命的高潮；
    （二）在农村中，在大搞农业生产的同时，也掀起了兴修水利和进行其他驯服自然的工作的巨大热潮；
    （三）出现了一个群众性的文化革命；
    （四）人民有高度的政治觉悟。
    所有这些因素都是紧密地联系着和互相发生作用的，它们在一起构成了我们全国进行社会主义建设的图景。其中非常突出的是我国工人阶级正在进行的技术革命。这个运动在今天形成了一股推动我国前进的动力。
    技术革新和技术革命是中国共产党提出的解决我们社会中的一个极关重要的矛盾的办法，这个矛盾就是我国人民建立的社会主义的生产关系与有时候很原始的生产力和往往是过时的劳动方法、劳动组织和生产管理之间的矛盾。的确，生产关系的发展取决于生产资料的发展。然而，生产关系反过来也影响生产资料的发展，并对它起反作用，可以加速它或推迟它。在今天的中国，我们看到了先进的生产关系如何促使社会生产力发生巨大的和历史性的变化的一个实例。
    中国正在兴办数以千计的大规模的现代化的工厂，其中有些是世界上最大的和技术上最先进的。虽然这些工厂的生产是非常吸引人的，然而还有一些东西也对我国的国民经济具有重大的意义，这就是数以十万计的小的街道工厂和中等规模的工厂。这些工厂中有许多都是兴建不久或是从原来手工业的底子上发展起来的。不久以前，这些工厂的绝大部分产品还是以陈旧的方式组织起来的效率很低的手工劳动制造的。
    这些工厂先前已经不断开展技术革新运动，从而对我国的日益增长的经济作出了卓越的贡献。但是，只要这些工厂的技术水平一提高，它们显然可以在减少人力和原料的消耗的情况下大大增产。让它们保持这种落后状态，就是听任它们同社会主义生产关系之间的矛盾发展，听任这种矛盾发展成为进一步迅速建设社会主义的绊脚石。
    因此，我国全力变落后为先进的条件已经成熟。这个任务是在1949年中国共产党领导全国人民得到解放以后的局势发展的必然继续。
    解放使国家掌握在工人阶级手里，工人阶级牢固地同农民弟兄们结成联盟，他们在一起构成了人民的绝大多数。这使迅速恢复国民经济和制订第一个五年计划成为可能。人民国家的经济力量增长得非常快，从而为农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造创造了基础。在经济方面取得这些进展的同时，开展了政治和思想战线上的各种运动。这些运动的目的是：改变社会的上层建筑，使之适应经济基础，建立人与人之间的同志般的关系，清除旧社会遗留下来的封建和资产阶级思想。
    社会主义革命取得了一个又一个的胜利。生产力和劳动人民的积极性也随之得到了空前的解放。在这种情况下，中国共产党提出了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，毛泽东主席英明地制订了一整套的政策，引导我们走向这个目标。
    劳动人民和知识分子劲头十足地起而响应，于是第二个五年计划一开始就获得了飞跃的进展。第二个五年计划的主要指标已在1959年提前三年完成，从而创造了要求进一步发展的客观条件。目前的技术革新和技术革命运动正是这种进一步的发展。它是1958—1959年的生产战线上的奇迹的产物。它是从以不断跃进的速度来发展国民经济的思想的发展。
    这个运动已经风起云涌地席卷全国。起初它只是在个别工作方法、生产过程和工具方面的革新。但是一旦劳动人民懂得了技术改进的革命意义，就没有任何东西可以阻挡他们。分散的个别的改革很快变成了对现有的生产和劳动组织，对一切操作方法、机器和工具的大规模进攻，以便把整个行业的、从头到尾的、整个生产过程成为现代化并且提高一步。它的目标首先是使工人摆脱手工劳动以减少工人人数，节约原材料，同时增加生产。
    中国神话中有猴王孙悟空大闹天宫的故事，但是同这种把整个车间和工厂大破大立的磅礴的气势相比，连这位猴王也望尘莫及。有若干世纪历史的缓慢的、费力的方法几乎在一夜之间就变得无影无踪。机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化变成了全民的要求。现在在我们面前出现了一个有着高度政治觉悟的群众革命运动，这个运动正在一个高潮接着一个高潮，有计划、有领导地逐步实现国民经济的一切部门的技术改造。
    在每个生产和服务部门，从最大的现代化的工厂直到街道车间，到处都可以感到运动的热烈的气氛。工人根据自己丰富的经验创造出来的土的然而又非常科学的办法起了重大的作用。它们或是单独地被使用着，或是与世界上最新的技术和科学结合起来使用。在许多情况下，创造了完全新的方法和技术。
    这样就使生产再度突飞猛进，质量和精密程度有了提高，无数的新产品试制成功，新的原料来源找到了，进一步实行节约的巨大潜力发现了。整个生产技术和劳动组织比大跃进的1958—1959年有了更广泛和更深刻的发展。
    以上说明了什么呢？这说明人人都在用自己的手和脑来从事发明和革新，根除旧的生产方法和创造新的生产方法，全面消除中国工业的落后状况。现在没有人能怀疑，这种群众性的行动是实现中国共产党提出的在1960年实现更大、更好和更全面的跃进的口号的保证之一。
    有了工人阶级的创造精神作借镜，运动很自然地发展到农村。彻底改造我们的农业是共产党的长期计划。人民公社已经办了许多中小型的工业。除了城市送出了大批机器外，农村中正普遍开展着一个以土办法和就地取材为主的使农业建设和耕作机械化、半机械化的运动。与此同时，成批的技术人员、工程师和工人下乡去帮助公社搞技术革新和技术革命，帮助训练一支农民的技术队伍，从而进一步加强了工农联盟。这对我们农村具有革命的意义。它正在进一步推动公社的农业生产和工业生产。由于有着这种新的动力，公社将再度证明它们作为我国建设社会主义的基层单位的巨大优越性。
    这样一种席卷一切的技术革新和技术革命的浪潮，只有在社会主义社会中才能出现。劳动人民不必像在资本主义制度下面那样害怕大规模的建设和改进生产过程会使任何人成为“多余的人”或者失业。不，在我们国家里，建设是由工人自己勇猛地领导的！生产资料掌握在他们自己手中，没有人剥削人的现象。提高效率只会使工人转到其他紧急的工作岗位上去，只会给全中国人民带来更美好的生活和更多的机会来进一步研究和提高业务。
    技术革新和技术革命正在对我国经济、政治、文化生活发生深远的影响。在生产技术全面提高的基础上，劳动生产率正在迅速提高，资金积累加快，生产资料正在得到持续的迅速的发展。这一切将加速社会主义建设和大大改变我们国家的面貌。
    人是一切进步的首要动力。是人，进行了使生产资料能够增加的革命，并在这个过程中使自己在精神上得到解放。是无产阶级领导的社会主义革命，使经济和文化得到史无前例的程度的解放。在社会主义制度下，社会生产力从一个跃进被推向另一个跃进，从而促使生产关系逐步发生变化，并使人的思想得到进步。在保护新社会、征服自然和不断提高生活水平的没有止境的斗争中，人改造了环境，也改造了自己。
    我们目前技术革新和技术革命的情况正是如此。它既是一个技术上的伟大的革命运动，又是一个生产上和思想上的伟大的革命运动。新事物只有通过同旧事物的斗争中才能成长。在生产和劳动组织方面的新的方式是从过去的形式中产生的。右倾保守思想容忍陈旧过时的东西，使目前的一切停滞不前，因此往往成为阻止社会主义飞跃发展的羁绊。当前的运动正是对这种思想的宣战。中国劳动人民清楚地表明他们是完全理解这个思想斗争的意义的。在不多天的时间内，他们以实际行动在这方面击溃了右倾思想。这样，他们就表明他们决心在建设社会主义的事业中不仅做到“多、快”，而且做到“好、省”。
    人们从这个革命风暴里得出两个思想方面的重要教训：第一，人的观点决定他能把生产资料、生活和整个社会向前推进得多远多快。第二，集体的生活和斗争方式无疑是最有效的。这些马克思列宁主义原则在劳动人民思想中得到了进一步的巩固和更深刻的理解。人们在工作中和同志关系中表现出的共产主义风格已经发扬到新的高度。今天，在我们国家里，人们考虑问题时不是以“我”为中心，而是以我们六亿五千万人这个大集体为中心。
    工人农民废寝忘食，忘我地全力搞技术革新和技术革命，这种动人事迹真是说也说不完。他们彼此互相支援，不甘失败，有时候进行了几百次实验，最后才获得成功。我们现在有许多以真人真事为题材的诗歌、戏剧和电影，反映这种为了我们国家的进步的共同事业而作的共产主义的努力。但是作家和艺术家们虽然深入现场搜集材料，仍然遇到很大困难。他们发现局势发展如此快，故事如此多，内容又如此丰富多彩，使他们难以赶上实际生活的发展，难以生动地加以描绘。
    在劳动人民的干劲和集体主义精神的感召下，在面临着新的巨大的需要的情况下，科学和教育工作者同全国人民一齐奋战。他们加快了文化革命和科学研究的速度，以满足群众的无限的求知欲，把科学提高到解决生产中的重大问题所需要的水平。
    “把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”这个共产主义的口号已经在我们社会里生了根。先进正在帮助后进，使他们也成为先进，大家一道变得更先进。人们尽一切力量不让任何一个人“落后”。行政领导、工人和技术人员协作。个人帮个人，车间帮车间，工厂帮工厂。一种行业支援另一行业，一个城市或地区支援另一城市或地区。共产主义精神和工作作风正在成为一支物质力量。它们已经成为推动社会主义建设的巨大动力。共产主义精神在共产主义实现以前已经出现了。它成为一个无限的力量的源泉，使光辉的未来一天一天接近现实。
    同样的精神也促使过去主要在农村建立的人民公社在全国各地的城市里建立起来。这是一个具有重大历史意义的伟大的革命性群众运动，它把生活的一切方面合理地组织起来，促进生产力的迅速发展，并增进城市居民的福利。它将彻底改变城市生活的面貌。根据农村的经验和城市试点的经验，我们可以看出城市公社将扩大生产和改组社会生活，从而解放更多的劳动力。城市人民公社特别要把被许多琐碎的家务劳动束缚在家庭小圈子里的妇女解放出来，并且进一步以共产主义的集体主义精神教育人民。这个新生的事物在全国受到热烈欢迎。我国人民把它看作是一个新的振奋人心的发展，是我们的生活的一切方面的革命形势的又一个反映，是促使我们取得全面的进步的又一个鼓舞力量。
    中国人民目前正在取得的显著的进展标志着党的建设社会主义的总路线、党的继续大跃进的政策和人民公社的又一个胜利。所有这一切都体现了党的群众路线。它们的成功表明人民更加信赖和信任党，坚决跟着党走，党指向那里，他们就走向那里。
    我们国家的进步是建筑在党的正确的政策的基础上的，而这些政策正是体现了毛泽东主席和党运用于中国的具体实践的伟大的马克思列宁主义真理。在新民主主义革命时期是如此，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中也是如此。毛主席和党制订了中国的不断取得胜利的道路，这就丰富了马克思列宁主义思想的宝库。
    在党的领导下，我国人民不断提高了对世界及其变化规律的认识，加深了对革命的发展从一个阶段不间断地进入另一阶段的了解。中国人民在思想上更好地武装了起来，他们有着高度的政治觉悟和充沛的革命热情，准备迎接每个新的革命形势的到来。党使这种永不松弛的革命精神保持下去，用以激发我国人民的创造精神。在中国共产党的正确领导下，它成为一支推动我国的连续不断的经济、政治和文化革命的经常起作用的力量。
    资产阶级历史学家和宣传家们企图用“革命”这个字眼来吓唬人。他们企图把这个字眼从自己的历史和基本文件中抹掉，好像这个字眼本身能变戏法，变出一种客观环境，要求同过去、同过去的混乱以及过去广大劳动人民所遭受的数不尽的苦难一刀两断。但是敢于正视现实的人是不会被革命这个字眼和革命的前景吓倒的。他们认识到马克思说的“革命是历史的火车头”这句话是多么正确。
    中国人民对这一点是深信不疑的。革命把我们引导到光辉的现在，又给予我们灿烂的未来。它使中国能够站立起来，并且作为一个有悠久历史和丰富文化的国家对人类进步和世界和平作出应有的贡献。现在这已经成为压倒西风的东风的一部分，它为保卫和平反对帝国主义者的阴谋创造了有利条件，并使各国之间的和平共处成为可能。
    中国的工人阶级为自己已经进行的革命感到自豪，也为自己今天正在进行的把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、农业、科学和文化的繁荣富强的国家的革命感到自豪。同时，我国人民是谦虚的，因为我们知道我们还有许多必须做的事，还有许多必须学的东西。
    我们是同全世界一切地方的劳动人民合为一体的。我们把自己已获得的胜利看作是全世界人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的广泛的运动的一部分。这个运动的标志就是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。我们深信这个运动必将获得最后胜利。
