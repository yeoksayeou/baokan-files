    Closest are the Worker-Peasant Brothers
    Ài Lǐ, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Harbin No. 1 Machine Manufacturing Plant

    At the National Conference of Heroes in October last year, the Party, based on the new situation of continuous Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction over the past two years, put forward the great call for industry to support agricultural technological transformation. The Party's call not only reflected the urgent wishes of the broad masses of peasants but also expressed the far-reaching ideals of the working class.

    Our Harbin No. 1 Machine Manufacturing Plant, under the correct leadership of the Party for several years, has deeply felt in the practical work of supporting agricultural technological transformation that it is necessary to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and launch a vigorous mass movement. In 1958 alone, from supporting agriculture in fighting drought to supporting autumn harvest and deep plowing, the workers used their spare time and leftover materials to manufacture well-drilling bits and water pumps for the countryside and repair agricultural machinery. In the spring of 1959, we also specifically helped a suburban agricultural management area to realize electrification and mechanized irrigation.

    Our main method of mobilizing the masses to support agriculture is to organize workers to establish amateur small factories for supporting agricultural technological transformation. Our factory originally had three amateur small factories serving the countryside. After the Party put forward the call for industry to support agricultural technological transformation in October last year, after rectification and development, they became nineteen. The number of workers participating in amateur small factories expanded from the original two hundred to more than one thousand seven hundred. These amateur small factories include nine industries, including agricultural machinery repair, farm tool manufacturing, electrical, broadcasting, and tools. From October last year to February this year, they repaired and manufactured industrial machine tools for the countryside, manufactured agricultural machinery, repaired agricultural machinery and vehicles, and manufactured more than two thousand eight hundred small farm tools and parts, and renovated more than one thousand seven hundred old tools (sets) to support the countryside. The broad masses of workers, after years of education in the worker-peasant alliance, actively signed up to participate in amateur small factories, doing everything possible to overcome difficulties to manufacture and repair machines for the countryside, all regarding it as an honor to make more contributions to supporting agriculture in addition to completing the state plan. The sixteen workers of the agricultural machinery small factory in the machining workshop heard that the Dongfeng Commune was running a factory but lacked machines, so they worked hard for most of the night to repair two old machine tools to support the countryside. The Dongfeng Management Area wanted to establish a wired broadcasting station but lacked equipment, so the five workers of the amateur electrical small factory worked hard for five nights to modify a five-hundred-watt amplifier and manufactured one thousand four hundred loudspeakers, meeting the needs of the countryside. When the amateur agricultural machinery small factory manufactured straw cutters and lacked angle steel, they all went to turn over scrap iron piles, and in more than ten days they found more than three tons of suitable angle steel, ensuring production. When manufacturing bean cake cutters, the time was tight, the task was heavy, and the boring machine time was insufficient, so everyone thought of ways to carry out technical innovation. They came up with a method of replacing milling machines with lathes and drilling machines, and created a three-speed variable feed method, which increased the boring machine processing efficiency by more than seven times. In order to fully tap the potential of the factory's equipment and materials, the workers participating in the amateur small factories put forward the bold slogan: "Small factory, big ambition, not afraid of any difficulties, insufficient equipment relies on innovation, no materials are found everywhere, if the shift is not finished, do it in amateur time, don't let go of every minute and every second, do everything possible to make machines and send them to farmers for mechanization."

    In mid-January 1960, the Dongfeng Management Area wanted to achieve electrification, but the electrical materials and installation problems could not be solved. The amateur electrical small factory of our factory bravely undertook this task. After obtaining the consent of the factory and workshop leaders, they moved the power distribution reform and electrical repair tasks to the Spring Festival holiday, and dispatched sixteen electricians to form a shock team, with the determination to "ensure that the commune members eat dumplings under the electric lights during the Spring Festival." They rushed to the countryside on the same day they received the task. On the night they arrived in the countryside, they began a tense assault. After thirteen days of effort, the seven natural villages of the Dongfeng Management Area, distributed over sixty square kilometers of land, all achieved electrification from power to lighting, achieving electric lights in every home, radio listening in every household, and telephones in every team. On the evening of the Spring Festival, the entire management area was filled with the sound of motors, the turning of machines, the singing of songs broadcast all over the mountains and fields, and the bright lights inside and outside the houses. The peasants said with emotion: "Thousands of lines, ten thousand lights, the closest are the worker-peasant brothers."

    In order to cooperate with the tense assault of the electrical shock team, the amateur small factories in the factory's machining, forging, and machine repair workshops accepted emergency "orders" from the installation site at any time, often calling the night before to propose the specifications and quantities of urgently needed parts, and sending them to the countryside early the next morning. In the past ten days, the three amateur small factories used the time before work in the morning to rush to manufacture electrical materials such as magnetic bottle poles, leg-connecting screws, and iron pull belts for the countryside. The peasants praised the enthusiasm of the amateur small factories, saying: "The worker elder brothers are truly wholeheartedly for us."

    In the actual work of the past few years, we feel that the main advantages of organizing amateur small factories in response to rural needs are: First, we can comprehensively organize the masses, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and make full use of the factory's leftover materials and equipment potential to give the countryside comprehensive and timely support for technological transformation in addition to completing the state plan; Second, the mass production activities of industrial support for agricultural technological transformation can be organized, led, planned, and carried out regularly and persistently; Third, through the production activities of supporting agricultural technological transformation, the factory and the countryside are closely linked together, giving the workers practical education in the worker-peasant alliance, socialism, and communism; Fourth, it promotes the in-depth development of the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, thereby promoting the factory's production; Fifth, it accelerates the technical training and exercise of new workers.

    In order to continuously consolidate and improve the amateur small factories on the existing basis, our Party Committee has made necessary regulations and corresponding resolutions on some more important issues such as the organization and management of amateur small factories, working hours, and cost accounting. At the same time, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the mass movement, it was also determined that a main leading cadre of the workshop's Party General Branch and Branch Committee should be responsible for leading the work of the amateur small factories, so that the amateur small factories truly become an effective form of mobilizing and organizing the masses; become a powerful production and technical team supporting agricultural technological transformation.

    最亲莫过工农弟兄
    中共哈尔滨第一机器制造厂委员会书记　爱里
    去年10月的全国群英会上，党根据我国社会主义建设两年来的连续大跃进的新形势，提出了工业支援农业技术改造的伟大号召。党的号召不仅反映了广大农民的迫切愿望，同时也表达了工人阶级的远大理想。
    我们哈尔滨第一机器制造厂，几年来在党的正确领导下，在支援农业技术改造的实际工作中，体会比较深的，是必须发动群众、依靠群众、大搞群众运动。1958年一年间，从支援农业抗旱到支援秋收和深翻，职工利用业余、工余时间和边材余料，为农村制造打井钻头，水泵，检修农业机器。1959年春，还具体帮助一个近郊农业管理区，实现了电气化和抽水灌溉机械化。
    我们发动群众支援农业的主要办法，是组织职工建立支援农业技术改造的业余小工厂。我们工厂原有三个为农村服务的业余小工厂。去年10月，党提出工业支援农业技术改造的号召以后，经过整顿发展成为十九个。参加业余小工厂的工人由原来的二百多人，扩大到一千七百多人。这些业余小工厂共包括农业机器修配、农具制造、电气、广播、工具等九种行业。从去年10月到今年2月，共为农村修理制造工业用机床，制造农业机器，检修农业机器和车辆，并且制造小型农具和零件两千八百多件，翻修工厂的旧工具一千七百多件（套）支援农村。广大职工群众，经过多年的工农联盟教育，他们积极报名参加业余小工厂，千方百计克服困难为农村制造和修理机器，都以在完成国家计划之外，能够为支援农业做出更多的贡献为光荣。机械加工车间的农业机械小工厂的十六名工人，听说东风公社办工厂没机器，就大干多半夜修出两台旧机床，支援了农村。东风管理区要建立有线广播站缺设备，业余电气小工厂的五名工人，就大干五个夜晚，改装出五百瓦扩大器一台，并制造广播喇叭一千四百个，满足了农村的需要。业余农业机械小工厂制造铡草机缺角钢，他们就一齐下手去翻废铁堆，十几天就找来合用的角钢三吨多，保证了生产。制造切豆饼机时间紧、任务重、镗床台时不足，就大家想办法搞技术革新，他们想出了以车床和钻床代替铣床的办法，并创造了三次变速进刀法，使镗床加工效率提高七倍多。为充分挖掘工厂设备、材料的潜力，参加业余小工厂的工人提出了“厂小雄心大，困难全不怕，设备不足靠革新，材料没有遍地挖，班上没完业余干，分分秒秒不放过它，千方百计造机器，送给农民机械化”的豪迈口号。
    1960年1月中旬，东风管理区要实现电气化，但电气材料和安装问题解决不了，我厂的业余电气小工厂勇敢地承担了这项任务。他们在征得工厂和车间领导同意后，把配电改革和电气检修任务，挪到春节假期，抽出十六名电工组成突击队，带着“保证过春节让社员在电灯光下吃饺子”的决心，在接到任务的当天就赶到了农村。到了农村的当夜，就开始了紧张的突击。经过十三天的努力，使东风管理区分布在六十平方公里土地上的七个自然屯从动力到照明，全部实现了电气化，达到了家家有电灯，户户听广播和队队有电话。春节的晚上整个管理区马达响、机器转，满山遍野地广播歌声，屋里屋外电灯明亮。农民感动地说：“千条线、万盏灯，最亲莫过工农弟兄。”
    为配合电气突击队的紧张突击，工厂里机械加工、锻造、机修等三个车间的业余小工厂，随时接受安装现场的紧急“订货”，往往前日夜里打来电话，提出急需零件的规格和数量，次日一早就要送去农村。在十几天的时间里，三个业余小工厂利用早晨上班前的时间，为农村突击制造磁瓶杆、接腿螺丝、铁拉带等电气器材。农民称赞业余小工厂的干劲说：“工人老大哥对咱们真是全心全意。”
    在几年来的实际工作中，我们感到针对农村需要，组织业余小工厂的主要好处有这样几点：一，可以全面地组织群众，调动群众的积极性，充分利用工厂的边材余料和设备潜力，在完成国家计划之外，给农村技术改造以全面、及时的支援；二，使工业支援农业技术改造的群众性的生产活动做到有组织、有领导、有计划和经常持久地进行；三，通过支援农业技术改造的生产活动，把工厂和农村紧紧地联系在一起，给职工以工农联盟、社会主义和共产主义的实际教育；四，促进工厂技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展，从而推动了工厂的生产；五，加速了对新工人技术上的培养和锻炼。
    为使业余小工厂在现有基础上不断地巩固与提高，我们党委对业余小工厂的组织管理、劳动时间、成本核算等一些较重要的问题，都做出了必要的规定和相应的决议。同时为加强党对群众运动的领导，还确定车间党的总支和支部委员会，要有一名主要领导干部，负责领导业余小工厂的工作，从而使业余小工厂真正成为发动与组织群众的有效形式；成为支援农业技术改造的一支强大的生产技术队伍。
