The Budget Committee of the Second National People's Congress, after listening to Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, carefully reviewed the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and studied the relevant opinions raised by the delegates. Now, on behalf of the Budget Committee, I will report the results of the review as follows.

The 1959 National Final Accounts show revenue of 54.16 billion yuan and expenditure of 52.77 billion yuan, resulting in a surplus of 1.39 billion yuan. Both revenue and expenditure in the 1959 National Final Accounts exceeded the original budget and achieved a surplus. Compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, national fiscal revenue increased by 12.3 billion yuan and expenditure increased by 11.81 billion yuan in 1959. The Budget Committee believes that the over-fulfillment of the 1959 national fiscal revenue and expenditure effectively guaranteed the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and the achievements are very significant.

The rapid growth of fiscal revenue in 1959 is the result of the high-speed, proportionate development of China's socialist economy. More than 98% of the increase in fiscal revenue in 1959 compared to 1958 came from the income of state-owned enterprises, which was the result of rapidly developing production, increasing labor productivity, and reducing costs, rather than increasing the burden on the people. Due to the significant development of agricultural and sideline production in 1959, while the agricultural tax and local surcharges on agricultural tax levied by the state from the rural people's communes were roughly the same as in 1958, the burden on farmers was relatively reduced compared to their income. In 1959, a total of 42.46 billion yuan was spent on economic construction, scientific, cultural, educational, and health construction, and increased allocations to bank credit funds, accounting for 80.5% of the total expenditure. Among the various expenditures, basic construction investment amounted to 26.7 billion yuan, accounting for 50.6% of the total expenditure. These expenditures all represent considerable increases compared to 1958, ensuring the continued Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction.

The Budget Committee believes that the execution of the 1959 National Budget was very good. In this year, there was a significant increase in national credit revenue and expenditure, national prices were stable, the market was prosperous, and national material reserves increased. This is a victory for the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; it is a victory for the people of the whole country who responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy; and ultimately, it is a victory for the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress approve the 1959 National Final Accounts submitted by the State Council.

The 1960 National Budget Draft submitted by the State Council shows revenue and expenditure each at 70.02 billion yuan, with a balance between revenue and expenditure. Compared with 1959, revenue increased by 15.86 billion yuan and expenditure increased by 17.25 billion yuan.

Looking at the composition of the sources of national budget revenue for 1960, payments from state-owned enterprises under the system of ownership by the whole people account for 93.4%; payments from rural people's communes and other sources account for 6.6%. Of the increase in budget revenue in 1960 compared to 1959, 99% comes from the income of state-owned enterprises. These figures show that the main source of growth in national budget revenue in 1960 is the development of the state-owned economy; at the same time, it also shows that the payments from rural people's communes in 1960 will remain at the 1959 level, and the proportion of the burden on rural people's communes to the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations will be further reduced compared to the previous year.

The task of the Chinese people in 1960 is to better implement the general line of socialist construction and achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in the national economy. The vast majority of the 1960 national budget expenditure is used for construction undertakings. Expenditures on economic construction, scientific, cultural, educational, and health construction, and increased allocations to bank credit funds total 57.3 billion yuan, accounting for 81.9% of the total expenditure, which is not only a significant increase in absolute terms compared to 1959, but also an increase in the proportion of total expenditure. National defense expenditure accounts for only 8.3% of the total expenditure, and administrative expenditure accounts for only 4.5% of the total expenditure, with their proportions further reduced compared to 1959. Basic construction investment in the 1960 National Budget is 32.5 billion yuan, an increase of 21.7% over 1959. The Budget Committee believes that the arrangement of national budget expenditures is reasonable. Appropriate proportional relationships have been maintained between various departments and between the central and local governments.

The 1960 National Budget fully embodies the principle of supporting agriculture and supporting rural people's communes. Basic construction investment in the agricultural machinery industry in the budget increased more than fivefold compared to 1959, basic construction investment in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology increased by 62.9% compared to 1959, operating expenses for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology increased by 56%, and the state's investment in people's communes increased by 50%. In addition, local funds used for agriculture amount to approximately 1.5 billion yuan, and the People's Bank will also add 500 million yuan in agricultural loans. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. In order to better combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, it is absolutely necessary to increase expenditures in agriculture. The result of the budget's execution will further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. Combining these state investments with the people's communes' own accumulation, arranging them reasonably, and using them effectively will surely further consolidate and develop the people's communes, accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, more powerfully promote the development of agricultural production, and create conditions for achieving the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule.

In the 1960 National Budget, the allocation for scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings increased by 47.1% compared to 1959, while basic construction investment in science, culture, education, and health increased by 65.7%. In order to accelerate the process of cultural revolution, vigorously develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and strive to climb the peaks of science and technology, it is absolutely necessary for the expenditure on scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the national budget to have a larger increase.

Based on the above situation, the Budget Committee believes that the 1960 National Budget is a budget that guarantees the continued leap forward of the national economy, a budget that is both active and reliable, and a budget for peaceful construction. This budget reflects the Chinese people's ambition to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress approve this budget. Due to the rapid development of China's production and construction undertakings and the continuous increase in the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese people, the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is developing vigorously, and it is possible that the revenue budget for 1960 will be overfulfilled. The State Council should actively organize revenue on the basis of production development, and when revenue increases, arrange expenditures in a timely manner, expand the scale of construction, and make timely adjustments to this budget as needed and as possible.

At present, China's political and economic situation is extremely good. The financial departments should make full use of this favorable situation, continue to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously promote mass movements, support the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, support industrial and agricultural production, support scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, support urban and rural people's communes, and assist people's communes in strengthening financial management. In all work, we should continue to implement the policy of building the country and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, and through the efforts of the people of all nationalities in the country, we will surely be able to fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 National Economic Plan and the 1960 National Budget.

Please examine the above opinions, delegates.

    第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会关于一九五九年国家决算和一九六○年国家预算草案的审查报告	第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会主任委员　曾山
    第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会在听了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告以后，详细地审查了1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案，并且研究了代表们提出的有关意见。现在，我代表预算委员会将审查的结果报告如下。
    1959年国家决算收入五百四十一亿六千万元，支出五百二十七亿七千万元，收支相抵后，结余十三亿九千万元。1959年国家决算收入和支出都超额完成了原来的预算，并且做到收多于支。同大跃进的1958年比较，1959年国家财政收入增加一百二十三亿元，支出增加一百一十八亿一千万元。预算委员会认为，1959年国家财政收支的超额完成，有力地保证了国民经济的大跃进，成绩是非常显著的。
    1959年财政收入这样快的增长是我国社会主义经济高速度按比例发展的结果。1959年财政收入比1958年增加的部分，98％以上是来自国营企业的收入，是迅速发展生产，提高劳动生产率和降低成本的结果，而不是增加人民的负担。由于1959年农副业生产有了很大的发展，而国家向农村人民公社征收的农业税和农业税的地方附加同1958年大体相等，因此，同农民的收入比较，农民的负担相对地减轻了。1959年财政总支出中，用于经济建设、科学文化教育卫生建设和增拨银行信贷资金方面的支出共四百二十四亿六千万元，占总支出的80.5％。在各项支出中，基本建设投资二百六十七亿元，占总支出的50.6％。这些支出，比之1958年都有相当大的增长，保证了我国社会主义建设事业的继续大跃进。
    预算委员会认为，1959年国家预算执行情况是十分良好的。在这一年，国家信贷收支有了很大的增长，全国物价稳定，市场繁荣，国家物资库存有了增加。这是社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利，是全国劳动人民响应党的八届八中全会号召反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的胜利，归根结底，是中国共产党和毛泽东同志英明领导的胜利。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会批准国务院提出的1959年国家决算。
    国务院提出的1960年国家预算草案，收入和支出各为七百亿零二千万元，收支平衡。同1959年比较，收入增加一百五十八亿六千万元，支出增加一百七十二亿五千万元。
    从1960年国家预算收入来源的构成来看，来自全民所有制的国营企业的缴款占93.4％；来自农村人民公社和其他方面的缴款占6.6％。1960年预算收入比1959年增加的部分，99％来自国营企业的收入。这些数字表明，1960年国家预算收入增长的主要源泉是国营经济的发展；同时也说明，1960年农村人民公社的缴款仍然保持1959年的水平，农村人民公社的负担占农副业总产值的比例比上年将有进一步的降低。
    我国人民在1960年的任务是更好地贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，实现国民经济更好的全面的跃进。1960年的国家预算支出，绝大部分用于建设事业。经济建设、科学文化教育卫生建设和增拨银行信贷资金方面的支出共计五百七十三亿元，占总支出的81.9％，不仅绝对数字比1959年有很大的增长，而且占总支出的比重也增加了。国防费只占总支出的8.3％，行政费只占总支出的4.5％，其比重都比1959年有了进一步的降低。1960年国家预算中的基本建设投资为三百二十五亿元，比1959年增长21.7％。预算委员会认为，国家预算支出的安排是合理的。各部门之间、中央和地方之间都保持了适当的比例关系。
    1960年国家预算支出充分体现了支援农业、支援农村人民公社的方针。预算中农业机械工业的基本建设投资比1959年增长五倍多，农林水利气象的基本建设投资比1959年增长62.9％，农林水利气象的事业费增长56％，国家对人民公社的投资增长50％。此外，地方自有资金用于农业的支出约有十五亿元，人民银行还要新增五亿元的农业贷款。农业是国民经济的基础，为了更好地把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，增加农业方面的支出是完全必要的。预算执行的结果，将进一步加强工农联盟。把国家的这些投资同人民公社本身的积累结合起来，合理地安排，有效地使用，就一定能够进一步巩固和发展人民公社，加速农业的技术改造，更有力地促进农业生产的发展，并为提前实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要创造条件。
    1960年国家预算中对科学文化教育卫生事业的拨款比1959年增长47.1％，而科学文化教育卫生的基本建设投资则增加65.7％。为了加速文化革命的进程，大办文化教育卫生事业，努力攀登科学技术高峰，国家预算中的科学文化教育卫生事业支出有较大的增长是完全必要的。
    根据上述情况，预算委员会认为，1960年国家预算是一个保证国民经济继续跃进的预算，是一个既积极又可靠的预算，是一个和平建设的预算。这个预算反映了我国人民鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的雄心壮志。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会批准这个预算。由于我国生产建设事业的迅速发展和我国人民革命干劲的不断高涨，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地开展，1960年收入预算超额完成的可能是存在的。国务院应当在生产发展的基础上，积极组织收入，在收入增加的时候，及时安排支出，扩大建设规模，并且按照需要和可能，在这个预算的基础上及时进行调整。
    现在，我国的政治经济形势是极为良好的。财政部门应当充分利用这种有利形势，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，支持以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，支援工农业生产，支援科学文化教育卫生事业，支援城乡人民公社，协助人民公社加强财务管理工作。在各项工作中，都应当继续贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，经过全国各族人民的努力，我们一定能够完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划，一定能够完成和超额完成1960年国家预算。
    以上意见，请大会审查。
