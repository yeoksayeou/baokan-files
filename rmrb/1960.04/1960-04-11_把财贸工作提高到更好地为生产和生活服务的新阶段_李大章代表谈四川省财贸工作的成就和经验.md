I fully agree with the three reports made to the conference by the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Premier Tan, and I will resolutely implement them in my future work. I would now like to speak on the financial and trade work in Sichuan Province.

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of our province, holding high the red flags of the socialist construction general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the severe natural disasters unprecedented in decades. They launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and carried out the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, to boost morale, defend the general line, and promote the socialist education movement. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they achieved another great victory in the sustained leap forward of the entire national economy.

Driven by the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a new situation of sustained leap forward has also emerged in the financial and trade work of our province. This new situation of leap forward is not only reflected in the unprecedented speed with which the procurement tasks of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil were overfulfilled, ensuring a continuous increase in commodities, stable prices, and a prosperous market, but also in the initial exploration of advanced experiences in some regions and departments in promoting the high-speed development of industry and agriculture, opening up a broad road of advancement for the great development of financial and trade work. To summarize the experiences of these regions and departments, the most basic and important points can be summarized as follows:

I. Actively and proactively participate in production, organize production, and do everything possible to serve the high-speed development of production.

Socialist commerce, finance, and banking departments are tools for the state to organize the distribution of materials and funds to ensure continuous expanded reproduction. Therefore, their primary task is to serve the high-speed development of production. However, for this obvious and important issue, it has not been resolved for a long time in some financial and trade departments in our province. They did not put 90% of their energy and time into supporting industrial and agricultural production, but remained in the simple business circle of "waiting for customers to come, receiving and paying out," so their work was often in a state of busyness and passivity. The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production greatly liberated the thinking of cadres in the financial and trade departments and increased their enthusiasm, finally enabling them to step out of the office and begin to find ways to serve production. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, they participated in production, organized production, and did everything possible to serve production.

The participation of financial and trade departments in production in our province began with the commercial departments, and then gradually developed to the finance, banking, and grain departments. The development process of financial and trade departments participating in production was not smooth sailing, and it went through a series of struggles; the participation of financial and trade departments in production has not only broken away from the simple business circle of "calculating and calculating," but also has corrected and is correcting the view that participation in production is only for completing departmental tasks. This is a major change in financial and trade work, and it has found a very broad road for the future development and continued leap forward of financial and trade work. Wherever departments and units have embarked on this road, their work has immediately changed, greatly improved, the road has become wider and wider, and the work has become more and more vigorous. The work of the financial and trade departments in Liangping, Wusheng, Jiangyou, and Suining counties in our province is constantly advancing along this road. They have made relatively remarkable achievements and have gained some advanced experiences.

Since last year, the commercial department of Liangping County has actively organized cadres to go deep into the communes, participate in the production planning of the communes, vigorously help the communes develop diversified operations, and vigorously run commune-run industries. Last year, they signed more than 4,500 contracts of various combinations with the people's communes and production brigades, and overfulfilled all the tasks at the end of the year, greatly supporting the development of industrial and agricultural production. When the county suffered a severe drought last year, the commercial department regarded the fight against drought as the central task of its department, shared weal and woe with the farmers of the county, watered the fields with waterwheels, promptly supplied various irrigation tools, and actively organized cadres to purchase and transport late autumn crop seeds, thus successfully completing the task of replanting and supplementing more than 300,000 mu of late autumn crops and 260,000 mu of vegetables. In order to make the agricultural loans issued by the finance and banking departments of Jiangyou County truly ahead of spring plowing and play a better role in supporting production, they took the initiative to find out how many means of production the people's communes and production brigades currently have, how many means of production are still lacking, and how many means of production the commercial departments can supply before spring plowing. They then actively helped the communes to run farm tool factories, pesticide factories, fertilizer factories, and feed factories; and actively organized the masses to repair farm tools, and educated the masses to cherish farm tools and other public property. In this way, under the leadership of the county party committee and the county people's committee, a vigorous movement of sending fertilizer and running "four factories" was quickly launched with the participation of organs, factories, schools, urban cadres, workers, students, and residents, solving the difficulty of insufficient means of production, and thus rapidly pushing spring plowing production to a new climax. Jiangyou Bank summarized this development process from participating in production, organizing production, to serving production as fourteen characters, which is called "one investigation, two deliveries, three manufactures, and a combination of manufactures, repairs, supplements, and cherish." In the past, the grain department was always considered to be only in charge of grain and not production, but in the Great Leap Forward, the Yangkou Grain Station in Wusheng County broke this convention. They carried out a major debate on "serving whom" among all grain station employees, and carried out education on the general line and the three major views of politics, production, and the masses. Grain cadres also walked out of the warehouse and participated in agricultural production and the work of collecting, threshing, and drying grain. Last year, all the employees of the station worked 1,600 workdays and helped the commune accumulate and manufacture 2.48 million catties of fertilizer. Not only that, they also managed the grain management work, from only managing the state grain in the past to managing the rations, feed, seeds, and reserve grain of the communes and production brigades from beginning to end. This is a new initiative in financial and trade work. In this way, a vigorous new situation has also emerged on the grain front. It is particularly worth mentioning that when financial and trade departments participate in production and support production, they also carry out the work of supporting poor teams to catch up with rich teams, which has played a positive role in promoting the consolidation and development of the people's communes. For example, the bank cadres of Jiangyou County regarded the poor team as their home and vigorously supported the poor team to catch up with the rich team with great enthusiasm. In their work, they created the methods of "three togethers" (eat together, live together, and work together), "four guarantees" (guarantee the issuance of loans, guarantee the unified arrangement and use of funds, guarantee the realization of production plans, and guarantee the income to catch up with the general level of the local area), and "one rod to the end" (supporting the poor team to catch up with the rich team). Finally, twenty-five poor teams basically caught up with the rich teams in a short period of time. In the work of supporting the poor team to catch up with the rich team, Yangkou Grain Station in Wusheng County put forward the battle cry of "the combination of 'help' (that is, helping the poor team to formulate production plans and helping the poor team to run factories), 'dig' (that is, tapping human, material, and financial resources, relying on self-reliance, and developing production), 'check' (that is, checking plans and checking production, discovering problems, reflecting in time, and solving in time), and 'support' (that is, providing human, material, and technical assistance), and will definitely make the poor team catch up with the rich team." Encouraged by this battle cry, after a year of hard work, they finally made the poor team they helped catch up with the rich team.

The common experiences of the financial and trade departments in our province in participating in production, organizing production, and actively serving production are: (1) Regard the work of the production department as their own work, proceed from production in everything, think about production in everything, and do everything possible to serve production; (2) Leave the difficulties to themselves and send the convenience to others, breathe together with the production department, share weal and woe, and eat, live, and work with the masses; (3) The financial and trade work, especially the distribution of means of production and funds, must be ahead of production.

However, the issue that financial and trade departments must actively participate in production, organize production, and serve production is not unanimously recognized from the beginning. In fact, there are two different ideas and two different practices, namely: one is to proceed from production, actively participate in production, serve production through business activities, and promote the development of production; the other is to proceed from business, also participate in production, but mainly to serve the completion of departmental tasks. The former is in line with the ideas and policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on developing the economy, ensuring supply, using 90% of the strength to develop production, and using 10% of the strength to increase financial revenue; the latter violates the above ideas and policies. Wherever there is the former idea and the former policy is implemented, the work has appeared a new situation. Wherever the latter idea exists and the latter policy is implemented, the work is not done well. It can be seen that the participation of financial and trade departments in production, organizing production, and actively serving production is by no means a general issue, but a fundamental issue of whether financial and trade work can be done well.

II. Actively organize and participate in the economic life of urban and rural people.

The work of financial and trade departments is closely related to the production and life of the broad masses of the people. Widely organizing people's economic life is a new task put forward to the financial and trade departments after the high-speed development of socialist construction and the communization of urban and rural areas. In order to adapt to this new situation, it requires the financial and trade departments to consciously and proactively undertake this new historical task of widely organizing people's economic life. Since the Great Leap Forward in our province in 1958, under the leadership of the local party committees and governments, the financial and trade departments, starting from organizing production and combined with the rural people's communes, first vigorously assisted in running rural public canteens. More than a year of practice has proved that vigorously running and running public canteens well can not only save the time of the broad masses of commune members, make their work attendance neat, and greatly improve labor productivity, which is conducive to promoting the development of production, but also can improve the collective consciousness and socialist awareness of commune members through collective labor and collective life, making the public canteen both the center for organizing commune members' production and life, and a place conducive to carrying out political and cultural education for commune members. Therefore, the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee have always adopted the policy of "only allowing to run well and not allowing to run badly" for vigorously running public canteens. In terms of organizational leadership, it was decided that each level of the party committee should have a secretary in charge, and establish a life and welfare committee and office to be specifically responsible for this work. In terms of the grain supply policy, the method of "quantifying by person, distributing rations, eating in the canteen, and saving for self-gain" was adopted. After a year of practice last year, among the 555,000 public canteens in the province, a very small number were dissolved by right-leaning opportunists within the Party in a short period before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, but they were quickly automatically restored by the masses. Now more than 98% of the canteens have been persisted in and consolidated. It is precisely because we have adhered to the people's communes and adhered to the public canteens that we have been able to effectively overcome the major drought that our province has not seen in more than 30 years, ensuring the ration supply for all those who participate in the canteens, and thereby protecting the production enthusiasm and soaring energy of the masses, so that the grain output in 1959 still increased by 7% on the basis of the bumper harvest in 1958. This is in stark contrast to the desolate scene of red land for thousands of miles and fleeing famine everywhere that would appear before liberation when severe disasters occurred.

Since this year, the provincial party committee has further required all parts of the province to seize spring vegetable production, vigorously develop pigs, and further establish and improve the management system of public canteens in conjunction with spring plowing production. This has created extremely favorable conditions for further developing and consolidating the people's communes, further arranging the lives of commune members, and continuing to improve the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. It is worth pointing out here that the financial and trade departments have proactively done a lot of work in running public canteens, and in many areas, they have begun to achieve results and have gained relatively rich experience. For example, the cadres of Yangkou Grain Station in Wusheng County regard the canteen as their home, and adopt the method of eating, living, and working with the commune members, and vigorously engage in experimental fields, and have gained the experience of "three grasps and one change," namely: (1) Vigorously grasp planting vegetables and raising pigs. They first help the commune to make production plans, and then mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in planting vegetables by using the edges of fields, the corners of the land, in front of and behind houses, and mountain bays and pond banks. Because more vegetables are planted, it is easier to develop pigs. Now they have helped the commune plant more than 1,700 mu of vegetables and raise 24,520 pigs, an average of one pig per person; (2) Vigorously grasp planned grain use. In addition to completing the state grain purchase task, seeds, feed, rations, etc. each have their own, and special grain is used for special purposes; (3) Vigorously grasp the democratic management of the canteen. Select people with good composition, high awareness, enthusiastic service, and selfless people to serve as management personnel and cooks, and establish a canteen management committee, establish a system for grain receipt and expenditure management, and publish accounts regularly, and put the canteen under the supervision of the masses. "One change" is to reform cooking tools and open training classes for cooks, and help the canteen to universally install "local tap water," and manufacture a total of eleven kinds of slicing, shredding, dicing, and vegetable washing machines, with 467 pieces, saving more than 50,000 workdays, which has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses and cooks. They said: "Now ten chemicalizations are good, the stove is connected to the neighbor, washing vegetables does not require hands, and cutting vegetables does not require a knife."

Organizing people's economic life has not only accumulated relatively rich experience in rural areas, but also has initially explored some ways forward in cities. For example, the Shangxin Street commercial department in Chongqing, under the unified leadership of the party committee and the government, relying on the masses and cooperating with all parties, launched a mass movement to widely organize the people's economic life, helping the masses to comprehensively arrange and properly solve various trivial matters in eating, wearing, using, and household chores. This street has basically realized "three networks" (collective canteen network, nursery network, and life service network) and "one ization" (production collectivization). The residents' life style has been greatly changed, and the enthusiasm for production has become even higher, and a new trend of "every household is busy with production, and every family has no idlers" has truly emerged. The emergence of this new look and new fashion is actually the beginning of completely transforming the old consumer city into a new production city. The comprehensive experience of the commercial department of this street in organizing people's economic life is: (1) Rationally distributing goods. An employee on this street can more accurately understand the various different consumption and needs of more than 4,000 people in 1,000 households, and provide and distribute goods accordingly. This is a new distribution method. (2) Vigorously run various collective welfare undertakings, mainly focusing on running collective canteens well. Ensure that there is one thin and two dry meals for three meals a day, and two dishes and one soup for lunch and dinner, so that residents can eat their fill and eat well. (3) Carry out mutual assistance and cooperation and self-service movement in economic life by organizing residents to participate in production. It is particularly worth noting that the Guojiatuo in Chongqing has universally established a universal service department among street residents. This service department includes 181 service items. From the masses' consignment sales, purchasing on behalf of others, handling on behalf of others, repairs, rentals, family services, picking up and dropping off patients to weddings and funerals, it includes everything. Therefore, the masses call it the universal service department. The universal service department is a mass self-service organization, which handles things quickly and is convenient for the masses. It does not charge money or charges a small amount of money, which is very popular with the masses.

According to the above, it can be seen that organizing people's economic life is not only necessary for the Great Leap Forward in production and has active economic significance, but also has great political significance. Because organizing people's economic life can enable financial and trade workers to go deeper into the masses and understand the situation and needs of the masses, this is a further development of the Party's mass line in the work of the financial and trade departments. Close this link between the Party and the masses, can change people's spiritual outlook and the relationship between people, promote the communist style of cooperation, which is conducive to the high-speed development of socialist production and construction. In short, organizing people's economic life is a new and relatively perfect form of distribution in socialism. It can be predicted that with the rapid development of national construction, the great superiority of this new form of distribution will increasingly show.

However, this new historical task and its great significance have not been fully understood and accepted by all cadres on the financial and trade front. For example, some people think that it is "meddling in other people's business" to rationally distribute goods and actively deliver goods to the door according to the different requirements of urban and rural areas and individuals, and that vigorously running public canteens and actively organizing collective welfare and service undertakings is "not doing their job properly." In essence, the above-mentioned ideas reflect their lack of awareness of new things. Their thinking is still stuck in the old stage before the communization of the people's communes. Therefore, they cannot see that the old era of taking one household as the unit of production and life has been replaced by the new era of collective production and collective life with dozens, hundreds, and thousands of households as the unit.

The continuous forward development of the social mode of production inevitably requires a new way of life to adapt to it. The establishment, development and consolidation of urban and rural people's communes, the degree of collectivization of people's production and life is increasing day by day. Especially after the broad masses of women are freed from household labor and participate in collective social labor, they are even more eager to vigorously run public canteens and collective welfare undertakings. In this case, if we still take the past method of only managing production and not managing life, or only managing individual life and not managing collective life and managing collective life well, it will cause the separation of production and life and hinder the development of production. And this kind of must organize, lead and manage the collective production and collective life well is precisely the specific reflection of the current party's class line in production and life work. In order to develop production at high speed, it is necessary to strengthen and expand the proportion of collective production and collective life, which is completely in line with the class interests of the broad masses of the working people. For example, after carrying out large-scale collective production in rural areas, if we do not run or run public canteens well, it will not only affect the interests of a working people, but will affect the interests of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of working people. Similarly, if we do not run nurseries, or do not run nurseries well, it will not only affect the physical health of dozens or hundreds of working people's children, but will also affect the parents of dozens or hundreds of children from being able to concentrate on production. This is detrimental to the class interests of the working people.

It can be seen that organizing the people's economic life is by no means "not doing their job properly" or "meddling in other people's business," but is a necessary job and a necessary thing to be managed. It is the general trend and must be done. We must widely organize the people's economic life, and we must organize it well.

The above-mentioned experiences, which were created by the masses and are effective, need to be widely promoted in our province and continuously enriched and developed, so that financial and trade work can better serve production and life, especially the urgent task of vigorously supporting the high-speed development of agriculture. In order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to universally further improve the current work level and leadership level of all our financial and trade departments.

Under the same conditions, why is it that some of our financial and trade departments have always been at the forefront, while others are always lagging behind? In the final analysis, we believe that the main reason lies in leadership. Among the broad masses of grassroots leading cadres in urban and rural areas, in addition to individual cases where they adhere to the bourgeois stand and oppose the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, making it impossible to do their work well, in some other areas and departments, the reason why their work has not made much progress and has not made much progress for a long time is mainly because they do not have enough understanding of the current good situation, lack energy, and the idea of building socialism at high speed. Numerous facts have proved that wherever the leader's position is not firm, the thinking is backward, the energy is insufficient, and the style is not in-depth, it will inevitably affect the areas and departments under their leadership, and the work will not improve; on the contrary, wherever the position is firm, the thinking is advanced, the energy is sufficient, and the style is in-depth, the work under their leadership is full of vigor and a great leap forward atmosphere. The above two kinds of thinking, two kinds of energy, and two kinds of style form two completely different work contrasts. Therefore, to resolve the contradiction between advanced and backward, we must be determined to improve the work level and leadership level of the financial and trade departments.

To further improve the work level and leadership level of the financial and trade departments, the central link is to strengthen the serious study of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's works by cadres at all levels of financial and trade. Mao Zedong's works have creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, and are the model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. A comprehensive and systematic study of Mao Zedong's works is of decisive significance for improving leadership level. Therefore, we have decided to launch a deep and extensive movement to study Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's works among the broad masses of financial and trade cadres. And first ensure that leading cadres above the county, bureau, and bank president level will conscientiously learn well in the next two or three years.

To further improve the leadership level of financial and trade work, we must also conscientiously implement the Party's mass line and earnestly improve the leadership methods. To implement the mass line in financial and trade departments, we must first strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, let go of mobilizing the masses, and engage in mass movements on a large scale. Our principle is that putting politics in command is first, material interests are second, and second, we must combine political work with economic work, combine business work with mass work, and combine departmental work with industrial and agricultural production. And closely around the central work of the Party and the government, earnestly serve the central work, and be good at finding out the tasks that the departmental work should undertake from the central work, so that the departmental work can be jointly developed and jointly leap forward under the unified arrangement of the party committee and the government. In terms of leadership methods, we must continue to adhere to the leadership method of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," and at the same time conscientiously summarize and apply the leadership methods of the mass line that have been further developed and effective since the Great Leap Forward. For example, learn to use the method of grasping with both hands, and put forward a new task when a task has not yet been completed, so that in the process of completing the previous task, we can prepare for the next task. Another example is the method of setting up pacesetters, establishing banners, grasping both ends and bringing the middle, as well as summarizing experience in a timely manner, holding on-site meetings, organizing visits to exhibitions, etc. All these effective leadership methods are the concrete application and development of the Party's mass line. In future work, we must continue to implement them vigorously.

To further improve the leadership level of financial and trade work, we must also launch a mass movement of learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping in the financial and trade system to establish lofty ambitions, set great goals, everyone be a pacesetter, and everyone strive for the red flag. We have decided to cultivate 30 red flag counties, 1,000 red flag communes, and 100,000 red flag hands in the financial and trade system of the province this year. Make each special (prefecture) have red flag counties, red flag cities, and red flag streets, and each county has red flag districts and red flag communes, set up more large areas of red flags, make the pacesetters become columns, the red flags become pieces, the experience become complete sets, and the competition become networks, to promote our work to continuously improve and jointly leap forward.

Comrades, as mentioned above, although the financial and trade work in our province has indeed made not small achievements, it has also encountered many difficulties, and it will definitely encounter difficulties in the future. As long as we continue to adhere to the road of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to speak and daring to do, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relying on the people of the province and the staff of the financial and trade system of the province, work with one heart, one mind, and one appearance, overcome all difficulties, and forge ahead bravely, we will definitely be able to bring the financial and trade work to a new level, complete and overfulfill the financial and trade work tasks for 1960, and promote the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy.

    把财贸工作提高到更好地为生产和生活服务的新阶段
    李大章代表谈四川省财贸工作的成就和经验
    我完全同意两位李副总理及谭副总理向大会所作的三个报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现仅就四川省财贸工作作如下发言。
    1959年，我省人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，向几十年所未有的严重自然灾害进行了英勇顽强的斗争，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，进行了反右倾，鼓干劲，保卫总路线的斗争和社会主义教育运动，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了整个国民经济持续跃进的伟大胜利。
    在工农业生产持续跃进的带动下，我省财贸工作也出现了持续跃进的新局面。这种跃进的新形势，不仅表现在以前所未有的速度超额完成了粮、棉、油等主要农产品的采购任务，作到了商品不断增多，物价稳定市场繁荣，而且在部分地区和部门还初步摸索到了一些促进工农业高速度发展的先进经验，为财贸工作的大发展开拓了广阔前进的道路。总结这些地区和部门的经验，最基本最主要的，可归纳以下二条。
    一、积极主动地参与生产，组织生产，千方百计地为促进生产高速度发展服务
    社会主义的商业、财政、银行部门，是国家组织分配物资和资金以保证不断扩大再生产的工具。因此，它们的首要任务就是为促进生产的高速度发展服务。但是，对于这个明显而重大的问题，在我省一些财贸部门中，长期以来并未获得解决。他们不是把90％的精力和时间，放在支援工农业生产上，而是停留在“等客上门，收收支支”的单纯业务圈子里，因而工作经常处于忙乱被动状态。工农业生产的大跃进，促使财贸部门干部的思想大大解放，增加了干劲，终于使得他们走出了办公室，开始找到为生产服务的门径，他们在党和政府的领导下，参加生产，组织生产，并千方百计地为生产服务。
    我省财贸部门的参与生产，首先是从商业部门开始的，以后逐步发展到财政、银行和粮食部门。财贸部门参加生产发展过程并不是一帆风顺的，它经过了一系列的斗争；财贸部门参加生产，不仅已经摆脱了“打打算算”的单纯业务圈子，而且已经纠正和正在纠正那种认为参加生产只是为了完成部门任务的观点。这是财贸工作的一项重大变革，它为今后财贸工作的发展和继续跃进找到一条非常宽广的道路。凡是走上这条道路的部门和单位，他们的工作就立刻改观，大有起色，路子越走越宽阔，工作越作越起劲。我省梁平、武胜、江油、遂宁等县财贸部门的工作，正是沿着这条道路不断前进的，他们作出了比较显著的成绩，也取得了一些先进经验。
    梁平县商业部门，自去年以来，就积极组织干部深入公社，参与公社的生产规划，大力帮助公社发展多种经营，大办社办工业。在去年一年中他们与人民公社、生产大队签订各种结合合同四千五百多份，并在年底全部超额完成了任务，大大支援了工农业生产的发展。当去年该县发生严重的旱灾时，商业部门把抗旱斗争当成是自己部门的中心任务，与全县农民一起，同甘共苦，车水灌田，及时供应各种灌溉工具，积极组织干部购运晚秋作物种子，因而胜利地完成了抢种，补种晚秋作物三十多万亩，蔬菜二十六万多亩的任务。江油县的财政、银行部门，为了使发放农贷真正走在春耕生产的前面，起到更好支援生产的作用，他们在春耕生产前就主动地对人民公社、生产大队现有多少生产资料，还缺多少生产资料，商业部门能供应多少生产资料等，逐一调查清楚，然后把生产资料、贷款等主动地送上门去；与此同时，还积极帮助公社大办农具厂、农药厂、肥料厂、饲料厂等；并积极组织群众修补农具，教育群众爱护农具和其他公共财产。这样，在县委和县人委的领导下，很快就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的有机关、工厂、学校、城镇干部、工人、学生、居民等参加的送肥运动和大办“四厂”运动，解决了生产资料不足的困难，从而迅速地把春耕生产推向新的高潮。江油银行把这一从参加生产、组织生产到为生产服务的发展过程，总结为十四个字，即叫作“一查、二送、三制造和制（造）、修（理）、补（缺）、爱（护）四结合”。粮食部门，过去一向被人们认为是只管粮食不管生产的，可是在大跃进中，武胜县沿口粮站却打破了这个常规。他们在全体粮站职工中开展了“为谁服务”的大辩论，进行了总路线和政治、生产、群众三大观点的教育。使粮食干部也走出了仓库，参加了农业生产，参加了粮食的收、打、晒工作。去年一年，全站职工作了一千六百个劳动日，帮助公社积肥造肥二百四十八万斤。不仅如此，他们还把粮食的管理工作，由过去只管国家粮食进而把公社、生产大队的口粮、饲料、种子和储备粮等一竿子到底地全部而又分别地管起来。这是财贸工作的一个新的创举。这样一来，在粮食战线上也出现了生气勃勃的新局面。特别值得提出的是，财贸部门在参加生产和支援生产时，还进行了支援穷队赶富队的工作，这对于促进人民公社的巩固和发展，起了积极的作用。如江油县银行干部以穷队为家，满腔热情地大力支援穷队赶富队。在工作中他们创造了“三同”（同吃、同住、同劳动）、“四包”（包贷款发放好，包资金统筹安排使用好，包生产计划要实现，包收入赶上当地的一般水平）、“一竿到底”（扶持穷队以赶上富队为止）的办法，终于使二十五个穷队在不长的时间内基本上赶上富队。武胜县沿口粮站在支援穷队赶富队的工作中，提出了“‘帮’（就是帮助穷队制定生产规划，帮助穷队大办工厂），‘挖’（就是挖掘人力、物力、财力，自力更生，发展生产）‘查’（就是检查计划，检查生产，发现问题，及时反映，及时解决）、‘援’（就是给予人力、物力和技术的援助）四结合，定把穷队赶富队”的战斗口号。在这一战斗口号的鼓舞下，经过一年来的艰苦工作，终于使他们所帮助的穷队赶上了富队。
    总结我省财贸部门参与生产、组织生产和积极为生产服务的一些共同经验是：（一）把生产部门的工作，当成自己的工作，处处从生产出发，事事为生产着想，千方百计地为生产服务；（二）把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，与生产部门同呼吸，共命运，和群众同吃同住同劳动；（三）财贸工作，特别是生产资料和资金的分配工作必须作到走在生产的前面。
    但是，对于财贸部门必须积极参与生产，组织生产和为生产服务的问题，并不是一开始在认识上就是一致的，实际上是存在着两种不
  同思想和两种不同作法的，即：一种是从生产
  出发，积极参加生产，通过业务活动为生产服务，促进生产的发展；另一种是从业务出发，也参加生产，但主要是为完成部门的任务服务。前者是符合党中央和毛主席关于发展经济，保证供给，以90％的力量发展生产，以10％的力量取得增加财政收入的思想和方针；后者则是违反了上述思想和方针的。凡是有前一种思想和执行前一种方针的，工作都出现了新的局面。
  凡是存在着后一种思想和执行后一种方针的，工作都作得不好。由此可见，财贸部门参加生产，组织生产和积极为生产服务，绝不是什么一般性质的问题，而是能否做好财贸工作带有根本性质的问题。
      二、积极组织和参与城乡人民经济生活
    财贸部门的工作，是密切联系着广大人民群众的生产和生活的。广泛组织人民经济生活，是社会主义建设高速度发展和城乡人民公社化后，向财贸部门提出来的新任务。为着适应这种新情况，这就要求财贸部门必须自觉、主动地把广泛组织人民经济生活这一新的历史任务担负起来。我省自1958年大跃进以来，各级财贸部门在当地党委和政府的领导下，从组织生产入手，并结合农村的人民公社化，首先是大力协助举办农村公共食堂。一年多的实践证明，大力举办和办好公共食堂，不仅可以使广大社员节约时间，出工整齐，大大地提高劳动生产率，有利于促进生产的发展，而且可以通过集体劳动和集体生活，提高社员的集体主义思想和社会主义觉悟，使公共食堂既成为组织社员生产和生活的中心，又成为有利于向社员进行政治文化教育的场所。因此，省委和省人委对于大力举办公共食堂，始终是采取了坚持“只准办好，不准办坏”的方针。并在组织领导上，决定各级党委都有一个书记挂帅，并成立生活福利委员会和办公室专门负责这一工作。在粮食供应的方针上，采取了“以人定量，分配口粮，食堂吃饭，节余自得”的办法。经过去年一年的实践，全省五十五万五千多个公共食堂中，其中极少数，虽然在党的八届八中全会前的一个短时期内，被党内右倾机会主义分子所解散，但很快又被群众自动地恢复起来，现在已有98％以上的食堂被坚持和巩固下来了。正是由于我们坚持了人民公社，坚持了公共食堂，才有力地战胜了我省去年三十多年来未有的大旱灾，使所有参加食堂的人的口粮供应都得到了保证，并从而保护了群众的生产热情和冲天干劲，使得1959年的粮食产量，仍在1958年特大丰收的基础上增产7％，这与解放前遭到严重灾荒即会出现的赤地千里、四处逃荒的凄凉景象形成了强烈的对照。
    今年以来，省委又进一步地要求全省各地，结合春耕生产，大抓春菜生产，大力发展生猪，并进一步地建立和健全公共食堂的经营管理制度等等，这就为进一步发展和巩固人民公社，进一步安排好社员生活，和继续提高广大社员的劳动热情创造了极为有利的条件。这里值得指出的是，在大办公共食堂中，财贸部门是主动地作了许多工作的，而且在不少地区，也开始获得了成绩，取得了比较丰富的经验。如武胜县沿口粮站的干部，以食堂为家，采取与社员同吃同住同劳动的办法，大搞试验田，取得了“三抓一改”的经验，即：（一）大抓种菜养猪。他们首先是帮助公社进行生产规划，然后发动群众利用田边、地角、房前房后，山湾塘埂等大搞种菜运动。因为菜种得多，猪也就容易发展，现在他们已帮助公社种菜一千七百多亩，养猪二万四千五百二十头，平均每人一头；（二）大抓计划用粮。除了完成国家粮食征购任务外，使种子、饲料、口粮等各有所属，专粮专用；（三）大抓食堂的民主管理。选拔成分好，觉悟高，热心服务，大公无私的人来担任管理人员和炊事人员，并成立食堂管理委员会，建立粮食收支保管的制度，定期公布账目，把食堂置于群众的督促之下。“一改”，即改革炊事工具，开办炊事员训练班，帮助食堂普遍安装“土自来水”，制造了切片、切丝、切块和洗菜机等共十一种，四百六十七件，节省了五万多个劳动日，受到广大群众和炊事员的热烈欢迎，他们说：“如今十化好，隔壁连锅灶，洗菜不用手，切菜不用刀”。
    组织人民经济生活，不仅在农村已经积累了比较丰富的经验，而且在城市也初步摸索了一些前进的途径。如重庆上新街商业部门，在党委和政府的统一领导下，依靠群众，协作各方，开展了一个广泛组织人民经济生活的群众运动，帮助群众把吃、穿、用以及家务劳动中的各种琐事都进行了全面的安排和妥善的解决。这条街已经基本上实现了“三网”（集体食堂网、托儿所网、生活服务网）“一化”（生产集体化）。居民的生活面貌已大为改观，生产劲头越发高涨，真正是出现了“户户忙生产，家家无闲人”的新风尚。这种新的面貌和新的风尚的出现，实际是彻底改造过去旧的消费城市为新的生产城市的开端。综合这条街商业部门组织人民经济生活的经验是：（一）合理地分配商品。这条街有一个营业员能比较确切地了解一千户中四千多人的各种不同消费和需要情况，并据此进行商品供应和分配，这是一种新的分配方法。（二）大办各种集体福利事业，其中主要是集中力量办好集体食堂。作到每日三餐中一稀两干，中午晚上两菜一汤，使居民吃饱吃好。（三）从组织居民参加生产中来开展经济生活的互助合作和自我服务运动。特别值得注意的是，重庆郭家坨在街道居民中，普遍成立了万能服务部，这个服务部，包揽服务项目一百八十一种。从群众的寄卖、代买、代办、修配、出租、家庭服务、接送病人一直到婚丧嫁娶，无所不包，无所不揽。因此，群众称之为万能服务部。万能服务部是群众性的自我服务组织，办事迅速、便利群众。不收钱或收少许的钱，大受群众欢迎。
    根据以上所讲，可以看出，组织人民经济生活不但为生产大跃进所必需，不但有积极的经济意义，同时也有重大的政治意义。因为组织人民经济生活，可以使财贸工作人员更加深入群众，了解群众的情况和需要，这是党的群众路线在财贸部门工作中的进一步发展。密切党和群众这种联系，可以改变人们的精神面貌和人与人之间的关系，大兴共产主义的协作之风，有利社会主义生产建设的高速度的发展。总之，组织人民经济生活，是社会主义比较完善的一种新的分配形式，可以预料，随着国家建设的迅速发展，必将越来越显示出这一种新的分配形式的巨大优越性。
    但是，对于以上这一新的历史任务和它的重大意义，并未为我们所有财贸战线的干部所完全理解和接受。如有人认为，根据城乡和各人不同要求而进行合理地分配商品和主动地送货上门，是“多管闲事”，大力举办公共食堂和积极组织集体福利和服务事业是“不务正业”。以上种种思想，实质上是反映了他们对新生事物的熟视无睹，他们的思想实际仍然停留在人民公社化以前的旧阶段，因此他们就不可能看到：过去以一家一户为生产和生活单位的旧时代，已经为数十家、数百家、数千家为单位的集体生产和集体生活方式的新时代所代替了。
    社会生产方式的不断向前发展，必然要求有新的生活方式与之相适应。城乡人民公社的建立、发展和巩固，人们生产和生活集体化的程度是在日益提高。特别是广大妇女在摆脱家务劳动而参加社会集体劳动之后，她们更是迫切地要求大力举办公共食堂和集体福利事业。在这种情况下，如果我们还是采取过去的只管生产，不管生活的办法，或者只管个人生活，不管集体生活并把集体生活管好，就会造成生产和生活的脱节，阻碍生产的发展。而这一种必须把集体生产和集体生活组织好、领导好，正是目前党的阶级路线在生产和生活工作的具体反映。为着高速度发展生产，因而必须加强和扩大集体生产和集体生活的比重，是完全符合于广大劳动人民的阶级利益的。如在农村进行大规模的集体生产以后，而我们不办或不办好公共食堂，这就不仅影响一个劳动人民的利益，而是影响几百几千几万劳动人民的利益，同样，不办托儿所，或不办好托儿所，这不仅会影响几十、几百个劳动人民孩子的身体健康，而且会影响几十、几百个孩子的父母不能安心生产。这是对于劳动人民的阶级利益不利的。
    由此可见，组织人民经济生活，绝不是“不务正业”，“多管闲事”，而是必务之业，必管之事，是大势所趋，势在必行，一定要把人民的经济生活广泛地组织起来，而且一定要组织好。
    以上一些为群众所创造而又行之有效的经验，急须在我省普遍地推广，并且不断加以充实和发展，使财贸工作更好为生产和生活服务，特别是必须大力支援农业的高速度发展更是当前最紧急的任务。为要达到以上的目的，一定要把目前我们所有财贸部门的工作水平和领导水平，普遍进一步地提高起来。
    在同样的条件下，为什么我们有一些财贸部门的工作一直走在前面，而另一些却总是落在后面呢？归根结底，我们认为主要原因在于领导。在广大城乡基层领导干部中，除了个别的由于他们坚持资产阶级立场，反对总路线、大跃进和人民公社，使得工作无法做好以外，另外一些地区和部门，他们的工作之所以长期无甚进展和无甚起色的原因，主要是由于对目前大好形势认识不足，缺乏干劲和高速度建设社会主义的思想。无数的事实证明：凡是领导人立场不坚定，思想落后，干劲不足，作风不深入的，必然就会影响他们所领导的地区和部门，工作无起色；反之，凡是立场坚定，思想先进，干劲十足，作风深入的，他们所领导的工作就是朝气蓬勃，一片大跃进的气象。以上这两种思想，两种干劲，和两种作风，形成两种截然不同的工作对比。因此，解决先进与落后的矛盾，必须下定决心提高财贸部门的工作水平和领导水平。
    进一步提高财贸部门的工作水平和领导水平，中心环节是在必须加强各级财贸干部对毛泽东思想和毛泽东著作的认真学习，毛泽东著作是创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的典范。全面系统的学习毛泽东著作，对于提高领导水平有决定性的意义。因此，我们决定在广大财贸干部中，开展一个深入广泛地学习毛泽东思想和毛泽东著作的运动。并首先保证县、局、行长以上的领导干部，在今后两三年内切实学好。
    要进一步提高财贸工作的领导水平，还必须认真贯彻执行党的群众路线，切实改进领导方法。财贸部门贯彻群众路线，首先是必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。我们的原则是，政治挂帅第一，物质利益第二，其次是必须把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，把业务工作和群众工作结合起来，把部门工作和工农业生产结合起来。并紧紧围绕党和政府的中心工作，切实为中心工作服务，并善于从中心工作中找出部门工作应该担负的任务，使部门工作在党委和政府的统筹安排下，得到共同发展和共同跃进。在领导方法方面，必须继续坚持“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的领导方法，同时认真总结和运用大跃进以来各地所进一步发展起来并行之有效的群众路线的领导方法。例如学会用两只手抓的方法，在一个任务尚未完结的时候，就提出一个新的任务，使在完成前一个任务的过程中，就为后一个任务作好准备。又如树标兵，立旗帜，抓两头带中间的方法，以及及时总结经验，召开现场会议，组织参观展览等等，所有这些已见成效的领导方法，都是党的群众路线的具体运用和发展。在今后工作中必须大力继续贯彻执行。
    要进一步提高财贸工作的领导水平，还必须在财贸系统中发起一个树雄心、立大志，人人当标兵，个个争红旗的学、赶、超、帮的群众运动。我们决定今年在全省财贸系统中培养三十个红旗县；一千个红旗公社；十万个红旗手。使每个专（州）都要有红旗县、红旗市、红旗街，每个县都有红旗区、红旗公社，树立起更多的大面积的红旗，使标兵成列，红旗成片，经验成套，竞赛成网，以推动我们的工作不断提高，共同跃进。
    各位代表，以上所讲，我省的财贸工作虽然确实已经取得了不小的成绩，但也遇到了不少的困难，而且今后肯定还会遇到困难，只要我们继续坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社的道路，继续发扬敢说敢干的共产主义风格，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，依靠全省人民和全省财贸系统的职工，一条心、一股劲、一个样地工作，排除万难，奋勇前进，我们就一定能够把财贸工作提到一个新的水平，完成和超额完成1960年的财贸工作任务，促进国民经济高速度按比例的发展。
