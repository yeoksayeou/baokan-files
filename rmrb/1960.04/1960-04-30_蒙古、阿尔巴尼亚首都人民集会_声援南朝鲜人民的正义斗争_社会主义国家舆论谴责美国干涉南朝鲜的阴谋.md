Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: People in Mongolia and Albania have been holding rallies in support of the just struggle of the South Korean people.

On the afternoon of April 29th, people from all walks of life in Mongolia held a rally at the Trade Union Building to support the just struggle of the South Korean people and solemnly demanded that the troops of U.S. imperialism immediately withdraw from South Korea.

The rally was organized by five mass organizations, including the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Asian-African Solidarity Committee.

Damdinsuren, Chairman of the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace, said at the meeting that the Korean people have every right to handle their own destiny without foreign interference. U.S. troops should withdraw from South Korea immediately. He said that the events in South Korea were caused by the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism, and U.S. imperialism must be held responsible for this event.

Liu Chengjin, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Mongolia, was invited to speak at the meeting. He said that the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland will surely be victorious. The meeting concluded with the reading of a statement by the five organizations. The statement said that the Mongolian people express their support for the Korean people's struggle and stand in solidarity with them.

Mass rallies were also held in the Mongolian Industrial United Factory, Mongolian National University, Ulaanbaatar Thermal Power Plant, and other enterprises and institutions of the Mongolian People's Republic to support the South Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland and for a free and happy life.

Youth workers and students in Tirana, the capital of Albania, held a rally on the 27th to support the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee regime.

Korean students studying at the National University of Tirana and Fang Heshou, First Secretary of the Korean Embassy in Albania, were also invited to attend the conference. The secretary of the Tirana Municipal Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League made a report on the struggle of South Korean youth against the Syngman Rhee gang and American colonialists for justice, freedom and democracy. He stressed that Albanian youth "stand in solidarity with Korean youth and resolutely protest the crimes of the Syngman Rhee clique."

The conference also passed a telegram of protest to the South Korean authorities, solemnly condemning the South Korean authorities' acts of terror.

This newspaper comprehensively reports: Newspapers in socialist countries continue to publish articles supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people and exposing the U.S. conspiracy to intensify interference in the South Korean situation.

The Soviet "Red Star" said in a commentary on the 29th that the downfall of the hateful dictator Syngman Rhee is a great victory for the South Korean patriots, and we have every reason to be happy about this victory.

The commentary pointed out that although Syngman Rhee has stepped down, his system remains. Fearing the righteous indignation of the people of the world, Washington has now adopted such a trick: advising Syngman Rhee to resign and replacing him with another running dog of the occupiers.

The commentary said that Syngman Rhee's replacement, Heo Jeong, has openly declared that he will establish closer military and economic ties with the United States. There is no doubt that the tense situation in South Korea will not end as long as the root cause of the people's anger is not eliminated.

The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" commented on the 28th that the South Korean people's bloody struggle is not for replacing Syngman Rhee and letting another person continue to implement harmful pro-American policies. The South Korean people will only end the struggle after they have won true freedom and independence.

The "New Germany" pointed out on the 28th that the division of Korea prominently demonstrates the similarities between the policies of Syngman Rhee and Adenauer. Syngman Rhee has openly stated on many occasions that he will take new offensives against North Korea and believes that delaying this offensive will only make North Korea more consolidated. The commentary said that this is exactly Adenauer's point of view.

The Romanian "Spark" published an article saying that the collapse of Syngman Rhee is the inevitable end of any puppet in our era who sells himself to the imperialist bloc and relies on foreign bayonets to maintain his regime; it is also a great failure of the "policy of strength" and the policy of creating international tension. The article said that the lessons of the South Korean incident clearly show that the dollar cannot turn checks into slabs of stone that suppress the torrent of anger of the oppressed people and their fervent desire for peace, freedom, and social progress.

The Hungarian "People's Liberty" published an editorial saying that the downfall of Syngman Rhee is a disastrous defeat for the U.S. policy in the Far East (and not only in the Far East). At present, the United States is attempting to use the methods of shirking responsibility and misleading the South Korean people to regain control of the South Korean regime in the hands of Washington's puppets.

The Polish "Warsaw Life" published a commentary saying that the outbreak of the South Korean people's discontent has shown the political groups in Washington that the U.S. policy of supporting a regime hated by the entire people will sooner or later go bankrupt.

    蒙古、阿尔巴尼亚首都人民集会
    声援南朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    社会主义国家舆论谴责美国干涉南朝鲜的阴谋
    新华社29日讯　蒙古和阿尔巴尼亚人民纷纷举行集会，支援南朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    蒙古各界人民29日下午在工会大厦举行集会，支持南朝鲜人民的正义斗争，并严正要求美帝国主义的军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    这个集会是由蒙古保卫和平委员会、亚非团结委员会等五个群众团体组织的。
    蒙古保卫和平委员会主席达木丁苏伦在会上讲话说，朝鲜人民完全有权在没有外国干涉的情况下处理自己命运的问题。美国军队应立即撤出南朝鲜。他说，在南朝鲜发生的事件是美帝国主义的侵略政策造成的，美帝国主义必须对这一事件负责。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻蒙古大使馆临时代办柳诚进应邀到会讲话，他说，朝鲜人民争取统一祖国的斗争一定获得胜利。会议最后宣读了五个团体的声明。声明说，蒙古人民表示支持朝鲜人民的斗争，并和他们团结一致。
    在蒙古工业联合工厂、蒙古国立大学、乌兰巴托热电站以及蒙古人民共和国其它企业和机关也都举行了群众大会，声援南朝鲜人民为争取祖国统一、争取自由和幸福生活的斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那的青年工人和学生27日举行集会，支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚制度的斗争。
    在国立地拉那大学学习的朝鲜留学生和朝鲜驻阿大使馆一等秘书方鹤寿也应邀出席了大会。阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟地拉那市委员会书记在会上作了关于南朝鲜青年反对李承晚匪帮和美国殖民主义者，争取正义自由和民主的斗争的报告。他强调说，阿尔巴尼亚青年“和朝鲜青年团结在一起，坚决抗议李承晚集团的罪行。
    大会并通过给南朝鲜当局的抗议电报，严正谴责南朝鲜当局的恐怖罪行。
    本报综合报道　社会主义国家的报纸继续发表文章，支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，并揭露了美国加紧干涉南朝鲜局势的阴谋。
    苏联“红星报”29日在一篇评论中说，令人憎恨的独裁者李承晚的垮台是南朝鲜爱国者的巨大胜利，我们有一切理由为这个胜利感到高兴。
    评论指出，李承晚虽然下台了，他的制度却仍然保留了下来。由于害怕全世界人民的义愤，华盛顿这次采取了这样的手腕：劝告李承晚辞职，而使另外一个占领者的走狗来取代他的位置。
    评论说，代替李承晚的许政已经公然宣布要同美国建立更加紧密的军事和经济联系。毫无疑问，激起人民愤怒的根本原因一天不消除，南朝鲜的紧张局势就一天不能结束。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”28日的评论说，南朝鲜人民流血斗争不是为了撤换李承晚、而让另一个人来继续执行有害的亲美政策。南朝鲜人民只有在争得了真正的自由和独立以后才会结束斗争。
    “新德意志报”28日指出，朝鲜的分裂突出地表明了李承晚和阿登纳政策的相似之处。李承晚曾在很多场合公开表示过将对朝鲜北部采取新的攻势，并认为延缓这种攻势只会使北朝鲜更加巩固。评论说，这也正是阿登纳的观点。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”发表文章说，李承晚的垮台是我们时代任何卖身投靠帝国主义集团和依靠外国刺刀维持政权的傀儡的不可避免的结局；也是“实力政策”和制造国际紧张局势政策的巨大失败。文章说，南朝鲜事件的教训清楚地说明，美元不能使支票变成镇压被压迫人民的怒潮和他们对和平、自由、社会进步的热切愿望的大石板。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”发表社论说，李承晚的垮台是美国的政策在远东（而且不仅是在远东）的惨败。目前，美国正企图利用推卸责任和把南朝鲜人民引入迷途的方法，来重新把南朝鲜政权掌握在华盛顿的傀儡的手中。
    波兰“华沙生活报”发表评论说，南朝鲜人民不满情绪的爆发向华盛顿的政治集团表明，美国支持遭到全体人民仇视的制度的政策，迟早都要破产。
