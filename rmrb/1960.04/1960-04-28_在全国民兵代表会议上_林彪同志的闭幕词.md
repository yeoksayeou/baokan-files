At the National Militia Representatives Conference
Comrade Lin Biao's Closing Speech

Comrades:

The National Militia Representatives Conference has victoriously concluded today.

This conference has been very successful. During the ten days of the conference, everyone listened to many important reports and typical speeches, held discussions, exchanged experiences, and learned a lot. We have furthered our understanding of Chairman Mao's idea of "everyone a soldier" and the strategic position of the militia. Through this conference, we are confident that we will be able to further strengthen militia building, enhance national defense strength, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of militiamen to greatly promote the sustained leap forward of the national economy.

As everyone knows, old China was a country that had long been bullied by imperialism. From 1840 to 1937, our country suffered seven armed invasions by imperialists. Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism colluded with each other, riding roughshod over the Chinese people, running amok, and making our country extremely poor. The broad masses of the Chinese people suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation, living a life worse than that of beasts of burden. In order to overthrow the reactionary rule of domestic and foreign enemies, the Chinese people waged a heroic struggle for more than a century, advancing wave upon wave, undaunted by sacrifice. Finally, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we overthrew the three great enemies and won the great victory of the people's revolution.

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have victoriously carried out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, overcome the famine, unemployment, ignorance and other phenomena left over from old China, and forever ended the history of the class exploitation system that had lasted for thousands of years. We are now marching forward towards a bright socialist future. In particular, since 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, we have continuously achieved great leaps forward in production, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years. A vibrant and prosperous new atmosphere prevails throughout the country. Now, the Chinese people are advancing courageously on the basis of victory, with greater revolutionary vigor and at a high speed of "one day equals twenty years," to build our country into a strong socialist country that has modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense.

Developing the socialist cause at a high speed is the urgent desire and glorious responsibility of the people of the whole country. We are a country with vast land and abundant resources, a large population, and a favorable climate. We have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and we have the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We also have the assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, our socialist construction not only needs to be carried out at a high speed, but it is also entirely possible to achieve a high speed.

Socialist economic construction is the material basis of national defense construction. The national defense issue is essentially a matter of strength. National defense strength is a comprehensive manifestation of a country's political, economic, scientific and technological strength. When analyzing the relationship between national defense construction and economic construction, Chairman Mao asked us to concentrate all possible forces to develop socialist economic construction at a high speed, to realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and to fundamentally strengthen national defense construction and realize national defense modernization. In recent years, following Chairman Mao's instructions, we have correctly handled the relationship between economic construction and national defense construction, accelerating both economic construction and enhancing national defense strength. Practice has proven that the path indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the only correct path that combines Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China.

At present, not only is the domestic situation very good, but the international situation is also very good. The general trend of the world is that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, becoming increasingly favorable to world peace and increasingly favorable to the socialist camp. Under this situation, U.S. imperialism has been forced to make certain gestures of relaxation. This is the result of the struggle of the people of the world against war and for peace. However, U.S. imperialism's certain gestures of relaxation are not, and will never be, a change in the fundamental policy of the United States. In fact, U.S. imperialism has been stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, actively carrying out aggressive activities. From September last year to April 20 this year alone, there have been as many as thirty-five instances of war clamors and expanded aggression. U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan. From October last year to now, U.S. imperialism has violated our territorial waters and airspace as many as twenty-one times. On March 16 this year, 50,000 U.S. troops and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. All this fully exposes that U.S. imperialism's so-called "peace" is nothing but a deceptive trick. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against this. We are for peace and against wars of aggression. However, if imperialism insists on imposing war on us, we will use revolutionary war to eliminate counter-revolutionary war and win lasting peace for mankind.

Imperialism is desperately preparing for a large-scale missile and nuclear weapons war. To deal with this kind of war, the most important thing for us is to mobilize the people, rely on the people, and implement people's war. We are Marxist-Leninists, and we affirm that people are the decisive factor in war, but we also recognize that modern technology plays an important role in war. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to vigorously improve the technical equipment of our army and strengthen the modernization of our army. We have now built a strong regular army. With the rapid development of the entire national economy and culture and science, our army is climbing the peak of military science and technology. However, building a strong regular army with modern and latest technical equipment is only one aspect of our national defense construction; another aspect, which is also very important, is to strengthen militia building, vigorously run militia divisions, and implement "everyone a soldier." Combining the building of a modern revolutionary army with the vigorous running of militia divisions is the concrete application of the "walking on two legs" policy in national defense construction, and it is a major development of Chairman Mao's thinking on people's war under modern conditions. Arming hundreds of millions of people ideologically, organizationally, and militarily, actively carrying out military and political training and national defense sports, and building a powerful people's armed force that is energetic, physically strong, and has both a high degree of political consciousness and a certain military literacy, is an important strategic task for our country in national defense construction.

Vigorously running militia divisions and implementing "everyone a soldier" is not only of extremely great significance for strengthening national defense construction, but also has an immeasurable role in accelerating socialist economic construction. Because hundreds of millions of militiamen are an industrial army full of energy and the strongest labor force in the whole people. In recent years, they have made brilliant achievements on all fronts of socialist construction. Now, the central task of the national militia is to devote all its efforts to socialist construction. It is hoped that all the representatives present at the meeting will, with their exemplary actions, lead hundreds of millions of militiamen to actively participate in various socialist constructions; on the road to socialism, continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and bravely move forward, contributing all their wisdom and strength to building our country into a strong socialist country, and striving to realize the lofty ideal of communism.

Comrades! You will soon return to your respective fighting posts. It is hoped that you will give full play to your role as backbone, leader, and bridge, widely publicize the spirit of the meeting, and more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of militiamen. Under the leadership of the Party, hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and muster greater revolutionary vigor to strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and to implement the policy of "everyone a soldier," constantly enhancing national defense strength, and advancing bravely. The great Chinese people under the banner of Mao Zedong will surely be able to overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and move from victory to greater victory.

### 在全国民兵代表会议上  林彪同志的闭幕词

    在全国民兵代表会议上
    林彪同志的闭幕词同志们：
    全国民兵代表会议，今天胜利地闭幕了。
    这次会议开得很好。在十天的会议中，大家听了许多重要报告和典型发言，进行了讨论，交流了经验，学了很多东西；对于毛主席全民皆兵的思想和民兵的战略地位，有了进一步的认识。通过这次会议，我们相信：一定能够进一步加强民兵建设，增强国防力量；一定能够进一步调动亿万民兵的积极性，大大地促进国民经济的持续跃进。
    大家都知道，旧中国是一个长期受帝国主义欺负的国家。从1840年到1937年，我国就遭到帝国主义者的七次武装侵略。帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，互相勾结，骑在中国人民的头上，横行霸道，把我国弄得贫困不堪，广大中国人民受尽种种压迫和剥削，过着牛马不如的生活。我国人民为了打倒国内外敌人的反动统治，百余年来，曾经进行了前仆后继、不屈不挠的英勇斗争。终于在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，打倒了三大敌人，赢得了人民革命的伟大胜利。
    解放以来，我国人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，胜利地进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，克服了旧中国遗留下来的饥荒、失业、愚昧等现象，永远结束了几千年来的阶级剥削制度的历史，正在阔步迈向美好的社会主义。特别是1958年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，连续实现了生产大跃进，以两年的时间，完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。全国到处呈现着一片繁荣、兴旺的新气象。现在，我国人民正在胜利的基础上，以更大的革命干劲，以“一天等于二十年”的高速度，为把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国而奋勇前进。
    高速度地发展社会主义事业，这是全国人民的迫切愿望，也是全国人民的光荣责任。我们是一个地大物博、人口众多、气候良好的国家，我们有毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导，有总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝；又有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的援助。因此，我国的社会主义建设，不但需要高速度而且也完全可能高速度。
    社会主义的经济建设，是国防建设的物质基础。国防问题，实质上是个力量问题。国防力量是国家政治力量、经济力量、科学技术力量的综合表现。毛主席在分析国防建设和经济建设的关系的时候，要求我们集中一切可能集中的力量，高速度地发展社会主义经济建设，实现工业农业和科学文化的现代化，从根本上加强国防建设，实现国防现代化。几年来，我们遵循毛主席的指示，正确处理了经济建设和国防建设的关系，既加速了经济建设，又增强了国防力量。实践证明：党中央和毛主席所指示的道路，是马克思列宁主义同中国具体实践相结合的唯一正确的道路。
    目前，不仅国内形势很好，国际形势也很好。世界总的形势是东风继续压倒西风，越来越有利于世界和平，越来越有利于社会主义阵营。在这种形势下，美帝国主义不得不被迫作出某些和缓的表示。这是世界人民反对战争、争取和平的斗争的结果。但是，美帝国主义的某些和缓的表示，并不是、也绝不会是美国根本政策的改变。事实上，美帝国主义一直是在加紧扩军备战，积极进行侵略活动，仅从去年9月到今年4月20日止，他们发出的战争叫嚣和扩大侵略的事实，就有三十五条之多。美帝国主义至今仍霸占我国的领土台湾。从去年10月到现在，美帝国主义侵犯我国领海领空即达二十一次。今年3月16日美军五万人和蒋介石集团，在我国台湾海峡又举行大规模的军事演习。这一切都充分暴露了美帝国主义所谓“和平”，只不过是一个骗局。对此，我们不能不保持高度的警惕。我们是坚持和平，反对侵略战争的。但是，如果帝国主义一定要把战争强加在我们头上，我们就用革命的战争消灭反革命的战争，赢得人类的永久和平。
    帝国主义正在拼命准备大规模的导弹和核武器的战争。我们对付这种战争，最主要的就是要动员人民、依靠人民、实行人民战争。我们是马克思列宁主义者，我们确认人是战争的决定因素，但同时也承认现代技术在战争中具有重要的作用。所以，我们必须抓紧时机，大力改善我军技术装备和加强我军现代化建设。我们现在已经建成了一支强大的正规军。随着整个国民经济和文化科学的飞跃发展，我们的军队正在攀登军事科学技术的高峰。但是，建设一支强大的具有现代最新技术装备的正规军，这只是我国国防建设的一个方面；另一方面，又是非常重要的方面，就是要加强民兵建设，大办民兵师，实行全民皆兵。把建设现代化革命军队和大办民兵师结合起来，这是“两条腿走路”的方针在国防建设上的具体运用，是毛主席人民战争思想在现代条件下的重大发展。把亿万人民从思想上组织上武装起来，积极开展军事、政治训练和国防体育运动，建设成为一支干劲充沛、体格健强、既有高度政治觉悟、又有一定军事素养的强大的人民武装力量，这是我们国家在国防建设上的一项重要战略任务。
    大办民兵师、实行全民皆兵，不仅对于加强国防建设具有极为重大的意义，而且，对于加速社会主义经济建设，也有着不可估量的作用。因为，亿万民兵是全民中精力充沛、劳动力最强的产业军。几年来，它在社会主义建设的各个战线上，都作出了辉煌的成就。现在，全国民兵的中心任务，就是要全力投入社会主义建设。希望到会的全体代表同志，以自己的模范行动，带领亿万民兵，积极参加社会主义各项建设；在向社会主义前进的道路上，继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，勇猛向前，贡献出自己的全部智慧和力量，为把我国建设成为强盛的社会主义国家，并为实现共产主义的崇高理想而奋斗。
    同志们！你们很快就要回到各自的战斗岗位。希望你们充分发挥骨干、带头和桥梁作用，广泛宣传会议精神，把亿万民兵的积极性，更加充分的动员起来，在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，鼓足更大的革命干劲，为完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要，为贯彻全民皆兵的方针，不断地增强国防力量，而奋勇前进。在毛泽东旗帜下的伟大的中国人民，一定能够克服前进道路上的任何困难，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
