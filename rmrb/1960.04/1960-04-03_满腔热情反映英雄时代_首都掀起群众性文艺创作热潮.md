	Filled with Enthusiasm Reflecting the Heroic Era
	A Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Upsurge Sweeps the Capital

	(Our report) A mass literary and artistic creation upsurge, centered on rapidly reflecting the heroic era of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, is emerging in the capital's professional literary and artistic units and amateur artistic organizations. The broad masses of professional and amateur authors are "vowing to sing the red flag with red hearts," using new achievements to greet the "May 1st" Labor Day.

	This mass creative upsurge is a continuation and development of the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and large-scale collaboration in Beijing's literary and artistic circles over the past two years. Its characteristics are: reflecting the newest and most moving events in our lives with full enthusiasm, and publicizing communist ideology and style; literary and artistic creation has both high speed and high quality; resolutely implementing the mass line, vigorously promoting the style of collaboration, mobilizing all positive factors, and twisting the enthusiasm of professional and amateur authors into a single rope.

	In the past month or two, relatively urgent and important themes in real life have been successively brought to the stage and screen in a very short period. Not long after the publication of the newsletter "Heroic Train" reporting the victory of the Train 12 between Beijing and Shenyang over the flood, the Experimental Drama Theater of the Central Academy of Drama, under the leadership of the Party committee, launched a mass creative movement and put it on the stage in more than twenty days. As soon as the newsletter "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" was published, the drama, ballad, and Ping opera stages in the capital performed this play in a short period of time; the script and comic strips of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" were also published successively; the Central Conservatory of Music timely created and performed a large chorus; and the Beijing Film Studio, with the vigorous assistance of all parties, shot it into a documentary art film in sixteen working days. Starting on the 30th of last month, this film was shown in more than 50 cinemas and clubs in Beijing, with every show fully booked. The Central Orchestra and the Ping Opera Troupe of the Ministry of Geology also adapted this event into a cantata and Ping opera, and took it to other places for touring performances.

	Not long ago, the four mixed chorus pieces "Long Live the People's Commune" created and performed by the student amateur creation group of the Renmin University of China aroused the attention of literary and artistic circles and all aspects in Beijing, and its ideological and artistic qualities reached a relatively high level. At present, many street residents' amateur art activity organizations are using various artistic forms to sing the praises of the great development of street production and the new atmosphere in people's economic life. The workers of the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory recently created and performed the majestic "Ode to the Leap Forward." The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory also created a large-scale dance drama "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" with the assistance of professional dance workers.

	In order to promote the healthier development of this literary and artistic creation movement, Beijing recently held an on-site meeting on literary and artistic creation to exchange the creative experience of the drama "Heroic Train." Beijing's literary and artistic units have already established links with relevant grassroots units such as municipal factories and mines and factory mines in various districts and counties, and people's communes, as fixed bases for literary and artistic workers' labor training, in-depth life, and guidance of mass cultural activities. Now, a group of creative cadres, directors, and actors have adopted various methods, such as long-term and short-term, to go deep into grassroots departments such as factories, rural areas, transportation, construction sites, and commerce to delve into life.

### 满腔热情反映英雄时代  首都掀起群众性文艺创作热潮

    满腔热情反映英雄时代
    首都掀起群众性文艺创作热潮
    本报讯　一个以迅速反映祖国大跃进英雄时代为中心的群众性文艺创作热潮，正在首都专业文艺单位和业余文艺组织中出现。广大专业和业余作者们“誓以红心唱红旗”，用新的成绩，迎接“五一”劳动节。
    这个群众性创作热潮是两年来北京文艺界大跃进、大协作精神的继续发扬。它的特点是：满腔热情地反映我们生活中最新最动人的事迹，宣扬共产主义思想和风格；文艺创作既有高速度，又有高质量；坚决贯彻执行群众路线，大兴协作之风，调动一切积极因素，把专业和业余作者的干劲拧成一股绳。
    一两个月来，现实生活中比较迫切、重大的主题，都在很短的时间内连续被搬上舞台和银幕。报道北京——沈阳间十二次列车战胜洪水的通讯“英雄列车”在报上发表不久，中央戏剧学院实验话剧院就在党委领导下展开了群众性创作运动，二十多天内把它搬上了舞台。“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的通讯一见报，在短期内，首都的话剧、曲艺、评剧舞台上就演出了这个戏；“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的剧本、连环画也相继出版；中央音乐学院及时创作演出了大合唱；北京电影制片厂在各方面大力协助下，用十六个工作日把它拍成了纪录性艺术影片，上月30日起这部影片就在北京五十多家电影院、俱乐部放映，场场客满。中央乐团、地质部文工团评剧队还把这个事件改编成清唱剧和评剧，带到外地巡回演出。
    不久以前，中国人民大学学生业余创作组创作演出的四部混声大合唱“人民公社万岁”，引起北京文艺界和各方面的重视，它的思想性、艺术性都达到相当高的水平。目前不少街道居民业余文艺活动组织正在用多种多样的文艺形式歌颂街道生产的大发展和人民经济生活中的新气象。北京第二棉纺织厂职工不久以前创作演出了气势雄伟的“跃进赞歌”。北京第一棉纺织厂职工也在专业舞蹈工作者协助下创作了大型舞剧“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”。
    为了推动这个文艺创作运动更健康地发展，北京最近举行了文艺创作现场会议，交流了话剧“英雄列车”的创作经验。北京各文艺单位已经同市属厂矿和各区县厂矿、人民公社等有关基层单位挂钩，作为文艺工作者劳动锻炼、深入生活辅导群众文化活动的固定基地。现在一批创作干部和导演、演员们已经采取长期、短期等多种方式，到工厂、农村、交通运输、工地、商业等基层部门深入生活。
