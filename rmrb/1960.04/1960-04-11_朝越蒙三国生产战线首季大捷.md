Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th April: Newspapers here reported today that the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a plenary session on the 7th to summarize the implementation of the national economic plan for the first quarter of this year.

Lin Gui-zhe, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of Korea, said in his report that the Korean working people continued to innovate and forge ahead, exceeding the first quarter industrial gross output value plan by 6%. The gross industrial output value in the first quarter of this year exceeded that of the fourth quarter of last year. The output of major industrial products such as coal, iron, steel, steel products, coke, cement, man-made fibers, cotton cloth, silk fabrics, and soybean oil significantly exceeded the planned targets for the first quarter.
Lin Gui-zhe said in his report that as a result of promoting agricultural mechanization and carrying out a nationwide movement to produce agricultural machinery, the production and supply of agricultural machinery in Korea has increased significantly. By the end of March, the production level of tractors and trucks had reached the level of 3,000 units per year.

Lin Gui-zhe said: In the rural areas of Korea, farmers are carrying out spring agricultural production with unprecedented speed and concentrating all their efforts with very high political enthusiasm.

Kim Il, First Vice-Premier of the Korean Cabinet, pointed out in his concluding remarks that efforts should be concentrated on increasing the production of minerals. Kim Il also emphasized that commercial sector personnel should improve their spirit of serving the people, strengthen close ties with production units, establish a purchasing system, and fully supply the people with high-quality commodities. Local industries should actively utilize local raw materials, improve product quality, strengthen technical forces, and improve the level of enterprise management.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th April: According to materials published today by the Vietnam Central Bureau of Statistics in local newspapers, the total output value of enterprises under the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry has exceeded the quarterly plan by 3.3% in the first quarter of this year.

According to statistics, the total output value of enterprises under the Ministry of Industry in the first quarter of this year increased by 35.8% compared with the same period last year, and also increased by 1.2% compared with the fourth quarter of last year.

According to the Vietnam News Agency, compared with the same period last year, electricity production increased by 26.1%, chemical and rubber product production increased by 113.1%, and machine tools and machinery increased by 92.6%. Labor productivity increased by 6.5%.

Since the beginning of this year, workers in various Vietnamese enterprises have launched a vigorous competition movement, determined to overcome all difficulties and change the phenomenon of "slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end." In previous years, the first quarter generally only completed 19% to 21% of the annual plan, but this year the total industrial output value in the first quarter has reached 24.8% of the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th April: Many industrial and mining enterprises in Mongolia have completed their first quarter production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets. State-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives are vigorously carrying out preparations for spring plowing and lambing.

Workers and staff throughout Mongolia are enthusiastically working to complete the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule and exceed the targets this year. Workers and staff have made remarkable achievements in the first quarter. The workers and staff of the Mongolian National Printing Factory completed 100.6% of the first quarter production plan six days ahead of schedule, and 80% of the factory's workers exceeded their planned targets. News of overfulfilling coal mining plans has been constantly reported from many production teams at the Nalaikh Coal Mine. For example, the production team of the 20th mine originally planned to mine 2,930 tons of coal in the first quarter, but as a result, it mined more than 3,100 tons of coal, exceeding the quarterly plan.

The workers and staff of local state-owned factories and enterprises in various provinces are also striving to create good results.

The workers and staff of the state-owned farms, which achieved good results in land reclamation and agricultural production last year, have decided to continue land reclamation and increase production to achieve even better results. The workers and staff are seizing the time in the first quarter to train tractor drivers, repair machinery, carry out socialist competitions, and make all preparations for spring plowing.

The central task of agricultural cooperatives throughout the country in the first quarter is lambing and protecting lambs. Inspired by the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on consolidating cooperatives, the broad masses of herdsmen are working with confidence to ensure that the number of livestock in the country reaches 24.3 million this year.
