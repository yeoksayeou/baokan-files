Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin’s report on the struggle to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) ahead of schedule, and I also fully agree with the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    The continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959 has completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Based on this great victory, the Party and the government have put forward a more ambitious plan for 1960. This plan will not only ensure a comprehensive and better leap forward this year but also create conditions for a continuous leap forward throughout the 1960s. The proposal of this plan shows that China's socialist construction has entered a new stage, and a situation of continuous leap forward with both high speed and proportional development has emerged. This is a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

    The current situation is very good. The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses is getting higher and higher, and communist ideas are being promoted more and more. A magnificent mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is developing vigorously along the correct scientific path with overwhelming momentum. From cities to villages, from small and medium-sized enterprises to modern enterprises, from state-owned enterprises to commune industries and street industries, there is a boiling scene of great technological revolution everywhere. The rural people's communes are increasingly consolidated and developed, increasingly showing their strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. The new and great development of the urban people's commune movement will further promote the development of China's production and construction and the thorough transformation of social life.

    Intellectuals' ideological remolding has made great progress on the one hand, but there are still many problems on the other hand.

    In this socialist big family full of spring, the political and ideological situation of our intellectuals has also undergone significant changes. Under the leadership and education of the Party, and under the impetus and influence of the working people, through the combination of service and remolding, our intellectuals have made great progress compared with the past. This is reflected in the fact that the desire to actively serve and strengthen remolding has become the common aspiration of the majority of people. With this desire, more and more people will definitely go all out, strive for the top, and make outstanding achievements in service and remolding. This is the mainstream of the changes in the political and ideological situation of our intellectuals today, and it is a great victory for the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals. Of course, the great progress mentioned here is in comparison with the past. Great progress does not mean that most people have solved the problem of political stance, let alone that the remolding of the worldview has just begun. Therefore, it is necessary to affirm the great progress and also affirm the need to continue to strengthen fundamental self-remolding.

    Putting forward the requirement of remolding the worldview to intellectuals will inevitably lead to a more profound transformation of their political stance.

    Every turning point in the process of social history can most centrally reflect people's political and ideological situation. Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement have emerged, pushing China's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new stage. In the face of new things, whether to approve or oppose, whether to praise or criticize, whether to firmly support or be skeptical, whether to forge ahead bravely or hesitate, different attitudes reflect different stances, viewpoints, and methods. The broad masses of working people are filled with sincere gratitude and joy for the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and for their own great initiatives. However, our intellectuals have very different attitudes towards these new things. Judging from the general situation of the members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy, although most people basically support the three magic weapons, they are far behind the high spirits and soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people. Some people lack enthusiasm, some are content with mediocrity, some accept abstractly but doubt specifically, and some even express varying degrees of dissatisfaction and resistance. The attitude towards new things, that is, the attitude towards mass movements, is the watershed between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. The fundamental reason why our intellectuals and the broad masses of working people have such different reactions to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes lies in the fact that we have different worldviews.

    The worldview is a general view of the objective world. In a class society, the worldview has class character, and different classes have different worldviews. The proletarian worldview is to stand on the position of the proletariat and treat everything in the world with a dialectical materialist viewpoint and method. The bourgeois worldview is idealistic, egoistic, and metaphysical in its treatment of everything in the world. We know that capitalism must be completely eliminated in the world, and socialism and communism must be completely victorious in the world. This is the inevitable law of social development. Now, China's socialist revolution is deepening day by day, and it has reached the era of finally and completely eliminating the remnants of capitalism and the individual economy system. All old ideas, old traditions, and old habits produced by the exploitative system and serving the exploitative system will gradually be cleared from people's minds. Precisely because of this, the objective situation has put forward the requirement of remolding the worldview to us, which means that we must transform our political stance and also transform our viewpoints and methods. The three, stance, viewpoint, and method, are basically always consistent. Today, the question of remolding the worldview is put forward to the bourgeois intellectuals because the objective situation has higher requirements for our self-remolding, and the result of this requirement will inevitably be able to more profoundly transform our political stance.

    To thoroughly destroy the bourgeois worldview and vigorously establish the proletarian worldview is certainly not an easy task and requires a long, complex, and arduous process. However, as long as we are determined to listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Party, and with the deepening and development of the socialist revolution and construction, persevere in self-revolution; then this is not mysterious and unattainable.

    In order to strengthen the transformation of stance and worldview, it is necessary to throw oneself into the mass revolutionary movement and at the same time, seriously study Chairman Mao's works.

    In order to strengthen the remolding of stance and the remolding of worldview, I think we should mainly work hard in the following two aspects:

    On the one hand, we must mount the practice horse of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, throw ourselves into the mass movement of revolution, and actively serve the socialist construction cause. The high-speed development of socialist construction urgently requires accelerating the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and accelerating the development of education, culture, and science. We should actively participate in the mass movement of technological revolution and cultural revolution and contribute all our knowledge and strength. In this way, under the leadership and education of the Party, and under the impetus and influence of the working people, we can better promote the flourishing of the proletarian and the elimination of the bourgeois, establish the determination to follow the Party wholeheartedly, cultivate the ideological feelings of loving socialism and communism, cultivate the ideological feelings of loving labor and the working people, and make the communist style of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, rushing to difficulties, and giving convenience" take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit in us. As mentioned earlier, our intellectuals have made great progress on the one hand, but there are still many problems on the other hand. Among the members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy, many people have not yet broken through the barrier of "being content with mediocrity." Some are afraid of being busy and tense, and some are tired of remolding, and there is the idea that "the advanced need to worry, the backward need to be criticized, and the middle is the most comfortable"; some people are full of doubts in their relationship with the Party, and they still cannot completely speak their true hearts to the Party. Some are afraid of this and that, think but are afraid to speak, speak but are afraid to do, do but are afraid to make mistakes, and make mistakes but are afraid to be criticized; and many people's minds are not liberated, and they are accustomed to the old ways of working, unable to jump out of the old framework, and so on. Obviously, all this is ultimately due to the bourgeois individualism of "I" being the top priority. To overcome this major obstacle, we must throw ourselves into the fiery struggle, constantly understand and master the laws of development of objective things, and transform our subjective world while transforming the objective world. Facts have proved that the "three combinations" policy put forward by the Party is completely correct. As long as we closely combine service and remolding, promote each other, and promote each other, we can get better remolding in labor practice and make more and more contributions to the cause of socialist construction.

    At the same time, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is a brilliant embodiment of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. It is creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and is the guideline for all our work. Everything will be victorious if we carry out revolution and construction in accordance with Chairman Mao's Thought, and we will move from victory to greater victory. Everything will fail if we violate Chairman Mao's Thought. This is an irrefutable truth. Now, an unprecedented mass upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works is booming across the country. This is a popularization movement of Marxism-Leninism, and it will surely promote a new and greater victory in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must throw ourselves into this movement with high political enthusiasm and full revolutionary vigor, use the fundamental method of linking theory with practice, link with historical reality, link with the current reality, especially our own ideological reality, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our stance, viewpoints, and methods; at the same time, actively strive to participate in labor training, learn the noble qualities of the working people, cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people, thoroughly destroy the bourgeois worldview, and vigorously establish the proletarian worldview.

    Under the wise and correct leadership of our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao, the tomorrow of our motherland will surely be brighter and more splendid. We must actively respond to the Party's call, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, establish lofty aspirations, and strive to serve more actively, continue to strengthen remolding, and bravely advance towards the goals of socialism and communism!

### 知识分子要大立无产阶级世界观  王绍鏊委员的发言

专栏：

    知识分子要大立无产阶级世界观
    王绍鏊委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（草案）而斗争的报告，并且完全同意中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告、中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。在这个伟大胜利基础上，党和政府又提出了更加宏伟的1960年的计划。这个计划不仅将使今年这一年获得全面的更好的跃进，而且将为整个六十年代的不断跃进创造条件。这个计划的提出说明我国的社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的阶段，出现了既高速度又按比例发展的持续跃进的局面。这是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    目前的形势好得很。广大群众的劳动热情愈来愈高涨，共产主义思想愈来愈发扬。一个波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命的全民运动，正在以排山倒海之势沿着正确的科学的道路猛烈发展，从城市到农村，从中小型企业到现代化企业，从国营企业到公社工业和街道工业，到处是技术大革命的沸腾景象。农村人民公社日益巩固和发展，越来越显示出它的强大的生命力和无比的优越性，城市人民公社运动的新的巨大发展，将进一步促进我国生产建设的发展和社会生活的彻底改造。
    知识分子的思想改造，一方面大有进步，另一方面问题不少
    在这个满园春色的社会主义大家庭里，我们知识分子的政治思想状况也发生了显著的变化。在党的领导和教育下，在劳动人民的带动和影响下，通过服务与改造相结合的途径，我们知识分子和以往比起来，是大有进步了。这表现在要求积极服务、加强改造，已经成为多数人的共同愿望。有了这个愿望，一定会有愈来愈多的人鼓足干劲、力争上游，在服务和改造中作出出色的成绩来。这是今天我们知识分子政治思想状况变化的主流，是党的团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策的伟大胜利。当然，这里所说的大有进步，是和以往的情况比较而言，一方面大有进步，另一方面存在问题还不少。大有进步并不等于大多数人已经解决了政治立场问题，更何况世界观的改造还刚刚开始。因此，既要肯定大有进步，又要肯定必须继续不断地加强自我根本改造。
    对知识分子提出改造世界观的要求，结果必然能更加深刻地改造他们的政治立场
    社会历史进程中的每一个转折点，最能够集中地反映出人们的政治思想状况。1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了大跃进和人民公社化运动，把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推进到了一个新的阶段。在新生事物面前，是赞成还是反对，是歌颂还是挑剔，是坚决拥护还是将信将疑，是勇往直前还是徘徊犹豫，在不同的态度中反映出不同的立场、观点和方法。广大劳动人民对于党和毛主席的英明正确领导，对于自己的伟大创举，充满了由衷的感激和喜悦。而我们知识分子，对待这些新生事物的态度就大不相同。从我们中国民主促进会成员的一般情况来看，虽然大多数人对于三大法宝基本上是拥护的，但是和广大劳动人民那样意气风发、干劲冲天比较起来，那就差得太远了。有的人缺乏热情，有的人甘居中游，有的人抽象的接受，具体的怀疑，有的人甚至表现过不同程度的不满和抵触。对待新生事物的态度，也就是对待群众运动的态度，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的分水岭。我们知识分子和广大劳动人民，对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社会有这样不同的反应，根本原因就在于我们存在着不同的世界观。
    世界观就是对于客观世界的一个总的看法。在阶级社会里，世界观是有阶级性的，不同的阶级有不同的世界观。无产阶级的世界观，就是站在无产阶级的立场上，用唯物辩证的观点和方法来对待世界上的一切事物。资产阶级的世界观是唯心的、唯我的，是形而上学地对待世界上的一切事物。我们知道，资本主义一定要在全世界彻底灭亡，社会主义和共产主义一定要在全世界彻底胜利，这是社会发展的必然规律。现在，我国的社会主义革命日益深入，已经到了最后彻底消灭资本主义和个体经济制度残余的时代，一切由剥削制度所产生、为剥削制度服务的旧思想、旧传统、旧习惯，都将逐步地从人们的头脑里清除干净。正是由于这样，客观形势对我们提出了改造世界观的要求，这也就是说，我们要改造政治立场，也要改造观点和方法。立场、观点和方法这三者基本上总是一致的。今天对资产阶级知识分子提出改造世界观的问题，是因为客观形势对于我们的自我改造有了更高的要求，而这样要求的结果，必然能够更加深刻地改造我们的政治立场。
    大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，当然不是一件容易的事，需要经过一个长期的、复杂的、艰巨的过程。但是，只要我们下定决心，听毛主席的话，跟着党走，随着社会主义革命和建设的日益深入和发展，坚持不懈地进行自我革命；那么，这也并不是神秘的，高不可攀的。
    为了加强立场和世界观的改造，必须投入群众革命运动，同时认真地学习毛主席的著作
    为了加强改造立场，加强改造世界观，我认为主要应当从以下两个方面去努力：
    一方面要跨上技术革命和文化革命的实践之马，投入革命的群众运动，为社会主义建设事业积极服务。社会主义建设的高速度发展，迫切要求加速技术革命和文化革命，加速发展教育、文化、科学事业。我们应当积极投入到技术革命和文化革命的群众运动中去，贡献自己的全部知识和力量。这样，我们在党的领导和教育下，在劳动人民的带动和影响下，就可以更好地兴无灭资，树立一心一意跟党走的决心，培养热爱社会主义、共产主义的思想感情，培养热爱劳动和劳动人民的思想感情，使“学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进、抢困难、让方便”的共产主义风格在我们身上生根发芽，开花结果。正如前面所提到，我们知识分子一方面是大有进步，另一方面存在问题还不少。在我们中国民主促进会的成员中，许多人至今还没有攻破“甘居中游”这个关，有的怕忙，怕紧张，有的厌倦改造，存在着“先进要费心，落后要批评，中游最舒服”的想法；一部分人在和党的关系上，疑虑重重，对党还不能彻底谈真心话，有的怕这怕那，想了怕说，说了怕做，做了怕错，错了怕批评；还有不少人思想不解放，工作上习惯于老一套，跳不出旧框框，等等。显然，这一切归根结底是资产阶级个人主义“我字当头”在那里作祟。要克服这个重大障碍，必须投入火热的斗争中去，不断地认识和掌握客观事物的发展规律，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。事实证明，党提出的“三以”方针是完全正确的，只要把服务与改造密切结合起来，相互推动，相互促进，我们就能够在劳动实践中得到更好的改造，并为社会主义建设事业作出越来越多的贡献。
    同时必须认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。毛泽东思想就是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的光辉的体现，是创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义，是我们进行一切工作的准则。凡是按照毛主席的思想进行革命和建设，就一定会取得胜利，从胜利走向更大的胜利；凡是违背了毛主席的思想的，就一定要失败。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。现在，一个空前规模的群众性的学习毛主席著作的高潮，正在全国范围内蓬勃开展。这是一个马克思列宁主义的普及运动，它必将促进我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的更伟大的胜利。我们必须以高度的政治热情、充分的革命干劲，投入到这个运动中去，运用理论联系实际的根本方法，联系历史实际，联系当前实际，特别是自己的思想实际，用毛泽东思想改造自己的立场、观点和方法；同时，积极争取参加劳动锻炼，学习劳动人民的高贵品质，培养劳动人民的思想感情，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观。
    在我们伟大的党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明正确领导下，我们祖国的明天必将更加光明灿烂。我们一定要积极响应党的号召，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，树雄心、立大志，进一步积极服务，继续加强改造，向着社会主义、共产主义的目标奋勇前进！
