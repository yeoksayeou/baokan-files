Xinhua News Agency, March 31st – The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held its 32nd administrative meeting on the evening of March 28th to discuss health work. It warmly welcomed the proposal from the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee to conduct a friendly competition in the patriotic health campaign among Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. It decided to accept Shanghai's challenge under the same conditions (with the exception of individual competition targets due to differing regional situations, such as schistosomiasis and filariasis, which Beijing does not have). The meeting decided to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously promote, create momentum, and engage in sanitation on a large scale, eliminate the four pests on a grand scale, and vigorously carry out mass sports activities to enhance the people's physique and improve the people's health level, so as to comprehensively push Beijing's patriotic health campaign to a new climax.
