People's Communes and Communist Style
Representative Lin Yixin Talks About the Great Achievements of People's Communes in Rural Fujian

Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the draft 1960 state budget, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Listening to the reports has greatly inspired us. They vividly summarize the great achievements our people have made in the continued Great Leap Forward over the past year, and theoretically summarize our successful experience in building socialism at high speed and proportionately. Our great achievements and successful experiences shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. Guided by Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, the reports also put forward a magnificent plan for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 to the 600 million people of our country. This year is the first year of the 1960s, and the realization of this year's plan for the development of the national economy is of great significance for the sustained leap forward of the national economy throughout the entire decade. The people of Fujian, together with the people of the whole country, must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and work harder to resolutely struggle to complete this glorious and great task this year. We firmly believe that as long as we study Chairman Mao's works more carefully, hold high the victorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and adhere to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will certainly be able to achieve a continued leap forward in the national economy in 1960 with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Now I would like to express some opinions on the issue of people's communes in rural Fujian.

    Fujian's Agricultural Production Last Year Was an Extraordinary Leap Forward

    Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, while continuously achieving the Great Leap Forward in the development of the national economy in 1958 and 1959, the people's commune movement in rural Fujian has also moved forward along a path of consolidation and sound development. In the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's communes have become increasingly prominent. It is not only changing the economic face of Fujian, but also changing the spiritual face of the 15 million people of Fujian. It has created extremely favorable conditions for our province to continue to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and to carry out socialist construction at high speed in all aspects.
    Our province's people's communes, due to the correct implementation of the Central Committee's principles regarding the three-level management of people's communes, with the production team as the basic accounting unit, exchange at equal value, and distribution according to labor, and due to the correct implementation of the policy that people's communes must simultaneously carry out industry and agriculture, agriculture and forestry (fishery), crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and self-sufficient production and commodity production, the superiority of their large scale and high degree of public ownership, integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery has become increasingly apparent. Last year, although Fujian, especially the coastal areas, suffered three consecutive unusually severe typhoon and flood disasters that had not been seen for decades, agricultural production still achieved an all-round bumper harvest. Grain increased by 21.6% compared to 1958 (unit yield increased by 37.74%); the output value of forestry increased by 60% compared to 1958, with a total afforestation area of more than 9.79 million mu, an increase of 47.46% compared to 1958, and 3.7 million cubic meters of timber harvested, an increase of 132% compared to 1958; the output value of animal husbandry increased by 45%. By the end of last year, the province had raised more than 4.48 million pigs. Especially after the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions on "raising pigs in a big way" and "attaching equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry" in October, the number of live pigs increased by more than 1.4 million in less than three months. The output value of fishery increased by 44%; the output value of sideline occupations increased by 37%. Commune-run industries have developed greatly. In 1959, the total output value of commune-run industries reached 205 million yuan. All communes in the province have established agricultural implement manufacturing plants, and all production teams have established agricultural implement repair stations. They have also actively established a large number of small-scale hydroelectric power stations (according to statistics from the first half of March, 649 small-scale hydroelectric power stations have been built in rural areas throughout the province, with an installed capacity of more than 13,000 kilowatts; there are a total of more than 13,600 hydraulic power stations, with a power of more than 84,000 horsepower), fertilizer plants, small-scale coal and iron mines, iron smelting plants, agricultural and sideline product processing plants, small-scale forest chemical plants mainly producing fiberboard and tannin extract, and brick and tile factories and cement plants, greatly promoting the technical transformation of agriculture and the development of production. Due to the rapid development of people's communes, the commodity output value last year increased by 17% compared to 1958. In the past three months, while achieving a "red start" on the industrial front, a situation of continued leap forward has also emerged in the vast countryside. All parts of the province are implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture at a higher standard, and the spring plowing work centered on water, fertilizer, and soil is being done better than in any previous year. Under the slogan of "fighting drought to ensure spring harvest and fighting drought to ensure spring planting," the broad masses of commune members have overcome a severe drought of more than 160 days and won a bumper harvest of more than 5.23 million mu of wheat and barley, breaking the established theory that "wheat and barley cannot achieve high yields." High-yield records of 500 jin, 800 jin, and even 1,000 jin per mu, as well as large areas of high-yield and high-production fields, have emerged everywhere. In the Hanjian Commune of Putian County, the average yield per mu of more than 5,100 mu of early-maturing wheat that has already been harvested from more than 30,000 mu of spring wheat reached 422 jin, an increase of 80% compared to last year. At the same time, spring planting is being carried out without violating the farming season. Large-scale land reclamation and enclosure have also been carried out before the busy spring plowing season. This has laid a solid foundation for the continued leap forward of agriculture in our province this year. This excellent situation shows that the transformation of production relations has greatly liberated the social productive forces, enabling the entire national economy to leap forward at high speed and proportionately. The great leap forward in agriculture has strongly promoted the development of light industry and heavy industry (in 1959, light industry increased by 41% compared to 1958, and heavy industry increased by 76%); at the same time, the huge increase in industrial production has in turn promoted the rapid development of agriculture; and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture has further promoted the prosperity of science, culture, and education.

    Large-Scale Operations to Develop "Wanbaoshan"

    With the people's commune, such a best form of organization, we can concentrate our forces and organize large-scale operations like fighting a war in further conquering nature and developing various production and construction undertakings on a large scale. Practice has proven that this is a socialist mode of large-scale production and an effective way to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; this could not be done in the past with small-scale agricultural production cooperatives. Last year, Taiping Commune in Zhao'an County in our province, responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for gardenization of the land, implemented the simultaneous development of agriculture and forestry and the large-scale development of forestry production. Using the method of large-scale, vigorous, and swift assault operations, they seized the opportunity during the slack farming season and successively organized three major battles to develop "Wanbaoshan," reclaiming wasteland, afforesting, and planting fruit trees on 63,800 mu in one fell swoop, developing 90% of the barren mountains in the entire commune. This speed is ten times faster than the period of advanced cooperatives, forty times faster than the period of elementary cooperatives, and fully one hundred times faster than the period of mutual aid teams. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee summarized the successful experience of Taiping Commune, believing that this is a manifestation of the unparalleled power of the people's commune and pointing out a direction for all the people's communes in the province to develop the mountainous economy and develop other socialist undertakings at high speed. The Provincial Party Committee called on the people of the entire province to earnestly learn from the noble style of Taiping Commune, vigorously promote their experience, and launch a high tide of "learning from Taiping, comparing with Taiping, and catching up with Taiping" to develop "Wanbaoshan." People's communes in various places, according to the local natural conditions and technical experience, have formulated unified plans for developing barren mountains, implementing comprehensive operations of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and adopting the policy of "using the short-term to support the long-term" (intercropping food crops in forest land and orchards, etc.), so that the benefits of many years later are closely linked with the benefits of the current year, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for developing the mountainous economy. In just two short months, the entire province mobilized more than 3 million people to go to the mountains, reclaiming wasteland and building terraced fields on more than 4 million mu, and afforesting an area of more than 17 million mu. Guanqiao Commune in Anxi County also created a good method of short-spike cutting and rapid seedling cultivation, solving the difficulty of insufficient seedlings caused by the high-speed and large-scale land reclamation, so that the newly developed mountain land could be planted in a timely manner with fruit trees and a variety of subtropical crops and food crops. This huge achievement also fully embodies the urgent desire of hundreds of millions of working people to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness," and reflects their lofty ideals and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm for building a beautiful new life of socialism and communism. When the Taiping Commune Party Committee proposed the "four ten-thousands" plan of developing ten thousand mu of fruit trees, ten thousand mu of bamboo, ten thousand mu of forests, and ten thousand mu of oil tea, the broad masses of commune members universally reflected that "the Party Committee has truly grasped our hearts." Immediately, a magnificent scene of "thousands of troops and horses fighting barren mountains, and the earth changing into new clothes day and night" appeared throughout the commune. Commune members of Yuxi Commune in Fuqing County described the future prospect of developing "Wanbaoshan" as "flowers and fruits blooming in all seasons, the forest waves like the sea, all six animals flourishing, and benefiting hundreds of millions of generations." While vigorously reclaiming wasteland, the coastal areas also launched a wave of advancing towards the sea and competing with the sea for land in the form of large-scale operations, carrying out coastal enclosure and reclaiming more than 240,000 mu of new cultivated land, enabling the people's communes in the coastal areas with little land to rapidly expand the scale of production. Due to the huge achievements obtained from high-speed land reclamation and enclosure, agricultural production in our province will be able to better implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward"; while expanding the area of grain cultivation, we will vigorously develop diversified economies, provide more products for the needs of people's lives, and provide abundant raw materials for the further development of light industry; and we will rapidly expand the collective economy of the communes and increase the income of commune members, creating conditions for a gradual transition to a higher level of collective economy.

    The Noble Communist Style Is Universally Promoted

    After the realization of people's communes in our province, with the major changes in production relations, the mental outlook and social life of the people have also undergone extremely profound changes. Associated with the socialist mode of large-scale production of large-scale operations, the widespread development of communist large-scale cooperation, and the noble communist spirit of putting others before oneself and selflessness have been universally promoted. Last year, when the coastal areas of our province were hit by unusually severe typhoons and rainstorms that had not been seen for decades (when a typhoon of level 12 or above landed in Xiamen, the seawalls and buildings built with granite, as well as the wharves with reinforced concrete structures, were blown down, large trees were uprooted, and houses collapsed in pieces. For a time, urban transportation, telephone, and power lines were all cut off.), a moving scene of one household helping another that was affected by the disaster, one production team helping another that was affected by the disaster, and one commune helping another that was affected by the disaster emerged everywhere. For example, in Yuzhen Brigade of Lianhua Commune in Haicheng County, located on Yuzhenzhou at the mouth of the Jiulong River, most of the fifteen-kilometer levee was destroyed. Even if all the labor force of the entire brigade were mobilized, it would take sixty days to repair it; and if the levee were not repaired as soon as possible, the upcoming August high tide would flood the entire Yuzhenzhou. At this critical juncture, the commune immediately transferred more than 8,700 laborers from eighteen brigades that were not affected by the disaster or were less affected, bringing their own grain, vegetables, and tools to the disaster area, and blocked all the breaches in the levee on the same day, protecting the late rice fields. After the disaster, after processing and fertilizing, this brigade finally created the miracle of achieving an extraordinary bumper harvest in the face of an extraordinary disaster. The average yield per mu of late rice in the entire brigade exceeded 1,000 jin. In this spring's large-scale drought resistance struggle, even more unimaginable deeds have emerged. For example, Jinjiang Prefecture universally broke through the boundaries of production teams, communes, and counties, giving full play to the powerful power of the people's communes to resist the severe drought. Jinjiang, Nan'an, Anxi, and Quanzhou and other four cities and counties alone transferred more than 150,000 people from the communes to form a drought resistance army, sealing streams and blocking rivers, building dams layer by layer, and opening irrigation canals everywhere, diverting the rolling river water flowing into the sea to both banks, immediately increasing the irrigation area by more than 300,000 mu. In the drought resistance, people's communes in various places universally implemented unified leadership, unified planning for water use and water conservation according to the irrigation system, and unified allocation of manpower and material resources, and finally overcame the severe drought of more than 160 days, achieving "not losing a single mu of spring planting and not losing a single grain of spring harvest."
    The broad masses of cadres and people in our province have also demonstrated lofty aspirations, daring to think and daring to do, and a noble communist style of not fearing difficulties in all aspects. For example, when formulating plans, they mention several tens of thousands or dozens of hundreds of thousands at a time, just as the commune members of Taiping Commune said: "The commune has great power to reclaim wasteland, so we must start with the character 'ten thousand'." And they do what they say and complete their plans with battle-like actions. People dare to break with convention, boldly carry out experiments, and actively adopt advanced technologies to enable many low-yielding areas to create large areas of high-yield and high-production records. Historically, the low-yielding mountainous areas have universally seen large areas of 1,000-jin rice and 10,000-jin sweet potatoes. The commune members in the mountainous areas say well: "In the past, it was rare to see 1,000 jin, but now 1,000 jin is not uncommon!" In Fushan Brigade of Jiaocheng Commune in Ningde County, 400 mu out of more than 900 mu of land were originally low-yielding fields, and every year they had to rely on state loans and grain allocations. After communization, they concentrated their efforts to add soil and fertilizer, build water conservancy, and transform the low-yielding fields. Last year, the average yield per mu jumped to 866 jin, and the average income per commune member reached 109 yuan, throwing off the hat of poor brigade in one fell swoop and catching up with the rich brigade. In early February of this year, the Fuan area, in conjunction with the preparatory work for spring plowing, launched a large-scale movement to transform low-yielding fields, and in just over twenty days, it transformed 530,000 mu of various types of low-yielding fields, such as rotten mud fields, cold water fields, and lean barren fields. After comprehensive management and comprehensive transformation, these low-yielding fields have taken on a new look, with rotten mud no longer rotting, cold water no longer cold, lean fields becoming fertile fields, and dry fields becoming paddy fields. Vigorously transforming low-yielding fields has become an important measure for poor mountainous brigades to catch up with rich brigades, and it is also a way to increase grain production with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. People's daring-to-think and daring-to-do communist style is also manifested in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. After communization, various places have reformed and created a large number of diverse tools, increasing the efficiency of plowing, harvesting, water conservancy construction, agricultural and sideline product processing, and transportation by several times or dozens of times. Recently, the tool reform movement has been extended to canteens, cooking, and animal husbandry, etc. For example, the canteen of Shangyang Brigade of Chengmen Commune in Minhou County has realized the semi-mechanization of the entire set of cooking utensils, reducing the number of cooks serving 3,700 people from 84 to 18, and the food has become better and better. This has better organized collective life, further consolidating the socialist position of public canteens in rural areas and further promoting the development of production. Due to the universal establishment of rural people's collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens, housework has become increasingly socialized, enabling millions of women to walk out of the kitchens of their homes, get rid of the cumbersome household chores, and throw themselves into production and construction with a happy mood. The famous Huinu Reservoir (with a storage capacity of 100 million cubic meters, which can irrigate 240,000 mu of farmland) in the province was built mainly by more than 13,000 Huian women.
    The communist ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members in our province is increasing day by day. Under the slogan of "hard work for one generation, happiness for ten thousand generations," selfless labor that "seizes difficulties and gives way to convenience" and makes no conditions is emerging everywhere. In large-scale operations and in the struggle against natural disasters, they are also so organized and disciplined, and they are indeed an invincible agricultural production army. Their communist style is constantly being carried forward and developed under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. The continuous improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members, the rapid development of the commune economy, the continuous growth of communist sprouts, the gradual narrowing of the gap between poor and rich brigades, the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization in the production process, the continuous popularization of cultural education, and the better and better social welfare undertakings, etc., make us see the bright and brilliant prospects of the people's communes more and more clearly.

    Fellow representatives, our province is located on the frontline of coastal defense and undertakes the glorious task of defending the socialist construction of the motherland. The troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in our province, while performing arduous coastal defense tasks, also actively participated in the industrial and agricultural production and construction of our province. They have given strong support in terms of manpower and material resources in the large-scale development of industry, the large-scale construction of water conservancy, the resistance to natural disasters, and the busy season of production. Wherever there are difficulties, they go there; their lofty communist style and fighting spirit of overcoming all difficulties, selfless labor, and selflessness have a profound educational and great encouragement effect on the people of our province. They are both defenders of socialist undertakings and builders of socialist undertakings. And the people's communes in our province, due to the implementation of the integration of labor and military affairs and the involvement of all people in the military, have also shown great power in supporting the People's Liberation Army in combating military provocations and harassment and sabotage by US-Chiang and defending socialist construction over the past year or so. In the future, we must continue to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes as a five-in-one entity of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, continue to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's great military thinking of the people's army, strengthen the work of militia building, and better mobilize the people of the entire province to oppose any war provocations and war conspiracies of US imperialism, and to strive for the defense of world peace, the consolidation of national defense, and the defense of socialist construction!

    人民公社和共产主义风格
    林一心代表谈福建农村人民公社的伟大成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和人大常务委员会的工作报告。听了报告使我们受到极大的鼓舞。它们生动地概括了我国人民在过去一年继续大跃进中所取得的伟大成就，从理论上高度地总结了我们高速度按比例地建设社会主义的成功经验。我们伟大的成就和成功的经验，闪耀着马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的光辉。报告中又以毛主席的不断革命思想为指导，向我国六亿人民提出了1960年继续跃进的宏伟壮丽的计划。今年是二十世纪六十年代的第一年，实现今年发展国民经济的计划，对于整个六十年代国民经济的持续跃进有着巨大的意义。我们福建人民要和全国人民一道，一定要更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，再接再厉地为完成今年这个光荣而伟大的任务而坚决奋斗。我们坚信，只要我们更加认真学习毛主席的著作，高举毛泽东思想的胜利旗帜，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社，我们就一定能够多快好省实现1960年国民经济的继续跃进。
    现在我就福建农村人民公社问题发表一点意见。
    福建去年农业生产是特大跃进
    福建人民在党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在连续实现1958年和1959年的发展国民经济的大跃进的同时，福建农村人民公社化运动也沿着巩固的、健全发展的道路向前迈进。在社会主义建设事业的大跃进中，人民公社强大的生命力和无比的优越性已日益显著地发挥出来。它不但改变着福建的经济面貌，而且也在改变着福建一千五百万人民的精神面貌。它为我省继续贯彻以农业为国民经济基础的方针，高速度地进行社会主义建设，从各方面创造了极为有利的条件。
    我省人民公社由于正确地贯彻了中央关于人民公社三级管理、队为基础、等价交换、按劳分配等原则，由于正确贯彻了关于人民公社必须执行工业和农业同时并举，农业和林业（渔业）同时并举，种植业和畜牧业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，因而它的一大二公、工农商学兵一体、农林牧副渔综合发展的优越性，越来越充分地显示出来。去年福建各地，特别是沿海地区，虽然连续三次遭受数十年来罕有的特大风、洪灾害的袭击，农业生产仍然取得了全面大丰收，粮食比1958年增长21.6％（单位产量增长37.74％）；林业产值比1958年增长60％，全年造林面积九百七十九万多亩，比1958年增长47.46％，木材到材三百七十万立方米，比1958年增长132％；畜牧业产值增长45％，到去年底为止，全省养猪四百四十八万多头，特别是在10月间贯彻了毛主席关于“大养其猪”、“种植业与饲养业并重”的指示以后，不到三个月的时间，生猪头数增加了一百四十多万头。渔业产值增长44％；副业产值增长37％。社办工业有了很大的发展，1959年社办工业总产值达二亿零五百万元。全省的公社，社社办有农具制造厂、队队办有农具修配站，还根据自己的条件，积极地兴办了大量的小型水力、水电站（到3月上半月的统计，全省农村已办起六百四十九个小型水电站，装机容量一万三千多瓩；水力站共有一万三千六百多处，动力达八万四千多马力）、肥料厂、小型煤、铁矿、炼铁厂、农副产品加工厂、以生产纤维板和栲胶为主的小型林产化工厂和砖瓦厂、水泥厂等社办工厂企业，大大地促进了农业的技术改造和生产的发展。由于人民公社的迅速发展，去年商品产值比1958年增长了17％。今年三个月来，在工业战线实现“开门红”的同时，广大农村也出现了继续大跃进的局面。全省各地都以更高的标准贯彻农业“八字宪法”，以水、肥、土为中心的春耕工作做得比过去任何一年都要好；广大社员在“抗旱保春收、抗旱保春种”的口号下，战胜了一百六十多天的大旱，夺得了五百二十三万多亩大小麦的大丰收，打破了“大小麦不能高产”的定论，到处出现了亩产五百斤、八百斤以至一千斤的高产纪录，和大面积的高额丰产片。莆田县涵江公社的三万多亩春麦中，已收割的五千一百多亩早熟小麦平均亩产四百二十二斤，比去年增产了八成。并且不违农时地进行春种；同时还在春耕大忙到来之前，进行了大规模的开荒、围垦。这就为我省今年农业的继续大跃进奠定了牢靠的基础。这样的大好形势，说明了生产关系的变革，大大解放了社会生产力，使整个国民经济得以高速度按比例地向前飞跃。农业大跃进，有力地促进了轻工业和重工业的发展（1959年轻工业比1958年增长41％，重工业增长76％）；同时工业生产的巨大增长，反过来又推动了农业的迅速发展；而工农业的大跃进，又促使科学文教事业进一步繁荣起来。
    大兵团作战开发“万宝山”
    有了人民公社这样一种最好的组织形式，因此在进一步征服自然，大规模地发展各项生产建设事业中，能够像打仗一样，集中兵力，组织大兵团作战。实践证明，这是一种社会主义的大生产方式，是多快好省建设社会主义的一种有效办法；在过去小规模的农业生产合作社，是不能办到的。去年我省诏安县太平公社响应党中央和毛主席关于大地园林化的伟大号召，在贯彻农、林业并举，大规模发展林业生产中，运用大刀阔斧、雷厉风行的大兵团突击作战的方法，抓住农闲时机，先后组织了三次开发“万宝山”的大战役，一举开荒造林种果六万三千八百亩，把全社90％的荒山都开发起来。这种速度比高级社时期快十倍，比初级社时期快四十倍，比互助组时期快了足足一百倍。中共福建省委总结了太平公社的成功经验，认为这是人民公社无比威力的体现，是给全省人民公社指出了一个高速度开发山区经济和发展其他社会主义事业的方向。省委号召全省人民认真学习太平公社的崇高风格，大力推广他们的经验，掀起“学太平、比太平、赶太平”的开发“万宝山”的热潮。各地人民公社根据当地的自然条件和技术经验，制订了开发荒山的统一规划，实行农、林、牧等综合经营，并采取“以短养长”的方针（林地、果园套种杂粮等），使多年以后的收益与当年的收益紧密结合起来，因而充分调动了广大群众开发山区经济的积极性。全省在短短两个月的时间内，就发动了三百多万人上山，开荒修梯田四百多万亩，造林面积达一千七百多万亩。安溪县官桥公社又创造了短穗扦插、快速育苗的好办法，解决了由于高速度的大量开荒而带来的种苗不足的困难，使新开发的山地得以及时种上果木和多种多样的亚热带作物、杂粮等。这一巨大成就也充分体现了千百万劳动人民要求迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的迫切愿望，反映了他们建设社会主义、共产主义美好新生活的远大理想和冲天的革命干劲。当太平公社党委提出开发万亩果、万亩竹、万亩林、万亩油茶的“四个万”规划时，广大社员普遍反映“党委真正抓到了我们的心”。随即全社出现了“千军万马战荒山、大地昼夜换新装”的壮丽图景。福清县渔溪公社社员描绘开发“万宝山”后即将实现的前景是“花果四季开，林涛似大海，六畜皆兴旺，造福亿万代”。在大事开荒的同时，沿海地区也以大兵团作战的方式，掀起了向海进军，与海争地的浪潮，进行海滩围垦，夺得了二十四万多亩新的耕地，使少地的沿海人民公社迅速扩大了生产规模。由于高速度开荒围垦所获得的巨大成就，我省农业生产将能更好地贯彻“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针；在扩大粮食种植面积的同时，大力发展多种经济，为人民生活需要提供更多的产品，为轻工业的进一步发展提供丰富的原料；并将迅速扩大社有经济和增加社员收入，为逐步向更高的集体经济过渡创造条件。
    崇高的共产主义风格普遍发扬
    我省实现人民公社化以后，随着生产关系的重大变革，人们的精神面貌和社会生活也发生了极其深刻的变化。和大兵团作战这一社会主义的大生产方式相联系的，是共产主义大协作的广泛开展，先人后己、舍己为人的崇高的共产主义精神普遍得到了发扬。去年我省沿海遭到几十年来罕有的特大台风和暴雨袭击时（十二级以上的台风在厦门登陆时，用花岗岩修建的海堤和建筑物，以及钢筋水泥结构的码头被刮毁，大树连根拔，房屋成片倒塌，一时市内交通、电话、电力线路全部断绝。），到处出现了一家受灾万家支援，一队受灾全社支援，一社受灾全县支援的动人局面。例如在九龙江入海处的玉枕洲上的海澄县莲花公社玉枕大队，十五公里围堤大部被冲毁，即使全队劳力全部出动，也要六十天的时间才能修复；而围堤如不及早修好，即将到来的8月大潮会把整个玉枕洲淹没。在这紧急关头，公社立即从十八个未受灾和受灾较轻的大队，抽调八千七百多个劳力，自带粮菜、工具，赶到灾区，当天就把围堤决口全部堵住，保住了晚稻田。灾后又经过加工加肥，这个大队终于创造了遇到特大灾害获得特大丰收的奇迹，全队晚稻平均亩产超过了千斤。在今春大规模的抗旱斗争中，更是出现了许多想像不到的事迹。如晋江地区普遍打破队界、社界、县界，充分发挥人民公社的强大威力，抗击严重的旱灾，仅晋江、南安、安溪、泉州等四县市就由公社抽调了十五万多人，组成抗旱大军，封溪堵河，层层修建拦河坝，处处开辟引水渠，把滚滚东流入海的江水引上两岸，一下增加了灌溉面积三十多万亩。在抗旱中，各地人民公社普遍地实行统一领导，按灌溉系统统一规划用水和节约用水，统一调配人力、物力，终于战胜了一百六十多天的大旱，做到了“春种一亩不少，春收一颗不丢。”
    我省广大群众和干部还从各方面表现出雄心壮志，敢想敢做和不畏困难的共产主义的崇高风格。如制订规划时，一提就是几个万、几十个万，正如太平公社社员所说：“公社开荒力量大，就要万字来当头”，并且说干就干，以战斗般的行动完成了自己的计划。人们勇于打破常规，大胆进行试验，积极采用先进技术使许多低产地区创造了大面积的高额丰产纪录。历史上素来低产的山区，普遍出现了成片的千斤稻、万斤薯。山区社员说得好：“往年千斤难得见，如今千斤不稀罕！”宁德县焦城公社福山大队，九百多亩土地中有四百多亩原是低产田，年年都得依靠国家贷款、拨粮。公社化后他们集中力量添土加肥、兴修水利，改造了低产田，去年平均亩产跃到八百六十六斤，社员每人平均收入达到一百零九元，一举抛掉了穷队帽子，赶上了富队。福安地区结合备耕工作在今年2月初开展了声势浩大的改造低产田运动，只二十多天时间就改造了烂泥田、冷水田、瘦瘠田等各类低产田五十三万多亩。这些低产田经过综合治理，全面改造后，面貌焕然一新，烂泥不烂、冷水不冷、瘦田变肥田、旱田变水田，单季稻田可以改种双季稻。大力改造低产田已成为山区穷队赶富队的一条重要措施，也是多快好省地增产粮食的道路。人们的敢想敢做的共产主义风格还表现在开展技术革新和技术革命方面，公社化以后，各地改革和创造了大量的多种多样的工具，使耕作收刈、兴修水利、农副产品加工、交通运输等几倍几十倍地提高了工效。最近工具改革运动已推向食堂炊事、畜牧饲养等方面。如闽侯县城门公社上洋大队食堂，实现了整套的炊具半机械化，管三千七百人吃饭的炊事员从八十四人减少到十八人，而且饭菜越办越好。这就更好地组织了集体生活，使公共食堂这一农村的社会主义阵地更加巩固，进一步促进了生产的发展。由于普遍兴办了以公共食堂为中心的农村人民集体福利事业，家务劳动日益社会化，使几百万妇女走出了家庭锅灶间，摆脱了繁琐的家务牵累，心情舒畅地投入了生产建设。闻名全省的惠女大水库（蓄水量一亿公方，可灌溉农田二十四万亩）就是以一万三千多名惠安妇女为主兴建起来的。
    我省广大社员的共产主义思想觉悟日益提高，在“一代辛苦，万代幸福”的口号下，到处出现着“抢困难、让方便”、不讲条件的忘我劳动。在大兵团作战中，在抗击自然灾害的斗争中，还表现得那么有组织有纪律，确是一支战无不胜攻无不克的农业产业大军。他们的这种共产主义风格，是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下不断地发扬光大的。人民公社广大社员思想觉悟的不断提高，公社经济的迅速发展和共产主义萌芽的不断成长，穷队与富队的差别逐步缩小，生产过程机械化程度的不断提高，文化教育的不断普及，社会福利事业的越办越好等等，使我们越来越清楚地看到了人民公社光辉灿烂的前景。
    各位代表，我省地处海防前线，在保卫祖国的社会主义建设中担负着光荣的任务。中国人民解放军驻我省部队，在执行繁重的海防任务的同时，还积极参加了我省的工农业生产建设。在大办工业、大兴水利、抗击自然灾害和生产大忙中，都给予了人力、物力上的有力支持。那里有困难他们就到那里去；他们那种排除万难、忘我劳动、舍己为人的崇高的共产主义风格和战斗精神，对我省人民具有深刻的教育和莫大的鼓舞作用。他们既是社会主义事业的保卫者，又是社会主义事业的建设者。而我省人民公社由于实行劳武结合、全民皆兵，一年多来在支援人民解放军打击美蒋军事挑衅和骚扰破坏，保卫社会主义建设方面，也显示了巨大的威力。今后我们要继续充分发挥人民公社工农商学兵五位一体的优越性，继续认真贯彻毛主席伟大的人民军队军事思想，加强民兵建设工作，更好地动员全省人民为反对美帝国主义的任何战争挑衅和战争阴谋，为保卫世界和平，巩固国防、保卫社会主义建设而奋斗！
