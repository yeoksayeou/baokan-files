　　Bravely Fighting Rapids to Build a Rainbow
　　By our reporter Liu Jiansheng

　　The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is completed. The builders are waving goodbye to this magnificent bridge. Some will go to Jinan, some to Nanjing, and some to Wuhu, where new bridge projects await them.

　　From the Yangtze River to the Yellow River, and from the Yellow River back to the Yangtze, battling rivers and benefiting the people with their hard work, wisdom, and courage has become commonplace for this bridge-building team. Here, they experienced and overcame numerous difficulties and fought bravely against floods, severe cold, and windstorms. In less than two years, they completed the construction of this permanent double-track railway bridge, finishing the task six months ahead of the national plan, adding a glorious page to the history of bridge building in our country.

　　Fighting the Floods

　　This bridge-building team arrived here after completing the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Building this bridge, in terms of construction difficulty and complexity, was no less challenging than building the Yangtze River Bridge.

　　Soon after construction began, they encountered an unprecedented flood on the Yellow River, the worst in decades. People know that the Yellow River's character differs from the Yangtze River. The Yellow River is like an untamed steed; when floods come, they are turbulent and unstoppable. However, the bridge builders deeply understood the significance of building this bridge for developing the national economy and accelerating socialist construction. Therefore, to save time and complete the bridge ahead of schedule, they launched a courageous struggle against the floods.

　　Just as the construction lines were laid and everything was ready to sink the caissons in the river, a flood suddenly arrived. Even the wild rabbits on the river滩 had nowhere to escape and were forced onto the tracks and into the work sheds by the flood. But the heroes persisted in sinking the caissons. They only retreated when the flood was about to submerge the tracks. They all knew clearly that if the flood washed away this set of machinery and materials, it would be like surrendering to the Yellow River. This would not only cause a loss of national resources but also delay the bridge's construction time by having to obtain another set of equipment. Thus, cadres and workers fearlessly jumped into the water to rescue the machinery and materials, and even the family members of the employees joined in. After a battle, they finally withdrew the machinery and materials to the riverbank.

　　On July 16, 1958, the Yellow River saw a particularly large flood peak. Before all the gantry cranes could be moved back to the riverbank, the tracks were submerged by the flood. In an instant, they were shaking violently, and people didn't even dare walk on them. The workers used wooden rafts to transport large amounts of rubble, throwing it beside the gantry cranes to prevent them from being washed away. Communist Party members Xiao Chuanren, Xu Jinju, and worker Hu Jiaqing stayed on the gantry cranes from morning till evening to protect the equipment. However, the flood was getting bigger and bigger, and they could no longer return to the riverbank. Engineering Section Chief Xu Daming tried to swim over to save them with a lifebuoy, but he failed several times. Liu Jinlan, secretary of the Party Committee of the Bridge Engineering Office, and Zhang Hongcun, deputy director of the Engineering Office, and other leading cadres stood on the bank, watching these beloved comrades with great anxiety. If they waited until night, and the water became even greater, the three of them would be in danger. At this critical moment, the Party Committee of the Bridge Engineering Office decided to mobilize the masses to find a way and take emergency measures to rescue them. At this time, workers who knew how to swim volunteered to go into the water. Later, from dozens of swimmers, Li Mingzhong, Deng Zutian, Liu Hengshan, and other skilled swimmers who could cross the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers were selected to go down and rescue them. How thrilling this was! They jumped into the raging torrent together, holding onto a wooden raft, and swam towards the gantry crane. The comrades on the shore were expecting them, encouraging them. Some of them were swept away by the big waves, and just as people were worried, they struggled back up. They slowly swam to the gantry crane, using a roundabout method, and brought Xiao Chuanren, Xu Jinju, and Hu Jiaqing ashore.

　　In this way, during the flood season on the Yellow River, they fought the floods "seven times in and seven times out." Finally, they learned the Yellow River's temperament and found reliable construction methods, laying a favorable foundation for accelerating the completion of the Yellow River Bridge.

　　Wisely Unraveling the "Secret" of the Riverbed

　　The flood season passed, and a sand island emerged in the middle of the Yellow River. To reduce the time spent traveling back and forth, some workers simply lived, ate, and slept on the riverbed, establishing a construction base on this sand island. The Party Committee of the Engineering Office also established a frontline command post on the sand island. All projects were proceeding rapidly. However, a new difficulty arose: the caissons, when sunk to a deeper layer, encountered a "stalemate" phenomenon, with some stuck for more than ten days without moving. At that time, it took forty-seven days to sink a bridge pier foundation caisson. How slow this was! If it continued like this, when would all seventy-two bridge piers be sunk? The workers were very anxious, and some even lost their appetite, staying at the construction site all day. What exactly was hindering the caissons from sinking? This was a secret.

　　The south bank of the bridge site is close to Mangshan Mountain, with the historical "Yu the Great's Old Course" upstream and the famous Huayuankou dangerous section downstream. Floods pass through Qinchuan and Sanmenxia, clinging to the Mangshan ridge, and are discharged into the plains from here through narrow river channels. The river flow here is particularly rapid, the riverbed changes unpredictably, and the riverbed geology is very complex. In 1919, nineteen Chinese and foreign bridge companies, hoping to make a fortune here, ultimately saw their plans fall through because they could not sink the bridge piers. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries also hired American experts twice to build a new bridge here. As a result, they were swindled out of $100,000, and the bridge was still nowhere to be seen. However, these difficulties did not stop the brave and wise heroes of today.

　　After the caisson sinking reached a stalemate, the Party Committee of the Bridge Engineering Office believed that this was the key to rapid construction and specifically convened a meeting to study ways to solve the problem. Before construction, the riverbed had been explored, and the locations of hard soil layers were known. What was the reason for not being able to sink them now? They clearly knew that there were only things in nature that people had not yet recognized, and there were no unknowable "secrets." As long as it was put into practice, it could be known. Therefore, they decided to "take sinking caissons as the key" to inspire the masses to break superstitions, encourage daring to think and daring to act, carry out creative labor, and launch a red flag competition. At this time, leading cadres such as the Party Committee Secretary, Party Committee members, and Chief Engineer were all assigned responsibility, taking charge of a team or a work shift, personally going deep into the site and studying with the workers. Any experience gained was immediately summarized, improved, and promoted. After a period of practice, Team Three on the north bank created the "sucking and hitting" method, and Team Two on the south bank created the "lifting and hitting" method. At this time, the Party Committee again convened engineering teams from both banks to study and analyze together, exchanging experiences, and finally realized the particularity of the soil in the lower layer of the riverbed. The soil quality in the lower layer of the river here has a strong resilience. If the caisson sinking is paused for a long time in the deep layer, it will be more and more difficult to sink. The caisson is like being inserted into a thick piece of rubber, which cannot be pulled out or inserted. In this way, the "secret" of the riverbed was revealed. Later, according to this special soil and the construction experience already gained on both banks, a set of effective construction methods was collectively summarized, and a special equipment was created. Using this method of sinking caissons greatly accelerated the speed of sinking caissons, shortening the time from forty-seven days to sink one pier to five or six days to sink one pier.

　　Night Battles in Severe Winter

　　Winter came, and the severe cold and sandstorms in the Yellow River replaced the terrible floods. Sometimes when the sandstorms blew, people couldn't even see each other across from them, and in a moment, people and machines were covered with a thick layer of sand and soil. The temperature in the riverbed was seven or eight degrees lower than on the shore. Once, when a force six or seven gale blew, people working on the sand island, not to mention working at high altitudes, would lose their way even when leaving the work shed. The project was forced to stop. Days passed, and the gale continued to blow. The workers were talking anxiously: "Are we waiting for the gift of nature? Or are we fighting the wind and sand?"

　　One night, the Feng Sen work shift on the north bank couldn't bear it any longer and came to the construction site. A force seven gale was raging, the sand and soil were everywhere, and the powerful floodlights became dim and dull. People on the trestle bridge were staggering as if they were drunk. They struggled to reach the pile driver, seized the gap in the gale, started the machine and continued construction. At this time, it was already minus fifteen degrees Celsius, and there was ice everywhere on the steel structure platform. The sprayed water was blown everywhere by the wind, and people's eyebrows and clothes were covered with ice. When foreman Feng Sen walked, he made a rustling sound, and he simply became an "ice man." Looking at the determined and calm expression on his face and the bright icicles on his body, the workers jokingly said that he was wearing "gem armor." The caisson began to sink slowly again, and smiles appeared on people's faces again, shouting loudly "It's sinking, we won." Because of the joy of overcoming the wind and sand, they forgot to eat their supper and worked until dawn. The news of overcoming the wind and sand quickly spread throughout the entire construction site. From then on, the wind and sand could no longer stop the heroes building the Yellow River Bridge.

　　Huang Jiguang-style Heroes

　　On December 23, 1958, the Second Group of the Third Class on the south bank was sinking the foundation caisson of the No. 68 bridge pier. At night, it was drizzling, the rain getting heavier and heavier, and finally turned into white snowflakes. The construction site was covered with silver flowers. Everyone was covered with a thin layer of ice. At the tense moment of sinking the caisson, suddenly a bang of explosion was heard, and the inner water pipe burst. Under the water pressure of thirteen kilograms, the water shot upwards like a string of beads, hitting the motor of the pile driver directly. At this time, every worker clearly understood that if the motor was damp, work would have to be stopped for at least ten days for repairs, which would seriously affect the work. At that time, the person closest to the rope ladder took a step forward and quickly climbed to the high altitude. This was Du Chengxiang, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch and a Communist Party member. Duan Qingfu, Zhang Yuanlin, Guo Zhongwen and other four people followed him up. Comrade Du Chengxiang unhesitatingly used his body and coat to protect the motor, and the water splashed everywhere on him. By the time the others had repaired the pipe, the five of them's clothes had quickly frozen into icicles. The pile driver roared again, although it was bone-chilling cold, their hearts were warm. They were therefore called "Huang Jiguang-style heroes" by the people on the construction site.

　　The bridge has been built, and when the workers were celebrating the victory, a worker facing the Yellow River sang:

　　Yellow River, Yellow River, don't be fierce, there are heroes by your side; unafraid of wind, snow, and waves, building a rainbow on your back. The heroic achievements created by this bridge-building team here will be eternally remembered.

    智斗激流架长虹
    本报记者　刘健生
    郑州黄河大桥建成了。建设者们正在向这座雄伟壮丽的大桥挥手告别。他们有的将去济南，有的将去南京，也有的将去芜湖，那里有新的桥梁工程在等待着他们。
    从长江到黄河，从黄河再到长江，同江河搏斗，用自己的辛勤、智慧和勇敢，为广大人民造福，对于这支桥梁队伍来说，已经习以为常了。他们在这里，经历和克服了重重困难，和洪水、严寒、风沙进行了英勇的斗争。用不到两年的时间，建成了这座永久性的双线铁路桥梁，比国家计划提前半年完成了建桥任务，为我国的桥梁史上增加了光辉的一页。
    与洪水搏斗
    这支桥梁队伍，是完成武汉长江大桥建桥任务以后来到这里的。建设这座大桥，从施工的艰巨性和复杂性来看，并不亚于修建长江大桥。
    工程开工不久，就碰上了黄河几十年来未有的特大洪水。人们都知道，黄河的性格是和长江不同的。黄河，像一只不易驯服的骏马，洪水来了，汹涌澎湃，势不可当。但是，大桥的建设者们，深刻地认识到建设这座大桥对于发展国民经济，加快社会主义建设具有重大的意义。因此，为了争取时间，提前建成大桥，便和洪水开展了英勇的斗争。
    刚刚把施工的线路铺好，一切都准备妥当，正要在河中下沉管柱了，突然来了洪水。那时，连河滩上的野兔都无处逃避，被洪水逼上线路和工棚里来了。但是，英雄们还是坚持下沉管柱。直到洪水快要淹没线路才开始撤退。他们都清楚地知道，如果叫洪水把这一套机具、材料冲走，就等于向黄河交械，这不仅会使国家资材遭受损失，而且另去搞一套就会延迟建桥的时间。于是，干部、工人就奋不顾身跳进水中抢救机具和材料，连职工的家属也参加了。经过一场搏斗，终于把机具、材料撤回河岸。
    那是在1958年7月16日，黄河出现了特大的洪峰。还没来得及把全部龙门吊机撤回河岸，线路就被洪水淹没了。霎时间，冲得摇摇晃晃，连人都不敢在上面行走。工人就用木伐运进大量的片石，投在龙门吊机的旁边，使其不被冲走。共产党员萧川仁、徐金矩和工人胡家清三人，为了保护机具，没有上岸，他们从早上一直到傍晚守在龙门吊机上。可是洪水越来越大了，已经无法回到河岸。工程科长许达明，曾带着一个救生圈想游过去救他们，但是，几次下水都没有成功。大桥工程处党委书记刘金兰和工程处副处长张虹村等领导干部，都站在岸边，望着这些可爱的同志，心里十分焦虑。如果，等到夜间，水势再大，他们三人就有生命的危险。在这紧要的关头，大桥工程处党委会决定，发动职工群众想办法，采取紧急措施，一定把他们抢救上岸。这时候，会水的工人都自动报名下水，后来，从几十个会水的人当中，挑选了能横渡长江、黄河的李明忠、邓祖田、刘恒山等几名游泳的能手，下去抢救。这是多么惊心动魄的事情啊！他们一起跳进滚滚的急流中，抱着一个木伐，向龙门吊机游去，岸上的同志们都在期望着他们，鼓舞着他们，他们有的被大浪卷下去了，正在使人担心的时候，又挣扎上来。他们用迂回的办法，慢慢游到了龙门吊机跟前，把萧川仁、许金矩、胡家清一齐接上了岸。
    就这样，他们在黄河的洪水期间，和洪水干了个“七进七出”。终于，摸到黄河的脾气，找到可靠的施工方法，为加快建成黄河大桥打下了有利的基础。
    智破河底“秘密”
    洪水季节过去了，黄河中间露出来一个沙岛，为了减少往返走路的时间，有一部分工人干脆住在河下，吃在河下，睡在河下，在这个沙岛上建立了一个施工基地。工程处党委，也在沙岛上建立了施工前线指挥部。一切工程都在飞快地进行着。可是，这时又遇到了一个新的困难，就是管柱下到深层，发生了“顶牛”现象，有的僵持十几天，还是原封不动。那时下沉一个桥墩基础管柱，需要四十七天。这是多么慢呀，如果照这样下去，全桥七十二个桥墩，得什么时候才能下沉完呢？工人们都很着急，有些人连饭也吃不下去，整天守在工地上，究竟是什么东西阻碍着管柱下不进去呢？这是一个秘密。
    桥址南岸紧靠邙山头，上游是历史上的“禹王故道”，下游是有名的花园口险工地段。洪水经过秦川、三门峡，紧贴着邙山岭，由狭窄的河道，从这里倾泻平原。这里河流特别急，河道变迁莫测，河床地质非常复杂。1919年，想在这儿发一笔横财的十九家中外桥梁公司，都由于无法下桥墩终于使他们的计划成为泡影。以后，国民党反动派也曾两次请来美国专家在这里建设新桥。结果，骗走了十万美元，桥还是无影无踪。但是，这些困难没有阻挡住今天有勇有智的英雄们。
    下沉管柱发生僵持局面以后，大桥工程处党委会认为这是快速施工的关键，就专门召开会议研究解决这个问题的办法。在施工以前，河床是经过勘探的，在什么地方有硬土层也都知道，现在打不下去是什么原因？他们清楚地知道，自然界只有人们尚未认识的东西，是没有不可知道的“秘密”的，只要通过实践是可以知道的。因此，决定“以下沉管柱为纲”启发职工群众破除迷信，鼓励敢想、敢干，进行创造性的劳动，并开展红旗竞赛。这时，党委书记、党委委员、总工程师等领导干部，都分工负责，包一个队或一个工班，亲自深入现场和工人一块研究；有一点经验就立即总结、提高和推广。经过一段实践，北岸三队创造出“吸吸打打”的方法，南岸二队创造出“提提打打”的方法。这时党委又召集两岸的工程队在一块研究分析，互相交流经验，终于认识到河床下层土壤的特殊性。这里河下层的土质，恢复性很强，如果管柱下沉到深层中途停顿时间越久就越打不下去；管柱就好像插在一块厚厚的胶皮上一样，拔不出来，也插不进去。就这样揭开了河底的“秘密”。后来，根据这种特殊的土壤和两岸已经取得的施工经验，又集体总结出一套有效的施工方法，并且创造出一种特殊的设备。用这种下沉管柱的方法，大大加快了下沉管柱的速度，由过去四十七天下沉一个墩子，缩短到五、六天下沉一个墩子。
    严冬夜战
    冬季来到了，黄河中的严寒和大风沙代替了可怕的洪水。有时风沙刮起来，对面都不见人，不一会，人和机具都蒙上了一层厚厚的沙土，河下的温度要比岸上低七、八度。有一次刮起六、七级的大风，在沙岛上工作的人们，别说在高空作业，连人离开工棚都会迷失方向。工程被迫停下来了。时间一天一天的过去，大风还是不停地刮着。工人们以焦急的心情在谈论着：“我们是等待自然的恩赐？还是和风沙战斗？”
    一天夜里，北岸冯森工班忍不住了，来到了工地。七级大风在怒吼，沙土弥漫，光线强大的照明灯，变得暗淡无光，人在栈桥上，像喝醉了酒，摇摇晃晃。他们挣扎着来到了打桩机前，抓住大风的间隙开动机器继续施工。这时，已是摄氏零下十五度，钢结构平台上到处是冰凌，喷射出来的水，被风吹得到处飞溅，人们的眉毛上、衣服上都结了冰。工长冯森走起路来，刷拉刷拉地响，简直成了“冰人”。看着他脸上那种坚毅沉着的表情和身上明亮的冰溜，工人们风趣地说他穿上了“宝石盔甲”。管柱又开始徐徐下沉了，人们的脸上又露出了笑容，高声地喊着“下沉了，我们胜利了”。由于战胜大风沙的喜悦心情，他们忘记了去吃夜餐，一直干到天亮。战胜大风沙的消息，很快传遍了整个工地。从此，大风沙，再也不能阻拦建设黄河大桥的英雄们了。
    黄继光式的英雄
    1958年12月23日，南岸三班二组下沉第六十八号桥墩基础管柱。入夜，下着蒙蒙的细雨，雨越下越大，最后终于变成了白茫茫的雪片。工地上披上银花。人们的身上也都结了一层薄冰。正在下沉管柱紧张的时刻，忽听拍的一声爆炸，内射水管破裂了。在十三公斤的水压下，水像连珠炮一样，向上猛射，正好对着打桩机的马达冲去。在这个时候，每个工人都清楚地了解到，如果马达受潮，至少要停工修理十几天，这样将要使工作受到严重的影响。当时一个离软梯最近的人，一步抢先，迅速爬上高空，这是共青团支部书记、共产党员杜成祥同志。紧跟着他上去的还有段清福、张远林和郭忠文等四人。杜成祥同志毫不犹豫地用自己身体和大衣掩护了马达，水打在他身上四处飞溅；等到其他人把管子修理好，五个人衣服很快结成了冰凌。打桩机又轰轰地响起来了，虽然冷得刺骨，但他们心里都是热的。他们因此被工地的人们称为“黄继光式的英雄”。
    大桥已经建设起来了，工人们在庆祝胜利的时候，有个工人面对着黄河唱道：
    黄河，黄河，你别凶，你的身旁有英雄；不怕风雪和风浪，在你背上架长虹。这支桥梁队伍，在这里创造的英雄业迹，将永留人间。
