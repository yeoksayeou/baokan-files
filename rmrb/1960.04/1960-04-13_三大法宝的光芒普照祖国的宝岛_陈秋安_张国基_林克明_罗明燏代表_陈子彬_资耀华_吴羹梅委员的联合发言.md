Comrades Chen Qiu'an, Zhang Guoji, Lin Keming, and Luo Mingyu, Deputies, and Comrades Chen Zibin, Zi Yaohua, and Wu Gengmei jointly speak:

    We fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program.
    During this inspection trip, in addition to visiting Foshan, Xinhui, Maoming, and Zhanjiang in Guangdong, we also went to Hainan Island. In a short five days of whirlwind tour, we saw a wealth of new things and received a profound socialist education.
    As everyone knows, Hainan Island has a rather long revolutionary history. From 1928, the second year after the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed the revolution, the Chinese Communist Party established red bases on Hainan Island, raised the unyielding red flag, organized the Red Army, and persisted in the struggle. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it established anti-Japanese bases to resist the Japanese invaders. In 1950, the Qiongya Column cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberate the entire island. Over the ten years since liberation, the face of Hainan Island has completely changed. Starting from Haikou, we traveled along the east coast through Lingshui to Yulin, and then traversed the Wuzhi Mountain area through the Songtao Reservoir and Nada back to Haikou. As the car sped through this beautiful landscape, we saw a scene of prosperity everywhere.
    The General Line has similarly emitted boundless radiance on Hainan Island. We visited the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in Lingshui County on the east coast. Farm Director Zhan Lizhi told us that Xinglong area is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with a hot climate, abundant rainfall, and extremely rich tropical resources. Before liberation, malaria was rampant, threatening human life, to the point where no one dared to go there, and the land was desolate. In October 1951, the first group of more than 700 returned overseas Chinese from Malaya came here and started from scratch. Starting from collective leadership and individual operation, the government accepted the masses' request to establish a collective farm in September 1952 in order to better resist typhoons and droughts. Over the years, the number of returned overseas Chinese from seventeen countries has increased to more than 7,000 (96% of whom are overseas Chinese), reclaiming more than 70,000 mu of wasteland. According to the instructions of the Hainan District Party Committee, production has been developed in accordance with the principle of focusing on tropical crops, using short-term gains to support long-term development, combining long-term and short-term projects, and diversifying operations. The farm has also established more than 20 factories, including factories for citronella processing, sisal processing, oil extraction, brick and tile production, machinery, power generation, and fertilizer production. Since the promulgation of the General Line for Socialist Construction, all the farm's employees have been working with full enthusiasm, striving for the top, promoting industry and agriculture simultaneously, and making continuous leaps forward, achieving amazing results. This year's plan is to reclaim 60,000 to 80,000 mu of wasteland, which is equal to the total amount of the previous nine years; last year's total output value was more than 4 million yuan, and this year it is expected to increase to 8 to 9 million yuan; last year's profit payment was more than 1 million yuan, and this year's plan is to pay more than 3 million yuan. The total investment in this farm is more than 3 million yuan, which is the resettlement and production expenses issued by the government to the returned overseas Chinese, and no special funds have been allocated separately. From 1951 to 1952, the average annual wage per able-bodied worker was 120 yuan, and now it has increased to 500 yuan. We also visited the overseas Chinese who were recently forced to return from Indonesia. This group has more than 100 people, all of whom have moved into the farm and live in the new dormitories vacated by the staff. They are grateful for the care of the Party and the government and immediately plunged into production without enough rest. We visited the Xinglong Farm for most of the day, like walking in a green ocean, and saw many trees, grasses, flowers, and fruits that we had never seen before, which made people dazzled and excited. Wiping the sweat from our foreheads, we looked at the blue sky lined with bananas and coconut trees, and deeply felt the greatness of the motherland, silently chanting "Long live the General Line," and our hearts were extremely happy.
    We also visited the Songtao Reservoir. This reservoir is mainly for irrigation, supplemented by power generation, and combined with shipping. On the land irrigated by it, tropical crops such as rubber, sisal, sugarcane, and oil palm can be planted, and after planting, the income can be more than 200 million yuan per year. The construction of the reservoir only started in September 1958, and it was completed last year for flood control and will be completed this year. It is entirely built by implementing the principle of walking on two legs, with indigenous methods as the main method, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. When we arrived at the reservoir it was already evening, and Luo Wenhong, the director of the reservoir engineering bureau, led us to the top of the dam. We saw trucks transporting stone materials shuttling back and forth under the illumination of electric lights, and thousands upon thousands of migrant workers working selflessly. Some of them were taking soil from two kilometers away with handcarts and hurrying back and forth; some were helping other migrant workers push the carts uphill with cheers like thunder; some were watering the ground to prepare for the rolling tractors, especially the female migrant workers, who were also pushing the soil carts briskly, which was really admirable. The conveyor belt for transporting soil was only 300 meters long and had only recently been installed. Visiting this huge earth dam built by tens of thousands of migrant workers with their diligent hands, we deeply understood that the General Line truly concentratedly reflects the ardent desire of our 650 million people to quickly change the situation of "poverty and blankness" and build our country into a powerful socialist country.
    The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward were everywhere in our ears and eyes. We passed through Tongshi in the Wuzhi Mountain area, which was originally the seat of the People's Committee of the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Before liberation, there were only a few thatched houses here, but today it is already the prototype of a beautiful new city. Office buildings, exhibition halls, auditoriums, banks, post and telecommunications bureaus, department stores, canteens, etc. are all available. The wide roads, newly built houses, the bridge across the river, and the coconut trees shading the sun are all refreshing. "Poverty and blankness can draw the most beautiful pictures," this profound truth gave us a further understanding when we arrived at Tongshi. In this Wuzhi Mountain area, before liberation, lived about 400,000 hardworking and brave Li people who had suffered from the oppression and killing of successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and their lives now are truly different from the past. According to reports, the Tongshi Red Flag People's Commune had backward production before liberation, practicing slash-and-burn cultivation, and generally lacked food for four or five months each year; now, each person has an average of 670 jin of grain. In terms of clothing, before liberation, they wore self-woven linen, mostly ragged, women wore Li barrel skirts, men only had a loincloth, and children were naked all year round. Now, women wear floral cloth clothes and have changed into Han trousers, and men, women, and children can add two or three sets of new clothes every year. Before liberation, they lived in boat-shaped thatched huts, dark and gloomy, with bamboo frames inside, which were both the floor and the family's bed; now, they have rebuilt relatively spacious and tall Han-style thatched houses. Before liberation, they were superstitious about ghosts and gods, diseases were rampant, and the mortality rate was extremely high. A saying circulated among the Li people was: "Only see women pregnant, but don't see children running in the village"; now there are hospitals and maternity hospitals, and they have already sent the four "plague gods" - malaria, smallpox, cholera, and neonatal tetanus - to the sky. Before liberation, unscrupulous merchants deceived them by saying, "It's easy to raise a chicken, but it takes a lot of effort to grind an iron pillar into a needle, and you still have to make a small eye in the needle. How can it be done without the skillful hands of a fairy?" Therefore, a chicken could only be exchanged for a needle, a pig could only be exchanged for a knife, and a cow could only be exchanged for one or two plows; now this Red Flag People's Commune of more than 14,000 people has agricultural machinery factories, non-staple food processing factories, building materials factories, and tea factories, with 375 workers, and can already export agricultural tools and manufacture machines. The Li people said that without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no good days today. The changes in the past ten years are indeed not only leaps forward, but also leaps, and they have leaped from the early stages of feudal society to socialist society. This is a victory for the Party's ethnic policy and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    We also visited the Xilian State Farm in Nada. This farm started operating at the end of 1952 and has planted more than 50,000 mu of tropical crops. The construction fund was 4.2 million yuan, and by last year, the profit paid to the state had reached 5.39 million yuan, with 3.75 million yuan paid in the two years since the Great Leap Forward. Since 1958, the staff of this farm has given full play to the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and achieved many new and significant achievements.
    The unparalleled superiority of the people's communes and their development prospects gave us further understanding. On the way from Haikou to Xinglong Farm, we visited the Dalu People's Commune. According to Peng Shifeng, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, the commune has a population of 25,365 and a cultivated area of 81,505 mu. After the commune was established in the second half of 1958, both agriculture and industry made great leaps forward. In terms of agriculture, in 1959, 23.62 million jin of rice were harvested, an increase of 56% compared to 1958. Economic crops such as coffee, sugarcane, and bananas were planted on a total of 18,195 mu, an increase of 200% compared to 1958. After the commune was established, the industrial sector developed even faster, with 196 factories of various sizes, including agricultural machinery, fertilizer, non-staple food processing, brick and tile, and citronella processing. The output value in 1959 was 870,000 yuan. The income from sideline production was 790,000 yuan, an increase of 113% compared to before the commune was established. The total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 was 6.74 million yuan, an increase of 79% compared to before the commune was established, and the planned total industrial and agricultural output value for this year is 10 million yuan. There are 14 hydroelectric power stations, which will all be completed this year, generating 1,200 kilowatts of electricity. 61,000 mu of farmland have been irrigated, and 80% can be irrigated, basically eliminating drought. In 1959, the average distribution per person was 107 yuan, an increase of 40% compared to 1958. This commune is a pilot project for implementing the basic ownership system of the commune. In 1959, the industrial and agricultural output value at the commune level reached 1.72 million yuan, accounting for 32% of the commune's total industrial and agricultural output value. We visited the commune's farmland and experimental fields, where the rice ears were waving in the wind.
    We also visited the Luhuitou State Farm near Yulin. This was only converted from a commune to a farm at the end of last year. Currently, the farm has only 131 households and 642 people, 80% to 90% of whom are Li people, and it still needs to be expanded. Due to a series of democratic reforms after liberation, the establishment of cooperatives in 1957, and the establishment of communes in 1958, the ethnic contradictions before liberation and the class contradictions within the Li ethnic group have been basically resolved. After the production relations changed, production increased sharply. In 1959, the average income per person was 150 yuan, and the days of lack of food and clothing before liberation are gone forever. The people of all ethnic groups are grateful for the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. In order to build socialism faster and better use the collective strength to transform nature and improve economic and cultural life, they unanimously requested to be converted into a state farm. The above facts show that no matter which village in the motherland, the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes is demonstrated. As for the increasing and expanding of state farms, and the excellent results achieved by the basic ownership system of the commune in the first year, it further inspires us that in the near future, the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in our country's rural areas will be an inevitable trend.
    Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in their reports: "The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three magic weapons for the entire period of socialist construction in our country, and they are the products of Mao Zedong Thought." "Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction." Although we only inspected Hainan Island for a few days, we saw and heard countless new things and felt particularly close to the above words of the two vice premiers. We firmly believe that the power of these three magic weapons will continue to grow, Mao Zedong Thought will move from victory to greater victory, and will surely lead the people of all ethnic groups in our China to the happy avenue of communist society. Under the guidance of the Party and the leadership of the working people, we also assure Chairman Mao that we will wholeheartedly listen to your words, wholeheartedly follow the Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, and wholeheartedly serve socialism.
    Comrades! Hainan Island is not only the treasure island of the motherland, but also the forefront of the motherland's defense. Due to its geographical location, it is also a treasure island in the socialist camp. It is not only suitable for cultivating a large number of precious tropical crops such as rubber (for example, if the output value of 800 jin of rice per mu is 100, then rubber is 547, oil palm is 385, sisal is 230, coffee is 490, and pepper is 2400), and rice can be harvested three times a year; it also has rich mineral deposits; forests account for 40% of the island's total area, and there are natural pastures, suitable for the development of animal husbandry. In the early days of liberation, the output of pigs, cattle, and poultry accounted for more than 76% of the total output; the Beibu Gulf fishing ground is one of the three major fishing grounds in our country; and the output of the Yinggehai Salt Field is also very large. These rich resources of industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery urgently need us to vigorously develop. The Party and the government have detailed plans for the development of Hainan Island, but the task is arduous and requires strong support from all parties. Now, based on what we have seen and heard, we would like to put forward the following superficial opinions for reference and correction by relevant departments:
    (1) Reclamation - Hainan currently has only more than 6 million mu of cultivated farmland. In order to fully cultivate tropical crops, it will reclaim 20 million mu of wasteland, and must complete the reclamation within three years. Mechanization is essential, and a large number of tractors must be supported. (2) Water conservancy - Hainan's terrain is high in the middle and low all around, with heavy and concentrated rainfall, which is easy to lose. The development plan proposes to build 19 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 19.77 billion cubic meters, which can irrigate an area of about 8.95 million mu and have a power generation capacity of 507,500 kilowatts. Relevant parties must actively cooperate to supply equipment and build them in advance. (3) Transportation - The island railway must be built. Although the Xihai'an railway currently under construction has been opened from Yulin to Huangliu, it will not be built to Haikou until the year after next. The route is not long, and it seems that consideration should be given to completing it in advance. The shipping around the island is easy, and docks can be built and ships purchased as soon as possible to vigorously develop. (4) Human resources - Hainan is the second largest island in our country, with a vast area and sparse population (Taiwan has an area of 36,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 10 million, while Hainan has an area of 33,556 square kilometers and a population of 3.05 million). A large number of immigrants from the mainland are urgently needed to enrich the labor force so that we can develop the rich resources in a timely manner. (5) Returned overseas Chinese - Overseas Chinese were forced to go abroad to make a living before liberation and became orphans overseas. Now that the motherland is strong, many people are willing to return. Hainan is an ideal hometown for overseas Chinese. Currently, Indonesia is discriminating against Chinese, and a large number of overseas Chinese are returning. They mostly have experience in operating tropical crops and should be resettled in Hainan as soon as possible so that they can give full play to their strengths and make contributions to the motherland.
    Comrades! The treasure island of the motherland - Hainan Island must be vigorously developed. We firmly believe that under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Party, and with the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the development of Hainan Island will surely continue to make great leaps forward with the support of the people of the whole country and all relevant parties, and realize the great feat of conquering nature and transforming nature, making Hainan Island a true treasure island of the motherland.

    三大法宝的光芒普照祖国的宝岛
    陈秋安　张国基  林克明　罗明燏代表  陈子彬  资耀华  吴羹梅委员的联合发言
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。
    我们这次借视察工作的机会，除了到广东佛山、新会、茂名、湛江各地参观外，还到海南岛去了一次，用了短短五天的时间走马看花，看到的新鲜事物非常丰富，受到了极为深刻的社会主义教育。
    大家知道，海南岛的革命历史是相当悠久的。从国民党反动派叛变革命的第二年即1928年起，中国共产党就在海南岛建立了红色根据地，升起了不倒的红旗，组织红军，坚持斗争，抗日战争期间又建立了抗日根据地抗击日寇。到1950年琼崖纵队配合解放大军击溃了国民党反动派，解放了全岛。解放十年来，海南岛的面貌已完全改观。我们从海口出发沿东海岸经陵水到榆林，又纵贯五指山区经松涛水库和那大回到海口，汽车奔驰在这秀丽的山川原野中，看到的真是一片兴隆气象。
    总路线在海南岛同样发出了万丈光芒。我们在东海岸参观了陵水县国营兴隆华侨农场。詹力之场长告诉我们，兴隆地区背山面海，气候热，雨量多，热带资源十分丰富。解放前疟疾流行，威胁人的生命，以至无人敢去，遍地荒凉。1951年10月有第一批自马来亚归来的难侨七百多人到此，白手起家。从集体领导个体经营开始，为了更好地抵抗台风和旱灾，政府接受了群众要求于1952年9月成立集体农场。这些年来自十七个国家归来的华侨已增加到七千多人（其中96％是华侨），开垦了荒地七万多亩。根据海南区党委指示，按照以热带作物为主，以短养长，长短结合，多种经营的方针发展了生产。农场还办工厂二十余个，有香茅加工，剑麻加工，榨油、砖瓦、机械、发电、肥料等厂。自从社会主义建设总路线公布后，全场职工鼓足干劲，力争上游，工农并举，连年跃进，取得了惊人的成就。今年开荒的计划是六万到八万亩，等于以往九年的总数；去年总产值四百多万元，今年提高到八、九百万元；去年上缴一百多万元，今年计划上缴三百多万元。这个农场的总投资是三百多万元，就是政府发给归侨的安家和生产费，并未另拨专款。在1951年至1952年，全劳动力每人每年工资平均为一百二十元，现在已增加到五百元。我们还访问了最近到农场的由印度尼西亚被迫归国的华侨，这一批有一百多人，都搬进农场，住在职工腾让出来的新宿舍中。他们感激党和政府的照顾，未经足够的休息，就立即投入生产。我们在兴隆农场参观了大半天，像穿行在绿色的海洋中，看到不少未曾见过的树草花果，使人眼花缭乱，精神兴奋。我们擦着额角的汗水，望着香蕉、椰树衬托着的蔚蓝色的天空，深深地感到祖国的伟大，默默地念着总路线万岁，内心愉快万分。
    我们还参观了松涛水库。这个水库以灌溉为主，发电为副，结合航运。在它灌溉的土地上，可种橡胶、剑麻、甘蔗、油棕等热带作物，种植后一年可有收益两亿多元。水库的工程在1958年9月才开始，去年完成拦洪，今年完工，完全是贯彻两条腿走路的方针，以土法为主，土洋结合干起来的。当我们到达水库时已是晚间，水库工程局的罗文洪局长引我们登到坝顶。但见在电灯光线的照耀下运石料的卡车来去如梭，成千上万的民工在忘我地劳动。他们有的从两公里外用手推车取土往返奔忙；有的用欢呼如雷鸣的巨声帮助别的民工推车上坡；有的用水浇地来为碾压拖拉机做好准备工作，特别是女民工们同样地推着土车健步如飞，真是令人惊服。运土用的皮带仅有三百米，还是刚装好不久。参观了这几万民工用勤劳的双手筑成的巨大土坝，使我们深切地理解到总路线确是集中地反映了我国六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况，把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家的热烈愿望。
    大跃进的丰功伟绩到处传入我们的耳目。我们经过原来是黎族、苗族自治州人民委员会的所在地——五指山区的通什。解放前，这里仅有几间草房，可是今天已经是一个美丽的新城市的雏形了。办公大楼、展览馆、大礼堂、银行、邮电局、百货商店、食堂等都已具备。宽阔的马路，新建的房屋，横跨河溪的大桥，绿荫遮日的椰树，令人心旷神怡。一穷二白，可以画最美丽的图画，这句至理名言，到通什使我们有了进一步的体会。在这五指山区，解放前居住着的是饱受历代封建皇朝和国民党反动政权压迫残杀的约四十万勤劳勇敢的黎族人民，现在的生活和以往真是判若天壤。据了解，通什红旗人民公社在解放以前生产落后，刀耕火种，一般每年缺粮四、五个月；现在平均每人已有口粮六百七十斤谷。穿衣方面，解放前穿的是自织的麻布，大都破破烂烂，女子着黎族桶裙，男子只有一块遮羞布，儿童长年光身，现在女子穿上花布衣，换穿了汉族的裤子，男女老幼每年都可以添两三套新衣。解放前住船形茅棚，黑洞洞，里面用竹子编成架，是地板也是一家人的床；现在改建了比较宽大高敞的汉族样式的茅屋。解放前迷信鬼神，疾病流行，死亡率极大，黎族人民流传的一句话是：“只见女人怀孩子，不见村里小孩跑”；现在有了医院和妇产院，已经把四位“瘟神”——疟疾、天花、霍乱和初生儿破伤风送上了天。解放前奸商欺骗他们说：“养只鸡容易，要把一根铁柱磨成针，得花多大功夫，还得在针上打个小眼，非神仙巧手怎能行？”因此，一只鸡只能换一根针，一只猪只能换一把刀，一只牛只能换一两张犁；现在这个一万四千多人的红旗人民公社已有农械厂、副食品加工厂、建筑材料厂和茶叶厂，有工人三百七十五人，已能输出农具、制造机器。黎族人民说，没有共产党、毛主席，没有今天的好日子，十年来的变化的确不仅是跃进，而是飞跃，他们已由封建社会的初期飞跃到社会主义社会了。这是党的民族政策的胜利，也是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们还参观了那大的国营西联农场。这个农场是1952年底开始经营的，已种热带作物五万多亩。建场资金四百二十万元，到去年为止上缴利润已达五百三十九万元，大跃进以来两年内上缴三百七十五万元。这个农场的职工从1958年以来，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做的精神，贯彻了农业八字宪法，取得了许多新的重大成就。
    人民公社的无比优越性和它的发展前景使我们获得进一步的认识。我们在从海口赴兴隆农场的途中，参观了大路人民公社。据该社党委书记彭世丰告诉我们，该社人口二万五千三百六十五人，耕地面积八万一千五百零五亩。1958年下半年公社化后，农业及工业均在大跃进中。农业方面，1959年稻谷收获二千三百六十二万斤，比1958年增加56％，经济作物如咖啡、甘蔗、香蕉等共种一万八千一百九十五亩，比1958年增加200％。公社化后，工业方面发展更快，有农械、肥料、副食品加工、砖瓦、香茅加工等大小一百九十六个工厂。1959年产值八十七万元。副业方面收入七十九万元，比公社化前增加113％。1959年工农业总产值六百七十四万元，比公社化前增加79％，今年工农业总产值计划为一千万元。水电站十四个，今年可全部完成，发电一千二百瓩。农田六万一千亩已水利化，80％可用水灌溉，基本上消灭了旱灾。1959年每人平均分配一百零七元，比1958年增加40％。这个公社是实行公社基本所有制的一个试点，1959年公社一级的工农业产值达一百七十二万元，占公社全部工农业产值的32％。我们参观了公社的农田、试验田中稻穗已在迎风招展。
    我们还在榆林附近参观了鹿回头国营农场。这是在去年年底才由公社转为农场的。目前该农场仅一百三十一户，六百四十二人，80％至90％为黎族人民，尚待扩充。由于解放后通过了一系列的民主改革，1957年成立合作社，1958年成立公社，解放前的民族矛盾和黎族本身的阶级矛盾都基本上获得解决，生产关系改变后生产激增，1959年每人平均收入已有一百五十元，解放前缺衣饿肚的日子已经一去不复返了。各族人民感激党和毛主席的恩情，为了更快地建设社会主义，更好地运用集体的力量改造自然，改善经济文化生活，就一致要求转为国营农场。以上的事实，说明了不论在祖国大地的那一个乡村，都显示出人民公社的无比优越性。至于国营农场的日益增加和扩大，公社基本所有制在第一年就获得优异的成绩，更启示了我们在不久的将来，我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，将是必然的趋势。
    李富春副总理和李先念副总理在报告中指出：“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国整个社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物。”“毛泽东思想是马克斯列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的典范。”我们在海南岛视察虽然只有几天，可是看到听到无数的新鲜事物，格外感觉到两位副总理所讲的以上的话是无比亲切。我们深信，这三大法宝的威力将日益增长，毛泽东思想将从胜利走向更大的胜利，一定会把我们中国的各族人民，引到共产主义社会的康乐大道。在党的教导和劳动人民的带动下，我们也向毛主席保证，一定要一心一意听您的话，一心一意跟着党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务。
    各位同志！海南岛不仅是祖国的宝岛，也是祖国的国防前哨。由于它的地理位置，也是社会主义阵营中的一个宝岛。它不仅适宜于培植大量橡胶等名贵热带作物（如以亩产八百斤稻谷的产值为一百，则橡胶为五百四十七，油棕为三百八十五，剑麻为二百三十，咖啡为四百九十，胡椒为二千四百），种稻年可三熟；并且还有丰富的矿藏；森林面积占全岛总面积的40％，有天然牧场，适宜畜牧业的发展。解放初期，猪、牛、家禽输出占输出总额76％以上；北部湾的渔场是我国三大渔场之一；莺歌海盐场产量也很大。这些工、矿和农、林、牧、副、渔的丰富资源，亟待我们大力开发。党和政府对于开发海南岛，已有详细规划，但任务艰巨，必须各方大力支援。现在就我们的管见所及，特提出下列几点肤浅意见，供有关部门参考和指正：
    （1）开荒——海南现有已耕农田仅六百余万亩，为了全力培植热带作物，将开荒二千万亩，并且要在三年内开荒完毕，非机械化无济于事，必须大量拖拉机支援。（2）水利——海南地势中间高四周低，雨量多而集中，易于流失，开发规划中拟修建水库十九个，总库容为一百九十一点七十七亿公方，可灌溉土地面积约八百九十五万余亩，发电能力有五十点七五万瓩，必须有关方面大力配合供应器材，提前修建。（3）交通——环岛铁路，必须修建，目前修建的西海岸铁路，由榆林至黄流虽已通车，修到海口还要等到后年。路线不长，似应考虑提前完成。环岛各港航运，轻而易举，尽可早日修建码头，购备轮船，大力发展。（4）人力——海南为我国第二大岛，地广人稀（台湾面积三万六千平方公里，人口约一千万以上，海南面积三万三千五百五十六平方公里，人口为三百零五万），亟待大陆大量移民，充实劳动力，才可及时开发富源。（5）归侨——华侨在解放前是被迫出外谋生，作了海外的孤儿，现在祖国强大，很多人愿意归来，海南是一个理想的侨乡，目前印尼排华，侨胞大批归来，他们大都有经营热带作物的经验，尤应尽先在海南安置，俾便发挥所长，为祖国作出贡献。
    同志们！祖国的宝岛——海南岛必须大力开发，我们深信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的领导下，有了群众的冲天干劲，海南岛的开发，一定能够在全国人民及各有关方面的支援下继续大跃进，实现征服自然，改造自然的伟举，使海南岛成为真正的祖国宝岛。
