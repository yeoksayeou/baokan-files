The three magic weapons are a reliable guarantee for victory.
Comrade Liu Dingwu's impressions from an inspection in Beijing
Chairman, fellow comrades:
    I agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the CPPCC Standing Committee. Attending the NPC as a non-voting delegate, I also listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on the draft of the 1960 national economic plan and on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, which made me feel extremely excited. I wholeheartedly and warmly support these two reports. We all know that in 1959, floods and droughts almost swept across the country. The country did encounter some difficulties in economic construction, but the difficulties could not stop our heroic steps forward. In 1959, we not only achieved great and brilliant results in all aspects of industrial and agricultural economic construction, and achieved a balance of revenue and expenditure in finance, but also had a surplus of 1.39 billion yuan. This is something that has never happened in Chinese history; it is also something that capitalist countries cannot do. The 1960 national economic plan presents an even more glorious and splendid prospect before us. We must realize this plan, and we will certainly be able to realize it. Because under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, it not only guaranteed the overfulfillment of the 1959 national economic plan, but also can guarantee that we will achieve even greater and more brilliant victories in 1960. Recently, I participated in an inspection in Beijing and visited many units such as the First Machine Tool Plant, Xuanwu Steel Plant, and Beijing Shoe Factory. During the inspection, I deeply realized the important role of the Party's leadership and the three red banners in the cause of building socialism. The establishment and production process of these factories, without exception, thoroughly implemented the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical under the leadership of the Party. For example, the First Machine Tool Plant, through mass movements and technological reforms, has automated the entire production process. Some departments also use radio remote control, reducing workers by one-third and increasing output by 20 to 80 times. The Xuanwu Steel Plant was originally a dilapidated small factory manufacturing briquette stoves. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it leaped into a steel plant. It did not ask the government for a penny. It completely relied on the masses to liberate their minds, dare to think and dare to act, and started from scratch. Now it is a modern steel plant with a fairly high output and a fairly large scale. The Beijing Shoe Factory was started from scratch by the street party committee mobilizing residents. Originally, it completely relied on hand-made shoes, with low output and high costs. Last year, under the brilliant light of the General Line, it fully mobilized the masses, relied on the collective wisdom of the workers, used waste materials, and reformed tools by themselves using old machines. Now it has achieved mechanized production. The output has increased from one pair of soles per person per day to eighty pairs per person per day. The wage cost has also been reduced from 45 cents per pair of soles to 5 cents. Of course, there are many examples, too numerous to mention. These three examples alone are enough to illustrate that the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three magic weapons for our high-speed construction of socialism and the only guarantee for the victory of all our work. Without these three magic weapons, we cannot build socialism, nor can we achieve a happy and beautiful communist society. This cannot help but move me deeply. China was originally a "poor and blank" country. What did the old China ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries leave us besides hunger and disaster? But in the ten years since the founding of the country, the face of the motherland has completely changed. All aspects of economic construction have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements, the people's living standards have also been universally improved, and the international status has also jumped from a semi-colonial country that was bullied by others to one of the world's largest and strongest countries. This is really something we never dreamed of in the past. Why has China undergone such earth-shaking changes in these short years? In a word, this is the result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the correct implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines in various tasks. From this, we can know that no matter what we do, we can only achieve victory and do things that conform to the interests of the people by relying on the leadership of the Party. Therefore, we must listen to the Party's words, be determined to follow the Party forever, and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, Chairman Mao's works, and the Party's policies and guidelines, thoroughly transform our thinking, establish a proletarian world outlook, and contribute all our strength to building socialism, so that individuals will have a bright and promising future. I am willing to encourage and supervise each other with my comrades. My words end here. If there is anything incorrect, I hope the comrades will give criticism and corrections.

### 三大法宝是取得胜利的可靠保证  刘定五委员谈在北京视察的感想

    三大法宝是取得胜利的可靠保证
    刘定五委员谈在北京视察的感想主席、各位同志：
    我同意陈叔通副主席政协常委会工作报告。列席人大又听了李富春、李先念两位副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告及关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，使我感到无比的兴奋。我衷心热烈地拥护这两个报告。我们都知道，1959年水旱灾害几乎遍及全国，国家在经济建设上并不是没有困难的，但困难挡不住我们英勇向前迈进的步伐。1959年我们不仅在工农业经济建设各方面都取得了伟大辉煌的成绩，财政上做到收支平衡，而且还结余十三亿九千万元。这是中国历史上从来没有过的事情；也是资本主义国家所办不到的事情。1960年的国民经济计划又把一幅更加光辉灿烂的美景展现在我们眼前。我们一定要实现这个计划，并且也一定能够实现。因为在党的正确领导下和总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，不仅保证了1959年国民经济计划的超额完成，而且可以保证我们在1960年取得更大更辉煌的胜利。最近我曾参加在北京的视察，看了第一机床厂、宣武钢铁厂、北京制鞋厂等许多单位，在视察当中，使我深深体会到党的领导和三面红旗在建设社会主义的事业中所起的重要作用。在这些工厂的建立和生产过程中，没有一个不是在党的领导下切实贯彻了多、快、好、省的精神的。例如第一机床厂，经过群众运动，进行技术改革，全部生产过程都已经自动化。有些部门还用无线电远距离操纵，工人比原来减少三分之一，产量比原来提高二十到八十倍。宣武钢铁厂原来是一个制造煤球炉子的破烂不堪的小工厂，在1958年大跃进中一跃而成为炼钢厂，没有向政府要一个钱，完全是依靠群众解放思想，敢想敢做，白手起家搞起来的，现在已经是一个产量相当高，规模相当大的现代化炼钢厂了。北京制鞋厂是街道党委发动居民白手起家搞起来的，原来完全靠手工做鞋，产量低，成本也高，去年在总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发动群众，依靠工人同志们的集体智慧，利用废料，旧机器自己动手改革工具，现在已经达到生产机械化，产量由原来的每人每天做一双鞋底，提高到每人每天做八十双，工资成本也由原来的四角五分钱一双鞋底，降低到五分钱。当然例子很多，是举不胜举的。仅就这三个事例就足以说明党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗是我们高速度建设社会主义的三大法宝，是我们一切工作取得胜利的唯一保证。没有这三个法宝就不能建设社会主义，同时也就不能达到幸福美好的共产主义社会。由此不禁使我深受感动。中国原是一个“一穷二白”的国家。国民党反动派统治的旧中国留给我们的除了饥饿和灾难以外，还有什么呢？但建国十年来，祖国的面貌完全改变了。经济建设各方面都获得了前所未有的辉煌成就，人民生活也有了普遍的提高，国际地位也由一个任人欺凌的半殖民地国家，跃居世界最大强国之列。这真是我们过去做梦也没有想到过的事情。为什么在这短短的几年内，中国会有这种翻天复地的转变呢？一句话，这是由于党和毛主席的英明领导，以及在各项工作中正确地贯彻执行了党的政策方针的结果。从这里我们可以知道，无论干什么，只有依靠党的领导，才能取得胜利，也才能做出符合人民利益的事情。因此我们必须听党的话，下决心永远跟着党走，并且认真学习马列主义、毛主席著作和党的政策方针，彻底改造思想，树立无产阶级的世界观，为建设社会主义贡献出自己的一切力量，个人才会有光明远大的前途。我愿与同志们共同勉励，互相督促。我的话到此为止，如有不正确的地方，希望同志们给予批评指正。
