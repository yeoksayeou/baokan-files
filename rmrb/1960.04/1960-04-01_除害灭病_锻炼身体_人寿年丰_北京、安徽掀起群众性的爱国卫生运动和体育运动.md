Xinhua News Agency, March 31st:

    Eliminate Pests and Diseases, Strengthen the Body, Longevity and Good Harvests
    Mass Patriotic Health Campaign and Sports Movement Sweeping Beijing and Anhui

    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 31st, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on March 21st. Based on central instructions, the meeting discussed Beijing's health work and decided to convene a conference on health and sports work. The Municipal Committee's health and sports work conference lasted three days and concluded on the 28th. This conference focused on summarizing the experiences of health and sports work over the past two years and determined the tasks and methods for further promoting the patriotic health campaign and mass sports movement on the basis of existing work. Nearly six hundred people attended the conference, including heads of Party organizations, health and sports work cadres from various districts (counties), suburban people's communes, factories, government agencies, schools, streets, and medical and sports units.

    The meeting pointed out while summarizing the experiences of persistently carrying out the patriotic health campaign over the past two years, the patriotic health campaign in the city centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, has been carried out on an unprecedented scale. The fundamental reason for the continuous leap forward in the patriotic health campaign over the past two years is that the Party committee attaches importance to it, the secretary takes the lead, the masses are fully mobilized, and competitions, evaluations, and inspections are carried out. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always regarded health work as a major event with important significance in changing customs and transforming the world, which is beneficial to production, work, study, and enhancing the physical fitness of the people in the capital. In the Great Leap Forward in production, the technical and cultural revolution, the people's commune movement, and urban transformation, attention has been paid to actively arranging health work. It was stipulated that a city-wide health blitz would be held once a month, and grand events would be held during festivals, repeatedly carried out, and become a habit. In each movement, according to the different seasons and different situations, action slogans and specific requirements for each battle were put forward in a high-profile manner to mobilize the masses to concentrate their efforts on a blitz, thereby achieving remarkable results, dealing with a large number of stagnant water pits, transforming more than 400,000 old-style toilets, clearing millions of tons of organic waste and feces, repeatedly eliminating the four pests, and greatly improving the sanitary conditions of the capital.

    The meeting believes that Beijing, while insisting on the patriotic health campaign over the past two years, has also started from a positive perspective and vigorously carried out mass sports activities, thereby strengthening the people's physique and playing a positive role in labor production.

    After summarizing the experiences of the health movement and sports work over the past two years, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to further comprehensively implement the Party's general line, adapt to the new situation, cooperate with the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, and do a good job in health and sports work to ensure the physical health of the people in the capital. The meeting believes that Beijing's patriotic health campaign must make greater achievements in the next three years, resolutely eliminate rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, as well as lice, fleas, etc., and systematically eliminate major diseases that seriously endanger people's health and seriously affect production. In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to continue to implement the principle of the secretary taking the lead, the whole Party mobilizing, everyone participating, eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating diseases. All propaganda tools must be mobilized, all health and medical personnel must be combined with the masses, and health propaganda and education must be further carried out to improve the public's health knowledge and enable the masses to develop healthy habits and establish a social atmosphere of "taking hygiene as an honor and unhygienic behavior as a disgrace" as soon as possible.

    The meeting made arrangements for health work in factories, mines, rural areas, government agencies, schools, etc., pointing out that Party committees of factories and mining enterprises should make comprehensive arrangements in conjunction with the production movement, and further improve environmental hygiene, food hygiene, and personal hygiene. Further improving rural health work is an important task at present. All cadres, especially the cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams, should also pay attention to health work while grasping production, further improve the patriotic health movement organizations at all levels of the commune, and better ensure that everyone is responsible at every level and actively carry out the work of eliminating pests and diseases. The health work of urban streets must be further promoted in conjunction with the new situation of organizing the people to participate in production and organizing the people's economic life. Doing a good job in the health work of public canteens and childcare institutions, ensuring clean and hygienic food, and ensuring the health of adults and children is a major event related to the better consolidation of these collective welfare undertakings and the liberation of women's labor force. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over these collective living units, improve the ideological awareness and health knowledge of staff, establish and improve health systems, and train staff in health knowledge, so that each unit has a certain number of health work backbones.

    The meeting pointed out that while carrying out a large-scale patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, it is also necessary to widely carry out mass sports activities. At present, spring physical exercises centered on radio exercises (pre-work exercises, recess exercises, production exercises) should be actively carried out, and the masses should be called upon to exercise if they can participate in sports activities. It is also necessary to combine production, work, and study, and carry out various activities in accordance with local conditions, and strengthen physical exercises for young people and national defense sports activities.

    The conference also discussed issues such as medical treatment, epidemic prevention, training medical cadres, vigorously conducting medical scientific research, strengthening the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and hospital management.

    The comrades attending the meeting unanimously expressed that, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, they will further implement the Party's policies and mobilize the city's seven million people to work together and make greater achievements in the health and sports front.

    This newspaper reported that various parts of Anhui Province are closely integrating with the spring production and are launching a nationwide patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene. In carrying out this movement, the broad masses of the people have been actively involved, fighting spirit high, resolutely not allowing the four pests of rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes to show their heads, and eliminating them wherever they are found.

    In mid-March, the Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions, required all localities to carry out pest and disease eradication work. Recently, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made specific arrangements for pest and disease eradication work at the provincial six-level cadre conference, requiring all localities to overcome various erroneous understandings, carry out large-scale propaganda and mobilization, create momentum, and immediately launch a large-scale movement to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene. Men, women, and children should be mobilized together to launch a major campaign against rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes. In the work of eliminating pests and diseases, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of health work serving production, so that the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene are closely integrated with production. To mobilize the masses, use their brains, continuously study and improve technology, and think of various ways to achieve small expenditures and large gains; combine the blitz movement with regular work, so that the upsurge of pest eradication and hygiene is constantly rising; to earnestly strengthen the guidance of the movement to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, the first secretaries of the Party committees must personally take command, and tighten at all levels, and implement it to the end.

    After the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the mobilization at the six-level cadre conference, all localities acted quickly and successively convened oath-taking meetings and broadcast meetings for eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. Now, throughout the province, from cities to villages, the broad masses of the people have invested in the vigorous patriotic health movement. More than 4,000 members of the Sihe People's Commune in Feixi County, Hefei area, combined with manure accumulation and cleaned up more than 1,000 sewage ditches and filled 2,000 water cellars in half a day. In the two days of March 20th and 21st, various people's communes in the Shu District launched a blitz to kill more than 20,000 rats and dig six catties of pupae.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, Anhui has further improved the leading institutions for eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. For example, the Fuyang Special District has strengthened and enhanced the Patriotic Health Movement Committees from the special district, county, commune, to the production brigade, with the first secretary of the Party committee and the secretary in charge of cultural and educational health serving as directors. Full-time cadres have also been deployed in pest and disease eradication offices at all levels. In addition to establishing a city pest and disease eradication headquarters, Hefei City also established pest and disease eradication sub-headquarters and large, medium, and small teams in accordance with regions, systems, and units, and established health systems to determine who would be responsible for the work from beginning to end.

    Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have always attached great importance to the work of eliminating pests and diseases. Since the spring of this year, Huainan City has organized more than 6.3 million people to participate in the pest and disease eradication movement. So far, the city has killed more than 1.7 million rats, eliminated more than 50 kilograms of mosquitoes, more than 12,000 kilograms of fly pupae, and cleared more than 1.2 million tons of garbage. Various localities have also organized a large number of medical personnel to go deep into rural areas and industrial and mining areas to carry out disease prevention and eradication work. Because early prevention, early detection, and early control methods have been adopted for diseases, some areas of the province have controlled the spread of diseases.

    In order to promote the in-depth development of the movement, the Anhui Provincial Pest Elimination Headquarters decided to immediately organize a major inspection and evaluation throughout the province. The first batch of inspection teams will go to various places in early April.

    除害灭病　锻炼身体　人寿年丰
    北京、安徽掀起群众性的爱国卫生运动和体育运动
    据新华社31日讯　中共北京市委3月21日举行常委扩大会议，根据中央指示讨论了北京市的卫生工作，并且决定召开卫生体育工作会议。市委卫生体育工作会议历时三天，已在28日结束。这个会议着重总结了两年来卫生体育工作的经验，并确定在已有的工作基础上，进一步大搞爱国卫生运动和大搞群众体育运动的任务和办法。参加会议的有各区（县）、郊区人民公社、工厂、机关、学校、街道和医疗体育单位的党组织负责人、卫生体育工作干部近六百人。
    会议在总结两年来坚持不懈地大搞爱国卫生运动的经验时指出，全市以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，有了空前规模的开展。党委重视，书记挂帅，充分发动群众，开展竞赛、评比、检查，是两年来爱国卫生运动实现持续跃进的根本原因。中共北京市委一直把卫生工作看成是具有移风易俗、改造世界的重要意义的大事，有利于生产、有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于增强首都人民体质的工作。在生产大跃进，技术和文化大革命，以及人民公社运动和城市改造等工作中都注意积极地安排卫生工作，并规定每月举行一次全市性的卫生大突击，逢年过节还要大搞，反复进行，成为习惯。在历次运动中，又根据不同的季节不同的情况，及时提出每个战役的行动口号和具体要求，大张旗鼓、大造声势，动员广大群众集中力量突击，从而取得了显著的成绩，处理了大批积水坑洼，改造了四十万多个旧式厕所，清除了上百万吨的有机垃圾和粪便，反复地扑除四害，在很大程度上改善了首都的卫生面貌。
    会议认为，北京市两年来在坚持爱国卫生运动的同时，还从积极方面着手，大搞群众性的体育运动，从而增强了人民体质，对劳动生产起了积极的作用。
    这次会议总结了两年来卫生运动和体育工作的经验后着重指出：必须进一步全面贯彻执行党的总路线、适应新的形势、配合工农业生产和各项建设事业的跃进，搞好卫生体育工作，以保证首都人民的身体健康。会议认为，北京市的爱国卫生运动一定要在今后三年内作出更大的成绩，坚决消灭老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子以及虱子、跳蚤等，有计划地消灭严重危害人民健康和严重影响生产的主要疾病。为了完成这个任务，要继续实行书记挂帅，全党动员，人人动手，大除四害，大讲卫生，大灭疾病。一切宣传工具都要动员起来，一切卫生医药人员都要与群众结合，进一步开展卫生宣传教育，提高群众的卫生知识，使广大群众尽快地养成卫生习惯，树立“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的社会风尚。
    会议对厂矿、农村、机关、学校等方面的卫生工作做了部署，指出厂矿企业党委应结合生产运动，作出全面安排，把环境卫生、饮食卫生、个人卫生都要进一步搞好。进一步搞好农村的卫生工作，是当前的一项重要任务。所有干部，特别是公社、大队和小队的干部，在抓生产的同时，也要抓卫生工作，进一步健全公社各级爱国卫生运动组织，更好地作到层层有人负责，积极开展除害灭病工作。城区街道的卫生工作，必须结合组织人民参加生产和组织人民经济生活的新形势，向前推进一步。搞好公共食堂和托儿机构的卫生工作，吃的干净卫生，保证大人和孩子的健康，这是关系这些集体福利事业更好的巩固，关系妇女劳动力的解放的一件大事。因此，各级党委都要加强对于这些集体生活单位的领导，提高工作人员的思想觉悟和卫生知识，建立和健全卫生制度，并对工作人员进行卫生知识的训练，使每个单位都有一定数目的卫生工作骨干分子。
    会议指出，在大规模开展除四害、讲卫生的爱国卫生运动的同时，还必须广泛展开群众性的体育活动。当前应积极开展以广播操（工前操、课间操、生产操）为中心的春季体育锻炼，号召群众，凡有可能参加体育活动的人都来锻炼。还必须结合生产、工作和学习，因人因时因地制宜，开展多种多样的活动，特别要加强青少年的体育锻炼和国防体育的活动。
    这次会议还讨论了医疗、防疫、培养医务干部、大搞医学科学研究、加强中西医团结、医院管理工作等问题。
    与会同志一致表示，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，进一步贯彻党的方针政策，动员全市七百万人民共同努力，一定会在卫生体育战线上做出更大的成绩。
    本报讯　安徽省各地正紧密结合春季大生产，掀起一个全民性的除四害讲卫生的爱国卫生运动。在开展这一运动中，广大群众人人动手，斗志昂扬，坚决不让老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子四害露头，发现在哪里就把它消灭在那里。
    3月中旬，省委即按照中央指示精神，要求各地展开除害灭病工作。最近，中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志在全省六级干部大会上，对除害灭病工作又作了具体布置，要求各地克服各种错误认识，大宣传，大动员，造成声势，立即开展一个大规模的除四害讲卫生运动，男女老幼要一起动员起来，向老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子来一个大进军。在除害灭病工作中，要坚决贯彻卫生工作为生产服务的方针，做到除四害讲卫生和生产紧密结合；对除害灭病工作要和搞生产一样，发动群众、开动脑筋，不断钻研和提高技术，想出各种办法，做到花力小，收效大；要把突击运动与经常工作结合起来，使除四害讲卫生的热潮，节节高涨；要切实加强对除四害讲卫生运动的指导，党委第一书记都要亲自挂帅，层层抓紧，贯彻始终。
    在省委指示和六级干部会上动员以后，各地行动迅速，相继召开了除四害讲卫生的誓师大会、广播大会。现在，全省从城市到农村，广大群众已投入轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动。合肥地区肥西县的四合人民公社四千多名社员，在半天内即结合积肥清理污水沟达一千多条，填水窖两千个。蜀山区各人民公社在3月20、21日两天内，突击灭鼠两万多只，挖蛹六斤。
    为加强对这一运动的领导，安徽各地都进一步健全了除四害讲卫生的领导机构。如阜阳专区从专区、县、公社到生产大队都充实和加强了爱国卫生运动委员会，由党委第一书记和分管文教卫生的书记任主任，各级除害灭病办公室也都调配了专职干部。合肥市除成立市除害灭病指挥部外，还按地区、系统、单位分别成立了除害灭病分指挥部和大队、中队、小队的组织，并建立了卫生制度，确定专人负责，一抓到底。
    安徽省各级党委对除害灭病工作一直很重视。淮南市今年春季以来，就组织了六百三十多万人次投入了除害灭病运动，到目前为止，这个市已灭鼠一百七十多万只，消灭蚊子五十多公斤，蝇蛹一万二千多公斤，清除垃圾一百二十多万吨。各地还组织了大批医务人员深入农村和工矿区开展防病灭病工作。由于对疾病采取了早预防、早发现、早控制的办法，全省有些地区已控制了疾病的传染。
    为了促进运动的深入发展，安徽省除四害指挥部决定立即在全省范围内组织大检查、大评比。第一批检查团将于4月初分赴各地。
