On Matching
Wu Lü

Concentrating dispersed advanced experiences and matching them into complete sets. This work is being done everywhere, and it is mostly being done quickly. It seems to be a relatively easy thing – since the unfolding of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, there have been no fewer than thousands of advanced experiences in all walks of life, so what is difficult about matching them into sets?

Indeed, the rich creations of the broad masses of people in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements have created important prerequisites for the work of matching advanced experiences. Without these myriad and dazzling advanced experiences, there would be no basis for talking about matching. However, this does not mean that with these many advanced experiences, matching is an easy task that can be taken lightly. The matching of advanced experiences, whether it is the matching between various processes within a work section, between various work sections within a workshop, or between various workshops within an enterprise, will inevitably lead to an imbalance. The advanced experience of one process increases production efficiency by 80%, while the advanced experience of another process may only increase production efficiency by 40%, and another process may even lack mature advanced experience, with production capacity remaining at the original level. How to deal with this imbalance, whether to balance towards the advanced level, the intermediate level, or the backward level, is an unavoidable ideological struggle in the work of matching advanced experiences.

Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory recently matched 721 sets of advanced experiences in four months, increasing the factory's production capacity by 51%. The speed of progress and the magnitude of the results are obvious. How was this achievement obtained? It seems that the main experience is to adhere to active balancing. In this factory, the degree of mechanization and automation in cold processing has increased rapidly, while forging, casting, transportation, and other links have fallen behind. Therefore, they vigorously carried out a technical revolution, equipped various advanced experiences, and caught up, moving from imbalance to a new balance. Then, inspection, design, and other links could not keep up, and the method was still to vigorously carry out a technical revolution and promote advanced experiences to make them adapt to the advanced level. If the idea of active balancing is lacking, then the situation will be completely different. Either it will not be possible to match complete sets at all, and the links lacking advanced experience will still lack advanced experience, and the advanced processes will be constrained by the front, back, left, and right, unable to exert their power, and eventually even a "reduction" phenomenon will occur; or although they are matched into complete sets, they are matched according to low standards, and the advanced is still subject to the backward, and the production capacity that could have been increased by 80% is only increased by 40%.

It can be seen that the matching process is a process of seeking advanced balance from imbalance. Therefore, the work of matching is not only an organizational and technical work, but first and foremost an ideological work. Whether advanced experiences can be matched into complete sets, whether it is a high-standard matching or a low-standard matching, depends on whether there is an idea of active balancing. Matching is also a regular work. Production always proceeds according to the dialectical law of balance – imbalance – new balance. The completion of matching reaches a new balance, and then a new imbalance will appear, requiring another matching. This is another ideological struggle between active balancing and passive balancing.

Ideological revolution is the precursor of technical revolution. The birth of thousands of technical revolution projects is permeated with ideological struggle from beginning to end. But the success of each technical revolution project does not mean the end of the ideological struggle. The promotion of advanced experiences is a new ideological struggle; the matching of advanced experiences is also a new ideological struggle. The banner of ideological revolution cannot be put away at any time or in any work.

    谈配套
    吴滤
    把分散的先进经验集中起来，配搭成套。这件工作，各地都在做，而且大都做得很快。看起来，似乎是一件比较容易的事情——技术革新和技术革命运动开展以来，各行各业的先进经验何止万千，配之成套，有何难哉？
    确实，广大人民群众在技术革新和技术革命运动中的丰富的创造，已经为先进经验的配套工作创造了重要的前提。若没有这些万紫千红、琳琅满目的先进经验，配套二字就无从谈起。然而，这并不等于说，有了这许许多多的先进经验，配套就是一件轻而易举的事情，可以等闲视之了。先进经验的配套，不论是一个工段内部各个工序之间的配套，不论是一个车间内部各个工段之间的配套，或者是一个企业内部各个车间之间的配套，都必然会出现不平衡的情况。这一道工序的先进经验把生产效率提高了80％，那一道工序的先进经验却可能只把生产效率提高了40％，另一道工序甚至还缺乏成熟的先进经验，生产能力仍然停留在原有的水平上。怎样对待这种不平衡的状态，是向先进的水平平衡，还是向中间的水平平衡，还是向落后的水平平衡，是先进经验配套工作中一场不可避免的思想斗争。
    重庆建设机床厂最近四个月配成了七百二十一套先进经验，使全厂生产能力提高了51％，进展之快，收效之大，是显然的。这成绩是如何得来的呢？看来，主要一条经验就是坚持积极平衡。在这个厂里，冷加工方面的机械化、自动化程度提高得很快，锻造、铸造、运输等环节落在后面。于是就大闹技术革命，配备各种先进经验，赶了上来，由不平衡走向新的平衡。接着，检验、设计等环节跟不上了，办法还是大闹技术革命，推广先进经验，使之与先进的水平相适应。如果缺乏积极平衡的思想，那么情况就会完全不同了。或则根本配不成套，缺乏先进经验的环节还是缺乏先进经验，先进的工序受到前后左右的牵制，不能展施威力，最后甚至发生“还原”的现象；或则虽然配搭成套，但是是按照低标准配套的，仍然是先进的受制于落后的，生产能力本来可以提高80％只提高了40％。
    可见，配套的过程，是一个从不平衡中求得先进的平衡的过程。因而配套的工作，不只是一件组织工作和技术工作，而首先是一件思想工作。能不能把先进经验配搭成套，是高标准的配套还是低标准的配套，都取决于有没有积极平衡的思想。配套又是一件经常工作。生产总是循着平衡——不平衡——新的平衡的辩证规律进行的。配套的完成，达到了新的平衡，接着又会出现新的不平衡，需要进行再一次配套。这又是一场积极平衡和消极平衡的思想斗争。
    思想革命是技术革命的先驱。千千万万件技术革命项目的诞生，都贯穿着自始至终的思想斗争。但是每一件技术革命项目的成功，都不意味着思想斗争的结束。先进经验的推广，是一场新的思想斗争；先进经验的配套，也是一场新的思想斗争。思想革命的旗帜，在任何时候，任何工作中，都是不能收起来的。
