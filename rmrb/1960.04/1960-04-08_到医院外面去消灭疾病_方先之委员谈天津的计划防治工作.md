Eliminating Diseases Outside the Hospital
Committee Member Fang Xianzhi Discusses Tianjin's Planned Prevention and Treatment Work

Through planned prevention and treatment, the weak links and key problems in the sanitation of Tianjin's streets, districts, and factories have been basically identified, as well as the incidence rates of common diseases, chronic diseases, occupational diseases, and industrial injuries. Tens of thousands of Red Cross health workers and first-aid personnel have also been trained. Workers' attendance rates have significantly improved, and the number of outpatient visits to general comprehensive hospitals has shown a downward trend, allowing doctors to devote more time to scientific research.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 Draft National Budget," and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. I also agree with and endorse Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

From the reports of the two vice premiers, we can see that China's 1960 national economic plan and national budget are plans and budgets that grow larger year by year, continuing the Great Leap Forward. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 and the completion of the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the year 1960 began with an unprecedented new atmosphere of "a red start and red every month," and with the support of the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to resolutely "remain red to the end," we believe that the economic construction tasks of 1960 will certainly be victoriously completed and overfulfilled, making a good start for continued leaps forward within the sixties, surpassing Britain, and catching up with the world level. In the near future, we will all be able to see with our own eyes our motherland being built into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture, education, science and technology appearing in the world. Chairman Mao led us to defeat feudalism, imperialism, and reactionary rule; he is also correctly leading us to build socialism. The Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our country over the past two years has once again proved the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. It has also demonstrated the unparalleled powerful vitality and superiority of the people's communes.

In China's entire budget for 1960, military expenditure accounts for only 8.3%, while the United States' military expenditure for 1960-1961 is equivalent to 57.1% of the national budget. From this, we can clearly see who is disrupting peace and preparing for war. We must remain vigilant and must not be deceived by the hypocritical peace posture of U.S. imperialism. In general, China's national economic plan for 1960 is an inspiring and magnificent plan, a plan for peaceful construction.

Now, in connection with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the plan for health undertakings—that is, to continue to vigorously carry out the mass movement of eliminating pests and diseases and emphasizing hygiene, to fully mobilize the masses, make a big fanfare, and conduct extensive publicity so that everyone knows and everyone acts; and to combine the hygiene movement with the Great Leap Forward in production and the cultural and technological revolution; and to strengthen medical prevention work with hospitals as the center, I would like to report to you, fellow committee members, how medical workers in Tianjin are listening to the Party, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively serving, strengthening transformation, and implementing the general line of socialist construction and the health policy of giving priority to prevention in health undertakings.

When the Party put forward the general line of socialist construction and strengthening the study of traditional Chinese medicine by Western medicine in 1958, many medical workers, especially those who were older, had varying degrees of resistance in their thinking. After the Party's patient education, study, visits, and practice, most people had a preliminary understanding in theory and understood the importance and necessity of developing medical and health undertakings at high speed. However, it was not very clear to everyone how to implement the Party's policies in specific work. The Party pointed out the direction and path in a timely manner and mobilized the masses. As a result, medical workers in Tianjin, under the leadership and support of the Party, took the lead in advocating the implementation of a 24-hour outpatient service and a three-shift outpatient service, as well as the establishment of simple hospital beds throughout the country. These measures greatly facilitated patients, encouraged workers, promoted production, and solved the long-standing contradiction between hospitals and patients, such as long waiting times for consultations and beds. Without increasing manpower or funding, the number of medical beds in Tianjin has greatly increased (including regular and simple beds). In most hospitals, the number of outpatient visits has increased by more than 50%, and the number of surgeries has increased by 30% to 40%. This fully proves the correctness of the Party's policies. At the same time, it also shows the high enthusiasm and soaring drive of medical cadres in Tianjin, which has pushed medical work a big step forward and made a good start for implementing the Party's general line in health undertakings, achieving more and faster results. After a period of practice, the Party timely proposed that while working hard and practically, we should also work cleverly. The Party helped us mobilize the masses, including hospitalized patients, to engage in scientific research and mass technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale. For example, the system of co-management of wards by workers and patients and the system of combining medicine, education, and nursing in pediatric wards have completely changed the old appearance of the wards; improved the accuracy of diagnosis, accelerated the speed of diagnosis, reduced the number of revisits by patients, and stopped the development of diseases; and improved surgical techniques, which can reduce the number of surgeries to treat difficult diseases. For example, spinal tuberculosis used to require three surgeries to be cured, but now it can be cured with one surgery. Therefore, the patient's pain is reduced, the treatment process is shortened, and medical costs are reduced. Through the study of traditional Chinese medicine by Western medicine, many wonderful and colorful flowers have been discovered from the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine. Lumbar disc herniation, which is relatively common among working people and seriously affects production, has always been treated with Western surgical methods in our country; since the application of massage, which combines traditional Chinese and Western medicine, 60% of patients can be cured without surgery. This not only avoids the dangers and pain of surgery, but also saves costs and hospital beds. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of fractures has achieved even greater success. The fracture treatment methods used by traditional Chinese orthopedic departments are very good methods, and the results obtained are: no joint stiffness, no muscle atrophy, rapid fracture healing, and rapid recovery of limb function, with an average course of treatment shortened by one-third. In short, because we can listen well to the Party, on the basis of more and faster results in the previous stage, through mass technological innovation and revolution, diligently study traditional Chinese medicine, and actively use the method of walking on two legs, we have advanced medical and health undertakings in both quality and quantity. However, it must be pointed out that although we have taken some positive measures and recognize that these measures are very important and should continue to be carried out in the future, we have not been able to break out of the old framework of "hospitals only carry out treatment, and medical workers passively wait for patients inside the hospital gates," and have not fundamentally changed and improved the nature of hospital work. In order to thoroughly implement the health policy of giving priority to prevention, the Party in Tianjin put forward the "planned prevention and treatment work centered on hospitals" in January of this year. It is expected that within three to five years, twenty-two acute infectious diseases, common diseases, chronic diseases, occupational diseases, and industrial injuries that are most harmful to people's health and have the greatest impact on production will be eliminated, controlled, or managed. According to this plan, it is required that medical workers in every medical unit in the city, including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel, go out of the hospital, go to the districts, factories, and people's communes, to find patients, to eliminate diseases, to mobilize the masses to carry out hygiene campaigns, to carry out hygiene publicity, and to train Red Cross medical staff and first-aid personnel in districts and workshops. This will ensure timely medical treatment, no loopholes in prevention, and everyone paying attention to hygiene. This call was warmly responded to by all medical workers in Tianjin, and planned prevention and treatment work has been widely carried out in Tianjin. In just over a month, under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau, and under the close cooperation, guidance and support of the hospital, district, and factory Party committees, planned prevention and treatment has basically identified the weak links and key problems in the sanitation of Tianjin's streets, districts, and factories. It has also identified the incidence rates of common diseases, chronic diseases, occupational diseases, and industrial injuries. Tens of thousands of Red Cross health workers and first-aid personnel have been trained in districts and factories, as well as among hospitalized patients in hospitals. Treatment and prevention work has begun in many places, the production attendance rate in factories has significantly improved, and the number of outpatient visits to general comprehensive hospitals has shown a downward trend, allowing doctors to devote time to more scientific research work. For example, workers in a certain mast lamp factory in Tianjin often went to a certain hospital for treatment due to finger injuries. In the past, the hospital held the attitude of "the hospital only provides treatment," and as a result, finger injuries did not decrease but increased. After the doctor went to the factory, he found that among the 113 workers in the factory, 112 had suffered finger injuries due to outdated tools and failure to follow operating procedures. Later, after the doctor, the factory Party committee, and the workers discussed together, the tools were improved, and operating procedures were emphasized, and finger injuries in the factory were completely eliminated. Similarly, workers in another chemical factory had a relatively high incidence of liver disease. The doctors in the hospital found that the patients had enlarged livers, poor liver function, poor appetite, and were weak all over, so they were treated for hepatitis. As a result, the old diseases were not cured, and new ones continued to appear. Only after the doctor went to the factory did he discover that the liver disease was caused by benzene poisoning, not general infectious hepatitis. After installing safety equipment and improving operating procedures, liver disease disappeared from the factory.

Through the short-term specific practice and demonstration in Tianjin, our medical workers have realized that the planned prevention and treatment work centered on hospitals is a further specific implementation of the Party's general line in health undertakings; it is the fundamental method of developing health undertakings with greater, faster, better, and more economical results by giving priority to prevention, combining prevention and treatment, following the mass line, carrying out mass movements, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and walking on two legs. Looking back, the idea of "carrying out medical prevention work centered on hospitals" was put forward by the Party as early as a few years ago. However, due to the bourgeois ideology of most doctors at that time, they believed that hospitals were treatment institutions, and carrying out prevention would affect treatment; some believed that prevention work was the business of public health doctors and had nothing to do with them; some believed that it was a waste of talent and not worth the effort for doctors from large hospitals to go to districts and factories; some believed that I was an orthopedic expert or a tumor expert, and I could not prevent dysentery or uterine prolapse; this was not possible, that was not possible, in short, they did not want to do it. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, after the Party's patient education, especially through the study of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, right-leaning sentiments have been reversed, enthusiasm has been boosted, and the thinking of the vast majority of medical cadres has been clarified, and they have understood that hospital work must be closely integrated with production. Going deep into the streets and factories, mobilizing the masses, carrying out mass hygiene campaigns on a large scale, conducting extensive hygiene publicity, and vigorously training grassroots health cadres to carry out prevention work can effectively reduce and control the incidence of diseases.

The above facts fully demonstrate that to do a good job in health undertakings, we must first put politics in command. Only by resolutely accepting the absolute leadership of the Party and listening to the Party will we have the correct direction and will we achieve great success. Through planned prevention and treatment, not only has the old set of health undertakings in Tianjin been fundamentally changed, but also the vast number of medical cadres have received profound socialist education, enabling them to have closer contact with the working people, and enabling them to further understand the selfless and noble qualities of the workers. At the same time, the working people feel the kindness of medical cadres in the Mao Zedong era. In the past, doctors who could not be found in hospitals are now coming to the districts and factories to find them. Our medical cadres in Tianjin are still very unfamiliar with carrying out planned prevention and treatment work universally, and there are still many shortcomings that need to be overcome, but we believe that under the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to successfully complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party.

Please correct any inappropriateness in the above statement, fellow committee members.

    到医院外面去消灭疾病
    方先之委员谈天津的计划防治工作
    通过计划防治，基本上摸清了天津市街道、地段、工厂中卫生状况的薄弱环节和关键问题，也摸清了多发病、慢性病、职业病以及工业损伤等病的发病率，并培养了成千上万红十字卫生员和急救员。工人出勤率有了显著提高，一般综合性医院门诊量有下降趋势，医生可腾出更多时间进行科学研究。主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，并保证在工作岗位上坚决贯彻。我也同意并拥护陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    从两位副总理的报告中可以看到，我国1960年的国民经济计划和国家预算，是一个规模一年比一年宏大，继续大跃进的计划和预算。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在1958年和1959年的大跃进以及第二个五年计划的指标已提前三年完成的基础上，1960年一开始即出现空前没有过的“开门红，月月红”的新气象，以及在全国人民要坚决“红到底”的冲天干劲的支持下，我们相信1960年的经济建设任务，一定能胜利完成和超额完成，为六十年代内继续不断地跃进，超过英国，赶上世界水平，做出良好的开端。在不久的日子里我们都可以亲眼看到我们祖国将建成为一个工业现代化、农业现代化、文教科学技术现代化的社会主义强国出现在世界上。毛主席领导我们战胜了封建主义、帝国主义和反动统治；他又在正确地领导我们建设社会主义。过去二年来我国社会主义建设大跃进，又一次证明了毛泽东思想的伟大和正确。并也显示了人民公社的无比强大的生命力和优越性。
    在1960年我国整个预算中军备经费只占8.3％，而美国1960—1961年度的军备经费则相当于国家预算的57.1％，从这里很清楚地就可以看到究竟谁在那里破坏和平，准备战争。我们必须保持警惕，切不可被美帝国主义的口是心非的假和平姿态所欺骗。总的说，我国1960年的国民经济计划是一个令人欢欣鼓舞规模宏伟的计划，是一个和平大建设的计划。
    现在结合李富春副总理报告中有关卫生事业计划——即继续大力开展除害灭病，讲卫生的群众性运动。做到充分发动群众，大张旗鼓，大作宣传，使家喻户晓，人人动作起来。并且使卫生运动与生产大跃进和文化、技术革命相结合。并要以医院为中心加强医疗预防工作等方面，我准备在这里向各位委员汇报一下，天津市的医务工作者怎样听党的话，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，积极服务，加强改造，在卫生事业中贯彻社会主义建设总路线和以预防为主的卫生方针。
    当1958年党提出社会主义建设总路线和加强西医学习中医的时候，有不少医务工作者，尤其是年岁比较大的，在思想上有不同程度的抵触。经过党的耐心教育，学习，参观和实践，多数人在理论上有了初步认识，明白了高速度发展医疗卫生事业的重要性和必要性。但在具体工作中究竟应该怎样贯彻党的方针政策，大家还不很清楚。党及时地指出了方向和道路，发动了群众。于是天津市的医务工作者，在党的领导和支持下，在全国范围内首先倡议实行二十四小时门诊制和三班门诊制以及设立简易病床。这些措施大大地便利了病人，鼓舞了工人，促进了生产，解决了长时间不能解决的医院与病人之间长时间候诊，候床等的矛盾。在不增加人力，和经费的情况下，天津市的医疗床位大为增加（包括正规和简易病床），在多数的医院中门诊人次数增加了50％以上，手术次数增加了30％至40％。这充分证明了党的政策的正确性。同时也说明天津市医务干部劳动热情的高涨和冲天的干劲，把医疗工作向前推进了一大步，为在卫生事业中贯彻党的总路线做了一个良好的开端，做到了多和快。经过一段时间的实践，党又适逢其时地提出了，在苦干实干的同时，还应该巧干。党帮助我们发动群众，包括住院的病人在内，大搞科学研究，大搞群众性的技术革新，技术革命。譬如工休合作管理病房制度，儿科病房医教并举制度，彻底地改变了病房气象的旧面貌；提高诊断的正确率，加快诊断的速度，减少了病人复诊的次数，制止了疾病的发展；改进手术技术操作，可以减少治疗疑难疾病的手术次数。例如脊椎结核过去一般需要进行三次手术才能治愈，现在可用一次手术治愈。因此减少了病人的痛苦，缩短了治疗过程，降低了医疗费用。通过西医学习中医，从祖国医学宝库中发掘出来了很多奇彩异花。劳动人民中比较常见而严重影响生产的腰椎间盘脱出症，在我国一向是采用西医外科手术处理的；自从应用中西医相结合的推拿术后，60％的病人可以不用手术获得治愈。不但避免了手术的危险和痛苦，而且节省了费用和医院里的床位。采用中西医相结合治疗骨折，有更大的成就。祖国正骨科所采用的骨折治疗的方法，是很好的方法，所获的结果是：关节不强直，肌肉不萎缩，骨折愈合快，患肢功能恢复迅速，平均疗程可以缩短三分之一。总之，因为能够好好地听党的话，在前一段多、快的基础上，通过群众性技术革新和革命，努力学习中医，积极地运用两条腿走路的方法，我们把医疗卫生事业，在质上和量上，又向前推进了一步。但必须指出，我们虽然采取了一些积极的措施，而且也认识到这些措施是很重要，而且今后应该继续努力进行的，可是我们还没有能够跳出“医院只进行治疗，医务工作者消极地在医院大门内等候病人”的旧框框，没有从根本上改变和改进医院的工作性质。为了彻底贯彻以预防为主的卫生事业方针，天津市今年1月间，党又及时地提出了“以医院为中心的计划防治工作”。预计要在三五年内消灭，控制或管理二十二种为害人民健康最大，影响生产最重的急性传染病，多发病，慢性病，职业病，工业损伤等。根据这个计划，要求全市每一个医疗单位的医务工作者包括医生、护士、行政人员，走出医院大门，下地段，下工厂，下人民公社，去寻找病人，去消灭疾病，去发动群众搞卫生运动，搞卫生宣传以及培训地段，车间红十字医士和卫生急救员。做到医疗及时，预防无漏洞，人人讲卫生。这个号召获得天津市全体医务工作者的热烈响应，计划防治工作已在天津普遍开花，轰轰烈烈地展开了。在短短的一个多月中，在天津市卫生局的统一领导下，在医院、地段、工厂党委密切合作地指导和支持下，通过计划防治，已基本摸清了天津市街道、地段、工厂中卫生状况的薄弱环节和关键问题。也摸清了多发病、慢性病、职业病以及工业损伤等病的发病率。在地段和工厂中以及在医院内住院的病人中，培训了成千上万的红十字卫生员和急救员。很多地方已开始进行治疗和预防工作，工厂中的生产出勤率有了显著的提高，一般综合性医院的门诊量有下降的趋势，医生可以腾出时间来搞更多的科学研究工作。例如天津市某一桅灯制造厂的工人，常因手指受伤到某一医院去治疗。过去医院抱着“医院只治疗”的态度，结果是手指受伤不见减少反而增加。大夫下厂后发现该厂的一百一十三名工人中，由于工具落后，工作不按操作规程，一百一十二名工人的手指受过伤。后来经过大夫与该厂党委和工人共同商量，改进了工具，强调了操作规程，该厂的手指伤完全消灭了。又像另一个化学工厂的工人中，肝病比较多。医院里的大夫发现病人肝肿大，肝功能不好，病人食欲不振，全身无力，就按肝炎治疗，结果旧病的治不好。新的继续出现。大夫下厂后才发现肝病是由苯中毒引起，不是一般的传染性肝炎，经过装置安全设备，改进操作规程，肝病在该厂中就此绝迹了。
    通过天津市短时间的具体实践和示范，使我们医务工作者认识到，以医院为中心的计划防治工作，是党的总路线在卫生事业中进一步的具体贯彻；是以预防为主，防治并举，通过群众路线，群众运动，土洋结合，两条腿走路的多快好省发展卫生事业的根本办法。回忆一下：“以医院为中心开展医疗预防工作”，早在几年前党已经提出过。但由于当时的多数医生的资产阶级思想作祟，认为医院是治疗机构，搞预防就要影响治疗；有的认为预防工作是公共卫生医生的事和我无关；有的认为大医院大大夫下地段工厂，是大才小用，得不偿失；有的认为我是骨科专家、瘤科专家，叫我预防痢疾，子宫脱垂搞不了；这个不行，那个不行，总之不想搞。1958年大跃进以来，经过党的耐心教育，尤其通过最近八届八中全会决议的学习以后，反掉了右倾情绪，鼓足了干劲，极大多数医务干部的思想搞通了，懂得了医院工作，必须紧密与生产相结合。深入街道、工厂、发动群众，大搞群众性卫生运动，大做卫生宣传，大力培训基层卫生干部开展预防工作，才能有效地降低和控制发病率。
    上述事实充分说明，要搞好卫生事业，首先必须政治挂帅，只有坚决接受党的绝对领导，听党的话，才会有正确的方向，才会有巨大的成就。通过计划防治，不但从根本上改变了天津市卫生事业旧的一套，而且使广大医务干部受到深刻的社会主义教育，使他们与劳动人民有更密切的接触，使他们更进一步懂得工人的大公无私的高贵品质。同时劳动人民感到毛泽东时代的医务干部的可亲。过去到医院里都找不到的大夫，现在下地段下工厂来找他们了。我们天津市的医务干部，对普遍进行计划防治工作还很生疏，还有许多缺点需要克服，但相信在党的领导下，我们一定能够胜利完成党交给我们的光荣任务。
    以上发言是否有当，请各位委员指正。
