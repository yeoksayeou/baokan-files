Major Demonstrations Erupt in Two Turkish Cities
Over Ten Thousand Students Shout Slogans Demanding the Dictator Menderes Step Down
Authorities Dispatch Military Police to Suppress the Masses, Dozens Killed and Wounded
Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Istanbul dispatch: On April 28th, approximately ten thousand students in Istanbul, an important city in western Turkey, erupted in a major demonstration against the government. They opposed the government's order to ban political activities for three months. The students shouted slogans demanding freedom, condemning Menderes as a dictator, and demanding Menderes's resignation. They also supported the South Korean people's struggle against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. The demonstration persisted for the entire day.

According to reports, the Menderes government dispatched twenty tanks and troops who had participated in the war of aggression against Korea to suppress the demonstration. Police opened fire on the students and launched tear gas. Initial reports indicate that at least four students were killed and seventeen were seriously injured.

The Menderes government declared martial law yesterday afternoon, prohibiting all gatherings and banning newspapers from publishing reports and photographs related to the demonstrations.

The demonstration erupted after the Turkish parliament passed a bill on the evening of the 27th amidst heated debate, which stipulated expanding the powers of a parliamentary committee investigating the opposition Republican People's Party. The ruling Democratic Party accused the opposition party of engaging in "destructive and illegal activities." This bill prohibits parties from holding any meetings or gatherings, prohibits the organization of new organizations between parties, and prohibits the publication of all news, articles, statements, communiqués, pictures, and documents related to the parliament's investigation.

An Associated Press dispatch from Istanbul on the 28th stated: "The situation in Turkey bears several similarities to that in (South) Korea." It pointed out that the U.S. government has provided both the Menderes government and the Syngman Rhee clique with hundreds of millions of dollars in "military and economic aid" to support them.

Prior to this, "The New York Times" had published an editorial on the 25th expressing concern that Turkey might also experience a South Korean situation. It said: "The Turkish government's practice of prohibiting normal political activities has aroused serious concerns in the hearts of Turkey's friends." It said: "The riots in South Korea are still fresh in their minds, making it impossible for them not to equate the two situations."

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Ankara dispatch: Following yesterday's major demonstration by ten thousand students in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, approximately four thousand students in Ankara, the Turkish capital, also held a demonstration against the Menderes government this morning. Ankara students expressed their support for the struggle of the Istanbul students and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Menderes.

At the same time, students in Istanbul held another demonstration today.

Students from the Faculty of Political Science and the Faculty of Law at Ankara University disregarded the authorities' martial law and held a demonstration on campus grounds, mourning the students killed in Istanbul and demanding that the Menderes government "account" for the killing of the Istanbul students yesterday. Professors from Ankara University also participated in the demonstration.

The demonstrating students sang the "Independence Song" and left the campus, preparing to march on the streets. The Menderes government dispatched cavalry and police to suppress them. The cavalry charged into the marching ranks and blockaded Ankara University. Police opened fire on the students and beat them with batons. News reports indicate that one student was killed and five were injured. Western news agencies reported that at least eight ambulances had entered Ankara University to transport injured students.

In Istanbul today, approximately six hundred students from the Technical University gathered in a square in the city to demonstrate, expressing support for the students who demonstrated yesterday. The demonstration marched to the front of the governor's residence. Police used tear gas to suppress the students. According to Western news agencies, the result of the military police suppression of the Istanbul students yesterday was at least fourteen student deaths.

    哪里有美国支持的反动统治哪里就有人民的斗争怒火
    土耳其两大城市爆发大示威
    万余学生高呼口号要独裁者曼德列斯下台
    当局出动军警开枪镇压群众死伤数十人
    新华社29日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其西部重要城市伊斯坦布尔28日爆发了约一万学生反对政府的大示威。他们反对政府禁止政治活动三个月的命令。学生们高呼要求自由、谴责曼德列斯为独裁者、要求曼德列斯辞职等口号。他们还支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的斗争。示威坚持了一整天。
    据报道，曼德列斯政府出动了二十辆坦克和曾经参加侵朝战争的军队镇压。警察向学生开枪和发射催泪弹。据初步报道，至少有四个学生被打死，十七个受重伤。
    曼德列斯政府在昨天下午宣布戒严，禁止一切集会，禁止报纸刊载有关示威的报道和照片。
    示威是在土耳其议会27日晚上在激烈争辩中通过一个法案之后爆发的，这个法案规定扩大一个调查反对党共和人民党的议会委员会的权力。执政党民主党指责反对党从事“破坏性的、非法的活动”。这个法案禁止党派举行任何会议和集会，禁止组织各党之间的新组织，并禁止发表有关议会进行这项调查的一切新闻、文章、声明、公报、图片和文件。
    美联社28日从伊斯坦布尔发出的一条消息说：“（土耳其的）情况和（南）朝鲜有若干相似的地方。”它指出，美国政府各给曼德列斯政府和李承晚集团上亿美元的“军事和经济援助”来支持他们。
    在这以前，“纽约时报”曾经在25日发表社论表示担心土耳其也出现南朝鲜的局面。它说：“土耳其政府禁止进行正常政治活动的作法在土耳其的朋友们的心中引起了严重的担心”。它说：“南朝鲜的暴动在他们脑海中记忆犹新，使得他们无法不把这两个情况等同起来。”
    新华社29日讯　安卡拉消息：继土耳其最大城市伊斯坦布尔昨天爆发一万学生大示威之后，今天上午土耳其首都安卡拉也有约四千名学生举行反对曼德列斯政府的示威。安卡拉学生表示支持伊斯坦布尔学生的斗争，要求总理曼德列斯辞职。
    同时，伊斯坦布尔的学生今天又举行了示威游行。
    安卡拉大学政治科学院和法学院的学生今天不顾当局的戒严令，在校内场地上举行了示威，为伊斯坦布尔死难学生默哀，并要求曼德列斯政府“交代”昨天杀害伊斯坦布尔学生的情况。安卡拉大学的教授也参加了示威。
    示威学生高唱着“独立歌”，走出校门准备上街游行。曼德列斯政府出动了骑兵部队和警察去镇压。骑兵冲进游行队伍并封锁了安卡拉大学。警察向学生开枪并用警棍殴打学生。有消息说，结果有一名学生被打死，五名被打伤。另据西方通讯社报道，最少曾经有八辆救护车开进安卡拉大学去载运受伤学生。
    伊斯坦布尔今天共有约六百名技术大学学生在市内一个广场上集会示威，表示支持昨天示威的学生。示威队伍曾经到省长官邸前面示威。警察曾经向学生发射催泪弹镇压。据西方通讯社报道，昨天军警镇压伊斯坦布尔学生的结果，至少有十四名学生死亡。
