Rosin Production Technology Undergoes Major Innovation
Fujian Promotes Chemical Resin Tapping Experience, Rosin Production Surges

Fuzhou, April 6th (report from our newspaper) Workers in rosin-producing areas of Fujian Province, focusing on the promotion of chemical resin tapping experience from Chong'an County, have been vigorously engaging in technological innovation and revolution, leading to a leap in rosin production. From January to the first half of March this year, the province's rosin output increased by more than two times compared to the same period last year.

Rosin production is a seasonal undertaking. Every year, as the weather turns cold, the flow of sap in pine trees slows down, resin ducts easily become blocked, and resin cannot flow out. Resin tappers often "go up the mountain during Qingming and come down after Frost's Descent." This not only leads to high mobility of resin tapping workers and an inability to fix the labor force but, more importantly, prevents the high-speed development of rosin production. Last year, between August and September, the CCP Chong'an County Committee, in order to break through the limitations of climate and seize high rosin yields, put forward the slogan "Chemicalization of resin tapping, specialization of labor, and perennialization of production," calling on resin tapping workers to liberate their thinking, break superstitions, and vigorously engage in a technological innovation movement centered on chemical resin tapping. Through the joint efforts of cadres and workers, a simple chemical resin tapping method was successfully tested. They used grass ash water, bitter bamboo ash water, or tung shell ash water, and other alkaline raw materials, mixed with turpentine to form a mixed agent, and applied it to pine tree resin ducts, preventing the ducts from solidifying quickly. This greatly increased rosin production and transformed resin tapping from seasonal to year-round production, opening up broad avenues for the basalization and perennialization of resin tapping. The Chong'an Chemical Factory used chemical resin tapping methods in the fourth quarter of last year, and its resin production increased two times compared to the same period in 1958. After the weather warmed up this spring, the average daily resin production per pine tree using chemical resin tapping increased by nearly one time compared to the winter.

After the promotion of chemical resin tapping in Nanping, Changting, Jian'ou, and other places, resin production has generally increased. Over five thousand resin tapping workers in Nanping Prefecture, after universally promoting the new chemical resin tapping methods created by resin tapping workers in Chong'an County, have rapidly increased resin tapping from a previous average of over ten jin per person per day to around forty jin. The resin yield per pine tree has increased from an average of one or two liang to over three or four liang, thus ensuring that rosin production in the entire prefecture is not weak during the off-season, with an increase of four times compared to the same period last year. After comprehensively improving resin tapping and rosin refining technologies, Minhou, Jinjiang, and other prefectures have all overfulfilled their rosin production plans for the first quarter. After relying on the staff to carry out technological innovation, Changting Rosin Factory improved a number of key production processes, achieving chemicalization of resin tapping, transportation of resin entirely by vehicles and boats, rosin refining and material delivery relying on gravity flow, and oil flow using bamboo pipes. This eliminated heavy manual labor and increased the factory's rosin output by six times compared to the same period last year, while also saving three hundred thousand labor days and seventy thousand yuan in funds.

In order to develop rosin production at a high speed, all localities have strengthened specific leadership over rosin production. Nanping, Jian'ou, Youxi, and other resin-producing areas have established chemical resin tapping command posts or experimental groups to promote the experience of chemical resin tapping. People's communes in all resin-producing areas have also organized specialized chemical resin tapping teams, which, under the unified leadership of the county party committees, are fully implementing the "four fixes" (fixing people, fixing tasks, fixing remuneration, and fixing rewards) and "four guarantees" (guaranteeing tapping, guaranteeing transportation, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing quantity), actively improving business management, and striving for a bumper harvest in rosin production this year.

    松香生产技术大革新
    福建推广化学采脂经验  松香产量激增
    本报福州6日电　福建各松香产区职工以推广崇安县化学采脂经验为中心，大搞技术革新和技术革命，促使松香产量飞跃上升。今年1月到3月上半月，全省松香产量比去年同期增长了两倍以上。
    松脂生产是季节性的生产。每年天气转冷，松树树液流动缓慢，脂沟容易闭塞，流不出脂，采脂工人常常是“清明上山，霜降下山”。这样不但采脂工人流动性大，劳力无法固定，更重要的是不能高速度发展松香生产。去年8、9月间，中共崇安县委为了突破气候的限制，夺取松香高产，提出“采脂化学化、劳力专业化、生产常年化”的口号，号召采脂工人解放思想，破除迷信，大搞以化学采脂为中心的技术革新运动。经过干部、工人的共同努力，试验成功简易的化学采脂方法。他们用草木灰水、苦竹灰水或桐壳灰水等含碱的原料，分别同松节油配成混合药剂，涂松树脂沟，使脂沟不会很快凝固。这样便大大提高了松香产量，并使采脂由季节性生产变为常年生产，为采脂基地化、常年化开辟了广阔的道路。崇安化工厂去年第四季度采用化学采脂的方法，产脂量比1958年同期提高了两倍；今年春季天气转暖以后，采用化学采脂，每株松树每天平均的产脂量比冬季又增长近一倍。
    南平、长汀、建瓯等地推广化学采脂以后，产脂量都普遍提高。南平专区各县五千多个采脂工人，在普遍推广了崇安县采脂工人创造的化学采脂新方法后，采脂量已由原来每人每天十几斤迅速提高到四十斤左右，每株松树的出脂率平均由一两猛增到三、四两以上，因而使全专区今年松香生产作到了淡季不淡，比去年同期增长了四倍。闽侯、晋江等专区在全面改进了采脂、炼制松香的技术以后，都超额完成了第一季度的松香生产计划。长汀松香厂依靠职工群众大闹技术革新以后，改进了多项关键性的生产工序，做到了采脂化学化，送脂全部用车船，炼制松香和送料靠自流，流油用竹管，摆脱了繁重的体力劳动，使全厂松香产量比去年同期提高了六倍，同时还节省了三万个劳动日和七万元资金。
    为了高速度发展松香生产，各地都加强了对松香生产的具体领导。南平、建瓯、尤溪等产脂区都成立了化学采脂指挥部或试验小组，推广化学采脂的经验。各产脂区人民公社也组织了化学采脂专业队，在县委的统一领导下，全面推行“四定”（定人、定任务、定报酬、定奖励）、“四包”（包采、包运、包质、包量），积极改进经营管理，争取今年松香生产大丰收。
