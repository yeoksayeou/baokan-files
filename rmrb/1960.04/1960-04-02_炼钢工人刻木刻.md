Steelworkers Carve Woodcuts

Woodcut by Song Enhou, a worker at Wuhan Iron and Steel Company

The vast number of employees at Wuhan Iron and Steel Company deeply feel the great care of the Party for our workers' amateur art activities, which has led to the rapid development of our amateur art creation. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the mass art movement has become even more active, and printmaking has also begun to develop. In the past, almost no workers engaged in printmaking, and no one even thought about it. Since the Great Leap Forward, everyone has been inspired by the new situation. In the mass art movement, we boldly broke down superstitions and brought into play the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and everyone started to work on printmaking. However, learning printmaking is a very complex matter. You must be able to draw, carve, and print. If you are doing color woodcuts, you must also be able to register colors, mix colors... But these problems did not deter our determination to learn printmaking. In the beginning, only two or three people were involved. At that time, we encountered many difficulties in carving and printing, so some people lacked confidence and thought that workers could only do cartoons and propaganda posters in their spare time and that it was impossible to do printmaking at all. However, with the timely care and encouragement of the Party and the organization, we broke down superstitious ideas, studied together, and looked at some reference books on printmaking techniques. We gradually mastered some basic knowledge, and our confidence grew slowly. We started by learning to carve black and white woodcuts, and then we learned to do color woodcuts. We also tried some other printmaking techniques, such as lithography, paper prints, plaster prints, and woodblock printing with water-based inks. In the process of learning, we also continuously received help from the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Artists Association and the Hubei Provincial Mass Art Museum, which gave us great support in all aspects and often sent people to Wuhan Iron and Steel to provide guidance, which gradually improved our printmaking creation. The "Third National Print Exhibition," the "Zhanjiang Print Exhibition," and the "Beijing-Moscow Print Joint Exhibition" held in Wuhan at that time were very good lessons for us printmaking enthusiasts, which helped us a lot both politically and artistically. In the past, comrades only saw print works published in newspapers and magazines, and rarely saw the originals, especially such high-level prints; this aroused everyone's interest even more. More and more people participated in printmaking, forming a printmaking team. Everyone used their spare time with full political enthusiasm to create many works full of ideological and artistic content, which played a significant role in coordinating with the central task and motivating production. For example, Zhang Shanmei's "Ma Guoliu Saves the Locomotive at the Risk of His Life" created in coordination with the central movement, Wang Guizhou's "You Wenxiang Runs a School," and Zhang Yuan's "Learning Culture" all achieved good results.
    In order to make printmaking creation more prosperous, the organization held a painting exhibition with printmaking participating on New Year's Day in 1959. The printmaking section was warmly welcomed by the employees. Through this exhibition, we not only summarized the experience of creation and activities, and collected the opinions of the audience; but also through organizing visits and discussions, everyone's enthusiasm for printmaking creation became higher and the number of people increased. Almost all engineering companies, factories, stations, departments, and offices had people engaged in various printmaking activities, truly spreading throughout Wuhan Iron and Steel. In order to further develop printmaking, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Art Creation and Research Society "Printmaking Professional Group" was established. Now this printmaking group has 32 people regularly participating in activities, 19 of whom are workers, and 2 of whom are members of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Artists Association. The printmaking group holds activities twice a month. In each activity, in addition to gathering the group members' new works and sketches for observation, mutual learning and exchange of experience, and mutual suggestions, we also strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, the Party's policies and guidelines, and current affairs, so as to improve political thought and class consciousness, clarify the direction, and further implement the policy of serving proletarian politics, production, and the masses in art work; so that art, this weapon, can play a greater role in motivating the Great Leap Forward and promoting the continuous leap forward of production.
    At present, we are also preparing the Wuhan Iron and Steel Employee Amateur Printmaking Exhibition. All printmaking enthusiasts are actively creating, using printmaking to depict the "History of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction."
    In the past year or so, we have been learning, researching, and creating, from not understanding to being able to create. We have successively created many relatively good works, some of which have been published in newspapers and magazines. Through these works, we have introduced to the people of the whole country how Wuhan Iron and Steel is carrying out its magnificent construction under the correct leadership of the Party and how happy the lives of the employees are. For example, "Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace Under Construction," which participated in the Fourth National Print Exhibition, was one of Li Jiewen's woodcuts in his early learning period. The color woodcut "Main Road to the Factory Area" by Yuan Fang, the monochrome woodcut "Pouring Steel Ingots" by Wang Guizhou, and the monochrome woodcuts "Installing Crane Beams" and "Great Leap Forward at Wuhan Iron and Steel" by Qu Xuetai, as well as the monochrome woodcut "Switchman" by Zhang Shanmei, all received good reviews from all aspects. From these works, we can see the creative talents and rich wisdom of the employees. The biggest feature of their works is that they are good at drawing nourishment from life to enrich their creation.
    The amateur printmaking activities of Wuhan Iron and Steel employees are unprecedentedly active. We believe that under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policies, with the help of professional printmakers, and closely combined with production, we will surely continue to develop and grow.

    炼钢工人刻木刻
    木刻武汉钢铁公司工人　宋恩厚
    武钢的广大职工，都深深地感到伟大的党对我们职工群众业余美术活动的深切关怀，使我们的业余美术创作有了迅速的发展。特别是1958年大跃进以来，群众美术运动更加活跃了，版画创作也开始发展起来。过去我们工人几乎没人搞过版画，甚至连想都没人想。大跃进以来，大家受到了新形势的鼓舞，在群众大搞文艺运动中，大胆地破除了迷信，发挥了敢想、敢干的创造精神，大家才动手搞版画。不过，学习版画是一件很复杂的事，必须会画、会刻、会印刷，如果是搞套色木刻，那还要会套色、调色……。但是这些问题并没有难住我们要学版画的决心。开始时虽然只有两三个人搞，当时又遇到了很多刻印上的困难，于是有的人信心便不足了，认为工人在业余时间只能搞搞漫画、宣传画，根本不可能搞版画，但是在党和组织上的及时关怀和鼓励下，破除了迷信思想，大家在一起互相研究，又看了一些版画技法方面的参考书籍，便逐步地掌握了一些基本的知识，这样我们的信心也就慢慢的大起来。开始先学刻黑白木刻，后来又学着搞套色木刻，还试搞了一些其他版画，如石版、纸版、石膏版和木版水印等。在学习的过程中，又不断地得到中国美术家协会武汉分会和湖北省群众艺术馆的帮助，在各方面都给予我们很大的支持，还经常派人来武钢进行指导，使我们的版画创作逐步有了提高。当时在武汉举办的“第三届全国版画展览”、“湛江版画展览”和“北京—莫斯科版画联合展览”等，对于我们这些版画爱好者更是上了几堂很好的课，不论在政治思想上或艺术上都对我们帮助很大。过去同志们看到版画作品，都是在报刊杂志上发表的，很少看见原作，特别像这样水平很高的版画；由此更引起了大家的兴趣。参加搞版画的人也逐渐多了起来，形成了一支版画队伍，大家以饱满的政治热情，利用业余时间，创作出了许多富有思想性和艺术性的作品；在配合中心、鼓动生产上起到了不小的作用；如张善美在配合中心运动中创作的“马国六舍身救机车”，王贵洲的“由文祥办学”，张远的“学文化”等，都收到了良好的效果。
    组织上为了使版画创作更加繁荣，在1959年元旦时举办了一次有版画参加的打擂画展，其中版画部分受到了职工们的热烈欢迎。通过这次画展，不仅总结了创作与活动的经验，收集了观众的意见；而且通过组织参观、座谈，使大家对版画创作的情绪更加高涨，人数也更加增多了；差不多各工程公司、厂、站、部、处等单位都有搞各种版画的，真是遍及武钢。为了更进一步发展版画，又成立了武钢美术创作研究社“版画专业小组”，现在这个版画小组，已有三十二人经常参加活动，其中有十九人是工人，有两人已是中国美术家协会武汉分会的会员。版画组每月活动两次，在每次活动中除把组员的新作品和草图集中观摩，互相学习交流经验，互相提意见外；同时，还加强学习毛主席文艺思想、党的方针政策和时事，以便提高政治思想和阶级觉悟，明确方向，进一步贯彻美术工作为无产阶级政治、为生产、为群众服务的方针；使美术这一武器，在大跃进中起更大的鼓动作用和促进生产不断的跃进。
    目前我们又在筹备武钢职工业余版画展览会，所有的版画爱好者们都在积极地进行创作，用版画形式描写“武钢建厂史”。
    一年多以来，就这样边学、边研究，边创作，由不懂到能创作，我们已先后创作出了许多比较好的作品，有的还在报刊上发表过；通过这些作品，向全国人民介绍了在党的正确领导下，武钢是怎样的进行着宏伟的建设和职工们的生活是多么的幸福。例如参加第四届全国版画展览的“武钢一号高炉在建设中”就是李介文初学时期中的一幅木刻。参加湖北省建国十周年美展的有远方试搞的套色木刻“通往厂区的要道”，有王贵洲的单色木刻“注钢锭”和屈学泰的单色木刻“安装吊车梁”、“武钢大跃进”，以及张善美的单色木刻“搬道员”等，都得到了各方面的好评。从这些作品里可以看出职工们的创作才能和丰富的智慧。他们的作品的最大特色是善于从生活中吸取养料，来丰富自己的创作。
    武钢的职工业余版画活动，是空前地活跃起来了，我们相信在党的文艺方针指导下，在专业版画家的帮助下，紧密地和生产相结合，一定会不断得到发展和成长。
