    Continue to Uphold the Mass Anti-Drought and Drought Prevention Movement

    The current rural situation is extremely good. After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests, and after carrying out the socialist education-centered rectification movement, the soaring agricultural production situation is victoriously developing forward. But the better the situation, the more we must see the problems in our progress. One of the problems that should be given high priority at present is the prevention and overcoming of various natural disasters, especially the prevention and overcoming of drought.

    This year's spring drought occurred early and over a wide area. More than a dozen provinces and regions from north to south have experienced spring droughts successively. The affected area reached more than 500 million mu at its peak, and many of these areas experienced spring drought again after last year's severe drought. However, thanks to the close attention of leaders in various places and their early action, especially the strong confidence and high morale of the vast number of peasants in overcoming this year's drought due to their experience in overcoming the extraordinarily severe drought last year and achieving a bumper agricultural harvest, as soon as the spring drought emerged, the vast number of peasants, with the fighting stance of "not relying on heaven, not begging the earth, people seize water when the sky does not rain, and a bumper harvest depends on me, not heaven," launched a vigorous mass drought prevention and anti-drought movement. More than 7 million people in Henan Province participated in the drought resistance effort, irrigating more than 60 million mu of wheat fields in a little over a month. The wheat seedlings are generally growing well now. Sichuan Province launched a massive drought resistance struggle as soon as the signs of drought appeared, truly achieving "thousands of carts and buckets along the banks of small rivers, thousands of troops and horses on both sides of high mountains, intercepting rivers along the banks, opening canals on cliffs, water from rivers going up the mountains, and water from rivers returning to the fields." More than 95% of the province's wheat and rapeseed have been watered twice in combination with fertilization, and they are now growing very vigorously. Through the tenacious struggle of the vast number of peasants, the spring drought in the southern region has been overcome after late March, and the drought situation in some other regions has also been alleviated to a certain extent. Now, the wheat in the south has been successively harvested in abundance. Fujian has completed the harvest, Guangdong and Guangxi have mostly completed the harvest, and Yunnan and Guizhou have partially completed the harvest, all with significant increases in production compared to last year. This is the first great achievement of this year's drought resistance struggle. However, it must also be seen that the drought situation in some areas, especially north of the Huai River and in the Yellow River basin, is still very serious, and some areas are continuing to develop. At present, the drought-affected area in Shanxi is still around 20 million mu, and the more severely drought-affected area in Shandong is still around 40 million mu. Other areas such as Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei, and some areas in the Northeast also have considerable drought-affected areas. According to statistics from relevant departments, the drought-affected area of wheat land and spring-sown land in the country is still over 100 million mu, and it is concentrated in the Yellow River basin and north of the Huai River. As everyone knows, the Yellow River and Huai River basins are the main wheat producing areas in our country. The wheat in this area is currently in the jointing period and needs watering; this area is currently in the spring sowing season and also requires a large amount of moisture and sufficient soil moisture. We must continue the drought resistance struggle and continue to uphold the mass anti-drought movement on the basis of the great victory we have already achieved.

    Agricultural production is a struggle for mankind to wage war against nature and to make nature obediently serve mankind. To get the earth to yield more grain and cotton and other agricultural products, on the one hand, we must carefully strengthen the management of crops, adding water and fertilizer so that crops can fully exploit their potential and increase yields; on the other hand, we must prevent and resist disasters in a timely manner to create a good environment for the smooth growth of crops. Only when these two aspects of work are done better can we make our agricultural production develop more smoothly. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, through the efforts of the people throughout the country, our ability to resist natural disasters has been greatly strengthened. Taking the water and drought disasters that are most serious to agricultural production as an example, after ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, several upsurges in water conservancy construction, our water conservancy construction has achieved great achievements. According to the design capacity of water conservancy projects, the irrigated area in the country has been expanded to more than one billion mu, accounting for about 60% of the total cultivated land. However, as Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out in his report on "Striving to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule" at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress: "Building reservoirs does not mean that the irrigated area calculated according to the project has already received practical benefits. Water must be stored, canals must be built, land must be leveled, and water lifting tools must be prepared before actual benefits can be realized. Some projects, especially large-scale projects, cannot generate benefits in the same year, or cannot generate full benefits, and often take until the second or even the third year to generate full benefits." The fact is that although the water conservancy projects we have built are calculated according to design capacity and have reached more than one billion mu of irrigated area, only about 610 million mu have actually reached the drought resistance capacity of 30 days, 50 days, or 70 days. Even if the drought resistance capacity reaches 30 days, 50 days, or 70 days, it is still far from the requirement of "guaranteeing a bumper harvest without rain for 100 days." Therefore, to eradicate natural disasters such as water and drought, we still need to continue to make tenacious struggles. However, this does not mean that we have no way to overcome natural disasters. Many facts have proven that as long as the broad masses of the people resolutely act and fight tenaciously against disasters, natural disasters can be overcome. Last year, our country suffered the most severe drought in 70 years, but we overcame it and achieved a great victory in the continued leap forward in agricultural production. This spring, many areas experienced spring drought again after last year's severe drought, and the vast areas overcame it again, ensuring the lush growth of summer harvest crops and the victorious progress of spring sowing. These facts vividly illustrate that under the strong leadership of our Party, the people are an extremely great force. As long as the broad masses actively act and wage a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, they can overcome disasters and achieve a bumper harvest.

    Our unwavering belief that spring drought can be overcome does not mean that spring drought can be taken lightly. There should be no slightest麻痹（paralysis) in dealing with spring drought, and preparations should be made ideologically and in action for a long-term, arduous, and repeated struggle with spring drought.

    Natural disasters are originally a bad thing, but the people of our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can regard the difficulties brought about by drought as a driving force to promote production and water conservancy construction, and turn bad things into good things. Many places take drought resistance as a driving force to build water conservancy projects that cost less, benefit quickly, and benefit more. Through drought resistance, the water conservancy movement is pushed to a new stage, shifting from passive drought resistance to active elimination of drought, and combining current drought resistance with long-term drought prevention. Henan, Hebei, Shandong and other places are building machine wells on a large scale, making full use of groundwater, which is a drought resistance measure that uses less materials, requires less labor, and yields quick results, and can have an immediate effect. Since this spring, in just a few months, Henan has dug more than 78,000 machine wells, and the area of "double insurance" of well-canal irrigation in the province has reached more than 30 million mu, greatly reducing the threat of drought. This practice of "finding water on the ground when there is no water in the sky, and finding water underground when there is no water on the ground," using "three waters" of sky water, ground water, and underground water in parallel, is the fundamental principle of our water conservancy construction. "Double insurance of wells and reservoirs" is the high standard for our future water conservancy construction. Only by achieving this step can we achieve a guaranteed harvest in both drought and flood. It is unrealistic to require all places to reach this level in a short period of time, but according to the experience of Henan, building machine wells on a large scale is not a difficult thing. Because they have vigorously promoted technological innovation and created "rocket cones" suitable for various geological conditions, they can now dig a machine well in a dozen hours. Digging a machine well that can irrigate dozens of mu a day in a dozen hours, is there any insurmountable difficulty for us who are determined to overcome drought? Opening up new water sources, as mentioned above, is a money-saving and labor-saving way for us to overcome drought. Making full use of the effectiveness of existing projects, saving water, and planning water use so that every drop of water can exert its maximum effect is another effective way for us to overcome drought. Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has adopted measures such as channel lining, channel sets, garden plots, crop adjustment, collecting small streams, and introducing floods, so that a flow rate of water can irrigate 200,000 mu of land, setting up a red flag in terms of economical water use. At present, the national average flow rate irrigates less than 50,000 mu of land. If we universally promote the experience of economical water use in Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, and strive to increase the irrigation of 100,000 mu of land per flow rate, we can double our drought resistance strength and double the irrigated area.

    Making full use of various highly efficient improved tools created in the drought resistance struggle is a very important aspect of our victory over drought. Currently, it is the busy season for spring plowing, and all aspects urgently need a large amount of labor. In any aspect, it is necessary to improve efficiency and save labor in order to do a good job. The drought prevention and anti-drought struggle also needs to pay attention to this issue so that it can not only affect other aspects of production and labor, but also do a good job in drought prevention and anti-drought work. Of course, there are many ways to achieve this goal, but the most important is to create and promote improved and new water conservancy tools. For example, Hebei Province is building low-pressure steam waterwheels on a large scale to support drought resistance. This kind of "cow-free" waterwheel can irrigate 20 to 30 mu of land a day, which is more than four times more efficient than animal-powered waterwheels. In the drought resistance struggle, the vast number of members of the Shuangxing Brigade of Suqiao Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, carried out tool reforms on a large scale, making full use of old materials and existing agricultural tools to transform and newly build dozens of wind-powered waterwheels, which increased the efficiency of water pumping and irrigation by about ten times. Originally, all the labor force was invested in drought resistance, which was still more than 50,000 workdays short. Now, after making full use of improved tools, the manpower has changed from insufficient to surplus, and spring plowing production has been done even more outstandingly.

    Strengthening Party leadership and organizing communist-style large-scale collaboration is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the drought resistance production movement. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. In order to promote the high-speed and proportionate development of the entire national economy, the Second National People's Congress has made a decision, calling on people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life across the country to support the development of agriculture. This support should first be reflected in spring production and the drought resistance struggle carried out to victoriously complete the spring plowing production task. Various departments, especially industrial departments and financial and trade departments, have already made great achievements in the drought resistance struggle: the industrial departments have listed the machinery and materials necessary for drought resistance as the first-line task and arranged production in advance; organized technical workers to go to the countryside to help repair machines and provide technical guidance; the transportation departments worked overtime to rush the transportation of drought resistance materials; the commercial departments, adhering to the principle of "arranging first, allocating first, and supplying first" for drought resistance materials, transported drought resistance materials and equipment to the rural areas as soon as possible; other departments, such as scientific research departments, seized the time to solve technical problems in drought resistance production, and medical and health departments at all levels organized a large number of medical personnel to go to the countryside and mountains, proposing that wherever there is a drought resistance army, there are white-clad warriors; cadres of organs, school students, and local troops actively participated in the drought resistance struggle of nearby people's communes, all of which have played a significant role in the struggle to overcome spring drought. This kind of mobilization of all walks of life, with workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers twisted into one rope, working together to fight drought, has not only strongly supported the drought resistance struggle and powerfully promoted the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, but also further strengthened the work of all aspects and departments and promoted the all-round great leap forward in the national economy. However, it should also be pointed out that the work of some departments in supporting the drought resistance struggle is not satisfactory. For example, the steel pipes and iron pipes needed for drainage and irrigation machinery have not completed the production plan and supply plan for the first quarter, and these departments should catch up quickly.

    In the drought resistance struggle, various places have greatly promoted the communist spirit and widely carried out large-scale collaboration, leaving the difficulties to themselves and making the convenience available to others, which is the most important guarantee for our victory in the drought resistance struggle and the continued achievement of new and greater victories. Bangshan Commune in Longxi County, Fujian Province, supported the neighboring commune with canal water when water was most needed during the drought, enabling the neighboring Lianhua Commune to successfully carry out spring plowing on 15,000 mu of early rice fields. Overcoming difficulties, they re-opened canals to divert water and also completed the spring plowing task in a timely manner, with more than 4,000 mu of rice seedlings growing lush and strong in every plot. However, there are also individual places where parochialism still exists, only seeing themselves and not seeing the overall situation. Although this is only a very individual phenomenon, this influence of the bourgeoisie should be resolutely overcome.

    Drought is a great threat to agricultural production at present, which has increased the difficulties for us in realizing the task of continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. But drought has not and cannot scare us. We believe that as long as Party committees at all levels strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, give full play to the unparalleled power of the people's communes, organize communist-style large-scale collaboration among various departments and aspects, and continue to uphold the mass anti-drought and drought prevention struggle, we will definitely be able to finally overcome drought, ensure the victorious progress of spring plowing production and a greater bumper harvest of summer harvest crops, and create favorable conditions for realizing a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year. Our slogan for action is: "Thoroughly overcome spring drought, prevent summer drought, strive for a greater summer harvest, and realize a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in agricultural production throughout the year!"

    继续坚持群众性的抗旱防旱运动
    今年农村形势极为良好。经过连续两年的大跃进、大丰收，经过开展以社会主义教育为中心的整社运动，步步高涨的农业生产形势正在胜利地往前发展。但形势愈好，我们愈是要看到前进中的问题。当前应当引起我们高度重视的问题之一，就是防止和战胜各种自然灾害，特别是防止和战胜旱灾。
    今年的春旱发生得早，面也很广。从北方到南方十几个省区都曾先后发生春旱，受旱面积最多时曾达五亿多亩，其中许多地区是在去年大旱之后又出现春旱的。但是，由于各地领导上抓得紧，动手早，特别是广大农民由于有了去年战胜特大旱灾取得农业大丰收的经验，对于战胜今年的旱灾信心很强，斗志很高，春旱刚露头，广大农民就以“不靠天，不求地，天不下雨人夺水，丰收在我不在天”的战斗姿态，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性的防旱抗旱运动。河南省七百多万人参加抗旱，一个多月春灌麦田六千多万亩，目前麦苗生长一般都好。四川省在旱象刚一露头就展开了声势浩大的抗旱斗争，真正做到了“小河沿岸，千车万桶，高山两侧，千军万马，沿河截流，悬崖开渠，江水上山，河水归田”，对全省95％以上的小麦和油菜，结合施肥已浇水两次，现在都长得很茁壮。经过广大农民的顽强斗争，3月下旬以后，南方地区的春旱已被战胜，其他一些地区的旱情也有了一定程度的缓和，现在，南方的小麦已经陆续丰收。福建已全部收完，广东、广西大部分收完，云南、贵州一部分收完，都比去年有很大增产。这是今年抗旱斗争的第一个伟大成果。但是也要看到还有一些地区，特别是淮河以北和黄河流域旱情仍很严重，有些地区还在继续发展。目前，山西受旱面积仍在二千亩左右，山东比较严重的受旱面积仍在四千万亩左右，其他如甘肃、陕西、河北以及东北一些地区受旱面积也不小，据有关部门统计，现在全国小麦地和春播地受旱面积仍在一亿亩以上，而且集中在黄河流域及淮河以北。大家知道，黄河、淮河流域是我国小麦的主要产区，这个地区的小麦正在拔节期间，需要浇水；这个地区目前正是春播季节，也需要大量的水分和足够的底墒。我们必须在已经取得的巨大胜利的基础上，继续抗旱斗争，继续坚持群众性的抗旱运动。
    农业生产是人类向大自然开战，要自然为人类驯顺服务的斗争。要想大地交出更多的粮食和棉花等农产品，一方面要精心加强农作物的管理，加水加肥，使农作物能够充分发挥潜力，增加产量，另一方面要及时防灾、抗灾，为农作物的顺利生长创造良好的环境。只有这两方面的工作做得更好了，我们才能够使我们的农业生产更顺利地向前发展。建国以来，经过全国人民的努力，我们抗御自然灾害的能力是大大加强了，以危害农业生产最严重的水旱灾害为例，经过十年来，特别是大跃进以来几次水利建设高潮，我们的水利建设已经取得了巨大的成就。按照水利工程的设计能力，全国的灌溉面积已扩大到十亿多亩，占全部耕地60％左右。但是，正如谭震林同志在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告中所指出的：“修好了水库，并不等于按工程计算的灌溉面积都已经收到实际效益，还必须蓄上水，修好渠道，平整好土地，准备好提水工具，才能实际发挥效益。有的工程，特别是大型工程，在当年并不能发挥效益，或则不能充分发挥效益，往往要到第二年甚至第三年才能充分发挥效益。”事实正是这样的，虽然我们修建的水利工程按设计能力计算，已经达到十亿亩以上的灌溉面积，但真正达到三十天、五十天、七十天抗旱能力的只有六亿一千万亩左右，即使抗旱能力达到了三十天、五十天、七十天，但同“百日无雨保丰收”的要求还有距离，所以要根除水、旱等自然灾害，还需要继续作顽强的斗争。但是，这并不是说，我们就没有办法战胜自然灾害了。许多的事实已经证明，只要广大人民群众坚决地行动起来，顽强地同灾害进行斗争，自然灾害是可以被战胜的。去年，我国遭受了七十年来最严重的旱灾，但我们战胜了它，取得了农业生产继续跃进的伟大胜利；今年春天，许多地区在去年大旱之后，又出现了春旱，广大地区又战胜了它，保证了夏收作物的繁茂生长和春播的胜利进行。这些事实生动地说明，在我们党的坚强领导下，人民群众是极其伟大的力量，只要广大群众积极行动起来，同自然灾害进行顽强的斗争，就能战胜灾害，取得丰收。
    我们坚定不移地相信春旱是可以战胜的，并不等于说春旱是可以轻视的。对待春旱不能有丝毫的麻痹，应在思想上、行动上作好和春旱进行长期艰苦斗争和反复斗争的准备。
    自然灾害本来是一件坏事，但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国人民，可以把干旱带来的困难，当作推动生产、推动水利建设不断前进的动力，把坏事变为好事。许多地方以抗旱为动力，大兴花钱少、受益快、受益多的水利工程，通过抗旱把水利运动推向一个新的阶段，由被动的抗旱转向主动的消灭干旱，把当前的抗旱与长远的防旱结合起来。河南、河北、山东等地大建机井，充分利用地下水，这是一个用材少、费工小、收效快的抗旱措施，可以立竿见影。今春以来，仅几个月的时间，河南已挖机井七万八千多眼，全省实现井渠灌溉“双保险”的面积已达三千多万亩。大大减轻了干旱的威胁。这种“天上无水地上找，地上无水地下寻”的天上水、地上水、地下水“三水并用”的作法，是我们水利建设的根本方针，“井库双保险”则是我们将来进行水利建设的高标准，只有作到了这一步，我们才能做到旱涝保丰收。在暂短的时间内，要求所有的地方都能作到这种程度是不现实的，但是，根据河南的经验，大打机井也不是什么了不得的困难的事情。他们由于大搞技术革新，创造了适合各种地质情况的“火箭锥”，已经能在十几个小时内打一眼机井。十几个小时打一眼一天能浇几十亩的机井，对于决心战胜旱灾的我们说来，有什么了不得的困难呢？开辟新的水源，如上所述，是我们战胜旱灾的一个省钱、省力的办法。充分发挥现有工程的效益，节省用水、计划用水，使每一滴水都能发挥它的最大作用，是我们战胜旱灾的又一个有效办法。甘肃省榆中县兴隆峡灌溉区采取渠道衬砌、渠道成套、园田成片、调整作物、汇集细流和引进洪水等办法，使一个流量的水能浇二十万亩土地，在经济用水方面树立了一面红旗。目前，全国平均一个流量灌地还不到五万亩，如果普遍推广甘肃榆中县兴隆峡灌溉区经济用水的经验，力争提高到一个流量灌地十万亩，我们就能成倍地增加抗旱的力量，成倍地扩大灌溉面积。
    充分利用在抗旱斗争中创造出来的各种各样的效率很高的改良工具，是我们战胜干旱的一个很重要的方面。当前，正值春耕大忙季节，各方面都急需大量劳力，无论哪方面，都需要提高效率，节省劳力，才能把工作做好。防旱抗旱斗争，也需要注意这个问题，才能既不影响其他方面的生产和劳动，也能够把抗旱防旱工作做好。当然，达到这个目的的方法很多，但最主要的还是创造和推广改良的和新式的水利工具，例如河北省正在大造低压蒸汽水车，支援抗旱。这种“无牛”水车一天能浇地二、三十亩，比畜力水车提高工效四倍以上。福建省晋江县苏厝公社双星大队广大社员在抗旱斗争中，大搞工具改革，充分利用旧料和现有农具，改造和新造了几十架风力水车，提高了车水灌溉工效十倍左右，原来全部劳力投入抗旱还差五万多工，现在充分利用改良工具后，人力由不足变有余，春耕生产搞得更加出色。
    加强党的领导，组织共产主义大协作，是抗旱生产运动取得胜利的根本保证。农业是国民经济发展的基础。为了促进整个国民经济的高速度地按比例地发展，第二届全国人民代表大会已经作出决定，号召全国各族人民和各行各业都来支援农业的发展。这种支援应该首先表现在春季生产和为了胜利完成春耕生产任务而开展的抗旱斗争上。各个部门，特别是工业部门和财贸部门，在抗旱斗争中已经作出了很大的成绩：工业部门将抗旱所必需的机械、物资列为第一线任务，提前安排生产；组织技术工人下乡帮助检修机器，进行技术指导；交通运输部门加班赶运抗旱物资；商业部门对抗旱物资本着“安排在先，调拨在先，供应在先”的原则，尽快把抗旱物资、器材运往农村；其他如科学研究部门抓紧解决抗旱生产中的技术问题，各级卫生医疗部门组织大批医疗人员下乡上山，他们提出哪里有抗旱大军，哪里就有白衣战士；机关干部和学校学生以及当地驻军积极参加附近人民公社的抗旱斗争，都已经在战胜春旱的斗争中发挥了重大的作用。这种各行各业齐出动，工农商学兵扭成一股劲，同心协力与干旱进行斗争，不仅有力地支援了抗旱斗争，有力地促进了农业生产的继续大跃进，也进一步加强了各方面各部门的工作，促进了国民经济的全面大跃进。但是，也应该指出，有些部门在支援抗旱斗争中，工作是做得不能令人满意的，比如排灌机械所需要的钢管和铁管，就没有完成第一季度的生产计划和供应计划，这些部门应该赶快赶上来。
    各地在抗旱斗争中大大发扬了共产主义精神，广泛地开展了大协作，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，这是我们取得抗旱斗争胜利和继续取得新的更伟大胜利的最重要的保证。福建省龙溪县榜山公社在天旱最需水的时候把渠水支援邻社，使邻近的莲花公社一万五千亩早稻田顺利春耕，自己克服困难，重新开渠引水，也及时完成了春耕任务，四千多亩秧苗丘丘长得油绿粗壮。但是也有个别地方仍然存在着本位主义，只看见自己，看不到全局。虽然这只是极个别的现象，但是这种资产阶级的影响，应当坚决克服。
    干旱是当前农业生产上的一个很大的威胁，它给我们实现今年农业生产继续跃进的任务增加了困难。但是干旱并没有也不可能吓倒我们，我们相信，只要各级党委加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发挥人民公社的无比威力，组织各部门、各方面的共产主义大协作，继续坚持群众性的抗旱防旱斗争，我们一定能最后战胜干旱，保证春耕生产胜利进行和夏收作物更大丰收，为实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进创造有利条件。我们的行动口号是：“彻底战胜春旱，防止夏旱，争取夏季更大丰收，实现全年农业生产更好更全面的继续跃进！”
