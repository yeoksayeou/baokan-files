    Bringing Agricultural Loans to the Mountainous Areas
    Wen Kui, Agricultural Loan Officer, Xincheng District Bank of the People's Bank of China, Xi'an City

    Some say the mountainous areas are tough; are they really that tough? No, anyone who lives in the mountains for a while will surely fall in love with them. The smell of the soil on the mountain slopes, the fresh fragrance in the young forests, the cuckoo's call, the singing during labor – all these will make you feel how happy and meaningful life is, and how beautiful our motherland is!

    We are agricultural loan officers in the mountainous areas, our work locations are scattered, and the scope of contact is wide. Sometimes, for a single loan, we have to cross several mountain peaks and travel hundreds of miles of mountain roads. Our legs are sore, our stomachs are hungry, and our bodies are tired, but as long as we see that the irrigation canal here has grown longer, and the newly planted forest there has sprouted new buds, see the wheat seedlings are so green and strong, and the fruit trees are blooming so white and red, we will forget all the fatigue and feel full of energy, jumping and running forward.

    Arriving at a mountain slope, a village, feels even more intimate than arriving home! The joyful, sincere, and simple faces, bursts of laughter and singing, jokes and amusing words, and groups of lively and healthy children running all over the slopes, all make you feel indescribably kind and gratified. The mountainous areas are changing so rapidly! If you don't go for three days, you might not even recognize it.

    Through agricultural loans, we have become one family with the mountain people. We not only participate in production through agricultural loans, becoming good advisors, but also eat, live, and work with the mountain people. When we see that agricultural loans can help the community engage in more production and more sideline occupations; when we see that the community's canteen, aided by agricultural loan funds, is more presentable, and the accounting work is more sound; when we see that the livestock and poultry in the pig farms, chicken farms, and rabbit farms established with the help of agricultural loan funds are fattening up and growing up; when we see that, at our suggestion, a collaborative meeting of industry, agriculture, commerce, banking, and finance has been convened, accelerating production speed, improving quality, and smoothly completing pest control and prevention work... we feel so happy!

    Carrying water, watering wheat, fighting drought together with the mountain people, harvesting abundant crops together under the scorching sun, compacting the soil on the canal banks together with labor calls, chatting and singing together during labor breaks, overcoming temporary difficult days together, spending joyful seasons together, and running together on the socialist road, all this has made our hearts take root and settle down in the mountainous areas.

    After a day of running around, on the way home, perhaps because it's dark we can't see the road and slip, perhaps we encounter heavy rain on the way and get soaked to the skin, perhaps we encounter wolves in the evening, perhaps a strong sandstorm arises, blinding us and making it difficult to move an inch... but what does it matter? Compared to the comrades working heroically in even more difficult environments, we really are nothing. When we think of the magnificent and splendid development prospects of the countryside, when we think of everyone doing their best to achieve the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, we feel our strength is doubled and we become even more courageous and forward-looking.

    Mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy have brought another beautiful spring to the mountainous areas like thunder. Look, the children are staring in amazement at the electric lights; the old people, with hands that have held plows passed down for generations, are stroking the tractors; the girls are gathered in a circle watching and discussing how the distribution panel makes the magical electricity run to the fields. Yes, the mountainous areas are leaping forward on the socialist road, its pace so strong and fast! "This is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao!" The mountain people say in a simple and sincere way, expressing the source of people's happiness.

    We are advancing with the people of the mountainous areas, running together with the motherland on the broad road of socialism!

    把农贷送进山区
    中国人民银行西安市新城区银行农贷员　文奎
    有人说山区苦，山区真的苦吗？不，谁如果在山区住上些时候，谁就一定会爱上它的。山坡上的泥土气息，幼树林里的清香，布谷鸟的啼鸣，劳动中的歌声，都会使你感到生活是多么幸福，多么有意义，祖国河山是多么美好！
    我们是山区的农贷员，工作地点分散，联系面广。有时为了一笔贷款，要翻过几座山头，跑上百里的山路。腿跑酸了，肚子跑饿了，身子跑乏了，可是只要一看到这里的灌溉渠又长了一段，那边新栽的树林也吐出了新芽，看到麦苗是那么绿油油的壮实，果树的花开的那么白、那么红，就会把一身疲累全忘了，就会感到混身是劲，又蹦又跳，向前面跑去了。
    到了一个山坡，一个村子，真比到家还亲切呀！一张张欢乐、真诚、朴实的脸庞，一阵阵嘻笑和歌声，一句句玩笑和趣语，一群群活泼健康满坡跑的孩子，都会使你感到说不出的亲切和欣慰。山区变化得那么急，那么快！如果三天不去，它就有些使你认不得了。
    通过农贷，使我们和山民成了一家人。我们不只是通过农贷去参与生产，成为好参谋，还和山民同吃、同住、同劳动。当我们看到农贷能够帮助社里多搞些生产，多搞些副业；看到社里在农贷金帮助下的食堂更像样了，财会工作更健全了；看到通过农贷金帮助社里建立起来的猪场、鸡场、兔场里的家禽家畜吃肥了，长大了；看到在我们的建议下召开了工、农、商、银、财的协作会议，使生产速度加快了，质量提高了，治虫、防害工作顺利地完成了；……我们是感到多么愉快啊！
    和山民一起背水、浇麦、抗旱，一起在炎日下收割丰硕的庄稼，一起打着劳动号子夯实渠边的土，一起在劳动憩息中谈笑歌唱，一起渡过暂时困难的日子，一起渡过欢乐的季节，一起向社会主义大道上跑，这使我们的心在山区里扎下了根，安下了家。
    奔波了一天以后，在回家的路上也许由于天黑看不见路滑倒了，也许在途中遇上大雨把混身淋得湿透，也许在傍晚的时候碰上狼，也许起了大风沙睁不开眼而寸步难行，……可这有什么关系呢？比起在更加艰苦的环境中豪迈地工作着的同志们，我们真是算不上什么。我们一想到农村的宏伟壮丽的发展前途，一想到大家都在为提前实现农业发展纲要尽自己的全副力量，就觉得力量倍增，更加勇往直前了。
    机械化、电气化、水利化已像春雷一样给山区带来了又一个美丽的春天。看吧，孩子们正用惊奇的眼光出神地注视着电灯；老人们用掌了几十年祖祖辈辈传下来的山犁的手，抚摸着拖拉机；姑娘们围成一团看着、议论着配电盘是怎样使神奇的电跑到田间去的。是呀，山区在社会主义的大道上飞跃前进，它的步伐那么健壮，快速！“这多亏党和毛主席呀！”山民们朴实、诚恳地说出了人们幸福的泉源。
    我们随着山区人民前进，跟着祖国一起在社会主义康庄大道上飞奔！
