Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 14th: Japanese Socialist Party members today revealed at the Special Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the New Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that the Kishi Nobusuke government's military authorities had drawn aeronautical maps including the territories of China and the Soviet Union.

Socialist Party member Ichio Asukata said at the meeting that the maps drawn by the Japanese "Defense Agency" included areas of China such as Yunnan, Guilin, Jinmen, Matsu, and the Northeast, as well as areas of Soviet territory such as Kamchatka. This shows that it considers China and the Soviet Union as enemies. Initially, Akagi lied, saying that the "Defense Agency" had not drawn such maps.

After Asukata questioned him and produced a map labeled No. 281 on the spot, Akagi had no choice but to admit in the face of the facts that the map Asukata produced was "largely likely to be the same" as the one drawn by the "Defense Agency." However, he quickly made a clumsy denial, saying, "But it would be wrong to think it is for invasion and dispatch of troops overseas."

Kishi Nobusuke clearly announced not long ago that the so-called Far East scope of the new "Security Treaty" includes Chinese and Soviet territory, but today he said in response to questions at the meeting that "the Far East scope of the new treaty has nothing to do with this aeronautical map."

    岸政府阴谋策划侵略中苏
    竟绘制包括中苏领土的航空地图
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员今天在众议院新日美“安全条约”问题特别委员会会议上，揭露岸信介政府军事当局绘制包括中国和苏联领土在内的航空地图。
    社会党议员飞鸟田一雄在会上说，日本“防卫厅”绘制的地图包括中国的云南、桂林、金门、马祖和东北等地区以及苏联领土的堪察加等地方。这说明它是以中苏为敌。赤城起初撒谎说，“防卫厅”没有绘制这种地图。
    在飞鸟田追问并当场拿出标号二八一号地图之后，赤城在事实面前只好承认飞鸟田拿出来的地图和“防卫厅”绘制的“大体上可能是一样的”。但是他赶紧此地无银三百两地辩解说：“不过认为它是侵略和派兵到海外用的，那就想错了”。
    岸信介在不久前明确地宣布过，所谓新“安全条约”的远东范围包括中国和苏联领土，但是今天他在会上回答质询时却说，“新条约的远东范围和这幅航空图没有关系”。
