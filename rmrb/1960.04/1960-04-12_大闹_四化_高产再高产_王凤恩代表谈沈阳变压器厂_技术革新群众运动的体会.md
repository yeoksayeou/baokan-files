Comrades,

I fully endorse the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the report on the draft state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. The reports of the two vice premiers present a magnificent and splendid picture of continued leaps forward, giving us tremendous encouragement and strength. I am determined to earnestly implement them in my future work.

Last year was a year of continued great leaps forward in our country's socialist construction, building upon the great leap forward of 1958. Our Shenyang Transformer Factory, like other parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the direct leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, liberated our thinking, broke down superstitions, and continued to carry forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, learning humbly, and creating boldly. Every worker, full of vigor and high morale, extensively and deeply launched a massive and magnificent technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. We learned and applied the experiences of the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performances and the Jiamusi industrial production sports meet, creating a wave of everyone performing, performing everywhere, exchanging experiences, and learning experiences. The labor enthusiasm of the workers rose to an unprecedented level, and production efficiency increased by multiples, tens of times, and hundreds of times. The entire factory, without increasing manpower or equipment, overfulfilled the state plan forty-one days ahead of schedule, on the basis of doubling the output compared to 1958. The broad masses of workers not only had soaring enthusiasm, but also carried forward the communist style of the working class, daring to think and daring to act, with endless technological innovations. Last year alone, our factory realized more than 5,610 technological innovation proposals, manufactured 71 indigenous and foreign equipment, and increased the factory's degree of mechanization from 38% at the beginning of last year to 71.4%. We successfully trial-produced 37 new products. The capacity of a giant transformer we produced last year was equal to the total capacity produced in old China in a year. These achievements are the victory of the Party's general line and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our workshop, under the specific leadership of the Party committee, has also made great achievements after a year of hard work. Last year, the entire workshop proposed 300 technological innovation projects and realized more than 200 of them. We manufactured 23 units of indigenous equipment and more than 50 kinds of major tooling. Through extensive reforms and new creations of the original equipment by the broad masses of workers, the production outlook of our workshop has been greatly changed, and the degree of mechanization has increased from the original 30% to 80%, liberating 105 workers from heavy manual labor, doubling the production capacity of the workshop, changing the past weak links of the entire factory, and also drawing 35 workers to support fraternal units, completing the annual production task 70 days ahead of schedule, becoming an advanced workshop in the entire factory. How were these achievements obtained? Our experience is:

	Solving Ideological Problems, Vigorously Launching Mass Movements

With the continuous great leap forward on various fronts, the Party and the state demanded that we make more, bigger, and better transformers, but the production volume of our workshop was far from meeting the needs of the great leap forward. According to our then capacity, we could only complete 300,000 to 400,000 kVA, but the factory required us to do 800,000, 900,000, or even 1.1 million tasks per month. Without increasing manpower or equipment, and still overfulfilling the task, how to solve this contradiction? There were two kinds of thinking and two kinds of practices: one was that a few people reached out to the factory for manpower and equipment, believing that technological innovation was "a distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst." In contrast, the majority of people advocated self-reliance, collective wisdom, and vigorously carrying out technological revolution. The workshop Party branch seized these two kinds of thinking, convened a workers' meeting, and conducted a great debate. After debate and organizing forums with advanced producers and veteran workers, visiting and exchanging experiences, and repeatedly carrying out ideological mobilization, the broad masses of workers were full of energy and fought day and night. Even Sun Jingru, who rarely engaged in creation in the past, came early and left late to engage in technological innovation, and successfully experimented with leakage tools, increasing efficiency by more than three times. The corner ring platform created by worker Guo Jilin not only improved work efficiency but also greatly improved working conditions. Everyone happily said: In the past, two people worked like pushing a mill all day long, without moving from their place, and had to walk one or twenty miles a day. Now, they can go with just one foot. On the basis of continuously solving ideological problems, our workshop developed from small-scale to large-scale work, from a few people working to everyone participating in a vigorous situation. The vast majority of workers ate at the factory and lived in the workshop, and some stayed up all night, and the leaders could not drive them away. They said: Hard work now is for future happiness. Therefore, everyone called "hard work" "happy work." They said: In order to achieve mechanization, they are not afraid of any difficulty.

	Long-Term Planning, Short-Term Arrangements, Implementation at All Levels

After the masses were mobilized, in order to give the masses a clear direction of combat and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, we formulated a technological transformation plan and put forward specific combat goals, which are:

	All staff and workers mobilize, take advantage of the victory to advance happily,
	Manual labor is mechanized, automatic production is realized early;
	Three-year plan completed in one year, production capacity doubled,
	Working conditions greatly improved, workshop appearance greatly changed.

At the same time, we also carried out activities such as competitions, challenges, and so on. We organized workers to calculate detailed accounts and set measures, thus quickly setting off a wave of planning at all levels and everyone offering good ideas. Calculating detailed accounts and setting measures is actually a process of concentrating mass wisdom, tapping potential, pooling collective wisdom, and vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. It is also a process of implementing item by item among the masses, greatly encouraging the morale of the workers. In just ten days of setting measures, 152 technological innovation projects were proposed. For example, processing bakelite cylinders is the weakest link in our workshop, and it has been manual operation for several years. Every month, we have to mobilize and focus on bakelite cylinders. Therefore, in our plan, we listed it as the first batch of targets to attack. After changing to circular saw processing, the daily output of processing bakelite cylinders jumped from 1,500 pieces to 20,000 pieces, increasing production efficiency by more than twelve times. In addition, we also solved the key to the processing of more than 20 kinds of bakelite cylinders.

Then, we concentrated our superior forces to focus on producing a large bushing product. Due to the tight time and urgent need, the manpower and equipment to complete this task were insufficient. What to do? All the workers in the workshop unanimously stated that they would solve their own difficulties and never be a hand-stretching faction. So we concentrated our forces, focused on breakthroughs, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, and soon changed the six processes of producing this batch of products to five processes, greatly improving production efficiency. As a result, without increasing manpower, we completed the production task ten days ahead of schedule.

These facts prove that having a long-term plan will make our direction clear, and grasping the current key points will also help ensure the realization of the long-term plan. That is to say, everyone should have the drive to reach the sky in one step, and also have measures to climb step by step.

	Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations

To realize, and to realize at high speed, the technological transformation plan, it is necessary to implement the principle of two participations, one reform, and three combinations, and vigorously carry out communist cooperation. For example, when reforming the 2.4-meter pipe rolling machine at the beginning of the year, some people said, "That is an imported product, and you can't break ground on the 'Taishui' head," but under the leadership and support of the Party branch, and with the Party branch secretary personally participating and reforming with us, and with the help of technicians, we used Sundays and Spring Festival holidays to rest, and after many experiments, we finally reformed it, saving five people, improving production efficiency by one time, and solving the key to insufficient equipment and operating area.

In realizing every innovation and creation, the comrades carried forward the communist style of "leaving difficulties to themselves and making convenience for others." Some people took the initiative to help others with technological innovation, and some people installed and used their own parts first for others. Their slogan is: Go up when you see difficulties, give up when you see honor, learn when you see advanced, and help when you see backward. It is precisely because of this that we have realized the technological transformation plan of our workshop ahead of schedule, greatly improved production efficiency, and adapted to the requirements of the great leap forward. After the workers were liberated from heavy manual labor, they wrote poems praising:

	In the past, I used a hand pad to string, and my waist and legs were sore from exhaustion.
	Sisters never dreamed that now the machine is automatically strung.
	Manual operation for ten years, this time it will never return.
	Thanks to the good leadership of the Party, the kindness of Chairman Mao cannot be expressed.

In short, of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first; of all the thousands of plans, the mass line is the first plan. With the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, even the greatest difficulties must surrender to us. Only if we resolutely listen to the Party's words and act according to the Party's instructions will we be invincible and invincible. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve all victories.

The achievements we have made are far from the requirements of the Party. We must not be arrogant or impetuous, and we must work resolutely and even more excellently in the direction pointed out by the Party. In order to welcome Red May, our factory Party committee proposed:

	Fight a big battle in April, double the mechanization indicators,
	Complete the task three days ahead of schedule, create miracles and offer gifts!

In April, we will realize 40 more assembly lines, 50 single-machine automatic and semi-automatic, completely eliminate heavy manual labor, and save about 15% of manpower, to present a gift to "May Day."

In the future, we are determined to study Chairman Mao's works more systematically and earnestly, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and always charge into battle for the revolution. Wherever the Party points, we will work there, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advancing bravely under the brilliant light of the Party's general line! (Attached picture)

专栏：

    大闹“四化”高产再高产
    王凤恩代表谈沈阳变压器厂  技术革新群众运动的体会各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。两位副总理的报告，展现出一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的图画，给我们以极大的鼓舞和力量。我坚决在今后的工作中认真贯彻执行。
    去年是我国社会主义建设在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续大跃进的一年。我们沈阳变压器厂也和全国各地一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在省、市委的直接领导下，全体职工解放思想，破除迷信，继续发扬了敢想敢干、虚心学习和大胆创造的精神，每个职工，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，广泛地深入地开展了声势浩大波澜壮阔的以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。学习并运用了鞍钢技术表演和佳木斯工业生产运动会的经验，出现了一个人人表演，处处表演，交流经验，学习经验的热潮。职工的劳动热情空前高涨，生产效率成倍、成十倍和成百倍的提高。全厂在不增人不增设备的情况下，在产量比1958年翻一番的基础上，提前四十一天超额完成了国家计划。广大职工群众，不仅干劲冲天，还发扬了工人阶级的敢想敢干的共产主义风格，技术革新层出不穷。去年一年，我们厂共实现了五千六百一十多项技术革新建议，制造土洋设备七十一台，全厂的机械化程度由去年初的38％，提高到71.4％，试制成功了三十七种新产品。去年我们生产的一台巨型变压器的容量，就等于旧中国一年生产容量的总和。这些成就的取得，是党的总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们车间，在党委的具体领导下，经过一年的努力，取得的成就也是很大的。去年全车间共提出三百项技术革新项目，实现了二百多项。自己制造土设备二十三台，主要工卡具五十余种。经过广大职工对原来的设备进行系列的改革和新的创造，使我们车间的生产面貌大为改观，机械化的程度由原来的30％提高到80％，把一百零五名工人从笨重的手工操作中解放出来，使车间的生产能力翻了两番，改变了过去全厂的薄弱环节，还抽出三十五名工人支援兄弟单位，提前七十天完成全年生产任务，成为全厂的先进车间。这一成就是怎么取得来的呢？我们的体会是：
      解决思想问题，大搞群众运动
    随着各个战线上的不断大跃进的形势，党和国家要求我们做出更多更大更好的变压器，而我们车间的生产量确远远不能适应大跃进的需要。按我们当时的能力只能完成三十到四十万千伏安，但厂要求每月要干八十万、九十万、甚至一百一十万的任务。不增人，不增设备，还要超额地完成任务，怎么解决这个矛盾呢？有两种思想两种做法：一种是少数人向厂伸手要人，要设备，认为技术革新是“远水不解近渴”。与此相反的是大多数人则主张自力更生，群策群力，大闹技术革命。车间党支部就抓住了这两种思想，召开职工大会，进行了大辩论，经过辩论和组织先进生产者、老工人座谈会，参观、交流经验，反复的进行了思想发动，广大职工干劲冲天，日夜奋战。就连过去很少搞创造的孙静茹也早来晚走的搞技术革新，试验成功了漏股工具，提高效率三倍多。工人郭吉林搞成的角环平台，不仅提高了工效，还大大的改善了劳动条件。大家高兴的说：过去两个人整天像推磨似的，一天不动地方，就得转转一、二十里路，现在脚一踩就走了。在不断解决思想的基础上，我们车间由小干到大干，由几个人干，到大家动手的蓬勃的局面。绝大多数工人，吃在工厂，住在车间，有的通宵夜战，领导上撵也不走。他们说：现在辛苦是为了将来的幸福，因此，大家管“苦战”叫“福战”。他们说：为了实现机械化、天大的困难也不怕。
      长规划，短安排，层层落实
    群众发动起来以后，为了使群众有明确的战斗方向和调动广大职工的积极性和创造性，我们制订了技术改造规划，提出了具体的战斗目标，这就是：
    全体职工总动员，乘胜猛进干的欢，
    手工劳动机械化，自动生产早实现；
    三年规划一年完，生产能力翻一番，
    劳动条件大改善，车间面貌大改观。
    同时，还开展了比武叫劲、挑应战等活动。组织职工算细账，订措施，从而很快的掀起了一个层层订计划，人人献妙计的热潮。算细账，订措施，实际上是集中群众智慧，大挖潜力，群策群力，大搞技术革新和技术革命的过程，也是在群众中逐项落实的过程，大大地鼓舞了职工的士气。仅在订措施的十天当中，就提出一百五十二项技术革新项目。如加工电木筒，是我们车间最薄弱的一个环节，几年来一直是手工操作，每当月末就得总动员，重点突击电木筒。所以，我们在规划中，把它列为首批攻打对象。经过改为轮锯加工以后，加工电木筒的日产量由一千五百件一跃提高到二万件，提高生产效率十二倍以上。此外还解决了二十余种电木筒加工的关键。
    接着，我们又集中优势兵力，突击生产一种大型套管产品。由于时间紧，要的急，完成这个任务的人手和设备都感不足。怎么办？全车间职工一致表示，有困难自己解决，决不当伸手派。于是我们就集中兵力，重点突击，大搞技术革新和技术革命，很快的就将生产这批产品的六道工序改为五道工序，大大地提高了生产效率，结果在不增加人的情况下，还提前十天完成了生产任务。
    这些事实证明，有了长远规划会使我们的方向明确，抓住了当前的重点又有利于保证长远规划的实现。也就是说，每个人都应该具有一步登天的干劲，又要有步步登高的措施。
        二参、一改、三结合
    要实现，而且要高速度的实现技术改造规划，就必须贯彻二参一改三结合的方针，大搞共产主义协作。例如，年初改革二米四卷管机时，有人说，“那是进口货，不能在‘太岁’头上动土”，但我们在党支部的领导和支持下，并由支部书记亲自参加，和我们一块进行改革，并在技术人员的帮助下，利用星期天和春节假日不休息，经过多次试验，终于把它改成了，节约了五个人，提高生产效率一倍，解决了设备和作业面积不足的关键。
    在实现每一项革新创造当中，同志们都发扬了“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的共产主义风格。有的人主动的帮助别人搞技术革新，有的人把自己搞成的零件，先给别人安装使用。他们的口号是：见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。也正是由于这样，才提前实现了我们车间的技术改造规划，大大地提高了生产效率，适应了大跃进的要求。工人们在工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来以后，写诗赞扬说：
    从前垫块手来串，累的腰疼腿又酸，
    姐妹作梦没想到，如今机械自动串，
    手工操作十年整，这回一去不复返，
    多亏党的好领导，毛主席的恩情说不完。
    总之，千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千计万计，群众路线是第一计。有了党的领导，有了群众的支持，就是天大的困难也得向我们缴枪投降。只有我们坚决听党的话，按党的指示办事，就会是攻无不克，战无不胜。党的领导是我们取得一切胜利的根本保证。
    我们所取得的成绩，与党的要求还差的很远。我们一定要不骄不傲，按着党指出的方向，坚决地干，而且干的更加出色。为了迎接红五月，我们厂党委提出：
    大战4月份，机械化指标翻番，
    任务提前三天完，创造奇迹把礼献！
    在4月份，我们再实现四十条流水线，五十台单机自动和半自动、全部消灭笨重的体力劳动，再节约人力15％左右，向“五一”献礼。
    今后，我们决心更系统地、认真地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，永远为革命冲锋陷阵，党指向哪里，我们就干到哪里，高举毛泽东思想红旗，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，奋勇前进！（附图片）
