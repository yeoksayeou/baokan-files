This newspaper reports: Shanxi Province is undertaking a major innovation in corn planting technology this year: corn ridge-furrow cultivation. The province's 3.5 million mu of high-yield corn plots have basically been converted to furrow fields. Currently, various localities are leveling furrows, transporting topsoil fertilizer, and actively preparing for sowing, with some areas already starting to sow.

Shanxi is one of the major corn producing areas in the country, with a large planting area and good varieties. The broad masses of farmers have always had experience in growing corn, and since the Great Leap Forward, corn planting techniques have seen new improvements. Corn ridge-furrow cultivation is an advanced cultivation method summarized from mass experimentation. According to the rural trials and promotion in the Jin Southeast District, as well as the summary and appraisal of agricultural scientific research departments, planting corn in furrow fields has eight major advantages compared to general cultivation methods: First, general furrow fields can be deep-plowed to about one foot, adapting to the characteristics of corn plants being tall and having developed root systems, requiring deep soil layers for growth; Second, applying fertilizer to different tillage layers can truly achieve the purpose of layered fertilization, ensuring that corn has sufficient nutrients in each growth stage; Third, furrow field irrigation is very convenient, which can save water consumption, and at the same time, the moisture retention capacity is also strong; Fourth, high-density planting can be implemented, and the number of plants per mu can be increased from about 2,000 in the past to more than 2,500; Fifth, it is easy to accumulate snow and retain moisture in winter, and it can control soil erosion during the rainy season, especially in sloping land, the effect is more significant; Sixth, because the furrow fields have ridges and furrows, it is convenient for middle cultivation, earthing up, topdressing, and watering, which solves the contradiction of inconvenient management after dense planting; Seventh, turning the deep soil to the ridge backs can freeze to death the deep grass roots and insect eggs and pupae in winter; Eighth, the row spacing of furrow fields is large, which is more conducive to intercropping and relay planting, improving land utilization. Therefore, under the same cultivation conditions, furrow fields can increase production by 20% to 50% compared to ordinary fields.

Corn ridge-furrow cultivation is a major reform in cultivation technology by Shanxi farmers. This technical reform was successfully tested by the Gaoke Village Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Changzhi City in 1956 under the proposal of veteran farmer Li Yubao. Since then, various localities have widely set up experimental sites, and large-scale promotion began in 1958. Last year, corn planted in furrow ridges in various places accounted for one-seventh of the total corn area in the province. Years of practice have proved that corn ridge-furrow cultivation technology has a wide range of adaptability, and it can be promoted in plains, high terraces, paddy fields, and drylands. It is the best form of cultivation gardenization for planting corn. Party committees and leading organs at all levels have vigorously promoted this experience.

    山西推广玉米渠田垅作
    在同等耕作条件下渠田比一般田增产20％至50％
    本报讯　山西省今年在玉米种植技术上进行着一项重大革新——玉米渠田垅作。全省三百五十万亩丰产方玉米，已基本实现渠田化。目前各地正在平整渠沟、积送表层肥料，积极进行播种准备，有的地方已经开始播种。
    山西是全国玉米主要产地之一，播种面积大而且品种好。广大农民一向有种植玉米的经验，大跃进以来种植玉米的技术有了新的提高。玉米渠田垅作是群众试验总结出来的一种先进的耕作方法。根据晋东南专区农村试验、推广的情况，以及农业科学研究部门的总结鉴定，渠田种植玉米比一般栽培法有八大好处：第一、一般渠田可深翻一尺左右，适应玉米植株高大、根系发达，需要深厚土层生长的特点；第二、把肥料施到不同的耕作层里，可以真正达到分层施肥的目的，保证玉米在各个生长期，都有充足的养分；第三、渠田灌溉十分方便，可以节约用水量，同时保墒能力也较强；第四、可实行高度密植，亩植株数可由过去二千株右右提高到二千五百株以上；第五、在冬季便于积雪保墒，在雨季可控制水土流失，特别是在坡地作用更为显著；第六、由于渠田有背有沟，便于中耕、培土、追肥、浇水，解决了密植后不便管理的矛盾；第七、把深土翻到垅背上，冬季可以将深层的草根、害虫卵蛹冻死；第八、渠田行距大，更利于间作、套种，提高土地利用率。因此，在同等耕作条件下，渠田比一般田要增产20％到50％。
    玉米渠田垅作，是山西农民在栽培技术上的一项重大改革。这项技术改革是1956年由长治市高河村高级农业社在老农李玉保提议下试验成功的。此后，各地广泛布点试验，1958年开始大面积推广，去年各地渠田垅作的玉米已占到全省玉米总面积的七分之一。几年来的实践证明，玉米渠田垅作技术，适应范围很广，平地、高垣地、水地、旱地都可以推广。它是种植玉米实现耕作园田化的最好形式，各级党委和领导机关都大力推广这一经验。
