    Diligently Cultivating the Seedlings of Communism
    ——The “Love Diary” of Teachers at Yaoshao Elementary School
    By our reporter Chen Wanwen
      “Tan Wosheng hit a classmate again for no reason. The classmate complained about him, and said that today he took a piece of pencil from someone else. I called him in to ask about it, but he ran away.” This is a passage written by Ye Guijun, a young female teacher in Class A of the first grade at Yaoshao Elementary School in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, in her “Love Diary.”
    Tan Wosheng's schoolwork is not good. He didn't pass this semester and is still in the first grade, newly assigned to Ye Guijun’s class. After Ye Guijun became his class teacher, she discovered that Tan Wosheng was indeed very naughty: whether in class, morning exercises, or games, he always liked to pull this one and tug that one. The children secretly called him "Little Overlord." If anything was lost in the class, it was usually taken by him. When the teacher asked him, he always ignored them. Ye Guijun carefully wrote down these observations in her "Love Diary." Every time she wrote it, she felt a touch in her heart: the child is young and has a poor ability to distinguish right from wrong. If he does something wrong, he may not even know it himself. But how should she help him overcome his shortcomings? Ye Guijun went to consult Tan Wosheng's previous class teacher. Although this class teacher had also made several home visits, hoping to educate Tan Wosheng well with the cooperation of his parents, it did not achieve its goal. What was going on?
    Ye Guijun was inspired by other teachers and decided to conduct another home visit. After returning, she wrote in her "Love Diary": "His parents are very strict with him. After the teacher told them about his situation last semester, his father beat him every time they were told. He is the youngest among his brothers, and his brothers also look down on him and often beat him." Ye Guijun knew that in the past, because they had not helped parents and teachers to take consistent methods to educate children, home visits not only did not achieve the corresponding effect, but instead added new burdens to the children's physical and mental health. This time, she first advised Tan Wosheng's parents to correct their attitude and methods of educating children, and also asked them to persuade the older children not to bully Tan Wosheng.
    After this home visit, Tan Wosheng's father did not scold him, which was beyond Tan Wosheng's expectation. Since then, he has been more willing to approach the teacher. Taking advantage of this opportunity, one day, Ye Guijun asked Tan Wosheng: "Do your brothers still beat you?" He said: "No." Teacher Ye then educated him: Your brothers beat you, making you unhappy; then, if you hit your classmates, your classmates will also be unhappy. She knew that Tan Wosheng loved to work. Others only picked up six or seven liang of grain each time, but he picked up more than twenty liang. She remembered the words of the Soviet educator Makarenko: "For every undisciplined child... one should see those latent but prominent advantages." She praised him in the class for his good labor, changing the students' impression of him. Tan Wosheng was respected by his classmates and slowly stopped fighting.
    However, Tan Wosheng's habit of taking other people's small things has not been corrected. What should be done? Ye Guijun finally waited for such an opportunity: One day, Tan Wosheng ran to tell the teacher angrily that a few sweet potatoes had been dug out from the patch of sweet potatoes he and his grandmother had worked so hard to plant. Teacher Ye said, "You said that person was bad for digging sweet potatoes. Is it okay if someone in our class takes other people's small things?" Tan Wosheng blushed and admitted that it was not good. Teacher Ye knew that Tan Wosheng loved Chairman Mao and often picked up books with Chairman Mao's portrait and looked at them carefully. She further educated him: Listening to the teacher's guidance will surely make you a good student of Chairman Mao. Soon, in Teacher Ye's "Love Diary," these words appeared again: "Tan Wosheng has changed, and today he has become a glorious Young Pioneer." The red scarf on Tan Wosheng's neck was also given to him by Teacher Ye with excitement.
    Filling out the "Love Diary" is a new measure set by the teachers of Yaoshao Elementary School in order to correctly implement the education policy. This is a record of the students' political and ideological education life. In the past, the teachers of Yaoshao Elementary School had more or less such shortcomings: they only cared about teaching books and did not care about educating people; or they cared about both, but they did not pay attention to methods and methods suitable for children's characteristics, so the children were still undisciplined and liked to fight... After the All-People Rectification Movement, and after repeatedly studying the education policy and being inspired in practice, the teachers deeply realized that: Politics is the commander, and only by strengthening political and ideological education for students, and unifying ideological education and education work, and carrying out effective education work according to the characteristics of children's education, can we cultivate comprehensively developed new people.
   "Love Diary" is the product of this educational thought. Since the implementation of this measure, moving examples like Ye Guijun, who loved children and patiently and meticulously guided and educated children according to their characteristics, can be seen in almost every "Love Diary." Tan Dexin, the class teacher of Class A in the third grade, wrote in the "Love Diary": "Recently, Tan Shidong's desk is full of odds and ends. He takes them out to play as soon as class starts, and doesn't concentrate on listening to the class. His self-esteem is very strong, and he must inspire his self-awareness." One day after class, Teacher Tan saw Tan Shidong playing with iron nails alone in the classroom. He walked into the classroom and said, "Shidong, the podium in our classroom is broken. Can you help me nail it?" Tan Shidong quickly agreed. The teacher asked him what to do if he didn't have any nails? Without thinking, he took out the nails he was playing with and repaired the podium with the teacher. The next day, the teacher wrote a big-character poster to commend him, saying that he had done a good deed for the collective. Then, he educated him to keep the sundries hidden when he was in class, and only take them out when they were useful, otherwise it would affect classroom order. Without hurting Tan Shidong's self-esteem, he was very willing to agree to the teacher's request. Under the patient guidance of this teacher, all the students in the class actively studied, and they all achieved excellent results last semester.
    From the "Love Diary," we also see that the teachers of this elementary school paid such moving labor for the sake of educating the new generation well. Before school started, the class teachers of the first grade had jointly discussed a plan on how to educate children who were entering school for the first time. They visited kindergarten teachers during the summer vacation to understand the situation of children who were about to enter elementary school. When they learned that the children's hygiene habits were not well developed, they decorated the classroom neatly and beautifully on the first day of school, and then took the students to visit and encouraged them to maintain cleanliness in the future. The plans they had written in the "Love Diary," preparing to educate students to learn "Comrade Xiang Xiuli's noble communist qualities," "Respecting the old and loving the young," and "Doing good deeds for the commune members," have all been realized. These activities have had a profound impact on the young minds of the students. Good deeds such as rescuing children in the water, jumping into the fish pond to block the gap in the dark of a thunderstorm, tutoring classmates who have asked for sick leave, and helping old ladies cross the bridge, are constantly emerging among the students of Yaoshao Elementary School. The children here are all happy and healthy, love labor, study hard, and the young buds of communist thought are growing in the hearts of the children day by day.

    辛勤培植共产主义的幼苗
    ——雅韶小学教师的“爱生日记”
    本报记者　陈婉雯
      “谭沃生又无缘无故的打了同学，同学来告了他一状，并且说他今天又拿了别人的一截铅笔。我找他来问，他跑掉了。”这是广东省两阳县雅韶小学一年级甲班青年女教师叶桂钧在“爱生日记”上写下的一段话。
    谭沃生的功课很不好，这学期没有升级，仍然留在一年级，新编到叶桂钧这班里来。叶桂钧当了他的班主任以后，她发现谭沃生的确很顽皮：不论在上课、早操或是游戏，他总是爱拉这个一把，扯那个一下的。孩子们背地里叫他做“小霸王”。班里遗失了什么东西，通常都是他拿去的。老师问他，他总是不理不睬。叶桂钧把观察得来的这些情况，仔细地写在“爱生日记”上。每写一遍，她内心里总有些触动：孩子年纪小，分辨是非的能力差，做错了事，可能自己也不知道的。可是，应该怎样去帮助他克服缺点呢？叶桂钧就去请教谭沃生以前的班主任。这位班主任虽然也到谭沃生的家庭作过几次访问，希望在家长的合作下把谭沃生教好，但是没有达到目的。这又是怎么一回事呢？
    叶桂钧从其他教师中得到启发，决定再去进行一次家庭访问。回来后，她在“爱生日记”中写道：“他的父母对他要求很严格，上学期老师把他的情况告诉他们后，每说一次，父亲就打他一次。他在兄弟中是最小的，哥哥们也瞧不起他，常常打他。”叶桂钧知道过去由于没有帮助家长同教师采取一致的办法教育儿童，因此家庭访问不但没有收到相应的效果，相反，却使儿童的身心增加了新的负担。这次，她首先劝告谭沃生的父母，要端正管教儿童的态度和办法，而且要求他们规劝大孩子，不要欺侮谭沃生。
    这次家庭访问之后，谭沃生的父亲没有责打他，这是出乎谭沃生的意料之外的。从此，他就比较愿意和老师接近了。叶桂钧趁着这个机会，有一天，便问谭沃生：“哥哥们还打你吗？”他说：“不打了。”叶老师就教育他：哥哥们打你，使你不高兴；那末，你打小同学，小同学也会不高兴的。她知道谭沃生很爱劳动，别人每次拾谷粒，只有六、七两，而他拾的却超过二十两。她记起苏联教育家马卡连柯的话：“对每个不守纪律的儿童，……应该看到那些潜伏着的，但是突出的优点。”她便在班里表扬他劳动好，改变同学们对他的印象。谭沃生受到同学的尊重，慢慢地也不再打架了。
    但是，谭沃生拿别人小东西的习惯还没有改好，这又该怎样办呢？叶桂钧终于等到这么一个机会了：有一天，谭沃生气呼呼的跑来告诉老师说，他和祖母辛辛苦苦栽的一畦红薯，给人挖去了几条。叶老师说：“那人挖红薯，你说他不好，我们班也有人会拿别人一些小东西，你说他好吗？”谭沃生涨红了小脸，承认了那是不好的。叶老师知道谭沃生热爱毛主席，经常拿起印有毛主席像的书本细细端详。便又进一步教育他：听老师的教导，就一定会成为毛主席的好学生。不久，在叶老师的“爱生日记”上，又出现这样的话：“谭沃生转变了，他今天已经成为光荣的少先队员”。谭沃生脖子上的红领巾，也是叶老师怀着激动的心情送给他的。
    填写“爱生日记”，是雅韶小学教师们为了正确贯彻教育方针而定出来的一个新措施。这是一个对学生进行政治思想教育生活的记录。过去，雅韶小学教师们或多或少存在这样的缺点：只管教书，不管教人；或是两者都管了，而又不讲求适合儿童特点的方式方法，结果儿童们还是不守纪律，爱打架，……教师们经过全民整风运动，以及在反复学习教育方针和在实践中得到启发之后，深刻地体会到：政治是统帅，只有对学生加强政治思想教育，并且把思想教育和教育工作统一起来，根据儿童教育的特点，进行有效的教育工作，才能培养出全面发展的新人。
   “爱生日记”就是这个教育思想的产物。执行这个措施以来，像叶桂钧那样热爱儿童，根据儿童特点进行耐心细致的诱导教育儿童的动人事例，几乎在每本“爱生日记”中都可以看到的。三年级甲班班主任谭德信在“爱生日记”上就这样写着：“最近，谭仕东的桌子里放满了零星东西，一上课便拿出来玩，不专心听课。他的自尊心十分强，必须启发他的自觉性。”有一天下课后，谭老师窥见了谭仕东独个儿在课室玩铁钉。他走进课室说：“仕东，我们课室的讲台坏了，你能帮助我把它钉好吗？”谭仕东很快的答应了。老师又问他没有钉子怎么办？他不加思索地把自己正玩着的钉子拿出来，和老师一块修理讲台。第二天，老师写大字报表扬了他，说他为集体做了好事。接着，又教育他上课时要把杂物收藏好，到有用时才拿出来用，不然就会影响课堂秩序了。在毫不伤害谭仕东自尊心的情况下，他非常乐意地答应了老师的要求。在这位教师的循循善诱下，全班学生都积极学习，上学期他们全班都获得优良成绩。
    从“爱生日记”中，我们还看到，这个小学的教师们，为着教育好新的一代。她们支付了多么动人的劳动，还没有开学，一年级的几个班主任教师已经共同讨论了如何对初入学儿童进行教育的计划了。他们在暑假中去访问了幼儿园的保育员，了解将要升小学的儿童的情况。当她们知道儿童的清洁卫生习惯还没有很好地养成的时候，便在开学的那一天，把课堂布置得整齐、美观，然后带学生们参观，勉励他们以后要保持清洁。她们曾经写在“爱生日记”上的，准备教育学生学习“向秀丽姐姐共产主义高贵品质”、“敬老爱幼”、“为社员做好事”的计划，都得到实现了。这些活动，在学生幼小的心灵里，产生了深远的影响。在水中抢救小孩，冒着雷雨的黑夜跳下鱼塘堵塞缺口，给请了病假的同学补课，搀扶老太太过桥等等好人好事，不断在雅韶小学的学生中涌现。这里的儿童们，都身心愉快，热爱劳动，勤奋学习，共产主义思想的幼芽在孩子们的心中一天天成长起来了。
