Indecent Interference
	Zhang Ye

	The struggle between the United States' interference in the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban people's opposition to American interference is intensifying. This struggle is expanding into a broader conflict between the United States' intensified efforts to "mend the Pan-American system," suppress Latin American national democratic movements, and the Latin American countries' efforts to defend national independence, strive for democratic freedom, and oppose American enslavement, control, and plunder. It centrally reflects the tremendous and profound historical changes that Latin America is undergoing in the current new world situation.

The Record of Indecent Interferences

	Eisenhower, during his recent trip to South America, proclaimed everywhere that the United States "decently and consistently adheres to a policy of non-interference." But contrary to this lie, the United States' fierce interference in the Cuban Revolution has run through every stage of the Cuban Revolution's development. One conspiracy fails, and another new conspiracy is launched. Political and economic interference, along with constant planning of military interference, constitutes the most indecent record in the countless criminal acts of the United States in interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries for more than a century.

	During the period of the Cuban people's armed struggle against the dictatorship, the United States tried to extinguish the flames of revolution. Initially, the United States helped the Batista dictatorship suppress the then-weak popular uprising by various means, from training troops and supplying weapons to directly commanding the reactionary army in combat. When the insurgent army grew stronger and the situation became unfavorable to Batista, the United States not only continued to provide the dictatorial government with large quantities of weapons through the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and the American troops stationed at the base in Cuba, but also brazenly dispatched aircraft to cooperate in combat and even sent Marines to land in Cuba to save the tottering dictatorial regime. Even when the Cuban Revolution was approaching victory, the United States used despicable means to plan a sham election and organize a "three-person military committee" in Cuba in an attempt to prevent the insurgents from seizing power.

	After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the U.S. imperialism, unwilling to accept defeat, wanted to nip the new Cuban regime in the bud. Many progressive anti-imperialist and anti-feudal measures taken by Cuba, such as suppressing war criminals, implementing land reform, restricting foreign capital, and developing the national economy, aroused the hatred and interference of the United States. The United States also openly sheltered fleeing rebels, such as former Cuban Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz and former Camagüey Province Forces Commander Matos, and organized them to carry out sabotage and restoration conspiracies. The United States not only opposed Cuba's land reform, but also openly declared that it would "protect" the "legitimate rights" of American monopoly capital in Cuba. At the same time, the United States repeatedly instigated the "Organization of American States" to attack Cuba, creating the so-called Cuban "invasion" incident, and convened meetings of foreign ministers of the Americas in an attempt to organize armed intervention against Cuba and repeat the Guatemalan incident.

	Recently, the United States' interference in Cuba has intensified, employing both soft and hard tactics, leaving no stone unturned. It has exploited Cuba's vulnerability as its main income relies on sugar exports and the United States is Cuba's main sugar market, constantly threatening to reduce the quota of sugar the US imports from Cuba. Recently, it has submitted a bill to Congress authorizing the president to amend the sugar import quota at any time, in an attempt to force Cuba to yield. At the same time, the United States has been constantly holding military exercises in the Caribbean Sea and organizing mercenary forces to attack Cuba in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, and other places. Airplanes taking off from American bases have carried out dozens of bombings and arson attacks on Cuban sugarcane fields. The United States has also created the "La Coubre" ship explosion tragedy to prevent Cuba from purchasing weapons. The conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" for armed intervention is also continuing. Eisenhower's visit to South America was an attempt to pave the way for isolating and interfering with Cuba. Rubottom, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, openly advocated taking "collective security measures to oppose any form of aggression" based on the 1954 "Caracas Declaration" that was used to subvert the democratic government of Guatemala.

	For more than a year, the United States has used almost every means of interference, except for launching a large-scale armed attack. It is only because Cuba has resolutely opposed American interference in all aspects, pushed the revolution forward, and continuously consolidated and strengthened its national democratic forces, while also gaining the strong support of the people of Latin America and the people of the world, that the United States' interventionist conspiracies have so far failed to succeed.

A Series of Shameful Disguises and Excuses

	U.S. imperialism has sought all kinds of disguises and excuses for its hostile and interventionist plots against the Cuban Revolution, but none of them can conceal the real reason why it so ferociously interferes with the Cuban Revolution, determined to strangle it to death.

	Until recently, U.S. Secretary of State Herter shamelessly said that the United States deeply sympathized with the goals of the Cuban Revolution. However, when the United States' all-out efforts to save the Batista dictatorship failed and it had to recognize the Cuban revolutionary regime, the U.S. State Department publicly issued a statement, "hoping to see a free and democratic system in Cuba." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom even more bluntly demanded that Cuba "consider American public opinion" so that "the Cuban people can satisfy their desire for freedom and justice." This clearly shows that the government established after the Cuban Revolution, which is supported by the people of the whole country, is not to the taste of the United States. The United States arrogantly demands that the Cuban people, who have won the revolution, continue to obey Washington's dictates and succumb to the will of American capital. However, the heroic Cuban people not only treated this "public opinion" with contempt, but also continued to advance towards the revolutionary goals that the United States opposed. They destroyed the old state apparatus and military machine, established a new national democratic regime and revolutionary armed forces; they suppressed the remnants of the Batista forces and rebels, expanded democratic freedoms, and mobilized patriotic democratic forces; they implemented land reform, developed diversified agricultural operations, and strived to achieve industrialization; they pursued an independent foreign policy and developed foreign trade in line with national interests. What particularly disturbed and dissatisfied Washington was that the Cuban government requisitioned land occupied by American companies, abolished all concessions of American companies, and began to recover underground oil resources, constantly shaking the foundations of American monopoly capital's plunder of the Cuban people.

	As a result, the American interventionists were furious and revealed their true colors. Eisenhower himself came forward, clamoring that there was an "international communist conspiracy" in Cuba, attacking Cuba for "abolishing, disrupting, and changing" the "traditional economic relations" between the United States and Cuba, and openly threatened that the United States "will continue to exercise their own sovereignty to maintain and defend their legitimate interests." Anti-communism is a long-worn and tattered guise. Hostility towards the Cuban Revolution and attempts to maintain the plunder and control of American capital over Cuba are the true ambitions of the United States. As Cuban President Dorticós pointed out, Eisenhower's slander of an "international communist conspiracy" is because "Cuba has found its own political, economic, social, and cultural expressions." Castro also pointed out that the reason why the United States wants to rudely interfere in Cuba's internal affairs is that Cuba's land reform has violated the interests of foreign companies. Therefore, they are trying to make Cuba return to its past dark state in order to re-establish a system of enslavement on Cuban soil. This all hits the nail on the head, revealing the truth: U.S. imperialism cannot tolerate Cuba breaking away from its semi-feudal, semi-colonial status of political and economic dependence on the United States, and seeking genuine independence and autonomy.

	The U.S. government has repeatedly sent notes to the Cuban government, actually demanding that the Cuban government, according to the laws of the Batista traitorous dictatorial regime and so-called international law, allow American companies' investments and "work" in Cuba to "continue on a mutually satisfactory basis," or immediately compensate the expropriated American industries with cash at the highest price in advance. Obviously, the United States is trying to prevent Cuba from recovering and expropriating land and resources occupied by American companies, so that American companies can continue to plunder and control Cuba. In the eyes of the United States, the Cuban government has no right to abolish the laws of the traitorous regime, no right to promulgate and implement laws on land reform and expropriation of land from American large estates, and no right to abolish American companies' concessions on oil and mining. This is nothing but imperialist robber logic. As for the Cuban government's provision, in accordance with the Constitution and its own financial conditions, to compensate for the expropriated land in the form of bonds (paying 4.5% interest) within a period of twenty years, it is not a confiscation without compensation. This policy of redemption for American monopoly capital that has long exploited Cuba cannot be considered anything but very tolerant. The U.S. demand for immediate, upfront cash compensation at the highest price is completely a shameless blackmail. The Cuban government resolutely rejected these unreasonable demands of the U.S. government, firmly defended its sacred national sovereignty, and ensured the independent development of the national economy.

	It is precisely because of the United States' crude interference that Cuban-American relations have become increasingly strained. However, the U.S. government has ulterior motives in shifting the blame onto Cuba, hyping up the just struggle of Cuba in maintaining its sovereignty and opposing interference, creating "continuous deterioration" in Cuban-American relations.

	Therefore, the reason why the United States is hostile to and interferes in the Cuban Revolution is not only to so-called "defend" the "legitimate rights" of American capital in Cuba, but also to undermine Cuba's national democratic revolution, so that Cuba can continue to depend on the United States, become a market for the United States to supply raw materials and dump commodities, and become a military base in the American "Pan-American system."

Another Pirate Flag - "Modern Monroe Doctrine"

	The more important purpose of the United States in strangling the Cuban Revolution is to extinguish the tremendous and far-reaching impact of the Cuban Revolution on the entire Latin American national democratic movement, in order to maintain American control and plunder of Latin America.

	The victory of the Cuban people is one of the most significant victories in the vigorously developing Latin American national democratic movement in recent years. It centrally reflects the intensification of contradictions and conflicts between Latin America and U.S. imperialism and its agents. Therefore, the victory, consolidation, and development of the Cuban Revolution has become a clear banner for the Latin American countries in striving for independent development and the people's democratic movement, and a milestone for Latin America in moving from the national independence revolution of a century and a half ago to a new national democratic revolution. Lombardo Toledano, president of the Latin American Labor Confederation, recently pointed out that the Cuban Revolution has opened the era of the second great liberation revolution in the Americas. It declares the beginning of a series of revolutions that will take place in Latin America. Whether or not American monopoly organizations are willing, Latin America will change its semi-colonial structure and eliminate its dependent status.

	The Cuban Revolution is the first revolution in Latin America to achieve victory through armed struggle. The overthrown Batista dictatorial regime possessed a powerful army trained and armed by the United States for a long time, and Cuba is a small country only ninety nautical miles away from the United States, the so-called "American doorstep." The United States used its tens of thousands of troops stationed at its base in Cuba and its short geographical distance from Cuba to directly and indirectly support the dictatorial government in suppressing the people's uprising. U.S. imperialism has tried its best to spread fallacies such as "geographical determinism," the invincible power of professional armies, and the invincibility of the United States, attempting to prove that it is impossible for the people of Latin American countries to achieve the victory of the national democratic revolution. However, the armed forces supported by the Cuban people grew from small to large, from weak to strong, and finally overthrew the U.S.-backed, armed-to-the-teeth dictatorial government, shattering the fallacies of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the victory of the Cuban Revolution has greatly encouraged and promoted the struggle of the Latin American people for complete independence and democratic freedom. First of all, the people of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Paraguay, the few remaining dictatorial countries, have risen up and followed the example of the Cuban people, launching armed struggles. The people's movements in Panama, Puerto Rico, and other countries have also developed more vigorously. The situation in the Caribbean region has since undergone tremendous changes, and anti-American waves have swept across Latin America.

	Secondly, the revolutionary victory of the Cuban people is different from the incomplete revolutions in which the Latin American people overthrew ten dictatorial regimes in the past, or the unstable democratic revolution in Guatemala in 1954. After overthrowing the dictatorial regime of American agents, the Cuban people are not limited to changing the form of rule. The new regime is also built on a more solid foundation of broader unity and deeper development of the revolution, and therefore can withstand American interference and subversion conspiracies and defend the fruits of the revolution. The problems solved by the Cuban Revolution – resolutely breaking away from the control of U.S. imperialism, abolishing semi-feudal land relations, safeguarding national independence and sovereignty, establishing a broad national democratic regime, and striving for the independent development of the national economy – are common problems faced by the national democratic revolutions of Latin American countries and the goals they strive to achieve. Therefore, the Cuban Revolution pointed out to the people of other Latin American countries a path to achieving the complete victory of the revolution. As pointed out at the recent Latin American Conference for Peace, the Cuban Revolution "realizes the aspirations of the people of Latin American countries for liberation and points out the path forward for them."

	Therefore, the Cuban Revolution cannot but have a profound impact on the profound development of the entire Latin American national democratic revolution.

	Finally, the fierce struggle of the Cuban people against American interference for more than a year has thoroughly exposed that U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the national democratic interests of Latin America, and at the same time is a sworn enemy that is not invincible. The Cuban people have been educated and tempered in the struggle, becoming increasingly strong, while the American interventionists have been continuously frustrated, becoming increasingly isolated and embarrassed. This has enabled the people of other Latin American countries to receive the same education and tempering from the struggle of the Cuban people, and to further realize that they must strengthen the unity of the national democratic forces and resolutely crush the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to strengthen control and suppression through various disguises and deceptions.

	Precisely because of this, U.S. imperialism is alarmed and uneasy about the victory and in-depth development of the Cuban Revolution, and regards extinguishing the flames of the Cuban Revolution as the central focus of "mending the backyard" and suppressing the entire Latin American national democratic movement. The United States' interventionist activities for more than a year and Eisenhower's recent trip to South America have proved this point. Following the notorious pirate flag he waved in the Middle East - the Eisenhower Doctrine - Eisenhower is now waving another pirate flag in Latin America - the "Modern Monroe Doctrine." Its content is: First, strengthen the "Pan-American System" and the "Pan-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" with the United States' deterrent power as the "anchor of security"; second, use the US dollar as bait, falsely claiming "Pan-American economic development and cooperation," but in fact, it further strengthens economic control; third, suppress the Latin American national democratic movement under the pretext of "opposing the spread of communism to any country on this continent"; fourth, organize another Guatemalan incident to interfere with the Cuban Revolution. However, at the same time, the movement of Latin American countries to defend the Cuban Revolution and support the Latin American revolution is also surging from one climax to a new climax. During Eisenhower's trip to South America, he was met everywhere by loud slogans from the masses of various countries calling for "Oppose interference in Cuba" and "Long live Cuba," and his situation was even more embarrassing than Nixon's being attacked by rotten eggs and tomatoes. Recently, the Latin American people, in the "Latin American Declaration" issued during the "Week of Support for the Latin American People," demanded an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, and called for strengthening unified support for the Cuban Revolution. This marks that the Latin American people's anti-American struggle has entered a new stage. The struggle of the Latin American people for national democratic revolution has also received the support of the powerful socialist camp and the people of all countries. The just banner they hold high - "Latin America is Latin America for the Latin American people" - will surely defeat the pirate flag of the American "Modern Monroe Doctrine." The era of the United States' unbridled rampage in Latin America is gone forever.

    不体面的干涉
    章叶
    美国干涉古巴革命和古巴人民反对美国干涉之间的斗争，日益尖锐化。这一场斗争，正在日益扩大地发展成为美国加紧“弥补泛美体系”，镇压拉丁美洲民族民主运动，以及拉丁美洲各国人民维护民族独立、争取民主自由，反对美国奴役、控制和掠夺之间的斗争。它集中地反映出了：在目前崭新的世界形势下，拉丁美洲正在经历着的巨大的深刻的历史变革。
    不体面的干涉者的记录
    艾森豪威尔最近在南美之行中，到处宣扬所谓美国“体面地、坚持不渝地奉行不干涉政策”。但与这个谎言相反，美国对古巴革命的凶恶干涉，贯穿在古巴革命的每一发展过程中。它的一个阴谋失败了，又进行另一个新的阴谋，政治、经济的干涉之外，还不断策划军事的干涉，构成了美国一个多世纪来干涉拉丁美洲各国内政的无数罪恶勾当中最不体面的记录。
    在古巴人民进行反独裁武装斗争时期，美国就力图扑灭革命的火焰。美国最初是采取从训练军队、供应军火，一直到直接指挥反动军队作战等各种方式，帮助巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，镇压当时处于劣势的人民起义运动。当起义军不断壮大，形势不利于巴蒂斯塔的时候，美国不仅通过多米尼加、尼加拉瓜和美国在古巴基地的驻军，继续给独裁政府提供大量武器，而且悍然出动飞机配合作战，并一度派海军陆战队在古巴登陆，挽救摇摇欲坠的独裁政权。直到古巴革命已经接近胜利，美国还使用了卑鄙手段，策划举行伪选，在古巴组织“三人军事委员会”，企图阻止起义军取得政权。
    古巴革命胜利后，不甘心于失败的美帝国主义，又想把古巴的新政权扼杀在摇篮中。古巴采取的许多反帝反封建的进步措施，如镇压战犯以及实行土地改革，限制外国资本，发展民族经济等等政治经济改革，无不引起美国的仇视和干预。美国还公然庇护逃亡的叛乱分子，如前古巴空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯、前卡马圭省部队司令马托斯之流，组织他们进行破坏和复辟阴谋。美国不仅反对古巴的土地改革，而且公然宣称要“保护”美国垄断资本在古巴的“合法权利”。与此同时，美国一再策动“美洲国家组织”攻击古巴，制造过所谓古巴“入侵”事件，召开美洲国家外长会议，企图组织对古巴的武装干涉，重演危地马拉事件。
    最近以来，美国对古巴的干涉活动，更为加紧，软硬兼施，无所不用其极。它利用古巴主要收入依靠输出食糖而美国是古巴食糖的主要市场的这个弱点，不断威胁着要削减美国从古巴进口食糖的定额。最近已将授权总统随时修改食糖进口定额的法案提交了国会，企图迫使古巴屈服。同时，美国不断在加勒比海举行军事演习，在多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯等地组织进攻古巴的雇佣军。从美国基地起飞的飞机对古巴甘蔗园进行了几十次的轰炸和燃烧。美国还制造“勒库布尔”号轮船爆炸惨案，阻止古巴购买军火。利用“美洲国家组织”进行武装干涉的阴谋，也在继续进行。艾森豪威尔访问南美时，就企图为孤立和干涉古巴铺平道路。美国美洲事务助理国务卿鲁博特姆公开鼓吹根据曾用以颠覆危地马拉民主政府的1954年“加拉加斯宣言”，采取“集体安全措施，来反对任何形式的侵略”。
    一年多来，美国除了还没有发动大规模的武装进攻之外，几乎一切干涉手段都用到了。只是由于古巴在各方面坚决反对美国干涉，把革命向前推进，不断地巩固和加强了民族民主力量，同时取得了拉丁美洲人民和世界人民的有力支持，使得美国的干涉阴谋至今不能得逞。
    一系列可耻的伪装和借口
    美帝国主义为它敌视和干涉古巴革命的勾当，寻找了各种各样的伪装和借口，但都丝毫不能掩饰它为什么这样穷凶极恶地干涉古巴革命，必欲扼杀之而后快的真实原因。
    直到最近，美国国务卿赫脱还厚颜无耻地说什么美国非常同情古巴革命的目标。可是，当美国全力挽救巴蒂斯塔独裁政权遭到失败，不得不承认古巴革命政权的时候，美国国务院就公开发表声明，“希望看到古巴有自由民主制度”。美国助理国务卿鲁博特姆甚至更露骨地要求古巴“考虑美国的舆论”，使“古巴人民有可能满足对自由和公正的愿望”。这就清楚地表明，古巴革命后建立的得到全国人民拥护的政府，不合美国的胃口。美国狂妄地要求取得了革命胜利的古巴人民继续听命于华盛顿的摆布，屈从于美国资本的意志。但是，英雄的古巴人民不仅以轻蔑的眼光对待这个“舆论”，而且向着美国所敌视的革命目标继续前进。他们摧毁了旧的国家机器和军事机器，建立了新的民族民主政权和革命武装部队；他们镇压了巴蒂斯塔残余势力和叛乱分子，扩大了民主自由权利，发动了爱国民主力量；他们实行土地改革，发展农业的多种经营，争取实现工业化；他们奉行独立的外交政策，发展符合国家利益的对外贸易。特别使华盛顿不安和不满的是，古巴政府征用美国公司霸占的土地，废除美国公司的一切租让权，开始收回地下的石油资源，不断动摇着美国垄断资本掠夺古巴人民的根基。
    于是，美国干涉者暴跳如雷，原形毕露了。艾森豪威尔竟亲自出马，叫嚣什么在古巴出现了“国际共产主义阴谋”，攻击古巴“废弃、扰乱和改变了”美国同古巴的“传统的经济关系”，并公然威胁说美国“将继续行使他们自己的主权来维护和保卫他们的合法利益”。反共是早已破烂不堪的幌子，敌视古巴革命、企图保持美国资本对古巴的掠夺和控制则是美国的真正野心。正如古巴总统多尔蒂科斯所指出的，艾森豪威尔之所以进行“国际共产主义阴谋”的诬蔑，是因为“古巴已找到了自己的政治、经济、社会和文化的表现形式”。卡斯特罗也指出：美国之所以要粗暴干涉古巴的内政，是因为古巴的土地改革触犯了外国公司的利益，因此，他们就企图使古巴回到过去的黑暗状态中去，以便重新在古巴的土地上建立奴役制度。这都一针见血地道破了这个真相：美帝国主义不能容许古巴摆脱在政治上和经济上附属和依赖于美国的半封建、半殖民地地位，求得真正的独立和自主。
    美国政府三番五次地照会古巴政府，居然要求古巴政府根据巴蒂斯塔卖国独裁政权的法律和所谓国际法，使美国公司在古巴的投资和“工作”能“在互相满意的基础上继续下去”，或者立即预先以现金按最高价格赔偿被征用的美国产业。显然，美国是企图阻挠古巴收回和征用美国公司所霸占的土地和资源，使美国公司得以继续掠夺和控制古巴。在美国看来，古巴政府无权废除卖国政权的法律，无权颁布实行土地改革、征用美国大庄园的土地的法律，以及废除美国公司关于石油和矿业的租让权的法律。这是十足的帝国主义强盗逻辑。至于古巴政府根据宪法和自己的财政条件，规定对被征用的土地在二十年的期限以债券形式（付予4.5％的利息）给予赔偿，并不是无偿的没收。这种对长期榨取古巴的美国垄断资本采取的赎买政策，不能不算是十分宽容的。美国要求立即预先以现金按最高价格赔偿的要挟行为，完全是一种无耻的讹诈。古巴政府断然拒绝了美国政府的这些无理要求，坚决地维护了神圣的国家主权，保证了民族经济的独立发展。
    正是由于美国的粗暴干涉，使古美关系日益紧张。但是，美国政府竟别有用心地把责任推到古巴身上，大事宣传什么古巴维护主权、反对干涉的正义斗争，造成了古美关系的“不断恶化”。
    因此，美国之所以敌视和干涉古巴革命，不仅仅是为了所谓“保卫”美国资本在古巴的“合法权利”，而且是为了破坏古巴的民族民主革命，使古巴继续依附美国，成为美国的原料供应和商品倾销的市场，成为美国“泛美体系”中的军事基地。
    又一海盗旗帜——“现代门罗主义”
    美国扼杀古巴革命的更重要的目的是，扑灭古巴革命对整个拉丁美洲民族民主运动所引起的巨大的深远的影响，以保持美国对拉丁美洲的控制和掠夺。
    古巴人民的胜利，是几年来蓬勃发展的拉丁美洲民族民主运动中的一次最重大的胜利。它集中地反映了拉丁美洲同美帝国主义及其代理人之间的矛盾和冲突的尖锐化，因而古巴革命的胜利、巩固和发展就成了拉丁美洲各国争取独立发展和人民民主运动的鲜明旗帜，成了拉丁美洲从一个半世纪前的民族独立革命走向新的民族民主革命的里程碑。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席隆巴多·托列达诺最近指出，古巴革命开辟了美洲第二次伟大的解放革命的时代，它宣告了拉丁美洲将要发生的一系列革命的开始，不管美国垄断组织愿不愿意，拉丁美洲将改变半殖民地的结构和消除依附状态。
    古巴革命是拉丁美洲第一个采取武装斗争形式取得胜利的革命。被推翻的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权拥有美国长期训练和武装的强大军队，而古巴又是距离美国仅九十海里的所谓“美国台阶上”的小国，美国利用它在古巴的基地上的几万驻军和它同古巴的短距离的地理条件，直接间接地支持独裁政府镇压人民的起义。美帝国主义曾竭力散布所谓“地理宿命论”、职业军队威力无比和美国不可战胜等等谬论，妄图证明拉丁美洲各国人民不可能取得民族民主革命的胜利。然而，古巴人民所支持的武装力量，由小到大，由弱到强，终于推翻了美国支持的武装到牙齿的独裁政府，粉碎了美帝国主义的谬论。因此，古巴革命的胜利，大大地鼓舞和推动了拉丁美洲人民争取完全独立和民主自由的斗争。首先是多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭这几个残存的独裁国家的人民纷纷起而步古巴人民的后尘，开展了武装斗争。巴拿马、波多黎各和其他国家的人民运动也更加蓬勃地发展起来。加勒比海地区的局势从此发生了巨大的变化，反美浪潮席卷整个拉丁美洲。
    其次，古巴人民的革命胜利，不同于以往拉丁美洲人民推翻十个独裁政权的不彻底的革命，或是像1954年危地马拉的不巩固的民主革命。古巴人民在推翻了美国代理人的独裁政权以后，并不限于改换统治的形式。新的政权还建立在人民更广泛的团结和革命更深入发展的巩固基础上，因而能够抗得住美国的干涉和颠覆阴谋，保卫革命的果实。古巴革命所解决的问题——坚决摆脱美帝国主义的控制、废除半封建的土地关系、维护国家的独立主权、建立广泛的民族民主政权和争取民族经济的独立发展，这都是拉丁美洲各国民族民主革命所面临的共同问题和争取实现的奋斗目标。因此，古巴革命给拉丁美洲其他国家的人民指出了一条取得革命的彻底胜利的道路。正如最近举行的拉丁美洲争取和平会议所指出的，古巴革命“实现着拉丁美洲各国人民的解放愿望，并向他们指出前进的道路”。
    因此，古巴的革命就不能不对整个拉丁美洲民族民主革命的深刻发展，产生极其深远的影响。
    最后，一年多来古巴人民反抗美国干涉的激烈斗争，彻底地暴露了美帝国主义是拉丁美洲的民族民主利益的死敌，同时又是并非不可战胜的死敌。古巴人民从斗争中受到教育和锻炼，变得日益坚强起来，而美国干涉者则不断受到挫折，变得日益孤立和狼狈。这就使得拉丁美洲其他国家的人民从古巴人民的斗争中同样受到教育和锻炼，进一步认识到必须加强民族民主力量的团结，坚决粉碎美帝国主义利用各种伪装和欺骗以图加强控制和镇压的阴谋。
    正因为这样，美帝国主义对古巴革命的胜利和深入发展感到惶惶不可终日，把扑灭古巴革命的火焰当作“弥补后院”，镇压整个拉丁美洲民族民主运动的矛头的集中点。美国一年多以来的干涉活动，艾森豪威尔最近的南美之行，都证明了这一点。艾森豪威尔继他在中东打出的臭名远扬的海盗旗帜——艾森豪威尔主义之后，现在在拉丁美洲打出了又一面海盗旗帜——“现代门罗主义”。其内容是：第一、加强以美国威慑力量为“安全之锚”的“泛美制度”和“泛美共同防御条约”；第二、以美元为诱饵，假“泛美经济开发和合作”为名，行其进一步加强经济控制之实；第三、以“反对共产主义传播到这个大陆的任何一个国家”为名，镇压拉丁美洲民族民主运动；第四、组织干涉古巴革命的又一危地马拉事件。但是，与此同时，拉丁美洲各国人民保卫古巴革命，支援拉丁美洲革命的运动，也汹涌澎湃地从一个高潮走向新的高潮。艾森豪威尔在南美之行中，到处受到各国群众高呼“反对干涉古巴”、“古巴万岁”的宏亮口号的回答，其景况比尼克松受到的臭鸡蛋和西红柿的袭击还要狼狈。最近拉丁美洲人民在“支援拉丁美洲人民周”发表的“拉丁美洲宣言”中，要求进行反帝国主义和反封建的革命，并号召加强对古巴革命的团结一致的支持。这就标志着拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争已进入了一个新的阶段。拉丁美洲人民争取民族民主革命的斗争，还得到了强大的社会主义阵营和各国人民的支持。他们高举的“拉丁美洲是拉丁美洲人民的拉丁美洲”的正义的旗帜，一定能够战胜美国“现代门罗主义”的海盗旗帜。美国在拉丁美洲恣意横行的时代一去不复返了。
