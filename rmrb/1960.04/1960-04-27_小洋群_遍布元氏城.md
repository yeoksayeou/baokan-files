    "Small Foreign Groups" Spread Throughout Yuanshi County
    The Yuanshi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, implementing the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's Industrial Secretary Conference, mobilized the masses to vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" industries. The county adopted two methods: one was large factories building small factories, "the hen laying eggs," leading to a large group; the other was old factories leading new factories, "the hen spreading its wings," establishing a network of designated points. Since the beginning of spring this year, 48 "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" factories and mines have been built, and 70 are being actively prepared for construction.
    In the process of building factories, the county adhered to the principle of adapting to local conditions, building factories where there were raw materials. As a result, more than 20 factories were quickly built and put into production, already producing more than 110 kinds of products, including pig iron, raw coal, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural technological transformation.

    “小洋群”遍布元氏城
    中共河北省元氏县委，贯彻省委工业书记会议精神，发动群众，大办“小土群”、“小洋群”工业。这个县采用了两种方法：一是大厂建小厂“母鸡下蛋”，一带一大群；一是老厂带新厂，“母鸡展翅”，布网定点。从今年入春以来，已经建成“小土群”，“小洋群”厂矿四十八个，正在积极筹建的七十个。
    这个县在建厂过程中，本着因地制宜的原则，那里有原料就在那里建厂，因而，有二十多个工厂迅速建成投入了生产，已经生产出生铁、原煤、农药、化肥等一百一百一十多种产品，有力地支持了工业和农业技术改造。
