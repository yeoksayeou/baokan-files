Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 8th: Nearly three thousand workers and representatives from all walks of life held a memorial service in Tokyo this evening for Kubo Kiyoshi, a Miike coal mine worker who was murdered by monopoly capitalists.

Representatives from all sectors of Japan delivered eulogies at the meeting. They expressed deep sorrow for the martyrdom of Kubo Kiyoshi and extreme indignation at the brutality of the ruling class. They pledged to fight against the enemies of Japanese workers and the people.

Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the 3.5 million workers of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will never allow the dark history of Japan to repeat itself.

Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the actions of the monopoly capital group in murdering Kubo Kiyoshi prove that militarism has been revived in Japan. He emphasized that the Socialist Party will continue to fight.

Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, said that the people of Japan are intensifying their struggle against the reactionary policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government and are convinced that their cause is a just one. He said that the Communist Party will devote itself to the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Commentator Yoko Matsuoka said in her speech that the future of the country is in the hands of the independent people. Now is the time for the people to rise up and crush the "Security Treaty."

Mutsuo Miyakawa (transliteration), Chairman of the Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union, said that the Miike coal miners will carry the struggle against layoffs to the end.

After the memorial service, the participants held a solemn protest demonstration in front of the Mitsui Mining Company, holding Kubo Kiyoshi's portrait.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on the 7th, on behalf of the Chinese workers, angrily condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government for condoning monopoly capitalists to employ violent groups to suppress the trade union movement and assassinate coal miners.

Mitsui Coal Mine monopoly capital in Japan directed violent groups to beat striking workers at the Miike Coal Mine on March 28th and 29th. More than one hundred workers were beaten, and one worker was killed. This atrocity by the Nobusuke Kishi government and Japanese monopoly capitalists has been strongly protested by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: "The heroic struggle of the Miike coal miners against 'enterprise rationalization' and to safeguard trade union rights has won the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people and the sympathy of just public opinion. The reactionary government and monopoly capitalists have been unprecedentedly isolated. We firmly believe that Japanese coal miners will be more united, persevere in their struggle, and achieve final victory."
