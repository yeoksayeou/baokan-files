Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 4th. A grand military parade was held on Dózsa György Square in Budapest on April 4th to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation.

From early morning, residents of the capital, dressed in festive attire, flocked to Dózsa György Square through streets adorned with red flags. The Hungarian armed forces of various branches, neatly lined up in the square, exchanged festive greetings with the working people who came here, and the square was filled with an atmosphere of great unity between the army and the people.

At exactly 10 o'clock, Hungarian party and state leaders Kádár, Münnich, Dobi, and others, as well as the head of the Soviet delegation, Mazurov, stepped onto the rostrum, and the audience applauded warmly.

Subsequently, the Hungarian Minister of Defense, Révész, inspected the armed forces and delivered a speech.

He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet army, the liberator of the Hungarian people. He then said that today the Hungarian people's regime is more consolidated than ever, and the broad masses are accelerating the construction of socialism with creative labor. He pointed out that the international situation is also conducive to the realization of Hungary's construction plans, and that truth and strength are on the side of the socialist camp, which defends the cause of human progress and peace.

Révész pointed out that the Hungarian working people, united with the people of the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist countries, will continue to wage the struggle to defend socialism and peace in the future. He said that we must continue to strengthen loyalty to socialism and the people's regime in our army, strengthen the unity between the army and the people, and strengthen the cooperation and friendship of the national armed forces. We must achieve new successes in completing the tasks of military and political training, and in strengthening army discipline and combat effectiveness.

Révész concluded by saying that we must vigilantly defend the people's regime, the achievements of socialism, and the independence of our motherland, and resolutely oppose all kinds of provocations by enemies at home and abroad. We will continue to strengthen the militant friendship with the Soviet army and the fraternal troops of other socialist countries. At any time, we will be a strong and reliable pillar in defending socialism and peace.

After the speech, fifteen thunderous salutes and the solemn national anthem resounded in the square. Then, the parade began. Leading the way were the cadets of the military academy, followed by neat formations of infantry, worker pickets, and troops from other branches of the armed forces. Jet aircraft also flew overhead in orderly formations. As the heroic and high-spirited modern troops passed through the square, the audience welcomed them with stormy and enthusiastic applause. People were proud to have such a powerful armed force.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Hungary, a delegation of Soviet veteran soldiers, a delegation of Chinese journalists, and delegations of journalists from other fraternal countries also attended today's military parade.
