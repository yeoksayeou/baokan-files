The advanced experience of "four (shift) eight (hour) interlocking shifts" created by the coal industry sector has been widely promoted in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal mines of the metallurgical industry department and the mining sectors of the chemical industry. The results of the promotion have proved that this new form of production organization is not only suitable for the coal industry, which has single products, multiple tools, multiple types of work, multiple processes, and constantly moving workplaces, but is also applicable to other similar underground operations.

The ferrous and non-ferrous metal mines of the metallurgical industry department once sent representatives to Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan to learn the experience of "four-eight interlocking shifts." To date, more than half of the large and medium-sized mines in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal mining sectors have fully promoted this advanced experience. In all mines that have promoted "four-eight interlocking shifts," the actual working hours per shift have generally increased by one and a half to two hours, work efficiency has increased by 15% to 30%, mining intensity (the number of ore mined per unit area in a certain period of time) has increased by 15% to 25%, and tunneling progress has increased by 15% to 30%. Because mining and tunneling are accelerated and the roof pressure is reduced, safe production is also guaranteed. New changes have also taken place in enterprise management and the workers' mental outlook. This new form of production organization facilitates the training of miners into all-rounders and can promote the development of comprehensive work teams in mining enterprises.

The mining enterprises of the chemical industry department also sent a working group to Kailuan Coal Mine in December last year to learn the experience of "four-eight interlocking shifts." At present, many units, such as Xiangshan Pyrite Mine and Jingxiang Phosphate Mine, have completed the pilot work of promoting "four-eight interlocking shifts" and are promoting it universally. After Jinping Phosphate Mine implemented "four-eight interlocking shifts" on some working faces, work efficiency generally increased by 10% to 15%; the daily output of one working face also increased by 1.6 times compared with the past. While adopting this new form of production organization, Xiangshan Pyrite Mine implemented the use of electric shovels to replace manual ore digging, and the production efficiency of each working face has increased by more than two times compared with the past.

    四八交叉作业适用于一切矿山
    黑色和有色金属矿山及化工采矿部门已广泛推行
    本报讯　煤炭工业部门创造的“四（班）八（小时）交叉作业”先进经验，已经在冶金工业部门的黑色、有色金属矿山以及化学工业的采矿部门中广泛推广。推广的结果证明，这一新的生产组织形式不但适合于产品单一、多工具、多工种、多工序以及工作场所不断向前移动的采煤工业，而且对其他类似的地下作业也是适用的。
    冶金工业部门的黑色和有色金属矿山曾经派代表到唐山开滦煤矿学习了“四八交叉作业”的经验。到目前为止，黑色和有色金属采矿部门已有半数以上的大中型矿山全面推广了这一先进经验。凡是推广了“四八交叉作业”的各矿，每班实际生产工时普遍增加了一小时半到二小时，工效提高15％到30％，采矿强度（单位面积在一定时间内采出的矿石数）提高15％到25％，掘进进度提高15％到30％。因为采掘加快，顶板压力减少，还保证了安全生产。在企业管理、工人的精神面貌等方面，也发生了新的变化。这种新的生产组织形式，便于把矿山工人培养成多面手，并能促进矿山企业综合工作队的发展。
    化学工业部门的矿山企业，去年12月间也曾派出工作组到开滦煤矿学习“四八交叉作业”的经验。现在，向山硫铁矿、荆襄磷矿等不少单位已经完成了推广“四八交叉作业”的试点工作，正在普遍推广。锦屏磷矿在部分工作面上实行“四八交叉作业”以后，工效普遍提高了10％到15％；有一个工作面的日产量还比过去猛增了一点六倍。向山硫铁矿在采用这一新的生产组织形式的同时，实行了利用电铲代替人工扒矿，每个工作面的生产效率比过去提高了二倍以上。
