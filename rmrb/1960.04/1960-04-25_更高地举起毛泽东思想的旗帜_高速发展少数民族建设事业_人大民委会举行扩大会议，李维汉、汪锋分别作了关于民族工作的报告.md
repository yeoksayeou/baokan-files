Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: The Enlarged Meeting of the Nationalities Committee of the Second National People's Congress was held in Beijing from the 9th to the 14th. The central topic of this meeting was: to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and realize the comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in minority nationality areas. Seventy-six members attended the meeting, along with eighty-eight deputies to the National People's Congress from minority nationality areas across the country, thirty-nine members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and leading cadres from the Nationalities Committee of the Second National People's Congress and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, as well as heads of the United Front Work Departments of the Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, totaling 286 people.

During the meeting, Li Weihan, Head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a speech on nationalities work.

Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, reported to the conference on the great achievements of nationalities work and future tasks. He pointed out: Due to the comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the backward economic and cultural conditions of minority nationality areas in our country are undergoing rapid and profound changes. Wang Feng said that in the past two years, on the basis of the victory of the Rectification Campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party and the government have continued to carry out socialist, communist, and patriotic education among the people of all nationalities, constantly criticized and overcome various Right-leaning thoughts and nationalist ideas, and implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction. In the vast majority of minority nationality areas, a comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the people's commune system have been realized, and technological and cultural revolution movements have been launched, enabling minority nationality areas to enter a historical period of high-speed and leaping development together with Han areas.

Wang Feng reported on the achievements of various constructions in minority nationality areas. He said that the total industrial output value of ethnic autonomous regions increased by 84% in 1958 compared with 1957, and by about 39% in 1959 compared with 1958. A large number of small and medium-sized industrial enterprises have been generally established in most minority nationality areas. A certain number of large-scale industrial enterprises such as iron and steel, machinery, electricity, and textiles have been established in the four autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia, and many other ethnic autonomous regions. The total number of workers from minority nationalities reached more than 820,000 in 1958. The total grain output of ethnic autonomous regions across the country increased by 41% in 1958 compared with 1957, and by more than 10% in 1959 compared with 1958. The "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase has been generally implemented in the vast majority of minority nationality areas, and the yield per unit area of grain has been significantly improved. Many minority nationality areas that have long suffered from grain shortages have not only achieved self-sufficiency in grain but also have a surplus for transfer to other areas. The pastoral areas of minority nationalities have gradually changed the backward situation of simply engaging in animal husbandry and moving from place to place in search of water and grass. Generally, the pastoral areas of minority nationalities have implemented the principle of focusing on animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, developing diversified operations, and the "Eight Measures" for increasing livestock production. More than 50% of herdsmen have settled down, and the animal husbandry economy in the vast majority of minority nationality areas has entered a new stage of high-speed development. Primary school education has been basically universalized in most ethnic autonomous regions, and the cultural learning of workers and peasants in their spare time has become a high tide. The vast majority of illiterate young and middle-aged people of minority nationalities have participated in literacy learning. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia, and some other ethnic autonomous regions have initially formed an education network from kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools to universities. In 1959, there were more than 54,000 health institutions in minority nationality areas, an increase of 41% compared with 1958. The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating major diseases has been widely launched. All ethnic autonomous regions are showing a prosperous scene of population growth.

Wang Feng said that, like the Han areas, the high-speed development of economic and cultural construction in minority nationality areas is inseparable from the establishment, consolidation, and development of the people's communes. With the development of the people's commune movement in Han areas, the rural and pastoral areas of the vast majority of minority nationalities also basically realized the people's commune system in the second half of 1958. The number of peasant and herdsman households participating in the people's communes reached more than 90% of the total number of peasant and herdsman households in minority nationality areas. After a year of rectification, the people's communes in various ethnic regions have been consolidated and embarked on a path of sound development.

The excellent situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction across the country has created extremely favorable conditions for the thorough completion of democratic reforms and socialist transformations in minority nationality areas. All Tibetan areas in Gansu and most Tibetan areas in Qinghai have carried out democratic reforms and socialist transformations in the past two years, basically realizing the people's commune system. Minority nationality areas on the border of Yunnan, Tibetan and Yi areas in Sichuan, and some other minority nationality areas have also realized agricultural production cooperation in the past two years and have begun to establish some people's communes. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Tibet quickly quelled the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, carried out a vigorous democratic reform, and achieved a great victory. It is estimated that the democratic reform in the entire Tibet region, except for some remote areas, can be basically completed before spring plowing. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Tibet are working hard to thoroughly complete the historical task of democratic reform, actively developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, vigorously launching a movement to increase agricultural and animal husbandry production, and building a new democratic and socialist Tibet.

Beginning in the second half of 1958, mass revolutionary struggles against feudal oppression and exploitation systems in religion were also carried out in many minority nationality areas that believe in Islam and Lamaism. Now this struggle has also achieved a decisive victory. The in-depth development of the socialist revolution and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction have also promoted great reforms and changes in the customs and habits of various nationalities. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all nationalities consciously eradicated the old customs and bad habits that hindered the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and national development, promoted customs and habits that are conducive to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and national development, and established new socialist moral customs.

Wang Feng emphasized in his report that with the victory of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the people's commune movement, the socialist relations between nationalities in our country have also entered a new historical period. The unity of the motherland and the solidarity between nationalities have been further consolidated and developed on the basis of socialism. The vast majority of minority nationality people, together with the Han people, jointly labor and live in people's communes that are larger in scale and have a higher degree of public ownership than agricultural production cooperatives. Socialist unity and cooperation have been universally developed among various nationalities, learning from each other and helping each other. The connections between various nationalities are becoming closer and closer, and the commonalities are increasing. The factors of national integration are gradually increasing. This is the result of the continuous victory of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is also an inevitable trend in the social and historical development of our country.

Then, Wang Feng pointed out that according to the current excellent situation of socialist construction across the country and the actual situation of various minority nationality areas, in our nationalities work, we must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to carry out socialist, communist, and patriotic education among the people of all nationalities, thoroughly complete the democratic reforms (including the struggle against feudal oppression and exploitation systems in religion) and socialist transformations in minority nationality areas, further consolidate, improve, and develop the people's communes, vigorously carry out technological and cultural revolution movements in minority nationality areas, continuously develop the great unity and cooperation between nationalities, continue to mobilize young people in the interior to go to the border areas and minority nationality areas to participate in socialist construction, and realize the comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in minority nationality areas, so that minority nationalities can catch up with or approach the development level of the Han nationality in terms of economy and culture as soon as possible.

Based on the actual situation of minority nationality areas, Wang Feng explained in detail how these areas will firmly implement the central government's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry and combining it with the rapid development of agriculture, as well as taking steel as the key in industry, grain as the key in agriculture, and making comprehensive arrangements, and vigorously carrying out technological and cultural revolutions. Finally, he said that the tasks before us are glorious and arduous. The key to completing the tasks lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, continuously consolidating and developing the great unity and cooperation between nationalities, unremittingly fighting against bourgeois nationalism, and resolutely carrying the two-road struggle to the end.

The members and representatives of various nationalities conducted heated discussions on Li Weihan's speech and Wang Feng's report, unanimously expressing their support for and implementation of them. Representatives from the remote border areas introduced the new faces of their nationalities and regions after the Great Leap Forward, passionately praising the great victory of the Party's nationalities policy and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed that in order to better realize the comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in various ethnic regions, they will actively lead cadres and people of all nationalities to launch a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, constantly improve socialist, communist, and patriotic consciousness, and establish and strengthen the proletarian world outlook and national outlook.

In group discussions and general speeches, many representatives expressed their opinions on the issue of nationality relations. They believe that with the victorious development of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the nationalities are becoming closer and closer, and the relationship is becoming closer. In mutual learning and mutual assistance, the commonality is increasing, which is a great thing. The gradual increase in the factors of national integration reflects the common prosperity and development of all nationalities. This progressive phenomenon of historical development should be warmly welcomed, and the differences between nationalities should not be artificially expanded to hinder the progress of the nationality and the common development of the nationalities.

    更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜
    高速发展少数民族建设事业
    人大民委会举行扩大会议，李维汉、汪锋分别作了关于民族工作的报告
    新华社24日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会民族委员会扩大会议自9日到14日在北京举行。这次会议的中心议题是：更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，实现少数民族地区社会主义建设的全面的持续大跃进。参加会议的有七十六位委员，和来自全国各少数民族地区的八十八位全国人民代表大会代表，三十九位政协全国委员会委员，以及第二届全国人民代表大会民族委员会、中华人民共和国民族事务委员会的负责干部，各省、市、自治区的党委统战部长等，共二百八十六人。
    会议期间，中共中央统战部长李维汉作了关于民族工作的讲话。
    中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任汪锋向大会报告了民族工作的巨大成就和今后的任务。他指出：由于社会主义建设的全面连续的大跃进，我国少数民族地区经济和文化的落后状况，正在发生着急剧的、深刻的变化。汪锋说，两年来，党和政府在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，继续向各民族人民进行了社会主义、共产主义和爱国主义教育，不断地批判和克服了各种右倾思想和民族主义思想，贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，在绝大多数的少数民族地区，实现了社会主义建设的全面连续大跃进和人民公社化，开展了技术革命和文化革命运动，使少数民族地区和汉族地区一起，进入了一个高速度地飞跃发展的历史时期。
    汪锋报告了少数民族地区各项建设的成就。他说，各民族自治地方的工业总产值1958年比1957年增加84％，1959年又比1958年增加了39％左右。绝大部分少数民族地区普遍建立了大量的各种中小型工业企业，内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏等四个自治区和其他不少民族自治地方都建立起了一定数量的钢铁、机械、电力、纺织等大型工业企业。少数民族中的工人总数，1958年已达八十二万多人。全国各民族自治地方的粮食总产量1958年比1957年增加41％，1959年又比1958年增加了10％以上。绝大部分少数民族地区普遍实行了农业增产的“八字宪法”，粮食单位面积产量有显著提高。许多长期缺粮的少数民族地区不仅做到了粮食自给，而且有一部分余粮外调。少数民族牧业区已逐步改变了过去逐水草而居的、单纯经营畜牧业的落后状况，一般少数民族牧业区都实行了以牧为主、农牧结合、开展多种经营的方针和畜牧业增产的“八项措施”，50％以上的牧民已经实现了定居，绝大部分少数民族地区的畜牧业经济已进入高速度发展的新阶段。大部分民族自治地方的小学教育已基本普及，工农业余文化学习已经形成高潮，绝大多数少数民族青壮年文盲都参加了扫除文盲的学习。内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏及其他一部分民族自治地方都初步形成了从幼儿园、小学、中学到大学的教育网。1959年少数民族地区的卫生事业机构达到五万四千多个，比1958年增长了41％，以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动已经普遍展开，各民族自治地方都呈现出人口兴旺的繁荣景象。
    汪锋说：和汉族地区一样，少数民族地区经济和文化建设事业的高速度的发展，是和人民公社的建立、巩固和发展分不开的。随着汉族地区人民公社化运动的发展，绝大多数少数民族的农村和牧区也在1958年下半年基本上实现了人民公社化，参加人民公社的农牧户达到少数民族地区农牧户总数的90％以上。各民族地区的人民公社，经过一年来的整顿已经巩固起来，走上了健全发展的道路。
    全国社会主义建设大跃进的大好形势，为彻底完成少数民族地区的民主改革和社会主义改造创造了极为有利的条件。甘肃的全部藏族地区和青海的大部分藏族地区，都在这两年内进行了民主改革和社会主义改造，基本上实现了人民公社化。云南边疆的少数民族地区和四川的藏、彝族地区以及其他一些少数民族地区，也在这两年中实现了农业生产合作化，并且开始建立了一部分人民公社。西藏人民在党的领导和人民解放军的帮助下，迅速平息了反革命的武装叛乱，进行了轰轰烈烈的民主改革，取得了伟大胜利。估计整个西藏地区的民主改革，除了一些边远的地方以外，在春播前就可以基本完成。目前，西藏人民正在党的领导下，为彻底完成民主改革的历史任务，积极发展互助合作组织，大力开展农牧业丰产运动，建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋勇前进。
    从1958年下半年开始，在许多信仰伊斯兰教和喇嘛教的少数民族地区，还开展了反对宗教中封建压迫、剥削制度的群众革命斗争。现在这个斗争也已经取得了决定性的胜利。社会主义革命的深入发展和社会主义建设的大跃进，还促进了各民族的风俗习惯的大改革和大变化。各民族人民在党的领导下，自觉地革除了那些妨碍社会主义建设大跃进和民族发展的陈规陋习，发扬了有利于社会主义建设大跃进和民族发展的风俗习惯，树立了新的社会主义的道德风尚。
    汪锋在报告中着重指出，随着社会主义建设大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利，我国的社会主义的民族关系也进入了一个新的历史时期，祖国的统一和各民族之间的团结已经在社会主义的基础上得到了进一步的巩固和发展。绝大多数少数民族人民都和汉族人民一起，在比农业生产合作社规模更大、公有化程度更高的人民公社内共同劳动、共同生活，各民族之间普遍地发展了社会主义的大团结、大协作，互相学习，互相帮助。各民族之间的联系越来越密切，共同性越来越多，民族融合的因素正在逐步增长。这是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业不断胜利的结果，也是我国社会历史发展的必然趋势。
    接着，汪锋指出：根据当前全国社会主义建设的大好形势和各少数民族地区的实际情况，我们在民族工作方面，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，继续对各族人民进行社会主义、共产主义和爱国主义的教育，彻底完成少数民族地区的民主改革（包括反对宗教中封建压迫、剥削制度的斗争）和社会主义改造，进一步巩固、提高和发展人民公社，大力开展少数民族地区的技术革命和文化革命运动，不断发展各民族之间的大团结、大协作，继续动员内地青年前往边疆和少数民族地区参加社会主义建设，实现少数民族地区社会主义建设全面的持续大跃进，从而使少数民族能够尽快地在经济和文化方面赶上或接近汉族的发展水平。
    汪锋根据少数民族地区的实际情况，详尽地讲述了这些地区今后怎样坚决贯彻中央规定的以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合，以及工业以钢为纲，农业以粮为纲，全面安排的方针，和大搞技术革命与文化革命的问题。最后，他说，摆在我们面前的任务是光荣而艰巨的。完成任务的关键，在于沿着毛主席所指引的道路，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不断地巩固和发展各民族之间的大团结、大协作，坚持不懈地和资产阶级民族主义思想进行斗争，坚决把两条道路的斗争进行到底。
    各民族的委员、代表们，对李维汉的讲话和汪锋的报告，进行了热烈的讨论，一致表示拥护并贯彻执行。来自遥远边疆的代表，纷纷介绍本民族、本地区大跃进以后的崭新面貌，激情地赞颂着党的民族政策的伟大胜利，毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们表示，为了更好地实现各民族地区社会主义建设的全面持续大跃进，将要积极带动各民族干部和人民群众掀起一个学习毛主席著作的高潮，不断提高社会主义、共产主义和爱国主义觉悟，树立和坚定无产阶级的世界观和民族观。
    在小组讨论和大会发言中，有不少代表就民族关系问题，发表了意见。他们认为，随着大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利发展，各民族之间更加亲近，关系更加密切，在互相学习互相帮助中，共同性越来越多，这是个大好的事情。民族融合因素的逐步增长，正反映着各民族的共同繁荣和发展。应该热烈欢迎这种历史发展的进步现象，而不能人为地扩大民族之间的差异，来阻碍本民族的进步和各民族的共同发展。
