The workers enthusiastically sing:
	Millennial sledgehammers are all discarded,
	Motors and buttons take their place,
	Ventilation turns yellow smoke into white mist,
	Operators put on white coats,
	Steel casting is all done by machine,
	Doubling production is no problem.

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and I guarantee to conscientiously implement them in my work. Here, I will only report to the conference on the technical revolution in the steel casting workshop of Dalian Shipyard.

Our entire staff of Dalian Shipyard, like the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the shining light of the General Line, have won the victory of two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward.

In order to thoroughly change the backward face of production technology, rejuvenate the old factory, and make it evergreen, and to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, from the beginning of November last year, we launched a technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. After four months of hard work and skillful effort, the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of the entire factory have increased from 36.4% before November last year to 72%, basically eliminating heavy manual labor and manual operation, and realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized, automated and semi-automated production. With the increase of shipbuilding tasks this year and the need to manufacture relatively large marine low-speed diesel engines, we have saved more than a thousand workers, achieving increased production with reduced personnel, ensuring a good start and a complete victory for this year's production, and completing the first quarter's task fifteen days ahead of schedule. The steel casting workshop where I work is one that has completely changed its production technology in the wave of technical transformation of the entire factory. How did our workshop change its face?

Determined to Continuously Make Revolution, Resolutely Not Be an Asking Party

Our workshop is a relatively old sand casting workshop. Although in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the masses have put forward a large number of innovation proposals and made many reforms in technology, tools, and operation. The equipment capacity for casting large parts was insufficient, and the site area was small, so we adopted methods such as segmented modeling, tide mold casting, and using "tea kettle to cook pig's head" to melt 32 tons of steel with a three-ton electric furnace to solve the continuous difficulties encountered in production. However, the outdated and backward production equipment of the workshop and the large amount of manual operation (accounting for 64%) have not been fundamentally changed. The labor intensity of workers is very high, the production efficiency is low, and the labor force is always insufficient. The steel casting workshop has become a weak link in our factory's continued leap forward. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the development of production has been advancing by leaps and bounds, and this contradiction has become more prominent.

How to solve this contradiction? Some individuals advocated that the state should invest heavily to purchase new equipment and expand the factory buildings; and some comrades advocated "increasing workers"; but most people advocated relying on their own technical innovation and technical revolution to solve the problem. At this time, the factory Party committee issued the call for a technical revolution: "Work hard for a few months, give the old factory a new look, basically realize mechanization, and let the old soldiers get new guns," which pointed out a correct direction for us. The workshop Party branch mobilized the workers to speak out and debate, criticized various conservative ideas, and also put forward "resolutely not being an asking party". All the staff and workers warmly responded to the call of the Party and resolved to arm themselves and make revolution on their own. Thus, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement was carried out vigorously.

Pulling Out Two "Mountains"

At the beginning of the movement, everyone's goal was first focused on hitting the "gate" of anchor chains. Because hitting the "gate" relied entirely on twenty-seven strong young men hitting with twenty-pound sledgehammers, the labor intensity was high and the efficiency was low. A large number of anchor chains cast out were all piled up in the workshop because hitting the "gate" could not keep up. The piles became higher and higher, sometimes reaching the ridge of the roof, and the cranes could not pass. The workers compared it to two "mountains" and named them: one was Mount Everest and the other was Mount Tai. In order to deal with the mountains of anchor chains in a timely manner, the factory organized cadres to work here all year round, and sometimes even temporarily transferred one hundred to two hundred workers to rush to work. Completely removing these two "mountains" has long been an urgent need for production and a strong desire of the staff and workers. How to remove them and where to start, there were many difficulties. The workers were not intimidated and formed a special group to study. Everyone spoke out and contributed ideas. Finally, the workers were greatly inspired by the universal pneumatic hammer in the hull workshop at the technical transformation exhibition and took the initiative to learn from it. After returning, they designed a gantry pneumatic hammer themselves based on their own production characteristics and conditions. When manufacturing, they looked for materials in the scrap iron pile if they didn't have any. If they lacked castings, they made their own sand castings. If they didn't have installation equipment, they made do with what they had. When installing, they found a way to find the alignment without a platform. Yang Shipin, a retired worker, pondered for a day or two, and finally used two railroad pads to replace the platform for alignment. After a week of hard work, he finally successfully trial-produced it. Using machines to replace heavy manual labor increased production efficiency by five times and saved twenty workers. The workers said: "The mountains are pulled out by the roots, production leaps again, the passage is unobstructed, and the face of the workshop is changed."

As Long as You Dare to Think and Dare to Do, No Matter How Difficult Things Can Be Done

The fact of removing the two "mountains" tells us a truth. As long as you dare to think and dare to do, you can do anything. After the gate-hitting workers discarded the sledgehammers, the anchor chain modeling workers then put forward the slogan "Modeling should be mechanized, and the wooden hammer handle should be resolutely discarded." This was another major reform. Manual operation with wooden hammers has been used for anchor chain modeling for more than ten years. It was unthinkable in the past to solve the mechanization of anchor chain modeling on their own. After removing the two "mountains", the Party branch called on every worker to be bold in their imagination and widely express their opinions, so that everyone could put forward plans. Workers, cadres, and technicians all took action, reading books, looking for materials, thinking of ways, holding discussions, and visiting and learning everywhere. After several nights of hard work, they finally designed and trial-produced a combined local and foreign modeling machine. When the first modeling machine was tested, the vibration force was not strong and it was not easy to use. The onlookers came out to pour cold water, saying, "If the mantis can plow the land, why use the old ox? If a sand caster can make machines, why use a fitter?" Some individuals began to lose heart. The Party branch encouraged the workers, saying, "We must learn from failure and overcome technical barriers." Everyone's enthusiasm was even greater. At two o'clock in the morning, there were still some people surrounding the modeling machine to study ways. The branch secretary came to urge them, but they didn't go home. Finally, they found the problem and improved the steam inlet of the cylinder, and finally the experiment was successful. The use results increased efficiency by more than three times. The cold water basin of the onlookers was overturned. The anchor chain modeling machine was born in daring to think, daring to do, and overcoming numerous difficulties. It fundamentally liberated the workers from manual operation, making them feel happy and operate the machine for production happily.

One Step Follows Another, Advancing at High Speed

After the gantry hammer, modeling machine, and other innovative projects were put into production successively, the electric furnace section became a new weak link. Feeding and charging all relied on heavy manual labor. If a rapid revolution was not carried out, it would not be able to meet the needs of production. The method of reform was to transform the old electric furnace into a new type of automated electric furnace. However, the structure of the automated electric furnace was complex, with more than 4,400 parts, involving many types of work such as fitter, lathe worker, electrician, and civil construction. For our steel casting workers, it was more difficult to touch electrical things than to reform tools, but our workers were determined to transform it successfully and as soon as possible. The electric furnace transformation usually takes more than a month, which would not only affect the annual steel production, but also affect the good start in 1960. After repeated calculations, the electric furnace must be transformed successfully within ten days. This requires high-speed technical transformation. Some people said: "Technical transformation cannot be high-speed," "Ten days is impossible," and so on. We all put forward: "Difficulty is ahead, enthusiasm comes first, work hard and skillfully, break through thousands of barriers, climb to the sky without a ladder, and be sure to complete it in ten days." The factory Party committee organized the power workshop, the capital construction section, and our workshop to fight together, carrying out a large-scale competition between workshops, between work groups, and between individuals, comparing enthusiasm and comparing drilling spirit. It formed a situation where you chase after me, grab difficulties when you see them, give way to convenience when you see it, everyone is making innovations, and everyone is tackling key problems. Demolishing 30 cubic meters of concrete and excavating 220 cubic meters of earthwork. It is also necessary to build 70 cubic meters of new concrete, a task that would take 20 days to complete, but all the staff and workers of the capital construction section, in order to support us and ensure that the progress of the next process was not affected, formed a three-in-one research group and broke through three major key problems in only four days, completing the task ahead of schedule. The staff and workers of the power workshop put forward the slogan "Others first, ourselves later" and took the initiative to undertake the assembly task, adopting the method of assigning people, assigning tasks, assigning time, and assigning measures. They carried out two pre-assemblies in advance, and as a result, it only took two days to assemble the automated electric furnace. The entire electric furnace transformation only took eight days. After being put into production, it shortened the time for smelting one furnace of steel from four hours to three hours in the past; charging was completely replaced by machines instead of manual labor, and charging one furnace was shortened from one hour to five minutes. The electric furnace section, which has always been short of labor, also freed up six people to support other types of work.

One Ring Moves, Hundreds of Rings Follow, Marching Towards Full Mechanization

After the electric furnace was mechanized and automated, the enthusiasm of the masses became greater and greater, and their confidence became more and more sufficient. People with conservative ideas received the most profound and practical education in the face of facts, and their thinking was liberated. Everyone came to think of ways and make technical transformations, holding brainstorming sessions and Zhuge Liang meetings, organizing treasure hunting teams, etc. It was truly a surging sea of people, a rolling wave, and a wave of comprehensive reforms was set off. The modeling workers for marine steel castings said: "If anchor chain modeling can be mechanized, our individual production must also be mechanized." They visited brother factories "to learn from teachers and make friends," "to learn and gain experience," and formed four commando teams, fighting for fifteen days, and made a sandblasting machine, opening the way for the mechanization of marine casting modeling. The crane workers formed a universal commando team, determined to realize the long-cherished ideal of "anchor chain dragging underground." Undergrounding requires the technology of many types of work such as riveters, welders, civil engineers, and sand casters. They put forward the slogan "Everyone should be a versatile player." If they didn't know how, they would learn, learning while doing. From design to construction, they completely contracted it themselves, doing production during the day and technical transformation at night. After three days of hard work, they achieved it. In short, all the staff and workers in the entire workshop took action, from major types of work to auxiliary types of work, from workers to clerks and cadres, no one was not making innovations. Many people have become innovation fanatics. Drinking tea, eating, walking, and sleeping, they are all thinking about making innovations. After a short period of more than four months, 32 larger pieces of equipment were manufactured. The mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of the entire workshop increased from 32.2% to 87.2%. All types of work have basically achieved mechanized production. The workers liberated themselves from manual operation with their own hands, and they were incomparably happy.

	Millennial sledgehammers are all discarded,
	Motors and buttons take their place,
	Ventilation turns yellow smoke into white mist,
	Operators put on white coats,
	Steel casting is all done by machine,
	Doubling production is no problem.

This is the workers' song of praise.

Underground is the Workshop, Above Ground is a Garden

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, our workshop workers, inspired by the battle cry of "Old soldiers get new guns, old factories get new looks," not only basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of production operations, but also beautified the workshop, determined to put the inspection and repair process of anchor chains underground, making the anchor chain workshop an "underground" workshop, and building a garden above the underground workshop.

Originally, our workshop repaired anchor chains, whether it was windy or rainy, snowy or icy, the workers were working in the open air. The anchor chains are very heavy and very long, and it is very inconvenient to drag them around, and accidents of rope breaking and injuring workers often occur, and production is very unsafe. A particularly prominent problem is that our factory is an old factory, and production is developing rapidly. The quantity of anchor chains that we need to produce in all aspects is very large, which requires a large amount of work area, but the site is limited, and anchor chains are placed everywhere. It is impossible to find a foothold when walking in the anchor chain workshop. The workers are determined to change this production face, dare to think and dare to do, dig a tunnel, move the entire anchor chain repair process to the underground for execution, changing the conditions of insufficient work area, poor working conditions, and unsafe production, realizing mechanized production, and also preparing to install sound isolators to reduce noise. Apple trees will be planted above the underground workshop, grape seedlings will be inserted, fish ponds will be built, and pavilions will be built to avoid shade, making it a good place for workers to study, rest, and entertain in their spare time. The young people said: "Underground is the workshop, above ground is the garden, in the future, dating doesn't have to go to the park." This not only realizes the mechanization of the production process, but also beautifies the workshop, killing two birds with one stone, fundamentally changing the face of the workshop.

Universally Open Up Innovation Flowers, Universally Bearing Leap Forward Fruits

The workers said: "Technical transformation is happy, and production indicators go straight to the sky." That's right, since our workshop has vigorously engaged in technical transformation, production has really been changing with each passing day, exceeding the target every month, and rising step by step, and has also achieved increased production with reduced personnel. Taking February as an example: the labor force was reduced by 37% compared with February last year, but the output value was increased by 122.8% compared with February last year, and the labor productivity was 345% of the same period last year. The average daily output value in January was increased by 17.1% compared with December last year, February was increased by 30.3% compared with January, and March is expected to be increased by 21.2% compared with February. The product quality has also been greatly improved. The average scrap rate in January and February this year was 1.7%, which was 1.96% lower than last year. What kind of force can make us have such great strength and achieve such results? The workers' conclusion is:

	Three red flags are flying high,
	Overcoming difficulties is as easy as turning one's hand,
	Wise leadership of the Communist Party,
	A light boat breaks through thousands of waves,
	Praising the leader Chairman Mao,
	Thousands of merits and achievements belong to the Party.

The fact that our workshop can realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in the shortest possible time is inseparable from the vigorous promotion of the three-in-one combination inside and outside the factory. In our work, the Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, and various brother factories have given us strong support. Now our workshop is moving towards automation. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, with greater efforts, we can completely arm our workshop into a modern new type of workshop in the shortest possible time.

    老厂换新装　“老兵换新枪”
    唐立言代表谈大连造船厂铸钢车间的巨大变化工人热情地歌唱：
    千年大锤全抛弃，马达电钮来代替，
    通风黄烟变白气，操作穿上白大衣，
    铸钢全部用机器，生产翻番没问题。
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念、谭震林副总理的报告，并保证在工作中认真贯彻执行。这里，我仅就大连造船厂铸钢车间技术革命的情况向大会做一汇报。
    我们大连造船厂全体职工，和全国人民一样，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的阳光普照下，赢得了两年连续大跃进的胜利。
    为了彻底改变落后的生产技术面貌，使老厂返老还童，松柏长青，获得今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，从去年11月初，开展了以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革命运动。经过前后四个月的苦战加巧干，现在全厂机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化已由去年11月前的36.4％提高到72％，基本上消灭了重体力劳动和手工操作，实现了机械化与半机械化、自动化与半自动化生产。在今年的造船任务增加很大，还要制造比较大型的船用低速柴油机的情况下，节省了千余名劳动力，做到了增产又减人，保证了今年生产开门红，满堂红，提前十五天完成了一季任务。我所在的铸钢车间，就是在全厂技术改造的浪潮中彻底改变了生产技术面貌的一个。我们车间是怎样改变了面貌的呢？决心不断闹革命，坚决不当伸手派
    我们车间是一个较老的翻砂车间，虽然几年来，特别是大跃进以来，群众提出大量革新建议，在工艺、工具、操作等方面做了不少改革。铸造大型部件的设备能力不够，场地面积小，就采取分段造型、潮模铸造以及用“茶壶煮猪头”使三吨电炉熔化三十二吨钢水等办法，解决了生产当中不断遇到的困难。但是，车间的生产设备陈旧落后，手工操作量大（占64％）的状况还没有根本改变，工人劳动强度很高，生产效率较低，劳动力总是不够，铸钢车间已经成为我们工厂继续跃进的一个薄弱环节。尤其在党的八届八中全会以后，生产的发展更是突飞猛进，这个矛盾就更加突出。
    怎么解决这个矛盾呢？个别人主张国家大量投资，购置新设备和扩建厂房；还有个别同志主张“增加工人”；但是大多数人主张靠自己闹技术革新、技术革命来解决。这时，厂党委发出“大干几个月，老厂换新装，基本实现机械化，老兵拿新枪”的技术革命的号召，给我们指出了一条正确的方向。车间党总支发动工人进行了鸣放、辩论，批判了各种保守思想，也提出了“坚决不当伸手派”。全体职工热烈响应党的号召，决心自己武装自己，自己动手革命，于是，技术革新、技术革命运动轰轰烈烈的开展起来。
    拔掉两座“大山”
    运动一开始，大家的目标首先就集中到打锚链“水口”上来。因为，打“水口”全靠二十七个棒小伙子用二十磅大锤打，劳动强度高，效率低。浇铸出来的大批的锚链，由于打“水口”跟不上，不得不全堆积在车间里，越来堆的越高，有时堆的顶到了屋脊，吊车都走不过去了。工人把它比做是两座“大山”，并命名为：一是喜马拉雅山，一是泰山。为及时处理堆积如山的锚链，工厂常年组织干部在这里劳动，有时甚至临时抽调一百到二百名工人前来突击。彻底拔掉这两座“大山”早就是生产迫待需要和职工的强烈愿望。怎样拔，从那里做起，是有许多困难的，工人们并没被吓倒，组成专门小组进行研究，大家都鸣放、献计。最后工人在技术改造展览会上看到船体车间的万象风动锤，受到很大启发，就主动去学习。回来后，根据自己的生产特点和条件，自己动手设计出龙门式风动锤来。制造时，没有材料就到废铁堆找，少铸件就自己翻砂，没有安装设备就因陋就简，能代就代。安装时没有平台找正，大家想办法。在职养老工人杨士品苦思了一两天，最后用两块铁道垫平代替平台找正，经过一周的苦战，终于试制成功了。用机器代替了笨重体力劳动，提高了生产效率五倍，节约了劳动力二十人。工人说：“大山连根拔掉，生产跃上再跃，往来通行无阻，改变车间面貌。”
    只要敢想敢干，再难的事也能做成
    拔掉两座“大山”的事实告诉了我们一条真理，只要敢想敢干就什么事情也能做出来。打水口扔掉大锤以后，锚链造型工人接着提出来“造型实现机械化，坚决扔掉木锤把”的口号。这又是一个重大改革。锚链造型用手工操作使用木锤有十几年了。自己动手解决锚链造型机械化，过去连想都不敢想，搬掉两座“大山”后，党总支号召每个工人都大胆设想，广泛进行鸣放，大家来提方案。工人、干部、技术人员都动起来，看书、找资料、想办法，开讨论会，到处走访学习，经过几个通宵的苦战，终于设计并试制出土洋结合的造型机。在第一台造型机试验时，振动力不强，不好用。观潮派就出来泼冷水了，说什么：“螳螂能耕地还用老牛干什么，翻砂匠能造机器就不用钳工了”。个别人开始泄气。党总支鼓励工人说：“要从失败中找经验，攻下技术关。”大家的干劲更足了，深夜两点，还有一些人围着造型机研究门路。总支书记来赶也不回家。最后找到了毛病，改进了汽缸的汽口终于试验成功了，使用结果提高效率三倍多。打翻了观潮派的冷水盆。锚链造型机就是这样在敢想敢干、攻破重重困难中诞生的。它使工人从根本上摆脱了手工操作，心情舒畅，愉快的操纵机器进行生产。
    一步紧接一步，高速前进
    龙门锤、造型机等革新项目相继投入生产后，电炉工段又成了新的薄弱环节，送料、装料全靠笨重的体力劳动，若不迅速革命就不能适应生产需要。改革的方法，就是把旧电炉改制成新型的自动化电炉。但自动化电炉的结构复杂，部件达四千四百余件，涉及到钳工、车工、电工、土木建筑等许多工种，这对我们铸钢工人来说，要想碰碰电气化的东西，比改革工具困难就更大一些，但我们工人立下雄心大志，一定要改造成功，还要尽快改好。改制电炉在通常情况下需要一个多月的时间，不仅要影响全年钢的产量，而且也影响1960年开门红。经过反复计算，必须在十天内把电炉改制成功。这就要高速度地进行技术改造。有人说：“技术改造不能高速度”，“十天根本不可能”等等。我们大家伙提出来：“困难在前，干劲当先，苦干加巧干，闯过千重关，无梯也登天，坚决十天完。”工厂党委组织动力车间、基建科和我们车间联合作战，开展了车间之间、工组之间、个人之间的大竞赛，比干劲，比钻劲。形成了你追我赶，见困难就抢，见方便就让，个个闹革新，人人攻关键的局面。拆除三十立方米混凝土，挖二百二十立方米土方。还要新建七十立方米混凝土，这一任务需要二十天才能完成，但基本建设科的全体职工，为了支援我们，保证不影响下道工序的进度，组成三结合研究小组，连破三大关键，只用四天就提前完成了。动力车间的职工提出：“先别人，后自己”的口号，主动承担了组装的任务，采取定人、定活、定时间、定措施，事前进行了两次预装，结果只用两天的时间就把自动化电炉组装起来。整个电炉的改制只用了八天时间。投入生产后，使过去四小时炼一炉钢缩短到三小时；装料完全用机械代替了手工劳动，装一炉料由一个小时缩短到五分钟。历来劳动力不足的电炉工段，还抽出了六个人支援了别的工种。
    一环动，百环跟，向全面机械化进军
    电炉实现机械化、自动化以后，群众的干劲愈来愈大，信心愈来愈足。有保守思想的人在事实面前受到了最深刻最实际的教育，思想解放了。大家都来想办法，闹技术改造，召开设想会、诸葛亮会，组织献宝队等等，真是人海起伏，波浪滚滚，掀起了全面大改革的浪潮。船用铸钢件的造型工人说：“锚链造型能实现机械化，我们的单个生产，也一定要实现机械化”。他们到各兄弟厂“访师拜友”，“取经学艺”，并且组成了四个突击队，大战了十五天，制成一台抛砂机，为船用铸件造型机械化打开了道路。吊车工人组成万能突击队，决心实现多年理想的“锚链拖拉地道化”。搞地道化需要铆工、电焊、土建、翻砂等等多工种的技术。他们提出“人人都当多面手”的口号，不会的就学，边学边干。从设计到施工完全由自己包下来，白天干生产，夜晚干技术改造。苦战三天就实现了。总之，全车间职工都干起来了，从主要工种到辅助工种，从工人到职员、干部，无人无处不闹革新。很多人都成了革新迷。喝茶、吃饭、走路、睡觉都想着闹革新的事。经过短短的四个多月的时间制造出来较大的设备就有三十二项。全车间的机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化，由32.2％提高到87.2％。所有工种都基本实现了机械化生产。工人自己动手从手工操作中解放了自己，心情无比喜悦。
    千年大锤全抛弃，
    马达电钮来代替，
    通风黄烟变白气，
    操作穿上白大衣，
    铸钢全部用机器，
    生产翻番没问题。
    这就是工人们的赞歌。
    地下是工段，地上是花园
    在技术革新与技术革命运动中，我们车间工人在“老兵拿新枪，老厂换新装”的战斗口号鼓舞下，不仅基本上实现了生产操作上的机械化和半机械化，而且还要美化车间，决心要把锚链的检查和修整过程，放到地底下进行，使锚链工段成为“地下”的工段，在地下工段的上面，修起花园。
    原来我们车间整修锚链，不论是刮风下雨、冰天雪地，工人都在露天地里劳动。锚链很重、很长，拖来拖去很不方便，还时常发生拖绳绞断碰伤工人的事情，生产很不安全。特别突出的问题是：我们工厂是一个老厂，生产发展很快，各方面需要我们生产锚链的数量很大，这就需要占据大量的作业面积，但场地有限，到处摆的都是锚链，在锚链工段走起路来都没法插脚。工人同志决心要改变这种生产面貌，敢想敢干，挖成地道，把整个整修锚链的过程搬到地底下去进行，改变了作业面积不足，劳动条件差和生产不安全的状况，实现了机械化生产，还准备安上避音器减少嗓音。在地下工段的上面栽起苹果树，插上葡萄秧，修起养鱼池，盖上凉亭避阴凉，使它成为工人业余很好的学习、休息、娱乐的场所。青年人说：“地下是工段，地上是花园，往后谈恋爱，不用到公园”。这样既实现了生产过程的机械化，又美化了车间，一举两得，从根本上改变了车间的面貌。
    普开革新花，遍结跃进果
    工人说：“技术改造闹得欢，生产指标直上天”。一点也不错，我们车间自大搞技术改造以来，生产真是日新月异，月月超，步步高，而且作到了增产又减人。以2月份为例：劳动力比去年2月减少了37％，但是产值比去年2月提高了122.8％，劳动生产率为去年同期的345％。1月份比去年12月平均日产值提高了17.1％，2月又比1月提高了30.3％，3月预计比2月提高21.2％。产品质量也大大提高了，今年1、2月废品率平均为1.7％，比去年降低1.96％。是什么力量能使我们有这么大的劲，取得这样成绩呢？工人的结论是：
    三面红旗高空扬，
    攻克困难如反掌，
    英明领导共产党，
    轻舟冲破万重浪，
    歌颂领袖毛主席，
    千功万绩归于党。
    我们车间能够在最短的时间内实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，是和厂内外大搞三结合分不开的。在工作中，东北工学院、大连工学院，以及各兄弟工厂都给了我们大力支援。现在我们车间正向自动化迈进。我们深信，在党的领导下，鼓足更大干劲，完全可以在最短的时间内，把我们车间武装成现代化的新型车间。
