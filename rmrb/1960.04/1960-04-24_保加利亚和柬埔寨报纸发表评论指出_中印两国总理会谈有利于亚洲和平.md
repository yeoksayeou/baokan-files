Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 22nd. Bulgarian newspapers "Otechestven Front" and "Zemedelsko Zname" published commentaries on the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers.

    The "Otechestven Front" commentary on the 22nd said that the undefined border between India and China is a phenomenon left over from imperialist rule. The commentary pointed out that the meeting between the two Prime Ministers in Delhi is of positive significance for the development of relations between the two countries and the consolidation of peace in Asia.

    The commentary condemned some reactionary and pro-American newspapers in India for deliberately widening the differences between India and China and maintaining tension in Asia and the world.

    The "Zemedelsko Zname" published a commentary on the 19th, saying that the border dispute that the two Prime Ministers should resolve is a legacy of foreign imperialism. Now, when there is a possibility of eliminating this artificial dispute, imperialism will never be reconciled.

    The commentary condemned the leadership group of the Indian "People's Socialist Party" for inciting anti-China and anti-communist sentiment. The commentary said that it is well known that this party openly pursues a pro-American policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 23rd. Cambodian newspapers praised China's sincerity towards the Sino-Indian talks and its correct attitude of demanding a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue, and strongly hoped that the Sino-Indian talks would achieve satisfactory results.

    The Cambodian "People's Daily" quoted Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to foreign reporters at the Yangon airport in today's editorial, saying that he went to India with confidence to solve the problem with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The newspaper pointed out that this correct attitude and his statement of strongly hoping to peacefully resolve the Sino-Indian border issue were universally welcomed by the masses and public opinion.

    The newspaper said that the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Myanmar Border Agreement once again illustrated the value of the Five Principles, and at the same time, they further convinced the people of all countries of the People's Republic of China's genuine sincerity in hoping for peace. The newspaper quoted a commentary from a Myanmar newspaper saying that the Sino-Myanmar Treaty and Agreement could be signed because of the sincere spirit of the Chinese leaders and their desire to coexist with Myanmar in friendship and peace.

    The newspaper said that imperialism never stops trying to undermine the Sino-Indian talks. Even on the same day that Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru held talks, imperialism incited the reactionary forces in India to hold demonstrations demanding that Prime Minister Nehru take a "firm stance."

    The newspaper said, however, that the Indian people earnestly hope for peace and friendship. They hope that Sino-Indian relations will further develop.

    The newspaper pointed out that if the Sino-Indian talks achieve good results, it will not only benefit the Chinese and Indian people but also be conducive to peace in the Far East and Southeast Asia. These results will be a major blow to the warmongers and encourage the people of Asia and Africa to advance along the road of peaceful coexistence.

    The newspaper also said that the Cambodian people wish the Sino-Indian talks success and wish the sincere friendship between the two countries to become more and more consolidated and developed.

    "Motherland" newspaper published a commentary today, hoping that the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers will be successful in order to contribute to the lasting unity of the Asian people. The newspaper pointed out that the Sino-Indian border dispute is a very complex problem left over by colonialism. It said that the fact that the Prime Ministers of China and India can hold talks is a victory for the peaceful resolution of the dispute. It is believed that the idea of peace and friendship will triumph over the idea of attempting to split the Asian-African family.
