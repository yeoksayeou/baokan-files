Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 8th: The Soviet delegation issued a statement at the ten-nation disarmament committee meeting on the 8th, stating that during the four weeks of discussions on complete and thorough disarmament, the delegations of various countries had not yet reached a convergence in their positions that would allow them to begin drafting specific articles of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. The delegations of Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia believe that in order for the Disarmament Committee's work to progress and achieve the objectives set forth in the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 20, 1959, it is necessary to begin formulating the basic principles of complete and thorough disarmament and to formulate a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament based on these principles.

The statement said that the Soviet delegation, entrusted by the delegations of socialist countries, had submitted "Basic Principles of Complete and Thorough Disarmament" for discussion by the committee. The statement said that the principles on which the realization of complete and thorough disarmament is based (and the formulation of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament should also be based on these principles) are:

    I. Complete and thorough disarmament includes the dissolution of all armed forces, the destruction of all weapons, the cessation of all types of military production, the dismantling of all foreign bases on foreign territories, the withdrawal and disbandment of foreign troops from these territories, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and rocket weapons, the cessation of the production and storage of such weapons, the abolition of national organs and institutions used to organize the military (general staffs, military ministries, and their local organs), the prohibition of military training, the abolition of military schools, and the cessation of military appropriations.

    II. Complete and thorough disarmament shall be carried out in stages according to an agreed sequence and completed within a strictly agreed timeframe of four years.

    III. The measures stipulated in the complete and thorough disarmament plan shall be implemented under international supervision, the scope of which shall correspond to the scope and nature of the disarmament measures at each stage. In order to organize the supervision and inspection of disarmament, an international control body shall be established, taking into account all countries, and this body shall act in accordance with the special provisions that form part of the disarmament treaty.

    IV. After the completion of the complete and thorough disarmament plan, each country shall only retain strictly limited police forces (militia) equipped with light weapons, as unanimously agreed upon, whose duties shall be solely to maintain internal order and protect the personal safety of citizens.

    V. Countries should not interrupt the implementation of the complete and thorough disarmament plan or make it dependent on any condition not stipulated in the treaty.

If a country attempts to evade or violate the treaty on complete and thorough disarmament, the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations should immediately discuss the issue of such violation in order to take measures, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, to sanction the violator.

The statement said that as an act of good faith and in order to create appropriate conditions for the speedy conclusion of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament, member states of the committee possessing nuclear weapons should solemnly declare that they will not be the first to use nuclear weapons.

    苏联代表团发表裁军声明
    提出实现全面彻底裁军的基本原则
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表团8日在十国裁军委员会会议上发表声明说，在讨论全面彻底裁军的四个星期的过程中，各国代表团在立场方面还没有达到这样的接近，从而使它们现在能够着手拟定全面彻底裁军条约的具体条款。保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为，为了使裁军委员会的工作取得进展，以达到联合国大会1959年11月20日决议提出的目的，必须着手制定全面彻底裁军的基本原则，并应根据这些原则制定全面彻底裁军的条约。
    声明说，苏联代表团受社会主义国家各代表团的委托，曾提出“全面彻底裁军的基本原则”交委员会讨论。声明说，实现全面彻底裁军所依据的原则（制定全面彻底裁军条约也应根据这些原则）是：
    一、全面彻底裁军包括解散一切武装部队、销毁一切武器、停止一切类型的军事生产、撤销在别国领土上的一切外国基地、从这些领土上撤出外国军队并予以解散、禁止核武器、化学武器、细菌武器和火箭武器、停止这种武器的生产和贮存这种武器、撤销各国用来组织军事的机关和机构（总参谋、军事部和它们的地方机构）、禁止军事训练、取消军事学校和停止军事拨款。
    二、全面彻底裁军根据商定的次序分阶段进行，并且在严格约定的期限——四年内完成。
    三、全面彻底裁军计划所规定的各项措施在国际监督下执行，国际监督的范围应当符合每一阶段的裁军措施的范围和性质。为了组织对裁军的监督和视察。建立一个考虑到所有国家的国际监督机构，这个机构将根据作为裁军条约组成部分的特别条款行事。
    四、在全面彻底裁军计划完成以后，每个国家只能留有严格限制的大家一致同意的配备轻武器的警察（民警），其职责只是维持内部秩序和保护公民的个人安全。
    五、各国在贯彻全面彻底裁军计划时不应当中断，也不应当使它取决于条约所没有规定的某种条款。
    如果某国企图逃避和破坏全面彻底裁军条约，那么安全理事会和联合国大会就应当立即讨论这种破坏的问题，以便根据联合国宪章的条款采取措施来制裁破坏者。
    声明说，作为诚意的行动和为了建立适当的条件来尽速缔结全面彻底裁军条约，拥有核武器的委员会成员国应该郑重宣布自己不第一个使用核武器。
