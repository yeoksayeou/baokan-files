Fellow Delegates:

    I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, thanks to adhering to the general line of socialist construction, adhering to the high-speed development of the Great Leap Forward, adhering to the People's Communes, and deeply carrying out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in 1959, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.

    In 1959, the construction of the Baotou industrial base, centered around Baotou Steel, also achieved a continuous Great Leap Forward under the situation of the Great Leap Forward nationwide and in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire workforce, farmers, and intellectuals of Baotou City, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, enthusiastically responded to the Party's call at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, over fulfilling the 1959 national economic construction plan one month ahead of schedule, and achieving a great victory on the production and construction front. The construction of the Baotou industrial base has further accelerated construction conditions, enabling the Baotou industrial base to enter a new stage of simultaneous basic construction and production.

    Following the commissioning of the No. 1 large blast furnace one year ahead of schedule, Baotou Steel's construction work is continuing with greater enthusiasm on a large scale of basic construction and has entered a new period of large-scale construction and large-scale production simultaneously. In 1959, basic construction completed 118.3% of the state plan, equivalent to twice the amount of work completed in 1958. Production capacity increased sixty-two times in 1959 compared to 1958, over fulfilling the 1959 national plan by 104%.

    Now I will report to the conference on the work of the Baotou Steel Design Institute:

    The Baotou Steel Design Institute completed the design tasks for Baotou Steel and several provinces and regions' small and medium-sized steel plants in three quarters of last year. This year, in the first quarter, the 1960 design tasks were completed nine months ahead of schedule, achieving unprecedentedly higher speeds and an unprecedentedly greater leap forward. Further accelerating the task of Baotou Steel's construction first requires improving the level of design work and accelerating the design speed. In design work, drawing, tracing, and calculation account for a large proportion. These tasks have always been manual and individual labor, using a lot of manpower and taking a long time. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the speed of basic construction has developed rapidly. How to take revolutionary measures in design methods and design tools to accelerate the design speed is the requirement of the vast number of design workers. After two years of effort, many advanced methods and tools have been created. Since January of this year, the entire institute has launched a design revolution movement centered on technical revolution and technical innovation. All employees—from senior engineers to technicians to tracers and blueprint operators—have boldly broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, and boldly created, and implemented a method of combining learning with originality. They learned from each other and inspired each other within the institute, and also vigorously organized learning from the experiences of fraternal design institutes, such as participating in the on-site conference for the experience matching of the Anshan Coking and Refractory Design Institute, and immediately launched a large-scale design experience matching movement throughout the institute. They visited Xi'an Institute of Technology and Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute. A wave of calculation electrification has formed throughout the institute. Every department, every group, and even every individual is using the principle of resistance simulation, combined with their own calculation work, to research and create their own electrical circuits to solve their own calculation formulas. Everyone creates and experiments as they go, preparing materials and finding parts themselves. If they can't find parts, they try every means to borrow them. Some comrades dismantled the parts of their own radios for experiments. The enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the masses are unprecedentedly high. In just a few weeks, more than twenty kinds of electrical calculation equipment and hundreds of various simple calculation equipment, such as slide rules and charts for solving specific problems, have been created, greatly reducing the workload of design calculation.

    In the "Experience Matching" work, the Baotou Steel Design Institute summarized, sorted, and matched various experiences created in the red flag emulation, technical performances, and technical innovations over the past few years, as well as the design achievements accumulated in the past few years, into sets as a mass movement. Everyone in the institute rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and in a short period of time, from the complete set of drawings for the entire workshop to the drawings of individual equipment components, from the experience of design management to the operating methods of tracing and printing, and even design budget matching, were quickly sorted out and matched into more than 13,000 sets of varying sizes. Using these complete sets of materials for selection and assembly, supplementing and modifying them according to local conditions, generally speaking, qualified drawings can be submitted without complex design, greatly reducing the design workload and accelerating the design speed.

    In February of this year, through the technical innovation movement of making design drawings printable, the masses created the use of wax paper (or cellophane) to create printable forms, basically eliminating the cumbersome process of drawing and tracing with T-squares and triangles. It is no longer necessary to repeatedly draw many drawings that have different overall forms but are composed of the same units. Use printable units to assemble the designed pattern, fix it on cellophane, print it into a second negative, and then add dimensions and some small supplements and changes to the second negative before printing the finished product. This makes the drawing clear and neat, saves labor, and produces quickly. Because the work is faster, there is more time to check, which improves quality. More importantly, most tracers directly participate in design work after adjusting the labor organization, which greatly encourages the enthusiasm of designers.

    All of the above technical revolutions and technical innovations have accelerated the design speed and improved quality. This frees the design institute from tedious and repetitive manual labor, making it possible to spend more time on site, absorb new achievements in production and construction, study them, apply them to design, and promote them. It is also possible to engage in scientific experiment and research work, thereby improving our design level and creating more advanced designs for the Great Leap Forward that are more suitable for national conditions. The great revolution and great leap forward of design work have driven the cultural and sports activities of the entire institute, such as labor training, running farms, etc. This guideline has brought up the work of the entire institute.

    The communist consciousness of the vast number of employees is constantly improving under the Party's continuous education and encouragement. This is a guarantee for completing design tasks faster and better. The style of "giving convenience and leaving difficulties" has been greatly promoted. Among the various design departments, groups, and individuals, they actively create conditions for each other, or actively cooperate with construction and production departments to solve design, equipment material substitution, and other issues in construction and production. Process designers actively go to fraternal departments to understand the situation and help solve problems that occur in the design process in a timely manner. Some increased the design data from one copy to four copies to reduce repetitive labor by allowing fraternal departments to cut, paste, and reuse them. After the various professional departments and groups complete their design tasks, they actively draw out forces to support the departments and groups that have not yet completed their tasks, helping to overcome weak links, so that the entire project can be completed quickly and comprehensively.

    Through the Party's education and training and the political movements over the years, the political awareness of all employees has been greatly improved. The three red flags of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as the Party issues instructions and calls, it will immediately receive a warm response from the masses. The Party organization frequently proposes new tasks in a timely manner along with the development and changes in the design work situation, leading the masses from one victory to another. At the beginning of this year, all employees of the institute conscientiously summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. Through mass summarization, they enhanced the masses' continuous revolutionary will. On this basis, they launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement, proposing the slogan "Complete one month's task ten days in advance, basically complete the design of two major Baotou Steel projects by the end of the month." They held a mobilization meeting and launched a dragon-like competition centered on the design of these two projects, bringing production to a new peak. On the basis of continuously over fulfilling the plans for January and February, they completed the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule. The creative enthusiasm of the vast number of employees is increasing day by day. Under these circumstances, the Party organization put forward the slogan "Complete the annual plan in half a year." All employees of the institute are high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. The entire institute is matching experiences into a dragon, and the technical revolution is flourishing. Especially through the study of socialist education, the understanding of the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes has become more profound. Mao Zedong Thought is exerting its great power in work. Everyone is in high spirits and their minds are liberated. A new leap forward situation has emerged. The entire institute has universally adopted design matching, printable design, tabulation, slide rule calculation, and adjusted the labor organization, further promoting the development of productive forces, making the annual design plan repeatedly advanced, and finally comprehensively and victoriously completing the annual task of 1960 in the first quarter.

    All these examples prove that once Chairman Mao's ideological weapon is grasped by the masses, it will exert unparalleled great power. Our design work insists on putting politics in command, studying Chairman Mao's works, continuously improving the level of political thought, using the three major magic weapons, taking the mass line, breaking superstitions, liberating our minds, vigorously promoting the style of collaboration, we will certainly be able to further improve the design level, advance at high speed, ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the national plan tasks, and move from victory to greater victory.

    Please criticize and correct any inappropriateness in the above speech.

    高速度前进的包钢设计工作
    谭振雄代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，并完全同意人大常委会的工作报告。全国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，由于坚持了社会主义建设总路线，坚持了大跃进的发展速度，坚持了人民公社，深入地开展了增产节约的群众运动，在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年继续实现了大跃进，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    1959年以包钢为中心的包头工业基地建设在全国和内蒙古自治区大跃进的形势下，也实现了继续大跃进。包头市的全体职工、农民、知识分子，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，热烈地响应了党的八届八中全会反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的号召，提前一个月超额完成了1959年的国民经济建设计划，取得了生产建设战线上的巨大胜利。包头工业基地有了进一步加快建设的条件，从而使包头工业基地进入了一个基本建设和生产同时并进的新阶段。
    包钢建设工作在一号大型高炉提前一年投入生产之后，正以更大的干劲继续进行大规模的基本建设，并且转入了大规模建设和大规模生产同时并进的新时期。1959年基本建设完成国家计划的118.3％，相当于1958年完成的工程量的两倍。生产能力，1959年比1958年增长了六十二倍，超额完成1959年国家计划104％。
    现在我把包钢设计院工作情况向大会汇报一下：
    包钢设计院去年以三个季度的时间完成1959年包钢以及几个省区的中小型钢铁厂的设计任务，进一步在今年第一季度把1960年的设计任务提前了九个月胜利完成，达到前所未有的更高速度，实现前所未有的更大跃进。进一步加快包钢建设的任务首先要求提高设计工作水平，加快设计速度。设计工作中绘图，描图，计算工作，占很大比重。这些工作一向是手工的个体的劳动，用人多占时间长。自1958年大跃进以来，基本建设施工速度飞快发展，设计工作怎样在设计方法上，设计工具上采取革命的办法加快设计速度，这是广大设计工作人员的要求。经过两年的努力，创造了不少的先进方法和工具。今年1月以来全院开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的设计大革命运动，全体职工——从老工程师到技术员以至描图员、晒图员，大胆破除迷信，解放思想，大胆进行创造，并且贯彻学习与独创相结合的方法，院内相互学习相互启发，还大力组织学习各兄弟设计院的经验。如参加鞍山焦化耐火设计院经验配套的现场会议，并即开展了全院的设计经验大配套运动。参观了西安工学院，沈阳铝镁设计院，全院形成了一个计算电气化的热潮，院内每个科每个组以至每个人都开动脑筋用电阻模拟的原理，结合个人的计算工作，研究创造自己的电气线路，解决自己的计算公式。大家随创造随试验，自己去备料找零件，找不到零件，千方百计去借，有的同志拆下自己的无线电的零件来试验。群众的热情，积极性和创造性空前高涨，在短短的几星期的时间内创造了电气计算设备二十多种，各种简捷的计算设备，如解决专门问题的算尺，图表等等上百种，大大的减少设计计算的工作量。
    包钢设计院在“经验大配套”工作中，把几年来红旗竞赛、技术表演和技术革新创造出来的各种各样经验和过去几年积累的设计成果归纳整理搭配成套作为群众性运动开展之后，全院每个人翻箱倒柜，在短短的时间内，从整个车间的完整全套图纸到部件单体设备构件图纸，从设计管理的经验到描晒印制的操作方法，甚至于设计预算配套，很快地就整理好并配成了大小不等的一万三千多套。利用这些成套的材料加以选择拼装，因地制宜加以补充修改，一般地不再用复杂的设计就可交出合乎要求的图纸，大大地减少了设计的工作量，加快了设计的速度。
    今年2月，经过设计图纸活版化的技术革新运动，群众创造了使用腊纸（或是玻璃纸）拼活版，基本上消灭了用丁字尺、三角板制图描图的繁琐工序，不必再重复地画很多总的形式不同但组成的单元是一样的图纸。用活版单元拼出所设计的图样，固定在玻璃纸上，晒成二底图，在二底图上再加注尺寸以及一些小的补充添改之后，就可晒制成品。这样做图面清楚整洁，用工省，出品快，由于工作快了，有更多时间核校，提高了质量。更重要的是大部分描图员经过调整劳动组织直接参加设计工作，个个兴高采烈，进一步大大鼓舞了设计人员的积极性。
    所有以上的技术革命和技术革新，加快了设计的速度，提高了质量。使设计院从繁琐的重复的手工劳动解放出来，因而有可能用更多的时间下现场，吸收生产和施工方面新的成就，加以研究，应用到设计中加以推广，亦有可能搞科学试验研究工作，从而提高我们的设计水平，创造更适合国情的大跃进的先进设计。设计工作大革命大跃进，带动了全院的文化、体育，如劳动锻炼，办农场等等活动，通过这一条纲把全院的工作带了起来。
    广大职工的共产主义觉悟，在党的不断教育和鼓励下，不断提高，这是更好的更高速度的完成设计任务的保证。“让方便，留困难”的风气大大发扬，在各设计科之间，各组与个人之间，互相主动创造条件，或主动与施工和生产部门协作解决施工中和生产中的设计、设备材料代用……等等问题。工艺设计人主动到兄弟科了解情况，及时帮助解决在设计过程中发生的问题。有的将设计资料由一份增加到四份，以便兄弟科剪贴复用减少重复劳动，各专业科、组完成设计任务之后，主动抽出力量支援尚未完成任务的科组，帮助克服薄弱环节，使整个工程很快的全面完成。
    全院职工经过党的教育培养和历年的政治运动，政治觉悟有了很大的提高，党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗深入人心，只要党发出指示和号召，立即得到群众的热烈响应，党组织经常随着设计工作形势的发展与变化，适时地提出新任务。领导群众从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。今年一开始全院职工认真总结了1959年大跃进的经验，通过群众性的总结，增强了群众的不断革命意志，在这个基础上开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，提出“一月任务提前十天完，包钢二个大工程设计月底基本完”的口号。开了誓师大会，开展了以这二个工程设计为中心的一条龙竞赛，使生产跃上新的高峰。在连续超额完成元月、2月份计划的基础上，提前完成一季计划任务。广大职工的创造积极性日益高涨，在这情况下，党组织提出了“一年计划半年完”的口号，全院职工斗志昂扬，全院经验配套成龙，技术革命蓬勃开展，特别是通过社会主义教育的学习，对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗认识更加深刻，毛泽东思想在工作中发挥出它巨大的威力，人人精神振奋，思想解放，出现了新的跃进形势，全院普遍采用了设计配套，活版设计、表格化、算尺化，调整了劳动组织，进一步促进了生产力的发展，使全年的设计计划任务一再提前，终于在第一季度全面胜利完成1960年的全年任务。
    这一切事例证明了毛主席思想武器，一旦为群众所掌握，就会发挥无比巨大的威力。我们设计工作坚持政治挂帅，学习毛主席的著作，不断提高政治思想水平，运用三大法宝，大走群众路线，大破迷信，解放思想，大兴协作之风，一定能进一步提高设计水平，高速度前进，保证完成和超额完成国家计划任务，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    以上发言，不妥之处请批评指正。
