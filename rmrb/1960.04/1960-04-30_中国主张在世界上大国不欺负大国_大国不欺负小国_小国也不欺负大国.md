Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th April: At a reception given by the Nepal-China Friendship Association in honor of Premier Zhou Enlai on the evening of April 28th, Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized in his speech that China advocates that in the world, large countries should not bully large countries, large countries should not bully small countries, and small countries should not bully large countries.

At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister B.P. Koirala, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and leaders of the Nepal-China Friendship Association all spoke with pleasure about the long-standing friendship between China and Nepal, and expressed their firm belief that this friendship would be further strengthened.

It was a pleasant gathering. Many members of the Nepal-China Friendship Association attended, including parliamentarians, scholars, poets, business people, workers, and students. The reception was filled with an atmosphere of brotherly affection.

Purna Bahadur, President of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, praised the constantly strengthening and increasingly close friendship between Nepal and China in his speech. He said, "As a member of the Asian family, Nepal is proud to have your kind friendship and is proud of the achievements of your country's development." He also said, "No opposition can destroy this friendship between our two countries. Neither the ocean nor the mountains can separate us."

Prime Minister Koirala, when talking about China's rapid economic development, said that the people of Nepal can also build their own country like the hardworking people of China. He said that this reception shows the increasing friendship between the two countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai, amid cheers, quoted a Chinese proverb, "Let the friendship between China and Nepal last as long as the high mountains and the ever-flowing green waters. The friendship between the two countries is like the Himalayas, connecting the hearts of the two peoples." Premier Zhou suggested that Vice Premier Chen Yi express the Chinese people's warm feelings towards the Nepalese people. When introducing Vice Premier Chen Yi to the attendees, Premier Zhou said that he was a Marshal and also a poet.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly praised the growing and profound friendship between China and Nepal. He said that when imperialism and foreign reactionaries attempted to interfere in China's internal affairs in Tibet, the Kingdom of Nepal and its people adhered to their friendship with China and did not interfere in China's internal affairs, for which we express our heartfelt thanks.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that in recent years, the mutual visits between the Premiers and Prime Ministers of the two countries have been warmly welcomed. This proves that the friendship between the two countries is increasing and mutually friendly. He said that the relationship between countries is like the relationship between two friends, which needs to be tested by time and facts in order to better establish mutual trust. He continued, "Today, some foreign friends are somewhat uneasy about China, and we do not blame them. We are willing to make contributions in the long term, in fact, to eliminate this distrust. The consolidation and development of Sino-Nepalese friendship in recent years is a good proof. Let our two countries, China and Nepal, be friendly forever for hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of years."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that China advocates that in the world, large countries should not bully large countries, large countries should not bully small countries, and small countries should not bully large countries. He said, "Let's unite the world into a peaceful and coexisting family." He especially thanked Nepal for not bullying China. He also said, "The Kingdom of Nepal adopts a friendly policy towards all countries in the world. You have fought bravely for many years to maintain your independence and have defeated the invaders. The Chinese people are deeply impressed by this and express their admiration. You adhere to a policy of peace and neutrality, and your policy is correct. Although you are a small country, you are powerful."

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised Nepal for its fertile land, magnificent mountains and rivers, hardworking people, wise leaders, and the Kingdom's government for connecting with the people. He said that these are the sources of Nepal's strength and the deep impressions we gained from this visit. Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yi shouted in Nepali, "Nepal-China Bai Bai!" At this time, the guests and hosts at the venue shouted with him, and a storm of applause erupted.

This reception was more like a family gathering than a reception. At the meeting, Nepalese girls performed farmers' dances and folk songs, and the guests and hosts exchanged gifts with enthusiastic words, and laughter and cheers showed a warm feeling of kinship. Premier Zhou presented the Nepal-China Friendship Association with a large Chinese painting and a Chinese-made radio, while Nepalese friends also returned many gifts, including a bronze Buddha statue, paintings by artists themselves, and poems written by poets themselves.

When the Chinese guests said goodbye, the hosts were reluctant to leave them, and the masses waiting on the street outside cheered endlessly to bid farewell to Premier Zhou.

    中国主张在世界上大国不欺负大国  大国不欺负小国  小国也不欺负大国
    周总理、柯伊拉腊首相和尼中友协领导人等热情颂扬中尼友谊
    新华社加德满都28日电　陈毅副总理28日晚上在尼泊尔—中国友好协会为周恩来总理举行的招待会上发表讲话时强调说，中国主张，在世界上大国不欺负大国，大国也不欺负小国，而小国也不欺负大国。
    在招待会上，周恩来总理，毕·普·柯伊拉腊首相，陈毅副总理和尼泊尔—中国友好协会的领导人，都以愉快的心情谈到中尼两国之间的悠久友谊，并且表示深信，这种友谊将进一步加强。
    这是一个愉快的聚会。出席的有许多尼泊尔—中国友好协会的会员，其中包括议员、学者、诗人、工商界人士、工人和学生。招待会上洋溢着兄弟情谊的气氛。
    尼泊尔—中国友好协会会长普尔纳·巴哈杜尔在讲话中盛赞不断加强的和日益密切的尼中友谊。他说，“尼泊尔作为亚洲大家庭的一员，以得到你们的亲切友谊，并以你们国家发展的成就而感到自豪。”他还说，“任何反对的人都不能破坏我们两国之间的这种友谊。海洋和高山都不能使我们分开。”
    柯伊拉腊首相在谈到中国迅速的经济发展时说，尼泊尔人民也能够像勤劳的中国人民一样建设自己的国家。他说，这个招待会表明了两国之间的日益增进的友谊。
    周恩来总理在欢呼声中引用了一句中国的成语说，“让中尼友谊像高山和长流的绿水一样万古长存。两国的友谊就像连结着两国人民的心的喜马拉雅山。”周总理建议陈毅副总理表达中国人民对尼泊尔人民的热烈的感情。周总理在向到会的人介绍陈毅副总理的时候，说他是一位元帅，同时又是一位诗人。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中热情地颂扬中尼日益发展的深厚友谊。他说，当帝国主义和外国反动分子企图干涉中国领土西藏内政时，尼泊尔王国政府和人民坚持了对中国的友谊和不干涉中国的内政，我们对此表示衷心的感谢。
    陈毅副总理指出，几年来，两国总理和首相相互进行的访问，都受到了隆重热烈的欢迎。这证明了两国友谊日益增强，互相友好。他说，世界上国与国之间的关系和两个朋友的关系一样，需要经过时间和事实的考验，才能更好地建立起彼此之间的信任。他接着说，今天，部分外国朋友对中国有些不放心，我们并不见怪。我们愿意在长时期内，在事实上作出贡献，来消除这种不信任。几年来，中尼友谊日益巩固和发展就是很好的证明。让我们中尼两国几百年、几千年、几万年永远友好下去。
    陈毅副总理说，中国主张，在世界上大国不欺负大国，大国也不欺负小国，而小国也不欺负大国。他说，把世界联合成一个和平共处的大家庭吧。他特别感谢尼泊尔不欺负中国。他又说，尼泊尔王国对世界各国采取友好政策。“你们多少年来为保持自己的独立，进行了英勇地奋斗，打败了侵略者。中国人民对此有深刻的印象，并且表示钦佩。你们坚持和平中立政策，你们的政策是正确的。你们虽然是小国，但是你们是强大的。”
    陈毅副总理赞扬尼泊尔土地富饶，山川雄壮，人民勤劳，领袖明智，王国政府联系人民。他说，这些都是尼泊尔力量的源泉，也是我们这次访问所获得的深刻印象。陈毅副总理最后用尼泊尔语言欢呼“尼泊尔秦尼巴依巴依！”这时会场上的宾主同他一起欢呼，并且响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    这个招待会与其说是一个招待会，不如说是一个家庭聚会。在会上，尼泊尔姑娘们表演了农民舞和民歌，宾主之间用热情的言词互相赠送礼物，笑声和欢呼声显示出热烈的亲戚感情。周总理送给尼泊尔—中国友好协会一大幅中国的国画和一架中国制造的无线电收音机，同时，尼泊尔朋友们也回赠了许多礼物，其中有一尊铜制佛像，艺术家自己画的画和诗人自己作的诗句。
    当中国客人们告别时，主人们都不愿意同他们离开，等在外面街上的群众用经久不息的欢呼声来欢送周总理。
