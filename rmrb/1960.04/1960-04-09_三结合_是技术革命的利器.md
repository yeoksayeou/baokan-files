In his report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out: "From countless historical facts, it can be seen that experts and technicians can reform old technologies and create new technologies, and ordinary laborers with practical production experience can also, and even more so, reform old technologies and create new technologies. The close combination of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, working together with one heart and mind, and making every effort, will surely create miracles in technology."

The current technological innovation and revolution movement shows that many major projects can be successful in a very short period of time, not by relying solely on one person's pondering, but by relying on collective strength and after collective research; it is achieved under the leadership of the Party by implementing the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel. Widely promoting the "three combinations" is a concrete manifestation of implementing the Party's mass line in the technological innovation and revolution movement, and it is an important method to guide this movement onto the correct, scientific, and mass-based track.

"Three combinations" is a Marxist-Leninist working method of combining leadership with the masses, theory with practice, and politics with technology, summarized during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The work of leading cadres has a significant impact on the success or failure of enterprise production, but if leading cadres do not combine with the broad masses, no matter how great their talents, they cannot do things well. Technical personnel have more scientific and technological knowledge, but if their scientific and technological knowledge is not combined with production practice, it will be difficult to realistically guide the development of production; not only will it be difficult for technical personnel to improve politically, but their scientific and technological level will also be difficult to improve. The working masses directly participate in production practice, have a high level of political awareness, have the deepest understanding of the production process, the clearest understanding of production potential, and can also put forward the most practical and effective suggestions for reforming various major issues in production; however, if the workers' enthusiasm for production and the creativity for reforming production do not have the support of the leadership, do not have the political and ideological leadership of the leading cadres, and if the workers' production experience and suggestions for reforming production do not have the help of technical personnel and cannot be scientifically and theoretically identified and summarized, then the huge role of the working masses in production will also be limited. Implementing the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, combining the strength of the leadership with the strength of the masses, and combining the scientific and technological knowledge of technical personnel with the practical experience of the working masses, that is, combining theory and practice, can organize the positive factors in all aspects of the enterprise and bring them to bear on the development of production to a greater extent.

The process of implementing the "three combinations" is also a process for all employees of the enterprise, including leading cadres, to conduct self-education, correctly resolve the relationship between politics and technology, and implement political command and the combination of politics and technology. Correctly understanding the relationship between politics and technology is a fundamental issue in enterprise work. The process of implementing the "three combinations," for leading cadres, is the process of implementing the Party's policies and guidelines among the masses and concentrating the experience of the masses, overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism, better connecting with the masses and connecting with reality, and realizing concrete leadership; for technical personnel, it is the process of training themselves to be both red and expert, and it is the process of first becoming students of the workers and then becoming teachers of the workers; for the working masses, it is a process of further stimulating their sense of ownership, and further exerting their awareness, initiative, and creativity in building socialism. In short, whether for leading cadres, technical personnel, or the working masses, implementing the "three combinations" is not just a change in working methods, but first and foremost a change in thinking, combining politics and technology, with politics commanding technology, so that all enterprise employees, including leading cadres, move toward the path of being both red and expert.

It is precisely because the implementation of the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel has a huge and profound effect on changing the ideological outlook and production outlook of enterprises. Over the past two years, the "three combinations" have become an important method of organizing industrial production that is universally implemented. Especially in the mass movement to carry out the technological revolution, the huge and profound role of implementing the "three combinations" is even more prominent. The technological revolution is a revolution in the productive forces. The rapid development of this revolution requires reforms in the relations of production that are compatible with it. Implementing the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel is a further adjustment of the relationship between people in the enterprise. We know that the relationship between people is an important aspect of the relations of production. In socialist enterprises, due to the different positions of each person in the production process; especially because many of the enterprise's technical personnel still come from the bourgeoisie, or are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, and have not been completely reformed; and many cadres are still influenced by the ideological habits of the old society, there are still contradictory phenomena in the relationship between people. If this contradiction is not well resolved, it will also be a constraint on the development of the productive forces. For example, leading cadres not supporting workers' suggestions for technological innovation, and technical personnel taking a discouraging attitude towards workers' inventions and creations, can all be attributed to the constraints of the relations of production on the productive forces. Implementing the "three combinations," correcting the relationship between leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel into a comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation, and further coordinating the relationship between the leadership and the masses, as well as the relationship between workers and technical personnel, can have a greater counter-effect on the development of the productive forces. Without this major change in the relations of production, the rapid development of the productive forces will be limited.

At present, the technological innovation and revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is developing extremely rapidly, and continuing to implement the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel has become an even more prominent issue. This movement is a mass movement, and its spearhead is not directed at the technical reform of individual types of work or individual processes, but at all backward and weak links in the entire production process; it includes not only mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, but also the development of new products, continuous innovation in technology and tools, reasonable saving and substitution, and comprehensive utilization of raw materials and materials, as well as actively improving enterprise management, improving labor organization and production organization, etc., so that the production outlook of our entire country is changing with each passing day. Such a huge task cannot be accomplished by relying solely on the strength of a part of the people. Leading cadres must formulate a plan that can change the entire production outlook of the enterprise and quickly put it into practice, and must better combine with the masses and rely on the strength of the masses to reform the production outlook. Workers and technical personnel must also better combine with the leadership, understand the overall picture of production, and obtain the support and assistance of the leadership in order to play a greater role in the huge task of changing the entire production and technical outlook of the enterprise. In this movement, attacking the cutting edge, climbing peaks, and mastering the most advanced technological achievements are also becoming increasingly urgent tasks. This huge task cannot be accomplished by relying solely on the strength of a part of the people, and it is necessary to better organize the enthusiasm and creativity of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, and give play to collective wisdom. It can be seen that with the development of the technological innovation and revolution movement, implementing the "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel has become an even more pressing need.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the spirit of the Chinese people has been even more invigorated, and their morale has been even higher. People have more common language in the common struggle to conquer backward technologies and invent and create, and have established a deeper comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. We believe that the leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel of every enterprise can better combine together, the technological innovation and revolution movement will surely achieve greater results, and the national economy of our country will surely achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward!

### “三结合”是技术革命的利器

    “三结合”是技术革命的利器
    李富春副总理在关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告中指出：“从无数的历史事实中看到，专家和技术人员可以改革旧技术和创造新技术，有生产实践经验的普通劳动者也可以甚至更可以改革旧技术和创造新技术。领导人员、工人群众、技术人员三者密切结合，同心协力，千方百计，就一定能在技术上创造出奇迹。”
    当前的技术革新和技术革命运动表明，许多重大的项目能够在很短的时间内得到成功，都不是单单依靠哪一个人的琢磨，而是依靠集体的力量，经过集体的研究；是在党的领导下实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”取得的。广泛推行“三结合”，是在技术革新和技术革命运动中贯彻执行党的群众路线的具体化，是把这个运动引向正确的科学的全民的轨道的一个重要方法。
    “三结合”是1958年大跃进中总结出来的领导和群众相结合、理论和实践相结合、政治和技术相结合的马克思列宁主义的工作方法。领导干部的工作对企业生产的好坏有着重大的作用，但是如果领导干部不同广大群众结合起来，不管这些领导干部的才能多大，也不能把事情办好。技术人员有比较多的科学技术知识，但是如果技术人员的科学技术知识不同生产实践相结合，就很难切合实际地指导生产的发展，技术人员不仅政治上很难提高，科学技术水平也很难提高。工人群众直接参加生产实践，政治觉悟高，对于生产过程了解得最深刻，对于生产潜力认识得最清楚，对于改革生产中的各项重大问题也最能提出切实有效的建议；但是，如果工人的生产积极性和改革生产的创造性没有领导的支持，没有领导干部的政治思想领导，如果工人的生产经验和改革生产的建议没有技术人员的帮助，不能从科学上、理论上加以鉴定和概括，那么，工人群众在生产中的巨大作用也会受到限制。实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，把领导的力量和群众的力量结合起来，把技术人员的科学技术知识和工人群众的实践经验，也即是把理论和实践结合起来，就能够把企业中各个方面的积极因素组织起来，更大地作用于生产的发展。
    实行“三结合”的过程，也是包括领导干部在内的企业全体职工进行自我教育，正确地解决政治和技术的关系，实行政治挂帅、政治和技术相结合的过程。正确地认识政治和技术的关系，是企业工作中一个根本性的问题。实行“三结合”的过程，对于领导干部说来，就是把党的政策方针贯彻到群众中去和把群众的经验集中起来的过程，是克服官僚主义、主观主义，更好地联系群众、联系实际，实现具体领导的过程；对于技术人员说来，就是锻炼自己又红又专的过程，是使自己首先当工人的学生、而后又当工人的先生的过程；对于工人群众说来，是一个更加激发主人翁自觉，更加发挥建设社会主义的觉悟性、积极性和创造性的过程。总之，不论是对领导干部，对技术人员，还是对工人群众说来，实行“三结合”都不只是一个工作方法上的变革，而首先是一个思想上的变革，是把政治和技术结合起来，由政治统率技术，使包括领导干部在内的全体企业职工走向又红又专的道路。
    正由于实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，对于改变企业的思想面貌和生产面貌，有着巨大的深刻的作用。两年来，“三结合”已经成为普遍执行的组织工业生产的重要方法。特别是在开展技术革命的群众运动中，实行“三结合”的巨大的深刻的作用表现得更加突出。技术革命是生产力的革命。这个革命的迅速发展，要求生产关系有同它相适应的改革。实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，就是对企业中人与人之间相互关系的进一步的调整。我们知道，人与人之间的关系是生产关系的一个重要方面。在社会主义企业里，由于各人在生产过程中所处的地位的不同；特别是由于企业的技术人员还有不少出身于资产阶级，或者深受资产阶级思想的影响，并没有得到完全的改造；不少干部还受旧社会的思想习惯的影响，因而人与人之间的关系中也还存在着彼此矛盾的现象。这种矛盾不能很好地解决，对于生产力的发展同样是一种束缚。例如，领导干部不支持工人技术革新的建议，技术人员对工人的发明创造采取泼凉水的态度，这都可以归结为生产关系对生产力的束缚。实行“三结合”，把领导干部、工人和技术人员的关系，端正成互助合作的同志式的关系，进一步协调了领导和群众的关系以及工人和技术人员的关系，就能更大地反作用于生产力的发展。没有这种生产关系的重大变革，生产力的迅速发展就会受到限制。
    目前，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动发展极其迅速，继续实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，已经成为一个更加突出的问题。这个运动是一个全民的运动，它的矛头不是指向个别工种、个别工序的技术改革，而是指向全部生产过程中的所有落后的薄弱的环节；它不仅包括机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，而且包括发展新产品，不断革新工艺和工具，合理地节约代用和综合利用原料、材料，以及积极改进企业管理、改善劳动组织和生产组织等等，使我们整个国家生产面貌日新月异。这样巨大的任务，不是仅仅依靠一部分人的力量就能完成的。领导干部要制订一个能够改变整个企业生产面貌的规划，使它迅速付诸实现，必须更好地同群众相结合，依靠群众的力量来改革生产的面貌。工人和技术人员要在改变整个企业生产技术面貌的巨大任务中发挥更大的作用，也必须更好地同领导相结合，了解生产全貌，取得领导的支持和帮助。在这个运动中，攻尖端、攀高峰，掌握最先进的技术成就也愈来愈成为迫切任务。这个巨大的任务，也不是仅仅依靠一部分人的力量就能完成的，必须更好地把领导干部、工人和技术人员的积极性创造性组织起来，发挥集体的智慧。可见，随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，更加成为迫切需要。
    大跃进以来，我国人民的精神更加振奋，意气更加风发，人们在征服落后技术和发明创造的共同斗争中，有了更多的共同语言，建立了更加深厚的同志式的互助合作的关系。我们相信：每一个企业的领导干部、工人和技术人员都能更好地结合起来，技术革新和技术革命运动一定能够取得更大的效果，我国国民经济一定能够实现更好更全面的继续跃进！
