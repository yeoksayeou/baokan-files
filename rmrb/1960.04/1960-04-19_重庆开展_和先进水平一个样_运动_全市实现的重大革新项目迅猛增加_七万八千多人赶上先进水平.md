Chongqing, April 18th (From Our Newspaper) – The broad masses of workers in Chongqing have comprehensively launched a mass movement of "Same as Advanced Level," which has pushed the upsurge of the national technological revolution movement and the competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and assistance to a new stage.

The comprehensive launch of the "Same as" movement has powerfully promoted the technological revolution movement and the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward. In less than a month since the "Same as Movement" was launched, workers in all walks of life, factories, mines, workshops, and groups throughout the city have generally put forward specific goals and formulated plans to catch up with the advanced. These goals and plans include all aspects such as production level, technological innovation, enterprise management, raw material saving, political study, and leadership methods. This has made the competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and assistance not only larger in scale but also more comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous. Taking the machinery industry as an example, since the launch of the "Same as" movement, the industry's 43 major factories, as well as more than 95% of the groups and more than 85% of the individuals in these factories, have comprehensively formulated indicators, plans, and measures to be the same as the national, municipal, and factory-wide advanced levels. After the Chang'an Machine Factory comprehensively launched the ten "Same as" movements, in terms of individual technological innovation, the workers proposed to be the same as Wei Gaohou, a nationally renowned innovation expert; in terms of collective technological innovation, the workshops proposed to be the same as the tool section, which was the first in the factory to achieve automation and consistently achieve high production and high quality; in terms of saving raw materials, the departments proposed to be the same as the first workshop, which tried every means to practice thrift; in terms of cadre style, all cadres in the factory proposed to be the same as the sixth workshop, which consistently went deep into the front line of production and vigorously carried out mass movements in a resolute manner, etc. In this way, almost 100% of the factory's workers were fully involved in the "Same as" movement, creating an unprecedented upsurge of learning, comparing, catching up, and assisting.

Because workers in all walks of life directed the spearhead of the "Same as" movement first and foremost at technological innovation and technological revolution, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement developed faster, bigger, more comprehensively, better, deeper, and more meticulously, pushing the movement to a new peak. In March, the number of semi-mechanized, mechanized, semi-automated, automated, linked, and significant technological innovation projects realized by factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the city all rose rapidly. Among them, the number of semi-mechanized projects implemented reached 12,300, equivalent to 60% of the number implemented before March. The number of mechanized projects implemented reached 9,555, more than double the cumulative number at the end of February. Due to the in-depth development of the "Same as" movement, the ranks of the advanced have continued to expand since March, with more than 78,000 backward individuals catching up to the advanced level. An increasing number of advanced factories, mines, and enterprises with a comprehensive leap forward have emerged on the industrial front. Therefore, a comprehensive leap forward has emerged in all aspects of the city, including production, life, and education. The output of major products such as steel and coal has risen steadily every ten days. In mid-March, steel and coal production increased by 1.37% and 8.4% respectively compared with the first ten days, and increased by 16% and 30.9% respectively in the last ten days compared with the middle ten days.

    重庆开展“和先进水平一个样”运动
    全市实现的重大革新项目迅猛增加　七万八千多人赶上先进水平
    本报重庆18日电　重庆市广大职工全面开展“和先进水平一个样”的群众运动，已经把全民的技术革命运动和比、学、赶、帮的竞赛高潮，推向了新的阶段。
    一个样运动的全面开展，有力地推动了技术革命运动和比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛活动。“一个样运动”开展不到一个月，全市各行各业各厂矿、车间、小组职工，普遍提出了具体的努力目标，制订了赶先进的规划。这些目标和规划，包括生产水平、技术革新、企业管理、原材料节约、政治学习、领导方法等各个方面。这样就使比、学、赶、帮的竞赛不但规模更大，而且更加全面、深入和细致。以机械行业为例，开展“一个样”运动以来，这个行业的四十三个主要工厂，和这些工厂95％以上的小组、85％以上的个人，都全面订出了和全国、全市、全厂的先进水平一个样的指标、规划和措施。长安机器厂全面开展十个“一个样”运动后，在个人技术革新方面，工人们提出要和全国著名革新能手魏高厚一个样；在集体技术革新方面，各车间提出要和本厂第一个实现自动化、月月高产优质的工具科一个样；节约原材料方面，各部门提出要和本厂千方百计厉行节约的第一车间一个样；干部作风方面，全厂所有干部提出要和本厂一贯深入生产第一线、雷厉风行大搞群众运动的第六车间一个样等等。这样，就使全厂几乎100％的职工，都全面投入了一个样运动，出现一个空前高涨的学、比、赶、帮的热潮。
    由于各行各业职工把开展一个样运动的矛头首先指向技术革新和技术革命，使技术革新和技术革命运动发展得更加快、大、全、好、深、细，把运动推向了新的高峰。3月份，全市厂矿企业单位实现的半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化、联动化和重大的技术革新项目都迅猛上升。其中实现的半机械化项目达一万二千三百件，相当于3月份以前的60％，实现的机械化项目达九千五百五十五件，比2月底的累积数增加一倍多。由于“一个样”运动的深入开展，3月份以来先进的队伍不断扩大，有七万八千多名后进个人赶上先进水平。在工业战线上出现的全面跃进的先进厂矿企业单位越来越多。因此全市生产、生活、教育等各个方面都出现了全面跃进的局面。主要产品钢、煤的产量逐旬上升，3月中旬钢煤产量分别比上旬上升1.37％和8.4％，下旬又比中旬上升16％和30.9％。
