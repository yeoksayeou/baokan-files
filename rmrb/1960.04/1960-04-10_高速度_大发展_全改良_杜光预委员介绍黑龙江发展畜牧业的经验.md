Comrades Chairman and Members:
    I fully support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and will resolutely implement them in future work. I would now like to briefly introduce the development of animal husbandry production in Heilongjiang Province. Please correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

    Heilongjiang's Animal Husbandry Achieves Unprecedented Development
    Heilongjiang Province possesses superior conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry: beautiful and vast grasslands and pastures, relatively good breeds of livestock and poultry, and rich experience in animal husbandry accumulated by the working people. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the province has relatively fully utilized the above-mentioned superior conditions. Like agricultural production, animal husbandry has achieved continuous and comprehensive great leaps forward and bumper harvests in 1958 and 1959. In particular, the speed of animal husbandry production development in our province in 1959 was unprecedented in history. This is reflected in: (1) Large-scale production development. At the end of 1959, the number of livestock and poultry in the province increased by 65% compared with the same period in 1958; large livestock increased by 8.1%; sheep increased by 54%; poultry doubled; and fish, silkworms, bees, rabbits, and wild animals also increased significantly. (2) Large increase in female livestock. The number of large and small sows in 1959 increased by 60% compared with 1958. In Zhaozhou County, there were more small sows than large sows, and sows accounted for half of the total number of pigs, which laid the foundation for further development in the future. (3) A group of advanced units with large-scale bumper harvests have emerged. In Anda, Huma, Nehe, Tangyuan and other thirteen counties, pig production doubled or tripled. Baiquan County has achieved one pig per person, Anda County has reached five poultry per person, and Zhu Youying in Acheng County has created the experience of "one sow producing one hundred piglets per year". Anda County created the record of "one sheep producing five lambs per year". At the same time, many "ten-thousand-pig farms," "ten-thousand-chicken mountains," and "ten-thousand-duck bays" have also appeared. (4) The proportion of public raising has rapidly expanded. Now all cattle, horses, and sheep in the province are raised publicly. Pigs and poultry are raised publicly and privately, roughly half and half. The number of publicly raised animals has increased twelve times compared with before collectivization. Female livestock are basically controlled by the state and collectives. (5) While developing rapidly, a situation of total improvement has unfolded. An artificial insemination network has been formed. More than 180 breeding farms (at or above the county level) and more than 2,700 artificial insemination stations (points) have been established throughout the province. Most of the small horses in Keshan County are foreign horses. Most of the small calves in Anda County are improved breeds. Almost all the sheep in Boli County are improved breeds. (6) Science and technology in animal husbandry have also developed, and the scope of research has expanded. The harm of animal epidemics has been further eliminated and controlled. Counties have livestock disease prevention and control hospitals, communes have prevention and control stations, management areas have prevention and control rooms, and every team has an epidemic prevention worker. Animal disease prevention and control has formed a mass movement. (7) A new animal husbandry team has grown up. 160,000 young men and women throughout the province have joined the animal husbandry front, and many advanced producers who love animal husbandry have emerged, fundamentally reversing the masses' incorrect views on engaging in animal husbandry. In the past, someone wrote a poem saying: "Ten years of hard study, end up as a pig farmer, dirty and smelly, where's the future?" Some people also thought that young people engaged in animal husbandry was "a fresh flower stuck in a pile of manure." Now it's different. The atmosphere in society has also changed. For example, the Bin County Party Committee selected a large number of outstanding Party members and Youth League members to invest in the animal husbandry front. Some Party members and Youth League members who were not assigned to livestock farms complained to the branch and submitted applications several times. Bao Lianhua, a young Mongolian woman, Communist Party member, from the "San Hua" breeding station in the Duerbote Mongolian Autonomous County, bravely fought against old ideas, disregarded all obstacles from her backward family, and stepped forward to engage in breeding work, made achievements, and motivated the masses.

    These situations show that animal husbandry production in our province has entered a new stage of "great development, total improvement."

    Due to the development of animal husbandry, it has played a great role in the national economy, especially in the development of agriculture and light industry, and the improvement of people's lives. It has opened up a large number of fertilizer sources for crop cultivation, provided a large amount of raw materials for light industry, and supplied abundant meat, milk, fur, and wool for people's lives.

    In order to develop animal husbandry production more rapidly, Heilongjiang Province plans to conscientiously implement the general policy of "taking grain as the key link, making unified arrangements for grain, beans, oil, potatoes, vegetables, sugar, tobacco, hemp, fruits, silk, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, and promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries" in 1960, resolutely implement the policy of "taking pig raising as the center, achieving great development and total improvement in animal husbandry," and strive to achieve "five totals" (total mating, total accuracy, total birth, total survival, total strength) and "five -izations" (high yield-ization, improved breed-ization, disease-free-ization, base-ization, mechanization). We will resolutely continue to implement a whole set of two-pronged approaches: simultaneously undertaking self-sufficient production and commodity production; simultaneously undertaking state-owned animal husbandry bases and commune-run animal husbandry bases; and taking public raising as the main focus, simultaneously undertaking public raising and private raising. We will further implement the policy of the state and communes running bases, organs and enterprises engaging in self-sufficiency, and every household raising pigs and poultry. We demand that by the end of the year, every urban and rural resident will have one pig and five poultry. The people of the whole province have firm confidence and tenacious fighting spirit in realizing the above requirements. Now leaders at all levels and the vast number of animal husbandry personnel are actively striving to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the above plans.

    Experiences in Rapidly Developing Animal Husbandry
    Based on the development of animal husbandry production in our province in recent years, we have the following experiences:

    1.  Strengthening the Party's leadership and correctly implementing the various guidelines and policies of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee are the fundamental guarantees for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. In the development of animal husbandry, there is also a struggle between two ideologies and two methods. For example, on the issue of whether agriculture and animal husbandry can be carried out simultaneously, some people disagree with the simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry. They believe that "animal husbandry competes with grain for food" and "developing animal husbandry will inevitably squeeze out agriculture and affect grain production." People who hold this view do not understand the dialectical relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. They cannot see that the two depend on each other, promote each other, and are "ancestors and sons" to each other. Nor can they see that raising pigs can provide a large amount of manure for agriculture, provide raw materials for industry, accumulate funds for "four modernizations," and provide sources of goods for the market and export. This is essentially a reflection of the backward small-scale peasant economy's single-production ideology. They do not understand the principle that fields feed livestock, livestock feed fields, and both fields and livestock feed people. Experience over the past year has proved that large-scale animal husbandry production not only did not squeeze out agriculture and affect grain production, but on the contrary, it promoted agriculture and increased grain production.

    On the issue of whether the development of animal husbandry should put "pigs" first, or put "pigs" behind, there are also different views. Some people believe that putting "pigs" first is "putting the cart before the horse" and advocate putting "horses" first. We have insisted on the order of pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, fish, silkworms, bees, rabbits, and wild animals (of course, in grassland areas, large livestock should be the main focus). We have emphasized this when carrying out large-scale production and supply bases, and we have also emphasized this when carrying out self-sufficiency in the production of non-staple foods by organs and enterprises.

    On the issue of public raising and private raising, some people are actually opposed to "public raising as the main focus" and advocate "private raising as the main focus." They believe that pig and poultry production is "not suitable for collective management" and that "public raising as the main focus will affect development." Their reasons are that "large groups are not as good as small groups," "small groups are not as good as individual raising," "large collectives are not as good as small collectives," and "small collectives are not as good as dispersing to households." They say that "collectives have no experience in raising, and private raising is more attentive." Conversely, there are also some people who believe that "since we are doing public raising, why bother with private raising?" and advocate "sweeping away" private raising. They do not understand the mass nature of pig and poultry production. Large livestock should be completely publicly raised, but for pigs and poultry, we must "take public raising as the main focus, and combine public raising and private raising." Practice has proved that without "public raising as the main focus," there would be no "great development, total improvement." But if there is only public raising and no private raising, we cannot make better use of auxiliary labor and informal working hours.

    Can the development of animal husbandry production be at high speed? Is it large-scale development or small-scale development? Is it total improvement or partial improvement? There are also disputes. The vast majority of people advocate high speed, large-scale development, and total improvement, but some people believe that "the current base is poor and the conditions are not yet mature." "Large-scale development and total improvement, keeping all the sows without slaughtering any, is contradictory to expanding the commodity volume." They say that "if you want large-scale development and total improvement, you cannot expand the commodity volume. If you want to expand the commodity volume, you cannot have large-scale development. If you want large-scale development, you cannot have total improvement." They completely oppose the relationship between the three. More than two years of experience have proved that the more development, the larger the commodity volume. Keeping more sows, it seems that the fattening volume is less from the perspective of the sows, but the more sows there are, the more boars there are. Fattening with the more developed boars can make up for the commodity volume reduced by not slaughtering the sows. The fact that we kept more sows last year but the commodity volume did not decrease is proof.

    Different ideologies are also reflected in the issue of building livestock farms. Most places and units in the province have adopted the method of "starting from scratch" to build livestock and poultry farms. The investment is small, the development is fast, the achievements are great, and the effect is significant. This is a method that achieves more, faster, better, and more economically. Anda County adopted pigsties with "four no's" (no wood, nails, bricks, or tiles). The Wanggang People's Commune in Harbin dug cave-style pigsties on the hillside. The Yichun Court started a pig farm from scratch. Those who did this did it more, faster, better, and more economically. But some places reached out for money and materials, talked about extravagance, and pursued formalism. They advocated "doing it properly," requiring that the livestock pens be "brick and tile," with a construction cost of two hundred yuan per pig and one and a half kilograms of grain per day. If they didn't get it, they would wait, and the progress was very slow. In the past two years, the reason why animal husbandry production in Heilongjiang Province has achieved continuous and comprehensive great leaps forward and bumper harvests is that we have firmly implemented the Party's guidelines and policies in the struggle between two ideologies and two methods. It is the victory of the Party's strong and correct leadership.

    2.  Developing animal husbandry must involve a great technical revolution and a mass movement. Realizing the mechanization of animal husbandry production can greatly improve labor productivity and promote the sustained and high-speed development of socialist construction in rural areas. One prominent problem in the large-scale development of animal husbandry in our province is that there is a lot of land and few people and insufficient labor. In the past, on average, each person could only raise about 30 pigs and more than 500 chickens. According to this level, the large-scale development of animal husbandry in our province would require millions of laborers, and it is impossible to solve this large number of laborers in our province. Therefore, the only way is to mobilize the masses to carry out tool reforms on a large scale, to carry out mechanization on a large scale, and to try every possible means to improve labor productivity. At present, a mass movement to carry out mechanization and semi-mechanization of animal husbandry on a large scale has been formed throughout the province. Various places are carrying out mechanization in the areas of feed crushing, feed steaming, livestock water, and feed and manure transportation. The Northeast Agricultural College, the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin, and the breeding farm of the Provincial Meat Processing Factory have respectively developed "continuous operation automatic lines" for pig raising, which have increased efficiency by more than ten times. The Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Agricultural Mechanization has developed a chicken raising operation line, including feed processing, transportation, water supply and feed supply, egg picking, and manure removal, five continuous production processes, raising the level of 560 chickens per person to 10,000 chickens per person, increasing labor efficiency by 17 times. Although our province has a good start in animal husbandry mechanization, the degree of animal husbandry mechanization is not high, the projects are not complete, and we must continue to carry out mass movements in the spirit of indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. After evaluation and identification, we must standardize and match scattered single improved tools, develop towards serialization and comprehensive promotion, and thus push the mechanization of animal husbandry in our province to a new peak.

    3.  "Great Development, Total Improvement" is the correct policy for the great leap forward and bumper harvest of animal husbandry. The proposal of the policy of "Great Development, Total Improvement" of animal husbandry is based on the following: the advanced cooperative has entered the people's commune, the relations of production have changed, and the broad masses of the people demand the collective development of animal husbandry production. Many places have begun collective management; grain production has achieved continuous bumper harvests, laying a good foundation for the large amount of feed required for the great development of animal husbandry; new feed sources have been opened up, wild plants have been collected, and there are methods for silage and dry storage; artificial insemination has achieved relatively mature experience; methods for eliminating and controlling animal epidemics have been gradually explored and have begun to be mastered by the masses; the situation of "coarse wool sheep, long-legged pigs, short horses, and lumpy cattle" has begun to change. The above fully shows that our animal husbandry production has sufficient conditions to implement the policy of "Great Development, Total Improvement." The working experience over the past year has also strongly proved that this policy is completely correct. In the process of implementing the policy of "Great Development, Total Improvement," we have mainly focused on the following aspects:

      (1) Grasp the source of the seed. Implemented the principle of "self-breeding and self-raising as the main focus, supplemented by adjustment," each commune established its own breeding farm, implemented the method of "keeping all female livestock, not slaughtering any, only allowing slaughter of those who have lost their reproductive ability," and appropriately retained enough male livestock. All female livestock are fully retained, fully mated, and fully accurate, and all young livestock are fully born, fully alive, and fully strong, giving full play to the role of excellent breed male livestock. Implement dense mating, re-mating, multi-breeding, and multi-production, implement artificial insemination, and establish and improve the artificial insemination network. Counties have breeding farms and communes have breeding farms, achieving the breed-ization and pure-ization of male livestock. Strengthened the feeding and management of female livestock and breeding livestock to make them reproduce in large quantities. For example, widely promoted Zhu Youying's "one pig produces one hundred piglets" high-yield experience in Acheng County, realizing multi-breeding, large development, and total improvement.

    (2) Grab the feed. Implement the principle of silage as the main focus and refined feed as a supplement. Launch a mass movement on a large scale, vigorously collect various silage feeds, and ask the mountains, grasslands, and courtyards for feed. Adopt various methods such as silage, dry storage, and grinding to collect and store enough. Protect and cultivate grasslands, divide areas into sections, stipulate the scope of use and protection responsibilities, and implement a zoned rotational grazing system. Established feed bases, expanded reclamation, planted feed, and carried out comprehensive management. And pay attention to fully utilizing wheat and flax land to carry out feed re-cropping on a large scale, intercropping corn, soybeans, and other crops to expand feed sources. For refined feed, implement the use of livestock grain and the use of special grain for special purposes.

    (3) Grab the epidemic prevention work and achieve few diseases and no epidemics. Establish and improve municipal and county livestock epidemic prevention hospitals and mobile epidemic prevention teams, communes have livestock epidemic prevention stations, districts have epidemic prevention rooms, and teams have epidemic prevention personnel, expanding the livestock epidemic prevention team and making livestock epidemic prevention work mass-based. Implement isolation for sick livestock such as horse glanders and bovine tuberculosis. Pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry are universally and regularly vaccinated, reducing livestock diseases.

    (4) Strengthen feeding management work. The key to strengthening feeding management work is to strengthen the work of feeders. Now a group of feeders with one red (love for the socialist animal husbandry cause) and three passes (pass in feeding management, pass in disease prevention and control, pass in mating and knocking) have been trained, establishing a responsibility system, dedicated feeding, and enhancing the sense of responsibility; pigs, horses, cattle, and sheep have pens, chickens, ducks, and geese have nests, and pregnant livestock, productive livestock, and young livestock are fed in separate troughs and used separately. Protect the safety of female livestock and young livestock before and after production.

    (5) Establish livestock breeding bases. With breeding bases, a foundation is laid for large-scale development and total improvement. Since our province has vast grasslands and abundant feed resources, especially the western region has large grasslands, the grasslands are fertile, and lakes and marshes are dotted, and there is a large amount of land that can be planted with feed. These are extremely favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry. Therefore, state-owned livestock farms and people's commune livestock farms have greatly developed. State-owned animal husbandry production bases can batch and periodically fatten and ensure the completion of national plans in quantity and quality. People's communes running livestock farms on a large scale has become a common form and a basic force for developing animal husbandry production. In accordance with the policy of "self-reliance, self-breeding and self-raising, and self-sufficiency," urban organs, enterprises, schools, and troops have also greatly developed self-sufficiency in the production of non-staple foods over the past year. Most units have achieved partial self-sufficiency, and a few units have achieved basic self-sufficiency. All will achieve basic self-sufficiency in 1960.

    Comrades and Members, now a high tide of large-scale development and total improvement of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising has been set off in Heilongjiang Province. We firmly believe that under the wise and correct leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of the three red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, we will surely be able to further achieve a great victory in the great development and total improvement of animal husbandry production in our province!

    高速度  大发展  全改良
    杜光预委员介绍黑龙江发展畜牧业的经验主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席所作的报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现仅就黑龙江省的畜牧业生产发展情况作一简要发言，不当之处，请指正。
    黑龙江畜牧业获得空前发展
    黑龙江省具备着畜牧业高速度发展的优越条件：有优美广阔的草原牧场，有比较优良的畜禽品种，劳动人民积累有丰富的养畜经验。几年来，黑龙江省的畜牧业生产，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在中共黑龙江省委的直接领导下，较为充分地利用了上述的优越条件，同农业生产一样，获得了1958年、1959年连续的全面的大跃进大丰收。特别是1959年，我省畜牧业生产发展速度之快，是历史上前所未有的。表现在：（1）生产大发展。1959年末全省畜、禽等存栏数与1958年同期相比，生猪增长65％；大家畜增长8.1％；羊增长54％；禽翻了一番；鱼、蚕、蜂、兔、兽也都有很大的增长。（2）母畜大增加。1959年大小母猪比1958年增长60％，肇州小母猪比大母猪还多，母猪占猪的总数的一半，这就为今后进一步发展奠定了基础。（3）出现了一批大面积丰产的先进单位。安达、呼玛、讷河、汤原等十三个县生猪生产翻了一番到二番，拜泉县已经实现了一人一猪，安达县已达到一人五禽，阿城县祝有英创造了“一猪年产百仔”的经验，安达县创造“一羊年产五羔”的纪录，同时也出现了不少“万猪场”、“万鸡山”、“万鸭湾”。（4）公养比重迅速扩大。现在全省牛、马、羊全部公养了，猪禽公养、私养大体上各占一半，公养数比公社化以前提高十二倍，母畜基本上掌握在国家和集体手中。（5）在大发展的同时，展开了全改良的局面，人工授精网已经形成，全省已经建立了一百八十多处种畜场（县级以上），二千七百多处人工授精站（点）。克山县的小马大多数都为洋马，安达县的小牛犊大多数是改良种，勃利县绵羊几乎全部是改良羊。（6）在畜牧业方面科学技术也得到了发展，研究的范围也比较扩大，畜疫为害得到了进一步的清除和控制，县有家畜防治院，社有防治所，管理区有防治室，队队有防疫员，兽疫防治形成了群众性的工作。（7）一支新的畜牧业队伍已经成长起来。全省有十六万名男女青年参加了畜牧战线，出现了许许多多热爱畜牧事业的先进生产者，基本上扭转了群众对搞畜牧业不正确的看法。过去有人编了一首诗说：“十年寒窗苦，熬个养猪夫，埋汰脏又臭，上哪找前途”。也有人认为青年人搞畜牧业是“一朵鲜花插在粪堆上”。现在就不同了，社会上的气氛也变了，例如宾县县委挑选大批优秀的党团员投入畜牧战线，有些未被派到养畜场去工作的党团员便向支部提意见，几次提出申请。杜尔柏特蒙古族自治县“三花”配种站的蒙族青年妇女、共产党员包莲花，勇敢地向旧思想作斗争，不顾落后家庭的一切阻挠，挺身而出从事配种工作，作出了成绩，带动了群众。
    这些情况，说明了我省畜牧业生产已经进入了“大发展、全改良”的新阶段。
    由于畜牧业的发展，对于国民经济特别是对于农业、轻工业的发展和人民生活的改善，都起了很大的作用。为种植业开辟了大批的肥源，为轻工业提供了大量的原料，为人民生活供应了丰富的肉、奶、皮、毛。
    为了更迅速地发展畜牧业生产，黑龙江省计划1960年，在认真贯彻“以粮为纲，对粮、豆、油、薯、菜、糖、烟、麻、果、丝、药、杂十二个字统一安排，农林牧副渔全面大发展”的总方针下，坚决贯彻“以养猪为中心，畜牧业大发展、全改良”的方针，力争实现“五全”（全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮）、“五化”（高产化、良种化、无疫化、基地化、机械化）。坚决继续贯彻执行一整套两条腿走路的方针：实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举；国营畜牧基地和社办畜牧基地同时并举；以公养为主，公养和私养同时并举。进一步实行国家、公社办基地，机关、企业搞自给，家家户户养猪禽。要求年底实现城乡人口一人一猪，一人五禽。全省人民对实现上述要求，具有坚定的信心和顽强的斗志。现在各级领导和广大畜牧人员，正为保证完成和超额完成上述计划而积极努力。
    对于高速发展畜牧业的体会
    根据我省几年来畜牧业生产发展的情况，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、加强党的领导、正确贯彻中央和省委的各项方针政策是高速度发展畜牧业的根本保证。在畜牧业的发展上也有两种思想、两种方法的斗争，比如在农业和畜牧业能否同时并举的问题上，有的人不同意农、牧并举，他们认为：“畜牧业和粮食争嘴”“发展畜牧业必然挤掉农业，影响粮食生产”。持这种观点的人，不了解农业和畜牧业的辩证关系，看不到两者互相依存、互相促进、互为“祖宗和儿子”的关系，也看不到养猪能为农业提供大量粪肥，为工业提供原料，为“四化”积累资金，为市场和出口提供货源。这实质上是一种落后的小农经济单一生产的思想反映，不懂得田养畜，畜养田，田畜都养人的道理。经过一年来的经验证明，大搞畜牧业生产不但没有挤掉农业，影响粮食生产，恰恰相反，而是促进了农业，增产了粮食。
    发展畜牧业是以“猪”为首，还是把“猪”摆在后面的问题上，也有不同的看法。有人认为以“猪”为首是“本末倒置”主张以“马”为首。我们坚持了猪、马、牛、羊、禽、鱼、蚕、蜂、兔、兽的排法（当然在草原地区应以大牲畜为主），在大搞生产供应基地时这样强调了，在大搞机关、企业副食品生产自给中也这样强调了。
    在公养和私养问题上，有些人实际上是反对“公养为主”，主张“私养为主”的。他们认为猪禽生产“不宜集体”“公养为主就会影响发展”，他们的理由是“大群不如小群”“小群不如单养”“大集体不如小集体”“小集体不如分散到户”，他们说“集体养没有经验，不如私养上心”。相反的，也有一种人认为“既搞公养，何必私养”，主张把私养“一扫光”，他们不了解猪禽生产的群众性，大牲畜应当完全公养，对猪禽来说就必须以“公养为主、公养私养并举”。实践证明，没有“公养为主”，就没有“大发展、全改良”，但如果只有公养没有私养，也就不能更多地发挥辅助劳动力和非正式劳动时间的作用。
    畜牧业生产的发展能不能高速度？是大发展还是小发展？是全改良还是小部分的改良，也有争论。绝大多数人是主张高速度、大发展、全改良的，但是也有人认为“现在的基地差，条件不成熟”“大发展全改良，母猪全留一个不敲，与扩大商品量有矛盾”要“大发展全改良就不能够扩大商品量，要扩大商品量就不能大发展，要大发展就不能全改良”，他们把三者关系完全对立起来。两年多的经验证明，发展的越多，商品量才越大。母猪多留了，从母猪看似乎育肥量少了，但母多公也多，用多发展的公猪育肥是可以顶上因母猪不敲而减少的商品量的，去年我们母猪留的多，但商品量并未减少就是证明。
    在建畜牧场问题上也反映着不同的思想，全省大多数地方和单位采取了“穷打底”的办法建设畜禽场，投资少、发展快、成绩大、效果显著，这是多快好省的办法，安达县采取“四不用”（不用木材、钉子、砖、瓦）猪圈，哈尔滨市王岗人民公社利用山坡大挖窑洞式猪舍，伊春法院穷打底办起养猪场，这样干的都多快好省。但也有的地方伸手要钱、要物、讲阔气、追求形式，主张“搞就得像个样”，要求畜舍“砖瓦化”，有的一头猪要二百元的基建费，一天一斤半粮食，要不来就等着，结果进展很慢。两年来，黑龙江省的畜牧业生产所以取得了连续的全面的大跃进大丰收，是我们在两种思想、两种方法的斗争中坚决贯彻执行了党的方针政策的胜利，是党的坚强正确领导的胜利。
    二、发展畜牧业必须大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动。实现畜牧业生产的机械化，可以大大提高劳动生产率，促进农村社会主义建设事业持续地高速度向前发展。在畜牧业大发展当中我省一个突出的问题，是地多人少劳动力不足，过去平均每人只能养猪三十头左右，养鸡五百多只，按照这个水平计算，我们全省畜牧业的大发展，就需要劳力上百万人，而这些大批劳力，在我省来说实在没法解决。因此，唯一的办法就是发动群众大搞工具改革，大搞机械化，千方百计的提高劳动生产率。目前全省大搞养畜机械化、半机械化的群众运动已经形成，各地都在大搞饲料粉碎，饲料蒸煮，牲畜用水，饲料和粪便运送几方面的机械化。东北农学院、哈尔滨香坊人民公社和省肉类加工厂的饲养场已经分别搞出生猪饲养“连续作业自动线”，提高了效率十几倍；黑龙江省农业机械化学院制成了一条养鸡作业联结线，包括饲料加工、运输、供水供料、拣蛋和清除粪便五道连续生产过程，把过去每人养鸡五百六十只的水平提高到一万只的水平，提高劳动效率十七倍。我省在养畜机械化方面，虽然有了一个良好开端，但养畜机械化的程度还不高，项目还不全，还必须本着土法上马，土洋并举的方针，继续大搞群众运动，把分散的单项的改良工具经过评比鉴定，进行定型配套，向系列化全面推广的方面发展，从而把我省养畜机械化推向一个新的高峰。
    三、“大发展、全改良”是畜牧业大跃进、大丰收的正确方针。畜牧业“大发展、全改良”的方针的提出根据是：高级社进入了人民公社，生产关系改变了，广大群众要求畜牧业生产向集体发展，许多地方开始了集体经营；粮食生产获得了连年大丰收，为畜牧业大发展所需的大量饲料，奠定了良好基础；开辟了广阔的新饲料来源，搜集野生植物，青贮、干贮都有了办法；实行人工授精已取得了比较成熟的经验；消灭和控制畜牧疫病逐步摸索出了办法，并开始为群众所掌握；“粗毛羊、长腿猪、矮个马、疙疸牛”的情况开始得到改变。以上这些，充分说明我们畜牧业生产贯彻执行“大发展、全改良”的方针，是有足够条件的。一年来的工作经验，也有力的证明了这个方针的完全正确。在贯彻“大发展、全改良”的方针的过程中，我们主要的是抓住了以下几个方面：
      （一）抓种源。贯彻了“自繁自养为主，调剂为辅”的原则，社社建立了自己的繁殖场，实行“母畜全留，一个不敲，失掉繁殖能力的才准敲?”的办法，适当的留够公畜。母畜全留、全配、全准，仔畜全生、全活、全壮，充分发挥了优良种公畜的作用。密配、复配、多繁、多产，实行人工授精，建立与健全人工授精网，县有良种繁殖场，社有育种场，达到公畜良种化、纯种化。对母畜、种畜加强了饲养管理，使之大量繁殖，例如广泛推行阿城县祝有英“一猪百仔”高产经验，实现了多繁殖，大发展，全改良。
    （二）抓饲料。实行以青贮饲料为主，精饲料为辅的原则，大搞群众运动，大力搜集各种青贮饲料，向山野、向草原、向场院要饲料，采取各种青贮、干贮、磨碎等办法，收够贮足。保护和培育草原，划区分段，规定使用权限和保护责任，实行分区轮牧制度。建立了饲料基地，扩大开荒，种植饲料，进行综合经营。并注意充分利用小麦、亚麻地大搞饲料复种，套种苞米、大豆等作物，以扩大饲料来源。对于精饲料则实行畜粮畜用、专粮专用。
    （三）抓防疫工作，做到少病无疫。建立健全市、县家畜防疫院和巡回防疫队，社有家畜防疫所，区有防疫室，队有防疫员，扩大了畜疫防治队伍，使家畜防疫工作群众化。对于马鼻疽、牛结核的病畜实行隔离，猪、马、牛、羊、禽普遍定期打针，减少了牲畜的疫病。
    （四）加强饲养管理工作。加强饲养管理工作的关键是加强饲养员的工作，现在培养出一批一红（热爱社会主义的畜牧事业）、三通（通饲养管理、通防治疫病、通配种敲?）的饲养员，建立责任制度，专责饲养，增强责任感；猪马牛羊有圈，鸡鸭鹅有窝，妊畜、产畜、仔畜分槽饲养，分具使役。保护母畜、仔畜产前后的安全。
    （五）建立畜牧饲养基地。有了饲养基地就为大发展、全改良打下了基础。由于我省草原辽阔，饲料资源丰富，特别是西部地区有大片草原，草原肥美，湖泊沼泽，星罗棋布，并有大量土地可种饲料，这是发展畜牧业的极为有利的条件。因此，国营畜牧场和人民公社畜牧场有了很大的发展。国营畜牧业生产基地，能够分批分期育肥保证按量、按质完成国家计划。人民公社大办畜牧场，成为一种普遍的形式，成为发展畜牧业生产的基础力量。根据“自力更生、自繁自养、自给自足”的方针，一年来，城市机关、企业、学校、部队副食品生产自给也有了很大发展，大部分单位达到部分自给，少数单位已经达到基本自给。1960年将全部达到基本自给。
    各位委员，现在我们黑龙江省已经掀起一个以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产大发展、全改良的高潮，我们坚信：我省的畜牧业生产，在党的英明正确领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我们一定能够进一步取得大发展、全改良的伟大胜利！
