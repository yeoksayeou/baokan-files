Fellow representatives,

We have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960. We firmly support and guarantee to resolutely implement them in our work.

In 1959, on the basis of the comprehensive and extraordinary great leap forward in the national economy achieved in 1958, we continued to make great leaps forward, and we have also achieved a good start this year. These earth-shattering and unprecedented great achievements have greatly improved people's living standards and completely changed people's mental outlook. The Five-Year Plan was completed in two years, shocking the world, and China's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. This is the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune; it is the victory of launching mass movements; and ultimately, it is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The 1960 plan is a plan for continued leap forward and a plan that inspires people. Now the people of the whole country are launching a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution on all fronts of the national economy with soaring enthusiasm, high spirits, and fighting spirit. We industrialists and businessmen in Hunan must also, under the leadership of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees at all levels, and with the impetus of the working people, strengthen our remolding. Together with the people of the province, we will actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution.

Now, we would like to report to the conference on the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan. Please correct any inadequacies.

"Lean to one side, go all in, don't be like a weed on the wall"

Recently, the National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce convened national representative conferences. At this meeting, the Party put forward the call to our industrialists and businessmen to "lean to one side" and "go all in." The People's Daily published an editorial on March 1st. After the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan initially conveyed the spirit of the meetings through the representatives attending the meeting and initially studied the People's Daily editorial and relevant documents of the two national conferences, they were greatly encouraged. Everyone felt that the direction of continuing to accept socialist remolding in the future was clearer, and some people's emotions were stimulated in serving socialism, and a new atmosphere appeared. As the industrialists and businessmen in Changsha expressed in poems:

	"Lean to one side," "go all in,"
	Don't be like a weed on the wall,
	It will waver when the wind blows and the rain beats,
	It will be too late if both sides collapse.
	"Lean to one side," "go all in,"
	The Party's leadership is really good,
	The kindness is as vast as the sea, endless to tell,
	We will never leave and rely on it forever.
	"Lean to one side," "go all in,"
	Don't let the time slip away,
	Speed up remolding and strive forward,
	To the socialist sunny road.

At present, the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles in Changsha, Zhuzhou and other cities in our province to participate in technical innovation and technical revolution has increased significantly. The private personnel in various industries, with active service and strengthened remolding as the central content, have emerged with a competitive upsurge of challenge matches and response battles. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, some industrialists and businessmen, together with the workers, have made some new achievements. For example, after studying the People's Daily editorial, the private personnel in the waste products industry in Changsha created six innovation projects within a few days, including the electric lifting platform replacing the original heavy manual labor, which improved work efficiency by twenty times. In the Changsha Mass Machinery Factory, a private individual encountered many difficulties in modifying the follow-up tool rest for the production of rice transplanter shoots. However, he thought that this was a glorious task to support spring plowing and production, and it was a test of "leaning to one side" and "going all in" for himself. He worked hard day and night with the workers and finally succeeded, increasing work efficiency by five times, enabling apprentices to replace the operation of experienced masters and effectively supporting spring plowing and production. After hearing the report, the private personnel of the Zhuzhou Retail Trade Department returned to the enterprise and, under the leadership of the Party, established a technical innovation group and formulated a technical innovation plan. In early March, they created and promoted fifteen new tools, which played a positive role in reducing manpower and increasing production. It seems that with the in-depth implementation of the spirit of "leaning to one side" and "going all in" called for by the Party, the political enthusiasm of our industrial and commercial circles in Hunan is trending higher and higher; the trend of more and more people actively participating in mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation movements, and actively supporting spring plowing and production is also increasing. The industrial and commercial circles in various cities and counties have expressed that they will work hard for a month to make achievements and present gifts to the great "May Day" holiday.

The Fact That Dual Nature Still Exists Cannot Be Ignored

However, on the other hand, based on the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan, there are also some erroneous understandings of the spirit of "leaning to one side" and "going all in." For example, some are afraid that "leaning to one side" and "going all in" is not reliable, and that they will be "thrown away after crossing the river" in the future, or they are worried that they are old and weak, have many children, and will have difficulty living after the fixed interest is abolished in the future; some onesidedly understand "leaning to one side" and "going all in," that there are only national interests and people's interests, and that personal interests are lost, thus issuing the so-called "considering both sides is reasonable" argument; some believe that the problem of the industrial and commercial circles "leaning to one side" has long been solved, and what remains is only "considering one side." We believe that the essence of these thoughts fully shows that many people in the industrial and commercial circles in our province are still swaying and hesitant in the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, and have not yet made up their minds to abandon capitalism and completely lean to the side of socialism. Therefore, they always hold a skeptical attitude towards the Party, do not believe in the Party's policy of peaceful remolding, and cannot consciously grasp their own destiny.

We deeply realize that the Party's policy of peaceful remolding has always been consistent. For ten years, the Party has been extremely concerned about our industrialists and businessmen, both in terms of political treatment and economic interests. In the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan, some elderly and frail people have been well taken care of in their work and life. A few even take long-term leave to recuperate at home, and the enterprise still pays their wages. For those with too many children or who have real difficulties in life due to other accidents, the Party often provides them with living subsidies through the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Of course, exploitation must be completely eliminated, and as an industrialist and businessman who is willing to accept socialist remolding, it should also be welcomed, but as long as we have truly done beneficial things for the country and the people in the process of socialist remolding, then what reason do we have to doubt that the Party will not continue to take care of industrialists and businessmen who have real living difficulties after the fixed interest is abolished? We also deeply realize that our national industrialists and businessmen can only have a bright future and get our true personal interests by standing with the people and taking the socialist road. Recalling the years when we were under reactionary rule, the country was poor, and the people were unable to make a living. Although we were bustling and running around for personal interests, under the devastation of the three major enemies, our enterprises were generally in turmoil and precarious. Some were even bankrupted by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, resulting in broken families and nowhere to go. In that situation, what guarantee was there for personal interests? Looking at the present and looking forward to the future, our country's socialist construction has entered a new historical period, and all undertakings of the country will continue to leap forward. The lives of the working people have been greatly improved and will become more and more happy with the continuous development of production. As long as we industrialists and businessmen combine personal interests with national interests, subordinate personal interests to national interests, subordinate temporary interests to long-term interests, resolutely "lean to one side," "go all in," wholeheartedly strive for self-remolding and serve socialism, and unswervingly strive for the interests of the country and the people, we will surely gain the importance and trust of the people, and will also be taken care of by the people. Why worry about personal interests? It is inconceivable that an industrialist and businessman who cannot "lean to one side" can "go all in." Such a fact does not exist. Taking ourselves as an example, although we have made great progress under the Party's education for the past ten years, until today, we are far from being able to "lean to one side," and there are more times when "self is the most important." When the people's commune movement came the year before last, we were afraid of "three transformations," fearing that labor would be too much to bear and afraid that life would not be free. Last year, when the supply of certain non-staple foods on the market was temporarily tight in the first half of the year, we only cared about our own convenience and did not strictly follow the country's policies, and we also purchased certain daily necessities from outside the national market; on the issue of accepting the Party's leadership, we were not very active in reporting and requesting instructions. These facts show that we put personal interests above national interests and the interests of the people, so naturally it is impossible to "go all in" towards socialism. Therefore, we feel that most people in the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan, including ourselves, have made great progress in the past ten years, especially in the past two years, under the Party's education, but we must not ignore the fact that dual nature still exists, and we must not think that the problem of "leaning to one side" has long been solved and that there is no need to continue to strengthen the fundamental remolding of our political stand. As for our class prejudice, it is even more deeply rooted, and most people reflect that "self is the most important." With the continued deepening of the socialist revolution and the continuous leap forward of socialist construction, all remnants of capitalism will be completely eliminated not only in the economy, but also in politics, ideology, and all other fields. Therefore, while strengthening the remolding of our political stand, we must also carry out the remolding of our world outlook. Only in this way can we better promote or consolidate the remolding of our political stand. Inappropriately emphasizing personal interests and placing personal interests above national interests and the interests of the people is a reflection of our bourgeois world outlook. In the future, we must make the greatest determination to abandon the capitalist side, wholeheartedly consider the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and lean to the side of socialism.

Actively Participate in the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement

Based on the above situation, the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan feel encouraged by the Party's call to "lean to one side" and "go all in" and express their support; on the other hand, they are hesitant and wavering, and their thoughts and feelings are still afraid of capitalism being eliminated. This situation is worthy of our attention. Now we in Hunan are conveying and implementing the spirit of the National Congresses of the National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. We must do this work well under the leadership of the Party, explain the principles clearly to the industrial and commercial circles, so that the spirit of "leaning to one side" and "going all in" truly goes deep into the hearts of the people and becomes known to every household, and use this as a driving force to promote the active participation of the industrial and commercial circles in our province in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and actively support agricultural production. We will do our best and make every effort to make achievements in technical innovation, promotion of advanced experiences, creation and trial production of new products, reduction of manpower and increase of production, improvement of quality, reduction of costs, conservation and utilization of waste, training of apprentices, improvement of business management, improvement of service quality, improvement of service attitude, and comprehensive organization of people's economic life. At the same time, we must also actively participate in labor training, learn the noble qualities of the working people, cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and strengthen the remolding of our political stand and world outlook in production and labor practice. At the same time, we must also actively participate in the study of political theory; in particular, we must actively participate in the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works. We must constantly improve our consciousness, wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party, wholeheartedly accept remolding, and wholeheartedly serve socialism. If we persist in doing this unremittingly, we firmly believe that the industrial and commercial circles in Hunan will surely continue to make progress in the process of socialist remolding, and together with the people of the province, actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and together with the people of the province, strive to complete and overfulfill the grand plan for 1960!

    加紧改造奔前程　社会主义阳关道
    凌霞新代表、杨子霖委员谈湖南工商界的情况各位代表：
    我们听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，我们坚决拥护并保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    1959年，我国在取得1958年国民经济全面特大跃进的基础上，又继续取得了大跃进，今年又取得了年初的开门红。这种惊天动地，史无前例的伟大成就，大大地提高了人们生活水平，彻底地改变了人们精神面貌。五年计划，两年完成，震动了全世界，我国国际地位，空前提高，这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利；是大搞群众运动的胜利；归根到底，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    1960年的计划，是一个继续跃进的计划，是一个振奋人心的计划。现在全国人民正以冲天干劲，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在国民经济的各个战线上，掀起了一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的高潮。我们湖南工商业者，也一定要在中共湖南省委及各级党委的领导下，在劳动人民的带动下，加强改造。与全省人民一道，积极地投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。
    现在，我们就湖南工商界的情况，向大会作个汇报，不妥之处，请予指正。
    “顾一头，一边倒，莫像墙上一蔸草”
    最近，民建、工商联两会召开了全国代表大会，在这次会议上，党向我们工商业者提出了：“顾一头”、“一边倒”的号召。人民日报又于3月1日发表了社论。我们湖南工商界通过出席会议代表的初步传达和初步学习人民日报社论及两会全国代表大会有关文件后，受到了很大鼓舞。大家感到今后继续接受社会主义改造的方向更加明确了，在为社会主义服务方面，有些人感情上有所激发，出现了新的气象。正如长沙市工商业者用诗歌所表达的：
      “顾一头”、“一边倒”，
      莫像墙上一蔸草，
      风吹雨打就动摇，
      两头失塌就迟了。
     “顾一头”、“一边倒”，
      党的领导真正好，
      恩情似海说不完，
      生死不离永依靠。  
      “顾一头”、“一边倒”，
      莫把时间挨过了，
      加紧改造奔前程，
      社会主义阳关道。
    目前，我省长沙、株洲等市工商界参加技术革新和技术革命的劲头显著增大。各行各业的私方人员以积极服务、加强改造为中心内容，涌现出擂台比武、挑战应战的竞赛热潮。一部分工商业者，在党的领导和鼓励下，和职工一道，已做出一些新成绩。如长沙市废品业私方人员在学习人民日报社论后，几天之内，创造革新就有六个项目，其中电动升降机代替了原来笨重的体力劳动，提高了工效二十倍；长沙群众机械厂有个私方，在改装生产插秧机梢子的跟刀架时，遇到不少困难。但他想到这是支援春耕生产的光荣任务，是“顾一头”、“一边倒”，对自己的考验，和职工一道，日夜苦战，终于获得成功，提高工效五倍，使徒工能代替老师傅的操作，有效地支援了春耕生产。株洲市零售贸易处私方人员听了传达报告以后，回到企业，在党的领导下，成立了技术革新小组，制订了技术革新方案。3月上旬，创造推广十五项新工具，对减人增产起了积极作用。看来，随着党所号召的“顾一头”、“一边倒”精神的深入贯彻，我们湖南工商界的政治热情有越来越高的趋势；积极投入机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动，积极支援春耕生产的人也有越来越增多的趋势。各市县工商界纷纷表示要奋战一月作出成绩，向伟大的“五一”节献礼。
    不能忽视仍然存在两面性这一千真万确的事实
    但是，另一方面，我们根据湖南工商界的情况来看，对“顾一头”、“一边倒”的精神，也反映出若干错误的认识。如有的怕“顾一头”、“一边倒”靠不住，将来会“过河拆桥”，或者耽心年老体弱、子女多，到将来取消定息以后，生活上有困难不好办；有的片面的理解“顾一头”、“一边倒”，就只有国家利益和人民利益，失去了个人利益。因此发出所谓“两头都顾，合情合理”的论调；有的认为工商界“一边倒”的问题早就解决了，剩下的只是“顾一头”。我们认为这些思想的实质，充分说明我省工商界许多人，在资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争中，仍然摇摇摆摆，三心二意，还没有下决心放弃资本主义，彻底倒向社会主义这一边。因此，对党总是抱着怀疑态度，不相信党的和平改造政策，不能自觉地掌握自己的命运。
    我们深深地体会到党的和平改造政策是始终如一的。十年来，党对我们工商业者，无论是政治待遇和经济利益，都是关怀备至。在我们湖南工商界，有些年老体弱的人，在工作和生活上都得到妥善的照顾。有少数甚至长期请假在家休养，企业依然照发工资。对子女过多或因其他事故生活上确有困难的人，党经常通过工商联组织，给以生活上的补助。当然剥削必须彻底消灭，做为一个愿意接受社会主义改造的工商业者来说，也是应该欢迎的，但只要我们在社会主义改造过程中，真正为国家、为人民做了有益的事，那末又有什么理由怀疑在取消定息之后，党不给我们确有生活困难的工商业者继续照顾呢？我们还深切地体会到，我们民族工商业者，只有同人民站在一起，走社会主义道路，才有我们的光明前途，才能得到我们真正的个人利益。回忆我们在反动统治的年代里，国家贫弱，民不聊生，尽管我们熙熙攘攘，为个人利益奔走四方，但是在三大敌人的摧残下，我们的企业一般是风雨飘摇，朝不保夕。有的甚至被帝国主义和官僚资本主义搞破了产，弄得妻离子散，走投无路。在那种处境中，个人利益又有什么保障呢？看看现在，瞻望将来，我们国家的社会主义建设已经进入到一个新的历史时期，国家的一切事业，将继续向前跃进。劳动人民的生活已经大大地提高，也将随着生产不断的发展而越来越幸福。我们工商业者只要使个人利益和国家利益结合起来、使个人利益服从国家利益，暂时利益服从长远利益，决心“顾一头”，“一边倒”，一心一意努力自我改造和为社会主义服务，始终不渝地为国家利益和人民利益而努力，一定会得到人民的重视和信任，也会得到人民的照顾。何必为个人利益发愁呢？不能设想一个不能“顾一头”的工商业者，却能够做到“一边倒”，这样的事实是没有的。以我们自己为例，尽管经过党十年来的培养和教育，一直到今天，还远没有做到只“顾一头”，总是“我字当头”的时候较多。前年人民公社化运动来到的时候，我们就怕“三化”，畏惧劳动吃不消，害怕生活不自由。去年上半年市场上某些副食品一时供应较紧张，我们就只顾自己方便，不严循国家的政策，也曾从国家市场以外购买过某些生活用品；在接受党的领导问题上，汇报请示工作不太主动。这些事实，说明自己把个人利益放在国家利益和人民利益之上，自然也就不可能很好地“一边倒”向社会主义了。因此，我们感觉我们湖南工商业者的多数人，包括我们自己在内，十年来特别是最近两年来，虽然在党的教育下是大有进步了，但决不能忽视仍然存在两面性这一千真万确的事实，决不能认为“一边倒”的问题早就解决了，而不需要继续加强政治立场的根本改造。至于我们的阶级偏见更是根深蒂固的，多数人反映出“我字当头”。随着社会主义革命的继续深入，社会主义建设不断的跃进，资本主义的一切残余，不仅在经济上，而且在政治上、思想上以及其他一切领域中，将彻底地被消灭。所以在加强政治立场改造的同时，也要进行世界观的改造，只有这样，才能更好地推动或巩固我们政治立场的改造。不适当地强调个人利益，使个人利益驾凌于国家利益和人民利益之上，这正是我们资产阶级世界观的一种反映。今后必须下最大决心，丢掉资本主义那一头，一心一意顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。
    积极投入技术革新和技术革命运动
    根据上述情况，我们湖南工商界对党的“顾一头”、“一边倒”的号召，一方面感到鼓舞，表示拥护；另一方面又疑虑动摇，思想感情上仍然怕资本主义被消灭掉。这种情况，是值得我们注意的。现在我们湖南正在传达贯彻民建、工商联两会全国代表大会精神，我们一定要在党的领导下，把这一工作做好，向工商界讲清道理，使“顾一头”、“一边倒”的精神，真正做到深入人心，家喻户晓，并以此作为动力，推动我省工商界积极投入以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，积极支援农业生产。在技术革新、推广先进经验、创造试制新产品、减人增产、提高质量、降低成本、节约利废、培训学徒、改善经营管理、提高服务质量、改善服务态度及全面组织人民经济生活等方面，尽心竭力，千方百计，作出成绩。同时也要积极参加劳动锻炼，学习劳动人民的高贵品质，培养劳动人民的思想感情，在生产、劳动实践中加强政治立场和世界观的改造。与此同时还必须积极参加政治理论学习；特别是要积极投入学习毛主席著作的热潮。不断提高自觉，一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟共产党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务。这样坚持不懈地做下去，我们深信我们湖南工商业者，一定可以在社会主义改造过程中不断获得进步，与全省人民一道，积极地投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，与全省人民一道，为完成和超额完成1960年的宏伟计划而奋斗！
