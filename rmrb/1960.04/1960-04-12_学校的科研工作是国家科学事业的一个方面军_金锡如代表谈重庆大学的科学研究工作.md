Comrades Delegates:

I fully agree with and support the reports made to the conference by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I guarantee to implement them in the future.

I would now like to give a brief report to the conference on the scientific research situation at Chongqing University over the past six months, and I welcome your criticisms and corrections.

On the basis of the victory in the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, our university has further implemented the Party's educational policy, making the education revolution more thorough and promoting a continued great leap forward in all aspects of the university's work. Since the "good start" this year, propelled by the vigorously developing "Four Modernizations" movement, scientific research has been developed to a greater extent, entering a new stage. This year, our university has a total of 1,217 scientific research projects, of which more than 50% belong to cutting-edge technologies and major issues of the national economy. Among the 317 major projects completed or in the stage of completion in the past six months, 122 belong to cutting-edge technologies and major issues of the national economy.

The characteristics of our university's scientific research work this year are that the scope is wider than in the past, the degree is deeper than in the past, there are more cutting-edge technologies than in the past, and the quality is higher than in the past. For example, the research on automation of mechanical production in cooperation with factories and mines only involved the design and manufacture of one "automatic ball-bearing processing line" in 1958. Although it was put into production, the product quality was not high. In 1959, research was conducted on three automatic lines, and the complex technical problem of photoelectric inspection was further solved. In 1960, research was conducted on eighty-eight automatic production lines and recently participated in the central "Four Modernizations" on-site conference held in Chongqing. This specifically illustrates the scientific research work of our university. Under the leadership of the Party, it is developing rapidly from point to line, from line to surface, from few to many, from low to high.

Judging from our university's scientific research projects this year, the main projects are tasks assigned by the state, province, and city. These include cutting-edge science and technology, major issues of the national economy, trial production of advanced industrial products, and new technology issues. The assignment of these tasks not only greatly encourages and challenges teachers and students, but also strongly promotes the development of scientific research in the university. Scientific research work at the university has become an aspect of the national science and technology endeavor.

From the perspective of factory-university collaboration, there has been further development compared to the past. For many major projects, under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, factory, university, and research institutions jointly organize research forces. This aligns the technical forces of factories, universities, and research institutions into one rope, one effort, bringing into play the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, and accelerating the completion of the scientific research tasks assigned to us by the state. This year, more than seven hundred graduates and a large number of fourth-year students are combining their graduation designs and course designs with scientific research projects. At present, 239 units in Chongqing have established cooperative relationships with our university, and 136 units have signed collaboration contracts. For example, twenty-seven units are collaborating in the research on computer technology. We believe that this kind of collaboration should be expanded, because it is conducive to the development of comprehensive scientific research, conducive to the development of scientific undertakings, conducive to climbing the peaks of science, and more conducive to accelerating socialist construction.

From the perspective of the number of people participating in scientific research, not only the majority of teachers and senior students participate, but also junior students and staff have joined the ranks of scientific research. This is a mass movement of scientific research, a sign of a more widespread and in-depth development. Climbing the peaks of science and marching towards high, large, sophisticated, and scarce goals has become the conscious demand and action of the broad masses.

In the process of scientific research, holding various report meetings and discussion meetings has become an important form of implementing the Party's policies, mobilizing the masses, and solving key problems in scientific research work. In the research of our university's "New Technology Power Station," more than 140 report meetings and discussion meetings were held in just two and a half months, and a total of 34 major key problems were solved. This not only solved major technical problems in production, but also enriched teaching content and improved teaching quality. Students have received comprehensive training through productive labor and scientific research, and their ability to work independently has been greatly improved. This is a great victory for the Party's educational policy, a great victory for the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the situation of high-speed development of socialist construction, the tasks facing us are extremely glorious and arduous. How can we complete the task well?

I. We must adhere to the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, adhere to the mass line, and carry out mass movements on a large scale. – Our university's scientific research work has achieved remarkable results in a short period of time, mainly because under the leadership of the Party, we have carried out mass movements on a large scale and constantly carried out the struggle between the two roads, the two ideologies, and the two methods. In the field of science and technology, the influence of bourgeois ideology still exists seriously, and the struggle between the two roads in politics and ideology still rises and falls from time to time. Some people are outwardly obedient to the Party's leadership of science but inwardly unconvinced, and some people still do not believe in the masses, especially junior students. But the facts are exactly the opposite. Scientific research projects such as the "Automatic Ball-Bearing Processing Line" and the "Electronic Computer" were collectively researched, designed, and manufactured by young teachers and students with an average age of less than twenty-three years old. The research on gas diesel engines conducted by first-year students in the internal combustion engine major under the guidance of teachers, the modified diesel engine uses gas instead of diesel, which can save 80% of oil consumption and increase productivity by 25%. All this shows that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Once fully mobilized, it can break superstitions, liberate the mind, break through old constraints, and there are no insurmountable difficulties and no unsolvable problems. In the research of our university's "New Technology Power Station," many electronic devices are needed as automatic adjustment devices, but they cannot be bought. Later, after research by the masses, the hydraulic adjustment was proposed, which not only saved the state 300,000 yuan in investment, but also solved the difficulty of lacking electronic equipment. In scientific research, it is necessary to carry out mass movements on a large scale. At present, it seems that most people accept it, but the understanding of how to estimate the role of mass movements in the development of science and technology is still insufficient. Some people think that the masses can only engage in general technology and use the masses as labor force, but do not mobilize the masses from the organizational and ideological aspects. As a result, there are only masses, but no movement, and the work is bound to be cold and slow. The scientific report meeting held by our university at the end of March is still a mass movement on a large scale. We have adopted various forms such as challenge matches, on-site meetings, discussion meetings, report meetings, and exhibitions to conduct evaluation and appraisal to promote the development of scientific research, and used the forms of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to check work, check results, and summarize experiences. This report meeting posted 21,445 big-character posters throughout the university, and each department and grade held 1,521 group report meetings and discussion meetings, wrote 177 papers, 1,041 scientific and technological materials, and 5,114 experience summaries, setting off a new upsurge in the scientific movement on a large scale in the university and rapidly improving the level of science and technology.

II. We must further break superstitions, liberate the mind, and adhere to the policy of walking on two legs. The scientific research work facing us has certain difficulties. Therefore, we must further break superstitions and liberate the mind. We must have great ambitions, dare to think and dare to act; make up our minds and persevere to the end; we must use book knowledge and absorb the experience of others; but we must not be bound by books or limited by the experience of others. We must give full play to revolutionary vigor, work hard and skillfully, learn while doing, and constantly improve. In the process of research, we must implement the policy of "if possible, use foreign methods; if possible, use indigenous methods; indigenous methods give birth to foreign methods; combine foreign and indigenous methods" of walking on two legs. Our university's 1,500 kW thermal power plant was built in the shortest period of time under the leadership of the Party, by combining teachers and students, and resolutely implementing this policy.

III. We must vigorously cultivate new forces who are both red and expert. Young teachers in our university account for 92% of the total number of teachers in the university, and about 95% of the lecturing teachers. They account for more than 80% of the leading backbone in teaching and scientific research. While giving full play to the active role of older teachers, we must fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of young teachers in order to complete scientific research tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. Vigorously cultivating new forces through practice is the key issue for improving the quality of education and completing scientific research tasks at present. We deeply realize that cadres cultivated through practice have both theory and practice; the quantity is large, the quality is high, and the speed is fast. This not only strengthens the scientific research team, but also creates conditions for opening new majors. We added ten new majors this year on the basis of past scientific research.

IV. We must conscientiously implement the principle of combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. While doing a good job in teaching, universities must conduct scientific research and small-scale production. Comprehensively cultivating students through teaching, productive labor, and scientific research is a method of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, and is a concrete measure to implement the Party's educational policy. Therefore, while adding new majors, we have also established laboratories for related majors, developing and improving the base for combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. We have created material conditions for engaging in in-depth scientific research work. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, "In the field of scientific research, actively increase researchers, increase research institutions, and increase necessary equipment and instruments. We must further closely integrate scientific research, education, and production." Experience tells us that if we deal with "three combinations" erratically, we will inevitably grasp this and lose that. Therefore, scientific research work must be unifiedly planned and comprehensively arranged under the leadership of the Party, and resolutely implement the principle of "three combinations."

Although our university's scientific research work has achieved some results, it is still far from what the objective situation requires. We still need to:

I. With the greatest determination and the fastest speed, overcome all difficulties and engage in research on cutting-edge science and technology.

II. Grasp the major key issues of the national economy, conduct research, and resolutely implement the policy of scientific research serving production and serving national defense.

III. Summarize the rich experience of mass practice, and further carry out research on basic theory and teaching theory.

In short, the scientific research tasks facing us are arduous and glorious. We must resolutely listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, give full play to greater revolutionary vigor, conscientiously study Chairman Mao's great works, use Chairman Mao's thought to arm our minds, and strive to learn, study, and master the world's latest scientific and technological achievements, summarize the rich experience of mass practice, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to realize the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period of time.

    学校的科研工作是国家科学事业的一个方面军
    金锡如代表谈重庆大学的科学研究工作各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春、李先念副总理向大会所作的报告，并保证今后贯彻执行。
    现将重庆大学近半年来的科学研究情况，向大会作一简要汇报，请代表们批评指正。
    我校在反右倾斗争胜利的基础上，进一步贯彻了党的教育方针，使教育革命更加深入，学校各方面的工作，都得到了继续的大跃进。今年开门红以来，在蓬勃发展的“四化”运动的推动下，科学研究工作得到了更大的发展，进入了新的阶段。我校今年的科学研究项目共有一千二百一十七项，其中属于尖端技术和国民经济重大问题的占50％以上。就半年来完成或阶段完成的主要项目的三百一十七项中，属于尖端技术和国民经济重大问题的有一百二十二项。
    我校今年科学研究工作的特点，是范围比过去广，程度比过去深，尖端技术比过去多，质量比过去高。例如与厂矿协作搞机械生产自动化的研究，在1958年只设计和制造了一条“滚珠加工自动线”，虽投入了生产，但产品质量不高。在1959年进行了三条自动线的研究，并进一步解决了光电检验这一复杂技术问题。在1960年，就进行了八十八条生产自动线的研究并在最近参加了中央在重庆召开的“四化”现场会。这具体说明了我校的科学研究工作。在党的领导下，是由点到线，由线到面，由少到多，由低到高，迅速向前发展的。
    从今年我校科学研究项目来看，主要项目是国家、省、市下达的任务。其中有尖端科学技术，国民经济重大问题，工业上尖精产品试制，新技术问题等。这些任务的下达，不仅给师生以很大的鼓舞和要求，更有力地推动了学校科学研究的发展。学校的科学研究工作已成为国家科学技术事业的一个方面军。
    从厂、校协作的形式来看，比过去有进一步的发展。许多重大项目，在重庆市科委的领导下，由厂、校、研究机关共同组织研究力量。这样使厂、校、研究机关的技术力量，拧成一根绳，一股劲，发挥共产主义大协作的精神，加速完成国家交给我们的科学研究任务。今年七百多毕业生和一大部分四年级学生都结合科学研究项目，进行毕业设计和课程设计。目前在重庆已有二百三十九个单位与我校建立合作关系，有一百三十六个单位订立了协作合同。例如进行的计算技术方面的研究，就有二十七个单位进行协作。我们认为这种协作应予扩大，因为有利于综合性科学研究的发展，有利于科学事业的发展，有利于攀登科学高峰，更有利于加速社会主义的建设。
    从参加科学研究人数来看，不仅广大教师和高年级学生参加，就是低年级学生和职工也跨进了科学研究的行列。这是科学研究工作的群众运动，更加广泛深入的一种标志，攀登科学高峰，向高大精缺进军，已成为广大群众自觉的要求和行动。
    在科学研究过程中，召开各种报告会、讨论会已成为科学研究工作中贯彻党的方针，发动群众，解决关键的一种重要形式。我校“新技术电站”的研究，在短短的二个半月就召开了一百四十多次报告会和讨论会，前后共解决了三十四项重大关键问题。这样不但解决了生产上的重大技术问题，也充实了教学内容，提高了教学质量。学生们通过生产劳动和科学研究受到了全面的培养，独立工作的能力，大大地提高。这是党的教育方针的伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    在社会主义建设高速度发展的形势下，摆在我们面前的任务，是极其光荣，而艰巨的。我们如何来很好完成任务呢？
    一、必须坚持党的领导，政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。——我校的科学研究工作，在短期间取得了显著成绩，主要由于在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，不断地开展两条道路、两种思想、两种方法的斗争。在科学技术领域中，资产阶级思想的影响，还是严重存在着，政治上、思想上两条道路的斗争，还是时起时伏。有的人对党领导科学尚口服心不服，有的人对群众还不相信。特别是对低年级学生更不相信。但是事实恰巧相反，像“滚珠加工自动线”“电子计算机”等科学研究项目，就是平均年龄不到二十三岁的年青师生集体研究设计制造出来的。内燃机专业一年级学生在教师指导下进行的煤气柴油机的研究，改装后的柴油机以煤气代柴油，可节省用油80％，提高生产率25％。这一切说明群众的智慧，是无穷的。一经充分发动，就能破除迷信，解放思想，冲破旧的束缚，就没有不可克服的困难，没有不可解决的问题。在我校“新技术电站”的研究中，需要很多的电子设备作自动调节装置，但买不到。后经群众研究提出液压调节，不但为国家节省了三十万元投资，也解决了缺乏电子设备的困难。在科学研究工作上必须大搞群众运动，目前看来多数人是接受的，但是如何估计群众运动在发展科学技术上的作用，那还认识不够。有人认为群众只能搞一般的技术，把群众当劳动力使用，而不从组织上思想上发动群众，其结果只有群众，而没有运动，工作必然是冷冷清清，进展不快的。我校在3月底召开的科学报告会仍然是大搞群众运动的。我们采取了打擂比武现场会、讨论会、报告会、展览会等各种各样形式，进行评比、鉴定，来推动科学研究的发展，运用大鸣大放、大争大辩和大字报等形式，检查工作，检查成果，总结经验。这次报告会全校贴出大字报二万一千四百四十五张，各系各年级举行分组报告会、讨论会一千五百二十一次，写出论文一百七十七篇，科学技术资料一千零四十一篇，经验总结五千一百一十四篇，在校内掀起大搞科学运动的新高潮，迅速地提高了科学技术水平。
    二、必须进一步破除迷信，解放思想，坚持两条腿走路的方针。摆在我们面前的科学研究工作，是存在着一定困难的。因此必须进一步破除迷信，解放思想。要立大志，敢想敢干；下决心，坚持到底；要运用书本知识，要吸取他人经验；但不要受书本的束缚，不要受旁人经验的限制，鼓足革命干劲，苦干加巧干，边干边学，不断提高。在研究的过程中，必须贯彻“能洋则洋，能土则土，土中生洋，洋土结合”的两条腿走路的方针。我校一千五百瓩的火力发电站，就是在党的领导下，师生结合，坚决贯彻这一方针用最短的时期建立起来的。
    三、必须大力培养又红又专的新生力量。我校青年教师占全校教师总数的92％，占讲课教师中的95％左右。教学、科学研究领导骨干中占80％以上。在发挥老年教师的积极作用的同时，必须充分调动青年教师的积极性和创造性，才能更多、更快、更好、更省的完成科学研究任务。通过实践大力培养新生力量，是当前提高教育质量，完成科学研究任务的关键问题。我们深深认识到通过实践培养出来的干部，既有理论，又有实际；数量多，质量高，速度快。这不仅壮大了科学研究队伍，同时为开办新专业创造了条件。我们今年开学时就在过去科学研究的基础上，增加了十个新专业。
    四、必须认真贯彻教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合的原则。高等学校的工作，在搞好教学工作的同时，必须进行科学研究和小规模的生产。使学生通过教学、劳动生产、科学研究等方面进行全面培养，是多快好省的方法，是贯彻党的教育方针的具体措施。因此，我们在增设新专业的同时，又建立了有关专业的实验室，发展和提高了教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合的基地。为从事深入开展科学研究工作创造了物质条件。正如李富春副总理在报告中所指示的“在科学研究事业方面，积极增加研究人员，增设研究机构，增加必要的设备和仪器。要进一步密切科学研究、教育、生产三者之间的结合”。经验告诉我们，若在处理“三结合”上，忽左忽右，势必抓到这个，丢掉那个。因此科学研究工作必须在党的领导下，统一规划，全面安排，坚决贯彻“三结合”的原则。
    我校科学研究工作，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是距客观形势所要求，那还差的很远。我们还要：
    一、以最大的决心，最快的速度，克服一切困难，从事尖端科学技术的研究。
    二、抓紧国民经济的重大关键问题，进行研究，坚决贯彻科学研究为生产服务为国防服务的方针。
    三、总结群众实践的丰富经验，进一步开展基础理论及教学理论方面的研究。
    总之，摆在我们面前的科学研究任务，是艰巨而光荣的。我们一定要坚决地听党的话，听毛主席的话，鼓足更大革命干劲，认真钻研毛主席的伟大著作，用毛主席的思想，武装我们的头脑，并努力学习、研究和掌握世界上最新的科学技术成就，总结群众实践的丰富经验，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，为争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学技术规划而奋勇前进。
