Comrades and Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

In 1959, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our Dama People's Commune in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, achieved continuous increases in production and bumper harvests season after season, building upon the great leap forward of 1958. The total grain output of the commune reached 44,720,000 jin, an increase of 31.2% compared to 1958, with an average yield of 1,250 jin per mu. The fact of continuous bumper harvests has made us deeply realize that to achieve high yields and bumper harvests in agricultural production, vigorously promoting technological innovation and inventions is a major key. During the great leap forward of 1958 and 1959, we firmly grasped this key, successively innovating and creating advanced agricultural tools such as water pumps driven by waterwheels, single-person pedal waterwheels, six-row strip seeders, five-row planters, grass cutters, rice transplanters, and a large number of new-style tools for water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation and production. We also created the steam-induced germination and steam-seedling cultivation methods for rice, and cultivated the "ten thousand grain jin" good rice variety.

This year, we have also manufactured "native boats" and created the dryland warm bed seedling cultivation method for rice and the three-mud water seed selection method. These innovations and creations have greatly improved labor productivity and promoted an all-round great leap forward in agricultural production.

Changing single-season rice to double-cropping rice is an important measure to increase the yield per unit area of rice. To plant double-cropping rice, the sowing period must be advanced, but advancing the sowing period easily leads to rotten seedlings due to the cold climate; at the same time, labor is very tight after the large-scale conversion. What to do? The Party branch mobilized everyone to use their brains to find solutions, and as a result, based on the principle of making maltose, the steam germination method was created. Rice seeds that have undergone steam germination not only do not rot when sown in the fields, but also can be transplanted in just six to ten days, shortening the seedling period by ten days to half a month compared to normal. Later, steam germination was further developed into a steam rapid seedling cultivation method. In the past, one mu of seedling field required 56 workdays, equivalent to 11 workdays per mu of main field. After adopting the steam seedling cultivation method, only four workdays are required. All 4,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the commune adopted steam seedling cultivation, saving a total of about 28,000 workdays. This not only advanced the rice transplanting season, but also freed up a batch of labor to be invested in other production, solving the contradiction of seasonal labor shortage, and also created favorable conditions for bumper early rice harvests and surpassing early rice in late rice.

The fertilizer in our commune was mostly transported from Hangzhou and other places, a round trip of one to two hundred li, with two people only transporting one boatload of fertilizer in three days. After we mobilized the masses and after many experiments, we used water pumps as power to create "native boats." These native boats tow 15 to 20 wooden boats, transporting more than 45 tons of fertilizer at a time, saving 40 laborers each time. In addition, they can also carry industrial raw materials and other agricultural products, truly achieving multiple benefits. In this spring's fertilizer accumulation campaign, we also used oxen to pull river mud rakes and waterwheels to cart river mud, increasing work efficiency by ten to fifteen times respectively.

In the past, we used to select seeds by hand, and each person could only select about three jin per day, which would delay the production season. Based on several years of seed selection experience, everyone summarized a set of three-mud water seed selection method. Because miscellaneous grains and shriveled grains are lighter than good grains, and the buoyancy of mud water is greater, after three times of immersion selection in mud slurry, the inferior seeds float up, and the good seeds sink to the bottom. With this seed selection method, the purity can be as high as 99% or more, and it can also play a role in sterilization and disinfection, increasing work efficiency by 25 to 30 times compared to manual selection.

Through a series of innovation facts, everyone developed a strong interest in improving tools and innovating technologies, liberated their minds, and strengthened their confidence and determination to conquer nature. Many commune members signed up to join the innovation research group, so that the original youth innovation group quickly developed into a mass innovation organization in which men, women, old, and young all participated. The three-mud water seed selection method was first thought of by an ordinary commune member.

The main reason for achieving the above results is due to the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, nothing can be created. Last year, when we adopted steam seedling cultivation, we planted a trial field as early as "Jingzhe" (March 6th). The commune organized hundreds of people to visit, but the next day, it encountered a severe frost, which scorched the seedling heads. At that time, some people did not believe that these seedlings could survive, and some wealthy peasants took the opportunity to spread fallacies among the masses, such as "The frost-free period in the Hangjiahu area is short, and it is not suitable to grow double-cropping rice. Steam seedling cultivation cannot achieve high yields," attempting to negate steam seedling cultivation. At this critical moment, the commune Party committee directly led us to save the seedlings. The Party committee secretary went deep into the fields and studied measures with the commune members, and found that irrigation could protect the seedlings. They pumped water every day, and after five days, the seedlings turned green and grew more vigorously than ordinary rice. At this time, the commune Party committee pointed out to us that this was the first step in overcoming difficulties, and that we should cultivate and manage it more carefully in the future. At the same time, it immediately convened an on-site meeting to comprehensively promote the steam rapid seedling cultivation method, dispelling the superstition among the majority of cadres and masses that transplanting could not be done during "Jingzhe." During the summer harvest, the average yield of early rice per mu reached 800 jin, of which 13 mu averaged 1,132 jin per mu. Without the correct leadership of the Party, how could we have achieved a bumper harvest. Secondly, practice has taught us that to engage in technological innovation, everyone must participate and mobilize everyone to engage in it. For example, when we were trial-manufacturing "native boats," many young people actively invested in this work. When there was no copper for making propellers, the masses took the initiative to take out the old copper from their homes. When they had raw materials but did not know how to process them, the director of the machine repair factory personally helped us process them. When the small boat's machine could not be installed, the commune specially invited technicians to help us study and install it together. After eight trials and four months of effort, the native boat was successfully trial-manufactured.

Comrades and Representatives, in this era of continuous great leap forward, the situation is compelling. Although we have achieved some results, we are still far from the requirements of the Party. In 1960, in order to achieve three major bumper harvests in grain, animal husbandry, and silkworm cocoon production, all-round development of various industries, and a basic change in appearance, we are currently testing native tractors, and also preparing to use the water power of mechanical drainage and irrigation in canals and the heat of brick kilns to generate electricity. Our slogans are: "What to do, what to study, what to innovate," "If we can use foreign methods, we will use them; if we cannot, we will start with native methods." This year, we must realize the wish of "no need for oxen to plow fields, no need to carry loads on shoulders, and electrification of silkworm rooms for lighting and heating." We believe that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relying on the People's Communes, learning from advanced units with an open mind, and constantly innovating and creating, we will definitely be able to achieve this year's various production targets.

    大搞技术革新，做自然界的主人
    陆巧生代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。
    1959年，我们浙江桐乡县大麻人民公社，在总路线的光辉照耀下，农业生产在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得熟熟增产、季季丰收。全社粮食总产量达四千四百七十二万斤，比1958年增长31.2％，平均亩产量达一千二百五十斤。连年大丰收的事实，使我们深深体会到，要使农业生产高产丰收，大搞技术革新，大搞发明创造是一个主要关键。在1958、1959两年的大跃进中，我们紧紧抓住这个关键，先后革新和创造了抽水机带动水车、单人脚踏水车、六行条播机、五行点播机、切草机、插秧机等先进农具，和兴修水利、积肥造肥方面的大批新式工具，创造了水稻蒸汽催芽和蒸汽育秧法，培育出水稻“万粒斤”良种。
    今年，我们又制成了“土轮船”和创造了水稻旱地温床育苗法、三道泥水选种法。这些革新和创造，大大地提高了劳动生产率，促进了农业生产全面大跃进。
    单季稻改为连作稻，这是提高水稻单位面积产量的一项重要措施。种连作稻，播种期必须提早，可是提早播种期，因气候寒冷，容易烂秧；同时大面积改制以后，劳动力十分紧张。怎么办呢？党支部发动大家动脑筋想办法，结果根据做麦芽糖的道理，创造了蒸汽催芽法。经过蒸汽催芽的稻种播到田里，不仅不发生烂秧，而且只要六天到十天就可以插秧，育秧期比一般缩短十天到半个月。后来又进一步把蒸汽催芽发展成蒸汽快速育秧法。过去搞一亩秧田需要五十六个工，折合每亩本田需要十一个工，采用蒸汽育秧法后，只要四个工。全社四千亩双季稻，全部采用了蒸汽育秧，共节约劳动力二万八千个工左右。不但提早了插秧季节，而且还抽出一批劳动力投入其他生产，解决了季节性劳力不足的矛盾，也为早稻大丰收、晚稻超早稻创造了良好的条件。
    我们公社里的肥料，大部分到杭州等地去运的，来回一、二百里路，两个人三天只运一船肥。经过我们发动群众，并经过多次试验，利用抽水机作动力造成了“土轮船”。这种土轮船，拖十五只到二十只木船，一次运肥四十五吨以上，每次节省四十个劳力。另外，还可以捎运工业原料和其他农产品，真是一举数得。在今春积肥运动中，我们又利用牛拉河泥耙和水车车河泥，工效分别提高十倍到十五倍。
    过去我们都是用手工选种的，每人每天只能选三斤左右，这样的速度会延误生产季节。大家根据几年来的选种经验，总结了一套三道泥水选种法。因为杂谷、秕谷比好谷来得轻，泥水的浮力来得大，经过三次泥浆水的浸选，差的谷种就浮起来了，好的谷种多沉在下面。这样选种，纯度可以高到99％以上，还能起到灭菌消毒的作用，工效比手选提高二十五到三十倍。
    通过一系列的革新事实，大家对改进工具、革新技术发生了浓厚的兴趣，解放了思想，增强了战胜自然的信心和决心。许多社员纷纷报名参加革新研究小组，使原来的青年革新小组很快发展成为男女老幼都参加的群众性革新组织。三道泥水选种法，就是一个普通社员首先想出来的。
    取得上述成绩的主要原因是由于党的领导，没有党的领导，什么都创造不出来。去年，我们采用蒸汽育秧，早在“惊蛰”（3月6日）就种了一块试验田。公社组织几百人来参观，可是，第二天遇到了一场重霜，把秧头都打焦了。当时，部分人不相信这些秧苗还能成活，有些富裕农民乘机在群众中散布“杭嘉湖地区，无霜期短，不宜种双季稻。蒸汽育秧不能高产”等谬论，企图否定蒸汽育秧。就在这个紧张关头，公社党委直接领导我们挽救秧苗，党委书记深入田间和社员一起研究措施，发现灌水能保苗，就天天车水，经过五天时间，秧苗就转青了，生长得比一般水稻旺盛。这时候，公社党委又给我们指出，这是战胜困难的第一步，今后要更加精心培育管理。同时，立即召开现场会，全面推广了蒸气快速育秧法，在广大干部和群众中破除了“惊蛰”不能插秧的迷信。夏收时，早稻一季平均亩产达八百斤，其中十三亩平均每亩达到一千一百三十二斤。没有党的正确领导，那能会获得丰收。其次，实践教育我们，搞技术革新必须人人动手，发动大家都来搞。比如在我们试制“土轮船”的时候，很多青年主动投入了这一工作，制螺旋桨没有铜，群众主动把家中的旧铜拿出来；有了原材料不会加工，机修厂的厂长亲自动手帮我们加工；小轮船机器不会安装，公社专门请了技术员帮助我们边研究边安装。经过八次试验，花了四个月时间，土轮船就试制成功了。
    各位代表，在这持续大跃进的时代里，形势逼人。我们虽然取得了一些成绩，但离党对我们的要求还相差很远。1960年，我们为了实现粮食、畜牧、蚕桑生产三大丰收，各行各业全面发展，基本改变面貌，当前正在试验土拖拉机，还准备利用渠道中机械排灌的水力和砖瓦窑的热量作动力进行发电。我们的口号是：“做什么，钻什么，革新什么”，“能洋就洋，不能洋先土”。今年一定要实现“耕田不用牛，运输不肩挑，蚕室照明、保暖电气化”的愿望。我们相信，在中央和毛主席的英明领导下，依靠人民公社，虚心向先进单位学习，不断革新，不断创造，我们一定能够实现今年的各项生产指标。
