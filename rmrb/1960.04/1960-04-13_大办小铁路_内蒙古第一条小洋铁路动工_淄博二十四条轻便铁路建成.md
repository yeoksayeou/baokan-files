    Greatly Develop Small Railways
    Inner Mongolia's First Small-Gauge Railway Begins Construction; Zibo Builds Twenty-Four Light Railways
    Xinhua News Agency report: The first small-gauge railway in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Sanji Line (from Sandaokan Station on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway to Jilantai), recently began construction. This railway is being built to develop the Jilantai Great Salt Lake. Jilantai salt reserves are extremely rich. After the Sanji Line opens to traffic, it can replace a large number of camel and truck transport, and transportation costs will be greatly reduced. It is estimated that the entire investment in the construction of this railway can be recovered in less than half a year after it opens.
    This line is more than 140 kilometers long, starting from Sandaokan, going north along the Helan Mountains at an altitude of 1,300 meters, and then crossing the southern part of the Ulan Buh Desert westward to reach Jilantai. The construction project is relatively arduous.
    Xinhua News Agency report: Zibo City, Shandong Province, has built twenty-four local and foreign-style light railways of various types, with a total length of 120 kilometers; sixteen self-made locomotives, and 4,937 various types of carriages participating in these railway transport. The daily transport volume has reached 44,000 tons, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.
    Zibo City's light railways are all built in places with large transport volumes, concentrated materials, and close to railway stations. These railways require less investment, are quick to build, easy to obtain materials locally, can run day and night, are impervious to wind and rain, have high transport capacity, and low freight rates. For example, the small railway of combined local and foreign methods, five kilometers long, from Shuangshan Coal Mine to Boshan Railway Station, can now replace the transport capacity of 900 handcarts every day. The freight per ton of coal is reduced by 80% compared to the past, and the entire investment in this railway can be recovered in five months. The large-scale local railway spur lines built in Zibo City have a particularly significant effect. It can enable locomotives and vehicles running on the main railway line to directly transport materials into or out of factory and mining sites through the spur line, reducing the loading and unloading processes during the transfer process with small locomotives or other tools, greatly saving loading and unloading labor and time.
    The local light railways built in Zibo City are cast from locally produced high-sulfur iron. This type of rail is flat, straight, smooth, and uniform, with few sand holes and high pressure resistance. The operating situation over the past year has proven that it is suitable for both winter and summer.

    内蒙古第一条小洋铁路动工  淄博二十四条轻便铁路建成
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区第一条小洋铁路三吉线（由包兰路三道坎车站到吉兰泰），在最近动工兴建。这条铁路是为了开发吉兰泰大盐池而修建的。吉兰泰盐的蕴藏量极为丰富。三吉线通车以后，可以代替大批骆驼和汽车运输，运输费用将大大降低。据计算，通车后不到半年，就可以收回修建这条铁路的全部投资。
    这条线路共长一百四十多公里，从三道坎起，沿着拔海一千三百米的贺兰山北上，然后向西横穿乌兰布和大沙漠的南部到达吉兰泰，建设工程较为艰巨。
    据新华社讯　山东省淄博市已经建成各种类型的土洋轻便铁路二十四条，全长一百二十公里；自制机车十六台，参加这些铁路运输的各种车厢有四千九百三十七辆，每日运量已经达到四万四千吨，有力的支援了工农业生产。
    淄博市的轻便铁路都修建在运量大、物资集中，接近火车站的地方。这些铁路投资少，建设快，易于就地取材，可以昼夜行驶，风雨无阻，运输能力高，运费低。如由双山煤矿通往博山火车站全长五公里的土洋结合的小铁路，现在每天可以代替九百辆手推车的运力，每吨煤的运费比过去降低80％，五个月即可收回这条铁路的全部投资。淄博市修建的大型的土铁路专用线，作用尤为显著。它可以使大铁路上行驶的机车车辆通过专用线，将物资直接运进或运出厂矿场地，减少用小型机车或其他工具倒运过程中的装卸工序，大大节省装卸劳力和时间。
    淄博市修建的地方轻便铁路用当地生产的高硫铁铸造的，这种路轨又平又直又光又齐，砂眼少，耐压力高，一年来的运行情况证明，冬天夏天都适用。
