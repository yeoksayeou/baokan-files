Cooperating with Iron Mines to Promote the Leap Forward of Steel and Coal
    Shanxi Coal Mines Operate Iron Factories

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 20th dispatch) State-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province are cooperating with iron mines. The iron mines support the coal mines with iron ore, and the coal mines support the iron mines with coal. This enables places with coal but no iron, and places with iron but no coal, to produce iron, greatly promoting the development of the steel and coal industries.

    The Datong Coal Mine was the first to cooperate with its coal user - Baotou Iron Mine. Now, the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, Yangquan Coal Mine, and the small and medium-sized iron mines such as Gujiao Iron Mine in Taiyuan suburbs, Mengxian Iron Mine, and Jiexiu Liangjiageta Iron Mine have all established cooperation. The Datong Coal Mine has also cooperated with the Xuanhua Iron Mine in Hebei, while the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine and Yangquan Coal Mine have partnered with the provincial iron mines in Hubei Province, such as Fenghuangshan Iron Mine, Xileishan Iron Mine, and Tiezishan Iron Mine. The Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine has also established connections with the people's communes nearby that mine iron ore. This year, these interconnected units plan to mutually support each other with over 90,000 tons of coal and over 60,000 tons of iron. The cooperation between coal mines and iron mines has vigorously promoted the development of pig iron production in the coal mine system. In February this year, the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine put a 32-cubic-meter small blast furnace into production, and in March another 32-cubic-meter blast furnace was put into production. The Datong Coal Mine has also built two 30-cubic-meter blast furnaces simultaneously. The Yangquan Coal Mine already had an 8-cubic-meter small blast furnace, and recently built a medium-sized 100-cubic-meter blast furnace. In 1958, only large coal mines such as Datong, Yangquan, and Taiyuan Xishan in the Shanxi Province state-owned coal mine system had established small blast furnaces. Now, the coal and iron enterprises of Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine and Datong Coal Mine have developed into small-scale iron and steel complexes. Small coal mines such as Fenxi, Xuangang, Linfen, and Luan have also built medium and small blast furnaces and started producing pig iron.

    With steel plants in the coal mine system, production and construction can leap forward more effectively. The Luan Coal Mine used the iron it refined to cast iron rails and build a network of local railways in the mining area, completely changing the situation of people carrying, picking, and carrying coal on their backs, thereby increasing coal mine production efficiency by 40%. The Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine used the iron it refined to cast large machine tools and process equipment parts for coal mining machinery itself. This ensured timely replacement and good maintenance of mechanical equipment parts, greatly improving the utilization rate of equipment.

    同铁矿挂钩协作　促钢煤共同跃进
    山西煤矿办铁厂
    本报太原20日电　山西省各国营煤矿同铁矿挂钩协作，铁矿支援煤矿铁矿石，煤矿支援铁矿煤炭，使有煤无铁、有铁无煤的地方都能生产铁，大大促进了钢铁和煤炭工业的发展。
    大同煤矿最先同自己的供用煤户——包头铁矿挂钩。现在，太原西山煤矿、阳泉煤矿和太原郊区古交铁矿、盂县铁矿、介休梁家圪塔铁矿等中小型铁矿挂了钩。大同煤矿和河北宣化铁矿、太原西山煤矿、阳泉煤矿和湖北省的凤凰山铁矿、西雷山铁矿、铁子山铁矿等省营铁矿挂了钩。太原西山煤矿还和附近开采铁矿的人民公社建立了联系。这些相互挂钩的单位，今年计划互相支援煤九万多吨，铁六万多吨。煤矿同铁矿挂钩有力地促进了煤矿系统生铁生产的发展。太原西山煤矿今年2月份有一座三十二立方的小高炉投入生产，3月份又一座三十二立方的高炉投入生产。大同煤矿同时建立了两个三十立方的高炉。阳泉煤矿原来已有一座八立方的小高炉，最近又兴建了一座一百立方的中型高炉。1958年，山西省国营煤矿系统只有大同、阳泉、太原西山等大型煤矿建立了小高炉，现在，太原西山煤矿和大同煤矿的煤铁企业，已向小型钢铁联合企业发展。汾西、轩岗、临汾和潞安等小型煤矿，也都建起了中型和小型的高炉，开始生产生铁。
    煤矿系统有了钢铁厂以后，生产、建设能更好地跃进。潞安煤矿用自己炼出的铁铸成铁轨，修建了矿区土铁路网，彻底改变了人抬煤、挑煤、背煤的状况，煤矿生产效率因而提高了40％。太原西山煤矿用自己炼的铁铸成大型机床，自己加工煤矿机械的设备部件。使机械设备部件换的及时，维修的也好，设备利用率大大提高。
