Chairman! Fellow representatives! Fellow members!

I listened with great excitement to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and also read Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. These three reports presented us with an incomparably magnificent picture of continued leap forward. After listening to these reports, each of us will feel 120,000 times excited and moved by our country's great achievements in socialist construction, and will also be full of infinite confidence and determination in the magnificent prospects of future construction. I would like to express my warmest and heartfelt support for these three reports.

On the opening day of this conference, during a break, Chairman Mao asked me: "Do you think this plan can be completed?" I replied with full confidence: "It can be completed, I dare to guarantee that it can be completed and overfulfilled." What do I base my guarantee on? What makes me dare to guarantee that this year's national economic plan will be completed and overfulfilled?

First, there is the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the incomparably superior socialist system. The general line for socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, based on the laws of social development and centrally reflecting the fundamental interests and ardent wishes of China's 650 million people, has fully mobilized all positive factors in the country. Under the guidance of the Party's general line, the broad masses of the people are more closely united around the Party, and their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm are higher. Around this general line, the Party has also put forward a set of "walking on two legs" policies, which has opened up a broad world for the broad masses of the people to exert their strength, which provides an important guarantee for the high-speed and sustained leap forward of the national economy. The Great Leap Forward also fully demonstrated the incomparably superior socialist system. For example, the organizational form of the people's commune was produced in the Great Leap Forward, which in turn promoted the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and the Great Leap Forward in the entire national economy. Last year, our country encountered natural disasters unprecedented in decades, with disaster areas accounting for 30% of the total sown area. Such severe natural disasters, if they had occurred before liberation or in capitalist countries, would have left countless people displaced and starving. However, under the leadership of the Party, hundreds of millions of farmers, relying on the great superiority of the organizational form of the people's commune, overcame the natural disasters, proving that man can conquer nature, and still achieved a leap forward in agricultural production. With the correct leadership of Party and the incomparably superior socialist system, and having found the three magic weapons of socialist construction, our country has a fundamental guarantee for realizing the high-speed and continuous leap forward of the national economy. Opening the newspaper every day, we can hear the footsteps of a Great Leap Forward. Last November, I visited the Minhang Industrial Zone in Shanghai and felt deeply moved. I am an old Shanghai resident and am very familiar with the Minhang area. In the past, there were only some simple small factories, dilapidated thatched and tile houses, and narrow, winding streets. When I went there last year, Minhang had completely changed, and I could hardly recognize it. I saw a wide and broad street, with brand-new tall buildings on both sides, and trees and flower beds interspersed among them. It was a new industrial zone, and also a garden city, a very moving scene. The surrounding area was full of newly built and expanded huge factories, with towering chimneys and rows of workshops. Ah! The changes are truly too great. The Minhang New Industrial Zone is a product of the Great Leap Forward. In fact, Shanghai has more than just one Minhang that has changed, and how many changes like Minhang are there across the country. Seeing these, how inspired we are!

Second, there is the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In leading our country's revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese revolution and construction. He correctly solved various problems in the Chinese revolution and construction. For example, reasonably resolving the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, has enabled the superstructure and the relations of production to continuously adapt to the development of the productive forces, opening up a broad road for the continuous development of the productive forces. The best proof is that the Party and the people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and based on our country's experience in socialist construction, found the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and realized an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in the national economy. Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible.

Third, there are 650 million people who have become socialists, a great productive force. I remember that in 1949, the year of national liberation, the then U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said in the "White Paper": "The population of China doubled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and therefore for China became an unbearable pressure. The first question every Chinese government must face is to solve the people's eating problem. Up to now, no government has succeeded." According to Acheson, China was hopeless. Because there were too many people, it was an "unbearable pressure"; only by relying on American flour, that is, becoming an American colony, could there be a way out. The facts of the past ten years have proven that China's large population is precisely a great thing. Under the leadership of the Party, we have indeed created a miracle in the world. The decisive factor in the Great Leap Forward is people, because people are the most active factor in the productive forces. The liberated 650 million Chinese people, under the socialist system, have become the masters of society and control their own destiny. The intelligence and talents hidden in the masses have burst forth, becoming an incomparably powerful force. The working people are exerting increasingly high levels of enthusiasm and creativity, promoting the high-speed development of production and construction. To give an example, in recent years, factories and mining enterprises in Beijing have cultivated and selected more than 3,700 engineering and technical personnel from among the workers, including nearly 200 engineers. Their original cultural level and technical theoretical level were relatively low, but based on a sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction, they listened to the Party, studied tenaciously, dared to uphold the truth, boldly innovated, went deep into reality, and closely united with the masses, playing a great role in production and becoming an important backbone for promoting the leap forward in production. People who have mastered their own destiny will unleash immeasurable power.

Fourth, there is the foundation of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years. I remember that in my speech at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress last year, I stated that it was absolutely possible to have a continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Now, the conditions are even better, and it is of course entirely possible to have a continued Great Leap Forward in 1960. After the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We have a more solid technical and material foundation than in the past, accumulated richer experience than in the past, cultivated more construction talents than in the past, and have the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. All of these are favorable conditions for us to achieve sustained leap forward.

Fifth, there are more and more people involved in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and more and more urban housewives are being liberated from housework, becoming an unprecedented mass movement. The vivid examples of technical innovation and technical revolution are surging in every region and every post, which can be said to be a characteristic of this era. Just take the large amount of natural gas recently extracted in Chuansha County, Shanghai, where I grew up. Its industrial use, agricultural use, domestic use, and transportation use can almost achieve "cultivating land without oxen, lighting lamps without oil." This is just a small example. How many regions across the country are engaged in the great cause of conquering nature and changing nature. The upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement across the country has extremely profound and great significance, not only providing an important guarantee for completing this year's national economic plan and realizing the sustained and comprehensive leap forward in the future, but also paving the way for our country to realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture at high speed. Now, in cities across the country, the movement of running urban communes on a large scale, running street industries on a large scale, and running collective welfare and service undertakings on a large scale is flourishing, liberating a large number of housewives from housework and putting them into the country's economic construction. This is a large and potential new force in the Great Leap Forward. Taking Xicheng District in Beijing as an example, street industries began to be run in the second half of 1958. The initial output value was very small. Over the past year, street industries have developed rapidly. According to estimates for the first quarter of this year, the annual output value of street industries in this district this year can reach 360 million. The street industries in just one district, from nothing to development, from creation to development, have such considerable figures in just over a year, which is truly admirable and respectable.

Aren't all these enough to make me dare to guarantee the Great Leap Forward and the continued Great Leap Forward? This is the first thing.

The second thing, I believe that the East wind continuing to prevail over the West wind is not only possible, but also inevitable.

Since our country's socialist construction is so fast, it will not be a distant future for our country to basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and thus build a strong socialist country. It is already very certain that our country can catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in the 1960s. At the same time as our country's Great Leap Forward, the economic construction of other socialist fraternal countries is also advancing by leaps and bounds. Countless brilliant achievements have made the entire socialist camp full of spring. Now, the Soviet people have greatly overfulfilled the first year's plan of the Seven-Year Plan, and are striving to complete the magnificent Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule with vigorous labor enthusiasm. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union will definitely catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of major products calculated on a per capita basis. Other fraternal countries have also accelerated the pace of construction, and a prosperous scene of common high growth of socialist countries' economies in 1959 has emerged. The material and technical strength of socialist countries is also rapidly increasing. In particular, the Soviet Union sent three red cosmic rockets into the sky, climbed to a new peak of science and technology, and threw the United States far behind. On the political and ideological front, the Gaganova movement, the "Communist Labor Brigade" and the "Communist Shock Worker" movement in the Soviet Union are flourishing. The Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people and the Chollima Movement of the Korean people continue to move forward with great momentum, and the fraternal countries of Eastern Europe have also launched a mass movement to strive for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade." All of these demonstrate the strong will and revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all countries in the socialist camp. The unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have seen new upsurges. In capitalist countries, the people's peace movement has also gained widespread development.

In capitalist countries, the situation is just the opposite. The economic situation in capitalist countries is unstable and turbulent, forming a posture of curve climbing. The imperialist policies of aggression and war continue to fail, and internal contradictions are numerous. Please read all the materials in Section 7, Chapter 13, Volume 1 of Marx's "Capital," which are based on the records of British official documents from 1770 to 1867, nearly a hundred years. It can be seen that the British economy experienced prosperity and crisis, followed by revival, prosperity, and another crisis, revealing the law of capitalist economy tending to decline. Marx's conclusion in writing "Capital" was based on these situations. Recently, these situations in imperialist countries have become more serious, with more frequent ups and downs, and the economic crisis is deepening. In these days when the East wind is strong and the West wind is bleak, the socialist camp and the forces of peace and democracy around the world have greatly surpassed the war forces of imperialism. U.S. imperialism has been forced to make some gestures of peace, but at the same time, it continues to expand its military and prepare for war, which precisely shows that U.S. imperialism is in an increasingly isolated and difficult situation. As long as the socialist camp and all peace-loving and democratic forces around the world unite closely and struggle together, exposing the two-faced tactics of U.S. imperialism of fake peace and real war, we will definitely be able to completely crush all the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism. Peace will surely be guaranteed!

It is already very obvious that the socialist camp will increasingly surpass the imperialist camp, and the East wind will forever prevail over the West wind. This is the second thing.

Faced with these things, I feel even more the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, and the importance of us all having to study Mao Zedong Thought. I remember that Chairman Liu Shaoqi once pointed out in his book "On the Party": "Mao Zedong Thought is the continued development of Marxism in the national democratic revolution in the current era of colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries, and is an excellent example of the nationalization of Marxism." Therefore, Chairman Liu once called on the entire Party: "The important task now is to mobilize the entire Party to study Mao Zedong Thought, publicize Mao Zedong Thought, and arm our Party members and revolutionary people with Mao Zedong Thought, so that Mao Zedong Thought becomes a practical and irresistible force." Chairman Liu's words were spoken to Communist Party members, but now I feel that they are also applicable to members of democratic parties and the people of the whole country. It is especially necessary for members of our democratic parties to study Mao Zedong Thought, because only by studying Mao Zedong Thought can we transform our standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to be more in line with the needs of the Chinese revolution.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian made a brilliant analysis of Mao Zedong Thought in his report: "Comrade Mao Zedong expounded, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the idea of combining the theory of continuous revolution with the theory of stages of revolutionary development; the idea of continuously reforming the relations of production and the superstructure to promote the high-speed development of the productive forces; the idea of correctly handling contradictions among the people and mobilizing all positive factors; the idea of combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and that the development of socialist construction must take the path of 'walking on two legs'; the idea of developing the economy and ensuring supply, using 90% of the effort to develop production and 10% of the effort to obtain fiscal revenue; the idea that politics is the soul and commander of all work, firmly believing in the masses, and that all work must follow the mass line; and other ideas about socialist revolution and socialist construction, opening up broad paths for our country's economic work, financial work, and other aspects of work." These words deserve our great attention.

Most of the members of our China Democratic National Construction Association are national industrialists and businessmen. In this era of great leap forward in all aspects of the country, in addition to striving to make work achievements in our respective posts, we must also intensify our study of Mao Zedong Thought and transform ourselves. Chairman Mao once instructed our industrial and commercial circles to "understand the laws of social development and master their own destiny." Therefore, we are already planning and preparing, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, to launch the study of historical materialism soon, so that we can all theoretically understand the development of human society, that the inevitable demise of capitalist society and the inevitable victory of communist society are objective historical laws that do not shift with human will, thereby enhancing our confidence and actively becoming progressives and revolutionaries who accelerate the progress of human history.

Not long ago, when our China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly convened the National Congress, the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee explicitly instructed us to "take care of one end" and "lean to one side." The so-called "take care of one end" means that our national industrialists and businessmen should only take care of the interests of the country and the people, and the so-called "lean to one side" means that our national industrialists and businessmen should completely lean to the side of socialism. "Take care of one end" and "lean to one side" have become two deeply rooted and well-known phrases in the national industrial and commercial circles through the dissemination of the congress. Many industrialists and businessmen are already responding to the Party's call with active actions. I personally believe that with the development of our movement to study Mao Zedong Thought and study historical materialism in the future, the progress of our national industrialists and businessmen will definitely be able to transform themselves more seriously and make more contributions to the country's socialist cause.

Based on these, I see clearly that the various facts of the new China over the past ten years have correctly answered two questions:

1. The Great Leap Forward and the continued Great Leap Forward are possible and inevitable;

2. The East wind continuing to prevail over the West wind is possible and inevitable.

The current task of our democratic parties and industrial and commercial circles is to actively participate in labor practice, strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, and study historical materialism to transform our political positions and transform our worldviews.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the New China are striving to develop socialism at high speed and proportionally, making a Great Leap Forward and a continued Great Leap Forward, and marching towards communism.

### 大跃进、继续大跃进是可能的，而且是必然的；东风继续压倒西风是可能的，而且是必然的  全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、政协全国委员会副主席黄炎培在政协会议上的发言

    大跃进、继续大跃进是可能的，而且是必然的；东风继续压倒西风是可能的，而且是必然的
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、政协全国委员会副主席黄炎培在政协会议上的发言主席！各位代表！各位委员！
    我很兴奋地倾听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，又读了谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而奋斗的报告。这三个报告在我们面前展现了一幅无比宏伟的继续跃进的图画。听了这些报告，我们每一个人都会对我们国家在社会主义建设方面的伟大成就感到十二万分的兴奋和激动，也都会对今后建设的宏伟远景充满了无限的信心和决心。对于这三个报告，我首先表示最热烈的、衷心的拥护。
    在这次会议开幕的那一天，在会议休息时，毛主席问我：“你看，这计划能完成吗？”我满怀信心地回答：“能完成，我敢保证能完成并超额完成。”我根据什么？敢于保证今年的国民经济计划一定能够完成并超额完成呢？
    第一、有共产党和毛主席的英明领导和无比优越的社会主义制度。党中央和毛主席根据社会发展规律，并集中地反映我国六亿五千万人民的根本利益和热烈愿望而提出来的社会主义建设总路线，把全国的一切积极因素充分地调动起来了。在党的总路线的指引下，广大人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围，社会主义觉悟和热情更高了。围绕这条总路线，党又提出了一套“两条腿走路”的方针，为广大人民群众发挥自己的力量开辟了广阔的天地，这就为国民经济的高速度持续跃进提供了重要保证。在大跃进中，也充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。比如，人民公社的组织形式是在大跃进中产生出来的，它又反过来促进了农业的大跃进，促进了整个国民经济的大跃进。去年我国遭遇到几十年未曾有过的自然灾害，全国受灾面积占全部播种面积的三成。这样严重的自然灾害，如果发生在解放以前或者发生在资本主义国家里，不知将有多少万人流离失所，死于饥寒。但是，亿万农民在党的领导下，依靠人民公社这个组织形式的巨大优越性，战胜了自然灾害，人定胜天，使农业生产依然获得了跃进。有了党的正确领导和无比优越的社会主义制度，找到了社会主义建设的三大法宝，我国实现国民经济高速度的连续跃进就有了根本保证。翻开每天的报纸，都可以听到一片大跃进的脚步声。去年11月，我在上海参观了闵行工业区，感受很深。我是老上海，对闵行这一地区是很熟悉的。在过去，那里有的是一些简陋的小工厂，破旧的草房瓦房，街道狭窄，弯弯曲曲。去年去一看，闵行完全变了样，我简直认不出来了。只见一条又宽又广的街，两旁是崭新的高大的建筑，还有树木花台点缀其间，是新工业区，又是一座花园城市，景象十分动人，四周围许多是新建扩建的巨大工厂，烟囱高耸，厂房栉比。啊！变化真是太大了。闵行新工业区就是大跃进的产物，事实上，上海何止一个闵行有变化，全国又有多少像闵行那样的变化。看了这些，内心多么感奋！
    第二、有毛泽东思想的指导。毛主席在领导我国革命运动中，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践结合起来。正确地解决了中国革命和建设中的各种问题。比如，合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，就使上层建筑和生产关系不断地适应生产力的发展，为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。党和人民在毛泽东思想的指导下，根据我国社会主义建设的经验，找到了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，实现了国民经济的史无前例的大跃进，就是最好的证明。高举毛泽东思想的红旗，我们就无往而不胜。
    第三、有成为社会主义的六亿五千万人民这样一个伟大的生产力。我记得在1949年，全国解放的那一年，美国当时的国务卿艾奇逊曾经在“白皮书”中说过这样的一段话：“中国的人口，在十八、十九世纪中增加了一倍，因此对于中国成为一种不堪重负的压力。每一个中国政府必须面临的第一个问题，是解决人民的吃饭问题。到现在为止，没有一个政府成功。”按照艾奇逊的说法，中国是毫无出路的。因为人口太多了，是一种“不堪重负的压力”；只有靠美国的面粉，即是说变为美国的殖民地，才有出路。十年来的事实已经证明，中国的人口众多恰恰是一件极大的好事。我们已经在党的领导下，确确实实创造了人间的奇迹。大跃进的决定因素是人，因为，人是生产力最活跃的因素。解放了的六亿五千万中国人民，在社会主义制度下，成为社会的主人，掌握了自己的命运。蕴藏在群众中的聪明才智迸发出来，成为一股无比强大的力量。劳动人民发挥着越来越高的积极性和创造性，促使生产建设得到高速度的发展。举一个例子来说明，几年来，北京市各厂矿企业从工人中培养选拔了三千七百多名工程技术人员，其中有近二百名工程师。他们原来的文化水平和技术理论水平都较低，但基于一种对社会主义建设事业的责任感，他们听党的话，顽强地学习，勇于坚持真理，大胆革新，深入实际，同群众密切团结，在生产中发挥了很大的作用，成为推动生产跃进的重要骨干。掌握了自己命运的人民，是会发出不可估计的力量来的。
    第四、有过去两年连续大跃进的基础。记得在去年第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的大会发言中，我就表示过，在1958年大跃进之后，1959年来一个继续大跃进是绝对可能的。现在，条件更好了，1960年来一个继续大跃进，当然也是完全可能的。在过去两年连续大跃进以后，总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝更加深入人心了，我们有比过去更加雄厚的技术物质基础，积累了比过去更加丰富的经验，培养了比过去更多的建设人才，又有苏联和其他兄弟国家的友好援助，所有这些，都是我们实现持续跃进的有利条件。
    第五、有越来越多的人民投入到技术革新和技术革命的运动中去，有越来越多的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，成为规模空前的群众运动。技术革新、技术革命的生动事例，在每一地区每一岗位上汹涌澎湃地出现，可以说成为这个时代的特征。单就我所生长的上海市川沙县最近开采出来的大量天然气，工农业利用、生活利用、交通利用，几乎可以做到“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油”，这只是一个小小的例子。全国多少地区都在干着征服自然、改变自然的伟大业迹。在全国范围内掀起的技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮，有着极其深刻和伟大的意义，不仅为完成今年的国民经济计划和实现今后持续的全面的跃进提供了重要的保证，而且也为我国高速度地实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化开辟道路。现在，在全国城市中，大办城市公社，大办街道工业，大办集体福利和服务事业的运动正在蓬勃开展，把大批家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，投入到国家的经济建设中去。这是大跃进中一支潜力很大的生力军。即以北京市西城区而论，1958年下半年开始举办街道工业，初期产值很少，一年多来，街道工业迅速发展，据今年第一季度估算，今年这个区的街道工业产值全年可达三亿六。单单一个区的街道工业，从无到有，从草创到发展，在短短的一年多中，就有这样可观的数字，真是令人可敬可佩。
    所有这些，还不够使我敢于保证大跃进、继续大跃进吗？这是第一件事。
    第二件事，我认为，东风继续压倒西风不仅是可能的，而且是必然的。
    我国的社会主义建设速度既然这样快，那么我国要基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而建成一个强大的社会主义国家，也就决不是遥远的将来的事了。我国可以在六十年代里在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，这已经是很有把握的事。与我国大跃进的同时，其他社会主义兄弟国家的经济建设也都在突飞猛晋。数不清的辉煌灿烂的成就，使整个社会主义阵营春色满园。现在，苏联人民已大大超额完成了七年计划的第一年计划，正以旺盛的劳动热情，争取提前完成宏伟的七年计划。在六十年代里，苏联肯定地将在按人口平均计算的主要产品产量方面，赶上和超过美国。其他的兄弟国家也都加快了建设速度，出现了1959年社会主义各国经济共同高涨的繁荣景象。社会主义各国的物质技术力量也在迅速增强，特别是苏联把三个红色宇宙火箭送上天，攀登了科学技术的新高峰，把美国远远地抛在后面。在政治思想战线上，苏联的加干诺娃运动、“共产主义劳动队”和“共产主义突击手”运动正蓬勃发展。我国人民的大跃进、朝鲜人民的千里马运动继续以磅礴的气势勇往直前，东欧的兄弟国家也掀起了争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的群众运动。所有这些，都表现出社会主义阵营各国人民的强烈意志和革命热情。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，日益巩固和发展。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动出现了新的高涨。资本主义国家里，人民的和平运动也获得了广泛的发展。
    在资本主义国家方面，情况恰恰相反。资本主义各国的经济情况，起落不定，动荡不安，形成了曲线爬行的姿态。帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策继续失败，内部矛盾重重。请读马克思资本论第一卷第四篇第十三章第七节所有资料都根据英国1770年到1867年的近一百年间官文书的记载，看出英国经济由繁荣而危机，而复兴，而繁荣，而又危机，大危机，暴露出资本主义经济一盛一衰趋于没落的规律性。马克思写资本论的结论，就根据这些情况。最近帝国主义国家这些情况越加严重，一起一落越加频繁，经济危机日益加深。在此东风劲吹、西风萧瑟的日子里，社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平民主的力量已经大大超过了帝国主义的战争势力，美帝国主义被迫做出了一些和平的姿态，但同时却继续扩军备战，这正说明了美帝国主义陷于越来越孤立和困难的境地。只要社会主义阵营和全世界一切爱好和平民主的力量紧密团结，共同斗争，揭露美帝国主义的假和平、真战争的两面手法，就一定能够彻底粉碎美帝的一切阴谋诡计。和平一定会得到保障！
    社会主义阵营将越来越胜过帝国主义阵营，东风要永远压倒西风，已经是很明显的事实了。这是第二件事。
    面对着这些事物，我更加感觉到毛泽东思想的伟大、正确，与我们大家必须学习毛泽东思想的重要性。我记得刘少奇主席曾经在“论党”这本著作中这样地指出：“毛泽东思想，就是马克思主义在目前时代的殖民地、半殖民地、半封建国家民族民主革命中之继续发展，就是马克思主义民族化的优秀典型。”因此刘主席曾经号召全党“现在的重要任务，就是动员全党来学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的党员和革命的人民，使毛泽东思想变为实际的不可抗御的力量。”刘主席的这番话是对共产党员说的，现在我觉得对民主党派的成员和全国人民来说，也是适用的。我们民主党派的成员，尤其有必要学习毛泽东思想，因为只有学习了毛泽东思想才能把我们的立场、观点、方法改造得更加符合中国革命的需要。
    李先念副总理在报告中把毛泽东思想作了精辟的分析：“毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义原理所阐明的关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想；关于不断改革生产关系和上层建筑，以促进生产力高速度发展的思想；关于正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动一切积极因素的思想；关于优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合，发展社会主义建设事业必须用‘两条腿走路’的思想；关于发展经济，保障供给，以90％的力量发展生产，以10％的力量取得财政收入的思想；关于政治是一切工作的灵魂和统帅，坚定地相信群众，一切工作必须走群众路线的思想；以及其他关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的思想，给我国的经济工作、财政工作以及其他各方面的工作开辟了广阔的道路。”这些话值得我们大大注意。
    我们中国民主建国会的大部分成员都是民族工商业者。处在国家正在各方面大跃进的这样一个时代里，我们除了要在各自的工作岗位上努力做出工作成绩外，也要加紧学习毛泽东思想，改造我们自己。毛主席曾经指示过我们工商界要“认识社会发展规律，掌握自己命运”。因此，我们已经在计划与准备，根据党中央的指示，不久以后即展开历史唯物论的学习，使我们大家能够从理论上认识人类社会的发展，资本主义社会必然灭亡、共产主义社会必然胜利是不以人的意志为转移的客观历史发展规律，从而增强自己的信心，主动地做一个加速人类历史进步的进步人士和革命者。
    不久以前，当我们中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会联合召开全国代表大会的时候，党中央领导同志曾经明确地指示我们要“顾一头”、“一边倒”。所谓“顾一头”，就是要我们全国工商业者只顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，所谓“一边倒”就是要我们全国工商业者完完全全地倒向社会主义这一边。“顾一头”、“一边倒”通过大会的传达，目前正在全国工商界中成为深入人心、家喻户晓的两句话。不少工商业者已经在用积极的行动响应党的这一号召。我个人相信，随着今后我们学习毛泽东思想，学习历史唯物论的运动的展开，我们全国工商业者的进步一定能够更加认真地改造自己，并为国家的社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。
    根据这些，我看清楚新中国十年来种种事实正确地解答了两个问题：
    一、大跃进、继续大跃进是可能的，而且是必然的；
    二、东风继续压倒西风是可能的，而且是必然的。
    我们民主党派和工商界当前的任务，就是要积极参加劳动实践，努力学习毛泽东思想，学习历史唯物论，来改造我们的政治立场，改造我们的世界观。
    新中国全国人民正在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，为高速度地又按比例发展地建设社会主义，大跃进、继续大跃进向共产主义迈进而奋斗。
