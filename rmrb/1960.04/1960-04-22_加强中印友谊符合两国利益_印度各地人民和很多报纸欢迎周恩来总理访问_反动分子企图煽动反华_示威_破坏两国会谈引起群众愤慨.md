Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st: Newspapers across India have published commentaries in recent days welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and expressing the hope that the current talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India will be successful, strengthening friendship between the two countries.

The "Free Press" of India published an editorial on the 19th, extending a sincere welcome to Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and expressing the hope that the Five Principles of Panchsheel would triumph.

The editorial stated that Premier Zhou Enlai of the great People's Republic of China is visiting India to peacefully resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute. The editorial said that an immediate peaceful resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute is the sincere desire of the freedom- and peace-loving people of India, as well as the hope of anti-imperialist and peace-loving people around the world. Premier Zhou Enlai is visiting India with a deep conviction and desire to achieve this goal.

The editorial condemned the conspiracies of reactionary parties such as the Indian People's League, the People's Socialist Party, and the Swatantra Party to undermine the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India.

The Malayalam-language "People's Century" said in its editorial on the 19th, "Zhou Enlai has come here to hold talks and resolve the (Sino-Indian border) dispute based on the Five Principles of Panchsheel." The editorial stated that both China and India and the people of the world hope that these talks will be successful.

The editorial emphasized Premier Zhou Enlai's statement at the National People's Congress that "We firmly believe that the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and India will eventually shine brightly." The editorial also expressed its firm belief that the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India will overcome difficulties and achieve results.

The editorial criticized the imperialists for using the Sino-Indian border issue "to create discord between Asian countries."

The "Kerala Kaumudi" said on the 20th that it is necessary for China and India to maintain friendly and close relations. It said that for India and China to make progress in construction, and for peace and happiness, "we sincerely hope that the Sino-Indian talks will be successful and that the eternal friendship between the two countries will last forever."

The newspaper pointed out that "imperialists who are afraid of the unity of Asian and African countries" have been using the Sino-Indian border dispute to provoke relations between India and China. The purpose of the imperialists and their followers "is to undermine the strong unity and harmony between Asian and African countries."

The newspaper condemned the anti-China actions of Indian reactionaries, saying that they "attempt to make India and China disagree, thereby making India join a certain group, which will only completely destroy India's neutral foreign policy." The newspaper also said that the anti-China elements also hope that the Nehru-Zhou Enlai talks will fail.

The "Mathrubhumi" of Kerala stated in its editorial on the 19th that it hopes that the border dispute between China and India should be resolved as soon as possible, and that the Prime Ministers of China and India should do their utmost to reach an agreement on the border issue.

The editorial condemned the anti-China behavior of the Indian People's League, the People's Socialist Party, and other reactionary parties. The editorial said that they are only showing "loyalty to the dollar. It is in the interests of American imperialists that India and China are not united."

Another Kerala newspaper, "Deshabhimani," said on the 19th that we, along with others, welcome the distinguished guest who represents the great Chinese people to visit India. The newspaper also hopes that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India will reach a reasonable agreement.

The Hindi newspaper "Naya Jeevan" of Lucknow said in its editorial on the 20th that it hopes that the talks between Nehru and Zhou Enlai will be successful. The newspaper said that there are many points of disagreement, but they must converge. "Because not only do peace-loving people all over the world hope for friendship between India and China, but the interests of both countries themselves also require peace and friendship between them. Therefore, we hope that the two Prime Ministers will sincerely work to seek a way out of the current situation in their talks."

The newspaper believes that although there are some difficulties on the Sino-Indian border, if the sentiments of goodwill and friendship prevail, these difficulties can be resolved.

The newspaper also opposes the so-called "Tibet issue" raised by those who attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. It said that Tibet is China's internal affair and no one has any reason to interfere in this issue.

"The National Herald" said in its editorial on the 19th that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India are very important. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India is widely welcomed in India. The editorial expressed the hope that the outcome of the talks will improve relations between China and India and ultimately lead to the resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue.

"Quami Awaz" published an editorial on the 19th stating that "Peace is needed for both China and India, because both countries hope to revitalize their countries and eliminate backwardness." However, the newspaper repeated the slander of Chinese "aggression."

"The Tribune" acknowledged that China is justified in taking the following attitude: that the Sino-Indian border is undemarcated and should be peacefully redrawn through talks in a friendly atmosphere based on the Five Principles of Panchsheel, and that the remnants left by imperialism are invalid. But this newspaper also repeated the fallacy of "Chinese expansionism."

Several major English newspapers such as "The Indian Express," "The Times of India," "The Hindustan Times," and "The Statesman," as well as some other right-wing newspapers, continue to spread pessimistic views about the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks, and try their best to belittle the significance of Premier Zhou's visit and the warm sentiments of the Indian people in welcoming Premier Zhou.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st: Indian people have been gathering to support the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India on the border issue, hoping that the talks will be successful.

According to a report published by the "People's Century" of Kerala yesterday, the Kerala Electrical Workers' Union passed a resolution at a meeting to wish the Prime Ministers of China and India success in their talks. The resolution said that in this way, closer friendly relations can be developed between India and China. The news said that the meeting also paid tribute to Premier Zhou Enlai.

A gathering of thousands of people was held in Puri, Orissa, on the evening of the 19th. A resolution was passed at the meeting welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and hoping that the talks between the two Prime Ministers would be successful.

It is reported that people from all over India have expressed their indignation at the conspiracies of right-wing parties such as the People's Socialist Party and the People's League, as well as other reactionaries, to incite people to hold anti-China "demonstrations" and undermine the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India.

It is reported that in Lucknow, the People's Socialist Party and the People's League publicly posted slogans, clamoring to organize an anti-talks "demonstration" in Lucknow. However, the "demonstration" did not materialize because the organizers of this "march" found that people were not only not interested in it, but also angrily tore down almost all the reactionary slogans posted on the walls. Reactionaries who were sent out to incite the masses to hold anti-China "demonstrations" were ridiculed by the masses. At the same time, people gathered in groups on the streets to wish the Prime Ministers of China and India success in their talks.

According to the "Patriot" on the 19th, the People's Socialist Party held an anti-China rally in a large stadium in Calicut, Kerala, but only about fifty people participated. The anti-China rally held by the People's Socialist Party and the Democratic Congress Party in Cuttack on the evening of the 17th, despite extensive publicity beforehand, was only attended by thirty-three people.

    加强中印友谊符合两国利益
    印度各地人民和很多报纸欢迎周恩来总理访问
    反动分子企图煽动反华“示威”破坏两国会谈引起群众愤慨
    新华社新德里21日电　连日来，印度各地报纸发表评论欢迎周恩来总理访问印度，并且表示希望目前中印两国总理的会谈成功，加强中印之间的友谊。
    印度“自由报”19日发表社论，对周恩来总理访问印度表示真诚的欢迎，希望潘查希拉五项原则得到胜利。
    社论说，伟大的中华人民共和国的总理周恩来前来印度访问，是为了和平解决中印边界争端。社论说，立即和平解决中印边界争端，是爱好自由和和平的印度人民的真诚意愿，也是世界各国反对帝国主义和爱好和平的人民的希望。周恩来总理正是抱着达到这个目的的深刻的信念和意愿前来访问印度的。
    社论谴责印度人民同盟、人民社会党和自由党这些反动政党破坏中印两国总理会谈的阴谋。
    马拉雅兰文的“人民世纪报”19日的社论说，“周恩来到这里来是为了举行会谈和根据潘查希拉五项原则解决（中印边界）纠纷的。”社论说，中印两国和全世界人民都希望这次会谈获得成功。
    社论强调周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上说的“我们深信，中印两国人民的传统友谊终将放出灿烂的光芒”这句话。社论还表示深信中印两国总理的会晤会克服困难，获得成果。
    社论指责，帝国主义者利用中印边界问题“在亚洲国家之间制造不和”。
    “喀拉拉月光报”20日说，中印两国保持友好和亲密的关系是必要的。它说，为了印度和中国在建设方面能够取得进展，为了和平和幸福，“我们衷心希望中印会谈能够成功，愿两国之间的永恒的友谊长存。”
    这家报纸指出，“对亚非国家的团结而感到害怕的帝国主义者”一直在利用中印边界争端挑拨印度和中国的关系。帝国主义者和他们的追随者“的目的是要破坏亚非国家之间的强有力的团结和融洽。”
    这家报纸在谴责印度反动分子的反华行动时说，他们“企图使印度和中国不和，从而使印度参加某一集团，这只会彻底破坏印度的中立外交政策。”这家报纸又说，反华的家伙们还希望尼赫鲁和周恩来的会谈会失败。
    喀拉拉邦“爱国者报”在19日的社论中表示希望，中印之间的边界纠纷应当尽快解决，中印两国总理应尽最大的力量就边界问题达成协议。
    社论谴责印度人民同盟、人民社会党和其他反动党派的反华行为。社论说，他们只是向“美元表示忠诚。印度和中国不团结是符合美帝国主义者的利益的。”
    另一家喀拉拉邦报纸“新生活报”在19日说，我们同其他的人一道，欢迎代表伟大的中国人民前来印度访问的贵宾。这家报纸也希望中印两国总理的会谈能够达成合理的协议。
    勒克瑙的印地文报纸“新生活报”20日在社论中表示希望尼赫鲁和周恩来的会谈得到成功。这家报纸说，现在存在着许多分歧点，但是他们必须拢靠。“因为，不仅全世界爱好和平的人们希望印度和中国之间友好，而且两国自身的利益也要求它们之间和平和友好。因此，我们希望两位总理在他们的会谈中将真诚地致力于寻求摆脱目前局面的途径。”
    这家报纸认为，虽然中印边界上有某些困难，然而如果亲善和友好的情绪占上风，这种困难也是可以解决的。
    这家报纸还反对那些企图干涉中国内政的人所提出的所谓“西藏问题”。它说，西藏是中国的内政问题，任何人都没有理由干涉这个问题。
    “国民先驱报”在19日的社论中说，中印两国总理的会谈是非常重要的。周恩来总理访问印度这件事受到印度广泛的欢迎。社论表示希望会谈的结果会使中印两国的关系得到改善，并且最后会导致中印边界问题的解决。
    “团结报”19日发表社论说，“和平对于中印两国都是需要的，因为两国都希望复兴自己的国家，并且消除落后状态。”但是，这家报纸重复所谓中国“侵略”的谰言。
    “光荣报”承认，中国采取下面这种态度是有道理的：即中印边界是未经划定的，应当通过会谈在以潘查希拉原则为基础的友好气氛中以和平方式重新划定，帝国主义遗留下的残余是无效的。但是这家报纸也重复所谓“中国扩张主义”的谬论。
    “印度快报”、“印度时报”、“印度斯坦时报”、“政治家报”等几家英文大报和其他一些右派报纸仍继续散布中印总理会谈的悲观论调，竭力贬低周总理访问的意义和印度人民欢迎周总理的热烈情绪。
    新华社新德里21日电　印度人民纷纷集会支持中印两国总理就边界问题举行会谈，希望会谈成功。
    据喀拉拉邦“人民世纪”昨天发表的一则消息说，喀拉拉邦电气工人联合会在一个集会上通过决议，祝中印两国总理会谈成功。决议说，这样，印度和中国之间就可以发展更加密切的友好关系。消息说，会议还向周恩来总理致敬。
    奥里萨邦的普里19日傍晚举行了千人集会。会上通过决议欢迎周恩来总理到印度访问并希望两国总理会谈成功。
    据报道，印度各地人民对人民社会党，人民同盟等右翼政党和其他反动分子企图煽动人们举行反华“示威”，破坏中印两国总理会谈的阴谋，表示愤慨。
    据报道，在勒克瑙人民社会党和人民同盟曾公开贴出标语，叫嚷要在勒克瑙组织反对会谈的“示威”。但是“示威”没有举行成，因为这个“游行”的组织者们发现，人们对此不但不感兴趣，而且愤怒地把贴在墙上的反动标语差不多全部撕掉了。被派出去煽动群众举行反华“示威”的反动分子遭到了群众的嘲笑。同时，人们成群结队的在街头举行集会，祝中印两国总理会谈成功。
    据19日的“爱国者报”报道，人民社会党在喀拉拉邦卡利卡特一个很大的体育场上召开反华集会，但只有寥寥五十来个人参加。人民社会党和民主大会党17日傍晚在克塔克举行的反华集会，尽管事先曾大肆宣传，但只有三十三个人参加。
