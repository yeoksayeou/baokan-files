Comrades,

I fully agree with the work reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my practical work. Now, I would like to briefly report to the congress some of my experiences in seed research.

I grew up in a poor peasant family. Before liberation, my father farmed for landlords, and my mother worked as a servant in a landlord's house. My father pieced together enough money to send me to school for two years. We lived a miserable life of constant hunger and cold. After liberation, I was completely liberated politically, economically, and culturally. The Party raised my political consciousness and made me a glorious member of the Communist Party; the Party supported me in boldly experimenting with improved rice varieties, cultivated me from a semi-literate young peasant into a seed selection expert, helped me write books, and the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences even hired me as a special researcher. I deeply realize how great the Party is and how happy the youth of the Mao Zedong era are! Without the Communist Party, there would be no Yang Kuangbao.

Selecting and breeding improved varieties is an important part of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. The facts of past years have proven that it is a labor-saving and highly effective measure for increasing production. "After a thousand calculations, selecting improved varieties is the most cost-effective," "Improved varieties yield high production," "Select seeds every year, and production increases year after year. A seed revolution leads to a great leap in production." These are all conclusions drawn by the masses after practice. For example, the early rice improved variety "Lucai No." has an average of 125 grains per穗, while the inferior variety "Xiaoshu Bai" has an average of 35 grains per穗. The late japonica rice "Hongmang Wan," introduced in 1958, has an average of about 200 grains per穗, with the largest穗 having 562 grains, while the inferior late indica rice "Zhonggan Yexiakeng" has an average of only 55 grains per穗. According to the average yield statistics over the past few years: "503" yields 50 jin per mu more than "Zaobai"; "Youmang Shajing" yields 85 jin per mu more than "503"; later, the selection of "Nante No." yielded 94 jin per mu more than "503"; "Dajing Bai" yields 30 jin per mu more than "Zhonggan"; "Aijiao Mangzui" yields 45 jin per mu more than "Dajing Bai"; "Wuzui Nuo" yields 62 jin per mu more than "Dajing Bai". In 1959, due to the complete selection of improved varieties such as "Wuzui Nuo," "Sanbaili," and "Xin Taihu Qing" for early and late rice, a large-scale increase in production was achieved, with the average yield per mu leaping to 1,800 jin. The facts of the bumper harvest fully prove the truth that improved varieties yield high production.

Over the past eight years, our commune has continuously increased the area of improved varieties and replaced them with superior varieties through seed selection and breeding, and the yield per unit area has increased year by year. It was 736 jin in 1952, 1,081 jin in 1957, jumped to 1,390 jin in 1958, and jumped again to 1,814 jin in 1959. In terms of seed quality, the seeds after selection are full, have a high thousand-grain weight, germinate quickly, grow well, have uniform heading, mature consistently, and have fewer weeds and impurities, which also greatly contributes to increasing production.

Although increased production from improved varieties is widely recognized by the masses, the process from not selecting seeds to selecting seeds, and from selecting seeds to breeding seeds, is also a very complex struggle between new and old ideas.

In 1952, all the early rice in our Luqiao Cooperative in Huangyan County was "Zaobai," and most of the late rice was local varieties such as "Xigan Jingren." At that time, I bought a few jin of early rice "503" and late rice "Cugan Bai" and other improved varieties from other places, but I was satirized and attacked by a few people. They said that my careful selection of seeds was "reciting Buddhist beads" and "not digesting food, wasting effort." After the seeds were sown in the field, I went to the field to observe three times a day, and they said that I was "a monkey planting ginger, looking three times a day." However, the Party educated me and encouraged me to persevere in the experiment. As a result, "503" and "Cugan Bai" yielded 95 jin and 66 jin per mu more than the local varieties, respectively. In the face of the facts of increased production, many people began to realize the benefits of seed selection, but some still believed that increased production was an accident. The following year, I continued the experiment. At that time, an old farmer also engaged in "experiments" to compete with me, and as a result, I harvested 180 jin per mu more than him. He admitted defeat and took the initiative to transfer more than 100 jin of improved varieties from me. This made the masses more convinced of the benefits of breeding improved varieties. They compiled a jingle: "Advanced and backward are all sealed, facts determine victory; old experience cannot defeat new methods, improved varieties are sure to win over inferior varieties."

The facts of increased production from improved varieties aroused the masses' attention to seed selection. However, many people still had ideological resistance to persisting in seed selection every year. Some people were afraid of trouble, saying that seed selection was too time-consuming. So I took the lead in selecting 220 jin of穗 selected seeds myself. The following year, I compared the穗 selected seeds with the non-穗 selected seeds. The results of the穗 selection showed that the yield of continuous cropping of late rice was 486 jin per mu, which was 51 jin more than the non-穗 selected seeds. At that time, I immediately organized the members of the cooperative to visit the site and seized this fact to carry out field rectification, debating "whether to select seeds?" and "Is it cost-effective to put effort into seed selection?" After seeing the fields and calculating the accounts, everyone realized that one day could select seeds for two mu of land, and two mu of land could increase production by 50 to 100 jin, and one labor could harvest 30 to 50 jin more. Through methods such as seeing, comparing, calculating, and debating, the masses deeply realized that seed selection is a magic weapon for increasing production, and the idea of increasing production with improved varieties took root in people's minds. From then on, the masses paid more and more attention to seed selection.

After communization, in order to breed improved varieties at high speed to meet the needs of the continuous Great Leap Forward in production, the commune decided to change the Luqiao Cooperative into a commune seed farm. The task of breeding improved varieties was heavier, and the quality requirements were higher. Some members had the "suffering loss theory" for seed selection, advocating self-selection and self-breeding, and were unwilling to support other places. Some said: If we all do seeds, what about food rations? Others believed that self-breeding had good quality, but all the rice sent out would be of poor quality when returned. Why bother eating rice that no one eats? At this time, the farm's Party branch carried out patriotic and community-loving education, mobilizing the masses to promote the spirit of communist cooperation, and at the same time publicized the state's policy of increased price exchange and sale of improved varieties, thereby eliminating various concerns. Under the encouragement of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in order to continuously create and cultivate better varieties, the Party branch put forward the grand slogan of "marching towards thousand-grain穗 and ten thousand-grain斤" to the broad masses. After more than half a year of efforts, ten thousand-grain斤 has been created by us, and further experiments and small-scale promotion are now underway.

There are many difficulties on the road to marching towards seed science. Under the leadership and continuous education of the Party, we have not been intimidated by temporary difficulties, but have been inspired to work harder to overcome them. For example, when I was breeding the new variety "Da Wuzui Nuo," the ripening season was late, and other rice had already headed, but "Da Wuzui Nuo" was still empty-stemmed, and some ideologically conservative people started to spread rumors. I remained unwavering, and finally succeeded in cultivating it. For example, female communist party member Fang Yue'e failed more than 20 times in a row when she started learning seed hybridization due to unfamiliarity with the operation, but she still persisted in the experiment and continued to improve the operation technology, and finally broke through the technical barrier. For example, Comrade Cai Renjun selected a large rice穗 from the Xin Taihu Qing rice seed in 1958. In 1959, he carried out single-plant breeding, with an average of more than 280 grains per穗, and the highest穗 reached 632 grains, with particularly strong resistance to diseases, insect pests and lodging. In terms of rice hybridization, only two methods are generally known: one is to soak the male flowers in 40-degree warm water to kill them, and the other is to cover them with black paper bags. However, we have successfully experimented with artificial insemination hybridization and distant hybridization, and rice blind mutant hybridization, which has a very good effect.

To carry out the seed technology revolution, it is not enough to rely on a few people alone, but we must rely on the broad masses and carry out mass movements on a large scale. And the experimental results that have been obtained should be quickly popularized. For example, in 1957, cooperative member Chen Jinbao discovered a large rice head in the "Hongmao" rice field. We immediately organized cadres and cooperative member technicians to visit the field and, after careful cultivation, it became the new variety "Luqiao No. 1." For example, cooperative member Li Zanging created an advanced method of first穗 selecting and then grain selecting when selecting rice seeds. The Party branch immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote it, which increased the seed selection efficiency several times. From 1952 to 1959, we created a total of 13 new varieties and bred 5 million jin of various high-yield improved varieties, of which more than 4 million jin were sold to the state and fraternal cooperatives. The late rice improved variety "Da Wuzui Nuo," selected in 1952, has been promoted to seven provinces and 52 counties. The early rice improved varieties "Lucai No.", "Railway Rice," and "Yuanfeng," which we have bred in large quantities, have also been widely promoted in various counties in the Wenzhou area. I and the scientific research team have also cultivated new varieties such as "Ten Thousand Grain斤", "Luqiao No. 1", and "Luqiao No. 9", which have paved the way for the future realization of 10,000 jin of rice per mu.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we must continue to hold high the red banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, make persistent efforts, and strive forward to achieve double thousand-grain穗 and six thousand-grain斤 in 1960, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialism.

The above speech, if there are any inappropriate points, please criticize and correct me. Finally, I wish all delegates good health.

### 为“千粒穗”“万粒斤”开道  杨匡保代表的发言

    为“千粒穗”“万粒斤”开道
    杨匡保代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理所作的工作报告，并保证在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在，我把自己从事种子研究工作的一些体会，向大会作简要汇报。
    我生长在一个贫苦农民的家庭里。解放前，父亲给地主种田，母亲在地主家当佣人，父亲东拼西凑，勉强地给我读了二年书，常年过着吃不饱、穿不暖的悲惨生活。解放后，我在政治上、经济上、文化上都翻了身。党提高了我的政治觉悟，使我成为一个光荣的共产党员；党支持我大胆试验改良水稻品种，把我从一个半文盲的青年农民培养成为选种专家，帮助我著书立说，浙江农业科学研究所还聘我为特约研究员。我深深体会到党是多么的伟大，毛泽东时代的青年是多么的幸福！有了共产党，才有我杨匡保。
    选育良种是农业生产八字宪法中的重要内容。历年来的事实证明，它是一项工本省、收效大的增产措施。“千算万算，选用良种最合算”，“良种出高产”，“种子年年选，产量节节高，种子大革命，生产猛飞跃”。这些，都是群众经过实践后所得出来的结论。比如，早稻良种“陆财号”，平均每穗一百二十五粒，而劣种“小暑白”平均每穗三十五粒。1958年引种的晚粳“红芒晚”，平均每穗都在二百粒左右，最大的穗头有五百六十二粒，而劣种晚籼“中秆叶下坑”平均每穗只有五十五粒。据几年来的平均产量统计：“503”比“早白”每亩增产五十斤；“有芒沙粳”比“503”每亩增产八十五斤；后来选用“南特号”又比“503”每亩增产九十四斤；“大荆白”比“中秆”每亩增产三十斤；“矮脚芒咀”比“大荆白”每亩增产四十五斤；“乌咀糯”又比“大荆白”每亩增产六十二斤。1959年早晚稻由于全部选用“乌咀糯”、“三百粒”、“新太湖青”等良种，获得了大面积的增产，平均每亩产量跃到一千八百斤。大丰收的事实，充分地证明了良种出高产的真理。
    八年来，我社由于选种育种，不断扩大良种面积和更换优良品种，单位面积产量一年比一年提高。1952年为七百三十六斤，1957年为一千零八十一斤，1958年跃为一千三百九十斤，1959年又跃到一千八百一十四斤。再拿种子的质量来说，经过选种的种子，子粒饱满，千粒重高，出苗快，生长好，抽穗整齐，成熟一致，稗草杂粒少，对提高产量的作用也很大。
    良种增产虽然为广大群众所公认，但是，从不选种到选种，从选种到育种，也是一场非常复杂的新旧思想斗争过程。
    1952年，我们黄岩县路桥合作社早稻全部是“早白”，晚稻大部是“细秆京仁”等土种，那时候，我从外地买来几斤早稻“503”、晚稻“粗秆白”等良种，却遭到少数人的讽刺打击，他们对我细心粒选种子，说是“念佛珠”、“吃饭不消化，消磨功夫”。种子下田以后，我一日三次到田头去观察，他们又说我是“猢狲种生姜，一日三次张”（看的意思）。但是，党教育我，鼓励我坚持试验下去，结果“503”和“粗秆白”分别比土种每亩多收九十五斤和六十六斤。在增产的事实面前，许多人开始认识选种的好处了，但是仍有人认为增产是偶然现象。第二年，我又继续试验，当时，有一个老农也搞了“试验”要与我比高低，结果，每亩产量我比他多收一百八十斤，他认输了，主动向我调去良种一百多斤。使广大群众对培育良种更加信服了。他们编了一首顺口溜：“先进落后大家封，事实面前分雌雄；老经验敌不过新办法，良种必定胜劣种”。
    良种增产的事实引起了群众对选种的重视，但是，坚持年年选种，不少人的思想还有抵触。有的人怕麻烦，说选种太费功夫。我就自己带头穗选了二百二十斤。第二年把穗选与不穗选的进行对比，穗选的结果，一季连作晚稻亩产四百八十六斤，比不穗选的多收了五十一斤，当时立即组织了社员去现场参观，抓住这个事实开展田头整风，辩论“要不要选种？”“功夫用在选种上到底合不合算？”大家看了田，又算了账：一天能选二亩田的种子，二亩田就可增产五十至一百斤，花一个工，就能多收三、五十斤。经过看、比、算、辩等办法，群众深刻地体会到选种是增产的大法宝，良种增产在人们思想上扎了根。从此群众就越来越重视选种了。
    公社化后，为了高速度繁育良种，满足生产不断大跃进的需要，公社决定把路桥社改为公社良种场，良种繁育任务加重，质量要求更高，有些社员存在选种“吃亏论”，主张自选自繁，不愿支援外地。有的说：全部做种子，口粮怎么办？也有人认为，自己繁育质量好，全部调出去，调回来的稻谷质量差，白米饭不吃，何苦？这时，农场党支部进行了爱国爱社的教育，动员群众发扬共产主义的协作精神，同时宣传国家对于良种加成调换和出售的政策，从而消除了种种顾虑。在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，为了不断创造培育更好的品种，党支部向广大群众提出“向千粒穗、万粒斤进军”的雄伟口号，经过半年多来的努力，万粒斤被我们创造出来了，现在进一步试验和小面积推广。
    在向种子科学进军的道路上，是有许多困难的。在党的领导和不断教育下，深苦钻研，我们并没有被一时的困难所吓倒，而是鼓起更大的干劲，去战胜困难。如我在培育“大乌咀糯”新品种时，由于成熟季节迟，其他稻已经抽穗了，“大乌咀糯”还是瘪秆，一些思想保守的就风言风语起来。我始终不动摇，最后终于培育成功。又如女共产党员方月娥开始学习种子杂交时，因操作不熟练，前后二十多次都失败了，但她仍坚持着试验，不断改进操作技术，终于攻破了技术关。再如蔡仁俊同志，在1958年从新太湖青稻种中选出一个大稻穗，1959年进行单本繁育，平均每穗在二百八十粒以上，最高一穗达六百三十二粒，抵抗病虫害和倒伏的能力特别强。在水稻杂交方面，一般只知道二种方法：一种是用四十度的温水泡死雄花，另一种是套黑纸袋，但是我们试验成功了人工授精杂交和远缘杂交，稻盲变异种杂交，效果很好。
    搞种子技术革命，光靠少数人干是不行的，必须依靠广大群众，大搞群众运动。并把已得的试验成果，迅速推广出去。如1957年社员陈金保在“红毛”稻田中发现大稻头，我们立即组织干部、社员技术员去田头参观，经过认真培育，成为“路桥一号”新品种。又如社员李赞卿在粒选稻种时，创造了先穗选，再粒选的先进方法，党支部立即召开现场会议推广，使选种效率提高数倍。从1952年至1959年我们共创造了十三个新品种，繁育了各种高产良种五百万斤，其中有四百多万斤售给国家和兄弟社。1952年选出的“大乌咀糯”晚稻良种，已经推广到七个省，五十二个县。我们大量繁育的早稻“陆财号”“铁路稻”“元丰”等良种，也已在温州地区各县普遍推广。我和科学研究组还培育出“万粒斤”“路桥一号”“路桥九号”等新品种，为将来实现亩产万斤稻开辟了道路。
    我们在党和毛主席的领导下，要继续高举党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，再接再厉，为1960年向双千粒穗、六千粒斤奋勇前进，为社会主义事业作出更大贡献。
    以上发言，不当之处，请各位代表批评指正。最后，祝各位代表身体健康。
