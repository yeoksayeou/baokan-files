　　Editor's Note:

　　After completing this special page, we can't help but feel excited: the pulse of our era is the strongest, and we can feel it everywhere. Isn't that so? These articles once again show us the wheels of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland are speeding forward, driving comrades in all positions to advance bravely, everyone full of vigor and high morale, each using various outstanding labors to weave together a magnificent picture of socialist construction that is rich, colorful, and brilliantly shining. How admirable, respectable, and lovable are the comrades in all walks of life and on all fronts of the motherland!

　　Since the eighth page of this newspaper opened the "In My Position" column this year, the number of submitted manuscripts has been very enthusiastic. People not only reported their work experiences, but also reflected the characteristics of various industries. The lines were filled with feelings of excitement and pride. Everyone loves their work, everyone believes that their work is an indispensable part of the motherland's socialist construction, and everyone diligently and creatively completes their tasks outstandingly. This is the spiritual outlook of the people of our era. Like our readers, we warmly welcome comrades from all regions, all ethnic groups, all industries, and all work positions to support this column, so that people can see the brilliance of our great era from these drops of water gathered from all directions!

    从一滴水中看时代的光彩
    编完这个专页，不由我们不激动地感到：我们这时代的脉搏是最强烈的，随处可以触到。不是吗？这几篇文章就又一次让我们看到了祖国大跃进的车轮在飞奔，带动着各个岗位上的同志们勇往直前，人人意气风发，个个斗志昂扬，各自用各种出色的劳动，交织成一幅丰富多彩、绚丽闪光的社会主义建设的雄伟图景。祖国各行各业各个战线上的同志们是多么可敬可佩可爱啊！
    本报第八版从今年起开辟了“在我这岗位上”这个专栏以后，投来的稿件非常踊跃。人们不仅报道出了自己的工作经历和经验，而且反映出了各行各业的特色，字里行间充满了兴奋自豪的感情。谁都热爱自己的工作，谁都认为自己的工作是祖国社会主义建设不可缺少的一环，谁都勤勤恳恳、而且创造性地出色完成任务。这就是我们这时代的人民的精神面貌。我们同读者一样，热烈地欢迎各个地区、各个民族、各个行业、各种工作岗位上的同志们，都来支持这一专栏，能使人们从这些四面八方汇集起来的水滴中，看到我们伟大时代的光彩！
