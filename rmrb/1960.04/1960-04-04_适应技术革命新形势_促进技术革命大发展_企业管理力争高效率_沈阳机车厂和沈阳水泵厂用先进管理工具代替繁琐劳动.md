This Newspaper Shenyang, 3rd. To adapt to the new situation of the technological revolution and to promote the great development of the technical revolution, the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Shenyang Water Pump Factory are launching a vigorous technical revolution in enterprise management.  They have achieved mechanization, electrification, scaling, generalization and simplification in management operations, liberating the vast number of enterprise management cadres and engineering technical personnel from tedious daily affairs, thereby greatly improving work efficiency and promoting the leap forward in production. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting to introduce and promote the experiences of these two factories.

Since the beginning of this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in these two factories have been progressing at a high speed, wave after wave. Workers' labor efficiency has soared, and production has doubled, urgently requiring a corresponding improvement in enterprise management level. After detailed analysis of the new situation in their factories, the Party committees of the two factories fully recognized the importance of solving this problem. However, they still had not found a way to improve the level of management. The revolution in design methods at the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute opened up their thinking. They analyzed in detail the situation of the factory in terms of production planning management, technical management, and business management, and found that the main contradiction in these management tasks was that a large amount of numerical calculation, data search, communication and liaison, copying and printing, and report procedures occupied most of the energy of management personnel and engineering technical personnel, and with the increase in production tasks, these tedious tasks also increased day by day. In response to this main contradiction, the Party committees of the two factories called on all workers to launch a vigorous technical revolution in enterprise management, advancing in the direction of scaling, electrification, mechanization, generalization, and simplification of management work. Thus, a vigorous mass movement of technical revolution in enterprise management was launched in these two factories. The workers of Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory used only ten days to realize more than two thousand innovation creations; Shenyang Water Pump Factory used fifteen days to realize more than one thousand two hundred innovation creations. In terms of production management, they innovated and created various electrified and scaled rapid calculation tools for calculating output, output value, quotas, equipment capacity, and task man-hours; in terms of technical management, they innovated and created analog computers, multi-purpose rapid calculation platforms, and slide rules for converting various complex formulas needed for design, technology, and quality inspection; in terms of business management, they innovated and created wage rapid calculators, cost rapid calculation platforms, and special slide rules for various economic indicators; in terms of data search, they also created many tables, rulers, and electrified query platforms for rapid data search; in terms of copying and printing, they created methods such as cut-and-paste, grid lining, and straight line drawing to replace manual copying and printing; in terms of communication and liaison, they created an electrified dispatching network. In this way, numerical calculation became scaled and electrified, data search became charted and mechanized, communication and liaison became electrified, copying and printing became generalized and mechanized, and report procedures became simplified and scientific.

Although the technical revolution in enterprise management in these two factories is not yet comprehensive, it has already shown its great role:

First, it greatly improves work efficiency, enabling technical personnel to free up more energy and time to go deep into the workshops to study and solve more important problems, and promotes the great leap forward in production. In the past, when the production section of Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory compiled ten-day and monthly operation plans, twelve planning dispatchers had to spend four hours each; after creating the rapid calculator for parts quantity and forged and cast products, it took only one or two hours to compile. In terms of cost calculation, in the past, only monthly costs could be calculated, and it was not possible to calculate them until the beginning of the next month at the earliest; after creating cost rapid calculation tools and reforming some reports, not only can monthly costs be calculated in a timely manner, but also ten-day and daily costs can be calculated, reflecting the economic activities of the workshop on the same day, making leadership work more proactive and able to discover problems more promptly. After creating tools such as universal drawings, electrical calculators, and multi-purpose calculation platforms, the entire staff of the capital construction equipment section has been reduced from fifty-three to thirty-four, and more than half of them can still regularly go deep into the front line. After the technical revolution in business management, the work efficiency of the design section of Shenyang Water Pump Factory has soared, not only solving the contradiction that new product design could not keep up with production needs, but also proposing the new goal of "completing the annual task in one quarter." The process sections of these two factories have also completely solved the old problem that process work could not keep up with the needs of the workshops, and achieved "completing half a day's task in half a day, and spending half a day in the workshop."

Second, it creates favorable conditions for further implementing the management system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." In the past, the biggest difficulty in the issue of workers' participation in management was that some workers had a relatively low level of education and could not calculate or write. This time, the creation of rapid calculation tools such as group accounting slide rules, man-hour quota slide rules, attendance rate rapid calculators, and material input rapid calculators, which workers can easily master; using these tools, the numbers come out in just a few minutes, which further stimulates workers' enthusiasm for participating in management. After realizing the mechanization and scaling of accounting work, the number of accounting indicators for groups in Shenyang Water Pump Factory increased from four to six in the past, and implemented the cost accounting of teams and groups, which had not been realized for a long time due to the complexity of the calculation.

Third, management work adapts to the needs of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, and overcomes the contradictions of imbalance and incompatibility between management work and production. Two-thirds of the technical personnel in the process section of Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory can now regularly go deep into the workshops and carry out technical innovations with the workers. Now, they are working with the workers to study fifty-nine major technical transformation projects. In addition, more than fifty engineering and technical personnel have been drawn to establish scientific research institutions. After a large number of management personnel and engineering and technical personnel are freed from general and complicated affairs, they can concentrate their efforts on conducting research on high, large, precise, sharp, and new technologies. With the close cooperation of the workers in the workshop, Shenyang Water Pump Factory spent only seven days to come up with the design of a giant water pump with a high level of technology. This factory has also drawn a group of technical forces to enrich the design and process research office, and successfully tested multi-stage and single-stage pumps with a diameter of less than ten inches, and carried out scientific research projects such as high speed.

    适应技术革命新形势  促进技术革命大发展
    企业管理力争高效率
    沈阳机车厂和沈阳水泵厂用先进管理工具代替繁琐劳动
    本报沈阳3日电　沈阳机车车辆厂和沈阳水泵厂职工大闹企业管理工作技术革命，在管理业务上实现了机械化、电气化、尺表化、通用化和简易化，使广大企业管理干部和工程技术人员从繁琐的日常事务中解放出来，从而大大地提高了工作效率，促进了生产的跃进。最近，中共辽宁省委召开现场会议，介绍、推广了这两个厂的经验。
    今年以来，这两个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，一直是一浪高一浪地高速度前进，工人劳动效率飞跃上升，生产成倍增加，迫切要求企业管理水平相应地提高。两个厂的党委，在详细分析了本厂新的形势以后，充分认识到解决这个问题的重要意义。但是，怎么样才能使管理水平提高？还是没有找到门路。沈阳铝镁设计研究院设计方法的革命，打开了他们的思路。他们详细地分析了工厂在生产计划管理、技术管理、经营管理等方面的情况，找出了这些管理工作上的主要矛盾是，大量的数字计算、查找资料、传递联系、抄写描印、表报手续等繁琐事务，占用了大部分管理人员、工程技术人员的精力，并且随着生产任务的增加，这些繁琐事务也日益增加。针对这个主要矛盾，两个厂的党委便号召全厂职工大闹企业管理技术革命，向管理工作尺表化、电气化、机械化、通用化、简易化的方向进军，于是这两个厂就掀起了蓬蓬勃勃的企业管理工作技术革命的群众运动。沈阳机车车辆厂职工只用了十天，就实现了两千多件革新创造；沈阳水泵厂用了十五天实现了一千二百多件革新创造。在生产管理方面，他们革新创造了计算产量、产值、定额、设备能力、任务工时等各种电气化和尺表化的速算工具；在技术管理方面，革新创造了设计、工艺以及质量检查等方面需要的模拟式计算机、多用速算台以及换算各种复杂公式的速算尺等；在经营管理方面，革新创造了工资速算器、成本速算台和各种经济指标的专用拉尺等；在查找资料方面，也搞出不少速查资料的表、尺、电气化查讯台等；在抄写描印方面，创造了剪贴法、衬格法、直画法等方法代替手工抄写描印；在传递联系方面，创造了电气化调度网。这样，就出现了数字计算尺表化、电气化，查找资料图表化、机械化，传递联系电气化，抄写描印通用化、机具化，表报手续简易化、科学化。
    这两个厂在企业管理上的技术革命，虽然还不够十分全面，但是，已经显示出它的巨大作用：
  第一、大大提高工作效率，使技职人员能够腾出更多精力和时间去深入车间研究解决更重大的问题，推动了生产大跃进。沈阳机车车辆厂生产科过去在编制旬、月作业计划时，十二名计划调度员每人得用四小时；创造了配件数量及锻铸品速算器以后，一、二个小时就编出来了。在成本计算方面，过去只能计算月成本，而且最早也得下月初才能算出来；创造了成本速算工具和改革了一些表报以后，不但可以及时算出每月的成本，也可以算出每旬、每日的成本，当天就反映出车间经济活动情况，使领导工作更加主动，更能及时发现问题。基建设备科创造出万能图、电气计算器、多用计算台等工具以后，全科人员已由五十三名减少到三十四名，还能做到一半以上的人经常深入现场。沈阳水泵厂设计科人员经过业务管理的技术革命，工作效率飞跃上升，不仅解决了新产品设计跟不上生产需要的矛盾，还提出“全年任务一季完”的新目标。这两个厂的工艺科也彻底解决了工艺工作跟不上车间需要的老问题，实现了“一天任务半天完，抽出半天下车间”。
    第二、为进一步贯彻“两参一改三结合”的管理制度创造了有利条件。过去在工人参加管理问题上，最大的困难是有些工人文化水平比较低，不能算写。这回创造出小组核算速算尺、工时定额速算尺、出勤率速算器、投料速算器等速算工具，工人很容易掌握；用这些工具，只要几分钟，数字就出来了，这就更加激发了工人参加管理的积极性。沈阳水泵厂实现了核算工作机具化、尺表化以后，小组的核算指标就由过去四个增加到六个，并实行了过去由于计算复杂长期未能实现的班组成本核算。
    第三、管理工作适应了大搞技术革命的需要，克服了管理工作与生产不平衡、不相适应的矛盾。沈阳机车车辆厂工艺科的技术人员，已经有三分之二都能经常深入到车间，和工人一起大搞技术革新。现在，他们正和工人一起研究五十九个重大技术改造项目。另外，还抽出了五十多名工程技术人员，建立了科学研究机构。大批管理人员和工程技术人员摆脱了一般繁杂事务工作以后，就能够集中精力，进行高、大、精、尖、新技术的研究工作。沈阳水泵厂在车间工人的密切配合下，仅用了七天的时间，就搞出了具有高度技术水平的巨型水泵的设计。这个厂还抽出了一批技术力量充实了设计和工艺研究室，并且试验成功了十寸口径以下的多级、单级泵，和进行高速化等科学研究项目。
