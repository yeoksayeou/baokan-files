Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The Japanese "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe returned to Tokyo on the evening of the 6th, after a two-month visit and performance tour in China.

　　Kawarasaki Chojuro, head of the "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe, said to the welcoming crowd at Haneda Airport that he believed this visit and performance would strengthen the friendly relations between the people of Japan and China.

　　He said that national culture is respected and valued in China. He pointed out that people who love their country must love their national culture. He concluded by saying that no matter what obstacles exist, cultural exchange between Japan and China will inevitably develop.

　　Those who went to the airport to welcome the "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe's return from China included: Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association; Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association; Korehito Kurahara, head of the Culture Department of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party; and renowned actor Koreya Senda, among other people from all walks of life, totaling three hundred.

　　When the "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe passed through Hong Kong on their way back to Japan, Kawarasaki Chojuro met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter and commented on Adenauer's recent visit to Japan. He said: "Past history has proven that the collusion between West Germany and Japanese militarism is not the wish of the Japanese people. Therefore, the Japanese people will not agree with Kishi Nobusuke and Adenauer's actions and express anger at their collusion. The Japanese people should adhere to a neutral path and maintain better friendship with the Soviet Union and China."

　　Kawarasaki Chojuro pointed out that the policies and measures of the Kishi Nobusuke government in Japan hinder the development of Japanese culture. "Therefore, the current task of people in the Japanese cultural circles is to strive for democracy and peace, and to fight for the independence of our motherland."

　　He also said: "We were deeply moved by the warm welcome and hospitality we received from the Chinese people during our performance tour in China. At the same time, we also saw the brilliant achievements of Chinese culture and art under the guidance of the correct policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new.'"

    日“前进座”剧团回到东京
    河原崎长十郎说日中文化交流必将得到发展
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本“前进座”剧团在中国访问演出两个月后已经在6日晚上回到东京。
      “前进座”剧团团长河原崎长十郎在羽田机场对欢迎群众发表谈话时说，他相信这次访问演出会加强日中两国人民之间的友好关系。
    他说，民族文化在中国受到尊重和重视。他指出，热爱自己国家的人一定热爱自己民族的文化。他最后说，无论存在着任何阻碍，日本同中国之间的文化交流一定会得到发展。
    到机场欢迎“前进座”剧团访华归来的有：日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏、日中贸易促进协会专务理事铃木一雄、日本共产党中央委员会文化部长藏原惟人和著名演员千田是也等各界人士三百人。
    在“前进座”剧团回国途中经过香港时，河原崎长十郎接见新华社记者就阿登纳最近访问日本的情况发表了谈话。他说：“过去的历史已经证明，西德和日本军国主义勾结在一起，并不是日本人民的愿望，因此日本人民是不会同意岸信介和阿登纳的做法的，并且对他们的勾结表示愤怒。日本人民应该坚持走中立的道路，与苏联和中国保持更好的友谊。”
    河原崎长十郎指出，日本岸信介政府的政策措施阻碍了日本文化的发展，“因此，日本文化界人士的当前任务是争取民主、和平，为我们祖国的独立而奋斗。”
    他又说：“我们这次到中国演出，受到了中国人民热烈的欢迎和盛情的招待，使我们很感动。同时，我们也看到了中国的文化艺术，在‘百花齐放，推陈出新’的正确方针指导下，已取得了辉煌的成就。”
