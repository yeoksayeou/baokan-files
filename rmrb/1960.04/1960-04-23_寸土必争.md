    Contend for Every Inch of Land
    Yang Yi
    There is a farmers' proverb in the northern countryside: "Cultivate a small patch, eat a steamed bun." This means that no matter how small a piece of land is planted, there will always be some harvest.
    Land is the most precious natural resource. Whether it is industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, or fisheries, none of these productions can do without it. With the great development of the entire socialist construction, the demand for land for industrial, transportation, water conservancy, forestry, animal husbandry, and other construction projects is increasing day by day. This increase in demand reflects the great development of the entire national economy, which is gratifying and reasonable. On the other hand, due to the high-speed development of the national economy, the requirements for agricultural production are also getting higher and higher. In our country, the way to achieve continuous leaps forward in agricultural production must be to further implement the policy of both multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield. On the one hand, we must earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural increase, and strive to improve the yield per unit area; at the same time, we must expand the cultivated area as much as possible, save land as much as possible, and increase the utilization rate of land, in order to achieve the goal of multiple planting for more yield.
    "Faster, even faster!" This is the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country for the high-speed development of socialist production. In order to be even faster, we should not arrange production and tap potential from one aspect or several aspects, but should try every means to mobilize the positive factors in all aspects and fully tap the potential in all aspects. The same is true for land use. We must both reclaim more wasteland to increase the cultivated area in general, and pay attention to saving land and increasing the utilization rate of existing cultivated land in many ways to actively expand the sown area. According to the latest statistics from Shanxi Province, by using various methods to save land, the three special districts of Jinbei, Jinzhong, and Jinnan have expanded the planting area by more than 5 million mu, which is equal to one-tenth of the national wasteland reclamation area last winter and this spring. Moreover, not only does the sparsely populated area have great potential, but also the Jinnan cotton and wheat producing area, located in the plains, has increased the sown area by 2 million mu in the land saving campaign. It can be seen that the potential in this area is very large, and almost no investment is required to achieve immediate results.
    In wartime, we often fight for every inch of land to annihilate a large number of enemies. Now, in the war against nature, we must fight for every inch of land even more, so that there is no abandoned material in the sky and no wasted land on the ground, and that every inch of land is fully utilized to yield more crops and serve socialist construction.

    寸土必争
    杨义
    北方农村有句农谚：“刨个窝窝，吃个馍馍”，这意思是说，不管种上多么小的一块地，总会有一定的收成。
    土地是最宝贵的自然资源。无论工业还是农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产，没有一项能离得开它。随着整个社会主义建设事业的大发展，工业、交通、水利、林业、畜牧以及其他各项建筑用地，需要量日益增加，这种需要量的增长，正反映了整个国民经济的大发展，是可喜的也是合理的。另一方面，由于国民经济高速度的发展，对于农业生产的要求也越来越高，在我国，实现农业生产连续跃进的途径，必须进一步贯彻多种多收与高产多收同时并举的方针，一方面要认真执行农业增产“八字宪法”，努力提高单位面积产量；同时更要尽可能的扩大耕地面积，尽量节约用地，提高土地的利用率，以达到多种多收的目的。
    “快些、更快些”，这是全国人民对于高速度发展社会主义生产的一致愿望。为了要更加快些，我们就不是从一个方面或几个方面来安排生产，挖掘潜力，而是要千方百计来调动各方面的积极因素，充分挖掘各方面的潜力。对于土地的利用也是这样。我们既要多开荒地，从总的方面来增加耕地面积；又要注意节约用地，多方面提高现有耕地的利用率，来积极扩大播种面积。据山西省最近统计，利用各种办法节约用地，晋北、晋中、晋南三个专区就扩大种植面积五百多万亩，即等于去冬今春全国开荒面积的十分之一。而且不仅地广人稀的地区潜力很大，就是地处平川的晋南棉麦产区，在节约用地运动中也增加播种面积二百万亩。可见得这方面的潜力是很大的，而且几乎不需要多少投资，就可以立竿见影。
    打仗的时候常常是寸土必争，大量歼灭敌人；如今，在对自然开战的时候，我们更要寸土必争，使天无弃物，地无废土，把每一寸土地充分利用起来，让每一寸土地献出更多的作物，为社会主义建设服务。
