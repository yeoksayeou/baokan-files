    Mississippi River Floods in the United States
    Disaster Area Spreads Across Ten Central States, Over Ten Thousand People Displaced
    (Reported by this newspaper) Due to the flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, ten states in the central United States—South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, and Minnesota—are experiencing their worst flood disaster in half a century.
    This particularly severe flood began on the evening of March 29th. A large amount of melting snow runoff and an all-night rainstorm caused the Mississippi River, the largest river in the United States, to flood. The floodwaters breached levees and inundated fields, towns, and highways. In western Illinois, the floodwaters cut a three-mile-long gap, inundating 15,000 acres of riverside farmland.
    Due to the swiftness of the floodwaters, in the hardest-hit disaster areas of Iowa and Nebraska, many people had to flee their homes empty-handed overnight in a panic. It is estimated that 15,000 people have now been displaced, and seven deaths have been confirmed. The disaster is showing a continuing trend of development.

    美国密士失必河泛滥成灾
    灾区遍中部十州　万余人流离失所
    本报讯　由于密士失必河及其支流的洪水上岸，美国中部的南达科他、内布拉斯加、衣阿华、堪萨斯、密苏里、伊利诺斯、威斯康星、密执安、北达科他和明尼苏达十个州，正遭受着当地半世纪以来最严重的一次洪灾。
    这次特大的水灾，开始于3月29日晚上。大量的融化的雪水的下泄，和一场彻夜的暴风雨，使得美国的最大河流密士失必河泛滥成灾。洪水冲破了堤防，淹没了田野、城镇、公路。在伊利诺斯的西部，洪水冲出一个三英里长的缺口，淹没了一万五千英亩的沿河田地。
    由于洪水来势凶猛，在首当其冲的依阿华、内布拉斯加两州的灾区中，许多人只得连夜仓惶地从家中空手出逃。据估计，现在已有一万五千人流离失所，已查明有七人丧生。灾情有继续发展的趋势。
