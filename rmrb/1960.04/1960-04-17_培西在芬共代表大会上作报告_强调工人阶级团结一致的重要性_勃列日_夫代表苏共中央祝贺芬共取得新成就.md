Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: According to a TASS report from Helsinki, Finnish Communist Party General Secretary Pesy delivered a report on April 15 at the 12th Congress of the Finnish Communist Party.

Pesy pointed out that the Finnish Communist Party Congress is being convened at a time when all mankind is experiencing tremendous changes, which can also be felt in Finland. He said that the characteristic of the current situation is the rapid and continuous growth of socialist forces, while the position of imperialism is being weakened day by day.

When discussing the issue of lasting peace for the working people of the world, Pesy expressed unease about the blatant militaristic and aggressive policies pursued by the Adenauer government. He advocated establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Northern Europe and turning the Baltic Sea into a sea of peace.

Pesy pointed out the growing peace demands of the Finnish people. He said that, except for those who follow the extreme right-wingers, almost all citizens support the friendly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. Pesy emphasized the great significance of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland and the basis for further developing such relations.

Pesy advocated developing Finland's trade with all parties, especially with socialist countries and former colonial countries.

The report particularly emphasized the importance of working-class unity, believing that this is the basic prerequisite for establishing a broad democratic front in the country. The report also pointed out the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance and elaborated on the party's tasks in rural areas.

Pesy finally talked about the party's organizational work and political and ideological work.

Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee. He pointed out that the Finnish Communist Party has gone through a long and glorious road and has become a mass party. He said that in the recent parliamentary elections in Finland, a quarter of the voters voted for the Communist Party and the People's Democratic League; the People's Democratic League faction has become the largest faction in the parliament. This fact shows the increasing support and trust of the Finnish working masses in the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic League.

Brezhnev talked about the achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in building a communist society. When talking about the international situation, he pointed out the importance of the Soviet Union's proposals on complete and thorough disarmament, the conclusion of peace treaties with the two Germanys, and the resolution of the West Berlin issue.

Brezhnev finally read out the congratulatory letter from the CPSU Central Committee to the Congress. The letter stated: When the Finnish Communist Party is convening its 12th Congress, it is a party that is united organizationally and ideologically and enjoys the trust and support of the broad masses of Finnish working people. The letter congratulated the Finnish Communist Party on its new achievements.

    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰共产党总书记培西15日在芬兰共产党第十二次代表大会上作了报告。
    培西指出，芬兰共产党代表大会是在这样的时期召开的：全人类经历着巨大的变化，这些变化在芬兰也可以感到。他说，目前形势的特点是：社会主义力量迅速不断地增长，而帝国主义的地位正在日益削弱。
    培西在谈到全世界劳动人民争取持久和平的问题时，对于阿登纳政府所奉行的明目张胆的军国主义的侵略政策表示不安。他主张在北欧建立无原子武器地区，主张把波罗的海变成和平的海洋。
    培西指出了芬兰人民和平要求的增长。他说，除了追随极右分子的人以外，几乎所有公民都支持芬兰和苏联之间的友好关系。培西着重指出了苏联和芬兰之间的友好关系的巨大意义和进一步发展这种关系的基础。
    培西主张发展芬兰同各方面的贸易，特别是同社会主义国家和前殖民地国家的贸易。
    报告特别强调工人阶级团结一致的重要性，认为这是在国内建立广泛的民主阵线的基本前提。报告中还指出工农联盟的重大意义，阐述了党在农村中的任务。
    培西最后谈到党的组织工作和政治思想工作问题。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、中央委员会书记勃列日?夫代表苏共中央在会上致贺词。他指出，芬兰共产党经过了漫长和光荣的道路，成了一个群众性的政党。他说，在芬兰最近的议会选举中，有四分之一的选民投共产党和人民民主联盟的票；人民民主联盟党团在议会中成了最大的党团。这一事实说明了芬兰劳动群众对共产党和人民民主联盟的政策的日益支持和对他们的信任。
    勃列日?夫谈到了苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下在建设共产主义社会中取得的成就。他在谈到国际局势时指出了苏联关于全面彻底裁军建议、同两个德国缔结和约以及解决西柏林问题的重要意义。
    勃列日?夫最后宣读了苏共中央给代表大会的贺信。信中说：芬兰共产党在召开第十二次代表大会的时候，是一个在组织上和思想上团结一致的政党，并享有芬兰广大劳动人民群众的信任和支持。这封信祝贺芬兰共产党取得新的成就。
