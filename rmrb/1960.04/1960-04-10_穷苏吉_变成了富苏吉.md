Speech by Representative Zha Xi Wang Xu
Presidium, fellow representatives:
I fully support the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee, and will resolutely implement them in practical work.

Now, I will give a speech on the development of the Sujitan People's Commune over the past two years. The Sujitan People's Commune is a pastoral commune composed of multiple ethnic groups. The commune has five ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Tu, with 417 households and 2,054 people. Among them, Tibetan and Mongolian members are the most numerous, followed by Han and Hui members, and only a few Tu households.

Before liberation, the people of Sujitan suffered profound disasters under the cruel rule of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs, the pastoralist class, and the feudal oppression and exploitation system of religious monasteries. Sujitan originally had more than 150 pastoralist households. In the years before liberation, more than 60 households were forced to flee to other places and wander around. By the time of liberation, only 89 households, 392 people, and more than 6,900 livestock were left, with an average of less than 18 livestock per person. Among the 89 pastoralist households, poor pastoralists accounted for more than 90%, 20% were destitute, and a dozen households did not even have dilapidated tents, sleeping in the grasslands, with inadequate clothing and food. At that time, Sujitan was called "Poor Suji."

After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the state, "Poor Suji" finally shed its label and stood up. Following the Party's General Line and the socialist road, the feudal oppression and exploitation system was eliminated, the productive forces were liberated, production was developed, and the economy was prosperous. Since the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, Sujitan has entered a new period of high-speed development. Members of all ethnic groups have further broken superstitions, liberated their minds, dared to think, dared to act, and their enthusiasm has been extremely high, and production is changing rapidly. Taking the original Sujitan People's Commune as an example (in 1959, the communes were merged, and the original Sujitan Commune was changed into a large team of the commune), the number of livestock in 1959 increased by 6.6 times compared with the time of liberation, and each person had an average of more than 80 livestock (only). Now, the entire commune has a total of 122,484 livestock of all sizes (only). The economic outlook of Sujitan has undergone profound changes.

1.  Strengthen leadership, make overall plans, and achieve an all-round leap forward in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry

Under the guidance of the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main task, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" proposed by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Sujitan People's Commune has strengthened leadership and comprehensively implemented the eight basic measures for developing animal husbandry production. With strong breeding as the key, it has strengthened the feeding and management of livestock, expanded the basic construction of grasslands, and vigorously carried out animal disease prevention and livestock crossbreeding and improvement. In 1959, 250,000 livestock (times) of various diseases were prevented and treated, and more than 10,000 livestock of various types were crossbred and improved. A large-scale "double full" (full fat, full pregnancy) and "five all" (all mating, all pregnant, all born, all alive, all strong) production competition was widely carried out, and hot-gestation mating was actively promoted, resulting in a continuous leap forward in animal husbandry production. In 1958, the net increase of livestock in the whole commune was 17%, and in 1959 it increased by another 20.2% compared with 1958. This year will be a year of even greater leap forward. The survival rate of young animals has reached 94%, and the top-grade fatness of livestock has always remained above 95%. The law of livestock "full in summer, fat in autumn, thin in winter, and death in spring" has been changed to "full in summer, fat in autumn, fat in winter, and strong in spring."

Vigorously developing agriculture and realizing the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry is a correct path to stabilize and rapidly develop animal husbandry and accelerate the construction of the commune. In the first year after the establishment of the Sujitan People's Commune, it achieved a bumper harvest with an average yield of 420 jin per mu, achieving self-sufficiency in grain and providing a large amount of forage and feed for livestock. This year, a new upsurge of all people reclaiming wasteland and greatly increasing grain production is booming. By the beginning of March, the whole commune had newly reclaimed more than 5,000 mu of land and sown more than 1,700 mu of grain crops. By the end of this year, the Sujitan People's Commune will have 20,000 mu of cultivated land, and it is expected that each person will have about 1,000 jin of grain.

Commune-run industry emerged after the establishment of the commune. Its development has had and is having a profound impact on changing the economic outlook and the people's spiritual outlook in pastoral areas and accelerating the construction of pastoral areas. Commune-run industry has established eight small factories, including agricultural and pastoral machinery repair and assembly, fertilizer, fur processing, flour feed processing, sewing, building materials, and biological drug manufacturing, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and serving agricultural and pastoral production and the lives of commune members. These factories are all developing soundly.

2.  The realization of settled grazing, the flourishing of cultural and health undertakings, and the vigorous development of the technical revolution

The realization of settled grazing is the ideal and urgent desire of the working herders for thousands of years, and it is also an important condition for promoting the development of various constructions and improving the material and cultural life of the people. When realizing settlement, the Sujitan People's Commune adopted the method of mass movement, mobilizing the masses to do it themselves. If they could repair houses, they would repair houses. If they could not repair houses, they would first implement settlement with tents and then gradually build houses, instead of waiting for the houses to be built before implementing settlement. Therefore, in the first year after the establishment of the commune, settled grazing was realized.

The health cause has developed greatly. Corresponding health and medical institutions have been established in communes, large teams, and small teams. Commune members can get medical treatment in time when they are sick. Pregnant women can get adequate rest and care. A new situation of healthy commune members and prosperous population has emerged. According to the statistics of 141 households in a pastoral team of the commune's No. 1 brigade, the average annual population growth rate since liberation has been as high as 3%.

With the continuous development of production, the vast number of commune members' requirements for learning culture and mastering advanced production technology are becoming more and more urgent. Actively carrying out cultural and technical revolution is an important link to ensure continuous leap forward in production. Before liberation, the working people had no right to study, and only a few people in the whole commune could roughly understand Tibetan. After liberation, especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, commune members have obtained the most convenient learning conditions. The commune has established primary and junior high schools, and all school-age children have been enrolled. Spare-time education has developed more rapidly. All commune members have actively participated in spare-time cultural learning, and illiteracy among adults was eliminated in 1958. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, the commune has established spare-time cultural schools and spare-time secondary schools for animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. 415 people participated in spare-time cultural school learning; 392 people participated in spare-time secondary schools for animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. At the beginning of mass school-running, the pastoralists satirized and said: "The sheep keeper also wants to be a veterinarian, that's unbelievable." However, the "sheep keeper" became a better veterinarian. Now, all students in the spare-time secondary school of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine have reached the requirements of "four personnel" (herdsmen, epidemic prevention personnel, breeding personnel, lambing personnel), and 180 people have reached the technical level of junior veterinarians. The number of veterinarians in the whole commune has developed from 16 before the establishment of the commune to 239. Veterinary hospitals have been established in the commune, clinics have been established in the large teams, and each group has epidemic prevention personnel and health kits. The goal of "minor illnesses not leaving the group and major illnesses not leaving the team" for livestock has been realized, promoting the development of production. The era of "seeking gods and chanting scriptures, losing both people and money" has passed forever.

3.  Rapid expansion of public accumulation and substantial increase in members' income

On the basis of production development, ensuring the continuous development and growth of the collectively owned economy is the material basis for expanding agricultural and pastoral basic construction, developing commune-run industries, and realizing the water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification of agricultural and pastoral production. After the establishment of the commune, with the great leap forward in production, public accumulation has also increased rapidly. In the cooperative, public accumulation could only reach about 5% of the total income each year, while in the first year after the establishment of the commune, public accumulation increased to more than 15%. The collective economy has achieved rapid development, increasing by 77.7% in 1959 compared to 1958. Now the collective economy has reached 29.37% of the total economic value of the whole commune.

At the same time, the income of commune members has also increased significantly. In 1959, the average income per person in the whole commune was more than 134 yuan, an increase of 17.64% compared to 1958, and the purchasing power of commune members also increased by 30% compared to 1958. The lives of commune members have been greatly improved, every household has savings, and the total amount of members' savings has reached 41,075 yuan. In terms of social welfare, commune members generally enjoy the grain supply system, the most reliable social insurance. According to the principle of active leadership and voluntary participation, all commune members have joined public canteens. Public canteens, due to strengthened leadership and adherence to democratic management, eat well, save money, and eat hygienically. It not only further liberated women, facilitated commune members, but also saved grain and promoted production.

4.  The consolidation and development of socialist ethnic relations, and ethnic unity entering a new stage

The great victory of the socialist revolution in 1958 completely eliminated feudal oppression and the system of class exploitation, and thus eliminated the social roots that endanger ethnic unity. The establishment of the People's Commune perfectly combined the basic interests of people of all ethnic groups into a unified whole. Thus, socialist ethnic relations characterized by great unity, great cooperation, equality, mutual assistance, and common development among all ethnic groups have been further developed. Within the People's Commune, through the joint production, mutual assistance, and mutual learning of members of all ethnic groups, the spiritual outlook of people of all ethnic groups has undergone profound changes, and the communist ideological consciousness has been greatly improved. Commune members are as close as a family regardless of ethnicity. This relationship reflects the spirit of our socialist era.

In order to better learn the thought of Chairman Mao and understand the Party's policies, members of all ethnic groups in the Sujitan People's Commune have actively and consciously launched a upsurge in learning Chinese and Mandarin. Illiteracy has been eliminated in the whole commune in Chinese, and both the elderly and children basically understand Mandarin. At the same time, members of all ethnic groups have also actively learned each other's ethnic languages. Many people can already speak general Chinese, Tibetan, and Mongolian. It is also very conducive to learning and mastering advanced production technologies and enhancing ethnic unity. In production, members of all ethnic groups teach and learn from each other. Han commune members enthusiastically help Mongolian and Tibetan commune members improve agricultural production technology, while Mongolian and Tibetan commune members earnestly teach Han and Hui commune members grazing experience. Facts have proved that the socialist road is the only correct road for all ethnic groups to achieve common prosperity and development. Only by completely eliminating the exploiting classes can the ethnic issue be fundamentally resolved, and unbreakable close unity can be achieved among ethnic groups. The People's Commune is also the best organizational form for developing the economy and culture of all ethnic groups in our country and strengthening ethnic unity.

The fundamental reasons why Sujitan has rapidly moved from poverty and backwardness to prosperity and development lie in the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and the mass line. Every step the people of Sujitan have taken in the past ten years has been forward under the leadership of the Party. The people of Sujitan say it well: "The poor have great aspirations, unity is strength, with the leadership of the Party, we are not afraid of heaven, earth, gods, and ghosts." The Party and Chairman Mao enjoy supreme prestige among the people of all ethnic groups, and the people naturally link their destiny closely with the Party. In the past few years, commune cadres have strictly implemented the Party's mass line working methods, eating, living, and working with the masses, greatly strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, improving the cadres' leadership level, and inspiring the masses' enthusiasm. In all work, we have adhered to putting politics in command and continuously strengthened socialist and communist ideological education for commune members. Therefore, the masses have high consciousness, great enthusiasm, and love the collective and the People's Commune more than their own lives. Female Communist Party member Tan Zhuoma, when the commune moved in 1958, saw that 30 of the commune's sheep had fallen into the rapid Haomen River. For the sake of the commune's public property, she selflessly went into the water to rescue them. After rescuing 27 sheep, this heroic Communist Party member unfortunately sacrificed herself. However, her heroic deeds will always live in the hearts of the people and become a model for inspiring all commune members to leap forward. From their personal experience, the people of Sujitan firmly believe that with the leadership of the Party and the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, no force can stop their progress, and they will be able to move towards the great goal of communism at a faster speed.

    “穷苏吉”变成了富苏吉
    苏吉滩人民公社，1958年牲畜净增17％，1959年又比1958年净增20.2％；建社的第一年，粮食平均单产就达到四百二十斤；目前，公社、大队、小队都建立了卫生医疗机构；1959年全社平均每人收入一百三十四元多，比1958年又增加17.64％。
    札喜旺徐代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念、谭震林副总理向大会所作的报告和常务委员会的工作报告，并在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我就苏吉滩人民公社两年来的发展情况作一发言。苏吉滩人民公社是多民族联合组成的牧业公社。全社有藏、蒙、汉、回、土等五个民族，四百一十七户，二千零五十四人，其中以藏族和蒙古族社员最多，汉族和回族社员次之，土族只有几户。
    解放前，苏吉滩人民在蒋马匪帮、牧主阶级和宗教寺院的封建压迫剥削制度的残酷统治下，遭受了深重的灾难。苏吉滩原有一百五十多户牧民，在解放前的年代里，有六十多户被迫逃亡他乡，四处飘泊。到解放时，只留下了八十九户，三百九十二人，六千九百多头牲畜，每人平均占有牲畜还不到十八只。在八十九户牧民中，贫苦牧民达90％以上，有20％是赤贫户，有十几户连破旧的帐篷也没有，露宿草滩，衣不蔽体，食不果腹。那时候，苏吉滩被叫做“穷苏吉”。
    解放后，在党的英明领导和国家的大力扶植下，“穷苏吉”才摘了帽子，翻了身。遵循着党的总路线，沿着社会主义道路，消灭了封建压迫剥削制度，解放了生产力；发展了生产，繁荣了经济。1958年人民公社成立以后，苏吉滩进入了一个高速度发展的新时期。各族社员进一步破除迷信，解放思想，敢想，敢干，干劲极为高昂，生产日新月异。以原苏吉滩人民公社（1959年进行了并社，原苏吉滩公社改为该社的一个大队）来看，1959年牲畜较解放时增加了六点六倍，每人平均已有牲畜八十多头（只）。现在，全社共有大小牲畜十二万二千四百八十四头（只）。苏吉滩的经济面貌已经发生了深刻的变化。
    一、加强领导，全面规划，工农牧业生产全面跃进
    苏吉滩人民公社在中共青海省委提出的“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针指导下，加强领导，全面地贯彻执行了发展畜牧业生产的八项基本措施，以壮为纲，加强了对牲畜的饲养管理，扩大了草原基本建设；大力进行了兽疫防治和牲畜杂交改良。1959年防治各种牲畜疫病二十五万头（次），杂交改良各类牧畜一万余只，广泛开展了牲畜“双满”（满膘、满胎）、“五全”（全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮）的丰产竞赛，积极推行了热胎配种，获得了畜牧业生产连续大跃进。全社1958年牲畜净增17％，1959年又比1958年净增20.2％。今年将是更大跃进的一年，幼畜成活率达94％，牲畜头等膘一直保持在95％以上。一变历来牲畜“夏满、秋肥、冬瘦、春死亡”的规律，而为“夏满、秋肥、冬胖、春健壮”。
    大力发展农业，实现农牧结合，是稳定、高速度发展畜牧业，加速公社建设的一条正确道路。苏吉滩人民公社建立后的第一年，就获得了粮食亩产平均四百二十斤的大丰收，实现了粮食自给，并且为牲畜提供了大量的饲草、饲料。今年，一个全民开荒、大量增产粮食的新高潮正在蓬勃发展。到3月初全社已新开荒地五千多亩，播种粮食作物一千七百多亩。到今年年底，苏吉滩人民公社将拥有耕地二万亩，预计每人将会有粮食千斤左右。
    社办工业是公社成立后兴起的。它的发展对于改变牧业区经济面貌和人民的精神面貌，加速牧区建设已经并且正在发生着深远的影响。社办工业本着因地制宜，就地取材的原则，和为农牧业生产服务，为社员生活服务的方针，建立了农牧机具修配、化肥、皮毛加工、面粉饲料加工、缝纫、建筑材料和生物药品制造等八个小型工厂。这些工厂都正在健全地发展着。
    二、实现了定居放牧，文化卫生事业欣欣向荣，技术革命蓬勃发展
    实现定居放牧是劳动牧民千百年的理想和迫切愿望，也是促进各项建设发展和改善人民物质文化生活的重要条件。苏吉滩人民公社在实现定居时，采取了群众运动的办法，发动群众自己动手，能修房屋修房屋，不能修房屋就先以帐篷实行定居，再逐步建立房屋，而不是等待房屋建立以后，再去实行定居。所以，建社后的第一年，就实现了定居放牧。
    卫生事业有很大发展。公社、大队、小队都建立了相应的卫生医疗机构。社员有病可以及时得到医疗。孕妇可以获得充分的休息和关照。出现了社员体质健康、人口兴旺的新景象。根据该社一大队牧业队一百四十一户的统计，解放后每年人口平均增长高达3％。
    随着生产的不断发展，广大社员对于学习文化掌握先进生产技术的要求也愈来愈迫切。积极地开展文化技术革命，是保证生产连续跃进的重要环节。解放前，劳动人民没有学习的权利，全社只有几个人粗识藏文。解放后特别是人民公社建立后，社员得到了最便利的学习条件。公社建立了小学和初中，学龄儿童已经全部入学。业余教育更迅速发展，全体社员积极地参加了业余文化学习，1958年扫除了壮年中的文盲。在扫除文盲的基础上，公社建立了业余文化学校和畜牧兽医业余中学。有四百一十五人参加了业余文化学校学习；有三百九十二人参加了畜牧兽医业余中学。群众办学之初，牧主讽刺说：“羊把式还想当兽医，活见鬼”。但是，“羊把式”当了更好的兽医。现在，畜牧兽医业余中学的全部学员都达到了“四员”（放牧员、防疫员、配种员、接羔员）的要求，并且有一百八十人达到了初级兽医的技术水平。全社兽医已经由公社建立前的十六人，发展到二百三十九人。在公社建立了兽医院，大队建立了诊疗所，群群都有防疫员、保健箱。实现了牲畜“小病不出群、大病不出队”，促进了生产的发展。“求神念经，人财两空”的时代，已经永远过去了。
    三、公共积累迅速扩大，社员收入大大增加
    在生产发展的基础上，保证社有经济的不断发展和壮大，是扩大农牧业基本建设，发展社办工业，实现农牧业生产水利化、机械化、电气化的物质基础。公社建立以后，随着生产的大跃进，公共积累也有了迅速的增长。在合作社时，公共积累每年只能达到总收入的5％左右，而在公社成立后的第一年，公共积累就增长到15％以上。社有经济获得了迅速发展，1959年比1958年增长77.7％。现在社有经济已经达到全社经济总值的29.37％。
    同时，社员收入也有了显著的提高。1959年全社每人平均收入一百三十四元多，比1958年又增加了17.64％，社员购买力也比1958年提高了30％。社员生活大大提高，户户都有存款，社员存款总额达四万一千零七十五元。社会福利事业方面，社员普遍享受了粮食供给制这个最可靠的社会保险。根据积极领导，自愿参加的方针，全部社员都参加了公共食堂。公共食堂由于加强了领导、坚持了民主管理，吃的饱、吃的省、吃的卫生。既进一步解放了妇女，方便了社员，又节约了粮食，促进了生产。
    四、巩固地发展了社会主义的民族关系，民族团结进入了一个新阶段
    1958年社会主义革命的伟大胜利，彻底消灭了封建压迫，消灭了阶级剥削制度，也就消灭了危害民族团结的社会根源。人民公社的建立，把各民族人民的基本利益，完善地结合成为统一的整体。从而，以各民族大团结、大协作、平等互助、共同发展为特点的社会主义民族关系获得了进一步发展。在人民公社内，通过各族社员共同生产，互相帮助，互相学习，各民族人民的精神面貌上已发生了深刻的变化，共产主义思想觉悟大大提高了。社员们不分民族都是亲如一家。这种关系正是反映着我们社会主义时代的精神。
    为了更好的学习毛主席思想，领会党的政策，苏吉滩人民公社各族社员积极地、自觉地开展了学习汉文、汉语的热潮。全社已经用汉文扫除了文盲，不论老人、小孩都基本上懂得了汉语。同时，各族社员也积极地学习相互间的民族语言。许多人已经能说一般的汉、藏、蒙三种语言。也大为有利于学习和掌握先进生产技术，增强民族团结。在生产上，各族社员互教互学。汉族社员热心帮助蒙、藏族社员提高农业生产技术，蒙、藏族社员则认真地教汉族和回族社员以放牧经验。事实证明，社会主义道路是各民族实现共同繁荣发展的唯一正确的道路，只有彻底消灭剥削阶级，民族问题才能获得根本解决，民族之间才能实现牢不可破的亲密团结。人民公社对于发展我国各民族经济、文化和加强民族团结来说也是一个最好的组织形式。
    苏吉滩从贫困落后迅速地走上繁荣发展，根本原因在于党的领导，政治挂帅和群众路线。十年来，苏吉滩人民走的每一步，无一不是在党的领导下前进的。苏吉滩人民说的好：人穷志气大，团结力量强，有了党领导，天地神鬼都不怕。党和毛主席在各族人民中享有至高无上的威望，人民很自然地把自己的命运紧紧同党联结在一起。几年来，公社干部严格地贯彻执行了党的群众路线的工作方法，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，大大密切了干部与群众的关系，提高了干部领导水平，鼓舞了群众干劲。在一切工作上都坚持了政治挂帅，不断地加强对社员进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，所以，群众觉悟高，干劲大，热爱集体，热爱人民公社胜于自己的生命。女共产党员谈卓麻，在1958年公社迁移时，见到有公社的三十只羊掉进水流湍急的浩门河里，为了社的公共财产，她奋不顾身地下水抢救，在救出二十七只羊以后，这位英雄的共产党员却不幸牺牲了。但是，她的英雄事迹永远活在人民的心里，成为鼓舞全体社员跃进的榜样。苏吉滩人民从切身的体验中，坚信有党的领导，有总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，就没有任何力量能够阻挡他们的前进，就一定能够以更快的速度奔向伟大的目标——共产主义。
