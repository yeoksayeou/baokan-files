Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th - U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan issued a joint statement on the 29th, after two days of talks, presenting a mutually agreed upon counter-proposal to the recent new Soviet proposals regarding the cessation of nuclear testing.

Macmillan traveled to the United States on the 26th specifically to discuss with the U.S. government how to address the Soviet proposals.

The joint statement, on the one hand, expressed that the U.S. and British governments "earnestly hope" to conclude a comprehensive agreement banning nuclear weapons testing, but at the same time, it emphasized that in order to conclude a treaty banning nuclear testing as soon as possible, a series of issues must be resolved. The statement listed the following as these issues: the issue of conducting an equal number of on-site investigations, the composition of the supervisory commission and the personnel of the supervisory posts, the procedures for voting in the supervisory body, and the issue of "explosions" conducted "for peaceful purposes."

That is to say, the U.S. and British governments still insist on resolving the issues of supervision and inspection as a prerequisite for agreeing to cease nuclear testing.

The joint statement said that the two countries believe that only after a treaty banning nuclear testing is concluded and arrangements are made for jointly studying methods of monitoring nuclear tests with seismic magnitudes below 4.75, will they be willing to "automatically suspend nuclear weapons tests below that limit for a mutually agreed upon period."

The statement said that this limited-term extension of explosions should be achieved through individual declarations issued by each of the three countries, the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union.

The statement did not specify how long the mentioned period for ceasing small-scale underground nuclear explosions would be, but according to U.S. State Department spokesman Burding, the period would be "significantly shorter than the four to five years proposed by the Russians in Geneva." The official U.S. news agency, the United States Information Service, said that the period would be one year or less. Anderson, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both houses of the U.S. Congress, recently pointed out that a one-year suspension of small-scale underground nuclear testing would not seriously affect the U.S.'s nuclear armament plan.

As for the statement mentioned in the joint statement that the three countries would individually issue declarations to suspend small-scale underground nuclear explosions, according to U.S. news agencies, this is because U.S. President Eisenhower's term will expire in January next year, and a unilateral declaration would not be legally binding on the next U.S. president. According to Western news agencies, Eisenhower and Macmillan, after concluding their talks on ceasing nuclear testing, also discussed issues such as the East-West summit.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 31st - U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on the 30th, answering questions regarding the U.S. government's attitude towards ceasing nuclear testing and other issues.

Eisenhower had to acknowledge the Soviet Union's sincerity regarding disarmament and the cessation of nuclear testing. He said that the Soviets do want "a certain degree" of disarmament, and the new proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of ceasing nuclear testing indicate that the Soviet Union "wants further negotiations."

At the same time, Eisenhower repeated the U.S. government's old tune, saying that the "heart of the matter" of disarmament "is mutual inspection and verification."

He also indicated that even if a treaty on extending nuclear testing is signed according to the proposals announced by the U.S. and Britain on the 29th, the new U.S. president can still freely reconsider whether to suspend this pause after his presidential term expires in January next year. He said that "any successor of his will have the right to make his own judgment on this issue."

### 艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦发表联合声明  用老调子回答苏联新建议  坚持以监督和视察作为停止核试验前提

    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦发表联合声明
    用老调子回答苏联新建议
    坚持以监督和视察作为停止核试验前提
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦举行了两天会谈后，在29日发表联合声明，对苏联最近提出的关于停止核试验问题的新建议提出了一致协议的反建议。
    麦克米伦是在26日前往美国，专门同美国政府讨论如何对付苏联的建议的。
    联合声明一方面表示美国和英国政府是“热切希望”缔结一项禁止核武器试验的广泛协议的，但同时它强调说，为了尽快缔结禁止核试验的条约，就必须解决一系列的问题。在声明中列为这些问题的有：在现场进行同等数量的调查问题，监督委员会的组成和监督岗的人员问题，在监督机构中进行表决的程序问题，以及“为和平目的”而进行“爆炸”的问题。
    这就是说，美英两国政府仍然坚持以先解决监督和视察问题作为同意停止核试验的前提。
    联合声明说，两国认为，只有在缔结了禁止核试验的条约，并且就共同研究地震幅度在四点七五以下的核试验的监督办法作出安排以后，它们才愿意“在一致同意的期限内自动暂停那个限度以下的核武器试验”。
    声明说，这种一定期限的延期爆炸要由美、英、苏三国中的每一个国家单独发表声明来实现。
    声明没有说明它提到的关于停止小型地下核爆炸的期限是多长，但是据美国国务院发言人伯丁说，这个期限将要“大大短于俄国人在日内瓦所提的四年到五年”。美国官方通讯社美国新闻处说，这个期限将是一年或者不到一年。美国国会两院原子能联合委员会主席安德逊不久前曾经指出，如果暂停小型地下核试验一年，将不会给美国的核扩军计划带来严重影响。
    至于联合声明中提到的由三国单独发表声明暂停小型地下核爆炸的说法，据美国通讯社透露，这是因为美国总统艾森豪威尔明年1月间将任期届满，一个单方面的声明可以不对美国下届总统有法律的约束力。据西方通讯社报道，艾森豪威尔同麦克米伦在结束了关于停止核试验的会谈后，又讨论了有关东西方最高级会议等问题。
    据新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔30日举行记者招待会，回答了有关美国政府对停止核试验的态度等问题。
    艾森豪威尔不得不承认苏联对裁军和停止核试验的诚意。他说，苏联人确实希望“有一定程度的”裁军，苏联在最近提出的关于停止核试验问题的新建议表明苏联“希望进一步谈判”。
    同时，艾森豪威尔重弹美国政府的老调，说裁军“问题的中心是相互视察和查核”。
    他还表明，即使按照美国和英国29日宣布的主张签订了关于延期核试验的条约，在他的总统任期明年1月届满以后，新的美国总统仍然可以不受约束地重新考虑是否中止这种暂停。他说，他的“任何继任者都将有权对这个问题作出自己的判断”。
