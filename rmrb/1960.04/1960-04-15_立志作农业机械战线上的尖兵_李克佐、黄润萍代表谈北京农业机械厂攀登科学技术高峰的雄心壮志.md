    Aspiring to be Pioneers on the Agricultural Machinery Front
    Representatives Li Kezuo and Huang Runping Discuss the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory's Ambitious Goal of Scaling Scientific and Technological Heights

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the peasant brothers have raised three questions for our factory:
    First, the combine harvesters produced in the past were designed according to a yield of four to five hundred catties per mu, which is not suitable for the high-yield wheat in many areas;
    Second, the originally produced combine harvesters consumed a lot of steel, had high costs, and could only harvest wheat and soybeans. They could not be comprehensively utilized, and could only be used for twenty-odd days a year, which was uneconomical;
    Third, the production quantity could not keep up with the needs of development.
    Now, solutions have been found for the first two problems. Regarding the third problem, we are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and actively seeking ways to increase production.
    Fellow representatives:
    We fully agree with and enthusiastically support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. These three reports use Mao Zedong Thought to provide a brilliant theoretical exposition of China's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Without a doubt, it will generate tremendous power in China's socialist construction. We must go back and convey and implement it properly. After seeing and hearing these three reports, and hearing Vice Premier Li Fuchun mention in his report that the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory is one of the major national construction projects, all the employees of our factory were greatly encouraged; they are determined to support agricultural technology transformation with more outstanding production results and work achievements, and ensure the early completion of this glorious task assigned to us by the state.

    The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory was established just two months after the liberation of Beijing. It has been exactly eleven years now. This factory can be said to have developed completely along with the progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture. Over the past eleven years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, we have done some work in agricultural mechanization. During the period of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, we provided agriculture with various walking plows, cultivators, chaff cutters, rice threshers, etc.; during the period of elementary cooperatives, we provided double-wheeled double-furrow plows, rocker-arm harvesters, etc.; since the advanced cooperatives and up to now, we have provided tractor-drawn grain combine harvesters, swathers, artificial rain machines, universal chassis tractors, etc. These works have played a certain role in promoting agricultural production and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. The factory's current production capacity is equivalent to 164 times that of ten years ago, and 5.4 times that of the year before the Great Leap Forward (1957). However, our work is still far from meeting the requirements and needs of agricultural production. Vice Premier Li instructed us in his report: "Under the conditions that the rural areas have realized people's communes, we should advance the worker-peasant alliance to a new stage, so that industry actively supports agriculture and agriculture is gradually built on a modern foundation." This instruction is very correct and very timely, and we warmly respond to this call.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, what major demands have the peasant brothers raised to our factory? First, the combine harvesters produced in the past were designed according to a yield of four to five hundred catties per mu, which is not suitable for the high-yield wheat in many areas; second, the original combine harvesters consumed a lot of steel, had high costs, and could only harvest wheat and soybeans. They could not be comprehensively utilized and could only be used for twenty-odd days a year, which was uneconomical; third, the production capacity and supply quantity were far from meeting the actual needs. In order to solve these problems, our factory, in cooperation with relevant departments, trial-produced three types of combine harvesters in 1958, and also tested the latest combine harvesters produced by Britain at that time, but none of them were successful in harvesting high-yield wheat. In 1959, we trial-produced two more types, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the problem of harvesting high-yield wheat was solved. However, the problem of comprehensive utilization has not yet been solved. Over the past year, especially since the vigorous development of the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, we have cooperated with Tsinghua University, and this problem has also been basically solved recently. This is the Friendship brand universal chassis automatic combine harvester that will soon be put into production. According to the results of last year's and this year's tests, it can harvest wheat with a yield of about 1,100 catties per mu. It does not need to be pulled by a tractor. One person can operate it and harvest about 170,000 catties of wheat per day. After the harvest season, it can be converted into an agricultural truck for transportation or fixed operations such as irrigation and drainage, and threshing. We are also currently cooperating with Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute, Jilin University of Technology, etc., to further improve the design so that it can harvest soybeans, rice, etc., and can also cultivate land and sow seeds. Such a combine harvester that can harvest high-yield wheat of thousands of catties per mu and can be comprehensively utilized is a product of China's Great Leap Forward and technical revolution and technical innovation movement; no capitalist country has it yet.

    In wheat-producing areas, wheat harvesting is the busiest and most tiring season of the year, and it is the peak of the year's labor. At this time, it is necessary to rush to harvest, rush to plant, and also carry out inter-tillage weeding of spring-sown crops or pruning and topping of cotton. Farmers describe wheat harvesting as "seizing food from the dragon's mouth." Therefore, the broad masses of farmers demand that this problem must not only be solved but also be realized through mechanization in advance. Otherwise, the arrangement of labor throughout the year will be very difficult. However, according to the state's expansion plan for our factory, it will not be completed and accepted until the spring of 1962 before it can be fully put into production. In order to meet the urgent needs of the peasant brothers, the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery instructed our factory to supply new products in advance. Moreover, it pointed out to our factory that on the one hand, we must vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, on the other hand, we must vigorously carry out the "three sides" (that is, side-by-side trial production, side-by-side construction, and side-by-side production preparation); and third, we must vigorously carry out cooperation. We are implementing these instructions and have achieved some results. According to the recent results, in terms of the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, we have realized that: First, the technical revolution and technical innovation have greatly changed the appearance of production and greatly improved production capacity. In the past two months, all employees of the factory have gone to work to engage in production, and have engaged in innovation after work. They have not rested on Sundays and have launched all-night assault battles. Four battles have been carried out in two months, and 95% of the employees have participated in the movement, achieving remarkable results. Now, advanced tools and drills (Ni Zhifu and Li Fuxiang drills) are widely used in the factory, increasing the cutting speed from 30 to 40 meters per minute in the past to 130 to 160 meters, and the utilization rate of metal cutting machine tools has also increased from 70% to 90%. Many single-machine automatic machine tools and mechanized and automated production lines have emerged, and the appearance of production is changing with each passing day, and production capacity is increasing step by step. The daily output value in January increased by 18% compared with December last year, and February increased by 37.3% compared with January. The quarterly plan was overfulfilled, and the output value increased by 39% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. This makes it possible to complete the annual plan for old products ahead of schedule, and gradually transfer workers for training, creating good conditions for the early launch of new products and expansion into production. Second, technical revolution and technical innovation have gradually eliminated heavy physical labor, and manual operation has gradually realized mechanization (our factory plans to basically realize it before May 1st) and automation, thus making labor more and more a pleasant thing, thereby greatly stimulating the creativity and enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees. For example, our factory uses a lot of shaped steel, which used to require nineteen people to straighten with a manual sledgehammer, which was both tiring and deafening. Workers, technicians, and leading cadres combined, and learned from the experience of fraternal factories, and made a straightening machine in a few days, which only required one person. It was neither tiring nor noisy. There are many such examples. "Existence determines consciousness." The appearance of production and technology is changing, and the mental outlook of people is also changing. Workers have not only improved their skills, but have even become poets. They use poetry to praise this movement. For example, the worker who just mentioned the example wrote like this: "In the past, straightening with a sledgehammer, now changing to machine adjustment, the appearance of production has changed and people are smiling, all because of the Party's good leadership." The relationship between technicians and skilled workers is also becoming closer and closer. Technicians said: The things that come out of the "three combinations" are good, fast, economical and easy to use. Like that straightening machine, according to the old method, relying solely on technicians would take a month just for design drawings. In particular, many inventions and creations have recently appeared, breaking the methods and theories in books, and producing many products that did not exist in the past. It has used facts to break many superstitions in science and technology and has eliminated the inferiority complex of "valuing the outside over the inside." It has greatly strengthened the confidence that it will be able to climb the peak of world science and technology in the near future. At the same time, "when drinking water, think of the source." All these achievements have been achieved under the leadership of the Party and by vigorously carrying out the mass movement. Therefore, the problem of the Party's leadership and the mass line in technical work has also been more deeply understood and recognized by many technicians. In this way, all employees of the factory are as enthusiastic about the technical innovation and technical revolution movement as eating sugar cane, eating from head to root, and the more they eat, the sweeter it becomes. The employees of our factory have proposed that this year, all six new workshops will be adjusted, ten mechanized and automated sections will be built, fifty mechanized and automated production lines will be built, one thousand single-machine automatic and special machine tools will be built, three thousand sets of process equipment will be built, and fifty-seven new technologies (seventeen of which are at the world level) will be mastered. Third, the results of technical revolution and technical innovation in the factory and in various places are quickly applied to capital construction, which can save a lot of equipment and process equipment, reduce a lot of technicians and apprentices who need to be trained, and thus can greatly shorten the production preparation cycle. For example, the new stamping workshop of our factory was originally designed to avoid electric welding flash, and seven small houses needed to be built in the factory building, and the light was also very bad. The equipment installation was also very crowded. Now, we have used the results of the technical revolution of the Luoyang Tractor Factory and adopted automatic welding. Less equipment can be installed, and the small houses no longer need to be built. The problem has been solved very satisfactorily. The construction speed has been greatly accelerated. Fourth, combine indigenous and foreign methods, use foreign methods whenever possible, and use indigenous methods when foreign methods are not possible. According to the process design of our factory and the current order situation, the special equipment alone will not be fully supplied by the end of next year. This means that we have to use indigenous methods in many aspects. And because of the results of the technical revolution and technical innovation, many indigenous methods are even better than foreign methods. This allows us to vigorously carry out the "three sides." For example, in the new engine workshop, the walls at both ends have not yet been built, and more than 100 machine tools have already been installed in March, and 120 machine tools have been test-run and put into production on April 1st. Regarding cooperation, we have also had many experiences recently. In terms of the technical force of our factory, the strength of the technical personnel is only one-third of the work needs this year. But on the one hand, due to the "three combinations" within the factory, a large number of skilled workers have been mobilized, and on the other hand, due to the "three combinations" outside the factory, we have obtained the support of more than 200 people from many units such as Tsinghua University, Shandong Institute of Technology, Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute, Jilin University of Technology, Luoyang Institute of Technology, Dalian Machine Tool Design Institute, and Process Research Institute. Therefore, it is expected that not only can this year's technical work be completed, but also a lot of cutting-edge products and technologies can be developed. In addition, our factory has also established an Agricultural Machinery Institute, which can also provide some help. In addition, our factory has recently tentatively agreed with Kaifeng Machinery Factory that in the first half of next year, our factory will first produce the engine and chassis of the combine harvester, and the Kaifeng factory will produce the cutting, threshing and straw collection parts, and assemble them into finished products. This can also greatly shorten the production preparation cycle. By the way, we have learned that in addition to the central government still needing to retain a small number of factories that produce complete sets of combine harvesters when necessary, if the central factory supplies engines and chassis, and the cutting, threshing, and other parts that are relatively easy to manufacture are subsequently manufactured and assembled by local organizations, this will be able to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization and save a lot of transportation power in a manner tailored to local conditions.

    Fellow representatives, China's current situation is just as Vice Premier Li Xiannian said: "The economy is prosperous, financial resources are abundant, prices are stable, and inventories are increasing." It is truly a spring scene with a good outlook. It is also as Mao Zedong wrote in his poem "Qinyuanchun": "Our land so rich in beauty, compels countless heroes to bow in admiration." Under the wise leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the people of the whole country have become heroes and heroines. Under this great situation, although the employees of our Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory are facing difficulties such as insufficient technical force, insufficient equipment, insufficient materials, and especially insufficient construction force, we are determined to exert all our energy and strive for progress, and under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery and the Beijing Municipal Committee, and with the support of fraternal factories and the broad masses of peasant brothers, we guarantee to complete this year's old product task one quarter in advance, supply the new products that can only be supplied after expansion one year in advance, and vow to successfully complete the expansion task assigned by the state ahead of schedule.

    立志作农业机械战线上的尖兵
    李克佐、黄润萍代表谈北京农业机械厂攀登科学技术高峰的雄心壮志
    大跃进以来，农民兄弟向我厂提出了三个问题：
    第一、过去生产的联合收割机是按照每亩四、五百斤的产量设计的，它对很多地区的高产小麦就不能适应了；
    第二、原来生产的联合收割机，只能收获麦子和大豆，不能综合利用，一年只能利用二十几天，不经济；
    第三、生产的数量赶不上需要的发展。
    现在，前一、二两个问题已经找到了解决的办法。关于第三个问题，我们正在大闹技术革新，积极设法提高产量。各位代表：
    我们完全同意并热烈拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。这三个报告用毛泽东思想对我国社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社，从理论上作了精辟的论证。毫无疑问，它将在我国社会主义建设中发生巨大的力量。我们一定要回去好好地传达贯彻。我厂全体职工看到和听到这三个报告后，并且听到李富春副总理在报告中提到：北京农业机械厂是国家建设的主要项目之一，无不欢欣鼓舞；决心以更出色的生产成绩和工作成绩来支援农业技术改造，保证提前完成国家交给我们的这一光荣任务。
    北京农业机械厂是在北京解放后两个月就建立的。到现在整整十一年了。这个厂可以说是完全随着农业的社会主义改造的进展而发展起来的。十一年来，在党和政府的正确领导下，对农业机械化作了一些工作，在互助组及个体农户时期，为农业提供了各种步犁、耘锄、铡草机、打稻机等；在初级合作社时期，提供了双轮双铧犁、摇臂收割机等；从高级社以后到现在，又提供了机引谷物联合收割机、割晒机、人工降雨机、万能底盘拖拉机等。这些工作对于促进农业生产、加强工农联盟，起了一定的作用。这个厂现在的生产能力相当于十年前的一百六十四倍，相当于大跃进前一年（1957年）的五点四倍。但是我们的工作还远远不能满足农业生产的要求和需要。李副总理在报告中指示我们：“在农村已经实现了人民公社化的条件下，我们应当把工农联盟推进到一个新的阶段，使工业积极支援农业，使农业逐步地建立在现代化的基础上。”这一指示非常正确，非常及时，我们热烈响应这个号召。
    大跃进以来，农民弟兄主要给我们厂提出了哪些要求呢？第一、过去生产的联合收割机是按每亩四、五百斤的产量设计的，它对很多地区的高产小麦就不能适应了；第二、原生产的联合收割机消耗钢铁多，成本高，只能作收获麦子、大豆等工作，不能综合利用、干其他农活，因此一年只能利用二十几天，不经济；第三、生产能力和供应数量距离实际需要相差很远。为了解决这些问题，我厂与有关部门协作，于1958年试制了三种联合收割机，并且也用当时英国最新出产的联合收割机作了试验，但对收获高产小麦，都没有成功。1959年又试制了两种，同时在苏联的无私援助下，高产小麦的收获问题解决了。但是还没有解决综合利用的问题。一年来，特别是大搞技术革命和技术革新运动以来，又与清华大学协作，这个问题最近也基本解决了。这就是即将投入生产的友谊牌通用底盘式自动联合收割机。根据去年和今年试验的结果，它能收获亩产一千一百斤左右的小麦。它不需拖拉机拉，一人操作，每天即可收获小麦十七万斤左右。收获季节过后，可以把它改装成农用卡车，作运输或排灌、脱谷等固定作业。现在还正在和清华大学、北京农业机械化学院、吉林工业大学等协作，进一步改进设计，使它能收大豆、水稻等，并能耕地、播种。像这种既能收获亩产千斤小麦、又能综合利用的联合收割机，是我国大跃进和技术革命和技术革新运动的产物；现在任何资本主义国家还没有。
    在麦产区，麦收是一年中农活最忙最累的季节，是一年中劳动量的高峰。这时候既抢收、又抢种、还要进行春播作物的中耕锄草或棉花的整枝打杈。农民形容麦收叫“龙口夺食”。因此，广大农民要求这一问题不但必须解决，而且要提前实现机械化。否则，全年劳动力的安排就很困难。可是按照国家对我厂的扩建计划，要到1962年春才交工验收，全面投入生产。为了满足农民兄弟们的迫切要求，中央农业机械部指示我厂要提前供应新产品。并且，给我厂指出一方面要大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，一方面要大搞“三边”（即边试验生产，边建设，边作生产准备）；第三方面要大搞协作。我们正在贯彻这些指示，并已取得一些效果。根据最近进行的结果，在技术革命和技术革新运动方面，我们体会到：第一、技术革命和技术革新使生产面貌大为改观，生产能力大为提高。最近两个月来，全厂职工上班搞生产，下班搞革新，星期天不休息，彻夜突击战，两个月搞了四个战役，95％的职工都参加了运动，收到显著的效果。现在全厂普遍使用了先进的刀具和钻头（倪志福和李福祥钻头）提高了切削速度，由过去每分钟三十至四十米，提高到了一百三十至一百六十米，金属切削机床的利用率也由70％提高到90％。出现了很多单机自动机床和机械化自动化生产线，生产面貌日新月异，生产能力步步提高。1月份日产值比去年12月提高18％，2月份又比1月份提高37.3％，一季度计划超额完成了，产值比去年第四季度提高39％。这就可以有条件提前完成全年老产品计划，并陆续抽调工人培训，为新产品提前上场和扩建投入生产创造了良好的条件。第二、技术革命和技术革新使笨重体力劳动日渐消灭，手工操作逐步实现机械化（我厂计划“五一”前基本实现）、自动化，因而使劳动越来越成为一件愉快的事，从而大大激发了广大职工的创造性、积极性，例如我厂用的型钢很多，过去要十九个人用手工大锤调直，既累而且震耳欲聋。工人、技术人员、领导干部三结合，又学习了兄弟厂的经验，几天的时间制成了调直机，只要一个人就行了，既不累也不噪了。像这样的事例很多。“存在决定意识”。生产面貌、技术面貌正在改观，人的精神面貌也在变了。工人不但提高了技术，甚至变成了诗人。他们用诗歌来歌颂这个运动。例如刚才说的例子，工人就这样写：“过去调直大锤敲，如今改用机器调，生产改观人带笑，都因为党的领导好。”技术人员和技术工人的关系也越来越密切了。技术人员说：“三结合”出来的东西就是好，又快又省又好用。像那部调直机，按老办法单靠技术人员，光设计画图就要一个月。特别是最近出现的有许多发明创造，打破了书本上的方法和理论，作出了许多过去所没有的产品，用事实破除了科学技术上的许多迷信，打掉了“厚外薄中”的自卑感。大大坚定了在不久的将来就可攀登世界科学技术高峰的信心。同时“饮水思源”，这一切的成就，都是在党的领导下大搞群众运动才取得的，因此，在技术工作上党的领导和群众路线问题，在许多技术人员中也有了更深刻的体会和认识。这样一来，全厂职工对于技术革新和技术革命运动，就像吃甘蔗一样，从头往根吃，兴致勃勃，越吃越甜。我厂职工提出，今年将要全部调整六个新车间，搞出十个机械化自动化工段，五十条机械化自动化生产线，一千台单机自动和专用机床，三千套工艺装备，并且掌握五十七种新技术（其中十七种是世界水平的）。第三、厂内和各地的技术革命和技术革新的成果，迅速的应用于基本建设，可以节约很多设备和工艺装备，减少很多需要培训的技工和徒工，因而可以大大缩短生产准备的周期。例如我厂新建冲压车间原设计为了避免电焊闪光，厂房内需要盖七个小屋，光线也很不好。设备安装也很挤。现在利用了洛阳拖拉机厂技术革命的成果，采用了自动焊接，设备可以少装，小屋不必再盖，问题解决得很满意。建设速度就大大加快了。第四、土洋结合，能洋就洋，不能洋就土。按我厂的工艺设计和目前订货情况，光专用设备，到明年年底也供不齐。这就不能不在很多方面，采用土法上马。而由于技术革命和技术革新的结果，很多土法甚至胜于洋法。这就可以大搞“三边”。例如，新建发动机车间，现在两头的墙还没有砌好，3月份就已经安装了一百余台机床，4月1日就有一百二十台机床试车陆续投入生产。关于协作我们最近也有很多体会。就我厂的技术力量说，技术人员的力量只及今年工作需要的三分之一。但是一方面由于厂内三结合，大量调动了技术工人的力量，另一方面，厂外三结合，取得了清华大学、山东工学院、北京农业机械化学院、吉林工业大学、洛阳工学院、大连机床设计院、工艺研究院等很多单位二百余人来厂支援，因而预计不但可以完成今年的技术工作，而且还能搞出不少尖端产品和技术。此外，我厂也办了农业机械学院，也可有所帮助。另外，我厂最近又与开封机械厂初步商定，明年上半年先由我厂生产，联合收割机的发动机和底盘，由开封厂生产切割、脱谷和集草部分，并装成成品。这样又可大大缩短生产准备周期。顺便提一下，我们体会，除了中央必要时仍须保留少数成套生产联合收割机的厂外，如果由中央厂供应发动机和底盘，而比较容易制造的切割、脱谷等部分，今后改由地方组织工厂制造配装，将会更能加速农业机械化的实现，并能因地制宜节约很多运输力量。
    各位代表，我国当前的形势，正像李先念副总理所说：“经济兴隆，财源茂盛，物价稳定，库存增加。”真是满园春色，一片好风光。也正如毛主席的沁园春诗中所写的“江山如此多娇，引无数英雄尽折腰”。我们祖国在党的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗招展下，全国人民都成了英雄好汉。在这大好的形势下，我们北京农业机械厂的职工，虽然面临着技术力量不足、设备不足、材料不足，特别是施工力量不足等等困难，但是我们立志鼓足干劲，力争上游，在中央农业机械部和北京市委的正确领导下，在兄弟厂和广大农民弟兄的支援下，保证提前一个季度完成今年老产品的任务，把扩建后才能供应的新产品提前一年供应，并且誓将胜利地提前完成国家下达的扩建任务。
