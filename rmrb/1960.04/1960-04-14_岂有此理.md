    This is outrageous!	Poem by Chi Beiou, Illustration by Fang Cheng
    An American broker named Barnes wrote a letter to the Cuban government, making the absurd request to purchase the entire island of Cuba for 10 billion US dollars. This was met with a stern rejection and rebuttal from the Cuban government. This broker even went so far as to say he was "disappointed with the Cuban government's attitude."
    I have plenty of American dollars,
    Isn't everything in the world for sale?
    The land of Turkey,
    The treasures of the Louvre,
    The loyalty of the South Korean President,
    The charming smiles of Tokyo geishas…
    Money is omnipotent!
    Who dares not to bow before it?
    Now I've set my sights on the island of Cuba,
    Willing to offer a high price to close the deal,
    You get what you pay for,
    A $10 billion price tag is not a small amount.
    Who knew this poor fool would not appreciate my kindness,
    Refusing to sell and scolding me for being ridiculous.
    This is outrageous!
    Armed intervention sooner rather than later.

    岂有此理	池北偶诗　方成画
    一名叫巴恩斯的美国经纪写信给古巴政府，提出以一百亿美元购买整个古巴岛的荒谬要求，遭到了古巴政府的严词拒绝和驳斥。这个掮客竟然还说什么“对古巴政府的态度感到失望”。
    老子有的是美钞，
    世上什么东西买不到？
    土耳其的土地，
    罗浮宫的珍宝，
    南朝鲜总统的忠诚，
    东京歌妓的媚笑……
    金元万能！
    谁敢在它面前不折腰？
    现在看上古巴岛，
    愿出高价来成交，
    一分货给一分钱，
    百亿美元的代价不算少。
    没想到穷措大不识好歹，
    不肯出卖还骂我胡闹。
    岂有此理！
    武装干涉迟不如早。
