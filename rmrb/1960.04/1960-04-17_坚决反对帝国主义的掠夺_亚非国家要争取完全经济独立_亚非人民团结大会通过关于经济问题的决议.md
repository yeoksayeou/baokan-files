Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 15th – The resolution on economic issues passed by the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference points out that only economic independence can enable Asian and African countries to successfully repel the conspiracies of imperialists. The resolution states that, therefore, the conference declares that the struggle for complete economic independence is the primary task of Asian and African countries that have already achieved political independence today.

The resolution states that the conference reiterates that we cannot consider our struggle for independence complete until we, the people of Asia and Africa, eliminate economic inequality and establish a sound and independent economy.

The resolution states that, in order to realize the economic independence of Asian and African countries, the conference demands: that the people of all Asian and African countries work together to fight against imperialism and strongly support steps to achieve universal disarmament; strive to eliminate foreign economic control over Asian and African countries; reaffirm that they should strengthen their own economies as much as possible through their own efforts and through increasing cooperation and mutual assistance among them; take steps to promote agriculture and improve the living conditions of farmers, the main steps being land reform, the development of cooperatives, and the use of modern tools; support governments that strive to develop the state-owned economy and national planning as important means of accelerating economic development; develop cooperation between Asian and African countries as much as possible in order to achieve equal status in the world market; expand relations with industrialized countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs, and resolutely fight against any attempt to use economic and technical cooperation to achieve political and military purposes. The resolution states that the conference notes with satisfaction the concrete development of the Bandung spirit of close cooperation in economic and commercial fields among Asian and African countries, and is pleased to see that the liberated countries of Asia and Africa are making determined efforts to restore their economies damaged by imperialist plunder.

The resolution states that, however, the vestiges of the colonial period still weigh heavily on many Asian and African countries like a heavy millstone. The economies of Asian and African countries are still unilaterally developed, and continue to be based on the export of raw materials. Foreign capital still occupies a powerful position in the economies of many Asian and African countries. The resolution states that imperialist colonial countries are clearly aware that Asian and African countries are striving to restore complete control over their wealth and resources, and therefore they are closely colluding in an attempt to frustrate our efforts and want to keep Asian and African countries as appendages providing raw materials for their own industries and economies. The conference condemns the European "Common Market," the International Development Association, and the plan proposed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon to organize an economic group based on the aggressive North Atlantic group, and believes that all of this is aimed at continuing to make the economies of Asian and African countries economies that produce raw materials, and at enriching the colonial countries at our expense.

The resolution states that the conference wishes to remind Asian and African countries of this new danger of collective imperialism. The purpose of this imperialism or neo-colonialism is profit, and it attempts to control our wealth. The resolution states that, therefore, the conference believes that unless Asian and African countries increase their vigilance and intensify their efforts to achieve economic independence, the independence we have gained may be jeopardized.

The resolution states that the conference reaffirms the resolution of the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, namely that we are not opposed to foreign investment or foreign loans, provided that such investment or loans are not attached to political conditions that stipulate the granting of privileges. The resolution also states that, given that foreign investment in Asian and African countries often attempts to usurp our sovereignty, the conference therefore proposes and supports the demand for the nationalization of foreign capital in all such cases. Because in this case, nationalizing foreign capital is the only way to deal with persistent bad attempts to establish foreign control and to deal with the danger of significant losses due to the export of profits from our countries.

In discussing the two types of foreign aid given to Asian and African countries, the resolution states that one type of aid mainly comes from industrialized countries, and the purpose of this "aid" seems to be to keep Asian and African countries mainly in the position of agricultural and raw material producers, and to obstruct the industrialization of our countries. This "aid" has become a means of solving the economic problems of developed countries at our expense, and attempts to transfer the economic difficulties of large countries to us. The other type of aid, on the contrary, is selfless aid from friendly, anti-imperialist countries, aimed at helping us to industrialize and helping us to maximize the use of our domestic strength.

The conference declares that this new type of relationship that is rapidly developing between Asian and African countries and countries that oppose imperialism is a source of our strength and confidence, and this relationship strengthens our strength to achieve our task of economic independence.

The resolution points out that the World Bank is unwilling to immediately help the fragile economies of underdeveloped countries. The resolution states that the conference strongly protests the activities of this bank, because it has repeatedly supported the most disgraceful plans of imperialist exploitation.

The resolution also calls on Asian and African countries to sever economic relations with the South African government.

The resolution states that the conference believes that in-depth research should be conducted on the issues of economic development and national planning in Asian and African countries, and therefore decides to establish a permanent committee to study Asian and African economic issues, and decides to distribute documents on this issue and prepare for the Asian and African planning conference.

    坚决反对帝国主义的掠夺
    亚非国家要争取完全经济独立
    亚非人民团结大会通过关于经济问题的决议
    据新华社科纳克里15日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会通过的关于经济问题的决议指出，只有经济独立才能使亚非国家成功地击退帝国主义者的阴谋。决议说，因此大会宣布，争取完全的经济独立的斗争，是已经取得政治独立的亚非国家今天的主要任务。
    决议说，大会再次强调，在我们亚非人民消灭经济不平等、建立一个健全和独立的经济之前，我们不能认为我们的争取独立的斗争已经完成。
    决议说，为了实现亚非国家的经济独立，大会要求：亚非各国人民一致努力为反对帝国主义而斗争、大力支持实现普遍裁军的步骤；努力消除外国对亚非国家的经济的控制；重申通过亚非国家自己的努力和它们中间的日益加强的合作和互助来尽量加强它们自己的经济；采取步骤来促进农业和改善农民的生活条件，其中主要的步骤是实行土地改革、发展合作社和使用现代化工具；支持力求发展国营经济和国家计划工作作为加速经济发展的重要手段的各国政府；尽量发展亚非国家之间的合作，以利于在世界市场上取得平等的地位；在平等互利和互不干涉内政的基础上扩大同工业发达的国家之间的关系，并对利用经济和技术合作来达到政治和军事目的的任何企图进行坚决的斗争。决议说，大会满意地注意到亚非国家在经济和商业方面密切合作的万隆会议精神有了具体的发展，并且高兴地看到，亚非解放了的国家正在为恢复它们被帝国主义掠夺所破坏的经济而作出坚定的努力。
    决议说，但是，殖民地时期的遗毒仍然像一块沉重的磨石一样压在许多亚非国家的头上。亚非国家的经济仍然是片面发展的，它继续建立在出口原料的基础上。外国资本在许多亚非国家的经济中仍然占据着有力的地位。决议说，帝国主义殖民国家清楚地知道，亚非国家正在努力恢复对自己的财富和资源的完全支配权，因此它们正在紧密地勾结起来，企图挫败我们的努力，并想保持亚非国家继续成为它们本国工业和经济提供原料的附庸。大会谴责欧洲“共同市场”、国际开发协会和美国副国务卿狄龙提出的组织以侵略性的北大西洋集团为基础的经济集团的计划，并认为这一切的目的都是要使亚非国家的经济继续成为生产原料的经济，并且在使我们遭到牺牲的情况下，使殖民国家发财致富。
    决议说，大会希望提醒亚非国家注意这个集体的帝国主义的新危险。这种帝国主义或新殖民主义的目的是利润，它企图控制我们的财富。决议说，因此大会认为，除亚非国家提高警惕，加紧努力争取经济独立，否则，我们所获得的独立可能受到危害。
    决议说，大会重申第一届亚非人民团结大会的决议，即我们不反对外国投资或外国贷款，只要这种投资或贷款不附有规定给予特权的政治条件。决议还说，鉴于在亚非国家里的外国投资经常企图篡夺我们的主权，因此，大会提出并支持在所有这种情况下把外国资本国有化的要求。因为在这种情况下，把外国资本国有化是对付一贯想建立外国控制的不良企图和对付由于从我们这些国家输出利润而带来重大损失的危险的唯一手段。
    在谈到给予亚非国家的两种外国援助时，决议说，一种援助主要是来自工业发达的国家，这种“援助”的目的似乎是使亚非国家保持主要是农业和原料生产者的地位，并阻挠我们国家的工业化。这种“援助”成为在使我们遭到牺牲的情况下解决发达国家的经济问题的一种手段，并企图把大国的经济困难转嫁到我们身上来。另一种援助与此相反，它是友好的、反对帝国主义的国家的无私援助，目的是帮助我们实行工业化，帮助我们最大限度地利用我们的国内力量。
    大会宣布，正在亚非国家和反对帝国主义的国家之间迅速发展着的这种新型的关系是我们的力量和信心的源泉，这种关系加强了我们的力量来实现我们的经济独立的任务。
    决议指出，世界银行不愿立即帮助不发达国家的稚弱的经济。决议说，大会要对这个银行的活动提出强烈的抗议，因为它一再支持最不光彩的帝国主义剥削的计划。
    决议还号召亚非国家断绝同南非政府之间的经济关系。
    决议说，大会认为应当对亚非国家的经济发展和国家计划工作问题进行深入的研究，因此决定建立一个常设委员会来研究亚非经济问题，并决定散发有关这个问题的文件，并为亚非计划会议作好准备。
