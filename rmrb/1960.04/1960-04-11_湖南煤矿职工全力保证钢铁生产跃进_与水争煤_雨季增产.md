Hunan Coal Mine Workers Strive to Ensure the Leap Forward in Steel Production
Seizing Coal from Water, Increasing Production During the Rainy Season

(Our dispatch from Changsha, April 10th) Coal mine workers on the Hunan Province coal industry front, after achieving a great victory in the first quarter of production, have launched a red flag emulation campaign to "Seize Coal from Water, Increase Production During the Rainy Season, and Guarantee Steel Production with Coal," in order to achieve a sustained leap forward in coal industry production in 1960.

Hunan Province has fulfilled and overfulfilled the state's first-quarter production plans for raw coal and coke ahead of schedule, increasing production by 3.8% and 9% respectively compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and growing by 66% and 60% respectively compared to the same period last year. However, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production throughout the province, new demands have been placed on coal industry production, especially as the second-quarter steel production plan has seen a significant increase compared to the first quarter, requiring more raw coal and coke. At the same time, the second quarter in the Hunan region experiences more rainy days, which brings certain difficulties to coal industry production. Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province mobilized the masses and adopted many effective measures to ensure that coal production in the second quarter exceeds the production level of the first quarter.

Implementing the policy of "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment," and vigorously grasping water prevention and treatment work in coal mines to ensure increased production during the rainy season, is the primary measure for increasing coal production in Hunan Province. Based on the characteristics of Hunan's coal mines, with abundant surface water and the harm caused by old mine water, Party committees at all levels have mobilized the masses since December of last year to focus on preventing and treating surface water and old mine water, adopting methods that primarily utilize local resources and combine indigenous and foreign methods. As of the end of March, coal mines throughout the province had built 170,000 meters of drainage ditches within the mining areas, filled 930,000 meters of cracks, filled 27,000+ open pits in subsidence areas, and sealed 3,108 old mine entrances, greatly preventing surface water and old mine water from flowing into the mine shafts. At the same time, measures such as building water reservoirs, sluice gates, and increasing indigenous and foreign drainage tools were also adopted to prevent and treat water within the mines. According to incomplete statistics, coal mines throughout the province have newly opened 359 water reservoirs in more than two months, with a water storage capacity of over 89,000 tons. Since the end of February, most areas of Hunan Province have experienced continuous rainfall, and some coal mining faces have been flooded. Under the slogan of "Prevent if there is no water, rush to rescue if there is water," workers have engaged in the battle of "Seizing Coal from Water." Because the water prevention and treatment work in coal mines throughout the province was grasped early and solidly, sustained leap forward in production was still guaranteed during the rainy season.

Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, focusing on liberating heavy labor, simplifying production processes, and saving pit props, is also an important reason for the continuous increase in coal production in Hunan Province. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, coal mines prominently focused on the weak links of mining, excavation, loading, transportation, hoisting, crushing, and washing, and vigorously promoted indigenous and foreign mechanization as a unified system, and vigorously promoted indigenous and foreign mechanization and semi-mechanization. Workers in coal enterprises throughout the province put forward more than 250,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 90,000 have been implemented. According to incomplete statistics from 102 small and medium-sized coal mines, as of mid-March, the five production links from mining and excavation to washing and selecting have basically achieved indigenous and foreign mechanization and semi-mechanization as a unified system. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, coal mines in various regions vigorously promoted new coal mining methods and four (shifts) eight (hours) staggered operations. Up to now, 55.6% of the coal mines in the province have promoted new coal mining methods such as short-wall, long-wall, step-type, and horizontal layering, and approximately 57% of the coal mines have promoted four-eight staggered operations, greatly improving labor productivity and reducing labor intensity. The province has saved 17,500+ laborers.

In order to ensure balanced and sustained leap forward in coal industry production, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently adopted new measures, requiring coal mines in various regions to give equal importance to production and tunneling, production and transportation, and production and infrastructure construction. While focusing on production, they are to strengthen transportation, continuously increase coal production, and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production. General coal mines have established specialized coal and coke transportation teams to strengthen transportation work, and build coal storage warehouses and coal chutes, etc., to achieve a certain amount of coal storage, ensuring that production is not affected if trucks do not arrive for three to seven days, and that there is coal to transport if trucks arrive when there is no production for three to seven days. In terms of infrastructure construction, it is required to concentrate efforts, ensure key projects, and follow the principle of building a batch before building another batch, putting those with suitable conditions into production in the second quarter. The Provincial Party Committee has also organized cadres from relevant departments such as coal, transportation, and machinery manufacturing to form a working group led by Comrade Li Ruishan, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, to go to various coal mines and railway stations to inspect coal production and transportation work, and to ensure that coal industry production in the second quarter exceeds the production level of the first quarter.

    湖南煤矿职工全力保证钢铁生产跃进
    与水争煤　雨季增产
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省煤炭工业战线上的职工，在取得首季生产大捷以后，又掀起了“与水争煤、雨季增产、以煤保钢”，夺取二季度大面积丰产的红旗竞赛运动，以实现1960年煤炭工业生产持续跃进。
    湖南省已提前和超额完成一季度国家原煤和焦炭的生产计划，比去年四季度分别提高3.8％和9％，比去年同期增长66％和60％。但是，随着全省工农业生产飞跃发展，对煤炭工业生产提出了更新的要求，特别是二季度钢铁生产计划比一季度又有很大的增长，需要更多的原煤和焦炭；同时，二季度湖南地区雨天多，给煤炭工业生产带来了一定困难。湖南省各级党委发动群众，采取许多有效措施来保证二季度煤炭产量超过一季度生产水平。
    贯彻“以防为主，防治并举”的方针，大抓煤矿的防水治水工作确保雨季增产，是湖南省煤炭增产的首要措施。根据湖南省煤矿地面水多和老窿水为害的特点，各级党委从去年12月份以来，就发动群众，采取以土为主，土洋结合的办法，大抓防治地面水和老窿水。截至3月底止，全省各煤矿在矿区境内修排水沟达十七万米，填裂缝九十三万米、填塌陷区露天坑二万七千多米、填堵老窿口三千一百零八个，大大防止了地面水和老窿水流入矿井内。同时还采取建水仓、闸门和增加土洋排水工具的办法防治井内水。据不完全统计，全省各煤矿在两个多月时间内新开水仓三百五十九个，能容水八万九千余吨。2月底以来，湖南省各地大部分地区连续降雨，部分采煤垱头被淹，职工们在“无水就防，有水就抢”的口号下，投入了“与水争煤”战斗。由于全省煤矿的防治水工作抓得早、抓得扎实，在多雨的季节，仍然保证了生产持续跃进。
    以解放笨重劳动、简化生产过程和节约坑木为主攻方向，大闹技术革新和技术革命，也是湖南省煤炭持续增产的重要原因。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，各煤矿突出地抓住采掘、装运、提升、破碎、洗选等薄弱环节，以土洋机械化一条龙为纲，大搞土洋机械化和半机械化。全省煤炭企业的职工共提出二十五万多条革新建议，已实现九万多条。据一百零二个中小型煤矿的不完全统计，截至3月中旬止，从采掘到洗选五个生产环节，基本上实现了土洋机械化和半机械化一条龙。各地煤矿在技术革新和技术革命运动中，大力推广了新的采煤法和四（班）八（小时）交叉作业。到目前为止，全省有55.6％的煤矿推广了短壁式、长壁式、台阶式、水平分层等新的采煤方法，约有57％的煤矿推广了四八交叉作业，大大提高了劳动生产率，减轻了劳动强度。全省节约劳动力达一万七千五百多人。
    为了保证煤炭工业生产均衡持续跃进，最近中共湖南省委采取新的措施，要求各地煤矿生产与掘进并举、生产与调运并举、生产与基建并举，以生产为主，抓紧调运，不断增加煤炭生产，满足工农业生产的需要。一般煤矿都成立了煤焦调运专业队，加强调运工作，并修建储煤仓和溜煤槽等，达到有一定数量的存煤，做到三至七天不去车，不影响生产，三至七天不生产，去了车有煤运。在基建方面，要求根据集中力量、保证重点的方针，和建好一批再建一批的原则，条件具备的在二季度投入生产。省委还组织煤炭、交通运输、机械制造等有关部门干部成立工作组，由省委书记李瑞山同志率领，分赴各煤矿和车站，进行检查煤炭生产和调运工作，保证二季度煤炭工业生产一定要超过一季度生产水平。
