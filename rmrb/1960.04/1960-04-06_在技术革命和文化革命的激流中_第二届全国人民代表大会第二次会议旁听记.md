In the Tide of Technological and Cultural Revolutions
　　--Notes from Attending the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress
　　By Our Staff Reporter

　　Technical Revolution Opens the Treasure House of Mass Wisdom
　　Spring thunder-like applause erupted in the hall, welcoming Su Guangming, a "pace-setter" of technical revolution from Harbin. This engineer, with thirty-two years of work experience and an old milling machine operator by trade, vividly described how he transformed an "old-as-the-hills" milling machine into a modern photoelectric program-controlled milling machine.

　　The lathe used by Su Guangming was originally an old-style belt lathe manufactured in Germany in 1928. Because it had been used for too many years, many parts were replacements. It rattled and clanked when it started, turning slowly at only one hundred and fifty revolutions per minute, resulting in low production efficiency. Over the years, with the encouragement and support of the Party, Su Guangming and his partners cooperated to improve this "old ox" milling machine more than a hundred times, transforming it into a semi-automated milling machine, increasing the speed to six hundred and fifty revolutions per minute.

　　Last November, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to march towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Su Guangming was so excited that he couldn't sleep for several nights. He thought, "I am an old worker, I should have lofty ambitions, I must dare to think and dare to act. We must have what the world has, and we must have what the world doesn't have." Therefore, in February of this year, with the strong support of other units, Su Guangming worked hard for seventeen days and nights, and after more than twenty repeated tests, he finally transformed his old milling machine into a photoelectric program-controlled automated milling machine.

　　Su Guangming's milling machine has five red stars hanging on it, which are the glorious marks of his continuous technical revolution. Over the years, he has tirelessly learned more than fifty advanced domestic and foreign experiences, realized more than one hundred and thirty technical innovations, and has always been ahead of time. Now, he is already working on the job scheduled for August 1971.

　　Su Guangming is one of the thousands upon thousands of "trailblazers" who have emerged in China's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Now, this mass movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is advancing at an unprecedented scale. In the hall of the National People's Congress, representatives from various fronts of industry, agriculture, and transportation described the people's great ambitions to march towards backward technology and the brilliant achievements they have already made.

　　Qiu Xinye, a representative from Fuxin City, an important base of China's coal industry, introduced the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in this mining area.

　　The prairie fire of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Fuxin City was ignited by the successful creation of a coal-shoveling machine. To put down their shovels, the coal-shoveling workers had proposed more than one hundred solutions. In 1959, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of "Never give up until success, never stop promoting until popularization, never stop until complete victory," leading the coal mine workers to successfully create the first coal-shoveling machine, and popularizing it widely in a short period of time. As a result, more than two thousand coal-shoveling workers in this mining area bid farewell forever to the large iron shovels they had used for generations, and the efficiency of coal-shoveling jumped by four to five times.

　　The making and promotion of the coal-shoveling machine, like a key, opened the treasure house of mass wisdom. A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization was launched rapidly in Fuxin City.

　　In the rural areas of southern China, a major revolution in rice cultivation technology is underway—vigorously promoting the use of rice transplanters. The ideal that the vast number of farmers had dreamed of for thousands of years, using machines to replace manual rice transplanting, has begun to be realized. Yan Renhai, a representative from Hunan Province, said that Hunan Province is carrying out a tool reform movement centered on the promotion and use of simple rice transplanters. By March 20th, 380,000 rice transplanters had been manufactured, and more than 800,000 rice transplanter operators had been trained in more than 70 counties and cities. The rice transplanters promoted in Hunan Province are mostly the "Liling No. 2" simple rice transplanter, which is one of the seven rice transplanters finalized at this year's National Rice Transplanter Evaluation Conference. This rice transplanter has high work efficiency, good transplanting quality, easy operation, simple structure, easy availability of materials, and low cost. According to the results of comparative experiments conducted in Liling and other counties, machine transplanting increases work efficiency by more than three times compared to manual transplanting, and increases production by 5% to 15%. After the commune members used the rice transplanter, they were all overjoyed. They sang, "For thousands of years, no machine has ever transplanted rice. Manual transplanting is a bitter thing, face to the mud, back to the sky, back pain, hand broken, it is difficult to transplant three cents of land a day. Rice transplanters have many advantages, hands are not broken, back is not hunched; the body is light and easy to operate, can catch the season and can be advanced. The realization of mechanization of rice transplanting, increased grain production makes everyone happy."

　　The transportation sector, known as the "vanguard" of various departments of the national economy, is carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in what way? Guo Shude, the chief of Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau, reported to the conference on the work of mechanizing loading and unloading, transforming "earth humps" into "foreign humps," and transforming locomotives in the Beijing area.

　　Since the beginning of February, railway workers in the Beijing area have launched a mass upsurge of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading. More than 50,000 people in more than 400 units, after more than 20 days of hard work, manufactured more than 4,900 pieces of loading and unloading machinery, which basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading at the seven major freight stations around Beijing; then, in March, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading at many medium and small stations was realized. In the past, it took two hundred people forty minutes to unload a train of coal; now, thanks to the workers' transformation of the vehicles and the use of wind-powered automatic door switches, only one person needs to move the operating handle to unload a train of coal in a few minutes. The loading and unloading workers were liberated from carrying poles and happily praised the Communist Party, saying: "Shoulder pressure for decades, back pain and leg pain. The Party leads us, engages in mechanization; throw away the sticks and shovels, happiness for ten thousand years."

　　The Storm of Cultural Revolution is About to Sweep Across the Motherland

　　In the technical innovation and technical revolution, the broad masses of workers and peasants eagerly demand to learn culture and improve their scientific and technical level. The farmers in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, deeply felt the pain that "hydraulic engineering, mechanization, cannot be realized without culture" in the construction of water conservancy, large-scale development of indigenous fertilizers, indigenous pesticides, and indigenous machinery, and quickly launched a national learning upsurge. As a result of the farmers' learning culture, the development of production was promoted immediately. The amazing achievements of the county's workers' and peasants' spare-time education show that the great cultural revolution is already in a "the mountain is about to collapse and the wind is filling the building" situation, and the storm of revolution is about to sweep across the land of the motherland.

　　Representative Li Hui wittily introduced the situation of promoting phonetic literacy in Wanrong County at the meeting. 140,000 people participated in the study in this county. The young and middle-aged illiterate people were all literate in an average of only two months. Many elderly women also carry schoolbags, learn Pinyin, and organize "elderly classes." There are also more than 8,700 farmers and rural cadres in the county who have participated in the study of Mao Zedong's works. Nowadays, reading has become a trend among farmers.

　　Reading has led to writing. Farmers in Wanrong County have created more than 1.9 million poems, many of which are excellent, and many rural poets have emerged. Literate farmers also write essays, write letters, and write study notes. Quite a few production team leaders who could not even recognize their own names a year ago are now able to write work assignment slips every day. What is especially moving is that farmers have begun to write applications for joining the Party and the League with their own hands, expressing their ardent desire to fight for communism for the rest of their lives to the Party in words full of sincerity.

　　In the garden of socialist culture and education, the new seedling of "agricultural middle school" is growing vigorously. Guan Wenwei, the deputy governor of Jiangsu Province, today used the beautiful sentence "overnight spring rain, flowers bloom all over the garden" to describe the grand occasion when Jiangsu Province began to run agricultural middle schools on a large scale. Running agricultural middle schools on a large scale is a way to develop secondary education undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way. In less than a month, agricultural middle schools have spread all over the vast rural areas in Jiangsu Province, and vocational middle schools have also developed in cities. The era of no culture in rural areas will never return.

　　The development of agricultural middle schools has greatly promoted the technical innovation movement in rural areas. In half-farming and half-study, the schools have created a lot of advanced production technologies and have begun to become strongholds for improving rural culture and popularizing agricultural science and technology.

　　While accelerating the intellectualization of workers and peasants, all levels and types of schools in our country are actively implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. A vigorous education revolution is being carried out extensively. Guo Yingqiu, the president of Nanjing University, reported to the conference that after this higher education institution implemented the three combinations of teaching, labor, and scientific research, it not only significantly improved the quality of teaching, but also enabled students to achieve all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and made them take a big step forward on the path of intellectualizing laborers. In the past year, in addition to establishing eleven intermediate factories and a comprehensive farm as the labor training base for all teachers and students, Nanjing University's liberal arts departments have been linked to factories and people's communes to support industrial and agricultural production. The students who went to the countryside and factories ate, lived, and labored with the workers and peasants, and received vivid and practical education on class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint in contact with the working masses, and cultivated the class feelings of the working people. Teachers and students from the departments of geography, geology, meteorology, and biology, in their field work, carried luggage and tools on their backs, not avoiding strong winds and hot summers, not afraid of storms and severe cold, fought in the deep mountains and vast deserts, often encouraged themselves with the heroic slogan of "When thirsty, think of Shangganling, when hungry, think of the old Red Army," overcame dangers and fatigue, and enthusiastically completed production tasks, completed teaching tasks combined with production, and completed a large number of weighty scientific research work combined with productive labor.

　　In the hall, we met Tao Shufan, whose temples were gray. This old educator, whose students are all over the world, has spent forty years in the glorious position of primary school teacher. Today, she declared enthusiastically and boldly: To establish lofty ambitions and cultivate new communist people!

　　Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School, where Representative Tao Shufan is located, has also established its own small factory and has successively linked up with eight or nine factories to process for various factories according to what the children can do. The elementary school students' productive labor is educational labor. In the labor process, the elementary school students trained their skills and enriched their knowledge. The three hundred and sixty students in the eight senior grades basically mastered the use of planers, saws, axes, and hammers, and some students were able to use planers and small lathes to manufacture small parts for motor factories. Because Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School has implemented the Party's education policy, the teachers' political awareness has been improved, the students' socialist and communist ideology has grown rapidly, and love of labor has become a trend in the school.

　　The day's meeting is over. The boiling scenes of technical revolution and cultural revolution in various places described by the representatives in their speeches have been exciting people's hearts for a long time. The technical revolution and cultural revolution movements sweeping the country have converged into a great force, which will rapidly change the face of our motherland.

    在技术革命和文化革命的激流中
    ——第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议旁听记
  　本报记者
    技术革命打开了群众智慧的宝库
    会场上响起了春雷般的掌声，欢迎来自哈尔滨的技术革命“标兵”苏广铭。这位已经有三十二年工龄的、老铣工出身的工程师，生动地叙述了自己怎样把一部“老掉了牙”的铣床，变成一部现代化的光电程序控制铣床。
    苏广铭使用的车床，本来是一部1928年德国制造的旧式皮带车床，因为使用的年头太多，许多部件是后来配的，一开车就叮当乱响，慢悠悠的，一分钟只能转一百五十转，生产效率很低。几年来，苏广铭在党的鼓励和支持下，和他的伙伴们合作，对这部“老牛”铣床，进行了一百多次改进，把它变成了一部半自动化的铣床，每分钟的转速增加到六百五十转。
    去年11月，中共黑龙江省委和哈尔滨市委发出了向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军的号召，苏广铭激动得几夜没睡好觉。他想：“我是一个老工人，应该有雄心壮志，要敢想敢干，世界上有的我们要有，世界上没有的我们也要有。”于是，今年2月，苏广铭在其他单位的大力支持下，苦战了十七个昼夜，经过二十多次反复试验，终于把他的老铣床改制成了光电程序控制的自动化铣床。
    苏广铭的这部铣床上面，挂着五颗红星，这是他不断地进行技术革命的光荣标记。几年来，他孜孜不倦地学会了五十多种国内外的先进经验，实现了一百三十多项技术革新，一直跑在时间的前面。现在，他已经在做1971年8月的活了。
    苏广铭是我国技术革新和技术革命运动中涌现出来的千千万万个“闯将”中的一个。现在，这个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的群众运动，正以前所未有的规模，奔腾前进，在人民代表大会的会场上，工业、农业、交通运输业各个战线上的代表们，叙述了各地人民向落后技术进军的雄心大志以及他们已经取得的光辉成就。
    我国煤炭工业重要基地之一——阜新市的代表丘新野，介绍了这个煤矿区的技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃开展的情景。
    阜新市的技术革新和技术革命运动的燎原之火，是从一台攉煤机的创造成功点燃起来的。攉煤工人们为了放下铁锹，曾经提出过一百多种方案。1959年，中共阜新市委提出“不成功不罢休，不推广不罢休，不获全胜不罢休”的口号，领导煤矿职工创造成功了第一台攉煤机，并且在短短的时间内普遍推广。于是，这个煤矿区二千多名攉煤工人同世世代代使用的大铁锹永远告别，攉煤效率一跃提高了四、五倍。
    攉煤机的制成和推广，像一把钥匙一样，打开了群众智慧的宝库。一个以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，便在阜新市迅猛的开展起来。
    在祖国南方的农村，正在进行着一场水稻栽培技术上的大革命——大力推广使用水稻插秧机。千百年来广大农民梦寐以求的用机器代替手工插秧的理想，已经开始实现。湖南省的代表言仁海说，湖南省正在开展一个以推广使用简易插秧机为中心的工具改革运动，到3月20日已经制造三十八万部插秧机，有七十多个县、市培养了八十多万插秧机操作手。湖南省推广的插秧机，绝大多数是“醴陵二号”简易插秧机，这是经过今年的全国插秧机评比会议定型的七种插秧机之一。这种插秧机工效高，插秧质量好，操作轻便，而且结构简单，取材容易，成本低廉。据醴陵等县进行对比试验的结果，机插比手插工效提高三倍以上，增产5％到15％。社员们用上插秧机后，个个欢欣鼓舞。他们歌唱道：“自古相传几千年，没有机器插过田。用手插秧苦难言，脸朝泥巴背朝天，腰酸背痛手插破，一天难插三分田。插秧机来好处多，手不破来背不驼；一身轻便操作巧，能赶季节能提早。插秧实现机械化，粮食增产人人欢。”
    被誉为国民经济各部门的“先行官”的交通运输部门，是在怎样进行技术革新和技术革命呢？北京铁路局丰台机务段段长郭树德向大会汇报了北京地区进行装卸机械化、改造“土驼峰”成为“洋驼峰”和改造机车的工作。
    北京地区的铁路职工，从2月初开始掀起了一个全民性的大搞装卸机械化、半机械化的高潮，四百多个单位，五万多人，经过二十多天的奋战，制造了四千九百多件装卸机具，使北京城周围七个主要货运站的装卸，基本实现了机械化和半机械化；紧接着又在3月份实现了许多中、小车站的装卸机械化和半机械化。过去，卸一列车煤，二百人需要四十分钟时间；现在，由于职工们改造了车辆，利用风力自动开关车门，只要一个人搬一下操作柄，几分钟内就把一列车煤哗哗地卸完了。装卸工人们从扛棍下解放出来，愉快地歌颂共产党说：肩压几十年，腰疼腿又酸。党来领导咱，大搞机械化；抛掉棍和锹，幸福万万年。
    文化革命的风暴即将席卷祖国各地
    广大工农群众在技术革新和技术革命中，如饥如渴地要求学习文化，要求提高科学技术水平。山西省万荣县农民在兴修水利、大搞土化肥、土农药和土机械中，就深深感到“水利化，机械化，没有文化不能化”的痛苦，很快掀起全民性的学习高潮。农民学文化的结果，立竿见影地促进了生产的发展。这个县工农业余教育的惊人成就，展示着伟大的文化革命已呈“山雨欲来风满楼”之势，革命的风暴即将席卷祖国的大地。
    李辉代表在会上饶有风趣地介绍了万荣县推行注音识字法的情景。这个县有十四万人参加学习，青壮年文盲平均只用两个月的时间，全部脱了盲。许多老年妇女也背书包、学拼音，组织“老年班”。全县还有八千七百多个农民和农村干部，参加了毛泽东著作的学习。如今，农民读书已成了风气。
    阅读带动了写作，万荣县农民已经创作诗歌一百九十多万首，其中有不少优秀作品，也出现了不少农村诗人。脱盲农民还作文、写信、写读书笔记。好些一年前连自己姓名也不识的生产队长，现在能够每天写调工牌。尤其使人感动的是，农民开始用自己的手写入党和入团申请书，用充满真情实意的话，向党表达出一生为共产主义奋斗的热烈愿望。
    在社会主义文化教育的园地里，“农业中学”这一株新苗，正在茁壮地成长。江苏省副省长管文蔚，今天用“一夜春雨，满园花开”的佳句，描画了江苏省开始大办农业中学时的盛况。大办农业中学，是一条多快好省地发展中等教育事业的途径。江苏省在不到一个月的时间里，农业中学就遍布广大农村，职业中学也随着在城市中发展起来。农村没有文化的时代，一去不再复返。
    农业中学的发展，大大推动了农村的技术革新运动。学校在半耕半读中，创造了不少先进生产技术，开始成为提高农村文化、推广农业科学技术的据点。
    在加速工农群众知识化的同时，我国各级各类的学校，都在积极贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。轰轰烈烈的教育革命，正在广泛进行。南京大学校长郭影秋代表向大会汇报，这个高等学校实行教学、劳动和科学研究三结合以后，不仅显著地提高了教学质量，并且使学生在德育、智育、体育方面获得全面发展，使他们向知识分子劳动化的途程前进了一大步。一年来，南京大学除了建立十一个中间工厂和一个综合性农场，做为全校师生的劳动锻炼基地以外，文科各系分别和工厂、人民公社挂钩，支援工农业生产。下乡下厂的同学，和工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动，在与劳动群众接触中，受到生动实际的阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点的教育，培养了劳动人民的阶级感情。地理、地质、气象、生物各系的师生，在野外劳动中，身背行李和工具，不避烈风酷暑，不畏暴风严寒，战斗在深山野岭和广阔无垠的沙漠中，常以“口渴想起上甘岭，饥饿想起老红军”的豪迈口号鼓舞自己，战胜险阻和疲困，热情洋溢地完成了生产任务，完成了结合生产的教学任务，结合生产劳动完成了大量的、有分量的科学研究工作。
    在会场上，我们见到了双鬓花白的陶淑范。这位桃李遍天下的老教育家，在小学教师的光荣岗位上，已经整整度过了四十年的岁月。今天，她热情而豪迈地宣称：要立下雄心大志，培养共产主义的新人！
    陶淑范代表所在的北京第二实验小学，也建立了自己的小工厂，并先后和八、九个工厂挂钩，按照孩子们力所能及的，为各工厂进行加工。小学生的生产劳动，是教育性的劳动。在劳动过程中，小学生锻炼了技能，丰富了知识。高年级八个班的三百六十个学生，基本上掌握了刨、锯、斧、锤的使用技术，一部分学生已经能够使用刨床、小车床为电机厂制造小零件。北京第二实验小学由于贯彻执行了党的教育方针，教师的政治觉悟提高了，学生们的社会主义、共产主义思想迅速成长，爱劳动已经成为学校里的一种风气。
    一天的会议结束了。代表们在发言中所描绘的各地技术革命和文化革命的沸腾情景，经久激动着人们的心。席卷全国的技术革命和文化革命运动，已经汇合成一股伟大的力量，它将使我们祖国的面貌迅速改观。
