Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Financial Statement for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," and I will conscientiously implement them in my future work. Now, I will give a brief report to the leaders and delegates on the process of mechanization of the oil production workshop at the Siping Oil and Wine Factory.

In 1959, our workshop, like the workshops of fraternal factories across the country, achieved new successes based on the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Under the correct leadership of the Party committee, all the workers in the workshop, through vigorously launching mass movements and engaging in technological revolution, overcame various difficulties. After nine months of arduous struggle, they realized the oil workers' aspirations and transformed solvent oil extraction into mechanized leaching production. The quality of the oil reached first-class standards. The daily processing capacity increased from 37 tons to 120 tons, and the oil extraction efficiency increased from 77.94% to 92.52%. The number of production workers in the entire workshop was reduced by three-quarters compared to the past, and the daily output increased by more than three times. Each hundred catties of soybeans produced three or four more catties of oil than solvent extraction. Calculated on the basis of ten months per year, this resulted in an additional 900,000 kilograms of oil, equivalent to saving 6,000 tons of soybeans. Moreover, the cost was greatly reduced, with the actual cost per ton of soybean oil reduced by 24.38% compared to the past. Through this revolution, the production landscape of the workshop was completely changed.

As everyone knows, China has a history of manual screw-press oil extraction for over a century. In the old society, the working conditions for oil extraction were harsh, and the intensity of physical labor was high. Many oil extraction workers lost their happy later years, and some became disabled. After liberation, thanks to the attention and care of the Party and the government, labor protection conditions have been improved year by year while production has developed. However, the heavy manual operations of the production method inherited from history have not been fundamentally changed. Workers still have to deal with the "oil lever" in temperatures of forty degrees Celsius. Since the Great Leap Forward, the factory's Party committee has set us the fighting goal of "getting rid of the big oil lever in oil extraction and realizing mechanized production." From then on, the workers in our workshop made great ambitions and resolutely responded to the Party's call.

Because the workers all suffered from it and knew the harm it caused, the oil workers in the past circulated such a ballad:

    Dust fills the room, softening requires carrying,
    Heating, turning and airing, steaming pot roasts,
    Carrying trays back and forth, piling stalks bending over,
    Pushing the lever exhausts, scraping the cake burns hands and feet,
    Operating sweats like rain, often catching colds.
    (Occupational diseases of oil workers)

    In this way, people age before their time. Therefore, the oil workers' desire to be freed from heavy physical labor as soon as possible is urgent. However, some individuals expressed doubts about the Party committee's proposed direction of "self-reliance, making use of existing conditions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and realizing mechanization." They said, "We have no funds, no equipment, and not even anyone who understands the technology. Can a few oil artisans achieve mechanized leaching? If we mess it up, we may lose the glorious title of advanced workshop." Comrades who had visited the Dalian Leaching Plant also worried, saying, "Leaching production is not simple. The tanks are like forests, the pipes are like nets. We can't do it. Even if we do, we can't master it. If we don't do it well, it will be dangerous." In response to this ideological situation, the Party committee promptly organized the masses to launch a debate, criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking that was satisfied with the status quo, and countered this adverse current, strengthening and encouraging the workers' confidence in achieving mechanization. So, in the beginning of the reconstruction, all the oil piles were pulled out. Just as things were going well, the equipment manufacturing tasks originally scheduled to be processed by various machinery factories in the city could not be completed in time, and the masses in our factory were not fully mobilized, delaying the start-up time. Therefore, some people wavered again. Their performance before was fearing the wolf in front, and now they are a bit afraid of the tiger behind. Even the factory director felt unsure. At this critical moment, the Party committee loudly proposed the determination to "break through thousands of difficulties and resolutely carry it to the end." So, it mobilized all the workers in the factory to offer solutions, and with revolutionary spirit, began to declare war on difficulties.

What difficulties did we encounter? The first difficulty was the funding barrier. To manufacture a complete set of leaching equipment, calculated according to the total value, required an investment of three million yuan. Such a large amount of money could not be obtained from higher authorities. Therefore, we first negotiated with the grain department and adopted the method of advance loans, pre-borrowing 160,000 yuan, which would be repaid in the future by increasing the oil extraction rate. In the process of reconstruction, we also received strong support from the city's Party and government leaders, who invested another 130,000 yuan. We used this sum, which was only one-tenth of the investment amount, on construction projects that had to be funded. The second difficulty was the raw materials barrier. Various steel materials and pipes alone required more than 100 tons, and the piping alone required more than 3,500 meters in length. We launched a "digging for gold and donating treasures" campaign. The factory's waste materials and the city's waste product collection stations became our "treasure mountains" for finding materials. At the same time, fraternal oil factories in Dalian, Huadian, and Jiaohe also gave us strong support. Not to mention the various fraternal units in the city, even the iron plates and iron pipes on the stairs of the movie theater were taken to be used according to their size. In addition, we made full use of old equipment, welding together two large oil tanks to make a mixed oil tank, and using old oil storage pits to make benzene storage, saving steel plates. We made 39 pulley wheels out of wood. In the entire equipment manufacturing process, only 18 tons of good steel were used, and the rest was solved by digging, finding, saving, profiting, and substituting. In this way, we broke through the raw materials and equipment barriers step by step. The third difficulty was the technical barrier. We adopted the method of "inviting in and sending out" to "learn and explore for treasure" to solve it. We invited master craftsmen and technicians from other factories to the factory to impart their valuable technical experience to us; we sent people to visit and learn from fraternal factories, bringing back the experience. Because we insisted on learning as we did, doing as we learned, and doing as we spoke, we replaced machines with saws, files, and drills, and replaced rolling machines with sledgehammers, resulting in the continuous production of eight large leaching tanks with a diameter of 1.9 meters and a height of 1.8 meters. Later, we continued to use this method to create filtering tanks, evaporation tanks, and more than 300 pairs of flanges and other equipment. By doing it ourselves, the oil extraction workers became mechanical workers, and learned a new set of skills. This not only created good conditions for better mastering technology and repairing machines in the future, but also transformed outsiders into insiders. After the difficulties were broken through layer by layer, on July 1, 1959, the Party's birthday, the leaching oil workshop was finally officially put into production. Since then, eight leaching tanks and some pipelines have replaced one hundred manual screw presses, and various gate switches have replaced the oil lever. In the past, one had to push the lever in a temperature of forty degrees Celsius, shouting slogans, and operating with sweat all over the face. Now, one works in a workshop with a suitable temperature, wearing clean work clothes, looking at instruments, switching gates, and inspecting machines, working leisurely and freely. The heavy manual operation that has been circulating for many years, "the strong do it, the old watch, the men do it, the women can't watch," is gone forever. The mechanization that the oil extraction workers have dreamed of for many years has been realized. Therefore, the workers unanimously praised:

    Entering the workshop is bright and bright, from then on throwing away carrying,
    Softening does not require going to the heated kang, oil extraction no longer pushes the iron lever,
    Mastering the time looking at the instruments, once the steam valve is opened, the oil flows fiercely,
    The temperature is suitable, the spirit is refreshed, working happily,
    Many years of wish finally realized, happiness all depends on the Communist Party.

At the beginning of this year, we again broke through the five major barriers of power source, steam source, soybean moisture, safety, and benzene consumption in production, achieving a good start and monthly red results in production. In January, we completed the plan thirteen days ahead of schedule, and in February, we completed the plan five days ahead of schedule. The average total output for the two months increased by 25.3%. In the technical revolution movement, we also realized mechanization of soil grain screening, truck transportation, changing one hole to multiple holes for oil filling, and mechanizing oil foot transportation.

The example of our workshop's realization of mechanization proves that the Party's proposal to vigorously carry out technical revolution is indeed the most important means to continuously develop productivity and ensure the thorough liberation of the working class from backward production methods. As long as we can listen to the Party's words everywhere, have soaring revolutionary drive, and consult with the masses more often, any difficulties can be broken through, and victory will belong to us.

In order to conscientiously implement the great call of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee to march towards "five transformations, double turnovers, and three improvements," all the workers in our workshop cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. Instead, we must hold high the red banner of technical revolution on the basis of initial victory, make a great advance towards the five transformations, double turnovers, and three improvements, set great ambitions, establish great aspirations, and make a great effort this year. We must fully mechanize and continuously produce the two ends of the leaching workshop within the first half of the year, in order to ensure the realization of the plan to increase oil production by 900,000 kilograms for the country this year.

Our preliminary plan is: in order to complete the combat mission of full mechanization of leaching and realize the continuous production line, we must first actively learn from the advanced experience of various fraternal factories, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, with the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to do, make a great technical revolution, and before "July 1," change the current manual loading and unloading of meal to mechanical loading and air transportation of meal. And realize the network of special line transportation vehicles, install dust collectors for screening, and install peeling machines for cockleburs, sunflowers, and wild plants. Make the degree of mechanization reach more than 95%. Through the method of the mother hen hatching eggs, realize one factory becoming three factories, and double the output value, and continue to move towards the grand goal of high, large, precise, sharp, and new. At the same time, we must also actively trial-produce and produce new varieties, and vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization, to achieve the requirements of multi-use of one material and making the best use of everything. Use soybean meal to manufacture casein and monosodium glutamate, and then use the remaining dregs to make pig feed. Therefore, it is determined to build one workshop each with an annual output of 600 tons of casein and an annual output of 100 tons of monosodium glutamate before the fourth quarter. Fully utilize oil feet to make phospholipids, belt oil, and soap, and use sunflower stalks, sunflower skins, corn stalks, and soybean stalks to make furfural and alcohol, etc. In order to march towards science, we also plan to implement "industry and agriculture side by side" in our factory, first establishing an experimental farm for superior agricultural varieties, transforming wild plants, and researching to increase the oil content of raw materials.

In order to realize the above plan, we will actively implement the instructions and resolutions of the provincial and municipal Party committees. Under the direct leadership of the factory Party committee, the workshop branch secretary will personally take charge and comprehensively launch the technical revolution movement. Clearly divide the work, with special personnel responsible for each reform, dividing the work and contracting it to the end. At the same time, we must mobilize workers to manufacture various machines and equipment themselves, mainly relying on self-reliance and starting from scratch, not relying on waiting for support and reaching out for money. We will do our best to help and support other fraternal factories to transform benzene oil extraction into mechanized production, so that our class brothers can be liberated from heavy physical labor as soon as possible and jointly step into the great new era of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation.

I wish the conference success and all delegates good health.

    自力更生，实现榨油生产全部机械化
    李川江代表谈榨油生产技术革新主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，并在今后实际工作中认真贯彻执行。现在我把四平油酒厂制油车间实现机械化的过程向领　导和代表们作一简单汇报。
    1959年，我们车间和全国各兄弟工厂车间一样，在1958年大跃进的基础上取得了新的成绩。全车间职工在党的正确领导下，通过大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，克服了种种困难，经过九个月的艰苦奋战，实现了油工们的愿望，把苯榨制油变成了浸出机械化生产。油的质量达到一等标准。日处理量由三十七吨提高到一百二十吨，出油效率由77.94％，提高到92.52％。全车间生产工人比过去减少了四分之三，日产量比过去增加三倍还多。每百斤大豆比苯榨多出油三、四斤，全年按十个月计算可多生产油九十万公斤，等于节省六千吨大豆，而且成本也大大降低，每吨豆油的实际成本比过去降低24.38％。通过这场革命，彻底的改变了车间的生产面貌。
    大家知道，我国百余年来用人力螺旋榨油的历史，在旧社会由于榨油的劳动条件恶劣，体力劳动强度大，不少榨油工人失去了幸福的晚年，有的工人变成残废。解放后由于党和政府的重视和关怀，在发展生产的同时，劳动保护条件也在逐年改善，但历史遗留下来的笨重体力手工操作的生产方式还没有根本改观，还需要在四十度高温中跟“油杠子”打交道。大跃进以来，厂党总支向我们提出了“榨油扔掉大油杠，实现机械化生产”的战斗目标，从此我们车间工人便立下了雄心大志，坚决响应党的号召。
    由于工人们都身受其累，深知其害，油工们在过去流传着这样一段歌谣：
    灰尘满屋飘，软化抗抬挑，
    炕?翻又扬，蒸锅热气烤，
    抬盘来回跑，拢垛弯着腰，
    推杠累死人，扒饼烫手脚，
    操作汗如雨，经常受感冒。
                      （油工职业病）
    这样一来，年龄未到人先老。所以油工们要求从笨重的体力劳动中早日解放出来的心情是迫不及待的。但是也有个别人对党总支提出的“自力更生，因陋就简，土洋结合，实现机械化”的奋斗方向，表示怀疑，他们说：“一无资金，二无设备，连个懂行的都没有，光靠几个油匠就能搞浸出机械化？闹不好，恐怕把先进车间的光荣称号也会闹丢了。”参观过旅大浸出厂的同志也耽心的说：“浸出生产可不简单，罐成林，管成网，咱们可搞不了，即或搞成也掌握不了，搞不好还要出危险。”党总支针对这种思想情况，及时组织群众开展了鸣放辩论，批判了这种满足于现状的右倾保守思想，回击了这股逆流，增强并鼓舞了职工实现机械化的信心。于是在开始改建中就把油桩子全部拔掉了。正在干得热火朝天的时候，原定在本市各机械厂加工的设备任务，由于一时加工不出来，本厂群众又未全面发动，延缓了上马时间，因此又有人产生了动摇，他们的表现，以前是前怕狼，现在又有点后怕虎，连厂长也感到心里没底，在这紧要关头，党总支又响亮的提出了：“冲破千万难，坚决搞到底”的决心。于是发动全厂职工提办法，用革命精神，开始向困难宣战。
    我们都遇到了哪些难关呢？第一关是资金关。制造一套完整的浸出设备，按全部价值计算，需要投资三百万元，这么大的数目，向上级要钱是不行的，于是我们首先同粮食部门协商，采用预付贷款的办法预借了十六万元，将来用提高出油率来补还。在改建过程中，又得到了市党政领导的大力支持，又投资了十三万元，就用这笔只相当于投资额十分之一的资金，我们把它用在非花钱不可的筹建项目上。第二关是原料关。仅各种钢材和管材就需要一百多吨，光是管道一项就需要三千五百多米长，我们就开展了挖金献宝运动，厂内的废料和市内的废品收购站，成了我们寻找材料的“万宝山”；同时，旅大、桦甸、蛟河等兄弟油厂也给我们大力支援，本市各兄弟单位就更不用说，连电影院楼梯上的铁板和铁管都拿来量材使用上了。另外还充分利用了旧有设备，把两个大油箱焊接起来做成混合油罐，用旧油囤做苯库，节约了钢板，用木头做了三十九个皮带轮。全部设备制造过程，只用了十八吨好钢材，其余都是靠挖、找、节、利、代的办法解决的。就这样一步步地突破了原材料和设备的难关。第三关是技术关。我们采用了请进来，派出去的
  “取经探宝”的办法来解决的。把外厂的老师傅和技术人员请到厂里来传授给我们宝贵的技术经验；派人到各兄弟厂去参观学习，取经回来。由于我们坚持干啥学啥，边学边干，说干就干，用锯、锉、钻代替机器，用大锤代替滚元机，结果连续制成了直径一米九粗，高一米八的八个浸出大罐，以后又继续用这种办法造成了过滤罐、蒸发罐和三百多副法兰盘等设备。这样亲自动手一干，榨油工人变成了机械工人，又多学了一套新本事，不但为今后更好地掌握技术和修理机器创造了良好条件，而且也由外行变成了内行。难关被层层突破以后，在1959年7月1日党的生日那天，浸出油车间终于正式投入生产了。从此八个浸出罐和一些管道代替了一百台人力笨榨，各种闸门开关代替了油杠子。过去是在四十度高温中推着杠子，边喊号，汗流满面地操作，现在是在温度适宜的车间里，穿着整洁的工作服，看看仪表，开关闸门，检查机器，轻闲自在的工作，流传多年的“壮年干，老年看，男人干，女人不能看”的笨重体力操作一去不复返了，榨油工人们多年梦想以求的机械化实现了。因此工人们一致赞扬的说：
    一进车间亮又亮，从此抛开挑抬扛，
    软化不用上火炕，榨油不再推铁杠，
    掌握时间看仪表，一开汽门油猛淌，
    温度适宜精神爽，干起活来喜洋洋，
    多年愿望终实现，幸福全靠共产党。
    今年年初，我们又在生产中突破了九源、汽源、大豆水分、安全和苯耗五大关，取得了生产开门红、月月红，一月份提前十三天完成计划，2月份提前五天完成计划，两个月的平均总产量增长25.3％。在技术革命运动中我们又实现了土粮筛选机械化，运输车子化，灌油一孔变多孔，输送油脚机械化。
    通过我们车间实现机械化的事例证明，党提出的大搞技术革命，确是不断发展生产力，是保证彻底解放工人阶级摆脱落后生产方式的最重要的手段，只要我们能够处处听党的话，有冲天的革命干劲，遇事多和群众商量，任何难关都会被突破，胜利就会属于我们的。
    为了认真地贯彻和执行中共吉林省委提出的向“五化、双翻、三提高”进军的伟大号召，我们车间全体职工，不能满足现有的成绩，而要在初战获胜的基础上高举技术革命的红旗，向五化、双翻、三提高大进军，立大志，树雄心，要在今年大干一场，使浸出车间的两头部分，设备在上半年内全部实现机械化、连续化生产，以保证实现今年为国家增产油脂九十万公斤的计划而奋斗。
    我们的初步规划是：为了完成浸出全部机械化，实现生产连续线的战斗任务，首先要积极学习各兄弟厂的先进经验，充分发挥群众智慧，以敢想敢干的共产主义精神，大闹技术革命，要在“七一”前把现在用手工操作的上料出粕改为上料机械化，出粕风送化。并实现专线运输车网化，筛选安装吸尘机，苍耳子、葵花及野生植物安装扒皮机。使机械化程度达到95％以上。通过母鸡抱窝的方法，实现一厂变三厂，产值翻两番，继续向高、大、精、尖、新的宏伟目标迈进。与此同时还要积极试制和生产新品种，大搞综合利用。达到一料多用，物尽其能的要求。用豆粕制造干酪素、味素，再用下来的?子制成猪饲料，因此确定在四季度前建成年产六百吨酪素、年产一百吨味素车间各一所。充分利用油脚制磷脂、皮带油和肥皂，用葵花秸、葵花皮、玉米棒子、豆秸豆夹做糠醛、酒精等。为了向科学进军，我们还准备在我厂实行“工农业并举”首先建立一所农业上的优良品种实验场，改造野生植物，研究提高原料含油量。
    为实现上述规划，积极贯彻执行省、市委的指示决议，在厂党总支的直接领导下，由车间支部书记亲自挂帅，全面开展技术革命运动。明确分工，各项改革都有专人负责，分工包干，一搞到底，同时要发动工人自己动手制造各种机器设备，主要靠自力更生、白手起家，不是靠等待支援，伸手要钱。我们要尽最大努力，通过各种办法，帮助和支援其他兄弟厂变苯榨制油为机械化生产，以便使自己的阶级弟兄，从笨重的体力劳动中，早日解放出来，共同跨进机械化、半机械化、自动化的伟大的新时代。
      祝大会成功，全体代表身体健康。
