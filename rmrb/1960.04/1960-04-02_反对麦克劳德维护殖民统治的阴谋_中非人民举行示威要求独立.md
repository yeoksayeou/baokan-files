    Opposing McLeod's Conspiracy to Maintain Colonial Rule
    Central African People Hold Demonstrations Demanding Independence
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) British colonialists have recently intensified their conspiratorial activities in the "Central African Federation." Following the activities of British Prime Minister Macmillan and the "Monckton Commission" headed by British Conservative Member of Parliament Monckton in Central Africa, British Colonial Secretary McLeod arrived in Central Africa on March 24 for a two-week visit.
    The purpose of McLeod's trip was to attempt to ease the struggle of the Central African people to break free from the "Central African Federation" imposed on them and to fight for independence through deceptive "constitutional reforms," in order to continue to maintain British colonial rule there. However, wherever McLeod went, he was met with large-scale demonstrations by Africans.
    When McLeod flew from Southern Rhodesia to the airport in Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia, on the 27th, thousands of Africans, ignoring the barbaric beatings of the police, broke through the cordon and surrounded the British Colonial Secretary's car. The demonstrators pounded on the body of McLeod's car with their fists, and the cars of other colonial officials were attacked with stones. Finally, under the protection and escort of a large number of mounted police, McLeod broke out of the encirclement.
    The "Central African Federation" includes Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesia, and Northern Rhodesia in the Central African region, covering an area of more than 1,265,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 8 million, most of whom are Africans. The purpose of the British colonialists in piecing together the "Central African Federation" was to strengthen the suppression of the increasingly awakened African people, maintain its colonial rule in the Central African region, and at the same time attempt to further combine Nyasaland's cheap labor with the mineral resources of Southern and Northern Rhodesia to form an economic unit that would be convenient for British monopoly capital to plunder and exploit.
    In order to demand withdrawal from and cancellation of the "Central African Federation," the Central African people have waged persistent struggles against the British colonialists for a long time. Strikes, demonstrations, and riots frequently broke out in various places. Recently, the struggle of the Central African people has developed vigorously.
    In order to save its increasingly shaky colonial rule, Britain has continued to adopt violent suppression measures, carrying out large-scale arrests and killings of the Central African people. At the same time, it has also played political deception, using so-called "constitutional reforms" and superficially concessionary gestures such as increasing the number of African parliamentarians to ease the anti-colonial struggle of the Central African people. However, even if the likes of Macmillan and McLeod attempt to paint colonialism with a charming color, they still cannot hide the essence of colonial rule.
    McLeod's encounter during this trip to Central Africa shows that the Central African people have seen through these tricks of the British colonialists. They demand that the "Federation" be dissolved immediately, that Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia be granted independence immediately, and that the people of Southern Rhodesia enjoy freedom and equal rights. This demand is irresistible. No matter how fierce and cunning the British colonial rulers are, they cannot save the final collapse of their colonial rule.

### 反对麦克劳德维护殖民统治的阴谋  中非人民举行示威要求独立

    反对麦克劳德维护殖民统治的阴谋
    中非人民举行示威要求独立
    本报讯　英国殖民者最近加紧在“中非联邦”进行阴谋活动。在英国首相麦克米伦和以英国保守党议员蒙克顿为首的“蒙克顿委员会”去中非活动之后，英国殖民大臣麦克劳德又在3月24日到达中非进行为期两周的活动。
    麦克劳德此行的目的是企图通过欺骗性的“宪法改革”来缓和中非人民要求摆脱强加在他们身上的“中非联邦”和争取独立的斗争，以便继续维持英国在那里的殖民统治。但是，麦克劳德所到之处，都遇到了非洲人的大规模示威。
    当麦克劳德27日从南罗得西亚乘飞机到北罗得西亚首府卢萨卡的机场时，数千名非洲人不顾警察的野蛮殴打，冲破警戒线，把英国殖民大臣的汽车包围起来。示威群众用拳头敲打麦克劳德的汽车的车身，其他殖民官员的汽车受到了石头的袭击。最后，在大批骑警的保护和开道下，麦克劳德才冲出重围。
    “中非联邦”包括非洲中部地区的尼亚萨兰、南罗得西亚和北罗得西亚，面积共一百二十六万五千多平方公里，人口约八百多万，其中绝大部分是非洲人。英国殖民者拼凑“中非联邦”的目的，是为了加强镇压日益觉醒的非洲人民，维持它在中非地区的殖民统治地位，同时企图把尼亚萨兰的廉价劳动力同南、北罗得西亚的矿藏进一步结合起来，凑成一个便于英国垄断资本掠夺榨取的经济单位。
    中非人民为了要求退出和取消“中非联邦”，长期以来对英国殖民者进行了坚持不懈的斗争。各地经常爆发罢工、示威和暴动。最近，中非人民的斗争更有了蓬勃的发展。
    为了挽救日益动摇的殖民统治地位，英国一方面继续采取暴力镇压的手段，对中非人民进行了大规模的逮捕和屠杀，同时，又玩弄政治欺骗手法，以所谓“宪法改革”、增设非洲人议员名额等表面上的让步姿态，来缓和中非人民的反殖民主义斗争。但是，即使麦克米伦和麦克劳德之流企图给殖民主义涂上一层迷人的色彩，也仍然掩盖不了殖民统治的实质。
    麦克劳德此次中非之行的遭遇说明，中非人民已经识破了英国殖民者的这些手法，他们要求立即解散这个“联邦”，立即让尼亚萨兰和北罗得西亚独立，并使南罗得西亚人民享有自由平等的权利。这种要求是不可抗拒的。英国殖民统治者不管多么凶恶和狡猾，也挽救不了它的殖民统治的最后崩溃。
