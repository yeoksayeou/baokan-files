Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. While studying and discussing these reports, the glorious achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and the beautiful prospects of approaching communism are displayed before my eyes, which is very inspiring. I have received a profound education in Marxism-Leninism's universal truth combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong Thought. I have realized the truth that political and economic relations are inseparable in socialist construction, and further recognized the unparalleled correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. This has once again made me realize that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no victory in socialist construction.

During the two conferences from 1959 to 1960, I visited the Northeast and Central South regions of our country. What I saw in these two regions, whether in terms of industrial and agricultural construction or cultural and educational construction, was nothing short of a rapid advance with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping and a thousand miles a day, rapidly changing the backward and poor face of the country in the past. The facts are endless; it is worth pointing out that the Northeast was originally a mess left over by Japanese imperialism, and it took many years to clean up the mess. Hubei Province suffered a major drought last year that had not been seen in a century, and the conditions were not so favorable. However, under the leadership of the Party, all difficulties were overcome, and bad things turned into good things.

At present, with the highly conscious and liberated people of the whole country, under the education of the Communist Party, every corner and every aspect of our great motherland is working selflessly to carry out socialist construction, and the achievements are nationwide. Figures prove that our total industrial and agricultural output value has increased by 4.3 times compared with 1949. The proportion of industrial and agricultural output value has developed to nearly 70 to 30 by 1959. That is to say, in just ten short years, our country has quickly transformed from a backward agricultural country in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. This is a great event that the Chinese people have dreamed of for a hundred years, a miracle that has never been seen in ancient or modern history!

This is a great victory for the Chinese people, a victory for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a victory for Marxism-Leninism, a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, an achievement made by countless outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people and Communist Party members through sacrifice and struggle, and it is also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great socialist brother countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Glory belongs to the great Communist Party, glory belongs to the great Chairman Mao, glory belongs to the great proletarian internationalism!

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party, with the rapid development of productive forces, constant changes have taken place in production relations. Each change in production relations has further liberated productive forces. This change in production relations is sharp and complex in terms of class struggle, and the achievements are also huge. However, it should be said that only after the rectification and anti-rightist movement in 1957 achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, basically resolving the issue of who wins and who loses in the struggle between the two lines, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes were rapidly realized on the basis of this victory, and the socialist construction cause could be carried out smoothly. This shows how inseparable the political and ideological struggle is from the economic struggle in the arduous process of building a socialist country, how significant it is, and people have received a vivid class education in this struggle. I have a particularly deep feeling about this.

As everyone knows, I have committed serious political errors. Thanks to the Party's care and education, I was rescued, and I am sincerely grateful. The great victories of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes in the past two years have encouraged me and educated me, so that I finally could not but be convinced by objective truth. Precisely because of this, I cannot but thoroughly correct my mistakes, and cannot but abandon my stubborn bourgeois position and begin to move closer to the Party.

In a period after the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, I still had such a problem in my thinking. I thought to myself that I had been influenced and educated by the Party for a long time before and after liberation. If I said that I had no feelings for the Party, or that I was determined to oppose the Party to the death, I could not agree with it ideologically. However, I later carefully examined why I finally went to the completely opposite side of the Party. In addition to class roots and historical roots, I was looking at the Party and the new country with a pair of gray glasses. I always thought that it would be very difficult for the Communist Party to manage and build our country, which was riddled with holes and extremely poor and backward, and even if it could be managed and built, it would belong to the distant future, not something that could be realized in a short period of time. Because of my own short-sightedness, I lacked confidence in the Party and the country. Therefore, what I said in the past about supporting the Party and supporting socialism could not but be empty talk when it came to practice. The problem is that I was standing on the bourgeois position, using the bourgeois point of view and methods, and using the bourgeois decadent set of political experience to look at new things. I was prejudiced and limited, so I could never grasp the truth, never understand the objective laws of historical development, and never recognize the Communist Party or believe in the Communist Party. In this way, from doubting the Party to opposing the Party, it became a logically inevitable conclusion.

In the past two years, under the care and education of the Party and the help of comrades, and under the education of the Great Leap Forward situation, if I have made a little progress, it is that I have finally realized that the Chinese Communist Party is the party that truly represents the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese working people, that Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people, and that supporting the Party and supporting Chairman Mao is supporting the interests of the people, is the truth, is the power, and will lead to victory; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to failure and destruction.

The truth is clear. This is linked to the issue of political stance, which is the key issue of transformation. I believe that all those who have committed political errors should learn a lesson from it.

The great Party's care and concern for me encourages me to study and transform with a hundred times the courage. In the practice of visiting, countless examples have educated me. Faced with the huge progress of the country, it is impossible to describe it in words. The lives of the people have also been greatly improved. Everyone has unlimited confidence in the beautiful prospects and is pursuing a more ideal life. The iron facts show that the Party's leadership is combined with the mass movement, and that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated the hearts of the people and grasped the masses. "Once the theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes a material force." Therefore, the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are raised high among the people. Under the guidance of political leadership, relying on the masses, and a complete set of two-legged walking policies, the great Chinese working class, with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, is currently launching a high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution through the three combinations and the learning, comparison, catching up, and helping competition and communist collaboration. The people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act have endless wisdom and strength, which not only makes it possible to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, but also provides a reliable guarantee for continuous leap forward in the future. The tested Chinese people have unparalleled confidence in the great cause of building their own prosperous and strong socialist country, which cannot be shaken by any difficulties. Our country will continue to create miracles. In the era of Mao Zedong, miracles will continue to appear. There is no doubt that all those who adhere to the bourgeois position, point of view, and methods of looking at problems will still be panicked in the face of the facts. However, it should be seen that there are two types of people among them: one is imperialism and reactionaries, who are our mortal enemies, and we can only persist in the struggle against them; the other is those who consider themselves to be well-intentioned, who are still holding a hesitant or distrustful mood, doubting this, doubting that, complaining about this, complaining about that, and unable to find a way out of their thinking. It must be reminded that they should broaden their horizons, recognize the situation, make up their minds, and carry out self-transformation, first of all, the transformation of their political stance. If the position changes, the ideological feelings will also change accordingly, and it will naturally be more correct to look at problems and deal with problems, so as to achieve a thorough awakening, honesty, recognize mistakes, and correct mistakes. This is the starting point for mastering one's own destiny, and it is also the beginning of turning negative factors into positive factors, which the Party and the people have always welcomed.

For me personally, I realize that today, the infinite wisdom and strength of the 650 million Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership and organization of the Communist Party, has become a torrent in the 1960s to transform the human world and the natural world, which cannot be stopped by any force. People have already put forward the bold slogan of "transforming the earth." What ambition and grand spirit is this! Anyone who loves the motherland should be encouraged by this and greet the arrival of this torrent with full enthusiasm, and plunge into the torrent. All ideas of personal gain and loss of fame and fortune are dirty things left over from bourgeois society, which are not worth worrying about and nostalgic for, and cannot be worried about or nostalgic for. Let us use this earth-shaking torrent to ruthlessly bury those dirty things, if we do not want to be buried by the torrent.

The era is great, I am determined to keep up with it, and I am also determined to continue to transform myself. First of all, I must work hard to study Mao Zedong Thought. Through this study, I demand to be a good and docile tool of the Party. In the past, I did not understand this sentence, and of course I was unwilling to say it. Now I understand that being a docile tool of the Party means unconditionally being a servant of the people, which is glorious, should be, and should be said loudly. However, this is by no means an easy task, and it must be achieved through continuous learning and transformation. I sincerely request all committee members to give criticism and guidance.

### 大彻大悟　老老实实　认识错误　改正错误  黄琪翔委员的发言

    大彻大悟　老老实实　认识错误　改正错误
    黄琪翔委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。在学习和讨论这些报告中，在我的眼前展现了祖国社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就和即将到来的共产主义的美丽远景，精神十分感奋。我受到了一次深刻的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的教育，体会到在社会主义建设中政治和经济关系不可分的真理，进一步认识了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的无比正确性。从而又一次体会到没有共产党的领导，就没有社会主义建设的胜利。
    在1959年到1960年这两次大会期间，我先后参观了我国东北地区和中南地区。我所看到的这两个地区，无论在工农业建设方面和文化教育建设方面都莫不以万马奔腾、一日千里的姿态飞跃地前进，迅速地改变了国家过去落后贫穷的面貌。事实是说不完的；值得指出的，东北原是日本帝国主义遗留下来的烂摊子，在清理打扫烂摊子当中还费了不少的岁月，而湖北省在去年则遭受了百年未曾有过的大旱灾，条件都并不是那么优越的，可是，在党的领导下，克服了一切困难，坏事变成了好事。
    当前，有了高度觉悟的解放了的全国人民在共产党的教育下，在我们伟大的祖国土地上面，任何一个角落，任何一个方面，都在忘我地劳动着，进行社会主义的建设，成就是全国性的。数字证明：我们的工农业生产总值比1949年增加了四点三倍，其中工业和农业产值的比例，到1959年已发展到接近七十比三十。这就是说，我国在短短的十年中已经由半封建半殖民地的落后的农业国快要变成为有现代工业，现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义的强国了。这是百年来中国人民梦寐以求的大好事，是古今中外历史上所不曾有过的奇迹！
    这是中国人民伟大的胜利，是中国共产党领导的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无数中国人民优秀的儿女、共产党员牺牲奋斗所取得的业绩，同时也是和以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义兄弟国家的无私援助分不开的。
    光荣属于伟大的共产党，光荣属于伟大的毛主席，光荣属于伟大的无产阶级国际主义！
    解放以来，在党的英明领导下，随着生产力的飞速发展，生产关系方面发生过不断的变革，生产关系每一次的变革，又进一步地解放了生产力。这个生产关系的变革体现在阶级斗争方面是尖锐的，复杂的，而成绩也是巨大的；但是，应该说，直至通过了1957年的整风反右，在政治战线上和思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利以后，基本上解决了两条路线斗争中谁胜谁负的问题，总路线、大跃进、人民公社才在这个胜利的基础上迅速实现，社会主义建设事业才得以顺利进行，这就说明了在建设一个社会主义国家的艰苦过程中政治思想斗争与经济斗争是如何地血肉不可分离，意义是何等重大，人们在这个斗争中受到了活生生的阶级教育，我对此感受特别深刻。
    大家知道，我是在政治上犯过严重的错误的。由于党的关怀、教育，把我挽救过来，我衷心感激。这两年来总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利整个形势鼓舞了我，教育了我，使我终于不能不为客观真理所折服。正因为如此，我不能不痛改前非，不能不放弃我那顽固的资产阶级立场而开始靠拢党。
    在1957年反右派斗争以后的一个时期，我在思想上还存在这样的问题，自以为我在解放前后是长期受过党的影响和教育的，若说我对党毫无感情，或是誓死反对党，思想上是不能同意的。可是以后我又仔细检查：为什么我终于走上和党根本对立的方面呢？除了阶级根源、历史根源之外，我是带着一副灰色的眼镜来看待党、看待新国家的。我总以为共产党要把我国千疮百孔、极端贫困落后的这个废墟治理好、建设好，困难重重；纵使能够治理好、建设好，也是属于遥远的未来，而不是短时期所能实现。由于自己的目光短浅，对党对国家就缺乏信心，因此，以往我口头所说的拥护党，拥护社会主义，一接触到实际，就不可能不是一种空谈。问题是我站在资产阶级立场上，用资产阶级的观点和方法、用资产阶级腐朽的一套政治经验来看新事物，有偏见，有局限，这样就永远不能掌握真理，永远不能认识历史发展的客观规律，也就永远不会认识共产党，相信共产党。这样，由怀疑党到反对党，也就成为逻辑上必然的结论。
    两年来在党的关怀教育和同志们的帮助下，在大跃进的形势教育下，如果说我还有点滴进步的话，那就是我终于认识到：中国共产党是真正代表中国广大劳动人民利益的党，毛主席是中国人民的救星，拥护党，拥护毛主席，就是拥护人民利益，就是真理，就是力量，就会胜利；反之，就必然趋于失败，必然走向灭亡。
    道理是明白的。这里就连系到政治立场问题，也就是改造的关键性问题。我认为一切犯过政治错误的人，都应该从中接受教训。
    伟大的党对我的关怀和照顾，鼓舞着我勇气百倍地学习和改造。在参观实践中，无数的事例教育了我，面对着国家巨大的进步事实，是无法能用言语来形容的，人民群众的生活也大大的改善了，每一个人对于美好的远景都抱有无限的信心，并在追求着更美好的理想生活。铁的事实，说明了党的领导和群众运动结合在一起，说明了战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经深入了人心，掌握了群众。“理论一经掌握了群众，就变成为物质的力量”。因此，总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗便在人民群众中高高举起。在政治挂帅、依靠群众和一整套两条腿走路的方针指引下，伟大的中国工人阶级以苦干、实干加巧干的精神，通过三结合与学、比、赶、帮的评比竞赛和共产主义大协作，目前正掀起了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动高潮。敢想、敢说、敢干的人民群众有无穷无尽的智慧和力量，这就不仅使多快好省地建设社会主义成为可能，而且是今后长期持续跃进的可靠保证。久经考验的中国人民对于建成自己的富强繁荣的社会主义国家的伟大事业抱有无比的信心，是任何困难所动摇不了的。我们的国家将不断创造奇迹。在毛泽东的时代，奇迹是会不断出现的，一切坚持资产阶级立场、观点和方法看问题的人，还会在事实面前惊慌失措，这是毫无疑问的。但是，应该看到，他们中间包括有两种人：一种是帝国主义和反动派，是我们的死敌，我们只有对他们坚持斗争；另一种是自许所谓好心好意的人，他们也还在怀着徬徨或不信任的心情，怀疑这，怀疑那，埋怨这，埋怨那，思想找不到出路。必须提醒他们，要放宽眼界，认清形势，立下决心，实行自我改造，首先是政治立场改造。立场转变了，思想感情也就随之改变，看问题、对待问题自然也会比较正确，从而大彻大悟，老老实实，认识错误，改正错误。这是掌握自己命运的起点，也是变消极因素为积极因素的开端，党和人民一向是对此表示欢迎的。
    对我个人来说，我认识到今天六亿五千万中国人民的无穷无尽的智慧和力量，在毛泽东思想的指导和共产党的领导组织下，已经成为二十世纪六十年代改造人类世界和自然面貌的洪流，是任何力量所阻挡不住的。人们已经提出了豪迈的口号，在“改造地球”。这是何等雄心大志和宏伟气魄！任何热爱祖国的人都应该为此欢欣鼓舞，以满腔热情迎接这股洪流的到来，并且投入洪流中去。一切属于个人主义的名位利害得失念头，都是资产阶级社会残存下来的脏东西，不值得计较和留恋，而且也计较不了，留恋不住。让我们利用这翻天复地的洪流无情地把那些脏东西埋葬掉罢，如果我们不愿意被洪流所埋葬的话。
    时代是伟大的，我有决心要跟上去，也有决心要继续改造自己。首先我要努力学习毛泽东思想，通过这个学习，要求做好党的驯服工具。这句话，在过去我是不理解的，当然也不肯说的。现在我理解到做党的驯服工具，就是无条件地做人民的勤务员，是光荣的，是应该的，是说得响亮的。但是，这也决不是轻而易举的事，必须通过不断的学习和改造，才能达到。我诚恳地请求各位委员给予批评和指教。
