Premier Zhou said that General Ne Win is a good friend of the Chinese people, and he recently visited China and signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Boundary Agreement in Beijing, and was therefore praised by Prime Minister U Nu.

He also said that when he was about to resign from the post of Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister U Nu agreed to his sending this invitation, for which he expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister U Nu.

General Ne Win said that his last visit to China coincided with the Chinese Spring Festival, when he saw the Chinese people celebrating their traditional festival. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma this time also coincided with the Burmese New Year, and the Burmese people are also celebrating their own festival. He believed that this was a good omen for the development and consolidation of Sino-Burmese friendship. He proposed a toast to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi, and to the success of Premier Zhou Enlai's work.

Premier Zhou Enlai then rose again and proposed a toast to the health of all the Burmese guests attending the banquet. He said that all the Burmese guests attending this banquet are friends of China, and they have either been to China or will be going to China later. Premier Zhou pointed out that mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries will help consolidate and develop the friendship between the two countries, promote mutual understanding, mutual learning, exchange of experiences and views, and help strengthen the lasting friendship between the descendants of the two peoples.
