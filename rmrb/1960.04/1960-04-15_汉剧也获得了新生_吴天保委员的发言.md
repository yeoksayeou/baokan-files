Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

I have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft. These two reports are about the Great Leap Forward, about a continued Great Leap Forward, and are also inspiring reports. I wholeheartedly support them and will bring this spirit back and resolutely implement it in my work.

When I toured with the troupe to Enshi, Huanggang, Xiaogan and other regions last year and this year, I saw with my own eyes that the rural cultural activities were doing very well. They are lively and dynamic in both content and form, closely aligned with the current central work in the countryside. As a professional, I should learn from their spirit. Because I haven't been to many places and haven't gone deep enough, I won't talk much about this aspect. Next, I would just like to talk about the Han Opera Troupe.

Han Opera is a local opera genre in Hubei with a history of over 300 years. It has a unique artistic style and rich artistic heritage, with a repertoire once said to include 800 plays. It was later introduced to Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Gansu. However, due to the devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries and the addiction to commercial malpractices, Han Opera was already declining rapidly, in a state of depression, and almost dying out before the demise of the Kuomintang government. Especially, the broad masses of artists were forced by reactionary forces and life, scattered in the countryside,沦乞为丐, with many deaths; the repertoire was reduced to just over 400 plays.

	Han Opera Achieves Brilliant Success After Rebirth

After the liberation of Hubei in 1949, Han Opera gained new life under the care and support of the Party and the People's Government, and a series of "reforming people, reforming systems, and reforming plays" movements were carried out. In order to concentrate leadership and rapidly develop and improve, the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe was formed in June 1953 by merging the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe No. 1, the Minzhong Orchestra, and the Xinsheng Troupe. Since the establishment of the troupe, under the direct leadership of the Party and the Cultural Bureau, and under the guidance of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" and "walking on two legs" policy, brilliant achievements have been made in excavating, sorting out, and carrying forward the traditions of Han Opera, and in using the traditions of drama to perform modern life and to praise the heroic figures of our time—the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Over the past decade, many excellent traditional plays have been excavated, sorted out, and staged, such as "Universe Upside Down," "Qin Xianglian," "Twice Blooming Plum," "Playing the Flower Drum," "Double Descent from the Mountain," and "Autumn River," all of which have achieved high artistic achievements. Among them, "Universe Upside Down" and "Twice Blooming Plum" were filmed in 1954 and 1959 respectively, spreading throughout the country and further expanding the influence of Han Opera. Thanks to the Party's wise and correct policies, modern plays that praised workers, peasants, and soldiers have also gradually taken root and shone on the Han Opera stage, opening up a new path for Han Opera. In the early days of liberation, the troupe performed "Nine Pieces of Clothing," "Red Maid," "Wild Boar Forest," "The White-Haired Girl," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "The Millennium Glacier Thawed," and "Execution of Zhou Sanmao" to coordinate with the Party's central tasks. After the great rectification campaign, under the guidance of the two-legged walking policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and due to the improvement of the political and ideological awareness of the masses, the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers were massively brought to the stage. For example, the self-written and self-performed "My Family" and "Wildfire, Spring Breeze Fights the Ancient City" creatively used the traditions of Han Opera, making the traditional Han Opera performance techniques and modern life well-coordinated. They were performed dozens or even more than a hundred times and were warmly welcomed by the audience, opening up a path for Han Opera to perform modern life, laying a foundation, and taking root. This is the victory of Han Opera, the victory of the Party's policies.

	Resolutely Implement the Policy of Literature and Art Serving Politics, Production, and Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Under the direct leadership of the Party, great achievements have also been made in resolutely implementing the policy of literature and art "serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" and in coordinating with the Party's central political movements, giving full play to the weapon role of literature and art in "educating the people and打击敌人". In 1953, our troupe participated in the慰问团 to North Korea to extend greetings to the most beloved Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. In 1954, during the great flood control struggle in Wuhan, while participating in the flood control struggle, we organized a慰问团 to conduct慰问 performances on the front lines, giving great encouragement to the flood control soldiers. Especially after the rectification campaign, the work of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the Party's central movements was elevated to the primary position. Since 1958, every year, a quarter or a third of our time has been spent上山下乡, 下工矿, 下部队 performing for the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Each performance team spends three or four months living in the countryside, delivering plays to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We have visited vast counties, cities, villages, and towns in Hubei, including Xiaogan, Yingshan, Dawu, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Qianjiang, Jiayu, Honghu, Xianning, Huanggang, Macheng, Daye, Echeng, Enshi, Badong, Laifeng, Jianshi, Xianfeng, Yichang, Lichuan, and even remote mountainous areas where "the sound of gongs and drums has not been heard for a thousand years, and plays have not been staged for ten thousand years" have left the footprints of our propaganda team. At the beginning of 1959, our troupe went to the Fujian front line to conduct慰问 performances for the soldiers guarding the border of the motherland for more than 40 days, fundamentally changing the situation of the troupe being nostalgic for the city and being detached and isolated from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Even when performing in the city, we try our best to arrange the theater in the industrial area, or consciously send good tickets to the door, invite workers and soldiers to our homes, and organize跃进场, etc. We realize that if dramatic art wants to flourish, it must take root and blossom in the soil of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

We closely noted the importance of drama cooperating with the Party's central movement, so that dramatic art fully exerted its combat role, making drama more full of vitality. Cooperating with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we performed "Blood Debt Must Be Paid"; cooperating with the Marriage Law propaganda, we performed "Little Son-in-Law" and "Little Erhei Gets Married"; cooperating with changing social customs and abolishing prostitution and养女制, we performed "The Millennium Glacier Thawed"; cooperating with the 抗美援朝, we performed "Hua Zhiying Annihilates the American Wolf" and "Oppose Bacteriological Warfare"; cooperating with the struggle between the two roads, we performed "Lei Dagu"; cooperating with technological innovation, we performed "Fierce Fire Red Heart"; cooperating with communist ideological education, we performed "My Family" and "Xiang Xiuli"; cooperating with opposing the US imperialist aggression against Lebanon, we performed "Eisenhower's True Colors Revealed"; when the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet rebelled, we performed "Princess Wencheng"; and cooperating with the socialist general line education movement, we performed "The People's Commune is Good," etc., all of which timely cooperated with the Party's central movement and played a great educational role for the masses.

	Cultivate a Batch of Successors Who Are Both Red and Expert

The Party and the government attach great importance to the cultivation of young people. Over the past decade, a large number of successors who are both red and expert have been cultivated for Han Opera. The troupe has cultivated 33 young actors, 10 musicians, 2 clothing personnel, 3 lighting personnel, and 2 stage art personnel with certain achievements by means of teachers bringing apprentices. In 1953, the Wuhan Municipal Drama School was established. After six years of cultivation, 62 students with high school education and a certain artistic accomplishment graduated in June 1959 and were assigned to work in the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe, strengthening the Han Opera team. In order to better inherit and carry forward the Party's Han Opera cause, the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe recruited 28 students in 1957 and established a training class. With the rapid development of the situation and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, another 30 students were recruited in 1958, and the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe Affiliated Drama School was established on the basis of the training class. The younger generation of Han Opera is thriving like bamboo shoots after rain.

	Artists Must Go上山下乡 to Continuously Strengthen Ideological Remolding

Over the past decade, the Party has also achieved great success in implementing the policy of unity, education, and remolding of intellectuals in the troupe, making the face of the literary and art team brand new. Many artists have been rescued by the Party and have gained new lives.

Our team basically belongs to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. Especially for those who are older and have lived in the old society for a long time, the old ideological consciousness is very strong. If we do not seize the time to carry out political and ideological education and strengthen ideological remolding, we will follow the old path of the bourgeoisie. Before the rectification campaign, due to the failure to correctly implement the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals, we only focused on unity and care, and relaxed education and remolding. As a result, bourgeois ideology continued to flood, and evil trends still existed. Labor discipline was lax, opposition to上山下乡 and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the idea of seeking ease and avoiding hard work were prevalent and serious. In the 1958大鸣大放 and向党交心, it was revealed that "the Communist Party is almost the same as the Kuomintang, neither annoying nor likable," "It doesn't matter whether the Communist Party or the Kuomintang comes, whoever gives me milk is my mother," and openly declared "If a person doesn't act for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him" and "Even if I don't leave a fragrant name for a hundred generations, I will leave a stink for ten thousand years," which fully demonstrated their serious bourgeois standpoint and views. Based on the above situation, the Party resolutely implemented the policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals in the troupe. In addition to strengthening regular political and ideological education to change their standpoint and views, the most important and only method is to strengthen labor training to remold their ideology and remold their class feelings. After the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, the Party's general branch in the troupe firmly grasped this link and vigorously organized actors to go上山下乡,下厂下部队, extensively and deeply perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers, combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and actively participate in labor training. Since 1958, the average person has gone上山下乡,下厂下部队 more than five times, and the longest time has been more than three months. Going down to factories, troops, and the countryside to perform, participate in labor training, and combine with labor models and heroic figures. This method is very effective and has greatly improved the comrades' thinking. After going down, they are not only actors, but also porters, cooks, service personnel, and stage art staff. From carrying water, cooking, washing clothes, mending clothes, shining shoes, checking tickets, matching numbers, sweeping the floor, carrying costumes and props to performing, a series of work is done by themselves. Those who used to hate labor now love labor; those who were not at ease with their work are now at ease with their work; those who disliked the dirtiness of workers and peasants now feel infinitely honored to be in contact with the masses of workers and peasants and to have the ideological feelings of workers and peasants; what used to be the work of several people is now done by one person, and done very well; what used to be unwilling to do is now being done by everyone… From being unwilling to go to the countryside to striving to go to the countryside; from disliking labor to loving labor, there has been a fundamental change in ideological feelings. They have understood the sweetness and bitterness of labor, the sweetness and bitterness of a grain of grain and a drop of sweat, and have realized the harmfulness of bourgeois individualism. Some comrades said: "Compared with the working class and peasant elder brothers, the work we do is too far behind, it's just a drop in the ocean!" Under the wise leadership of the Party, in the Party's regular and patient political and ideological education, in the上山下乡,下厂下部队 and contact with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and in the long-term and continuous labor training, we have remolded our ideological feelings and gained a new life.

In order to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in the national economy in 1960, under the shining of the Party's general line, under the guidance of the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, weeding through the old to bring forth the new, we must implement the working policy of overall planning, active development, focusing on key construction, and improving quality, so that Han Opera work can leap forward better and better serve socialist construction.

For us Han Opera workers, studying Mao Zedong Thought is of particular importance. We must seriously, persistently, and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds, constantly and thoroughly remold our bourgeois world outlook, and establish a proletarian world outlook, so that we can be promoters of the revolution and further contribute our strength to the construction and creation of socialist and communist culture and art. In the future, I guarantee to move forward along the road guided by the Party and actively contribute all my strength to the socialist cause.

### 汉剧也获得了新生  吴天保委员的发言

专栏：

    汉剧也获得了新生
    吴天保委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，这两个报告是跃进，是持续大跃进也是振奋人心的报告。我衷心拥护并且把这种精神带回去，在工作上坚决执行。
    我去年和今年随着剧团先后到过恩施、黄冈、孝感等专区巡回演出时，亲眼看到农村的文艺活动搞得很好，他们从内容到形式都是配合着当前农村的中心工作，因此，使我感到非常生动、活泼。作为一个专业的我，应该向他们这种精神学习。我因到的地方不多也不深入，所以在这一方面我不多谈了。下面我只想谈谈汉剧团的情况。
    汉剧，是一个具有三百多年历史的湖北地方剧种，它有着独特的艺术风格和丰富的艺术传统遗产，剧目曾号称八百出。后曾传入湖南、陕西、河南、江西、广西、安徽、福建、云南、四川、广东、甘肃等地。但由于国民党反动派的摧残，加上染上了商业化的恶习，在国民党的政府灭亡前夕，汉剧已经日趋没落、一蹶不振，几近于死亡，而尤其广大艺人为反动势力和生活所迫，四乡流散，沦乞为丐，死亡甚多；剧目只剩下四百多出。
        新生后的汉剧成就辉煌
    1949年湖北解放后，汉剧在党和人民政府的关怀扶植下，才获得新生，并进行了一系列的“改人、改制、改戏”运动。为了集中领导，迅速发展提高，于1953年6月武汉市的汉一团、民众乐团、新生剧团合并组成武汉市汉剧团。建团以来在党和文化局的直接领导下，党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”和“两条腿走路”方针的指导下，在挖掘、整理、发扬汉剧传统和运用戏剧传统表演现代生活歌颂当代的英雄人物——广大的工农兵群众方面都取得了辉煌的成就。十年来，挖掘、整理、上演了很多优秀的传统剧目，如“宇宙锋”、“秦香莲”、“二度梅”、“打花鼓”、“双下山”、“秋江”等都取得很高的艺术成就，其中“宇宙锋”、“二度梅”先后于1954年、1959年拍摄电影，遍及全国，更进一步的扩大了汉剧的影响。由于党的方针政策英明正确，歌颂工农兵的现代戏也逐渐在汉剧舞台上生根、发光，给汉剧开辟了一条新的道路。解放初期，配合党的中心演出了“九件衣”、“红娘子”、“野猪林”、“白毛女”、“王贵与李香香”、“血泪仇”、“千年冰河开了冻”、“枪毙周三毛”等。在伟大的整风运动以后，在党中央和毛主席制定的两条腿走路方针的指导下，由于群众政治思想觉悟的提高，将工农兵的英雄形象大量的搬上舞台，如自编自演的“我的一家”、“野火春风斗古城”等都创造性的运用了汉剧传统，使汉剧传统的表演手法和现代生活很好的配合了起来，演出数十场乃至一百多场，受到观众的热烈欢迎，为汉剧表演现代生活开辟了道路，奠定了基础，扎下了根子。这是汉剧的胜利，是党的方针政策的胜利。
    坚决贯彻文艺为政治、生产、工农兵服务的方针
    在党的直接领导下，在坚决贯彻文艺“为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务”的方针和配合党的政治中心运动方面也取得了很大的成绩，充分的发挥了文艺“教育人民，打击敌人”的武器作用。1953年我团参加了赴朝慰问团，对最可爱的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军进行了慰问；1954年在武汉伟大的防汛斗争中，一方面参加防汛斗争，一方面组织慰问团到前线进行慰问演出，给防汛战士很大的鼓舞。特别是整风运动以后，把为工农兵服务，为党的中心运动服务的工作，提到了首要的地位，从1958年起，每年都有四分之一或三分之一的时间上
  山下乡，下工矿、下部队为工农兵群众演出，每个演出队都有三个月或四个月的时间生活在农村里，给工农兵群众送戏。先后到过湖北的孝感、应山、大悟、沔阳、汉川、潜江、嘉鱼、洪湖、咸宁、黄冈、麻城、大冶、鄂城、恩施、巴东、来凤、建始、咸丰、宜昌、利川等广大县城、村镇，连“千年不闻锣鼓声、万年不见戏上台”的偏远大山区，也留下了我们这支宣传队的足迹。1959年初我团又赴福建前线，对保卫祖国边疆的战士进行了四十多天的慰问演出，根本改变了剧团留恋城市而与广大工农兵群众脱离、隔绝的状况。就是在城市里演出，我们也尽量的把剧场安排在工业区，或有意识的将好票送上门，将工人、战士请到家，组织跃进场等。我们认识到戏剧艺术要想获得繁荣滋长，就必须在广大工农兵群众的土壤中生根开花。
    我们密切的注意到戏剧配合党的中心运动的重要性，使戏剧艺术充分的发挥了它的战斗作用，使戏剧更加富于生命力。配合镇压反革命演出了“血债血还”，配合婚姻法宣传演出了“小女婿”“小二黑结婚”，配合改变社会风尚，废除妓女、养女制演出了“千年冰河开了冻”，配合抗美援朝演出了“华志英力歼美国狼”、“反对细菌战”，配合两条道路斗争演出了“雷大姑”，配合技术革新演出了“烈火红心”，配合共产主义思想教育演出了“我的一家”、“向秀丽”，配合反对美帝侵略黎巴嫩演出了“艾森豪威尔现形记”，西藏上层反动分子叛变时演出了“文成公主”，配合社会主义总路线教育运动演出了“人民公社好”等都及时的配合了党的中心运动，对群众起了很大的教育作用。
      培养一批又红又专的接班人
    党和政府对培养青年工作十分重视，十年来，给汉剧培养了一大批又红又专的接班人。本团以老师带徒弟的方法培养出具有一定成绩的青年演员三十三人，音乐十人，服装二人，灯光三人，舞台美术二人。1953年武汉市成立戏剧学校，经过六年的培养，六十二名具有高中文化程度和一定艺术修养的学生于1959年6月毕业，分配到武汉市汉剧团工作，壮大了汉剧队伍。为了更好的继承发扬党的汉剧事业，武汉市汉剧团于1957年招收学生二十八名，成立了训练班，随着形势迅速的发展，工农业大跃进，又于1958年招收学生三十名，在训练班的基础上成立了武汉市汉剧团附设戏剧学校。汉剧的青年一代像雨后的春笋一样蒸蒸日上。
    艺人要上山下乡不断加强思想改造
    十年来，党在剧团执行对知识分子的团结、教育、改造政策方面也取得很大的成绩，使文艺队伍的面貌焕然一新，不少艺人得到了党的挽救，获得了新的生命。
    我们这一支队伍基本上是属资产阶级知识分子范畴的，特别是年岁较大，在旧社会生活的时间很长的人，旧的思想意识非常浓厚，不抓紧进行政治思想教育，不加强思想改造，就会沿着资产阶级的老路走去。整风运动以前，由于没有正确执行党的团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，只一味的团结、照顾，而放松了教育、改造，因而资产阶级思想才得以继续泛滥，歪风邪气仍然存在，劳动纪律松弛，反对上山下乡为工农兵服务，好逸恶劳的思想普遍而严重的存在。在1958年大鸣大放中和向党交心中暴露出：“共产党和国民党差不多，既不讨厌，也不喜欢”，“共产党也好，国民党来也好，反正有奶便是娘”，公开宣称“人不为己，天诛地灭”“我不流芳百世，也要遗臭万年”等等，充分的说明了他们的严重的资产阶级立场观点。根据以上情况，党在剧团坚决贯彻了对知识分子的团结、教育、改造的政策，除加强经常的政治思想教育改变其立场观点以外，最主要的也是唯一方法，就是加强劳动锻炼，来改造思想，改造阶级感情。反右派斗争取得胜利以后，剧团党总支紧紧的抓住了这一环，大力组织演员上山下乡，下厂下部队，广泛深入的为工农兵演出，与工农兵群众相结合，积极参加劳动锻炼。1958年以来，上山下乡，下厂下部队平均每人达五次以上，最长的时间一次有三个月之多，下到工厂、部队、农村一面演出，一面劳动锻炼，一面与劳动模范英雄人物相结合。这种方法很有效，使同志们的思想大大提高一步。下去之后不但是演员，同时还是搬运员、炊事员、服务员、舞台美术工作人员。从挑水、做饭、洗衣、补衣、擦皮鞋、验票、对号、扫地、搬运服装道具到演出等一系列的工作都亲自动手去做。过去厌恶劳动的，现在热爱劳动了；不安心工作的，现在安心工作了；嫌工农脏的，现在以与工农群众接触，具有工农的思想感情而感到无尚光荣了；过去几个人干的工作，现在一个人干了，并且干得很好；过去不愿干的事，现在都争着去干……从不愿意下乡，到争取下乡；从厌恶劳动，到热爱劳动，思想感情起了根本的变化，了解了劳动的甘苦，一粒粮食一滴汗的甘苦，认识到资产阶级个人主义的危害性，有的同志说：“与工人、农民老大哥比起来，我们做的工作差的太远了，只不过是大海之一粟！”我们在党的英明领导下，在党经常的耐心的政治思想教育中，在上山下乡、下厂下部队与工农兵群众接触中，在长期的不断的劳动锻炼中，改造了我们的思想感情，使我们获得了新的生命。
    为了适应1960年国民经济大跃进的形势，我们要在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在文艺为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务和百花齐放、百家争鸣，推陈出新的方针指导下，实行全面规划，积极发展，重点建设，提高质量的工作方针，使汉剧工作更好的跃进，更好的为社会主义建设服务。
    对于我们汉剧工作者来说，学习毛泽东思想，具有特别重要的意义。我们必须认真的、持久的、反复的学习毛主席的著作，武装我们的头脑，不断的彻底的改造我们资产阶级的世界观，树立无产阶级的世界观，才能当革命的促进派，才能进一步对建设、创造社会主义共产主义的文化艺术事业，更好的贡献我们的力量。今后，我保证沿着党指引的道路前进，为社会主义事业，积极贡献我的一切力量。
