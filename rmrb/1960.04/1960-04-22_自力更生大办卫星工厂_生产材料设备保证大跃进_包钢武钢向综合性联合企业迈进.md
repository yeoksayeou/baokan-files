Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 21st — Baotou Steel Company, Wuhan Steel Company, and other metallurgical enterprises' basic construction workers, through self-reliance, utilizing internal industrial waste and local materials, are vigorously running satellite factories and engaging in diversified operations to produce building materials and machinery and equipment, ensuring high-speed construction.

Since the beginning of last year, in the mass movement to vigorously develop machinery repair and manufacturing and building material production, Baotou Steel has produced more than 1,000 various machine tools and implements, and more than 1,000 electric motors, solving the problem of insufficient supply of machinery and equipment and enabling it to complete the annual construction and installation plan for 1959 seventy days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 27%. About 40% of all non-standard equipment installed by Baotou Steel last year was manufactured by the workers themselves. In 1958, Baotou Steel mainly relied on its own strength to build a small-scale steel testing plant, which played a significant role in supplementing the shortage of steel during construction. Basic construction workers also actively expanded production bases, using prestressed concrete structures, reinforced concrete structures, and prestressed concrete pipes to replace the large amount of steel structures, steel pipes, and cast iron pipes used in the projects, which not only ensured that many key projects were put into production ahead of schedule, but also saved the country 8,000 tons of steel. In order to fundamentally solve the contradiction between high-speed construction and insufficient cement supply, last year, Baotou Steel workers built a cement plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons through self-reliance, and this year's production capacity will be doubled compared to last year. Since October last year, they have also learned from the experience of other places and produced and used a large amount of wet-ground slag concrete. Now, Baotou Steel has established a slag plant with an annual output of 300,000 cubic meters and a wet-ground slag concrete production base with an annual output of more than 180,000 cubic meters, as well as a slag wool workshop with an annual production capacity of over 6,000 tons and a hot-cast slag block workshop with an annual output of 12,000 cubic meters. This year, Baotou Steel's concrete projects can do without the state supplying cement for more than two-thirds of the projects. The workers also established a comprehensive utilization of wood factory from scratch, turning the sawdust and waste materials left over from the construction site into building materials such as shavings, wood shavings boards, and gypsum sawdust door and window materials. They also made templates from sorghum stalks and hemp stalks purchased from the local area to replace wooden templates, saving a large amount of wood. The workers of each civil engineering construction company have also manufactured more than 50 kinds of products such as welding rods, calcium carbide, high-grade insulation materials, and water glue, some of which not only meet the needs of their own companies, but also can support other construction units.

Now, Baotou Steel workers are also building a small-scale integrated enterprise from iron smelting and steelmaking to small steel rolling. In the near future, they will be able to avoid asking the state for cement; in terms of steel, as long as the state allocates a part of large and medium-sized steel, small-sized steel can be completely solved by themselves.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and other metallurgical enterprises have also achieved considerable success in self-reliance and diversified operations. The basic construction department of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has initially built a diversified business base. This base has a cement plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons, a refractory material plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons, and is building small factories and small steel plants that manufacture construction machinery and tools. After the mechanized construction station established its own machinery repair and manufacturing base, the utilization rate of automobiles increased from 44% in 1957 to 91.6% in 1959, and the utilization rate of heavy machinery increased from 57% in 1957 to 86.7% in 1959, becoming a red flag unit with the highest utilization rate of construction machinery among metallurgical construction enterprises in the country.

In order to promote the experience of metallurgical enterprises such as Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel in this regard, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held an on-site conference on self-reliance and diversified operations in Baotou Steel. Xia Yun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, pointed out in his concluding remarks: Diversified operations are a specific construction line and construction policy for implementing the general line in metallurgical industrial construction. Vigorously developing diversified operations can create favorable conditions for technological innovation and technological revolution, thereby promoting the high-speed development of metallurgical industrial construction. He required metallurgical enterprises all over the country to formulate diversified operation development plans, set goals, and establish lofty ambitions, striving to achieve more than half or even all of the cement used in the basic construction of metallurgical enterprises within half a year to a year. In terms of steel, they should not ask the state for or ask for less small-sized steel. On this basis, comprehensively solve the contradiction between the supply of the three major materials and high-speed construction, and promote the construction of metallurgical enterprises to move forward at a higher speed.

    自力更生大办卫星工厂　生产材料设备保证大跃进
    包钢武钢向综合性联合企业迈进
    本报包头21日电　包头钢铁公司、武汉钢铁公司等冶金企业的基本建设职工，自力更生，利用企业内部的工业废料和当地材料，大办卫星工厂，大搞多种经营，生产建筑材料和机器设备，保证了高速度进行建设。
    从去年年初以来，包钢在大搞机械修造和建筑材料生产的群众运动中，共生产了各类机床、机具一千多件，电动机一千多台，解决了部分机具和设备供应不足的问题，使1959年提前七十天超额27％完成了全年建筑安装计划。去年包钢安装的全部非标准设备中，40％左右是职工们自己制造的。1958年，包钢曾主要依靠自己力量，建成了一个小型钢铁试验厂，对补充施工中钢材的不足起了很大作用。基本建设职工还积极扩大生产基地，用予应力混凝土结构、钢筋混凝土结构和应力混凝土管等，代替工程上大量使用的钢结构、钢管和铸铁管，不但保证了许多重点工程提前投入生产，而且为国家节约了八千吨钢材。为了从根本上解决高速度建设和水泥供应不足的矛盾，去年，包钢职工自力更生建成了一座年产三万吨的水泥厂，今年生产能力将比去年扩大一倍。从去年10月份起，他们又学习外地经验，大量生产和使用了湿碾矿渣混凝土。现在，包钢已建立了年产三十万立方米的水渣厂和年产十八万立方米以上的湿碾矿渣混凝土生产基地，还建立了年产能力达六千吨以上的矿渣绵工段和年产一万二千立米的热铸矿渣块工段。今年包钢的混凝土工程，有三分之二以上可以不要国家供应水泥。职工们还白手起家建立了综合利用木材的工厂，把工地上用剩下的锯末、废料，制成刨花板、木屑板和石膏锯末门窗料等建筑材料，并把从当地收购来的秫秸麻秆，制作成模板，代替木模板，节约了大量木材。各个土木建筑公司的职工，也自己制造了电焊条、电石、高级保温材料、水胶等五十多种产品，有的不但满足了本公司的需要，还可以支援别的建设单位。
    现在，包钢职工又在兴建从炼铁、炼钢，一直到小型轧钢的小洋联合企业。不久以后，他们将做到不向国家要水泥；在钢材方面，只要国家分配一部分大、中型钢材，小型钢材完全可由自己解决。
    武汉钢铁公司等冶金企业，在自力更生、多种经营方面，也取得了不少成绩。武汉钢铁公司基本建设部门已初步建起一个多种经营基地。这个基地有年产十万吨的水泥厂、年产三万吨的耐火材料厂，并正在建设制造施工机械、工具的小型工厂和小型钢铁厂。机械化施工站建立了自己的机械修造基地以后，汽车利用率由1957年的44％提高到1959年的91.6％，重型机械利用率由1957年的57％提高到1959年的86.7％，成为全国冶金建筑企业施工机械利用率最高的红旗单位。
    为了推广包钢、武钢等冶金企业在这方面的经验，冶金工业部最近在包钢召开了自力更生、多种经营现场会议。冶金工业部副部长夏耘在总结发言中指出：多种经营，是在冶金工业建设中贯彻执行总路线的一条具体的建设路线和建设方针。大搞多种经营，就能够为技术革新和技术革命创造有利条件，从而促进冶金工业建设的高速度发展。他要求全国各地冶金企业，都要制订多种经营发展规划，定出奋斗目标，树立雄心大志，争取在半年到一年时间内，冶金企业基本建设中用的水泥，做到一半以上自给，甚至全部自给。钢材方面，做到不向国家要或少要小型钢材。在这个基础上，全面解决三大主材供应和高速度地进行建设之间的矛盾，促进冶金企业建设以更高的速度向前发展。（附图片）
