    A Good Play with Profound Educational Significance
    ——After Seeing "Comrade, You're Going the Wrong Way!"
    Li Chao
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre is currently staging a good play with high ideological and artistic value, which is "Comrade, You're Going the Wrong Way!", collectively created by comrades Yao Zhongming, Chen Bo'er, and others more than a decade ago.
    This play depicts the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese invaders were preparing to launch a large-scale mopping-up operation. The Eighth Route Army troops stationed behind enemy lines were actively implementing the anti-Japanese national united front proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, calling on all parties, factions, and armies to concentrate their forces to crush the enemy's mopping-up operation. However, Zhao Youchen, a stubborn warlord of the Kuomintang, tried every means to eliminate the Communist Eighth Route Army. Pan Hui, the director of the political department of our unit, used the Marxist class analysis viewpoint to be constantly vigilant against the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang army. However, Wu Zhike, a liaison minister sent by the higher authorities, mistakenly emphasized the united front as "everything through the united front." Commander Li Dongping, although a veteran Red Army cadre who was invincible in battle, believed that his theoretical level was low, and Minister Wu was sent by the higher authorities, so he should obey his views on the united front. Therefore, he repeatedly tolerated and conceded, causing the unit to abandon its town garrison, suffer bloodshed and sacrifice, and seriously endanger the interests of the Party. In the end, even Minister Wu himself was captured by the Kuomintang army, almost losing his life. Fortunately, thanks to Director Pan's correct analysis, judgment, and careful arrangements, they were rescued. At this time, from the lessons of blood, Minister Wu deeply realized how seriously right-leaning opportunist thought and class capitulationism harmed the interests of the Party, damaged the anti-Japanese forces, and caused the Party's outstanding cadres to sacrifice their precious lives.
    This play, through the portrayal of several veteran Red Army cadre images, and through the firm implementation of the correct thought of the united front of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the struggle against right-leaning capitulationism, expounds the major theme of opposing right-leaning opportunism.
    The play depicts a liaison minister from an intellectual background, holding Marxist-Leninist phrases, and interpreting the Party's united front policy wrongly with a dogmatic attitude. However, he knew nothing about the revolutionary reality of class struggle and national struggle. He lacked political struggle experience and looked down on others, believing that he was the one who understood Marxism best and knew the policy best. Therefore, when the Kuomintang army, under the pretext of holding a joint military meeting, brought troops to try to occupy Shanhe Town, a military stronghold where our troops were stationed, he resolutely advocated retreat, saying that this would show that the united front proposed by our Party was sincere, and "set an example for the friendly army." This was not all, under the guidance of this right-leaning capitulationist thought, Minister Wu also complacently fell into Zhao Youchen's trap of falsely claiming to jointly attack the Japanese invaders. He stopped Director Pan from blocking the Kuomintang army's sneak attack, saying that this would hinder the united front, leaving no room for maneuver, blindly believing the sophistry of the Kuomintang chief of staff, and one-sidedly listening to the words of Zhou, the regiment commander of the stubborn army, who was lurking in our army. He complained that the masses' level was low, and that the leading cadres were acting as the tail of the masses, and did not pay attention to the Party's united front. In fact, what he was implementing was not the Party's policy, he only knew how to "temporarily deal with and cater to immediate events, cater to minor political changes, and forget the fundamental interests of the proletariat." Like this Minister Wu, although he wholeheartedly wanted to implement the Party's policy, due to the error of right-leaning thought, his subjective wishes and actions were exactly the opposite of the objective effect. It was not until the enemy put a knife to his neck that he suddenly realized. In the performance, this character image was grasped by Comrade Zhang Tong; from his modeling, every move, to his clothing, he vividly conveyed the spiritual outlook of this character, showing that once a revolutionary falls into the bewitching array of bourgeois thought, he will violate the interests of the revolution and actually act as an accomplice of the enemy. The character image on the stage is thrilling, and the educational significance is extremely profound.
    In the play, the other characters on the opposing side of the contradiction are also vividly and powerfully portrayed. What is commendable is the shaping of Pan Hui, the long-trained director of the political department. The establishment of this character image not only uses vivid and clear language and aphorisms to vigorously develop the great significance of the combination of Marxism and the revolutionary practical struggle experience, but also fully unfolds the ideological struggle against right-leaning opportunism. What is even more valuable is that the script completes this character image through a series of his witty and courageous actions. The play depicts this character's steadfastness in class stand and political sensitivity. He knows the tricks of the Kuomintang stubborn army like the back of his hand, correctly judges their military intentions, and can also grasp our military's principle of initiative and flexibility. He not only twice struck at Zhao Youchen's invasion of the Kuomintang, but also when Commander Li and Minister Wu went deep into the stubborn army, he cleverly arranged an ambush around the enemy, forcing their raiding troops to retreat, protecting the lives of Commander Li and Minister Wu, and making the stubborn army lose a move. As for the scenes depicting ideological struggle, they do not only write about struggle without unity, or only about justified and forceful arguments without organizational discipline. In his several arguments with Minister Wu, Pan Hui's bright and upright quality and high degree of Party spirit are shown. Until the fourth act, Pan Hui repeatedly dissuades Commander Li and Minister Wu from easily believing Zhao Youchen and passing through his garrison, in order to prevent a secret attack; but Minister Wu, who has gone the wrong way, is obsessed and goes into the tiger's den. Pan Hui bravely fights with Commander Li to eliminate the enemy, rescues the comrades who are in danger, and also saves Wu Zhike's dangerous erroneous thought.
    In the performance, Comrade Lü Qi portrayed Pan Hui's serious revolutionary attitude, clear class feelings, and his experienced and decisive demeanor, leaving us with an unforgettable impression. Of course, we also hope that he will be more amiable, approachable, and colorful.
    Speaking of successful character images, one cannot fail to mention Commander Li Dongping. The script gives this character clear colors and lines. In the arrangement of the plot of the play, although he is introduced as a hero on the battlefield, a sharpshooter, nicknamed "Iron Eagle," he is by no means a crude fellow in the greenwood. He has rich experience in hundreds of battles and a loyal quality. His character is straightforward, humble, and has the qualities of organizational discipline. Under the guidance of the Party, he has been trained to have the ability to be invincible in battle and overcome all obstacles. When these battle achievements and the fruits of victory were handed over to Zhao Youchen by Minister Wu, he still respected the minister sent by the higher authorities very much. His theoretical level is low, and he lacks the ability to think independently. On some major issues, he listened to Minister Wu's opinions and opposed Director Pan's proposals, which resulted in the Party's losses in many events. However, this simple and lovely, firm and brave commander is good at distinguishing right from wrong in the face of the development of objective things. He is brave enough to admit his mistakes, and at the same time has self-knowledge of his narrow empiricism. Therefore, this struggle against right-leaning capitulationist thought unfolds complex contradictions and enhances and enriches the elaboration of the theme thought. Comrade Yang Baozong's performance is excellent. He not only grasped the simple and clear vivid language of the script, but also showed the temperament of this character from a worker-peasant background. If we put forward higher demands, that is, not only should this lovely and respectable image have the straightforwardness of a revolutionary soldier, the excellent traditional style of the Eighth Route Army, and the characteristics of hard work, simplicity, and closeness to the people, but also should have a high degree of political sensitivity, political awareness, and communist ideological style.
    In the play, although there are not many scenes, the character of Company Commander Hu is very impressive. This character is shaped very vividly and powerfully. Although he does not have Director Pan's political theory cultivation, nor can he compare with Commander Li's strategy and tactics, he also has the same loyalty and heroic and tenacious spirit to the revolution. He understands class struggle and has mastered the experience of political struggle against the Kuomintang; he keenly feels the flavor of Minister Wu's right-leaning capitulationism; he can put personal gains and losses aside, but he is meticulous about the interests of the revolution. From this revolutionary firmness and the spirit of heroic unyielding and disregard for death when finally surrounded by the enemy, he very prominently completes a typical image of an Eighth Route Army commander. Especially at the moment when the enemy is about to harm them, Minister Wu realizes the truth in the face of this ironclad fact, hates himself, and curses the enemy, and this Company Commander Hu, who has always been dissatisfied with Minister Wu, comforts and encourages Minister Wu with comradely deep class feelings: "The enemy's knife has been put on our necks, complaining about others and hating ourselves are useless, only hate that we can't see these counter-revolutionaries' heads and bodies separated with our own eyes." These few words are so powerful when said in such a specified situation, and the character image is portrayed so gloriously, as if he immediately becomes taller in front of us. In the performance, Comrade Hu Zhiquan, who plays this character, firmly grasped the specific task in the specified situation in creating this role.
    The play also shapes the heroic image of the local peasant self-defense captain, who has the same heroic, tenacious, and loyal qualities as Company Commander Hu, showing a clear and firm class stand and class feelings. From such a character, it generally reflects that the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army is not only the people's own army, but also the people's mentor and school. It constantly cultivates many outstanding revolutionaries and communist fighters in the revolutionary process.
    The script's depiction of the negative characters is also vivid, breaking away from the old stereotypes of simple rudeness and licentiousness, and excavating the true faces of the reactionary classes, such as the cunning and treachery of the stubborn army.
    This play, although it depicts the opposition to right-leaning capitulationism in the implementation of the anti-Japanese united front during the Anti-Japanese War, still has profound practical educational significance for opposing right-leaning opportunist thought that appears in different forms in socialist construction today.

### 教育意义极深的好戏——“同志，你走错了路”观后

    教育意义极深的好戏
    ——“同志，你走错了路”观后
    李超
    北京人民艺术剧院现在正上演着一出思想性和艺术性都高的好戏，这就是十几年前姚仲明、陈波儿等同志集体创作的“同志，你走错了路！”
    这个戏描写抗日战争初期日寇准备发动一次大扫荡，驻守在敌后的八路军某部正积极地执行着党中央和毛主席提出的抗日民族统一战线，号召各党各派各军集中力量粉碎敌人的大扫荡，而国民党顽固军阀赵友臣却千方百计地想要消灭共产党八路军。我们这支部队的政治部主任潘辉以马克思主义阶级分析的观点时刻警惕着国民党军队的反动性。而上级派来的一个联络部长吴志克，却错误地把统一战线强调为“一切通过统一战线”。司令员李东平虽然是攻无不克战无不胜的红军老干部，但是自以为理论水平低，而吴部长又是上级派来的，应该服从他对统一战线的看法，所以一次再一次地容忍、退让，造成这支部队放弃城镇驻地、流血牺牲，严重地危害了党的利益；最后连吴部长自己也被国民党军队俘掳，几乎送掉性命。幸而由于潘主任的正确分析、判断，以及周密的布置，才挽救了他们；这时候，从血的教训中，吴部长才深刻地认识到右倾机会主义思想和阶级投降主义是怎样严重地危害了党的利益，损害了抗日力量，使党的优秀干部牺牲了宝贵的生命。
    这出戏通过对几个红军老干部形象的描写，通过坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席统一战线的正确思想，同右倾投降主义的斗争，阐发了反对右倾机会主义的重大主题。
    剧中写了一个知识分子出身的联络部长，抱着马克思列宁主义的词句，以教条主义的态度，错误地解释着党的统一战线政策；而对于阶级斗争、民族斗争的革命实际却一窍不通。他自己缺乏政治斗争经验而又看不起别人，不相信群众，认为自己是最懂得马克思主义，最了解政策的。所以当国民党军队假借开联军会议，带部队来企图占领我们这支部队所驻的军事要地山河镇的时候，他坚决主张退让，说这才能表示我们党提出的统一战线是真诚的，要为“友军作出一个榜样”。这还不算，在这种右倾投降主义思想指导下的吴部长，还沾沾自喜地钻进赵友臣伪称联合攻打日寇的圈套；他阻止潘主任阻击国民党军队的偷袭，说这是有碍统一战线，不留转圜余地，一味轻信国民党参谋长的诡辩，和偏听顽固军潜伏在我军的周团长的一面之词。他抱怨群众水平低，领导干部作了群众尾巴，没有重视党的统一战线，其实他执行的并不是党的政策，他只知道“临时应付，迁就眼前的事变，迁就微小的政治变动，忘记无产阶级的根本利益”。像这位吴部长虽然满心想贯彻党的政策，但由于右倾思想的错误，使他的主观愿望与行为同客观效果恰恰相反，等到敌人把刀子放在他脖子上的时候，才恍然大悟。在演出中，这个人物形象为张瞳同志所掌握；从他的造形，一举一动到服饰，都生动地传达了这一人物的精神面貌，表现出一个革命者一旦陷入资产阶级思想的迷魂阵，就会违反革命的利益，实际上作了敌人的帮凶。舞台上的这个人物形象是令人惊心动魄的，教育意义是极其深刻的。
    在剧中，对矛盾的另一方的几个人物也作了生动有力的描写，值得称颂的是那位久经锻炼的政治部主任潘辉的塑造。这个人物形象的树立，不但是用了生动鲜明的语言和警句，有声有色地发挥了马克思主义和革命实际斗争经验相结合的重大意义，也充分展开了对右倾机会主义的思想斗争。更可贵的是剧本通过他一连串机智勇敢的行为动作，来完成这个人物形象。剧中描写了这个人物在阶级立场上的坚定和政治上的敏感，他对国民党顽固军的鬼把戏了如指掌，正确地判断了他们的军事意图，也能掌握我们军事上主动灵活的原则，他不但两次打击了国民党赵友臣的进犯，而且当李司令员和吴部长深入顽固军的时候，他巧妙地在敌人周围布置了埋伏，迫使他们偷袭的部队退回去，保护了李司令员和吴部长的生命，使顽固军输了一着。至于描写思想斗争的场面也不是只写斗争而无团结，只有理直气壮而无组织纪律，在他几次和吴部长的争论中，都表现了潘辉光明磊落的品质和高度的党性。直到第四幕，潘辉再三劝阻李司令员和吴部长不要轻易相信赵友臣，通过他的驻地，以防暗算；但是走错了路的吴部长执迷不悟，一直陷入虎穴，而潘辉却勇敢地和李司令员消灭了敌人，解救了遭到危难的同志的生命，同时也挽救了吴志克那危险的错误思想。
    在演出中，吕齐同志刻画了潘辉的严肃的革命态度、鲜明的阶级感情和他那老练果断的风度，给我们留下了难忘的印象，当然我们也希望他更和蔼可亲丰富多彩。
    谈到成功的人物形象，不能不提到司令员李东平。剧本赋予这个人物以鲜明的色彩和线条。在戏剧情节的安排上，虽然介绍他是个战场上的英雄、神枪手，外号“铁老鹰”，但他决不是绿林中的老粗。他有身经百战的丰富经验和忠心耿耿的品质。他的性格爽朗、谦虚而又有组织性纪律性的素养，他在党的教导下，锻炼得有战无不胜攻无不克的本领。当这些战功和胜利的战果被吴部长双手送给了赵友臣的时候，他对这位上级派来的部长还是非常尊重。他的理论水平低，缺乏独立思考能力，在一些重大的问题上听从了吴部长的意见，反对了潘主任的主张，以致在许多事件上造成了党的损失。但是这位朴实可爱、坚毅勇敢的指挥员，在客观事物发展的面前是善于辨别是非的，他勇于承认错误，同时对自己狭隘的经验主义有自知之明，由此，就使这一场反对右倾投降主义思想的斗争，展开了复杂的矛盾冲突，加强和丰富了对主题思想的阐发。杨宝琮同志演得是出色的，他不但掌握了剧本简单明了的生动语言，也表现了这个人物工农出身的气质。如果再提出更高的要求，那就是不但要使这个可爱可敬的形象有革命军人的爽直、八路军的优良传统作风和刻苦朴实亲切近人的特点，还应该具有高度的政治敏感、政治觉悟和共产主义的思想作风。
    在剧中虽然戏不是很多，但给人印象却十分深刻的人物，要数胡连长。这个人物塑造得真是鲜明有力，他虽然没有潘主任的政治理论修养，也比不得李司令在战略战术上的韬略，但他对革命也同样有赤胆忠心、英勇顽强的气魄。他懂得阶级斗争，掌握了对国民党政治斗争的经验；他敏锐地感到吴部长右倾投降主义的味道；他能置个人得失于不顾，而对革命的利益却一丝不苟。从这种革命的坚定性和最后陷入敌人包围时的英勇不屈、视死如归的精神，很突出地完成了一个八路军指挥员的典型形象。特别是在敌人要残害他们的刹那，吴部长在这铁的事实面前觉悟了，痛恨着自己，咒骂着敌人，而这位一向不满意吴部长的胡连长，却以同志式的带着深厚的阶级感情安慰和鼓励着吴部长：“敌人的刀已经放在我们的脖子上了，埋怨别人，痛恨自己都是没用的，只恨我们不能亲眼看到这些反革命的脑袋和身子分家。”这几句话放在这样一个规定情景中说出来是多么有力，把这个人物形象描画得多么光辉，好像他立刻在我们面前高大起来。在演出中，饰演这个人物的胡志宽同志，在创造这个角色中，牢牢地掌握住规定情景中的特定任务。
    剧中也塑造了当地农民自卫队长的英雄形象，他有着胡连长同样的英勇、顽强、忠心耿耿的素质，表现了鲜明坚定的阶级立场和阶级感情，从这样一个人物概括地反映了共产党八路军不但是人民的子弟兵，同时也是人民的导师和学校，它在革命的过程中不断培养出许多优秀的革命者、共产主义的战士。
    剧本在反面人物方面的描写也是生动的，脱出了一般以简单粗暴荒淫无耻来描写的旧套，挖掘出顽固军的奸狡阴诈等等反动阶级的真实嘴脸。
    这出戏，虽然描写的是抗日战争时期反对在执行抗日统一战线中的右倾投降主义，但是在社会主义建设的今天，对于反对以不同的表现形式出现的右倾机会主义思想，仍然有着深刻的现实教育意义。
