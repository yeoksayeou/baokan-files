　　The train, the ship, the station, the shop, receive hundreds and thousands of people every day. Their labor cannot be measured by the foot, nor can it be weighed on a scale, yet the quality of their work will bring different results; either bringing joy to people or bringing trouble to them...

　　In the old society, ordinary people suffered countless hardships and indignities when they took a train or a ship, or traveled far away. It was truly "home is good for a thousand days, but everything is difficult when you go out." After liberation, the train, the ship, the station, and the shop, in the spirit of serving the people, continuously improved their work and successively won honorary titles such as "Passenger's Home" and "Traveler's Home." People traveling reached a new conclusion: "Traveling is like being at home, everywhere are relatives." However, the shortcoming is that these "Passenger's Homes" and "Traveler's Homes" have not yet been completely twisted into a rope, forming a very closely connected "big family." When transferring trains, changing ships, and finding lodging, travelers still have to worry a bit. This is the origin of the "five worries" of some travelers in Longchang County.

　　Now, it's good that the Luda City organized a "one-stop" passenger transport service, and Longchang County organized a "one-stop" joint transport of passengers and luggage, both achieving that passengers can reach home with one ticket, and luggage is weighed to the end. Luda has also achieved the "five assurances" of all-inclusive food, accommodation, and travel, allowing passengers to be completely assured.

　　"Passenger's Homes" and "Traveler's Homes" are linked into a dragon. The red line that connects them is the spirit of communist cooperation. The spirit of communist cooperation has promoted the leap forward in production, the great development of science and technology... and now it has brought greater joy to people on the journey. May this red line rapidly extend to the vast cities, linking all trains, ships, stations, and shops into a dragon, weaving them into a network, and bringing greater happiness to travelers!

### 旅客的幸福

    旅客的幸福
    车、船、站、店，每天都要接待成百成千的人。他们的劳动既不能用尺量，也不能用秤称，然而质量好坏，却会得来不同的效果；或者带给人欢乐，或者带给人麻烦……。
    在旧社会，老百姓坐一次车，乘一次船，远行一次，不知要遭多少罪，受多少气。真是“在家千日好，出门事事难”。解放以后，车、船、站、店本着为人民服务的精神，不断改进工作，纷纷获得“乘客之家”、“旅客之家”等光荣称号。旅行的人得出新的结论：“出门如在家，到处是亲人。”可是，美中不足的是：这些“乘客之家”、“旅客之家”还没有完全拧成一股绳，组成一个联系十分密切的“大家庭”，转车，换船，找住处，旅客们还要多操点心。这就是隆昌县有些旅客“五耽心”的由来。
    现在好了，旅大市组织了客运“一条龙”，隆昌县组织了旅客、行李“一条龙”联运，都作到了旅客一票到家，行李一磅到底，旅大还作到了包食包住包行，让旅客们“五放心”，全放心。
    “乘客之家”、“旅客之家”联成龙了。把它们联在一起的红线，是共产主义的大协作精神。共产主义协作精神促进了生产跃进，科学技术大发展……现在又给旅途中的人们带来了更大的欢乐。愿这条红线迅速向广大城市延伸，把所有车、船、站、店联成龙，织成网，带给旅客更大的幸福！
