Heroic People Transform Mountains and Rivers
Representative Li Chengzhi Discusses Shandong's Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial accounts and the draft national budget for 1960, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I am determined to implement the guidelines, policies, and tasks put forward in the reports. I would like to report to the conference on the water conservancy construction work in Shandong Province, and I welcome criticism and correction from all representatives.

In 1959, the water conservancy construction work in our province, like that of all brother provinces across the country, under the correct and wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and especially inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement, achieved a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958. Since last winter, the people of the province have responded to the great call of the Provincial Party Committee to fundamentally change the natural appearance of Shandong in three years of hard work. At one point, tens of millions of laborers were mobilized, setting off an unprecedented upsurge in water conservancy construction. The province, prefectures, and counties have successively started construction on 255 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, including Yellow River key projects, dam projects, reservoir groups on major mountain rivers, river management, and irrigation areas of over 10,000 mu. Various small-scale projects are even more numerous and widespread. To date, we have successfully completed the original task of 4 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, expanded the irrigated area by 20 million mu, improved the irrigated area by 11 million mu, newly controlled 6,800 square kilometers of soil erosion area, newly treated and transformed 8.5 million mu of waterlogged and low-lying land, and also built a number of hydropower stations and water conservancy stations. With the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, the technical force has grown rapidly, and the technical level has improved significantly. Since the Provincial Party Committee held the Changwei on-site conference in December last year, a super-quota, high-efficiency movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution has been vigorously launched on the water conservancy front throughout the province. Quotas have been broken repeatedly, work efficiency has been continuously improved, and innovation experts and high-efficiency pacesetters have emerged one after another, making the entire water conservancy construction not only fast in progress but also high in efficiency and good in quality. Thanks to the rapid development of water conservancy construction, last year, under the strong leadership of the Party and the government, the people of our province overcame the most severe drought in 30 years, achieved a greater harvest than in 1958, and changed the historical law that a severe drought inevitably leads to crop failure. The drought resistance and crop protection movement not only tested the water conservancy projects but also deeply educated the broad masses of the people. People further realized the importance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." Now, the entire water conservancy construction in the province has entered a new stage of unified planning, comprehensive management, comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization, and gradual establishment of a relatively comprehensive and complete water conservancy project system.

Eradicate the scourge of the Yellow River, Develop the Yellow River's water resources
In terms of Yellow River management, on the basis of the victory in flood prevention and disaster elimination, in accordance with the central government's policy of eradicating the scourge of the Yellow River and developing the Yellow River's water resources, a series of water conservancy projects have been carried out in recent years. Up to now, the province has built 11 Yellow River diversion culvert gates and 38 rainbow siphon Yellow River irrigation projects, with a total designed water diversion capacity of 1,930 cubic meters per second, increasing the controlled irrigation area to 60 million mu, equivalent to nearly 20 times the cumulative irrigated area in our province before liberation. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the million-strong army of our province marched toward the Yellow River with great momentum and invincibility. At the same time, all parties cooperated closely, and the troops vigorously supported, creating unprecedented achievements in Yellow River water conservancy construction. In just over two years, 10 Yellow River diversion gates have been built, controlling an irrigation area of 51.06 million mu, an increase of 4.6 times compared to before 1958. In particular, the Weishan Hub project, which serves as the heart of water conservancy in our province, has been constructed in a short period of more than a year, including the Yellow River diversion gate, the diversion gate, the embankment of the Dadongping Lake Reservoir, the lake outlet gate, and the river-blocking gate, all of which are large-scale, widely distributed, and technically complex projects. The cofferdam that cuts off the Yellow River fully demonstrated the great power and infinite wisdom of the working people during the construction process. It adopted the standing cofferdam method created by the working people of our country in their struggle with rivers—the straw bale advancement cofferdam method. Without using a single pound of cement or a single steel bar, with the support of the brother province of Henan, it was successfully closed on December 9 last year in just 14 days. It created a precedent for blocking rivers and building dams using indigenous methods on the Yellow River's downstream plains, paving the way for the construction of several downstream stages in the future. With the completion of several lake-entry gates, the Weishan Hub can begin to use the Dadongping Lake Reservoir to regulate the Yellow River's water volume this year, thereby fundamentally eliminating the threat of ice jams in the downstream and basically solving the flood control problem below Weishan, and providing irrigation water for more than 40 million mu in the Liaocheng, Jining, Jinan, Zibo, and Changwei areas of our province. The history of the Yellow River causing harm for thousands of years will come to an end from now on. A new era of benefiting the people will begin from now on. This is one of the historical miracles of the great Mao Zedong era. In addition, two other hub projects also started construction last winter and this spring. After the completion of these projects, they will create good conditions for the provincial water conservancy network. The Jiaoji and Deji Canals can then be built accordingly, and the appearance of agricultural production in the province will undergo even greater changes. In terms of small-scale Yellow River diversion projects, Shouzhang County, for example, gave full play to its initiative, planned and designed independently, adopted indigenous methods, relied on the masses to overcome various difficulties, and built the Liulou Yellow River diversion culvert gate in just two months. During the drought resistance last year, it diverted water to irrigate 1.1 million mu of fertile land, winning a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought, with an average yield of over 700 jin per mu throughout the county, and five "thousand-jin" communes emerged. The commune members sang, "No drought in the year of severe drought, the Yellow River tamed to irrigate fertile land, if not for the commune's power to reverse the situation, we could not turn drought into a bumper year." Taking advantage of the drought resistance efforts, the county's farmland water conservancy made rapid progress, and another Yellow River diversion gate was newly built in Wangji, expanding the irrigated area from 600,000 mu in 1958 to 1.3 million mu, and renovating the paddy fields according to the standards of advanced garden-style farmland, digging five-level canals, and realizing the systematization of drainage and irrigation canals and the standardization of roads.

Managing Mountains and Water, Thousands of Reservoirs and Ten Thousand Ponds
In terms of managing mountains and water, all parts of the province have seen great development, especially the Linyi area. Since last winter, a new upsurge in large-scale water conservancy construction, centered on thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand ponds, combining large, medium, and small-sized projects, with the aim of irrigation and benefiting the people, has been launched throughout the region. Combined with the renovation of irrigation canal systems, a vigorous movement for garden-style farmland has been carried out, adopting the high-standard management methods of "one unity" (unified planning), "four transformations" (water conservancy, garden-style farmland, garden-style land, and standardized roads), and "eight combinations" (combining storage, irrigation, drainage, afforestation, animal pens, ponds, threshing grounds, and roads). This winter and spring, 7.26 million mu of wheat fields and spring fields have been turned into garden-style farmland, fundamentally changing the appearance of the entire area. At present, reservoirs are everywhere, canals crisscross, and the land is flat, beginning to show the beautiful prospects of a garden-style land.

In water conservancy construction, the Linyi area, in contrast to the "reach out" faction and the "difficulty" theorists, did not ask the state for everything or rely on the state to solve every difficulty. Instead, they held high the red flag of the General Line, relied on the powerful strength of the People's Communes, and pushed water conservancy construction to a new stage of continuous leap forward. The water storage capacity of the six major reservoirs built last year exceeded five times the total water storage capacity of reservoirs built in the past five years. Since last winter and this spring, the people of the Linyi area have also resolved to cut off the Yi, Shu, and Wen Rivers, and put forward ambitious goals. Now, the commune heroes fighting at the Yishui Basha Mountain, Mengyin Antie, Juxian Qingfeng Ridge, and Yiyuan Tianzhuang four major reservoirs are conquering the "dragons" that have devoured the lives and property of the people for thousands of years with their high aspirations and heroic actions. People will conquer nature and become the masters of nature.

While carrying out large and medium-sized projects, the millions of people in the Linyi area, taking water as the key, vigorously engaged in a small-scale movement of thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand ponds, and in combination with the renovation of the irrigation system, prominently focused on deep plowing and leveling the land, and vigorously engaged in garden-style farmland and garden-style land. The Junan Dashan People's Commune, which has the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and was praised by Chairman Mao, has created amazing achievements in the struggle to transform hills and poor mountains and evil waters. After the basic completion of the three autumn tasks last year, the entire commune mobilized more than 11,000 laborers to continue to carry forward the indomitable perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, and launched a general offensive against water, fertilizer, and soil with the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution. On the basis of the original victory over poor mountains and evil waters, they further cut high and filled low, cut wide and filled narrow, straightened curves, and bravely advanced towards the high-standard garden-style farmland and garden-style land of comprehensive management of mountainous and hilly land with "one unity, four transformations, and eight combinations." After the intense battles of more than 10,000 people on the six major battlefields of "North War Dashan Reservoir, South Conquest Huashigang, East Take Changsha Ridge, West War Qipan Mountain, Red Flags on Motian Ridge, and Heroic Meeting in Heroic Mountain," the mountains, water, fields, and forests of the entire commune have been completely renewed. The original barren mountains and bald ridges have now been transformed into: "Looking closely, they are garden-style fields; looking from a distance, they are garden-style land; reservoirs and ponds are connected; canals run through; roads are smooth; and the sea of trees is boundless," a hilly garden-style land on a preliminary scale. The past mountainous and hilly thin land has achieved water conservation, soil conservation, fertilizer conservation, water storage, drainage, irrigation, convenient mechanized farming, and guaranteed production against drought and flood. Therefore, the commune members excitedly said: "The thin sandy ridge has become a land of rice and grain, the stony mound has become a large orchard, the poor mountain gully has become a fish pond, the narrow path has become flat and wide, grain production creates high yields every year, and life is getting better and better. Where does this happiness come from? Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao."

Overcoming Natural Barriers, Diverting Water Up the Mountains
In terms of diverting water up the mountains and realizing water conservancy in mountainous areas, Zibo City carried forward the successful experience of the Sai Long project of the E'zhuang Commune and began to fundamentally manage the Zibo River, which had been causing harm every year, in 1958. The people along the river, with their daring and capable style and heroic spirit of moving mountains and filling the sea, created this magnificent and arduous project of taming the Zibo River. The Xunzi Great Canal, which chisels thousands of mountains, fills hundreds of rivers, and detours around mountains to capture water and bring it up the mountains, flows through 42 villages and is 122 li long. It can not only irrigate more than 100,000 mu of farmland but also solve the extremely rare domestic water for 60,000 people, and can also build eight hydroelectric power stations and more than 100 hydraulic power stations. This is a great canal that passes through thousands of difficulties and dangers. It surrounds 42 mountain tops, crosses hundreds of rivers and streams, opens up mountains for 40 li, builds nearly 100,000 meters of stone walls, and splits cliffs and chisels ridges in more than 20 places, erecting seven large water-crossing bridges six to seventeen meters high. The Longwang Cliff, Hutou Mountain, Leopard Eye Mountain, and other more than 20 precipices and cliffs passed by the canal are all places rarely visited by birds and animals. Under the leadership of the Party, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the commune and the strength and wisdom of the masses, the heroic people in the upper reaches of the Zibo River overcame numerous difficulties and layers of natural barriers, and built this heroic canal in these mountains, just as people sing: "The Zibo River flows long and winding, and its appearance changes with a thunderous sound. Water diversion canals are all over the mountains, and trees are planted everywhere. The ridge terraces are watered, and poor mountains become lands of fish and rice."

In terms of developing and utilizing groundwater, Pingdu County created rich experience in finding ways to tap groundwater sources and comprehensively utilizing groundwater. With the heroic spirit of "drilling through the earth to open up a heavenly river," they made groundwater turn into surface free-flowing water, which is not only used to irrigate farmland but also to generate electricity, grind flour, and greatly develop aquaculture. In response to the different characteristics of mountainous, plain, and waterlogged areas, they fully utilized natural conditions to create a complete set of methods for developing and utilizing groundwater. Last winter, they organized an army of 40,000 people to fight for ten days, cutting off ten rivers, and building the great "East Water West Diversion" project, which combines three waters, comprehensively develops storage, irrigation, drainage, navigation, roads, forests, fish, and electricity, and is 130 li long, running across the county, forming a free-flowing irrigation network system in which rivers are connected, ditches are connected, and canals are connected. It comprehensively combines the storage and irrigation of mountainous and hilly areas, the flood prevention and drainage of plain waterlogged areas, and the great irrigation benefits. This fully demonstrates the great initiative of the People's Commune's infinite power to lock up a hundred dragons in one fell swoop.

Transforming Waterlogged Areas, Eliminating Pests and Promoting Benefits
For the transformation of plain waterlogged saline-alkali land, we have initially explored some experience according to the different conditions in different areas of our province. Wudi County on the Bohai Sea coast, after greatly changing saline-alkali land, removed the low-yield label of bitter sea salt fields and waterlogged areas, and achieved the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. The saline-alkali land of the past is now a land of rice and grain. The Taozhao People's Commune in Rizhao County, which has suffered from wind, sand, sea waves, and barren alkali, has taken measures to build dams and gates, dig squares and build dikes in combination with sealing beaches and afforestation, which not only prevents the invasion of sea waves and protects salt fields and farmland, but also uses the original alkaline barren land to plant reeds and rice and develop a large number of marine aquaculture, becoming a land of fish and rice with endless forests, continuous reeds, large rice harvests, and the simultaneous development of fishing and salt. In the waterlogged areas around the lake, there is the experience of Jinxiang County in combining water storage and water diversion, river networks, and mechanical drainage and irrigation. In the plain waterlogged areas, adopting the river network method is indeed the fundamental direction for water management. The eight-transformation integrated river network project in Caoxian County is a fundamental measure to completely solve the three harms of drought, flood, and salinity in plain waterlogged saline-alkali areas, and it is the most thorough and revolutionary method to change the natural appearance. The basic characteristics of this project are: comprehensive planning, comprehensive management, simultaneous elimination of pests and promotion of benefits, combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and combination of large-scale projects and small-scale projects. A new appearance of three waters (canals, rivers, wells) used together, three harms (drought, flood, salinity) eliminated together, and five industries flourishing together has emerged.

The Achievements of Water Conservancy Construction are the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought
The reason why our province's water conservancy construction has achieved the above-mentioned achievements is the victory of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In our work practice, we have more deeply realized the absolute correctness and unparalleled power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Facts fully prove that the Party's General Line for socialist construction not only fully expresses the strong desire of the people of our country to rapidly change the state of poverty and backwardness and build our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible, but also correctly reflects the objective laws of socialist construction in our country. Once this General Line is grasped by the masses, it will generate infinite wisdom and strength and will be able to develop all socialist construction undertakings in our country in a faster, better, and more economical way. It is precisely because our province has implemented the Party's General Line in water conservancy construction work that it has achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The People's Commune, with its unparalleled superiority and strong vitality, is also the fundamental guarantee for the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction. Without the superiority of the People's Commune's "large-scale and public ownership," it would be impossible to carry out the above-mentioned large-scale mass water conservancy construction. Facts also fully prove that the water conservancy construction policy put forward by the Party Central Committee, focusing on storage, small-scale projects, and commune-run projects, is the only correct policy for developing our country's water conservancy undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way. Since the Great Leap Forward, in addition to the thousands of small-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects and mountain management and flood control projects that have been built by the masses relying on their own efforts, some large and medium-sized backbone projects have also been built in accordance with the principle of commune-run and government-assisted. Since 1958, more than half of the materials such as cement, steel, and wood needed for the projects sponsored by state investment have been raised and solved by local authorities and people's communes themselves, in addition to the state allocation and support.

In short, what agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past, the People's Communes have now done. The People's Communes have greater superiority than advanced agricultural cooperatives in terms of fully mobilizing and rationally using labor. The People's Communes not only provide strong human and material conditions for water conservancy construction, but more importantly, they have improved people's ideological awareness and cultivated people's communist spirit. They not only cooperated and supported each other within the commune and county, but also launched friendly cooperation and support between counties and between special zones. Therefore, projects that would normally take two or three years to complete can now be completed in seven or eight months at most one year. The vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes can be fully demonstrated by the amazing achievements made in water conservancy construction.

Fellow representatives, our work is still far from enough, and there is still a considerable distance from realizing our province's entire water conservancy plan. In particular, we still have a lot of work to do to strive to master enough water sources to fully exert irrigation benefits. We are determined to, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the victorious path guided by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother provinces and continue to make unremitting efforts. In particular, we are currently facing a severe spring drought. The people of Shandong Province are implementing the Provincial Party Committee's combat call to resist drought and protect wheat and resist drought and protect planting with the strong will and combat actions to resist drought until the sky bows its head and no rain falls to ensure a bumper harvest, and are determined to win a great wheat harvest and fight the first battle on the agricultural production front, in order to fully realize a comprehensive bumper harvest in production, ideology, and technology in 1960, and are determined to strive to achieve the various targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

专栏：

    英雄人民改造河山
    李澄之代表谈山东水利建设成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告，以及人大常委会的工作报告，并坚决贯彻执行报告中所提出的方针、政策和任务。我谨就山东省的水利建设工作向大会作一汇报，请各位代表批评指正。
    我省1959年的水利建设工作，同全国各兄弟省一样，在党中央和毛主席的正确英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，特别在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，获得了比1958年更大更好更全面的跃进。去冬以来，全省人民响应了省委提出的苦战三年基本改变山东自然面貌的伟大号召，曾有千万劳动大军上阵，掀起了史无前例的水利建设高潮。省专县各地先后开工的黄河枢纽、闸坝工程、主要山水河流上的水库群以及河道治理、万亩以上的灌区等大、中型水利工程就有二百五十五项，各种小型工程更是星罗棋布，遍地开花。到目前为止，已胜利地完成了原定四十亿立方米的土石方任务。扩大灌溉面积二千万亩，改善灌溉面积一千一百万亩，控制水土流失面积新增六千八百平方公里，治理改造涝洼地新增八百五十万亩，另外还建成了若干水电站、水利站。随着水利工程的大量兴建，技术力量迅速增长，技术水平显著提高。自去年12月省委召开昌潍现场会议以来，一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的超定额高工效运动，在全省水利战线上蓬勃展开。定额一再突破，工效不断提高，革新能手、高工效标兵层出不穷，使整个水利建设，不但进度快，而且工效高，质量好。由于水利建设的迅猛发展，去年我省人民在党和政府的坚强领导下，战胜了三十年来未有的严重旱灾，夺得了比1958年更大的丰收，改变了大旱必歉的历史规律。抗旱保收运动，不仅考验了水利工程，而且深深地教育了广大人民群众。人们进一步体会到毛主席所指示的“水利是农业的命脉”的重要意义。现在，全省整个水利建设已经走向一个统一规划、综合治理、全面开发、综合利用、逐步建立比较全面的、完整的水利工程系统的新阶段。
    根治黄河水害，开发黄河水利
    在黄河治理方面，在防洪除害胜利的基础上，根据中央提出的根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的方针，最近几年来，进行了一系列的水利工程。截止目前，全省已建成引黄涵闸十一座，虹吸引黄灌溉工程三十八处，总计设计引水能力一千九百三十秒立方米，增加控制灌溉面积达六千万亩，相当于我省解放前累计灌溉面积近二十倍。特别是1958年大跃进以来，我省百万大军向黄河进军，气势磅礴，所向无敌，同时各方密切配合，部队大力支援，在黄河水利建设上创造了前所未有的成绩。二年多的时间就建成了引黄闸十座，控制灌溉面积五千一百零六万亩，比1958年前增长四点六倍。尤其是作为我省水利心脏的位山枢纽工程，在短短的一年多时间，就修建了引黄闸、分水闸、大东平湖水库围堤、出湖闸、拦河闸等规模大、布局广、技术性相当复杂的各项工程。腰斩黄河的截流大坝，在施工中充分显示了劳动人民的伟大力量和无穷智慧，采用我国劳动人民与江河斗争所创造出来的立堵法——秸埽进占截流法，没用一斤洋灰，没用一根钢筋，在河南兄弟省的支援下，仅仅十四天时间就于去年12月9日胜利合龙了。它开创了在黄河下游平原用土法拦河筑坝的先例，为今后下游几个梯级的修建开辟了道路。随着几个进湖闸的建成，位山枢纽今年即可开始利用大东平湖水库来调节黄河的水量，从此根除了下游的凌汛威胁和基本上解决了位山以下的防洪问题，并使我省聊城、济宁、济南、淄博、昌潍等地区四千多万亩的灌溉用水得到供应。几千年来黄河为害的历史将从此结束。造福人民的新时期将从此开始。这是伟大的毛泽东时代的历史奇迹之一。此外，其他两个枢纽工程亦于去冬今春先后开工，这几个工程完成后将对全省水利河网化创造良好条件。胶济、德济等运河即可随之兴建，全省农业生产面貌将有更大的改变。在小型引黄工程方面，以寿张县为例，他们充分发挥了积极性，自行规划设计，采取土法上马，依靠群众克服了种种困难，仅用两个月时间建成了刘楼引黄涵闸，在去年抗旱中引水灌溉良田一百一十万亩赢得了大旱之年庆丰收，全县平均亩产七百斤以上，并出现了五个千斤社。社员们歌唱“大旱之年不见旱，黄河驯服灌良田，若非公社回天力，不能旱灾变丰年”。该县农田水利，乘抗旱之风，急剧跃进，又在王集新建引黄闸一处，灌溉面积由1958年的六十万亩扩大到一百三十万亩，并按照高级园田化的标准，整修了畦田，挖好了五级渠道，实现了排灌渠系统化和道路规格化。
    治山治水，千库万塘
    在治山治水方面，全省各地都有很大的发展，特别是临沂地区，去冬以来，在全区范围内掀起了一个规模巨大的，以灌溉兴利为目的，以千库万塘为中心的大中小相结合的水利建设新高潮。并结合灌溉渠系的修整，大力开展了耕地园田化运动，采取了一统（统一规划）四化
  （水利化、耕地园田化、大地园林化、道路规格化）八结合（蓄、灌、排、林、圈、池、场、路相结合）的高标准治理方法。去冬今春已完成了七百二十六万亩麦田和春田的园田化，使全区面貌发生了根本的变化。目前已是水库遍布，渠道纵横，土地平整，开始展示出大地园林化的美丽前景。
    在水利建设中，临沂地区，同“伸手”派和“困难”论者恰恰相反，他们不是什么都向国家要，什么困难都靠国家帮助解决，而是高举总路线红旗，依靠人民公社的强大力量，把水利建设推向一个持续跃进的新阶段。去年一年举办的六大水库的蓄水量就超过了以往五年举办水库蓄水总和的五倍。去冬今春以来，临沂地区人民又下定斩断沂、沭、汶河的决心，提出了宏伟的奋斗目标。现在战斗在沂水跋山、蒙阴岸堤、莒县青峰岭和沂源田庄四大水库的公社英雄们，正以他们轩昂的志气和英勇行动征服着千百年来吞噬人民生命财产的“蛟龙”。人们将征服自然，变成自然的主人。
    在进行大中型工程的同时，临沂地区的千百万人民以水为纲，大搞小型的千库万塘运动，并结合整修灌溉系统，突出地抓住深翻整平土地，大搞耕地园田化和大地园林化。具有愚公移山精神，曾受毛主席表扬的莒南大山人民公社，在改造丘岭与穷山恶水作斗争中，又创造出惊人的成绩。去年三秋工作基本结束后，全社出动了一万一千多名劳动大军，继续发扬了愚公移山的坚强毅力，以不断革命彻底革命的精神，向水、肥、土发起了总进攻。在原有战胜穷山恶水的基础上，进一步削高填洼，截宽补窄，去弯取直，向着“一统四化八结合”的综合治理山丘地的高标准园田化和园林化而奋勇前进。经过“北战大山水库、南征滑石岗、东取长沙岭、西战棋盘山、摩天岭上插红旗、英雄会师英雄山”六大战场上的万人以上的紧张的战斗，使全社的山、水、田、林面貌焕然一新。原来的荒山秃岭现在已经改造成：“近看是园田，远看是园林，库塘相连，渠道贯串，公路畅通，树海无边”的初具规模的丘岭园林化了。过去的山丘薄地，达到了保水保土保肥，能蓄能排能灌，机耕方便，旱涝保产。因此社员们兴奋的说：“薄沙岭变成米粮川，石磊子变成大果园，穷山沟变成了养鱼池，羊肠小道变平宽，粮食年年创高产，生活越来越美满，这些幸福哪里来？感谢党和毛主席”。
    突破天险，引水上山
    在引水上山，实现山区水利化方面，淄博市发扬了峨庄公社赛龙工程的成功经验，于1958年开始，对年年为害的淄河进行了根本治理。沿河人民以敢想敢做的风格和移山填海的英雄气魄，创办了这项雄伟而艰巨的驯淄工程。凿千山、填百河，绕重峦擒水上山的驯淄大干渠，流经四十二个村庄，全长一百二十二华里，不仅能灌溉十余万亩农田，还能够解决六万人民的极为难得的生活用水，并可修建八处水电站和百余座水力站。这是一条途经千艰万险的大干渠，它环绕四十二个山头，跨越百余条河涧，开山四十华里，砌石墙近十万米，劈崖凿岭二十余处，架六至一十七米高的大渡水桥七座。干渠所通过的龙王崖、虎头山、豹眼山等二十余处悬崖绝壁，都是些鸟兽罕到的地方。英雄的淄河上游人民，在党的领导下，依靠公社的无比优越性与群众的力量和智慧，突破了重重困难和层层天险，就在这丛山峻岭中，筑起了这条英雄渠道，正如人们所歌唱道：“淄河弯弯水流长，雷声一震变了样，引水渠道满山岗，满山遍野树成行，岭地梯田水利化，穷山变成鱼米乡”。
    在开发利用地下水方面，平度县创造了千方百计挖掘地下水源和综合利用地下水的丰富经验。他们以“钻透地球开天河”的英雄气魄，硬使地下水变成地上自流水，不仅用来灌溉农田，而且还让地下水发电、磨面和大量发展水产。针对山丘、平原和涝洼地区的不同特点，充分利用自然条件，创造了一套完整的开发利用地下水的方法。在去冬又组织了四万大军，奋战十天，腰斩十河，建成了伟大的“东水西调”，三水并用，蓄、灌、排、航、路、林、鱼、电全面发展的“十河一体”工程，全长一百三十华里，横贯全县，形成了河河相通，沟沟相连，渠渠相接的自流灌溉河网系统，把山区丘岭的蓄灌、平原涝洼的防洪除涝和大兴灌溉之利全面的结合起来，这充分显示了人民公社力无穷，一举锁住百条龙的伟大创举。
    改造洼涝，除害兴利
    对平原涝洼盐碱地的改造，根据我省不同地区的不同条件，也初步摸索到一些经验，渤海海滨的无棣县在大改盐碱地后，摘掉了苦海沿边碱场涝洼的低产帽子，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食指标，昔日盐碱地，今日米粮川。饱受风沙海浪荒碱之苦的日照县涛?人民公社，结合封滩造林，对盐碱滩洼采取了筑坝建闸，挖方筑?的办法，既防止了海浪的侵袭，保护了盐田、农田，又利用了原来碱荒不毛之地进行栽蒲种稻和大量的海产养殖，成为林带望不断，蒲汪片连片，水稻大丰收，渔盐齐发展的鱼米之乡。在滨湖涝洼地区，则有金乡县的以蓄水与调水，河网与机械排灌相结合的河网化经验。在平原洼地，采取河网化的办法确是治水的根本方向。曹县八化一体的河网工程是平原洼涝盐碱地区彻底解决旱、涝、盐碱三害的根本措施，是改变自然面貌最彻底最革命的方法。这一工程的基本特点是：全面规划、综合治理，除害兴利并举，农林牧副渔五业结合，大型工程与小型工程结合，出现了三水（渠、河、井）并用，三害（旱、涝、碱）并除，五业齐兴的崭新面貌。
    水利建设的成就，是毛泽东思想的胜利
    我省水利建设所以取得上述成就，是党中央和毛主席的正确领导的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。在工作实践中我们更深刻地体会到总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三大法宝的绝对正确性和无比的威力。事实充分证明，党的社会主义建设总路线，既充分地表达了我国人民要求迅速改变一穷二白的状况，把我国尽快建成一个社会主义强国的强烈愿望，又正确地反映了我国社会主义建设的客观规律。这条总路线一经为群众所掌握，就产生出无穷无尽的智慧和力量，就能够多快好省的发展我国各项社会主义建设事业。我省在水利建设工作上，正由于贯彻了党的总路线，因而取得了又多、又快、又好、又省的全面大跃进。具有无比优越性和强大生命力的人民公社，也是水利建设全面大跃进的根本保证。如果没有人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，要进行上述大规模的群众性的水利建设，是不可能的。事实还充分证明，党中央所提出的以蓄为主、小型为主、社办为主的水利建设方针，是一条多快好省地发展我国水利事业的唯一正确的方针。大跃进以来，除成千上万的小型水利灌溉工程和治山治涝工程是依靠群众自力兴办的以外，就是一些大中型骨干工程，也是本着社办公助的原则来兴建的。1958年以来，国家投资所举办的工程，所需水泥、钢材、木料等物料，除国家调拨支援的以外，半数以上都是依靠地方和人民公社自筹解决的。
    总之，过去农业社办不到的，而今人民公社办到了。在充分动员和合理使用劳动力方面，人民公社较之高级农业社具有更大的优越性。人民公社不仅为水利建设提供了雄厚的人力和物质条件，更重要的是提高了人们的思想觉悟，培养了人们的共产主义精神，他们不仅本社本县互相协作支援，而且县与县之间，专区与专区之间也掀起了友谊大协作大支援。因此，按常规需要二、三年才能完成的工程，现在七八个月至多一年就可以完成了。人民公社的旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性从水利建设所取得的惊人成就更可以得到充分的证明。
    各位代表，我们的工作还做得很不够，离着实现我省的全部水利规划还有不小的距离，特别是对于争取能够掌握到足够的水源来充分发挥灌溉效益，还有许多工作要做。我们决心在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社所指引的胜利道路，并虚心学习兄弟省的先进经验，继续作不懈的努力。特别当前正遇到严重的春旱，山东全省人民，正以抗旱抗到天低头，滴雨不下保丰收的坚强意志和战斗行动，贯彻执行着省委提出的抗旱保麦，抗旱保种的战斗号召，决心夺取小麦大丰收，打好农业生产战线的第一仗，以圆满实现1960年生产、思想、技术全面大丰收，一定为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要各项指标而奋斗。
