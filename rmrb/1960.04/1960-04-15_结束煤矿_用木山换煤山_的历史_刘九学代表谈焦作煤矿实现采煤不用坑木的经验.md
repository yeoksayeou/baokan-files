Comrades, representatives:

Having listened to the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, I am greatly encouraged and will resolutely implement them. Now I will report to the conference on how Jiao Zuo Coal Mine has achieved coal mining without pit props.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Party committees at all levels, Jiao Zuo Coal mine has conscientiously implemented the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies. In particular, after implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing Rightist tendencies, and exerting great effort to promote the movement to increase production and practice economy, the political consciousness of all employees has greatly improved. Everyone is energetic and full of fighting spirit, and has actively engaged in the movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, with the aim of three highs (high output, high efficiency, high quality), two lows (low cost, low material consumption), and one guarantee (guarantee of safe production). Therefore, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Jiao Zuo Coal Mine achieved another Great Leap Forward in coal production in 1959, overfulfilling the state plan by 11.4%, an increase of 49.23% compared to 1958. In the first quarter of this year, the production plan was completed fifteen days ahead of schedule, and other economic indicators were overfulfilled, achieving comprehensive red and full-house red in various economic indicators.

1960 is a year of greater, better, more comprehensive, and sustained leap forward. According to the state plan, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the requirements of "high output, low consumption, and large-scale saving of pit props" to all employees of Jiao Zuo Coal Mine. Therefore, while ensuring sustained high production, vigorously saving pit props has become an urgent task for all our employees. The miners of Jiao Zuo Coal Mine actively responded to the call of the Party, vigorously engaged in technical revolution, launched a mass movement, relied on their own efforts, and reformed coal mining methods, widely using substitutes, so that pit prop consumption decreased significantly. The overall pit prop consumption of the bureau decreased from 28.28 cubic meters per thousand tons of coal from January to October last year to 18.21 cubic meters in December, and further decreased to below 16 cubic meters in the first quarter of this year. Moreover, a no-pit-prop mine and eight no-pit-prop work faces have already emerged. The history of these units "exchanging wooden mountains for coal mountains" is gone forever. At present, the miners are fighting heroically to realize a no-pit-prop bureau (mining bureau) as a gift for the "Eleventh" (National Day).

How did Jiao Zuo Coal Mine achieve less use and no use of pit props in coal mining?

I. Give prominence to politics, oppose Rightist tendencies, liberate thinking, and march toward coal mining without pit props. With the development of socialist construction, the demand for pit props is increasing day by day. The Municipal Party Committee proposed to the miners the goal of marching toward coal mining without pit props and realizing no-pit-prop work faces and no-pit-prop mines. The broad masses of employees actively responded to this call. However, a few comrades, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of saving pit props and a lack of communist style, supported it verbally but were not active in action. Some simply had no confidence, saying, "Coal mines have always exchanged wooden mountains for coal mountains. If you want to mine coal without pit props, unless the wind blows loess and the coal is exposed in the open." Among engineering and technical personnel, there are also various Right-leaning conservative ideas about realizing no-pit-prop coal mining. They emphasize the objective, emphasize the difficulties, fear that saving pit props will affect production, fear insecurity, saying, "Jiao Zuo has many old mines, many roadways, and much harvesting, and pit props cannot be reduced," "Slag pillars, ceramsite pillars, and substitutes do not have strong pressure resistance, and safety is not guaranteed," etc. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, they do not pay attention to pit prop recovery and do not actively use substitutes, resulting in pit prop overspending. The vast majority of our employees are extremely dissatisfied with this phenomenon, and have written big-character posters, let loose, and debated extensively, launching a mass movement to investigate waste, calculate harm, and find reasons. At the same time, they held mass activities such as "pit prop grievance meetings," "pit prop accusations," and pit prop saving exhibitions, which universally improved ideological awareness, basically enabling each employee to know four things: first, knowing that pit props are hard-won; second, knowing that the country lacks timber; third, knowing that saving pit props is a concrete implementation of the General Line; and fourth, knowing that everyone is responsible for saving pit props. Thus, they laid the foundation of confidence and determination to reduce pit prop consumption and realize coal mining without pit props. Employees wrote more than 10,000 letters of determination, challenge letters, and response letters, creating a mass upsurge in pit prop saving where every mine has a plan, every district has measures, everyone expresses determination, and everyone writes a guarantee. The employees of the West Han Wang Mine put forward the slogan: "All employees mobilize, work hard and skillfully to break the key; resolutely achieve no pit props (mine), create miracles and offer gifts," and achieved a no-pit-prop mine by the end of February this year. The Dongfeng team of Wangfeng Mine, the Red Flag coal mining team of Lizhuang Mine, the May Fourth Youth coal mining team of Lifeng Mine, and our coal mining team, and other eight work faces have all realized coal mining without pit props. Facts have proved that to revolutionize pit props, we must first carry out ideological revolution and ensure that all employees establish the idea of daring to climb the innovation of coal mining without pit props.

II. Large-scale publicity and mobilization, launching a mass movement. Under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the communist style, communist labor attitude, and communist spirit of cooperation of all employees of Jiao Zuo Coal Mine have been greatly improved. Thinking for socialism and saving a large amount of pit props has become a consistent action of all employees. Workers actively used various forms, such as clapper talks, cross talks, big-character posters, and storytelling, to publicize the great significance of saving pit props, creating momentum for saving pit props, and forming a climax where everyone supervises waste and everyone saves pit props. In order to enable the mine's fixed roadways to quickly use brick piers, all employees of Wangfeng Mine launched a 10,000-brick movement. From direct workers to auxiliary workers, from workers to cadres, they used their spare time to carry green bricks and build 230,000 brick piers. Some family members also actively requested to participate in manufacturing slag pillars in factories to save pit props. In West Han Wang Mine alone, more than 50 family members participated in the pit prop processing plant. In this way, a total of five slag pillar factories were established one after another, and some even established amateur green brick processing plants, lime factories, crushed wood processing plants, etc., making do with whatever was available and using local materials to manufacture a large number of pit prop substitutes. Practice has proved that using the mass movement method to manufacture substitutes is the guarantee for realizing a no-pit-prop mine.

III. Tackle key problems, break through strongholds, and engage in large-scale technical revolution. In the pit prop saving movement, the broad masses of employees, with the liberation of heavy physical labor and the saving of pit props as the main attack direction, actively offered ideas, suggested methods, made suggestions, engaged in innovation, tackled key problems, and broke through strongholds. Since 1959, the masses of employees, focusing on realizing no-pit-prop mines, reforming coal mining methods, and fully utilizing substitutes, have put forward 325,103 rationalization proposals, of which 200,541 have been realized. In reforming coal mining methods, the employees of the Dongfeng team of Wangfeng Mine created a multi-head funnel-type one-time full-height mining method, which the masses call the "Dongfeng-style" mining method, with an average daily output consolidating to more than 1,000 tons, and pit prop consumption dropping from 27 cubic meters/thousand tons to 4.43 cubic meters/thousand tons. The Lizhuang Mine successfully tested the checkerboard mining method, which the employees call the "Red Flag-style coal mining method," with pit prop consumption decreasing from 22 cubic meters/thousand tons in the past to 11.4 cubic meters/thousand tons. All mines with suitable conditions have promoted hydraulic mining. Since the beginning of this year, the number of water mining and water transportation, dry mining and water transportation work faces and tunneling faces has increased by 1.5 times compared with the past, and pit prop consumption has been reduced by 70% compared with dry mining work faces. In October last year, after engineering and technical personnel and worker masses combined to successfully create slag pillars, each mine quickly promoted it. Coal mining work faces and tunneling faces use slag pillars, connecting pillars, ceramsite pillars, wattle beams, fixed transportation ventilation rolls use brick pier pillars, cement beams, rubble spins, pressure-resistant beams, bolt supports, etc. There are about thirty kinds. Statistics from this quarter alone show that the use of substitutes saved 6,879 cubic meters of pit props. Practice has proved that vigorously engaging in technical revolution, reforming coal mining methods, and widely utilizing substitutes are the fundamental ways to realize a no-pit-prop mine.

IV. The combination of leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and workers is an infinite force. Leaders at all levels of Jiao Zuo Coal Mine attach great importance to realizing no-pit-prop coal mining. Each mine has established a technical revolution committee to specifically lead this work. Leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel directly promoted various advanced experiences and solved many key problems. After the successful creation of slag pillars, a large number of them were manufactured. The Municipal Party Committee instructed other machinery factories to manufacture ball mills, which were quickly resolved. Comrade Lu Zhengming, Secretary of the Wangfeng Mine Party Committee, always studied and experimented with the Dongfeng mining method with the masses, mobilizing the masses to offer ideas and suggestions, and solved more than 50 problems. For example, slag pillars are relatively easy to break. Lu Zhengming personally convened a "Zhuge Liang" meeting with the participation of technical personnel and workers to study the method of adopting paired pillars and to use slag pillars in conjunction with wooden pillars, brick piers, and metal pillars to increase pressure resistance and avoid blasting collapses, ensuring the use of substitutes. It can be seen that the process of promoting new pit props is the process of testing, summarizing, promoting, re-testing, re-summarizing, and re-promoting. The success of an innovation project is the result of a three-way combination.

V. Improve management and organize the leap forward. With the large-scale use of pit prop substitutes, new technologies will be incorporated into the rules and regulations, and corresponding reforms will be carried out in management work, such as pit prop substitute manufacturing regulations, substitute management systems, and substitute operating procedures, adding new chapters to the rules and regulations. At the same time, the material management has been improved, the system of supplying and approving materials according to plan has been strictly implemented, and post-shift dynamic analysis meetings and roof management committees have been established, which have played a certain role in consolidating the achievements and realizing a no-pit-prop mine.

Although Jiao Zuo Coal Mine has achieved some success in saving pit props, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements. We will continue to hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, continue to oppose Rightist tendencies, boost our energy, establish ambitions, and make great efforts to engage in technical innovation, striving to realize a no-pit-prop bureau by "Eleventh" (National Day). Our battle slogan is: "All employees mobilize, hold high the red flag and rush forward, work hard and skillfully in 1960, break through the cutting edge and greatly exceed production, realize no pit props in the overall situation, and offer gifts on National Day."

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and the representatives good health.

    结束煤矿“用木山换煤山”的历史
    刘九学代表谈焦作煤矿实现采煤不用坑木的经验各位代表：
    听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告，对我鼓舞很大，并坚决贯彻执行，现我把焦作煤矿如何实现采煤不用坑木的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    焦作煤矿在党中央和毛主席以及各级党委的正确领导下，认真地贯彻执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，特别是贯彻了党的八届八中全会的决议，反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动以后，全体职工的政治思想觉悟有很大提高，人人精神奋发，个个斗志昂扬，积极投入了以技术革新和技术革命为中心，以三高（产量高、效率高、质量高）两低（成本低、材料消耗低）、一保证（保证安全生产）为目的增产节约运动。因此，焦作煤矿在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了1959年煤炭生产大跃进，超额11.4％完成了国家计划，比1958年增长49.23％。今年第一季度又提前十五天完成了产量计划，其他经济指标都超额完成了任务，获得各项经济指标全面红、满堂红。
    1960年是更大、更好、更全面持续跃进的的一年。根据国家的计划，市委向焦作煤矿全体职工提出“高产量、低消耗、大量节约坑木”的要求。因此，要在保证持续高产的同时，大力节约坑木，就成为我们全体职工的迫切任务，焦作煤矿的矿工们，积极响应了党的号召，大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动，自力更生，改革采煤方法，广泛利用代用品，使坑木消耗显著下降。全局坑木消耗量由去年1至10月份的千吨煤二十八点二八立方米，12月份即降为十八点二一立方米，今年第一季又降到十六立方米以下，而且已经出现了一个无坑木矿井和八个无坑木工作面。这些单位“木山换煤山”的历史已经一去不复返了。目前矿工们正在为实现无坑木局（矿务局）向“十一”献礼，而英勇奋斗。
    焦作煤矿是如何实现采煤少用坑木和不用坑木的呢？
    一、政治挂帅，反掉右倾，解放思想，向采煤不用坑木进军。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，坑木的需要量日益增多，市委向矿工们提出向采煤不用坑木的目标进军，实现无坑木工作面和无坑木矿井。广大职工积极响应了这一号召。但少数同志，由于对节约坑木的意义认识不足，缺乏共产主义风格，口头上拥护，行动却不积极，有的根本没有信心，他们说：“煤矿自古以来是木山换煤山，要想采煤不用坑木除非风刮黄土煤露天”。在工程技术人员中，对实现无坑木采煤也存在着形形色色的右倾保守思想。他们强调客观，强调困难，怕节约坑木影响生产，怕不安全，说：“焦作老矿井多，巷道多，收获多，坑木不能降低”，“炉渣柱，陶粒柱，代用品抗压力不强，安全没有保证”等。在这种思想指导下，不注意坑木回收，不积极利用代用品，造成坑木超支。我们绝大多数职工同志，对这样现象极为不满，纷纷写大字报，大鸣大放、大辩论，开展了群众性的查浪费，算危害、找原因，同时举办“坑木诉苦”、“坑木告状”，以及节约坑木展览会等群众活动，普遍提高了思想觉悟，基本上使每个职工达到了四知道：一知道坑木来之不易；二知道国家缺少木材；三知道节省坑木就是具体执行总路线；四知道节约坑木人人有责。从而，奠定了降低坑木消耗，实现采煤不用坑木的信心与决心，职工写出决心书、挑战书和应战书一万余张，出现了矿矿有规划，区区有措施，人人表决心，个个写保证的群众性节约坑木高潮。西韩王矿职工提出：“全体职工总动员，大干巧干破关键；坚决实现无坑木（矿井），创造奇迹把礼献”的口号，于今年2月底实现了无坑木矿井。王封矿东风队李庄矿红旗采煤队，李封矿五四青年采煤队和我们的采煤队等八个工作面都实现了采煤不用坑木。事实证明，要革掉坑木的命，必须首先思想革命，必须使全体职工都树立敢于攀登采煤不用坑木这革新的思想。
    二、大宣传大发动，大搞群众运动。焦作煤矿在市委的直接领导下，全体职工的共产主义风格、共产主义劳动态度、共产主义协作精神大大提高，为社会主义着想，大量节省坑木已成为全体职工一致的行动。工人们积极地利用各种形式，如快板，相声，大字报，说唱等，宣传节省坑木的重大意义，造成了节约坑木的声势，形成了人人监督浪费现象，人人节省坑木的高潮。王封矿全体职工，为了使全矿固定性巷道很快使用砖垛，开展了万块砖运动，从直接工到辅助工，从工人到干部，都利用业余时间搬运青砖，搞砖垛二十三万块。有的家属也积极要求到工厂参加制造炉渣柱，节省坑木，仅西韩王矿就有五十多名家属参加坑木加工厂。这样先后共建立炉渣支柱厂五个，有的还建立了业余青砖加工厂、石灰厂、碎木加工厂等，因陋就简，就地取材，大量制造了坑木代用品。实践证明，运用群众运动的方法，制造代用品是实现无坑木矿的保证。
    三、攻关键，破堡垒，大搞技术革命。在节约坑木运动中，广大职工以解放笨重体力劳动和节约坑木为主攻方向，积极出主意想办法，献计策，闹革新，攻关键，破堡垒。1959年以来，职工群众围绕实现无坑木矿，改革采煤方法和充分利用代用品两大关键，提出合理化建议三十二万五千一百零三条，已经实现二十万零五百四十一条。在改革采煤方法上，王封矿东风队的职工创造了多头漏斗式一次采全高，群众把它叫做“东风式”采煤法，平均日产巩固到一千吨以上，坑木消耗由二十七立方米／千吨降为四点四三立方米／千吨。李庄矿试验成功了格子采煤法，职工称它为“红旗式采煤法”坑木消耗，由过去二十二立方米／千吨，降为十一点四立方米／千吨。各矿有条件的都推广了水力采煤。今年以来水采水运、旱采水运的工作面和掘进头，较过去增加一点五倍，坑木消耗比旱采工作面降低70％。去年10月间，工程技术人员和工人群众相结合，创造成功炉渣柱后，各矿迅速推广，采煤工作面和掘进头使用炉渣柱，接头柱，陶粒柱，荆条梁，固定性运输通风卷运用砖垛柱、洋灰梁、片石旋、耐压梁、螺栓支架等约有三十余种。仅今年一季统计就利用代用品节约坑木六千八百七十九立方米。实践证明，大闹技术革命，改革采煤方法，广泛利用代用品，是实现无坑木矿的根本途径。
    四、领导、工程技术人员和工人三结合力量无穷。焦作煤矿的各级领导，对实现无坑木采煤，非常重视，各矿都建立了技术革命委员会，专门领导这一工作。领导干部和工程技术人员，直接推广各种先进经验，解决了很多关键问题，炉渣支柱成功后，大量制造，需要球磨机，市委指示其他机械工厂制造，很快就得到了解决，王封矿党委书记路正明同志，始终和群众一道研究试验东风采煤法，发动群众献计献策，解决了五十多个问题。如炉渣柱比较容易折断，路正明就亲自召集有技术人员和工人参加的“诸葛亮”会，研究采取打对柱的办法，并把炉渣柱和木柱、砖垛、金属柱配合使用，增加了耐压强度，避免了放炮打翻棚，保证了代用品的使用。由此可见，推广新坑木的过程，就是试验、总结、推广，再试验、再总结、再推广的过程，一个革新项目的成功都是三结合的结果。
    五、改进管理，组织跃进。随着坑木代用品的大量使用，将出现的新技术纳入了规章制度，在管理工作上相应地进行改革，如坑木代用品制造规程，代用品管理制度，使用代用品操作规程等，给规章制度增加了新章。同时改进了材料管理，严格执行材料按计划供应和审批制度，建立班后动态分析会，顶板管理委员会等，对巩固取得的成绩，实现无坑木矿起了一定的作用。
    焦作煤矿在节约坑木方面，虽取得了一些成绩，但是，我们决不满足已有的成就，我们要继续高举党的总路线和毛泽东思想红旗，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，树雄心，立大志，大闹技术革新，力争“十一”实现无坑木局而奋斗。我们的战斗口号是：“全体职工总动员，高举红旗冲向前，大干巧干60年，攻破尖端大超产，全局实现无坑木，国庆节日把礼献”。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，祝代表身体健康。
