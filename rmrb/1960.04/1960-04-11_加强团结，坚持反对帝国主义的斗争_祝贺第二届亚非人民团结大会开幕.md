    Strengthen Unity and Adhere to the Struggle Against Imperialism
    ——Congratulations on the Opening of the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference
    Today, the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, attended by more than 270 delegates from over 70 countries, solemnly opens in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea in Black Africa. The conference will discuss the thorough eradication of imperialism and colonialism in Asia and Africa, African and Afro-Asian solidarity, and other major issues of common concern to the peoples of Asia and Africa. This is a grand gathering of Afro-Asian people's great unity. In his congratulatory message to the conference, Premier Zhou Enlai wholeheartedly wished the conference "to further strengthen and consolidate the friendly unity of the Asian and African peoples on the basis of promoting the Bandung spirit, and to make greater contributions to the cause of national independence movements and the defense of world peace." The representatives of all circles in the Chinese capital held a meeting in Beijing on March 24, 1960, to support the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference Day. The meeting passed a resolution stating that the Chinese people "wish the conference to make new contributions to further promoting the Bandung spirit, strengthening the unity of the Asian and African peoples, promoting national independence movements, and safeguarding the cause of world peace." Premier Zhou Enlai's congratulatory message and the resolution of this meeting express the ardent wishes of the 600 million Chinese people for the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference. The Chinese people, together with the Asian and African peoples, celebrate the convening of the conference and look forward to its success with great excitement.
    The First Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, held more than two years ago, was a continuation of the historic Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries. Its achievement lies in following and further developing the Bandung spirit and formulating a program of action for the united action of the Asian and African peoples. The conference declared that the ambitions of imperialism lead to aggression and interference, leading to wars of aggression and enslavement, and that "the continued existence of imperialism is incompatible with the new era in which the world finds itself." The conference solemnly condemned imperialism and colonialism, demanded recognition of the full independence rights of all colonies and protectorates, and reaffirmed that the peoples of Asia and Africa resolutely support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. From the First to the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, its permanent body has carried out active activities to implement the spirit of the conference's resolutions. Under the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and its Secretariat, the peoples of Asia and Africa actively launched activities to protest against the US military aggression against Lebanon and the British military aggression against Jordan, and to support the Iraqi revolution; to protest against the British suppression of the atrocities of the people in the southern Arabian Peninsula; to hold "Vietnam Day" and "Korea Day" to support the Vietnamese people's struggle to uphold the Geneva Accords and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and to demand that the US troops immediately withdraw from South Korea; to support the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty"; to condemn the United States and the Lao authorities for seriously undermining the Geneva Accords; and also held "Anti-Military Treaty Day" to strongly condemn the US imperialism's aggressive bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan; to condemn the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, and so on. Under the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and its Secretariat, the peoples of Asia and Africa gave particularly deep sympathy and strong support to the African national independence movement. The Asian and African peoples held "African Freedom Day," "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," "Algeria Day," "Cameroon Day," "Congo Day," "Uganda Day," "Equatorial Africa Day," etc., and promptly supported the struggle of the people of Central Africa, South Africa, and Ruanda-Urundi against colonialism and racial discrimination. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council also called for the holding of a joint action day for international opposition to atomic and hydrogen bombs and for disarmament, and held a conference protesting France's nuclear tests in Africa. All these actions greatly encouraged and promoted the national liberation struggle of the Asian and African peoples and the cause of unity of the Asian and African peoples.
    Now, as the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference opens, the situation in Asia, Africa, and the entire world is further developing in a direction conducive to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and colonialism. The East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown unprecedentedly, and the imperialist war and colonial forces have been further weakened. The national independence movement and the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging higher than ever. Especially in Africa, ten African countries have already gained independent status. Algeria has established a provisional government. Since 1959, in addition to the Algerian people in North Africa holding high the banner of national independence, the people of West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa have all ignited the torch of freedom. The convening of the two All-African People's Conferences in 1958 and 1959 more vividly marked the great awakening and unity of the African people. The upsurge of the African people's opposition to colonialism and struggle for national independence has fundamentally shaken the imperialist colonial system. It is clear that the convening of this Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry, the capital of the newly emerging independent country of the Republic of Guinea in Black Africa, will have particularly significant meaning for further supporting the African national independence movement and promoting the liberation of the African people from the colonial system.
    Today, imperialists and colonialists are still carrying out frenzied counterattacks and attacks on the national liberation movements and Afro-Asian peace in the Asia-Africa region. In Asia, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, the tools of US imperialism's aggression against the Far East and the Middle East, are stepping up their plotting of new aggression and interference conspiracies. US imperialism continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan; in South Vietnam and Laos, it is carrying out intervention activities, undermining the Geneva Accords, and endangering peace in Indochina; in South Korea, it refuses to withdraw US aggressive troops; and it is transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and South Korea. The United States and the Japanese reactionaries have concluded a new US-Japan military alliance, actively preparing for a new war of aggression in the East. In Africa, Western imperialism still possesses nearly a million colonial troops and police, carrying out bloody suppression of the people in African colonies. In Algeria, the dirty colonial war launched by the French colonialists continues. In Central Africa and East Africa, British colonialists are carrying out various deceptive conspiracies; in West Africa and Equatorial Africa, French colonialists are using the so-called "Community" to put new colonial shackles on the people of the colonies; in the Belgian Congo, Belgian colonialists are still playing various tricks to obstruct the Congolese people from gaining true independence. In South Africa, white rulers are massacring unarmed Africans. In the Sahara, French imperialism has also repeatedly exploded nuclear devices. US imperialism, the most adept at disguise and the most dangerous enemy, is expanding to Africa in a big way from various aspects such as politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. On the one hand, US imperialism continues to maintain aggressive troops and military bases in Africa, and does its best to support other colonial countries' armed suppression of the people in African colonies; on the other hand, it pretends to sympathize with the African people's desire for independence, so that it can intervene and replace the old colonial countries. It is very clear that the imperialist colonial policy has not changed, but has become more vicious and insidious. Therefore, the peoples of Asian and African countries must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and carry out the struggle for independence, freedom, and peace to the end.
    Now, imperialism is trying its best to provoke and undermine the unity within the Asian and African peoples and between the peoples of various countries, especially to provoke and undermine the unity between socialist countries and Afro-Asian nationalist countries. However, this conspiracy of imperialism will never succeed. Any disputes between Asian and African countries can be resolved through friendly consultations in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit. The peoples of Asian and African countries have common interests in maintaining and striving for independence, in defending peace, and in developing the national economies of various countries. We should not only unite and be friendly, but we can also unite and be friendly. The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the struggle of the peoples of Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism, and resolutely supported the great cause of unity and cooperation of the Asian and African peoples. We believe that the grand gathering of Afro-Asian people's great unity being held in Conakry will further illuminate the path forward for the Asian and African peoples. The Asian and African peoples' struggle for independence, freedom, and peace will surely continue to achieve new victories!

    加强团结，坚持反对帝国主义的斗争
    ——祝贺第二届亚非人民团结大会开幕
    今天，有七十多个国家二百七十多名代表参加的第二届亚非人民团结大会，在黑非洲几内亚共和国的首都科纳克里隆重地开幕了。大会将要讨论在亚非两洲彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义、非洲和亚非团结以及其他为亚非人民所共同关心的重大问题。这是一次亚非人民大团结的盛会。我国周恩来总理在致大会的贺电中衷心地祝贺大会“在发扬万隆精神的基础上，进一步加强和巩固亚非人民的友好团结，并且为民族独立运动和保卫世界和平的事业作出更重大的贡献。”1960年3月24日中国首都各界代表在北京举行的支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日的大会曾通过决议指出，中国人民“预祝大会对进一步发扬万隆精神，加强亚非人民的团结，促进民族独立运动以及保卫世界和平的事业，作出新的贡献。”周恩来总理的贺电和这个会议的决议表达了六亿中国人民对于第二届亚非人民团结大会所抱的热烈的愿望。中国人民和亚非人民一道，同声庆贺大会的召开，并以十分兴奋的心情预祝大会获得成功。
    两年多以前召开的第一届亚非人民团结大会是历史性的亚非国家万隆会议的继续，它的功绩在于遵循和进一步发展了万隆精神，制定了亚非人民团结一致的行动纲领。大会宣布，帝国主义的野心导致侵略和干涉行为，导致侵略和奴役战争，“帝国主义的继续存在和现在世界所处的新时代是不相容的。”大会严正地谴责帝国主义和殖民主义，要求承认一切殖民地和保护国的完全独立的权利，并重申亚非各国人民坚决拥护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则。从第一届到第二届亚非人民团结大会，它的常设机构为贯彻大会决议的精神进行了积极的活动。在亚非人民团结理事会及其书记处的号召下，亚非人民积极展开活动，抗议美军侵略黎巴嫩和英军侵略约旦，并支持伊拉克革命；抗议英国镇压阿拉伯半岛南部人民的暴行；举行了“越南日”、“朝鲜日”，支持越南人民维护日内瓦协议、争取祖国和平统一的斗争，并要求美国军队立即撤出南朝鲜；支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争；谴责美国和老挝当局严重破坏日内瓦协议；还举行了“反对军事条约日”，强烈谴责美国帝国主义同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订的侵略性双边军事协定；谴责东南亚条约集团干涉印度尼西亚内政等等。在亚非人民团结理事会及其书记处的号召下，亚非各国人民对于非洲民族独立运动给予了特别深切的同情和有力的支持。亚非人民举行了“非洲自由日”、“帝国主义滚出非洲日”、“阿尔及利亚日”、“喀麦隆日”、“刚果日”、“乌干达日”、“赤道非洲日”等等，并及时地支持了中非、南非和卢安达—乌隆迪人民反对殖民主义和种族歧视的斗争。亚非人民团结理事会还号召举行了国际反对原子弹氢弹和争取裁军共同行动日，举行了抗议法国在非洲进行核试验的大会。所有这些行动大大地鼓舞和推动了亚非人民的民族解放斗争和亚非人民的团结事业。
    现在，当第二届亚非人民团结大会开幕之际，亚洲、非洲和整个世界的形势正进一步朝着有利于各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的方向发展。东风继续压倒西风。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前壮大，帝国主义战争和殖民势力进一步被削弱了。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动和民族民主运动一浪高似一浪。特别是在非洲，已经有十个非洲国家获得了独立地位。阿尔及利亚成立了临时政府。1959年以来，除了北非洲的阿尔及利亚人民高举民族独立的大旗以外，西非、中非、东非和南非人民都燃起了自由的火炬。1960年，又将有包括尼日利亚、刚果在内的近六千万人口的一系列非洲国家摆脱殖民统治而走上独立的道路。1958年和1959年两届全非人民大会的召开，更鲜明地标志了非洲人民的伟大的觉醒和团结。非洲人民反对殖民主义，争取民族独立运动的高涨，已经从根本上震撼了帝国主义的殖民体系。很显然，本届亚非人民团结大会在黑非洲新兴的独立国家几内亚共和国的首都召开，对于进一步支持非洲民族独立运动和促进非洲人民从殖民制度下解放出来，将具有特别重大的意义。
    帝国主义和殖民主义者今天仍在亚非地区向各国人民的民族解放运动和亚非和平进行疯狂的反扑和进攻。在亚洲，美帝国主义侵略远东和中近东的工具东南亚条约集团和中央条约组织正在加紧策划着新的侵略和干涉阴谋。美国帝国主义继续霸占着中国的领土台湾；在南越和老挝，进行着干涉活动，破坏日内瓦协议，危害印度支那的和平；在南朝鲜，拒绝撤退美国侵略军；并把核武器运进日本、南朝鲜。美国和日本反动派缔结了新的日美军事同盟，积极在东方准备着新的侵略战争。而在非洲，西方帝国主义仍然拥有近百万的殖民军队和警察，对非洲殖民地人民进行着血腥的镇压。在阿尔及利亚，法国殖民者发动的肮脏的殖民战争仍在继续着。在中非、东非，英国殖民主义者正在进行着各种欺骗阴谋；在西非和赤道非洲，法国殖民主义者用所谓“共同体”的新的殖民枷锁套在殖民地人民的头上；在比属刚果，比利时殖民主义者仍在玩弄各种诡计，以阻挠刚果人民获得真正的独立。在南非，白人统治者正在屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人。在撒哈拉，法国帝国主义还接连地爆炸了核装置。美国帝国主义这个最善于伪装、也是最危险的敌人正从政治、军事、经济、文化等各个方面大举向非洲扩张。美国帝国主义一面在非洲继续保持着侵略军队和军事基地，并且竭力支持其它殖民国家对非洲殖民地人民的武装镇压；一面又伪装同情非洲人民的独立愿望，以便于它插足进去，取旧殖民国家的地位而代之。事情很明白，帝国主义的殖民侵略政策仍然没有改变，而是更加恶毒和阴险了，因此亚非各国人民必须提高警惕，加强团结，把争取独立自由和保卫和平的斗争进行到底。
    现在帝国主义正在千方百计地挑拨和破坏亚非各国人民内部以及各国人民相互之间的团结，特别是挑拨和破坏社会主义国家和亚非民族主义国家的团结。但是，帝国主义的这个阴谋是决不能得逞的。亚非各国之间的任何争端，都可以根据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，通过友好协商加以解决。亚非各国人民在维护和争取独立，在保卫和平，在发展各国民族经济方面，有着共同的利益。我们不但应该团结友好，而且完全可以团结友好。中国人民从来都坚决支持亚非各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，坚决支持亚非人民团结合作的伟大事业。我们相信，正在科纳克里举行的亚非人民大团结的盛会必将进一步照亮亚非人民前进的道路。亚非人民为争取独立、自由与和平的斗争一定会不断获得新的胜利！
