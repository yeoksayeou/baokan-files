Planting More and Managing Well: Sugarcane

    Xinhua News Agency reported: Guangdong Province, a major sugarcane producing area, has now planted more than 2.2 million mu of sugarcane, exceeding the original planting plan and expanding the actual harvested area by more than 80% compared with last year, and 15% more than 1958, the year with the most sugarcane planted in history. The newly planted sugarcane is now more than a foot tall and growing vigorously, and the ratoon cane is more than three feet tall. At present, various regions are focusing on field management, trying every means to increase yield per unit area.
    Actively expanding sugarcane planting area is an important measure for Guangdong Province to strive for a bumper sugarcane harvest this year. This year's great leap forward in water conservancy work in the province has created extremely favorable conditions for expanding sugarcane planting area. In the past, Guangdong's sugarcane areas were concentrated in the Pearl River Delta and the Chaoshan Plain. This year, with the changes in the water conservancy landscape of Zhanjiang and Hainan, two regions with large areas of wasteland, new sugarcane planting bases have been established in these two regions. Zhanjiang Prefecture has planted 700,000 mu of sugarcane this year, catching up with Foshan Prefecture, the largest old sugarcane area in the province. Hainan Island has also planted more than 290,000 mu of sugarcane, which is 50,000 mu more than the Chaoshan area.
    Xinhua News Agency reported: Under the guidance of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," Guangxi is experiencing a continued leap forward in sugarcane production. According to statistics, as of April 17, the total sugarcane planting area in the entire autonomous region has reached 1.06 million mu (including 350,000 mu of ratoon cane), exceeding last year's planting area by 43%. Many sugarcane seedlings are as tall as two or three feet, and the view is a sea of green. As of April 15, 48% of the sugarcane fields in the region had undergone the first topdressing and soil cultivation. More than 300,000 mu of ratoon cane have undergone the second cultivation and soil improvement.
    Xinhua News Agency reported: People's communes in the sugarcane producing areas of Fujian are further developing sugarcane production this year. As of now, the area planted with sugarcane in the province has expanded by about 30% compared with last year. In order to realize the planting plan of "planting more, producing high yields, and harvesting more," in addition to reclaiming large areas of wasteland to expand sugarcane planting area, communes in various regions have also widely promoted improved varieties such as Taiwan Sugar "134" and Java "3016." The area of improved sugarcane varieties in the province accounts for more than 90% of the total area. Xianyou, Quanzhou, Yunxiao, Pinghe and other counties and cities, the main sugarcane producing areas, have achieved full planting of improved varieties. (Attached picture)

    甘蔗种得多管得好
    据新华社讯　蔗糖主要产区的广东省现已种下甘蔗二百二十多万亩，超额完成了原订种植计划，比去年实收面积扩大80％以上，比历史上种蔗最多的1958年也多15％。新植蔗现在已长到一尺多高，长势旺盛，宿根蔗已有三尺多高。目前各地正大抓田间管理，千方百计提高单位面积产量。
    积极扩大甘蔗种植面积，是广东省争取今年甘蔗大丰收的一项重要措施。今年全省水利工作大跃进，为扩大甘蔗种植面积创造了极为良好的条件。广东省的蔗区过去集中在珠江三角洲和潮汕平原，今年随着湛江和海南这两个有着大片荒地的地区水利面貌的改变，新的甘蔗种植基地已在这两个地区建立起来。湛江专区今年已种下甘蔗七十万亩，种植面积赶上了全省最大的老蔗区——佛山专区。海南岛也已种下甘蔗二十九万多亩，比潮汕地区还多五万亩。
    据新华社讯　广西各地在“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针指导下，甘蔗生产又出现了持续跃进的局面。据统计，到4月17日止，全自治区甘蔗播种面积已达一百零六万亩（其中宿根蔗三十五万亩），超过去年播种面积43％。很多蔗苗长达二、三尺高，举目远眺，一片油绿。到4月15日止，全区蔗田已有48％进行了第一次追肥培土。三十多万亩宿根蔗有的已进行第二次中耕培土。
    据新华社讯　福建甘蔗产区各人民公社今年进一步发展甘蔗生产。截至目前，全省已种的甘蔗面积，比去年扩大30％左右。为了实现“多种高产多收”的种植计划，各地公社除垦复大批荒地扩大甘蔗种植面积外，并普遍推广了台糖“一三四”、爪哇“三○一六”等良种，全省良种甘蔗面积占总面积90％以上，甘蔗主要产地仙游、泉州、云霄、平和等县市已做到全面栽植良种。（附图片）
