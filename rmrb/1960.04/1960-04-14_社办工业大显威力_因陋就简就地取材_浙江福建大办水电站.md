Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th: In Zhejiang Province, people's communes everywhere are vigorously developing rural hydropower stations and water-powered stations, and the speed of construction is accelerating. In the first quarter of this year alone, the province completed 206 rural hydropower stations, with an installed capacity of 5,982 kilowatts, equivalent to 1.07 times the total installed capacity of rural hydropower stations in the province last year. It also completed 6,853 water-powered stations, with 52,265 horsepower, a sharp increase of 11.6 times compared to the total number of stations built throughout last year.

In the movement to vigorously develop hydropower and water-powered stations, the broad masses of cadres and people, giving full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, adopted methods of making the most of simple conditions and using local materials, overcoming difficulties such as the lack of equipment. For example, the more than 20 hydropower and water-powered stations built in Sheng County all used wood instead of steel, solving the shortage of steel shafts, bearings, steel pipes, and iron hoops. These stations have been operating well since their completion and are very popular among the masses. The Baofu Commune hydropower station in Anji County, lacking a generator, used a 7-kilowatt motor and a 30-kilowatt generator from the Yangshuling hydropower station in parallel operation. The motor, replacing the generator, required neither capacitors nor parallel connection equipment, making it easy to operate and effective. The Tangpu Commune used a drop of 20 centimeters to build a tubular flow velocity hydropower station. In general river network areas, as long as there is a stream with a bit of flow velocity, putting on a wooden tubular flow turbine can be used to build a station for power generation, setting an example for station construction in the plains. Jinyun County summarized and promoted the experience of the Jinyun Oil Factory in converting old water-powered mortars into water-powered stations to achieve continuous production, and launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement throughout the county, centered on fully utilizing water power and reforming processing tools. In just two or three months, more than 260 old water-powered mortars and 15 oil factories in the county had realized continuous operation of all seven or eight production items such as rice milling, flour grinding, oil pressing, and feed crushing.

Zhejiang Province began utilizing water power a long time ago. Since 1958, 733 hydropower stations and 7,264 water-powered stations have been built in rural areas throughout the province. The completion of these rural hydropower and water-powered stations has played a huge role in promoting the technical transformation of agriculture and the development of commune-run industries. For example, the Huling Commune in Ruian County vigorously developed water-powered stations, comprehensively utilizing 158 water-powered mortars, equivalent to 176 horsepower. The proportion of mechanization and semi-mechanization in commune-run industries increased from less than 18% to 73.18%, saving more than 140,000 labor days throughout the year. In addition, five water-powered mortars were used to generate electricity, bringing electric lights to the mountainous areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th: People's communes in rural Fujian Province are fully utilizing water resources to vigorously develop water power and hydropower construction, and in the past three months, more than 9,260 small water-powered stations have been built and put into production (more than 2.5 times the total number of stations built in the years since liberation), with a total of more than 51,800 horsepower. More than 180 small hydropower stations have been built, with a total installed capacity of more than 3,590 kilowatts. Adding to the construction in the years since liberation, the province now has more than 12,600 water-powered stations and more than 640 small hydropower stations, averaging more than 17 water-powered stations and more than one hydropower station per commune.

These small hydropower and water-powered stations built using indigenous methods are all highly efficient. The more than 760 water-powered stations in Yong'an County drive a total of 1,450 rice milling, rice hulling, and sawing machines, averaging nearly two machines per station, basically realizing the mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing. These water-powered stations have processed more than 43 million catties of grain, 55 million catties of feed, and 5,000 cubic meters of timber in 100 days, saving one million labor days. The Rexi Management Area of the Hongtian Commune converted an old water-powered mortar into a water-powered station, driving a No. 3 rice milling machine. In just over three months, it has processed 600,000 catties of grain and more than 100,000 catties of feed.

Fujian Province has overlapping mountains and more than 600 large and small rivers, with a large natural drop, which is extremely favorable for the development of water power and hydropower. This year, various localities have generally summarized the experience of establishing small water power and hydropower stations and further strengthened leadership. Many leading cadres and the masses have jointly studied and created, overcoming various difficulties in station construction. Wang Shusheng, Secretary of the Xiaotao Commune Party Committee in Yong'an County, personally led the commune members to build a station using indigenous methods in the Shangban Brigade. Lacking blueprints for water turbines, he and technicians jointly designed a wooden propeller-type water turbine blueprint. With insufficient materials, he mobilized the masses to collect local materials, using wood to make water turbines and pulleys. Lacking steel ball bearings, they used ceramic bearings. Lacking steel shafts, they used wooden shafts. Lacking iron nails, they used bamboo nails. In just over ten days, they made a water turbine, a rice milling machine, a rice hulling machine, and a feed crushing machine, each, and built a 7-horsepower water-powered station. The Xiaotao Commune Party Committee organized all management area branch secretaries to hold an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the Shangban Brigade. In just forty days, the entire commune established more than 460 water-powered stations.

Rural people's communes in various localities not only pay attention to utilizing water power energy with large drops, but also create methods for generating electricity using water power with low drops and flat channels. The Xiaopu County Party Committee, according to the characteristics of many streams and flat channels with low drops throughout the county, strengthened its research on this issue. Li Yue, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and carpenters jointly trial-produced a low-drop wooden water turbine. After testing, stations can be set up in field ditches and installed in a mobile manner. A drop of seven inches to one foot can drive the water turbine. As long as the flat water is intercepted by a dam to create a drop, it can also be installed. After the County Party Committee organized 6,000 people to visit, the entire county established more than 120 water-powered stations in twenty days.

Now, the mass movement to vigorously build small water-powered stations and hydropower stations in Fujian Province is continuing to deepen. Many regions, according to the natural conditions of streams and the needs of industrial and agricultural production, have formulated plans for comprehensive utilization of water power and cascade development, and station construction has shifted from individual and sporadic construction to batch and group construction.

    社办工业大显威力　因陋就简就地取材
    浙江福建大办水电站
    新华社杭州13日电　浙江省各地人民公社大办农村水电站、水力站，建设速度越来越快。今年第一季度，全省就建成农村水电站二百零六个，装机容量五千九百八十二瓩，相当于去年全省农村水电站装机总容量的一点零七倍；建成水力站六千八百五十三处，五万二千二百六十五马力，比去年全年建站总数猛增十一点六倍。
    在大办水电站、水力站运动中，广大干部和群众发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，采用因陋就简、就地取材的方法，克服了缺乏器材等的困难。例如，嵊县建设的二十多处水电站和水力站，全部以木代钢，解决了钢轴、轴承、钢管、铁箍不足的困难。这些站建成后，运转情况良好，深受群众欢迎。安吉县报福公社水电站，没有发电机，就利用七瓩的电动机和杨树岭水电站三十瓩发电机并列运行，电动机代替发电机既不要电容器，又不要并车设备，操作简便，效果良好。塘浦公社利用二十厘米的跌差，建成一座管流式流速水电站。这种电站在一般河网地区，只要有一点流速的溪流，放上一个木质管流式水轮机，就可利用来建站发电，为平原地区建站作出了榜样。缙云县总结推广缙云油厂将旧水碓改成水力站，实现生产连续化的经验，在全县开展了以充分利用水力，改革加工工具为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，仅两三个月时间，全县的二百六十多座旧水碓和十五个油厂就使舂米、磨粉、榨油、饲料粉碎等七、八个生产项目全部实现了连续化操作。
    浙江省利用水力的工作很早就开始了。从1958年以来，全省农村已建水电站七百三十三处，水力站七千二百六十四处。这些农村水电站、水力站的建成，对促进农业的技术改造和推动社办工业的发展，都起了巨大的作用。如瑞安县湖岭公社大办水力站，综合利用水碓一百五十八处，相当于一百七十六马力，社办工业机械化、半机械化所占的比重从原来不到18％提高到73.18％，全年共可节省十四万多个劳动日；另外还利用五座水碓发电，使山区用上了电灯。
    新华社福州13日电　福建省农村人民公社充分利用水力资源，大办水力水电建设事业，三个多月来建成投入生产小型水力站九千二百六十多处（等于解放后几年来建站总数的两倍半还多），共有五万一千八百多马力；小型水电站一百八十多处，装机容量共三千五百九十多瓩。加上解放后几年来的建设，全省已有水力站一万二千六百多处，小型水电站六百四十多处，平均每个公社有十七处以上的水力站和一处以上的水电站。
    这些用土法建成的小型水电站和水力站效率都很高。永安县七百六十多处水力站，共带动一千四百五十台碾米、砻谷锯木等机器，平均每处带动近两台，基本实现了农副产品加工动力化。这些水力站在一百天中共加工粮食四千三百多万斤，饲料五千五百万斤，木材五千立方米，节省了一百万个劳动日。洪田公社热西管理区用旧水碓改装成水力站，带动一台三号碾米机，三个多月中已加工出粮食六十万斤，饲料十万多斤。
    福建省境内山岭重叠，有六百多条大小河流，天然落差很大，对发展水力水电事业极为有利。今年各地普遍总结了建立小型水力水电站的经验，进一步加强了领导。不少领导干部和群众共同研究，共同创造，克服了建站中的种种困难。永安县小陶公社党委书记王树生，在上坂大队亲自领导社员用土办法建站，没有水轮机图样，就和技工共同研究设计出一张木质旋桨式水轮机图样；材料不足，就发动群众就地取材，利用木头制成水轮机、皮带轮；没有钢珠轴承用瓷质承，没有钢轴就用木轴，没有铁钉就用竹钉，仅十多天就制成水轮机、碾米机、砻谷机和饲料粉碎机各一部，建成了一处七马力的水力站。小陶公社党委组织所有管理区支部书记开现场会，推广上坂大队的经验，只四十天，全社就建立了四百六十多处水力站。
    各地农村人民公社不仅注意利用落差较大的水力能源，而且还创造出利用落差低、平流渠的水力发电的办法。中共霞浦县委根据全县落差低的溪流和平流渠道很多的特点，加强了对这一问题的研究。县委第一书记李岳和木工共同试制成功一种低落差木质水轮机，经过试验，可以在田间圳沟设站，流动安装，落差七寸至一尺就可以带动水轮机；平流水只要截坝造成落差也可以安装。县委组织了六千人参观后，全县在二十天中就建立了一百二十多处水力站。
    现在，福建省大建小型水力站和水电站的群众运动，正在继续深入展开。不少地区根据溪流的自然条件和工农业生产的需要，订出了综合利用水力和梯级开发的计划，建站工作已由个别的、零星的建设转入成批成群的建设。（附图片）
