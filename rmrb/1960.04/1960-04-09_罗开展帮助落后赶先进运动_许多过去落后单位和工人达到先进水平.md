Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, April 8th: In the campaign to help backward units catch up with advanced ones in Romanian industrial and mining enterprises, many previously backward production teams have now become advanced production teams, and many workers with poor production records have reached the level of advanced workers.

Last summer, Militaru, an advanced worker at the "Nicolae Bălcescu" shoe factory in Bucharest, proposed the initiative of advanced workers helping backward production teams. This initiative, in response from advanced workers in various places, immediately formed a mass movement. This movement received the active support of many enterprise Party organizations, trade union organizations, and administrative leaders. Not long ago, the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions convened a meeting attended by trade union organizations from forty large enterprises in the capital, Bucharest, to discuss how to develop various forms of comradely mutual assistance in enterprises. Because many advanced workers requested to help backward production teams, some enterprises readjusted the members of the production teams according to the workers' technical level, so that each production team was led by advanced workers. Some enterprises, such as the Reșița Metallurgical Combine, organized specialized institutions with the participation of engineers and advanced workers to help workshops with heavy tasks or poor production plan completion.

The above measures have further developed the movement of advanced helping backward, and many workers' technical levels have also improved rapidly. A backward production team at the Craiova Generator Factory increased its labor productivity by 30% after being led by advanced producer Florica. In the second mechanical workshop of the "Tudor Vladimirescu" factory in Bucharest, workers launched a campaign of advanced helping backward last year in order to bring all the workers in the workshop to the level of advanced producers. Now, there is not a single worker in this workshop who is backward in production.

Members of many production teams not only help each other at work but also strengthen collective life, caring for each other and making common progress in political and cultural learning and ideology. A locomotive work team led by Socialist Labor Hero Longu decided to become a model work team in all aspects. Now they are saving several times more coal than before. They often study together, have fun together, and often hold heart-to-heart talks.

In the movement of advanced helping backward, not only many advanced producers actively help backward production teams, but many ordinary workers also request to undertake the most difficult work tasks. Such examples are not only found on the industrial front but also in the countryside. In the "Mihail Kogălniceanu" collective farm, a young female member, Eugenia, requested to do the most arduous work, so she was assigned to raise livestock. Because she actively adopted advanced breeding methods, the number of livestock on the farm increased significantly.

    罗开展帮助落后赶先进运动
    许多过去落后单位和工人达到先进水平
    新华社布加勒斯特8日电　在罗马尼亚工矿企业中开展的帮助落后赶先进的运动中，许多过去落后的生产队现在已经变成先进生产队，许多生产成绩差的工人达到了先进工作者的水平。
    去年夏天，布加勒斯特“尼古拉·巴尔切斯库”制鞋厂的先进工作者米利塔鲁提出了先进工作者帮助落后生产队的倡议。这个倡议在各地先进工作者的响应下，立即形成了一个群众性的运动。这个运动得到了许多企业党组织、工会组织和行政领导的积极支持。不久前，罗马尼亚工会中央理事会曾召集了有首都布加勒斯特四十个大企业的工会组织参加的会议，讨论了如何发展企业中各种同志式互助的形式。由于许多先进工作者都要求去帮助落后生产队，有的企业按照工人的技术水平重新调整了生产队的成员，使每个生产队都由先进工作者来领导。有的企业，如累希擦冶炼联合企业，组织了有工程师和先进工作者参加的专门机构去帮助那些任务繁重或生产计划完成得不好的车间。
    以上一些措施使先进带落后的运动进一步发展了，许多工人的技术水平也提高得很快。克拉约发电机制造厂的一个落后生产队，在由先进生产者弗洛利卡领导后，劳动生产率提高了30％。在布加勒斯特的“图多·弗拉吉米列斯库”工厂第二机械车间中，工人们为使全车间的工人都达到先进生产者的水平，在去年开展了先进帮落后的运动。现在，在这个车间里已经没有一个在生产上落后的了。
    许多生产队的成员不但在工作上相互帮助，而且加强了集体生活，在政治文化学习和思想上也相互关怀，共同进步。社会主义劳动英雄龙古领导的一个火车机车工作队，决定成为一个在各方面都称得上是模范的工作队。现在他们节约的煤比以前增加了好几倍。他们经常在一起学习、一起娱乐，并常常举行谈心会。
    在先进帮落后的运动中，不但许多先进生产者积极帮助落后生产队，许多普通工人也要求担负最困难的工作任务。这种例子不仅在工业战线上有，在农村中也有。在“米哈伊尔·科加耳尼恰诺”集体农庄，年青的女庄员尤金尼亚请求做最繁重的工作，于是她被派去饲养牲畜。由于她积极采用先进的饲养方法，农庄的牲畜头数有了显著的增长。
