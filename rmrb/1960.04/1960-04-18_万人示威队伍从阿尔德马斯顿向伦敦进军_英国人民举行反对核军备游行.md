Xinhua News Agency, London, April 15th (Reporter Peng Di): More than ten thousand British people gathered today in front of the Aldermaston British nuclear weapons research center, and began a large-scale demonstration march from Aldermaston to London, demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a disarmament agreement at the highest-level conference.

　　The British nuclear weapons research center, Aldermaston, has become a symbol of the nuclear war policies prepared by the US and British governments, and therefore, it has naturally become the target of the struggle of millions of peace-loving British people to end this insane policy. Since 1958, every year thousands upon thousands of people have come to this place to hold large-scale gatherings and demonstrations, expressing their hatred for nuclear war policies.

　　The number of people participating in this year's march is double the number of people who departed from Aldermaston last year. Demonstrators will hold a large-scale mass rally in Trafalgar Square, London on Monday.

　　At noon today, hundreds of cars, trucks, and motorcycles carrying demonstrators came from all over the country to the gathering place in front of this atomic weapons research institution. Among them were representatives of various trade union organizations and nuclear disarmament organizations established in many regions, holding high their flags. Various political parties and groups organized their own teams. In the ranks of the Communist Party of Great Britain, there were Party General Secretary Gollan and other members of the Executive Committee. The Communist Youth League and other youth organizations were the most active among the marchers. There were also some Labour Party members of Parliament in the marching ranks.

　　All the gates and entrances of this research institution were locked with chains today, and many policemen and security personnel patrolled outside with police dogs. Behind the barbed wire, a red sign was hung with the word "Danger" written on it. There was a deathly silence in the research institution.

　　The marching队伍队伍 passed in front of the research institution under the strict surveillance of the police. They shouted slogans, sang songs, and waved placards to express their anger. In the marching column, there were also teams composed of many international people. Among them were Ghanaians, Nigerians, Guineans, Cypriots, Indians, and Pakistanis. They held up placards with slogans such as "Stop nuclear testing in the Sahara," "We march for peace," and "We like humanity, not the arms race." Many Americans, Germans, French, Italians, and Dutch also participated in the march. Large banners along the way read: "Not a single bomb to the Hitler generals," "Don't let blood stain our hands," "Stop the nuclear arms race," and "Create a new atmosphere for peace negotiations."

　　Young workers and students accounted for the majority of the five-mile-long procession. Many of the banners they held read, "Youth march for life and the future," "Withdraw from NATO and SEATO." Several people carried a black coffin under a large banner that read, "Bury bombs, not humanity."

　　The marchers strongly opposed the agreement reached between the US and British governments to establish a special radar system in Fylingdales. It is said that this system can give a warning four minutes before Britain is attacked in the event of a nuclear war. Many marchers held up signs that read "Four Minutes to Die."

    万人示威队伍从阿尔德马斯顿向伦敦进军
    英国人民举行反对核军备游行
    新华社伦敦15日电　本社记者彭迪报道：一万多英国人今天在阿尔德马斯顿英国核武器研究中心门前集会，开始了从阿尔德马斯顿到伦敦的大规模示威游行，要求禁止核武器和在最高级会议上缔结裁军协议。
    英国的核武器研究中心阿尔德马斯顿已经成为美英两国政府准备核战争政策的象征，因此它也就很
  自然地成为千百万爱好和平的英国人民争取结束这种疯狂政策的斗争的目标。自从1958年以来，每年都有成千上万的人民来到这个地方举行大规模集会和游行示威，表示他们对核战争政策的憎恨。
    参加今年游行的人数比去年从阿尔德马斯顿出发的人数多一倍。示威者星期一将在伦敦特拉法加广场举行大规模的群众大会。
    今天中午，数以百计载运着示威者的轿车、卡车和摩托车从全国各地来到这个原子武器研究机构前面的集会地点。他们当中有各业工会组织和在许多地区成立的核裁军机构的代表，他们高举着旗帜。各政党和团体自己组织了队伍。在英国共产党的队伍中，有党的总书记高兰和执行委员会的其它委员。共产主义青年团和其它青年组织在游行者当中最为活跃。游行队伍中还有一些工党议员。
    这个研究机构今天所有的大门和进口处都上了锁链，许多警察和保安人员带着警犬在外边巡逻，在铁丝网后面，挂着一个红色的牌子，上面写着“危险”的字样。研究机构里死一般的寂静。
    游行队伍在警察的森严监视下通过研究机构门前，他们高呼口号、唱歌和挥舞标语牌表示他们的愤怒。在游行行列中还有许多国际人士组成的队伍。他们中间有加纳人、尼日利亚人、几内亚人、塞浦路斯人、印度人和巴基斯坦人。他们高举着标语牌，上面写着“停止在撒哈拉的核试验”、“我们为和平而游行”、“我们喜欢人类，而不喜欢军备竞赛”。许多美国人、德国人、法国人、意大利人、荷兰人也参加了游行。沿途大标语上写着：“不给希特勒将军们一枚炸弹”、“不让血染红我们的手”、“停止核武器军备竞赛”、“为和平谈判创造新的气氛”。
    青年工人和学生在五英里长的游行队伍中占大部分。他们高举着的许多横幅标语写道，“青年为生活和前途而游行”、“退出北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织”、有几个人在“埋葬炸弹，而不是埋葬人类”的横幅大标语下面，抬着一口黑色棺材。
    游行者强烈地反对美英两国政府就在法林达勒斯建立的特别雷达系统达成的协议。据说，这个系统能够在爆发核战争时英国遭到袭击的四分钟以前，给予警告。许多游行者高举着“四分钟就要死亡”的标语牌。
