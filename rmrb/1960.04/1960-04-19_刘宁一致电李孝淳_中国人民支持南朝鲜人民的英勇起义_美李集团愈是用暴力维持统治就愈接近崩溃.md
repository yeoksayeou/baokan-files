    Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Li Xiaochun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Occupational General Alliance, stating that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people deeply sympathize with the plight of the South Korean people and firmly support the heroic uprising of the people of Masan and other places in South Korea against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee group.
    Liu Ningyi's telegram said: "The suffering of the South Korean people is caused by the US imperialists' insistence on dividing Korea and completely turning South Korea into its colony and war base. The brutal rule of the Syngman Rhee group, maintained by US imperialist bayonets, has made South Korea a living hell.
    "The uprising of the Masan people is an eruption of the long-accumulated anger of the South Korean people against the US-Li tyranny. It shows that, contrary to the wishes of the United States imperialists and the Syngman Rhee group, the more they intensify the use of violence to maintain their rule, the closer they get to collapse.
    "The struggle of the people of Masan and other places is not isolated. It is directly encouraged and fully supported by the entire people of the northern half of the Republic, and sympathized with by all righteous people in the world. We firmly believe that as long as the South Korean people strengthen their unity and fight, they will surely be able to get rid of fascist rule and force the US military to get out of South Korea at an early date. The Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory!"

    刘宁一致电李孝淳
    中国人民支持南朝鲜人民的英勇起义
    美李集团愈是用暴力维持统治就愈接近崩溃
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天打电报给朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳说，中国工人阶级和中国人民深切同情南朝鲜人民的痛苦处境，坚决支持南朝鲜马山等地人民反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的英勇起义。
    刘宁一的电报说：“南朝鲜人民的苦难，是美帝国主义坚持分裂朝鲜和把南朝鲜彻底变成它的殖民地和战争基地的侵略政策造成的。依靠美帝国主义的刺刀维持的李承晚集团的残暴统治，已使南朝鲜成为人间地狱。
    “马山人民的起义是南朝鲜人民对美李暴政久已蕴积的怒火的爆发。它表明，事实和美帝国主义及李承晚集团的愿望相反，他们愈加紧用暴力维持其统治，就愈接近崩溃。
    “马山等地人民的斗争不是孤立的。它得到共和国北半部全体人民的直接鼓舞和全力支持，和全世界正义人类的同情。我们坚信，只要南朝鲜人民加强团结，进行斗争，就定能早日摆脱法西斯统治，迫使美军滚出南朝鲜。朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争必将获得最后胜利！”
