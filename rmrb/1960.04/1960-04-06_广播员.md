    Announcer
    Zhang Zhiwei
    Since the start of the technical performance competition, it’s been keeping the announcer, Little Sun, extremely busy. Piles and piles of broadcast scripts are stacked on her desk, resembling small mountains. But she handles all these scripts every day with extra shifts. Lately, several blockheaded young men often barge into the broadcasting room, gesticulating wildly and saying, "Hey, Comrade Little Sun, take a look at these reports of victory..." Little Sun gets furious hearing this, feeling quite helpless with these mischievous young men. She thinks: You guys, no need to beat around the bush, I know what you're going to say next: "Creating miracles on a whole trainload, and you're still at home under the covers." But I’m not late, I’m even an hour early! She pouts feeling wronged, and thinks: These blockheaded young men just don't know how to be considerate.
    Really, the announcer has been truly exhausted lately, guarding the broadcasting device every day, broadcasting at nine, ten, eleven o'clock, endlessly. When she really can't bear it anymore, she lies down on the bed for a while. At the sound of gongs and drums, she jumps up, turns on the broadcasting device, and broadcasts until twelve o'clock in one breath. Even when the second shift workers go off duty, she still reluctantly guards the broadcasting device, until Secretary Zhao urges her several times before she slowly leaves the broadcasting room. But every morning, she suffers these young men's taunts. She really feels a bit wronged.
    Every day, the work begins with rebroadcasting the news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and then she starts busily flipping through these victory reports with ink that hasn't even dried yet. This room is very spacious. The broadcasting device only occupies a corner of the eastern part of the room, and the rest of the large space is filled with these colorful, different-sized victory reports.
    Little Sun was inspecting these victory reports when suddenly the words "Seconds Matter" jumped into view. The content below read:
    "Comrade Wang Zhenfa of the mechanical workshop, displayed the noble communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act. The drilling jig for the shaft was successfully tested at 3:10 PM yesterday and officially put into production at 3:13 PM, jumping from drilling one shaft in ten minutes and thirty seconds in the past, to two minutes and twenty-five seconds per shaft."
    Ah! It really succeeded. She lowered her head shyly, regretting that she shouldn't have said to Wang Zhenfa yesterday: "Don't brag, two minutes per shaft, hmph! Aren't you afraid of stretching the cowhide too thin!" Although it was a joke, but...
    She quickly picked up the victory report, ran to the broadcasting device, adjusted the volume, and began broadcasting with a high and resonant tone: "Comrade Wang Zhenfa of the mechanical workshop, displayed the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act. The drilling jig for the shaft was successfully tested at 3:10 PM yesterday and officially put into production at 3:13 PM, jumping from drilling one shaft in ten minutes and thirty seconds in the past, to..."
    Dong dong keng, dong keng, dong, a burst of gongs, drums, and firecrackers drowned out her voice. "Little Sun, Little Sun..." a blockheaded young man ran in, "Don't, don't, don't broadcast..." Because of excitement and impatience, he became a bit stammering. "Click," Little Sun smartly closed the broadcasting device. "What's wrong?" Little Sun asked suspiciously. "This victory report is, is, is, outdated again..." "Outdated again!" Little Sun asked, pursuing the question, "Look at this!" The victory report read: "From the past ten minutes and thirty seconds jumped to two minutes and twenty-five seconds, now it has jumped to one minute and fifty-six seconds." At this time, Wang Zhenfa arrived. Little Sun glanced at him, feeling a hot flush on her face, embarrassed. "Come, come, Comrade Zhenfa, come to the broadcasting device and introduce your advanced experience." Party Branch Secretary Zhao invited Little Wang to the broadcasting device. Little Sun also busied herself adjusting the volume, giving him space. She looked at Wang Zhenfa who hadn't spoken yet, looking at his pair of bright, rolling black eyes, and although her face felt a little hot, her heart felt sweet...

    广播员
    张之维
    自从开展技术表演赛以来，可把广播员小孙忙坏了，一堆堆的广播稿件，堆在桌子上。像一座座小山。可她每天都连班加点的把这些稿件处理完。这几天，时常有几个楞头楞脑的小伙子，一闯进广播室的门，就指手划脚地说：“喂，小孙同志，你看看这些报捷书……”小孙听见这话气极了，对这些顽皮的小伙子真有点束手无策。她想：你们呀，甭拐弯抹角了，早知道后边的话是：“创造奇迹满火车，你还在家恋被窝”。可是我没来晚呀，还提前一个小时呢！她委屈地鼓了鼓嘴，又想：这些楞头小伙子，就不知体贴人。
    真的，近月来，把广播员可真累的够呛，每天守着那台播音器，九点，十点，十一点，广播起来就没个完。她实在熬不住了，就躺在床上睡一会。一听见锣鼓声，一骨碌就爬起来，扭开播音器就广播，一口气到十二点。二班的也下班了，她还恋恋不舍地守着播音器，直到赵书记来催她几遍，才慢吞吞的离开广播室。可每天一清早老受这些小伙子们的抢白。她真感到有点委屈。
    每天工作一开始是转播中央人民广播电台的新闻，然后就开始忙着翻看这些字迹尚未全干的报捷书。这间屋子很宽敞。广播器只占这间屋子东部的一个墙角，其余的大块地方，都叫那些五颜六色，大小不一的报捷书给占满了。
    小孙正巡视着这些报捷书，突然“分秒”这两个大字一下跃到眼前，下面的内容是：
    “机械车间王振发同志，发挥了敢想敢干的高尚共产主义风格，肖轴钻眼胎具，从昨天下午三时十分试验成功，三时十三分正式投入生产，由过去十分三十秒钻一根肖轴，跃到二分二十五秒一根。”
    啊呀！真的成功了。她羞涩地低下了头，后悔昨天不该说王振发：“你甭吹了，二分钟一根，哼！不怕把牛皮吹豁了边！”虽然是开玩笑，但是……
    她赶快拿起了报捷书，跑到播音器前，对好了音量，用高昂宏亮的音调开始播送：“机械车间，王振发同志，发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，肖轴钻眼胎具从昨天下午三时十分试验成功，三时十三分正式投入生产，由过去十分三十秒钻一根肖轴，跃到……”
    咚咚铿，咚铿，咚，一阵锣鼓声，鞭炮声淹没了她的声音。“小孙，小孙……”一个楞头楞脑的小伙子跑进来，“别，别，别广播了……”由于激动和急躁，他变得有点口吃了。“咔”小孙机灵地闭上了广播器。“怎么的了？”小孙惊疑地问。“这张报捷书，又，又，又落后了……”“又落后了！”小孙追问了一句，“看看这！”只见报捷书上写着：“由过去十分三十秒跃到二分二十五秒，现在又跃到一分五十六秒了。”这时，王振发来了。小孙瞅了他一眼，感到脸上热辣辣的，不好意思。“来来，振发同志，到播音器前介绍介绍先进经验吧。”党支部赵书记把小王请到播音器前。小孙也忙着调整音量，给他让地方。她望着还未讲话的王振发，望着他那一对发光的滴溜溜转动的黑眼睛，脸上虽然有些热辣辣的，可心里却感到甜蜜蜜的……。
