    Make Science Education Films Better Serve Socialist Construction
    Hong Lin
    Since the birth of science education films in our country in 1952, under the correct leadership of the Party, they have grown rapidly and vigorously. Taking the Shanghai Science Education Film Studio as an example, in the past few years, it has produced more than 310 science education films, 77 issues of the "Science and Technology" magazine film, and translated nearly 300 science education films from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The quality of the films has also improved year by year, and excellent films such as "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," "Freshwater Fish Farming," "How the Yangtze River Bridge Was Built," "Artificial Satellites in the Sky," "Ode to the Red Flag," "The Triumph of Life," "Large-Area Wheat Harvest," and "Chinese Ape-Man" have been produced.
    Especially after the Party's general line for building socialism was put forward, along with the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, science education films, like other types of films, have achieved remarkable results. The films have become more steadfast in implementing the policy of serving politics and serving production, and are more closely integrated with the current political situation and production practice. The proportion of themes related to industrial and agricultural production has increased from 60% in the past to 85%, so that the advanced production experiences created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward can be largely reflected in the films and spread to various places. For some major themes, batch shooting methods have also been implemented, such as those on steelmaking and ironmaking technology, factory technological innovation, high-yield rice experience, agricultural tool reform, and farmland water conservancy, all of which have been continuously produced into several or one or twenty films. The political and ideological nature of many films has been improved, and a new level has been reached in scientific content and expression techniques.
    At present, science education films are not only familiar and loved by the broad masses of viewers, but also have been well used in many areas, playing their due role. For example, Anyang City, Henan Province, in coordination with the education of workers in reading mechanical drawings, has organized workers to watch the "Accelerated Blueprint Reading Method" film four times in a row, helping workers to master blueprint reading skills as soon as possible. Workers in a foundry in Shanghai, after watching the "Lost Mold Casting" film, returned to the factory and did it according to the method introduced in the film, thereby increasing production efficiency by one time. Workers at the Mishan Reservoir in Heilongjiang have learned several tools from the tool reform film and wrote to the film studio requesting a drawing of another new tool. Some counties and communes use agricultural high-yield experience films to promote agricultural production technology, and they are particularly interested in films on the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. The masses regard watching science education films as an important method for learning scientific and technological knowledge. Some viewers even take notes in the dark in the cinema while watching the film, or organize discussions during the breaks in the screening. All the achievements of China's science education films have been achieved under the glorious light of the Party's general line and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thinking on literature and art.
    Actively serving production, serving the cultural revolution and technological revolution, serving socialist construction, and closely integrating with China's political situation and production practice are the basic guidelines that the science education film industry should follow. To serve well and integrate well, science education films mainly carry out their tasks from the following aspects.
    First, disseminate advanced production experience and vigorously promote production technology. In the vigorously developing mass technical revolution and technical innovation movement, new creations and inventions are emerging one after another, and production technology is also changing with each passing day. Many of these need to be rapidly promoted, and here, science education films have become a powerful propaganda tool. These films are more specialized, some even specifically produced for workers in a certain type of work in a certain department (such as the recently filmed "Side-Blown Alkaline Converter Operation Method," which is specifically for the smelting workers of this type of converter). Its role is also different from general films. Although its audience is limited to a certain extent, it can more directly serve production and promote the improvement of labor productivity. Therefore, for the distribution of such films, there must be a corresponding "targeted screening" method.
    Among these technology promotion films, it is currently necessary to use more effort to reflect agricultural technology transformation, technical issues in realizing agricultural modernization, and better serve the 500 million peasants. For example, the seven types of rice transplanters that have now been finalized and promoted nationwide need to be quickly filmed to cooperate with the work of training mechanical rice transplanting operators in various places. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is the crystallization of our country's agricultural production experience, and it also needs to be further systematically introduced to make it a complete set of science education films.
    Second, popularize scientific knowledge and improve the people's scientific and cultural level. In the current mass movement to march towards science, learning cultural and scientific knowledge has become a hot trend. Comrade Lu Dingyi said at the National Congress of Heroes last year: "Once the workers and peasants master culture, science, and technology, it is like a steed with wings in production. They will be able to give fuller play to their rich production experience and creativity and promote the leap forward in socialist construction." Science education films should shoulder the task of adding wings to steeds, shooting various films that popularize scientific knowledge, such as chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy, etc. These films must be linked to reality, be easy to understand, and be loved by the general audience, truly achieving what Lenin instructed for science education films, becoming "illustrated popular lectures." In these films, the introduction of new modern scientific knowledge should not be ignored, and some emerging sciences should be explained in a simple and easy-to-understand way. In addition to films aimed at adults, we can also specifically shoot science and technology films for children, encourage our next generation's tenacious will to study science, and expand their knowledge field.
    Third, films for teaching. We have made very few of these films in the past, but this is a very important task, and it needs to be greatly strengthened in the future. This kind of film is shot according to teaching needs, according to the teaching syllabus, and according to different grades and different objects. Especially for the difficulties in teaching, teaching films can give full play to the characteristics of film images and help students understand quickly. This kind of film can be used in primary and secondary schools, as well as in spare-time schools and TV universities. It is a powerful tutoring tool in teaching.
    Fourth, documentary science and technology films. This type of film focuses on introducing the creative spirit of our working people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and introduces new achievements in science and technology. Although this kind of film does not talk about technical issues as carefully as technology promotion films, it is very enlightening, allowing people to infer the rest from one corner and apply it to their own work departments. Its difference from general news documentaries is that it focuses on the scientific explanation of the struggle of mankind to transform nature and some of the tips in technological innovation. For example, the film "Small Factories Realize Mechanization," which was released not long ago, specifically introduced how a neighborhood seamless steel pipe factory in Shanghai broke through several key technical problems and realized the process of mechanization. After watching this film, some factory workers felt that their equipment was very poor, but they could still innovate so boldly. Therefore, if their conditions are good, they will definitely be able to realize mechanization ahead of schedule. Therefore, they learned the spirit of tackling key problems introduced in the film and achieved good results.
    According to the above-mentioned tasks and objects, we can roughly divide science education films into four categories: technology promotion films, popular science films, teaching films, and science documentary films. Naturally, this classification cannot be understood mechanically, and many films combine more than two tasks. In addition to these four types, there are also scientific research films, science and technology magazine films, science fiction films, and so on. However, no matter what type of science education film, it must have a high degree of political and ideological character, rich scientific content, and vivid and clear images. This is our main experience in improving the quality of films.
    In our factory, there once appeared an argument that science education films are about scientific and technological issues, and there is no need to talk about ideology. They attempted to use the so-called special function of science education films to cancel the political and ideological education role of films. In fact, Chairman Mao's saying, "put the political standard first, and the artistic standard second," is suitable for all literary and artistic works, and as a type of film - science education films are no exception.
    Spreading knowledge is not our ultimate goal in itself. Ultimately, the effect of a film depends on how it promotes production, how it serves socialist construction, and how it conducts socialist and communist education. As early as when our country just started shooting science education films, the Party and the state pointed out that this kind of film must use the materialist worldview to explain various natural and social phenomena, and must fight against various idealist viewpoints. Just like when we shoot a film like "Chinese Ape-Man," we should use the historical materialism view of labor creating mankind as the red line. All about the physical characteristics of the ape-man, tool manufacturing, and the use of fire, must be closely around this point of view. Without this view, then the film can at most become fragmented and disorganized pieces of knowledge. Chairman Mao told us: "Without a correct political point of view, it is equivalent to having no soul." To extract the ideology of the film is to extract the soul of the film. Therefore, to improve the quality of science education films, we must constantly strive to improve the political and ideological nature of the film.
    Of course, science education films have their own characteristics. They are different from other types of films. They are to impart scientific and technological knowledge. Therefore, a good science education film must have rich scientific and technological content. The audience goes to the cinema to watch science education films, always hoping to gain more knowledge. They require this knowledge to be correct, profound, novel, and at the same time understandable and acceptable to them. In the science education films produced in the past few years, the content of knowledge has been gradually enriched, but there are still some films that are relatively superficial, thin, and even individual places that are not completely correct. In more cases, at the important key points, they lightly gloss over them. It is precisely in this place that the audience needs to know why and needs to explore its essence, but some films just become vague when they talk about it, or shift to other issues. At the same time, some films, in order to strengthen the scientific nature, unnecessarily add some complicated formulas, numbers, and animations, making people feel profound and difficult to understand. This approach is also divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Correcting this phenomenon of vagueness and superficiality and profundity and difficulty to understand, and striving to be rich and fulfilling in content and appropriate and easy to understand, is indeed an important issue in the current creation of science education films.
    In order to improve the quality of science education films, we must also have beautiful and vivid forms of expression. Some people think that films about science and technology are inevitably boring, tedious, and rigid. This is indeed a misunderstanding. Gorky had already talked about this issue in his article on scientific and literary readings. Many excellent science education films have also proved in fact that they are lively, interesting, and fascinating. Of course, the form of expression of science education films should also have its own characteristics. It cannot meticulously portray characters, cannot fabricate plots away from scientific content, it especially needs to have clear levels and a strict structure, to explain the problem clearly, so that the audience can generate interest on the basis of understanding, and gradually delve into the inherent laws of science.
    The combination of a high degree of ideology and rich scientific content, while at the same time having as vivid and beautiful an image as possible, is what we require of science education films.
    New China has entered the second more glorious decade. In the new decade, it is necessary to basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and build our country into a strong socialist country. At present, a nationwide technical revolution and technical innovation movement is being carried out vigorously, and the broad masses are calling out to conquer the cultural mountain and break into the palace of science. Under such circumstances, the mission undertaken by science education films is even more important. The Party and the state have decided to vigorously develop this cause. Many regions and many departments will successively shoot a large number of science education films. The work of using films for science and technology education in factories, rural areas, and schools will also have new progress. All of this is indeed an extremely exciting thing for us who are engaged in this work. We are determined to, under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, work with all brother units to better complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the state, and strive for a greater harvest of science education films.

    使科学教育电影更好地为社会主义建设服务
    洪林
    我国科学教育电影自1952年诞生以来，在党的正确领导下，已经迅速地成长茁壮起来。拿上海科学教育电影制片厂来说，几年来共摄制了三百一十余部科教片，七十七号“科学与技术”杂志片，还翻译了苏联及各人民民主国家的科教片近三百部。影片的质量也逐年提高，拍摄了像“培育壮秧”、“淡水养鱼”、“长江大桥是怎样建成的”、“人造卫星上了天”、“红旗颂”、“生命的凯歌”、“小麦大面积丰收”、“中国猿人”等优秀影片。
    特别是在党的建设社会主义总路线提出以后，随着全国大跃进的形势，科学教育电影也与其他片种一样，取得了显著的成绩。影片在贯彻为政治服务、为生产服务的方针上更加坚定，与当前政治形势、生产实践结合得更为密切。有关工农业生产的题材比例由过去的60％上升到85％，这样使得在大跃进中群众创造的先进生产经验，能以在影片中大量地反映出来，传至各地。对于一些重大的题材，又实行了成批拍摄的办法，如关于炼钢炼铁的技术，工厂的技术革新，水稻丰产经验，农具改革，农田水利等，均曾连续摄制成几部或一、二十部影片，许多影片的政治性思想性提高了，而在科学内容和表现手法上也达到了一个新的水平。
    目前科学教育影片不仅为广大观众所熟悉、所喜爱，而且在不少地区还得到了很好的运用，发挥了它应有的作用。如河南省安阳市配合向工人进行看机械图纸的教育，曾连续组织工人观看“速成看图法”影片四次，帮助了工人早日掌握看图技术。上海一家翻砂厂的工人在看了“漏模造型”影片后，回到厂里就按片中所介绍的方法做了，从而提高生产效率一倍。黑龙江密山水库工人已经从工具改革的影片中学会了几种工具，并来信给制片厂要求寄给另一种新工具的图样。一些县和公社则运用农业丰产经验的影片来推广农业生产技术，他们对于农业八字宪法的影片，尤其感到兴趣。群众把看科教片视为学习科学技术知识的重要方法，有的观众甚至一面看电影，一面在影院内摸黑记笔记，或是利用放映中的间歇时间组织讨论。我国科学教育电影的一切成就，都是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛主席文艺思想指导下所取得的。
    积极地为生产服务，为文化革命技术革命服务，为社会主义建设服务，紧密地与我国政治形势和生产实践相结合，这是科学教育电影事业所应遵循的基本方针。而要服务得好，结合得好，科学教育片主要是从以下几个方面来执行它的任务的。
    一是传播先进生产经验，大力推广生产技术。在蓬勃发展的群众性的技术革命和技术革新运动中，新的创造发明层出叠现，生产技术也是日新月异，其中有许多项是迫切地需要迅速推广，在这里，科教片便成了一种有力的宣传工具。这类影片的专业性较强，有的甚至是专为某个部门中的某个工种的工人而摄制的（如最近拍摄的“侧吹碱性转炉操作法”即是专为这种转炉的冶炼工人的），其作用亦不同于一般影片，虽然它的观众面有着一定的限制，但是却可以更直接地为生产服务，促进劳动生产率的提高。因此对于这类影片的发行工作，就要有一套相适应的“对口放映”的办法。
    在这类技术推广片中，目前需要用较多力量来反映农业技术改造，实现农业现代化中的技术问题，更好地为五亿农民服务。譬如现在正在全国推广的七种已定型的插秧机，便需要迅速地拍成影片，来配合各地训练机械插秧操作手的工作。农业“八字宪法”是我国农业生产经验的结晶，也还需要作进一步有系统的介绍，使之成为一套完整的科学教育片。
    二是普及科学知识，提高人民科学文化水平。在目前向科学进军的群众性的运动中，学习文化科学知识已成热潮，陆定一同志在去年全国群英会上曾说了这样一段话：“工农群众一旦掌握了文化科学和技术，在生产中好比骏马添了双翼，就能够更充分地发挥他们丰富的生产经验和创造性，推动社会主义建设事业飞跃前进。”科学教育电影就应当肩负起这种为骏马添双翼的工作，拍摄各种普及科学知识的影片，如化学、物理学、生物学、天文学等。这些影片必须联系实际，通俗易懂，为一般观众所喜爱，真正做到列宁对科学教育影片所指示的那样，成为“形象化的通俗演讲”。在这类影片中也不能忽视对新的现代化科学知识的介绍，对一些新兴科学作些深入浅出的解释。除了以成人为对象的影片以外，还可专门拍摄一些为少年儿童们看的科学技术影片，鼓励我们的下一代钻研科学的顽强意志，扩展他们的知识领域。
    三是为教学拍摄的影片。这类影片我们过去拍的很少，但这是一件十分重要的工作，今后也需要大大加强。这种影片是根据教学需要，依照教学大纲，并按不同年级不同对象而进行拍摄的。尤其对于教学中的难点，教学影片可以充分发挥电影形象的特点，帮助学生迅速理解。这类影片既可用之于大中小学，也可用之于业余学校、电视大学，它是教学中有力的辅导工具。
    四是纪录性的科学技术影片。这类影片着重介绍我国劳动人民敢想敢说敢做的创造精神，介绍科学技术上的新成就。虽然这种影片对于技术问题讲得不像技术推广片那样细致，但它的启发性很大，使人们可以举一隅而反三，用之于自己的工作部门。它和一般新闻纪录片不同的地方，是它对于人类改造自然的斗争，对于一些技术革新中的窍门，要着重于科学的解释。如前不久上映的影片“小厂实现机械化”，便是具体地介绍了上海的一家里弄无缝钢管厂怎样攻破了几个技术关键问题，而实现了机械化的过程。有的工厂工人看了此片后，觉得人家设备很差，尚能如此大胆革新，那么自己条件好，也一定能提前实现机械化，因而学习影片中介绍的攻关键的精神，获得了很好的成绩。
    按照以上所说的任务、对象，我们对于科学教育片大体上可以划分为技术推广片、科学普及片、教学片、科学纪录片等四类。自然，这种分类是不可以机械地理解的，很多影片便是兼有两种以上的任务的。除了这四种以外，也还有科学研究片、科技杂志片、科学幻想片等等。但是，不管哪一类的科学教育影片，都必须具有高度的政治性思想性，丰富的科学内容，和生动鲜明的形象。这一点是我们在提高影片质量方面的主要体会。
    在我们厂里曾经出现过一种论调，认为科教片就是讲科学技术问题的，不必谈什么思想性，他们企图以所谓科教片的特殊功能来取消影片的政治思想教育作用。实际上，毛主席所说的“以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位”，是适合于一切文艺作品的，作为电影的一个片种——科学教育片绝不能例外。
    传播知识本身并不是我们的最后目的，一部影片的效果，归根到底，是要看它在促进生产方面的作用如何，为社会主义建设服务得如何，对社会主义和共产主义教育进行得如何。早在我国刚刚开始拍摄科学教育片的时候，党和国家就指出，这种影片必须以唯物主义的世界观来解释各种自然现象和社会现象，必须和各种各样的唯心主义观点作斗争。就像我们拍摄“中国猿人”这样一部影片，便应以劳动创造人类的历史唯物主义观点作为红线，所有关于猿人的体质特征、工具制造、火的使用，都要紧紧地围绕着这一观点。如果没有这种观点，那么影片至多只能成为支离破碎、杂乱无章的知识片断。毛主席告诉我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。抽去了影片的思想性，就是抽去了影片的灵魂。因此，要提高科教片的质量，必须要不断地为提高影片的政治性思想性而努力。
    当然，科教片有它的特性，它和其他片种是不同的，它是要传授科学技术知识的，因此一部好的科教片，必须有丰富的科学技术内容。观众到影院里来看科教片，总希望多获得一些知识。他们要求这种知识是正确的、深刻的、新颖的，同时又是为自己能够懂得能够接受的。这几年出品的科教片中，知识内容是在逐渐充实着，但是也仍然有些影片是比较肤浅的，单薄的，甚至个别地方还有不完全正确的。比较多的情况，是在重要的关键所在，轻轻滑过。观众们正是在这个地方需要知其所以然，需要探求其本质，而有的影片恰是讲到这里就含糊起来，或是转移到别的问题上去了。同时也有的影片为了加强科学性，不必要地增加一些复杂的公式数字和动画，使人感到深奥难懂，这样的做法，也同样是脱离群众脱离实际的。纠正这种模糊肤浅与深奥难懂的现象，力求在内容上丰富充实而又恰切易懂，这确是目前科教片创作中一个重要问题。
    为了提高科教片的质量，还要有优美生动的表现形式。有人认为，讲述科学技术的影片总免不了会枯燥乏味，生硬呆板的，这实是一种误解。高尔基在论述科学文艺读物的文章中，早就谈到了这一问题。许多优秀的科教片也在事实上证明了它们是生动活泼、引人入胜的。当然，科教片的表现形式，也应有自己的特色，它无法细致地刻划人物，不可以离开科学内容去虚构情节，它特别需要层次分明结构严密，把问题说得清清楚楚，使观众在理解的基础上产生兴趣，而逐步深入到科学的内在规律中去。
    高度的思想性与丰富的科学内容相结合，同时又尽可能具有生动优美的形象，这便是我们对于科学教育影片的要求。
    新中国已经跨进了第二个更光辉的十年，在新的十年内，要基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家。目前一个全国性的技术革命和技术革新运动，正在轰轰烈烈地开展着，广大群众高呼着要攻下文化山，闯进科学宫。在这样的形势下，科学教育电影所担负的使命更加重大了。党和国家决定大力发展这一事业，许多地区和许多部门都将陆续拍摄大量的科教片。而在工厂中、农村中、学校中运用电影进行科学技术教育的工作也将有新的进展。这一切对于我们从事这一工作的人来说，确是无比兴奋的事。我们决心在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想指引下，和各兄弟单位一道，更好地完成党和国家所交付给我们的光荣任务，力争科学教育电影的更大丰收。
