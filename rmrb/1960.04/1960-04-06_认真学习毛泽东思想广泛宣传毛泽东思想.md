    A high tide of studying and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought is now sweeping the country, carrying great practical and far-reaching historical significance. Communist Party members and the vast number of cadres from all ethnic minorities, as well as all comrades working among ethnic minorities, should actively plunge into this study movement, further conscientiously and systematically delve into Chairman Mao's works, deeply study and widely publicize Mao Zedong Thought, in order to further enhance their socialist and communist awareness, improve their Marxist-Leninist theoretical level, and further improve their work. This study movement should also be widely carried out among the broad masses of people of all ethnic minorities. Listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and we will be invincible. The cause of revolution and construction in our ethnic minority areas will be smoother and develop faster and continuously than it is now.

    Comrade Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of the Chinese revolution and the great leader whom the people of all nationalities in our country infinitely love. In the earth-shaking revolutionary struggles of the past few decades in China, Comrade Mao Zedong, with his incomparably firm proletarian stance, lofty and selfless communist style, outstanding Marxist-Leninist theoretical accomplishment, and visionary scientific foresight, led the people of all nationalities in our country from victory to greater victory. Comrade Mao Zedong closely integrated the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, making the great truth of Marxism-Leninism victorious in a country of 650 million people, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. It is our Chairman Mao who first put forward the Party's general line and a complete set of principles and policies for each period in our country's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, thereby guiding us to continuously achieve victories in the continuous revolution; it is our Chairman Mao who has consistently adhered to the correct line for decades, leading the whole Party in an irreconcilable and resolute struggle against all kinds of opportunism and revisionism, thereby safeguarding the Party's line, the Party's principles, and the Party's cause; it is our Chairman Mao who has taught us, whenever the revolution encountered difficulties, faced risks, or even reached a critical juncture where the situation was very dangerous, to see through the phenomena, grasp the essence, strengthen our confidence, overcome difficulties, and lead us to advance victoriously through all kinds of storms; it is also our Chairman Mao who led us to forge ahead bravely, dare to leap forward, and dare to win, whenever the revolution entered a new high tide. History has proven that Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership is the decisive guarantee for the continuous victory of our country's revolution and construction.

    Comrade Mao Zedong is a brilliant, creative Marxist, and a great, outstanding Marxist theorist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism, proceeding from the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and made enormous theoretical contributions in all aspects, such as the theory of the proletariat's leadership in the democratic revolution; the theory of the peasant question in the democratic revolution and the establishment of rural revolutionary base areas; the theory of military, revolutionary war, and strategic issues; the theory of the revolutionary united front; the theory of building the Party; the theory of colonial, semi-colonial national questions and domestic national questions; the theory of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce; the theory of class struggle during the transition period; the theory of the problem of contradictions among the people; the general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" and the theory of taking agriculture as the foundation, giving priority to the development of heavy industry in combination with the rapid development of agriculture; the theory of putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements; the theory of the base and superstructure, objective laws and the subjective dynamic role of people; the theory of the unity of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development; the theory of the people's commune; the theory of the proletarian revolutionary cultural movement, the socialist cultural revolution, the "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in science and culture; the theory of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor; the theory of the transition from socialism to communism; the theory of imperialism, and so on. In short, Comrade Mao Zedong has made many new and valuable contributions to the treasure house of Marxism, whether in philosophy, political economy, or scientific socialism.

    Mao Zedong Thought is the highest crystallization of the wisdom of the people of all nationalities in our country, the criterion for all our work, and the lighthouse that illuminates our path forward. The glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action. The victory of our Party, the victory of the cause of revolution and construction in our country, is the triumph of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. It is the greatest honor and happiness for our entire Party and the people of all nationalities in the country to have such a great and wise leader as Comrade Mao Zedong and such great thought as Mao Zedong Thought.

    The liberation of all ethnic minorities in our country and the unprecedented leap forward in political, economic, and cultural fields, and the exceptionally smooth resolution of domestic ethnic issues in our country, are the glorious victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has always treated the liberation and development of the people of all nationalities in our country as a unified whole. Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us that whatever problems we consider or whatever things we do, we must proceed from the 650 million people of the whole country, take overall consideration, and make appropriate arrangements. Whether on revolutionary or construction issues, he has always based his decisions on the actual situation and the greatest interests of the people of all nationalities in our country (Han nationality and every ethnic minority). Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's line and basic policies formulated according to Mao Zedong Thought have universal significance for our country's nationalities, and are completely correct and appropriate for any nationality in our country. This is because it reflects the laws of development of human society, reflects the fundamental and common interests and demands of all nationalities in our country, as well as the common struggle experience of all nationalities. For decades, the people of all nationalities in our country have precisely followed the Party's general line in various revolutionary periods and adhered to the Party's basic policies in various periods, and only then have they achieved the great victories of democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and only then have they achieved the liberation and development of the people of all nationalities.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently emphasized the need to correctly handle national issues. In the process of leading the people of all nationalities in our country to jointly carry out democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, he most fully estimated the factor of national issues, was best at examining and taking care of the national characteristics of all ethnic minorities, and most successfully led and united all nationalities to fight for the common cause of revolution and construction. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of using the principles of Marxism-Leninism on national issues to correctly solve domestic national issues is an important component of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and an important aspect of Comrade Mao Zedong's creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

    Regarding the domestic national issues of our country, Comrade Mao Zedong has a consistent and most basic thought, which is to unite and unite all nationalities in the country under the leadership of the Communist Party to jointly carry out revolutionary struggles, establish a unified family of the motherland, implement thorough national equality in the family of the motherland, implement national regional autonomy, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities to jointly build socialism and communism. Comrade Mao Zedong's basic thought is the result of his profound Marxist analysis of the historical development of our country, the specific characteristics of national relations in our country, and the epochal background of our revolution. It is the highest expression of the greatest interests of the people of all nationalities in our country. It is the highest guiding ideology for our Party's work in domestic national issues, and the fundamental key to determining the smooth resolution of domestic national issues in our country. In the practice of solving domestic national issues, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism on national issues, the theory of the proletarian national view and the class essence of national issues, and put forward a series of creative theories and policies, such as the theory and policy of national unity and cooperation, mutual assistance, and the Han nationality vigorously helping the progress and development of ethnic minorities; the theory and policy of realizing thorough national equality, respecting the equal status and equal rights of ethnic minorities, and respecting the customs and languages of ethnic minorities; the theory and policy of implementing national regional autonomy within a unified country under the centralized leadership of the Central People's Government, guaranteeing and respecting the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities, one ethnic minority can establish one, two or more autonomous areas, two or more ethnic minorities can jointly autonomously govern, national autonomous areas can include a large number of Han people, and implement the principle of national equality in national relations within autonomous areas; the theory and policy of cultivating communist cadres of ethnic minorities and establishing the Communist Party among ethnic minorities; the theory and policy of establishing revolutionary armed forces among ethnic minorities; the theory and policy of adopting forms and methods suitable to the characteristics of each nationality to realize democratic reforms and socialist transformation of nationalities with different social and economic structures; the theory and policy of developing industry in ethnic minority areas and cultivating the working class ranks of ethnic minorities, developing agriculture, protecting and developing animal husbandry, and implementing mutual support and integration of agriculture and animal husbandry; the theory and policy of developing the languages of ethnic minorities and helping ethnic minorities create and reform writing systems; the theory and policy of developing the population of ethnic minorities; the theory and policy of establishing an upper-level united front among ethnic minorities and patriotic democratic people under the leadership of the Party; the theory and policy of freedom of religious belief; the theory and policy of constantly raising the socialist, communist, and patriotic awareness of the people of all nationalities, opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and so on.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's general line and various basic policies for revolution and construction in our country, and his theories and policies on domestic national issues, not only solved the common problems of all nationalities, but also solved the particularity problems of all ethnic minorities. The two are closely linked and inseparable. In the ethnic minority areas of our country, it is inconceivable to achieve great victories in revolution and construction as well as national unity and cooperation if the Party's general line and various basic policies in various periods are not resolutely implemented; and it is equally impossible to achieve this victory if the Party's ethnic policies are not resolutely implemented at the same time.

    We must systematically study and repeatedly delve into all of Chairman Mao's works. At present, we should first focus on studying and publicizing Mao Zedong's theories on socialist economic construction and the people's communes. The Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies are the concentrated embodiment of Mao Zedong's theory on socialist economic construction and the transition to communism, and should be studied particularly carefully; at the same time, we should study Mao Zedong's theory on class struggle during the transition period, and the theory of the unity of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development. These are directly related to our current actual struggle. Only by studying Chairman Mao's theories well can we better handle current problems and do our current work well. In order to fundamentally understand Mao Zedong Thought, we must earnestly study Mao Zedong's theories on world outlook and methodology. Representative works in this area include "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Among them, we should first devote ourselves to studying Chairman Mao's doctrine on the unity of opposites, which is the best key to guiding us in understanding problems and doing our work well. Comrades in ethnic minority areas and those in ethnic work positions must also study Chairman Mao's theories and policies on national issues, which is also necessary for doing current work well in ethnic minority areas.

    For decades, Comrade Mao Zedong has constantly and earnestly taught us: Marxism-Leninism is a guide to action. We should learn from Marx and Lenin the stand and method of observing and solving problems, and should not just learn the words of Marxism-Leninism. When we study Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's works, we must first learn Chairman Mao's ideological method and style of integrating theory with practice. We must link the study of Chairman Mao's works with solving the actual problems in our current work, repeatedly and earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, strive to understand its essence, link it with practice, and guide practice. We must learn and do at the same time, learn in doing, and do in learning. In this way, we can both do our work well and learn the theory well. There is no other way to learn Mao Zedong Thought well besides this.

    In order to launch a large-scale movement of studying and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought in ethnic minority areas and to deepen this study movement step by step, all localities must strengthen theoretical work and vigorously cultivate theoretical teams. In recent years, the theoretical work in ethnic minority areas of our country has made great progress; however, with the rapid development of economic and cultural construction, there is still an urgent need for further strengthening. The situation in ethnic minority areas is the same as in the rest of the country. Social productivity is in a new era of unprecedented great leaps forward and great development. The vigorous practice of production and construction has raised many new issues for us. Studying and researching Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to solve these problems in a timely and correct manner, is of great importance for promoting the continuous progress of socialist construction in ethnic minority areas. We must train a group of Marxist-Leninist theoretical teams. All theoretical workers must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the path of being both red and expert, and being thoroughly red and deeply expert, exert great effort, strive for the upstream, and adapt the propaganda and research work of theory to the development of production and construction, and realize a great leap forward in theoretical work. Mao Zedong Thought has developed in the struggle against various forms of opportunism, revisionism, and other various erroneous ideas. Throughout the transition period, various styles of bourgeois ideology will continue to attack and influence us. We must resolutely criticize those reactionary and erroneous ideas and fight to defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the model of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Only in this way can our theoretical work become lively and vigorous.

    Studying and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought is a long-term and major task for us, a major task related to the victorious construction of socialism and the transition to communism by all nationalities in our country. The study of Mao Zedong Thought must be diligent and arduous, and must be persistent. As long as we work hard and persevere, we will definitely be able to learn it well.

    认真学习毛泽东思想广泛宣传毛泽东思想
    乌兰夫
    现在在全国范围内掀起的学习和宣传毛泽东思想的高潮，具有伟大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。各少数民族中的共产党员和广大干部以及一切在少数民族中进行工作的同志们都应该积极地投入这一个学习运动中来，进一步认真地、系统地钻研毛主席著作，深入地学习和广泛地宣传毛泽东思想，以便更进一步提高自己的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，提高马克思列宁主义理论水平，更进一步作好自己的工作。在各少数民族的广大人民群众中，也应该广泛地开展这一个学习运动。听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，我们就会无往而不胜，我们各少数民族地区的革命和建设事业就能够更加顺利，比现在更加高速度地、不断地向前发展。
    毛泽东同志是中国革命的伟大舵手，是我国各民族人民无限热爱的伟大领袖。在中国几十年来的翻天复地的革命斗争中，毛泽东同志以他无比坚定的无产阶级立场，崇高的大无畏的共产主义风格，杰出的马克思列宁主义的理论修养和高瞻远瞩的科学预见，领导我国各民族人民，从胜利走向更大的胜利。毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践紧密结合起来，使马克思列宁主义的伟大真理在六万万五千万人的大国中得到了胜利，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。在我国民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个时期，首先提出党在各个时期的总路线和一整套的方针政策，从而引导我们在不断革命中不断取得胜利的，是我们的毛主席；几十年来，一贯坚持正确的路线，领导全党同各种机会主义、修正主义进行了不调和的坚决斗争，从而保卫了党的路线、党的原则和党的事业的，是我们的毛主席；几十年来，每当革命遇到了困难，遭到了风险，以至形势很危险的关头，教导我们透过现象，把握实质，坚定信心，排除困难，在各种风浪中领导我们胜利前进的，是我们的毛主席；每当革命进入新的高潮的时候，领导我们奋勇向前，敢于跃进，敢于胜利的，也是我们的毛主席。历史证明了，毛泽东同志的领导，是我国革命和建设事业不断胜利的决定性的保证。
    毛泽东同志是天才的创造性的马克思主义者，是当代伟大的杰出的马克思主义理论家。毛泽东同志创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的原理，从中国革命和建设的具体实践出发，在各个方面作出了巨大的理论贡献，例如关于无产阶级在民主革命中领导权的理论；关于民主革命中的农民问题和建立农村革命根据地的理论；关于军事、革命战争和战略问题的理论；关于革命统一战线的理论；关于建设党的理论；关于殖民地、半殖民地民族问题和国内民族问题的理论；关于对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的理论；关于过渡时期阶级斗争的理论；关于人民内部矛盾问题的理论；关于社会主义建设总路线，及一整套的“两条腿走路”和以农业为基础，优先发展重工业与迅速发展农业相结合的理论；关于政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的理论；关于基础和上层建筑，客观规律和人的主观能动作用的理论；关于不断革命论与革命发展阶段论统一的理论；关于人民公社的理论；关于无产阶级的革命文化运动，社会主义的文化革命，科学文化上的“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的理论；关于教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的理论；关于社会主义向共产主义过渡的理论；关于帝国主义的理论，等等。总而言之，毛泽东同志无论在哲学、政治经济学和科学社会主义方面，都为马克思主义宝库作出了许多新的宝贵的贡献。
    毛泽东思想是我国各民族人民智慧的最高结晶，是我们进行一切工作的准则，是照耀我们前进的灯塔。以毛泽东同志为首的光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党以马克思列宁主义作为自己行动的指南。我们党的胜利，我国革命和建设事业的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利。我们能有毛泽东同志这样伟大的英明的领袖，能有毛泽东思想这样伟大的思想，是我们全党和全国各民族人民最大的光荣和幸福。
    我国各少数民族的解放和在政治、经济、文化各方面史无前例的飞跃发展，我国国内民族问题的异常顺利的解决，是毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利。
    毛泽东同志从来是把我国各民族人民的解放和发展的问题作为一个统一的整体来对待的。毛泽东同志经常地告诉我们说，无论考虑什么问题，办什么事情，都要从全国六万万五千万人出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排。他无论是在革命问题上和建设问题上，从来都是以我国各民族（汉族和每一个少数民族）人民的实际情况和最大利益作依据的。因此毛泽东思想以及根据毛泽东思想制定的党的路线和基本政策，对我国各民族具有普遍意义，无论对于我国那一个民族来说都是完全正确的、适当的。因为它反映了人类社会发展的规律，反映了我国各民族的根本的、共同的利益和要求，以及各民族共同的斗争经验。几十年来我国各民族人民，正是沿着党在各个革命时期的总路线，遵循着党在各个时期的基本政策，才取得了民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，才获得了各民族人民的解放和发展的。
    毛泽东同志一贯强调必须要正确处理民族问题。他在领导我国各民族人民共同进行民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，最充分地估计了民族问题这个因素，最善于考察和照顾各少数民族的民族特点，最成功地领导和团结各民族为共同的革命和建设事业进行斗争。毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义的民族问题的原理来正确地解决国内民族问题的思想是伟大的毛泽东思想的一个重要组成部分，是毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的一个重要方面。
    关于我国国内的民族问题，毛泽东同志有一个一贯的、最基本的思想，就是在共产党的领导下，联合与团结全国各民族共同进行革命斗争，建立统一的祖国大家庭，在祖国大家庭内，实行彻底的民族平等，实行民族的区域自治，充分调动各民族人民的积极性，共同建设社会主义和共产主义。毛泽东同志这一基本思想是他关于我国历史的发展、我国民族关系的具体特点和我国革命的时代背景进行了深刻的马克思主义分析的结果，是我国各民族人民最大利益的最高表现，是我们党在国内民族问题方面进行工作的最高指导思想，是决定我国国内民族问题得以顺利解决的根本关键。毛泽东同志在解决国内民族问题的实践中，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的原理，关于无产阶级民族观和民族问题的阶级实质的理论，提出了一系列的创造性的理论和政策，例如关于各民族团结合作，互相帮助，汉族大力帮助少数民族进步和发展的理论和政策；关于实现彻底的民族平等，尊重少数民族的民族平等地位和民族平等权利，尊重少数民族的风俗和语言文字的理论和政策；关于在统一的国家内、在中央人民政府集中领导下实行民族区域自治，保障和尊重少数民族的自治权利，一个少数民族可以建立一个、两个或两个以上的自治地方，两个以上的少数民族可以联合自治，民族自治地方可以包括大量的汉人，在自治地方内的民族关系上贯彻民族平等原则的理论和政策；关于培养少数民族的共产主义干部和在少数民族中建立共产党的理论和政策；关于在少数民族中建立革命武装的理论和政策；关于采取适合各民族特点的形式和方法实现社会经济结构不同的各民族的民主改革和社会主义改造的理论和政策；在少数民族地区发展工业和培养少数民族的工人阶级队伍，发展农业，保护与发展畜牧业，实行农牧业互相支援、互相结合的理论和政策；关于发展少数民族的语言文字、帮助少数民族创制和改革文字的理论和政策；关于发展少数民族人口的理论和政策；关于在党的领导下在少数民族中和爱国民主人士建立上层统一战线的理论和政策；关于宗教信仰自由的理论和政策；关于不断地提高各民族人民的社会主义、共产主义和爱国主义的觉悟，反对大汉族主义和地方民族主义的理论和政策，等等。
    毛泽东同志关于我国革命和建设的总路线和各项基本政策，关于国内民族问题的理论和政策，不仅解决了各民族共同的问题，也解决了各少数民族的特殊性的问题，这两者是密切联系而不可分割的。在我国各少数民族地区，如果不是坚决贯彻了党在各个时期的总路线和各项基本政策，要取得革命和建设以及民族团结合作的伟大胜利是不可思议的；而如果不是同时坚决贯彻了党的民族政策，这种胜利的取得也同样是不可能的。
    我们必须系统学习、反复钻研所有毛主席的著作，在当前，我们应该首先抓紧学习和宣传毛泽东同志关于社会主义经济建设问题和人民公社的理论。党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是毛泽东同志关于社会主义经济建设和向共产主义过渡理论的集中体现，尤其必须认真地进行学习；同时应当学习毛泽东同志关于过渡时期阶级斗争的理论，关于不断革命和革命发展阶段论统一的理论。这些都是与我们当前的实际斗争直接联系的，只有学好毛主席的这些理论，我们才能更好地处理当前的问题，做好当前的工作。为了从根本上学通毛泽东思想，我们必须认真学习毛泽东同志关于世界观和方法论的理论，在这方面具有代表性的著作，就是“实践论”、“矛盾论”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，在其中应该首先致力于学习毛主席关于对立的统一的学说，这是指导我们认识问题，做好工作的一把最好的钥匙。各少数民族地区和在民族工作岗位上的同志，还必须学习毛主席关于民族问题的理论和政策，在少数民族地区，这同样是做好当前工作所必需的。
    几十年来，毛泽东同志经常不断地谆谆教导我们：马克思列宁主义是行动的指南，应当学习马克思、列宁观察问题和解决问题的立场和方法，而不应当只是学习马克思列宁主义的词句。我们学习毛泽东思想，学习毛主席著作，必须首先学习毛主席这种理论联系实际的思想方法和作风。我们必须把学习毛主席著作和解决我们当前工作中的实际问题联系起来，反复认真地学习毛主席著作，努力领会它的精神实质，联系实践，指导实践，一边学、一边作，作中学、学中作，这样我们就既能做好工作，又能学好理论，舍此之外，是没有学好毛泽东思想的门径的。
    为了在各少数民族地区掀起一个声势浩大的学习和宣传毛泽东思想的运动，并且把这个学习运动逐步深入下去，各地都必须加强理论工作，大力培养理论队伍。我国各少数民族地区的理论工作，近几年来有了很大的发展；但是，随着经济、文化建设事业的迅速发展，还迫切地需要进一步加强。各民族地区的形势同全国一样，社会生产力正处在空前大跃进大发展的新时代，蓬蓬勃勃的生产建设实践，给我们提出了许多新的问题，学习和研究毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想及时而正确地解决这些问题，对于推动各少数民族地区的社会主义建设不断前进是有重大作用的。我们一定要培养一批马克思列宁主义理论队伍。一切理论工作人员，都必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，沿着又红又专、红透专深的道路，鼓足干劲，力争上游，使理论的宣传研究工作同生产建设的发展相适应，实现理论工作的大跃进。毛泽东思想是在同各种机会主义、修正主义以及其他各种错误思想的斗争中发展起来的。在整个过渡时期，各种样式的资产阶级思潮还是会不断地来攻击和影响我们的，对于那些反动和错误的思想，我们必须进行坚决的批判，为保卫马克思列宁主义和马克思列宁主义同中国革命实践相结合的典范的毛泽东思想而斗争，也只有如此，才能使我们的理论工作生动活泼起来。
    学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是我们一个长期的重大任务，是一个关系到我国各民族胜利建成社会主义进而过渡到共产主义的重大任务。对于毛泽东思想的学习，必须刻苦努力，还必须持之以恒，只要我们下苦功，并且坚持下去，我们是一定可以学得好的。
