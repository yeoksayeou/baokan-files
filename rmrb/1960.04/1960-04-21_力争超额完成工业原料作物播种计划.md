    Strive to Overfulfill the Sowing Plan for Industrial Raw Material Crops

    Taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development is our guiding principle for developing agricultural production. While expanding grain production, arranging the sowing area for industrial raw material crops is a crucial key to achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward in this year's agricultural production. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," many people's communes have made appropriate and rational arrangements for the planting plans of both grain crops and industrial raw material crops, ensuring the sowing area of grain crops while also completing the sowing plans for industrial raw material crops. However, some regions and some people's communes have not fully arranged the planting plans for industrial raw material crops, and some people's communes even plan to reduce the planting area for industrial raw material crops, which should arouse our special attention. Party committees at all levels and people's communes in various regions should take all appropriate and effective measures to ensure the completion of the state's planting plan for industrial raw material crops.

    Industrial raw material crops are an important component of agricultural production, with many varieties, wide uses, and high economic value of products. Industrial raw material crops are not only the main source of raw materials for light industry and the necessities of daily life for the vast majority of people, but many are also important export commodities. The main products of industrial raw material crops have high utilization value, and their by-products such as roots, shoots, stalks, peels, and residues also have many uses. Taking cotton as an example, cotton is the most important industrial raw material crop. Its main product, cotton wadding, is the main raw material for the textile industry and the main raw material for solving people's clothing problems. In addition, cottonseed can be pressed for oil, and oil residue is the raw material for making soap. Cottonseed hulls are also important chemical raw materials, and cotton stalks can be used to make paper and fiberboard. Cotton stalk peels can also be used to replace hemp for making ropes. It can truly be said that the whole plant is a treasure. Therefore, planting various industrial raw material crops, especially various types of cotton, can not only develop light industry and further meet the needs of the daily lives of the vast majority of people, but also increase public accumulation in the commune, increase the income of commune members, and expand export trade to support national construction. In recent years, thanks to the attention of party committees at all levels, the production of industrial raw material crops has greatly developed. Cotton production has increased from 8.89 million dan in 1949 to 48.2 million dan last year, an increase of more than four times. As of 1958, sugarcane had increased more than four times compared to 1949, sugar beets had increased more than fourteen times, and flue-cured tobacco had increased more than seven times. Other industrial raw material crops have also increased to varying degrees. However, with the comprehensive and sustained great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the rapid development of science and culture, and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demand for industrial raw material crop products is also increasing. Therefore, the production of industrial raw material crops must have a greater development to meet the growing objective needs.

    Developing the production of industrial raw material crops must also adhere to the principle of combining planting more varieties and harvesting more with achieving high yields and harvesting more. Whether this principle can be thoroughly implemented depends first and foremost on whether enough area can be sown and the sowing quality can be improved during the sowing season. Since last winter, various regions have been carrying out spring sowing preparation work centered on water, soil, and fertilizer, laying a material foundation for a bumper harvest of various crops. Currently, various regions also attach great importance to sowing quality, which plays a significant role in promoting the increased production of various crops, including industrial raw material crops. However, this alone is not enough; it is even more important to expand the sowing area. Increasing yield per unit area and expanding the sowing area are two inseparable aspects of increasing total output, and expanding the area is the basis for increasing production. Only with a certain area can we strive to increase the yield per unit area and increase the total output. Therefore, in spring plowing and sowing, people's communes must take all crops into consideration and make reasonable arrangements. While expanding the sowing area of grain crops, they must also appropriately expand the sowing area of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, oilseeds, hemp, tobacco, and sugar. Only by sowing enough and sowing well industrial raw material crops can we increase the production of industrial raw materials and meet the needs of all aspects.

    Whether the state's prescribed planting plan for industrial raw material crops can be successfully completed depends on whether people correctly understand the important role of industrial raw material crops in developing the rural economy and promoting the entire national economic construction; it depends on the determination and meticulous and in-depth work of leaders at all levels; and it depends on whether we can further develop the superiority of the people's commune's large scale and high degree of public ownership to make comprehensive and rational overall arrangements. Of course, planting more grain crops and planting more industrial raw material crops will inevitably lead to a certain degree of conflict between various crops competing for land, fertilizer, and labor. The fact that the planned sowing area for industrial raw material crops has not been fully implemented in a few places is the result of not properly resolving this contradiction. Grain is an indispensable and important material for national construction and people's livelihood. It is entirely right for various regions to first expand the grain sowing area and ensure the rapid increase in grain production. However, the socialist construction undertaking is carried out according to plan and in proportion. It requires not only more grain, but also more textiles and more other industrial raw materials; the needs of people's lives are also multifaceted. If we only care about grain and ignore cotton and other industrial raw material crops when arranging agricultural production, we cannot achieve the requirement of all-round development. The correct approach should be to appropriately expand the grain sowing area and also appropriately expand the cotton and other industrial raw material crop area, ensuring the all-round increase in production of various crops and ensuring the needs of all aspects of national construction and people's lives. Doing so will, of course, encounter certain difficulties, such as difficulties in arranging the planting area. However, as long as people can emancipate their minds, think of more ways, and use all available land, the problem can be solved. First, there is a lot of wasteland in our country. Whether in the north or the south, inland or border areas, there are many large or scattered pieces of wasteland. As long as we earnestly reclaim them, we can increase a lot of cultivated land. This year, Shunde County in Guangdong Province expanded the planting of 20,000 mu of grain and 50,000 mu of industrial raw material crops simply by reclaiming wasteland. According to incomplete statistics, in the past winter and this spring, more than 50 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in 20 provinces and regions across the country, which provides us with good conditions for expanding the sowing area of various crops and further implementing the principle of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of various crops. Second, is to make use of small pieces of land at the edges of fields, around houses, and save the use of existing cultivated land. There is also great potential to be tapped in this area. Zhiqian Commune in Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, found more than 3,900 mu of land that could be used from thirteen aspects such as digging fish ponds, building water conservancy projects, expanding sites, and building pig farms, accounting for about 12% of the commune's cultivated land area. According to statistics from Chuansha County in Shanghai, there are about 20,000 mu of "ten-edge" land that can be used in the county, such as field edges, pond edges, and house edges, equivalent to about 6% of the county's cultivated land area. Third, reforming farming techniques and increasing the multiple cropping index is one of the important measures to expand the planting area and ensure multiple planting and full planting. There are also many advanced experiences in this area. This year, Taicang County in Jiangsu Province seized the opportunity to change single-season crops to double-season crops, implement intercropping and relay cropping, promote multiple cropping a year, and plant extensively on the "ten edges." The county's planting area has expanded by more than 200,000 mu on the basis of expanding by 120,000 mu last year, and the multiple cropping index has increased from 208% to 230%. It is worth noting that the above-mentioned areas have always been considered areas with a large population and little land and a high land utilization rate. So much usable land can still be discovered in these areas, and there must be a lot of potential to be tapped in other areas. As long as we think of ways from multiple aspects, the problem of insufficient land can be solved; as long as we further develop the superiority of the people's commune's large scale and high degree of public ownership, make comprehensive planning and overall arrangements for various crops, plant those crops that are suitable for planting on scattered small pieces of land on the "ten edges," plant those crops that are suitable for planting on newly reclaimed wasteland on newly reclaimed land, and solve those crops that are suitable for multiple cropping and intercropping with multiple cropping and intercropping, we can completely free up the land needed for industrial raw material crops and completely successfully complete or even overfulfill the sowing plan for industrial raw material crops.

    Planting more and planting well will inevitably make the already tense labor force even more tense as the workload increases. However, like the land problem, as long as we give full play to the superiority of the people's commune's large scale and high degree of public ownership, rationally arrange farm work and labor, improve labor organization, and especially vigorously carry out tool reform, this problem can also be completely solved. Fuling Commune in Pucheng County, Fujian Province, is a good example. Due to the expansion of the spring sowing and spring harvest area, this commune originally calculated that it would be short of more than 300,000 workdays in the two months from March to early May. In order to complete the spring sowing and spring harvest plan with guaranteed quality and quantity, this commune comprehensively carried out a tool reform movement. They successively manufactured and promoted more than 1,500 pieces of machinery for transplanting rice, sowing seeds, and applying fertilizer, increasing work efficiency by six to seven times, saving more than 260,000 workdays in this item alone. In addition, with rational arrangements for sowing time, organized collaboration, and improved quota management, labor efficiency has significantly improved and the amount of labor used has been greatly reduced. Now, this commune not only does not lack labor, but also has a surplus of more than 40,000 workdays to strengthen intensive cultivation and expand the spring sowing area. Under the leadership of the Party, a movement across the country in which people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life support agriculture is developing vigorously, and the process of agricultural technological transformation has been greatly accelerated. As long as we strengthen leadership and mobilize the broad masses of peasants to vigorously carry out tool reform and vigorously carry out agricultural technological revolution, the labor problem can be appropriately solved.

    The failure to implement the sowing plan for industrial raw material crops in a few areas is a specific problem and also a relatively complex problem. There are both ideological problems and practical difficulties. Party committees at all levels should seize the opportunity of spring sowing and conduct a general inspection of the planting of industrial raw material crops. Solve whatever problems are found during the inspection. Through this inspection, ensure that the planting plan area for industrial raw materials such as cotton, oil, hemp, tobacco, and sugar, etc., is fully implemented and fully realized like that of grain crops. In the inspection, for industrial raw material crops that have not yet been sown or have just begun to be sown, check whether the entire plan has been implemented down to the team and the field, whether seeds and fertilizers have been prepared fully, and whether labor has been properly arranged. Quickly implement what has not been implemented, quickly prepare what has not been prepared, and immediately rearrange what has not been arranged properly. For industrial raw material crops that have basically completed sowing, conduct area verification work. If there is a shortage, try every means to make up for it. For crops whose area has been sown fully, also check whether there are any missing seedlings or missing rows. Resolutely check and replenish as you go. Not only must there be sufficient area, but there must also be complete seedlings to ensure increased production.

    Increasing the production of industrial raw material crops is a major issue related to whether agricultural production can continue to leap forward better and more comprehensively, and it also has a great relationship to the completion of the entire 1960 national economic plan. Farmers across the country and all rural work cadres must make their best efforts to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the sowing area for industrial raw material crops.

    力争超额完成工业原料作物播种计划
    以粮为纲、全面发展，是我们发展农业生产的方针。在扩大粮食生产的同时，安排好工业原料作物的播种面积，是胜利实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进的一个重要的关键。很多人民公社在党的“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针指导之下，都对粮食作物和工业原料作物的种植计划作了妥善合理的安排，既保证了粮食作物播种面积，也完成了工业原料作物的播种计划。但是，有一部分地区和一部分人民公社还没有完全安排好工业原料作物的种植计划，甚至有些地方的人民公社，还有缩小工业原料作物种植面积的打算，这是应该引起我们特别重视的问题。各级党委，各地人民公社应该采取一切妥善有效的措施，保证国家关于工业原料作物种植计划的完成。
    工业原料作物是农业生产中一个重要的组成部分，种类多，用途广，产品的经济价值也高。工业原料作物不单是轻工业原料的主要来源，不单是广大人民日常生活的必需品，很多还是重要的出口物资。工业原料作物的主要产品利用价值高，它的根、梢、秆、皮、渣等副产品，也有很多的用途。拿棉花来说，棉花是头等重要的工业原料作物，它的主要产品棉絮是纺织工业的主要原料，是解决人民穿衣问题的主要原料，除此以外，棉籽可以榨油，油渣又是制造肥皂的原料，棉籽壳还是重要的化工原料，棉秆可以造纸、作纤维板，棉秆皮又可以代替麻类作绳索等，真可算全身都是宝了。因此，多种工业原料作物特别是多种棉花，不仅可以发展轻工业，进一步满足广大人民日常生活的需要；并且可以增加公社公共积累，增加社员收入；还可以扩大出口贸易，支援国家建设。几年来，由于各级党委的重视，工业原料作物的生产有了很大的发展，棉花从1949年的八百八十九万担增加到去年的四千八百二十万担，增长四倍多。截至1958年为止，甘蔗比1949年增长四倍多，甜菜增长十四倍多，烤烟增长七倍多。其他工业原料作物也都有不同程度的增长。但是，随着工农业生产的全面持续大跃进，科学文化事业的迅速发展，人民生活水平的逐步提高，各方面对工业原料作物产品的需要也越来越多，因而工业原料作物的生产还必须有个更大的发展，才能满足日益增长的客观需要。
    发展工业原料作物的生产，也必须坚持多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针。这一方针能否彻底贯彻，首先要看在播种时期能不能播下足够的面积并提高播种质量。各地从去冬以来就以水土肥为中心进行春播准备工作，为各种农作物大丰收打下了物质基础，目前各地又都很重视播种质量，这对于促进各种农作物包括工业原料作物的增产有很大的作用。但是，光有这一条是不够的，更重要的还是要扩大播种面积。提高单位面积产量和扩大播种面积是增加总产量不可分割的两个方面，而扩大面积更是增产的基础，只有有了一定的面积，再去努力提高单位面积产量，才能提高总产量。因此，各人民公社在春耕播种中，对各种农作物必须统筹兼顾，合理安排，在扩大粮食作物播种面积的同时，也必须适当地扩大棉花和油麻烟糖等工业原料作物的播种面积，把工业原料作物播足、播好，才能多增产一些工业原料，满足各方面的需要。
    能不能保证国家规定的工业原料作物种植计划胜利完成，关键在于人们对于工业原料作物在发展农村经济和推动整个国民经济建设中的重要作用的认识是否正确；在于各级领导干部的决心和细致深入的工作；在于能否进一步发展人民公社一大二公的优越性进行全面地合理地统筹安排。当然，既要多种粮食作物，又要多种工业原料作物，不可避免地会出现一定程度的各种作物互相争地、争肥、争劳力的矛盾。目前有少数地方工业原料作物的播种计划面积还没有完全落实，就是还没有很好地解决这种矛盾的结果。粮食是国家建设和人民生活不可缺少的重要物资，各地首先扩大粮食播种面积，保证粮食迅速增产，是完全应该的。但是，社会主义建设事业是有计划按比例进行的，它既需要更多的粮食，也需要更多的纺织品，也需要更多的其他工业原料；人民生活的需要也是多方面的，如果我们在安排农业生产时，只顾粮食不顾棉花和其他工业原料作物，就不能达到全面发展的要求。正确的做法，应当是既适当扩大粮食播种面积，也适当扩大棉花和其他工业原料作物面积，保证各种作物全面增产，保证国家建设和人民生活各方面的需要。这样做，当然是会遇到一定的困难的，比如安排种植面积就有困难。但是，只要人们能够解放思想，多想办法，利用一切可以利用的土地，问题是可以解决的。首先，我国荒地很多，不管北方还是南方，内地还是边疆，到处都有很多成片的或者零星的荒地，只要认真开垦，就可以增加很多耕地。广东顺德县今年单是开荒就扩种了二万亩粮食和五万亩工业原料作物；据不完全的统计，去冬今春全国二十个省区已开垦荒地五千多万亩，这就给我们扩大各种作物的播种面积，进一步贯彻以粮为纲，各种作物全面发展，提供了很好的条件。其次，是利用田头地角、房前屋后的零星土地和节约使用现有的耕地，这方面也有很大潜力可挖。江苏金坛县指前公社，从开挖鱼塘、兴修水利、扩大场地、修建猪场等十三个方面找出了可以利用的土地三千九百多亩，约占全社耕地面积的12％左右。另据上海市川沙县统计，全县可以利用的田边、塘边、宅边等“十边”土地约有二万亩左右，相当于全县耕地面积的6％。再次，是改革耕作技术、提高复种指数，这是扩大种植面积，保证多种种全的重要措施之一。这方面也有很多的先进经验，江苏太仓县今年抓住单季改双季，实行间作套种、推行一年多熟和大种“十边”等办法，全县种植面积在去年扩大十二万亩的基础上，又扩大二十多万亩，复种指数已由208％提高到230％。值得注意的是上述这些地方，向来都被认为是人多地少，土地利用率较高的地区，在这些地区尚能挖掘出这么多可以利用的土地，其他地区也一定还有很多潜力可挖，只要我们从多方面想办法，土地不足的问题是可以解决的；只要我们进一步发展人民公社一大二公的优越性，对各种作物进行全面规划统筹安排，把那些适宜种在零星的小块土地上的作物种在“十边”，把那些适宜种在新垦荒地上的作物种在新垦出的土地上，把那些适宜用复种间作的作物用复种间作去解决，我们便完全可以腾出工业原料作物所需要的土地，完全可以胜利完成甚至超额完成工业原料作物的播种计划。
    既要种多，又要种好，本来就已经感到紧张的劳动力，随着工作量的增加必然更加紧张起来。但是，和土地问题一样，只要充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，合理安排农活和劳力，改进劳动组织，特别是大力进行工具改革，这个问题也是完全可以解决的。福建浦城县富岭公社就是做得较好的一个例子。这个公社由于春播春收面积扩大，原计算从3月到5月上旬的两个多月中，要缺少三十多万个劳动日。为了保质保量地完成春播春收计划，这个公社全面开展了工具改革运动，他们先后共制造推广了插秧、播种和施肥等机械一千五百多部，提高工效六七倍，单这一项就节省劳动日二十六万多个。再加上合理安排播种时间，组织协作和改进定额管理等办法，劳动效率显著提高，用工量大大减少。现在，这个公社的劳动力不仅不缺，而且还节余了四万多个劳动日用来加强精耕细作和扩大春播面积。在党的领导下，一个全国各族人民，各行各业支援农业的运动正在蓬勃发展，农业技术改造的进程已经大大加快，只要我们加强领导，发动广大农民群众大搞工具改革，大搞农业技术革命，劳力问题是可以得到适当解决的。
    少数地区工业原料作物播种计划没有落实，是一个具体问题，也是一个比较复杂的问题。这里面既有思想认识问题，也有实际的困难。各级党委要抓紧春播时机，对工业原料作物的种植情况进行一次普遍的检查。检查中发现什么问题，就解决什么问题。通过这次检查，务使棉花、油、麻、烟、糖等等工业原料作物的种植计划面积和粮食作物一样，全部落实，全部实现。各地在检查中，对于尚未播种和刚开始播种的工业原料作物，要检查全部计划是否已经落实到队到田，种子肥料是否已经备齐备足，劳动力是否已经安排得当？没落实的要赶快落实，没备齐的赶快备齐，安排不当的立即重新安排。对于播种基本结束的工业原料作物，要进行面积核实工作，如有短缺，要千方百计设法补齐。面积已经播足的作物，还要检查有无缺苗缺垅现象，要坚决随查随补，不光要有足够的面积，还要有齐全的苗棵，才能保证增产。
    增产工业原料作物，是关系到农业生产能否更好更全面地继续跃进的大问题，对整个1960年国民经济计划的完成也有很大关系。全国农民，全体农村工作干部，必须尽最大努力，保证完成和超额完成工业原料作物的播种面积。
