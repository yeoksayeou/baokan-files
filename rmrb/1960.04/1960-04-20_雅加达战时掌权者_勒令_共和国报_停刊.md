Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: According to a report by Antara News Agency today, the Jakarta Wartime Authority has ordered "Republic Daily" to cease publication starting April 16th.

The reason given by the Jakarta military authorities for ordering the suspension is that, since the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 10 regarding the ban on foreign retailers in rural areas, this newspaper has repeatedly published "malicious" news about overseas Chinese.

Prior to this, the Indonesian Communist Party's organ, "People's Daily," was ordered to cease publication about a month ago.

    雅加达战时掌权者
    勒令“共和国报”停刊
    新华社雅加达18日电　据安塔拉通讯社今天报道，雅加达战时掌权者已经命令“共和国报”从4月16日起停刊。
    雅加达军事当局勒令停刊的理由是，自从发布关于取缔乡村地区外国零售商的总统第十号法令以来，这家报纸一再刊登关于华侨的“别有用心”的消息。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚共产党机关报“人民日报”已在约一个月前被下令停刊。
