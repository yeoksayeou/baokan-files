Comrades and Representatives,

I fully endorse and agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I also agree with the other reports of the conference. Now, I will focus on reporting to the conference on the issue of cadres in our province going deep into work groups, comprehensively arranging the lives of commune members, and launching a high tide of spring plowing and production. Any inaccuracies, please correct me, representatives.

Hunan, like all other parts of the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the people of the province, on the basis of achieving two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, have embarked on the path of continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1960 with their heads held high.

Last winter and this spring, the winter production movement centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation achieved unprecedented victories. Last November, after the Provincial Party Committee issued the call to "Move thousands of mountains, open ten thousand miles of rivers" and "Build water conservancy, seize bumper harvests, beautify rivers and mountains," 350,000 cadres and 6 million laborers throughout the province displayed soaring enthusiasm and vigorously engaged in the winter and spring water conservancy movement. By the end of February, a total of 1.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone had been completed, equivalent to 46% of the total amount of earth and stone completed in the past ten years. Thirty thousand new reservoirs were built, 66% more than the eighteen thousand built in the past ten years, including 1,014 with dam heights of fifteen to twenty-five meters. The great victory of the water management movement has greatly changed the landscape of farmland water conservancy in our province.

The fertilizer accumulation movement proceeded apace with the water conservancy movement, achieving great results. According to statistics, the current accumulation of earth fertilizer averages more than 300 dan per mu of cultivated land, an increase of 40% over the same period last year. Grasping large-scale pig raising for fertilizer accumulation, planting green manure on a large scale, and building field fertilizer depots were the characteristics of the fertilizer accumulation movement since last winter. The province planted a total of more than 20 million mu of green manure, built more than 2.63 million new field fertilizer depots, and built and renovated 187,000 pig farms. At the same time, our province also launched a mass movement to reclaim wasteland and improve soil. People's communes throughout the province reclaimed a total of 5 million mu of wasteland and improved 8 million mu of low-yielding farmland out of more than 10 million mu with yields below 600 jin per mu.

During the winter production movement, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution emerged in rural areas and is developing towards a more widespread and deeper stage. All of this has laid a solid foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year. At present, the people of the province are advancing victoriously and launching a vigorous spring production movement centered on spring harvesting and spring plowing.

    **Work groups are the basic units of all agricultural activities**

In order to promote the comprehensive and in-depth development of the spring plowing production movement and achieve the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year, the Provincial Party Committee made a decision in February, requiring the mobilization of 100,000 cadres from party and government organs above the county level throughout the province, the People's Liberation Army, mass organizations, and full-time cadres above the brigade level of the People's Commune to go deep into the forefront of agricultural production, that is, to go deep into the work groups to participate in production and lead production. The broad masses of cadres warmly supported this decision of the Provincial Party Committee. By the end of March, more than 148,000 cadres above the brigade level throughout the province had gone deep into the work groups. Party and government organs at all levels have sent down a number of key responsible cadres.

Going deep among the masses and going deep into reality are the working style and working methods that the Party and Chairman Mao have always advocated. Only by going deep, appearing as ordinary laborers, integrating with the masses, sharing life, and breathing together can we understand the demands of the masses; only by going deep can we summarize the good experiences created by the masses in a timely manner and promote them; and only by going deep can we discover problems and solve problems in a timely manner.

In the new and excellent situation, new problems will constantly arise on the road to continued progress in achieving great results. This is the objective law of the development of all things. In rural Hunan, the work group is the basic unit of all agricultural activities, and how well various policies are implemented and how well various tasks are completed are all based on the work group. At the same time, the work groups in rural Hunan are generally combined with rural public canteens and nurseries. The work group directly contacts the masses and directly organizes the production and life of the masses. Therefore, going deep into the work group also means going deep to the bottom. Analyzing a work group, affirming achievements, summarizing experiences, discovering problems, solving problems, and guiding and promoting overall work is a good working method that Chairman Mao has always advocated. Chairman Mao once taught us: "Any work task, if there is no general and universal call, cannot mobilize the broad masses to act. But if it is limited to general calls, and the leaders do not specifically and directly implement the work called for in several organizations, break through a point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units, it will be impossible to test whether the general call they have put forward is correct, and it will be impossible to enrich the content of the general call, and there is a danger that the general call will fall through." This is a well-known truth.

    **Cadres who go deep into work groups achieve "four togethers" with the masses**

After nearly 150,000 cadres in our province went deep into the work groups, they generally achieved "four togethers," that is, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, further strengthening their ties with the masses, discovering and solving many problems in their work in a timely manner, effectively promoting spring plowing production, and creating favorable conditions for changing the face of some backward production teams and work groups. The masses reflected: "When cadres come to the group, they know everything clearly, do things reasonably, and have more energy." Wang Shuqiao, the first secretary of the Cili County Party Committee, carried a dung basket with him when he went deep into the work group to inspect production and has picked up more than a dozen loads of wild manure in recent times. Zhang Runqing, the head of Ningxiang County, went deep into a work group in the Zhuliangqiao Production Team of the Shuangjiangkou Commune. He worked with the masses during the day and guarded seedlings with them at night. For example, on the night of March 15, when a cold wave came, he personally led more than 30 commune members, braving the cold wind, to set up windbreaks and burn bonfires, working all night long to prevent damage to the seedlings. After many cadres went deep, they also worked with the masses to build experimental fields, command fields, backbone fields, and seed fields. In the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, responsible cadres at the state, county, and commune levels established these four types of fields at every level. Cadres who went deep into the work groups in Shuangfeng County launched a high tide of everyone doing experiments and everything doing experiments. The county has built more than 77,000 mu of experimental rice fields, more than 28,000 mu of experimental soil, more than 1,400 experimental canteens, more than 700 experimental pig farms, and more than 190 experimental fish farms.

The broad masses of cadres promoted the style of hard work and perseverance, adhered to the system of physical labor, integrated with the masses, participated in production, and led production, which was warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses, and directly promoted the spring plowing and production movement. Of course, this is only a new starting point. To win a greater harvest in agriculture this year and realize the forty articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, we still need to go through arduous struggles. We will guarantee to persevere unremittingly and constantly strive to make this in-depth working method a regular and universal leadership method for cadres throughout the province.

Caring for the lives of the masses is a glorious tradition of our Party. As early as 1934, Chairman Mao pointed out in "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "We are the leaders and organizers of revolutionary war, and we are also the leaders and organizers of the life of the masses." During the Great Leap Forward, after the people's communes, the Party Central Committee repeatedly pointed out that "we must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life." "The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the lives of the masses, and the more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." With proper living arrangements, production will have no worries. Production and life are interdependent and inseparable. A comprehensive arrangement of the lives of the commune members naturally requires certain material conditions, but at the same time, in-depth and meticulous ideological work and organizational work must be carried out in order to live a good life. If the leaders do not truly care about the lives of the masses and do not seriously make specific arrangements, even if the material conditions are good, they may not necessarily live well. Therefore, while organizing the continued leap forward in agricultural production, we have made relatively comprehensive and appropriate arrangements for the lives of commune members in accordance with the spirit of running the society diligently and thriftily and managing the household diligently and thriftily.

    **Running public canteens well guarantees sustained leaps forward in production**

The center of comprehensively arranging the lives of commune members is planned grain consumption. Although Hunan suffered a hundred days of drought last year, it still achieved a bumper harvest of grain. This year, grain work was grasped earlier, more solidly, and more comprehensively than in previous years, and comprehensive arrangements were made for grain purchases, rations, seeds, and feed grain. After the early rice harvest last year, we promptly grasped the need to live diligently and thriftily, implement planned grain consumption, and advocate saving grain. Since the rectification movement last winter, we have also mobilized the masses to launch a discussion on how to arrange their lives well, and the idea of "looking ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with surpluses, slow and steady progress, and leaving room for maneuver" has taken root in the hearts of the people. During this period of practice, various localities have also summarized and promoted a set of grain management systems, which are: unified management (unified management by basic accounting units, that is, brigades), in-kind distribution to the canteen (grain is allocated to the canteen on a monthly or quarterly basis), quantitative allocation according to the number of people, targets to households, and savings returned to the individual. At the same time, the method of eating more during busy farming seasons, eating less during slack farming seasons, eating both dry and thin food, and combining grain and vegetables is implemented. Because leaders at all levels attach importance to vegetable production, more than 90% of the canteens in the province can now eat more than two jin of vegetables per person per day. Facts have proved that good grain arrangements and sufficient vegetables not only make people eat their fill but also eat well. The masses are enthusiastic and have strong energy in production.

After the rural communes were established in our province, collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens were universally held. Experience has proved that vigorously running rural public canteens well is a major issue related to arranging the lives of commune members, developing production at high speed, and further consolidating the communes. This is one of our important differences with the right-leaning opportunists. In the Hunan Party, there was once a small handful of right-leaning opportunists who maliciously attacked the creation of the public canteens by the masses, and they tried their best to dismantle the public canteens in an attempt to destroy the people's communes. We carried out a serious and sharp struggle against the right-leaning opportunists, thoroughly refuted their various fallacies, enthusiastically and actively supported the new thing of public canteens, and resolutely implemented the policy of "actively running well and voluntarily participating," and adopted a series of specific measures to run the canteens well, thus making the rural public canteens more consolidated and developed. Now there are more than 417,000 canteens in the province, and the population participating in the canteens accounts for more than 99% of the rural population.

According to the specific situation in Hunan, we have set a "five-good" standard for rural public canteens, which are: planned grain consumption, saving grain, everyone eats their fill, eats economically, and eats well; sufficient firewood and vegetables, the canteen is self-sufficient in oil, salt, and money, and pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish are raised well; cooking utensils are innovated, saving manpower and materials well; cleanliness and hygiene, preventing diseases, and the commune members are in good health; democratic management, sound systems, convenience for commune members, and unity and friendship. According to statistics, more than 70% of the public canteens now reach the "five-good" or basically reach the "five-good" standard, and more than 20% reach the "four-good" or basically reach the "four-good" standard. In addition, there are about 5% of the canteens that are not yet very consolidated. Many red banner units have emerged in rural public canteens. For example, the Yingshanzui Canteen of the Jinjing Commune in Changsha County, with a total of seventeen households and sixty-six people, has not had a single household exceed the grain consumption target since the autumn harvest last year. By the end of January this year, they had saved more than 1,000 jin of grain within the quota. Their main experience is to arrange grain consumption reasonably according to the time of day, the weather, the grain, and the vegetables. Now, everyone eats three jin of fresh vegetables every day, has stored 56 jin of dried vegetables per person, and has prepared half a year's worth of firewood. This canteen has achieved semi-mechanization in the innovation of cooking utensils, and the labor intensity has been greatly reduced. What used to be done by three people is now undertaken by one person, saving two full laborers and putting them into agricultural production. The Shiniu Canteen of the Chengtan Commune in Liuyang County is also well run. For more than a year, every household in this canteen has had grain savings within the quota, and they have long insisted on eating two vegetables, a small meat dish, and a soup dish for each meal. The canteen has sufficient firewood in all seasons, and pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish are all over the place.

In order to further consolidate the rural public canteens, constantly enrich the content of the "five-good" standard, and improve the level of the canteens, various localities have adopted methods such as visits, performances, and on-site meetings to summarize and promote the experience of the red banner canteens. For the approximately 5% of canteens that are not yet fully consolidated, working groups have been sent out to rectify them in conjunction with leading production, set a time limit for changing their face, and effectively arrange the lives of the masses.

Comrades and Representatives, Hunan, like all other parts of the country, is in an extremely good situation at present. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the province are full of confidence and are striving to victoriously realize the continued Great Leap Forward this year and to realize the forty articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule!

    深入作业组与群众同生活共呼吸
    谭余保代表谈湖南省各级干部如何密切联系群众各位代表：
    我完全拥护和同意李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，并同意大会的其它各项报告。现在，我着重向大会汇报一下我省干部深入作业组，全面安排社员生活，掀起春耕大生产高潮的问题。不当之处，请代表们指正。湖南和全国各地一样，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，全省人民在取得连续两年大跃进的基础上，昂首阔步，踏上了1960年的继续大跃进的途径。去冬和今春，全省以兴修水利和积制肥料为中心的冬季大生产运动，取得了空前的胜利。去年11月，省委发出“移山千座，开河万里”、“兴水利、夺丰收、美化河山”的号召后，全省三十五万干部、六百万劳动大军，发挥了冲天干劲，大搞冬春水利运动。到2月底止，共完成土石方十一亿立方，相当于过去十年完成土石方总和的46％。新建水库三万座，比过去十年新建的一万八千座还多66％，其中坝高十五米到二十五米的有一千零十四座。治水运动的伟大胜利，大大改变了我省农田水利面貌。积肥运动与水利运动兼程并进，成绩巨大。据统计，现在积制的土肥，平均每亩耕地已达三百多担，比去年同期增加40％。大抓养猪积肥，大种绿肥和大搞田头肥库，是去冬以来积肥运动的特点。全省共种绿肥两千多万亩，新建田头肥库二百六十三万余个，新建和整修猪场十八万七千个。与此同时，我省还掀起了开荒改土的群众运动，全省人民公社共开荒五百万亩，全省亩产六百斤以下的一千多万亩耕地低产田，改良了八百万亩。在冬季大生产运动中，农村的技术革新和技术革命运动出现了高潮，正在向着更普遍更深入的阶段发展。所有这些，都为今年农业生产的继续大跃进打下了坚实的基础。目前全省人民正乘胜前进，掀起了轰轰烈烈的以春收春耕为中心的春季大生产运动。
    作业组是各项农事活动的基本单位
    为了促进春耕生产运动全面深入地发展，实现今年农业生产的继续大跃进，省委在2月间作出决定，要求从全省县以上的党、政机关，人民解放军，群众团体和人民公社大队以上的脱产干部中，动员抽调十万干部，深入到农业生产最前线，即深入到作业组去参加生产、领导生产。广大干部热烈拥护省委这一决定，到
  3月底止，全省已有十四万八千余名大队以上的干部深入到了作业组。各级党、政机关，都下去了一批主要负责干部。
    深入群众，深入实际，是党和毛主席一向提倡的工作作风和工作方法。只有深入下去，以普通劳动者的面貌出现，与群众打成一片，同生活，共呼吸，才能了解群众的要求；只有深入下去，才能及时总结群众创造的好经验，加以推广；也只有深入下去，才能及时发现问题，解决问题。在新的大好形势下，在取得巨大成绩继续前进的道路上，总会不断发生新的问题的。这是一切事物发展的客观规律。在湖南农村，作业组是各项农事活动的基本单位，各项政策贯彻得怎样，各项任务完成得好坏，都落脚在作业组。同时，湖南农村的作业组，一般都是和农村公共食堂、托儿所相结合的。作业组直接联系群众，直接组织群众的生产和生活。因此，深入作业组，也就深入到了底。通过解剖一个作业组，肯定成绩，总结经验，发现问题，解决问题，指导和推动全面工作，这是一种好的工作方法，是毛主席一向提倡的。毛主席曾经教导我们：“任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”这是至理名言。
    干部深入作业组作到和群众“四同”
    我省近十五万干部深入作业组后，一般都做到了“四同”，即与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，进一步密切了和群众的联系，及时发现和解决了工作中的许多问题，有效地推动了春耕生产，并为改变某些后进生产队、作业组的面貌创造了有利条件。群众反映：“干部到组，事事清楚，做事合理，干劲更足。”慈利县委第一书记王树桥同志，深入作业组检查生产时，随身携带粪箕，最近一段时间就拣了十几担野粪。宁乡县长张润清同志，深入到双江口公社朱良桥生产队一个作业组，白天与群众一起生产，晚上同群众一道护秧。例如3月15日晚上来了寒潮，他亲自带领三十多个社员，冒着冷风，扎防风棚，烧火堆，搞了一个通晚，避免了秧苗受到损失。很多干部深入下去后，还同群众一起，大搞试验田、指挥田、骨干田、种子田。湘西土家族苗族自治州，州、县、公社各级负责干部层层建立了这四种田。双峰县深入作业组的干部，掀起了一个人人搞试验，项项搞试验的高潮，全县共搞水稻试验田七万七千余亩，试验土二万八千多亩，试验食堂一千四百多个，试验猪场七百多个，试验鱼场一百九十多个。广大干部发扬艰苦深入的作风，坚持体力劳动的制度，与群众打成一片，参加生产，领导生产，得到了广大群众的热烈欢迎和颂扬，直接推动了春耕大生产运动。当然，这只不过是一个新的起点，要夺取今年农业的更大丰收，提前实现农业发展纲要四十条，还需经过艰巨的斗争。我们今后保证坚持不懈，不断努力，使这种深入到底的工作方法，成为全省干部经常的普遍的领导方法。
    关心群众生活，是我们党的光荣传统。毛主席早在1934年就在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中指出，“我们是革命战争的领导者、组织者，我们又是群众生活的领导者、组织者。”在大跃进中，在人民公社化后，党中央又一再指出，“必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活”。“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活，党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”生活安排妥善，生产就无后顾之忧。生产和生活是相辅相成密不可分的。全面安排好社员生活，固然要有一定的物质条件，但同时必须进行深入细致的思想工作和组织工作，才能过好日子。如果领导不真正关心群众生活，不认真去作具体安排，就是物质条件再好，往往也不一定生活得好。因此，我们在组织农业生产继续跃进的同时，根据勤俭办社、勤俭持家的精神，比较全面妥善地安排了社员生活。
    办好公共食堂保证生产持续跃进
    全面安排社员生活的中心是计划用粮。去年湖南虽然遭到了百日大旱，粮食仍然获得丰收。今年粮食工作比往年抓得早、抓得实、抓得全面，征购粮、口粮、种子和饲料粮，都分别作了全面安排。去年早稻丰收后，我们就及时抓了勤俭过日子，实行计划用粮，提倡节约用粮。去冬整社运动以来，又发动群众，开展了一次如何安排好生活的讨论，“瞻前顾后，以丰补歉，细水长流，留有余地”的思想，深入人心。在这一段实践过程中，各地又总结和推行了一套粮食管理制度，这就是：统一管理（由基本核算单位即大队统一管理），实物到堂（按月或按季把粮食拨给食堂），以人定量，指标到户，节余归己。同时实行农忙多吃，农闲少吃，有干有稀，粮菜搭配的办法。由于各级领导重视了蔬菜生产，现在全省90％以上的食堂，每人每天能吃到两斤以上的蔬菜。事实证明，粮食安排好，蔬菜又充足，不仅吃得饱，而且吃得好，群众热情高，生产劲头足。
    我省农村公社化后，普遍举办了以公共食堂为中心的集体福利事业，经验证明，大力办好农村公共食堂，是关系到安排好社员生活，高速度发展生产和进一步巩固公社的重大问题。这是我们同右倾机会主义分子的重要分歧之一。在湖南党内，曾经有一小撮右倾机会主义分子，对农村公社食堂这一群众的创举，进行过恶毒的攻击，他们千方百计拆公共食堂的台，企图搞垮人民公社。我们与右倾机会主义分子进行了严肃尖锐的斗争，彻底驳斥了他们的种种谬论，热情地积极地支持了公共食堂这一新生事物，坚决贯彻执行了“积极办好，自愿参加”的方针，采取了一系列办好食堂的具体措施，因而使农村公共食堂更加巩固发展了。现在全省共有四十一万七千多个食堂，参加食堂的人口占农村人口的99％以上。根据湖南的具体情况，我们对于农村公共食堂定了个“五好”标准，这就是：计划用粮、节约用粮，人人吃得饱、吃得省、吃得好；柴菜充足，油盐钱食堂自给，猪鸡鸭鱼养得好；炊具革新，节省人力物力好；清洁卫生，防止疾病，社员身体好；民主管理，制度健全，方便社员，团结友爱好。据统计，现在公共食堂达到“五好”或者基本达到“五好”的有70％以上，达到“四好”或者基本达到“四好”的有20％多。此外，还有5％左右暂时还不十分巩固的食堂。在农村公共食堂中，出现了许多红旗单位。例如长沙县金井公社映山咀食堂，共十七户六十六人，从去年秋收以来，没有一户超过用粮指标，到今年元月底止，在定量范围内还节余了粮食一千余斤，他们的主要经验是采取看活、看天、看粮、看菜按时合理安排用粮，现在每人每天吃到三斤鲜菜，每人已储备干菜五十六斤，并且已准备了半年的柴火。这个食堂在炊具革新上实现了半机械化，劳动强度大大减轻，原来三人做的事，现在由一人担负起来了，节省了两个全劳力，投入了农业生产。浏阳县澄潭公社石牛食堂，也办得很好。一年多来，这个食堂户户在定量范围内，有粮食节余，长期坚持了每餐吃两个蔬菜，一个小荤，一个汤菜。食堂柴火四季充足，猪鸡鸭鱼满堂红。
    为了进一步巩固农村公共食堂，不断丰富“五好”内容，提高食堂水平，各地采取了参观、表演、现场会等办法，总结和推广了红旗食堂的经验。对于5％左右还不十分巩固的食堂，已经派出工作组，结合领导生产，进行整顿，限期改变面貌，切实安排好群众生活。
    各位代表，湖南和全国各地一样，当前形势极好，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全省人民满怀信心，为胜利实现今年的继续大跃进，为提前实现农业发展纲要四十条而奋斗！
