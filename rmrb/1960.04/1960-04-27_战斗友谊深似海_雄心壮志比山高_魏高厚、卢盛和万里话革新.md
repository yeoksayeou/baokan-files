    Deep as the Sea is Our Friendship in Battle, High as the Mountains are Our Lofty Aspirations
    Wei Gaohou, Lu Shenghe Talk About Innovation
My dear comrade Lu Shenghe:

    We haven't seen each other since the National Congress of Heroes last year. After returning to the factory, I was busy with the final sprint of the year, followed by seizing the "double opening red" of New Year's Day and the Spring Festival. I couldn't even spare time to write a letter. Now the Party has issued a call to vigorously promote the "Four Modernizations" movement, so you must be very busy. However, in order to learn from your experience, I am taking the time to write this letter, hoping you can send me some "intelligence." I think you will be happy to help.

    Here, I will also tell you about our situation since we parted, especially since the beginning of this year's "opening red."

    In the first spring of the 1960s, I implemented a total of 368 innovation proposals. Among them, 39 machines were automated (9 milling machines, 16 center lathes, 13 shapers, and 1 drilling machine), 103 manual operations were mechanized, and 2 linked production lines were realized. In just over two months, I have completed 17 years and 9 months of workload, saving an estimated 68,000 yuan in value, more than 74 tons of steel, and also saving 145 labor forces. Maybe your gains are even greater, and I congratulate you on your achievements.

    Comrade Shenghe! How did you spend New Year's Day? Alas, that day was so interesting. We bid farewell to 1959 with intense labor and welcomed 1960 with joy and excitement. Because the "opening red" had been shouted out more than a month ago, I couldn't sleep on New Year's Eve after waiting for so long. Because I had something on my mind! There were many stars in the sky, so I ran into the workshop. When I got to the workshop, I checked the machines and immediately started two vertical milling machines at full speed. Although the weather was so cold, I only wore one piece of clothing and was still sweating profusely, because I was busy with this machine and then that machine. As a result, I completed the equivalent of one year's workload in one day. On this day, I also implemented twelve innovation proposals. Originally, the parts for the center lathe—the square tool holder—required eleven processes such as forging, tempering, milling, drilling, and turning, and only six pieces could be made in one day. I suggested changing it to precision casting, which reduced eight processes. One person can complete the production of the parts needed for 700 center lathes for the whole year in just three days.

    Following the New Year's Day "opening red," in order to ensure even more joy in the New Year and a red start after the holiday, with the help of veteran workers, I implemented 22 innovations on the first day back to work after the holiday.

    During the Spring Festival holiday, I knew that the commercial departments were busy. What gift should I give them? I discussed it with the comrades of our factory's model worker team, "Let's help them make improvements." So we used the holiday to help the commercial departments design several simple machines. Through everyone's joint efforts, we have successively realized meat cutters and automatic biscuit production lines, which greatly saved manpower.

    Comrade Shenghe! I also want to tell you an unpleasant thing, but please rest assured, that is, I was sick for a while and even stayed in the hospital. Fortunately, thanks to the care of the Party and the kind nursing of the medical staff, I quickly recovered my health. You think, in such a leaping era where one day equals twenty years, how could I stay in bed? When I was slightly better, I wanted to be discharged. But the doctor wouldn't allow it. What should I do? I thought of helping the hospital make improvements. I stayed in the hospital for less than twenty days, and I helped the hospital make twelve improvements, six of which had already been implemented when I was discharged. I saw that comrades who were injured on duty in the surgical ward had difficulty changing clothes and blankets, the injured were uncomfortable, and the nurses worked hard, so I helped them build a small crane. This way, it was not painful for the injured to change clothes, and the labor intensity of the nurses was reduced.

    In addition to helping the hospital make improvements, there was a lot of time, so I used it to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Do you remember that when we met in Beijing last year, Premier Zhou taught us to study philosophy well? Starting this year, the Party committee organized our factory's model worker team to study Chairman Mao's works, and I also participated in the study. How is your factory studying Chairman Mao's works? It must be a vigorous campaign! I would very much like to exchange some insights and experiences with you.

    Before this systematic study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," I also often participated in political theory studies. But when I first started learning philosophy, I was a little hesitant. I thought that with my low level of education, philosophy might be difficult to learn! Furthermore, I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough time to stick with it. But when I thought of the Premier's teachings, I wasn't afraid of anything. I had to study, I was determined to study, and I would study even if there were great difficulties. The Party wants us to be masters of our own affairs, and we must learn everything we don't know. After we made up our minds, the problem was finding time. But where was the time? It wouldn't come to us; we had to squeeze it out ourselves. I adopted the method of "seizing every opportunity, keeping the book close at hand," so that no opportunity for time would escape. During the intervals of waiting for the bus or boat to go to the city for meetings, I would take out the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and read one or two pages, even if it was just one or two lines. As long as I focused and remembered it in my heart, it would be easy. Sometimes I would try to study during the gaps when waiting for people and before meetings and before going to bed.

    Comrade Shenghe! The more I study Chairman Mao's works, the more motivated I become, and the brighter my eyes become. Don't laugh at me, I plan to write a paper before the 40th anniversary of the Party as a gift to celebrate the Party's birthday. I hope you can give me some help. So the "three treasures" I carry with me have now increased to "four treasures" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," pen, triangle ruler, notebook).

    Dear Comrade Shenghe! Two months have passed in 1960, because being sick and other work took up more than a month of my time. So I didn't do much work. There are still ten months left this year, and in these ten months, I plan to implement 1,600 innovation proposals and complete 35 years of workload. I hope you can also tell me your plans for this year. And I look forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible!

    A warm handshake!
                Your dearest comrade, Wei Gaohou, Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory
                                    March 1, 1960, in the mountain city
Dear Comrade Wei Gaohou:

    Hello! I was very excited when I received your letter from the southwest of the motherland in the northeast of the motherland! I am especially impressed by the amazing achievements you have made in such a short period of time in the first spring of the 1960s!

    Comrade Gaohou: What a coincidence that when I received your letter, it was just before the opening of the Dalian-Luda City Industrial Heroes Congress. When the Heroes Congress opened on March 16th, I read your letter at the meeting and distributed it to everyone. Our municipal party secretary and the responsible comrades of the city called on everyone to learn from you, to learn your revolutionary drive to strive for advancement and move forward at high speed. All the representatives attending the meeting expressed their heartfelt admiration and warm congratulations for your spirit of stubbornly studying Chairman Mao's works, for your achievements in conducting production and technological transformation at high speed, and for your communist style of helping others to vigorously engage in technological innovation at all times! Everyone said that they would take you as an example, learn from you, catch up with you, and strive to surpass you! Our labor models here—Liu Yiqiang, Liu Tongen, Gong Runshan, Dong Henian, Liu Yuanshan, Fang Xiuzhen, Wang Chengrui, and other comrades—have all revised their annual leap forward plans under your promotion and encouragement. Of course, I couldn't sit still anymore. On the evening of March 16th, I didn't even bother to attend the evening party. I hurried back to the factory to discuss the revised leap forward plan with all the comrades in the group. All the partners in the group proposed the battle cry of "Learn from Wei Gaohou, catch up with Wei Gaohou, and strive to surpass Wei Gaohou!" In a short time, they also put forward five innovation proposals. Everyone was so enthusiastic, and I was full of confidence. Now, I will report my revised personal plan to you. I guarantee that in the first year of the 1960s, I will implement 1,200 innovation proposals throughout the year, complete 20 years of work, and work with my partners for twelve days to take down the two automatic production lines for nuts and bolts by the end of March. Before the "May Day" festival, we will transform all fourteen existing belt lathes in our section into automatic and semi-automatic single machines in one step. I will also do everything possible to enthusiastically help all twenty-one partners in the group so that more than half of them become innovation champions. In addition, in the vigorous battle to support agriculture, I will not only make production contributions but also do one hundred good deeds in my spare time to support the "Four Modernizations" of agriculture.

    Comrade Gaohou! Let me tell you here that when we met at the National Congress of Heroes last year, I hadn't even passed junior high school yet. Now I have been promoted to high school. The Party and the state have given me the honor of being an excellent student, which is a great spur to me. I am doing everything I can to strive to become an amateur college student as soon as possible and improve my combat effectiveness! I want to advance at the same high speed as you in the cultural revolution!

    Comrade Gaohou! In the twenty-odd working days of this year, I have successively implemented eighteen major innovation proposals, which is far behind you. The workers of our factory are engaged in production during the day and innovation at night in the technological transformation movement. In order to achieve the technological transformation plan at high speed, I, like many comrades, simply moved my luggage roll to the workshop and fought day and night. In this fierce battle, I encountered many difficulties, which you must also have a lot of experience with. To achieve automation, electrification is indispensable; the lack of electrical equipment is really difficult. To be honest, in those days, I didn't even bother to eat. Wherever I went, I thought about it, and my mind was always thinking about electrical equipment. I'm not afraid of you laughing at me. When I met acquaintances, I didn't have much to say and looked a bit like a "fool." As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who have the will; nothing is easy in the world for those who persevere." When I repeatedly considered that material conditions did not allow for electrical control, I looked for other ways and researched mechanical and pneumatic aspects. Finally, at the beginning of this month, without adding any electrical equipment, I transformed a belt lathe into a semi-automatic single machine, which increased efficiency by more than double, and one person can operate two machines at the same time.

    Comrade Gaohou! In the midst of the vigorous technological revolution in our factory, the commercial departments of our Dalian-Luda City are vigorously providing follow-up services to support our technological transformation. I also often think, "How can I send some gifts to the commercial departments?" At the beginning of this month, I took the time to help the Shahekou Department Store here repair a money-counting machine. In addition, the store near our workers' dormitory has a difficult job selling fish. Weighing is easy, but stringing the fish together is a hassle. I sacrificed two nights of rest to design a semi-automatic fish-stringing machine for them. Considering that they lacked metal materials, I basically used a wooden structure, so it was simple, cheap, and easy to use.

    Comrade Gaohou! Thousands of words cannot express what I want to say to you. This year, I will read all three volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" relatively thoroughly.

    Comrade Gaohou! Under the guidance of the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us join hands and leap forward together! Strive to go to Beijing again to see the great leader Chairman Mao at the next National Congress of Heroes!
                      Your comrade-in-arms, Lu Shenghe, Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory
                            Written in the coastal city of Dalian-Luda, March 19, 1960

专栏：先进生产者的信

    战斗友谊深似海  雄心壮志比山高
    魏高厚、卢盛和万里话革新我亲爱的战友卢盛和同志：
    自去年全国群英会结束后，咱们还没见过面呢。回厂后就忙于决战年关，接着又是夺取元旦、春节两个开门红，信也顾不上写。如今党又发出号召大搞“四化”运动，想你一定很忙。但是，我为了学到你的经验，特别抽空写这封信，希望你能把“情报”送给我，我想你一定乐意帮忙的。
    在此，顺便我也就把咱们分手之后，特别是今年开门红以来的情况，给你说说。
    六十年代第一个春天，我一共实现革新建议三百六十八件。其中实现单机自动化三十九台（铣车九台、元车十六台、牛头刨十三台、钻车一台），手工操作改为机械化一百零三项，实现联动化两条。两个多月时间，我已经完成了十七年零九个月的工作量，节约价值约有六万八千元，节约钢材七十四吨多，还节省了一百四十五个劳动力。可能你比我的收获还大，我也祝贺你的成绩。
    盛和同志！元旦那天你是怎么度过的呢？唉，那天可有意思了。我们以紧张的劳动送别了1959年，又以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接1960年。因为“开门红”前一个多月就喊出来了，盼了许久总算到了，除夕晚上说什么我也睡不着。因为有心事嘛！天上星星还满多呢，我就跑进车间去了。到了车间，检查了机器，一下开动了两部立铣，全开高速。天气虽然那末寒冷，可我只穿一件衣服，还是满头大汗，因为忙了这部又忙那部。结果我以一天的时间就完成了相当一年的工作量。在这一天中，我还实现了十二项革新建议，原来元车零件——方刀架，要经过锻、回火、铣、钻、车等十一道工序，一天只能做六件。我就建议把它改成精密铸造，缩减了八道工序，一个人只用三天的时间可以完成全年七百台元车任务所需的这种零件。
    继元旦开门红之后，为了保证新春喜上喜，节后红又红，我在节后上班第一天，在老师傅的帮助下，又实现了二十二件革新。
    春节假期内，我知道商业部门是忙的，我应该给他们送什么礼物呢？我就和我们厂里标兵团的同志一道商量，“咱们给他们搞改进吧”。于是我们利用假期，帮助商业部门设计了几部简单的机器，通过大家共同努力，已先后实现有切肉机及饼干生产自动线，大大节约了人力。
    盛和同志！我还要告诉你一件不愉快的事，但请你放心，就是我病了一段时间，并且还住了医院。庆幸的是由于党的关怀和医护人员的亲切护理，使我很快的又恢复了健康。你想，在这样一个一天等于二十年的跃进时代里，我怎么能在病床上呆得住呢？当我稍微好一些的时候，我想出院。但是医生又不准出院。怎么办呢？我就想法帮医院搞改进，住了不到二十天医院，我就帮助医院搞了十二项改进，在我出院时，已经实现了六项。我看到因公负伤的同志在外科病房，换衣服换被很不方便，伤员也不好受，护理人员也辛苦，我就帮他们搞了一架小吊车，这样伤员换衣服，就既不痛苦，又减轻了护理人员的劳动强度。
    除了帮助医院改进外，还有很多时间，我就把它利用起来学习“毛泽东选集”。你还记得我们去年在北京开会时，周总理他老人家要我们好好学习哲学的教导吗？从今年起党委组织我厂标兵团学习毛主席著作，我也参加了学习。你们厂学习毛主席著作的情况怎样？也一定是轰轰烈烈的吧！很希望和你交流一些心得和经验。
    在这次系统学习“毛泽东选集”以前，我也经常参加政治理论学习。但一开始学哲学，心里还是有点虚。我想自己文化这么低，哲学这门恐不大好学吧！再者又怕时间不多，坚持不住。但我一想起总理的教导，什么都不怕，要学，下决心学，天大的困难我也要学。党要我们当家作主，什么不会我们都要学，当我们下了决心后，问题就是要找时间了。但时间在那儿呢？它不会送上门来，要自己去挤，去钻。我就采取了“见缝插针，书不离身”的办法，这样时间的空子就跑不掉。我在进城开会等车、等船的空隙，就把“毛泽东选集”拿出来看上它一、二页，那怕是一两行，甚至一两句，只要专心记在心里头，就好办了。有时等人之空和会前、睡前，我都想法学。
    盛和同志！我越学主席著作，劲头越大，眼睛就越亮堂。不怕你笑话，我打算在党的四十周年的纪念日前，写一篇论文，作为向党的生日献礼，希望你能给我一些帮助。所以我现在身上随带的“三件宝”已经增加为“四件宝”了（“毛泽东选集”、钢笔、三角板、笔记本）。
    亲爱的盛和同志！1960年又过去了两个月了，因为生病和其它工作占去了我一个多月的时间。所以我没做什么工作。今年还有十个月，在这十个月里，我打算实现革新建议一千六百件，完成三十五年的工作量。希望你能把今年的规划也告诉我。并盼望能尽快得到你的回信！
    亲切的握手！
                你最亲爱的同志重庆长安机器厂　魏高厚
                                    1960年3月1日于山城亲爱的魏高厚同志：
    你好！当我在祖国的东北收到你从祖国西南发来的信，心情非常激动！特别是你在六十年代的第一个春天短短的一段时间里，就取得了这么惊人的成绩，感到无限的敬佩！
    高厚同志：多么巧啊，当我收到你的来信的时候，正巧是旅大市工业群英大会的前夕。3月16日群英大会开幕的时候，我在会上宣读了你的来信，还把它印发给大家。我们的市委书记和市的负责同志，都号召大家向你学习，学习你这种力争上游、高速度前进的革命干劲。到会的全体代表，对你那种顽强地学习毛主席著作的精神，对你那种高速度地进行生产和技术改造的成就，对你时时刻刻帮助别人大闹技术革新的共产主义风格，表示衷心的钦佩和热烈的祝贺！大家都纷纷表示：要以你为榜样，学习你，赶上你，并且力争超过你！我们这里的劳动模范——刘义强、刘同恩、宫润山、董鹤年、刘元善、方秀贞、王成瑞等同志，全都在你的促进和鼓舞下，纷纷重新修订了全年跃进规划。当然我就更坐不住了。3月16日晚上，我连晚会也顾不得参加，急忙回到厂子，把修订的跃进计划，跟全组同志们作了商量。全组伙友都提出“要学魏高厚、赶魏高厚，力争超过魏高厚”的战斗口号，一阵光景还提出了五件革新建议，大家这样热气腾腾，我也就信心百倍。现在，我就把修改后的个人规划向你汇报一下。我保证要在六十年代的第一年里，全年实现革新建议一千二百件，一年完成二十年的工作量，并且要和伙伴们一起，奋战十二天，在3月底拿下螺帽、螺钉两条自动生产线；到“五一”节前，把我们工段现有的十四台皮带车床，全都一步登天地改造成为自动化和半自动化的单机。我还要尽一切可能，热心地帮助全组二十一名伙伴，使他们当中半数以上的同志成为革新闯将。另外，在轰轰烈烈的支援农业的战斗里，我不仅要在生产上，还要在业余时间里，为支援农业“四化”做一百件好事儿。
    高厚同志！在这里顺便告诉你一下，去年在全国群英会上，我们见面的时候，我还没过初中关哩，现在我已经升入高中了。党和国家给了我优秀学员的荣誉，这对我是极大的鞭策，我正在尽一切努力，争取早日当上业余大学生，提高自己的战斗力！在文化革命方面也要和你一样的高速度前进！
    高厚同志！我在今年的二十几个工作日里，先后实现了较重大革新建议十八件，这比起你来差的很多。我们厂职工在技术改造运动中，白天搞生产，晚上闹革新。为了高速度实现技术改造规划，我也跟许多同志一样，干脆把行李卷搬到车间里来，日夜奋战。在这场激烈的战斗中，碰到过很多困难，这你也是会有很多体会的。要搞自动化，就少不了电气化；缺少电气器材，可真叫人为难。说真的，在那些日子里、连饭都顾不得吃，走到那儿，就琢磨到那儿，满脑袋老是想着电气器材。说也不怕你笑话，遇到熟人没多的话好说，有点像个“彪子”。俗语说：“天下无难事，有志者成之；天下无易事，有恒者得之”。当我反复琢磨在电气控制方面物质条件不允许时，就另找门路，从机械和风动方面去钻研。终于在这个月初，没增添任何电气器材，把一台皮带车床改造成为半自动化的单机，提高效率一倍多，并且一个人可以同时掌握两台操作。
    高厚同志！在我们厂大闹技术革命当中，我们旅大市的商业部门，大搞跟班服务，支援我们技术改造。我也常想：“怎样送点礼物给商业部门才好？”在这个月初，我抽空找个时间，帮助我们这里的沙河口百货商店修配了一台点钞票的机器。另外，我们职工宿舍附近的商店，卖鱼工作是比较苦的，称重量还好办，把鱼串起来是个麻烦事。我就牺牲了两个晚上的休息时间，给他们设计了一台半自动的串鱼机。我考虑到他们缺少金属材料，就基本上采用木头结构，这样因陋就简少花钱，使用起来还方便。
    高厚同志！千言万语，也道不尽我要跟你说的心里话。今年内，我要把三卷“毛泽东选集”全部比较深透的阅读一遍。
    高厚同志！让我们在毛泽东思想红旗的引导下，并肩携手，共同跃进！争取在下一次全国群英会上，我们俩再次进京，去见伟大的领袖毛主席！
                      你的战友大连工矿车辆厂　卢盛和
