Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS, Moscow: Dolores Ibárruri, Chairman of the Spanish Communist Party, spoke on the 15th at a grand soiree held in Moscow by Spanish political exiles and representatives of the Moscow public to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Communist Party.

She said that the founding of the Spanish Communist Party in April 1920 was an event of historical significance. She said that our party, following the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, has tirelessly led the Spanish people in the struggle to transform Spain into a free, democratic, and independent country. She emphasized the great role played by the Communist Party in the struggle for the freedom and democracy of Spain, and said that the Franco authorities have long arrested, imprisoned, tortured, and tormented the fighters for the liberation of Spain.

Ibarruri condemned the war preparations carried out by the Adenauer neo-Nazis - militarists with the encouragement of imperialism. She called on the Spanish people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of West German warmongers and Franco elements. She pointed out that the Franco elements have turned Spain into a haven for war criminals and a strategic base for world imperialism.

Ibarruri emphasized that the current international situation, especially the great achievements of the socialist camp, is conducive to the struggle of the Spanish Communists and all working people against the Franco dictatorship.

Subsequently, a congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party was read out at the meeting.

Ustinov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke at the soiree on behalf of the Moscow City Party organization of the CPSU and all working people. He pointed out that with the support of U.S. imperialism, the Hitler followers in Madrid are colluding with West German revanchists and other most reactionary foreign groups, and are carrying out frantic suppression of the Spanish people, especially the Communists.

Ustinov said that we, together with progressive people of all countries, warmly support the heroic struggle of Spanish democrats and patriotic people.

The meeting also adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party and a letter of thanks to Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, thanking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people for their assistance to the Spanish Communist Party and the people.

This newspaper reports: Two hundred and thirteen Spanish overseas Chinese who recently returned to their homeland from the Soviet Union recently wrote letters to Franco, the Chairman of the Spanish Legal Association, the Chairman of the Spanish Red Cross, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the Chairman of the International Red Cross, lodging a strong protest with Franco regarding the illegal arrest and barbaric treatment of Spanish overseas Chinese who returned in February by the Spanish authorities.

This group of Spanish overseas Chinese who returned from the Soviet Union in February were interrogated like criminals upon arrival in Spain, and each person was forced to wear a numbered tag on their chest. After arriving at their place of residence, they were subjected to a series of interrogations by the police. Although the returning Spanish overseas Chinese each had their own expertise, they could not find work. Initially, they were issued restricted documents, which were only replaced with ordinary documents after they refused to accept them. The Spanish authorities not only failed to issue travel documents to the returning overseas Chinese, but also failed to guarantee their freedom and secrecy of communication.

    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：西班牙共产党主席伊巴露丽15日在西班牙政治流亡者同莫斯科公众代表为庆祝西班牙共产党成立四十周年在莫斯科举行的盛大的联欢晚会上讲话。
    她说，西班牙共产党在1920年4月的成立是一件具有历史意义的事件。她说，我们的党遵循着马克思列宁主义学说，不倦地领导着西班牙人民为把西班牙变成为一个自由、民主和独立自主的国家而斗争。她强调指出共产党在争取西班牙的自由和民主的斗争中所起的巨大作用，并且说，佛朗哥当局长期以来把争取解放西班牙的战士逮捕入狱，拷打并折磨他们。
    伊巴露丽谴责阿登纳新纳粹——军国主义分子在帝国主义的鼓励下进行的备战活动。她号召西班牙人民提高警惕，反对西德战争贩子和佛朗哥分子的阴谋。她指出，佛朗哥分子已经把西班牙变成为战犯的避难所和世界帝国主义的战略基地。
    伊巴露丽强调指出，目前的国际形势，特别是社会主义阵营的巨大成就，有利于西班牙共产党人和全体劳动人民反对佛朗哥独裁政权的斗争。
    接着，在会上宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会致西班牙共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会第一书记乌斯季诺夫代表莫斯科市的苏共党组织和全体劳动人民在晚会上讲话。他指出，在美帝国主义的支持下，马德里的希特勒信徒们正在同西德复仇主义者和其他最反动的外国集团进行勾结，对西班牙人民，首先是对共产党人进行疯狂的镇压。
    乌斯季诺夫说，我们和各国进步公众一道热烈支持西班牙民主人士和爱国志士的英勇斗争。
    会上还通过了致西班牙共产党中央委员会的贺电和致苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫的感谢信，感谢苏联共产党和苏联人民给予西班牙共产党和人民的帮助。
    本报讯　二百十三位由苏联回祖国的西班牙侨民最近曾写信给佛朗哥、西班牙法律协会主席、西班牙红十字会主席、联合国秘书长和国际红十字会主席，就2月回国的西班牙侨民遭到西班牙当局非法逮捕和野蛮的待遇一事向佛朗哥提出强硬抗议。
    这批由苏联归国的西班牙侨民是在2月间归国的，他们一到达西班牙就遭到了像对罪犯一样的审问，每个人的胸前都被迫挂上编号的牌子。到了居住点后，又受到了警察的一系列的审讯。虽然回国的西班牙侨民都各有专长，但却找不到工作。起初只发给他们有限制的证件，后来在他们拒绝接受后，才发给普通证件。西班牙当局不仅不发给归国侨民的旅行证件，就是他们通信自由和秘密也没有得到保障。
