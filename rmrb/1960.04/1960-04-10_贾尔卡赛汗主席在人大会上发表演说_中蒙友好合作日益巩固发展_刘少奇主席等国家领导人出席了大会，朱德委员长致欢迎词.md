Today, we invite all the comrades of the delegation to participate in our meeting, and we first express our warm welcome to the distinguished guests.

Chairman Zhu De said: Comrade Jalkhaajav is an outstanding political activist of the Mongolian People's Republic, the first Mongolian Ambassador to China, and an old friend of the Chinese people. During his tenure as Ambassador to China, the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples has been further developed. Last year, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country visited the Mongolian People's Republic. Thanks to the warm reception and proper arrangements by Comrade Jalkhaajav, the delegation's visit achieved complete success. We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to him.

Chairman Zhu De concluded: We firmly believe that this visit of the Mongolian Great People's Khural delegation will further strengthen the ties between the parliaments of the two countries, enhance the fraternal friendship between the two peoples, and be conducive to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Chairman Zhu De then invited Comrade Jalkhaajav to deliver a speech.

In his speech, Chairman Jalkhaajav, on behalf of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Mongolian people, extended sincere and warm greetings to the delegates of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and wished the Congress great achievements. He said that under the wise leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made profound and enormous transformations in the socio-economy in a short period of time, turning their country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry and developed agriculture. The Mongolian people feel heartfelt joy at the great achievements of China's socialist construction. The Mongolian people are fully confident that the great Chinese people, encouraged by the tremendous achievements in the cause of socialist construction, will surely successfully complete the 1960 plan for the development of the national economy, which is being discussed at this meeting.

Chairman Jalkhaajav said that the prestige of the People's Republic of China, one of the world's great powers, has become higher and more consolidated on the international stage than at any time in the past, and occupies an important position in determining modern international policy.

Chairman Jalkhaajav said that the peace-loving Mongolian people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic fully support the great efforts made by the government of the People's Republic of China and the fraternal Chinese people to safeguard world peace and security and develop friendly cooperation between countries.

He said that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, with the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and relying on their own hard work, the Mongolian people have transformed their country from a backward pastoral country into an agricultural-pastoral-industrial country.

He said that the Mongolian people are not afraid of the various obstacles and difficulties encountered in the construction cause, and are mobilizing all their strength to work confidently to make the motherland develop more rapidly and to fulfill the tasks of the three-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture in 1960.

Chairman Jalkhaajav said that the working people of Mongolia and China have been neighbors since ancient times and have a deep friendship. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the true fraternal friendly cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples began, and it has been developing more and more each year on the basis of the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism. Trade and economic relations between our two countries have been developing more and more each year, and cultural exchanges and activities of mass delegations have also become more frequent. The friendship associations established by the public of our two countries play an important role in further consolidating the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples.

On behalf of the Mongolian people and the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, Chairman Jalkhaajav expressed heartfelt and deep gratitude to the Chinese people and government for the economic and technical assistance they have given to the Mongolian people. He said that the fraternal friendly cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples is a vivid manifestation of the firm unity and socialist cooperation among the countries of the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and it will surely be increasingly consolidated and developed in the future.

Chairman Jalkhaajav's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

After the speech, Chairman Zhu De expressed his gratitude to Chairman Jalkhaajav. At this time, everyone stood up and once again burst into stormy applause, expressing their high respect to all the distinguished Mongolian guests.
