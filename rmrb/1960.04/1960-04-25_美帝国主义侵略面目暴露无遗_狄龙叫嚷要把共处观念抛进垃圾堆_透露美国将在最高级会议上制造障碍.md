Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon delivered a speech on U.S. foreign policy at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations' "World Affairs Conference" on the 20th, openly expressing opposition to "peaceful coexistence" between countries with different social systems.

In this speech, Dillon repeatedly played the old tune of slandering the Soviet Union's "communist expansionist ambitions" while shouting to throw the idea of coexistence "into the trash heap."

Dillon could not completely deny the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals. He said that there were many indications that the Soviet Union "hoped to ease the danger of a major war." He also said that in order to "maintain peace," efforts should be made to "deal reasonably" with the Soviet Union. However, he shouted that "'coexistence' is a word that is both terrible and hateful," and "let us throw this temporary, unnatural concept of coexistence into the trash heap." He nakedly stated that the United States wants to act as a world policeman and dominate the world. He said, "In today's world, even the most basic view of living and letting others live is completely insufficient. We must live ourselves and help others live."

He emphasized the need to "seek a well-ordered world family," the way to achieve this is by establishing "a universally recognized system of international law within the framework of the United Nations" according to the interests of U.S. world domination, and establishing an "international body" under U.S. control "to enforce this law and resolve disputes arising under this law," and to establish an "international force" for this purpose. He said, "These are the ways we want to achieve the ultimate goal of building a more orderly world."

Dillon emphasized that "the first thing" the United States "needs to do" is to continue to "maintain and strengthen" its military strength and the various aggressive military blocs it has pieced together.

Dillon also devoted a large part of his speech to the upcoming East-West summit conference in Paris. He said, "The central issue facing the summit conference is the German question, including the Berlin question," and "no other issue is more critical than this one." Dillon stated that the United States "is willing to consider temporary arrangements to ease tensions in Berlin and reduce current dangers." However, he indicated that the United States would not change its stubborn position of insisting on continuing to occupy West Berlin.

Dillon also rejected, in an overbearing tone, the legitimate reasons put forward by the Soviet Union for demanding the normalization of the situation in West Berlin. He denied that West Berlin was within the territory of the German Democratic Republic. He even absurdly claimed that West Berlin was already a "free city" because it was outside the socialist camp. He also absurdly claimed that the abnormal situation in Berlin was none other than the fact that the people of East Berlin were "forced to live under a totalitarian regime illegally imposed by a foreign country," and that this "abnormal situation" could only be eliminated through "free elections" throughout Germany, and so on.

Dillon also used the failure of the East-West summit conference to blackmail the Soviet Union into accepting the United States' unreasonable position on the West Berlin issue.

He issued the threat that if the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic were forced to take action to normalize the situation in West Berlin in the event that the United States refused to change the status of West Berlin, "then there would be no hope of achieving the goals of disarmament and comprehensive improvement of East-West relations," and even "the most serious of all issues may be involved: peace or war."

Dillon also said, "It would be too optimistic to insist that the prospects for an early agreement (at the summit conference) are bright."

Dillon's speech was delivered after the Western foreign ministers had just discussed their attitude towards the East-West summit conference in Washington. This shows the attitude of the U.S. government towards the East-West summit conference.

    美帝国主义侵略面目暴露无遗
    狄龙叫嚷要把共处观念抛进垃圾堆
    透露美国将在最高级会议上制造障碍
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：美国副国务卿狄龙20日在美国劳联—产联“世界事务会议”上发表关于美国外交政策的演说，公开表示反对不同社会制度国家“和平共处”。
    狄龙在这篇演说中一面重弹诬蔑苏联“共产主义扩张野心”的老调，一面叫喊要把共处观念“扔进垃圾堆”。
    狄龙不能完全否认苏联的和平主张。他说，有许多迹象表明，苏联“希望缓和大战的危险”。他也说什么为了“维护和平”，要设法同苏联“合理来往”。但是他叫喊“‘共处’这个字眼是既可怕又可恶的”，“让我们把这种暂时的、不自然的共处观念抛进垃圾堆”。他赤裸裸地表明美国要以世界宪兵自居，称霸世界。他说，“在今天的世界上，连自己活也让他人活的这种最起码的观点也完全不够了。我们必须自己活而且帮助他人活下去”。
    他强调要“寻求一个秩序井然的世界大家庭”，办法是按照美国独霸世界的利益“在联合国范围内设立一套普世公认的国际法制度”和设立一个在美国控制下的“国际机构来执行这种法律和解决在这种法律下面发生的争端”，并且为此而建立一支“国际部队”。他说，“这些就是我们想实现建立一个比较有秩序的世界这一最终目标的办法”。
    狄龙强调，美国“首先需要做的事情”是继续“保持和加强”它的军事力量和它所拼凑的各种侵略性军事集团。
    狄龙还在演说中以很大篇幅谈到即将在巴黎举行的东西方最高级会议。他说，“最高级会议面临的中心问题就是包括柏林问题在内的德国问题”，“没有什么别的问题比这个问题更危急的了”。狄龙表示，美国“愿意考虑缓和柏林紧张局势和减少目前危险的临时安排”。但是，他表明，美国丝毫也不改变西方国家坚持要继续占领西柏林的顽固立场。
    狄龙还用蛮横的口吻一一拒绝了苏联提出的要求使西柏林局势正常化的正当理由。他否认西柏林是处在德意志民主共和国领土之内的，他甚至胡说，西柏林由于处在社会主义阵营之外，所以已经是一个“自由城市”了，而柏林局势的不正常不是别的，却是所谓东柏林人民“被迫在一个外国所非法强加的极权政权下生活”，这种“不正常局面”只能通过全德的“自由选举”才能消除等等。
    狄龙还以使东西方最高级会议失败来讹诈苏联接受美国在西柏林问题上这种无理的立场。
    他发出这样的威胁：如果苏联和德意志民主共和国在美国拒不改变西柏林地位的情况下被迫采取使西柏林局势正常化的行动，“那么裁军和全面改善东西方关系的目标就没有实现的希望”，甚至“可能涉及一切问题中最严重的问题：和平或战争”。
    狄龙还说，“硬说（最高级会议）早日达成协议的前景光明，那将是太乐观了。”
    狄龙这篇演说是在西方国家外长刚在华盛顿讨论了对于东西方最高级会议的态度以后发表的。这表明了美国政府对东西方最高级会议的态度。
