    The Historical Traces of the Hungarian People's Struggle
    ——After Reading "The Liberation of the Motherland"
    Jiang Dong
    The Hungarian people are a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition. For thousands of years, in order to defend national independence and freedom, countless large-scale people's uprisings and revolutionary movements have erupted. In 1919, the first republic in Hungarian history, the Hungarian Soviet Republic, was established. This was also the first practice of the Hungarian Communists in establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. At that time, it received close attention from Comrade Lenin, and the working people all over the world were encouraged by it. This young people's republic went through one hundred and thirty-three days of heroic struggle, and was finally overthrown due to the armed intervention of foreign imperialism and the internal and external collaboration of domestic counter-revolutionary forces; however, the Hungarian people have continued to strive to rebuild their true motherland at all times.
    The Hungarian people's ideal was finally realized. Fifteen years ago, the Soviet Red Army defeated the German fascist army and liberated the people of all European countries who had suffered from the ravages and enslavement of the Hitler bandits from the abyss of suffering. It was also possible for the Hungarian people to overthrow the domestic fascist dictatorship, get rid of being a puppet state of Germany at the mercy of others, and, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party, unite the patriotic forces of all strata of the country to establish their own people's state.
    This liberation struggle of great historical significance is vividly described in the third novel "The Liberation of the Motherland" by the contemporary Hungarian writer Irés Béla, realistically reproducing the historical features of the time. The author not only personally participated in this war to liberate the motherland, but was also a participant in the 1919 revolution, so he has a deeper understanding. If we combine Irés Béla's first two novels, "The Tisza River is Burning" and "Carpathian Rhapsody," with "The Liberation of the Motherland," these three massive works totaling more than 1.5 million words will form a broad and magnificent picture of the modern Hungarian revolutionary movement, showing the arduous and tortuous path taken by the Hungarian working people under the leadership of the Party towards revolutionary victory.
    "The Liberation of the Motherland" was written in 1953. The novel begins in the spring of 1943, when the Soviet army broke through the Voronezh front, and the German army was defeated and retreated in a panic, not hesitating to put its Hungarian "allies" to death in order to stop the Soviet army from advancing. It was here that thousands of Hungarian soldiers first came into contact with the internationalism and humanitarianism of the proletariat: the Soviet army not only saved their lives, but also provided them with food and transported them to the rear. Why did they invade Soviet territory with weapons, and yet the Soviets treated them this way? This was not something they could immediately understand after being subjected to long-term anti-Soviet propaganda by the ruling group. Only after the Party's patient education and countless factual explanations did they gradually realize that what they were going to do—fighting back to Hungary to liberate the motherland—was a part of the common liberation cause of the working people of the world.
    The novel describes the role played by the old soldiers of the first proletarian dictatorship era in Hungary, the Hungarian volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War, the Party's underground workers, guerrillas, and the tens of thousands of workers and peasants who put on military uniforms in this struggle, and also portrays the process of progressive intellectuals' understanding and action towards the revolution. They united around the Party and converged into a powerful force.
    In this novel, the author repeatedly reveals that imperialism has never relaxed its anti-people conspiracy activities, from the Anglo-American delay in opening up the second battlefield to sending spies to carry out sabotage, which is a series of actions by international counter-revolutionary forces. Some senior military officers in the old army were forced to agree to cooperate with the people due to the pressure of the situation, but they were not willing to do so. They were always ready to ride on the heads of the people and act arbitrarily. Therefore, although the novel describes the eve of the national liberation of Hungary, readers can clearly foresee that this does not mean that the cause of "liberating the motherland" has been completed, and there are more arduous combat tasks ahead. The counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956 proved this point.
    Today, the Chinese people, together with the Hungarian people, celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary with great joy. Reading Irés Béla's epic describing the liberation struggle at this time can help us to deeply understand the Hungarian people and their heroic struggle. Now, we are excited to see that our Hungarian brothers, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, have withstood severe tests and have made further great victories. This is the best sequel written by reality itself for this novel.

    匈牙利人民的斗争史迹
    ——《祖国的光复》读后
    江东
    匈牙利人民是一个有着光荣革命传统的民族，千百年来，为了捍卫国家的独立与自由，曾经爆发过无数次大规模的人民起义和革命运动。1919年，在匈牙利的历史上成立了第一个人民共和国——匈牙利苏维埃共和国，这也是匈牙利共产党人建立无产阶级专政的第一次实践，当时受到列宁同志的密切注视，全世界劳动人民也为之欢欣鼓舞。这个年轻的人民共和国前后经过一百三十三天的英勇斗争，最后由于国外帝国主义的武装干涉和国内反革命势力的里应外合而被颠复了；然而，匈牙利人民无时无刻不在继续为着重建自己真正的祖国而奋斗。
    匈牙利人民的这一理想终于实现了。十五年前，苏联红军击溃了德国法西斯军队，把欧洲遭受希特勒匪徒蹂躏和奴役的各国人民从水深火热中解放出来。匈牙利人民也有可能推翻国内的法西斯独裁统治，摆脱掉作为德国仆从国任人宰割的命运，在共产党的坚强领导下，团结国内各阶层的爱国力量，建立了人民自己的国家。
    这一具有巨大历史意义的解放斗争，在匈牙利当代作家伊雷什·贝拉的第三部长篇小说《祖国的光复》里，有着非常生动的描述，真实地再现了当时的历史面貌。作者不但亲身参加了这一次解放祖国的战争，也是1919年革命的参加者，所以更有深切的体会。如果我们把伊雷什·贝拉的前两部长篇小说——《蒂萨河在燃烧》和《喀尔巴阡山狂想曲》跟《祖国的光复》这三部长达一百五十余万字的巨著合起来看，便会构成匈牙利近代革命运动一幅宽广宏伟的图景，显示了匈牙利劳动人民在党领导下走向革命胜利所经历的艰巨曲折的途径。
    《祖国的光复》写成于1953年。小说开始的时候，是在1943年春天，苏联军队突破了沃龙?什战线，德军狼狈溃退，不惜把自己的匈牙利“盟军”置于死地以阻挡苏军前进。就在这里，几千名匈牙利军人第一次接触到了无产阶级的国际主义和人道主义精神：苏联军队不但拯救了他们的生命，还供给他们食粮并把他们输送到后方去。为什么他们拿了武器侵入苏联的国土，而苏联人还要这样对待他们呢？这一点，在长期受了统治集团的反苏宣传之后，他们不是一下子就能认识到的。只有经过了党的耐心教育和无数事实的说明，他们才逐渐觉悟过来，终于明白了他们将要做的事——打回匈牙利去解放祖国，正是全世界劳动人民共同的解放事业的一个部分。
    小说描写了匈牙利第一次无产阶级专政时代的老战士、参加过西班牙内战的匈牙利志愿者、党的地下工作者、游击队员以及千千万万穿上了军装的工农群众在这场斗争中所起的作用，也刻划了进步知识分子对于革命从认识到行动的过程。他们团结在党的周围，汇合成了一支强大的力量。
    在这本小说里，作者一再揭示出，帝国主义从来没有放松过他们反人民的阴谋活动，从英美迟迟不开辟第二战场到派遣间谍进行破坏，是国际反革命势力的一系列行动。而旧军队中的一些高级军官们，迫于时势，不得不答应与人民合作，并不是心甘情愿的，他们随时准备重新骑在人民的头上作威作福。因此，小说虽然写到了匈牙利全国解放的前夕，但读者可以清楚地预料到，这不等于“光复祖国”的事业已经完成，前面还有着更为艰巨的战斗任务。1956年10月的反革命叛乱，就证明了这一点。
    今天中国人民跟匈牙利人民一起，以万分欢欣的心情庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年，这时来读伊雷什·贝拉这本描述解放斗争的史诗，更能帮助我们深刻地认识匈牙利人民和他们英勇的斗争。现在，我们兴奋地看到，我们的匈牙利兄弟们在社会主义工人党的领导下，经受住了严重的考验，进一步取得了巨大的胜利，这是现实本身给这本小说写下的最好的续篇。
