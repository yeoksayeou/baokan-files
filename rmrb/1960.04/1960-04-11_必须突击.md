Must Launch a Shock Attack
	Lí Fū

Today, this newspaper published two news items that share a common theme, which is quite thought-provoking. The coal mines in various parts of Hunan Province have launched a vigorous mass movement to prevent and control flooding during the rainy season, breaking the conventional pattern of reduced production during the rainy season in previous years. The coal output in the first quarter of this year increased by more than 60% compared to the same period last year. Guizhou Province has launched an unprecedented upsurge in railway construction, with nearly 200,000 workers working hard to build roads. Three inter-provincial trunk lines and more than ten local railways are under construction simultaneously, with rapid progress. It seems that at certain times, adopting the method of shock attacks, concentrating superior forces to solve the key issues at hand, is still a necessary and good method.

The vigorous development of the technical revolution movement has led to significant advancements in coal, transportation, and other enterprises. However, from the perspective of the overall development of the national economy, these remain weak links. Obviously, we cannot slow down the development speed of the national economy to wait for the weak links to catch up. Instead, we must strengthen the weak links to achieve a higher level of balance. Since the weak links have fallen behind the situation, their development speed cannot be the usual speed, but must be the speed of the Great Leap Forward. The leadership's method of tackling weak links cannot be a steady and conventional approach, but must be a revolutionary, shock attack approach. Within a certain period, we must concentrate manpower, financial resources, and material resources on one point, launch a large-scale mass movement, push a task to a new stage, and raise the weak links to an advanced level. The facts of the Great Leap Forward tell us that every shock attack leads the development of things to a new leap. Without shock attacks, the backward cannot advance, and there will be no Great Leap Forward. Shock attacks and non-shock attacks are a unity of opposites. In nature, there are gentle breezes and drizzles, as well as fierce winds and storms. In production, shock attacks are often needed. Therefore, using the method of shock attacks to build railways on a large scale, launch coal battles, and全民办电 (the whole people run electricity) etc., is in line with the laws of development of things.

People's practical experience is that the method of shock attacks is an indispensable method for the Great Leap Forward. Socialist competition means that the backward must catch up with the advanced, which can only be achieved through shock attacks. Through shock attacks, we raise the level of production and construction a step higher, stabilize it at a certain new level, and then organize another shock attack. Normal - shock attack - new normal: our Great Leap Forward is spiraling upwards along this path.

To launch a shock attack, we must fully mobilize the masses, not rely on administrative orders, and not rely only on a few people. If sometimes the shock attack task is not completed, it is because the masses are not mobilized, not because of the shock attack itself. We must build railways on a large scale and run coal mines on a large scale, and we must fully mobilize the strength and wisdom of the masses to launch shock attacks on weak links.

    必须突击	黎夫
    今天本报发表了两篇消息，贯串了一个思想，十分耐人寻味。湖南省各地煤矿在雨季中，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的防水治水的群众运动，打破了历年来雨季减产的常规，今年一季度的煤炭产量比去年同期增长了60％以上；贵州省掀起了规模空前的铁路建设高潮，近二十万工人奋力筑路，三条省际干线和十多条地方铁路同时施工，进展很快。看起来，在一定的时候采用突击的方法，集中优势力量解决当前的关键，还是必不可少的一个好方法。
    技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，煤炭、运输等企业也有了很大的发展，然而，从整个国民经济发展情况来看，却仍然是个薄弱环节。显然，我们不能用降低国民经济的发展速度，来等待薄弱环节赶上来，而必须用加强薄弱环节的办法，来求得更高一级的平衡。薄弱环节既已落在形势之后，因此它的发展速度就不能是通常的速度，而必须是大跃进的速度；领导上抓薄弱环节的方法，就不能是四平八稳的方法，而必须是革命的、突击的方法，在一定时期内集中人力、财力、物力于一点，大搞群众运动，把一项工作推向新的阶段，把薄弱环节提高到先进的水平。大跃进的事实告诉我们，每一次突击都使事物的发展走向一个新的飞跃，没有突击，落后的就上不去，也就不会有什么大跃进。突击和不突击是对立的统一。在自然界中有和风细雨，也有急风暴雨，在生产方面也常常需要突击。所以用突击的方法来大修铁路，夺煤大战，以及全民办电等等，这是合乎事物的发展规律的。
    人们的实际体验是：突击的方法，就是大跃进不可缺少的方法。社会主义竞赛就是落后者要赶上先进者，这是要经过突击才能达到的。经过突击，把生产和建设的水平提高一步，并稳定在一定的新的水平上，然后再组织突击。正常——突击——新的正常，我们的大跃进就是沿着这样一条规律螺旋式上升的。
    要突击，必须充分发动群众，不能依靠行政命令，不能只依靠少数人，如果有时没有完成突击任务，这是因为不发动群众的原故，不是因为突击的原故。我们要大办铁路、大办煤矿，必须充分地发动起群众的力量和智慧，针对薄弱环节进行突击。
