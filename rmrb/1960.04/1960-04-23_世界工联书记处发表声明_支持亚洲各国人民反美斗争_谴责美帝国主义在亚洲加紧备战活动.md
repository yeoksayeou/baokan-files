　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 21st: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement today supporting the workers and trade unions of Asian countries who are struggling against the threat of American imperialism. The statement pointed out that the intensified aggression and military provocations by American imperialism in Asia are an integral part of its aggressive actions worldwide.

　　The statement pointed out that on the eve of the summit conference, American imperialism has intensified its war preparations in Asia, continuing to pursue its aggressive policy and creating incidents of armed conflict. American imperialism and the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi have concluded a US-Japan military alliance, occupied Okinawa, and strengthened US military bases there, openly shipping missile weapons into South Korea. American imperialists still forcibly occupy China's territory of Taiwan, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime.

　　The statement condemned the United States for continuously violating China's airspace and territorial waters, and for conducting large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait.

　　The statement said that in Asian countries under US military control, economic collapse, inflation, and poverty are becoming more serious.

　　The statement pointed out that puppets like Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem completely obey the dictates of their American masters, betraying national interests.

　　The statement said that American imperialism's activities and aggressive actions in Asia threaten the peace and tranquility of this region of the world and endanger the interests of the Asian people. The statement supports the struggle of the Asian people against American imperialism, and points out that "Yankee imperialism, get out of the Western Pacific!" has now become the common slogan of the Asian people.

　　The statement expressed warm support for the following demands of the Asian people: abolish the US-Japan military alliance; return Okinawa to Japan; respect the Korean and Vietnamese armistice agreements; withdraw American armed forces from the Taiwan Strait; abolish all US military bases in Asia and withdraw all American troops.

　　The statement concluded by expressing its firm belief that, with the support of trade unions and workers around the world, the workers and people of Asia will achieve victory.
