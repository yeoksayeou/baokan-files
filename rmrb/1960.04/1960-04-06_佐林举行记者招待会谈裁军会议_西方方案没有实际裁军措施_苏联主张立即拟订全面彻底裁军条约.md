Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 5th: The ten-nation disarmament committee of the East and West held a meeting on the 4th, presided over by the French representative. At the meeting, Zorin, the head of the Soviet delegation, clarified the Soviet delegation's attitude towards the future work of the disarmament committee.

After the meeting, Zorin held a press conference to introduce to reporters from various countries the contents of his speech at the ten-nation committee.

Zorin said that the Soviet delegation and the delegations of other socialist countries pointed out during the committee meetings when discussing various specific issues, that the Western disarmament plan is not at all a plan for comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and therefore does not meet the requirements of the United Nations General Assembly resolution. In the Western plan, there is neither a complete ban on nuclear weapons nor the destruction of stockpiles of such weapons, nor the cancellation of national armed forces and conventional armaments, nor the withdrawal of military bases on the territory of other countries, nor the cessation and prohibition of any military activities.

The Western plan is a plan to establish comprehensive and thorough supervision without actual disarmament measures. Any provision of this plan mainly or even completely discusses supervision, supervision without disarmament, supervision above disarmament.

The fundamental purpose of this plan is to ensure a certain unilateral military advantage for Western countries, especially the United States. Doesn't this precisely prove this point, that the plan insists on first establishing supervision over armaments that Western countries themselves admit are lagging behind the Soviet Union? The Western plan proposes measures to supervise the possible use of outer space for military purposes and to supervise long-range missiles, but does not mention at all the cancellation of military bases on the territory of other countries. This situation cannot be considered accidental.

Next, Zorin talked about a statement made by the US representative, which stated that the US wanted to limit the committee's discussion to the narrow scope of the first and second parts of the Western plan.

Zorin pointed out that the demand to only discuss one of the plans submitted to the committee for review is an attempt to put pressure on the delegations of the member states of the committee. This method will never be successful in negotiations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

Zorin said that we believe it is necessary and prepared to: begin drafting a treaty on comprehensive and thorough disarmament without delay, or first study the basic clauses and basic principles of this treaty;

	--The first task is to discuss the overall scope of comprehensive and thorough disarmament measures;

	--Determine the stages and deadlines for achieving comprehensive and thorough disarmament, so that this disarmament plan has concrete content and coherence.

	--Stipulate effective international supervision at all stages of comprehensive and thorough disarmament suitable for specific disarmament measures, so that no country can refuse to fulfill the obligations undertaken in the treaty on comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

Zorin concluded by saying that it is precisely this attitude of the Soviet Union that is in line with the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

The next meeting will be held on the 5th.

    佐林举行记者招待会谈裁军会议
    西方方案没有实际裁军措施
    苏联主张立即拟订全面彻底裁军条约
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：东西方十国裁军委员会4日在法国代表主持下举行了会议。苏联代表团团长佐林在会上阐明了苏联代表团对裁军委员会今后工作的态度。
    会议结束后佐林举行了记者招待会，向各国记者介绍了他在十国委员会上发言的内容。
    佐林说，苏联代表团和其他社会主义国家的代表团在委员会会议讨论各种具体问题时曾经指出，西方的裁军方案一点也不是全面彻底裁军的方案，因而不符合联合国大会决议的要求。在西方的计划中，既没有完全禁止核武器和销毁这种武器的储备，也没有取消各国的武装部队和常规军备，没有撤销在别国领土上的军事基地，没有停止和禁止任何军事活动。
    西方的方案是一个在没有实际裁军措施的情况下建立全面彻底监督的方案。这个方案的任何一条条款，其中所谈的主要是、甚至完全是监督，没有裁军的监督，凌驾于裁军之上的监督。
    这个方案根本的目的是为了保证西方国家，特别是保证美国某种单方面的军事优势。这个方案坚持要首先对那些西方国家自己也承认是落后于苏联的军备建立监督，这难道不正好证明了这一点吗？西方方案建议采取措施监督为了军事目的对宇宙空间的可能的利用和监督远射程导弹，但是一点也不谈到取消在别国领土上的军事基地。这种情况不能认为是偶然的。
    接着，佐林谈到美国代表发表的一个声明，这个声明说明，美国想用西方方案的第一、二部分的狭小范围来限制委员会的讨论。
    佐林指出要求只讨论提到委员会面前审查的方案之一的做法，是想给委员会各成员国代表团施加压力的一种企图。在和苏联以及其他社会主义国家的谈判中，这种方法永远也不会有结果。
    佐林说，我们认为必须并且准备做到的是：刻不容缓地开始拟订全面彻底裁军条约，或者首先研究这个条约的基本条款和它的基本原则；
    ——第一个任务是商讨全面彻底裁军措施的总范围；
    ——确定实现全面彻底裁军的阶段和期限，以便使这个裁军计划具有具体内容和连贯性。
    ——规定在全面彻底裁军的各个阶段确立适合裁军具体措施的有效国际监督，使任何一国不能拒绝履行对全面彻底裁军条约所承担的义务。
    佐林最后说，正是苏联这种态度符合联合国大会全面彻底裁军的决议。
    下次会议将在5日举行。
