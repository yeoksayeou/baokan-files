Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st — The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party today issued a letter to the South Korean people regarding the current situation in South Korea.

The letter to the South Korean people calls on all patriotic forces to unite to drive out the American aggressor troops and overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. It suggests an emergency joint conference of representatives from North and South Korean political parties and social organizations to discuss countermeasures for handling the current grave situation in South Korea. It also appeals to the people of the world to condemn and sanction all the crimes committed by American imperialism in South Korea.

The letter to the South Korean people states that the uprising of the South Korean people is an eruption of the anger accumulated over fifteen years under the tyranny of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, expressing the unanimous aspiration and determination of the entire South Korean people for liberation and freedom, for democratic rights and a new life.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The South Korean people's fierce struggle against the fascist rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique has continued for dozens of days. Following the uprising of the people of Masan, people throughout South Korea, including Seoul and Busan, have launched struggles for the right to survive and for democracy. The ruling system of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique has been shaken to its foundations.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The Syngman Rhee clique mobilized a large number of police and many troops carrying heavy weapons, massacring large numbers of people. In Seoul, a whole division was mobilized, using machine guns and rifles to shoot at young students and children demanding democracy and freedom.

The letter to the South Korean people says: Today's tragic situation is the result of fifteen years of the American aggressors' colonial plunder policy and the Syngman Rhee clique's traitorous and reactionary policies. It is American imperialism, which divides Korea and forcibly occupies South Korea, and the Syngman Rhee clique, colluding with it, that has created this situation.

The letter to the South Korean people says: If the American imperialists withdrew and the Syngman Rhee reactionary rule were abolished, Korea would have been unified long ago, democracy could have developed in South Korea, and the South Korean people would not be groaning in poverty and powerlessness as they are today.

The letter to the South Korean people recounts the sincere efforts that the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic have consistently made for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland since 1948. It also points out that all this has been rejected by American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The letter to the South Korean people says that American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique have blocked all avenues to peaceful reunification; they are pursuing a policy of instigating war and dividing Korea at the expense of the South Korean people. For fifteen years, American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique have given the South Korean people only darkness, hunger, and enslavement. Therefore, the South Korean people have risen up today, unable to endure it any longer, against the reactionary rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The South Korean people demand a new politics, a new system, a new leadership, and the rights to freedom and survival. To achieve these demands, the Syngman Rhee reactionary rule must be abolished immediately.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The brutal suppression of the uprising masses must be stopped immediately. The people's freedoms of speech, publication, association, assembly, and demonstration, and the free activities of all political parties and social organizations must be guaranteed. Those who masterminded the massacre of demonstrating masses with knives and guns must be severely punished. The "martial law" must be abolished and all those arrested must be released immediately.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The American aggressor troops must prepare to withdraw immediately, not interfere in Korean internal affairs, and not hinder contact between Koreans. The United States must be responsible for the current situation in South Korea and withdraw its troops immediately from South Korea.

The letter to the South Korean people says: As long as American imperialism continues to forcibly occupy South Korea and North-South consultation cannot be realized, no one who takes control of South Korea can save the current grave political crisis and economic bankruptcy.

The letter to the South Korean people says: Only by relying on the abundant resources and strong economic base of North Korea is it possible to restore the bankrupt economy of South Korea and fundamentally improve the tragic production situation of the South Korean people.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The unemployed in South Korea must be employed, the lives of the farmers struggling on the brink of starvation must be quickly improved, and students must attend school for free. The armies of North and South Korea must be reduced to the minimum necessary, so that they can return home to participate in peaceful labor, in order to alleviate the excessive military burden on the South Korean people.

The letter to the South Korean people says: The peaceful reunification of Korea must be realized through general elections held in North and South Korea according to the free will of all the Korean people, without any foreign interference.

The letter to the South Korean people says: Anyone with a national conscience, no matter who they are, must unite and struggle for this sacred cause. Whoever is for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, no matter who they are, must join hands and consult. Those who care about the fate of the nation and the future of the fatherland must gather together. Let us all sit down and consult, those who hope to save our South Korean compatriots from their plight and who are willing to break the current serious situation.

The letter to the South Korean people says: Workers, farmers, young students, scientific and cultural figures, entrepreneurs, and merchants, whoever you are, rise up together and carry out the struggle to save the country.

    朝鲜劳动党中央号召南朝鲜人民团结起来
    打倒李承晚傀儡政权赶走美国侵略军
    建议紧急召集南北朝鲜各政党团体代表会议商讨处理南朝鲜局势对策
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜劳动党中央委员会今天就南朝鲜目前局势发表了告南朝鲜人民书。
    告南朝鲜人民书号召一切爱国力量为了使美国侵略军撤走，为了打倒李承晚傀儡政权，团结起来，建议紧急召集南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表联席会议，讨论处理南朝鲜目前严重局势的对策；呼吁全世界人民谴责和制裁美帝国主义在南朝鲜犯下的一切罪行。
    告南朝鲜人民书说，南朝鲜人民的起义是十五年来在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的暴政下累积的愤怒的爆发，表示了全体南朝鲜人民要求解放和自由、要求民主权利和新生活的一致的志向和决心。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团法西斯统治的炽烈斗争，已经继续了数十天。在马山人民起义以后，在汉城、釜山等南朝鲜整个地区内，人民掀起了争取生存权利、争取民主的斗争。美帝国主义和李承晚集团的统治制度已经从根本上动摇了。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：李承晚集团调动大批警察，还调动了携带着大量重武器的许多军队，屠杀了众多的群众。在汉城就调动了一个师团的兵力，用机关炮和枪射击要求民主和自由的青年学生和少年儿童。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：今天的悲惨局面，是十五年来美国侵略者的殖民掠夺政策和李承晚集团的卖国反动政策的结果。造成这种局面的就是分裂朝鲜、强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义和同它相勾结的李承晚集团。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：如果美帝国主义者撤走，废除了李承晚反动统治，朝鲜早已统一了，南朝鲜的民主也能够发展，南朝鲜人民也不会像今天这样呻吟在贫穷和无权利之中。
    告南朝鲜人民书叙述了从1948年以来，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了和平统一祖国一贯进行的真诚的努力。并且指出，这一切都遭到了美帝国主义和李承晚集团的拒绝。
    告南朝鲜人民书说，美帝国主义和李承晚集团堵塞了一切和平统一的道路，他们追求的是牺牲南朝鲜人民的挑拨战争的政策和分裂朝鲜的政策。美帝国主义和李承晚集团十五年来给南朝鲜人民的只有黑暗、饥饿和奴役。因此，今天南朝鲜人民才忍无可忍地起来，反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的反动统治。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：南朝鲜人民要求新的政治、新的制度、新的领导，要求自由和生存的权利。为了达到这些要求，必须立即废除李承晚反动统治。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：必须立即停止对起义群众的残暴镇压，必须保证人民的言论、出版、结社、集会、示威的自由和一切政党、社会团体的自由活动。必须严惩用刀枪屠杀示威群众的主谋者。必须废除“戒严令”，必须立即释放一切被捕的人。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：美国侵略军队必须立即准备撤走，不能干涉朝鲜内政，不能妨碍朝鲜人的互相接触。美国必须对南朝鲜的目前局势负责，并从南朝鲜立即撤走自己的军队。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：在美帝国主义继续强占着南朝鲜、南北协商不能实现的情况下，谁掌握南朝鲜也挽救不了目前严重的政治危机和经济破产的局面。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：有只依靠朝鲜北部的丰富资源和强大的经济基础，才有可能恢复南朝鲜破了产的经济和根本改善南朝鲜人民的悲惨生产处境。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：必须使南朝鲜失业者就业，迅速改善挣扎在饥饿线上的农民的生活，让学生免费上学。必须把南北朝鲜的军队缩减到最少限度，使他们回家参加和平劳动，以减轻南朝鲜人民的过重的军费负担。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：必须在没有任何外国干涉的情况下，通过根据全体朝鲜人民的自由意志而举行的南北朝鲜总选举来实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：有民族良心的人，不论是谁，都要为这一神圣的事业团结起来进行斗争。只要是为了祖国的和平统一的人，无论是谁，都要携起手来，进行协商。关心民族命运和祖国的未来的人，都要聚于一堂。希望从水深火热中拯救南朝鲜同胞、并且愿意打开目前严重局面的人，大家一起坐下来进行协商吧。
    告南朝鲜人民书说：工人、农民、青年学生、科学文化人士、企业家、商人、不管是谁，一致起来进行救国斗争。
