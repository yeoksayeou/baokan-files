Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 19th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a speech on the evening of the 18th that "the only basis for improving relations between the U.S. government and the Cuban government is to understand our rights, respect our sovereignty, and the dignity of our nation." He said, "I don't think President Eisenhower has any right to speak in the way he recently spoke about the Cuban revolution and the Cuban government. Eisenhower said that the Cuban government betrayed the revolution. As Prime Minister, I am loyal to the revolution. In Cuba, a profound and genuine revolution is underway, which is the primary reason why many capitalist groups criticize it, and they will never approve of a genuine and just revolution."

These remarks were made by Castro last night to U.S. journalist Riccard Betts. Betts met with Castro on the 17th and asked him if he was prepared to meet with Eisenhower. Subsequently, U.S. news agencies made false reports, saying that Castro requested a meeting with Eisenhower. To expose the false reports by the U.S. news agencies, Castro met with Betts again. Castro told Betts, "I answered you, this question should be directed to Herter or Eisenhower, because they should know better. I am ready to talk to anyone. I am not requesting any meeting, and Lincoln White (U.S. State Department spokesman) should not create illusions in this regard." Castro emphasized, "I believe that those who distort my words are trying to portray the Cuban government as begging the U.S. government for some kind of favor. Their purpose in doing so is to undermine the prestige of the Cuban government, which once again demonstrates their methods of creating difficulties. They use all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to create confusion and misunderstanding."

When answering questions about the anti-communist pretext, Castro said, "Hitler and Mussolini used to start talking about communism in order to persecute all free people and various just causes. People should remember Hitler, Mussolini, and Eisenhower's friend, Mr. Franco. The only thing Franco, Mussolini, and Hitler used to say was: communism is the enemy. When they talked about communism, they were trying to defend all the crimes and aggressions they committed. And I think there is something similar in the policies of the U.S. government. The U.S. government seems to have implemented policies that were previously used to promote fascism." When answering the question of whether the revolution is currently in danger, Castro pointed out, "The revolution may have to fight and solve difficulties, but the revolution cannot be in danger because all the people are ready to defend the revolution against counter-revolutionaries and foreign interest groups. These groups are trying to oppose land reform and various revolutionary measures."

### 卡斯特罗说美国政策同法西斯主义相似  艾森豪威尔无权议论古巴革命

    卡斯特罗说美国政策同法西斯主义相似
    艾森豪威尔无权议论古巴革命
    据新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗18日晚上发表谈话说，“改善美国政府和古巴政府的关系的唯一基础是了解我们的权利，尊重我们的主权和我们民族的尊严”。他说，“我认为艾森豪威尔总统没有任何权利以他最近谈论古巴革命和古巴政府的那种方式发表谈话。艾森豪威尔说，古巴政府叛变了革命。我作为总理是忠于革命的。在古巴，正在进行深刻的和真正的革命，这是许多资本集团指责的第一个原因，他们将永远也不会赞成真正的和正义的革命。”
    这番话是卡斯特罗昨晚对美国记者里卡德·贝茨讲的。贝茨17日会见了卡斯特罗，问他是否准备同艾森豪威尔会谈，接着美国通讯社进行了虚伪的报道，说卡斯特罗要求会见艾森豪威尔。卡斯特罗为了揭露美国通讯社虚伪的报道，再次接见了贝茨。卡斯特罗对贝茨说，“我回答您，这个问题应该向赫脱或艾森豪威尔提出，因为他们应该知道得更清楚。我准备和任何人谈话。我不要求任何会见，林肯·怀特（美国国务院发言人）不应该在这方面制造幻想。”卡斯特罗强调说，“我相信，那些篡改我的话的人企图把古巴政府描绘成是向美国政府乞求某种恩惠的。他们这样做的目的是要破坏古巴政府的威信，这又一次表明了他们制造困难的方法。他们利用各种阴谋诡计制造混乱和误解。”
    卡斯特罗在回答关于反共的借口的问题时说，“希特勒和墨索里尼过去开始谈论共产主义是为了要迫害所有自由人士和各种正义事业。人们要记住希特勒、墨索里尼和艾森豪威尔的朋友佛朗哥先生。佛朗哥、墨索里尼和希特勒习惯说的唯一的东西就是：共产主义是敌人。当他们谈到共产主义的时候，他们企图辩护他们所犯下的种种罪行和各种侵略。而我认为，美国政府的政策上也存在着某种同这点相似的地方，美国政府似乎已经执行了以前用来推行法西斯主义的政策。”卡斯特罗在回答革命目前是否处于危险中的问题时指出，“革命可能必需进行战斗和必需解决困难，但是革命不可能处于危险中，因为全体人民准备好保卫革命，反对反革命分子和外国利益集团。这些集团企图反对土地改革和各种革命措施。”
