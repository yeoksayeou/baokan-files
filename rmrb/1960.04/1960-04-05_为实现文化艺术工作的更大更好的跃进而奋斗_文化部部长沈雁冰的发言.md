Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. These two reports are a combination of rigorous scientific analysis and far-reaching ideals, a combination of overall planning and key arrangements. It guarantees the resolute implementation of the General Line, and thus guarantees the continued leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production!

In the first spring of the 1960s, the garden of socialist construction in our country is truly magnificent, with a myriad of sights and a thriving scene. All aspects of our cultural front are raising the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher on the basis of the victorious leap forward of the past two years, accelerating our pace to welcome the beginning of this new era and to strive forward to better develop and create socialist culture and art.

Great Popularization, Great Improvement, Great Prosperity

Since 1958, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's cultural and artistic work has seen a situation of great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity. This marks that China's culture and art is undergoing an extremely profound socialist transformation: on the one hand, the broad masses of working people have begun to master culture and actively participate in the creation and construction of culture and art; on the other hand, cultural and artistic workers have begun to implement laborization on a full scale, closely integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thereby greatly promoting the development and prosperity of socialist cultural and artistic undertakings.

In the past two years, the cultural and artistic activities of workers and peasants have surged to unprecedented heights. Millions of working people have enthusiastically participated in various cultural and artistic activities, and used culture and art to express their soaring enthusiasm and labor passion, filled with firm confidence in building socialism and communism. Many new folk songs they created, with their fresh style and magnificent momentum, can be called the new "Guofeng" of the socialist era without any shame. Many revolutionary memoirs, factory histories, military histories, and people's commune histories compiled by professional literary and artistic workers in conjunction with workers, peasants, and cadres are inspiring, novel, vivid, and artistic biographies that have played a great educational role for the broad masses.

Professional literary and artistic workers, due to going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, participating in labor and popularizing cultural work, have greatly improved their ideological awareness and obtained rich creative sources. Therefore, not only has the quantity of literary and artistic creation greatly increased, but the ideological and artistic qualities have also significantly improved. In recent years, long novels such as "Hong Qi Pu" ("Red Flag Genealogy"), "Qingchun Zhi Ge" ("Song of Youth"), "Linhai Xueyuan" ("Tracks in the Snowy Forest"), "Bailian Cheng Gang" ("Steel is Tempered"), "Shanxiang Jubian" ("Changes in a Mountain Village"), "Chuangye Shi" ("History of Entrepreneurship"), "Kucaicaihua" ("Bitter Herbs"), "Liehuo Jingang" ("Diamond Cutters"), "Sanjia Xiang" ("Three Families Lane"), "Chengfeng Polang" ("Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves"), and "Caoyuan Fenghuo" ("Beacon Fire on the Grassland") are all relatively successful works. The abundant production of long narrative poems has become a characteristic of poetry creation. The long narrative poems "Yang Gao Zhuan" ("The Biography of Yang Gao") and "Dongdang De Niandai" ("The Turbulent Years") (Part 1 of "Fuchou De Huoyan" - "Flames of Revenge") and other lyric and political poems with diverse styles all mark that poets have taken a major step forward in creating new poetic styles by learning from new folk songs and absorbing the excellent traditions of classical poetry. Feature films produced in the past two years such as "Lin Zexu," "Qingchun Zhi Ge" ("Song of Youth"), "Fengbao" ("The Storm"), "Wanshui Qianshan" ("Across Mountains and Rivers"), "Jin Yuji," "Wuduo Jinhua" ("Five Golden Flowers"), "Wanzih Qianhong Zongshi Chun" ("A Riot of Color is Always Spring"), news documentaries "Yingxiong Zhansheng Beidahuang" ("Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness"), "Baiwan Nongnu Zhan Qilai" ("A Million Serfs Stand Up"), science and education films "Zhongguo Yuanren" ("Peking Man"), "Gaizao Ziran" ("Transforming Nature"), animated films "Yifu Tongjin" ("A Brocade of the Zhuang People"), "Meili De Xiao Jinyu" ("The Beautiful Little Goldfish") have all been well received by the broad audience. In representing the revolutionary struggles and modern life of the working people, drama not only vividly reflects the pulse of the great era, but also achieves new achievements in the creation of national style, and the performance level of drama has also greatly improved. "Jiang Long Fu Hu" ("Taming Dragons and Subduing Tigers"), "Hong Qi Pu" ("Red Flag Genealogy"), "Dongjin Xuqu" ("Overture to the Eastern Advance"), "Huaishu Zhuang" ("Locust Tree Village"), "Kumu Fengchun" ("Withered Trees Meet Spring") and other dramas performed in the February drama festival in some provinces and cities all have their own styles on the common basis of nationalization and popularization. New operas such as "Keshan Hongri" ("Red Sun on Keshan Mountain"), "Honghu Chiweidui" ("Red Guards of Honghu Lake"), "Chunlei" ("Spring Thunder"), and "Liang Dai Ren" ("Two Generations") mark that the excellent tradition of "Baimao Nü" ("The White Haired Girl") is being further developed. Music such as "Shehuizhuyi Hao" ("Socialism is Good"), "Liang Shanbo yu Zhu Yingtai Violin Concerto" ("Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto"), "Gada Meilin" (symphonic poem), "Xingfu He Da Hechang" ("Happiness River Chorus"), dance dramas "Buxiu De Zhanshi" ("Immortal Warriors"), "Baolian Deng" ("Lotus Lantern"), "Wuduo Hongyun" ("Five Red Clouds"), "Yumeiren" ("The Mermaid"), dances "Kuaile De Luosu" ("Happy Luosu"), "Fengshou Le" ("Harvest Joy"), "Huasan Wu" ("Umbrella Dance") are all relatively successful works. Many new artistic flowers have also appeared in painting, sculpture, folk art, shadow puppetry, marionettes, acrobatics and other aspects. China's traditional opera art has been newly developed, not only performing many excellent traditional plays that have been reformed, but also performing many modern-themed plays; some older operas have also tried to perform modern-themed plays and achieved initial success. In short, the literary and artistic creation of the past two years has shown valuable originality in the practice of nationalization and popularization, and has achieved remarkable results.

In the past two years, various cultural and artistic undertakings have greatly developed. By the end of 1959, the number of film screening units in the country had reached 14,500, an increase of 22 times compared with 1949; the number of troupes had increased to 3,500, and the number of theaters had increased to 2,500; in 1959, there were 456 kinds of newspapers above the prefecture level in the country, with a total annual circulation of more than 4.8 billion copies; there were 859 kinds of magazines, with a total annual circulation of more than 500 million copies; more than 42,000 kinds of books were published, with a total circulation of more than 2 billion copies; the number of higher art colleges increased to 34; state-run libraries, museums, cultural centers, etc., have all greatly increased compared with 1957. At the same time, the quality of various cultural and artistic undertakings has generally improved. Significant achievements have also been made in technical innovation and technical revolution.

The cultural and artistic undertakings in minority areas of our country have been newly developed. Four autonomous regions, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia, have established film studios. More than a dozen ethnic publishing houses have been established, and the number of books published in various ethnic minority languages has greatly increased. The creation movement of poetry, music, and dance of ethnic minorities is flourishing, and several ethnic minorities who have never had their own drama have also established their own ethnic drama for the first time. The unearthed and sorted out folk literature works of ethnic minorities are becoming increasingly rich. In the past two years, no less than one hundred folk tales and narrative poems (including long poems of "epic" nature) of ethnic minorities have been sorted out and published. The "Gesar" translated into Chinese and published last year is a great epic shared by the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. Among the books dedicated to the National Day last year, there were also newly compiled literary histories of several ethnic minorities. This is an unprecedented event. These literary histories laid the foundation for more complete literary histories of all ethnic groups in the future.

With the rapid development of cultural and artistic undertakings, the cultural and artistic ranks have been further improved and expanded. On the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, cultural and artistic workers enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, went to the countryside and factories to participate in labor training, and integrated with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their ideological awareness has greatly improved. New forces are emerging everywhere; they are active in creation, performance, and academic research. The "History of Chinese Literature" compiled by the students of the 1955 class of the Chinese Department of Peking University using the basic viewpoints of Marxism, and the rapid growth of a large number of young artistic talents are obvious examples. Our cultural and artistic ranks are rapidly growing.

The achievements made in cultural and artistic work in the past two years are enormous. This is the result of the cultural and artistic departments at all levels and the cultural and artistic workers of all ethnic groups in the country implementing the Party's General Line and the Party's cultural and artistic work policy, and it is a great victory for the Party's correct leadership and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

New Situation, New Tasks, New Ideas

At present, we are facing an unprecedentedly good situation. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and after the rectification movement of anti-rightism and the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, the people of the whole country are more high-spirited and vigorous, and have set off a upsurge in the continued great leap forward of socialist construction. With the rapid advancement of industrial and agricultural production, the mass movement of technical revolution and cultural revolution has been launched vigorously, and the broad masses of people have become more enthusiastic about cultural and artistic work. In order to adapt to this new situation, our cultural and artistic work in 1960 should be guided by the Party's General Line and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the guidance of the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, and "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," "bringing forth the new from the old," implement the working policy of "overall planning, active development, key construction, and improving quality," so as to better realize the continued leap forward in cultural and artistic work and serve socialist construction more effectively.

Continuing to deeply carry out the movement of anti-rightism and boost morale, and conducting education on socialism and communism in the cultural and artistic ranks is the primary condition for realizing the continued leap forward in cultural and artistic work. Cultural and artistic departments and cultural and artistic workers in various places must thoroughly overcome all right-leaning conservative ideas, and firmly implement the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The view that cultural and artistic work cannot implement the Party's General Line, or that the "more, faster" and "better, more economical" are separated and opposed to each other, is extremely wrong. We must thoroughly reverse right-leaning ideas and right-leaning emotions, boost greater morale, fully develop the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and set off a mass movement of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" to build and develop socialist cultural and artistic undertakings in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

In the field of culture and art, we must continue to wage a struggle against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionist literary and artistic thought. Since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party, a series of victories have been achieved on the cultural and artistic front in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. Time and again, bourgeois ideology has been severely hit, ensuring the implementation of the Party's cultural and artistic policy and enabling socialist culture and art to develop vigorously. Through these ideological struggles, cultural and artistic workers have received profound education and their ideological awareness has been continuously improved. At present, the leading position of Marxism-Leninism has been basically established on the cultural and artistic front. But we must see that the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term and repeated. Therefore, we must be vigilant and continue to launch a struggle against bourgeois ideology and revisionist literary and artistic thought. As everyone knows, modern revisionist thought is the main danger in the current international workers' movement, and revisionist literary and artistic thought is the manifestation of revisionist political thought in the field of culture and art. Revisionists talk volubly about the bourgeoisie's hypocritical "humanitarianism," "love of humanity," and "human nature theory" to oppose class struggle and the party spirit of the proletariat; under the guise of "writing the truth," they are essentially advocating writing exclusively about the "dark side" of social life in order to attack the socialist system and provoke people's dissatisfaction with the new society by obliterating the fact that the bright side of socialist social life is the mainstream; they advocate the bourgeoisie's long-bankrupt clichés of "freedom of creation" and "freedom of literature and art" to oppose the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work and the guiding role of the revolutionary worldview for literary and artistic creation, etc.; all these extremely absurd claims, although sometimes disguised, sometimes hesitant, are essentially to abolish proletarian literature and art and restore bourgeois literature and art; they are to make culture and art deviate from the leadership of the proletarian political party and serve the bourgeoisie. We must resolutely oppose this revisionist literary and artistic thought, thoroughly expose and criticize its anti-socialist reactionary essence, and raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher to clear the way for the further development of socialist culture and art.

In order to better realize culture and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism, we must adhere to and implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The great prosperity and great innovation of literary and artistic creation since the Great Leap Forward is the result of mass practice under the guidance of this policy in recent years. We implement this policy in order to better consolidate and develop Marxist ideology and develop and prosper socialist culture and art. We must adhere to the principle of combining the unity of political ideology with the diversity of artistic style, theme, and form. On the one hand, we must use the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the criterion for distinguishing right from wrong, and resolutely struggle against tendencies that violate these six political criteria. On the other hand, we must fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cultural and artistic workers, encourage free debate on various academic views, and advocate free competition of various literary and artistic styles. For our country's excellent national cultural heritage, we must inherit it analytically and differentially, and should strive to bring forth the new from the old, break through old traditions, and create new traditions. For the excellent and progressive culture of foreign countries, we should continue to earnestly and critically absorb it, and should creatively melt it to make it a fresh flower of nationalization and massification. We must adopt a critical attitude towards the literature and art of the past era and break the superstition of the bourgeois literary and artistic heritage. Literary and artistic creation should strive to reflect modern life and struggle, and create new images of heroic figures, which is important for educating the people, but at the same time we cannot ignore historical themes and traditional dramas, and should not put them in opposition to the former. We must develop socialist culture and art according to the diverse needs of the people.

To rapidly develop socialist culture and art, we must implement the mass line and launch mass movements on a large scale. The facts since the Great Leap Forward fully prove that implementing the mass line and launching mass movements on a large scale have not only made culture and art develop by leaps and bounds, but also significantly improved the quality. Adhering to the mass line in cultural and artistic work means that, on the one hand, we must be good at combining with the production and various movements of the masses to vigorously carry out amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers and peasants; on the other hand, we must give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of professional cultural and artistic workers, and make them face the masses and closely integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can we fully develop the wisdom and creativity of the broad masses and the expertise of professional cultural and artistic workers, and rapidly develop and prosper socialist culture and art.

To implement the mass line and build socialist culture, we must pay attention to the correct combination of popularization and improvement, and professionalism and amateurism. They are mutually distinct and mutually related. Ignoring any aspect or separating the two is not conducive to the development of socialist culture and art. To realize the further popularization and improvement of cultural and artistic work in the future, we must vigorously carry out mass cultural work on the one hand, and strengthen key construction and improve the quality of cultural and artistic work on the other hand.

Vigorously developing mass cultural work, especially rural cultural work, is an important task of current cultural work. For this reason, this year we should shoot some films that are more suitable for screening in rural areas and are loved by farmers in terms of content and form, and develop rural film projection teams in larger quantities. In order to meet the needs of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, we must put scientific education film work in a very important position. We must accelerate the development of scientific education film undertakings, and produce more and better scientific education films, so that it can become a powerful tool for promoting new scientific and technological achievements, popularizing scientific and technological knowledge, and carrying out cultural education to the broad masses in urban and rural areas. Publishing houses in various places should strengthen the consolidation of literacy reading materials and popular political, scientific, technological, and literary materials. All kinds of art performance groups should adhere to performing in the countryside, and at the same time provide guidance to rural amateur art activities. Cultural centers, mass art centers, libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions should all take the development of rural mass cultural work as their important task.

We must continue to actively encourage and mobilize the masses to engage in amateur literary and artistic creation, and help mass authors improve their ideological level and writing ability. Various mass amateur cultural and artistic organizations can decide their organizational forms and activities according to local conditions, but they must abide by the principle of amateurism and voluntariness, and prevent developing towards professionalization and extravagant waste.

Improving the quality of cultural and artistic work is a long-term and arduous task. At present, film creation should expand the scope of themes and further improve the ideological, artistic, and technical levels on the existing basis. All kinds of art performance groups should strive to improve their performance level. We must strengthen the leadership of repertoire work, and strive to create modern repertoires according to various situations, and at the same time continue to excavate and sort out traditional repertoires. For the performance of traditional repertoires, we should select them and strive to innovate them.

We must continue to vigorously improve the quality of publications. Academic works must ensure political command and ensure a certain scientific level. We must systematically, selectively, and critically sort out and publish our country's classical works and translate and publish foreign classical works, and vigorously overcome the blindness in this work. We must strengthen the leadership of key units in various cultural and artistic undertakings, and promote them to have greater innovations in all aspects, and quickly improve the quality of work, so as to drive the improvement of the quality of general cultural and artistic work.

Strengthening the training and improvement of cultural and artistic cadres is an urgent task in current cultural work. To train cultural and artistic cadres, we should adopt the policy of walking on two legs, combining long-term training and short-term training, and combining full-time schools and amateur education. On the one hand, we must strengthen and appropriately develop various cultural and artistic professional schools, vigorously improve the quality of teaching and the level of scientific research, and more effectively train cultural and artistic cadres with communist awareness and a higher level of cultural knowledge. On the other hand, we must adopt methods such as holding various training classes and refresher classes in art colleges, professional groups running training classes, apprenticeships by masters, and holding correspondence courses and night schools to vigorously improve the existing cultural and artistic cadres and train a large number of talents in cultural and artistic aspects. We must greatly strengthen the training and improvement of cadres in service. First of all, we should emphasize the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, adhere to the system of going to the countryside and factories to carry out labor training; at the same time, vigorously improve their artistic accomplishment and work level.

In order to successfully achieve the above tasks, all cultural and artistic workers must greatly strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism, and led the Chinese people to achieve great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In literature and art, Chairman Mao also developed Marxist literary and artistic theory, pointed out the correct direction for socialist culture and art, and opened up an infinitely broad path for development. The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers proposed by Chairman Mao has been fully proved its correctness and powerful vitality in long-term practice. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," "bringing forth the new from the old," and the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism not only fully conforms to the objective laws of the development of socialist culture and art in our country, but also is the scientific development of Marxist cultural and artistic theory under new historical conditions. We deeply realize that implementing the Party's and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, and raising the red flag of Mao Zedong Literary Thought even higher, is the most fundamental guarantee for promoting the continuous leap forward of cultural and artistic work and moving from victory to greater victory.

Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for defeating all bourgeois ideology. The series of victories we have achieved on the cultural and artistic front in the past ten years in the struggle against bourgeois ideology is the result of developing the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Cultural and artistic work is ideological work. For cultural and artistic workers, mastering and using the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought is of particular importance. Therefore, our cultural and artistic workers must earnestly, persistently, and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform our world outlook. Transforming the world outlook of cultural and artistic workers and establishing the proletarian world outlook is the key issue in implementing the Party's cultural and artistic policies and lines. Only by standing on the position of the proletariat to observe and consider problems, and always being promoters of the revolution and loyal children of the working people, can cultural and artistic workers make contributions in building and creating socialist culture and art, otherwise they will inevitably make mistakes, and even be captured by bourgeois ideology and embark on the dangerous road of anti-people and anti-socialism.

Fellow representatives! Our socialist cause is leaping forward at an incredible speed under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The people of the whole country have made up their minds to basically realize the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, and science and culture in the next ten years, and build our country into a powerful socialist country. Facing such a great era, we cultural and artistic workers feel infinite happiness and pride, and are full of confidence in victory. Let us more firmly and more comprehensively implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, establish lofty ambitions, and strive to achieve a better and greater leap forward in cultural and artistic work and to climb the peak of world culture and art!

专栏：

    为实现文化艺术工作的更大更好的跃进而奋斗
    文化部部长沈雁冰的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理的两个报告。这两个报告是严密的科学分析和远大理想的结合，是全盘规划和重点安排的结合，它保证了总路线的坚决贯彻，也就保证了我国工农业生产的继续跃进！
    六十年代的第一个春天，在我国社会主义建设的园地里，真是景色灿烂，气象万千，呈现一片兴旺发达的景象。我们文化战线的各个方面，正在两年来胜利跃进的基础上，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，密锣紧鼓，加速步伐，为迎接这一新的年代的开始，为更好地发展和创造社会主义的文化艺术而奋勇前进。
    大普及，大提高，大繁荣
    自1958年以来，我国文化艺术工作，在毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，出现了大普及、大提高、大繁荣的局面。它标志着我国文化艺术正在经历一个极为深刻的社会主义的变革：一方面广大劳动人民开始掌握了文化，积极地参与了文化艺术的创造和建设；另一方面文化艺术工作者开始在全体规模上实行劳动化，密切地同工农兵群众相结合，从而极大地促进了社会主义文化艺术事业的发展和繁荣。
    两年来，工农群众的文化艺术活动空前高涨。千百万劳动人民热烈地参加了各种文化艺术活动，并且运用文化艺术表现自己的冲天干劲和劳动热情，充满了建设社会主义、共产主义的坚强信心。他们创作的许多新民歌，格调清新，气势磅礴，可以毫无愧色地称为社会主义时代的新国风。专业文艺工作者和工农群众、干部结合起来编写的许多革命回忆录、工厂史、部队史、人民公社史，是激动人心的新颖生动、富有艺术性的传记文学，对广大群众起了很大的教育作用。
    专业文艺工作者由于深入工农兵，参加劳动和普及文化工作，思想觉悟大大提高，并且获得了丰富的创作源泉。因此，文学艺术创作不仅数量上大大增加，思想性和艺术性也有显著的提高。近几年来出版的长篇小说如“红旗谱”、“青春之歌”、“林海雪原”、“百炼成钢”、“山乡巨变”、“创业史”、“苦菜花”、“烈火金钢”、“三家巷”、“乘风破浪”、“草原烽火”等，都是比较成功的作品。长篇叙事诗的丰产，成为诗歌创作中一个特点。“杨高传”和“动荡的年代”（“复仇的火焰”第一部）等等长篇叙事诗以及其他抒情诗、政治诗的多种多样的风格，都标志着诗人们由于学习新民歌和吸收古典诗歌的优良传统，在创造新诗风的道路上迈进了一大步。近两年出产的电影故事片如“林则徐”、“青春之歌”、“风暴”、“万水千山”、“金玉姬”、“五朵金花”、“万紫千红总是春”等，新闻纪录片“英雄战胜北大荒”、“百万农奴站起来”等，科教片“中国猿人”、“改造自然”，美术片“一幅僮锦”、“美丽的小金鱼”等，都受到广大观众的好评。话剧在表现劳动人民革命斗争和现代生活方面，既能刚健地反映伟大时代的脉搏，又在民族风格的创造上获得新的成就，话剧的表演水平也有很大的提高。今年2月在部分省市话剧观摩会演中演出的“降龙伏虎”、“红旗谱”、“东进序曲”、“槐树庄”、“枯木逢春”等，在民族化、群众化的共同基础上都有各自的风格。新歌剧“柯山红日”、“洪湖赤卫队”、“春雷”、“两代人”等，标志着“白毛女”的优秀传统正在获得进一步的发展。音乐方面的“社会主义好”、“梁山伯与祝英台小提琴协奏曲”、“嘎达梅林”（交响诗）、“幸福河大合唱”，舞剧“不朽的战士”、“宝莲灯”、“五朵红云”、“鱼美人”等，舞蹈“快乐的罗苏”、“丰收乐”、“花伞舞”等，都是比较成功的作品。在绘画、雕塑、曲艺、皮影、木偶、杂技等方面，也出现许多新的艺术花朵。我国传统的戏曲艺术有了新的发展，不但演出了许多优秀的经过革新的传统剧目，还演出了不少现代题材的剧目；一些比较古老的剧种，也尝试演出了现代题材的剧目，并且获得了初步的成功。总而言之，两年来的文艺创作，在实践民族化、群众化上面，显示了可贵的独创精神，并且取得了显著的成绩。
    两年来，各种文化艺术事业有很大的发展。到1959年底，全国电影放映单位已达到一万四千五百个，比1949年增加了二十二倍；剧团增加到三千五百个，剧场增加到二千五百个；1959年全国专区级以上的报纸有四百五十六种，全年总印数四十八亿多份；杂志有八百五十九种，全年总印数五亿多册；出版图书四万二千多种，总印数二十亿多册；高等艺术院校增加到三十四所；国家举办的图书馆、博物馆、文化馆等，都比1957年有很大的增长。与此同时，各种文化艺术事业的质量普遍有了提高。在技术革新、技术革命方面，也获得了显著的成绩。
    我国少数民族地区的文化艺术事业有了新的发展。内蒙古、新疆、广西和宁夏四个自治区都建立了电影制片厂。民族出版社已建立了十几个，用各种少数民族文字出版的图书数量大大增加。少数民族的诗歌、音乐、舞蹈创作运动蓬勃发展，若干从来没有自己的戏剧的少数民族，也第一次建立了自己民族的戏剧。发掘和整理出来的少数民族的民间文学作品，日益丰富。两年来经过整理出版的少数民族的民间故事和叙事长诗（包括“史诗”性质的长诗），不下百部之多。去年被翻译为汉文发表的“格萨尔王传”，就是一部蒙藏两个民族所共有的伟大史诗。去年国庆献礼书籍中还有新编的若干少数民族的文学史，这是空前的盛事，这些文学史为将来的更完备的各族文学史奠定了基础。
    随着文化艺术事业的飞跃发展，文化艺术队伍进一步提高和扩大了。在整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，文化艺术工作者热烈地响应党的号召，下乡下厂参加劳动锻炼，同工农群众相结合，思想觉悟有了很大的提高。新生力量到处崭然露头角；创作、表演、学术研究，都有他们在活跃。北京大学中文系1955级学生用马克思主义的基本观点编写的“中国文学史”，以及大批年轻的艺术人材的迅速成长，就是明显的例子。我们的文化艺术队伍正在迅速壮大起来。
    两年来文化艺术工作所取得的成绩是巨大的。这是各级文化艺术部门和全国各族文化艺术工作者贯彻执行党的总路线和党的文化艺术工作方针的结果，是党的正确领导和毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利。
    新形势，新任务，新思想
    目前，我们正面临着空前未有的大好形势。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过反右倾、鼓干劲的整风运动和增产节约运动，全国人民更加斗志昂扬、意气风发，掀起了社会主义建设继续大跃进的热潮。随着工农业生产的突飞猛进，技术革命和文化革命的群众运动已经猛烈展开，广大人民群众对文化艺术的要求更加高涨。为了适应这个新形势，我们1960年的文化艺术工作，应该在党的总路线和毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在文化艺术为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“推陈出新”的方针指导下，实行“全面规划、积极发展、重点建设、提高质量”的工作方针，以便更好地实现文化艺术工作的继续跃进，更加有效地为社会主义建设服务。
    在文化艺术队伍中继续深入地开展反右倾、鼓干劲，进行社会主义、共产主义教育的运动，是实现文化艺术工作继续跃进的首要条件。各地文化艺术部门和文化艺术工作者必须彻底克服一切右倾保守思想，坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。那种认为文化艺术工作不能贯彻党的总路线，或者把“多、快”和“好、省”割裂开来和互相对立起来的看法，都是极端错误的。我们必须彻底反掉右倾思想和右倾情绪，鼓足更大干劲，充分发挥敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，并且掀起一个“学、比、赶、帮”的群众运动，来又多、又快、又好、又省地建设和发展社会主义的文化艺术事业。
    在文化艺术领域内，我们必须继续展开同资产阶级思想和现代修正主义文艺思想的斗争。建国以来，在党的领导下，文化艺术战线上取得了一系列的反对资产阶级思想斗争的胜利，一次又一次地给了资产阶级思想以严重的打击，保证了党的文化艺术方针的贯彻执行，使社会主义文化艺术得以蓬勃发展。经过这些思想斗争，文化艺术工作者受到了深刻的教育，思想觉悟不断提高。现在，在文化艺术战线上，马克思列宁主义思想的领导地位基本上已经确立起来。但是我们必须看到，无产阶级同资产阶级之间的思想斗争是长期的，反复进行的，因此，我们必须提高警惕，继续展开同资产阶级思想和修正主义文艺思想的斗争。大家知道，现代修正主义思潮是当前国际工人阶级运动中的主要危险，而修正主义文艺思想是修正主义政治思想在文化艺术领域内的表现。修正主义者夸夸其谈资产阶级的虚伪的“人道主义”、“人类之爱”、“人性论”来反对阶级斗争，反对无产阶级的党性；以“写真实”为幌子，实质上是主张专写社会生活的“阴暗面”，以抹煞社会主义社会生活光明面是主流这一事实，来攻击社会主义制度，挑起人们对新社会的不满；提倡资产阶级的早已破产的滥调“创作自由”、“文艺自由”来反对党对文艺工作的领导和革命世界观对于文艺创作的指导作用等等；所有这些极端荒谬的主张，尽管有时披上伪装，有时吞吞吐吐，实质上都是要取消无产阶级文艺，使资产阶级文艺复辟；都是要文化艺术脱离无产阶级政党的领导，而为资产阶级效劳。我们必须坚决反对这种修正主义文艺思想，彻底揭露和批判它的反社会主义的反动本质，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，为进一步发展社会主义文化艺术扫清道路。
    为了更好地实现文化艺术为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务，我们必须坚持贯彻党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。大跃进以来文学艺术创作的大繁荣、大革新，就是几年来在这个方针指导下的群众实践的结果。我们执行这个方针，是为了更好地巩固和发展马克思主义思想，发展和繁荣社会主义文化艺术。我们必须坚持政治思想上的统一性同艺术风格、题材、形式的多样性相结合的原则，一方面要以毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中所提出的六条政治标准作为辨别是非的准则，坚决同违背这六条政治标准的倾向作斗争；另一方面要充分调动文化艺术工作者的积极性，鼓励各种不同的学术见解进行自由争论，提倡各种文艺样式和风格进行自由竞赛。对于我国优秀的民族文化遗产，我们必须有分析有区别地加以继承，并且应该努力推陈出新，突破旧传统，创造新传统。对于外国的优秀的进步的文化，我们应该继续认真地和有批判地吸收，并且要创造性地融化它，使之成为民族化、群众化的新鲜花朵。我们必须对过去时代的文艺采取批判的态度，破除对资产阶级文艺遗产的迷信。文学艺术创作应该努力反映现代生活和斗争，创造新的英雄人物的形象，这对于教育人民有重要的作用，但同时也不能忽视历史题材和传统剧目，更不应该把它们同前者对立起来。我们必须根据人民群众的多种多样的需要来发展社会主义文化艺术。
    要迅速地发展社会主义文化艺术，必须贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。大跃进以来的事实充分证明，贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，不但使文化艺术出现了飞跃的发展，在质量上也有了显著的提高。坚持文化艺术工作中的群众路线，就是一方面要善于结合群众的生产和各种运动，大力开展工农群众业余的文化艺术活动；另一方面要充分发挥专业文化艺术工作者的积极性和创造性，并且使他们面向群众，密切地同工农兵相结合。只有这样，我们才能充分发挥广大群众的智慧和创造力，和专业文化艺术工作者的专长，迅速地发展和繁荣社会主义文化艺术。
    贯彻群众路线，建设社会主义文化，必须注意普及与提高、专业与业余的正确结合。它们是互相区别而又互相联系的，忽视任何一面或者把两者割裂开来，都不利于社会主义文化艺术的发展。要实现今后文化艺术工作进一步的普及和提高，我们一方面要大力开展群众文化工作，一方面要加强重点建设，提高文化艺术工作的质量。
    大力开展群众文化工作，特别是农村文化工作，是当前文化工作的重要任务。为此，今年应该拍摄一部分在内容和形式上更加适合于在农村放映、为农民所喜爱的影片，并且较大量地发展农村电影放映队。为了适应技术革命和文化革命的需要，必须把科学教育电影工作放在十分重要的地位。要加速地发展科学教育电影事业，摄制更多更好的科学教育影片，使它成为向城乡广大群众推广科学技术新成就、普及科学技术知识和进行文化教育的强有力的工具。各地出版社要加强巩固扫盲读物和通俗的政治、科学、技术、文艺等读物的出版工作。各类艺术表演团体要坚持下乡演出，同时对农村业余艺术活动进行辅导。文化馆、群众艺术馆、图书馆、博物馆等文化事业单位，都应该以开展农村群众文化工作作为自己的重要任务。
    要继续积极鼓励和发动群众业余文艺创作，帮助群众作者提高他们的思想水平和写作能力。各种群众业余文化艺术组织，可以因地制宜地决定他们的组织形式和活动方式，但必须遵守业余自愿的原则，防止向专业化发展和发生铺张浪费现象。
    提高文化艺术工作的质量，是一个长期的艰巨的任务。目前，电影创作应该扩大题材范围，并在现有基础上进一步提高思想性和艺术、技术水平。各类艺术表演团体应该努力提高演出水平。要加强对剧目工作的领导，根据各种不同的情况努力创造现代剧目，同时继续发掘和整理传统剧目。对于传统剧目的上演，应该加以选择，并且要努力加以革新。
    要继续大力提高出版物的质量，学术著作既要保证政治挂帅，又要保证一定的科学水平，要有计划、有选择、有批判地整理和出版我国古典著作和翻译出版外国古典著作，大力克服这一工作中的盲目性。必须加强对各种文化艺术事业中重点单位的领导，促使它们在各方面有更大的革新，迅速地提高工作质量，以带动全般文化艺术工作质量的提高。
    加强文化艺术干部的培养和提高工作，是当前文化工作中的迫切任务。培养文化艺术干部，应该采取两条腿走路的方针，使长期培养和短期训练相结合、全日制学校和业余教育相结合。一方面要加强和适当发展各种文化艺术专业学校，大力提高教学质量和科学研究水平，更加有效地培养具有共产主义觉悟的、有较高文化知识水平的文化艺术干部。另一方面要采取在艺术院校内举办各种训练班、进修班，专业团体办学员班、师傅带徒弟和举办函授、夜校等方法，大力提高现有的文化艺术干部和培养大量的文化艺术方面的人材。我们要大大加强在职干部的培养和提高的工作。首先应该强调对马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作的学习，坚持下乡下厂实行劳动锻炼的制度；同时大力提高他们的文艺修养和工作水平。
    为了胜利地实现上述任务，全体文化艺术工作者必须大大加强对毛泽东思想的学习。毛主席创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义，领导中国人民取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。在文学艺术方面，毛主席也发挥了马克思主义的文艺理论，为社会主义文化艺术指出了正确的方向，开辟了无限广阔的发展道路。毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，在长期的实践中完全证明了它的正确性和强大的生命力。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“推陈出新”方针和革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，不仅完全符合我国社会主义文化艺术发展的客观规律，而且是马克思主义文化艺术理论在新的历史条件下的科学的发展。我们深深地体会到，贯彻执行党和毛主席的文艺方针，更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，是促使文化艺术工作持续跃进、从胜利走向更大的胜利的最根本的保证。
    毛泽东思想是战胜一切资产阶级思想的最犀利的武器。十年来我们在文化艺术战线上所取得的一系列的反对资产阶级思想斗争的胜利，就是发挥了毛泽东思想的巨大威力的结果。文化艺术工作是思想工作，对于文化艺术工作者来说，掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个强大武器，具有特别重要的意义。因此，我们文化艺术工作者必须认真地持久地反复地学习毛主席的著作，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，彻底改造我们的世界观。改造文化艺术工作者的世界观，确立无产阶级的世界观，是贯彻执行党的文化艺术方针路线的关键问题。文化艺术工作者只有站在无产阶级的立场来观察问题、考虑问题，永远当革命的促进派和劳动人民的忠实儿女，才能在建设和创造社会主义文化艺术中作出贡献，否则必然会犯错误，甚至会被资产阶级思想俘虏，走上反人民、反社会主义的危险道路。
    各位代表！我们的社会主义事业在党和毛主席的领导下，正在一日千里地飞跃前进。全国人民已经立下雄心壮志，要在今后十年内基本上实现我国工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，把我国建设成一个强大的社会主义国家。面临着这样伟大的时代，我们文化艺术工作者感到无限的幸福和骄傲，并且充满了胜利的信心。让我们更加坚决和更加全面地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，树雄心，立大志，为实现文化艺术工作的更好更大的跃进，为攀登世界文化艺术的高峰而奋斗吧！
