Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. These two reports are a combination of rigorous scientific analysis and far-reaching ideals, a combination of overall planning and key arrangements. It guarantees the resolute implementation of the General Line, and thus guarantees the continued leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production!

In the first spring of the 1960s, the garden of socialist construction in our country is truly magnificent, with a myriad of sights and a thriving scene. All aspects of our cultural front are raising the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher on the basis of the victorious leap forward of the past two years, accelerating our pace to welcome the beginning of this new era and to strive forward to better develop and create socialist culture and art.

Great Popularization, Great Improvement, Great Prosperity

Since 1958, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's cultural and artistic work has seen a situation of great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity. This marks that China's culture and art is undergoing an extremely profound socialist transformation: on the one hand, the broad masses of working people have begun to master culture and actively participate in the creation and construction of culture and art; on the other hand, cultural and artistic workers have begun to implement laborization on a full scale, closely integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thereby greatly promoting the development and prosperity of socialist cultural and artistic undertakings.

In the past two years, the cultural and artistic activities of workers and peasants have surged to unprecedented heights. Millions of working people have enthusiastically participated in various cultural and artistic activities, and used culture and art to express their soaring enthusiasm and labor passion, filled with firm confidence in building socialism and communism. Many new folk songs they created, with their fresh style and magnificent momentum, can be called the new "Guofeng" of the socialist era without any shame. Many revolutionary memoirs, factory histories, military histories, and people's commune histories compiled by professional literary and artistic workers in conjunction with workers, peasants, and cadres are inspiring, novel, vivid, and artistic biographies that have played a great educational role for the broad masses.

Professional literary and artistic workers, due to going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, participating in labor and popularizing cultural work, have greatly improved their ideological awareness and obtained rich creative sources. Therefore, not only has the quantity of literary and artistic creation greatly increased, but the ideological and artistic qualities have also significantly improved. In recent years, long novels such as "Hong Qi Pu" ("Red Flag Genealogy"), "Qingchun Zhi Ge" ("Song of Youth"), "Linhai Xueyuan" ("Tracks in the Snowy Forest"), "Bailian Cheng Gang" ("Steel is Tempered"), "Shanxiang Jubian" ("Changes in a Mountain Village"), "Chuangye Shi" ("History of Entrepreneurship"), "Kucaicaihua" ("Bitter Herbs"), "Liehuo Jingang" ("Diamond Cutters"), "Sanjia Xiang" ("Three Families Lane"), "Chengfeng Polang" ("Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves"), and "Caoyuan Fenghuo" ("Beacon Fire on the Grassland") are all relatively successful works. The abundant production of long narrative poems has become a characteristic of poetry creation. The long narrative poems "Yang Gao Zhuan" ("The Biography of Yang Gao") and "Dongdang De Niandai" ("The Turbulent Years") (Part 1 of "Fuchou De Huoyan" - "Flames of Revenge") and other lyric and political poems with diverse styles all mark that poets have taken a major step forward in creating new poetic styles by learning from new folk songs and absorbing the excellent traditions of classical poetry. Feature films produced in the past two years such as "Lin Zexu," "Qingchun Zhi Ge" ("Song of Youth"), "Fengbao" ("The Storm"), "Wanshui Qianshan" ("Across Mountains and Rivers"), "Jin Yuji," "Wuduo Jinhua" ("Five Golden Flowers"), "Wanzih Qianhong Zongshi Chun" ("A Riot of Color is Always Spring"), news documentaries "Yingxiong Zhansheng Beidahuang" ("Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness"), "Baiwan Nongnu Zhan Qilai" ("A Million Serfs Stand Up"), science and education films "Zhongguo Yuanren" ("Peking Man"), "Gaizao Ziran" ("Transforming Nature"), animated films "Yifu Tongjin" ("A Brocade of the Zhuang People"), "Meili De Xiao Jinyu" ("The Beautiful Little Goldfish") have all been well received by the broad audience. In representing the revolutionary struggles and modern life of the working people, drama not only vividly reflects the pulse of the great era, but also achieves new achievements in the creation of national style, and the performance level of drama has also greatly improved. "Jiang Long Fu Hu" ("Taming Dragons and Subduing Tigers"), "Hong Qi Pu" ("Red Flag Genealogy"), "Dongjin Xuqu" ("Overture to the Eastern Advance"), "Huaishu Zhuang" ("Locust Tree Village"), "Kumu Fengchun" ("Withered Trees Meet Spring") and other dramas performed in the February drama festival in some provinces and cities all have their own styles on the common basis of nationalization and popularization. New operas such as "Keshan Hongri" ("Red Sun on Keshan Mountain"), "Honghu Chiweidui" ("Red Guards of Honghu Lake"), "Chunlei" ("Spring Thunder"), and "Liang Dai Ren" ("Two Generations") mark that the excellent tradition of "Baimao NÃ¼" ("The White Haired Girl") is being further developed. Music such as "Shehuizhuyi Hao" ("Socialism is Good"), "Liang Shanbo yu Zhu Yingtai Violin Concerto" ("Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto"), "Gada Meilin" (symphonic poem), "Xingfu He Da Hechang" ("Happiness River Chorus"), dance dramas "Buxiu De Zhanshi" ("Immortal Warriors"), "Baolian Deng" ("Lotus Lantern"), "Wuduo Hongyun" ("Five Red Clouds"), "Yumeiren" ("The Mermaid"), dances "Kuaile De Luosu" ("Happy Luosu"), "Fengshou Le" ("Harvest Joy"), "Huasan Wu" ("Umbrella Dance") are all relatively successful works. Many new artistic flowers have also appeared in painting, sculpture, folk art, shadow puppetry, marionettes, acrobatics and other aspects. China's traditional opera art has been newly developed, not only performing many excellent traditional plays that have been reformed, but also performing many modern-themed plays; some older operas have also tried to perform modern-themed plays and achieved initial success. In short, the literary and artistic creation of the past two years has shown valuable originality in the practice of nationalization and popularization, and has achieved remarkable results.

In the past two years, various cultural and artistic undertakings have greatly developed. By the end of 1959, the number of film screening units in the country had reached 14,500, an increase of 22 times compared with 1949; the number of troupes had increased to 3,500, and the number of theaters had increased to 2,500; in 1959, there were 456 kinds of newspapers above the prefecture level in the country, with a total annual circulation of more than 4.8 billion copies; there were 859 kinds of magazines, with a total annual circulation of more than 500 million copies; more than 42,000 kinds of books were published, with a total circulation of more than 2 billion copies; the number of higher art colleges increased to 34; state-run libraries, museums, cultural centers, etc., have all greatly increased compared with 1957. At the same time, the quality of various cultural and artistic undertakings has generally improved. Significant achievements have also been made in technical innovation and technical revolution.

The cultural and artistic undertakings in minority areas of our country have been newly developed. Four autonomous regions, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia, have established film studios. More than a dozen ethnic publishing houses have been established, and the number of books published in various ethnic minority languages has greatly increased. The creation movement of poetry, music, and dance of ethnic minorities is flourishing, and several ethnic minorities who have never had their own drama have also established their own ethnic drama for the first time. The unearthed and sorted out folk literature works of ethnic minorities are becoming increasingly rich. In the past two years, no less than one hundred folk tales and narrative poems (including long poems of "epic" nature) of ethnic minorities have been sorted out and published. The "Gesar" translated into Chinese and published last year is a great epic shared by the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. Among the books dedicated to the National Day last year, there were also newly compiled literary histories of several ethnic minorities. This is an unprecedented event. These literary histories laid the foundation for more complete literary histories of all ethnic groups in the future.

With the rapid development of cultural and artistic undertakings, the cultural and artistic ranks have been further improved and expanded. On the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, cultural and artistic workers enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, went to the countryside and factories to participate in labor training, and integrated with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their ideological awareness has greatly improved. New forces are emerging everywhere; they are active in creation, performance, and academic research. The "History of Chinese Literature" compiled by the students of the 1955 class of the Chinese Department of Peking University using the basic viewpoints of Marxism, and the rapid growth of a large number of young artistic talents are obvious examples. Our cultural and artistic ranks are rapidly growing.

The achievements made in cultural and artistic work in the past two years are enormous. This is the result of the cultural and artistic departments at all levels and the cultural and artistic workers of all ethnic groups in the country implementing the Party's General Line and the Party's cultural and artistic work policy, and it is a great victory for the Party's correct leadership and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

New Situation, New Tasks, New Ideas

At present, we are facing an unprecedentedly good situation. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and after the rectification movement of anti-rightism and the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, the people of the whole country are more high-spirited and vigorous, and have set off a upsurge in the continued great leap forward of socialist construction. With the rapid advancement of industrial and agricultural production, the mass movement of technical revolution and cultural revolution has been launched vigorously, and the broad masses of people have become more enthusiastic about cultural and artistic work. In order to adapt to this new situation, our cultural and artistic work in 1960 should be guided by the Party's General Line and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the guidance of the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, and "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," "bringing forth the new from the old," implement the working policy of "overall planning, active development, key construction, and improving quality," so as to better realize the continued leap forward in cultural and artistic work and serve socialist construction more effectively.

Continuing to deeply carry out the movement of anti-rightism and boost morale, and conducting education on socialism and communism in the cultural and artistic ranks is the primary condition for realizing the continued leap forward in cultural and artistic work. Cultural and artistic departments and cultural and artistic workers in various places must thoroughly overcome all right-leaning conservative ideas, and firmly implement the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The view that cultural and artistic work cannot implement the Party's General Line, or that the "more, faster" and "better, more economical" are separated and opposed to each other, is extremely wrong. We must thoroughly reverse right-leaning ideas and right-leaning emotions, boost greater morale, fully develop the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and set off a mass movement of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" to build and develop socialist cultural and artistic undertakings in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

In the field of culture and art, we must continue to wage a struggle against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionist literary and artistic thought. Since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party, a series of victories have been achieved on the cultural and artistic front in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. Time and again, bourgeois ideology has been severely hit, ensuring the implementation of the Party's cultural and artistic policy and enabling socialist culture and art to develop vigorously. Through these ideological struggles, cultural and artistic workers have received profound education and their ideological awareness has been continuously improved. At present, the leading position of Marxism-Leninism has been basically established on the cultural and artistic front. But we must see that the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term and repeated. Therefore, we must be vigilant and continue to launch a struggle against bourgeois ideology and revisionist literary and artistic thought. As everyone knows, modern revisionist thought is the main danger in the current international workers' movement, and revisionist literary and artistic thought is the manifestation of revisionist political thought in the field of culture and art. Revisionists talk volubly about the bourgeoisie's hypocritical "humanitarianism," "love of humanity," and "human nature theory" to oppose class struggle and the party spirit of the proletariat; under the guise of "writing the truth," they are essentially advocating writing exclusively about the "dark side" of social life in order to attack the socialist system and provoke people's dissatisfaction with the new society by obliterating the fact that the bright side of socialist social life is the mainstream; they advocate the bourgeoisie's long-bankrupt clichÃ©s of "freedom of creation" and "freedom of literature and art" to oppose the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work and the guiding role of the revolutionary worldview for literary and artistic creation, etc.; all these extremely absurd claims, although sometimes disguised, sometimes hesitant, are essentially to abolish proletarian literature and art and restore bourgeois literature and art; they are to make culture and art deviate from the leadership of the proletarian political party and serve the bourgeoisie. We must resolutely oppose this revisionist literary and artistic thought, thoroughly expose and criticize its anti-socialist reactionary essence, and raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher to clear the way for the further development of socialist culture and art.

In order to better realize culture and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism, we must adhere to and implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The great prosperity and great innovation of literary and artistic creation since the Great Leap Forward is the result of mass practice under the guidance of this policy in recent years. We implement this policy in order to better consolidate and develop Marxist ideology and develop and prosper socialist culture and art. We must adhere to the principle of combining the unity of political ideology with the diversity of artistic style, theme, and form. On the one hand, we must use the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the criterion for distinguishing right from wrong, and resolutely struggle against tendencies that violate these six political criteria. On the other hand, we must fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cultural and artistic workers, encourage free debate on various academic views, and advocate free competition of various literary and artistic styles. For our country's excellent national cultural heritage, we must inherit it analytically and differentially, and should strive to bring forth the new from the old, break through old traditions, and create new traditions. For the excellent and progressive culture of foreign countries, we should continue to earnestly and critically absorb it, and should creatively melt it to make it a fresh flower of nationalization and massification. We must adopt a critical attitude towards the literature and art of the past era and break the superstition of the bourgeois literary and artistic heritage. Literary and artistic creation should strive to reflect modern life and struggle, and create new images of heroic figures, which is important for educating the people, but at the same time we cannot ignore historical themes and traditional dramas, and should not put them in opposition to the former. We must develop socialist culture and art according to the diverse needs of the people.

To rapidly develop socialist culture and art, we must implement the mass line and launch mass movements on a large scale. The facts since the Great Leap Forward fully prove that implementing the mass line and launching mass movements on a large scale have not only made culture and art develop by leaps and bounds, but also significantly improved the quality. Adhering to the mass line in cultural and artistic work means that, on the one hand, we must be good at combining with the production and various movements of the masses to vigorously carry out amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers and peasants; on the other hand, we must give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of professional cultural and artistic workers, and make them face the masses and closely integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can we fully develop the wisdom and creativity of the broad masses and the expertise of professional cultural and artistic workers, and rapidly develop and prosper socialist culture and art.

To implement the mass line and build socialist culture, we must pay attention to the correct combination of popularization and improvement, and professionalism and amateurism. They are mutually distinct and mutually related. Ignoring any aspect or separating the two is not conducive to the development of socialist culture and art. To realize the further popularization and improvement of cultural and artistic work in the future, we must vigorously carry out mass cultural work on the one hand, and strengthen key construction and improve the quality of cultural and artistic work on the other hand.

Vigorously developing mass cultural work, especially rural cultural work, is an important task of current cultural work. For this reason, this year we should shoot some films that are more suitable for screening in rural areas and are loved by farmers in terms of content and form, and develop rural film projection teams in larger quantities. In order to meet the needs of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, we must put scientific education film work in a very important position. We must accelerate the development of scientific education film undertakings, and produce more and better scientific education films, so that it can become a powerful tool for promoting new scientific and technological achievements, popularizing scientific and technological knowledge, and carrying out cultural education to the broad masses in urban and rural areas. Publishing houses in various places should strengthen the consolidation of literacy reading materials and popular political, scientific, technological, and literary materials. All kinds of art performance groups should adhere to performing in the countryside, and at the same time provide guidance to rural amateur art activities. Cultural centers, mass art centers, libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions should all take the development of rural mass cultural work as their important task.

We must continue to actively encourage and mobilize the masses to engage in amateur literary and artistic creation, and help mass authors improve their ideological level and writing ability. Various mass amateur cultural and artistic organizations can decide their organizational forms and activities according to local conditions, but they must abide by the principle of amateurism and voluntariness, and prevent developing towards professionalization and extravagant waste.

Improving the quality of cultural and artistic work is a long-term and arduous task. At present, film creation should expand the scope of themes and further improve the ideological, artistic, and technical levels on the existing basis. All kinds of art performance groups should strive to improve their performance level. We must strengthen the leadership of repertoire work, and strive to create modern repertoires according to various situations, and at the same time continue to excavate and sort out traditional repertoires. For the performance of traditional repertoires, we should select them and strive to innovate them.

We must continue to vigorously improve the quality of publications. Academic works must ensure political command and ensure a certain scientific level. We must systematically, selectively, and critically sort out and publish our country's classical works and translate and publish foreign classical works, and vigorously overcome the blindness in this work. We must strengthen the leadership of key units in various cultural and artistic undertakings, and promote them to have greater innovations in all aspects, and quickly improve the quality of work, so as to drive the improvement of the quality of general cultural and artistic work.

Strengthening the training and improvement of cultural and artistic cadres is an urgent task in current cultural work. To train cultural and artistic cadres, we should adopt the policy of walking on two legs, combining long-term training and short-term training, and combining full-time schools and amateur education. On the one hand, we must strengthen and appropriately develop various cultural and artistic professional schools, vigorously improve the quality of teaching and the level of scientific research, and more effectively train cultural and artistic cadres with communist awareness and a higher level of cultural knowledge. On the other hand, we must adopt methods such as holding various training classes and refresher classes in art colleges, professional groups running training classes, apprenticeships by masters, and holding correspondence courses and night schools to vigorously improve the existing cultural and artistic cadres and train a large number of talents in cultural and artistic aspects. We must greatly strengthen the training and improvement of cadres in service. First of all, we should emphasize the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, adhere to the system of going to the countryside and factories to carry out labor training; at the same time, vigorously improve their artistic accomplishment and work level.

In order to successfully achieve the above tasks, all cultural and artistic workers must greatly strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism, and led the Chinese people to achieve great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In literature and art, Chairman Mao also developed Marxist literary and artistic theory, pointed out the correct direction for socialist culture and art, and opened up an infinitely broad path for development. The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers proposed by Chairman Mao has been fully proved its correctness and powerful vitality in long-term practice. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," "bringing forth the new from the old," and the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism not only fully conforms to the objective laws of the development of socialist culture and art in our country, but also is the scientific development of Marxist cultural and artistic theory under new historical conditions. We deeply realize that implementing the Party's and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, and raising the red flag of Mao Zedong Literary Thought even higher, is the most fundamental guarantee for promoting the continuous leap forward of cultural and artistic work and moving from victory to greater victory.

Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for defeating all bourgeois ideology. The series of victories we have achieved on the cultural and artistic front in the past ten years in the struggle against bourgeois ideology is the result of developing the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Cultural and artistic work is ideological work. For cultural and artistic workers, mastering and using the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought is of particular importance. Therefore, our cultural and artistic workers must earnestly, persistently, and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform our world outlook. Transforming the world outlook of cultural and artistic workers and establishing the proletarian world outlook is the key issue in implementing the Party's cultural and artistic policies and lines. Only by standing on the position of the proletariat to observe and consider problems, and always being promoters of the revolution and loyal children of the working people, can cultural and artistic workers make contributions in building and creating socialist culture and art, otherwise they will inevitably make mistakes, and even be captured by bourgeois ideology and embark on the dangerous road of anti-people and anti-socialism.

Fellow representatives! Our socialist cause is leaping forward at an incredible speed under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The people of the whole country have made up their minds to basically realize the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, and science and culture in the next ten years, and build our country into a powerful socialist country. Facing such a great era, we cultural and artistic workers feel infinite happiness and pride, and are full of confidence in victory. Let us more firmly and more comprehensively implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, establish lofty ambitions, and strive to achieve a better and greater leap forward in cultural and artistic work and to climb the peak of world culture and art!
