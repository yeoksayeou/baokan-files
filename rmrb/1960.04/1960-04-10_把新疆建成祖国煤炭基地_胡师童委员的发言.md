Committee Member Hu Shitoong's Speech:

Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and warmly support the work report of the Standing Committee by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, the report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960 by Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council, and the report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget Draft by Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council. I pledge to implement them in my future work and am determined to strive to realize the great calls of Vice Chairman Chen and the two Vice Premiers of the State Council.

I. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report has greatly enlightened and educated us. This report, based on Mao Zedong Thought and the theory of political economy, summarizes the rich experience of the sustained high-speed development of the national economy in the past two years, 1958 and 1959. Practice has proven that the great leap forward in production and construction is the inevitable trend of socialist production development and an objective law. The national economy always experiences a process from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance again. Balance is temporary and relative, while imbalance is absolute and long-lasting. Things always develop forward according to the formula of imbalance-balance-imbalance. Imbalance is the driving force for the development of the national economy. Because of imbalance, there are new things; because of differences, a situation of catching up with each other can emerge. In practice, we are not only not afraid of imbalance, but also dare to create it. For example, when the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward in 1958, we grasped this key production sector, making it leap forward first, thus creating an imbalance. At the same time, we closely followed by grasping electricity, coal, transportation and other sectors, enabling them to continuously catch up with the rapid growth of the steel sector, and thus there was a comprehensive leap forward in all sectors of the national economy.

However, some comrades lack a correct understanding and correct handling methods for the phenomenon of imbalance between departments. When an imbalance occurs, they become flustered and uneasy. They require "stability" in planning and work, wanting the advanced to wait for the backward. They are passive proponents of balance and stumbling blocks to the cause of socialist construction. We not only recognize the inevitability of imbalance in the development of things, but also actively strive to carry out balancing work, grasping weak links and backward departments, and through people's subjective efforts, making the backward catch up with the advanced. After a short period of balance, imbalance reappears. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "The national economy always experiences a process of development from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance, and each repetition raises the level of production by one step, and the national economy continuously moves forward in such a wave-like motion."

Vice Premier Li's discussion of "constantly and reasonably resolving the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, and continuously reforming the relations of production and the superstructure according to the requirements of the rapid development of the productive forces, opens up broad prospects for the continuous development of the productive forces" feels particularly close to us coal workers. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have felt that many old management systems and old production relations have shackled our hands and feet, limiting the development of the productive forces. Because coal mines are underground operations, with multiple processes and types of work, and the workplace is constantly moving, the size of each process, type of work, and workload is often unbalanced in the coal mining process. Drilling blasting holes and cutting coal require fewer people, while shoveling coal after blasting requires more people. When the previous shift is about to end, it is also when the shoveling workload is the largest and the need for people is the greatest. Because the number of people per shift is fixed, some processes feel that there are too many people, while others feel that there are too few, making it impossible to adjust. Workers often work overtime because they cannot complete their tasks, and because of the three-shift, eight-hour work system, workers generally spend more than eight hours from entering the workface to leaving it. Adding in going down and up the mine, walking, picking up and returning lamps, the time is generally more than nine to eleven hours. The workers have worked to the best of their ability, but the coal mining workface and the machinery equipped for it cannot be fully utilized, and the potential cannot be realized, failing to meet the needs of sustained high production. Since the implementation of "four-eight" cross-shift operations, each shift has two hours of cross-shift operation time. The workers of the next shift can help the workers of the previous shift shovel coal, adjusting the labor force and improving the utilization rate of working hours at the workface. In the past, under the three-shift, eight-hour work system, each small shift in the tunneling workface had surplus time to complete one cycle (Note), but not enough time to complete two cycles, resulting in some idle labor for the workers. The implementation of "four-eight" cross-shift operations, with four shifts of work per day, ensures the completion of four cycles, and the progress of the roadway has increased by one-third. After the "four-eight" cross-shift operation was implemented, workers had both work and rest, output increased, and efficiency improved; the number of workers did not increase. This is a vivid example of reforming the production system to promote the development of productive forces.

Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "Socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfections are in contradiction with the development of productive forces." In industrial enterprises, this contradiction is often manifested in the fact that enterprise management work lags behind the development of productive forces. Only by constantly improving production organization and labor organization, reforming those regulations and systems that are no longer applicable, and establishing new regulations and systems, can the relations of production adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces, and can we continue to achieve a sustained great leap forward.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report is equally inspiring. With the leap forward in production, China's financial work has also entered a new situation: more income, more expenditure, more construction; even more income, even more expenditure, even more construction. It is truly a thriving economy, abundant financial resources, stable prices, and increased inventories.

This is the victory of strengthening Party leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and vigorously launching mass movements. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

II. In 1959, under the correct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the People's Committee, and the Ministry of Coal Industry, the coal industry of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region achieved a better and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Raw coal production fulfilled the state plan 23 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 27.4% compared to 1958; the volume of capital construction work completed the annual task 24 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 137% compared to the capital construction investment volume in 1958. Other aspects such as geological exploration, coal mine design, chemical production, machinery repair, and cadre training all comprehensively overfulfilled the annual plan.

Our work achievements in the past year have been enormous. However, achieving these achievements has not been smooth sailing. In the first half of 1959, when production and construction required us to proceed at a higher level and faster speed, while conditions such as materials, equipment, and transportation were quite difficult, some comrades considered the limitations of objective conditions more and considered the subjective dynamic role of people less, thus generating feelings of relaxation, waiting, reliance, and even complaint. Because these comrades left politics and left the masses, the work they led was cold and bleak. After studying the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the enlarged meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, all employees enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously promote the movement to increase production and practice economy. The situation quickly improved, output rose rapidly, and the volume of capital construction work also increased exponentially. The objective material conditions at that time basically did not change much. The above facts show that when we listen to the Party and put politics in command, our cause will be victorious in everything, and any difficulty can be overcome. When we do not listen to the Party and politics are not in command, there will be many difficulties and nothing will be accomplished.

1960 is a year of continued great leap forward following the two consecutive years of great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. Since the first quarter, we have already achieved the victory of a good start, red every month, and all-round red. In terms of coal production, it is expected to overfulfill the first quarter plan by 24.5%; the amount of work completed in capital construction is more than the amount completed in the first half of last year. Employees are all full of energy and enthusiasm. Since February of this year, a magnificent and powerful mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on the great revolution in production organization and the liberation of heavy physical labor has been launched throughout the bureau, and more than 90% of the employees have been involved in the movement. In just over ten days, the units directly under the administration have put forward more than 820,000 technical innovation and rationalization proposals, and more than 1,700 sets of experience have been matched to various tasks and types of work. This mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has played a decisive role in our region's overfulfillment of the first quarter's production and capital construction tasks.

III. Xinjiang has rich coal resources. According to geological prediction data, coal reserves are very abundant. All types of coal are available, and the content of sulfur and ash is low. Many mining areas are endowed with extra-thick coal seams suitable for open-pit mining. It is generally considered to be one of the provinces and regions with the most promising development of open-pit coal mines in the country.

As the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway continues to extend westward and the rapid development of industry and transportation, the demand for coal will inevitably increase by leaps and bounds. In order to ensure the supply of coal, in addition to making every effort to tap the potential of existing enterprises, vigorously engaging in small-scale indigenous groups, vigorously carrying out technical transformation of small coal kilns, we must also accelerate the speed of capital construction and ensure that five pairs of mine shafts are handed over to production on time this year.

In the first spring of the 1960s, our coal industry is showing a thriving and prosperous scene everywhere. We are full of confidence and are determined to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960. Let us hold high the victorious red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, strengthen self-transformation, and strive to rapidly build the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region into an important coal base of the motherland, and strive for continuous leap forward.

(Note) In the process of roadway excavation, completing each process of drilling, loading explosives, blasting, removing gangue, supporting pillars, and laying tracks is called completing one cycle. Because the next process will start from drilling, followed by loading explosives and blasting, etc., the number of meters advanced by the roadway in each cycle is called one cycle progress.

### 把新疆建成祖国煤炭基地  胡师童委员的发言

    把新疆建成祖国煤炭基地
    胡师童委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并热烈拥护政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席的常务委员会工作报告，国务院副总理李富春关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和国务院副总理李先念关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。保证在今后工作中贯彻执行并决心为实现陈副主席和国务院两位副总理的伟大号召而奋斗。
    一、李富春副总理的报告，给了我们很大的启发和教育。这个报告以毛泽东思想和政治经济学的理论，总结了1958年和1959两年来国民经济持续高速度发展的丰富经验。实践证明：生产、建设的大跃进，是社会主义生产发展的必然趋势，是客观的规律。国民经济总是经历不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的过程，平衡是暂时的、相对的，不平衡是绝对的、长久的。事物总是以不平衡——平衡——不平衡的公式向前发展。不平衡是国民经济发展的动力。因为有了不平衡，才有新事物；有了差别，才能出现你追我赶的局面。我们在实践中不仅不怕发生不平衡，而且敢于制造不平衡。例如1958年党中央提出的以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针时，我们抓住了这个关键性的生产部门，使它首先跃进，于是产生了不平衡。同时紧跟着我们就把电力、煤炭、运输等部门抓起来，使它们不断赶上钢铁部门的增长迅速，因而也就出现了国民经济各部门全面的跃进。
    但有些同志对各部门间的不平衡现象缺乏正确的认识和正确的处理方法。当不平衡出现时，他们就手忙脚乱，心神不安。他们要求计划和工作“四平八稳”，要先进的等待落后的，他们是消极的平衡论者，是社会主义建设事业的绊脚石。我们既承认事物发展不平衡的必然性，又积极努力进行平衡工作，抓薄弱环节，抓落后部门，经过人们的主观努力使落后的赶过先进的，经过暂短的平衡又出现不平衡。正像李富春副总理说的：“国民经济总是经历不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的发展过程，而每一次反复，也就把生产水平提高一步，国民经济就在这样的波浪式的运动中不断地向前发展。”
    李副总理关于“不断地合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断地改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路”的论述，对于我们煤炭工作者特别感到亲切。1958年大跃进以来，我们感到许多旧的管理制度和旧的生产关系束缚着我们的手脚，限制了生产力的发展。由于煤矿企业是地下作业，多工序多工种，工作场所不断移动，在采煤过程工作中，各工序、工种与工作量的大小常常是不平衡的，打炮眼，割煤时需要人少，放完炮攉煤时需要人多。当上一班工作快结束的时候，也正是攉煤工作量最大、需人最多的时候。由于一班的人数固定，有的工序觉得人多，又有的工序觉得人少，无法调剂。工人常常因为完不成任务而加班加点，又因限于三班每班八小时作业，工人进入工作面到离开工作面，一般在八小时以上。加上下井和上井、走路、领灯、交灯，时间一般都在九至十一小时以上。工人是尽最大努力工作了，而采煤工作面和为它而装备的机器却得不到充分利用，潜力不能发挥，不能适应持续高产的需要。自从实行了“四八”交叉作业，每班前后都有两小时的交叉作业时间，下一班的工人可以帮助上一班的工人攉煤，调剂了劳动力，提高了工作面的工时利用率。掘进工作面过去三班八小时工作制时，每小班进一个循环（注）时间有富余，进两个循环时间又不够，工人形成部分窝工。实行“四八”交叉作业，每天四班工作，保证走上四个循环，巷道的进度增加了三分之一。“四八”交叉作业推行后，工人有劳有逸，产量上升，效率提高；工人数并不增加。这是改革生产制度以促进生产力的发展的生动例子。
    毛主席英明的指出：“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善方面和生产力的发展，又是相矛盾的。”在工业企业中，这一矛盾往往表现为企业管理工作落后于生产力的发展只有不断地改进生产组织与劳动组织，改革那些已经不适用的规章制度，建立新的规章制度，才能使生产关系适应生产力发展的需要，才能不断地持续大跃进。
    李先念副总理的报告同样是振奋人心的。我国的财政工作随着生产的跃进，也进入了一个新的局面：多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设。真正是经济兴隆，财源茂盛，物价稳定，库存增加。
    这是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    二、1959年新疆维吾尔自治区的煤炭工业，在自治区党委，人委和煤炭工业部的正确领导下，在1958年，大跃进的基础上，实现了更好、更全面的跃进。原煤产量提前二十三天完成了国家计划，比1958年增长了27.4％；基本建设工作量提前二十四天完成全年任务，比1958年基建投资工作量增长了137％。其他方面如地质勘探、煤矿设计，化工生产，机械维修、干部培养，都全面地超额完成了年度计划。
    一年来我们的工作成绩是巨大的。但是取得这些成绩并不是一帆风顺的，1959年上半年当生产、建设要求我们以更高水平更快速度进行，而材料、设备、运输等条件相当困难的时候，某些同志曾更多地考虑了客观条件的限制而少考虑了人的主观能动作用，因而产生了松劲，等待，依赖甚至抱怨情绪。由于这些同志离开了政治、离开了群众，就使他们所领导的那部分工作，冷冷清清，暗然无光。当学习了八届八中全会和自治区党委扩大会议的决议精神以后，全体职工热烈地响应了党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约运动的号召，情势迅速好转，产量迅速上升，基本建设的工作量也成倍地增长。当时的客观物质条件，基本上并无多大变化。上述事实说明了当我们听党的话，政治挂了帅，我们的事业就无往而不胜利，无论什么样的困难，都能克服。当不听党的话，政治不挂帅的时候，就困难重重，一事无成。
    1960年是继1958、1959两年连续大跃进的一年。一季度以来，我们已经取得了开门红，月月红，满堂红的胜利。煤炭生产方面，预计超额24.5％，完成第一季度计划；基本建设完成的工作量比去年上半年完成的还多。职工群众人人精神饱满，个个干劲冲天。今年2月以来，在全局范围内掀起了一个以实行生产组织上的大革命和解放笨重体力劳动为中心的波澜壮阔、声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，90％以上的职工都卷入到运动中去。在短短的十多天中，仅管理局直属单位即提出技术革新与合理化建议八十二万多条，按各项工作、各工种配成套的经验已有一千七百多套。这一技术革新与技术革命的群众性运动，对我区超额完成第一季度生产与基建任务起了决定性作用。
    三、新疆有着丰富的煤炭资源，根据地质。预测资料，煤炭储量很丰富。各种牌号煤都有而且硫分灰分的含量都低。许多矿区赋有特厚煤层适宜于露天开采。一般认为是全国露天煤矿最有发展前途的省、区之一。
    随着兰新干线继续向西延伸，工业、交通运输业的迅速发展，煤炭需要量亦必随之而飞跃增长。为了保证煤炭供应，我们除了千方百计地挖掘现有企业潜力，大搞小土群，大力进行对小煤窑的技术改造，还要加快基本建设的速度，保证今年五对矿井按时移交生产。
    在这六十年代第一个春天，我们煤炭工业到处呈现着一片欣欣向荣蓬勃发展的繁荣景象，我们满怀信心，一定能够实现1960年更大更全面的跃进。让我们高举毛泽东思想的胜利红旗，认真学习毛主席著作，加强自我改造，为把新疆维吾尔自治区迅速地建成为祖国的重要煤炭基地，为不断地跃进而奋斗。
    （注）巷道掘进过程中，完成打眼装药、放炮、出矸、支柱，铺道各工序后，叫做完成一个循环。因为下一道工序又将从打眼开始，接着装药放炮等等，每一个循环巷道进米数叫做一个循环进度。
