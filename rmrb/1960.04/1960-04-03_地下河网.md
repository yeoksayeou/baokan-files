    Underground River Network
    By our reporter Sun Min
    A dense, spiderweb-like underground river network has appeared on the Dongzhi Plateau in eastern Gansu. These river networks mark the path to realizing water conservancy on the plateau, and mark the heroic spirit of people breaking through difficulties and overcoming all obstacles in the struggle to transform nature.
    The underground river network project includes 170,000 water wells and millions of open and covered channels, with a total length of 9,410 kilometers, much longer than the Great Wall. The difficulty of the project is unimaginable. All the wells are dug on the plateau, which is as high as Mount Tai in Shandong. The wells are generally between thirty and fifty meters deep. The river network is entirely excavated in the underground layer, thirty to fifty meters deep. By digging wells and opening channels to gather the water deep underground, accumulating small streams into large ones, and lifting the water to the plateau, the thousand-foot-high arid plateau, which once suffered from "either floods or no water," now sees water flowing everywhere.
    The underground river network is a monument shining with golden light. The monument records the People's Commune's great achievements, and also writes about the disasters, struggles, and joys of the people of Dongzhi Plateau.
          The First Water Well
    The Dongzhi Plateau is the highest and largest loess plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, with an altitude of 1,500 meters. The elevation difference between the plateau and the valley is 250 meters. The total area is more than 2,300 square kilometers. The soil is fertile and has always been known as the "granary." Its richness has attracted the contention of the ruling classes of past dynasties, so trees were cut down, grass was burned, and wars stripped the Dongzhi Plateau of its gorgeous green coat. Natural disasters accompanied human disasters, and every year it was "wind and sand drought in January, February, and March, frost and hail in April, May, and June, torrential rain and rivers in July, August, and September, and a severe lack of rain and snow in October, November, and December—spring drought and autumn flood delayed!" From 1941 to 1948, the Dongzhi Plateau suffered two droughts, two floods, one wind disaster, and one hail disaster. What disaster-ridden years they were!
    The five-star red flag was raised. The battered and bruised Dongzhi Plateau has since been restored to youth, and the people are rebuilding a new and happy home.
    In the spring of 1957, at the meeting of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative to formulate the annual production plan, Communist Party member Li Guangfu proposed to dig wells and draw water to irrigate the land on the Dongzhi Plateau. This bold idea was considered a delusion by many. A well-to-do middle peasant even calculated with his fingers: "My family's water well, from my grandfather to me, has been dug for three generations. The money spent could fill the well, and the water produced is less than the sweat shed." The Party supported the newborn sprout. Four agricultural cooperatives drew twenty young men to work hard for five months, and finally completed a large well with a diameter of 9.3 meters and a depth of 29 meters. The state also provided 900 yuan to buy waterwheels and wood to reinforce the well. The water was lifted to the plateau surface, and the water flowed into the arid loess. The first season of irrigated wheat yielded 370 jin per mu, which was twice as much as dry land. The facts gave the conservatives a strong counterattack. However, while admiring the benefits of irrigated land, everyone was also calculating the cost: digging such an irrigation well would cost more than 1,000 yuan, accounting for more than 40% of an agricultural cooperative's annual public accumulation, and would require more than 1,200 workdays. The conclusion was: although it was good, all cooperatives were unable to promote it.
        Inspiration from Braids
    The establishment of the People's Commune made the Dongzhi Plateau people's desire to dig wells, irrigate the land, and overcome drought a reality. From Xiaojin to Baima, from Donggou to Xigou, tens of thousands of red flags covered the sky in the fields for more than a hundred miles, each flag representing a team of soldiers. Two or three people were responsible for digging one well. Thirty thousand pickaxes and iron shovels directly pierced the heart of the earth, and thirty thousand windlasses turned day and night. The first batch of 30,000 water wells was completed in less than a month. In the midst of victory songs, new difficulties arose: one well could only produce four or five cubic meters of water a day. If the "two immortals conveying the Tao" or "three immortals conveying the Tao" methods were used to draw water for irrigation, these 30,000 wells would require 60,000 to 70,000 waterwheels, 60,000 to 70,000 laborers, and 60,000 to 70,000 large livestock. Bao Haizhen, the First Secretary of the Qingyang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was concerned about this matter day and night. He ate at the construction site, lived at the construction site, and observed everywhere, above and below the wells. Sometimes he talked with the commune members, sometimes he opened maps and materials, and pondered alone. He thought of the tunnel warfare in the North China Plain, and also of the long vines bearing gourds and grape clusters on the Wudong Shanliang Canal. He remembered a leading comrade's saying that people and things should be "braided." Could braiding the water wells also work?
    One day, at the well-digging construction site of the Dongzhi People's Commune, Bao Haizhen said to Qin Lingyi, the secretary of the commune's Party committee: "Lao Qin, what do you think about braiding the water wells? Open covered channels underground, and string together ten, hundreds, or thousands of wells. Let it produce water in the wells and also in the channels, and let the water all converge into the central large well, gathering small water into large water, concentrating into an underground reservoir. Where the terrain is flat, use pumps to lift the water to the plateau; where the slope is large, open channels underground, guiding the water according to the terrain, so that the well water at high places flows out from low places for self-flowing irrigation."
    Qin Lingyi enthusiastically supported this method. The commune members also said in unison: "Good! Others build above-ground rivers, we'll make an underground river network!"
          Facing Difficulties
    Digging large wells of 30 to 50 meters deep was already difficult enough, and now they had to hollow out the stratum and skillfully embroider open and covered channels, which was even more difficult and complex labor. There were no instruments to determine the direction. In the narrow and low covered channels, it was pitch black, and even the most abundant substance in the world—air—was particularly lacking. The excavators of the underground river network had nothing but determination and an iron shovel.
    At the Houguanzhai construction site, there were two capable girls, Jin Meiying and Ding Fengying. The two were responsible for digging a ten-meter-long section of covered channel to connect two wells together. The stubborn girls worked hard day and night, and the channel had already been dug fifteen meters. Listening to the "puff puff" sound of digging in the opposite covered channel, sometimes loud and sometimes soft, sometimes strong and sometimes weak, they still could not get through. The direction was not accurate, and a slight deviation could make a great difference. The two girls unwillingly climbed to the ground. The well-digging captain Li Guangfu and the Communist Youth League branch secretary Bai Jixiong pulled a straight line between the two wellheads with a rope and reinstalled the soil-lifting windlass on this line. Then the two went down to the bottom of the well and dug a small soil trough in the well according to the direction of the windlass above their heads. A flashlight was stuck in the soil trough. When the flashlight was turned on, a beam of white light shone directly opposite, and the light in the well was exactly the same as the direction on the ground. The light could both illuminate and indicate the direction. Digging along the light, it wasn't long before a loud "crash" sounded, and a piece of loess collapsed. The opposite two lights intertwined and shone on four pairs of tightly embracing arms. They had victoriously joined forces.
    Strangely enough, the well had just been hot and stuffy, but in an instant it turned into the coldest winter. It turned out that after the two wells were connected, the covered channel became a wind tunnel, and the temperature changed dramatically. This brought new difficulties to the project. After only one night, the originally loose and soft soil froze as hard as a stone slab. The iron shovel couldn't dig it. The initially opened covered channel could not be excavated, expanded, or repaired for water flow. Ma Jianmin, the captain of the Majiazhuang Production Team of the Dongzhi Commune, came up with the idea of covering the wellhead with wooden boards and grass curtains to block the cold air from the ground from entering the well, and using the underground heat to warm the frozen soil in the covered channel. The next day, Ma Jianmin went down to the bottom of the well again and touched the well wall. It was no longer as cold and prickly. He was overjoyed and raised his iron shovel to dig. Suddenly, with a "crash," a large pile of soil collapsed, and Lao Ma's right leg was also buried in the loess. The well wall was still constantly dropping soil, and there was a danger of being buried alive. Ma Jianmin quickly pulled out his leg and climbed onto the newly collapsed pile of soil. He did not consider his personal safety, but was thinking about why the frozen soil was as soft as tofu after it thawed. He was looking for a way to overcome the immediate difficulties. The situation of pit-wood support in the Ankou Coal Mine appeared in his mind. After climbing out of the well, he led the commune members to find wood and cut tree branches, and built sheds in the well to support and expand the covered channel. When there was not enough wood, he created the method of snake molting, excavating a section, supporting a section, lining a section with bricks and water pipes, and then dismantling the pit-wood to continue moving forward. People were fighting day and night, and the covered channel was being extended step by step.
        New Look of the Plateau
    I once went down to a large well in Houguanzhai, which people called the "Well King." This is a well with a diameter of five meters, and from its foot, four covered channels extend in all directions. The covered channels are excavated like arched small city gates, and the water flows gurgling in the channels. Walking along each covered channel, you will encounter more and more covered channels shaped like leaf veins, and each channel is connected to hundreds of water wells. Walking along the covered channel leading to the west, after passing through a 750-meter-long underground passage, it suddenly opens up, and a line of blue sky appears above the head. On both sides are steep cliffs, more than 20 meters high, split by people's hands. The water channel passes through this narrow gorge, which is only more than one meter wide, for 4,500 meters, and then flows to the ground of the Nanzuo Production Team. I remember that three years ago, when the four agricultural cooperatives of Houguanzhai Township were excavating the first water well, the flood flowed to Nanzuo along the current channel. It washed away Nanzuo's earthen dam and submerged Nanzuo's farmland. Now, the People's Commune has united everyone into a whole with a common destiny. The land in Nanzuo is irrigated with underground water drawn from Houguanzhai. The people of Nanzuo said: "After communization, hearts are linked, lands are connected, floods have become clear water, and water disasters have become water conservancy."
    Today's Dongzhi Plateau, hundreds of thousands of deep wells are all spitting water and offering treasures. Pumps, high-line conveyors, automatic sprinklers, one-dragon artificial rainmakers, and automatic irrigation vehicles, etc., have formed a field army for drought resistance and harvest protection. Thirty-eight hundred thousand mu of winter wheat are fully watered with greening water, and one hundred thousand mu of summer and autumn fields waiting to be sown are also full of soil moisture and fertilizer, waiting for the seeding. In the heart of the plateau, the flow of the underground river network is flowing non-stop. Tens of thousands of pickaxes and iron shovels are continuing to pierce the stratum, and the heroes who are conquering nature are weaving the underground river network denser and longer.

    地下河网
    本报记者　孙民
    在甘肃东部的董志塬上出现了密如蛛网的地下河网。这些河网标志着实现高原水利化的道路，标志着人们在改造自然的斗争中冲破艰险、排除万难的英雄气概。
    地下河网工程，包括十七万眼水井和千百万条明渠暗道，总长度达九千四百一十公里，比万里长城还长得多。工程的艰巨程度是难以想像的。全部水井都打在相等于山东的泰山那样高的原上。井深一般都在三十米至五十米之间。河网又完全开凿在井下三、五十米深的底层里。将深藏在地下的清水，打井开渠，聚小成大，提水上原，使“不是洪水，就是没水”的千尺旱原万水奔流。
    地下河网是一座金光灿烂的纪念碑。碑上记载着人民公社的汗马功劳，也书写着董志塬人民的灾难、战斗和欢乐。
          第一眼水井
    董志塬是黄河中游地势最高，面积最大的一块黄土高原，海拔一千五百米。原谷高差二百五十米。总面积二千三百多平方公里。土壤肥沃，素有“粮仓”之称。它的富饶，引得历代统治阶级的你争我夺，于是树砍了，草烧了，战乱剥走了董志塬华丽的绿衣。天灾伴着人祸而来，年年都是“正二三月风沙干旱，四五六月霜雹接连，七八九月暴雨成河，十冬腊月雨雪奇缺——春旱秋涝两耽搁！”从1941年到1948年，董志塬发生过两次旱灾，两次洪灾，一次风灾，一次雹灾。这是怎样灾难深重的岁月啊！
    五星红旗升起了。遍体鳞伤的董志塬从此恢复了青春，人民在重建新的幸福家园。
    1957年春天，在新民农业社制定全年生产计划的会上，共产党员李广福提出要在董志塬上打井提水浇地。这个大胆的创议，被许多人认为是妄想。一个富裕中农还搬着手指头算账说：“我家一口水井，从我爷到我一直打了三代，花的钱能填满井筒，出的水还没流的汗多。”党支持了新生的幼芽。四个农业社抽出了二十几个小伙子大干了五个月，终于打成了一个直径九米三，二十九米深的大井。国家又援助了九百元买了水车、木料，把井箍好。水提上了原面，水流进了干旱的黄土里。第一季水地小麦每亩打了三百七十斤，比旱地多两倍。事实给了保守派有力的反击。但是大家在赞羡水地的好处的同时，也在算一笔账：打这样一眼浇地井，要花一千多元，占一个农业社一年公共积累的40％多，还要用一千二百多个工。结论是：好虽好，各社却都无力推广。
        辫子的启发
    人民公社的建立，使董志塬人民打井浇地战胜干旱的愿望成了现实。从肖金到白马，自东沟至西沟，纵横一百多里的田野上，几万杆红旗遮天蔽日，一杆旗下一支兵。两三个人包打一眼井。三万把剁枪、铁锨直戳地心，三万架辘轳日夜转动。第一批的三万眼水井不到一月就打成了。凯歌声中，又发生了新的困难：一口井一天只能出四、五方水。如果用“二仙传道”、“三仙传道”的办法提水浇地，光这三万眼井就得六、七万部水车，六、七万个劳动力和六、七万头大牲畜。中共庆阳县委第一书记包海珍日夜关心着这件事。他吃在工地，住在工地，井上井下到处观察。有时和社员谈谈话，有时翻开地图和资料，一个人在深思。他想到华北平原的地道战，也想过武山东梁渠上的长藤结瓜和葡萄串。他记起一位领导同志讲的对人对事都要“编辫子”。给水井也编编辫子，不是也可以吗？
    一天，在董志人民公社的打井工地上，包海珍对公社党委书记秦令仪说：“老秦，咱们给水井编编辫子怎么样？在井下开暗渠，把十个、百个、千个井串在一起。叫它井里也出水，渠里也出水，水都汇到中心大井里，小水聚成大水，集中成个地下水库。地势平的地方，用抽水机提水上原，坡度大的地方，在地下开渠，因势利导，叫高处的井水，从低处流出来，自流灌溉。”
    秦令仪热烈拥护这个办法。社员们也众口同声说：“好！人家修地上河，咱们来个地下河网！”
          在困难面前
    打三、五十米深的大井，已经够艰巨了，现在又要掏空地层，巧绣明渠暗道，这是更艰险、更复杂的劳动。定方向没有仪器，在窄狭低矮的暗渠里，一团漆黑，伸手不见五指，甚至连世界上最丰富的物质——空气，都特别缺乏。地下河网的开凿者，除去决心一条，铁锨一把外，是什么都没有。
    后官寨子工地上，有两个能干的姑娘，金梅英和丁凤英。两个人包打一段十米长的暗渠，要把两眼井连在一起。倔强的姑娘憋着劲大干了一天一夜，渠道已经挖了十五米，听对方暗渠里“蓬蓬”的挖土声音，时大时小，时强时弱，可是总也挖不通。方向定不准，失之毫厘，差之千里。两个姑娘不服气地爬上了地面。打井队长李广福和共青团支部书记白纪雄，在两个井口间用绳子拉了一条直线，把提土的辘轳重新安在这条线上。然后两个人下到井底按照头顶上辘轳的方向，在井下挖了一个小土槽，土槽里卡着一根电筒。电筒一亮，一道白光直射对面，井下的灯光和地上的方向完全相同。灯光既能照明，又指出了方向，顺着灯光挖去，没有多久，“哗啦”一声巨响，一块黄土塌了下来，相对的两道灯光交织在一起，照在四条牢牢紧抱的光臂膀上。胜利会师了。
    说也怪，方才井下还是闷热不堪，霎时间就变成了数九寒冬，原来，两个井打通以后暗渠变成了风巷，气温发生了急剧的变化。这就给工程带来了新的困难。只过了一夜，原来又松又软的泥土，就冻得硬如石板。铁锨挖不动。初步打通了的暗渠，不能开挖、扩大，整修通水。董志公社马家庄生产队队长马健民，想出了在井口上盖木板搭草帘，挡住地上的冷空气入井，借地下的热气暖化暗渠里的冻土。次日，马健民重新下到井底，摸一摸井壁，再不是那样冰凉扎手了。他满心高兴，举起铁锨就挖。忽然，“哗啦”一声，土塌下了一大堆，老马的右腿也埋在黄土里。井壁上还在不断地掉土，眼看就有活埋的危险。马健民急忙拔出腿，爬到刚刚塌下的土堆上，他没有考虑个人的安危，而是在想为什么冻土一消就酥得像豆腐渣一样？在寻找克服眼前的困难办法。他的眼前浮现出了安口煤矿井下坑木支撑的情况。爬上井，就领着社员找木料伐树枝，在井下架棚支撑扩大整修暗渠。木料不够，他又创造了蛇蜕皮的方法，开挖一段，支撑一段，用砖和水管衬砌一段，然后拆下坑木继续前进。人们在日夜奋战，暗渠在一步一步的延长。
        高原新面貌
    我曾经下过后官寨子一个被人们称作“井王”的大井里。这是一个直径五米的大井，从它的脚下有四条暗渠向四方伸去。暗渠开挖得犹如拱形的小城门，渠中流水淙淙。顺着每一条暗渠走去，都会碰见越来越多的状如叶脉的暗渠，每条渠上连着上百眼的水井。沿着通往西方的暗渠走去，经过七百五十米长的地下暗道，豁然开朗，头顶出现了一线蓝天，两岸是人们双手劈成的二十来米高的陡崖。水渠在这只有一米多宽的窄峡里，穿行四千五百米，便流到了南佐生产队的地面。记得三年前，当后官寨子乡的四个农业社开挖第一眼水井的时候，洪水就是顺着现在的渠道流到南佐的。它冲坏了南佐的土坝，淹没了南佐的农田。现在，人民公社把大家结成了一个同呼吸共命运的整体，南佐的地里浇上了从后官寨子引来的地下水。南佐的人说：“公社化了，心连心，地连片，洪水变成了清水，水害变成了水利”。
    今天的董志塬，十几万眼深井一齐吐水献宝。抽水机、高线运输器、自动喷水器，一条龙人工降雨器和自动灌溉车等，组成了抗旱保丰收的野战大军，提、浇、喷、灌五光十色。三十八万亩冬小麦饱饮了返青水，十万亩待播的夏秋田，也已墒足粪饱，静待摇耧撒籽。在高原的心脏里，地下河网的流水在永不休止的流着。几万把剁枪和铁锨在继续凿穿地层，战胜大自然的英雄们正在把地下河网织得更密、更长。
