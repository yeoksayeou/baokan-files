Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Seoul dispatch: The struggle of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee is in full swing. Another massive demonstration of 40,000 people broke out in Seoul today.

    According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, more than 4,500 students from Korea University in Seoul broke through the school gate at 1:00 PM today and began a demonstration. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with the dirty government!", "Immediately release the arrested Masan students!", "We want freedom!", "One million students unite and stand up!". They marched through Anam-dong and Dongdaemun towards Seoul's most bustling street, Jongno. Near Dongdaemun, they broke through five or six hundred police officers who were trying to stop them. Along the way, students from other schools and citizens joined the demonstration.

    The demonstration marched to the front of the South Korean puppet National Assembly Hall and held a demonstration for more than four hours. The demonstrating students passed and read out a resolution on the spot, calling on one million students in South Korea to stand up and expressing their determination to persist in the struggle until their demands are met.

    At around 6:30 PM, the demonstration arrived near Seoul City Hall and merged with another demonstration composed of students and citizens. According to South Korea's Dongyang News Agency, the number of participants in the demonstration reached 40,000 at this time.

    They marched in orderly ranks on the streets of Seoul, shouting slogans and advancing mightily. Some Rhee puppet police and secret agents mixed into the demonstration in an attempt to sabotage it, but were severely beaten by the masses and driven out of the ranks. Residents along the street warmly welcomed and supported the demonstrators, and they brought water from their homes for the demonstrators to drink.

    When the demonstration marched to the front of the US Embassy, they were blocked by a large number of police officers wielding clubs. The demonstrators fought with the police and shouted slogans such as "Release the arrested students."

    After the outbreak of the people's massive demonstration, the Syngman Rhee clique was panicked and hurriedly convened an emergency "cabinet" meeting to discuss measures to suppress the masses, and continued to send out a large number of police officers to suppress them. Syngman Rhee's armed police arrested demonstrators in the city. According to reports, fifty demonstrators were arrested as of this evening.

    According to Dongyang News Agency, at around 11:00 AM today, people in Dongnae near Busan also held a massive demonstration against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee. More than 1,000 students from Dongnae High School who participated in the demonstration shouted slogans such as "Immediately release the arrested Masan students" and marched towards Busan.

    The Syngman Rhee clique hurriedly mobilized police from the three police stations of Busan, East Busan, and Dongnae to suppress them, firing shots at the students as a warning and using water cannons and tear gas. However, the students were not afraid at all. They fought back with stones, destroyed a fire truck carrying a water cannon, and injured two police officers. The demonstration finally broke through the police cordon and continued until noon.

    In addition, according to World News Agency, this morning, people were preparing to hold demonstrations everywhere in Busan City. The Rhee puppet police in Busan hurriedly transferred the Rhee puppet police who had been sent to Masan to suppress the people back to strengthen their vigilance.

    There are also reports that in Chungju, more than 1,000 students also held a demonstration against Syngman Rhee this afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 17th: Seoul dispatch: Despite the Syngman Rhee clique's exhausting all means to brutally suppress them, the demonstrations of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee are still rising one after another.

    In the cities surrounding Masan, such as Jinju, Jangyeon, and Hadong, many people gathered together today to prepare for demonstrations against Syngman Rhee. However, these marches were temporarily unable to take place because Syngman Rhee's armed police rushed to suppress them with bayonets, tear gas, and other weapons.

    In the important port of Incheon, hundreds of people held a rally at the headquarters of the opposition Democratic Party to protest Syngman Rhee's deceptive "presidential election" held on March 15th. They shouted slogans: Syngman Rhee step down! The Syngman Rhee clique sent about 1,000 police officers, carrying tear gas and water cannons, to surround the building and prevent them from marching and demonstrating in the streets. The people holding the rally held an "indoor demonstration" and distributed leaflets from the windows to the outside.

    In Masan City, twenty demonstrators who were injured by Syngman Rhee's police, disregarding the threats of the Syngman Rhee clique, met with the "National Assembly" investigation team today, demanding the immediate arrest of the police who shot and killed the demonstrators.

    The situation in Masan is still very tense. Syngman Rhee's armed police are patrolling every street and alley in Masan City, continuing to implement a curfew of more than ten hours a day. According to reports, Syngman Rhee's police authorities have arrested 800 demonstrators. Although Masan City is temporarily in a state of "calm" under "martial law," even the Associated Press admitted that "no one can determine whether this phenomenon will continue."

    At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique police authorities admitted today that the tear gas used in the bloody suppression of the people in Masan City on March 15th was purchased with American "aid funds." Agence France-Presse quoted Seoul "observers" as saying, "This puts the US authorities in a very embarrassing position."

    反对法西斯统治的怒火烧到了李承晚的跟前
    汉城四万人举行大示威
    李承晚集团召开紧急会议并出动大批军警镇压
    据新华社18日讯　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争方兴未艾。汉城今天又爆发了四万人的大示威。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，汉城高丽大学的全校学生四千五百多人今天下午一时冲破了学校的大门，开始示威游行。示威队伍高呼：“打倒肮脏的政府！”、“立即释放被逮捕的马山学生！”、“要自由！”、“一百万学生团结一致站起来！”等口号。他们经过安岩洞、东大门涌向汉城最繁华的大街——钟路。他们在东大门附近冲过了企图阻拦他们的五六百名警察。沿路，有许多其它学校的学生和市民参加了示威队伍。
    示威队伍一直游行到南朝鲜伪国会议事堂前，举行了四个多小时的示威。示威的学生们当场通过并宣读了一项决议，呼吁南朝鲜的一百万学生站起来，并且表示学生们决心坚持斗争，直到他们的要求得到满足为止。
    下午六时半左右，示威队伍到达汉城市政厅附近，同另一队由学生和市民组成的示威队伍汇合，据南朝鲜东洋通讯社报道，这时，参加示威的人数达到四万人。
    他们排着整齐的队伍在汉城的街道上高呼口号，浩浩荡荡地前进。有的李伪警察、特务混进示威队伍，企图进行破坏，遭到群众的痛打，并被赶出队伍。沿街居民热烈地欢迎和支持示威的人们，他们纷纷从家中拿出水来，给示威的人们喝。
    示威的队伍游行到美国大使馆门前时，遇到了大批挥舞着棍棒的警察进行阻拦。示威群众同警察展开了搏斗，并高呼“释放被逮捕的学生”等口号。
    在人民大示威爆发后，李承晚集团惊慌失措，慌忙地召开了“内阁”紧急会议，商量镇压群众的措施，并继续派出大批警察进行镇压。李承晚的武装警察在市内大肆逮捕示威者。有消息说，到今天晚间，被逮捕的示威者有五十人。
    另据东洋通讯社报道，今天上午十一时左右，在釜山附近的东莱，人民也举行了大示威，反对李承晚法西斯统治。举行示威的东莱高等学校的一千多名学生高呼“立即释放被逮捕的马山学生”等口号，向釜山方向进发。
    李承晚集团慌忙调集釜山、东釜山和东莱三个警察署的警察赶来镇压，向学生开枪进行威吓，并使用了水龙和催泪弹。但是，学生们毫不畏惧，他们用石头回击并打毁了一辆载有水龙的消防车，还打伤了两名警察。示威队伍终于冲破了警察布下的警戒网前进，直到中午示威还在继续中。
    另外，据世界通讯社报道，今天上午，在釜山市内到处有人准备举行示威。釜山的李伪警察慌忙把派到马山去镇压人民的李伪警察调回，来加紧警戒。
    还有消息说，在忠州，一千多名学生今天下午也举行了反对李承晚的示威游行。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：尽管李承晚集团用尽各种手段残暴镇压，南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的示威仍在此伏彼起。
    在马山周围的晋州、长渊、河东等城市，今天都有许多人聚集在一起，准备举行反对李承晚的示威游行。只是由于李承晚的武装警察赶往用刺刀、催泪弹等武器进行镇压，这些游行暂时未能举行。
    在重要港口仁川，有几百人在反对党民主党的党部举行集会，抗议李承晚在3月15日举行的欺骗的“总统选举”，他们高呼口号：李承晚下台！李承晚集团派了约一千名警察，带着催泪弹、水龙，包围了这个建筑物，阻止他们上街游行示威。集会的人举行了“室内示威”，并且从窗口向外面散发传单。
    在马山市，二十名被李承晚警察打伤的示威者不顾李承晚集团的威胁，今天去会见“国会”调查团人员，要求立即逮捕开枪杀害示威者的警察。
    马山局势仍然很紧张。李承晚的武装警察在马山市的每个街巷进行巡逻，继续实行一天十几小时的宵禁。据报道，李承晚的警察当局已经逮捕了八百个示威者。虽然马山市在“戒严”情况下暂时处于“平静”状态。但是，美联社也承认：“没有人能断定这种现象将会继续下去”。
    同时，李承晚集团警察当局今天承认在3月15日对马山市人民进行血腥镇压中使用的催泪弹是用美国的“援款”购买的。法新社援引汉城的“观察家”的话说，“这使美国当局处于很尴尬的地位”。
