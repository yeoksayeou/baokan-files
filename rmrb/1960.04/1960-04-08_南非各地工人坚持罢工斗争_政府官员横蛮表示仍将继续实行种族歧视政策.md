Xinhua News Agency, April 7th, Cape Town News: South African colonialists spent the 6th in a tense atmosphere, marking the 308th anniversary of the first arrival of white colonialists in the Union of South Africa. On April 1652, 308 years ago, the Dutchman Van Riebeeck established the first colonial area in Cape Town. The government of the Union of South Africa later designated this day as a holiday.

    Currently, the African townships in the suburbs of Cape Town have become one of the main centers for Africans to resist the brutal rule of the South African government. On the 6th, in the Nyanga township, which houses 25,000 Africans, the vast majority of workers were still persisting in their strike.

    Reports say that the South African government's military police were on high alert around Nyanga. Troops with fixed bayonets were stationed every thirty to fifty yards, some with machine guns and armored vehicles. Helicopters circled overhead during the day; at night, searchlights mounted on trucks illuminated the entire town.

    The brutality of the military police further stimulated the Africans' will to resist. Two leaders of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) who have not yet been arrested told a United Press International reporter that the South African authorities "take such extreme actions against us, while at the same time talking about their love for the African people, they have now proven how untrustworthy they are." The two PAC leaders, who asked not to be named, said that the incident last week in which a soldier shot and killed an eighteen-month-old girl particularly enraged the people of Nyanga. It is said that this incident occurred when the baby was forcibly pulled off her mother's back as the mother was on her way to the hospital.

    On the same day, South African government military police, supported by armored vehicles, stormed the Smith's Workers' Hostel near the Lamontville township in the suburbs of Durban. They forcibly coerced approximately 4,500 African workers living in this hostel to leave the hostel and go to work, and arrested at least 300 people. All the workers in this hostel started their strike on the 4th.

    In other parts of South Africa, the South African authorities again dispatched large numbers of military police on the 6th to search and arrest members of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), as well as others who opposed racial discrimination policies.

    The South African Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, de Wet Nel, declared in a statement on the 5th that the government of the Union of South Africa would continue to implement racial discrimination policies. Minister of Justice Erasmus threatened on the evening of the 6th that the "pass" system had not been abolished by the South African authorities, and he also induced Africans who had discarded their "passes" to apply for temporary replacements. He said that "in order to reimplement control measures," police officers will be able to demand that Africans show their "passes" again. It was previously reported that the South African government, in order to ease the people's fighting mood, had announced on March 26th that it would temporarily cease arresting Africans who did not carry "passes."

    In order to step up the suppression of the people's resistance, the South African government introduced a new reactionary bill in parliament on the 6th, attempting to further stifle the publication and distribution of progressive books, newspapers, and films.

    Reports say that because the South African people launched a large-scale struggle against racial discrimination, especially the widespread strike struggle of African workers, which severely hit the colonial interests of South African capitalists, some South African capitalists have recently been planning to change their methods in order to continue to maintain their brutal exploitation. According to a report in the Johannesburg "Star" on the 6th, leaders of South African industry and commerce requested a meeting with South African Prime Minister Verwoerd on the 6th to discuss this issue.

    According to a recent report in the British "Financial Times," since the South African people's struggle entered its climax, the price of South African stocks on the London and Johannesburg markets had fallen by approximately £500 million in late March. The index of South African gold mining stocks, with the autumn of 1955 as 100, had fallen to 70.2 by March 30th of this year.

### 南非各地工人坚持罢工斗争  政府官员横蛮表示仍将继续实行种族歧视政策

    南非各地工人坚持罢工斗争
    政府官员横蛮表示仍将继续实行种族歧视政策
    新华社7日讯　开普敦消息：南非殖民者6日在紧张的气氛中度过了白人殖民者第一次到达南非联邦的第三○八周年纪念。三百零八年前的1652年4月，荷兰人范雷比克在开普敦建立了第一个殖民区。南非联邦政府后来把这一天订为假日。
    目前，开普敦郊区的非洲人市镇已经成了非洲人反抗南非政府残暴统治的主要中心之一。6日，在住有二万五千名非洲人的尼安加市镇，绝大部分的工人还在坚持罢工。
    消息说，南非政府的军警在尼安加周围如临大敌。插上刺刀的军队在每隔三十码到五十码的地方就布置一个岗哨，有的地方还配有机关枪，停放着装甲车。白天，直升飞机在上空盘旋；夜间，装在卡车上的探照灯向全镇照射。
    军警的暴行更加激发了非洲人的反抗意志。两位仍未被捕的泛非主义者大会的领袖对合众国际社记者说，南非当局“采取这样极端的行动对付我们，同时又在谈论他们对非洲人民的热爱，他们现在已经证明了他们是怎么不值得信任。”这两位要求不要发表他们的姓名的泛非主义者大会的领袖说，上周一个士兵枪杀一个十八个月的女婴儿的事件，使尼安加的人民特别感到激怒。据说这个事件是在这个婴儿的母亲前往医院的途中硬把她从她母亲的背上拉下来的时候发生的。
    同一天，南非政府的军警在装甲车的配合下冲进了德班郊区拉蒙特维尔市镇附近的史密斯工人宿舍。他们以武力胁迫住在这个宿舍里的大约四千五百名非洲工人离开宿舍去上工，并且至少逮捕了三百多人。这个宿舍里的全体工人是从4日起开始罢工的。
    在南非其他一些地方，南非当局在6日又出动大批军警搜捕非洲人国民大会和泛非主义者大会的成员及其他反对种族歧视政策的人。
    南非班图行政开发部长德威特尼尔5日发表声明宣称，南非联邦政府将继续实行种族歧视政策。司法部长伊来斯马斯6日晚扬言，“通行证”制度并未被南非当局废除，他并且诱迫已经弃毁“通行证”的非洲人去申请补发临时证件。他说，“为了重新实行控制措施”，警官将能再度要求非洲人出示“通行证”。前已报道，南非政府为了缓和人民的斗争情绪，曾在3月26日宣布暂时停止逮捕没有携带“通行证”的非洲人。
    南非政府为了加紧镇压人民的反抗，6日又在议会提出一项新的反动法案，企图进一步扼杀进步书籍、报刊、电影的出版和发行。
    有消息说，由于南非人民展开声势浩大的反对种族歧视斗争、特别是非洲工人广泛开展的罢工斗争，狠狠地打击了南非资本家的殖民利益，因此，南非一些资本家最近正在策划改变作法，以继续维持他们的残酷剥削。据约翰内斯堡“星报”6日报道，南非工商界领袖已在6日要求会见南非总理维沃尔德就这个问题进行商谈。
    据英国“金融时报”最近报道，自从南非人民的斗争进入高潮后，南非的股票在伦敦和约翰内斯堡市场上的价格在3月下旬已经下跌了五亿镑左右。南非金矿股票的指数如以1955年秋季为一百，在今年3月30日已经下跌到七十点二。
