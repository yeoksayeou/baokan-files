Fuzhou, April 11th (Reported by our newspaper) - Fujian has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of barley and wheat.

Fujian Province's four million mu of barley and wheat have entered the yellowing and harvesting season from south to north. From the coastal plains to the mountainous areas, a scene of bumper harvest is emerging everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from the more than 750,000 mu of wheat and barley already harvested across the province, the average yield per unit area has generally increased significantly compared to last year. The Jinjiang area, which has the most wheat cultivation in the province, has seen particularly significant increases in the 420,000 mu of wheat and barley already harvested. In Putian County of this area, the average yield per mu of the 128,000 mu of barley and wheat already harvested by various communes has more than doubled compared to last year. In the hilly area of Yunxiao County, the Dongxia Commune's 881 mu of barley and wheat already harvested has achieved an average yield of 500 jin per mu. The youth team and the "Skillful Sisters" team of the Dabian Brigade of the Guanbi Commune in the mountainous area of Zhao'an County have created a high-yield record of an average of 470 to 482 jin per mu on 34 mu of high-yield wheat fields, with 14 mu averaging over 600 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield per mu of early rice last year. The 1,400 mu of wheat and barley already harvested by the Chengguan Commune in Fuqing County, located along the coast in the Minhou area, has also seen an average yield increase of 70% to 100% compared to last year. Barley and wheat in the mountainous areas of Longyan, Nanping, and Fu'an areas are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected. The large-scale bumper harvest of barley and wheat has changed the long-standing argument that Fujian cannot grow a variety of barley and wheat and that barley and wheat are low-yield crops, changing the old concept that people believe southern China cannot grow barley and wheat on a large scale and cannot achieve large-scale high yields.

Based on past high-yield cases of barley and wheat cultivation and Fujian's climatic conditions, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee believed that winter-grown barley and wheat should be regarded as an important grain harvest in one season. Therefore, last winter, it decided to greatly expand the planting area and decided to strengthen the management of barley and wheat as a staple food for one season. Before expanding the planting area, various places launched debates among the masses on expanding the planting of barley and wheat. On the basis of unified thinking, they successfully overfulfilled the expansion plan and strengthened field management after expanding the planting area.

The bumper harvest of barley and wheat in Fujian Province is a victory in implementing the policy of extensive planting, high yield, and abundant harvest. The total planting area of spring-harvested barley and wheat in the province is 4 million mu, an increase of nearly twofold compared to last year's 1.44 million mu, and an increase of 62.6% compared to 1957 (2.46 million mu), the year with the most barley and wheat planting in history. Fujian has a warm climate, and wheat grows quickly with a short growth period. In most areas, early rice can still be planted after harvesting wheat. In order not to violate the farming season, various places have reasonably advanced the sowing period of barley and wheat, so as to both expand the planting area of barley and wheat and carry out early rice sowing and transplanting in a timely manner after harvesting barley and wheat. This has changed the past two harvests a year to three harvests. In order to manage barley and wheat as an important grain harvest for one season, various places in the province have universally proposed and carried out high-yield competitions for wheat catching up with early rice. Party committees at all levels have focused on barley and wheat production as much as they focus on rice, grasping a series of yield-increasing measures one after another until the harvest is stored in the granary, so the wheat yield of some communes and teams has caught up with the early rice yield.

The bumper harvest of barley and wheat is also a great victory in fighting drought and rushing to plant, and fighting drought to ensure harvest. From the beginning of sowing barley and wheat last winter until maturity, there was no heavy rain for more than 160 consecutive days across the province. In order to ensure the completion of the expansion plan, the communes and brigades first concentrated their efforts on fighting drought and rushing to plant, completing the expansion task on time. Subsequently, they organized specialized teams for wheat field management by brigade or production team, topdressing fertilizer, weeding, preventing frost, and persisting in the struggle against long-term drought irrigation and pest control. In January and February this year, when barley and wheat were in the peak period of jointing and booting, the drought situation further developed. Under the strong leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Party Committees at all levels, various places launched a large-scale drought-fighting collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of people fighting drought and irrigating wheat declared war on the heavens, so that drought-stricken wheat fields were quickly irrigated. In the Fuqing County communes' great competition to fight drought and protect wheat, all the county's 230,000 mu of barley and wheat were universally watered one to three times in a matter of days. After overcoming the spring drought in various places, continuous spring rains began in mid-March, and some areas experienced wheat rust. Communes in various places, according to the Provincial Party Committee's instructions to seize the opportunity to do a good job in preventing wheat rust, took advantage of the victory to advance and continuously and universally launched a struggle to prevent rust and protect the harvest. Various places generally adopted effective methods of spraying lime-sulfur mixture for prevention. In the Fu'an area alone, the communes organized more than 50,000 people to spray lime-sulfur mixture on 150,000 mu of wheat affected by rust, effectively controlling the spread of rust.

The large-scale bumper harvest of barley and wheat has further encouraged the broad masses and cadres, who have devoted themselves to the spring plowing and sowing upsurge with greater enthusiasm, striving for a greater summer agricultural harvest. Up to now, while rushing to harvest barley and wheat, the area of early rice transplanting and direct sowing in the province has increased by more than 58% compared to the same period last year.

    我国南方传来今年农业丰收的第一个喜讯
    福建大麦小麦齐丰收
    播种面积扩大近二倍，使一年两收改为三收，在战胜各种灾害中得到大丰收，改变了南方不能大面积种麦和丰产的旧观念
    本报福州11日电　福建大麦小麦获得了大面积丰收。
    福建省四百万亩大小麦已由南到北进入黄熟和收获大忙季节。从沿海平原到山区，到处出现一片大丰收景象。据全省已经收获的七十五万多亩小麦和大麦的不完全统计，平均单位产量一般都比去年有很大的增加。全省种麦最多的晋江专区已收获的四十二万多亩小麦和大麦，增产特别显著。这个专区的莆田县各公社已收获的十二万八千多亩大小麦，平均亩产比去年跃增一倍以上。丘陵地带的云霄县东厦公社已收获的八百八十一亩大小麦，平均亩产达五百斤。诏安县山区官陂公社大边大队青年队和妇女巧姐妹队已收的三十四亩小麦丰产片，创造了山区平均亩产四百七十斤到四百八十二斤的丰产纪录，其中有十四亩平均亩产超过六百斤，超过了去年早稻平均单产水平。闽侯专区沿海的福清县城关公社已收获的一千四百多亩小麦和大麦，平均亩产也比去年增产七成到一倍左右。龙岩、南平、福安专区等各山区的大麦和小麦，也都生长得很好，丰收在望。大小麦的大面积丰收，改变了历年来福建不能多种大小麦和大小麦是低产作物的论调，改变了人们认为南方不能大面积种植大小麦和不能大面积丰产的旧观念。
    中共福建省委根据过去种植大麦小麦也有高产的情况和福建的气候条件，认为冬种大小麦完全应该作为重要的一季粮食收成，因而在去冬决定大量扩种，并决定把大麦小麦作为一季主粮加强管理。各地在扩种前，发动群众开展了扩种大小麦的辩论，在统一思想的基础上，胜利地超额完成了扩种计划，并在扩种之后，加强了田间管理。
    福建省大小麦的丰收是贯彻广种高产多收方针的胜利。全省春收大小麦种植面积共有四百万亩，比去年一百四十四万亩扩大近二倍，比历史上大小麦种植最多的1957年（二百四十六万亩）增加了62.6％。福建气候温暖，麦子生长快，生长期短，大部分地区收割麦子后还可以种早稻。为了不违农时，各地都合理地提早了大小麦的播种期，作到既扩大大麦小麦种植面积，又能在收割大小麦之后适时地进行早稻播种插秧。这样就把过去一年两季收成改为三季。为了把大小麦作为重要的一季粮食收成进行经营，全省各地普遍提出并进行了小麦赶早稻的丰产竞赛。各级党委都像抓稻谷那样大抓大小麦生产，把一系列的增产措施一环扣一环地一直抓到收获入仓，因而若干社、队的小麦产量赶上了早稻产量。
    大小麦大丰收也是抗旱抢种、抗旱保收的伟大胜利。全省各地从去冬大小麦开始播种直到成熟，连续一百六十多天没有下过透雨。为了保证完成扩种计划，各公社和大队首先集中力量进行了抗旱抢种，按时完成了扩种任务；随后便以大队或生产队为单位，组织了麦田管理专业队，适时追肥、除草、防冻，并坚持了长期抗旱浇麦和防治病虫害的斗争。今年1、2月间，正当大小麦拔节孕穗盛期，旱情又有进一步发展，在省委和各级党委的坚强领导下，各地又展开了抗旱大协作。数十万抗旱浇麦大军向天公宣战，使受旱麦田迅速得到浇灌。福清县各公社在抗旱保麦大竞赛中，几天时间就把全县二十三万多亩大小麦普遍浇水一遍到三遍。在各地战胜春旱之后，从3月中旬起，又逢春雨连绵，有些地区发生小麦锈病。各地公社根据省委及早抓紧作好防治小麦锈病的指示，乘胜前进，连续地普遍地展开了防治锈病保丰收的斗争。各地普遍采取喷射石灰硫磺合剂的有效办法进行了预防，单是福安专区各公社就组织了五万多人给十五万亩发生锈病的小麦喷射了石灰硫磺合剂，有力地控制了锈病的蔓延。
    大小麦的大面积丰产，进一步鼓舞了广大群众和干部，他们以更大的劲头投入了春耕春种热潮，力争夏季农业更大丰收。到目前为止，全省在赶收大小麦的同时，早稻插秧和直播面积都比去年同期猛增58％以上。（附图片）
