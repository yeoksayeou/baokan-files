Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 10th. Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Deputy Prime Minister, pointed out at a conference on developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives recently held in Vinh Phuc Province that 1960 will be the year that North Vietnam basically completes elementary cooperativization, while further consolidating the agricultural cooperativization movement.

In his speech, Truong Chinh explained the Vietnam Workers' Party Central Committee's current stance on agricultural cooperativization.

He talked about several issues that must be paid attention to in the current agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. He emphasized that ideological work in cooperatives must take the lead. Only when the members have the correct ideology can their actions be correct, and only then can the cooperatives be consolidated. He said that members should be educated with the ideas of being masters of their own affairs, regarding the cooperative as their home, running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, opposing corruption and waste, and overcoming dependence on the state. He also pointed out that ideological work must be carried out regularly, continuously, and with a focus.

Talking about improving technology, Truong Chinh pointed out that it is necessary to promote the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and to overcome conservative ideas. He also pointed out that technological improvement must proceed from the low to the high, from the simple to the complex, and gradually improve on the original basis, from simple technological improvements to semi-mechanization, and then to mechanization. He emphasized that it is necessary to follow the mass line and mobilize the masses to actively participate in technological improvements.

In his speech, Truong Chinh also talked about improving the management of cooperatives and strengthening leadership.
