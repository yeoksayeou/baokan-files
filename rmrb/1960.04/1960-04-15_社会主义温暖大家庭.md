The Socialist Warm Big Family
		Zhang Furan, Female Commune Member of Chengguan Commune, Xinle, Hebei

	Today I got up early, and our Second Team was planting spring wheat in the east of the village. Everyone is really motivated. When the bell for breakfast rang in the village, some commune members were still reluctant to straighten up.
	"Pack up your tools and go back to the village for dinner," the captain said to me.
	I shook my head and said, "Let's finish planting these few mu before we go."
	"No need to go!" Someone shouted behind me. I turned around and saw Li Yin'xue, the cook from our Second Team's canteen, carrying a food basket and smiling at me.
	"Why are you bringing food to the field?" I asked her.
	"Why aren't you leaving work to go back to the village?" she retorted.
	"We want to plant a few more mu of wheat."
	"So do we!"
	The captain found our questions and answers amusing and said with a laugh, "You don't need to discuss it, you've already become of one mind."
	The phrase "become of one mind" immediately touched my heart, and as I took the steaming hot corn noodles from Yin'xue, I began to think about things:
	Since the establishment of the canteen, everyone's hearts have been linked together, all thinking about realizing "thousands, hundreds, and tens of thousands." Before, not to mention a production team, even my own family of several people couldn't agree on many things. Take eating, for example: At that time, I said go to the fields first and then eat, my husband wanted to eat first and then go to the fields, and my mother-in-law would chime in, "Bingchen goes to the fields, you cook at home." No matter how busy production was, three people had three different ideas. Since the establishment of the canteen, the whole family eats in the canteen. Bingchen's thinking has slowly changed. One day, he said to me, "We're eating from the same pot, and others are thinking about doing a good job in square-field production. It's not right for me to only think about my own convenience." My mother-in-law now eats when it's time to eat and has stopped creating conflict over meals.
      ☆　☆　☆
	In the evening, I entered the village and went to the canteen's courtyard.
	"Sister-in-law," the cook Qiu Guo greeted me, "It's not time to eat yet. You just got off work, why didn't you go home to rest? Why did you come to the canteen again?"
	I couldn't answer for a moment. I don't know why, but every day after work, my feet turn into the canteen as soon as I enter the village. At the time, I could only stammeringly reply to Qiu Guo, "I came to see if your 'all-purpose stove' has been installed yet?"
	"We're just missing three or four grate bars, and we can't buy them for the time being."
	I thought that I had a few iron rods at home that were thrown aside, maybe they could be used, so I hurried home. In the corner of the room, I found the old iron rods and also discovered two dust-covered "Da Chu Yin pots" placed aside. My mother-in-law said, "Furan, do you think the canteen can use these two pots?" "They can be used." I thought that if the canteen had an all-purpose stove, these two pots would be perfect for making soup or something.
      ☆　☆　☆
	After dinner, Bingchen and I picked up the children from the kindergarten. These two hadn't seen each other all day and started playing around. Bingchen is always happy now. Before there was a canteen in the village, he had quite a temper. Sometimes I came back from the fields and couldn't cook in time, so he would slam the pots and bang the table, and even take it out on the children. At that time, could you blame me? When I got home, two or three children were pestering me, how could I eat in peace?
	The family was just having fun, and didn't even hear the folk school bell ring. My mother-in-law, with her good memory, urged us, "Hurry up and go to folk school!"
	I took the schoolbag from Bingchen and thought as I walked: If there was no canteen, could I, who has a mother-in-law above me and children below me, go to folk school in peace?
	At folk school, we not only learn culture, but also politics and study Chairman Mao's works. These days, the branch committee member has been teaching us about "consolidating the strong bastion of socialism." After listening to this lesson, my heart became brighter and more comfortable. Originally, with the canteen, our family, like everyone in the village, eats from the same pot, plants the same land, and increases our collectivist thinking. Not only is life happy, but our production drive is also stronger. The canteen is our socialist warm big family, the root of our happiness for generations to come!

### 社会主义温暖大家庭

    社会主义温暖大家庭	河北新乐城关公社女社员　张富然
    今天起早，俺们二队，就在村东种春小麦。大伙的干劲真足，村里响起了吃早饭的钟声，有的社员还不肯直起腰来。
    “收拾工具回村吃饭。”队长对我说。
    我摇了摇头说：“等种完了这几亩再走。”
    “不用走啦！”有人在我背后喊了一嗓子，我回头一看，只见我们二队食堂炊事员李银雪担着饭篮，正对着我笑哩。
    “你们怎么送饭上地？”我问她。
    “你们怎么不下工回村？”她反问我。
    “我们为了多种几亩小麦。”
    “我们也是呀！”
    队长见我们问答得有趣，打着哈哈说：“你们不用商量，倒成了一个心眼。”
    “成了一个心眼”这句话，立刻打动了我的心，我接过银雪递过来的热气腾腾的杂面餄餎，就想开了心事：
    从成立食堂以来，大伙心就拧在一起，都想着实现“千、百、万”。早先，不用说一个生产队，就是像我一家几口人，好多事想不到一起。就说吃饭吧：那时候，我说先下地后吃饭，我的丈夫就要先吃了饭再下地，我那婆婆就插进来说：“丙辰下地，你在家做饭。”不管生产多么紧张，三个人就是三个想法。成立食堂以来，一家人都在食堂吃饭，丙辰的思想慢慢就变了，有一天，他对我说：“吃的是一锅饭，人家想的是把方田生产搞好，俺光图自己方便可不沾气。”我婆婆到了时候就吃饭，也绝了为吃饭生是非的心。
      ☆　☆　☆
    傍晚时分进了村，我就进了食堂的院子。
    “嫂子，”炊事员秋果迎上来说，“过一会才吃饭哩，下工回来，也不到家歇歇，怎么又到食堂来了？”
    我一时答不上来。我这双脚就不知怎么的，每天下工进村，一拐弯就走进了食堂。当时，我只好吞吞吐吐地回答秋果：“我是来看看你们的‘万能灶’安上了没有？”
    “就缺三、四根炉条，一时也买不到。”
    我一想家里有几根铁棍子扔在一边，也许用得着，就赶忙回家。在屋角里找到了旧铁棍，还发现两口落满尘土的“大初印锅”，放在一旁。俺婆婆说：“富然，这两口锅不知食堂用得上吗？”“用得上。”我想食堂有了万能灶，这两口锅要做些汤什么的，不是挺合适吗？
      ☆　☆　☆
    吃罢晚饭，我和丙辰把在幼儿园里的孩子接回了家，这爷俩一天不见面，又逗闹起来。丙辰这个人，现在天天喜喜哈哈的。从前村里没有食堂时，他的脾气可大了。有时我下地回来，赶不上做饭，他就摔盆拍桌的，还拿孩子撒气。那时节，能怪我吗？回到家来两三个孩子缠着我，能吃安生饭吗？
    一家人只顾欢乐，连民校打钟也没听到，还是婆婆记心好催着我们：“快上民校去吧！”
    我从丙辰手里接过书包，一路走一路就想着：要是没有食堂，我这个上有婆婆、下有孩子的人，能安安然然地上民校吗？
    在民校，我们不光学文化，还学政治、学习毛主席著作。这几天，支部委员就给我们讲“巩固社会主义的坚强阵地”。听了这一课，我心里更明亮，更舒畅了。本来么，有了食堂，我们一家和全村里的人一样，吃一锅饭，种一方地，增长了集体主义思想，不但生活愉快，生产劲头也更足了。食堂是我们的社会主义温暖大家庭，是我们子子孙孙的幸福根！
