High Speed at Sanmenxia
Representative Wang Huzhen Discusses Two Major Transformations Coming to Sanmenxia

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the report on the draft 1960 national economic plan given by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft given by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. I suggest that the congress approve them.

The great achievements made in the continuous Great Leap Forward of our national economic construction in 1958 and 1959 were unanimously considered by the representatives in their group discussions to be summed up as the victory of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the victory of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This summary is entirely correct. Since our country possesses so many factors conducive to building socialism, there is no doubt that 1960 will still be a year of continued Great Leap Forward in national economic construction. The 1960 national economic construction plan and state budget reported by the two vice premiers will surely be supported by the people of the whole country and achieve brilliant success.

The high-speed construction of the Sanmenxia project on the Yellow River, where I work, is a concrete example of the countless Great Leap Forward achievements on our economic construction front. Originally, the completion period for an engineering project of the scale of Sanmenxia in a non-socialist country would not be very short, and often exceed ten years. We originally planned to complete the project in six years, which was already a fast construction plan. Unexpectedly, in the second year after construction started, we entered the period of the nationwide, vigorous Great Leap Forward. On the construction site, everyone chased and surpassed each other, the atmosphere was bustling, and new records emerged one after another. As a result, the original six-year completion period was shortened to three and a half years. Without the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the deep-rootedness of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great role of the three magic weapons, it would be unimaginable for the Sanmenxia project to have such a great leap forward.

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party committee, the Sanmenxia project achieved two consecutive stages of victory. The first stage was in July of that year, when it blocked four floods exceeding 10,000 cubic meters per second in the Yellow River flood season, allowing tens of millions of people downstream to safely pass the flood season. The second stage was, under the inspiration of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, we comprehensively completed various tasks for 1959 twenty-two days ahead of schedule and entered 1960 ahead of schedule.

On the basis of the above materials, the red flag of better continued leap forward in 1960 is flying.

1960 will be the year of the victorious completion of the Sanmenxia Dam project. The most important Sanmenxia project in the comprehensive plan report on harnessing the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources, which was solemnly approved by the representatives at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress in 1955, will become a reality and will forever stand on the territory of our Chinese nation.

This year, the historically disaster-prone Yellow River in our country will undergo two major transformations.

The first major transformation is that, starting in July this year, people will be able to control the floods occurring upstream of the Sanmenxia on the Yellow River according to their own will. In late June, we plan to install gates in the spillways, so that the discharged water volume is controlled by the gates, so that it does not exceed the safety level allowed by the downstream riverbed. If a flood occurs in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, as long as some of the gates are closed, the outflow can be reduced to below 6,000 cubic meters per second. If necessary, more gates can be closed, so that within seven days, the outflow does not exceed 1,000 cubic meters per second. The water volume that cannot be discharged due to the closure of the gates will all be stored in the reservoir. In the future, with the construction of a number of tributary reservoirs and the good work of water and soil conservation, the historical Yellow River water disasters that have caused the people downstream of the Yellow River to suffer will be gone forever.

The second major transformation is that the Sanmenxia Dam can be completed within this year, creating a man-made lake between Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan that is even larger than Taihu Lake. The Sanmenxia Dam is entirely made of cast concrete. In the future, as long as 80,000 to 90,000 cubic meters of concrete are poured each month, the dam can be completed as scheduled. On the Sanmenxia construction site, there is the strong leadership of the Party committee, the selfless assistance of many Soviet experts, the soaring enthusiasm of all workers and cadres, many commanders and fighters who participated in the War of Liberation are at the forefront, responsible for command, the technical revolution and technical innovation movement are rising vigorously, and the mechanized, automated, and continuous production equipment specially designed and manufactured for the Sanmenxia construction have been used skillfully and exerted great power. Therefore, we have full confidence in completing the Sanmenxia Dam project as scheduled.

If the above speech is appropriate, please correct me, representatives.

### 高速度在三门峡  汪胡桢代表谈三门峡即将到来的两大变革

    高速度在三门峡
    汪胡桢代表谈三门峡即将到来的两大变革主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理所作关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，建议大会予以通过。
    我国1958年和1959年国民经济建设连续大跃进所取得的伟大成绩在代表们小组讨论会上一致认为应当总结为总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝的胜利，为党中央的正确领导的胜利，为毛泽东思想的胜利。这个总结是完全正确的。我国既然存在着这许多有利于建设社会主义的因素，1960年国民经济建设无疑地仍然是继续大跃进的一年。两位副总理所报告的1960年国民经济建设计划和国家预算一定可以得到全国人民的拥护，获得辉煌的成就。
    我所服务的黄河三门峡工程的高速度建设就是我国经济建设阵线上无数大跃进成绩的一个实在的例子。本来像三门峡那样规模的工程在非社会主义的国家里完成期限总不很短，超过十年的也是常有的。我们原来打算用六年的时间来完成这个工程，已经是一个快速的施工计划。不料在开工后的第二年就进入全国轰轰烈烈、万马奔腾的大跃进时期。工地上你追我赶，热火朝天，新纪录层出不穷，月进度一翻再翻，结果把原定六年完工的期限缩短为三年半。如果没有党中央的正确领导，毛泽东思想的深入人心，和三大法宝的伟大作用，而要求三门峡工程能发生这样伟大跃进是不可想像的。
    在1959年里，三门峡工程在党委领导下就接连取得两个阶段的胜利。第一阶段为在这一年的7月，拦住了黄河汛期中四次超过一万秒立方米的洪水，使下游数千万人民安全地渡过了汛期。第二阶段为在党的八届八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的鼓舞下，我们提前二十二天全面地完成了1959年各项任务，提前跨入了1960年。
    在上述物质的基础上，就飘扬着1960年更好的继续跃进的红旗。
    1960年将是三门峡大坝工程胜利完成的一年。1955年全国人民代表大会第一届第二次会议上代表们庄严地举手通过的关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划报告中最重要的三门峡工程就要成为现实，要永远树立在我中华民族的疆土上。
    就在今年，我国历史上多灾多难的黄河将要发生两大变革。
    第一个大变革是从今年7月起人们就可以自己的意志来控制黄河三门峡上游发生的洪水了。在6月下旬，我们准备在泄水口里安起闸门，使下泄水量都由闸门来控制，勿使超过下游河床所能容许的安全度。如果黄河上游发生洪水，只要关闭一部分闸门，便可使下泄流量减少到六千秒立方米以下。如有必要还可多关闭一些闸门，使七天之内，下泄流量不超过一千秒立方米。因为关闭闸门而不能下泄的水量将全部收容在水库里。今后，再修建若干干支流水库，做好水土保持工作，黄河下游人民疾首痛心的历史性的黄河水灾就可一去不复返了。
    第二个大变革为今年之内三门峡大坝可以完成全部工程，在陕西、山西、河南间建造一个比太湖还要大的人造湖。三门峡大坝全部是用混凝土浇筑而成的。今后只要每月浇筑八、九万立方米的混凝土，大坝就可如期完成。三门峡工地上有着党委的坚强领导，许多苏联专家的无私帮助，全体工人干部干劲冲天，许多参加过解放战争的指战员身临前线，负责指挥，技术革命和技术革新运动风起云涌，加之专门为三门峡施工而设计和制造的机械化、自动化连续生产化等设备都已运用纯熟，发挥极大的威力。因此如期完成三门峡大坝工程我们是有充分信心的。
    以上发言是否有当，请代表们指正。
