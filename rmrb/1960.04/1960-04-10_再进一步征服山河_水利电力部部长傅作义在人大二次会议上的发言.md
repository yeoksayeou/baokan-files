Comrades Chairman, Deputies, and Committee Members:

    I warmly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Striving for the Early Realization of the National Agricultural Development Program." Now, I will only make a brief speech on water conservancy and electric power work.
    Last year, China's water conservancy and electric power undertakings, like other undertakings, achieved unprecedented continued great leaps forward on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958. Now, all the workers on the national water conservancy and electric power front are advancing courageously with the force of a thunderbolt and full of confidence to seize an even greater, better, and more comprehensive continued great leap forward in 1960.
    In terms of water conservancy construction: in 1959, thirty-one large reservoirs with a water storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters were completed nationwide, with a total water storage capacity of over 10 billion cubic meters. More than 1,000 medium-sized reservoirs were completed, and more than 1,200 irrigation areas of over 10,000 mu were completed. In addition, there were a large number of small-scale projects. A total of 13 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work was completed, the irrigated area was expanded by 70 million mu, preliminary soil and water conservation measures were implemented in an area of 80,000 square kilometers, the waterlogged area was initially treated in an area of 63 million mu, and mechanical irrigation and drainage were developed by 1.4 million horsepower. These projects, together with the projects built in the past nine years, played a huge role in overcoming last year's droughts and floods and ensuring the continued great leap forward in agricultural production.
    1959 was a year of very serious natural disasters in China. In terms of drought, during the three periods of summer when crops needed the most water, most parts of eight provinces and regions suffered severe drought, with an affected area of nearly 400 million mu. Relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes and the power of the water conservancy projects built over the years, under the leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, we achieved a major victory in the fight against drought, enabling most of the drought-affected farmland to get rid of the drought, and only some farmland suffered different degrees of disaster. In terms of floods, in 1959, the Pearl River Basin experienced a major flood. In the Dongjiang River Basin, the flood was equivalent to a once-in-a-century flood, and the water level in the lower reaches of the West and North Rivers was even higher than the maximum flood in history in 1915. After the heroic flood-fighting efforts of the people and the role played by the projects built over the years, we overcame the floods in the West and North Rivers. Only in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, because the Xin’fengjiang Reservoir under construction could not yet play a role in flood control, did a relatively serious disaster occur. Last year, the Haihe River Basin in North China experienced heavy rainstorms, with rainfall equivalent to that of 1949, and greater in the central areas of the rainstorm than in 1949 and 1939 before liberation. In 1939, the flood entered Tianjin City and lasted for a month. Last year, because the six large reservoirs, including Miyun, that were rushed to be built in the upper reaches of the Haihe River Basin all reached the flood control elevation, a total of 1.9 billion cubic meters of floodwater was retained, so that the floods of the Chaobai River, the Yongding River, the Shahe River, the Tanghe River, the Cihe River, and the Hutuo River, which are the southern branches of the Daqing River, did not exceed the capacity of the river channels. Only some areas suffered local disasters due to the excessive concentration of rainstorms.
    The focus of water conservancy work in 1960 is still on areas with dense populations, where the output of grain and cotton accounts for a large proportion of the total output of the country, and where the threat of floods and droughts is still very serious, in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Continuing to Carry Out Large-Scale Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Campaigns This Winter and Next Spring" issued by the Central Committee and the State Council in October 1959; secondly, it is on areas where the industrial population is relatively concentrated and grain cannot be self-sufficient, and areas in the middle reaches of the Yellow River where soil erosion is serious; ethnic minority areas and old revolutionary base areas should also be actively supported, and water conservancy work should be vigorously strengthened in commodity bases for agricultural products, so that these bases can take the lead in realizing water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. In order to achieve this requirement, since last winter, under the leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, a water conservancy construction upsurge with a more magnificent momentum, faster speed, and higher quality than the past two years has been set off nationwide. During this water conservancy campaign, the number of workers on water conservancy construction sites across the country reached a maximum of 77 million. Under the continued implementation of the "three main" policy of focusing on storage, small-scale projects, and self-management by the masses, a large number of large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects were launched in various places. This year, more than 200 large reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters have been started nationwide, including four reservoirs with a storage capacity of 5 billion to 10 billion cubic meters, and seven reservoirs with a water storage capacity of over 10 billion cubic meters. More than 1,400 medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of 10 million to 100 million cubic meters are being built, in addition to millions of small-scale projects. According to recent statistics, after the water conservancy upsurge last winter and this spring, the irrigated area expanded and improved nationwide has exceeded the planned 260 million mu. The area where preliminary soil and water conservation measures have been implemented is 140,000 square kilometers, accounting for 140% or 93% of the planned dozens to 150,000 square kilometers. More than 40 million mu of waterlogged area have been treated, accounting for 68% of the planned 60 million mu. A total of more than 27 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, which has exceeded the original planned task of 25 billion cubic meters. After this year's water conservancy upsurge and the projects built in the past, China's water conservancy landscape has undergone great changes, and the river basins have more complete water conservancy systems. The landscape of our great motherland has also been completely renewed as a result.
    Take the Yellow River as an example. This is a world-famous river that is difficult to manage. The ruling classes of past dynasties had no solution to it. Hundreds of millions of people on both sides of the Yellow River suffered deeply from its disasters. However, in the short span of ten years since liberation, this situation has been completely changed. Especially since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress in 1955 approved the "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Controlling the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy" made by Vice Premier Deng Zihui, the project of radically controlling and developing the Yellow River has been fully launched. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have been building a series of major projects on the main and tributary rivers of the Yellow River. The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub will be able to officially control floods during the flood season this year. The fierce Yellow River floods that have harmed people for thousands of years will be basically controlled from now on and will no longer rush downstream to harm the people. This has basically changed the original appearance of the Yellow River. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the hardworking and brave people of China finally tamed this river that had been difficult to tame for thousands of years in just a few years and forced it to serve China's socialist construction. This is indeed a great thing that deserves to be praised and cheered for thousands of years.
    In addition, the Huaihe River, Haihe River, Liaohe River, Hanjiang River, and the Dongjiang River, a tributary of the Pearl River, have also been renewed after several water conservancy upsurges since the Great Leap Forward. In the flood-prone Huaibei Plain, a great river network project has been launched, and Huaibei is being transformed into Jiangnan. The Chaobai River, Yongding River, southern branch of the Daqing River, Hutuo River, and Zhanghe River of the Haihe River Basin, as well as the Hunhe River and Qinghe River, tributaries of the Liaohe River, have been basically controlled. The Hanjiang River's Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub will partially control floods this year. The Xin’fengjiang Hydropower Station on the Dongjiang River, a tributary of the Pearl River, will control floods and generate electricity. This will play a huge role in overcoming floods and droughts in these areas and ensuring the continued great leap forward in agriculture.
    However, despite the brilliant achievements we have made in water conservancy construction, there is still a long way to go before we fully conquer and utilize the great goal of mountains and rivers. Although China's irrigated area has developed to 1.007 billion mu, some guarantee standards are still low. Although the Yellow River's floods have been basically controlled, the sediment problem has not been completely solved, and comprehensive development needs to be vigorously carried out. Other rivers also need to continue to be comprehensively managed and comprehensively developed in accordance with the needs of socialist construction. The preparatory work for the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River must be actively carried out. Therefore, we still have many greater and more arduous tasks to do. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report that we should "strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization and water conservancy throughout the country in about ten years, and realize a considerable degree of electrification." In order to achieve this great goal, we must continue to advance victoriously on the basis of this year's water conservancy movement, and strive to basically realize water conservancy in the vast majority of areas of the country in a few to ten years, requiring that the main areas of major rivers be able to defend against extra-large floods, and that more than 80% of the country's cultivated land be able to resist the largest droughts in local history. For more than 80% of the country's soil erosion area, we will strive to achieve terraced slopes, gully terraces, and greening of barren mountains and slopes in ten years or longer. After basically realizing water conservancy, water conservancy work will move towards the greater goal of conquering nature as required by communist construction.
    In terms of the electric power industry: the production and capital construction in 1959 greatly exceeded the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The national power generation reached 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51% over 1958, and we have successfully realized the glorious task of completing the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule as called for by the Party Central Committee. Last year, the newly added power generation equipment capacity was 3.2 million kilowatts, an increase of 78% over the newly added power generation equipment capacity in 1958, and 30% more than the total newly added power generation equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. More than 4,400 kilometers of new 110,000-volt and above high-voltage transmission lines were built, an increase of 51% over the new lines built in 1958; more than 2 million kilovolt-amperes of new 110,000-volt and above substation equipment capacity were built, an increase of 62% over the newly added capacity in 1958.
    The rapid development of the electric power industry has significantly changed China's position in the world in terms of power production level. In 1949, China's power generation ranked 25th in the world, in 1958 it jumped to 11th, and in 1959 it jumped to 9th. China's annual installed capacity of the electric power industry exceeded the same year's installed capacity of the United Kingdom by 26.5% in 1958 and 73.9% in 1959. According to the growth rate of power generation in China in the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, it can be asserted that it will definitely not take ten years to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom.
    In order to guarantee the electricity needs for the continued leap forward of the national economy, the 1960 plan is: the annual power generation is 55.5 billion kilowatt-hours to 58 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 34% to 40% over 1959. In order to support agriculture and rapidly realize rural electrification, the amount of electricity supplied to agriculture by the power grid this year (excluding the power generation of rural power stations) will increase by 233% compared with 1959. The annual installed capacity task is 4.2 million kilowatts (of which small foreign-made units below 6,000 kilowatts are about 390,000 kilowatts), an increase of 31% over the newly added equipment capacity in 1959; the installed capacity of rural hydropower stations is 200,000 kilowatts to 300,000 kilowatts, an increase of three to five times over the newly added capacity in 1959. The 7,700 kilometers of 110,000-volt and above high-voltage transmission lines and the 4.4 million kilovolt-amperes of substation equipment capacity increased by 73% and 118% respectively compared with the newly built transmission and transformation projects in 1959. According to this arrangement, there are a total of 192 project items above the quota this year, including 49 hydropower project items, 115 thermal power project items, and 28 transmission and transformation project items.
    Obviously, this is still a huge leap forward plan. In order to complete and overfulfill this year's planned tasks, so that capital construction can achieve rapid construction, early generation, early supply, high quality, high efficiency, saving, and safe and comprehensive leap forward; so that production work can achieve more generation, more supply, safety, and economic and comprehensive leap forward, the vast number of employees in the electric power industry system are carrying out a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Under the impetus of this movement, the appearance of enterprises is changing with each passing day, and production and construction are advancing rapidly. We have completed the power generation plan for the first quarter eight days ahead of schedule on March 23. Many units have achieved mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in many processes and production operations in just a few days or dozens of days, increasing labor productivity several times or dozens of times. This excellent situation in the electric power industry has created very favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling this year's leap forward plan. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, adhering to the general line and the policy of walking on two legs, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and promoting the communist spirit of cooperation, we will definitely be able to successfully realize the continued great leap forward in 1960.
    I have talked about the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy and electric power undertakings in 1959 and the current leap forward situation here. Now, I would like to talk about some of my personal feelings and experiences in this great era.
    The brilliant achievements that China's water conservancy and electric power undertakings have achieved in just a few years, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward, are really encouraging and exciting. Take the Yellow River as an example. This harmful river that has harmed the people for thousands of years and has not been developed and managed has been basically tamed by us in just a few years, making it benefit the people. It will no longer be a terrible river, but a very lovely river. In the old China, for thousands of years, the irrigated area in 1949 at the time of liberation was only 240 million mu, but after liberation, especially after the two water conservancy upsurges after the Great Leap Forward, it has now leapt to 1.007 billion mu. China's electric power industry's power generation has increased from 4.31 billion kilowatt-hours in 1949 to 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours in 1959, taking only ten years. The United Kingdom took thirty-three years from 4.6 billion kilowatt-hours in 1913 to 42.7 billion kilowatt-hours in 1946.
    When we announced the national economic indicators, the imperialists and reactionaries made nonsense, saying that it was impossible to achieve them. When we completed the indicators and the facts were in front of us, they were puzzled and uneasy. This is not surprising to them, because they have capitalist minds, they only know how to look at problems with money capital, and they don't understand anything else. The reason why we can develop at a high speed is because our socialist system has unparalleled superiority over the capitalist system. Our poverty-stricken and backward China's Great Leap Forward is even more because we have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, especially because we have Mao Zedong Thought that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. In every stage of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, Chairman Mao can timely and correctly put forward the line, principles, and tasks. Mao Zedong Thought can continuously and rationally resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. Mao Zedong Thought can mobilize all positive factors, give full play to people's subjective initiative, push the revolution from one victory to another, and constantly push China's socialist construction from one upsurge to another.
    In 1957, the right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the people. According to Chairman Mao's instructions on "correctly handling contradictions among the people," the Party launched a full-scale debate on the major issues of right and wrong between the two roads in the form of large-scale airing of views and writing big-character posters. As a result, the right-wing elements' attack was completely defeated, and more importantly, the political and ideological awareness of the people across the country was improved, and the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism was improved. On this basis, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao summarized the experience of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, concentrated the wishes of China's 650 million people, and timely put forward the "General Line for socialist construction: going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results" according to the law of development of China's socialist construction. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line, a major upsurge of water conservancy movement with "small-scale projects as the main focus, water storage as the main focus, and self-management by the masses as the main focus" appeared in water conservancy construction. Due to the improvement of socialist awareness, the irrigation area expanded in 1958 alone greatly exceeded the total irrigation area in the previous eight years. No one can say that this is not a Great Leap Forward. No one can say that this is not a victory of Mao Zedong Thought!
    With the continuous upsurge of production and construction and the rapid development of productive forces, the original relations of production of the cooperatives could no longer meet the requirements of the development of productive forces. Therefore, Chairman Mao concentrated the people's wishes and timely proposed the social grassroots organization of the people's commune. This people's commune, which is larger in scale, has a higher degree of public ownership, combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and combines government and communes, is the best grassroots organizational form for accelerating China's socialist construction and is the best organizational form for the transition from socialist society to communist society. Its characteristics of being large in scale and highly public-owned can rapidly change China's poor and backward appearance. In terms of water conservancy, with the people's commune, it can better organize labor and accelerate the speed of water conservancy construction; with the people's commune, it can uniformly mobilize labor, extensively carry out mountain and river management projects, and build large and medium-sized backbone projects on a large scale on the basis of small-scale projects as the main focus; with the people's commune, it can better solve the problem of water conservancy planning within a larger scope, and comprehensively plan and arrange water conservancy facilities according to the natural conditions suitable for agriculture, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, navigation, and aquaculture, and link the previously scattered and isolated water conservancy projects with each other to form a relatively powerful water conservancy system, unified management, and rational dispatch. Due to the establishment of people's communes, after two water conservancy upsurges, taking the Haihe River Basin as an example, only Guanting Reservoir was built in the past nine years, which was a larger workload reservoir project. In 1959 alone, due to the unified mobilization of labor, six large reservoirs including Miyun were built to the flood control elevation. This had an unimaginable effect on preventing the extraordinary flood of the Haihe River that year. These two upsurges built more than 40 large reservoirs, more than three times the number in the previous eight years after liberation. Can this be said not to be a Great Leap Forward! Can this be said not to be a victory of Mao Zedong Thought!
    The Party's general line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies are the embodiment of Chairman Mao's mass line thought and are a model of Chairman Mao's creative application of Marxism-Leninism in China's socialist construction. This policy mobilized all the forces of the country, gave play to all the potential that could be given play, so that China's industry, agriculture, heavy industry, and light industry all achieved both high-speed and proportional development, greatly accelerating the process of China's social development. At the same time, it also greatly changed the unreasonable situation of China's industrial distribution. Taking the electric power industry as an example, after the decentralization of enterprises and undertakings in the electric power industry, relying on everyone's efforts, in just two years, every province, city (region) has established a professional team that can independently design and independently construct from scratch. Most cities and counties can independently install units of 3,000 to 5,000 kilowatts. Now, all major and medium-sized cities and some cities and counties and many rural areas across the country have power plants of different scales. The original very weak northwest region has increased its power generation capacity by forty times, and the southwest and central China regions have increased by ten times. The Tibet region, which originally had no power stations, now has both hydropower and thermal power plants. The unreasonable layout of China's electric power industry, which was originally concentrated in the northeast and major coastal cities, has undergone significant changes. This huge change has major political and economic significance. By 1959, the power generation equipment capacity of the whole country had leapt from 1.85 million kilowatts in 1949 to over 9.4 million kilowatts. The power generation equipment capacity increased in the two years of the Great Leap Forward was almost equal to twice that of the previous eight years. Can this be said not to be a Great Leap Forward!
    For the vast majority of the people across the country, running electricity was still out of reach two years ago. After the Great Leap Forward, a national electricity generation campaign was launched. The broad masses of the people liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and running electricity was no longer something that only the electric power department could do. Factories can do it, street residents can do it, and the vast rural areas can do it. They ran out of native methods and also ran out of foreign methods. They can design, install, and manufacture. Last year, the rural areas of Henan Province alone built 120,000 kilowatts of electricity and power in one year. By the end of January this year, Xuchang Prefecture had achieved that every commune had a power station. The beautiful picture of rural electrification in China has already been displayed in front of us.
    Last year, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning, encourage hard work, and carry out mass campaigns to increase production and practice economy, a magnificent production upsurge was quickly set off across the country, with a high degree of communist awareness and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, realizing the continued great leap forward in 1959. This year, a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been launched throughout the country, which fully proves that adhering to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes can build socialism at a high speed. This fact makes me deeply realize the great role of the Party's leadership and the great role of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Now, technical innovation and technical revolution have swept the country. This great mass movement with historical significance, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said, is the inevitable result of the continuous economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, and cultural revolution, and is the inevitable product of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the water conservancy and electric power construction front has gradually developed from general improvement of operations and improvement of tools to large-scale mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. From single technical innovations, it has developed into complete sets of technical innovations; from technical innovations in one department and one industry, it has developed into large-scale cooperation between departments and industries, and many exciting things have emerged. For example, the cooperation between power supply and power consumption created in Harbin is a fundamental and major initiative that has changed the separate power supply mode of one factory and one household, greatly improved labor productivity, and saved a lot of equipment and materials. It has not only found a new way to reform the existing power distribution system, but also pointed out a new direction for future construction. This is a product of communist thought under the socialist system.
    As this movement continues to develop deeply, we can say with complete certainty that the production and construction tasks assigned to us by the state this year will be greatly overfulfilled.
    All these great victories are the victories of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victories of mass movements under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: The people, only the people, are the real creators of history. Relying on the masses and following the mass line, we can be invincible, overcome all difficulties, and move forward continuously.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, under the superior socialist system, the Chinese people who have become masters of their own country and participate in enterprise management will have a conscious, voluntary, and unparalleled labor enthusiasm and unlimited creativity. This is the source of power for the Great Leap Forward and continuous leaps forward. This is precisely what the imperialists and reactionaries can never do and can never learn. Let the imperialists and reactionaries be puzzled and uneasy. We must follow Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution and continue to leap forward and continuously leap forward. As long as we earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, always follow Chairman Mao, and always follow the Chinese Communist Party, our cause can continuously move from one upsurge to a higher upsurge, and continuously move from one victory to another greater victory.

专栏：

    再进一步征服山河
    水利电力部部长傅作义在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我热烈地拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告。现在，我仅就水利电力工作作个扼要的发言。
    去年，我国的水利电力事业同其他事业一样，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又实现了前所未有的继续大跃进。现在，全国水利电力战线上的全体职工，正以雷霆万钧之势，信心百倍地为夺取1960年的更大、更好、更全面的继续大跃进而奋勇前进。
    在水利建设方面：1959年，全国共建成蓄水一亿立方米以上的大型水库三十一座，共可蓄水一百多亿立方米，建成中型水库一千多座，万亩以上的灌区一千二百多座，另外，还有大量的小型工程。共计完成土石方一百三十亿立方米，扩大灌溉面积七千万亩，初步实施水土保持措施面积八万平方公里，初步治理洼涝面积六千三百万亩，发展机械排灌一百四十万马力。通过这些工程和过去九年来已修的工程，对战胜去年的水旱灾害，保证农业生产的继续大跃进起了巨大作用。
    1959年，是我国自然灾害非常严重的一年。在旱灾方面，当作物需要水最多的三伏时期，有八个省区的大部分地方，遭受了严重的干旱，受旱面积近四亿亩。我们依靠了人民公社的强大力量，依靠历年来兴修的水利工程的威力，在各级党委和人民政府的领导下，取得了抗旱斗争的重大胜利，使受旱地区中大部分农田摆脱了干旱，只有部分农田遭到了程度不同的灾害。在水灾方面，1959年珠江流域曾发生了大洪水，在东江流域相当于百年一遇的洪水，西、北江下游水位比历史上最大洪水的1915年还高，经过人民英勇的防汛斗争和历年来兴修的工程发挥了作用，我们战胜了西、北江的洪水，只有在东江下游地区因为正在修建的新丰江水库尚不能发挥拦洪作用，发生了比较严重的灾害。去年，华北海河流域发生了很大的暴雨，雨量相当于1949年，在暴雨中心地区还大于1949年和解放以前的1939年。1939年洪水曾经入天津市，持续达一个月，而去年，由于在海河流域上抢修的密云等六座大型水库都达到了拦洪高程，共拦蓄洪水十九亿立方米，使潮白河、永定河、大清河南支的沙河、唐河、磁河以及滹沱河等河流的洪水都没有超过河道容量。只有部分地区由于暴雨过于集中，造成局部地区的灾害。
    1960年度的水利工作，根据中央和国务院在1959年10月发布的“关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示”精神，工作重点仍然放在人口稠密、粮棉产量占全国总产量比重较大，而水旱灾害威胁仍很严重的地区；其次是工业人口比较集中，粮食不能自给的地区，和水土流失严重的黄河中游地区；对少数民族地区和革命老根据地也应该积极支持，对农产品的商品基地，应该大力加强水利工作，使这些基地先走一步，实现水利化、机械化和电气化。为实现这一要求，从去年冬天起，在各级党委和人民政府的领导下，在全国范围内，掀起了一个比过去两年气势更磅礴、速度更快、质量更高的水利建设高潮。在这次水利运动中，全国水利工地上的工人数最多时曾经达到七千七百万人，各地在继续贯彻以蓄为主、小型为主、群众自办为主的“三主”方针下，大量举办了大、中、小型水利工程。全国今年续建和新建库容在一亿立方米以上的大型水库已经开工的有二百多座，其中库容五十亿到一百亿立方米的水库有四座，蓄水一百亿立方米以上的水库有七座。修建库容在一千万至一亿立方米的中型水库有一千四百多座，另外，还有数百万处小型工程。根据最近的统计，经过去冬今春的水利高潮，全国扩大和改善的灌溉面积，已经超额完成了二亿六千万亩的计划。初步实施水土保持措施面积十四万平方公里，占计划数十至十五万平方公里的140％或93％。完成治涝面积四千多万亩，为计划六千万亩的68％。共计完成了土石方二百七十多亿立方米，已经超额完成了原定二百五十亿立方米的计划任务。经过今年的水利高潮和过去所修的工程，我国的水利面貌已经有了很大改变，各个江河流域有了更加完整的水利系统，我们伟大祖国的山河面貌也因之焕然一新。
    拿黄河来说，这是一条世界著名的难以治理的河流，历代统治阶级都对它毫无办法，黄河两岸的亿万人民受尽了它的深重灾难，可是在解放后的短短十年间，这个情况就完全改变了。特别自1955年第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，批准了邓子恢副总理所作的“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”以后，根治和开发黄河的工程就已经全面展开。大跃进以来，我们在黄河干支流上正在修建着一系列的重大工程，三门峡水利枢纽，今年汛期就可以正式拦洪，为害几千年的凶猛的黄河洪水，从此基本得到控制，不能再到下游横冲直撞为害人民了，这使黄河基本上改变了原来的面貌。我国勤劳勇敢的人民，终于在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，用短短几年的时间，驯服了这条几千年来难以驯服的河流，并且迫使它为我国的社会主义建设服务，这确是值得千载万代歌颂欢呼的一件大事情。
    另外，淮河、海河、辽河、汉江和珠江支流东江等流域，经过大跃进以来的几次水利高潮，也已经面貌一新。在易涝的淮北平原，开展了伟大的河网化工程，正在把淮北变成江南。海河流域的潮白河、永定河、大清河南支、滹沱河以及漳河等河流和辽河支流浑河、清河等河流已经基本上得到了控制；汉江由于丹江口水利枢纽的今年部分拦洪；珠江支流东江由于新丰江水电站的拦洪发电，这对战胜这些地区的水旱灾害和保证农业继续大跃进，都起着巨大的作用。
    但是，尽管我们在水利建设上获得了这样辉煌的成就，而离我们完全征服和利用山河的伟大目标还有很长距离。我国的灌溉面积虽然已经发展到了十亿零七千万亩，但是有的保证标准还较低，黄河的洪水虽然基本上得到了控制，但泥沙问题还没有完全解决，而综合开发还需要大力进行，其他河流随着社会主义建设的需要，也还需要继续进行全面治理和综合开发，长江三峡的准备工作更要积极的进行。因此，我们还有许多更伟大更艰巨的工作要作。李富春副总理报告中指出要“在十年左右的时间，争取在全国范围内基本上实现农业机械化和水利化，并且实现相当程度的电气化”。为实现这个伟大的目标，就须要在今年水利运动的基础上继续乘胜前进，力争在几年到十年内在全国绝大多数地区基本实现水利化，要求各大江河的主要地区都能够防御特大洪水，全国80％以上的耕地，都能够抗御当地历史上的最大旱灾。全国水土流失面积的80％以上，争取十年或者更长一点的时间，作到坡地梯田化，沟壑川台化，荒山荒坡绿化。在基本实现水利化以后，水利工作将随着共产主义建设的需要迈向征服大自然更伟大的目标。
    在电力工业方面：1959年的生产和基本建设，都大大超过了大跃进的1958年。全国发电量达到四百一十五亿度，比1958年增长了51％，已经胜利地实现了党中央号召我们提前三年完成第二个五年计划指标的光荣任务。去年，新增加的发电设备容量为三百二十万瓩，比1958年新增发电设备容量增长了78％，比第一个五年计划期间，全部新增发电设备容量还多30％。新建十一万伏以上的高压输电线路四千四百多公里，比1958年新建线路增长了51％；新建十一万伏以上变电设备容量二百多万千伏安，比1958年新增容量增长了62％。
    电力工业的飞跃发展，使我国电力生产水平在世界上所处的地位，发生了显著的变化。1949年我国的发电量居世界第二十五位，1958年跃居第十一位，1959年就跃居第九位。我国电力工业的年装机容量，在1958年就超过了英国同年装机容量的26.5％，1959年超过了73.9％。按照我国十年来特别是大跃进以来发电量的增长速度来看，可以断言，绝不需要十年就可以赶上或超过英国。
    为了保证国民经济继续跃进的用电需要，1960年计划：年发电量为五百五十五亿度到五百八十亿度，比1959年增长34％到40％。为了支援农业，迅速地实现农村电气化，今年由电网供给农业的用电量（不包括农村电站的发电量），将比1959年增长233％。年装机任务为四百二十万瓩（其中六千瓩以下的小洋群机组约三十九万瓩），比1959年新增设备容量增长31％；农村水电站装机为二十万瓩到三十万瓩，比1959年新增容量增长三倍到五倍。十一万伏以上高压输电线路七千七百公里和变电设备容量四百四十万千伏安，分别比1959年新建的输变电工程增长73％和118％。按照这个安排，今年限额以上的工程项目共一百九十二个，其中水电工程项目四十九个，火电一百一十五个，输变电工程二十八个。
    显然，这仍然是一个巨大的跃进计划。为了完成和超额完成今年的计划任务，使基本建设作到快建、早发、早供、优质、高效、节约、安全全面跃进；使生产工作作到多发、多供、安全、经济全面跃进，电力工业系统中的广大职工，正在开展着以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。在这个运动的推动下，企业面貌日新月异，生产建设一日千里。我们已在3月23日，提前八天完成了第一季度的发电量计划。许多单位在短短几天或几十天内，就在很多工序上和生产操作中实现了机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，几倍、几十倍地提高了劳动生产率。电力工业的这种大好形势，为完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，创造了十分有利条件。我们相信在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，坚持总路线和两条腿走路的方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大兴共产主义协作之风，我们一定能够胜利地实现1960年的继续大跃进。
    对1959年水利电力事业的大跃进和目前的跃进形势，我就讲到这里。现在，我想谈谈我个人在这个伟大年代里的一些感受和体会。
    我国的水利电力事业在短短的几年里，特别是在大跃进的两年里，所获得的辉煌成就，实在是令人鼓舞兴奋的。拿黄河来说，这条过去几千年来为害人民，一直没有得到开发和治理的害河，我们仅用了几年的时间，就把它基本驯服了，使它造福于人民。它将再不是一个可怕的河流，而变成一个很可爱的河流。旧中国几千年来，到解放时的1949年的灌溉面积只有二亿四千万亩，而解放后，特别是经过了大跃进后的两次水利高潮，现在已经跃进为十亿零七千万亩。我国电力工业的发电量，从1949年的四十三点一亿度达到1959年的四百一十五亿度，仅用了十年时间。而英国从1913年的四十六亿度到1946年的四百二十七亿度，却用了三十三年的时间。
    帝国主义和反动派，当我们公布国民经济指标的时候，他们就胡言乱语，说什么不可能达到，当我们完成指标，事实摆在面前的时候，他们又迷惑不解，惶恐不安了。这也难怪他们，因为他们是资本主义的脑子，他们只知道拿金钱资本看问题，别的就什么不懂了。我们所以能够高速度的发展，是因为我们的社会主义制度，有着为资本主义制度所不可比拟的优越性。我们一穷二白的中国的大跃进，则更是因为我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，特别是我们有把马列主义普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想。在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个阶段中，毛主席能不早、不迟、适时地、正确地提出路线、方针和任务。毛泽东思想，能不断地、合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，毛泽东思想，能够调动一切积极因素，把人的主观能动性充分发挥出来，把革命由一个胜利推向另一个胜利，把我国的社会主义建设不断地由一个高潮推向另一个高潮。
    1957年，右派分子向党向人民发动了猖狂的进攻，党根据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”的指示，用大鸣大放、大字报的形式，发动全民进行了两条道路的大是大非的大辩论。结果彻底打垮了右派的进攻，更重要的是提高了全国人民的政治思想觉悟，提高了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性。在这个基础上，党中央和毛主席总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设经验，集中了我国六亿五千万人民的意愿，根据我国社会主义建设的发展规律，及时地提出了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线”。在总路线的光辉照耀下，水利建设方面就出现了一个以
  “小型为主、蓄水为主、群众自办为主”的水利运动大高潮。由于社会主义觉悟的提高，1958年一年扩大的灌溉面积，大大超过了前八年灌溉面积的总和。谁也不能说这不是个大跃进。谁也不能说这不是毛泽东思想的胜利！
    随着生产建设的不断高涨以及生产力的迅速发展，原来的合作社的生产关系已不能适应生产力发展的要求，因此，毛主席集中了人民意愿，及时地提出人民公社的社会基层组织，这种规模更大、公有程度更高、工农商学兵相结合、政社合一的人民公社是加快我国社会主义建设的最好的基层组织形式，是由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的组织形式。它的一大二公的特点，能够迅速地改变我国的一穷二白的面貌。就水利来说，有了人民公社，就能更好地组织劳力，加快水利建设的速度；有了人民公社，就能统一调动劳动力，广泛进行治山治水工程，并且在以小型为主的基础上，大量兴修大中型骨干工程；有了人民公社，就能在更大的范围内，更好地解决水利规划问题，根据宜农、宜工、宜林、宜牧、宜航运、宜水产的自然条件，全面规划和布置水利设施，将过去分散孤立的水利工程，互相联结，组成比较强大的水利系统，统一管理，合理调度。由于人民公社的建立，经过两个水利高潮，就海河流域说，过去九年，工作量较大的水库工程，只修了一座官厅水库，1959年一年由于劳力的统一调动，使密云等六座大型水库都修到拦洪高程。这对于防止海河当年的特大洪水，起了想像不到的效果。这两个高潮共修大型水库四十多座，为解放后前八年的三倍多，这能说这不是个大跃进吗！这能说这不是毛泽东思想的胜利吗？
    党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，是毛主席的群众路线的思想的体现，是毛主席在我国社会主义建设中，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的典范。这个方针，调动了举国上下的一切力量，发挥了一切可以发挥的潜力，使我国的工业、农业、重工业、轻工业都获得既高速度又按比例地发展，大大地加速了我国社会发展的进程。同时，也大大地改变了我国工业分布的不合理状况。拿电力工业来说，电力工业在企业、事业下放以后，依靠大家动手，仅仅在两年的时间里，每个省市（区）都从无到有地建立了可以独立设计和独立施工的专业队伍，大部分市、县都可以独立安装三、五千瓩的机组。现在，全国各大中城市和部分市、县以及不少农村，都有了规模不同的发电厂，原来基础十分薄弱的西北地区，发电容量增加了四十倍，西南、华中地区均增加了十倍，原来没有电站的西藏地区，现在水、火电厂都有了。我国电力工业原来偏集于东北及沿海各大城市的不合理布局，有了显著的改变。这个巨大的变化具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。到1959年，全国的发电设备容量已由1949年的一百八十五万瓩，跃进到九百四十万瓩以上，两年跃进所增加的发电设备容量，几乎等于前八年的两倍，这能说这不是个大跃进吗！
    办电，对全国广大人民群众来说，两年前还是高不可攀的。大跃进以后，开展了全民办电运动，广大群众解放了思想，破除了迷信，办电，就不再只是电力部门能办了，工厂可以办，街道居民可以办，广大农村可以办；办出了土的，也办出了洋的，能设计，能安装，也能制造。去年河南省的农村一年就办起电力、动力十二万瓩。许昌专区，到今年1月底已经做到社社有电站。我国农村电气化的美好图景，已经展现在我们的面前。
    去年，全国人民在党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲，开展群众性的增产节约运动的伟大号召后，很快地掀起了波澜壮阔的生产高潮，以高度的共产主义觉悟和冲天的革命干劲，实现了1959年的继续大跃进。今年又在全国范围内掀起了规模浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动，这充分地证明了坚持总路线，大跃进，人民公社，就能高速度地建设社会主义。这个事实，使我深深地体会到党的领导的伟大作用，毛泽东思想的伟大作用。
    现在，技术革新和技术革命，已经席卷全国。这个有历史意义的伟大群众运动，正像李富春副总理所讲的，是不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命的必然结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物。水利电力建设战线上技术革新和技术革命运动，已经从一般地改进操作、改进工具，逐步发展到大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。从单项的技术革新，发展成为成套的技术革新；从一个部门、一个行业的技术革新，发展成为部门之间、行业之间的大协作，出现了许多令人兴奋的事情。比如，哈尔滨创造的供用电合作化，是一个带有根本性的重大创举，改变了历来一厂、一户的单独供电方式，大大提高了劳动生产率，节省了大量的设备和器材，不仅为改革现有配电系统找到了新的途径，同时也为今后的建设指出了新的方向。这是在社会主义制度下，共产主义思想的产物。
    这个运动持续地、深入地发展下去，我们完全可以肯定地说今年国家交给我们的生产和建设任务，必将大大地超额完成。
    这一切伟大的胜利，都是中国共产党领导的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是在毛泽东思想领导下，大搞群众运动的胜利。毛主席说：人民，只有人民，才是历史的真正创造者。依靠群众、走群众路线，我们就能战无不胜，攻无不克，不断前进。
    在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义的优越制度下，当了家，作了主的中国，参加了事业管理的工农群众，就会有着自觉自愿不可比拟的劳动积极性，有着不可限量的创造性，这是大跃进，不断跃进的力量的源泉，这正是帝国主义和反动派永远办不到，永远学不到的。让帝国主义和反动派去迷惑不解，惶恐不安吧。我们一定要遵循毛主席不断革命的思想，继续跃进，不断地跃进。只要我们认真地学习毛泽东思想，永远跟着毛主席走，永远跟着中国共产党走，我们的事业就能不断地由一个高潮走向更高的高潮，不断地从一个胜利走向另一个更大的胜利。
