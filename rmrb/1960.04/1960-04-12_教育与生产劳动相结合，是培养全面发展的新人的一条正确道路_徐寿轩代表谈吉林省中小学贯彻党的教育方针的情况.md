Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the Draft 1960 National Budget," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Now, I would like to share some information on how our province's primary and secondary schools are implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Please offer your criticism and corrections.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, Jilin Province's education front, like the rest of the country, launched a great educational revolution centered on the combination of education and productive labor in 1958, achieving tremendous accomplishments. After rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, the political and ideological awareness of the vast number of teachers and students has significantly improved. After studying the educational policy proposed by Chairman Mao of "cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," the errors of education being detached from politics, production, and reality were criticized, and the goals of cultivation were clarified. Middle and primary schools in various regions began to attach importance to organizing students to participate in productive labor. In the winter of 1957, a vigorous work-study movement emerged throughout the province, and by the spring of 1958, it had formed a climax. The movement developed exceptionally rapidly, with great momentum. The vast number of teachers and students competed to participate in various industrial and agricultural production and social welfare labor, the face of the schools was greatly changed, and the social atmosphere was also positively influenced. Around the summer vacation of that year, we promptly summarized the experience of the work-study movement, criticized Right-leaning conservative thinking in the work-study program, and launched a new upsurge of schools running factories throughout the province, pushing the work-study program to a new stage. After the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Educational Work," educational workers throughout the province conscientiously studied and implemented the Party's educational policy, further recognized the great significance of combining education with productive labor, and school production labor achieved new development. At the same time, the vast number of teachers and students participated in the great mass movements of steelmaking, iron smelting, autumn harvesting, and autumn plowing, not only supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production but also receiving an extremely meaningful exercise. In February 1959, according to the spirit of the Central Education Conference, teaching, productive labor, and student life were comprehensively arranged, production avenues were adjusted, the internal production labor bases of the schools were consolidated and developed, productive labor was listed as a formal course, and the systematization and regularization of labor were realized. Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch an increase production and practice economy campaign, the production labor of middle and primary schools throughout the province has achieved new development on the basis of the past. Now, production is gradually stabilizing, equipment is becoming increasingly enriched, operation and management are constantly improving, organizational leadership is becoming more sound, the combination of education and productive labor is becoming closer, and it has embarked on a new stage of consolidation, improvement, and healthy development.

At present, middle and primary schools in our province, whether in urban or rural areas, whether state-run or run by factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, people's communes, or urban street offices, whether full-time or part-time, have universally established production labor bases. The bases of the vast majority of schools are basically sufficient and maintain regular production. According to statistics from 362 ordinary middle schools, there are a total of 1,025 factories for machinery, electrical engineering, metal and woodworking, and chemical industry, with 337 various metal cutting machine tools, cultivating more than 2,400 hectares of land, raising more than 8,000 pigs, and raising more than 67,000 chickens. Primary schools in various regions have also established production bases suitable for the age characteristics of children. According to statistics from 7,328 primary schools, there are a total of 4,646 small factories for hardware, woodworking, paper products, stationery, toys, sewing, and weaving, and 7,825 hectares of agricultural gardens. More than 18,000 pigs and more than 90,000 chickens are raised.

Due to the combination of education and productive labor, the quality of education has significantly improved, and students' moral, intellectual, and physical development has been comprehensively developed.

In labor practice and in contact with workers and peasants, students have received education in class viewpoints, labor viewpoints, mass viewpoints, collective viewpoints, and dialectical materialism viewpoints, and their mental outlook and ideological feelings have undergone profound changes. In the past, some students hated labor and were afraid of getting dirty, tired, and losing face; now, they compete to do the work, recognizing the glory and great significance of labor. Some middle school students wrote in their compositions: "When I walk to the woodworking factory, the fragrance of wood shavings wafts from afar; when I leave the woodworking factory, it is like an infant leaving its mother," expressing a strong interest in labor. In working with workers, students are deeply infected by the selfless and dedicated noble qualities of the working class, their collectivist thinking and sense of organization and discipline are enhanced, and conscientious reading and diligent study have become the norm. Through going to factories and the countryside, participating in labor, and visiting people's communes, students have deeply experienced the dazzling brilliance and unparalleled power of the three magic weapons of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, and they more intimately feel the wisdom and greatness of the Party's leadership, greatly improving their socialist ideological consciousness. Therefore, they enthusiastically sing: "The Party's educational policy shines brightly, illuminating our hearts, determined to be laborers who are both literate and martial, forever advancing on the road of being both red and expert."

Through labor, theory is combined with practice, students' horizons are broadened, and they acquire perceptual knowledge, so they understand the knowledge learned in the classroom quickly and remember it firmly. Some courses do not require as much teaching time as before to learn; at the same time, some textbooks are exposed as being detached from reality and the teaching content is already outdated. This creates conditions for improving the quality of teaching in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and also raises a series of questions for us to continue to deepen the educational revolution and reform the curriculum and teaching content. Labor practice also enriches students' lives. In their compositions, the content of singing the praises of the Party, the laboring people, and labor has increased, and the ideological nature has been strengthened. The quality of students' knowledge has significantly improved. Last year, the examination results of high school graduates in Jilin Province who applied to colleges and universities were greatly improved compared with the past. Taking the entrance examination results of graduates from 13 junior high schools in Changchun City as an example, the overall average in 1959 was 60.9 points, an increase of 5.1 points compared to 1957 before the educational revolution. While improving the quality of knowledge, students' bodies have also received good exercise, diseases have been greatly reduced, and physical strength has been further enhanced.

After participating in labor, students have acquired a lot of industrial and agricultural production knowledge and skills. Among more than 1,100 students in Jilin Provincial Experimental Middle School, 350 have learned production technologies such as lathe work, fitter work, and forging, more than 250 have learned to repair and assemble radios and teleconference machines, more than 300 have learned simple construction and carpentry techniques, and more than 200 have learned to manufacture pesticides and indigenous fertilizers. All students in the school have also learned to varying degrees knowledge and skills such as cultivating land, fertilizing, sowing, weeding, irrigating, harvesting, and raising livestock. This forms a stark contrast to the situation in the past where most urban students "do not use their four limbs and cannot distinguish the five grains." "Put down the books and enter the factory, take off the work clothes and return to the classroom, the heart is forged as red as fire, and the knowledge learned is like the ocean," students enthusiastically sing about their learning and labor life.

Not only that, but students' participation in productive labor has also created a large amount of wealth for the country. The total value of production in middle schools throughout the province in 1959 was 13.78 million yuan, an average of 38,000 yuan per school. The quantity of industrial products is large and the types are diverse. Middle school students throughout the province produced more than 1,640 tons of various mechanical parts, 3,323 teleconference machines, more than 9,800 tons of fertilizers and pesticides, 13.18 million bricks for construction, more than 60,000 pieces of wooden furniture, and 135,000 feet of woven cloth. Middle and primary schools throughout the province produced a total of more than 23 million jin of grain, more than 30 million jin of cash crops, and more than 77 million jin of vegetables. In addition to self-use, vegetables are also supplied to the market in large quantities. Middle and primary schools collected a total of 1.19 million jin of medicinal materials, mountain fruits, and tree seeds, and 67.7 million jin of firewood and grass. Teachers and students also participated in social welfare labor, supporting the country's various construction undertakings and the agricultural production of people's communes for a total of 7.8 million workdays without remuneration throughout the year. All of this not only played an active role in supporting the country's socialist construction in industry and agriculture and meeting the needs of the people's lives, but also increased the income of schools, creating material conditions for expanding reproduction, solving student welfare, and subsidizing some students in difficulty.

Facts have proved that the combination of education and productive labor is beneficial to students' moral, intellectual, and physical development, and it is indeed a correct path to cultivating well-rounded individuals. The view that students' participation in productive labor will reduce the quality of education is unfounded and completely wrong.

The implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor has fundamentally reversed the situation in which school education is detached from politics, production, and reality, ended the history of thousands of years of separation between education and productive labor, opened a new era in the history of education in our country, and enabled our country's education to better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and serve the realization of communist society. This is the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction in the field of education, the victory of the Party's educational policy, and the victory of Chairman Mao's educational thought.

We have the following experiences in implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor and carrying out productive labor in primary and secondary schools in Jilin Province:

First, the implementation of the combination of education and productive labor is an extremely profound revolution on the education front. We must rely on the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command in order to correctly implement the Party's educational policy, destroy bourgeois educational thought and establish proletarian educational thought, and destroy bourgeois educational systems and establish proletarian educational systems. This process of destruction and establishment is a serious process of class struggle. The work-study program immediately attracted the attention of the vast number of teachers and students and society as a whole, and became the center of public opinion for a time. The majority of people enthusiastically supported it; some people hesitated and waited to see; and a small number of bourgeois elements and people who were deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie rose up to attack it, saying that "the work-study program affects learning and affects health." Standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, they adhered to the erroneous view that "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," and opposed the combination of education and productive labor. Thus, a sharp struggle unfolded on the issue of whether or not to have a work-study program. Around the summer vacation of 1959, when further emphasis was placed on full-time schools focusing on teaching and strengthening basic course teaching, some people took the opportunity to spread the erroneous argument that "improving the quality of teaching requires reducing labor," attempting to sacrifice productive labor in exchange for the "improvement" of teaching quality, and to pull the schools back to the old road of the bourgeoisie. Under the leadership of the Party, we carried out a struggle between two roads and two ideologies. On the one hand, we organized all teachers, students, cadres, and the masses to carry out a great debate on educational policy, raise awareness, and criticize bourgeois educational thought; on the other hand, we cultivated typical examples, established banners, and summarized experiences, using vivid and powerful facts to educate the masses. Party committees at all levels are extremely concerned about and attach great importance to the educational revolution carried out by the schools, promptly pointing out the direction, solving major key issues, and taking effective measures to encourage the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of teachers and students, so that the educational revolution can be deepened step by step and continue to develop. We deeply feel that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee of all victories. The achievements we have made are inseparable from the leadership of the Party.

Second, establish internal production labor bases in schools, and adhere to the principle of focusing on internal and combining internal and external. Establishing sufficient and maintaining regular production labor bases in schools is the material foundation for realizing the combination of education and productive labor. What form should be adopted to establish production labor bases? According to the conditions in our province, after two years of practice, we feel that the best form is for schools to run their own factories, farms, and breeding farms. If one school can run it, then one school will run it; if one school cannot run it, then several schools will jointly run it.

There are many benefits to establishing internal production labor bases in schools: fixed labor sites make labor easy to regularize and systematize; schools can actively arrange teaching and labor; labor can be allocated according to the different characteristics of students; it is easy to achieve diversification, which is convenient for combining with teaching.

Schools face certain difficulties in terms of funds, equipment, raw materials, and technical strength when establishing their own labor bases. Thanks to the attention of Party committees and governments at all levels, the support of all parties, and the efforts of all teachers and students, schools in various regions of our province have basically solved these problems by adopting the following methods: (1) using existing old machines and simple equipment to gradually enrich and expand the factories; (2) seeking social support; (3) incorporating them into local production plans, or processing for external units, with relevant departments helping to solve problems such as funds, equipment, and supply and marketing; (4) local education and finance departments temporarily lending funds; (5) allocating small factories suitable for school operation to schools; (6) schools with a good foundation helping schools with poor conditions or newly built schools; (7) adopting a combination of "inviting experts to guide," "sending people out to learn," and teachers and students researching themselves and equipping them with fixed technical workers to solve technical strength. In addition, there are also forms such as joint school-run factories and factory-school cooperation, and factories establishing workshops on campus.

In order to enable students to have more opportunities to contact workers and peasants, contact large-scale production, and contact social reality, schools in various regions have, in addition to establishing certain production bases on campus according to conditions, also linked up with factories, mines, and people's communes to organize students to go to factories and the countryside for labor, combining internal labor with external labor.

In addition to establishing the above-mentioned production labor bases, we have also arranged social welfare labor according to the instructions of the central government. During the busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvesting, schools actively organize students to participate in these labor activities as required. Students' participation in social welfare labor not only supports industrial and agricultural production and construction, but also enables them to receive profound education and understand the central tasks of the Party, closely linking themselves with the country's construction cause.

Third, schools should establish production labor bases, starting from actual conditions and adapting to local conditions. Jilin Province has vast land and abundant resources, with plains, mountainous areas, semi-mountainous areas, and grasslands. Schools in various regions have determined different production projects according to the characteristics of different regions. The focus of urban schools is on industry, and in places where conditions permit, they also actively operate some farmland, grow vegetables, and engage in breeding. The focus of rural schools is on agriculture, combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production, developing diversified operations, and in places where conditions permit, they also actively run factories that serve agriculture. Mountainous schools, in addition to operating industry and agriculture, also engage in special products. Schools in the Tonghua area have engaged in "three factories (farms), three gardens, and one collection." "Three factories (farms)" are factories, farms, and breeding farms; "three gardens" are orchards, medicinal gardens, and vegetable gardens; and "one collection" is collecting medicinal materials, mountain fruits, and tree seeds. In addition to operating agriculture, grassland areas have also developed animal husbandry, established large-scale salt, alkali, and saltpeter factories and small chemical factories, and engaged in large-scale sideline occupations such as harvesting grass, reeds, and weaving.

Fourth, in the process of establishing production labor bases, schools in various regions have adhered to the principle of starting from scratch, making do with whatever is available, starting from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Two years of practice have proved that this is the only way to establish school production labor bases in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and it is a law of development. Production bases have been established quickly by those who follow this principle. However, this law was not immediately accepted by people, and there have been struggles in the work. Some people lack enthusiasm, emphasize difficulties, and hold the attitude of not doing it if the superior does not support it, and not doing it if it is not included in the national plan. They do not actively overcome difficulties that can be overcome. Facts have proved that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party and boldly mobilize the masses, many problems can be solved. The school's production should be gradually incorporated into the national plan, but some of the production projects of primary and secondary schools cannot be included in the plan from the beginning. Only when there is a foundation and production is done well can they be gradually incorporated into the plan. If we wait until it is included in the plan before doing it, it will not be possible to do it. Some schools also want to reach the sky in one step, not do small things, not do indigenous things, and as a result, they cannot do anything. Schools running factories should make full use of existing conditions, first run some small-scale ones, and adopt indigenous methods of production. After laying a good foundation, gradually enrich the equipment, increase production projects, and make the production labor base increasingly perfect. There are also people who advocate that the production labor base established by the school and the labor engaged in by students should be combined with the courses learned by students, or even with a certain subject or a certain lesson, otherwise they will not do it. They narrowly understand the combination of education and productive labor as the combination with teaching. Undoubtedly, schools should combine production labor with teaching as much as possible. However, primary and secondary schools are basic education, and there are many subjects to study. It is impossible to imagine that every labor can be directly combined with teaching. It is of course good to be able to combine, and we should strive in this direction; those that cannot be directly combined should also organize students to participate in productive labor at the prescribed time, as an exercise for students, which is also indispensable. If we unilaterally emphasize the combination with teaching, and do not do it if it is not combined, there is no labor base, so what is there to talk about combination? After the above-mentioned various ideas were resolved through repeated criticism and education, the school's production labor base was able to develop smoothly and be consolidated and improved.

In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's educational thought, the education work in our province has made great achievements. However, this is only the beginning. We should also continue to deeply implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor in the spirit of continuous revolution, consolidate, improve, and develop the school's production labor base, strengthen operation and management, establish and improve the financial management system, and further properly solve the problems of supply, production, and sales, so that the school's production labor base can be increasingly perfected, and more effectively promote the improvement of education quality.

Currently, the people of the whole country are vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Schools at all levels are closely surrounding this movement, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. On the one hand, they are actively reforming production tools in schools, starting from the school's existing production conditions, and striving to move in the direction of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and continuous operation; on the other hand, some schools are also participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of factories, enterprises, and people's communes outside the school in a planned, organized, and led manner, according to the characteristics of the school. This has great political and educational significance for the school. Schools' participation in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement can powerfully support industrial and agricultural production and construction, enabling education to better contribute to accelerating socialist construction. Vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution in internal production labor can greatly improve labor efficiency, achieve the requirements of "high yield, high quality, and low cost," further consolidate and develop the production labor base, and promote the school's production to a new stage. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement can promote scientific research, so that theory can be better combined with practice, which is conducive to improving the quality of education. It can be imagined that under the conditions of combining education with productive labor, and under the promotion of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a series of changes will inevitably be triggered in the school system curriculum, teaching content, teaching system, teaching methods, etc., promoting the in-depth development of the great educational revolution.

What lies before us is a magnificent and grand scene. We resolutely hold high the red banner of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, hold high the red banner of Chairman Mao's educational thought, and continue to leap forward greatly along the broad road of combining education with productive labor, on the basis of the great victory of the past educational revolution.

    教育与生产劳动相结合，是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路
    徐寿轩代表谈吉林省中小学贯彻党的教育方针的情况主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理所作的为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。现在我仅就我省中小学在贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针方面讲一些情况，请各位代表指正。
    在党中央和省委的正确领导下，吉林省的教育战线和全国一样，1958年开始掀起了一个以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心的教育大革命，取得了巨大的成就。经过整风和反右派斗争，广大师生的政治思想觉悟有了显著提高。学习毛主席提出的“培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的教育方针以后，批判了教育脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的错误，明确了培养目标，各地中、小学开始重视组织学生参加生产劳动。1957年冬，在全省范围内就出现了轰轰烈烈的勤工俭学运动，到1958年春，已经形成了高潮。运动发展的异常迅速，声势浩大。广大师生争先恐后地参加了各种工农业生产劳动和社会公益劳动，学校面貌大为改观，对社会的风气也发生了很好的影响。当年暑期前后，我们及时总结了勤工俭学运动的经验，批判了在勤工俭学中的右倾保守思想，在全省范围内又掀起了学校大办工厂的高潮，把勤工俭学推进一个新的阶段。在党中央和国务院发布了“关于教育工作的指示”以后，全省的教育工作者，认真地学习和贯彻了党的教育方针，进一步认识了教育与生产劳动相结合的重大意义，学校的生产劳动有了新的发展。与此同时，广大师生参加了全民性的炼钢、炼铁、秋收、秋翻等伟大运动，不仅支援了工农业生产大跃进，而且受到一次极有意义的锻炼。1959年2月，根据中央教育会议精神，全面地安排了教学、生产劳动和学生生活，调整了生产门路，巩固与发展了校内的生产劳动基地，把生产劳动列为正式课程，实现了劳动制度化和经常化。在党的八届八中全会提出的反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的伟大号召下，全省中、小学的生产劳动在过去的基础上，又有了新的发展。现在生产逐步稳定，设备日益充实，经营管理不断改进，组织领导更加健全，教育与生产劳动相结合的更加紧密，已经走上了巩固提高和健康发展的新阶段。
    目前，我省中、小学，不论城市或农村，不论是国家办的或是厂矿企业、机关团体、人民公社、城市街道办的，不论是全日制的或是半日制的，都普遍地建立起来生产劳动基地。绝大多数学校的基地基本够用，并且保持经常生产。根据三百六十二所普通中学统计，共有机械、电工、金木工、化工等工厂一千零二十五个，有各种金属切削机床三百三十七台，耕种土地二千四百多公顷，养猪八千多头，养鸡六万七千多只。各地小学也建立了适合儿童年龄特点的生产基地。据七千三百二十八所小学的统计，共有小五金、木工、纸工、文具、玩具、缝纫、编织等小工厂四千六百四十六个，农园七千八百二十五公顷。养猪一万八千多头，养鸡九万多只。
    由于教育与生产劳动相结合，教育质量有了显著提高，学生的德育、智育、体育得到全面发展。
    学生在劳动实践中，在与工农群众接触中，受到了阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点、集体观点和辩证唯物主义观点的教育，精神面貌、思想感情发生了深刻的变化。过去有些学生厌恶劳动，怕脏、怕累、怕丢人；现在有活争着干，认识到劳动的光荣、伟大的意义。有的中学学生在作文中写着：“当我走向木工厂，远远袭来刨花香，当我离开木工厂，好似婴儿离了娘”，表现出对劳动的浓厚兴趣。学生在和工人共同劳动当中，深深受到工人阶级的大公无私、忘我劳动高贵品质的感染，集体主义思想和组织性、纪律性增强了，认真读书、刻苦钻研已经形成风气。经过下厂下乡、参加劳动、参观人民公社等活动，学生从实践中，深刻地体验到总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的耀目的光辉和无比的力量，更加亲切地感到党的领导的英明和伟大，大大地提高了社会主义思想觉悟。因此，他们热情地歌颂：“党的教育方针光芒万丈，照亮了我们的心房，立志做能文能武的劳动者，永远前进在又红又专的道路上。”
    通过劳动，使理论结合了实际，扩大了学生的眼界，学到了感性知识，这样对课堂所学的知识，理解的快，记忆的牢。有些课程，不需要从前那么多的教学时间就学会了；同时也暴露出有些教材脱离实际，教学内容已经显得陈旧过时了，这就为多快好省地提高教学质量创造了条件，也向我们提出了继续深入教育革命，变革课程、教学内容等一系列的问题。劳动实践也丰富了学生的生活，他们在作文中，歌颂党、歌颂劳动人民、歌颂劳动的内容增多了，思想性加强了，学生的知识质量有显著的提高。去年吉林省高中毕业生报考高等学校的考试成绩比过去有很大进步。以长春市十三所初中的毕业生升学考试成绩为例，1959年总平均为六十点九分，比教育革命前的1957年增长了五点一分。在提高知识质量的同时，学生的身体也受到了良好的锻炼，疾病大为减少，体力更加增强。
    学生参加劳动以后，获得了许多工农业生产知识和技能。吉林省实验中学全校一千一百多名学生中，有三百五十名学会了车工、钳工、锻工等生产技术，二百五十多名学会了修装收音机和电话会议机等，三百多名学会了简易建筑和木工技术，二百多名学会了制造农药和土化肥等。全校学生还都不同程度地学会了耕地、施肥、播种、锄草、灌溉、收割以及饲养牲口等知识技能。这和过去大多数城市学生“四体不勤、五谷不分”的情况形成了鲜明的对照。“放下书本进工厂，脱去工装回课堂，炼的心儿红似火，学的知识像海洋”，学生就是这般热情地歌颂自己的学习劳动生活。
    不仅如此，学生参加生产劳动，还为国家创造了大量的财富。全省中学1959年生产总值为一千三百七十八万元，平均每校三万八千元。工业产品数量很大，种类繁多。全省中学生产各种机械部件一千六百四十余吨，电话会议机三千三百二十三台，化肥和农药九千八百余吨，建筑用砖一千三百一十八万块，木家具六万余件，织布十三万五千尺。全省中、小学共产粮食二千三百余万斤，经济作物三千余万斤，蔬菜七千七百余万斤。蔬菜除了自用外，还大量供应市场需要。中、小学共采集药材、山果、树籽一百一十九万斤，打柴草六千七百余万斤。师生还参加了社会公益劳动，全年无报酬地支援了国家各项建设事业和人民公社的农业生产达七百八十万个劳动日。所有这些，不仅对于支援国家工农业社会主义建设、满足人民生活需要，起了积极作用，同时也增加学校的收入，为扩大再生产、解决学生生活福利、补助部分困难学生，创造了物质条件。
    事实证明，教育与生产劳动相结合，对学生的德育、智育和体育都有好处，确实是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路。那种认为学生参加生产劳动就会降低教育质量的观点，是没有根据的，是完全错误的。
    贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合方针从根本上扭转了学校教育脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的状况，结束了几千年教育与生产劳动相分离的历史，开辟了我国教育史上的新纪元，使我国教育事业更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为实现共产主义社会服务。这是党的社会主义建设总路线在教育事业上的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利，是毛主席教育思想的胜利。
    我们在吉林省中小学贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，开展生产劳动的过程中，有下面几点体会：
    第一、实行教育与生产劳动相结合，是教育战线上的一次极为深刻的大革命。我们必须依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，才能正确贯彻党的教育方针，破资产阶级教育思想、立无产阶级教育思想，破资产阶级教育制度、立无产阶级教育制度。这个破立过程，就是严重的阶级斗争过程。勤工俭学一开始，立即引起了广大师生和社会上的注视，一时成为舆论的中心。多数人热烈拥护；部分人犹豫、观望；少数资产阶级分子和受资产阶级影响较深的人则起而攻之，说什么“勤工俭学影响学习，影响健康”。他们站在资产阶级的立场，坚持“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的错误观点，反对教育与生产劳动相结合。于是在要不要勤工俭学的问题上展开了尖锐的斗争。1959年暑假前后，当进一步强调全日制学校以教学为主，加强基础课教学的时候，有人又借机出来散布“提高教学质量就得减少劳动”的错误论调，企图以牺牲生产劳动为代价，来换取教学质量的“提高”，要把学校重新拉回到资产阶级的老路上去。我们在党的领导下，进行了两条道路、两种思想的斗争。一方面组织全体师生、干部和广大群众开展教育方针大辩论，提高认识，批判资产阶级教育思想；另一方面，培养典型，树立旗帜，总结经验，用生动有力的事实教育群众。各级党委对于学校所进行的教育革命是极为关怀和重视的，及时指明方向，解决重大的关键性问题，采取有效措施，鼓舞广大师生的革命干劲，使教育革命步步深入，不断向前发展。我们深深感到，党的领导是一切胜利的根本保证。我们所取得的成绩，是和党的领导分不开的。
    第二、建立校内的生产劳动基地，坚持以校内为主、内外结合的原则。学校建立够用的和保持经常生产的劳动基地，是实现教育与生产劳动相结合的物质基础。建立生产劳动基地，究竟采取什么形式最好呢？根据我省条件，经过两年的实践，感到最好的形式还是学校自己办工厂、农场和饲养场等。一校能办就一校办，一校办不了就几校联合办。
    建立校内的生产劳动基地的好处很多：固定了劳动场地，劳动容易经常化、制度化；学校能主动安排教学和劳动；可以根据学生不同特点分配劳动；容易做到多样化，便于结合教学。
    学校建立自己的劳动基地，在资金、设备、原料技术力量等方面有一定的困难。我省各地学校，由于党委和政府的重视，各方面的支持，以及全体师生的努力，采取下列各种办法，使这些问题基本上得到解决。（1）利用原有旧机器和简单设备，使工厂逐步充实扩大；（2）争取社会支援；（3）纳入地方生产计划，或为外单位加工，资金、设备、供销等问题由有关部门帮助解决；（4）当地教育、财政部门暂时借给资金；（5）把适合学校经营的小型工厂拨给学校；（6）基础好的学校帮助条件差的或新建的学校；（7）采取“请进来指导”、“派出去学习”，以及师生自己钻研与配备固定技术工人相结合的办法，解决技术力量。此外，还有联校办厂和厂校协作、工厂在校内建立车间等形式。
    为了使学生能够有更多的机会接触工农群众，接触大规模的生产，接触社会实际，各地学校都根据条件，除在校内建立一定的生产基地外，还和厂矿、人民公社挂钩，组织学生下厂下乡劳动，把校内劳动和校外劳动结合起来。
    除建立上述的生产劳动基地外，我们根据中央指示，也安排了社会公益劳动。在春耕、夏锄、秋收等农忙季节，学校都按规定主动地组织学生参加这些劳动。学生参加了公益劳动，不仅支援了工农业生产建设，而且能够受到深刻的教育，了解了党的中心任务，使自己和国家的建设事业紧密地联系在一起。
    第三、学校建立生产劳动基地，要从实际条件出发，因地制宜。吉林省土地辽阔，资源丰富，有平原、有山区、半山区、有草原。各地学校根据不同地区的特点，确定了不同的生产项目。城市学校的重点是搞工业，有条件的地方也积极地经营了一些农田，种蔬菜，搞饲养。农村学校的重点是搞农业，结合进行农、林、牧、副、渔生产，发展多种经营，有条件的地方也积极地举办了为农业服务的工厂。山区学校，除了经营工农业以外，还搞特产。通化地区的学校搞了“三厂（场）、三园、一采集”。“三厂（场）”是工厂、农场、饲养场；“三园”是果园、药园和菜园；“一采集”是采集药材、山果和树籽等。草原地区，除了经营农业以外，还发展了畜牧业，大办盐、碱、硝工厂和小型化工厂，大搞打草、打苇子、编织等副业。
    第四、在建立生产劳动基地的过程中，各地学校坚持了白手起家、因陋就简，从小到大，从土到洋，土洋并举的原则。两年实践证明，这是多快好省地建立学校生产劳动基地的必经之路，是一条发展规律。凡是遵循这个原则办的，生产基地很快地就建立起来了。但是，这条规律不是一下子就被人们所接受了的，在工作中也曾有过斗争。有人干劲不足，强调困难，抱着上级不支持不搞，不纳入国家计划不搞的态度，对于能够克服的困难，不去积极克服。事实证明，只要依靠党的领导，放手发动群众，好多问题都能得到解决。学校的生产应该逐步纳入国家计划，但是中小学的生产项目有些不是一开始就能纳入计划的，只有有了基础，生产搞好了以后才能逐步纳入计划。如果一律等待纳入计划后再搞，那就搞不起来。也有的学校，想一步登天，不搞小的，不搞土的，结果什么也搞不起来。学校办工厂，应该充分利用现有条件，先办一些小型的，采用土法生产。待打好了基础以后，再逐步充实设备，增加生产项目，使生产劳动基地日益完善起来。还有人主张，学校建立的生产劳动基地和学生所从事的劳动都要和学生所学的课程结合，甚至要和某一科、某一课结合，不然就不搞。他们把教育与生产劳动相结合，狭隘地理解为与教学相结合。无疑的，学校搞生产劳动，应该尽可能地结合教学。但是，中小学是基础教育，学习的科目很多，不可能设想每项劳动都能与教学直接结合。能够结合的当然好，而且应当朝这个方向努力；不能直接结合的，也应该按规定的时间组织学生参加生产劳动，做为对学生的锻炼，也是不可少的。如果片面强调结合教学，不结合就不搞，没有劳动基地了，还谈什么结合。上述各种思想，经过反复不断地批判教育得到解决后，学校的生产劳动基地才得到顺利地发展和巩固提高。
    两年来，我省教育工作，在党中央和省委的正确领导下，在毛主席的教育思想的指导下，取得了巨大的成就。但是，这仅仅是开始。我们还应该以不断革命的精神，继续深入地贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，巩固提高和发展学校的生产劳动基地，加强经营管理，建立和健全财务管理制度，进一步妥善地解决供产销的问题，使学校的生产劳动基地日益完善起来，更有效地促进教育质量的提高。
    当前，全国人民正在轰轰烈烈地开展技术革新和技术革命运动。各级学校正在紧紧地围绕这个运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命。一方面在校内积极地改革生产工具，从学校现有的生产条件出发，努力地朝着机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、连续化的方向前进；另一方面，有的学校也根据学校的特点，有计划、有组织、有领导地参加校外工厂企业、人民公社的技术革新和技术革命运动。这样作，对于学校具有重大的政治意义和教育意义。学校参加技术革新和技术革命运动，能够有力地支援工农业生产建设，使教育更好地为加速社会主义建设贡献出力量。校内的生产劳动大搞技术革新和技术革命，可以大大地提高劳动效率，实现“高产、优质、低成本”的要求，更加巩固和发展生产劳动基地，将学校的生产推向一个新的阶段。技术革新和技术革命运动能够推进科学研究，使理论更好地结合实际，有利于提高教育质量。可以设想，在教育与生产劳动相结合的条件下，在技术革新和技术革命运动的推动下，必将引起学制课程、教学内容、教学制度、教学方法等一系列的变革，促进教育大革命的深入发展。
    摆在我们面前的，是一幅壮丽的宏伟的景象。我们坚决高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，高举毛主席教育思想的红旗，沿着教育与生产劳动相结合的康庄大道，在过去教育革命的伟大胜利的基础上，持续大跃进。
