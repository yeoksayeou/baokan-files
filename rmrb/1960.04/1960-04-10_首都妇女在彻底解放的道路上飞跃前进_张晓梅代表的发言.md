    Capital Women Leap Forward on the Road to Complete Liberation
    Speech by Delegate Zhang Xiaomei

    Chairman, fellow delegates:
    I fully agree with the report on the draft 1960 national economic plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the 1959 national final accounts and the draft 1960 national budget made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I would like to report to the Congress on the participation of the broad masses of housewives in Beijing in social production and the comprehensive organization of economic life based on the development of production.

    250,000 Housewives in the Capital Participate in Social Labor
    Since 1958, on the basis of the rectification movement among street residents, and inspired by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, Beijing's streets have undergone earth-shaking changes through two years of continuous Great Leap Forward. In order to build socialism and for the complete liberation of women, the broad masses of housewives have vigorously established street industries and large-scale social collective welfare and service undertakings. Now, 250,000 people have participated in social labor, approaching 80% of the residents in the streets who are of working age. It is truly "everyone engaged in production, no idle person in any household," and the idea of labor being glorious is taking shape. This is a great social transformation, which not only changes the face of the city from every corner, but also constantly changes the ideological consciousness of the residents. It is an important aspect of building a new socialist city and an important condition for the development of urban people's communes.

    Hundreds of thousands of housewives mobilized to vigorously develop industry have established more than 770 street factories in a short period of time. This is truly something that has never happened before. "Housewives have no funds, no equipment, and no technology. Is it possible to run industry?" Many people once had this question. However, the Party believes in the awareness and strength of the broad masses of women and resolutely supports their urgent desire to participate in socialist construction. Women, with lofty communist spirit and heroic courage, vigorously developed industry. If there were no funds, everyone would contribute, working hard and enduring hardship, doing volunteer labor for three months. Remuneration was discussed only after production had a foundation. If there was no equipment, they started from scratch, "using corridors as workshops and courtyards as factories." This was the moving scene in the early days of Beijing's street factories. The relevant government departments, especially the industrial and commercial departments, provided strong assistance. The Changxindian Enamel Small Hardware Factory was started by the masses borrowing nine pairs of pliers to produce various small daily necessities such as plug pins, collar hooks, and fire pokers. Over the past year, it has added more than 50 machines, such as punching machines, lathes, and electric threading machines, from labor accumulation. The path taken by the Changxindian Enamel Small Hardware Factory is the glorious and victorious path experienced by street factories throughout the city. When women first participated in production, they did not understand technology, but they made great ambitions, eagerly studied and delved into it, and humbly sought advice from teachers and friends, unafraid of failure and unafraid of difficulties. Now, they have not only mastered technology and improved their ideological awareness, but also learned the skills to manage and organize production; and many people have become advanced figures in the current vigorous movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. Zhao Aimei, a woman from the Dashilar Glass Instrument Factory, carried out a technological innovation that increased the efficiency of acid etching on glass tubes by a hundredfold. Another woman from this factory, Wang Caiqin, was not satisfied with this and further innovated, increasing the efficiency by another two times on the basis of Zhao Aimei's hundredfold increase. There are many more vivid examples of such technological innovations and improvements in operating techniques that have increased production efficiency by several or dozens of times. In the activities to celebrate the "March 8th" International Women's Day, women in the 28 street factories in Xicheng District alone put forward more than 2,800 rationalization proposals for technological innovation, of which more than 2,400 have already been implemented. These facts powerfully answer those who thought that housewives were "ignorant" and "knew nothing"; the fact is: "The lowly are the most intelligent; the noble are the most ignorant." Once the labor force of housewives is liberated, it can exert amazing power.

    Street factories have become a new force on the Beijing industrial front. The production of street factories is flexible and diverse, and it is easier to change varieties. Products have gone from simple to complex, and now they have reached more than 500 varieties. Street factories serve the people's lives. They do not dislike the trouble or the small output value of many small daily industrial products, but try their best to produce them as long as the people's lives need them. Street factories are increasingly becoming a powerful assistant to large state-owned industries. For example, 20% of the total output value of the Beijing Hat Factory in 1959 was completed by street production personnel who processed for them. Thanks to the processing of street industries, the factory overfulfilled the state plan without increasing factory buildings, investment, equipment, or personnel. In 1959, this factory saved 80,000 yuan in capital on machinery and equipment alone. The road that the Changxindian Enamel Small Hardware Factory has taken is precisely the glorious and victorious road that street factories throughout the city have experienced. Now, street industry is not just making shoe soles, twisting hemp ropes, and pasting paper boxes, but can also produce some relatively high-end products such as instruments and meters. Some state-owned factories have transferred part of their products (along with some machinery and equipment) to street industry for production, and freed up their forces to produce more advanced and precise products. In this way, linking street factories with large industries can not only accelerate the speed of the Great Leap Forward of large industries, but also create conditions for the gradual modernization of street factories.

    Street Industries Run by Housewives Develop at an Astonishing Speed
    Delegates: The street industries run by these housewives who have no funds, no equipment, and no technology have developed at an extremely astonishing speed. The output value (including processing output value) increased elevenfold in the eight months from June 1959 to February this year. The total output value of street industries in the city in the first quarter of this year has reached 170 million yuan, equivalent to the total industrial output value of the city in 1949. From the end of the Qing Dynasty to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, these reactionary rulers left Beijing with a total industrial output value of only 170 million yuan, while the housewives of Beijing, starting from scratch under the leadership of the Party, have built up an industry whose output value in three months is equal to their annual output value for nearly a century in just two years. Does this fact not extremely eloquently illustrate the brilliance of the Party's General Line? Does it not powerfully prove the invincible power of the mass movement led by the Party? Does it not fully demonstrate the infinite enthusiasm and wisdom of the working women who were once poor and blank, once liberated?

    Why is the demand of housewives to participate in social labor so urgent? Why is their enthusiasm so great? This is not only because they love socialism and hope to build the socialist motherland well with their own hands; it is also because they understand that only by participating in social labor can they liberate themselves from the shackles of family trivialities, change the subordinate status of women for thousands of years, and realize the complete liberation of women. At the same time, this can further improve the economic life of the whole family, unify the thinking of the whole family, and live a truly happy life. Therefore, no resistance can make them retreat from the ranks of building socialism and return to the side of the small cooking stove. Shi Peilan, the director of the electroplating workshop of the Andingmen Electroplating Factory, is one of countless such women. She is the mother of six children. Why is she able to actively participate in voluntary labor to dig sand and gravel? Why is she able to gather a few cents each with several women to pull city bricks and build factory buildings from scratch? This is because she, the wife of a railway worker, could not afford to raise one child even if the couple worked hard all day long before liberation; but after liberation, they had six children, and their life was very happy. The children went to middle school, primary school, and kindergarten; she knew: "Building socialism and communism is even happier!" However, in the past, she was in the family "the money was earned by others, and she could not make decisions." Today, she has improved from illiterate to a high school education level, from completely ignorant of production to becoming the director of the workshop and a Communist Party member. Besides following the Party, and rushing to where the Party points, besides wholeheartedly building socialism, what greater happiness is there? Someone once shouted: "Women are too bitter! It is better to go home and be happy!" But the broad masses of women, like Shi Peilan, are not afraid. They are wholeheartedly pursuing the happiness of socialism and communism, and they are unwilling to live a subordinate and parasitic bitter life. More and more housewives in Beijing are throwing themselves into social labor and participating in street production and service undertakings. There were 140,000 people in 1958, 180,000 in 1959, and now 250,000, of which 95% are housewives. There are very few people who have the labor force and have no special difficulties but do not participate in labor.

    With the rapid development and expansion of street industry, in addition to being used for accumulation and running various collective welfare undertakings, the wage income of production personnel has also increased. At the end of 1958, the average wage of street production personnel was about 15 yuan, and now it has increased to about 23 yuan in addition to collective welfare. Because housewives participate in production, family income has increased, and people's lives have greatly improved. According to a survey of 70 people in the first workshop of the Erlong Road Electric Appliance Factory, their wage income alone accounted for 38% of the original family income.

    Collective Welfare Undertakings Are Established on a Large Scale, and the Broad Masses of Working Women Smile
    Adapting to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production and the participation of the broad masses of women in social labor, collective life welfare undertakings and service undertakings, and the socialization of housework are rapidly developing, consolidating, and improving. Now, 4,570 canteens have been set up in the city's streets, with more than 155,000 people joining; there are more than 3,300 childcare organizations, taking care of more than 80,800 children; and there are more than 3,700 street service stations (centers). The large-scale establishment of collective life welfare undertakings and social service undertakings makes the broad masses of people, especially women workers, smile. Such a profound change involving the life of every family is bound to cause various different views and opinions.

    Is it better to take children to a nursery than to take them at home? Some people are skeptical. Here I would like to give two examples. The Chayuan Kindergarten of the Erlong Road People's Commune was originally established by street women working hard and enduring hardship, and now it is a full-time kindergarten taking care of 92 children. The children are healthy and lively, and the living, education, and sanitation work are done well. At the end of August last year, hepatitis was discovered, and isolation and disinfection were carried out immediately, and the children's nutrition was increased, so no other children were infected. In the technical revolution movement, the childcare workers also made 90 pieces of native washing machines, stuffing machines, teaching aids, and toys, which were trusted and praised by parents. Another example is that since the Great Leap Forward, more than 800 family members of employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant have participated in production, and most of their children, from newborns to preschool children, have been sent to the cement plant's nursery. Eighty percent of the childcare workers in the nursery are newly employed family members of employees. They realize that taking care of children is very important and try their best to improve their work, thinking about the children and mothers everywhere. The reception time is flexible, and the methods are diverse. The nursery takes care of all the children's eating, dressing, care, and education. In terms of food, it takes care of nutrition and makes a variety of patterns that children love to eat. In education, education is carried out according to the education plan and according to the different ages and personalities of the children. The childcare workers also made hundreds of toys by themselves to make the children have fun. It is truly "mothers are satisfied and children are happy." It is precisely because a large number of nurseries have been established that the problem of children dragging their feet has been solved, allowing mothers to leave the family and participate in social labor as they wish; it is precisely because nurseries educate and raise children better than at home that mothers can work on production jobs without any worries and with full enthusiasm. Among the more than 800 family members participating in production in the Liulihe Cement Plant, more than 200 have won the honorary title of quarterly advanced producers and advanced workers, and four mothers attended the city's heroic meeting. The mothers wrote a poem to praise the nursery: "Children enter the nursery better than home, seeing the auntie is like seeing their mother, eating well, playing well, and growing strong, mothers can let go of their hearts and labor." This poem expresses the sincere wishes of the broad masses of mothers, their views on nurseries, and their heartfelt thanks to the thousands of childcare workers. Facts have proved that the childcare organizations created by the masses can be run well and can enable children to receive better and more comprehensive care than families, from nutrition to health care, from education to games, and receive collectivist education that families cannot have. It is completely understandable that the broad masses of women love childcare organizations and urgently demand the establishment of more childcare organizations. Because, without childcare organizations, how can women be liberated from the burden of children? How can they participate in social labor?

    Is it superior to bind hundreds of thousands of women to small coal stoves to cook for themselves? Or is it superior to liberate them to participate in social labor? The example of Chen Zhenying, a housewife in Xinjiekou, gave the best answer. Chen Zhenying is the mother of three children. Encouraged by socialist construction, she participated in social labor, but before the problem of the canteen was solved, she had to get up before dawn every day, and starting the stove and cooking took up a lot of time. She had no time to comb her hair and went to work, and sometimes she was late. She had to get off work earlier than others at noon and in the evening. When she returned home, the stove was out. By the time the fire was restarted and the food was cooked, the children were sleepy, and her lover was late for work. The couple quarreled. After working like this for half a month, she had to return home with tears in her eyes. When she was worried: when can I leave the family and serve the motherland? The street canteen was established, and her whole family joined. She happily returned to her work post. Women like Chen Zhenying will never have doubts about whether the canteen is superior or not. Without the canteen, she would have to continue to turn the small cooking stove like women have experienced for thousands of years, bound by household chores, and unable to be liberated. With the canteen, she can become a member of building socialism like her husband. There are thousands of such women and masses like Chen Zhenying, and they all firmly demand collective life. It is precisely because of this that women are running canteens with great enthusiasm. Now there are large canteens with hundreds or thousands of people and also small and medium-sized simple canteens in the streets of Beijing. Some larger canteens also have the nature of staple food processing plants. They process staple food for small canteens, leading the small ones with the large ones, playing a backbone role. For example, the Jiudaowan Canteen of the Beixinqiao People's Commune was started by three housewives from scratch during the Great Leap Forward. Now it has developed into a large canteen with eighteen rooms, twenty staff members, and more than 800 people eating. They worked hard and cleverly, imitating 14 kinds of simple cooking tools such as flour mixers, rice washing machines, vegetable cutting machines, and stuffing machines, and installed hard gas boilers and ovens. This canteen has a variety of staple and non-staple foods, from inexpensive pot dishes to high-quality stir-fried dishes, so it can meet the different needs of the masses. For the elderly, pregnant women, and patients, the canteen pays attention to making some thin and soft dishes to take care of them. During the New Year and festivals, this canteen also prepares inexpensive and good-quality "unity seats" and "Great Leap Forward seats." In addition to supplying food and drink for more than 800 people every day, they also process and make staple food for 18 surrounding small canteens, guiding and helping these small canteens to improve cooking technology and management work. The small canteens make their own non-staple food, which is convenient for the masses and enables the large and small canteens to be combined into a network and a set. The emergence of large canteens or staple food processing plants has created favorable conditions for the mechanization of food production. At present, many large canteens have some mechanized food processing equipment like the Jiudaowan Canteen. In the past, at least one labor force had to be occupied by each household to cook. I don't know how many housewives' lives were spent on this. The narrow world and trivial housework limited their development and improvement in politics and culture. Now, 20 people like the Jiudaowan Canteen not only make food for more than 800 people, but also make processed staple food for many small canteens. In contrast, this is such a big saving!

    Service Centers and Stations Are New Forms of Comprehensively Organizing Scattered Housework
    With the continuous leap forward in production, the broad masses of street women not only require the solution of the main household chores such as taking care of children and cooking, but also urgently require the solution of the socialization of trivial housework. Service centers and service stations are new forms created by the masses themselves to comprehensively organize scattered housework. This new type of service organization has now been established in the streets of the city. They serve a wide range, in a flexible manner, and are convenient for the masses. Some well-run units have also adopted methods of serving households in different areas and contracting housework, truly doing what the masses need. For example, the Qiujiajie Service Station of the Chunshu Hutong People's Commune in Xuanwu District is one such example. Their service items include dismantling, washing, sewing, mending, repairing leather shoes, casual shoes, furniture, picking up and dropping off children, taking care of patients and maternity women, time-based childcare, asking doctors to visit, paying rent and electricity bills, and handling bank savings, totaling more than 120 items. Recently, they have also implemented the method of contracting housework by household. The service station is responsible for washing clothes and mending socks; another method is to contract trivial housework for employees and cadres who work all day long, cleaning the interior, starting the stove, filling hot water bottles, taking out the trash, picking up and dropping off children, etc. The method of contracting housework is very flexible, and it can be contracted in full or in a single item. This service form is a good form of developing from organizing major household chores to further comprehensively organizing people's lives. The broad masses of people warmly welcome this service organization, praising the service station for "thinking thoroughly, arriving in time, and ensuring production leap forward and a good life." Liu Fuquan, a worker's family member living in No. 5 Mianhua Street, participated in street production, and his children entered the kindergarten. His whole family joined the canteen in the courtyard, and the dismantling, washing, and sewing were contracted to the Qiujiajie Service Station. He always smiled and said to people, "The Party's comprehensive organization of people's lives is so good. I have participated in work, and someone takes care of housework. I am so happy." Isn't the superiority of collective life and the socialization of housework obvious? Of course, everything has a development process from low to high. We generally lack experience in running canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings. Some are well-run, and some are not well-run enough. Running canteens and nurseries well is not only the responsibility of street women, but also the responsibility of the whole society. Because production and life promote each other, only by better organizing people's economic life and running collective welfare and service undertakings on a large scale can we adapt to the needs of the continuous development of socialist production. Engels once said more than 100 years ago: "With public canteens and public service stations, two-thirds of the people engaged in this work will be easily liberated, and the remaining one-third will be able to complete their work better and more attentively than now." Engels' prediction is rapidly becoming a living reality here.

    Participation in social labor and collective life has greatly changed the mental outlook of housewives and their status in the family and society. Some people think that the widespread participation of women in social labor will affect the happiness of family life. It depends on what kind of family it is. The participation of women in social labor has most thoroughly destroyed the remnants of feudal patriarchal family relations. This destruction is really something that the broad masses of people, especially the broad masses of women, should cheer for. Women will no longer live a parasitic life and will no longer rely on others. What's wrong with this? On the contrary, only after the broad masses of women have widely participated in social labor and collective life can they establish a new type of beautiful family that is democratic, harmonious, equal, mutually helpful, and has common goals. Li Guihua, from the Beixinqiao Knitting Factory, had disharmony in her family before she participated in street production, and the husband and wife and mother-in-law often quarreled. Since Li Guihua participated in street production, worked hard, and overfulfilled the production target every month, she completed the annual production task for 1959 two months ahead of schedule and became a pacesetter in the factory. Her ideological awareness improved, and her family income also increased. The family has changed since then. The daughter-in-law is valued by her parents-in-law. When it is cold at night shift, her father-in-law sends clothes and her mother-in-law sends food. On Sundays, her lover gets off work and personally picks her up to go to the movies. She and her husband often talk about the Great Leap Forward plan and technological innovation, and the family's feelings are more harmonious than in the past. Now, thousands of new families like Li Guihua have been established. In such a new type of family, the husband no longer says to his wife: "You are eating my noodles." In the past, the husband said: "What do you know?" There is a lack of common language between husband and wife. Now they talk about work, study, and national affairs together. This new type of family relationship is making the broad masses of people and women more motivated and their enthusiasm for labor more high-spirited.

    Through Practical Exercise, Women's Political Awareness and Leadership Ability Are Continuously Improved
    Through practical exercise, women's political awareness and leadership ability are constantly improving. In street factories, there are 624 female factory directors, and many women serve as heads of canteens, nurseries, and service stations. More than 250 street women attended the city's industrial heroic meeting held in February this year. More than 300 "March 8th Red Banner Bearers" and "March 8th Red Banner Collectives" were rewarded by the All-China Women's Federation and the Municipal Women's Federation. Two hundred and seventy-five street women also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. For example, Tang Shuzhen, the female factory director and Communist Party member of the Jianguomen Gold Lacquer Inlay Factory in Dongcheng District, was originally a housewife. In March last year, she led 14 housewives to form a gold lacquer inlay team. Now this team has developed into a factory with more than 200 people. In her work, she has achieved the goals of grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life, leading the factory in an orderly manner, and constantly improving the output and quality of products. The output of this factory in February this year increased by more than eleven times compared with March last year, and all the quality of the products leaving the factory was qualified, so it was rated as a red flag unit in Beijing and a national March 8th Red Banner Collective unit. Such advanced figures are constantly emerging.

    Practice has proved that only under the socialist system, only under the leadership of the Communist Party, is it possible to so widely organize women to engage in social labor, run collective life welfare undertakings and service undertakings on a large scale, gradually socialize and collectivize the scattered household labor of the past, give full play to women's talents, thoroughly liberate women, and achieve true equality between men and women. Lenin said: "The liberation of women is the measure of social liberation." The change in the mental outlook of women has also promoted the change in the entire social outlook. The reason why this change has come so quickly is the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Running street production on a large scale and running collective welfare undertakings on a large scale have laid a good foundation for the establishment of urban people's communes. As early as 1958, we selected different types of areas for pilot work on people's communes. After more than a year of trial, we have gained experience, proving that the urban people's commune is also the best form of organization for urban people, and the establishment of the urban people's commune is another extremely profound revolution and also the road to the complete liberation of the broad masses of women. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "Only when class society no longer exists, heavy labor is automated, and agriculture is also mechanized can true equality between men and women be truly realized." Socialist society is the primary stage of communist society. Only in communist society can we completely eliminate the remnants of bourgeois rights and completely eliminate all the backward aspects in politics, ideology, culture, and work ability left to women in history, and completely complete the cause of women's liberation. Therefore, we must never stagnate and be content with the status quo. We must adhere to continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, and continue to advance the women's movement with the development of the socialist construction cause in the capital.

    首都妇女在彻底解放的道路上飞跃前进
    张晓梅代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和人大常委的工作报告。现在，我仅就北京市广大的家庭妇女参加社会生产劳动，并在发展生产的基础上，全面组织经济生活的情况，向大会汇报。
    首都二十五万家庭妇女参加了社会劳动
    从1958年以来，在街道居民整风运动的基础上，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的鼓舞下，经过两年的持续大跃进，北京的街道上出现了翻天复地的大变化。广大家庭妇女为了建设社会主义，为了妇女的彻底解放，大办街道工业，大办社会集体福利事业和服务事业，现在已经有二十五万人参加社会劳动，已接近街道中适合劳动力年龄居民的80％，真是“人人闹生产，家家无闲人”，劳动光荣正在形成风气，这是伟大的社会改造，它不但从每个角落改变着城市的面貌，而且不断地改变着居民的思想意识，它是建设社会主义新城市的一个重要的方面，是发展城市人民公社的重要条件。
    二十几万家庭妇女动员起来大办工业，在短短的时间内，就办起了七百七十多个街道工厂，这真是自古以来所没有的事情。“家庭妇女一无资金，二无设备，三无技术，办工业行吗？”不少人曾经有过这个疑问。但是，党相信广大妇女群众的觉悟和力量，坚决支持她们要求参加社会主义建设的迫切愿望。妇女们以崇高的共产主义风格和英雄气概，大办工业。没有资金就大家凑，穷干、苦干，义务劳动三个月，生产有了底子以后，再讲报酬；没有设备，就白手起家，“过道作车间，大院作厂房”，这正是北京街道工厂初办时期的动人景象。政府的有关部门，尤其是工业和商业部门，给了有力的帮助。长辛店搪瓷小五金厂，是由群众借了九把钳子办起来的，生产插头针、领钩、火筷子等多种零星日用品。一年来已经从劳动积累中添置了冲床、旋床、电动压丝机等五十多台机械。长辛店搪瓷小五金厂所走过的道路，正是全市街道工厂所经历过的光荣的胜利的道路。妇女们刚一参加生产时，不懂技术，但是她们立下了雄心壮志，如饥似渴地苦学苦钻，虚心诚意寻师访友，不怕失败，不怕困难。现在她们不但掌握了技术，提高了思想觉悟，学会了管理和组织生产的本领；而且许多人在目前轰轰烈烈的技术革新、技术革命的运动中，成为先进的人物了。大栅栏玻璃仪器厂的妇女赵爱梅进行了一项技术革新，使玻璃管刻度上酸的效率提高了一百倍，而这个工厂的另一个妇女王彩琴并不以此为满足，她又进一步革新，在赵爱梅提高一百倍的基础上又提高了两倍。像这样一些技术革新和改进操作技术，使生产效率几倍、几十倍提高的生动事例还很多。在今年迎接“三八”节的立功献礼活动中，光是西城区的二十八个街道工厂中的妇女，就提出技术革新的合理化建议二千八百多条，其中已经实行的就有二千四百多条。这些事实，有力地答复了那些以为家庭妇女是“愚昧的”，“什么都不懂”的人；事实正是：“卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢。”家庭妇女的劳动力一旦得到解放，就能发挥出惊人的力量。
    街道工厂已经成为北京工业战线上的一支新生力量。街道工厂的生产灵活、多样，改变品种比较容易，产品由简单到复杂，现在已经达到五百多种。街道工厂为人民生活服务，许多零星细小的日用工业品，只要人民生活需要的，她们都不嫌其烦、不嫌其产值小，而尽量生产。街道工厂日益成为国营大工业的有力助手。如北京制帽厂1959年全年产值的20％是由为他们加工的街道生产人员完成的，由于有了街道工业的加工，这个厂就在不增加厂房、不增加投资、设备和人员的情况下超额完成了国家计划，1959年这个厂光是机器设备一项就节约了资金八万元。现在街道工业已经不仅是纳鞋底、搓麻绳、糊纸盒了，还能生产一部分仪器、仪表等相当高级的产品了。有些国营工厂已经把一部分产品（连同一部分机器设备）下放给街道工业生产，而腾出力量去生产更高级精密的产品。这样，街道工厂和大工业联系起来，不但可以加快大工业的跃进速度，而且也为街道工厂的逐步走向现代化生产，创造了条件。
    家庭妇女办的街道工业，以惊人速度飞跃发展
    代表们：就是这些一无资金，二无设备，三无技术的家庭妇女所办的街道工业，以极其惊人的速度飞跃发展。产值（包括加工产值）从1959年6月到今年2月的八个月中，增长了十一倍。今年第一季度全市街道工业的总产值已经达到一亿七千万元，相当于1949年全市工业的总产值。从清朝末叶到蒋介石反动集团，这些反动统治者总共只给北京留下了一亿七千万元产值的工业，而北京的家庭妇女，在党的领导下白手起家，只要两年的时间所办起来的工业三个月的产值就等于他们搞了近百年的年产值；这一事实，不是极其雄辩地说明了党的总路线的光芒万丈吗？不是有力地证明了党所领导的群众运动的无往而不胜的威力吗？不是充分显示了一穷二白的劳动妇女一旦解放出来所发挥的无穷的干劲和智慧吗？
    为什么家庭妇女参加社会劳动的要求这样迫切？干劲这样大？这不仅是因为她们爱社会主义，盼望用自己的双手把社会主义祖国建设好；也因为她们懂得只有参加社会劳动，才能把自己从家庭琐事的束缚中解放出来，改变几千年来妇女的从属地位，实现妇女的彻底解放。同时，这样还能使全家的经济生活进一步改善，全家的思想一致，过真正幸福的生活。因此，任何阻力再也不能使她们从建设社会主义的行列中倒退，回到小锅台旁边去。安定门电镀厂车间主任史培兰，就是无数这样的妇女的一个。她是六个孩子的妈妈，为什么她能够积极地参加义务劳动挖砂石？为什么她能够和几个妇女每人凑几毛钱自己拉城砖，白手起家盖厂房？这是因为她，一个铁路工人的妻子，在解放前两口子终日劳累养一个孩子还养不活；而在解放后他们有了六个孩子，生活反而很幸福，孩子们分别上了中学、小学、幼儿园；她知道：“建成社会主义、共产主义更幸福！”但是，过去她在家庭里“钱是人家挣的，自己不能拿主意”，而今天，她已经从文盲提高到高小文化程度，从完全不懂生产到当了车间主任，成了共产党员。除了跟着党走，党指到那就奔向那，除了全心全意建设社会主义，难道还有什么更大的幸福吗？有人曾喊道：“妇女太苦啦！还是回到家里去幸福！”可是广大妇女就像史培兰这样昂然不顾，她们一心一意追求的是社会主义、共产主义的幸福，她们不愿意过从属的寄生的苦日子。北京的家庭妇女越来越多地投身社会劳动，参加街道生产和服务事业的，1958年是十四万人，1959年增到十八万人，现在增到二十五万人了，其中95％是家庭妇女。有劳动力又没有什么特殊困难而不参加劳动的人已经是很少了。
    随着街道工业的迅速发展和扩大，除了用于积累和举办各种集体福利事业以外，生产人员工资收入也增加了。1958年底，一般街道生产人员的平均工资约十五元左右，现在除集体福利以外，已增加到二十三元左右。由于家庭妇女参加了生产，家庭收入增加了，人民的生活大大改善了。据二龙路电器厂一车间的七十个人的调查，仅她们的工资收入，就占原来家庭收入的38％。
    集体福利事业大量兴办，广大劳动妇女笑逐颜开
    适应着生产大跃进和广大妇女参加社会劳动的需要，集体生活福利事业和服务事业、家务劳动社会化正在迅速地发展、巩固和提高。现在全市街道已办起了四千五百七十处食堂，有十五万五千多人入伙；共有托儿组织三千三百多处，收托儿童八万零八百多人；街道服务站（所）有三千七百余处。集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业的大量兴办，使广大人民特别是妇女劳动者笑逐颜开。这样一桩牵涉到每个家庭生活的深刻变革，也必然引起各种不同的看法和舆论。
    托儿所带孩子，是不是比家里带的好呢？有人是怀疑的。在这里我想举两个例子。二龙路人民公社察院幼儿园，原来是街道妇女穷干、苦干办起来的，现在已经是一个收托九十二名儿童的全托幼儿园。孩子们健康活泼，生活、教育和卫生工作都做得好，去年8月底发现肝炎，立刻进行隔离消毒，增加孩子的营养，就没有再感染别的孩子。保育人员在技术革命运动中，还制作了土洗衣机、挤馅机、教具玩具九十多件，受到家长的信任和赞许。又如大跃进以来，琉璃河水泥厂有八百多名职工家属参加了生产，她们的孩子从初生的婴儿到学龄前的儿童，都绝大部分送到水泥厂的托儿所。托儿所的保教人员80％都是新参加工作的职工家属，她们认识到看孩子很重要，千方百计地改进工作，处处为孩子和妈妈着想。收托时间灵活，方式多样，孩子们的吃饭、穿衣、护理、教育等，托儿所都全部包管起来。在伙食上，既照顾到营养、又做到花样多，孩子们爱吃。在教育上，按照教育计划，根据孩子的不同年龄和个性进行教育。保育员还自己动手制作了几百件玩具，使孩子们玩的好。真正做到了“妈妈满意，孩子欢喜”。正是因为举办了大量的托儿所，才解决了孩子赘腿问题，使妈妈们称心如愿地走出家庭，参加社会劳动；正是由于托儿所教养孩子比在家里好，妈妈们在生产工作岗位上才能无牵无挂，干劲十足。琉璃河水泥厂的八百多名参加生产的家属中，就有二百多名次获得了季度先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣称号，还有四名孩子妈妈出席了市群英会，妈妈们写了一首诗来赞扬托儿所：“孩子进所比家强，见了阿姨如见娘，吃好、玩好身体壮，母亲劳动把心放。”这首诗朴实真挚地表达了广大母亲的心愿，表达了她们对托儿所的看法，和她们对成千上万保育人员的衷心感谢。事实证明，群众创办的托儿组织完全能够办得好，能够使孩子从营养到保健，从教育到游戏，得到比家庭更好的全面的关怀，受到家庭所不能有的集体主义教育。广大妇女群众热爱托儿组织，迫切要求多办托儿组织，是完全可以理解的。因为，没有托儿组织，妇女怎样能从孩子的牵累中解放出来呢？怎样能参加社会劳动呢？
    是把成千上万的妇女束缚在小煤球炉子上自己做饭优越呢？还是使她们解放出来参加社会劳动优越呢？新街口家庭妇女陈振英的例子作了最好的回答。陈振英是三个孩子的妈妈，为社会主义建设所鼓舞，参加了社会劳动，可是在食堂问题没解决前，每天早晨天不亮就得起床，生炉子做饭占去很多时间，来不及梳头就去上班，还有时迟到，中午和晚上要比别人提前下班，回到家里炉子灭了，等到重新生起火来，饭熟了，孩子也困了，爱人上班也误了，两口子吵嘴，这样工作了半个月，她不得不含着眼泪又回到家里去。当她正在发愁：什么时候我可以走出家庭为祖国服务啊？街道食堂成立起来了，她全家入了伙，她又欢天喜地地回到了工作岗位。像陈振英这样的妇女她是根本不会产生食堂优越不优越的疑问的。没有食堂她就要像几千年来妇女经历的那样继续转小锅台，束缚在家务琐事中，而不得解放。有了食堂，她就能够和丈夫一样成为建设社会主义的一员了。像陈振英这样的妇女和群众有千千万万，他们都是坚决要求集体生活的。正是因为这样，妇女们才以极大的热情来办食堂。现在北京街道上既有几百人、上千人的大食堂，也有中、小型的简易的食堂。一些较大型的食堂，还具有主食加工厂的性质，他们为小型食堂加工主食，以大带小，发挥了骨干作用。例如，北新桥人民公社九道湾食堂，是在大跃进中由三个家庭妇女白手起家办起来的。现在已发展到有十八间房子，二十个工作人员，有八百多人吃饭的大型食堂。她们苦干、巧干，仿制了合面机、洗米机、切菜机、挤馅机等十四种简易炊事工具，安装了硬气锅炉和烤炉。这个食堂主、副食花样多，既有几分钱一盘的大锅菜，也有质量比较高的单炒菜，因而能满足群众的不同需要。对于老年人、孕妇、病人，食堂就注意做一些稀的和软的照顾他们。过年过节，这个食堂还准备了价廉物美的“团结席”、“跃进席”等等。她们每天除去供应八百多个人的饮食以外，还为周围十八个小型食堂加工制做主食，指导、帮助这些小型食堂改进做饭的技术和管理工作，小食堂自己作副食，既便利群众，又能使大、小食堂结合成网成套，大型食堂，或主食加工厂的出现，为食品制作机械化创造了有利的条件。目前不少大型食堂都有了像九道湾食堂这样一些食品加工的机械化设备。过去一家一户至少要占用一个劳动力来做饭，不知道有多少家庭妇女毕生的精力就耗费在这上面，狭小的天地、琐碎的家务劳动，限制了她们在政治上、文化上的开展和提高。现在像九道湾食堂这样二十个人不但作出八百多人的饭菜，而且还能给许多小型食堂作加工主食。相形之下，这是一个多么大的节约！
    服务所、站是把零星家务全面组织起来的新形式
    随着生产的持续跃进，广大街道妇女不但要求解决带孩子、做饭等主要家务的牵累，也迫切要求解决家务琐事的社会化问题。服务所和服务站就是群众自己创造的把零星家务全面组织起来的一种新的形式。这种新型的服务组织现在已经在全市街道上普遍地兴办起来了。他们服务的范围很广，方式灵活，便利群众，一些办得好的单位，还采取了分片服务到户、包揽家务的办法，真正做到了群众需要什么，就作什么。如宣武区椿树胡同人民公社裘家街服务站就是一个例子，他们服务的项目包括拆洗缝补、修理皮鞋、便鞋、家具、接送小孩、照顾病人、产妇、计时托儿、代请医生、代交房租和电费、代办银行储蓄等一百二十多项。最近他们还实行了按户包办家务的办法，洗衣服、补袜子的活这都由服务站包干了；另一种是替夫妇双方都整天工作的职工和干部包办家务琐事，替他们打扫室内清洁卫生、生火炉子、灌暖水瓶、倒垃圾、接送小孩等等。包家务的办法很灵活，既可以全包，也可以包单项。这种服务形式，是由组织主要的家务劳动向进一步地全面地组织人民生活发展的一个很好的形式。广大群众热烈地欢迎这种服务组织，赞扬服务站“想得周到，来得及时，保证生产跃进、生活好。”住在棉花五条的工人家属刘甫全，参加了街道生产，孩子进了幼儿园，全家在大院食堂入伙，拆洗缝补包给裘家街服务站，他总是笑迷迷的对人说：“党全面组织人民生活太好了，我参加了工作，家务事都有人管，我可愉快啦。”生活集体化、家务劳动社会化的优越性不是再明显也没有了么！当然任何事物都有一个从低级到高级的发展过程。我们普遍地办食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业还缺乏经验，有办得很好的，也有办得不够好的。办好食堂、托儿所，不仅是街道妇女的责任，而且是全社会的责任。因为生产和生活是相互促进的，只有更好地组织人民的经济生活，大办集体福利事业和服务事业，才能适应社会主义生产不断发展的需要。恩格斯在一百多年前就曾经说过：“有了公共食堂和公共服务所，从事这一工作的三分之二的人就会很容易的解放出来，而其余的三分之一也能够比现在更好、更专心地完成自己的工作。”恩格斯的预言，在我们这里正在迅速地变成活生生的现实。
    参加社会劳动和集体生活的锻炼，大大改变了家庭妇女们的精神面貌和她们在家庭和社会上的地位。有人认为妇女广泛参加社会劳动，会影响家庭生活的美满，这要看是一种什么样的家庭，妇女参加社会劳动，使封建家长制的家庭关系的残余遭到最彻底的破坏，这种破坏实在是值得广大人民特别是广大妇女欢呼的事情。妇女将不再过寄生生活，不再依赖别人了，这有什么不好？恰恰相反，只有广大妇女广泛地参加了社会劳动和集体生活以后，才能建立起新型的、民主、和睦、平等、互助，有着共同奋斗目标的美好家庭。北新桥针织厂的李桂华，在没参加街道生产以前，家庭不和睦，夫妻婆媳经常吵嘴，自从李桂华参加了街道生产，刻苦钻研，月月超产，提前两个月完成了1959年的全年生产任务，当上了全厂的标兵，思想觉悟提高了，家庭的收入也增加了，这个家庭从此变样了，儿媳妇被公婆看重了，逢夜班天冷，公公送衣服、婆婆送吃的，星期天爱人下了班，亲自来接她去看电影。她和丈夫常常在一起谈跃进计划，谈技术革新，一家人的感情比过去融洽了。现在，千千万万像李桂华这样的新型家庭已经建立起来。在这样的新型家庭里，丈夫不再对妻子说：“你吃着我的面条了”，过去丈夫说：“你懂得什么”。夫妻之间缺乏共同的语言，现在一起谈工作、谈学习、谈国家大事。这样新型的家庭关系正使广大人民和妇女精神更为奋发，劳动热情更为昂扬。
    通过实际锻炼，妇女的政治觉悟和领导能力不断提高
    通过实际的锻炼，妇女们的政治觉悟和领导能力正在不断提高。街道工厂中，就有女厂长六百二十四人，许多妇女担任了食堂、托儿所、服务站的负责人。有二百五十多个街道妇女出席了今年2月召开的全市工业群英会。有三百多个“三八红旗手”和“三八红旗集体”受到全国妇联和市妇联的奖励。二百七十五个街道妇女并且光荣地参加了中国共产党。例如东城区建国门金漆镶嵌厂厂长、共产党员唐淑贞，原来是个家庭妇女，去年3月她领导十四个家庭妇女组成金漆镶嵌小组，现在这个小组已发展成为二百多人的工厂。她在工作中做到了抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，把工厂领导得井井有条，产品产量、质量不断提高。这个厂子今年2月的产量比去年3月提高了十一倍多，出厂的产品质量全部合格，因而被评为北京市的红旗单位和全国三八红旗集体单位。像这样一些先进人物正在不断涌现出来。
    实践证明，只有在社会主义制度下，只有在共产党的领导下，才有可能这样广泛地组织妇女从事社会劳动，大办集体生活福利事业和服务事业，使过去一家一户分散的家务劳动，逐步的社会化、集体化，充分发挥了妇女的才智，使妇女彻底解放，实现真正的男女平等。列宁说：“妇女解放是社会解放的尺度。”妇女精神面貌的改变，也同时促进了整个社会面貌的改变。这个变化所以来得这样迅速，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    大办街道生产，大办集体福利事业，为城市人民公社的建立打下了良好的基础。早在1958年我们就选择了不同类型的地区进行了人民公社的试点工作。经过一年多的试办已经取得了经验，证明城市人民公社也是城市人民组织的最好形式，而城市人民公社的建立又是一次极为深刻的革命，也是广大妇女彻底解放的道路。毛主席曾经指示我们：“只有当阶级社会不存在了，笨重的劳动都自动化了，农业也都机械化了的时候，才能真正实现男女平等。”社会主义社会是共产主义社会的初级阶段，只有在共产主义社会里，才能彻底消灭资产阶级法权的残余，彻底消灭历史上遗留给妇女在政治上、思想上、文化上、工作能力上的一切落后方面，才能彻底完成妇女解放事业。因此我们决不能停滞不前，不能满足于现状，必须坚持不断革命，不断跃进，随着首都社会主义建设事业的发展，把妇女运动继续推向前进。
