    "Little Patient"
    Nai Qing

    The northwest wind howled, and the icy snowflakes stung people's faces. Pedestrians wished they could shrink their heads into their collars. The nursery teacher, Xu Sulan, wasn't wearing a cotton-padded coat herself, but she wrapped something in it, hugging it tightly as she ran home.

    "Mom, Mom," Sulan shouted as she entered the door, "Quick! It's freezing! Is the kang heated?"

    Her mother said with a mix of affection and complaint, "Silly girl, you haven't been home for days, and you only come when it's snowing. Hurry up and get on the kang to warm up!"

    Seeing Sulan holding something in her arms, her mother immediately knew: It must be a little patient. Usually, when any of the factory's female workers' children got sick, Sulan would take care of everything, from seeking medical treatment to administering medicine and injections. On her days off, she would bring the child to her own home and take care of them herself, so that the child wouldn't affect the mother's production or rest. The workshop workers were very satisfied. Now, seeing this scene, her mother habitually went to take the child, but the thing wrapped in the cotton-padded coat hummed twice.

    "Eh! Heavens! Isn't this a child?" her mother asked in surprise.

    "Yes, it's a little patient!" Sulan almost laughed.

    "Doesn't look like it, doesn't look like it," her mother said, pulling open the coat, so frightened that she took a few steps back. "Silly girl, why didn't you say so earlier? Where did this piglet come from?"

    Sulan bent over laughing, and quickly said, "Mom, wrap it up quickly, don't let it freeze. It's sick! I was afraid it would freeze to death at night, so I brought it back."

    "Is the nursery feeding it? Does it not drink milk anymore?"

    "It stopped drinking milk a long time ago. The factory is raising it, there are many of them!" Sulan jumped around like a child, "I'm not a nursery teacher anymore, I've become their feeder!"

    "Ah! Feeder, do you know how?" her mother said worriedly, "This is not like taking care of children!"

    "Don't know! I'll learn! Cleanliness, temperature, hunger, thirst, sickness..."

    "Don't show off, be careful you don't let the pig lose weight."

    "Mom, stop nagging, quickly warm up the piglet, it's so cold that its teeth are chattering!"

    Her mother stroked the smooth, round, black piglet, feeling very sorry for it. She paced around the room a few times, unable to find a place to put this "little patient." Suddenly she said, "I've got it, let's get some firewood and roast it!"

    But Sulan objected, "No, the pig will be scared and run away, and if it gets too close, it will burn its fur."

    Her mother thought for a while and said, "How about this, the stove opening is warm, it was burned at night, there's no fire now."

    "That's even worse, pigs are clean, it won't crawl into the stove opening!"

    Her mother got angry, "My little grandma, raising a piglet is so difficult! This isn't good, that isn't good, why don't you just let it sleep on the kang!"

    Sulan burst into laughter, "Mom, that's right! The piglet is clean and good-looking, and the kang is warm..."

    "Nonsense, who puts pigs on the kang?"

    "Hey, Mom!" Sulan frowned, then said with a smile, "You've forgotten! You put the calf on the kang and covered it with a quilt. Dad even argued with you about it."

    Her mother didn't say anything for the time being. She thought calves were okay to do that with, but pigs were always dirty. She said, "That's a calf, it's not a pig."

    Sulan explained, "Pigs aren't dirty, it depends on how people manage them. The pig is a treasure from head to toe!"

    "I know," her mother said with a long drawl, "Even if it's covered in gold, it's still no good."

    Sulan pretended to be angry, turned her face away and imitated her mother's voice, "Then forget it, throw the pig into the yard."

    Her mother's heart softened, and she pointed at Sulan and said, "Look, you really have the face of a child, with so many tricks! So difficult to deal with, and you want to throw it away, aren't you afraid it will freeze to death?"

    This move hit the mark. Sulan hugged her mother and laughed and said, "Mom is still the best, just put it there for a little while! Once the pig is warmed up, I'll take it down." Saying that, she picked up the piglet and ran to the kang room.

    Her mother didn't stop her, but muttered to herself, "She's really a hollow lotus root, full of holes! She can come up with anything." Then she shouted loudly, "Feel if the kang is still hot, if it's not, burn another handful of rice husks."

    “小病号”
    乃青
    西北风吼叫着，冰冷的雪粒砸得人满脸发疼，行人恨不得把头缩到衣领里。托儿所阿姨徐素兰，自个不穿棉袄，却用它裹着个东西，紧紧搂在怀里往家跑。
    “妈，妈”素兰进门就喊：“快！冻死啦！烧炕了没有？”
    妈又疼又怨说：“傻妮子，多天没回家，专瞅下雪天来，快上炕暖暖吧！”
    见素兰怀里还抱着个东西，妈立刻就知道：准是小病号。平时，厂里哪个女工的孩子得了病，求医、吃药、打针，素兰总要一手经管到底。遇上自个轮休日，就把孩子带到自个家，自个经管，不让孩子影响妈妈生产或休息，车间工人非常满意。现在见这光景，妈习惯地赶紧去接，不料那棉袄里裹的东西哼了两声。
    “咦！天爷！这不是孩子吗？”妈吃惊地问。
    “是，是小病号嘛！”素兰差点要笑出来。
    “不像，不像”妈说着拉开棉袄襟，吓得她倒退几步，“死妮子，不早说，哪来的猪娃？”
    素兰笑弯了腰，忙说：“妈，快裹住，别冻着它。病啦！怕夜里冻死了，我就抱回来了。”
    “是托儿所喂的？不吃奶啦？”
    “早不吃奶啦。这是厂里喂的呀，多得很呢！”素兰孩子似的跳跃着：“我眼下不是阿姨啦，成了它们的饲养员咧！”
    “啊！饲养员，你懂？”妈担心地说：“这可不是带孩子呀！”
    “不懂！学呗！干净，热冷，饥饱渴，病……”
    “瞎逞精，小心把猪喂得跌了膘。”
    “妈，别尽唠叨，赶紧给猪娃暖和暖和，猪娃冻得上牙碰下牙哩！”
    妈抚摸着这黑明光溜、长得滚圆的猪娃，心疼得不行，在屋里打了几个转转，没处安置这“小病号”。忽然她说：“有啦，弄些柴草，给它烤火！”
    素兰却反对：“不行，猪会吓得逃跑，挨近了会把猪毛烧焦的。”
    妈思索一阵说：“这么着，炕洞里暖和，是夜里烧过的，早没火啦”。
    “那更不好，猪爱干净，它才不钻炕洞哩！”
    妈火啦：“我的小奶奶，弄个猪娃再没法敬啦！这不是，那不中，你咋不叫睡在炕上！”
    素兰却哈哈大笑起来：“妈呀，说的是呀！猪娃干净又好看，炕上热呼呼的……”
    “瞎扯，谁家把猪放在炕上？”
    “哎，妈！”素兰眉头一皱，又笑着说：“你倒忘啦！你把牛犊按在炕上，盖上被子。为这，爹还跟你斗气呢。”
    妈暂时没吱声，她认为牛犊就能那样，猪总是脏的。她说：“那是牛犊，就不是猪。”
    素兰解释说：“猪并不脏，在于人经管。猪混身都是宝啊！”
    “知道，”妈声音拖得老长：“就是浑身金子也不行。”
    素兰装着生气，脸一扭学着妈的声音说：“那就算啦，把猪扔到院里吧。”
    妈心软了，指着素兰说：“看，真是娃娃脸儿样样多，暂时没法敬，这就要扔，不怕冻死了？”
    这一军将准了。素兰抱着妈又笑又说：“还是妈好，就放一小会儿吧！猪暖和了就抱下来。”说着抱起小猪就往炕屋跑。
    妈没有阻拦，自言自语说：“真个是空心莲菜，眼眼多！啥门道都使得出。”又高声吆喝道：“摸摸炕还热不热，不热了再烧把谷糠。”
