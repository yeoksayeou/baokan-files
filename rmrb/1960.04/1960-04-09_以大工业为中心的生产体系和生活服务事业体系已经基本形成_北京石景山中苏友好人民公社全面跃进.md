Xinhua News Agency, April 8th. Since its establishment in August 1958, the first urban people's commune in the capital – the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan – under the correct leadership of the Party, has undergone development, consolidation, and improvement. It has now basically formed a production system centered on large-scale industry and a system of living service undertakings, demonstrating unparalleled superiority and vitality.

Shijingshan is a heavy industrial base in Beijing. After ten years of construction and development, it has reached the scale of a medium-sized city and has become a satellite city of the capital.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the industrial and mining enterprises in the Shijingshan area had heavy expansion and construction tasks, requiring a large number of additional laborers, as well as comprehensive arrangements for the production of building materials, factory land, and transportation capacity. At the same time, due to the increasing industrial population, the supply of non-staple foods also needed to be addressed. In agriculture, in order to further increase the yield per unit area of crops and establish a commodity base for non-staple foods, technical support from large-scale industry was also needed. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's material and cultural living standards are constantly improving, and commercial and cultural education undertakings also require unified leadership and comprehensive arrangements. At the same time, after studying the General Line, the families of the staff and workers raised their political awareness and asked to participate in socialist construction. Under this new situation, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee began to organize the families of staff and workers to participate in productive labor in July 1958. In August of the same year, on the eve of the high tide of the people's commune movement in the rural areas, the urban people's commune centered on large state-owned factories – the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan – was formally established under the leadership of the Party organization.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan includes more than ten large state-owned and locally state-owned factories such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Special Steel Plant, as well as the Babao Mountain, Gucheng, Wulituo, and Xihuangcun four agricultural production brigades. Farmers account for about 14% of the total population, while staff and workers, their families, and a small number of employees in commerce, service industries, handicrafts, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings account for about 86%. Since the establishment of the commune, industrial and agricultural production has made continuous leaps forward; the people's economic life has been basically fully organized, and the people's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.

After the establishment of the commune, 6,800 of the 8,800 employable staff and workers' families and idle residents here participated in production and work. Among them, more than 4,500 people went to large factories to participate in production, which not only solved the problem of labor shortage in these factories at that time, but also greatly saved the investment in public welfare facilities such as dormitories, canteens, and hospitals compared with recruiting new workers from society. In the past year, many of these staff and workers' families have become skilled workers, reaching the level of second- or third-grade workers. Guo Yuemin, who works in the coke oven plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, was originally a staff member with six children. Now, she is a worker with a fourth-grade level and two apprentices. Now, this labor army composed of the families of staff and workers has become an indispensable force in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shijingshan Power Plant.

Under the guidance of the principle of serving large-scale industry, the industries run by the commune have relied on their own efforts and given full play to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, and have also developed rapidly in the past year. The commune's forty-one small and medium-sized factories, including more than twenty industries, have become a strong helper to large-scale industry in the Shijingshan area and an important force in transforming agricultural technology. The total output value of the commune-run industries in 1959 also increased from 5.7 million yuan in 1958 to 15.93 million yuan, an increase of 179%. Major factories have given strong support to the commune-run industries and have also done a lot of work in promoting the technological transformation of agriculture. However, the commune-run industries are mainly built up by relying on their own efforts and starting from scratch. Most of the commune-run factories had no funds and no equipment at the beginning, and the workers did not understand technology. The commune members raised funds themselves and learned technology everywhere by using the method of "inviting in and sending out"; if there were no raw materials, they adapted to local conditions and widely opened up sources of raw materials; if there was no equipment, they first used indigenous methods for production. The commune vigorously organized street women to use waste materials from large factories to specialize in producing products needed by large factories, and actively rectified and expanded the small-scale industries run by the original agricultural cooperatives. After a period of arduous entrepreneurial process, the commune-run industries gradually consolidated and developed from small to large.

After the establishment of the commune, agricultural production implemented the principle of taking vegetables and meat as the key, and there was also a leap in development. The output of commercial vegetables increased sharply from 25 million catties in 1958 to 57 million catties in 1959, basically guaranteeing the vegetable supply for the industrial population within the commune. Pigs, chickens, and dairy cows have also increased significantly, and new production departments such as fish farming and duck farming have also been established.

After the vast number of staff and workers' families participated in production, they urgently demanded the organization of collective life and welfare undertakings. At the same time, due to the increase in the number of people participating in production, the purchasing power of the market increased, and it was also required to organize the supply in a planned way. The original state-owned commercial, service industries, and factory welfare departments were far from meeting the needs of the masses. Based on this situation, the commune Party committee unified the original state-owned commercial, service industries, residents' collective welfare undertakings, financial and trade departments, and factory welfare departments belonging to sixteen systems into a People's Economic Life Committee, which unified the leadership of various collective welfare undertakings and commercial departments, and increased and rationally adjusted the network of commercial and service industries, making great changes in the service and supply work in this area. From the establishment of the commune to the end of 1959, the entire commune established a total of 143 canteens, including 114 in rural areas, with the number of households joining the canteens accounting for 93% of the total number of households in rural areas; 29 street canteens, with the number of residents joining the canteens accounting for 46% of the number of people participating in production. The commune established 109 childcare organizations, including 90 in rural areas, with the number of children in childcare accounting for 74% of the children who should be in childcare; 19 street childcare centers, with the number of children in childcare accounting for 31% of the children who should be in childcare, freeing more than 2,800 staff and workers' families from the burden of housework. The commune also established four homes for the elderly, with 49 elderly people admitted; eleven clinics, with 76 medical personnel. All of these have played a significant role in reducing the household burden of commune members and improving the supply of goods.

Service stations are a new development in the commune's collective welfare undertakings. The People's Economic Life Committee has successively established comprehensive service stations, consignment points, sewing departments, barber shops, bookstores, children's activity stations, bicycle and shoe repair shops, television teams, and other repair service points, a total of 75 units, in the concentrated residential areas of family members. There are 38 categories and more than 150 types of service items, including agency purchase, consignment sales, agency services, agency collection, agency work, helping the elderly and the young, taking care of patients, cleaning and sanitation, dismantling, washing and mending, and even collecting rent and distributing coal for factories. The number of households that rely on service stations to solve difficulties has reached 38.3% of the total number of households in concentrated residential areas. "With the service station, everything is convenient, you don't have to worry about anything, and you can devote all your efforts to production," this is the masses' praise for it.

After the establishment of the commune, the worker-peasant alliance was further consolidated and developed. In order to support large-scale industry and develop commune production, they launched large-scale cooperation and mutual assistance. Commune members regarded supporting the production and construction of Shijingshan Iron and Steel and other large factories as the most glorious task. At the most tense moment of transportation tasks, the commune's cars, carts, and tractors took the initiative to support the transportation of large factories. When the blast furnace production urgently needed sand, the commune organized carts overnight to rush to transport it. When Shijingshan Iron and Steel lacked white mud, the commune members went to dig white mud. The staff and workers of large factories, street residents, office cadres, and students here have become a shock force that regularly participates in agricultural labor. The factories have also taken the initiative to repair a large number of agricultural machinery and vehicles for the agricultural production brigades, and have sent technical forces to teach technology to commune members.

The biggest change after the establishment of the commune is the broad masses of women. After they were freed from housework and participated in production, they cultivated a style of loving the collective and loving labor. The social, economic, and political status of women has been greatly improved. After the general staff and workers' families and residents participated in production, the household income has increased significantly. According to a survey of 71 staff and workers' families participating in production, the monthly wage income of staff and workers' families is equal to 47.9% of the income of factory staff and workers in the family. Some families have doubled their income. There is mutual respect and love between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and many new types of harmonious families have emerged. They also participated in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and universally participated in spare-time cultural studies.

    以大工业为中心的生产体系和生活服务事业体系已经基本形成
    北京石景山中苏友好人民公社全面跃进
    开展大规模的协作，工业农业互相支援，共同发展，工人农民之间的友谊更加深厚巩固
    六千我闲散劳力参加生产和工作，社办工业产值一年来增长179％，商品蔬菜增长一倍多
    新华社8日讯　首都的第一个城市人民公社——石景山中苏友好人民公社1958年8月成立以来，在党的正确领导下，经过发展、巩固和提高，现在已经基本上形成了一个以大工业为中心的生产体系和生活服务事业体系，显示了无比的优越性和生命力。
    石景山是北京市的重工业基地。经过十年的建设和发展，这里已经具备了一个中等城市的规模，成为首都的卫星城。
    在1958年的生产大跃进中，石景山地区的工矿企业扩建和新建的任务很重，需要补充大批的劳动力，并且要求全面地安排建筑材料的生产、工厂用地和运输力量。同时由于工业人口日益增加，副食品的供应问题也需要加以解决。农业方面，为了进一步提高农作物的单位面积产量和建立副食品商品基地，也需要大工业的技术支援。随着工农业生产的发展，人民的物质文化生活水平日益提高，商业和文化教育事业也要求统一领导，全面安排。与此同时，职工家属经过总路线的学习，提高了政治觉悟，纷纷要求参加社会主义建设事业。在这种新的形势下，中共石景山钢铁公司党委会就在1958年7月开始组织职工家属参加生产劳动。同年8月，在全国农村人民公社运动高潮的前夕，以国营大工厂为中心的城市人民公社——石景山中苏友好人民公社，就在党组织的领导下正式成立。
    石景山中苏友好人民公社包括石景山钢铁公司、石景山发电厂、特殊钢厂等十多个国营、地方国营大工厂和八宝山、古城、五里坨、西黄村四个农业生产大队。总人口中农民占14％左右，职工和职工家属以及少数商业、服务业、手工业、文教卫生事业的从业人员占86％左右。公社建立以后，工农业生产连续大跃进；人民经济生活基本上全面地组织起来，人们的精神面貌已经发生了深刻的变化。
    公社成立以后，这里的八千八百名有劳动能力的职工家属和闲散居民中，有六千八百人参加了生产和工作。其中有四千五百多人到大工厂参加生产，不但解决了这些工厂当时劳动力不足的问题，而且比从社会上招收新工人还大大节省了宿舍、食堂、医院等公共福利设施的投资。这些职工家属参加生产一年来，有不少人已经成为熟练工人，达到了二、三级工的水平。在石景山钢铁公司焦化厂工作的郭月敏，原来是有六个孩子的职工家属，目前已经是一个具有四级工水平并且带着两个徒工的工人。现在，这支由职工家属组成的劳动大军，在石景山钢铁公司和石景山发电厂已经成为一支不可缺少的力量。
    公社办的工业在为大工业服务的方针指导下，自力更生，发挥了苦干、实干、巧干的精神，一年来也有飞速的发展。公社的包括二十多个行业的四十一个中小工厂，成为石景山地区大工业的有力助手和改造农业技术的重要力量。1959年社办工业的总产值，也由1958年的五百七十万元增长到一千五百九十三万元，增长了179％。各大工厂对社办工业都给予了有力的支援，并且在促进农业技术改造方面也做了许多工作。但是，社办工业主要还是自力更生，白手起家办起来的。大多数社办工厂开始时都是一无资金，二无设备，工人也不懂技术。社员们就自己凑集资金，并且用“请进来，派出去”的办法到处去学习技术；没有原料，他们就因地制宜，广泛开辟原料来源；没有设备，他们就先用土法生产，公社大力组织街道妇女利用大工厂的废旧物资专门生产大工厂所需要的产品，并且积极整顿扩大原有农业社举办的小型工业。经过了一段艰苦的创业过程以后，社办工业就逐步由小到大地巩固和发展起来。
    公社成立以后，农业生产贯彻了以菜、肉为纲的方针，也有了飞跃的发展。商品蔬菜的产量由1958年的二千五百万斤猛增到1959年的五千七百万斤，基本上保证了公社范围内工业人口的蔬菜供应。猪、鸡、奶牛也显著增加，还举办了养鱼、养鸭等新的生产部门。
    广大职工家属参加生产以后，迫切要求组织集体生活福利事业，同时，由于参加生产的人增多，市场购买力增加，也要求有计划地组织供应。原有的国营商业、服务业和工厂生活福利部门已经远不能满足群众的需要。公社党委根据这一情况，就把原来分属十六个系统的国营商业、服务业、居民集体福利事业、财贸部门和工厂生活福利部门统一组成一个人民经济生活委员会，统一领导各种集体福利事业和商业部门，并且增加和合理地调整了商业、服务业的网点，使这个地区的服务、供应工作大大改观。从公社成立到1959年底，全公社共建立了食堂一百四十三个，其中农村一百一十四个，入伙户数占农村总户数的93％；街道食堂二十九个，入伙居民占参加生产人数的46％。公社建立了托儿组织一百零九个，其中农村九十个，入托儿童占应托儿童的74％；街道托儿所十九个，入托儿童占应托儿童的31％，为二千八百多户职工家属解除了家务劳动的牵累。公社还举办了敬老院四所，入院老人四十九人；十一个医务所，有医护人员七十六人。所有这些，对于减轻社员的家务负担，改善商品供应情况起了极大的作用。
    服务站是公社集体福利事业的新发展。人民经济生活委员会在家属集中居住区先后建立了综合性服务站、代销点、缝纫部、理发部、书店、儿童活动站、修车修鞋点、电视队及其他修理服务点共七十五个单位。服务项目有三十八类一百五十多种，包括代购、代销、代办、代收、代做、扶老携幼、照顾病人、清洁卫生、拆洗缝补，直到为工厂代收房租、配煤等等。依靠服务站解决困难的户数已达集中居住区总户数的38.3％。“有了服务站，样样都方便，诸事不操心，全力为生产”，这就是群众对它的赞歌。
    公社成立以后，工农联盟更加巩固和发展了。为了支援大工业和发展公社生产，他们展开了大规模的协作和互助。社员们把支援石钢和其它大工厂的生产建设，当作最光荣的任务。在运输任务最紧张的时刻，公社的汽车、大车、拖拉机主动地去支援大工厂运输。当高炉生产急需砂子的时候，公社就连夜组织大车去抢运，石钢缺白泥，社员们就去挖白泥。大工厂的职工、街道居民、机关干部以及这里的学生，已经成为经常参加农业劳动的一支突击力量。工厂又主动为农业生产大队修复了大量农业机械、车辆，还派了技术力量去向社员传授技术。
    公社成立后变化最大的是妇女群众。她们摆脱了家务劳动参加生产以后，培养了爱集体、爱劳动的风气。妇女的社会经济和政治地位大大提高了。一般职工家属和居民参加生产以后，家庭收入都有显著的提高。据参加生产的七十一个职工家属的调查，职工家属每月工资的收入等于家庭中工厂职工收入的47.9％。有的家庭收入增加了一倍。夫妻之间，婆媳之间互敬互爱，出现了很多新型的和睦家庭。她们还参加了技术革新和技术革命运动，并且普遍参加了业余文化学习。
