Comrade Representatives:

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will briefly discuss the situation of the great movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's writings in Henan.

Henan, like all parts of the country, in implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and on the basis of opposing rightism, boosting morale, and launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, has not only seen a new situation of comprehensive and sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, but also has set off a new upsurge in the mass movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. According to statistics, more than 470,000 state cadres and intellectuals, more than 1,100,000 workers, and more than 12,480,000 peasants in the province have participated in the study. In January and February of this year, the province sold 12,190,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works, and Xinhua bookstores in various places experienced stockouts; the number of publications of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's works and various newspapers and magazines has also greatly increased. Such a study movement, its scale, momentum, and speed of action are unprecedented.

In this movement, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres for learning is unprecedentedly high. They have set plans, expressed their determination, and put forward proposals, quickly setting off a high tide of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" in the learning competition. New atmospheres of racing against time, reading with books in hand, studying diligently, and delving into hard work have appeared everywhere. Many cadres have loudly proposed: "Work and rest, carry books and newspapers with you, take the time to read a few pages, race against every second, think about problems while walking, and talk to each other when meeting." This fully demonstrates their high enthusiasm for learning. The broad masses of workers and peasants have also carried forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, broken superstitions, generally demanded to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, tried every means to seize time, squeeze time, and consciously used the gap between production to carry out collective and individual study. The workers and peasants are the most practical. Their study of theory is not for window dressing, but closely serves the current class struggle and production and construction. They closely integrate theory with practice. For example, the peasants of the Mawan Brigade of the Yuantan People's Commune in Tanghe County adopted the method of "four follows" in studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, that is: "Study follows the central task, debate follows the thinking, self-study and discussion follows the production gap, and books follow the person." In this way, they completely unified study and production. In this study upsurge, many advanced units and model figures have also emerged. They worked day and night, studied hard, and often in the case of insufficient teaching and guidance forces, they still studied diligently and persisted unremittingly. For example, workers in Zhengzhou State Cotton Mill No. 3 and Luoyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Plant and peasants in Sanguanmiao Brigade of Ludian Commune in Dengfeng County, Dongcun Brigade of Dongcun People's Commune in Lushan County, and Mawan Brigade of Yuantan Commune in Tanghe County have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works for two years as one day since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Sha Weide, a worker at Zhengzhou State Cotton Mill No. 3, used the guiding ideology of Chairman Mao's works to write more than sixty poems and essays in just three months. Even Niu Yunqing, an old lady over sixty years old in Dongcun Brigade of Dongcun Commune in Lushan County, despite her low cultural level and poor eyesight, has studied more than twenty articles by Chairman Mao in the past two years. These countless vivid advanced examples fully show that the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works has formed a surging upsurge among the broad masses of working people. There is no doubt that this has played an immeasurable and huge role in improving the theoretical level of cadres, promoting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, and promoting the leap forward development of various tasks.

Originally, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works are the theoretical basis for the Party's formulation of various policies and guidelines. Taking the "three magic weapons" of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, they are all products of Mao Zedong Thought and are brilliant examples of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism specifically in the Chinese revolution and construction. The victory of the "three magic weapons" is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. Only by studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works well can we understand the "three magic weapons" and the Party's various policies and guidelines more deeply and comprehensively, and implement them more consciously and resolutely. In fact, through study, the vast number of cadres and the masses have broadened their horizons and liberated their minds more clearly. They have realized that the socialist construction must develop our country's social productive forces at a high speed, that objective laws can be recognized and mastered, and that people can transform the world. Therefore, they have fully developed their subjective initiative, boosted their morale, and promoted the development of technological innovation, technological revolution, and the sustained Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. They are indeed studying and using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as an ideological weapon to solve practical problems in production and various tasks, and have achieved remarkable results. For example, the production of Zhengzhou State Cotton Mill No. 5 used to rank fourth among the six yarn mills in Zhengzhou. However, after studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," they found that the main contradiction of the factory's low productivity was the lack of shuttles and the low technical level of workers. Therefore, they proposed to take the shuttle as the key, strengthen shuttle management, improve the technical level of workers, and other measures. Now, great changes have taken place in all aspects of the factory. The proportion of high-quality yarn ranks first among Zhengzhou factories, and the quality of cloth ranks second in the province. For example, after studying "On Contradiction," Tieshan Mining Plant in Lushan County found that the main contradiction that ore could not be transported out was that loading and unloading could not keep up. Therefore, the worker Ma Renzhen created a rapid loading and unloading machine, which solved the problem. And so on, there are many typical examples on all fronts. Marx's saying that "once theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes a material force" has been fully proved before our eyes.

The emergence of the new upsurge of the mass movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works is by no means accidental. The rapid development of socialist revolution and construction in our country, especially the great victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as well as the rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, last year's anti-rightist, boosting morale, carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and the socialist and communist education movement, have made the vast number of cadres and workers and peasants increasingly deeply realize the urgency and importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works from practice. Our Party has always attached importance to the eager learning requirements of the vast number of cadres and the masses, and has often carried out Marxist-Leninist propaganda and education to them. Therefore, at the same time as the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, a mass theoretical study movement centered on studying Chairman Mao's works appeared in many factories and rural areas in our province. In recent years, the theoretical team has gradually formed and continuously expanded. At present, there are 1,436 full-time theoretical teachers and 8,447 part-time theoretical teachers in the province. In Xuchang and Kaifeng alone, there are 259 full-time theoretical teachers and 24,349 part-time theoretical teachers. Many factories, people's communes, and production brigades in the province are equipped with full-time or part-time theoretical teachers. Some counties have begun to form a theoretical education network from the county to the commune and production team, which has played a great role in studying Chairman Mao's works.

In short, the mass movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works is the inevitable product of the continuous leap forward of social and historical development and socialist construction in our country. The result of the continued, widespread, in-depth, and sustained development of this movement will inevitably make the political and ideological consciousness and theoretical level of the broad masses of people improve more rapidly, and become a great driving force for promoting the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country and the future transition to communism.

    河南工农群众热心学习毛主席著作
    嵇文甫代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和人大常委的几个报告，现在仅就学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作这一伟大运动在河南开展的情况简单谈一谈：
    河南和全国各地一样，在贯彻执行党的八届八中全会精神和反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的基础上，不仅出现了工农业生产全面持续跃进的新局面，而且掀起了学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作的群众性运动的新高潮。据统计，全省已经参加学习的国家干部和知识分子四十七万余人，工人一百一十余万人，农民一千二百四十八万人。在今年元、2月份，全省销售毛主席著作达一千二百一十九万册，各地新华书店都出现了脱销现象；马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作和各种报刊杂志的发行数量也都大大增加。像这样一种学习运动，其规模之大，声势之壮，行动之快，都是从来所没有的。
    在这一运动中，广大干部的学习情绪空前高涨，纷纷订计划、表决心，提倡议，迅速掀起了“学、比、赶、帮”的学习竞赛高潮，到处出现了分秒必争，手不释卷，认真读书，刻苦钻研的新气象。许多干部响亮地提出：“工作和休息，书报带身边，抽空看几页，分秒争时间，走路想问题，相见就交谈。”这充分表现了他们高度的学习劲头。广大工人农民也发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，破除迷信，普遍要求学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，千方百计抢时间，挤时间，自觉地利用生产间隙进行集体和个人的学习。工农群众是最讲实际的，他们学习理论不是为了装璜门面，而是紧紧地服务于当前的阶级斗争和生产建设。他们理论紧密结合实际。如唐河县源潭人民公社马弯大队农民群众学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作采取了“四跟”的方法，即：“学习跟着中心工作走，辩论跟着思想走，自学讨论跟着生产空隙走，书本跟着人走。”这样他们就把学习和生产完全统一了起来。在这个学习高潮中，还涌现了许多先进单位和模范人物，他们废寝忘食，苦钻苦学，往往在教学辅导力量不足的情况下，仍然发奋读书，坚持不懈。如郑州国棉三厂、洛阳有色金属加工厂的工人和登封县卢店公社三官庙大队、鲁山县董村人民公社董村大队、唐河县源潭公社马弯大队等地农民，自1958年大跃进以来，坚持学习毛主席著作两年如一日。郑州国棉三厂工人沙威德，在短短的三个月中，用毛主席著作的指导思想，写出诗歌论文六十余篇。甚至像鲁山县董村公社董村大队年过花甲的老太太牛运卿，在文化水平不高、视力较差的情况下，两年来，也学习毛主席著作二十余篇。这些无数生动的先进事例，充分表明学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作已经在广大劳动人民中间形成了汹涌澎湃的热潮。毫无疑义，这对于提高干部的理论水平，促进广大人民的革命干劲，推动各项工作的飞跃发展，起到了无可估量的巨大作用。
    本来，马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作是党制订各项方针政策的理论基础。拿总路线、大跃进、人民公社“三大法宝”来说，都是毛泽东思想的产物，是创造性地把马克思列宁主义具体运用在中国革命和建设中的光辉范例。“三大法宝”的胜利，也就是毛泽东思想的胜利，马克思列宁主义的胜利。只有好好学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作，才能对“三大法宝”，对党的各项方针政策理解得更加深入和全面，贯彻执行也就更加自觉和坚决。事实上，广大干部和人民群众通过学习，眼界更加开阔，思想更加解放，更清楚地认识到建设社会主义必须高速度地发展我国的社会生产力，认识到客观规律是可以被认识和掌握的，人可以改造世界；因而充分发挥了主观能动性，鼓足了干劲，促进了技术革新、技术革命的发展和工农业生产的持续大跃进。他们也确实在学习运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作这一思想武器，来解决生产上和各种工作中的实际问题，得到显著的成效。如郑州国棉五厂的生产，过去在郑州六个纱厂中名列第四。可是在学习毛主席的“矛盾论”以后，他们找出厂里生产率低的主要矛盾，在于梭子少，工人技术水平不高，于是提出了以梭为纲，加强梭子保管，提高工人技术水平，还有其它一些措施，到现在，该厂各方面起了很大变化，优质纱的比重占郑州各厂第一，布的质量成为全省第二。又如，鲁山县铁山采矿厂，学习了“矛盾论”以后，找出矿石运不出去的主要矛盾，在于装卸跟不上，于是工人马仁真创造了一个快速装卸机，把问题解决了。如此等等，在各个战线上典型事例很多。马克思所谓“理论一旦掌握群众，便变成物质力量”，在我们眼前又得到充分的证明。
    学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作群众运动新高潮的出现，决不是偶然的。我国社会主义革命和建设的迅速发展，特别是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，以及经过1957年整风反右派斗争，去年反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动和社会主义、共产主义教育运动，使广大干部和工农群众，从实践中越来越深刻地体会到学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作的迫切性和重要性。我们党一贯重视广大干部和人民群众这种如饥如渴的学习要求，经常地向他们进行了马克思列宁主义的宣传教育。因此，在1958年工农业生产大跃进的同时，我省不少工厂和农村就出现了一个以学习毛主席著作为中心的群众性的理论学习运动。几年来理论队伍已经逐渐形成和不断扩大，目前我省在职干部的专职理论教员一千四百三十六人，兼职理论教员八千四百四十七人；许昌、开封两地即有工农专职理论教员二百五十九人，兼职理论教员二万四千三百四十九人。全省许多工厂、人民公社、生产大队配备了专职或兼职理论教员。有的县从县到公社、生产队开始形成理论教育网，在学习毛主席著作中起了很大作用。
    总之，学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作的群众运动，是我国社会历史发展和社会主义建设持续跃进的必然产物。这一运动继续广泛深入持久发展的结果，必将使广大人民群众的政治思想觉悟水平和理论水平更加迅速提高，成为推动我国社会主义建设高速度发展和将来过渡到共产主义的伟大动力。
