How I Shape the Image of Lenin
Russian Federation People's Artist Zhukov

When I first represented Lenin in my artwork, for a long time, my paintings imitated others and lacked creativity. I had never seen Lenin, and could only understand his image based on the memories of his comrades, friends, and relatives, as well as photographs, documentaries, and some sculptures.

After studying the images of Lenin painted by various artists and observing many actors playing Lenin, I came to the conclusion that some works of plastic art and stage performances were too naturalistic. I had this problem myself.

Once, I painted a picture showing Lenin participating in voluntary labor. When painting the model, I tried to find the most beautiful movement when carrying a log. Many attempts did not achieve the desired effect. Later, after a great deal of effort, I finally found the most ideal posture. I felt that this posture realistically represented the natural state of people carrying logs. To check the effect of the work, I showed the painting to my friends. Everyone felt that the log in the painting was too big and too heavy for Lenin to carry. It would be best to make the wood smaller. After listening to these opinions, I picked up the eraser and reduced the weight of the log as if I were planing wood. Then I showed it to the audience again and asked them for their opinions on the painting. However, everyone still gave me the same opinion. I tried to defend my painting, emphasizing that the posture was natural and that Lenin was very strong. But no one agreed with me, and everyone insisted on reducing the size of the log in the picture. I had to reduce the log again, greatly reducing the weight. Even so, some people still doubted: "Isn't it too heavy?" Without waiting for my answer, they said affirmatively: "It seems too heavy, no, no." At this time, I understood that the audience raised these opinions not because the log was really too big, but because they all sincerely loved Lenin and felt sorry to see Lenin carrying something very heavy.

I reread the memoirs about voluntary labor in the Kremlin several times. One thing caught my attention. Lenin came out of the People's Committee building and saw people lined up, preparing to participate in voluntary labor. He asked the guard captain to allow him to stand in the queue of the masses. The captain asked Lenin to stand at the front of the line. So, I seemed to see Lenin standing in a line with the people, carrying shovels, pickaxes, and iron bars, and following their leader forward. Behind this voluntary labor team was the ancient Kremlin. I suddenly felt enlightened. Both the theme of voluntary labor and new, more vivid things could be handled in this way. The previous treatment was naturalistic and superficial.

After thinking of a subject, it is very important to consider it carefully in advance, both technically and in terms of ideological content, and arrange it like a director.

Once, a delegate to the Third Congress of the Communist Youth League told me the following story. This happened during the congress. Lenin's speech ended. People raised some questions for Lenin to answer. A young man from a distant rural area asked a question. He asked where he could buy pine tar for cart wheels, as pine tar was particularly scarce in the countryside. Asking such a question to the great revolutionary leader at such a solemn evening made people feel embarrassed. Many people laughed and said, "Look at what you're asking." At this time, Lenin made a gesture to stop the laughter. Lenin said that this was a very good and reasonable question, and it was indeed a question of essence for the rural areas devastated by the war. He asked the young people: "If the carts that are so needed in the economic life of the peasants stop, can the wheels of the revolution that we talk about and care about every day rotate smoothly?"

In this wonderful contrast, what a reasonable connection Lenin revealed! The atmosphere in the hall changed instantly, and people felt how amiable Lenin was.

This is why the memories of Lenin by workers, especially workers and peasants, are most interesting to readers and provide rich material for painters.

After understanding similar materials, it is not difficult to imagine Lenin's situation in daily life. In this way, I thought of several more themes, namely: "Sharp Weapon", "The Story of Budyonny's Cavalry", and "Tender Shoots". When dealing with the theme of "Tender Shoots", I used the effect of scenery: spring, Lenin in the environment of nature. The tender shoots of grass and trees made Lenin desire the revolutionary seedlings of the future. I think this approach can convey the painter's concept to the audience.

In plastic art, the image of Lenin shaped by artists is mostly that of a passionate political commentator and leader of the proletarian revolution. These themes often require the author to adopt exaggeration techniques, adopt the epitome of posters, and require the author to express the image magnificently. However, when you read the memoirs of Lenin's relatives, close associates, and comrades-in-arms, you are amazed by his unusually profound wisdom and lovely image, his simple style, noble morality, and impeccable character.

In the 1940s, when I first started creating the image of Lenin, I had only one small wish, to complete a few paintings depicting Lenin. Now, after creating dozens of paintings depicting Lenin, my ideas are increasing year by year. I believe that an artist cannot finish painting the themes of the great leader of the working people in his lifetime.

### 我怎样塑造列宁的形象

    我怎样塑造列宁的形象	俄罗斯联邦人民美术家　茹可夫
    当我最初在美术作品中表现列宁的时候，在很长时间内，我的画总是因袭他人，没有创造性。我没有看见过列宁，只能根据他的战友、朋友和亲人的回忆，根据照片、纪录片和一些雕塑来了解列宁的形象。
    研究各个画家画的列宁的形象，观察许多演员扮演的列宁，我得出一个结论：某些造型艺术作品和舞台表演，自然主义的气味太重。我自己也有这个毛病。
    有一次，我画一张表现列宁参加义务劳动的画。在画模特的时候，我尽量寻找扛圆木时最优美的动作。许多尝试，都没有得到预期的效果。后来，费了九牛二虎之力，才算找到最理想的姿势。我觉得，这个姿势真实地表现了人们扛圆木时自然的状态。为了检查作品的效果，我把画拿给朋友们看。所有的人都觉得画上的圆木太大，列宁扛起来太重，最好把木头画小一些。听了这些意见，我拿起橡皮，就像拿刨子刨木头一样，把圆木的份量减轻了。然后再拿给观众看，请他们对这幅画提意见。可是，大家仍然给我提出了同样的意见。我企图为我的画辩护，我强调说明这个姿势是自然的，强调说明列宁的体力很大。可是谁也不同意我的说法，每个人都坚持要缩小画面上的圆木。只好再一次缩小圆木，大大减轻重量。即使这样，还有人怀疑：“不太重吗？”不等我回答，他们就肯定地说：“似乎太重，不行，不行。”这时我明白了，观众所以提出这些意见，不是因为圆木真的太大，而是因为他们都衷心爱戴列宁，看到列宁扛很重的东西，心里觉得过意不去。
    关于在克里姆林宫进行义务劳动的回忆录，我再次读了几遍。一件事吸引了我的注意。列宁从人民委员会大楼出来，看见人们排成队，准备去参加义务劳动。他要求警卫队长允许他站到群众的队列中去。队长请列宁站到排头。于是，我好像亲眼看见列宁跟人们站在一个行列里，人们扛着铁锹、镐头和铁棍，跟着自己的领袖前进。这支义务劳动队伍的背后是古老的克里姆林宫。我心里豁然开朗了，无论是义务劳动的题材，还是新的、更形象的东西，都可以这样处理。而从前的处理是自然主义的，肤浅的。
    想到一个题材以后，不论从技术上，还是从思想内容上，事前都要考虑周到，像导演似地把它安排好。这是十分重要的。
    有一次，共青团第三次代表大会的一位代表对我讲了下面一段故事。这件事发生在大会进行期间。列宁的演讲结束了。人们提出一些问题请列宁解答。一个来自远方的农村小伙子提了一个问题。他问，什么地方可以买到上车轱辘的松焦油，乡下特别缺少松焦油。在那么庄严的晚会上，对伟大的革命领袖提出这样的问题，使人感到窘促。许多人大笑起来，并说，看你问些什么。这时，列宁作了一个手势，阻止了笑声。列宁说，这是一个很好的、很合乎情理的问题，对于受到战争破坏的农村来说，这确是一个有本质意义的问题。他向青年们问道：如果在农民的经济生活中那么需要的大车都停了下来，我们每天谈论，每天关怀的革命车轮还能顺利地旋转吗？
    在这个绝妙的对比中，列宁揭示了一个多么合情合理的联系啊！大厅里的气氛顿时改变了，人们感到列宁多么和蔼可亲。
    这就是劳动者，特别是工人和农民关于列宁的回忆最能引起读者的兴趣，最能为画家提供丰富材料的原因。
    了解了类似的材料，就不难想像出列宁在日常生活中的情景。这样，我又想到几个题材，即：“犀利的武器”、“关于布琼尼骑兵的故事”、“嫩芽”。处理“嫩芽”这个题材时，我运用了风景的效果：春天，列宁在大自然的环境里。草木的嫩芽使列宁产生了对于未来的革命幼苗的想望。我想，这种处理方法是可以把画家的构思传达给观众的。
    在造型艺术中，美术家塑造的列宁的形象，大多是热烈的政论家和无产阶级革命的领袖。这些题材常常要求作者采用夸张手法，采用招贴画的缩影法，要求作者把形象表现得雄伟。但是，当你阅读列宁的亲人、近人和战友们的回忆录时，看到他那异常渊深的智慧和可爱的形象，看到他那淳朴的作风、高尚的道德和完美无缺的性格，简直使你惊讶。
    在四十年代，当我刚刚开始创造列宁的形象的时候，我只有一个小的愿望，即完成几幅表现列宁的画。现在，当我创作了几十幅表现列宁的画以后，我的构思一年比一年多了。我认为要创造劳动人民伟大领袖的题材，一个美术家一生也画不完。
