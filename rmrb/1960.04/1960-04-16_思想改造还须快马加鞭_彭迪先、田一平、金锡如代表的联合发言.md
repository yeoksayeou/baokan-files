We wholeheartedly endorse the two reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council. From these two reports, we are very excited to see the brilliant achievements our great motherland has made in socialist construction last year, and the even more glorious and splendid prospects displayed in this year's national economic plan.

Over the past year or so, the upper and middle-level old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles we have come into contact with, under the leadership and education of the Party, have been encouraged by the excellent situation. On the basis of the great victory of the anti-Rightist rectification campaign, they have participated in the practice of socialist construction, plunged into the torrent of mass movements, and after labor training, educational revolution, and the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, their ideological awareness has been further improved. They have realized the wisdom and greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, the correctness of the Party's line, principles, and policies, and have personally witnessed the infinite wisdom and great strength of the workers and peasants, as well as their boundless loyalty to the Party and their soaring enthusiasm for the socialist cause. This has stimulated and enhanced the old intellectuals' consciousness of actively serving and strengthening their remolding. Significant achievements have been made in both service and remolding. Especially regarding the leadership of the Party, those who were relatively progressive originally have moved closer to the Party; most people have further understanding, some recognizing that "nothing can be accomplished without the leadership of the Party," believing that "the Party can not only lead politics and economy, but also culture, education, and science and technology," and that "it can lead not only in principles and policies, but also in specific issues very well." Due to the improvement of understanding, their views and relationships with grassroots Party organizations have changed compared to before, and more and more people are moving closer to the Party organization, some even gloriously joining the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the Party's line, principles, and policies, most people recognize that the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the three magic weapons for building socialism, and express that they will use the spirit of the General Line to demand themselves, as a guideline for work and thought. They also have more experience and understanding of the Party's educational policy. Many people have put down their airs and worked with the masses, going to factories and the countryside, and using their practical actions to implement the Party's educational policy. In terms of self-remolding, many people feel that "the situation is developing very quickly, and we must speed up our remolding." Some who were unwilling to talk about their thoughts before are now telling the Party the truth and actively seeking the Party's education and the help of the masses. Regarding service, many are willing to "contribute a brick or a stone to the socialist mansion." Those who were energetic originally are even more energetic; those who were not energetic enough have also changed; and some have even made significant achievements. Facts show that, over the past year or so, the political and ideological situation and service attitude of our upper and middle-level old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles have undergone great changes. Especially in accepting the leadership of the Party, the change is even more significant compared to the situation before the anti-Rightist rectification campaign, when most people sympathized with and echoed the Rightists, and seriously swayed to the right. At present, some people have basically shifted from the capitalist standpoint to the socialist standpoint; most people have taken a big step to the left, with the socialist side gradually increasing and the capitalist side gradually decreasing; a few have stagnated and basically remained unchanged. This shows that most people have taken a big step forward on the road from capitalism to socialism, from bourgeois intellectuals to working-class intellectuals.

On the other hand, we must also fully recognize that the great progress of the upper and middle-level old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles is in comparison to our own situation more than a year ago. If we consider the fundamental transformation of bourgeois intellectuals, especially compared to the current Great Leap Forward situation, our progress not only seems very insufficient, but also there are still many problems in our self-remolding and service attitude. For example, regarding the leadership of the Party, some people say in words that the Party can lead science and technology, but in their hearts, they think "I still have my own way," overestimating themselves and exaggerating their personal role. Some people confess their thoughts to the Party on the one hand, but have doubts in their hearts on the other. Many people are superficially obedient to the young leaders of the grassroots Party organizations, but not convinced in their hearts. Regarding the Party's principles and policies, they accept what they agree with, and superficially support what they disagree with, but their thinking is not clear. Regarding the "three long lives," they understand the principles, but not completely in practice, especially when it comes to personal issues, they seem even more unconvinced, thus showing varying degrees of doubt and wavering, some even resisting or being dissatisfied. Regarding the Great Leap Forward, some people still feel passive; they are doing the work, but always want to "take a breath." Some people are not determined in their self-remolding, or feel tired of it. There is a tendency to emphasize professional work and neglect politics, relaxing remolding. With the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution, the struggle between the two roads, two viewpoints, and two methods in teaching and scientific research becomes more and more prominent. Especially in educational thought and academic viewpoints, some of the problems reflected still have differences with the Party. The above situations fully show that over the past year or so, the old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles have made great progress, but there are still many problems, and most people still have two-sidedness and repetitiveness, and must continue to strengthen remolding under the leadership and education of the Party, and in active service.

Facts have also proved that the most fundamental reason why our upper and middle-level old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles have been able to make achievements in service, make progress in remolding, and take a big step forward in repeated twists and turns is that they have accepted the leadership and education of the Party to varying degrees. The problems that exist at present mainly occur in accepting the leadership of the Party. Therefore, accepting the leadership of the Party is a fundamental and key issue for the service and remolding of our upper and middle-level old intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles. In the future, in order to further improve service and promote remolding, we must comprehensively and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party.

What is comprehensively and sincerely accepting the leadership of the Party? We have learned that:

To comprehensively and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, we must earnestly study and strive to implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and resolutely struggle against all thoughts, words, and deeds that deviate from the Party's leadership and violate the Party's line, principles, and policies. At the same time, relying on the leadership of the Party, we must give play to our initiative and active spirit, not wait and rely, but take the initiative to ask the Party for instructions and report, try every means to overcome all difficulties, implement the Party's instructions and intentions, and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

To comprehensively and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, we must resolutely accept the leadership of the higher-level Party committee and resolutely accept the leadership of the grassroots Party organization. The Party's line, principles, and policies are implemented through the Party's grassroots organizations. Therefore, only by earnestly accepting the leadership of the grassroots Party organization can we ensure that the Party's leadership is implemented. Accepting the leadership of the Party must not be different from person to person. Some people often do not want to accept it because the person in charge of the grassroots Party organization is their student or relatively young. This is an extremely serious obstacle to our service and remolding, and must be resolutely overcome.

To comprehensively and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, we must also resolutely overcome our half-heartedness towards the Party, and be of one heart with the Party. Resolutely listening to the Party, listening to Chairman Mao, and following the socialist road unswervingly will gradually cultivate the feelings of loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving socialism, which can become the driving force for our active service and strengthened remolding. To truly be of one heart with the Party and cultivate the ideological feelings of loving the Party and Chairman Mao, we need to establish a proletarian world outlook, resolutely overcome bourgeois individualism, adhere to the fundamental principle of everything serving the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, and focus on the interests of the country and the people, leaning towards the side of socialism. We know that the Party is the concentrated representative of the interests of the people. As long as we focus on the interests of the people, we can be connected with the Party by flesh and blood, share the same breath, and share the same destiny, cultivating the ideological feelings of loving the Party and Chairman Mao.

To comprehensively and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, we must clearly recognize the law of social development that capitalism is bound to perish and socialism and communism are bound to win. Only by following this law and following the Party to take the road of socialism and communism can we control our own destiny. Countless facts have proved that the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao has enabled our country's revolution and construction to achieve unprecedented brilliant achievements. On the road of advancement, only by relying on the working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, and absolutely obeying the leadership of the Party, can we have a bright future.

The great victory of our country's revolution and construction is the victory of strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. In the final analysis, it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is a brilliant example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and is a major development of Marxism-Leninism. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the upsurge of the broad masses in studying Chairman Mao's works, deeply understand and correctly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and implement Mao Zedong Thought into practice, as the criteria for our service and remolding. In this way, we can correctly grasp the Party's line, principles, and policies, eliminate various doubts, completely overcome bourgeois educational thoughts and academic viewpoints, correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, establish the idea of absolute obedience to the leadership of the Party, cultivate the ideological feelings of loving the Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen the transformation of our political stand and world outlook, and advance along the bright road of being both red and expert.

Fellow representatives, this year is the third year of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the socialist construction of our great motherland. Our various undertakings are continuing to leap forward on the basis of achieving a good start this year. Such an excellent situation further encourages us to forge ahead courageously. We must, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, continue to go all out, aim high, set great ambitions, climb to new peaks, dedicate outstanding achievements to the heroes' meeting on the cultural and educational front, and contribute all our strength to the victorious completion of the 1960 national economic plan.

    思想改造还须快马加鞭
    彭迪先、田一平、金锡如代表的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理代表国务院向大会所作的两个报告。从这两个报告中，我们很兴奋地看到，我们伟大祖国在去年的社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就和在今年的国民经济计划中所展现出的更加光辉灿烂的美景。
    一年多来，我们所接触的文教界上中层旧知识分子，在党的领导和教育下受到大好形势的鼓舞，在反右整风运动取得伟大胜利的基础上，参加了社会主义建设实践，投入了群众运动的洪流，经过劳动锻炼、教育革命和党的八届八中全会文件的学习，思想觉悟又有提高；认识到党和毛主席领导的英明伟大，党的路线、方针和政策的正确，并且亲眼看到工农群众的无穷智慧和伟大力量以及他们对党的无限忠诚和对社会主义事业的冲天干劲，从而激发并提高了旧知识分子积极服务、加强改造的自觉，在服务和改造方面都取得了显著的成绩。特别是对党的领导，原来比较进步的一部分人，更加靠拢党了；多数人也有了进一步的认识，有的人认识到“离开了党的领导就会一事无成”，相信“党不但能领导政治、经济，也能领导文教科技”，“不仅能在方针政策上领导，具体问题也领导得很好”。由于认识的提高，对基层党组织的看法和关系，较前有所改变，越来越多的人向党组织靠近一步，有的人还光荣地参加了中国共产党。对党的路线、方针和政策，多数人认识到党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社是建设社会主义的三个法宝，表示要以总路线的精神来要求自己，作为工作、思想的准则。对党的教育方针，也有了更多的体会和认识，不少人放下架子，和群众一起工作，下厂下乡，用自己的实际行动来贯彻党的教育方针。在自我改造上，不少人感到“形势发展很快，改造自己也要快马加鞭”。有的原来不愿谈思想的，也向党说老实话，主动争取党的教育和群众的帮助。对于服务，不少人愿意“为社会主义大厦贡献一砖一石”。原来干劲大的，更是劲上加劲；原来干劲不足的，也有了变化；有的人还作出了显著成绩。事实说明，一年多来，我们文教界上中层旧知识分子的政治思想情况和服务态度，已经发生了很大的变化。特别是在接受党的领导上，跟反右整风运动以前多数人同情附合右派、严重向右摇摆的情况相比较，变化更加显著。目前，一部分人基本上从资本主义立场转到社会主义的立场上来了；多数人向左跨进了一大步，社会主义一面逐渐增加，资本主义一面逐渐减少；停滞不前、基本上未变的是少数。这表明多数人在由资本主义到社会主义、在由资产阶级知识分子向工人阶级知识分子转化的道路上，前进了一大步。
    另一方面，我们还必须充分认识文教界上中层旧知识分子的大有进步，是同我们自己一年多以前的情况比较而言，如果从资产阶级知识分子的根本改造来说，特别是跟当前大跃进形势比较起来，我们的进步不仅显得很不够，而且在自我改造和服务态度上，都还存在着不少问题。如对党的领导，有的人口头上说党能领导科学技术，而内心却认为“我还有一套”，自视甚高，夸大个人作用。有的人一面向党交心，一面又心存疑虑。对党的基层组织的年青负责人，不少人是表面服而心里不服。对党的方针政策，合意的就接受，不合意的就表面拥护，思想不通。对“三个万岁”，道理上通了，实际上不完全通，特别接触到个人的问题时，就显得更不通，因而表现出来不同程度的怀疑和动摇，有的甚至抵触或不满。对大跃进，有些人仍然感到被动；工作是在做，但总想“松一口气”。对自我改造有些人决心不大，或者感到厌倦。有重业务、轻政治，放松改造的倾向。随着社会主义革命的不断深入，在教学和科研上两条道路、两种观点、两种方法的斗争，就越来越突出。特别是在教育思想和学术观点方面，反映出的一些问题和党仍有分歧。以上这些情况，充分说明一年多来，文教界旧知识分子是大有进步的，但也还存在不少问题，多数人还有两面性和反复性，还必须在党的领导和教育下，在积极服务中继续加强改造。
    事实还证明，一年多来，我们文教界上中层旧知识分子能够在服务中作出成绩，在改造上获得进步，在反复曲折中前进了一大步，最根本的原因就在于不同程度地接受了党的领导和教育。目前存在的问题，也主要发生在接受党的领导方面。因此，接受党的领导，对我们文教界上中层旧知识分子的服务和改造来说，是一个根本性的关键问题。今后，我们为了进一步搞好服务，促进改造，就必须全面地真诚地接受党的领导。
    什么是全面地真诚地接受党的领导呢？我们体会到：
    要全面真诚接受党的领导，就必须认真学习和努力贯彻执行党的路线、方针和政策，并向一切脱离党的领导与违反党的路线、方针、政策的思想言行作坚决斗争。同时，依靠党的领导，必须发挥主动积极精神，不能等待依赖，要主动向党请示汇报，千方百计地克服一切困难，贯彻党的指示和意图，努力完成党交给的任务。
    要全面真诚接受党的领导，就必须既要坚决接受上级党委的领导，又要坚决接受基层党组织的领导。党的路线、方针和政策，是通过党的基层组织来贯彻执行的。因此，只有认真接受基层党组织的领导，才能保证党的领导落实。接受党的领导，决不能因人而异，有的人往往以基层党组织的负责人是自己的学生或者比较年轻就不愿意接受，这对我们服务和改造是极为严重的障碍，必须坚决克服。
    要全面真诚接受党的领导，还必须坚决克服我们对党的三心二意，做到和党一条心。坚决听党的话，听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路，矢志不渝，就会逐渐培养起热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义的感情，这就能成为我们积极服务、加强改造的动力。要真正做到和党一条心，培养起热爱党和毛主席的思想感情，这就需要树立无产阶级的世界观，坚决克服资产阶级个人主义，坚持一切服从最大多数人民的最大利益的根本原则，一心顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。我们知道，党是人民利益的集中代表者，只要我们一心顾人民利益这一头，就能够和党血肉相联，同呼吸，共命运，培养起热爱党和毛主席的思想感情。
    要全面真诚接受党的领导，必须明确认识资本主义必然灭亡，社会主义、共产主义必然胜利的社会发展规律，只有遵循这个规律，跟着党走社会主义、共产主义的道路，才可能掌握自己的命运。无数事实证明，党和毛主席的英明领导，使我国革命和建设取得了史无前例的辉煌成就。我们在前进的道路上，只有依靠工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党，绝对服从党的领导，才有光明的前途。
    我国革命和建设的伟大胜利，是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的胜利。归根到底，是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的光辉典范，是马克思列宁主义的重大发展。我们就必须认真学习毛主席的著作，积极投入广大群众学习毛主席著作的热潮，深入领会和正确掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想贯彻到实践中去，作为我们服务和改造的准则。这样，我们就能够正确掌握党的路线、方针和政策，消除各种各样的疑虑，彻底克服资产阶级的教育思想和学术观点，正确处理个人与集体之间的关系，树立绝对服从党的领导思想，培养起热爱党和毛主席的思想感情，加强我们的政治立场和世界观的改造，沿着又红又专的光明大道前进。
    各位代表，今年是我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业连续大跃进的第三年，我们的各项事业在实现今年开门红的基础上正在继续飞跃发展。这样的大好形势，更加鼓舞我们奋勇前进。我们一定要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，立大志，攀高峰，以出色的成绩向文教战线上的群英会献礼，为胜利完成1960年的国民经济计划而贡献出我们的一切力量。
