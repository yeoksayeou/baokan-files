    This Newspaper Receives Hundreds of Letters
    Vowing to Support the South Korean People
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper's editorial department has received hundreds of letters from readers in the past two days, enthusiastically supporting the just struggle of the South Korean people. Among those who wrote were veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought alongside the Korean people, Korean students, and many groups of young students who wrote collectively in the name of their team or class. These young students stated in their letters that they would support the struggle of the South Korean people with practical actions, such as studying hard and completing their "May Day" gifts ahead of schedule. All the commanders and fighters of the 22nd Regiment of a certain militia division said in their letter: In order to support the just struggle of the South Korean people, their enthusiasm for production is increasing, and they have now completed the April production plan three days ahead of schedule. Students from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, upon seeing the news of the 500,000-person demonstration in Seoul, enthusiastically wrote one hundred and several dozen letters that day and sent people to the newspaper's editorial department overnight.
