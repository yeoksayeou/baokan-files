Wan Neng Service Department

Representative Li Dongqing Discusses the New Face of Hubu Alley in Wuchang

　　Here there are 951 households, three canteens, seventeen nurseries and kindergartens, eighteen living service stations, and four boiling water stations. People call the service places here the street's "General Affairs Section."

　　Fellow Representatives:

　　I firmly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and the written work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I suggest the Congress approve them and guarantee their implementation in practical work.

　　Now, I will give a brief report to all the representatives on the situation of the "Wan Neng Service Department" in Hubu Alley, Wuchang District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, organizing the people's economic life.

　　The Hubu Alley Residents Committee is the "Wan Neng Service Department" of Minzhu Road Street, Wuchang District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province. The Residents Committee has 951 households and 3,412 people. It was gradually developed from a service station organized in August 1958. At that time, there were only four stations for laundry, sewing, boiling water supply, and agency savings, with only fourteen service personnel. With the development of the socialist construction cause, according to the Party's instruction of "grasping production with one hand and life with the other," under the leadership of the street party general branch, three public canteens have been established, with more than 500 people eating there; seventeen kindergartens and nurseries (including simple kindergartens), accommodating 477 children; eighteen professional living service stations, serving more than 1,400 people daily; and four boiling water and hot water stations, supplying water to 600 people daily. In addition, there are twelve commodity consignment stores and small shops, and thirty mutual aid groups for household chores. The service content is all-encompassing. The service items of the living service station alone include more than fifty items such as laundry, sewing, house cleaning, shopping, handling weddings and funerals, painting and wallpapering houses, caring for patients and pregnant women, acting as moving and delivery agents, helping travelers find relatives and friends, and guiding them to accommodation. It has begun to comprehensively organize the people's economic life and has become a "Wan Neng Service Department." The masses call it the street's "General Affairs Section," praising the "Wan Neng Service Department" as a red logistics department supporting production, and logistics soldiers supporting production.

　　After learning from the advanced experience of service stations in Erlong Road in Beijing and Dahuo Alley in Tianjin, through studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and carrying out the education movement to oppose rightism and encourage vigor, in the battle to achieve a red bottom in 1959 and a good start in 1960, they also learned from the experience of Shangqingsi in Chongqing in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. With the development of the situation and the demands of the broad masses, the service scope has been continuously expanded, and the service items have been increased from the original four service stations to the current eighteen specialized branches. The service scope has increased from sixty-three types to more than 350 items, enabling the service work to reach a new peak in extensively organizing the people's economic life. It has achieved "no idle people in every household, everyone has something to do, universal service, all trivial matters are taken care of, no worries about everything, everything is delivered to your hands, everything is for production, a red logistics department." The Hubu Alley Residents Committee has now basically achieved "five modernizations," namely the socialization of housework, canteenization of eating, nurseryization of children, universalization of consignment stores, and comprehensive and diversified services. The "Wan Neng Service Department" has "taken care" of all the people's lives, truly achieving "good service in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and comprehensive care for birth, old age, sickness, and death."

　　Of the thousands of service works, serving production is the first priority. They put forward "Everything is for production, serving the central work of the Party." As long as it is beneficial to production, the service personnel will be there whenever they are called, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, day or night, and going to factories to provide services has become a system of the service department. The employees of the nearby thirty-six factories, institutions, restaurants, and other units have become their service objects. They have established a close relationship with the employees like fish and water. Every day, the service personnel enthusiastically go to the workers with needles, thread, scissors, scraps of cloth, and laundry tools. They wash them when they are dirty and mend them when they are broken. They are not afraid of dirt or trouble, and they mend every piece of clothing firmly and neatly, and wash every piece of clothing cleanly. Sometimes, they also attach a letter of condolence to the washed clothes. They care for the employees more than their own relatives. For example, Yang Shuying, an employee of the Wuchang Cotton Weaving Factory, asked the service station's Chen Yuqing to alter her cotton-padded coat because it was too big and not warm enough to wear. Chen Yuqing was too busy attending meetings during the day to alter it. At night, the north wind was howling, and the weather turned cold. At this time, she remembered that when Yang Shuying took off her cotton-padded coat, she only changed into a thin cotton-padded coat. The weather was so cold, and if she got sick, not only would she suffer, but production would also be affected. So she rushed to work until 4:00 in the morning and finished the alteration. As soon as it dawned, she sent the cotton-padded coat over. When Yang Shuying put on this well-fitting cotton-padded coat, she was so moved that she couldn't speak for a long time, and excitedly said: "The service station is even closer than my own relatives!"

　　They provide meticulous care for dual-income families (both husband and wife participating in work) with many children and heavy housework. The service personnel link up with the dual-income families living in the same room or next door and provide door-to-door service. For example, Wang Peiyun, a worker in a spinning factory, has five children. In the past, her house was often in a mess, and she had to worry about both production and family at the same time. Since the service station provided door-to-door service, she only needs to hand over the key to the service personnel every day, and she can go to work without any worries. She often said to the service personnel: "Your service is so thoughtful, it's like having parents at home."

　　The canteens and boiling water stations ensure that hot tea and hot meals are supplied to the workers where they are fighting. The nurseries and kindergartens ensure that children are accepted and taken care of as soon as they are sent there. If the mothers are busy with meetings or production, the caregivers will stay in the kindergartens, picking them up in the morning and sending them home in the evening, and sometimes helping the children put on clothes and comb their hair, so that the mothers can work and produce with peace of mind.

　　They provide even more meticulous care and give relatives-like consideration and comfort to orphans, the elderly, the disabled, the families of revolutionary martyrs, and pregnant women. For those who have difficulty in moving, they also deliver meals, hot tea, and hot water, clean houses, and decoct medicine for them every day. The masses have responded very well, with some saying: "This is even better than a filial son." They all say: "The Party is really concerned about the people. With the service station, there are relatives everywhere, just like a warm big family."

　　In order to facilitate the masses and better serve them, the service department has also set up four service boxes, which are opened two or three times a day. If the masses have anything to do, they only need to drop a note in the nearby box, and the service personnel will provide door-to-door service. It is really "no worries about everything, everything is delivered to your hands," and everyone is satisfied.

　　In addition, the service department also receives hundreds of people from all directions every day who make various requests. There are people from the city, passers-by from other places, workers, farmers, old people, and children. The service personnel treat them like relatives, try their best to leave the difficulties to themselves, and make it convenient for others, always thinking of the masses. For example, a traveler passing through Wuhan on his way to Beijing urgently needed a suitable cotton hat. Because of the tight schedule, the sewing shops were unwilling to make it, so he asked the service station to make the cotton hat for him. The service personnel immediately agreed to the request, made it overnight, and delivered the hat to the traveler on time. The service department is so responsive to requests, wholeheartedly serving the masses.

　　Since the establishment of the "Wan Neng Service Department" in Hubu Alley, all women with labor or semi-labor ability have basically been organized to participate in various social production activities. On the basis of universal mobilization and voluntary registration, 225 women were organized to participate in service work, fully utilizing the potential strength of housewives. The service department assigns them to various different service jobs according to their specialties and the strength of their labor force. For example, those who can sew go to the sewing station, those who can cut hair go to the barber station, those who have labor force go to the labor service station, those with less housework work in the station, and those with more housework take the work home. In this way, they can do their best, be flexible and convenient, take care of housework, participate in social activities, and increase their personal income (generally earning 10 to 30 yuan per month), achieving three goals with one action. At the same time, the service department also organized housewives to engage in sideline production, such as tearing hemp, packaging medicine, making shoe soles, and pasting paper bags. They also raised twenty-eight pigs, 5,525 chickens and ducks, and planted 2.5 mu of vegetables, further improving the lives of the masses. As Lenin said: "...only in places where the trivial housework is universally transformed into a socialist economy can there be true women's liberation and true communism."

　　The gradual development of the Hubu Alley "Wan Neng Service Department" to comprehensively organize the people's economic life is mainly due to the Party's leadership and the continuous improvement of the masses' awareness, and the result of putting politics and ideology in command. In various service works, they relied on the strength of the masses, adhered to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, and built them up from scratch in a simple and crude manner. Therefore, they have achieved remarkable results in their work, and they have been able to make extraordinary achievements in ordinary labor. This March, they were honorably awarded the National Women's Federation "March 8th" Red Flag Collective Award and the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation "March 8th" Medal, and are also one of the fourteen red flags established by our Wuhan City Women's Federation among the broad masses of women.

　　When the service station was first established, some people had the wrong idea, thinking that "the service station is just doing things to serve people, and there is no future," "doing this kind of thing earns less money, is troublesome, and does not end well." In response to these ideas, the street party organization organized the masses to study and debate, and drew a clear line between what is glorious and what is not, and between what has a future and what does not. The secretary of the Party General Branch said well: "What is ugly and what is not, serving the masses is the most glorious thing." He also personally carried a burden and shouted on the street "Repairing and welding white iron!" The branch secretary also took time out of his busy schedule to participate in service work, thus reversing the masses' wrong perceptions. The service personnel were all moved and said: "Compared with the branch secretary, we really have to work harder!" On the basis of the Party's general line and socialist education, especially through studying Chairman Mao's works, the masses' awareness has been further improved, the boundaries between the two lines and the two ideologies have been drawn, and the collectivist ideology of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" and the concept of labor being glorious have been enhanced. Everyone takes it as an honor to compete to participate in service work. For example, some people who used to prefer to do temporary work outside rather than engage in service work also automatically joined the service department. They have achieved everyone caring about the collective and taking the station as their home. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to establish lofty ambitions and strive to catch up with the national advanced level at a high speed, and to push the service work to a peak in a comprehensive leap forward.

　　At present, they have launched a high tide of technical innovation in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization, semi- mechanization, automation, and semi-automation proposed by the Party, and have quickly innovated and created eleven kinds of tools and cooking utensils such as washing machines, vegetable cutting machines, rice measuring machines, and multi-purpose stoves. They are now continuing to innovate and create in order to improve the quality of service and better meet the ever-increasing demands of the masses.

　　Fellow representatives, the Hubu Alley "Wan Neng Service Department" is one of the thousands of service undertakings in our city. Through this service department, it specifically illustrates that extensively organizing the people's economic life and liberating tens of thousands of housewives from housework is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life. This service department has organically combined the lives of the masses with the national planned economy, and is turning the ideal that the masses yearn for, "the young have the opportunity to grow, the strong have the opportunity to work, the old have the opportunity to be supported, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and sick are all cared for," into a reality. Here, the thoroughly liberated women are working selflessly for a brand-new life; here, the old traditional habits that have dominated people for thousands of years are being uprooted; a brand-new life is rising from the East like the sun. Let us all cheer for this beautiful and happy life!

　　Finally, I wish the Congress a complete success and all the representatives good health.

    万能服务部
    李冬青代表谈武昌户部巷的新面貌
    这里有九百五十一户，办起三个食堂，十七所托儿所幼儿园，十八处生活服务站，四处开水站。人们把这里的服务场所称为街道“总务科”。各位代表：
    我坚决拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和全国人民代表大会常务委员会所作的书面工作报告，建议大会予以通过，并保证在实际工作中贯彻执行。
    现在，我就湖北省武汉市武昌区户部巷“万能服务部”组织人民经济生活的情况向各位代表作个简要的汇报。
    户部巷居民委员会是我省武汉市武昌区民主路街的“万能服务部”，该居民委员会共有九百五十一户，三千四百一十二人。它是由1958年8月组织起来的服务站逐步发展起来的。当时只有洗衣、缝衣、供应开水、代办储蓄等四个站，服务人员仅有十四人。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，根据党的“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的指示，在街道党总支的领导下，目前已经成立公共食堂三个，有五百多人搭伙；幼儿园、托儿所（包括简易园所）十七所，收托幼儿四百七十七个；生活服务专业站十八处，每天服务达到一千四百多人次；开水、热水站四处，每天供应六百人用水。另外还有商品代销店和小卖部十二处，家务劳动互助组三十个。服务内容应有尽有，仅生活服务站的服务项目就有洗衣、缝补、打扫房屋、代购东西、代办婚丧等事、粉刷裱糊房屋、护理病人和孕妇、代理搬家送货、帮助旅客寻亲访友、引路投宿等五十多项。它已经开始把人民经济生活全面地组织起来了，成为“万能服务部”，群众称之为街道的“总务科”，称赞“万能服务部”是支援生产的红色后勤部，支援生产的后勤兵。
    经过学习了北京二龙路和天津大伙巷等地服务站的先进经验，通过党的八届八中全会文件的学习和开展反右倾、鼓干劲的教育运动，在实现1959年红到底和1960年开门红的战斗中，又学习了重庆上清寺全面组织人民经济生活的经验，随着形势的发展和广大群众的要求，不断地扩大了服务范围，增加了服务项目，由原来的四个服务站扩大到现在的十八个专业分站，服务范围由六十三种增为三百五十多个项
  目，使服务工作登上了广泛地组织人民经济生活的新高峰。做到了“户户无闲人，人人有事做，服务普遍化，琐事全包下，事事不担忧，样样送到手，一切为生产，红色后勤部”。户部巷居民委员会现在已经基本上实现了“五化”，即家务劳动社会化，吃饭食堂化，孩子托儿化，代销店普遍化，服务全面多样化。“万能服务部”把群众的生活全部“包”下来了，真正做到了“衣食住行服务好，生老病死管周到”。
    服务工作千条万条，服务生产是第一条，她们提出“一切为生产服务，为党的中心工作服务”。只要有利于生产，服务员不论晴天雨天，白天黑夜，随叫随到，那里需要就到那里，下厂服务已经成了服务部的制度，附近的三十六个工厂、机关、餐馆等单位的职工，成了她们的服务对象，她们和职工建立了如同鱼水般的亲密关系，每天，服务员们带着针线、剪刀、碎布和洗衣工具，热情地走到工人身旁，见脏就洗，见破就补，她们不嫌脏，不怕麻烦，件件补得结结实实，整整齐齐，件件洗得干干净净，有时还在洗好的衣服里附上一封慰问信，她们关心职工胜过亲人。如武昌棉织厂的职工杨淑英因棉袄过大，穿上不暖和，请服务站的陈玉清服务员代为翻改，陈玉清因为白天开会忙没改成，到了晚上，北风呼呼地刮起来了，天气转冷，这时候她想起了杨淑英脱下棉袄的时候，只换了一件单薄的棉袄，天这样冷，要是冻病了，不仅人吃亏，生产也受影响。于是连夜赶做到深夜四点钟改好了，天刚发白就把棉袄送去了。当杨淑英穿上这件合身的棉袄时，感动得好久说不出话来，激动地说：“服务站比我的亲人还要亲啊！”
    对于孩子多、家务重的双职工（夫妇均参加工作），更是照顾得无微不至，服务员分别与自己同屋住的或左邻右舍的双职工挂上钩，上门服务。如一纱厂工人王培芸有五个孩子，过去屋里常常弄得一团糟，生产时一心挂两头，自从服务站上门服务后，每天只要把钥匙交给服务员，就可以无牵无挂地去上班。她常对服务员说：“你们服务这样周到，真像有父母在家里一样。”
    食堂和开水站做到工人战斗在那里，热茶热饭供应在那里，托儿所、幼儿园做到随送随收。如果妈妈们开会或生产忙，保教员就不离园，作到了早上门接，晚送回家，有时还帮助孩子穿衣裳、梳头，让妈妈们能安心上班生产。
    对于孤老残废、烈军属、孕产妇等人，照顾得更是无微不至，并给以亲人般的体贴和安慰，对在行动上有困难的还作到天天为他们送饭、送热茶热水，打扫房屋，还代煎汤熬药。群众反映很好，有的说：“这比孝子还好些。”都说：“党对人民真关心，有了服务站，到处是亲人，就像一个温暖的大家庭。”
    服务部为了方便群众，更好的为群众服务，还设立了四处服务箱，每天开两三次，群众有事，只要在附近的箱内丢个字条，服务员就会上门服务，真是“事事不担忧，样样送到手”，人人满意。
    另外，服务部每天还要接待几百个来自四面八方和提出各种各样要求的人，有本市的、外地过路的，有工人、农民，有老年人、小孩，服务员都像接待亲人一样地去接待他们，尽量把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，处处为群众着想。如有一个路过武汉来北京的旅客，当时急需一顶合适的棉风帽，因为时间紧，缝纫店都不肯做，就请服务站代做这顶棉帽子，服务员立即答应了这个要求，当夜做成，按时把帽子送到旅客手里。服务部就是这样有求必应，全心全意地为群众服务。
    户部巷自成立“万能服务部”以来，凡是有劳动力或半劳动力的妇女，基本上都组织起来了，分别参加到社会各项生产。在普遍发动，自愿报名的基础上，组织了二百二十五名妇女参加了服务工作，充分发挥了家庭妇女的潜在力量。服务部根据各人的特长和劳动力的强弱，分配她们参加各种不同的服务工作，比如会缝纫的到缝纫站，会理发的到理发站，有劳动力的到劳动服务站，家务活少的到站内工作，家务活多的把活带回家去做。这样，作到了各尽所能，灵活方便，既照顾了家务，也参加了社会活动，又增加了个人的收入（一般每人每月收入十至三十元），一举三得。同时，服务部还组织了家庭妇女大搞副业生产，比如撕麻、包药、打鞋底、粘纸袋等。还养了二十八头猪，鸡鸭五千五百二十五只，种菜二点五亩，进一步地改善了群众的生活。这正如列宁所说的：“……只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”
    户部巷“万能服务部”逐步发展到全面地组织人民经济生活，主要是由于党的领导和群众觉悟的不断提高，政治思想挂帅的结果。在各种服务工作中，都依靠了群众的力量，本着勤俭办一切事业的精神，因陋就简，从无到有办起来的。因此，在工作上取得了显著的成绩，她们能够在平凡的劳动中，作出了不平凡的事迹。今年3月又光荣地获得了全国妇联“三八”红旗集体奖励和湖北省妇联“三八”奖章，也是我们武汉市妇联在广大妇女中树立的十四面红旗之一。
    在开始建立服务站的时候，有的人有着错误的看法，认为“服务站尽是做些侍候人的事，没有出息”，“干这种事拿钱少，又麻烦，还不落好。”街道党的组织针对这些思想，组织群众学习辩论，划清光荣与不光荣，有出息与没出息的界限。党总支书记说得好：“什么叫丑不丑，为群众服务是最光荣的事。”他还亲自挑着担子上街喊叫“修焊白铁！”支部书记也在百忙中抽空参加服务工作，因而扭转了群众的错误看法，服务员都感动的说：“我们和支部书记一比，真要加油干才行！”在党的总路线和社会主义教育的基础上，特别是通过学习毛主席的著作，群众觉悟进一步提高，划清了两条路线、两种思想的界限，提高了“我为人人，人人为我”的集体主义思想和劳动光荣的观念，人人以争先参加服务工作为光荣，如过去有些宁愿在外边做临时工而不愿搞服务工作的人，也自动的参加了服务部的工作。作到了人人关心集体，以站为家。大家一致表示树雄心、立大志，要高速度飞步向全国先进水平看齐，把服务工作推向全面跃进的高峰。
    目前，她们在党所提出的开展以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的运动中，掀起了大闹技术革新的高潮，迅速地革新了洗衣机、切菜机、量米机、万能灶等十一种工具、炊具。现在还正在继续革新创造，为提高服务质量，更好地为不断满足群众的要求而努力。
    各位代表，户部巷“万能服务部”是我市千百个服务事业中的一个，通过这个服务部具体地说明了广泛地组织人民经济生活，使成千成万的家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。这个服务部已经把群众的生活和国家的计划经济有机地结合起来了，并且正在把群众所向往的“幼有所长，壮有所用，老有所终，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的理想变成现实生活了。在这里，彻底解放了的妇女们，正在为全新的生活而忘我的劳动着；在这里，千百年来支配着人们的旧的传统习惯，正在被连根拔掉；全新的生活，正像太阳一样从东方升起。让我们大家欢呼这美好而幸福的生活吧！
    最后祝大会胜利成功，各位代表身体健康。
