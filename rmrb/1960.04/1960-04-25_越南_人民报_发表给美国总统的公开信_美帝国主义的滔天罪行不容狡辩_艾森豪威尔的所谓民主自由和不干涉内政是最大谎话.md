Editor's Note: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an open letter signed LT "To the US President" on April 21st. The full text is as follows: Dear Sir:

Recently, in a letter replying to Chilean students criticizing US imperialism, you said that the United States is a country of democracy and freedom, and never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, etc.

The next day, Chilean newspapers replied to your letter. They said: "The President's letter is full of naked slander and reactionary clamor, aimed at covering up his war policies and robber behavior..."

In February this year, during your visit to four South American countries, you personally witnessed the hatred for US imperialism in the welcoming ceremonies that brought tears to your eyes. An American leader, Mr. Stevenson, also admitted: "Anti-American sentiment in South American countries is extremely serious. Anyone who publicly expresses pro-Americanism will be treated by the people in the same way that the French treated Hitler's lackeys in the past" (American newspaper, February 11, 1960).

If you continue to clamor against communism, you will end up like Hitler. Your friend Mr. Harriman also had to admit: "In the ideological struggle, the advantage clearly belongs to socialism rather than capitalism..." (American newspaper, February 11, 1960).

You say the United States is democratic.

Have you forgotten how your compatriots, the American Negroes, are being abused? In addition to being subjected to all kinds of abuse, most American Negroes do not have civil rights. For example, out of the five million American Negro voters in the southern United States, four million cannot vote. Regarding the right to vote, American Negroes often receive threatening letters that say: "Last warning: If you don't want to live, go vote and then die." Black priest G. Lee was beaten to death for mobilizing black parishioners to participate in elections.

In the southern United States, many methods are used to prevent American Negroes from participating in elections, such as: paying poll taxes, taking exams, boycotting the sweet potatoes and grains of black farmers if they go to vote, and black workers facing unemployment, etc.

Recently, at a meeting discussing the issue of American Negro voting rights, more than 20 senators took turns giving speeches for more than 125 hours, and they wanted to continue speaking. They spoke so tirelessly mainly to abolish the law on granting American Negroes the right to vote. Is this democracy and freedom?

You say the United States does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Every year, the United States spends hundreds of millions of dollars to send spies to various countries, uses more than two billion dollars to arm pro-American countries in preparation for war, and the United States has established 250 military bases in various countries. What is this if not interference?

In Vietnam alone, in 1954, when the French colonialists were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, who conspired to use atomic bombs against Vietnam's war of resistance? – It was the United States. Then, who took the lead in establishing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc? – It was the United States!

Who is organizing, equipping, training Ngo Dinh Diem's army and directing them to use aircraft and tanks to sweep and massacre the people of South Vietnam? – It is the United States!

Who instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to enact the "Law No. 10 of 1959" fascist law and push the head-chopping machine all over South Vietnam? Who taught the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to poison and kill thousands of people in Phu Loi and drag hundreds of patriotic and peace-loving people to beheaded, have their hands chopped off, their eyes gouged out, and their abdomens cut open? Who is instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to violate the Geneva Accords, divide the country, and obstruct the Vietnamese people from unifying their motherland?

All these heinous crimes must be fully borne by the American interventionists.

What else can you justify?

### 越南“人民报”发表给美国总统的公开信  美帝国主义的滔天罪行不容狡辩  艾森豪威尔的所谓民主自由和不干涉内政是最大谎话

    越南“人民报”发表给美国总统的公开信
    美帝国主义的滔天罪行不容狡辩
    艾森豪威尔的所谓民主自由和不干涉内政是最大谎话
    编者按：越南“人民报”在4月21日发表了一封署名LT的“给美国总统的公开信”，全文如下：亲爱的先生：
    最近，在答复智利学生批评美帝国主义的一封信的时候，您说：美国是民主自由的国家，从来不干涉其他国家的内政等等。
    第二天，智利报纸就答复了你的信。他们说：“总统的信充满赤裸裸的污蔑和反动叫嚣的论调，目的在于掩盖自己的战争政策和强盗的行为……”。
    今年2月间，在访问南美四个国家的时候，您曾经从使您流出眼泪的欢迎仪式中亲眼看到对美帝国主义的仇恨。美国一位领导人史蒂文森先生也承认：“南美各国的反美情绪极其严重。谁公开表示亲美，谁就被人民像法国人过去对待希特勒的走狗那样来对待他”（美国报纸1960年2月11日）。
    如果您继续叫嚣反共，您也会得到像希特勒一样的下场。你的朋友哈利曼先生也不得不承认：“在思想斗争方面，优势显然已经属于社会主义而不是属于资本主义……”（美国报纸1960年2月11日）。
    您说美国是民主的。
    你的同胞——美国黑人怎样的受虐待，难道您忘记了吗？除了受到种种虐待之外，大部分的美国黑人都没有公民权。例如，美国南部的五百万美国黑人选民中，就有四百万人不能投票。选举权，美国黑人往往收到恫吓信，信中写道：“最后一次警告：如果你不愿意活下去，你就去投票，然后死去吧”。黑人神父格·里因为动员黑人教徒参加选举而被打死。
    在美国南部，许多手段被采用来阻止美国黑人参加选举。如：要交纳选民税、要考试，如果黑人农民去投票人家就抵制他的地瓜和谷子，如果是黑人工人，他就将遭到失业等等。
    最近在讨论美国黑人选举权问题的会议上，二十多名参议员轮班的作了一百二十五个多小时的讲演，他们还要继续讲演。他们如此不厌其烦地讲演主要是为了取消关于给予美国黑人选举权的法令。这难道是民主自由吗？
    您说美国不干涉其他国家的内政。
    每年美国开支成亿美元来向各国派出特务，用二十多亿美元来武装亲美国家以准备战争，美国在各国建立了二百五十个军事基地。这不是干涉是什么呢？
    仅在越南，1954年，法殖民者在奠边府大败时，谁曾经阴谋用原子弹反对越南的抗战？——正是美国，接着，谁曾经领头成立了东南亚侵略集团？——正是美国！
    谁在组织、装备、训练吴庭艳军队和指挥他们用飞机、坦克扫荡和惨杀越南南方人民？——正是美国！
    谁唆使吴庭艳集团定出“59年第十号”法西斯法令和推着砍头机走遍了南越呢？谁教给吴庭艳集团放毒药杀死在富利的成千人和把成百爱国、爱和平的人民拉去砍头、砍手、挖眼睛和剖腹呢？谁在指使吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议，分割国家，阻挠越南人民统一自己的祖国呢？
    所有这些滔天罪行都要由美国干涉者完全负责。
    您还有什么可以狡辩呢？
