    Transplanting Commune Members Laugh at the Cuckoo
    Willows droop by the commune river,
    Willow branches not as green as the rice seedlings,
    A cuckoo bird flies over,
    Repeatedly urging "Plant the grain!"
    Transplanting commune members laugh heartily,
    Laughing, saying the cuckoo is senile:
    “Cuckoo, cuckoo,
    Out of touch with the times,
    Last year as soon as you opened your mouth to call,
    The seedlings were already an inch high.
    This year we sowed the grain,
    You were sleeping soundly in the forest,
    Waking up to urge 'Plant the grain!'
    We've already transplanted the seedlings.
    We have great leaps forward every day,
    But you still sing the same old tune every year!”

    插秧社员笑布谷
    公社河边垂杨柳，
    杨柳不及秧苗绿，
    飞来一只布谷鸟，
    口口声声催布谷。
    插秧社员哈哈笑，
    笑说布谷老糊涂：
    “布谷布谷，
    不识时务，
    去年你刚张嘴叫，
    秧苗已长寸把高。
    今年我们播谷种，
    你在林中睡大觉，
    醒来张嘴催布谷，
    我们已经插秧苗。
    我们天天大跃进，
    你却年年唱老调！”
