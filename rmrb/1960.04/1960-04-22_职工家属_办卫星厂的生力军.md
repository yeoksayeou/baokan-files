Dependents of Employees – A Vital Force in Running Satellite Factories

(Our dispatch from Baotou, April 21) Baotou Iron and Steel Company is organizing the dependents of employees to participate in industrial construction and vigorously establish satellite factories for construction teams. This is an integral part of Baogang's extensive diversification. Currently, the dependents of employees have become an important force in Baogang's construction.

In the past two years, the construction and production units affiliated with Baogang have, based on actual needs and adhering to the principles of self-reliance as the mainstay, company assistance as a supplement, utilizing local materials, making do with whatever is available, starting small and growing bigger, moving from simple to complex, decentralized operation, and unified management, successively established many satellite factories. According to statistics from the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company, the Boiler Construction Company, and the Pipeline Company alone, more than 1,100 households of dependents have been organized to participate in production and construction. Among them, more than 800 housewives have mastered various professional skills and become capable assistants to the construction teams. For example, the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company, with its eight family factories established by more than 400 households of dependents, including electrical component processing, tool manufacturing, welding rod production, and self-made cement, has produced 27 types of products in the past year, such as metal screws, welding rods, cable hooks, cable pull plates, copper and aluminum joints, and wire baskets, with a total output value of more than 363,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the labor of more than 340 skilled workers. Last year, during the intense construction of the coking project, the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company lacked 25 tons of metal screws. If skilled workers were used to produce them, it would take 150 people three months to complete. Later, the dependents of employees were organized to process and produce them, which not only ensured the quality of the products but also ensured that the coking project was put into production on schedule.

Last year, on the Baogang construction site, welding rods and labor protection supplies were once in short supply. They promptly organized family factories to produce 78 tons of welding rods and made more than 8,500 sets of work clothes and more than 4,000 pairs of gloves, which basically met the construction needs. This year, with the shortage of steel, they promptly organized dependents to manufacture wet-ground slag cement and used this cement to make structural components to replace some steel. The 30,000 cable supports currently being made alone will save 54 tons of steel.

### 职工家属——办卫星厂的生力军

    职工家属——办卫星厂的生力军
    本报包头21日电　包头钢铁公司组织职工家属参加工业建设，大办施工队伍的卫星工厂。这是包钢大搞多种经营的一个组成部分。现在，职工家属已成为包钢建设中的重要力量。
    包钢所属施工、生产单位近两年来，根据实际需要，本着自力更生为主，公司资助为辅，就地取材，因陋就简，由小到大，由简到繁，分散经营，统一管理等原则，先后办起了很多卫星工厂。仅据机电安装公司、筑炉公司、管道公司等四个单位的统计，就组织了一千一百多户家属参加了生产建设。其中已有八百多名家庭妇女掌握了各种不同的专业技术，成为施工队伍的得力助手。如机电安装公司，由四百多户家属创办的电气原件加工、机具制造、焊条生产、自制水泥等八个家属工厂，一年来生产了金属螺旋、电焊条、电缆挂钩、电缆拉板、铜铝接头、铁丝筐等二十七种产品，产值达三十六万三千多元，其工作量相当于三百四十多名技术工人的劳动。机电安装公司，去年在焦化工程施工紧张时期，缺少二十五吨金属螺旋，如用技术工人生产，需要一百五十人干三个月才能完成。后来，组织职工家属加工生产，不仅保证了产品质量，还保证了焦化工程按期投入生产。
    去年包钢工地上，电焊条和劳动保护用品一度供不应求，他们及时组织家属工厂生产了电焊条七十八吨，制做了工作服八千五百多件、手套四千多副，基本上满足了施工需要。今年，钢材缺乏，他们又及时组织家属制造湿碾矿渣水泥，并用这种水泥制成结构件，代替部分钢材；仅目前正在制作的三万个电缆支架，即可节约钢材五十四吨。
