    Speech by Committee Member Chen Yunzhang

    Presidium, fellow committee members:
    I am now reporting to the assembly on some of the leaps forward at Hunan University during the Great Leap Forward era, and some of my personal thoughts before and after the Great Leap Forward.
    Speaking of the history of Hunan University, it has been forty-two years since its establishment. As early as when it was being prepared in 1918, Chairman Mao lived in the preparatory office and carried out many revolutionary activities, which created a glorious historical tradition for Hunan University. However, this school, in the old China era, due to the social system, the civil war, intermittent operation, lack of funding, poor teaching staff, and even worse equipment, teaching quality was out of the question. When it was taken over in 1949, Hunan University only had 193 teachers. In 1959, the school had 504 teachers. The number of students graduating in the five years from 1954 to 1958 was more than four times the number of graduates in the nineteen years from 1930 to 1949 in old China. As for the building area and equipment of the school, it is even more difficult to compare. It can be said that the true life of Hunan University began after liberation.
    In the ten years since liberation, Hunan University has undergone several adjustments due to the needs of the situation, but the quality of work in all aspects has been continuously improving. During the restructuring of colleges and departments in 1953, the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture was formed on the basis of part of the original Hunan University. In 1958, it was expanded into the multi-disciplinary Hunan Institute of Technology. In 1959, Hunan University, a comprehensive university of arts, sciences, and engineering, was established on the basis of the Hunan Institute of Technology. Therefore, the new Hunan University is a product of the Great Leap Forward era.
    Now, I would like to first talk about some of the leaps forward at Hunan University during the Great Leap Forward era, which will be divided into the following aspects.
    I. In terms of teaching quality, due to the launch of the work-study movement in 1958, followed by participation in the nationwide steelmaking campaign, the establishment of factories by the school, and the sending down of labor, and more importantly, because the school party committee resolutely implemented the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," for the first time in the history of the school, a situation emerged in which the majority of teachers and students participated in physical labor. This not only greatly improved their political awareness, established a labor perspective, cultivated feelings for workers and peasants, clarified the purpose of learning, and enhanced physical health, but also improved teaching quality. According to the school-wide statistics in April last year, comparing before and after productive labor, the number of people who passed accounted for 93.2% after labor, and 90% before labor, an increase of 3.2%. Among them, the number of people with excellent grades accounted for 53.25% after labor, and 39.65% before labor, an increase of 13.6%. The number of people who failed accounted for 6.8% after labor, and 10% before labor, a decrease of 3.2%. The improvement of teaching quality is not only due to the consolidation and verification of the theoretical knowledge learned in practice, but also through participating in productive labor, the ability to work in practice has been greatly cultivated, the level of technical operation has been improved, and the ability to think independently has been exercised.
    II. In terms of scientific research, before the Great Leap Forward, the scientific research work of our school can be said to be cold and desolate. In the five years from 1953 to 1957, only twenty-eight topics were completed. Some people, because they could not find materials and had no book basis, chose topics but did not dare to start. Some also chose topics, but because they did not follow the mass line, the result was nothing. For example, the architectural teaching and research group of our school selected the topic of "Investigation and Research on Hunan Folk Architecture" in the 1956 scientific research plan. At that time, only a few teachers sporadically conducted two investigations in Ningxiang County. After two years, nothing was achieved. It was not until the Great Leap Forward in 1958 that students were mobilized to conduct investigations in thirteen counties and cities. In less than two months, the scientific research tasks that had not been completed in the past two years were completed. 1958 was a year of great leap forward in the scientific and technological research work of our school. In this year, a total of 149 scientific research topics were completed, which is 5.1 times the total number of 29 topics completed in the past five years. There have also been significant changes in quality compared to the past. The outstanding change is: connecting with reality and combining with the construction cause of the motherland, changing the past situation of starting from personal interests and "science for science's sake," which was detached from reality and production. Among the 64 topics with higher quality, 53 topics are directly related to the country's production and construction. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the scientific research work of our school in 1959 was a situation of continued leap forward. Not only was the quantity large and the quality high, but most of them were more important scientific and technological topics in the current national production and construction. As for this year's scientific research plan, it is even more magnificent.
    III. In terms of productive labor, because education is combined with productive labor, it not only improves teaching quality and promotes scientific research, but also creates and saves a lot of wealth for the country. The Civil Engineering Department built a four-story building with a no-eye cavity wall of 5,199 square meters, and a "four-no hall" that can accommodate 3,000 seats (the so-called four no's are no wood, no cement, no steel, and no bricks). The Railway Engineering Department surveyed and designed a total of 172 kilometers of railways. The Bridge and Tunnel Department completed most of the bridge and tunnel projects of two bridges and one tunnel. The Chemical Engineering Department produced 156.3 tons of high-grade cement. The Machinery Factory produced 30 drilling machines and other products with a net value of about 600,000 yuan. Now, all teachers and students of the school are using their own hands to build a teaching main building as high as eight floors with a total area of more than 30,000 square meters. In short, participating in productive labor has opened a new history of the combination of teaching, production, and scientific research in our school.
    Fellow committee members, due to time constraints, I will only briefly talk about the leaps forward at Hunan University during the Great Leap Forward era. Now, I would like to talk about some of my personal thoughts and views before and after the Great Leap Forward. Speaking of this, I really have a feeling of "overwhelming the present over the past" and "the present is right and the past is wrong." I am a bourgeois intellectual. Because my thinking has not been thoroughly transformed and I have not established a correct proletarian worldview, I inevitably have some resistance to any new things before they are produced. The ancient saying "can share success, but difficult to share the beginning" reflects my ideological consciousness before and after treating new things. During the Great Leap Forward, when the Party put forward the education policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," I thought at the time that it was a matter of course for education to serve proletarian politics, so I did not express any opposing opinions. But how to do it to show that it serves proletarian politics? This truth was only understood after more than a year of teaching practice. When debating the policy of combining education with productive labor, I had more fallacies. I mistakenly believed that it was acceptable to regard productive labor as a means of transforming thinking and experiencing life, but it could not be regarded as the purpose of education. And I believed that if labor was not handled properly, it would not only reduce teaching quality, but also affect the physical and mental health of students. At that time, I thought this was the general trend, so I did not directly raise objections to combining with productive labor, and desperately emphasized the topic of labor should be combined with professional knowledge, and made articles on it. This was naturally a kind of lonely mood of retreating and seeking second best. After several repeated debates, I theoretically admitted defeat, but what will be the result of practice? I was holding a "wait and see" attitude. When debating "masses engaging in scientific research," I thought this policy was also unrealistic. At that time, although I did not necessarily think that scientific research was only a matter for experts, I always thought that scientific research results were the crystallization of all scientific knowledge. Without a relatively rich scientific foundation, how can we talk about engaging in scientific research? Newton saw an apple falling and invented gravity. Watt saw boiling water rushing through the lid and created the steam engine. In terms of phenomena, it seemed like a "flash of inspiration," but they were ultimately due to having a wealth of scientific knowledge before they touched their "inspiration." How can the masses without a scientific foundation engage in scientific research? After repeated debates, although I also theoretically admitted defeat, what was the result? I was still holding a "wait and see" attitude. How long ago, the results of my "waiting" have all "gone against my thinking." In the past two years, I have personally heard countless new things like myths, and personally seen man-made "miracles" like "divine craftsmanship." Whenever I face these "miracles," my thoughts and feelings are both happy and fearful. The happy mood is the same as the mood of the people. What I fear is that I feel that my thinking is too far behind the objective situation. Living in the great Mao Zedong era, living in the Great Leap Forward era under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, if we do not thoroughly transform our worldview, if we cannot be good at using the spirit of Chairman Mao's continuous revolution theory and revolutionary development stage theory in our work, then we will definitely be far behind new things, and we will definitely not be able to keep up with the new situation. This is such a dangerous thing. Through my own ideological practice in the past two years, especially after personally hearing the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of this meeting, I fully realized that I must strengthen my ideological transformation, and thus clarified the direction and method of self-transformation. I must bravely move forward on the road of transformation. I must regard 1960 as a year of great leap forward in my own thinking. A few days ago, Minister Li Zhuchen introduced to me a couplet by Chen Shu Lao, "Keep in mind the six hundred million people with one heart, see clearly the nine fingers with both eyes." These two sentences are of great practical educational significance to me. I have already asked Uncle Lao to write it out for me as my "motto" for treating and accepting new things in the future.
    Finally, I wish all committee members good health.

### 大跃进中的湖南大学  陈云章委员的发言

    大跃进中的湖南大学
    陈云章委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我现在向大会来汇报湖南大学在大跃进年代中的一些跃进情况，和我个人在大跃进前后的一些想法。
    讲起湖南大学历史来，截到现在止已有四十二年了，远在1918年开始筹备的时候，毛主席就住在筹备处作过很多的革命活动，这就替湖南大学创造了光辉的历史传统。可是这个学校在旧中国年代里，由于社会制度的关系，内战的关系，时停时办，经费缺乏，师资条件差，设备更差，至于教学质量就更谈不上了。1949年接收的时候，湖南大学的教师才一百九十三人，1959年度全校教师就有五百零四人，1954到1958年的五年间的学生毕业人数就等于旧中国1930到1949年的十九年时间的毕业人数的四倍多，谈到校舍建筑面积，和学校设备情况，那就更不好对比了，可以说，湖南大学的真正生命年龄是从解放后才开始的。
    解放十年来的湖南大学，由于形势的需要是经过了几次调整过程的，但各个方面的工作质量，都是不断在提高。1953年院系调整的时候，在原湖南大学的部分基础上组成中南土建学院，1958年扩充为多科性的湖南工学院，1959年在湖南工学院的基础上成立了文理工综合性的湖南大学，因此，新的湖南大学正是大跃进年代的产物。
    现在我首先来谈谈湖南大学在大跃进年代中的一些跃进情况，这分做下述几个内容来讲。
    一、教学质量方面，由于1958年开展了勤工俭学运动，以后又参加了全民炼钢，学校大办工厂，以及下放劳动，更由于我校党委坚决地执行了“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，在学校的历史上第一次出现了广大师生参加体力劳动的局面，这不仅大大地提高了政治觉悟，树立了劳动观点，培养了工农感情，明确了学习目的，增强了身体健康，而且提高了教学质量。根据我校去年4月份全校的统计，以生产劳动前后来作比较，及格的人数，劳动后占93.2％，劳动前占90％，提高了3.2％，其中成绩优良的，劳动后占53.25％，劳动前占39.65％，提高了13.6％，不及格的，劳动后占6.8％，劳动前占10％，下降了3.2％。教学质量的提高，不仅由于在实践中巩固与印证了所学的理论知识，而且通过参加生产劳动，大大培养了实际工作的本领，提高了技术操作水平，锻炼了独立思考能力。
    二、科学研究方面，在大跃进以前，我校的科研工作，真可说得是冷冷清清的，从1953年到1957年这五年内只完成了二十八个题目，有一些人则因找不到资料，无书本根据，选了题目，不敢动手。也有选择了题目，因没有走群众路线，结果也是一无所成，比如我校建筑教研组在1956年科研规划内就选定了“湖南民间建筑调查研究”一题，当时只由少数教师断断续续在宁乡县作了两次调查工作，事经两年，一无结果，直到1958年大跃进的时候，发动同学，深入到十三个县市进行调查，在不到两个月的时间里，便完成了过去两年多都没有完成的科研任务。1958年是我校科学技术研究工作大跃进的一年。这一年内共完成科研题目一百四十九个，为过去五年来完成题目总数二十九个的五点一倍，在质量上比过去也有显著的变化。突出的变化是：联系实际，结合祖国的建设事业，一改过去从个人兴趣出发，“为科学而科学”既脱离实际又离开生产的局面。其中质量较高的六十四个题目中，有五十三题是直接与国家的生产建设有关的。在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年我校的科研工作，更是一个继续跃进的局面，不但数量多，质量高，而且大都为目前国家生产建设中较为重要的科学技术课题，至于今年的科研规划，那就更波澜壮阔了。
    三、生产劳动方面，由于教育结合生产劳动，不但提高了教学质量，推动了科研工作，而且替国家创造与节约了大量财富。土木系建成了一栋五千一百九十九平方米的无眼空斗墙四层大楼，和一所能容纳三千个座位的“四无大厅”（所谓四无，就是无木料、无水泥、无钢筋、无砖瓦），铁建系共勘测设计了一百七十二公里铁路，桥隧系完成了两桥一洞的大部分桥梁隧道工程，化工系生产高标号水泥一百五十六点三吨，机械厂生产钻床三十台等产品，净值约六十万元，现在全校师生正在用自己的双手，建造一所高达八层总面积达三万多平方米的教学主楼。总之，参加生产劳动，揭开了我校教学，生产，科研三结合的新的历史。
    各位委员，关于湖南大学在大跃进年代中的跃进情况，由于时间的关系，我就只概略地讲述到这儿为止。现在我再来谈谈我个人在大跃进前后的一些想法与看法。讲到这里，真使我有“不胜今昔”“今是昨非”之感，我是一个资产阶级知识分子，由于自己的思想没有得到彻底的改造，没有树立正确的无产阶级世界观，因此，在任何新事物产生之前，总难免有一些抵触情绪，古人讲的“可与乐成，难与虑始”这句话，正反映了我对待新事物前后的思想意识，在大跃进时期，当党提出“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针时，我当时对教育为无产阶级政治服务这点，认为这是理所当然的事，因此没有体现出相反的言论，但要怎样做才算是体现了为无产阶级政治服务？这道理是直到通过这一年多来的教学实践后才明白的。当辩论教育结合生产劳动这方针时，我的谬论就多了，我错误地认为把生产劳动当做一个改造思想，体验生活的手段是可以的，但不能作为教育的目的，并认为劳动如处理的不适当，不但会降低教学质量，而且会影响学生的身心健康，我当时认为这是大势所趋，因而没有正面提出反对结合生产劳动的意见，拼命地在强调劳动应结合专业这题目上兜圈子，做文章，这自然是出于无可奈何退而求其次的一种落寞心情，通过若干次的反复辩论后，我在理论上是认输了，但实践的结果将是怎样呢？我是抱着一个“等着瞧”的态度的。在辩论“群众大搞科研”时，我认为这方针也是不切合实际的，我当时虽不一定认为搞科研这只是专家的事，但我总认为科研成果是一切科学知识的结晶，没有较为丰富的科学基础知识，怎能谈得上搞科研呢？牛顿看到苹果落地，发明了地心引力，瓦特看到沸水冲盖，创造了蒸汽机，在现象上说，仿佛是“灵机一动”，但他们毕竟是由于先有了丰富的科学知识，才触动了他们的“灵机”的，没有科学基础的群众，怎能搞科研呢？在经过反复辩论后，我在理论上虽也认输了，但结果怎样？我仍是抱着一个“等着瞧”的态度，曾几何时，我“瞧”的结果，都“事与思违”了。这两年来，我亲耳听到的层出不穷的像神话一般的新鲜事物，亲眼看到的像“鬼斧神工”似的人造“奇迹”，何止万千，感慨千万，每当我面对这些“奇迹”时，我的思想感情是一则以喜，一则以惧的。喜的心情与人民群众的心情是一致的，所惧的就是感到自己的思想太赶不上客观形势了。生活在伟大的毛泽东时代里、生活在毛泽东思想指导下的大跃进时代里，如不彻底地改造自己的世界观，如不能在工作中善于运用毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的精神实质，那就一定会远远地抛在新事物的后面，那就一定会远远地赶不上新的形势，这是何等危险的事。通过自己这两年来的思想实践，尤其是这次亲耳听到了两位李副总理的报告，和本会陈叔通副主席的工作报告，我充分地意识到非加强自己的思想改造不可，从而也明确了自我改造的方向与方法，我一定要在改造的道路上勇往迈进，我一定要把1960年当做我自己思想上大跃进的一年。前几天，李烛尘部长向我介绍陈叔老的一副对联“一心记住六亿人口，两眼看清九个指头”，这两句话对我来说，真是太有现实教育意义了，我已经请求叔老亲笔给我写出来，作为我今后对待新事物接受新事物的“座右铭”。
    最后，祝各位委员同志健康。
