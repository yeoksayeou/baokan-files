    Rely on the Masses, Use Indigenous Methods, County-Run Backbone Factories, Communes Build Small Factories
    Dayi County Establishes Chemical Industry Network
    The County Produces More Than 130 Kinds of Chemical Products, Promoting the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture and Industry
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 25th dispatch) Dayi County, Sichuan Province, is vigorously developing the chemical industry using indigenous methods. It has now established seventeen county-run "small-scale indigenous groups" chemical factories; twenty-nine people's communes each have a comprehensive chemical factory capable of producing a variety of products, and one or several seasonally-operated indigenous fertilizer and indigenous pesticide factories. The entire county, with county-run chemical factories as the backbone, tightly integrates county and commune chemical industries, forming a chemical industry network.
    Dayi County's chemical industry developed from scratch in 1958. Through continuous consolidation, strengthening, and improvement, it is now able to produce more than 130 kinds of products, including pesticides, veterinary medicines, chemical fertilizers, and acids and alkalis. The quality of these products is also very good. For example, sulfuric acid produced by indigenous methods has a concentration of up to 94%; soda ash contains more than 60% sodium carbonate; and veterinary oxytetracycline has more than 2,000 units per gram. Calculated based on the production capacity of each chemical factory, this year the pesticides and chemical fertilizers produced by the county can supply an average of more than 2,000 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per mu (including indigenous fertilizer) and about 50 kilograms of pesticides for the county's 800,000 mu of cultivated land.
    In developing the chemical industry, Dayi County conscientiously implemented the principle of focusing on serving the countryside and primarily serving agricultural production and diversified economy. According to a typical survey conducted by a production team of Jinping Commune, the mixed use of humic acid sodium respiratory fertilizer and general fertilizer, under the same conditions, resulted in an average yield increase of 10% per mu of rice compared to rice without the use of humic acid sodium, and a 25% increase in wheat yield. In the first quarter of this year, 89,058 pigs have been immunized.
    The chemical industry "small-scale indigenous groups" have also vigorously supported industrial production. Most of the sulfuric acid, explosives, indigenous detonators, etc. needed by the county's smelting, mining, and transportation construction departments can be solved locally. Basic chemical products such as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and soda ash have also supported other counties in the Wenjiang Special District.
    In order to better leverage the role of county and commune chemical industries in serving agriculture and large-scale industry, this year, in addition to focusing on expanding the production of major products such as pesticides, veterinary medicines, fertilizers, veterinary oxytetracycline, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda in terms of variety, each chemical factory will also, in conjunction with the technical transformation of "small-scale indigenous groups," vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in terms of equipment, technology, tools, and operation to further improve output and quality.
    In the process of developing the chemical industry, this county has also created many valuable experiences in technology. For example, high-grade materials such as corrosion-resistant steel are generally required for the Western method of producing sulfuric acid. In the absence of steel, they used foamed sandstone to build converters; in the absence of Western blowers, they used wooden blowers instead; and in the absence of acid pumps, they used manual circulation. They also produced qualified "contact method" sulfuric acid using indigenous methods. By using this indigenous method, the total investment is less than 2,000 yuan, and a sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 400 tons can be built in a few days.
    Dayi County's experience in developing the chemical industry with indigenous methods has received attention from many regions. Since last year, more than 20 provinces and cities across the country have sent people to visit and study. (Attached picture)
    Oxytetracycline produced by the Dayi County "March 8th" Antibiotic Factory is a good medicine for raising and fattening poultry and livestock. This rooster (left picture) ate this oxytetracycline and grew to four catties and four taels in three months, about two catties more than an ordinary rooster. Our reporter You Yungu photographed.

    靠群众　用土法　县办骨干厂　社社建小厂
    大邑县建起化学工业网
    全县生产一百三十多种化工产品，促进了工农业生产大跃进
    本报成都25日电　四川省大邑县用土办法大办化学工业。现在已办起十七个县属“小土群”化工厂；二十九个人民公社也都各有一个能生产多种产品的综合性化工厂，一个或数个季节性生产的土化肥、土农药厂。全县以县办化工厂为骨干，县社化学工业紧密结合，形成了一个化学工业网。
    大邑县的化学工业是1958年从无到有发展起来的。经过不断整顿、巩固和提高，现在已能生产农药、兽药、化学肥料和酸、碱等一百三十多种产品。这些产品的质量也很好。例如，用土法生产的硫酸，浓度达到94％；纯碱含炭酸钠在60％以上；畜用土霉素每克在二千单位以上。按各化工厂生产能力计算，今年这个县生产的农药、化学肥料，可供全县八十万亩耕地平均每亩使用化学肥料二千公斤以上（包括土化肥），农药五十公斤左右。
    大邑县在发展化学工业中，认真贯彻了面向农村，为农业生产和多种经济服务为主的方针。据锦屏公社一个生产队的典型调查，用呼吸肥料胡敏酸钠与一般肥料混合使用，在同等条件下，使用了胡敏酸钠的水稻比没有使用的水稻平均每亩增产10％，小麦增产25％。今年第一季度已有八万九千零五十八头猪进行了免疫注射。
    化学工业“小土群”还有力地支援了工业生产。全县冶炼、采矿、交通建设等部门所需要的硫酸、炸药、土雷管等大部分都可以就地解决。硫酸、烧碱、纯碱等基本化工产品，还支援了温江专区其他各县。
    为了更好地发挥县社化学工业为农业和大工业服务的作用，今年各化工厂除了在品种上着重扩大农药、兽药、化肥、畜用土霉素、硫酸、烧碱等主要产品生产外，还结合“小土群”的技术改造，从设备、工艺、工具、操作上大闹技术革新和技术革命，来进一步提高产量和质量。
    这个县在发展化学工业的过程中，在技术上还创造了许多宝贵的经验。例如洋法生产硫酸一般都要用耐腐蚀的钢材等高级材料。他们在没有钢材的情况下，利用泡砂石砌转化器；没有洋鼓风机就用木质鼓风机代替；没有酸泵，就用人工循环。用土办法同样生产出了质量合格的“接触法”硫酸。采用这种土办法，全部投资不到二千元，几天就可以建成一座年产四百吨的硫酸厂。
    大邑县用土办法发展化学工业的经验，受到了许多地区的重视。从去年到现在，全国已有二十多个省、市先后派人前来参观和学习。（附图片）
