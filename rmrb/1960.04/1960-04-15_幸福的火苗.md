    The collective canteen of the Jiangzhuang Production Team in the Dengmingsi Commune is a model canteen in our Jiahe County. It was established the earliest and is run the best. I went there the day before yesterday and happened to be there when the Party branch and the commune members were discussing the construction of a dining hall. Originally, they only wanted to build a simple shed to provide shade in the summer and shelter from the wind and rain. However, the commune members disagreed. They said that the collective canteen is a big family for collective living and a cause of communism, so it must be built well. Even if the current economic conditions are not met, the location and style must be well designed, and the foundation must be solid enough to withstand an eight-story building. For now, we will start simply with a basic dining hall, and with the development of the people's commune, we will add bricks and tiles and continuously improve it.

    These words kept rolling around in my head, and the more I thought about them, the more interesting they became. What I was thinking about was not whether the practice of building a simple dining hall first and then developing it into a standard dining hall was scientific or not, nor was I thinking about whether Jiangzhuang would ultimately be a residential area in a communist society. What I was thinking about was the people's commune members' constant yearning, belief, and vision for communism. From building an ordinary dining hall, they thought of the communist high-rise buildings of tomorrow. The commune members who join the "canteen" do not just come and go like they are eating in a restaurant, eating their fill and leaving. Instead, they cherish ideals and use their real lives to cultivate and look forward to the growth of communist sprouts. They know that with the growth of these sprouts, the current scattered living units of one village or one estate, one family or one household, will converge into the residential points of the people's commune, and the countryside will enter urbanization. Nowadays, collective canteens, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, commune-run factories, and so on, show and attract people to organize their scattered lives through the seeds of a happy life and the advantages conducive to production. Thinking about it this way, the significance of building a dining hall is more than just the convenience of eating. People's communist spirit will also take shape in this dining hall, and the dining hall itself also signifies the existence and development of the people's commune. Firmly laying the foundation of the dining hall means laying the cornerstone of the people's commune.

    The collective canteen, this communist seedling, has a strong vitality. Because collective eating facilitates unified action and is conducive to the collective labor of large-scale production, it is a guarantee for the great leap in production. All commune members gather here three times a day for meals, meetings, study, and cultural entertainment. This is the political, economic, and cultural center for the members of the people's commune, a school for carrying out communist education and developing communist style. Every production team in every people's commune cannot do without it, and no one can be without it. The collective canteen is the cornerstone of the people's commune. The commune members said it well: "The collective canteen is the apple of our eye, the foundation of the people's commune, and our socialist position."

    As the east wind blows vigorously, the cooking fires of the people's commune collective canteen are burning brighter and brighter, burning away all the old habits of individual life! The flame of communism has risen in people's hearts. This is the flame of happiness. As the flame of happiness spreads, people see the bright picture of tomorrow. The desire, belief, and vision for tomorrow encourage people to move forward with confidence on the road of socialism!

    幸福的火苗	焦合文
    灯明寺公社姜庄生产队的集体食堂，是我们交河县的标兵食堂，办的最早，办的最好。前天，我去那里一趟。正赶上党支部和社员们商量建饭厅的事。原来只想搭个饭棚子，能够夏天遮荫、避风雨就行。可是社员们不同意。他们说集体食堂是集体生活的大家庭，是共产主义的事业，一定要建设得好一些。即是目前经济条件达不到，也要把地点、式样设计好，地脚要夯实，要能顶住八起的大楼。现在先是因陋就简，建个简易饭厅，随着人民公社的发展，再添砖加瓦，不断改进。
    这一番话，老是在我脑子里打滚，越琢磨越有味。我想的不是先建简易饭厅然后发展成为标准饭厅的做法科学与否，也不是想的姜庄这个地点到共产主义社会究竟是不是个居民点，我想的是人民公社社员们对共产主义那种时时刻刻的热望、信念和远见。他们从建立一座普通的饭厅，就想到了明天的共产主义高楼大厦。公社社员们入伙吃“食堂”，并非像下饭馆那样，出出入入，吃饱就走，而是怀着理想，用自己的现实生活培植和期待共产主义萌芽的成长。他们知道，随着这种萌芽的成长，现在的一村一庄，一家一户，星星点点的生活单位，将汇流成为人民公社的居民点，乡村进入城市化。如今，一所所的集体食堂、幼儿园、敬老院、社办工厂等等，用幸福生活的苗头和利于生产的优越性，显示着、吸引着人们把分散的生活组织起来。这么想来，建饭厅，意义岂止于吃饭方便，人们的共产主义精神面貌也要在这座饭厅里形成，而这座饭厅本身也意味着人民公社的存在和发展。夯实饭厅的地脚，就是奠定人民公社的基石。
    集体食堂，这棵共产主义幼芽，富有强大的生命力。由于集体吃饭，便于统一行动，有利于大生产的集体劳动，它是生产大跃进的保证；全体社员一天三餐和天天凑在这里开会、学习和文化娱乐。这里是人民公社社员们政治、经济、文化的中心，是进行共产主义教育，锻炼共产主义风格的学校。哪个人民公社的生产队也少不得它，哪个人也离不得它，少不了它。集体食堂是人民公社的基石。听社员们说得好：“集体食堂就是我们的心尖子，就是人民公社的墙脚，是我们社会主义的阵地。”
    东风劲吹，人民公社集体食堂的炊火越着越旺，它烧掉了一切旧的个体生活的习气！在人们的心灵里升起了共产主义的火苗，这是幸福的火苗。幸福的火苗燎原，人们看到了明天的灿烂图景。对明天的渴望、信念和远见，鼓舞着人们满怀信心地在社会主义大道上前进！
