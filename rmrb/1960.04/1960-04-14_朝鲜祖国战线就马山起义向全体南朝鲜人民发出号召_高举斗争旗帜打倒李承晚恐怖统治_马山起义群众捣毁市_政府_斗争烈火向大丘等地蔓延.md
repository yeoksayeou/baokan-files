Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th - Pyongyang newspapers today published the "Appeal to the People of South Korea" passed by the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea on the 12th regarding the popular uprising of the people of Masan against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee.

The "Appeal to the People of South Korea" stated that the people of South Korea can no longer endure the pain and disaster brought about by the fascist terrorist rule of Syngman Rhee for more than ten years. The US imperialists must be made to withdraw, the fascist terrorist rule of Syngman Rhee must be ended immediately, and genuine democratic elections must be guaranteed, with genuine representatives of workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life participating in the government. In order to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland through democratic North-South Korean general elections by the Korean people themselves, we must unite our forces.

The "Appeal to the People of South Korea" stated that all the people in the northern half of the Republic fully support and support the struggle of the citizens of Masan and the people of South Korea for democratic rights and freedoms and to overthrow the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee.

The "Appeal to the People of South Korea" pointed out: "The brave struggle of the citizens and young students of Masan is an eruption of the volcano-like anger of all the people of South Korea groaning under the tyranny of the Syngman Rhee clique. They represent the unanimous will of all South Korean compatriots." It said that in this severe moment, no one with a national conscience, whoever they may be, can remain silent and stand idly by. The Korean people, who have inherited the glorious will of the patriotic revolutionary martyrs, cannot sit idly by and watch their brothers suffer barbaric suppression and slaughter. All South Korean people must actively support the just struggle of the people of Masan and raise the banner of struggle together with them.

The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea calls on all South Korean compatriots, brothers and sisters, to unite all forces in order to abolish the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, strive for national independence and democratic rights, and for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th - Seoul News: The fierce struggle of the people of Masan, South Korea, against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee continues to develop. On the 12th, tens of thousands more citizens held a massive demonstration and bravely engaged in fierce fighting with the police who were suppressing them.

According to Busan Radio Station, 30,000 people took to the streets that day.

According to the South Korean News Agency, the uprising struggle reached its climax on the evening of the 12th, and the enraged masses, like angry waves, stormed into the Masan City "Government" of the Syngman Rhee clique, smashed all the equipment inside to pieces, and tore up and threw away the "official documents" and "family registers" by which the Syngman Rhee clique oppressed and extorted the people. They also attacked the Central-dong police station of the Syngman Rhee clique's police, the Masan prison, and the residences of Syngman Rhee's lackeys.

Around 9 p.m., more than 4,000 uprising masses engaged in hand-to-hand combat with more than 300 police officers at the Masan Police Station, who were firing at the masses and using water cannons and tear gas to suppress the people. The masses destroyed the police's two fire trucks equipped with water cannons and other jeeps.

Around 10 p.m. that night, when a large number of people heard that the Syngman Rhee clique's Gyeongsangnam-do governor and the provincial police chief were meeting in the Changwon-gun "government" office to discuss how to suppress the people, several thousand people immediately shouted slogans of "Kill them!" and surrounded the Changwon-gun "government" office, smashing the glass windows and electric lights with stones. The angry masses stormed into the meeting room where they were meeting, causing this group of executioners to flee in all directions with their heads in their hands. The police chief of Gyeongsangnam-do, surnamed Lee, was so frightened that he crawled under the table.

On this day, from the morning onwards, thousands of students from various schools demonstrated in the streets. They lined up in neat formations, shouting slogans such as "Political corruption has reached the extreme," "Demand democracy," "The March 15th election is invalid!" "Arrest the police who tortured the people!" Even more than 700 female students from the First Girls' High School and Masan Nursing High School joined the demonstration. They repeatedly demonstrated between New Masan and Old Masan, centering on the Provincial Hospital, Central Street, and the Police Station. The streets were lined with crowds who applauded and cheered the demonstrators and then joined the demonstration.

Despite the Syngman Rhee clique's barbaric suppression, the people of Masan continued to wage the struggle against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee on the 13th. According to Tonghwa News Agency, around 10 a.m. today, more than 400 students and citizens gathered in the Namseong-dong area of Masan and broke through the police cordon armed with knives and guns to hold a demonstration. This news agency also reported that around 11 a.m. today, more than 100 university students from Haein University in Masan broke through the police cordon and took to the streets to demonstrate, shouting at the police: "Our land has already been stained with blood, are you still firing guns?" Subsequently, many high school and middle school students joined their ranks. Thousands of people along the way warmly applauded and supported the students' demonstration. The Syngman Rhee clique's police authorities sent more than 100 armed police to suppress them and fired more than 50 shots, but could not frighten the demonstrating citizens and students.

Around 8 a.m. this morning, many people gathered in front of the Provincial Hospital to hold a demonstration. The Syngman Rhee clique's police rushed to threaten the masses, but the masses did not disperse. Two or three old ladies stepped out from the crowd with their chests out and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with the police.

The flames of the people of Masan's struggle against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee are spreading to other cities and regions. According to reports, the people of Daegu and Changwon-gun also held demonstrations on the 12th. The demonstrators threw stones at the Syngman Rhee clique's police stations. More than 300 members of the Democratic Party, the Syngman Rhee clique's opponents, also participated in the people of Daegu's struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique's fascist rule.

    新华社平壤13日电　平壤各报今天刊载了朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会12日就马山人民举行反对李承晚法西斯统治的人民起义通过的告南朝鲜人民书。
    告南朝鲜人民书说，南朝鲜人民再也不能忍受李承晚法西斯恐怖统治在十多年来带给的痛苦和灾难了。必须使美帝国主义者撤走，必须立即结束李承晚法西斯恐怖统治，必须保障有工人、农民等各界各阶层人民的真正代表参政的真正的民主选举。为了由朝鲜人民自己通过民主的南北朝鲜总选举，实现祖国的和平统一，要把力量团结起来。
    告南朝鲜人民书说，全体共和国北半部人民完全支持和声援马山市民和南朝鲜人民为了要求民主权利和自由、为了打倒李承晚反动统治进行的斗争。
    告南朝鲜人民书指出：“马山市民和青年学生的勇敢的斗争，是呻吟在李承晚集团暴政下的全体南朝鲜人民的火山般的愤怒的爆发。他们代表了全体南朝鲜同胞一致的意志。”它说，在这个严峻的时刻，只要有民族良心的人，不管是谁，都不能保持沉默和袖手旁观。继承了爱国的革命先烈的光荣意志的朝鲜人民，怎能坐视自己的兄弟遭受野蛮的镇压和屠杀。全体南朝鲜人民必须积极支持马山人民的正义斗争，并同他们一道高高举起斗争的旗帜。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会号召南朝鲜全体同胞兄弟姐妹们，为了废除李承晚集团的法西斯统治，争取民族独立和民主权利，为了祖国的和平统一，把一切力量团结起来。
    新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜马山市人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的激烈斗争在继续发展中。12日，又有数万名市民举行了声势浩大的示威，并且英勇地同镇压他们的警察展开了剧烈的搏斗。
    据釜山广播电台说：这一天有三万人上了街。
    据南朝鲜通讯社报道，12日晚上起义斗争达到了高潮，怒不可遏的群众像怒涛一样冲进了李承晚集团的马山市“政府”，把里面的所有设备捣得稀烂，并把李承晚集团压迫和勒索人民的“公文”、“户籍簿”等都拿出来撕毁、扔掉了。他们还袭击了李承晚集团警察的中央洞派出所、马山的刑务所和李承晚走狗的住宅。
    晚上九时左右，四千多名起义群众在马山警察署同向群众开枪并用水龙和催泪弹镇压人民的三百多名警察进行肉搏。群众把警察的两辆装着水龙的消防车和另外的吉普车都捣毁了。
    这天晚上十时左右，当大批群众听到李承晚集团庆尚南道的道知事和道警察局长等在昌原郡“政府”办公厅内开会讨论如何镇压人民的消息后，立刻就有数千名群众高呼
  “打死他们！”的口号，包围了昌原郡“政府”办公厅，用石块打碎了玻璃窗和电灯。愤怒的群众冲进了他们开会的会议室，把这一群刽子手打得向四处抱头鼠窜，庆尚南道姓李的警察局长吓得钻到桌子底下去。
    这一天，从上午起就有数千名各学校的学生在街上示威。他们排列着整齐的队伍，高呼：“政治腐败透顶了”、“要求民主”、“3月15日的选举是无效的！”、“把拷问人民的警察抓起来！”等口号。连第一女子高等学校和马山护士高等学校的七百多名女学生也加入了示威的行列。她们以道立医院、中央大街、警察署为中心，在新马山和旧马山之间反复来回地进行示威游行。街道两旁站满了群众，他们都对示威的人们鼓掌喝彩，并随即汇合到示威队伍中去。
    尽管李承晚集团进行野蛮的镇压，马山市人民在13日继续展开反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争。据同和通讯社报道，今天上午十时左右，又有学生和市民四百多人在马山南城洞一带集合，冲破拿着刀枪的警察所布下的警戒网举行示威。这家通讯社还报道说，今天上午十一时左右，马山市的海丘大学一百多名大学生冲破警察的警戒线，上街示威，他们对警察高呼：“鲜血已经染红了我们的国土了，你们还放枪吗？”接着许多高等学校学生和中学生陆续加入了他们的队伍。沿途数千名群众热烈鼓掌声援学生们的示威。李承晚集团警察当局派了一百多名武装警察去镇压，并且开枪五十多发，但是吓不倒示威的市民和学生。
    今晨八时左右，还有很多群众聚集在道立医院前面，要举行示威。李承晚集团警察赶去威胁群众，但群众并没有散开。有两三位老太太从群众中挺胸走出，同警察进行面对面的斗争。
    马山市人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争烽火正在向其他城市和地方蔓延。据报道，大丘市和昌原郡人民在12日也举行了示威。示威群众向李承晚集团警察署投掷石块。李承晚集团的对手——民主党的三百多党员也参加了大丘市人民反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的斗争。（附图片）
