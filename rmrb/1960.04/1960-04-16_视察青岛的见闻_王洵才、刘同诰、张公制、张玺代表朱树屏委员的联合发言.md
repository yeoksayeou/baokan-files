We enthusiastically support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian to the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress on the "Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and the "Draft State Budget for 1959 and the State Budget Draft for 1960." These two reports accurately reflect the heroic posture of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party in actively and enthusiastically building socialism and achieving an all-round and sustained leap forward. They correctly point out the goals and working principles for this year, greatly boosting our confidence and drive to strive for a greater leap forward and greater victory in 1960.

Prior to this conference, we conducted an inspection tour in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, visiting Qingdao No. 3 Steel Plant, Textile Machinery Factory, Qingdao Bicycle Factory, Qingdao Integrated Timber Processing Plant, Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory, the Fujiapu Production Brigade of Xifuzhen People's Commune, the Shagou Brigade of Xiazhuang People's Commune, the Zhaocun Production Team of Xianjiazhai People's Commune, the Shilaoren Production Team of the Sino-Korean People's Commune, Shandong Ocean University, Qingdao No. 2 Middle School, Jiangsu Road Primary School, and the Hankou Road Street Office. During the inspection, we saw everywhere inspiring examples of the high-speed development of various undertakings and the magnificent scene of leap forward after leap forward. Everywhere, the socialist construction undertakings in Qingdao City, like other parts of the country, showed that 1959 was another more comprehensive and better continuing leap forward based on the great leap forward of 1958. The "red opening" on various fronts this year also showed a similar great leap forward. This inspection was an actual socialist education lesson for us, which greatly inspired us and made us further realize the correctness of all the Party's guidelines and policies, that the general line and the great leap forward are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, and that the three magic weapons, once grasped by the masses, generate great material strength in socialist construction.

I. Under the guidance of the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, our country has achieved great accomplishments in developing the steel industry, and the mass steelmaking movement has blossomed and borne fruit everywhere. In the autumn of 1958, the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to take steel as the key link for an all-round leap forward and for the whole Party and all the people to engage in steel production. The entire citizenry of Qingdao City immediately threw themselves into the vigorous steelmaking movement. The Qingdao No. 3 Steel Plant that we inspected is a product of this great steelmaking movement. Like other steel plants in Qingdao, it started from scratch, building furnaces on barren land, starting from nothing, working hard and cleverly, developing from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, constructing while producing. The workers were all from the countryside in 1958, and knew nothing about how to make steel. Under the Party's training and education, they have become steelmaking experts, realizing the slogan "making steel also makes people." At present, all the workers in the plant are in high spirits and full of energy, determined to overfulfill the 1960 task. Qingdao Bicycle Factory started with indigenous steelmaking in 1958, and now has a fully equipped steelmaking workshop, producing more than 2,000 tons of good steel per month. The nationally known 0.5-ton small converter can produce first-grade steel with a rate of over 95%. In addition to being self-sufficient, the steel produced by this factory also supports 47 units in ten provinces, including Liaoning, Qinghai, Gansu, and Guizhou. At the same time, Qingdao, like other parts of the country, has taken steel as the key link in industrial construction, driving the great development of other industries. The situation in Qingdao and the many examples reflected by representatives and committee members in the panel discussions all eloquently demonstrate that the seeds of the national steelmaking campaign in 1958 have sprouted, branched out, blossomed, and borne fruit throughout the country. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, at present, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the country, except Tibet, have steel enterprises. The small indigenous groups that started construction in 1958, especially ironmaking, steelmaking, and coal mining enterprises, have, after rectification and improvement, expanded their production scale, improved their technical level, and developed into enterprises using foreign methods or a combination of foreign and indigenous methods, playing an increasingly important role in production and construction. The Qingdao No. 3 Steel Plant and the Qingdao Bicycle Factory that we inspected are very realistic examples of this. We firmly believe that these steel enterprises that started with "small indigenous groups" in 1958 will play a greater role in completing this year's and subsequent steel production tasks, and we also firmly believe that the planned target of producing 18.4 million tons of good steel in 1960 will definitely be completed and overfulfilled. This shows that the Party Central Committee's policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, as well as the set of "simultaneous development" policies that have been effective for the past two years, such as simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, simultaneously promoting central and local industries, simultaneously promoting large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously promoting foreign and indigenous production methods, are wise and correct, and can ensure the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy.

II. The people's communes do have strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. During our inspection of the four people's communes, we felt everywhere that the face of the countryside and the fields is changing rapidly. The two villages that make up the Fujiapu Production Brigade of Xifuzhen People's Commune and the Shagou Village of Xiazhuang People's Commune used to be poor mountains and ravines, with frequent floods and barren farmland. The lives of the villagers were extremely difficult. The working people could not get enough to eat all year round and often had to go out to beg for food. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the poverty of the mountainous areas was gradually changed. After the people's communes were established in 1958, the enthusiasm of the commune members soared, and a climax of mountain and water management was set off. By last spring, they had basically reached the requirements for higher standards of soil and water conservation, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery had been fully developed. The Fujiapu Production Team has basically realized tenizations, namely: 1. Mountainous areas are gardenized, 2. Slopes are terraced and leveled, 3. Farmland is irrigated, 4. Irrigation is self-flowing, 5. Cultivated land is gardenized, 6. Four sides are greened, 7. Ravines and valleys are reservoirized, 8. Aquatic products are diversified, 9. Mountain roads are trafficized, and 10. Engineering is systematized. This has greatly changed the face of the mountainous area. The commune members praised it, saying, "Distant mountains are high mountains with forests, nearby mountains are low mountains with orchards, fruit trees are connected on and under the mountains, peach blossoms are red and willows are green, and hundreds of flowers are competing for beauty; the former poor mountains and bad waters of Fujiapu are now a rich and beautiful big garden." The average income per person in 1959 was 85 yuan. One hundred percent of the residents eat in public canteens. People's lives have been significantly improved with nurseries, kindergartens, maternity homes, and homes for the elderly. The welfare undertakings and the method of using the Huilong fire pit to make sweet potatoes produce more sprouts in the Shagou Production Team are even more outstanding.

Similarly, after the establishment of the commune in Zhaocun Production Team in 1958, there was also leap forward after leap forward. In another environmental condition, a year of hard work has changed the face of nature and basically realized another type of tenizations in this riverine plain area: 1. Water conservancy is mechanized with wells, 2. Irrigation is mechanized and electrified, 3. Drainage and irrigation machinery management is specialized, 4. Land is deep-plowed and leveled, 5. Cultivation is gardenized, 6. Land is divided into squares, 7. Irrigation channels are systematized, 8. Roads are standardized and tidy, 9. Four sides are greened, beautified, and scented, and 10. Aquatic products are diversified. There is a double harvest of grain and vegetables, and the lives of the commune members have been greatly improved.

The Shilaoren Production Team of the Sino-Korean People's Commune is another type: fishing is the main occupation and agriculture is the subsidiary occupation. After the establishment of the commune, the number of boats, nets, and tools has greatly increased. This May, they will strive to mechanize the net-lifting, to mechanize and semi-mechanize the rear processing. They have also created a set of operating methods that can double productivity without increasing the number of boats or manpower.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun correctly pointed out again in his report that the people's commune is the best social grassroots organization for accelerating our country's socialist construction. In 1959, under the circumstances that 30% of the national sown area suffered serious disasters, our country's agricultural production continued to achieve a great leap forward, which proves that the people's commune has strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. Indeed, like the several commune production teams in the mountainous areas, plains, and mainly engaged in marine fishing that we inspected, they have all developed on the basis of poverty. There were serious disasters on land and sea last year, but the changes in the face of nature and the improvement of people's lives in the past two years are still so great and so fast! If it were not for the large and public people's communes that can fully mobilize the people's enthusiasm and creativity, and have strong vitality and unparalleled superiority, it would be unimaginable.

Now, as Vice Premier Li said in his report, the urban people across the country are enthusiastically and actively running people's communes, running street industries, suburban agriculture, public canteens, and various welfare service undertakings, further organizing the economic and cultural life of residents and transforming the social appearance of cities. This is really a major and happy event that is encouraging and inspiring! There is no doubt that this new and great development of the urban people's commune movement will play an important and active role in realizing the magnificent plan for continued leap forward in 1960 and subsequent sustained leap forward mentioned in the reports of the two vice premiers. In addition to enthusiastically and actively participating in urban people's communes ourselves and with our families, we will also mobilize the people we contact to actively participate. Further organizing the city's economy and the lives of its residents according to the needs of social development, and further collectivizing it, can thoroughly change the organizational appearance of the old city, and make the relations of production more suitable for the development of productive forces. It can enable industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, health, and other departments to more effectively support agricultural technical transformation. At the same time, this will definitely have a positive significance and an extremely beneficial and important influence on accelerating the transformation of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, and on fundamentally changing the spiritual outlook of the urban people.

III. Education serves proletarian politics and is combined with productive labor, which has greatly improved the quality of teaching and the professional and ideological level of teachers.

In order to ensure the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education being combined with productive labor," various colleges, middle schools, and primary schools in Qingdao, in addition to being assigned by the city to industrial and agricultural production according to the needs of Qingdao's work, have also vigorously established factories as production labor bases for teachers and students. Taking Qingdao No. 2 Middle School as an example, at the time of our inspection, there were already ten factories and sixteen workshops actually engaged in production, with more than 20 kinds of products and relatively high quality. The newly built workshops include wood powder glue laminate, artificial marble, and electroplating, and they have basically achieved labor baseization and are gradually normalizing production, systemizing management, and mechanizing operations. At present, they are taking the machinery factory as the key link, and focusing on the kelp farm, crucible factory, and electroplating factory to drive the development and improvement of other factories. Before "July 1," they will gradually achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization. In the process of labor, the academic performance of students in some basic courses related to productive labor, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, has greatly improved and consolidated. Because teachers must work with students to study and solve the problems that constantly arise in productive labor, their research ability and professional level have been significantly improved in a short period of time. At the same time, many specific examples prove that the practice of productive labor does accelerate the socialist awareness and enthusiasm for socialist construction of both teachers and students.

The students of the Oceanography Department of Shandong Ocean University, the entire grade and class, participated in a year-long national comprehensive marine survey. On the one hand, they assisted in the completion of the national comprehensive marine survey task, and on the other hand, they truly learned and mastered the knowledge and technology of all aspects of marine survey in their work. At the same time, they overcame the fear of sea waves and seasickness, loved the ocean, and strengthened their determination to conquer and utilize the ocean and dedicate themselves to the great marine cause of the motherland. The collective organizational and disciplinary life during the investigation period was indeed a lesson in communist education for them. After returning to school, their understanding of the content of classroom teaching has been significantly improved, and their lifestyle has also made significant progress.

The inspection of university, middle school, and primary school education this time has made us further realize the correctness of the Party's education policy, that the combination of education and productive labor not only improves the quality of teaching in terms of coursework, but also exercises the physique in labor; in terms of collective life, it is a very effective way to cultivate creativity, revolutionary spirit, and many other communist qualities. Vice Premier Li Fuchun correctly pointed out in his report that "in developing education, we must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics and education being combined with productive labor." We believe that this is completely correct.

IV. In order to accelerate the development of socialist construction and ensure the completion or overfulfillment of this year's construction plan, the whole country and all the people must vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. Qingdao City, like other parts of the country, the broad masses of workers and staff have actively participated in the vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution under the leadership of the Party. This is the case in the heavy and light industrial enterprises we inspected, and it is also the case in the people's communes, large, middle and primary schools, educational units, street work, and everywhere else. As a result of the extensive and in-depth development of the technical revolution movement, Qingdao Integrated Wood Processing Plant has basically changed from manual operation with a billhook, axe, file, and plane to achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization in more than 85% of the entire production process, and is gradually developing towards dragon-like and complete sets of equipment. The quality and variety of products are increasing day by day, thus making the total output value in 1958 and 1959 increase by 2.68 times and 3.1 times respectively compared with the previous year. Recently, the "Xu Chenglong Assault Team" has exceeded the scope of the factory. Wherever technical innovation encounters difficulties in various industries in Qingdao City, this assault team rushes there. How heroic is this communist style! Qingdao Bicycle Factory responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee at the beginning of 1960 by pointing the spearhead of technical innovation at mechanization and semi-mechanization. In January and February, the innovation and construction of the employees reached 2,312 items, and 1,124 items have been realized. In February, the first battle realized an automatic assembly line; seven assembly lines, four single-machine automated machine tools, and 35 manual operations were transformed into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. Among them, the electroplating assembly line can replace the operation of the original 68 people with only two or three people. Manual operations will be basically eliminated in the entire factory within the year. The Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory used to be a repair shop. Now it produces a large number of advanced motors and carding machines. One section of the casting workshop has been mechanized, and the entire factory is advancing towards tenizations. The Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory implements the combination of production, learning, and scientific research with one main and two auxiliary aspects, which strongly promotes technical innovation. In 1959, employees proposed 2,450 innovation projects and realized 431 of them, including 33 major innovation projects. This greatly improved work efficiency and reduced costs. Thirty-eight papers were written in learning and research work, which improved the scientific level of employees. Therefore, the national plan was overfulfilled 57 days ahead of schedule in 1959. From January to March this year, 175 innovation projects have been realized, some of which can mechanize and continuously perform 11 processes; shorten working hours by 37.9%, reduce personnel by 37.5%, and lay the foundation for realizing the upgrading and diversification of products, process mechanization and automation, thereby strongly ensuring the overfulfillment of the annual plan.

Technical innovation is carried out every day and technical revolution is carried out everywhere in various enterprises, people's communes, large, middle and primary schools, research institutions, and streets in Qingdao City! The countless examples reflected in the panel discussions fully show that this is also the case throughout the country. We feel that this is what Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, "The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in our country are launching a magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement with irresistible force. In the movement, new people and new things emerge one after another, innovation and creativity blossom everywhere, and the communist style is further promoted!" This magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement will ensure the realization of our country's leap forward plan for 1960, ensure the continuous acceleration of the development of our country's socialist construction, and also ensure that our country can be built into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture ahead of schedule.

This conference and the reports of the two vice premiers have further inspired our enthusiasm and stimulated our love for the Party and for socialism. We firmly listen to the Party's words and devote ourselves to technical innovation and technical revolution in all aspects of our respective jobs. We resolutely respond to all the Party's calls, and at the same time, we earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, actively serve, and strengthen transformation! As long as there is a breath of life, we will definitely struggle tirelessly for the Party's great socialist and communist cause!

Wish the conference a success and everyone good health!

专栏：

    视察青岛的见闻
    王洵才、刘同诰、张公制、张玺代表朱树屏委员的联合发言
    我们热情拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理向全国人大二届二次会议作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案”的报告和“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案”的报告，这两个报告正确地反映了全国人民在党的领导下积极热情建设社会主义和全面持续跃进的英雄姿态，正确地指出了本年的奋斗目标和工作方针，大大地鼓舞了我们争取1960年更大跃进和更大胜利的信心和干劲。
    在这次大会以前，我们在山东省青岛市视察，青岛第三钢铁厂、纺织机械厂、青岛自行车厂、青岛木材综合加工厂、青岛印染厂、惜福镇人民公社的付家埠生产大队、夏庄人民公社的沙沟大队、仙家寨人民公社的赵村生产队、中朝人民公社的石老人生产队、山东海洋学院、青岛二中、江苏路小学和汉口路街道办事处。在视察中我们到处看到各项事业高速度发展中的令人欢欣鼓舞的事例和跃进更跃进的壮丽景象，处处表现出青岛市各项社会主义建设事业也和全国其它地区一样，1959年又在1958年大跃进的基础上有了一个更全面更好的继续大跃进，在今年的开门红的各个战线上也同样表现出了一个大跃进。这次视察工作对我们说来是上了一堂实际的社会主义教育课，使我们受到极大的鼓舞，并使我们进一步认识到党的一切方针政策的正确性，总路线和大跃进深入人心，人民公社的无比优越性，三大法宝为人民群众掌握后在社会主义建设中产生了伟大的物质力量。
    一、在党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，我国发展钢铁工业已取得了伟大的成就，群众性炼钢运动已遍地开花结果。1958年秋党中央提出以钢为纲全面跃进和全党全民大办钢铁的伟大号召，青岛市全体市民立即投入轰轰烈烈的炼钢运动。我们视察过的青岛第三钢铁厂就是这次大炼钢铁运动的产物。它和青岛市其它钢铁厂一样是从无到有，在一片荒地上平地建炉、白手起家，穷干苦干加巧干，从小到大，从土到洋，边生产边建设地发展起来的，工人都是1958年从农村来的，从不知怎样炼钢铁，在党的培养教育下已经变为炼钢的能手，实现了“炼钢也炼了人”的口号。目前全厂职工意气风发、干劲十足，决心超额完成1960年的任务。青岛自行车厂从1958年土法炼钢开始，现在已有了设备齐全的炼钢车间，每月生产好钢二千多吨，全国知名的零点五小转炉能炼出一级钢保持在95％以上，这个厂生产自行车所需的钢材除了能自给外，还支援辽宁、青海、甘肃、贵州等十个省份的四十七个单位。同时，青岛也和全国其它各地一样，在工业建设中以钢为纲，带动了其它工业的大发展。青岛的情况和小组座谈中各位代表和委员所反映的许多事例也都雄辩地说明了1958年全民炼钢的种子已在全国各地发芽生枝，鲜花怒放，硕果累累。正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的那样，目前全国各省、市、自治区除西藏外都有了钢铁企业，在1958年开始建设起来的小土群，特别是炼铁、炼钢和采煤的企业，经过整顿、提高，生产规模扩大了，技术水平提高了，发展成为洋法生产或者洋土结合的企业，在生产建设事业中发挥愈来愈大的作用。我们视察的青岛三钢和青岛自行车厂就是这方面极现实的例子。我们深信，1958年由“小土群”开始的这些钢铁企业在完成今年的和以后的钢铁生产任务中一定会发挥更大的作用，我们也深信1960年生产一千八百四十万吨好钢的计划指标一定能够完成和超额完成。由此可见，党中央提出的以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针以及两年来行之有效的在优先发展重工业的条件下，工业和农业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举等一整套“同时并举”的方针是英明的、正确的，它能保证国民经济高速度地、按比例地向前发展。
    二、人民公社的确有强大的生命力和无比的优越性，在我们视察四个人民公社的过程中，到处使我们感觉到农村和田野的面貌是正在迅速地改变着，组成惜福镇人民公社付家埠生产大队的两个村庄，和夏庄人民公社的沙沟村，从前是穷山和沟壑，洪水常发，耕田瘠薄，村中居民生活极为艰苦，劳动人民终年得不到一饱，常外出逃荒要饭。解放后在党的领导下逐步改变了山区的贫困面貌，1958年人民公社化后社员干劲冲天，掀起了一个治山治水的高潮，到去年春天已基本上达到了较高标准的水土保持的要求，农林牧副渔得到了全面发展。付家埠生产队已经基本上实现了十化，即：一、山区园林化，二、坡地梯田水平化，三、农田水利化，四、灌溉自流化，五、耕地园田化，六、四旁绿化，七、沟壑谷坊水库化，八、水产多样化，九、山路交通化，十、工程系统化。大大地改变了山区的面貌。社员们赞美说“远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山，山上山下果树连成片，桃红柳绿，百花争艳；昔日穷山恶水的付家埠，现在是富饶美丽的大花园”。1959年每人平均收入为八十五元。居民百分之百的在公共食堂吃饭。有托儿所、幼儿园、产妇院、敬老院的人民生活已有了显著的提高。沙沟生产队的福利事业和用回龙火坑使地瓜多生芽方法更为出色。
    同样赵村生产队，1958年公社成立后，也是跃进再跃进，在另一种环境条件下大干一年已改变了自然的面貌，基本上实现了这个河口平原地区另一个类型的十化：一、水利机井化，二、灌溉机械化、电气化，三、排灌机械管理专业化，四、土地深翻整平化，五、耕作园田化，六、土地划片成方化，七、灌溉渠道系统化，八、道路规格整齐化，九、四旁绿化、美化、香化，十、水产多样化。粮食蔬菜双丰收，社员生活大改善。
    中朝人民公社的石老人生产队，又是另一个类型：以渔为主农为副，公社成立后大增船网工具，今年5月就可争取起网滑车化、后方加工机械化和半机械化。他们并且创造出一套不增船只不增人力使生产力增加一倍的作业方法。
    李富春副总理在报告中正确地再次指出人民公社是加快我国社会主义建设的最好的社会基层组织形式，1959年在全国播种面积30％遭受严重灾害的情况下，我国农业生产继续得到大跃进的发展，证明了人民公社有强大的生命力和无比的优越性。诚然像我们所视察的山区的，平地的和以海上捕捞为主的几个公社生产队，都是在贫困的基础上发展起来的。去年陆上海上都有严重的灾害，但两年来大自然的面貌改变和人民生活的提高仍是这样大这样快！若非既大且公能充分发挥人民的积极性和创造性的有强大生命力和无比优越性的人民公社，简直是不可想像的。
    现在，正和李副总理在报告中说的那样，全国城市人民正在热情积极地大办人民公社，大办街道工业、郊区农业、公共食堂及各项福利服务事业，进一步组织居民的经济及文化生活和改造城市的社会面貌，这实在是令人欢欣鼓舞的大事、好事！毫无疑问，城市人民公社运动这个新的巨大发展，将对实现两位副总理的报告中所提的1960年的继续跃进的宏伟计划和以后的持续跃进起重要的积极作用。我们除了自己及家属热情积极地参加城市人民公社外，还要动员我们所联系的人士踊跃参加。把城市的经济和它的居民生活依社会发展的需要进一步组织起来，进一步集体化，就可彻底改变旧城市的组织面貌，就可使生产关系更加适合生产力的发展。使工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等部门更能有效地支援农业技术改造。同时这对加速资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子的改造，对根本改变城市人民的精神面貌，也必有积极的意义和极为有利的重要的影响。
    三、教育为无产阶级政治服务，与生产劳动相结合，大大地提高了教学质量和教师的业务及思想水平。
    青岛各高等院校、中校及小学为了保证贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针，除依青岛市工作需要由市统一分配到工农业方面进行生产劳动外，都大办工厂作为师生的生产劳动基地，以青岛二中为例，在我们视察时已有十个工厂十六个车间实际进行生产，产品二十多种质量都相当高，新建的有木粉胶化板、人造大理石、电镀等六个车间，已基本达到劳动基地化，并逐步使生产正常化、管理制度化、操作机械化。目前正以机械厂为纲，以海带场、坩埚厂、电镀厂为重点带动其他各厂的发展和提高。并在“七一”以前要逐步作到机械化和半机械化。在劳动的过程中学生和生产劳动有关的一些基础课程如数学、物理学、化学和生物学等，学习成绩都大为提高和巩固，教师因为对在生产劳动中不断发生的问题必须与学生一起钻研解决，钻研能力及业务水平都在短期内有显著的提高，同时许多具体事例证明生产劳动的实践确实使教师和学生都加速地提高了社会主义觉悟和对社会主义建设的热情。
    山东海洋学院海洋系学生全级全班参加了一年的全国海洋综合调查，他们一方面协助了国家海洋综合调查任务的完成，一方面也在工作中真正学会了并熟练地掌握了海洋调查各个环节的知识和技术。同时因克服了怕海浪和晕船的困难而热爱海洋，加强了征服利用海洋和献身于祖国伟大的海洋事业的决心。参加调查时期的集体的组织纪律生活，对他们也确实是一课共产主义教育。回校后对课堂教学内容的理解程度有了显著的提高，生活作风都有了显著的进步。
    此次大学、中学和小学教育的视察使我们进一步体会到党的教育方针的正确性、教育与生产劳动相结合不但在课业方面提高了教学质量，在劳动中锻炼了体格；在集体生活方面，在发挥创造性、革命性以及其他许多共产主义品质的培养方面都是很有效的一种方式。李富春副总理在报告中正确地指出“在发展教育事业中，必须继续加强党的领导，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。”我们认为这是完全正确的。
    四、为了加速社会主义建设事业的发展和保证完成或超额完成今年的建设计划，必须全国全民大闹技术革新和技术革命。青岛市也和全国各地一样，广大职工群众已在党的领导下积极投入到轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的全民运动中。我们所视察的重工业、轻工业企业是这样，人民公社大中小学教育单位、街道工作也是这样，到处都是这样。青岛木材综合加工厂广泛深入地开展了技术革命运动的结果，从基本上是一锛、一斧、一锉、一刨的手工操作改变为全部生产过程的85％以上达到了机械化、半机械化，并逐步向成龙、成套发展，产品质量及品种日益增加，因而使1958及1959年的总产值各比前一年增加二点六八倍及三点一倍。近来“徐呈龙突击队”已经超过了本厂的范围，青岛市各行各业哪里技术革新遇到了困难，这个突击队就奔向哪里。这种共产主义的风格是多么豪壮！青岛自行车厂1960年开门红即响应市委的号召把技术革新矛头指向机械化和半机械化。1、2月份职工的革新建设即达二千三百一十二件，并已实现了一千一百二十四件。2月份第一个战役即实现了一件自动流水作业线；七件流水作业线，四条单机自动化机床，三十五项手工操作变为机械化半机械化。其中电镀流水作业线，用两三人即可代替原六十八人的操作。年内要基本消灭全厂的手工操作。青岛纺织机械厂过去是一个修配厂、现在大量生产高级马达和梳棉机，铸造车间的一个工段已经机械化，全厂正向十化进军。青岛印染厂实行了生产、学习、科学研究的一主二副三结合，有力地推动了技术革新。1959年职工提出革新项目二千四百五十件，实现了四百三十一件，其中有重大革新项目三十三件。大大地提高了工作效率，降低了成本，在学习及研究工作中写出论文三十八篇，提高了职工的科学水平。因此1959年提前五十七天超额完成了国家计划。今年1至3月内又实现了革新项目一百七十五件，其中有的革新项目可使十一道工序达到机械化、连续化；缩短工时37.9％，减少人员37.5％，并为实现产品高级化、多样化，工艺机械化和自动化打下了基础，从而有力地保证了全年计划的超额完成。
    青岛市各个企业里、人民公社里、大中学校里、研究机构里、街道里，无不天天搞技术革新，处处搞技术革命！在小组讨论中反映的无穷事例，充分表明全国各地也是如此，我们觉得这就是李富春副总理在报告中说的“我国广大的工人、农民和知识分子，正在以破竹之势，开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。在运动中，新人新事层出不穷，革新创举到处开花，共产主义风格更加发扬”！这个波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，将保证我国1960年跃进计划的实现，保证我国社会主义建设事业的发展的持续加速，也保证能提前把我国建设成一个拥有现代工业现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。
    这次大会和两位副总理的报告进一步鼓舞了我们的干劲，激发了我们对党和对社会主义的热爱，我们坚决的听党的话，在各自的工作岗位上从各个方面致力于技术革新和技术革命，坚决响应党的一切号召，同时认真学习毛泽东思想，积极服务加强改造！一息犹存，必为党的伟大的社会主义共产主义事业奋斗不懈！
    祝大会成功，各位身体健康！（附图片）
