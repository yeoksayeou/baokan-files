Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 25th - Premier Zhou Enlai held a press conference at the Indian Presidential Palace tonight. He answered questions raised by Indian reporters and other foreign journalists.

Present at the press conference were Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 25th - Premier Zhou Enlai issued a written statement at a press conference held in Delhi tonight. The full text is as follows:

At the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru, I paid a friendly visit to India from April 19th to 25th, 1960. I am glad to have this opportunity to visit the great Republic of India again and to extend my greetings to the great Indian people. During the visit, we received a warm welcome and hospitality from the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru, for which Vice Premier Chen Yi and my other colleagues and I express our heartfelt thanks.

The Chinese and Indian peoples are two great nations in Asia. Since ancient times, the peoples of our two countries have been mutually friendly and sympathetic, and have never been hostile or aggressive towards each other. Since our two countries successively achieved independence, especially since we jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the profound friendship between the peoples of our two countries has been further developed on a new basis. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between our two countries. Our two countries have every reason to be friendly for ten thousand years. In the past year or two, although disputes have arisen between the two countries over the boundary issue left over by history, the peoples of our two countries have always maintained their desire for mutual friendship. We believe that the boundary issue between our two countries can be resolved fairly and reasonably through peaceful consultation. It is with this belief that we have come.

During the visit, I had several long discussions with Prime Minister Nehru on issues of common concern, especially the Sino-Indian boundary issue. Both sides clarified their respective positions and views on the boundary issue and their proposals for resolving it. I believe that this discussion helps to increase mutual understanding. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu and I also met separately with several cabinet ministers of the Indian government for frank discussions. After seven days of talks, although we were unable to reach an agreement on resolving the boundary issue as we had hoped, both sides agreed that officials from both sides should meet to review, verify, and study the factual materials related to the boundary issue and submit a report to the two governments. Both sides also agreed that, during the meeting of officials from the two countries, every effort should be made to avoid friction and conflict in the border areas. These agreements have been included in the joint communique of the two prime ministers. We believe that these agreements are of positive significance for maintaining peace and tranquility on the border and for continuing to seek a reasonable solution to the boundary issue.

After a frank exchange of views between the two prime ministers, I found that we not only have a common desire to maintain friendly relations between the two countries, but also that it is not impossible to find common ground or points of convergence on the boundary issue. I think it can be roughly summarized as the following six points:

    One, there are disputes on the border between the two sides.
    Two, there is a line of actual control between the two countries, within the scope of their own administrative jurisdiction.
    Three, when determining the boundary between the two countries, certain geographical principles, such as watersheds, valleys, and passes, should apply equally to all sections of the boundary.
    Four, the resolution of the boundary issue between the two countries should take into account the national sentiments of the people of both countries towards the Himalayas and the Karakoram Mountains.
    Five, before the boundary issue between the two countries is resolved through negotiation, both sides should abide by the line of actual control and not propose territorial claims as a prerequisite, but individual adjustments can be made.
    Six, in order to ensure border tranquility and facilitate the progress of negotiations, both sides should continue to cease patrols in all sections of the border.

Of course, the Indian government still has a distance from us on the above six points. However, I believe that as long as both parties continue to negotiate, this distance is not difficult to narrow and eliminate. Once these common points are found, it will undoubtedly greatly advance both sides towards a reasonable solution to the Sino-Indian boundary issue.

The Chinese government has consistently maintained that, since the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, the Chinese and Indian sides should consider the historical background and the current reality, and, in accordance with the Five Principles jointly advocated by the two countries, adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, and seek a reasonable solution to the boundary issue between the two countries through peaceful and friendly consultation. Before this, both sides should maintain the status quo of the border, and not change this situation by unilateral actions, and even less allow the use of force. For some disputes, temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations. The Chinese government believes that Sino-Indian friendship is of extremely great significance to the ten hundred million people of the two countries and to Asian and world peace. This friendship should not and cannot be damaged by the temporary failure to resolve the Sino-Indian boundary issue.

Tomorrow, we will bid farewell to the national leaders and the great people of India. On the eve of this farewell, I would like to once again state that the Chinese government has an unshakable confidence in resolving the Sino-Indian boundary issue and strengthening the friendship between the two countries, and will make unremitting efforts for this purpose. In order to give the prime ministers of the two countries an opportunity to meet again, to promote friendly relations between the two countries and to thank Prime Minister Nehru for his hospitality, I have invited Prime Minister Nehru to visit China at his convenience.

    周总理向记者发表书面讲话
    中印两国有一切理由应该千年万年地友好下去
    边界问题并不是不可以找到共同点或接近之点
    新华社新德里25日电　周恩来总理今天晚上在印度总统府举行记者招待会。他回答了印度记者和其他外国记者提出的问题。
    出席记者招待会的有中国副总理兼外交部长陈毅、外交部副部长章汉夫和中国驻印度大使潘自力。
    新华社新德里25日电　周恩来总理今天晚上在德里举行的记者招待会上发表书面讲话，全文如下：
    我应尼赫鲁总理的邀请于1960年4月19日至25日在印度进行了友好访问，我感到高兴能有此机会再次访问伟大的印度共和国，并且向伟大的印度人民致意。在访问期间我们受到了印度政府和尼赫鲁总理盛情的欢迎和款待，对此我和陈毅副总理以及其他的同事们表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民和印度人民是亚洲的两个伟大民族。从遥远的年代起，我们两国人民一直是互相友好、互相同情，从来没有互相敌对和互相侵犯。在我们两国先后取得独立以后，特别是自从我们共同倡导和平共处五项原则以来，两国人民的深厚友谊又在新的基础上得到进一步的发展。我们两国之间没有基本的利害冲突。我们两国有一切理由应该千年万年地友好下去。最近一两年来，两国之间虽然在历史遗留下来的边界问题上发生了争议，但是我们两国人民始终保持互相友好的愿望。我们相信，两国之间的边界问题完全可以经过和平协商得到公平合理的解决。我们正是抱着这样的信念而来的。
    在访问期间，我同尼赫鲁总理就共同关心的问题，特别是中印边界问题，作了多次的长时间的讨论。我们双方阐明了各自对边界问题的立场、观点和对解决这个问题的主张。我认为这种讨论有助于增进彼此的了解。我和陈毅副总理、章汉夫副部长还同印度政府的几位内阁部长分别会晤，进行了坦率的讨论。经过七天的会谈，虽然没有能够如我们所期望的达成解决边界问题的协议，但是双方一致同意，由双方官员会晤，审查、核对和研究有关边界问题的事实材料，向两国政府提出报告。双方还同意，在两国官员会晤期间，应该尽一切努力在边境地区避免摩擦和冲突。这些协议已见于两国总理的联合公报。我们认为，这些协议对于维持边界的安宁和继续寻找合理解决边界问题的途径是具有积极意义的。
    经过两国总理坦率地交换意见，我发现我们双方不仅具有保持两国友好关系的共同愿望，而且在边界问题上也并不是不可以找到共同点或者接近之点的。我认为，可以大致归纳为以下六点：
    一、双方边界存在着争议。
    二、在两国之间存在着一条各自行政管辖所及的实际控制线。
    三、在确定两国边界时，某些地理原则，如分水岭、水谷、山口等应该同样适用于边界各段。
    四、两国边界问题的解决应该照顾到两国人民对喜马拉雅山和喀喇昆仑山的民族感情。
    五、在两国边界问题经过商谈得到解决之前，双方应该各守实际控制线，不提出领土要求作为先决条件，但可进行个别调整。
  六、为了保证边界安宁、便于商谈的进行，双方在边界各段应该继续停止巡逻。
    当然，对以上六点，印度政府现在还和我们有距离。但是，我认为，只要双方继续协商，这种距离是不难缩小和消除的。一旦找到了这些共同点，无疑将使双方向中印边界问题的合理解决大大地跨进一步。
    中国政府一贯主张，由于中印边界从未正式划定，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据两国共同倡导的五项原则，采取互谅互让的态度，通过和平友好的协商，来求得两国边界问题的合理解决。在此以前，双方应该维持边界的现状，不以片面行动，更不允许使用武力，来改变这种状况。对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判，达成临时性的协议。中国政府认为，中印友谊对于两国十亿人民和亚洲和世界和平均有极其重大的意义。这种友谊不应该、也不可能由于中印边界问题暂时未能解决而受到损害。
    明天，我们就要向印度的国家领导人和伟大的印度人民告别。在这离别的前夕，我愿意再一次表明，中国政府对于解决中印边界问题和加强两国的友谊具有不可动摇的信心，并且将为此进行不懈的努力。为了使两国总理有机会再一次会谈，为了促进两国的友好关系和答谢尼赫鲁总理的盛情款待，我已经邀请尼赫鲁总理在他方便的时候到中国访问。
