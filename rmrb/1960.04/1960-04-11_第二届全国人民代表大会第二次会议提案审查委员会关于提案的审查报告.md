Report on the Examination of Proposals by the Proposal Examination Committee of the Second National People's Congress, Second Session
          Chairman of the Proposal Examination Committee of the Second National People's Congress, Second Session: Zhang Youyu
    The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress received a total of 46 proposals. Among them, 22 concerned industry and transportation, 9 concerned agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, 2 concerned finance and trade, and 13 concerned culture, education, health, and science and technology.

    The Proposal Examination Committee established five specialized examination groups for industry, agriculture, finance and trade, culture and education, and general affairs. All proposals were first studied by the relevant specialized examination groups, which put forward preliminary examination opinions, and then passed by the committee case by case.

    Some of the proposals from this session are being processed or have been included in the national plan for implementation; some should be implemented and are likely to be implemented; some involve many aspects and require overall consideration or need active creation of conditions for gradual implementation; some require comprehensive investigation and in-depth understanding before it can be determined whether they can be implemented; some have research value in science and technology. The Proposal Examination Committee has drafted examination opinions according to these situations.

    The Proposal Examination Committee believes that the proposals from this session will play a positive role in the continued leap forward of China's socialist construction and the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Therefore, it is recommended that the proposals from this session be handed over to the State Council for handling in accordance with the examination opinions, and that a report on the handling be submitted.

    The "Proposals of the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress and Draft Examination Opinions on the Proposals" passed by the Proposal Examination Committee are now submitted to the Congress for deliberation.

    第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案审查委员会关于提案的审查报告
          第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案审查委员会主任委员　张友渔
    第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议共收到提案四十六件。其中属于工业交通方面的二十二件，农林水利方面的九件，财政贸易方面的二件，文教卫生和科学技术方面的十三件。
    提案审查委员会设立了工业、农业、财贸、文教、综合五个专业审查组。所有提案，都先由有关的专业审查组进行研究，提出初步审查意见，然后经委员会逐案通过。
    这次会议的提案，有些是正在办理或者已经列入国家计划准备办理的；有些是应当办理而又可能办理的；有些是牵涉方面较多，需要通盘考虑或者需要积极创造条件逐步实施的；有些是需要经过全面调查和深入了解之后才能肯定能否办理的；有些是在科学技术上有研究价值的。提案审查委员会按照这些情况，分别拟具了审查意见。
    提案审查委员会认为：这次会议的提案，对于我国社会主义建设事业的继续跃进和技术革新、技术革命运动的深入开展，将起到积极的作用。为此建议：把这次会议的提案交由国务院依照审查意见进行处理，并将处理情况提出报告。
    现在把提案审查委员会通过的“第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案和提案审查意见（草案）”提请大会审议。
