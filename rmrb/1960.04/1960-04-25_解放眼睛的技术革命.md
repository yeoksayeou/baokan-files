    The Technical Revolution to Liberate Eyes

    In the past, people always felt that it would be difficult to find other ways to repair watches without manual labor. However, the employees of the clock and watch department of the Chengguan Catering Service General Store in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, recently successfully manufactured sixteen kinds of watch repair machines and tools, enabling mechanical operation for manual operations such as cleaning watches, winding, adjusting hairsprings, grinding balance pivots, matching hairsprings, filing, drilling, and winding watches. This not only greatly reduced labor but also improved the quality of repairs, with the return rate dropping from 30 percent to 5 percent.

    解放眼睛的技术革命
    在过去，人们总觉得离开手工劳动是很难找出别的办法来修表的。可是，山西介休县城关饮食服务总店钟表门市部的职工们，最近自制成功了十六种修表机械和工具，使洗表，上条、调整游丝、磨摆尖、配游丝、铡锉、钻眼、上表等等手工操作都实现了机械操作。这样，不仅大大减轻了劳动，还提高了修理质量，回修率由过去的百分之三十降低到百分之五。
