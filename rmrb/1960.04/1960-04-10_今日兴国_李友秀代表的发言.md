Today's Xingguo

Speech by Representative Li Youxiu

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I will resolutely implement them in my future work. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the people of Xingguo have continuously received the cordial care and support of the leaders in socialist construction, which has brought about great changes in Xingguo. The people of the entire county, holding high the victorious red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have overfulfilled the 1959 national economic plan with soaring enthusiasm, and have achieved a good start and an all-round red achievement in 1960.

In 1959, despite overcoming floods, droughts, hail, insects, and other disasters unprecedented in decades, the total agricultural output value of our county still reached 32 million yuan, an increase of 14% compared to 1958; the total grain output reached 276 million jin, an increase of 13% compared to 1958; and economic crops also saw greater development than in 1958. The winter planting area reached 400,186 mu, an increase of 38% compared to 1958. The preparatory work for agricultural production this year has been done earlier and better than in any previous year, with more fertilizer. Fields that could not grow green manure were plowed two or three times last winter and were applied with base fertilizer. Therefore, the masses say: Last winter, we finished the work that we used to do during the rice transplanting season.

While agricultural production was leaping forward, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also achieved an all-round leap forward. In 1959, more than 60,000 mu of afforestation were completed, an increase of more than 300% compared to 1958. Forty-five thousand five hundred mu of oil-tea hills were reclaimed, an increase of 74.6% compared to 1958. One million five hundred thousand seedlings of various fruit trees were cultivated. The production of livestock and poultry, centered on pig raising, has developed to more than 260,000 pigs by now, an increase of 62% compared to 1958, due to the implementation of the principle of "collective raising as the main focus, with public and private efforts combined." Fishery production reached 8,043 dan, an increase of 116% compared to 1958; more than 60 million red carp fry were hatched, which not only met the needs of stocking in the county but also supplied Beijing and Lushan. Sideline production income reached 12.29 million yuan, an average of 39.4 yuan per person, an increase of 41.6% compared to 1958. In terms of water conservancy facilities, 1,668 new large and small water conservancy projects were built last winter and this spring; 29,897 large and small water conservancy projects were repaired, increasing the irrigated area by 58,915 mu and improving the irrigated area by 42,620 mu. In particular, the Changlong Reservoir, with a dam length of 105 meters, a dam height of 41 meters, a main canal of more than 100 li, branch canals of more than 200 li, 310 auxiliary structures, and 2.65 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, such a arduous and magnificent project, has been completed and is benefiting the area, and will generate more than 1,000 kilowatts of electricity. The great achievements in water conservancy construction not only overcame the particularly severe floods and droughts of last year and ensured a bumper harvest of crops throughout the year, but also laid the foundation for realizing self-flowing irrigation this year.

In the industrial field, a high tide of people's communes running industries was set off in the spring of 1959. Two thousand and fifty-six new factories and mines were built, and 537 factories and mines were expanded. These factories and mines have been continuously developed, consolidated, and improved after rectification. Up to now, there are 22 county-run factories and mines, 164 commune-run factories and mines, and 2,471 team-run factories and mines in the county. The county has a total of 6,647 employees (excluding the number of people who are both workers and farmers in the teams), an increase of 2.68 times compared to 1958. These factories and mines, due to the implementation of the policy of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and serving agricultural production and people's lives, completed the industrial output value plan of 15.32 million yuan 51 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 44.85% compared to 1958. In terms of major products, 18,772 tons of coal were completed, an increase of 85.36% compared to 1958, and 425 tons of indigenous steel were completed, an increase of 88.44% compared to 1958. The machinery industry has also made certain progress. The processing of agricultural and sideline products has increased several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times in terms of both variety and quantity compared to last year.

In terms of transportation, the policy of the entire people running transportation and the spirit of self-reliance were implemented. The Longgang Commune built a large stone bridge 100 meters long and 4.8 meters wide, capable of carrying 5-ton trucks, without any technical force. The Changgang Commune built the 145-meter-long Changgang Bridge. In the past year, 251 kilometers of new roads have been built. The county has a total of 406 kilometers of roads open to traffic, realizing road access to every commune. For short-distance transportation, 3,806 handcarts, 306 large and small flatbed carts, 182 animal-drawn carts, 184 bamboo rafts, and 39 wooden boats have been developed, thus forming a land and water transportation network combining indigenous and modern methods.

In terms of basic construction, the total area of various basic construction projects reached 42,600 square meters, an increase of 33% compared to 1958, with a total investment of more than 3.5 million yuan, an increase of 73% compared to 1958. Now the appearance of urban and rural areas has undergone great changes, presenting a new and inspiring atmosphere everywhere.

Financial and trade work has implemented the principle of "everything for production, everything for the masses, and being a good logistics department," realizing a full house of red in the 1959 financial and trade work 45 days ahead of schedule. Due to the over-fulfillment of financial and trade work tasks, a solid material foundation has been laid for market supply. A prosperous scene of "poultry filling the market, vegetables filling the streets, pastries and fruits available for selection, local products and mountain goods of all kinds, and agricultural and sideline products everywhere" has appeared in the market. Therefore, we won the first red flag in financial and trade work in the Gannan area.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's material and cultural living standards have been greatly improved. In 1959, the per capita social purchasing power reached 60 yuan, an increase of 30% compared to 1958. Universal primary and secondary education was popularized throughout the county, and 86.8% of illiteracy was eliminated.

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the people of our county have given play to the communist spirit of "four dares" on all fronts, and have set off a high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution, with various inventions emerging in droves. In the past year, 679 items and 28,567 pieces have been invented in industry, transportation, agriculture, forestry, medicine, and health, 3,558 items and 25,840 pieces have been modified, and 3,514 items and 11,700 pieces have been imitated. At the same time, a technical team serving industry and agriculture has also been trained in practice. Factory and handicraft workers have created more than 100 kinds of new tools, such as peanut shellers, rice milling machines, green manure seeders, feed choppers, feed grinders, and hydraulic presses, according to the needs of agricultural production. Foreign-style lathes, threshing machines, rapid harvesters, indigenous trains, and ox-drawn carts have been imitated and modified, greatly improving work efficiency. For example, the installation of more than 90 automated hydraulic rice milling machines and more than 260 hydraulic hullers and mortars to realize the automation of grain processing has saved more than 400,000 labor days in one year alone, strongly supporting agricultural production. In particular, the Mechanical Factory and the Commercial Bureau Experimental Factory and other units have made more than 70 kinds of new products such as hammers, twist drills, and files from indigenous steel and indigenous iron, which not only meet the needs of local production and construction, but also are sold to other places, and many products are also sent abroad for exhibition.

In 1960, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our county is planned to reach 57 million yuan, an increase of 40% compared to 1959. Our slogans are: thoroughly oppose right-leaning and encourage vigor, achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu; achieve one pig per mu, 20 jin of oil per person; an income of 800 yuan per household, and 1,000 jin of grain per person. Our measures and determination are:

1. Adhere to putting politics in command, hold even higher the red flag of the General Line, and continue to carry out in depth the socialist education movement with opposing right-leaning and encouraging vigor as the guideline and production and construction as the center, use the spirit of the General Line and the current excellent situation to educate the vast number of cadres and the masses, thoroughly break the "theory that production has reached its peak," the "theory of sole reliance on conditions," and the idea of "being content with being in the middle," and constantly criticize and overcome various forms of right-leaning thinking, establish the spirit of continuous revolution, strive for the upper reaches, and ensure the special leap forward in all aspects of production this year.

2. Vigorously launch mass movements and adhere to red flag competitions. In future production movements, continue to give full play to the combination of large-scale operations and small-scale activities, carry out large-scale assaults, large-scale cooperation, large-scale inspections, large-scale evaluations, large-scale competitions, as well as grasp the two ends and lead the middle, establish pace-setters, strive to be models, and hold on-site conferences to continuously set off a new high tide of socialist competition in learning, comparing, catching up, and helping.

3. Comprehensively carry out mass movements of technological innovation and technological revolution, accelerate the realization of "three transformations" in agriculture, and achieve that everyone engages in technological innovation, everything has technological innovation, and everywhere has technological innovation. And vigorously carry out tool reforms, vigorously promote nine machines (threshing machine, rice transplanter, seeder, weeding machine, feed chopper, harvester, sweet potato digger, hydraulic rice milling machine, animal-powered water pump); realize eight transformations: basic self-flowing irrigation, electrification of market towns, semi-mechanization of agricultural production combining indigenous and modern methods, semi-mechanization of cooking tools, automation of hydraulic rice milling, semi-mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing, motorization of transportation, and greening of bare mountains and bald ridges. The machinery industry must accelerate its development. In addition to the county machinery factory adding 22 lathes, each commune must have simple lathes, and each team must have five tools (hammer, pliers, saw, drill, file). In transportation construction, realize one network and four transformations, namely, a land and water transportation network, motorization, boating, semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, and cableway and chute transformation. And resolutely complete the construction of 500 kilometers of highways, 1,200 kilometers of rural roads, repair 25 kilometers of river channels, and develop 36,000 various vehicles, achieving vehicle access to every team.

4. Resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture centered on water and fertilizer, reasonable close planting adapted to local conditions; vigorously develop indigenous pesticides to eliminate pests and diseases; and frequently and actively carry out manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaigns. In addition to applying the first base fertilizer (cattle and pig manure) to all paddy fields that could not grow green manure last year, the county is currently further opening up fertilizer sources and carrying out a concentrated fertilizer production campaign. In areas with severe soil erosion, organize labor armies to accumulate fertilizer on mountains thirty or forty li away. In order to ensure the people's meat and fertilizer needs, we must also vigorously develop pig raising. Now the county has established 1,517 pig farms, ensuring one pig per person this year, and strive to achieve one pig per mu ahead of schedule.

We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the State Council, and the higher-level Party and government, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and inspired by the high-speed development of socialism, the people of Xingguo have full confidence and determination to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan in 1960.

    今日兴国
    李友秀代表的发言主席、各位代表：
　  我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告，并在今后实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。兴国人民在党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，在社会主义建设中，不断地得到首长们的亲切关怀和支持，使兴国的面貌有了很大的变化。全县人民高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利红旗，以冲天的干劲，超额完成了1959年国民经济计划，并实现了1960年的开门红、全面红。　  我县1959年的农业生产，在战胜了数十年来从未有过的水、旱、雹、虫等灾害的情况下，农业总产值仍达到了三千二百万元，比1958年增长了14％；粮食总产量达到了二亿七千六百万斤，比1958年增长13％；经济作物也比1958年有了更大的发展；冬种作物面积达四十万零一千八百零六亩，比1958年增加了38％。今年农业生产的准备工作，比过去任何一年都做得更早、更好，肥料更多。不能种绿肥的田在去年冬天都犁了二、三次，并下了基肥。因此群众说：去年冬天就做完了往年莳田的工夫。
      在农业生产大跃进的同时，林业、牧业、副业、渔业也获得了全面的跃进。1959年造林六万多亩。比1958年增加了百分之三百多。垦复油茶山四万五千五百亩，比1958年增加了74.6％。培育各种果树苗木一百五十万株。以养猪为中心的家畜、家禽生产，由于贯彻执行了“公养为主，公私并举”的方针，到目前止，生猪已发展到二十六万多头，比1958年增长了62％。渔业生产达到了八千零四十三担，比1958年增产116％；孵化红鲤鱼苗六千多万尾，不仅满足了本县放养的需要，并且还供应了北京、庐山。副业生产收入达到了一千二百二十九万元，每人平均三十九点四元，比1958年增长41.6％。在水利设施上，去冬今春新建大、小水利工程计一千六百六十八处；修建大、小水利工程二万九千八百九十七处，增加灌溉面积五万八千九百一十五亩，改善灌溉面积四万二千六百二十亩，特别是修建了坝长达一百零五米、坝高四十一米、干渠一百多华里、支渠二百多华里，附属建筑物三百一十处，土石方达二百六十五万公方的长龙水库，这样艰巨而宏伟的工程，已经竣工受益，并将要发电一千余瓩。水利建设上的伟大成就，不仅战胜了去年特大的水、旱灾害，保证了全年农作物丰收，而且给今年实现灌溉自流化，打下了基础。
    在工业方面，在1959年春季掀起了人民公社大办工业的高潮。新建厂矿二千零五十六个，扩建厂矿五百三十七个。这些厂矿经过整顿，得到了不断的发展巩固和提高。到目前为止，全县共有县办厂矿二十二个，社办厂矿一百六十四个，队办厂矿二千四百七十一个。全县共有职工六千六百四十七名（不包括队办亦工亦农的人数）较1958年增加二点六八倍。这些厂矿由于贯彻执行了因地制宜，就地取材，为农业生产和人民生活服务的方针，提前五十一天完成了一千五百三十二万元工业产值计划，比1958年增长44.85％。在主要产品方面，煤完成一万八千七百七十二吨，比1958年增加了85.36％，土钢完成四百二十五吨，比1958年增长88.44％。机械工业也有了一定的发展。农副产品加工，不论是在品种和数量上都比去年增长几倍、几十倍、甚至几百倍。
    在交通运输方面，贯彻执行了全民办交通的方针和自力更生的精神，龙岗公社在没有技术力量的情况下，自建了一座四点八米宽一百米长的大石桥，可过五吨的载重汽车。长岗公社建起了一座一百四十五米长的长岗大桥。一年来新建公路二百五十一公里。全县已通车公路共计四百零六公里，实现了社社通公路。短途运输，发展手推车三千八百零六辆，大、小板车三百零六辆，畜力车一百八十二辆，竹筏一百八十四条，木船三十九艘，这样就构成了一个土洋并举的水陆交通运输网。
    在基本建设方面，各种基建面积总共达到了四万二千六百平方米，比1958年扩大了33％，总投资达三百五十余万元，比1958年增长了73％。现在城乡面貌有很大的改变，处处呈现着令人振奋的新气象。
    财贸工作，贯彻执行了“一切为生产、一切为群众、当好后勤部”的原则，提前四十五天实现了1959年财贸工作满堂红。由于财贸工作任务的超额完成，为市场供应打下了雄厚的物质基础，市场上出现了“家禽满市菜满街，糕点水果任选买，土产山货样样有，农副产品处处摆”的繁荣景象。因此，获得了赣南区财贸工作第一的红旗。
    随着工、农业生产的发展，人民物质文化生活水平得到了很大的提高，1959年社会购买力每人平均达到六十元，比1958年增长了30％。全县普及了中、小学教育，扫除了86.8％的文盲。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我县人民在各个战线上，发挥了共产主义的“四敢”精神，掀起了技术革新技术革命的高潮，各种创造发明风起云涌。一年来在工交、农林、医药卫生等方面，创造发明了六百七十九项，二万八千五百六十七件，改制了三千五百五十八项，二万五千八百四十件，仿制三千五百一十四项，一万一千七百件。同时在实践中，还培养了一支为工农业服务的技术队伍。工厂和手工业工人根据农业生产的需要，创造了花生剥壳机、碾米机、绿肥播种机、食料切碎机、饲料粉碎机、水力打榨等一百余种新工具。仿制与改制了洋车床、打谷机、快速收割器、土火车、牛拉车等，大大地提高了工效。如安装九十多部自动化水力碾米机和二百六十多处水砻水碓，实现粮食加工自动化，仅这一项改革一年可节省劳动日四十多万个，有力的支援了农业生产。特别是机械厂和商业局试验厂等单位，用土钢土铁制成的鎯头、麻花钻、锉刀等七十多种新产品，不仅供应了本县生产建设的需要，而且还运销外地，不少产品还送出国外展览。
    1960年，我县工农业总产值计划，要达到五千七百万元，比1959年增长40％，我们的口号是：反透右倾鼓干劲，粮食亩产达千斤；实现亩田一头猪，每人油脂二十斤；每户收入八百元，每人有粮一千斤。我们的措施和决心是：
    1、坚持政治挂帅，更高地举起总路线的红旗，继续深入开展以反右倾、鼓干劲为纲、以生产建设为中心的社会主义教育运动，以总路线的精神和当前的大好形势，教育广大干部和群众，大破“增产到顶论”，“唯条件论”和“甘居中游”思想，不断地批判与克服各种形形色色的右倾思想，树立不断革命精神，力争上游，保证实现今年各项生产的特大跃进。
    2、大搞群众运动，坚持红旗竞赛。在今后各项生产运动中，继续充分运用大兵团作战和小部队活动相结合的方法，开展大突击、大协作、大检查、大评比、大竞赛以及抓两头带中间，树标兵，争模范，现场会议等办法，不断地掀起学、比、赶、帮的社会主义大竞赛的新高潮。
    3、全面开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，加速实现农业“三化”，做到人人搞技术革新，样样有技术革新，处处有技术革新。并且大搞工具改革、大力推广九机（打谷机、插秧机、播种机、锄草机、食料切碎机、收割机、刨薯机、水力碾米机、畜力抽水机）；实现八化：水利灌溉基本自流化、圩镇电气化、农业生产土洋并举的半机械化、炊事工具半机械化、水力碾米自动化、农副产品加工半机械化、运输车子化、光山秃岭绿化化。机械工业要加快发展，除县机械厂增加车床二十二台外，每个公社要有简易车床，队要有五具（锤、钳、锯、钻、锉）。在交通建设上，实现一网四化，即水陆交通运输网、车子化、船筏化、装卸半机械化、索道溜槽化。并要坚决完成修建公路五百公里，乡村大道一千二百公里，修整河道二十五公里，发展各种车辆三万六千部，达到队队通车。
    4、坚决贯彻以水肥为中心的农业“八字宪法”，因地制宜的合理密植；大搞土农药，消灭病虫害；经常地积极地开展积肥造肥运动，全县除去年不能种绿肥的水田都下足了第一次基肥（牛猪栏粪）外，目前在进一步开辟肥源，突击造肥。对水土流失严重地方，组织劳动大军到三、四十里远的山上积造肥料。为了保证人民肉食和肥料的需要，我们还要大力发展养猪事业，现在全县已建立了一千五百一十七个养猪场，保证做到今年每人一头猪，并为提前实现亩田一头猪而奋斗。
    我们坚信，在党中央、毛主席和国务院以及上级党、政的正确领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，在社会主义高速度发展的鼓舞下，兴国人民完全有信心有决心，实现1960年更大、更好、更全面的跃进计划。
