Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I sincerely support them and guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work.

Now, I will briefly report on the changes that have taken place in Shanxi Agricultural College after implementing the three-way combination education policy.

Under the direct leadership of the college party committee, Shanxi Agricultural College resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's three-way combination education policy. All teachers and students were sent to five base points throughout the province, where they lived, ate, and worked alongside the peasants for a year. While engaging in labor production, they adopted a method of combining teaching, scientific research, and labor production. They completed the teaching plans for the main courses of each grade, combined with teaching, combined with problems existing in production, and teachers and students combined with local people to widely carry out scientific research. They conducted 279 scientific research projects, 234 investigations, compiled 61 types of teaching materials, and wrote 771 special papers in the various communes where they were stationed.

After being tempered by being sent to the countryside, participating in the Great Leap Forward for Steel and deep plowing campaigns, the face of Shanxi Agricultural College has undergone fundamental changes. The main manifestations are:

The labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint have been firmly established among the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff. Teacher-student relations have improved, forming a new, democratic teacher-student relationship of "teaching each other."

The content of the curriculum has been combined with reality and production, and the quality of teaching has been greatly improved.

Scientific research has initially formed a mass movement, carried out simultaneously both on and off campus, and has achieved remarkable results.

Farm production has increased unprecedentedly. In 1959, the average wheat yield was 500 jin and 7 liang per mu, and the corn yield was over 1,000 jin per mu. The work of the administrative departments has also improved significantly, work efficiency has greatly improved, and the sense of responsibility has been strengthened.

Significant achievements have been made in sports, hygiene, and greening.

All these achievements have been obtained under the leadership of the Party, laying a good foundation for the college's continued development in the future. With further efforts on this basis in the future, our college will surely get better and better every day.

Regarding how to proceed in 1960, the college party committee put forward a 50-article outline of the 1960 work plan. After discussion at the college affairs committee meeting on February 25, a resolution was made to resolutely implement it. I think I won't talk too much about this aspect due to time constraints. I would like to briefly talk about the scientific research situation of Shanxi Agricultural College.

Since the mobilization on New Year's Day 1960, our college's scientific research work, under the direct leadership of the school party committee and after two on-site promotion and evaluation drives, has achieved great results in just a few months. For example, the discovery of virus inclusion bodies in pig asthma, the preliminary success of virus vaccine trial production, the use of microorganisms to improve the nutritional value of crude feed, the use of electrolysis to improve saline-alkali soil, and so on. All of these are promising seedlings with great vitality, sparks that have the potential to start a prairie fire, and are very encouraging. Encouraged by these facts, the thinking of all teachers, students, and staff has been further liberated, and the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, and the style of great collaboration, have been firmly established, creating favorable conditions for further carrying out the movement to climb the peak of science.

Several Characteristics of Scientific Research Work at Shanxi Agricultural College

Currently, our college's scientific research work has the following characteristics:

1.  Teachers, students, and staff are combined, forming a vigorous mass movement under the leadership of the college party committee. Almost every unit in the college is engaged in scientific research to a greater or lesser extent, and each has its own characteristics and has achieved certain results. Even the general affairs department, which has always been considered to have no research to do, has research results, such as homemade vacuum cleaners and homemade salary computers, which have increased work efficiency dozens of times.

2.  The scope of research work is very broad, from technical reforms in all aspects such as sweeping, cooking, processing, teaching, and cultivation, to theoretical and production techniques in all aspects such as plants, animals, microorganisms, soil, fertilizers, and pesticides. It is very broad. And it is proposed to ask microorganisms for feed, and use the microorganisms and lower plants themselves and their activity to improve the nutritional value and digestibility of crude feed; use the principle of "big bone joint" disease to find ways to increase the body size of pigs in order to increase the unit yield of pork, etc.

3.  Advanced technologies have been widely used. Advanced technologies such as ultrasound, isotopes, various rays, electromagnetic fields, trace elements, and electric current have been used as much as possible in research work. Seeds and fruit tree branches treated with these advanced technologies have undergone significant changes. The germination power and growth potential of the treated seeds and fruit tree branches have been improved, which not only provides new possibilities for increasing production, but also creates new conditions for artificial induction of variation, expanding selection, and utilization. Apple, pear, grape, and jujube branches treated with electric current sprout quickly. If the branches can be rooted quickly, a new way will be found for fruit tree cuttings and grafting. This will eliminate the need for cultivating rootstock grafting and other procedures, accelerate fruit tree propagation, and advance fruiting.

4.  All teachers, students, and staff are full of energy, and the style of great collaboration is thriving, creating favorable conditions for carrying out comprehensive research. For example, the "one-stop" research on pigs, the research on high-yield techniques for grain, cotton, and oil crops, and the research on comprehensive utilization of rural products are all carried out jointly by many relevant agencies and personnel inside and outside the school.

We believe that these new characteristics and new atmosphere are very good and very precious, and should continue to be promoted.

Personal Experiences and Opinions

The following are some of my personal experiences and opinions.

1.  Strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command is an important guarantee for carrying out a large amount of scientific research work in schools. The Party gives us instructions on the correct direction of work, the ideological method of dialectical materialism, and the working style of the mass line. With the Party, we can give play to the spirit of all teachers and students daring to think and dare to do, being unyielding and overcoming difficulties; with the Party, we can truly mobilize the masses ideologically and do all our work well.

2.  The purpose of scientific research must first and foremost clarify the principle of science serving proletarian politics. Specifically, for schools, scientific research must serve to improve teaching quality, to improve current agricultural production, and to further develop agricultural scientific theory. Therefore, when each unit proposes scientific research topics, they must first mobilize the masses to evaluate them, and ask what help this topic will be to improve teaching quality? What practical role does it play in improving agricultural production? What is the possibility for future development of agricultural scientific theory? If the evaluation results show that the proposed topic can satisfactorily answer the above three questions, then it is considered a first-class topic, and answering two of them is considered a second-class topic, answering one of them is considered a third-class topic, and not being able to answer one is not counted. Based on the results of mass evaluation and our specific conditions, after repeated research, the leadership decides which to do first, which to do later, and which not to do, and makes an overall plan. With the teaching and research group as a unit, after determining the personnel, measures, and progress, we will earnestly implement it.

3.  Combining specific leadership with inspection and evaluation is a way to quickly achieve scientific research results. The party and government leaders of each unit should frequently understand the situation from the comrades in charge of research work, exchange opinions, and correct deviations. The party and government leaders of the college should listen to work reports from time to time and hold on-site promotion meetings regularly; pushing the work forward wave after wave, wave after wave higher.

4.  The mass movement should be combined with professional research. The mass movement gets the work started, but to persist in it and go deeper, it is not enough to rely solely on the mass movement. In the process of the mass movement, we should discover backbones, select some comrades who are interested, energetic, and capable in a certain topic, and the leadership should consciously reduce their other work to ensure the smooth progress of scientific research in terms of time. This will make the work more detailed and in-depth.

5.  Combining widespread digging of problems and focusing on solving problems. Mobilize the broad masses to explore problems from all aspects and angles. The more problems are explored, the greater the chance of discovering key problems. After the problems are put forward, we can select key points according to specific conditions, needs, and possibilities, distinguish between priorities and urgency, and gradually solve them. This can enrich the content of research, avoid stiffly finding problems, researching for the sake of research, and reduce the blindness of research work.

6.  Sending individuals out and collectively inviting them in is a good way to achieve a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Shanxi Agricultural College has always attached great importance to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Based on the experience of the past two years, I personally believe that sending a few teachers with expertise and theoretical cultivation to learn from indigenous experts for a long time; collectively inviting indigenous experts to conduct short-term exchanges of experience and summaries of experience is very effective for achieving a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Last year, we sent an associate professor, an assistant teacher, and a fourth-year student who lectured on sheep raising to learn from the famous sheep herding expert Comrade Ning Huatang for a year. Not only did they summarize Ning Huatang's rich sheep herding experience, but they also theoretically improved his experience, and both sides benefited from helping and improving each other. In February and March of this year, in order to develop the pig raising industry in Shanxi Province, under the instruction of the provincial party committee and with the support of the agricultural department, more than 100 pig raising experts from all over Shanxi were invited to open a 40-day pig raising training class in conjunction with teachers from the animal husbandry and veterinary medicine department of the agricultural college, technicians from the animal husbandry and veterinary medicine research institute, and fourth-year students. After the indigenous experts lectured and learned from each other to exchange experiences, the foreign experts theoretically summarized and improved, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and both sides improved and felt very satisfied. Based on the summary of the training class, the teaching materials for pig raising were revised to make them more substantial and more practical. Not only that, but through the training class, the teachers and students of the agricultural college and the pig raising experts scattered all over the province established a student relationship and a deep friendship. At the closing ceremony of the training class, the representative of the indigenous experts said that in the past, we thought that the agricultural college was an unfathomable place, but now the agricultural college has become our alma mater, and we must report our work to the agricultural college and ask for help in the future. In this way, the work of the agricultural college is popularized to the whole province, specifically to the pig farms of the communes, laying a solid foundation for the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. This form of combining indigenous and foreign methods can be opened in more categories in the future, which has great benefits.

Comrade representatives, Shanxi Agricultural College is a school with a relatively short history and relatively poor conditions in the country. Although it has achieved great results under the leadership and cultivation of the Party in recent years, it is still not enough. In the future, we must resolutely implement the three-way combination education policy under the leadership of the Party, and with the help of fraternal colleges, run the school better.

Please criticize and correct any inappropriateness in the above speech.

### 山西农学院的科学研究工作  王绶代表的发言

专栏：

    山西农学院的科学研究工作
    王绶代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及人大常委会的工作报告，并衷心拥护，保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我把山西农学院，贯彻三结合教育方针后，所发生的变化，简要的汇报一下。
    山西农学院在院党委直接领导下，坚决贯彻了党中央三结合教育方针，全校师生下放全省各地五个基点，与农民同吃、同住、同劳动一年。在劳动生产的同时，采取教学、科学研究、劳动生产三结合的办法，完成了各年级的主要课程的教学计划，结合教学，结合生产中存在的问题，师生与当地群众结合，广泛地开展了科学研究，在下放各公社进行的科学研究二百七十九项，调查研究二百三十四种，编写讲义六十一种，写成专题论文七百七十一篇。
    山西农学院的师生经过下放锻炼，大炼钢铁与深翻地等运动后学校面貌起了根本性的变化，主要表现在：
    劳动观点和群众观点，在广大的师生员工当中，巩固地建立起来了。师生关系改善了，已形成“教学相长”的、民主的、新的师生关系。
    课程的内容结合了实际，结合了生产，教学质量有了很大的提高。
    科学研究初步形成了群众运动，校内校外同时开展了，并且取得了显著的成绩。
    农场生产空前提高了，1959年小麦平均亩产五百斤零七两，玉米亩产一千斤以上。行政部门的各项工作也都有显著的改善，工作效率大大的提高了，责任心加强了。
    体育锻炼、清洁卫生、绿化等方面，都取得了显著成绩。
    所有这些成绩都是在党的领导下获得的，为我院今后继续发展，奠定了良好的基础。今后在这一基础上，进一步努力，我院一定会一天一天的更加好起来。
    关于1960年如何搞法，院党委提出了关于1960年工作计划纲要五十条。经2月25日院务委员会会议讨论，并作出决议，坚决贯彻执行。我想因为时间关系不多谈这方面的问题。我想把山西农学院的科学研究情况，简要地谈一谈。
    我院的科学研究工作，自从1960年元旦日动员之后，在学校党委直接领导下，经过两次现场促进评比推动下，在短短的几个月内，已取得了很大成绩，例如猪气喘病，病毒包涵体的发现，病毒疫苗试制初步成功，利用微生物提高粗饲料的营养价值，利用电解方法、改良盐碱土等等很多。所有这些都是具有巨大生命力的苗头，是星星之火具有燎原之势的苗头，是很鼓舞人心的。在这些事实的鼓舞下，全院师生员工的思想，得到更进一步解放，敢想敢做与大协作的作风，巩固地建立起来了，为进一步开展攀登科学高峰的运动，创造了有利的条件。
    山西农学院科学研究工作的几个特点
    目前我院科学研究工作，有以下的几个特点：
    一、师生员工相结合，在院党委的领导下，已形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在全院几乎每一个单位，或多或少都在搞科学研究，并且各有千秋，都有一定的成绩。就是一向认为没有研究可搞的单位，总务部门，也有研究的成果，例如土制吸尘器，土制工资计算机，提高工作效率数十倍。
    二、研究工作的面，开展得很广泛，从扫地、做饭、加工、教学、耕作等各方面的技术改革，以至于植物、动物、微生物、土壤、肥料、农药等各方面的理论与生产技术等，面面俱到，很广泛。并且提出了向微生物要饲料，利用微生物和低等植物的本身和它们的活动作用，提高粗饲料的营养价值与可消化率；采用“大骨节”病的原理，寻找增大猪体形的途径，以提高猪肉的单位产量等。
    三、广泛地运用了尖端技术，如超声波、同位素、各种射线、电磁场、微量元素、电流等尖端技术都尽量采用到研究工作中去。根据这些尖端技术所处理过的种子和果树枝条，都起了显著的变化，处理过的种子和果树的枝条，发芽力生长势都提高了，这不但为增加生产提供了新的可能，而且为人工引变扩大选种和利用，创造了新的条件。用电流处理过的苹果、梨、葡萄、枣子等枝条发芽很快，如进一步能使枝条很快的生根，就为果树扦押找到新的门路。这样就免去培育砧木嫁接等手续，加快果树繁殖，与提早结果。
    四、全体师生员工干劲冲天，大兴协作之风，为开展综合研究创造了有利的条件。例如猪的“一条龙”研究，粮棉、油料的丰产技术的研究，农村产品综合利用的研究，都是结合校内校外许多有关机关与人员共同进行的。
    我们认为这些新的特点与新的气象都很好，很可珍视，应该继续加以发扬光大。
        个人的体会和意见
    以下谈一谈我个人的几点体会与意见。
    一、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅是大量开展学校科学研究工作的重要保证。党给我们指示出正确的工作方向，辩证唯物主义的思想方法与群众路线的工作作风。有了党才可以发挥全体师生敢想敢干，百折不挠与克服困难的精神；有了党才可以从思想上真正的发动群众，做好一切工作。
    二、科学研究的目的，首先必须明确科学为无产阶级政治服务的方针。具体到学校来说，科学研究必须为提高教学质量服务，为提高当前农业生产服务，为进一步发展农业科学理论服务。所以当各单位提出科学研究课题的时候，首先要发动群众评议一番，问一问这一课题对提高教学质量有甚么帮助？对提高农业生产起甚么实际作用？对将来发展农业科学理论有甚么可能？如果评议结果认为所提的课题能圆满答复以上三个问题时，那就算是第一等的课题，能答复其中两个问题时，算是第二等，答复其中一个时算第三等，一个问题也不能答复的，算不列等。根据群众评议的结果与我们的具体条件，经过反复研究，领导上决定先做那些，后做那些，不做那些，作出通盘规划。以教研组为单位，经过定人定措施定进度后，认真地加以贯彻执行。
    三、具体领导与检查评比相结合是迅速取得科学研究成果的办法。各单位的党政领导要经常向主持研究工作的同志了解情况，交换意见，纠正偏差。院党政领导要不时地听取工作汇报，并定期召开现场促进会议；一浪推一浪，一浪高一浪地推进工作。
    四、群众运动要与专业研究相结合。群众运动把工作搞起来了，但要坚持下去深入进去，只靠群众运动是不够的。应该在群众运动的过程中，发现骨干，拣选若干对某项课题有兴趣，有干劲，有能力的同志，领导上要有意识的减少他们其他工作，在时间上保证科学研究顺利进行。这样就可使工作做得更细致深入。
    五、广泛地挖掘问题和重点地解决问题相结合。发动广大群众从各个方面与各个角度，发掘问题。发掘的问题越多，发现关键问题的机会就越大。问题摆出来之后，就可以根据具体条件、需要与可能，选择重点分别轻重缓急，逐步的加以解决。这样才可以丰富研究的内容，不致于生硬的找问题，为研究而研究，减少研究工作的盲目性。
    六、个别的派出去与集体的请进来，是实现土洋结合的好办法。山西农学院对土洋结合一向是很重视的。两年来的经验，我个人认为派少数有专长有理论修养的教师跟土专家长期学习；集体请进土专家作短期的交流经验、总结经验，对实现土洋结合很有效。去年我们派出讲授养羊学的副教授、助教与四年级学生各一人，跟著名的牧羊专家宁华堂同志，学习一年。不仅总结了宁华堂的丰富的牧羊经验，而且从理论上也提高了他的经验，双方都得到互相帮助互相提高的好处。今年2、3月间，为了发展山西省的养猪事业，在省委指示与农业厅的支持下，请进山西各地的养猪能手一百余人，结合农学院畜牧兽医系的教师、畜牧兽医研究所的技术人员与四年级学生，开办养猪讲习班四十天。经过土专家自讲自学交流经验，洋专家从理论上总结提高，取长补短，双方都有提高，感到很满意。并根据讲习班的总结，修改了养猪学的讲义，使讲义更加充实，更加切合实际。不但如此，而经过讲习班使农学院的师生与散处各地的养猪能手建立起同学的关系与深厚的友谊。在讲习班结业典礼的大会上，土专家代表说，过去我们认为农学院是深不可入的境地，现在农学院变成我们的母校了，以后我们一定要向农学院汇报工作，请求帮助。这样就把农学院的工作，普及到全省，具体到公社的养猪场，为土洋结合打下牢不可破的基础。像这土洋结合的形式，以后可分门别类的多开办些，是有很大好处的。
    代表同志们，山西农学院在全国来说是历史比较短的条件比较差的学校。几年来在党领导与培养下虽然取得了很大的成绩，但是很不够的。今后一定要在党的领导下，坚决贯彻三结合教育方针，在兄弟院校的帮助下，把学校办得更好。
    以上发言，不妥之处，请各位代表批评指正。
