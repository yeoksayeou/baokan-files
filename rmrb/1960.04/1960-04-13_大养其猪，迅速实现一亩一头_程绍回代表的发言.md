Comrades, esteemed delegates:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. I will resolutely implement them in my future work. Now, I would like to express some opinions on fulfilling the glorious task of one pig per mu ahead of schedule. I welcome your criticism and suggestions:

Regarding the importance of developing the pig-raising industry, Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1956 in his instructions on "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside": "Raising pigs is a major issue concerning fertilizer, meat, and earning foreign exchange through exports. All cooperatives should include pig raising in their plans." In 1959, Chairman Mao further clearly instructed: "The pig is the head of the six domestic animals," "The whole pig is a treasure," and called on the whole Party and the entire people to "raise pigs on a large scale" and achieve "one pig per mu." Chairman Mao's wise instructions and great call are a huge driving force for the continuous leap forward of China's pig-raising industry.

This spring, the number of pigs raised nationwide has steadily increased, breaking the usual pattern of a decline in pig numbers after the Spring Festival. The number of counties with an average of one pig per person has risen from eighteen at the end of last year to forty-one. The situation of pig development in Sichuan Province is also very good. I recently learned that the pig-raising situation in Jianyang, Rongchang, Chongqing, and other places is characterized by rapid development, good pig quality, large numbers, quick solutions to problems using both indigenous and foreign methods, a strong spirit and great enthusiasm among cadres and the masses in studying pig raising, and a growing and improving pig-raising team. The national situation is also the same, forming a vigorous pig-raising movement throughout the country. The rapid development of the pig-raising industry is a victory for the Three Great Banners, and a victory for putting politics in command. The Party secretaries in charge of pig production have rich organizational and leadership experience, understand the business, and study the technology; the masses are full of enthusiasm, ideologically liberated, and creative. According to the current excellent situation, it can be seen that there will be continuous leaps forward in the future. It will only take four or five years to basically complete the glorious and arduous task of one pig per mu (approximately 1.6 billion pigs) nationwide, and many regions can complete it ahead of schedule. The following is a brief introduction to the important developments in pig-raising technology related to the completion of this task in various places.

1.  Solving the Feed Problem: Due to the insufficient supply of concentrated feed for raising a large number of pigs, the Party Central Committee put forward the "policy of raising pigs mainly with green and coarse feed, supplemented by appropriate concentrated feed" in 1957. At that time, some animal husbandry experts did not analyze the specific situation of concentrated feed in China, blindly believed in the foreign method of fattening pigs with a large amount of concentrated feed, and believed that the nutritional value of concentrated and coarse feed could not be improved. Landlords and rich peasants were accustomed to feeding pigs with a large amount of grain. These people had serious ideological resistance to this policy and often shouted, "There is less grain, and pigs cannot be fattened." In the past few years, Party committees and governments at all levels have firmly grasped this policy, and poor and lower-middle peasants have become the masters of pig farms, creating a wealth of experience in fattening pigs mainly with green and coarse feed, supplemented by appropriate concentrated feed. The reason why they can fatten pigs without or with a small amount of concentrated feed is that they believe that the Party's policy is correct, and therefore apply physical (shortening, grinding, cooking), chemical (saccharification), and biological (making into mash, silage, fermentation) methods to modify concentrated and coarse feed to improve their nutritional value for fattening pigs. Their experience can be summarized as "turning coarse feed into fine, and making fine feed even finer to fatten pigs."

Mass production of protein-rich feed is one of the important issues in current feed production. In order not to occupy cultivated land, scientific research units and the masses of farmers are developing fungi and algae rich in protein as feed, and adopting factory production methods to cultivate feed yeast, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, *Streptomyces*, and *Chlorella*, etc.; the required equipment is simple and the cost is low, and general communes can produce them, while their nutritional value is relatively high. This is a new way to increase concentrated feed and crude protein, and can be vigorously promoted. Oxytetracycline is easier to cultivate than chlortetracycline and has a higher potency, and has the effect of promoting the growth and development of young livestock and poultry and weight, preventing white scours in young livestock, and swine enzootic pneumonia, so it should be produced in large quantities for feeding pigs.

It can be seen that large-scale planting of high-yield green feed crops and factory-style production of crude protein feed are two legs walking to solve the key to pig feed. At present, one mu of high-yield green feed in the area south of the Yellow River can supply 10 to 30 fattening pigs. Within four or five years, the average yield of the national feed base will reach more than 50,000 to 60,000 jin per mu, the amount of green and coarse feed will increase greatly, and factory-style production of protein feed will be universally promoted; combined with full utilization of substitutes, agricultural and forestry processing by-products and wild animals and plants as pig feed; scientifically applying physical, chemical, and biological modification methods to improve the nutritional value of feed; it can definitely quickly solve the feed needed to raise 1.6 billion pigs well.

2.  Rapid Reproduction: Sows producing two or two and a half litters a year, with an average of eight to ten piglets per litter, producing sixteen to twenty piglets per year, has been the speed of pig reproduction in China for a long time. After the Great Leap Forward, the masses created the method of sows mating while still suckling, producing three litters a year, and greatly increased the number of piglets per litter by repeatedly mating with several boars from the middle of the sow's estrus. The "multi-boar, multi-mating" breeding method, combined with improved feeding management, has created miracles in Shimen People's Commune in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, where one sow produced sixty-one piglets in one litter, weighing more than eighty jin, and in Fudian People's Commune in Yanshi County, Henan Province, where one sow produced eighty-one piglets in one litter. With widespread application of this method, it is undoubtedly possible to increase the number of piglets produced by most sows by two or three times (thirty to forty piglets per year). Artificial insemination with the semen of several boars mixed can also increase the number of piglets per litter, and multiple artificial insemination also has the effect of producing multiple births. Some people believe that multiple births are not conducive to the development and growth of the mother and piglets, and that if this continues, the breed will deteriorate. They are full of worries. The facts over the past year or so have proved that multiple births, combined with improved feeding management of the mother and piglets, can make the mother and piglets strong, otherwise the mother will be thin and the piglets will be weak. Taking the "multi-boar, multi-mating" mating method as the main method, supplemented by "first litter sows" and "selecting after saving" to solve the shortage of sows, it will be easy to breed 1.6 billion pigs in four or five years.

3.  Improving Pig Breeds: Practice in recent years has proved that economic crossbreeding is the most effective method to improve the economic performance of pigs. Economic crossbred pigs grow fast, are resistant to coarse feed, easy to fatten, and have strong disease resistance. The effect of breeding local pigs with breeds such as Yorkshire, Berkshire, and Soviet Large White pigs to produce first-generation crossbred pigs is the best. China's local excellent breeds, such as Sichuan Rongchang pigs, Yubai pigs, Shaanxi Hanba pigs, Liaoning Xinjin pigs, Heilongjiang Habai pigs, and dozens of other excellent local breeds, can all be used as economic crossbreeding boars. Vigorously promoting economic crossbreeding can enable the quality of pigs nationwide to be universally improved in four or five years, shorten the fattening time and save a lot of feed.

Jinlong Commune in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, used bovine semen to breed Yorkshire hybrid sows, producing the world's first crossbred offspring, thus opening the door to the treasure house of distant hybridization of livestock. This kind of crossbred offspring showed excellent characteristics such as strong disease resistance, fast growth, and resistance to coarse feed, and its morphology was mostly like a sow, with slight genetic influence from the bull. The work of distant hybridization of bovine semen and sows has been rapidly carried out in many communes. Young inseminators have shown a bold creative spirit in the study of this cutting-edge science and have achieved amazing achievements. These achievements are not only conducive to production but also develop the theory of biological genetics. The contribution of the bovine-pig crossbreeding experiment is significant, and the local Party committee and government attach great importance and support to it, and the people of the whole country are greatly encouraged by it. However, some geneticists and animal husbandry scientists with bourgeois academic ideas cling to the animal morphological taxonomy and Morgan's genetic theory, and of course, it is difficult for them to believe in the creation of a socialist society. They will be convinced in the face of a large number of distant hybridization results.

4.  Preventing and Controlling Animal Diseases: Prevention is more important than treatment is the basic principle of preventing and controlling pig diseases. Disease prevention practices in various places have proved that continuously improving feeding management, strengthening environmental hygiene, eliminating sources of infection and causes of disease, pig farms can go years without a pig dying, and diseases are rare. Various infectious diseases can be eliminated by adopting comprehensive prevention measures such as blockade, isolation, disinfection, treatment, preventive injection, and disposal of corpses. Therefore, local governments and communes need to establish quarantine systems and institutions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the process of buying and selling and transporting live pigs and their products, and universally preventive injections to prevent the occurrence of epidemic diseases. There should be a regular disinfection system when there is no disease, and the number of times should be increased when there is a disease. Sichuan's white pigsty movement is a successful experience and is worth promoting. Strengthening quarantine institutions, enriching veterinary personnel, equipment and medicines, and implementing prevention-oriented measures will inevitably guarantee the health of 1.6 billion pigs.

5.  Feeding Management: With the great development of collective pig raising, the experience and system of feeding management of large groups of pigs have been greatly enriched. The management principle of "knowing the pig's temperament and teaching according to its temperament" has revolutionary changed the past erroneous idea that "stupid pigs love dirt." The feeders of Tushan People's Commune in Chongqing City analyzed the personality of pigs, including naughty, fierce, and timid, treated them differently, taught them according to their temperament, carefully taught them, patiently taught them to obey the order, live a life of system, rest on time, obey command, love cleanliness, and defecate in designated places. Pigs have three strictly separated places, "dormitory", "canteen" and "toilet", all of which can be kept clean and hygienic, and the pigs are clean and shiny. Sichuan farmers call this method "three separations in a column feeding", which can save manpower and construction funds, and also facilitate management and accumulate a lot of fertilizer. Setting up a "nutrition canteen" for weak pigs, a "nursery" for piglets, and a "pig hospital" for sick pigs, thereby reducing the death of pigs.

The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee in Shandong Province advocates a feeding method of fine grinding of concentrated feed, fine grinding of coarse feed and then cooking it, and then adding a large amount of water (ten to fifty times), and feeding it multiple times (twelve to fifteen times day and night) is a technological innovation in feeding. This can save concentrated feed (one jin of concentrated feed grows one jin of meat), increase pig urine and rapidly increase weight. This new method should be given attention and further tested.

Many places across the country have adopted "scientific fattening methods", such as Chongqing, Sichuan, which promotes two cuts (tail and ears), two feeds (fattening pig slices and salt), and two shots (tissue fluid and glucose) according to the laws of growth.

These new feeding management methods ensure that the mother is strong and the children are fat, creating favorable conditions for the development of pigs to 1.6 billion in four or five years.

6.  Mechanization and Electrification of Pig Raising: The technological innovation and technological revolution in pig raising have the momentum of one day equaling twenty years. Various places have implemented the policy of "using foreign methods if possible, using indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and going from indigenous to foreign." Pig farms with relatively poor conditions mainly use indigenous methods to realize mechanization of feed processing, automation of water supply, ditching of manure discharge, and vehicle transportation, which not only greatly reduces workers, but also eliminates heavy physical labor. After the Nankou Breeding Farm of Chongqing Food Company realized mechanization and electrification, the average number of pigs fattened by one person in the past increased from thirty-five to five hundred, and the highest was more than one thousand per person. The characteristics of the pig-raising mechanization movement are adapting to local conditions, using local materials, having many methods, rapid improvement, and carrying out communist cooperation to solve difficulties in materials and technology. The work efficiency of one person averaging feeding management of ten to thirty pigs in the past has been greatly improved in a very short period of time. It can be seen that in the next four or five years, the breeding of 1.6 billion pigs nationwide will not greatly increase the number of pig breeders, but will reduce the current number of pig breeders.

Under the brilliant light of the general line and under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have widely studied Mao Zedong Thought, and pig-raising technology has had many creative developments. We firmly believe that it will be improved greater, faster, and more in the future. Under the correct leadership of the Party, mobilizing the masses to widely promote these new technologies will enable the country to raise 1.6 billion pigs in four or five years. Let us resolutely strive to complete the glorious and arduous task of one pig per mu ahead of schedule!

I wish the conference a successful conclusion and all the representatives good health!

专栏：

    大养其猪，迅速实现一亩一头
    程绍回代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。在今后工作中我坚决贯彻执行。现在我仅就提前完成一亩一猪的光荣任务发表一些意见，请代表们批评指正：
    关于发展养猪事业的重要性，毛主席早在1956年在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”的批语中就提出：“养猪是关系肥料、肉食和出口换取外汇的大问题，一切合作社都要将养猪一事放在自己的计划内。”1959年毛主席更明确地指示：“猪为六畜之首”，“生猪全身是宝”，并号召全党全民“大养其猪”，实现“一亩地一头猪”。毛主席的英明指示和伟大号召是我国养猪事业不断跃进的巨大推动力量。
    今春全国养猪头数稳定上升，打破往年春节后猪数下降的常规，平均一人一头猪的县已由去年年底的十八个上升到四十一个。四川省生猪发展的形势也很好。我最近了解简阳、荣昌、重庆等地的养猪形势是发展快，生猪质量好数量多，办法土洋并举解决问题快，干群钻研养猪精神强、劲头大，养猪队伍壮大、水平提高。全国形势也是如此，举国形成一个轰轰烈烈的养猪运动。养猪事业的迅速发展是三大万岁的胜利，是政治挂帅的胜利。主管生猪生产的党委书记有丰富的组织领导经验，懂业务，钻技术；群众的干劲冲天，思想解放，创造力强。根据目前的大好形势，可以看出今后将继续不断的跃进，只要四、五年的时间就可基本实现全国一亩一猪（约十六亿头）的光荣而艰巨的任务，有许多地区还可提前完成。兹将各地与完成这一任务有关的养猪技术重要发展简要地介绍于下。
    一、解决饲料方面：由于大量养猪的精饲料不足，党中央于1957年提出：“以青绿粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料的养猪方针”。当时有一部分畜牧专家不分析中国精饲料的具体情况，迷信于外国以大量精饲料肥猪的方法，并认为精、粗饲料的营养价值不能改善提高。地主富农习于用大量粮食喂猪。这些人对于这个方针在思想上有严重的抵触，经常喊叫“粮食少了，喂不肥猪了”。几年来各级党政抓紧了这个方针，而在养猪场上贫农和下中农当了家，才创造了以青绿粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料养肥猪的丰富经验。他们能不用精饲料或用少量精饲料肥育猪的原因在于相信党的方针是正确的，因而应用物理的（截短磨细煮熟）化学的（醣化）和生物的（变糟青贮发酵）的方法调制精、粗饲料改进其营养价值以肥育猪。他们的经验可以总结为“粗料变精，精料更精养肥猪”。
    大量生产蛋白质丰富的饲料是当前饲料生产重要问题之一。为了不占用耕地，科学研究单位与农民群众正在发展含蛋白质多的菌类藻类作饲料，采用工厂生产方式培养饲料酵母、固氮菌、链孢菌和小球藻等；所需设备简单，成本低廉，一般公社可以生产，而其营养价值较高。这是增加精饲料和粗蛋白质的一个新途径，可以大力推广。土霉菌较金霉菌易于培养而效价更高，且有促进幼畜幼禽的生长发育和体重、防止幼畜白痢、猪喘气病的功效，故宜大量生产，用以喂猪。
    由此可见，大量种植青绿的高产饲料作物和工厂式生产含粗蛋白质饲料是两条腿走路解决猪饲料的关键。现在黄河以南地区一亩地的高产青绿饲料已能供肥育十至三十头猪之用。四、五年内全国的饲料基地平均亩产将达五、六万斤以上，青绿粗饲料将大量增加，工厂式生产蛋白质饲料将普遍推行；结合充分地利用代用品，农林业加工副产品和野生动植物作猪饲料；科学地应用物理的化学的生物的调制方法改进饲料营养价值；一定可以迅速解决养好十六亿猪所需的饲料。
    二、快速繁殖方面：母猪一年生两窝或两窝半，每窝平均八到十个仔猪，年产仔十六到二十个是我国长期以来繁殖猪的速度。大跃进后，群众创造了母猪配热窝一年生三窝的方法，于母猪发情中期开始用几个公猪多次交配的方法大大地提高了每窝产仔数。“多公多次配”结合改善饲养管理的配种方法已在山东诸城县石门人民公社创造出一头母猪一窝产六十一头仔猪，窝重八十多斤，在河南郾师县府店人民公社一头母猪一窝产八十一头仔猪等奇迹。广泛应用此法，则大部分母猪的产仔数提高二、三倍（一年产三、四十个）将是无疑的。几个公猪的精液混合后进行人工授精也可以提高每窝产仔数，多次人工授精也有一胎多产之效。有人认为多胎多产对于母仔发育生长均不利，若长此以往能使品种变劣。他们顾虑重重。经过一年多来的事实证明多胎多产结合改善母仔的饲养管理，可以使母仔健壮，否则母瘦仔弱。以“多公多次配”的交配方法为主，辅以“一产母猪”和“先留后选”以解决母猪不足，则四、五年内繁殖十六亿猪将是易举之事。
    三、改良猪种方面：几年来实践证明经济杂交是提高猪经济性能最易见效的方法。经济杂交猪生长快，耐粗食，易育肥，抗病力较强。以约克、巴克、苏联大白猪等品种配本地猪产生杂交一代猪的效果最好。我国地方优良品种如四川荣昌猪、渝白猪，陕西汉巴猪，辽宁新金猪，黑龙江哈白猪及其他几十种优良地方品种都可作经济杂交公猪之用。大力推广经济杂交可使全国生猪在四、五年内普遍提高品质，缩短肥育时间并节省大量饲料。
    四川重庆市金龙公社以牛精液配约克杂种母猪产生了世界上第一次杂交后代，从而打开了牲畜远缘杂交宝库之门。这种杂交后代表现了抗病力较强，生长较快，耐粗饲料等优良性能，而其形态则多像母猪，略有公牛的遗传影响。牛精配母猪的远缘杂交工作已在不少的公社迅速开展。青年的配种员对此种尖端科学的研究表现了大胆创造精神，获得了惊人的成就。这些成就不仅有利于生产而且发展了生物遗传学的理论。牛精猪杂交试验的贡献重大，当地党政极为重视和支持，全国人民给以很大鼓舞。但有些资产阶级学术思想的遗传学家和畜牧学家死抱着动物形态分类学和莫尔根的遗传学观点，对于社会主义社会的创造当然很难置信。他们将在大量的远缘杂交成果面前信服的。
    四、防治兽疫方面：防重于治，是防治猪病的基本方针。各地防疫实践证明：不断改善饲养管理，加强环境卫生，消灭疫源和病因，则养猪场可几年不死一头猪，而疾病也很少。各种传染病均可采用封锁、隔离、消毒、治疗、预防注射、处理尸体等综合防疫措施达到消灭。因此地方政府和公社均需要建立检疫制度和机构以防止传染病在买卖运输生猪及其产品的过程中散布蔓延、普遍预防注射以预防疫病发生。无病时应有经常的消毒制度，有病时则增加次数。四川的白猪圈运动是成功的经验，值得推广。加强检疫机构，充实兽医人员、设备和药械，实施防重于治的措施，则十六亿猪的健康必然得到保证。
    五、饲养管理方面：随着集体养猪的大发展，对大群养猪的饲养管理经验和制度已大为丰富。“养猪知猪性，因性施教”的管理原则是革命性地改变了过去认为“笨猪爱脏”的错误思想。重庆市涂山人民公社的饲养员分析了猪的性格，有调皮的、烈性的和胆小的，分别对待，因性施教，细心教，耐心教使猪守秩序，生活制度，按时休息，听从指挥，爱清洁，在指定地点大小便。猪有“宿舍”、“食堂”和“厕所”三处严格分开，均能保持清洁卫生，而猪身干净，油光水滑。四川农民称之为“通栏饲养三分开”的方法，既可节省人力和建筑经费，还能管理方便和大量积肥。为瘦弱猪办理“营养食堂”，为仔猪设“托儿所”，为病猪开“猪医院”，因而减少了生猪的死亡。
    山东招远县委提倡精料细磨，粗料细磨后煮熟，再加大量水（十至五十倍），多次喂给（日夜十二至十五次）的饲养方法是一种饲养技术革新。这样可以节省精饲料（一斤精饲料长一斤肉），增加猪尿并迅速增加体重。这种新方法应予重视和进一步试用。
    全国许多地方采用“科学催肥法”，如四川重庆推行根据生长规律，两割（尾巴和耳朵），两喂（肥猪片和盐巴），两打（组织浆和葡萄糖）。
    这些新的饲养管理方法保证母壮儿肥，给四、五年内生猪发展到十六亿头创造了有利条件。
    六、养猪机械化电气化方面：养猪方面的技术革新和技术革命有一日等于二十年之势。各地贯彻执行了“能洋则洋，不能洋则土，土洋并举，从土到洋”的方针。条件比较差的猪场则以土为主，实现饲料加工机械化、饮水自流化、排粪沟渠化、运输车子化，不仅工人大大地减少，而笨重的体力劳动得以消灭。重庆市食品公司南溪口饲养场实现了机械化电气化之后，过去一人平均养肥猪三十五头，现在提高到五百头，最高的一人养一千头以上。养猪机械化运动的特点是因地制宜，就地取材，办法多，改进快，搞共产主义大协作，以解决物资和技术上的困难。过去一人平均饲养管理十到三十头猪的工作效率，在很短的时间内已大大地提高。由此可见今后四、五年内全国养猪十六亿头将不是大大增加养猪人员而将要减少目前的养猪人数。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我国人民广泛地学习了毛泽东思想，养猪技术已有许多创造性的发展，我们深信今后将更大更快更多地提高。在党的正确领导下，发动群众广泛地推行这些新技术，则全国饲养十六亿猪，将可在四、五年内实现。让我们坚决地为提前完成一亩一猪的光荣而艰巨的任务努力奋斗！
    祝大会胜利成功，各位代表身体健康！
