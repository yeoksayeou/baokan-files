Chairman, fellow representatives:

    We fully agree with and support the two reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. The great tasks of continuing the leap forward this year, as proposed in the reports, have greatly encouraged us. We guarantee to resolutely implement them in our practical work.

    Now, we will report to the conference on the leap forward in Fujian Province's education undertakings, especially the development of the newly emerging agricultural middle schools. If there is anything inappropriate, we hope the representatives will offer criticism and corrections.

    Education Undertakings Have Achieved High-Speed Development

    Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our province's education undertakings have achieved tremendous success with high-speed development, completing our province's second five-year plan for education undertakings three years ahead of schedule, and further improving the quality of education. General education has leaped into the advanced ranks of the country. Currently, the province has twenty-one universities and colleges, with more than 17,000 university students, seven times the highest number before liberation. There are one hundred and thirty-six secondary vocational schools, with 35,000 students, more than two times the highest number before liberation. There are four hundred and sixteen full-time middle schools, with 240,000 students, more than four times the highest number before liberation. There are five hundred and sixty agricultural middle schools, with more than 40,000 students, and approximately 2 million primary school students, three times the highest number before liberation; more than 90% of school-age children are entering primary school, and more than 900,000 children are receiving pre-school education in kindergartens. Nearly 3 million people have been freed from illiteracy, and the proportion of non-illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province has reached 78%. A massive education network is now taking shape in the province. Each special district and city has universities and colleges, and industrial, agricultural, medical, and normal secondary vocational schools; each county has full-time complete middle schools and normal schools, and some counties also have secondary vocational schools; every commune has secondary schools, and every production team has primary schools and kindergartens. A new situation of an all-round leap forward has emerged in our province's education undertakings. This is a great victory for the Party's General Line on the education front.

    Agricultural Middle Schools are Increasingly Consolidated and Improved

    With the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the high-speed development of education undertakings in our province, agricultural middle schools in our province have grown, strengthened, and become increasingly consolidated and improved. Our province's agricultural middle schools developed in 1958. They are a product of the Great Leap Forward, a result of implementing the Party's education policy, and an important method for developing secondary education in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The superiority of the people's communes has provided even more favorable conditions for the development and consolidation of agricultural middle schools. Over the past two years, thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels and the strong support of the broad masses, the schools have implemented the Party's education policy, adhered to the part-work, part-study system, and the vast majority of agricultural middle schools have become increasingly developed and consolidated, with continuously improving teaching quality. There are currently five hundred and sixty agricultural middle schools in the province, with 41,200 students. This year, more than 1,300 of the first graduates will take up positions in agricultural construction or enter higher-level schools for further training. Agricultural middle schools have taken root in the countryside and become an important base for realizing the cultural revolution and the technical revolution in the countryside.

    Agricultural Middle Schools Grasp Teaching with One Hand and Productive Labor with the Other

    Our province's agricultural middle schools resolutely implement the education policy of combining education with productive labor. School leaders grasp teaching with one hand and productive labor with the other. On the basis of resolving ideological understanding, they pay attention to properly arranging teaching and productive labor, and arrange plans according to the agricultural season and production characteristics. They flexibly manage according to the principles of less study during busy farming seasons, more study during slack seasons, flexible study during peak seasons, and full-day study on rainy days, as well as the different characteristics of the school's teachers, students, work, and life, so that teaching plans are fully realized and teaching quality is continuously improved. The teaching quality of Chinese language and mathematics in one hundred and twenty agricultural middle schools in the province has reached or approached the level of full-time ordinary middle schools. Because agricultural middle schools are part-work, part-study, they can quickly apply the knowledge they have learned to production, directly serve production, and promote production; and because they have production practice, their understanding of the courses they have studied is also deeper and more solid. In order to implement part-work, part-study, schools have established production bases, running farms, livestock farms, and handicraft workshops (or factories). This is not only conducive to solving the school's funding, but also to continuously improving teaching quality, providing important conditions for carrying out scientific research work, and promoting the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research in schools. Many schools, while doing a good job in teaching and productive labor, have carried forward the spirit of daring to think and act, engaging in agricultural scientific research, experimentation, and promotion work, and have achieved remarkable results. Agricultural middle schools in Longxi, Yunxiao, and other counties combine agricultural production and scientific research, actively improving soil, innovating agricultural tools, and resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Therefore, yields are higher than general yields in the local area, playing a technical guidance role in agricultural production. Jin Dou Agricultural Middle School in Yongchun created a foot-operated grass cutter and a hand-operated seed drill, increasing work efficiency threefold. Liaoyan Agricultural Middle School in Lianjiang tried planting eighty-five kinds of cash crops, and the average yield per mu of taro and vegetables reached the highest in the county. This type of school has actually become a stronghold of rural cultural and technical revolution. Agricultural middle schools enable students to be tempered in productive labor, improve their ideological awareness, and strengthen their labor perspective. Many students have become production experts. Teachers and students of Longxi County Agricultural Middle School were brave and tenacious in the struggle against three typhoons and in the construction of seawalls last year, and were not afraid of hardship. Agricultural middle school students also actively participate in social activities, and have become an important force in rural areas in publicizing the Party's General Line, eliminating the four pests and promoting sanitation, carrying out the literacy campaign, and mass cultural activities. Last year, a total of one hundred and nine agricultural middle schools in the province were praised and rewarded by the prefectural, county Party committees, and commune Party committees. Many students have improved their political awareness through education and have been honorably admitted into the Party and the League, and many students have been rated as "three-good" students. Under the leadership of Party committees in various localities, agricultural middle schools have made remarkable achievements in self-reliance, diligence, and building schools through labor. According to incomplete statistics last year, agricultural middle schools throughout the province ran more than 330 factories, farms, and livestock farms, with an area of more than 16,500 mu of farmland, forest, and orchards. Generally, schools have fixed and certain-scale factories, farms, or livestock farms, creating favorable conditions for properly arranging teaching and labor, and implementing part-work, part-study. According to incomplete understanding, fifty-five agricultural middle schools throughout the province have realized self-sufficiency in teachers' salaries, fifty-three have achieved partial self-sufficiency, sixty-one have achieved self-sufficiency in student meals, and ninety-five can partially achieve self-sufficiency. Langqi Agricultural Middle School in Minhou has achieved self-sufficiency in school office expenses, teachers' salaries, and student meals. Jiyang Agricultural Middle School in Jian'ou had an average of one thousand catties of grain per person last year, so students can eat and study without paying, and they also have some pocket money; in addition to achieving self-sufficiency in student meals and tuition fees, Fangdao Agricultural Middle School also issued each student a set of uniforms, a cotton wool shirt, a vest, and ten yuan of pocket money. This not only saves the state's education funds, but also reduces the economic burden on students' families. The masses enthusiastically praised the agricultural middle schools: "The part-work, part-study method is good, both culture and production are improved, students have become all-rounders, and they can do agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations."

    Agricultural middle schools are one of the emerging education undertakings. In a short period of time, they have achieved great success, and the powerful power of the people's communes fundamentally guarantees their healthy growth. We firmly believe that under the strong leadership of the Party, this year our province's agricultural middle schools, like other education work, will continue to leap forward on the basis of existing achievements, and will increasingly play a significant role in the rural cultural revolution and technical revolution.

    农业中学已在农村扎根
    刘永生、郑依牳、周菊珍代表谈福建教育事业的跃进主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两个报告，报告中所提出的今年继续跃进的伟大任务，使我们受到很大鼓舞，我们保证在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我们把福建省教育事业的跃进情况特别是新兴的农业中学的发展情况，向大会作个汇报，如有不妥之处，望代表们批评指正。
    教育事业取得了高速度的发展
    我省教育事业在总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了高速度发展的巨大成就，提前三年完成了我省教育事业的第二个五年计划，进一步提高了教育质量，普通教育已跃入全国先进行列。现在，全省高等学校有二十一所，大学生一万七千余人，为解放前最高年度的七倍。中等专业学校一百三十六所，学生三万五千人，为解放前最高年度的两倍多。全日制中学四百一十六所，学生二十四万人，为解放前最高年度的四倍多。农业中学五百六十所，学生四万余人，小学生约二百余万人，为解放前最高年度的三倍；90％以上学龄儿童都进入小学学习，有九十余万幼儿在幼儿园受到学前教育。扫除文盲近三百万人，全省青壮年非文盲已达78％。现在全省已开始形成规模巨大的教育网。各专、市都有高等学校和工、农、医、师中等专业学校；各县有全日制完全中学和师范，有的县还有中等专业学校；社社都有中等学校，队队都有小学和幼儿园。我省教育事业出现了全面跃进的新形势，这是党的总路线在教育战线上的伟大胜利。
    农业中学日益巩固和提高
    随着我省工农业生产的持续跃进和教育事业的高速度发展，我省农业中学从成长、壮大并日益得到巩固和提高。我省农业中学是在1958年发展起来的，它是大跃进的产物，是贯彻党的教育方针的结果，是多快好省发展中学教育的一个重要方法。而人民公社的优越性又给农业中学的发展、巩固提供了更为有利的条件。两年来，由于各级党委加强了领导，广大群众大力支持，学校贯彻执行了党的教育方针，坚持了半工半读制度，绝大多数农业中学已经日趋发展、巩固，教学质量不断提高。全省现有农业中学五百六十所，学生四万一千二百余人，今年内将有一千三百多名第一届毕业生走上农业建设岗位或升入高一级学校继续培养。农业中学已在农村扎下根，成为农村中实现文化革命和技术革命的一个重要基地。
    农业中学一手抓教学，一手抓生产劳动
    我省农业中学，坚决贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合教育方针，学校领导做到一手抓教学，一手抓生产劳动，在解决思想认识的基础上，注意妥善安排教学和生产劳动，根据农时季节、生产特点安排计划，根据农忙少学、农闲多学、大忙机动学、雨天整天学的原则以及学校教师学生工作生活不同的特点灵活握掌，使教学计划完满实现，教学质量不断提高。全省已有一百二十所农业中学的语文、数学教学质量赶上或接近全日制普通中学的水平。农业中学因为是半工半读，所以能够较快地把学到的知识用在生产上，直接服务生产、推动生产；又因为有了生产实践，所以对所学课程的理解也比较深刻，比较牢固。为了实行半工半读，学校都建立了生产基地，大办农场、畜牧场和手工工场（或工厂），这不仅有利于解决学校经费，而且也有利于不断提高教学质量，为开展科学研究工作提供了重要条件，推动了在学校中实现教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合。不少学校在搞好教学和生产劳动的同时，发扬了敢想敢做的精神，从事农业科学研究、试验和推广工作，取得了显著成绩。龙溪、云霄等县农业中学把农业生产和科学研究结合起来，积极改良土壤，革新农具，坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，因此产量高于当地一般产量，对农业生产起了技术指导作用，永春锦斗农业中学，创造了脚踏切草机、手摇条播机，工效提高三倍。连江蓼沿农业中学试种了八十五种经济作物，芋头、蔬菜平均亩产量达到全县第一。这一类学校实际上已成为农村文化、技术革命的据点。农业中学使学生在生产劳动中得到锻炼，提高了思想觉悟，加强了劳动观点，许多学生成为生产能手。龙溪县农业中学师生在去年三次抗风抢险和修筑海堤的斗争中，个个勇敢顽强，不畏艰险。农业中学学生还积极参加社会活动，在宣传党的总路线、除四害讲卫生运动、扫盲运动和群众文化活动方面，成为农村中一支重要力量。去年全省共有一百零九所农业中学得到地、县委和公社党委的表扬和奖励。有不少学生经过教育，提高了政治觉悟，已经光荣的被吸收入党入团，许多学生被评为“三好”学生。在各地党委领导下，农业中学在自力更生、勤工俭学、劳动建校方面做出了显著的成绩。据去年不完全统计，全省农业中学共办工厂、农场、畜牧场三百三十多个，农、林、果园面积达一万六千五百多亩，一般学校都有了固定和一定规模的工厂、农场或畜牧场，为妥善安排教学与劳动、贯彻半工半读创造了有利条件。据不完全了解全省农业中学有五十五所实现教师工资自给，五十三所做到部分自给，六十一所做到学生伙食自给，九十五所可以部分自给。闽侯琅岐农业中学已做到学校办公费、教师工资、学生伙食三自给。建瓯吉阳农业中学去年全校平均每人有一千斤粮食，做到学生吃饭、读书不要钱，还有一点零用费；房道农业中学除做到学生伙食、学费自给外，还发给学生每人一套制服、一件棉毛衣、一件背心和十元零用钱。这不仅节省了国家教育经费，也减轻学生家庭经济负担。群众热烈称赞农业中学：“半工半读办法好，文化生产两提高，学生成了多面手，农林牧副都会搞”。
    农业中学是新兴的教育事业之一，在短短的时间里已经取得了很大的成绩，人民公社的强大威力从根本上保证了它的健康成长。我们坚信，在党的坚强领导下，今年我省农业中学将和其他各项教育工作一样，在已有成就的基础上继续向前跃进，并在农村文化革命、技术革命中越来越显著地发挥它的巨大作用。
