Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 29th. Korean newspapers today published news on the front page about the 600,000 people in Beijing, the capital of China, holding a rally to support the patriotic and righteous struggle of the South Korean people. They also published in full the speech by Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the All-China Federation of trade unions, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the meeting, and the telegram from the meeting. Newspapers also published commentaries on this.

"Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary saying that the support and solidarity of 650 million Chinese brothers and the support of kind people all over the world give infinite encouragement to the Korean people who have stood up for a just cause. For this, the Korean people are always grateful.

The commentary said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people. It has turned South Korea and Taiwan into atomic war bases for aggression against Asia, hinders the Korean and Chinese people from unifying their countries, and seriously threatens the peaceful life of the people of the two countries and all Asian people. Today, the Korean and Chinese people are fighting against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and realizing the great cause of unifying the motherland, guarding the eastern frontier of socialism and peace.

The commentary said that today, the Korean and Chinese people, starting from common goals and tasks, support and aid each other in a common struggle, and regard this as their brotherly obligation. The Korean people fully support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and resolutely condemn the American aggressors for forcibly occupying China's Taiwan.

The commentary said that the Korean people, with the support and solidarity of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, are invincible and will surely win in their just struggle.

"Minju Choson" published a commentary saying that the powerful voice of 650 million Chinese people supporting the just struggle of the South Korean people has made U.S. imperialism and its lackeys tremble, and showed the world the invincible force of the Korean and Chinese people united in the common just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said that the Korean people, infinitely encouraged by the support and solidarity of 650 million Chinese people, will surely achieve final victory in their just struggle.
