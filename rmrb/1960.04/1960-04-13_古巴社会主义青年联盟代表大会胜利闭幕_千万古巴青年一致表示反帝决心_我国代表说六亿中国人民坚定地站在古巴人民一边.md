Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 11th: The Fourth Congress of the Cuban Socialist Youth League victoriously closed last night in a chorus of cheers of "Unity! Unity! Unity!". Millions of Cuban youths participating in the closing ceremony unanimously expressed their determination to defend the Cuban revolution and oppose imperialist aggression.

    On the closing day, hundreds of uniformed male and female youth militia members of the Cuban Socialist Youth League marched in formation, majestically approaching the venue. They wore portraits of the great Cuban anti-imperialist leader Julio Antonio Mella on their chests and held aloft countless Cuban national flags and colored banners.

    Ramon Calcines, General Secretary of the Cuban Socialist Youth League, emphasized at the closing ceremony that the characteristic of revolutionary unity of the congress was prominently displayed in the attendance of the main representatives of the various revolutionary youth factions of Cuba and in the many supportive telegrams received by the congress. He said that the Socialist Youth League extended its hand to all Cuban youth, including Catholic youth, in order to defend the motherland and the revolution. The vast crowd present cheered and saluted the congress's call to establish a strong, unified youth organization with a revolutionary program, including all Cuban revolutionary youth, which was announced by Calcines.

    Escalante, Executive Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, spoke at the congress, expressing the People's Socialist Party's support for the establishment of such a youth organization. He called on Cuban revolutionary youth to unite and break down sectarian boundaries.

    He emphasized that the main characteristic of this congress was the desire for unity in serving the people, and that the congress had contributed to the cause of unity among revolutionary forces.

    Qian Liren, head of the Chinese youth delegation, said: "Your struggle is supported by the people of all Latin American countries who are fighting for independence, by all the people of Asia and Africa, and by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Six hundred million Chinese people and the people of the world stand firmly on your side." At this point, the audience rose to their feet and responded with thunderous applause. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world.

    García Ponce, General Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Venezuela, announced that Venezuelan volunteer militia members would participate in the militia review and parade in Havana on May 1st to oppose imperialist aggression and defend the Cuban revolution. He said that thousands of young people in Venezuela have already signed up to join the volunteer army to defend the Cuban revolution.

    Pierre Eli, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, expressed congratulations and support to the congress on behalf of 87 million youths in 97 countries.
