Comrade members,

I fully endorse the report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun to the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, and the report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. These two reports present us with an irrefutable depiction of the great picture of the continued great leap forward of our 650 million people, and point out new goals for us to strive for. After listening to the reports, I am even more elated and have increased confidence and strength. I firmly state that I must implement them in future work.

I completely agree with the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. From the report, it can be seen that in the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the National Committee has done a lot of work and achieved great results, playing an active role in consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front.

Comrade members, it has been a year since the last meeting. During this period, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the country have held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and launched a movement against right-leaning tendencies, to boost morale, increase production and practice economy. As a result, continued great leaps forward have been achieved in industry, agriculture, transportation, science and technology, culture and education. The same is true for medical and health work, which is in a state of sustained leap forward. For decades, I have been engaged in maternal and child health work. From the old society to the new society, I have experienced a tremendous change and feel it deeply. Before liberation, in Lanzhou, I used borrowed money to build a so-called maternal and child health clinic with less than ten rooms, with a maximum of only nineteen beds. I was the only doctor. At that time, the reactionary government also had so-called health institutions, but they simply did not care about maternal and child health, and never cared about the suffering of the masses. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, maternal and child health services have greatly developed, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development has been even more rapid. At present, throughout the province, every county and commune has established maternal and child health institutions. The maternal and child health clinic with only nineteen beds before liberation has now developed into an obstetrics and gynecology hospital with two hundred beds. This hospital not only solves difficult and complicated obstetrical and gynecological diseases, but also widely and deeply promotes maternal and child health knowledge among the masses, and firmly implements the Party's health policy of "prevention first." For example, it gives full play to the masses in carrying out the work of eliminating pests and diseases. From January to mid-March this year, it eliminated 296 rats, dug up 111.2 catties of pupae, caught more than 4,000 flies, cleared 150 tons of garbage, and accumulated 133 tons of fertilizer. In the widespread promotion of health knowledge, our hospital adhered to the method of "propaganda first, inserting our foot in every meeting," making full use of New Year's Day, festivals, Sundays, voluntary labor and other opportunities, using costumed performances, broadcasting, clapper talks, blackboard newspapers, leaflets, slogans and other forms to conduct propaganda and education among the masses, making the masses realize the importance of hygiene. In addition, it also carried out the work of district medical care under the leadership of the urban area, and conscientiously implemented the policy of expanding prevention and using hospitals as the center to guide local and factory and mine health and epidemic prevention work. In order to further serve maternal and child health work for industrial and agricultural production, our hospital, after the provincial health administration conference, has been linked to four special zones, two autonomous prefectures, and five city hospitals, and dispatches medical staff to Gannan, Wudu, Lintao water diversion construction sites, Baiyin City and other places for mobile medical services according to needs. It also accepts midwives and health workers to come to the hospital for further studies, and assists the Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital in performing surgeries, consultations, and accepting referrals for difficult labor. After the establishment of the obstetrics and gynecology hospital (late July 1959), the quality of medical care has also improved, with an obstetrics treatment rate of 98.82%, a gynecology treatment rate of 96.83%, a premature infant survival rate of 95%, and a full-term infant survival rate reaching 100%. In terms of integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine, we actively engage in scientific research, using the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine for treatment, reaching more than 90%, with good treatment results. For example, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease is a relatively stubborn disease in gynecology. In the past, Western medicine treatment had a long course and low efficacy. We have adopted a special study of treating chronic pelvic inflammatory disease with the traditional Chinese medicine "Jie He Ru Mei Tang" (结核乳没汤, Knotty, Frankincense and Myrrh Decoction), and according to the observation of the treatment effect of 51 cases, the treatment rate reached 96%, with two cases improved, and currently there are more than 60 cases still under observation. In addition, facing production and everything for the patient, we have further improved our service attitude. In implementing the policy of running the hospital diligently and thriftily, we have launched a production increase and economy movement centered on technological revolution, such as self-made injections, placenta powder, collection of human milk, collection of placental blood, etc., and increased production by 2,330.074 yuan from January 1st to March 15th. In terms of saving, we have extensively adopted traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture treatment and preventive methods, and reduced the consumption of valuable medicines under the principle of not affecting the quality of medical care. In terms of drought resistance and production: in response to the call of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, the whole Party and the whole people were mobilized to launch a drought resistance and production movement. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the branch secretary personally took command and directed the battle, stipulating that five days a week are collective labor days, organizing production commando teams, and cadres taking turns to go down for one month to engage in production labor. In the hospital, in addition to 36% of the staff working or laboring outside for a long time, there are 73 staff members in the hospital. In addition to daily medical and nursing work, they have reclaimed eight acres of land, turned over fifteen acres of land, and irrigated twenty-three acres of land, which have now been completely sown. All employees of the hospital are determined to fight for victory over drought and to ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the "100 jin of potatoes, 100 jin of pumpkins" task with a strong will to conquer nature and a soaring revolutionary spirit. From the above small achievements, it can be seen that without the correct leadership of the Party, the maternal and child health cause would be difficult to have such a huge change.

Before coming to this meeting, I inspected the sanitation situation on Fulongping in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, and now I will introduce their leap forward situation. Everyone knows that our country is "poor and blank," and Gansu is even poorer and blanker. Fulongping in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, is on the mountain. Before liberation, people called it "Baitutai" (白土台, White Earth Terrace), describing "Baitutai" as "droughty Baitutai, no good people come up, the wind rises and fills the mountains with soil, heavy rain turns into disaster, kilns collapse and people lose their lives, and the four seasons are not peaceful." It is also said, "Selling water and vegetables during the day is difficult, living in broken kilns covered with felt at night, hunger, cold and disease break the heart, crying sadly all year round." After liberation, Baitutai ended its tragic fate and began a happy life under the leadership of the Party. Especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, the changes were even greater. People's communes were established, and 16 factories were built from scratch, and more than 1,800 housewives went to work. Turning the consuming Fulongping into the producing Fulongping. As the economic and cultural lives of the masses are organized, sanitation work is also changing rapidly and continuously leaping forward. In 1959, seven pests were eliminated, and seven nos were achieved (no rats, sparrows, flies, bedbugs, lice, mosquitoes, sandflies), and six cleans (streets, courtyards, indoors, kitchens, toilets, personal). In addition to cholera and smallpox, which have long been eradicated, malaria and current cases of syphilis have also been eliminated. Pertussis, influenza, measles, dysentery, typhoid fever, and epidemic typhus and other diseases have been controlled. In sanitation work, the principle of treating both the symptoms and the root cause, with the focus on treating the root cause, has also been implemented. In combination with production, the breeding grounds of flies have been thoroughly treated, which has not only improved sanitation but also promoted production. In 1959 alone, the treatment of fly breeding grounds in conjunction with manure accumulation increased income by more than 10,000 yuan. In 1959, 113 Red Cross health workers and 580 health workers were also trained. In addition, a group of factory health workers and nursery workers have been trained. It has already been achieved that every team has a health station, every factory has a health worker, and every courtyard has a health worker. A medical prevention and health network centered on hospitals has been established, and epidemic prevention stations and amateur health schools have been established. In order to facilitate patients and make medical and health work better serve production, medical personnel have basically been able to enter and exit farmland, factories, workshops, and residential courtyards to deliver medicine to treat diseases. Health care systems have also been established for female employees, effectively ensuring the physical health of female employees and improving labor productivity. For example, the attendance rate of the "May 1st" hemp rope factory in the first half of 1959 was 82%, while it rose to 98% in January and February this year. The output value is also constantly increasing. In short, Fulongping has achieved a great victory in the continuous leap forward in the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the seven pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases. The masses now praise Fulongping, which was called "Baitutai" before liberation, as:

"Chairman Mao is like the red sun, shining on thousands of households with long-lasting happiness, the people's commune is infinitely good, Fulongping has undergone great changes, filling broken kilns and building new houses, with bright windows and clean floors, and fragrant flowers, sweeping away diseases for a strong body, a happy and prosperous life."

Comrade members: Fulongping, a terrible place where "hunger, cold and disease broke the heart, and crying sadly all year round" before liberation, has now become a place where "diseases are swept away for a strong body, and life is happy and prosperous." In comparison, the former is hell and the latter is heaven. Why is the change so great and the difference so great? The first of thousands of reasons is the leadership of the Party, and the thousands of difficulties and hardships are not difficult if we rely on the masses. This is a truth that has been repeatedly confirmed in practice. The greatest victory achieved by Fulongping in the patriotic movement, especially the continuous leap forward in the patriotic health movement in the past two years, is the great victory of the general line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which calls for going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all revolutionary and construction undertakings. Any work, including medical and health work, must be under the absolute leadership of the Party in order to move from victory to victory and continue to achieve a great leap forward. Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in their reports that in 1960, a movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, eliminate major diseases, and change customs and habits throughout the country will be launched on a wider scale in the field of health. What a great call that is so encouraging. For me, a health worker, I feel even more the glory and arduousness of the task ahead and the Party's unlimited trust in us. In order to achieve this great task victoriously, I must make contributions with my greatest efforts in the medical and health work and in the mass health movement under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. We must widely and deeply publicize and conscientiously implement the policy of combining the health movement with the great leap forward in production, cultural revolution, and technological revolution. The movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, must be conscientiously implemented in medical and health work.

Comrade members, in this first spring of the 1960s, the victorious situation makes our country vigorous and thriving. Taking advantage of this great opportunity, we must conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought and transform ourselves under the great banner of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We must make more contributions to our country's socialist construction cause with greater efforts.

    疾病扫除身体壮　生活美满乐洋洋
    陈桂云委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理向全国人民代表大会二届二次会议所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。这两个报告用不可辩驳的事实把我国六亿五千万人民更大、更好、更全面继续跃进的巨画展现在我们前面，为我们指出了新的奋斗目标。听了报告之后，使我更加欢欣鼓舞，更加增加了信心和力量。我坚决表示在今后工作中一定要贯彻执行。
    陈叔通副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告我表示完全同意。从报告中可以看出，一年来，全国委员会在党和毛主席的正确领导下，作了许多工作，取得了很大成绩，对于巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线起了积极作用。
    各位委员，从上次会议到现在已经一年了，在此期间，由于全国各族人民在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，更高地举起了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约运动。从而在工业、农业、交通运输、科学技术、文化教育等方面实现了继续大跃进。在医药卫生工作方面同样的是一个持续跃进的局面。几十年来，我一直从事妇幼保健工作，从旧社会到新社会，我经历了一个翻天复地的巨大变化，感受异常深刻。解放前在兰州我用借来的钱盖了一个不到十间房子的所谓妇婴保健所，最多才有十九张病床。我是唯一的一个大夫。那时候反动政府虽然也有所谓卫生机构，但他们根本不过问妇婴保健事业，从来不关心群众疾苦。解放后，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，妇幼保健事业有了很大发展，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，发展更为迅速。目前，从全省范围来说，县县、社社都设立了妇幼保健机构，在解放前只有十九张病床的妇幼保健所，现在已经发展成一个具有二百张病床的妇产科医院。这个医院不仅解决了妇产科疑难病症，还在群众中广泛深入的宣传妇幼保健知识，并坚决贯彻党的预防为主的卫生工作方针：如充分发挥群众大搞除害灭病工作，今年元月至3月中旬即灭鼠二百九十六只，挖蛹一百一十一斤二两，捕蝇四千多只，清除垃圾一百五十吨，积肥一百三十三吨。在广泛卫生知识的宣传中，我院坚持了宣传领先，逢会插脚的办法，充分利用元旦、节日、星期天、义务劳动等机会，以化装表演、广播、快板、黑板报、传单、标语等形式，深入群众进行宣传教育，使群众认识到讲卫生的重要性。此外也进行了受市区领导的划区医疗工作，认真贯彻了扩大预防以医院为中心指导地方和厂矿的卫生防疫工作方针。为了使妇幼卫生工作进一步为工农生产服务，我院在省卫生行政会议后，则与四个专区、两个自治州、五个市医院挂钩，按需要抽调医护人员到甘南、武都、临洮引水工地、白银市等地进行巡回医疗工作。并接受助产士、保健员来院进修，及协助市妇幼保健院进行手术、会诊、接受难产转诊等。在妇产院成立后（1959年7月下旬）医疗质量也提高了，产科治疗率98.82％，妇科治疗率96.83％，早产儿成活率95％，足月儿成活率达到百分之百。在中西医结合方面，积极从事科学研究工作，用中西医结合治疗，达到90％以上，治疗效果良好：如慢性盆腔炎症是妇科中较顽固的疾病，过去用西药治疗，疗程长、效力低，我们自采取了中药结核乳没汤治疗慢性盆腔炎的专题研究，根据五十一例治疗效果观察，治疗率达到96％，好转二例，目前有六十多例尚在观察中。此外在面向生产一切为了病人，进一步改善了服务态度。在贯彻勤俭办院的方针，开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，如自制注射液、胎盘粉、收集人奶、收集胎盘血等在1至3月15日增产了二千三百三十元零七角四分。在节约方面，大量采用中医中药、针灸治疗及预防方法，在不影响医疗质量的原则下，降低贵重药品的消耗量。在抗旱生产方面：应甘肃省委的号召，全党全民总动员，开展抗旱生产运动后，在党支部的领导下，支部书记亲自挂帅，指挥作战，规定每星期五日为集体劳动日、组织生产突击队，干部轮流下放一个月进行生产劳动，院内除36％的职工长期在外工作或劳动外，在院内实有工作人员七十三人，除日常医护工作外，开荒土地八亩，翻地十五亩，浇水二十三亩，现已全部下种完毕，全院职工定以人定胜天的坚强意志，和冲天的革命干劲为战胜干旱保证完成和超额完成“百斤洋芋、百斤南瓜”的任务而奋斗。从上面小小成绩来看若不是党的正确领导，妇幼保健事业是难有如此巨大的变化。
    在这次来开会之前曾对兰州市城关区伏龙坪上的卫生情况进行了检查，现将他们的跃进情况作一介绍。大家知道我们国家是“一穷二白”，甘肃是更穷更白。兰州市城关区伏龙坪是在山上，解放前人们把它叫作“白土台”，形容“白土台”是“干旱白土台，好人不上来，风起满山土，雨大就成灾，窑塌人丧命，四季不安宁”。又云“白天挑水卖菜渡艰难，晚上住的破窑盖毡片，饥寒疾病苦断肠，一年四季哭凄惶”。解放后白土台结束了悲惨凄凉的命运，在党的领导下，开始了幸福的日子。尤其是在大跃进的1958年和1959年变化更大。成立了人民公社，白手起家建立了工厂十六个，一千八百多家庭妇女走向生产岗位。变消费的伏龙坪为生产的伏龙坪。由于群众的经济生活和文化生活组织起来了，因此，卫生工作也是日新月异不断跃进。在1959年就消灭了七害，达到了七无（无鼠、雀、蝇、臭虫、虱子、蚊、白蛉子）、六净（街巷、庭院、室内、厨房、厕所、个人）。除了霍乱、天花早已绝迹外又消灭了疟疾和现症梅毒。控制了百日咳、流感、麻疹、痢疾、伤寒、斑疹伤寒等疾病。在卫生工作中，还贯彻了本标兼治，治本为主的方针。结合生产，彻底治理了苍蝇孳生场所，既搞好了卫生，又促进了生产。仅在1959年结合积肥治理苍蝇孳生场所就增加收入一万余元。1959年还训练了红十字卫生员一百一十三名，卫生员五百八十名。此外还训练了一批工厂保健员和保育员。已经作到队队有卫生站，厂厂有保健员，院院有卫生员。并建立了以医院为中心的医疗预防保健网，成立了防疫站和卫生业余学校。为了便利病人，使医药卫生工作更好地为生产服务，目前已基本上做到医务人员出入农田、工厂、车间、居民院落、送药上门治疗疾病。对女职工还建立了保健制度，有效的保证了女职工的身体健康，提高了劳动生产率。例如“五一”麻绳厂1959年上半年出勤率为82％，今年1至2月则上升为98％。产值也不断提高，总之伏龙坪在大搞除七害、讲卫生、消灭疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动中取得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。在解放前称之为“白土台”的伏龙坪，现在群众赞颂为：
    “毛主席好比红太阳，照得千家万户幸福长，人民公社无限好，伏龙坪上大变样，填了破窑盖新房，窗明几净百花香，疾病扫除身体壮，生活美满乐洋洋”。
    各位委员：伏龙坪这样一个在解放前“饥寒疾病苦断肠，一年四季哭凄惶”可怕的境地，现在却变成了“疾病扫除身体壮，生活美满乐洋洋”的地方。对比起来，前者是地狱，后者是天堂。为什么变化如此巨大，差别如此悬殊？千条万条党的领导第一条，千难万难，依靠群众就不难，这是在实践中被一再证实了的真理。像伏龙坪在爱国运动中所取得的最大胜利，特别是近两年来在爱国卫生运动中的继续大跃进，这是党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的伟大胜利。党的领导是一切革命事业和建设事业取得胜利的根本保证。任何工作包括医药卫生工作在内，必须在党的绝对领导下，才能从胜利走向胜利，继续实现大跃进。李富春副总理和李先念副总理在报告中指出，在1960年，要在全国范围内，在卫生事业方面，将更加广泛地开展一个除四害讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的移风易俗，改造世界的运动。这是一个多么令人欢欣鼓舞的伟大号召。对我这个卫生工作者来说，更加感到今后任务的光荣、艰巨和党对我们的无限信任。为了胜利的实现这一伟大任务，我一定要在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在医药卫生工作中，在群众卫生运动中，尽自己最大的力量，做出贡献。要广泛深入的宣传和认真贯彻卫生运动与生产大跃进和文化革命、技术革命相结合的方针。把以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，在医药卫生工作中，认真贯彻执行。
    各位委员，在这六十年代的第一个春天里，胜利的形势，使我们国家朝气蓬勃，蒸蒸日上。乘此大好的时机，我们一定要在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大旗帜下面，认真学习毛泽东思想，改造自己。用更大的努力，为我国的社会主义建设事业作出更多贡献。
