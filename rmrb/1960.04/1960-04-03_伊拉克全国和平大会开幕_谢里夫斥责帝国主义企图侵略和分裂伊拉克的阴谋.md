　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 31st: The Third Iraqi National Peace Congress opened this afternoon in Baghdad.

　　Three hundred and twenty delegates from all provinces of the country and ninety-three members of the Iraqi National Peace Fighters Committee attended the meeting. Representatives from more than ten countries, including the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Ceylon, as well as the World Peace Council, were invited to attend the congress.

　　Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Peace Fighters Committee, addressed the congress on behalf of the National Committee. He said that the congress had two purposes: first, to expose and thwart the imperialist conspiracy against the Iraqi Republic; and second, to contribute to easing world tensions, especially to the success of the upcoming summit meeting.

　　Sharif pointed out the activities of the aggressive military bloc headed by the United States, as well as the serious dangers arising from the revival of West German militarism and France's criminal policies in Algeria. After analyzing the situation in the Middle East, Sharif pointed out that the imperialist countries had remobilized the reactionary forces in the countries of the region and adopted an offensive, making the Middle East one of the most dangerous regions, with the risk of war breaking out.

　　In his report, Sharif traced the recent aggressive activities of the Central Treaty Organization and certain Middle Eastern countries in collusion with reactionary forces within Iraq against Iraq. He emphasized that the imperialists are trying their best to divide the national ranks of Iraq in order to make their conspiracy succeed.

　　Sharif said that the imperialist agents are particularly focused on attacking the Iraqi peace movement because the peace movement is aimed at imperialism and its policies. He urged people to pay attention to the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the cooperation between newly independent countries in Asia and Africa and socialist countries. He said that this cooperation is the essence of a policy of active neutrality.

　　Sharif finally emphasized that the main way to defend the Iraqi Republic is the unity of patriotic forces.

　　Prime Minister Qasim also attended the opening ceremony of the congress and spoke.

    伊拉克全国和平大会开幕
    谢里夫斥责帝国主义企图侵略和分裂伊拉克的阴谋
　　据新华社巴格达3月31日电伊拉克第三届全国和平大会今天下午在巴格达开幕。
    参加会议的有来自全国各省的三百二十名代表和伊拉克和平战士全国委员会的九十三名委员。苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、突尼斯、黎巴嫩和锡兰等十多个国家以及世界和平理事会的代表应邀出席了大会。
      伊拉克和平战士全国委员会总书记阿齐兹·谢里夫代表全国委员会向大会致词。他说，代表大会有两个目的：一、揭露和挫败帝国主义反对伊拉克共和国的阴谋；二、为缓和世界紧张局势，特别是为使即将召开的最高级会议成功作出贡献。
    谢里夫指出了以美国为首的侵略性军事集团的活动，以及由于西德军国主义复活和法国在阿尔及利亚的罪恶政策而产生的严重危险。谢里夫分析了中东形势之后指出，帝国主义国家重新动员了这个地区各国的反动势力，采取攻势，使中东成为最危险的地区之一，使它有爆发战争的危险。
    谢里夫在报告中追述了最近中央条约组织以及某些中东国家和伊拉克国内的反动势力相勾结反对伊拉克的侵略活动。他强调说，帝国主义者正在竭力分裂伊拉克的民族队伍，以便使他们的阴谋得逞。
    谢里夫说，帝国主义代理人特别集中力量打击伊拉克的和平运动，因为和平运动是针对帝国主义及其政策的。他促请人们注意帝国主义破坏亚非两洲获得独立的国家和社会主义国家合作的阴谋。他说，这种合作是积极中立政策的实质。
    谢里夫最后强调指出，保卫伊拉克共和国的主要办法就是爱国力量的团结。
    卡塞姆总理也参加了大会的开幕式并且讲了话。
