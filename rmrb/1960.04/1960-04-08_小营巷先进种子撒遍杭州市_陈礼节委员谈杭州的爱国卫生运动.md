Xiaoying Lane Advanced Seeds Spread Throughout Hangzhou City
Committee Member Chen Lijie Discusses Hangzhou's Patriotic Health Campaign

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the draft 1960 national budget, and I agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

1959 was a year of continued great leap forward in our country's socialist construction. Our Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, like all brother cities across the country, under the wise leadership and profound concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the guidance and inspiration of the General Line, unremittingly and enthusiastically carried out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eradicating major diseases, winning new and significant victories.

Xiaoying Lane Reaches New Heights

Here, rats have been virtually eliminated, and flies and bedbugs are also hard to find. The habit of loving cleanliness and emphasizing hygiene has become a social norm, and it has become a reality to spend the summer and autumn without mosquito nets.

Xiaoying Lane is a residential area with more than 600 households in Hangzhou City, and it is the glorious place where our great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, personally inspected sanitation. For several years, they have persisted in the struggle to eliminate pests and diseases, and in 1959, their sanitation work reached a new level. Now, in this area, it has become a reality to spend the summer and autumn without mosquito nets. Rats have been virtually eliminated, and flies and bedbugs are also hard to find. Loving cleanliness and emphasizing hygiene have become the public norm, and every household has bright windows and clean rooms, with neat and clean surroundings. Civilian-run factories, residential canteens, and kindergartens all have mass health workers. Canteens have generally established a complete set of sanitary regulations for food inspection, utensil disinfection, separation of raw and cooked knives and drills, and handwashing by cooks before meals and after using the toilet. The ideal of people transforming the environment is gradually being realized in Xiaoying Lane. Last year, all residents enthusiastically participated in voluntary labor, removing four garbage mountains, filling in smelly ditches that bred mosquitoes and flies, and opening four small gardens such as Xiaoying Park, planting hundreds of varieties and nearly ten thousand flowers and trees, such as peach blossoms, osmanthus, peonies, and roses. Residents also widely participated in physical exercise, doing gymnastics and Tai Chi in the parks they built themselves every morning. Due to the great improvement in sanitary conditions and the continuous strengthening of physical fitness, infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, malaria, and dysentery, which were prevalent before liberation, have not occurred for more than five years. Now, every resident is full of energy and actively engaged in production, enthusiastically praising their new life: "Xiaoying Lane has a new look, every household emphasizes hygiene, sending away the plague gods and welcoming longevity stars, men, women, old and young are all smiles, Chairman Mao's instructions are like a bright lamp, the Party's kindness is deeper than the sea." This residential area has been gloriously rated as a national advanced sanitation area.

Learning from Xiaoying Lane Everywhere

The patriotic health campaign of learning from Xiaoying Lane and catching up with Xiaoying Lane has swept across Hangzhou. Currently, 340 residential areas are approaching or have reached the advanced level of Xiaoying Lane.

The residents of Xiaoying Lane have set a brilliant example for the people of the whole city. Over the past two years, a patriotic health campaign of "learning from Xiaoying Lane and catching up with Xiaoying Lane" has surged forward throughout the city. In the past, some people had the difficult idea that "the four pests cannot be eliminated" and dared not declare war on nature. During the campaign, due to the fact that the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels took the lead, went to the front line, grasped ideology, grasped planning, grasped inspection and evaluation, and grasped the summary of experiences, they vigorously promoted the campaign and created momentum. The broad masses of people have learned from practice the truth that "man will conquer nature," enhanced their courage to transform nature, and strengthened their confidence that "we will never give up until the four pests are eliminated," and their infinite wisdom and strength have been fully brought into play. Last spring, more than 600,000 people in the urban area were mobilized to launch a major offensive against mosquito and fly breeding grounds. In just two months, the four major city rivers, including Huansha River, Zhonghe River, Donghe River, and Shengtang River, were thoroughly dredged, and more than 45,000 square meters of river walls were caulked. All 228 stone slab open ditches in the five urban areas of the city, with a total length of more than 21,800 meters, were converted into underground sewers; 118 large and small sewage ponds were filled in, accumulating 500.619 million dan of fertilizer. Those ponds that could not be filled were also generally dredged and reorganized, and fish were raised. At the same time, measures such as hinged and filtered methods were adopted in light of local conditions to transform more than 50,000 manholes and septic tanks, so that the water flow was smooth and mosquitoes and flies could not fly in and out. Many places that were originally breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies were planted with trees and flowers, greening and beautifying the environment. In the summer and autumn seasons, the people of the city enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to "fight hard in August and September to achieve large-scale mosquito- and fly-free areas to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country." Wherever the Party pointed, the masses rushed there. Party and government leaders at all levels personally took the lead, and hundreds of thousands of people in urban and rural areas successively launched more than ten high tides of fierce mosquito and fly eradication campaigns, insisting on the system of hitting three times a day and salvaging egg masses everywhere. In the mountainous forest areas around the lake, a large-scale smoke warfare was carried out. Around the residential areas, deadly traps were set up, forming a trap network. Neighborhoods, with local health personnel and mass health backbones as the main force, formed specialized teams for eliminating the four pests, adopting the method of inspecting, processing, and mobilizing the masses at the same time, checking every household every day, and thoroughly investigating mosquito and fly breeding grounds. During the campaign, under the leadership of the Party, medical and health personnel conscientiously implemented the instruction to expand hospital prevention work, fully demonstrating their abilities. They went down to the streets and lived, ate, and worked with the masses, teaching health knowledge to the masses from house to house, and summarized and promoted comprehensive mosquito control measures such as filling, transforming, flushing, salvaging, caulking, raising, turning over, and sealing, as well as a complete set of effective methods and experiences for killing mosquitoes and flies, such as attracting eggs to kill mosquitoes, quickly killing flies, spraying livestock bodies with medicine, and eliminating chironomids and egg masses, giving mosquitoes and flies a fatal blow. The urban area achieved large-scale mosquito- and fly-free areas. According to inspections of more than 60,000 residents and units, 99.3% of households were free of mosquitoes, 99.2% were free of flies, and 93.6% were clean households. Since the beginning of winter, the broad masses of people have organized lean teams, not letting go of a crack or a dark corner, meticulously searching and capturing overwintering mosquitoes and flies, while braving the wind and snow and enduring the severe cold of minus six degrees, they have vigorously engaged in sanitation and fertilizer accumulation, and vigorously engaged in the fundamental work of eliminating the four pests, turning stagnant ponds into flowing ponds, changing open ditches into underground sewers, and improving cellars and wells. They said: "The water is cold but our hearts are not, we must eliminate pests to the root, destroy mosquito and fly nests, and benefit future generations." This spring, the pest elimination and disease control campaign was closely combined with urban construction and greening. In more than a month, men and women, old and young, worked together. More than 300,000 cadres, soldiers, workers, teachers, students, and street residents participated in the pest elimination and greening campaign, filling in two stinking rivers more than 2,500 meters long and more than 40 sewage ponds. Fruit trees were planted and flower beds were arranged on the filled land, which will soon become an orchard full of red flowers and fruits. The masses sang: "Thousands of troops and horses are going into battle together, and dead rivers and smelly ponds are leveled in the blink of an eye. Mosquito and fly breeding grounds are eliminated, and green trees and red flowers are blooming everywhere in spring." More than 2 million trees were planted on both sides of more than 200 small streets and alleys, and more than 400 small parks and green lawns were opened up. The Huansha River, which was thoroughly dredged last year, has red flowers and green leaves on both banks this year, and many streets and alleys are filled with large and small flower beds and green trees, fundamentally changing the dirty and backward appearance of sewage accumulation, garbage on the streets, and excrement flowing everywhere before liberation. With the deepening of the campaign, the sanitary knowledge level of the broad masses of people has been continuously improved, and it has become a conscious action for the masses to eliminate the four pests such as mosquitoes and flies as soon as they see them. Good personal hygiene habits such as using towels separately, disinfecting tableware, not spitting anywhere, and not littering fruit peels and paper scraps are gradually being cultivated. Many residents have also set up amateur hygiene schools. More than 1,700 Red Cross health stations have been established throughout the city, and more than 40,000 Red Cross health workers have been trained, forming a relatively complete health work network of hospitals, street joint health centers, and Red Cross health stations in residential areas. The incidence of diseases has been greatly reduced compared with the previous year. For example, the incidence of malaria has dropped to 0.1 per thousand, a decrease of 80%; the incidence of encephalitis B has dropped to 0.02 per thousand, a decrease of 66%. This spring, the incidence of various respiratory infectious diseases decreased by 69% to 99% compared with the same period last year. Now, the advanced seeds of Xiaoying Lane have blossomed everywhere in the city, and 340 residential areas are approaching or have reached the advanced level of Xiaoying Lane.

Changing Customs and Habits

Through the sanitation campaign, both the urban and rural landscapes have been changed, and the spiritual outlook of the people has also been changed. The atmosphere of "taking hygiene as glory and unhygienic as shame" has taken root in the minds of the masses.

Eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene is a great undertaking to change customs and habits and transform the world. Through several years of unremitting patriotic health campaigns, not only has the urban and rural environment of this city been greatly changed, but also the spiritual outlook of the people has undergone profound changes. The atmosphere of "taking hygiene as glory and unhygienic as shame" has taken root in the minds of the broad masses of people. In order to break through dead corners, many residents have developed the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, organized mutual aid groups or shock teams, and actively helped residents who lacked labor or whose whole families were participating in production to do sanitation. If one person does not abide by the public health system, everyone will come to persuade and help. The old concept of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door," which has remained in people's minds for many years, has collapsed. At the same time, in the pest elimination and sanitation campaign, tens of thousands of people worked tirelessly without remuneration. Collective units and residential areas are linked together for collaboration, large-scale joint prevention, and mutual assistance, which has become a common practice. The vigorous development of the sanitation campaign has greatly promoted production and enhanced the people's physical fitness. According to statistics from 23 factories such as Hangzhou Automobile Manufacturing Factory, the absenteeism rate of employees due to illness last year decreased by more than 30% compared with the previous year, creating more wealth for the country. In rural areas, many people who originally suffered from schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria have quickly recovered their health and put themselves into production through repeated treatment. Due to good sanitation, the Yudao Village of Jianqiao Commune, the Meijiawu Village of Xihu Commune, and the Litongwu Production Team of Shangsi Commune have not had any infectious diseases for many years, and even common sores and minor illnesses are rarely found in summer, and the labor attendance rate reaches 100%, and production is booming. The city has also accumulated more than 500.6 million dan of sanitary fertilizer in the pest elimination and sanitation campaign. Calculated at 500 dan per mu, it can solve the fertilizer needed for more than 1 million mu of rice fields. Therefore, the broad masses of people said: "There are countless benefits to eliminating pests and insects. Accumulating fertilizer, producing more grain, reducing diseases, strengthening the body, increasing field production, and prospering people and livestock."

Continue the Effort

Currently, the people of Hangzhou City are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party, vigorously promoting and creating momentum, and launching an unprecedented patriotic health campaign to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day.

The great achievements of the pest elimination and sanitation campaign in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, eloquently prove that: with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the correct guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, as long as we grasp the objective laws of eliminating diseases and pests, adopt the combat methods of combining surprise attacks and regular work, establish the revolutionary idea of eliminating pests, vigorously promote and create momentum, and under the leadership of the Party Committee, engage in the combination of leading cadres, the masses, and medical and health personnel, adhere to continuous revolution, the four pests and major diseases can be completely eliminated in a relatively short period of time. Hangzhou City is the glorious place where our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected sanitation, and it is also a world-famous garden city. Doing a good job in sanitation has greater political and international significance. Now the people of the whole city are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party, vigorously promoting and creating momentum. From the city to the countryside, a new upsurge of the patriotic health campaign on a larger scale than ever before has been set off. Whether old, young, youth, middle-aged, teachers, students, men, women, everyone is holding fly swatters and other tools, eliminating the four pests and engaging in sanitation, welcoming the "May Day" International Labor Day, and welcoming the National Spring Sanitation Inspection. The people of the whole city are determined to "learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, and surpass Foshan," and in a relatively short period of time, make a greater leap forward in the work of eliminating pests and diseases, promote the city's sanitation work to a new stage to meet the needs of urban construction and production development, and strive to realize the great task of eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eradicating major diseases proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, so that our city can be transformed into a new socialist Hangzhou with modern industry, modern science and culture, and a cleaner and more beautiful, healthy people as soon as possible.

Finally, I wish the conference a successful conclusion and all committee members good health.

    小营巷先进种子撒遍杭州市
    陈礼节委员谈杭州的爱国卫生运动主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并同意陈叔通副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    1959年是我国社会主义建设继续大跃进的一年。我们浙江省杭州市同全国各兄弟城市一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导和深切关怀下，在总路线的指引和鼓舞下，随着建设事业的全面大跃进和人民公社化运动的蓬勃发展，坚持不懈地轰轰烈烈地开展了以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，赢得了新的巨大的胜利。
    小营巷更上一层楼
    在这里，老鼠已基本绝迹，苍蝇、臭虫也难发现。爱清洁、讲卫生形成社会风尚，不挂蚊帐过夏秋也成为现实。
    小营巷是杭州市的一个拥有六百多户的居民区，是我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自查看过卫生的光荣地方。他们数年如一日，坚持除害灭病斗争，在1959年中卫生工作更上一层楼。现在，这个地区，不挂蚊帐过夏秋已经成为现实。老鼠已经基本绝迹，苍蝇、臭虫也难得发现。爱清洁、讲卫生已成为群众风尚，家家户户窗明几净，室内室外整齐清洁。民办工厂、居民食堂和幼儿园，都有群众卫生员。食堂普遍建立了食品三查、食具消毒、生熟刀钻分开和炊事员饭前便后洗手等个人卫生的一整套卫生制度。人们改造环境的理想，在小营巷正在逐步实现。去年全区居民热烈参加了义务劳动，搬走了四座垃圾山，填平了孳生蚊蝇的臭水沟，开辟了小营公园等四个小型花园，种植了桃花、桂花、牡丹、蔷薇等几百种、近万株的花木。居民还广泛参加了体育锻炼，每天早晨在他们自己动手兴建的公园里做体操打太极拳。由于卫生状况的大大改善和体质的不断增强，解放前严重流行的伤寒、疟疾、痢疾等传染病，已经五年多没有发生。现在个个居民精神饱满，积极生产，他们热情地歌颂自己的新生活：“小营巷里气象新，家家户户讲卫生，送走瘟神迎寿星，男女老少笑盈盈，毛主席指示像明灯，党的恩情比海深。”这个居民区，已光荣地被评为全国的卫生先进地区。
    处处学习小营巷
    学小营巷，赶小营巷的爱国卫生运动，在杭州风起云涌。目前，已有三百四十个居民区接近或达到小营巷的先进水平。
    小营巷居民已为全市人民树立了光辉的榜样。两年来一个“学小营巷，赶小营巷”的爱国卫生运动在全市风起云涌，滚滚向前。过去有些人存在着“四害灭不尽”的畏难思想，不敢向自然界开战。在运动中，由于各级党委书记挂帅，亲临前线，抓思想、抓规划、抓检查评比、抓总结经验，大张旗鼓，大造声势。广大群众从实践中认识了“人定胜天”的真理，增强了改造自然的勇气。坚定了“四害不除，决不罢休”的信心，无穷无尽的智慧和力量就充分地发挥出来。去年春天，城区发动了六十多万人，向蚊蝇巢穴大举进攻，在短短的两个月中，彻底疏浚了浣沙河、中河、东河和圣塘河等四大城河，河壁嵌缝四万五千多平方米；全市五个城区石板明沟二百二十八条，共长二万一千八百多米，均改为土下水道；填平大小污水塘一百一十八个，积肥五亿零六百一十九万担，不能填平的水塘，也普遍疏挖整理，并养了鱼；同时，因地制宜，采取活门式、过滤式的办法，改造了五万多个窨井窨缸，使流水畅通，使蚊子，苍蝇不能飞出飞进。很多原来是孳生蚊蝇的地方都种了树栽了花，绿化美化了环境。夏秋季，全市人民热烈响应市委提出的“大战8、9月，实现大面积无蚊无蝇地区，迎接伟大的建国十周年”的战斗号召。党指向那里，群众就奔向那里。各级党政领导亲自挂帅，城乡百余万群众，先后掀起了十次以上的猛剿蚊蝇的运动高潮。坚持一日三打制度，到处打捞卵块。在环湖山林地带，开展了大规模的烟海战。在居民点周围大摆诱杀阵，组成了诱杀网。街道以地段卫生人员和群众卫生骨干为主要力量，组成除四害专业队，采取边检查、边处理、边教育发动群众的办法，天天挨家挨户检查，把蚊蝇孳生地查深查透查彻底。在运动中医药卫生人员在党的领导下，认真贯彻了医院扩大预防工作的指示，充分显示了自己的能力，他们下街道和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，挨家挨户把卫生知识教给群众，并且总结推广了填、改、冲、捞、嵌、养、翻、封等灭蚊综合措施和诱卵杀蚊、快速灭蝇、畜体喷药以及消灭摇蚊和卵块等一整套杀灭蚊蝇的有效方法和经验，给蚊蝇以致命的打击。城区实现了大面积无蚊无蝇地区。据六万多居民户和单位的检查，无蚊户占99.3％，无蝇户占99.2％，整洁户也占93.6％。入冬以来，广大群众一面组织精干小组，不放过一缝一洞和阴暗角落，精雕细刻地搜捕越冬蚊蝇，一面顶风踏雪，冒着零下六度的严寒，大搞卫生积肥，大搞除四害治本工作，变死水塘为活水塘，改明沟为土下水道，改良窖缸窖井，他们说：“水冷心不冷，除害要除根，捣掉蚊蝇巢穴，造福子孙万代”。今年春天，除害灭病又和城市建设绿化运动紧密结合，在一个多月中，男女老少一齐动手，三十多万机关干部、部队官兵、工人、教员、学生和街道居民参加除四害和绿化运动，填平了二千五百多米长的两条臭水河和四十多个污水塘。在已填平的土地上种上了花果树，布置了花坛，不久将成为红花满树、果实累累的一片花果园，臭水塘都变成了公园绿地。群众歌颂道：“千军万马齐上阵，死河臭塘转眼平，灭尽蚊蝇孳生地，绿树红花遍地春。”在两百多条小街小巷两旁，种植树木二百多万株，还开辟了小公园、绿地草坪四百多处。去年经过彻底疏浚的浣沙河，今年两岸红花绿叶，许多街头巷尾布满了大大小小的小花坛和绿树。根本上改变了解放前污水淤积、垃圾满街、粪尿横流的肮脏落后面貌。随着运动的深入开展，广大人民群众的卫生知识水平不断提高，见蚊蝇等四害就灭，已经成为群众自觉的行动。毛巾分用，食具消毒，不随地吐痰，不乱抛果壳纸屑等良好的个人卫生习惯，正在逐步养成。不少居民还办起了业余卫生学校。全市建立了一千七百多个红十字卫生站，培训了红十字卫生员四万多人，形成了医院、街道联合卫生所和居民区红十字卫生站的一套比较完整的卫生工作网。疾病的发病率比前年已大大减少，如疟疾的发病率已下降到千分之零点一，下降了80％；乙型脑炎下降到千分之零点零二，下降了66％。今年春天，各种呼吸道传染病比去年同期下降了69％至99％。现在，小营巷的先进种子已经在全市遍地开花，已有三百四十个居民区接近或达到小营巷的先进水平。
    移风易俗
    通过卫生运动，既改变了城乡面貌，又改变了人们的精神面貌。“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的风气，已在群众思想上扎下了根。
    除四害、讲卫生，是移风易俗、改造世界的伟大事业。通过几年来坚持不懈的爱国卫生运动，不但本市城乡环境面貌大大改观，而且使人民的精神面貌起了深刻的变化。“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的风气，已经在广大群众的思想上扎下了根。为了突破死角，很多居民已发扬了共产主义大协作精神，组织了互助组或突击队，主动帮助缺少劳动力和全家都参加生产的居民户搞卫生，如果有一个人不遵守公共卫生制度，大家都会来劝说和帮助。多少年来留在人们思想意识中的“各人自扫门前雪”的旧观念，已经土崩瓦解。同时，在除四害讲卫生运动中，成千上万的人民群众劳动不计报酬，工作不怕艰苦。集体单位和居民区挂钩协作，大搞联防，互相帮助，蔚然成风。卫生运动的蓬勃发展，大大促进了生产，增强了人民体质。据杭州汽车制造厂等二十三个工厂的统计，去年职工因病缺勤率比前年下降了30％以上，为国家创造了更多财富。在农村中不少原来患血吸虫病、血丝虫病、钩虫病和疟疾的人，通过反复治疗，很多人很快恢复健康，投入了生产。笕桥公社的御道村、西湖公社的梅家坞和上泗公社的里桐坞等生产队，由于卫生搞得好，多年没有发生传染病，甚至在夏天连一般疮癤小病也极少发现，劳动出勤率达到百分之百，生产搞得轰轰烈烈。全市在除四害讲卫生运动中，还增积卫生肥五亿零六百多万担，以每亩五百担计算，可解决一百多万亩稻田所需的肥料。因此广大群众说：“除害灭虫好处多得数不清，积了肥，多打粮，少疾病，身体强，田增产，人畜旺。”
    再接再厉
    目前，杭州市人民正在热烈响应党的号召，大张旗鼓，大造声势，掀起了规模空前的爱国卫生运动，迎接“五一”劳动节。
    我们浙江省杭州市除四害讲卫生运动的巨大成果，雄辩地证明了：有中国共产党的英明领导，有战无不胜、攻无不克的毛泽东思想的正确指导，只要我们掌握消灭病害的客观规律，采取突击运动和经常工作相结合的斗争方法，树立除害务尽的革命思想，大张旗鼓，大造声势，在党委领导下大搞领导干部、群众和医药卫生人员三结合，坚持不断革命，四害和主要疾病是完全可以在一个较短的时期内达到彻底消灭的。杭州市是我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲临查看过卫生的光荣地方，又是世界闻名的花园城市，搞好卫生工作更有重大的政治意义和国际意义。现在全市人民正在热烈响应党的号召，大张旗鼓，大造声势，从城市到农村，已掀起了一个规模比以往任何一次更大的爱国卫生运动新高潮，无论老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教员、学生、男子、女子，人人手执蝇拍和其他工具，大除四害，大搞卫生，迎接“五一”国际劳动节，迎接全国春季卫生大检查。全市人民决心“学佛山、赶佛山，超佛山”，在较短时期内，使除害灭病工作来一个更大跃进，把本市卫生工作推向一个新阶段以适应城市建设和生产发展的需要，并力争提前实现全国农业发展纲要提出的除四害，讲卫生，消灭主要疾病的伟大任务。使我市尽快地改造成为具有现代工业、现代科学文化和更加清洁美丽，人人健康的社会主义的新杭州。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。
