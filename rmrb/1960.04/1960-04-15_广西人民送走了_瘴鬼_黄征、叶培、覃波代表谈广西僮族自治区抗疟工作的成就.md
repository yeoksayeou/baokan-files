In the old society, Guangxi was known as a land of miasma. For thousands of years, the broad masses of working people of all ethnic groups suffered deeply from malignant malaria. People sang such mountain songs:

	When late rice ripens, the plague demon comes,
	It harms people and damages wealth;
	Nine out of ten households are burdened,
	The sick groan on their beds in sorrow.

After liberation, especially in recent years, the sanitary conditions in Guangxi have undergone fundamental changes. Malaria has been controlled, everyone is full of vigor, and everyone is strong. The masses praise it like this:

	The red flag of liberation flutters, the mountain areas have changed;
	Thanks to the Communist Party, for thorough liberation;
	Overthrowing the three mountains, the masses see the sun;
	Production rises day by day, life gets better every day;
	Comprehensive Great Leap Forward, guarantees health and well-being.

Esteemed delegates:

We fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and we will resolutely implement them in our practical work. Now we will give the conference a brief report on the anti-malaria work in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a beautiful and rich place, located in the subtropical zone, with a mild climate and abundant products. But in the old society, Guangxi was known as a land of miasma, which made people feel afraid. The so-called "miasma" was actually malignant malaria. For thousands of years, the broad masses of working people suffered from this prevalent disease. The pain was indescribable, and countless lives of people of all ethnic groups were taken away. In Longzhou, it was popularly called "chicken ghost." In the Yulin area, there was such a folk song: "When late rice ripens, the plague demon comes, it harms people and damages wealth, nine out of ten households are burdened, the sick groan on their beds in sorrow." During the Kuomintang rule, the construction of the Qian-Gui Railway passed through a highly malaria-prevalent area, and many migrant workers died. Therefore, at that time, there was a saying that "one sleeper costs one life."

The disasters suffered by the broad masses of working people were, in the final analysis, caused by the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class, who did not care about the people's suffering. Therefore, as the reactionary ruling class was eliminated, the disasters that the people had suffered for a long time were also resolved.

After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi implemented the ethnic policy, carried out socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially under the glorious light of the General Line, achieving great victories in the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959 and the people's communes. The sanitary conditions in Guangxi have undergone fundamental changes, and the people have sent away the "chicken ghost" and "plague demon." According to the survey of four cities and twenty-two counties, by the end of 1959, one city and eight counties had reduced the incidence of malaria to less than one in ten thousand, and three cities and fourteen counties had reduced it to less than one in one thousand. Among the 1,775 production brigades in the Yulin area, 1,412 brigades did not have a single case of malaria last year. The number of malaria-free brigades accounted for 75.3% of the total number of production brigades. In the railway construction for several consecutive years throughout the region, in the huge water conservancy construction sites, and in the mass campaign for steel production, malaria did not prevail on construction sites with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. Even during peak seasons of epidemic, very few cases of malaria were found. Because of the widespread and in-depth prevention and control work, malaria has been controlled throughout the region. As a result, a new atmosphere has emerged in the vast rural areas, where everyone is full of vigor, everyone is strong, the labor attendance rate has greatly increased, and production has risen steadily. The masses praise it like this: "The red flag of liberation flutters, the mountain areas have changed; Thanks to the Communist Party, for thorough liberation; Overthrowing the three mountains, the masses see the sun; Production rises day by day, life gets better every day; Comprehensive Great Leap Forward, guarantees health and well-being."

Our fight against malaria is based on comprehensive prevention and control measures with the elimination of the source of infection as the main focus, including: (1) Systematic and thorough treatment of newly infected patients, implementing the principle of early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment. Training a large number of grassroots anti-malaria personnel, organizing medical forces (mainly traditional Chinese medicine), assigning areas and responsibilities, taking charge of epidemic reporting, diagnosing patients, taking blood samples to examine spleen swelling, delivering medicine for treatment, and tracking observation. This can prevent missed investigations and missed treatments, and provide a reliable guarantee for the implementation of full-course treatment, systematic treatment, and thorough treatment. (2) Carrying out a general survey of malaria history, combined with key blood and spleen examinations, to carry out multiple and comprehensive anti-relapse treatments. (3) Strictly implementing a system of registration and inspection for incoming populations, treating those who are sick and preventing those who are not. (4) Conducting preventive medication for healthy people, and conducting preventive medication for residents in water conservancy construction sites, mountain areas, and other places before the emergence of epidemic peaks to control new infections. (5) Combining with the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating pests and diseases, vigorously killing mosquitoes and preventing mosquitoes, eliminating the vectors of malaria transmission, and cutting off its transmission routes. Practice has proved that by using such prevention and control methods, we can completely eliminate malaria more quickly.

The reason why we have been able to achieve such great achievements in anti-malaria work is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and the great magic power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; at the same time, it is also the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Because we have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the Party committees at all levels personally taking charge, unifying and arranging the work of eliminating pests and diseases with production, fully mobilizing the masses, and constantly summarizing and promoting experience in practice, we have adopted comprehensive prevention and control measures with the elimination of the source of infection as the main focus. Therefore, in a short period of time, unprecedented and huge achievements have been obtained. However, when the Party first proposed to eliminate malaria, a few people doubted whether malaria could be eliminated. Through several years of practice, it has vividly proved that as long as there is the leadership of the Party, not only can malaria be completely eliminated, but also all other diseases that seriously endanger people's health can be eliminated. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for our invincibility in our work.

Under the leadership of the Party, the political command of all health workers is also an important factor in our achievements. Because the health workers have established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people, clarified that business must obey politics and serve politics, so they can be inspired by the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, giving full play to their soaring drive, working selflessly, going to the mountains and down to the factories, rain or shine, day and night, going deep into the fields, delivering medical treatment to the door, and delivering medicine to the mouth, all for the sake of patients, trying every means to find patients, conducting registration and treatment, treating those who are sick and preventing those who are not, so that health work is closely integrated with production and serves production.

Resolutely following the mass line is also an important key to our victory in our work. Malaria has been harming the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, and eliminating malaria has become the urgent demand of the broad masses. When the Party put forward the call to eliminate malaria, a mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases surged up, wave after wave, unstoppable. Some people believe that "the masses are unwilling to engage in eliminating pests and diseases," and "the masses can eliminate pests, but they cannot eliminate diseases." This is because they have not seen the urgent demands of the masses to eliminate pests and diseases, do not believe in the masses, and think that the masses are ignorant. This is a manifestation of a lack of mass viewpoint. In 1958, because we relied on the masses to promote a general survey of malaria history and mass anti-relapse treatment, we suddenly forced the incidence of malaria to drop to nearly eliminated in a short period of time. This is a typical example of relying on the masses, believing in the masses, and taking the mass line to achieve victory. The work of eliminating pests and diseases is a mass movement and also a technical work. In carrying out the mass movement, technical guidance must be closely combined with the mass movement, and technology must be handed over to the masses to master, so that the enthusiasm of the masses can be fully utilized, and technology can be fully promoted, so as to achieve the three-way combination of leadership, masses, and technical personnel, and exert unparalleled powerful forces. In the mass movement, we must also constantly summarize the experience of the masses, sort it out, improve it, and use it to enrich our existing science and technology, so that the mass movement can continue to develop.

1960 is a year of continued Great Leap Forward. We must continue to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, set high ambitions, establish lofty aspirations, boost our efforts again and again, strive for the top again and again, and on the basis of the victories we have already achieved, continue our efforts, continue to revolutionize, promote the work of eliminating pests and diseases from point to area, continuously improve quality, and make more and more outstanding achievements. Strive to complete the tasks of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program well ahead of schedule, and strive to better support industrial and agricultural production with health work.

Finally, I wish the delegates good health.

    广西人民送走了“瘴鬼”
    黄征、叶培、覃波代表谈广西僮族自治区抗疟工作的成就
    旧社会把广西称为瘴气之地。千百年来，各族广大劳动人民深受恶性疟疾之害。人们唱着这样的山歌：
        晚稻黄熟瘴鬼来，不损人丁也损财；
        十户人家九被累，病人床上声哀哀。
    解放后，特别是近几年，广西卫生面貌发生了根本变化，疟疾被控制了，人人精神焕发，个个身强力壮。群众这样歌颂着：
  解放红旗飘，山区变了样；多亏共产党，彻底来解放；推倒三座山，群众见太阳；生产日日高，生活天天强；
  全面大跃进，无病保健康。各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理所作的报告，并在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我们将广西僮族自治区的抗疟工作向大会作一简要的汇报。
    广西僮族自治区是美丽富饶的地方，地处亚热带，气候温和，物产丰富。但旧社会则把广西称为瘴气之地，令人感到可怕。所谓“瘴气”，实际上就是恶性疟疾。千百年来，广大劳动人民给这种流行的疾病所侵害，痛苦是说不尽的，更不知夺去了各族人民多少生命。龙州民间称之为“鸡鬼”。玉林地区流传这样一首山歌：“晚稻黄熟瘴鬼来，不损人丁也损财，十户人家九被累，病人床上声哀哀。”在国民党统治时代，修建黔桂铁路，路线是经过疟疾高度流行地区，民工死亡很多，所以当时有“一条枕木一条命”的话。
    广大劳动人民所受的这种灾难，归根到底，都是由于反动的统治阶级剥削和压迫人民，不关心人民疾苦所造成的。因此，随着反动统治阶级被消灭，长期以来人民所受到的这种灾难也得到了解脱。
    解放后，广西各族人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，贯彻执行民族政策，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，特别是在总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了1958年和1959年连续大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利以后，广西的卫生面貌发生了根本变化，人民送走了“鸡鬼”、“瘴鬼”，根据四市二十二个县的调查，到1959年底，疟疾发病率已下降到万分之一以下的有一个市八个县，下降到千分之一以下的有三个市十四个县。玉林专区一千七百七十五个生产大队中有一千四百一十二个大队，去年全年没有发生一例疟疾病人，无疟大队占生产大队总数的75.3％。在全区连续几年修铁路，在巨大水利工地，在全民大办钢铁工地，几万几十万人的工地上，都没有流行过疟疾，并且经历了流行高峰季节，极少发现疟疾病人。由于防治工作广泛深入，在全区范围内，疟疾被控制住了，于是，广大农村出现了人人精神焕发，个个身强力壮，劳动出勤率大大增加，生产步步高涨的新气象。群众是这样歌诵着：“解放红旗飘，山区变了样；多亏共产党，彻底来解放；推倒三座山，群众见太阳；生产日日高，生活天天强；全面大跃进，无病保健康。”
    我们对疟疾作斗争，是采取以消灭传染源为主的综合性防治措施的，包括：（一）系统彻底的治疗新感染病人，贯彻早发现，早诊断，早治疗的方针。训练大批基层抗疟人员，组织医疗力量（主要是中医），分片包干，负责疫情报告，诊断病人，取血检脾肿，送药治疗，追踪观察，这样就可以防止漏查、漏治，并为贯彻全程治疗，系统治疗与彻底治疗提供可靠的保证。（二）开展疟史普查，结合重点血脾检查，进行多次的、全面的抗复发治疗。（三）对外来人口严格执行登记、检查，有病治病，无病防病的制度。（四）进行健康人预防服药，对水利工地、山区等地居民在流行高峰出现前进行预防服药，控制新感染。（五）结合以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动，大力灭蚊防蚊，消灭疟疾的传染媒介，切断其传染途径。实践证明，运用这样的防治方法，我们完全可以将疟疾加速消灭。
    我们能够在抗疟工作中取得这样巨大的成就，主要是由于党的正确领导，社会主义制度的无比优越性和总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的大显神通；同时又是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。由于我们有了党和毛主席的英明领导，在各级党委亲自挂帅，把除害灭病工作与生产统一安排布置，充分发动群众，在实践中不断总结经验与推广经验，采取了以消灭传染源为主的综合性防治措施，因而在短短的时间内，就获得了空前未有的巨大成绩。但是党刚提出要消灭疟疾的时候，有少数人曾经怀疑疟疾能否消灭。通过了几年的实践，生动地证明，只要有党的领导，不单是疟疾完全可以消灭，就是所有其他危害人民健康较严重的疾病，也是可以消灭的，党的领导是我们工作中无往而不胜的根本保证。
    在党的领导下，全体卫生工作人员政治挂帅，也是我们取得成绩的重要因素。由于卫生工作人员确立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，明确业务必须服从政治，为政治服务，所以能够在鼓足干劲、力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，发挥了冲天的干劲，忘我地劳动，上山下厂，风雨无阻，不分昼夜，深入田间，送医上门，送药到口，一切为了病人，千方百计的去发现病人，进行登记治疗，有病治病，无病防病，使卫生工作密切结合生产，为生产服务。
    坚决走群众路线，也是我们在工作中取得胜利的重要关键。疟疾一直在危害着我们广西各族人民，消灭疟疾已成为广大群众的迫切要求，当党提出了消灭疟疾的号召，一个除害灭病的群众性运动就风起云涌，波涛澎湃地掀了起来，一个高潮接一个高潮，势不可挡。有人认为“群众不愿意搞除害灭病”，“群众搞除害还可以，搞灭病就不可能”，这是没有看到群众的除害灭病的迫切要求，不相信群众，以为群众愚昧无知，这是缺乏群众观点的表现。1958年我们因为依靠了群众，推行普查疟疾史和群众性的抗复发治疗，便在短短的时间内，把疟疾的发病率，骤然迫使下降到将近消灭的程度，这就是依靠群众，相信群众，走好群众路线取得胜利的典型范例。除害灭病工作是群众运动，又是技术工作，在开展群众运动中，必须使技术指导与群众运动密切结合起来，把技术交给群众掌握，群众的积极性就可以高度发挥，技术亦可充分得到推广，作到领导、群众、技术人员三结合，发挥出无比强大的力量。在群众运动中，还须不断总结群众的经验，加以整理提高，用来丰富我们现有的科学技术，使群众运动不断往前发展。
    1960年，是继续大跃进的一年。我们要继续高举毛泽东思想红旗，树雄心，立壮志，干劲一鼓再鼓，上游一争再争，在已经取得胜利的基础上，再接再厉，不断革命，把除害灭病工作，由点推广到面，不断提高质量，作出更多、更出色的成绩来。为争取大大提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务，为把卫生工作更好地支援工农业生产而奋斗。
    最后祝代表们身体健康。
