Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the report by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will implement them in my practical work. Now I will report to the conference on the technical innovation movement in Anhui Province.

    The Technical Innovation Movement Deepens Step by Step

As early as 1955, Chairman Mao clearly instructed: "China can only completely transform its social and economic outlook by thoroughly completing the socialist transformation in social and economic systems, and by using machines in all departments and places where machine operation is possible." ("On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation") Chairman Mao's instruction profoundly and concisely pointed out the great significance of technological transformation and put forward a glorious historical task for us. The technical innovation movement in Anhui was launched under Chairman Mao's call.

Anhui was originally an area prone to disasters. The original level of industrial and agricultural production was not high. To change Anhui's backward situation of being "poorer and blanker" as soon as possible, we, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the one hand, after completing the land reform, carried out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce through a series of steps. The people's commune was realized in the rural areas, so that the relations of production adapted to the needs of the continuous development of productive forces; on the other hand, we carried out technical transformation of various departments of industrial and agricultural production, and extensively and deeply carried out the technical innovation movement, constantly carrying out reforms from tools, technological processes, and production management, improving labor efficiency, and promoting the overall and rapid development of the entire national economy.

As early as 1950, due to the needs of water management, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee proposed the requirement to reform water management tools, and began to reform various soil digging and soil transportation tools. Starting in 1953, our province promoted three reforms in agricultural production and carried out corresponding tool reforms according to needs. However, these reforms have not been able to form a mass movement and are only the sprouts of technical innovation. Technical innovation truly became a movement after understanding the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions. Especially in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor, the Provincial Party Committee, according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, proposed to vigorously carry out technical innovation, make one person equal to two, improve labor efficiency, and achieve increased production without increasing people or even increasing production while reducing people. The people of the province responded to this call and extensively launched a technical innovation movement. The scale, content, and effect of the movement were unprecedented. From cities to rural areas, from industrial and agricultural production to transportation, finance, trade, culture, education, and the elimination of the four pests, all work was carried out vigorously. The innovation formed a situation of "innovating everywhere, innovating in everything, and innovating by everyone."

In the past few years, due to the early and tight grasp of technical innovation and the fast and widespread promotion of new technologies, the effect has been remarkable. The concentrated manifestation of these effects is the rapid development of production and the large-scale saving of labor. From the agricultural front, from January last year to March this year, the province promoted the use of more than 47 million new and improved farm tools, which greatly improved labor efficiency, reduced labor intensity, saved labor, and ensured a continuous Great Leap Forward. In the past year alone, our province saved 2 billion labor days, accounting for 27% of the original planned 7.4 billion labor days. The effect of the technical innovation movement on water management construction sites is particularly prominent. Water management construction sites are wide and scattered, and it is more difficult to carry out technical innovation than in cities. When the Huai River was first managed in 1950, the average work efficiency per person per day was only 0.9 cubic meters, and it only increased to more than 1 cubic meter by 1957. Starting in the winter of 1957, tool reforms were carried out in a planned way on water conservancy construction sites throughout the province, and work efficiency increased to 3.8 cubic meters. Last winter and this spring, water conservancy construction sites vigorously carried out technical innovation movements with the spirit of continuous revolution, and the daily work efficiency per person jumped to about 13 cubic meters. Now, improved tools and semi-mechanized tools have been widely used in various processes such as digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting on water conservancy construction sites throughout the province, and they have been matched into a complete set. Various places have also broken the idea of dedicated machines and generally used drainage and irrigation machinery to drive water management tools, giving play to the effect of comprehensive utilization. The use of machinery on the entire water conservancy construction site has reached more than 30,000 horsepower, making a big step towards mechanization of water conservancy tools. Due to the widespread development of the technical innovation movement, the original plan of an average of 7.5 million people working every day last winter was reduced to 5 million people, saving more than 2.5 million people. As of mid-March, the province had completed 5.58 billion cubic meters of water conservancy earthwork, exceeding the original plan by 71.2%. Due to the large-scale saving of labor, not only was the water conservancy task overfulfilled, but also the overall development of various agricultural productions was ensured. Last winter and this spring, the province reclaimed more than 6 million mu of wasteland. Field management, short-distance transportation, and sideline production were also better than last year. Now, the technical innovation movement centered on tool reform on the agricultural front in our province is in full swing and has developed to the extensive use of natural energy sources such as water power, wind power, and biogas. Since this year, more than 500 wind turbines, more than 3,400 wind-powered waterwheels, and more than 900 hydropower stations have been installed. More than 1,830 canteens in the province have been using biogas as fuel all year round, and more than 90,000 farmers often use biogas for lighting. Small biogas power stations and biogas processing stations have developed to more than 200 places. Looking at the industrial transportation sector, from January last year to February this year, the vast number of employees in the province put forward a total of more than 1.35 million technical innovation proposals, of which more than 540,000 have been realized, which has vigorously promoted the development of various production and construction undertakings. Last year, 1,221 new and expanded projects were built in the province's industrial and transportation sectors, and the total output value increased by 55%, but the labor force used was more than 360,000 people less than in 1958. From January to March this year, with the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement, factory and mining enterprises in the province saved more than 90,000 people, and more than 60,000 people have been transferred to support new enterprises, realizing the requirements of increasing production without increasing people and increasing production while reducing people. In the industrial technical innovation movement, our province has particularly focused on the technical transformation of iron smelting "small foreign groups." In this regard, we have always grasped the three requirements of improving utilization coefficient, reducing coke ratio, and improving work efficiency. After the technical transformation of small blast furnaces in the province, various technical and economic indicators have been rapidly improved. In January this year, the average iron output per cubic meter of volume per day and night increased by 163.1% compared with January last year; the coke consumption per ton of iron decreased by 93.7% compared with January last year, and the qualified rate of pig iron reached more than 90%. After the technical transformation of more than 50 small blast furnaces in the Wuhu area, the average iron output per cubic meter of volume per day and night increased by 166.6% compared with January last year, and the qualified rate of iron reached 99%, achieving a large-scale harvest. The employees of the Red Flag No. 2 eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company carried forward the communist style, boldly broke with convention, increased the air volume and air temperature, greatly improved the utilization coefficient. In December last year, the average iron output per cubic meter of volume per day and night of this small blast furnace increased by 3.78 times compared with the original design capacity, creating the latest record of the utilization coefficient in our province. At the same time, our province has also carried out technical innovation and experiments in steelmaking and smelting various high-grade alloy steels, and has achieved remarkable results. At present, it can use local materials to self-smelt several kinds of alloy steels to meet the needs of certain manufacturing equipment. The results of use are very good and meet the standards. In terms of transportation, we have also carried out comprehensive innovations in loading, transportation, and unloading, fully tapping the transportation potential and improving transportation efficiency. The main stations and wharfs in the province generally use mechanized and semi-mechanized tools to replace manual operation, which greatly improves work efficiency, shortens loading and unloading time, and accelerates the turnover of vehicles and ships. The time for vehicles to stay at the station is shortened by one-half to three-quarters compared with the past. In the second half of last year, various places in our province also built more than 80 kilometers of simple railways through self-reliance. The construction of these simple railways not only played a major role in increasing transportation capacity and saving labor, but also accumulated experience, laying a good foundation for our province to vigorously develop simple railways in the future.

At present, the technical innovation movement in our province has entered a new stage, the scope of innovation is constantly expanding, and the content of innovation is constantly improving; from single innovation to the innovation of the entire production line, it has developed into a dragon in many aspects; from point innovation to surface innovation, from unbalanced development to balance; tools have developed from wooden to iron; from improved tools to semi-mechanization and mechanization, from manual operation to semi-automation and automation. Now the movement is developing rapidly with a surging momentum. We are seizing the current favorable situation to carry out the technical innovation movement more deeply, and strive to complete the task of comprehensively transforming the social and economic outlook of our province ahead of schedule.

    Several Key Issues

According to the instructions of the Central Committee and past experience, we have realized that to do a good job in the technical innovation movement, the following key issues must be resolved:

First, the combination of leadership and the masses

Leading cadres must personally grasp and seriously grasp it. Only in this way can the masses be motivated and organized. There are three main ways for leading cadres to grasp technical innovation: First, leading cadres personally do it, cultivate key points, and guide the overall situation; second, the masses put forward suggestions, technicians review them, leading cadres make choices, and then organize forces to conduct research, and then promote them after successful testing; third, leaders put forward topics, everyone writes articles, and then summarizes and improves. This method can not only give play to the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses to innovate technology, but also solve many major problems that production personnel and technical personnel cannot solve on their own. For example, in our water management tool reform movement, from the Provincial Party Committee to the Commune Party Committee, the first secretaries personally took charge and often worked with workers, peasants, and technicians to study and solve problems in technical innovation, ensuring the rapid improvement of water management efficiency. Another example is in the process of creating rice transplanters, the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee personally worked with farmers, workers, and technicians with production experience. After a long period of repeated research, they finally made a rice transplanter that transplants quickly, stably, is easy to pull, and divides seedlings evenly, solving the problems of uneven seedling division and some floating seedlings in the past. Another example is that in the earth method of coking in the Huainan Coking Plant, there were problems such as low output and quality, long coking time, and high labor intensity. According to this situation, the leadership put forward the topic of reforming the kiln shape. The workers responded to the call and carried out the test of eight kiln shapes successively. In the process of the test, the branch secretary and the factory director followed the shift, and the kiln master, bricklayer, and technicians jointly studied the reasons for the failure and looked for solutions. Finally, the "Huaiyi Type" coking kiln was successfully reformed, saving 50% of the labor force and greatly reducing the labor intensity. In the future, in the large-scale technical innovation movement, we will still resolutely implement the method of combining leadership and the masses.

Second, the combination of local and foreign methods

Starting from the actual situation, use foreign methods if possible, and use local methods if foreign methods are not possible, and closely combine local and foreign methods. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, achieve self-reliance, and continuously promote the technical innovation movement. The technical innovation in our province is mainly carried out by the method of combining local and foreign methods. For example, the Hefei Zhengfa Iron and Steel Plant resolutely implemented the principle of self-reliance. When transforming the cold and hot air pipelines, they used waste materials and scraps to weld and piece together without steel plates. When transforming the gas pipelines, they used bricks and cement to build pipelines instead of steel pipes, and quickly completed a series of technical transformation tasks for small blast furnaces, thereby promoting the increase in output. Of course, whether it is a local method or a foreign method, it must be continuously developed and continuously improved. Upholding both local and foreign methods, and upholding both large, medium and small sizes, is a principle that must be followed, whether it is at present or in the future. The iron and steel "small foreign groups" developed in our province during the large-scale steel-making movement in 1958 have played a great advantage after a series of technical transformations. Later, this experience was continued to be promoted to coking, mining, coal, chemical industry and other fields, and all have received the effect of more, faster, better and more economical. Therefore, in the process of technical innovation, it is necessary to grasp the large and foreign, but also to grasp the small and local; it is necessary to grasp the reform of manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization, but also to grasp the reform of semi-mechanization to mechanization and mechanization to automation; it is necessary to grasp the manufacture of new equipment, but also to grasp the transformation of existing equipment. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and carry out the technical innovation movement quickly and well.

Third, the combination of points and surfaces

In the technical innovation movement, we adopted the method of setting up points at all levels and setting up points in everything. Because there are many points set up, it is easy to concentrate the wisdom of the masses from all aspects and absorb experience suitable for various different conditions; because there are many points, it is easy to quickly and widely promote them after successful testing. In the process of implementing the combination of points and surfaces, it is required that leading cadres at all levels personally grasp the points and ensure that every technical innovation project is practical and reliable; and after a certain technical innovation project is truly successful, various methods such as on-site meetings, visits, exhibitions, and performances are immediately taken to vigorously organize promotion. In the process of promotion and use, it is constantly improved according to the experience of the masses in practice. Therefore, the combination of points and surfaces is also the combination of experimentation and promotion, and the combination of popularization and improvement. For example, the woodworking factory of the Third Engineering Office of Ma'anshan Construction and Installation Company adopted the method of mass appraisal for technical innovation projects, convened a joint appraisal meeting of workers from this factory and outside factories, and in the appraisal process, it absorbed advanced experience from other factories to enrich, improve, and improve. In this way, it played the role of experimentation and promotion, and played the role of popularization and improvement. For example, the soil transport pulley for water management, when it was first promoted in the winter of 1957, was cranked by hand, and the loading and unloading were done manually; in the process of promotion and use, the masses constantly improved it, first developing it into a dustpan-type soil transporter, which could automatically load and unload; later, it was further changed to gear loading and unloading, and it could also turn ridges and cross dams; in the water management movement last winter, it was changed to a power-driven soil transport pulley, and the work efficiency was more than ten times higher than before, and dozens of times higher than manual carrying. Many similar examples fully illustrate that technical innovation is endless, and people's wisdom is inexhaustible. Popularization, improvement, re-popularization, and re-improvement, such an infinite cycle will make the technical innovation movement continue to develop forward. In technical innovation, it is also necessary to grasp the key points and put the main force in the links and departments where a lot of labor is spent, the labor intensity is high, and the seasonality is strong, such as water management, transportation, mining, sowing, harvesting, processing, pig raising equipment, and manual labor in factories and mines. The requirements for technical innovation in these places are the most urgent, the potential is the greatest, and the most labor can be saved. Grasping these links and departments at present can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Fourth, the combination of scientific research and manufacturing

The development and improvement of the technical innovation movement are closely related to advanced science and technology. Since 1959, the scientific and technological undertakings in our province have been further developed. Now, scientific research institutions have been generally established from the province to the county, from factories and mines to people's communes; many agricultural middle schools have also earnestly implemented the policy of combining teaching, production, and scientific research, becoming the base for agricultural scientific research in people's communes; many production teams also pay attention to scientific research; mass scientific and technological organizations have spread throughout the vast urban and rural areas. In order to make scientific research closely serve production, we have implemented the principle of combining scientific research and manufacturing. On the one hand, we actively lead scientific research institutions and scientific and technological personnel of various factories, mines, and schools to go deep into the masses, deep into production practice, and combine with the masses according to the needs of production to innovate technology, make and improve production tools, and regard the process of scientific research as the process of making and improving production tools. On the other hand, we lead and organize various production departments to vigorously conduct scientific research, arming everyone with advanced scientific and technological knowledge, so that wherever there is production activity, there is scientific research activity, so that the reform of production tools and the improvement of production technology are guided by advanced science and technology, and the process of carrying out technical innovation is regarded as the process of scientific research. Because scientific research is closely combined with production, and professional scientific personnel are closely combined with the broad masses, the development of the technical innovation movement has been greatly promoted. For example, the solution of many technical problems in the small foreign groups of industrial production, the realization of semi-mechanization and semi-automation of biogas utilization, and the creation of some relatively advanced agricultural machinery such as wind turbines, rice transplanters, and rope traction machines are all under the unified leadership of the Party, through the joint efforts of professional scientific workers and production experts who have emerged from the masses, research and manufacturing have been carried out simultaneously to achieve achievements. We will continue to adhere to this policy in the future to promote the further development of the technical innovation movement.

Fifth, it is necessary to carry forward the tenacious spirit of persevering to the end

No matter what you do, you must have a spirit of enthusiasm, and technical innovation is the same. Only by breaking superstitions, liberating ideas, and daring to think and act can technical innovation be carried out and persisted in. The growth of any new thing, and any new invention and creation, always has to go through twists and turns. It will not only encounter the resistance of conservative ideas, but also encounter the difficulties of insufficient experience and insufficient material conditions. The problem lies in persistence. First, you must be able to withstand the evil wind of right-leaning conservative thoughts, and second, you must be good at summing up lessons and experience, and continue to experiment tenaciously. Each victory over a difficult hurdle is a step closer to final success, and if you slacken your efforts in one link, you will give up halfway, or even fall short. Not only should you persist in the process of experimentation, but also in the process of promotion and use, because any new technology is always from imperfect to perfect, from unskilled to skilled, and from unaccustomed to accustomed in the process of use. If you do not persist, even very good new technology may not be promoted. Our province proved this in the process of experimenting and promoting the use of biogas. As early as 1957, the Provincial Party Committee called for the development of biogasification. At that time, many places conducted experiments. In the experiments, most areas interrupted because they failed to break through the technical barrier. Only the cadres and masses of Fuyang County, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, persisted in the experiment. They ignored people's sarcasm and kept working after failures. After two years of persistence, they finally solved the problems of biogas pool leakage, biogas wintering, storage, and transportation under the condition of insufficient material conditions, and realized biogasification, setting an example for the promotion of biogas in the province. There are many similar examples in various regions and on various fronts. It tells us that giving play to the tenacious spirit of persistence is an important key to doing a good job in technical innovation.

Finally, adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental driving force for promoting the healthy development of the technical innovation movement.

The vigorously developing technical innovation movement is a result of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, and the process of technical innovation is still a process of ideological revolution. In the technical innovation movement, there is not only a struggle between advanced and backward, innovation and conservatism, but also a struggle between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology. Therefore, we must conscientiously do a good job in political and ideological work, and deeply publicize and implement the Party's general line, and arm the broad masses of cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The reason why we have been able to make relatively remarkable achievements in technical innovation is precisely the result of adhering to putting politics in command. The victory of technical innovation is the victory of the Party's general line, and it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought! The importance of putting politics in command for technical innovation can be seen very clearly from the facts of the Hefei Knitting and Wool Spinning Factory. In the past, some leading cadres in this factory had the idea of "the theory of conditions." When considering problems, they always put the difficulties in front. Technical innovation was carried out for half a year, and it was still in the experimental stage. After the rectification movement of anti-rightist and drumming up enthusiasm, under the help of the Party, they overcame their wrong ideas and deeply mobilized the masses. In just half a month, the factory realized 34 major innovations, made 13 various machines by itself, and changed 62 hand looms to electric ones. The degree of mechanization soared from 2% to 75%. There are many examples of this kind. Facts have proved that wherever politics is put in command and wherever the general line is resolutely implemented, the technical innovation movement there will surely be done well.

Our socialist construction has entered a new stage, and what lies before us is a great leap forward situation. The people of our province must closely follow the pace of progress of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the State Council, and under the guidance of the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, bring the current vigorous technical innovation movement to a new climax, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state ahead of schedule and overfulfill them, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960, and strive to comprehensively change the social and economic outlook of Anhui Province!

    把技术革命的群众运动推向新的高峰
    黄岩代表谈安徽省技术革新运动的成就和经验各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和全国人民代表大会常委会的报告，并在实际工作中贯彻执行。现在我就安徽省开展技术革新运动的情况向大会作一汇报。
    技术革新运动步步深入
    毛主席早在1955年就曾明确地指示：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”（“关于农业合作化问题”）毛主席的指示，深刻而又简明地指出了技术改造的重大意义，给我们提出了一项光荣的历史任务。安徽的技术革新运动就是在毛主席的号召下开展起来的。
    安徽原来是一个灾多灾重的地区，原有的工农业生产水平都是不高的。为了尽快地改变安徽“更穷更白”的落后面貌，我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，解放后，一方面在完成了土地改革以后，经过一系列的步骤，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行了社会主义改造，在农村实现了人民公社化，使生产关系适应了生产力不断发展的需要；另一方面，又对工农业生产各个部门进行技术改造，广泛深入地开展了技术革新运动，从工具、工艺过程和生产管理等方面不断地进行改革，提高了劳动效率，促进了整个国民经济的全面的迅速的发展。
    还在1950年，由于治水的需要，中共安徽省委提出了对治水工具进行改革的要求，开始对各种挖土和运土工具加以改造，1953年起，我省推行农业生产三项改革，又根据需要相应地进行了工具改革，但这些改革，还没有能够形成群众运动，只是技术革新的萌芽。技术革新真正成为运动，却是在领会了毛主席的指示精神以后。特别是在实现1958年和1959年全面大跃进中，为了克服劳动力不足的困难，省委根据毛主席指示的精神，提出了大搞技术革新，一个人顶两个人，提高劳动效率，做到增产不增人以至增产又减人的号召。全省人民响应了这个号召，广泛开展了技术革新运动，运动规模之大，内容之多，效果之好，均为前所未有。从城市到农村，从工农业生产到交通、财贸、文教、除四害等各项工作，都在轰轰烈烈地进行技术革新，形成了“处处闹革新，事事闹革新，人人闹革新”的局面。
    几年来，由于对技术革新抓的比较早，比较紧，对新技术的推广也比较快、比较广，效果也比较显著。这些效果的集中表现，就是生产的迅速发展和劳动力的大量节约。从农业战线上看，去年1月到今年3月，全省推广使用新式农具和改良农具共有四千七百多万件，大大提高了劳动工效，减轻了劳动强度，节约了劳动力，保证了连续大跃进。仅去年一年，我省节省劳动工日即达二十亿个，占原计划用工七十四亿个劳动日的27％。治水工地的技术革新运动效果尤为突出。治水工地面广而又分散，开展技术革新要比城市困难。1950年刚开始治淮时，每人每日平均工效仅零点九公方，到1957年也才提高到一公方以上。从1957年冬季起，全省水利工地有计划地进行了工具改革，工效提高到三点八公方。去冬今春，水利工地又以不断革命精神大搞技术革新运动，每人日工效又跃升到十三公方左右。现在，全省水利工地挖、装、运、卸、压等各道工序已普遍使用了改良工具和半机械化工具，并做到配套成龙。各地还打破了专机专用的思想，普遍把排灌机械用来带动治水工具，发挥综合利用的效果，整个水利工地使用机械已达三万多马力，使水利工具向机械化大大迈进一步。由于技术革新运动的广泛开展，使去冬原计划每日平均上工七百五十万人减少为五百万人，节约了二百五十多万人。截至3月中旬为止，全省已完成水利土方五十五点八亿公方，超过原计划71.2％。由于劳动力的大量节约，不仅超额完成了水利任务；同时还保证了各项农业生产的全面发展，去冬今春全省共开荒六百多万亩，田间管理、短途运输、副业生产等也比去年做得更好。现在我省农业战线上以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动正方兴未艾，已发展到广泛地利用水力、风力、沼气等自然能源，今年以来已安装好风力机五百多部，风力水车三千四百多部，水力站九百多处，全省已有一千八百三十多个食堂常年利用沼气作燃料，有九万多农户经常利用沼气照明，小型沼气发电站和沼气加工站发展到二百多处。再从工业交通方面看，从去年1月到今年2月，全省广大职工共计提出各种技术革新建议达一百三十五万多项，已经实现的有五十四万多项，从而有力地促进了各项生产建设事业的发展。去年全省工业交通部门新建扩建的项目有一千二百二十一个，总产值增长了55％，但是所使用的劳动力却比1958年减少了三十六万多人。今年1月到3月，随着技术革新运动的深入发展，全省厂矿企业单位又节约了九万多人，并已调出六万多人支援了新建企业单位，实现了增产不增人和增产又减人的要求。在工业技术革新运动中，我省特别抓紧了对炼铁“小洋群”的技术改造，在这方面，我们始终抓住了提高利用系数、降低焦比和提高工效这三个要求。全省小高炉经过技术改造以后，各项技术经济指标有了迅速提高，今年1月份每立方米容积每昼夜的出铁量平均比去年1月份提高163.1％；每吨铁的耗焦量比去年1月份下降93.7％，生铁合格率达到90％以上。芜湖专区五十多座小高炉经过技术改造以后，每立方米容积每昼夜的出铁量平均比去年1月份提高166.6％，铁的合格率达99％，获得了大面积丰收。马鞍山钢铁公司红旗二号八立方米小高炉的职工们，发扬了共产主义风格，大胆破除陈规，风量风温提得更高，大大提高了利用系数，去年12月份这座小高炉每立方米容积每昼夜的出铁量平均比原设计能力提高三点七八倍，创造了我省利用系数的最新纪录。与此同时，我省还在炼钢和冶炼各种高级合金钢等方面进行了技术革新和试验，均获得了显著成绩，目前已能就地取材，自炼若干种合金钢供应某些制造设备的需要，使用的结果很好，都合乎标准。在交通运输方面，我们对装、运、卸各个环节也进行了全面的革新，充分挖掘了运输潜力，提高了运输效率。全省的主要车站、码头都普遍地利用机械化和半机械化的工具代替手工操作，大大提高了工效，缩短了装卸时间，加速车船周转。车辆在站停留时间比过去缩短二分之一到四分之三。去年下半年，我省各地还用自力更生的办法，兴办了八十多公里简易铁路，这些简易铁路的兴建，不仅对增大运输能力、节约劳动力起了重大作用，而且还积累了经验，为我省今后大力发展简易铁路，打下了良好的基础。
    目前，我省的技术革新运动已经进入一个新的阶段，革新的范围不断扩大，革新内容不断提高；由单项革新发展到革新整个作业线，在许多方面发展成一条龙；由点的革新发展到面的革新，由不平衡发展到平衡；工具由木制发展到铁制；由改良工具发展到半机械化和机械化，由人工操作发展到半自动化和自动化。现在运动正以汹涌澎湃之势迅速向前发展，我们正在抓住当前的有利形势，把技术革新运动更深入地开展下去，争取提前完成我省全面改造社会经济面貌的任务。
      几个关键性的问题
    根据中央的指示和过去的经验，我们体会到，要搞好技术革新运动，必须解决以下几个关键性的问题：
    第一，领导和群众结合
    领导干部要亲自抓，认真抓，只有这样，才能把群众带动和组织起来，领导干部抓技术革新的办法主要有三个：一是领导干部亲自动手，培养重点，指导全面；二是群众提建议，技术人员作审查，领导干部作选择，然后组织力量进行研究，试验成功后再行推广；三是领导出题目，大家做文章，然后总结提高。采取这种方法，既能发挥广大干部、群众革新技术的积极性，又能解决生产人员和技术人员单方面所不能解决的很多重大问题。如我们在治水工具改革运动中，从省委到公社党委，都是第一书记亲自挂帅，经常和工农群众技术人员一起，研究和解决技术革新中的问题，保证了治水工效迅速提高。又如在创造插秧机的过程中，省委主要负责同志亲自和有生产经验的农民、工人、技术人员一起，经过长期的反复的钻研，终于制成了一种插得快、插得稳、牵引轻便、分秧均匀的插秧机，解决了过去分秧不匀和部分漂秧的毛病。又如淮南炼焦厂在土法炼焦中，存在着产量质量不高、结焦时间长、劳动强度大等问题。根据这种情况，领导上提出改革窑形的题目，工人们响应号召，先后进行了八种窑型的试验，在试验过程中，总支书记和厂长跟班劳动，和窑师、瓦工、技术人员共同研究失败的原因，寻找解决问题的办法，最后终于改革成功“淮一型”炼焦窑，节约劳动力50％，还大大降低了劳动强度。在今后大搞技术革新运动中，我们仍然要坚决实行领导和群众相结合的办法。
    第二，土和洋结合
    从实际情况出发，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，把土洋密切地结合起来，这样才能够调动广大群众的积极性，做到自力更生，把技术革新运动不断地推向前进。我省的技术革新，主要是依靠土洋结合的办法搞起来的。如合肥政法钢铁厂，坚决贯彻了自力更生的原则，在改造冷热风管道时没有钢板，就用废料脚料焊接拼凑起来，在改造煤气管道时，没有钢管，就用砖和水泥砌成管道代替，迅速完成了对小高炉的一系列技术改造任务，从而促进了产量的上升。当然，不论土的办法还是洋的办法，都要不断发展，不断提高，土洋并举，大中小并举，不论是在当前或者今后，都是必须遵循的方针。我们在1958年大办钢铁运动中发展起来的钢铁“小洋群”，经过一系列的技术改造，发挥出很大的优越性，以后又把这一经验继续推广到炼焦、采矿、煤炭、化工等方面，都收到多快好省的效果。因此，在技术革新的过程中，既要抓大的洋的，又要抓小的土的；既要抓手工操作向半机械化、机械化的改革，又要抓半机械化向机械化、机械化向自动化的改革；既要抓新设备的制造，又要抓现有设备的改造。只有这样，才能调动广大群众的积极性，把技术革新运动又快又好地开展起来。
    第三，点和面结合
    在技术革新运动中，我们采取了层层设点、事事设点的办法。由于点设得多，就便于从各方面集中群众的智慧，吸取适于各种不同条件的经验；由于点多，在试验成功以后，也容易迅速地普遍推广。在实行点面结合的过程中，要求各级领导干部亲自抓点，做到每一个技术革新的项目都切实可靠；而在某项技术革新项目切实成功以后，就立即采取现场会议、参观、展览、表演等各种方式，大张旗鼓地组织推广。在推广使用过程中，再根据群众在实践中的经验，不断地加以提高。因此，点与面的结合，也就是试验与推广的结合，普及与提高的结合。如马鞍山建筑安装公司第三工程处木工厂对技术革新的项目，采取群众鉴定的办法，召开本厂和外厂工人开现场会共同鉴定，在鉴定过程中，又吸取其他厂先进经验，加以充实、完善和提高。这样，既起了试验的作用，又起了推广的作用，既起了普及的作用，又起了提高的作用。又例如治水运土滑车，1957年冬开始推广时是用手摇辘轳绞动，人工装卸；在推广使用过程中，群众不断加以改进提高，先是发展为簸箕式的运土器，可以自动装卸；以后又进而改为穿档装卸，而且还能翻埂过坝；在去冬治水运动中，又把它改为动力运土滑车，工效比原来提高了十几倍，比人力挑抬提高了几十倍。许多类似的事例都充分说明，技术革新是没有止境的，人们的智慧是没有穷尽的，普及、提高、再普及、再提高，如此无限循环，就会使技术革新运动不断地向前发展。在技术革新中，还必须抓住重点，把主要力量放在劳力花得多、劳动强度大、季节性较强的环节和部门，如治水、运输、采掘、播种、收割、加工、养猪设备以及厂矿企业的手工劳动等等。这些地方对技术革新的要求最为迫切，潜力最大，能节省出的劳力也最多。当前抓住这些环节和部门，就能够收到事半功倍的效果。
    第四，科学研究与制造相结合
    技术革新运动的开展和提高，是与先进的科学技术有密切联系的。1959年以来，我省科学技术事业有了进一步的发展。现在全省从省到县，从厂矿企业到人民公社，都普遍建立了科学研究机构；许多农业中学也切实贯彻了教学、生产、科学研究三结合的方针，成为人民公社农业科学研究的基地；许多生产队，也注意搞科学研究；群众性的科学技术组织已经遍布广大城乡。为了使科学研究密切为生产服务，我们实行了科学研究与制造相结合的原则，一方面，积极领导科学研究机构和各厂矿企业、各类学校科技人员，深入群众，深入生产实际，根据生产的需要，和群众结合，革新技术，制作和改进生产工具，把科学研究的过程当作生产工具的制作和改进的过程。另一方面，领导和组织各个生产部门，大力进行科学研究，以先进的科学技术知识来武装每一个人，做到凡是有生产活动的地方，就有科学研究活动，使生产工具的改革，生产技术的提高，都有先进的科学技术作指导，把开展技术革新的过程，当作进行科学研究的过程。由于科学研究与生产密切结合，专业科学人员与广大群众密切结合，大大推动了技术革新运动的发展。例如工业生产小洋群中许多技术问题的解决，沼气利用的半机械化、半自动化的实现，以及一些比较先进的农业机具如风力机、插秧机、绳索牵引机等的创造，都是在党的统一领导下，经过专业科学工作者和群众中涌现出来的生产能手共同努力，边研究、边制造所取得的成就。我们今后还要继续坚持这个方针，以促进技术革新运动进一步开展。
    第五，要发扬坚持到底的顽强精神
    无论做什么事情，都要有股干劲，技术革新也是这样。只有破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，技术革新才能搞得起来、坚持下去。任何新事物的成长，任何一件新的发明创造，总是要经过曲折的，它不仅会遇到保守思想的抵抗，而且会遇到经验不足、物质条件不足的困难。问题在于坚持。首先要能顶得住右倾保守思想的歪风，其次要善于总结经验教训，顽强地继续试验。每战胜一道难关，就是向最后成功接近了一步，而在一个环节上松了劲，就会半途而废，甚至功亏一篑。不仅试验过程中要坚持，在推广使用的过程中也要坚持，因为任何一项新技术，总是从不完善到完善，在使用的过程中从不熟练到熟练，从不习惯到习惯，如不坚持下去，即使是很好的新技术，也可能推广不开。我省在试验和推广使用沼气的过程中，证明了这一点。还在1957年，省委就提出发展沼气化的号召，当时许多地方都进行试验，在试验中，大部分地区都因未能冲破技术关，就中断了，唯有阜阳县的干部和群众，在县委领导下坚持试验，他们不理睬人家的讽刺，失败了再干，坚持干了两年，终于在物质条件不足的情况下，解决了沼气池漏气、沼气过冬、储存、输送等问题，实现了沼气化，为全省推广沼气树立了榜样。像这样的事例，各个地区和各个战线上都有很多。它告诉我们，发挥顽强的坚持精神，是搞好技术革新的一个重要关键。
    最后，坚持政治挂帅，是推动技术革新运动健康发展的根本动力
    目前蓬勃开展着的技术革新运动，是政治思想战线社会主义革命的一个结果，而技术革新的过程仍然是思想革命的过程。在技术革新运动中，不仅存在着先进与落后、革新与保守的斗争，同时也存在着资产阶级思想与无产阶级思想的斗争，因此，就必须认真做好政治思想工作，深入地宣传和贯彻党的总路线，用毛泽东思想把广大干部、群众武装起来。我们在技术革新方面所以能够做出比较显著的成绩，正是坚持政治挂帅的结果。技术革新的胜利，就是党的总路线的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利！政治挂帅对技术革新的重要性，从合肥市针织毛纺厂的事实可以看得很明显。这个厂过去有些领导干部存在着“唯条件论”的思想，考虑问题总是把困难摆在前面，技术革新搞了半年，还停留在试验阶段。经过反右倾、鼓干劲的整风运动以后，他们在党的帮助之下克服了错误思想，深入地发动了群众，仅仅用了半个月的时间，全厂就实现了三十四项重大革新，自制各种机器十三部，手工织机改为电动的六十二部，机械化程度由2％猛升到75％。这一类例子，是很多的。事实证明：哪里坚持了政治挂帅，哪里坚决执行了总路线，哪里的技术革新运动就一定搞得好。
    我国的社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的阶段，摆在我们面前的是一片大好的跃进形势。我省人民一定要紧紧跟随全国的前进步伐，在毛主席、中共中央和国务院的领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的指引下，把当前轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，推向新的高峰，为提前超额完成国家给予我们的任务，实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗，为全面改变安徽省的社会经济面貌而奋斗！
