Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th April. The work of preventing and controlling wheat diseases and insect pests in Henan Province has entered a decisive stage.

This year, wheat diseases and insect pests in Henan Province are more serious than in previous years, with a wide area affected and rapid spread. However, thanks to early action, sufficient preparation, sound organization, and timely forecasting and reporting in various regions, successive victories have been achieved with remarkable results. As early as last winter, comprehensive prevention and control measures were implemented for wheat with individual plants affected by leaf rust, minimizing overwintering disease sources. Since the beginning of spring, the province has universally carried out a general survey of wheat diseases and insect pests. To date, 93% of wheat fields affected by rust in the province have been treated, and the spread of rust has been basically controlled.

Currently, the majority of wheat blossom midges have risen to the surface soil. While continuing to sweep away residual rust and strengthen lodging prevention, various regions are seizing this favorable opportunity to fully launch the prevention and control of wheat blossom midges. The insect control army in Kaifeng Prefecture has entered the battlefield, launching an "on-site training" campaign, determined not to let any wheat blossom midges escape. Su Zhenhua, Secretary of the CPC Luoyang Prefectural Committee, personally serves as the commander-in-chief, directing the extermination of insects. Nanyang Prefecture rushed all the 666 powder in its warehouses to various production teams within two days. The CPC Xinyang Prefectural Committee held an on-site meeting on the prevention and control of wheat blossom midges in Zhumadian, deciding to seize the favorable opportunity and eliminate them in one fell swoop.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng Prefecture in Shandong Province has launched a wheat "Three Acceleration" campaign of "transforming average yields to high yields, late-sown crops to early-sown crops, and third-class seedlings to first-class seedlings." Through watering at the jointing stage, topdressing fertilizer, loosening the soil to preserve moisture, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, the 5.4 million mu of high-yield wheat fields in the prefecture are generally growing vigorously, promising a bumper harvest; 780,000 mu of the 2.1 million mu of average wheat fields have caught up with the high-yield wheat; 1.03 million mu of the 1.79 million mu of late-sown wheat have caught up with the early-sown wheat; and 1.08 million mu of the 1.5 million mu of third-class seedlings have also been upgraded.

Party committees at all levels in the Liaocheng area have successively convened mobilization rallies, carried out top-down ideological mobilization by summarizing previous wheat management experience and commending model workers, overcoming the complacency and paralysis among some cadres and masses, and the passive mentality of relying on heaven for rain, and establishing the idea of long-term drought resistance to win a bumper harvest. Cadres at all levels responded to the provincial party committee's call for "six-level cadres to meet in the fields," and rushed to the front lines of drought resistance.

In the "Three Acceleration" campaign, various regions adopted the method of assigning responsibility at each level, fixing measures, leadership, and labor to the fields, and promoted a management responsibility system to ensure that the wheat "Three Acceleration" campaign moves forward quickly and well. After inspection and ranking, Guan County proposed different management measures for different growth conditions of various wheat fields, which vigorously promoted the development of the wheat field management campaign. In order to eliminate 270,000 mu of third-class wheat seedlings at the jointing stage, Pingyuan County adopted "ten fixings" of leadership, labor, plots, water volume, fertilizer, tools, time, quality, work points, and rewards, and "four to the fields" of political work, office work, technical guidance, and recreational sports activities, which promoted the management of third-class seedlings. Now, 190,000 mu of wheat fields in the county have been watered, 240,000 mu of wheat fields have received "extra meals," and 170,000 mu of wheat seedlings have been transformed from weak to strong and upgraded.

    河南防治小麦病虫害连战皆捷
    山东聊城专区狠抓三类麦苗力争全面丰产
    新华社郑州27日电　河南省防治小麦病虫害的工作已进入决战阶段。
    河南省今年小麦病虫害比往年严重，受害面广，蔓延迅速。但是由于各地动手早、准备足、组织健全、测报及时，因而连战皆捷，效果显著。早在去冬，各地就对发生单株叶锈病的小麦全面进行了防治，使越冬病源压缩到最小限度。开春以来，全省又普遍开展了小麦病虫害的普查工作。到目前止，全省发生锈病的麦田，已防治93％，基本控制住了锈病的扩散蔓延。
    目前小麦吸浆虫大部上升表土，各地在继续横扫锈病残余、加强防倒伏工作的同时，都紧紧抓住这一有利时机，全面展开了对小麦吸浆虫的防治工作。开封专区治虫大军已经进入阵地，展开“现场练兵”运动，坚决不让吸浆虫漏网。中共洛阳地委书记处书记苏振华亲任指挥长，指挥灭虫。南阳专区两天内把全区所有库存的六六六粉赶运到各生产队。中共信阳地委在驻马店召开了防治吸浆虫现场会议，决定掌握有利时机，一举加以歼灭。
    据新华社讯　山东省聊城专区掀起“一般赶丰产、晚茬赶早茬、三类赶一类”的小麦“三赶”运动。经过浇拔节水、追肥、松土保墒、防治病虫害，全区五百四十万亩丰产麦田普遍生长旺盛，丰收在望；二百一十万亩一般麦田，已有七十八万亩赶上了丰产麦；一百七十九万亩晚茬麦，已有一百零三万亩赶上了早茬麦；一百五十万亩三类麦，也有一百零八万亩升了级。
    聊城地区各级党委都先后召开誓师动员大会，通过总结前段小麦管理经验、评比奖模范，进行了自上而下的思想发动，克服了部分干部、群众中存在的自满麻痹思想和靠天等雨的消极情绪，树立了长期抗旱夺取丰收的思想。各级干部响应省委提出的“六级干部会师田间”的号召，纷纷走出办公室，奔赴抗旱前线。
    各地在“三赶”运动中，采取了逐级包干的办法，将措施、领导、劳力固定到田，推行管理责任制，保证小麦“三赶”运动既快又好地向前发展。冠县经过检查排队，针对各类麦田的不同生长情况提出了不同的管理措施，有力地推动了麦田管理运动的发展。平原县为了将二十七万亩三类麦消灭在拔节关，采取了领导、劳力、地块、水量、肥料、工具、时间、质量、工分、奖励“十定”，政治工作、办公、技术指导、文娱体育活动“四到田”等办法，促进了三类苗的管理。现在这个县已有十九万亩麦田浇上了水，二十四万亩麦田吃了“偏饭”，有十七万亩麦苗已由弱变壮升了级。
