The "News Weekly" in Beirut reported on the 16th that the secretariat of the International Committee for the Defense of Hélou issued a statement saying, "Nasser denied at a press conference in Bombay that a person named Farajallah Hélou was being held in Damascus prison, but he cannot deny that a person named Assaf Manour is being held, and this person is Farajallah Hélou." The statement added: "The International Committee for the Defense of Hélou possesses irrefutable facts proving that Farajallah Hélou was arrested in Damascus under the name of Assaf Manour in June of last year, and proving that he is frequently tortured in the place where he is being held."

The newspaper also reported that the International Committee for the Defense of Hélou has sent a telegram to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry, requesting the conference to intervene for the release of Hélou, the outstanding fighter for national independence, peace, and democracy in Lebanon.

The International Committee for the Defense of Hélou was established to demand the release of Farajallah Hélou, an outstanding fighter of the Lebanese National Liberation Movement and one of the leaders of the Lebanese Communist Party, who was illegally arrested in Damascus on June 25 last year.

At the end of last year, the Lebanese National Committee for the Defense of Hélou issued an appeal calling on the public in Lebanon, Arab countries, and countries around the world to establish an international committee to fight for the release of Hélou. This appeal immediately received widespread support from prominent figures from various countries. In mid-January of this year, a number of internationally renowned jurists, scientists, and the Lebanese Committee for the Defense of Hélou held a meeting in Beirut, after which the International Committee for the Defense of Hélou was established. After its establishment, the committee has repeatedly issued appeals demanding the immediate release of Hélou or his transfer to a court for trial. In addition, it has also requested that a doctor designated by Hélou's wife be allowed to visit Hélou in prison in the Syrian region for a medical examination. Currently, there are approximately one hundred prominent figures from more than twenty countries participating in the International Committee for the Defense of Hélou, including Ettore Tibaldi, Vice President of the Italian Senate, Ferdinando Targetti, Vice President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Henrique Fialho, Brazilian lawyer and former Chief Justice of the Rio de Janeiro Court, Louis Aragon, Chairman of the National Committee of French Writers, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Zhang Youyu, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, Daniel Latifi, lawyer of the Bombay Supreme Court of India, as well as parliamentarians, professors, writers, journalists, poets, doctors, and jurists from many countries such as Japan, Greece, Australia, and Mongolia.

    保卫赫卢国际委员会发表声明
    赫卢确被监禁在大马士革
    本报综合报道　据贝鲁特“消息周报”16日报道，保卫赫卢国际委员会秘书处发表声明说，“纳赛尔在孟买举行的记者招待会上否认大马士革监狱里关着一个名叫法拉贾拉·赫卢的人，但是，他不能否认关着阿萨夫·曼努尔这个人，这个人就是法拉贾拉·赫卢。”声明又说：“保卫赫卢国际委员会掌握着无可辩驳的事实，证明法拉贾拉·赫卢在去年6月间以阿萨夫·曼努尔的名字在大马士革被捕，并且证明，在监禁他的地方，经常对他进行拷打。”
    这家报纸还报道，保卫赫卢国际委员会已经打电报给在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会，要求大会为释放黎巴嫩争取民族独立、和平和民主的杰出战士赫卢的事情进行干涉。
    保卫赫卢国际委员会是为了要求释放去年6月25日在大马士革被非法逮捕的黎巴嫩民族解放运动杰出战士、黎巴嫩共产党领导人之一法拉贾拉·赫卢而成立的一个国际性组织。
    去年底，黎巴嫩保卫赫卢全国委员会发出呼吁书，要求黎巴嫩、阿拉伯国家和世界各国公众成立一个争取释放赫卢的国际委员会。这个呼吁，立即获得各国著名人士的广泛支持。今年1月中，一些国际著名的法学家、科学家、和黎巴嫩保卫赫卢委员会在贝鲁特举行了会议，会后成立了保卫赫卢国际委员会。委员会成立后曾多次发出呼吁，要求立即释放赫卢，或者把他移交法庭审理。此外，还要求让赫卢夫人所指定的医生到叙利亚地区的监狱中去探望赫卢，为他检查身体。现在，参加保卫赫卢国际委员会的已有二十多个国家的约一百位著名人士，其中包括意大利参议院副议长埃托雷·蒂巴迪、意大利众议院副议长费迪南多·塔尔杰蒂、巴西律师和前里约热内卢法庭庭长恩里克·费雅利奥、法国作家全国委员会主席路易斯·阿拉贡、中国作家协会主席茅盾、中国政治法律学会副会长张友渔、印度孟买最高法院律师丹尼尔·拉蒂菲，以及日本、希腊、澳大利亚、蒙古等许多国家的议员、教授、作家、记者、诗人、医生和法学家。
