Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the meeting on the current international situation and China's foreign relations. Premier Zhou's speech was greeted with extremely warm applause from the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech on the morning of April 10th at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress on the current international situation and China's foreign relations.

	The International Situation is More Favorable to World Peace and Socialism,
	The Strength of the Socialist Camp is the Main Guarantee for Maintaining World Peace

Premier Zhou Enlai first pointed out that recently, the international situation has shown a certain degree of easing, and the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. The general trend is developing in a direction that is more favorable to world peace and socialism. This is the result of the repeated struggles of socialist forces, national independence movement forces, and peace-loving democratic forces against the forces of imperialist aggression and war.

Premier Zhou said that the socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, is now stronger than ever before. Socialist countries are generally accelerating their construction, and have achieved new and brilliant successes in industry, agriculture, and science and technology. The influence of the peaceful foreign policies of socialist countries is expanding day by day. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and other countries has played a positive role in easing the international situation. The unity and cooperation among socialist countries are constantly strengthening. The conspiracies of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to sow discord in the socialist camp have met with shameful failure. The strength and unity of the socialist camp is the main guarantee for striving for easing international tensions and maintaining world peace.

	The National Independence Movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Continue to Surge, and the Hypocritical Face of U.S. Imperialism is Recognized by the Broad Masses of People

Premier Zhou said that the movements against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence and safeguarding national independence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to surge. In Africa, the awakening of the broad masses of people is rapidly increasing. The flames of anti-colonialism have been ignited throughout the African continent. A series of countries have declared independence or achieved a certain degree of independence. Old-brand imperialism attempts to maintain its colonial interests through certain formal concessions, while U.S. imperialism is employing various means to infiltrate Africa, attempting to replace these old-brand imperialists. However, these conspiracies will always be exposed by the African people who persist in the anti-colonialist struggle. The Algerian people are heroically persisting in the armed struggle against the suppression by the French colonial army. The people in many parts of East Africa, Central Africa, and West Africa have risen up to fight for independence. Recently the Africans of the Union of South Africa launched a large-scale struggle against racial discrimination. The Chinese people wholeheartedly sympathize with and support their just struggle. In Latin America, the Cuban people are resolutely opposing U.S. interference and consolidating the revolutionary achievements of national independence and democratic freedom. The people of other Latin American countries have also overthrown dictatorships fostered by the United States, or are fighting for this purpose. The national democratic movement has generally surged in Latin America. U.S. President Eisenhower's so-called "goodwill visit" to South America not long ago not only failed to curb the anti-American anger of the Latin American people, but further promoted their struggle and unity. In Asia, the national democratic movement is also deepening. In the nationalistic countries that have already achieved independence, the broad masses of people are increasingly strongly demanding the implementation of a peaceful neutral policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, maintaining national independence, strengthening the unity of Asian countries, and opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and war. The hypocritical face and divisive tactics of U.S. imperialism are increasingly being recognized by the broad masses of people.

	The Imperialist Camp is Further Moving Towards Disintegration. The Aggressive Policy of U.S. Imperialism Has Not Changed, and the People of the World Must Persist in the Struggle

Premier Zhou said that contrary to the increasingly strong socialist camp and the increasingly powerful national independence movement, imperialism is rotting away day by day. The militarization of the national economies of imperialist countries not only fails to alleviate but further deepens the general crisis of capitalism. The contradictions between monopoly capital and the broad masses of people have undergone new developments. Large-scale strikes are increasing, and the struggle of the working masses for peace, democracy, and the right to live is rising day by day. The recent large-scale struggle of black people in the United States against racial discrimination is a sign of the increasing awakening of the American people. Due to the shrinking capitalist world market and the uneven development of capitalism, the hegemonic position of the United States in the capitalist world has been relatively weakened. The contradictions between imperialist countries in the struggle for markets and colonies continue to intensify, and the entire imperialist camp is further moving towards disintegration.

Premier Zhou Enlai then pointed out that precisely because the balance of power is increasingly unfavorable to imperialism and the forces of war, the U.S. ruling group has been forced to make certain gestures of easing, such as agreeing to hold an East-West summit meeting and resuming negotiations on disarmament issues. However, the U.S. ruling group is still obstructing the resolution of many major international issues. The most aggressive U.S. imperialist policy has not changed. While making certain peaceful gestures, the U.S. ruling group continues to step up its arms expansion and war preparations, frantically develop missile weapons and missile bases, and make every effort to strengthen and attempt to expand aggressive military blocs, and tries in every possible way to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on disarmament issues. The U.S. ruling group is vigorously supporting the revival of militarism in Japan and West Germany. These two countries are becoming war hotbeds in Asia and Europe. Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke are openly colluding under the instigation of the United States. As the head of the world's reactionary forces, U.S. imperialism continues to intensify its interference and suppression of the revolutionary movements of various countries. The powerful socialist camp is the biggest obstacle to U.S. imperialism's establishment of world hegemony. Imperialism has never given up on spreading rumors and slanders, sowing discord, subverting and sabotaging, militarily encircling, and even threatening war against socialist countries. All these situations show that all peace-loving people around the world must be vigilant against the aggressive activities and war conspiracies of the imperialist group headed by the United States and persist in the struggle. Only in this way can world peace be truly maintained.

	The Solidarity and Friendship Between the People of All Countries and the Chinese People is the Mainstream. The Anti-China Activities Incited by the United States Have Led to Results Contrary to Their Wishes

Premier Zhou Enlai, when talking about China's foreign relations, said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, while devoting themselves to socialist construction, have made unremitting efforts together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and with all peace-loving countries and people, to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. The great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction by holding high the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have had a wide-ranging impact internationally and have been praised by hundreds of millions of people. The peaceful foreign policy of New China has stood the test of time and is being understood and supported by more and more people. Our friends are all over the world. In order to prevent the expansion of China's influence and isolate China in international affairs, imperialism headed by the United States has stirred up a vicious anti-China wave. Although this conspiracy has been echoed by reactionaries, revisionists, and those who agree with them, clamoring for a while, the result has been the opposite of their wishes, exposing their own faces. Because our People's Republic of China is a socialist country, a country that strives for the interests of the people, a country that is working hard in peaceful domestic construction, and a country that is determined to fight for the defense of world peace, therefore, in the relations between China and other countries, the solidarity and friendship between the people of all countries and the Chinese people is the mainstream, and anti-China activities are only a countercurrent. Anti-China are only a very small number of imperialists, reactionaries, revisionists, and those who agree with them. The vast majority of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist national bourgeoisie, and other people who advocate peace and have a sense of justice not only do not oppose China, but also warmly demand friendship with China.

	All Issues Between China and Asian Nationalist Countries Can Be Reasonably Resolved Through Friendly Consultation Based on the Five Principles

Premier Zhou Enlai said that in the past year, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China's friendly relations and economic and cultural exchanges with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been further developed. Our country has established diplomatic relations with Morocco, Sudan, and Guinea. Our country has recently established economic and cultural ties with more than 20 countries and regions in Africa and Latin America. Our country and these countries have a common historical experience, a common desire to maintain world peace and oppose imperialism and colonialism, and a common desire to develop national economies and cultures. This is a reliable basis for our country to establish and develop friendly cooperative relations with these countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese government and people have always pursued a peaceful foreign policy towards Asian nationalist countries and are willing to develop friendly cooperative relations with these countries on the basis of the Five Principles. We firmly believe that no matter what complicated issues left over from history exist between our country and these countries, they can be reasonably resolved through friendly consultations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The recent conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, and the signing of agreements between China and Burma, and China and Nepal on border issues, most powerfully prove this point. This is a new example of friendly solidarity among Asian countries and a major victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Similarly, we also see that there is a good start to resolving the issue of overseas Chinese between China and Indonesia. The two sides have exchanged instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality and have established a joint committee to implement this treaty. The work of repatriating some of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia is underway. We hope that the two sides will continue to work hard, cooperate in a friendly manner, and comprehensively and reasonably resolve the issue of overseas Chinese. Regarding the friendly relations between China and India, we also have ardent hopes. We are pleased to see that the Indian government has agreed to the Chinese government's proposal for a meeting between the premiers of China and India. In a few days, I will leave to visit the great neighboring country of India. We sincerely hope that this visit and the meeting with Prime Minister Nehru will produce positive results. We firmly believe that the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian people will eventually shine brightly.

	China Supports the Japanese People's Struggle for Independence. If the Kishi Government Does Not Abandon its Policy of Hostility Towards China, Sino-Japanese Relations Cannot Be Improved

When talking about Sino-Japanese relations, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people have always been friendly to the Japanese people. We express deep sympathy and support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. The Chinese government and people resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China and the revival of Japanese militarism. The military alliance treaty signed between the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States is against the interests of the people of Japan and the United States. In the long run, this treaty is a disastrous treaty for the Japanese people. This treaty not only threatens the security of China and the Soviet Union, but also directly threatens the security of the people of Southeast Asian countries first and foremost. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government does not abandon its policy of hostility towards China, Sino-Japanese relations cannot be improved. The current abnormal state of Sino-Japanese relations is entirely the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

	Resolutely Oppose the U.S. Conspiracy to Create "Two Chinas." Any International Agreement Without China's Participation Has No Binding Force on China

When talking about Sino-U.S. relations, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the state of tension between China and the United States has not changed to this day, and the responsibility lies entirely with the United States. China has always advocated peaceful coexistence and mutual non-aggression with all countries, and the resolution of disputes between each other by peaceful means. As early as 1955, the Chinese government stated that the Chinese people are friendly to the American people, China does not want to fight with the United States, and China is willing to sit down and talk with the United States. In the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, we have repeatedly suggested that the two sides jointly issue a statement guaranteeing that they will not use force to resolve international disputes between the two countries. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no outsider shall interfere. However, the United States has asked China to give up its sacred sovereignty over Taiwan, its own territory. To this day, the United States is still occupying our territory of Taiwan by force, and has repeatedly violated our territorial waters and airspace, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government, and has carried out military provocations and war threats. At the same time, the United States is doing everything possible to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to legalize its occupation of Taiwan. Under such circumstances, the Chinese people cannot but fight to the end to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose U.S. aggression. The Chinese government once again declares that the Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; China will never participate in any international conference or any international organization where there may be a situation of "two Chinas"; any international agreement, without the participation and signature of Chinese representatives, will have no binding force on China.

	Continuously Consolidating and Strengthening the Solidarity of the Socialist Camp is the Sacred Duty of the Chinese People

When talking about China's relations with other socialist countries, Premier Zhou Enlai said that China's friendly solidarity and economic and cultural cooperation with all fraternal countries have been further strengthened. The Chinese people have received friendly assistance from the great ally the Soviet Union and fraternal countries in socialist construction, and the Chinese government and people express their heartfelt gratitude for this. Based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of proletarian internationalism, constantly consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp is the sacred duty of the Chinese people. This is not only the highest interest of the Chinese people, the highest interest of the people of all socialist countries, but also the highest interest of all progressive mankind. The Chinese government and people fully support the Soviet Union's peaceful initiatives on convening an East-West summit meeting, comprehensive disarmament, and banning nuclear weapons, as well as its major efforts to ease international tensions. The Chinese government and people also fully support the just struggles of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the German Democratic Republic for the peaceful reunification of their respective countries.

	China Will Continue to Strive for the Realization of the Proposal for All Countries in the Asian and Pacific Region to Conclude a Treaty of Peace and Mutual Non-Aggression, and to Establish a Nuclear-Free Zone

Premier Zhou Enlai finally said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people sincerely hope that international tensions will be further eased, world peace will be further consolidated, the national independence movement will achieve further victories, and friendly relations between countries will be further developed. In order to ensure peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region, the Chinese government has repeatedly suggested that all countries in this region conclude a treaty of peace and mutual non-aggression, and that this entire region be established as a nuclear-free zone. The Chinese government will continue to work to achieve this proposal. If this proposal is realized, the clauses in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance concerning the prevention of the resurgence and re-aggression of Japanese militarism can be canceled. The Chinese government and people will continue to adhere to a peaceful foreign policy, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and consistently and tirelessly strengthen solidarity with socialist countries, solidarity with Asian, African, and Latin American national independence countries, solidarity with national independence movement forces, and solidarity with all peace-loving people and countries in the world, resolutely oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war, and promote with full confidence the further development of the international situation in a direction that is conducive to world peace, national independence, and socialism.

    周恩来总理在人大会议上发表重要讲话  阐述当前国际形势和我国对外关系问题
    新华社10日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，在10日上午继续举行大会。周恩来总理在会上就目前国际形势和我国对外关系问题发表了讲话。周总理的讲话受到了全场极其热烈的欢迎。
    出席中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议的全体委员列席了大会。
    今天上午大会的执行主席是：林伯渠、沈钧儒、刘澜涛、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、王维舟、刘格平、陈嘉庚、张治中、蔡畅、张经武、孟泰、罗世发、荣毅仁、周文江。
    新华社10日讯　周恩来总理4月10日上午在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，就目前国际形势和我国对外关系问题发表了讲话。
      国际形势更加有利于世界和平和社会主义，
  社会主义阵营的强大是维护世界和平的主要保证
    周恩来总理首先指出，最近一个时期，国际形势出现了一定程度的和缓，东风继续压倒西风，总的趋势朝着更加有利于世界和平和社会主义的方向发展。这是社会主义力量、民族独立运动力量和和平民主力量同帝国主义侵略战争势力反复进行斗争的结果。
    周总理说，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营现在比过去更加强大。社会主义各国建设速度普遍加快，无论在工业、农业和科学技术方面都获得了新的辉煌的成就。社会主义各国的和平外交政策的影响日益扩大。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志对美国和其他国家的访问，对和缓国际局势起了积极的作用。社会主义各国之间的团结和合作不断加强。帝国主义、现代修正主义和其他各国反动派对社会主义阵营进行挑拨离间的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。社会主义阵营的强大和团结，是争取和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的主要保证。
      亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动继续高涨，美帝国主义的伪善面目为广大人民识破
    周总理说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的运动继续高涨。在非洲，广大人民的觉醒迅速提高。整个非洲大陆到处燃起了反殖民主义的烽火。一系列的国家宣布了独立或者取得了一定程度的独立。老牌帝国主义企图用某些形式上的让步，来保持他们的殖民利益，而美国帝国主义则玩弄各种手段钻进非洲，企图取这些老牌帝国主义的地位而代之。但是，这种种阴谋总是要被坚持反殖民主义斗争的非洲人民戳穿的。阿尔及利亚人民英勇地坚持着反对法国殖民军队镇压的武装斗争。东非、中非和西非许多地方的人民纷纷起来争取独立。最近南非联邦的非洲人展开了反对种族歧视的大规模斗争。中国人民衷心地同情和支持他们的正义斗争。在拉丁美洲，古巴人民正在坚决反对美国的干涉阴谋，巩固民族独立和民主自由的革命成果。另外一些拉丁美洲国家的人民也推翻了美国所豢养的独裁政权，或者正在为此而进行着斗争。民族民主运动在拉丁美洲普遍地高涨起来。美国总统艾森豪威尔不久以前到南美去进行的所谓“亲善访问”，不但没有能够遏止拉丁美洲人民的反美怒潮，反而更加促进了他们的斗争和团结。在亚洲，民族民主运动也更加深入。在已经取得了独立的民族主义国家中，广大人民日益强烈地要求奉行以和平共处五项原则为基础的和平中立政策，维护民族独立，加强亚洲各国的团结，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。美国帝国主义的伪善面目和挑拨伎俩越来越为广大人民所识破。
      帝国主义阵营进一步走向四分五裂。美帝国主义侵略政策没有改变，世界人民必须坚持斗争
    周总理说，同社会主义阵营日益强盛和民族独立运动日益壮大的情况相反，帝国主义正一天天地烂下去。帝国主义国家国民经济的军事化，不但不能减轻反而更加加深资本主义的总危机。垄断资本同广大人民之间的矛盾有了新的发展，大规模的罢工越来越多，劳动大众争取和平、民主和生活权利的斗争日益高涨。最近在美国爆发的声势浩大的黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，就是美国人民日益觉醒的一个标志。由于资本主义世界市场的缩小，由于资本主义的发展不平衡，美国在资本主义世界的霸主地位相对地削弱了，帝国主义各国之间争夺市场和殖民地的矛盾继续加剧，整个帝国主义阵营进一步走向四分五裂。
    周恩来总理接着指出，正是由于力量对比日益不利于帝国主义和战争势力，美国统治集团不得不被迫作出某些和缓的表示，例如同意举行东西方最高级会议、恢复裁军问题的谈判等。但是，美国统治集团仍在阻挠许多当前重大的国际问题的解决。最富侵略性的美国的帝国主义政策并没有改变。美国统治集团在作出某些和平姿态的同时，继续加紧扩军备战，狂热地发展导弹武器和导弹基地，竭力加强并且企图扩大侵略性的军事集团，千方百计地阻挠就裁军问题达成协议。美国统治集团大力扶植日本和西德的军国主义复活。这两个国家正在重新成为亚洲和欧洲的战争策源地。阿登纳和岸信介在美国的怂恿下公开进行勾结。美帝国主义作为世界反动力量的头子，继续加紧干涉和镇压各国人民的革命运动。强大的社会主义阵营是美国帝国主义建立世界霸权的最大障碍。帝国主义一天也没有放弃对社会主义各国的造谣污蔑、挑拨离间、颠复破坏、军事包围以至战争威胁。所有这些情况说明，全世界一切爱好和平的人民对于以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略活动和战争阴谋，必须提高警惕，坚持斗争。只有这样，才能真正维护世界和平。
    各国人民和中国人民的团结友好是主流。美国煽起反华活动，其结果走向他们愿望的反面
    周恩来总理在谈到我国对外关系的时候说，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在致力于社会主义建设的同时，同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起，同所有爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平作了不懈的努力。中国人民在社会主义建设中由于高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗而取得的伟大成就，在国际上发生了广泛的影响，受到了亿万人民的赞扬。新中国的和平外交政策，经受了时间的考验，正在为越来越多的人们所理解和支持。我们的朋友遍于全世界。以美国为首的帝国主义为了阻止中国影响的扩大和在国际事务中孤立中国，煽起了一个恶毒的反华浪潮。这种阴谋，虽然曾经得到各国反动派、修正主义分子和附和他们的人的呼应，叫嚷一时，但是结果却走向他们的愿望的反面，暴露了他们自己的面目。因为我们中华人民共和国是社会主义的国家，是为人民利益而奋斗的国家，是努力从事国内和平建设的国家，是坚决为保卫世界和平而奋斗的国家，所以，在中国和各国的关系中，各国人民和中国人民的团结友好是主流，反华活动只是一股逆流。反华的只是为数极少的帝国主义分子、反动分子、修正主义分子和附和他们的人，占人类绝大多数的工人、农民、革命知识分子、反帝反殖民主义的民族资产阶级以及其他主张和平和有正义感的人们，不但不反华，而且热烈地要求同中国友好。
    中国同亚洲民族主义国家之间的一切问题，只要根据五项原则友好协商都可以求得合理解决
    周恩来总理说，一年来，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，中国同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的友好关系和经济文化交流，有了进一步的发展。我国同摩洛哥、苏丹、几内亚建立了外交关系。我国最近又同非洲和拉丁美洲二十多个国家和地区建立了经济和文化的联系。我国和这些国家有着共同的历史遭遇，有着维护世界和平和反对帝国主义、殖民主义的共同愿望，有着发展民族的经济和文化的共同愿望。这是我国同这些国家建立和发展友好合作关系的可靠基础。
    周恩来总理说，中国政府和人民对于亚洲民族主义国家，从来就奉行和平外交政策，愿意在五项原则的基础上同这些国家发展友好合作的关系。我们坚决地相信，不论我国和这些国家之间存在着历史上遗留下来的任何复杂问题，只要根据和平共处五项原则进行友好协商，都是可以求得合理解决的。最近中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的缔结，中缅、中尼关于边界问题的协定的签订，最有力地证明了这一点。这是亚洲国家友好团结的新范例，是和平共处五项原则的重大胜利。同样的，我们也看到，关于解决中国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题，现在也有了一个良好的开端。双方已经互换了关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，并且成立了有关实施这个条约的联合委员会。关于遣送在印度尼西亚的一部分华侨回国的工作，正在进行。我们希望，双方继续努力，友好合作，使华侨问题得到全面的合理解决。关于中国同印度的友好关系，我们同样寄予热烈的希望。我们高兴地看到印度政府已经同意中国政府关于中印两国总理会晤的建议。再过几天，我就要动身去访问伟大的邻邦印度。我们衷心地希望这次访问和同尼赫鲁总理的会晤，将会产生积极的效果。我们深信，中印两国人民的传统友谊终将放出灿烂的光芒。
      中国支持日本人民争取独立的斗争。岸政府不放弃敌视中国的政策，中日关系就不可能改善
    在谈到中日关系的时候，周恩来总理说，中国人民对日本人民一贯是友好的。我们对于日本人民为争取独立、民主、和平、中立的日本而进行的英勇斗争，给予深切的同情和支持。中国政府和人民坚决反对岸信介政府敌视中国和复活日本军国主义的政策。岸信介政府和美国签订的军事同盟条约是违反日美两国人民的利益的。从长远来看，这个条约对于日本人民是一个灾难性的条约。这个条约，不仅威胁中国和苏联的安全，而且首先直接威胁东南亚各国人民的安全。岸信介政府一天不放弃敌视中国的政策，中日关系就一天不可能改善。中日关系目前的不正常状态，其责任完全在于岸信介政府。
    坚决反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。任何国际协议没有中国参加，对中国毫无约束力
    谈到中美关系的时候，周恩来总理说，中国和美国之间的紧张状态，至今没有改变，其责任完全在美国。中国一贯主张同各国和平共处，互不侵犯，并且用和平方法解决彼此之间的争端。早在1955年，中国政府就声明过，中国人民同美国人民是友好的，中国不要同美国打仗，中国愿意同美国坐下来谈。在中美大使级会谈中，我们又一再建议双方共同发表声明，相互保证不使用武力解决两国之间的国际争端。解放台湾是中国的内政，任何外人不得干涉。但是美国却要求中国放弃解放自己的领土台湾的神圣主权。直到今天，美国仍然武力侵占着我国的领土台湾，并且不顾中国政府的多次警告，不断侵犯我国的领海和领空，进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。同时，美国还千方百计地制造“两个中国”，企图使它霸占台湾合法化。在这种情况下，中国人民不能不为维护主权和领土完整、反对美国侵略而斗争到底。中国政府再一次声明，中国人民坚决反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋；任何国际会议和任何国际组织，只要有可能出现“两个中国”的局面，中国绝不参加；任何国际协议，如果没有中国代表的参加和签字，将对中国毫无约束力。
    不断巩固和加强社会主义阵营的团结，是我国人民的神圣职责
    谈到中国和其他社会主义各国的关系的时候，周恩来总理说，中国同各兄弟国家的友好团结和经济文化合作，都有了进一步的加强。我国人民在社会主义建设中得到了伟大盟邦苏联和各兄弟国家的友好援助，我国政府和人民对此表示衷心的感谢。根据马克思列宁主义的原则，在无产阶级国际主义的基础上，不断地巩固和加强社会主义阵营的团结，是我国人民的神圣职责。这不仅是中国人民的最高利益，社会主义各国人民的最高利益，也是全体进步人类的最高利益。中国政府和人民完全支持苏联关于召开东西方首脑会议、全面裁军、禁止核武器等和平创议以及为和缓国际紧张局势而作的重大努力。中国政府和人民也完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和德意志民主共和国为争取各自祖国的和平统一的正义斗争。
    中国将继续争取实现亚洲和太平洋地区各国缔结互不侵犯的和平公约的建议，建立无原子区
    周恩来总理最后说，中国政府和中国人民衷心地希望国际紧张局势得到进一步的和缓，世界和平得到进一步的巩固，民族独立运动得到进一步的胜利，各国的友好关系得到进一步的发展。为了保障亚洲和太平洋地区的和平和安全，中国政府曾经多次建议这个地区的所有国家缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建立为无原子区。中国政府将继续为争取这一建议的实现而努力。在实现了这一建议的情况下，中苏友好同盟互助条约中有关防止日本军国主义再起和重新侵略的条款就可以取消。中国政府和人民将继续坚持和平外交政策，坚持和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，始终不懈地加强同社会主义各国的团结，同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族独立国家的团结，同民族独立运动力量的团结，同世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家的团结，坚决反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，满怀信心地促使国际局势进一步朝着有利于世界和平、民族独立和社会主义的方向发展。（附图片）
