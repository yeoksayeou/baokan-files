Economic Science Research Must Keep Up With The Times

Speech by Representative Wang Yanan

Fellow representatives:

Please allow me to offer some opinions on vigorously developing economic science research to accelerate socialist construction.

In my speech at the first meeting of this association last year, I advocated that workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres study political economics, including three arguments:

First, in the 1958 cultural and educational revolution, we broke down scientific superstitions and expert worship, liberated our thinking, and a new phenomenon emerged in various places where workers, peasants, and the masses studied philosophy and political economics. Experience has proven that they can not only learn, but their work and ideological conditions also make it easier to learn well.

Second, workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres studying political economics will have a more conscious and automatic ideological foundation for understanding, implementing, and executing the Party's guidelines and policies in economic work and economic life.

Third, if the masses and general cadres all study political economics, it will become pressure or impetus for those already standing in practical economic work positions, especially those in economic theory work positions, placing more and higher demands on them. The general principle of improvement on the basis of popularization and popularization under the guidance of improvement is fully applicable to the study and research of political economics.

If the study and research of political economics thoroughly implement the mass movement and the "walking on two legs" policy, it will greatly improve the level of economic theory and greatly accelerate socialist construction. I said this last year, and I want to emphasize this view now and use it to roughly examine and measure the development trends of our economic circles over the past year.

Everything is advancing by leaps and bounds; economic theory research must keep up with the situation

What kind of development trends have our economic circles shown in the past year? This can be roughly seen from two aspects: on the one hand, the socio-economic changes in recent years have been significant and rapid, and all relevant aspects are advancing by leaps and bounds. According to the saying that thinking generally lags behind reality, economic theory research has already failed to keep up with the situation; coupled with the fact that our researchers are not ideologically liberated enough, old traditions, and new authorities, all become obstacles to our progress. For example, in the first half of last year, economic theory discussions were launched in various forms throughout the country, mainly discussing commodity production, the law of value, and piece-rate wages; that discussion implemented the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy, and everyone expressed their opinions freely. The discussion atmosphere was enthusiastic, but the results of the discussion showed some one-sidedness; there was no full recognition that all commodity-currency relations and value relations based on bourgeois equal rights, although still have some necessity in our socialist society, not only have changed in nature and effect, but even the scope of possible effects is constantly shrinking and changing with the growth of the socialist economy, the increase of communist bud factors, and the improvement of the level of awareness and understanding of the broad masses of working people. In the end, it will inevitably lead to elimination. However, despite the facts, among our researchers, those who are more detached from reality and the masses, or those who feel that maintaining and consolidating bourgeois equal rights is beneficial to them, intentionally or unintentionally use capitalist methods to deal with commodity production, the law of value, and piece-rate wage issues under our social system, overemphasizing the role of the law of value, excessively expanding the scope of the law of value, and even some people eternalize the law of value; it seems that the rapid growth of labor productivity and the continuous improvement of the level of material production technology in our socialist society are basically the result of correctly applying the law of value, implementing the principle of distribution according to labor, and implementing the piece-rate wage system, which makes laborers care about their labor results from the perspective of personal material interests. Is that really the case? In the mass innovation movement and socialist labor competition, how many of the thousands of technical innovators, the thousands of active producers, and even the broad masses who participated in labor to complete various production and construction tasks, showed such selfless labor spirit and soaring enthusiasm for the sake of earning more Renminbi? Of course, the time for us to victoriously complete the Three Great Transformations and the rectification and anti-rightist struggle is not very long, the communist awareness of our general people is not high enough, and the consumer goods that our production technology level can provide are far from meeting the constantly growing needs of the broad masses. Under such circumstances, it is unrealistic to completely ignore the role of the law of value and the principle of distribution according to labor. But the question is: should we try our best to emphasize these laws and principles, and guide the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of working people towards the petty-bourgeoisie and bourgeois world outlook that is concerned about personal material interests? Or should we only apply these laws and principles within a certain appropriate scope, and gradually guide the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of working people towards the collectivist and communist world outlook? Obviously, if the Party and the government's policy is to take the latter idea as guidance, and it has proved its unparalleled correctness from the ideological life and labor enthusiasm of the people, then the conclusions drawn by some of our economic theory workers who take the former idea as guidance are not only divorced from politics, but also from reality and the masses. Therefore, in the process of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes in the first half of last year, the theories that were talked about eloquently and considered timely, once the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, and the people of the whole country launched a greater and higher leap forward upsurge on all fronts, the reality of those theories immediately became problematic. Many of our theoretical workers immediately felt confused and lost confidence; in the face of the situation of continued great leap forward, they felt their own backwardness. Although in the research process, our economic circles had extremely different performances in various regions, in various aspects, among young and old researchers, and between economic practical workers and theoretical workers, but on the whole, the situation of economic theory lagging behind the situation was obviously not reversed in the past year.

New forces in economic circles are constantly forming and growing

But on the other hand, we must also see the new factors and new conditions in our economic circles that oppose old traditions, break new authorities, and change the original situation of theoretical lagging behind the situation, especially the new forces, are constantly forming and growing. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the work in all aspects and on all fronts of our country is promoting and supervising each other, and making new changes and leaps forward in different ways. Economic circles are certainly no exception. In fact, the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes have especially put forward new research tasks and requirements for economic circles, which makes our economic theory workers and even practical economic workers have to rise up vigorously to contribute to the socialist cause. The economic theory research and discussion work carried out in various parts of the country last year, although as we mentioned earlier, was still far behind the situation and still showed some one-sidedness in some aspects, but compared with the past, there was a great leap forward. In just one national discussion meeting, not only young workers and old workers, economic theory workers and practical economic workers, happily gathered together and exchanged opinions without any restraint, which seemed unprecedented; and among the nearly one million words of special reports and papers submitted by everyone, many excellent theoretical products came from the hands of those comrades who engaged in practical economic work; at the same time, many valuable investigation and research reports were actually collectively investigated and researched by economic research institutions and teaching units. Of course, this is not an isolated phenomenon, but a preliminary manifestation of the spirit of the Party's cultural and educational revolution in economic theory work. It is precisely because the tendency of theory linking with practice is gradually forming, and the new economic theory team is growing rapidly, so the certain one-sided and conservative tendencies shown in economic research in the first half of last year were quickly reversed under the call of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to oppose right-leaning and encourage vigor, and continued to leap forward. But speaking of this, it seems necessary to point out this fact. From the launch of the education revolution movement in the first half of 1958, the launch of the cultural and technical innovation movement in the second half of the same year, to 1959, it was only about a year. Within this short period of time, whether it was teachers and students of universities, cadres of organs, or staff of research units, they all participated in production labor, contacted reality, approached the masses, and cultivated the spirit of collective cooperation in various forms, which is undoubtedly laying a material and ideological foundation for healthy economic theory work in the future. In fact, in the last few months of 1959, economic teaching and research units in various places not only continued to carry out investigation and research work in different ways, but also respectively exerted the collective strength of the masses in Mao Zedong's economic thought, the Party's economic policies, the history of national economy in China and foreign countries, the history of the Three Great Transformations, the political economics reader, the research and compilation of various economic theory topics, and even the criticism of vulgar bourgeois theories and revisionism and reformism, and made many achievements. We cannot say that this is a great leap forward.

Comparing and examining from the above two aspects, we know that although our economic theory work is still far behind the situation, our economic circles are already stepping up efforts to change this situation in all aspects; we have realized that to vigorously develop economic theory work, we must further thoroughly liberate our minds and improve our understanding, we must seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds; we must carry out division of labor and cooperation in a planned and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership of the Party.

To vigorously develop economic theory work,
we must further thoroughly liberate our minds

Why do we say that to vigorously develop economic theory work, we must further thoroughly liberate our minds and improve our understanding? In the period of continuous great leap forward in socialist construction, the economic problems that need to be researched and solved are not only extremely numerous and complex, but also extremely urgent. If, as in the past, we let a few professional researchers undertake or monopolize this work, it will not work in any way. The effect of our recent mass mobilization to engage in economic investigation and research work has been very obvious, but because everyone's superstition of science and experts is not completely broken, the mass mobilization to engage in economic science research work is still restricted by the ideological shackles of old traditions and new authorities, and has not been fully launched. In fact, these two aspects are mutually causal. If the masses are not greatly mobilized to make achievements, it is impossible to completely break down superstitions. Therefore, firmly implementing the Party's mass line and the "walking on two legs" policy in economic science research is still our most urgent task at present.

To vigorously develop economic theory work,
we must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought

Why do we say that to vigorously develop economic theory work, we must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds? Mao Zedong Thought is the development of Marxism-Leninism applied to the practice of Chinese revolution and construction, comprehensively guiding the practice of Chinese revolution and construction, and summarizing the experience of Chinese revolution and construction. Its philosophical basis is the highly developed theory of practice and the theory of contradiction of dialectical materialism, and the most basic starting point of its theory of practice is production practice, which is production labor practice. All socio-economic activities take production labor practice as its basis. If economic theory is not divorced from reality and can serve our socialist construction, and can contribute to accelerating socialist construction, it must first take root in production labor practice. Only in production labor practice can we see clearly the real situation of the broad masses of working people fighting against nature; and only in production labor practice can we see clearly the relationship between the working people and their labor attitude towards socialist construction. Whether we study commodity production and the law of value, or study distribution according to labor and piece-rate wages, without being baptized and tempered in production labor practice, and establishing a certain friendship with the working masses, our theory will lack a realistic foundation and will not only be divorced from reality, but also from the masses. This is an important reason why we showed some one-sidedness and conservative tendencies in the economic theory discussion meeting in the first half of last year. The social significance of the education revolution is to fundamentally eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor, and its scientific significance is to eliminate the root cause of the disease of theory being divorced from reality. The result of nearly two years of implementing the education revolution has proved its unparalleled correctness in all aspects. In economic science research, researchers, teachers, and students participated in the "two participations, one reform" work, and carried out labor while investigating and researching, and achieved great results. Everyone not only transformed learning as a result, but also transformed their thinking. Not only did they recognize the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, but also recognized the importance of seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought. Seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought is a great driving force for us to carry out economic research work.

To vigorously develop economic theory work,
we must, under the unified leadership of the Party,
carry out division of labor and cooperation in a planned and step-by-step manner

Why do we say that to vigorously develop economic science research work, we must carry out division of labor and cooperation in a planned and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership of the Party? Due to the rapid development of socialist construction, economic theory research work has also become very urgent and important. Now various regions of the country and even relevant business departments have launched economic investigation and research work in different ways, which is undoubtedly a good phenomenon. But in the entire national economy, there are very close connections between the central government and various regions, between various regions, and between various relevant business departments. The national economy needs to develop at a high speed and in a planned way under a certain plan. National economy investigation and research must also be comprehensively led, supervised, and arranged under a certain plan, and the manpower and material resources that can be mobilized in all aspects should be used for the most necessary and most important work; the existing teaching and research bases should be respectively deployed with regular investigation and research bases, and the connections for division of labor and cooperation should be respectively established. Under the leadership of the Party, we have done a lot of work in this area in the past two years, such as joint investigation, zonal centralized discussion, regular exchange of experience, and frequent exchange of investigation and research data, etc., but according to the decentralized, repetitive, and spontaneous situations of relevant work from time to time, it seems urgently necessary to further strengthen the Party's unified leadership.

In addition to the above three points, I also feel that to vigorously develop economic science research work, the struggle against bourgeois economic theory, especially against various revisionism and reformism, is of decisive importance. Our economic research workers must, with a high sense of responsibility to the Party's cause and the people's cause, give full play to the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in research and discussion, according to the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy. If some critical atmosphere has been shown in our economic forums in recent years, the atmosphere of self-criticism still needs to be formed.

These are some immature views of mine on economic theory research work, and I would like to ask the representatives for their opinions.

### 经济科学研究工作要赶上时代  王亚南代表的发言

专栏：

    经济科学研究工作要赶上时代
    王亚南代表的发言诸位代表：
    请允许我就大力开展经济科学研究工作，来加速社会主义建设的问题，提供一点意见。
    在去年本会第一次会议的大会发言中，我曾倡议工农大众、工农干部学习政治经济学，其中包括三个论点：
    一、在1958年文化教育革命运动中，破除科学迷信，破除专家迷信，解放思想，各地分别出现了工农大众学哲学，学政治经济学的新现象。经验证明：他们不仅能够学，而且他们的工作思想条件，还比较容易学得好。
    二、工农大众、工农干部学习政治经济学，他们对于认识，贯彻、执行党在经济工作、经济生活方面的方针政策，就更有了自觉自动的思想基础。
    三、群众和一般干部都学起政治经济学来了，那对于已经站在实际经济工作岗位上，特别是对于那些站在经济理论工作岗位上的同志，就会成为一个向他们提出更多更高要求的压力或推动力。在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下普及的大原则，在政治经济学的学习研究上，是完全适用的。
    政治经济学的学习和研究，如果贯彻了大搞群众运动和两条腿走路的方针，一定会大大提高经济理论水平，大大加速社会主义建设。我去年是这么讲，现在还要强调这个看法，并用这个看法，来粗略地考察衡量我们经济学界这一年来的发展动态。
    各方面都在突飞猛进，经济理论研究工作要跟上形势
    一年来，我们经济学界究竟表现了怎样的发展动态呢？那大体可以从两个方面看出来：一方面是近年来的社会经济变动很大，发展很快，有关各方面都在突飞猛进，单根据思想一般总难免落后于现实的说法，经济理论研究已经跟不上形势；加上我们研究工作者思想解放不够，旧的传统、新的权威。在在都成为阻挠我们前进的障碍。比如说罢，去年上半年在全国范围内以各种形式展开了经济理论的讨论，主要讨论了商品生产、价值规律和计件工资等问题；那种讨论，贯彻了党的百家争鸣方针，大家知无不言，言无不尽地抒发己见，讨论的情绪是热烈的，但讨论的成果，却表现了某些片面性；没有充分认识到，一切基于资产阶级平等法权的商品货币关系，价值关系，在我们社会主义社会，虽然还有一定的必要性，可是，不但性质变了，作用变了，连可能作用的范围，也在随着社会主义经济的成长，共产主义萌芽因素的增加和广大劳动人民觉悟认识水平的提高，而不断在缩小改变。最后，还必然要归于消灭。可是事实尽管如此，在我们研究者中间，愈是脱离实际脱离群众的人，或者愈是觉得维持并巩固资产阶级平等法权对自己有利的人，就有意无意地用资本主义的章法，来处理我们社会制度下的商品生产、价值规律和计件工资问题，过分夸大价值规律的作用，过分扩大价值规律作用的范围，甚至有人还把价值规律永恒化了；仿佛我们社会主义社会的劳动生产率的迅速增长、物质生产技术水平的不断提高，也基本上是由于正确运用了价值规律，实行按劳分配制度，实行计件工资制度，使劳动者从个人物质利益关心自己劳动成果的结果。事实果真是这样么？在大搞群众革新运动和社会主义劳动竞赛中，千千万万的技术革新者，千千万万的生产积极分子，甚至为完成各种生产基建任务而参加劳动的广大群众，究竟有多少人是为了多拿一点人民币才表现出那样忘我劳动精神和冲天干劲的呢？当然，我们胜利完成三大改造和整风反右斗争的时间还不很久，我们一般人民的共产主义觉悟还不够高，我们的生产技术水平所能提供的消费物资还远不能满足广大人民不断增长的需要，在这样的情况下，完全忽视价值规律作用和按劳分配原则，是不现实的，但问题在于：我们究是应该竭力强调这些规律原则，把广大劳动人民的思想意识导向斤斤计较个人物质利益的小资产阶级资产阶级的世界观方面？抑是应当只是在一定的适当的范围内，运用这些规律原则，逐渐把广大劳动人民的思想意识导向集体主义共产主义的世界观方面？很显然地，如果说我们党和政府的方针政策是把后一种思想作为指导，并且已从人民的思想生活和劳动热情中证明了它的无比正确性，那么，我们有些经济理论工作者把前一思想作为指导所得出的结论，就不但脱离政治，也脱离实际，脱离群众了。所以在去年上半年整顿巩固人民公社过程中，谈得天花乱坠，认为切合时宜的理论，一到党的八届八中全会决议公布，全国人民在各个战线上，兴起更大更高的跃进热潮，那些理论的现实性，立刻就发生了问题。我们许多理论工作者，立刻就感到困惑，失却了自信；在继续大跃进的形势前面，感到自己的落后了。虽然在研究过程中，我们经济学界在各地区，各方面，在青老研究工作者间，在经济实际工作者和理论工作者间，有了极其不同的表现，但整个说来，经济理论落后于形势的局面，在过去一年中，显然是没有扭转过来的。
    经济学界的新生力量正在不断形成和成长
    可是在另一方面，我们也必须看到我们经济学界反对旧传统、打破新权威，改变原来那个理论落后于形势的局面的新因素、新条件，特别是新生力量，在不断形成和成长。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们全国各个方面各个战线上的工作都在相互推动、相互督促，分途作着新的转变和跃进。经济学界也当然不能例外。事实上，由于大跃进和人民公社特别为经济学界提出了新的研究任务和要求，就更使得我们经济理论工作者乃至实际经济工作者，都不能不跃然奋起，以期对社会主义事业作出贡献。去年在全国各地分别开展的经济理论研究讨论工作，虽然如我们前面所讲的，还大大地落后于形势，还在某些方面表现了片面性，但比起过去来，却有很大的跃进，单是在一次全国性的讨论会中，不仅青年工作者与老年工作者、经济理论工作者与实际经济工作者，欢然团聚一堂，毫无拘束地交换意见，显得盛况空前；并且在大家提出的将近一百万言的专题报告和论文中，有不少优秀的理论成品，竟是出自那些搞实际经济工作的同志之手；同时，不少有价值的调查研究报告，又居然是由经济研究机关和教学单位集体调查研究出来。当然，这不是一个孤立现象，而是党的文化教育革命精神在经济理论工作上的初步表现。正是由于理论联系实际的倾向在逐渐形成，新的经济理论队伍在迅速成长，所以，去年上半年在经济研究中表现的某些片面的保守的倾向，在党的八届八中全会的反右倾、鼓干劲的号召下，又很快扭转过来，继续向前跃进了。但讲到这里，似乎有必要指出这一个事实，从1958年上半年展开教育革命运动，同年下半年展开文化技术革新运动，到1959年，只不过是一年左右的时间，就在这短暂的时期内，不论是高等学校的师生，是机关干部，还是研究单位的工作人员，都分别以这样那样的形式，参加了生产劳动，联系了实际，接近了群众，培养了集体协作精神，这些都无异为今后的健康的经济理论工作打下了物质的思想的基础。事实上，在1959年的最后几个月中，各地的经济教学研究单位，不仅在分途继续进行调查研究工作，并还分别发挥群众集体力量，在毛泽东经济思想，在党的经济政策，在中外国民经济史，在三大改造史，在政治经济学读本，在各种经济理论专题的研究和编写方面，乃至在对庸俗资产阶级学说和修正主义、改良主义的批判方面，作出了很多成绩。我们不能不说这是很大的跃进。
    从上面这两个方面来加以比较考察，就知道，我们的经济理论工作，尽管还大大落后于形势，但我们经济学界已经在从各方面加紧努力来改变这种状态；我们已经体会到，要大力开展经济理论工作，必须进一步彻底解放思想提高认识，必须认真学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑；必须在党的统一领导下，有计划、有步骤地进行分工协作。
    要大力开展经济理论工作，
    必须进一步彻底解放思想
    为什么说，要大力开展经济理论工作，必须进一步彻底解放思想，提高认识呢？在社会主义建设不断继续大跃进时期，经济上待研究解决的问题，不但异常繁多、复杂，而且极其紧迫，如果像过去一样，让少数专业研究工作者去承担或包办这个工作，那是怎么也行不通的，我们近年来发动群众搞经济调查研究工作的效果，已经非常明显，但由于大家对科学的迷信，对专家的迷信，还破除得不够彻底，对于发动群众大搞经济科学研究工作，还在受着旧传统，新权威的思想束缚，没有全面展开。事实上，这两方面是互为因果的，不把群众大大发动起来，作出了成绩，又不可能完全破除迷信。所以在经济科学研究上，坚决贯彻党的群众路线和两条腿走路的方针，仍是我们当前的一项最迫切的任务。
    要大力开展经济理论工作，
    必须认真学习毛泽东思想
    为什么说，要大力开展经济理论工作，必须认真学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑呢？毛泽东思想是把马克思列宁主义应用到中国革命建设实践中，全面指导中国革命建设实践，总结中国革命建设经验而发展起来的。它的哲学基础是高度发展了辩证唯物主义的实践论和矛盾论，而它的实践论的最基本出发点又是生产实践，是生产劳动实践。一切社会经济活动是把生产劳动实践作为它的基础。要经济理论不脱离实际，能为我们社会主义建设服务，能对加速社会主义建设作出贡献，它首先就必须在生产劳动实践方面扎下根子。只有在生产劳动实践中，我们才能看清广大劳动人民和自然作斗争的真实情况；也只有在生产劳动实践中，我们才能看清劳动人们相互间的关系以及他们对于社会主义建设的劳动态度。我们研究商品生产、价值规律问题也好，研究按劳分配、计件工资问题也好，没有在生产劳动实践中受过洗礼，作过锻炼，和劳动群众建立起一定的交情，就要使我们的理论缺乏现实的基础，不但脱离实际，也脱离群众。这就是我们去年上半年在经济理论讨论会中表现了某些片面性和保守倾向的一个重要原因。教育革命的社会意义，是要根本消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，而其科学意义，则是要消除理论脱离实际的病根。教育革命将近施行两年的结果，已在各方面证示了它的无比正确性，在经济科学研究方面，也由研究工作者，教师与学生分别参加两参一改工作，进行边劳动、边调查研究作业，而获得了极大成绩。大家不但因此改造了学习，也改造了思想。不但因此认识了毛泽东思想的正确性，也认识了认真学习毛泽东思想的重要性。认真学习毛泽东思想，是我们开展经济研究工作的一个伟大动力。
    要大力开展经济理论工作，
    必须在党的统一领导下，
    有计划有步骤地分工协作
    为什么说，要大力开展经济理论研究工作，必须在党的统一领导下，有计划有步骤地进行分工协作呢？由于社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，经济理论研究工作也变得非常迫切而重要了。现在全国各地区乃至有关的业务部门，已在分途展开经济调查研究工作，这无疑是一个好现象。但在整个国民经济中，中央与各地区间，各地区相互间，各有关业务部门间，是有非常密切联系的。国民经济需要在一定计划下作着高速度有计划地发展，国民经济调查研究，也必须在一定的规划下，加以全面的领导、督促和安排，把各方面可能调度的人力和物力使用在最必要最重要的工作上；就已有的教学和研究的据点，分别部署经常性的调查研究基地，分别建立起分工协作的联系。在党的领导下，我们近两年已经在这方面做了不少工作，如联合调查、分区集中讨论，定期交流经验，经常交换调查研究资料等等，但根据各方面不时表现的有关工作的分散、重复、自发自流情况，似乎迫切需要进一步加强党的统一领导。
    除了上述三点之外，我还感到，要大力展开经济科学研究工作，对于资产阶级经济理论，特别是对于各种修正主义、改良主义的斗争，具有决定性的重要意义。我们经济研究工作者，必须以对党的事业、对人民的事业的高度负责态度，在研究讨论中，根据党的百家争鸣方针，充分发挥批评与自我批评的精神，如果说我们经济论坛上近年已经表现了一些批评气氛，而自我批评的风气，却还有待于形成。
    这是我关于经济理论研究工作方面的一些不成熟看法，提请代表们指教。
