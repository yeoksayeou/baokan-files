Our three Vice Premiers’ reports eloquently prove the superiority of socialism and fully demonstrate the correctness of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In two years, our people have completed the main targets of the original Second Five-Year Plan. We feel proud and extremely excited about this unprecedented brilliant achievement.

We are particularly pleased that in 1959, almost two large enterprises went into production every day, and one hundred and fifty small and medium-sized enterprises went into production. This will play a significant role in accelerating our country's industrialization. We have a hundredfold confidence in the continued leap forward in the future. We will certainly be able to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years, without a doubt. Western scholars say that we colored people are inferior races, and their disciples still say that the quality of Chinese workers is poor and that Chinese people are inferior to British people. This is absurd. Under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have already and will continue to exert soaring energy, use their brains, and carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, so that production will increase several times, dozens of times, and hundreds of times, using the most eloquent facts to prove that the wisdom of our working people is endless and that their quality is not bad at all. All oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, regardless of their skin color, can create earth-shattering undertakings as long as they get rid of imperialist oppression and exploitation and their minds are liberated. The great achievements of the Chinese people over the past decade are the best example.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all ethnic minorities in our country have not only gained equal political rights, but have also experienced rapid economic development. Thanks to the vigorous assistance of the advanced Han brothers, many ethnic minorities have surpassed several centuries or even more than a dozen centuries of development in just ten short years. Some ethnic minorities have directly entered socialist society from tribal society. Our country's ethnic policy is the best reference for multi-ethnic countries in Asia and Africa.

Since liberation, the number of employed people in our country has increased significantly every year. Since the establishment of people's communes in 1958, unemployment in our country has been completely eliminated. Since the continued leap forward in 1959, we have felt a shortage of labor in both agricultural and industrial production. Now we are carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution in order to continue the leap forward and rapidly develop production under the condition of increasing production without increasing manpower. However, people with ulterior motives are still spreading the new Malthusian population theory everywhere, falsely claiming that China's population is excessive and that birth control is needed. This reactionary theory is self-defeating in the face of ironclad facts.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report on the draft 1960 national economic plan: "Putting animal husbandry in the same position as planting, and putting pig raising in the first place in animal husbandry, is an important step to promote the overall development of agriculture. One pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. Grasping the pig raising problem is grasping the key to increasing fertilizer in a faster, better and more economical way. When pigs are greatly increased and animal husbandry is greatly developed, the supply of meat will also be solved, and the source of raw materials for light industry will be expanded. While carrying out a large-scale pig-raising campaign in 1960, we must actively develop cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and other livestock and poultry, and pay attention to the development of beekeeping." I think this statement is completely correct. To develop agriculture, we need a lot of fertilizer. Although we are going to produce 2.8 million tons of chemical fertilizer this year, the main fertilizer still depends on natural fertilizer, and the massive development of animal husbandry can solve this problem. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as well as various Hui autonomous prefectures and Hui autonomous counties, have different proportions of Han people. In addition to actively developing cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and other livestock and poultry, we should also reward Han compatriots for carrying out a large-scale pig raising movement to solve their meat supply. This must be done to strengthen national unity and to realize the 1960 national economic plan.

Finally, I welcome and support the movement to establish urban people's communes. We must carry out propaganda and mobilization work among the masses of people to make this great social reform movement a smooth and early realization.

    我国劳动人民正在做惊天动地的事业
    马坚代表的发言
    三位副总理的报告，雄辩地证明了社会主义的优越性，充分地证明了总路线、大跃进、人民公社的正确性。我国人民在两年内完成了原定的第二个五年计划的主要指标。我们对于这种史无前例的辉煌成就，感到自豪和无比的兴奋。
    我们感到特别高兴的是，在1959年内，差不多每天有两个大型企业投入生产，有一百五十个中小型企业投入生产。这对于加速我国的工业化将起重大的作用。我们对于今后的持续跃进具有百倍的信心。我们一定能够在十年之内，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，这是毫无疑义的。西方学者说我们有色人种是劣等民族，他们的徒子徒孙，直到现在还在说中国劳动人民的质量差，中国人不如英国人。这是荒谬绝伦的。中国人民在毛泽东思想的红旗下，已经而且要继续发挥冲天的干劲，开动脑筋，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，使生产几倍、几十倍、几百倍地增加，用最雄辩的事实来证明我国劳动人民的智慧是无穷无尽的，他们的质量一点也不差。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲上一切被压迫的民族，无论他们的肤色如何，只要摆脱帝国主义的压迫剥削，思想获得解放，都能够做出惊天动地的事业。中国人民十年来的伟大成就就是最好的例证。
    我国各少数民族在共产党和毛主席的领导下，不仅获得了政治上的平等权利，而且在经济上有了飞跃的发展，由于先进的汉族老大哥的大力帮助，有许多少数民族在短短的十年之内就超越了几个世纪，乃至十几个世纪的发展历程，有些少数民族从氏族社会直接跨入社会主义社会。我国的民族政策是亚非各个多民族国家最好的参考。
    自解放以来，我国就业人数每年都大量增加。自1958年建立人民公社后，我国的失业现象完全消灭。自1959年继续跃进以来，我国在农业和工业生产上都感到劳动力的不足。现在我们在进行技术革新和技术革命，就是为了在增产不增人的条件下，持续跃进，迅速发展生产。但是别有用心的人还在到处宣传新的马尔萨斯人口论，妄言中国人口过剩，需要节制生育。这种反动的学说，在铁的事实面前，是不攻自破的。
    李富春副总理在关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告中说：“把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，而在畜牧业中又把养猪放在首要地位，这是促进农业全面发展的重要步骤。一头猪就是一个小型的有机化肥工厂。抓住了养猪问题，就抓住了多快好省地增产肥料的关键。猪大量地增加起来，畜牧业大量发展起来，也就解决了肉食的供应，并且扩大了轻工业的原料来源。在1960年开展大规模养猪运动的同时，要积极发展牛、羊、驴、骡、马、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等家畜和家禽，要注意发展养蜂。”我认为这个提法是完全正确的。我们要发展农业就需要大量的肥料，今年虽然要制造化肥二百八十万吨，主要的肥料还要靠自然肥料，大量地发展畜牧业就能解决这个问题。新疆维吾尔自治区和宁夏回族自治区，以及各个回族自治州和回族自治县，都有不同比例的汉族人民，除了积极发展牛、羊、驴、骡、马、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等家畜和家禽外，还应该奖励汉民同胞开展大规模养猪运动，以解决他们的肉食的供应。必须这样做才能加强民族团结，也才能实现1960年的国民经济计划。
    最后，我对于建立城市人民公社运动表示欢迎和支持，我们要在人民群众中进行宣传鼓动工作，使这个伟大的社会改革运动顺利地早日实现。
