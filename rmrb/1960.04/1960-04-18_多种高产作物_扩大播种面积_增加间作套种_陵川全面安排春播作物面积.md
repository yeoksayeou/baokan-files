　　Cultivate More High-Yield Crops, Expand Sown Area, Increase Intercropping and Relay Cropping
    Lingchuan Comprehensively Arranges Spring Sown Crop Area
    (Our Newspaper News) The Lingchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to ensure the implementation and strive for over-fulfillment of various production targets such as grain, oil crops, vegetables, and cash crops, rationally arranged the sown area of various crops before the spring sowing. On March 15th, the County Committee held an enlarged meeting of the County Committee in the Lucheng Commune, conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Prefectural Committee's enlarged meeting, and inspected the current spring plowing preparations and the production targets of various crops. The main problem found in the inspection was that the cultivated land area was reduced compared with last year. This year, due to the universal construction of pig farms, factories, roads, and other capital construction projects, 14,000 mu of cultivated land was occupied, reducing the cultivated land area by 3.5%. From the inspection of cultivated land area occupied by sown crops: the oil crop area was expanded by 10,000 mu compared with last year; flax was expanded by 16,400 mu compared with last year; other cash crops, such as vegetables, medicinal materials, and cotton, were all expanded compared with last year. However, the sown area of ​​grain crops was reduced by 36,600 mu. The inspection also found that if the sowing plan is not arranged reasonably, not only the entire sowing area plan will not be completed, but also the various production targets will be in danger of falling through. Therefore, the Lingchuan County Committee organized the masses to launch a great airing of views, great debate, and great discussion on how to ensure the completion of the state-stipulated sowing area plan for various crops, what methods to take to expand the cultivated land area, and what methods to think of to increase yields. On the basis of everyone's unified understanding, the County Committee also proposed that everyone use their brains, everyone think of ways, and launched a movement to contribute ideas and suggestions to expand the sowing area and increase yields in every possible way. Everyone put forward more than 480 rationalization proposals, which can be summarized as three expansions and ten non-vacancies. The three expansions are: expanding high-yield crops, expanding replanting area, and expanding intercropping. The ten non-vacancies are: barren land is not vacant, small plots of land are not vacant, vacant land in front of and behind houses is not vacant, roadsides are not vacant, vacant land in various newly built factories (farms) is not vacant, ridges and edges are not vacant, reservoir dam surfaces are not vacant, both sides of canals are not vacant, leveled graves are not vacant, and forest clearings are not vacant. The county originally planned to sow 170,000 mu of corn, but after everyone's discussion, it was expanded to 190,000 mu, an increase of 20,000 mu compared with the original plan. Millet yields are not as high as corn, so it was decided to reduce the originally planned 130,000 mu of millet land to 110,000 mu. The original plan was to replant 27,150 mu, but after everyone's discussion, it was expanded to 52,000 mu. The original plan was to intercrop 280,000 mu, but now it has been expanded to 370,000 mu. It is estimated that the above three expansion methods can harvest an additional 10 million catties of grain. Calculated at 300 catties per mu, it can top the sowing area of 34,000 mu. In the discussion, everyone also realized that there are many vacant lands in this year's construction of reservoirs and various factories (farms) and other capital construction projects, and there are also many vacant lands in barren land, forest land and other aspects. After detailed calculations, a total of 50,000 mu of sown area can be expanded. Calculated at 200 catties of grain per mu, ten non-vacant lands can also produce an additional 10 million catties of grain.
    In order to ensure the realization of the sowing area and the output targets of various crops, the sowing area was arranged layer by layer from the county to the commune, from the management area to the production team, and the production targets of various crops were fixed. A four-level (county, commune, management area, production team) system of four-fix rewards was implemented, which fixed land, fixed yield, fixed investment, and fixed labor. Plots were fixed by zoning, and responsibility was clarified by inserting signs, so that regular inspections could be carried out. Now, more than 60,000 spring plowing and sowing troops in the county are carrying out spring sowing according to plan.

### 多种高产作物　扩大播种面积　增加间作套种  陵川全面安排春播作物面积

    多种高产作物　扩大播种面积　增加间作套种
    陵川全面安排春播作物面积
    本报讯　中共山西陵川县委为保证粮食、油料、蔬菜和经济作物等各种生产指标落实并争取超额完成，在春播前合理地安排了各种作物的播种面积。3月15日县委在潞城公社召开县委扩大会议，认真贯彻了地委扩大会议的精神，对当前的备耕工作和各种作物的生产指标进行了检查。检查发现的主要问题是耕地面积比去年减少。今年由于普遍修建猪场、办工厂、修公路等基本建设，占用了耕地一万四千亩，减少耕地面积3.5％。从播种作物占用耕地面积检查看：油料面积比去年扩大一万亩；线麻比去年扩大一万六千四百亩；其它经济作物，如蔬菜、药材、棉花等都比去年扩大。而粮食作物播种面积，则减少了三万六千六百亩。检查中还发现如果不合理安排播种计划，不仅整个播种面积计划完不成，而且各项生产指标也将有落空的危险。因此，陵川县委就如何保证完成国家规定各种作物播种面积计划，采取什么办法扩大耕地面积，想什么办法提高产量为题，组织群众大鸣大放大辩论。在大家认识一致的基础上，县委又提出人人动脑筋，个个想办法，开展了千方百计扩大播种面积，提高产量的献策献计运动。大家共提出了合理化建议四百八十多条，归纳起来，是三扩大，十不空。三扩大是：扩大高产作物，扩大复播面积，扩大间作。十不空是：荒地不空，小块地不空，房前屋后空地不空，公路旁不空，各种新建厂（场）空地不空，堎里堎边不空，水库坝面不空，水渠两岸不空，已平整过的坟地不空，林间空地不空。全县原计划播种玉米十七万亩，经过大家讨论，扩大到十九万亩，比原计划扩大两万亩。谷子产量不如玉米高，决定把原来计划播种十三万亩谷子地，减为十一万亩。原计划复播面积二万七千一百五十亩，经过大家讨论扩大为五万二千亩。原计划间作二十八万亩，现在扩大为三十七万亩。以上三项扩种办法，估计能多收粮食一千万斤。每亩以产三百斤计算，共能顶播种面积三万四千亩。在讨论中，大家还认识到今年兴建水库和各种厂（场）等基本建设方面空地很多，荒地、林地等其它方面的空地也不少。经过详细计算共能扩大播种面积五万亩，每亩以产粮二百斤计，十不空地也能多产粮食一千万斤。
    为保证播种面积和各种作物产量指标的实现，从县到公社，从管区到生产队，层层安排了播种面积，固定了各项作物的生产指标。实行了四级（县、公社、管理区、生产队）定地、定产量、定投资、定用工的四定奖励制度，划片固定地块，插牌明确责任，做到定期检查。现在全县六万多名春耕播种大军，正按计划进行春播。
