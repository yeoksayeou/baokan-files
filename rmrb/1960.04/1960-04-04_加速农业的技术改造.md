Accelerating the Technical Transformation of Agriculture
Zhao Ziyang

Editor's Note: The fifth and sixth issues of Guangdong's "Shangyou" journal published an article by Comrade Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, originally titled "A New Stage in Agricultural Production." The following is an abstract of the second and third parts of this article.

In order to rapidly develop agriculture, we must accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. The main contradiction in current agricultural production is the contradiction between the need for a sustained leap forward in agriculture and backward agricultural tools. Only by accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture and realizing agricultural modernization can this contradiction be completely resolved. Therefore, accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a sustained leap forward in agriculture in the future.

According to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the victorious working class must carry out two transformations of agriculture: one is social transformation, that is, replacing capitalist ownership and individual peasant ownership with socialist ownership; the other is technical transformation, that is, equipping backward agriculture with modern technology. Because we have realized cooperativization and, on the basis of cooperativization, have realized the people's commune system, the social transformation of agriculture has achieved a great victory. While the social transformation has achieved a great victory, it has not only greatly promoted the development of agricultural production, made land contiguous, and created experience in leading large-scale production, but also powerfully promoted the development of industry, making it possible for heavy industry to gradually equip agriculture with modern technology, thereby paving the way for agricultural technical transformation.

According to the experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, to rapidly develop agricultural production, we must not only vigorously increase the yield per unit area, but also actively expand the cultivated area; we must not only greatly develop grain production and cash crops, but also greatly develop animal husbandry, fisheries, and sideline occupations; we must also carry out large-scale farmland capital construction, systematically implement the "Eight-Character Charter," and meticulously carry out intensive cultivation, etc. All of these indicate that the amount of labor used in agricultural production will increase more and more. Although our current agricultural labor productivity has been improved to a certain extent compared with the past, it is still far from meeting the needs of the current rapid development of agricultural production. The tight labor situation in agricultural production over the past two years ultimately reflects this essential problem. The fundamental way to solve this problem is to transform backward agriculture to an advanced technical basis.

Agricultural technical transformation is not only a requirement for the continued leap forward in agriculture, but also a central link in the continued leap forward of industry and the entire national economy. Some people believe that agricultural technical transformation is only a matter for the agricultural sector and has nothing to do with the development of industry and the entire national economy, or they are afraid that emphasizing support for agriculture will affect the development of industry. These ideas are obviously very wrong. Chairman Mao pointed out in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization": "If we cannot basically solve the problem of agricultural cooperativization in about three five-year plans, that is, agriculture leaps from small-scale operations using animal-powered farm tools to large-scale operations using machines,... we will not be able to solve the contradiction between the need for annually increasing commodity grain and industrial raw materials and the generally low yield of major crops at present. Our socialist industrialization will encounter enormous difficulties, and we will not be able to complete socialist industrialization." This is indeed the case. The socialist economy must be built on the basis of modern technology. If agriculture, like industry, is not equipped with modern technology, it can only be a lame economy, and the sustained, high-speed, and proportional development of industry and the entire national economy will not be possible. Therefore, equipping agriculture with new technologies and realizing the modernization of agriculture is precisely the important content and material basis for entering a new stage of socialist construction, implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and industry supporting agriculture. It is the central link of all current work and also a glorious task of industry, especially heavy industry.

The implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and the beginning of agricultural technical transformation have also brought our worker-peasant alliance to a new stage. This is of inestimable significance for promoting socialist construction in our country and consolidating and developing the socialist system. Our worker-peasant alliance is experiencing three historical stages. The first is the stage of democratic revolution, where the working class and 500 million peasants formed a solid alliance on the basis of thoroughly implementing land reform, and achieved a complete victory in the democratic revolution. The second is the stage of socialist revolution, where the worker-peasant alliance was built on the basis of the socialist collective economy. Through agricultural cooperativization and the people's commune system, the peasants were liberated from the shackles of private ownership and completely embarked on the road of socialist public ownership. Now we are entering the third stage, which is to gradually realize the technical transformation of agriculture and realize the modernization of agriculture while continuing to develop socialist public ownership, and to build the worker-peasant alliance on the material basis of modern technology. The realization of this new historical task is not only necessary for the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural economy, but also has far-reaching significance for transforming peasants, eliminating the remnants of small-scale peasant economy ideology and private ownership concepts, and for further consolidating and developing the people's commune system, and even finally eliminating the differences between workers and peasants.

There are two steps to realizing agricultural mechanization. The first step is to first realize semi-mechanization and partial mechanization, and then further realize full mechanization. This is determined by the foundation and development speed of our country's heavy industry. At present, Guangdong must focus on vigorously developing improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and regard this as the center of agricultural technical transformation. Improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools play a great role, and are easy to obtain materials and convenient to manufacture. They are the most reliable and realistic way to improve agricultural labor productivity at present, the key to whether agriculture can continue to leap forward, and at the same time prepare conditions for the further realization of agricultural modernization in the future. Any idea or practice that simply waits for tractors, underestimates improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and adopts a laissez-faire and passive waiting attitude is extremely wrong and will seriously affect the rapid development of agricultural production.

Launching mass movements is a fundamental issue in accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. Some people believe that mass movements are needed for other things, but not for agricultural technical transformation. This is a completely wrong view. The rapid progress and good quality of farmland capital construction in Guangdong last winter and this spring were due to the relatively good development of mass-based improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools movement. Water conservancy construction is a prominent example. Last winter and this spring, 1.2 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were completed, exceeding the original plan by 71%, which was twice as much as the more than 400 million cubic meters completed in the same period last year. The main reason was that the masses were mobilized in water conservancy construction, and the mechanization of earth excavation and blasting, the motorization of earth transportation, the wharfization of earth loading, the automation of earth unloading, and the piling of earth with water were realized. We must pay close attention to the creations and inventions of the masses. Even if these creations are imperfect and are just a budding, they are worth cherishing because they have a future. We must promote the combination of leaders, the masses, and technical personnel, and the practice of summarizing experience and actual performance on the spot. This is a very good working method of the mass line. The production practice of the working masses has always been the source of the advancement of all science and technology. The mass movement in tool reform must be combined with professional manufacturing and professional experimental research. Mechanization and semi-mechanization are scientific work, and it is difficult to move forward without a scientific and professional team. All views that oppose the mass movement to the scientific and professional team are wrong.

    加速农业的技术改造
    赵紫阳
    编者按：广东“上游”第五—六期刊载了中共广东省委书记处书记赵紫阳同志的一篇文章，原题是“农业生产的新阶段”，共分三部分，下面是这篇文章第二和第三部分的摘要。
    为了迅速发展农业，必须加速农业的技术改造。当前农业生产上的主要矛盾就是农业持续跃进的需要与落后的农业工具之间的矛盾。只有加速农业的技术改造，实现农业现代化，才能够彻底解决这个矛盾。因此，加速农业的技术改造，是今后实现农业持续跃进的根本保证。
    根据马克思列宁主义原理，取得了胜利的工人阶级，必须对农业实行两种改造：一是社会改造，即用社会主义所有制去代替资本主义所有制和个体农民所有制；一是技术改造，即用现代技术去装备落后的农业。由于我们实现了合作化，又在合作化的基础上实现了人民公社化，农业的社会改造已经取得伟大的胜利。在社会改造取得伟大胜利的同时，不仅大大促进了农业生产的发展，使土地连片，创造了领导大生产的经验，而且有力地促进了工业的发展，使重工业已经有可能逐步用现代技术来装备农业，从而为农业技术改造铺平了道路。
    根据两年来大跃进的经验，要迅速发展农业生产，不仅要大力提高单位面积产量，而且要积极扩大耕地面积；不仅要大量发展粮食生产和经济作物，而且还要大量发展畜牧业、渔业和副业；还要大规模地进行农田基本建设，系统地贯彻执行“八字宪法”，以及细致地进行精耕细作等等。所有这些，说明农业生产上的用工量将越来越多。我们现在的农业劳动生产率虽然已经比过去有了一定的提高，但是还远不能适应当前农业生产必须迅速发展的需要。两年来在农业生产上劳动力的紧张状况，归根到底正是反映了这个本质的问题。解决这个问题的根本出路，就是要把落后的农业转到先进的技术基础上来。
    农业技术改造不仅是农业继续跃进的要求，同时又是工业和整个国民经济继续跃进的中心环节。有些人认为：农业技术改造只是农业部门的事情，与工业和整个国民经济的发展无关，或者害怕强调支援农业便要影响工业的发展。这些想法显然是十分错误的。毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指出：“如果我们不能在大约三个五年计划的时期内基本上解决农业合作化的问题，即农业由使用畜力农具的小规模的经营跃进到使用机器的大规模的经营，……我们就不能解决年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要同现时主要农作物一般产量很低之间的矛盾，我们的社会主义工业化事业就会遇到绝大的困难，我们就不可能完成社会主义工业化。”事实正是这样。社会主义的经济必须建立在现代技术的基础上。如果不把农业和工业一样用现代技术装备起来，这就只能是跛脚的经济，工业和整个国民经济持续地高速度按比例地发展就不可能。因此，用新式技术装备农业，实现农业的现代化，正是进入社会主义建设新阶段，执行以农业为基础的方针和工业支援农业的重要内容和物质基础，是当前一切工作的中心环节，也是工业首先是重工业的一项光荣任务。
    以农业为基础的方针的贯彻执行，农业技术改造的开始，也使我国工农联盟走上了新的阶段。这对我国社会主义建设的推进和社会主义制度的巩固和发展，具有不可估量的意义。我们的工农联盟经历着三个历史阶段。第一是民主革命阶段，工人阶级和五亿农民在彻底实行土地改革的基础上结成了巩固的联盟，取得了民主革命的全部胜利。第二是社会主义革命阶段，工农联盟建立在社会主义集体经济的基础上，经过农业合作化和人民公社化，把农民从私有制的束缚下解放出来，彻底走上了社会主义公有制的道路。现在开始进入第三个阶段，就是要在继续发展社会主义公有制的同时，逐步实现农业的技术改造，实现农业的现代化，把工农联盟建立在现代技术的物质基础之上。这一新的历史任务的实现，不仅为高速度地发展工农业经济所必需，而且对于改造农民，消除小农经济的思想和私有观念的残余，对于进一步巩固和发展人民公社制度，以至最后消灭工农差别，都有深远的意义。
    实现农业机械化分两步走。第一步先实现半机械化和部分机械化，然后再进一步实现全面机械化。这是我国重工业的基础和发展速度所决定的。当前广东省必须以大搞改良农具和半机械化农具，把这作为农业技术改造的中心。改良农具和半机械化农具的作用很大，而且取材容易，制作方便，它是现时提高农业劳动生产率最可靠最现实的途径，是农业能否继续跃进的关键，同时又为将来进一步实现农业现代化准备条件。任何单纯等待拖拉机，对改良农具和半机械化农具估计不足，采取放任自流和消极等待态度的想法和做法，都是极端错误的，都将严重影响农业生产的迅速发展。
    大搞群众运动，是加速农业技术改造的一个根本问题。有人认为其他事情需要搞群众运动，而农业技术改造则不能搞群众运动，这是完全错误的观点。去冬今春广东省农田基本建设进度快、质量好，就是由于比较好地开展了群众性的改良农具和半机械化农具运动的结果。兴修水利是突出的例子。去冬今春完成了十二亿土石方，按原计划超额完成了71％，比上年同期完成的四亿多方多了两倍，其主要原因，就是在水利施工中发动了群众，实现了挖土爆破化，运土车子化，装土码头化，卸土自动化，水桩压土化。要十分注意群众的创造和发明，这些创造即使是不完善的，是一种萌芽，也值得珍视，因为它是有发展前途的。要提倡领导、群众、技术人员三结合，到现场总结经验和实际表演的做法。这是一种很好的群众路线的工作方法。劳动群众的生产实践，从来就是一切科学技术向前发展的源泉。工具改革中的群众运动，必须与专业制造、专业试验研究相结合。机械化、半机械化是一种科学的工作，没有科学专业队伍，也是难于前进的。一切把群众运动和科学的专业队伍对立起来的观点都是错误的。
