Wheat Field Management Should Be Even Better
By People's Daily Commentator

The weather is getting warmer and warmer, and the wheat is growing very fast. Now, most of the wheat in the Yangtze River basin is pregnant with ears, the main wheat-producing areas north of the Huai River have already jointed, and the wheat in northern North China has generally turned green and begun to joint. Since the beginning of spring, in order to enable the wheat to smoothly pass the turning green and jointing stages, various regions have vigorously fought drought to water the wheat and increased the application of top dressing, and various field management tasks have been grasped early and well. Therefore, this year the wheat in various regions is characterized by "more roots, lush leaves, early turning green, and more tillers," and all are "green, strong, even, dense, and deeply rooted," and the production situation is very good.

Our task now is to advance on the crest of victory, continue to work hard to grasp the mid-term management of wheat fields, and make wheat field management even better. Strengthening mid-term wheat field management is of great significance for striving for a bumper summer harvest. Currently, it is the peak growing season for wheat. Letting the wheat seedlings "eat and drink their fill" and not be harmed by natural disasters can maximize the increase in effective tillers and enable the wheat to form a large number of ears; striving for large ears, many grains, and heavy grains of wheat can increase production even more.

Judging from the recent situation, in addition to some areas still being dry and needing to continue fighting drought, the central problem of current wheat field management is the fertilizer problem. This year's wheat has generally implemented reasonable close planting, and the number of wheat seedlings per unit area is more than in the past, so it needs more nutrients; and in the entire growth and development process of wheat, the period from jointing to heading requires the most fertilizer. In the previous stage, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields increased compared to previous years, which is a fact; however, we cannot use the old standards to measure it, but should use this year's production increase targets to measure it. Yanshi County in Henan Province is a very good example. The early-stage management of the county's more than 400,000 mu of wheat was very well grasped, with many strong seedlings, and third-class wheat only accounted for 6.7%. However, according to a recent inspection, calculated based on the general requirement of about three jin of nitrogen absorbed from the soil for every 100 jin of wheat produced, all types of wheat fields have not yet reached the planned target of producing 500 jin of wheat per mu. If we also include the wheat's need for phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, the current quantity, quality, and variety of fertilization are still far from the actual needs of the production increase target. The county has already continued to vigorously grasp wheat field top dressing based on the inspection results. These situations tell us that the fertilizer problem in wheat fields must still be universally and vigorously grasped. People's communes in various regions should conduct a thorough inspection of the fertilization of various types of wheat fields, find out the amount of fertilization and the situation of fertilizer deficiency, mobilize the masses, and vigorously carry out top dressing. The accumulated fertilizer should be quickly transported to the fields; if the fertilizer is insufficient, the masses should be quickly mobilized to make a concentrated effort to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer. Some people say that it is now the busy season for spring plowing, and there is no one to spare for making and accumulating fertilizer. Is there really no way to do it? Look at the facts in Dali County, Shaanxi Province. Recently, the county mobilized the masses to "break up every kang, collect ash in every household, make fertilizer in every factory, and search for fertilizer by everyone." In five days, they collected more than 360 million jin of old kang soil from the wall, human manure and urine, and soil fertilizer, and applied jointing fertilizer to more than 730,000 mu of wheat fields. If this county can rely on the masses to solve the fertilizer problem, other places can also solve it with effort.

Vigorously grasping top dressing and supplying sufficient nutrients to wheat is the fundamental measure to ensure that wheat grows stronger. However, this alone is not enough. It is also necessary to create favorable external conditions to protect its smooth growth, which is to prevent natural disasters. Now, the frost period has not passed, and there is still a possibility of frost in the coming period; after wheat jointing, it is also the period of large-scale development of rust disease, and there are the most pests during this period. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen preparations and do a good job in preventing frost, preventing rust, and controlling insects. The spring drought in the northern wheat-producing areas this year occurred early and covered a wide area. Due to the victorious development of the drought resistance struggle and the recent successive rainfall, the drought situation in many areas has been basically alleviated or eased, but many areas still need to continue to fight drought. All places that are currently still threatened by drought need to continue to widely dig water sources and fight drought to water the wheat. Some areas in the south have been experiencing continuous cloudy and rainy weather recently, and it is necessary to clear ditches and drain waterlogging to prevent wheat fields from being flooded.

This year, the sown area of summer harvest crops such as wheat has increased a lot nationwide, and the proportion of summer harvest crop output in the annual agricultural output has greatly increased compared to the past, and striving for a bumper summer harvest is of greater significance for completing the annual agricultural production plan. Boost greater enthusiasm, further strengthen mid-term wheat field management, and strive for an even greater wheat harvest.

### 麦田管理要好上加好

    麦田管理要好上加好	本报评论员
    天气越来越暖，麦子生长很快。现在，长江流域小麦大部孕穗，淮河以北主要产麦区小麦已经拔节，华北北部小麦普遍返青，并且开始拔节。入春以来，各地为了使麦子顺利渡过返青和拔节关，都曾大力抗旱浇麦，增施追肥，各项田间管理工作都抓得又早又好。因此，今年各地小麦都是“根多、叶茂、返青早、分蘖多”，都是“青、壮、匀、密、扎根深”，生产情况非常好。
    现在我们的任务，就是乘胜前进，继续努力大抓麦田中期管理，做到麦田管理好上加好。加强麦田中期管理，对于争取夏季大丰收具有重要意义。当前，正是小麦生长旺期，让麦苗“吃饱喝足”，不受自然灾害的损害，才能最大限度地增加有效分蘖，使小麦大量成穗；争取小麦穗大、粒多、粒重，才能更多地增产。
    从最近的情况看，除部分地区仍然干旱，需继续抗旱外，当前麦田管理的中心问题是肥料问题。今年的小麦由于普遍实行了合理密植，单位面积上的麦苗比过去多，因此需要的养分也多；而在小麦整个生长发育过程中，需肥最多的又是从拔节到抽穗这段时期。前一阶段，麦田施肥量比往年增加了，这是事实；但是，我们不能用老标准来衡量，而应该用今年的增产指标来衡量。河南省偃师县就是一个很好的例子，这个县四十多万亩小麦前期管理抓得很好，苗多苗壮，三类麦只占6.7％。但是据不久以前检查，按每生产一百斤小麦一般约需自土壤中吸收三斤氮素来计算，各类麦田都还没有达到每亩产麦五百斤的计划指标的要求。如果再把麦子对磷钾肥料的需要计算在内，则目前的施肥数量、质量和品种，距增产指标的实际需要相差还要远些。这个县已经根据检查结果，继续大抓麦田追肥。这些情况告诉我们，对于麦田的肥料问题，还必须普遍大抓狠抓。各地人民公社应该对各类麦田的施肥情况普遍进行一次深入的检查，摸清施肥数量和缺肥的情况，发动群众，大搞追肥。已经积下的肥料，赶快运到田里去；肥料不足的，赶快发动群众突击积肥、造肥。有人说，现在已是春耕大忙，拨不出人手造肥积肥了。事情真的没有办法吗？请看陕西省大荔县的事实，这个县最近发动群众，“户户打炕，家家集灰，厂厂造肥，人人搜肥”，五天之中就搜集到陈墙老炕土、人粪尿、土化肥三亿六千多万斤，给七十三万多亩麦田施了拔节肥。这个县能依靠群众解决肥料问题，别的地方经过努力同样也可以解决。
    大抓追肥，供给小麦充分的养分，是保证小麦长得更健壮的根本措施。但是，只有这一条还不够，还要从外部创造有利条件来保护它顺利成长，这就是要防御自然灾害。现在，霜冻时期还没有过去，今后一个时期仍有发生霜冻的可能；小麦拔节以后又是锈病大发展的时期，这个时期害虫也最多。所以，必须加强准备，做好防霜、防锈、治虫等工作。今年北方麦产区春旱发生得早、面也广。由于抗旱斗争的胜利发展和近来陆续降雨，许多地区的旱象已经基本解除或者有所缓和，但是不少地区还需要继续抗旱，凡是目前还在受干旱威胁的地方，需要继续广挖水源，抗旱浇麦。南方一些地区近来阴雨连绵，需要清沟排渍，防止麦田受涝。
    今年全国小麦等夏收作物播种面积增加了很多，夏收作物产量在全年农业产量中所占的比重比过去大大增加，争取夏季大丰收对于完成全年农业生产计划的意义更加重大了。鼓起更大干劲，进一步加强麦田中期管理，力争小麦更大丰收。
