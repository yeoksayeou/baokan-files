Chairman, fellow delegates:
    I wholeheartedly endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Listening to these two reports is like hearing a majestic bugle call, an epic poem of splendor, filling one with joy and cheering for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.
    1959 was a year of continued Great Leap Forward. In this year, the people of the whole country rode the wind and waves, advanced bravely, and achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts of the national economy, creating amazing miracles. Taking steel production as an example, it increased from 8 million tons to more than 13 million tons. This is not only something that old China dared not dream of, but also something that the most developed capitalist countries cannot match. In this year, agriculture suffered severe natural disasters, but under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party and the great people's leader Chairman Mao, the whole nation mobilized, went all out, and after a magnificent struggle, finally overcame the disasters, won a bumper harvest, and realized a continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. This would have caused astonishing disasters before liberation. I come from Henan, so let me talk about Henan. In 1942, Henan had only about fifty days of little rain, and the drought-affected area was more than 50 million mu, but at that time, the land was barren for thousands of miles, and there was no harvest. More than 3 million people starved to death, and more than 10 million people left their homes, selling their children. In 1959, the length of the drought and the extent of the area far exceeded that of 1942. However, 1959 achieved a great harvest on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest of 1958. The total agricultural output value increased by 21.9% compared to 1958, and grain increased by 13.75%. This is an unprecedented miracle.
    What strength did we rely on to overcome such disasters and achieve such great results? This is not accidental. This is because the Party's General Line for socialist construction has taken root in the hearts of the people, because the Great Leap Forward has accumulated rich experience, and because the People's Communes have demonstrated tremendous superiority. In short, it is the victory of the three magic weapons of the Party in the period of socialist construction, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    If we look around at the excellent situation of the national economy, we will see the infinitely good prospects of the motherland, and we will feel unparalleled excitement and joy. In this new historical period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, with the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will surely be able to lead us from victory to greater victory. In this great decade of the sixties, as long as we persist in using the three magic weapons, we will surely be able to build the mountains and rivers of our motherland more beautifully and richly. A great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture will surely appear in the East of the earth. Look, by that time, let the trembling imperialists tremble even more!
    In this new revolutionary situation, what should people like me, who are not very old nor very young, do? To put it bluntly, we should catch up, not fall behind, and not think that we are old and cannot do it, and develop twilight thoughts. I used to have this kind of thought, which is not good. It has a negative effect on transformation and service and is detrimental to the socialist cause. I have seen many people older than me who are full of confidence, full of vitality, and doing everything possible to contribute to socialism. How can I be willing to lag behind? No, I must also catch up, resolutely transform myself, and contribute my remaining light and warmth to the cause of socialist construction. This will make me feel the greatest glory.

### 决不服老  贺升平代表的发言

    决不服老
    贺升平代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我竭诚拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。听了这两个报告，就像听了雄壮的号角，瑰丽的史诗，使人兴高彩烈，为总路线、大跃进、人民公社而欢呼。
    1959年是继续大跃进的一年。就在这一年，全国人民乘风破浪，奋勇前进，在国民经济各个战线上取得了辉煌成就，创造出惊人奇迹。拿钢铁产量来说，由八百万吨增加到一千三百多万吨。这不仅旧中国不敢梦想，就是最发达的资本主义国家也望尘莫及。就在这一年，农业受到严重自然灾害，但是，在伟大的共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席的英明领导下，全民动员，鼓足干劲，经过一场气壮山河的搏斗，终于战胜灾害，夺得丰收，实现农业生产继续大跃进。这在解放前，一定造成灾害惊人。我来自河南，且谈河南事。1942年，河南仅五十天左右少雨，受旱面积五千多万亩，但当时，赤地千里，颗粒无收，饿死三百多万人，一千多万人背井离乡，卖儿卖女。1959年，干旱时间之长，面积之广，远远超过1942年。但是，1959年却在1958年特大丰收的基础上，又取得了大丰收。农业总产值比1958年增长21.9％，粮食增长13.75％。这是从古未有的奇迹。
    我们凭什么力量战胜这样的灾害，取得这样大的成绩呢？这不是偶然的。这是由于党的社会主义建设总路线深入人心，由于大跃进积累了丰富经验，由于人民公社发挥了巨大优越性。总括一句话，是党在社会主义建设时期三大法宝的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们环顾一下国民经济的大好形势，就会看到祖国无限好的前景，就会感到无比的兴奋和欢乐。在这社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的历史时期，有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，一定能够把我们从胜利引向更大胜利。在这伟大的六十年代里，我们只要坚持运用三大法宝，一定能够把祖国河山建造的更加美丽富饶。一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，一定能在地球的东方出现。看，到了那时，让正在颤抖着的帝国主义，更加颤抖吧！
    在这新的革命形势下，像我这年纪不算很大，也不算很小的人，怎么办呢？干脆说，应该赶上去，不能落在后边，不能以为年纪大，不行了，产生黄昏思想。过去我有这种思想，这是不好的，它对改造、服务都起着消极作用，对社会主义事业不利。我看到许多比我年纪大的人，他们都满怀信心，充满活力，千方百计，为社会主义贡献力量。我怎么能甘居落伍呢？不能，我也要赶上去，坚决改造自己，把自己的余光微热，都要贡献于社会主义建设事业。这将会使我感到最大的光荣。
