Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st - Encouraged by the slogan "Strive to basically achieve mechanized rice transplantation this year," Guizhou is experiencing a high tide of spring plowing tool reform centered on the manufacture, use, and promotion of rice transplanters. A new trend of "every commune rushes to manufacture rice transplanters, everyone competes to be a rice transplanter operator" has emerged in the rural areas of the province. Currently, more than 260,000 new rice transplanters have been manufactured, completing more than 90% of the plans self-determined by each special district (autonomous prefecture, city). Tongren County, which initiated the proposal to achieve rice transplanter mechanization this spring, completed 109% of its manufacturing plan as early as March 5th, and 90% of its paddy fields can be transplanted by machine.

Rice is Guizhou's staple food. Large-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters can greatly improve labor productivity, ensure timely transplantation according to the season, and ensure uniform and appropriate depth of transplantation, which has a very significant effect on striving for increased rice production. Last year, the province promoted more than 60,000 rice transplanters. According to last year's experience, using rice transplanters generally improves work efficiency by two to three times to five to six times compared to manual transplanting, with yield increases generally ranging from 5% to 20%. Due to the success of promoting and using rice transplanters last year, the superiority of machine transplanting has become increasingly popular. Therefore, after Tongren County proposed achieving rice transplanter mechanization at the beginning of this spring, various places responded enthusiastically. Party committee secretaries personally took charge, going to factories to manufacture and to fields to operate, driving the masses to vigorously promote rice transplanters. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500,000 commune members throughout the province have been involved in the manufacture and promotion of rice transplanters. After the manufacturing and promotion plans for more than 300,000 rice transplanters are completed, the province will basically achieve mechanized rice transplantation, saving more than 18 million labor days in rice transplantation.

In the rush to manufacture rice transplanters, various places, based on last year's experience, loudly put forward the slogan of "Quality First," requiring that manufacturing must meet specifications. To this end, various places have universally adopted methods such as short-term training to teach workers the technology of manufacturing, repairing, and using rice transplanters. Various places have also generally adopted the method of assigning factories, quality, quantity, and time according to the technical strength of the agricultural implement factories at all levels to rush to manufacture rice transplanters, and have universally established a responsibility system. At the same time, industrial, agricultural, commercial and other relevant departments were promptly organized to go deep into the factories for joint inspection and strict acceptance signed off on quality. The more than 250 rice transplanters produced by Jiangkou Commune in Tongren County, after on-site use and inspection, all met the specifications of consistent specifications, consistent opening and closing of seedling clips, consistent row spacing, and lightness and durability. More than 11,000 newly manufactured rice transplanters in Meitan County, after acceptance, basically met the quality standards and were very popular among the masses. The simple rice transplanters newly manufactured throughout the province generally meet the requirements of dense planting specifications.

In the rush to manufacture rice transplanters, the principle of using local materials and solving problems locally was adhered to, and the masses were fully mobilized to adopt methods such as finding, clearing (warehouses), collecting (purchasing), producing (production), and substituting to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials for manufacturing rice transplanters through self-reliance. Industrial departments provided strong support in terms of raw materials, materials, and technology; commercial departments provided timely strong support in the allocation of bamboo, wood, iron nails, and other materials, as well as the requisition and sales of finished products.

While vigorously manufacturing rice transplanters, the province adopted methods such as opening training classes, organizing on-site visits, learning from experience, teaching in the fields, and experienced workers leading new workers, guaranteeing teaching and learning, and trained more than 396,000 rice transplanter operators, accounting for 64% of the planned number, most of whom have been able to explain, use, and repair the machines.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st - Rushing before transplanting, not falling behind after transplanting. Jiangxi is launching a blitz campaign to manufacture and promote rice transplanters, striving to complete the manufacturing and promotion plan of 130,000 rice transplanters before transplanting, ensuring that 60% of the province's early rice is transplanted by machine.

Currently, 50,000 professional troops have been concentrated throughout the province to rush to manufacture rice transplanters. In this blitz campaign, leading cadres of counties, communes, and factories have personally taken charge, going deep into the front line of production, leading workers to break through various difficulties with a spirit of continuous revolution, and further improve and upgrade rice transplanters. Yiyang County, while accelerating the mass production of the "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter, iron factory and woodworking factory workers painstakingly studied the principle of sewing machine needle tube lifting and lowering, and created and promoted a rapid automatic rice transplanter. This rice transplanter does not require pressing once for each planting; it can automatically transplant as long as it is pulled forward; the transplanting is straight, the seedlings are evenly separated, and it can transplant 20 to 40 mu per day, increasing the efficiency of the "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter by three to six times or more, and is generally welcomed by the masses. The county and commune agricultural implement factories in Jinxian County, with leaders offering ideas and thousands of skilled craftsmen contributing suggestions and designs, launched a vigorous innovation campaign. On the basis of the original "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter, further improvements were made, changing most of the iron parts of the machine body to wooden structures, reducing the amount of pig iron used per rice transplanter from 15.8 kilograms to 5.4 kilograms, and reducing the number of screws from 182 to 22, saving two-thirds of the steel materials and reducing the cost by nearly half. This not only greatly accelerated the manufacturing speed, but also greatly improved the quality. This rice transplanter was named "59 Type Jinxian." Currently, more than 2,000 such rice transplanters have been manufactured in the county, approaching the completion of all production tasks.

Large factories helping small factories and cooperation everywhere is a common style in the blitz manufacturing of rice transplanters. Many urban factories that do not produce rice transplanters, under the slogan of "Everyone supports rice transplanters," tried every possible means to free up manpower and materials to help county and commune factories rush to manufacture rice transplanters. Seven factories and enterprises in Jiujiang City established cooperative relationships with ten communes and reclamation farms in the city. The city brush factory took out 500 jin of steel wire to support the commune factories as seedling curtains, and undertook the processing task of the palm brush boards for 1,800 rice transplanters in the city. Yihuang County lacked technology and equipment, and the factories in Fuzhou City took the initiative to sign a contract for processing rice transplanters with materials supplied by Yihuang County. In addition, many counties and communes in mountainous areas, in the great cooperation, supported the counties and communes in the plains with a large amount of timber and mao bamboo based on the principle of equivalent exchange, helping to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials for rushing to manufacture rice transplanters.

While vigorously grasping the blitz manufacturing of rice transplanters, various places also vigorously grasped the promotion and use. In order to ensure the quality of rice transplanters, various places have established a strict product acceptance system, accepting one for each one that leaves the factory, ensuring that each rice transplanter sent to commune members meets the specifications, is of excellent quality, and is easy to use. At the same time, various places from the county to the commune have also held a large number of rice transplanter operator training classes. Currently, more than 100,000 commune members throughout the province have participated in the training. Before early rice transplanting, there will be two to three rice transplanter operators for each rice transplanter.

    新造插秧机二十多万部　培训插秧机手三十多万名
    贵州今年基本实现插秧机具化
    江西能工巧匠创造快速插秧机，每天能插秧二十到四十亩
    据新华社贵阳31日电　贵州各地在“力争今年基本实现水稻插秧机化”的口号鼓舞下，掀起了一个以制造、使用和推广插秧机为中心的春耕工具改革高潮，全省农村普遍出现了“社社赶造插秧机、人人争当秧机手”的新风气。现在全省新造的插秧机已达二十六万多部，完成了各专区（州、市）自订计划的90％以上，向全省发起今春实现插秧机化倡议的铜仁县，早在3月5日就完成了制造计划的109％，90％的稻田可实现机插。
    水稻是贵州的主粮。大面积推广使用插秧机，能大大提高劳动生产率，保证按季节插秧，并能插得均匀和深浅适宜，对争取水稻增产有极为重大的作用。去年全省就已推广了六万多部插秧机，根据去年经验，使用插秧机插秧，一般比手插要提高工效两、三倍至五、六倍，增产幅度一般在5％到20％。由于去年推广使用插秧机获得了成功，机插的优越性已愈来愈深入人心。因此，今年春初铜仁县倡议实现插秧机化以后，各地热烈响应，党委书记亲自挂帅，下厂制造，下田操作，带动群众大搞插秧机。据不完全统计，全省投入制造和推广插秧机的社员已达五十多万人。三十多万部插秧机的制造、推广计划全部完成后，全省即可基本实现水稻插秧机化，在水稻插秧中将可节省一千八百多万个劳动日。
    各地在赶制插秧机中，根据去年经验，响亮地提出了“质量第一”的口号，要求制造必须符合规格。为此，各地都普遍地采取短期训练等方式，向工人传授制造、修理、使用插秧机的技术。各地还根据各级农具厂的技术力量，一般采取了定厂、定质、定量、定时的办法赶造插秧机，并且普遍建立了责任制，同时及时组织工业、农业、商业等有关部门深入到厂，联合检查，严格按质量签字验收。铜仁县江口公社出厂的二百五十多部插秧机，经过实地使用、检验，全部达到了规格一致、秧夹张开合拢一致、窝距一致、轻便耐用一致。湄潭县新制的一万一千多部插秧机，经过验收，基本上达到了质量标准，很受群众欢迎。全省新造出的简易插秧机，一般都符合密植规格的要求。
    各地在赶制插秧机中还坚持了就地取材、就地解决的原则，充分发动群众，采取找、清（仓库）、收（购）、产（生产）、代（替）等办法，自力更生解决了制造插秧机的原料不足问题。工业部门在原料、材料、技术上；商业部门对竹、木、铁钉等材料的调拨和成品调用推销上，都及时进行了大力支援。
    全省在大造插秧机的同时，采取了开办训练班、组织现场参观、献经取宝、临田教学，以及熟手带新手、包教保学等办法，培养训练了插秧机手三十九万六千多人，占计划数的64％，其中绝大部分都做到了会讲解、会使用、会修理。
    据新华社南昌31日电　赶在插秧前，不落插秧后。江西各地展开制造和推广插秧机的突击运动。力争插秧以前胜利完成十三万部插秧机的制造和推广计划，保证全省60％的早稻实现插秧机化。
    现在全省各地已集中五万专业大军赶制插秧机。在这个突击运动中，各县、公社和工厂的领导干部都亲自挂帅，深入生产第一线，领导工人以不断革命精神，破除各种难关，进一步改进和提高插秧机。弋阳县在加速大造“江西五九型”插秧机的同时，铁工厂和木工厂工人根据缝纫机针管升降的原理刻苦钻研，创造、推广了一种快速自动插秧机。这种插秧机使用时不需要插一次按一次，只要向前拉动就可以自动插秧；插秧直、分秧匀，每天能插秧二十到四十亩，比“江西五九型”插秧机工效提高三至六倍以上，得到群众普遍欢迎。进贤县县、社农具厂，领导出主意，千名能工巧匠献策设计，大闹革新，在原来“江西五九型”插秧机的基础上进一步改进，将机身大部铁件改为木料结构，使每部插秧机所用生铁由十五点八公斤减少到五点四公斤，螺丝由一百八十二个减少到二十二个，节省钢铁材料三分之二，降低成本近一半。这样，不仅大大加快了制造速度，质量也有很大提高。这种插秧机被命名为“五九型进贤号”。现在全县已突击制成这种插秧机二千多部，接近完成了全部生产任务。
    大厂帮小厂、处处搞协作，是突击制造插秧机运动中普遍的风尚。许多不生产插秧机的城市工厂，在“人人支援插秧机”的口号下，千方百计腾出人力、物力帮助县、社工厂赶制插秧机。九江市七个工厂、企业分别与全市的十个公社和垦殖场建立了协作关系。市制刷厂拿出五百斤钢丝支援各公社工厂作秧帘，并承担了全市一千八百部插秧机的棕刷板的加工任务。宜黄县技术和设备不足，抚州市各工厂就主动与宜黄县订立了插秧机的来料加工合同。此外，许多山区的县、社在大协作中，根据等价交换的原则，支援了平原地区县、社大量木材、毛竹，帮助解决了赶制插秧机的原料材料不足的困难。
    各地在大抓插秧机突击制造的同时，还狠抓推广使用。为了保证插秧机质量，各地都建立了严格的产品验收制度，出厂一部验收一部，做到送到社员手里的插秧机部部合规格、优质量、好使用。同时，各地从县到社还大量举办了插秧机手训练班，现在全省已有十多万社员参加了训练。早稻插秧前将达到每部插秧机有二至三名插秧机手。
