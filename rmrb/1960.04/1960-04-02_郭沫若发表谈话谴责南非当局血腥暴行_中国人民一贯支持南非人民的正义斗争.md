Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, issued a statement on March 30 regarding the struggle of the South African people against the "Pass Laws," stating that the Chinese people consistently support the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and persecution, and for basic human rights and freedom. He expressed his firm belief that final victory will surely belong to the heroic South African people and the entire African people.

The full text of Guo Moruo's statement is as follows:

"The authorities of the Union of South Africa, who have consistently pursued a policy of racial discrimination, have recently intensified their actions and have used extremely barbaric means to massacre African people who oppose the 'Pass Laws.' This new bloody crime committed by the colonialists in order to continue to enslave, oppress, and exploit the African people has met with even larger-scale opposition from the South African people and more severe protests from world public opinion.

"The broad masses of African people who are unwilling to continue to be ruled by colonialism and enslaved by imperialism have stood up. The long-term, unyielding struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination and persecution, and for basic human rights and freedom, is entirely just. The Chinese people have consistently supported the just struggle of the South African people. We firmly believe that no matter what means the colonialists use to suppress or what conspiracies and tricks they use to deceive, they cannot shake the determination of the African people to strive for independence and freedom. We also firmly believe that the united South African people, with the support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people throughout the world, will persevere in their struggle until the 'Pass Laws' are completely abolished and the system of racial discrimination and colonialism is buried! Final victory will surely belong to the heroic South African people and the entire African people!"

    郭沫若发表谈话谴责南非当局血腥暴行
    中国人民一贯支持南非人民的正义斗争
    新华社1日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若3月30日就南非人民反对“通行证法”的斗争发表谈话说，中国人民一贯支持南非人民反对种族歧视和迫害、争取基本人权和自由的斗争。他表示深信，最后胜利一定属于英勇的南非和整个非洲人民。
    郭沫若谈话的全文如下：
    “一贯奉行种族歧视政策的南非联邦当局，最近竟变本加厉地用极其野蛮的手段，大肆屠杀反对‘通行证法’的非洲人民。殖民主义者为了继续奴役、压迫、剥削非洲人民所犯下的这一新的血腥罪行，遭到了南非人民更大规模的反对和世界舆论更严厉的抗议。
    “不愿继续受殖民主义统治和帝国主义奴役的广大非洲人民，已经站起来了。南非人民长期以来不屈不挠地进行着反对种族歧视和迫害、争取基本人权和自由的斗争，是完全正义的。中国人民一贯支持南非人民的正义斗争。我们深信，殖民主义者不管用什么手段镇压或用什么阴谋诡计进行欺骗，都动摇不了非洲人民争取独立和自由的决心。我们也深信，团结起来的南非人民，在全世界爱好和平和维护正义的人民的支持下，必将坚持斗争，直到彻底废除‘通行证法’，埋葬掉种族歧视和殖民主义制度！最后胜利一定属于英勇的南非和整个非洲人民！”
