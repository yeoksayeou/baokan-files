Through this inspection of Shanghai's light and textile industries, I received a vivid and profound education on the General Line. We saw that in every factory, workers were enthusiastically engaged in mechanization, automation, and "one-dragon" production. Jade carving, which had been done by hand for thousands of years, is now mostly mechanized; making biscuits and toothpaste, etc., are all "one-dragon," meaning that raw materials are fed into one end of the machine, and the finished, packaged products come out the other end. These ingenious automated machines were all made by the workers overcoming various difficulties and using waste and old materials. On the wall of one factory, we saw this poem: "Difficulties are eggs, drive is Mount Tai, eggs bumping into Mount Tai, they are finished with one bump." What a great spirit! We also saw workers with less than junior high school education scaling the peaks of scientific advancement and creating world-class machines. In the past, we old intellectuals often looked down on the working people, thinking they were "roughnecks," but this inspection made me admire the wisdom and perseverance of the working class from the bottom of my heart. The Chinese working class is indeed our leading class.

Through this inspection, we felt very excited. We saw that technological innovation and revolution have made China straddle the dragon's back and fly straight to the heavens. We believe that it is no problem for us to catch up with and surpass England within ten years. In the past, some of us doubted whether more, faster, better, and more economical could be achieved, and whether we could sustain the leap forward, but the countless facts we have seen today prove that it is entirely possible to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and that we will definitely be able to sustain the leap forward.

These technological innovation and revolution projects we have seen are all flowers bloomed and fruits borne by Mao Zedong Thought. We deeply realize that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can unleash unparalleled power. What we see today is just a beginning. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the infinite potential and wisdom of the 600 million Chinese people have just begun to be unleashed, and this power is many times greater than the power of atomic energy. The leap forward of the Chinese people today is not only for building socialism but also for laying the foundation for the transition to communism. China's future is infinitely bright, and I deeply feel that it is truly a great happiness to be a Chinese person in the era of Mao Zedong.

I lived in the United States for quite a long time. During the inspection, I often thought that today's American workers could not possibly be as engrossed and exhilarated as our Chinese workers in engaging in mechanization and automation because automated machines have already caused a large number of American workers to lose their jobs. Last year, there were many worker strikes in the United States to oppose capitalists adopting automated machines. Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The contradictions in capitalist society are manifested as fierce antagonism and conflict, as fierce class struggle. Such contradictions cannot be resolved by the capitalist system itself, but only by socialist revolution." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The socialist system has promoted the rapid development of our country's productive forces. Even foreign enemies cannot but admit this." The fact that the working people of our country are today engaging in a mass movement of technological innovation and revolution with the force of a storm and the momentum of overturning mountains and seas powerfully proves Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment and also powerfully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

However, the moribund and dying imperialism is not reconciled to its inevitable death, and it is still making a dying struggle. Today, in addition to carrying out aggression against us in military, political, and other aspects, American imperialism is also attempting to use bourgeois ideology to corrupt us, especially our bourgeois intellectuals. Ten years ago, Acheson admitted in his notorious "White Paper" that American imperialism placed its hope of subverting socialist New China on "democratic individualists." This is worthy of special vigilance on the part of us intellectuals, and it also illustrates the importance and necessity of strengthening self-remolding for bourgeois intellectuals today.

Participating in Socialist Construction Requires Accepting the Leadership of the Party

I used to be a "democratic liberal." I studied in church schools from an early age. American imperialists in religious disguise instilled in me a brain full of pro-American, worship-American, and democratic-liberal individualist thoughts and habits through subtle and petty favors. Although I participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, at that time I only hated Japanese imperialism and did not hate American imperialism, and I even regarded American imperialism as a "friend."

Looking back on the decade since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, through the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, and through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity, I began to realize that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of our Chinese people. Through denunciations, a large number of criminal evidences of American imperialism using Christianity to invade China were exposed, which made me realize that American imperialism is a jackal in sheep's clothing. In today's situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, American imperialism still wants to use the conspiracy of "false peace, true war preparations" to deceive and divide the people of the world, but in fact, it still occupies our territory Taiwan, it has revived Japanese and West German militarism, and it threatens the national independence movements of Cuba and the entire Latin American people with military and economic aggression. The people of the world hate American imperialism, and it has become a "street rat" that everyone shouts at. I believe that American imperialism is more vicious and hateful than Japanese imperialism. In today's situation where socialist forces have surpassed imperialist forces, it will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat than Japanese imperialism. My pro-American and worship-American thoughts have today turned into thoughts of hating and despising American imperialism.

Through the rectification and anti-rightist movement and socialist education, I clearly realized the importance of the fact that we intellectuals must accept the leadership of the Party. In the past, I did not understand this truth. I thought, since the Chinese Communist Party and I were friends during the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and we had an equal relationship, why should the Communist Party lead me, this friend, after liberation? I didn't say it, but I was very unconvinced in my heart. During the rectification and anti-rightist movement, I understood this problem in this way: China must take the socialist road, because socialism is the road to light, and China cannot take the capitalist road, because the capitalist road is a dead end; since China must take the socialist road, and everyone must participate in socialist construction, they must accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, I participated in the study of political theory organized by the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, especially the study of the history of the Chinese revolution, which gave me a clearer and more definite understanding of the Party's leadership. From the Opium War to the Xinhai Revolution, the heroic Chinese people fought countless battles against imperialism and feudalism, one after another, but because they lacked the leadership of the proletariat, they all failed. Only after the Chinese proletariat and its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party—appeared on the stage of Chinese history, especially under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, did the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle begin to move from victory to greater victory, all the way to the liberation of the whole of China, and under the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, socialist construction was carried out at a high speed. Facts speak louder than words. The historical facts of China in the past century prove that patriotic intellectuals must accept the leadership of the Party in order to make contributions to the great construction of the motherland. On the issue of the Party's leadership, I am now completely convinced.

Revolutionizing Bourgeois Individualism and Throwing Oneself into the Great Cause of Socialist Construction

Two years ago, I also participated in the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference's study on "Making Bourgeois Individualism Stink," and began to realize that individualism is a bourgeois thing, is quite smelly, and is undesirable. Recently, in participating in the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference's study of the General Line and transforming the world outlook, I realized that in carrying out socialist construction, we not only need to carry out economic revolution, political revolution, technological revolution, and cultural revolution, but also need to change our own world outlook and carry out ideological revolution. We bourgeois intellectuals must strengthen self-remolding, otherwise we will drag the socialist construction of the country back. And upon examination, my biggest problem is still bourgeois individualism.

Bourgeois individualism is quite deeply rooted in my thinking. This is a poisonous weed that the old society and imperialism planted in my mind for decades. It occupies a legal position in my thinking and issues orders to me. In the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, my personal heroism was very serious, and I overestimated my own role. After liberation, I still carried a rather heavy "progressive burden." It was not until the rectification and anti-rightist movement that I criticized personal heroism and laid down the "progressive burden." Today, when we are carrying out socialist construction, I know that bourgeois individualism is illegal and smelly, but it is still hiding in the depths of my soul and occupying it without leaving. I think that in today's process of ideological remolding and transforming the world outlook, I must first attack my own bourgeois individualism and dig up this poisonous weed. I know that socialism is good, and I also praise socialism. The great socialist construction achievements of the motherland make me happy and inspired; I also know that capitalism in the world will surely perish, and will perish soon, and that the objective law of historical development is that the whole world will surely move towards socialism and communism. But when encountering specific problems, the bourgeois ghost—bourgeois individualism—hiding inside me will make trouble. When the Party and Chairman Mao put forward the General Line, I doubted whether more, faster, better, and more economical could be achieved. When the situation of the Great Leap Forward appeared, I was afraid that this would be too tense. When the People's Commune appeared, I did not embrace a welcoming attitude, but first worried about what my house would be like, whether I would be accustomed to the food in the cafeteria, and so on. I approve of socialism, but I like to live a "free" life and am afraid of living a collective life. I admire, and am even moved by, the selfless spirit of the working class, but I often forget this "small self" and always consider my own gains and losses first, while placing the interests of the country and the nation in a secondary position. Bourgeois individualism has dragged me back, making me only hold an appreciative attitude towards socialism, but without the courage to throw myself into the great cause of socialist construction in the motherland, which is surging forward and leaping forward. Bourgeois individualism is really something that harms oneself and others. A situation like mine cannot be maintained for long. I want to move forward, not backward. I want to transform my world outlook, and I want to revolutionize the life of bourgeois individualism. Today, our country's mountains are changing, the waters are changing, the countryside is changing, the cities are changing, and I, this bourgeois intellectual, must also change. Today, I am raising this issue in this way to express my determination to break with the bourgeois world outlook and individualism. This is an arduous struggle. I want to study Mao Zedong Thought, I want to plant the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in my mind to drive away the evil ghost of bourgeois individualism. I want to participate in labor training and social practice to strengthen self-remolding, and learn from workers and peasants. I hope that comrades and friends will help me complete this ideological revolution. I am willing to melt myself into the socialist collective, be a small screw, and contribute my share of strength and shine my share of light for the great socialist and communist cause of the motherland. This will be the greatest glory of my life. Finally, I want to shout:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!

### 加强自我改造跟上跃进形势  刘良模委员的发言

    加强自我改造跟上跃进形势
    刘良模委员的发言
    通过这一次视察上海的轻工业和纺织工业，我受到了一次很生动、很深刻的总路线教育。我们看见，在各个工厂里，工人们都在热火朝天地大搞机械化、自动化、“一条龙”。几千年来用手工操作的玉石雕刻，现在已经绝大部分机械化了；做饼干、做牙膏等等都已经是“一条龙”，那就是说：原料从机器这一头装进去，从机器那一头出来的是已经制造好的，包装好的成品。这些灵巧的自动化机器都是工人们克服了种种困难，利用废料旧料造出来的。在一个工厂的墙上我们看见这样一首诗：“困难是鸡蛋，干劲是泰山，鸡蛋碰泰山，一碰就完蛋。”这是何等伟大的气魄！我们也看见不够初中程度的工人们攀登了科学尖端的高峰，造出了世界第一流的机器。我们旧知识分子过去往往看不起劳动人民，以为他们是“老粗”，但是这一次视察使我从心底里佩服工人阶级的智慧和毅力。中国工人阶级的确是我们的领导阶级。
    通过这一次视察，我们感到非常兴奋。我们看到技术革新和技术革命已经使中国跨上了龙背，直向高天飞去。我们认为我们要在十年内赶上并超过英国是不成问题的。过去我们有些人对于多快是否能够好省，对于我们能否持续跃进，有过怀疑，而今天我们看到的无数事实证明，多快好省地建设社会主义完全可能，并且我们一定能够持续跃进。
    我们所看见的这些技术革新和技术革命项目都是毛泽东思想所开的花，所结的果。我们深深地体会到，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就能发出无比的威力来。我们今天所看到的仅仅是一个开端。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，六亿中国人民无穷的潜力和智慧还刚刚发挥出来，这个力量比原子能的力量要大不知多少倍。我们中国人民今天的跃进，不但是为了建设社会主义，也是为过渡到共产主义打下基础。我们中国的前途是无限光明的，我深深感到，做一个毛泽东时代的中国人真是非常幸福的。
    我曾经在美国住过相当长一个时期，在视察的时候，我常常想，今天的美国工人就不可能像我们中国工人这样废寝忘食、兴高采烈地搞机械化、自动化，因为自动化机器已经使大量的美国工人失业。去年美国有不少工人罢工，就是为了反对资本家采用自动化机器。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这篇文章中指出：“资本主义社会的矛盾表现为剧烈的对抗和冲突，表现为剧烈的阶级斗争，那种矛盾不可能由资本主义制度本身来解决，而只有社会主义革命才能够加以解决。”毛主席同时指出：“社会主义制度促进了我国生产力的突飞猛进的发展，这一点，甚至连国外的敌人也不能不承认了。”我们今天全国劳动人民以暴风骤雨、排山倒海之势，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动的这个事实，有力地证明了毛主席的这个英明论断，也有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    可是日薄西山、奄奄一息的帝国主义还不甘心于它的必然死亡，它还在作垂死的挣扎。今天美帝国主义除了在军事、政治等等方面向我们进行侵略之外，还企图用资产阶级思想来腐蚀我们，特别是我们资产阶级知识分子。十年前，艾奇逊就在他那臭名远扬的“白皮书”里承认，美帝国主义把颠复社会主义新中国的希望寄托在“民主个人主义者”身上。这是值得我们知识分子特别警惕的，同时也说明了今天资产阶级知识分子要加强自我改造的重要性和必要性。
    参加社会主义建设必须接受党的领导
    我曾经是一个“民主自由主义者”，从小在教会学校里念书。披了宗教外衣的美帝国主义分子，用潜移默化小恩小惠的方法灌输了我一脑子的亲美崇美和民主自由个人主义的思想和生活习惯。我虽然参加过抗日救亡运动，但是我那个时候只恨日本帝国主义，不恨美帝国主义，而且还把美帝国主义当作“朋友”。
    回顾解放后的十年来，在党的领导下，通过抗美援朝运动，通过中国基督教三自爱国运动，我开始认识美帝国主义是我们中国人民最凶恶的敌人。通过控诉，揭发了美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国的大量罪证，使我认识美帝国主义是披着羊皮的豺狼。在东风压倒西风的今天，美帝国主义还想用“假和平、真备战”的阴谋来欺骗和分化世界人民，但是事实上，它还霸占着我国领土台湾，它复活了日本和西德军国主义，它用军事和经济侵略威胁着古巴和整个拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动。全世界人民痛恨美帝国主义，它已经变成人人喊打的“过街老鼠”。我认为美帝国主义比日本帝国主义更恶毒、更可恨。在今天社会主义力量已经超过帝国主义力量的形势下，它必将遭到比日本帝国主义更可耻的失败。我的亲美崇美思想，今天已经变成仇视美帝国主义、鄙视美帝国主义的思想。
    通过整风、反右运动和社会主义教育，使我明确地认识了我们知识分子必须要接受党的领导这个重要问题。在过去，我不明白这个道理。我想，既然在抗日救亡运动的时候，中国共产党和我是朋友，是平等的关系，为什么解放以后，共产党却要来领导我这个朋友呢？我嘴里不讲，心里很不服气。在整风、反右运动当中，我对于这个问题是这样认识的：中国必须走社会主义道路，因为社会主义是光明大道，中国不能走资本主义道路，因为资本主义道路是死路一条；既然中国必须走社会主义道路，大家必须参加社会主义建设，就必须接受中国共产党的领导。最近我参加上海市政协所组织的政治理论学习，特别是中国革命史的学习，使我对党的领导有了更清楚、更明确的认识。从鸦片战争到辛亥革命，英勇的中国人民前仆后继地向帝国主义和封建主义作了无数次的斗争，可是由于没有无产阶级的领导，都失败了。只有在中国无产阶级和它的先锋队——中国共产党出现在中国历史舞台上以后，特别是在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民的反帝反封建斗争才开始从胜利走向更大的胜利，一直到全中国得到解放，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗下，高速度地进行社会主义建设。事实胜于雄辩。中国近百年的历史事实证明，爱国的知识分子要对祖国的伟大建设有所贡献，必须要接受党的领导。对于党的领导这个问题，现在我口服心服。
    革掉资产阶级个人主义，投身到伟大的社会主义建设事业中
    两年前，我又参加了上海市政协的关于“搞臭资产阶级个人主义”的学习，开始认识个人主义是资产阶级的东西，是相当臭的，是要不得的。最近我在参加上海市政协的总路线和改造世界观的学习当中，认识到在我们进行社会主义建设的时候，我们不但需要进行经济革命、政治革命、技术革命和文化革命，而且也需要改变自己的世界观，进行思想革命。我们资产阶级知识分子必须加强自我改造，否则我们就会拖国家社会主义建设的后腿。而检查起来，我最大的毛病还是资产阶级个人主义。
    资产阶级个人主义在我思想里面是相当根深蒂固的，这是旧社会和帝国主义用几十年功夫种在我脑子里面的一棵毒草。它以合法的地位盘据在我的思想里，对我发号施令。在抗日救亡运动里面，我的个人英雄主义很严重，我曾过高地估计了自己的作用。解放以后，我还背了一个相当沉重的“进步包袱”，到整风、反右运动当中，我才批判了个人英雄主义，放下了“进步包袱”。到了进行社会主义建设的今天，我知道资产阶级个人主义是非法的，是臭的，可是它还躲在我的灵魂深处，盘据不走。我想在今天进行思想改造和改造世界观的过程中，我首先必须向我自己的资产阶级个人主义开刀，挖掉这棵毒草。我知道社会主义好，我也赞扬社会主义，祖国伟大的社会主义建设成就使我欢欣鼓舞；我也知道世界上的资本主义一定要灭亡，而且很快就要灭亡，全世界一定要走向社会主义和共产主义的这个历史发展的客观规律。可是在遇到具体问题的时候，躲在我里面的这个资产阶级的鬼——资产阶级个人主义就要作怪。在党和毛主席提出总路线的时候，我就怀疑多快是否能够好省。在大跃进形势出现的时候，我就怕这样是不是会太紧张。在人民公社出现的时候，我抱的不是欢迎的态度，而是首先担心自己住的房子怎么样，食堂的饭是否吃得惯等等。我赞成社会主义，可是我喜欢过“自由”的生活，怕过集体生活。对工人阶级的忘我精神我很佩服，甚至感动，可是我就常常忘不了这个“小我”，考虑问题总要先考虑自己的得失，而把国家民族的利益放在次要的地位。资产阶级个人主义拖住了我的后腿，使我对社会主义只抱欣赏的态度，而没有勇气投身到祖国汹涌澎湃、飞跃前进的社会主义建设的伟大事业中去。资产阶级个人主义实在是个害人害己的东西。像我这样的情况不可能长久保持下去，我要前进，不要后退。我要改造自己的世界观，我要革掉资产阶级个人主义的命。今天我们祖国的山在改变，水在改变，农村在改变，城市在改变，我这个资产阶级知识分子也必须改变。今天我把这个问题这样提出来，表示我要破掉资产阶级世界观和个人主义的决心。这是一个艰巨的斗争。我要学习毛泽东思想，我要把毛泽东思想这面红旗插在我的脑子里面，来赶走资产阶级个人主义这个恶鬼。我要参加劳动锻炼和社会实践来加强自我改造，向工人农民学习。希望同志们和朋友们多多帮助我完成这个思想革命。我愿意把自己融化在社会主义大集体里，做一个小螺丝钉，为祖国伟大的社会主义和共产主义事业，尽一分力，发一分光，这将是我一生最大的光荣。最后我要高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
