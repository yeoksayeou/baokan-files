    New Approaches to Enterprise Business Management
    The development of productive forces always demands a corresponding change in the relations of production. Whether the relations of production can be changed accordingly, and how quickly they can be changed, affects whether and how quickly the productive forces can develop. Enterprise management is a component of the relations of production. Now, the great increase in production efficiency has brought a greater workload of daily business to enterprise management, requiring management work to greatly improve its efficiency and quality in order to adapt. Technological innovation and technological revolution have rapidly increased production and technical levels, which also requires enterprise management cadres and the broad masses of workers to carry out a series of new reforms. For example, production planning and scheduling, raw material supply, and other work must be improved; production equipment, product design, and production technology must be innovated; labor organization and wage quotas must also be rectified and improved. In particular, with the improvement of production technology and the changes in people's thinking, the entire enterprise's management organization, management system, and management methods must also be changed accordingly. All of this requires management personnel to go deeper into production, to discover, study, and solve problems in a timely manner. The broad masses of workers are engaged in large-scale innovation and creation, and enterprises must advance towards high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new technologies, which also requires technical and management personnel to have more time to carry out scientific research, go deep into reality, earnestly combine with workers, jointly engage in large-scale innovation and creation, and promptly summarize various new technologies and new experiences, and quickly organize promotion. Only by doing this can we promote the great development of the technical revolution movement and promote the great development of productive forces. Now, many comrades in enterprises are also working hard to do this. However, everyone also has a common distress, which is that they are troubled by being entangled in daily trivial matters and cannot get out of the office. It is difficult to complete the existing workload even with overtime, so how can they free up enough time and energy to study and solve new and major problems? According to the research and analysis of the comrades of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, enterprise management personnel are tied up by several kinds of tedious labor all day long and cannot be liberated: first, numerical calculations; second, data retrieval; third, copying, writing, tracing, and printing; fourth, transmission and communication; fifth, form reporting business procedures. These five aspects of tedious labor are the most time-consuming and labor-intensive in the department's work. They call it the "Five Tedious." To change the status quo, we must make a revolution in these "Five Tedious." The Party committees of the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant and the Shenyang Water Pump Factory launched the workers to march towards the "Five Tedious" in management business. Their approach is to vigorously innovate the tools and methods of daily operation in management work, create various electric and simple calculating machines and quick search machines, and turn many manual operations into mechanization. They also reformed the business forms and the methods and procedures of transmission and communication, resulting in greatly improved work efficiency. In this way, enterprise management personnel are liberated from tedious labor, which can not only make the existing work faster and better, but also free up time to go deep into production and into reality, to discover and solve new problems in a timely manner, and can adapt to the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, and start to improve the management of the entire enterprise. Therefore, this technical revolution in enterprise business management can be said to be the beginning of comprehensively improving enterprise management work, and it also creates conditions for further improving enterprise management work. By working hard along this path, we will certainly be able to make the entire enterprise management work keep up with and adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, and promote the Great Leap Forward.
    The technical revolutions in enterprise business management of these two factories were carried out after learning from the experience of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute. Some management personnel of the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, before visiting the Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute, believed that department work could not be revolutionized. After the visit, the Party committee of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant criticized the argument that "we cannot use the things of the Design Institute," and educated the workers to realize that: the specific methods cannot be used, but the revolutionary spirit of the comrades of the Design Institute can certainly be used. They mobilized the workers to use this spirit to earnestly study the revolution in their own factory, and finally found the specific direction and method of the technical revolution in business management. Then they held a meeting to swear an oath, held a competition, vigorously promoted and created, and in this way took advantage of the momentum to carry out the revolution. Facts show that the emergence of every new thing and new experience has two meanings: one is that it can be promoted in a certain specific scope of work; the other is that its generation and creation process reflects valuable ideas and spirit, which can give people great encouragement, education, and enlightenment, and this part has a broader meaning. Whether learning any new experience, it is better to learn and apply both of these aspects together; if the specific things are not applicable, then the broad experience should be learned and applied to educate and mobilize the masses. Only paying attention to learning specific experience and not paying attention to learning and applying its ideas and spirit, or giving up the latter because the former cannot be learned, it is difficult to obtain "true scriptures" and borrow "East Wind" to ride the waves.

### 企业业务管理的新途径

    企业业务管理的新途径
    生产力的发展，总是要求生产关系相应地变革。生产关系是否能够相应地变革和变革快慢，影响着生产力的能否发展和发展快慢。企业管理是生产关系的一个组成部分。现在，生产效率大提高，给企业管理带来更大的日常业务工作量，要求管理工作大大提高效率和质量才能适应；技术革新和技术革命使生产和技术水平飞快地提高，又要求企业管理干部和广大职工进行一系列的新的改革工作，比如生产计划调度、原料材料供应等工作要改进，生产设备、产品设计、生产工艺等要革新，劳动组织、工资定额等也要整顿、改进，特别是随着生产技术水平的提高和人们思想面貌的变化，整个企业的管理组织、管理制度、管理方法，也必须相应地变革。所有这些，都需要管理人员更多地深入生产，及时发现、研究和解决问题。广大职工大搞革新创造，企业要向高、大、精、尖、新进军，也都需要技职管理人员有更多的时间开展科学研究，并深入实际，认真地和工人结合，共同大搞革新创造，和及时总结各种新技术新经验，迅速组织推广。做到这样，才能促进技术革命运动大发展，促进生产力大发展。现在，许多企业的同志也正在努力这样做。但是，大家又都有一种共同性的苦恼，这就是苦于被日常繁琐的事务缠身，走不出办公室，现有的业务量加班加点还难完成，又怎么能腾出足够的时间和精力，去研究解决新的重大的问题呢？根据沈阳水泵厂的同志们研究分析，企业管理人员整天被几种繁琐的劳动捆住，不得解放：一是数字计算，二是资料查找，三是抄、写、描、印，四是传递、联系，五是表报业务手续。这五个方面的繁琐劳动，是科室工作中最费时间、占用人力最多的。他们称为“五繁”。要改变现状，就必须对这“五繁”大闹革命。沈阳机车车辆厂和沈阳水泵厂党委，就是发动职工向管理业务中的“五繁”进军。他们的做法是大力革新管理工作中日常运用的工具和工作方法，创造出各种各样电动的、简易的速算机具和速查机具，并把许多手工作业改成机械化，还改革了业务表报和传递、联系的方法、手续，结果使工作效率大大提高。这样，企业管理人员就从繁琐的劳动中解放出来，既能把现有的工作做得又快又好，又能腾出时间深入生产，深入实际，去及时地发现和解决新问题，能适应技术革新、技术革命的发展，着手改进整个企业的管理工作。因此，这种企业业务管理技术革命，可以说是全面提高企业管理工作的开始，也是给进一步改进企业管理工作创造了条件。沿着这条途径努力，就一定能够使整个企业管理工作跟上和适应大跃进的新形势，并促进大跃进。
    这两个厂的企业业务管理技术革命，都是在学习了沈阳铝镁设计研究院的经验后搞起来的，沈阳机车车辆厂的某些管理人员，在没参观铝镁设计研究院以前，认为科室工作不能革命。参观以后，机车车辆厂党委批判了“设计院的东西我们用不上”的论调，教育职工认识：具体做法用不上，设计院同志的革命精神却一定能用上。他们发动职工用这种精神认真研究在本厂闹革命，终于找到了业务管理技术革命的具体方向和做法，接着就开会誓师，比武，大推广，大创造，这样趁热打铁，乘风破浪，就把革命闹起来了。事实说明，每一项新事物、新经验的出现，都具有两种意义：一是它本身可以在一定的具体工作范围推广；二是它的产生和创造过程，反映了可贵的思想和精神，能给人以重大的鼓舞、教育和启示，这一部分具有更广泛的意义。不论学习任何新经验，对这两方面能一起学到和运用，更好；如果具体的东西不适用，则应学习和运用其广义的经验，去教育、发动群众。只注意学具体的经验，不注意学习和运用其思想和精神，或者因学不到前者，而把后者也放弃，这是很难取到“真经”和借到“东风”乘风破浪的。　　　（摘自辽宁日报）
