According to United Press International, the plan is to increase "the number of 'Atlas' intercontinental missiles placed on launch pads and available for use" before 1962. The U.S. Department of Defense is considering a plan to add eighteen "Atlas" missiles and two launch pads.

The Army also requested Congress to approve $55.5 million in funding to develop chemical and biological weapons, $13 million more than the current amount.

The U.S. Navy Department announced on the 28th that it would use $52.2 million to accelerate the construction of submarines launching "Polaris" missiles. The Navy Department said it would work overtime to build the seven "Polaris" missile submarines currently under construction and would order materials and equipment to begin building more submarines approved by Congress.

Handing Over Military Airports to Thailand for Management; Installing Missile Weapons in Italy

Prior to this, the United States had handed over the "U.S. Aid" military airport in Chiang Mai Province to the Thai authorities on the 11th.

U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Johnson, admitted when presiding over the airport handover ceremony on the 21st that the above four airports have significant military value.

According to an earlier report by United Press International, a "Jupiter" missile base has already been established in Italy.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of the Army announced that the advance team of the U.S. Army Arctic Research Organization has arrived at Camp Tuto on the Greenland ice cap to begin implementing the Army's Arctic Research and Development Center plan.
