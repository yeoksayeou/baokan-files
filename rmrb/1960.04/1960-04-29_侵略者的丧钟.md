    Death Knell for the Invaders
    Xie Fan
    Comrade Mao Zedong, at the Supreme State Conference on September 8, 1958, made the following analysis of the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism: "...All U.S. military bases abroad are nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism. It is not others, but the Americans themselves who make these nooses and put them around their own necks, handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people... and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people of the world. The longer the American aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their heads will become." Now this great truth has been confirmed once again in South Korea, which is ablaze with flames of resistance. U.S. imperialism has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in South Korea, and the spies and police of the Lee Seung-man puppet clique it has supported are also densely distributed throughout the land of South Korea. The twelve years of fascist dictatorial rule cannot be said to be short. The U.S.-Lee reactionary clique was convinced that their bloody claws could blot out the sky and forever keep the South Korean people under their feet. However, facts have proved that their calculations were wrong again. No matter how ferocious the U.S. imperialism played the role of "world gendarme" in South Korea, no matter how cruel and bloody the means of suppression used by the Lee Seung-man reactionary clique, the South Korean people finally stood up heroically in the pool of blood, destroyed and burned the reactionary organs of the U.S.-Lee clique, the reactionary leader Lee Seung-man was ousted from power, and the small dynasty of agents "carefully managed" by the American aggressors for twelve years collapsed. This is another resounding slap in the face of the American aggressors in front of the people of the world, and another exposure to the people of the world of the blood debts owed by this "world gendarme." The noose is getting tighter and tighter!
    It seems that the American colonial rulers are still not willing to take off the noose around their necks automatically. The U.S. State Department is convening the accomplices who participated in the Korean War to meet and conspire to further suppress the just struggle of the South Korean people; at the same time, it is playing new tricks, supporting new puppet regimes, deceiving the people, and numbing the people's fighting spirit, so as to continue to maintain its colonial rule. However, no matter what tricks the American aggressors use, the South Korean people, who have grown stronger in the anti-resistance struggle, will never tolerate the colonial rule of the American aggressors again. They will drive the American aggressors into the sea like they drove away Lee Seung-man. If the American aggressors dare to play with fire, the Korean people and the people of the world cannot forgive this evil dog who has committed bloody crimes in Korea, tighten the noose around its neck, and sentence it to hang.

    侵略者的丧钟
    谢帆
    毛泽东同志在1958年9月8日最高国务会议上，对于美帝国主义的殖民统治，曾经做过这样的分析：“……所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民……和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”现在这个伟大的真理，在燃烧着反抗火焰的南朝鲜，又一次得到了证实。美帝国主义者在南朝鲜驻扎过几十万大军，它所扶植的李承晚傀儡集团的特务、警察也密布在南朝鲜的土地上，十二年来法西斯独裁的恐怖统治，也不能说算短。美李反动集团满以为他们的血腥魔爪，可以遮天蔽日，永远把南朝鲜的人民踩在脚下。但是，事实证明他们的算盘又打错了，不管美帝国主义这个“世界宪兵”的角色在南朝鲜扮演得多么凶恶，不管李承晚反动集团用了多么残酷的血腥镇压的手段，南朝鲜人民终于在血泊里英勇地站起来了，捣毁、焚烧了美李集团的反动政权机关，反动头子李承晚被赶下台了，美国侵略者在十二年中“苦心经营”的代理人的小朝廷土崩瓦解了。这是在全世界人民面前，又一次打了美国侵略者的一个最响亮的耳光，又一次向全世界人民揭露了这个“世界宪兵”所欠下的血债。绞索越拉越紧了！
    看来，美国殖民统治者还是不甘心自动地摘下脖子上的绞索，美国国务院正在召集参加侵略朝鲜战争的帮凶们在开会，阴谋进一步镇压南朝鲜人民的正义斗争；和这同时，又在玩弄新的手法，扶植新的傀儡政权，欺骗人民，麻痹人民的斗志，以便继续维持它的殖民统治。但是，不管美国侵略者使用什么样的鬼伎俩，在反抗斗争中壮大起来的南朝鲜人民，绝不会再容忍美国侵略者的殖民统治，他们将会像赶走李承晚一样，把美国侵略者赶下海去，如果美国侵略者胆敢玩火，朝鲜人民和全世界人民都不能饶恕这只在朝鲜犯下了血腥罪行的恶狗，拉紧套在它脖子上的绞索，处以绞刑。
