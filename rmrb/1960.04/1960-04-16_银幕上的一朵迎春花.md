A Forsythia on the Screen

Having watched the opera art film "Mu Guiying Takes Command," performed by the Dongfeng Troupe of the Handan Special District, Hebei Province, I was deeply impressed by the wonderful performances of the young actors.

It was not an easy task for actress Hu Xiaofeng, who is only thirteen years old, to play the fifty-three-year-old Mu Guiying. However, thanks to the care and cultivation of the Party, the enthusiastic teaching of veteran artists, and her own diligent study and practice, she has achieved great artistic success in portraying the character's thoughts, feelings, and personality. In particular, her performance in the scene where Wen Guang and Jin Hua return with the marshal's seal was very successful. She vividly portrayed Mu Guiying's conflicting emotions and complex thoughts, expressing both her joy for her children's bravery and her anger at the trouble caused by splitting Wang Lun. At the same time, Hu Xiaofeng's singing was clear and melodious, her dancing was graceful, and her movements were agile, thus her performance deeply attracted the audience.

Other young actors, such as those playing She Taijun, Yang Wenguang, and Yang Jinhua, also showed the different characteristics of their respective characters.

This wonderful opera art film fully demonstrates that under the leadership of the Party and in the superior socialist system, a new generation of opera artists is growing vigorously. This is a lovable forsythia on the screen.

    银幕上的一朵迎春花
    看了戏曲艺术片——由河北邯郸专区东风剧团演出的“穆桂英挂帅”，那些小演员的精彩表演，给我留下了深刻的印象。
    演员胡小凤同志仅有十三岁，要饰五十三岁的穆桂英，确是一个不太容易的事。但是由于党的关怀培养，老艺人热心传授和她自己的勤学苦练，对人物的思想感情和性格的刻划上，都取得了很大的艺术成就。尤其是当文广、金花取得帅印回来那一场，她表演得非常成功。她把穆桂英一面为儿女们的英勇惊喜，一面又为刀劈王伦闯下祸事生气的种种矛盾心理和复杂的思想情感，很好地表现出来了。同时，胡小凤的唱腔清晰、动听，舞姿优美，动作灵活，因此她的表演深深吸引住观众。
    其他像饰演佘太君、杨文广、杨金花的小演员，也都表现了不同人物的风貌。
    这部精彩的戏曲艺术片，充分显示了在党的领导下，优越的社会主义制度下，新的一代戏曲艺人正在蓬勃成长，这是银幕上的一朵受人喜爱的迎春花。
