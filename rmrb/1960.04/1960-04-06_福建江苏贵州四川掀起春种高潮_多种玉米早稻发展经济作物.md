Fujian, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Sichuan Launch Spring Planting High Tide
Diversified Corn, Early Rice, and Development of Cash Crops

Fujian Seizes Opportunity After Rain to Rush Planting

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Since mid-March, Fujian has experienced continuous spring rains, with rainfall generally exceeding 100 millimeters, ending the prolonged drought. All regions are seizing the opportunity after the rain to rush plant various crops. To date, the province has completed over 97% of its early rice seed soaking plan, and has transplanted and directly sown early rice on more than 1.88 million mu, with the transplanting progress being 5.6 times faster than the same period last year. The sown area of crops such as sugarcane, jute, and peanuts, which are also being rushed planted in various regions, is also 17% to more than double that of the same period last year. The newly developed "Wanbao Mountains" this spring have also been planted with more than 4 million mu of forests, fruits, cash crops, and coarse grains.

Having achieved a major victory in the fight against drought and gained spring rain, the people of Fujian have even greater confidence and enthusiasm in seizing a bumper summer harvest and realizing the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. A great situation of taking grain as the key, comprehensively leaping forward, and planting more, planting faster, and planting better is appearing everywhere. Longxi Prefecture, which had the earliest season and the most severe drought originally, made every effort to expand the spring planting area during the pre- and post-rain rush planting. The early rice planting area in the region will be expanded from more than 1.4 million mu to 1.8 million mu, and the area of coarse grains will be expanded by using the newly developed large-scale "Wanbao Mountains". Currently, 1 million mu of early rice has been transplanted and directly sown, and peanuts, soybeans, and sugarcane have completed more than 56%, 87%, and 93% of their planting plans, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: The tool reform movement in rural Fujian Province has developed from single-item reform to complete set reform, and from sample selection and finalization to comprehensive promotion. To date, various new agricultural tools and machinery that have been manufactured and promoted in various regions throughout the province total more than 2.8 million pieces (sets), exceeding the original promotion plan by 9%, with an average of more than 5,000 new agricultural tools and machinery added to each commune. During the tool reform movement, mass agricultural tool appraisal conferences were also held in various regions. Through appraisal, the best were selected and quickly finalized, matched, promoted, and used.

Fujian Province's tool reform movement is closely integrated with spring production. Since the beginning of spring, various regions, based on the characteristics of this year's spring harvest and spring planting areas being larger than in previous years and production tasks being heavier than last year, have concentrated their efforts on manufacturing and promoting more than 1 million pieces of various agricultural tools and machinery for spring plowing and spring harvesting. In the next two months or so, they will continue to manufacture and promote more than 1 million sets of rice transplanters and fast harvesters.

Jiangsu Plants One-Third of Rice Seedlings

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Early rice sowing and seedling raising work in Jiangsu Province generally started 10 to 15 days earlier than last year. Now, both north and south of the Yangtze River are filled with a busy scene of accumulating and delivering fertilizer, meticulously preparing seedling fields, and germinating and sowing seeds. To date, early rice seedling fields where seeds have been sown account for 33% of the plan for the whole province. Suzhou Prefecture, which is progressing rapidly, has already completed its sowing plan.

This year, various regions have carried out major technological innovations in early rice sowing and seedling raising. Many areas such as Jiangning, Kunshan, and Binhai have created "earth fire dragon" warm room germination, which can germinate all seeds in two or three days, which is faster and more uniform than the general beach germination method; the Lixiahe area has found the root cause of seedling rot caused by old paddy fields for many years and is carrying out seedling field relocation on a large scale. In order to prevent cold waves, various regions have also prepared cold-proof equipment such as windbreaks and straw curtains for seedling fields based on the successful experience of small-area experimental fields. Most double-cropping rice early seedling fields in the Taihu Lake area have added straw curtains and windbreaks.

At present, various regions are conducting general inspections on a commune basis, checking preparations, checking progress, checking management, and checking whether a responsibility system with several fixed points to the fields has been established, and supplementing whatever is lacking while inspecting and supplementing.

Guizhou Plants Large Amounts of Flue-Cured Tobacco and Sugar Crops

This newspaper reports: Guizhou Province vigorously implements the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way." While grasping the spring sowing of food crops, it also promotes the spring sowing and seedling raising of economic crops in parallel, developing in all directions. Guizhou flue-cured tobacco, which is famous in China, has overfulfilled the seedling raising task, with an area of more than 130,000 mu. Guizhou is one of the main tussah silkworm producing areas in China, and more than 1.4 million mu of tussah forests have been reclaimed. This year, Guizhou's first large-scale planting of sugar crops—sugar beets—has nearly completed the sowing task; in the hot Panjiang River Basin and Chishui River area, the sugarcane planting plan has been completed by 91%. Planting plans for ramie, cotton, tea, fruit trees, vegetables, medicinal materials, etc., have all been completed better than in the same period last year.

This year, the spring sowing of economic crops in the whole province was early and good, with timely management. The tobacco producing areas started flue-cured tobacco sowing and seedling raising work as early as last winter, with the sowing period generally 20 days to a month earlier than last year. At present, most tobacco seedlings have emerged, and the province has organized more than 8,000 professional teams to carry out field management. Majiang County-Dushan County in Guizhou used the short-root propagation method to complete ramie transplanting work three months earlier than last year. The silkworm producing areas carried out tussah silkworm hatching work in batches under the principle of adapting to local conditions. In order to ensure timely early sowing of cotton, Tongren Prefecture has made 120 million cotton nutrient pots and 240 mu of square grid seedling raising. This year, the province adopted the method of shortening root propagation of sugarcane on an area of more than 92,000 mu, accounting for more than 50% of the planting plan; this will have a major impact on saving seeds, early growth, early harvesting, and early sugar extraction.

Sichuan's Large-Scale Directional Dense Planting of Corn

This newspaper, Chengdu, 5th: Sichuan is planting large amounts of corn as an important measure to implement the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's "early planting, diversified planting, high yield".

This year, the characteristics of corn production in Sichuan Province are that early, mid, and late-season corn are generally planted on a large scale, fundamentally changing the situation in the past where most areas only planted one season or a small amount of corn, and creating a new leap forward situation in corn production. At present, more than 10 million mu of early corn has been sown throughout the province, and more than 80% of it has been directionally densely planted, greatly breaking through the original plan of planting 8 million mu. The sowing time in various regions is one to two solar terms earlier than last year; plant it and manage it immediately, and the seedlings emerge neatly and are robust.

The whole province, whether it is high mountains, hills, or plains, has broken with habits and planted corn on a large scale. Areas with more planting in the past have further expanded the area; areas with less planting in the past have tried every means to increase the sown area; marginal areas with more land have widely planted corn on barren slopes and mountains; areas with more people and less land have made great efforts to increase planting, intercropping, and interplanting.

This year, various regions have widely adopted and further developed the experience of planting "kings" over the years, and have generally planted large amounts of corn "kings", promoting corn production to a new stage of development. The Yibin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that 1 million mu of early corn in the entire prefecture be cultivated into "kings", of which 40% must achieve a yield of half a catty to one catty per plant, 30% must achieve a yield of one catty to three catties per plant, 25% must achieve a yield of three catties to five catties per plant, and 5% must achieve a yield of more than five catties per plant. According to this requirement, the people's communes in the entire prefecture fully mobilized the commune members and initially focused on early key measures to increase production such as early sowing, deep plowing, heavy application of base fertilizer, and careful selection of improved varieties to ensure that every plant becomes a "king".

    福建江苏贵州四川掀起春种高潮
    多种玉米早稻发展经济作物
    福建抓雨后时机抢种
    据新华社福州讯　3月中旬以来，福建各地连降春雨，雨量一般都有一百毫米以上，久旱解除。全省各地抓紧雨后时机抢种各种农作物。到目前止，全省早稻浸种计划已经完成97％以上，并已插秧和直播早稻一百八十八万多亩，插秧进度比去年同期快五点六倍多。各地抢种的甘蔗、黄麻、花生等作物，播种面积也比去年同期多17％到一倍以上。今春各地新开发的“万宝山”，也已种上林、果、经济作物和杂粮等四百多万亩。
    取得抗旱斗争的重大胜利又获春雨的福建人民，对夺取夏季大丰收和实现今年农业生产的继续跃进，信心更足，干劲更大，到处出现以粮为纲、全面跃进和种得多、种得快、种得好的大好局面。季节最早、原先旱情最重的龙溪专区，在雨前雨后的抢耕抢种中千方百计扩大春种面积。全区早稻种植面积将由一百四十多万亩扩大到一百八十万亩，并利用新开大面积“万宝山”，扩大杂粮面积。现已插秧和直播早稻一百万亩，花生、大豆和甘蔗等已分别完成种植计划56％、87％和93％以上。
    新华社福州讯　福建省农村的工具改革运动，已由单项改革发展到成套改革，由选样定型发展到全面推广。到目前为止，全省各地已经制造和推广的各种新式农具、机械有二百八十多万件（部），超额
  9％完成了原订的推广计划，平均每个公社都新增加了五千多部新农具和新机械。在工具改革运动中，各地还召开了群众性的农具评比大会，通过评比，优中选优，迅速定型配套，推广使用。
    福建省的工具改革运动，是紧密结合春季生产进行的。入春以来，各地根据今年春收、春种面积比往年大，生产任务比去年重等特点，集中力量制造、推广了春耕、春收等各种农具机械一百多万件，在今后的二个多月内，还将继续制造和推广一百多万部插秧机和快速收割器。
    江苏三分之一秧田下种
    新华社南京讯　江苏省早稻播种育秧工作普遍比去年提早十到十五天开始。现在，大江南北到处都是一片积肥送肥、精做秧田、催芽落谷的繁忙景象。到目前止，全省落谷的早稻秧田已占计划33％。进度快的苏州专区已经完成了播种计划。
    今年各地在早稻播种育秧中大搞技术革新。江宁、昆山、滨海等不少地区创造“地火龙”暖房催芽，两三天时间就可以全部出芽，比一般上滩催芽法又快又齐；里下河地区找到历年老沤田下秧造成烂秧的病根子，大搞秧田搬家。为了防止寒潮袭击，各地还根据小面积试验田的成功经验，普遍为秧田准备了风障、草帘等防寒设备。太湖地区大部分双季稻早秧田都增设草帘和风障。
    目前各地正以公社为单位，普遍进行大检查，查准备、查进度、查管理、查有没有建立几定到田的责任制度，缺啥补啥，边查边补。
    贵州大种烤烟糖料作物
    本报讯　贵州省大力贯彻执行“以粮为纲、全面发展”的方针，在抓好粮食作物春播的同时，也使经济作物的春播育苗工作齐头并进，展翅双飞。闻名国内的贵州烤烟，已超额完成育苗任务，面积达十三万多亩。贵州是我国主要柞蚕产区之一，目前已垦复柞林一百四十多万亩。今年贵州第一次大量种植的糖料作物——甜菜，已接近完成播种任务；在气候炎热的盘江流域和赤水河一带，甘蔗播种计划已完成91％。苎麻、棉花、茶叶、果树、蔬菜、药材等种植计划都比去年同期完成得好。
    今年全省经济作物春播又早又好，管理及时。各产烟区早在去冬就开始进行烤烟播种育苗工作，播种期一般比去年提早二十天到一个月。目前，大部分烟苗已出土，全省组织八千多个专业队进行田间管理。贵州的麻县—独山县用短根繁殖法，使苎麻移栽工作比去年提前三个月完成。各蚕区在因地制宜的原则下，分批进行了柞蚕烘种工作。铜仁专区为保证棉花适时早播，已制棉花营养钵一亿两万个、方格育苗二百四十亩。全省今年采用缩根繁殖甘蔗的面积达九万二千多亩，占种植计划的50％以上；这对于省种、早长、早收、早榨糖将有重大作用。
    四川玉米大面积定向密植
    本报成都5日电　四川各地大种玉米，作为贯彻省委“早种、多种、高产”精神的重要措施之一。
    今年，四川省玉米生产的特点，是普遍大种早、中、晚三季玉米，从根本上改变了过去大部分地区只种一季或种少量玉米的情况，使玉米生产出现了新的跃进形势。目前，全省已播种早玉米一千多万亩，80％以上实行定向密植，大大突破了原订种植八百万亩的计划。各地播种时间都比去年提前一个到两个节令；种下就管，出苗整齐、茁壮。
    全省无论高山、丘陵、平原，都打破习惯大种玉米。原来种植较多的地区，进一步扩大了面积；原来种植较少的地区，千方百计增加了播种面积；土地较多的边沿地区，利用荒坡、荒山广种玉米；人多地少的地区，见缝插针大搞增种、套种、间种等。
    今年各地都广泛采用和进一步发挥了历年来种“王”的经验，普遍大种玉米“王”，把玉米生产推进到一个新的发展阶段。中共宜宾地委要求全专区一百万亩早玉米，全部培育成“王”，其中，40％要达到株产半斤至一斤，30％达到株产一斤至三斤，25％达到株产三斤至五斤，5％株产五斤以上。根据这个要求，全专区各人民公社充分发动社员，一开始就狠抓早播、深耕、重施底肥、精选良种等早期增产关键，确保株株成“王”。
