Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget draft, and I am determined to implement them in my work.

In 1959, on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our country achieved an all-around continued Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses on all fronts of national economic construction conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, overfulfilling the annual construction plan and completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy three years ahead of schedule. This is not only unprecedented in our country but also in the world.

The situation on the cultural and educational front is also very good. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor, and education work must be led by the Party," and the method of "walking on two legs" to develop education, China's education has undergone tremendous changes and development.

Under the leadership of the Party, Jilin University of Technology has undergone fundamental changes.

Our Jilin University of Technology, like other brother schools, under the leadership of the Party and through the educational revolution, has undergone fundamental changes. Especially inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the work of the school is continuing in a Great Leap Forward.

Due to the implementation of the Party Central Committee's educational policy and the instruction of "one major, two subsidiary, and three combinations," our school's scientific research and technological revolution in cooperation with production enterprises and scientific research institutions are advancing along a healthy path. In the past year, a total of more than 5,700 faculty and students have gone to more than 150 units in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country, cooperating with factories and mining enterprises, transportation, and people's communes related to automobiles, transportation, tractors, agricultural machinery, machinery manufacturing, and metallurgy, undertaking more than 600 scientific research and technological innovation tasks.

In the field of automobiles, the gasoline injection equipment jointly researched by our school and Nanjing Automobile Factory has been trial-produced and completed. Tests have shown that both power and economy have been improved. The first automotive automatic clutch in China has also been designed and manufactured by our school recently and is working satisfactorily.

Faculty and students majoring in automobile application engineering have traveled to various parts of the country to cooperate with factories and enterprises, designing twelve automobile repair shops and mechanized loading and unloading equipment, and conducting in-depth research and experiments on the reasonable load of automobile trains, improving the transportation capacity of automobiles and solving some practical and theoretical problems for the realization of automobile trains. At the National Science and Technology Work Conference of the Ministry of Communications, our school gave an introduction to the reasonable load of automobile trains, which was well received and adopted in many places.

Faculty and students majoring in tractors creatively designed several types of indigenous tractors, which have been trial-produced in our school and Fuyu Lishu counties and have been basically finalized. They are ready to be put into production and become a tractor that can be used for both cultivation and transportation, and as a power source for agricultural product processing, which has great value for the development of agriculture in our country.

Faculty and students majoring in agricultural machinery, in cooperation with fraternal units, have designed and improved more than ten kinds of deep plowing farm tools. Among them, the suspended double-share deep plowing plow has been decided to be put into production in Jilin Province after many tests. A complete set of ridge tillage machinery suitable for the Jilin area has been designed and trial-produced, and preliminary results have been obtained in field experiments. Currently, research is being conducted on twenty-seven topics such as soybean harvesters and corn harvesters, which has far-reaching significance for agricultural mechanization. Our school's research on internal combustion water pumps is original. On the basis of successful trial production of China's first internal combustion water pump in cooperation with the Agricultural Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Machine Building in 1958, we are actively carrying out the finalization and theoretical research of the in-line double-cylinder internal combustion water pump, which has played a great role in promoting internal combustion water pumps throughout the country.

Participation in scientific research and technological revolution has enriched teaching content and improved teaching quality.

In the movement to participate in technological revolution, our school has also achieved great results. In the recent two months or so, while carrying out technological revolution in school factories, farms, and various administrative departments, we have also transferred a group of teachers and students to participate in technological innovation outside the school. As of the end of February, a total of more than 800 teachers and students have assisted factories and mining enterprises in eight provinces and more than twenty cities and counties across the country in carrying out technological revolution. Among them, more than 300 people in Changchun City participated in more than 60 units, not only distributed in various types of factories but also distributed in basic construction, transportation departments, financial and trade systems, and service industries. This has greatly promoted the development of technological revolution in various industries. According to incomplete statistics, as of the beginning of March, a total of 350 projects have been carried out, of which 172 have been completed, including 36 automatic production lines, 30 single-machine automation, 37 mechanization of manual operations, 69 machine tool modifications, tool improvements, and advanced technologies. Among them, there are more than 20 relatively cutting-edge and major ones: for example, the plate machine designed and manufactured by our school for Siping Agricultural Machinery Factory, which increased efficiency by 40 times, and the straightening machine, which increased efficiency by 23 times; the automatic line for processing silicon steel sheets designed and manufactured with the assistance of Changchun Transformer Factory, which increased productivity by four times; the automatic metering coal feeder created with the assistance of the Coal Construction Company Warehouse of the First Commercial Bureau of Changchun City, which not only ensured accurate measurement but also reduced the weighing time of a vehicle from 30 minutes to 2 minutes, greatly improving the utilization rate of automobiles. For example, the automatic piston processing line designed in cooperation with the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, after assembly, two workers can complete the work of more than ten workers in the past, and by using the newly designed and manufactured circular broach and adjusting the broaching machine, the production rate of straight-tooth bevel gears can be increased by eight times.

Our school's scientific research and participation in the technological revolution movement have made theory more closely linked to practice, enriched teaching content, and improved teaching quality. According to statistics in February, teachers across the school wrote a total of 390 summaries, reports, and papers, and compiled 46 kinds of textbooks and lecture notes in combination with scientific research and production experience. Undoubtedly, this plays a great role in improving the quality of teaching. What is even more noteworthy is that in the actual process of participating in the technological revolution, inspired by the soaring enthusiasm and excellent qualities of workers and peasants, teachers and students have received good education and training, cultivated the feelings of workers and peasants, strengthened the labor viewpoint, class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and dialectical materialism viewpoint, and greatly improved their ideological level.

Three experiences of the school, scientific research institutions, and factories combined

In the past few years, especially since 1958, in carrying out scientific research work and technological revolution in cooperation with production enterprises and scientific research institutions, we have the following experiences and understandings.

1.  Strengthen the leadership of the Party and carry out mass movements on a large scale. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for scientific research to achieve great results. Past facts have proved that in the collaboration between factories and schools to carry out scientific research on a large scale, there are struggles between two roads, two ideologies, and two methods. This struggle is mainly manifested in the mass line and the expert line. Under the leadership of the Party, we adhere to putting politics in command, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, carrying out the struggle between two roads in the field of science and technology, breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and thus vigorously carrying out mass scientific research and achieving remarkable results. The scientific research projects we completed in a short period of a few months are equivalent to twice the total number of projects from 1955 to 1957, showing the power of mass movements in scientific research. By strengthening the leadership of the Party and mobilizing the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, our work has vigorously embarked on the road of more, faster, better, and more economical.

2.  According to the instruction of "one major, two subsidiary, and three combinations," comprehensively arrange teaching, production, and scientific research. The purpose of implementing this policy is to improve the quality of teaching and at the same time promote the development of production and science and technology. In regular and specific work, we should, of course, consider comprehensively, arrange properly, and correctly combine the completion of tasks and the realization of teaching requirements. In the special situation of the movement, we should grasp the principles, plan carefully, and resolutely implement them to make teaching, production, and scientific research more closely integrated, complement each other, and leap forward together, and the effect will be greater.

3.  Three combinations outside the school, promote the spirit of communist cooperation. Promoting the spirit of communist great cooperation and realizing the cooperation of production enterprises, scientific research institutions, and schools is one of the important methods to complete national production and scientific research tasks and cultivate talents who are both red and expert. In order to do a good job in cooperation and complete the task well, we should promote the communist style, that is, do our best for common tasks, take the completion of work as a prerequisite, take care of each other, and support each other. In the work, we must also learn from each other, improve each other, and solve problems through consultation together, in order to achieve "everyone improves, and the relationship is harmonious." This will make the work better and faster.

Although our school has done some work in the movement of scientific and technological revolution, this is only a beginning. We are determined to better study Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves, resolutely implement the Party's education policy, and continue to deepen the technological revolution movement. Under the leadership of the Party, we will continue to mobilize all teachers, students, and staff to participate in the movement, to achieve full school mobilization, internal and external combination, overall planning, highlighting key points, attacking science and technology with more, faster, better, and more economical results, contributing our strength, and striving for the modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture in our country.

专栏：

    为国家培养更多的红专人材
    黄叔培委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告及李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并决心在工作中贯彻执行。
    我国1959年，在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了全面的继续大跃进。全国经济建设各条战线上的广大群众，在党的领导下，认真地贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会的精神，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，超额地完成了全年的建设计划，并且提前三年完成了发展国民经济第二个五年计划的主要指标。这不仅在我国是史无前例，即在世界上也是史无前例的。
    文教战线上的形势也好得很。自党中央提出“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，教育工作必须由党来领导”，和用“两条腿走路”的办法来发展教育事业的方针以后，我国的教育事业有了巨大的变化和发展。
    在党的领导下，吉林工业大学的面貌起了根本变化
    我们吉林工业大学和其他兄弟学校一样，在党的领导之下，经过教育革命，学校的面貌发生了根本的变化。特别在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，学校的各项工作都在继续大跃进。
    由于执行了党中央的教育方针和“一主二从三结合”的指示，我校与生产企业，科研机关协作的科学研究和技术革命都沿着健康的道路前进。一年以来共组织了五千七百余名师生人次分赴全国二十多个省市与汽车、汽运、拖拉机、农机、机械制造和矿冶等专业有关的厂矿企业，交通运输及人民公社等一百五十多个单位协作，共承担了六百多项科学研究和技术革新任务。
    在汽车方面，我校和南京汽车制造厂协作研究的汽油喷射设备，已试制完成，经试验在动力性上和经济性上都有所提高。我国第一具汽车用自动离合器，也在近日内由我校设计制成，工作满意。
    汽车运用工程的专业师生，奔赴全国各地和工厂企业合作，共设计了十二个汽车保修厂和机械化装卸设备，并对汽车列车化的合理载荷，进行深入的研究试验，提高了汽车的运输能力，为实现汽车列车化解决了一些实际和理论问题。在交通部全国科学技术工作会议上，我校作了汽车列车合理载重的介绍，得到好的评价和多处采用。
    拖拉机专业师生，创造性地设计了几种土拖拉机，先后在我校和扶余梨树等县试制，已基本定型，准备投入生产，成为一种既能耕种运输又能作为农产品加工动力的拖拉机，对于我国农业的发展具有很大的价值。
    农机专业的师生和兄弟单位协作，进行了十多种深耕农具的设计和改进，其中吊挂式二铧深耕犁，经多次试验后，已决定在吉林省投入生产。又设计试制了适合吉林地区的全套垅作机械，经田间试验得到了初步成绩。目前正又进行大豆收获机、玉米收获机等二十七个课题的研究，对农业机械化有极深远的意义。我校内燃水泵的研究是有独创性的。在1958年与一机部农业机械局协作试制成功我国第一台内燃水泵的基础上，又积极进行线列双缸式内燃水泵的定型和理论研究，对于内燃水泵推广全国起了很大的作用。
    参加科学研究和技术革命，丰富了教学内容提高了教学质量
    在参加技术革命的运动中，我校也取得了很大的成绩。最近两个多月以来，我们在校内工厂、农场，和各行政部门大搞技术革命的同时，又抽调了一批师生参加校外的技术革新。迄至2月底共有八百余名师生在全国八个省二十多个市县，协助厂矿企业进行技术革命。其中在长春市的有三百余人，参加的单位有六十余个，不仅分布在各型工厂而且分布在基建，交通运输部门，财贸系统和服务性行业。这就大大地推进了各个行业的技术革命的开展。据不完全的统计，到3月上旬共计进行了三百五十项，内中已完成的有一百七十二项，包括自动生产线三十六项；单机自动化三十项；手工操作机械化三十七项；机床改装，工具改进和先进工艺等六十九项。其中较为尖端重大的有二十多项：例如我校为四平农机厂设计制成的平板机，提高效率四十倍，调直机提高效率二十三倍；协助长春变压器厂设计制成的矽钢片加工自动线，提高生产率四倍；协助长春市第一商业局煤建公司仓库创造了自动计量付煤器，它不仅保证了度量正确而且使一辆车子的称量时间由三十分钟减至二分钟，大大地提高了汽车的利用率。又如我校和第一汽车制造厂协作设计的活塞加工自动线，装配完成后，两个工人就能完成过去十多个工人的工作，而利用新设计制造的圆拉刀并将拉齿机调整后，能将直齿锥形齿轮的生产率提高八倍。
    我校进行科学研究和参加技术革命运动，使理论更加密切联系实际，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。根据2月份的统计，全校教师共写了三百九十篇总结、报告和论文，并且结合科学研究和生产经验，编写了四十六种教材和讲义。无疑地，这对教学质量的提高，起着很大的作用。更加值得注意的，就是在参加技术革命的实际过程中，在工人农民们冲天干劲和优秀品质的鼓舞下，师生们都得到了很好的教育和锻炼，培养了工农感情，加强了劳动观点，阶级观点，群众观点，和辩证唯物主义观点，大大地提高了思想水平。
    学校同科学研究机关、工厂三结合的三点经验
    几年来，特别是1958年以来，在与生产企业，科研机关协作大搞科学研究工作和技术革命中，我们有以下的一些经验和体会。
    一、加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。党的领导是科学研究取得巨大成绩的根本保证。过去的事实证明，在厂矿学校协作大搞科学研究中，充满着两条道路，两种思想，两种方法的斗争。这种斗争又主要表现在群众路线与专家路线上。我们在党的领导下坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，开展科学技术领域内两条道路的斗争，破除迷信、解放思想，从而蓬勃地开展了群众性的科学研究，取得了显著的成绩。短短的几个月内我们完成的科研项目，相当于1955年至1957年项目总和的一倍，显示出群众运动搞科学研究的威力。由于加强党的领导，动员群众的干劲和智慧，我们的工作就轰轰烈烈地走上多快好省的道路。
    二、根据“一主二从三结合”的指示，全面安排教学、生产和科研。贯彻这个方针的目的是为了提高教学质量，同时促进生产和科学技术的发展。在经常具体工作中，固然应该全面考虑，妥善安排，把完成任务和实现教学要求，正确地结合起来，而在特殊的运动形势下，更当抓紧原则，仔细规划，坚决执行，使教学、生产、科研更密切地结合，相辅相成，共同跃进，效果也就更大。
    三、校外三结合，发扬共产主义协作精神。发扬共产主义大协作精神，实现生产企业，科研机关和学校三方面的协作，是完成国家生产、科研任务和培养又红又专人材的重要方法之一，为了搞好协作关系，很好地完成任务，应当发扬共产主义风格，即对共同任务尽力以赴，以完成工作为前提，互相照顾，互相支援。在工作中，还要互相学习，互相提高，对问题共同协商解决，以达到“人人提高，关系融洽”。这样就能使工作更好更快地完成。
    我校在大搞科学技术革命运动中，虽然作了一些工作，但这仅是一个开端。我们决心要更好地学习毛泽东思想来武装自己，坚决地贯彻党的教育方针，继续深入开展技术革命运动。在党的领导下，我们要继续发动全体师生员工投入运动中来，作到全校动员，内外结合，全面规划，重点突出，多快好省地向科学技术进攻，贡献出力量，为我国工业农业和科学文化的现代化而奋斗。
