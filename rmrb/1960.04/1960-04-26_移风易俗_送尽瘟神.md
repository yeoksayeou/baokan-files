A Note from the Party Secretary

    Changing Customs and Habits, Sending Away All the Gods of Plague
    Sun Yongjiu, Secretary of the CPC Yujiang County Committee, Jiangxi

    Inspired by the glorious poems of our beloved leader Chairman Mao – "Farewell to the God of Plague, Two Poems" – and building on the great victory of eradicating schistosomiasis, the heroic people of Yujiang are setting sail, braving the waves, and adopting methods of large-scale digging and shoveling, large-scale construction and transformation, and large-scale relocation and concentration to comprehensively and deeply carry out the unprecedented patriotic health campaign. With soaring ambitions and sky-high enthusiasm, they aim to eradicate the four pests and eliminate the six diseases.

    From their practice of fighting various diseases over the past few years, the vast number of cadres and masses deeply feel that to thoroughly achieve the great tasks of eliminating pests and diseases, invigorating everyone, changing customs and habits, and transforming the world, we must engage in large-scale efforts rather than small-scale ones, and focus on addressing the root causes rather than just the symptoms. The county Party committee summarized the experience of eradicating schistosomiasis and issued a heroic slogan: "Mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to wipe out the four pests and six diseases, achieve a hygienic county, and ensure a great leap in production." The battle call, like a spring thunder, resounded throughout the vast plains, the mountains with overlapping peaks, and the rolling hills. The land boiled, and 170,000 heroic people formed an invincible and unstoppable torrent, surging and roaring forward. In just a hundred days, they eliminated a large number of rats and mosquito pupae, and combined with spring fertilizer accumulation, cleared more than one million piles of garbage and dredged more than 490,000 square meters of ditches, totaling 1,500 li in length. These two items alone accumulated more than 10 million dan of fertilizer. All the original toilets, manure pits, pigsties, and cowsheds set up in the houses were moved to remote corners of the villages and merged to build public toilets and collective pigsties and cowsheds that meet hygiene requirements. This changed the unhygienic phenomenon of humans and animals living together.

    Now, the urban and rural environmental hygiene in Yujiang County has taken on a completely new look. A sense of freshness and cleanliness arises spontaneously. Who would have thought that this place, devastated by the god of plague of schistosomiasis and the Kuomintang reactionaries, this place that used to be full of garbage, swarming with mosquitoes and flies, and where various infectious diseases such as dysentery and malaria were prevalent all year round, would become so beautiful today. The ground around the villages is swept clean, flat and smooth, without a small puddle or a small mound; no garbage, no weeds. The trees surrounding the villages have every branch brushed with lime and sprayed with 666 pesticide, and all the tree holes are filled with yellow mud. The houses hidden in the lush forests are washed spotlessly. Although they are old wooden houses that have endured years of wind and rain, they have become radiant and youthful. The masses call this: "Houses taking a bath, tree trunks putting on powder." Entering the house, the atmosphere is even more different. The walls made of bricks or red stones are whitewashed with lime, the small windows are replaced with large windows, the indoor air is circulating, and the sunlight is sufficient; the large pieces of furniture that have been fixed for many years, such as cabinets, cupboards, and boxes, have also been moved and cleaned as if they were new, with clear colors, and arranged neatly and orderly. The relatively humid ground is covered with fine sand and dry soil, which is compacted, flat, and dry. The villages and houses throughout the county have truly achieved "six sides clean" indoors and "three no's left" outdoors. The so-called "three no's left" means leveling the depressions, dredging the ditches, and leaving no sludge or standing water; all the weeds in front of and behind the houses are cleared, leaving not a single one; the environmental hygiene is thoroughly cleaned, leaving no garbage. The so-called "six sides clean" refers to the cleanliness and hygiene of the indoor up, down, left, right, front, and back, without a speck of dust. Every household has a spittoon, everyone uses their own towel to wash their face, brushing their teeth in the morning and evening, washing their hands before meals and after using the toilet, and not spitting everywhere have become the new fashion of the whole people. Hygiene conventions are posted everywhere: "Protecting hygiene is everyone's responsibility, good health, and a leap in production." This is the common ideological foundation of the people of the county. Look, the cooks, who are strong and healthy, are all wearing spotless white work clothes, white hats, and masks. Hygiene equipment such as tableware disinfection boxes and fly-proof and dust-proof screens are almost all available. The canteen also implements separate serving of food and special bowls and chopsticks. The commune members have never eaten such clean, hygienic, delicious, and nutritious meals as they do today. No wonder they are all energetic and full of vigor. Every child in the nursery has their own special towel, handkerchief, and tableware. The nursery teachers are all young girls who have been trained and have a certain level of education and professional knowledge. They have generally learned to do eight things: morning check-ups, calisthenics, child care, epidemic reporting, making toys, teaching singing, dancing, and playing games. The old people who spend their old age in the nursing homes never forget to visit their little grandchildren in the kindergarten every day. Leaning on their crutches, they lean against the gate of the kindergarten, watching the children dancing and singing under the patient guidance of the nannies with great interest, and cannot help but feel: "The children now are really smart, at such a young age, they can dance and sing, all thanks to Chairman Mao!" In every village, there are diligent and loyal old people who are in charge of sanitation work. Before dawn, they carry manure baskets to collect wild manure and sweep the streets and toilets. All toilets have sheds and covers, are regularly stored, sealed to kill eggs, and you can't smell the odor, let alone see mosquitoes and flies.

    When we were vigorously carrying out the environmental hygiene improvement campaign, it was the busy season for spring plowing in the countryside. In order to do a good job in hygiene while ensuring good production, many places cooked rice in the third watch and went to work in the fourth watch; did production during the day and hygiene at night; and did production on sunny days and hygiene on rainy days. The two were organically combined and carried out alternately. More than 100 houses in Yangxi Brigade of Yangxi Commune were all cleaned up by the entire team in one night. On the night of March 11, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. In Fengshan Brigade of Shuangfeng Commune, the lights were flashing in every village and the voices of the people were boiling. Three thousand men, women, and children were enthusiastically carrying out the decisive battle to improve environmental hygiene. The road surface of the small market town of Shuangfeng Street was originally a deep, sunken yellow mud ground. After the rain, the yellow water overflowed and the mud was deep to the feet. Now it is covered with thick sand, making the road surface smooth and dry. Such an unprecedented movement is unthinkable without difficulties, but in the minds of the heroic people, it is not a big deal at all. Without wood and stones, people dismantled broken walls and rubble, piecing them together and using old materials in new ways; without stonemasons and carpenters, people started doing it themselves. As a result, what should be repaired was repaired, and what should be built was built, without asking the state or the commune for a penny. With the deepening of the nationwide patriotic health campaign, the improvement of the people's hygiene knowledge level, and the widespread formation of good hygiene habits, various diseases are rapidly shrinking or even disappearing from their "market." "May I ask where the God of Plague wants to go? Paper boats and candlelights illuminate the sky." Under the leadership of the Party, we will send away all the gods of plague. The beautiful wish of everyone living a healthy and civilized life will soon become a vivid reality.

    移风易俗　送尽瘟神
    中共江西余江县委书记　孙永久
    英雄的余江人民，在敬爱的领袖毛主席的光辉诗篇——“送瘟神二首”的鼓舞下，在取得根除血吸虫病伟大胜利的基础上，乘风扬帆，破浪疾进，采取大挖大铲，大建大改，大搞搬家、集中的方法，全面深入地开展了声势空前的除害灭病斗争，壮志凌云，干劲冲天，要叫四害绝迹，六病除尽。
    广大干部、群众，从几年来和各种病害作斗争的实践中，深深感到，要彻底实现除害灭病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造世界的伟大任务，必须大搞而不是小搞，必须治本而不仅仅是治标。县委总结了根除血吸虫病的经验，发出了气壮山河的口号：“全党全民动员，歼灭四害六病，实现卫生县，保证生产大跃进”。战斗的号角，像春雷般地响遍了辽阔的平原，响遍了峰峦重叠的山区，响遍了连绵起伏的丘陵地带。大地沸腾起来，十七万英雄人民，汇成了一股无坚不摧，猛不可挡的洪流，奔腾咆哮，滚滚前进。在短短百天时间里，消灭了大量老鼠、蚊蝇蛹，结合春季积肥，清除垃圾一百多万堆，疏通沟渠四十九万多平方米，长达一千五百华里，光这两项积攒的肥料就有一千多万担。所有原先设置在屋里的厕所、粪窖和猪栏、牛栏，全部搬到村子的僻角，合并起来，建起了符合卫生要求的公共厕所和集体猪栏、牛栏。改变了那种人畜共居的不卫生的现象。
    现在，余江全县城乡环境卫生面貌焕然一新，一种清新、整洁的感觉使人油然而生。谁能想到：被血吸虫瘟神和国民党反动派摧残得奄奄一息的地方，这个曾经到处是垃圾成堆，蚊蝇成群，痢疾、疟疾等各种传染病长年流行的地方，今天居然变得如此美丽。村子四周的地面，打扫得干干净净，平平坦坦，没有一个小污水坑，也没有一个小土丘；没有垃圾，也没有杂草。环绕村庄的林木，每根枝干都刷上了石灰，喷洒了六六六药水，树洞也全部用黄泥堵塞起来。掩映在茂林修竹中的住房，一栋栋洗刷得一尘不染，虽然是饱经风霜雨雪的古老的木房子，也变得光彩焕发，年青起来。群众把这叫做：“房屋洗澡，树干搽粉”。进到屋里，气象更有一番不同。砖或红石砌成的墙壁，用石灰粉刷得雪白，小窗户改成了大窗户，室内空气流通，阳光充足；多少年固定不动的大件家具，如橱子、柜子、箱子等，也都搬开打扫并且洗刷得像新的一样，色泽分明，摆设得整整齐齐，井然有序。比较潮湿的地面，铺上了细砂、干土，打得结结实实、平坦干爽。全县村落，房屋，真是做到了室内“六面光”，室外“三不留”。所谓“三不留”是指填平了洼地，疏通了沟渠，不留污泥、积水；屋前屋后杂草全部铲净，一根不留；环境卫生彻底打扫干净，不留一点垃圾。所谓“六面光”，是指室内上下左右前后，清洁卫生，一尘不染。家家户户设有痰盂，人人都用自己的毛巾洗脸，早晚刷牙、饭前便后洗手、不随地吐痰、便溺已成为全民的新风尚。到处张贴有卫生公约，“爱护卫生，人人有责，身体健康，生产跃进”，这是全县人民共同的思想基础。你看，身体健壮的炊事员，一个个身穿洁白的工作服，戴着白色的帽子和口罩。食具消毒箱，防蝇防尘纱罩等卫生设备，几乎应有尽有。食堂里也实行了分菜吃饭，碗筷专用。社员们从来没有过像今天这样吃着既清洁卫生而又味美营养的饭菜，无怪他们个个精力充沛，干劲十足。托儿所每个儿童都有自己专用的毛巾、手帕和食具，保育员都是经过培训，有一定文化水平和专业知识的青年姑娘，她们一般都学会了做八件事：晨间检查、广播操、儿童保健、疫情报告、制玩具、教歌唱、跳舞、做游戏。在敬老院里欢度晚年的老人，每天总忘不了到幼儿园去看看自己的小外孙。他们手扶拐杖，依在幼儿园的大门口，兴致勃勃地看着孩子们在阿姨的耐心教导下跳舞、唱歌，不禁若有所感地说：“现在的孩子真是聪明，点点年纪，又会跳舞，又会唱歌，这都是享毛主席的福啊！”。村村都有勤勤恳恳、忠忠实实的老人们专管卫生工作，天不亮他们就背着粪箕，捡拾野粪，打扫街道、厕所。所有的厕所都有棚有盖，定期贮存，密封杀卵，闻不到臭味，更看不到蚊蝇。
    我们大搞改造环境卫生运动的时候，正是农村备耕较忙的季节。为了在搞好生产的前提下搞好卫生工作，许多地方都是三更造饭，四更出勤；白天搞生产，晚上搞卫生；晴天搞生产，雨天搞卫生。两者有机地结合，交错地进行。杨溪公社杨溪大队一百多栋房屋，全队人马出动，一个晚上全部洗擦一新。3月11日晚上，月明星稀，双凤公社凤山大队，村村灯火闪闪，人声沸腾，三千名男女老少正在热烈地进行改造环境卫生的决战。双凤街小圩镇的路面，原来是个深陷的黄泥地，下雨以后，黄水漫流，泥深没脚，现在铺上了厚厚的沙子，把路面铺得既光洁又干爽。这样旷古的运动，不可能设想没有困难，但是在英雄人民的心目中，它根本就不算一回事。没有木料、石块，人们就拆残墙断壁，东拼西凑，旧料新用；没有石匠、木匠，人们就自己动手干起来，结果该修的修好了，该建的建起来了，没有要国家和公社的一文钱。各种疾病，随着全民性除害灭病运动的深入，随着人民卫生知识水平的提高和良好的卫生习惯的普遍形成，正迅速缩小以至消失它的“市场”。“借问瘟君欲何往？纸船明烛照天烧。”在党的领导下，我们将要送尽一切瘟神。人人都过健康、文明生活的美好愿望，即将成为活生生的现实了。
