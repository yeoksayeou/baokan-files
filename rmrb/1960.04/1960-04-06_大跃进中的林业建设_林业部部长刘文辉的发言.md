Forestry Construction in the Great Leap Forward
Speech by Liu Wenhui, Minister of Forestry

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now, I will speak on forestry construction in the Great Leap Forward, and I welcome your corrections.

Large-scale and High-speed Development of Forestry Production

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, People's Communes, China's forestry, like other economic sectors, has achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward since 1958.

First, in forestry: In 1958, the nation afforested 261.9 million mu, exceeding the total afforested area during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. In 1959, the leap forward continued, with 280 million mu afforested nationwide. Such large-scale and high-speed afforestation is not only unprecedented in China's history but also beyond the reach of the capitalist world. According to our understanding, the United States, which has consistently boasted of its economic and military strength and has engaged in blackmail everywhere, only afforested approximately 1.8 million mu from 1947 to 1957. The U.S. territory is only 18.3% smaller than China's, but its afforested area in ten years is 154 and a half times smaller than China's in 1959 alone.

China's afforestation is not only large in scale and fast in speed, but it has also established tens of thousands of forestry bases across the country, gradually leading forestry production towards a rational layout. For example, Hunan established 2,380 "Golden Dragon Mountain"-style forestry bases in all counties of the province; Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces established a large number of mine prop forest bases in mining areas. With these forestry bases, which are mainly for timber production and are large and concentrated, all parts of the country will gradually be able to achieve self-sufficiency in timber, and the state will not have to transport timber from thousands of miles away in the future. It is particularly worth mentioning that we have found the law of fast-growing and high-yielding timber in the Great Leap Forward and have summarized the experience of the masses' long-term production struggle to formulate a set of basic technical measures for timber cultivation and management (suitable species for suitable sites, meticulous land preparation, improved varieties and strong seedlings, appropriate close planting, tending and protection, tool reform, and necessary irrigation and fertilization), ensuring that trees grow quickly and well. For example, Chinese fir, even in the southern provinces, requires 25 years to mature. Now, because the masses have mastered the law of fast-growing and high-yielding timber and comprehensively implemented the above-mentioned basic technical measures, many places have achieved Chinese fir maturity in ten or eight years. In addition, various places have also cultivated eucalyptus trees that mature in seven years, paulownia trees that mature in six years, and poplar and locust trees that mature in five years. This is a major event of revolutionary significance in the history of forestry development. An old saying goes, "The predecessors plant trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade." This is no longer applicable in socialist New China.

China's forestry is developing in all aspects. Not only is afforestation experiencing a Great Leap Forward, but the management and utilization of forests and tending and protection have also achieved great successes. While vigorously increasing timber production, we have implemented the policy of combining felling and cultivation, updating as we cut down, planting more than we cut down, with the area of replanting after logging in 1959 exceeding the planned felling area by more than 250%; in the afforestation movement, we promoted the system of contracting for planting, survival, and maturity, and immediately after afforestation, we carried out tending work, so the general survival rate was high, and growth was good; in forest protection, we widely and deeply carried out forest fire prevention movements and actively prevented and controlled diseases and insect pests. According to incomplete statistics, in 1959, 560 counties basically controlled forest fires, and 149 counties basically eliminated one or several major forest insect pests; especially in the production and management of forest areas, we implemented the policy of focusing on forestry and engaging in multiple operations, vigorously developing sideline production on the basis of vigorously developing forestry, and using the income from short-term sideline production to support the long-term development of forestry production. This ensures the continuous Great Leap Forward in forestry construction. In addition, since the Great Leap Forward, two large-scale "small autumn harvest" movements have also been carried out in mountainous areas across the country, achieving great successes. In 1958, the total value of mountain forest by-products reached 3.7 billion yuan, and in 1959, it increased by 27% compared to 1958. This has played a positive role in promoting forestry production, prospering the mountain economy, and supporting national construction.

The Great Leap Forward in forestry construction has also played a due role in the bumper harvest of agricultural production. For example, the old course of the Yellow River in eastern Henan was once a barren land with flying sand. Now, it is covered with forest belts and forest networks, which, together with other engineering measures, have protected 5 million mu of farmland from the harm of wind and sand, and the yield per unit area has increased several times; more than 400,000 mu of sandy wasteland have also been reclaimed, increasing grain production by more than 100 million jin per year. As a result, the natural and economic features of eastern Henan have undergone tremendous changes.

The achievements of China's forestry construction have encouraged the people of the whole country and have also aroused great attention from the capitalist world. For example, the French forester Jean Messina, who visited China's forestry, published an article in the "United Nations Forestry" magazine saying, "This is a forestry revolution," "It is difficult to say that there is any country in the world that has adopted such a grand, orderly, and planned forestry policy as China." Indeed, the aging capitalist world has no strength to compete with our socialist country in the struggle to conquer nature.

Secondly, in terms of the forest industry: In 1958, 35 million cubic meters of timber were produced, exceeding the Second Five-Year Plan's target for 1962 of producing 31 million to 34 million cubic meters of raw timber four years ahead of schedule. In 1959, 41.2 million cubic meters of timber were produced, an increase of 18% compared to 1958. This basically guaranteed the needs of national construction for timber. In old China, imported sleepers were needed to build railways, and important forest products used in industry had to be imported from abroad. Even building a decent house in major coastal cities depended on foreign timber. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, even some daily furniture used by those wealthy families could not be separated from imported goods. In the first decade of socialist construction in New China, the railways open to traffic developed to more than 32,000 kilometers, without importing a single sleeper; coal production increased to 347.8 million tons, without importing a single mine prop; large-scale aircraft, automobile, shipbuilding, and papermaking industries were established, and thousands of magnificent high-rise buildings were built, without importing an inch of timber. New China and old China are two completely different worlds.

The Great Leap Forward in timber production has promoted the great development of comprehensive timber utilization. The timber processing industry and the forest chemical industry have blossomed all over the country. From the perspective of the timber processing industry: a little over a year ago, China did not have a fiberboard industry. By the end of 1959, there were more than 300 fiberboard factories combining indigenous and foreign methods, with a production capacity of more than 130,000 tons. Capitalist countries such as the United States and Sweden took ten years to build a production capacity of 100,000 tons of fiberboard. With the great development of fiberboard production, the production of other various types of artificial boards has also made rapid progress. From the world-renowned Ten Great Buildings of Beijing, one can see how high the level of China's artificial board industry has reached. The forest chemical industry has also developed rapidly. It was only started in 1958, and now 20,250 various forest chemical plants have been established, mainly using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods, with more than 100 products, and the quality is constantly improving. For example, high-grade rosin used in industry was completely dependent on imports before liberation. Now, China can supply the needs of 40 domestic industries and 600 kinds of industrial products, and its export volume ranks third in the world. Such high-speed development is also unprecedented in the history of the development of the forest chemical industry in the capitalist world.

In order to comprehensively develop and utilize forest resources and increase timber production, the state has built 180 kilometers of heavy-rail railways, 1,164 kilometers of forest narrow-gauge railways, 14,595 kilometers of highways, and forest industrial buildings with a floor area of 3.06 million square meters for forestry production services. In addition, the state and people's communes have also built thousands of kilometers of various types of wooden rails, chutes, cableways, canals, etc. This has greatly increased the production capacity of the forest industry. In some remote mountainous areas, new-type forestry cities have emerged.

With the continuous Great Leap Forward in production and construction, forestry scientific research and forestry education have also made great developments. Now, there are 14 higher forestry schools in the country, 13 forestry departments in various agricultural colleges, with 12,447 students; 61 secondary forestry schools, with 25,419 students; in addition, there are 1,100 forestry middle schools, with 100,000 students. In old China, there was never a higher education institution specializing in training forestry talents, and before liberation, there were only 541 students in forestry departments. There are 31 forestry scientific research institutions at the central and provincial and municipal levels alone, with 3,800 scientific research personnel. A mass movement of vigorously engaging in scientific research and everyone learning culture and every farm running a forestry school has been widely carried out in vast forest areas. A huge contingent of forestry scientists and technicians who are both red and expert is rapidly growing.

All this shows that the development speed and the magnitude of achievements of forestry construction in the Great Leap Forward are unprecedented. This is a victory of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, a victory of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and also the result of the joint efforts of forestry workers and the broad masses of people across the country.

Main Experiences of the Continuous Great Leap Forward in Forestry Construction

In the practice of the continuous Great Leap Forward in forestry construction, we have gained rich experience. The most important of these is:

First, strengthening the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, opposing right-leaning tendencies, and boosting morale are the fundamental guarantees for achieving a continuous Great Leap Forward.

The practice of the past two years has fully proven that ideology has a huge impact on productivity. Since 1958, under the illumination of the General Line, and encouraged by Chairman Mao's great call to gardenize the land, Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over forestry work, carried out extensive forestry propaganda and education, overcome various right-leaning ideas, and many Party committee secretaries have taken the lead in going to the mountains to plant trees, which has greatly inspired the afforestation enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. They all set high ambitions and boosted their morale, marching towards barren mountains, bald ridges, and desert Gobi. One movement after another, one upsurge after another. In 1958, 33 counties in Guizhou Province mobilized 800,000 people to go to the mountains to set up camps and plant trees in one go; in the winter afforestation movement in Henan Province in 1959, 7.7 million people were mobilized to plant trees; Zhangye Prefecture in Gansu Province mobilized the entire region, organizing an afforestation army of 700,000 people to build a "Green Great Wall" consisting of three parts and totaling more than 5,000 kilometers in length along the northwestern part of the ancient Great Wall and the edge of the Tengger Desert. In the past, the people of Hexi lamented, "When you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes are always filled with tears. When you look ahead, it is the Gobi Desert; when you look back, it is the Gate of Hell." Today, they sing with heroic feelings, "The Green Great Wall exceeds ten thousand li, the petty Qin Emperor lowers his head, three thousand willows are just a drop in the ocean, today the spring breeze blows all over Hexi." The epic of China's forestry Great Leap Forward was written by hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of the Party in the mass movement with soaring revolutionary zeal.

Many vivid facts tell us: "Without a vigorous movement, there is no way to find the masses; without drive, one cannot oppose right-leaning tendencies." In the first half of 1959, right-leaning and lax sentiments appeared among some cadres, and the progress of completing the plan was slow, and even after the plan was implemented, there was still a lack of firm confidence in completing the task. However, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, forestry workers across the country immediately took action under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, setting off a new upsurge of production and construction that was both comprehensive and sustained, both vigorous and solid, on the entire forestry front. From August onwards, the figures for completing the plan rose in a straight line, refreshing every month. In terms of timber production: August increased by 10.1% compared to July, and September increased by 24.4% compared to August, completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. In terms of capital construction: from January to July, only 33.8% of the total annual investment was completed, and 66.2% was completed in the five months from August to December. Moreover, all production departments of the forestry system achieved a "red start" in 1960. This is truly immediate. As long as politics are put in command, and the mass movement is launched, the masses' enthusiasm will surge in, and production achievements will rise steadily.

Second, resolutely implementing the General Line and the policy of walking on two legs, forestry construction will leap again and again, and the leaps will be higher and higher.

The practice of the past two years has fully proven that the Party's General Line and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, which embody the General Line, have invincible power on all fronts of socialist construction. When we started comprehensive timber utilization centered on fiberboard in 1958, we had neither equipment nor technology. At that time, some people with right-leaning ideas emphasized importing equipment and only wanted to do big things and foreign things. In fact, this was a wavering of the General Line and the policy of walking on two legs. We launched a struggle against this right-leaning idea and resolutely implemented the policy of focusing on small-scale, combining large, medium, and small, focusing on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and improving after starting. Practice has clearly affirmed that the right-leaning idea of emphasizing the major and belittling the minor, emphasizing the foreign and belittling the indigenous is wrong, and adhering to the policy of walking on two legs is correct. In just over a year, our timber processing industry and forest chemical industry have been scattered all over the country, forming a magnificent picture of tens of thousands of horses galloping forward. For example, the forestry system in Heilongjiang Province has independently established more than 700 medium-sized, small-sized, indigenous and foreign combined timber processing factories and forest chemical plants, with 59 products and a total production value of more than 210 million yuan; Zhejiang Province has established 1,750 forest chemical plants using indigenous methods, and almost all people's communes in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas have established forest chemical plants, with a total production value of 70 million yuan in 1959; Tang County, Hebei, is a plain area that does not produce timber. All ten people's communes in the county have also started fiberboard factories using indigenous methods, using wheat straw, cotton stalks, hemp stalks, weeds, etc. as raw materials, and vigorously engaged in fiberboard production, which not only solved part of the self-use timber, but also transferred part to support national construction, which set a good example for the people's communes across the country to vigorously engage in fiberboard industry. From the leaping development of the timber processing industry and the forest chemical industry, people clearly see the strong vitality and incomparable superiority of the General Line and the policy of walking on two legs. Therefore, the masses in Heilongjiang Province sing, "The Xing'an Mountains stretch endlessly, treasures are buried for thousands of years, today we have the General Line, ordering the mountains to offer treasures to the world."

Third, the people's communes have created extremely favorable conditions and opened up broad roads for forestry construction.

The practice of the past two years has fully proven that when an advanced superstructure is combined with an advanced economic base, productivity will inevitably develop by leaps and bounds. The superiority of the people's communes is manifested in forestry construction in this way. In 1958, the rural areas realized the people's communes, and forestry construction unfolded a new stage of leaping development. First, because the people's commune is a basic social organization that combines government and commune, industry and agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and comprehensively manages agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, it implements unified leadership and overall planning in developing production, and can rationally utilize land, manpower, and material resources. Therefore, the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry competing for land and manpower, which could not be completely resolved during the agricultural cooperative period, has been resolved, which is conducive to the rapid development of forestry production. Secondly, because the people's commune has more people and greater strength, it can accelerate the greening of large areas of barren mountains and wastelands, develop remote forest areas, and rationally utilize forest resources. For example, the Taiping People's Commune in Zhao'an County, Fujian, reclaimed and afforested and planted fruit trees and other crops on more than 63,000 mu in 1959 alone, developing and managing more than 90% of the barren mountains. Thirdly, because the people's commune is a comprehensive manager of multiple economic undertakings and implements division of labor and specialization, it is conducive to the establishment of forestry professional organizations. Now, there are more than 70,000 forestry farms run by communes and teams across the country, which means that we already have a strong forestry industrial army to regularly manage forestry. This will inevitably lead to faster development of forestry production and better utilization of forest resources. Therefore, the masses say, "The people's commune has added wings to forestry, flying faster and leaping higher."

Fourth, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution is an important way to promote the leaping progress of forestry construction.

The practice of the past two years has fully proven that as long as we break superstitions, liberate our minds, and the infinite wisdom hidden among the masses will flow like a spring, forming a torrent of technological revolution and promoting the continuous upsurge of production and construction. Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the call to break superstitions and liberate our minds, the subjective initiative of forestry workers across the country has been unprecedentedly unleashed, and the flowers of technological innovation have bloomed all over the forestry front. In 1959 alone, more than 1,000 new tools were created, improved, and promoted across the country. These new tools generally improve work efficiency by about one time, some by several times, and even dozens of times. This greatly reduces heavy manual labor, reduces the obstacles of nature to production, and improves labor productivity, providing a strong guarantee for the sustained Great Leap Forward in production and construction. Now, hundreds of thousands of loggers across the country have basically discarded their axes and realized sawing, one person topping several people, one field topping several fields; the collection of timber in forest areas has basically realized cableway and chute transportation. In the past, it was "thousands of trees and wood pressing on both shoulders, sweating and aching waist and legs," but now it is "one cable hanging on Motianling, endless timber rolling in," calling the dangerous and majestic mountains to obediently serve the people; we are vigorously making automobile and train transport of timber, one automobile can drag two to four sections, and at most twelve sections, with a transport capacity of forty to fifty cubic meters, while abroad, generally one automobile can only drag one trailer, with a transport capacity of only five to ten cubic meters; China's sea rafting averages five to ten cubic meters of timber per horsepower, with a speed of two to six nautical miles per hour, catching up with the highest transport capacity and speed of sea rafting abroad; the fiberboard production of the Tianjin Timber Factory started with indigenous methods only a little over a year ago, and has already achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, becoming a pacesetter for the national fiberboard "small foreign group"; the medium-sized indigenous single-board gas dryer designed and trial-produced by the Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1 costs 75% less and is 40% more efficient than the foreign equipment manufactured in West Germany.

The technological innovation and technological revolution on our forestry front involve both large and small, indigenous and foreign, not only tool reform and indigenous machines, but also marching towards "high, large, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new" products. The advanced, large-scale, precision, cutting-edge, and new-style products that we manufacture or are preparing to manufacture have already begun or will soon begin to supply the needs of industrial production. Some products have long been renowned in the international market. At present, a magnificent technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being carried out continuously and deeply in the vast forest areas, striving to change the backward state of China's forestry production technology as soon as possible and step onto the advanced level in the world.

We believe that the above-mentioned experiences can be concentrated on one point, that is: resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. Chairman Mao's great thought, like a lighthouse, illuminates the road for 600 million people to advance from revolution to construction, from socialism to communism. As long as we earnestly study Chairman Mao's works and strive to learn and master the great ideological weapons that Chairman Mao has taught us, we will be invincible and successful in everything.

Glorious Tasks of the Forestry Front in the New Situation

The forestry construction since the Great Leap Forward is like a thousand sails racing and ten thousand trees vying for prosperity, greatly changing the natural features of the motherland, playing a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural construction, and laying a good foundation for future sustained Great Leap Forward. This is the mainstream. However, forestry is still a weak link in the entire national economy, and it is not completely adapted to the ever-increasing demands of socialist construction for forestry. The situation requires us to: under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold even higher the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, carry out mass afforestation and silviculture movements more widely and deeply, accelerate the greening of all possible barren mountains and wastelands and beside villages, houses, roads, and waters, realize the "National Agricultural Development Program" for greening the motherland ahead of schedule, and gradually realize Chairman Mao's great ideal of gardening the land; at the same time, comprehensively develop and utilize existing forest resources, vigorously develop the production of timber and forest by-products to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction. This is the general task of forestry construction, and it is also the general goal for which our national forestry workers and the broad masses of people are striving.

According to this general task, in 1960, we will mainly do the following two aspects of work, and realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward in forestry through these two aspects of work.

(1) In forestry: With the consolidation, improvement, and development of commune-run forestry farms and state-owned forestry farms as the center, actively realize the basification of forestry production, the farmification of forestry management, and the rapid growth and high yield of timber cultivation, pushing the mass movement of forestry construction to a new stage.

The basification of forestry production, the farmification of forestry management, and the rapid growth and high yield of timber cultivation are the direction of China's forestry development, and they also mark a new stage in China's forestry construction.

The basification of forestry production is to, according to the requirements of national economic development and the characteristics of various places, use the favorable conditions of the people's communes, through planning and design, rationally arrange the layout of forestry production, delineate areas, concentrate into large areas, and afforest and cultivate forests in a planned way. The farmification of forestry management is to establish forestry farms in places with afforestation and silviculture tasks, set up full-time personnel, organize professional teams, and strengthen the management and operation of timber. The rapid growth and high yield of timber cultivation is to, in the process of afforestation and silviculture, implement the basic technical measures for timber cultivation and management, accelerate the growth of timber, mature or bear fruit ahead of schedule, and increase the yield per unit area.

The "three-izations" of forestry are the product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In the process of promoting the "three-izations" of forestry, it will inevitably promote the continued Great Leap Forward in forestry. Our slogan is: every forestry product has a base, every base has a forestry farm, and every forestry farm achieves high yield. We can foresee that what will inevitably follow is: the rapid expansion of forest resources, the gradual balance of forest distribution, and the rapid modernization of the entire forestry.

(2) In the forest industry: Vigorously increase timber production and vigorously engage in comprehensive timber utilization centered on fiberboard at the same time, striving to guarantee the country's needs for timber and forest by-products.

Timber plays a very important role in the national economy. With the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction and the great improvement in people's lives, the demand for timber and forest by-products, especially timber, is increasing day by day. Therefore, our primary task is to increase timber production and strive to achieve a greater increase in timber production in every possible way. Our efforts to achieve this are: first, to give full play to the production potential of existing logging enterprises; second, to actively strengthen capital construction and develop undeveloped forest resources. In addition to continuing to develop the forest areas in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, we must also develop the forest areas in Sichuan and Fujian and the Qinling forest areas in Shaanxi. Let the deep mountain treasures that have been sleeping for hundreds of years quickly serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

While vigorously increasing timber production, vigorously engage in comprehensive timber utilization centered on artificial boards. This is of great significance for fully utilizing forest resources and resolving the current contradiction between timber production and supply. Because timber is not only large in quantity, but also contains a variety of substances, which can produce a variety of products to meet the diverse needs of industrial production; at the same time, the forest resources left over from old China are not too many, and China's current timber utilization rate is not very high, and a large amount of waste materials are left over from logging, processing, and urban timber processing in forest areas across the country. If these waste materials, and even tree roots, bark, leaves, and sap, are all utilized through physical and chemical reprocessing to make various artificial boards and forest chemical products to replace the use of logs or as raw materials for industrial production, then it is equivalent to increasing a large amount of timber production for the country, and it is also conducive to the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial production.

In the comprehensive utilization of timber, developing the fiberboard industry is particularly important. Because fiberboard production is the main way to fully utilize waste materials and improve the timber utilization rate. Three million cubic meters of waste materials, made into fiberboard, can replace the use of five million cubic meters of logs; the raw materials used are also the most extensive, that is, various wood fibers can be used, and various herbaceous plant fibers can also be used. Whether in forest areas or timber-deficient areas, fiberboard can be vigorously produced. At the same time, fiberboard has an extremely wide range of uses, such as: decoration of houses and vehicles and ships, manufacturing of furniture and daily necessities, and packaging of industrial and agricultural products, etc., with a total of more than 300 uses. Therefore, vigorously developing the fiberboard industry has become the most important task on the forestry front.

The tasks on our forestry front are glorious and arduous at the same time. We have decided to continue to adhere to putting politics in command under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, further vigorously carry out mass movements, resolutely implement the General Line and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution; and in specific measures, strengthen capital construction, improve enterprise management, systematically summarize, improve, and promote advanced experience, implement the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," mobilize all positive factors, and push the socialist forestry construction cause forward wave after wave. At present, the situation of China's economic construction is very good, and there are more favorable conditions than at any time in the past. We have full confidence that we will definitely be able to successfully complete the tasks assigned to us by the country, realize the "National Agricultural Development Program" for greening the motherland ahead of schedule, and gradually realize the gardening of the motherland in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. We live in the great Mao Zedong era, which is truly full of hope, light, happiness, and pride.

Let us all unite more firmly and, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, work harder and harder, and leap forward and leap forward again.

    大跃进中的林业建设
    林业部部长刘文辉的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，并完全同意全国人大常委会的工作报告。
    现在，我就大跃进中的林业建设发言，请予指正：
    林业生产大规模、高速度地发展
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我国的林业和其他经济部门一样，从1958年以来，连续实现了全面的大跃进。
    首先，在林业方面：1958年全国造林二亿六千一百九十万亩，超过了第一个五年计划时期全国造林面积的总和。1959年继续跃进，全国造林二亿八千万亩。像这样大规模高速度的造林，不仅在我国是亘古未有，而且在资本主义世界也是望尘莫及的。据我们了解，一贯吹嘘其经济军事实力到处讹诈的美国，从1947年到1957年仅造林约一百八十万亩。美国国土比我国只小18.3％，但是它十年的造林面积却比我国1959年一年的造林面积小一百五十四倍半。
    我国造林，不单是规模大、速度快，而且在全国各地建立了数以万计的林业基地，使林业生产逐步走向合理的布局。例如：湖南在全省各县建立了二千三百八十个“金龙山”式的林业基地，河北、江苏、安徽等省在矿区建立了大批的矿柱林基地。有了这种以用材林为主、大面积集中成片的林业基地，全国各地逐步都能做到木材自给，国家将来就不必迢迢千里调运木材了。值得特别提出的是：我们在跃进中已经找到了林木速生丰产的规律，并总结群众长期生产斗争的经验订出了一套林木培育管理的基本技术措施（适地适树、细致整地、良种壮苗、适当密植、抚育保护、改革工具、必要的灌水施肥），保证林木长得又快又好。比如杉木，即使在南方各省也需要二十五年才能成材。现在，由于群众掌握了林木速生丰产规律，全面地执行了上述基本技术措施，很多地方实现了杉木十年、八年成材。此外，各地还培育成了七年成材的桉树，六年成树的泡桐，五年成材的杨树和洋槐等。这是林业发展史上的一件具有革命意义的大事。古语说：“前人种树，后人遮荫”。这在社会主义的新中国已经不适用了。
    我国的林业是全面发展的。不仅造林是大跃进，森林的经营利用和抚育保护也取得了巨大成绩。我们在大力增产木材的同时，贯彻了采育结合的方针，随砍伐随更新，砍得多栽得更多，1959年迹地更新面积超过了计划采伐面积的250％以上；在造林运动中，推行了包栽包活、包成林的制度，造林以后随即展开了抚育工作，因而一般成活率高，生长得好；在森林保护上，广泛和深入地开展了护林防火运动和积极防治病虫害。据不完全的统计，1959年有五百六十个县基本上控制了森林火灾，一百四十九个县基本上消灭了一种或几种主要森林虫害；特别是在林区生产经营上，贯彻了以林为主、多种经营的方针，在大力发展林业的基础上大搞副业生产，以副业短期性生产的收入，去支持林业长期性生产的发展。这就保证了林业建设的持续大跃进。此外，大跃进以来，还在全国山区开展了两次声势浩大的“小秋收”运动，取得了巨大成绩。1958年山林副产品总值达三十七亿元，1959年又比1958年增长27％。这对促进林业生产、繁荣山区经济和支援国家建设起了积极的作用。
    林业建设的大跃进对农业生产的大丰收，也起了应有的作用。例如：豫东黄河故道，过去是一个飞沙不毛之地。现在正布满了林带和林网，配合其他工程措施，使五百万亩农田免除了风沙的危害，单位面积产量成倍地增长；还开垦了四十多万亩沙荒，每年增产粮食一亿多斤。因而豫东地区的自然面貌和经济面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    我国林业建设的成就，鼓舞了全国人民，同时也引起了资本主义世界的极大注意。如曾来我国参观林业的法国林学家约翰·梅西纳在“联合国林业”杂志上发表文章说：“这是林业革命”，“很难说世界上还有那一个国家所采取的林业政策像中国这样宏伟，这样有条理，有计划。”的确，已经衰老了的资本主义世界，在征服大自然的斗争中，是没有力量和我们社会主义国家竞赛的。
    其次，在森林工业方面：1958年生产木材三千五百万立方米，提前四年超额完成了第二个五年计划规定1962年生产原木三千一百万至三千四百万立方米的指标，1959年生产木材四千一百二十万立方米，比1958年增长18％。这就基本上保证了国家建设对木材的需要。在旧中国修铁路要用外国的枕木，工业上用的重要林产品要从外国输入，沿海各大城市盖一座像样的房子也要仰给于外国的木材，国民党反动统治时期的那些豪门甚至连日常用的一些家具离不开舶来品。新中国在社会主义建设的第一个十年里，通车的铁路发展到三万二千多公里，没有从外国输入一根枕木；煤的产量增加到三亿四千七百八十万吨，没有从外国输入一根矿柱；建立了大规模的飞机、汽车、造船、制纸工业，修起了成千上万座富丽堂皇的高楼大厦，没有从外国输入一寸木材，新中国和旧中国，完全是两个截然不同的世界。
    木材生产的大跃进，促进了木材综合利用的大发展。木材加工工业和林产化学工业在全国遍地开花，万紫千红。从木材加工工业来说：一年多以前，我国还没有纤维板工业，到1959年底，全国已有三百多座土洋结合的纤维板制造厂，生产能力达十三万多吨。而资本主义国家如美国和瑞典曾用了十年才建成十万吨纤维板的生产能力。随着纤维板生产的大发展，其他各种人造板的生产也是突飞猛进，从举世闻名的北京十大建筑就可以看到我国人造板工业达到了怎样高的水平。林产化学工业也是飞跃的发展。1958年才兴办，现已建立以土为主土洋结合的各种林化工厂二万零二百五十处，产品达一百余种，质量也是不断地提高。比如工业上用的高级松香，解放前是完全仰给于外国，现在我国已能供应国内四十个行业、六百种工业产品的需要，出口量居世界第三位。这样高速度的发展，也是资本主义世界林化工业发展历史上所未有的。
    为了全面开发利用森林资源、增加木材生产，国家修筑了为林业生产服务的重轨铁路一百八十公里，森林窄轨铁路一千一百六十四公里，公路一万四千五百九十五公里，森工房屋建筑面积达三百零六万平方米。此外，国家和人民公社还修筑了数以千公里计的多种多样的木轨道、滑道、索道、渠道等。这就大大地增加了森林工业的生产能力。有些荒僻的山区，出现了新型的林业城市。
    随着生产建设的连续大跃进，林业科学研究和林业教育也有巨大的发展。现在，全国设有高等林业学校十四所，各农学院设有林学系十三个，在校学生一万二千四百四十七人；中等林业学校六十一所，在校学生二万五千四百一十九人；此外，还设有林业中学一千一百所，在校学生达十万人，而旧中国从来没有一所专门培养林业人材的高等学校，解放前林学系学生仅有五百四十一人。林业科学研究机构，光是中央和省市一级就有三十一所，科学研究人员达三千八百人。广大林区普遍开展大搞科学研究和人人学文化、场场办林校的群众运动。一支庞大的又红又专的林业科学技术队伍正在迅速地成长起来。
    这一切说明了，大跃进中的林业建设，发展的速度和成就的巨大是空前未有的。这是党和毛主席领导的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的胜利，同时也是全国林业职工和广大人民共同努力的结果。
    林业建设连续大跃进的主要经验
    在林业建设连续大跃进的实践中，我们取得了丰富的经验。其中最主要的是：
    第一，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，反右倾，鼓干劲，是实现连续大跃进的根本保证。
    两年来的实践充分证明：意识形态对生产力有巨大的影响。1958年以来，在总路线的照耀下，在毛主席提出大地园林化伟大号召的鼓舞下，各级党委进一步加强了对林业工作的领导，进行了广泛的林业宣传教育，克服了各种各样的右倾思想，同时许多党委书记带头上山造林，从而大大地鼓舞了广大群众的造林积极性。他们人人树雄心，个个鼓干劲，向荒山秃岭和沙漠戈壁大进军。运动一个接一个，高潮一浪跨一浪。贵州省1958年有三十三个县，一次动员群众八十万人上山安营扎寨造林；河南省1959年冬季造林运动动员了群众七百七十万人造林；甘肃张掖专区全区动员，组织七十万造林大军，在沿河西北部古长城与腾格里沙漠边沿，营造了一条由三部分组成总长五千多公里的“万里绿色长城”。河西人民群众过去悲叹：“出了嘉峪关，两眼泪不干，往前看戈壁滩，往后看鬼门关”。今天他们以豪迈的心情歌唱：“绿色长城超万里，渺小秦皇把头低，三千杨柳沧海粟，今日春风遍河西”。我国林业大跃进的史诗，就是党领导下的亿万人民在千军万马的群众运动中用冲天的革命干劲写成的。
    许多生动的事实告诉我们：“没有声势搞运动，没有办法找群众，没有干劲反右倾”。1959年上半年在一部分干部中出现了右倾松劲情绪，完成计划的进度较慢，经过计划落实仍然缺乏完成任务的坚定信心。但是党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约群众运动的号召以后，全国林业职工在各级党委的领导下立即行动起来，在整个林业战线上掀起了一个既全面又持续、既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的生产建设新高潮。从8月份起，完成计划的数字直线上升，月月刷新。木材生产方面：8月比7月增长10.1％，9月又比8月增长24.4％，提前超额完成了全年计划。基本建设方面：1至7月只完成全年投资总额的33.8％，8至12月五个月就完成66.2％。而且林业系统的各个生产部门都在1960年实现了“开门红”。这真是立竿见影。只要政治挂了帅，把群众运动搞起来，群众的干劲就滚滚而来，生产成绩就蒸蒸日上。
    第二，坚决贯彻执行总路线和两条腿走路的方针，林业建设就一跃再跃，越跃越高。
    两年来的实践充分证明：党的总路线和体现总路线的一整套两条腿走路的方针，在社会主义建设的一切战线上都具有战无不胜、攻无不克的威力。我们在1958年开始搞以纤维板为中心的木材综合利用时，一无设备，二无技术。当时一些有右倾思想的人，强调进口设备，只想搞大的，搞洋的。实际上就是对总路线和两条腿走路的方针发生动摇。我们对这种右倾思想展开了斗争，坚决贯彻执行了以小型为主大中小结合、土法为主土洋结合、先上马后提高的方针，除了建立一批大型的工厂作为骨干外，广泛发动群众，大搞小土群，小洋群。生活已经明确地肯定：重大轻小、重洋轻土的右倾思想是错误的，坚持两条腿走路的方针是正确的。仅一年多一点时间，我们的木材加工工业和林产化学工业已在全国星罗棋布，构成一幅壮丽的万马奔腾的跃进图。例如：黑龙江省林业系统已自力更生建立起中小型、土洋结合的木材加工厂和林业化工厂达七百多处，产品达五十九种，生产总值达二亿一千多万元；浙江省建立了土法林化工厂一千七百五十个，山区半山区的人民公社几乎都办了林化厂，1959年生产总值达七千万元；河北唐县是一个不产木材的平原地区，全县十个人民公社也统通办起土法纤维板制造厂，用麦秆、棉秆、麻秆、杂草等作原料，大搞纤维板生产，不仅解决了部分自用材，还外调一部分支援国家建设，这更为全国人民公社大搞纤维板工业树立了良好的榜样。从木材加工工业和林化工业这样飞跃的发展，人们清楚地看到了总路线和两条腿走路方针的强大生命力和无比优越性。所以黑龙江省群众歌唱：“兴安峻岭长绵绵，宝藏埋上几千年，今朝有了总路线，令山奉宝献人间。”
    第三，人民公社化，为林业建设创造了极其有利的条件和开辟了广阔的道路。
    两年来的实践充分证明：先进的上层建筑一同先进的经济基础结合起来，生产力就必然随之而飞跃发展。人民公社的优越性表现在林业建设上正是这样。1958年农村实现人民公社化，林业建设就展开了一个飞跃发展的新阶段。首先由于人民公社是政社合一、工农商学兵互相结合、农林牧副渔综合经营的社会基层组织，它在发展生产上是实行统一领导、全面规划，可以合理利用土地、人力和物力，因此，在农业合作社时期所不能完全解决的农林牧争土地和争人力的矛盾得到了解决，这就有利于林业生产的迅速发展。其次由于人民公社人多力量大，可以加速绿化大面积的荒山荒地，可以开发偏远林区和合理利用森林资源。比如福建诏安县太平人民公社，1959年一年就开荒造林和种植果树等六万三千多亩，把90％以上的荒山开发经营起来。再其次由于人民公社是多种经济事业的综合经营者，又实行了分工分业，这就有利于建立林业专业组织。现在，全国社队办林场已有七万多个，就是说，我们已经有了一支强大的林业产业军来经常经营林业。这就必然使林业生产得到更快的发展，森林资源得到更好的利用。因此，群众说：“人民公社给林业添上了翅膀，飞得更快，跃得更高。”
    第四，大搞技术革新和技术革命，是推动林业建设飞跃前进的重要途径。
    两年来的实践充分证明：只要破除迷信，解放思想，群众中蕴藏着的无穷智慧，就如源泉滚滚，汇成技术革命的洪流，推动生产建设的不断高涨。自从党中央和毛主席提出破除迷信、解放思想的号召以来，全国林业职工的主观能动性得到了空前的发挥，技术革新的花朵开遍整个林业战线。仅1959年全国创造、改进和推广的新工具就有一千多项。这些新工具一般提高工效一倍左右，有的几倍，甚至有几十倍。从而大大地减轻了笨重的体力劳动，减少了大自然对生产的障碍，提高了劳动生产率，为生产建设持续大跃进提供了有力的保证。现在，全国几十万采伐工人基本上丢掉了斧头，实现了锯子化，一个人顶几个人，一个场顶几个场；林区集材基本上实现了索道化、滑道化，过去是“千树万木压双肩，汗流浃背腰腿酸”，于今是“一索挂上摩天岭，不尽木材滚滚来”，叫险恶的崇山峻岭驯顺地服务于人民；我们大闹汽车列车运材，一辆汽车可拖二至四节，最多可拖十二节，运量达四十到五十立方米，而国外一般一辆汽车只能拖一辆挂车，运量只有五到十立方米；我国海排平均每匹马力运五到十立方米木材，速度每小时二至六海里，赶上了国外海排最高的运量和速度；天津木材厂的纤维板生产，土法上马才一年多，已经作到了机械化和半机械化，成为全国纤维板“小洋群”的标兵；上海木材一厂设计试制的中型土法单板瓦斯干燥机，比西德制造的洋设备，成本低75％，效率高40％。
    我们林业战线上的技术革新和技术革命，是大小一起来，土洋一齐动，既搞工具改革和土机器，同时又向“高大精尖新”进军。我们制造或准备制造的高级、大型、精密、尖端和新花色产品，已经或即将开始供应工业生产上的需要。有的产品，早已驰誉于国际市场。目前，一个波澜壮阔的以实现机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在广大林区持续和深入地开展着，力争尽快地改变我国林业生产技术的落后面貌，跨上世界的先进水平。
    上述这些经验，我们体会，可以集中到一点，就是：坚决贯彻马克思列宁主义与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想。毛主席的伟大思想，像灯塔一样，照亮了六亿人民从革命到建设、从社会主义到共产主义的前进道路。只要我们认真学习毛主席的著作，努力学会掌握毛主席教给我们的伟大思想武器，就无往而不胜，无功而不成。
    新形势下林业战线的光荣任务
    大跃进以来的林业建设，是千帆竞发，万木争荣，使祖国的自然面貌大为改观，对支援工农业建设起到了显著的作用，为今后的持续大跃进奠立了良好的基础。这是主流。但是林业在整个国民经济中还是一个薄弱环节，与社会主义建设事业对林业日益增高的要求，还是不完全相适应的。形势要求我们：在党中央和毛主席的领导下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，更广泛深入地开展群众造林、育林运动，加速绿化一切可能绿化的荒山荒地和村旁、宅旁、路旁、水旁，提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”对于绿化祖国的要求，并逐步实现毛主席提出的大地园林化的伟大理想；与此同时，全面开发和综合利用现有森林资源，大力发展木材和林副产品的生产，以满足工业和农业生产建设的需要。这是林业建设的总任务，也是我们全国林业职工和广大人民奋斗的总目标。
    根据这个总任务，我们1960年主要是做好下述两方面的工作，通过这两方面的工作来实现林业更好更全面的跃进。
      （一）在林业方面：以巩固、提高和发展社办林场及国营林场为中心，积极实现林业生产基地化，林业经营林场化，林木培育速生丰产化，把林业建设的群众运动推向新的阶段。
    林业生产基地化，林业经营林场化，林木培育速生丰产化，是我国林业发展的方向，同时也标志我国林业建设走上了一个新阶段。
    林业生产基地化，就是根据国民经济发展的要求和各地特点，运用人民公社的有利条件，经过规划设计，合理地安排林业生产的布局，划定地区，集中成片，有计划地造林、育林。林业经营林场化，就是在有造林营林任务的地方设立林场，设置专职人员，组织专业队伍，加强对林木的经营管理。林木培育速生丰产化，就是在造林营林的过程中，贯彻执行林木培育管理的基本技术措施，使林木加快成长，提前成材或提前结果，并提高单位面积产量。
    林业的“三化”，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的产物，在推行林业“三化”的过程中，也就必然会推动林业的继续大跃进。我们的口号是：样样林产有基地，处处基地设林场，个个林场搞丰产。我们可以预见到，随之而来的将必是：森林资源的迅速扩大，森林分布的逐步平衡，和整个林业的迅速现代化。
    （二）在森林工业方面：大力增产木材与大搞以纤维板为中心的木材综合利用同时并举，力求保证国家建设对木材与林副产品的需要。
    木材在国民经济中的作用是很重要的。随着我国社会主义建设事业的大跃进与人民生活的大改善，木材和林副产品特别是木材需要量与日俱增。因此，我们的首要任务是增产木材，千方百计争取木材生产有较大的增长。我们对此努力的途径是：一是充分发挥现有采伐企业的生产潜力；一是积极加强基本建设，开发尚未开发的森林资源。除了继续开发东北和内蒙古林区以外，还要开发四川、福建林区和陕西秦岭林区。叫沉睡了千百年的深山宝藏，赶快来为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    在大力增产木材的同时，大搞以人造板为中心的木材综合利用。这对充分利用森林资源和解决目前木材生产与供应之间的矛盾，具有非常重要的意义。因为木材不仅数量庞大，而且包含着多种物质，可以生产多种多样的产品，来满足工业生产上多方面的需要；同时旧中国遗留下来的森林资源不是太多的，而我国目前木材利用率又还不太高，全国林区采伐、加工和城市木材加工剩下的废料数量很大，如果经过物理和化学的再加工，把这些废料以至树根、树皮、树叶、树汁等统通利用起来，制成各种人造板和林化产品，用来代替原木使用或用作工业生产的原材料，那末，就等于为国家增产了大量木材，同时也有利于工业生产的全面大跃进。
    在木材的综合利用中，发展纤维板工业特别重要。因为纤维板生产是充分利用废材，提高木材利用率的主要途径。三百万立方米废材，制成纤维板，可以顶五百万立方米原木使用；使用原料又最广泛，即可以用各种木材纤维，又可以用各种草本植物纤维，无论林区或缺林区，都可以大搞纤维板。同时纤维板的用途又极宽广，如：房屋和车船装修、家具和日用品制造、以及工农业产品包装等等，共有三百多种用途，因此，大力发展纤维板工业，就成为林业战线上头等重要的任务。
    我们林业战线上的任务是光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。我们决定在党中央和毛主席的领导下，继续坚持政治挂帅，进一步大搞群众运动坚决贯彻执行总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，大搞技术革新和技术革命；并在具体措施上，加强基本建设，改进企业管理，系统的总结、提高和推广先进经验，贯彻“两参一改三结合”的制度，调动一切积极因素，把社会主义林业建设事业一浪高一浪地推向前进。目前，我国经济建设的形势好得很，有利的条件比过去任何时候多。我们有充分的信心，一定可以胜利完成国家交给我们的任务，提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”对于绿化祖国的要求，并依照毛主席指出的方向，在祖国的大地上逐步实现园林化。我们生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，真是充满着希望、光明、幸福和自豪。
    让我们大家更坚强地团结起来，和全国人民一道，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜下，努力再努力，跃进再跃进。
