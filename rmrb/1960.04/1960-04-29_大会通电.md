Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Telegram from the People of All Circles in the Capital Supporting the Patriotic and Just Struggle of the South Korean People:

    We, the 600,000 people from all walks of life in the capital, solemnly gathered in front of Tiananmen today to support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people. We express our infinite respect for the fearless anti-fascist mass movement of the South Korean people and express our utmost indignation and severe condemnation of the bloody massacres by the US-Syngman Rhee reactionary clique.
    The Syngman Rhee puppet regime, fostered by US imperialism, has been implementing the most barbaric fascist rule in South Korea for twelve years, in accordance with the will of its master, in an attempt to make South Korea a permanent colony of the United States and a forward base for aggression in Asia, and to make the South Korean people cannon fodder for US aggressive wars. However, the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee reactionary clique has increasingly aroused the anger and resistance of the South Korean people. The raging fire of struggle that has ignited in South Korea today has forced Syngman Rhee to announce his resignation. The South Korean people's just struggle has achieved initial victory. The Chinese people congratulate the heroic and just South Korean people for this. However, the heinous Syngman Rhee and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique have not yet been punished. The culprit that obstructs Korean reunification, enslaves the South Korean people, and plunges South Korea into the abyss of suffering—US imperialism—still occupies the land of South Korea, flaunting its power and continuing to interfere in Korean internal affairs, continuing to support and support the reactionary forces in South Korea, and frantically suppressing the revolutionary struggle in South Korea. We firmly believe that the heroic South Korean people will surely continue their struggle until they achieve complete and thorough victory, drive all the invading troops of US imperialism out of South Korean territory completely and cleanly, and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    The struggle of the South Korean people is by no means isolated. They are receiving the sympathy and support of the people of the world. Their patriotic and just struggle must be victorious. US imperialism and the reactionaries it supports are nothing but paper tigers. The Japanese people's struggle against the US occupation and the US-Japan military alliance treaty is developing wave after wave. The US attempt to turn Japan into a source of aggressive war in Asia is being met with increasingly fierce opposition from the Japanese people. Under the persistent and heroic struggle of the South Korean people, the Japanese people, and all the Asian people, the heinous rule of US imperialism and its lackeys in some Asian countries will surely be smashed to pieces. US imperialism get out of South Korea, get out of Japan, get out of South Vietnam, get out of the Philippines, get out of our sacred territory of Taiwan!

    大会通电
    新华社28日讯　首都各界人民支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会通电
    我们首都各界六十万人民，今天在天安门前隆重集会，支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。我们对南朝鲜人民大无畏的反法西斯的群众运动表示无限的敬意，对美李反动集团的血腥屠杀表示万分愤慨和严厉的谴责。
    美帝国主义一手扶植的李承晚傀儡政权，秉承其主子的意志，十二年来在南朝鲜一直实行着最野蛮的法西斯统治，企图使南朝鲜永远沦为美国的殖民地和在亚洲进行侵略的前哨基地，使南朝鲜人民充当美国侵略战争的炮灰。但是美李反动集团的法西斯统治，越来越激起南朝鲜人民的愤怒和反抗。今天在南朝鲜燃烧起来的势如燎原的斗争烈火，已经迫使李承晚不得不宣布下台。南朝鲜人民的正义斗争已经取得了初步的胜利。中国人民为此向英勇的正义的南朝鲜人民表示祝贺。但是罪恶滔天的李承晚和李承晚卖国集团还没有受到惩办，阻挠朝鲜统一、奴役南朝鲜人民和把南朝鲜投入苦难深渊的罪魁祸首——美帝国主义，仍然盘据在南朝鲜的土地上作威作福，继续干涉朝鲜内政，继续扶植和支持南朝鲜的反动势力，对南朝鲜的革命斗争进行疯狂的镇压。我们坚决相信，英勇的南朝鲜人民必定将再接再厉进行斗争，直到取得全面、彻底的胜利，把美帝国主义的侵略军队从南朝鲜土地上全部、干净地驱逐出去，实现祖国的和平统一事业。
    南朝鲜人民的斗争决不是孤立的，他们受到全世界人民的同情和支持，他们的爱国正义斗争一定要胜利。美帝国主义和它扶植的反动派都不过是纸老虎。日本人民反对美国的占领和日美军事同盟条约的斗争，正在一浪高过一浪地向前发展，美国企图变日本为亚洲侵略战争的策源地的阴谋，正遭到日本人民越来越激烈的反对。在南朝鲜人民、日本人民和全亚洲人民坚持不懈的、英勇不屈的斗争下，美帝国主义及其走狗在亚洲一些国家的罪恶统治，必将被打得粉碎。美帝国主义从南朝鲜滚出去，从日本滚出去，从南越滚出去，从菲律宾滚出去，从我国的神圣领土台湾滚出去！
