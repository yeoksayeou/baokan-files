Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 14th: The early completion of the summer harvest crop planting plan is a new phenomenon emerging after the completion of agricultural cooperativization in the vast majority of rural areas of the German Democratic Republic.

According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the German Democratic Republic, speaking to our reporter: as of April 10, the nationwide summer grain sowing has been completed; the planting of early-harvest potatoes and sugar beets has begun in various places, and preparations are being made for the planting of mid-season and late-season potatoes. In order to provide sufficient feed for the continuously increasing livestock, more than 10% of the country's arable land will be planted with maize this year.

This year, the natural conditions for spring sowing in the German Democratic Republic were not better than in previous years: the spring started relatively late, and the soil water shortage caused by last year's drought and winter dryness has not yet been eliminated. However, because farmers participated in cooperatives village by village and county by county, the land was connected into large areas, and collective labor began to be organized, which brought into play the superiority of large-scale collective production. The nationwide summer grain sowing plan was generally completed earlier than last year. The largest agricultural special zone in the country, the Neubrandenburg Special Zone, completed its spring sowing plan thirteen days earlier than last year. During the spring sowing period, state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, and cooperatives and cooperatives across the country launched socialist mutual support in terms of seeds, machinery, agricultural tools, transportation, etc., and many new and moving events emerged. The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said that the superiority of collective production will be further demonstrated with the continuous improvement of production organization.

During this year's spring sowing, state-owned machine tractor stations and tractors that have been allocated to agricultural production cooperatives played a good role. Many state-owned industrial, transportation, and forestry departments have transferred tractors and drivers to support spring sowing. Some units of the National People's Army also participated in spring sowing. The number of tractors dispatched across the country was 5,200 more than last year. Many tractors worked overnight, and the area of land ploughed and sown at night across the country was greatly increased compared with last year, forming an unprecedented upsurge in spring sowing.

### 合作化发挥了巨大的优越性  德国春播计划提前完成

    合作化发挥了巨大的优越性
    德国春播计划提前完成
    新华社柏林14日电　夏收作物播种计划提前完成，这是德意志民主共和国绝大部分农村地区完成农业合作化后出现的新气象。
    据德意志民主共和国农林部负责人对本社记者说：到4月10日为止，全国夏收谷物播种工作已经结束；各地已开始进行早收马铃薯和甜菜的播种，并准备进行中收和晚收马铃薯的播种。为了使不断增加的牲畜有足够的饲料，今年全国将有10％以上的耕地种植玉蜀黍。
    今年，德意志民主共和国春播的自然条件并不比往年好：春天开始得比较晚，去年干旱和冬季干燥所造成的土壤缺水情况尚未消除。但是，由于农民整乡整县地参加了合作社，土地连成大片，并开始组织起集体劳动，这就发挥出集体大生产的优越性，全国夏收谷物播种计划一般较去年完成得早。全国最大的农业专区——新勃兰登堡专区，比去年提早十三天完成了春播计划。在春播期间，全国各地国营农场和农业生产合作社之间、合作社与合作社之间在种子、机器、农具、运输力量等各方面展开了社会主义的互相支援，出现了许多新的动人事例。农林部负责人说，集体生产的优越性还将随着生产组织的不断改善而进一步显示出来。
    今年春播期间，国营机器拖拉机站和已经拨给农业生产合作社管理的拖拉机发挥了良好的作用。许多国营工业、交通和林业部门，都调拨了拖拉机和司机支援春播。一部分国家人民军也参加了春播工作。全国出动的拖拉机较去年多五千二百台。许多拖拉机彻夜工作，全国在夜间翻耕播种的土地面积较去年大为提高，形成了过去从未有过的春播高潮。
