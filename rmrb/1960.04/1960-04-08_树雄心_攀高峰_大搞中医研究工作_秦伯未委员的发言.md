I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, and fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960.

    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, under the guidance of the brilliant and outstanding Mao Zedong Thought and the three victorious red flags, China's industrial and agricultural production is continuing to leap forward at high speed, the upsurge of the cultural and technological revolution is surging, and health work is rapidly accelerating to closely cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, achieving tremendous success. This excellent situation encourages every practitioner of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine to be determined, under the leadership of the Party, to follow the instructions of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, further implement the Party's general line and various policies, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in health work. We, as practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, are determined to continue strengthening the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in order to rapidly develop the work of inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, further vigorously engage in scientific research in traditional Chinese medicine, and push the research and organization of traditional Chinese medicine to a climax wave after wave.

    Our Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a young college with few people and poor conditions, but great ambitions. In 1958, the scientific research projects began with 69 items. In 1959, in addition to the 28 unfinished items from the previous year, 53 new projects were added, totaling 81 items. By the end of 1959, 103 items had actually been completed. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, teachers, students, and staff of the entire college once again ushered in a high tide of leap forward, and the scientific research projects increased to 295 items. Not only did the quantity leap forward significantly, but the quality also improved repeatedly. At the same time, certain achievements were also made in further applying modern scientific methods and modern medicine to conduct research in traditional Chinese medicine.

    The victory of scientific research in traditional Chinese medicine is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine. According to the experience of the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the key lies in the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, resolutely implementing the Party's policies, fully mobilizing the masses, breaking down superstitions, liberating thinking, combining youth and old age, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and giving full play to collective wisdom and potential. This is the decisive factor in achieving results. Facts tell us that our college has been established for less than four years. Under the objective conditions of insufficient human and material resources, we must complete teaching tasks and medical tasks, and also vigorously engage in scientific research. However, we rely closely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, resolutely listen to the Party, adopt the cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combine experts and the masses, and vigorously launch mass movements. At the same time, we realize that vigorously engaging in scientific research is closely related to improving the quality of education and medical care. In our scientific research work, we have implemented the Party's instructions: breaking down superstitions and liberating thinking are necessary to achieve excellent results in our work.

    Now, I would like to share my personal experiences on some specific issues in the scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine.

    First of all, traditional Chinese medicine is rich and colorful, containing a wealth of experience and theoretical knowledge, which is a "great treasure house." However, due to the limitations of past historical conditions, there are inevitably some shortcomings in the observation and analysis of diseases. To raise it to the level of modern science, it needs to be supplemented and revised with modern scientific knowledge and methods. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine has its unique theoretical system, which contains a large number of scientific essences. These essences must be absorbed to enrich our modern medical science knowledge and make more creative contributions to modern medicine. From this, it can be seen that strengthening the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine is the key issue in the scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine. Now, the unity between traditional Chinese and Western medicine has been greatly strengthened, and the national nihilistic tendency of underestimating and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine has been fundamentally reversed. In the future, to vigorously carry out the scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine, we must also overcome the conservative thinking of some practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine who believe that traditional Chinese medicine is perfect and infallible, sticking to old ways and blindly believing in the ancients. In order to correctly implement the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine, we must correct our thinking, deeply understand the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policies on Traditional Chinese Medicine," proceed from the viewpoint of historical materialism, and adopt a realistic attitude. It must be conducive to the development of national heritage and also conducive to the development of modern medicine. Following the direction indicated to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong, we must treat traditional Chinese medicine with organization, improvement, and integration with modern science to create China's original medical school.

    The current scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine covers a wide range, but organization and improvement are important tasks among them.

    The current scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine covers a wide range, but organization and improvement are important tasks among them. For example, the literature of traditional Chinese medicine is vast and each has its own strengths, but in today's training of new forces, a complete set of new textbooks is needed, which are to be compiled by the five colleges of traditional Chinese medicine in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Nanjing. Recently, I participated in the review meeting of this batch of traditional Chinese medicine textbooks, and I feel that in terms of the development process, they are written with new viewpoints and new languages, which is unprecedented. The preliminary work of organization and improvement has been done, laying the foundation for more scientific and complete textbooks in the future, and creating favorable conditions for the development of teaching, medical treatment, and research in the future. For example, research and medical treatment are closely related, and scientific research is an important measure to improve the quality of medical care. Similarly, everything is for the patient. Therefore, clinical effects must be summarized at any time to improve them and gather scattered experiences together to form a complete set. Therefore, the popularization and application, persistence, and pursuit of victory will become an effective set of treatment rules for traditional Chinese medicine, and can continuously provide new topics for scientific research. In addition, inheriting and summarizing the experience of veteran practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, collecting secret prescriptions and effective prescriptions for organization is also one of the important tasks at present.

    Research in traditional Chinese medicine must attach importance to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has always used theory to guide practice. Without the original theoretical basis, it is impossible to treat diseases, let alone research in traditional Chinese medicine. This year, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine called on us to conduct research on "syndrome differentiation and treatment" in clinical practice, which I think is very appropriate. Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the law of traditional Chinese medicine for treating diseases. It contains all the theoretical, legal, prescription, and medicinal knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, such as the three causes, four diagnoses, eight principles, and eight methods. That is to say, every aspect of the prescription for traditional Chinese medicine is permeated with the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Only by using syndrome differentiation and treatment can we truly integrate theory with practice, think independently, break through frameworks, and carry forward the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine. Some people mistakenly believe that syndrome differentiation and treatment is to use medicine for whatever symptoms are seen, which not only vulgarizes this law, but also fundamentally violates the spirit of traditional Chinese medicine treatment. Of course, this is not to say that all the theories of traditional Chinese medicine are truths, but those that are effective in clinical practice should not be easily abandoned, but should be researched and improved.

    Scientific research itself is a synthesis, so extensive collaboration is necessary to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    In the research work of traditional Chinese medicine, we must also pay attention to the fact that scientific research itself is a synthesis. Leaving collaboration will lead to separation from the masses and reality, which will inevitably lead to less, slower, poorer, and more expensive results. The scientific research work of the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine mainly focuses on collaboration, large-scale collaboration outside the college, and small-scale collaboration inside the college. For example, the research on the mechanism and essence of meridians and acupuncture points is jointly collaborated by the acupuncture, biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, and tissue teaching and research groups. Under the same research project, research is conducted that is both collaborative and differentiated according to the nature of their own business. For example, medicine and pharmacy are inseparable. When traditional Chinese medicine has achieved curative effects in treating some diseases that modern medicine has not yet solved, the research of Chinese medicine will closely follow up. A Chinese medicine research collaboration group has been organized, which is made up of teaching and research groups such as Chinese medicine, chemistry, pharmacology, biology, prescription, and internal medicine, as well as pharmaceutical factories, pharmacies, and the potential of students in Chinese medicine research classes is explored to join the collaboration. On the one hand, research is carried out from the aspects of pharmacology, phytochemistry, processing, identification, and preparation. On the other hand, it is used in clinical practice to better combine production. In this way, scientific research, teaching, and medical treatment are combined, and under the leadership of the Party, the combination of youth and old age, and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine become a five-way combination. Due to large-scale collaboration, everyone is able to use their talents, and materials are used to their fullest extent. Adaptations are made in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and the Party's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results is implemented.

    Strengthening the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine is the key issue in the scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine.

    Finally, it is pointed out that the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is one of the four major policies in the field of health. In today's vigorous research in traditional Chinese medicine, it is even more necessary to strengthen the close integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, especially that traditional Chinese medicine must humbly learn from Western medicine. From my own experience, sincere cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine and correct treatment of some issues in the research of traditional Chinese medicine can greatly improve work efficiency and enrich harvests. For example, in the research work of the affiliated hospital of the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in the treatment of "tabes dorsalis," although only dozens of cases were treated, the Western doctors made a correct analysis through the observation of actual clinical effects. They affirmed that the improvement of the symptoms of these patients was due to the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine, not due to the curative effect of penicillin injected within two years by most patients. Their analysis is: 1. All cases taking traditional Chinese medicine have rapid effects, which is not common in penicillin treatment; 2. Two cases without traditional Chinese medicine, although penicillin was used within two years, showed no progress; 3. One case had never used penicillin before using traditional Chinese medicine, and penicillin was not used this time, and the same significant clinical progress was obtained; 4. Although four cases had some clinical progress in penicillin treatment, they had not improved for a long time before traditional Chinese medicine treatment, and significant improvement was seen again after using traditional Chinese medicine, etc. It can be seen that Western doctors repeatedly compared to further affirm the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine, how much importance is attached to the research of traditional Chinese medicine! In this process of sincere cooperation, I have added a lot of new knowledge, and encouraged my spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. Furthermore, I collaborated with Xiehe Hospital to treat patients with myelitis and paraplegia caused by other or unknown causes, and obtained preliminary results. On this basis, I also have the ambition to further study the theories and mechanisms of action of all diseases related to spinal cord nerves. Therefore, I deeply realize that strengthening the unity and close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine is the key to better serving the people and the key to doing a good job in the research and organization of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

    In summary, I believe that to vigorously conduct research in traditional Chinese medicine, we must adhere to putting politics in command, closely connect with the masses, combine with the current central tasks, continue to break down superstitions, liberate thinking, and have the spirit of continuous revolution in the communist spirit under the leadership of the Party. In specific work, we must attach importance to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, summarize the curative effects, seize the clues, promote them in time, vigorously collaborate, and vigorously innovate, to make greater contributions to the creation of China's original new medical school.

    We firmly believe that with the strong leadership of the Party and the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, under the excellent situation of the nationwide leap forward, we will definitely complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party, and are willing to work together with comrades of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

    树雄心　攀高峰　大搞中医研究工作
    秦伯未委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协常务委员会的工作报告，完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    北京中医学院的科学研究工作，不仅研究项目有了增加，质量也一再提高
    在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，在英明杰出的毛泽东思想和三面胜利红旗的指引下，我国工农业生产正在高速度地持续跃进，文化和技术革命的高潮汹涌澎湃，卫生工作正在快马加鞭地紧紧配合着工农业生产的大跃进取得了巨大成就。这种大好形势，鼓舞着每一个中西医药工作者，决心在党的领导下，遵循着共产党和毛泽东主席的指示，进一步贯彻执行党的总路线和各项方针政策，为取得卫生工作的更大跃进而奋勇前进。我们中医工作者，为了继承与发扬祖国医学遗产的工作迅速地开展，决心继续加强中西医的团结合作，进一步大搞中医科学研究，把祖国医学的研究和整理工作，一浪高一浪地推向高潮。
    我们北京中医学院是一个年青的学院，人少、条件差，但是志气大。1958年开始进行科学研究的项目就有六十九项，1959年除了上年尚未完成的二十八项继续研究外，又增加了五十三项新项目，共计八十一项，到1959年底实际上完成了一百零三项。而在党的八届八中全会之后，全院师生员工在反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召下，再一次出现了跃进高潮，科学研究的项目又增加到二百九十五项。不但数量上大大跃进了一步，在质量上也一再提高，同时，进一步应用现代科学方法和现代医学进行中医研究工作，也取得了一定的成绩。
    中医研究工作的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的中医政策的胜利
    中医研究工作的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的中医政策的胜利。根据北京中医学院的经验，主要关键在于党的领导，政治挂帅，坚决贯彻党的方针政策；充分发动群众，破除迷信，解放思想，青年和老年结合，中西医结合，发挥集体的智慧和潜力，这是取得成果的决定性因素。事实告诉我们：我院建院不满四年，在人力物力不足的客观条件下，既要完成教学任务、医疗任务，又要大搞科学研究。但是，我们紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚决听党的话，采取中西医合作，专家和群众相结合，大搞群众运动；同时我们认识到，大搞科学研究对提高教育质量、医疗质量，有着密切关系，我们在科学研究工作中贯彻了党所指示的：破除迷信，解放思想，才能在工作中取得优越的成绩。
    现在，就中医研究工作中的一些具体问题，谈谈我个人的体会。
    首先，祖国医学是丰富多彩的，它蕴藏着丰富的经验和理论知识，是一个“伟大的宝库”。但受过去历史条件的限制，在对疾病的观察和分析上不可避免有些缺点，把它提高到现代科学水平，就需要用现代科学的知识和方法加以补充修正。另一方面，祖国医学有其独特的理论体系，其中具有大量的科学性的精华，必须把这些精华吸收起来，使我国现代的医学科学知识更加丰富，对现代医学作出更多的创造性的贡献。由此可见，加强中西医的团结合作，是中医研究工作的关键问题。现在中西医团结大为加强，轻视歧视中医的民族虚无主义的倾向得到根本扭转，今后大力开展中医科学研究工作，还要克服部分中医思想上认为中医学术是完美无缺的、固步自封迷信古人的保守思想。为了正确贯彻执行党的中医政策，必须端正思想，深入体会人民日报社论“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的精神，从历史唯物观点出发，采取实事求是的态度。既要有利于民族遗产的发扬，又要有利于现代医学的发展。遵循着党中央和毛泽东主席所指示我们的方向，对待中医要整理提高与现代科学相结合，创造我国独创性的医药学派。
    当前中医的科学研究，包含的面相当广，但整理提高是其中的重要任务
    当前中医的科学研究，包含的面相当广，整理提高是其中的重要任务。比如：中医文献浩如烟海，各有特长，但在今天培养新生力量的时候，需要成套的新教材，即由北京、上海、广州、成都、南京五个中医学院分任编写。最近我参加了这批中医教材的审查会议，感觉到在发展过程方面，是以新的观点与新的语言来写的，是以前所没有的。做到了整理提高的初步工作，为今后科学性更高的更完备的教材打下了基础，并对今后教学、医疗、研究的发展创造了有利的条件。又如：研究和医疗是有密切联系的，科学研究是提高医疗质量的重要措施，同样一切为了病人。所以在临床上收到疗效，必须随时总结，使之提高，把分散的经验汇集起来，使之配搭成套。从而推广应用，坚持下去，乘胜追击，就成为中医的一套有效的治疗规律，并可不断提供科学研究的新课题。此外，如继承总结老中医的经验，搜集秘方验方加以整理，也是当前重要任务之一。
    中医研究必须重视中医理论，中医向来运用理论来指导实践，离开了原有理论基础无法治病，更谈不上中医研究。今年中医研究院号召我们在临床上进行“辨症论治”的研究，我认为是十分惬当的。辨症论治是中医治病的法则，它包涵着中医的三因、四诊、八纲、八法等理、法、方、药全部知识。也就是说中医治病处方，每一方面贯穿着中医的理论，只有运用辨症论治才能真正理论联系实践，独立思考，冲破框框，发扬祖国医学的特点。有些人误认辨症论治为见什么症用什么药，那不仅把这法则庸俗化了，而且根本违背了中医治病的精神。当然，这不是说中医理论都是真理，但在临床上用之有效的，不容许轻易放弃，还要把它研究提高。
    科学研究本身是个综合体，因此必须广泛协作，才能多快好省
    在中医研究工作中，还必须注意到科学研究本身是个综合体，离开协作就会脱离群众，脱离实际，势必少慢差费。北京中医学院的科研工作主要是抓协作，对院外搞大协作，对院内搞小协作。例如经络针灸的机制和本质的研究，是由针灸、生化、生理、解剖、组织等教研组共同协作，在同一研究项目下，根据本身业务性质进行既协作又分工的研究。又如医与药是不可分割的，临床上中医治疗了一些目前现代医学尚未解决的疾病已经取得疗效时，中药的研究就紧跟上去，组织了中药研究协作组，由中药、化学、药理、生物、方剂、内科等教研组及药厂、药房协作起来，并发掘中药研究班同学的潜力加入协作，一方面分别从药理、药化、炮制、鉴别、制剂等进行研究，一方面使用于临床，更好地结合生产。这样，科研、教学、医疗三者都结合起来了，同时在党的领导下又做到青年与老年结合、中西医结合，成为五结合。由于大搞协作，做到了人尽其才，物尽其用，在人力、物力、财力上就进行适应的调节，贯彻了党的多、快、好、省的方针。
    加强中西医的团结合作，是中医研究工作的关键问题
    最后指出，中西医团结是卫生事业中四大方针之一，在大搞中医研究的今天，更要加强中西医的密切结合，尤其是中医须向西医虚心学习。从我亲身所体验的来说，中西医真诚合作，正确地对待中医研究中的一些问题，可使工作效率大大提高，收获愈加丰富。如我参加北京中医学院附属医院和中国医学科学院皮肤性病研究所合作治疗“脊髓痨”的研究工作中，尽管只治疗了几十病例，而西医们通过实际临床效果的观察作出了正确的分析，他们肯定这些病人症候的好转，是中医中药的疗效，不是由于大部分病人曾经在两年内注射过青霉素的疗效。他们的分析是：一、所有服中药的病例都有很快的疗效，这在青霉素治疗上是不常见的；二、不用中药的二例，虽然也在二年内用过青霉素，不显进步；三、一例用中药以前从未用过青霉素，这次也未合用青霉素，同样获得明显的临床进步；四、有四例虽然在青霉素治疗中曾有些临床进步，但在中药治疗前已有很长一段时期不再更好转，这次用中药后又见明显好转等。可以看出，西医们反复对照来进一步肯定中医疗效，对于中医研究何等重视！在这真诚合作的过程中，增添了我不少新的知识，并鼓励了我敢想敢说敢干的精神，进一步又和协和医院协作，治疗了其它原因或原因不明的脊髓炎截瘫患者，得到了初步效果。在这基础上，并使我还有雄心进一步研究治疗一切有关脊髓神经疾病的理论和作用机制。因此，我深深体会到加强中西医团结亲密合作，是更好地为人民服务的关键，也是做好祖国医学遗产研究整理工作的关键。
    综上所述，我认为大搞中医研究工作，必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，密切联系群众，结合当前中心任务，继续破除迷信，解放思想，有不断革命的共产主义精神。在具体工作中，要重视中医理论，总结疗效，抓住苗头，及时推广，大搞协作，大闹革新，为创造出我国独创的新医药学派作出更大的贡献。
    我们深信，有坚强的党的领导，有伟大的毛泽东思想为指导，在全国全民大跃进的大好形势下，我们一定能完成党交给我们的光荣任务，愿与中西医同志们共同奋斗。
