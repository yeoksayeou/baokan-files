    The Capitalized "Person"
    Liu Di
    More than forty years ago, Gorky, with a voice unfamiliar to many at the time, said firmly and confidently: "How proud sounds the word 'Man'!" "Man, lift your head from the murky mire of the petty bourgeoisie, and recognize your immortal creative will!" Gorky wanted people to become capitalized "Persons."
    What is a capitalized "Person"? When I first read Gorky's words, I only knew that writing a person's name in capital letters in Russian was a sign of respect and love, just as we use large font sizes to write that person's name. Later, I further understood that the capitalized "Person" Gorky spoke of was precisely the towering heroic image of the proletarian revolutionary, the immortal heroic image of hundreds of millions of working people. Today, the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people is undergoing tremendous changes, and the communist ideology and style are sweeping the country. Thus, this kind of person worthy of capitalization stands proudly before us, everywhere, simply countless. Recently, the people's communes in many cities, with production as the center, have comprehensively organized the people's economic life, thoroughly liberated women's labor power, and greatly changed the spiritual outlook of urban residents, especially housewives. Thus, we see that housewives, who for thousands of years revolved around the kitchen stove, have jumped out of their narrow world and thrown themselves into the great ranks of socialist construction. They are also the capitalized "Persons" Gorky spoke of.
    For housewives to become capitalized "Persons" is a historic change. In the past, people often associated the term "housewife" with backward concepts such as ignorance, conservatism, selfishness, narrow-mindedness, and short-sightedness. But today's era is different. With the new situation of the high-speed development of socialist construction, housewives are also appearing before us with a completely new fighting posture and spiritual outlook, and people cannot help but re-evaluate them with new eyes. They are not ignorant, but intelligent and capable; not conservative and selfish, but selfless; not narrow-minded and short-sighted, but broad-minded and far-sighted, with revolutionary ambitions and a noble communist style. They have not only "lifted their heads from the murky mire of the petty bourgeoisie, and recognized their immortal creative will," but are also engaged in creative labor for socialist construction. They, like the millions of working people, are not lowercase people, but capitalized people, brand new people in our new era.
    Look at these capitalized people:
    Huang Lihua, a resident of the Third Lane Committee of Mengzi Road in Shanghai, always felt dull and inferior when she was trapped in the small circle of her family; but once she was organized to participate in production activities, her mood improved, her horizons broadened, and she became more and more concerned about collective affairs, and her previously bound wisdom and talents were fully liberated. Recently, Huang Lihua was the first to respond to the Party's call in the lane's hardware production workshop, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and creating a tool to replace manual sorting of buttons, increasing work efficiency eight times, and also successfully testing an electric punch press. Neighbors praised her, saying: "Huang Lihua has become smarter." "Who would have thought that she has become so capable in the past two years."
    The Sixth Residents' Committee of Dashizi Street in Dadong District, Shenyang City, with Sun Jinglan as the leader, a dozen housewives discussed together and said: "The whole country is in the Great Leap Forward, can we sit at home and wait for others to build socialism?" Their conclusion was: No, we must add bricks and tiles to socialist construction. So they tried every means, relied on their own efforts, and started from scratch. In less than half a year, they set up a refractory material factory, a small hardware factory, and a foundry, with more than 340 housewives participating in production. They made their own tools when they didn't have them, and worked hard to learn technology when they didn't have it, demonstrating the industrious, brave, and creative spirit of the working people. In one year, the refractory material factory expanded from two factory buildings to forty-eight, from one machine to twenty, from only being able to produce refractory bricks to being able to produce more than seventy kinds of products, and from a monthly output value of 200 yuan to 50,000 yuan. What a tremendous force, what an amazing creation!
    These moving examples are emerging endlessly in various places. As for the collectivist spirit and communist style of housewives who serve as service personnel in the large-scale urban collective welfare undertakings, who care for the masses, care for the collective, sacrifice themselves for others, and enthusiastically do things for everyone, it is even more dazzling.
    The tremendous change in the spiritual outlook of urban housewives is not an accidental event. It is closely related to these fresh things such as the large-scale development of street industries, public welfare undertakings, and public canteens in cities across the country, and the comprehensive organization of the people's economic life. As soon as these new things appeared, the face of urban housewives was renewed. Seventy-six years ago, Engels pointed out: "As long as women are excluded from socially productive labor and are restricted to private labor at home, the emancipation of women, equality between women and men, is impossible. The emancipation of women becomes possible only when women can take part in production on a large, social scale, and domestic work occupies only an insignificant amount of their time." Precisely because the comprehensive organization of the economic life of urban people, the collectivization of the life of urban residents, and the socialization of housework have liberated thousands of housewives from the tedious and ignorant housework and directly participated in socialist construction, they have achieved true liberation. Their position in the family has changed, their position in society has changed, and their relationship with the collective and the country has also changed. More importantly, their ideological outlook has changed. They have linked their destiny with the great socialist and communist revolutionary cause, they have seen their own strength, eliminated superstitious and conservative old ideas, broadened their minds, broadened their horizons, and promoted the communist spirit. They have truly become capitalized people, becoming what Chairman Mao said, "a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person free from base interests, and a person beneficial to the people."
    Material and spirit have a mutually promoting effect. Existence determines consciousness, and conversely, people's consciousness under certain conditions promotes the development of social production. Our era has produced thousands upon thousands of capitalized people, and these capitalized people will surely use capitalized words to write a great poem for our era!

    大写的“人”
    柳笛
    四十多年以前，高尔基曾经用当时许多人所不熟悉的声音，坚强而自信地说过：“人，这个字听起来多么骄傲！”“人，从混浊的小市民的泥淖中抬起头来，认清自己的永生不灭的创造意志吧！”高尔基要人们去做大写的“人”。
    什么是大写的“人”？开始读高尔基的话，只知道，在俄文中用大写的字母写出人的名字，是尊重和敬爱的意思，就像我们用头号字来写这个人的名字一样。后来进一步了解，高尔基所说的大写的“人”，正是无产阶级革命者的高大的英雄形象，是亿万劳动人民的不朽的英雄形象。今天，我国人民的精神面貌发生着巨大的变化，共产主义的思想风格风靡全国，于是，这种值得大写的人在我们面前昂然屹立，到处可见，简直不可以数计。最近，许多城市的人民公社以生产为中心，全面组织人民经济生活，彻底地解放了妇女劳动力，大大地改变了城市居民，特别是家庭妇女的精神面貌。于是，我们看到，几千年来围着锅台转的家庭妇女，跳出了狭小天地，投身到社会主义建设的伟大行列中来了。她们也正是高尔基所说的大写的“人”。
    家庭妇女成为大写的人，这是一件历史性的变化。过去，人们常常把“家庭妇女”这个名词同愚昧无知、保守自私、心胸狭隘，目光短浅等等落后的概念联系在一起。可是今天的时代不同了，随着社会主义建设事业高速度发展的新形势，家庭妇女也以全新的战斗姿态和精神面貌出现在我们面前，人们不能不对她们重新认识、刮目相看。她们并不是愚昧无知，而是聪明能干；并不是保守自私，而是大公无私；并不是心胸狭隘、目光短浅，而是心胸开阔、目光远大，具有革命的雄心大志和高尚的共产主义风格。她们不仅已经“从混浊的小市民的泥淖中抬起头来，认清自己的永生不灭的创造意志”，而且为社会主义建设进行着创造性的劳动。她们和千千万万的劳动人民一样，不是小写的人，是大写的人，是我们新时代里全新的人。
    看看下面这些大写的人吧：
    上海蒙自路第三里弄委员会的居民黄丽华，当她还被困郁在家庭的小圈子里的时候，她总感到自己迟钝和自卑；但是一经组织起来参加了生产活动，她的心情舒畅了，眼光开阔了，对集体的事情越来越关心了，过去被束缚着的智慧才能充分解放出来。最近，黄丽华在里弄五金生产工场中第一个响应党的号召，大搞技术革新，创造了代替人工分拣钮扣的工具，提高工作效率八倍，还试验成功了一部电动冲床。邻居们都称赞她说：“黄丽华变得聪明了。”“谁想到，这两年来她变得这么能干了。”
    沈阳市大东区大什字街第六居民委员会，以孙景兰为首的十几名家庭妇女在一起讨论说：“全国都在大跃进，咱们能坐在家里等别人建成社会主义吗？”她们的结论是：不能等，要为社会主义建设添砖盖瓦。于是她们千方百计，自力更生，白手起家，不到半年的光景办起了耐火器材厂、小五金厂和铸造厂，参加生产的家庭妇女有三百四十多人。她们没有工具就自己做，没有技术就下苦功夫学，表现了劳动人民勤劳勇敢的创造精神。一年时间，那个耐火器材厂从两间厂房扩大到四十八间，从一台机器发展到二十台，从过去仅能生产耐火砖发展到能生产七十多种产品，从月产值二百元发展到五万元。这是多么巨大的力量，多么惊人的创造！
    这些动人的事例，在各地层出不穷。至于在大办城市集体福利事业中，充当服务员的家庭妇女那种关心群众、关心集体、舍己为人、热心为大家办事的集体主义精神和共产主义风格，更是光耀夺目。
    城市家庭妇女的精神面貌发生了如此巨大的变化，不是一件偶然的事。这和全国各城市大办街道工业、大办公共福利事业、大办公共食堂，全面组织人民经济生活等这些新鲜事物，有着密切的关系。这些新鲜事物一出现，城市家庭妇女的面貌随着焕然一新。七十六年以前，恩格斯曾经指出过：“只要妇女被摒弃在社会的生产劳动以外而只限于家中私人劳动，那么妇女的解放，妇女跟男子的平等，便是不可能的。妇女的解放，只有在妇女可以大量地、社会规模地参加生产，而家庭工作仅占有她们很少工夫的时候，才有可能。”正因为全面组织城市人民经济生活，城市居民的生活集体化、家务劳动社会化，使得成千成万的家庭妇女从繁琐的使人愚昧的家务劳动中解放出来，直接参加了社会主义建设，因而才得到了真正的解放。她们在家庭里的地位变了，在社会上的地位变了，同集体、同国家的关系也变了。更重要的，是思想面貌变了。她们把自己的命运和伟大的社会主义、共产主义革命事业联系在一起，她们看到了自己的力量，清除了迷信保守的旧观念，心胸开阔起来，目光远大起来，共产主义的精神发扬起来，她们真正成了大写的人，成了像毛主席所说的是“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    物质和精神有着相互促进的作用。存在决定意识，反过来，人们的意识在一定条件下又推动社会生产的发展。我们这个时代产生了千千万万大写的人，这些大写的人也一定会用大写的字为我们这个时代写出巨大的诗篇！
