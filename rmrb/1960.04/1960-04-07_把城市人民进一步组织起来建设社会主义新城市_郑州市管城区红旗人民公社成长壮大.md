Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 6th: The Hongqi People's Commune in Zhengzhou's Guancheng District, one of the earliest urban people's communes established in Henan Province, has grown and strengthened since its establishment in August 1958. Under the correct leadership of the Party, it has implemented the policy of "taking production as the center, grasping both production and life," vigorously developing production and comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. Now, in this once impoverished shantytown before liberation, more than forty factories and fifty-odd canteens have been established, along with many collective welfare, service, and cultural undertakings, presenting a vigorous new scene.

The Hongqi People's Commune was established on August 15, 1958. Located in the old city of Zhengzhou, the commune's residents are mostly citizens and the families of workers, who have historically been relatively poor. After liberation, the government had to allocate more than 50,000 yuan annually to provide relief to the residents, of whom 180 households, comprising more than 540 people, depended on government relief year-round. After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist movement in 1957, the ideological consciousness of the broad masses was unprecedentedly raised, and they urgently demanded to be organized to participate in socialist construction. In 1958, the Party organization, in accordance with the demands of the masses, actively led the masses here to launch a mass campaign of "factories in every street and lane, no idle person in every household." In order to solve the contradiction that a large number of housewives had no time to engage in housework after participating in production, the first public canteen and nursery, run by twenty-one households, emerged. They pushed down the boundary walls of three courtyards and formed a "socialist courtyard." In the high tide of the people's commune movement in the summer of 1958, the Hongqi People's Commune emerged in response to the urgent demands of the broad masses.

The Hongqi People's Commune is organized mainly by urban street residents, with six sub-communes and 18,729 members. Currently, among the street commune members, 2,421 are engaged in commune industrial production, 875 are engaged in agricultural production, 648 are engaged in various welfare, commercial, and service undertakings, and 430 are supporting state-owned factories. Among them, 3,403 people (including 2,648 women) have joined production and work since the establishment of the commune, accounting for 97% of the commune's idle labor force. The commune has established 47 factories and one agricultural brigade, as well as seven primary schools with more than 3,550 students. The commune has also established a militia division.

In the year since its establishment, the Hongqi People's Commune has demonstrated incomparable superiority and strong vitality in all its undertakings.

The factories run by the commune include chemical plants, motor manufacturing plants, monosodium glutamate factories, printing and binding plants, mimeograph stencil factories, sewing factories, and shoe factories. After these commune-run factories were established, they exerted tremendous power in just over a year. In July 1958, before the establishment of the commune, the total output value of local industries was only 700 yuan, with only seven types of products. From the establishment of the commune in August to December, the total industrial output value of the commune reached 190,000 yuan, with 23 types of products. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the commune increased sharply to more than 6.55 million yuan, with 242 types of products. In February of this year, the output value increased even more sharply to 3.56 million yuan, an increase of more than 5,080 times compared with the output value of 700 yuan in July 1958 before the establishment of the commune. The masses happily said, "A thousand years, ten thousand years, are not as good as one year of the commune." Commune-run industry has played a positive role in national industrial construction, the development of agricultural production, and the improvement of people's lives. In the past year, the 47 factories in the commune have produced a large number of industrial products such as three acids, two alkalis, saltpeter, coke, welding rods, yarn-wrapped wire, and refractory materials. In terms of supporting agricultural production, they repaired more than 500 various power machines and produced more than 200 tons of castor cake. Due to the expansion of commune-run industry and direct service to state-owned factories, it naturally became a satellite factory of state-owned factories. For example, the commune-run printing and binding plant now prints 400,000 copies of various forms, binds more than 270,000 envelopes and files, and supplies more than 145,000 cartons for local state-owned factories every month, becoming a powerful assistant to state-owned factories. Last autumn, the Xijiao Commune in Zhengzhou urgently needed to convert a 28-kilowatt motor into a generator. The large repair shop had no time to convert it, but the motor factory run by the commune converted it successfully overnight. The sewing factory and shoe factory run by the commune have produced a large number of garments and cloth shoes in the past year, which have been continuously supplied to the market. State-owned factories that have established ties with the commune also actively help the commune develop industry. In the past year, state-owned factories have trained more than 470 technicians for the Hongqi People's Commune and have also supplied a large number of waste materials, solving the problem of insufficient raw materials for commune-run industry.

While vigorously developing industrial production, the commune's agricultural production has also achieved great results. The proportion of agriculture in the commune is not large, with only 1,592 mu of cultivated land. However, in order to promote agricultural production, after the establishment of the commune, 89 large power machinery and irrigation machinery were added, accelerating the transformation of agricultural technology. In 1959, the total output of wheat in the commune increased by more than 78% compared with 1958. Autumn crops increased by 10% despite a hundred-day drought, and vegetable production also increased by 103%, achieving the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule.

While developing production, the commune also established collective living welfare undertakings centered on public canteens. A total of 58 commune-run canteens have been established in the commune. More than 95% of the commune's population eats in the canteens. Since its establishment, the canteen has always considered the convenience of the masses and tried its best to meet the different needs of various people. The masses praised it, saying: "The people's commune is like a family, life is good, and there is great enthusiasm for production." The commune has also established 15 nurseries with 1,775 children. The commune also runs a home for the elderly. According to the production and living needs of the commune members, the commune has also established a service station, six service stations, and 171 service points. The business of these service industries includes clothing dismantling, washing, sewing, repairing, renovation, temporary childcare, caring for sick patients and women in childbirth, and handling weddings and funerals. In addition, regional comprehensive stores have been established to greatly facilitate the masses. The collectivization of life not only liberates women from tedious housework, but also saves a lot of materials for the country. The fuel coal for cooking alone can save more than 2,000 tons per year.

With the development of production, the lives of the commune members have also been improved accordingly. In the past, most residents in this area had only one or two family members participating in work with a fixed income. After the establishment of the commune, a large number of consumers became laborers, and they have a certain salary every month. 97% of the commune members have increased their income. Of the more than 50,000 yuan in relief funds spent by the state each year in the past, more than 45,000 yuan can now be saved. The lives of the commune members have been significantly improved. In the early days of the commune's establishment, the average salary of the commune members was 9.84 yuan. In June 1959, it rose to 17 yuan. Now, in addition to subsidies, the average monthly salary has reached 22 yuan. Ma Daijian's family of three had only one daughter working before the establishment of the commune, with a monthly income of 18 yuan, and relied on government relief year-round. After the establishment of the commune, Ma Daijian and her mother-in-law also participated in production. The family's total monthly income is more than 70 yuan, more than three times higher than in the past. Ma Danian, a sixty-year-old woman from East Fayuan Street, received a salary after participating in production and bought a new set of clothes for her grandson. She proudly said, "Grandma has been begging for money all her life, but now she has her own money. Grandma thanks the Communist Party, thanks Chairman Mao, and thanks the good commune!"

While organizing the economic life of the commune members, the commune also organized the cultural life of the masses, establishing cultural palaces, reading rooms, libraries, film projection teams, and broadcasting stations. The cultural and recreational life of the masses is unprecedentedly active. After the establishment of the commune, commune members have written more than 30,000 poems and more than 50 scripts, and illiteracy has been basically eliminated.

With the consolidation and development of the commune, the appearance of the old urban streets is also gradually changing. After the establishment of the commune, more than 3,700 newly built and repaired houses, 15 renovated streets, and 350 newly built and improved toilets have been built, and 300,000 trees have been planted. Currently, factory buildings, commune member residences, collective living welfare and commercial service facilities, and schools are being constructed.

After the establishment of the people's commune, people's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. The phenomenon of each family being independent, not caring for each other, and often arguing over trivial matters is gone forever. Now, the commune is full of a new atmosphere of harmony, unity, mutual respect, and mutual assistance. Before the establishment of the commune, among the 85 households in Qingzhensi Street, 28 households had family discord and neighborhood disharmony. The street office had to mediate more than ten civil disputes every day. Now, every household is happy. Hu Yufeng and her mother-in-law used to argue frequently. After the establishment of the commune, Hu Yufeng participated in production, her awareness improved, and her life also improved. Both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have become good examples of respecting the mother-in-law and loving the daughter-in-law. Ma Shijiang and Ba Shireen lived next door to each other and had not spoken for seven years. Now they work and live together, resolving the old knot of many years. The masses sang in praise: "The people's commune is a flower, a flower that blooms and fragrances thousands of homes, a thousand-year-old knot is resolved in one morning, united production laughs happily." Because the masses' awareness has been raised, and they have carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, they have quickly launched a high tide of large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution. In the past year, 637 advanced figures have emerged, and more than 1,300 technological innovations have been realized. Many housewives who used to revolve around the stove have become advanced figures on various production fronts. The female commune members of the mimeograph stencil factory have produced technically complex mimeograph stencils and correction fluid. The factory could not buy oleic acid needed to produce mimeograph stencils, so they worked hard, sought teachers and consulted everywhere. As a result, they successfully trial-produced it with local methods for only 50 yuan.

The members of the Hongqi People's Commune have set up greater ambitions this year. Currently, the entire commune is in full swing in production. The total industrial output value of the entire commune this year is planned to reach 35 million yuan, an increase of 4.4 times compared with last year. In addition, according to the characteristics of urban needs, it will vigorously develop the production of non-staple foods to achieve "sales every month, evergreen in all seasons." Cultural, educational, health, and collective welfare undertakings will also be further consolidated and developed.

    把城市人民进一步组织起来建设社会主义新城市
    郑州市管城区红旗人民公社成长壮大
    建社前工业产品7种，月产值700元，现有工厂47个，产品242种，1959年总产值655万元，今年2月又增到356万元
    举办了58个公共食堂、7所小学、15个托儿所、1个敬老院、171个居民服务点，呈现出一片幸福团结的新气象
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省最早建立的一个城市人民公社——郑州市管城区红旗人民公社，从1958年8月建社以来，在党的正确领导下，贯彻“以生产为中心，生产生活一齐抓”的方针，大力发展生产，全面组织了人民经济生活。现在，这个解放前穷困的棚户区里，已经建立了四十多个工厂，五十多个食堂，还办了许多集体福利事业、服务事业和文化事业，出现了一片蓬蓬勃勃的新景象。
    红旗人民公社是1958年8月15日成立的。这个公社位于郑州市旧城区，居民大部分是市民和职工家属，历来比较穷困。解放后，政府每年要拨款五万多元救济这里的居民，其中有一百八十户、五百四十多人常年依靠政府救济为生。1957年整风和反右派运动以后，广大群众的思想觉悟空前提高，迫切要求组织起来参加社会主义建设。1958年，中共党组织根据群众的要求，积极领导这里的群众掀起了一个“街街巷巷办工厂，家家户户无闲人”的全民办工业的高潮。为了解决大批家庭妇女参加生产后没有时间从事家务劳动的矛盾，又出现了第一个由二十一户居民办起来的公共食堂和托儿所。他们推倒三个院的界墙，组成了一个“社会主义大院”。1958年夏天人民公社化高潮中，红旗人民公社就在广大群众的迫切要求下应运而生。
    红旗人民公社是以城市街道居民为主组织起来的，共有六个分社，社员一万八千七百二十九人，目前在街道社员中，参加公社工业生产的有二千四百二十一人，参加农业生产的有八百七十五人，参加各项福利、商业、服务事业的有六百四十八人，支援国营工厂的有四百三十人。其中有三千四百零三人（妇女有二千六百四十八人）是建社后参加生产和工作的，占全社闲散劳动力的97％。公社共兴办了四十七个工厂和一个农业大队，还办了七所小学，有学生三千五百五十多人。全社还成立了一个民兵师。
    红旗人民公社建立的一年多中，在各项事业中都显示了无比的优越性和强大的生命力。
    公社兴办的工厂中，有化工厂、电机制造厂、味精厂、印刷装订厂、打字蜡纸厂、缝纫厂、制鞋厂等。这些社办工厂建立以后，在短短的一年多中就发挥了巨大的力量。建社以前的1958年7月，那里的民办工业总产值只有七百元，产品只有七种，而从8月份成立公社后到12月止，全社工业总产值即达十九万元，产品达到二十三种；1959年社办工业总产值又猛增到六百五十五万多元，产品达到二百四十二种。今年2月份，产值更猛增到三百五十六万元，比公社成立前1958年7月产值七百元增加五千零八十多倍。群众高兴地说：“千年万年，不如公社一年”。社办工业对国家工业建设、发展农业生产和改善人民生活都起了积极作用。一年多来，全社四十七个工厂生产了大批三酸、两碱、火硝、焦炭、电焊条、纱包线、耐火材料等工业用品。在支援农业生产方面，他们修配了各种动力机械五百多部，生产了蓖麻饼二百多吨。由于社办工业的壮大和直接为国营工厂服务，就自然而然地成了国营工厂的卫星厂，例如社办的印刷装订厂现在每月就为地方国营工厂印刷各种表格四十万份，装订信封、卷宗二十七万多个，供应纸盒十四万五千多个，成为国营工厂的有力助手。去年秋天，郑州市西郊公社急要把一个二十八瓩的电动机改装成发电机，大修配厂无暇改装，公社办的电机厂就连夜把它改装成功。公社办的缝纫厂和制鞋工厂，一年多来生产了大批服装、布鞋，源源供应了市场。挂上钩的国营工厂也积极帮助公社发展工业，一年多来，国营工厂为红旗人民公社培养训练了四百七十多名技术人员，还供应了大批下脚料，解决了社办工业原料不足的困难。
    在大力发展工业生产的同时，公社的农业生产也获得了巨大成绩，全社农业比重不大，只有耕地一千五百九十二亩，但是为了促进农业生产，建社以后，就增添大型动力机械和排灌机械八十九部，加速了农业技术的改造，1959年全社小麦比1958年增产78％以上，秋季作物在百日大旱的情况下，依然增产10％，蔬菜也增产103％，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。
    在发展生产的同时，公社还兴办了以公共食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业，全社共建立社办食堂五十八个。全公社95％以上的人口都在食堂就餐。食堂从成立以来，处处为方便群众着想，尽可能满足各种人的不同要求，群众称赞说：“人民公社化，万户是一家，生活搞得好，生产干劲大”。全社还建立托儿所十五个，入托儿童一千七百七十五人。公社还办了一个敬老院。根据社员生产、生活的需要，公社还建立了一个服务总站、六个服务站、一百七十一个服务点，这些服务性行业的业务包括服装拆洗、缝补、改旧翻新，临时托儿，照顾病人产妇，办理婚、丧事等，另外还建立了地区性的综合商店，大大方便了群众。生活集体化不仅把妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，而且为国家节约了大量物资，仅炊事用煤每年就能节约二千吨以上。
    随着生产的发展，社员的生活也相应地得到提高，这个地区的大部分居民过去一家只有一个或两个人参加工作，有固定的收入。公社成立以后，大批消费人口成了劳动者，每月都有一定的工资，97％的社员都增加了收入。过去国家每年支出的五万多元救济费中，现在可以节约四万五千多元。社员的生活有了显著改善。建社初期社员的平均工资是九点八四元，1959年6月份就上升到十七元，现在除补助工资外平均每月工资已达到二十二元。社员马代见全家三口人，公社成立前只有一个女儿参加工作，每月收入十八元，常年依靠政府救济；公社成立后，马代见和她的婆婆也参加了生产，全家三人每月收入共七十多元，比过去提高三倍多。法院东街六十多岁的马大娘参加生产后领到了工资，给孙子买了一套新衣服，她自豪地说：“奶奶一辈子双手朝天向人要钱，现在可有了自己的钱了，奶奶感谢共产党，感谢毛主席，感谢好公社！”
  在组织社员经济生活的同时，公社还组织了群众的文化生活，成立了文化宫、阅览室、图书室、电影放映队、广播站，群众文娱生活空前活跃。公社成立后社员自编自写的诗歌有三万多篇，剧本有五十多个，已经基本上扫除了文盲。
    随着公社的巩固和发展，旧城市街道的面貌也在逐渐改观。公社建立后，新建与修建房屋三千七百多间，整修街道十五条，新建与改良了厕所三百五十个，种树三十万株，目前还正在建筑工厂厂房、社员住宅、集体生活福利和商业服务设施、学校等。
    人民公社建立以后，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。过去那种各自一家、互不关心、常为琐事争吵的现象已经一去不复返了。现在，公社里到处是一片和睦团结、互敬互助的新气象。公社成立前，清真寺街八十五户居民中，家庭不和、邻里不睦的有二十八户，街道办事处每天要调解民事纠纷十多起。现在家家户户乐融融。胡玉凤和她的婆婆过去经常争吵，公社成立后，胡玉凤参加了生产，觉悟提高了，生活也有了改善，婆媳两人都成了尊婆爱媳的好榜样。马世江和巴世仁隔墙居住，七年不说话，现在一起工作和生活，解开了多年的老疙瘩。群众歌颂说：“人民公社一枝花，花开一朵香万家，千年疙瘩一朝解，团结生产笑哈哈”。由于群众觉悟提高，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，迅速掀起了大搞技术革新和技术革命的高潮。一年多来，涌现出各种先进人物六百三十七名，实现技术革新一千三百多项。许多过去围着锅台转的家庭妇女，成了各个生产战线上的先进人物。打字蜡纸厂的女社员制成了技术比较复杂的打字蜡纸和修正液，工厂买不到生产打字蜡纸需要的油酸，他们就刻苦钻研，到处求师请教，结果只花五十元就用土法试制成功。
    红旗人民公社的社员今年树起了更大的雄心壮志，当前全社生产一片红火。全社今年计划工业总产值要达到三千五百万元，将比去年增长四点四倍，并且根据城市需要的特点，大量发展副食品生产，做到“月月有售，四季常青”，文教卫生和集体福利事业也要进一步巩固和发展。
