Xinhua News Agency, March 31st -- According to a TASS report from March 30th: The press office of the Greek United Democratic Left Party reported that delegations of residents from many districts and suburbs of Athens, as well as delegations from the provinces, recently met with parliamentarians, political and social figures, and prominent journalists from Greek newspapers, expressing the demand of the Greek working people for the release of Glezos and the normalization of the domestic political situation.

One of Greece's most famous composers, Kalomiris, and the renowned scientist Professor Kalitsounakis, both advocated for the release of Glezos. Skassis, a member of the Academy of Athens, said that the military court's verdict against Glezos was "unjust." Former Minister Vavoutis believes that the request for Glezos's release is legitimate. Members of Parliament Mikhas and Manedis from the ruling "National Radical Union," as well as four Liberal Party members of parliament, also advocated for the normalization of the domestic political situation, which includes the authorities ceasing their persecution of Greek democrats, including Glezos.

Today, the statement of the Executive Committee of the United Democratic Left Party was published in the newspaper. The statement pointed out: "The Supreme Court should recognize that the military court has no right to try the Glezos case."

In this statement, the Executive Committee of the United Democratic Left Party called on the Greek public to strengthen the struggle to abolish Law No. 375, because the trial of Glezos was conducted under this law, and the military court is preparing to conduct new trials of Greek democrats under this law.

    希腊公众舆论发出呼吁
    要求释放格列索斯
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社30日讯：希腊统一民主左翼党新闻处报道，雅典许多区和市郊居民代表团以及省的代表团最近会见了议员、政界和社会人士以及希腊各报纸的著名记者，向他们表达了希腊劳动人民要求释放格列索斯和使国内政治局势正常化。
    希腊著名的作曲家之一卡洛米里斯和著名的科学家卡利楚纳基斯教授都主张释放格列索斯。雅典科学院成员斯卡西斯说，军事法庭对格列索斯的判决是“不公正的”。前大臣瓦武蒂斯认为关于释放格列索斯的请求是合法的。执政党“国民激进联盟”议员米哈斯和马内迪斯以及四名自由党议员也主张使国内政治局势正常化，这包括当局停止对希腊民主人士，其中包括对格列索斯的迫害。
    今天在报上发表了统一民主左翼党执行委员会的声明。声明指出：“最高法院应当承认军事法庭无权审理格列索斯案件。”
    在这篇声明中，统一民主左翼党执行委员会呼吁希腊公众加强争取废除第三百七十五号法律的斗争，因为对格列索斯的审讯就是根据这一法律进行的，而且军事法庭正在准备根据这一法律对希腊民主人士进行新的审讯。
