    I would like to first express my heartfelt support for the report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese Political Consultative Conference.

    Now, please allow us to talk about the issue of people's communes in mountainous areas using reservoirs as bases for developing fisheries.

    One often hears the term "land of fish and rice." This refers to affluent areas that have both rice and fish. In the old social system of the past, farmers had to rely on the heavens for their livelihoods. Those areas with relatively good natural environmental conditions, especially water conservancy conditions, were not afraid of drought or flooding in their fields, and also had nearby bodies of water where they could catch or raise fish. Their living requirements were not high; being able to have rice and fish was considered the best possible situation. In the end, areas with good natural water conservancy conditions were not many. As for mountainous or hilly areas, they were prone to mountain floods when it rained, and drought when there was no rain. It was difficult enough to have white rice to eat, let alone fish. It was simply impossible to find a "land of fish and rice."

    Since liberation, after land reform and agricultural cooperativization, coupled with the start of water conservancy work in 1957, the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the emergence of the great people's communes, the construction of farmland water conservancy in 1959 developed unprecedentedly, fundamentally changing the situation in mountainous areas. For example, Macheng has seen the emergence of 150,000 mu of water surface in recent years; the 12 counties of the Huanggang Special District each have an average of 70,000 to 80,000 mu of newly built water surface. These newly built water surfaces are mainly reservoirs, and they are all located in mountainous areas. In 1960, the directive of Vice Premier Li Fuchun will be further implemented: "...water conservancy construction, according to the principle of 'storage, small-scale, and mass participation' as the mainstay, combined with large, medium, and small-scale projects." There is no doubt that the number of reservoirs in mountainous areas will greatly increase.

    **Reservoir Fish Farming Increases the Comprehensive Utilization of Reservoirs**

    Tens of thousands of small reservoirs were originally for the comprehensive utilization of flood control, irrigation, and power generation, but in fact, they also laid a solid foundation for the development of fisheries by people's communes in mountainous areas. Adding the comprehensive utilization project of reservoirs—fisheries—does not conflict with the original flood control, irrigation, and power generation purposes. If the 150,000 mu of reservoirs in Macheng are used for fish farming, and each mu of water surface produces 15 jin of fish per year according to the fish production of natural lakes in Hubei Province, then 2.25 million jin of fish can be produced annually. Although this number is not large, it is still considerable when distributed among the sparsely populated people's communes in mountainous areas. It must be pointed out that 15 jin of fish production per mu is only the initial estimate for the first year of fish farming. This is the lowest estimate, and it can definitely be increased year by year. In this way, places where it was impossible to find a land of fish and rice in the mountainous areas of the past will soon be full of new types of lands of fish and rice.

    **Carry out Reservoir Clearing Work to Prepare for Future Fishing**

    Currently, the use of reservoirs for fish farming is not without problems. Many reservoirs that were completed three or four years ago have already been used for fish farming, and the fish are growing very well. However, the problem is that these reservoirs were rushed to store water due to the urgency of time, and were not cleared. The bottom of the reservoir still has obstacles such as tree trunks and building foundations, making it impossible to use larger-scale nets to catch fish. It can be seen that there are many fish, but they cannot be caught. Therefore, when building reservoirs, it must be recognized that fish farming is one of the important comprehensive utilization projects of the reservoir. The reservoir must be cleared before it is filled with water to prepare for future fishing. This is a problem that must be solved regarding reservoir fish farming.

    Many people mistakenly believe that clearing the base means cleaning the entire bottom of the reservoir. As a result, they feel that the investment is too large and they cannot start. In fact, this is not the case. The so-called clearing the base only means selecting a few suitable locations as fixed fishing grounds in the future and carrying out thorough cleaning work. Two or three places are enough for a small reservoir, and at most no more than four or five places. Therefore, the area is not very large, and can also be varied depending on the size of the reservoir, the amount of investment, and the labor force. After the location is selected, shrubs, tree stumps, building foundations, etc. on the ground should be removed, and graves, ditches, and embankments should be leveled to ensure that large-scale bottom trawls can be used in the future without encountering obstacles or leaking fish from the bottom of the net. The selection of the location of the fishing ground must be considered in conjunction with the type of net to be used in the future and the habitat of the fish. Currently, in general, small reservoirs can use large seine nets (also known as ground drag nets) as the main net, so it is most suitable to have relatively flat slopes along the banks of the reservoir. If those areas were originally cultivated land or grassland, they are places with relatively abundant fish feed after being submerged by water, and larger schools of fish can inhabit here. The area of the fishing ground can be large or small, one or two li in circumference or even larger. The size of the range determines the length of the large seine net; the maximum depth of the slope determines the height of the net, but it should not be too deep.

    If there is a bay with a relatively narrow outlet, it can be used as a whole as a fishing ground. When fishing in the future, methods can be found to drive the fish in the reservoir into the bay, and then use a barrage net to block the outlet. Concentrated fishing in the bay is the most effective method. Such bays also need to be thoroughly cleared.

    Another question, what should be done with existing reservoirs that were not cleared before filling with water? Under the current circumstances, these small reservoirs that have not been cleared must still use ground seine nets. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to supplement the clearing during the lowest dry season. The principle of clearing is the same as mentioned above, but supplementary clearing is limited to above the dead water level. Being able to clear a few fishing grounds and use large-scale nets is much more cost-effective than not clearing the base and only being able to use small nets with extremely low efficiency.

    **Reservoir Fish Farming Must Rely on Stocking Fry**

    The last question we want to talk about is the issue of fish fry. Most small reservoirs do not have rivers flowing into them. Even if they do, they are only small streams. Therefore, after the reservoir is built, the original fish fauna has no great economic value and must rely on stocking fish fry. Currently, most people buy grass carp, carp, silver carp, and bighead carp fry and put them into the reservoir. This is a simple method, but the investment is relatively large. Otherwise, they must cultivate fish fry into fingerlings themselves. To cultivate fish fry themselves, they can use the original ponds of the people's communes; otherwise, they can also select some small bays along the reservoir area with an area of ​​tens of mu (suitable for those with a water depth of no more than five or six feet at high water level), and build an earthen dam at the outlet of the bay to make the bay a separate small body of water as a place for cultivating fish fry. This method has been quite effective in the Changshou Lake Reservoir in Sichuan. Fish fry can be released into the reservoir after being cultivated to a length of two or three inches in a short period of time. At present, when labor, fertilizer sources, and feed are tight in the communes, it is most appropriate for reservoir fish farming to not require feeding or fertilization, and to grow by utilizing the naturally growing food in the reservoir. Therefore, the fish fry stocked in the reservoir should be sparse (stocking 15 or more per mu). If they grow well, they can be increased the following year. The proportion of fish stocked must be determined based on the situation of the natural food. In general, more silver carp and bighead carp should be stocked, followed by grass carp and carp; black carp are generally rarely stocked or not stocked at all. The following year, the proportion can be changed depending on the growth of various fish.

    In short, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party, the rapid water conservancy construction in the past three years has brought an unprecedented new look to the rural areas of mountainous areas. In particular, the emergence of tens of thousands of small reservoirs has laid the foundation for the development of fisheries in the people's communes in mountainous areas. The current problem is to do a good job in reservoir clearing. Because mountainous areas still lack experience in fish farming, reservoir fish farming can only be extensive at the beginning, and then move towards establishing specialized teams, fish fry bases, and training technical cadres, carrying out large-scale experiments to rapidly increase reservoir fish production. Vigorously carry out technological revolution, so that fisheries production moves towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. "Fish farming is originally an extremely profitable business." It not only improves people's lives, but more importantly, strengthens the economy of the communes, so that the production of industry and agriculture can develop at a higher speed.

    山区水库养鱼一本万利
    伍献文、吴德简委员的联合发言
    我首先表示衷心地拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈叔通副主席所作的政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在请允许我们谈一谈关于山区的人民公社以水库为发展渔业基地的问题。
    时常听人说“鱼米之乡”。这是指既有米又有鱼的富饶地区。在从前旧的社会制度下，农民只好靠天吃饭。那些自然环境条件，特别是水利条件，比较好的地区，有田不怕干涝，还有邻近水体，可以捕鱼或者养鱼，生活要求不高，能有米有鱼就觉得最好没有了。到底天然的水利条件好的地区并不多，至于山区或者丘陵地带，有雨成山洪，无雨成旱灾，求吃白米饭尚且困难，何况求吃鱼，就此无法找到“鱼米之乡”。
    解放以后，经过土地改革，农业合作化，加之1957年开始搞水利，1958年大跃进、伟大的人民公社出现，1959年农田水利的建设更是史无前例得到发展，使山区的情形起了根本性变化。例如麻城这几年来已经出现了十五万亩的水面；黄冈专区十二个县，每个县平均有七、八万亩新建的水面。这些新建的水面主要是水库，而且全在山区。1960年更将贯彻李富春副总理指示“……水利建设，按照‘蓄、小、群’为主和大中小型工程相结合的方针”，毫无疑义，山区水库还会大大地增多。
    水库养鱼增加水库的综合利用项目
    数以万计的小型水库，原为防洪、灌溉、发电的综合利用，实际上也为山区的人民公社发展渔业奠定了坚固的基础。增加水库的综合利用项目——渔业，和原定防洪、灌溉、发电，绝无矛盾。如果以麻城十五万亩的水库加以养鱼，每亩水面照湖北省天然湖泊捕涝的鱼产量十五斤计算，每年可出鱼二百二十五万斤。这个数字虽然不大，但是将它分配在山区人口比较稀疏的人民公社，也就很可观了。必须指出的，每亩十五斤鱼产量只是在开始头一年养鱼，这是从最低估算，以后决可以逐年提高，这样，从前山区找不到鱼米之乡，不久就会遍地皆是新型的鱼米之乡了。
    进行水库清基工作为将来捕鱼作好准备
    目前利用水库养鱼，不是完全没有问题。有不少在三、四年前完成的水库都已经养了鱼，并且鱼也长得很好。但是问题在于这些水库都因时间紧迫，急于蓄水，没有经过清基，库底遗留有树干、屋基等障碍物，使无法用较大型网具来捕鱼，眼看到有很多的鱼而无法捕起来，因此，在修建水库的时候，就须认定养鱼是水库综合利用重要项目之一，在水库灌水之前必须进行清基，为将来捕鱼作好准备。这是目前有关水库养鱼的一个必须解决的问题。
    有不少人误会了清基是清理全部库底，于是，感觉到投资太大，有无法动手的情况。其实不是如此。所谓清基只是选择几个适当的地点作为将来固定的捕捞场而进行彻底清整工作。一个小型水库有二、三处，至多不过四、五处就够了，所以范围不是很大，还可以看水库大小、投资多少、劳动力的情况，而有所变动。地点选定之后，就将地面上的灌木、树桩、屋基等加以清除，坟墓、沟道和堤埂等加以平整，务使将来利用大型着底网具时，不致发生阻碍或者有网底漏鱼的事情。选择捕捞场的地点须与将来所采用的网型和鱼类栖息地点结合起来考虑。目前情形，一般小型水库可取大拉网（或称地曳网）为主要网具，于是就应该以沿库边地段而有较平坦的斜坡为最适合。如果那些地段原为耕地，或者草地，经水淹没之后都是鱼类食料比较丰富的地点，可以有更大的鱼群在此栖息。捕捞场面积可大可小，周一、二里或更大都可以，范围大小决定了大拉网的长度；斜坡最深度决定了网的高度，但不宜太深。
    如果有出口比较狭的库湾可以整个用作捕捞场，将来捕鱼时可设法将库里的鱼赶到湾里来，然后用栏网在出口拦起来。集中在湾内捕捞，这是最有效的办法。这样的库湾同样地须彻底清基。
    另外一个问题，在灌水前没有清基的已成水库应该怎样办？这些没有清过基的小型水库，在目前情形下还必须采用着地的大拉网，因此，就必须在最低枯水时期设法补行清基，清基的原则与上面所说的相同，但补行清基只限于死水位以上罢了。能清出几个捕捞场，可以使用大型网具比之不清基只能使用效率极低的小型网合算得多。
    水库养鱼必须依靠放养鱼种
    最后一个问题我们要说的是鱼种问题。多数的小水库没有河流灌注，即使有，也不过是小溪流，所以水库建成之后，原有鱼类区系没有大的经济价值，必须依靠放养鱼种。目前情形，多数是买草、鲤、鲢、鳙的鱼种放入水库，这是一种简便的办法，但是投资比较大。不是如此，就须自行从鱼苗培养成鱼种。自己培养鱼种，可以利用人民公社原有堰塘；否则，也可选择水库沿岸区域一些面积数十亩大小的小库湾（以高水位时水深不过五、六尺者为适），在湾的出口处筑一条土堤，使库湾成为一个分离的小水体，作为培养鱼种场所。这个办法，在四川长寿湖水库试行颇为有效。鱼种在短期内培养至二、三寸长度时即可放入水库。在目前公社中劳动力、肥源、饲料都感紧张时，水库养鱼无需投食施肥，利用水库中天然生长的食料而生长最为适宜。因此，库中所放鱼种宜疏（每亩放十五条或较多），如果生长良好，翌年可以增加。所放鱼类的比例须看天然食料的情形而定，一般情形，宜多放鲢、鳙，次之为草鱼和鲤鱼；如消落区杂草长得茂盛，也可多放草鱼。青鱼一般是极少放或不放。第二年可看各种鱼的生长情况而改变比例。
    总之，由于党的英明领导，三年来飞跃的水利建设，使山区农村出现了史无前例的新面貌，尤其是成万的小型水库的出现，就奠定了山区人民公社渔业发展的基础。目前的问题是做好水库清基工作。因山区对于养鱼尚感经验不够，所以开始水库养鱼只好粗放，随即走向建立专业队、鱼种基地和培养技术干部，大搞试验，使水库鱼产量迅速提高。大搞技术革命，使渔业生产走向机械化、半机械化。“养鱼本来是一本万利”，他不仅为改善人民生活，更重要的是壮大公社的经济，使工农业的生产有更高速度的发展。
