Jilin Launches Mass Movement to Vigorously Promote Comprehensive Utilization
　　Jilin Province is launching a massive mass movement to comprehensively utilize resources. Since the movement began in February, it has now expanded to industries such as chemical, light industry, metallurgy, and machinery. The scope of comprehensive utilization is very broad, ranging from industrial raw materials to waste gas, waste liquid, waste residue, and from agricultural and sideline products to wild animals and plants.

Cement Factories Follow Small Blast Furnaces
　　Sichuan Province has launched a mass movement where cement factories are built wherever there are blast furnaces to produce slag cement. By the end of March, fifteen regions and cities in the province had begun producing cement, and sixty-one new slag cement workshops (factories) had been built. Many regions and cities in the province, in the spirit of "cement following metallurgy," have established cement offices and headquarters to vigorously promote slag cement production.

Technical Revolution Ideation Meetings
　　Dalian Shipyard has created a new form of mass brainstorming - ideation meetings. These ideation meetings target key production points, combining individual and collective ideas, and dissecting work types while ideating. As a result, in less than a month, more than 43,900 innovation topics were proposed, and more than 11,000 were solved.

Anshan Iron and Steel Achieves Excellent Open Hearth Utilization Rate
　　The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, rejuvenating the old factory, with the open hearth utilization coefficient reaching 10.55, leaping to the advanced level of the world's similar large open hearth utilization coefficients.

Using Industrial Waste to Vigorously Build Construction Materials
　　The workers of Tianjin City put forward the resounding slogan: "Use the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in Steel to vigorously develop construction materials from industrial waste." Currently, the city utilizes 5,000 tons of industrial waste every day, an increase of 60% compared to March. Water-quenched slag is used to make wet-milled slag concrete components such as factory floor slabs, crane beams, and high-grade road surfaces. Using industrial waste to vigorously build construction materials effectively supports the sustained leap forward in basic construction.

Doing "Ten Good Deeds" to Develop Agriculture
　　The workers of Shantou City put forward the slogan of doing "Ten Good Deeds" to develop agriculture. These ten good deeds are: 1. Supporting rural areas in achieving motorized transport and shipping; 2. Helping to develop commune industries; 3. Helping communes achieve steam-powered dining halls; 4. Helping communes establish small hydropower stations; 5. Sending technology to the countryside; 6. Sending labor to the countryside; 7. Supporting the fight against drought; 8. Helping to train technical personnel; 9. Vigorously producing agricultural fertilizer and pesticides; 10. Helping to repair agricultural tools and machinery.

Industrial Design Vigorously Engages in Technical Revolution
　　In order to improve the technical level of coking and refractory material production, the Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute launched a major revolution in design content. The focus of the design content revolution is on major key points in the great development of production technology such as "any coal can be coked," "inferior materials can be made into good refractory bricks," "investment and personnel are reduced by half," "production capacity is doubled," and "increased recovery of by-products." Therefore, it is of great significance for further consolidating the results of innovation.

Changchun Factory Achieves 100% Raw Material Utilization Rate
　　Changchun Erdaohezi District Daily Chemical Factory vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, increasing the utilization rate of raw materials from 47% in the past to 100%, becoming a zero-waste factory. This factory even uses sewage and waste residue to make feed, fertilizer, and bone glue.

Zhengzhou East Station Makes Major Innovations in Less-Than-Carload Freight Handling
　　After basically achieving mechanization of full carload freight handling, Zhengzhou East Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau concentrated its efforts on attacking the technical revolution of less-than-carload freight handling. By April 10, it had manufactured various indigenous and foreign combined loading and unloading tools such as gantry cranes, rail-laying machines, crab claw conveyors, unmanned electric shovels, and electric rail locomotives.

Using Locomotive Electric Shovels and Other Equipment to Generate Electricity
　　The workers of the Maoming Petroleum City open-pit mine in Guangdong used steam locomotives and walking electric shovel generators to build a temporary power generation project with a power generation capacity of 50 kilowatts, greatly alleviating the contradiction of insufficient power caused by the mechanization of the mining area.

    要闻快报
    吉林开展群众运动大搞综合利用
    吉林省正在开展一个声势浩大的综合利用资源的群众运动。运动从2月份开展以来，目前已扩展到化工、轻工、冶金、机械等行业。综合利用的范围很广，从工业的原料材料到废气、废液、废渣，从农副产品到野生动植物。
    水泥厂随着小高炉走
    四川省掀起了一个那里有高炉，就在那里建设水泥厂生产矿渣水泥的群众运动。到3月底，全省已有十五个专区和市开始生产水泥，新建矿渣水泥车间（厂）六十一个。全省许多专区和市，都本着“水泥跟着冶金走”的精神，成立了水泥办公室、指挥部，大抓矿渣水泥生产。
    技术革命设想会
    大连造船厂创造出一种群众性集思广益的新形式——设想会。这种设想会是针对生产关键，把个人的设想和集体的设想结合起来，边设想边进行工种解剖。这样做的结果，不到一个月就提出了四万三千九百多项革新课题，并且解决了一万一千多项。
    鞍钢创平炉利用系数优异成绩
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，使老厂返老还童，平炉利用系数高达十点五五，跃上了世界同类大型平炉利用系数的先进水平。
    利用工业废料大造建筑材料
    天津市职工提出了：“用大炼钢铁的精神，利用工业废料大搞建筑材料”的响亮口号。目前全市每天利用工业废料达五千吨，比3月份提高了60％。水淬矿渣制成的湿辗矿渣混凝土构件有：厂房楼板、吊车梁、高级路面等。利用工业废料大造建筑材料，是有效地支援了基本建设的持续跃进。
