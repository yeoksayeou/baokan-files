Consecutive Three Years of Bumper Harvests of Tangerines
中共黄岩县委会 (The Communist Party of China Huangyan County Committee)

Under the kind leadership of the Party Central Committee, and the provincial and prefectural Party committees, Zhejiang Province's Huangyan County's tangerine production, following the path pointed out by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, overcame the extraordinary floods and frequent natural disasters in 1959, enabling agricultural production to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward on the basis of the extraordinary leap forward in 1958. The county's 23,000 mu of fruit-bearing tangerine orchards, based on continuous increases in production in 1957 and 1958, still achieved an overall bumper harvest, yielding more than 600,000 dan of tangerines, with an average yield of 2,650 jin per mu, basically eliminating the traditional "big year, small year" phenomenon in tangerine production.

In the large-scale bumper harvest of 1959, unprecedented high-yield records such as thousand-jin trees, ten-thousand-jin plots, twenty-thousand-jin orchards, and five-thousand-jin teams emerged. In addition, single plants yielding five hundred jin, fruits weighing half a jin, and clusters of fruits were commonly seen in various locations. These achievements are the result of the emancipation of thought and bold innovation by the masses in the tangerine-producing areas under the leadership of the Party. These facts reveal the infinite potential for increasing tangerine production.

	Grasp Technical Measures Firmly

The bumper harvest of tangerine production over the past year is a victory in the struggle against nature. In summary, the measures we adopted last year to combat nature were: break through "three barriers" and implement "four modernizations." Breaking through the "three barriers" means: after harvesting the previous year, making a major breakthrough in the safe overwintering barrier; when spring warms and flowers bloom, making a major breakthrough in the flower and fruit preservation barrier; and during the green fruit growth period, making a major breakthrough in the waterlogging and fruit growth barrier. Implementing the "four modernizations" means: vigorously promoting water conservancy in tangerine orchards, scientific fertilization, battle-style pest control, and high-standardized management.

	(1) Water Conservancy in Tangerine Orchards: According to the scientific conclusion that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture," and in accordance with the characteristics of flat-land cultivation of tangerines in this county, the measures required to be promoted are: "digging deep ditches in every row, having surrounding ditches for every plot, connecting small ditches to large ditches, and connecting large ditches to rivers and ponds, to achieve "able to drain, able to irrigate, and able to store." In 1959, we overcame the continuous drought of more than a month in the orchards. Fruit trees rarely experienced phenomena such as leaf curling, leaf drop, and branch dieback, which is inseparable from our vigorous development of water conservancy in tangerine orchards.

	(2) Scientific Fertilization: Huangyan tangerine farmers have a habit of applying fertilizer twice, "before flowering and after harvesting," but the requirements of rapidly developing production require more fertilizer. In 1959, we put forward the slogan of scientific fertilization. Scientific fertilization means: both frequent application of light fertilizer, and four observations and three combinations. The four observations are observing the tree vigor, the variety, the soil quality, and the climate; the "three combinations" are the combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers, the combination of quick-acting and slow-acting fertilizers, and the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers. In 1959, fertilization was divided into six times: after harvest, before budding, during flowering, during the young fruit stage, during the fruit setting stage, and during the fruit growth stage. After the harvest in 1958, fertilizer was applied immediately after harvesting, reaching 90%, which enabled the tangerine trees to quickly recover their vigor and ensure safe overwintering.

In addition, foliar spraying was also used in fertilization methods. In fruit preservation technology, 2,4-D growth regulator was also used on a large scale.

	(3) Battle-Style Pest Control: Thoroughly eliminating pests is an outstanding barrier to ensuring increased tangerine production. In 1959, cottony cushion scale, yellow spiders, aphids, leafroller caterpillars, and other pests occurred continuously. Just at the critical juncture of fruit preservation, pests seriously affected the tangerine fruits. If the pests were not eliminated in time, the tangerine fruits would inevitably be harmed by the pests and fall off. The Party organizations in the tangerine-producing areas promptly regarded eliminating pests as their own combat task, mobilized the whole Party and the whole people, using both manual labor and pesticides, to carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression.

	(4) High-Standardized Management: The requirements for high standards of tangerine orchard management are four "no's": no weeds, no dead branches, no moldy stumps, and no tree moss. Two major orchard cleanups were carried out in winter and autumn. In regular management, timely weeding was achieved, generally reaching one hoeing after each rain, with 14 to 20 weedings throughout the year, so the tangerine orchards remained consistently clean. In soil management, a comprehensive soil cultivation was carried out.

	Strengthen Party Leadership

The bumper tangerine harvest in 1959 was also a victory in the struggle between the two roads and two lines in politics under the leadership of the Party.

	(1) Break Down Conservative Thinking, Adhere to the General Line, and Strive for High Speed. After the bumper harvest in the tangerine-producing areas in 1958, complacency and relaxation of efforts, as well as slackening of leadership in winter production, once emerged. A group of people with serious conservative thinking secretly peddled the already criticized "big year, small year" theory and the "conditions" theory, saying: "There will be no leap forward in 1959, because it is a 'big growth year,' fertilizer is lacking, and the tree bodies are weak." Some masses also had some wavering confidence in increasing production in 1959. In view of this situation, the Party promptly criticized these ideas, vigorously established advanced models of high-yield increases, analyzed the good situation and favorable conditions for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959, and proposed the target of ensuring 4,000 jin and striving for 5,000 jin, while vigorously promoting production, and the masses' leap forward enthusiasm was stimulated again. According to the experience of comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in recent years, the county Party committee also put forward the policy of "taking grain as the key link, and promoting grain, tangerines, and animal husbandry simultaneously" to the tangerine-producing areas according to local conditions. In order to strengthen the leadership of tangerine production, the Party committees at all levels, under the premise of the secretary taking the lead, implemented a division of labor and responsibility among the committee members, with a deputy secretary or committee member in charge of tangerine production, from the commune to the production team and the small team, all the way to the front line, thereby ensuring the complete implementation of the policy and various measures.

	(2) Vigorously Grasp Advanced Models, Establish Pace-Setters, and Carry Out the Movement of Learning, Catching Up, Overcoming, and Helping. The entire county seized on the Huijiang Production Team, which achieved "full red marks in all aspects of production" and "high yields of tangerines year after year," as a model, and launched a competition movement of learning from Huijiang, catching up with Huijiang, and surpassing Huijiang Team. At the same time, it also focused on the Xia Ling Production Team, which had been without "big year, small year" for six consecutive years, and the Huoxing, Dongfang, Daixi, and Huangxi Production Teams, which had achieved high yields year after year, to help these teams improve their production in a planned way, so that they could lead in all aspects of production, with everyone chasing after each other and competing with each other. In this way, they not only promoted their own leap forward, but also drove the entire production movement in the tangerine-producing areas. The main methods of grasping advanced models and establishing pace-setters were to organize visits, inspections, evaluations, and on-site meetings, ensuring that meetings were held wherever there were advanced models. In 1959, more than ten on-site meetings were held in the Huijiang and other production teams, and more than 20 advanced experiences were promoted.

	(3) Rely on the Strength of Communes to Improve Business Management. After the people's communes were established, with the development of collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, the labor force of women was thoroughly liberated, which created conditions for solving the contradiction between grain and tangerine labor. During the busy farming season, it was possible for men to work in the fields and women to enter the tangerine orchards, achieving the goal of not neglecting either grain or tangerine production. After communization, labor could be adjusted and supported mutually. In addition, after communization, the interplanted land and tangerine orchards were generally adjusted from the perspective of benefiting production. In this way, not only were the costs of management saved, but also the potential for increased production was brought into play due to strengthened management, and the low-yielding orchards passed down for generations were transformed. The communes implemented a "three guarantees and one reward" responsibility system from top to bottom, which also had a huge effect on giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses.

	(4) Major Collaboration Among Departments to Promote Large-Scale Increase in Tangerine Production. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, all systems in the tangerine-producing areas have done a lot of work to strive for a bumper tangerine harvest in 1959. The purchasing departments participated in production, and in coordination with the agricultural departments, organized a large technical guidance team to regularly go deep into the production teams to provide production guidance.

The experimental research departments went deep into the tangerine orchards of the masses, helped key production teams establish high-yield plots and experimental orchards, and worked with the masses, jointly researching and learning from each other's strengths in production practice. The production materials supply departments and some commune-run industries did everything possible to provide pesticides for tangerines and ensured door-to-door delivery, guaranteeing the timely elimination of pests.

    柑桔连续三年大丰收
    中共黄岩县委会
    浙江省黄岩县的柑桔生产在党中央和省、地委的亲切领导下，沿着八届八中全会指出的道路，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，1959年战胜了特大洪水和频繁的自然灾害，使农业生产在1958年特大跃进的基础上获得了继续大跃进。全县二万三千亩结果桔园，在1957年、1958年连续增产的基础上仍获得全面丰收，收获柑桔六十多万担，平均亩产二千六百五十斤，基本消灭了柑桔生产上传统的“大小年”现象。
    在1959年大面积丰收中，还涌现出千斤树、万斤片、二万斤园、五千斤队等等史无前例的高产纪录。此外，各地还普遍出现了五百斤的单株，半斤重的果实，成串的果穗。这些成绩，是桔区群众在党的领导下解放思想，大胆创造的结果。这些事实，向人们揭示了柑桔增产的无穷潜力。
        狠抓技术措施
    一年来柑桔生产的丰收是向自然界斗争的胜利。总括起来我们去年向自然斗争采取的措施是：破“三关”、搞“四化”。破“三关”即：前年采收以后，大破安全越冬关；春暖花开时，大破保花保果关；青果生长期，大破发水长果关。搞“四化”即：大搞桔园水利化，施肥科学化，治虫战斗化，管理高标准化。
      （一）桔园水利化：根据“水利是农业的命脉”这一科学论断，按照本县柑桔平地栽培的特点，要求推行的措施是：“行行开深沟，块块有围沟，小沟连大沟，大沟通河塘，做到“能排、能灌、能蓄”。1959年我们战胜了持续一个多月的果园干旱，果树很少发生卷叶、落叶、枯枝等现象，和我们大兴桔园水利分不开的。
      （二）施肥科学化，黄岩桔农向有“花前、采后”二次施肥的习惯，可是迅速发展生产的要求还要更多的肥料。1959年我们提出施肥科学化的口号。施肥科学化是：既是薄肥多次，又要四看、三配合。四看即看树势，看品种，看土质，看气候；“三配合”即有机、无机配合，速效迟效配合，氮磷钾配合。1959年施肥分成：采后、芽前、花期、幼果期、定果期和成果期六次。1958年采收后随采随施，达到90％，使桔树树势迅速恢复，保证安全过冬。
    此外，在施肥方法上还运用了根外喷肥。在保果技术上，还大面积运用了二四滴生长素。
    （三）治虫战斗化：彻底消灭虫害，是保障柑桔增产的突出一关。1959年连续发生吹绵蚧、黄蜘蛛、蚜虫、卷叶青虫等虫害。正当保果关口上，虫害严重影响着桔果，若不及时消灭虫害，桔果势必被虫害所危害而落果。桔区党组织把消灭虫害及时当作自己的战斗任务，动员全党全民，人工、药械并举，全面围剿。
      （四）管理高标准化：桔园管理高标准的要求是四无：无杂草、无枯枝、无霉桩、无树藓。在冬季及秋季，开展了两度大清园。在经常管理中，做到及时除草，一般都达到一雨一削，全年除草十四次到二十次，因此桔园保持经常的清洁。在土壤管理上，进行了一次全面培土。
      加强党的领导
    1959年柑桔丰收，也是在党的领导下，在政治上开展两条道路、两条路线斗争的胜利。
      （一）大破保守思想，坚持总路线，力争高速度。桔区自1958年丰收之后，一度出现了自满松劲，放松冬季生产领导的倾向。一批保守思想严重的人又偷偷地贩卖早已批驳的大小年论和条件论，他们说：“1959年不会跃进了，理由是：大生年，肥料缺，树体弱。”有些群众对1959年增产信心也有些动摇。根据这一情况，党及时批判了这些思想，大立高额增产的先进标兵，分析了1959年继续大跃进的良好形势和有利条件，并提出确保四千斤争取五千斤的指标，同时大力促进生产，群众的跃进干劲又激起来了。县委根据几年来农业生产全面跃进的经验，还因地制宜地对桔区提出“以粮为纲，粮桔牧并举”的方针，各级党委为加强柑桔生产领导，在书记挂帅的前提下，实行委员分工负责，由一个副书记或委员主管柑桔生产，从公社到生产队和小队，一线到底，因而保证了方针和各项措施的完整贯彻执行。
      （二）大抓先进、大立标兵，开展学、赶、超、帮的运动。全县抓住生产样样满堂红、柑桔年年创高产的汇江生产队为标兵，开展学汇江、赶汇江、超汇江队的竞赛运动。同时，又掌握了连续六年无大小年的下凌生产队，连年高产的火星、东方、埭西、黄西等生产队为重点，有计划地帮助这些队搞好生产，使他们在各项生产中样样领先，你追我赶，互相竞赛，这样，不仅推动了他们自己的跃进，而且带动了整个桔区的生产运动。抓先进，立标兵的主要方法，是组织参观、检查评比、现场会议，做到那里有先进，就到那里开会。1959年在汇江等生产队共召开过十余次现场会议，推广了二十多项先进经验。
    （三）依靠公社化的力量，改善经营管理。人民公社化后，随着食堂、托儿所、幼儿班等集体福利事业的发展，妇女劳动力得到彻底的解放，这就为解决粮桔劳力矛盾创造条件，在农忙季节，可以做到男人落田洋，妇女进桔园，达到粮桔生产两不误。公社化后，在劳力上可以互相调剂支援。此外，公社化后一般都从有利生产出发，调整了插花土地和桔园，这样，不但节约了管理所花的工本，而且由于加强管理使增产的潜力得到发挥，几代留传下来的低产园被改造了。公社自上而下实行了“三包、一奖”责任制，对于发挥群众的干劲，也具有巨大的作用。
    （四）部门大协作，促进柑桔大增产。在党委的统一领导下，桔区各个系统为争取1959年柑桔丰收都做了不少工作，收购部门参与生产，配合农业部门组织一支庞大的技术指导队伍，经常深入生产队进行生产指导。
    试验研究部门做到深入群众桔园，帮助重点生产队建立丰产片和试验园，与群众打成一片，在生产实践中共同研究，取长补短。生产资料供应部门，和部分社办工业，千方百计地为柑桔提供除虫药剂并做到送货上门，保证了虫害的及时消灭。
