Meeting Residents' Needs, Cultivating Excellent Students
Three Shanghai Housewives Achieve Great Success in Founding Elementary School

(Our report) Shanghai's Xuhui District Jianxiang Residents' Committee's three housewives, Wu Peifang, Yin Zuyi, and Jiang Jingrong, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, started an elementary school from scratch. Because they taught both knowledge and morality, and managed both education and care, the students' academic performance and moral character have been comprehensively improved. In the recent final exam held by the school, the test questions were the same as those of public elementary schools. The percentage of students with excellent and good grades in Chinese was 55.3%, and the percentage of students with excellent and good grades in arithmetic was 82.5%. The average score was no lower than that of general public elementary schools. Several children with poor morals have become honest and lovely children after more than a year of education.

This private elementary school has only been around for one year and nine months. At the beginning, they encountered many difficulties. First of all, the three of them were not highly educated and lacked teaching experience. The main teacher, Wu Peifang, only improved from semi-illiterate to junior high school graduate after liberation. However, they did not waver. They saw that during the Great Leap Forward, the number of people employed increased, especially after many housewives participated in productive labor. The number of children requiring enrollment increased. Although the government established many schools, they still could not accommodate everyone. At that time, there were seventy or eighty children in the Jianxiang Residents' Committee area who did not attend school. They felt as uneasy as the parents and urgently demanded a solution to this problem. Therefore, they ran around day and night, regardless of wind or rain, full of confidence, consulting with the masses. With the support of the vast number of residents, the school building problem was successfully resolved. However, when students registered, only more than 20 children of workers came. How could such a small number of students start school? The street Party branch taught them: the masses are eager to run schools, but they lack confidence in whether the new school can be run well. As long as they explain the truth to the masses, the masses will definitely send their children. They became more confident and continued to visit households, enthusiastically publicizing the Party's education policy and the rationale for running private schools, changing some people's views. When school started, there were eighty students.

When classes started, more difficulties arose. These housewives, who were taking the podium for the first time, did not know how to prepare lessons. They opened the textbooks, understood them, but couldn't teach them. They gritted their teeth and continued to teach. The forty-minute lecture time was over in twenty minutes. The children who had just entered school were not used to sitting quietly and listening to lectures, making the teachers overwhelmed and flustered. What to do? The Party branch encouraged them again, saying that everything is difficult at the beginning, and as long as you think of more ways, you will definitely be able to run the school well. They listened to the Party and vowed to learn how to teach and run private schools well. From then on, the three of them often worked until late at night, and also linked up with nearby public elementary schools, taking turns to attend classes. Afraid of distracting the students, they stood outside the window to listen. Sometimes when it rained, they held an umbrella in one hand and took notes in the other, while observing the children's expressions. The children could easily understand how the teacher was teaching. Such learning continued for a whole year without interruption. Before each class, they rehearsed according to the lesson plan. One person acted as the teacher, and the other two acted as students, until they felt that the lecture was very infectious. After two or three months of teaching and learning at the same time, they basically learned how to lecture, were able to teach according to the teaching progress, and the school's order and classroom discipline were gradually established, and the students' learning quality also improved.

Some parents who were busy with production often didn't have time to go home to cook or do housework, so the teachers cooked and steamed rice for the children, so that they could eat hot meals every meal. Wu Peifang and another teacher also bought a razor and gave the children haircuts. One child twisted his leg, and Wu Peifang carried him to class. One child had diarrhea and soiled his pants. Wu Peifang washed his buttocks and washed and dried the dirty pants. The parents were very grateful, praising them as being better than the children's own mothers, so they took the initiative to help the school and cooperate with the teachers. In the past year or so, this private elementary school has grown from two first-grade classes with eighty students to five first and second-grade classes with 213 students, meeting the enrollment requirements of the residents' children in this area.

    满足居民要求　培养优秀学生
    上海三个家庭妇女创办小学取得巨大成就
    本报讯　上海市徐汇区建襄居民委员会三个家庭妇女吴佩芳、殷祖懿、江镜容，在党的领导和群众支持下，白手起家创办了一所民办小学。由于她们教书又教人，管教又管养，学生们的学习成绩和思想品德得到了全面提高。不久前，学校举行的期终考试，试题和公办小学相同，语文优良成绩占全校学生的55.3％，算术优良成绩占82.5％，平均成绩不低于一般公办小学。几个品德不好的儿童，经过一年多的教育，都已变成诚实可爱的孩子。
    这所民办小学创办至今只有一年九个月的历史。初办时碰到了许多困难，首先她们三人文化水平都不高，缺乏教学经验，而主要教师吴佩芳，解放后才从半文盲提高到初中毕业程度。但是她们毫不动摇，看到在大跃进中就业人数增加，特别是许多家庭妇女参加生产劳动后，要求入学的儿童越来越多，尽管政府建立许多学校，还是容纳不了。当时建襄居民委员会地区就有七、八十个孩子没有上学，她们就像家长们一样感到不安，迫切的要求解决这个问题。因此，不分白天黑夜，不管刮风下雨，还是信心十足地到处奔跑，找群众商量，在广大居民支援下，校舍问题顺利地解决了，可是学生报到时，只来了工人子女二十多人。这样少的学生怎能开学呢？街道党支部教导她们：群众是迫切要求办学的，只是对新的学校能不能办好，还缺乏信心，只要向群众说明道理，群众一定会把子女送来的。她们信心更高了，继续挨家挨户去访问，满怀热情地宣传党的教育政策，宣传举办民办学校的道理，改变了一些人的看法。开学时就有了八十个学生。
    上课了，困难又来了。这些初次走上讲台的家庭妇女，不知道怎样备课，打开教科书，看得懂却教不来，硬着头皮讲下去，四十分钟的讲课时间二十分钟就讲完了，初入学校的孩子们，不习惯安静地坐着听课，弄得教师顾此失彼，手忙脚乱。怎么办？党支部又鼓励她们，凡事开头难，只要多想办法，一定能把学校办好的。她们听党的话，立志要学会教课，办好民办学校。从此，三个人常常工作到深夜，又同附近的公办小学挂钩，轮流去听课。她们怕分散学生的注意力，就站在窗外听，有时下雨了，一手撑伞，一手记笔记，一面还观察小朋友的表情，教师怎样讲，小朋友就容易领会。这样的学习，整整一年从未间断。每次上课前，她们按照教案试教，一人当教师，两人当学生，一直到认为讲得很有感染力为止。经过两、三个月这样的边教边学，基本上学会了讲课，能够按照教学进度进行教学，学校的秩序和课堂纪律逐步建立起来，学生的学习质量也有提高。
    一些生产忙的家长，经常来不及回家烧饭、做家务事，教师们就为孩子们烧饭、蒸饭，让他们每顿都吃到热腾腾的饭菜。吴佩芳和另一个教师还买了一把剃刀，替孩子们理发。有的小朋友的腿扭伤了，吴佩芳就背他去上课。有个小朋友泻肚，把大便拉在裤子上，吴佩芳替他洗屁股，又把脏裤子洗干净烘干。家长们都非常感激，称赞她们比孩子的亲娘还要好，因此主动帮助学校，与教师合作。一年多来，这所民办小学从两个一年级班级八十人，发展到现在拥有五个一、二年级班级二百一十三人，满足了这一地区居民子女的入学要求。
