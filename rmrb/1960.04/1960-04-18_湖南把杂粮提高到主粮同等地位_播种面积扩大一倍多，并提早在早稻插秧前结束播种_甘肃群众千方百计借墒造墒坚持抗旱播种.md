Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. Hunan Province, in implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing," has adopted revolutionary measures to attach equal importance to both fields and land, and to both staple and coarse grains. The province has moved the sowing of dryland coarse grain crops, which used to be done after early rice transplanting every year, to be basically completed before early rice transplanting. According to statistics on April 12, the province has sown 12,877,000 mu of coarse grain crops such as corn, sorghum, spring buckwheat, spring millet, and mung beans, which is one month to forty days earlier than last year, and the sown area has also been expanded by more than double compared to last year. The province has also planted 1,076,810,000 pumpkin seedlings and used gaps in the fields to plant 7,314,000 mu of coarse grains.

Elevating the status of dryland coarse grain crops and advancing the sowing period is a major reform in Hunan's agricultural cultivation system. In the past, the masses did not pay much attention to dryland coarse grain crops, cultivation was rough, and yields were not high. After agricultural cooperativization and people's communization, this situation gradually changed. Especially since last winter, the people's communes have made great achievements in water conservancy construction, tool reform, fertilizer accumulation, and various production preparations, opening up broad avenues for ensuring comprehensive development of production. Before sowing this year, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee summarized and promoted the experience of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in appropriately advancing the sowing period of corn, sweet potatoes, and early rice over the past two years, and required all localities to appropriately advance the season for spring-sown crops and to grasp dryland crops in the same way as rice. It is necessary to achieve early plowing, early fertilization, and early sowing, so that the sowing of dryland crops can catch up before the transplanting of early rice.

Party committees at all levels, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, consulted with the masses, summarized the typical experiences of attaching importance to coarse grain production over the years, and used the yield comparison between early and late sowing to carry out mass discussions. On the basis of unified thinking and understanding, in early February, the province launched a vigorous mass movement for spring plowing and spring sowing of coarse grain crops. Now, the sowing work has been basically completed, with neat and tidy seedlings emerging from every plot, and strong and tall seedlings from every plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. A surging spring plowing and sowing high tide has been comprehensively formed in Gansu Province. In the face of the spring drought, the province has mobilized 1.4 million laborers and 880,000 head of livestock, in the spirit of making full use of every drop of water and seizing every second, to try every means to seize, create, and borrow soil moisture for crash spring sowing. As of early April, the province has sown 14,520,000 mu of summer and autumn harvest crops, with an average daily progress of more than 400,000 mu, which is 39% faster than the same period last year. The quality of spring sowing is also very good. According to inspections in 19 counties and cities, among the 3,760,000 mu of summer and autumn crops that have been sown, the first-class fields with good soil moisture and sufficient fertilizer and careful cultivation account for 90%, the second-class fields account for 8%, and the third-class fields account for only 2%.

On the basis of early, fast, plentiful, and good spring sowing preparations, in order to seize soil moisture and overcome the spring drought, all localities have generally started plowing and sowing ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. The Dingxi Special District has ranked the soil moisture, and generally carried out soil crushing and harrowing to preserve soil moisture for first-class and second-class soil moisture; for third-class moisture-deficient land and some compacted land, it has carried out fine crushing and harrowing, adopting methods such as first planting the sunny slopes, then the shady slopes, first the river valleys, then the mountains, first the sandy soil, then the loamy soil; sowing the sunny slopes early, the shady slopes at noon, and the plains in the evening, etc., to seize soil moisture and sow in a timely manner. After a snowfall, Huicheng County mobilized more than 69,000 people and more than 27,000 head of livestock to crash-sow 66,463 mu of summer and autumn crops. Jingyuan, Lintao and other five counties and cities, fifteen people's communes have already completed the spring sowing task ahead of schedule.

In drought-resistant sowing, the people's communes in various places, based on the principles of equal value exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, carried out communist-style large-scale collaboration between mountain areas and river valley areas, and between early-sowing areas and late-sowing areas, accelerated the progress of seizing soil moisture for sowing, and fully demonstrated the power of the people's communes. For example, the Datan Commune in Xili County, according to the principle of "exchanging labor for labor, exchanging mu for mu, compensating for the difference, and collaborating between mountains and rivers," signed "five guarantees" collaborative contracts with ten production teams, guaranteeing cultivation, sowing, quality, yield, and seedlings, and successfully completed the potato sowing task in only four days, which was seventeen days faster than in previous years.

    湖南把杂粮提高到主粮同等地位
    播种面积扩大一倍多，并提早在早稻插秧前结束播种
    甘肃群众千方百计借墒造墒坚持抗旱播种
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省在贯彻“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针中，采取革命的措施，做到田土并重，主粮杂粮并举，把每年都在早稻插秧以后才动手的旱土杂粮作物播种工作，提早在早稻插秧前基本播种完毕。据4月12日统计，全省已播种玉米、高粱、春荞、春粟、绿豆等杂粮作物一千二百八十七万亩，比去年提早一个月到四十天，播种面积也比去年扩大了一倍多。全省还种南瓜十亿七千六百八十一万蔸，利用空隙地种杂粮七百三十一万四千亩。
    提高旱土杂粮作物的地位和提早播种期，是湖南农业耕作制度上的一项重大改革。过去，群众对旱土杂粮作物不大重视，耕作粗糙，产量不高。农业合作化和人民公社化以后，这个情况就逐步改变，特别是去冬以来，人民公社在兴修水利、工具改革、积肥和各项生产准备上，都做出了巨大成绩，为保证生产的全面发展开辟了广阔的道路。今年播种前，中共湖南省委总结和推广了湘西土家族苗族自治州两年来适当提早玉米、红薯、早稻播种期的经验，要求各地适当提早春播作物季节，并要像抓水稻一样抓旱土作物。做到早翻土、早施肥、早播种，使旱土作物的播种赶在早稻插秧的前面。
    各级党委根据省委的指示，和群众共同商量，总结历年来重视杂粮生产的典型经验，用早播与迟播的产量作对比，开展了群众性大讨论。在统一思想认识的基础上，2月上旬，全省就掀起了声势浩大的春耕春播杂粮作物的群众运动。现在，播种工作基本结束，旱土杂粮作物丘丘出苗整齐，蔸蔸苗高秆壮。
    据新华社兰州讯　热浪滚滚的春耕播种高潮，已在甘肃省全面形成。在春旱面前，全省出动一百四十万劳动力和八十八万头壮畜，本着滴水必用、分秒必争的精神，千方百计抢墒、造墒、借墒，突击春播。截至4月初，全省已播种夏收和秋收作物一千四百五十二万亩，平均日进度四十多万亩，比去年同期快39％。春播质量也很好。据十九个县市的检查，已经播种的三百七十六万亩夏秋作物中，墒好肥足、耕作精细的一类田占90％，二类田占8％，三类田仅占2％。
    在春播准备早、快、多、好的基础上，为了抢墒播种，战胜春旱，各地普遍比往年提早十天到半月开犁下种。定西专区对地墒进行了排队，对一类墒、二类墒普遍进行了碎土、耙耱保墒；对三类欠墒地和一部分板结地，进行细打细耱，采取先阳山后阴山，先川地，后山地，先沙质地，后土质地；早种阳山，午种阴山，晚种平川等办法，抢墒适时播种。徽成县在一次降雪后，出动六万九千多人、牲畜二万七千多头，突击种好了六万六千四百六十三亩夏秋作物。靖远、临洮等五个县、市，已有十五个人民公社提前胜利完成了春播任务。
    在抗旱播种中，各地人民公社根据等价交换互助互利的原则，开展了山区和川区、早播地区和晚播地区的共产主义大协作，加快了抢墒播种的进度，充分显示了人民公社的威力。如西礼县大滩公社根据
  “以工换工，以亩顶亩，照补差额，山川协作”的原则，在十个生产队签订了保耕、保种、保质、保出、保苗的“五保”协作合同，只四天时间就胜利完成马铃薯的播种任务，比往年快十七天。
