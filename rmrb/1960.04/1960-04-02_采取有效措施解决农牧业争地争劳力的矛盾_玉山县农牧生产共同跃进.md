    Taking Effective Measures to Resolve Conflicts Over Land and Labor Between Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    Yushan County Achieves Joint Leap Forward in Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production
    (Reported by this newspaper) On the basis of achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry last year, Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, is further applying the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence and mutual promotion between the two industries to better promote the double leap forward in agriculture and animal husbandry.
    When discussing this year's leap forward plan for agriculture and animal husbandry, a few people in Yushan County believed that since agriculture and animal husbandry had a comprehensive bumper harvest last year, if both industries were to continue to develop greatly this year, there would be difficult-to-solve problems such as competition for land and labor. Therefore, only one of the two industries could continue to develop greatly this year. After analysis, everyone unanimously affirmed that both agriculture and animal husbandry should continue to develop greatly this year. As for the problem of mutual competition for land and labor, it can be completely solved as long as we actively think of solutions.
    In accordance with the spirit of taking grain as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, Yushan County's agricultural and animal husbandry leap forward plan for this year first requires a 40% increase in total grain output, a doubling of total cotton output, and a 20% increase in total oil crop output. In this way, vigorously developing agriculture will provide more feed and funds for the development of animal husbandry. According to the agricultural development plan, it is also required to vigorously develop animal husbandry to provide more fertilizer for agriculture. This year, it was decided to raise 700,000 pigs, double the number from last year, and achieve two pigs per mu of field, a 20% increase in draught cattle, a doubling of poultry, and corresponding development of other sheep, rabbits, etc.
    Three measures were taken to solve the problem of competition for land between agriculture and animal husbandry. First, the area of early rice was expanded from 220,000 mu to 230,000 mu, the area of cash crops was expanded by 18,000 mu compared with last year, and the area of feed land was increased from 30,000 mu to 50,000 mu. The method of expanding feed land is to reclaim part of the wasteland, allocate part of the low-yield dry land from agriculture, and utilize all scattered land. Since this spring, the county has reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland. Second, achieve high yield of feed and save the use of feed land. First, select high-yield feed crops, such as banana lotus root, sweet potato, Swiss chard, radish, etc. Third, widely use the rich wild feed in mountainous areas and make a large amount of silage. Strive to achieve 100,000 silage cellars in the county this summer, with an average of 4,000 per commune.
    In order to solve the problem of mutual competition for labor between agriculture and animal husbandry, Yushan County has taken these main measures: First, the county party committee and the party committees of each commune have established pig raising technology innovation committees at all levels, with technical personnel and iron and woodworking workers participating, and the first secretary personally took command to lead the development of pig raising technology innovation. First of all, innovate the most labor-intensive and inefficient cutting tools to realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of cutting. Last year and this spring, five kinds of advanced cutting tools such as grass cutters, slicers, shredders, grinders, and crushers have been successfully created, and the work efficiency is five to ten times higher than that of manual cutting in the past; At present, a large number of iron and woodworking workers are rushing to manufacture, and strive to promote 5,000 various cutting machines throughout the county this year, reaching an average of 200 per commune. Second, realize the vehicle transportation of feed and fertilizer. Each commune is widely using old wood to manufacture native vehicles, and at the same time, repair and utilize the native vehicles, native trains, and wooden tracks left over from water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. Third, realize the self-flowing water for pig raising. Each pig farm uses moso bamboo to make water pipes, uses a mixture of soil to build ditches, and introduces water into the farm, saving a large amount of labor spent on carrying and lifting water in the past. Fourth, arrange and use labor reasonably and flexibly. Determine that 80% of the labor force will engage in agriculture throughout the year, 5% of the labor force will engage in animal husbandry, and flexibly adjust according to the busy and slack seasons of agricultural affairs and the development needs of various industries, thereby smoothly solving the problem of mutual competition for labor between agriculture and animal husbandry.

### 采取有效措施解决农牧业争地争劳力的矛盾  玉山县农牧生产共同跃进

    采取有效措施解决农牧业争地争劳力的矛盾
    玉山县农牧生产共同跃进
    本报讯　江西玉山县在取得去年农牧业全面大丰收的基础上，进一步运用两业互相依存、互相促进的辩证关系，更好地促进农牧业双双跃进。
    玉山县在讨论今年农牧业的跃进规划时，少数人认为去年农牧业全面丰收了，今年农牧业还要继续共同大发展，就要发生难以解决的争地争劳力等问题，因此，今年只能使两业中的一业继续大发展。大家经过分析后一致肯定今年农牧两业都要继续大发展。至于发生相互争地争劳力的问题，只要积极想办法，也是完全可以解决的。
    根据以粮为纲、全面跃进的精神，玉山县今年农牧业跃进规划首先要求粮食总产量增长40％，棉花总产量翻一番，油料总产量增长20％。这样，大力发展农业，就为发展牧业提供了更多的饲料和资金。根据农业发展规划又要求大力发展牧业，为农业提供更多的肥料。今年决定养猪七十万头，比去年翻一番，实现亩田二头猪，耕牛增加20％，家禽增加一倍，其他羊、兔等也有相应发展。
    对农牧业争地的问题，采取三条措施加以解决。第一，早稻面积由二十二万亩扩大到二十三万亩，经济作物比去年扩大一万八千亩，饲料地由三万亩增加到五万亩。扩大饲料地的办法是开垦一部分荒地，从农业上拨出一部分低产旱地，利用一切零星地。今春以来，全县已开垦荒地一万多亩。第二，实现饲料高产化，节约使用饲料地。首先选种高产饲料作物，如蕉藕、红薯、莙达菜、萝卜等。第三，广泛运用山区丰富的野生饲料，大量青贮。争取今年夏季全县达到十万个青贮窖，平均每个公社有四千个。
    为了解决农牧业互相争劳力的问题，玉山县采取了这些主要措施：一、县委和各公社党委层层建立了有技术人员和铁木工人参加的养猪技术革新委员会，第一书记亲自挂帅，领导开展养猪技术革新。首先革新花费劳力最多、效率又低的切料工具，实现切料半机械化、机械化。去年和今春已创制成功铡草机、切片机、刨丝机、磨粉机、粉碎机等五种先进切料工具，工效比过去人工切料提高五倍至十倍；目前大批铁木工人正在赶制赶造，力争今年全县推广各种切料机五千部，达到平均每个公社有二百部。二、实现运送饲料和肥料车子化。各社正在广泛利用旧木料制造土车子，同时把去冬今春兴修水利遗留下来的土车子、土火车、木轨道等加以整修利用。三、实现养猪用水自流化。各个养猪场运用毛竹做水管，用三合土砌水沟，引水进场，节省过去挑水、抬水花费的大批劳力。四、合理安排、灵活使用劳力。确定全年80％的劳力搞农业，以5％的劳力搞牧业，并随农事季节忙闲和各业发展需要灵活调动，从而顺利解决了农牧业互相争劳力的问题。
