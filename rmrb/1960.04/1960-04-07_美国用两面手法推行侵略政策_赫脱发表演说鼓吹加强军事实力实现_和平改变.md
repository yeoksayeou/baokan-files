Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch from Chicago: U.S. Secretary of State Herter delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the National Association of Broadcasters in Chicago on the 4th, elaborating on the "main trends" and "future tasks" of U.S. foreign policy. In this speech, Herter emphasized that in order to achieve the goals of U.S. policy in today's world, the United States must solve "the problem of peaceful change." He said, "We must prevent the use of military force to achieve change, and try to achieve the changes needed in a peaceful way."

Herter then listed five "important ways" that the United States is taking to achieve "peaceful change": First, strengthening the military aggression system headed by the United States; Second, striving to reach disarmament agreements according to U.S. terms; Third, negotiating with the Soviet Union to maintain the West German hotbed of war and the Western position in West Berlin; Fourth, stepping up the use of economic assistance to control the political and economic development of underdeveloped countries; Fifth, using organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States to cover up and promote the aggressive war policies of the United States. Among the above five important ways, what Herter emphasized first is the way to strengthen the military strength of the United States and its allies, which clearly shows what the meaning of "peaceful change" advocated by Herter is. In his speech, Herter boasted about the consistent use of force policy by the United States and the many measures taken by the United States in the past year to strengthen the military aggression system. He said, "Recent steps have consolidated and strengthened the defensive forces of the free world. These steps include the signing of a new security treaty between the United States and Japan, improved coordination and cooperation within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, and the strengthening of the Pan-American system through the foreign ministers' meeting held in Santiago."

Herter emphasized that in the United States' so-called "collective security system," the "first fortress" is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This organization and other military treaty organizations arranged by the United States "will remain the cornerstone of our country's policy in the years to come, as in the past." He said that the military force at the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's existence "is still indispensable to the West's negotiating position." He also said that now, the "military strength is continuing to grow" of the North Atlantic group, the rearmament of West Germany "is proceeding satisfactorily," some Western European countries have decided or are planning to increase their military budgets, US and British troops continue to "remain stationed on the European continent," and in addition, "great progress has been made" in equipping the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces with "modernized weapons." But Herter said that although progress has been great, "the land, sea, and air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization still need to be further strengthened," and "the United States will continue to advance with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to achieve military and non-military goals."

When talking about disarmament negotiations, Herter made it clear that the United States is trying to implement "disarmament" within the scope required by the United States. He once again emphasized that the United States is seeking so-called "guaranteed arms supervision." He insisted that the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is a "general, vague provision," while the plan proposed by the United States at the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, which is disarmament in name but expansion of armaments in reality, is a "practical approach." Herter said, "In the long run, Western countries hope to gradually make the world accept a more complete set of international laws and institutions to enforce such international laws. Within this scope, it will be possible to carry out more general disarmament."

Herter said that the United States also wants to "try to negotiate with the Soviet Union" on political disputes "to reduce the risk of war." In this regard, he said that "one of the main problems facing us today is the division of Germany." But like the disarmament issue, he also made it clear in negotiating the settlement of the German issue that the United States will adhere to its existing stubborn policy. Herter said that on the German issue, the United States still believes that reunification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany should be achieved on the basis of a so-called "free plebiscite." Herter tried his best to praise Adenauer, saying that West Germany under Adenauer's leadership has made "effective contributions" to the security of the Western world. He also said that at the East-West summit meeting to be held next month, the West will continue to "take a firm stand" on the West Berlin issue and "demonstrate the free world's determination to maintain basic rights."

Herter also emphasized that the United States must promote "peaceful change" in underdeveloped areas. He said that the strengthening of these areas is "of vital interest" to the United States. He demanded that "assistance" be used as a bait to win over Asian, African, and Latin American countries where national independence movements are booming, clamoring that these countries must "grow up in freedom" and get rid of the influence of socialist countries. He advocated establishing "bridges of understanding" with emerging countries through methods such as "goodwill visits," while demanding the establishment of regional military organizations in these areas.

Herter made it clear that while pursuing its aggressive foreign policy, the United States is using the United Nations, the Organization of American

    美国用两面手法推行侵略政策
    赫脱发表演说鼓吹加强军事实力实现“和平改变”
    新华社6日讯　芝加哥消息：美国国务卿赫脱4日在芝加哥全国广播工作者协会年会上发表一篇演说，阐述美国外交政策的“主要趋势”和“今后的任务”。赫脱在这篇演说中强调说，为了在今天的世界上实现美国政策的目标，美国必须解决“和平的改变的问题”他说，“我们必须防止使用军事力量来实现改变，而设法以和平的方式来实现所需要的改变”。
    赫脱接着列举了美国为实现“和平改变”而正在采取的五种“重要方式”，这就是：一、加强以美国为首的军事侵略体系；二、争取按照美国的条件达成裁军协议；三、同苏联进行谈判，以求保持西德战争温床和西方在西柏林地位；四、加紧用经济援助来控制不发达国家的政治、经济发展；五、利用联合国组织和美洲国家组织等机构掩护和推行美国的侵略战争政策。在上述五种重要方式中，赫脱首先强调的是加强美国和它盟国的军事实力的方式，这清楚地表明了，赫脱所鼓吹的“和平改变”的含义究竟是什么。赫脱在讲演中夸耀美国的一贯使用的武力政策和美国在近一年来采取的加强军事侵略体系的许多措施，他说，“最近的一些步骤已经巩固和加强了自由世界的防御力量，这些步骤包括美国和日本签署了一个新的安全条约，东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织内部改进了统筹工作和合作以及通过在圣地亚哥举行的外长会议加强了泛美体系。”
    赫脱强调说，在美国的所谓“集体安全体系中”、“第一个堡垒”是北大西洋公约组织。这个组织和美国安排的其他军事条约组织，“在今后的年代里像在过去一样，将仍然是我们国家的政策的基石。”他说，作为北大西洋公约组织存在核心的军事力量“对西方的谈判地位仍然是不可少的”。他还说，现在，北大西洋集团的“军事力量正在继续增长”，西德的重新武装“令人满意地在进行着”，一些西欧国家已经决定或者正在计划增加它们的军事预算，美英部队继续“留驻欧洲大陆”，此外，在用“现代化武器”装备北大西洋公约组织部队方面也“取得了很大的进展”。但是赫脱说，虽然进展一直很大，“北大西洋公约组织的陆、海、空部队仍然需要进一步加强”，“美国将继续同它的北大西洋公约组织盟国一同前进来实现军事和非军事的目标”。
    在谈到裁军问题谈判时，赫脱表明美国力图在美国要求的范围内来实行“裁军”。他再一次强调美国谋求所谓“有保障的军备监督”。他硬说苏联的全面和彻底的裁军建议是“泛泛的、含糊的规定”，而美国在日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议上提出的裁军其名、扩军其实的计划是“切实可行的做法”。赫脱说，“从长远说来，西方国家希望逐步使全世界接受一套比较充分的国际法以及执行这种国际法的机构。在这个范围内，就将有可能进行比较普遍的裁军。”
    赫脱说，美国也要就政治争端“设法同苏联谈判”，“以减少战争的危险”。在这方面，他说今天“面临的主要问题之一是德国的分裂问题”。但是和裁军问题一样，他在谈判解决德国问题上也表明美国将坚持现有的顽固政策。赫脱说，在德国问题上，美国仍然认为应该在所谓“自由的公民投票的基础上”实现重新统一和缔结对德和约。赫脱竭力替阿登纳吹捧，说西德在阿登纳领导下对西方世界的安全作出了“有效的贡献”。他还说，在下月举行的东西方最高级会议上，西方将继续在西柏林问题上“采取坚定态度”，并且“表明自由世界维护主要的权利的决心”。
    赫脱还强调美国必须促进不发达地区的“和平的改变”。他说，这些地区的壮大对美国是“有切身利害关系的”。他要求用“援助”为诱饵来拉拢民族独立运动蓬勃发展的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家，叫嚷必须使这些国家“在自由中成长”，摆脱社会主义国家的影响。他鼓吹通过诸如“亲善访问”等办法同新兴国家建立起“谅解的桥梁”，同时要求在这些地区建立起区域性的军事组织。
    赫脱表明，美国在推行它的侵略性外交政策的同时，正在利用联合国、美洲国家组织和科伦坡计划等作为它的工具。他在这方面特别热中于要求建立“联合国警察部队”。他说，在联合国大会下届会议上，美国将就派出联合国警察部队或联合国其他人员的措施进行磋商。赫脱最后谈到了美国外交政策的“前途”。他说，他“并不夸口说美国在对外政策的这一切方面的做法一定是完善的”，因为“巨大的障碍仍然存在”。他再一次叫嚷美国在追逐它的侵略目标时要依靠强大的实力，他说，美国必须拥有同它的政策目标相适应的军事和经济实力，他说，“结果如何，将取决于自由世界的力量和团结。”
