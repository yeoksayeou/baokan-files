Committee Member Sheng Pihua's Speech

Chairman, esteemed delegates, esteemed committee members:

I am无比兴奋(wúbǐ xīngfèn)to have heard and studied the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the draft national economic plan and the draft state budget for the year 1959 national accounts and 1960. Our country's socialist construction can, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, develop rapidly, better year by year, at a sustained Great Leap Forward speed. This is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great victory of mass movements under the leadership of the Party; entirely the great victory of the general line of building socialism, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes; in general, entirely the great victory of the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, Mao Zedong Thought.

Facing the Leap Forward Situation, Industrialists and Businessmen Must Strengthen Political Study and Worldview Transformation

Since the people of the whole country studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and universally launched the anti-rightist, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy movement, the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement is in full swing, with an earth-shattering momentum, on a scale even grander than the Great Leap Forward in steel production, with one climax after another constantly unfolding. Vice Premier Li Fuchun instructed: "The technical innovation and technical revolution movement should be combined with the movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works, which is being widely carried out throughout the country, so that the movement has the guidance of correct thought." I realized that the reason why the broad masses of working people can liberate their minds, give full play to the soaring enthusiasm of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and constantly achieve great achievements in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, is because they are inspired and encouraged by Chairman Mao's thought, and because the Party's political and ideological education has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. Where the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is carried out well, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement must also be carried out well. Countless facts have proved a truth, that is: no matter what you do, you must put politics in command and let ideology go first. Many examples in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement illustrate the importance of political theory study and ideological education work. For us industrialists and businessmen, facing the current situation, strengthening political theory study and strengthening the transformation of political stand and worldview is of particularly great significance.

More than a month ago, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a national congress. This congress was conducted under the leadership and care of the Party. Due to being inspired by Chairman Mao's thought, the congress broke through the past conventions and adopted the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses"; it was not like the past from top to bottom, but first from bottom to top, and then from top to bottom. The congress itself did not first put forward any issues, but let the two thousand delegates and observers raise the issues themselves, discuss the issues themselves, analyze the issues themselves, and solve the issues themselves. Of course, the opinions of two thousand people are scattered, and most of them are piecemeal, but after group discussions, small group discussions, and even three-to-five-person talks, mutual inspiration, and mutual help, these scattered, piecemeal opinions gradually changed from different to similar, from similar to concentrated, and then from small concentration to large concentration. Finally, the presidium summarized the concentrated opinions, made a comprehensive analysis, and drew conclusions, becoming the collective creation of the two thousand representatives in their own language. This is entirely the result of being inspired by Chairman Mao's thought, it is both democratic and centralized. All the delegates received an extremely profound and extremely pleasant education from this meeting, and greatly advanced the idea of self-education and self-transformation. We have basically reached a consensus, that is: we have made great progress, but we still need to transform ourselves. As for the ways for us to continue to transform ourselves, that is the two-pronged approach of actively participating in labor practice (including production, work, and social activities) and strengthening political theory study, so as to strengthen the fundamental transformation of political stand and worldview.

Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works are class-based, they are proletarian science and serve the proletariat. From the perspective of class essence, it is difficult for us industrialists and businessmen to accept proletarian political theory. However, under the specific conditions of China, after the bourgeoisie as a class is eliminated, for the majority of bourgeois elements, it is possible to gradually recognize the correctness of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought through labor practice and political study. Therefore, on the basis of the achievements we have already made in self-transformation, in order to further strengthen the fundamental transformation of breaking the capitalist ideology and establishing the socialist ideology in terms of political stand and worldview, so as to better play a positive role and make due contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland, we must, in the future, while actively participating in labor practice, strive to study political theory. This shows that it is not only possible but also absolutely necessary for us to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works.

In the past, we industrialists and businessmen generally lacked interest in political theory study, and lacked a correct understanding of the relationship between political theory study and self-transformation. In the past, we industrialists and businessmen focused on so-called "experience" to guide our work and life. This so-called "experience" is mainly the old stuff of capitalism, which is essentially the bourgeois stand, and it is precisely what we must eliminate in our self-transformation. We study political theory precisely to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work and life, replacing our past so-called "experience." The "experience" we are talking about here is the old, capitalist, bad "experience," not all experience. We must correctly recognize that studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works is for breaking the capitalist ideology and establishing the socialist ideology. If we do not go through the fierce struggle of breaking the capitalist ideology and establishing the socialist ideology in our thinking, we cannot have any gains.

Since Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works are proletarian science, in order for us industrialists and businessmen to have good gains in learning, we must put ourselves in the opposite position, that is, it is easier to understand everything by standing on the socialist and proletarian position to observe everything. If we stand still, using old experience and old perspectives to observe everything, the result will inevitably be that we cannot learn, are not interested, cannot adapt to objective reality, and even run counter to the times. Therefore, the process of political theory study must be the process of class struggle in our thinking. In order for political theory study to truly help us transform ourselves, correct our stand, and improve our understanding, we must have the confidence, determination, and perseverance to continue learning, gradually develop an interest in learning and the habit of learning, and achieve the unity of theory and practice, the consistency of words and deeds, and truly use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all our work and thinking.

Considering the interests of the country and the people and leaning towards socialism is the only way for industrialists and businessmen to carry out self-transformation at the present stage.

According to the situation in the past year or two, in the general trend, more and more of us industrialists and businessmen have greatly promoted political and ideological transformation and increased enthusiasm in service due to political theory study. Through studying in socialist colleges and political schools, most industrialists and businessmen have made significant progress, not only have their living habits and work styles changed to varying degrees, and they have also made better achievements in service, but they can also further rely on the Party and the working masses. Taking recent facts as an example, after studying in the two-congresses representative meeting for more than a month, most of the Shanghai industrialists and businessmen have significantly increased their enthusiasm when they return to their enterprise posts. Many technicians have actively thrown themselves into the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, put forward many valuable rationalization proposals, and made some achievements. Some private managers of professional companies used to think that they were insignificant in the enterprise, but now they also realize the importance of their work posts, take the initiative to step out of the manager's office, go deep into the departments and integrate with the working masses, and some people have already made certain achievements. These facts fully demonstrate the significant role of political ideology in production and labor and the importance of strengthening political and ideological transformation for us industrialists and businessmen.

Personally, when I returned to Shanghai after this two-congresses representative meeting, I also discussed such a question in the self-study mutual aid group on the Party's teaching that we should study historical materialism (the self-study mutual aid group is a permanent group for several comrades of Shanghai municipal-level industrialists and businessmen to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works): Some people mentioned that studying historical materialism is to understand the laws of social development. We know that the objective law of historical development is that capitalism is bound to perish and socialism is bound to prosper, but why is it inevitable, and what is the reason for inevitability? At that time, everyone paused for a while, and after discussion, they understood that this is because the development of productive forces must promote the reform of production relations, and production relations must conform to the development of productive forces. But going a step further, some things are not clear. This time, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report that "the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in productive forces" and also said that "in order to continuously give play to the enthusiasm of the people, following the principle of Marxism-Leninism on continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development as expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong, we constantly and rationally solve the contradictions between production relations and productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, the continuous reform of production relations and the superstructure opens up broad avenues for the continuous development of productive forces. And the continuous development of productive forces, in turn, forces the continuous reform of production relations and the superstructure." Vice Premier Li's passage helped us to further understand the issue of understanding the laws of social development. Not only did we initially understand the reasons for the two inevitabilities, but we also understood that the proletariat must not only understand the world but also transform the world. Only by correctly understanding the world and mastering its laws of change can subjective initiative be fully utilized, making the possible become reality. For example, we also have the same experience with our self-transformation. After studying Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, we understand that our self-transformation is also a process of continuous revolution, which will never stop. At the same time, our transformation has different contents in different periods, that is, different stages. For our current stage, it is to combine production and labor practice, and transform our political stand and worldview through the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. During our two-congresses representative meeting, the Party instructed us to be determined to "lean to one side," to lean to the side of the interests of the country and the people, and to "fall to one side," to fall to the side of socialism. This is the only way for us to transform ourselves at the present stage.

Under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, with the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, the upsurge of cultural construction in our country is also unfolding widely throughout the country with a magnificent, galloping momentum. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on us in its work report to universally hold socialist colleges, political schools, industrial and commercial training classes, and other full-time study and various spare-time study in various forms, and to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works and historical materialism. Our Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce will certainly respond to the call of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, promote members to further actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution under the unified leadership of the Party committee, combine production and labor practice, set off an upsurge of political theory study of studying Chairman Mao's works and historical materialism, and further strengthen the transformation of political stand and worldview, so as to adapt to the great situation of the motherland's leaping development and march forward together with the people of the whole country, holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 工商业者要“顾一头”、“一边倒  盛丕华委员的发言

专栏：

    工商业者要“顾一头”、“一边倒
    盛丕华委员的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我以无比兴奋的心情，听到和学习了李富春副总理和李先念副总理的关于国民经济计划草案和1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。我国社会主义建设能够在1958年大跃进的基础上，以持续的大跃进的速度，一年比一年更好地迅速发展，这完全是中国共产党的正确领导和党领导下大搞群众运动的伟大的胜利；完全是建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利；总的说来，完全是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    面对跃进形势，工商业者要加强政治学习和世界观的改造
    自从全国人民学习党的八届八中全会的文件，普遍开展反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约运动以来，全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动正在以热火朝天、移山倒海的形势，比大炼钢铁更为宏大的规模，一个高潮接一个高潮地不断开展。李富春副总理指示说：“技术革新和技术革命运动应当同目前在全国各地广泛开展的学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，使运动有正确思想的指导。”我体会到广大劳动人民所以能够解放思想，发挥敢想敢说敢做的冲天干劲，在技术革新、技术革命运动中不断地取得伟大成就，就是由于受到毛主席思想的启发和鼓舞，由于党的政治思想教育深入人心。那里学习毛主席著作的运动开展得好，技术革新、技术革命运动也一定开展得好。无数事实证明了一条真理，这就是：不论做什么事情，都必须政治挂帅、思想先行。当前技术革新、技术革命运动中许多事例，都说明了政治理论学习和思想教育工作的重要性。对于我们工商业者来说，面对当前形势，加强政治理论学习、加强政治立场和世界观的改造，更具有特别重大的意义。
    在一个多月以前，中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会举行了一次全国代表大会。这次代表大会是在党的领导和关怀下进行的。由于受到了毛主席思想启发，大会突破了过去的常规，采取了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线；不是像过去那样的由上而下，而是先由下而上、再由上而下。大会本身，不先提出任何问题，由二千位出列席代表自己来提出问题，自己来讨论问题，自己来分析问题，自己来解决问题。当然二千人的意见是分散的，大部分是一点一滴的，但是经过小组、小小组，以至三三五五的谈话、互相启发、互相帮助，这些分散的、一点一滴的意见，就逐步由不同到接近，由接近到集中，再由小的集中到大的集中。最后由主席团把集中起来的意见，归纳为几个问题，加以综合分析，作出结论，成为二千个代表的自己语言，成为二千个代表的集体的创作。这完全是受到毛主席思想启发的结果，既是民主，也是集中。全体代表从这次会议中受到极其深刻而又极其愉快的一次教育，把自我教育、自我改造的思想大大地推进了一步。我们在基本上得到了一致的认识，这就是：大有进步，还要改造。至于我们继续改造的途径，那就是积极参加劳动实践（包括生产、工作和社会活动）与加强政治理论学习结合起来的两条腿走路方针，用以加强政治立场和世界观的根本改造。
    马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作是具有阶级性的，是无产阶级的科学而为无产阶级服务的。我们工商业者从阶级本质来说，是很难接受无产阶级政治理论的。但是在中国的具体条件下，资产阶级作为一个阶级被消灭之后，对于多数资产阶级分子来说，是可以通过劳动实践和政治学习逐步认识到马克思列宁主义和毛主席思想的正确性的。因此我们在自我改造已经取得的成就基础上，为了在政治立场和世界观方面进一步加强破资立社的根本改造，从而更好地发挥积极作用，为祖国社会主义建设做出应有的贡献，今后就必须在积极参加劳动实践的同时，努力学习政治理论。这就说明了现在我们学习马克思列宁主义，首先是毛主席著作，不仅是可能，而且是完全必要。
    过去，我们工商业者一般对于政治理论学习，缺乏兴趣，对政治理论学习和自我改造关系更缺乏正确的认识。我们工商业者过去偏重于所谓“经验”，以此来指导我们工作和生活，这一种所谓“经验”，主要是资本主义的一套旧东西，实质上就是资产阶级立场，也正是我们要在自我改造中所必须破除掉的东西。我们学习政治理论，正是为了用马克思列宁主义、毛主席思想来指导我们工作和生活，替代我们过去所谓“经验”。我们这里所说的“经验”是旧的资本主义的一套不好的“经验”不是指一切经验。我们必须正确认识，学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，是为了破资立社，如果在思想上不经过破资立社的激烈斗争，就不可能有什么收获。
    由于马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作是无产阶级的科学，我们工商业者要学得有好的收获，就必须把自己站到对面地位去，也就是站在社会主义立场，无产阶级立场来观察一切事物就比较容易理解。如果我们站在原地方不动，用旧经验、老眼光来观察一切事物，那末其结果必然是学不进去，不感兴趣，不能适应客观实际，甚至和时代背道而驰。所以，政治理论学习的过程，必然是我们思想上阶级斗争的过程，为了政治理论学习真正有助于我们改造自己，端正立场，提高认识，我们必须要有信心有决心有恒心地学下去，逐步养成学习的兴趣和学习的习惯，做到理论与实际结合，言与行的一致，真正用马克思列宁主义和毛主席思想作为我们一切工作和思想的指导。
    顾国家和人民的利益，倒向社会主义，是工商业者目前阶段进行自我改造的唯一途径
    根据最近一二年的情况来说，在总的趋势上，我们工商业者有越来越多的人，由于经过政治理论学习，大大地推动了政治思想改造和在服务中积极性的提高。经过社会主义学院、政治学校的学习，多数工商业者都有显著的进步，不仅在生活习惯和工作作风上有了不同程度的改变，在服务中也作出了较好的成绩，而且能够进一步依靠党和依靠职工群众。以最近事实来说，我们上海工商业者经过一个多月两会代表大会中的学习，在回到企业岗位时多数人积极性有了显著的提高。许多技术人员，积极地投身到技术革新和技术革命的运动中去，提出了不少有价值的合理化建议，作出了一些成绩，有些专业公司的私方经理，过去认为自己在企业中无足轻重，现在也认识到自己工作岗位的重要，主动地走出经理室，深入科室与职工群众打成一片，有些人已经作出了一定成绩。这些事实充分说明了政治思想对于生产劳动的重大作用和我们工商业者加强政治思想改造的重要性。
    就我个人来说，也在这一次两会代表大会后回到上海时，对党教导我们要学习历史唯物主义，在自习互助组中讨论了这样一个问题（自学互助组是我们上海市级工商业者几个同志学习马列主义和毛主席著作一个常设小组）：有人提到学习历史唯物主义是为了认识社会发展规律，我们知道历史发展的客观规律是资本主义必然灭亡、社会主义必然兴盛，但是为什么是必然，必然的道理是什么？当时大家停了一回，经过讨论，才理解到这是因为生产力的发展，一定要促进生产关系的改革，生产关系必须要符合生产力的发展。但是深入一步就有些讲不清楚。这一次李富春副总理在报告中说“人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素”又说“为了不断地发挥人民群众的积极性、遵循毛泽东同志所阐明的马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，我们不断地合理地解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾。根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革。”李副总理这一段话使我们对认识社会发展规律问题进一步得到了理解。不仅初步懂得了两个必然的道理，而且也懂得了无产阶级不仅要认识世界，而且还要改造世界，只有在正确地认识世界，并且掌握了它的变化规律后，主观能动性才能得到充分的发挥，使可能变为现实。又如对于我们工商业者自我改造也有同样体会，从学习了毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论后，明白了我们自我改造也是一个不断革命的过程，永远不会停止，同时在不同时期我们的改造有不同的内容，也就是不同阶段。就我们目前阶段来说就是结合生产劳动实践，通过对马克思列宁主义毛主席著作的学习，来改造政治立场和世界观。在我们两会代表大会时期，党指示我们，要下决心“顾一头”要顾国家和人民利益的一头，“一边倒”倒向社会主义一边。这就是我们在目前阶段自我改造的唯一途径。
    在毛主席思想光辉照耀下，随着经济建设高潮的到来，我国文化建设高潮也正以波澜壮阔、万马奔腾的形势在全国范围内广泛地开展起来。政协全国委员会在工作报告中号召我们以多种多样形式，普遍举办社会主义学院、政治学校、工商界讲习班等脱产学习和各种业余学习，加强学习毛主席著作和历史唯物主义。我们上海市民建会和工商联一定响应政协全国委员会号召推动成员在党委的统一领导下进一步积极参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，结合生产劳动实践，掀起学习毛主席著作、学习历史唯物主义的政治理论学习的高潮，进一步加强政治立场和世界观的改造，以适应祖国飞跃发展的伟大形势和全国人民一起高举毛泽东思想红旗迈步前进。
