　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st: A special correspondent for the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" in New York, Comrade Karev, revealed in a report that the United States is attempting to obstruct the United Nations Security Council from discussing the South African government's large-scale massacre of peaceful residents.
　　Karev wrote that representatives of some countries in the Security Council do not want to make any decisions on this issue. The actions of the U.S. representative, Lodge, who was the President of the Security Council in March, demonstrated this point.
　　First, Lodge delayed the date of the Security Council meeting by several days. After the discussion began, he tried to end the meeting before April 1st, because he would no longer be the President after April 1st.
　　Karev pointed out that drawing world public opinion's attention to the brutality of the South African federal racists is detrimental to the United States. This is because, firstly, the United States does not want to damage its relationship with the South African government, as the United States obtains uranium from South Africa; secondly, South African racism is rampant at the same time that American racism is engaging in rampant activities.

    苏联“消息报”记者揭露
    美国和南非政府同恶相济
    洛奇曾经力图阻挠安理会讨论南非局势
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联“消息报”驻纽约特派记者卡列夫在一篇报道中揭露美国企图阻挠联合国安理会讨论南非政府大规模屠杀和平居民的问题。
    卡列夫写道，安理会中一些国家的代表不希望对这个问题作出任何决定。安理会3月份的主席、美国代表洛奇的行为就表明了这点。
    首先，洛奇把召开安理会会议的日期拖延了几天，在讨论开始后，他又力求在4月1日以前结束会议，因为到4月1日他就不当主席了。
    卡列夫指出，引起世界舆论注意南非联邦种族主义者的残暴行为对美国是不利的。因为，第一，美国不愿损坏同南非政府的关系；因为美国从南非得到铀矿，第二，南非种族主义嚣张的时候也正是美国种族主义猖狂活动的时候。
