    Eliminate Wheat Pests and Diseases
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    Wheat in the main wheat-producing areas north of the Yangtze River will be harvested in less than two months. The closer wheat gets to maturity, the more susceptible it becomes to pests and diseases. This year, wheat is growing well in most areas, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Protecting wheat from the invasion of pests and diseases is an urgent task at present.
    Recently, in many wheat fields in Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangsu and other provinces, diseases and insect pests such as rust, scab, wheat blossom midge, and armyworm have occurred. Various localities are stepping up their control efforts to ensure a good harvest. Years of experience have proven that as long as we are vigilant, well-prepared, prevent problems before they occur, and treat them as soon as they appear, wheat pests and diseases can be completely eliminated.
    In the later stages of wheat growth, there are many types of pests and diseases that often occur in combination and can spread rapidly. To eliminate these disasters, we must act like organizing a battle, promptly identify the disaster situation, concentrate superior forces, take swift action, and launch a concentrated encirclement and suppression campaign. On the basis of broadly mobilizing the masses, combine specialized wheat field management teams with large-scale mass shock prevention and control efforts, conduct a comprehensive investigation while simultaneously treating the affected areas, treating each affected patch as it is discovered, treating each affected spot as it is found, treating frequently, and treating continuously to eliminate pests and diseases as soon as they occur.
    To eliminate wheat pests and diseases, sufficient pesticides and equipment must be prepared. The drugs recently allocated by the state to various regions for the control of wheat rust should be promptly distributed to the grassroots level to ensure that specialized drugs are used for specialized purposes. In some areas where drugs and equipment are insufficient, the masses should be mobilized as soon as possible, and various departments should be organized to cooperate closely, using local materials to create indigenous or combined indigenous-foreign pesticides and machinery. Yangling Commune in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, recently created a "rust-prevention sulfur smoke agent," which is ignited in the fields in the early morning and evening when the air pressure is low to prevent rust, with good results. Facts show that as long as the wisdom of the broad masses is mobilized, and the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and vigorously promoting technological innovation is implemented, powerful weapons for preventing and controlling pests and diseases can be created, and the difficulties of insufficient drugs and equipment can be overcome.
    In the struggle to prevent and control wheat pests and diseases, the industrial, commercial, and transportation departments should regard it as an urgent task and vigorously support the rural communes. The handicraft, commercial, and agricultural departments of Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province have closely cooperated, organizing spraying equipment repair and fitting stations and mobile equipment repair and fitting teams, manufacturing large quantities of parts, and helping farmers repair and modify damaged sprayers and dusters, greatly accelerating the progress of pest and disease control. This approach is worth promoting.

    扑灭小麦病虫害
    本报评论员
    长江以北主要产麦区的小麦，不到两月就要收获了。小麦越接近成熟期，越容易发生病虫害。今年多数地区小麦生长良好，丰收在望。保护小麦不受病虫害的侵袭，是当前的紧急工作。
    最近河南、山东、陕西、江苏等省有不少麦田发生了锈病、赤霉病、吸浆虫、粘虫等病虫害，各地正在加紧除治，以保丰收。多年的经验证明，只要我们提高警惕，戒备周到，防之于未然，治之于初现，小麦病虫害是完全可以扑灭的。
    在小麦生长后期，病虫害种类很多，经常交错发生，而且往往来势甚猛。要扑灭这些灾害，必须像组织战役那样，及早查明灾情，集中优势力量，迅速行动，突击围剿。在广泛发动群众的基础上，把麦田管理专业队和大规模的群众性突击防治结合起来，普遍清查，边查边治，发现一片治一片，发现一点治一点，经常治，连续治，把病虫害消灭在刚发生的时候。
    要扑灭小麦病虫害，必须准备足够的农药和器械。最近国家分配给各地的除治麦锈病的药物，应当迅速发给基层，做到专药专用。有些地方药械不足，应该及早发动群众，组织各部门密切协作，就地取材，大造土的或土洋结合的农药械。陕西兴平县杨陵公社最近创制了“防锈硫磺烟雾剂”，在早晚低气压的时候，在地头点燃硫磺烟雾剂，防治锈病，效果很好。事实说明，只要把广大群众的智慧发动起来，实行土洋结合、就地取材的方针，大搞技术革新，就能造出威力很大的防治病虫害的武器，克服药械不足的困难。
    在防治小麦病虫害的斗争中，工业、商业和交通运输部门，应当作为一件紧急任务，大力支援农村公社。江苏苏州专区手工业、商业部门和农业部门密切配合，组织施药器械修配站和流动器械修配小组，大造零件，帮助农民修配和改装损坏的喷雾器、喷粉器，大大加速了防治病虫害的进度。这种作法值得提倡。
