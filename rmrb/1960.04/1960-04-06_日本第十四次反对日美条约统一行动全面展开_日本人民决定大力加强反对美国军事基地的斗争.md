Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: The Japanese people today launched various activities nationwide, holding the 14th united action week against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Members of unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and some independent unions held workplace rallies in various locations. Leading the struggle in this action are the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All Japan Harbor Workers' Union, and taxi driver unions.

In these workplace gatherings, workers, while demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," also demanded wage increases and the safeguarding of workers' rights. These gatherings also protested the capitalists' crime of murdering workers at the Mitsui Mining Company's Miike coal mine. At the same time, 1,600 joint struggle organizations against the new "Security Treaty" across the country held mass rallies, demonstrations, signature campaigns, and publicity campaigns today.

In Tokyo, fifty representatives from the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party visited the speakers of both houses of the Diet, demanding that the Diet reject the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

In addition, one hundred farmer representatives visited the speakers of both houses of the Diet and Liberal Democratic Party Diet members from their prefectures, demanding that the Diet not ratify the new "Security Treaty."

Tonight, more than twenty mass rallies were held in Tokyo. A total of 13,000 people participated in these gatherings. After the meetings, lantern parades were also held.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch, Tokyo News: Approximately fifty representatives from the Japan National Liaison Council Against Military Bases held a meeting in Tokyo yesterday and today, deciding to closely integrate the anti-base movement with the anti-new "Security Treaty" movement.

The meeting decided to investigate and study various situations where the Japanese people are harmed by U.S. military bases, and to take effective actions against U.S. military bases during U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan in June. The meeting decided to launch a powerful struggle against the establishment of missile bases by the U.S. military in Okinawa. The meeting pointed out that Okinawa has completely become a U.S. nuclear weapons base, and if Japan does not recover Okinawa and drive the U.S. troops out of Okinawa, Japan will not be able to obtain peace and independence. The meeting decided to support the struggle of the Okinawan residents and is preparing to hold a national rally in Tokyo demanding the return of Okinawa.

The meeting also emphasized the need to organize the national people to support the struggle against the U.S. military's requisition of land in Sunagawa Town to expand the base and the struggle against the "Defense Agency's" establishment of missile launch sites in Niijima and "Self-Defense Force" bases in Hyakurigahara.

    日本人民决定大力加强反对美国军事基地的斗争
    新华社5日讯　日本人民今天在全国展开各种活动，举行反对新日美“安全条约”的第十四次统一行动周。
    日本工会总评议会所属工会和一些独立工会的会员在各地举行了工作场所大会。在这个行动中率先展开斗争的是合成化学产业工会联合会、全日本港湾工会和出租汽车司机的工会组织。
    在这些工作场所集会中，工人们在要求废除新日美“安全条约”的同时，还要求提高工资和维护工人的权利。这些集会还抗议资本家杀害三井矿山公司三池煤矿工人的罪行。同时，全国各地的一千六百个反对新“安全条约”共同斗争组织今天举行群众集会、示威、签名运动和宣传运动。
    在东京，日本共产党东京都委员会的五十名代表访问了国会两院议长，要求国会拒绝批准新日美“安全条约”。

    会议决定调查和研究日本人民受到美军基地祸害的各种情况，并且在美国总统艾森豪威尔6月访问日本的时候采取反对美军基地的有效行动。会议决定展开强有力斗争，反对美军在冲绳建立导弹基地。会议指出，冲绳已经完全成为美国的核武器基地，如果日本不收回冲绳和把美国军队赶出冲绳，日本将不可能获得和平和独立。会议决定支持冲绳居民的斗争，并且准备在东京举行要求归还冲绳国民大会。
    会议还强调必须组织全国人民支持反对美军征用砂川町土地扩大基地的斗争和反对“防卫厅”在新岛建立导弹发射场、在百里原建立“自卫队”基地的斗争。
