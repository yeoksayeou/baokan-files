Oil Crop Production Must Also Leap Forward
By People's Daily Commentator

The spring oil crop planting season has begun in the south, and the peak season for oil crop planting in the north is also approaching. This is the most crucial period for oil crop production this year. In the first two years of the Second Five-Year Plan, China's oil crop production has made great achievements. However, compared with the growth rate of grain and cotton, it is still slower and cannot meet the growing needs of national construction and people's lives. Therefore, we must make a great determination to do a good job in this year's oil crop planting work so that oil crop production also takes a great leap forward.

In order to ensure a high-speed leap forward in oil crop production this year, we must first ensure that oil crops are given a certain planting area. In the past, the development speed of oil crop production was not as fast as that of grain and cotton. An important reason for this is that the planting area plans in many places have not been completed. It cannot be denied that there is a certain contradiction between developing grain production and developing oil crop production. However, we must not only look at the contradictory and opposing side, but also look at the unified side. Grain and oil crops certainly both occupy arable land, but they each have suitable land. For example, planting grain on sandy soil can only yield dozens of kilograms per mu, while planting peanuts can yield hundreds of kilograms per mu. Such land should of course be used to plant peanuts. At the same time, there are many kinds of oil crops. If rapeseed cannot be planted, peanuts can be planted; if peanuts cannot be planted, soybeans, sesame, and sunflowers can be planted; if herbaceous plants cannot be planted, woody plants can be planted; if they cannot be planted on flat land, they can be planted on mountains; if they cannot be planted alone, they can be intercropped with certain grain crops; in addition, the masses can be widely mobilized to reclaim wasteland and utilize scattered plots of land. It can be seen that the key to the problem lies in whether the leadership can make reasonable arrangements for various crops according to the principle of adapting to local conditions. This was impossible in the era of small-scale peasant economy; it was still subject to certain restrictions in the era of advanced cooperatives; and it is now completely possible after the people's communes were established. Jianyang County in Sichuan Province is a good example. This county fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes being large in scale and publicly owned, and unified the planting of various crops. In 1959, not only did grain production increase by 20% compared to 1958, but peanut production also increased by 33%.

To ensure the completion of the oil crop planting plan, it is necessary to strengthen specific leadership. Those who have already started planting should be urged to inspect and ensure that not a single mu is missed, and not a single row is missed. Those who have not yet started planting should quickly implement the planting plan to the team and to the field. In areas where there are fewer oil crops planted and edible oil cannot be self-sufficient, more oil crops should be planted appropriately to quickly change the situation of relying on supplies of edible oil from other places and achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil. Areas that have planted more oil crops and have a surplus of edible oil in the past should also carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, and work hard to actively increase the yield per unit area, increase the production of more oil crops, and support cities and national construction. The leadership should quickly help solve the various specific difficulties in planting oil crops. For example, at present, a small number of areas have insufficient peanut seeds, or although the quantity is sufficient, the quality is not high and the germination rate is low. Measures such as "equal value exchange," "grain for seeds," and "cash purchase" should be adopted to organize the transfer and exchange of peanut seeds, or to select good commercial peanuts for use as seeds.

In order to greatly increase the yield per unit area of oil crops, effective measures to increase production should be formulated based on the experience of increasing production last year, and implemented into production. This year, in order to rapidly increase oil production, various places have decided to establish high-yield demonstration plots. The area of ​​high-yield demonstration plots generally accounts for 30%-50% of the oil crop area. This is of great significance to oil production. All localities should earnestly do a good job in high-yield demonstration plots, not only to make high-yield demonstration plots greatly increase production, but also to make high-yield demonstration plots drive the general fields to increase production together.

In addition, many regions have also established commercial oil crop production bases to ensure the current needs of all parties for commercial oil, which is also a new and important measure to promote oil production this year. The establishment of commercial oil crop production bases is a new task, and there is still insufficient experience. In accordance with the principle of "doing, learning, and improving," under the unified leadership of the local party committee, relevant departments should cooperate closely, strengthen technical guidance, and take some necessary organizational measures and economic measures to actively build oil crop bases well. Various localities can also closely combine the establishment of commercial oil crop production bases with the establishment of high-yield oil crop demonstration plots, so as to make the bases more solid and better.

The current oil crop production situation is very good. Many places have strengthened the leadership of oil crop production, and the vast number of cadres and masses have high confidence and great enthusiasm in increasing oil production. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the oil crop planting task, we should adhere to putting politics in command, comprehensively organize forces, conduct timely inspections, vigorously promote advanced experience, and ensure that this year's spring oil crop planting is more, faster, and better.

### 油料生产也要大跃进

    油料生产也要大跃进
    本报评论员
    现在，南方的春季油料作物已经开始播种，北方地区油料播种的高潮也要到来。这是今年油料生产中最关紧要的时期。在第二个五年计划的头两年中，我国油料生产成绩很大。但是同粮食、棉花的增产速度比较，还是较慢的，也还不能满足国家建设和人民生活的日益增长的需要。因此，我们必须下大决心，作好今年的油料播种工作，使油料生产也来一个大跃进。
    为了保证今年油料生产高速度地跃进，首先必须保证给予油料作物一定的种植面积。过去油料生产发展速度所以不如粮食、棉花快，一个很重要的原因，就是不少地方的播种面积计划没有完成。不能否认，发展粮食生产和发展油料生产有一定的矛盾。然而不能只看矛盾对立的一面，还要看统一的一面。粮食和油料固然都要占用耕地，可是它们又各有适宜的土地。例如在沙土地上种粮食，每亩只能收几十斤，种花生每亩就可收几百斤，这样的土地当然应该种花生。同时，油料的种类很多，不能种油菜的，可种花生；不能种花生的，可种大豆、芝麻、向日葵；不能种草本的，还可种木本的；不能在平地上种的，可以在山上种；不能单独种的，可以跟某些粮食作物间作套种；此外，还可以广泛发动群众开垦荒地和利用零星土地。可见问题的关键，在于领导上能不能根据因地制宜的原则，对各种作物合理的安排。这一点，在小农经济时期办不到；在高级社时期还受到一定的限制；在人民公社化后就完全能够办到。四川省简阳县就是一个很好的例子，这个县由于充分地发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，统一安排各种作物的种植，1959年不仅粮食比1958年增产20％，花生也增产33％。
    要保证完成油料作物播种计划，必须加强具体领导。现在已经开始播种的，应当督促检查，保证做到一亩不少播，一行不少种。尚未开始播种的，应当很快把播种计划落实到队，落实到田块。在种植油料较少，食油不能自给的地区，更应当适当多种一些油料作物，迅速改变依赖外地供应食油的情况，做到食油自给。过去种植油料较多、食油有余的地区，也要发扬共产主义协作精神，从积极提高单位面积产量方面下大功夫，增产更多的油料，支援城市，支援国家建设。对于播种油料作物中的各种具体困难，领导上应当赶快帮助解决。例如目前少数地区花生种子不足或数量虽够，但质量不高，发芽率低，应该采取“等价交换”
  “以粮换种”和“现款收买”等办法，组织调剂互换花生种子，或挑选好的商品花生供作种子用。
    为了大大提高油料作物的单位面积产量，应当根据去年增产经验，制定出切实有效的增产措施，并且贯彻到生产中去。今年各地为了迅速提高油料产量，都决定建立丰产方。丰产方的面积，一般占到油料面积的30％—50％。这对于油料生产有着重要意义。各地应该切实把丰产方搞好，不仅要使丰产方大大丰产，还要使丰产方把一般田也带动起来，共同丰产。
    此外，不少地区还建立了商品油料生产基地，保证目前各方面对商品油料的需要，也是促进今年油料增产的一项新的重要措施。建立商品油料生产基地是一项新的工作，经验还不足，应当本着“边做、边学、边改进”的原则，在当地党委统一领导下，有关部门通力协作，加强技术指导，采取一些必要的组织措施和经济措施，积极把油料基地建好。各地还可把建立商品油料生产基地和建立油料丰产方的工作密切结合起来，使基地搞得更扎实、更好。
    当前的油料生产形势是非常好的。许多地方都加强了对油料生产的领导，广大干部和群众对于增产油料的信心很高，干劲很大。为了保证胜利完成油料播种任务，应当坚持政治挂帅，全面组织力量，及时进行检查，大力推广先进经验，保证今年的春季油料播种的又多、又快、又好。
