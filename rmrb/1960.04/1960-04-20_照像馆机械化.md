    Mechanization of Photography Studios
    The employees of the Shengsheng Photography Studio in Heping District, Shenyang City, have created twenty-one precision machines and tools, mechanizing the entire photographic process from taking the picture, exposure and enlargement, developing, drying, to cutting the prints. This has improved work efficiency, saved manpower, and shortened the time for customers to receive their photos.
    Now, this photography studio places the negatives taken by the camera onto the exposure glass of an automatic printing machine. With the press of a button, the machine can automatically expose the prints rhythmically. As the machine rotates, a conveyor belt automatically transports the exposed prints to the developing tank. After a certain period, turning on the power activates a dryer that dries and flattens the developed prints. Then, the photos are placed on a cutting machine, and with the flip of a switch, the automatic cutting machine can cut the edges and package them according to your requirements. (Attached photo)

Customers only need to buy a copper token and insert it into a specially designed small window. This activates the power, and the camera begins to work amidst pleasant music, automatically taking the photo and winding the film. It only takes half a minute to take a picture, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to the past. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Shilin, photo

    照像馆机械化
    沈阳市和平区生生照像馆职工创造了二十一项精密机器、工具，使照像从拍照、暴光放大、洗片、干燥直到切片全部实现了机械化，提高了工作效率，节省了人力，缩短了顾客取片时间。
    现在，这个照像馆把摄影机拍完的像版放在自动晒像机的暴光镜上，一按电钮，机器就可以有节奏地自动暴光。随着机器的转动传送带就自动地把暴好光的像片送到洗片槽内，经过一定的时间一开电门干燥机就把洗好的像片进行干燥和压平。然后将照片放在切片机上，一开电门自动切片机就可以按着你的要求切边和装桶。（附图片）
