    Over 10 Million People in Hunan Engage in Large-Scale Sanitation Campaign
    Over ten million people in Hunan Province, combining production with hygiene, have launched a sanitation blitz. From March 24th to the end of March, in a week, they eliminated over 7.49 million rats, as well as a large number of bedbugs, fly pupae, and mosquitoes. They also combined the sanitation campaign with collecting over 700 million dan of fertilizer.

    The momentum, scale, and achievements of this sanitation campaign surpassed any in the past two years. A new upsurge of sanitation campaigns, led by secretaries and involving the entire Party and all the people, has emerged in various places.

    During the campaign, various localities implemented the principle of "addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, with emphasis on addressing the root causes," with clear focus and effective measures. Many cities and towns, based on urban planning and combined with municipal construction, built public toilets, cleared sewers, eliminated standing water, filled in depressions, and, with everyone wielding fly swatters or other tools for eliminating the four pests, vigorously eliminated the four pests and carried out sanitation work.

    Yuanqu Residents Each Do Three Good Deeds to Support Agriculture
    Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province, has launched a large-scale, nationwide movement to support agricultural production.

    The Yuanqu County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the county to support this year's agricultural production with practical actions by doing three good deeds each. They also requested that one deed be completed before "May Day," one before "July 1st," and one before "National Day." The three good deeds should revolve around agricultural technical innovation and technical revolution, aiming for more and better quality of production increases; higher efficiency and labor savings; and greater practical effect and value creation.

    To ensure the rapid development of this movement throughout the county, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee took the lead, establishing a "Three Good Deeds" Office. All government departments and units have guiding groups to specifically guide the progress of the movement. In terms of implementation methods, first, they organized study to enhance understanding of supporting agricultural production through studying documents; second, everyone contributed ideas and suggestions to formulate specific plans; third, they carried out large-scale collaboration and assistance, creating momentum for nationwide support for agricultural production.

    Nearly 100,000 Cotton Farmers in Weinan Learn from Zhang Qiuxiang's Experience
    In Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, more than 98,000 cotton farmers persisted in learning from the cotton-growing experience of cotton expert Zhang Qiuxiang, breaking the mood of relaxation after rain, and seizing the opportunity to sow cotton early, launching a red flag emulation campaign throughout the county to fight the battle of cotton sowing.

    Last year, Weinan County had more than 70 mu of "Qiuxiang fields," with a yield of over 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year, the number of teams participating in the Qiuxiang farming group has increased three or four times compared to last year, and the area of "Qiuxiang fields" in the county has also increased by more than 280,000 mu compared to last year, reaching a total of 314,000 mu. The Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that if all 314,000 mu of "Qiuxiang fields" in the county reach the advanced level of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, the county's cotton production plan can be overfulfilled.

    Xinjiang to Expand Long-Staple Cotton Planting Area Sixfold
    This year, people's communes and farms in the Turpan Basin and Tarim Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will vigorously increase the planting of long-staple cotton.

In order to enable the communes and farms to better master long-staple cotton planting techniques, relevant departments of the Autonomous Region held a long-staple cotton training class at the Turpan Cotton Crop Experiment Station as early as January.

    Last year, the region planted a total of 10,889 mu of long-staple cotton, which had high yields and good quality. According to the Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Factory's tests on the "Er Yu San" long-staple cotton planted in Xinjiang, the fiber strength reached more than 4.5 grams, and 150-count yarn could be spun.

The county's 300,000 people have planted an average of over 120 squash seedlings each.
