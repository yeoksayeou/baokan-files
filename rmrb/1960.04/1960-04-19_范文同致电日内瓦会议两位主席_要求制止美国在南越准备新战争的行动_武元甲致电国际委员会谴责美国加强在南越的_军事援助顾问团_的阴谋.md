Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th: Phạm Văn Đồng, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has requested the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to take measures to stop the dangerous actions of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities aimed at strengthening the US military forces in South Vietnam.

Phạm Văn Đồng made this request in an urgent telegram sent on the 16th to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are the chair countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference.

The telegram reads as follows:
    To the two Chairmen:

    I have the honor to inform you that the US government and the South Vietnamese authorities have reached an agreement to increase the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam's military organization called the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," claiming that this is to replace the former French military instructors.

    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam considers this to be an extremely serious matter that directly affects the maintenance of peace and the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes it necessary to clarify its views to the two Chairmen.

    The Geneva Accords ended the French war of aggression in our country and recognized Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. To lay the foundation for lasting peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulated that French "Expeditionary Forces" should withdraw from Vietnamese territory. At the same time, Article 16 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulates: "From the effective date of this Agreement, the introduction into Vietnam of any reinforcement in the form of troops and military personnel... is prohibited." Paragraph 4 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also stipulates that "the introduction into Vietnam of foreign troops and military personnel... is prohibited."

    The above provisions are very clear. The final withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam is a natural step, in line with the obligations undertaken by the French government and confirmed by the Geneva Conference. The purpose of doing so is to eliminate a tool for provoking war in Vietnam. Therefore, there is no question of any foreign troops or military personnel replacing the French military personnel of the French "Expeditionary Force." Such an action can only mean the entry of a new tool of aggression into Vietnam, against the independence and sovereignty of Vietnam and preparing a new war.

    The practice of proposing the entry of American military personnel into South Vietnam to strengthen the US military organization "Military Assistance Advisory Group" under the pretext of replacing former French military personnel is a distortion of the Geneva Accords and a very blatant and extremely serious provocative act by the Americans in Indochina.

    The "Military Assistance Advisory Group," this US military organization, was established in South Vietnam during the war and was a tool for the US to prolong and expand the war. Maintaining this organization after the restoration of peace in Indochina is completely illegal. Moreover, over the past five years, new US military personnel have continued to enter South Vietnam, establishing new organizations similar to the US general staff and headquarters in South Vietnam. This personnel has been sent to various central military organizations in South Vietnam, as well as to important troops and local organizations. These US military organizations control the organization, training, and equipment of the South Vietnamese army; they also supervise the construction of US military bases in South Vietnam, which are directly linked to US military bases in other parts of Southeast Asia.

    While these repeated violations of the Geneva Accords have not been properly resolved, the US government and the South Vietnamese authorities are taking new steps to further undermine the Geneva Accords. They collude with each other to openly increase the number of American military personnel in the "Military Assistance Advisory Group."

    This is a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords, an abuse of these accords to open up a legalized path for openly transporting US troops into South Vietnam to serve the US policy of aggression in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    This conspiracy of the South Vietnamese authorities is part of their entire conspiracy to blatantly undermine the Geneva Accords. They refuse to convene consultative conferences to discuss the issue of general elections to achieve national reunification. They pursue a policy of terror in South Vietnam, massively and cruelly slaughtering former resistance personnel and other patriots. They demand that they be allowed to transport US weapons into South Vietnam to replace the weapons of the French "Expeditionary Force." Now they are asking the International Commission to allow them to transport US military personnel into South Vietnam to replace the military personnel of the French "Expeditionary Force." In this way, they have seriouslyviolated Article 16 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, and Paragraphs Four and Twelve of the Geneva Conference Final Declaration.

    If the above situation is not stopped in time, it may bring serious and harmful consequences to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and will increase the danger to the peace and security of the people of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam express great concern about this development.

    To the two Chairmen,

    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which faithfully pursues a policy of peace, wishes to draw your special attention to the above situation and requests you, for the sake of lasting peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and for the sake of implementing the Geneva Accords, to take timely measures to stop the dangerous actions of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities, which are aimed at undermining the Geneva Accords, strengthening military forces, and preparing to launch a new war. Therefore, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two Chairmen to instruct the International Commission in Vietnam to reject the illegal demand of the South Vietnamese authorities to increase the American military personnel of the "Military Assistance Advisory Group."

    To the two Chairmen, please accept my highest respect.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 16th: General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission, regarding the US government and the South Vietnamese authorities' plot to increase the military personnel of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam under the pretext of replacing French military instructors in South Vietnam, pointing out that this "is an extremely serious issue for peace in Vietnam and Indochina."

In the telegram, General Võ Nguyên Giáp requested the International Commission to firmly reject the illegal demands of the South Vietnamese authorities, to prohibit the transportation of more US military personnel to South Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and to demand that the South Vietnamese authorities disband and withdraw from South Vietnam the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group," which is a tool for US intervention and enslavement of South Vietnam.

The telegram from General Võ Nguyên Giáp was released by Tạ Quang Bửu, Deputy Minister of National Defense of Vietnam, at a press conference this afternoon.

### 范文同致电日内瓦会议两位主席  要求制止美国在南越准备新战争的行动  武元甲致电国际委员会谴责美国加强在南越的“军事援助顾问团”的阴谋

    范文同致电日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求制止美国在南越准备新战争的行动
    武元甲致电国际委员会谴责美国加强在南越的“军事援助顾问团”的阴谋
    新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国外交部长范文同要求1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两主席采取措施，制止美国和南越当局目的在于加强美国在南越的军事力量的危险行动。
    范文同是在16日打给苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的紧急电报中提出这个要求的。苏联和英国是1954年日内瓦会议的主席国。
    电文如下：两位主席先生：
    我谨通知你们，美国政府和南越当局已经达成了一项协议，要增加美国在南越的名叫“军事援助顾问团”的军事机构的美国军事人员，硬说这是为了代替前法国军事教官。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，这是一个极其严重的问题，直接影响着维护和平和继续履行日内瓦协议。因此越南民主共和国政府认为有必要对两位主席阐明它的观点。
    日内瓦协议结束了法国在我国进行的侵略战争，并且承认了越南主权、独立、统一和领土的完整。为了替印度支那和东南亚的持久和平奠定基础，日内瓦协议以及日内瓦会议的最后宣言都清楚规定，法国“远征军”应当从越南领土撤退。同时，关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十六条规定：“自本协定生效时起，禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南”。日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四段也规定“禁止外国军队和军事人员进入越南”。
    上述条款是十分明确的。法国军队的最后撤出越南是当然的步骤，是符合法国政府所承担并经日内瓦会议所确认的义务的，这样做的目的是为了消除在越南挑起战争的一个工具。因此不存在有任何外国军队或军事人员来代替法国“远征军”的法国军事人员的问题。这种行动只能意味着一种新的侵略工具进入越南，反对越南的独立和主权并准备新的战争。
    借口代替前法国军事人员，提出美国军事人员进入南越以加强美国军事机构“军事援助顾问团”这个问题的作法，是一种歪曲日内瓦协议的行为，是美国人在印度支那所进行的一种非常露骨的极为严重的挑衅行为。
    “军事援助顾问团”这个美国军事机构早在战时就在南越建立，是美国延长和扩大战争的工具。在印度支那恢复和平以后，保持这个机构是完全非法的。而且，在过去五年中，美国新的军事人员继续不断进入南越，建立类似美国在南越的参谋部和司令部的新机构。这种人员被派往南越各中央军事机构直至重要部队和地方机构。这些美国军事机构控制着南越军队的组织、训练和装备；他们还监督在南越修建美国军事基地，这些基地是同美国在东南亚其他地区的军事基地直接联系的。
    在这些一再违反日内瓦协议的行动还没有得到适当的解决的时候，美国政府和南越当局又采取新的步骤变本加厉地破坏日内瓦协议，它们相互勾结公然增加“军事援助顾问团”的美国军事人员。
    这是粗暴地违反日内瓦协议的行为，是滥用这些协议来开辟一条合法化的道路，以便公然把美国的军队运入南越，为美国在印度支那和东南亚的侵略政策服务。
    南越当局的这种阴谋是他们明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议的整个阴谋的一部分。他们拒绝召开协商会议来讨论将实现国家统一的普选问题。他们在南越奉行恐怖政策，大规模地残酷屠杀前抗战人员和其它爱国者。他们要求让他们把美国武器运入南越来代替法国“远征军”的武器。现在他们又要求国际委员会准许他们把美国军事人员运入南越来代替法国“远征军”的军事人员。这样，他们就严重地违反了关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定的第十六条和日内瓦会议最后宣言第四和第十二段的规定。
    如果上述情况没有及时予以制止，就可能给履行日内瓦协议带来严重危害的后果，并且将会增加对印度支那和东南亚人民的和平和安全的危险。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府对于这种事态的转变表示极大的关注。
    两位主席先生，
    忠诚不渝地奉行和平政策的越南民主共和国政府希望特别提请你们注意上述情况，并且要求你们，为了印度支那和东南亚的持久和平，为了履行日内瓦协议，及时采取措施来制止美国和南越当局的危险行动，这种行动旨在破坏日内瓦协议，加强军事力量和准备发动新战争。因此，越南民主共和国政府要求两位主席指示越南国际委员会拒绝南越当局提出的增加“军事援助顾问团”的美国军事人员的非法要求。
    两位主席，谨向你们致以我的最崇高的敬意。
    据新华社河内16日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲大将就美国政府和南越当局阴谋以代替法国在南越的军事教官为借口，增加在南越的“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员这件事打电报给国际委员会主席安萨里，指出这“对越南和印度支那的和平来说，是极其严重的问题”。
    武元甲大将在电报中要求国际委员会坚决拒绝南越当局的不合法的要求，根据日内瓦协议的规定禁止向南越运进更多的美国军事人员；要求南越当局解散和从南越撤出作为美国干涉和奴役南越的工具的“美国军事援助顾问团”。
    武元甲大将的电报是由越南国防部副部长谢光宝在今天下午的记者招待会上公布的。
