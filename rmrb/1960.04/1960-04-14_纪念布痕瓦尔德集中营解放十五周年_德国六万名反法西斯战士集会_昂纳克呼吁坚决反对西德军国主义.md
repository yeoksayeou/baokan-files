Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 11th: Sixty thousand anti-fascist fighters rallied in Buchenwald on the 10th to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp.

Among those attending the rally were Erich Honecker, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Germany, and representatives of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters.

Speaking at the meeting, Honecker said that although the German Democratic Republic had eradicated the roots of fascism, the Nazis who murdered tens of thousands of resistance fighters in Buchenwald still hold important positions in West Germany. He said that the German Democratic Republic calls on the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, and non-partisan workers in West Germany to join the working people of the German Democratic Republic in opposing militarism. Promoting understanding between the two Germanys is the sacred duty of the resistance fighters of both Germanys.

Representatives of the Soviet Veterans Committee and representatives of the French and West German public also spoke at the meeting.

Five hundred West German Social Democrats and young trade union members attended a nationwide symposium held in Weimar, near Buchenwald, on the morning of the 10th. Also attending the symposium were Hermann Matern, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Reimann, among others.

    昂纳克呼吁坚决反对西德军国主义
    新华社柏林11日电　六万名反法西斯战士10日在布痕瓦尔德举行集会，纪念布痕瓦尔德集中营解放十五周年。
    参加这次集会的有德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员昂纳克、德国共产党第一书记雷曼以及抵抗运动战士国际联合会的代表等。
    昂纳克在会上讲话时说，虽然德意志民主共和国已经铲除了法西斯主义的老根，但是，在布痕瓦尔德杀害成千上万抵抗战士的纳粹分子，现在仍然在西德窃据重要的职位。他说，德意志民主共和国呼吁西德的社会民主党、基督教民主联盟和无党派的工人们，同德意志民主共和国的劳动人民一道反对军国主义。促进两个德国之间的谅解是两个德国的抵抗运动战士的神圣职责。
    苏联退伍军人委员会的代表以及法国和西德公众的代表都在会上讲了话。
    五百名西德的社会民主党人和年青的工会会员等参加了10日上午在布痕瓦尔德附近的魏玛举行的全德座谈会。参加这次座谈会的还有德国统一社会党中央政治局委员马特恩以及雷曼等人。
