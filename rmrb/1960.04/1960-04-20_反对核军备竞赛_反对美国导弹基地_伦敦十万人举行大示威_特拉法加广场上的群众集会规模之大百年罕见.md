London, April 18th (reported by this newspaper) – Forty thousand demonstrators who started from Aldermaston marched triumphantly into their final destination today - Trafalgar Square in central London - and gathered with another 60,000 people to hold a rally of 100,000 people. The rally demanded that the British government ban nuclear weapons, abolish US missile bases, prohibit US aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs from patrolling in Britain, and pursue a policy of peace. This is the largest anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in British history.

Among these 100,000 demonstrators, 10,000 people had walked from Aldermaston, the location of the British Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. They had covered 53 kilometers in the past four days. Hundreds of people joined their ranks every hour along the way. By the time of the final demonstration, the number of people had snowballed to 100,000.

The vast scale of the march was not its only distinguishing feature. The marching crowd included ordinary people of all classes and political views except the ruling class.

Men and women, old and young, workers, teachers, students, housewives, communists, pacifists, Labour Party members, Liberal Party members, religious believers, and non-religious believers marched shoulder to shoulder. For four days, they ate and slept together, and their mutual solidarity increased further in the process of common struggle. Singing songs, holding placards, and shouting various slogans, they unanimously demanded opposition to the nuclear arms race, the abolition of bases, and unanimously demanded peace. Some ordinary members of the Conservative Party also participated in the march in their individual capacity, holding placards that read "Conservatives are here too." A blind person was also in the procession, being helped forward by others.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators held up the most eye-catching placards, including a huge portrait of US President Eisenhower, next to which was recorded a frightening remark he had made: "If I don't get any benefit on our side, I will use the hydrogen bomb immediately."

Many marchers used strollers to carry their children. A middle-aged woman from the Peter district pushed a stroller with a sign that read: "For the sake of our children, there should be universal disarmament." A child of about ten years old carried a sign that read: "I love life."

Wherever the marching crowd went, local residents crowded the streets, cheering and applauding them, and young children gave the marchers thumbs up.

Some fascists attempted to disrupt the march. They drove a car into the marching crowd, shouting "Keep the hydrogen bomb" and distributing some anti-communist leaflets. The marching crowd contemptuously trampled on these leaflets and continued to advance.

As the massive procession entered Trafalgar Square to participate in the mass rally, a loud and harmonious song was sung:

	“Men and women stand together,
	Never mind those warmongers,
	Everyone is determined,
	Vow to ban the hydrogen bomb forever.”

The flag that had been used to lead the march between Aldermaston and London demanding nuclear disarmament three times in the past three years was planted at the foot of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. The leaders of the demonstration began to speak to the crowd. At this time, the tail of the march was still in the suburbs of London, five kilometers away. When the last representative arrived at the square two hours later, the meeting officially began. In fact, the entire square had no empty space, and people climbed onto the roofs of various nearby buildings to watch the proceedings. Traffic in central London was interrupted for a long time. According to the police, this was a mass gathering in Trafalgar Square that had not been seen in a century.

Canon Collins, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: "Aldermaston has become a symbol of the unity of all those who demand the abolition of nuclear weapons. We are ordinary people, and we want to live in peace with the people of other countries." He also said: "The British people demand that Prime Minister Macmillan tell the summit meeting that Britain wants to get rid of all nuclear weapons."

Many marchers spoke at today's rally. Frank Cousins, general secretary of the largest Transport and General Workers' Union, said: "My union stands proudly at the forefront of the movement to get rid of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are militarily meaningless and mean economic suicide for Britain. Wasting money on these weapons prevents us from getting what we need."

An ordinary marcher from northwest England stood on the plinth amid applause and said: "We don't want American bases, we don't want Britain to remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

John Horner, leader of the Fire Brigades Union, finally appealed to the summit meeting, saying that the British people need a world without the threat of nuclear war.

At the end of the mass rally, Collins called on people to continue the struggle to make the government act according to the will of the people. The audience responded with a resounding: We will never stop fighting until we achieve victory. (Attached picture)

### 反对核军备竞赛　反对美国导弹基地  伦敦十万人举行大示威  特拉法加广场上的群众集会规模之大百年罕见

    反对核军备竞赛　反对美国导弹基地
    伦敦十万人举行大示威
    特拉法加广场上的群众集会规模之大百年罕见
    本报伦敦18日电　从阿尔德马斯顿出发的四万名示威群众今天浩浩荡荡地进入了最后目的地——伦敦中心的特拉法加广场，同另外六万名群众汇集一起举行十万人抗议集会，要求英国政府禁止核武器，取消美国的导弹基地和禁止载着氢弹的美国飞机在英国巡逻，并要求执行和平的政策。这是英国空前最大的一次反对核武器的示威。
    在这十万名示威群众中间，有一万人是从英国原子武器研究所所在地阿尔德马斯顿步行而来的。他们在过去四天走完了五十三公里。沿途每一小时都有上百群众加入他们的行列。而到了最后的示威大会上，群众更像滚雪球似的增加到十万人了。
    游行规模的浩大并不是唯一的特色。游行队伍包括了除了统治阶级以外的各种阶层、各种政治见解的普通人民。
    男女老幼、工人、教师、学生、家庭妇女、共产党人、和平主义者、工党人士、自由党人士、宗教信仰者、非宗教信仰者并肩前进。四天以来，他们共饮食共宿，在共同斗争的过程中更增加了相互的团结。他们唱着歌、举着标语牌、高呼着各种口号，一致要求反对核军备、取消基地，一致要求和平。一些保守党的普通党员也以个人身份举着“这里也有保守党人”的标语牌，参加了游行。队伍中还有一个双目失明的人，由别人扶着前进。
    成千成万的示威群众，高举着最引人注目的标语牌，其中有一幅美国总统艾森豪威尔的巨大画像，旁边还录了一句他吓唬人的话：“如果我在我们这方面得不到什么利益，我就要立刻使用氢弹。”
    许多游行者使用婴儿车携带了他们的孩子。一个从彼得教区来的中年妇女推着一辆婴儿车，上面挂了一面牌子，写道：“为了孩子应当普遍裁军”。一个大约十来岁的孩子带了一块牌子，上面写着：“我爱生命”。
    游行的队伍不论走到哪里，当地居民都挤到街上来，向他们欢呼并鼓掌，年轻的孩子们翘起大拇指向游行者祝贺。
    一些法西斯分子企图扰乱游行队伍。他们开了一辆车子冲进游行群众的队伍，叫嚷：“保持氢弹”并散发了一些反共传单，游行的群众轻蔑地践踏着这些传单继续前进。
    当巨大的行列进入特拉法加广场参加群众大会的时候，广场上发出了宏亮而和谐的歌声：
    “男男女女站在一起，
    别管那些战争贩子，
    大家共同下定决心，
    誓把氢弹永远禁止。”
    人们把过去三年中曾经三度带领着在阿尔德马斯顿和伦敦之间要求裁减核军备游行队伍的那面旗帜插在特拉法加广场纳尔逊柱的柱脚上，示威集会的领导人就开始向群众讲话，这时游行队伍的尾巴还在五公里外的伦敦郊区，当最后一名代表在两小时后到达广场，大会就正式开始了。实际上整个广场没有一点空隙的地方，人们纷纷爬上附近的各种建筑物的屋顶来观看大会的进行。伦敦中心的交通一直中断了很久。据警察说，这是特拉法加广场一百年来罕见的群众集会。
    争取裁减核军备运动的主席卡顿·柯林斯说：“阿尔德马斯顿已成为了一切要求废除核武器的人们团结的象征，我们是普通老百姓，我们要同其他国家的人民和平相处。”他还说：“英国人民要求麦克米伦首相告诉最高级会议，英国要摆脱一切核武器。”
    许多游行者在今天的大会上讲了话。最大的运输与普通工人工会总书记弗兰克·卡曾斯说：“我的工会光荣地站在摆脱核武器运动的最前列，核武器是军事上的毫无意义的东西，并且对于英国来说，意味着经济自杀。把钱糟蹋在这种武器上，就不能得到我们所需要的东西。”
    一个来自英格兰西北部的普通游行者在人们的掌声中立在柱脚上讲话说：“我们不要美国基地，我们不希望英国继续留在北大西洋公约组织中。”
    消防队员工会领袖约翰·霍尔纳最后向最高级会议发出呼吁，他说英国人民需要一个没有核战争威胁的世界。
    在群众大会结束的时候，柯林斯号召人们继续斗争使政府按照人民的意愿行事。听众给以响亮的回答：不取得胜利决不停止斗争。（附图片）
