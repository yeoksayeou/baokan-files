Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse the report made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. From these reports, we can see that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are closely united, of one heart and one mind, holding high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, overfulfilling the 1959 National Economic Plan, and achieving the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This has laid the most favorable foundation for a long-term, sustained Great Leap Forward in the future.

    Before coming to this meeting, I inspected the Pengpu, Changzheng, Xuhang, Maqiao, Huacao, Jiefang, Chengdong, and Xinwu People's Communes in Shanghai. Generally speaking, these communes are more consolidated and developed than they were in the second half of 1958 when they were first established. Many communes have already realized "farming without oxen, irrigation flowing automatically." The Xinwu People's Commune has more than 34,000 mu of farmland. Before the establishment of the commune, more than 16,500 mu of this land was located in a low-lying area, a "white water beach" in spring and autumn, with severe waterlogging, yielding only three harvests in nine years, a place that was abandoned in the past. Since the establishment of the commune, manpower and materials have been mobilized to open up the "Send Disaster River" and the "Construction River," transforming the perennial waterlogging into irrigation. In 1959, the "white water beach" was completely eliminated, achieving three harvests a year, meaning that the annual output now equals the total harvest of the past nine years. From this example, we can see that the People's Commune possesses abundant manpower, material resources, and resources. Whether in cultivation, harvesting, water conservancy construction, drought resistance and flood prevention, industrial development, etc., it can achieve the best use of talent, resources, and land. Its superiority is unparalleled.

    The Pengpu, Changzheng, Maqiao, and other People's Communes have all built residential areas. The peasants have moved into clean buildings equipped with electric lights, surrounded by hospitals, schools, canteens, homes for the elderly, nurseries, and kindergartens. Everyone lives an organized and happy life, school-age children attend school in a timely manner, and patients receive timely medical treatment. Women are liberated from housework and happily engage in various productions.

    In the Chengdong People's Commune, we also saw thirty-two elderly people, aged sixty-two to eighty-six, living peacefully in the home for the elderly, enjoying a comfortable old age. These collective welfare benefits, like a warm sun, shine on everyone. This is of course due to the great increase in agricultural production, but more importantly, it is due to the diversified economic management of the People's Commune, with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery all flourishing, and both public and private raising of poultry and livestock. This allows for a significant improvement in the lives of farmers on the basis of production development. For example, in the Taojiaqiao team of the Huacao People's Commune, consisting of thirty-two households, in 1949 they only had twenty-five woolen sweaters, less than one per household on average. In 1958, the first year of the Great Leap Forward after the establishment of the People's Commune, they had a total of eighty-eight woolen sweaters, an average of 2.7 per household; rubber shoes increased from forty-six pairs in 1949 to two hundred and thirty-three pairs in 1958, and fountain pens increased from three to seventy. Other various clothing and daily necessities have also seen similar increases in the homes of farmers in various communes to varying degrees. In the second year of the Great Leap Forward—the Spring Festival of 1959—after the commune distributed dividends, the purchasing power of the farmers increased even more. In the Pengpu People's Commune, 268 households received dividends of more than 1,000 yuan at the end of the year, which is the first miracle I have seen in my life. It can be seen that in terms of living standards, the difference between urban and rural areas is gradually narrowing. Therefore, the members of the People's Commune say: "Gold is good, silver is good, but the People's Commune is the best. The People's Commune is truly good, creating a paradise on earth. Where does the happy life come from? Thanks to our benefactor, the Communist Party." Recalling the poverty of the countryside, the farmers' lack of food and clothing that I saw in the old society, and comparing it with the happy and beautiful new countryside today, there is a world of difference. And the change in the face of the countryside now is only just beginning; the future is infinitely bright.

    I have been engaged in industrial and commercial activities for decades before liberation, and have suffered from the multiple oppressions of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. However, limited by my class nature, I was afraid of revolution and fantasized about taking the capitalist road under the semi-feudal and semi-colonial system, trying to "save the country through industry." I did not know that China has long been ruled by imperialism, and without the liberation of the people and the destruction of the exploitation system, there could be no "industry." Now, in ten years, our country has established its own steel industry, machinery manufacturing industry, automobile industry, shipbuilding industry... First of all, it is because the people themselves are masters of their own affairs, and because of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. And after the people's communes were established, the continuous improvement of the lives of more than 500 million farmers has opened up a broad road for industrial development. Thinking of the brilliant and splendid motherland today and the unlimited beautiful scenery to come, I feel comforted and proud. Under the care and help of the Party and the People's Government, I have participated in national political and economic affairs, lived happily, and found the true meaning of life. In the future, in addition to studying Chairman Mao's works hard, implementing the spirit of "leaning to one side, one-sidedly" of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Conference, and strengthening self-transformation, I will also resolutely implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, do my best to do my job well, and at the same time, be diligent and thrifty in managing the household, practice economy, and store more if there is more, and store less if there is less, fulfilling my due responsibilities. I believe that there are many and broad ways to serve socialism. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country will do their best, unite as one, and will surely be able to achieve a long-term, sustained Great Leap Forward, and continuously achieve greater victories on all fronts, accelerating the building of our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science, technology, and culture, so that the lives of the people of the whole country will be more beautiful and happy year by year. I wish the conference success and the health of all committee members.

### 努力学习，为社会主义多出一分力量  郭琳爽委员的发言

    努力学习，为社会主义多出一分力量
    郭琳爽委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及陈叔通副主席所作的全国政协常务委员会的工作报告。从这几个报告里我们可以看出：我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，紧密团结，万众一心，高举总路线大跃进和人民公社的旗帜、超额完成了1959年的国民经济计划，已经提前三年实现了第二个五年计划的主要指标。为今后长期持续大跃进，奠立了最有利的形势。
    我在这一次来开会之前，曾先后视察过上海的彭浦，长征，徐行，马桥，华漕，解放，城东，新五等人民公社，总的说来，这些公社较1958年下半年刚成立时是更加巩固和发展了。很多社已经实现“耕田不用牛、灌溉自动流”。新五人民公社拥有田地三万四千多亩，在没有建社以前，其中一万六千五百多亩的土地，地处低洼，在春秋二季是一片“白水滩”，涝灾很重，九年三熟，过去是被人遗弃的地方。自从建社之后，调动了人力物力，开辟了“送灾河”及“建设河”两条河道，把历年的涝患，改变为灌溉的水利。1959年已全部消灭“白水滩”了，做到一年三熟，也就是说，现在一年的生产量就等于过去九年收成的总和。在这个事例上，可以看到人民公社拥有雄厚的人力物力和资源，无论在耕耘收割、兴修水利、抗旱防涝、兴办工业等等各方面，都可以达到人尽其材，物尽其用，地尽其利。它的优越性是无可比拟的。
    彭浦、长征、马桥等人民公社都修建了居民点，农民们搬进了装有电灯的洁净楼房，周围设有医院、学校、食堂、敬老院、托儿所和幼儿园。大家过着有组织的幸福生活，学龄儿童及时入学，病人及时就医。妇女们从家务劳动中解放出来，愉快地从事各种生产。
    我们在城东人民公社，还看到三十二个六十二岁至八十六岁的老人，安祥地住在敬老院，过着安乐的晚年。这些集体福利，像温暖的太阳一样照到每一个人的身上，固然是由于农业生产大大增长，更重要的是由于人民公社的多种经济的经营，农林牧副渔全面开花，家禽家畜公养私养并举，就可以在生产发展的基础上，大大改善了农民的生活。如以华漕人民公社陶家桥小队三十二户人家来说，在1949年他们只有绒线衣二十五件，平均每户不到一件。在人民公社成立后大跃进的第一年，即1958年，他们共有绒线衣八十八件，平均每户有二点七件；套鞋由1949年四十六双到1958年增加到二百三十三双，钢笔由三支增加到七十支，毛衣由一件增加到十六件。其他各种衣着和日用品，在各个公社的农民家里，亦有不同程度类似的增长。在大跃进的第二年——1959年春节，公社分红以后，农民的购买力更是提高：彭浦人民公社年终分红有二百六十八户在一千元以上，这是我有生以来第一次看见的奇迹。可见在生活水平上，城乡的区别已经日见缩短，所以人民公社的社员说：“金好银好未有人民公社好，人民公社真真好，人间天堂就地造，幸福生活那里来，感谢恩人共产党”。回想旧社会所看到的农村破产、农民食不果腹、衣不蔽体的困苦情况，和今天幸福美丽的新农村情景相比，真有天渊之别。而现在农村面貌的改变，还不过正在开始，前途的美好，无穷无限。
    我在解放前就从事工商业活动凡数十年，受过帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义的重重压迫，但由于阶级性所局限，害怕革命，幻想在半封建半殖民地制度下，走资本主义道路。“实业救国”。不知道中国长期受帝国主义统治，人民不得到解放，剥削制度不受到摧毁，就不可能有什么“实业”。现在我们国家在十年间就建立起自己的钢铁业，机器制造业，汽车业，造船业，……，首先就是由于人民自己当家作主，由于党和毛主席的正确领导。而人民公社化后，五亿多农民生活的不断提高，就为工业发展开辟着广阔的道路。想到祖国今天的光辉灿烂和来日无限的美景，使我得到安慰，感到自豪。在党和人民政府的关怀和帮助下，我参予了国家政治经济事务，生活愉快，找到人生的真正意义。今后我除了努力学习毛主席的著作，贯彻全国工商联会议的“顾一头，一边倒”的精神，加强自我改造以外，并坚决执行勤俭办企业的方针，尽最大努力做好本岗位工作，同时要勤俭持家，厉行节约，本有多储多，有少储少的精神，尽一份应尽的责任。我体会为社会主义服务的道路是多方面的，很宽广的，全国人民在党和毛主席领导之下，各尽所能，众志成城，就一定能够实现长期的持续大跃进，不断在各个战线上取得更大的胜利。加速把我们国家建成为一个具有现代化工业，现代化农业和现代化科学技术文化的社会主义强国，使全国人民的生活一年比一年更为美满幸福。祝大会成功和各位委员健康。
