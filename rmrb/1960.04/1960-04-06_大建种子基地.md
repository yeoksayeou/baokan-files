    Build Seed Bases on a Large Scale

    Currently, people's communes in various localities are carrying out a massive undertaking in conjunction with spring plowing, which is the establishment of seed bases. This is an important construction for further implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and an important measure to ensure the sustained leap forward of agricultural production in the future.

    In the era of small-scale peasant economy, it was of course impossible for farmers to breed improved varieties on a large scale and in a planned way. They could only plant whatever seeds they had. After agricultural cooperation, the work of breeding improved varieties has greatly developed, but due to the small scale of cooperatives and the limited manpower and material resources, it could only be carried out on a small scale. After the people's communes were established, there was an urgent need to breed greatly increased quantities of superior varieties. Because a commune generally owns 60,000 to 70,000 mu of cultivated land, and after implementing reasonable close planting, the number of seeds generally increases by 50%. In order to increase yield per unit area, it is also necessary to select different superior varieties for different soils. This year, various localities are building high-yield plots and high-yield areas on a large scale, requiring the realization of high yields, which requires cultivating superior varieties with high yields, such as Thousand-Grain Spike (cultivated by Yang Minghan in Guangdong) and Ten-Thousand-Grain Jin (cultivated by Yang Kuangbao in Zhejiang). Therefore, it is necessary not only to cultivate and promote superior varieties that are adapted to current cultivation techniques and farming systems, but also to prepare superior varieties that can adapt to new cultivation techniques and farming systems. All of these are new tasks facing seed work. To solve such new tasks, it is obviously not feasible to rely on the small "seed plots" used during the agricultural cooperative period to breed seeds. It is also impossible to solve the seed problem of the people's communes by transferring large quantities of seeds from other places. Because transferring large quantities of seeds from other places not only causes a waste of manpower and material resources and increases the burden on transportation, but also does not guarantee the quantity, variety, and especially the quality of the seeds. Using these seeds for sowing often leads to the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Selecting seeds from commodity grain is even worse. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, which are large in scale and public in nature, and establish seed bases according to the principle of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use" to cultivate and breed a variety of superior varieties of various crops in a planned and large-scale manner; and to continuously popularize these superior varieties in production. From the situation in Heilongjiang Province, the establishment of seed bases has a significant promoting effect on the production of people's communes. In 1959, the province established various fine seed farms and seed professional teams, operating more than 7 million mu of seed fields, breeding about 1 billion jin of fine seeds, and the quality of most seeds reached the national second-class standard, meeting the needs of agricultural production in the province in 1960.

    Of course, our emphasis on establishing seed bases does not completely exclude the mutual exchange and introduction of improved varieties between regions and communes when necessary. After the establishment of seed bases, the superior varieties introduced from other places should also be tested and bred on the seed bases first, and then promoted according to the specific conditions of the local area.

    In the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, our country's popularization of improved varieties of crops has achieved great success. By 1959, the national area for the promotion of improved varieties reached 1.8 billion mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total sown area. From the perspective of the sown area of improved varieties of various crops, rice reached 90%, wheat reached 92%, cotton reached 97%, and corn and tubers reached more than 85%. This shows that the task required by the draft National Agricultural Development Program of "popularizing the existing improved varieties of various crops" before 1962 has been basically realized ahead of schedule. In the two years of 1958 and 1959, various localities also cultivated 450 new improved varieties. This is a good foundation for the establishment of seed bases. As long as we put in the same effort as we did in building water conservancy projects and producing fertilizers on a large scale, and engage in seed base work on a large scale, we will surely be able to cultivate and breed more and better improved varieties in the near future.

    The spring plowing season has arrived, and the sowing work of seed bases is imminent. People's communes in various localities should conduct serious inspections and quickly fully implement the area of seed bases, the proportion of crop planting, the measures to increase production, the production organization, etc., and complete the sowing tasks with high standards, ensuring quality and quantity. At the same time, field management should be strengthened for the fields of seed bases for overwintering crops, and we should strive for a bumper harvest of seed fields.

### 大建种子基地

    大建种子基地
    目前，各地人民公社正在结合春耕进行一项巨大的工作，就是建立种子基地。这是进一步贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的一项重要建设，也是保证今后农业生产持续跃进的一项重要措施。
    在小农经济时代，农民当然不可能大规模地有计划地繁育良种，只能有什么种什么。农业合作化以后，繁殖良种的工作有了很大的发展，但是由于合作社的规模小、人力物力有限，只能小规模地进行。人民公社化以后，迫切要求繁育数量大大增加的优良品种。因为一个公社一般拥有耕地六、七万亩，实行合理密植以后，种子数量一般的增加50％。为了提高单位面积产量，又要求不同的土壤选用不同的优良品种。今年各地大建丰产方、丰产片，要求实现高额丰产，就更要培育出像千粒穗（广东杨明汉培育）、万粒斤（浙江杨匡保培育）这样高额丰产的优良品种。所以，不仅要培育和推广适应目前耕作技术和耕作制度的优良品种，而且还要着手准备能够适应新的耕作技术和耕作制度的优良品种。所有这些都是种子工作面临着的新任务。要解决这样的新任务，依靠在农业合作社时期所采用的小块“种子地”的办法来繁育良种，显然是不行了。从外地大量调运种子来解决人民公社的种子问题也不可能。因为从外地调运大量种子，不仅造成人力物力的浪费，增加运输上的负担，而且在种子数量、品种，尤其是质量上没有保证，用这些种子播种往往发生缺苗断垅现象。从商品粮中挑选种子，更非上策。因此，解决的根本办法，就是充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，根据“自繁、自选、自留、自用”的方针，建立种子基地，有计划地、大面积地培育和繁殖各种作物的多种多样的优良品种；并且不断地把这些优良品种普及到生产中去。从黑龙江省的情况来看，建立种子基地对人民公社的生产有着重大的推进作用。这个省在1959年建立了各种良种场和种子专业队，共经营种子田地七百多万亩，繁殖良种约十亿斤，大部分种子质量达到了国家规定的二级标准，满足了这个省1960年农业生产的需要。
    当然，我们强调建立种子基地，也并不是完全排斥在必要的时候地区之间、公社之间互相交换和引用良种。建立种子基地之后，从外地引进的优良品种，也先要在种子基地上进行试验和繁殖，然后再按照本地的具体情况加以推广。
    过去几年中，特别是农业生产大跃进以来，我国的农作物优良品种的普及工作，已经获得了很大的成就。到1959年，全国良种推广面积达到十八亿亩，占播种总面积的80％以上。从各类作物的良种播种面积上来看，水稻达到90％，小麦达到92％，棉花达到97％，玉米和薯类达到85％以上。这表明，全国农业发展纲要草案所要求的在1962年前“普及各种农作物现有的优良品种”的任务，已经提前基本上实现了。在1958年和1959年两年里，各地还培育出了四百五十个新的优良品种。这是建立种子基地的良好基础。只要我们拿出大搞水利、大搞肥料那样的劲头，大搞种子基地工作，那么，不久的将来我们一定能培育繁殖出更多、更好的优良品种。
    春耕季节已经到来，种子基地的播种工作已经迫在眼前，各地人民公社应当认真进行检查，赶快把种子基地的面积、作物种植比重、增产措施、生产组织等等都必须完全落实，按照高标准，保质保量地完成播种任务。同时对于越冬作物的种子基地的田地应当加强田间管理，争取种子田地的大丰收。
