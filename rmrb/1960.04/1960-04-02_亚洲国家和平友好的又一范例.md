Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 1st: According to reports from Kathmandu, King Mahendra of Nepal stated on March 31st, while discussing Prime Minister Koirala's recent visits to China and India, that these visits strengthened the friendship between Nepal and these two countries.

He also expressed gratitude for the increased economic aid to Nepal from the Soviet Union, China, and India, and expressed hope that the increased aid would accelerate Nepal's development process.

The King outlined the achievements and policies of the Nepalese government in a speech to a joint session of both houses of parliament. He reiterated Nepal's policy of neutrality, stating that the Nepalese government would continue to pursue a policy of non-alignment.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 31st: Kathmandu News: Nepalese newspapers warmly welcomed the Sino-Nepalese Joint Communiqué, the Sino-Nepalese Boundary Treaty, and the Economic Aid Agreement.

The "Independent News" editorial on the 27th stated that the Joint Communiqué was welcome. "The communiqué further strengthens the friendship between China and Nepal and promotes the cause of world peace."

Regarding the Boundary Treaty, the editorial said, "The consensus to establish a joint committee to scientifically demarcate the boundary line is very welcome."

Referring to the Aid Agreement, the editorial said, "Economic assistance from friendly countries is enabling our country to progress. Due to a lack of funds and industry, we face many difficulties. China has expressed its deep friendship by providing us with unconditional aid of one hundred million Indian rupees." The editorial said, "What is even more satisfactory is that if the aid is not fully utilized within the prescribed time limit, the validity of the agreement can be extended."

The editorial said, "Every Nepalese is delighted that Zhou Enlai agreed to visit Nepal. We hope that he will receive a heartfelt welcome, just as our Prime Minister received in Beijing."

The editorial also welcomed the establishment of a Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu.

The "Ideal Newspaper" editorial on the 27th stated, "We believe that this Joint Communiqué enhances our country's interests, and at the same time, it can contribute to world peace." It said, "There is no doubt that China hopes to resolve all issues with its neighbors through peaceful and friendly discussions. This Joint Communiqué will have an impact on the Sino-Indian border dispute." The newspaper pointed out that if Nepal and China—two countries with different social and political systems—can live together harmoniously, then there is no reason why other Asian countries cannot coexist peacefully and friendly with China.

The editorial said that the Sino-Nepalese Boundary Treaty "adds a new chapter to the history of relations between the two countries." "The agreement stipulates that neither party will send armed personnel to within twenty kilometers of its side of the border, which strengthens the hope of making the Sino-Nepalese border a border of lasting peace." The editorial pointed out that no incidents have occurred in the border areas between Nepal and China, and the Sino-Nepalese Boundary Treaty is "an example worthy of emulation by other countries."

Referring to China's economic assistance, the editorial said, "This money will greatly help Nepal's rapid development." Prime Minister Koirala has expressed gratitude for this selfless assistance.

The editorial said, "The Chinese government, with the lofty desire to maintain lasting peace between Nepal and China and to consolidate friendship," proposed concluding a treaty of peace and friendship, and Premier Zhou Enlai will visit Nepal and sign a treaty of peace and friendship, thereby further strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. "The friendship between China and Nepal will continue to develop on the basis of Panchsheel."

The editorial said that the establishment of embassies in each other's countries will help to enhance friendly relations through the strengthening of direct contact.
