This dispatch from Tianjin, April 1st reports: Recently, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee has made specific arrangements for technical innovation and technical revolution, requiring that factories and mines above the county level basically eliminate heavy manual labor in jobs such as搬运 (bānyùn) carrying, 装卸 (zhuāngxiè) loading and unloading, 起重 (qǐzhòng) lifting, 采掘 (cǎijué) mining, 破碎 (pòsuì) crushing, 铸造 (zhùzào) casting, and 锻铆 (duànmǎo) forging and riveting in the first half of this year, achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization. It also requires Party committees at all levels to take technical innovation and technical revolution as the guiding principle, continue to carry out large-scale campaigns for increasing production and practicing economy, and further integrate technical innovation and technical revolution with production, so that all innovative achievements can quickly produce practical results in production.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front in Hebei Province has driven the overall leap forward of the entire industrial front, achieving multiple benefits. Production capacity has increased by multiples, even tens or hundreds of times, and the province's total industrial output value has already completed the first quarter's task twelve days ahead of schedule. Currently, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage of comprehensive technical transformation centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization.

The movement has achieved significant results in a short period of time mainly because Party committees at all levels have implemented the Party's General Line, adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, and launched a vigorous mass movement. The specific methods used include the following experiences:

First, the spearhead of technical innovation and technical revolution is first directed at heavy manual labor and manual operations that consume the most labor, as well as departments and weak links that are decisive for ensuring continued leap forward in production this year. Different industries have identified different priorities. Transportation is the weakest link in realizing this year's production leap forward plan, and the most realistic way to improve transportation capacity is to improve transportation efficiency. Therefore, the greatest effort is made to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading. In Tianjin, in just over a month, after five concentrated campaigns, railway freight yards, automobile transportation freight yards, and factories with a daily transportation volume of more than 30 tons in the city have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, and the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization has rapidly increased from 20% to over 80%. A large increase in coal production is the key to continuing the leap forward this year, and the biggest problem in increasing coal production is the shortage of pit props and labor. Therefore, the entire province's coal front is vigorously promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal hewing, prop transportation, pit prop loading and unloading, coal yard loading and unloading, and coal slime excavation. Major coal mines have now basically achieved this, and have created 21 kinds of substitutes for pit props. Kailuan, Jingxing and other coal mines have adopted new coal mining methods and have achieved seven unmanned, pit-propless working faces. After these experiences were rapidly and universally promoted throughout the province, the problem of insufficient pit props and labor was solved, ensuring increased production without increasing manpower. Other industries, such as metallurgy, machinery, textile, chemical, and light industry, have also grasped different priorities for technical transformation based on the production needs of their respective industries. The advantage of doing so is that the goals are clear, the strength is concentrated, it is easy to achieve, and it is closely integrated with production, saving both manpower and material resources, and ensuring the continued leap forward of production.

Second, different priorities are determined for technical innovation and technical revolution based on the different characteristics of large, medium and small cities. Tianjin is a comprehensive large old industrial city mainly based on machinery, chemical industry, and light industry. The focus of technical innovation and technical revolution is to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, and carry out comprehensive technical transformation while striving to develop in the direction of high precision and advanced technology. Medium-sized cities such as Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding focus on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and realize automation and semi-automation according to the conditions, gradually carrying out comprehensive transformation of production technology to improve production capacity, especially increasing the production of raw materials, reducing consumption, increasing varieties, and supporting agricultural technical transformation. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in county and commune industries is even more prominently centered on supporting agricultural technical transformation, vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations and heavy manual labor, and vigorously promoting the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products.

Third, vigorously grasp communist-style large-scale collaboration, and give full play to the superiority of socialist relations of production to ensure the high-speed development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. During this period, collaboration offices were generally established from the province to the city, and communist-style large-scale collaboration has greatly developed in terms of content, form and scale. It has not only broken the boundaries between factories and industries, but also developed into large-scale collaboration between industry, agriculture and commerce. More than 2,000 faculty members and researchers from various universities and scientific research institutions in Tianjin have gone deep into factories to help more than 100 units achieve more than 200 innovative projects. In the past two months, more than 200 collaborative meetings of various forms have been held throughout the city, solving more than 3,000 technical key problems and allocating 2,600 tons of materials and 2,600 sets of equipment.

Fourth, ideological revolution, technical revolution, cultural revolution, and production organization revolution promote each other and develop in combination. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement not only promotes the great development of productive forces, but also causes a series of profound changes in the relations of production and the superstructure. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the vast number of workers have greatly promoted the working class’s spirit of continuous revolution and the communist style of daring to think, speak and act. “Everyone makes suggestions, and innovation is carried out everywhere” has become a common practice. People’s collective consciousness has been greatly strengthened, and the communist collaborative style has greatly developed. The further improvement of the ideological awareness of workers has promoted the rapid development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has also promoted the advent of the cultural revolution upsurge. Workers’ demands for learning culture and technology are now more urgent than in the past. The attendance rate of Tianjin City’s workers’ spare-time schools has reached over 90%. Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution has also caused a series of changes in labor organization and enterprise management. With the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Tianjin Shoe Factory conducts adjustments and reforms to labor organization, production organization and enterprise management system every half month, continuously organizes new balances, gives full play to the effect of innovation and creation, and ensures that the production plan is greatly overfulfilled and product quality continues to remain stable and improve.

In order to promote the high-speed development of the movement, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee recently put forward the following requirements for technical innovation and technical revolution:

(1) There should be both long-term plans and short-term arrangements, with specific requirements and specific measures for a certain period of time. In the first half of this year, enterprises above the county level should concentrate their efforts, use the method of fighting annihilation battles in batches and phases, and strive to eliminate heavy manual labor in jobs such as carrying, loading and unloading, lifting, mining, crushing, casting, and forging and riveting, and basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations by the end of the year.

(2) Actively grasp the matching and integration and promotion of advanced experiences. Each region and each industrial department should grasp the existing advanced experiences for selection and finalization, so that they can be matched and integrated, and fully promoted before "May Day" to make significant achievements, and truly achieve "one factory succeeds, every factory promotes," and continuously expand the achievements of the technical revolution and achieve large-scale harvests. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is still led by the local party committee. At present, the guiding role of each industrial department should be brought into full play, grasp the advanced experiences of great significance to the industry, quickly formulate new plans, and take effective measures to promote them.

(3) Take technical innovation and technical revolution as the guiding principle, continue to carry out large-scale campaigns to increase production and practice economy, and further integrate technical innovation and technical revolution with production, so that all innovative achievements can quickly produce practical results in production. In the iron and steel industry, we must continue to vigorously carry out the "two, five, nine" campaign, requiring that all blast furnaces in the province generally reach this level before "May Day". The coal industry must continue to carry out large-scale high-yield campaigns, and achieve an average monthly output of more than 18,000 tons for retreat mining operations by the end of the second quarter. The machinery industry must widely carry out the "doubling" campaign, to achieve "one person is equivalent to two people, and one factory is equivalent to several factories," and at the same time, strive to improve quality, reduce consumption, and increase varieties. In terms of automobile transportation, we must vigorously promote the "ten thousand ton-kilometers per ton per month" campaign, and quickly realize the ten thousand ton-kilometers province. Other departments must propose specific goals based on needs, so that the technical revolution is closely integrated with production.

(4) With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, management work such as adjusting labor organization, reforming rules and regulations, and improving wage and reward methods must keep up in order to promote the continuous progress of the technical revolution movement. The Provincial Party Committee requires that each department and bureau conduct in-depth investigations and research based on the new situations and new problems that arise in management work, formulate solutions, require each department and bureau to select key points, summarize experiences, and promote them.

(5) To meet the needs of the technical revolution movement, run spare-time cultural and technical schools on a large scale. Implement factory and mine-run schools, widely carry out mass technical learning activities, rapidly improve the cultural and technical level of workers, and plan to train and promote a group of engineering and technical personnel from workers, and continuously strengthen the technical team.

(6) Emphasize self-reliance, and adopt the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to solve the problems of raw materials and equipment needed for technical innovation and technical revolution. The purpose of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is to both increase production and save resources. A part of the raw materials increased and saved can be used for technical revolution. Each region and each industrial department should also organize the allocation of raw materials within the region and industry. Key equipment urgently needed in the technical revolution should be planned for production.

Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in leading the vast number of cadres and masses to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, adhere to continuous revolution, continuously overcome various right-leaning conservative thoughts, inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of masses, and promote the sustained development of the great technical revolution movement.

    向技术革命新目标前进
    河北省委要求上半年基本消灭笨重体力劳动
    本报天津1日电　最近，中共河北省委对技术革新和技术革命又作了具体安排，要求县营以上的厂矿企业，在今年上半年基本上消灭搬运、装卸、起重、采掘、破碎、铸造、锻铆等工种的笨重体力劳动，实现机械化半机械化。并要求各级党委要以技术革新和技术革命为纲，继续开展大规模的增产节约运动，使技术革新和技术革命与生产进一步密切结合，使一切革新成果迅速在生产上取得实效。
    河北省工业战线的技术革新和技术革命运动，带动了整个工业战线的全面跃进，收到了一箭多雕的效果。生产能力成倍地甚至成十倍、成百倍提高，全省工业总产值，已经提前十二天完成首季任务。目前技术革新和技术革命运动已进入到机械化半机械化为中心的全面技术改造的新阶段。
    运动所以能在短期内收到显著效果，主要是各级党委贯彻执行了党的总路线，坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的方针。在具体作法上有以下经验：
    一、技术革新和技术革命的矛头首先指向耗用劳力最多的笨重体力劳动和手工操作，以及对保证今年生产继续跃进有决定意义的部门和薄弱环节。不同行业确定了不同的重点。交通运输是实现今年生产跃进计划的最薄弱的环节，而提高运输能力的最现实的办法，是提高运输效率，因此，就以最大的力量实现装卸搬运的机械化半机械化。天津市在一个多月内，经过五次突击战役，全市各个铁路货场、汽车运输货场和日运量在三十吨以上的工厂，就基本上实现了装卸搬运的机械化半机械化，机械化半机械化水平迅速由20％提高到80％以上。大量增产煤炭是今年继续跃进的关键，而增产煤的最大问题是坑木和劳力不足。因此，全省煤炭战线大搞攉煤、运柱、坑木装卸、煤场装卸、挖煤泥机械化半机械化，现在重点煤矿都已基本实现，并且创造了二十一种坑木代用品。开滦、井陉等煤矿采用新的采煤方法，已实现七个无人、无坑木工作面。这些经验迅速在全省普遍推广以后，解决了坑木和劳力不足的问题，保证了增产不增人。其他如冶金、机械、纺织、化工、轻工等行业也都根据本行业生产需要，抓住了不同重点进行技术改造。这样作的好处是：目标明确，力量集中，易于实现，并与生产紧密结合，既节约人力、物力，又保证了生产的继续跃进。
    二、根据大、中、小城市不同特点。对技术革新和技术革命确定不同重点。天津是一个机械、化工、轻工为主的综合性的大型老工业城市，技术革新和技术革命的重点是：大搞机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化，进行全面技术改造的同时，努力向高精尖的方向发展。唐山、石家庄、保定等中等城市则以机械化半机械化为重点，根据条件实现自动化半自动化，逐步进行生产技术的全面改造，提高生产能力，特别是增加原材料生产，降低消耗，增加品种，支援农业的技术改造。县、社工业的技术革新和技术革命运动更是突出地以支援农业技术改造为中心，大搞手工操作和笨重体力劳动机械化半机械化，大搞农副产品加工和综合利用。
    三、大抓共产主义大协作，充分发挥社会主义生产关系的优越性，保证技术革新和技术革命运动高速度发展。这一时期，从省到市普遍成立了协作办公室，共产主义大协作不论在内容上、形式上和规模上都有了很大发展。不仅已打破各厂之间、各行业之间的界线，而且发展到工农商业之间的大协作。天津各高等学校、科学研究机关已有二千多人深入到工厂，帮助一百多个单位突击实现了二百多个革新项目。两个月来，全市召开了各种不同形式的协作会议二百多次，解决了技术关键三千多项，调剂材料二千六百吨、设备二千六百台。
    四、思想革命、技术革命、文化革命、生产组织革命，互相促进结合发展。技术革新和技术革命运动不仅促使生产力大发展，而且也引起了生产关系、上层建筑的一系列的深刻变化。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，广大职工大大发扬了工人阶级的不断革命精神，和敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。“人人提建议，处处搞革新”，已经成为普遍风气。人们的集体观念大为加强，共产主义协作风格大大发展。职工思想觉悟的进一步提高，又推动着技术革新和技术革命运动迅速发展。技术革新和技术革命运动的发展也促进了文化革命高潮的到来。工人学习文化和技术的要求现在比过去更加迫切。天津市职工业余学校出勤率达到90％以上。大搞技术革新和技术革命也引起了劳动组织企业管理一系列的变化。天津制鞋厂随着技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，每半个月就进行一次劳动组织、生产组织和企业管理制度的调整和改革工作，不断地组织新的平衡，使革新创造的效果得到充分发挥，保证了生产计划大大超额完成，产品质量也继续保持稳定和有所提高。
    为了推动运动高速度发展，最近中共河北省委对技术革新和技术革命，提出了以下几点要求：
    （一）既要有长期规划，又要有短期安排，有一定时间的具体要求和具体措施。今年上半年，县以上企业要集中力量，用分批分期打歼灭战的办法，力争消灭搬运、装卸、起重、采掘、破碎、铸造、锻铆等工种的笨重体力劳动，在年底以前基本实现手工操作机械化半机械化。
    （二）积极抓紧先进经验的配套成龙和推广工作。各个地区、各个产业部门应该抓紧已有的先进经验进行选型定型，使之配套成龙，“五一”以前要全面推广，作出显著成绩，确实做到“一厂成功、厂厂推广”，不断扩大技术革命成果，取得大面积丰收。开展技术革新技术革命运动仍以地方党委领导为主，在当前要充分发挥各产业部门的指导作用，抓住对本行业有重大意义的先进经验，迅速制订新的规划，采取切实措施加以推广。
    （三）以技术革新和技术革命为纲，继续开展大规模的增产节约运动，使技术革新和技术革命与生产进一步密切结合，使一切革新成果迅速在生产上取得实效。在炼铁行业，要继续大力开展“二、五、九”运动，要求“五一”以前全省高炉普遍达到这个水平。煤炭工业要继续开展大面积高额丰产运动，二季度末要实现回采工作平均月产一万八千吨以上。机械工业要广泛开展“翻番”运动，做到“一人顶二人、一厂顶数厂”，同时要努力提高质量，降低消耗，增加品种。汽车运输方面要大搞“车吨月产万吨公里”运动，迅速实现万吨公里省。其他部门，都要根据需要，提出具体奋斗目标，使技术革命和生产密切结合起来。
    （四）随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，调整劳动组织，改革规章制度，改进工资奖励办法等管理工作，必须跟上，以便促进技术革命运动不断前进。省委要求各厅局根据管理工作中出现的新情况新问题，深入调查研究，制定解决方案，要求各厅局，选择重点，总结经验，加以推广。
    （五）适应技术革命运动的需要，大办业余的文化技术学校。实行厂矿办学，广泛开展群众性技术学习活动，迅速提高职工的文化技术水平，有计划地培养提拔一批工人出身的工程技术人员，不断壮大技术队伍。
    （六）强调自力更生，采取土洋结合的办法解决技术革新和技术革命所需要的原材料和设备问题。技术革新技术革命运动的目的是既要增产又要节约，增产节约的原材料可以拿出一部分用于技术革命。各地区和各产业部门也要在本地区、本产业内组织原材料的调剂工作。技术革命中所迫切需要的关键性设备，要有计划地安排生产。
    加强党的领导是技术革新和技术革命运动不断深入发展的根本保证，各级领导干部要以身作则带动广大干部群众认真学习毛主席著作，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，坚持不断革命，不断地克服形形色色的右倾保守思想，鼓舞广大群众的革命热情，促进伟大的技术革命运动持续地向前发展。
