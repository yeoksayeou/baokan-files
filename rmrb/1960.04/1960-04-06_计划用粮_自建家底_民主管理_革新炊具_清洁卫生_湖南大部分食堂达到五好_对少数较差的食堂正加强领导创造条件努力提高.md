    Planned Grain Use, Building Up Family Assets, Democratic Management, Kitchen Utensil Innovation, Cleanliness and Hygiene
    Most Canteens in Hunan Achieve Five Goods
    Strengthening Leadership and Creating Conditions to Improve the Few Poorer Canteens
    (Our Report) Hunan Province has 417,000+ rural public canteens, which are getting better and better. 70% of the canteens have achieved the "five goods" standard: Planned grain use ensures commune members eat their fill and eat well; sufficient firewood and vegetables, the canteen is self-sufficient in oil and salt money, and raises pigs, chickens, ducks and fish well; kitchen utensils are innovated, saving manpower and material resources well; cleanliness and hygiene prevent disease, and commune members are healthy; democratic management, convenient for commune members, promotes unity and friendship.
    There are currently 417,000+ canteens in the province, all of which are year-round canteens. The population participating in the canteens accounts for more than 99% of the rural population, and more than 95% of the canteens are very consolidated. Among them, 70% have reached the "five goods" canteen standard. Another 20% have reached or basically reached "four goods". The remaining canteens are strengthening leadership, creating conditions, and working hard to improve and strive for "five goods".
    Rural public canteens have played an important role in consolidating and developing the people's communes: the province has liberated more than four million female laborers. In the past, the number of people regularly working in agriculture was 12 million, now it has reached more than 16 million. Planned grain use has been effectively implemented, and people's lives have been better arranged. Although Hunan suffered a hundred-day drought last year, the lives of the masses were very stable, they ate their fill, ate frugally, and ate well, and their enthusiasm for production continued to rise. The canteen has also driven the great development of various collective living and welfare undertakings in rural areas, and the role of the people's commune as an organizer of collective production and collective life has been further enhanced. Canteens across the province have set up more than 400,000 part-time health workers to prevent diseases for commune members. Therefore, the incidence of infectious diseases in the province this year has decreased by nine-tenths compared to before. The province has also established 340,000 nurseries centered on the canteens. The canteen also makes it convenient for kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly in terms of life. Some canteens have already organized shoe-making, laundry, sewing, etc., to socialize housework. Hunan's canteens are generally one hall serving as four halls - dining hall, meeting hall, classroom, and entertainment hall. This makes meetings convenient, the number of people participating in various social activities has increased unprecedentedly, and learning is also very convenient. More than 87% of young and middle-aged people in the province participate in learning. The countryside is full of a new scene of prosperity and well-being, with everyone being strong, in a cheerful mood, having work and leisure.
    The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the main experiences in running rural public canteens well as follows:
    (1) Strengthening the Party's leadership over life is the key to running public canteens well. Since 99% of the rural population eats in canteens, the central link in caring for the lives of the masses is to actively run collective living and welfare undertakings centered on the canteens. Therefore, from the provincial party committee to the rural party branches, when resolutely implementing the policy of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," they all focus on the canteen. Each local committee, county committee, and commune party committee has a secretary in charge of the canteen. Party committees above the county level have also established administrative agencies to manage collective life and welfare. A large number of responsible comrades from party committees at all levels also go deep into the canteens to "cultivate experimental plots," serve as cooks, and be grassroots cadres, eating with commune members, which further strengthens the relationship between cadres and the masses. At the same time, the provincial party committee, in the spirit of "grasping several times a year," convened four canteen work conferences in 1959 to summarize and exchange experiences, study and resolve problems such as improving canteen management, establishing housekeeping, and solving oil, salt, firewood and vegetables. Party committees at all levels also specifically grasp canteen work once every one or two months, so that the canteen continues to move forward.
    (2) Unified management of grain is an extremely important experience in consolidating and improving canteens in Hunan Province. Now, the province uniformly implements the system of "unified management, physical distribution to the canteen, fixed quantity per person, quotas to households, and surpluses belong to oneself." Therefore, 98.6% of the canteens in the province use grain completely according to the fixed quantity plan, and 70% of the canteens have surplus grain.
    (3) Establishing the canteen's collective "small family affairs" and comprehensively arranging oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables is also an important experience in running the canteen well. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted a policy of active support for the canteen's "small family affairs." Since the spring of last year, the provincial party committee has vigorously called for and organized the canteen to raise pigs, plant feed land, and grow vegetables to solve the canteen's oil, salt, firewood, and vegetable money. Now, rural public canteens across the province have more than two million mu of permanent fixed vegetable land. The canteens also use winter fallow fields and open spaces to grow vegetables. More than 90% of the canteens can eat an average of two kilograms of vegetables per person per day. Some canteens can eat dried vegetables and pickled vegetables for a year. At the end of last year, the number of pigs raised in canteens was 5,370,000, an average of more than ten per canteen. In addition to self-consumption, a large number of pigs are sold to the state. In addition, many canteens also raise chickens, ducks, fish, etc. According to statistics from 200,000 canteens, 74% have achieved self-sufficiency in oil, salt, firewood, vegetables, cooking utensils, and management fees, and some canteens have surpluses. This year, the provincial party committee has also made a plan to appropriately develop the canteen's "small family affairs," requiring an average of one pig to be raised for every five, six, seven, or eight people, and one chicken and duck for every two people. In this way, all the expenses of the canteen can not only be self-sufficient but also have a surplus, and the canteen can gradually carry out some basic construction.
    (4) To run the canteen well, it is also necessary to plant red flags, set up pace-setters, and carry out mass movements. The public canteens in Hunan Province have been continuously consolidated and improved in the mass movement. Not long after the canteenization, the province relied on the masses to conduct a comprehensive rectification. Last winter, combined with the rectification of the commune, another rectification was carried out. During the rectification, the canteen resolutely established the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants, selected a group of managers and cooks with good composition, high awareness, selflessness, democratic style, and enthusiasm for social undertakings, and established democratic management committees and various systems. At the same time, the provincial party committee also continuously planted red flags, set up pace-setters, and carried out large-scale comparison and competition. Last winter and this spring, combined with the rectification of the commune, the experiences of advanced canteens were summarized, and the "five goods" standards for running canteens well were formulated. After discussions by 30 million people participating in the commune rectification movement, a "five goods" canteen competition movement was launched throughout the province, setting off a mass communist collaboration competition in which backward canteens catch up with advanced ones, and advanced canteens help backward ones. On this basis, the provincial party committee convened a collective welfare undertaking heroes' meeting attended by 1,600 people, setting up 800 provincial pace-setting canteens, which greatly promoted the consolidation and development of the canteen.
    The mass movement of technical innovation in the canteen has also been vigorously launched, and now a complete set of native mechanical cooking utensils has been created. Including rice milling, water use, rice measuring, vegetable washing, vegetable cutting, stove type, food delivery, heat preservation, dishwashing and other tools. 40% of the canteens in the province have improved the stove type, 30% of the canteens have realized self-flowing water, 15% of the canteens have semi-mechanized vegetable cutting, a small number of canteens have been fully mechanized with native methods, and a total of 1.13 million other cooking utensils have been reformed, saving manpower and material resources to support production.

    计划用粮  自建家底  民主管理  革新炊具  清洁卫生
    湖南大部分食堂达到五好
    对少数较差的食堂正加强领导创造条件努力提高
    本报讯　湖南省四十一万七千多个农村公共食堂，越办越好，已有70％的食堂做到了计划用粮、社员吃得饱、吃得好；柴、菜充足，油盐钱食堂自给，猪鸡鸭鱼养得好；炊具革新，节省人力物力好；清洁卫生，防止疾病，社员身体好；民主管理，方便社员，团结友爱好的“五好”标准。
    全省农村现共有四十一万七千多个食堂，全部是常年食堂，参加食堂的人口占农村人口的99％以上，已经很巩固的食堂占95％以上，其中达到“五好”食堂标准的占70％。还有20％的食堂，达到或基本达到了“四好”。其余的食堂正加强领导，创造条件，努力提高，争取“五好”。
    农村公共食堂在巩固和发展人民公社中发挥了重要作用：全省解放了四百多万个妇女劳动力，过去农业上经常出工的人数是一千二百来万，现在达到一千六百多万。计划用粮得到切实贯彻，人民的生活也就得到更好的安排。去年湖南虽然遭百日大旱，但群众的生活十分安定，吃得饱，吃得省，吃得好，生产干劲不断高涨。食堂还带动了农村各种集体生活福利事业的大发展，人民公社集体生产、集体生活组织者的作用得到更大的发挥。全省食堂设了四十多万个兼职保健员，给社员预防疾病。因此，今年全省传染病发病率比以前降低了十分之九。全省还以食堂为中心办了三十四万个托儿所。食堂还使幼儿园、妇产院、敬老院得到生活上的方便。一部分食堂已经组织作鞋、洗衣、缝补等，使家务劳动社会化。湖南省食堂一般又是一堂作四堂——食堂、会堂、课堂、娱乐堂。这样，开会方便，参加各种社会活动的人数空前增加，学习也很方便，全省参加学习的占青壮年的87％以上。农村到处是人人身体强壮、心情舒畅、有劳有逸，一片繁荣安康的新景象。
    中共湖南省委总结了办好农村公共食堂的几条主要经验是：
    （一）加强党对生活的领导，是办好公共食堂的关键。农村有99％的人口在食堂吃饭，关心群众生活的中心环节，就是要积极办好以食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业。因此，从省委到农村党支部，在坚决贯彻执行“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的方针时，都以食堂为中心。各地委、县委、公社党委都有一个书记抓食堂。县以上党委还成立了管理集体生活福利的办事机构。大批各级党委负责同志还深入到食堂“种试验田”、当炊事员、基层干部，和社员一起吃饭，更加密切干群关系。同时，省委本着“一年抓几次”的精神，在1959年召开了四次食堂工作会议，总结交流经验，研究和解决了食堂改善经营管理，建立家务、解决油盐柴菜等问题。各级党委也每一、两个月就专门抓一次食堂工作，使食堂不断前进。
    （二）统一管理粮食，是湖南省在巩固提高食堂中一条极为重要的经验。现在，全省一律实行了“统一管理，实物到堂，以人定量，指标到户，节余归己”的制度。因此，全省现有98.6％的食堂完全按照定量计划用粮，有70％的食堂做到有节余粮。
    （三）建立食堂的集体“小家务”，全面安排油、盐、柴、菜，也是办好食堂的一条重要经验。中共湖南省委对于食堂的“小家务”采取了积极支持的方针。从去年春季起，省委大力号召和组织食堂养猪、种饲料地、种蔬菜的工作，以解决食堂的油盐柴菜钱。现在全省农村公共食堂有常年固定菜地二百多万亩，食堂还利用冬闲田和空地种菜，90％以上的食堂，每人每天平均吃到两斤蔬菜，有的食堂干菜和腌菜可以吃一年。去年年底食堂养猪的存栏数是五百三十七万头，平均每个食堂有十多头，除自食以外，还有大量的猪卖给国家。此外，许多食堂还养了鸡、鸭、鱼等，据二十万个食堂的统计，已经作到油盐柴菜和炊具费、管理费自给的占74％，一部分食堂还有节余。今年省委还作出了适当地发展食堂的“小家务”计划，要求平均每五、六人，七、八人养一头猪，每两人一只鸡鸭。这样，食堂的一切费用，不仅可以自给而且有余，还可以使食堂逐步搞一些基本建设。
    （四）办好食堂还必须插红旗、树标兵、大搞群众运动。湖南省公共食堂是在大搞群众运动中，不断巩固提高的。食堂化不久，全省就依靠群众进行了一次全面整顿。去年冬季结合整社又进行了一次整顿。在整顿中使食堂坚决地树立起贫农、下中农的领导优势，挑选出了一批成分好、觉悟高、大公无私、作风民主、热心社会事业的管理人员和炊事人员，并建立民主管理委员会和各项制度。同时，省委还不间断地插红旗、树标兵，大搞评比竞赛。全省去冬今春结合整社，总结了先进食堂的经验，拟定了办好食堂的“五好”标准，经过参加整社运动的三千万人的讨论，在全省范围开展了“五好”食堂竞赛运动，掀起了落后赶先进、先进帮后进食堂的群众性的共产主义大协作竞赛。在这基础上，省委召开了一千六百人参加的集体福利事业群英大会，树立了八百个全省的标兵食堂，大大地推动了食堂巩固和发展。
    食堂的技术革新的群众运动也蓬勃地展开，现在已经创造了一整套土机械炊具。包括碾米、用水、量米、洗菜、切菜、灶型、送饭、保温、洗碗等工具。全省有40％的食堂改良了灶型，有30％的食堂实现用水自流化，15％的食堂切菜半机械化，一小部分食堂已全部土机械化，共改革其他炊具一百一十三万件，做到节省人力物力，支援生产。
