Scientific Research Institutions Should Cultivate Professional Talent
Speech by Wang Daheng, Member of the CPPCC National Committee

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Strive to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule" report, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Report on the Work of The Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and guarantee to implement them in my work.

I am a scientific and technological worker. My unit is the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Instruments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the "Optical Machinery Institute"). Since its establishment in 1953, under the wise leadership of the Party, the Optical Machinery Institute has made great achievements in scientific research. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, research work has seen even more rapid development.

At the same time, in addition to liberating thinking and fully mobilizing positive factors, the Optical Machinery Institute is using the established scientific and technological foundation to establish universities and expand experimental factories while adhering to the principle of focusing on scientific research. This forms a "three-in-one" combination of research as the main focus (one main) and running education and factories as auxiliary (two auxiliary). So far, this "three-in-one" combination has seen good results. It can be said to be a path to fully utilize scientific and technological forces, serve socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, and leap towards the peak of science.

Now I would like to say more about the experience of the Optical Machinery Institute in running universities. The Optical Machinery Institute runs a full-time polytechnic college - the Optical Precision Machinery College. This college has been operating for nearly two years and has more than 500 students. It is also China's first specialized college specializing in optical precision machinery. Since its establishment, although it has experienced many difficulties, due to putting politics in command, with the firm determination and confidence to run the college, to run it well and to run it for a long time, now this college has not only been established, but it is also running well, and it will definitely run better and better in the future.

The experience since the Great Leap Forward tells us that in order to rapidly catch up with the world's advanced level in science and technology and climb the peak of science, we must rapidly establish a sufficient and strong scientific and technological force in this major, so that the research work in this science can be fully developed, and all aspects of the research work can coordinate and promote each other, thereby accelerating the research speed and ensuring that the research results obtained are both quantitative and qualitative. In terms of the training of specialized talent in optical precision machinery, in the years after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, many universities have established majors related to optics and precision machinery, and have trained a considerable number of specialized talent. They have played a positive role in establishing China's optical industry. Since the Great Leap Forward, China's optical industry, like other construction fronts, is developing at an unprecedented speed, so the need for professional talent is even more urgent. At present, the training of optical machinery talent cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of the industry. This situation is even more true for specialized research institutions. The number of university graduates that can be assigned each year is far from the number needed. In particular, some university graduates, after coming to the research institute, due to past training, are not specifically trained to engage in research work, or the nature of the major is not exactly the same as the research work to be engaged in. They often have to go through a period of familiarization and learning after coming to the research institute. Faced with this situation, the Party Committee of the Optical Machinery Institute, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, realized that scientific and technological bases like research institutes should take cultivating professional talent and strengthening the scientific team as a basic responsibility. Only by shouldering the task of training can we better solve the problem of the large number of scientific research cadres needed in the future.

Running a university in a research institute will naturally make the work more intense. However, in order to establish China's first polytechnic college of this kind, and in order to be able to train a large number of suitable scientific and technological research cadres in the near future, what does it matter if it is more intense now? As long as the college is established, it will not only further promote the development of the research institute, but the college itself will also have a bright future because it is of great significance to socialist construction.

Due to the correct leadership of the Party, first of all, with the strong support of the Party and higher authorities, this college adheres to putting politics in command, "the whole institute runs the college"; adheres to launching mass movements on a large scale, teachers and students run the college together; and implements the Party's education policy and fully utilizes the "three-in-one" characteristics of the research institute, and has been established from scratch, from simple to complete. It can be said that the academic performance of the students in the college is now no lower than that of universities with a very good foundation.

When the college was first established, in order to offer basic courses, a part of the research staff in the institute was transferred to be full-time teachers. When the students had already arrived, but the laboratory was still being prepared, the houses were still lacking, and the students had to sleep on the floor and eat in sheds, there were some conservative views. Some doubted whether the research institute could run a college. This is the "cannot run" argument. Some thought that running a college was to solve the current urgent need for cadres. They regarded the college as a training class, which was temporary in nature. Once the students graduated, the task would be completed. This is the "cannot run for long" argument. There was also this idea that research institutes should focus on research and should not put energy into teaching, so they were afraid of "not running well." It can be said that those who hold these right-leaning conservative ideas only talk about things as they are, and do not see the development of things and the interconnectedness between things. When the college was first established, the scientific and technological strength of the Optical Machinery Institute was indeed limited and bore the burden of intense and heavy research tasks. It must be seen that the strength of the Optical Machinery Institute itself is not stagnant. In the process of engaging in research work with great leaps and full enthusiasm, the scientific and technological level is rapidly improving, and the strength is also constantly growing rapidly. Then, as time goes on, it will be fully possible to assume the teaching ability required for the growing and consolidating of the college. The Party promptly refuted those right-leaning conservative arguments, laying the ideological foundation for running the college well. The facts have irrefutably given a powerful counterattack to this right-leaning view.

In the spirit of relying mainly on self-reliance, the Party organization relied on the masses and proposed to "run the college throughout the institute." The researchers in the institute, from the director, senior researchers, and many young scientific and technical personnel, were mobilized to take on the teaching work of the college. Of course, this was carried out without affecting the implementation of the scientific research plan. They also participated in discussions on various policies and teaching plans of the college. In the establishment of laboratory equipment, the college also received support from the entire institute. Students also participated in the establishment of laboratories and internship workshops during their labor production training time. Some students also participated in the compilation and selection of teaching materials. This has formed a situation of "teachers and students running the college together."

In the close three-way combination of scientific research, education, and production, it is felt that running a college in a research institute has the following characteristics:
	(1) Because the training objectives of the college are very clear, the majors and courses offered in the college can be completely combined with the specific needs of the research institute in the next few years of development, and the teaching plan can be formulated according to the needs of the time. The content of the courses can be more meticulously organized to improve teaching efficiency and avoid superfluous parts and unnecessary repetitions. For example, when conducting mechanical drawing courses, the structure, parts, and components of optical instruments are directly surveyed and mapped, so that the mechanical drawing course and the course on optical instrument structure parts can be combined into one. Many specific work contents of the research institute can also be appropriately incorporated into the courses, so that students can master advanced knowledge in a timely manner. A very important point is to make students live in the environment of future work during the learning era.
	(2) Except for a part of the research staff who need to focus on teaching in order to offer basic theoretical courses, all kinds of professional courses can be taught by professional scientific and technical personnel in the institute. In this way, workers regard training new forces as a glorious responsibility, and because of the close combination with the business, it does not take much time to prepare lessons; and it is easy to correctly choose teaching materials, so that theory and practice are closely combined, so as to ensure the quality of teaching. On the other hand, for researchers, in their daily work, there are inevitably more practical tasks than theoretical summaries. The task of teaching is an opportunity for researchers to summarize and improve theoretically.
	(3) In the "three-in-one" system of the research institute, the research institute itself is the base for the college to implement the combination of education and labor production. The research institute also receives strong support from the students' production labor. Students can obtain the most advanced technology in the experimental factory of the research institute, and the students help workers put forward many suggestions for improving the process methods. In the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the role played by students in production labor is even more significant. For example, in the drawing work of a major research project of the research institute, the students drew more than 3,000 drawings and put forward 1,400 technical innovation suggestions.
	(4) For some basic courses, although the college must have its own experimental and internship equipment, for many professional courses, especially many expensive instruments and machines, it is not necessary to prepare a set by itself, but can be shared with the research institute. This is in line with the principle of running science diligently and frugally, and running schools diligently and frugally.
	(5) In the "three-in-one" combination, the research institute has one main and two auxiliary. The college run by the research institute also has its one main and two auxiliary, but that is teaching as the main focus, and research and production as auxiliary. However, this kind of research and production is closely combined with the work of the research institute itself. Even the Russian language teaching and research office can do a lot. With the help of the research institute, they will soon complete a Russian-Chinese optical mechanical specialized vocabulary with more than 20,000 entries. In addition, the research institute also entrusts some trial production and production tasks to the college.

The Optical Machinery College is growing in the continuous overcoming of difficulties, and the thinking of all teachers and students in the college has also been rapidly improved. Some individuals who were initially unwilling to study and work in this college that started from scratch have long been settled down. Because the growth of this college is due to the hard work of everyone, all teachers and students love the college immensely. The communist style formed in this growth process is also worthy of attention. When the college was divided into departments and majors last year, none of the more than 500 students in the college showed any emotional unease about the assigned major.

We have learned from running the college that as long as there is the leadership of the Party and politics is in command, any difficulty can be overcome; because the cause we are engaged in is the socialist cause under the brilliant light of the General Line, we can get the strong support of the Party and higher authorities and all parties; because we have implemented the Party's education to serve the proletariat and the principle of combining education with labor production, the quality of students' learning is good; because we follow the mass line, we can fully exert revolutionary enthusiasm and run the cause well.

Now, the Optical Precision Machinery College, run by the Optical Machinery Institute, is launching a climax of technical innovation and technical revolution movement in combination with teaching and production labor. This movement will further form an education revolution, making the college a major base for efficiently training scientific and technological research talent. In the future, the cadres who are both red and expert cultivated by the college will certainly be able to make significant contributions to accelerating the catch-up with the world's advanced science and technology level and climbing the peak of science.

    科学研究机构要培养专业人材
    王大珩委员的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告和陈叔通副主席的“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，并保证在工作中贯彻执行。
    我是一个科学技术工作者。我所在的单位是科学院设在长春的光学精密机械仪器研究所
  （以下简称光机所）。光机所自从1953年建立以来，在党的英明领导下，在科学研究上取得了巨大成就。特别是大跃进以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，研究工作更有着飞跃的发展。
    与此同时，光机所在解放思想，充分调动积极因素的另一方面，是利用研究所已建立起来的科学技术基础，在坚持以科学研究为主的原则下，创办高等学校并扩建实验工厂，形成以研究为主（一主）以办教育办工厂为辅（二辅）的“三结合”。到目前为止，这个“三结合”已见到很好的成效，可说是充分发挥科学技术力量，多快好省地服务于社会主义建设，向科学高峰跃进的一条道路。
    现在我谨就光机所办高等学校的经历多说一些。光机所所办的是一座全日制的理工高等学院——光学精密机械学院。这个学院到现在开办近两年了，已有了五百多名学生。它也是我国第一个以光学精密机械为专业的专门学院。开办以来，虽然经历了不少困难，但是由于政治挂帅，有坚定要把学院办起来，要办好而且要长久地办下去的决心和信心，现在这个学院不仅已办起来了，而且办得不错，以后也一定能越办越好。
    大跃进以来的经验告诉我们，要在科学技术上迅速赶上世界先进水平，攀登科学高峰，必须迅速建立起一支在本门专业中相当充沛而壮大的科学技术力量，使这门科学的研究工作能全面地展开，研究工作的各个方面能相互配合促进，从而加快研究速度，并且使获得的研究成果，既有量又有质。就光学精密机械方面的专门人材的培养来说，在解放后的几年里，在党的正确领导下，已有不少高等学校设立了有关光学和精密机械方面的专业，培养了相当数量的专业人材。他们在建立我国的光学事业中，起到了积极的作用。大跃进以来，我国的光学事业，也和其他建设战线上一样，正以前所未有的速度发展着，因此对于专业人材需要也就更加迫切。目前，在光学机械人材的培养上，还满足不了事业飞速发展的需要。这种情况，对于专业的研究机构来说，更是如此。每年能分配到的大学毕业生，离需要的数字相差很大。尤其是有些大学毕业生在来到研究所以后，由于过去的训练，不是专为从事研究工作而培养的，或者是专业的性质和要从事的研究工作不尽相同，往往来到研究所之后，还得经过一段时间的熟悉和学习过程。面对这种情况，光机所的党委根据中央和省委指示的精神，认识到像研究所这样的科学技术基地，应该把培养专业人材，壮大科学队伍做为一项基本职责。也只有把培养的任务担负起来，才能更好地解决今后大量需要科学研究干部的问题。
    研究所办高等学校，自然工作要紧张一些。但是为了办起我国第一个这种专业的理工学院，为了今后不久就能培养出大量的合用的科学技术研究干部，现在紧张一些又算得了什么呢？只要把高等学院办起来，不但更能促使研究所的发扬光大，就是学院本身，因为它对社会主义建设具有重要意义，也一定有远大的前途。
    由于党的正确领导，首先是得到了党和上级的大力支持，这个学院在坚持政治挂帅，“全所办学院”；坚持大搞群众运动，师生一起办学院；并且贯彻党的教育方针以及充分利用研究所“三结合”的特点的情况下，从无到有，从简陋走上完整地建立起来了。可以说，现在学院中同学们学习的成绩，已绝不低于有很好基础的高等学校。
    学院才开办时，为了开设基础课程，由所中调配了一部分研究人员做为专职教师。当学生已经来了，而实验室还在准备，房子也还欠缺，学生还要睡在地板上，吃饭在席棚中的时候，就有着一些保守的看法。有的怀疑研究所办高等学院，是否办得了。这是“办不了”论者。有的以为办学院是为了解决当前对干部的急需。把学院看如训练班，是临时性质的。学员毕业了，任务也就完了。这是“办不长”论者。也有这种想法，认为研究所以研究为主，就不能把精力灌注在教学上，因此怕“办不好”。可以说持这些右倾保守思想的人，只是就事论事，没有看到事物发展和事物之间相互联系的一面。在学院才开办时，光机所的科学技术力量的确是有限的，并且担负着紧张而繁重的研究任务。必须看到，光机所本身的力量，不是停留不前的。在大跃进，鼓足干劲地从事研究工作的进程中，科学技术水平在飞跃地提高，力量也在不断地快速增长。那么随着时间的前进，它将完全有可能来担负由于学院的日益成长和巩固所需具备的教学能力。党及时地反驳了那些右倾保守的论点，奠定了把学院办好的思想基础。事实无可辩驳地也已给这种右倾观点以有力的回击。
    本着自力更生为主的精神，党组织依靠群众，提出了要“全所办学院”。所中研究人员，自所长、高级研究人员以及很多青年科学技术人员都动员起来，担任学院的教学工作。自然，这是在不影响科学研究计划执行的情况下来进行的。他们并且还参加学院各种方针政策和教学计划的讨论。在实验室设备的建立上，学院也得到全所的支援。学生利用劳动生产锻炼的时间，也参加建立实验室和实习工场的工作。一部分学生还参加了教材的编选。这样就形成了“师生一齐办学院”的局面。
    在密切科学研究，教育和生产之间三结合中，感到研究所办高等学院，有以下特点：
      （1）由于学院的培养目标很明确，学院中的专业和课程的开设，完全可以结合研究所在今后几年发展中的具体需要，因时制宜地来制定教学计划。课程的内容更可经过缜密组织，提高教学效率，免去多余的部分和不必要的重复。例如在进行机械制图课时，就直接测绘光学仪器的结构，部件和组件，这样就可将机械制图课和光学仪器结构零件的课程合而为一。研究所许多具体工作内容，也可适当地充实到课程中去，使学生及时地掌握先进知识。很重要的一点是使学生们在学习时代就生活在将来工作的环境中。
      （2）研究所的研究人员，除了一部分为了开设基础理论课程，须要以教学为主而外，各种专业课程，都可由所中的专业科学技术人员担任。这样，工作者把培养新生力量看做是光荣的职责，而在备课上由于和业务的密切结合，需要花的时间不多；而且很易于正确地选择教材，使理论与实际密切结合起来，从而使教学质量有所保证。另一方面，对于研究人员来说，在日常工作中，不免实践性的任务多于理论性的总结的工作，教学的任务，正是研究人员在理论上总结提高的机会。
      （3）在研究所“三结合”的体系中，研究所本身就是学院贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合的基地。研究所也从学生的生产劳动中得到有力的支援。学生们在研究所的实验工厂中实习，可以获得最先进的工艺技术，而学生们又帮助工人提出不少改进工艺方法的建议。在当前技术革新技术革命运动中，学生们在生产劳动中所起的作用更为显著。例如在学生们参加研究所的某项重大研究项目的制图工作中，他们绘制了三千余张图纸，提出了技术革新的建议达一千四百条。
      （4）学院对于一些基础课程，虽然还必须有自己的实验和实习装备，但是对于许多专业课程所需用的设备，特别是许多价值昂贵的仪器和机器，可以不必自己准备一套，而可以和研究所合用。这是符合勤俭办科学，勤俭办学校的原则的。
      （5）在“三结合”中，研究所有一主二辅。研究所办的学院也有它的一主二辅，不过那是以教学为主，以研究和生产为辅了。但是这种研究、生产，又是和研究所本身的工作密切结合起来的。就是俄语教研室也很有可为。他们在研究所的帮助下，不久就将完成一部具有两万多条的俄汉光学机械专用词汇。另外，研究所也把一部分试制和生产任务交由学院来承担。
    光机学院在不断克服困难中成长，全院师生在思想上也得到迅速的提高。某些最初不愿意在这个白手起家的学院里学习和工作的个别人，也早就安下了心。由于这个学院的成长，有着每个人的辛勤劳动，全校师生，都对学院无比地热爱。在这成长过程中所形成的共产主义风格也是值得注意的。在去年学院分系分专业的时候，全院五百多名同学，没有一个对所分配的专业在情绪上表现不安。
    我们从办学院中体会到：只要有党的领导，政治挂帅，无论什么困难都可以克服；由于我们所从事的事业是总路线光辉照耀下的社会主义事业，就能得到党和上级以及各方面的大力支援；由于贯彻了党的教育为无产阶级服务，教育与劳动生产相结合的方针，学生的学习质量就好；由于走群众路线，就能充分发挥革命干劲，把事业办好。
    现在光机所办的光学精密机械学院，正在结合教学与生产劳动，展开技术革新技术革命运动的高潮。这个运动将进一步形成教育革命，使学院成为高效率培养科技研究人材的主要基地。今后由学院培养出的又红又专的干部，必将能为加速赶上世界先进科学技术水平，攀登科学高峰做出重大的贡献。
