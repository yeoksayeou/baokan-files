    On the Baolan Railway
    Li Ying
    Baolan Road

    Having just heard the ice dam on the ancient Yellow River ferry be blasted,
    Now I see peach blossoms floating on the Yellow River;
    In just one night, the Baolan Railway stretches two thousand *li*,
    Connecting so many families!
    In the desert, they are coking and smelting iron,
    On the Yellow River, they are building bridges and dams;
    A gust of spring rain enters the train window,
    In Longzhong, they are diverting the Tao River and afforesting.
    A train lets out a whistle,
    Heading north are machines, heading south are mules and horses;
    Even the time of sunrise and sunset seems longer,
    See how big the steps taken by the plateau are!
    I can't see enough of the leaping progress scenery along the way,
    I can't stop hearing songs rolling through the quicksand,
    The Baolan Road is a prominent sinew of the motherland,
    The rails are like they're connected to a million volts of electricity.
    I want to praise the Baolan Road,
    It itself is poetry, is painting;
    I want to pick a flower and offer it to the Baolan Road,
    It itself is also a *hada* offered to the motherland!
    Little Tree
    A little tree stands by the Yellow River,
    With the golden sun shining on it,
    With the ancient river water nurturing it,
    It then spews a new green into the vast desert.
    It spits out new green flourishing,
    Not because the sun shines, the river nourishes,
    But because a road-building soldier,
    Planted it before leaving.
    The Party cultivated a strong soldier,
    The soldier endowed his character to the little tree,
    He wants it to represent himself here,
    To hold back the great sandstorms and misty rain;
    Also, he wants it to grow leaves, bear fruit,
    Also, he wants it to attract small birds to nest and live;
    It watches the Yellow River day and night,
    It protects the Baolan Road day and night.
    Tonight, where will the soldier go,
    Hexi? Longdong? Minyue? Bashu?
    Please ask our shining rails and the trees along the road,
    They are his bold steps.
    Longdong in March
    The spring breeze sends me northwest,
    My eyes are full of green willows and red peaches,
    This place is good, that place is good,
    But none are as beautiful as Longdong in March.
    Wheat seedlings in patches, orchards in layers,
    From the fertile fields straight up to the hills;
    Water flows in the canals, wheels on the roads, full of songs,
    From where does a burst of rooster crowing come.
    Especially that yellow-brown mountain top,
    The commune members camp out with red flags,
    The large-character slogan "Divert the Tao" is inlaid on the hillside,
    A great revolution is being launched on the Loess Plateau!

    包兰路上
    李瑛
    包兰路
    刚听罢黄河古渡炸冰坝，
    又看到黄河水上泛桃花；
    只一夜包兰铁路两千里，
    牵起了多少人家！
    沙漠里在炼焦、炼铁，
    黄河上在修桥、筑坝；
    一阵春雨进车窗，
    陇中又在引洮、绿化。
    一列车一阵呼啸，
    北上的是机器，南下的是骡马；
    日出日落的时间也显得长了，
    看高原迈出的步伐有多大！
    望不尽一路跃进景色，
    听不绝歌声辗流沙，
    包兰路是祖国一条突起的筋络，
    铁轨也像通上了百万伏特的电压。
    我要赞美包兰路，
    它本身就是诗、是画；
    我要采朵花献给包兰路，
    它本身也是献给祖国的一条哈达！
    小树
    黄河岸边立着一棵小树，
    有金色的太阳照耀，
    有古老的河水抚育，
    它便向茫茫沙海吐出一片新绿。
    它吐出新绿欣欣向荣，
    不是因为太阳照耀、河水抚育，
    而是因为一个筑路战士，
    在撤离之前把它栽就。
    党培育了一个坚强的战士，
    战士把自己的性格赋予小树，
    他要它在这里代表自己，
    挽住大风沙和雨雪晨雾；
    还要它长叶子、结果子，
    还要它引小鸟作窠来住；
    它日夜看守黄河水，
    它日夜保卫包兰路。
    今夜战士去哪边，
    河西？陇东？闽粤？巴蜀？
    请问我们闪光的铁轨和路旁一棵棵树，
    它们便是他迈出的豪迈的脚步。
    三月陇东
    春风送我西北行，
    满眼是柳绿桃红，
    这里也好、那里也好，
    却美不过三月的陇东。
    麦苗片片，果林层层，
    从沃野直上丘陵；
    渠里流水，路上车轮，满是歌声，
    从哪里又传来一片鸡鸣。
    最是那黄褐色的高山顶，
    社员们扎营安寨大旗红，
    “引洮”的大字标语镶在山坡上，
    黄土高原正掀起一场大革命！
