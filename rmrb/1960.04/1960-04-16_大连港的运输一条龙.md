Dalian Port's One-Stop Transportation Service

One-stop passenger service means that trains, ships, stations, and hotels are connected in a single line. Once passengers board the "Dragon Train" or "Dragon Ship," their food, accommodation, and travel are all arranged. It is convenient and shortens travel time. An elderly passenger praised: "Stepping into the train is like coming home, helped up and down and even served tea, and there's a car to pick you up after getting off. Everyone praises the Dragon Train and Dragon Ship."

Speech by Representative Wang Yuji to the Presidium of the Congress and all Representatives:

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, we see before us a magnificent and splendid picture of continued great leaps forward. I am very happy and wholeheartedly support and guarantee to resolutely implement it.

Now I will report to the congress on the production situation at Dalian Seaport.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the shining light of the General Line, and inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of our Dalian Port workers has been unprecedentedly high. They are full of energy. In their production work, they have displayed high labor enthusiasm and creative wisdom, and have used their labor to rapidly change the face of production. In 1959, we achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The port's throughput increased by 27.8% compared to 1958, setting the highest record in the sixty years since the port was built. All other production indicators were also completed or overfulfilled. At the beginning of this year, our port's production showed a situation of rapid daily progress, and technical innovation and technical revolution also experienced an unprecedented boom. All production indicators continued to leap forward on the basis of 1959. The throughput in the first quarter increased by 35% compared to the same period last year. The entire port is showing a thriving scene everywhere.

The reason we were able to achieve these results is that all of our port workers resolutely listen to Chairman Mao, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought, liberated our minds, mustered our energy, displayed the communist spirit of "leaving difficulties to ourselves and convenience to others," vigorously carried out one-stop transportation collaboration, vigorously carried out technical revolution, and made a big technical performance competition. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the Party's leadership.

Passenger and freight one-stop service increases volume and provides convenience for passengers.

Since the one-stop freight transportation collaboration was launched last winter, it has brought a new atmosphere to the road and port areas of Dalian. Road and port workers broke old rules and regulations, abolished boundary markers, and opened the gates of handover lines. Road and port, united as one, carried out production organization and production management revolution, and implemented the "Ten Unifications" plan: unified dispatching, freight transportation, planning indicators, unified labor force and equipment use, unified technical operation processes, measures, and shifts, unified competition, analysis, summary, and reporting. In addition, we also sent people to relevant railway bureaus, factories, mines, material departments, and brother ports in Northeast China to build a one-stop transportation collaboration network. Last winter and this spring, we took "dragon dancing" and "dragon protection" as the center, continuously launched production upsurges, and pushed one-stop transportation collaboration to a new climax. In the first quarter, we dispatched 1,274 dragons, and the goods transported by completed dragons reached about 60%. One-stop transportation collaboration has already shown its powerful power in the Dalian area. Now the flow of vehicles and ships arriving at the port is basically connected, the transportation of goods is timely, and coal and other land-to-water transported goods are basically transported as soon as they arrive, without stopping. Land-to-water transported grain is also formed into dragon trains and ships, and the goods are unimpeded. The proportion of vehicle-ship transshipment has increased by 30% compared to 1959, which greatly accelerated the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, and increased the port's throughput capacity, making the port's loading and unloading work an unprecedentedly good situation. In 1958, the city mobilized 250,000 person-times to load and unload goods at our port, helping us overcome the transportation tension. In 1959, it also supported our port with 150,000 person-times. If we compare this situation to fighting a war, we only had the ability to parry, but no ability to fight back. However, since the first quarter of this year, the situation has been completely different. The port's throughput has increased by 35% compared to the same period last year. Not only did we not ask for help from brother units, but the number of stevedores was also reduced by 10%. The workers happily said: "Last year, there were too few goods to eat, but this year, there are too many goods to be full."

Starting in December last year, we also organized a one-stop passenger service. The one-stop passenger service is a comprehensive communist collaboration of cars, ships, stations and shops with Dalian Port Passenger Station and Dalian Railway Station as the center. This is a new type of passenger transportation service organization form in which the whole journey by water and land, car, ship, station, and shop are connected in a single line and interlocked. It broke the boundaries between industries and ended the past situation where these units lived their own lives. At present, seventeen transportation and service departments in the Dalian area have participated in this large collaboration team. As soon as passengers board the "Dragon Car" and "Dragon Ship", the service personnel on the car and ship will arrange the three major events of eating, lodging and traveling for the entire journey. Passengers receive meticulous reception and care everywhere like relatives. Therefore, the mental burden on passengers is reduced and the travel time is shortened. Passengers happily said: "In the new society, everything is good at home, and it is more convenient to go out." They also said: "Our Party and the country are thinking of the people everywhere." An elderly passenger praised:

	Stepping into the train is like coming home,
	Old and weak with failing eyesight,
	Cared for all the way,
	Helped up and down and served tea,
	There is also a car to pick you up after getting off,
	Everyone praises the Dragon Train and Dragon Ship.

Because we have done a good job in one-stop collaboration, our lives are also getting better. Before collaboration, life was tight, but after collaboration, life is red. The achievements of one-stop collaboration have further encouraged workers' confidence in carrying out one-stop service. When workers hear that the Dragon Car has arrived, they are eager to go to work to ensure that the Dragon will not be "trapped." In their work practice, our road and port workers have deeply realized that one-stop transportation collaboration does have great political and economic significance. At the same time, we also know that the formation of each Dragon is the result of the hard work of various brother departments under complex conditions and overcoming various difficulties, and it is a precious gift in the great collaboration. Therefore, when each Dragon arrives, we welcome and value it very much, and muster up soaring energy to organize rapid loading and unloading. When the workers in the Gan Jingzi operation area receive the Dragon Car forecast, they raise a big red flag on the command tower. As soon as the workers see the red flag, they know that the Dragon Car has arrived and immediately throw themselves into battle. The workers who are off work do not want to go home when they hear that the Dragon Car and Dragon Ship are coming. They rush to work with each other, compete with each other, and do not let go of every second. After the work is over, everyone is in a good mood.

Launch a vigorous technical innovation, the goal: mechanization of loading and unloading

In order to adapt to the rapid development needs of one-stop freight transportation collaboration, Dalian Port workers, while carrying out port organization reform, enthusiastically responded to the Party's great call, launched a vigorous mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and conscientiously implemented the two-legged walking policy of being modern if possible, being indigenous if modern is not possible, from indigenous to modern, and combining modern and indigenous methods. In the practice of the past few years, all port workers have deeply realized that technical innovation and technical revolution are the only correct ways to rapidly improve the port's throughput capacity and tap the potential of port equipment. Therefore, as soon as the Party's call was issued, the broad masses immediately actively and consciously threw themselves into the movement, determined to realize the slogan of "one mechanization and four changes" in 1960 (one mechanization: that is, mechanization of loading and unloading of bulk cargo by both indigenous and modern methods, four changes: that is, changing heavy labor to light labor; changing low efficiency to high efficiency; changing manual operation to mechanical operation; changing the work of the majority to the work of the minority), and rapidly changing the port's loading and unloading appearance.

In order to achieve this goal, all port workers have fought three major battles in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement since this year. After several months of heroic struggle, they have achieved great results. So far, 1,467 technical innovation and technical revolution projects have been completed, with 4,243 pieces, including ground slides, log pulley cranes, small cranes, wood strip conveyors, double-lock reciprocating shovels, and eight-petal grabs. A total of 26 modern and indigenous mechanized loading and unloading assembly lines and 204 loading and unloading linkage lines were formed. The proportion of mechanization in the entire port has rapidly increased from 50% at the end of last year to 72%. The efficiency of work shifts has increased from 20.9 tons last year to 27 tons in March this year. The entire port is basically full of modern and indigenous machinery in lines and groups. Now we can relatively save 580 labor forces. The entire port also eliminated shoulder carrying and manual lifting on February 23 this year, one month and six days ahead of schedule (originally planned before the end of March), ending the heavy and primitive labor methods left over from generations. Things that we did not dare to think about in the past have been successfully realized today under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. This is a great event that is exciting and encouraging. The workers have composed many poems and songs, praising the Party and technical revolution. The old workers sang:

		The Party sends a spring breeze and red flowers bloom,
		Thousand-year-old carrying poles are tied up;
		Don't look at the old man being fifty-three,
		He can still work for several decades.

		Once upon a time, loading and unloading was all carrying and moving,
		Backs were bent over fifty years old;
		Now that mechanization has been realized,
		Although old, he can still work for ten years.

The workers generally sang:

		Technical transformation blooms with red flowers,
		Carrying poles and big baskets return to their hometowns;
		Labor is light and efficient,
		The Party's kindness is greater than the sky.

		With mechanization in loading and unloading,
		What is moving mountains and overturning seas?
		Come on, Mount Tai!
		Where to go and what to do is up to us.

Great collaboration, great competition, great improvement

In the vigorous technical revolution movement, all port employees put politics in command, broke the boundaries of working hours, worked selflessly regardless of morning or evening and without regard to remuneration, relied on their own efforts, designed by themselves, manufactured by themselves, and liberated themselves. In order to carry out large-scale creation, workers generally established amateur processing plants, and amateur processing plants bloomed all over the port. When difficulties were encountered, they collaborated. If one unit lacked materials, everyone thought of ways to help. If one unit lacked manpower, everyone supported it. When technical difficulties were encountered, they held Zhuge Liang meetings. In short, everyone asked for help and responded to each other, all striving for a common goal. During the movement, thousands of employees fought day and night, refusing to leave the front line. Innovation has become "obsessive." For example, Comrade Yu Xinshan, in order to overcome a cutting-edge project, thought about it every day, thought about it while walking, thought about it while eating, and thought about it while lying in bed. He recorded it anytime and anywhere, overcame various difficulties, and finally successfully trial-produced it. Carpenters Zhu Zhenjia and Wang Qianzhou successively created and successfully produced five indigenous machine tools, such as multi-knife and multi-blade woodworking lathes and indigenous planers, and their efficiency increased by four to fifteen times respectively. Everyone carried out technical innovation and technical revolution with this kind of effort. Since the beginning of the year, our port has emerged with 18 advanced innovation collectives and 513 innovation pacesetters.

In order to promote the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, promote the use of new machinery, and improve loading and unloading efficiency, we also held large-scale technical performance competitions. In the performance, work area employees, various loading and unloading teams, and workers between loading and unloading groups sang rival shows, constantly creating miracles of high efficiency. On February 27 this year, when we performed unloading salt on a 3,000-ton salt ship, the comrades who participated in the battle said: "It took us two hours and forty-five minutes to unload this ship, although we created a new record and improved the ship unloading efficiency by five times compared to the past, but we are not satisfied. We will take it down within two hours in no time!" As expected, on March 17, when we performed on another ship, it took only one hour and forty-eight minutes to unload a total of 3,045 tons of salt. Everyone really wanted to work more and more, and the more they worked, the more energetic they became, so high-efficiency records were repeatedly broken. Dalian Port has now created new loading and unloading records of "unloading 10,000 tons of ore ships in less than a day, unloading 3,000 tons of sea salt ships in two hours, unloading 5,000 tons of general cargo ships in just one day, loading 4,000 tons of iron and wood ships in one day and night, and unloading steel vehicles in less than an hour."

Technical innovation and technical revolution in Dalian Port have effectively promoted the improvement of production efficiency. After the tipper's pressure beam in the Gan Jingzi operation area was modified again and again, it solved the key to not being able to tip and unload sand and gravel trucks, and also solved the problem of the Dragon Car not disintegrating, so that the entire Dragon can be tipped onto the ship, which greatly improved loading and unloading efficiency.

At present, all port employees, on the basis of victory, are determined to achieve a mechanization rate of 80% before "May Day" to present gifts to "May Day", and to realize the mechanization rate in the eight-year technical transformation ahead of schedule this year, and to achieve a mechanization rate of 95% by the end of the year.

In the vigorous production, we also paid attention to the lives of employees. We conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees on "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other", implemented the principle of "self-reliance as the main principle and striving for foreign aid as a supplement" for the supply of non-staple foods, and implemented the principle of diligence and thrift in running non-staple industries in a simple and easy way, combining professional production and amateur production, and vigorously launched a mass movement for non-staple food production, and opened up non-staple food production bases, planting more than 1,000 mu of land. Last year, the main non-staple foods supplied to employees were 13,000 jin of meat, 28,000 eggs, 161,000 jin of milk, 230,000 jin of fresh fish, 120,000 jin of shellfish, and 190,000 jin of vegetables, rice noodles, and tofu. This year, we plan to have another major development on this basis, planning to raise 10,000 pigs, 10,000 chickens, 10,000 ducks, catch 500,000 jin of fish, produce 210,000 jin of milk, and 150,000 jin of apples. After realizing this figure, the lives of employees will be greatly improved. With the improvement of material life, employees' cultural life has also made significant progress. The seaport club is open to employees every day from morning to night; amateur art propaganda teams often perform programs in workers' rest rooms and canteens; grass-roots art groups perform small performances in their units every day and big performances every three days. Art activities relieve workers' fatigue and educate them.

In addition, all other work has also achieved great results. In the production and various movements, the political awareness of employees has rapidly improved, their thinking has been continuously liberated, and they have shown unprecedented ambition and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Communist ideology is growing vigorously in the consciousness of employees, and they go wherever the Party points, and many advanced figures and moving deeds have emerged. Under the guidance of the ideology of continuous revolution, all employees are using their practical actions to continuously refresh labor and production records day by day.

While completing their own work, all of our port employees also actively supported the four modernizations of the countryside. We sent technical forces to help peasant brothers with design and planning, and transferred a certain amount of machinery and materials to help peasant brothers build reservoirs and carry out agricultural technical transformation, helping the countryside to realize the four modernizations as soon as possible.

Although we have achieved great results, we are still far from the Party's requirements for us. Therefore, in our future work, we must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and on the basis of the victories we have achieved, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take majestic steps, vigorously carry out one-stop transportation collaboration at high speed, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to achieve high-speed production and strive forward to ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960.

    大连港的运输一条龙
    客运服务一条龙，就是车、船、站、店一线相连。旅客一登上“龙车”“龙船”，吃、住、行全安排好了；既方便，又可缩短旅行时间。一位老年旅客赞扬说：跨进列车如到家，搀上扶下还送茶，下车还有车接送，龙车龙船人人夸。
    王玉吉代表的发言大会主席团、各位代表：
    听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，在我们面前展现了一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的图画，我心里非常高兴，衷心地拥护并保证坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我把大连海港的生产情况向大会作一汇报。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，我们大连港职工政治热情空前高涨，干劲越鼓越足，在生产工作中，发挥了高度的劳动热忱和创造智慧，用自己的劳动迅速改变生产面貌。1959年我们实现了全面大跃进。港口吞吐量比1958年增长了27.8％，创出了大连港建港六十年来的最高纪录。其他各项生产指标也都完成或超额完成了。今年一开门，我港生产就出现了日新月异步步上升的局面，技术革新和技术革命也出现了前所未有的盛况，各项生产指标又在1959年的基础上持续大跃进。第一季度吞吐量比去年同期提高了35％。全港到处呈现出一片欣欣向荣景象。
    我们所以能取得这些成绩，是我们全港职工坚决听毛主席的话，在毛主席的思想指导下，解放了思想，鼓足了干劲，发挥了“困难留给自己，方便让给别人”的共产主义风格，大搞一条龙运输协作，大搞技术革命和大闹技术表演赛的结果。这是毛主席思想的伟大胜利，是党的领导的伟大胜利。
    客运、货运一条龙，运量增加，旅客称便
    货运一条龙大协作，自去冬开展以来，为大连地区的路港带来了一片新的气象，路、港职工打破了旧的规章制度，废除了界石，打开了交接线大门。路、港一家步调一致的进行了生产组织和生产管理革命，实行了“十统一”方案：统一了调度、货运、计划指标，统一了劳动力、设备的使用，统一了技术作业过程、措施、班次，统一了竞赛、分析总结汇报。此外我们还派人去东北各有关铁路局、厂矿、物资部门以及兄弟港口，建成了一条龙运输协作网。去冬今春我们以“舞龙”、“保龙”为中心，连续掀起了生产高潮，把一条龙运输协作推向了新的高潮。第一季度我们发出了一千二百七十四条龙，成龙运输的货物已达60％左右。一条龙运输大协作在大连地区已经显示出它的强大威力。现在到港车流和船流基本衔接了，货物运输及时了，煤炭和其他陆转水运货物基本上随到随运，货不停留；陆转水运的粮食也是车船成龙，货物畅通；车船换装比重，比1959年提高了30％，大大的加速了车、船、货的周转，提高了港口通过能力，使我港的装卸工作，出现了空前未有的大好形势。1958年全市出动了二十五万人次到我港装卸，帮助我们渡过运输紧张关，1959年也支援了我港十五万人次。若把这种情况比成打仗，我们就是只有招架之功，没有还手之力。可是从今年第一季度开始情况就完全不同了，港口吞吐量比去年同期增长了35％，我们不但没向兄弟单位求援，装卸工人还减少了10％，工人们乐的说：去年货少吃不了，今年货多吃不饱。
    从去年12月份开始，又组织起客运服务一条龙。客运服务一条龙就是以大连港客运站、大连火车站为中心的车、船、站、店的全面共产主义大协作。这是水陆全程车、船、站、店一线相连，环环相扣的新型的客运服务组织形式。它打破了行业界限，结束了过去这些单位各自过日子的局面。目前大连地区已有十七个运输、服务部门参加到这一大协作队伍里来。旅客一登上“龙车”、“龙船”，就由车船上的服务人员为他们安排好整个旅途中的吃、住、行三件大事。旅客到处受到亲人般的无微不至的接待与照顾。因此，减轻了旅客精神上的负担，缩短了旅行的时间。旅客高兴的说：新社会在家事事好，出门更方便。又说：我们党和国家处处都为人民着想。有一位老年旅客赞扬说：
    跨进列车如到家，
    年迈无力眼睛花，
    一路之上蒙照顾，
    搀上扶下还送茶，
    下车还有车接送，
    龙车龙船人人夸。
    因为我们把一条龙协作搞好了，所以日子也过好了。没协作以前日子紧，协作以后日子红。一条龙大协作所取得的成就更鼓舞了职工大搞一条龙的信心。工人听说龙车到了，就磨拳擦掌，保证不“困”龙。我们路港职工在工作实践中深深体会到一条龙运输大协作确实具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。同时我们也知道每一条龙的组成，都是经过各兄弟部门在错综复杂的条件下，克服种种困难，辛勤劳动而来的，是大协作中的珍贵礼品。因此当每条龙到达的时候，我们都非常欢迎、重视，并鼓起冲天干劲，组织快速装卸。甘井子作业区职工每接到龙车预报，就在司令塔上升起大红旗，工人一看见红旗，就知道龙车到了，马上投入战斗。下班的职工，听说来了龙车、龙船就不想回家，互相抢着干，互相比赛，分秒不让，工作结束后，就个个心情愉快。
    大闹技术革新，目标：装车卸车机械化
    为了适应货运一条龙运输大协作飞跃发展的需要，大连港职工在进行港口组织改革的同时，热烈的响应了党的伟大号召，开展了轰轰烈烈的、群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，认真贯彻执行了能洋则洋，不能洋则土，由土到洋，洋土结合的两条腿走路的方针。全港职工在几年来的实践中，深深的体会到技术革新和技术革命是迅速提高港口通过能力的、挖掘港口设备潜力的唯一的正确途径，因而党的号召一出，广大群众立即积极地自觉地投入到运动中来，决心在1960年实现“一化四变”（一化：即大宗货物装卸土洋机械化，四变：即变重劳动为轻劳动；变低效率为高效率；变手工操作为机具操作；变多数人干为少数人干）的口号，迅速改变港口装卸面貌。
    为了达到这个目的，全港职工，在今年以来，技术革新、技术革命运动中连续打了三个大的战役，经过几个月来的英勇奋战，已经取得了很大成绩，到目前为止已经完成技术革新、技术革命项目一千四百六十七项，四千二百四十三件，其中主要的有地面滑道、元木辘辘吊、小型吊、木条输送机、双锁往复铲、八瓣抓斗等机具。共组成了二十六条土洋机械装卸流水线，二百零四条装卸联动线。全港机械化比重已经由去年年底的50％迅速提高到72％，工班效率由去年的二十点九吨，达到今年3月份的二十七吨。全港基本上是土洋机械成线成群。现在我们可以相对的节约五百八十名劳动力。全港并于今年2月23日提前一个月零六天（原计划3月底以前）消灭了肩扛人抬，结束了世世代代遗留下来的笨重的原始的劳动方式。过去不敢想的事情，今天在党和毛主席的英明领导下胜利的实现了。这是一件令人欢欣鼓舞的大喜事。工人们编了好多诗歌、歌颂党、歌颂技术革命，老工人歌颂说：
            党送春风红花开，
            千年扁担捆起来；
            别看老汉五十三，
            还能干上几十载。
                                    ＊　＊
            昔日装卸扛和搬，
            年过五十脊背弯；
            如今实现机械化，
            虽老尚能干十年。
    工人普遍歌颂说：
            技术改造开红花，
            扁担大筐回老家；
            劳动轻快效率高，
            党的恩情比天大。
                                      ＊　＊
            装卸有了机械化，
    移山倒海算个啥？
    五岳泰山来吧！
    何去何从由咱。
    大协作，大竞赛，大提高
    在大搞技术革命运动中，全港员工政治挂帅，打破了工作时间界限，不分早晚，不计报酬，忘我劳动，自力更生，自己设计，自己制造，自己解放自己。工人们为了大搞创造，普遍的成立了业余加工厂，业余加工厂在全港遍地开花。遇到了困难就搞协作，这个单位缺材料，大家就想办法帮助，那个单位缺人力大家就支援，遇到技术关，就开诸葛亮会。总之大家是你求我帮，我求你应，都为共同的目标而奋斗。在运动中成千的职工日夜奋战，不肯下火线，革新已经成“迷”，比如宇忻山同志为了攻克一个尖端的项目，天天想，走路想，吃饭想，倒在床上也想，随时想随时记，克服了种种困难，终于试制成功。木工朱振家、王谦周两名同志接连不断的创造成功了多刀多刃木工土车床，土净刨床等五项土机具，效率分别提高四到十五倍。大家就是以这种干劲来进行技术革新和技术革命的。年初以来我港已涌现出先进革新集体十八个，革新标兵五百一十三名。
    为了促进技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，推广使用新机具，提高装卸效率，我们又大搞了技术表演赛。在表演当中，作业区职工中间，各装卸队、装卸组工人之间，大唱对台戏，不断创出高效率的奇迹。今年2月27日，我们在一条装盐三千吨轮船上表演卸盐时，参加战斗的同志说：“这次卸这条船，用了两小时四十五分钟，虽然创造了新纪录，比过去提高卸船效率五倍，但我们并不满足，用不上几次，我们非把它在两小时以内拿下来不可！“未出所料，在3月17日我们在另一条轮船上表演时，共卸三千零四十五吨盐就只用了一小时四十八分钟。大家真是越干越想干、越干越有劲，因此高效率的纪录也一再刷新。大连港现在已创出了“万吨矿石卸船不过天，三千吨海盐卸船两点完，五千吨杂货卸船只一天，四千吨铁木装船一昼夜，和钢铁卸车不过点”的装卸车船新纪录。
    大连港的技术革新、技术革命已经有力的促进了生产效率的提高，甘井子作业区的翻车机压梁一改再改以后，解决了不能翻卸砂石车的关键，还解决了龙车不解体，使整龙翻车上船，大大的提高了装卸效率。
    目前全港职工，正在胜利的基础上，决心在“五一”前把机械化比重达到80％，向“五一”献礼，并要把八年技术改造中的机械化比重提前在今年内实现，到年底机械化比重达到95％。
    在大搞生产当中我们也注意了职工的生活。认真贯彻执行了党中央、省、市委“一手抓生产、一手抓生活”的指示；执行了副食品供应以“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针；贯彻了因陋就简勤俭办副业的原则，专业生产和业余生产相结合，大搞了副食品生产的群众运动，开辟了副食品生产基地，种地一千余亩。去年供应职工食用的主要副食品有肉一万三千斤，蛋二万八千个，牛奶十六万一千斤，鲜鱼二十三万斤，贝类十二万斤，蔬菜、粉皮、豆腐等十九万斤。今年计划在这个基础上再来个大发展，计划养猪一万头、鸡一万只、鸭一万只、捕鱼五十万斤，牛奶二十一万斤，苹果十五万斤。实现这个数字后，职工生活将大大改善。随着物质生活的提高，职工的文化生活也有了显著的进展。海港俱乐部，每天从早晨到夜晚为职工开放；业余文艺宣传队经常在工人休息室、食堂演出节目；基层文艺小组在本单位一天一小演，三天一大演。文艺活动使工人既解除了疲劳，又受到了教育。
    此外，其他各项工作也都取得了很大的成绩。在生产和各项运动当中，职工的政治觉悟迅速提高，思想不断解放，表现了空前的雄心壮志和敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。共产主义思想在员工的意识中蓬勃增长，党指向那里就奔向那里，涌现了很多先进人物和动人事迹。全体员工在不断革命思想的指导下，以自己的实际行动，日新月异的刷新着劳动和生产纪录。
    我们全港职工在完成自己工作的同时，还积极支援了农村四化，我们派出了技术力量帮助农民兄弟搞设计，搞规划，并抽调了一定数量的机械和物资帮助农民兄弟修水库和农业技术改造，帮助农村尽快的实现四化。
    尽管我们取得了很大的成绩，但距党对我们的要求，还相差很远。因此，我们要在今后的工作中，认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，听党的话，听毛主席的话，在已取得的胜利的基础上，高举毛泽东思想红旗，迈着雄壮的步伐，高速度的大搞一条龙运输协作，大搞技术革新、技术革命运动，实现生产高速度，为保证实现1960年的继续大跃进，奋勇前进。
