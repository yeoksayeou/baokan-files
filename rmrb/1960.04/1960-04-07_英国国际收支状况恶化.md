    Britain's International Balance of Payments Worsens
    According to the "1960 Economic Survey" published by the British government on March 31, Britain's international balance of payments situation became increasingly unstable in 1959. Last year, British imports increased from £3.33 billion to £3.65 billion, while exports only increased from £3.428 billion to £3.538 billion. At the same time, invisible income (overseas investment, shipping revenue, etc.) decreased from £467 million in 1958 to £431 million in 1959. Overseas expenditures (mainly military expenses) increased from £216 million in 1958 to the current £228 million. These are all factors contributing to the deterioration of the international balance of payments.
    In 1959, gold and convertible currency reserves decreased by £119 million. The reserve amount at the end of 1959 was £977 million.

    英国国际收支状况恶化
    根据英国政府3月31日发表的“1960年经济综览”，1959年英国的国际收支情况愈来愈不稳定。去年英国的进口从三十三亿三千万英镑增加到了三十六亿五千万英镑，而出口却只从三十四亿二千八百万英镑增加到了三十五亿三千八百万英镑。同时，无形收入（海外投资、航运业收入，等等）从1958年的四亿六千七百万英镑下降到了1959年的四亿三千一百万英镑。海外支出（主要是军费）则从1958年的二亿一千六百万英镑上升到了现在的二亿二千八百万英镑。这些都是国际支付状况恶化的因素。
    1959年，黄金和可兑换货币储备减少了一亿一千九百万英镑。1959年底的储备数量是九亿七千七百万英镑。
