Add Water and Fertilizer, Increase Ears and Grains, Prevent Diseases and Eliminate Pests, Strive for a Bumper Harvest
Refine Wheat Management in Hebei and Sichuan
Nine Provinces (Regions) Including Henan Have Already Treated 35 Million Mu for Rust Prevention
Penglai County Conducts Three Checks and Three Supplements on Every Wheat Field; Yanshi County Continues Efforts to Eliminate Category Three Seedlings

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Recently, due to rising temperatures and increased humidity, diseases and pests that harm wheat, such as rust, scab, armyworms, and wheat spider mites, have been developing rapidly. A wheat protection campaign centered on rust eradication is vigorously unfolding in various places. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces (regions), including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Xinjiang, the area treated for rust prevention and control has reached 35 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The broad masses of Hebei Province, in order to seize the first summer wheat bumper harvest of the 1960s, have launched a wheat super-production competition throughout the province, adopting the method of simultaneously applying water and fertilizer to vigorously tackle the wheat jointing stage.

In order to achieve overall balanced and high wheat yields, Party committees at all levels, while focusing on high-yield plots, have made it their current urgent task to focus on ordinary fields, Category Three wheat, and low-yield wheat, strengthening leadership over weak links. Shijiazhuang City, in order to ensure the proper management of all wheat fields, on the one hand, designated 16,000 secretaries at all levels to focus on 3.72 million mu of high-yield plots; on the other hand, it organized 1,200 professional teams, led by secretaries at all levels, to adopt fixed-point contracting and strengthen management of Category Three wheat. In Anguo County, after applying additional fertilizer, water, and management to 60,000 mu of Category Three seedlings, 70% have been upgraded.

During the intensive wheat management efforts, various localities have also adopted the method of combining leaders, technical personnel, and experienced farmers to vigorously carry out the "Four Skilfuls" (skilfully applying topdressing fertilizer at the jointing stage, skilfully irrigating at the jointing stage, skilfully cultivating, skilfully removing rotten leaves) and "Four Preventatives" (preventing lodging, preventing frost, preventing diseases, preventing pests) campaign, striving for excellence in wheat management. In order to prevent rust from spreading and becoming a disaster, the province has established more than 28,000 rust disease reporting points, and more than 80,000 technical personnel are fighting in the fields to carry out disease prevention and pest control campaigns. Now, not only have two million mu of wheat fields been upgraded, but also the pace of farmland water conservancy construction throughout the province has been greatly promoted. To date, the irrigated area of wheat fields has expanded from 23.6 million mu in February to more than 26 million mu, of which 19 million mu of wheat fields have achieved dual insurance of surface and underground water.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Sichuan Province's more than 25 million mu of wheat are generally growing well. Party committees at all levels have mobilized the masses to further strengthen late-stage wheat field management, promoting full, plump, and heavy wheat grains to achieve even greater harvests.

Various localities have paid special attention to preventing lodging during late-stage wheat field management. Since late March, the Sichuan Basin has been continuously attacked by low temperatures, and the vast numbers of cadres and masses have risen up to fight against wind and rain. In Lezhi County, soil was cultivated once for plots that had not yet experienced lodging, and two or three times for high-yield areas; in individual areas where lodging had occurred, the wheat seedlings were immediately gently lifted, and soil was cultivated in layers between the rows of wheat, following the direction against the wind, so that the wheat seedlings returned to their original state.

Various localities have also actively prevented and controlled diseases and pests. This year, wheat rust in Sichuan Province is quite serious, with a general incidence rate as high as 15%. Four special districts, including Neijiang, Dazhou, Wanxian, and Mianyang, have adopted joint prevention and control methods, with each commune mobilizing more than 1.9 million people for thorough prevention and control. In Jiangjin Special District, more than one million mu of wheat with serious diseases and pests have been treated two or three times, and the pests and diseases have been basically eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Penglai County, Shandong Province, conducts field management according to wheat growth patterns, observing the weather and the land, skillfully seizing the wheat jointing stage.

Each commune has launched a "Three Checks, Three Supplements, Three Eliminates" campaign for wheat fields. The Three Checks are to check moisture, fertilizer content, and disease and pest conditions. The Three Supplements are to supplement water, fertilizer, and pesticides as needed, based on the results of the checks. The Three Eliminates are to eliminate weak seedlings, eliminate dry fields, and eliminate overlooked diseases and pests. The experience in irrigation is: for high-yield seedlings, those with a soil moisture content of 15% or more, lush stems and leaves, and a tendency to lodge, irrigation is postponed until the base of the first or second internode has formed; those with a soil moisture content of less than 15% are still rapidly irrigated with small amounts of water; those with a moisture content exceeding 25% are drained by digging ditches along the edges of the fields, applying ash fertilizer, and spreading dry sand. Generally, wheat fields with a soil moisture content of less than 17% are immediately supplemented with water. Category Three seedlings are not prone to lodging, so fertilizer is applied with water to promote rapid upgrading.

Each commune has also made a series of preparations for wheat heading, flowering, grain filling, and setting, so that wheat field management is linked one after another, one stage after another. According to the analysis of the Penglai County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the heading, flowering, and grain-filling periods of wheat are the periods that require the most moisture, are the most serious periods for diseases and pests, and are also the key periods for striving for large ears, many grains, and plump grains. The main measures for management during this stage are to prioritize water, supplement with phosphate fertilizer, and strengthen the "Four Preventatives" (preventing rust, preventing wheat borers, preventing wind, preventing lodging). During the flowering and grain-filling period, there are many southwest winds, and high-yield wheat is prone to lodging when watered and exposed to wind, and not watering can easily lead to drought and dry tips, affecting grain filling. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly water before flowering and grain filling (also before the strong southwest winds). Each commune is actively storing water, fertilizer, and pesticides as needed.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Yanshi County, Henan Province, seizes the late stage of wheat growth and once again launches a comprehensive campaign to strengthen wheat field management, centered on vigorously managing Category Three seedlings and eliminating "yellow patches."

More than 50,000 wheat field management troops throughout the county are in high spirits and full of energy. After a week of intensive attack, the more than 50,000 mu of Category Three seedlings have undergone significant changes. Everyone in the county participates, vigorously accumulating plant ash and stove soil, accumulating, transporting, and applying simultaneously, day and night, non-stop. More than 57,000 mu of wheat fields at risk of lodging have been applied with stove soil and plant ash. At the same time, the county has prepared more than 4 million jin of various pesticides to eliminate wheat diseases and pests. County, commune, team, and high-yield plots have established meteorological forecasting stations and pest monitoring groups. More than 10,000 wheat experts and technicians inspect daily, ensuring that people know before the weather changes, and pests move before people know, and if there is a disaster, prevention and control are implemented immediately.

    加水加肥　增穗增粒　防病灭虫　夺取丰收
    河北四川小麦管理精益求精
    河南等九省（区）防治锈病已达三千五百万亩
    蓬莱县块块麦田进行三查三补　偃师县再接再励消灭三类苗
    本报讯　近来由于气温上升，湿度增大，为害小麦的锈病、赤霉病、粘虫、麦蜘蛛等病虫发展很快。一个以灭锈为中心的护麦战役正在各地蓬勃开展。据河南、山东、河北、陕西、甘肃、江苏、安徽、福建、新疆等九省（区）不完全统计，防治和预防锈病面积已达三千五百万亩。
    本报讯　河北省广大群众，为夺取六十年代第一个夏季小麦大丰收，在全省掀起小麦超产赛，采用水肥技术一齐上的办法，猛攻小麦拔节关。
    为了夺取小麦全面均衡高产，各级党委在大抓丰产方的同时，都把狠抓一般田、三类麦、低产麦，作为当前突击任务，加强了对薄弱环节的领导。石家庄市为了保证把全部麦田管好，一方面确定一万六千名各级书记大抓三百七十二万亩丰产方；一方面组织了一千二百个专业队，在各级书记带领下，采取定点包干，对三类麦加强管理。安国县对六万亩三类苗采取偏肥偏水偏管后，已有70％升了级。
    在大抓小麦管理中，各地还采用领导、技术人员、老农三结合的办法，大搞四巧（巧追拔节肥、巧浇拔节水、巧中耕、巧除腐叶）、四防（防倒伏、防霜冻、防病害、防虫害）运动，力求小麦管理精益求精。为防止锈病蔓延成灾，全省建起二万八千多个锈病情报点，八万多名技术人员奋战田间开展防病除病害运动。现在不光有二百万亩麦田升了级，还大大促进了全省农田水利建设的步伐。到目前为止，麦田灌溉面积由2月份的二千三百六十万亩，扩大到二千六百多万亩，其中有一千九百万亩麦田达到地上水地下水双保险。
    据新华社讯　四川省二千五百多万亩小麦，普遍生长良好。各地党委发动群众进一步加强麦田后期管理，促使小麦粒满、粒饱、粒重，夺取更大的丰收。
    各地在麦田后期管理中特别注意防止倒伏。从3月下旬以来，四川盆地连续遭到低气温侵袭，广大干部和群众奋起和风雨搏斗。乐至县对未发生倒伏的地块，普遍培土一次，高产地培土两三次；对个别发生倒伏的地方，立即把麦苗轻轻扶起，按照逆风方向，在麦行间分层培土，使麦苗回复原状。
    各地还积极防治病虫害。今年四川省小麦锈病相当严重，一般发病率高达15％。内江、达县、万县、绵阳等四个专区采取联防协作的办法，各公社出动了一百九十多万人，彻底防治。江津专区病虫害严重的一百多万亩小麦，前后经过两三次防治，虫病已基本消灭。
    本报讯　山东省蓬莱县按照小麦生长规律，看天看地进行田间管理，巧夺小麦拔节关。
    各公社对麦田展开了“三查、三补、三灭”运动。三查是查验水分、肥分和病虫情况。三补是根据查验结果，按需要补水、补肥、补农药。三消灭是消灭弱苗、消灭旱田、消灭漏网的病虫害。在浇水方面的经验是：对丰产苗，凡是土壤含水量在15％以上，茎叶茂密，有倒伏趋势的，就推迟到基部一、二节间形成后浇水；土壤含水量不足15％的，仍然用小水急灌；含水量超过25％的，采取地边挖沟、追施灰肥，撒盖干沙的办法加以排除。一般麦田土壤含水量不足17％的马上补水。三类苗不易倒伏，连水施肥，促使迅速升级。
    各公社还为小麦抽穗、扬花、灌浆、结实作了一系列的准备工作，使麦田管理一环扣一环，一关接一关。据中共蓬莱县委分析，小麦抽穗、扬花、灌浆期是需要水分最多的时期，是病虫害最严重的时期，也是能否争取穗大粒多粒饱的关键时期。这个阶段管理的主要措施，是以水为主，磷肥为辅，加强四防（防锈病、防麦螟、防风、防倒伏）。扬花灌浆期，西南风很多，丰产麦浇水遇风就容易倒伏，不浇水又容易上旱干尖，影响攻粒，因此必须在扬花灌浆以前（也是大刮西南风以前）把水浇透。各公社都根据需要，积极储备水、肥、农药。
    本报讯　河南省偃师县抓紧小麦生长后期，又一次展开了以大抓三类苗、消灭“点片黄”为中心的全面加强麦田管理运动。
    全县五万多名麦田管理大军，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，经过一个星期的突击围攻，五万多亩三类苗，已有显著变化。全县人人动手，大积草木灰和灶土，边积、边运、边施，日夜不息，对有倒伏危险的麦田，已有五万七千多亩施入了灶土和草木灰。同时全县已为消灭小麦病虫害，准备各种农药四百多万斤。县、社、队、丰产方都建立了气象预报站、虫情测报组。一万多名小麦土专家、技术员每日检查，作到天变人先知，虫动人先晓，一有灾害，立即防治。（附图片）
