    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 31st dispatch: The Argentine people, in the national parliamentary elections held on March 27, expressed their serious dissatisfaction with the government's implementation of the "starvation plan" imposed by the International Monetary Fund by casting blank votes. According to figures released by the Ministry of the Interior, blank votes accounted for more than two million votes in this national parliamentary election, accounting for 25% of the votes. Compared with the national election in 1958, the number of blank votes increased by 180%.
    The call to cast blank votes by the Communist Party and the Peronist Party was supported in this election by people from all sides, including the split faction of the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union.
    Communist Party leader Gioldi, in a statement on the election results, pointed out that if those who supported casting blank votes had been able to conduct propaganda before the election, the number of blank votes nationwide would have reached 30%.
    The ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union received more than 1.7 million votes, a decrease of 2.2 million votes compared to the 1958 national election. The opposition People's Radical Civic Union received slightly more than 2 million votes, but this was also a decrease of nearly 500,000 votes compared to the votes it received in 1958.
    According to the figures released so far, the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union has lost 26 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, while the People's Radical Civic Union has gained 27 seats. Currently, the overall distribution of seats in the Chamber of Deputies is: Intransigent Radical Civic Union 107 seats, People's Radical Civic Union 79 seats, Conservative Party 5 seats, and Provincial Defence Party 1 seat. Thus, the ruling party has lost the two-thirds majority required to pass draft laws rejected by the Senate, although it retains a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
    Leaders of all political parties in Argentina agree that the election results show that the people oppose the government's policies, the economic plan imposed by the International Monetary Fund, and various measures to suppress democracy.
    Communist Party leader Gioldi said that the election results show that "the country demands an immediate end to martial law and the 'Conintes Plan', the release of political prisoners and labor leaders, and an end to the ban on political parties. The country demands the establishment of a civil government on the basis of broad democratic unity, and an end must be put to the situation in which the military manipulates power."

    阿根廷人民反对政府的现行政策
    议会选举中投空白票的人数增加执政党议席大量减少
    据新华社31日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷人民在3月27日举行的全国议会选举中，以投空白票的行动表示了他们对政府执行国际货币基金组织所强加的“饥饿计划”的严重不满。据内政部发表的数字，在这次全国议会选举中，空白票就占了二百多万张，占选票的25％。同1958年的全国选举比较，空白票增加了180％。
    共产党、庇隆主义党号召投空白票的主张，在这次选举中得到包括执政党不妥协激进公民联盟分裂派在内的各方面人士的支持。
    共产党领袖基奥迪就选举结果发表的谈话指出：拥护投空白票的人在选举前如果能够进行宣传，全国的空白票票数将达到30％。
    执政党不妥协激进公民联盟获得一百七十万多票，比1958年的全国选举时减少了二百二十万票。反对党人民激进公民联盟共获得二百万多一点的票，但是同它在1958年所得票数比较，也减少了将近五十万票。
    截至现在为止发表的数字，执政党不妥协激进公民联盟在众议院中失去了二十六席，而人民激进公民联盟增加了二十七席。现在，众议院的总的席位分配为：不妥协激进公民联盟一百零七席、人民激进公民联盟七十九席、保守党五席、保卫省份利益派一席。这样，执政党失去了为通过参议院所拒绝的法律草案的三分之二必要多数，虽然它在众议院中保持多数。
    阿根廷各政党领袖一致认为：选举结果表明，人民群众反对政府的政策、反对国际货币基金组织强加的经济计划和反对压制民主的种种措施。
    共产党领袖基奥迪说，选举结果表明，“全国要求立即停止戒严和‘科宁特斯计划’，释放政治犯和劳工领袖和结束对政党的禁令。全国要求在广泛民主联合的基础上成立民治政府，必须结束军队操纵大权的局面。”
