Comrade Chairman, fellow members:

I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong. I warmly endorse the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 made by Vice-Premier Li Fuchun and the report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft made by Vice-Premier Li Xiannian. These reports vividly summarize the rich experiences of China's national economy in achieving both high-speed and proportionate great leaps forward, and clearly point out the direction of continued leap forward development of China's national economy. This is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country. The Chinese people, nurtured and educated by Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in a period shorter than ten years, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) ahead of schedule.

Now I would like to report on the situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications sector.

Lenin said: Socialism is empty talk without machines and postal and telecommunications. In order to meet the needs of high-speed socialist construction for communications work, Chinese postal and telecommunications workers, like the vast number of workers, peasants, and intellectuals across the country, have held high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and Mao Zedong Thought. After victoriously completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, they immediately launched a magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They firmly believe that it is necessary to realize the great call put forward by the Party Central Committee in the shortest possible time, and to build a well-connected postal and telecommunications network dominated by modern tools in our country. At present, focusing on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, they are vigorously reforming tools and equipment, eliminating heavy manual labor and complicated manual operations, and are changing the technical appearance of enterprises and the mental outlook of employees with each passing day. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications sector has entered a new stage. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

I. Holding High the Red Flags of the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, Daring to Think, Speak, and Act, and Constantly Making Innovations and Creating Miracles

The vast number of employees firmly believe: following the Party means victory. Wherever the Party points, they rush there. They use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and guide their activities. They say: "Mao Zedong Thought has brightened our eyes and illuminated our hearts." "With politics in command, we are full of energy." Therefore, they have great determination and sufficient drive. If there are no materials, they find them themselves. If they do not understand technology, they learn it themselves. If there is no equipment, they build it themselves, and they will never bow to difficulties. They think about innovation while walking, they think about innovation while eating, and they even dream about innovation. And they propose: "Thousands of hearts, tens of thousands of hearts, everything for the Great Leap Forward," "Fear nothing in heaven or earth, be determined to achieve mechanization." They work without conditions, labor without compensation, and wholeheartedly want to make revolution. Therefore, they constantly create miracles in production. For example, in the postal and telecommunications infrastructure construction sector, soldering wire arcs is a relatively strenuous job. The soldering iron used for soldering wire arcs was originally straight and weighed more than one jin (approximately 0.5 kg), and only a little over a thousand heads could be soldered in a day. Workers changed the straight soldering iron to a curved soldering iron, and the output increased from a little over a thousand to three or four thousand. Then, they changed the curved soldering iron to a pistol-style soldering iron, and the weight of the soldering iron was reduced from more than one jin to about half a jin, and the output increased to more than five thousand heads. They continued to study diligently, changed manual tin dipping to automatic tin feeding, and the output increased to more than eight thousand heads. Recently, they changed the soldering iron head from one to five, and a soldering iron can solder five wire arcs at a time, and the output has greatly increased. The vast number of employees are using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon for developing production and improving working conditions, and through the practice of technical innovation and technical revolution, they have further realized the greatness and correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of continuous revolution.

II. The Movement is Wide in Scope, Large in Momentum, Rich in Content, and Significant in Effect

In terms of the scope of the movement, from the postal sector, where the proportion of manual operation is relatively large, to the telecommunications sector, where the degree of mechanization and automation is relatively high, from small bureaus to large bureaus, from production workers and technical personnel to management cadres and life service personnel, all have been involved in the movement, and a new situation of everyone making innovations, everywhere making innovations, and everything making innovations has emerged. In terms of the content of innovation, it has developed from operational innovations to tool and equipment innovations, from single innovations to complete and comprehensive innovations in a work type or a workshop, and from innovations within an enterprise to innovations throughout an entire postal route, an entire circuit, and an entire region. For example, in the entire postal route from Chengdu to Kangding, in order to shorten the overall time limit, the method of "dragon" ordering and planning, with simultaneous action across the entire line, was adopted. Seventy-three innovations were made on tools and equipment of various sizes, achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of mail loading and unloading and indoor transmission, motorization of short-distance transportation, and instrumented billing and weighing. This improved the efficiency of postal transport by 10%, increased the overall labor productivity by about 30%, and increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from the original 20% to 70%. In addition, it saved one-third of the labor force in loading and unloading work. As another example, the Xinxiang Prefectural Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Henan organized a collaborative network in the entire prefecture to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. They reformed equipment on their own and, in a very short period, realized the carrierization of circuits from the prefecture to the counties and 84% carrierization of circuits from the counties to the communes. Due to the widespread implementation of carrierization, the number of circuits from the prefecture to the counties increased from 58 to 175, and the number of circuits below the county level increased from 624 to 799. The prefectural postal and telecommunications bureau and each county postal and telecommunications bureau have four sets of telephone conferencing equipment and can hold four telephone conferences simultaneously. Every commune and 60% of production brigades can also hold telephone conferences. Technical innovation and technical revolution, from few to many, from rough to refined, from single items to complete sets, from individual enterprises to the entire route and entire network, this is the inevitable trend of the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications sector. The technical innovation and technical revolution of the entire route and entire network will inevitably accelerate the change of the technical appearance of postal and telecommunications production and the mental outlook of postal and telecommunications employees.

Due to continuous technological innovation, the proportion of manual operations and heavy manual labor that existed in large quantities in the postal and telecommunications production process has gradually decreased, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has continuously increased, and they are advancing towards automation and semi-automation, greatly reducing labor intensity, saving manpower, and improving communication efficiency. These achievements, in turn, have further encouraged the enthusiasm and diligence of the masses of employees. For example, the pole erecting machine made by postal and telecommunications workers in Guangdong Province reduced the operation from five people in the past to only one person, and greatly reduced heavy manual labor. Linemen praised: "Ten-meter poles are long and long, in the past, poles were carried by people, everyone's shoulders were often swollen, and sometimes there were work injuries; now the poles are erected mechanically, the sliding rope is pulled and it's perfect, the operation is safe and labor-saving, and heavy labor is transformed into ease." This fully reflects the happy mood of the employees.

Carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, continuously innovating technology, and developing production can not only continuously improve labor productivity, build socialism at high speed, and quickly get rid of our country's backwardness of being poor and blank; it can also save a lot of labor, support new enterprises, and reduce enterprise costs; at the same time, it can also liberate employees from heavy manual labor, thereby promoting continuous, extensive, and in-depth development.

III. Self-Reliance, Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, with Indigenous Methods as the Main Focus. Walking on Two Legs

Many innovation projects are realized by employees through self-reliance, using indigenous methods, and creating indigenous equipment. For example, the Changli County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province had neither lathes nor sufficient equipment, and even fewer engineering and technical personnel. They only had a few maintenance workers who had never seen carrier wave machines and a few pliers and files. They carried forward the spirit of self-reliance. Without iron powder cores, they refined them themselves using iron ore sand from the river. Without enameled wire, they disassembled coils from old telephone sets. Finally, they overcame various difficulties and produced the Changli-type single-channel carrier wave machine, which not only met the needs of telecommunications and communications in the county, but also supported various postal and telecommunications bureaus in the entire prefecture. As another example, old workers in the Shanghai Equipment Factory who manufactured parts for telex machines, after seventy-eight experiments, realized the replacement of manual operations with machinery, increasing efficiency by 102 times. This approach of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, is a high expression of the creative enthusiasm of the vast number of employees who have studied Mao Zedong Thought and carried forward the construction of socialism. Only by implementing the policy of self-reliance and walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, can the technical innovation and technical revolution movement be widely and deeply developed.

IV. Carrying Forward the Spirit of Communist Cooperation, Extensively Organizing a Three-Way Combination Inside and Outside the Enterprise

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the spirit of communist cooperation has been greatly promoted. Not only do postal and telecommunications enterprises conduct extensive cooperation internally and between enterprises, but they also link up with schools, scientific research institutions, and other factories and enterprises, closely cooperating to solve many major technical key problems.

"Give convenience to others and leave difficulties to ourselves," "Step forward when there are difficulties, give way when there is honor, learn from the advanced, and help the backward" has become the prevailing ethos, and many new phenomena have emerged, such as large helping small, old helping new, strong helping weak, visiting relatives and friends, moving troops, as well as sending equipment, sending technology, sending experience, and sending personnel. For example, after Comrade Li Rong, a model sorting worker at the Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, proposed the suggestion of creating an automatic sorting machine, not only did the bureau's leading cadres, engineers, carpenters, etc., actively participate in research or trial production; moreover, Comrade Su Guangming and Comrade Ding Yi, representatives of the National Congress of Heroes, labor models of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City, teachers and students of Harbin University of Technology, technicians of design institutes, reporters from newspapers, and the Harbin Youth Communist Assault Team also took the initiative to provide support. This spirit of communist cooperation is difficult to imagine under the capitalist system.

V. Implementing Technical Transformation of Rural Communication Networks and Vigorously Serving the Development of Agriculture

In order to meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation and the development of agriculture for communication work, the vast number of employees are working hard to develop and transform the rural postal and telecommunications network. Hebei Province transformed nearly 10,000 kilometers of communication networks in two months and built more than 2,000 kilometers of new telephone lines, connecting more than 4,000 production teams with telephones. The Changyuan and Linxian postal and telecommunications bureaus in Henan Province made eleven indigenous automobiles in less than a month to solve the problem of rural postal transport. The transformation of rural communication work has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of peasant brothers. A commune party secretary said: "Without conference calls, it would take three days to go back and forth for a meeting. With conference calls, things can be conveyed in an hour." The technical innovations of the postal and telecommunications sector have strongly supported the technical transformation of agriculture.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report that "the great march of our people to conquer backward technology has already begun throughout the country." "This movement will surely accelerate the process of industrial modernization, agricultural modernization, and scientific and cultural modernization in our country, further increase the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific, technological, and cultural level of the people." The practice of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of postal and telecommunications employees also fully proves this point. Under the correct leadership of the Party, under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of postal and telecommunications employees will surely be continuously consolidated, developed and improved, and move forward along the correct, scientific and mass-based path; this is a reliable guarantee for us to overfulfill the 1960 national plan and continue to make great leaps forward faster, better, and more economically.

    让祖国大地遍布邮电网
    中国邮电工会全国委员会主席李景韩的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的关于政治协商会议常务委员会的工作报告。热烈拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。这些报告生动地总结了我国国民经济既是高速度、又是按比例大跃进的丰富经验，又明确地指出了我国国民经济继续跃进的发展方向。这对全国人民是一个极大的鼓舞。在毛泽东思想培养教育下的中国人民，一定会在比十年更短的时间，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，并提前实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要。
    我现在汇报一下邮电部门技术革新和技术革命运动的情况。
    列宁说过：没有机器和邮电，社会主义就是空话。为了适应高速度建设社会主义对通信工作的需要，中国邮电工人，同全国广大工人、农民和知识分子一样，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社和毛泽东思想的红旗，在提前三年胜利完成第二个五年计划的主要指标以后，立即展开了波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。他们坚定地认为，必须在最短的时期内，实现党中央所提出的伟大号召，在我国建成以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网。目前正在以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心，大力改革工具设备，消灭笨重的体力劳动和繁杂的手工操作，日新月异地改变着企业的技术面貌和职工的精神面貌。邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动已经进入到一个新的阶段。这主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、高举总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，敢想敢说敢做，不断地闹革新创奇迹
    广大职工深信：跟着党走，就是胜利。党指向那里，就奔向那里。他们用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，指导自己的活动。他们说：“毛主席思想擦亮了我们的眼睛，照亮了我们的心。”
  “政治挂了帅，周身都是劲”。因此，决心大，干劲足，没有材料自己找，不懂技术自己学，没有设备自己造，决不向困难低头。走路想革新，吃饭想革新，甚至做梦也是在革新。并且提出：“千条心，万条心，一切为了大跃进”“天不怕，地不怕，一心要搞机械化。”他们工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，一心一意要闹革命，因此在生产中，不断地创奇迹。例如，在邮电基本建设部门，焊接线弧是比较吃力的作工。焊接线弧用的烙铁，原来是直的，有一斤多重，一天只能焊一千多个头。工人把直烙铁改为弯烙铁，产量就由一千多提高到三、四千；接着，又把弯烙铁改为手枪式烙铁，烙铁重量由一斤多减少到半斤左右，产量又提高到五千多头；他们继续刻苦钻研，把人工蘸锡改为自动给锡，产量又提高到八千多头；最近又把烙铁头由一个改为五个，一把烙铁一次能够焊接五个线弧，产量更大大提高了。广大职工就是这样用毛泽东思想作为发展生产和改善劳动条件的有力武器，而通过技术革新和技术革命运动的实践，他们更进一步体会到毛泽东同志不断革命论思想的伟大和正确。
    二、运动的范围广、声势大、内容丰富、效果显著
    就运动开展的范围来说，从手工操作比重比较大的邮政部门到机械化、自动化程度比较高的电信部门，从小局到大局，从生产工人、技术人员到管理干部、生活服务人员都卷入了运动，出现了人人闹革新、处处闹革新、事事闹革新的崭新局面。就革新的内容上看，已经由操作上的革新，发展为工具设备的革新，由单项的革新，发展为一个工种、一个车间的成套的、全面的革新，由一个企业内部的革新，发展为整条邮路、整条电路、整个地区全程全网的革新。例如，成都到康定整个邮路，为了缩短全程时限，采取全“龙”订规划，全线齐动手的办法，革新大小工具设备七十三项，实现了邮件装卸和室内传输机械化、半机械化、短途运输车子化、计费计重仪表化，使邮运时限效率提高了10％，全“龙”劳动生产率提高30％左右，机械化、半机械化程度由原来的20％提高到70％，并在装卸搬运工作上，节省了三分之一的人力。又如，河南新乡专署邮电局在全专区组织协作网大闹技术革新技术革命运动，自己动手改革设备，在很短的时期内，实现了专区至各县的电路载波化，县至公社84％的电路载波化。由于普遍实现了载波化，所以专署至县的电路由五十八条增为一百七十五条，县以下电路由六百二十四条增为七百九十九条；专署邮电局和每一个县邮电局都有四套电话会议设备，都能同时召开四个电话会议；每一个公社和60％的生产大队也都能召开电话会议。技术革新和技术革命，由少到多、由粗到精、由单项到成套、由个别企业到全程全网，这是邮电部门技术革新和技术革命运动发展的必然趋势。全程全网的技术革新和技术革命，又必然会加速改变邮电生产的技术面貌和邮电职工的精神面貌。
    由于不断地革新技术，邮电生产过程中大量存在的手工操作和笨重体力劳动的比重逐渐减少，机械化、半机械化程度不断提高，并向着自动化、半自动化进军，大大地减轻了劳动强度，节省了人力，提高了通信效能。这些成就反过来又进一步鼓舞了职工群众的干劲和钻劲。例如，广东省邮电职工制成的立杆机，由过去五人操作减少到只用一个人，并且大大减轻了笨重体力劳动。线务员歌颂说：“十米电杆长又长，过去立杆用人扛，人人肩头常发肿，有时还要出工伤；现在立杆机械化，滑绳一拉顶呱呱，操作安全又省工，笨重劳动化轻松。”这充分地反映出职工的愉快心情。
    开展技术革新和技术革命运动，不断地革新技术，发展生产，既能不断地提高劳动生产率，高速度建设社会主义，迅速摆脱我国一穷二白的落后面貌；又能节省大量的劳动力，支援新建企业，并降低企业成本；同时，还能使职工从笨重的体力劳动中获得解放，因而促使不断广泛深入地开展。
    三、自力更生，土洋并举，土法为主。两条腿走路
    许多革新项目，都是由职工群众自力更生，运用土办法，创造土设备来实现的。例如，河北昌黎县邮电局，既没有车床，也没有足够的器材，更没有工程技术人员，只有几个连载波机都没有看见过的机务员和几把钳子、锉刀，他们发扬了自力更生的精神，没有铁粉心，就用河里的铁矿砂自己炼，没有漆包线，就拆用旧电话机子上的线圈，终于克服了种种困难，制成了昌黎型的单路载波机，不仅满足了本县电信通讯的需要，而且支援了全专区的各个邮电局。又如，上海器材厂制造电传机零件的老工人，经过七十八次试验，实现了用机械代替手工操作，提高了工效一百零二倍。这种自力更生、土洋并举的作法，是广大职工学习了毛泽东思想，发扬了建设社会主义的创造积极性的高度表现。只有贯彻自力更生、土洋并举两条腿走路的方针，才能使技术革新和技术革命运动广泛深入的开展。
    四、发扬共产主义大协作的精神，广泛组织企业内外三结合
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，大大发扬了共产主义大协作的精神。不仅邮电企业内部、企业与企业之间大搞协作，而且还和学校、科学研究机关、其它工厂企业挂起钩来，紧密协作，解决了许多重大的技术关键问题。
  “把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”已成为风气，出现了很多大帮小、老帮新、强帮弱、走亲访友、走马换将，以及送设备、送技术、送经验、送人员等新气象。例如，哈尔滨邮电局劳动模范分拣员李荣同志，提出创造自动分拣机的建议以后，不仅局内的领导干部、工程师、木工等积极参加研究或试制；而且，全国群英会的代表苏广铭同志、丁一同志，黑龙江省和哈尔滨市的劳动模范，哈尔滨工业大学的教师和学员、设计院的技术员和报社记者以及哈尔滨市青年共产主义突击队，也都主动地支援。这种共产主义大协作的精神，在资本主义制度下，是很难想像的。
    五、实行农村通信网的技术改造，大力为发展农业服务
    为了适应农业技术改造和发展农业对通信工作的需要，广大职工正努力发展和改造农村邮电通信网。河北省在两个月时间，就改造了通信网路近一万公里，并新建了两千多公里的电话线路，给四千多个生产小队架通了电话。河南省长垣、林县等邮电局，为解决农村邮运问题，不到一个月时间，就制成了十一部土汽车。改造农村通信工作，受到广大农民兄弟的热烈欢迎。有的公社党委书记说：“没有会议电话，开个会来回需要三天，有了会议电话，有事一小时就传达下去了。”邮电部门的技术革新，有力地支援了农业的技术改造。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出“我国人民征服落后技术的伟大进军，已经在全国范围内开始发动起来了。”“这个运动必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平。”邮电职工的技术革新和技术革命运动的实践，也充分地证明了这一点。在党的正确领导下，在毛泽东思想和总路线的光辉旗帜下，邮电职工的技术革新和技术革命运动，一定会不断地巩固、发展和提高，并沿着正确的科学的全民的道路前进；这是我们超额完成1960年的国家计划，更加多快好省地继续大跃进的可靠保证。
