Introduction
    This program is a fighting program for rapidly developing agricultural productive forces during my country's First to Third Five-Year Plans, in order to strengthen my country's socialist industrialization and improve the living standards of farmers and all the people.
    Socialist industry is the leading force in my country's national economy. However, developing agriculture occupies an extremely important position in my country's socialist construction. Agriculture supplies industry with grain and raw materials, and at the same time, the rural areas with a population of more than 500 million provide my country's industry with the world's largest domestic market. From these points of view, without my country's agriculture, there would be no my country's industry. It is completely wrong to ignore the importance of work in agriculture.
    There can be two paths for developing agriculture. One is the capitalist road: letting the fate of farmers be controlled by landlords, rich peasants, and speculators, with a very few people getting rich and the majority being impoverished and constantly bankrupt. The other is the socialist road: letting farmers control their own destiny under the leadership of the working class, with common prosperity and common development. The struggle between these two roads will exist for a long time in my country's transition period, but due to the basic completion of agricultural cooperation, the vast majority of farmers in my country have already shaken off the former road and embarked on the latter road. The task from now on is to do everything possible to consolidate the cooperative system, while continuing to oppose the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside.
    Agricultural cooperation has opened up the broadest road for the development of agricultural productive forces in my country. Without agricultural cooperation, under the conditions of individual economy, the requirements for striving to achieve an average annual yield of 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu in several major different regions of the country within twelve years, with certain exceptions, and for striving to have the production and income of most cooperatives catch up with or exceed the level of local wealthy middle peasants when they were working individually during the Second Five-Year Plan period would be impossible fantasies. However, after agricultural cooperation, coupled with the great achievements of socialist industrialization in the First Five-Year Plan, and with everyone's efforts in every possible way in the future, the requirements put forward in the program have the possibility of being realized.
    Due to my country's generally good natural conditions, abundant rural labor force, and the excellent traditions of diligence and frugality and the rich experience of intensive cultivation among farmers, the agricultural economy has great potential. It is necessary to take various active and reasonable measures on the basis of cooperation, and to actively promote agricultural mechanization in a prepared and step-by-step manner in accordance with the situation, to fully tap this potential of agriculture, oppose conservatism, and fight for the realization of the requirements of the program.
    The improvement of agricultural production levels and the living standards of farmers mainly depends on the hard work of the farmers themselves. However, the people's government under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party always assists farmers as much as possible. The many agricultural production increase measures stipulated in the program will gradually receive more necessary assistance from the people's government in the future. In practice, this is the mutual support between workers and peasants, and the mutual support between urban and rural areas.
    The worker-peasant alliance led by the working class and the mutual support between workers and peasants is the guarantee of farmers' liberation. The bourgeois rightists and feudal remnants, for the purpose of restoring the landlord system and the capitalist system, tried their best to provoke the relationship between workers and peasants and the relationship between urban and rural areas. Their despicable provocation has failed and will continue to fail.
    It is necessary to educate the peasant masses to unify the concepts of loving the country, loving the community, and loving the family. Without the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasant masses would continue to be ruled and exploited by imperialists, landlords, rich peasants, and speculators, could not have their own cooperatives, and would continue to see many families destroyed. To love the family, one must love the country and love the community. All localism and individualism that disregard the interests of the state and the collective interests of the cooperative are wrong and will in fact harm the interests of one's own family.
    On the road of agricultural development, difficulties will continue to arise. However, man can conquer nature. For our liberated people, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Not being afraid of difficulties is the great character inherent in our working people.
    This program is proposed for the whole country. There are many differences in the situations of various localities and even various cooperatives. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs and cooperatives in all provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, and townships (ethnic townships) should, in accordance with this program, and in accordance with the specific conditions of the locality and the cooperative, seek truth from facts, go through the mass line, and separately formulate specific plans for the phased development of various tasks in the locality. At the same time, all economic departments, scientific, cultural, educational, health, and political and legal departments of the state should also, in accordance with this program, re-examine their own work plans.
    Among the various tasks described in this program, there are some tasks, such as greening, managing households frugally, eliminating rats, flies, and mosquitoes, eliminating the most serious diseases harming the people, and advocating planned childbearing, which urban residents should also implement, and must be carried out in coordination between urban and rural areas in order to be effectively realized.

Program

    (I) Consolidate the Agricultural Cooperative System

    Agricultural cooperation in my country has been basically completed in 1957. The task from now on is: to strive to consolidate all agricultural production cooperatives within the Second Five-Year Plan period, or a little longer.

    The conditions for consolidating cooperatives are: (1) In the leading elements of the cooperatives, maintain the advantage of the original poor peasants, hired peasants, and lower-middle peasants (mainly the current poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants), while also paying attention to ensuring that the upper-middle peasants also have appropriate representation. (2) Implement the policy of running the cooperatives democratically. The leading organs of the cooperatives should announce financial revenues and expenditures on time, cadres should consult with the masses on handling affairs, and participate in productive labor. (3) Implement the policy of running the cooperatives diligently and frugally. It is necessary to struggle against all phenomena of idleness and oppose extravagance and waste. (4) According to the economic situation of the cooperative and the local natural conditions, take various measures to increase production, gradually increase agricultural capital construction, ensure compliance with and completion of national plans, continuously expand reproduction, and strive to have most cooperatives catch up with or exceed the production level and income level of local wealthy middle peasants during the Second Five-Year Plan period. (5) Handle distribution issues rationally, taking into account the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members, and under the conditions of developing production and normal years, gradually increase the public accumulation of the cooperative and the income of the members, striving to have the income of the collective economy of the cooperative, plus the income from household sideline occupations of the members, on a per capita basis, catch up with or exceed the income of local wealthy middle peasants around 1962. (6) Strengthen political and ideological work, continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the members, overcome capitalist ideas, overcome localism and individualism that disregard the interests of the state and the collective interests of the cooperative; every year, in conjunction with the rectification of rural cadres and the rectification of cooperatives, systematically summarize the work of the year, and conduct a concentrated socialist education among all rural populations. In multi-ethnic areas, special attention should be paid to unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups.

    The existing, small number of elementary cooperatives should be guided to voluntarily transform into advanced cooperatives when conditions are ripe. Strengthen education and leadership over the few individual farmers that still exist, and strive to have them voluntarily join the cooperatives successively; those who do not want to join the cooperatives should be allowed to do so as they please.

    (II) Vigorously Increase the Yield of Grain and Other Crops

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, the average annual yield of grain per mu should be increased from more than 150 jin in 1955 to 400 jin in the areas north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, Bailong River, and Yellow River (within Qinghai); from 208 jin in 1955 to 500 jin in the areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River; and from 400 jin in 1955 to 800 jin in the areas south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River. The sandy areas, barren land areas, perennial drought and flood areas, high-altitude and cold mountainous areas, areas with very short frost-free periods, sparsely populated areas, and large-scale reclamation areas can separately stipulate production increase targets according to the situation.

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, the average annual yield of cotton per mu (lint) should be increased from 35 jin in 1955 (national average) to 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin, respectively, according to the conditions in various places.

    Under the condition of prioritizing the development of grain production, all localities should develop diversified agricultural economies, ensure the completion of the planned targets for textile raw materials (cotton, hemp, silkworm cocoons), oil crops (soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, oil tea, tung oil), sugar crops (sugarcane, sugar beets), tea, flue-cured tobacco, fruits, medicinal materials, and other crops stipulated by the state, and should also actively develop all other marketable cash crops. Areas with suitable conditions in South China should pay attention to the development of tropical and subtropical crops.

    Agricultural cooperatives should encourage members to grow vegetables and fodder on their private plots. Cooperatives and state farms in urban suburbs and near industrial and mining areas should grow vegetables according to the state's plans, and fully guarantee the supply of vegetables to cities and industrial and mining areas.

    (III) Develop Animal Husbandry

    The cooperativization of animal husbandry should stipulate different development plans according to the conditions in various places. Develop state-owned farms in a planned way.

    Vigorously protect and propagate livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, sheep, rabbits, and appropriately propagate various poultry. Pay special attention to protecting female livestock, young livestock, and breeding sires. Establish breeding stations to improve livestock breeds.

    In pastoral areas, protect grasslands, improve and cultivate forage, and pay special attention to developing water sources. Pastoral cooperatives should gradually establish their own feed and forage bases. Promote silage.

    Within seven or twelve years respectively, basically eliminate the most serious animal diseases, such as rinderpest, hog cholera, chicken plague, bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, pork cysticercosis, sheep pox, and sheep scabies, in all possible places. Before 1962, counties or districts in agricultural areas and districts or townships in pastoral areas should establish animal husbandry and veterinary work stations. Cooperatives should have personnel for basic prevention and control of animal epidemics. Give full play to the strength of folk veterinarians, organize and lead them to improve their skills, and participate in the prevention and control of animal epidemics.

    (IV) Implementing Increased Production Measures and Promoting Advanced Experiences are Two Basic Conditions for Increasing Crop Yields

    The items of production increase measures mainly include: (1) Building water conservancy projects. (2) Increasing fertilizers. (3) Improving old-fashioned farm tools and promoting new-style farm tools. (4) Promoting improved varieties. (5) Expanding the multiple cropping area. (6) Planting more high-yield crops. (7) Implementing intensive cultivation, improving farming methods. (8) Improving the soil. (9) Maintaining soil and water. (10) Protecting and propagating draught animals. (11) Eliminating pests and diseases. (12) Reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated land area.

    The methods for promoting advanced experiences mainly include: (1) Each province, municipality, and autonomous region collects local rich production experiences, compiles and prints them into books, and disseminates and promotes them. (2) Holding agricultural exhibitions. (3) Governments at all levels regularly convene meetings of agricultural labor models and reward rich production models. (4) Organizing visits and comparisons between cooperatives to exchange production increase experiences. (5) On the basis of summarizing advanced experiences, organizing technical instruction, and mobilizing farmers and cadres to learn from the advanced management experiences and technical knowledge of other cooperatives, other townships, other counties, and other provinces (autonomous regions).

    (V) Build Water Conservancy Projects, Develop Irrigation, and Prevent Waterlogging and Drought Disasters

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, the development of water conservancy in the country should focus on building small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, while also building necessary large-scale water conservancy projects where possible.

    Small-scale water conservancy projects (digging wells, digging ponds, building dikes, sinking dry wells, opening canals, building weirs, repairing reservoirs, building water storage and drainage ditch-levee-ridge-terrace systems, etc.), and the management of small rivers are all the responsibility of local governments and agricultural cooperatives, and should be carried out in a planned and as large-scale manner as possible. Through these tasks, combined with the construction of national large and medium-sized water conservancy projects and the management of large and medium-sized rivers, it is required to basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within twelve years.

    In areas with severe waterlogging disasters, vigorous efforts should be made to carry out engineering construction for flood drainage and transformation of low-lying areas.

    It is required to expand the area of paddy fields and irrigated land from more than 390 million mu in 1955 to about 900 million mu within twelve years. The drought resistance capacity of irrigation facilities should be increased to 30 to 50 days according to different conditions in various places; in areas suitable for the development of double-cropping rice, it should be increased to 50 to 70 days to ensure harvests. In order to make full use of all water sources, relevant departments should actively conduct surveys of groundwater to ensure the necessary data required by the water conservancy departments.

    Whenever water conservancy construction can generate electricity, small and medium-sized hydropower construction should be carried out simultaneously as much as possible, and rural electricity use should be gradually increased in conjunction with the construction of national large and medium-sized power projects.

  (VI) Vigorously Increase Farm Manure and Chemical Fertilizers

    Agricultural cooperatives should take all measures to meet their fertilizer needs as much as possible on their own. Special attention should be paid to raising pigs (and sheep in some places). With the exception of a few ethnic minority areas that do not raise pigs and a few families that do not raise pigs due to religious customs, it is required to reach an average of 1.5 to 2 pigs per household in rural areas by 1962, and 2.5 to 3 pigs per household in rural areas by 1967. Pig and sheep should have pens, and cattle and horses should have barns. In addition, various green manure crops should be actively developed according to local conditions, and urban and rural feces, garbage that can be used as fertilizer, and other miscellaneous fertilizers should be utilized as much as possible.

    The central and local governments should actively develop the manufacturing industry of chemical fertilizers, and strive to produce about 5 million to 7 million tons of chemical fertilizers by 1962, and about 15 million tons by 1967. Actively develop bacterial fertilizers.

  (VII) Improve Old-fashioned Farm Tools and Promote New-style Farm Tools

    According to production needs, and after regional adaptability tests and modifications, actively promote improved farm tools and new-style farm tools that are suitable for local conditions. Always pay attention to the maintenance and repair of farm tools. Strengthen technical guidance on the use of new-style farm tools.

    With the development of national industrialization, implement agricultural mechanization actively and step by step. Starting from 1956, within the shortest possible time, the machinery manufacturing department and the agricultural department should, through extensive experimental research work, formulate a plan for agricultural mechanization suitable for my country's conditions, prepare for the promotion of agricultural mechanization, and then manufacture machinery suitable for various places and supply it to farmers; improve it at any time, and actively promote it.

    (VIII) Actively Breed and Promote Improved Crop Varieties Suitable for Local Conditions

    It is required to popularize existing improved varieties of various crops through regional adaptability tests by 1962. For crops for which improved varieties have been basically popularized (such as cotton), work on seed rejuvenation and variety replacement should be strengthened. Vigorously cultivate new improved varieties, and pay attention to trial planting of improved varieties from other places and foreign countries.

    Agricultural cooperatives should establish their own seed plots, strengthen mass seed selection work, and establish a crop variety breeding and replacement system. In areas where harvests are often uncertain, attention should be paid to storing seeds of improved varieties. Central and local state-owned farms should become bases for breeding crop varieties, and actively breed and promote crop varieties suitable for local conditions. Each province (municipality, autonomous region), special district (autonomous prefecture), and county (autonomous county) should establish seed management agencies.

    (IX) Expand the Multiple Cropping Area

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, according to the different conditions in different regions, the multiple cropping index (including green manure crops) should be increased to the following levels:

  (1) Areas south of the Five Ridges, reaching about 230%. (2) Areas north of the Five Ridges and south of the Yangtze River, reaching about 200%. (3) Areas north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River, reaching about 160%. (4) Areas north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River, and south of the Great Wall, reaching about 120%. (5) Areas north of the Great Wall should generally utilize existing cultivated land as much as possible, reduce the area of abandoned land, and strive to expand the multiple cropping area where possible.

    (X) Plant More High-Yield Crops

    Utilize all possible water sources to increase the planting area of rice. Starting from 1956, it is required to increase rice by 250 million mu within twelve years. According to needs and food habits, appropriately develop high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes.

    (XI) Actively Improve Farming Methods According to Local Conditions

    All agricultural cooperatives should implement intensive cultivation, improve farming methods, fertilize rationally, irrigate rationally, and rotate crops rationally, intercrop, interplant, and plant densely.

    Do not violate the farming season, sow in time, weed and thin seedlings in time, strengthen field management, harvest in time, harvest carefully and cleanly, and strive for high and secure yields.

    (XII) Improve the Soil

    Agricultural cooperatives and state farms should actively improve and utilize saline-alkali land, barren red soil land, low-lying land, sandy land, and other various barren land. Pay attention to preventing soil salinization. Mountainous areas must actively repair terraced fields in a planned way. Use various methods to turn barren land into fertile good land.

    (XIII) Carry Out Soil and Water Conservation Work

    In areas with soil and water erosion, it is necessary to rely on agricultural cooperatives to widely mobilize the masses, combine with local production, and carry out soil and water conservation work in a step-by-step and planned way. Starting from 1956, it is required to achieve significant soil and water conservation effects in all possible places within twelve years, and gradually reduce the damage of soil erosion. In order to make this work achieve results more quickly, relevant departments such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and scientific research must closely coordinate and actively support under the unified leadership of the local Party and government organs.

    (XIV) Protect and Propagate Draught Animals

    Starting from 1956, it is required that every agricultural cooperative have a sufficient number of strong draught animals within seven to twelve years. To this end, it is necessary to produce enough forage and feed, and plant high-yield feed crops. Cooperatives should continuously improve the feeding and management of draught animals according to their own conditions. Cooperatives and the government should take correct measures to reward the breeding of draught animals.

    (XV) Prevent and Eliminate Pests and Diseases

    Starting from 1956, respectively within seven or twelve years, basically eliminate the most serious pests and diseases that harm crops, such as locusts, rice stem borers, armyworms, corn borers, cotton aphids, cotton red spiders, cotton bollworms, wheat sucking midges, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, sweet potato black spot disease, etc., in all possible places; at the same time, prevent the spread of other dangerous diseases, insect pests, and weeds. Each region should include other major pests and diseases that can be eliminated locally in the elimination plan. To this end, plant protection work and plant quarantine work must be strengthened.

    Plan to develop the production of pesticides and machinery, improve product quality, and improve supply work. At the same time, strengthen technical guidance on usage to ensure safety and effectiveness.

    (XVI) Reclaim Wasteland and Expand Cultivated Land Area

    The state should reclaim wasteland in a planned way. Starting from 1956, it is required to increase the cultivated land area of state-owned farms from more than 13 million mu in 1955 to about 100 million mu within twelve years. In areas with suitable conditions, migrants should be organized and cooperatives should be encouraged to organize branch societies or send out production teams to carry out wasteland reclamation. When reclaiming wasteland, it must be combined with soil and water conservation and animal husbandry development plans to avoid soil erosion, avoid damaging forests, and avoid damaging necessary grasslands. In places where forests have been damaged, efforts should be made to restore them.

    Agricultural cooperatives should make full use of all scattered land such as field ridges, corners of the land, pond sides, ditch edges, and vacant yards. This land can be allocated to production teams or individual members for management according to the situation.

    Industrial, mining, commercial, agricultural, and other enterprises, cultural, educational, health, water conservancy, transportation, military, and other departments and mass organizations must save land as much as possible during capital construction, and avoid and reduce the occupation of cultivated land as much as possible.

    (XVII) Develop Mountainous Area Economy

    In accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and implementing diversified management, develop the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and various local specialties in mountainous areas.

    Develop grain production in mountainous areas without damaging soil and water conservation. Areas that are still short of grain should strive to achieve grain self-sufficiency or reduce grain imports.

    In remote mountainous areas, focus on developing timber forests. In near mountainous areas, focus on developing special-purpose economic forests, fuelwood forests, various fruit trees, and local specialties. In the mountainous areas of the south, attention should be paid to developing oil tea, tung oil, bamboo, mulberry trees, tea trees, etc. In the mountainous areas of the north, attention should be paid to developing walnuts, oaks, prickly ash, etc.

    Develop medicinal material production. Pay attention to protecting wild medicinal materials and gradually carry out partial artificial cultivation according to possible conditions.

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, basically eliminate the most serious animal pests that harm mountain production in all possible places. Protect and develop wild animals with economic value.

    Special districts, counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas should formulate longer-term mountain production plans, rationally use land, and promote the overall development of production. Relevant state departments should provide strong coordination and support in terms of transportation, supply and marketing trade, culture and education, health, organizing migration, etc.

    (XVIII) Develop Forestry and Green All Possible Wasteland and Barren Hills

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, green wasteland and barren hills within the scope of permissible natural conditions and possible human management. Plant trees in a planned way in all housesides, villagesides, roadsides, and watersides, as long as it is possible. To this end, it is necessary to rely on agricultural cooperatives to plant trees and implement the policy of planting and owning by the society. It is required that the cooperatives collect seeds and cultivate seedlings themselves, and adopt the method of dividing responsibilities and contracting planting and survival. At the same time, encourage members to plant trees next to their own houses, planting and owning themselves.

    In addition to timber forests (including bamboo forests), planting trees should make full use of all manpower and urban and rural open spaces to develop economic forests such as fruit trees, mulberry, oak, tea, lacquer, and oil crops.

    Vigorously strengthen state-owned afforestation. State-owned forest farms mainly build large areas of timber forests, and also build soil and water conservation forests, windbreak forests, sand-prevention forests, and coastal defense forests in a planned way.

    The greening of railways, trunk highways, both sides of large rivers, around large reservoirs, and near mines is the responsibility of the railway, transportation, water conservancy departments, and factories and mines, and the income belongs to the respective operating departments; it can also be operated by nearby agricultural cooperatives, planting trees according to the specifications set by the relevant departments, and the income belongs to the cooperatives.

    Greening land should not occupy cultivated land.

    It is required to manage all state-owned forests as much as possible within twelve years. Small-scale state-owned forests that are inconvenient for the state to manage should be entrusted to cooperatives for management. It is necessary to protect and cherish forest resources, strengthen fire prevention work, prevent and control pests and diseases, prevent deforestation and waste of timber in logging, and promptly update logging sites to restore forests.

    (XIX) Develop Marine and Freshwater Aquatic Product Production and Aquaculture

    In marine fisheries, on the basis of cooperativization, the potential of existing fishing gear should be utilized, and production technology should be gradually improved. Attention should be paid to increasing public accumulation, adding and improving production tools, and gradually developing motorized sailing vessels and ships. Strengthen safety measures in production and strive to develop towards the deep sea. Utilize all possible water surfaces for fish farming to develop freshwater aquaculture. Strengthen the cultivation of excellent fish species and the prevention and control of fish plagues. Actively develop shallow sea aquaculture, strengthen the breeding of fish, algae, and shellfish.

    (XX) Run State Farms Well

    All state-owned farms are required to unite and help the surrounding agricultural cooperatives and play their due demonstration role in production technology. State-owned farms should implement diversified management and improve labor utilization; continuously improve production technology and labor management, and improve labor productivity. It is necessary to practice strict economy, implement the policy of running farms diligently and frugally, improve the wage system, and increase output and reduce costs.

    (XXI) Improve Agricultural Scientific Research and Technical Guidance

    Establish and improve institutions for agricultural scientific research and technical guidance according to needs and possible conditions, such as the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, regional and specialized agricultural scientific research institutes, provincial agricultural experiment stations, county demonstration and breeding farms, and agricultural technology service stations, so that agricultural scientific research can better serve the development of agricultural production.

    Agricultural scientific research and technical guidance must be closely integrated with the production practice of the peasant masses. It is necessary to summarize the production increase experience of local farmers, especially old farmers, and learn from the good experiences in agricultural production in other places. Staff members of county agricultural technology service stations should select key farms and agricultural cooperatives as work bases and participate in agricultural production.

    Starting from 1956, within twelve years, train junior and middle-level technical talents for agricultural cooperatives from among farmers with considerable production experience and a certain level of education to meet the needs of cooperative economic development.

    (XXII) Strengthen Meteorological and Hydrological Work

    Starting from 1956, basically build meteorological station networks and hydrological observation station networks within twelve years. Strengthen weather forecasting, especially the work of hazardous weather forecasting. Establish agricultural meteorological forecasting work. All localities should pay attention to listening to broadcasts about meteorology in order to prevent natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and freezing.

    (XXIII) Run Cooperatives Diligently and Manage Households Frugally

    All agricultural cooperatives must implement the principle of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Diligence means mobilizing members to work hard in production, actively expanding the scope of production, developing diversified economies, and carrying out meticulous work under possible and necessary conditions. Frugality means practicing strict economy, reducing production costs, and opposing extravagance and waste. All kinds of capital construction in cooperatives should make full use of the cooperatives' own manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible.

    Farmers should be educated to manage their households diligently and frugally, make long-term plans, and arrange various household expenses in a planned way. Women's organizations in rural areas should regard educating women to manage their households diligently and frugally and do a good job in household labor as an important task. Pay attention to introducing exemplary cases of farmers' careful calculations, thrift, increasing savings, and accumulation. The idea of ​​not making long-term plans, not paying attention to family accumulation, and eating and spending everything at any time is wrong.

    Weddings, funerals, and social interactions in rural areas should be simplified as much as possible, and the original unreasonable customs should be changed.

    (XXIV) Increase the Labor Utilization Rate and Labor Productivity of Agricultural Cooperatives, and Develop Diversified Economy

    In order to fully develop agriculture and sideline occupations such as forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, as well as rural handicrafts, strive to expand production avenues, and increase social wealth and the income of rural people, agricultural cooperatives should increase the labor utilization rate. The north should try to increase winter production. At the same time, production technology should be actively improved, labor organization and labor management should be improved, and the labor productivity of members should be continuously improved.

    Starting from 1956, it is required that every male full labor force in rural areas work at least about 250 days a year within seven years. According to the characteristics of women, arrange and organize female labor rationally. In addition to the time spent on household labor, each rural female full labor force is required to participate in agricultural and sideline (including household sideline) production labor for no less than 80 to 180 days a year within seven years, according to different conditions in different regions. In addition, for all people with semi-labor force or people who can engage in light labor in rural areas, the cooperative should make appropriate arrangements and require them to actively participate in labor suitable for their abilities.

    (XXV) Store Grain

    All agricultural cooperatives, except for grain-deficient societies that mainly operate in mountains and forests or operate cash crops, are required to formulate specific plans according to their own situation, and add grain reserves of the members' families, and store enough surplus grain for three months, half a year, one year or one and a half years to meet the needs of emergencies within twelve years from 1956. In areas where harvests are often uncertain and transportation is inconvenient, special attention should be paid to using good harvests to make up for bad harvests, and storing grain to prevent famine.

    Starting from 1956, the state should store enough grain for one to two years for emergency needs within twelve years.

    (XXVI) Improve Living Conditions

    With the development of cooperative production and the increase in members' income, agricultural cooperatives should, according to needs and possibilities, encourage and assist members to repair and build new family homes in a prepared, planned, phased manner, under the principles of voluntariness, mutual assistance, saving expenses, and saving land, and improve the living conditions of members.

    (XXVII) Eliminate the Four Pests

    这个纲要是在我国第一个到第三个五年计划期间，为着迅速发展农业生产力，以便加强我国社会主义工业化、提高农民以及全体人民生活水平的一个斗争纲领。
    社会主义工业是我国国民经济的领导力量。但是，发展农业在我国社会主义建设中占有极重大的地位。农业用粮食和原料供应工业，同时，有五亿以上人口的农村，给我国工业提供了世界上的最巨大的国内市场。从这些说来，没有我国的农业，便没有我国的工业。忽视农业方面工作的重要性是完全错误的。
    发展农业可以有两条道路。一条是资本主义道路：让农民的命运掌握在地主、富农和投机商人的手里，极少数人发财而大多数人贫困和不断破产。一条是社会主义道路：让农民在工人阶级的领导下掌握自己的命运，共同富裕和共同繁荣。这两条道路的斗争在我国过渡时期中将长期地存在，但是，由于农业合作化的基本完成，我国绝大多数农民已经摆脱了前一条道路，走上后一条道路。今后的任务是要尽力巩固合作化制度，同时继续反对农村中的资本主义自发势力。
    农业合作化给我国农业生产力的发展开辟了最广阔的道路。没有农业合作化，在个体经济的条件下，关于在十二年内在全国几个主要不同地区的粮食，除掉某些例外，争取每亩平均年产量分别达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求，关于在第二个五年计划时期内争取大多数合作社的生产和收入赶上或者超过当地富裕中农在单干时候的水平的要求，这些都是不可能实现的幻想。但是，在农业合作化以后，加上第一个五年计划中社会主义工业化的伟大成就，经过今后大家千方百计的努力，纲要所提出的这些要求，便有着实现的可能性。
    由于我国一般的自然条件好，农村劳动力多，农民有勤劳节俭的优良传统和精耕细作的丰富经验，农业经济有很大的潜在力量。必须在合作化的基础上，采取各种积极的合理的措施，并且有准备地有步骤地适合情况地积极推广农业的机械化，充分发掘农业的这种潜在力量，反对保守主义，为着实现纲要的要求而斗争。
    农业生产水平和农民生活水平的提高，主要依靠农民自己的辛勤劳动。但是，在工人阶级和共产党领导下的人民政府总是尽可能援助农民的。纲要所规定的许多农业增产措施，今后将逐步得到人民政府的更多的必要的援助。在实际上，这是工农的互相支援，城乡的互相支援。
    以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟和工农互相支援，是农民解放的保证。资产阶级右派分子和封建残余分子为了恢复地主制度和资本主义制度的目的，极力挑拨工农关系和城乡关系。他们这种卑鄙的挑拨失败了，并且还要继续失败下去。
    要教育农民群众把爱国、爱社和爱家的观念统一起来。没有共产党领导下的中华人民共和国，农民群众就将继续受帝国主义者和地主、富农、投机商人的统治和剥削，就不能有自己的合作社，就将继续出现许多家破人亡的局面。要爱家就得要爱国爱社。一切不顾国家利益和合作社集体利益的本位主义和个人主义，都是错误的，实际结果都将是危害自己家庭利益的。
    在农业发展的道路上，困难还是会继续出现的。但是，事在人为。对于我们解放了的人民来说，没有什么困难不能克服。不怕困难，是我们劳动人民本来的伟大性格。
    本纲要是就全国的范围提出的。各地方以至各合作社的情况存在着许多的差别。因此，全国各省（市、自治区）、专区（自治州）、县（自治县）、区、乡（民族乡）的党政领导机关和合作社，都应当根据本纲要，按照本地方、本合作社的具体条件，实事求是，经过群众路线，分别拟定本地方的各项工作的分批分期发展的具体规划。同时，国家各个经济部门，各个科学、文化、教育、卫生部门和政法部门，也都应当根据本纲要，重新审订自己的工作规划。
    本纲要所述各项任务中，有一些任务，例如绿化，勤俭持家，消灭老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子，消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，提倡有计划地生育子女等，城市居民也应当实行，并且一定要城乡配合进行才能有效地实现。
            纲　要
    （一）巩固农业合作化制度
    我国的农业合作化已经在一九五七年基本完成。今后的任务是：争取在第二个五年计划时间内，或者更多一点时间，把所有的农业生产合作社巩固起来。
    巩固合作社的条件是：（1）在合作社的领导成分中，保持原来的贫雇农和下中农（主要是现在的贫农和新中农中间的下中农）的优势，同时注意使上中农也有适当的代表。（2）贯彻执行民主办社的方针。合作社领导机关要按时公布财务收支，干部要同群众商量办事，参加生产劳动。（3）贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。要同一切游手好闲的现象作斗争，反对铺张浪费。（4）根据合作社的经济情况和当地的自然情况，采取各种增产措施，逐步地增加农业基本建设，保证遵守和完成国家的计划，不断地扩大再生产，争取在第二个五年计划时期内，使大多数合作社赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。（5）合理地处理分配问题，兼顾国家、合作社、社员三方面的利益，在发展生产和正常年景的情况下，使合作社的公共积累和社员的收入逐年有所增加，争取在一九六二年前后，合作社集体经济的收入，加上社员家庭副业收入，按人口平均，赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的收入。（6）加强政治思想工作，不断地提高社员的社会主义觉悟，克服资本主义思想，克服不顾国家利益和合作社集体利益的本位主义思想和个人主义思想；每年应当结合农村干部的整风和合作社的整社，系统地总结本年度的工作，在全体农村人口中集中地进行一次社会主义教育。在多民族的地区，要特别注意民族间的团结和互助。
    现有的、数目不多的初级合作社，在条件成熟了的时候，应当引导它们自愿地转为高级合作社。加强对现在还存在的少数个体农民的教育和领导，争取他们自愿地陆续加入合作社；不愿入社的，听其自便。
    （二）大力提高粮食的产量和其他农作物的产量
    从一九五六年开始，在十二年内，粮食每亩平均年产量，在黄河、秦岭、白龙江、黄河（青海境内）以北地区，由一九五五年的一百五十多斤增加到四百斤；黄河以南、淮河以北地区，由一九五五年的二百零八斤增加到五百斤；淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，由一九五五年的四百斤增加到八百斤。其中的沙荒地区、土地瘠薄地区、常年旱涝地区、高寒山区、无霜期很短地区、地广人稀地区、大面积垦荒地区，可以按照情况，另外规定增产指标。
    从一九五六年开始，在十二年内，棉花每亩平均年产量（皮棉），由一九五五年的三十五斤（全国平均数），按照各地情况，分别增加到四十斤、六十斤、八十斤和一百斤。
    在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，各地应当发展农业的多种经济，保证完成国家所规定的纺织原料（棉花、麻类、蚕茧），油料（大豆、花生、油菜籽、芝麻、油茶、油桐），糖料（甘蔗、甜菜），茶叶，烤烟，果类，药材等项农作物的计划指标，还应当积极地发展其他一切有销路的经济作物。华南各省有条件的地区，应当注意发展热带和亚热带作物。
    农业合作社应当鼓励社员在自留地上种植蔬菜和饲料。城市郊区和工矿区附近的合作社和国营农场，应当按照国家的计划种植蔬菜，充分地保证城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应。
    （三）发展畜牧业
    畜牧业的合作化，应当按照各地情况，分别规定不同的发展计划。有计划地发展国营牧场。
    大力保护和繁殖牛、马、驴、骡、骆驼、猪、羊、兔等家畜和适当地繁殖各种家禽。特别注意保护母畜、幼畜和种公畜。建立配种站，改良畜种。
    在牧区要保护草原，改良和培植牧草，特别注意开辟水源。牧业合作社应当逐步建立自己的饲料和饲草的基地。推广青贮饲料。
    分别在七年或者十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭危害牲畜最严重的病疫，例如牛瘟、猪瘟、鸡瘟、牛肺疫、口蹄疫、猪囊虫、羊痘、羊疥癣等。在一九六二年以前，农业区的县或者区和牧业区的区或者乡，应当建立起畜牧兽医工作站。合作社应当有初级的防治兽疫的人员。充分发挥民间兽医人员的力量，组织和领导他们提高技术，参加防治兽疫的工作。
    （四）推行增产措施和推广先进经验，是增加农作物产量的两个基本条件
    增产措施的项目，主要是：（1）兴修水利。（2）增加肥料。（3）改良旧式农具和推广新式农具。（4）推广优良品种。（5）扩大复种面积。（6）多种高产作物。（7）实行精耕细作，改进耕作方法。（8）改良土壤。（9）保持水土。（10）保护和繁殖耕畜。（11）消灭虫害和病害。（12）开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。
    推广先进经验的方法，主要是：（1）由各省、市、自治区收集当地的丰产经验，编印成书，传播推广。（2）举办农业展览会。（3）各级政府定期召开农业劳动模范会议，奖励丰产模范。（4）组织合作社之间的参观和评比，交流增产经验。（5）在总结先进经验的基础上，组织技术传授，发动农民和干部学习外社外乡外县外省（自治区）的先进的管理经验和技术知识。
    （五）兴修水利，发展灌溉，防治水旱灾害
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，全国水利事业的发展，应当以修建中小型水利工程为主，同时修建必要的可能的大型水利工程。
    小型水利工程（打井、挖塘、筑堤、打旱井、开渠、筑圩、修水库、兴修蓄水排水的沟洫畦田台田系统等），小河的治理，都由地方和农业合作社负责，有计划地尽可能大量地进行。通过这些工作，结合国家大中型水利工程的建设和大、中河流的治理，要求在十二年内，基本上消灭普通的水灾和旱灾。
    内涝灾害严重的地区，应该大力进行除涝排水、改造洼地的工程建设。
    要求在十二年内，把水田和水浇地的面积，由一九五五年的三亿九千多万亩扩大到九亿亩左右。灌溉设施的抗旱能力，按各地不同情况，分别提高到三十天到五十天；适宜发展双季稻的地方，要提高到五十天到七十天，以保证收成。为了充分利用一切水源，有关部门应当积极进行对地下水的勘察工作，保证水利部门所需要的必要资料。
    凡是能够发电的水利建设，应当尽可能同时进行中小型的水电建设，结合国家大中型的电力工程建设，逐步增加农村用电。
  （六）大力增加农家肥料和化学肥料
    农业合作社要采取一切办法，尽可能由自己解决肥料的需要。应当特别注意养猪（有些地方养羊）。除了某些不养猪的少数民族地区和因为宗教习惯不养猪的少数家庭以外，要求一九六二年达到农村平均每户养猪一头半到两头，一九六七年达到农村平均每户养猪二头半到三头。要做到猪羊有圈，牛马有栏。还应当因地制宜地积极发展各种绿肥作物，并且把城乡的粪便，可作肥料的垃圾和其他杂肥尽量利用起来。
    中央和地方都应当积极发展化学肥料的制造工业，争取到一九六二年生产化学肥料五百万吨到七百万吨左右，一九六七年生产一千五百万吨左右。积极发展细菌肥料。
  （七）改良旧式农具，推广新式农具
    根据生产的需要，经过地区适应性的试验和改制，积极推广那些适合当地条件的改良农具和新式农具。经常注意农具的保养和修理的工作。加强新式农具使用的技术指导。
    随着国家工业化的发展，有步骤地积极地实行农业机械化。从一九五六年起，在尽可能短的时间内，机械制造部门和农业部门应当经过广泛的试验研究工作，拟出一个适合我国条件的农业机械化方案，为推广农业机械化做好准备，随即制造适合各地的机械，供应农民；随时改良，积极推广。
    （八）积极繁育和推广适合当地条件的农作物优良品种
    要求在一九六二年以前，经过地区适应性的典型试验，普及各种农作物现有的优良品种。对于良种已经基本上普及的作物（例如棉花），应当加强种子复壮和品种更换的工作。大力培育新的良种，并且注意试种外地和外国的良种。
    农业合作社应当建立自己的种子地，加强群众的选种工作，建立农作物良种繁育更换制度。在丰歉经常不定的地区，要注意储备优良品种的种子。中央和地方的国营农场应当成为繁育农作物良种的基地，积极繁殖和推广适合当地的农作物良种。各省（市、自治区）、专区（自治州）、县（自治县）都应当建立种子管理机构。
    （九）扩大复种面积
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，按照不同地区的不同条件，把复种指数（包括绿肥作物在内）分别提高到下列的水平：
  （1）五岭以南地区，达到百分之二百三十左右。（2）五岭以北、长江以南地区，达到百分之二百左右。（3）长江以北，黄河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，达到百分之一百六十左右。（4）黄河、秦岭、白龙江以北，长城以南地区，达到百分之一百二十左右。（5）长城以北地区，一般应当尽可能地利用已有耕地，减少撩荒面积，在可能的地方，力争扩大复种面积。
    （十）多种高产作物
    利用一切可能利用的水源，增加稻谷的种植面积。从一九五六年起，在十二年内，要求增加稻谷二亿五千万亩。根据需要和民食习惯，适当地发展玉米和薯类等高产作物。
    （十一）积极地因地制宜地改进耕作方法
    一切农业合作社都应当实行精耕细作，改进耕作方法，合理地施肥，合理地灌溉，合理地轮作（换茬）、间作、套种和密植。
    不违农时，及时播种，及时锄草间苗，加强田间管理，及时收获，细收净打，力求丰产保收。
    （十二）改良土壤
    农业合作社和国营农场都应当积极改良和利用盐碱地、瘠薄的红土壤地、低洼地、砂地和其他各种瘠薄的土地。注意防止土地的盐碱化。山地必须有计划地积极地整修梯田。用各种办法把瘠薄的土地变成肥沃的良田好地。
    （十三）开展保持水土的工作
    在有水土冲刷的地区，应当依靠农业合作社，广泛地发动群众，结合当地的生产，有步骤有计划地开展保持水土的工作。从一九五六年起，要求在十二年内，在一切可能的地方，显著地收到保持水土的功效，逐步减少水土流失的损害。为使此项工作能够较快地收到效果，农业、林业、水利、牧业和科学研究等有关部门，必须在当地党政机关的统一领导下，密切配合，积极支援。
    （十四）保护和繁殖耕畜
    从一九五六年起，要求在七年到十二年的时间内，每一个农业合作社都要有足够数量的强壮的耕畜。为此，必须生产足够的饲草、饲料，种植高产饲料作物。合作社应当根据自己的条件，不断地改进耕畜的饲养管理工作。合作社和政府应当采取正确的措施奖励耕畜的繁殖。
    （十五）防治和消灭病虫害
    从一九五六年起，分别在七年或者十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭危害农作物最严重的虫害和病害，例如蝗虫、稻螟虫、粘虫、玉米螟虫、棉蚜虫、棉红蜘蛛、棉红铃虫、小麦吸浆虫、麦类黑穗病、小麦线虫病、甘薯黑斑病等；同时防止其他危险性的病害、虫害、杂草的传播蔓延。各地区应当把当地其他可能消灭的主要虫害和病害，列入消灭计划之内。为此，必须加强植物保护工作和植物检疫工作。
    有计划地发展农药和药械的生产，提高产品质量，改进供应工作。同时，加强使用上的技术指导，保证安全有效。
    （十六）开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积
    国家应当有计划地开垦荒地。从一九五六年起，在十二年内，要求国营农场的耕地面积由一九五五年的一千三百多万亩增加到一亿亩左右。在有条件的地方，应当组织移民和鼓励合作社组织分社或者派出生产队，进行垦荒。在垦荒的时候，必须同保持水土和发展畜牧业的规划相结合，避免水土流失，避免破坏树林和破坏必需的草原。在树林已经遭到破坏的地方，应当努力恢复。
    农业合作社应当充分利用田埂、地角、塘边、沟沿、空闲的场院等一切零星的土地。这些土地可以根据情况，分配给生产队或者社员个人经营。
    工矿、商业、农业等企业，文教、卫生、水利、交通、军事等部门和群众团体，在进行基本建设的时候，都必须尽量节省用地，尽量避免和减少占用耕地。
    （十七）发展山区经济
    按照因地制宜、实行多种经营的方针，发展山区的农业、林业、畜牧业和各种土特产的生产。
    在不破坏水土保持的原则下，发展山区的粮食生产。现在还缺粮的地区，应当争取作到粮食自给，或者减少粮食调进。
    远山区，应当着重发展用材林。近山区，应当着重发展特用经济林、薪炭林、各种果木和土特产。南方的山区，应当注意发展油茶、油桐、竹子、桑树、茶树等。北方的山区，应当注意发展核桃、柞树、花椒等。
    发展药材生产。注意保护野生药材，并且根据可能条件逐步进行部分的人工栽培。
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭危害山区生产最严重的兽害。保护和发展有经济价值的野生动物。
    山区、半山区的专区、县、乡和农业合作社，都应当制定较长期的山区生产规划，合理地使用土地，促进生产的全面发展。国家各有关部门，应当从交通运输、供销贸易、文教卫生、组织移民等方面作有力的配合和支援。
    （十八）发展林业，绿化一切可能绿化的荒地荒山
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，在自然条件许可和人力可能经营的范围内，绿化荒地荒山。在一切宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁，只要是可能的，都要有计划地种起树来。为此，必须依靠农业合作社造林，实行社种社有的政策。要求合作社自己采集树籽和培育树苗，采取分工负责、包栽包活的办法。同时，鼓励社员在自己的宅旁种树，自种自有。
    种树，除了用材林（包括竹林）以外，应当尽量利用一切人力和城乡空地，发展果木、桑、柞、茶、漆、油料等经济林木。
    大力加强国营造林。国营林场以营造大片用材林为主，并且有计划地营造水土保持林、防风林、防沙林和海防林。
    铁路、干线公路和大河流两旁、大型水库周围、矿山附近的绿化，由铁路、交通、水利部门和厂矿负责经营，收益归各经营部门；也可以由附近的农业合作社经营，按照有关部门所定的规格造林，收益归合作社。
    绿化用地，不应当占用耕地。
    要求在十二年内，尽可能地把国有森林全部经营管理起来。国家不便经营管理的小规模的国有林，应当委托合作社经营管理。必须保护和爱惜森林资源，加强防火工作，防治虫害和病害，制止滥伐和采伐当中浪费木材的现象，并且及时更新采伐迹地，恢复森林。
    （十九）发展海洋和淡水的水产品生产和水产养殖业
    在海洋渔业中，应当在合作化的基础上，发挥现有捕捞工具的潜力，逐步改进生产技术。应当注意增加公共积累，添置和改良生产工具，逐步发展机帆船和轮船。加强生产的安全措施，争取向深海发展。利用一切可能养鱼的水面，发展淡水养殖业。加强培育优良鱼种和防治鱼瘟的工作。积极发展浅海养殖业，加强鱼类、藻类、贝类的养殖。
    （二十）办好国营农场
    要求所有的国营农场，团结和帮助周围的农业合作社，在生产技术方面发挥应有的示范作用。国营农场应当实行多种经营，提高劳动力利用率；不断地改进生产技术和劳动管理，提高劳动生产率。必须厉行节约，贯彻执行勤俭办农场的方针，改善工资制度，既要增加产量，又要降低成本。
    （二十一）改善农业科学研究工作和技术指导工作
    根据需要和可能条件，建立和改进农业科学研究工作和技术指导工作的机构，例如农业科学院，区域性的和专业性的农业科学研究所，省的农业试验站，县的示范繁殖农场和农业技术服务站等，使农业科学研究工作更好地为发展农业生产服务。
    农业科学研究和技术指导，必须同农民群众的生产实践密切地结合起来。必须总结当地农民特别是老农的增产经验，学习其他地方农业生产上的好经验。县的农业技术服务站的工作人员，都应当分别选择重点的农场和农业合作社作为工作的基地，参加农业生产。
    从一九五六年开始，在十二年内，要从具有相当生产经验和一定文化程度的农民中间，为农业合作社培养初级的和中级的技术人材，以适应合作经济发展的需要。
    （二十二）加强气象水文工作
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，基本上建成气象台站网和水文观测站网。加强天气预报，特别是危险天气预报的工作。建立农业气象预报的工作。各地应当注意收听关于气象的广播，以便预防水、旱、风、冻等自然灾害。
    （二十三）勤俭办社，勤俭持家
    一切农业合作社都必须实行勤俭办社的原则。勤，就是要发动社员勤劳生产，在可能和必要条件下积极地扩大生产范围，发展多种经济，进行细致工作。俭，就是要厉行节约，降低生产成本，反对铺张浪费。合作社的各种基本建设，都应当尽量利用合作社本身的人力、物力和财力。
    应当教育农民勤俭持家，长远打算，有计划地安排各项家务开支。农村中的妇女团体，应当把教育妇女勤俭持家，作好家务劳动，当作自己的一项重要任务。注意介绍农家精打细算、省吃俭用、增加积蓄和积累的模范事例。不作长远打算、不注意家庭积累、随时吃光用光的思想，是错误的。
    农村中的红白喜事、人情应酬，应当一切从简，改变原来不合理的风俗习惯。
    （二十四）提高农业合作社的劳动力利用率和劳动生产率，发展多种经济
    为了充分发展农业和林、牧、渔等副业以及农村手工业，努力扩大生产门路，增加社会财富和农村人民的收入，农业合作社应当提高劳动力的利用率。北方要设法增加冬季生产。同时，还应当积极改进生产技术，改善劳动组织和劳动管理，不断地提高社员的劳动生产率。
    从一九五六年开始，在七年内，要求做到农村中的每一个男子全劳动力每年至少做二百五十天左右的工作。根据妇女的特点，合理地安排和组织妇女劳动力。妇女除了从事家务劳动的时间以外，在七年内，根据不同地区的不同情况，要求做到每一个农村女子全劳动力每年参加农业和副业（包括家庭副业）生产劳动的时间不少于八十天到一百八十天。此外，对于农村中一切具有半劳动力的人们，或者能够从事轻微劳动的人们，合作社应当作好适当的安排，要求他们积极地分别参加适合自己能力的劳动。
    （二十五）储备粮食
    要求一切农业合作社，除了主要是经营山林或者经营经济作物的缺粮社以外，从一九五六年起，在十二年内，按照自己的情况，定出具体计划，加上社员家庭的粮食储备，分别储积足够三个月、半年、一年或者一年半食用的余粮，以备紧急时候的需要。在丰歉经常不定和交通不便的地区，特别要注意以丰补歉，积谷防荒。
    从一九五六年起，在十二年内，国家应当储备足够一年到两年之用的粮食，以应急需。
    （二十六）改善居住条件
    随着合作社生产的发展和社员收入的增加，农业合作社应当根据需要和可能，鼓励和协助社员，在自愿、互助、节约开支和节省用地的原则下，有准备地、有计划地、分批分期地修缮和新建家庭住宅，改善社员的居住条件。
    （二十七）除四害
