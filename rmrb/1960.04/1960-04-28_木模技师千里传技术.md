    Wood Pattern Technician Transmits Skills Over a Thousand Li

    Everyone knows that we workers have a habit: we don't like our hands to be idle. In the Mao Zedong era, we workers were even more "old in age, but not in spirit!" After I retired, I was really bored! Last year, the Guangzhou Zhongshan Agricultural Machinery Factory transferred me to be a technical instructor. When I arrived at that factory, I was assigned to the wood pattern workshop. There were nine workers in that workshop, with only two masters, and the young men were full of energy. I thought, I must teach all my skills to the workers there. The young men were quick-witted, and they understood as soon as I explained, and their skills improved quickly. The wood pattern group leader has already been promoted from a fifth-grade worker to a sixth-grade worker. When I was leaving, they said to me: "Master Zhang doesn't mind the hardship, transmitting skills over a thousand li, we really should learn from you."

    This time I am going to Ningxia to participate in construction again, which really makes me happy. I will tell them all the techniques and production experience I know and complete the glorious task assigned to me by the Party.

    木模技师千里传技术
    谁都知道，我们工人有个脾气，就是手不愿闲着。在毛泽东时代，我们工人更是“人老、心不老”。我退休后，真闷的慌啊！去年广州中山农业机械厂调我去作技术指导。我到那个厂，分配到木模车间。那个车间有九名工人，师傅只有两名，小伙子们劲头都挺足。我想，一定要把技术全教给那里工人。小伙子脑子灵，我一说他们就懂，技术提高得挺快。木模组长已由五级工升到六级。临走时他们对我说：“张师傅不辞劳苦，千里传技术，我们真应该向你学习。”
    这次我又到宁夏参加建设，真叫我高兴。我要把我知道的技术和生产经验都告诉给他们，完成党交给我的光荣任务。
