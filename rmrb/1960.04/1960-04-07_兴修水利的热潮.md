　　**High Tide of Water Conservancy Construction**
　　*Our Correspondent* Li Cheng
　　One day in March, our jeep sped along the rural road on the banks of the Danube, bumping towards the area where the members of the agricultural production cooperative were digging canals.
　　Petko Borisov, chairman of the "Golden Horn" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Vidin Oblast, led us to the fields about two li from Kutovo village. Jumping out of the car, we were immediately presented with a moving scene: dozens of cooperative members were working hard, some swinging pickaxes to dig the earth, some using iron shovels to excavate the soil, and some, in pairs, using earth rammers to reinforce the bottom and sides of the canal... The newly turned soil exuded a moist, refreshing aroma.
　　The tall and sturdy Chairman Borisov proudly told us: "The members of our agricultural cooperative understand that to increase harvests, we must vigorously expand the area of irrigated land. Therefore, whether it snows or rains, many people automatically request to continue working..."
　　Last year, the members of agricultural production cooperatives across Bulgaria transformed the winter slack season into a busy season, braving the severe cold to build reservoirs and dig canals. By the end of last October, they had already converted two million decares (each decare equals one and a half mu) of dry land into irrigated land, exceeding the water conservancy construction tasks stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This created an unprecedented miracle in the history of water conservancy construction in Bulgaria. From last November, the members of agricultural production cooperatives across the country threw themselves into a new battle: to convert another two million decares of dry land into irrigated land. Last winter and this spring, members of many agricultural cooperatives across the country continued to maintain their high enthusiasm for labor, braving the cold wind and rain and insisting on working in the fields. The members of the "Golden Horn" Agricultural Production Cooperative are a good example of this. Here, on the banks of the Danube, they are creating astonishing miracles.
　　The "Golden Horn" Agricultural Production Cooperative is composed of 2,014 peasant households from six villages, owning 78,000 decares of cultivated land. The main source of income for the cooperative is crops. Before 1958, the cooperative only had 800 decares of irrigated land (all vegetable garden land). But last year, unprecedented changes occurred: in one year, the members excavated 441,000 cubic meters of earth, built 887 kilometers of canals of various sizes, and brought in water from the Danube River supplied by the pumping stations built by the state on the banks of the Danube. The area of irrigated land in the cooperative jumped to 33,000 decares, more than 41 times that of 1958. Due to the adoption of measures such as vigorously building water conservancy projects, applying more fertilizer, selecting improved varieties, and deep plowing, crop yields have greatly increased. Last year, the total income of the cooperative reached more than 40 million levs, nearly double that of 1958. The members personally experienced the benefits of water conservancy construction and their enthusiasm became even higher. Last winter and this spring, an average of 300 to 800 members carried pickaxes, iron shovels, earth rammers and other tools to the fields to dig canals every day. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule and surpass the target, sometimes members used lights to repair canals at night until late at night, and the fields were illuminated by the light of kerosene lamps. In the two months from the beginning of January to the beginning of March this year alone, they built 40 kilometers of canals and excavated 31,000 cubic meters of earth. The members proposed: they must expand the irrigated area of the cooperative to 62,000 decares before the watering season in May this year, which is nearly double that of last year! It is estimated that by the beginning of 1962, the irrigated area of the cooperative will reach 76,000 decares.
　　At the construction site, we met A. Kalikov, a very strong old member who was using an iron shovel to dig the soil. He is already sixty-two years old. When I asked him why he was so actively participating in labor, he replied:
　　"I want to set an example for the young people. What I have been thinking about for decades has now been realized, how can I not participate! This is the benefit of socialism."
　　What old man Kalikov said is absolutely true. Only the socialist system provides broad possibilities for the rapid development of production.
　　In the Kutovo Agricultural Production Cooperative, in Vidin Oblast, we once again deeply realized the great role of the vast number of members in water conservancy construction.
　　Vidin Oblast is located on the banks of the Danube River in northwestern Bulgaria. Xi Beshkov, Secretary of the Vidin Oblast Party Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, told reporters that before October 1958, that is, before the Bulgarian Communist Party put forward the slogan of accelerating economic development, the water conservancy construction plan for the entire state only included one irrigation system that could irrigate 150,000 decares – the Vidin Irrigation System. The pumping stations, main canals and branch canals of this irrigation system were all built by the state. At that time, it was estimated that the entire project would not be completed until 1962. This means that by 1962, the irrigated area of the entire state could reach 150,000 decares.
　　In November of the year before last, under the encouragement of the slogan of accelerating economic development put forward by the Bulgarian Communist Party, the vast number of members of agricultural cooperatives in Bulgaria merged small cooperatives into large cooperatives, urgently demanding to accelerate the development of water conservancy and improve crop yields. The state promptly met this reasonable demand of the vast number of people and decided to hand over some of the water conservancy construction tasks undertaken by the state to agricultural cooperatives. In this way, a vigorous mass water conservancy construction movement was launched across the country. Like other parts of the country, the face of water conservancy work in Vidin Oblast has been completely renewed. At present, there are six irrigation systems under construction and about to be started. 60% of these irrigation system projects are undertaken by agricultural cooperatives, built with the funds of agricultural cooperatives and the labor of members, and the state provides some long-term loans. In addition, agricultural cooperatives throughout the state also plan to build 58 small reservoirs to supplement the shortcomings of these irrigation systems.
　　Due to the launch of a mass water conservancy construction movement, the irrigated area of the entire state reached 155,000 decares last year, more than three times that of 1958, exceeding the past planned target for 1962. It is estimated that by the end of 1965, the irrigated area of the entire state will reach more than one million decares, equivalent to 84% of the total cultivated area of the entire state. When Bulgarian comrades talked about these amazing achievements, they all said in unison: "This is all the result of giving full play to the strength of agricultural cooperatives..."
　　The materials published in the newspapers and periodicals here tell us that the tasks and scale of water conservancy construction in Bulgaria this year are roughly the same as last year, that is, another 2 million decares of irrigated land will be added. The members of agricultural cooperatives are still the main force on the water conservancy construction front. The reservoirs, canals, pumping stations, etc. that they plan to build this year will be able to irrigate more than 1.73 million decares, accounting for more than 80% of the total water conservancy construction task in the country. It is estimated that by the end of 1965, the irrigated area of Bulgaria will reach 20 million decares, equivalent to more than 40% of the total cultivated area of the country.
　　We recently saw in some agricultural cooperatives in Bulgaria that the members' enthusiasm for labor is very high, and everywhere is filled with unlimited confidence in the future. These situations show that the huge task of water conservancy construction facing Bulgaria will definitely be completed.

    兴修水利的热潮
    本报记者　李成
    三月里的一天，我们乘坐的吉普车开足马力，在多瑙河沿岸农村的大车道上颠簸着，向农业生产合作社社员们挖水渠的地方驶去。
    维定州“金角”农业生产合作社主席别特科·鲍里索夫，带领我们来到离库托沃村约二里远的田野上。跳出车子，在我们面前立即展现出一幅动人的图景：几十个社员正在紧张地劳动，有的挥着十字镐掘土，有的用铁铣挖土，有的两人一组用捣土锤加固渠底和渠身……。刚刚翻起的新土，散发着一股湿润润的、令人心旷神怡的气息。
    高大魁梧的鲍里索夫主席自豪地对我们说：“我们农业社的社员们明白，要增加收成，就要大力扩大水浇地面积，因此无论下雪或下雨，都有很多人自动要求继续工作……。”
    去年，保加利亚全国农业生产合作社社员们，变冬闲为忙季，冒着严寒，修水库，挖水渠。到去年10月底，他们已经把二百万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一亩半）旱地变成了水浇地，提前三年超额完成了第三个五年计划规定的兴修水利任务，创造了保加利亚兴修水利史上从未有过的奇迹，从去年11月起，全国农业生产合作社的社员们又投入了新的战斗：再把二百万狄卡尔旱地变成水浇地。去冬今春，全国不少农业社的社员们继续保持高涨的劳动热情，冒着寒风雨雪，坚持在田野上劳动。“金角”农业生产合作社的社员们，就是这样的一个好例子。他们在这里，在多瑙河畔，创造着惊人的奇迹。
    “金角”农业生产合作社是由六个村子的二千零一十四户农民组成的，拥有七万八千狄卡尔耕地。全社收入的主要来源是农作物。全社在1958年以前，仅有八百狄卡尔水浇地（都是菜园地）。而去年却发生了空前的变化：社员们在一年之内，就挖了四十四万一千立方米土方，修起了长达八百八十七公里的大小渠道，引来了多瑙河岸国家修建的抽水机站供给的多瑙河的水，使全社水浇地面积一跃而增加到三万三千狄卡尔，比1958年增加了四十一倍还多。由于采取了大力兴修水利、多施肥、选用良种、深耕等措施，农作物产量大大增长了。去年全社的总收入达四千万列弗以上，比1958年增加了将近一倍。社员们亲身体会到了兴修水利的好处，积极性更高了。去冬今春，平均每天有三百到八百个社员扛着十字镐、铁铣、捣土锤等工具，到田野里挖水渠。为了提前和超额完成任务，有时社员们晚上带灯修水渠，直到深夜，田野上闪耀着煤油灯的光亮。仅从今年1月初到3月初的两个月中，他们就修起了四十公里长的渠道，挖了三万一千立方米土方。社员们提出：一定要在今年5月浇水季前，使全社水浇地面积扩大到六万两千狄卡尔，即比去年增加近一倍！预计，到1962年初，全社水浇地面积将达七万六千狄卡尔。
    在工地上，我们遇到了正在用铁铣挖土的一个身体十分健壮的老社员阿·卡里科夫。他已经有六十二岁了。当我问到他为什么这样积极参加劳动时，他回答道：
    “我要给年轻的人们作个榜样。过去想了几十年的事，现在实现了，我怎能不参加！这是社会主义的好处。”
    卡里科夫老大爷的话是千真万确的，只有社会主义制度才为生产的飞速发展提供了广泛的可能性。
    我们在库托沃农业生产合作社，在维定州，又一次深刻地体会到了广大社员在兴修水利中的重大作用。
    维定州位于保加利亚西北部的多瑙河沿岸。保共维定州党委书记席·别什科夫对记者说，1958年10月以前，即保共提出加速经济发展口号前，全州的兴修水利计划中，只包括一个能浇地十五万狄卡尔的灌溉系统——维定灌溉系统。这个灌溉系统的抽水机站、干渠和支渠全部由国家负责修建，当时预计全部工程要到1962年才能完成。这就是说，到1962年，全州的水浇地面积才能达到十五万狄卡尔。
    前年11月，保加利亚广大农业社社员，在保共提出的加速经济发展口号的鼓舞下，把小社并成了大社，迫切要求加速发展水利，提高农作物产量。国家及时满足了广大群众的这一合理要求，决定把国家担负的一些兴修水利任务交由农业社来完成。这样一来，全国就展开了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的兴修水利运动。与全国其他地方一样，维定州水利工作的面貌焕然一新。目前，正在修建和即将动工兴建的灌溉系统共有六个。这些灌溉系统工程的60％都由农业社负责，用农业社的资金和社员的劳动修建，国家给予一部分长期贷款。另外，全州农业社还计划修建五十八个小水库，补充这些灌溉系统的不足。
    由于展开了群众性的兴修水利运动，去年全州的水浇地面积已达到十五万五千狄卡尔，比1958年增加了三倍多，超过了过去计划的1962年的指标。预计，到1965年底，全州的水浇地面积将达一百万狄卡尔以上，相当于全州耕地总面积的84％。保加利亚的同志们谈起这些惊人的成就时，都异口同声地说：“这都是发挥了农业社的力量的结果……。”
    这里的报刊公布的材料告诉我们，今年保加利亚全国兴修水利的任务和规模与去年大体相同，即再增加二百万狄卡尔水浇地。农业社的社员们仍然是兴修水利战线上的主力军。他们今年计划修建的水库、水渠、抽水机站等将能浇地一百七十三万狄卡尔以上，为全国兴修水利总任务的80％以上。预计到1965年底，保加利亚全国的水浇地面积将达两千万狄卡尔，相当于全国耕地总面积的40％以上。
    我们最近在保加利亚的一些农业社访问时看到，社员们的劳动热情很高，到处洋溢着对未来的无限信心。这些情况表明，保加利亚面临的兴修水利的巨大任务一定能够完成。
