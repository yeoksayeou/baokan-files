    Decisions Made Beside the Machine
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Pei

    The sparks of the technological revolution are igniting in one corner after another. For these sparks to become a raging prairie fire, they need the wind to fan them. The creations of the masses in the technological revolution need to sprout everywhere, and they need the enthusiastic support, appreciation, and promotion of leaders.

    In one factory, the manual operations used for years were overthrown by the hands of the masses. Machines replaced manual labor, and a revolution—a qualitative leap—was completed. However, this is not yet a complete victory for the revolution. Only by rapidly extending the revolution to the entire industry and the entire region along the breakthrough that has been opened up can productivity leap to a new height.

    Promoting, rapidly promoting every revolutionary creation of the masses can quickly transform individual advanced levels into societal levels, fundamentally changing the face of our production technology.

    For many of us, promoting advanced experiences is not a new topic. However, whether it is immediately effective and quickly yields results depends on the method of leadership.

    We can adopt methods such as listening to reports, where comrades from the factory talk about their creative projects, and then compare, select, and adopt them. For example, we can read books and listen to reports, then hold meetings to discuss and make some kind of decision on promotion. These are all methods that can be used and are effective in many situations. However, when the storm of technological revolution roars, is there a better and faster method for the leaders of a region? Yes, and that is to go to the places where the revolution is at its height, to the masses who are fighting against old technologies and old tools. Discuss and decide right there. Here, the reporter would like to introduce an example of adopting this method of promotion.

    At the end of March, Fuzhou City, at the mouth of the Min River, is the season when hundreds of flowers are in bloom. In Jiangnan, osmanthus only fragrant in September, but here, the fragrance of osmanthus is already wafting. But today, the center of people's attention is not these. Like other cities across the country, the flowers of technological revolution are blooming in every corner here.

    A group of us came to the Taijiang Bamboo Factory by the Min River. If you use a fixed standard to measure the appearance of this factory, then you are very likely to think that this is just a simple shed and not a factory. The sheds are covered with bamboo mats, and there are no glass windows. The ground is mud, and there is no cement. It was in such a poor and small bamboo factory that a surprising sudden change occurred at the beginning of March: from the ancient manual production passed down from generation to generation, it entered the process of full mechanization in five days. The workload of 522 people was replaced by 46 people, and labor efficiency increased from two to forty times.

    If you came to this factory at the end of February, the main production tools you would have seen were still 53 bamboo knives, used to saw, split, and crack bamboo. The power to use the bamboo knives was people's hands. In some processes, hands were not enough, and teeth had to be used. Our bamboo workers used this simple production method to make high-quality bamboo products. But this slow and laborious work was not very pleasant for people after all. Bamboo workers were often cut by bamboo splints until their hands bled. Because they also used their teeth as tools, some workers' teeth also fell out. People have long thought about abandoning it. The idea of revolution was churning in the hearts of the bamboo workers. Like any revolution, the revolutionary desire often needs to be matched by a revolutionary situation in order to produce thorough and rapid revolutionary action. At the end of February, the spring tide of the technological revolution surged to this small bamboo factory. Workers rose up and fought fiercely for five days and nights. The 53 bamboo knives and the workers' hands bid farewell. The teeth of the machine replaced the teeth of the people. The first goal of the revolution—mechanization—was achieved. The time was only five days, but the difficulties were more than five. Any machine, even if it doesn't use steel, has to use iron, but there was very little iron. Wherever there is the Communist Party, there is the power to overcome difficulties. We can't not have a revolution just because there is no iron. Bamboo workers have to make indigenous machines even with bamboo. Sure enough, they succeeded in some processes. This is how the revolution is carried out. It is indigenous, but it has multiplied productivity. As long as you give it steel one day, it can immediately become a fully foreign machine.

    The director of this factory led us on a tour while narrating the factory's technological revolution history, which had just passed a few days ago. We walked through one workshop after another, and we saw thick bamboo poles, as thick as bowls, being split into smooth, thin strips of bamboo, as thin as paper tape, by machines. The workers sat easily next to the machines and worked skillfully. The traces of the old and backward production methods seemed to have disappeared overnight.

    One of the visitors listened carefully to the process of this technological transformation, carefully observed the new production tools, and gave a high evaluation: "This is a great revolution in bamboo production." He was Comrade Ye Fei, the First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and also the initiator of our visit. "It's not enough to just listen to reports and hold meetings in the office. You must run to see it, and you will understand it after seeing it, and you will be able to raise questions." This is his proposition. Therefore, for several days in a row, he visited several factories, together with the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, as well as the First Secretaries of the Prefectural and Municipal Party Committees, watching and talking.

    We finished watching in the bamboo factory. There is no doubt that the revolution has triumphed in this factory. But the mechanization of one Taijiang Bamboo Factory alone cannot fundamentally change the face of bamboo production in the entire Fujian Province. How much bamboo is there in Fujian? You don't have to go to the deep mountains. If you take a train on the Yingxia Railway, you will see large areas of lush green bamboo forests stretching continuously on the mountains on both sides. The revolutionary experience of the Taijiang Bamboo Factory should be extended to all bamboo factories. Everyone agrees with this. But how to promote it? Communicating, visiting, and holding meetings are all necessary methods, but these are not enough. We must also add a revolutionary method: make a decision to promote it quickly right next to the machine.

    "If you produce the bamboo machinery and equipment you created in batches and in complete sets, is it possible?" Comrade Ye Fei asked the factory director.

    "Yes, but we need to add some equipment."

    "How much equipment do you need?"

    "Six machine tools will be enough."

    Comrade Ye Fei immediately found the Director of the Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry, who had come with him, and told him to add six machine tools to this bamboo factory. A decision was made next to the machine: this bamboo factory, which had only been mechanized for a few days, would be attached to a bamboo machinery and equipment manufacturing factory. This year, complete sets of bamboo machinery and equipment will be manufactured for all counties in the province in the first half of the year, and then manufactured and supplied to rural people's communes in the second half of the year. The revolutionary seeds of Fuzhou Taijiang Bamboo Factory will blossom and bear fruit in all places in Fujian where bamboo grows, and the fundamental change in the face of manual bamboo production throughout the province can be expected.

    As a reporter, I also thought of Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces with dense bamboo forests. The bamboo workers there may have already realized a revolution like the Fuzhou Taijiang Bamboo Factory. What if they haven't? Then, the bamboo workers in Fuzhou have already set an example, and it will be easier to start a revolution.

    Go to the places where the revolutionary high tide is, watch and talk, and if possible and necessary, quickly make a decision to promote it, so that a spark can quickly become a prairie fire. This is the leadership method of the mass line, and it is also a leadership method that adapts to the requirements of high speed.

    We have all experienced many revolutionary upsurges. In each revolutionary upsurge, the wisdom and strength of the revolutionary masses often exceed our estimates and expectations. Therefore, leaders often have the possibility of falling behind the masses. However, leaders must stand at the forefront of the masses. How to do this? Go to the place where the revolution is happening, go to the fighting masses, go there more to see, and you will be able to discover problems and find the basis and ways to solve problems. In that way, the leader will be in an active position, and will be able to always keep ahead of the masses, leading the masses to constantly advance from one peak to another.

### 在机器旁边做出的决定

    在机器旁边做出的决定
    本报记者　张沛
    技术革命的火苗，在一个角落又一个角落燃起来。火苗，要成为熊熊的燎原大火，需要风力助长。技术革命中群众的创造，要处处发芽，需要领导者的热情支持、赞赏和推广。
    在一个工厂里，多少年来袭用的手工操作被群众的双手打倒了，机械代替了手工，革命——质的飞跃完成了。然而，这还不是革命的全盘胜利。只有迅速地沿着被打开的突破口，把革命普及到整个行业，整个地区，才能使生产力跳跃到一个新的高度。
    推广，高速度地推广每一项群众的革命性的创造，就能够迅速地把个别的先进水平，变为全社会的水平，从根本上改变我们的生产技术面貌。
    推广先进经验，对于我们许多人来说，这并不是一个陌生的题目。然而，是不是立竿见影，速见成效，这里面却有一个领导方法问题。
    我们可以采用这样一些方法。比如，听汇报，由工厂里的同志谈谈他们创造的项目，加以比较选择和采纳。比如，看书听报告，然后开会讨论，再作出某种推广的决定。这些，都是可以运用的方法，在许多情况下都是有效的方法。但是，在技术革命的风暴呼啸而至的时候，对于一个地区的领导者来说，还有没有其它更好更快的方法呢？有的，这就是到革命高潮的地方去，到和旧技术旧工具作战的群众中去。就在那儿讨论、决定。这里，记者想介绍采取这种推广方法的一个例子。
    3月的末梢，闽江口的福州城正是百花盛开的季节。江南，丹桂在9月里才飘香，而这里，桂花香现在就扑鼻而来。但是，今天人们注意的中心不是这些。像全国其它城市一样，这里的每个角落都盛开着技术革命的花朵。
    我们一群人来到了闽江边的台江竹材厂。如果你用一个固定的标准来衡量这个工厂的外形，那末，你极可能认为这只是一个简陋的工棚，算不上是个工厂。一间间竹席盖的天棚，连个玻璃窗也没有。地是泥土地，连水泥也没有铺。就在这样一个又穷又小的竹材厂中，在3月初，出现了惊人的突变：从祖祖辈辈世代相传的古老的手工生产，在五天中间，进入了全程机械化。五百二十二人的工作量，被四十六个人代替了，劳动效率提高了两倍到四十倍。
    如果你在2月底来到这个工厂，你看到的主要的生产工具，还只是五十三把竹刀，用来锯竹、破竹、裂竹。使用竹刀的动力是人们的双手。在有些工序上，双手不行还要加上牙齿咬。我们的竹材工人，就是用这种简单的生产方法，做出了质量优良的竹器。可是这种缓慢的、吃力的劳动，对于人们来说，毕竟不是很愉快的。竹材工人经常被竹篦刺得手破血流。由于把牙齿也当作工具，一些工人的牙齿也脱落了。人们久已想到要抛弃它。革命的念头在竹材工人的心中翻腾着。就像任何革命一样，革命的愿望常常要有一种革命的形势相配合，才能产生彻底的迅速的革命行动。2月底，技术革命的春潮，涌到了这个小小的竹材厂，工人们揭竿而起，激战五昼夜，五十三把竹刀和工人的双手告别了。机械的牙齿代替了人的牙齿。革命的第一个目标——机械化实现了。时间只有五天，但困难却不只五个。任何机械，不用钢材也得用铁料呵，但是铁料少得很。有共产党的地方就有克服困难的力量，不能因为没有铁料就不革命，竹材工人用竹子也要做出土机械。果然在一些工序上做成了。革命就是这样革法的，它土，但是它成倍地提高了生产率，只要有一天你给它钢铁，它就能马上变成十足的洋机器。
    这个工厂的厂长，一边领着我们参观，一边向我们叙述这个工厂刚刚过去没有几天的技术革命史。我们沿着一个车间一个车间地走着，我们看到一根根粗如碗口的竹子被一道道的机械劈成光滑的细薄如纸带的竹片。工人们轻松地坐在机器旁边熟练地劳动着，旧的落后的生产方法的痕迹，似乎在一夜之间消失了。
    在我们这批访问者中的一个人，他仔细倾听着这场技术改革的过程，仔细地观察着新的生产工具，并且作出了高度的评价：“这是竹材生产的大革命。”他就是中共福建省委的第一书记叶飞同志，也是我们这次访问的倡导者。“只是在办公室听汇报、开会不够，一定要跑去看，看了就明白了，就能提出问题了。”这是他的主张。因此一连几天他看了好几个工厂，和他一起的有省委的负责同志，也有地委、市委的第一书记，一边看，一边谈。
    我们在竹材厂看完了。毫无疑问，革命在这个厂子得胜了。可是光一个台江竹材厂机械化，还不可能根本改变整个福建省竹材生产的面貌。福建省多少竹子呵，不用到深山中去，你乘着鹰厦铁路的火车，就会看到两旁的大山上绵延不断的一大片一大片翠绿的竹林。应当把台江竹材厂的革命经验推广到所有的竹材厂去，这是所有人都赞成的。可是怎样推广呢？传达、参观、开会，这些都是必要的方法，然而这还不够，还要加上一个革命的方法：就在机器旁边作出迅速推广的决定。
    “如果你们成批地成套地生产你们创造的竹材机械设备，可不可以？”叶飞同志问这个工厂的厂长。
    “可以，但要增加一些设备。”
    “要多少设备？”
    “有六部机床就行了。”
    叶飞同志马上把一起来的省机械工业厅厅长找来，告诉他给这个竹材厂增加六部机床。一个决定在机器旁边产生了：这个刚刚机械化没有几天的竹材厂，要附设一个竹材机械设备制造厂。今年上半年就要给全省各县制造成套的竹材机械设备，下半年再给农村人民公社制造供应。福州台江竹材厂的革命种子，就要在福建所有生长竹子的地方开花结实了，根本改变全省竹材生产手工操作的面貌可以预期了。
    作为一个记者，我还想到江西、四川、云南等那些竹林茂密的省份。那里的竹材工人，很可能已经实现了像福州台江竹材厂一样的革命。如果还没有呢？那末，福州的竹材工人已经做出了样子，革起命来也比较容易了。
    到革命高潮的地方去，一边看，一边谈，有可能和需要的话，就迅速做出推广的决定，让一处火苗，很快变成燎原的大火，这是群众路线的领导方法，也是适应高速度要求的领导方法。
    我们都经历过多次的革命高潮，在每一次革命高潮中，革命群众的智慧和力量，常常超出我们的估计和预料。因而领导者也就常常有可能落在群众的后面。可是，领导者必须站在群众的前列。怎样办到这一点？到革命发生的地方去，到战斗着的群众中去，多到那儿去看看，你就能发现问题，并且找到解决问题的根据和途径。那样，领导者就立于主动地位，就能经常保持走在群众前面，带领群众不断地从一个顶峰进到另一个顶峰。
