    青年举重分区锦标赛合肥区比赛开始
    新华社合肥9日电　1960年全国青年举重分区锦标赛合肥竞赛区的比赛，8日开始在安徽省体育馆举行。
    在这天举行的最轻量级比赛中，安徽选手顾宗旭以二七七点五公斤（推八十、抓八十七点五、挺一一零）的总成绩取得冠军，这比3月下旬已经举行过比赛的西安、武汉竞赛区这项冠军的成绩都好。参加这个等级测验的江苏工人选手陶连禄，以二九五公斤（九十七点五、八十二点五、一一五）的总成绩达到运动健将标准。他在去年第一届全国运动会上曾经获得最轻量级第五名，当时总成绩只二百八十二点五公斤。
    8日的最轻量级比赛，共有十二名选手参加。他们在比赛中干劲十足，各有千秋。结果江苏的董化田以二六五公斤的总成绩获亚军。第三名到第六名的名次是：山东傅永生、福建纪重庆、福建骆美成和江苏庄汉生。
