Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Johannesburg News: Demonstrations have broken out in two more African townships in the Durban area of South Africa, protesting the South African Federal Government's "Pass Laws" and its bloody atrocities in suppressing Africans.

In Claremont, an African residential township fourteen miles from Durban, a large demonstration involving three thousand Africans broke out early on the 4th. Supported by the army and armored vehicles, the police used batons to beat the demonstrators, killing one African and injuring several others. In the Smith township, eight miles south of Durban, Africans also held a demonstration. In this township, the police detained many Africans. Africans in both townships refused to go to work.

The situation in Cato Manor, an African residential township near Durban, remains very tense. Military police in armored vehicles and transport trucks travel through the streets of Cato Manor all day long, and a reconnaissance plane circles overhead. At night, they use searchlights to illuminate every exit of the township.

In the African townships of the Durban area, large numbers of leaflets and pamphlets are circulating, calling on Africans to refuse to go to work. The South African Federal authorities hurriedly airlifted troops and police to the area on the evening of the 3rd to carry out suppression.

In Walmer, an African residential area near Port Elizabeth, about one hundred Africans burned the "passes" that restricted their movements on the evening of the 3rd. They danced around the bonfire to show their determination to fight. The police rushed to suppress them, and the African masses attacked the police vehicles with stones.

On the same day, in Bellville, thirty miles from Cape Town, Africans also burned a bag of "passes."

On the 4th, the South African authorities' police and army began the largest search of Africans in Cape Town since the recent bloody suppression in South Africa. The police threatened to disperse any gathering of African masses they saw, and to arrest anyone they considered to be an "agitator."

The "stay-at-home" strike by African residents in the two townships of Langa and Nyanga near Cape Town has lasted for two weeks, and the colonialist-run industry and commerce in Cape Town has already felt the impact of the strike. On the evening of the 2nd, the Governor-General of the South African Federation issued a new order prohibiting the South African people from organizing strikes, "stay-at-home" demonstrations, and slowdowns.

    反对种族歧视运动如燎原烈火
    南非人民继续展开斗争
    各地群众继续罢工示威抗议当局的镇压
    新华社4日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非德班地区又有两个非洲人市镇发生示威，抗议南非联邦政府的“通行证法”和它镇压非洲人的血腥暴行。
    距离德班十四英里的非洲居民市镇克拉尔蒙特，4日清早爆发了有三千名非洲人参加的大示威。警察在军队和装甲车的支援下用警棍殴打示威者，打死了一名非洲人，打伤了几人。在德班以南八英里的史密斯市镇，非洲人也举行了示威。在这个市镇里，警察拘禁了许多非洲人。这两个市镇的非洲人都拒绝上工。
    德班附近的非洲居民市镇卡托马诺尔的局势仍然十分紧张。乘坐装甲车和运输车的军警整日通过卡托马诺尔的街道，还有一架侦察机在上空盘旋。到了夜间，他们用探照灯照射这个市镇的各个出口。
    在德班地区的非洲人市镇里，流传着大量传单和小册子，号召非洲人拒绝上工。南非联邦当局在3日晚间慌忙用飞机把军队和警察空运到这个地区来进行镇压。
    在伊丽莎白港附近的非洲居民区瓦耳默，3日晚上约有一百名非洲人烧毁了束缚他们行动的“通行证”，他们围着这堆篝火跳舞表示他们斗争的决心。警察乘车赶往镇压，非洲群众用石块打击警察的车辆。
    同一天，在距离开普敦三十英里的巴尔城，也有非洲人烧毁了一口袋“通行证”。
    南非当局的警察和军队4日在开普敦开始了自从这次南非血腥镇压事件以来对非洲人所进行的最大的一次搜查。警察扬言要解散他们所看到的任何集结的非洲群众，并且还要逮捕他们所认为的“煽动者”。
    在开普敦附近的兰加和尼安加两个市镇的非洲居民所进行的“留在家里”的罢工已达两星期，在开普敦的殖民者经营的工商业已经感受到罢工的影响。南非联邦总督2日晚上颁布一个新的命令，禁止南非人民组织罢工、“留在家里”的示威和怠工。
