	Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Six hundred thousand people from all walks of life in the capital gathered in Tiananmen Square this afternoon to hold a massive rally in support of the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.
	Starting at twelve noon, people poured onto the streets in groups from every alley, waving flags and shouting slogans, forming a powerful demonstration procession. They expressed extreme anger at the U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique's bloody atrocities of slaughtering and suppressing patriotic South Korean people, expressed firm support for the South Korean people who are bravely fighting for democratic freedom and the right to survival, and also expressed great support for the Japanese people's massive struggle against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty.
	The people from all walks of life who participated in today's rally included workers, farmers, youth, students, street residents, and many well-organized militia battalions and militia companies. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the demonstrating masses had filled Tiananmen Square, converging into a sea of people.
	Lin Boqu, Peng Zhen, Li Fuchun, and He Long, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau, Hu Qiaomu, alternate member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premier of the State Council, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, He Xiangning, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Siguang and Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, participated in today's rally.
	Li Yonghao, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, and diplomatic officials of the embassy, the Korean trade union delegation headed by Kim Hee-joon, the Korean Central News Agency delegation headed by Ko Sung-chun, Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo, and Korean students and interns in Beijing, also participated in the rally.
	Party and state leaders, responsible persons of government departments, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing, as well as ambassadors and foreign guests from many countries, ascended the Tiananmen Gate.
	At three o'clock in the afternoon, Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, announced: The Capital's People from All Walks of Life Support the South Korean People's Patriotic and Just Struggle Rally begins.
	Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the CPC and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke first at the rally on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPC. He pointed out that the large-scale people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. He said that the South Korean traitorous ruling clique is now disintegrating, and the number one U.S. puppet, Syngman Rhee, has been forced to step down. The South Korean people's just struggle has achieved preliminary victory. The Chinese people congratulate the heroic South Korean people and pay them high tribute.
	Liu Ningyi strongly condemned the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism in South Korea. He pointed out that fifteen years of miserable life have made the South Korean people realize that U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique are the most ferocious enemies of the South Korean people. In this just struggle, despite the U.S. directing the Syngman Rhee clique to slaughter and suppress the South Korean people, making a desperate struggle, Syngman Rhee was still overthrown. This shows that the South Korean traitorous clique cannot maintain its reactionary rule even with the support of U.S. bayonets.
	Liu Ningyi mentioned that the appeal and suggestions recently issued by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the joint meeting of leaders of political parties and social organizations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out the correct path for the South Korean people's struggle and expressed the common aspirations of the entire Korean people. The Chinese people fully support these appeals and propositions. Liu Ningyi's words aroused earth-shattering applause and slogans from hundreds of thousands of people.
	Liu Ningyi then said that today, the feet of U.S. imperialism are everywhere volcanoes, which may erupt at any time, and the people of the world are opposing it. Imperialism and all reactionaries are bound to die, and the oppressed people are bound to win. We believe that with the support of the people of the world, as long as the South Korean people strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and continue to struggle, they will surely be able to completely overthrow the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee and his criminal clique, drive the U.S. aggressors out of South Korea, and realize the desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland.
	Liu Ningyi said that while the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique's fascist rule is surging forward, the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance has also set off a new upsurge. This is a new development in the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle. The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's struggle and believe that they will achieve even greater victories.
	Liu Ningyi's speech was constantly interrupted by applause and slogans from the square. People shouted: "Support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle!" "Support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland!" "Support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" "U.S. troops get out of South Korea, get out of Japan, get out of our territory Taiwan, get out of Asia!"
	The assembly warmly welcomed Li Yonghao, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, to speak.
	Ambassador Li Yonghao, after analyzing the current urgent and serious situation in South Korea, emphasized that in order to resolve the fragmented situation in South Korea as soon as possible, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party's letter to the South Korean people and the statement of the joint meeting of leaders of political parties and social organizations have suggested that a joint meeting of political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea be convened as soon as possible. In order to achieve this, the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops must be forced to withdraw from South Korea immediately.
	Ambassador Li Yonghao, in the name of the Korean people, sincerely thanked the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people for their active support and concern for the South Korean people's struggle. He said that with the internationalist support and solidarity of the fraternal Chinese people, the Korean people will surely achieve victory in their sacred struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggressors to get out of South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
	The enthusiastic slogans of the entire crowd repeatedly interrupted Ambassador Li Yonghao's speech. People shouted: "Oppose U.S. interference in Korean internal affairs!" "Oppose the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique's massacre of patriotic South Korean people!" "Punish the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique!" "U.S. troops get out of South Korea!"
	Next to speak at the rally were responsible persons of various people's organizations and democratic parties, as well as workers, farmers, street residents, scientists, students, etc. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle on behalf of the people from all walks of life.
	Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said that in the demonstration armies in various cities of South Korea, there are tens of thousands of women and children participating, which shows the South Korean people's unwavering will to overthrow the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee and expel the U.S. aggressors. Cai Chang said that at the same time, we see that in order to resolutely demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, seven million Japanese people have held an unprecedentedly large-scale demonstration. The spearhead of the South Korean people and the Japanese people's struggle is not only directed at the reactionary government of Syngman Rhee and the reactionary government of Nobusuke Kishi, but is directly aimed at the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism. Because it is U.S. imperialism that occupies the land of South Korea and Japan, ravages the South Korean and Japanese people, and threatens peace in the Far East and the world. We Chinese women and the Chinese people firmly support the heroic and just struggle of the Korean and Japanese people.
	Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, said that in the great patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, the South Korean youth and students are a heroic and resolute force. They have made great contributions to the cause of liberation of the South Korean people. We believe that the South Korean people and youth will unyieldingly carry this struggle through to the end, and they will surely achieve final victory. Hu Yaobang said that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Asian people. There can be no true freedom and liberation without driving out U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism, which runs rampant in the world and does all kinds of bad things, will not live long. The Chinese youth must unite closely with the youth of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and with the youth of the world, and resolutely fight to overthrow imperialism and realize lasting peace for mankind.
	Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said that the bare-handed South Korean students and all the people are united and launching a heroic struggle against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandits who are armed to the teeth. The South Korean youth and students are doing a good job! The Chinese students resolutely and fully support their struggle. The united struggle of the South Korean people once again proves that it is the awakened masses of the people who determine the course of history. The power of the people is a thousand times, ten thousand times greater than the power of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and they will eventually be burned to ashes in the flames of the people's revolution.
	He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in her speech that the flames of the South Korean people's struggle cannot be extinguished. We six hundred and fifty million Chinese people vow to fully support the just struggle of the Korean people. With the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the Korean people's struggle will surely win the final victory. At present, the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty and the revival of Japanese militarism is unfolding fiercely on an unprecedentedly large scale. Everyone knows that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people of South Korea, the people of Japan, and the people of Asian countries. U.S. imperialism must get out of South Korea, Japan, and Asia.
	Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: The South Korean people's struggle against the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee has erupted like a volcano. The South Korean people's struggle is part of the current struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for liberation and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and enslavement. All peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world sympathize with and support the South Korean people. At present, the flames of the Asian people's struggle against U.S. imperialist war and aggression policies are burning more and more fiercely. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is surging higher than the last. We fully believe that the flames of the Korean people and the Japanese people's struggle will burn more and more vigorously, and the people's fighting spirit will become stronger and stronger. Shen Junru finally raised his hand and shouted: The final victory must belong to the Korean people and the Japanese people!
	Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech that the heroic actions of the South Korean people and the revolutionary spirit that has become stronger and stronger in the past half month have won the sympathy and support of the people all over the world. While the South Korean people are carrying out a patriotic and just struggle, the Japanese people are carrying out a heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty, and the people of Indochina are struggling against U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Geneva Conference agreements and creation of tense situations. We believe that these just struggles of the people of Asian countries will converge into a torrent that will eventually completely destroy U.S. imperialism's colonial rule in Asia.
	Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The South Korean people's powerful patriotic and just struggle against the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee, and the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against the revival of Japanese militarism, have formed two huge torrents, giving U.S. imperialism a heavy blow. We Chinese people and the Korean people have always been closely linked. The enemies of the Korean people and the Japanese people are our enemies. We industrialists and businesspeople, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the patriotic and just struggles of the Korean and Japanese people.
	Liu Guangjin, a worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, said, We Chinese workers firmly support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. The victory of this struggle is not only the wish of the South Korean people, but also the wish of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people all over the world. The power of our people is great and invincible. U.S. imperialism must collapse, and the people must win.
	Yin Weichen, Director of the Huangtugang Sino-Hungarian Friendship People's Commune, said that U.S. imperialism is not only massacring the Korean people, but also colluding with the South Vietnamese reactionaries to suppress the people, colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, supporting Japanese militarism, and also occupying our territory Taiwan, everywhere being hostile to the people. All anti-imperialist people in Asia unite and drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea, out of Japan, out of South Vietnam, and out of our territory Taiwan.
	Tang Shuzhen, a member of the Jianguomen People's Commune, representing all the members of the urban street people's communes in Beijing, said: The South Korean people's struggle is just, and victory must belong to the Korean people. She said that we must accelerate our socialist construction and support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle with practical actions.
	Huang Jiasi, President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said: Chinese educators, scientists, and the people of the whole country resolutely support the South Korean people's just struggle against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, support the Korean people's just struggle to reunify their motherland, and support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for Japan's independent democracy, peace, and neutrality.
	Cui Yumei, a student at Peking University, said that only by driving U.S. imperialism out of South Korea can the South Korean people be liberated from disaster and achieve peace and reunification in Korea. We must stand firmly with the Korean people and fully support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. Victory must belong to the South Korean people.
	Their speeches constantly aroused enthusiastic applause and impassioned slogans.
	Finally, the assembly read out the circular telegram. At this time, the square boiled again, and slogans and applause continued for a long time.
	The responsible persons of various democratic parties who participated in today's meeting included Cai Tingkai and Xiong Kewu, Vice Chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Hu Yuzhi, Deng Chumin, and Wu Han, Vice Chairmen of the China Democratic League, Shi Fuliang and Hu Ziang, Vice Chairmen of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Wang Shaoao and Yang Dongchun, Vice Chairmen of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Central Committee, Chen Qiyou, Chairman

    六十万人在天安门前大集会　群情鼎沸谴责美李集团法西斯统治
    首都人民大示威支援南朝鲜人民正义斗争
    坚决支持日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约，相信他们一定取得更大胜利
    刘宁一、李永镐大使、各界代表讲话一致高呼美军从南朝鲜、日本和台湾等地滚出去！
    新华社28日讯　首都各界人民六十万人，今天下午聚集在天安门广场，举行了声势浩大的支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会。
    从中午十二时开始，人们从大街小巷成群结队地涌上街头，他们挥舞着旗帜，高呼着口号，形成了强大的示威游行行列。他们对美帝国主义和李承晚集团屠杀和镇压爱国的南朝鲜人民的血腥暴行表示极大的愤怒，对正在为争取民主自由和生存权利而英勇斗争的南朝鲜人民表示坚决支援，他们还对日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约的声势浩大的斗争，表示极大的支持。
    参加今天集会的各界人民，包括工人、农民、青年学生、街道居民和许多队伍严整的民兵营、民兵连。到下午二时，示威的群众已经站满了天安门广场，汇合成一片人海。
    中国共产党中央政治局委员林伯渠、彭真、李富春、贺龙，中央政治局候补委员康生，中央书记处候补书记胡乔木，国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、何香凝、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，全国妇联主席蔡畅，共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦，参加了今天的大会。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐和大使馆的外交官员，正在北京的以金熙俊为首的朝鲜工会代表团，以高成淳为首的朝鲜中央通讯社代表团，朝鲜和平人士黄凤九等，以及在北京的朝鲜留学生和实习生等，也都参加了大会。
    党和国家的领导人，政府各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人，北京市的负责人，以及许多国家的驻华使节和外宾登上了天安门城楼。
    下午三时，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁宣布：首都各界人民支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会开始。
    中共中央委员、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，代表中共中央首先在大会上讲话。他指出，南朝鲜爆发的大规模的反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的人民斗争，是对美帝国主义的沉重打击。他说，现在南朝鲜卖国统治集团内部已经分崩离析，美国第一号傀儡李承晚已经被迫宣布下台，南朝鲜人民的正义斗争已经取得了初步胜利。中国人民为此向英勇斗争的南朝鲜人民表示祝贺，并致以崇高的敬意。
    刘宁一强烈地谴责了美帝国主义对南朝鲜的殖民统治。他指出，十五年的惨痛生活，使南朝鲜人民认清了美帝国主义和李承晚卖国集团是南朝鲜人民的最凶恶的敌人。在这次正义斗争中，尽管美国指使李承晚集团屠杀和镇压南朝鲜人民，进行疯狂的挣扎，李承晚还是被赶下了台。这说明南朝鲜的卖国集团即使依靠美国的刺刀也不能照样维持它的反动统治。
    刘宁一提到，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、社会团体领袖联席会议最近发出的号召和建议，指出了南朝鲜人民斗争的正确道路，表达了全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望，中国人民完全支持这些号召和主张。刘宁一的这些话，激起了数十万人震天动地的掌声和口号声。
    刘宁一接着说，今天，美帝国主义的脚下到处是火山，随时可能爆发，全世界人民都在反对它。帝国主义和一切反动派必然要死亡，被压迫的人民一定要胜利。我们相信，南朝鲜人民在全世界人民的支持下，只要加强团结，提高警惕，继续斗争下去，就一定能够把李承晚及其罪恶集团的法西斯统治彻底打倒，把美国侵略者赶出南朝鲜，实现祖国和平统一的愿望。
    刘宁一说，在南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的爱国正义斗争汹涌发展的同时，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争也掀起了新的高潮，这是日本人民反美斗争的一个新发展。中国人民坚决支持日本人民的斗争，并且相信他们一定会取得更大的胜利。
    刘宁一的讲话，不断被广场上的掌声和口号声所打断。人们高呼：“支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争！”“支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争！”“支持日本人民反对日美安全条约的斗争！”“美国军队从南朝鲜滚出去，从日本滚出去，从我国领土台湾滚出去，从亚洲滚出去！”
    大会热烈欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐讲话。
    李　永　镐大使在分析了南朝鲜当前刻不容缓的严重局势之后强调指出，为了早日解决南朝鲜支离破碎的局面，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会告南朝鲜人民书和各政党、社会团体领袖联席会议声明，已建议尽速召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体联席会议。为了实现这一点，必须迫使美帝国主义侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    李永镐大使以朝鲜人民的名义，衷心感谢北京市人民和全体中国人民给予南朝鲜人民斗争的积极支持和关切。他说，受到兄弟般的中国人民国际主义的支持和声援的朝鲜人民，在迫使美帝国主义侵略者滚出南朝鲜，争取自己祖国和平统一的神圣斗争中，一定会获得胜利。
    全场群众激昂的口号声，一再打断李永镐大使的讲话。人们高呼：“反对美国干涉朝鲜内政！”“反对美李集团屠杀南朝鲜爱国人民！”“惩办李承晚卖国集团！”“美国军队从南朝鲜滚出去！”
    接着在大会上讲话的，有各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人和工人、农民、街道居民、科学家、学生等。他们分别代表各界人民，一致表示坚决支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅说，在南朝鲜各个城市的示威大军中，有着成千成万的妇女和儿童参加，这一事实说明了南朝鲜人民推翻李承晚的反动统治，驱逐美国侵略者不可动摇的意志。蔡畅说，在同一个时候，我们看到日本人民为了坚决要求废除日美军事同盟条约，有七百万人举行了空前未有的大规模的示威游行。南朝鲜人民和日本人民斗争的矛头，不但是指向李承晚反动政府和岸信介反动政府，而且是直接指向全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义。因为正是美帝国主义霸占着南朝鲜和日本的土地，蹂躏着南朝鲜和日本人民，威胁着远东和世界和平。我们中国妇女和中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和日本人民的英勇、正义的斗争。
    中国共产主义青年团中央第一书记胡耀邦说，在南朝鲜人民伟大的爱国斗争中，南朝鲜青年和学生是一支英勇坚决的力量。他们为南朝鲜人民的解放事业作出了巨大的贡献。我们相信南朝鲜人民和青年不屈不挠地把这个斗争进行到底，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。胡耀邦说，美帝国主义是亚洲人民的死敌。不赶走美帝国主义，就不可能有真正的自由解放。在世界上横行霸道、尽干坏事的美帝国主义，寿命不会很长了。中国青年一定同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的青年，同全世界的青年，紧密地团结起来，坚决斗争，打倒帝国主义，实现人类的持久和平。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立说，赤手空拳的南朝鲜学生和全体人民一起，万众一心，向武装到牙齿的美李匪帮展开英勇的搏斗。南朝鲜青年学生干得好！中国学生坚决地、全力地支持他们的斗争。南朝鲜人民团结一致的斗争再一次证明了，决定历史进程的是觉醒了的人民群众。人民的力量比原子弹、氢弹的力量要大一千倍、一万倍。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，它们最终都将在人民革命的烈火中烧成灰烬。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席　何香凝在讲话中说，南朝鲜人民斗争的火焰是扑不灭的。我们六万万五千万中国人民誓以全力支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。在全世界人民的同情和声援下，朝鲜人民的斗争必将获得最后的胜利。目前，日本人民反对日美军事条约和日本军国主义复活的斗争正以空前巨大的规模猛烈展开。谁都知道，美帝国主义是南朝鲜人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民的死敌，美帝国主义必须从南朝鲜、日本和亚洲滚出去。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒说：南朝鲜人民反对美李反动统治的斗争像火山一样爆发了。南朝鲜人民的斗争，是当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取解放、反对美帝国主义侵略奴役的斗争的一部分。全世界爱好和平、主张正义的人民都同情和支持南朝鲜人民。目前，亚洲人民反对美帝国主义战争侵略政策的斗争火焰正在日益猛烈地燃烧。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争一浪高过一浪。我们完全相信，朝鲜人民和日本人民的斗争怒火将愈烧愈旺，人民的斗志将愈战愈强。沈钧儒最后举手高呼：最后的胜利必定属于朝鲜人民和日本人民！
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培在他的讲话中说，南朝鲜人民的英勇行为和半个多月来愈战愈强的革命精神，已得到全世界人民的同情和支持。在南朝鲜人民进行爱国正义斗争的同时，日本人民正在为反对日美军事条约而进行英勇的斗争，印度支那各国人民正在为反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦会议协议制造紧张局势而进行斗争。我们相信，亚洲各国人民的这些正义斗争，汇成一股洪流，终将彻底冲毁美帝国主义在亚洲的殖民统治。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说：南朝鲜人民声势浩大的反对美李反动统治的爱国正义斗争，同日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，反对日本军国主义复活的斗争形成了两股巨流，给了美帝国主义以沉重打击。我们中国人民和朝鲜人民从来都是血肉相联的。朝鲜人民和日本人民的敌人就是我们的敌人。我们工商业者和全国人民一起，坚决支持朝鲜人民和日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    石景山发电厂工人刘光金说，我们中国工人坚决支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。这个斗争的胜利，不仅是南朝鲜人民的愿望，也是中国人民和爱好和平的全世界人民的愿望。我们人民的力量是伟大的，是不可战胜的，美帝国主义一定要垮台，人民一定要胜利。
    黄土岗中匈友好人民公社主任殷维臣说，美帝国主义不但在屠杀朝鲜人民，还勾结南越反动派镇压人民，勾结日本反动派订立美日军事同盟条约，扶植日本军国主义，还霸占着我国的领土台湾，到处与人民为敌。亚洲一切反帝国主义的人民联合起来，把美帝国主义从南朝鲜赶出去，从日本赶出去，从南越赶出去，从我国的领土台湾赶出去。
    建国门人民公社社员　唐淑贞代表北京市城市街道人民公社的全体社员说：南朝鲜人民的斗争是正义的，胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。她表示，一定要加速我国社会主义建设事业，用实际行动支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    中国医学科学院院长黄家驷说：中国的教育工作者、科学工作者和全国人民一道，坚决支援南朝鲜人民的反对美李反动集团的正义斗争，支援朝鲜人民的统一祖国的正义斗争，支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和争取日本独立民主、和平中立的斗争。
    北京大学学生崔玉梅说，只有把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民才能从灾难中解放出来，实现朝鲜的和平和统一。我们一定和朝鲜人民紧紧地站在一起，全力支援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，胜利一定属于南朝鲜人民。
    他们的讲话不断激起热烈的掌声和激昂的口号声。
    最后，大会宣读了通电。这时，广场上再一次地沸腾起来，口号声和鼓掌声经久不息。
    参加今天大会的各民主党派的负责人，有中国国民党革命委员会副主席蔡廷锴、熊克武，中国民主同盟副主席胡愈之、邓初民、吴晗，中国民主建国会副主任委员施复亮、胡子昂，中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊、杨东莼，中国农工民主党中央主席团主席季方，中国致公党主席陈其尤，台湾民主自治同盟秘书长徐萌山和九三学社的负责人。
