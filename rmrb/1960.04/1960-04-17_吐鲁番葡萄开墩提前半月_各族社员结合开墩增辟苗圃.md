    Turpan Grapes Uncovered Half a Month Early
    People of All Nationalities Combine Uncovering with Expanding Nurseries
    (Reported by this newspaper) Members of all nationalities in the Turpan Basin, Xinjiang, have launched an intense grape uncovering effort in the grape uncovering season.
    This year, the area of fruit-bearing grapes in Turpan County has increased by 2,500 mu compared to last year, of which 2,000 mu are distributed in the Turpan County Horticultural Farm, which is close to the Lanxin Railway. In order to achieve high grape yields and strive to double the total output, the key grape production areas—the Grape Gully Management District of the Grape Commune and the Wuxing Brigade and Communist Youth League Brigade of the Wuxing Commune—have applied an average of 8,000 to 10,000 jin of high-quality base fertilizer per mu of grape land from last year to the present.
    During the uncovering process, key grape production areas generally organized communist large-scale collaborations of varying scopes, concentrating large numbers of people to carry out crash programs. During the peak uncovering period, all members of the Grape Gully Management District, except for those involved in water conservancy construction and responsible for living welfare, participated in the grape uncovering work. The Second Management District of the Wuxing Commune also organized more than 200 strong laborers from various brigades to help the Wuxing Brigade with uncovering. Due to early action and the organization of large-scale collaboration, the completion of this year's uncovering is expected to be half a month earlier than last year.
    While uncovering the grapes, members of all nationalities also paid attention to the cultivation of grape seedlings and specially expanded the grape nurseries by about 500 mu, preparing to expand the grape area after autumn and support various places within the pass (i.e., the interior of China).

    吐鲁番葡萄开墩提前半月
    各族社员结合开墩增辟苗圃
    本报讯　新疆吐鲁番盆地的各族社员，在葡萄开墩的季节里，展开了紧张的开墩工作。
    今年，吐鲁番县的结果葡萄的面积比去年增加了二千五百亩，其中有二千亩分布在紧靠兰新铁路的吐鲁番县园艺场。为了葡萄高产，力争实现总产翻一番的指标，重点葡萄产地——葡萄公社的葡萄沟管理区和五星公社的五星大队、共青团大队，从去年到现在先后给每亩葡萄地平均上了八千斤到一万斤优质底肥。
    在开墩中，各重点葡萄产地普遍组织了不同范围的共产主义大协作，集中了大批人力进行突击。在开墩紧张时期，葡萄沟管理区除了兴修水利和负责生活福利的社员以外，全部参加了葡萄开墩工作。五星公社第二管理区，还从各大队组织了二百多个强壮劳动力帮助五星大队开墩。由于动手早和组织大协作，今年开墩结束期可比去年早半个月。
    各族社员在葡萄开墩的同时，还注意了葡萄幼苗的培育，专门增辟了五百亩左右的葡萄苗圃，准备在秋后扩大葡萄面积，和支援关内各地。
