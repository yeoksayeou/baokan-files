Must “Favor One Side”, Be “One-Sided”
Mao Tieqiao, Deputy Director of the Guizhou Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Discusses the Self-Reform of Industrialists and Businessmen

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I am determined to work hard for their implementation.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Guizhou's economic and cultural construction in 1959 achieved another great leap forward victory on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the province are following the road pointed out by the Party's General Line for socialist construction, full of confidence and courage, and advancing valiantly to seize an even greater leap forward this year. A vigorous mass production and construction upsurge centered on technological innovation and technological revolution has already formed. A new socialist Guizhou is being accelerated.

Now I will report to the conference on the service and transformation of industrialists and businessmen in Guizhou Province.

Industrialists and Businessmen Have Made Great Achievements in Service and Great Progress in Transformation

Over the past year or so, Guizhou's industrial and commercial circles have made great achievements in serving socialist construction and carrying out political and ideological self-reform. First of all, under the leadership of the Party and with the impetus of the working people, the vast majority of people have participated in various forms of physical labor, which is a great change. In larger cities, the physical labor participated in by industrialists and businessmen mainly involves going down to workshops, working at counters, or working as apprentices. In 1959, 43 private individuals serving as factory directors and managers in Guiyang City regularly went down to workshops and counters, accounting for 27% of the private individuals holding this level of position. As for working as apprentices or participating in short-distance transportation, loading and unloading, and other voluntary labor in enterprises, private individuals generally participated to the best of their ability. In county towns and market towns, industrialists and businessmen mainly participated in various voluntary labor activities to support industrial and agricultural production, focusing on the central tasks of each period. In Guiding County's Chengguan Town, 905 industrialists and businessmen contributed 17,450 workdays in 1959. In addition, many county towns and market towns have also established farms and livestock farms as bases for industrialists and businessmen to engage in labor training. Anlong County has been rotating industrialists and businessmen to work on livestock farms every two months since September 1959, with four groups totaling 100 people having been dispatched so far. At the same time, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have participated in the production increase and economy campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution under the direct leadership of the Party organizations in their enterprises, contributing their own strength. In industry, many people have put forward many rationalization proposals for improving operating methods, improving product quality, saving raw materials, and improving business management; some have made contributions in imitating and improving tools, and some have made creations; some have been rewarded for making significant achievements, and some have been invited to attend local or national "hero gatherings." In Guiyang City's industrial enterprises, a total of 138 private individuals were rated as quarterly advanced producers and advanced workers in 1959, accounting for 37% of the total number of private individuals in industrial enterprises. In commerce, most people have made great achievements in improving business management, accelerating capital turnover, saving expenses, improving warehousing and storage, and improving merchandise displays. Most industrialists and businessmen in the catering service industry have improved their service attitude and service quality; many have also created and innovated some tools in the movement to change manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized operation, saving labor and improving work efficiency. Therefore, many people have been rewarded. In Guiding County's Chengguan Town, 192 industrialists and businessmen were rated as quarterly advanced workers in 1959, accounting for 27% of the total number of industrialists and businessmen in the commercial and catering service industries. Private individuals in the public-private joint venture restaurants and hotels in Yongning Town, Zhenning County, under the leadership and education of the Party, basically took customers into consideration, such as diligently helping sick passengers, carrying disabled soldiers up and down buses, taking care of pregnant women, delivering meals to drivers whose cars had broken down, giving up their own quilts to accommodate passengers arriving late at night, and trying to ensure that passengers ate and slept well, and were therefore repeatedly praised by passengers. At present, driven by the large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movement and under the call to support spring plowing production, the enthusiasm of most industrialists and businessmen in the province to serve socialism has increased to a certain extent, and the number of people making better achievements is gradually increasing.

In terms of political ideology, the changes over the past year or so have also been relatively significant. In terms of accepting the leadership of the Party, with the rapid development of socialist construction since the Great Leap Forward, most people have felt more and more deeply that "there would be no New China without the Communist Party"; many people feel that their past small and simple enterprises, after the transformation of joint ventures, especially the development in the past two years, are vastly different from the past; many people have experienced and been deeply moved by the fact that after putting themselves into practice, on the one hand, they have clearly seen that the Party's leadership over production and technology is so professional and outstanding; on the other hand, they have gradually understood that they must seriously accept the leadership of the Party, so that they will have reliance, direction, and methods, and without the leadership of the Party, there can be no way out. We have learned in practice that as long as we have a little ability, the Party will give us full opportunities to play our role; when the road is not right in practice, and there are doubts and hesitations, the Party will point out the direction for us, patiently persuade and educate us, and patiently wait; when we have mistakes and shortcomings, the Party will give us strict guidance and sincere help; when we have a little progress and achievement, the Party will give us timely praise and encouragement. Therefore, many people have a feeling of gratitude to the Party that "the Party's kindness cannot be expressed enough," and continue to lean towards the Party and the workers, and the attitude of being cautious and vigilant has gradually decreased; in work, they are more able to respond to the Party's call, obey the allocation, ask the Party for instructions and reports, and complete the tasks assigned by the Party. All this shows that the progress of industrialists and businessmen in accepting the leadership of the Party is very significant. In terms of taking the socialist road, over the past year or so, we have personally seen that it is precisely because of the General Line that the power of the Chinese people has exploded like atomic energy, creating great miracles with the force of overwhelming mountains and seas; it is precisely because of the Great Leap Forward that our country's industrial and agricultural production has achieved high-speed development and achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in a short period of time; it is precisely because of the People's Communes that we have overcome natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production. In the common labor with the working people, we have personally seen the working people's strong desire to build socialism and the constantly rising revolutionary enthusiasm, coupled with the education of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which has made us gradually have new feelings and understanding of the greatness and correctness of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, of the superiority of socialism and capitalism, and of where to go between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. At the same time, because we have done a little bit of work in the Great Leap Forward, we feel that we also have a share in the great cause of socialist construction, and the desire to take the socialist road has been strengthened compared to the past. Many people are more concerned about the work of the enterprise, and their ideological feelings for socialism have begun to change. In terms of relations with the working people, in the past, it was thought that the working people had nothing to learn, especially the dissatisfaction with learning from the workers in their own enterprises; after working together with the working people, they have a further understanding of the working people's soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, selfless labor enthusiasm, disregard for personal gains and losses, and selfless and noble qualities, as well as the infinite wisdom of the working people, and gradually changed their views and attitudes towards the working people; they gradually understood that they must rely on the masses in everything and learn from the working people; due to the change in thoughts and actions, the distance with the working people is gradually shortening. From the perspective of the families of industrialists and businessmen, over the past year or so, with the development of the People's Commune movement and social life and welfare undertakings, while doing a good job in housework, many people have begun to participate in labor training, such as delivering fertilizer, fighting drought, and planting trees. Some participated in public canteens, nurseries and other social welfare undertakings; participated in street work and production labor in enterprises run by the streets. Some people have been rewarded and praised for their outstanding achievements.

Over the past year or so, the reason why our industrialists and businessmen and their families have been able to make achievements in service and progress in transformation is first of all the correct leadership and continuous education and help of the Party, and at the same time, it is also driven by the excellent situation of the Great Leap Forward and the motivation and help of the working people. This is a great victory of the Party's General Line in the cause of socialist transformation, and a great victory of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie.

Although our industrial and commercial circles have made great achievements and progress in service and transformation, generally speaking, the capitalist side has decreased and the socialist side has increased, but it has not progressed to the point where the majority of people have solved or basically solved their political positions. The general situation is that there is great progress, but specifically for each of us, the progress is different. If we measure it by the six political criteria, it is still far from enough, and we must continue to transform ourselves. For example, many people still have doubts and vigilance about accepting the leadership of the Party to varying degrees; there are still varying degrees of doubts, hesitations, and even dissatisfaction and resistance to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

Industrialists and Businessmen Should Listen to Chairman Mao Wholeheartedly and Follow the Party Wholeheartedly

Because industrialists and businessmen have bourgeois individualism, some people do work mostly from the perspective of personal gains and losses, their enthusiasm is insufficient, their enthusiasm is not high, and they are afraid of tension and difficulty. In addition, phenomena such as harming the public for personal gain, embezzlement, and misappropriation of public funds still occur from time to time. In terms of relations with the working people, many people still have not solved the problem of learning from the working people. Some people became complacent and cocky after making a little achievement in service, saying that they were "almost" the same as the workers. In terms of labor and learning, many people still hold a perfunctory attitude towards participating in labor, they are willing to do light work, but not heavy work, they do more in front of people, less behind people, they can do it for a short time, but not for a long time, and some are disgusted and resistant. There are also many people who have ideological emotions of replacing transformation with service, and are unwilling to participate in learning. All this shows that the duality of industrial and commercial circles still exists and must continue to be transformed.

Our country has entered a new historical period of continuous leap forward in production, continuous revolution in thought, complete elimination of capitalism, and high-speed construction of socialism. In order to adapt to the rapidly developing requirements of the objective situation, and in order to keep up with the leaping pace of the working people, our industrial and commercial circles must continue to progress on the existing basis, further transform our political positions, and gradually establish a proletarian worldview, gradually become one with the workers and peasants, and gradually transform ourselves from exploiters into laborers. In this great decade of the 1960s, we will use the spirit of continuous revolution to push the socialist transformation of our industrialists and businessmen to a new milestone. During the recent meeting of members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Party Central Committee gave us extremely cordial and extremely important instructions and teachings. In order to enable us to accept socialist transformation, the Party has given us meticulous care and consideration. The Party and Chairman Mao love us like parents and educate us like teachers, so that we can constantly improve our understanding, increase our confidence, break with capitalism and establish socialism, and continue to move forward. We must truly "favor one side" and be "one-sided," wholeheartedly considering the interests of the country and the people, and resolutely lean towards socialism. Experience tells us that those who consider the overall situation and do good deeds for socialism will be rewarded by the Party and the people, while those who look for loopholes and only consider personal interests always achieve the opposite result.

In order to be able to better serve socialism and better carry out self-reform in the future, and to "favor one side" and be "one-sided," from my personal life experience of more than ten years, I deeply feel that the most fundamental thing is to listen to Chairman Mao wholeheartedly and follow the Party wholeheartedly. In the early days of joint ventures, because I was alienated from and resisted the Party, I was ideologically awkward and mentally depressed, and even planned to leave the enterprise, get rid of the leadership of the Party, and take the old road of capitalism. If the Party had not educated and helped me in time and saved me, I would have inevitably made a big mistake. The practice in recent years has made me further realize that as long as I truly lean towards the Party and accept the leadership of the Party, I will have a clear direction, an open mind, and a happy mood. I will have confidence and determination in accepting transformation, I will make rapid progress, and I will have great enthusiasm; otherwise, I will lose my direction, the future will be bleak, capitalist things will raise their heads, my mood will be depressed, I will be tired and resistant to transformation, and I will be lazy and unenthusiastic about work, and the consequences will be unimaginable. In short, if we want to contribute our own strength to the great cause of socialist construction, do something good for the country and the people, and smoothly go through the process of transforming from exploiters into laborers, the only way is to earnestly listen to Chairman Mao, lean towards the Party wholeheartedly, accept transformation wholeheartedly, and serve socialism wholeheartedly.

Taking Labor Practice as the Foundation and Continuously Carrying Out Self-Reform is a Basic Experience

The practice of recent years has proved that to serve well and transform well, we must closely combine service and transformation. Actively participate in labor practice, and in the process of labor practice, continuously carry out self-reform, and truly make political ideology the commander, labor practice the foundation, and closely combine the two and promote each other. This is a basic experience for our industrial and commercial circles to carry out self-reform. We should accept past experience, continue to move forward, continue to transform ourselves, on the one hand, actively participate in labor practice and serve socialism wholeheartedly; on the other hand, actively participate in political study, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works. In the process of practice and study, gradually change our political positions, gradually establish a proletarian worldview, and make ourselves a glorious laborer who supports ourselves.

After this conference, we will definitely resolutely implement the spirit of the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, wholeheartedly, under the leadership of the Party, improve our awareness, boost our energy, actively participate in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, better do our job, better carry out self-reform, and make more and greater contributions to the socialist construction cause of our great motherland.

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success!

    必须“顾一头”、“一边倒”
    贵州省工商业联合会副主任毛铁桥谈工商业者自我改造问题主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护陈叔通副主席、李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告，并坚决为其贯彻执行而努力。
    我们贵州在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，1959年的经济文化建设在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。现在，全省各族人民正沿着党的社会主义建设总路线所指引的道路，满怀着信心和勇气，以豪迈的步伐，为夺取今年的更大跃进而奋勇前进。一个蓬勃发展的以技术革新技术革命为中心的群众性的生产建设高潮已经形成。社会主义的新贵州，正在加速建设中。
    现在我把贵州省工商业者服务和改造的情况向大会作一汇报。
    工商业者在服务中做出很大成绩，在改造中取得很大进步
    一年多来，贵州工商界在为社会主义建设服务和进行政治思想的自我改造方面，取得了很大的成绩。首先，在党的领导下，在劳动人民的带动下，绝大多数人参加了各种形式的体力劳动，这是一个很大的变化。在较大城市里，工商业者参加的体力劳动，主要是下车间、上柜台，或跟班劳动。1959年，贵阳市担任厂长、经理的私方人员定期下放车间、柜台的就有四十三人，占担任这一级职务的私方人员的27％。至于跟班劳动或在企业里参加短途运输、装卸货物以及其他义务劳动，在力所能及的原则下，私方人员一般也都参加了。在县城和集镇，工商业者主要是围绕着各个时期的中心任务，经常参加支援工农业生产等各种义务劳动。贵定县城关镇九百零五个工商业者，1959年即出工一万七千四百五十人次。此外，许多县城和集镇，还建立了农场、畜牧场，作为工商业者劳动锻炼的基地。安龙县从1959年9月起，两月一期，轮放工商业者到畜牧场劳动，至目前已下放了四批，共一百人。与此同时，绝大多数工商业者都在企业党组织的直接领导下，参加了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，贡献自己的力量。在工业方面，很多人在改进操作方法、提高产品质量、节约原材料和改善经营管理等方面，提出了不少合理化建议；有的人在仿制和改良工具方面作出了贡献，并有若干创造；有一部分人由于作出了显著成绩而受到奖励，其中有的还被邀光荣地出席了当地的或者全国的“群英会”。贵阳市工业企业中的私方人员，在1959年内曾被评为季度先进生产者和先进工作者的共有一百三十八人，占工业企业私方人员总数的37％。在商业方面，多数人在改善经营管理、加速资金周转、节约费用、改进仓储保管、搞好商品陈列等方面都做出了很大成绩。饮食服务行业中的工商业者，多数人改善了服务态度，提高了服务质量；不少人在改手工操作为机械化、半机械化的运动中，还创制和革新了一些用具，节约了劳动力，提高了工作效率。因此，不少人受到了奖励。贵定县城关镇的工商业者在1959年曾被评为季度先进工作者的有一百九十二人，占商业、饮食服务业工商业者总人数的27％。镇宁县永宁镇公私合营餐旅店中的私方人员，在党的领导和教育下，基本上作到为顾客着想，如殷勤扶持患病旅客，背残废军人上下汽车，照料孕妇，为汽车抛锚的驾驶员送饭，让出自己的被子接待深夜到达的旅客，设法使旅客吃好、睡好等等，因而受到了旅客的多次表扬。目前，全省工商业者在大规模的技术革新和技术革命运动的推动下，在支援春耕生产的号召下，多数人为社会主义服务的积极性有了一定的提高，作出较好成绩的人有逐渐增多的趋势。在政治思想方面，一年多来，变化也是比较显著的。在接受党的领导方面，随着大跃进以来社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的发展，多数人对于“没有共产党就没有新中国”越来感受越深；不少人对自己过去经营的狭小简陋的企业，经过合营后的改造，尤其是近两年来的发展，新旧对比，感到真是判若天壤；很多人体验得特别亲切而且受到很大感动的，是在投入实践以后，一方面清楚地看到了党对生产对技术的领导是那样的内行，那样的出色；另一方面也逐渐懂得了一定要认真接受党的领导，就会有依靠，有方向，有办法，而离开了党的领导，就不可能有任何的出路。我们在实践中体会到，只要我们有一点能力，党就给予充分发挥的机会；在实践中路走得不对，有动摇和顾虑，党就给我们指出方向，不厌其烦地进行说服教育，并且耐心地等待；我们有了错误和缺点，党就给予严正的教导和恳切的帮助；我们有了点滴的进步和成绩，党就及时的表扬和鼓励。因此，很多人对党产生一种“党的恩情说不尽，道不完”的感激心情，从而继续向党和工人靠拢，唯唯诺诺、戒备心情逐渐减少了；在工作上比较能够响应党的号召，服从分配，向党请示汇报，完成党交给的任务。所有这些，说明工商业者在接受党的领导上进步是很大的。在走社会主义道路方面，一年多来，我们亲眼看到了正是有了总路线，才使中国人民的力量像原子能一样的爆发出来，以排山倒海之势，创造出伟大的奇迹；正是有了大跃进，才使我们国家的工农业生产获得了高速度的发展，在短短的时期内取得史无前例的辉煌成就；正是有了人民公社，才使我们战胜了自然灾害，获得农业生产的大丰收。在和劳动人民的共同劳动中，亲眼看到了劳动人民建设社会主义的强烈愿望和不断高涨的革命热情，再加上受到了党的八届八中全会精神教育，使我们对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大和正确，对于社会主义和资本主义的谁优谁劣，对于资本主义和社会主义的两条道路之间何去何从，逐渐有了新的感受和认识。同时由于在大跃进中或多或少地尽了一些力量，感到了在社会主义建设的伟大事业中，也有自己的一份，走社会主义道路的愿望较前增强了，许多人对企业工作比较关心了，对社会主义的思想感情也就开始起了一些变化。在同劳动人民的关系方面，过去认为劳动人民没有什么可学，特别是对向本企业的工人学习不服气；通过同劳动人民共同劳动以后，对于劳动人民冲天的革命干劲、忘我的劳动热情，不计较个人得失和大公无私的崇高品质，以及劳动人民无穷的智慧，比过去有了进一步的体会，逐渐改变着对劳动人民的看法和态度；逐渐懂得了凡事必须要依靠群众，要向劳动人民学习；由于思想行动有所转变，和劳动人民的距离正在逐渐缩短。从工商业者家属来看，一年多来，随着人民公社化运动和社会生活福利事业的开展，在搞好家务劳动的同时，很多人开始参加了劳动锻炼，如送肥、抗旱、植树等。有的参加了公共食堂、托儿所等社会福利事业；参加了街道工作和街道所办企业的生产劳动。一些人由于成绩显著，同样受到了奖励和表扬。
    一年多来，我们工商业者和工商业者家属所以能在服务中作出成绩，在改造中取得进步，首先是党的正确领导和不断的教育帮助，同时也是受到大跃进的大好形势的推动，受到劳动人民的带动和帮助。这是党的总路线在社会主义改造事业中的伟大胜利，是党对资产阶级和平改造方针的伟大胜利。
    我们工商界虽然在服务和改造中取得了很大的成绩和进步，总的说来，资本主义一面减少了，社会主义一面增加了，但是，并没有前进到多数人解决了或者基本上解决了政治立场的地步。总的情况是大有进步，具体到我们每一个人，进步的情况却不一样，如以六条政治标准来衡量，还差得很远，我们必须还要继续改造。如，对于接受党的领导，不少人还或多或少地存在着疑虑和戒备；对于总路线、大跃进和人民公社，还有不同程度的疑虑、动摇，甚至有的人还有不满和抵触情绪。
    工商业者要一心一意地听毛主席的话，一心一意地跟着党走
    由于工商业者存在着资产阶级个人主义，所以有些人做工作多半是从个人得失来考虑，干劲鼓不足，热情也不高，怕紧张，怕困难。另外，损公肥私，贪污和挪用公款的现象还是时有发生。在和劳动人民的关系方面，不少人在向劳动人民学习的问题上仍然没有解决。有的人在服务中取得了一点成绩，就得意忘形，翘起尾巴，说和工人“差不多”了。在劳动和学习方面，许多人对参加劳动还抱着敷衍应付态度，轻的愿干，重的不愿干，人前多干，人后少干，短期可以干，长期就不干，有的则厌恶抵触。还有不少人存在着以服务代替改造的思想情绪，不愿参加学习。所有这些，都说明工商界两面性依然存在，必须继续进行改造。
    我们国家已经进入了一个生产不断跃进，思想不断革命，彻底消灭资本主义，高速度地建设社会主义的新的历史时期。为了适应客观形势飞跃发展的要求，为了跟上劳动人民跃进的步伐，我们工商界必须在现有的基础上继续进步，进一步改造自己的政治立场，并逐步树立起无产阶级的世界观，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，逐步地使自己从剥削者变为劳动者。在这伟大的六十年代里，用不断革命的精神，把我们工商业者的社会主义改造推向一个新的里程。在最近召开的民建和全国工商联会员代表大会期间，党中央刘少奇副主席给我们作了极亲切、极重要的指示和教导。党为了使我们接受社会主义改造，给予了无微不至的关怀和照顾，党和毛主席像父母一样地爱护我们，像师长一样地教育我们，使我们能够不断提高认识，增加信心，破资立社，继续前进。我们必须要真正作到“顾一头”、“一边倒”，一心顾国家利益和人民利益，坚决倒向社会主义。经验告诉我们：凡是顾整体，为社会主义作好事的人，党和人民无不给予应得的报酬，反之，钻头觅缝，只顾个人利益，总是适得其反的。
    为了今后能够做到更好地为社会主义服务，更好地进行自我改造，做到“顾一头”，“一边倒”，从我个人十年多来的生活体验中深深感到，最根本的一条就是一心一意的听毛主席的话，一心一意的跟着党走。在合营初期，我由于对党疏远、抵触，因而思想蹩扭，精神苦闷，竟至打算离开企业，摆脱党的领导，走资本主义的老路，若不是党及时的教育帮助而挽救了我，难免铸成大错。近几年来的实践，使我更进一步地体会到，只要真正靠拢党，接受党的领导，就会方向明确，胸怀开朗，心情舒畅，接受改造就有信心、有决心，进步就快，干劲就大；反之，就会迷失方向，前途茫茫，资本主义的东西就会抬头，心情就会苦闷，对改造就会厌倦、抵触，对工作就会懒心无肠，后果也就不堪设想。总之，我们要想在伟大的社会主义建设事业中贡献自己的一份力量，为国家为人民作点好事，使自己平平稳稳地走过从剥削者转变为劳动者的历程，唯一无二的只有认真听毛主席的话，一心一意的靠拢党，一心一意的接受改造，一心一意的为社会主义服务。
    以劳动实践为基础，不断进行自我改造是一条基本经验
    几年来的实践证明，要服务好改造好，就必须把服务和改造紧密地结合起来。积极参加劳动实践，并在劳动的实践过程中，不断地进行自我改造，真正作到以政治思想为统帅，以劳动实践为基础，使二者密切结合，互相促进。这是我们工商界进行自我改造的一条基本经验。我们应当接受以往的经验，继续前进，继续改造自己，一面积极参加劳动实践，一心一意为社会主义服务；一面积极参加政治学习，特别是学习毛主席的著作。在实践和学习过程中，逐步转变政治立场，逐步树立起无产阶级的世界观，使自己成为一个自食其力的光荣的劳动者。
    在这次大会以后，我们一定坚决贯彻李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席报告的精神，一心一意地在党的领导下，提高觉悟，鼓足干劲，积极投入到大跃进的行列中去，更好地做好岗位工作，更好地进行自我改造，为我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更多更大的贡献。
    末了，祝大会胜利成功！
