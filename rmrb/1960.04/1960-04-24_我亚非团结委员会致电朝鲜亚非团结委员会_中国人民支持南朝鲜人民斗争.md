Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the Korean Asian-African Solidarity Committee, resolutely supporting the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the Syngman Rhee clique. The telegram stated: "The Chinese people are extremely indignant at the recent large-scale massacres and bloody suppression by the Syngman Rhee clique, which is carrying out a fascist reign of terror in South Korea under the protection of US imperialism, against the South Korean people who have risen up in revolt. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the plight of the South Korean people and resolutely support their heroic struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique.

	"The Syngman Rhee clique has turned to US imperialism, sold out national interests, consistently antagonized the Korean people, seriously violated the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification of their country, willingly turned South Korea into a base for US imperialism to launch a new war of aggression, and has intensified its exploitation and plunder of the South Korean people, arousing increasing resentment among the South Korean people. The heroic struggle of the people of Masan and the tenacious battles launched by the people in various parts of South Korea are precisely the eruption of the long-standing anger of the South Korean people against the criminal rule of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, and also a sign that the fascist colonial rule of the US-Rhee clique in South Korea is approaching collapse. We believe that with the support of the Asian-African people and the people of the world who uphold justice, and with the support and encouragement of all the South Korean people, the South Korean people will unite and persist in their struggle, which will inflict even more disastrous defeats on the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and the American imperialists. The American aggressor troops must get out of South Korea, and the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country will surely achieve final victory."

    我亚非团结委员会致电朝鲜亚非团结委员会
    中国人民支持南朝鲜人民斗争
    新华社23讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天致电朝鲜亚非团结委员会，坚决支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的英勇斗争。电报说：“中国人民对美帝国主义包庇下在南朝鲜实行法西斯恐怖统治的李承晚集团最近大规模屠杀和血腥镇压南朝鲜起义人民，表示无比愤怒。中国人民深切同情南朝鲜人民的痛苦处境，坚决支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的英勇斗争。
    “李承晚集团投靠美帝国主义，出卖民族利益，一贯与朝鲜人民为敌，严重违反朝鲜人民要求祖国和平统一的愿望，甘心把南朝鲜变成美帝国主义重新发动侵略战争的基地，并日益加紧对南朝鲜人民进行压榨和掠夺，激起南朝鲜人民越来越大的愤慨。这次马山人民的英勇斗争和南朝鲜各地人民纷纷展开的顽强战斗，正是南朝鲜人民长期以来对美帝国主义和李承晚集团罪恶统治的愤怒的爆发，也是美李集团在南朝鲜的法西斯殖民统治愈益接近崩溃的征象。我们相信，在亚非人民和全世界主持正义的人民支持下，在全体南朝鲜人民的支持和鼓舞下，南朝鲜人民团结起来坚持斗争，将使李承晚傀儡政权和美国帝国主义者遭到更加惨重的失败。美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜滚出去，朝鲜人民要求祖国和平统一的斗争，一定取得最后的胜利。”
