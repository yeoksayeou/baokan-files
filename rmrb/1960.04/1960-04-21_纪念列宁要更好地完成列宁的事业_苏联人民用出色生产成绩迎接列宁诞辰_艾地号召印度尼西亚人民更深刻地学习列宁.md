Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 19th: In recent days, good news has been pouring in from all over the Soviet Union about the labor competition launched by the Soviet working people to greet the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth. Various activities commemorating Lenin continue to be widely carried out throughout the country. With soaring labor and political enthusiasm, the Soviet people have expressed their infinite love and remembrance for their great leader and teacher, and demonstrated their determination to accelerate the construction of communism.

Many factories and enterprises have recently overfulfilled their production plans for the first four months of this year. The Moscow Second Ball Bearing Plant, one of the initiators of the labor competition commemorating Lenin's birthday, has already produced 900,000 rubles worth of products above plan, exceeding the original plan by 50%. The "Three Mountains" Textile Factory has overproduced more than 50,000 meters of textiles. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory originally guaranteed to produce the one millionth tractor since the factory was built on April 22nd, and this guarantee has been fulfilled ahead of schedule.

Agricultural laborers have also achieved outstanding results in the competition. The sowing speed of spring crops in mid-April was greatly accelerated compared with the beginning of April. As of April 15th, more than 8.63 million hectares of spring crops have been sown nationwide. In the southern regions, wheat, sunflower, sugar beet, vegetables, etc. are being sown intensively. In the Central Asian republics, in Azerbaijan and southern Kazakhstan, cotton sowing is in full swing.

Reports and exhibitions on Lenin continue to be held everywhere. Many political and social activists, as well as veteran communists, advanced producers, and university teachers who fought and worked with Lenin, have gone to various places to give reports. Scientific research institutions have also successively held scientific conferences on Lenin's revolutionary activities and the theoretical issues of Leninism. Factories, enterprises and collective farms have set up exhibition rooms commemorating Lenin. A large-scale exhibition introducing Lenin's works opened at the Soviet State Lenin Library on the 13th.

To commemorate Lenin's birthday, voluntary Sundays and Saturdays have been universally carried out throughout the country recently. A large number of members of the Communist Youth League, college students, and employees of factories and enterprises participated in urban cleaning and greening work. The Kursk Locomotive Depot and many other industrial and mining enterprises have proposed that Communist Sunday labor commemorating Lenin should be carried out every year in the future. This initiative has been widely supported by the broad masses of workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 19th: D.N. Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, today called on the Indonesian people to study Lenin more profoundly. He said that for the Indonesian people, studying Lenin means understanding the path to complete the Indonesian revolution.

Aidit said this when he presided over the opening ceremony of the Lenin's Life and Works Exhibition held in Jakarta. He pointed out that Lenin still lives among the working people and oppressed people of all nations in the world. He continues to inspire the struggle for liberation, socialism and peace.

The Lenin's Life and Works Exhibition held here this afternoon is one of a series of activities held by the Indonesian people to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth. The exhibition shows the influence of Lenin's works on the Indonesian revolution. Among the exhibits are some photocopies of publications edited by some initiators of the Indonesian democratic movement more than 40 years ago. Although these publications were written in Dutch, they enthusiastically introduced Lenin to readers and praised the Russian revolution. The exhibits also include Lenin's works printed since the official establishment of the Communist Party of Indonesia.

The resolution prepared by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth was also announced here today. The resolution calls on Indonesian revolutionaries to study Lenin's works more and better. The resolution said that Lenin's theories on imperialism, socialist revolution, the revolution in the East, the revolutionary united front, the worker-peasant alliance, party building, and other aspects are the most reliable guidepost for the Indonesian revolution.

    新华社莫斯科19日电　近日来，各地纷纷传来苏联劳动人民为迎接列宁诞生九十周年而发起的劳动竞赛的捷报。各种纪念列宁的活动继续在全国范围内广泛展开。苏联人民以高涨的劳动和政治热情表达了他们对伟大领袖和导师的无限热爱和追忆，体现了他们加速共产主义建设的决心。
    许多工厂企业最近都超额完成了今年头四个月的生产计划。纪念列宁诞辰的劳动竞赛的发起者之一——莫斯科第二滚珠轴承厂目前已经超计划生产了价值九十万卢布的产品，超额完成了原订计划的50％。“三山”纺织厂已经超计划生产了五万多米纺织品。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂原保证要在4月22日生产出建厂以来的第一百万台拖拉机，这个保证已经提前实现。
    农业劳动者在竞赛中也获得了出色的成绩。4月中旬的春播作物的播种速度比4月上旬大大加快。到4月15日为止，全国已经播种了八百六十三万多公顷的春播作物。南方地区正在加紧播种小麦、向日葵、甜菜、蔬菜等。在中亚细亚各共和国，在阿塞拜疆和哈萨克南部，棉花播种工作正在紧张进行。
    各地都在继续举行关于列宁的报告会和展览会。许多政治和社会活动家以及同列宁一起斗争和工作过的老共产党员、先进生产者、高等学校的教师等，都分别到各地去作报告。科学研究机关也相继举行关于列宁的革命活动和列宁主义理论问题的科学会议。各工厂企业和集体农庄都布置了纪念列宁的展览室。介绍列宁著作的大型展览会13日已在苏联国家列宁图书馆开幕。
    为纪念列宁诞辰，最近全国各地普遍进行了义务星期日和星期六劳动。大批共青团员、大学生、工厂企业的职工参加了城市的清洁卫生和绿化工作。库尔斯克机车库以及许多其它工矿企业都提出，今后每年都进行纪念列宁的共产主义星期日劳动。这一倡议得到了各地广大职工的普遍支持。
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地今天号召印度尼西亚人民更深刻地学习列宁。他说，对印度尼西亚人民来说，学习列宁意味着认识完成印度尼西亚革命的道路。
    这是艾地在主持在雅加达举行的列宁生平和著作展览会的开幕典礼时说的。他指出，列宁仍然在全世界一切民族的劳动人民和被压迫人民中间活着。他仍然鼓舞着争取解放、社会主义和和平的斗争。
    今天下午在这里举行的列宁生平和著作展览会，是印度尼西亚人民为纪念列宁诞生九十周年而举行的一系列活动之一。展览会显示了列宁的著作对印度尼西亚革命的影响。展览品中有某些印度尼西亚民主运动的倡导者在四十多年以前编辑的出版物的某些影印本。这些出版物虽然是用荷兰文撰写的，但是它们热情地向读者介绍了列宁，并且赞扬俄国的革命。展览品中还有印度尼西亚共产党正式建立以来所印行的列宁的著作。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会宣传鼓动部为纪念列宁诞生九十周年而准备的决议今天也在这里公布。决议号召印度尼西亚革命者更多和更好地研究列宁的著作。决议说，列宁关于帝国主义、社会主义革命、东方的革命、革命统一战线、工农联盟、党的建设和其他方面的理论是印度尼西亚革命最可靠的路标。
