    South Korean People's Struggle Fierce, Syngman Rhee Ousted
    Korean Democratic People's Republic Political Parties and Organizations Hold Joint Meeting and Issue Statement
    Calling on the South Korean People to Continue the Struggle, to Make the U.S. Aggressor Troops Withdraw Immediately, and Completely Abolish the Traitorous Rule

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Under the heavy blow of the surging struggle of the South Korean people, the agent of U.S. imperialism in ruling South Korea, the dictator Syngman Rhee, who carried out twelve years of fascist terror rule in South Korea, was forced to announce his resignation. He submitted his resignation to the South Korean "National Assembly" on the afternoon of the 27th. According to foreign news agencies, Syngman Rhee has "disappeared." It is said that he has secretly left Seoul and gone into hiding.

    Prior to this, the "cabinet ministers" of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime had collectively resigned on the 21st. The Syngman Rhee puppet "cabinet" has collapsed.

    Under the impact of the wave of people's struggle, the South Korean ruling clique is disintegrating. The Syngman Rhee's party members, who gathered together with the goal of vying for power and profit, are now scattering like frightened birds when the tree falls.

    The struggle of the South Korean people is still developing. In Busan City, several hundred people held demonstrations on the 27th against the U.S.-Rhee group.

    In this struggle against the U.S.-Rhee group, the South Korean people have become increasingly clear that the U.S. imperialist military occupation and the destruction of their national unification are the root cause of their current suffering. They demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy. They distributed leaflets with the words "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of South Korea Immediately," which is the common call of the South Korean people.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Leaders of political parties and social organizations of the Korean Democratic People's Republic held a joint meeting in Pyongyang today to discuss the current situation in South Korea.

    Park Kum-chul, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, made a report at the meeting. He said that in order to clean up the current chaotic and urgent situation in South Korea and meet the demands of the people, the U.S. aggressor troops must first be withdrawn from South Korea immediately, and the traitorous rule of Syngman Rhee must be completely abolished.

    Park Kum-chul emphasized that the U.S. imperialists must be held responsible for the crimes they have committed in South Korea. The U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible and must not interfere with the Korean people in solving their own problems. He also said that the ruling institutions of Syngman Rhee must be thoroughly abolished from top to bottom. Syngman Rhee must be arrested immediately and handed over to the people for trial.

    He said that in order to abolish the puppet ruling institutions, a temporary administrative body composed of representatives of workers, peasants, and other people from all walks of life should be established to temporarily exercise the power of the South Korean government.

    He emphasized that in order to clean up the current situation in South Korea and open up the current situation of the motherland, a joint meeting of political parties and social organizations of North and South Korea must be convened as soon as possible to gather together to formulate a policy for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and to peacefully reunify the motherland by the Korean people themselves as soon as possible.

    Finally, the meeting adopted a statement on the situation in South Korea issued in the name of the political parties and social organizations. (Detailed report and full text of the statement on page five)

    南朝鲜人民斗争炽烈　李承晚被赶下台
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、团体举行联席会议并发表声明
    号召南朝鲜人民继续斗争，使美国侵略军立即撤走，完全废除卖国统治
    据新华社讯　在南朝鲜人民汹涌澎湃的斗争的沉重打击下，美帝国主义统治南朝鲜的代理人、在南朝鲜进行了十二年法西斯恐怖统治的独裁者——李承晚被迫宣告下台。他在27日下午向南朝鲜“国会”提出辞呈。据外国通讯社报道，李承晚已经“下落不明”。据说，他已经偷偷地离开汉城躲藏起来了。
    在这以前，李承晚伪政权的“内阁部长”们已经在21日集体辞职。李承晚傀儡“内阁”已经垮台。
    在人民斗争浪潮的冲击下，南朝鲜统治集团内部分崩离析。在争权夺利的目标下纠成一伙的李承晚的党徒们现在是“树倒猢狲散”。
    南朝鲜人民的斗争还在发展。釜山市27日又有数百人举行了反对美李集团的示威游行。
    在这次反对美李集团的斗争中，南朝鲜人民已经愈来愈清楚地看到美帝国主义的军事占领和破坏他们祖国统一是他们目前苦难的根源。他们在美国大使馆前面示威。他们散发写着“美帝国主义赶快滚出南朝鲜”的传单，这是南朝鲜人民的共同呼声。（详细报道见第五版）
    据新华社讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、社会团体的领导人今天在平壤举行联席会议，讨论目前南朝鲜的局势。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆在会上作了报告。他说，要收拾南朝鲜目前混乱而紧迫的局势、满足人民的要求，首先要使美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤走，完全废除李承晚卖国统治。
    朴金喆强调指出，美帝国主义者必须对它在南朝鲜犯下的罪过负责。美国军队必须早日从南朝鲜撤走，不能对朝鲜人民解决自己的问题进行干涉。他还说，必须从上层到基层彻底废除李承晚的统治机构。立即把李承晚逮捕起来，交给人民审判。
    他说，为了废除傀儡统治机构，要成立由工人、农民等各界人民代表组成的临时行政机构，临时行使南朝鲜的政权。
    他强调说，为了收拾南朝鲜的目前局势，和打开祖国目前的局面，必须早日召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体的联席会议，共聚一堂，制订和平统一祖国的方针，早日由朝鲜人民自己和平统一祖国。
    最后，会议通过了以各政党、社会团体的名义发表的关于南朝鲜局势的声明。（会议详细报道和声明全文见第五版）
