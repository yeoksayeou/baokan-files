Comrades Representatives:
I completely agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The General Line and the policy of "walking on two legs" are excellent. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the whole country is showing a flourishing new atmosphere. Mountains are changing, water is changing, everything is changing. What reason do we industrialists and businessmen have not to change? Taking Shaanxi Province as an example, under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels in our province and with the enthusiastic help of the broad masses of workers, more and more industrialists and businessmen have promoted the transformation of political thought through labor practice. Especially in the in-depth study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, inspired and educated by the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, they have realized the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Party. Many people have more actively reported their thoughts to the Party, and they have also more actively learned from the workers in their work. The majority of people have joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, working alongside the workers, and have made achievements to varying degrees in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. According to incomplete statistics from eleven cities and counties including Baoji and Weinan: a total of 21,845 rationalization proposals were put forward in terms of inventions, creations, reform tools, and improvement of business management, of which 11,002 were adopted or implemented. Many people were rated as red banner bearers, advanced producers, advanced workers, and other advanced titles. At the same time, their feelings for the Party and socialism have gradually increased. This is indeed a progress for us industrialists and businessmen. This progress fully proves that the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of us industrialists and businessmen has achieved a great victory.

However, our progress is only a step forward on the road from bourgeois elements to working people. It is not that we have been transformed almost completely, but that we are far from it. The political stance of the vast majority of people has not been resolved, and duality still exists. This is a serious problem. For example, some people still have the idea of ​​"an ugly daughter-in-law afraid of seeing her parents-in-law" when reporting to the Party, and they go as little as possible, and if they can not go they will not go. They have more or less doubts and precautions about the Party and have not truly achieved wholehearted devotion to the Party. Although they talk about learning from the working class, they have not completely kept it in mind. They often feel that the workers are full of energy and the situation is compelling, so they have to do it. Some people say, "This is asking me to work, not me wanting to work." They are not active enough towards the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and hold the attitude of "ringing the bell as a monk for a day" in their work. A few people even say that if it weren't for eating, they wouldn't even want to ring the bell. They often believe in the brilliant achievements of the three treasures of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune when listening to the reports of the leaders, but waver when they encounter specific personal problems. In short, most people still put "I" first in everything, and have more or less resistance to national and overall interests; on the two roads, they often waver from side to side. Therefore, their actions are always slower than those of the working people, and their pace always cannot keep up with the leaping situation. Now that the situation is getting better and better, and the pace of the leap forward is getting bigger and bigger, we are far behind the situation. How can we still put "I" first! How can we still waver! The Party teaches us to "favor one side" and "lean to one side." This is indeed the key issue for industrialists and businessmen to further accept socialist transformation. We must firmly remember to combine service and transformation, constantly revolutionize, and advance victoriously to join the people of the whole country in moving from victory to new victory.

In whatever aspect we must adhere to the Party's instruction of "favoring one side and leaning to one side," and actively participate in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation), which is an important link in implementing this instruction. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, "Since 1958, we have had one movement after another on all economic fronts... In the movements, we have trained a large number of cadres, and also trained a wider range of the people." Through these movements, especially this technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on "four modernizations", the private staff in our province combine service and transformation, and gradually realize the importance of "favoring one side" and "leaning to one side." The determination to actively serve and strengthen transformation is growing. The combination of service and transformation is also becoming closer and closer. For example, Chen Heshen, a private staff member of the Xi'an Automobile Parts Factory, which is a joint state-private enterprise, also put "I" first at the beginning and was indifferent to technological innovation. Later, seeing that the workers were full of energy and confidence, he was also a little moved, but he was afraid that he would not get the Party's support and that he would not be able to make a name for himself and lose face. After the Party and the public side patiently educated him and untied this knot, he was still not convinced by the workers. When Zheng Tianyu, an apprentice, improved the inner eye grinder chuck and increased the efficiency by three times, he thought it was a "lucky hit." Who knew that new people and new things emerged one after another, and miracles came one after another. In just a few months, most of the factory achieved automation. Only then did he realize the unparalleled superiority of socialism and gradually leaned towards the socialist side. He no longer disbelieved the workers and no longer engaged in his own set of things. He was with the workers, working as a fitter during the day and a lathe operator at night. The circulator, which was originally planned to be completed in one month, was completed in three days due to the hard work and ingenuity of the workers. This gave him a vivid socialist education, further drew him closer to the Party and the workers, and continuously overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the leaders. He was rated as the factory's red banner bearer and the advanced producer of the city's metallurgical and electrical system. The workers sometimes directly called him by his nickname - Heshen, and he felt particularly cordial. He deeply realized that he must resolutely lean to the socialist side in order to truly work selflessly. Only selfless labor can he realize the glory, greatness, and happiness of labor; and only selfless labor can he shorten the distance between himself and the workers. The factory has more than 70 private staff members, and there are many examples like Chen Heshen. As far as the situation of the factories in our province is concerned, there are many examples like the Automobile Parts Factory. Facts have repeatedly proved that the more actively the private staff participate in technological innovation and technological revolution, the deeper their understanding of "favoring one side" and "leaning to one side" will be. Now that the movement is deepening step by step, we must continue to follow up, and constantly carry out self-transformation in the process of work practice, in order to transform ourselves from an exploiter into a glorious laborer who relies on his own labor.

The facts are very clear: service and transformation are mutually reinforcing. As this technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" deepens, we can strengthen self-education and self-transformation in the practice of service, but we will also encounter some new problems and difficulties. How to solve these problems and difficulties? I think the key to the key, the core of the core, the fundamental of the fundamental, there is only one: that is to resolutely rely on the Party, tell the Party the truth, and follow the Party wholeheartedly. The Party is the embodiment of truth and the fundamental guarantee of socialist revolution and socialist construction. As long as we accept the leadership and education of the Party and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, all problems and difficulties can be solved easily. Chairman Mao is the embodiment of the Chinese Communist Party. To truly and resolutely rely on the Party, we must actively study Mao Zedong Thought, recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is victory, thereby raising political awareness, understanding the laws of social development, recognizing the situation, recognizing the future, and establishing a flesh-and-blood relationship and a life-and-death relationship with the Party, so that we can truly achieve "favoring one side" and "leaning to one side." Only by truly achieving "favoring one side" and "leaning to one side" can we make great progress, can we make greater achievements in our work, and can we have a bright future.

I once again express our confidence and determination to the Party:
Remolding is far from enough, we must "favor one side";
The situation is infinitely good, we will resolutely "lean to one side."

### 改造很不够，一定“顾一头”  形势无限好，坚决“一边倒”  韩望尘代表的发言

    改造很不够，一定“顾一头”  形势无限好，坚决“一边倒”
    韩望尘代表的发言各位代表：
    李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告以及人大常务委员会的工作报告，我完全同意和拥护。总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针太好了，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国一片欣欣向荣的新气象，山在变，水在变，一切都在变，我们工商业者还有什么理由不变呢？以陕西省为例，在我省各级党委的正确领导下，在广大职工同志的热情帮助下，越来越多的工商业者通过劳动实践，带动了政治思想改造。特别是在深入学习党的八届八中全会文件中，受到总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞教育，认识到党的伟大、光荣、正确，不少人比较主动地向党汇报思想，在工作中也比较主动地向职工学习，大多数人投入了大跃进的行列，跟上职工一道，在以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，程度不同的作出成绩。据宝鸡、渭南等十一个市县的不完全统计：在发明创造，改革工具以及改善经营管理等方面，共提合理化建议二万一千八百四十五件，被采纳或实现的就有一万一千零二件。不少人被评为红旗手，先进生产者，先进工作者及其他先进称号，同时对党和社会主义的感情，逐渐增加。这的确是我们工商业者的进步。这个进步充分证明，党对我们工商业者的和平改造政策取得了伟大的胜利。
    但是，我们的进步只是由资产阶级分子向劳动人民转化的道路上跨进了一步，并不是改造得差不多了，而是差得很远，绝大多数人的政治立场问题并没有解决，两面性依然存在，这是一个严重的问题。例如有些人向党汇报，还有一种“丑媳妇怕见婆婆”的思想，能少去就少去，能不去就不去。他们对党或多或少存在着疑虑和戒备，没有真正作到对党一心一意。对于向工人阶级学习，虽然挂在嘴上，却没有完全记在心上。往往感到工人干劲冲天，形势逼人，自己不得不干。有人说“这是要我劳动，不是我要劳动”。他们对于总路线、大跃进和人民公社，还不够积极，在工作上抱着“做一日和尚撞一日钟”的态度，少数人甚至还说，如不是为了吃饭，连钟也不想撞。对于总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝的辉煌成就，往往听首长报告时相信，碰到个人具体问题时又动摇。总而言之，多数人还处处“我”字当头，对国家利益和整体利益或多或少还有抵触；在两条道路上，往往左右摇摆。所以行动总是比劳动人民迟缓，步伐总是跟不上跃进的形势。现在形势愈来愈好，跃进的步伐愈来愈大，我们已远远落在形势的后面，怎么还能“我”字当头呢！怎么还能摇摆呢！党教导我们“顾一头”、“一边倒”。这确是当前工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造的关键问题。我们必须牢牢记住，把服务和改造结合起来，不断革命，乘胜前进，才能和全国人民一道，从胜利走向新的胜利。
    我们不论在那一方面，都要坚持党的“顾一头，一边倒”的指示，而积极参加以“四化”（机械化、半机械化，自动化，半自动化）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，则是贯彻执行这个指示的重要环节。李富春副总理在他的报告中说“1958年以来，我们在各个经济战线上，一个运动接着一个运动，……在运动中，锻炼了广大干部，也锻炼了更广大的人民群众。”我省私方人员通过这些运动，特别是这一次以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，把服务和改造结合起来，逐渐认识到“顾一头”，“一边倒”的重要性。积极服务和加强改造的决心，越来越大了。服务与改造相结合，也越来越密切了。例如公私合营西安汽车配件厂私方人员陈和申，开始也是“我”字当头，对技术革新漠不关心。后来看见工人干劲冲天，信心很大，思想上也动了一下，但又怕得不到党的支持，搞不出名堂来丢面子。经过党和公方耐心教育，解开了这个疙瘩，但又对工人不服气，徒工郑天玉改进里眼磨床卡具提高工效三倍，他还认为这是“冒碰的”。那知新人新事层出不穷，奇迹接二连三而来，不出几个月的时间全厂大部实现自动化。这才认识到社会主义无比的优越性，逐渐倒向社会主义这一边。他再也不对工人不服气了，也不专搞自己的一套了。他和工人在一起，白天当钳工，晚上当车工，原计划一月才能完成的循环器，由于工人们苦干加巧干，三天就完成了，这使他受到一次活生生的社会主义教育，进一步靠拢了党和工人，接连超额完成了领导上交给的任务。被评为厂的红旗手和市冶金机电系统的先进生产者。工人有时直呼他的小名——和尚，他觉得格外亲切。他深深地体会到必须坚决倒向社会主义这一边，才能真正忘我劳动。只有忘我的劳动，才能认识劳动的光荣、伟大和快乐；也只有忘我的劳动，才能缩短和工人之间的距离。该厂共有私方人员七十多人，像陈和申这样的例子还不少。就我省各厂的情况而言，像汽车配件厂这样的例子也很多。事实一再证明，私方人员参加技术革新和技术革命愈积极，对于“顾一头”“一边倒”的认识也将愈深刻。现在运动步步深入，我们必须继续跟上去，在工作实践的过程中，不断地进行自我改造，才能把自己从一个剥削者改造成为自食其力的光荣劳动者。
    事实摆得很明显，服务与改造是相辅相成的。随着这个以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动日益深入，我们在服务的实践过程中更能加强自我教育和自我改造，但也将会遇到一些新的问题和困难。如何解决这些问题和困难呢？我认为关键的关键，核心的核心，根本的根本，只有一条，就是坚决依靠党，向党说真话，一心一意跟党走。党是真理的化身，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的根本保证，只要接受党的领导和教育，用毛主席的思想武装我们的头脑，一切问题和困难都能迎刃而解。毛主席是中国共产党的化身，要作到真正坚决依靠党，必须积极学习毛泽东思想，认识毛泽东思想就是胜利，从而提高政治觉悟，认识社会发展规律，认清形势，认清前途，和党建立血肉关系生死关系的感情，才能真正作到“顾一头”“一边倒”。也只有真正作到“顾一头”“一边倒”，才能大有进步，才能在工作上做出更大的成绩，才能有光明的前途。
    我再一次向党表示我们的信心和决心：
    改造很不够，一定“顾一头”；
    形势无限好，坚决“一边倒”。
