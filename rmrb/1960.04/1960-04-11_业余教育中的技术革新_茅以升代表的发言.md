    Technological Innovation in Amateur Education
    Speech by Representative Mao Yisheng

    Chairman, fellow representatives, comrades:

    After listening to the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and learning about the thriving atmosphere in all aspects of the country since the Great Leap Forward and the unprecedentedly grand national economic plan for this year, I feel infinitely excited, and I express my heartfelt support for these three reports.

    Recently, I inspected Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan and other places. Although the time was short, I encountered many new people and new things, and the impression was very deep. In particular, I personally witnessed the vigorous technological innovation movement and the colorful achievements of amateur education, which have formed a nationwide upsurge, and I was greatly encouraged.

    In the technological innovation movement, a very common phenomenon is that a workshop, work site, or cafeteria is completely mechanized, or even automated, in a very short period of time. However, the masses participating in the innovation do not have any theoretical "foundation" in natural sciences, and they do not reach out to the organization for money or equipment. It can be said that they generally started from "poverty and blankness," completely defeating the various "condition theories" that once existed in our scientific research work.

    In terms of amateur education, a very common phenomenon is that the closer the teaching procedures, teaching methods, and teaching materials are integrated with the actual production of each student at that time and place, the greater the achievements. This strengthens the confidence of the masses in participating in amateur learning and satisfies their urgent desire to learn. Therefore, some amateur schools are determined to train employees who have just become literate to university level within five to seven years. The recent establishment of the Central Amateur Education Committee has given them even greater encouragement. It can be asserted that, through amateur education, the day when the difference between manual and mental labor is eliminated among the workers and peasants across the country is not far away. This will be a miracle in the history of education, showing the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system.

    Of course, the great achievements of technological innovation and amateur education are interconnected and inseparable; they promote each other and improve each other, so that the upsurge of technological revolution and cultural revolution converge into an even more magnificent torrent. These are all great victories of political command and mass movements under the leadership of the Party! They are the brilliant achievements of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes!

    Now, based on some of the experiences and insights I have learned about technological innovation and amateur education during my inspection, and some of the feelings I have derived from them, I would like to offer some suggestions for the comrades to correct.

    First of all, the workers and peasants who have rich production experience are not so-called "scientific illiterates," but have already mastered many scientific methods, scientific principles, and scientific laws in their professional fields. They have fully grasped many phenomena in science and technology "know what it is," that is, they already have a lot of scientific "qualitative knowledge." This scientific knowledge is an important guarantee for them to achieve continuous victories in technological innovation. They generally have no opportunity to learn the "basic" theory of science, but they can conduct scientific research and make inventions in technological innovation. Without a "foundation" of scientific theory, being able to contribute to scientific research is something that scientists in capitalist countries cannot understand. However, the brilliant future of China's unlimited prosperity in science rests on the shoulders of our broad masses of workers and peasants!

    Secondly, the significant achievements of amateur education are fully manifested in the teaching method of "learning while doing, doing while learning," so that what is done today is learned tomorrow, and what is learned today is done tomorrow, constantly elevating perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and then using rational knowledge to improve and expand the scope of perceptual knowledge. This teaching method of combining theory with practice precisely follows Chairman Mao's instructions in "On Practice": "Rational knowledge depends upon perceptual knowledge, and perceptual knowledge remains to be developed into rational knowledge." Many people, through amateur education, have solved major key problems in technological innovation. This dependency relationship is also clearly indicated in "On Practice:" "The dynamic role of knowledge manifests itself not only in the dynamic leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, but, what is more important, it must manifest itself in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice."

    Combining the above two situations, it can be seen that in technological innovation and amateur education, due to the unprecedented improvement of socialist consciousness under the Party's education, the workers and peasants, while going all out and striving for production, also break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and constantly fight against historical conventions and traditions in scientific research and the education system, creating many new methods and experiences day by day. From the perspective of the education system, this is even inevitable. It is the superstructure. When the economic base changes, it will of course have to be reformed accordingly. The more thorough the reform and the more it is combined with reality, the greater its achievements. In amateur education, such reform is also a kind of technological innovation.

    There are many technological innovations in amateur education, one of which is the innovation of teaching methods. The achievements of amateur education in this regard are very significant. However, this innovation is endless. There is still a lot of potential to be tapped. One potential is about the sequential arrangement of science and technology courses. One arrangement believes that since subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry are "basic" theories, they should be learned first, while professional technologies in production, since they are applications of science, should be learned later in order to meet the requirements of "subject systematization." In fact, for amateur education, in order to "combine with production and teach students according to their aptitude," it should have its own set of systematization, which is "production systematization." This systematization is comprehensive for subjects, just as subject systematization is comprehensive for production. These two types of systematization each have their own importance, either learning according to subject systematization and then systematizing in production, or learning according to production systematization and then systematizing in subjects. The former teaching method is "subject-led task," which is "specialization on a theoretical basis;" the latter is "task-led subject," which is "theorizing on a professional basis." If the former is a "foreign method," then the latter can be called a "native method." Here, we can also combine native and foreign methods and walk on two legs. Workers and peasants with production experience, as mentioned above, are no longer scientific illiterates. They already have perceptual and qualitative knowledge of a certain professional science and technology and are able to know what it is. What they generally lack is to rise to theory, rise to "quantitative knowledge," and rise to "know why it is so." The teaching method of production systematization starts from this foundation, learning technologies closely related to current production first according to the production system, then learning theories closely related to these technologies, and then, as production develops, moving from more advanced technologies to more advanced theories, and in this process, systematically classifying the learned theories into subjects in separate sections. "Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge," repeating this cycle, each stage is theorizing on a professional basis. This is also using tasks to lead subjects, with tasks as the key link and subjects as the outline, "when the key link is grasped, the outline falls into place." This is a learning method that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and it conforms to the spirit of the General Line. Amateur learning is different from ordinary school learning, just as literacy is different from elementary school students learning to read. General "illiterates" are not completely culturally illiterate, but only "character illiterate." It is completely different to learn to read with a certain level of cultural knowledge compared to elementary school students learning culture from learning to read. Workers and peasants with rich production experience have, in their work, already "taken a look and drawn a stroke" at the science "dragon," already drawing the outline. Amateur education is to process this outline to make it truly look like a dragon, and to "dot the eyes" for this dragon. Once the eyes are dotted, the dragon will come to life!

    How the science and technology courses in amateur education should be arranged is an important issue at present. It is hoped that the relevant education departments in industry and agriculture can use the above opinions as a reference when studying this issue and provide criticism and correction to it.

### 业余教育中的技术革新  茅以升代表的发言

    业余教育中的技术革新
    茅以升代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    听了李富春副总理李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告，了解到大跃进以来全国各方面的兴隆气象和今年空前宏伟的国民经济计划，感到无限兴奋，我对这三个报告都表示衷心的拥护。
    最近我往西安、成都、重庆、武汉等地视察，时间虽短，遇到许多新人新事，印象极深。特别是亲眼看到如火如荼的技术革新运动和万紫千红的业余教育成就，都已在全国形成满堂红的高潮，得到很大鼓舞。
    在技术革新运动中，一个很普遍的现象是：在极短期间内而把一个车间或作场或食堂完全机械化了，甚至自动化了，但是参加革新的群众并没有什么自然科学的理论“基础”，而且也不向组织伸手要钱要器材。可以说，一般都是“一穷二白”起家的，完全打垮了我们科学研究工作中曾经有过的各种“条件论”。
    在业余教育方面，一个很普遍的现象是：凡是教学程序、教学方法和所用教材，能和每个学员当时当地的生产实际，结合得愈紧密的，成就愈大。这就坚定了群众参加业余学习的信心，满足了他们迫切要求学习的愿望。因此，有的业余学校下了决心，要把才“脱盲”的职工，在五年到七年内培养到大学水平。最近中央成立了业余教育委员会，更给了他们以极大的鼓舞。可以断言，通过业余教育，在全国工农群众中，消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别的日子，已经不太远了。这将是教育史上的一个奇迹，显示出我们社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    当然，技术革新和业余教育的巨大成就是彼此联系而不可分的；相互促进，相互提高，就使技术革命与文化革命的高潮，汇成一股更加壮阔的洪流。这都是党领导下的政治挂帅和群众运动的伟大胜利！是总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的辉煌战果！
    现在，就我在视察中，对技术革新和业余教育所学习到的一些经验和心得，并由此而体会出的一些感想，作为建议，提请同志们指正。
    首先，有了丰富生产经验的工农群众并非所谓“科学盲”，而是在他们的专业范围内，已经掌握了不少科学方法、科学道理和科学规律的。他们对科学技术中的许多现象已经充分地“知其然”，也就是已经有了不少的科学上的“定性知识”。他们的这些科学知识是他们能够在技术革新中取得不断胜利的一个重要保证。他们一般都没有机会学习过科学的“基础”理论，但却能在技术革新中进行科学研究，有了创造发明。没有科学理论作“基础”，而能在科学研究上作出贡献，这在资本主义国家的科学家，是无法了解的。然而，我国科学的无限繁荣的光辉前景，正是寄托在我们的广大工农劳动人民的肩上！
    其次，业余教育的重大成就完全表现在“边做边学、边学边做”的教学方法，使得今天做的，明天就学，今天学的，明天就做，天天把感性知识上升到理性知识，再从理性知识来提高和扩大感性知识的范围。这种理论结合实际的教学方法正是遵从了毛主席实践论中的指示：“理性认识依赖于感性认识，感性认识有待于发展到理性认识”。很多群众，通过业余教育，在技术革新中解决了重大关键问题。这种依赖关系，也就是实践论中所明确指示的：“认识的能动作用，不但表现于从感性的认识到理性的认识之能动的飞跃，更重要的还须表现于从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃。”
    结合以上两种情况，可见在技术革新和业余教育中，由于在党的教育下，社会主义觉悟空前提高，工农群众在鼓足干劲、努力生产的同时，还破除迷信、解放思想，对科学研究与教育制度中的历史性陈规与传统，时刻作斗争，创造出日新又新的许多方法与经验。从教育制度言，这更是势所必至的，它是上层建筑，经济基础变了，它当然不得不跟着要改革。改革得愈彻底的，愈能结合实际的，它的成就愈大。在业余教育中，这样的改革，也是一种技术革新。
    业余教育中的技术革新很多，其中之一就是教学方法的革新。各地业余教育在这方面的成就是非常巨大的。不过这种革新是无止境的，百尺竿头，再进一步，其中还有不少潜力可挖。一种潜力就是关于科学技术课程的先后安排程序。有一种安排程序认为：既然数学、物理、化学等课是“基础”理论，就应当先学，而生产中的专业技术，既然是科学的应用，就应当后学，才能符合“学科系统化”的要求。其实，业余教育，为了“结合生产、因材施教”，就应当另有它自己的一套系统化，这便是“生产系统化”。这种系统化，对学科言，是综合的，犹如学科系统化，对生产言，是综合的，一样。这两种系统化各有其重要性，或者按照学科系统化学习，然后在生产中系统化，或者按照生产系统化学习，然后在学科中系统化。前一种教学方法是“学科带任务”，是“理论基础上专业化”；后一种是“任务带学科”，是“专业基础上理论化”。如果前一种是“洋法”，那么，后一种可称“土法”，这里也可土洋并举，两条腿走路。有了生产经验的工农群众，如上所说，已经不是科学盲，已经对某一专业的科学技术有了感性的定性知识，能够知其然；他们一般所缺乏的，只是要上升到理论，上升到“定量知识”，上升到“知其所以然”。生产系统化的教学方法，正是从这基础上出发，按照生产系统，先学与当前生产有密切关系的技术，后学与这技术有密切关系的理论，然后随着生产发展，再从较高级技术到较高级理论，并在这过程中，将所学理论，分别段落，加以学科系统化。“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，”如此往复循环，在每一阶段，都是在专业基础上理论化。这也就是以任务带学科，任务为纲，学科为目，“纲举而目张”。这是一个多快好省的学习方法，是符合总路线精神的。业余学习不同于普通学校学习，犹如扫盲不同于小学生识字一样。一般“文盲”并非完全文化盲，而只是“字盲”，有了一定文化水平来识字，和小学生从识字中来学文化，是完全不同的。有了丰富生产经验的工农群众，在工作中，对于科学这条“龙”，“看一眼、画一笔”，已经画出了轮廓，业余教育就是要为这轮廓加工，使它真正像条龙，并为这条龙“点睛”，点了睛，龙就活了！
    业余教育中的科学技术课程，应该如何安排，是当前的一个重要问题，希望工农业中的有关教育部门，在研究这个问题时，能把上面意见作为参考，并对它给以批评和指正。
