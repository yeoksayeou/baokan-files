    Workers say: If we are poor, we will work! Hard work pushes mountains down, drilling breaks through the sky. As long as we work, we are not afraid of difficulties; difficulties are afraid of tough guys. Even if there are thousands of difficulties, they cannot withstand clever work!
    
    Liu Jianxi, representative, talks about the rapid construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway:
    Fellow representatives:
  I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 draft state budget, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now I would like to express some opinions on the railway construction situation in Guizhou Province.
    Since the opening of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway to Guiyang last year, railway construction in Guizhou has been accelerating. At present, the Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guizhou railways are under construction, and many branch lines and dedicated lines for factories and mines are being built in batches. The prospect of an emerging railway network has already been displayed before us. The long-cherished wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou are about to become a reality. This is a great achievement of the people of all ethnic groups in our province in building railways under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and under the brilliant light of the General Line.
    Building railways in the mountainous areas of Guizhou often encounters new problems that have not been encountered in the past: complex terrain and geology, many bridges and tunnels, many karst caves in the tunnels, turbulent underground water, and sometimes even building bridges vertically and horizontally in the tunnels; large amount of earthwork, averaging up to 180,000 to 250,000 cubic meters per kilometer, and individual 100-meter lines reaching more than 74,000 cubic meters. The lines meander in deep mountains and canyons, with cliffs everywhere, and a large amount of labor cannot be used, etc. All these have brought many inconveniences to railway construction, and the initial construction methods mostly used manual carrying, with very low work efficiency. In the first half of 1959, the comprehensive average work efficiency of earthwork in most construction units was only 1.8 cubic meters per work day. Obviously, this is not compatible with the needs of the development of the railway construction cause. Under the great encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, last year the railway workers of the whole province opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted their energy, and launched a high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution, in which the Xinluo Village rapid construction site greatly accelerated the construction speed.
    Xinluo Village is one of the key projects on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway between Guiyang and Xifeng. This work site has a large mountain in the middle and deep gullies at both ends. According to the construction requirements, most of the mountain in the middle must be cut off, and the deep gullies at both ends must be filled. Some places need to be excavated to a depth of 26 meters, and some places need to be filled to a height of 23 meters. The total amount of earthwork to be excavated and filled is more than 600,000 cubic meters. Such a huge project is concentrated on a light bulb-shaped curve that is only 1,100 meters long and has a radius of 300 meters, with a large workload, a small work surface, and difficult construction. However, the workers at the Xinluo Village construction site were not intimidated by the difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party, they vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, and created and used five categories of 32 types of 320 small machines in a self-reliant and appropriate manner. They not only eliminated shoulder carrying, but also operated simultaneously on three layers in a 250-meter-long and 50-meter-high construction site, realizing three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation and an automated one-dragon flow operation line for earthwork. The average work efficiency increased by more than seven times; more than 200 people replaced the work of more than 4,000 people, the construction period was shortened by 13 months, and the cost was greatly reduced, ensuring the quality.
    The Xinluo Village road construction project was undertaken by more than 4,000 new workers who had just put down their hoes and joined the railway construction. At the beginning, they were only used to shoulder carrying. Seeing such a large project, they said: "Such a large project, who knows when it will be filled up!" They lacked confidence in completing the project on schedule. According to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the Party organization at the construction site, on the one hand, carried out education on the General Line for everyone, and on the other hand, organized workers to visit other construction sites, invited veteran workers to give demonstrations, and opened training classes in the team. After the masses understood the principle of high-speed railway construction, they generated great material strength. When the Party organization called on everyone to "eliminate shoulder carrying," the workers immediately proposed the guarantee of "hard work to push down the mountain, drilling to break through the sky, hard work for 15 days, and eliminate carrying poles," and as a result, small machines such as chicken carts and skateboards were fully implemented in a few days, and the carrying poles were sent back to the material warehouse with gongs and drums. The workers were not satisfied with this. They proposed the suggestion of making large boxcars that could carry more than two cubic meters of soil. At this time, some cadres' ideas of believing in foreign things and not in local things came to the fore, saying, "It's about the same for new workers to be able to do this. There are no steel rails, so what are you doing with large boxcars!" The Party organization firmly supported the workers' suggestion and called on everyone: "If we are poor, we will work! If we don't know, we will learn! If we don't have foreign equipment, we will make local equipment!" The workers also put forward the heroic slogan of "Difficulties are afraid of tough guys, difficulties deceive weaklings. Even if there are thousands of difficulties, they cannot withstand hard work." After hard work and clever work, they finally successfully trial-produced large boxcars that were almost as big as trucks. However, when the car was tested for the first time, the axle was bent, and more than 20 people could not push it. Some technical cadres advocated: "Simply dismantle the large boxcar and apply to the bureau for a small train." The workers were not convinced and found the secretary to reason. The secretary resolutely stated: "Not only can it not be dismantled, but four more must be made!" He immediately convened a "three-in-one" meeting. After everyone's research, it was proposed to process two small axles to form one large axle, and use the triangular iron of the tent frame to replace the small steel rails on the wooden rails, which solved this key problem. Later, the large boxcar was changed to an automatic unloading train, and the local machinery exerted almost the same power as the small train. The comrades who originally opposed this method could not help but be convinced.
    The appearance of large boxcars brought new topics to other processes such as loading, spreading, and ramming. It required each process to keep up accordingly and realize comprehensive rapid construction. At the same time, the successful creation of large boxcars further stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to "cross the silver bridge and walk the golden bridge" and leap from one stage to another new stage. The enthusiasm of the masses became more and more boosted. Under the leadership and specific help of the higher-level Party committee, the brigade Party committee established a "three-in-one" technological innovation research group; fully mobilized and relied on the masses to compile a construction organization design for the entire work site to carry out rapid construction, and formulated an overall plan for comprehensively carrying out technological innovation. Cadres at all levels insisted on attacking key points and following-up labor on a one-dragon basis, and widely organized one-dragon competitions between various processes, track competitions between trains, team competitions, skilled worker competitions, technical performance competitions, etc., further setting off a vigorous mass technological innovation and technological revolution upsurge. Advanced tools such as automatic shuttle trough funnel loading, small funnel group spreading soil, and various single-person ramming machines appeared in various processes such as excavation, loading, transportation, unloading, spreading, and ramming. Advanced construction methods such as layered excavation, embankment bridge construction, and multi-faceted soil removal were adopted in accordance with local conditions, forming three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operations on the narrow construction site. The labor organization was adjusted in a timely and reasonable manner, and fixed points, fixed personnel, and fixed responsibilities were implemented for each process. A command platform was set up at the work site, and division cadres took turns serving as dispatchers to unify command. In this way, advanced production tools, advanced construction methods, and reasonable labor organization were closely combined in the rapid construction organization design of the work site, and an automated one-dragon flow operation line for earthwork was established, which greatly simplified the operation process and made the small machinery comprehensively linked.
    The great era is blooming with endless flowers of wisdom from the working masses everywhere. The workers of Xinluo Village became more and more energetic as they worked, and they dared to think more and more. With their red hearts and skillful hands, they created small excavators, electric tractors, and road rollers before the successful completion of the project, setting a brilliant example of rapid construction for the railway infrastructure departments in our province. Under the leadership of the Party, the whole province launched a vigorous "Xinluo Village" movement. This movement won time and achieved great results. The average labor productivity of railway construction units throughout the province in the fourth quarter of last year increased by two and a half times compared with the first quarter of last year, saving a lot of labor. The Sichuan-Guizhou line alone saved more than 30,000 people, and quickly developed from earthwork projects to a mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement involving multiple types of work and multiple aspects. The Liangfengya Tunnel created a record of 340.85 meters of monthly tunneling and 51.57 meters of daily tunneling in November last year. In the first quarter of this year, the Qinxi River and Xiaogangou Bridges created the achievement of completing the main structure of the bridge in more than 16 days and 12 and a half days respectively, and the road maintenance work was fully realized semi-mechanization.
    From the practice of the Xinluo Village construction site, I have further realized the unparalleled wisdom and endless creativity of the working masses; vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution by using both foreign and local methods and self-reliance can not only transform manual operation into semi-mechanized and mechanized operation, greatly improve technical equipment conditions, and greatly improve labor productivity, but also continuously improve the efficiency of these machines and continuously develop from low to high. Building railways at a higher speed to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national economy is the glorious responsibility of our railway employees. We are determined to continue to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution under the leadership of the Party, accelerate the speed of railway construction, ensure the completion and over-completion of the national construction plan, and quickly build the railways in the mountainous areas of Guizhou to be accessible in all directions, and strive to realize the high-speed development of the national economy!

    实干巧干推倒了大山
    工人们说：穷，就干！干劲推倒山，钻劲钻破天。只要干，就不怕难；困难怕硬汉，那怕千难万难，抵不住巧干！
    刘建熙代表谈川黔路快速施工的经过各位代表：
  我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。现在我就贵州省铁路建设情况发表一点意见。
    贵州的铁路建设在去年黔桂铁路通车到贵阳以来，正在加速的向前发展。目前，川黔、滇黔、湘黔铁路正在加紧施工，许多支线和厂矿专用线正在分批修筑，一个新兴的铁路网的前景已经展现在我们的面前。贵州各族人民多年来的愿望即将变成现实。是我省各族人民在党中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，在总路线光辉照耀下，大搞铁路建设的巨大成就。
    在贵州山区修筑铁路，常常会遇到一些过去所不曾碰到过的新问题：地形地质复杂，桥梁隧道多，隧道里溶洞多，地下水汹涌，有时甚至还要在隧道里纵横修桥；土石方数量大，平均每公里最高达十八至二十五万立方米，个别的一百米线路达到七万四千多立方米，线路在深山峡谷中迂回，到处是悬岩峭壁，劳动力不能大量使用等等。这些都给铁路的修筑带来许多不便，而最初的施工方法又大都采用人力挑抬，工效很低。1959年上半年多数施工单位的土石方综合平均工效，每工天只有一点八立方米。显然，这与铁路建设事业发展的需要是不相适应的。在党的八届八中全会的巨大鼓舞下，去年全省铁路职工反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了大闹技术革新和技术革命的高潮，在这个高潮中，出现了新萝村快速施工工点，就大大的加快了建设的速度。
    新萝村是川黔铁路贵阳到息烽之间的关键工程之一。这个工点，中部是座大山，两头都是深沟。根据施工要求，要把中部大山削掉大半，填平两头的深沟，有的地方要深挖二十六米，有的地方又要填高二十三米，需要挖填的土石方总数达六十多万立方米。这样庞大的工程，却集中在一个长仅一千一百多米、半径三百米的灯泡形的弯道上，工作量大，工作面小，施工困难。但是，新萝村工地的职工，没有被困难吓倒，在党的领导下，他们大闹技术革新和技术革命运动，自力更生、因地制宜地创造和使用了五类三十二种、三百二十件小型机械，不仅消灭了肩挑背背，而且在二百五十多米长、五十多米高的工地里，分三层同时操作，实现了立体交叉平行流水作业和土的一条龙自动化流水作业线，平均工效提高七倍多；二百多人就代替了原来四千多人的工作，工期提前十三个月，并大大地降低了成本，保证了质量。
    担负新萝村筑路工程的是刚放下锄头、投入铁路建设的四千多名新工人，开初他们都只习惯肩挑背背，看见这么大的工程，就说：“这么大的工程，晓得要啥时候才填得起来啊！”对按期完工，缺乏信心。工地党组织根据上级党委的指示，针对这一情况，一面向大家进行总路线的教育，一面组织工人到别的工地参观，请老工人来作示范表演，并在队上开办了训练班。群众懂得了高速度建设铁路的道理后，便产生巨大的物质力量。当党组织号召大家“消灭肩挑背背”，工人们就马上提出“干劲推倒山，钻劲冲破天，苦战十五天，扁担杠子消灭完”的保证，结果在几天之内就全面推行了鸡公车、滑板等小型机具，敲锣打鼓的把扁担杠子送回了材料库。工人们并不以此为满足，他们提出搞能装运两方多土的大箱车的建议。这时，有的干部信洋不信土的思想露头了，说什么“新工人能搞到这个样子就差不多了，连钢轨都没有，还搞什么大箱车！”党组织坚决地支持工人的建议，号召大家：“穷，就干！不会，就学！没有洋设备就搞土的！”工人们也提出“困难怕硬汉，困难欺软蛋，那怕千难万难，抵不住一干”的英雄口号，经过苦干、巧干，终于试制成功了差不多卡车那样大的大箱车。可是第一次试车时，车轴被压弯了，二十多人也推不动。有的技术干部主张：“干脆把大箱车拆掉，向局里申请小火车”，工人们不服气，找到书记来评理，书记坚决表示：“不但不能拆，还要再作四部！”他马上召集了“三结合”会议，经过大家研究，提出了以两根小轴加工组成一根大轴，用帐蓬架子的三角铁安在木轨上代替小钢轨的建议，解决了这一关键问题。以后，又把大箱车改为自动卸土列车，土机械发挥了和小火车差不多的威力。原来反对这样办的同志，也不能不口服心服了。
    大箱车的出现，给装、撒、夯等其他工序带来了新的课题，它要求各工序都相应地跟上来，实现全面的快速施工。同时，大箱车的创制成功，进一步激发了群众“过了银桥走金桥”、从一个阶段跃向另一个新的阶段的革命热情，群众干劲越鼓越足。大队党委在上级党委的领导和具体帮助下，建立了“三结合”的技术革新研究小组；充分发动并依靠群众编制了整个工点开展快速施工的施工组织设计，制定了全面进行技术革新的总体规划。各级干部都坚持了攻关键和一条龙的跟班劳动，广泛组织了各工序之间的一条龙竞赛，列车之间的对口赛、班组赛、能手赛、技术表演赛等等，进一步掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革新和技术革命热潮。在挖、装、运、卸、撒、夯等各个工序上出现了自动梭槽漏斗装车，小漏斗群撒土和各种单人打夯机等先进工具，因地制宜地采用了分层开挖、筑埂架桥、多面出土等先进的施工方法，在狭窄的工地上形成了立体交叉平行流水作业。及时合理地调整了劳动组织，对各工序实行定点、定人、定职责，工点上设立指挥台，由分队干部轮流担任调度，统一指挥，这样就在工点的快速施工组织设计中把先进的生产工具、先进的施工方法和合理的劳动组织密切结合起来，建立了土的一条龙自动化流水作业线，大大简化了作业过程，使小型机械综合联动化。
    伟大的时代，到处开放着工人群众无穷无尽的智慧的花朵。新萝村的工人们越干越有劲，越想越敢想，凭着他们的红心巧手，在胜利完工之前又创制成功了小型挖土机、电力牵引车和压路机等机械，为我省铁路基建部门树立了快速施工的光辉榜样。在党的领导下，全省开展了一个轰轰烈烈的“新萝村”运动。这个运动，争得了时间，收到了巨大的效果。全省铁路施工单位去年第四季度的平均劳动生产率，比去年第一季度提高了两倍半，节约了大量的劳动力，其中仅川黔线就节约了三万多人，并很快地由土石方工程发展成为多工种、多方面的群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。凉风垭隧道于去年11月创造了月成洞三百四十点八五米、日成洞五十一点五七米的纪录，今年一季度秦溪河和小干沟大桥分别创造了十六天多和十二天半完成大桥主体工程的成绩，养路工作全部实现了半机械化。
    从新萝村工地的实践中，使我进一步地认识到工人群众的无比智慧和无穷尽的创造力；用洋土并举、自力更生的办法大搞技术革新和技术革命，不仅能够把手工操作变成半机械化、机械化操作，大大改善技术设备条件，大大提高劳动生产率，而且能够不断提高这些机具的效能，由低到高地不断向前发展。用更高的速度建设铁路，以适应国民经济高速度发展的需要，是我们铁路员工的光荣职责，我们决心在党的领导下，继续大搞技术革新和技术革命，加快铁路建设速度，保证完成和超额完成国家建设计划，把贵州山区的铁路迅速修得四通八达，为实现国民经济高速度的发展而奋斗！
    以上发言，不当之处，请各位代表指正。
