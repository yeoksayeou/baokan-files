    The Spring of Hungary
    Sun Yong
    On this great holiday of freedom,
    I remember her fifteen years:
    Fifteen years of arduous creation,
    Fifteen years of struggle and development.
    She has just stepped into the sixties,
    New things shake the earth and sky;
    The spring of Hungary has arrived again,
    I want to sing joyful poems:
    Hundreds of birds sing by the Danube River,
    Beautiful spring scenery fills the workshops,
    Technological innovation blossoms in competition,
    Red flags of competition reflect the blue sky.
    Heroic figures are counted today,
    Mutual assistance and cooperation take up the battle,
    Everyone praises the "labor team,"
    The communist style is high!
    A spring breeze reaches the farmer's home overnight,
    Thousands of villages and households are collectivized,
    The socialist future is bright,
    The reddest is still the "collective" flower!
    Thousands of miles of fields are full of spring,
    Everywhere is busy with spring plowing and sowing,
    Carrying the sun and chasing the stars and moon,
    Strive for a good harvest and produce more grain.
    This is the spring of Hungary,
    The beautiful life is brilliant.
    I am standing by the Danube River again,
    I hear joyful shouts.
    In the first year of the sixties,
    On this day of the fifteenth anniversary of liberation,
    I want to be with her people,
    Singing the song of praise in unison!

    匈牙利的春天
    孙用
    在这伟大的自由节日，
    我记起了她的十五年：
    十五年前的艰难缔造，
    十五年来的奋斗、发展。
    她刚跨进了六十年代，
    新生的事物动地惊天；
    匈牙利的春天又到了，
    我要高唱欢乐的诗篇：
    多瑙河畔百鸟喧，
    绮丽春色满车间，
    技术革新花竞放，
    竞赛红旗映蓝天。
    英雄人物数今朝，
    互助协作把战挑，
    人人争夸“劳动队”，
    共产主义风格高！
    一夜春风到农家，
    千村万户合作化，
    社会主义前程好，
    最红还是“集体”花！
    千里田野遍春光，
    处处春耕春播忙，
    担起太阳赶星月，
    争取丰收多打粮。
    这就是匈牙利的春天，
    美好的生活光辉灿烂。
    我又站在多瑙河边了，
    我听到了欢乐的呼喊。
    在六十年代的第一年，
    解放十五周年这一天，
    我要和她的人民一起，
    同声高唱歌颂的诗篇！
