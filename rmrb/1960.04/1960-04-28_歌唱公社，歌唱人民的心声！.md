    Sing the Praises of the Commune, Sing the Heartfelt Voice of the People!

    The vigorous development of the urban people's commune movement is the demand of the broad urban working residents, the inevitable product of historical development, and an event of great historical significance. In this climax of the urban people's commune movement, Beijing's literary and art workers have brought into play the glorious fighting tradition of our country's revolutionary literature and art closely cooperating with the revolutionary movement. In a short period of time, they have created a large number of works with high ideological and artistic qualities, which have been praised and commended by the broad masses. This is another concrete example of the victory of the brilliant Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. The students and young teachers of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music also created 114 songs in two weeks, of which 41 outstanding songs have been circulated among the masses and published by Beijing Publishing House and Music Publishing House, and broadcasted on the radio.
    Long before the arrival of the urban people's commune movement, the students of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music organized a group to go to the Erlonglu People's Commune, one of the earliest urban people's communes established in Beijing. Their creation, "Erlonglu Serenade," immediately spread from the Erlonglu People's Commune to the Shijingshan People's Commune and the Chunshu People's Commune. "Look at the two dragons playing with the pearl, soaring and flying, flying to the sky!" This popular language and simple tune sang the heartfelt voice of the broad urban working people. Every time the students of the affiliated middle school of the Central Conservatory of Music sang the line "Sister Zhang, Aunt Li, leave the kitchen and go out, happily go to work," it always caused countless Sister Zhangs and Aunt Lis to burst into laughter. No wonder the "Erlonglu is a good place" in this song was changed to "Shijingshan is a good place" and "Chunshu Hutong is a good place" and sung everywhere. In this way, the students created the first batch of works praising the urban people's commune, such as "Zhang Xiulan Enters the Factory" and "Singing the Chunshu People's Commune."
    With the advent of the urban people's commune movement, the students of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, led by young teachers such as Wang Zhenya, launched a creative activity. At the celebration meeting for the establishment of the people's commune, the students sang the celebration song "Urban People's Commune is Established." This song initially used the锣鼓 (gong and drum) rhythm as an introduction, combined with the melody of northern plateau folk songs, singing the joyful and excited mood. "Communism is paradise, the people's commune is the bridge, every household has no idle people, factories are set up in every street and alley." This song, with its varied rhythm and melodious tune, was quickly accepted and loved by the masses. The high-pitched singing of "Celebratory songs soar into the clouds...the urban commune is established!" in the coda truly makes this song a passionate ode.
    "Happiness Flowers Bloom Everywhere" is different from "Erlonglu Serenade." It is not in the style of storytelling and singing, but uses the rhythm of four sixteenth notes per beat to run through the whole song, gaining a joyful mood. In terms of melody, it maintains a circumambulation of the tonic and dominant, seeking unity in change. "Happiness flowers bloom everywhere, urban communes are set up, thousands of households gather together, not separated by wind and rain!" This simple and unpretentious language sings the most sincere feelings of the people.
    This concentrated creative activity proves that the fallacy that songs that cooperate with mass movements cannot achieve high artistic quality has been completely and thoroughly bankrupted in the face of facts. The students went deep into life, created songs with certain ideological and artistic qualities, closely cooperated with political tasks, and received warm praise and welcome from the broad masses.
    Creative practice also raises new questions for us: Can the old style and old framework of the form and melody of mass songs be further broken through? Thus, on the basis of inheriting the revolutionary mass songs since Nie Er, can we carry out bold creation and innovation. In summarizing this creation, some people suggested: Mass songs have had many attempts in using the style of storytelling and singing, but opera music is more popular among the broad masses. Can mass songs use the melody of opera and also refer more to the tune form of the Banqiang body in form? This is indeed a question worth serious discussion.

    歌唱公社，歌唱人民的心声！
    赵沨
    城市人民公社运动蓬勃地展开，这是广大城市劳动居民的要求，是历史发展的必然产物，是具有伟大历史意义的事件。北京的文学艺术工作者在这个城市人民公社运动的高潮中，发挥了我国革命文艺的紧密配合革命运动的光荣战斗传统，在短短的时间内，创作了一大批具有较高的思想性和艺术性的作品，受到广大群众的称赞和表扬，这是光辉的毛泽东文艺思想又一胜利的具体例证。中央音乐学院作曲系的学生和青年教师，在两周内也创作歌曲一百一十四首，其中较优秀的四十一首已经在群众中流传，并由北京出版社、音乐出版社出版，在电台播唱。
    早在城市人民公社运动到来之前，中央音乐学院作曲系的学生们便组织一个小组，到北京市创办最早的城市人民公社之一的二龙路人民公社去，他们创作的“二龙路小唱”，一下子便从二龙路人民公社流传到石景山人民公社和椿树人民公社。“你看那二龙戏珠展翘飞，飞呵飞呀飞天上！”这通俗的语言、朴素的音调唱出了广大城市劳动人民的心声。每次当中央音乐学院附属中学的学生们唱到“张二嫂，李大娘，离开锅台走出家，欢欢喜喜把工上”这一句时，总是引起无数的张二嫂和李大娘们放声大笑。难怪这首歌的“二龙路好地方”被改为“石景山好地方”和“椿树胡同好地方”而到处演唱了。学生们就这样创作了“张秀兰进工厂”、“歌唱椿树人民公社”等第一批歌颂城市人民公社的作品。
    城市人民公社的运动到来了，中央音乐学院作曲系的学生们在青年教师王震亚等率领下，展开了创作活动，在庆祝人民公社成立大会上，学生们高唱了庆祝歌“城市人民公社成立了”。这首歌曲一开始用锣鼓节奏作为引子，结合着北方高原民歌的音调，唱出了欢欣鼓舞的情绪。“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁，家家户户无闲人，大街小巷办工厂”。这首节奏富有变化、曲调流畅动听的歌曲一下子便为群众所接受、喜爱，在尾声中高唱“庆祝歌声冲云霄……城市公社成立了！”使这首歌曲真正成为一首热情的颂歌。
    “幸福花儿遍地开”和“二龙路小唱”不同，这不是说唱的风格，而是用四个十六分音符一拍的节奏来贯串全曲，获得一种喜气洋洋的情绪，在音调上保持环绕主音和属音进行，变化中求得统一。“幸福花儿遍地开，城市公社办起来，千家万户聚一堂，风吹雨打不分开！”这朴实无华的语言唱出了人们的最真挚的感情。
    从这一次突击的创作活动中证明，说什么配合群众运动的歌曲是不可能获得较高的艺术性的这种谬论，在事实面前完全、彻底地破产了。学生们深入生活，创作了具有一定思想性和艺术性的歌曲，密切地配合了政治任务，受到了广大群众的热烈称赞和欢迎。
    创作实践也为我们提出新的课题：群众歌曲的形式、音调的旧格调、旧框框能不能进一步突破？从而在继承聂耳以来的革命群众歌曲的基础上，进行大胆地创造和革新。在总结这次创作时，有人便提出：群众歌曲在利用说唱风格上已经有了许多尝试，但戏曲音乐更为广大群众所喜好，群众歌曲能否利用戏曲的音调、并在形式上也更多地参考板腔体的曲式呢？这的确是一个值得认真讨论的问题。
