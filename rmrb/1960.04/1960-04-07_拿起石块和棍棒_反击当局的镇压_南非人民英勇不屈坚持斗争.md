Xinhua News Agency, Cape Town, 6th Dispatch: The struggle of Africans against racial discrimination and for basic human rights continued to surge across South Africa on the 5th. Africans, prohibited by law from possessing knives and guns, took up stones and sticks to resist the bloody suppression by the authorities.

    In Nyanga, near Cape Town, the "stay-at-home" strike movement launched by African workers has continued for several days. On the 5th, the South African government used troops and armored vehicles to support a large number of police, armed to the teeth, who stormed into the town to conduct searches, attempting to use force to compel the workers to return to work. It was reported that after the police arrived in the town, they arbitrarily beat and shot Africans. They even broke down doors and windows, dragging Africans from their homes into the streets to beat them. Pregnant women and children were not spared. At least eighty-four black people were injured, many of whom were drenched in the pouring rain after being injured. Angry Africans were determined and resolute in their struggle, rising up to resist and killing a policeman. Even a local police officer had to admit that the town was "full of resisting people who were not going to work."

    In Lamontville, ten miles from Durban, another thousand Africans clashed with police who came to suppress them on the evening of the 5th. On the previous night, two thousand Africans in the town had repelled the police provocation with stones and sticks. At the Smith workers' dormitory near Lamontville, hundreds of African workers, regardless of the military and police blockade, rushed out of the dormitory gates, determined not to work anymore. In Walmer and other places near Port Elizabeth, groups of African youths also held demonstrations in African residential areas on the evening of the 5th.

    In various African towns near Durban, batches of Africans were arrested by the police on "charges" of "inciting riots" or burning "passes." On the 4th, at the colonial court in Paarl, thirty miles from Cape Town, an African man was sentenced to four months in prison and a fine of seventy-five pounds, and an African woman was sentenced to three months in prison and a fine of fifty pounds on the "charge" of burning "passes."

    While dispatching military police for armed suppression and using colonial courts to impose heavy sentences on Africans, the South African authorities also hurriedly passed the "Unlawful Organizations Bill" in the Federal Parliament on the 5th, attempting to ban the activities of all African nationalist organizations.

    The South African government also announced in a communiqué on the 5th that the South African progressive publications "New Age" Weekly and "Torch" Newspaper had been banned from publication.

    拿起石块和棍棒　反击当局的镇压
    南非人民英勇不屈坚持斗争
    据新华社6日讯　开普敦消息：非洲人反对种族歧视、争取基本人权的斗争，5日仍在南非全国各地汹涌进行。被法律禁止持有刀枪的非洲人，拿起石块和棍棒反抗当局的血腥镇压。
    在开普敦附近的尼安加，非洲工人展开的“留在家里”的罢工运动已经持续了好几天。5日，南非政府用军队和装甲车支持大批警察荷枪实弹冲入这个市镇进行搜捕，企图用武力迫使工人复工。据报道，警察开到这个市镇以后，任意殴打和枪击非洲人。他们甚至打破门窗，把非洲人从家里拖到街上来殴打，孕妇和小孩也未能幸免。至少有八十四个黑人受伤。其中许多人在受伤后还在倾盆大雨中受淋。愤怒的非洲人斗志坚决，奋起反抗，打死了一名警察。连当地的一名警官也不得不承认，在这个市镇里“满是反抗的不上工的人”。
    在距德班十英里的拉蒙特维尔，5日晚上又有一千名非洲人同前来镇压的警察发生冲突。在头一天晚上，这个市镇上的两千名非洲人就曾经以石块和棍棒击退了警察的挑衅。在拉蒙特维尔附近的史密斯工人宿舍，数以百计的非洲工人不顾军警的封锁，冲出了宿舍大门，决心不再上工。在伊丽莎白港附近瓦尔默等地，成群的非洲青年5日晚上也在非洲人居住区举行示威。
    在德班附近各非洲人市镇，成批的非洲人被警察以“煽动暴乱”或焚烧“通行证”的“罪名”逮捕。4日，在距开普敦三十英里巴尔地方的殖民法院，以焚烧“通行证”的“罪名”判处一名非洲男人四个月徒刑和七十五镑罚款，判处一名非洲妇女三个月徒刑和五十镑罚款。
    南非当局在出动军警进行武装镇压、利用殖民法庭判处非洲人重刑的同时，5日还在联邦议会匆忙通过了“非法组织法案”，企图禁止一切非洲人民族主义组织的活动。
    南非政府5日还在一项公报中宣布，南非的进步刊物“新世纪”周报和“火炬报”已被禁止出版。
