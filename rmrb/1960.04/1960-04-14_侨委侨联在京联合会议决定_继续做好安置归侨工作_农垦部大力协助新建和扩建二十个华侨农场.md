Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Beijing and the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese jointly held a meeting in Beijing on the 12th. Relevant responsible persons from the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China reported on the situation of receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese in the first quarter of this year.

The meeting was attended by Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Vice Chairmen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, You Yangzu and Wang Yuanxing, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, as well as Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyuan, Shao Lizi, and other members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and standing committee members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in Beijing, totaling forty-nine people. Wang Zhen, Deputy Chairman of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Minister of State Farms and Land Reclamation, also attended the meeting.

The relevant responsible person of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese reported that more than 10,000 returned Overseas Chinese who came back to the motherland in the first quarter of this year have been properly resettled. Various departments of the central and local governments have enthusiastically supported the work of receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese. In the first quarter alone, various materials allocated for receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese amounted to more than 400 tons. The vast majority of returned Overseas Chinese have been resettled in state-owned Overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places, and some have settled in industrial and mining enterprises or rural people's communes. After arriving at their resettlement locations, they quickly and happily threw themselves into labor production, and returned Overseas Chinese students also enrolled in schools to study.

Members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and standing committee members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese expressed satisfaction with the work of receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese in their speeches. They pointed out that since the anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities in Indonesia have not stopped, the number of Overseas Chinese returning to the country to participate in socialist construction will continue to increase. Therefore, we must continue to vigorously prepare for receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese.

Wang Zhen, Minister of State Farms and Land Reclamation, made a speech on the issue of developing state-owned farms and doing a good job in receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese. He said that the State Farms and Land Reclamation departments warmly welcome Overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in construction, and will vigorously assist the Overseas Chinese affairs departments in doing a good job in building and expanding twenty state-owned Overseas Chinese farms this year in order to welcome more returned Overseas Chinese to return to the motherland to participate in construction.

The meeting also decided to organize a work group including members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese affairs cadres to go to various ports receiving returned Overseas Chinese and state-owned Overseas Chinese farms in the near future to inspect the work of receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese.

    新华社13日讯　华侨事务委员会在京委员和中华全国归国华侨联合会常务委员会12日在北京联合举行会议，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会有关负责人在会上报告了今年第一季度接待和安置归国华侨的情况。
    出席会议的有华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄希泉、黄长水、庄明理，全国侨联副主席尤扬祖、王源兴以及在京的华侨事务委员会委员、全国侨联常务委员蔡廷锴、陈其瑗、邵力子等四十九人。中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员、农垦部部长王震也出席了会议。
    接待和安置归国华侨委员会有关负责人报告说，今年第一季度回到祖国的一万多名归侨，都已得到妥善安置。中央和地方的各个部门都热情地支持接待和安置归侨的工作，仅第一季度为接待安置归侨调拨的各项物资即达四百多吨。归侨们绝大部分安置在广东、福建、广西、云南等地的国营华侨农场，还有一部分在工矿企业或农村人民公社中安家落户。他们到达安置地点以后，就迅速地、愉快地投入了劳动生产，归国华侨学生也入校学习。
    华侨事务委员会的委员和全国侨联的常务委员们在发言中对接待和安置归国华侨的工作表示满意。他们指出，由于印度尼西亚的反华、排华活动并没有停止，华侨回国参加社会主义建设的将日益增多，因此，必须继续大力做好接待安置归侨的准备工作。
    农垦部部长王震就发展国营农场、做好接待和安置归侨工作问题作了发言。他说，农垦部门热烈欢迎海外华侨回国参加建设，并将大力协助侨务部门做好在今年内新建和扩建二十个国营华侨农场的工作，以便迎接更多的归侨回到祖国来参加建设。
    会议还决定要在最近组织包括华侨事务委员会委员、全国侨联委员和侨务干部的工作组，到各接待归侨的口岸和国营华侨农场，检查接待和安置归国华侨的工作。
