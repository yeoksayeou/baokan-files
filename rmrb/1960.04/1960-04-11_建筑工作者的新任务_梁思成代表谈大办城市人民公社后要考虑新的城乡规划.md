New Tasks for Construction Workers

Liang Sicheng, Representative, Discusses New Urban and Rural Planning After the Large-Scale Establishment of Urban People's Communes

Our urban and rural construction is carried out in accordance with certain plans and in a planned manner in order to meet the needs of national economic construction. The further consolidation of rural people's communes and the large-scale establishment of urban people's communes require us not only to complete more urban and rural planning tasks, but also to solve many new problems. To properly solve these problems is the glorious task of our construction workers. Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. The reports of the three Vice Premiers are inspiring battle calls that invigorate our work. As a construction worker, I noted with incomparable excitement that the capital construction investment in the state budget is 32.5 billion yuan, accounting for about 46% of the total state expenditure. Adding the surplus from the previous year and the investment raised by local authorities, which is about 6 billion yuan, the total amount reaches about 38.5 billion yuan. In capital construction, about half of the expenses of general industrial enterprises are used for construction. Assuming this is roughly accurate, in 1960, about 19 billion yuan of funds will be spent by us construction workers. This makes us more concretely understand the sharp contrast between the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and the 1960 US government budget. Military expenditure accounts for 57.1% of the US budget, which is a budget for arms expansion and war preparations with swords drawn and fangs bared. And in our budget, capital construction investment alone accounts for about 45%, which powerfully demonstrates our "ardent desire to engage in peaceful labor and our firm determination to reduce state expenditure and accelerate socialist construction." This concrete understanding has given us greater encouragement and boosted our morale even higher. We construction workers resolutely respond to the call of the Party and the government, and we will definitely complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government more, faster, better, and more economically.

Our socialist construction is carried out in accordance with the national and local economic and cultural construction plans. The construction of each city, worker town, or people's commune must first rationally arrange the buildings needed for production and life in accordance with the requirements of the plan. That is the work of our urban and rural planning and construction. Now I would like to express some opinions on this.

In the past ten years, with the vigorous development of various construction undertakings, especially industrial construction, China's urban construction has also developed rapidly. According to statistics, we have carried out construction work of varying degrees in more than 2,100 towns and cities; among them, 167 towns and cities were completely newly built from scratch; 124 cities were expanded and rebuilt on a large scale. Due to the large-scale construction, reconstruction and expansion work, the distribution of cities in our country, the economic structure of old cities, the internal layout and the appearance of cities have undergone great changes, and the urban population has more than doubled compared with the pre-liberation figure of more than 40 million. The building area of many cities has increased several times or dozens of times. China's urban construction has traversed the road of hundreds or even thousands of years in history within ten years.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward of 1958 opened a new stage in China's socialist construction. Various undertakings in our country have developed more vigorously, and construction is in full swing everywhere. The continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy, especially the needs of the great development of industrial construction, have prompted China's urban construction to run forward at a rapid pace. Our cities are developing and building at an unprecedented high speed and on an unprecedented scale. According to preliminary statistics, in the past two years, the area of factories, residences and public buildings built in towns and cities has reached more than 290 million square meters. For example, if calculated according to the existing building area of Shanghai, we have built three or even four large Shanghais in just two years. Many new industrial bases are under large-scale construction. New cities are rapidly forming. The reconstruction work of many large and medium-sized cities, provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals is proceeding in a planned manner. The large-scale reconstruction of the capital is in full swing; the Ten Great Construction Projects are a clear example. Tiananmen Square and Chang'an Street in the capital, Minhang Street in Shanghai, and Bayi Avenue in Nanchang all show the new face of socialist cities with their magnificent momentum and beautiful style. While urban construction is developing rapidly, rural people's communes have also carried out a large number of new rural construction projects. Shangzhuang People's Commune in Xushui, Hebei, Xinhua People's Commune in Huaxian, Guangdong, Changzheng People's Commune in Shanghai, Jinniu People's Commune in Chengdu, Sichuan, etc., have all built the first batch of new villages at a rapid speed. The commune members happily moved into new houses with sufficient sunshine, cleanliness and beauty, which even urban residents could not live in in the past. Our cities and villages are developing towards the direction of modernization and landscaping. This is very exciting, and as a construction worker, I am especially pleased and encouraged.

Our urban and rural construction is carried out in accordance with the needs of the national economic construction and according to certain plans. Urban and rural planning and regional planning have also been greatly developed. Since 1958, urban planning in the country has been popularized from key cities to all cities. More than 180 cities with city status have overall plans of varying depths. We have carried out planning for many county towns and new worker towns. Among the more than 1,700 county towns in the country, about two-thirds have rough plans. This ensures the relatively reasonable arrangement of various construction projects in the city, especially a large number of industrial construction projects, and the relatively reasonable layout of the entire city, so that the various parts of the city are organically combined, and the near and long term are mutually coordinated.

In order to adapt to the development of rural people's communes, all localities have implemented the instructions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on "gradually transforming existing old-style houses and building new-type garden-style townships and village settlements in stages and in batches," and have carried out pilot projects for the construction planning of rural people's commune residential areas, and have gained preliminary experience.

Regional planning is also being vigorously carried out. As far as I know, more than 40 regions across the country are conducting preliminary planning arrangements, and are beginning to carry out strategic deployments for industry, agriculture, transportation, water conservancy, electricity, towns, and residential areas.

The tremendous achievements made in urban and rural planning and construction in the country in such a short period of time are indeed an astonishing miracle. This can only happen in a socialist country like ours. This is the result of following the mass line under the leadership of the Party, and it is also the result of the continuous ideological revolution and technical revolution of all urban and rural planning and construction workers.

The National Urban Planning Work Symposium convened by the Ministry of Construction Engineering in Qingdao in June 1958 played a great role in promoting the great development of urban and rural planning in the country. According to the requirements of the general line and the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, it proposed the guidelines, tasks, and the direction of gradually realizing the modernization of cities from the actual situation, and pushed urban planning to a new stage of comprehensive development. The symposium emphasized the leadership of the Party committee, putting politics in command, launching mass movements, advocating the emancipation of the mind, breaking superstitions, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Therefore, it promoted a big step forward in urban planning work. In the past few years, the thinking of urban planning workers has experienced a process of breaking and establishing in practical work. That is: breaking the mysterious view that only a few people can do planning, establishing the idea of Party leadership, putting politics in command, relying on the masses, and collaborating with various departments to do planning; breaking unreasonable rules and regulations, establishing simple and easy-to-implement planning methods; breaking the practice of emphasizing long-term planning and neglecting short-term planning, establishing the practice of combining near and far term, with short-term planning as the main focus; breaking the practice of insisting on following a certain procedure regardless of the size of the city, or the degree of urgency, and establishing a planning method that goes from rough to detailed, from rough to fine, and gradually deepens. This set of breaking and establishing has greatly improved the political and ideological level and professional and technical level of urban planning cadres, and created a planning method of the mass line suitable for China's conditions. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement with rapid and high quality as the center, which is being carried out in the planning and design department, has achieved remarkable results. The technical work of planning and design has initially realized the manualization of data, the charting of calculations, the modeling of designs, and the mechanization and semi-mechanization of drawing tools. Some of them are also fully integrated. Because of relying on the leadership of the Party, the planning method of the mass line, coupled with a series of ideological revolutions and technical revolutions, has greatly shortened the time for urban planning. The regional planning of Chaoyang area in Liaoning, such a complex work, was basically completed in just two months due to the leadership of the Party committee, the secretary taking the lead, the large-scale mass line, and large-scale communist collaboration. The urban planning that has been done, except for some large and medium-sized cities, which are generally done in more depth and detail, other cities are generally rougher. However, it has also basically adapted to the needs of construction, and has initially arranged various construction projects, and these plans are still being continuously enriched, improved, deepened and refined.

The continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the continuous forward development of socialist construction always present us with new tasks and new problems that need to be solved. 1960 is the first year of the last three years of China's Second Five-Year Plan. According to the requirements of the draft national economic plan, the scale of the country's industrial and agricultural production and capital construction will increase greatly. The further consolidation and development of rural people's communes and the large-scale establishment of urban people's communes require us not only to complete new and more urban and rural planning tasks, but also to solve many new problems. To correctly solve these problems is also a brand-new and glorious task for us construction workers. There are many such problems, and here I can only talk about a few main aspects.

The Party and the government's prescribed policy of China's urban development will be a combination of large, medium and small, with the development of small and medium-sized cities as the main focus, which is completely correct. This policy is in line with the situation of industrial construction blooming everywhere, which is conducive to the rational distribution of productive forces, accelerating the elimination of urban-rural differences, and promoting the development and change of cities. The Qingdao Urban Planning Work Symposium of the Ministry of Construction Engineering proposed that large cities should establish satellite towns in a planned manner, and that from the actual situation, the gradual development of cities in our country towards modernization must be based on the current economic conditions of our country, and all construction undertakings in cities must be carried out diligently and frugally. Judging from the actual situation in the past few years, I personally think it is also very appropriate. It is not only conducive to production, but also conducive to the improvement of people's lives, making our towns and cities modern cities with a high degree of science and culture. We should strive to implement it.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "Now, cities across the country are vigorously establishing people's communes, vigorously establishing street industries, vigorously establishing suburban agriculture, vigorously establishing public welfare undertakings, vigorously establishing public canteens, and widely organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban people, and liberating thousands of urban housewives from housework and participating in social labor." How to carry out urban planning according to the requirements of the development of urban people's communes is a new problem facing construction workers. We should study it well. Socialist urban planning and construction in fact play the role of organizing the people's economy and life through the rational arrangement of factories, residences, public buildings, streets, green spaces, etc. Therefore, urban planning should consider further properly arranging street factories needed for housewives to participate in social labor and living welfare facilities such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens that serve all residents.

In addition to this, I think more importantly: the new ideas, new life, new problems, and new things of urban people's communes are unfamiliar to us in the past. We may not be so accustomed to this new way of life. How to transform our old ideas, old views, and old habits in this regard is an extremely important issue. We should study it, understand it; and only by participating in this movement in person can we deeply appreciate its greatness, correctness and far-reaching significance, and be pleased and encouraged by it. We must resolutely follow the Party and strive for the universal realization of urban people's communes under the leadership of the Party.

The socialist construction undertakings in our country are developing at such a high speed, and the reconstruction of old cities has also become a realistic problem. The tasks in terms of transforming municipal facilities, houses, residences, and the appearance of cities and realizing landscaping are still very heavy. Now, the reconstruction plans for the city center areas and streets that have begun or are being conceived in many large and medium-sized cities are a good start. We construction workers should play a greater active role in the process of rebuilding cities and create rich and colorful urban architectural appearances with distinctive characteristics.

The 1960 national economic plan determined "taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor," and called on "all departments to regard supporting agriculture as their important task." We construction workers should attach great importance to this issue. Our new countryside will not only be a countryside of modern agriculture, but also a new countryside with commune industry. The planning and construction of this new type of countryside is our important task in the future. Although we have carried out the planning of several people's communes for more than a year, our work is not enough. In the future, we should devote more effort and give more support, be with the masses, humbly listen to their opinions, and actively participate in the planning and construction of residential areas of rural people's communes. In addition to rationally deploying residences and a complete set of living welfare facilities, as well as cowsheds, pigsties, tractor and automobile stations, and various rural factories and workshops, we should also provide design drawings for these buildings and provide technical guidance, and cultivate rural planning and construction cadres and construction workers.

Combined with the issue of supporting agriculture and training cadres, here is an example to report on some of the work done by a university in this regard. In 1958, the Department of Architecture and the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University, together with the commune members of Dasigezhuang in Xushui, where Chairman Mao once visited, planned, designed and built a residential area. For more than a year, the production enthusiasm of the commune members has become even higher. They said: "Our village won the high-yield banner of Baoding Prefecture last year, and these buildings should also be credited." "Just based on the convenience of production and the happiness of the commune members living in buildings, our village's production will double again this year." Since then, Tsinghua University has taken root in Xushui. Recently, another group of more than 90 teachers and students responded to the call of the central government and went to Xushui. Under the leadership of the county party committee and the commune party committee, they worked with cadres at all levels and the broad masses to make a construction plan for the commune, solved the urgent tasks proposed by the realization of agricultural modernization, and arranged and determined the lines for the commune industry, tractor stations, machine-cultivated roads, hospital buildings, etc. that will be built soon. The teachers and students also combined with the local central propaganda task of realizing "thousands and millions" (thousands of catties of grain, hundreds of catties of cotton, and ten thousand catties of potatoes), drew a propaganda painting of one zhang and eight chi long, and compiled allegro poems to widely publicize in the fields and on the streets, vividly depicting the construction scene of the communist Shangzhuang, which greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the commune members, and the teachers and students themselves also received profound education. Because they combined political and ideological education with planning business in every link of the entire work process, and combined mass propaganda work with planning business work, everyone achieved a double harvest of ideology and business. This once again vividly proved the wisdom and correctness of the Party's "education serving proletarian politics and education combining with productive labor." A group of construction cadres who are both red and expert have grown up rapidly in the battle.

The technical revolution in urban and rural planning is continuing vigorously on the basis of the significant achievements that have been made. There has been great development in the organizational leadership, content and methods of planning. Continuously carrying out technical revolution is not only necessary to complete new and huge planning and construction tasks, but also indispensable to solve the new problems we face. Under the current situation of rapid development, it is not easy to report on technical innovations and technical revolutions in urban planning work here. Today's new things will be surpassed and compared by newer things tomorrow. But I still can't help but talk about what I know about the recent situation. For example, many planning departments have created fully integrated rapid planning and design methods and various instruments and tools, both indigenous and foreign. They have also created "several-izations and several-methods" in the planning process, such as design standardization, calculation charting electrification, drawing assembly-ization printing-ization, tool mechanization and semi-mechanization, data systemization, manualization, and modeling methods, table lookup methods, photography-ization, template methods, cut-and-paste methods, patchwork methods, roller methods, printing methods, etc. This movement is developing vigorously and deeply, and there is no doubt that at this moment, more new "izations," new "methods," new theories, and, more importantly, new ideas have already appeared.

Our urban planning and design workers have always been very hardworking and have made great achievements. However, I feel that the existing planning technical cadres in our country are still not many, much less than the technical personnel in any department. The strength of urban planning should be greatly developed; each province and major and medium-sized city should establish and develop its own planning and design institutions in order to adapt to the needs of large-scale urban construction. In addition to the relevant schools and planning departments actively, massively and rapidly cultivating cadres in this area, it is recommended that relevant departments pay attention to the allocation of cadres in this area. Develop our team and strengthen our strength.

Fellow representatives, fellow committee members, the reports of the two Vice Premiers are our battle calls, and also a beautiful poem, a brilliant and splendid painting. It points out to each of us our work tasks and goals to strive for. Vice Premier Li Fuchun has already given us great good news: the total industrial output value in the first quarter of 1960 is expected to increase by 80% compared with the same period last year. In terms of capital construction, compared with before liberation and even the early days of liberation, when north of the Yellow River, it was still the season when the ice was just thawing and the soil was being broken, today we have already completed about 20%. Now that the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming, and the season suitable for construction has arrived, construction work will leap forward at a greater speed. I also thought that no matter what kind of economic construction or cultural construction, which one does not need houses? Whether it is a city, a worker town, a people's commune, or a residential area, which one does not need planning? Our construction work is directly and comprehensively closely related to everyone's production and life. We are deeply aware of the glory and arduousness of our work. The more the east wind blows, the more motivated we become. We have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the infinite wisdom and strength of the broad masses. As long as we study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, we can win every battle. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the construction workers across the country will hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, set higher ambitions, and muster soaring enthusiasm to plan and build thousands upon thousands of new socialist communist towns and new villages on the vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers of our great motherland—or rather, to strive for the glorious task of promoting the gradual elimination of the differences between urban and rural areas.

    建筑工作者的新任务
    梁思成代表谈大办城市人民公社后要考虑新的城乡规划
    我国的城市建设和农村建设，都是为了适应国民经济建设的需要，按照一定的规划，有计划地进行的。农村人民公社的进一步巩固和城市大办人民公社，就不仅要求我们去完成更多的城乡规划任务，而且要解决许多新的问题。妥善地解决这些问题，这是我们建筑工作者的光荣任务。主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告，人大常委会的工作报告和陈叔通副主席的政协常委会工作报告。三位副总理的报告是振奋人心、鼓舞干劲的战斗的号角。作为一个建筑工作者，我以无比兴奋的心情注意到国家预算中基本建设投资额是三百二十五亿元，占国家总支出的46％左右。再加上上年结余和地方自筹的投资约六十亿元，总额就达到三百八十五亿元左右了。在基本建设中，一般工业企业的费用约有一半用在建筑上，假使大体上照这样推算下来，在1960年中，将有大约一百九十亿元的资金由我们建筑工作者手中花出去。这就使我们更具体地体会到李先念副总理所指出的和1960年美国政府预算的鲜明对比。美国预算的军费占57.1％，是一个剑拔弩张，青面獠牙的扩军备战的预算。而我们的预算中，仅仅是基本建设投资就占了45％左右，这就有力地说明我们“从事和平劳动的热烈愿望和节减国家经费加速社会主义建设的坚强决心”。这样的具体体会给了我们更大的鼓舞，鼓起了我们更高的干劲。我们建筑工作者坚决响应党和政府的号召，一定更多、更快、更好、更省地完成党和政府交给我们的光荣任务。
    我们的社会主义建筑是按照全国和地方的经济、文化建设计划而进行建设的。每一个城市、工人镇或人民公社的建设都必须首先按照计划的要求，将生产和生活需要的建筑做出合理安排。那就是我们城乡规划和建设的工作。现在我就这方面的问题发表一些意见。
    十年来，随着各项建设事业、特别是工业建设的蓬勃发展，我国的城市建设也有迅速发展。据统计，我们已经在二千一百多个城镇中进行了程度不同的建设工作；其中平地起家，完全新建的城镇有一百六十七个；大规模扩建、改建的城市有一百二十四个。由于大规模地进行了新建、改建和扩建工作，就使我国城市的分布状况，旧城市的经济构成、内部布局和城市面貌都发生了很大的变化，城市人口已经比解放前的四千多万，增加了一倍以上。许多城市的建筑面积增长了几倍或几十倍。我国的城市建设在十年以内已经跑过了历史上几百年甚至上千年的路程。
    在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年的大跃进开始了我国社会主义建设的新阶段。我们国家的各项事业就更加蓬勃地发展起来，到处都在轰轰烈烈地进行建设。国民经济持续大跃进，特别是工业建设大发展的需要，促使我国的城市建设也以飞快的步伐向前奔跑。我国的城市正在以空前的高速度，从来没有过的大规模在发展着、建设着。根据初步统计，两年来，在城镇里建成的工厂、住宅和公共建筑的面积约达两亿九千万平方米以上。举个例子来说，若按上海市现有的建筑面积计算，在仅仅两年中，我们就已建成了三个乃至四个大上海了。许多新的工业基地正在大规模地进行建设。新的城市正在迅速地形成。许多大中城市、省会和自治区首府的改建工作正在有计划地进行。规模巨大的首都改建工作正在全面展开；十大工程就是一个明显的例证。首都天安门广场和长安街，上海的闵行一条街，南昌的八一大道等，都以其宏伟的气魄，优美的风格表现出社会主义城市的新面貌。在城市建设飞跃发展的同时，农村人民公社也进行了大量的新型农村的建设。河北徐水的商庄人民公社，广东花县新华人民公社，上海的长征人民公社，四川成都的金牛人民公社等等，都以飞快的速度建成了第一批新农村。社员们高高兴兴地住上了过去城里人都住不上的，阳光充足，清洁美观的新房子。我国的城市和农村正向着现代化的园林化的方向发展。这是十分令人兴奋的事情，作为一个建筑工作者，我尤其感到欢欣鼓舞。
    我国的城市建设和农村建设都是为了适应国家经济建设的需要，按照一定的规划，有计划地进行的。城乡规划和区域规划也有了很大的开展。1958年以来，全国城市规划已经由重点而普及到所有的城市。在设市的一百八十多个城市中，都有了深度不同的总体规划。我们已进行了许多县城和新工人镇的规划。在全国一千七百多个县城中，大约三分之二以上都有了粗略的规划。这样就保证了城市中各项建设项目、特别是大量的工业建设项目比较合理的安排和整个城市比较合理的布局，使城市的各个局部有机地结合起来，近期和远期相互照应。
    为了适应农村人民公社的发展，各地贯彻了党的八届六中全会关于“逐步改造现有的旧式房屋，分期分批地建设新型的园林化的乡镇和村的居民点”的指示，进行了农村人民公社居民点的建设规划试点，取得了初步经验。
    区域规划也正在大力开展。据我所知道的，全国有四十几个地区，正在进行着初步的规划安排，对于工业、农业、交通运输、水利、电力、城镇、居民点等开始进行战略性的部署。
    全国城乡规划和建设在这样短的时间内取得如此巨大的成就，实在是一个惊人的奇迹。只有在像我们这样的社会主义国家才会出现。这是在党的领导下，大走群众路线的成果，也是全体城乡规划和建筑工作人员不断地进行思想革命、技术革命的成果。
    1958年6月建筑工程部在青岛召开的全国城市规划工作座谈会，对全国城乡规划的大发展起了很大的促进作用，根据总路线的要求和大跃进的新形势，提出了城市规划工作的方针、任务和从实际出发逐步实现城市现代化的方向，把城市规划推向一个全面发展的新阶段。座谈会强调了党委领导，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，提倡解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。因而促进城市规划工作大大的向前迈进了一步。几年以来，城市规划工作人员的思想，在实际工作中经历了一个有破有立的过程。那就是：破只能少数人搞规划的神秘观点，立党的领导、政治挂帅、依靠群众和各部门协作搞规划的思想；破不合理的规章制度，立简便易行的规划做法；破重远景规划轻近期规划的作法，立远近结合、以近期规划为主的作法；破不问城市大小，不分轻重缓急，硬要按照一定程序去作，立由粗到细，先粗后细，逐步深入的规划方法。这一套的破立就使城市规划干部的政治思想水平和业务技术水平得到很大的提高，创造了适合我国情况的群众路线的规划方法。目前在规划设计部门开展的以快速优质为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经取得了显著的效果。规划设计的技术工作初步实现了资料手册化、计算图表化、设计模型化、绘图工具的机械化和半机械化。有的并且配套成龙。由于依靠党的领导，大走群众路线的规划方法，再加上进行了这一系列的思想革命和技术革命，就大大缩短了城市规划的时间。像辽宁朝阳地区的区域规划这样复杂的工作，由于党委领导，书记挂帅，大走群众路线，大搞共产主义协作，在短短两个月的时间内，就基本上初步完成了任务。已经搞过的城市规划，除去部分大中城市，一般搞的较深较细以外，其他都比较粗一点。但是也基本上适应了建设的需要，初步安排了各项建设，而且这些规划还在不断地充实、完善、加深加细。
    社会主义革命的不断深入，社会主义建设的不断向前发展，总是给我们提出需要解决的新任务和新问题。1960年是我国第二个五年计划后三年的第一年。按照国民经济计划草案的要求，国家的工农业生产和基本建设规模，将有很大的增长。农村人民公社的进一步巩固发展，和城市大办人民公社，就不仅要求我们去完成新的更多的城乡规划任务，而且要解决许多新的问题。正确地解决这些问题，也是我们建筑工作者的一项崭新的光荣任务。这些问题很多，在这里我只能就几个主要方面谈一下。
    党和政府所规定的我国城市的发展将是大中小相结合，以发展中小城市为主的方针，是完全正确的。这个方针符合工业建设遍地开花的情况，有利于生产力的合理分布，加速城乡差别的消灭，并促进了城市的发展和变化。建筑工程部青岛城市规划工作座谈会所提出的：大城市应该有计划的建立卫星城镇，以及从实际出发，我国城市逐步向现代化方向发展，必须根据我国的目前经济状况，勤俭办理城市的一切建设事业。从几年来的实际情况看来，我个人认为也是很恰当的。既有利于生产，也有利于人民生活的改善，使我们的城镇成为具有高度科学、文化的现代化城市。我们应该努力贯彻实现。
    李富春副总理在报告中说：“现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动”。如何根据城市人民公社发展的要求进行城市规划，是摆在建筑工作者面前的一个新问题。我们应该很好的加以研究。社会主义的城市规划和建设事实上就是通过工厂、住宅、公共建筑、街道、绿地等等的合理安排，发挥着组织人民经济和生活的作用。因此，城市规划要考虑进一步妥善地安排为家庭妇女参加社会劳动所需要的街道工厂和为全体居民服务的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等生活福利设施。
    除此而外，我觉得更重要的是：城市人民公社这个新思想、新生活、新问题、新事物是我们过去所不熟悉的。我们对于这种新的生活方式可能不那么习惯。在这方面如何改造我们的旧思想、旧观点和旧的生活习惯是一个极为重要的问题。我们应该研究它、了解它；而且只有亲身参加到这个运动中才能深刻地体会到它的伟大正确和深远意义，并为之欢欣鼓舞。我们一定要坚决地跟着党走，在党的领导下，为城市人民公社的普遍实现而努力。
    我国各项社会主义建设事业如此高速度的发展，旧城市的改建也成了一个现实的问题，在市政设施、房屋住宅和城市面貌的改造以及实现园林化方面的任务还是很大的。现在，在许多大中城市开始进行的或正在酝酿的城市中心区和一条街的改建计划是一个很好的开端。我们建筑工作者在改建城市的过程中，应该发挥更大的积极性，创造丰富多采的，各具特色的城市建筑面貌。
    1960年的国民经济计划确定“以农业为基础，以工业为主导”，并且号召“各个部门都要把支援农业当作自己的重要任务”。我们建筑工作者应该十分重视这方面的问题。我们的新农村不但将是现代化农业的农村，而且也将是具有公社工业的新农村。这种新型农村的规划和建设是我们今后的重要任务。一年多以来，我们虽然已经进行了若干个人民公社的规划，但工作还做得不够。今后我们应该拿出更大的力量，给以更多的支援，和群众在一起，虚心听取他们的意见，积极参加农村人民公社居民点的规划和建设。除了合理部署住宅和一整套的生活福利设施，以及牛棚、猪舍、拖拉机汽车站和各式各样的农村工厂、车间外，还应该为这些建筑物提供设计图纸，并在技术上给予指导，培养农村的规划建设干部和建筑工人。
    结合着支援农业和培养干部问题，在这里举一个例子附带汇报一下一个高等学校在这方面所做的一些工作。清华大学建筑系、土木系在1958年就在毛主席曾经去过的徐水大寺各庄和社员们一道规划、设计并建立了一个居民点。一年多以来，社员们生产热情更加高涨了。他们说：“去年咱村夺得保定专区的丰产大帅旗，这些楼房也得记一功。”“就凭对生产的方便和社员们住楼的高兴，咱村的生产今年又得翻一番。”从此清华大学在徐水就扎下了根。最近又有一批师生约九十余人响应中央的号召开到徐水，在县委和公社党委的领导下，和各级干部和广大群众一道作出了公社的建设规划，解决了由于实现农业现代化所提出来的迫切任务，为马上就要建设的公社工业和拖拉机站和机耕道路、医院建筑等等做了安排、定了线。师生们并结合当地为实现“千百万”（千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯）的中心宣传任务，画了一幅一丈八尺长的宣传画，编了快板诗，在田间在街头广泛宣传，形象地描绘了共产主义商庄建设的情景，大大地鼓舞了社员们的积极性，师生们自己也得到了深刻的教育。由于他们在整个工作过程的各个环节中，把政治和思想教育和规划业务结合起来，把群众性宣传工作和规划的业务工作结合起来，使大家获得了思想、业务双丰收。这又一次生动地证明了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”之英明、正确。一批又红又专的建设干部在战斗中迅速成长起来了。
    城乡规划的技术革命，在已经取得显著成果的基础上，正在继续大力进行中。不论在规划的组织领导、内容和作法上都大有发展。不断地进行技术革命，不仅是完成新的巨大的规划和建设任务所需要，而且也是为解决面临的新问题所不能缺少的。在目前飞跃发展的形势下，在这里汇报城市规划工作上的技术革新、技术革命是不太容易的。今天的新鲜事，明天就会被更新鲜的事超过去、比了下去。但我还是抑制不住谈一谈我所知道的最近的情况。例如许多规划部门已经创造了成龙配套的快速规划设计法以及各种各样或土或洋的仪器工具。还创造了规划过程中的“几化、几法”，例如设计标准化、计算图表化电气化、制图装配化印刷化、工具机械化半机械化、资料系统化、手册化，和模型法、查表法、摄影化、模板法、剪贴法、拼凑法、滚筒法、印刷法等等。这个运动正在蓬勃深入地开展，毫无疑问，就在此刻，更多的新的“化”、新的“法”，新的理论，更重要的，新的思想已经又出现了。
    我们城市规划设计的工作人员一向是十分努力的，已经做出了很大的成绩。但是，我觉得我国现有的规划技术干部，毕竟还是不多的，比任何部门的技术人员少的多。城市规划力量，应该大大发展；各省和各大中城市都应该建立和发展自己的规划设计机构，以便适应大规模的城市建设需要。除有关的学校和规划部门应该积极地、大量地、迅速地培养这方面的干部以外，建议有关部门注意这方面干部的配备。发展我们的队伍，壮大我们的力量。
    各位代表、各位委员，两位副总理的报告是我们战斗的号角，也是一首美丽的诗篇，是一幅光辉灿烂的画图。它给我们每一个人指出了自己的工作任务和奋斗的目标。李富春副总理已经给了我们莫大的喜报：1960年第一季度的工业总产值预计比去年同期增长80％。在基本建设方面，和解放前以至解放初期对比，当黄河以北，过去还是刚刚解冻破土的季节，今天我们却已经完成了20％左右了。现在，春暖花开，适宜于建筑施工的季节已经到来，建筑工作将以更大的速度跃进。我还想到，无论经济建设、文化建设哪一样不需要房屋呢？无论城市、工人镇、人民公社、居民点，哪一个不需要规划呢？我们的建筑工作就是直接地、全面地和每一个人的生产和生活密切联系着的。我们深深地意识到我们工作的光荣和艰巨，东风越刮，我们的干劲越鼓。我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，有广大群众无穷无尽的智慧和力量。我们只要更加努力地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，我们就可以无往而不胜利。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们全国的建筑工作者将更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，立下更大雄心壮志，鼓起冲天干劲，为在伟大祖国九百六十万平方公里的广阔土地上，规划并建造千千万万个社会主义共产主义的新城镇、新农村——更正确地说，为促进城市和农村差别的逐步消灭的光荣任务而奋斗。
