Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 24th: The Changchun Dongfeng People's Commune, centered around the First Automobile Works and composed of factory worker families and suburban farmers, is mobilizing all forces to serve automobile production, powerfully promoting the great leap forward in production at the First Automobile Works.

Of the ten small and medium-sized factories established by this urban people's commune in November 1958, seven directly serve automobile production. Their products include 41 items and over 100 varieties, including castings needed for the production of Red Flag brand sedans, as well as various molds, dies, and labor protection equipment. The commune's agricultural management area also supplies the automobile factory's workers with a large amount of vegetables and meat. The commune also has more than 1,300 service personnel, forming a comprehensive service network to serve the lives of the automobile factory's workers.

The Dongfeng People's Commune is a product of the Great Leap Forward. Beginning in the spring of 1958, the First Automobile Works successively launched mass movements such as producing one hundred automobiles per shift, producing two hundred and fifty automobiles per shift, large-scale steelmaking, and trial production of Red Flag brand high-end sedans. A great situation of overall leap forward appeared throughout the factory. However, the Great Leap Forward also brought certain contradictions, the most important of which were labor shortages and insufficient supply of certain materials. On the other hand, inspired by the Great Leap Forward situation, the families of the automobile factory's workers were eager to break free from household chores and directly participate in production. At this time, influenced by the rural people's commune movement, the factory's workers and people in the factory area were considering establishing a people's commune to further organize all forces. After careful preparation, the Dongfeng People's Commune was officially established on November 7, 1958. In addition to the First Automobile Works and other units, this commune also includes three street management areas and two agricultural management areas, with a total population of 80,000, of which the automobile factory's workers and their families account for about 75%.

After its establishment, the Dongfeng People's Commune clearly made supporting automobile production its primary task. Over the past year, the commune, through extensive mobilization work and the establishment of numerous collective welfare undertakings, has enabled a large number of housewives to take up production posts. Among them, 1,800 directly joined the First Automobile Works in production, and more than 3,000 others participated in community-run industries and collective welfare undertakings that mainly serve automobile production.

Since its establishment, the Dongfeng People's Commune has established more than 20 small factories, which were later reorganized and merged into ten small and medium-sized factories. Over the past year, these factories have developed greatly. In 1959, the total value of production reached 1.54 million yuan, an increase of more than three times compared to 1958. Among these ten factories, seven factories, including a machinery factory, a carpentry factory, a chemical factory, a refractory materials factory, a laundry and dyeing factory, a knitting factory, and a sewing factory, directly serve automobile production. These factories use the waste materials from the automobile factory to process various castings, automobile parts, chemical products, instrument tubes, various wood products, and various labor protection products, totaling more than 100 varieties, which are supplied to the automobile factory in large quantities. For example, the commune's machinery factory, which has more than 220 workers, produces various castings and other parts for the automobile factory year-round. Last year, it produced more than 290 tons of various castings for the automobile factory. Each Red Flag brand sedan produced in batches has more than 70 castings processed by this factory.

The commune's agricultural management area also established some small factories using local materials. For example, it established a weaving factory to weave baskets for holding soil, which are supplied to the automobile factory for use in repairing and building houses; it established a crude oil factory to extract gasoline from the automobile factory's sewage. Other factories established by the commune used the edge materials and scraps from the automobile factory to produce some small hardware, daily-use furniture, and other products to supply the needs of the automobile factory's workers. In terms of agricultural production, the two agricultural management areas implemented the production policy of focusing on vegetables and meat, producing a large amount of various vegetables and meat, eggs, and other non-staple foods, basically guaranteeing the needs of the automobile factory's workers and their families. The commune also established 22 service stations and 304 service points, providing more than 100 service items such as washing, mending, shoe repair, and purchasing on behalf of customers. More than 1,300 service personnel come to the single dormitories and family dormitories in the automobile factory's residential area every day to serve the workers and their families, greatly facilitating the lives of the automobile factory's workers. Various service departments have especially carried out service work centering on production. When the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the automobile factory formed a climax, many workers fought until late at night, and service personnel from food stores and other places would send prepared pastries, pancakes, steamed buns, and other foods to the workshops.

While fully supporting the production of the automobile factory, the various undertakings established by the commune have also received strong support from the First Automobile Works. The community-run factories have received enthusiastic support from the automobile factory in terms of technology, raw materials, and other materials. The electrical equipment of the commune's carpentry factory was installed with the help of automobile workers, and some automobile workers often come to the carpentry factory to help with safety inspections and machine maintenance. With the help of the automobile factory, the commune's agricultural management area has newly built three pumping stations, creating favorable conditions for converting dry land into irrigated land and converting large fields into vegetable fields.

In the year since its establishment, in addition to industrial and agricultural production, other undertakings of the Dongfeng Commune have also been vigorously developed. The commune has now universalized primary school education, established four middle schools, and among more than 4,000 illiterate people, more than 3,000 have become literate and are participating in higher primary classes. Recently, the commune has also established an industrial technical school and a normal technical school, and has also newly built two cultural centers, and established many political theory learning groups and amateur art troupes. In terms of collective welfare undertakings, in addition to the units serving the workers of the automobile factory, it has also established seven canteens, 27 food processing points, and 22 life service stations and more than 300 service points for street residents. It has also established 21 collective canteens, nurseries, stations, and other facilities in the agricultural management area.

Currently, under the guidance of the principle of serving automobile production, the Dongfeng People's Commune is comprehensively arranging future production and construction. Since the beginning of this year, the commune has newly built nine factories, bringing the number of community-run factories to 19. It is estimated that the number of products will increase from more than 100 to more than 300, and there will be 257 collaborative products directly produced for the automobile factory, becoming a more powerful auxiliary force for the automobile factory. In terms of non-staple food production, the production of vegetables this year will increase by 22 times compared to last year, and the pig and chicken raising industries will be vigorously developed. There will also be great developments in other aspects, to better serve the continuous leap forward in automobile production.

    把支援汽车生产持续跃进作为首要任务
    东风公社建设事业蓬勃发展
    据新华社长春24日电　以第一汽车制造厂为中心、由职工家属和郊区农民参加组成的长春市东风人民公社，调动各种力量为汽车生产服务，有力地促进了第一汽车制造厂的生产大跃进。
    这个在1958年11月成立的城市人民公社，去年举办的十个中、小型工厂中就有七个直接为汽车生产服务，产品有四十一项、一百多种，其中有为生产红旗牌轿车需要的铸件，以及各种胎具、模具和劳动保护用品等。公社的农业管理区也以大量蔬菜和肉食供应了汽车厂的职工。公社还有一千三百多名服务员，组成一个周密的服务网，为汽车厂职工们的生活服务。
    东风人民公社是生产大跃进的产物。从1958年春季开始，第一汽车制造厂先后掀起了班产百辆汽车、班产二百五十辆汽车、大炼钢铁和试制红旗牌高级轿车等群众运动，全厂出现了全面跃进的大好局面。但是，大跃进也带来了某些矛盾，其中最主要的是劳动力不足和某些材料供应不足。另一方面，汽车厂的职工家属在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，迫切要求摆脱家务牵累，直接参加生产。这时，全厂职工和厂区人民在农村人民公社化运动的影响下，就酝酿要成立人民公社，把各方面的力量进一步组织起来。在进行了缜密的准备以后，1958年11月7日正式成立了东风人民公社。这个公社除第一汽车制造厂等单位外，还包括三个街道管理区和两个农业管理区，共计有八万人口，其中汽车厂的职工和他们的家属占75％左右。
    东风人民公社成立以后，就明确地把支援汽车生产作为首要任务。一年多以来，公社由于进行了广泛的发动工作和举办了大量集体福利事业，使大批家庭妇女走上了生产岗位，其中有一千八百人直接到第一汽车厂参加生产，另外还有三千多人参加了主要为汽车生产服务的社办工业和集体福利事业。
    东风人民公社成立以后，就办起了二十多个小工厂，后来经过整顿，合并成为十个中小型工厂。一年多来，这些工厂有了很大发展，1959年的生产总值达到一百五十四万元，比1958年增长三倍多。在这十个工厂中，有机械厂、木工厂、化工厂、耐火材料厂、洗染厂、针织厂、缝纫厂共七个工厂，直接为汽车生产服务。这些工厂利用汽车厂的下脚料加工成各种铸件、汽车零件、化工产品、仪器管、各种木制品和各种劳动保护用品等共一百多种产品，大量供应了汽车厂的需要。例如拥有二百二十多名工人的公社机械厂，常年为汽车厂生产各种铸件和其他零件，去年全年为汽车厂生产的各种铸件达二百九十多吨，成批生产的红旗牌轿车，每辆都有这个厂加工的七十多个铸件。
    公社的农业管理区也就地取材举办了一些小工厂，例如成立编织厂编制装土用的篮子，供应汽车厂在修造房屋时使用；举办了清油厂，从汽车厂的污水中提炼出了汽油。公社举办的另外一些工厂，利用汽车厂的边材余料，生产了一些小五金、日用家具等产品，供应了汽车厂职工的需要。在农业生产方面，两个农业管理区贯彻以菜、肉为纲的生产方针，大量生产了各种蔬菜和肉、蛋等副食品，基本上保证了汽车厂职工和家属的需要。公社还办了二十二个服务站、三百零四个服务点，服务项目有拆洗、缝补、修鞋、代购等一百多种，有一千三百多名服务员每天到汽车厂宿舍区的独身宿舍和家属宿舍来为职工和职工家属服务，使汽车厂工人的生活大为方便。各个服务部门特别围绕生产开展了服务工作。当汽车厂的技术革新和技术革命运动形成高潮的时候，许多职工奋战到深夜，食品店等服务员就将做好的糕点、煎饼、馒头等食品送到车间。
    公社举办的各项事业在全力支援汽车厂生产的同时，也得到了第一汽车制造厂的有力支援。社办工厂在技术、原料材料等方面得到了汽车厂的热情支援，公社木工厂的电气设备就是汽车工人帮助安装的，有些汽车工人还经常到木工厂来帮助进行安全检查和维修机器。公社的农业管理区在汽车厂的帮助下新建了抽水站三处，为旱田改水浇、大田改菜田创造了有利条件。
    东风公社在成立后的一年多中，除了工、农业生产外，其他各项事业也得到蓬勃发展。全社现在已经普及小学教育，举办了四所中学，在四千多名文盲中，已有三千多名脱盲参加高小班学习。最近公社又办起一所工业专科学校和一所师范专科学校，还新建了两处文化馆，成立了许多政治理论学习小组和业余文工团。在集体福利事业方面，除了为汽车厂职工服务的单位外，还为街道居民举办了七处食堂、二十七个食品加工点和二十二个生活服务站、三百多个服务点，在农业管理区也办起了二十一个集体食堂，托儿所、站等共三十多处。
    目前，东风人民公社正在为汽车生产服务的方针指导下，全面安排今后的生产和建设。今年以来，公社已经新建了九座工厂，使社办工厂发展到十九座。预计产品将由一百多种增加到三百多种，直接为汽车厂生产的协作产品将有二百五十七项，成为汽车厂的一支更加有力的辅助力量。在副食品生产方面，今年蔬菜的生产量要比去年增长二十二倍，并且要大力发展养猪、养鸡业。其他各方面也都将有很大发展，更好地为汽车生产的持续跃进服务。
