Agricultural Comprehensive Service Stations Have Many Benefits
The service station has a public canteen, a small shop, a savings office, a barber shop, and a health clinic. It also purchases the commune members' local products, by-products, and waste products, and helps the commune members buy daily necessities and see doctors. It does whatever the masses want it to do, and is warmly welcomed by the masses.
Comrade Wang Zhong represents the Fuxin rural areas to promote the experience of comprehensive service stations.

Presidium, fellow representatives:
I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Final State Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," as well as the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." And I will resolutely implement them in future practical work.
Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Fuxin Mongolian Autonomous County, like all parts of the country, achieved a great leap forward in 1959. Taking a few key figures, comparing 1959 and 1958: total grain output increased by 21.5%, vegetables increased by 3.7 times, sheep increased by 72%, total industrial output value increased by 53%, and commune members' income increased by 50.3%.

1960 is a year of even greater and more comprehensive leap forward. All preparations for taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are earlier, better, more lively, and surpass any previous year. From last winter to this spring, 950 water conservancy projects have been completed, of which 410 have been equipped, irrigating 100,000 mu, an increase of 88% over last year; there are currently 20.9 billion jin of fertilizer, with an average application of 92,000 jin per hectare, an increase of 27% over last year; 171,000 hectares of sloping land have been cultivated, an increase of 80% over last year; this year's seeds are all superior seeds cultivated last year; the county has trained more than 5,000 technical backbones and more than 30,000 ordinary technical experts. The Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture has taken root in the hearts of the people. The great leap forward in the past two years has encouraged the people's communes and the vast numbers of commune members of all ethnic groups. The socialist and communist consciousness is constantly improving, and the enthusiasm is being redoubled. We are fully confident and determined to achieve an even greater agricultural harvest in 1960. The spring plowing production is flourishing.
In order to ensure the victory in 1960, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, hold even higher the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and Mao Zedong Thought, and do everything possible to tap all aspects of potential and mobilize all positive factors. According to the Party's instruction to grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and Chairman Mao's teaching on "caring for the lives of the masses and paying attention to working methods," we must firmly grasp production and conscientiously rectify public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and sewing groups. At the same time, we must universally establish comprehensive service stations in commune members' public canteens. The comprehensive service station is like the "Qianmen Hotel" we are staying in now. It has a public canteen, a small shop, savings, a barber shop, and a health clinic. It also collects commune members' local and side-line products, waste materials, writes letters for others, helps commune members raise pigs and engage in side-line occupations, and so on. Because it is set up by the masses themselves with the help of the financial and trade departments, and the masses want it to do whatever they want, it is named a comprehensive service station. With the continuous development of production and the continuous improvement of living standards, the service items are also constantly expanding. Although the service items are so extensive, there are not many service personnel. All of them are undertaken by the canteen managers and the master chefs. This communist labor attitude of increasing work without increasing staff and serving a large number of people with a small number of people is extremely welcomed by the masses.
What problems have the comprehensive service stations solved and what role have they played? The nine comprehensive service stations in the Fujiagou Brigade of the Leyuan People's Commune solved the following major problems in just over a month after their establishment: First, they solved the problem of labor shortage. Since the Great Leap Forward, there has been a shortage of labor in rural areas. However, rural shops and savings offices are too concentrated, and there are not enough medical personnel. Commune members have to delay work and affect production in order to handle many necessary personal affairs such as selling local and side-line products, buying daily necessities, and seeing doctors. According to a survey by the Fujiagou Brigade, 510 male and female laborers lost two to three workdays per person per month due to the above reasons before the establishment of the stations. After the establishment of the stations, there were more than 1,500 more workdays per month. Before the establishment of the station, the average number of people working in the fourth team was 38 per day, and after the establishment of the station, it reached 53, an increase of 40%. The production efficiency of the entire brigade increased by 35% after the establishment of the station. Facts have proved that comprehensive service stations are an effective way to solve the contradiction between personal affairs and collective production, further tap the potential of labor, promote production, and improve the lives of the masses. It once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant exposition on "caring for the lives of the masses and paying attention to working methods." Second, they solved the problem of funds. The realization of the "four modernizations" in agriculture and the improvement of the lives of commune members require a large amount of funds. Where do the funds come from? The funds come from the countryside. Comprehensive service stations play a role in expanding resources, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, being diligent and thrifty in managing households, and being diligent and thrifty in running communes, implementing the principle of self-reliance, and embodying the policy of walking on two legs. The Fujiagou Brigade needed 4,910 yuan for the "four modernizations," which could not be solved. After the comprehensive service station fully mobilized the masses, extensively excavated waste materials, lived a thrifty life, and adopted a self-reliant method, the commune members saved 4,750 yuan in one month, and the income from raising pigs and pulling carts was 7,500 yuan. Not only did it solve the shortage, but it also had a surplus. It purchased a large number of production materials and also distributed 1,500 yuan to the commune members, which strongly supported production. Many waste materials from the commune members' homes were sold to the supply and marketing cooperatives, which increased the income of the commune members and increased industrial raw materials for the country. Third, it facilitated the masses. Before the establishment of the service station, the Fujiagou Brigade was a brigade with insufficient rations. With the help of the service station, the method of increasing the amount of grain consumed was promoted. Not only did they eat their fill, but they also saved more than 1,600 jin per month. In the past month, this team gave 35 haircuts and 59 bald haircuts to the commune members, all of which were done before and after meals, and no one delayed work. When Chen Yi's son had a cold, Chen picked up five jin of bad shoes and exchanged them for two bags of "Zhengtong Pills" from the service station and he recovered. Chen Yi happily said: "It's like a doctor curing the disease by exchanging broken shoes for medicine; the amount of money is a small matter, not delaying work is a big matter." It achieved "selling goods without leaving home and buying goods without leaving the station," which facilitated the masses and stimulated the enthusiasm for production. The masses saw the benefits of the comprehensive service station from their own practical experience. They praised:
The service station is really good, we must resolutely promote it,
Whoever destroys it, we must never forgive them.
After the emergence of the Fujiagou Comprehensive Service Station, the Fuxin County Party Committee attached great importance to it. From March 18 to 20, the County Party Committee held a thousand-person conference to promptly promote this experience. By the end of March, 1,455 comprehensive service stations had been established in the county's 1,776 public canteens, blooming everywhere. The comprehensive service station, which was created during the continuous leap forward in 1960, is a new form and new method for more widely organizing the masses to engage in economic life and welfare undertakings. It is also a good form and good method for further implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in managing households, diligence and thrift in running communes, self-reliance, and walking on two legs. This is another great victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and Mao Zedong Thought. It will promote the victory of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1960.
Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and wish all the representatives good health.

    农业综合服务站好处多
    服务站办有公共食堂、小商店、储蓄所、理发所、卫生所；它还收买社员的土产品、副产品、废品，帮助社员买日用品、请大夫，群众要它做什么就做什么，受到群众热烈欢迎。
    王忠代表介绍阜新农村大办综合服务站的经验主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”以及“人大常务委员会工作报告”。并在今后实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    阜新蒙古族自治县在党中央毛主席英明领导下，1959年同全国各地一样取得了大跃进。以几个主要数字1959年和1958年比较来说：粮食总产量增长21.5％、蔬菜增长三点七倍、羊增长72％、工业总产值增长53％、社员收入增长50.3％。
    1960年是更大更全面跃进的形势。以粮为纲，农林牧副渔全面大发展的一切准备都是又早又好，有声有色，胜过以往任何一年。去冬今春完成水利建设九百五十项，其中四百一十项已经配成套，已经灌溉十万市亩，比去年提高88％；现有二百零九亿斤?肥，每垧地平均施九万二千斤，比去年提高27％；坂地整地十七万一千垧，比去年提高80％；今年的种子都是去年培选出来的优良种子；全县已经培训五千多名技术骨干和三万多普通技术能手。农业八字宪法已经深入人心，过去两年连年大跃进鼓舞着人民公社和各族广大社员，社会主义共产主义觉悟不断的提高，干劲一鼓再鼓，更大更全面跃进完全有信心有决心，夺取1960年农业更大丰收的春耕生产正在蓬蓬勃勃的开展起来。
    为了保证打好1960年胜利仗，就必须加强党的领导，更高的举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社和毛泽东思想红旗，千方百计，挖掘各方面潜力，调动一切积极因素。根据党的一手抓生产，一手抓生活的指示和毛主席关于“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的教导，狠抓生产，认真整顿公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝衣组，同时，在社员公共食堂普遍建立综合服务站工作。综合服务站就像我们现在住的“前门饭店”那样，设有公共食堂、小卖店、储蓄、理发、卫生所，它还代收社员土副废品、代写书信、帮助社员养猪搞副业等等。因为它是在财贸部门帮助下由群众自己搞起来的，群众要它作什么就作什么，所以命名为综合服务站。随着生产的不断发展、生活不断提高的要求，服务项目也不断的扩大。服务项目如此之广，但服务人员并不多，全由食堂管理员和作饭菜的老师傅承担起来，这种增事不增人，人少服大务的共产主义劳动态度，受到群众极大的欢迎。
    综合服务站解决了什么问题，起到什么作用呢？乐源人民公社富家洼子大队的九个综合服务站建站后一个多月解决了以下几个主要问题：首先，解决了劳动力问题。大跃进以来农村劳动力本来就感到不足，但农村商店、储蓄所过于集中，医务人员不足，社员们处理出售土副废品购买日用品、请大夫、理发等许多个人的必需事务就必须误工影响生产，据富家洼子大队调查，五百一十名男女劳动力建站前因上述原因每人每月误两个到三个工日，建站后一个月就多出勤一千五百多个，第四小队建站前每天干活的平均为三十八人，建站之后达到五十三人，增加了40％。全大队建站后的生产效率提高35％。事实证明综合服务站是解决个人事务与集体生产之间矛盾、进一步挖掘劳动力潜力，促进生产改善群众生活的有效方法，它又一次证明毛主席关于“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”英明论述的正确性。其次，解决了资金问题。农业实现“四化”，社员改善生活都需要大批资金，资金从哪里来呢？资金来自农村。综合服务站起到开扩资源、因地制宜、就地取材、勤俭持家、勤俭办社，贯彻了自力更生，体现了两条腿走路的方针。富家洼子大队需要“四化”资金四千九百一十元解决不了，经过综合服务站，充分发动群众，广泛挖掘废旧物资，勤俭过日子，自力更生办法，一个月社员储蓄四千七百五十元，养猪和拉脚收入七千五百元，不但解决了不足还达到有余，买进了大批生产资料，还分给社员一千五百元，有力地支援了生产。社员家的许多废旧物资都卖给供销社，使社员增加了收入，使国家增加工业原料。第三，方便了群众。富家洼子大队建立服务站前是口粮不太足的大队，经过服务站帮助推广粮食增量食用法，不但吃饱吃好，还每月节余出一千六百多斤。这个队近一个月给社员剪三十五个长发、五十九个光头都是吃饭前后作的，谁也没误工。社员陈义儿子感冒的时候，陈拣五斤坏鞋从服务站换来两袋“正痛片”吃了就好了。陈义高兴地说：“用破鞋换药吃，也顶医生治好病了；花钱多少是小事，不误工是大事。”作到了“卖货不离家，买货不离站”，便利了群众，激发了生产积极性。群众从自己实际体验中看到综合服务站的好处，他们歌颂：
    服务站真正好，我们要坚决搞，
    谁要破坏了它，我们决不能饶。
    富家洼子综合服务站出现后，阜新县委极为重视。县委在3月18到20日召开了千人大会及时推广了这个经验，到3月底全县一千七百七十六个公共食堂中已经建立起一千四百五十五个综合服务站，遍地开花。在1960年持续跃进的时候产生的综合服务站，是更广泛组织群众大搞经济生活和福利事业的新形式新方法，也是进一步贯彻执行勤俭持家、勤俭办社、自力更生、两条腿走路方针的好形式好办法，这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社和毛泽东思想又一次的伟大胜利，它将会推动1960年以粮为纲、农林牧副渔全面发展的胜利。
    最后祝大会胜利成功，祝全体代表身体健康。
