Chairman, fellow representatives:

I wholeheartedly endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and will conscientiously implement them in my future work. Now, I will report on the continuous great leap forward of Jixi Coal Mine in the past two years and the current situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement as follows.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the entire staff of Jixi Coal Mine, like all brother enterprises across the country, also achieved a continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959 with outstanding results. In 1958, raw coal production increased by 47.2% compared with 1957, and in 1959, it increased by another 39.1% compared with 1958. The sum of the production in these two years is almost equal to the total production of Jixi Coal Mine during the First Five-Year Plan period. The sum of the newly added production capacity in the two years is 41% more than the total in the past five years. In particular, in 1959, the increase was not only one and a half times higher than in 1958, but also exceeded the total newly added capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, due to the strengthening of enterprise management and economic accounting, the cost of products and engineering projects has been declining year by year. It has gradually developed from a single coal mining enterprise into a comprehensive enterprise with diversified production. Before 1958, we were "unarmed"; after 1958, we not only had iron, but also steel. In addition, we also produced crude oil, coke, various small and medium-sized mining machinery, and building materials such as cement and glass, so that some of the commonly used tools, equipment, and materials in the mine can be obtained locally to meet the needs.

With the high-speed development of production, the mental outlook of the people has been completely renewed. After thoroughly implementing the Party's General Line, the socialist consciousness of the vast number of employees has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for work has been unprecedentedly high, resulting in a colorful scene of technical innovation and technical revolution, with advanced collectives, advanced individuals, and advanced deeds constantly emerging. A competition upsurge of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others, is developing wave after wave.

After entering 1960, under the encouragement of the new situation, new stage, and new tasks, we are advancing victoriously along the glorious road of the continuous great leap forward in the past two years. An unprecedented mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is sweeping the entire mining area with tremendous momentum and extraordinary speed. At present, more than 95% of the employees have enthusiastically joined this movement. The realized innovation proposals alone have created a value of 16.4 million yuan. The value created in less than three months has exceeded 9% of the total value created by technical innovation last year. More importantly, more than 500 major innovations have emerged, creating an extremely good start for the fundamental change of the technical face of the mine:

First, liberate heavy manual labor. Coal mining is an industrial sector that uses a large amount of labor, and the proportion of heavy manual labor is relatively large. In Jixi Coal Mine, at the end of last year, only 38% of the production workers engaged in mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. After launching a fierce attack on manual operations and heavy labor this year, it had increased to 64.5% by the end of March; heavy manual labor in manual operations had dropped to 22.6%. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in many units has reached more than 80%. In the past, the degree of mechanization in capital construction units was only about 20%, but now some units have increased it to more than 95%. The most prominent feature in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is the realization of mechanization of coal loading on the coal mining face. At present, 83% of the regular coal mining faces have put down their shovels, basically ending the history of heavy coal loading labor. In particular, after the Muling Coal Mine recently manufactured and used the combined loading and transporting machine, it further simplified the types of work and procedures on the coal mining face, such as moving and maintaining the chutes, coal loading, and chute drivers, saving chute equipment, and eliminating the most frequent chute accidents in the past. At present, some working faces have achieved the practical result of "halving the number of people and doubling the output." The problem of mechanization of the tunneling face, which was considered difficult to solve in the past, has now been solved satisfactorily. The all-purpose tunneling machine and powerful electric drill created and imitated by Muling Coal Mine not only realized the overall mechanization of the main types of work such as loading, transporting, and rock drilling in the tunneling work, but also broke through the rock barrier, opening the door for simplifying the power system, removing air compressors and air ducts, saving power consumption, reducing labor intensity, and preventing dust and reducing occupational diseases. Preliminary estimates show that after comprehensive promotion, more than 100 air compressors and more than 1,500 tons of pipes of various sizes can be removed; the tunneling speed can be increased by at least 15% on the existing basis. At the same time, other heavy manual labor is also constantly developing towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. On the basis of mechanization, 178 single-machine automation, 78 production automatic lines, 127 linkage lines, and one linked mine have emerged. Due to the improvement of the degree of mechanization and automation, 1,870 workers have been saved so far. Before "May Day," we firmly guarantee that the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization will reach more than 90%.

Second, carry out the reform of the six major systems. Through the "four-in-one" method of simplification, concentration, shortening, and adjustment, the six major systems of ventilation, drainage, lifting, transportation, air supply, and power supply are reformed, saving a lot of materials and equipment, and changing the unreasonable layout in the past. At present, simplifying the step-up ring power supply and reforming the drainage and air compression systems alone have saved more than 770,000 yuan in value. This includes 120,000 meters of various wires, more than 9,000 meters of cables, and more than 15,000 meters of various pipes. In addition, there are transformers, air pumps, water pumps, and a large number of other equipment, which can also save about 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. In terms of transportation, the construction of large coal bunkers has now reached two days of storage, greatly alleviating the tense transportation situation. Before "May Day," it can basically be realized that production will continue as usual even if no cars come for three days; loading will continue as usual even if production is stopped for three days. These reforms can not only completely change the decentralized and lack of overall design phenomenon left over from the past, but also create conditions for future mine design and reasonable layout of wind, water, electricity, and transportation systems.

Third, vigorously promote the saving and substitution of pit wood. Coal mining is the industrial sector that uses the most wood. In the case of limited timber resources, saving pit wood is one of the very important measures to ensure sustained high-speed development of production. Since the beginning of this year, we have found new ways to substitute pit wood, and even the slag that is regarded as waste has been made into supports with high strength and low cost. At present, we are working hard to realize pit wood-free wells and pit wood-free mines.

Fourth, carry out a revolution in production organization and universally promote "four-eight" cross-operation. At present, 92% of our regular coal mining faces and 68.4% of our tunneling faces have basically realized "four-eight" cross-operation. According to statistics from 27 coal mining faces that have been consolidated and improved, the output has increased by 15.2% and the efficiency has increased by 12.2% compared with before the promotion. These working faces all embody the characteristics of making full use of time and space, combining work and rest, ensuring safety, enhancing collectivist ideology, and giving play to the spirit of unity and cooperation.

In addition, in order to ensure that all links can adapt to the needs of high-speed development of production, we are currently promoting various advanced experiences in a coordinated manner, and have achieved good results.

In short, the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the Jixi mining area has the characteristics of strong momentum, sufficient drive, rapid action, clear direction, prominent focus, and remarkable results. It has changed from a single, sporadic technical innovation to a systematic and comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution. Through this movement, we have completely broken the artificial convention of "six loosenings and six tightenings" and achieved a good start, a good start every month, and a full house in the first quarter. The raw coal output in the entire quarter exceeded the national plan by 2.6%, an increase of 26.6% compared with the same quarter last year, and the daily output level is constantly rising. Many working faces have achieved a large increase in output. The completed investment amount in the entire quarter increased by more than double compared with the same quarter last year. Since February, the mine construction project has achieved a double increase in the large-scale high-yield indicators of the Ministry of Coal Industry. The most prominent is that the Zhangxin Engineering Zone created the highest record of 346.5 meters for semi-coal and rock downhill tunneling in March, which is more than eight times the high-yield index.

All of these are the victory of the correct leadership of the Party, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Party's General Line and a complete set of policies for walking on two legs, and the victory of the Party's mass line.

In order to consolidate and expand the existing achievements, all employees of Jixi Coal Mine have revised the plan three times. With full confidence, they are holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the red flag of the General Line. Based on the principle of combining the present and the long-term, and combining the general and the cutting-edge, they are further extensively and deeply carrying out the "hundred-meter, thousand-strip, ten-thousand-ton" mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, with communist education as the guideline, liberating heavy manual labor, simplifying the production process, and using less or no pit wood as the main attack direction, achieving large-scale high-yield and comprehensive leap forward as the goal, and using production sports meetings as the main form. They are launching four upsurges of studying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out production and construction, making technical revolution, and cultural revolution, further improving the political and ideological and cultural level of the employees, improving the level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic, and semi-hydraulic; strengthening enterprise management, continuously improving labor productivity, increasing output, accelerating mining and tunneling progress, ensuring the increase in output of coal mining faces, realizing a double increase in coal production, and completing the annual plan one month ahead of schedule; on the existing basis, strive to exceed the large-scale high-yield indicators proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry for mine construction, and ensure that the annual task is completed in half a year. To this end, under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the employees of Jixi Coal Mine, aspire to greatness, set lofty goals, and do everything possible to produce more coal, produce good coal, and strive forward to supply the coal needed for the sustained great leap forward of various sectors of the national economy!

    树雄心　立壮志　多出煤　出好煤
    崔国山代表谈鸡西煤矿怎样持续跃进主席团、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理所作的报告，并在今后工作中认真贯彻执行。现在，我就鸡西煤矿两年多来的连续大跃进和当前技术革新、技术革命运动情况作如下的发言。
    鸡西煤矿全体职工，在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，和全国各地各兄弟企业一样，在1958年和1959年两年当中，也以出色的成绩，实现了连续大跃进。1958年的原煤产量比1957年增长47.2％，1959年又比1958年增长39.1％。这两年产量之和几乎等于鸡西煤矿第一个五年计划期间五年产量的总和。两年新增生产能力之和比过去五年总和还多41％。特别是1959年，不仅比1958年增长一倍半，而且超过了第一个五年计划期间新增能力的总和。同时，由于加强了企业管理和经济核算工作，产品和工程成本均逐年下降。并逐步由单一的煤矿企业发展为多种生产的综合企业。1958年以前，我们“手无寸铁”；1958年以后，我们不仅有铁，而且有钢。另外，还生产了原油、焦炭、各种中小型矿山机械和水泥、玻璃等等建筑材料，使矿山常用的工具设备材料，一部分已能就地取材，满足需要。
    随着生产的高速度发展，人们的精神面貌已焕然一新。广大职工经过深入贯彻党的总路线，社会主义觉悟空前提高，劳动热情空前高涨，因而技术革新、技术革命，万紫千红，先进集体、先进个人和先进事迹不断涌现。一个“学、比、赶、帮”、把困难留给自己、把方便让给别人的竞赛高潮正在一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    进入1960年以后，在新形势、新阶段、新任务的鼓舞下，我们沿着连续两年大跃进的光辉道路，乘胜前进，一个空前的技术革新、技术革命的群众运动，正以磅礴之势，迅猛异常地席卷全矿区。目前95％以上的职工都热烈地投入了这个运动，仅实现的革新建议，已创造价值一千六百四十万元。不到三个月所创造的价值已超过去年全年技术革新创造的总价值9％。更重要的是出现了五百多项重大革新，给矿山技术面貌的根本改变创造了极为良好的开端：
    一、解放笨重体力劳动。煤矿是使用劳动力较多的工业部门，笨重体力劳动所占比重较大。在鸡西煤矿，去年年末从事机械化、半机械化操作的生产工人只占全部生产工人的38％。今年向手工操作、笨重劳动展开猛攻以后，3月末已提高到64.5％；手工操作中的笨重体力劳动已下降到22.6％。不少单位的机械化、半机械化程度已达到80％以上。基本建设单位过去的机械化程度不过20％左右，现在有的单位已提高到95％以上。在技术革新和技术革命的运动中，最突出的是实现了采煤工作面的攉煤机械化。目前已有83％的正规采煤工作面放下了铁锹，基本结束了笨重的攉煤劳动的历史。特别是最近穆棱煤矿制成和使用装运联合机以后，更进一步在采煤工作面简化了移设溜子、维护溜子、攉煤及溜子司机等工种工序，节省了溜子设备，消灭了过去最为频繁的溜子事故。目前有的工作面已收到“人员减半，产量翻番”的实效。过去认为不好解决的掘进工作面的机械化问题，现在也获得了圆满解决。穆棱煤矿创制和仿制的全能掘进机和强力电钻，不仅实现了掘进工作中装、运及凿岩等主要工种的全盘机械化，而且突破了岩石关，为简化动力系统、撤除压风机和压风管路、节省电力消耗、减少劳动强度和防止矿尘飞扬、减轻职业病，打开了大门。初步估计，全面推广后，可撤除压风机一百台以上，大小管材一千五百吨以上；掘进速度至少可在现有基础上提高15％。与此同时，其他笨重体力劳动也都不断地朝机械化、半机械化发展，而且在机械化的基础上出现了单机自动化一百七十八台、生产自动线七十八条、连动线一百二十七条、联动化矿井一座。由于机械化、自动化程度的提高，目前已节省劳动力一千八百七十人。在“五一”以前，我们坚决保证机械化、半机械化程度达到90％以上。
    二、进行六大系统的改革。通过简化、集中、缩短、调整的“四合一”办法，对通风、排水、提升、运输、供风及供电等六大系统进行改革，节省了大量材料设备，改变了过去不合理的布置。目前仅简化升压环形供电和改革排水、压风系统，就节约价值七十七万余元。其中包括各种导线十二万米，电缆九千多米，各种管材一万五千多米。另外还有变压器、风泵、水泵及大批其他器材，每年还可节约电力八百万度左右。运输方面，通过大建煤仓，目前已达到两天贮量，大大地缓和了运输紧张局面。“五一”前基本可以实现三天不来车，照常生产；三天不生产，照常装车。这些改革，不但可以彻底改变过去遗留下来的那种分散的、缺乏整体设计的现象，也给今后进行矿井设计、合理布置风、水、电及运输等系统创造了条件。
    三、大搞坑木节约代用。煤矿是使用木材最多的工业部门，在木材资源有限的情况下，节约坑木是保证持续高速度发展生产非常重要的措施之一。今年以来，我们在代用坑木方面找到了新的途径，甚至连视为废物的矿渣也制出了强度高、成本低的支架。目前我们正在为实现无坑木井和无坑木矿而努力。
    四、进行生产组织大革命，普遍推行“四八”交叉作业。目前我们已有92％的正规采煤工作面和68.4％的掘进工作面基本实现了“四八”交叉作业化。据已获巩固提高的二十七个采煤工作面统计，产量比推广前提高15.2％，效率提高12.2％。这些工作面都体现了充分利用时间和空间、劳逸结合、保证安全、增强集体主义思想、发挥团结协作精神等等特点。
    此外，为了使各个环节都能适应高速度发展生产的需要，目前我们正在配套推广各种先进经验，取得了良好效果。
    总之，当前鸡西矿区的技术革新和技术革命运动，具备了来势猛、干劲足、行动迅速、方向明确、重点突出、效果显著，已经由单一的零星的技术革新走向系统的全面的技术革新和技术革命等等特点。通过这个运动，我们彻底打破了“六松六紧”的人为常规，实现了开门红、月月红、首季满堂红。全季原煤产量超过国家计划2.6％，比去年同季提高26.6％，而且日产水平正在不断上升，不少工作面实现了产量大翻番。全季投资完成额比去年同季增长一倍以上，从2月份开始，矿建工程实现了煤炭工业部大面积高产指标翻一番。最突出的是张新工区于3月份创造了半煤岩下山掘进三百四十六点五米的最高纪录，按高产指标翻了八番多。
    所有这些，都是党的正确领导的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的总路线和一整套用两条腿走路方针的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利。
    为了巩固与扩大既得的胜利成果，我们鸡西市煤矿全体职工，曾三次修订了规划，满怀信心地高举着毛泽东思想的红旗和总路线的红旗，本着当前与长远相结合、一般与尖端相结合的原则，正在进一步广泛深入地开展以共产主义教育为纲、以解放笨重体力劳动、简化生产过程、少用或不用坑木为主攻方向、以大面积高产、全面跃进为目标、以生产运动会为主要形式的“百米、千条、万吨”各项工作大翻番的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，掀起大学毛主席著作、大搞生产建设、大闹技术革命和文化革命的四大高潮，进一步提高职工群众的政治思想和文化水平，提高机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、水力化、半水力化的水平；加强企业管理，不断提高劳动生产率，增加产量，加速采掘进度，确保采煤工作面产量的提高，实现产煤翻番，提前一个月完成全年计划；矿井建设在现有的基础上，力争超过煤炭工业部提出的大面积高产指标，确保全年任务半年完成。为此，我们鸡西市煤矿职工，在党的正确领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，树雄心，立大志，千方百计地，为多出煤、出好煤，供应国民经济各部门实现持续大跃进需要的煤炭而奋勇前进！
