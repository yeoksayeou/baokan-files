    Leading the Masses to Work
      Chen Shi
    After the Hebei Provincial Party Committee issued the battle call to "mobilize the entire party and all the people to take urgent action and engage in the struggle to prevent and combat drought, striving in every possible way to eliminate the spring drought," the Party Committee of Matou People's Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei, immediately convened a cadre flying conference to study and deploy an action plan.
    This plan adopted a series of measures on how to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the drought demon. Regarding leadership methods, the commune party secretary said: "We must personally take action, set an example, and lead the masses to work." Thus, "moving the office to the fields and making the commander a member of the commune again" became an important part of the measures. The Party Committee also called on everyone to avoid wearing leather shoes as much as possible, making it easier to integrate with the commune members. The order was issued, and there was a great response. From the commune and management area to the production team's full-time cadres, everyone could see it being implemented. This shows that our party's fine tradition of connecting with the masses and working hard has deeply taken root in the hearts of the people and is constantly being carried forward.
    Several days later, two comrades began a discussion around the "prohibition." Comrade A said: "Taking off heavy leather shoes and putting on sturdy cloth-soled shoes feels so much lighter!" Comrade B listened and said: "Taking off leather shoes is not a trivial matter; it has profound significance!" Comrade A continued: "In terms of significance, I see three points: First, traveling light to the countryside facilitates in-depth discovery of problems; second, participating in labor enables a detailed understanding of problems; third, working in the fields allows for timely resolution of problems." Comrade B added: "From my perspective, there are also two effects: the supervision and criticism of the masses have a great promoting effect on our work, and our actions greatly encourage the progress of the masses." The common evaluation of the people is: "The principle of 'moving the office to the fields and making the commander a member of the commune again' is completely correct." Why? First, it can effectively guarantee the victory of work; second, if the original plan is partially or completely inconsistent with reality and encounters setbacks, it is easy to correct it in time and then do it correctly, so that the plan can be realized.
    After the leadership went deep into the masses and the front line, the progress of drought resistance and wheat watering in the Matou People's Commune soared, and the quality was good, earning it a place among the top communes in Jiahe County's twenty-three communes. A more concrete analysis of the Matou Production Team makes this even clearer. In the past, due to the problem of the leadership not taking action personally, the team members were unwilling to exert their energy, and the captain only held meetings and shouted his lungs out, but everyone was still not united. At that time, because the entire drought resistance and wheat watering front of the Matou Commune was very prosperous, the Matou Team was given the unpleasant name of "the dark spot under the lamp." Later, the first secretary of the commune Party Committee personally went to the team to serve as the "attending physician," and also conducted in-depth visits to the commune members, and also invited them to serve as "medical assistants" to help the team's leadership check for "problems"; and those being checked did not "avoid medical treatment for their illnesses," and were able to honestly and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and in accordance with the instructions of the superiors, "acted as both commander and soldier," becoming an example for the masses in everything. As a result, all the team members immediately became energized, and their enthusiasm was like a deflated leather ball being filled with air again, and they jumped and danced in the wheat fields to fight. The team members said happily: "Don't look at us lagging behind, all the generals are going into battle, and the soldiers have aimed their energy, so what are we worried about not catching up with the advanced!" Sure enough, the latecomers surpassed the former. The labor force invested by this team surged from fifty-seven people to more than three hundred, and the daily progress of wheat watering soared, from nine mu to sixty-four mu, not only did it not lag behind, but it also completed the task ahead of schedule, and the "dark spot under the lamp" stepped into the ranks of the advanced.
    The experience of the Matou Commune gives us an inspiration: the mass line is the fundamental line of all the Party's work. If this line is not earnestly implemented, the work will not be done well, or even mistakes will be made. And if this line is implemented, all work can be done well.

    带着群众干
  　陈实
    中共河北省委发出“动员全党全民，紧急行动起来，投入防旱抗旱斗争，千方百计消灭春旱”的战斗号召以后，河北交河县码头人民公社党委立即召开了干部飞行会议，研究部署行动计划。
    这个计划，对如何坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭旱魔，采取了一系列措施。关于领导方法，公社党委书记说：“要亲自动手，做出样子，带着群众干”。于是，“把办公室搬到田间，使指挥员又成社员”就成了措施的重要一条。党委还号召大家尽可能不穿皮鞋，这样更方便同社员打成一片。帅令下达，一呼百应，从公社、管理区到生产队的脱产干部，都能见之于实行。这说明，咱们党联系群众、艰苦奋斗的优良传统，已经深入人心，并不断在发扬光大。
    数天后，有两个同志围绕“禁令”发起议论来。甲说：“脱下笨重的皮鞋，换上结实的千层底，怪轻松哩！”乙听了说：“脱皮鞋，可不是生活小事，意义深着呐！”甲接着说：“论意义，俺看有三点：第一，轻装下乡，便于深入地发现问题；第二，参加劳动，能够细致地体会问题；第三，田间办公，可以及时地解决问题。”乙补充道：“叫俺看还有两个作用：群众的监督和批评，对工作有很大推动作用，俺们的行动，对群众的进步有很大的鼓舞作用。”人们共同的评价是：“把办公室搬到田间，使指挥员又成社员”的方针是完全正确的。为什么？一则，它能够有效地保证取得工作的胜利；再则，倘若原定的计划部分地或全部地不合于实际，遇到挫折，碰了钉子，又便于及时改正，然后按正确的去做，使计划得以实现。
    经过领导深入群众、深入第一线后，码头人民公社抗旱浇麦的进度，扶摇直上，而且质量好，被评为交河县二十三个公社中的上游。再具体剖析一下码头生产队，就更清楚。过去，这个队由于存在领导不能亲自动手的毛病，社员有劲也不愿使出来，队长光指着开开会，喊破了嗓子，大伙仍旧不齐心。当时，因为码头公社整个抗旱浇麦战线都很红火，所以码头队就落个不好听的名誉，叫做“灯下黑”。后来，公社党委第一书记亲自到这个队去担任“主治医生”，并且深入访问了社员，也请他们担任“医助”，来帮助这个队的领导检查“毛病”；而被检查者又不“讳疾忌医”，能老老实实虚心听取群众意见，按照上级指示，“又当司令又当兵”，事事成为群众的表率。这样一来，全队的社员立即精神振作，干劲像瘪了的皮球又鼓足了气，欢蹦乱跳地在麦田里大战起来。社员们高兴地说：“别看咱后进，当将军的全上阵啦，当兵的劲儿都瞄足啦，还愁啥追不上先进呢！”果然，后来者居上。这个队投入的劳力，由五十七人猛增到三百多人，浇麦日进度展翅高飞，由九亩跃到六十四亩，不但没落后，反而提前完成任务，“灯下黑”跨入了先进行列。
    码头公社的经验给了我们启示：群众路线，是党的一切工作的根本路线。不认真贯彻这一路线，工作就做不好，甚或会犯错误。而贯彻了这条路线，一切工作都能做得好。
