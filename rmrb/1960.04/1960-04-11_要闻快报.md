    Zhejiang Vigorously Develops Intercropping in Forest Land
    Various parts of Zhejiang are making full use of mountainous areas to vigorously develop intercropping and mixed cropping in forest land. As of the end of March, the province had intercropped grain, oil crops, and forage crops in 1.46 million mu of young forest land for oil tea, tung oil trees, tea, and mulberry, which is 260,000 mu more than the total area intercropped last year.
    Intercropping in forest land can not only increase agricultural production but also play a nurturing role for young forests, promoting rapid growth and high yields of trees. It can also accelerate the development of commune economies and increase the income of commune members. There are approximately 7 million mu of forest land suitable for intercropping in Zhejiang Province. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this work. The CPC Tiantai County Committee has designated intercropping in forest land as an important component of current agricultural production, deploying it at all levels and launching a mass movement, achieving brilliant results in intercropping.
    Shanxi Mobilizes 500,000 People for Emergency Prevention and Control of Wheat Rust
    People's communes in wheat-producing areas of Shanxi Province have organized an army of more than 500,000 people to fight wheat diseases and insect pests, launching a comprehensive survey and control campaign.
    According to surveys in various areas, wheat rust has occurred to varying degrees in twelve counties and cities across the province. The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee requires all areas to make rust investigation and eradication work regular and systematic, launching a mass campaign for rust eradication from early April to early May, achieving immediate investigation and treatment, treating when diseased, preventing when healthy, skillfully attacking and comprehensively encircling and suppressing the disease to ensure a bumper wheat harvest.
      Hebei Promotes Low-Pressure Steam Water Pump
    Hebei Province is actively promoting low-pressure steam water pumps in the fight against drought. This type of steam water pump only requires two to three atmospheres of pressure to lift water for irrigation (general locomotive boilers require five to six atmospheres to lift water), and it has more advantages than using a locomotive boiler to drive a water pump: (1) Simple structure and saves steel. A low-pressure steam water pump only needs 375 kilograms of cast iron and 25 kilograms of steel, and can be manufactured by general commune repair shops. (2) Fuel can be obtained locally, not only coal but also firewood and thatch can be burned. (3) Large water output, irrigating about 20 mu of land per day and night.
    The low-pressure steam water pump was originally trial-produced by the Baishousi Commune in Cixian County, and later improved by Xinle County, giving it more advantages.
        Qinghai Province Eliminates Six Pests
    Qinghai Province has mobilized hundreds of thousands of people every day since April 5th, closely integrated with production, vigorously publicizing, creating momentum, and eliminating "six pests" (rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas), and emphasizing hygiene. According to incomplete statistics, from the 5th to the 8th, a total of more than 810,000 rats and a large number of flies, fly pupae, bedbugs, mosquitoes, lice, and fleas were eliminated. More than 61,000 toilets and 23,000 livestock pens were built and improved, and a large amount of garbage was cleared, giving the urban and rural areas a new look.
    In this spring patriotic health mass movement, all areas have implemented the policy of starting from production, cooperating with production, and serving production, and the production army is also an army for eliminating pests and diseases.

    要闻快报
    浙江大搞林地套种
    浙江各地充分利用山地，大搞林地间作套种。截至3月底，全省在油茶、油桐、茶桑等幼林地内套种了粮食、油料和饲料作物一百四十六万亩，比去年全年套种面积还多二十六万亩。
    林地套种，不仅能增产农产品，还能对幼林起到抚育的作用，促进林木速生丰产；也能更快地发展公社经济，增加社员收入。浙江省可供套种的林地大约有七百万亩左右。各级党委十分重视这项工作。中共天台县委确定林地套种作为当前农业生产的重要内容，并层层部署，大搞群众运动，套种成绩辉煌。	  山西五十万人突击防治麦锈病
    山西省产麦区各人民公社，组织五十多万人扑灭小麦病虫害的大军，已展开普查普治活动。
    据各地调查，目前全省已有十二个县、市，程度不同发生了小麦锈病。山西省人民委员会要求各地把查锈、灭锈工作做到经常化、制度化，从4月上旬到5月初开展群众性的灭锈突击运动，做到随查随治，有病就治，无病就防，巧打猛攻，全面围剿，保证小麦大丰收。
      河北推广低压蒸汽水车
    河北省在抗旱运动中积极推广低压蒸汽水车。这种蒸汽水车只需要二至三个气压即可提水浇灌（一般锅驼机则需要五至六个气压才能提水），它比用锅驼机带动水车有更多的优点：（一）构造简单，节省钢材，一台低压蒸汽水车只需铸铁三百七十五公斤，钢材二十五公斤，一般公社修配厂均可制造。（二）燃料可以就地取材，不仅能用煤，而且木柴、茅柴都可以烧。（三）出水量大，一昼夜能浇地二十亩左右。
    低压蒸汽水车原是磁县柏寿寺公社试制成功的，后来又经新乐县加以研究改进，使其具备了更多的优点。
        青海省大除六害
    青海省从4月5日起，每天出动上百万人，紧密结合生产，大张旗鼓、大造声势、大除“六害”（老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子、虱子、跳蚤），大讲卫生。据不完全统计，从5日到8日的四天内，共消灭了八十一万多只老鼠，和大量的苍蝇、蝇蛹以及臭虫、蚊子、虱子、跳蚤。修建和改良厕所六万一千多个、牲畜棚圈两万三千多个，清除了大量的垃圾，使城乡面貌焕然一新。
    在这次春季爱国卫生的群众运动中，各地都贯彻执行了从生产出发、配合生产、为生产服务的方针，生产大军同时是除害灭病大军。
