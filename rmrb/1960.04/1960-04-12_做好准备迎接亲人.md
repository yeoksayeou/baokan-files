Make good preparations to welcome relatives

Liang Jinshan Huang Dingchen Huang Changshui Wang Yuanxing Zhou Zheng representative of the joint statement of Tian Xin Wang Jiyuan Wang Yizhi Committee

State-owned Overseas Chinese Farms are comprehensive farms. Only through such comprehensive development and utilization can the farms develop rapidly, better, and more economically, better arrange the labor of returning overseas Chinese, so that they can each find their place and give full play to their positive factors. Chairman, fellow committee members:

We listened with excitement and enthusiasm to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960." These two reports presented us with a magnificent picture of the motherland continuing to leap forward. We fully agree with and support these two reports, and agree with the work report made by the Standing Committee.

In order to deeply understand the placement of returned overseas Chinese and the construction and development of overseas Chinese farms, we inspected more than 30 various types of overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi and other provinces (autonomous regions). Like industry and agriculture across the country, the situation in overseas Chinese farms everywhere is one of a great leap forward, with very significant achievements. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the returned overseas Chinese placed in overseas Chinese farms everywhere, like the people of the whole country, are displaying soaring enthusiasm to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Overseas Chinese farms everywhere are demonstrating their characteristics of diversified operations, with tropical and subtropical crops as the mainstay, combining long-term and short-term crops, in the great construction cause of the motherland. In collective labor, the ideological awareness of the returned overseas Chinese has been rapidly improved. This is part of the great victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and it is a glorious victory of Chairman Mao Zedong's wise leadership.

Now, we will express some opinions on the issues related to the placement of returned overseas Chinese and farm construction that we encountered during our inspection of the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm, and we ask for your comments.

Anyone who has visited the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island has been deeply impressed by the rich tropical and subtropical economic crop garden created by the returned overseas Chinese under the leadership of the Party, relying on their own labor. However, before liberation, this fertile hillside area, stretching for dozens of kilometers and undulating, was devastated for a long time by the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese invaders. As a result, only a few households remained in Xinglong Town when it was first liberated, and only a few lights were lit at night. It was truly a scene of "ten thousand households desolate, ghosts singing"! Starting in October 1951, more than 700 displaced overseas Chinese who were persecuted and returned from Malaya, with a strong determination to build the motherland, were placed on this piece of land to be reclaimed under the leadership of the Party and the government to carry out reclamation and build farms. They displayed the spirit of diligence, bravery, perseverance, and fearlessness, and started from scratch there, building houses, planting crops, opening up roads, and establishing factories. They encountered one natural disaster after another, and each time they overcame the disaster and achieved a bumper harvest with the leadership and support of the Party and the government. Now the farm has become a socialist enterprise with more than 7,000 people and wealth everywhere. At present, this farm is busy receiving new returning overseas Chinese. A batch of new houses have been built along the Sun River, and a great upsurge in production has been launched. In that tropical and subtropical garden, fruits are everywhere, fragrant and fragrant, and there are more than 100 kinds of economic crops planted, such as citronella, coffee, cocoa, pepper, bananas, pineapples, sisal hemp, oil palm, and kapok. In just seven or eight years (as of November 1959), 45,972 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, of which 24,164 mu have been planted with long-term tropical crops, 20,959 mu with short-term crops, and 9,208 mu with grain crops, and other oil crops and vegetables have been planted. This year, we strive to double the amount and reclaim another 40,000 to 60,000 mu of wasteland. Animal husbandry and aquaculture have also been continuously developed. The farm has built more than 200 kilometers of roads, and the roads are crisscrossed and accessible in all directions. In terms of industry, there are 20 items such as coffee, sisal hemp processing, bricks and tiles, lime, chemical fertilizer, citronella oil, condensed milk, starch, brewing, and oil extraction. In the past, malaria was prevalent in this area, and there were as many as 19 species of mosquitoes. Since the establishment of the farm, with the strong help of the Party and the government and Soviet experts, malaria has been fundamentally eliminated. In terms of cultural, educational and welfare undertakings, the number of primary and middle school students in the farm has increased from 126 in 1952 to 1,472 in 1959. In addition, there are radio stations, theater troupes, health centers, homes for the elderly, nurseries, and so on. Since 1958, encouraged by the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, the development of the farm has entered a new stage. Many factories were established and developed during this period. The total industrial and agricultural output value in 1958 reached more than 2.88 million yuan. 1959 was a year of continued leap forward. A total of more than 16,500 mu of wasteland was reclaimed throughout the year, and the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 4,310,640 yuan.

The development of production at the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm shows that the establishment of state-owned overseas Chinese farms by the Party and the government as bases for the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese and production and construction is a completely correct policy of mainly centralized placement.

Due to the continuous development of production, the living standards of the farm members have gradually improved. Calculated on the basis of labor force, the annual income of each labor force in 1959 reached 471 yuan. The returned overseas Chinese have returned from abroad and have established happy homes and are living a happy life on the farm. For example, Comrade Chen Jingmei, a worker in the citronella processing plant, was only fifteen years old when she came to the farm in 1951. She studied culture at the farm and became a skilled worker. She established a happy family in 1954 and now has two lovely children. Comrade Xiao Ying, a labor model, was a child bride in Malaya. Later, she worked as a rubber tapper in a rubber plantation. Her life was destitute. She painfully sold a child, but still could not change her life of hunger and cold. When she returned to China, Comrade Xiao Ying was still illiterate. Now, under the cultivation of the Party and the government, she can read newspapers and write simple reports, and has been selected as the deputy director of the work area leading more than 1,000 people in production. This is simply a miracle in the capitalist world, but in our country, thousands of such miracles appear every day and every hour. Now there are more than 1,000 production experts in the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm, including 368 advanced workers and more than 200 people serving as work area directors, captains, accountants and custodians. This shows that our country has soil for cultivating heroic figures everywhere. The returned overseas Chinese returned to the great motherland and, under the cultivation of the Party and the government, are an active force in socialist construction.

As far as we know, based on the experience of the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Committee plans to build and expand 20 larger state-owned overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangxi this year, each capable of accommodating 10,000 to 50,000 people. These farms will be built into gardens for returned overseas Chinese to settle down and participate in the construction of the motherland. After returning to the motherland, the overseas Chinese can be relatively concentrated together according to their situation and wishes of being neighbors abroad, and work together for a common cause and create a happy life together. At the same time, this also makes it easier for the Party and the government to better help them live and build in the country, facilitate the arrangement of their work, help them learn production knowledge, give play to their skills and enthusiasm for building the motherland. These 20 farms are mostly selected in: (1) tropical and subtropical areas in the south with convenient transportation; (2) convenient for developing diversified operations; (3) adjacent to state-owned farms and people's communes, which can support each other; (4) have conditions for building water conservancy projects. At present, the expanded and newly built state-owned overseas Chinese farms are under active construction, and some farms have placed a group of newly returned overseas Chinese. After arriving at the farm, the returned overseas Chinese also actively participated in the construction of the farm with the attitude of masters. For example, Mr. Zhang Fengnan, who recently returned from Indonesia, went up the mountain to observe the environment and study the soil every morning after arriving at the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm. He is determined to plant 10,000 pepper plants on the farm and prepare to dedicate his lifelong technical experience in planting pepper to the motherland. Some newly returned overseas Chinese just put down their luggage and built houses with the old farm members. Although the country has prepared the necessary conditions for the returned overseas Chinese, they do not want to sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. They understand that it is the happiest thing to create life through their own labor and to build the motherland through their own labor.

According to our inspection, the management policy of overseas Chinese farms should draw on the experience of the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm and carry out diversified operations. Combining short-term and long-term benefits, both planting tropical and subtropical crops and planting grain, fully developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and at the same time developing processing industry and industry in many aspects, and establishing primary schools, middle schools, and secondary technical schools for planting tropical and subtropical crops. Therefore, state-owned overseas Chinese farms are comprehensive farms. We believe that only through such comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization can the farms develop faster, better, and more economically, and better arrange the labor of overseas Chinese so that they can each find their place and give full play to their positive factors. We believe that the construction of farms should also be carried out while reclaiming wasteland, producing, settling down, building, accumulating, and expanding, and strive for high-speed development of production.

It should be pointed out that the initial return of overseas Chinese, especially those living in Indonesia, has been greatly affected by the anti-China and anti-Chinese tide launched by the powerful groups in Indonesia, and they have encountered great difficulties. In the early stage of their return to China, most of them could not master production technology very well. Within a certain period of time, it is necessary for the government to lead them to participate in production and provide them with appropriate living subsidies. Doing so is beneficial to the construction and development of farms and to the settlement and employment of returned overseas Chinese. The prospects of these farms are very bright. They are not only a place for overseas Chinese to show their talents in the socialist construction of the motherland, but also their hometown, school, and classroom, and a bright road for overseas Chinese to embark on socialism after returning to the motherland.

Fellow committee members, comrades: In order to do a good job in receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese, the State Council has issued a clear order to establish the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China. Under the unified leadership of this agency, local party and government departments are vigorously doing a good job in receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese. We believe that in the near future, in the land of southern China where thousands of purples and reds are blooming and hundreds of flowers are competing for beauty, in the places where overseas Chinese once separated from their wives and children and left their homes, many farms that are richer and more beautiful than the Xinglong State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm will be established, creating a happier life, and countless advanced producers and red flag bearers will continue to emerge, making active contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    做好准备迎接亲人
    梁金山  黄鼎臣  黄长水  王源兴  周铮代表和田心  王纪元  王一知委员的联合发言
    国营华侨农场是综合性的农场。这样综合发展综合利用，农场才能多快好省地发展，才能更好地安排归侨的劳动，使他们各得其所，充分发挥他们的积极因素。主席、各位委员：
    我们以兴奋热烈的心情，聆听了李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，这两个报告把祖国一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的图画展现在我们的面前。我们完全同意和拥护这两个报告，并同意常务委员会所作的工作报告。
    我们为了深入了解关于归国华侨安置工作和华侨农场建设、发展的情况，这次到广东、福建、广西等省（自治区）视察了三十多个各种类型的华侨农场，各地华侨农场同全国工农业一样，是一日千里大跃进的形势，成绩是十分显著的。安置在各地华侨农场的归国华侨，在党和政府的领导下，同全国人民一样，正发挥冲天的干劲，参加祖国的社会主义建设，各地华侨农场在祖国伟大的建设事业中正显示出它的以种植热带、亚热带作物为主的多种经营、长期作物和短期作物并举的特点。在集体劳动中，归国华侨的思想觉悟，得到了迅速的提高。这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社伟大胜利的一部分，是毛泽东主席英明领导的光辉的胜利。
    现在我们就视察国营兴隆华侨农场中所接触的有关归侨安置和农场建设问题，发表一些意见，请各位委员指正。
    凡是到过海南岛国营兴隆华侨农场参观的人，都为归侨在党的领导下，凭着自己的双手劳动创造起来的富饶的热带、亚热带经济作物花园，留下了深刻的印象。但是，在解放前，这一片连绵数十公里，蜿蜒起伏的肥沃的山坡地区，由于国民党反动派和日寇长期摧残的结果，到刚解放时，兴隆镇上只剩下几户人家，夜间只有寥寥的几家灯火。真是“万户萧疏鬼唱歌”！1951年10月起，从马来亚被迫害归国的七百多名难侨，带着一颗建设祖国的顽强决心，在党和政府的领导下，安置他们在这块待开垦的土地上进行垦植，建设农场。他们发挥了勤劳、勇敢和坚毅、无畏的精神，在那里白手起家，盖起了房屋，种植了作物，开辟了公路，建立了工厂，他们遭遇到一次又一次的自然灾害，每一次都在党和政府领导支持下，战胜了灾害，取得了丰收。现在农场已成为一个拥有七千多人和遍地财富的社会主义企业了。目前这个农场正在繁忙的接待新归国华侨。太阳河畔已新建起一批批的房屋，并掀起生产的大高潮。在那热带、亚热带的大花园里，到处是果实累累，芬芳扑鼻，种植的经济作物有香茅、咖啡、可可、胡椒、香蕉、波萝、剑麻、油棕、木棉等一百余种。在短短的七、八年间（截至1959年11月止），已开荒四万五千九百七十二亩，其中定植长期热带作物二万四千一百六十四亩，短期作物二万零九百五十九亩，种植粮食九千二百零八亩，其他种植油料作物，蔬菜等。今年争取翻一番，再垦荒四至六万亩。畜牧业、水产业也有了不断的发展。农场已修筑公路二百余公里，全场公路纵横、四通八达。工业方面，有咖啡、剑麻加工、砖瓦、石灰、化肥、香茅油、炼奶、淀粉、酿酒、榨油等二十项。过去这一带地方疟疾流行，疟蚊多至十九种。建场以来，在党和政府以及苏联专家的大力帮助下，已根本上消灭了疟病。在文教福利事业方面，农场的中小学生，已由1952年的一百二十六人增加到1959年的一千四百七十二人。另外还有广播站、剧团、卫生院、敬老院、托儿所等等。1958年以来，在大跃进新形势的鼓舞下，农场的发展跨进了一个新的阶段。许多工厂都是在这一期间创办和发展起来的。1958年的工农业总产值达到二百八十八万余元。1959年是继续跃进的一年，全年开荒一万六千五百多亩，工农业总产值达到四百三十一万零六百四十元。
    从国营兴隆华侨农场生产的发展说明，党和政府建立国营华侨农场，作为安置归侨、生产建设的基地，这种集中为主的安置方针，是完全正确的。
    由于生产的不断发展，农场场员生活逐步有了提高，按劳动力计算，1959年每个劳动力全年收入达到四百七十一元。归国华侨从国外回来，已在农场建立起幸福的家园，过着美满的生活。例如香茅加工厂工人陈经妹同志，1951年到农场时才十五岁，在农场学习了文化，成了熟练工人，1954年建立了幸福的家庭，现在已经有了两个可爱的孩子。如劳动模范萧英同志，在马来亚是一个童养媳，后来在橡胶园当割胶工，生活无着，曾忍痛卖掉一个孩子，依然不能改变那饥寒交迫的生活。回国时，萧英同志还是一个文盲，现在在党和政府的培养下，已能读报，写简单的报告，并且被选拔为领导一千多人生产的作业区副主任了。这在资本主义世界，简直是奇迹，而在我们国家，每日每时都有千千万万这样的奇迹出现。现在国营兴隆华侨农场的生产能手就有一千多人，其中有三百六十八个先进工作者，有二百多人担任作业区主任、队长、会计员和保管员。这说明了我们国家到处有培养英雄人物的土壤，归国华侨回到伟大的祖国，在党和政府的培养下，是一支社会主义建设的积极力量。
    据我们所知道的，根据国营兴隆华侨农场的经验，中央华侨事务委员会准备今年在广东、福建、云南、广西新建和扩建二十个每个可以容纳一万至五万人规模较大的国营华侨农场，把这些农场建设成为归国华侨安家和参加祖国建设的园地。使华侨回到祖国后，可以按照他们在国外左右为邻的情况和愿望，比较集中的安置在一起，为着共同的事业，一同劳动，一同创造幸福的生活。同时，这也便于党和政府更好地帮助他们在国内生活和建设，便于安排他们的工作，帮助他们学习生产知识，发挥他们的技能和建设祖国的积极性。这二十个农场大都选择在：（1）南方热带、亚热带交通便利的地区；（2）便利发展多种经营；（3）与国营农场、人民公社为邻，可以互相支援；（4）有修建水利条件的。目前扩建和新建的国营华侨农场都正在积极建设中，有的农场，已安置一批新归国的华侨。归国华侨到达农场以后，也以主人翁的态度，积极参加了农场的建设。如最近从印度尼西亚回来的张凤南老先生，到了国营兴隆华侨农场后，每天清晨上山察看环境，研究土质，他决心在农场种植一万株胡椒，准备将他一生种植胡椒的技术经验献给祖国。有的新归国华侨刚放下行装，就与老场员一起建筑房屋。虽然国家给归国华侨准备着必要的条件，他们并不想去坐享其成，他们明白：通过自己的劳动来创造生活，通过自己的劳动来建设祖国，才是最幸福的。
    根据我们视察所得，华侨农场的经营方针，应当吸取国营兴隆华侨农场的经验，多种经营。以短养长，长短并举，既种植热带、亚热带作物，又种植粮食，充分发展农、林、牧、副、渔各业，同时多方面发展加工业、工业，并且创办小学、中学以及为种植热带、亚热带作物的中等技术学校。因此，国营华侨农场是综合性的农场。我们认为这样综合发展，综合利用，农场才能多快好省地发展，才能更好地安排归侨的劳动，使他们各得其所，充分发挥他们的积极因素，我们认为农场的建设，还应当是边开荒、边生产、边安置、边建设、边积累、边扩大，争取高速度的发展生产。
    应该指出，华侨初回国，特别是居住在印度尼西亚的华侨，由于印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起反华、排华逆潮的影响，他们所遭遇的困难是很大的，在他们回国初期，大部分不能很好的掌握生产技术，在一定时间内，政府既要领导他们参加生产，又给予他们以适当的生活补助是必要的。这样做对农场的建设和发展，对归国华侨的安居乐业都是有利的。这些农场的前景是十分美好的，它既是归侨为祖国社会主义建设大显身手的园地，又是他们的家乡、学校和课堂，是华侨回到祖国以后走向社会主义的一条光明大道。
    各位委员，各位同志：为了作好接待和安置归国华侨的工作，国务院已明令公布：成立中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会，在这一机构的统一领导下，各地党政部门正大力做好接待和安置归国华侨的工作。我们相信，在不久的将来，在祖国南方万紫千红、百花竞放的土地上，在过去华侨别妻离子，背井离乡的地方，将建立起比国营兴隆华侨农场更富饶、更美好的许多农场，创造更幸福的生活，并将不断涌现出无数的先进生产者和红旗手，在祖国的社会主义建设中作出积极的贡献。
