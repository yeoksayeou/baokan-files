Skillfully Stirring Up Spring Plowing
By Our Reporter Liu Guanghui

	The busy season of spring plowing has arrived in Jiangkou Commune, Gan County, Jiangxi Province. On the roads leading to the fields, handcarts, ox carts, and wheelbarrows carrying fertilizer and seedlings come and go continuously. More than thirty members of the Assault Team of the Hantang Brigade, driving handcarts each loaded with six dan (approximately 300 kilograms) of fertilizer, dash forward with one person pushing each cart. Upon reaching the field, with a simple turn, they deftly press down on the cart shafts, causing the wheels to slide out and up like a scorpion's tail, cleanly and neatly dumping the entire load of fertilizer into the field.

	In the fields, commune members are operating "Jiangxi 59 type" rice transplanters. Standing behind the transplanters, they grip the handle and gently pull, and five seedling grippers simultaneously insert seedlings into the mud. In the blink of an eye, five rice seedlings are planted, with uniform row spacing and plant spacing, and each seedling is the same size and evenly spaced. Commune members Yang Bangqi and Wang Pingying were renowned manual rice planting experts in the Jiangkou Brigade in the past, but they could only plant one mu (approximately 0.16 acres) of rice per day, and they would be left with aching backs and legs. Now, operating the transplanters, they can plant eight or nine mu of rice per day without feeling tired, making them sing mountain songs with joy:

	"The rice transplanter is so capable, one push and one pull plants five seedlings. The row and plant size is as precise as if drawn by a pen, no bending over, no blurred vision, fast and good, absolutely top-notch!"

	Working with new tools here is truly endless to see and talk about. In addition to rice transplanters and transportation vehicles, there are deep plows for plowing, improved harrows and leaping forward harrows for harrowing, ox-drawn fertilizer spreaders for spreading fertilizer, field ridge levelers for leveling field ridges, as well as peanut and cotton sowing machines. In the canteens and agricultural product processing factories, there are material dividers, pulverizers, automatic rice milling machines, automatic oil presses, and more than ten other types of new tools. Currently, the entire commune uses more than forty types and more than 30,000 pieces of new tools, covering all aspects of production and all major production processes. This not only reduces labor intensity but also increases work efficiency by two to twenty times. Due to the promotion and use of these advanced tools, the entire commune has saved 15,000 labor days, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of spring plowing and improving the quality of cultivation. To date, the commune's more than 27,000 mu of early rice fields have been prepared, with 5,000 mu already transplanted. The sowing of more than 10,000 mu of cash crops and miscellaneous grains has been basically completed, and all production activities are ahead of schedule compared to previous years. The quality has reached the high standards of fine plowing and harrowing, sufficient base fertilizer, tender and strong seedlings, high-quality transplanting, and reasonable dense planting, making it a red flag for high-speed and high-quality spring plowing production in the entire county.

	Jiangkou Commune has a large land area but a small population, with each laborer responsible for an average of ten mu of land, and labor has always been tight. This year, the commune conscientiously implements the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," and plans to expand the area sown to early rice, miscellaneous grains, and cash crops in the spring by more than 5,000 mu compared to last year. Other forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and industrial production are all required to develop exponentially. This requires more labor than in previous years; however, due to supporting national industrial construction, the actual labor force of the entire commune has decreased by more than 300 compared to last year. Therefore, the difficulty of insufficient labor this year is becoming increasingly prominent. As a result, since last winter, the commune party committee has launched a large-scale technical innovation movement among commune members to vigorously reform tools. Through the efforts of last winter and this spring, the entire commune created and reformed more than seventy types of tools and manufactured more than 40,000 pieces. The commune party committee adopted the method of simultaneous trial production, manufacturing, and promotion, and promptly promoted the created and improved new tools in the spring plowing campaign, thus achieving outstanding results of both fast and good spring plowing production with less labor than in previous years.

	Before promoting the use of advanced tools, the Jiangkou Commune Party Committee extensively carried out publicity and education, mobilizing commune members to actively use advanced tools. Initially, some people emphasized trial production but not promotion, saying, "Trial production is okay, but widespread promotion will have to be done slowly," and they did not dare to boldly promote the newly developed tools that had been successfully trialed. In response to this idea, the commune party committee, on the one hand, organized commune members to carry out discussions, and through calculating labor accounts and new tool use accounts, made commune members realize that solving the difficulty of insufficient labor this year is to universally promote the use of new tools and give full play to the role of new tools; on the other hand, the commune party committee, through publicity, pointed out to commune members that only creating but not promoting would not give play to the role of new tools, and no results would be achieved in production, and it would be difficult to promote the continued development of the technical innovation movement. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp both creation and promotion, to quickly promote production and constantly promote the technical innovation movement. At the same time, the commune party committee took the Hantang Brigade as a pilot for promoting advanced tools, experimenting and demonstrating the use of advanced tools here, and organizing cadres and commune members to visit in rotation, using on-site facts to educate everyone. Through organizing discussions, publicity, and demonstrations, people's thinking was raised, everyone loved new tools, and everyone was happy to use new tools, which laid a good ideological foundation for the universal promotion of new tools.

	One of the important links in promoting the use of new tools is to universally impart the technology of operating new tools to the masses. To this end, the Jiangkou Commune adopted the method of simultaneous promotion and training, using various methods to impart the technology and experience of using new tools to commune members throughout the commune. First, the commune and various production teams combined cultural learning and opened more than ten technical night schools and red and expert schools, with technicians lecturing, and studying three nights a week. A total of more than 5,000 people throughout the commune were organized to enroll in the schools. Secondly, since this spring, the commune and the major brigades have successively opened more than 20 short-term technical training classes, imparting the technology of using new tools such as rice transplanters, sowing machines, and ox carts to more than 4,000 commune members. Third, extensive visits were organized, and on-site meetings were held, both to learn technology and to liberate thinking. Fourth, the commune organized more than ten field roving guidance groups with the participation of technicians and experienced commune members, going deep into the fields to impart the technology of using new tools to commune members on the spot. Through the above methods, 15,000 commune members throughout the commune learned the technology of using two to thirty types of new tools, of which more than 5,000 commune members have become experts or all-rounders in operating new tools.

    巧闹春耕	本报记者　刘光辉
    春耕大忙季节，已经来到江西赣县江口公社。在通向田间的公路上和大道上，来往运送肥料、秧苗的手推车、牛拉车、单轮车接连不断。旱塘大队突击队的三十多名社员驾着手推车，每一部车子装运六担肥料，由一人推着飞跑，到了田边，只见人一转身，两手轻巧地把车辕往下一压，车轮就像蝎子翘尾巴一样滑出来、翘上去，把满满的一车肥料干净利落地倒在田里。
    田间，社员操纵着“江西59型”插秧机在插秧。他们站在插秧机的后边，手握住拉手架，轻轻一拉动，五个秧爬带着秧苗一齐伸入泥中，眨眼就插了五蔸秧，行距、株距一样宽窄，蔸蔸一样大小，十分均匀。社员杨邦奇、王平英是江口大队过去著名的手工插秧能手，但一天也只能插一亩秧，还累得腰酸腿痛。现在他们操纵着插秧机，一天插秧八、九亩，并不觉得劳累，乐得他们唱起山歌来：
  “插秧机本领大，一推一拉五株下，行株大小如笔划，不弯腰不眼花，又快又好顶呱呱！”
    用新工具劳动，在这里真是看不完说不尽。除了插秧机、运输车之外，犁田有深耕犁，耙田有改良耘、跃进耙，撒粪有牛拉撒粪器，整田埂有田埂烫平器，还有花生、棉花播种机；在食堂、农产品加工工厂，有分料机、粉碎机、自动碾米机、自动油榨等十多种新工具。现在全公社使用的新工具共有四十多种、三万多件，遍及各项生产、各个主要生产工序。这不仅减轻了劳动强度，而且两倍至二十多倍地提高了工效。由于推广使用这些先进工具，全社已节省了一万五千个劳动日，从而大大加速了春耕进度，提高了耕种质量。至今，这个社二万七千多亩早稻田都已整理就绪，已插秧的有五千亩；一万多亩经济作物和杂粮作物已基本结束播种，各项生产都比往年提早了一个节令。质量达到了犁耙精细、基肥充足、秧苗嫩壮、插秧优质、密植合理的高标准，成为全县春耕生产高速度、高质量的红旗。
    江口公社地多人少，平均每个劳力担负十亩田地，劳力一向紧张。今年公社认真贯彻“以粮为纲、全面跃进”方针，计划春季播种的早稻、杂粮和经济作物，要比去年扩大五千多亩，其他林、牧、副、渔和工业生产，都要求成倍发展。这就需要有比往年更多的劳力；而全社实有劳力由于支援国家工业建设，比去年反而减少了三百多个。因此，今年劳力不足的困难愈来愈突出。于是，公社党委从去冬以来就发动社员开展了巨大规模的技术革新运动，大力改革工具。经过去冬今春的努力，全社创制与改革了七十多种工具，制造了四万多件。公社党委采取边试制、边制造、边推广使用的办法，把创造与改良的新工具及时在春耕运动中推广使用，因而在劳力比往年少的情况下，取得了春耕生产既快又好的出色成绩。
    在推广使用先进工具前，江口公社党委广泛开展了宣传教育，发动社员积极使用先进工具。开始，有些人重试制不重推广，他们说“试制试制还可以，普遍推广就得慢慢来”，对试制成功的新工具不敢大胆推广。针对这一思想，公社党委一方面组织社员开展讨论，通过算劳力账、新工具使用账等，使社员认识到解决今年劳力不足的困难，是普遍推广使用新工具，充分发挥新工具的作用；另一方面，公社党委通过宣传，向社员们指出只创制、不推广，便不能发挥新工具的作用，在生产上得不到成效，也难以推动技术革新运动继续开展。因此必须一手抓创制，一手抓推广，既迅速推动生产，又不断推动技术革新运动。与此同时，公社党委又以旱塘大队为推广先进工具的试点，在这里试验、表演使用先进工具，组织干部、社员轮流参观，用现场事实教育大家。经过组织讨论、宣传、表演，提高了人们的思想，人人喜爱新工具，个个乐用新工具，这就为普遍推广新工具打下了良好的思想基础。
    推广使用新工具的重要环节之一，必须把操纵新工具的技术普遍传授给群众。为此，江口公社采取边推广、边训练的办法，运用多种方式向全社社员传授使用新工具的技术与经验。首先，公社、各生产队结合文化学习开办了十多所技术夜校、红专学校，由技术人员讲课，每周学习三个晚上。全社共组织了五千多人入校学习。其次，公社和各大队今春以来先后开办了二十多个短期技术训练班，向四千多名社员传授了使用插秧机、播种机、牛拉车等新工具的技术。第三，广泛组织参观，开现场会，既学习技术，又解放思想。第四，公社组织了十多个有技术人员和有经验的社员参加的田头巡回指导组，深入田间向社员现场传授使用新工具技术。通过上述办法，全社有一万五千名社员学会了使用两种至三十种新工具的技术，其中有五千多名社员已成为操纵新工具的能手或多面手。
