    Suzhou Silk Industry Vocational School is Advancing
    Speech by Committee Member Zheng Pijiang

    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I listened to the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the CPPCC Standing Committee, and I completely agree with it. I attended the National People's Congress as a non-voting delegate and listened to the draft report on the national economic plan by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. I wholeheartedly support them. Now I would like to discuss the development of the silk industry in the socialist construction of our motherland.

    Thanks to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the wise measures of the government, the socialist construction of our motherland has achieved victory after victory. Taking the silk industry as an example, under the government's vigorous call for developing the silk industry, the cocoon production in 1959 reached 1.6 million dan, which can produce 200,000 dan of silk, a doubling compared to the beginning of the liberation. Recently, the following measures have been taken to develop the silk industry:

    First, each province has newly planted mulberry trees, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of mu each year.

    Second, there has been a great leap forward in mulberry planting technology. During an inspection, I saw that the Chen Cai Commune Silk Farm in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, had a single yield of mulberry leaves of 106 dan per mu, and the mulberry trees planted in the same year also produced 100 dan of leaves per mu. The Zhuji Silk Vocational School in Paitou Town in the same county reclaimed 1,000 mu of barren mountains in 1957. The red soil part, after deep plowing and fertilization, produced 20 dan of leaves per mu in the same year, 50 dan of leaves per mu in 1959, and is striving for 100 dan in 1960. The black soil part produced 40 dan of leaves per mu in the planting year, 80 dan of leaves per mu in 1959, and is striving for 160 dan in 1960.

    Third, the quality of silkworm eggs has been improved, with the cocoon layer rate increasing to over 24%.

    Fourth, the people's communes have included sericulture into their agricultural plans, with specialized management, and have established sericulture farms.

    Fifth, in terms of technological innovation, various professional organizations and schools in sericulture and silk are launching a high tide of mechanization and automation of production tools.

    Sixth, in terms of sericulture education, all schools can implement the Party's education policy:
    One, strengthen political and ideological education and establish the concept of serving the proletariat.
    Two, reform the education plan and teaching syllabus.
    Three, integrate teaching with productive labor and scientific research.
    Four, adapt professional teaching materials.

    Thereby greatly improving the political ideology and teaching quality of teachers and students.

    Here is a report on how the Suzhou Silk Industry Vocational School has implemented the Party's education policy in the past two years:

    I. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the Party's education policy was resolutely implemented, ideological leadership was strengthened, bourgeois educational ideas were smashed, and the Party's comprehensive leadership over school work was developed to achieve educational revolution. Through the study of the vast number of teachers and students, a great debate was launched, and the academic ideas of the bourgeoisie, such as high yield and high quality cannot be achieved simultaneously, were systematically criticized. After education and struggle, the political and ideological awareness of the faculty and staff has been further improved. They can see the bright future of socialism and the great power of the people and firmly obey the leadership of the Party, consciously demanding ideological transformation and becoming intellectuals of the working class. At this point, the situation in the school was completely renewed. The whole Party and the whole school were united, working together with one heart and one mind, from top to bottom, to comprehensively improve the quality of education, and great leaps forward have been achieved on all fronts.

    II. Implement the policy of combining education with productive labor to improve the overall quality of education. Under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, all teachers and students in the school have become consciously demanding to participate in labor and transform their thinking, thereby incorporating labor into the education plan and establishing a new order of education. At the same time, the internship workshops were rectified and leadership was strengthened to become a base for the integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. According to the labor requirements of students in different grades, a syllabus for labor classes was formulated. In the students' labor, the political and ideological and technical leadership was strengthened, so that students can get a comprehensive improvement in ideological and moral character, theoretical knowledge, and technical operation. In labor, they can eat, live, and work with the workers, and can establish deep feelings with the workers, learn the excellent qualities of the working class, and accelerate the effect of training. In the past, it took six months to train a skilled worker, but now students can achieve the same level after only two months. There has also been a significant improvement in quality. The finished product pass rate in the silk weaving workshop has increased from 60% in the past to 92%, and there are new records of creating 100% or even achieving complete zero deduction. The product quality in the silk reeling workshop has been improved from AA grade to 4A grade. This year's first-year students, after entering the workshop for 25 days, actually reeled 8A grade raw silk from 3A grade raw cocoons. This is entirely due to the students' improved political ideology, taking responsibility for production, and setting off a new atmosphere of serious study, hard work, and in-depth research.

    III. Vigorously carry out scientific and technological research to improve the level of science, technology, and teaching, and promote the progress of production technology. In 1959, under the leadership of the Party committee, the policy of scientific and technological research oriented to teaching and combined with production was implemented, and teachers, students, workers, and technicians were organized to carry out mass scientific and technological research as a regular teaching activity, and to break through key points and drive the overall method, and carried out large-scale internal and external collaboration, and promoted the spirit of perseverance and fighting to the end. The achievements are huge.

    (1) In silk reeling, in order to realize mechanization and automation, after repeated experiments, the "Silk Special 59 Automatic So Li Xu Machine" was manufactured. Its production labor rate is 50% higher than the Japanese Domashi machine, and the reeling breakage is also relatively small. It has now been identified by the leadership and will be promoted and applied in Jiangsu after finalization, and 60 sets will be manufactured first for application in old factory transformation.

    (2) Recently, after rushing to work, the fixed-fineness sensor on the automatic silk reeling machine that has been tested for two years has achieved rapid sensing results and has been well received by all parties. It has been able to surpass the fixed-grain feeding device used in the Japanese automatic silk reeling machine. Currently, 400 ends are being manufactured and put into production testing, which will be presented as a gift to the cultural and educational system hero meeting.

    Such scientific and technological research combines theory and practice, basic technology and professional knowledge, teachers and students, and workers and technicians, laying a good foundation for further carrying out "high, precise, and advanced" technological revolution and improving teaching quality in the future.

    IV. Vigorously carry out teaching material innovation: In the past, teachers rarely participated in actual production, so there were many places where they were divorced from reality, and they were limited by the bourgeois world outlook, and their content was inevitably stale and backward, lacking ideological, scientific, and systematic qualities. Since the organization of teachers, students, workers, and technicians to jointly compile teaching materials under the leadership of the Party, the education revolution has been deepened into the teaching materials. At present, four kinds of higher and secondary professional teaching materials have been compiled. At the same time, teachers have greatly improved their professional level and accelerated the training of young teachers in the process of participating in the compilation of teaching materials, which is indeed a major achievement of the education revolution.

    The above situation is due to the leadership of the Party, the political command of the masses, and the conscious exertion of active forces, which have achieved rapid progress in wave after wave. There is no problem with the large-scale increase in the production quality of sericulture in the shortest period of time, but cocoon is only the raw material of silk, and its processing equipment must be prepared as soon as possible to meet the large-scale increase in production, and mechanization and automation must be promoted as soon as possible, and "high, precise, and advanced" technology research must be carried out to improve product quality and labor productivity at the same time. In addition, in terms of the nature of silk raw material production, how to design the silk manufacturing industry of the people's communes, such as the training of technical talents, the matching of raw materials and factory scale, the planning of equipment, the standards adopted by machinery, and the system of business management, should also be studied as soon as possible to adapt to the needs of continued great leaps forward.

    The above is my speech, if there is anything inappropriate, I am very shallow, please correct me, fellow committee members.

    苏州丝绸工业专科学校在前进
    郑辟疆委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了陈叔通政协副主席的常委会的工作报告，非常同意，列席人大会议听了李富春副总理的国家经济计划草案报告，和李先念副总理的1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，我衷心拥护，我现在就祖国的社会主义建设中，关于蚕丝业发展情况陈述如下。
    祖国的社会主义建设，由于党和毛主席的领导，政府的英明措施，已节节获得胜利，仅就蚕丝业一端言之，在政府的大力发展蚕丝业的号召下，1959年产茧量，达一百六十万担，可以制造丝绸二十万担，比解放之初，已增长了一倍，在最近对发展蚕丝业的措施，已有如下的情况：
    第一，各省新栽桑树，每年各以数万亩至数十万亩计。
    第二，栽桑技术大跃进，在视察中见到浙江省诸暨县，陈蔡公社蚕桑场，每亩单产桑叶，达一百零六担，并且当年扦插的桑树，每亩产叶，亦有一百担，同县牌头镇诸暨蚕桑专科学校，1957年开垦荒山一千亩，其中红土部分，经深耕丰肥后，栽植桑树，当年每亩产叶二十担，1959年产叶五十担，1960年争取一百担，黑土部分，栽植当年，每亩产叶四十担，1959年产叶八十担，1960年争取一百六十担。
    第三，蚕种质量，在茧层率方面，已有提高到24％以上。
    第四，人民公社方面，已将蚕桑列入农业规划，专业管理，并且有建立了蚕桑场的。
    第五，技术革新方面，蚕桑丝绸各专业机关和学校，对生产工具，正掀起机械化自动化的高潮。
    第六，蚕丝教育方面，各校都能贯彻党的教育方针，
    一、加强政治思想教育，树立为无产阶级服务观点。
    二、改革了教育计划和教学大纲。
    三、教学结合生产劳动和科学研究。
    四、改编了专业教材。
    从而大大提高了师生的政治思想和教学质量。
    兹就苏州丝绸工业专科学校，两年来，执行党的教育方针的经过，汇报如下：
    一、省、市委领导下，坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，乃加强思想领导，粉碎了资产阶级的教育思想，开展党对学校工作的全面领导，达成教育革命，经过广大师生的学习，发动了大鸣大放大辩论，系统的批判了资产阶级的学术思想，如高产高质不能并进等，通过教育和斗争后，教工的政治思想觉悟，获得进一步的提高，能看清社会主义的光明前途，和人民群众的伟大力量，坚定服从了党的领导，自觉的要求思想改造，成为工人阶级的知识分子，至此校中的局面顿然一新，全党全校，团结一致，同心协力，上下一贯，为全面提高教育质量而努力，各条战线，都取得了大跃进。
    二、贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以提高全面的教育质量，在毛泽东思想的红旗光辉照耀下，全校师生对参加劳动和改造思想，已成为自觉的要求，从而劳动纳入教育计划，建立了教育新秩序，与此同时，整顿了实习工场，加强了领导，成为教学与生产劳动，科技研究三结合的基地，根据学生年级劳动要求，制定了劳动课的大纲，在学生的劳动中，加强政治思想上和技术上的领导，使学生在思想品德上，理论知识上，技术操作上，得到全面的提高，在劳动中，能与工人同吃同住同劳动，能和工人建立深厚的感情，学到了工人阶级的优秀品质，加速了锻炼的效果，过去培养一个熟练的工人，要六个月的时间，现在的学生只经过两个月的时间，达到同样的水平，在质量上也有显著的提高，在丝织车间的成品正品率，从过去的60％，提高到92％并有创造100％，也有达到完全无扣分的新纪录。在缫丝车间的产品质量，由过去的AA级，提高到4A级，今年的一年级生，进车间二十五天，竟以3A的原料蚕，缫出了8A级的生丝，这完全由于学生提高了政治思想，对生产负责，掀起认真学习，刻苦耐劳，深刻钻研的新风气所致。
    三、大搞科技研究，以提高科技和教学的水平，并推动生产技术的进步，1959年在党委领导下，以科技研究，面向教学，结合生产的方针，组织了教师学生工人和技术人员，进行群众性的科技研究，作为经常的教学活动，而以突破重点，带动全面的方法，开展了校内外的大协作，发扬了坚持不懈，奋战到底的精神，取得的成绩是巨大的。
    （1）在缫丝方面为实现机械化自动化，经反复试验，制成了“丝专59型自动索理绪机”它的生产劳动率比日本多摩式机提高到50％，缫折也比较小，现在已得到领导上鉴定，在江苏定型推广，先制造六十组，作为老厂改造应用。
    （2）最近又经冲天干劲，将试验两年来的自动缫丝机上定纤度感知器，获得了快速感应的成果，得到多方的好评，已能超越日本的自动缫丝机应用的定粒添绪器，目前正在制造四百绪，投入生产试验，将作为文教系统群英大会上的献礼。
    这样的科技研究，使理论和实际结合、基础技术与专业结合、教师学生和工人、技术人员结合，是为今后进一步开展“高精尖”科技革命，和提高教学质量，打下了良好的基础。
    四、大搞教材革新：过去的教师很少参加实际生产，所以脱离实际之处很多，并且限于资产阶级的世界观，其内容不免陈腐落后，缺乏思想性、科学性、系统性，自从在党的领导下，组织了教师、学生、工人和技术人员，共同编写教材后，把教育革命，深入到教材中去，目前已编出了高等中等的专业教材各四种，同时教师在参加编写教材中，大大提高了业务水平，并加速了青年教师的培养，这确是教育革命的重大成就。
    以上种种情况，是由于党的领导，群众的政治挂帅，自觉的发挥积极力量，在一浪推一浪中，得到飞速的前进，对蚕桑产质量，于最短期间，大量增长，已无问题，但蚕茧仅是丝绸的原料，其加工设备，尤须从速准备，以迎接大量增产，并须从速推广机械自动化，和向“高精尖”技术研究，使产品质量和劳动生产率同时提高。又在丝绸原料生产的性质上，对人民公社的丝绸制造工业，应如何设计，如技术人材的培养，原料与工厂规模的配合，设备的规划，机械采用的标准，经营管理的制度等，亦宜从速研究，以适应继续大跃进的需要。
    以上所言，是否有当，自觉非常粗浅，请各位委员指正。
