Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: The Fuzhou Municipal State-Owned Taijiang Bamboo Building Materials Factory, though small, has ambitious goals. In just five days, it revolutionized its manual operations. Using indigenous methods and equipment, they created more than ten sets of machinery, totaling over eighty units, essentially achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization for manual tasks such as sawing bamboo, splitting bamboo, slicing bamboo, making bamboo ropes, and weaving bamboo mats. This sets a brilliant example for the bamboo ware industry to engage in a major technological revolution.

Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, praised the workers' soaring enthusiasm for technological revolution with the momentum of splitting bamboo when he visited the factory. He also instructed relevant departments to assist the factory in expanding its machine repair workshop into a bamboo machinery manufacturing plant, to produce complete sets of bamboo machinery and equipment for bamboo factories in various counties and people's communes, rapidly achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations in the bamboo ware industry throughout the province.

Thousands of workers, farmers, and cadres from all over the province have been visiting this small factory in recent days to learn from their communist style of daring to think and daring to act, exemplified by "revolutionizing in five days."

The bamboo ware industry is closely related to people's production and daily life. Although there is a saying "irresistible as splitting bamboo," turning bamboo into bamboo mats and other bamboo products requires patient, meticulous, and laborious work. In the past, workers splitting bamboo had to hold one end of the bamboo against a bamboo-splitting knife and the other end against their stomach, pushing hard. Workers splitting bamboo strips not only had to use a knife to split, but also had to bite with their mouths, often twisting their mouths and slanting their teeth. Workers weaving mats had to bend over and squat on the ground to weave. Therefore, technological innovation is the urgent desire of bamboo ware workers.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, all factory employees quickly launched a revolutionary storm of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. Within five days, they put forward more than 700 rationalization proposals and used local materials such as bamboo, wood, and iron to create complete sets of equipment, fundamentally changing the backwardness of manual operations throughout the factory.

Now, large moso bamboo poles as thick as bowls are quickly cut at both ends by the rapidly rotating bamboo-sawing machine. They are then sent into the horizontally placed bamboo-splitting machine, automatically passing through knife holes and being split into eight to sixteen equal bamboo strips. The bamboo strips are transformed into thin and narrow bamboo strips through strip-splitting machines, bamboo-slicing machines, and others, and finally sent to the mat-weaving workshop. Many mat-weaving machines in this workshop, like indigenous looms, weave countless thin bamboo strips into bamboo mats and bamboo sheets of various specifications.

The workers' labor is both light and efficient. The work efficiency of each process has increased by two to forty times compared to manual operation. The entire factory only needs forty-six workers to operate, which is equivalent to the manual operation of 522 workers in the past. At the same time, the raw material utilization rate is also more than 30% higher than during manual operation. The workers wrote poems praising: "In the past, splitting thin strips relied on biting with teeth, mouths were twisted and teeth were slanted, making people half dead from exhaustion; today, with mechanization, we report the good news to the Party, increasing production and saving labor, we laugh heartily."

With the spirit of continuous revolution, all factory employees are continuing to move towards the goals of full mechanization and semi-mechanization automation. At the same time, the entire factory is using the saved labor to vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, preparing to establish satellite factories for advanced fiber, advanced bamboo ware, oil felt, and a bamboo machinery manufacturing plant.

    竹器业革新技术的好榜样
    福州台江竹材建筑厂高速度实现机械化半机械化
    新华社福州电　福州市地方国营台江竹材建筑厂厂小志大，五天时间就革掉手工操作之命。他们用土办法、土器材，创制出了十多套共八十多台机械，基本上实现了锯竹、破竹、劈篾、打竹索、编竹篷等手工操作机械化半机械化，为竹器行业大闹技术革命树立了光辉的榜样。中共福建省委第一书记叶飞在参观这个工厂时，对工人们这种以破竹之势大闹技术革命的冲天干劲，给了很高的评价，并且责成有关部门协助这个工厂把机修车间扩建成为竹材机械制造厂，为各县和各人民公社竹器厂制造成套的竹材机械设备，迅速地在全省竹器行业中实现手工操作机械化半机械化。来自全省各地的成千工人、农民和干部等，连日来纷纷到这个小厂参观，学习他们“五天革个命”的敢想敢干的共产主义风格。
    竹器行业同人们的生产和日常生活密切相关。历来虽有“势如破竹”的成语，但要把竹子变成竹篷等竹器，却要经过耐心细致和费力的劳动。过去，破竹工人要把竹子对等辟开，就得把竹子一端顶在破竹刀上、一端顶在肚皮上用力推；破篾工人不但要用刀裂，还要用嘴巴咬，往往把嘴巴也扭歪了，牙齿也咬斜了；编篷的工人要弯着身躯，蹲在地上编织。因此，革新技术是竹器工人的迫切愿望。全厂职工在党支部领导下，迅速掀起了一个手工操作机械化半机械化的革命风暴。他们在五天之内就提出七百多条合理化建议，用竹、木、铁等土器材大造成套设备，使全厂手工操作的落后面貌根本改观。
    现在，一根根碗口粗的大毛竹，通过飞快转动着的锯竹机，很快截头去尾，被送进横篾着的破竹机，自动穿过刀孔，被破成八片到十六片均等的竹片；竹片经过破片机、破篾机等，就变成一条条又细又薄的竹篾，最后被送到编篷车间。这个车间的许多台编篷机，就像土法织布机一样，把无数条的细竹篾编织成了一张张不同规格的竹篷和竹席。工人劳动既轻快，每道工序的工效又分别比手工操作提高两倍到四十倍，全厂只要四十六个工人操作，就抵上了过去五百二十二个工人的手工操作，同时原料利用率也比手工操作时提高30％以上。工人们写诗赞道：“过去破薄篾，依靠牙齿咬，嘴歪牙齿斜，令人累半死；今天机械化，向党来报喜，增产又省力，哈哈笑不己。”
    全厂职工正以不断革命的精神，继续向着全程机械化和半机械化自动化的目标前进。同时，全厂利用节约下来的劳力，正在大搞原料综合利用，筹办高级纤维、高级竹器、油毛毡等卫星工厂和竹材机械制造厂。
