Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. With the completion of agricultural cooperation nationwide, workers in chemical, machinery manufacturing, construction, and food industries in the German Democratic Republic, responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the German Socialist Unity Party, are launching a movement to support agriculture.

The program of support for agricultural production put forward by the largest chemical factory in the German Democratic Republic, the Leuna Chemical Factory, has become a model for various factories. The program stipulates that 7,000 more tons of nitrogen fertilizer should be produced this year, and various fertilizers for agricultural use should be researched and tested. Many machinery manufacturing plants have also put forward their own tasks. The Grossenhain factory decided to produce one more standard engine for agriculture every day. The Johannisthal State-owned Engine Factory decided to produce an additional 5 million marks worth of products for agriculture without affecting the original production plan, including 335 engines and 1 million marks worth of parts.

Construction workers and building materials factories have also joined this movement, proposing to supply more building materials to help farmers build livestock sheds. The "Socialist Labor Team" composed of workers, technicians, and veterinarians in the Karl-Marx-Stadt Meat Combine is trying to extract protein-containing feed from slaughterhouse waste. Some factories that are not directly related to agricultural production are also actively participating in this movement to support agriculture. Workers at the Dresden Aircraft Factory proposed to manufacture batteries for raising chickens for farmers without consuming more raw materials or increasing costs.

Workers not only vigorously support agriculture in production, but they also carry out political propaganda for farmers. During the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, a large number of workers went to the countryside to participate in propaganda work. In the current consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, many workers have gone to the countryside to introduce to farmers the experience of organizing socialist collective labor in industry, and some have also helped farmers carry out competitions to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Many workers also used their voluntary labor to help farmers build livestock sheds. During the spring sowing season, many workers from machinery manufacturing plants also went to the countryside to help farmers repair machines in a timely manner.

In the movement to support agriculture, some factories have also launched competitions. The Leipzig Agricultural Machinery Factory, state-owned, challenged all agricultural machinery factories, calling on all factories to complete their production plans as soon as possible to help develop agriculture.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to reports in the local newspapers, Professor Lonnitz, Minister of National Education of the German Democratic Republic, said that in the fully cooperativized rural areas, the new task of socialist school education is: the difference in cultural level between urban and rural areas must be eliminated earlier than originally planned.

Lonnitz said that special attention should be paid to the system of production guidance days, which is not only the center of comprehensive technical education and socialist schools, but also helps to arouse children's interest in agriculture, so that they will continue to stay in rural areas.

Lonnitz pointed out that socialist mutual assistance must be organized. He called on cities and regions in the southern district to help schools in the northern district in terms of laboratory equipment and other aspects of teaching. The best graduates of normal colleges and experienced veteran teachers from urban schools should be mobilized to support rural schools.

The minister also spoke about the role of teachers in helping to launch a cultural revolution and strengthen rural schools in rural areas.

    伦尼茨指出合作化后教育的新任务是更早地消灭城乡间文化水平差别
    新华社柏林16日电　随着农业合作化在全国范围内的完成，德意志民主共和国化学、机械制造、建筑和食品等工业企业的工人响应德国统一社会党八中全会的号召，正在展开一个支援农业的运动。
    德意志民主共和国最大的化学工厂——洛伊纳化学工厂所提出的支援农业生产的纲领成为各工厂的范例。这个领纲领规定，今年要多生产七千吨氮肥，要研究和试验农业用的各种肥料。许多机器制造厂也提出了自己的任务。格罗森哈因工厂决定每天为农业多生产一个标准型的发动机。国营约翰尼斯塔尔发动机工厂决定在不影响原定生产计划的情况下，再为农业多生产价值五百万马克的产品，其中包括三百三十五部发动机，以及一百万马克的零件。
    建筑工人和建筑材料工厂也投入这一运动，他们提出要更多地供应建筑材料，以帮助农民建造畜舍。卡尔·马克思斯塔特肉类联合企业中的由工人、技术人员、兽医等组成的“社会主义劳动队”正在想办法从屠宰场的废弃物资中提取含蛋白质的饲料。一些与农业生产没有直接关系的工厂也积极参加这一支援农业的运动。德累斯顿飞机制造厂的工人提出在不多消耗原材料和不增加费用的条件下，为农民制造饲养小鸡用的电池。
    工人们不仅在生产中大力支援农业，他们还向农民进行政治宣传。在农业合作化运动的高潮中，大批工人下乡参加宣传工作。在当前巩固农业生产合作社中，又有许多工人下乡向农民介绍在工业中组织社会主义集体劳动的经验，有的还帮助农民开展争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。也有许多工人用自己的义务劳动帮助农民建造畜舍。春播期间，许多机器制造厂的工人还下乡帮助农民及时修理机器。
    在支援农业的运动中，一些工厂之间还展开了竞赛。国营来比锡农业机械厂就向所有农业机械厂提出挑战，号召各厂尽早完成生产计划，帮助发展农业。
    新华社柏林16日电　据此间报纸报道，德意志民主共和国国民教育部长伦尼茨教授说，在全部合作化的农村中，社会主义学校教育的新任务是：必须比原先计划的时间更早地消灭城乡之间在文化水平方面的差别。
    伦尼茨说，应该特别重视生产辅导日的制度，它不仅是综合技术教育和社会主义学校的中心，而且会有助于引起儿童对农业的兴趣，这样他们会继续留在农村。
    伦尼茨指出，必须组织社会主义的互助。他号召南部专区的城市和地区在实验室设备和教学的其他方面帮助北部专区。应该动员师范学院最优秀的毕业生和城市学校中有经验的老教师去支援农村的学校。
    这位部长还谈到教师在农村中在帮助展开文化革命、加强农村学校等方面所起的作用。
