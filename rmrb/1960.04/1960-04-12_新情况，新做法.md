　　New Situations, New Practices

　　Wheat has entered the jointing stage. According to past practices, the jointing water should be applied late, otherwise it is prone to excessive growth and lodging. However, Shaanxi Province has broken the old rules this year and put forward the slogan of applying jointing water and fertilizer early.

　　This slogan is correct. Because this year's wheat was sown during the autumn drought last year and has been growing in the spring drought, the soil moisture is insufficient due to the prolonged drought. According to the current wheat growth situation, it is necessary to add water and fertilizer early. Therefore, Shaanxi Province's practice of applying jointing water and fertilizer early is an example of adapting to local conditions and flexibly applying the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

　　The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture has taken root among the masses after two years of practice and struggle. People's understanding and application of the Eight-Character Charter has changed from unsystematic to systematic, from incomplete to comprehensive, and from unconscious to conscious, which is a fundamental change. As the vast masses master and apply the "Eight-Character Charter" with increasing proficiency, its power will inevitably become greater and greater, which is a powerful guarantee for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    新情况，新做法
    小麦进入拔节期，按照往年规矩是要迟浇拔节水，否则容易陡长、倒伏。但是陕西省今年打破老规矩，提出早浇拔节水、早施拔节肥的口号。
    这个口号是正确的。因为今年的小麦是在去年秋旱中播种，又在春旱中生长，由于长期干旱，底墒不足，根据当前小麦生长情况，需要提早加水加肥。因此，陕西省早浇拔节水、早施拔节肥的做法，是因地因时制宜、灵活运用农业“八字宪法”的一个范例。
    农业“八字宪法”经过两年来的实践和斗争，已经在群众中落脚生根了。人们对于八字宪法的认识和运用，从不系统到系统，从不全面到全面，从不自觉到自觉，这是一个根本性质的变化。随着广大群众掌握运用“八字宪法”熟练程度的提高，它的威力必然越来越大，这对于提前实现全国农业发展纲要是一个有力的保证。
