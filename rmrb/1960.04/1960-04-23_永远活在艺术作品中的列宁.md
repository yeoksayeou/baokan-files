    Lenin Lives Forever in Works of Art

    Portraying the image of the great revolutionary teacher Comrade Lenin is a significant theme in fine art creation. However, accurately shaping Lenin's image is not an easy task. The artists engaged in creation must not only possess high skills, but more importantly, have a deep understanding and boundless love for the revolution and the leader. Soviet and other countries' artists have devoted their greatest efforts to creating the brilliant image of the leader. Among countless artistic creations, many successful works have emerged. The statue "Lenin on the Tribune" created by Soviet sculptor B. Pinchuk is one example. Because the artist vividly shaped the image of Lenin in everyone's mind, it has been universally praised.

    Standing in front of such a statue, we are as moved as if we were really standing in front of Comrade Lenin. The sculptor not only accurately grasped Comrade Lenin's external characteristics, but also fully expressed the brilliance of Comrade Lenin's wisdom.

    Comrade Lenin is standing on the podium, his upper body slightly forward, gazing into the distance with that deeply concerned look, his powerful gaze directly towards the bright and splendid direction of communism. Seeing such a gaze, everyone will think: we must listen to Comrade Lenin's words, and resolutely devote all our energy to completing the great revolutionary cause. The statue also takes us back to the arduous years of the revolution more than forty years ago. Comrade Lenin's selfless revolutionary activities emerge before our eyes. We seem to see Comrade Lenin standing next to the machines in the factory, standing on the armored vehicles of the soldiers, using sincere and impassioned language to point out a completely new and unprecedented world to the broad proletariat. We also seem to see, from the eyes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the flames of hope and the passion for struggle ignited by Lenin's call.

    The statue successfully expresses Comrade Lenin's great revolutionary thought with foresight, and on the other hand, it makes people feel Comrade Lenin's amiability. Lenin's image lives forever in the hearts of the people. Lenin's image also lives forever in countless works of art.

    永远活在艺术作品中的列宁
    表现伟大的革命导师列宁同志的形象，是美术创作中一个重大的主题。但是要确切地塑造出列宁的形象，却不是一件很容易的事。从事创作的美术家不仅要有高度的技巧，更重要的是对革命和领袖要有深刻的认识，和无比的热爱。苏联以及各国的艺术家们，为了创造光辉的领袖形象，付出了最大的精力。在无数件艺术创作中，出现了不少成功的作品，苏联雕刻家B·平楚克创作的雕像“列宁在讲台上”就是一例。因为艺术家生动地塑造出了每个人心目中的列宁形象，所以曾受到了普遍的赞扬。
    站在这样一座雕像面前，我们就像真的站在列宁同志面前一样感动。雕刻家不仅准确地掌握了列宁同志的外部特征，同时也非常充分地表达了列宁同志智慧的光辉。
    列宁同志站在讲台上，上身微微向前，正用那深切关注的目光注视着远方，那有力的眼神，直射往光辉灿烂的共产主义方向。看到这样的目光，每个人都会想到：一定要听列宁同志的话，为了完成宏伟的革命事业，坚决付出全部精力。塑像也把我们带到四十多年以前，革命的艰苦年代里。列宁同志忘我地革命活动浮现在我们眼前。我们好像看到列宁同志站在工厂里的机器旁边，站在士兵们的铁甲车上，用诚恳而激动的语言，向广大无产者指出了全新的、前所未有的世界。我们也好像从工人、农民、士兵的眼睛里，看见了由于列宁的号召，而燃起了希望的火焰和斗争的热情。
    雕像一方面成功地表达出列宁同志富有预见性的伟大革命思想，另一方面又使人感到列宁同志的和蔼可亲。列宁的形象永远活在人民的心上。列宁的形象也永远活在无数的艺术作品中。　　（彭鸿远）
