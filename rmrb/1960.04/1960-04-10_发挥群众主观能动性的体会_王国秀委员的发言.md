Chairman, fellow committee members:

I warmly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC. The reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian unfold a magnificent picture of prosperity and the continued leap forward of 600 million people. Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country has completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. These are all new victories achieved under the leadership of the Party and under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. I feel extremely excited. The Party and Chairman Mao have again formulated a grand and practical national economic plan for 1960, calling on the people of the whole country to take industry as the leading factor and agriculture as the foundation, to combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and to vigorously develop people's communes, striving for the continued leap forward of the national economy. Our country's national economic plan fully proves that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are engaged in peaceful socialist construction at a high speed and are committed to the cause of peace and benefiting the people. In the 1960 budget, more than 80% is used for economic and cultural construction, while defense only accounts for 8.3% of the budget. In contrast, the US government's military expenditure for 1960-1961 accounts for 57.1% of the budget. The ironclad facts expose the ugly face of US imperialism's false peace and real arms race, and powerfully refute the slanderous remarks of US imperialism against our country. Our peace forces are growing stronger day by day, and the US imperialism's disguise cannot deceive the peace-loving people of the world.

In this epoch-making era, especially since the anti-rightist and boost-morale movement, the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country has been further improved. On all fronts of industry, agriculture, science and technology, culture, education, health, and medicine, the masses of the people have further broken down superstitions, broken old frameworks, and set off a new upsurge of national technological innovation and cultural revolution. Countless male and female pioneers, red flag collectives, and red flag bearers have emerged in various places. Every day and every month, various semi-mechanized and mechanized new creations have appeared, from steelmaking and agricultural tools to cooking and changing diapers for babies. It is indeed "the unity of the people, the galloping of horses, the brilliance of colors, and the renewal of everything". The three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have played an invincible role. The infinitely beautiful situation strengthens our confidence and determination in building socialism at high speed. I deeply realize that as long as we implement the Party's General Line and a whole set of related policies, and hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we can greatly give play to the subjective initiative of the masses. Now I would like to talk about my understanding of the Party's General Line and related policies in giving play to the subjective initiative of the masses from the perspective of my work practice and the facts of the leap forward that I have witnessed during my visits and inspections.

I. On the high-speed development of education

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, in order to respond to the Party's great call for large-scale development, universalization, and improvement, Shanghai's universities and colleges, since the anti-rightist and boost-morale movement, have further set off a new upsurge of educational revolution. Under the leadership of the Party, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology, mass movements have been carried out on a large scale. For example, the number of students at Tongji University has grown from 800 to 8,000 in recent years. Now, a correspondence department has been added to walk on two legs, opening up a new way for industrial universities to cultivate talents. Young students and teachers in various schools are full of energy, breaking down superstitions and breaking through old rules and regulations to vigorously engage in compiling teaching materials and scientific research in the spirit of continuous revolution. For example, in order to compile a historical dictionary, the Department of History of East China Normal University mobilized all teachers and students of the department. Under the direct guidance of the general branch, everyone participated in compiling 6,000 entries, totaling about 2.6 million words. This dictionary will be printed soon. If this arduous task was not to give play to the power of the masses, teachers, and students to cooperate, but only to rely on a few people to compile, it would not be known when it would be completed. At present, major universities in Shanghai are vigorously launching a curriculum reform movement. Students and teachers are enthusiastically striving to thoroughly reform the basic courses of each department in a very short period of time, deleting outdated teaching materials and adding the latest scientific data. On the one hand, it is necessary to compress the content and time of lectures, but without affecting the quality of teaching. It is necessary to creatively come up with a brand-new teaching method, and it is planned to complete the basic courses in one to two years. For example, the Department of Mathematics of a certain university will use one to two years to teach the basic courses of mathematics, and the general history of China will be taught in two years. In order to squeeze out time to open and improve cutting-edge courses, so that students can read more reference books, do more experiments and internships, and do more scientific research, cultivate their independent thinking and independent working ability, and climb the peak of science. This has brought about a revolutionary change in curriculum reform and realized the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in education. At the same time, the principle of combining education with productive labor is implemented, and arrangements are made for students to go to the countryside to participate in labor and social surveys, or to go to factories to operate with workers, so as to closely link theory with practice. Teachers and students all feel that the educational revolution has greatly improved the quality of teaching and the level of scientific research. The students' grades have been significantly improved.

Under the leadership of the Party, secondary, primary and spare-time education have also been greatly developed. At present, primary school education in Shanghai has been basically popularized. There are 5,493 primary schools in the city, with more than 1.62 million students, including 2,796 public schools and 2,697 private schools. In addition, there are 1,997 spare-time primary schools. By implementing the mass line and walking on two legs, the people's education has been greatly developed.

II. On the supply of books and materials

The upsurge of cultural revolution is closely related to the supply of books and materials. In order to meet the needs of the development of industrial, agricultural and cultural construction, the supply of books and materials has made certain progress in the past. However, the book work is often in a passive position, unable to keep up with the requirements of the new situation. The anti-rightist and boost-morale movement has given great inspiration and education to publishing and book information workers. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, Shanghai published a total of 3,036 new books in their first editions and 3,283 reprints in 1959, with a total of 280 million copies printed. Among them, about 85% were sold throughout the country, which played a great role in the Great Leap Forward on all fronts of national industry, agriculture, culture, and education.

Due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the mental outlook of the workers in various bookstores and libraries has undergone great changes; the passive thinking and style of waiting for readers to come to the door in the past has been initially reversed, and the slogan of "close contact, active cooperation, and timely supply" has been put forward, striving to achieve "four diligences" - brain diligence, mouth diligence, hand diligence, and foot diligence. For example, in coordination with the development of animal husbandry in rural communes, the Shanghai Library compiled a "Ten Rearing" directory for reference, and often actively provided the latest and best books and periodicals on technological innovation to various factories, delivering books to the door, so that various factories could use these materials and practices to create new products. The Shanghai Library used only one year and three months to compile the "General Record of Chinese Series Books" through the cooperation of libraries in various places, with a total of 2,700 entries and about 2.2 million words. Japan had done a similar general record in the past, spending more than ten years to compile only 1,000 entries, and there were still many errors. Under the leadership of the Party, the library of Shanghai universities also actively cooperated with teaching and scientific research, took the initiative to closely contact teachers and students, went deep into various departments to understand the situation, and timely supplied the required books and periodicals. The workers of the East China Normal University Library took learning Mao Zedong Thought as the driving force of their work, and put forward the clarion call of "food and grass go first before the army sets out," serving teaching and scientific research, and striving to play a leading role. The Normal University Library set up professional reading rooms in various departments, implemented the policy of "centralized management, decentralized use, and overall allocation" and the method of a one-stop service throughout the library, combining the upper and lower levels, linking the left and right, and communicating information, striving to find books for people and people for books. For example, when students in the Department of Geography wanted to compile a "Dictionary of the Sea of Words," they needed a large number of reference books. The library immediately mobilized all the urgently needed books in the library and various reading rooms to concentrate on meeting the needs of readers and complete the work of compiling the "Dictionary of the Sea of Words" in a timely manner. For another example, the chemical department librarian and the teachers and students of the department became one with each other and were familiar with their situation. When helping students to intern in middle school education, the librarian found out the situation before the internship, mobilized the required books, did a good job in the leading work, and timely solved the students' internship requirements. For books with few copies and out of print, the librarian immediately solved the problem of few books and many people through interlibrary loan and mobilizing students to temporarily hand over their books for collective reading.

Xie Cuifeng, a young salesperson in Shanghai Xinhua First Bookstore, led her group members to try every possible means to understand the needs of every reader who came to the store to buy books. She could know what kind of industry each customer belonged to and what he needed by observing his words and expressions. She took the initiative to recommend the required books and solve the difficulty of readers finding books. She was called a "living catalog" and was selected as a "March 8th" Red Banner Bearer. From the work of books, I have learned that under the leadership of the Party and the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the subjective initiative of the masses has been greatly brought into play, the communist style of large-scale cooperation has been realized, and the work of books can play a great positive role in serving teaching and scientific research. Of course, the transition from passive to active in the work of books and materials is only the beginning, and we still need to strive to leap forward.

With the rapid development of economic construction, the superstructure must adapt to the needs of the economic base. Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian pointed out that a high tide of cultural revolution should be set off in 1960. Education should be greatly developed, popularized, and improved, and leap forward. As an educator, I feel very excited and encouraged. Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's care and constant education for intellectuals, the socialist consciousness of intellectuals has indeed been improved since the Great Leap Forward, and they have a further understanding of the Party's leadership and the mass line, and have also made certain achievements. However, intellectuals, including myself, are not leaping forward enough in serving socialism and socialist transformation, and they still cannot keep up with the requirements of the new situation. Intellectuals are not sensitive enough when new things begin to sprout, and they lack confidence. They often have to wait until the results of new things appear before they are convinced. In the fields of education and scientific research, how to implement "more, faster, better, and more economical" has not been completely resolved. Some intellectuals, especially older intellectuals, still have some complacency in their thinking, dare not break the old framework, and are afraid of disrupting order. Therefore, in their work, they are often in a passive position to adapt to the ever-changing new requirements. A few older intellectuals still have more or less some twilight thoughts and inferiority complexes, thinking that they are old, lack energy, and cannot compete with the young pioneers who are full of vigor. We can only be those who give way. These views are great obstacles to our service and transformation. The fundamental problem is that the world outlook of our intellectuals has not been thoroughly changed, and political command is not enough. Under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we do not have enough understanding of the implementation of the Party's General Line and a whole set of policies, the combination of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, and we have not been able to wholeheartedly devote ourselves to this great torrent of technological revolution and cultural revolution in our specific actions. High-speed socialist construction inevitably requires us to have a high-speed self-transformation. Otherwise, we will become promoters of retreat and stumbling blocks to socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must, under the leadership of the Party, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, spur our horses on, and make a great leap forward in transformation and service. Old age is an inevitable physiological law, but old people should be energetic when they are old. We must always maintain a pleasant, revolutionary and optimistic spirit, and be proud and celebrate that we can live in the era of Mao Zedong. In the process of high-speed socialist construction, we must "give way without stopping." Young people and adults are brave pioneers, and we must also be old and strong like Old General Huang Zhong, catching up. I want to seize the time to study Chairman Mao's works, take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide for all actions, and as quickly and thoroughly as possible change my world outlook and become a worker-class intellectual in the true sense of the word. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we must closely unite with the 600 million people to successfully complete the great historical tasks assigned to us by the Party. I hope that all committee members will supervise and guide us.

    发挥群众主观能动性的体会
    王国秀委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我热烈拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案以及陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告展开了一幅欣欣向荣、六亿人民继续跃进的宏伟壮丽的巨画。在党和毛主席正确的领导下，我国已提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。这些都是在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，获得新的胜利果实。我感到无比的兴奋。党和毛主席又规定1960年宏伟而切实可行的国民经济计划，号召全国人民以工业为主导、以农业为基础、使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合，并且大发展人民公社，为争取国民经济的继续跃进而努力奋斗。我国的国民经济计划充分证明，全国人民在党和毛主席英明的领导下，正在热火朝天地高速度进行和平社会主义建设，致力于和平及造福人民的事业。1960年预算中，80％以上是用于经济文化建设，而国防仅占预算8.3％。相反的，美国政府1960—1961年度的军费就占预算57.1％。铁一般的事实揭穿了美帝国主义的假和平，真备战的狰狞面目，有力地驳斥了美帝国主义对我国污蔑的谰言。我们的和平力量日益加强了，美帝国主义的伪装手法欺骗不了世界爱好和平的人民的。
    在这划时代的岁月里，尤其是自反右倾、鼓干劲运动以来，全国人民的社会主义觉悟又进一步提高，在工业、农业、科学技术、文教卫生医药各条战线上，人民群众进一步破除迷信，打破旧框框，掀起一个全民性的技术革新，和文化革命的新高潮。各地涌出无数的男女闯将、红旗集体和红旗手。每天、每月从炼钢、农具到烧菜及婴儿换尿布都出现了各种各样的半机械化和机械化的新创造成绩。确实是“万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”。总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝，已起了无往而不胜的作用。无限美好的形势加强我们对高速度建设社会主义的信心和决心。我深深体会到只要贯彻了党的总路线和有关一整套方针，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜就能大大发挥人民群众的主观能动性。我完全相信在党和毛主席英明领导下，全国人民一定能完成并超额完成1960年的宏伟计划。现在我想从工作实践中，及参观视察目睹的跃进事实谈谈我对党的总路线和有关一套方针，发挥群众的主观能动性的几点体会。
    一、关于教育事业高速度发展方面
    在1958年大跃进的基础上，为了响应党的大发展，大普及和大提高的伟大号召，上海各高等学校，自反右倾、鼓干劲以来，进一步掀起一个教育革命的新高潮。在党的领导下，以毛泽东思想为主导，大搞群众运动。例如同济大学的学生数年来从八百发展到八千，现时添设函授部以两条腿走路，为工业大学开辟培养人才的新途径。各校青年学生和教师干劲冲天，破除迷信突破陈规旧律以不断革命的精神大搞编写教材及科学研究。例如华东师大历史系，为了编写一部历史辞典就动员了全系师生，在总支的直接指导下，人人动手共编了六千条，条目共约二百六十万字。这部辞典在最近就可付印了。这项繁重的工作如果不是发挥群众的力量，师生合作，而仅仅依靠少数人编写，就不知何年何月才能完成。目前上海各大专学校正在轰轰烈烈展开课程革新运动。学生、教师沸腾地争取在很短时间内把各系的各门基础课程彻底革新，删除陈腐的教材，增添最新的科学资料。一方面要压缩讲课内容和时间，但又不影响教学质量。要创造性地搞出一套崭新的教学方法，讲授基础课要计划在一至二年内完成，例如某高等学校的数学系要以一至二年的时间教完数学基础课，中国通史要在二年内教完。以便挤出时间开设及提高尖端课程，使学生多看参考书，多搞实验和实习，多搞科学研究，培养他们的独立思考、独立工作能力，攀登科学的高峰。这就使课程革新起了革命性的变化，实现教育事业多快好省的原则。同时贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的原则，安排一定时间使学生下乡参加劳动和社会调查，或下厂与工人共同操作，把理论和实际密切联系起来。师生都感到教育革命大大提高了教学质量和科学研究水平。学生的成绩有显著的改进。
    在党的领导下，中等、初等和业余教育，同样有了很大的发展。目前上海市小学教育已基本普及。全市共有小学五千四百九十三所，学生一百六十二万余人，其中公办二千七百九十六所，民办的二千六百九十七所。另外还有业余小学一千九百九十七所。贯彻了群众路线和两条腿走路，人民教育事业就大大发展起来了。
    二、关于图书资料供应方面
    文化革命高潮和图书资料供应是有着密切关系的。配合工、农业和文化建设发展的需要，过去图书资料供应方面有了一定的发展。但是图书工作常处于被动地位，赶不上新形势的要求。反右倾、鼓干劲运动，给出版事业和图书资料工作者很大的启发和教育。在党的总路线光辉照耀下，上海在1959年共出版了初版新书三千零三十六种，重版三千二百八十三种，共印二亿八千万册。其中85％左右是销行全国各地，对国家工农业文化教育各条战线的大跃进起了很大作用。
    由于党的加强领导和毛泽东思想的指导，各书店及图书馆的工作者的精神面貌上起了很大的变化；初步扭转过去等读者上门的被动思想和作风，提出“密切联系，主动配合，及时供应”的口号，争取做到“四勤”——脑勤、嘴勤、手勤、脚勤。例如上海图书馆配合农村公社的畜牧发展编了“十养”目录供应参考，经常把有关技术革新最新最好的图书期刊，主动地供给各工厂，把书送上门，使各工厂利用这些资料和实践创造新产品。上海图书馆用了仅仅一年零三个月的时间，通过各地图书馆的合作编制了“中国丛书综录”一部，共有二千七百个条目，约二百二十万字。日本过去曾搞过类似的综录，用了十几年的时间只编了一千条，还存在着很多的错误。上海高等学校图书馆在党的领导下，也积极配合教学和科学研究，主动地密切和师生联系，深入各系了解情况，及时供应所需的书刊。华东师大图书馆的工作者，学习以毛泽东思想为工作的动力，提出“大军未发粮草先行”的号角，为教学、科学研究服务，要争取发挥先行的作用。师大图书馆在各系设立专业阅览室，实行“集中管理、分散使用、全面调配”的方针和全馆一条龙，上下结合，左右联系，互通声息的方法，力求做到为人找书，为书找人。例如地理系同学要编写“辞海”，需要大量的参考书，图书馆立刻调动库藏及各阅览室所有急需的图书集中起来满足读者的要求，及时完成编写“辞海”的工作。又例如化学系图书管理员和系师生打成一片熟悉他们情况。帮助同学到中学教育实习时，管理员在实习前摸清情况，调动了需要的图书，做好先行的工作，及时解决同学实习的要求。复本少和绝版的图书，管理员即通过馆际互借，和动员同学把自己的书暂时交给集体阅览来解决书少人多的问题。
    上海新华第一书店青年营业员谢翠凤带动她的组员千方百计了解每个到店买书的读者的需要。她察言观色就能知道每位顾客是属于那一种行业，及他的需要。她主动地推荐所需的图书，解决读者找书的困难。她被称为“活目录”，并被选为“三八”红旗手。从图书工作我体会到，在党的领导和毛泽东思想的旗帜下，群众的主观能动性，大大发挥，大协作的共产主义风格，实现图书工作为教学和科学研究服务就能起很大的积极作用。当然图书资料工作从被动转为主动仅仅是开端，还需要努力跃进。
    随着经济建设飞速的发展，上层建筑必须适应经济基础的需要，李富春和李先念两位副总理都指出1960年要掀起一个文化革命高潮。教育事业要大发展、大普及、大提高，向前跃进。作为一个教育工作者，我感到十分兴奋和鼓舞。由于党和毛主席对知识分子的关怀和不断的教育，大跃进以来，知识分子的社会主义觉悟确有所提高，对党的领导和走群众路线有了进一步的认识，也做出了一定的成绩。但是知识分子，包括我个人在内，为社会主义服务和社会主义改造还跃进得不够，仍赶不上新形势的要求。知识分子对新事物开始发芽时敏感性不强，信心不足，往往要等到新事物的成果出现，才会信服。在教育事业、科学研究方面，怎样贯彻“多快好省”还没有得到彻底的解决。部分知识分子，尤其是老年的知识分子，在思想上还存着些满于现状，不敢打破旧框框，怕打乱秩序。因此在工作中适应日新月异的新要求，就常常处在被动地位。少数老年知识分子还或多或少有些黄昏思想和自卑感，认为年老了，精力不足，无法和生龙活虎的青年闯将们比赛，我们只能做让路者。这些看法对我们的服务和改造都是很大的障碍。根本问题是我们知识分子的世界观还未有彻底的改变，政治挂帅不够。在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，对贯彻党的总路线的一整套方针，对不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合，认识得不够，在具体行动上更未能全心全意投入这个伟大的技术革命、文化革命的洪流中。高速度社会主义建设就必然要求我们高速度的自我改造。否则我们就会成为促退派，成为社会主义革命、社会主义建设的绊脚石。我们一定要在党的领导下，以毛泽东思想来武装自己，快马加鞭，在改造和服务方面来一个大跃进。年老是不可避免的生理法则，但老年人应老而有朝气。我们要经常保持愉快、革命乐观的精神，以能活在毛泽东时代而自豪而欢庆。在高速度社会主义建设过程中，我们要做到“让路而不停车”。青壮年们做雄纠纠的闯将，我们也要做老当益壮的老黄忠、迎头赶上。我要抓紧时间学习毛主席的著作，以毛泽东思想为一切行动的指针，尽速地、彻底地改变了世界观，成为名副其实的工人阶级知识分子。在党和毛主席的领导下，和六亿人民紧密团结在一起共同出色地完成党交给我们的伟大历史任务，希望各位委员督促、指教。
