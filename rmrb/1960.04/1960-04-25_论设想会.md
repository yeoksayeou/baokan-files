    On Suggestion Meetings
    Mass suggestion activities are a good way to further break down superstition, liberate thinking, allow the general line to penetrate the hearts of the people, and promote the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do among the broad masses of workers. It is also a good way to gather wisdom and concentrate the infinite wisdom of the masses. Suggestion meetings are by no means fantasy meetings, let alone aimless random thinking. Suggestion meetings have a certain mass base, ideological base, and material base. The suggestion meetings at the Dalian Shipyard envision both the distant future and the near future, combining the distant and the near, with the near as the main focus. Envisioning the distant future enables the masses to see far ahead, fostering great ambitions and lofty aspirations. Since the suggestions also focus on the near future, primarily addressing key issues in current production, through methods such as job dissection and process clearance, the wisdom of the masses is concentrated on transforming manual labor into mechanized production and resolving key production problems. This integrates the masses' bold creative spirit with production reality. However, an individual's wisdom is limited. Often, the suggestions for reforming technology and equipment are not perfect or not very perfect. But through collective brainstorming, mutual inspiration, and mutual supplementation, the problems suggested by an individual become more substantial and continuously improved.
    Since suggestion meetings are created by the masses, regardless of whether they are big or small, confident or uncertain, suggestions can be boldly put forward, making them most popular among the broad masses. Suggestion meetings can most widely mobilize and attract the broad masses to participate in the movement, thus making it possible to quickly form a situation where everyone makes suggestions and the whole people make suggestions.

    论设想会
    群众性的设想活动是进一步破除迷信、解放思想，使总路线深入人心，发扬广大职工群众敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格的良好形式，也是集思广益，集中群众无穷智慧的良好形式。设想会绝不是幻想会，更不是无目标的乱想。设想会是有一定的群众基础、思想基础和物质基础的。大连造船厂设想会既设想远的，又设想近的，远近结合，以近为主。由于设想远的，这就使群众看的远，大树雄心、立大志。由于设想又以近为主，首先是针对当前生产中的关键问题，通过工种解剖和工序过关的方法，使群众智慧集中在变手工劳动为机械化生产、解决生产关键问题上，这样就使群众的大胆创造精神和生产实际结合起来。但是一个人智慧毕竟有限，往往对自己要改革的技术、设备等问题，设想的还不够完善或不大完善，可是通过集体设想，互相启发，互相补充，这就使一个人设想的问题更加充实和不断完善。
    设想会由于是群众创造的，不管大设想、小设想，有把握的或没有把握的设想，都可以大胆地提出来，所以最受广大群众欢迎。设想会最能广泛地动员和吸引广大群众参加到运动中来，因此，就有可能很快形成人人设想，全民设想的局面。
