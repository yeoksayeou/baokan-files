    Japanese Workers' Spring Struggle
    Lan Hai

    The Japanese workers' spring struggle, which began on March 19th, is developing vigorously. This struggle is centered on the 3.6 million members of the 57 industrial unions affiliated with "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and almost all of the 800,000 members of the 20 industrial unions affiliated with the Liaison Council of Neutral Trade Unions have also joined.

    In every spring struggle, the central demand of Japanese workers is to increase wages. Especially because this year the monopoly capitalists have exploited the working class more than in the past under the so-called "unprecedented prosperity," it is entirely reasonable for the workers to demand more wage increases this year. Last year, the demand was to increase monthly wages by about 2,000 yen, but this year the average demand is to increase them by about 3,000 yen, with the highest, such as the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union ("Zendentsu"), demanding an increase of 7,000 yen.

    While demanding large-scale wage increases, the participating workers are also listing the establishment of a minimum wage system and the reduction of working hours as major struggle goals.

    This year's spring struggle began on March 19th, the day of the 13th nationwide unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." On this day, approximately 4 million workers participating in the spring struggle across the country participated in this unified action, holding numerous mass rallies and workplace meetings. In the climax of preventing the Diet from approving the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the scale and momentum of the spring struggle were also quite magnificent. On March 23rd, the National Railway Motive Power Union, a neutral trade union, decided to hold two-hour workplace meetings during working hours as the first practical action against the management's intensification of labor. From the end of March to the beginning of April, union organizations such as the Federation of Synthetic Chemical Fiber Workers' Unions (with 110,000 members), the Japan Coal Miners' Union (with 200,000 members), the All Japan Harbor Workers' Union (with 18,000 members) affiliated with "Sohyo," and the All Japan Electrical Machine Workers' Union (with 160,000 members) affiliated with the neutral system unions, held the first batch of strikes. Responding to the call of "Sohyo," on April 5th, the 14th nationwide unified action week against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," unions of government officials and public corporations held one-hour workplace meetings, while general enterprise unions held simultaneous fixed-time strikes. According to the instructions of "Sohyo," during the 15th national unified action week starting from April 15th, union members of government officials and public corporations will hold two-hour workplace meetings, while union members of general enterprises will hold strikes for more than 24 hours.

    The Japanese working class is the biggest victim of the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security Guarantee System." Japanese monopoly capital colludes with U.S. monopoly capital and attempts to realize its ambition of foreign expansion with the support of the latter. Japanese monopoly capital is formulating specific plans for overseas expansion. The Kishida Nobusuke government, a loyal representative of Japanese monopoly capital interests, under strong pressure from the United States, has adopted a "trade and exchange liberalization" policy aimed at "opening the door" to the United States. The result of implementing "trade and exchange liberalization" is that increased competition, both internationally and domestically, is entirely foreseeable. Therefore, in order to cope with competition in domestic and foreign markets, Japanese monopoly capital is doing everything possible to increase its capital and implement equipment innovation and other measures to so-called "improve corporate structure." Currently, they are promoting capitalist "enterprise rationalization" according to this policy. So-called "enterprise rationalization" for workers means layoffs, increased labor intensity, and wage cuts, etc.

    In order to suppress workers' demands for wage increases and labor-management disputes caused by demands for wage increases, Japanese monopoly capital advocates "stable wages that adapt to Japan's long-term stable economic development plan," launching an attack on the working class's right to life. The so-called "stable wages" is to implement low wages for a long time and increase the exploitation of the working class. This year's spring struggle is a fierce struggle between the Japanese working class and the monopoly capital's low-wage policy.

    Today, Japanese monopoly capital's so-called "enterprise rationalization" is being carried out in the entire industrial sector. And it is being implemented most blatantly in the coal mining industry, one of the basic raw material industries. The number of Japanese coal miners decreased from 450,000 to 280,000 in the twelve years from 1947 to 1959. During this period, due to capitalists adopting equipment renewal and intensifying workers' labor intensity, etc., coal production increased from 30 million tons to 50 million tons. Coal mine capitalists plan to reduce another 110,000 workers by 1963 and greatly increase coal production.

    Currently, the spearhead of this so-called "enterprise rationalization" offensive by coal mining monopoly capital is focused on Japan's largest coal mine - the Mitsui Zaibatsu's Miike Coal Mine (located in Omuta City, Kyushu, with 15,000 workers). The capitalists of the Miike Coal Mine dismissed 1,214 union members by name last December. Most of them are activists in the workers' movement. Obviously, the capitalists intend to strike at the backbone of the union to disintegrate its combat effectiveness and pave the way for promoting "enterprise rationalization." The Miike Coal Mine Union, with the assistance of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, has repeatedly carried out non-continuous strikes of 24 to 72 hours to demand the cancellation of the decision to dismiss by name. On January 25th this year, the capitalists used the means of a complete shutdown of the Miike Coal Mine to deal with the strike. At the same time, they launched a frantic divisive activity against the union, organizing a pro-management union in an attempt to disintegrate the workers' strike struggle. Recently, the capitalists have been extremely vicious, hiring thugs to murder worker Kubo Kiyoshi, creating a bloody tragedy.

    The Japan Coal Miners' Union is one of the strongest of the industrial unions affiliated with "Sohyo," and the Miike Coal Mine Union is one of the strongest of the union organizations that have joined the Japan Coal Miners' Union. This union launched a 113-day long strike in 1953 to oppose layoffs and achieved a brilliant victory. The reason why Japanese monopoly capital wants to start with the Miike Coal Mine is to disarm the Miike Coal Mine Union and remove one of the strongest strongholds in the Japanese trade union movement. If their conspiracy succeeds, they can open a gap for disintegrating the entire trade union movement.

    The Japanese working class is determined to fight to ensure the victory of the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle. Members of the Japan Coal Miners' Union contribute 600 yen per month, and members of non-coal mine unions affiliated with "Sohyo" contribute 50 yen per month to support the Miike Coal Mine workers and the workers of the "Nittetsu Company" Nitase Coal Mine who are also fighting to refuse layoffs. The union organizations affiliated with the Japan Coal Miners' Union have decided to hold several powerful strikes in April to insist on demanding a monthly wage increase of 2,000 yen and to support the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle. On April 11th, 160,000 workers from 14 major coal mining companies will launch a strike. At the same time, in order to stop the supply of coal to the Mitsui Zaibatsu system companies in Omuta City, five unions in the transportation sector, including the National Railway Union, the National Railway Motive Power Union, the Private Railway Union, the All Japan Transport Workers' Union, and the All Japan Harbor Workers' Union, have established a joint struggle committee with the Japan Coal Miners' Union to strengthen cooperation in the struggle. In this way, with the development of the spring struggle, the Miike Coal Mine workers, with the strong support of their brothers and sisters in the national working class, will inevitably continue to increase their combat effectiveness and launch a powerful counterattack against monopoly capital.

    Since the war, the Japanese working class's spring struggle has been an annual event. However, this year's spring struggle has important significance.

    This year's spring struggle is not only an economic struggle, but also a major political struggle with the task of preventing the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. At the same time, as the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle shows, this year's spring struggle is also a serious struggle to protect trade union rights from being undermined by monopoly capitalists. Currently, Trotskyites, who have influence on some student and worker movements, are trying to incite workers participating in the spring struggle to completely abandon economic struggles and engage in "political struggle" with extremely "leftist" actions. On the other hand, right-wing social democrats are trying to limit the spring struggle to economic struggles, and in essence, they want to ignore the political struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Both of these tendencies are very harmful.

    In contrast, the Japanese Communist Party fundamentally opposes the above two deviations. The Japanese Communist Party unites the national struggle to prevent the ratification and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the workers' economic demands and the various demands of the broad masses of the people, and strives unremittingly to promote the development of the national democratic united front. This correct policy of the Japanese Communist Party is being accepted by more and more workers. Under the guidance of this correct policy, not only the spring struggle, but also the entire struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, for national independence, peace, and democracy will continue to develop.

### 日本工人的春季斗争

    日本工人的春季斗争
    蓝海
    3月19日揭开了序幕的日本工人的春季斗争，正在蓬蓬勃勃地开展着。这次斗争以“总评”所属的五十七个产业部门工会的三百六十万会员为中心，中立工会联络协议会所属的二十个产业部门工会的八十万会员也几乎全部投入进来。
    每年春季斗争中，日本工人提出的中心要求，都是提高工资。尤其因为今年垄断资本家们在所谓“空前繁荣”情况下，榨取工人阶级的血汗也比过去多，所以工人们今年要求多加一些工资也是完全合理的。去年春季斗争中要求提高月工资二千日元左右，今年则平均都要求增加三千日元左右，最高的，如全国电信电报业从业员工会（“全电通”）要求增加七千日元。
    参加春季斗争的工人群众在要求大规模地增加工资的同时，并且把确立最低工资制和缩短工作时间，列为一项重大的斗争目标。
    今年的春季斗争是在3月19日第十三次反对新日美“安全条约”全国统一行动那一天开始的。在这一天，全国各地参加春季斗争的约四百万工人，投入了这一统一行动，举行了许多群众大会和工作场所集会。在阻止国会批准日美军事同盟条约的高潮中，春季斗争的规模气势也颇为雄壮。3月23日，中立系统工会的国营铁道动力车工会，决定在工作时间举行两小时的工作场所大会，作为反对资方加强劳动强度的第一个实力行动。从3月下旬到4月上旬，“总评”所属的合成化学纤维工会联合会（拥有会员十一万人）、日本煤矿工会（拥有会员二十万人）、全日本港湾工会（拥有会员一万八千人），以及中立系统工会所属的全日本电机工会联合会（拥有会员十六万人）等工会组织，举行了第一批罢工活动。响应“总评”的号召，在反对新日美“安全条约”第十四次全国统一行动周的4月5日，机关公务员和公共企业的工会均召开了一小时的工作场所大会，一般企业工会则一齐举行了定时的罢工。按照“总评”的指示，在从4月15日开始的第十五次全国统一行动周内，机关公务员和公共企业工会会员将举行两小时的工作场所大会，而一般企业的工会会员则将举行二十四小时以上的罢工。
    日本工人阶级是所谓日美“安全保障体系”的最大受害者。日本垄断资本同美国垄断资本勾结，并企图在后者的支持下实现其对外扩张的野心。日本垄断资本正在制订向海外扩张的具体计划。日本垄断资本利益的忠实代表——岸信介政府，在美国的强烈压力下，采取了以向美国“开放门户”为目标的“贸易和汇兑自由化”政策。实施“贸易和汇兑自由化”的结果，国际和国内范围的竞争加剧，是完全可以想见的。因此，日本垄断资本为了应付国内外市场上的竞争，竭尽一切力量来增加自己的资本和实行设备革新等等所谓“改善企业体质”的种种措施。目前，它们正根据这个方针来推行资本主义的“企业合理化”。所谓“企业合理化”对于工人来说，就意味着解雇、加强劳动强度和降低工资等等。
    日本垄断资本为了压制工人提高工资的要求，以及因要求提高工资而引起的劳资纠纷，提倡“适应日本经济长期稳定发展计划的稳定工资”，向工人阶级的生活权利发动进攻。所谓“稳定工资”就是要长期实行低工资，加重对工人阶级的剥削。今年春季斗争，就是日本工人阶级同垄断资本的这种低工资政策的一场激烈的斗争。
    今天，日本垄断资本的所谓“企业合理化”，是在整个产业部门里进行的。而实行得最露骨的，则是基础原料产业部门之一的采煤业。日本的煤矿工人，在1947年到1959年的十二年内曾经从四十五万人减到二十八万人。在这段时间里，由于资本家采取设备更新和加强工人劳动强度等手段，煤的产量从三千万吨增加到五千万吨。煤矿资本家计划到1963年为止还要减少十一万工人，并且大大提高煤产量。
    目前，煤矿业垄断资本的这种所谓“企业合理化”攻势矛头，正集中指向日本最大的煤矿——三井财阀的三池煤矿（位于九州大牟田市，有工人一万五千人）。三池煤矿的资本家在去年12月曾经指名解雇了一千二百一十四个工会会员。他们大多数是工人运动积极分子。显然，资本家是打算打击工会的骨干以瓦解它的战斗力，为推行“企业合理化”铺平道路。三池煤矿工会在日本煤矿工会的援助下，为要求取消指名解雇的决定，一再地实行了二十四小时至七十二小时的不连续罢工。今年1月25日资本家以三池煤矿全部停工的手段来对付罢工。与此同时，对工会展开了猖狂的分裂活动，组织御用工会，妄图瓦解工人的罢工斗争。最近资本家穷凶极恶，雇打手杀害工人久保清，造成流血惨剧。
    日本煤矿工会是“总评”所属的产业部门工会中最强的一个，而三池煤矿工会又是加入日本煤矿工会的工会组织中最强的一个。这个工会在1953年曾经发动过一百一十三天的长期罢工来反对解雇，并且取得了辉煌的胜利。日本垄断资本之所以要拿三池煤矿开刀，就是想解除三池煤矿工会的武装，除掉日本工会运动中最强的一个据点。如果他们的阴谋得逞，他们就可以为瓦解整个工会运动打开一个缺口。
    日本工人阶级为了使三池煤矿工人斗争获得胜利而坚决地进行斗争。日本煤矿工会会员每月拿出六百日元，“总评”所属的非煤矿工会会员每月拿出五十日元，来支援三池煤矿工人以及同样为拒绝解雇而斗争的“日铁公司”二濑煤矿的工人们。日本煤矿工会所属的工会组织，为了坚持提高月工资二千日元的要求和支援三池煤矿工人斗争，决定在4月份举行几次有力的罢工活动。4月11日，十四家大煤矿公司的十六万工人将发动罢工。同时，为了停止向大牟田市的三井财阀系统各企业供应煤炭起见，国营铁道工会、国营铁道动力车工会、私营铁道工会、日本全国搬运工会、全日本港湾工会等运输部门的五家工会，同日本煤矿工会成立了一个共同斗争委员会，以加强斗争中的协作。这样，随着春季斗争的开展，三池煤矿工人在全国工人阶级兄弟的大力支援下，必然会不断地增强战斗力，向垄断资本进行强有力的回击。
    战后以来，日本工人阶级的春季斗争是一年一度的。但是，今年的春季斗争有着重要的意义。
    今年春季斗争不单是经济斗争，而是负有阻止批准日美军事同盟条约任务的重大政治斗争。同时，正如三池煤矿工人斗争所表明的，今年的春季斗争又是一场保卫工会权利不受垄断资本家破坏的严重斗争。目前，对一部分学生运动和工人运动有影响的托洛茨基分子，力图煽动参加春季斗争的工人完全放弃经济斗争，并且以极“左”的行动来从事“政治斗争”。另一方面，右翼社会民主主义者力图使春季斗争以进行经济斗争为限，实质上是要把反对日美军事同盟条约的政治斗争撇开不管。这两种倾向都是十分有害的。
    与此相反，日本共产党则根本反对上述两种偏向。日本共产党是把阻止批准和争取废除日美“安全条约”的民族斗争同工人的经济要求以及广大人民的各项要求统一起来，为了胜利地推进民族民主统一战线的发展而奋斗不懈。日本共产党的这一正确方针，正在为越来越多的工人群众所接受。在这种正确的方针指导下，不仅春季斗争，而且整个反对日美军事同盟、争取民族独立、和平、民主的斗争都将会得到不断的发展。
