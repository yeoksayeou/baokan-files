The Change of "Seizing"
Yang Ling

"Seizing the harvest," "seizing the planting," "seizing the soil moisture," "seizing the sunny weather." "Seizing for disaster relief," "seizing the season," "seizing the right moment"... In agricultural production, many activities use the word "seize." This shows that agricultural production is often an extremely tense battle. Who are we seizing from? From nature, including wind, rain, and water, including sunshine, temperature, and time. "Seizing" contains two aspects of meaning: on the one hand, to make full use of nature's favorable factors to seize more agricultural products from nature; on the other hand, to avoid nature's unfavorable factors, and not allow nature to destroy the fruits of labor.

"Seizing" shows that people strive to be in an active position in the face of nature, and shows that people are striving to exert subjective initiative. However, striving for initiative does not mean being completely active, and the exertion of people's subjective initiative is also constrained by people's subjective conditions and objective conditions. Since the beginning of agricultural production, people have been constantly "seizing" from nature. Only after experiencing countless failures did they figure out some relatively effective experiences of when it is most necessary to "seize" and what methods to use to "seize." People's experience has gradually increased in thousands of practices; however, when this practice was still being used by individual households with very inefficient tools, "seizing" had a large passive component, and could only be "seizing as much as you can get," "seizing is better than not seizing." The exertion of human agency is greatly limited by this old relationship between people, and also greatly limited by the backward production tools used by people and the degree of people's understanding of natural laws.

Now, we still need to "seize" in agricultural production. The scale of the battle is thousands of times larger than in the past, and the initiative of the battle is also incomparably greater. The relationship between people has undergone tremendous changes, and the nature of "seizing" in agricultural activities has also undergone tremendous changes. The members of the people's commune no longer passively cope with the seasons, but strive to use objective conditions to control the seasons according to human needs. Let's see how the people of Hunan Province are now "seizing": Here, the sowing of spring miscellaneous grains, the harvesting of spring crops, and the transplanting of early rice, the three major farm works have always been squeezed together. In the past, we could only "squeeze" and "seize" like this, "fight a chaotic battle," and "seizing" made people exhausted, and in the end, we inevitably lost one thing while taking care of another. People did not have the strength to prepare all kinds of preparatory work as early as possible, nor did they have the strength to change the growing time of crops, so they had to do so. What is the "seizing" method now? Actively "seizing," planned "seizing," truly achieved "early action is strength." The area of miscellaneous grain crops has doubled compared with last year, and the planting time has been advanced by one month to forty days compared with previous years. In this way, we have "seized" more than a month's time, and also "seized" an additional six million mu of miscellaneous grains. Then, process and cultivate spring harvest crops, and call for wheat, rapeseed, etc. to mature and harvest early. With this "seizing," the time for spring harvest, spring planting, and early rice transplanting are staggered. This not only frees up manpower, but also frees up land, and the spring harvest crop fields can be plowed in time after harvest and early rice can be transplanted in time. In addition, with more than 500,000 rice transplanters and more than one million skilled users of rice transplanters, plus the complete innovation of tools in other aspects, "seizing the harvest," "seizing the planting," and "seizing the transplanting" are not only done faster, but also more refined. Such "seizing," such "tension," is completely different from the past "seizing" and "tension" from the inside out.

This change is not over. The working people of our country will fight against nature in new and constantly developing ways. It can be imagined that in the face of seasons and various forces of nature, people will become more and more active and more and more in control. Finally, there will be a day when the word "seize" will completely lose its original meaning in agricultural production. "Seizing" will eventually develop into a complete conquest of nature.

    “抢”的变化
    杨岭
    “抢收”，“抢种”，“抢墒”，“抢晴”。“抢险”，“抢季节”，“抢火候”……在农业生产中，许多活动都用了一个“抢”字。这说明农业生产常常是极其紧张的战斗。跟谁抢夺？跟大自然，包括风、雨、水，包括阳光、气温、时间。“抢”包含两方面的意义：一方面，尽量运用大自然的有利因素，向大自然夺取更多的农产品；另方面，避开大自然的不利因素，不让大自然摧毁劳动的成果。
    “抢”，表明人们在大自然面前力争居于主动地位，表明了人们在力求发挥主观能动性。可是，力争主动并不等于已经完全主动，人的主观能动性的发挥也受着人的主观条件和客观条件的约束。自有农业生产以来，人们就不断地在同大自然“抢夺”。不知经历了多少次失败的教训，才摸出了什么时候最需要“抢”、用什么办法“抢”的比较有效的一些经验。人们的经验在千百万次实践中逐渐增长着；可是，当这实践还是单家独户地使用着效率很低的工具的时候，“抢”就带着很大的被动成分，只能是“抢到一点是一点”，“抢比不抢好”。人的能动作用的发挥，受着这种旧的人与人之间的关系的很大的限制，也受着人们所使用的这种落后的生产工具和人们对自然规律的认识程度很大的限制。
    现在，在农业生产中还是要“抢”。战斗的规模比过去要大千百倍，战斗的主动性也大得没法相比。人与人之间的关系发生了巨大的变化，农事活动中的“抢”的性质也发生了巨大的变化。人民公社的社员们不再是被动地应付季节，而是力求按照人的需要利用客观条件来支配季节。且看湖南省的人们现在是怎样在“抢”的：在这里，春杂粮的播种，春收作物的收获，早稻的插秧，三项主要的农活从来都是挤在一起的。过去，就只能这么“挤”着“抢”，“打乱仗”，“抢”得人们疲劳不堪，结果还是不免顾这头丢那头。人们既没有力量及早把各种准备工作做好，也没有力量改变作物的生长时间，只好如此。现在是怎样个“抢”法？主动地“抢”，有计划地“抢”，真正做到了“早下手为强”。杂粮作物面积比去年扩大了一倍，种完的时间比往年提早了一个月到四十天。这样，就“抢”到了一个多月的时间，而且多“抢”种了六百万亩杂粮。然后，加工培育春收作物，叫小麦、油菜等等都早熟早收。这样一“抢”，春收、春种和早稻插秧的时间都错开了。这样不但腾出了人手，而且腾出了土地，春收作物田收获后可以及时地翻耕、及时地插上早稻。再加上五十多万部插秧机和一百多万使用插秧机能手，加上其它方面的工具的成套革新，“抢收”“抢种”“抢插”不但做得更快，而且更加精细。这样的“抢”，这样的“紧张”，同过去的“抢”和“紧张”，从里到外完全变了样子。
    这个变化并没有到头。我国劳动人民将以不断发展的新的方式跟大自然作斗争。可以想像到的是：在季节和自然界的各种力量面前，人们将要越来越主动，越来越操纵自如。终于会有那末一天，“抢”字在农业生产中将会完全失去它原来的意思。“抢”发展到最后，就会成为对大自然的完全的征服。
