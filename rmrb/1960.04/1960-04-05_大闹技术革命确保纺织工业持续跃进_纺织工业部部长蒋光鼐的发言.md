Comrades and Representatives,

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee.

Adhering to the comprehensive leap forward policy of high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, safe production, and improved labor productivity, the textile industry has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the national textile workers resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, adhered to the leap forward development speed, and launched a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, enabling the textile industry to achieve another great victory of continued leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. The annual output of cotton yarn was 8.25 million pieces, an increase of 35% compared with 1958; cotton cloth was 7.5 billion meters, an increase of 32% compared with 1958; yarn for knitwear increased by 13.6%; wool fabrics increased by 19%; and silk fabrics increased by 32%. The production of cotton spinning machines reached 1.4 million spindles, an increase of 40% compared with 1958; cotton weaving machines produced more than 21,900 units, an increase of 60% compared with 1958. Among them, major products such as cotton yarn have already reached the 1962 targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

During the great leap forward in production, national textile enterprises adhered to the comprehensive leap forward policy of high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, safe production, and improved labor productivity, extensively and deeply carried out mass movements centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, launched socialist labor competitions to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward, greatly improved the technical level of the textile industry, and promoted the comprehensive leap forward in production. In the past year, the unit equipment production capacity of various textile enterprises has been further improved, with the unit output of cotton spindles being half or even more than twice as high as that of advanced capitalist countries. In terms of improving product quality, increasing varieties and saving raw materials, new achievements have also been made due to continuous innovation in technology and equipment and the active adoption of new technologies. The broad masses of workers have also researched and designed many new high-efficiency equipment. Building a new cotton spinning mill with 100,000 spindles can save more than 1 million yuan in investment, more than 1,000 tons of steel, and reduce the construction area by 3,600 square meters after adopting these equipments. All these fully demonstrate that the technical level of China's textile industry is improving rapidly. We are fully capable of climbing the peak of science and technology of the world textile industry in a not too long time.

There has also been a great leap forward in the basic construction of the textile industry. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, textile industrial departments throughout the country have resolutely implemented the policy of concentrating forces and ensuring key projects, implemented the policy of combining large-scale enterprises with medium-sized and small enterprises, vigorously grasped the complete set of machinery and equipment, and vigorously carried out mass movements in construction and installation, enabling a large number of newly built enterprises to be put into production quickly, well, and economically, ensuring the needs of the production leap forward. There were 35 factories above the quota put into production throughout the year, and the newly added cotton spinning production capacity reached 1 million spindles. The production capacity of wool, linen, silk, knitwear, printing and dyeing industries has also greatly increased. The textile machinery industry has also developed rapidly. In 1958, only six provinces and cities in the country had textile machinery industry, but by 1959, it had developed to nineteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. New technical forces are also growing rapidly in various places. These have laid a better foundation for the high-speed development of the textile industry throughout the country.

The high-speed development of the textile industry not only guarantees the supply of the domestic market, but also guarantees the needs of exports. In 1959, the quantity of textile products sold domestically and abroad in my country increased considerably compared with 1958.

The victory of the two consecutive great leaps forward in the textile industry in 1958 and 1959 is the victory of the Party's general line, the great victory of the people's communes and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, and the great victory of putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements. High-speed development of the textile industry is the Party and the country's consistent policy, and it is also the requirement of the high-speed and proportionate development of China's national economy. Under the leadership of the Party, the national textile industry sector is precisely in accordance with the Party's general line, adhering to the policy of high-speed development of the textile industry, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and fully mobilizing all positive factors, thus ensuring the high-speed, more, faster, better, and more economical leap forward of the textile industry. Now, after two years of great leap forward practice and the education of the anti-rightist struggle after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the national textile workers have a deeper understanding of the greatness and correctness of the Party's general line, which is the basic guarantee for realizing the continuous leap forward of the textile industry.

Considering both current needs and long-term development, making comprehensive arrangements to ensure the continuous leap forward in 1960

In 1960, China's textile industry will continue to develop at a high speed and in an all-round way. The annual plan is to produce 9 million pieces of cotton yarn, an increase of 750,000 pieces compared with 1959. Cotton cloth, printed and dyed cloth, knitwear, wool, linen, and silk fabrics will also have new growth. The production of textile machinery and the scale of basic construction of the textile industry will grow even more. The annual plan is to produce 2.5 million spindles of complete sets of cotton spinning equipment, an increase of 84% compared with 1959. Complete sets of equipment for wool, linen, and silk textile industries will also be produced and supplied in large quantities this year. There are as many as 105 new and expanded cotton, wool, linen, and silk textile factories and textile machinery factories and textile equipment factories above the quota, distributed in various regions of the country. In particular, those regions where the textile industry has developed less in the past few years and have the conditions have made more arrangements. These all show that the plan for developing the textile industry in 1960 is a comprehensive plan for continuous leap forward, a plan for a great leap forward that takes into account both current needs and long-term development. After the implementation of this plan, the production level of China's textile industry will be further improved, the quantity, variety, and quality of various textile products will be more abundant and colorful, and the layout of the textile industry will also be more reasonable.

At present, the leap forward situation in the textile industry is very good. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the main content, is developing forward with the force of overwhelming mountains and seas. Under the leadership of the Party, more than two million textile workers across the country, whether in the production sector or the basic construction sector, are enthusiastically engaged in this movement. They regard this movement as another liberation after the political and economic emancipation, and as an extremely significant step in developing China's textile industry at high speed and rapidly climbing the peak of world science and technology, demonstrating a high degree of consciousness, initiative, and creativity in the movement. They propose that technical innovation and technical revolution should also be "automated," to use their own brains, use their own hands, find their own materials, and liberate themselves. Therefore, they have fully developed the spirit of combining hard work, solid work, and skillful work, and will never give up until they achieve their goals. The momentum of the movement, the breadth of the scale, the depth of the mobilization, the number of creations, and the speed of effectiveness are all unprecedented in past technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The movement has not been carried out for a long time, but it has already achieved brilliant results. For example, in Shanghai's textile industry, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization at the beginning of this year was 62%, but by the end of March it had increased to 88%, and more than 90% of the transportation workers in various textile factories have been freed from heavy labor. In the past, some people believed that many manual operations in modern textile factories were difficult to replace with machines, but the broad masses of workers in various places have broken superstitions, vigorously promoted automatic doffing, automatic cleaning, automatic splicing, automatic tube changing, etc., and have achieved great results. The automatic or semi-automatic doffing machines that are currently being promoted in some cotton textile enterprises alone can save a lot of labor. The Harbin Flax Textile Factory is a modern textile factory equipped with the latest equipment. Some people once believed that there was no need or possibility to carry out large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution there. However, the broad masses of workers in the factory were not satisfied with the existing level of production technology. Under the three-way combination of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers, they successively created six automatic production lines, which can save 260 workers. Some small factories with extremely simple equipment have even greater ambitions and greater enthusiasm in the movement. For example, Shanghai No. 1 Silk Screen Printing Factory is a small factory with no machines, no motors, and no repair tools. In addition to a printing technician, the factory could not find a turner, fitter, electrician, or maintenance worker. However, the workers of the factory, under the heroic slogan of "If there are no tools, make them ourselves; if there are no materials, find them ourselves; if there are no coppersmiths, learn them ourselves; we will never be outstretched arms," used waste materials and old materials to make various tools, so that every process has innovation; only in the developing process, due to the implementation of mechanization and semi-mechanization, the number of people was reduced from the original twenty to eight. All these fully demonstrate that the Party's proposal to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the main content is fully in line with the wishes of the broad masses of the people, and it is also an objective requirement for the high-speed, proportionate, and sustained leap forward of socialist construction.

Combining production, vigorously launching a technical revolution, expanding raw material sources, and increasing varieties and designs

The current task of the national textile industry is to, under the leadership of the Party, with the spirit of continuous revolution, redouble our efforts, continue to boldly mobilize the masses, and push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the main content to a new climax. At present, medium-sized and small enterprises with backward equipment and a low degree of mechanization still account for a considerable proportion in the textile industry. Even in modern enterprises, although the degree of mechanization is relatively high, the degree of automation is not high, and there are still a large number of workers watching over the machines for manual operations; especially in auxiliary workshops and auxiliary work in production workshops, basically relying on manual operations. Therefore, all enterprises should proceed from their own actual conditions, closely combine with production needs, and according to the policy of walking on two legs and self-reliance, make overall plans and strive to change various heavy physical labor and manual operations to mechanization and semi-mechanization in the shortest possible time; all those that have already achieved semi-mechanization and partial mechanization should plan to gradually realize full mechanization; those with a high degree of mechanization should plan to develop towards automation, semi-automation, and continuous operation. While vigorously improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in production departments, it is also necessary to vigorously improve the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in living welfare departments, reduce non-production personnel, and save labor. While carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, labor organization and enterprise management work must also be continuously improved according to the new situation to meet the needs of the development of productive forces. In this way, we will be able to continuously push the movement to a new climax, greatly improve labor productivity, and save a large amount of labor to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the textile industry.

Opening up new raw material resources in every possible way, expanding the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and vigorously carrying out the saving and substitution of raw materials are another important content of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the textile industry. In the past two years, the production of textile raw materials such as cotton in my country has already greatly increased. However, in order to develop the textile industry at a high speed to better meet the needs of the people, while continuing to increase the production of cotton, wool, flax, and silk textile raw materials and accelerate the development of the chemical fiber industry, it is also necessary to fully utilize all natural spinnable fibers to increase production. China is a vast country with abundant resources. There are still many agricultural by-products (such as cotton stalk skins, etc.) and various wild fibers that can be utilized. Fully utilizing these spinnable fibers can turn useless into useful, turn small use into large use, and create more wealth for the country. This requires textile enterprises in various places to reasonably arrange uses according to the different conditions of raw materials, and fully mobilize the masses to innovate technology, innovate processes, and continuously expand the scope of utilization, improve quality, and reduce costs. Textile departments in various places should also organize technical forces to assist people's communes in solving technical problems in raw material processing. Recently, the Chengde Hemp Bag Factory in Hebei Province created a new type of degumming method, which greatly saved caustic soda and labor and improved the utilization rate of raw materials. This is a major technical innovation, which has opened up a new way for the large-scale utilization of cotton stalk skins. We have held a on-site meeting in Chengde and have vigorously promoted this experience throughout the country. While actively opening up new raw material resources, it is also necessary to pay close attention to the saving, substitution, and comprehensive utilization of raw materials to increase production. For example, using paper tubes instead of wooden yarn tubes, using plastics instead of leather to manufacture leather rollers and leather cots, using chrome-plated cast iron tubes instead of copper to manufacture the sizing rollers of sizing machines, and using tiles instead of copper skin to manufacture the cocoon troughs of silk reeling machines, etc. In these aspects, various places have already created many good experiences, which should be studied, summarized, and vigorously promoted.

Constantly improving product quality, producing various novel, inexpensive, durable, and wearable textile products, and manufacturing various new high-efficiency textile machines are another important aspect of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the textile industry. This requires us to constantly study the preferences and needs of the broad masses of the people, and promote the spirit of combining learning and originality, study and apply various new technologies and new technologies, vigorously improve product quality, and increase varieties and designs. In particular, this year's textile machinery industry has a large task of designing and manufacturing new products, a large part of which are wool, linen, and silk textile equipment and high-efficiency new equipment. Grasping the design, appraisal, finalization, and trial production of these equipments is an important link to ensure the completion of this year's new factory construction tasks and the high-speed and comprehensive development of the textile industry. The competent textile industrial authorities in various places must seize this work, fully utilize the "three-way combination" method of production enterprises, scientific research departments, and universities, and under the unified leadership of the Party, vigorously carry out mass movements to make the design and manufacturing of new equipment more, faster, better, and more economically.

Fellow representatives, comrades: At the beginning of the first year of the great 1960s, China's socialist cause is full of brilliant and continuous leap forward scenes everywhere. Mao Zedong's great banner is guiding us from one victory to another. Inspired by the great achievements of the two great leaps forward and the current excellent situation, more than two million textile workers across the country have made great ambitions and are determined to achieve a better and more comprehensive continuous leap forward in the first year of the 1960s. We believe that as long as we diligently study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, as the guide for all our work, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, adhere to putting politics in command, and adhere to vigorously carrying out mass movements, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill this year's plan, and victoriously complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state.

    大闹技术革命确保纺织工业持续跃进
    纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐的发言各位代表、各位同志：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，以及常务委员会的工作报告。
    坚持高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全生产和提高劳动生产率的全面跃进的方针，纺织工业获得空前大丰收
    全国纺织职工，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持了大跃进的发展速度，开展了群众性的增产节约运动，使纺织工业在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了1959年继续大跃进的伟大胜利。全年生产棉纱八百二十五万件，比1958年增加35％；棉布七十五亿米，比1958年增加32％；针织用纱增加13.6％；毛织品增加19％；丝织品增加32％。棉纺机生产一百四十万锭，比1958年增加40％；棉织机生产二万一千九百余台，比1958年增加60％。其中棉纱等主要产品已经提前达到了第二个五年计划规定的1962年的指标。
    在生产大跃进中，全国纺织企业坚持了高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全生产和提高劳动生产率的全面跃进的方针，广泛深入地开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，开展了比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义劳动竞赛，大大提高了纺织工业的技术水平，推动了生产的全面跃进。一年来，各类纺织企业的单位设备生产能力，都有了进一步提高，其中棉纺锭的单位产量要比先进的资本主义国家高出一半甚至一倍以上。在提高产品质量、增加花色品种和节约原材料方面，由于不断地革新工艺、革新设备和积极采用新技术，也取得了新的成就。广大职工还研究和设计了许多新型的高效能设备。新建一个十万锭的棉纺厂，经采用这些设备后，可以节约投资一百多万元，节省钢材一千多吨，减少建筑面积三千六百平方米。所有这些，都充分说明了我国纺织工业的技术水平提高很快。我们完全能够在不太长的时间内，攀登上世界纺织工业科学技术的高峰。
    纺织工业的基本建设，也有很大的跃进。全国各地纺织工业部门，在各级党委的领导下，坚决贯彻了集中力量、保证重点的方针，贯彻了大型企业和中小型企业相结合的方针，大抓机器设备的成台配套，大搞施工安装中的群众运动，使大批新建企业又多又快又好又省地投入了生产，保证了生产跃进的需要。全年投入生产的限额以上工厂就有三十五个，新增的棉纺生产能力达一百万锭。毛、麻、丝、针织、印染等行业的生产能力，也有很大增长。纺织机械工业发展也很快。1958年全国只有六个省市有纺织机械工业，而到1959年，则发展到十九个省、市、自治区有纺织机械工业。新的技术力量也正在各地大量生长起来。这些都为全国各地高速度发展纺织工业打下了更好的基础。
    纺织工业的高速度发展，不仅保证了国内市场的供应，同时也保证了出口的需要。1959年我国内销和外销纺织品的数量，都比1958年有相当的增长。
    1958年和1959年纺织工业两年连续大跃进的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，是人民公社和一套“两条腿走路”方针的伟大胜利，是政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的伟大胜利。高速度发展纺织工业，是党和国家的一贯方针，也是我国国民经济高速度按比例发展的要求。我国国民经济的全面跃进，特别是农业和重工业的飞跃发展，为纺织工业的持续跃进创造了有利的条件。全国纺织工业部门，在党的领导下，正是按照党的总路线，坚持高速度发展纺织工业的方针，大搞群众运动，充分调动一切积极因素，因而保证了纺织工业高速度地、多快好省地向前跃进。现在，经过两年大跃进的实践，以及党的八届八中全会以后反右倾斗争的教育，全国纺织职工对党的总路线的伟大和正确，认识得更加深刻了，这是实现纺织工业持续跃进的基本保证。
    既考虑当前需要，又考虑长远发展，全面安排，保证一九六零年持续跃进
    1960年，我国纺织工业将继续高速度地和全面地向前发展。全年计划生产棉纱九百万件，比1959年增加七十五万件。棉布，印染布，针织品，毛、麻、丝织品等也都有新的增长。纺织机械生产和纺织工业基本建设规模增长更大。全年计划生产棉纺成套设备二百五十万锭，比1959年增加了84％。毛、麻、丝纺织工业的成套设备，也将在今年大量生产供应。新建扩建的限额以上的棉、毛、麻、丝纺织厂和纺织机械厂、纺织器材厂就达一百零五个，分布在全国各地区。特别是那些几年来纺织工业发展得比较少，而又有条件的地区，作了较多的安排。这些都表明，1960年发展纺织工业的计划，是一个全面的继续大跃进的计划，是一个既考虑当前需要，又考虑了长远发展的大跃进的计划。这一计划实现以后，我国纺织工业的生产水平将进一步提高，各种纺织品的数量、品种、质量将更加丰富多彩，纺织工业的布局也将更加合理。
    目前，纺织工业的跃进形势很好。以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以排山倒海之势向前发展。全国两百多万纺织职工，无论是生产部门、基本建设部门，都在党的领导下，热情奔放地投入了这一运动。他们把这个运动看成是政治经济翻身后的又一次解放，看成是高速度发展我国纺织工业、迅速攀登世界科学技术高峰的一个具有极其伟大意义的步骤，在运动中表现了高度的自觉性、积极性和创造性。他们提出搞技术革新和技术革命也要“自动化”，要自己动脑，自己动手，自己找材料，自己解放自己。因而充分发扬了苦干、实干、巧干相结合的精神，不达目的，誓不罢休。运动声势之大，规模之广，发动之深，创造之多，收效之快，都是过去技术革新和技术革命运动所没有过的。现在运动开展还不久，即已取得了辉煌的战果。如上海纺织工业，今年年初的机械化半机械化程度为62％，到3月下旬已提高到88％，各纺织厂的运输工人有90％以上已经摆脱了笨重劳动。过去有人曾经认为，近代纺织厂有许多手工操作是很难用机器来代替的，但是在各地广大职工大破迷信，大搞自动落纱，自动清洁，自动接头，自动摆管等等，都已取得了很大的成绩。仅目前正在一些棉纺织企业推广的自动或半自动落纱机，就可节约大量劳动力。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂是用最新设备装备起来的现代纺织厂，曾有人认为在那里不需要也不可能再大搞技术革新和技术革命，但是该厂广大职工不满足于现有生产技术水平，在领导干部、工程技术人员和工人的三结合下，先后创造了六条生产自动线，可以节约二百六十个工人。一些设备极为简陋的小厂，在运动中雄心更大，干劲更足。如上海第一丝网印花厂是一个既没有机器、又没有马达、也没有修配工具的小厂。全厂除了有一个印花技术员外，找不出一个车工、钳工、电工或保全工。但该厂职工在“没有工具自己造，没有材料自己找，没有铜匠自己学，坚决不做伸手派”的豪迈口号下，利用废料、旧料制造各种工具，做到道道工序有革新；仅显色一个工序，由于实行了机械化、半机械化，即从原来的二十人减少到八人。这些都充分说明了，党提出的大搞以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，是完全符合广大人民的愿望的，也是社会主义建设高速度地按比例地持续跃进的客观要求。
    结合生产，大闹技术革命，扩大原料来源，增加品种花色
    当前全国纺织工业的任务，就是要在党的领导下，以不断革命的精神，大鼓干劲，继续放手发动群众，把以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，推向新的高潮。目前，纺织工业中设备落后，机械化程度较低的中小型企业还占相当比重，就是现代化企业，机械化程度虽然比较高，但是自动化程度还不高，看管机器的工人还有大量的手工操作；特别是辅助车间和生产车间的辅助工作，基本上还是依靠手工操作。因此，所有企业，都应该从各自的实际情况出发，紧密结合生产需要，根据两条腿走路和自力更生的方针，全面规划，争取在最短的时间内，把各种笨重的体力劳动和手工操作，改为机械化、半机械化；凡已经实现半机械化和已经局部机械化的，要有计划地逐步实现全部机械化；机械化程度较高的，要有计划地向自动化、半自动化和连续化的方向发展。在大力提高生产部门机械化、半机械化程度的同时，还要大力提高生活福利部门的机械化、半机械化程度，减少非生产人员，节约劳动力。在开展技术革新、技术革命运动的同时，劳动组织和企业管理工作也必须根据新的情况，不断地加以改进，以适应生产力发展的需要。这样，我们就能够把运动不断地推向新的高潮，大大提高劳动生产率和节约大批劳动力，以适应高速度发展纺织工业的需要。
    千方百计地开辟新的原料资源，扩大原料的综合利用，大搞原材料的节约和代用，是纺织工业技术革新和技术革命运动的另一个重要内容，最近两年来，我国的棉花等纺织原料的生产，已经有了很大增长。但是为了高速度地发展纺织工业，以更好地满足人民需要，在继续增产棉毛麻丝纺织原料和加速发展化学纤维工业的同时，还要充分利用一切天然可纺纤维来增加生产。我国是一个地大物博、资源丰富的国家，农作物的副产品（如棉秆皮等）和各种野生纤维，可以利用的还很多。把这些可纺纤维充分地利用起来，就可以变无用为有用，变小用为大用，为国家创造更多的财富。这就需要各地纺织企业根据原料的不同情况，合理安排用途，并充分发动群众，革新技术，革新工艺，不断地扩大利用范围，提高质量，降低成本。各地纺织部门还应该组织技术力量，协助人民公社解决原料加工中的技术问题。最近河北承德麻袋厂创造了新型的脱胶法，大大节约了烧碱和劳动力，提高了原料的利用率。这是一项重大的技术革新，为大量利用棉秆皮开辟了一条新的道路。我们已在承德召开了一次现场会议，并且已在全国大力推广这一经验。在积极开辟新的原料资源的同时，还要十分注意原材料的节约、代用和综合利用，以增加生产。如用纸管代替木制纱管，用塑料代替皮革制造皮辊和皮仁，用铸铁管镀铬代替铜制造浆纱机的压浆辊，用瓷砖代替铜皮制造缫丝机的茧槽等等。在这些方面，各地已经创造了许多很好的经验，应该研究、总结和大力推广这些经验。
    不断提高产品质量，生产各种花色新颖、价廉物美、坚牢耐穿的纺织品和制造各种新型的高效能纺织机器，这是纺织工业技术革新和技术革命运动的另一个重要方面。这就要求我们不断地研究广大人民的爱好和需要，并发扬学习和独创相结合的精神，研究和运用各种新工艺、新技术，大力提高产品质量，增加品种花色。特别是今年纺织机械工业的新产品设计、制造任务很大，其中很大一部分是毛、麻、丝纺织设备和高效能的新型设备。抓紧这些设备的设计、鉴定、定型、试制等工作，是保证完成今年新厂建设任务和高速度地全面地发展纺织工业的一个重要环节。各地纺织工业主管部门都要抓紧这项工作，充分运用生产企业、科学研究部门和高等学校的“三结合”的办法，在党的统一领导下，大搞群众运动，把新设备的设计和制造工作做得又多、又快、又好、又省。
    各位代表、各位同志：在伟大六十年代第一年的开始，我国社会主义事业，到处都充满着光辉灿烂的持续跃进景象。毛泽东的伟大旗帜，正在引导我们从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。全国两百多万纺织职工，在两年大跃进的伟大成就和当前大好形势的鼓舞下，已经立下了雄心大志，要在六十年代的头一年，实现更好更全面的继续跃进。我们相信，只要我们努力学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，把马克思列宁主义与中国革命实际相结合的毛泽东思想作为我们一切工作的指针，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，我们就一定能够完成和超额完成今年计划，胜利地完成党和国家交给我们的光荣任务。
