Big Collectives, Public Canteens: Disasters Bow Their Heads
Speech by Representative Zhang Sizhou

I fully endorse the three reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin on behalf of the State Council. These three reports are reports of continued leaps forward, reports that encourage enthusiasm. In general, they are exactly what our peasant brothers think and say.

On the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, our Cotton Harvest People's Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has already planned to sow 10,371 mu of major spring grain crops this year, ensuring a total output of more than 13.2 million jin, and striving to reach 15 million jin, an increase of 50% to 70% over 1959; and to sow 7,429 mu of cotton, ensuring a total output of more than 960,000 jin of ginned cotton on the premise of ensuring increased grain production, and striving to reach 1.1 million jin, an increase of 30% to 50% over 1959. At the same time, we will vigorously develop command fields, experimental fields, high-yield roads, high-yield plots, and cotton kings to climb the peak of high yields over large areas. This year, we plan to plant 100 mu of high-yield experimental fields with a yield of 1,000 jin to 2,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The output of other crops and Mao pigs and poultry will also be greatly increased. At the same time, we will also improve the commune-run industry and achieve an all-round leap forward.

I believe that this production plan of ours is entirely achievable, and it is possible to overfulfill the task. Because in seizing the bumper harvest of grain and cotton in 1959, all the facts have proved that the magic weapon of the People's Commune can stand the test. I am referring to last year's drought. Last year's drought was unprecedented in decades. From January to June, there was no significant rain. The cotton leaves were scorched and curled, and most of the rice fields were without water. Grandma Li, in the Cotton Harvest Cultivation Area, who is over ninety years old, only sighed all day long, saying, "It's exactly the same as the Year of Renyin, the crops will be ruined again this year." The scenes of famine in the old society made the old woman very scared, worried about how many people would starve to death again.

Fortunately, there is only one Grandma Li like this in our area. The vast majority of commune members not only feel at ease with the public canteen, but also have strong confidence. They fully believe in the endless power of the People's Commune. The entire commune, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, resolutely responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call to "fight drought and protect seedlings," using all drought-resistant tools, from water pumps to pots and pans, to draw water and irrigate under the scorching sun, and fight against the drought together. After more than 100 days of hard struggle, we finally basically achieved no dry patches, no missing nests, no dead seedlings, overcame the drought, and increased grain production by 49% compared with the special Great Leap Forward of 1958; cotton production increased by 20% compared with the special Great Leap Forward of 1958, realizing the production target of an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

In 1959, we not only suffered an unprecedented drought in decades, but also a flood. Because our area is a hilly region with poor soil, it is often either drought or flood, or both. Last year was just like that. As soon as the drought was overcome, torrential rains came in July, quickly and fiercely, and mountain floods broke out in just a day or two. Seeing this situation, the commune party committee immediately issued the call to "turn water damage into water conservancy." A large army for flood control and water storage immediately rushed into battle, guarding embankments, plugging leaks, diverting water, and storing water wherever possible. As a result, bad things turned into good things. The stored water played a significant role in the irrigation of crops last year and the water supply for the major and minor spring crops this year.

Needless to say, hard work alone is not enough. However, many facts have proved that after the People's Communes, the vast number of cadres and commune members not only have more enthusiasm than in 1958, but also have more spirit in transforming technology and studying science. This also played a significant role in seizing the bumper harvest of grain and cotton in 1959. In our commune, the Taiping, Gonghe, and Dashi cultivation areas have 500 mu of flood-prone land, which is often flooded after a heavy rain, and planting is equivalent to planting for nothing. In January 1959, according to the rainfall data predicted by the commune's weather station, with the assistance of relevant departments, we calculated that the rainfall in late July would reach about 200 to 300 millimeters. That is to say, even if the 500 mu of land were planted with spring crops, the harvest would not be guaranteed. However, this is what it was like in the old society. Now that we have recognized the laws of nature, we also have ways to use them. We quickly organized commune members to discuss how to ensure a good harvest on these 500 mu of flood-prone land. As a result of the discussion, everyone proposed planting early corn, putting the rainy season behind us in terms of time. We then mobilized the masses to rush to plant all the early corn in a few days. When the torrential rains came, sorry, our corn had already been harvested. After the torrential rains, we then planted more than 200 mu of winter corn and more than 200 mu of vegetables. As a result, these 500 mu of flood-prone land achieved a bumper harvest, with a yield of 1,500 jin of raw grain per mu. Many elderly people believe that this is a miracle, only possible in the era of the People's Commune.

In the continuous two-year leap forward in 1958 and 1959, our technical innovation and scientific research certainly included more than just what I have mentioned above. Here I would like to add that in cotton production, we follow the mass line and vigorously engage in technical innovation. According to the local natural conditions and the physiological characteristics of cotton, through continuous experimentation, we have found an experience to increase cotton production. This is: Follow the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, seize the opportunity from the beginning, maintain the spirit of seizing the opportunity from beginning to end, mobilize the masses of the entire commune to vigorously carry out "ground fire cage" seedling cultivation with "one heart, one mind, and one way" to achieve early sowing, early transplanting, and late stalk pulling as much as possible, extending the growing season and flowering period of cotton, and implementing heavy watering and fertilization to allow the cotton to produce more bolls and larger bolls. In the past, only autumn bolls were harvested, now we harvest summer bolls, autumn bolls and winter bolls. In the past, cotton bolls had only three or four petals, now they have six, seven, or eight petals, and the large ones have twelve petals, as big as oranges. In the past, 400 cotton bolls were needed to produce one jin of ginned cotton, now only 240 are needed, and the large ones need only 180 cotton bolls to produce one jin. This improved variety has been widely promoted this year. With this experience, 80% of the cotton is cultivated using "ground fire cage" seedling cultivation, and the sowing has been moved up earlier than last year. The cultivated cotton began to be transplanted in January. Now it generally has grown seven or eight true leaves and will soon bloom. It is estimated that the flowering period can be extended from the past 90 days to more than 180 days. We are fully confident that cotton will have an even greater harvest than last year.

In the above, I just want to simply explain why I dare to pat my chest and say that we are confident in completing the 1960 production leap forward plan and that we are likely to overfulfill the plan. If we want to talk about favorable conditions, there are many more that should be mentioned. For example, before the communization, the chemical fertilizers we used were entirely supplied by the state. Now we use twice as much chemical fertilizer as in the past, but it is mainly supplied by our own fertilizer plant, which saves funds and reduces the burden on the state. Last winter, we repaired all the dikes and recently completed a reservoir that can irrigate 8,000 to 9,000 mu of land, which will make it easier to cope with a drought as severe as last year. In addition, we have fully realized the improvement of varieties; the land has also been generally deep-plowed to more than one chi, and many have also been processed, and each piece of land has been identified. I think all of these are favorable conditions for us to complete our production tasks this year.

If we want to talk about favorable conditions, the most favorable condition is of course the vast number of cadres and commune members, because, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, the masses of the people are the most active factor in the production process. Last winter, under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in conjunction with current production, all cadres and all commune members were given a communist education. Through this education, the socialist and communist consciousness has been generally improved, and the roots of the People's Commune have been planted deeper in everyone's minds. A folk song once sang: "The Party and we are of one heart, the commune is the root of our life." This is the true intention of our vast number of commune members, and it is also the most favorable condition for us to strive for an all-round leap forward in production this year.

The above speech, is it correct? Please criticize and correct me, representatives.

    一大二公　灾害低头
    张泗洲代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念和谭震林副总理代表国务院作的三个报告。这三个报告，是继续跃进的报告，是鼓干劲的报告，在总的精神上，简直跟我们农民弟兄想的说的完全一样。
    在1958年、1959年连续大跃进的基础上，我们四川省简阳县棉丰人民公社早已经计划好，今年要播种大春粮食作物一万零三百七十一亩，确保总产量达到一千三百二十多万斤，力争达到一千五百万斤，比1959年增产50％到70％；播种棉花七千四百二十九亩，在保证粮食增产的前提下，确保总产量达到皮棉九十六万多斤，力争达到一百一十万斤，比1959年增产30％到50％。同时，大搞指挥田、试验田、丰产路、丰产片、棉花王，攀登大面积高产的高峰。今年已计划种植一百亩亩产一千斤皮棉到双千斤皮棉的高产试验田。其他各种作物和毛猪家禽，也要大大提高产量，同时还要把社办工业搞好，来一个全面跃进。
    我们这个生产计划，我相信是完全办得到的，还有可能超额完成任务。因为在夺取1959年粮食、棉花大丰收中，全部事实已经证明，人民公社这个法宝，是经得起考验的。我指的是去年的旱灾。去年的旱灾，是几十年没有过的，从1月到6月，没有下过一场透雨，棉花叶子晒得起“狗耳朵”，大部分稻田都断水了。棉丰耕区有个李么奶奶已经九十多岁了，一天只顾叹气，说：“完全跟壬寅年一个样，今年庄稼又没事了”。过去旧社会出过的灾荒景象，使得老太婆很害怕，担心又会要饿死多少人。
    好在我们那里只有一个李么奶奶这样的人，其余绝大多数社员，不但有了公共食堂心里就不慌了，而且信心照样是很强的，他们完全相信人民公社无穷无尽的威力。全社工农商学兵坚决响应了省委“抗旱保苗”的号召，使用了一切抗旱工具，大至抽水机，小到盆盆罐罐，在烈日下抽水打水，加紧灌溉，一齐向旱祸进行斗争。经过一百多天的艰苦奋斗，我们终于基本上做到了一块不干，一窝不缺，一苗不死，战胜了旱灾，叫粮食产量比1958年的特大跃进增产49％；棉花比1958年的特大跃进增产20％，实现了平均亩产一百斤皮棉的生产指标。
    1959年我们不止遭过几十年没有过的旱灾，同时，还遭过一场洪水。因为我们那里是丘陵地区，土质又坏，每每不旱就涝，或者又旱又涝。去年的情形就是这样。旱灾刚被战胜，一到7月暴雨又扑爬筋斗来了，又快又猛，短短的一两天，就爆发了山洪。看到这个情形，公社党委即时发出了“变水害水利”的号召，一支防洪蓄水大军就又立刻冲锋陷阵起来，守堤护埂，堵漏抢险，开沟行水，能蓄就蓄。结果把坏事变成了好事，被蓄起来的水，对去年农作物的灌溉，对今年的大、小春用水，都发挥了很大的作用。
    用不上说，光靠干劲是不够的，可是，很多事实证明，人民公社化后，广大干部、社员，不止干劲比1958年更大了，而且在改造技术、钻研科学的精神，也更足了。对夺取1959年粮棉大丰收，同样起过重大作用。我们社太平、共和、大石三个耕区，有五百亩水灾地，往往雨水一多就没了，种了等于白种。1959年1月根据社里气象站预报的降雨资料，在有关部门的协助下，我们计算到7月下旬的雨量，会达到二、三百公厘左右。也就是说，这五百亩地的大春，就是种上了收成也不保险。不过，这是就过去旧社会的情况说的。现在，我们既然已经认识了自然规律，也就有办法利用自然规律。我们很快就组织社员进行讨论，如何使这五百亩水灾地也要收好庄稼？讨论结果，大家提出种早玉米，在时间上把雨季抛在后面，跟着我们就动员广大群众在几天之内全部抢种了早玉米，等到暴雨到来，对不起，我们的玉米已经收了。暴雨一过，我们接着又种了两百多亩地的冬玉米和两百多亩地的蔬菜，结果这五百亩水灾地获得了大丰收，亩产量折合原粮一千五百斤，很多老年人都认为这是奇迹，只有人民公社时代才办得到。
    在1958年、1959年连续两年的跃进中，我们在技术革新、科学研究方面，当然还不止上面说到的一些东西。这里我只想补充一点，在棉花生产上，我们大走群众路线，大搞技术革新，根据本地的自然条件和棉花的生理特性，经过不断试验，已经摸到了一条提高棉花产量的经验。这就是：遵照省委指示，一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧的精神，发动全社群众“一条心、一股劲、一个样”地大搞“地火笼”育苗，尽量做到早播种、早移栽，迟拔秆，延长棉花的生长期和开花期，实行大水大肥，叫棉花多结桃，结大桃。过去只收伏桃，现在要收夏桃、伏桃、秋桃三种桃。过去棉桃只有三、四瓣，现在有六、七、八瓣，大的达十二瓣，就像广柑那么大。过去要四百个棉桃才有一斤皮棉，现在只要二百四十个，大的一百八十个棉桃就有一斤。今年已经普遍推广了这种良种。这个经验，有80％的棉花都实行了“地火笼”育苗，并且又比去年提前下了种，育的棉花1月份就开始移栽了。现在一般已长了七、八片真叶，很快就要开花了。估计开花期能够由过去的九十天延长到一百八十多天。我们完全有把握叫棉花比去年得到更大的丰收。
    以上的话，我只想简单讲明，为什么我敢拍胸口，说我们有把握完成1960年的生产跃进计划。并且有可能超额完成计划。如果要讲有利条件，应该讲的还多得很。比如，公社化前，我们用的化肥完全是靠国家供应的，现在用的化肥比过去多一倍，可是主要是自己化肥厂供应了，又节省了资金，又减轻了国家的负担；去年冬天，我们已经修整了全部的埝塘，最近又完工了一座水库，可以灌溉八、九千亩土地，如果再碰到去年那样大的旱灾，也就更容易对付了。此外，我们已全部实现了良种化；土地也普遍深耕到一尺以上，有不少的还加了工，又对每块土地做了鉴定。我觉得所有这些，都是我们今年完成生产任务的有利条件。
    要讲有利条件，最有利的条件当然还是要数广大干部和社员，因为，正像李富春副总理在报告中说的，人民群众在生产过程中是最活跃的因素。去年冬天，在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，结合当前生产，对全体干部，全体社员进行了一次共产主义教育。通过这次教育，社会主义、共产主义觉悟普遍有所提高，在大家思想上，人民公社的根子扎得更加深了。有首民歌曾经唱道：“党和我们心连心，公社是我们命根根”。这就是我们广大社员的真实心意，同时也是我们今年在生产上争取全面跃进的最有利的条件。
    以上发言，是不是对，请代表们批评指正。
