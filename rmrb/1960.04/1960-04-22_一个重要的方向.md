	An Important Direction
	By a Commentator of This Newspaper
	In September 1958, when Chairman Mao inspected Hubei, he instructed: "Large enterprises like Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation can gradually be developed into comprehensive joint enterprises. In addition to producing various steel products, they should also engage in some mechanical industry, chemical industry, and construction industry, etc." Now, more than a year has passed, and Chairman Mao's great vision has begun to be realized. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Baotou Steel, etc., are not only producing steel and iron; they are also producing cement and refractory materials, and have also set up some mechanical industries. From the news about Huainan City smelting iron from coke made from coal published in yesterday's newspaper, we also see that a city that originally only produced coal is developing into a comprehensive industrial city centered on the coal industry, with steel, coke, machinery, and chemical industries.
	This is a major event, representing an important direction. It seems that all large enterprises should develop in the direction of comprehensive joint enterprises.
	However, some comrades doubt this direction. They believe that diversified operations violate the laws of socio-economic development of specialized division of labor, and are not a direction forward but a regression. We say: these comrades are wrong. Yes, with the development of productive forces, the division of labor in the social economy becomes more and more detailed, which is an objective law. However, division of labor and collaboration are twin sisters. Since the existence of division of labor, there has been a demand for collaboration, but the content and methods of collaboration are different in different societies. May I ask which specialized enterprise can survive and develop independently without the collaboration of other enterprises? None. The production of any enterprise in the world requires collaboration. Requiring collaboration also requires self-reliance. The spirit of collaboration should be greatly promoted. But we are not "伸手派 (those who reach out)," nor "eyes-looking-outward派 (those who only look outward)." We advocate collaboration, and we also advocate self-reliance. Specialized division of labor is the inevitable result of the development of the economic base, while mutual collaboration and self-reliance are the inevitable trend of the superstructure adapting to the development of the economic base. Simply relying on collaboration and neglecting self-reliance can only hinder the development of productive forces, not promote it.
	Now, we have a large number of eloquent facts to prove that developing in the direction of comprehensive joint enterprises has only advantages and no disadvantages. Huainan smelting iron from coke made from coal, built coke plants and iron smelting plants, and also set up a bit of steelmaking industry and steel rolling industry. This has not only not hindered the development of the coal industry but has also promoted it. In the past, the transportation above ground could not keep up with the production underground, which limited the increase in coal production. Now, the mined coal can be directly sent to be coked, and the underground production is no longer restricted by the transportation above ground. Isn't this very good? The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory in Sichuan Province has established fourteen satellite factories since 1958 and has also developed into a comprehensive joint enterprise. Lacking steel in their production, they engaged in iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling; lacking refractory materials for iron smelting and steelmaking, they engaged in refractory materials. As a result, the factory's production capacity of measuring and cutting tools has increased three times compared to the designed capacity. One-third of the high-quality steel and medium-carbon steel needed for production is solved by this comprehensive joint enterprise itself. Isn't this even better?
	The development of large enterprises towards comprehensive joint enterprises is not only very good for the production of the enterprises themselves, but also very good for the country. This approach greatly saves transportation capacity. In the past, Huainan coal was transported to Ma'anshan, and empty cars returned. Now, the return cars are used to load ore. In the past, Huainan transported coal out, now it can transport coke. Two tons of coal are used to refine one ton of coke, and the number of train cars saved is halved. More importantly, this approach can form a small industrial system around large enterprises, which is more conducive to the development of the local economy. When Huainan was just a coal-producing city, it was difficult to drive the entire economic cause of the Huainan region. Now that Huainan has developed into a comprehensive industrial city, isn't the situation completely different?
	It can be seen that large enterprises, in addition to mainly producing their own specialized products, should vigorously engage in diversified operations and develop in the direction of comprehensive joint enterprises. This is not a "regression," but a great step forward. It is not a violation of the laws of economic development, but is precisely in line with the laws of economic development. The view that separates things, believing that coal mines should not smelt any iron, and steel plants should not engage in any chemical industry or mechanical industry, is a metaphysical view.
	Diversified operations and development in the direction of comprehensive joint enterprises are also a prerequisite for the comprehensive utilization of resources and an inevitable trend of continuous progress in science and technology. Many materials inherently have multiple uses, but due to the limitations of people's understanding of nature, for a long time, only one aspect of these materials has been used, while their more uses have been abandoned. With the development of science and technology, people's understanding of nature is becoming more and more profound. Many waste materials, waste gas, waste oil, and waste residue have been proven to be not waste but treasure. The comprehensive utilization of resources has become a symbol of the improvement of industrial technology. However, to achieve the comprehensive utilization of resources, it is necessary to break the mechanical division of labor and develop diversified operations. If a coking plant does not engage in a little chemical industry, how can the comprehensive utilization of coal be realized? If a steel plant does not engage in a little construction industry, how can a large amount of slag be utilized? It can be seen that, from the perspective of the development of science and technology, the development of large enterprises towards comprehensive joint enterprises is also not a "regression," but a great step forward. It does not run counter to the development trend of science and technology, but adapts to the development trend of science and technology.
	Large enterprises have strong strength and can easily set up some small "foreign groups" and "local groups" of other industries; and it is of great benefit to the development of enterprise production, the development of the local economy, and the development of the entire national construction cause. Such a good thing should be done on a large scale. It is hoped that all large enterprises will use both foreign and indigenous methods to rapidly develop in the direction of comprehensive joint enterprises!

    一个重要的方向
    本报评论员
    1958年9月，毛主席在湖北视察的时候曾经指示说：“像武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成综合性的联合企业，除生产多种钢铁产品外，还要办点机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业等。”现在，一年多的时间过去了，毛主席的这个伟大的设想开始实现了。武钢、包钢等已经不只生产钢和铁，他们也生产水泥、耐火材料，也办了一点机械工业。从昨天本报发表的淮南市就煤炼焦炼铁的新闻中，我们也看到一个本来是只生产煤炭的城市，正在发展成一个以煤炭工业为中心，又有钢铁、又有焦炭、又有机械工业、又有化学工业的综合性的工业城市。
    这是一件大事，它代表着一个重要的方向。看起来，一切大型企业都要向综合性的联合企业的方向发展。
    然而，有些同志对这个方向是感到怀疑的。他们认为多种经营违背了专业分工的社会经济发展规律，不是方向，是倒退。我们说：这些同志的想法错了。是的，随着生产力的发展，社会经济的分工越来越细，这是客观规律。但是，分工和协作是一对孪生姐妹。自有分工以来，就有了协作的要求，只不过在不同的社会，协作的内容和方式各不相同。试问那一个专业企业可以不需要别的企业的协作而能独立的生存和发展呢？不能的。世界上任何企业的生产都需要协作。需要协作，也就需要自力更生。协作的精神是要大大发扬的。但是我们不是“伸手派”，不是“眼睛朝外派”。我们提倡协作，也提倡自力更生。专业分工是经济基础发展的必然结果，相互协作和自力更生则是上层建筑适应经济基础发展的必然趋势。单纯依赖协作而忽视自力更生，只能束缚生产力的发展，而不能促进生产力的发展。
    现在，我们已经有了大量雄辩的事实，可以证明朝综合性的联合企业的方向发展，是有百利而无一弊的。淮南就煤炼焦炼铁，办了炼焦厂、炼铁厂，还办了点炼钢工业、轧钢工业，非但没有妨碍煤炭工业的发展，而且促进了煤炭工业的发展。从前是井上运输跟不上井下生产，限制了煤炭产量的提高，现在采出煤来就可以直接送去炼焦，井下生产不再受井上运输的限制了。这不是好得很吗？四川省有一个成都量具刃具厂，从1958年以来，建立了十四个卫星厂，也发展成一个综合性的联合企业。他们的生产缺少钢材，就搞炼铁、炼钢、轧钢；炼铁、炼钢缺耐火材料，就搞耐火材料。结果，全厂量具刃具的生产能力比设计能力提高了三倍。生产上需要的优质钢材和中炭钢材，有三分之一是这个综合性的联合企业自己解决的。这不更是好得很吗？
    大型企业朝综合性的联合企业发展，不仅对企业本身的生产来说好得很；对国家来说，也是好得很的。这种做法，大大节省了运力。从前淮南煤运到马鞍山去，回来的是空车，现在利用回空车装来了矿石。从前淮南往外运煤，现在可以运焦，两吨煤炼一吨焦，车皮就节省了一半。更重要的是，这种做法，可以围绕着大型企业，形成一个小的工业体系，更加有利于地方经济的发展。当淮南只是一个产煤的城市时，它很难把淮南地区的经济事业全部带动起来。现在淮南已经发展成一个综合性的工业城市，情况不是就完全不同了吗？
    可见，大型企业在主要生产自己的专业产品以外，大搞多种经营，朝综合性的联合企业的方向发展，不是什么“倒退”，而是大大地前进了一步，不是违反了经济发展的规律，而是恰恰符合经济发展的规律的。那种把事物割裂开来，认为煤矿就不应该炼一点铁，钢铁厂就不应该办一点化学工业、机械工业的观点，是形而上学的观点。
    多种经营，朝综合性的联合企业的方向发展，又是资源综合利用的前提，是科学技术不断进步的必然趋势。许许多多的物资，本来都具有多种用途，只是由于人们认识自然的局限性，在很长的时间内只使用了这些物资某一方面的用途，而舍弃了它们的更多的用途。随着科学技术的发展，人们对自然界的认识愈来愈深刻了。许多废料、废气、废油、废渣，都被证明不是废物而是宝贝。资源的综合利用成为工业技术水平提高的标志。但是，要实现资源的综合利用，就要打破机械的专业分工，发展多种经营。如果炼焦厂不办一点化学工业，怎么能实现煤炭的综合利用呢？如果钢铁厂不办一点建筑工业，大量的炉渣怎么能被利用起来呢？可见，从科学技术的发展来看，大型企业朝综合性的联合企业发展，也不是“倒退”，而是大大地前进了一步，不是同科学技术的发展趋势背道而驰，而是同科学技术的发展趋势相适应的。
    大型企业实力雄厚，办一点小洋群、小土群的别的工业，轻而易举；而对于企业生产的发展，对于地方经济的发展，对于整个国家建设事业的发展，却有莫大的好处。这样的好事，应该大办特办。希望一切大型企业都用洋土并举的办法，迅速朝综合性的联合企业的方向发展！
