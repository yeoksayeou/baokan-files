Leading Abundant Yield Plots with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
Li Jiping, First Secretary of the CCP Liaocheng Prefectural Committee

    The abundant yield plot movement is a movement for the high-speed development of agricultural production, as well as a movement for continuously increasing basic construction in agricultural production, continuously carrying out technological reforms, and continuously improving operation and management. It is also a movement for continuously improving the political and ideological, cultural, and technical levels of commune members. We must use the spirit of continuous revolution to push this movement from one climax to a newer climax.
    From the very beginning of the abundant yield plot movement, we can see a wave-like progressive development trend where each wave is higher than the last. Here is the situation of a people's commune carrying out the abundant yield plot movement:
    The Lao Zhao Zhuang People's Commune in Linqing City, Shandong Province, is one of the earliest communes in the Liaocheng area to carry out the abundant yield plot movement. In this commune, at the beginning of 1958, there were only some small-area high-yield experimental fields. These experimental fields greatly increased unit yields at an unconventional high speed, demonstrating great power. In the summer of 1958, they rapidly developed into large-area abundant yield plots. In 1958, 20,000 mu of cotton abundant yield plots were established, accounting for 32.8% of the total cotton field area, but the harvest accounted for 46% of the total output. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the plots was 112 jin, 73.6% higher than that of cotton fields outside the plots. In 1959, the area of cotton abundant yield plots developed to 46,000 mu, accounting for 80% of the total cotton field area, and the harvest accounted for 89.67% of the total output. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the plots was 150 jin, 108.3% higher than that of cotton fields outside the plots. In the same year, 11,000 mu of wheat abundant yield plots were also established, accounting for 33% of the wheat field area, and the harvest accounted for 76.2% of the total output. The average yield per mu was 466 jin, 185% higher than that of fields outside the plots. Facts have proven that vigorously developing abundant yield plots is the most appropriate form of leading agricultural production after the people's communes, which makes the superiority of the people's communes more fully utilized. In just over two years, 90% of the land in the Lao Zhao Zhuang Commune has been transformed into abundant yield plots for grain, cotton, and vegetables. Of the seven large teams in the commune, four, including Liming, have incorporated all their wheat, cotton, and vegetables into abundant yield plots, and all grain crops and cotton abundant yield plots are over 1,000 mu. While the abundant yield plots are rapidly becoming popular, large areas of land within the abundant yield plots have continued to reach higher standards of garden-like cultivation and have obtained higher yields, becoming a higher level of abundant yield plots within the abundant yield plots. The unit yield is 50% to 80% higher than the average unit yield of all abundant yield plots.
    From the beginning of the abundant yield plot movement, the Lao Zhao Zhuang People's Commune established "plots within plots" in the abundant yield plots. These "plots within plots" promoted the continuous expansion of the area of the abundant yield plots, the continuous improvement of the level of operation and management, and the continuous leap forward in production. The area of these "plots within plots" ranges from dozens of mu to hundreds of mu, and even one or two thousand mu. Their basic conditions are similar to other abundant yield fields in the abundant yield plots, but they are directly led by the party committee secretaries at all levels. In 1959, the entire commune planted 33,000 mu of wheat, established 11,000 mu of abundant yield plots, and set up 2,500 mu of "plots within plots."
    The "plots within plots" largely adopted the basic farmland construction and technical management measures that the Liming Brigade had achieved in a small-area experimental field in 1958 with a wheat yield of 630 jin per mu. As a result, the yield per mu reached 645 jin; among them, dozens of mu of measures were doubled, and the yield was even higher. In the same year, 3,200 mu of "plots within plots" were established in the cotton abundant yield plots, and the yield-increasing measures of 290 jin of ginned cotton per mu in the 2.2 mu experimental field in 1958 were adopted. As a result, the yield of ginned cotton per mu was 248 jin.
    The "plots within plots" played a driving role in the production of all abundant yield plots and the production outside the plots. During the key periods of the production process, according to the growth and development of crops in the abundant yield plots, the key was grasped and broken through. The "plots within plots" took the lead in making a model, and then convened on-site meetings attended by cadres of various abundant yield plot professional teams and work groups, while also absorbing cadres who manage production outside the plots to participate, improve their thinking, exchange experiences, impart technology, and organize competitions. After breaking through one key, closely grasp the next key, without letting go of one link or giving way one step, tightly interlocking each link, and keeping up step by step, naturally forming a large-scale abundant yield movement with the "plots within plots" as the center, the abundant yield plots as the base, and driving the general fields.
    A part of the small squares are also delimited as experimental fields in the abundant yield plots. Generally, there are fewer than a few mu, and more than forty mu, depending on the size of the technical strength of the production team and the number of experimental projects. The task of this experimental field is mainly to engage in agricultural science and technology experiments and research, and the material conditions and technical conditions are relatively high. There are mainly two types of experimental projects: one is single-factor experiments, such as comparative experiments on good varieties, sowing dates, density, planting methods, different fertilizer application amounts, different watering methods, different deep plowing degrees, etc.; the other is comprehensive experiments of various measures, that is, comprehensive experiments to fully implement the Eight-Character Constitution of Agriculture based on the local accumulated experience in increasing production over the years and absorbing advanced experience from other places. The experimental fields are combined with cadres, advanced farmers, and technicians to form a professional group to conduct detailed scientific management. The experimental field not only provides technical experience for high-yield production for the abundant yield plots, but also can use facts to remove ideological obstacles on the road to progress, and encourage cadres and the masses to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and boldly innovate and create. Therefore, the masses also call the experimental field the "four dares field" (dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to be).
    Open up the road with experimental fields, break through key points with "plots within plots," and drive the fields outside the plots with the entire abundant yield plot. In this way, the improvement and popularization are combined. Improve - popularize - improve, balance - imbalance - balance, wave-like development, spiral-shaped rise, endless cycle, continuous leap forward. The abundant yield plots developed from small areas to large areas, low-yield fields became high-yield fields, and high-yield fields reached higher yields. The achievements of the abundant yield plots have inspired the enthusiasm of the commune members, and the enthusiasm of the commune members has made the abundant yield plots strive for perfection, seek higher yields, continuously revolutionize, and move forward forever.

    用不断革命精神领导丰产方
    中共聊城地委第一书记　李吉平
    丰产方运动，是高速度发展农业生产的运动，又是农业生产上的一个不断增加基本建设、不断进行技术改革、不断改进经营管理的运动，也是不断提高社员的政治思想和文化技术水平的运动。我们要用不断革命的精神，把这个运动从一个高潮推向一个更新的高潮。
    从丰产方运动一开始，就可以看到一浪更比一浪高的波浪式前进的发展趋势。这里是一个人民公社开展丰产方运动的情况：
    山东临清市老赵庄人民公社，在聊城地区是开展丰产方运动最早的一个公社。在这个社， 1958年初还只有一些小面积的高额丰产试验田。这些试验田以打破常规的高速度大大提高了单位产量，显示了巨大的威力，在1958年夏季就迅速发展为大面积丰产方。1958年建立棉花丰产方二万亩，占总棉田面积的32.8％，收获量却占总产量的46％，方内平均单产皮棉一百一十二斤，高于方外棉田73.6％。1959年棉花丰产方的面积发展到四万六千亩，占总棉田面积的80％，收获量占总产量的89.67％，方内每亩平均单产皮棉一百五十斤，高于方外棉田108.3％。这一年还建立小麦丰产方一万一千亩，占麦田面积的33％，收获量占总产的76.2％，每亩平均单产四百六十六斤，高于方外田185％。事实证明，大搞丰产方是人民公社化以后领导农业生产的最适当的形式，它使人民公社的优越性更充分地发挥了出来。仅仅两年多的时间，老赵庄公社的土地，已经有90％变成了粮食、棉花、蔬菜的丰产方。全社七个大队，已有黎明等四个大队全部小麦、棉花、蔬菜都纳入了丰产方，所有粮食作物和棉花丰产方都在千亩以上。就在丰产方迅速普及的同时，丰产方内又有大片的土地继续达到了更高的园田化的标准，得到了更高的产量，成为丰产方中更高一级的丰产方，单位产量比全部丰产方的平均单位产量还高50％以至80％以上。
    老赵庄人民公社的丰产方运动一开始，就在丰产方内建立了“方内方”。这些“方内方”促进着丰产方的面积不断扩大，经营管理水平不断提高，生产不断跃进。这些“方内方”的面积，有几十亩的，有几百亩的，也有一两千亩的。它们的基础条件同丰产方里的其它丰产田差不多，只是由各级党委书记直接领导。1959年，全公社共种小麦三万三千亩，建立丰产方一万一千亩，其中设立“方内方”二千五百亩。
    “方内方”大规模地采取了黎明大队1958年在小面积试验田获得亩产小麦六百三十斤的农田基本建设和技术管理措施，结果每亩产量达到六百四十五斤；其中有几十亩措施加倍，产量更高。同年在棉花丰产方内设立“方内方”三千二百亩，采用了1958年二亩二分试验田亩产皮棉二百九十斤的增产措施，结果每亩产皮棉二百四十八斤。
    “方内方”对全部丰产方的生产和方外的生产都起了带动的作用。在生产过程中的关键时期，根据丰产方农作物生长发育的情况，抓关键，破关键，在“方内方”先行一步，作出样子，然后召开各个丰产方专业队、作业组干部参加的现场会议，同时也吸收管理方外生产的干部参加，提高思想，交流经验，传授技术，组织竞赛。破一个关键之后，紧紧抓住下一个关键，一环不放，一步不让，环环扣紧，步步跟上，自然就形成了以“方内方”为中心，以丰产方为基地，带动一般田的大面积丰产运动。
    在丰产方内还划出一部分小方作为试验田。一般少的几亩，多的四十多亩，以生产队的技术力量大小和试验项目多少而定。这种试验田的任务主要是从事农业科学技术的试验研究，物质条件、技术条件都比较高。试验的项目主要有两类：一类是单因子试验，如良种、播种期、密度、种植方式、不同施肥量、不同浇水方法、不同深翻程度等等对比试验；另一类是各项措施的综合试验，就是根据当地历年积累的增产经验和吸取外地的先进经验，进行全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法的综合试验。试验田都是干部、先进农民、技术员相结合，组成专业组，进行细致的科学的管理。试验田不仅为丰产方提供高额丰产的技术经验，而且能够用事实扫除前进道路上的思想障碍，鼓舞干部和群众破除迷信，解放思想，大胆革新、大胆创造。因此，群众把试验田也叫做“四敢田”（敢想，敢说，敢作，敢为）。
    以试验田开辟道路，以“方内方”攻破关键，以整个丰产方带动方外田。这样，就把提高和普及结合了起来。提高—普及—提高，平衡—不平衡—平衡，波浪式的发展，螺旋形的上升，循环不息，持续跃进。丰产方由小面积发展到大面积，低产田变成高产田，高产田达到更高产。丰产方的成就鼓舞了社员群众的干劲，社员群众的干劲使丰产方精益求精，高益求高，不断革命，永远前进。
