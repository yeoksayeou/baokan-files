    Leap Forward Flowers Bloom Everywhere
    Speech by Committee Member Fu Daoshen

    Chairman, esteemed committee members:

    I wholeheartedly endorse the important reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, and I fully agree with the Standing Committee work report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    This spring, under the instruction of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, I participated in the Spring Festival慰问团慰问 (consolation) activities of the Yulin branch of our province. Taking this opportunity, I visited the long-admired revolutionary holy land—Yan'an, as well as Qingjian, Suide, Mizhi, Yulin and other cities, and visited many grassroots units in industry, transportation, finance, and trade, personally witnessing many new people and new things. Although these are examples from a corner of northern Shaanxi, they fully demonstrate the power of the Party's general line for building socialism is far-reaching and without exception, it reaches even remote areas. At the same time, it shows that the Party's general line, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune are indeed the three magic weapons for our country's construction of socialism. Because I stayed in the Yulin area for a long time this time, I came into contact with many things, and the inspiration and education for me was also very deep. Now I will only briefly report to the conference on some of the situations I personally saw in the suburbs of Yulin.

    Before I went to Yulin, I always thought that Yulin was just an ancient city on the frontier, and it must be desolate, just like the ancient texts described as "vast, boundless sandy plains." After arriving in Yulin, it was unexpectedly beyond my expectation. Whether it is in municipal construction or in the construction of industry, transportation, finance, and trade, a brand-new situation has emerged. What impressed me the most was:

    Turning Deserts into Fertile Fields, Transforming the Frontier into Jiangnan

    For the Yulin area, "water" is the lifeline. How to turn "poor mountains and bad waters" into "beautiful gardens" is the most urgent requirement and desire of the local people. Therefore, after the establishment of the People's Commune, the local people enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to "march towards nature and declare war on the desert," rushing to the front line, fearing no difficulties, and working day and night to build water conservancy projects, build reservoirs, engage in large-scale soil and water conservation, large-scale greening, and fish farming. They boldly sang: "Our two hands can have whatever we want. We can move mountains, we can reverse water flow, we can dress barren mountains with brocade, and we can dress the earth with colorful silk." The heroic people of the heroic era can do what they say. Now Yulin has crisscrossing canals. They adopt comprehensive measures such as diverting water to pull sand, flushing sand to make land, diverting floods to inundate land, planting trees, planting grass, and applying fertilizer to transform more than 4.8 million mu of sandy land. New rice fields and new pastures appear in large areas, and turning deserts into fertile fields has become a reality. The so-called frontier scenery of the past will soon become the scenery of Jiangnan; turning the desert into a land of fish and rice is not a distant thing. The reason why Yulin's farmland water conservancy construction work has achieved remarkable results in just a few years is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, just as the local people sing: "In the past there was King Yu, now there is the Communist Party, dry land becomes paddy fields, and we will never rely on heaven." From this, it can be seen how their gratitude to the Party and the government is overflowing.

    A New Atmosphere Inside and Outside the Great Wall, Happy Faces in the Borderland Homes

    Although this is a Spring Festival couplet posted by a household during the Spring Festival, it represents the heartfelt words that all the people in the Yulin area want to say. It will not only become a rural area with thousands of acres of fertile land, but also a beautiful city with factories standing like forests. In the past, Yulin could not talk about any industry at all. Before liberation, there was only a dilapidated ordnance repair shop of the puppet army, a practice workshop of an old vocational school, and some scattered carpet weaving workshops. Now it has completely changed. A small hydroelectric power plant has been built near the suburbs. Another thermal power plant is being built in the southern suburbs. In the mass steelmaking movement of the whole people in the year before last, many small iron plants and coal mines were set up. The era of "not having an inch of iron" is gone forever. In the Great Leap Forward, they started from scratch and set up a machinery manufacturing factory with bare hands. They pieced together the old stalls of the past to form a fine woolen textile factory. Other factories such as leather factories, cement factories, carpet factories, etc., have sprung up rapidly like mushrooms after a rain. In terms of municipal construction, Yulin has natural tap water, which is a spring water that gushes out from a high place, guided by iron pipes, and通至通至(passing through) streets, becomes tap water for the use of the city's residents, which is both convenient and hygienic. New cinemas, stadiums and other public activity places have been built in the city. All these earth-shaking changes have brought the people an infinitely beautiful life, just as they sing loudly: "Water flows in the mountains and rivers, terraced fields are full of mountain gullies, the fragrance of apples fills the mountains, fish swim in the ponds, plowing the land does not require cattle, lighting lamps does not require oil, sweet water is delivered all over the streets, music is heard in every household, there is no worry about eating or wearing clothes, and the mountain people will never have worries."

    The people are the creators of history

    Although I used to say this sentence often, I have never experienced it as deeply as I do today. I have been engaged in the textile industry for decades. In my mind, to engage in industry, one must understand science and technology (this is correct, but it does not mean worshipping science and technology); some important machinery and equipment must be allocated by higher authorities, and there is no way and no power to manufacture them oneself; small factories have poor conditions, and business management and product quality are not necessarily good. This just shows that my thinking has not been completely liberated. The facts educated me and enlightened me. I have a preliminary understanding that science and technology come from practice, and the people are the creators of science and technology. For example, during the installation process of the Yulin Hydropower Station, a technician suggested:

    "It is difficult to complete the task of installing a generator weighing several tons without bridge-type lifting equipment." Of course, this technician also thought of some other methods, but because the various equipment and equipment required did not meet the specifications, the conclusion was still "no way to do it." After the Party raised this issue to the masses, after several meetings and on-site observations, it was studied and concluded that: the poles and steel pipes were twisted together to make a tripod, and a five-ton chain hoist was used to adopt the method of lifting and padding at the same time, and the motor was installed in only two hours. The technician said with emotion: "This time, the native method of hoisting the motor has gained more than I have gained in more than ten years of hoisting work." As long as we have great ambitions, everything can be done. As the workers of Yulin Machinery Manufacturing Factory said well: "We create our own equipment if we don't have it." Indeed, in one year, they used native methods and a combination of native and foreign methods to make various planers, milling machines, forging hammers and other machine tools, and even heavy-duty round cars can be manufactured, basically arming themselves. The workers of Yulin Woolen Textile Factory manufactured several woolen loom machines by themselves. At that time, there were no drawings, so they adopted the method of making one, assembling one, and testing one, and finally successfully manufactured a woolen loom with thousands of parts. As long as you have the energy, you can create miracles. Yulin Machinery Manufacturing Factory, Woolen Textile Factory, Leather Factory, Carpet Factory, although these factories are small in scale, they all have great energy and are worthy of our study. Because of their painstaking management, they have made great progress in production management and product quality. Last year, some factories were rated as national or provincial red flag factories, some factories represented advanced units to attend the National Conference of Heroes, and some factory products were not only welcomed by the vast domestic consumers, but also sold well in overseas markets. All these show how precious people's energy is. As long as we rely closely on the broad masses of the people, we will have the power to move mountains and seas and overcome all difficulties.

    We must resolutely implement the general line of building socialism

    I have repeatedly considered that the reason why the people of the Yulin area can create countless new production records and miracles on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and why they can open a red and beautiful flower in the large garden of the motherland's socialist construction is not other, but because the Party's general line points out a bright and splendid road for the broad masses of the people. When people grasp the general line, they will have endless creativity; they will have a full and continuous revolutionary spirit; they will be able to give full play to subjective initiative; and they will be able to make full use of objective laws to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. In the past, although I had studied documents related to the general line, and I often talked about the general line in my daily work, my ideological understanding was still vague. For example, when I saw certain statistical figures, or heard about certain prominent examples in the Great Leap Forward, I held a skeptical attitude, thinking: "Is it an exaggeration?" "Is it a bit exaggerated?" This actually reflects my lack of understanding of the basic points of the general line—the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development—and ignores that "people" are the most active factor in the productive forces. Therefore, I always use my old experience and old vision to look at new things, which will inevitably lead to vacillation on the road of revolutionary struggle and inability to firmly follow the Party's instructions and move forward bravely. Therefore, a bourgeois intellectual like me must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen self-ideological transformation, actively participate in the fiery mass movement, continuously improve my ideological awareness, and establish a dialectical materialist worldview. In the future, in all work, we must rely closely on the leadership of the Party, learn from the masses with an open mind, and vigorously overcome our erroneous ideas such as being content with the status quo and not daring to take bold responsibility. In this way, we can better serve the people and contribute our strength to the greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward this year.

    Finally, I wish the conference a successful conclusion!

### 跃进花朵处处开  傅道伸委员的发言

    跃进花朵处处开
    傅道伸委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护国务院李富春副总理和李先念副总理在人大二届二次会议上所作的重要报告，并完全同意政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席所作的常委会工作报告。
    今春，在陕西省委的指示下，我参加了本省春节慰问团榆林分团的慰问活动。借此机会，我参观了久已向往的革命圣地——延安，以及清涧、绥德、米脂、榆林等城市，访问了许多工、交、财、贸等基层单位，亲眼看见了许多新人新事。这虽然是陕北一隅的事例，但是通过这些事例，充分地说明了党的建设社会主义总路线的威力是无远弗届，虽边远地区也不例外。同时也说明党的总路线、大跃进的发展速度、人民公社的组织形式，的确是我国建设社会主义的三大法宝。这次由于我留在榆林地区访问的时间较久，接触的事物较多，对我的启发教育也很深，现在我仅就榆林城郊亲眼看到的一些情况，向大会作一简单汇报。
    在我未去榆林以前，心目中总认为榆林只是边塞的一个古城，一定满目荒凉，就像古文中所描写的那样“浩浩乎、平沙无垠”。到榆林后，实出人意料之外，那儿无论在市政建设，或工、交、财、贸各个建设方面，都出现了一个崭新的局面，给我印象最深的是：
    化沙漠为良田，变塞外为江南
    对榆林地区来说，“水”就是命根子，如何把“穷山恶水”变为“美好园地”，是当地人民最迫切的要求和愿望。因此，在人民公社成立后，当地人民热烈地响应了党提出“向自然进军，向沙漠宣战”的号召，争先恐后地开赴最前线，不怕任何困难，夜以继日的大兴水利，修建水库，大搞水土保持，大搞绿化和养鱼等工作。他们豪迈的唱出：“我们的两只手，要啥啥就有，能让山搬家，能叫水倒流，能叫荒山披锦绣，能让大地穿彩绸”。英雄时代的英雄人民是说到就能做到。现在榆林是渠道纵横，他们采用引水拉沙，冲沙打地，引洪漫地和植树、种草、施肥等综合措施，改造了四百八十多万亩沙地，新稻田、新牧场成片地出现，变沙漠为良田，已成为事实。旧日所谓塞外风光，行将变为江南景色；把沙漠变为鱼米之乡，并非遥远的事情。榆林农田水利建设工作之所以能在短短几年内就取得显著的效果，主要是由于党的正确领导，即如当地人民所歌颂的：“从前有个夏禹王，如今有个共产党，旱地变水田，永远不靠天。”由此可见，他们对党和政府感激的心情是如何溢于言表。
    长城内外气象新，塞上人家喜洋洋
    这虽是春节时一户人家所贴的春联，但他代表所有榆林专区的人民要说的心里话。那里不仅将成为良田万顷的农村，而且将成为工厂林立的美丽城市。过去榆林根本谈不上什么工业。解放前只有一个破破烂烂的伪军修械所，一个旧职业学校的实习工场，一些零零散散的织地毯的作坊。现在却完全变了样，城郊附近建有小型水力发电厂一座，在城南郊另建有一座火力发电厂，在前年全民大炼钢铁的运动中，办起了许多小型铁厂和煤矿，“手无寸铁”的时代已一去不复返，在大跃进中，他们赤手空拳，白手起家办起了一个机械制造厂，他们将过去的旧摊摊七拼八凑地组成了一个出品优良的毛纺织厂。其他像制革厂、水泥厂、地毯厂等等，像雨后春笋似的，迅速地发展起来。在市政建设方面，榆林城内有天然自来水，系一股泉水自高处喷出，导以铁管，通至街衢，变成自来水，供全市居民饮水之用，既方便又卫生。城内新建有电影院、体育场等公共活动场所。所有这些翻天复地的改变，给人民带来了无限美好的生活，即如他们高声歌唱的那样：“水在山川流，梯田满山沟，遍山苹果香，鱼在池塘游，耕地不用牛，点灯不用油，甜水满街送，音乐家家听，吃不愁来穿不愁，高山人家永无忧。”
      人民群众是历史的创造者
    这句话，自己过去虽然也常在口中说，但没有像今天体会这样深刻。我从事纺织工业已经几十年了，在我心目中，搞工业必须要懂得科学技术（这是对的，但不等于迷信科学技术）；一些重要机器设备必须由上级调拨，自己没办法也没力量来制造；小厂条件差，经营管理和产品质量不一定好。这正说明了自己的思想还没有完全解放。事实教育了我，使我开了窍，我初步的认识到：科学技术是从实践中来的，人民群众是科学技术的创造者。如榆林水力发电站在安装过程中，一个技术人员提出：
    “安装几吨重的发电机，没有桥梁式的起重设备是很难完成工作任务的。”当然这个技术人员也想了一些其他办法，但由于所要的各项器材设备不合规格，结论还是个“没办法搞”。当党把这个问题向群众提出后，经过几次开会研究，现场观察，研究出：将电杆和钢管绞起来作了一个三角架，用一个五吨重倒链，采取边吊边垫的办法，只用两个多小时就将电机安装好了。这个技师感动的说：“这次土办法起重电机，比我搞十几年起重工作收获还大。”只要大立雄心壮志，一切都能办到。如榆林机械制造厂的职工说得好：“我们没有设备就自己动手创造”。的确他们在一年中用土办法和土洋结合的办法做了各种刨床、铣床、锻锤等母机，甚至丈二重型的圆车也能制造，基本上武装了自己。榆林毛纺织厂的职工自己制造了几台织呢机，当时没有图纸，就采用做一件，装一件，试一件的办法，终于将具有几千个零件的织呢机制成功。只要有干劲就能创造奇迹。榆林机械制造厂、毛纺织厂、皮革厂、地毯厂，这些厂子规模虽小，但是干劲都很大，是值得我们学习的。由于他们苦心经营，在生产管理和产品质量上都有很大的进步。去年有的厂被评为全国或全省的红旗厂，有的厂代表先进单位出席了全国群英会，有的厂的产品不但受到国内广大消费者的欢迎，而且畅销海外市场。所有这些，都说明了人的干劲是多么宝贵，只要紧紧依靠广大人民，我们就有移山倒海排除万难的力量。
    必须坚决贯彻建设社会主义的总路线
    我自己曾再三考虑，榆林地区的人民，在工农业战线上，所以能创造出无数新的生产纪录和奇迹，所以能在祖国社会主义建设大花园里，开出一支红艳的花朵，不是别的，这是因为党的总路线给广大人民指引了一条光明灿烂的道路。当人们掌握了总路线，就能有无穷无尽的创造力；就能有饱满的不断革命的精神；就能高度地发挥主观能动性；就能充分利用客观规律，多快好省地建设社会主义。过去，我虽然学习过有关总路线的文件，在日常工作中也经常谈论总路线，但思想认识还是模糊的。如当我看到某些统计数字，或听到大跃进中某些突出事例，就抱着将信将疑的态度，心想：“是不是言过其实？”“是不是有些夸大？”这实际上反映了自己对总路线的基本点——社会主义经济和政治、文化发展的客观规律性认识不足，忽视了“人”是生产力中最活跃的因素，因而处处用自己老经验、旧眼光来看新事物，这就必然会在革命斗争道路上东摇西摆，不能坚定意志遵循党的指示奋勇前进。因此，像我这样一个资产阶级知识分子，必须努力学习马列主义，特别是学习毛泽东思想，加强自我思想改造，积极地投身于火热的群众运动中去，不断提高自己的思想觉悟，树立起辩证唯物主义的世界观。今后在各项工作中必须紧紧地依靠党的领导，虚心向群众学习，大力克服自己安于现状，不敢大胆负责等错误思想。这样，才能更好的为人民服务，在今年更大更好更全面的大跃进中，贡献出自己的力量。
    最后，敬祝大会胜利成功！
