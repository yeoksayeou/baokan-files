Fellow Delegates:
    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft. Now, I will talk about the soil and water conservation work in Gansu.

    Based on the work of the past few years, and after the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, soil and water conservation in Gansu has developed from the treatment of individual gullies and slopes to a new stage of large-scale comprehensive treatment by river basins and mountain systems, linking communes and counties. The characteristics of this stage are the organization of large-scale, large-army, large-cooperation mass movements, in accordance with the requirements of high efficiency, high speed, high standards, and high quality, to carry out centralized treatment, comprehensive treatment, integrated treatment, blitz treatment, and continuous treatment. Last winter and this spring, 2.9 million people vigorously engaged in water conservancy and soil and water conservation movements. In just a few months, the newly treated area reached 30,000 square kilometers, equivalent to more than one-third of the total achievements of the past ten years. The area of consolidated and improved land was more than 20,000 square kilometers, exceeding the total achievements of the past ten years. After this battle, the total treated area in the province increased to 110,000 square kilometers, accounting for 65% of the total area of soil erosion. Of the 126,000 square kilometers of soil erosion area in the Yellow River basin, 89,000 square kilometers have been treated, of which 40,000 square kilometers have significant effects. The amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River can be reduced by more than 100 million tons. The Great Leap Forward in soil and water conservation has greatly accelerated the process of changing the arid face of Gansu, promoted the great development of agriculture, and played a significant role in this year's drought resistance and production. At the same time, it has also contributed more to the fundamental control of the Yellow River.

    Large-scale mass movements for soil and water conservation have created many models for large-scale treatment by river basins and mountain systems. Here, I will briefly introduce three projects: Huajialing, Zuli River, and Dongzhiyuan.

    Huajialing is a typical example of large-scale centralized treatment by mountain system. Starting in 1958, this area organized the large-scale cooperation of four counties, mobilizing more than 30,000 people, and battled for forty days. In 1959, it continued to carry out comprehensive treatment and consolidation. The treatment method is to build square terraced fields and reverse-slope terraced fields on barren hills and slopes, plant trees, and plant pasture. Terraces are built on slopes. Ponds are built on mountainsides and roadsides to store water for irrigation. Gulches are repaired into terraces and reservoirs. This treatment effect is very good. In July 1959, it successfully resisted a rainstorm of 150 millimeters, and more than 90% of the project stood firm. The slope terraces have achieved large-scale harvests. Now, 841 square kilometers have been fully treated. The mountains have become terraces, the gullies have become terraces, and the mountains are full of newly planted trees and grass belts. Many parks have also been built on the top of the mountains. The masses of Huajialing praised: "Soil and water conservation has many benefits, the Great Leap Forward blossoms into victorious fruits, the green mountains and rivers make the crops good, and life is getting better and better."

    The Zuli River is a typical example of large-scale centralized treatment by river basin. The basin area is very large, and soil erosion is very serious. It is the most arid area in Gansu. On the basis of the treatment in the past few years, after comprehensive planning, in the winter of 1959, 120,000 people were organized to vigorously engage in water conservancy and soil and water conservation movements, treating 3,000 square kilometers at a time. The treatment method is to comprehensively treat gullies, slopes, plant trees and grass, combine flood irrigation and the construction of large, medium, and small reservoirs in the main and tributary streams. At present, more than one million mu of terraced fields have been built, 1.5 million mu of forests have been planted, and more than 5,600 small reservoirs and ponds, and seven medium-sized reservoirs have been completed. More than 1,900 hairy tributaries have been treated. 150,000 mu of new irrigated land and 320,000 mu have been renovated. In many places, terraced fields are connected, gully dams are in series, ponds and cellars are networked, reservoirs and canals are connected, and slopes and gullies are greened, which can not only block floods but also irrigate cultivated land, showing a beautiful prospect for the entire basin.

    Dongzhiyuan is a typical example of large-scale comprehensive treatment. Dongzhiyuan is a large loess plateau with a broken surface and severe erosion. In the winter of 1959, 50,000 people were mobilized to carry out water conservancy and soil and water conservation movements centered on drought prevention and resistance. On the plateau surface, we focused on three waters, universally drilled multiple string wells, built plateau reservoirs, and realized gardenization. In the gully, dams and ponds were built in sections, and water was lifted at multiple levels. On the edge of the plateau, we built a flower and fruit wall combining forest belts, field ridges, and grass belts. On the gully slopes, we built terraces, cultivated flower and fruit mountains, and pasture slopes. In just over three months, we drilled 150,000 wells, built more than 5,000 plateau reservoirs, more than 1,500 kilometers of flower and fruit walls, and more than 3,000 kilometers of plateau grass belts, completing a treatment area of 1,516 square kilometers. In the past, there was not a single mu of irrigated land here. Now, the underground water alone has irrigated 480,000 mu, breaking the so-called "plateau water shortage" and opening up a broad road for plateau water conservancy.

    The new situation of high-speed development of soil and water conservation in Gansu once again demonstrates the great vitality of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The Party's General Line of Socialist Construction has greatly encouraged the confidence and enthusiasm of the people of Gansu to overcome drought and pointed out the direction for carrying out soil and water conservation in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The policy of walking on two legs has opened up a broad space for the masses, better implementing the principle of adapting to local conditions and fully tapping the potential strength of all parties. In particular, the policy of "large-scale treatment and construction of main and tributary reservoirs at the same time" fully reflects the interdependence of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, and is the concretization and new development of walking on two legs in soil and water conservation work. Implementing this policy can integrate water conservancy and soil and water conservation into a whole, complementing each other and leaping forward together. The treatment of the Zuli River and Dongzhiyuan is proof. Under the guidance of this policy, we are comprehensively carrying out the comprehensive treatment of "Two Rivers and Ten Rivers". In addition, soil and water conservation institutions were established, and permanent infrastructure construction teams were established. Combined with large-scale treatment, the province plans to build a large number of reservoirs. After the completion of these projects, they can play a multi-faceted effect of flood control, water storage, irrigation, and power generation, control soil erosion, accelerate the realization of water conservancy, mechanization, electrification, and landscaping, and promote the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline fisheries, and local industry, so that the face of the entire basin will undergo fundamental changes.

    The People's Commune is the foundation for the high-speed development of soil and water conservation. In the past, soil and water conservation in Gansu was the treatment of one gully and one slope. After the people's commune was established, with the great changes in production relations and the great development of productive forces, soil and water conservation also opened up a new situation of large-scale treatment by mountain systems and river basins. With the people's commune, it is possible to carry out large-scale comprehensive planning. There is also an organizational guarantee for the realization of the plan. The famous Dengjiabao in Wushan County had only treated an area of ​​10 square kilometers in eight years. Last winter and this spring, the treatment area suddenly expanded to 240 square kilometers (of which 80 square kilometers reached the high standards of "Dengjiabao"). With the people's commune, it is possible to better mobilize labor, organize large battles and large-scale cooperation, and form a massive mass movement. Before the communization, the labor force mobilized for a project was generally only a few hundred people, and the scope of cooperation was only a few agricultural cooperatives. Now, a battle often involves tens of thousands of people, and several communes or even several counties cooperate on a large scale. In the Qingshui River basin, last winter, nine people's communes in Qingshui and Qin'an counties organized large-scale cooperation, mobilizing 90,000 people, and battling for one month, completing 260,000 gully dams, 80,000 ponds, building 300,000 mu of terraced fields, planting more than 200,000 mu of forests, planting 100,000 mu of grass, and the treatment area reached 420 square kilometers. Such scale and speed were unimaginable before the communization. With the people's commune, it is possible to vigorously carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution, combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and rapidly improve labor efficiency and project quality. Now, many construction sites are running factories, innovating tools, realizing soil mechanization, reducing heavy physical labor, saving labor, and doubling work efficiency. At the same time, advanced experience such as directional blasting, multi-well string wells, "Wan Shui Gui Tian", and "Yi Chuan Ling" water storage, which connects mountain reservoirs, ponds, dams, cellars, and canals, is widely promoted, and new technologies such as airplane seeding are being used. In the past, it generally took 30 to 40 workdays to build one mu of horizontal terraces, but now it only takes about 15 workdays, and the quality is better. In the past, it took 4,000 to 6,000 workdays to treat one square kilometer of Huajialing, but now it has been reduced to about 1,500 workdays. It is foreseeable that with the consolidation and development of the people's commune, soil and water conservation will definitely achieve better and more comprehensive sustained leaps forward.

    The high-speed development of soil and water conservation last winter and this spring is precisely because under the leadership of the Party, the anti-Rightist movement and the great effort to boost morale have been carried out, and ideological revolution has greatly improved the political awareness of the broad masses, making large-scale soil and water conservation a conscious, pleasant, and creative labor for the masses. Our Gansu is poorer and whiter, the difference is large, and the task of transforming nature is arduous. Soil and water conservation is at the forefront of fighting against nature. On this front, the struggle between the two roads and the two lines is quite prominent. Only by resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and carrying out continuous struggles against Right-leaning conservative thinking and the habit of following the old ways can we liberate the thinking of the broad masses, promote the communist style of daring to think and dare to do, and overcome difficulties and constantly achieve victories in conquering nature. It can be seen that only continuous revolution in thought can lead to continuous leaps forward in work. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of the Party and holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to continuously revolutionize ideology is the fundamental guarantee for the sustained leap forward in soil and water conservation.

    Although Gansu's soil and water conservation work has achieved great achievements, in order to adapt to the fundamental control of the Yellow River, change the arid face as soon as possible, and meet the requirements of high-speed development of agriculture, more and greater efforts are still needed. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line of Socialist Construction, as long as we continue to implement the simultaneous implementation of large-scale treatment and construction of main and tributary reservoirs, make full use of the experience of the past two years, rely on the people's commune, and vigorously carry out mass movements, we will definitely be able to build Gansu as beautiful as other parts of the motherland in a short period of time, so that our generation, and even our descendants, can live a life of increasing happiness and well-being.

专栏：

    甘肃水土保持的新阶段
    邓宝珊代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。现在，我讲一讲甘肃的水土保持工作。
    甘肃的水土保持，在过去几年的工作基础上，经过两年来的大跃进，已经从一沟一坡的治理，发展到按流域，按山系联社、联县大面积综合治理的新阶段。这个阶段的特点，是组织大面积、大兵团、大协作的群众运动，按照高工效、高速度、高标准、高质量的要求，进行集中治理、全面治理、综合治理、突击治理、连续治理。去冬今春，二百九十万群众大搞水利、水土保持运动，短短几个月，新治理面积就达到三万平方公里，相当于过去十年总成绩的三分之一以上；巩固提高面积两万多平方公里，超过了过去十年的总成绩。经过这个战役全省治理的面积增加到十一万平方公里，占水土流失总面积的65％；黄河流域十二万六千平方公里的水土流失面积，已经有八万九千平方公里得到了治理，其中效果显著的有四万平方公里。流入黄河的泥沙量约可减少一亿多吨。水土保持的大跃进，大大地加快了改变甘肃干旱面貌的进程，促进了农业的大发展，在今年的抗旱生产中起了很大作用。同时，对于根治黄河也贡献了更多的力量。
    大规模的水土保持群众运动，创造了不少按流域、按山系大面积治理的典型。这里，我简单地介绍华家岭、祖厉河、董志塬三个工程。
    华家岭是一个按山系大面积集中治理的典型。这个地方从1958年开始，组织了四个县的大协作，调动了三万多群众，大战四十天，1959年又继续进行全面治理和巩固提高。治理的办法，是在荒山荒坡上修方块梯田和反坡梯田，植树造林，种植牧草；在坡地修梯田；在山腰、路旁修建涝池，蓄水灌溉；沟壑修川台地和库塘。这样治理效果很好，1959年7月胜利地抗御了一次一百五十毫米的暴雨，90％以上的工程屹立无恙。坡地梯田获得了大面积丰收。现在有八百四十一平方公里已经得到全面治理。山地变成了梯田，沟壑变成了川台，满山是新植的树木和草带。山顶上还修了不少公园。华家岭群众这样歌颂：“水土保持好处多，跃进花结胜利果，青山绿水庄稼好，日子越过越快活。”
    祖厉河是一个按流域大面积集中治理的典型。这个流域面积很大，水土流失十分严重，是甘肃最干旱的地区。在几年来治理的基础上，经过全面规划，1959年冬季组织十二万人大搞水利和水土保持运动，一次治理三千平方公里。治理的方法，是全面治沟、治坡、植树种草，引洪漫地和干支流修大中小水库相结合。目前已修梯田一百多万亩，造林种草一百五十万亩，完成小型库塘五千六百多处，中型水库七座，治理毛支沟一千九百多条。新修水地十五万亩，整修三十二万亩。不少地方，已经是梯田连片，谷坊成串，塘窖成网，库渠相连，坡沟绿化，既能拦蓄洪水，又能灌溉耕地，给全流域展示了一幅美丽的前景。
    董志塬是大面积综合治理的典型。董志塬是一块大的黄土高原，塬面破碎，冲刷严重。1959年冬季，动员了五万群众，开展以防旱抗旱为中心的水利、水土保持运动。在塬面上，大抓三水，普遍打多眼串井，修建高原水库，实现园田化；沟内节节筑坝修塘，多级提水；在塬边营造林带、地埂、草带相结合的花果围墙；在沟坡修隔坡梯田，培植花果山、牧草坡，短短三个多月就打井十五万眼、修高原水库五千多座、花果围墙一千五百多公里，塬面草带三千多公里，完成治理面积一千五百一十六平方公里。过去这里没有一亩水地，现在单是利用地下水就已经灌溉四十八万亩，打破了所谓“高原缺水”的说法，为高原水利化开辟了广阔的道路。
    甘肃水土保持工作高速度发展的新形势，再一次显示了总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三大法宝的伟大生命力。党的社会主义建设总路线大大地鼓舞了甘肃人民战胜干旱的信心和干劲，为多快好省地进行水土保持指明了方向，两条腿走路的方针又为群众开辟了广阔的用武之地，更好地贯彻因地制宜的原则，充分发掘各方面的潜在力量。特别是“大面积治理与修建干支流水库同时并举”的方针，充分地反映了水利和水土保持相互依存的关系，是两条腿走路在水土保持工作上的具体化和新发展。贯彻这个方针，就能使水利和水土保持结成一个整体，相辅相成，共同跃进。祖厉河、董志塬的治理就是证明。在这个方针指导下，我们全面开展“二江、十河”的综合治理。并且成立了水土保持机构，建立了常年基建队。结合大面积治理，全省计划修建大量水库。这些工程完成以后，可以发挥防洪、蓄水、灌溉、发电等多方面效益，控制水土流失，加速实现水利化、机械化、电气化和园林化，促进农林牧副渔和地方工业的发展，使全流域的面貌发生根本变化。
    人民公社是水土保持高速度发展的基础。甘肃以往的水土保持，都是一沟一坡的治理，而人民公社化以后，随着生产关系的大改变，生产力的大发展，水土保持也就开创了按山系、按流域大面积治理的新局面。有了人民公社，就可以进行大面积的全面规划。也有了实现规划的组织保证。著名的武山县邓家堡，八年治理面积不过十平方公里，去冬今春治理面积一下子就扩大到二百四十平方公里（其中达到“邓家堡”那样高标准的有八十平方公里）。有了人民公社，就能更好地动员劳动力，组织大战役、大协作，形成声势浩大的群众运动。在公社化之前，一个工程动员的劳动力一般不过几百人，协作范围不过几个农业社；现在，一个战役往往成千成万人上阵，几个公社甚至几个县大协作。在清水河流域，去年冬季，清水、秦安两县的九个人民公社组织大协作，动员九万群众，大战一个月，完成谷坊二十六万道，涝池八万个，兴修梯田三十万亩，造林二十多万亩，种草十万亩，治理面积达到四百二十平方公里。像这样的规模和速度，在公社化以前，是不可想像的。有了人民公社，就能大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命，把大干、实干和巧干结合起来，迅速地提高劳动效率和工程质量。现在，许多工地都大办工厂，革新工具，实现土机械化，减轻了笨重体力劳动，节省了劳动力，工效成倍提高。同时，普遍推广定向爆破、多眼串井、万水归田、山地库塘坝窖渠相连的“一串铃”蓄水等先进经验，开始利用飞机播种等新技术。过去修一亩水平梯田，一般需要三、四十个工日，现在只要十五个工日左右，而且质量更好。华家岭过去治理一个平方公里，就要四千到六千个工日，现在减少到一千五百个工日左右，可以预料，随着人民公社的巩固和发展，水土保持工作一定会获得更好更全面的持续跃进。
    去冬今春水土保持工作能够获得这样大面积、高速度的发展正是由于在党的领导下，大反右倾、大鼓干劲，进行思想革命，大大地提高了广大群众的政治觉悟，使大搞水土保持成为群众自觉的愉快的创造性的劳动。我们甘肃更穷更白，差别性大，改造自然的任务艰巨，水土保持又处在向自然作斗争的前列，在这个战线上，两条道路和两条路线的斗争是相当突出的。只有坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，同右倾保守思想和因循守旧的习惯势力进行不断的斗争，才能解放广大群众的思想，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，也才能战胜困难，不断地取得征服自然的胜利。可见只有思想上的不断革命，才能获得工作上的不断跃进。因此，加强党的领导，高举毛泽东思想的红旗不断地革思想的命，是水土保持工作持续跃进的根本保证。
    甘肃的水土保持工作虽然取得了巨大的成就，但是要适应根治黄河，尽快改变干旱面貌，和高速度发展农业的要求，还需要作更多更大的努力。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，只要继续实行大面积治理与修建干支流水库同时并举，充分利用两年来的经验，依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动，我们就一定能够在不长的时间内，把甘肃建设得和祖国各地一样的美丽，让我们这一代，以至子孙万代，过着日益幸福美好的生活。
