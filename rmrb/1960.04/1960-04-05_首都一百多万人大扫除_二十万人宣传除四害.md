Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Yesterday in Beijing, over 200,000 people used their holiday to promote the elimination of the "Four Pests" and hygiene awareness on streets and in alleyways. More than one million workers, students, cadres, and residents, armed with cleaning tools, engaged in a massive cleanup of various public places.

From early morning, loudspeakers throughout the city were broadcasting, promoting the idea of "taking pride in hygiene and being ashamed of unsanitary conditions." The China Youth Art Theater and Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and the Beijing People's Art Theater and Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, jointly formed propaganda teams to promote hygiene on the streets. Propaganda vehicles from each district were dispatched. Many Young Pioneers, holding red flags and megaphones, advised pedestrians not to spit on the ground, and they entered courtyards, singing hygiene songs, and helped residents clean. Movie theaters throughout the city have been showing hygiene-related slides in recent days. Professors and medical personnel from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Anding Hospital, Children's Hospital, and other institutions participated in street promotion activities. Some medical personnel went deep into street canteens and nurseries, conducting inspections, promoting hygiene, and providing guidance.

The workers, students, cadres, and residents who participated in the cleanup worked very enthusiastically. The shock team cleaning outside Dongzhimen, after dredging stagnant water and filling potholes, built flower beds on both sides of the sidewalks. The cadres cleaning in front of the Museum of Chinese History also planted Chinese junipers and white poplars. In conjunction with this cleanup, various units reorganized their sanitation organizations and established sanitation systems. The vast majority of units established patriotic health covenants to ensure the regular implementation of sanitation work.

    首都一百多万人大扫除
    二十万人宣传除四害
    新华社4日讯　北京昨天有二十多万人利用假日，在大街小巷宣传除四害讲卫生。有一百多万工人、学生、干部和居民带着清扫工具，在各个公共场所大扫除。
    清晨起，全市各处的扩音器全部开放，宣传“以讲卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”。中国青年艺术剧院和协和医院，北京人民艺术剧院和北京市妇产科医院，都联合组成宣传队，在街头宣传。各区的广播宣传车全部出动。许多少先队员手执红旗和喇叭筒，在路边劝告行人别随地吐痰，他们走进一家家的院子，唱着讲卫生的歌曲，还帮助居民打扫。全市影剧院这几天也加映了讲卫生的幻灯片。中国医学科学院、北京协和医院、同仁医院、安定医院、儿童医院等单位的教授、医务人员等，都到街头参加宣传活动。还有一部分医务人员深入街道食堂、托儿所，边检查、边宣传、边指导。
    参加打扫的工人、学生、干部、居民干得很起劲。在东直门外打扫的突击队，在疏通积水、填平坑洼以后，又在行人道的两旁筑起了花台。在中国历史博物馆门前打扫的机关干部，也种下了桧松和白杨。各单位结合这次扫除，重新整顿了卫生组织，建立了卫生制度。绝大多数单位订立了爱国卫生公约，保证卫生工作经常化。
