Famous Region Spreads Throughout the Land
Committee Member Zheng Xiaocang Discusses Changes in Hangzhou

Chairman, fellow committee members:

This time, attending the conference in Beijing and listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan” and Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft” has further strengthened my confidence that this year and thereafter, we will inevitably and certainly be able to sustain the Great Leap Forward. Witnessing the even more magnificent scenery about to unfold in New China, and recognizing that the direction pointed to by the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is also the place where victory will arrive, I am filled with joy and excitement and express my heartfelt support. I also listened to the work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong over the past year and his opinions on future work, which pointed out a very clear direction, and I fully agree.

Hangzhou University
The Hangzhou University where I work is a new product of the Great Leap Forward. This year, I'm wearing a "Hangzhou University" badge, and many committee members are seeing its name for the first time, expressing surprise. Therefore, I would like to say a few words about Hangzhou University.

Zhejiang University, which was transformed from the Qiushi Academy in 1928, had seven departments after the War of Resistance against Japan, but at that time, the number of students probably did not exceed a thousand. In 1952, Zhejiang Province adjusted the departments of higher education institutions, and Zhejiang University specialized in engineering, and now has eight or nine thousand students. From 1956, under the call of "marching towards science," Zhejiang had the motivation to establish a comprehensive university, and at that time, it seemed that "Hangzhou University" had already been proposed. In 1958, in the midst of the Great Leap Forward, it was indeed realized on the basis of the original Zhejiang Normal College. There are now five thousand students. There are now eleven departments. In addition to Chinese Language and Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, History, Geography, Politics, Education, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, there is also a Journalism Department. The Philosophy Department and Economics Department will be added next semester, among which there are relatively more social science departments. In addition to Zhejiang University and Hangzhou University, Hangzhou is also about to expand the Agricultural College into an Agricultural Science University and expand the Medical College into a Medical Science University. It can be seen that Zhejiang Province's cultural and educational undertakings, like those of other provinces, will greatly develop.

I was originally at Zhejiang Normal College, and after the merger, I was in the Education Department of Hangzhou University. My professional work is the history of education, mainly the history of European education. Because I am nearly seventy years old, the leadership has taken care of me, and since 1958, I have no longer taught classes and have specialized in scientific research. I have done ten kinds of work in the past four or five years. In 1957, when Czechoslovakia held the 300th anniversary international memorial conference for the great educator Comenius, I compiled a script about his life and sent it to participate through the organization to express my respect. I have also written "Yan Yuan (Xizhai)'s Educational Thought," "Research on the Use of Illustrations in Chinese Educational Books," and "A Summary of the History of Zhejiang Second-Level Normal School and Zhejiang First Normal School." To encourage me, the Party branch and colleagues believe that I have quite some energy and slightly some achievements in this area, but it is really very small. Compared with the detailed and heavy work done by our Education Department on rewriting teaching materials and educational internships, I am really ashamed. Compared with the research on freshwater fish egg-laying by the Biology Department of Hangzhou University and the work done by the Geography Department, which has accepted the commission of the Provincial People's Committee, which can benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, I feel even more ashamed! In addition to regular labor, the teachers and students of Hangzhou University often go to the countryside and factories, gradually approaching and gradually integrating with the worker-peasant comrades. Since studying, giving encouragement, and opposing rightist tendencies last autumn, their thinking has greatly improved, followed by comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and technical revolution upsurges, which are very vigorous. I have listed some of these facts to see a glimpse of the Great Leap Forward in a school in Hangzhou.

New Scenery of West Lake
Many committee members said to me, "I think Hangzhou is even more beautiful now." Indeed, Hangzhou has changed from a consumer city to a city with both heavy industry—including steel, machinery, electrical machinery, oxygen production, sulfuric acid—and many light industries. Significant achievements have been made in eliminating the four pests, especially in Xiaoying Lane, which Chairman Mao personally visited, giving people unlimited encouragement. Street canteens have also been established in many places. As for West Lake, also thanks to the leadership of the Party, it has indeed been renovated to be even more beautiful. Last year, more than a dozen painters from Hangzhou jointly painted three large paintings of "New Scenery of West Lake." At that time, I wrote six seven-character quatrains to express my joy. I will now record them here so that the committee members can also imagine the new appearance of West Lake:

1.  Delineating the new jade face of West Lake,
    Ten years of dredging, ten thousand people cheered.
    After the natural beauty is carefully adorned,
    Such grace is unparalleled in history.

2.  Once the walls that block the view are removed,
    Jade buildings and vermilion pavilions reflect on the lake.
    The white embankment is soft with grass, and the flowers are dazzling,
    Joy overflows the painting.

3.  Outside the Peony Pavilion, the flowers are drunk,
    The peaks before the Emerald Rain Pavilion are clear again.
    People and游鱼 are equally happy,
    The dancing姿 looks like singing.

4.  Opening paths, connecting mountains, changing to a flat road,
    The planted trees are already lush.
    Ten years of dredging are still in place,
    A hundred miles around is a picture of public happiness.

5.  The scenery on the lake is like a painting,
    The best scenery on the lake is difficult to imitate.
    The poetic heart quietly appreciates the beauty of the spring mountains,
    The wonderful brush miraculously conveys the abundance of the autumn water.

6.  The tea fields of Meizhu Island sing softly,
    The willows under Su Causeway dance gracefully.
    Famous region, famous painting spreads all over the world,
    Pine and cypress are evergreen for hundreds of millions of years!

### 名区传天下  郑晓沧委员谈杭州的变化

    名区传天下
    郑晓沧委员谈杭州的变化主席、各位委员：
    这次来京参加会议，听到了李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，益发坚强了我对本年和以后必然和必能持续跃进的信心；眼见新中国即将展开的更瑰丽的美景，认识到毛泽东思想旗帜所指向也即胜利所到达之处。我不胜欢欣鼓舞，表示衷心拥护。我也听到了政协陈叔通副主席第三届全国委员会常务委员会一年来的工作报告和对今后工作的意见，指出了十分明确的方向，我表示完全同意。	杭州大学
    我所在的杭州大学是大跃进声中的新产儿。今年我挂上一个“杭州大学”的徽章，不少委员还是初次看见它的名字，见了表示惊异，因此我愿对杭州大学略说几句。
    在1928年由求是学院改成的浙江大学，在抗日战争复员后有七个院，但当时学生恐不超过千人。1952年浙江省高等学校院系调整，浙江大学专办工科，现在学生已有八九千人。1956年起在“向科学进军”的号召下浙江有建立一个综合大学的动机，当时好像已有“杭州大学”的提出。1958年在大跃进声中果然在浙江师范学院原有的基础上实现了。学生现在已有五千人。现在有十一个系，除中国语文、外国语文、历史、地理、政治、教育、数学、物理、化学、生物外，尚设有新闻系，下学期将添设哲学系与经济系，其中社会科学的学系比较多。又杭州除浙江大学杭州大学外还即将扩大农学院为农科大学，扩大医学院为医科大学。可以见到浙江省文教事业和他省一样将大大发展。
    我原在浙江师范学院，合并后即在杭州大学的教育系。我的业务工作是教育史，主要是欧洲教育史。因为年近七十，领导上照顾我，从1958年起已不再任课，专搞科研一类工作。这四五年来做过十种。1957年捷克斯洛伐克为伟大教育家夸美纽斯举行三百周年国际纪念大会时，我曾把他的一生编过一个剧本，通过组织，寄往参加，以表敬意。也曾写过“颜元（习斋）的教育思想”，“中国教育用书附用图绘的研究”，“浙江两级师范和浙江一师校史志要”等。党总支和同事们为鼓励我起见，认为我在这一方面颇有些干劲也略有些成就，但实在是渺小得很，比起我们教育系里对重编教材和教育实习上所做的细致繁重的工作，实有愧色；比起杭大生物系淡水鱼催卵研究，以及地理系接受了本省人民委员会的委托做了不少可以有益于国计民生的工作，我更感到惶愧！杭大师生除平时劳动外，也常常下乡下厂，和工农同志逐渐接近，逐渐融合。自去秋学习鼓干劲反右倾以后，思想大大提高，继以比学赶帮，和技术革命高潮，十分蓬勃。我列举这一些事实，得见杭州一个学校跃进的一斑。	西湖新景
    不少委员对我说，“想来杭州更美丽了。”真的，杭州已从一个消费城市变为一个兼有重工业——包括钢铁、机械、电机、制氧、硫酸和很多轻工业的城市了。除四害成绩显著，尤以小营巷为最，毛主席曾亲自去看过，给人们以无限的鼓励。街道食堂也多办起来了。至于西湖，一样由于党的领导，确也整治得更美好了。去年杭州十余画家合绘了“西湖新景”大幅三帧，我当时曾有七绝六首表示欣喜，兹录于下，使委员们也可想像到西子湖的新面貌：
    一、钩出西湖新玉貌，十年梳理万人呼。
        天然美质严妆后，如此风姿旷代无。
    二、障眼垣墙一旦除，琼楼朱阁映平湖。
        白堤草软花迷眼，欢意蓬蓬溢画图。
    三、牡丹亭外花如醉，翠雨厅前嶂又清。
        人与游鱼同极乐，舞姿活似有歌声。
    四、辟径连山变坦途，种来嘉木已扶疏。
        十年浚治规模在，百里回环众乐图。
    五、湖上风光似画图，湖山胜处画难摹。
        诗心静挹春山美，妙笔神传秋水腴。
    六、梅隝茶畦歌宛转，苏堤柳下舞蹁跹。
        名区名画传天下，松柏长青亿万年！
