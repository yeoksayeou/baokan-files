Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report. I pledge to implement them in my work.

In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, China's mining science and technology have achieved unprecedented development. Under the leadership of the Party and illuminated by the thought of Mao Zedong, the broad masses of mine workers and mining science and technology personnel have formed their own technical line in practice, enabling China's mining science and technology to embark on a path of independent development. China's mining science and technology will reach the world's peak with a brand-new face and unique style.

High-Speed Mining Has Immeasurable Economic and Technical Significance

The great achievement of China's mining science and technology is concentrated in a major technological revolution that has been realized in China's mines since the Great Leap Forward, especially since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee—high-speed mining. The level we have reached in increasing mining speed or increasing output per unit area has far exceeded the world's most advanced level. In the past three months, some of our mines have successively created three amazing high-yield records, the most recent of which reached 648 tons per square meter per month. This is the great creation of the Chinese working people. The emergence of this miracle has immeasurable economic and technical significance.

High-speed mining means an increase in output per unit area, which not only achieves centralized operations, improves equipment utilization, and increases labor productivity, but more importantly, it can increase mine production capacity several times, save a lot of construction funds, and buy time to ensure the high-speed development of the metallurgical industry.

According to an estimate from a mine in Hunan, after realizing rapid mining, the mine's annual task can be completed in four months, the cost can be reduced by 40%, and the number of personnel can be reduced by about one-third. It is not difficult to imagine how significant this technological revolution is to our socialist cause.

The achievements of rapid mining have broken many outdated views on mining technology and opened up new horizons for mining science and technology. Because we can complete the recovery process at a speed several times to ten times faster than in the past, many complex problems in mining technology are simplified or easier to solve. For example, because we have mastered high speed, we can use simple and efficient methods to recover ore pillars and carry out recovery without support under conditions where the surrounding rock is not stable enough. Under the conditions of rapid mining, the nature of many mining technology problems has also changed, especially mine pressure, ventilation, transportation, and other issues.

High-speed mining is a new thing in mining technology. Although some aspects of it need to be further improved and our experience is still insufficient, and it has also brought many new technical problems, it is certain that this is in line with the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical." It is also the most advanced technological achievement in technology and a major contribution to world science and technology. The primary task of our mining science and technology personnel at present is to provide technical support for high-speed mining, so that roadway excavation, rock drilling, blasting, transportation, and ventilation can meet the new requirements, especially roadway excavation and underground transportation must be adapted to the mining speed. Taking high-speed mining as the key, our mining science and technology will be able to achieve high-speed and comprehensive development and reach the world's peak. High-speed mining is the victory of the general line and the result of putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements.

This major victory on the mining science and technology front is the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the result of implementing putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements in scientific and technological work, and, in short, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

High-speed mining is the product of unifying politics and technology in accordance with the spirit of the general line. There were disputes among technicians about whether mining work could be high-speed and should be high-speed. Some people believe that mining work has complex natural conditions and complex technological processes, so it cannot be high-speed, based on some outdated technical views. Some people regard the speed already achieved in foreign countries as insurmountable. Still others believe that high-speed mining will inevitably reduce labor productivity. In foreign countries, there are indeed some experts and scholars who oppose high-speed mining based on the so-called theory of ground pressure redistribution. In fact, the focus of the dispute is whether technology should be separated from politics or should obey politics and be unified with politics. Facts have proved that high speed is not only required by the general line, but also required by mining technology itself. As a result of implementing rapid mining, labor productivity has not decreased, but has greatly increased; the problem of ground pressure has not been complicated, but has been simplified. This major achievement in mining science and technology also powerfully demonstrates that we must further eliminate metaphysics, mechanical materialism, and all idealistic viewpoints in scientific and technological work, and establish a dialectical materialist viewpoint. The so-called scientific and technological theories of bourgeois scholars are often filled with mechanical materialist viewpoints. They always isolate some technical problems, only see their surface phenomena, and do not see the internal connections between them, the subjective initiative of people, especially the role of the subjective initiative of conscious and organized people under the leadership of the Party.

The achievement of high-speed mining once again proves that scientific and technological work must vigorously launch mass movements, and professional scientific research must be combined with mass scientific and technological activities. In 1958, under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, we vigorously launched mass movements and solved the dust prevention problem in the entire mine in just over a month. Then, in less than a year, the dust prevention work in major metal mines across the country reached the requirements of national health standards. Since then, this technology of mine ventilation and dust prevention in China has achieved unprecedented development, basically completing the tasks in this area stipulated in the Twelve-Year Science Plan. High-speed mining is also the result of vigorously launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party. Without a vigorous mass movement, it would be impossible to concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses of mine workers and scientific and technological personnel, to fully exert their dynamic role, and to break through all outdated technical views and heavy ideological obstacles.

Continuous Revolution and Continuous Liberation of the Mind are Needed to Achieve the Major Technological Revolution of High-Speed Mining

Chairman Mao once taught us: "The productive activity of human society develops step by step from a lower to a higher level, therefore, people's understanding, whether of nature or of society, also develops step by step from a lower to a higher level." Since the task of natural science is to understand nature and then transform it, the development process of science and technology must be a process of continuous revolution, continuous breaking, continuous establishment, continuous liberation of the mind, and continuous breaking of superstitions. The development process of high-speed mining powerfully illustrates this point. As far as we know, the highest record abroad is about 110 tons per square meter per month, and generally about 20 tons, but we have broken the highest record time and time again. Now our heroic mine workers are marching towards 1,500 tons per square meter per month. If we do not follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously revolutionize, continuously break superstitions, and continuously liberate our minds, such a major technological revolution would not have occurred.

Chairman Mao said: "With the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, an upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Chairman Mao's scientific prediction has been proven by vivid facts. Our science and technology are now incomparably prosperous and flourishing. The mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is unprecedented in its scale. Science and technology are in a very good situation. The experience of the past few years has proven that under China's conditions, especially under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, science and technology can develop forward at high speed and with high quality. We have already achieved great victories. As long as we better study Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the general line and the Great Leap Forward in the field of science and technology, continue to consolidate and strengthen the leadership of the Party, and vigorously launch mass movements, we will move from one victory to even greater victories.

Please correct me if the above opinions are inappropriate.

    一项重大技术革命——高速度采矿
    简根贤委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告以及陈叔通副主席的工作报告，并保证在自己的工作中贯彻执行。
    几年来，特别是大跃进以来，我国采矿科学技术获得了空前的发展，广大矿山职工和采矿科学技术人员，在党的领导下，在毛主席思想的光辉照耀下，在实践中形成了自己的技术路线，从而使我国的采矿科学技术走上了独立发展的道路。我国采矿科学技术将以崭新的面貌，独特的风格，跃居世界高峰。
    高速度采矿在经济上和技术上有着不可估量的重大意义
    集中地代表着我国采矿科学技术伟大成就的是大跃进以来，特别是八届八中全会以来，在我国矿山实现的一项重大技术革命——高速度采矿。我们在提高采矿速度，或者提高单位面积产量方面所达到的水平，已经远远地超过了世界最先进水平。最近三个月我们的一些矿山接连创造了三次惊人的高产纪录，最近的一次达到每平方米月产六百四十八吨。这是我国劳动人民的伟大创造。这一奇迹的出现，在经济上和技术上都有不可估量的重大意义。
    高速度采矿意味着单位面积产量的提高，其结果是不仅实现了集中作业，提高了设备利用率，提高了劳动生产率，而更重要的是矿山生产能力可以提高几倍，节约大量的建设资金，争取了时间，以保证冶金工业的高速度发展。
    根据湖南一个矿的估计，实现快速采矿之后，这个矿山的全年任务可以在四个月内完成，成本可以降低40％，人员可减少三分之一左右。不难想像，这一技术革命成果对我们的社会主义事业有着多么重大的意义。
    快速采矿的成就打破了采矿技术上的许多陈腐观点，为采矿科学技术开辟了新的天地。由于我们能够以比过去快几倍至十几倍的速度完成回采过程，许多采矿技术中的复杂问题都简化，或者更容易得到解决了。例如，由于我们掌握了高速度，我们就有可能利用简单而效率高的方法回采矿柱，在围岩不够稳固的条件下可以不用支护，进行回采。在快速采矿的条件下，许多采矿技术问题的性质也起了变化，特别是矿山压力，通风，运输等问题。
    高速度采矿是采矿技术中的新鲜事物，虽然在它的某些方面还需要继续改进、提高，我们的经验也还不足，而且它也带来了许多技术上的新问题，但是，可以肯定，这是符合多快好省的，在技术上也是最先进的一项技术成就，是对世界科学技术的重大贡献。我们采矿科学技术人员当前的首要任务是围绕着高速度采矿，在技术上加以配套，使巷道掘进、凿岩、爆破、运输、通风都能满足新的要求，特别是巷道掘进和坑内运输必须与采矿速度相适应。以高速度采矿为纲，我们的采矿科学技术将能得到高速度的，全面的发展，而跃居世界高峰。高速度采矿是总路线的胜利，是政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的结果
    采矿科学技术战线上的这一重大胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是在科学技术工作中实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果，总之，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    高速度采矿是根据总路线的精神，把政治和技术统一起来的产物。对于采矿工作能不能高速度、应不应该高速度这样一个问题，在技术人员中不是没有争论的。有些人根据一些陈旧的技术观点，认为采矿工作自然条件复杂，工艺过程复杂，不能高速度；有些人把国外已经达到的速度认为是不可逾越的；更有些人认为高速度采矿必然降低劳动生产率。在国外，确实也有一些专家学者根据所谓地压重分布的理论，反对高速度采矿的。其实分歧的焦点是技术应该脱离政治，还是应该服从政治而和政治统一起来的问题。事实证明，高速度不但是总路线所要求的，同时也是采矿技术本身所要求的。实行快速采矿的结果，劳动生产率不是降低了，而是大大地提高了；地压问题不是复杂化了，而是简单化了。采矿科学技术上的这一重大成就还有力地说明了，在科学技术工作中必须进一步清除形而上学，机械唯物论和一切唯心主义观点，确立辩证唯物主义观点。资产阶级学者们的所谓科学技术理论，往往是充满了机械唯物论的观点的。他们总是把一些技术问题孤立起来，只看到它们的表面现象，看不到它们之间的内在联系，看不到人的主观能动性，特别是看不到在党领导下的有觉悟有组织的人们的主观能动性的作用。
    高速度采矿的成就又一次证明了，科学技术工作必须大搞群众运动，专职的科学研究必须和群众性的科学技术活动结合起来。1958年我们在矿山党委的领导下，大搞群众运动，只一个多月便解决了全矿的防尘问题，接着在不到一年的时间内，全国主要金属矿的防尘工作都达到了国家卫生标准的要求，从此我国矿井通风防尘这一门技术获得了空前发展，基本上完成了十二年科学规划所规定的这一方面的任务。高速度采矿，同样是在党的领导下大搞群众运动的结果。没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，是不可能集中广大矿山职工和科学技术人员的智慧，不可能充分发挥他们的能动作用，也不可能冲破一切陈腐的技术观点和重重的思想障碍的。
    不断革命，不断解放思想，才出现高速度采矿这一项重大技术革命
    毛主席曾经教导过我们：“人类社会的生产活动，是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，因此，人们的认识，不论对于自然界方面，对于社会方面，也都是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展。”自然科学的任务既然是认识自然进而改造自然，科学技术的发展过程必然是不断革命，不断地破，不断地立，不断解放思想，不断破除迷信的过程。高速度采矿的发展过程有力地说明了这一点。据我们所知，国外最高的纪录是每平方米月产一百一十吨左右，一般是二十吨左右，但是我们一次又一次地打破了最高纪录。现在我们英雄的矿山职工正向每平方米月产一千五百吨进军。如果不是遵循着毛主席的教导、不断革命、不断破除迷信、不断解放思想，这样的一项重大技术革命是不会出现的。
    毛主席说过：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”毛主席的这一科学预见已为活生生的事实证明了。我们的科学技术现在是无比的繁荣和昌盛，群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，声势之大前所未有，科学技术事业正处于大好形势之中。几年来的经验证明了，在我国的条件下，特别是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，科学技术是可以高速度高质量地向前发展的。我们已经取得了伟大的胜利，只要我们更好地学习毛泽东思想，在科学技术领域中，高举总路线、大跃进的红旗，继续巩固和加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，我们将从一个胜利走向更大的胜利。
    以上意见是否有当，请各位委员指正。
