	Ten Thousand Cadres from Jilin Converge on the Fields
	Recently, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requested the organization of 100,000 cadres from six levels—province, prefecture (city, autonomous prefecture), county, commune, management district, and production team—to converge on the fields and immediately launch a major inspection and comparison of spring plowing production to ensure the quality of this year's sowing.
	The Provincial Committee requires that this 100,000-strong inspection army not only be an inspection team but also a propaganda team; not only a work team but also a production team. At the same time, it is necessary to closely rely on the masses, focus on ideology, focus on policies, focus on production, focus on livelihood, and vigorously push spring plowing production to a new upsurge.

	Eight Thousand Cooks in Zhejiang Leave the Kitchen
	The culinary tool reform movement in rural public canteens in Zhejiang Province has achieved brilliant results. More than 80,000 cooks throughout the province have gone to the front line of production.
	According to incomplete statistics on March 28, 72% of the province's 137,000+ canteens had established "all-purpose stoves" or air-assisted combustion stoves and gas stoves, and 31% of the canteens had achieved semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, achieving "no need to carry water, no need to use knives for cutting vegetables, and cooking is all done with all-purpose stoves."

	Qinghai Wants Wild Plants to Bloom Everywhere
	Qinghai is extremely rich in wild plants. According to preliminary surveys, there are approximately 2,000 species in the province. These plants have high yields, wide uses, and great value, and are an inexhaustible treasure trove for developing diversified operations. Therefore, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee recently instructed all localities to strengthen the management and comprehensive utilization of wild plants, make overall plans, and develop them on a large scale with a focus.
	Currently, it is necessary to first protect the concentrated production areas of natural large-scale wild plants. For those plants suitable for scattered planting, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses and the staff and cadres of agencies, troops, schools, and organizations, and make full use of all available wasteland to combine "small spring plowing" with afforestation, soil and water conservation, and wasteland reclamation, so that domestic and wild plants bloom everywhere and bear fruit all over the land.

	Henan Sets Off a Spring Pig-Raising Upsurge
	Henan Province has set off a spring pig-raising upsurge with a larger scale and higher speed.
	Since March, all localities have mobilized the masses to vigorously grasp the breeding and reproduction of eligible sows. Now, 77.7% of the eligible sows in the province are pregnant. According to recent statistics, the number of pigs in stock throughout the province has increased by more than 10% compared to the end of 1959. More than 500 state-run farms and fattening farms have also been built throughout the province, and people's communes in various places have also established more than 200,000 collective pig farms. These state-run farms and collectively raised pigs of the people's communes account for more than 80% of the total number of pigs in the province.

	Carry Out the Pig Farm "Hundred Mothers, Ten Thousand Offspring" Movement
	The Changling Town People's Commune in Changling County, Jilin Province, summarized the experience of "one sow producing a hundred offspring a year" and launched a "one farm, hundred mothers, ten thousand offspring" piglet abundance movement. This year, by March 25, it had increased by 36% compared to the same period last year. The Changling County Party Committee believes that the "one farm, hundred mothers, ten thousand offspring" movement is a new development in the experience of rapidly developing the pig-raising industry, and the "hundred mothers, ten thousand offspring" movement has been launched in pig farms throughout the county.

    省委要求这支十万人的检查大军，不仅是检查团，也是宣传团；不仅是工作队，也是生产队。同时要紧紧依靠群众，抓思想、抓政策、抓生产、抓生活、把春耕生产有力地推向高潮。
    浙江八万炊事员走出厨房
    浙江省农村公共食堂的炊具改革运动取得了辉煌的成绩。全省已有八万多个炊事员走上了生产第一线。
    据3月28日的不完全统计，全省十三万七千多个食堂中，已有72％的食堂建立了万灵灶或空气助燃灶、煤气灶，已有31％的食堂实现了炊具半机械化，做到了“饮水不用挑，切菜不用刀，烧饭都用万灵灶”。
    青海要野生植物遍地开花
    青海野生植物极为丰富，据初步调查，全省约有二千余种。这些植物产量高，用途广，价值大，是发展多种经营取之不尽的宝库。因此，青海省委最近指示各地对野生植物加强管理和综合利用，全面规划，有重点地大量发展。
    当前，首先要管护好天然大片野生植物的集中产区。对于那些适于零星种植的植物，必须广泛发动群众和机关、部队、学校、团体的职工干部，充分利用一切可以利用的荒地，使“小春耕”与造林、水土保持以及开垦荒地结合起来，让家生、野生植物到处开花，遍地结果。
    河南掀起春季养猪高潮
