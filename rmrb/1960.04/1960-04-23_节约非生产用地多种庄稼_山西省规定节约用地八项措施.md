    Taiyuan, April 22nd (reporting from this newspaper) - A mass movement to investigate land, find measures, conserve land, and increase land utilization is being carried out vigorously throughout Shanxi Province. People's communes in mountainous areas are building water conservancy projects, silting up beaches, and implementing agroforestry in conjunction with soil and water conservation. Areas with fallow land cultivation habits have begun to innovate, changing fallow land for soil recuperation into crop rotation, actively expanding the planting area. Plain areas, in conjunction with the establishment of high-yield plots, are reducing the area occupied by roads and other construction in various ways. While fundamentally treating alkaline land, many communes are generally carrying out planting and utilization in the same year, adapting to local conditions. In addition to the communes making full use of all available small plots and strips of land such as field ridges, field embankments, village edges, house sides, and roadsides and canal sides, factories, mines, schools, government agencies, and basic construction units in various places are also trying to utilize vacant and temporarily vacant land to plant vegetables, oil crops, and food crops. According to recent statistics from the Jinbei, Jinzhong, and Jinnan special districts, a total of more than 5 million mu of planting area can be expanded by taking the above measures. Not only does the sparsely populated Jinbei region have great potential, with an average increase of nearly one mu of planting area per agricultural population, but the Jinnan cotton and wheat producing area located in the plains has also expanded its planting area by 2 million mu in the economical land use campaign.

    The various localities' investigation of land, finding of land, and utilization of vacant land, striving to expand the land utilization rate, have already shown a tremendous effect on production. Jinbei Special District launched a "Sunflower Planting Month" campaign in April. Due to the extensive use of vacant land and alkaline land, the planting area of oil crops such as sunflowers has expanded to 2.4 million mu, a significant increase compared with previous years. Qinyuan, Lingchuan, Pingshun and other counties in the Taihang Mountains widely used barren mountains and slopes to plant oil crops, resulting in many "Sunflower Mountains" and "Oil Crop Slopes". In the past, in the Jinnan Special District, a cotton and wheat producing area, it was difficult to ensure the implementation of planting plans for crops such as oil crops, feed, and vegetables due to competition for land with grain and cotton. This contradiction has begun to be resolved this year. Yincheng Commune in the suburbs of Changzhi City recently carried out a comprehensive plan from mountains to gullies, from near to far, and launched "Ten Utilizations": utilizing small plots of land, restoring fallow land, utilizing fish-scale pits, utilizing young tree forests, utilizing orchards, utilizing canal sides and roadsides, cutting off small roads, straightening riverbeds, utilizing flowerbeds, utilizing ridge backs and embankments, planting grain crops, planting vegetables, and planting oil crops. Preliminary calculations show that the planting of grain crops alone can increase production by 750,000 jin of grain, enough for the food ration of 2,000 commune members for a year. In addition, many areas have paid attention to using idle land for field facilities such as livestock pens, toilets, and fertilizer pits, saving a lot of good farmland.

    节约非生产用地多种庄稼
    山西省规定节约用地八项措施
    本报太原22日电　一个群众性的查地找措施，节约用地提高土地利用率的运动，在山西全省轰轰烈烈地开展起来。山区人民公社通过兴修水利，淤滩漫地，结合水土保持实行农林混作；有轮荒习惯的地区开始革新轮休养地为轮作养地，积极扩大播种面积。平川地区结合建立丰产方，从多方面缩小道路和其它建设占地面积。许多公社在根治碱化地的同时，普遍因地制宜进行当年种植利用。除各地公社充分利用地塄、地堰、村边、宅旁和道路、渠道两旁一切可利用的零星小块小条土地外，各地厂矿、学校、机关和基本建设单位，也都设法把空闲和暂时空闲的土地，加以利用，种植蔬菜、油料和粮食作物等。据晋北、晋中、晋南三个专区最近统计，采取以上办法，合计可扩大种植面积五百多万亩。不仅地广人稀的晋北地区潜力很大，平均每个农业人口增加种植面积近一亩，地处平川的晋南棉麦产区在节约用地运动中也使播种面积扩大了二百万亩。
    各地查地、找地利用空闲土地，千方百计扩大土地利用率，已在生产上显示了巨大作用。晋北专区在4月份开展了“种葵花月”活动，由于广泛利用空地、碱地，向日葵等油料作物的种植面积扩大到二百四十万亩，比往年有了显著增加。太行山区沁源、陵川、平顺等县广泛利用荒山荒坡种植油料，出现了许多“葵花山”、“油料坡”。棉麦产区晋南专区过去由于油料、饲料和蔬菜等作物与粮棉争地，这些作物很难保证实现种植计划，今年这个矛盾开始得到了解决。长治市郊荫城公社最近通过从山到沟、从近到远全面规划、开展“十利用”：利用小块地、恢复停耕地、利用鱼鳞坑、利用幼树林、利用果树园、利用渠旁路边、断绝小路、取直河床、利用花畦，利用垅背畦堰，种粮食作物、种菜、种油料，初步计算，仅种植的粮食作物就可增产七十五万斤粮食，够两千社员一年的口粮。另外，许多地区注意利用闲散地进行畜圈、厕所、肥坑等田间设备，节省了许多好耕地。
