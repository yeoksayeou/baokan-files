The opening ceremony of the conference was presided over by General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Marshal Luo Ronghuan delivered the opening speech at the conference. In his opening speech, he extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the militia heroes from all walks of life. He said that our country's militia has a long history and a glorious tradition. The militia has made tremendous contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, our country's militia has also made significant achievements. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and under the great call of Chairman Mao to run militia divisions on a large scale, with the emergence of the Great Leap Forward in production and the people's communes with strong vitality, a vigorous upsurge of running militia divisions on a large scale has been set off across the country. This is a major event with far-reaching historical significance. It has greatly accelerated our country's national economic construction and national defense construction. He said that the task of this conference is to further mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the national militia, raise the socialist and communist awareness of the militia, carry forward the glorious tradition of the militia, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and highly leverage role of the militia as a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland and strengthen national defense construction.

Marshal He Long, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at today's conference, extending the warmest congratulations to the conference and the national militia.

The congratulatory speech said that the Party Central Committee and the State Council warmly congratulate the brilliant achievements of our country's militia. These achievements are a brilliant victory for Mao Zedong Thought. In the long revolutionary war, and in our country's economic construction and national defense construction, Chairman Mao creatively applied and developed the Marxist-Leninist thought of arming the people. For more than 30 years, our country's militia has been advancing from victory to victory along the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the future, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead courageously.

The congratulatory speech said that now, our country's socialist construction has entered a new stage, and a situation of high-speed and proportionate sustained leap forward in our country's national economy has been laid. The national militia is a powerful socialist industrial army on the front of production and construction. Widely mobilizing hundreds of millions of militiamen and giving full play to the initiative and creativity of the militia is of great significance for accelerating our country's socialist construction.

The congratulatory speech said that while actively participating in production and construction, we must also be vigilant against the war schemes of U.S. imperialism and actively learn the skills to defend the motherland and defend against imperialist aggression. We are a socialist country, we love peace, and we advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Our social system stipulates that we will not occupy an inch of other people's territory. We are eager to have a very long-term peaceful environment to build socialism. However, when U.S. imperialism still occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, when U.S. imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, expanding military bases around us, and vigorously supporting the resurgence of Japanese militarism, we must not lose the slightest vigilance and relax the necessary precautions. We must strengthen militia construction while strengthening the modernization of the People's Liberation Army, and prepare for defense against imperialist aggression. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our country, we must make them drown in the vast ocean of our country's universal military service.

The congratulatory speech called on the national militia to always follow the teachings of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, guard against arrogance and rashness, unite with the broad masses of the people, hold high the three bright red flags of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industries, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense as soon as possible.

The congratulatory speech of the Party Central Committee and the State Council continuously received warm applause from the audience.

Next, General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a "Report on the Issue of Militia Construction" at the conference. He said that our country's militia system is a system of arming the masses under the guidance of the political and military lines of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. For more than 30 years, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the militia has continued to develop with the development of the revolutionary struggle situation, and it has made great contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War, the Red Guards, Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Forces, and militia organizations formed by the people in various places made great contributions to the establishment and defense of revolutionary base areas, the development and expansion of the people's army, and the persistence in the struggle against the enemy. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, with the victorious development of various movements such as the suppression of bandits, the elimination of local tyrants, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the socialist transformation and socialist construction, the militia organization has been continuously consolidated and strengthened, and has played a huge role. In 1958, when U.S. imperialism carried out serious military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, the people of our country enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, and at the same time as the Great Leap Forward in production and the people's commune movement were vigorously launched, a vigorous movement to run militia divisions on a large scale was set off. This movement has played a major role in promoting the improvement of the socialist and communist awareness of the people and accelerating our country's socialist construction. The vast number of militiamen, whether on the industrial, agricultural, commercial, transportation, financial, engineering, geological exploration, postal and telecommunications, cultural and health, etc. fronts, have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and have become a handy shock force under the leadership of the party committees at all levels, and a strong main force that is invincible on every production front. He pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that the militia division "is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization" is the most scientific theoretical summary of the nature and characteristics of the militia in the era of the people's communes, and a major development of the principle of "combining labor and military" in the new historical conditions. We should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and strengthen militia construction in all aspects.

General Luo Ruiqing said that we are a large socialist country and shoulder the important task of safeguarding world peace. We must have great ambitions and determination to change our country's "poor and blank" state. At this stage, our goal of struggle is to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science, culture, and national defense as soon as possible. We must achieve the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule. Within ten years or less, we must catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products. He said that building socialism and defending socialism are two great and glorious tasks facing the national militia. He said that during the period of peaceful construction, the most central task of the national militia is to muster greater revolutionary drive and actively engage in production and construction. All activities of the militia should take production as the key. The militia on the industrial front must use practical actions to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's industrial production increase tasks. The militia on the agricultural front must resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" and, on the premise of taking grain as the key and increasing grain production, comprehensively arrange and vigorously develop various productions such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, so as to continuously improve the living standards of the people. He demanded that all militiamen actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement; vigorously support agriculture; do their best to run public canteens well; carry out the patriotic health movement on a large scale; the urban militia should actively participate in the people's communes and become the backbone force in the urbanization of the people's communes. The national militia should contribute all their efforts to completing and overfulfilling the 1960 national economic plan and accelerating our country's socialist construction. At the same time, all militiamen must raise their revolutionary vigilance, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to guard the sea, land, and border defenses of the motherland, and establish a strong people's defense line. We never invade others, and we will never allow others to invade us. We adhere to peace and oppose wars of aggression, but we are not afraid of war. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our country, we will give full play to the great power of universal military service, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to fight, and eliminate the enemy wherever they come from.

General Luo Ruiqing said that in order to successfully carry out the glorious task of building and defending the motherland, the national militia must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought, improve socialist and communist awareness; strive to learn the skills to build and defend the motherland; strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge; learn the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and develop a style of unity, tension, liveliness, and seriousness.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the militia is an armed mass organization under the leadership of the Party. Militia work is a part of the Party's entire work. Doing a good job in militia work is an important task for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire people. In the future, we must rely more on the leadership of the Party committees and the close cooperation of all relevant departments, and on the premise of subordinating to production and doing a good job in the central work, further implement the policy of universal military service by vigorously carrying out mass movements, and make greater achievements in militia construction.

Today's conference is a grand gathering of militia heroes from all walks of life. They are full of vigor and high spirits. Some are advanced producers who constantly create miracles on the industrial and agricultural fronts, some are militia heroes who protect production and maintain public security, some are young students who diligently study and strive to climb the peak of science and culture, some are outstanding children of fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas, and some are demobilized, transferred, and retired soldiers who play a backbone role in militia construction. Many old Red Guards, Young Pioneers, and militiamen who made outstanding contributions in the past war years, as well as representatives of the People's Liberation Army who defended the motherland on the defense front, also attended the conference. They continuously expressed their gratitude to the Party and the state for their teachings and encouragement with warm applause, and determined to make greater contributions to the great motherland.

    大会开幕式，由中国人民解放军总政治部主任谭政大将主持。
    罗荣桓元帅在大会上致开幕词。他在开幕词中向各路民兵英雄，表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。他说，我国民兵有着悠久的历史和光荣传统。民兵对我国人民的解放事业作出了巨大的贡献。建国十年来，我国民兵又取得了重大的成就。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛主席大办民兵师的伟大号召下，随着生产大跃进和具有强大生命力的人民公社的出现，全国又掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的大办民兵师的高潮。这是一件具有深远历史意义的大事。它大大加速了我国国民经济建设和国防建设。他说，这次会议的任务，就是要进一步调动全国民兵的革命积极性，提高民兵的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，发扬民兵的光荣传统，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，高度发挥民兵是军事组织、又是劳动组织、又是教育组织、又是体育组织的作用，加速祖国的社会主义建设和加强国防建设。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理贺龙元帅代表中共中央、国务院在今天的大会上致祝词，向大会和全国民兵致以最热烈的祝贺。
    祝词说，党中央、国务院热烈祝贺我国民兵的辉煌成就。这些成就，是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。毛主席在长期的革命战争中，在我国的经济建设和国防建设中，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义武装人民的思想。三十多年来，我国民兵就是沿着毛泽东同志所指示的道路，从胜利走向胜利。今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进。
    祝词说，现在，我国社会主义建设事业，已经进入了一个新的阶段，我国国民经济既高速度、又按比例的持续跃进的局面，已经奠定。全国民兵是生产建设上强大的社会主义产业军。广泛地动员亿万民兵，充分发挥民兵的积极性和创造性，对于加速我国社会主义建设有着非常重大的意义。
    祝词说，在积极参加生产建设的同时，还要警惕美帝国主义的战争阴谋，积极学习保卫祖国、防御帝国主义侵略的本领。我们是社会主义国家，我们热爱和平，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，我们的社会制度规定了我们不会去侵占别人的一寸领土，我们热切地希望有一个很长期的和平环境来建设社会主义。但是，当着美帝国主义还侵占我国领土台湾的时候，当着美帝国主义加紧扩军备战，在我们身边扩大军事基地，并且极力扶持日本军国主义再起的时候，我们绝不能丧失丝毫的警惕和放松应有的戒备。我们必须在加强人民解放军现代化的同时，加强民兵建设，作好防御帝国主义侵略的准备。如果帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，就一定要使它们淹没在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。
    祝词中号召全国民兵，永远遵循党和毛泽东同志的教导，戒骄戒躁，与广大人民团结一致，高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面鲜明的红旗，尽快地把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国。
    党中央和国务院的祝词，不断获得全场持久不息的热烈掌声。
    接着，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，在会上作了“关于民兵建设问题的报告”。他说，我国的民兵制度，是在党中央、毛主席的政治路线和军事路线的指导下武装人民的制度。三十多年来，民兵在党和毛主席的领导下，随着革命斗争形势的发展而不断发展，它对中国人民解放事业作出了伟大的贡献。在第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争时期，各地人民组成的赤卫队、抗日自卫队和民兵组织，在建立、保卫革命根据地，发展、壮大人民军队，坚持对敌斗争中，都作出了巨大的贡献。建国十年来，随着剿匪、反霸、土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝等各项运动和社会主义改造、社会主义建设事业的胜利发展，民兵组织获得了不断的巩固和壮大，并发挥了巨大的作用。1958年，当美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行严重军事挑衅的时候，我国人民热烈地响应了毛主席的伟大号召，在生产大跃进和人民公社化运动蓬勃开展的同时，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大办民兵师运动。这个运动对于提高人民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，加速我国的社会主义建设都起了重大促进作用。广大民兵无论在工业、农业、商业、交通运输、财政金融、工程建筑、地质勘探、邮电通讯、文教卫生等各个战线上，都发挥了高度的劳动热情，成为各级党委领导下得心应手的突击力量，各个生产战线上攻无不克的坚强主力。他指出，毛主席所说民兵师“是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织”的英明论断，这是对人民公社时代民兵的性质和特点最科学的理论概括，是过去战争时期“劳武结合”原则在新的历史条件下的重大发展。我们应该遵循毛主席的指示，从各方面加强民兵建设。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我们是一个社会主义大国，担负着保卫世界和平的重大任务，我们必须树雄心、立大志，改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。在现阶段，我们的奋斗目标，是要尽快地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国，我们要提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要，要在十年或在更少的时间内，在工业主要产品的产量方面，赶上和超过英国。他说，建设社会主义和保卫社会主义，是摆在全国民兵面前两个伟大而光荣的任务。他说，在和平建设时期，全国民兵最中心的任务，就是鼓足更大的革命干劲，积极进行生产建设。民兵的一切活动，都应以生产为纲。在工业战线上的民兵，要用实际行动保证完成和超额完成今年各项工业增产任务。农业战线上的民兵，要坚决贯彻“八字宪法”，在以粮为纲、增产粮食的前提下，全面安排大力发展农、林、牧、副、渔等各种生产，使人民生活水平不断提高。他要求全体民兵要积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动；大力支援农业；千方百计办好公共食堂；大搞爱国卫生运动；城市的民兵，要积极参加人民公社，并成为城市人民公社化的骨干力量。全国民兵都应当为完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划，为加速我国社会主义建设而贡献一切力量。他说，同时，全体民兵必须提高革命警惕，配合人民解放军守卫祖国的海陆边防，建立强大的人民防线。我们从来不侵略别人，我们也绝不容许别人侵略我们，我们坚持和平，反对侵略战争，但也不害怕战争。如果帝国主义敢于对我国发动侵略战争，我们就充分发挥全民皆兵的伟大力量，配合人民解放军作战，敌人从那里来，我们就把它消灭在那里。
    罗瑞卿大将说，为了胜利地执行建设和保卫祖国的光荣任务，全国民兵必须努力学习毛泽东思想，提高社会主义、共产主义觉悟；努力学习建设祖国、保卫祖国的本领；努力学习文化科学知识；学习人民解放军的优良传统，养成团结、紧张、活泼、严肃的作风。
    罗瑞卿大将说，民兵是在党领导下的群众武装。民兵工作是党的整个工作的一部分。作好民兵工作，是全党、全军、全民的重要任务。今后，更要依靠党委的领导和各有关部门的密切配合，在服从生产、作好中心工作的前提下，以大搞群众运动的方法，进一步贯彻全民皆兵的方针，在民兵建设上作出更大的成绩。
    今天的会议，是各路民兵英雄的大聚会，他们生气勃勃，意气风发。有的是工农业战线上不断创造奇迹的先进生产者，有的是保卫生产、维护治安的民兵英雄，有的是刻苦钻研努力攀登科学文化高峰的青年学生，有的是边疆各兄弟民族的优秀子弟，有的是在民兵建设中起骨干作用的复员、转业、退伍军人。许多在过去战争年代功勋卓著的老赤卫队员、少年先锋队员和民兵，以及在国防前线捍卫祖国的人民解放军代表，也出席了会议。他们不断以热烈的掌声，感谢党和国家对他们的教导和鼓励，决心为伟大祖国作出更大的贡献。
