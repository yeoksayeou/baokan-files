Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 national budget draft. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. The reports of the two Vice Premiers are rich and colorful, showing a picture of our nation's people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carrying out a very great socialist construction at a rapid pace, which is truly encouraging.

I have been in the Soviet Union for the past few years. Last autumn, several Soviet friends, after giving short-term academic lectures in our country, returned to the Soviet Union and reported to their colleagues, praising our country's construction achievements in all aspects. They particularly praised our Great Hall of the People, saying that such a magnificent and splendid hall is unparalleled in the world, and that from design to completion of construction, it only took a little over eleven months. This is a Chinese-style scale and Chinese-style speed, a miracle. This time, I attended the National People's Congress as a non-voting delegate and personally saw this great building. While admiring it, I felt that this is a manifestation of the great leap forward in our country's architectural engineering, science, and art. I was extremely happy, so I fully agree with their statement, but I immediately thought that this is just one of many, many miracles! Steel production increased from 8 million tons in 1958 to 13.35 million tons in 1959; last year, 30% of the country's farmland suffered from serious natural disasters, but agricultural production still increased by 16.7% compared to 1958. Isn't that even more of a miracle? It should be said that what was previously considered a miracle has now become a matter of course! This is the product of Mao Zedong Thought: the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, these three magic weapons have fully utilized the power of 650 million people! In such extremely exciting circumstances, everyone is fortunate to have encountered this great era and is willing to contribute all their strength in their respective positions to participate in the great socialist construction! Of course, I am no exception.

I am a scientific worker, currently working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research near Moscow in the Soviet Union. This institute is a joint organization of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, specializing in basic research in nuclear physics. There are many well-known scholars and very important equipment in this institute, such as the world-renowned synchrophasotron and synchrocyclotron that can produce 10 billion electron-volt proton beams. We Chinese scientific workers there understand the spirit of the general line and the great leap forward at home, and we make full use of such good conditions to strive to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet and other countries' researchers, and conduct research in various fields with them, and have achieved many results. The discovery of the anti-sigma minus hyperon, which we recently made in collaboration with scientists from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, is just one relatively significant example. The anti-sigma minus hyperon is an unstable elementary particle. In other aspects, especially in theory, Chinese workers, especially young workers, have many excellent works. The most important reason why we can achieve such results is first of all the leadership of the Party, and secondly the help and collaboration between comrades, especially with comrades from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, who can discuss and solve problems together like brothers. This is also the result of the Party's education. The care and help of the Soviet leaders and other comrades of the institute are also important factors. Making full use of existing conditions, finding the most critical problems, and concentrating efforts to break through them is our method of operation. It should be pointed out that the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was promoted by the Soviet Union's contribution of the above-mentioned two accelerators and other important equipment, and our work was made possible. This is also an example of the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to other socialist countries, and at the same time shows the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. We are never satisfied with the achievements we have already made, but believe that there should be continuous major creations and discoveries. Because we deeply feel that we are on the front line of the international academic arena, and for the glory of the motherland and the glory of the socialist camp, we should make very outstanding achievements. Under the leadership of the Party, we will continue to give full play to our initiative and continuously use our wisdom to vigorously and skillfully attack the basic properties of the nucleus and related aspects, in order to achieve a breakthrough.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is particularly important to us there. Because in addition to rapidly increasing production, it has a very important significance for promoting the progress of scientific research, especially the research and development of cutting-edge science. Many new scientific discoveries or new developments in certain fields are obtained by instruments manufactured using new principles, but sometimes even a small reform can have a great effect. But what we are doing now is far from the previous general, lukewarm, expert-style technical innovation. We must fully mobilize the masses under the leadership of the Party, and, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report said, inspire everyone's soaring enthusiasm and lofty aspirations, break superstitions, liberate our minds, use our brains, dare to think and dare to act, help each other, and cooperate with each other. I believe that only under such circumstances can we achieve results that are more, faster, better, and more economical.

In the past few days, in group discussions and in conversations with friends, I have heard a lot about the great achievements of the motherland in various aspects and countless new people and new things, which have made me very excited, and I want to learn from advanced people to improve my work. More importantly, I must strive to study Mao Zedong's works, study Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's worldview, and follow and apply Chairman Mao's principles and methods to analyze and solve the scientific problems I encounter, as my future goal.

### 猛攻巧攻尖端科学  王淦昌委员的发言

    猛攻巧攻尖端科学
    王淦昌委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的政协常务委员会的工作报告。两位副总理的报告，丰富多彩，表现了我全国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，以飞快的速度，进行非常伟大的社会主义建设的图景，令人欢欣鼓舞。
    我最近几年在苏联。去年秋天，有几位苏联朋友在我国作短期学术讲演之后，回至苏联后向他们自己的同事们作报告，盛赞我国各方面的建设成就，特别对于我们的人民大会堂，称赞不止，说这样宏伟壮丽的大会堂，是举世无匹的，并且自设计至建筑完成，前后只有十一个多月，这是中国式的规模和中国式的速度，是一个奇迹。这次我列席人大会议，亲自看到了这个伟大的建筑，瞻仰之余，觉得这是我国在建筑工程、科学和艺术方面大跃进的一种表现，心中万分高兴，所以完全同意他们的说法，但马上就想到这不过是很多很多的奇迹中的一个而已。钢产量自1958年的八百万吨增加到1959年的一千三百三十五万吨；去年全国农田有30％遭受了严重自然灾害，但农业生产还是比1958年增产了16.7％，不更是奇迹么？应该说，在从前认为是奇迹的，现在已成为当然的事了！这是由于毛泽东思想的产物：总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝充分发挥了六亿五千万人民的力量的成果！在这样极其振奋人心的情况下，每个人都庆幸自己逢着了这个伟大的时代，而愿意在自己的岗位上贡献出全部力量，来参加伟大的社会主义建设！我当然也不是例外。
    我是一个科学工作者，现在苏联莫斯科近郊联合原子核研究所工作。这个研究所是以苏联为首的社会主义各国的联合机构，专门做原子核物理的基本研究。在这个研究所里，有不少知名学者，和很重要的设备，如闻名于世的能产生一百亿电子优质子束的同步稳相加速器和同步回旋加速器。我们在那里的中国科学工作者，都领会国内总路线、大跃进的精神，充分利用这样好的条件，努力学习苏联和其他各国研究人员的先进经验，和他们一起进行着各方面的研究工作，获得了不少的成绩。最近在苏联及其他兄弟国家科学家的协作下，我们发现的反西格马负超子，只是一个比较显著的例子。反西格马负超子是一种不稳定的基本粒子。在其他方面，特别是理论方面，中国工作者，特别青年工作者，有不少优秀的论著，我们所以能得到如此的成绩，最重要的首先是党的领导，其次是同志间的帮助和协作，特别是和苏联及其他社会主义各国的同志们，能亲如兄弟般共同讨论问题和解决问题，这也是党的教育的结果。研究所的苏联领导和其他同志们对我们的关怀和帮助，也是重要的因素。充分利用现有条件，找出最关键性的问题，集中力量来突破它，这是我们作战的方法。应该指出，由于苏联献出上述两个加速器、和其他重要设备，促进了联合原子核研究所的建立，我们的工作也才有可能实现。这也是苏联对社会主义其他各国的无私援助的一个例子，同时也表明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。我们对于已有成绩，绝不感到满足，而认为应该有不断的重大的创造与发现。因为我们深深感到自己是处在国际学术竞赛场的最前线，为祖国的光荣，为社会主义阵营的光荣，应该做出非常特出的成绩。我们一定在党的领导下不断互相发挥积极性，不断运用智慧，向原子核的基本性质及有关方面，进行猛攻和巧攻，以达到突破的目的。
    技术革新和技术革命运动，在我们那里是特别感到重要的。因为它除了可以使生产的快速增加外，对于推动科学研究的进展，特别是尖端科学的研究和发展，有极重大的意义。科学上新的发现或某一方面新的开展，很多是依靠用新的原理制造的仪器而得到的，但有时也可以因为一点小的改革，而发生极大的效果。但我们现在要搞的，远不是从前一般冷冷清清专家式的技术革新，我们是要在党的领导之下，充分发动群众，要像李富春副总理报告所说的：鼓舞大家的冲天干劲和雄心壮志，破除迷信，解放思想，开动脑筋，敢想敢干，互相帮助，大家协作。相信只有在这样情况之下，才能多快好省地得出成果。
    几天以来，在小组讨论会上，在与朋友们的谈话中，听到很多关于祖国各方面的伟大成就，和无数的新人新事，使我非常振奋，并要好好向先进人物学习，来改进自己的岗位工作。更重要的是要努力学好毛泽东著作，学习毛泽东思想和毛泽东的世界观，遵循和运用毛主席的原理和方法来分析和解决所碰到的科学问题，作为我今后的奋斗目标。
