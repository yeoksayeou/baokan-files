　　"Draw your sword to help when you see injustice on the road." This is a virtue that has always been prevalent among the people of our country. But in the old society, not everyone could do it. On the contrary, the hardships of life made some people only care about their own food and clothing, and they no longer had the heart to care about other people's affairs. The arrogance and tyranny of evil forces often caused some people to suffer harm when they helped the weak and rescued those in distress, bringing trouble upon themselves. Over time, people learned a lesson: as long as it doesn't concern you, it's best to stay away. "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on his neighbor's roof," is a negative experience that people have learned after suffering painful lessons.

　　"Mind your own business!" This was the philosophy of life for many people in the old society. And they called anything that didn't concern them "idle business."

　　Today, the situation is completely different. Due to the abolition of the system of exploitation of man by man, a new relationship has emerged between people, one that has never existed in history. People do not regard other people's affairs as "idle business," but regard serving others as a duty and an honor. What people consider is not how to make themselves comfortable, but how to make others happy. Heartwarming and tear-jerking deeds of running around to rescue the injured and sick, even at the expense of one's own life, can be seen everywhere. "Leave the difficulties to yourself and make it easier for others." Things that could only be found in fantasy novels in the past have become a common phenomenon in our society.

　　In the old society, where darkness and injustice were everywhere, it was indeed not easy to stand up for those who were bullied, and such personal advocacy could not solve the problem. Don Quixote rescued a shepherd boy who was being whipped by his employer, but as soon as Mr. Quixote left, the shepherd boy suffered even more and was beaten even harder. Only in a society that fundamentally changes the system of cannibalism and fundamentally eliminates "injustice" can people truly establish a relationship of mutual help and love. A new noble virtue of "others first, self second," "public first, private second," and "taking the happiness of others as one's own happiness" can become the code of conduct commonly followed by the broad masses of the people.

　　In bourgeois society, it is "everyone for themselves, only God for everyone." In fact, the so-called God also protects the wallets of the bourgeoisie. "Heaven punishes those who are not for themselves," which was originally the moral code of the exploiters. However, the bourgeoisie and its "pastors" always like to preach "humanity," "universal love," etc., to carry out deception. These cunning hypocrites, having drunk their fill of the blood of others, pretend to be unable to bear to harm even a fly. However, the swallow-tailed coats of the gentlemen and the robes of the "pastors" cannot hide the egoistic fox tails of the bourgeoisie. They preach "love your neighbor as yourself." This precisely proves that "loving oneself" is their highest morality and the starting point of all their actions.

　　In class society, there is no such thing as trans-class "love." Master Zhao would not love Ah Q, and Ah Q would not love Master Zhao. The bourgeoisie not only does not love the working class, the "neighbor" who provides them with profits, but even does not love those less powerful "neighbors" within their own class. In addition to extracting the blood and sweat of the working class, they also carry out mutual plunder and mutual devouring within their own class. Whoever has the most capital and the most power is the victor, and who can annex other people's property. They only love their own money vaults. The bourgeoisie are the most ferocious, most greedy, and most selfish egoists in history.

　　Engels said that people have been talking about the "kingdom of love" for more than 1,800 years, but they have never changed the unreasonable society. The "kingdom of love" has never appeared in the world. Today's bourgeois "pastors" are still preaching the "kingdom of love" in the same way, and their purpose is to consolidate their crumbling capitalist hell. Only by destroying this dark hell and abolishing the system of exploitation of man by man can the "kingdom of love" truly appear. Therefore, a person who truly loves the people must also strongly hate exploitation and the old system. "One can only love if one can hate." Only when the working people unite and shatter the unreasonable old system with the greatest hatred can the flowers of mutual help and love, which have been suppressed and ravaged for a long time among the working people, bloom with brilliance, just as we see today.

### 从“少管闲事”谈到“爱的天国”

    从“少管闲事”谈到“爱的天国”
    林默涵
    “路见不平，拔刀相助”。这是我国人民中一向流传的一种美德。但在旧社会里，这并不是人人都能做到的。相反，生活的艰辛，使一些人只知道全力忙着自己的吃穿，再也无心去管别人的事情。而恶势力的跋扈横行，又使一些人往往因为扶危救难而自身受害，把祸事惹到自己头上。久而久之，人们就得到一个教训：只要事不干己，最好远远走开。“各人自扫门前雪，休管他家瓦上霜”，就是人们由于受了痛苦教训后得出的一条消极的经验。
    “少管闲事！”这是旧社会许多人的处世哲学。而他们是把凡是不关自己的事情一律叫做“闲事”的。
    今天的情形完全不同了。由于废除了人剥削人的制度，人与人之间就出现了一种历史上从未有过的新的关系。人们不是把别人的事情当作“闲事”，而是把为别人服务当作应尽的职责，当作无上的光荣。人们所考虑的，不是如何使自己舒服，而是如何使别人愉快。为了救急扶伤而奔走辛劳、甚至不惜牺牲自己的可歌可泣的事迹，到处可见。“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”，在从前只有幻想小说里才能有的事情，在我们的社会里，已经成为生活中的普遍现象了。
    在遍地是黑暗和不平的旧社会里，要为那些受欺凌的人们打抱不平，确是一件不容易的事情，而且这种个人的打抱不平，也并不能解决问题。唐吉呵德救了一个被雇主鞭挞的牧童，等吉呵德先生一走，那牧童却反而吃了更大的苦头，挨了更狠的一顿揍。只有在根本改变了人吃人的制度，根本消灭了“不平”的社会里，人们之间才有可能真正建立起互助友爱的关系，一种新的“先人后己”、“先公后私”、“以别人的幸福为幸福”的高尚美德，才能成为广大人民所共同遵行的生活道德。
    在资产阶级社会里，是“人人为自己，只有上帝为大家”，其实所谓的上帝也是护佑资产阶级的钱包的。“人不为己，天诛地灭”，这本来是剥削者的生活道德，但资产阶级和它所豢养的“牧师”们总是喜欢宣扬什么“人道”、“博爱”等等来实行欺骗。这些老奸巨滑的伪君子，喝饱了别人的血，却装出连苍蝇也不忍伤害的样子。但是，绅士的燕尾服和“牧师”的法衣都掩盖不住资产阶级利己主义的狐狸尾巴。他们宣传什么“要爱你的邻人，像爱你自己一样”。这恰恰证明了“爱自己”才是他们的最高道德，才是他们的一切行为的出发点。
    在阶级社会里，是没有什么超阶级的“爱”的。赵太爷不会爱阿Q，阿Q也不爱赵太爷。而资产阶级不但不爱工人阶级这个为他们提供利润的“邻人”，甚至也不爱他们本阶级里那些势力较小的“邻人”，他们除了榨取工人阶级的血汗之外，还在他们本阶级里面实行互相掠夺、互相吞噬，而谁的资本最雄厚，势力最强大，谁就是胜利者，谁就能把别人的财产吞并掉。他们只爱自己的钱柜子。资产阶级是历史上最凶残最贪婪最自私的利己主义者。
    恩格斯说过，人们讲“爱的天国”，讲了一千八百多年，始终没有把不合理的社会改变，“爱的天国”始终没有在人间出现。今天的资产阶级“牧师”们还在照样宣扬“爱的天国”，其目的正是为了巩固他们的摇摇欲坠的资本主义地狱。只有摧毁了这个黑暗的地狱，废除了人剥削人的制度，然后才可能真正出现“爱的天国”。因此，一个真正热爱人民的人，一定同时是强烈地憎恨剥削、憎恨旧制度的人。“能憎始能爱”，只有当劳动人民团结起来，以最大的仇恨彻底粉碎了不合理的旧制度之后，在劳动人民之间的长期受压抑受摧残的互助友爱的花朵才能光华焕发地盛开起来，就像我们今天所看到的一样。
