Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 27th:  Krim Belkacem, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, who led the Algerian delegation to visit China, North Korea, and Vietnam, issued a statement at Cairo Airport on the morning of the 27th before flying to Beijing. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    This is not the first time that an Algerian delegation has visited the People's Republic of China.  We are proud of the firm and friendly ties linking our two peoples, ties strengthened by the profound response in this great country to the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

    The People's Republic of China was one of the first countries to recognize the Algerian government.

    The Algerian government, at the invitation of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, is eager to strengthen this friendship. The Algerian government is willing to consolidate our common struggle for peace in national independence and freedom through direct contact with the great Chinese people and their wise leaders.

    Our delegation is also pleased to be able to visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, two friendly countries that recognized our government immediately after its establishment, at their invitation.

    The Algerian people have been fighting this most barbaric colonial war for nearly six years. The scale of this war is truly devastating, with French colonialism, supported by the imperialist alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pouring in its manpower and material resources. But French colonialism cannot and will never achieve its goal of conquering our revolution.

    The Algerian people have accepted the most cruel sacrifices in their liberation struggle. They are convinced of final victory. The Algerian people and their children draw courage and determination from their belief in the victory of the revolution. They feel that the support of freedom-loving countries, first and foremost the People's Republic of China, is strong, and they feel that the support of 80 million Arabs is strong, for whom the Algerian people's struggle is the liberation struggle of the entire Arab nation.

    The peoples of Africa and Asia, who have realized that the Algerian revolution plays a decisive role in the overall struggle against colonialism and imperialism, are also supporting us.

    For us Algerians—as for all peoples—the People's Republic of China, with its great achievements built on the ruins of feudal and foreign imperialist oppression, is both an example and an encouragement.

    Our visits to China, North Korea, and Vietnam have all the significance as our national independence is being planned and beginning to take shape. We are convinced that this visit will strengthen the existing solid ties between us and these countries that have already realized one of the greatest revolutions in human history. We are convinced that the results of this visit will help accelerate the victory of the Algerian people.

    贝勒卡塞姆就访问中朝越三国发表声明
    阿尔及利亚人民充满胜利信心
    中国的成就是对阿尔及利亚人民的鼓励
    新华社开罗27日电　率领阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团到中国、朝鲜和越南访问的阿尔及利亚副总理兼外交部长克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆，27日上午在乘飞机前往北京之前在开罗机场发表声明。声明全文如下：
    阿尔及利亚代表团访问中华人民共和国这不是首次。阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争在这个伟大的国家所发生的深刻反响连结了我们两国人民的友好的巩固联系，对此我们引以自豪。
    中华人民共和国是最早承认阿尔及利亚政府的国家之一。
    在应中华人民共和国政府邀请的时候，阿尔及利亚政府怀着加强这种友谊的心情。阿尔及利亚政府愿意通过和伟大的中国人民及其英明的领袖进行直接接触，来巩固我们在民族独立和自由中争取和平的共同斗争。
    我们代表团也应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的邀请，能够访问在阿尔及利亚政府一成立即承认我们的这两个友好国家，我们代表团对此预先表示高兴。
    阿尔及利亚人民迎击这场最野蛮的殖民战争即将六年。这场战争的规模具有真正的毁灭性，法国殖民主义在北大西洋公约组织的帝国主义联盟的支持下投入了它的人力和物力。但是法国殖民主义不能也决不可能达到征服我们革命的目的。
    阿尔及利亚人民在其解放斗争中接受了最残酷的牺牲。她深信最后的胜利。她对革命胜利的信念使阿尔及利亚人民及其孩子们产生出勇敢和决心。她感到爱好自由的国家首先是中华人民共和国的支持是强有力的，她感到八千万阿拉伯人对她的支援是强有力的，对这八千万阿拉伯人来说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争就是整个阿拉伯民族的解放斗争。
    已意识到阿尔及利亚革命在反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义的总斗争中起着决定性作用的非洲和亚洲的人民，他们也支援我们。
    对我们阿尔及利亚人来说，——一如对所有各国人民——，中华人民共和国由于它在封建和外国帝国主义压迫的废墟上建立起来的伟大成就，既是一个榜样，也是一个鼓励。
    当我们的民族独立正在筹划并开始成形的时候，我们去中国、朝鲜、越南的访问具有一切的意义。我们深信，这次访问将使我们和这些已实现了人类最伟大的一种革命的国家之间既有的巩固联系得到加强。我们深信，我们这次访问所获得的结果将有助于加速阿尔及利亚人民的胜利。
