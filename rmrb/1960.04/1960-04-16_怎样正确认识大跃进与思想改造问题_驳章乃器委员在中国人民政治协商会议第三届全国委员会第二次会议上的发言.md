We recently attended the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and listened to the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. We felt very excited and encouraged. During the conference, we also heard speeches from many committee members, who, from different perspectives and work positions, praised the great victories of socialist construction in the motherland, the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. These speeches greatly educated and inspired us. However, one committee member's speech, namely the written speech of Committee Member Zhang Naiqi, was fundamentally different from the tone of other committee members. He maliciously distorted, satirized, and attacked the General Line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the political and ideological remolding work that the democratic parties are about to strengthen, which aroused indignation among many comrades. However, because his speech was relatively obscure and some people who are not familiar with him may not easily recognize its poisonous nature, we are writing this article to express our understanding of the General Line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the political and ideological remolding work, and to refute Committee Member Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. From these fallacies of Committee Member Zhang Naiqi, we can also recognize that although our era is a great era of continuous leap forward, there are always a small number of people, like Committee Member Zhang Naiqi, who are unwilling to keep up with the progress of the times. We should be vigilant against such people and wage unremitting struggles against them.

(I)

We are in a great era of continuing socialist revolution and sustained leap forward in socialist construction. In this new historical period, the economic, political, and social landscape of our country has undergone unprecedented changes. Chairman Mao's incisive exposition on the relationship and interaction between productive forces and production relations, and between the economic base and the superstructure, is playing a huge guiding role in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, constantly reforming the relations of production and the superstructure opens up broad avenues for the continuous development of productive forces. The continuous development of productive forces, in turn, compels the relations of production and the superstructure to undergo constant reform." This is indeed the case. The continuous leap forward in our country's industrial and agricultural production has promoted the continuous revolution in people's thinking, and the continuous revolution in thinking has in turn influenced and accelerated the leap forward in production. In order to meet the requirements of the continued upward development of productive forces, all aspects of the relations of production need to be adjusted at any time, and at the same time, all aspects of the superstructure built on this economic base also need to be adjusted at any time. Contradictions between productive forces and production relations, and between the economic base and the superstructure, constantly arise and are overcome, overcome and arise again, and social productive forces advance continuously in this way. Chairman Mao has always opposed both the idealists who deny that existence determines consciousness and the mechanical materialists who only see things and not the subjective initiative of people. He has always adhered to and constantly applied dialectical materialism, on the one hand, fully estimating the objective laws of things, that is, fully estimating objective possibilities; at the same time, he advocates fully developing the conscious initiative of the people, and acknowledging the significant reaction of social consciousness on social existence, the superstructure on the economic base, and the spirit on matter. Chairman Mao, based on the Marxist-Leninist principle of the interaction between productive forces and production relations, and between the economic base and the superstructure, combined the subjective initiative of our country's 600 million people with the objective possibility of the high-speed development of the socialist economy and put forward the General Line for socialist construction. "Going all out, aiming high, is to implement political leadership and fully develop people's initiative according to the objective laws of socialist economic development; achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is to require in production and construction to improve the speed of development as much as possible, fully develop economic effects, and continuously strengthen the material and technical base. That is to say, politics and economics must be unified." (Li Fuchun).

This is the essence of the General Line for socialist construction as we understand it. We believe that carefully studying the Party's line, principles, and policies and obtaining a correct understanding is the basic condition for doing all work well. Therefore, in our country, the vast majority of people not only support the Party's line, principles, and policies, but also humbly study to obtain a correct understanding. Only those with ulterior motives will deliberately distort the Party's line, principles, and policies. Zhang Naiqi's speech is a clear example of distorting and attacking the General Line of socialist construction.

Zhang Naiqi said: "In doing anything, it is not enough to only emphasize the aspect of necessity; one must also find out and explain the aspect of its inevitability, only then can it be considered that subjective and objective are consistent." How does Zhang Naiqi understand "necessity" and "inevitability"? He said: "The common aspiration of 650 million people seems to be only a spiritual thing and can only represent necessity. How can it constitute an objective law and constitute inevitability? Here is a well-known saying of Marx: 'Theory, once it seizes the masses, immediately becomes a material force.' But this sentence refers to the aspect of 'going to the masses,' while 'reflecting objective laws' refers to the aspect of 'coming from the masses.' ... Here, the ancient saying 'Unity is strength' is in line with the dialectical materialist viewpoint and also has a mass viewpoint. It shows that the common aspiration of the people becomes a powerful material force. Stalin more clearly pointed out: 'There are phenomena of ideas and phenomena of matter in the world.' This way of listing the phenomena of ideas as an aspect of objective existence (of course, secondary) is frequently seen in classical works. But for those who are new to materialism, it is often not easy to understand at once; mechanical materialists will never understand it."

Here, Zhang Naiqi believes that the desire of 650 million people to change our country's poverty and backwardness is the objective law of our country's General Line of socialist construction, which represents both necessity and constitutes inevitability, and he cites Marx's famous saying as the basis for his theory. We believe that this is a distortion of Marxism. Yes, we attach great importance to the great productive force of 650 million people, but without socialist revolution, could the enthusiasm of 650 million people be brought into play? Obviously not. Before liberation, didn't the 600 million people have a common desire to get rid of poverty and backwardness? But why was it impossible for their common aspiration to be realized before liberation? This is because at that time there were still three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism weighing on our people. This kind of semi-colonial and semi-feudal relations of production hindered the development of our country's productive forces and hindered the realization of the common aspiration of our people. Only by overthrowing the rule of the three major enemies, changing the old relations of production, and liberating the people from the old society to become the masters of the new society can the people fully develop their enthusiasm and creativity. This is one point. Secondly, even after the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, our working people have become the masters of the new China, but why couldn't our country achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy before 1958? Didn't the 650 million people in China at that time still have a strong desire to get rid of poverty and backwardness? Of course not. So what is the reason? On the one hand, it is because before the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, we had not yet prepared favorable material conditions for the rapid development of our country's economy, but more importantly, it was also because the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce had not yet been completed during the First Five-Year Plan, and the true comrade-like cooperative relationship between people in the production process had not yet been established. The influence of the bourgeoisie on the political and ideological fronts still seriously existed, and all this limited the发挥fāhuī (bring into play/develop) of the laboring people's production enthusiasm. Only after the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956, followed by the rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, and the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, did the social productive forces and the production enthusiasm of the laboring people obtain unprecedented liberation. The Party then timely proposed and implemented the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." This General Line centrally reflected the strong desire of our country's 650 million people to rapidly change the situation of "poverty and backwardness" and build our country into a strong socialist country, and also accurately reflected the superiority of the socialist economy and the inevitability of high-speed development. This is how our country's socialist construction has seen the Great Leap Forward since 1958. It can be seen from this that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes were not subjectively fantasized by any one person. It is the inevitable product of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is precisely because the Party has grasped the objective laws of development and correctly combined the objective laws with the enthusiasm, creativity, and consciousness of the broad masses of the laboring people that the magnificent and sustained leap forward has appeared. Mastering the objective laws enables us to move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. Without objective laws as a basis, our continued Great Leap Forward is unimaginable.

Zhang Naiqi, however, simply regards the necessity and inevitability of the General Line as the common aspiration of 650 million people. On the surface, he seems to attach great importance to the important factor of the subjective initiative of the people, but in essence, he wants to deny that our General Line is the product of objective laws. He also denies that the General Line is the product of the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. He deliberately confused objective possibilities with subjective initiative; deliberately ignored the role of the socialist revolution, that is, the relations of production and the superstructure, on the productive forces and the economic base, thus regarding the General Line as the product of our subjective consciousness, without any objective basis. This is another clever way of slandering our Great Leap Forward as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism."

(II)

Zhang Naiqi, precisely because he made a completely idealist interpretation of the General Line, seriously distorted our Great Leap Forward. In his speech, there is a passage using the squares of the manuscript paper to draw a picture, concluding that: "Looking at the picture, I found that the step-by-step rise of our national economy is inevitable, and it becomes easier the further we go. However, if we only require the step-by-step rise of the level distance, that is, developing according to roughly the same absolute number in each period (three or five years), that is still a lazybones' thought." Then, what must be done to avoid being considered a "lazybones' thought"? He said, "The development of our national economy is by no means the 'person climbing stairs' that becomes more and more difficult the further we go, but a multi-stage rocket in rising acceleration. The speed of our national economic development in each period (three or five years) will never be an arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...), but should be a geometric progression (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...), that is, the speed of a sustained Great Leap Forward." According to Zhang Naiqi, only the leap forward speed of geometric progression is the speed of a sustained Great Leap Forward. If we "only require the step-by-step rise of the level distance," or rise in arithmetic progression, it cannot be counted as a "sustained leap forward."

On the surface, Zhang Naiqi seems to be more optimistic about the speed of the leap forward than any of us. He requires our leap forward to rise in geometric progression. In essence, he is using this to deny our current Great Leap Forward. Because we are not the Monkey King after all, who can pull out a hair and turn it into millions of Monkey Kings. Premier Zhou said: "Judging from the development speed of socialist countries' economic construction and the construction experience of our country's First Five-Year Plan, it should be said that an annual increase of more than 20% in industry is a leap forward, an increase of more than 25% is a Great Leap Forward, and an increase of more than 30% is an extraordinary Great Leap Forward; an annual increase of more than 10% in agriculture is a leap forward, an increase of more than 15% is a Great Leap Forward, and an increase of more than 20% is an extraordinary Great Leap Forward." We completely agree with Premier Zhou's scientific analysis. Premier Zhou also said: "Observing the speed of growth cannot only look at the percentage, but must also look at the absolute number at the same time. If it is believed that the annual increase in the percentage of the total output value of industry and agriculture and the output of each product must be higher than the previous year to be considered a leap forward, that is unrealistic." But Zhang Naiqi believes that our development speed must rise in geometric progression of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... to be considered a "sustained leap forward," thereby achieving his goal of denying the Great Leap Forward. But anyone with a little common sense knows that it is fundamentally impossible for the development speed of the national economy to rise in geometric progression. Does Zhang Naiqi really not even have this bit of economic common sense? In connection with Zhang Naiqi's consistently adhered-to position and his attitude towards socialism, isn't he essentially denying our Great Leap Forward!

Secondly, our country's 1960 national economic plan is a plan for sustained leap forward, and at the same time, it is a plan that must be completed and over-fulfilled through subjective efforts. Precisely because of this, Vice Premier Li Fuchun mobilized the people of the whole country in his report to go all out and发挥fāhuī (bring into play/develop) subjective initiative to realize this grand plan. But in Zhang Naiqi's view, it is not like this. He said: "The step-by-step rise of our national economy is inevitable, and it becomes easier the further we go." As everyone knows, the opposite is true, because "the base number is large, and the value of each percentage increase also expands, and it takes greater effort to complete it." (Premier Zhou) In our view, we believe that "it takes greater effort the further we go," but in Committee Member Zhang Naiqi's view, he believes that "it becomes easier the further we go." It should be said that his purpose is to relax our fighting spirit and tell us not to make any subjective efforts.

Another poisonous arrow that Committee Member Zhang Naiqi aimed at the national economic plan was to spread pessimistic doubts about the leap forward in our country's agricultural production. In the fifth section, he said: "Compared with industry, the conditions for the leap forward in agricultural production are relatively harsh. In terms of natural conditions, the expansion of arable land is first of all limited, natural disasters cannot be completely avoided, and in addition, the supply of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers is not sufficient. Therefore, the percentage of industrial production cannot be mechanically used for the speed of the leap forward in agricultural production. 'Even an annual increase of 10% to 20% is already considered a leap forward.' This is what Premier Zhou pointed out in last year's 'Government Work Report.' This remark has foreshadowed that the 1958 agricultural statistics need to be revised, and also set a standard for the adjustment of the 1959 agricultural production targets and the arrangement of this year's agricultural production plan." This passage is hidden with poison. First of all, Committee Member Zhang Naiqi does not mention a word about the favorable conditions for this year's agricultural production increase, such as the increasingly发挥fāhuī (bring into play/develop) superiority of the well-developed rural People's Communes, and the magnificent agricultural technological innovation movement that is underway, which creates favorable conditions for the improvement of agricultural labor productivity; on the contrary, he emphasizes the inability to expand arable land, the inability to completely avoid natural disasters, and the inability to fully supply agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc., to illustrate that the prospects for the agricultural leap forward are not good, which is already absurd enough. But the most vicious thing is that he distorted Premier Zhou's words in last year's "Government Work Report" at the People's Congress that an annual increase of 10%-20% in agriculture is considered a leap forward. On the one hand, he attacked our Great Leap Forward as having no objective standards; on the other hand, he actually slandered the Premier's words as "reserving room" for adjusting the indicators last year, which cannot but make us feel very angry. We know that the reason why the 1958 agricultural output was estimated to be too high was clearly stated by the Premier in his report on adjusting the indicators at last year's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Even after the adjustment, it cannot shake the fact that my country's agricultural output in 1958 was a Great Leap Forward. What is the relationship between the adjustment of last year's grain and cotton targets and Premier Zhou's words about the speed of agricultural leap forward? Then, Zhang Naiqi said: "In addition, agricultural statistics have shown the advantages of comprehensive management. In 1959, due to the sharp increase in the income from rural sideline production nationwide, it made up for the loss of agriculture due to severe natural disasters and the failure to complete the grain plan, so that the total agricultural output value still reached the speed of a leap forward." According to Vice Premier Li in the report, grain actually reached 540.1 billion catties. This number is not much different from the adjusted target of 550 billion catties last year (the original said that the increase would be about 10%). Because some areas of our country suffered a severe drought last year that had not been seen in decades, the grain completed the 8% increase plan. We have never concealed this fact. Even in terms of the 8% increase, it is still a leap forward. But Zhang Naiqi said with ulterior motives that because agricultural statistics played the characteristics of "comprehensive management," we used the sharp increase in the income from rural sideline production to make up for the failure to complete the grain plan, so that the total agricultural output value still reached the speed of a leap forward. We know that during the First Five-Year Plan period, my country's grain increased by an average of 3.3% annually, while in 1959, under the condition of particularly severe disasters, grain still increased by 8%. This is not only absolutely impossible in capitalist countries, but also should be considered very fast in socialist countries. However, according to Zhang Naiqi, it seems that we used the method of calculating agricultural production and sideline production together to make the total agricultural output value reach the speed of a leap forward. Isn't this a deliberate slander of the great fact that my country's agricultural production was still a leap forward last year!

(III)

The second poisonous arrow in Zhang Naiqi's speech is aimed at the Party's policy of remolding the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals. This is the sixth part of his speech on three issues of ideological work. This part of the article seems particularly obscure, incomprehensible, illogical, and confused. This reminds us of Hu Feng's articles in the past. When a person wants to say something that is not convenient to say directly, but cannot but express it in a roundabout way, it often gives people this feeling.

The sixth part of Zhang Naiqi's speech is about the issue of ideological remolding. In theory, when discussing ideological remolding, one cannot but talk about the fundamental issue of the bourgeois standpoint and worldview versus the proletarian standpoint and worldview, and one cannot but talk about the struggle between the two roads; one cannot but talk about how to remold the bourgeois standpoint and worldview. But we all know that Zhang Naiqi has consistently opposed the fundamental remolding of bourgeois elements and has consistently denied that there is an essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class. This speech once again proves that his reactionary stance has not changed in the slightest. We see that Zhang Naiqi, in a whole long passage about the issue of ideological work, does not mention the fundamental issue of the proletarian standpoint, worldview, and the bourgeois standpoint, worldview, and only makes a big fuss about "the situation is pressing," "being moved to the heart," and so on. We can't help but ask: What is the essence of the ideological issue? If it is ideological remolding, is it to remold bourgeois elements into the working class? Or is it to remold the working class into the bourgeoisie? Judging from Zhang Naiqi's consistent remarks, it is all the same anyway. The bourgeoisie needs to be remolded, and the working class also needs to be remolded. The working class has advanced figures, and the bourgeoisie also has "the legacy of Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya" and "the model of Tao Zhu." It can be seen from this that it is inevitable that we should feel strange when discussing ideological remolding without talking about who to remold, what to remold, and what standards to use for remolding. But according to Zhang Naiqi's logic, it is completely understandable.

Secondly, Zhang Naiqi has consistently opposed the fundamental remolding of bourgeois elements. He believes that "transformation" can only "end with death." This speech proves that his point of view has not changed. In his speech, there is a long passage about the "ideological boxes," "work specifications," and "life norms" of old senior intellectuals. He said: "Some work 'specifications' may not change much, and some do not need to be changed immediately." "'Ideological boxes' ... the original complete set only needs to be dismantled into individual 'boxes,' or the individual 'boxes' can be further dismantled into parts and materials, and then appropriately processed and transformed, so that they all become useful parts, parts, and materials. The seriousness of the problem lies only in the formation of the box, and the box becomes a set. The material is not guilty. Analyzing our science and culture, analyzing to the end, it is possible that most of the material is a 'legacy.' In the great era, broken copper, scrap iron, broken bricks, and zero wood have all been searched empty, and there is definitely not much 'useless material.'" This long passage is very obscure and unclear. In fact, opening the window and speaking frankly, it is just saying: "The bourgeois ideological system, working methods, worldview, etc., do not need to be transformed; or do not need to be transformed immediately (such as the work 'specifications' he said); some do not need to be completely transformed (his so-called ideological 'boxes'). As long as the bourgeois ideological system is not presented intact, slightly changing the face and repairing it can be completely used." We want to break down and establish on a large scale, break down the bourgeois standpoint, ideology, and worldview, and establish the proletarian standpoint, ideology, and worldview. The deeper the breakdown, the more thorough the establishment. He wants us to change the face and basically not move. As long as the box is dismantled and appropriately processed and transformed, it will all become "useful material." Isn't this denying the need for fundamental transformation? Zhang Naiqi may ask: Is there no usable material in bourgeois science? Yes, some materials in capitalist science, technology, and social sciences can be used, and part of our cultural heritage is left to us by capitalist society. But what we are talking about here is the issue of ideological remolding. The so-called issue of ideological remolding refers to the issue of the transformation of the bourgeois worldview. If this issue is not resolved, there is no way to talk about whether the material is useful or not, and the enthusiasm for serving socialism. The "ideological boxes," "work specifications," and "life norms" that Zhang Naiqi said are all related to bourgeois ideology, working methods, and lifestyle issues. What he wants to retain in whole or in part is exactly what we must destroy with all our strength.

Thirdly, many intellectuals feel that the situation is pressing and they must strengthen the transformation, which in our view is a great thing. But in Zhang Naiqi's view, the opposite is true. He believes that it is good not to feel that the situation is pressing. He said, "There is nothing mysterious about not feeling that the situation is pressing. One method is to constantly grasp the development of the objective situation, and think one step ahead. If life is too high, prepare to temporarily (but only temporarily) retreat one or two steps. ... Another ... is to completely trust the great Mao Zedong era ... put yourself in the objective situation and become a component of the situation. Then there will be no question of whether it is pressing or not." It is probably the case that Zhang Naiqi believes that he himself is "constantly grasping the development of the objective situation" and "thinking one step ahead," so he will not feel that the situation is pressing. In our view, the objective world cannot but affect the subjective world, and when the subjective world recognizes the regularity of the objective world, it will in turn affect the objective world. Is there anyone who is not affected by the objective world? Then there is only a granite head. As for what Committee Member Zhang Naiqi said about "completely trusting the great Mao Zedong era and putting yourself in the objective situation," in essence, it is just another way of saying to let things take their own course and not发挥fāhuī (bring into play/develop) the consciousness of transformation and subjective initiative.

Fourthly, regarding the issue of "being moved to the heart" and "not being moved to the heart" during visits and inspections. Many comrades have improved their understanding through visits and inspections, that is, through social practice, and love socialism and our leader Chairman Mao more, and recognize more the absolute correctness of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Many committee members' speeches this time have this understanding, which in our view is also a great thing to strengthen self-transformation. But how does Zhang Naiqi view this issue? He said, "The correct method is to affirm 'everyone is moved,' and then analyze the various different dynamic phenomena and essence." So he divided people who are "moved to the heart" into four categories: "One is people with a high degree of master consciousness. They often pay attention to the development of the country and society, and they generally know everything about new things. ... The movement of this kind of person is the most normal and also the most common." "The second kind is people who 'sleep soundly' in the 'socialist train.' They usually 'turn a blind eye' to new things, and even do not have the patience to read the newspaper carefully. They occasionally go out for a visit, and when they see so many strange things, they will be 'greatly surprised.' This is called 'making a fuss about nothing.'" "The third kind is war criminals who were enemies of the revolution in the past and whose fate is now in our hands." "Finally, even American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, if they have the opportunity to sneak in for a visit, will also be greatly moved. This should generally be 'panic-stricken,' considering the movement of abandoning darkness and turning to light; but there will also be individual people who are 'more deeply jealous and hateful,' trying to sabotage and react to the end." We see, this is the "dialectical materialist" analysis made by Zhang Naiqi. Which category should Committee Member Zhang Naiqi himself belong to? He certainly would not think that he is a person who "sleeps soundly" in the socialist train, nor is he a war criminal or an American and Chiang Kai-shek spy. Then, of course, he should belong to the first category. He has "a high degree of master consciousness," and "often pays attention to the development of the country and society," and "thinks one step ahead," so he does not feel that the situation is pressing, and he generally knows everything about new things, so he does not feel anything mysterious about seeing anything. Here, let us quote a passage from Chairman Mao's On Practice:

"‘The scholar who stays at home knows all the affairs of the world.’ In ancient times when technology was underdeveloped, this was just an empty phrase. In modern times when technology is developed, although this phrase can be realized, what is truly personally known are those who are practicing in the world... If you want to directly understand certain things, you can only personally participate in the struggle of transforming reality and transforming certain things in order to touch the phenomena of those things, and only by personally participating in the practice of transforming reality can the essence of those things be exposed and understood. This is the path of understanding that anyone actually takes, but some people deliberately distort it and say some opposing words. The most ridiculous people in the world are those 'knowledgeable people' who, with half-baked knowledge from hearsay, proclaim themselves 'the best in the world,' which is enough to show that they overestimate themselves."

In Zhang Naiqi's speech, haven't we seen a typical portrait of this self-proclaimed "the best in the world" "knowledgeable person"! In our view, the tree of life is evergreen, and the objective world is ultimately thousands of times richer than the subjective world. Especially in the great era of transformation where "one day equals twenty years," after the visit, seeing the leap forward of the objective world, "being greatly surprised" is exactly the common sense, and often becomes a promoting force for strengthening transformation and actively serving; but in Zhang Naiqi's view, it is instead considered "making a fuss about nothing." Isn't this a manifestation of deep hatred for singing the praises of the Great Leap Forward! Yes, there will be no one who is truly "not moved to the heart," but there are two kinds of movement. One is to see new things, be happy and excited, sing the praises of the General Line, sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward, and sing the praises of the People's Communes; the other is to be incompatible with the new society, have deeper hatred, resist transformation, and react to the end. Zhang Naiqi said that in our society, what the upper level gives to the lower level is not pressure, but should be an attraction. This is only half right. For the broad masses of the people, it is indeed an attraction, but for a few reactionary elements who resist to the end, it should be said that it is a pressure. Zhang Naiqi also believes that even American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, if they have the opportunity to visit, will also be "greatly moved." This should generally be panic-stricken, considering abandoning darkness and turning to light; only individual people will be "more deeply jealous and hateful," trying to sabotage and react to the end. It turns out that in Zhang Naiqi's view, the reason why American and Chiang Kai-shek spies and even imperialist reactionaries hate the new China is not because of their class standpoint, but only because they have no opportunity to visit. If they are allowed to sneak in for a visit, they will generally consider abandoning darkness and turning to light. This is another typical fallacy of bourgeois rightists.

Finally, Zhang Naiqi said shamelessly: He has advocated studying Chairman Mao's works for many years, "However, some people did not agree so much at that time; from my own point of view, I still did not learn enough, so I still make mistakes." How is it "not enough"? That is, I did not "take notes." "The reason why I did not learn well in the past is because I did not pay enough hard work." We see, how "beautiful" Zhang Naiqi is dressed here! He has advocated studying Chairman Mao's works many times over the years, but some people disagree. Who disagrees? He did not say. But others' disagreement will never prevent Zhang Naiqi from studying Chairman Mao's works himself. Why does this make him not learn well? What a "wonderful" logic. On the other hand, Zhang Naiqi lightly dismisses his rampant attack on the Party and socialism in 1957 with "I still make mistakes." More ridiculous is that he attributes the reason for making mistakes to not "taking notes" properly, which has nothing to do with his adherence to the bourgeois reactionary standpoint.

In short, Zhang Naiqi's entire speech on ideological issues is against ideological remolding, against the fundamental transformation of standpoint and worldview, and against promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie. This is the most naked expression of Zhang Naiqi's rightist standpoint!

(IV)

In addition to distorting the General Line of socialist construction, centrally attacking the Party's Great Leap Forward, and attacking the Party's ideological remolding policy, Zhang Naiqi's speech has many other serious errors. For example, he separated the four words of greater, faster, better, and more economical in the General Line, saying that "greater and faster are the goals, and better and more economical are the conditions"; reducing the superiority of the socialist system to just "a set of two-legged walking guidelines," and so on. What we cannot tolerate most is that he is so arrogant as to point fingers and make comments on Chairman Mao's works. As everyone knows, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was compiled after Chairman Mao personally proofread and made some individual content supplements and revisions, but Zhang Naiqi absurdly wants to add "supplements," which is an insult to our great people's leader.

In short, Zhang Naiqi's speech at the CPPCC conference is a bunch of poisonous arrows. The sharp edge of this bunch of poisonous arrows is directly aimed at the Party's General Line of socialist construction and ideological remolding policy. It can also be seen from this that if a person's standpoint is not fundamentally transformed, he will definitely stubbornly express it in political and ideological issues. Zhang Naiqi's speech at this National CPPCC Conference once again exposed his bourgeois rightist face, which should be said to be a good thing for us. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "It is not a bad thing to let anti-socialist poisonous weeds grow out of the ground in their true colors. On the contrary, it is a very good thing. Because only by doing this can we train the people's ability to identify poisonous weeds, improve the people's ability to fight against poisonous weeds, so as to achieve the goal of letting a hundred socialist flowers bloom and hoeing out anti-socialist poisonous weeds." In this sense, Zhang Naiqi's speech this time played the role of a negative teacher.

Finally, we would also like to explain our attitude. We believe that Zhang Naiqi's speech is essentially a provocative act against the Party and the General Line of socialist construction. We love the Party and the socialist cause, so we cannot but refute his fallacies. But we still hope that Zhang Naiqi can face up to his serious mistakes, reflect deeply, and be determined to transform. Going to see God with a granite head is ultimately not good for the country or for oneself.

    怎样正确认识大跃进与思想改造问题
    ——驳章乃器委员在中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议上的发言	千家驹　孙晓村　吴大琨
    最近我们出席了第二届中国人民政治协商会议第二次会议，听了李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告，感到十分兴奋和鼓舞。在大会中还听了许多委员们的发言，大家从不同的角度，不同的工作岗位来歌颂祖国社会主义建设的伟大胜利，歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，歌颂毛泽东思想的胜利，这些发言使我们受到很大的教育和启发。然而，其中有一位委员的发言，也就是章乃器委员的书面发言却与其他委员的论调根本不同。他对祖国的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和各民主党派所正要加强的政治思想改造工作作了恶意的歪曲、讽刺与攻击，引起了许多同志的愤慨。但由于他的发言，语言比较晦涩，有些不熟悉他的人可能还不容易一下子就认清他的毒素所在，所以我们特写这篇文章，一方面表达我们对祖国社会主义建设总路线、大跃进以及政治思想改造工作的体会，一方面驳斥章乃器委员的谬论。从章乃器委员的这些谬论中，我们也可以认识到，尽管我们的时代是一个不断跃进的大时代，但总有那么一小撮人，如章乃器委员一样，他们是不愿意跟着时代前进的，我们应当对这样的人保持警惕，并且同他们进行不懈的斗争。		（一）
    我们正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设持续跃进的伟大时代。在这个新的历史时期里，我们国家的经济面貌、政治面貌和社会面貌发生了前所未有的变化。毛主席关于生产力与生产关系，基础与上层建筑之间的相互关系、相互作用的精辟的论证，正在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥着巨大的指导作用。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革。”事实正是如此，我国工农业生产的不断跃进，已经促使人们的思想的不断革命，而思想的不断革命又反过来影响和加速了生产的跃进。为着适应生产力继续向上发展的要求，生产关系的各个方面随时需要进行调整，同时，建立在这种经济基础上面的上层建筑的各个方面也需要随时调整。生产力与生产关系之间，经济基础与上层建筑之间，矛盾不断地产生而又克服，克服而又产生，社会生产力就随着这样而不断前进。毛主席从来就是既反对唯心主义者否认存在决定意识，又反对机械唯物主义者只看到物而看不到人的主观能动性的。他始终坚持并且时刻运用辩证唯物主义，一方面充分估计到事物的客观规律，即充分估计到客观可能性；同时又主张充分发扬人民群众的自觉的能动性，承认社会意识对于社会存在，上层建筑对于经济基础，精神对于物质的重大的反作用。毛主席根据了生产力与生产关系，经济基础与上层建筑的相互作用的马克思列宁主义原则，把我国六亿多人民的主观能动性和社会主义经济高速度发展的客观可能性结合起来而提出了社会主义建设总路线。“鼓足干劲、力争上游，是要实行政治挂帅，根据社会主义经济发展的客观规律，充分发挥人们的主动性；多快好省，是要求在生产和建设中，尽可能地提高发展速度，充分发挥经济效果，不断地增强物质技术基础。也就是说，要把政治和经济统一起来。”（李富春）。
    这就是我们所理解的社会主义建设总路线的实质，我们认为，对于党的路线、方针、政策认真钻研，求得正确的认识，这是做好一切工作的基本条件。因此，在我们国家里，绝大多数人不仅拥护党的路线、方针、政策，许多人而且虚心学习，求得正确的理解。只有别有用心的人才会故意歪曲党的路线、方针、政策，章乃器的发言，就是对社会主义建设总路线进行歪曲、攻击的一个明显的例证。
    章乃器说：“做任何事情，只强调必要性的一面是不够的；还必须再找寻出来并且说清楚它的必然性的一面，那才算做到主观同客观的一致。”章乃器是怎样理解“必要性”和“必然性”的呢？他说：“六亿五千万人的共同愿望，看来好像只是精神的东西，只能代表必要性。它何以会构成客观规律，构成必然性呢？这里有一句大家熟知的马克思的名言：‘理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量’。但，这句话指的是‘到群众中去’的一面，而‘反映客观规律’则指的是‘从群众中来’的一面。……在这里，‘众志成城’这一句古话，是符合辩证唯物观点、也具有群众观点的。它说明：人民群众的共同愿望就变成了强大的物质力量。斯大林更明白地指出：‘世界上存在着观念的现象和物质的现象’。这种把观念的现象列为客观存在的一个方面（当然是第二性的）的说法，在经典著作中是屡见的。但对于初学唯物论的人，往往是一时不容易体会的；机械唯物论者则是永远不会理解的。”
    这里，章乃器认为六亿五千万人民要改变我国一穷二白的愿望是我国社会主义建设总路线的客观规律，既代表必要性，又构成必然性，并且引用马克思那句名言作为他理论的根据。我们认为这是对马克思主义的歪曲。不错，我们是十分重视六亿五千万人民这一伟大的生产力的，但是，六亿五千万人民的积极性，没有社会主义革命能不能发挥出来呢？显然不能。在解放以前，六亿多人民难道没有摆脱一穷二白的共同愿望吗？但在解放以前，为什么他们的共同愿望没有可能实现呢？这是因为当时还有帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山压在我们人民头上，这一种半殖民地半封建的生产关系阻碍我国生产力的发展，阻碍着我国人民群众共同愿望的实现。只有推翻了三大敌人的统治，改变了旧的生产关系，把人民群众从旧社会中解放出来，成为新社会的主人之后，人民群众才能充分发挥积极性和创造性。此其一。其次，即使在中国人民革命胜利之后，我国劳动人民已经成为新中国的主人了，但何以在1958年以前我国还是不能实现国民经济的大跃进呢？难道当时中国六亿五千万人民还没有摆脱一穷二白的强烈愿望吗，当然也不是。那么原因何在呢？这一方面固然是因为在第一个五年计划完成之前，我们还没有为我国经济的迅速发展准备了有利的物质条件，但更重要的还因为在第一个五年计划期间，对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的改造还没有完成，在生产过程中人与人真正的同志式的合作关系还没有建立起来，政治战线与思想战线上的资产阶级影响还严重存在着，而这一切都限制着劳动人民的生产积极性的发挥。只有经过了1956年经济战线上的社会主义革命，接着在1957年又进行了整风反右派斗争，在政治战线和思想战线上也取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，社会生产力和劳动人民的生产积极性才获得了空前的解放。党又及时地提出了和执行了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线。这一总路线集中地反映了我国六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况，把我国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家的强烈愿望，也确切地反映了社会主义经济的优越性和高速度发展的必然性，这样才使我国的社会主义建设出现了1958年以来的大跃进。由此可见，总路线、大跃进、人民公社不是那一个人主观上空想出来的，它是我国社会主义革命与社会主义建设的必然产物。正由于党掌握了客观发展规律，把客观规律同广大劳动人民的积极性、创造性、自觉性正确地结合起来，这才出现了轰轰烈烈的持续跃进的局面。掌握了客观规律，就使我们能够由必然的王国进入到自由的王国。没有客观规律做根据，我们的继续大跃进是不可能想像的。
    章乃器却把总路线的必要性和必然性单纯看成是六亿五千万人的共同愿望，表面上他似乎非常重视人民群众主观能动性这一重要的因素，实质上却是要否定我们的总路线是客观规律的产物。又否定了总路线是经济战线、政治思想战线上社会主义革命取得决定性胜利基础上的产物。他故意混同了客观可能性与主观能动性；故意无视社会主义革命，也就是生产关系、上层建筑对生产力、经济基础所起的作用，这样就把总路线看成是我们主观意识的产物，没有任何客观根据的。这是诬蔑我们的大跃进是“小资产阶级狂热性”的另一巧妙的说法。		（二）
    章乃器正由于对总路线作了完全唯心主义的解释，因而严重地歪曲了我们的大跃进。他在发言中有用稿子的方格子来画图的一段话，结论说：“看了图，我发现，我们的国民经济步步高升是必然的，而且越到后来越容易。但是，如果只是要求等级距地步步高升，也就是每个时期（三年或五年）按照大致相同的绝对数字发展，那仍然是懒汉思想。”那么，要怎么样才不算“懒汉思想”呢？他说，“我们的国民经济的发展，就绝不是越到后来越困难的‘人爬楼梯’，而是速度越来越大的上升中的多级火箭。我们的每一个时期（三年或五年）国民经济发展的速度就绝不会是算术级数（1、2、3、4、5、6……）而应该是几何级数（1、2、4、8、16、32……），也就是持续大跃进的速度。”照章乃器看来，只有几何级数的跃进速度，才是持续大跃进的速度。如果“只要求等级距的步步高升”，或者说用算术级数上升，那是算不得“持续跃进”的。
    在表面上来看，章乃器似乎对跃进的速度比我们任何人都要乐观，他要求我们的跃进按几何级数上升。实质上他正是要借此来否定我们当前的大跃进。因为我们究竟不是孙悟空，拔一根毫毛就可以变出几百万个孙悟空来。周总理说：“按照社会主义国家经济建设发展的速度和我国第一个五年计划的建设经验来看，应该说，工业每年增产20％以上就是跃进，增产25％以上就是大跃进，增产30％以上就是特大跃进；农业每年增产10％以上就是跃进，增产15％以上就是大跃进，增产20％以上就是特大跃进。”我们完全同意周总理这一科学的分析。周总理又说：“观察增长的速度不能只看百分比，必须同时看绝对数。如果认为工农业总产值以及每一种产品的产量，每年增长的百分数都必须高于前一年才算是跃进，那是不切实际的。”但章乃器却认为我们的发展速度必须按1、2、4、8、16、32……的几何级数上升，才算“持续跃进”，借此以达到其否定大跃进的目的。但是稍有常识的人都知道国民经济发展速度按几何级数上升是根本不可能的事情。难道章乃器真的连这一点经济常识都没有吗？联系到章乃器一贯所坚持的立场和他对社会主义的态度，他不是在实质上否定我们的大跃进又是什么呢！
    其次，我国1960年国民经济的计划是一个持续跃进的计划，同时又是一个必须经过主观努力才能完成和超额完成的计划。正因为这样，李富春副总理在报告中动员全国人民鼓足干劲发挥主观能动性来实现这一宏伟的计划。但在章乃器看来却不是这样。他说：“我们的国民经济步步高升是必然的，而且越到后来越容易。”大家知道，事实恰好相反，因为“基数大了，每增长百分之一的数值也就扩大了，完成它就需要作更大的努力”。（周总理）在我们看来认为“越到后来越需要作更大的努力”，而在章乃器委员看来却认为“越到后来越容易”。应该说，他的目的就是要松懈我们的斗志，叫我们不要作任何主观的努力。
    章乃器委员对国民经济计划所放的另一支毒箭，是对我国农业生产跃进散布悲观怀疑情绪，在第五节中他说：“同工业比较，农业生产的跃进，条件是比较苛刻的。在自然条件方面，耕地面积的扩大首先是有限度的，天灾也还不能完全避免，此外，农业机械和化学肥料的供应也还不够。因此，对于农业生产跃进的速度，不能机械地搬用工业生产的百分比。‘即使每年增产10％到20％，就已经算得是跃进了。’这是周总理在去年的‘政府工作报告’中所指出的。这番话已经预示着1958年的农业统计数字需要修订，同时也为1959年农业生产的指标的调整和今年农业生产计划的安排制定了规范。”这一段话，是藏着毒素的。首先，章乃器委员对于今年农业增产的有利条件，如已经健全发展的农村人民公社优越性日益发挥，正在开展的波澜壮阔的农业的技术革新运动为农业劳动生产率提高创造有利条件等等只字不提；相反的，他却强调了耕地面积的不能扩大，天灾的不能完全避免，以及农业机械和化学肥料的不能充分供应等等，来说明农业跃进的前景是不妙的，这已经足够荒谬的了。但最恶毒的还是他歪曲周总理去年在人代大会“政府工作报告”中说农业每年增产10％—20％就算是跃进的话，他一方面攻击我们的大跃进，是没有任何客观标准的；另一方面，居然诬蔑总理的话是为去年调整指标“预留地步”的，这不能不令我们感到十分气愤。我们知道1958年的农业产量，所以估计偏高的原因，总理在去年人大常委会上关于调整指标的报告中说得很清楚，即使调整之后，也丝毫不能动摇1958年我国农业大跃进的事实。去年粮棉指标的调整，同周总理关于农业跃进速度的话有什么关连呢？接着，章乃器又说：“此外，农业统计已经显示了综合经营的优点。1959年由于全国农村副业生产收入的猛增，就弥补了农业因为天灾严重，粮食没有完成计划的损失，使农业总产值仍然达到跃进的速度。”按李副总理在报告中明明说，粮食实际达到五千四百零一亿斤。这数字与去年调整后的指标五千五百亿斤是相差不大的（调整指标时原说增产10％左右）。由于去年我国某些地区遭受到数十年所未有的大旱灾，因而粮食完成增产8％的计划，我们从未掩饰过这一事实。即就8％的增产来说，也仍然是跃进。而章乃器却别有用心地说，由于农业统计发挥了“综合经营”的特点，我们用农村副业生产收入的猛增来弥补粮食没有完成计划之不足，这才使农业总产值仍然达到跃进的速度。我们知道，在第一个五年计划期间，我国粮食每年平均递增3.3％，而1959年，在灾情特别严重情况下，粮食仍然增产8％，这不但在资本主义国家绝对不可能，即在社会主义国家中也应该算是速度很快的。可是按照章乃器讲来，似乎我们是用把农业生产和副业生产并在一起计算的手法来使农业总产值达到跃进的速度的，这不是居心诬蔑我国去年农业生产仍然是跃进这一伟大事实，又是什么呢！		（三）
    章乃器发言的第二支毒箭是射向党的对资产阶级及其知识分子的改造政策的。这就是他发言的第六部分关于思想工作的三个问题。这一部分的文章表面上看来，特别显得晦涩费解，文理不通，逻辑混乱，不知所云。这令我们想起了过去胡风的文章来，当一个人想说的话不便于直接说出来，而又不能不曲曲折折地表达出来，就往往令人有这种感觉。
    章乃器发言的第六部分是谈思想改造问题的。按理说，谈思想改造就不能不谈到资产阶级立场与世界观同无产阶级立场与世界观这一根本性的问题，不能不谈到两条道路的斗争问题；不能不谈到如何改造资产阶级的立场与世界观的问题。但是我们大家都知道章乃器是一贯地反对资产阶级分子的根本改造的，一贯的否认资产阶级同工人阶级有本质上的区别的。在这次发言中又一次证明了他这一反动的立场丝毫也没有改变。我们看章乃器在整整一大段关于思想工作问题的发言中竟绝口不提无产阶级立场、世界观同资产阶级立场、世界观的根本性问题，而只在“形势逼人”，“有动于衷”等等上面大做文章。我们不禁要问：思想问题的实质是什么呢？如果是思想改造的话，是要把资产阶级分子改造成为工人阶级呢？还是要把工人阶级改造成为资产阶级呢？根据章乃器一贯的言论来看，这反正都是一样，资产阶级要改造，工人阶级也要改造。工人阶级有先进人物，资产阶级也有“管鲍遗风”“陶朱遗范”。由此可见，谈思想改造而不谈究竟要改造谁；改造什么；改造用什么标准等等，在我们看来，不免觉得奇怪。但按章乃器的逻辑，倒是完全可以理解的。
    其次，章乃器是一贯反对资产阶级分子的根本改造的，他认为“脱胎换骨”那就只有“至死方休”。在这次发言中证明他这一观点也是原封未动。在他的发言中，有一大段关于旧高级知识分子“思想上的框子”、“工作上的规格”、“生活上的规范”的话，他说：“工作‘规格’有的可能改动不太大，有的也不必马上改。”“‘思想上的框子’，……原来成套的只须拆开来成为个别的‘框子’，或者把个别的‘框子’再拆开来成为零件和材料，再加以适当的加工改造，就都成为有用的部件，零件和材料。问题的严重只在于构成了框子，而框子又成了套。材料是没有罪过的。分析一下我们的科学文化，分析到最后，可能大部分的材料都是‘遗产’。在伟大的时代当中，破铜、烂铁、碎砖、零木都已被搜罗一空，‘无用之材’肯定是不大有的了。”这一大段话，是很隐晦的，说得不明不白，其实，打开窗子说亮话，不过是说：“资产阶级的思想体系，工作方式，世界观等等，有的不需要改造；或者不必马上改造（如他所说的工作“规格”）；有的不必全部改造（他的所谓思想“框子”），只要不把资产阶级思想体系成套的原封不动的端出来，稍稍改头换面，修修补补就完全可以用了。”我们要大破大立，破资产阶级的立场、思想、世界观，立无产阶级的立场、思想、世界观。破得愈深也立得愈透。他却要我们改头换面，基本不动。只要把框子拆开，做适当的加工改造，就都成为“有用之材”了。这不是否认需要根本改造，又是什么？章乃器也许会问：难道资产阶级的科学中没有可用之材吗？不错，资本主义的科学、技术以及社会科学中某些素材是可以用的，我们的文化遗产中有一部分是资本主义社会遗留给我们的。但我们这里所谈的是思想改造问题，所谓思想改造问题是指资产阶级世界观的改造问题。这一问题不解决，就根本谈不上材料有没有用，以及为社会主义服务的积极性。章乃器所说的“思想上的框子”，“工作上的规格”，“生活的规范”都是属于资产阶级的思想、工作方法、生活方式问题。他所要全部或基本上保留的东西，正是我们必须以全力摧毁的东西。
    其三，许多知识分子，感觉到形势逼人，非加强改造不可，这在我们看来，本是一件大好的事情。但在章乃器看来，恰恰相反，他认为不感到形势逼人才是好事，他说，“不感觉到形势逼人，也没有什么神秘。一种方法，是经常掌握客观形势的发展，思想先行一步，生活如果太高，准备暂时（不过是暂时的）后退一两步。……另一种……就是完全信任伟大的毛泽东时代，……把自己放到客观形势的当中去，成为形势的一个组成分子。那就根本不会发生什么逼不逼的问题。”大概章乃器认为他自己是“经常掌握客观形势的发展”，而“思想先行一步”的吧，所以他是不会感到形势逼人的。在我们看来，客观世界是不能不影响主观世界的，而当主观世界认识了客观世界的规律性以后，又会反过来影响客观世界。有没有不受客观世界影响的人呢？那就只有花岗石头脑了。至于章乃器委员所说的“完全信任伟大的毛泽东时代，把自己放到客观形势中去”，实质上是放任自流，不要发挥改造的自觉性与主观能动性的另一说法而已。
    其四，关于参观访问的“有动于衷”与“无动于衷”的问题。许多同志通过了参观访问，也就是通过了社会实践，提高了自己的认识，更热爱社会主义和我们的领袖毛主席，更认识到总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的绝对正确性，这次许多委员的发言中都有这种体会，这在我们看来，也是一件加强自我改造的大好事。但是章乃器怎么看待这一问题的呢？他说，“正确的方法是肯定‘凡人皆动’，然后再分析种种不同的动的现象和本质。”于是他把“有动于衷”的人分成四类：“一种是有高度的主人翁自觉的人们，他们经常注视着国家和社会的发展，对于一切新生事物都心中大致了了。……这种人的动是最正常的，也是最普遍的”。“第二种是在‘社会主义列车’当中‘睡大觉’的人们。他们平时对新事物‘熟视无睹’，甚至连报纸都没有耐心去好好地读一遍。他们偶尔出去参观一次，看到那么多陌生的事物，便要‘大吃一惊’。这叫做‘少见多怪’。”“第三种是过去与革命为敌而现在自己的命运掌握在我们的手里的战犯们。”“最后，甚至连美蒋的间谍，假如他们有机会潜入参观的话，也要大动特动。这一般地应该是‘惊惶失措’，考虑弃暗投明的动；但也会有个别的‘妒恨更深’，力图破坏，反动到底的。”我们看，这就是章乃器所作的“辩证唯物主义”的分析。章乃器委员自己应该属于那一类呢？他当然不会认为自己是在社会主义列车中“睡大觉”的人，又不是战犯和美蒋间谍，那么，他当然是应该属于第一类的了，他既“有高度的主人翁自觉感”，又“经常注视国家和社会的发展”，而且“思想先行一步”，所以既不感觉到形势逼人，又对一切新生事物都心中大致了了，所以看什么也没有什么神秘的感觉。这里，让我们引毛主席在实践论中说的一段话：
    “‘秀才不出门，全知天下事’，在技术不发达的古代只是一句空话，在技术发达的现代虽然可以实现这句话，然而真正亲知的是天下实践着的人……。如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。这是任何人实际上走着的认识路程，不过有些人故意歪曲地说些反对的话罢了。世界上最可笑的是那些‘知识里手’，有了道听途说的一知半解，便自封为‘天下第一’，适足见其不自量而已。”
    在章乃器发言中，我们不是看到这种自封为“天下第一”的“知识里手”的典型的画像了吗！在我们看来，生活之树是常青的，客观世界终是比主观世界丰富到千万倍，尤其是在“一天等于二十年”的伟大的变革的时代里，在参观之后，看到客观世界的飞跃前进，“大吃一惊”，正是情理之常，而且常常成为加强改造，积极服务的促进力量；而在章乃器看来，却反而认为是“少见多怪”，这不是对歌颂大跃进的刻骨仇恨的表现吗！不错，真正
  “无动于中”的人是不会有的，不过动有两种，一种是看了新鲜事物，欢欣鼓舞，歌颂总路线，歌颂大跃进，歌颂人民公社；一种是对新社会格格不入，仇恨更深，抗拒改造，反动到底。章乃器说，在我们的社会里，上层给下层的，不是什么压力，而应该是一种引力。这话只说对了一半，对广大人民群众说的确是一种引力，但对少数顽抗到底的反动分子说则应该说是一种压力。章乃器又认为甚至美蒋间谍，假如有机会参观的话，也要“大动特动”的，这一般地应该惊慌失措，考虑弃暗投明；只有个别的会“妒恨更深”，力图破坏，反动到底。原来在章乃器看来，美蒋间谍以至帝国主义反动派之所以仇视新中国，并不是由于他们阶级立场，而只是由于他们没有机会参观访问，如果让他们潜入参观的话，他们一般就会考虑弃暗投明。这又是典型的资产阶级右派的谬论。
    最后，章乃器还大言不惭地说：他在多年以来，就主张学习毛主席著作，“可是，当时却有人并不那么同意；从我自己来说，也仍然学得很不够，所以还会犯错误。”怎么样“不够”呢，就是没有“做笔记”，“以往之所以没有学好，就因为没有支付足够的辛勤劳动。”我们看，章乃器这里把自己打扮得多么“漂亮”啊！他多年以来就多次主张学习毛主席著作，可是却有人不同意，谁不同意呢，他没有说。但别人不同意也决不会妨碍章乃器自己学习毛主席著作呵，为什么这就会使他没有学好呢，真是“奇妙”的逻辑。另一方面，章乃器又把自己在1957年对党对社会主义的猖狂进攻，轻轻以
  “还会犯错误”，一笔带过。更滑稽的是他把犯错误的原因归之于未好好“做笔记”，而与他的坚持资产阶级反动立场丝毫无关的。
    总之，章乃器关于思想问题的整个发言是反对思想改造，反对立场与世界观的根本改造，反对兴无灭资的。这是章乃器右派立场最露骨的表现！
    （四）
    章乃器发言中除了歪曲社会主义建设总路线，集中地攻击党的大跃进，攻击党的思想改造政策外，其他严重的错误还是很多的。举例来说，如他把总路线中的多、快、好、省四字割裂开来，说“多快是目的，而好省是条件”；把社会主义制度的优越性降低为就是“一套两条腿走路的方针”等等，不一而足。最令我们不能容忍的是他竟狂妄到对毛主席的著作指手划脚，评头论足。大家知道，“毛泽东选集”是经过毛主席亲自校阅作了些个别的内容上的补充与修改而编成的，而章乃器竟荒谬地要加以“补充”，这是对我们伟大的人民领袖的一种侮辱。
    总之，章乃器在政协大会上的发言是一束毒箭，这束毒箭的锋芒是直接射向党的社会主义建设总路线和思想改造政策的。从这里也可以看出，一个人的立场如果不作根本的改造，他一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，顽强地表现出来。章乃器在这次全国政协大会的发言再一次暴露了他的资产阶级右派的面目，对我们来说，应该说是一件好事。正如刘少奇主席说：“让反社会主义的毒草以本来面目长出地面，并不是坏事，相反地，是很好的事。因为只有这样做，才能锻炼人民群众识别毒草的能力，提高人民群众同毒草作斗争的本领，从而达到放社会主义百花，锄反社会主义毒草的目的。”就这一点来说，章乃器这次的发言，是起了反面教员的作用的。
    最后，我们还要说明一下我们的态度，我们认为章乃器的发言实质上是对党、对社会主义建设总路线的一种挑衅行为。我们热爱党，热爱社会主义事业，所以不能不对他的谬论进行驳斥。但我们仍希望章乃器能够正视自己的严重错误，痛切反省，决心改造。带着花岗石头脑去见上帝，究竟对国家，对自己都是没有好处的。
