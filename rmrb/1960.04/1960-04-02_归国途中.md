    On the Way Home
    Lu Xing
    In the Port of Jakarta
    In the distant port of Jakarta,
    On the scorching equator,
    The heavy anchor chain is dragged from the seabed,
    The ship from the motherland is about to set sail.
    The deck is filled with people,
    Cheers overwhelm the roaring waves,
    Tears glisten in the eyes of the elderly,
    Children are waving—towards the distant north…
    The cheers gradually subside,
    The wildly beating hearts have already flown out of their chests,
    Some are tidying up their luggage,
    Others are leaning on the railing, gazing into the distance.
    An old man with snow-white hair,
    Is deep in thought, head bowed,
    The child beside him has asked countless times:
    "Grandpa, how many rivers and hills are there in our hometown?"
    The slow footsteps of the clock,
    Finally come to the end of this unbearable time,
    The loud whistle interrupts people's reverie,
    The deck is once again seething with waves of joy.
    Someone starts humming softly:
    "Motherland, my dear mother..."
    This song immediately turns into a surging torrent,
    Rushing towards the distant horizon where the sky and water meet...
    Secret
    In a simple hotel abroad,
    I met a friend I hadn't seen for many years,
    He was hunched over a wooden table, writing a letter in haste,
    And then quickly mailed the written letter.
    "Perhaps it's still lying in a mailbag, traveling abroad,
    When you've already set foot on the land of the motherland."
    But my friend told me this secret with a smile:
    "Just to let it carry this heart away sooner."
    Dream
    Dark clouds cover the moon,
    A fierce wind brings raging waves,
    The swaying lights in the cabin,
    Shine on every rocking hammock.
    The large light bulb is like a ripe orange,
    Hanging from the ceiling of the cabin.
    People are all quietly asleep,
    As if there were no storms on the sea.
    Snow-white pillows,
    Smiling faces,
    As if there were no storms on the sea,
    They have all fallen deeply into dreamland.
    Everyone on the ship is having the same dream:
    Dreaming of returning to the time when they were infants,
    A gentle lullaby lingers in their ears,
    A loving mother gently rocks the cradle...

    归国途中
    鲁行
    在雅加达港口
    在遥远的雅加达港口，
    在炎热的赤道线上，
    沉重的锚链从海底拖起，
    来自祖国的海轮就要启航。
    甲板上站满了人群，
    欢呼声压倒了叫啸的海浪，
    老人们的眼睛泪光晶莹，
    小孩子在招手——向着辽远的北方……
    欢呼声渐渐静息，
    狂跳的心呵早已飞出胸腔，
    有的在整理随身携带的箱笼，
    有的依着船栏向远处眺望。
    一位须发全白的老人，
    低着头在沉思默想，
    身边的孩子不知问了多少遍：
    “爷爷，家乡有几条水，几座  山岗？”
    时钟的缓慢的脚步，
    终于走完了这难熬的时光，
    高吭的汽笛打断了人们的沉思，
    甲板上重又沸腾起欢乐的波浪。
    不知谁低低地哼起：
    “祖国呵，我的亲娘……”
    这歌声立刻变成了汹涌的巨流，
    一直奔向水天合抱的远方……
    秘密
    在国外一家简陋的旅店里，
    我遇见一位多年不见的朋友，
    他伏在板桌上匆匆写信，
    又把写好的信匆匆投邮。
    “也许它还躺在邮包中在国外旅行，
    当你已经踏上祖国土地的时候。”
    友人却微笑着告诉我这个秘密：
    “只为了让它把这颗心儿早些捎走。”
    梦
    乌云掩盖了月亮，
    狂风赶来了恶浪，
    舱里摇晃的灯光，
    照着每一张摇摆的吊床。
    硕大的灯泡像是熟透的橙子，
    悬挂在卧舱的天花板上。
    人们都已静静地入睡，
    仿佛大海上并没有风浪。
    一只只雪白的床枕，
    一张张微笑的面庞，
    仿佛大海上并没有风浪，
    他们已沉沉地走入梦乡。
    全船的人都做着同一个梦：
    梦见自己重又回到婴孩的时光，
    温柔的摇篮曲萦绕在耳畔，
    慈爱的母亲把摇篮轻轻摇晃……
