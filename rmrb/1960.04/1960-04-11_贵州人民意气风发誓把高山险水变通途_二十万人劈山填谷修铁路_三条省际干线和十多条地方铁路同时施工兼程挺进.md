　　 本报贵阳10日电　Guizhou, April 10th (report from our newspaper) A railway construction upsurge of unprecedented scale has been launched in the Guizhou Plateau, with three inter-provincial trunk lines and more than ten local railways under construction simultaneously. Under the leadership of the Party, nearly 200,000 people are determined to make "steel dragons" dance among the mountains in a relatively short period of time, changing the backward situation of traffic congestion in the mountainous areas.

　　This year, the scale of railway construction in Guizhou Province exceeds any previous year. The funds used for railway construction in the first half of the year account for about one-third of the total basic construction investment in the province, doubling the amount in the same period last year. The province continues to build and newly start the construction of three railway trunk lines: the 306-kilometer-long Sichuan-Guizhou line, and the Guizhou section of the Yunnan-Guizhou line connecting Yunnan Province in the southwest border of the motherland, have entered a stage of intense construction; the Guizhou section of the Hunan-Guizhou line has also fully started construction. The total length of these three trunk lines is more than 800 kilometers. At the same time, various localities have also built a number of railway branch lines and dedicated lines in key industrial and mining areas. Fourteen lines have already started construction, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers; another nine lines are being actively prepared and will be under construction soon. The vast majority of these branch lines and dedicated lines are connected to the main trunk lines in the province.

　　The starting point or the end point of the newly built railways in Guizhou Province this year, especially the three trunk lines of Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou and Hunan-Guizhou, are connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou, Chengdu-Chongqing and other trunk lines that constitute the national railway system. In this way, the remote mountainous areas of Guizhou can be closely linked with all parts of the country. The grain and economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco, tung oil, and medicinal materials produced in Guizhou can be sold throughout the country; a large number of industrial products from all over the country can also be transported into Guizhou. In particular, the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway also makes the railway in our country form a circular whole, which is of great significance for accelerating the material exchange in various parts of the country and overcoming the unreasonable phenomenon of material backflow in transportation.

　　Guizhou is a province with overlapping mountains and crisscrossing streams and rivers. The railways to be built, whether trunk lines or branch lines, must fight against high mountains and dangerous waters. In particular, most parts of Guizhou Province are limestone areas, with many faults, caves, and underground water. Some places are algae-covered areas. Therefore, road construction is even more difficult. The western section of the Hunan-Guizhou line, which started construction in February this year, is only 259 kilometers long, but the amount of earth and stone to be excavated and filled is more than 54 million cubic meters, with an average of more than 200,000 cubic meters per kilometer. The entire section also needs to build 68 bridges and 102 tunnels, with a total length of more than 42 kilometers. Among them, the Yongxi section is the most complicated. The entire section is only more than ten kilometers long, but there are 11 large and medium-sized bridges and 17 tunnels to be built, as well as two key earth and stone projects. The length of bridges and tunnels alone accounts for about half of the total length of this section. The Yunnan-Guizhou Railway, which stretches in the high and cold mountainous area of ​​northwest, is the same, with caves, faults, and underground water. For example, the Yanjiao Tunnel, which is 2,713 meters long, has to pass through ten coal seams, with caves, underground water, and gas, and is called the "water and fire cave." Despite the arduousness of the line project, the railway construction reflects the urgent wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province. They eat in the wind and sleep in the dew, work day and night, exert a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and launch a tenacious struggle with high mountains and dangerous waters. Their slogan is: Not afraid of river waves, not afraid of Miao Mountains and Lou Mountains higher than the sky, we wield the mountain-splitting axe, and we will surely turn high mountains and dangerous waters into plains.

　　In order to speed up the construction progress, the workers launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on rapid construction. The railway soldiers and migrant workers who built the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway have successively proposed and implemented more than 17,000 innovation proposals. The tunnel construction of the entire line has broken through the 100-meter mark per month due to the widespread adoption of advanced construction methods and advanced construction tools; the heroes of the Yanjiao Tunnel are often threatened by gas and underground water, but they all practice hard work and ingenuity, and also created a record of 190 meters per month. The workers fighting on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line, after realizing the construction of small machines, continued to make revolution and improve the small machines, organized them according to local conditions, and formed a joint operation line for excavation, loading, transportation, and filling. The work efficiency has been significantly improved. Compared with the same period last year, basically one person's work can match several people's.

　　In order to further accelerate the railway construction of the province, recently each line has established a construction site party committee under the leadership of the local party committee. Under the guidance of the policy of the whole party and the whole people running the railway, the party committees of each construction site have incorporated the manpower and material resources needed for railway construction into the local construction plan for unified arrangement and deployment. In this way, railway construction and various production can achieve a leap forward together. Under the unified arrangement of the party committee of the construction site, the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway quickly mobilized more than 30,000 commune members to participate in road construction. In addition to ensuring sufficient labor for line construction, the party committee of the Hunan-Guizhou line construction site also made comprehensive arrangements for the tools and vegetable supply needed for railway construction, so the construction of this line is progressing very smoothly.

    贵州人民意气风发誓把高山险水变通途
    二十万人劈山填谷修铁路
    三条省际干线和十多条地方铁路同时施工兼程挺进
    本报贵阳10日电　贵州高原掀起了规模空前的铁路建设高潮，三条省际干线和十多条地方铁路同时施工。近二十万人在党的领导下，决心在较短的时间内，叫“钢龙”飞舞万山之间，改变山区交通阻塞的落后面貌。
    今年，贵州省铁路建设规模超过以往任何一年。上半年用于铁路建设的资金，约占全省基本建设投资总额的三分之一，比去年同期增加一倍。全省继续修建和新开工修建的铁路干线共有三条：长达三百零六公里的川黔线、连接祖国西南边陲云南省的滇黔线贵州境内段，已进入紧张施工阶段；湘黔线贵州段也已全面动工。这三条干线总长八百多公里。与此同时，各地还在重点厂矿地区新建了一批铁路支线和专用线。现在已经动工的有十四条，总长三百多公里；另有九条线路正在积极准备，即将施工。这些支线和专用线绝大部分和省内主要干线衔接。
    今年贵州省新建的铁路特别是川黔、滇黔和湘黔三条干线，起点或终点都是和构成全国铁路体系的京广、成渝等干线连接。这样，就可使地处边远的贵州山区，紧密地和全国各地联系起来。贵州盛产的粮食和烤烟、桐油、药材等经济作物，就能因此畅销全国；全国各地的大批工业用品，也能源源运进贵州。特别是川黔铁路的建设，还使我国铁路构成一个循环整体，这对加速全国各地的物资交流和克服运输上物资倒流的不合理现象有着很重大的意义。
    贵州境内山峦重叠，溪河纵横，要修建的铁路，不管是干线和支线，都要同高山险水作斗争。特别是贵州省各地多是石灰岩，断层、溶洞、地下水较多，有的地方还是藻面地带，因此，修路工程就更加艰巨。今年2月动工修建的湘黔线西段，全长只有二百五十九公里，但是要挖填的土石方就有五千四百多万立方米，平均每公里在二十万立方米以上，全段还要修建六十八座桥、一百零二座隧道，桥梁和隧道总长四十二公里多。其中涌溪一段的工程最为复杂，全段只有十多公里，但要修建的大中桥就有十一座、隧道十七座，还有两个重点土石方工程，仅桥梁和隧道的长度就约占这段线路总长度的一半。伸展在西北高寒山区的滇黔铁路也是一样，溶洞、断层、地下水等样样俱全。如全长二千七百一十三米的岩脚隧道，要通过十层煤层，有溶洞、地下水，还有瓦斯，被人们称为“水火洞。”尽管线路工程如此艰巨，但是由于铁路建设集中反映了贵州省各族人民的迫切愿望，他们都风餐露宿，披星戴月，发挥了高度的劳动热情，和高山险水展开了顽强的斗争。他们的口号是：不怕河水波浪翻，不怕苗岭娄山高过天，咱们挥动开山爿，定叫高山险水变平川。
    为了加快施工进度，职工们掀起了一个以快速施工为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。修建滇黔铁路的铁道兵和民工们，先后提出并实现的革新建议有一万七千多件。全线的隧道施工由于广泛采用了先进的施工方法和先进的施工工具，月成洞都突破一百米关；岩脚隧道的英雄们虽然经常遭到瓦斯和地下水的胁击，但他们个个实行了苦干和巧干，还创造了月成洞一百九十米的纪录。战斗在川黔铁路线上的职工，在实现小型机具施工后，不断革命，又把小型机具加以改进，因地制宜地组织起来，使挖、装、运、填等工序形成一个联动作业线，工效显著提高，与去年同期比较，基本上做到了一人干活顶数人。
    为了进一步加快全省的铁路建设，最近各条线路都在当地党委的领导下，建立了工地党委。各工地党委在全党全民办铁路的方针指导下，都把铁路建设所需要的人力、物力纳入地方建设计划，进行统一安排和部署。这样，就使铁路建设和各项生产得到齐头跃进。滇黔铁路在工地党委的统一安排下，很快就调集了三万多名社员参加筑路。湘黔线工地党委除了保证线路建设有足够的劳力外，还对铁路建设所需要的工具、蔬菜供应等问题，进行了全面的安排，因而使这条线路的建设进行得很顺利。（附图片）
