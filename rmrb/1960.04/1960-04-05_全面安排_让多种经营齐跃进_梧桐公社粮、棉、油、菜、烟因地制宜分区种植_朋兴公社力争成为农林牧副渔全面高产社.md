    Comprehensive Arrangements to Achieve a Leap Forward in Diversified Operations
    Wutong Commune Plants Grain, Cotton, Oil, Vegetables, and Tobacco in Designated Zones Based on Local Conditions
    Pengxing Commune Strives to Become a Comprehensive High-Yield Commune for Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fisheries
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Wutong People's Commune in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, takes grain as the key and comprehensively arranges various crops in a planned way, implementing zoned and centralized planting of crops based on local conditions. This not only ensures a greater increase in grain production but also guarantees the expansion of planting areas for cash crops such as cotton, vegetables, tobacco, and oil crops; it ensures the development of the commune’s self-sufficiency production and also guarantees the improvement of commodity production.
    The Wutong People's Commune has fertile land and abundant underground water sources, making it very suitable for planting grain and other cash crops. Recently, when the commune's Party committee and various management districts jointly studied and arranged the planting area of various crops for this year, they found that some cadres and commune members did not fully understand the significance of the principle of taking grain as the key and developing diversified operations, nor did they understand the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. They had the idea of planting whatever they eat, starting solely from meeting the needs of their own unit, and were unable to arrange the planting ratio of various crops according to the needs of the state. Based on the masses’ demands for developing production, the commune's Party committee held discussions with experienced farmers, fully utilized the superior conditions of the People's Commune ("large in size and collective in nature"), and comprehensively arranged various crops in a planned, focused, and localized manner. The specific approach is: taking the ten management districts, including Wutong, which have flat land, abundant underground water sources, and have historically achieved bumper harvests of grain and vegetables, as the grain and vegetable operation area, concentrating efforts to manage 26,000 mu of grain crops and 5,000 mu of vegetables well; taking the thirteen management districts, including Qianying, where the masses have rich experience in tobacco planting techniques, as the tobacco operation area, using the main force to plant 13,000 mu of tobacco well; taking the ten management districts, including Xiazha, with better water conservancy conditions, as the cotton and oil operation area, using the main force to manage 11,000 mu of cotton and 3,000 mu of oil crops well. The other fifteen management districts have high and steep land, making them very suitable for the development of forestry and animal husbandry, so they are designated as forestry and animal husbandry operation areas. However, these management districts currently still focus on grain cultivation, and will gradually implement returning farmland to forests and pastures as forestry and animal husbandry develop.
    The commune's Party committee also determined that the grain and vegetable operation areas should use small non-arable land to plant oil crops to meet the needs of commune members for edible oil; the tobacco and cotton/oil operation areas, in addition to using scattered vacant land to plant a large number of oil crops, each commune member is allowed to have an average of half a mu of vegetable garden and about two mu of grain fields to ensure that commune members have sufficient edible oil, grain, and vegetables. In this way, these management districts will not only become bases for providing the state with a large amount of commodity grain, cotton, oil, vegetables, and tobacco, but also ensure the continuous improvement and enhancement of commune members' lives. After the whole commune implemented zoned and centralized planting of crops, the sown area of grain crops in the whole commune this year accounted for 74.3% of the total sown area, the cotton sown area accounted for 9.09% of the total sown area, and the tobacco sown area accounted for 6.6% of the total sown area; the oil crop sown area accounted for 2.48% of the total sown area; the vegetable sown area accounted for more than 4.1%; and other crops such as sugar beets, melons, and medicinal herbs accounted for 3.32% of the total sown area. Among them, the vegetable planting area has expanded by more than 1.1 times compared with last year, the tobacco planting area has expanded by 17 times compared with last year; the oil crop planting area has expanded by 17% compared with last year, and the planting area of other crops such as sugar beets and medicinal herbs has expanded by more than 1.7 times compared with last year. This comprehensive arrangement and rational layout not only enabled various crops to be planted in accordance with local conditions, but also ensured the comprehensive completion of the state's planting plan. It is estimated that the total agricultural production income of the whole commune this year can increase by more than 1.5 times compared with last year, and the various agricultural products provided to the state will increase by half or double.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th) The Pengxing People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, is seizing the key opportunity of spring planting, continuing to implement the principle of taking grain as the key and comprehensively arranging diversified operations, striving to develop the production of various crops and diversified operations in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries based on local conditions, and striving to lay the foundation for exceeding the doubling of the total agricultural output value and grain output of the whole commune this year.
    The Pengxing Commune is located in a plain area with lakes and hills, which is suitable for diversified operations. However, before the realization of the people's commune, it was known for its high rice yield, with few other crops planted and few diversified operation resources developed. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the establishment of the people's commune, the difficulties of the small size and weak strength of the original agricultural cooperatives have been overcome, and diversified operations have developed significantly. This year, based on the principle of taking grain as the key and developing comprehensively, the commune put forward a more ambitious slogan: to turn the high-yield rice commune into a comprehensive high-yield commune, to achieve high yields in all crops, and to achieve bumper harvests in all diversified operations. Based on the experience of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the commune also realized that a considerable part of the crops are sown during the spring planting period, and the spring planting period is also a good time for animal husbandry's spring mating and hatching, fisheries' fry catching and hatching, and forestry's afforestation and seedling cultivation. Therefore, the spring planting period is a key season for implementing the comprehensive development with grain as the key throughout the year. Accordingly, the commune has taken a series of strong measures from the beginning of spring plowing and spring planting this year to comprehensively strengthen the production of various crops and diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    Under the condition of ensuring increased grain production, adopting measures such as reclaiming wasteland, increasing multiple cropping, and adjusting crop layout to expand and rationally arrange the sown area of various crops is the key measure for the Pengxing Commune to ensure the comprehensive development of planting. Now, commune members are sowing on more than 5,000 mu of newly reclaimed lake wasteland this year, and spring planting fields such as intercropping corn with soybeans and intercropping cotton in wheat fields have been plowed and prepared. In addition, the commune also implemented the method of planting feed crops, fruit trees, and vegetables on the slopes and by the lakes, freeing up thousands of mu of land suitable for growing grain crops to expand the planting of spring-sown grain crops. As a result, compared with last year, all kinds of spring-sown crops that have been sown and are being prepared for sowing have been expanded: early and mid-season rice has expanded by more than 10%, cotton has expanded by 11%, soybeans have expanded by more than half, and vegetables have expanded by three to four times. In previous years, the cotton, soybeans, and other crops of the commune were always planted in fields with poor soil and water sources, and the plots were scattered, resulting in low yields. This year, all teams have arranged these crops to be planted in fields with better water sources and soil quality, and nearly 10,000 mu of cotton and soybean fields in the commune are mostly irrigated, and scattered planting is changed to continuous planting as much as possible to facilitate management.
    While grasping the spring planting of crops, the commune also vigorously grasps the "spring planting" of diversified operations such as livestock spring mating, poultry spring hatching, fry catching, artificial fish fry hatching, and afforestation and seedling cultivation. At present, the commune has basically achieved full mating and pregnancy for sows of appropriate age, and the conception rate of large livestock is rising in a straight line; the first batch of more than 30,000 seed eggs placed on the kang has begun to hatch; the parent fish raised in the three fish farms of the commune are four times more than last year and are currently laying eggs and hatching; the fry catching experts who catch fish fry in the Yangtze River have already set off; and the greening troops have planted more than 100,000 saplings. All these "spring planting" activities are done earlier and better than last year.
    Having specialized teams for each crop and each operation is another important measure for the Pengxing Commune to ensure comprehensive development. In spring planting, the production teams of the commune have tapped labor potential, reduced logistics personnel, and strengthened the front line of production. While equipping the grain crop specialized team with strong labor and more tools, they have also increased the labor allocation to the specialized teams for various crops and various operations. At present, the labor force engaged in cash crop, vegetable cultivation, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries production in each production team has generally increased by one times compared with the same period last year.
    The Pengxing Commune also adopts the method of helping poor teams to engage in more diversified operations to promote the comprehensive development of production in various teams. During the spring planting, the commune specially helped 20 poor teams plant more cash-generating crops such as cotton, sugarcane, vegetables, and fruits, and allocated 50,000 yuan of investment to help these teams comprehensively develop production, especially the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Now, the production progress of these poor teams has basically caught up with the level of general teams.

    全面安排　让多种经营齐跃进
    梧桐公社粮、棉、油、菜、烟因地制宜分区种植
    朋兴公社力争成为农林牧副渔全面高产社
    本报讯　山西省介休县梧桐人民公社，以粮为纲，有计划地全面安排各种农作物，因地制宜地实行作物分区集中种植，这就既可保证粮食有更多的增产，又可保证棉花、蔬菜、烟叶、油料等经济作物种植面积的扩大；既可保证全社自给性生产的发展，又可保证商品性生产的提高。
    梧桐人民公社土地肥沃，地下水源丰富，很适宜种植粮食和其他经济作物。公社党委根据以粮为纲发展多种经营的方针，最近和各管理区共同研究安排今年各种作物种植面积的时候，发现有些干部和社员对这个方针的意义和国家、集体、个人利益的关系认识不足，存在有吃啥种啥的思想，单纯从满足本单位的需要出发，不能根据国家的需要来安排各种作物的种植比例。公社党委根据群众发展生产的要求，和老农进行了座谈，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越条件，有计划、有重点、因地制宜地全面安排了各种农作物。具体做法是：以土地平坦，地下水源丰富，历年来粮食、蔬菜都获得丰收的梧桐等十个管理区为粮食蔬菜经营区，集中力量经营好二万六千亩粮食作物和五千亩蔬菜；以群众富有植烟技术经验的前营等十三个管理区为烟叶经营区，用主要力量种植好一万三千亩烟叶；以水利条件较好的下栅等十个管理区为棉油经营区，用主要力量经营好一万一千亩棉花和三千亩油料作物。其他十五个管理区地高坡陡，很适宜林牧业的发展，因此确定为林牧经营区。但这些管理区当前仍以经营粮食为主，以后随着林牧业的发展，逐年实行退耕还林还牧。
    公社党委还确定粮菜经营区利用小块非耕地种植油料作物，满足社员吃油的需要；烟叶和棉油两个经营区除利用零散的空闲土地大量种植油料作物外，每个社员平均都留有半分菜地和二亩左右的粮田，保证社员有充足的食油、粮食和蔬菜。这样，今后这些管理区既成为给国家提供大量商品粮、棉、油、菜和烟叶的基地，又保证了社员生活不断的改善和提高。全公社实行作物分区集中种植以后，使今年全社粮食作物的播种面积占到总播种面积的74.3％，棉花播种面积占到总播种面积的9.09％，烟叶播种面积占到总播种面积的6.6％；油料播种面积占到总播种面积的2.48％；蔬菜播种面积占到总播种面积的4.1％多；其他甜菜、瓜类、药材等作物占到总播种面积的3.32％。其中蔬菜种植面积比去年扩大了一点一倍多，烟叶的种植面积比去年扩大了十七倍；油料作物的种植面积比去年扩大了17％，其他甜菜、药材等的种植面积比去年扩大了一点七倍多。这样全面安排合理布局的结果，不仅使各种作物做到了因地制宜地种植，并保证了国家播种计划的全面完成。预计今年全社农业生产的总收入可比去年增加一点五倍多，为国家提供的各种农产品将半倍或成倍地增长。
    据新华社武汉4日电　湖北孝感县朋兴人民公社抓紧春播关键时机，继续贯彻以粮为纲全面安排多种经营的方针，因地制宜努力发展各项农作物生产和林、牧、副、渔多种经营，力争为超额实现全社今年农业总产值和粮食产量双双翻番打下基础。
    朋兴公社地处平原，有湖泊，也有丘陵，适宜多种经营，但在实现人民公社化以前，这里以水稻高产著称，其他农作物种得少，多种经营的资源也开发不多。大跃进以来，特别是人民公社成立后，克服了原先农业社时期社小力薄的困难，多种经营有了显著发展。今年这个社根据以粮为纲全面发展的方针，提出了更加雄伟的口号：要把水稻高产社变成全面高产社，要农作物项项高产，要多种经营业业丰收。根据两年大跃进的经验，这个社还认识到：全年有相当大一部分农作物在春播期下种，而春播期间又是牧业春配春孵、渔业捕捞鱼苗、孵化鱼苗和林业造林育苗的大好时机，因此春播期间是全年贯彻以粮为纲全面发展的关键季节。据此，这个社今年春耕春播一开始就采取了一系列有力措施，全面加强各项农作物的生产和林、牧、副、渔等多种经营。
    在保证粮食增产的条件下，采用垦荒、增加复种、调整作物布局等办法，扩大和合理安排各项农作物的播种面积，这是朋兴公社保证种植业全面发展的关键措施。现在，这个社的社员正在今年新垦的五千多亩湖荒上播种，玉米套种大豆、麦田间作棉花等套种间作的春播田已经耕好整好。另外，全社还实行了饲料作物、果树、蔬菜上坡下湖的办法，腾出了上千亩宜种粮食作物的田地扩种春播粮食作物。这样一来，目前已经播种和准备播种的各项春播作物，和去年比较，项项都有扩大：早、中稻扩大10％多，棉花扩大11％，大豆扩大一半以上，蔬菜扩大了三、四倍。往年这个社的棉花、大豆等作物历来都是种在土质、水源较差的田里，地块分散，产量较低，今年各队都把这些作物安排种在水源、土质较好的田里，全社近万亩棉花、大豆田大都是水浇地，并且尽量改零星种植为连片种植，方便管理。
    在抓紧农作物春播的同时，全社还大抓家畜春配、家禽春孵、捕捞鱼苗、人工孵化鱼苗以及造林育苗等多种经营的“春播”工作。目前，全社适龄母猪已基本实现全配满怀，大家畜配种怀胎率正直线上升；第一批上炕的三万多个种蛋已开始破壳出雏；全社三个渔场养殖的亲鱼，比去年多了四倍，目前正产卵孵化，在长江捕捞鱼苗的捕捞能手已经出发；各绿化大军已经栽活了幼树十多万棵。所有这些“春播”活动都比去年作得又早又好。
    项项作物、项项经营有专业队，是朋兴公社保证全面发展的另一个重要措施。这个公社的各生产队在春播中都大挖劳动潜力，缩减后勤人员，加强生产第一线，在给粮食作物专业队配备较强劳力和较多工具的同时，还给各项作物和各项经营的专业队增拨了劳力。目前，各生产队从事经济作物、蔬菜栽培和林、牧、副、渔生产的劳力一般都比去年同期增加了一倍。
    朋兴公社还采取扶助穷队多搞多种经营的办法，促进各队生产全面发展。这个社在春播中特地帮助二十个穷队种了较多的棉花、甘蔗、蔬菜、水果等收益较大的作物，并拨出五万元投资，帮助这些队全面发展生产，特别是发展林、牧、副、渔的生产，现在，这些穷队的各项生产进度已基本上赶上了一般队的水平。
