He said, "The development of the national economy of any Asian or African country is itself an encouragement and support for other countries. It is in this spirit that the Chinese people are strengthening economic cooperation with Asian and African countries." Premier Zhou's speech was greeted with warm applause.

Singh, Chairman of the Upper House of the Nepalese Parliament, said in welcoming Premier Zhou that Premier Zhou's friendly expressions had created a pleasant atmosphere in the hearts of the Nepalese people.

    在这以后，加德满都市政委员会主席布腊亚加·拉杰·辛格送给贵宾一尊象征和平的释迦牟尼佛像和尼泊尔的民族帽子。
    这次显示中尼友谊的大会在暴风雨般地高呼“中国人和尼泊尔人是兄弟”、“世界和平万岁”等口号声中结束。
    尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊、尼泊尔政府其他高级官员和各界知名人士出席了大会。陈毅副总理和总理随行人员中的其他高级人员以及中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力也出席了大会。

    周总理指出，“我们两国始终不渝地坚持和平共处的五项原则，不懈地维护我们之间的友谊。”他说，由于中尼关于两国边界问题的协定和经济援助协定的签订，两国之间的友好合作关系进入了一个新的阶段。
    周总理强调中国和尼泊尔之间的经济合作。他说，“亚非国家中任何一个国家的民族经济发展本身就是对于另外一些国家的鼓舞和支持。中国人民就是本着这种精神加强同亚非国家的经济合作的。”周总理的讲话博得了热烈的掌声。
    尼泊尔上议院议长丹·巴·辛格在欢迎周总理时说，周总理的友好表示在尼泊尔全国人民的心中造成了一种愉快的气氛。这将肯定加强两国之间的友谊。他表示相信两国之间的一切问题都将得到和平和友好的解决。

    尼泊尔商会（拉萨）主席格尔·图拉达尔在讲话时说，中国同尼泊尔之间的商业往来已经有几千年的历史。他说，因此对两国之间的贸易将日益增加这一点是没有理由怀疑的。
    周恩来总理在招待会上说，中国同尼泊尔自古以来就有了文化和商业往来。现在，两国的经济和贸易往来，不仅应该在尼泊尔同中国西藏地区之间，而且应该在更大的范围内得到愈来愈大的发展。周恩来总理又说，虽然两国之间、特别是尼泊尔同中国西藏地区之间横卧着高山，但我们希望仍旧有可能建立直接的交通联系。
    招待会在十分友好的气氛中进行。
