Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the draft 1960 state budget, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. From these reports, we further understand that the great victory of continuous leaps forward achieved by the people of our country is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the three magic weapons: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The reports present us with a magnificent picture of the continuous leaps forward of the people of our country, giving us even greater encouragement. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army guarding the border of Yunnan will certainly, in accordance with the spirit of this conference, work with the people of the whole country to mobilize all positive factors, exert greater efforts, and strive to complete this year's glorious tasks.

Over the past year, the PLA units stationed on the Yunnan border, like all fraternal units across the country, under the inspiration of the continuous leaps forward of the people of the whole country, have continued to successfully complete their tasks in border defense, training, and production. Now, I will give the conference a brief report on the leaping progress of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Simao troops stationed on the Yunnan border in carrying out amateur agricultural and sideline production.

Since entering the border areas, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Simao troops have always followed the teachings of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, adhered to and carried forward the fine tradition of our army of always being both a fighting force and a working force, and carried out the glorious task of being both a socialist defender and a socialist builder. While completing border defense and training tasks, they have always tried their best to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland, and reduce the national expenditure. In the early days of entering Simao, when the commanders and fighters saw that the area known as the "Granary of Southern Yunnan" was ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, with sparsely populated areas and abandoned fields, and that the troops' non-staple foods had to be completely supplied from the interior, they were determined to launch an agricultural and sideline production campaign to solve the supply of non-staple foods through self-reliance. At that time, the troops encountered many difficulties in carrying out agricultural and sideline production. There were no vegetable plots, no seeds, no irrigation canals, and no tools. However, difficulties absolutely cannot stop the border fighters. They got up early and went to bed late, "If there are no vegetable plots, we will open them ourselves; if there are no pigsties, we will build them ourselves; if there are no hoes, we will make them ourselves; if there is a shortage of water, we will open ditches." If there are no seeds, we will ask the inland farms for support, and write letters to our hometowns. In this way, before long, large Northeastern radishes, Henan cabbages, Sichuan peppers, and Shandong scallions grew on the border lands. From then on, the foundation of amateur agricultural and sideline production was laid, and its scale grew day by day. In 1958, inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward of the people of the whole country, the amateur agricultural and sideline production campaign was further launched, achieving a large degree of self-sufficiency. Last year, after the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued instructions on the army's engagement in industrial and agricultural production, especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the development of pig raising, the officers and soldiers were even more high-spirited and enthusiastically plunged into this campaign, making the amateur agricultural and sideline production usher in a greater leap forward situation.

Through the efforts of 1959, as of the end of February this year, the agricultural and sideline production of the Simao troops has reached full self-sufficiency in non-staple foods. Pork has reached 102% of the supply standard, and the number of pigs in stock has reached an average of two pigs for every three people. Vegetables have reached 141.96% of the supply standard. In addition, the production of cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, bananas, etc., is not included in this list.

The overall bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline production has brought many benefits to the border troops:

    The life of the troops has been significantly improved. In the early days of entering Simao, the troops ate dried vegetables every day. Later, although there were improvements year by year, there were still phenomena of shortages and untimely supplies. Now, with full self-sufficiency in non-staple foods, the situation has greatly changed. Generally, each company can eat two or three dishes and a soup for each meal. At the same time, because a portion of the production income is used to subsidize the cultural and recreational expenses of the troops, adding cultural and recreational equipment and building swimming pools, the cultural and recreational life of the troops has become richer. This has powerfully guaranteed the health of the officers and soldiers and promoted the troops to better complete the arduous tasks of border defense and training. As the soldiers said in a clapper rhyme poem: "The big pigs are raised fat and fat, the vegetables grow vigorously, the food and recreation are leaping forward together, we are strong and healthy to defend the country!"

    Self-sufficiency in non-staple foods has saved a lot of expenses. Before self-sufficiency, the non-staple foods transported from the interior included seaweed from Shanghai, vermicelli from Chongqing, cured meat from Kunming, etc., and most of them were transported by mule teams, which increased the national expenditure and occupied a lot of transportation capacity. Now, this expense can be completely saved, and the troops have also turned over a lot of profits. The funds for expanding reproduction are also directly allocated from the production income. This has played a role in supporting the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Due to the bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline production last year, in addition to ensuring self-sufficiency, it has also supported local government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and markets. Since 1958, more than 50,000 jin of pork and 280,000 jin of vegetables have been provided to support local areas. Sometimes, the Simao Commercial Bureau would call in the evening saying that the market needed support, and the next morning the troops would send the vegetables and pork to the Commercial Bureau according to quality and quantity. Sometimes, when Jinghong, the capital of the Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture, which is dozens of kilometers away from the garrison, needed support, the troops would also promptly send non-staple foods to supply the needs of the market. Last year, when the Simao Dongfeng People's Commune urgently needed vegetable seedlings and vegetable seeds, the troops promptly supported 22 varieties. This has also played a certain role in promoting the development of production among minority compatriots. The relationship between the army and the people and between the army and the government has also become closer.

    Vigorously engaging in the agricultural and sideline production campaign has also enabled the officers and soldiers to learn the necessary production knowledge, and their communist consciousness and labor concepts have also been greatly improved. Love of labor has become a new fashion.

    Vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production has also made the garrison area extraordinarily beautiful. The natural scenery of the Simao area is already very good, with dense forests and fragrant orchards, and birds singing and flowers fragrant all year round. Now, bean trellises and melon sheds have been built in front of and behind the houses in the troops' garrison area, fish ponds and lotus ponds have been dug on the open spaces, bananas have become forests, castor beans have become shade, and the paths of rammed earth crisscross the camp area, making it even more like a large garden.

In short, the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and sideline production has brought us a bumper harvest in both economic and political terms. Our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in 1945 when discussing the movement for self-sufficiency in production in the army: "If there is a movement for self-sufficiency in production, their fighting, training and work will be more energetic and more active; their discipline, their internal unity and external unity will be better. This is the product of our long-term guerrilla warfare in China, and this is our glory. If we learn this lesson, we will not be afraid of any material difficulties, we will be more energetic and vigorous year by year, and the stronger we fight, the stronger we will become. Only we can overwhelm the enemy, and we are not afraid of the enemy overwhelming us." Past facts have already proved the brilliance of Chairman Mao's judgment. Today's facts continue to prove the brilliant radiance of Chairman Mao's instructions.

Why has the agricultural and sideline production of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Simao troops been able to achieve such a high rate of development, from starting from scratch to having a surplus? The most fundamental reason is that the brilliance of the Party's General Line for socialist construction shines on every officer and soldier, and everyone has been encouraged to exert their efforts. Efforts produce methods, and efforts produce time. The surging high tide of the Great Leap Forward of the people of the whole country has also promoted us to lead the movement to a climax. Specifically speaking, we have the following four main experiences:

    First, put politics in command and let ideology lead. Only through repeated and in-depth mobilization can everyone recognize that the troops' engagement in agricultural and sideline production is not only to ensure supply and improve life, but more importantly to support socialist construction and improve the concept of labor and communist consciousness, so that the masses can consciously act. For example, Company A of the Simao troops, although its production was good in the past, always failed to make a breakthrough in pig raising. Last year, 21 piglets were born, but 18 died. There was even a litter born there, and the company did not know about it. At the end of the year, there were only 18 pigs in stock. This was because the company did not truly value pig raising, and the breeder was not properly selected. Later, the Party branch personally led the troops to study the instructions of the Central Committee, criticized the cowardly and lazy thoughts of "this is difficult, that is difficult," and realized the significance of pig raising. After that, the company's pig raising business was completely renewed. The masses selected Huang Benhua, who was ideologically progressive and worked actively, to raise pigs, and sent him to the pig farm with gongs and drums. He himself said that he would "take the pig farm as his home and pig raising as his career," often working until late at night and using his allowance to buy four books on pig raising experience to study hard. The company commander and instructor also went to the pigsty twice a day. When the sows gave birth to piglets, they stayed up late with the soldiers. Everyone established the idea of being proud of raising pigs. As a result, two months later, the company achieved the requirements of one pig per person and one mu of land per person.

    Second, leaders take the lead in doing things themselves and vigorously launch mass movements. When the vast number of officers and soldiers truly acted, all difficulties were readily solved. In the process of raising a large number of pigs last winter and this spring, swine fever was prevalent. All the veterinary personnel of the entire army contributed ideas and studied them individually. After many experiments, they finally made two prescriptions, and the cure rate reached 85%. Due to the lack of feed, responsible cadres personally carried their luggage and led the troops to climb mountains and wade through rivers to collect wild feed in the deep mountains and dense forests, collecting more than 800,000 jin of more than 20 kinds in two months. When there were not enough pigsties, they went to the mountains to cut wood and burn bricks and tiles themselves, and rushed to build them day and night, building more than 500 in less than two months. Many soldiers who were about to be demobilized said, "I will not leave if the pigsty is not built well, I will not leave if the wasteland is not reclaimed, I will not leave if the vegetables are not planted, and I will not leave if the canals are not dug." Many logistics cadres and political work cadres also personally went to the pigsty to be breeders, and the pig raising craze unfolded in a vigorous way. At the same time, the cadres' theoretical and cultural studies and various preparations for the troops' training were also successfully completed, achieving the goal of ensuring that training and production were not delayed.

    Third, the troops' agricultural and sideline production should establish close ties with local areas. The achievements of the Simao troops in agricultural and sideline production are inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the local government and people of all ethnic groups. For example, as long as the troops requested it, they would always be given pigs, land, agricultural tools, seeds, and even production technology. When the troops were reclaiming wasteland, the state-owned Liming Farm sent tractors; when the troops lacked materials to build pigsties, the Simao Water Conservancy Headquarters and the state-owned tea factory sent bricks, stones, and wood, and also sent engineering and technical personnel to impart technology and help design. These also further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the officers and soldiers.

    Fourth, implement the policy of walking on two legs and manage scientifically. In view of the characteristics of amateur production, the Simao troops first grasped the link of rationally arranging labor. They adopted the method of combining specialized management with mass amateur labor, combining collective production with decentralized production, and combining large plots of land with small plots of land, to ensure that duty, training and production could all go hand in hand. Taking Company Three of a certain unit as an example, last year the self-sufficiency rate of vegetables in the company was only about 10% at one time. In order to break through this barrier, in addition to taking out two soldiers to take charge of the vegetable fields, they used the daily game time to have each squad and platoon send people to water and fertilize; when they encountered times when more labor was needed such as digging the ground, planting vegetables, and accumulating fertilizer, the entire company would work together; and the officers and soldiers were mobilized to plant vegetables in all places where vegetables could be planted such as in the fields, roadsides, in front of and behind houses; and the entire company launched a "one melon" movement. After three months of hard work, they not only achieved full self-sufficiency in vegetables, but also increased it by 20% compared to the supply standard. Of the 170,000 workdays that the Simao troops invested in agricultural and sideline production last year, more than two-thirds were squeezed out of the gaps in duty and training using this method. Another link that the Simao troops firmly grasped was to try every means to select seeds and cultivate seedlings. In vegetable production, the method of cross-planting was adopted to make the vegetable fields evergreen throughout the four seasons. In pig production, the policy of self-breeding and self-raising was implemented to ensure that the sows did not become empty, so that production always followed one wave after another, and one wave was higher than the previous one. Another link is to vigorously carry out technological innovation and tool reform. As a result of the reform, the number of pigs that could be fed by each person could be increased from 40 to more than 150. Because of the adoption of the above series of methods that were suitable for local conditions and suitable for the times, the contradiction between duty, training and production was more effectively resolved, and continuous leaping progress was guaranteed.

The commanders and fighters of the Simao troops used such hard work and wisdom to make their lives more and more beautiful and to make the troops' combat effectiveness increasingly stronger. Their new efforts in 1960 are to achieve full self-sufficiency in vegetables, pork, and edible oil, to achieve the indicators stipulated by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army to be achieved in two or three years ahead of schedule, and to ensure one pig per person at the end of the year, and strive for one and a half pigs per person, and prepare to support local areas and fraternal troops with more products.

When the inspiring good news of the national economic development indicators determined by this conference for our country in 1960 and the advancement of the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program reached the border areas, the officers and soldiers were even more inspired. It is foreseeable that the upsurge of agricultural and sideline production will surely lead to a new peak, and border defense duties and training tasks will be completed more successfully.

The situation I have reported is only one aspect of one unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. As far as I know, there are many moving examples of leaping progress in fraternal troops all over the country since last year. We officers and soldiers guarding the border are determined to learn better and more from fraternal troops and learn from the people of the whole country, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, we will leap forward again in the first year of the great 1960s!

专栏：

    重建“滇南谷仓”
    崔建功代表谈部队大搞农副业生产的成就主席、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告。从这些报告中，我们进一步领会到我国人民所取得的连续跃进的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的胜利。报告把我国人民继续跃进的宏伟壮丽的巨画展现在我们面前，更给了我们巨大的鼓舞。我们守卫在云南边疆的中国人民解放军指战员，一定根据这次大会的精神，和全国人民一道，调动一切积极因素，发挥更大的干劲，为完成今年的光荣任务而奋斗。
    一年来，驻云南边疆的解放军部队，和全国各兄弟部队一样，在全国人民不断跃进的鼓舞下，在边防、训练、生产等各个方面继续圆满地完成了任务。现在，我仅就驻守云
  南边疆的中国人民解放军驻思茅部队进行业余农副业生产的跃进情况，向大会作一简略汇报。
    中国人民解放军驻思茅部队，进驻边疆以来，一直遵循着我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的教导，坚持和发扬了我军永远是战斗队又是工作队的优良传统，执行着既是社会主义保卫者又是社会主义建设者的光荣任务。在完成边防、训练任务的同时，总是千方百计地为祖国社会主义建设贡献着自己的力量。在进驻思茅之初，指战员们看到素称“滇南的谷仓”被国民党反动派糟蹋得人烟稀少，田园荒芜，部队的副食不得不完全由内地供应的时候，就决心开展农副业生产运动，自力更生地来解决副食品的供应，以减少国家开支。当时，部队开展农副业生产遇到的困难很多，没有菜地，没有种籽，没有可供灌溉的渠道，没有工具。但是，困难绝对难不住边疆战士，他们早起晚睡，“没有菜地自己开，没有猪厩自己盖，没有锄头自己打，缺水就把沟渠开”。没有种籽，就请内地农场支援，就写信向家乡要。这样，隔了没多久，边疆的土地上就长出了东北的大萝卜，河南的
  白菜，四川的辣椒，山东的大葱。从此，业余农副业生产的基础奠定了下来，并且规模日益扩大。到了1958年，在全国人民大跃进的形势鼓舞下，业余的农副业生产运动就进一步开展起来，做到了大部自给。去年，解放军总政治部发布了关于军队进行工农业生产的指示以后，特别是在党的八届八中全会和党中央、毛主席发出发展养猪事业的号召之后，官兵们更是人人意气风发，热情奔放地投入到这一运动当中，使业余的农副业生产出现了更大跃进的局面。
    经过1959年的努力，截至今年2月底，驻思茅部队的农副业生产，已经达到副食全部自给。猪肉达到供给标准的102％，存栏头数达到平均三人两头。蔬菜达到供给标准的141.96％。此外，牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鱼、芭蕉等等生产还不在此例。
    农副业的全面丰收，给边疆部队带来了许多好处： 　 部队的生活，得到了显著改善。进驻思茅之初，部队天天吃干菜，后来，虽然逐年有所改善，但还是有青黄不接，供应不及时的现象。现在，副食全部自给了，情况就大为改观。一般连队每餐都能吃到两三个菜、一个汤。同时，由于将生产收益的一部分用来补助部队的文娱费用，添置了文娱器材，修建了游泳池，部队的文娱生活更丰富了起来。这就有力地保证了指战员的健康，促进了部队更好地完成边防、训练等繁重任务。正如战士们在一首快板诗中所说的那样：“大猪养得肥又肥，蔬菜长得旺又旺，伙食文娱双跃进，身强力壮保国防！”
    副食的自给，节省了许多经费。没有自给之前，从内地运去的副食，有上海的海带、重庆的粉条、昆明的腌肉等等，而且大都是靠马帮送去的，这样，就增加了国家的开支，占用了很多运输力。现在，这笔费用可以完全节省下来，部队还上缴了不少利润，扩大再生产的资金，也直接由生产收益中拨出。这就对祖国社会主义建设起到了支援作用。
    由于去年农副业生产大丰收，除了保证自给，还对地方机关、工矿企业和市场，进行了支援。1958年以来，支援地方的猪肉达五万多斤，蔬菜达二十八万斤。有时，思茅商业局晚上来电话说市场需要支援，第二天一早部队就按质按量把蔬菜、猪肉送到了商业局，有时远离驻地几十公里的西双版纳自治州首府——允景洪需要支援，部队也及时将副食品送去，供应市场需要。去年思茅东风人民公社急需菜秧和菜籽，部队就及时支援了二十二种。这对促进少数民族同胞的发展生产，也起到了一定作用。军民之间、军政之间也更加亲密无间了。
    大闹农副业生产运动，还使指战员们学到了必要的生产知识，共产主义觉悟、劳动观念也得到了很大提高，热爱劳动成了新风尚。
    大搞农副业生产，还把驻地点缀得分外幽美起来。思茅地区的自然景色，本来就很好，有茂密的森林，有芳香的果园，一年四季，鸟语花香。现在，部队驻区的房前屋后又搭起了豆棚瓜架，空地上挖了鱼塘藕池，芭蕉成林，蓖麻成荫，三合土的通道在营区中四通八达，更像一座大花园了。
    总之，农副业生产的大跃进，使我们在经济上、政治上都获得了丰收。我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志在1945年论述部队生产自给运动时曾经指出：“如果有了生产自给运动，他们的战斗、训练和工作，就更加有劲，更加活跃了；他们的纪律，他们的内部的团结和外部的团结，也就更好了。这是我们中国长期游击战争的产物，这是我们的光荣。我们学会了这一条，我们就对一切物质困难都不怕了，我们将一年一年地更有生气，更有精力，愈战愈强，只有我们去压倒敌人，决不怕敌人来压倒我们。”过去的事实，早已证明了主席这一论断的英明。今天的事实，继续证明着主席这一指示的灿烂光辉。
    中国人民解放军驻思茅部队的农副业生产，为什么能获得这样高速度的发展，从白手起家到自给有余呢？最根本的原因，是党的社会主义建设的总路线的光辉，照耀着每个指战员，人人鼓足了干劲，干劲出办法、干劲出时间，全国人民汹涌澎湃的跃进高潮，又推动着我们把运动引向了高峰。具体说来，我们有如下四点主要体会：
    首先，是政治挂帅、思想领先。只要通过反复的深入动员，使人人认识部队进行农副业生产不仅是为了保证供应、改善生活，更重要是为了支援社会主义建设，提高劳动观念和共产主义觉悟，群众才能自觉地行动起来。譬如驻思茅部队的某连，过去生产虽好，但养猪这一关总是突不破，去年生了二十一头小猪，就死了十八头，甚至有一窝生在那里，连里都不知道。年终存栏的猪只有十八头。这是因为连里没有真正重视养猪，饲养员也选得不当。后来，党支部亲自领导部队学习了中央的指示，批判了这也困难、那也困难的懦夫懒汉思想，认识到了养猪的意义之后，这个连的养猪事业就焕然一新。群众选拔了思想进步、工作积极的黄本华去养猪，敲锣打鼓地把他送到养猪场，他自己则表示“以猪场为家，以养猪为业”，常常工作到深夜，用津贴费买了四本养猪经验的书刻苦钻研。连长、指导员也每天到猪厩看两次，母猪生小猪时就和战士一直守到深夜。人人树立了养猪为荣的思想，结果两个月之后，连里就实现了一人一头猪，一人一亩地的要求。
    其次，是领导亲自动手，大搞群众运动。广大官兵真正行动了起来，一切困难都迎刃而解。去冬今春大量养猪的过程中，猪瘟病流行，全部队的兽医人员就人人献策，个个钻研，经过多次试验，终于制成两种处方，治愈率达到了85％。缺乏饲料，负责干部就亲自背着行李，带领部队翻山涉水，到深山密林中去搜集野生饲料，两个月中就采集了二十多种八十多万斤。猪厩不够，就上山伐木，自己烧砖瓦，星夜赶修，不到两个月就盖起了五百多个。许多即将复员的战士表示“猪厩盖不好不走，荒地开不完不走，蔬菜种不上不走，水渠挖不通不走”。许多后勤干部、政工干部，也亲自下到猪厩当饲养员，养猪的热潮就这样轰轰烈烈地展开了。在此同时，干部的理论文化学习，和部队训练的各项准备工作也圆满完成了，做到了训练生产两不误。
    第三，是部队的农副业生产，要与地方取得密切联系。驻思茅部队农副业生产获得的成绩，是和当地政府和各族人民的热情支援分不开的。诸如猪源、土地、农具、种籽以至生产技术，只要部队提出，总是有求必应。部队开荒时，国营黎明农场就派来了拖拉机；部队修猪厩缺乏材料时，思茅水利指挥部和国营茶厂，就送来了砖石、木料，还派工程技术人员来传授技术，帮助设计。这些，也进一步鼓舞了指战员的生产热情。
    第四，是贯彻两条腿走路的方针，科学地经营管理。针对业余生产的特点，驻思茅部队首先抓住合理安排劳动力这一环节。采取专人经营和群众性的业余劳动相结合，集体生产与分散生产相结合，大块地和小块地相结合的办法，保证执勤、训练和生产都能齐头并进，以某部三连为例：去年该连蔬菜自给率一度只有10％左右。为了突破这一关，他们除了抽出两个战士专管菜田外，就利用每天游戏时间，由各班、排抽人浇水、施肥；遇着挖地、栽菜、积肥等需要劳动力较多的时候，就全连齐动手；并且发动官兵们在田头、路边、房前、屋后凡是能够种菜的地方都种下菜；全连还开展了“一窝瓜”运动。这样奋战了三个月，他们不仅做到蔬菜全部自给，而且比供给标准提高了20％。驻思茅部队去年投入农副业生产的十七万个劳动日，其中有三分之二以上就是用这种办法从执勤、训练的间隙中挤出来的。驻思茅部队紧紧抓住的另一环节，是千方百计进行选种育苗。在蔬菜生产上采用交叉种植的办法，使菜地四季长青，在生猪的生产上，贯彻自繁自养，做到母猪不空怀，这样就使生产始终一波紧跟一波，一浪高过一浪。再一个环节，是大抓技术革新、工具改革。改革的结果，可由每人喂猪四十头提高喂一百五十多头。由于采取了上述一系列因地制宜、因时制宜的办法，就更有效地解决了执勤、训练与生产的矛盾，保证了持续跃进。
    驻思茅部队的指战员们，就是用这样的辛勤劳动和智慧，使自己的生活越来越美好，使部队的战斗力日益增强起来。他们1960年的新的努力方向，是蔬菜、猪肉、食油全部自给，提前实现解放军总政治部规定在两三年内实现的指标，并且保证年终一人一头猪，力争每人一头半，准备以更多的产品支援地方和兄弟部队。
  当这次大会确定的我国1960年国民经济发展指标以及提前实现农业发展纲要四十条等等振奋人心的喜讯传到了边疆，指战员们在受到更大的鼓舞之后，可以预料，农副业生产的热潮，必将引向新的高峰，边防勤务、训练任务必能更圆满地完成。
    我汇报的情况，只是中国人民解放军一个部队的一个方面。据我所知，全国各兄弟部队，去年以来动人的跃进事例，到处都不少。我们守卫在边疆的指战员们，决心更好地更多地向兄弟部队学习，向全国人民学习，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在伟大的六十年代的第一年里跃进再跃进！
