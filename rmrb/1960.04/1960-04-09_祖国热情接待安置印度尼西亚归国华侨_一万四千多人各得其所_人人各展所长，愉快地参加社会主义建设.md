Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 8th. The more than 3,200 overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia on the second batch of ships sent by our country to pick up returning overseas Chinese were all properly settled by the 6th. They have already happily gone to overseas Chinese farms or industrial and mining enterprises in Yunnan Province and Guangdong Province to participate in production and settle down locally.

Since influential groups in Indonesia began anti-Chinese activities, from September last year to the end of March this year, more than 14,000 overseas Chinese from Indonesia have returned to the embrace of the motherland. With the warm reception and help of their relatives in the motherland, they have settled down in overseas Chinese farms or industrial and mining enterprises in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan and other provinces and regions, and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. Overseas Chinese students have also started their happy study life in overseas Chinese supplementary schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fujian and other places. Elderly and helpless returned overseas Chinese have been placed in the overseas Chinese nursing home in Taishan County, Guangdong Province to spend their old age.

Since September last year, the more than 4,900 returned overseas Chinese arranged for employment in Guangdong Province have received enthusiastic care and attention from all parties. They have personally experienced the warmth of the motherland, so they work actively and are in high spirits. Many people have been repeatedly commended and rewarded in production and work. Of the 120 Indonesian returned overseas Chinese who came to work at the Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory after September last year, half were awarded the title of advanced producer and received rewards in the work appraisal in the fourth quarter of last year. More than 20 returned overseas Chinese youths assigned to work as steelworkers in the steelmaking workshop of this factory, with the help of veteran workers, overfulfilled their production tasks in the fourth quarter of last year and were rewarded by the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Wu Qixiang and Chen Ruihua, returned overseas Chinese who came to the No. 1 Iron and Steel Machinery Experimental Factory of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at the beginning of this year to learn to be lathe workers, had never touched a machine tool before. After arriving at the factory, they studied hard from their masters and often stood next to the lathe to watch others operate after get off work. Now they have mastered the basic knowledge of lathe work. The flanges and screw caps made by Wu Qixiang independently have reached the level of a second-grade worker, and the workers praised them for their rapid progress.

Returned overseas Chinese who have settled in various overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong Province have also begun a happy life of labor. Since January this year, more than 3,000 returned overseas Chinese who have been placed in overseas Chinese farms in Hainan Island, Yingde, Lufeng, and Huaxian have obtained suitable jobs. Li Quanshun, a returned overseas Chinese who had planted coffee in New Tang Laye, Indonesia for 18 years, was assigned to manage the coffee garden in Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island, and his seven motherless children were also satisfactorily settled. Four older children entered the farm's elementary school for free; three younger children entered the farm's kindergarten. The old overseas Chinese Pan Yunhan came to Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm with his family of sixteen. He was originally a carpenter, and the farm leaders assigned him to work as a carpenter in the farm's joint factory. His son-in-law Huang Hecheng used to be a car driver, and the farm assigned him to work in the transportation team. Some of his sons and daughters joined the tropical crop production team, and some became nursery workers. The whole family got satisfactory jobs.

    一万四千多人各得其所
    人人各展所长，愉快地参加社会主义建设
    新华社广州8日电　乘我国派出的第二批接侨轮船回国的三千二百多名印度尼西亚归侨，6日全部妥善安置完毕。他们已经愉快地到云南省和广东省的华侨农场或工矿企业部门参加生产，在当地安家落户。
    自从印度尼西亚有势力集团开始排华活动以来，从去年9月份至今年3月底为止，共有一万四千多名印度尼西亚华侨回到祖国的怀抱。他们在祖国亲人的热情接待和帮助下，已经分别在广东、福建、广西、云南等省区的华侨农场或工矿企业中安家落户，参加祖国社会主义的建设。归侨学生也分别在北京、上海、广州、福建等地的华侨补习学校开始了幸福的学习生活；年老无依的归侨已经安置到广东省台山县的华侨敬老院去安度晚年。
    去年9月份以来，安排在广东省就业的四千九百多名归侨，得到各方面的热情关怀和照顾。他们亲身体会到祖国的温暖，因此工作积极，精神愉快，许多人在生产和工作中已经受到多次的表扬和奖励。去年9月份以后，先后到广州重型机器厂工作的一百二十名印度尼西亚归侨，在去年第四季度工作评比中，有一半人获得先进生产者的称号和奖励。分配在这个厂炼钢车间当炼钢工人的二十多名归侨青年，在老工人的帮助下，去年第四季度超额完成生产任务，得到中共广州市委的奖励。今年初到中共广东省委钢铁机械第一试验工厂学当车工的归侨伍齐相、陈瑞花，过去从来没有摸过机床。他们到厂后用心向师傅学习，经常下班后还站在车床旁边看别人操作，现在他们已经掌握了车工的基本知识。伍齐相独立操作制成的法兰盘、螺丝帽已达到二级工水平，工人们都称赞他们进步快。
    在广东省各个华侨农场安家落户的归侨，也已经开始了愉快的劳动生活。今年1月份以来，安置在海南岛、英德、陆丰、花县等华侨农场工作的三千多名归侨，都分别获得了合适的工作。在印度尼西亚新棠拉野种植了十八年咖啡的归侨李权顺，被分配到海南岛兴隆华侨农场管理咖啡园，他的七个失去了母亲的孩子也得到满意的安置。四个大孩子免费进了农场的小学；三个小的孩子进了农场的幼儿园。老归侨潘运汉带着一家十六口人来到兴隆华侨农场。他原来是木匠，农场领导分配他到农场的联合工厂去当木工，他的女婿黄和成过去是汽车驾驶员，农场分配他到运输队工作。他的儿女们有的参加了热带作物生产队，有的当了保育员，一家老少都得到了称心的工作。
