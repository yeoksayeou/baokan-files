Comrades Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the draft 1960 national budget, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our people, having mastered the three great magic weapons, have entered a new stage of high-speed, continuous, and great leaps forward in socialist construction, and good news of great victories is coming from everywhere. The face of the capital is changing day by day, leaping forward towards a solemn, beautiful, and modern industrial city. Like all parts of the country, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being carried out in a lively and down-to-earth manner in the capital's basic construction units.

    Under the leadership of the Party, our Beijing Third Construction Company Steel Bar Workers Youth Shock Brigade, like the vast number of young people, strives to study Chairman Mao's writings, establishes the lofty ambition of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," continuously revolutionizes and liberates its thinking, and continuously leaps forward in production. In the first spring of the 1960s, we had a good start; the labor efficiency in January exceeded the target by 186%, in February by 215%, and in March by 274%. In the first quarter, we fiercely attacked the heavy manual labor barrier, made six indigenous machines ourselves, so that every process had indigenous machines, and basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. All these achievements are the result of studying Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Party's leadership.

Steel Bar Workers Made the First Machine

    Now I will talk about how we broke through the barrier of making our own machines and then fiercely attacked semi-automated machines in the technical revolution movement.

    Our steel bar work is to deal with steel every day, processing piles of steel bars of different thicknesses into finished products of different lengths, with hooks and bends. In recent years, the leadership has equipped us with a batch of machines and we have made a batch of machines ourselves, such as cutting machines, straightening machines, no less than seven or eight kinds, and several processes have used machines. However, especially the shaping of small steel bars and stirrups are all manual operations. The Party committee instructed us last year that we must make machines in the forming process to replace heavy manual labor. Steel bar workers making machines, this was something we dared not think about before the Great Leap Forward. We listened to the Party's words, put hard work first, and learned if we didn't know how. "Go for experience" was our slogan. We sent representatives to the Tianjin Lushan Youth Shock Brigade to learn, and to various fraternal teams in the city to learn. A group of team members saw a simple forming machine that was not completely successful in the Fifth Construction Company. Although this indigenous machine was not successful, the method was correct. This gave us a lot of inspiration. When we came back, we discussed it and made it according to the meaning of this machine. According to our idea, we boldly changed what should be changed, and repeatedly tested it. At that time, we thought: make it first. Anyway, the motor starts when the switch is turned on, and each part must move, and it will be easy to handle when it moves. As long as it moves, the shortcomings of the machine can be exposed. If we know where the shortcomings are, we can find ways to deal with them. After one problem is solved, new problems will arise. We are not afraid, we change it again and again, and it gets better and better. According to the old rules, making machines requires drawing formal drawings, and then processing parts according to the drawings. However, we have low culture and cannot draw drawings; even if we draw drawings, we still have to ask foreign units to process them, and foreign units are also in the Great Leap Forward, we cannot add trouble to them; besides, if we ask outsiders, we will inevitably have to queue, and we don't know when we can make it after a few months, we can't do that, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, work hard and practically, start from scratch, and do everything possible to be self-reliant. So we drew simple drawings. The team members, in the spirit of "picking up chicken feathers to make feather dusters", found their own materials if they didn't have them, and regarded waste materials as priceless treasures. We turned around everywhere in the scrap iron pile and the waste product warehouse, and picked up anything that looked useful. After finding a batch of broken goods, we pieced together the main parts of an indigenous forming machine. Where it needed to be processed, we started the furnace to forge iron, and where it needed to be welded, we welded it. The versatile skills that we learned in order not to be idle in the past came in handy again this time. In a few days, we assembled the simple forming machine. We tried it on the car, and the power was uneven. The shaft made by the indigenous lathe was egg-shaped and didn't fit into the groove, so we drove the car to grind the shaft; the speed was too fast, so we increased the wheel to slow down the speed; if it was not working, we adjusted the position of the gear again. After changing it several times, the machine was finally obedient. The finished steel bars processed are bent and hooked to meet the specifications.

If There Is a First, There Will Be a Second

    After making the first machine, the thinking was revolutionized again, and the superstition began to be broken. Under the leadership of the Party organization, a brainstorming session was conducted. We used to be a bit superstitious about machines, loving, disliking, and fearing them. We love them because machines produce quickly, which can improve labor efficiency and accelerate socialist construction; we dislike them because this batch of machines sometimes produces rough work, can do this, but can't do that; we fear them because machines often get angry, and if they are not dealt with properly, they will not work well. At the same time, it is believed that the manufacture and major repair of machines are not our business, so some people think, "We can use machines, but we are afraid that we can't make machines" "How can a hen lay chicks if it is not a hen". This time, after making the machine, the team members' minds changed greatly. They all said: "Machines are made by people, and it is the working people's contribution to go from no machines to having machines." The reason why we can make machines with our heads held high is because we continue to break superstitions, liberate our minds, and master the principle of continuously improving from simple to complex, from indigenous to foreign.

    At this time, we saw a semi-automated steel bar forming machine in the construction hall of the National Industrial Exhibition, which has a rather complex structure. It was created by Zhu Guozhen, a carpenter in Shanghai. Since 1956, we wanted to solve the complex steel bar forming problem, but we started with improving tools and did not manufacture machines, and several experiments were unsuccessful. This time, we have a direction, so we must grasp it tightly. Although the staff of the exhibition told us that this machine has not been successful and can only perform for half an hour. We said: "It doesn't matter, new things have no shortcomings, we must complete this creation like relay race athletes and respond to the kind concern of our class brothers."

    The Party branch secretary, factory director, engineer, and Youth League branch secretary led our team members to take advantage of the day off at the exhibition to fully dismantle and unload the machine. Through the combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineers, a thorough improvement design plan was proposed. With the help of the engineer, more than 40 drawings of various sizes were drawn. In order to speed up the trial production speed, the leadership entrusted the Beijing Construction Machinery Factory to rush to produce it. Those who participated in the manufacturing were Comrade Guo Yongshou, representative of the city's heroes, Comrade Feng Yinzhu, Comrade Tian Yaoxu, representative of the Beijing Youth Red Flag Collective, and fitter master Comrade Song Baorui. They said: "This is a new product. Helping the steel bar workers in the construction industry with technical revolution is helping the construction industry with the Great Leap Forward, which is to strive for high-speed construction of socialism." In the manufacturing process, they overcame many difficulties. According to our requirements for use and operation, those who used the machine, designed it, and manufactured it, came together again, and while making it, they modified it. More than 260 parts were assembled in more than 20 days. However, when we tried the car, this semi-automated forming machine was like a "blind horse", rushing around and not listening. At this time, there was another three-way combination. Engineers, mechanics, and students from Tsinghua University were invited to "consult". Luo Jianmin, a Communist Party member and student at Tsinghua University, immediately put down his homework and research topics to help calculate and find faults. They worked hard for a week and failed more than 70 times.

    Suddenly, at more than 11 o'clock in the evening on March 23, the driving gear was crushed! We can't process this kind of part, and our company can't process it either. The Party committee immediately instructed us to ask the Party committee of the Beijing Construction Machinery Factory for help. On the phone, we told them the size of the gear. Their communist spirit of great collaboration is so noble. Comrade Tian Shanhai, the Party branch secretary of the workshop, and Comrade Zhang Yingang, the director of the workshop, immediately decided to concentrate their forces to rush to produce it as soon as possible after listening to the phone. When they found that the size we said was wrong, they immediately turned out the drawings to check; when they saw that the sand turning was too slow, they immediately looked for round steel. However, the warehouse manager was off work. Comrade Zhang Yingang climbed in from the window and found a piece of round steel. And immediately sent it to the workshop. Comrade Xu Chengmo, a Communist Party member and representative of the city's heroes, put down the work he was doing and started turning. Comrade Gan Fuan, the planer, was also ready for everything, waiting for the previous process to finish before starting to plane. We arrived at their place at 1:30 in the night, and they had already started working. Branch Secretary Tian Shanhai never left the workshop. In this tense night, the second hand moved like plucking the heart in six hours. In the construction machinery factory 30 kilometers away from our team, a brand-new gear full of the light of communist great collaboration came out. Comrade Dong Shuyuan, a probationary party member and team member, and I were so moved that we couldn't speak. Holding the gear tightly, we said thank you, and ran two kilometers to catch the bus back to the construction site. When our whole team heard about this, they all said: "Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, in a brand-new society, can such brand-new people and brand-new things come out!" We vowed to cure the "blind horse". After installing the gear, the machine was still not working. By the night of the 26th, three days and three nights had passed, and there were more than ten failures. Some people thought it couldn't be done. However, probationary party member Dong Shuyuan didn't listen to these and proposed: "Treat a dead horse as a living horse and do it to the end!" Chen Deshui, the old master who has been teaching us iron work skills for several years, has been working hard with us since the machine was built, and at this time, he also proposed: "Make the last effort!" Dong Shuyuan pulled over the welding machine and used the welding method to continuously thicken a component three times. The effect was better each time. The problem of this component had been discovered long ago, but because other components also had problems, there was no time to deal with it. It became the main obstacle to semi-automation. By the third time, the machine finally listened. Rhythmically, complex products are made neatly, one by one, at a speed of twenty-four per minute.

In the Future, We Must "Dash and Jump" and Attack "Four Modernizations"

    The making of this semi-automated forming machine is the most vivid communist education for our team members. Everyone said: Under the leadership of the Party, for the victory of the technical revolution, and in order to liberate our class brothers from heavy manual labor, how many people are leaving difficulties and sending convenience, sacrificing themselves for others, and engaging in great collaboration! It is really "when one place has difficulties, all directions come to support". We deeply realize that under the leadership of the Party, implementing the three-three combination, that is, the combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians; the combination of those who use the machines, design them, and make them; the combination of workers, technicians, and scientific research (college students); implementing these three-three-nine-nine interlocking links, and carrying forward the communist spirit of great collaboration, to climb peaks and tackle cutting-edge technologies, then we will definitely be able to achieve one victory after another in the shortest time. We no longer worry about low culture. Under the leadership of the Party, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, "rough men" with low culture, as long as they are in the three-three-nine-nine interlocking, great collaboration network, study hard and practically, can not only make simple machines, but also make semi-automated machines. This makes us understand that it is inevitable to take detours and hit snags in making complex machines, but as long as we make a scientific analysis of all the problems of the machine, then we will find and grasp the main contradiction, and we will be able to use our brains to solve it and climb the peak.

    Our team's movement to study Chairman Mao's works has just begun. From practice, we have increasingly deeply realized that Chairman Mao is the embodiment of truth. Chairman Mao is the sun, and it shines brightly wherever it shines. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of all work. The more we study Chairman Mao's works, the more we feel that we have not studied enough, and the more we want to study. We must persist in studying it!

    Our team has not yet completely eliminated heavy manual labor, and there is still a considerable part of manual operation to cooperate with the machine. The whole team is making a "long-term plan and short-term arrangement" plan. We must open our minds, work hard and practically, make a few more long jumps, and march towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, so that our youth shock brigade will become a shock brigade that makes all-round leaps forward in ideology, production, and culture.

专栏：

    我们是怎样猛攻半自动化的
    张百发代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告。
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，掌握了三大法宝的我国人民，进入社会主义建设高速度连续大跃进的新阶段，到处是大胜利的好消息。首都的面貌是一天一个样，正朝着庄严的、美丽的、现代化的工业城市方向跃进。和全国各地一样，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在首都基本建设单位中热热闹闹、扎扎实实地开展着。
    在党的领导下，我们北京市第三建筑公司钢筋工青年突击队和广大青年一样，努力学习毛主席著作，树立“愚公移山”大志，思想不断革命，不断解放；生产连续跃进。在六十年代的第一个春天，就来了个开门红；1月份劳动效率超额186％，2月份超额215％，3月份超额274％。在第一季度里猛攻笨重体力劳动关，自造了六台土机器，使道道工序都有了土机器，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。这一切成绩都是学习毛主席思想的结果，都是党领导的胜利。
    钢筋工造出第一台机器
    现在我谈谈在技术革命运动当中，我们是怎样闯出自造机器关又猛攻半自动化机器的。
    我们钢筋工这行，天天跟钢铁打交道，把成堆成盘、粗粗细细的钢筋加工成长长短短的、有勾有弯的成品。这几年，领导上为我们装备了一批机械和我们自造了一批机械，像切断机、调直机，不下七、八种，几个工序都使用上机器了。但是特别是在成形小形钢筋和套箍全都是手工操作。党委在去年就指示我们一定要在成型这道工序上造出机器来，代替笨重体力劳动。钢筋工造机器，这在大跃进以前是不大敢想的事。我们听党的话，干字当头，不会就学。“取经去”就是我们的口号。我们派出代表到天津芦珊青年突击队那里去学，到本市各兄弟队组去学。有一组队员在第五建筑公司看到一台没有完全成功的简易成型机，这台土机器虽然没成，可是方法对头。这给我们很大的启发。回来，大伙一讨论，就按这部机器的意思造。按照我们的主意，该改的大胆改，并且反复试验，当时想：造出来再说。反正合闸一开电动机，各部零件你得动，一动就好办。只要一动，机器的缺点就能暴露出来。知道缺点在哪，我们就能找出对付的办法。一个问题解决了，又会有新的问题出来。那我们不怕，一改再改，改得越来越好。按照老规矩，造机器就得画正规图，再按图加工零件。可是，我们文化低，不会画图；就是画出图来，还得求外单位加工，人家外单位也在大跃进，我们不能给人家添麻烦；再说，一求外人，免不了要排队，不知道几个月后才能做出来，不能这么干，我们要按着毛主席的指示，穷干苦干，白手起家，千方百计，自力更生。于是我们就画简易图。队员们本着“拣鸡毛，绑掸子”的精神，没有材料自己找，废料当作无价宝。乱铁堆、废品库到处转，看着有用的就拣起来。找回一批破货，就七拼八凑，凑成一台土成型机的主要零件。该加工的地方，就开炉打铁，该电焊的地方就电焊，以前为了不窝工学习的多面手手艺这回又用上了。没用几天，就把简易成型机装配起来了。开车一试，力量不匀，土车床造的轴是鸭蛋圆的，不合槽，就开车磨轴；转速太快，就把轮子加大放慢速度；又不灵，就又调整齿轮位置。改了几回，机器才受使了。加工出来的钢筋成品，弯的勾的都合乎规格。
    有了第一台一定会有第二台
    造成头一台机器，思想又革了一次命，迷信开始破除了。在党组织的领导下进行了务虚。我们以前对机器是有点迷信的，是又爱又嫌又怕。爱它，因为机器出活快，可以提高劳动效率，加速社会主义建设；嫌它，这批机器，有时出活毛糙，会干这样，不会干那样；怕它，是机器常犯脾气，弄不对付，就不好好干活。同时认为机器的制造和大修理不是我们的事，所以有人就想，“咱们使机器行，造机器怕不行”“不是母鸡哪能下小鸡”。这回造出机器来，队员们心气可就大变了。都说：“机器是人造的，从没机器到有机器是劳动人民的功劳”。我们所以能够硬着头皮制造机器，是由于不断破除迷信，解放思想和掌握了由简到繁，由土到洋，不断改进的方针。
    就在这个时候，我们在全国工业展览会建筑馆里，看到一部半自动化的钢筋成型机，构造相当复杂。是上海木工朱国桢同志创造的。从1956年我们就想解决复杂的钢筋成型问题，但是从改良工具入的手，没有制造机器，几次试验，没有成功。这回有了方向，那就紧紧抓住不放，虽然展览会工作人员告诉我们这部机器尚未成功，只能表演半个小时。我们说：“那没关系，新生事物，没有没缺点的，我们要像接力赛选手那样，完成这项创造，回答阶级弟兄的亲切关怀。”
    党总支书记、厂长、工程师、团支书领导我们队员利用展览会休息一天，把这部机器满拆满卸，通过领导干部、工人、工程师三结合提出彻底改进的设计方案。在工程师的帮助下，画出了大小四十多张图。领导上为了加快试制速度，委托北京建筑机械厂，突击赶制。参加制造的是市群英会代表郭永寿同志、冯荫珠同志，北京市青年红旗集体代表田耀需同志，和钳工师傅宋宝瑞同志。他们说：“这是件新产品，帮助建筑业钢筋工技术革命就是帮助建筑业大跃进，就是争取高速度建设社会主义”。制造过程中，他们克服了许多困难，按照我们使用和操作的要求，使用机器的、设计的、制造的，又来个三结合，边制作边修改，二十多天就作完二百六十多个零件组装起来。可是，一试车，这个半自动化成型机像个“瞎马”，乱闯乱动不听话。这时候，又来个三结合，请来工程师、机械师、清华大学学生来“会诊”，共产党员，清华大学学生罗健敏立刻放下作业，放下研究题目，帮助计算，找毛病，这样苦钻了一周，失败了七十多次。
    突然，在3月23日的晚上十一点多，主动齿轮挤碎了！这种零件我们加工不了，本公司也加工不了。党委立刻指示我们向北京建筑机械厂党委求援。电话里，我们把齿轮的尺寸告诉他们。他们的共产主义大协作精神是这样高尚，车间党支部书记田山怀同志、车间主任张荫岗同志听电话后，立刻决定集中兵力突击，无论如何能怎么快就怎么快，赶造出来。发现我们说的尺寸不对，立刻翻出图纸核对；看到翻砂太慢，立刻找元钢。可是仓库管理员下班了。张荫岗同志就从窗户爬进去，找出一块元钢来。并且立刻送到车间。共产党员，市群英会代表车工徐成模同志，放下正在干的活，旋起来。青年铣工赵佩夫同志本来应当夜十二点下班，一听说，也不洗手了，坚决不下班；刨工甘福安同志也是准备好一切条件，等着上道工序刚完，就卡活开刨。我们夜里一点半到他们那里，他们早干起来了。支部书记田山怀同志一直没离车间。在这紧张的夜晚，前后六个多小时里，秒针一动像拨心，在离开我们队三十公里开外的建筑机械厂里，一个崭新的，充满共产主义大协作思想光芒的齿轮就出来了。预备党员，队员董书元和我，感动得说不出话来。把这个齿轮紧紧地抱住，说声谢谢，就一口气跑了两公里赶上公共汽车回工地了。我们全队听说这件事后，都说：“只有在毛主席、党中央领导下，在全新的社会，才能出这样全新的人，全新的事！”发誓非把“瞎马”治好不可。装上这个齿轮以后，机器还是不灵。到26日晚上又过了三天三夜，又失败了十多次。有人认为搞不成了。可是预备党员董书元没听这些，提出：“死马当活马治，搞到底！”几年来，一直教给我们铁活技术的老师傅陈德水，从造这部机器起，一直带着我们苦钻，在这个时候，也提出：“尽最后的努力！”董书元拉过电焊机，用电焊方法，把一个部件连续加厚三次。一次比一次效果好。这个部件的毛病，早就发现过，因为其他部件也有毛病，没来得及处理它。它就成为半自动化的主要障碍了。到第三次，机器终于听人话了。有节奏地把复杂的产品，以一分钟二十四个的速度，规规矩矩地、一个一个地做出来了。
    今后还要“急行远跳”猛攻“四化”
    这台半自动化成型机的制成，对我们队员又是一堂最生动的共产主义教育。大伙都说：在党的领导下，为技术革命的胜利，为了阶级弟兄从笨重体力劳动中解放出来，多少人在留困难，送方便，在舍己为人，搞大协作啊！真是“一地有困难，八方来支援”。我们深深地体会到，在党的领导下，实行三组三结合，就是领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合；使用机器的，设计的，造机器的三结合；工人，技术人员，科学研究（大学生）三结合；实行这三三见九九连环，发扬共产主义大协作精神，去攀高峰，去攻尖端，那么，就一定能够用最短的时间，取得一个接一个的胜利。我们再也不顾虑文化低了，我们在党的领导下，有毛主席思想武装，文化低的“大老粗”，只要在三三见九九连环，大协作网里，苦学苦钻，不但能造简单的机器，还能造半自动化的机器。这又使我们懂得搞复杂的机器，走弯路，碰钉子是免不了的，但是，只要我们对机器的全部问题，作科学分析，那么，就会发现和抓住主要矛盾，就能开动脑筋解决它，就能攀上高峰。
    我们队学习毛主席著作的运动还刚刚开始，我们从实践中越来越深地体会到毛主席就是真理的化身。毛主席是太阳，照在那里那里亮。毛主席思想就是一切工作的指导思想。对于毛主席著作是越学越觉得学的不够，是越学越想学。我们一定要坚持地学下去！
    我们队目前还没有彻底消灭笨重体力劳动，还有相当一部分配合机器的手工操作，全队正在作“长计划、短安排”的规划，我们一定要放开胆子想，脚踏实地干，再来几个急行跳远，向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军，使我们的青年突击队成为在思想上、生产上、文化上成为全面跃进的突击队而努力。
