Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Zanzibar: Faced with the rising tide of the African national liberation movement and the resolute struggle of the people of Zanzibar, the British government announced on April 1st the establishment of a commission to re-examine the "constitutional status" of Zanzibar. The British authorities are attempting to continue their colonial rule there by expanding certain "constitutional powers" of the people of Zanzibar.

It is announced that the committee, after "soliciting" the opinions of members of the Zanzibar Legislative Council and some political leaders, will make recommendations including the following: the establishment of a "legislative body mainly elected" in Zanzibar, and the reorganization of the current Executive Council into a ministerial system; ensuring the status of the current dynasty (Sultan); and no changes to the regulations on suffrage are currently being made.

After the British government announced the above news, Ali Muhsin, leader of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, said at a mass rally attended by 40,000 people that "the paper tiger of imperialism is cracking"; he called on all the people of Zanzibar to unite and give the final blow to the hateful imperialist system. Abdul Rahman Muhammad, the general secretary of the party, said at the meeting that the people of Zanzibar are not isolated in their struggle. "More than one billion people are standing on our side." The Nationalist Party demands that Zanzibar achieve full independence this year.

    反对英国殖民当局玩弄“宪法改革”阴谋
    桑给巴尔人民坚决要求独立
    据新华社8日讯　桑给巴尔消息：面对非洲民族解放运动日益高涨和桑给巴尔人民坚决的斗争，英国政府在4月1日宣布成立一个委员会来重新研究桑给巴尔的“宪法地位”。英国当局企图通过扩大桑给巴尔人民某些“宪法权力”的办法来继续维持它在那里的殖民统治。
    据宣布，委员会在“征求”桑给巴尔立法会议成员和一些政治领袖的意见后，将提出包括下列内容的建议：在桑给巴尔成立一个“主要是由选举产生的立法机构”，并把现在的行政会议改组为部长制度的机构；保证现王朝（苏丹）的地位；对选举权的规定目前不作任何改变等。
    在英国政府宣布上述消息后，桑给巴尔民族主义党领袖阿里·莫辛在一次有四万人参加的群众大会上说，“帝国主义这只纸老虎正在破裂”；他号召所有桑给巴尔人民团结起来，给可憎的帝国主义制度以最后打击。这个政党的总书记阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·穆罕默德在会上说，桑给巴尔人民在斗争中不是孤立的。“有十亿多人民站在我们这一边”。民族主义党要求让桑给巴尔在今年获得完全的独立。
