Five Million Teachers and Students in Hunan Province Engage in Rice Transplanting Campaign

    (Our dispatch) Hunan province's more than five million teachers and students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools are throwing all their efforts into the heated rice transplanting campaign.

    After the rural rice transplanting battle began, universities, middle schools, and primary schools in various locations established support headquarters for rice transplanting. They rationally organized labor teams based on the age, physical strength, and rice transplanting skills of teachers and students, and went to the countryside to support rice transplanting. Ten universities in the Changsha area mobilized nearly ten thousand teachers and students. Starting from the 17th of this month, they departed in separate groups to Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and Changsha, etc., to participate in seven to ten days of "double抢" (rush harvesting and planting) labor.

    More than 50,000 teachers and students in Xiangyin County's primary and secondary schools have made more than 1,200 rice transplanters themselves. More than 95% of the teachers and students have learned how to use them.
