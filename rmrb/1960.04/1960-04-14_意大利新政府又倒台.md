Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 12th: The Italian Christian Democratic Party's Tambroni government, which was only seventeen days old, declared its collapse on the 11th, and Italy has fallen into a new government crisis.

　　The Tambroni government was forced to resign due to serious internal divisions that erupted within the Christian Democratic Party after the vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies on the 8th. In that vote of confidence, the Tambroni government relied on the support of the extreme right-wing New Fascist Party and four royalists to obtain a majority of three votes, while parliamentarians from other parties voted against the government. After the vote, more than a dozen ministers in the government successively submitted their resignations to Tambroni; it is reported that at least 150 of the 273 Christian Democratic Party deputies also indicated that they could not support the government under the current circumstances. On the 11th, the leading body of the Christian Democratic Party made a resolution to ask Tambroni to resign.

    意大利新政府又倒台
    新华社12日讯　罗马消息：成立刚十七天的意大利天主教民主党塔姆布罗尼政府11日宣告倒台，意大利又陷入新的政府危机中。
    塔姆布罗尼政府是因为天主教民主党在8日众议院信任投票以后爆发严重的内部分歧而被迫辞职的。在那次信任投票中，塔姆布罗尼政府靠了极右翼政党新法西斯党和四个保皇党人的支持才得到三票的多数，其他党派议员都投票反对政府。投票后，政府中有十多个部长先后向塔姆布罗尼提出辞职；据报道，天主教民主党二百七十三个众议员中，也至少有一百五十人表示在目前的情况下不能支持政府。11日，天主教民主党领导机构作出了要塔姆布罗尼辞职的决议。
