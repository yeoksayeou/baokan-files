Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Fujian is one of the major hometowns of overseas Chinese in our country. In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in the province, together with the people of the whole province and the whole country, have held high the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and actively participated in socialist construction. Now they, together with the people of the whole province, are full of victorious confidence, have mustered even greater efforts, and are actively contributing to the realization of a comprehensive and better leap forward in 1960.
　　
　　In the past, the people of Jinjiang were displaced and went abroad due to hardship,
　　Today, the people in the hometown of overseas Chinese live and work in peace and contentment, and everyone has food and clothing.
　　
Now I will focus on reporting the changes in the hometowns of overseas Chinese and the returned overseas Chinese in Jinjiang County, a key overseas Chinese area in our province, in recent years: Before liberation, under the rule and cruel oppression of the reactionary regime, Jinjiang County suffered from years of war, drought and flood, the prevalence of epidemic diseases, rampant bandits, rural bankruptcy, and urban depression, which made people miserable. Therefore, every year, many working people were forced to leave their hometowns and families, abandoning their wives and children, and drifting overseas to seek a living. According to incomplete statistics, there are still more than 200,000 overseas Chinese from the county abroad. There are also more than 180,000 relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese living in the country, accounting for 29.1% of the county's permanent residents.

Since liberation, the great victory of the Party is like the light of the sun, which illuminates the entire land and every corner of the hometown of overseas Chinese in Jinjiang County. The people of the whole county have been reborn. In particular, through the implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism and the establishment of people's communes, the people of the whole county (including relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese) have been jubilant and have marched forward with great strides in the great socialist construction. Great leaps forward have been achieved in industry, agriculture, fishery, culture, education, health, transportation, and other aspects. From 1958 to 1959, more than 20,000 water conservancy projects were built in the county. Together with the water conservancy projects built in previous years after liberation, the irrigated area has accounted for more than 80% of the total cultivated land, basically eliminating the threat of water and drought disasters. Grain output has increased year by year. Last year, the total grain output reached 505 million catties, an increase of 37.8% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, realizing the "thousand-catty county" and shedding the historically famous label of "grain-deficient county." Jinjiang County originally had no industry. In the past ten years, the county-run factories built by the state alone, which have a certain scale, have numbered more than 160. The number of workers has increased from more than 1,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 10,000, ending the county's history of "being unarmed." The county already has factories for machinery, smelting, chemicals, food, etc., and is also building large-scale salt fields and modern sugar factories and fertilizer plants; it can not only produce daily necessities for the masses and general production tools, but also produce various lathes, engines, generators, water pumps, fertilizers, and cement...etc., which can not only be self-sufficient, but also support neighboring counties and other provinces. Due to the continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of the people has also been significantly improved. The total social purchasing power has increased by 15.96% compared with 1958. The county has achieved middle schools and hospitals in every commune, primary schools and health stations in every team, and has generally established public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly. Among them, the number of middle schools has increased from four before liberation to thirty, and the number of students has increased fifteen and a half times compared with before liberation. The number of primary schools has also increased from 201 to 324, and the number of students has developed from more than 30,000 to more than 100,000. Before liberation, there was only one kindergarten, but now there are more than 200. The vast majority of young and middle-aged people have gotten rid of illiteracy and semi-illiteracy. After eliminating illiteracy, many relatives of overseas Chinese can write letters to their relatives overseas. Now, everyone in the county has food, clothing, and work, and everyone lives and works in peace and contentment. The ideal that the people in the hometown of overseas Chinese have hoped for for thousands of years has been realized.
　　
　　The ideological outlook of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese has undergone tremendous changes.
　　Love of labor, diligence and thrift in managing the household have become common practice.

The high-speed development of socialist construction and the increasingly consolidated and healthy development of people's communes have brought about tremendous changes in the entire social outlook, and the material and cultural lives of the people have been further improved, which has had a great impact on the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese. Their political and ideological outlook is also changing rapidly, and their socialist and patriotic ideology is constantly improving. They have increasingly realized that in socialist society, labor is the most glorious, the most respectable, and the most valuable thing, and a strong motherland is the most powerful backing for overseas Chinese. Listening to Chairman Mao's words and following the path of the Communist Party has become the common language of the people in the hometown of overseas Chinese. The broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese actively participate in labor production, and everyone is full of enthusiasm. Diligence and thrift in managing the household has become a common practice, and the enthusiasm for labor has been unprecedentedly increased. In the past, some middle and upper-class relatives of overseas Chinese often compared each other: "Whose husband can make money, whose daughter-in-law is the most beautiful, whose dress is the most fashionable, and whose spending is the most extravagant." Now they often compare: "Whose labor is the most glorious, whose patriotism and love for the hometown is the most active, and whose diligence and thrift in managing the household is the most beautiful." In the hot and bustling ranks of the Great Leap Forward, there have been many vivid examples of "the whole family mobilized," "sisters-in-law vying to work," "old people like Huang Zhong, young people better than Wu Song, and women better than Fan Lihua." In the past, only about half of the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in the county participated in labor production, but now it has reached more than 95%. Before communization, only 2,549 relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in Shijing Township participated in labor production. After communization, the number of people who regularly participate in labor production has reached 4,835, an increase of 89% compared with before communization. At the same time, a large number of model and advanced figures have emerged, and 518 people have been selected as county, commune, and team agricultural models, steel heroes, advanced producers, and advanced workers, and there are many activists. Wang Shuqing, a relative of overseas Chinese, has loved labor, loved the commune as her home, and sincerely dedicated herself to the breeding business under the education and help of the Party in recent years. The more than 200 pigs she and three other breeders raised for the commune were all fat, strong, and large, and she was repeatedly named a provincial labor model breeder three times. Shi Shuzhen, a relative of overseas Chinese in the Longhu People's Commune, was originally an ordinary relative of overseas Chinese who was not accustomed to participating in agricultural production and had a very low political awareness. Now, in addition to actively participating in production, she has also participated in township government work and served as the vice chairman of the township women's congress. In 1958, she and the brigade jointly planted a peanut experimental field, which yielded 2,112 catties per mu. Last year, she created a high-yield record of 3,144 catties per mu and was named an advanced model of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, and attended the fourth plenary meeting (enlarged) of the first committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. Hong Zuliang, a returned overseas Chinese from the Philippines, has become a labor expert in the village due to his diligent study and hard work. The overseas Chinese women of Wubu Village, Xiangzhi People's Commune, organized an overseas Chinese-owned net weaving factory, weaving more than ten kinds of fishing nets, which can not only meet the needs of the fishing areas in the whole commune, but also accept orders from other fishing areas. The overseas Chinese-owned pesticide factory of the Yamenkou Brigade of the Longhu People's Commune has successfully manufactured more than 50 kinds of indigenous pesticides, which can treat wheat smut disease, rice blast disease, and other diseases and insect pests. Now, the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in Jinjiang County and the entire province are responding to the call of the Party and the motherland, continuing to go all out, strive for the top, and, together with the people of the province, are engaged in the socialist competition movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to plant red flags, set up benchmarks, learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward, and make greater and more contributions to the great socialist construction cause of the motherland. And support the anti-Chinese struggle of overseas Chinese with this practical action.
　　
　　Fujian is actively expanding and building new overseas Chinese farms.
　　Preparing to resettle more returned overseas Chinese

Fujian Province is rich in resources, has a mild climate, and is evergreen all year round, making it suitable for the development of tropical and subtropical crops. It has abundant mineral deposits, countless green warehouses, and vast fertile land. In the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, construction is needed everywhere, and talents are needed everywhere. What we are worried about is not overpopulation, but insufficient labor. In our socialist society, people are the most valuable asset and the most active and revolutionary factor in developing productive forces. The era when labor had no way out in the old society and needed to sell labor in Southeast Asia is gone forever.

In recent years, thousands of returned overseas Chinese who have returned home due to persecution by powerful groups in Indonesia have settled in state-owned overseas Chinese farms and industrial and mining enterprises in our province. They have been warmly welcomed and received, and have been properly resettled. In addition to actively expanding the existing state-owned overseas Chinese farms, we are also building several larger overseas Chinese farms to make full preparations for resettling more returned overseas Chinese.

A strong motherland is the most powerful backing for overseas Chinese. We are actively doing everything possible to further prepare for receiving and resettling overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in socialist construction. We warmly welcome them to return and build an infinitely beautiful socialist motherland together with the people of the motherland.

专栏：

    侨乡巨变
    王汉杰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈叔通副主席关于全国政协常务委员会工作报告。
    福建是我国主要侨区之一。几年来，全省的侨眷归侨在各级党委的正确领导下，与全省、全国人民一道，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，积极参加社会主义建设。现在他们和全省人民，正满怀着胜利的信心，鼓足更大的干劲，为实现1960年全面的更好的跃进，积极贡献力量。昔日晋江，民不聊生漂流到海外，
    今日侨乡安居乐业个个有吃穿
    现在我着重汇报一下我省一个重点侨区——晋江县几年来侨乡和侨眷归侨的变化：晋江县，解放前在反动政权的统治和残酷的压榨下，兵荒马乱，涝旱连年，疫疾流行，盗匪猖獗，农村破产，城市萧条，弄得民不聊生，因此每年都有许多劳动人民被迫背乡离井，抛妻别子，漂流到海外去求生。据不完全的统计，全县至今还在国外的华侨有二十多万人。居住在国内的侨眷归侨也有十八万多人，占全县常住人口29.1％。
    解放后，党的伟大胜利似太阳的光辉，它照亮了整个大地，也照亮了晋江县侨乡的每个角落。全县人民从此获得了新生，特别是通过党的建设社会主义总路线的贯彻，人民公社的成立，全县人民（包括侨眷归侨）欢欣鼓舞，昂首阔步地进行了伟大的社会主义建设，工业、农业、渔业、文教、卫生、交通运输等各方面都获得了巨大跃进。1958年到1959年，全县兴修水利的工程达两万多处，连同解放后历年兴修的水利，灌溉面积已占耕地总面积80％以上，基本上消除了水、旱灾害的威胁，粮食产量年年上升，去年粮食总产量已达五亿零五百万斤，比大跃进的1958年还增长37.8％，实现了千斤县，脱掉了历史上有名的“缺粮县”帽子。晋江县原来也没有什么工业，十年来，仅由国家投资兴建，具有一定规模的县办工厂，就有一百六十多个，工人由解放初期一千多人增长至一万多人，结束了全县“手无寸铁”的历史。全县已有机械、冶炼、化学、食品等工厂，同时还在兴建规模较大的盐场和现代化的糖厂、化肥厂；不仅能生产群众生活日用品和一般的生产工具，同时能生产多种的车床、发动机、发电机、抽水机、化肥和水泥……等等，除自给外，还能支援邻县外省。由于生产的不断发展，人民的物质和文化生活也有了显著的提高，整个社会购买力比1958年增长15.96％。全县已实现社社有中学、医院，队队有小学、保健站，并普遍建立公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所和敬老院。其中中学已由解放前四所增至三十所，学生比解放前增长十五倍半，小学也由二百零一所增至三百二十四所，学生由三万多人发展到十万多人。幼儿园解放前只有一所，现在已有二百多个，广大青壮年都摆脱了文盲和半文盲的状态，许多侨眷经过扫除文盲，已能自己写信给海外亲人。现在全县已经人人有吃、有穿、有工作做，个个安居乐业，千百年来侨乡人民所盼望的理想已经实现了。
    侨眷归侨思想面貌变化巨大
    热爱劳动勤俭持家蔚成风气
    社会主义建设的高速度发展，人民公社日益走上巩固和健康发展的道路，整个社会面貌发生了巨大的变化，人民的物质生活和文化生活进一步获得了改善，对侨眷归侨的影响是极大的。他们的政治思想面貌也在迅速转变着，社会主义和爱国主义思想不断提高。他们已越来越认识到在社会主义社会里，劳动是最光荣、最体面、最可贵的事情，强盛的祖国才是华侨最有力的靠山，听毛主席的话，走共产党的路已成侨乡人民的共同语言。广大的归侨和侨眷积极参加劳动生产，个个干劲冲天，勤俭持家蔚然成风，劳动热情空前提高，过去有些中上层侨眷经常互相评比：“谁家夫婿会赚钱，谁家媳妇最标致，谁家打扮最时髦，谁家花钱最阔气”。现在他们经常评比的是：“谁家劳动最光荣，谁家爱国爱乡最积极，谁家勤俭持家德最美”。在热火朝天的大跃进行列中，出现了许许多多“全家总动员”“妯娌争出工”“老者如黄忠，青年胜武松，妇女赛过樊梨花”的生动事例。过去，全县侨眷归侨参加劳动生产只有一半左右，现在已达95％以上。公社化前，石?乡的侨眷归侨参加劳动生产的只有二千五百四十九人，公社化后，经常参加劳动生产的已达四千八百三十五人，比公社化前增加89％，同时还涌现出一大批模范和先进人物，被评选为县、社、队农业模范，钢铁功臣、先进生产者、先进工作者五百一十八人，并有许许多多的积极分子。侨眷王淑卿，几年来在党的教育和帮助下，热爱劳动，爱社如家，诚诚恳恳地献身于饲养事业，她和其他三位饲养员为公社饲养的二百多头猪，只只肥、壮、大，曾连续被评为省劳模饲养员三次。龙湖人民公社侨眷施淑贞，原是一个普通的侨眷，没有参加农业生产的习惯，政治觉悟也很低，现在除积极参加生产外，还参加了乡政工作，任乡妇代会副主席；1958年，她和大队合种一丘花生试验田，亩产二千一百一十二斤，去年又创亩产三千一百四十四斤的高产纪录，被评为全国归侨侨眷的先进模范人物，出席了全国侨联一届四次全体委员（扩大）会议。菲律宾归侨洪祖良，由于勤学苦练，现在已成为村中的一个劳动能手。祥芝人民公社伍堡村二百多个侨眷妇女组织侨属织网厂，编织各种渔网十多种，不仅可以供应全社渔区的需要，而且接受其他渔区的订货。龙湖人民公社衙口大队侨属农药厂，已制造成功五十多种土农药，能治大小麦黑穗病，水稻稻热病及其他的病虫害。现在晋江县和全省侨眷归侨正在响应党和祖国的号召，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，和全省人民一道投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的插红旗，树标兵，学先进，比先进，赶先进，帮后进的社会主义竞赛运动，为祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业，作出更大更多的贡献。并以这个实际行动支持海外侨胞的反排华斗争。福建积极扩建新建华侨农场
    准备安置更多的归国华侨
    福建省资源丰富，气候温和，四季长青，适于发展热带和亚热带作物。有着丰富的矿藏，有着数不清的绿色仓库，有着广阔肥沃的土地。在工农业生产高速度发展中，到处需要建设，到处需要人材，我们愁的不是人口过多，而是劳力不足。在我们社会主义社会里，人是最宝贵的财产，是发展生产力最积极，最革命的因素。旧社会劳动力没有出路需要到南洋出卖劳动力的时代已一去不复返了。
    今年来，受印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害而回国的数千个归国华侨已达我省国营华侨农场，和工矿企业安家落户，他们受到了热情欢迎和接待，并得到了妥善的安置。我们现在除了积极扩建原有的国营华侨农场外，还正在新建几个较大型的华侨农场，为安置更多的归国华侨做好充分的准备工作。
    强大的祖国是华侨最有力的靠山，我们正在积极地进一步做好接待安置华侨归国参加社会主义建设的一切准备工作，我们热烈地欢迎他们回来和祖国人民一道建设无限美好的社会主义祖国。
