Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's reports on the 1960 national economic plan and the 1959 final accounts, as well as the draft 1960 national budget, and Chairman Chen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and will resolutely implement them in future work.

    Now, in response to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's call in his report to vigorously develop comprehensive utilization, I would like to talk about extracting treasures from the ocean and vigorously developing comprehensive utilization of seawater.

    Our Dagu Chemical Plant is located on the coast of the Bohai Sea, using salt as the main raw material. In the past, we could only produce three products: caustic soda, BHC, and potassium chlorate. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, we have carried out a production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, especially vigorously developing comprehensive utilization, which has increased the number of main product varieties from the original three to twenty-one, increasing the varieties sevenfold and the output value more than fourfold in two years. In particular, all employees responded to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the production increase and economy practice movement. The production level has risen sharply, and the comprehensive utilization of non-toxic isomers from BHC, polyvinyl chloride, and other five major projects have been rapidly completed and put into production, not only over fulfilling the 1959 production increase and economy practice plan, but also winning a good start in 1960.

    Agriculture plays an extremely important role in the development of the national economy, and it is the foundation of the national economy. Faster development of agriculture can not only guarantee faster development of light industry, but also guarantee the priority development of heavy industry. Now, we are by no means satisfied with the existing achievements, and resolutely respond to the call of the Party to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. While vigorously developing mechanization and automation, we will continue to advance towards comprehensive utilization of seawater, produce more high-efficiency pesticides and fertilizers to fully support agriculture, and produce more chemical raw materials and plastics to support the continued leap forward of other industries.

    Based on the experience of our factory, I personally feel in production that the comprehensive utilization of seawater has great potential. Electrolysis of salt can produce caustic soda, chlorine gas, and hydrogen gas. In the past, we only used chlorine gas to produce BHC and potassium chlorate, and hydrogen gas was completely released. Now we can use chlorine gas to produce polyvinyl chloride plastic, bromine (pharmaceutical raw material), calcium chloride (antifreeze), and other products, and have successfully tested many other new products, which can be put into mass production this year. In the past, only 14% of the gamma isomer in the pesticide BHC was an effective insecticidal component, and more than 85% of the non-toxic components were not utilized. Now we have utilized the non-toxic components to produce more new products. Starting from salt, we can also produce many light metal cutting-edge products, and our metallic sodium has already been produced in large quantities.

    In order to vigorously develop comprehensive utilization of seawater, produce more varieties of pesticides with higher efficacy, and support agriculture, the workers have shown soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom. Under the leadership of the Party, leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians combine their efforts, cooperate with relevant schools and scientific research departments, implement the policy of self-reliance and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and putting indigenous methods first, conducting experimental research at high speed and putting it into production at high speed. For example, the pesticide tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone was successfully researched and put into production in one week under the close cooperation of workshop leaders, workers, and engineering technicians; pentachlorophenol was put into production in only two days and two nights; chloroform was put into production in only one day and one night. The workers proposed: "Whatever pesticides agriculture needs, we will definitely be able to produce."

    In the current booming national movement of technical revolution, we urgently need to improve our political, cultural, and technical levels. The broad masses of workers are working hard to study Mao Zedong Thought. We feel that with Mao Zedong Thought, we have inexhaustible energy and will become smarter and smarter. At the same time, everyone is also learning culture and technology to adapt to the requirements of the technical revolution. 100% of the workers in our factory who should be enrolled have participated in spare-time study. I personally feel that adhering to spare-time study is the fastest and most realistic way to improve culture. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have relied on spare-time cultural learning to become a worker engineer. Last year, I also combined production practice to write a manuscript of a "Salt Electrolysis Process."

    Every sentence in the reports of the two Vice Premiers makes us happy. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, to vigorously carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, to make the mechanization level of the whole factory reach more than 90%, to vigorously develop comprehensive utilization of seawater, and to double the output value and varieties this year (double the output value and double the varieties). We must build a comprehensive chemical base centered on the marine industry and play a greater role in accelerating socialist construction!

### 大搞海水综合利用生产药效更高的农药  孙维忠委员的发言

    大搞海水综合利用生产药效更高的农药
    孙维忠委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理关于1960年国民经济计划和1959年决算及1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈副主席关于全国政协常务委员会工作报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我就李富春副总理报告中大搞综合利用的号召，谈一谈向海洋取宝，大搞海水综合利用问题。
    我们大沽化工厂位于渤海之滨，用食盐作主要原料，过去只能生产烧碱、六六六、氯酸钾三种产品。1958年大跃进以来，我们在党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的光辉照耀下，开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，特别是大搞综合利用，使主要产品品种由原来的三种，增加到二十一种，在两年内品种翻了七番，产值翻了四番多。特别是全体职工响应了党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召，生产水平猛烈上升，六六六无毒体综合利用、聚氯乙烯等五大工程也迅速建成投入生产，不仅超额完成了1959年增产节约计划，而且赢得了1960年的开门红。
    农业对于发展国民经济有着极端重要的作用，它是国民经济的基础。农业更快地发展了，不但可以保证轻工业更快的发展，而且可以保证重工业的优先发展。现在，我们决不满足于现有成绩，坚决响应党的号召，大闹技术革新和技术革命，在大搞机械化、自动化的同时，继续向海水综合利用进军，生产更多的高效农药和化肥，全力支援农业；生产更多的化工原料、塑料，支援其他工业的继续跃进。
    根据我厂的经验，我个人在生产中体会海水综合利用真是大有可为。食盐电解可以生产烧碱、氯气和氢气。过去我们用氯气只生产六六六和氯酸钾，氢气完全放跑了。现在已经能够用氯气生产聚氯乙烯塑料、溴素（医药原料）、氯化钙（防冻剂）等产品，并且试验成功了其他许多新产品，今年都可以大量投入生产。农药六六六过去只有占含量14％的丙体是有效杀虫成分，其他85％以上的无毒成分没有利用，现在我们已经利用无毒成分生产出更多的新产品。从食盐开始还可以制取很多轻金属尖端产品，我们的金属钠已经大量生产。
    职工群众为了大搞海水综合利用，生产品种更多、药效更高的农药，支援农业，发挥了冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧，在党的领导下，领导干部、工人、工程技术人员三结合，与有关学校和科学研究部门大协作，贯彻了自力更生和土洋结合、土先上马的方针高速度的进行试验研究，高速度的投入生产。例如农药四氯对醌在车间领导、工人和工程技术人员的密切合作下，一个星期就研究成功投入生产；五氯酚只有两天两夜就投入生产；氯仿只用一天一夜就投入生产。职工们提出：“农业需要什么农药，我们就一定能够生产出什么样的农药。”
    在当前轰轰烈烈的技术革命的全民运动中，我们迫切的需要提高政治、文化、技术水平。广大职工都在努力学习毛主席思想，我们体会学了毛主席思想，就有用不完的劲，就会越来越聪明。同时大家也都在学文化、学技术，以适应技术革命的要求。我们工厂应该入学的职工，100％的都参加了业余学习，我个人体会坚持业余学习是提高文化最快、最现实的道路，我从一个文盲成为一个工人工程师，在党培养教育下就是依靠业余文化学习，去年还结合生产实践写成了一本“食盐电解工艺”的稿子。
    两位副总理的报告，每句话都使我们高兴，我们有决心在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，大闹技术革命和文化革命，要使全厂的机械化程度达到90％以上，大搞海水综合利用，今年产值、品种双翻番（产值翻番、品种翻番），一定要建设成为一个以海洋工业为中心的综合化工基地，在加速社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用！
