The National Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Chongqing On-Site Conference has concluded. This conference was convened amidst the vigorous development of the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with the aim of continuing the great popularization and great improvement of this movement on the existing foundation.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has rapidly spread to all regions and all industries across the country within a few months. The content of innovation is rich and colorful, the momentum of the movement is unprecedentedly grand, and the effect is very prominent. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in all large, medium, and small cities, industrial, basic construction, and transportation departments across the country, as well as in financial and trade and service industries, has been greatly improved. Automated and semi-automated production lines, automated workshops, and factories have emerged in large numbers. In the machinery industry system alone, more than 182,000 manual operations have been converted to mechanized operations. From December of last year to April 5th of this year, Chongqing's factories and mines have roughly doubled their level of mechanization. Automated production lines and interconnected lines have appeared not only in mechanical processing enterprises but also in agricultural and sideline product processing enterprises and service industries; not only in large enterprises with relatively high levels of mechanization but also in small enterprises that were almost entirely manual operations. At the same time, great achievements have also been made in manufacturing high-grade precision products, mastering cutting-edge technologies, and diversifying enterprise operations, as well as in the comprehensive utilization and conservation and substitution of raw materials and materials. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is in the process of or has already opened up specific paths for all walks of life to achieve mechanization and automation quickly, well, and economically. Labor productivity is rapidly increasing, and the spiritual outlook of the workers and the entire people has also undergone profound changes, with greater enthusiasm for studying culture, studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Chairman Mao's works, and conducting scientific research. The nationwide movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, with "four modernizations" as its central content, has become the most prominent new thing in the current socialist construction cause in our country. However, the original technical level of our national economy was relatively low after all, and the current achievements are still far from the goal of the technical revolution. Moreover, the current development of the movement is uneven. Generally speaking, most small and medium-sized cities, due to the shorter time the movement has been carried out, are not as broad or deep as large cities. As for enterprises, according to materials from several regions, they can be roughly divided into three types. The first category is enterprises where the movement has been carried out relatively deeply and thoroughly, the broad masses have consciously投入(tóurù – invested, put in) themselves into the movement, there are many innovations, the summaries are good, the promotion is fast, the effect is particularly significant, and production is rising rapidly. The second category is enterprises where the movement has not yet been carried out very deeply and thoroughly, the masses have basically been mobilized, and there are also many innovations, but the summaries are not good, the promotion is not fast, and the effect has not been fully发挥(fāhuī – brought into play, exerted). The third category is enterprises where the movement has not really been carried out, the masses are eager to try, but the leaders are hesitant, very few innovative proposals are realized, and the production situation is not very good. Among these three categories, the first and second categories are the vast majority, and the third category is only a very small number, accounting for about five or six percent. Therefore, to summon up our energy, continue our efforts, and make the movement continue to be greatly popularized and greatly improved on the present basis, is our current task.

Great popularization means to universally carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" in all large, medium, and small cities and all large, medium, and small enterprises across the country; to attract all the workers in the industrial, basic construction, and transportation departments, as well as the masses in the agricultural, cultural, educational, scientific, health, financial, trade, and service undertakings, to this great movement. At present, it is urgently needed to quickly push the movement to small and medium-sized cities and county towns, and to commune industries. Small and medium-sized cities, county towns, and rural people's commune industries are all centered on serving agricultural production. After carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," it will be able to more powerfully promote the technological transformation of agriculture, making the technological transformation of industry and the technological transformation of agriculture more closely integrated, thereby enabling the technical innovation and technical revolution to develop into a broader and more comprehensive nationwide movement.

Great improvement means, on the basis of the widespread development of the movement, to adhere to continuous revolution and continuous innovation. From the improvement of individual tools and operation methods, develop to large-scale and comprehensive reforms in all aspects of the entire equipment, product design, and production methods. If it is possible to reach the sky in one step, from manual operation to fully automated, then reach the sky in one step. If it is not possible to reach the sky in one step, then gradually reach the sky. After realizing semi-mechanization, then realize mechanization, semi-automation, and automation; from automated sections to automated workshops, and from automated workshops to automated factories; from relatively low-level automation to relatively high-level automation. There is no end to technological development. The advanced technology of this period may be a relatively backward technology in a later period. The Marxist attitude towards the technological revolution, like the attitude towards the social revolution, is both a revolutionary stage theorist and a continuous revolutionary theorist. We must continue to break down superstitions, emancipate our minds, dare to think and dare to act, from point to surface, from low level to high level, fight one battle, then fight another. Once the wheels of revolution are set in motion, they will move forward incessantly. For innovative projects that have not yet been successfully tested, we must persevere with the tenacious perseverance of the working class and the determination of Yugong (a legendary figure who moved mountains), not afraid of failure, until complete success. For those that have basically been successfully tested but still have some minor problems and are not yet stable, we must unswervingly overcome difficulties and see them through to the end. For those that have been successfully tested, we must quickly and resolutely put them into production, and on the basis of production practice, summarize and improve them, match them into a complete set, organize and promote them, so that advanced production levels become the level of the entire industry, the entire department, and even the entire society. Through summary and improvement, turning practical experience into theory, and then using theory to guide practice, we can enable new technologies and new experiences to be more widely applied and rapidly developed, and we can also enable technical innovation and technical revolution to advance along the correct, scientific, and nationwide track.

How can we continue to greatly popularize and greatly improve the nationwide movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on the present basis? There are three main points: first, vigorously engage in ideological revolution; second, unswervingly implement the policy of self-reliance and combining foreign and indigenous methods; and third, promptly solve new problems.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" is a comprehensive and fundamental technical transformation movement in production, a qualitative leap, which requires not only overturning old technologies and old experiences, but also overthrowing old concepts, old habits, and old systems; it is both a technical revolution and an ideological revolution. In the current movement, the broad masses of cadres and people have great enthusiasm, full confidence, high style, dare to think and dare to act, and are fascinated by innovation, which is the mainstream. However, there are still a very small number of people who either do not believe in the masses, have many concerns, or are content with the status quo, reluctant to part with the old ways, or superstitious about books, superstitious about foreign countries, emphasizing foreign over indigenous, emphasizing large over small, hindering the development of the movement. This ideological struggle between advanced and backward, new and old, innovation and conservatism, correct and incorrect, is ultimately a struggle between two worldviews, two roads, or a struggle between two methods. Struggle is inevitable, and sometimes it may be very fierce. Ideological revolution is the forerunner of all revolutions. Before the movement is launched, ideological struggle is necessary. After the movement is launched, struggle must be carried out repeatedly. Without a vigorous high tide of ideological revolution movement, without continuing to resolutely criticize and overcome all kinds of bourgeois ideologies and various kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, without continuing to strengthen the leadership cores at all levels, there will be no vigorous mass movement of technological revolution; new technologies and new experiences cannot be quickly used in production, and cannot be consolidated and developed. This is a truth that the experience of Chongqing and other cities has repeatedly proven. We must adhere to the principle of proletarian politics in command from beginning to end in all enterprises, "If there is insufficient enthusiasm, investigate the ideology; if the ideology is not clear, grasp the debate; if there is no way, find the masses; if the direction is unclear, study the theory." In cadres and masses, talk largely about the future, talk largely about the situation, set up pace-setters, insert red flags, organize on-site visits, establish the lofty ambitions of the proletariat, adhere to the general line, adhere to the theory of continuous revolution, and use the ideological revolution movement to promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, should we look inward and downward, rely on our own efforts, or look outward and upward, and be a hand-stretching faction? Should we proceed from reality, adopt foreign methods when possible, adopt indigenous methods when possible, and gradually improve, or should we deviate from reality, blindly pursue foreign methods, and not want indigenous methods? This is an extremely acute question. Its essence is whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, or to achieve less, slower, worse, and more expensively. Many facts tell us that the speed of the movement and the quality of the effect are determined not only by the material and technical conditions of the enterprise, nor by the number of experts it possesses, but by whether it is self-reliant and whether it proceeds from reality, adopting foreign methods when possible and indigenous methods when possible. All those who adhere to self-reliance and proceed from reality, adopting foreign methods when possible and indigenous methods when possible, will do it quickly and well; otherwise, not only will small enterprises with poor material and technical conditions not be able to do it, but even modern enterprises with relatively strong material and technical conditions will not be able to do it, and even if they manage to do it, it will be very slow and expensive.

However, some comrades still do not believe in indigenous methods, saying that indigenous methods can only mobilize the masses and cannot solve problems, and only have political significance and no economic significance. Is this the case? Of course not. It is true that indigenous methods can fully mobilize the masses. If we only want foreign methods and not indigenous methods, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will not have a broad mass base. Indigenous methods can be used not only for mechanization but also for semi-automation and automation. The entire process of automated tea processing in the Chongqing Tea Factory, the automated production line capable of processing nineteen specifications of gears in the Chongqing Qijiang Auto Parts Factory, and hundreds of other automated production lines and interconnected lines in Chongqing are all made with indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Their equipment is simple and can be manufactured by themselves; they cost very little, without state investment; they are fast, taking only a dozen or twenty days in some cases, and no more than three or two months in others, to put into production; they have a good effect, great power, and some not only match foreign methods but even exceed them, and some technical problems that foreign methods have not yet been able to solve are easily solved by them. Indigenous methods can not only produce "foreign" methods, but also produce cutting-edge technologies. It is precisely because indigenous methods can fully mobilize the masses that they can truly solve practical problems. Indigenous methods not only have great political significance but also great economic and scientific significance.

With the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many new problems and new contradictions will inevitably emerge. If the production capacity of one workshop or one process suddenly increases, other workshops or processes cannot keep up; if the entire production capacity increases greatly, the supply of raw materials, materials, and power cannot keep up; if new tools, new equipment, and new processes are used, and mechanization, automation, and semi-automation production appear, the original rules and regulations are not completely applicable, the labor organization is not completely applicable, the technical level of the workers is not completely adapted, and the product design of the equipment manufacturing departments is also not completely adapted; all of these are new problems and new contradictions facing us in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement. We must have a correct and positive attitude towards these new problems and new contradictions, and we must not be afraid of trouble or deal with them passively. Comrade Mao Zedong told us that imbalance is the universal law of the development of things. From imbalance to balance, and from balance to imbalance, the cycle continues, and each cycle takes things to a higher level. We must regard the new problems and new contradictions that arise in the movement as the norm of the revolutionary storm, which is an excellent thing. As long as we treat them with a positive and balanced attitude, they will not only not be troublesome problems but will also become the driving force for promoting the continuous progress of the movement. Therefore, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, actively improve the production management and technical management of enterprises, timely adjust labor organization, timely reform outdated rules and regulations, actively improve the technical level of workers, actively expand the sources of raw materials, materials, and power, and implement comprehensive utilization and conservation and substitution. We must use a revolutionary attitude to conquer the constantly emerging new contradictions and new problems one by one, so that the relations of production can adapt to the needs of the high-speed development of productive forces, and so that all parts of the superstructure can adapt to the needs of the rapid development of the economic base. In this way, the nationwide movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "four modernizations" can become increasingly popular, increasingly in-depth, and increasingly improved.

The materials reflected by the Chongqing On-Site Conference show that the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement has not only created experience for all walks of life and all types of enterprises to achieve semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation quickly, well, and economically, but has also created many new organizational leadership work experiences and enterprise management work experiences. As long as we summarize, improve, and universally promote these scattered experiences or nascent experiences in a timely manner, and at the same time strengthen leadership and solve the problems in the movement in a timely manner, we will surely be able to continue to advance the surging technical innovation and technical revolution movement along the correct, scientific, and nationwide track.

    大普及　大提高
    全国技术革新、技术革命重庆现场会议闭幕了。这次会议是在全国技术革新、技术革命运动蓬勃发展的形势下召开的，目的是使这个运动在现有的基础上继续大普及和大提高。
    以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，几个月之内，就迅速发展到全国各个地区和各行各业。革新内容丰富多彩，运动声势空前浩大，效果非常突出。全国各个大中小城市，工业、基本建设、交通运输部门，以及财贸和服务行业的机械化半机械化程度，都已大大提高，自动化、半自动化生产线，自动化工段、车间和工厂，成批出现。单是机械工业系统，手工操作改机械化的就有十八万二千多项。重庆市从去年12月到今年4月5日，厂矿企业的机械化程度提高一倍左右，自动生产线和联动线，不仅出现在机械加工企业里，也出现在农副产品加工企业和服务行业里；不仅出现在原来机械化程度比较高的大企业里，也出现在原来几乎全是手工操作的小企业里。同时，在制造高级精密的产品，掌握尖端技术，以及企业的多种经营和原料、材料的综合利用和节约代用方面，也取得了很大的成绩。技术革新、技术革命运动正在或者已经为各行各业多快好省地实现机械化、自动化开辟具体的道路。劳动生产率在迅速提高，职工群众和全体人民的精神面貌也起了极深刻的变化，学习文化、学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作和进行科学研究的积极性更加高涨。以“四化”为中心内容的技术革新、技术革命的全民运动，已经成为我国当前社会主义建设事业向前发展中最突出的新鲜事物，但是，我国国民经济原来的技术水平毕竟比较低，现在的成就跟技术革命的目标相比，还有很大的距离。而且当前运动的发展又是不平衡的。一般说来，大多数中小城市，由于运动开展的时间比较短，广度和深度都不及大城市。就企业来说，根据若干地区的材料，大致可以分为三种类型。第一类，是运动搞得比较深透的企业，广大群众自觉地投入到运动中来，革新很多，总结得好，推广很快，效果特别显著，生产迅速上升。第二类，是运动搞得还不很深透的企业，群众基本上发动起来了，革新也不少，只是总结不好，推广不快，效果还没有充分发挥出来。第三类，是运动还没有真正搞起来的企业，群众跃跃欲试，领导却踌躇不前，革新倡议实现得很少，生产情况也不大好。在这三类中，第一第二类是绝大多数，第三类只是极少数，约占百分之五、六。因此，鼓足干劲，再接再厉，使运动在现在的基础上继续大普及、大提高，这就是我们当前的任务。
    大普及，就是把以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，在全国所有大中小城市和所有大中小企业中普遍开展起来；把工业、基本建设和交通运输部门的职工，把农业、文教、科学、卫生、财贸方面以及社办工业和服务事业单位的群众，统统吸引到这个伟大的运动中来。在当前，亟需迅速地把运动推向中小城市和县镇，推向公社工业。中小城市、县镇和农村人民公社工业，都是以为农业生产服务为中心的，开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动以后，就能更有力地促进农业的技术改造，使工业的技术改造和农业的技术改造更加紧密结合起来，从而使技术革新、技术革命发展成为更广阔、更全面的全民运动。
    大提高，就是在运动普遍开展起来的基础上，坚持不断革命，不断革新。从单项工具和操作方法的改进，发展到整个设备、产品设计、生产方法等各个方面系统的全面的大改大革。能够一步登天，从手工操作一变而为全程自动化的，就一步登天，不能一步登天的，就逐步登天，实现了半机械化，接着实现机械化、半自动化、自动化；从自动化工段到自动化车间，又从自动化车间到自动化工厂；从比较低级的自动化到比较高级的自动化。技术发展是没有止境的，这一时期是先进的技术，过一个时期就可能是比较落后的技术了。马克思主义者对待技术革命的态度，也跟对待社会革命一样，既是革命发展阶段论者，又是不断革命论者。我们必须继续破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，从点到面，从低级到高级，打完一仗，再打一仗，革命的车轮一经开动，就不息地往前开。对还没有试验成功的革新项目，要以工人阶级顽强的毅力，以愚公移山的决心，不怕失败，坚持下去，直到完全成功。对已经基本上试验成功但还有些小问题、还不稳定的，要坚定不移地克服困难，搞到底。对于已经试验成功的，要迅速而坚决地用于生产，并在生产实践的基础上，加以总结提高，配套成龙，组织推广，使先进生产水平变成整个行业、整个部门，以至整个社会的水平。通过总结和提高，把实践经验上升为理论，再用理论来指导实践，才能使新技术、新经验得到更广泛的应用和迅速发展，也才能使技术革新、技术革命沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道前进。
    怎样才能把技术革新、技术革命的全民运动在现在的基础上继续大普及、大提高呢？主要有三点：一曰大搞思想革命；二曰坚定不移地贯彻执行自力更生、洋土并举的方针；三曰及时解决新问题。
    以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，是生产上全面的带有根本性的技术改造运动，是质的飞跃，既要推翻旧技术、旧经验，又要打倒旧观念、旧习惯、旧制度；既是技术上的革命，又是思想上的革命。在当前的运动中，广大干部和群众的干劲大，信心足，风格高，敢想敢干，革新入迷，这是主流。但是，还有极少数人或者不相信群众，顾虑重重，或者安于现状，留恋老一套，或者迷信书本，迷信外国，重洋轻土，重大轻小，妨碍着运动的开展。这种先进与落后、新与旧、革新与保守、正确与不正确的思想斗争，归根到底是两种世界观、两条道路的斗争，或者是两种方法的斗争。斗争是不可避免的，有时还可能是很激烈的。思想革命是一切革命的先驱。在运动开展起来以前，固然要进行思想斗争，在运动开展起来以后，还要反复进行斗争。没有一个轰轰烈烈的思想革命运动高潮，不继续坚决地批判和克服形形色色的资产阶级思想和各种各样的右倾保守思想，不继续加强各级领导核心，就不会出现轰轰烈烈的技术革命群众运动；新技术和新经验，就不能很快地用于生产，就不能巩固和发展。这是重庆等市的经验一再证明了的一条真理。我们一定要在一切企业中自始至终地坚持无产阶级的政治挂帅，“干劲不足查思想，思想不通抓辩论，没有办法找群众，方向不明学理论。”在干部和群众中大讲远景，大讲形势，树标兵，插红旗，组织现场参观，立无产阶级的雄心大志，坚持总路线，坚持不断革命论，用思想革命运动来推动技术革新、技术革命运动。
    在技术革新、技术革命运动中，是眼睛向内，眼睛向下，自力更生呢，还是眼睛向外，眼睛向上，当伸手派呢？是从实际出发，能洋则洋，能土则土，逐步提高呢，还是脱离实际，一味追求洋的，不要土的呢？这是个极尖锐的问题。它的实质，就是要多快好省，还是要少慢差费。许多事实告诉我们，运动开展得快不快，效果好不好，既不决定企业原来的物质技术条件的好坏，也不决定于拥有专家的多少，决定的关键在于是不是自力更生，是不是从实际出发，能洋则洋，能土则土。凡是坚持自力更生，从实际出发，就搞得很快很好；反之，不仅物质技术条件差的小型企业固然搞不起来，就是物质技术条件比较雄厚的现代企业也搞不起来，即使勉强搞起来了，也很慢很费。
    可是，有的同志至今仍不相信土办法，说土办法只能动员群众，不能解决问题，只有政治意义，没有经济意义。事实是不是这样呢？当然不是。不错，土办法可以充分动员群众，只要洋不要土，技术革新、技术革命运动就没有广泛的群众基础。用土办法不但可以搞机械化，还可以搞半自动化、自动化。重庆茶厂茶叶加工的全程自动化，重庆綦江汽车配件厂能加工十九种规格齿轮的自动生产线，以及重庆市其他数以百计的自动生产线和联动线，无一不是用土办法或者土洋结合的办法搞起来的。它们的设备简单，可以自己制造；花钱很少，不用国家投资；时间很快，少的只有十几二十天，多的也不过三、两个月，就能投入生产；效果很好，威力很大，有些不但抵得上洋办法，甚至超过洋办法，洋办法至今还解决不了的有些技术难题，它们却轻而易举地解决了。土办法不仅可以出“洋”，土办法还能出尖端。正是由于土办法能够充分动员群众，因此也就能够真正解决实际问题。土办法不但具有伟大的政治意义，还具有伟大的经济意义和科学意义。
    随着技术革新、技术革命运动的深入发展，必然会不断地出现许多新问题、新矛盾。一个车间、一个工序的生产能力突然提高了，其他车间、工序跟不上；整个生产能力大大提高了，原料、材料、动力的供应跟不上；新工具、新设备、新工艺的使用，机械化、自动化、半自动化生产的出现，原来的规章制度不完全适用了，劳动组织不完全适用了，工人的技术水平也不完全适应了，设备制造部门的产品设计也不完全适应了；所有这些，都是当前技术革新、技术革命运动中摆在我们面前的新问题、新矛盾。对于这些新问题、新矛盾，我们要有正确的积极的态度，决不能怕麻烦，消极应付。毛泽东同志告诉我们：不平衡是事物发展的普遍规律，从不平衡到平衡，又从平衡到不平衡，循环不已，每一次循环，事物就发展到高的一级。我们要把运动中出现的新问题、新矛盾，看做革命大风暴的常态，是极好的事情。只要以积极平衡的态度去对待它们，它们不但不是什么麻烦问题，而且会成为推动运动不断前进的动力。因此，我们必须相信群众，依靠群众，积极改进企业的生产管理和技术管理，及时调整劳动组织，及时改革过时的规章制度，积极提高工人的技术水平，积极扩大原料、材料、动力的来源，实行综合利用和节约代用。我们要用革命的态度，把不断出现的新矛盾、新问题，一个一个地征服，使生产关系适应生产力高速度发展的需要，使上层建筑各个部分适应经济基础迅速发展的需要。这样，才能使以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命全民运动，日益普及，日益深入，日益提高。
    重庆现场会议所反映的材料表明，伟大的技术革新、技术革命运动，不但已经创造了各行各业、各类企业多快好省地实现半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化的经验，而且也创造了许多新的组织领导工作经验和企业管理工作经验。只要我们把这些分散的经验或者处在萌芽状态的经验、及时地加以总结、提高和普遍推广，同时加强领导，及时解决运动中的问题，就一定能够把汹涌澎湃的技术革新、技术革命运动，沿着正确的，科学的、全民的轨道继续前进。
