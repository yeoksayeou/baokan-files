The main common point of Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s and Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s two major reports is: to hail the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the basis of this great victory, to further strive for the sustained great leap forward of my country's national economy. Needless to say, my welcome and support for these two major reports will definitely not be less than anyone else’s.

    I
Everyone who cares about national affairs, world affairs, and the lives of the people yearns to be able to get rid of my country's backward situation of being "poor and blank" as soon as possible. Those who continue to suffer from the pain of being "poor and blank" have even more urgent demands. Therefore, the people of the whole country are all jubilant and willing to do their best to promote the implementation of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," which was proposed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in May 1958 based on Chairman Mao’s initiative.

To correctly implement the general line, one must first understand it through study, and understand it thoroughly. This will not only be conducive to promoting oneself, but also conducive to promoting others.

When doing anything, it is not enough to only emphasize the necessity; it is also necessary to find out and clearly explain the inevitability, so that one can achieve the unity of the subjective and the objective, and possess sufficient persuasiveness and powerful mobilizing force. Therefore, I noticed the statement in the "People's Daily" editorial in April last year that "this general line and this whole set of policies of walking on two legs reflect the objective laws of socialist construction in our country." Because, objective laws are inevitability.

The common aspiration of 650 million people seems to be only a spiritual thing, and can only represent necessity. How can it constitute an objective law, constitute inevitability? Here is a famous saying of Marx that everyone is familiar with: "Once theory grasps the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." However, this sentence refers to the side of "going to the masses." And "reflecting objective laws" refers to the side of "coming from the masses." Here, I find that I am not good at connecting historical reality in the process of studying theory, while historical reality is so clearly developing to the present. For example, from the land reform to the mutual aid teams, to the elementary cooperatives, the advanced cooperatives, and even the people's communes, as well as many other developments in socialist revolution and socialist construction, which one was not achieved by the Party grasping the objective existence of the people's universal demands, concentrating them, sorting them out, finding out the regularity, formulating policies, persisting in them, and thus continuously achieving victory? Here, the ancient saying "unity is strength" is in line with the dialectical materialist viewpoint and also has a mass viewpoint. It shows that the common aspiration of the people becomes a powerful material force. Stalin more clearly pointed out: "There are conceptual phenomena and material phenomena in the world." This statement, which lists conceptual phenomena as an aspect of objective existence (of course, secondary), is frequently seen in classic works, but it is often not easy for beginners of materialism to understand; mechanical materialists will never understand it.

    II
The central requirement of the general line is high speed: more and faster is the goal, while better and more economical is the condition. High speed means leap forward, great leap forward, and even sustained great leap forward. In the past year, the question of the "possibility of sustained great leap forward" has become an important topic of my ideological activity. I have confidence in the sustained great leap forward. The basis of confidence, first, is the dialectical viewpoint of "looking at problems from the perspective of development," but second, and more importantly, is the historical reality of the Party leading large-scale production. Between 1939 and 1941, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' vicious means of stopping funding and economic blockade against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Party experienced great difficulties, "to the point where there was almost no clothes to wear, no oil to eat, no paper, no vegetables, soldiers had no shoes and socks, and staff members had no quilts in winter." Everyone knows that the Border Region was a particularly severely poor and barren place with "poor and blank." However, despite the bad natural conditions and the constant harassment and attacks by internal and external enemies, Chairman Mao put forward the great call of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," mobilized the army, staff, and students to "do it themselves and produce for self-sufficiency," and achieved a great victory. Chairman Mao wrote in December 1942:

  "... Starve to death? Disband? Or do it ourselves? ... Let's do it ourselves—this is our answer. We have pointed out such a simple truth: How have human beings lived since ancient times? Haven't they lived by doing it themselves? Why don't we, the descendants of human beings, have this bit of intelligence? ... Let us examine ourselves, from ancient human beings to today's poor peasants, the reason why they can live and live differently from wild animals is nothing more than that they have two hands and extend their hands—holding tools. Let's examine ourselves again, we all have two hands, and we can also extend our hands—holding tools." Please see, what a rich and vivid teaching material of "social development history"! This is truly a "head-on blow" to the conservatives who still emphasize difficulties under such favorable conditions today! I read this extremely wonderful passage in Hong Kong more than ten years ago, and I still remember it vividly today. However, since the third volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" only published the first chapter of the original text, this passage cannot be seen, which is a great pity. I hope it can be added in the future reprint.

This call not only mobilized tens of thousands of Party, government, military, and academic personnel, but also mobilized the broad masses of the people in the Border Region. Therefore, in a short period of time, not only did all "public servants" achieve most self-sufficiency, but the people of the Border Region also achieved abundance in food and clothing. This is truly a miracle!

It can be seen that the long-tested Chinese Communist Party, under the unprecedentedly superior domestic and international situation today, as long as it adheres to the spirit of continuous revolution, it is entirely possible to lead the people of the whole country to strive for the sustained great leap forward of national economic development.

    III
After possessing such confidence, I became deeply interested in the sustained great leap forward. I constantly collected data and looked for reasons from various aspects to enrich and consolidate this confidence. I asked myself: "To sustain the great leap forward, what other problems are there besides the leadership problem mentioned above?" My general answer is: As long as the existing foundation of the great leap forward is good, we can sustain the great leap forward.

Once, when I was writing, I was reminded of the series I learned decades ago from the squares on the manuscript paper. I used the vertical and horizontal lines of the manuscript paper to draw a picture - "a staircase diagram of step-by-step rise". The staircase has eleven steps, each step is equally spaced. Looking at the picture, I found that 'it is inevitable that our national economy will rise step by step, and it will become easier and easier later. However, if we only ask for the same step distance to rise step by step, that is, to develop according to roughly the same absolute number in each period (three or five years), that is still lazy thinking. Why? Because the speed of rising from the first level to the second level is doubled, while the speed of rising from the second level to the third level is only one-half (calculated from the starting point, the same below), and the speed of rising from the third level to the fourth level is only one-third, ... when rising from the tenth level to the eleventh level, the speed is only one-tenth. This is by no means the pace of a sustained great leap forward.

The development of the national economy is exactly the opposite of the situation of people climbing stairs. People climbing stairs become weaker and weaker later, so even if the step distance is the same, it becomes more and more difficult later. The development of the national economy is that the foundation becomes more solid and the strength becomes greater later, so the steps should naturally become larger and larger. That is to say: it should move forward according to the geometric progression (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...), instead of moving forward according to the arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...). However, the foundation mentioned here must be a good foundation. Otherwise, even if the foundation is solid, it will not play its due role.

What is a good foundation for the great leap forward? Of course, the most fundamental thing is the unparalleled superiority of our social system. Secondly, it is a set of "walking on two legs" policies; it on the one hand mobilized the enthusiasm of all people, and on the other hand, it made the production of means of production increasingly abundant, and the layout of industry and other enterprises more and more reasonable. Again, it is the active and prudent, detailed planning, which makes the whole set of policies of "walking on two legs" well implemented, and the arrangement of capital construction more effective. Obviously, among this good foundation, the human factor is the main one.

So, I added two lines to the above-mentioned staircase diagram of step-by-step rise: one line is drawn from the bottom of the ladder along the horizon; the other line is drawn vertically from the top of the ladder to the horizon. In this way, it becomes a triangle with two straight sides and one stepped side. Then, in this triangle, ten horizontal lines and ten vertical lines are drawn according to the height line and width line of the ladder, dividing the triangle equally into sixty-six identical squares.

From this diagram, we can see that rising from the horizon to the first level is "starting from scratch", there is no foundation; the speed of rising from the first level to the second level is doubled, but the foundation only has one cornerstone; the speed of rising from the second level to the third level is one-half, and the foundation already has three cornerstones (one for the first level plus two for the second level, and so on); the speed of rising from the third level to the fourth level is one-third, and the foundation already has six cornerstones. ... The speed of rising from the tenth level to the eleventh level is only one-tenth, but the foundation already has fifty-five cornerstones. The general trend is: the speed of rising is getting smaller and smaller, while the foundation is getting bigger and bigger. What does this show? This shows that this foundation is not good, it only plays the role of a dead stepping stone, and does not exert any vitality at all.

This is like a society of an exploitation system, but it is not entirely like it. It is like it because, in an exploitation society, not only does the superstructure press on the economic foundation and the relations of production press on the productive forces, but it is also one layer pressing on another, the pressure is greater the lower the layer, and the higher the development, the greater the pressure of the upper layer on the lower layer. It is not entirely like it because, in a society of exploitation system, the contradictions between classes and strata become larger and larger; and when developed to a considerable height, the upper layer becomes more and more corrupt, and finally not only does it not develop, but it also regresses and even collapses. These are not shown in the diagram.

This is exactly the opposite of our society. Our superstructure serves the economic foundation, and our relations of production not only have to be suitable for the productive forces, but also have to pave the way for the development of the productive forces. Chairman Mao also creatively put forward the theory of constantly reforming the relations of production and the superstructure, combined with the rectification movement that the Party has always adhered to of "thoroughly criticizing those who are bureaucratic and commanding," in our society, it is absolutely impossible for any stones to exist on people's heads. Here, what the upper layer gives to the lower layer is not pressure, but on the contrary, it is an attraction; the whole society is not pressing down layer by layer, but attracting upwards layer by layer. In this way, the development of our national economy will never be the "people climbing stairs" that become more and more difficult, but a multi-stage rocket rising with increasing speed. The speed of national economic development in each of our periods (three or five years) will never be an arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...), but should be a geometric progression (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...), that is, the speed of a sustained great leap forward.

Of course, metaphors can never be accurate; their role can only be limited to enlightening people's minds. Mathematical equations and diagrams certainly play an extremely important role in science, but they should not be absolutized. Lenin severely criticized the Machist mathematical school that attributed matter to mathematical equations, which must be taken as a warning. Here, I use series and diagrams to illustrate the problem, only to enlighten my own mind, and have no intention of letting them become frameworks that bind people's minds. If we mechanically believe that the speed of national economic development in each of our periods must be a neat geometric progression, it is tantamount to "making a cocoon to bind oneself", setting frameworks for one's own thinking, thereby losing initiative and flexibility, which is precisely against Mao Zedong Thought.

At the same time, the above narrative may be too shallow and similar to enlightenment, which is because my level only allows me to start from the shallow to conduct research. But at the same time, I must point out: For the Party's general line and policies, which concentrate the wisdom of thousands upon thousands of people and have been refined through thousands of trials and tribulations, it is entirely necessary to conduct in-depth, patient, meticulous, and detailed research.

    IV
It is a set of policies of "walking on two legs" that makes the superiority of our social system shine brightly. As I understand it, this is developed from Chairman Mao's "Ten Major Relationships" and "Two-Point Theory". The main content of the "walking on two legs" policy, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun said, is "under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, industry and agriculture are developed simultaneously, heavy industry and light industry are developed simultaneously, and under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, central industry and local industry are developed simultaneously, large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises are developed simultaneously, and foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production are developed simultaneously." This is more complete than the past formulation. Here are a few points that have attracted my special attention:

First, continuing to adhere to the priority development of heavy industry, while continuing to implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link" in industry, has become the main feature of socialist industry plus China's creation. This is the main way to solve the source of means of production. Continuing to adhere to this will one day lead to "qualitative change". At that time, the means of production will be very abundant, the reserve force will be very sufficient, coupled with the full development of science and technology, we can freely arrange production according to needs, truly become the masters of nature, that is, embark on the road of "distribution according to needs" communism.

Second, industry and agriculture are developed simultaneously, and the arrangement of the plan further determines that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined with each other. Raising the status of agriculture to such a height is another creation of our country. In this way, combined with the policy of "taking grain as the key link in agriculture", it not only ensures the increasingly abundant supply of main living materials, but also ensures the main source of means of production, especially raw materials for light industry.

Third, the latter three "simultaneously" must be carried out in accordance with the idea of "the whole country is a chessboard", "under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation", which is very necessary. In this way, while fully mobilizing all enthusiasm, any blindness can be avoided; the offsetting and waste of forces can be avoided, and the normal development of advanced enterprises can be guaranteed.

Fourth, the simultaneous development of foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, although listed last, is equally important. The policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" has a long history. As early as in the days of extreme hardship of the revolution, Chairman Mao, who always cared about the people's lives, had discovered the great role of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine, and vigorously promoted them. At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic, he proposed the policy of "the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, the scientification of Chinese medicine, and the popularization of Western medicine". In recent years, he has also proposed the call for "Western medicine to learn Chinese medicine", which has achieved good results, but even more brilliant victories are still ahead. The harvest in economic construction is also very huge. The Danjiangkou Reservoir saved steel by adopting the indigenous method of "using earth to drive away water", using earth and gravel cofferdams instead of steel sheet pile cofferdams; but more importantly, it strived to "get started" two years in advance, and to play the role of flood control, irrigation, power generation, etc. at least two years in advance. Later, in the treatment of faults in the rock of the dam foundation, the use of wedge-shaped beams instead of deep excavation of foreign methods, and also not using foreign steel arch bridges, also achieved significant results of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The "ants gnawing bones" and "building block machine tools" in the mechanical industry are even more well-known. Examples are too numerous to mention, and there are even more in agriculture. In addition, in the ideological transformation and technical innovation and technical revolution movement, in breaking the national nihilism of the old intellectuals' "foreign fans" and inspiring the spirit of the broad masses of workers to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, it has also played an inestimable role.

Fifth, the five "simultaneously" have all become loud slogans for launching mass movements, thoroughly mobilizing all positive factors. This has been explained in detail in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report.

In the mass movement, technical innovation and technical revolution have become thousands of huge torrents. Here, we see the infinite power of the sustained great leap forward. "Catching up later" has become a law, and it is emerging endlessly. In the past, it took 180 days for Wuhan Iron and Steel to build a 100-meter-high chimney, which was shortened to 90 days in 1957, and shortened to 35 days in 1958, but now it only takes 11 and a half days. Examples are also too numerous to mention. Someone once compared the mutual and repeated inspiration and promotion of people's wisdom and skills in the movement to the chain reaction of atomic nuclei. I think this metaphor can only be insufficient and will never be exaggerated. The reason is very simple: shouldn't the most active human brains and the most skillful human hands be able to exert more power than stubborn uranium? People who know how to use their brains know that brainpower can indeed become more and more effective if used properly. The skills of the hands, which are best at executing the commands of the brain, are also almost endlessly improving. The potential of things is ultimately limited, only the potential of people, especially the collective potential of people who promote each other, is truly inexhaustible. This is the most reliable guarantee for the sustained great leap forward.

The working people's demand to get rid of heavy physical labor and improve working conditions is more urgent than the demand to improve their lives. Because this not only improves social production, but is also an extremely real happiness for themselves. It is very appropriate for them to cheer this as the "second great emancipation". Therefore, the reason why technical innovation and technical revolution can form a torrent is precisely because this movement reflects the urgent desire of the working people and reflects an objective law in labor production.

    V
Compared with industry, the conditions for the leap forward in agricultural production are more demanding. In terms of natural conditions, the expansion of arable land is first of all limited, and natural disasters cannot be completely avoided. In addition, the supply of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers is not enough. Therefore, the percentage of industrial production cannot be mechanically used for the speed of agricultural production leap forward; "even if it increases by 10% to 20% per year, it is already considered a leap forward." This was pointed out by Premier Zhou in last year's "Government Work Report". These words have foreshadowed the need to revise the agricultural statistics for 1958, and also set the standard for adjusting the agricultural production targets for 1959 and arranging this year's agricultural production plan. This year's target is steady, and it can be exceeded as long as there is a normal year.

In order to develop agriculture faster, while further exerting the superiority of the people's communes, it is necessary to actively promote the technical transformation of agriculture; and specifically propose to basically realize the mechanization and water conservancy of agriculture, as well as a considerable degree of electrification, in about ten years. All of this is both reliable and active, closely combining necessity and inevitability, and is certain to be realized ahead of schedule.

Not mentioning chemicalization, so as not to cause a one-sided emphasis on chemical fertilizers in fertilizer production and supply, is completely correct. In terms of fertilizers, the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" not only has great practical significance, but also has great scientific significance. The article by Soviet Academician Lysenko advocating composting shows that this policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" has international significance. "Putting animal husbandry on an equal footing with planting, and putting pig raising in the first place in animal husbandry" is very wise. Combined with the requirement of "taking grain as the key link", in the near future, it can form a virtuous circle of "more pigs, more fertilizer, more grain, more pigs, more fertilizer, more grain...", and the future is truly infinitely bright.

When implementing the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" of fertilizers, we can also pay great attention to human manure and urine. I saw a calculation in the "Fertilizer Handbook": The total amount of fertilizer in the feces and urine excreted by 300 million adults a year is approximately equivalent to 9.6 million tons of chemical fertilizer. (Each mu of sown area can be allocated eight or nine jin.) This year, our target for chemical fertilizer production, although it has increased by 110% compared with last year's output, is still only 2.8 million tons, which is less than one-third of 9.6 million tons. The book also says: "The nitrogen excreted from urine by an adult in a year is equivalent to the amount of nitrogen in 100 jin of bean cake". It can be seen that not only is a pig a "small fertilizer factory", but a person is also a "small fertilizer factory". Although the fertilizer in feces and urine will inevitably be lost in storage, it is still a huge source of fertilizer.

We visited the Yaogang branch of the Taiping Commune in Zhaoyang County, Hubei, and saw the advantages of comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. According to the plan of this branch, by 1962, the average comprehensive income per mu of land will increase from nine yuan to one thousand yuan. In addition, agricultural statistics have also shown the advantages of comprehensive management. In 1959, due to the sharp increase in the income from rural sideline production throughout the country, it made up for the loss of agriculture due to severe natural disasters and failure to complete the grain plan, so that the total output value of agriculture still reached the speed of the leap forward. Therefore, in order to ensure the sustained leap forward in agriculture and to stabilize the income of the communes, comprehensive management needs to be given greater attention.

    VI
During the tour, I also talked with friends about three issues related to ideological work.

The first issue: The issue that some people feel that the situation is pressing, and some people do not feel that the situation is pressing. My view: Some old senior intellectuals have a set of "frameworks" in their thinking, combined with "specifications" in their work and "norms" in their lives, borrowing a term from the mechanical industry, they are "matched". "A big tree attracts the wind", a large barrier is easy to blow down; when the vibration surface is large, it is inevitable that the situation will often feel pressing. When they are pressed too hard, some people will come up with a "disguise to pass the test", and after passing the test, they will wipe their faces and remain the same. This does not play much of a role. But the matter is not serious. I understand the Party's policy, on the one hand, it is patiently waiting, and on the other hand, it is accelerating the creation of conditions. When one day, the conditions are first mature in life, first come a "water flows, a channel is formed", let them pass the main life level. The current situation of public canteens is like this. Some people were initially worried because they heard gossip. Later, they personally went to the canteen to practice, and found that it was indeed faster, better, and more economical than starting a fire alone, and they immediately asked to join.

Some of the work "specifications" may not be changed much, and some do not have to be changed immediately. In this way, the situation is more relaxed and not so pressing. In a relatively relaxed situation, the fortress in the mind is opened, and the "frameworks" in the thinking are also fully revealed. After careful observation and in-depth research, it turns out that the complete set only needs to be disassembled into individual "frameworks", or the individual "frameworks" are further disassembled into parts and materials, and then appropriately processed and transformed, and they all become useful components, parts and materials. The seriousness of the problem only lies in the formation of frameworks, and the frameworks have become sets. The materials are innocent. Analyzing our science and culture, analyzing to the end, it is possible that most of the materials are "heritage". In the great era, broken copper, scrap iron, broken bricks, and zero wood have all been searched out, and there are definitely not many "useless materials". But bunkers must be dismantled, city walls must also be dismantled, and old buildings that hinder construction, hinder traffic, and affect safety also need to be dismantled and moved away. In this process, not only can a large number of ordinary materials be dismantled, but sometimes some valuable materials can also be obtained. The principle is so simple and clear, why be surprised?

There is nothing mysterious about not feeling that the situation is pressing. One method is to constantly grasp the development of the objective situation, thinking one step ahead, and if life is too high, prepare to temporarily (but only temporarily) retreat one or two steps. In this way, "the sluice gate opens before the water arrives, and the barrier is removed before the wind comes", and the pressing situation loses the target of being pressed, and there is no use for pressing. Another method may be more thorough. That is to completely trust the great Mao Zedong era, forget all worries about personal gains and losses, put oneself in the objective situation, and become a constituent of the situation. Then there will be no question of pressing or not pressing at all.

The second issue is the issue of people being "moved in their hearts" and "not being moved in their hearts" in the great leap forward, especially after visiting. I believe: The statement of "not being moved in their hearts" can only be applied to literary writing or ordinary conversation, and it is not appropriate to use it in scientific analysis.

  "All things move", this is recognized by everyone from ancient simple dialecticians to modern dialectical materialists. Therefore, the statement of "not being moved in their hearts" is contrary to dialectical materialism. And using "being moved" and "not being moved" to distinguish people's thoughts and feelings is also metaphysical. The correct method is to affirm "all people move", and then analyze the various different phenomena and essences of movement. For example, one is people who have a high degree of awareness as masters, they often pay attention to the development of the country and society, and they generally understand everything new in their hearts. When they visit, they often feel "very good", but they are not completely without opinions; sometimes they can't help but put forward positive suggestions, but they never consider themselves "brilliant", and they don't worry about others laughing at you for being an amateur; sometimes they also put forward well-intentioned criticisms, but they never pour cold water on the masses. They will discover many miracles, but they believe that as long as they go deep to understand them, everything can be understood, and there are no mysterious miracles. The movement of this kind of person is the most normal and the most common.

The second type is the people who "sleep soundly" in the "socialist train". They usually "turn a blind eye" to new things, and even do not have the patience to read the newspaper carefully. When they occasionally go out for a visit, they will be "greatly surprised" to see so many unfamiliar things. This is called "making a fuss about a minor thing", which is also very natural. After such a big move, they may not "sleep soundly" all day long after returning, so it also has its advantages.

The third type are war criminals who used to be enemies of the revolution and now their fate is in our hands. They generally have the movement of "regret is too late", but there will also be other different types.

Finally, even the spies of the US Chiang Kai-shek clique, if they have the opportunity to sneak in for a visit, they will also be greatly moved. This should generally be "panic", considering the movement of abandoning the dark and turning to the light; but there will also be individual "deeper jealousy and hatred", trying to sabotage and be reactionary to the end.

Of course, there will be many, many other types, and there are also various different forms in each type. Therefore, if someone thinks that it is simply to use these few frameworks or add a few more frameworks to put them on people's heads separately, and consider it an analysis, then they will also commit a metaphysical error in method, at least skipping the analysis stage and directly entering the synthesis stage.

"Conducting a specific analysis of the specific situation" is the method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When conducting the analysis, it is mainly based on people's actions and not just based on people's declarations. Therefore, we say that ideological work is an extremely complex and meticulous work, and there is no room for a little bit of carelessness. Chairman Mao taught us to use our brains. Indeed, there is no such thing as "transforming thinking without using your brain". It is even more absurd for people who do not use their brains but pretend to be transformers!

The third issue is to vigorously carry out the study of Chairman Mao's works. This is a great thing, and it is completely in line with my consistent wishes. For many years, I have repeatedly advocated: Studying Marxism-Leninism must be from the near to the far, from the present to the ancient, so that it is easier to understand and grasp. However, some people did not agree so much at the time; from my own point of view, I still did not learn enough, so I would still make mistakes. It's funny to say that I have read books for 59 years, and only in the past two years have I discovered that reading books must take notes (and at the same time I have discovered that writing articles should strive to easily change drafts). It can be seen that the reason why I did not learn well in the past was because I did not pay enough hard work. Indeed, "science is a honest learning, and any little bit of mischief is not allowed". As an intellectual, it is impossible to "seek thorough understanding without reading", it is dangerous to "claim thorough understanding without reading or reading less"; it is impossible to have achievements without reading seriously, and it is extremely wrong to read books and be divorced from practice and divorced from labor.

    章乃器委员的发言
    李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两大报告的主要共同点是：欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，在这个伟大胜利的基础上，进一步为我国国民经济的持续大跃进而奋斗。不待言，我对于这两大报告的欢迎和拥护，是绝不会下于任何人的。		一
    每一个关心国家大事、世界大事，关心人民群众生活的人，都渴望能够尽快地摆脱我国“一穷二白”的落后状况。那些继续身受“一穷二白”痛苦的人们，要求当然更加迫切。所以，全国人民对于中国共产党中央在1958年5月根据毛主席的创议而提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是没有不欢欣鼓舞，愿以全力促其贯彻实现的。
    要正确贯彻总路线，首先要通过学习，懂得它，而且要懂得透。这样，就不仅有利于推进自己，也有利于推动别人。
    做任何事情，只强调必要性的一面，是不够的；还必须再找寻出来，并且说清楚它的必然性的一面，那才算做到主观同客观的一致，才具备了充分的说服力和强大的动员力量。因此，我注意到去年4月“人民日报”社论所提到的“这条总路线和这一整套用两条腿走路的方针，反映了我国社会主义建设的客观规律”的说法。因为，客观规律就是必然性。
    六亿五千万人的共同愿望，看来好像只是精神的东西，只能代表必要性。它何以会构成客观规律，构成必然性呢？这里有一句大家熟知的马克思的名言：“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量。”但，这句话指的是“到群众中去”的一面。而“反映客观规律”则指的是“从群众中来”的一面。这里，我发现自己还不善于在研究理论过程中联系历史实际，而历史实际又是那样鲜明地一直发展到目前。比如，从土地改革开始到互助组、到低级合作社、高级合作社直到人民公社化，以及其他许许多多的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，那一件不是党掌握了人民群众的普遍要求这一客观存在，集中起来，加以整理，找出规律性，制定政策，坚持下去，从而连续取得胜利的呢？在这里，“众志成城”这一句古语，是符合辩证唯物观点、也具有群众观点的。它说明：人民群众的共同愿望就变成了强大的物质力量。斯大林更明白地指出：“世界上存在着观念的现象和物质的现象。”这种把观念的现象列为客观存在的一个方面（当然是第二性的）的说法，在经典著作中是屡见的，但对于初学唯物论的人，往往是一时不容易体会的；机械唯物论者则是永远不会理解的。		二
    总路线的中心要求是高速度：多快是目的，而好省是条件。高速度就是跃进、大跃进，以至持续大跃进。近一年来，“持续大跃进的可能性”问题成为我的思想活动的一个重要课题。我对于持续大跃进是有信心的。信心的根据，第一，是“从发展看问题”的辩证观点，但第二，更重要的是党领导大生产的历史实际。在1939年到1941年间，由于国民党反动派用停发经费和经济封锁的凶恶手段来对待陕甘宁边区，党经历了一次很大的困难，“弄到几乎没有衣穿，没有油吃，没有纸，没有菜，战士没有鞋袜，工作人员在冬天没有被盖。”大家知道，边区是一个“一穷二白”特别严重的贫瘠地方。可是，尽管在那自然条件很坏，内外敌人又不时窜扰袭击的情况下，毛主席提出了“发展经济，保障供给”的伟大号召，动员军队、工作人员和学生们，“自己动手，生产自给”，取得了伟大的胜利。毛主席在1942年12月写道：
  “……饿死呢？解散呢？还是自己动手呢？……还是自己动手吧，——这是我们的回答。我们曾经指出这样简单的道理：从古以来的人类究竟是怎样生活下去的呢？还不是自己动手活下去的么？为什么我们这些人类子孙连这点聪明都没有了呢？……我们考察一下从古代的人类到今天的贫农，他们之所以能够活下去，并且活得同野兽不同的原因，无非就是他们有两只手，并且将手接长起来——拿着工具。我们再来考察一下我们自己，原来我们每一个人也都有两只手，我们也可以将手接长起来——拿着工具。”请大家看，这是一篇多么丰富而生动的“社会发展史”教材！这对于今天在这样有利条件下还强调困难的保守派，真是一记“当头棒喝”！这一段极其精彩的话，我在十多年前在香港读了之后，到今天还记忆犹新。但由于“毛泽东选集”第三卷只发表了原文的第一章，这一段话看不到了，这是万分可惜的。很希望将来再版时能补充上去。
    这个号召不仅动员了几万党政军学人员，也动员了边区的广大人民。因而，在短短的期间内，不但全体“公家人”做到了大部分自给，边区人民也做到了丰衣足食。这真是一个奇迹！
    由此可见，久经考验的中国共产党，在今天空前优越的国内和国际形势下，只要坚持不断革命的精神，是完全可能领导全国人民争取国民经济发展的持续大跃进的。		三
    在具备了这样的信心之后，我就对持续大跃进发生了浓厚的兴趣。我不断地从各个方面收集资料、找寻理由，来充实和巩固这个信心。我向自己发问：“要持续大跃进，除了上述领导问题以外，还有什么问题？”我的总的答复是：只要已有的大跃进的基础是良好的，我们就可以持续大跃进。
    有一次，我在写稿时，从稿子的方格子联想到几十年前学过的级数。我就利用稿纸的纵横线，画了一个图——“步步高升的楼梯图”。楼梯有十一级，每级级距相等。看了图，我发现‘我们的国民经济步步高升是必然的，而且越到后来越容易。但是，如果只是要求等级距地步步高升，也就是每个时期（三年或五年）按照大致相同的绝对数字发展，那仍然是懒汉思想。为什么呢？因为从第一级上升到第二级，上升的速度是一倍，而从第二级上升到第三级，速度就只有二分之一倍（从起点计算，下同），从第三级上升到第四级，更只有三分之一倍，……到从第十级上升到第十一级时，速度就只有十分之一倍了。这就绝不是什么持续大跃进的步伐了。
    国民经济的发展同人爬楼梯的情形恰好相反。人爬楼梯是越到后来气力越差，所以，即使级距相等，也是越到后来越困难。国民经济的发展则是越到后来基础越雄厚，力量越大，所以，步子也自然应该越来越大。这就是说：应该按照几何级数（1、2、4、8、16、32……）前进，而不是按照算术级数（1、2、3、4、5、6……）前进。然而，这里所说的基础，必须是良好的基础。否则基础即使雄厚，也是起不到应有的作用的。
    什么是大跃进的良好基础呢？当然，最根本的，是我们的社会制度的无比优越性。其次，是一套“两条腿走路”的方针；它一方面调动了一切人的积极性，另方面还使得生产资料的生产日益充沛，工业和其他企业的布局日趋合理。又其次，是积极而又审慎、周详的计划，使得“两条腿走路”的一整套方针得到很好的贯彻，以及基本建设的安排更加有效。显而易见，在这个良好的基础当中，人的因素是主要的。
    于是，我又在上述的步步高升的楼梯图上面加了两条线：一条是从梯子的下头沿地平线划；另一条是从梯子的上头向地平线垂直地划。这样，它就成为一个两边直，一边带梯级的三角形。再在这个三角形中，按照梯级的高度线和宽度线划了十条横线和十条纵线，把三角形平分为六十六个同样的方块。
    从这个图上，我们可以看到，从地平线上升到第一级，是“平地起家”，是没有基础的；从第一级上升到第二级，上升的速度是一倍，而基础只有一块基石；从第二级上升到第三级，速度是二分之一倍而基础已经有三块基石（第一级一块加第二级两块，余类推）；从第三级上升到第四级，上升的速度是三分之一倍，而基础已经有六块基石。……从第十级上升到第十一级，上升的速度只有十分之一倍，而基础却已经有五十五块基石。总的趋势是：上升的速度越来越小，而基础则是越来越大。这说明什么呢？这说明了这个基础是不好的，只起到了死的踏脚石的作用，而没有发挥丝毫的活力。
    这好像是一个剥削制度的社会，但也并不完全像。说它像，那是因为，在剥削社会里，不仅上层建筑压着经济基础、生产关系压着生产力，而且是一层压着一层，越到下层压力越大，越是发展到高度，上层对下层的压力也越大。说它不完全像，那是因为，在剥削制度的社会里，阶级之间、阶层之间的矛盾越来越大；而在发展到相当高度的时候，上层还要越来越腐朽，终于不仅没有发展，反而要倒退以至崩溃。这些都是没有表现在图上的。
    这同我们的社会恰好相反。我们的上层建筑是为经济基础服务的，我们的生产关系不仅要适合生产力，而且要为生产力的发展开辟道路。毛主席还创造性地提出了对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断改革的理论，结合着党一贯坚持的“彻底批判那些老爷式的和官僚主义、命令主义的人们”的整风运动，在我们的社会里，就绝不可能存在任何压在人们头上的石块。在我们这里，上层给与下层的，不是什么压力，而恰好是相反，是一种引力；整个社会不是一层一层地向下压，而是一层一层地向上引。这样，我们的国民经济的发展，就绝不是越到后来越困难的“人爬楼梯”，而是速度越来越大的在上升中的多级火箭。我们的每一个时期（三年或五年）国民经济发展的速度就绝不会是算术级数（1，2，3，4，5，6……），而应该是几何级数（1，2，4，8，16，32……），也就是持续大跃进的速度。
    当然，比喻总是不可能确切的；它的作用只能限于启发人们的思想。数学方程式和图式，在科学中当然起着极其巨大的作用，但也不应加以绝对化。列宁严厉批判了那把物质归结为数学方程式的马赫主义数理学派，是必须引为戒鉴的。在这里，我用级数和图式来说明问题，也仅仅在于启发自己的思想，而绝没有意思让它们变成束缚人们思想的框框。如果机械地认为我们每一个时期的国民经济发展的速度必须是整整齐齐的几何级数，那就无异于“作茧自缚”，自己替自己的思想设置框框，从而失去了主动性和灵活性，而这正是违反毛泽东思想的。
    同时，上面的叙述也可能过于浅近而类于启蒙，那是由于我的水平只允许我从浅近入手进行研究。但同时，我必须指出：对于那集中了千千万万人的智慧，经过千锤百炼而制定的党的总路线和方针，由浅入深、耐心细致、不厌求详的研究，是完全必要的。		四
    使我们的社会制度优越性发挥巨大光芒的，是一套“两条腿走路”的方针。据我理解，这是从毛主席的“十大关系”和“两点论”发展而来的。“两条腿走路”方针的主要内容，如李富春副总理所说的，是“在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举”。这比过去的提法，是更加完善了。这里有几点引起我的特别注意：
    一、继续坚持优先发展重工业，同时继续执行工业“以钢为纲”的方针，这就成为社会主义工业的主要特点加我国的创造。这是解决生产资料来源的主要途径。这样继续坚持下去，会有一天发生“质变”。那时生产资料非常丰富，后备力量非常充足，加以科学技术的充分发展，我们在生产上就可以按照需要、自由安排，真正成为自然界的主人，也就是走上了“按需分配”的共产主义。
    二、工业和农业同时并举，而计划的安排，又进一步确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合。把农业地位提到这样的高度，是我国的又一项创造。这样，结合“农业以粮为纲”的方针，既保证了主要生活资料的日益充沛，又保证了生产资料、特别是轻工业原料的主要来源。
    三、后面三个“并举”要根据“全国一盘棋”的思想，“在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下”进行，是十分必要的。这样，就可以在充分调动一切积极性的时候，避免了任何的盲目性；避免了力量的抵消和浪费，并且保证先进企业单位的正常发展。
    四、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举，虽然列在最后，但是同样重要的。“土洋结合”的方针由来已久。远在革命极端艰苦的日子里，经常关心人民生活的毛主席就已经发现了中医、中药的巨大作用，加以有力的提倡。建国初期更提出了“中西医团结，中医科学化，西医大众化”的方针。近年又提出“西医学习中医”的号召，已经取得了良好的成果，但更辉煌的胜利还在后头。在经济建设方面的收获也是很巨大的。丹江口水库由于采取了“以土赶水”的土法，用土砂石围堰代替了钢板桩围堰，节省了钢材；但更重要的是争取提前两年“上马”，和至少提前两年发挥拦洪、灌溉、发电等作用。以后，在坝基岩石的断层处理中，采用了楔形梁代替了深挖的洋法，而且也不用洋法的钢拱桥，也取得多快好省的显著效果。机械工业中的“蚂蚁啃骨头”和“积木式机床”更是为众周知的。例子是举不胜举的，农业方面的更多。此外，在思想改造和技术革新、技术革命运动中，在破除旧知识分子当中的民族虚无主义的“洋迷”和启发广大劳动群众的敢想、敢说、敢干的精神方面，也起了难以估计的作用。
    五、五个“并举”都成为大搞群众的响亮口号，彻底地调动了一切积极因素。这在李富春副总理的报告中，已经有了详尽的说明。
    在大搞群众运动中，技术革新和技术革命成为千万股巨大的洪流。在这里，我们看到了持续大跃进的无穷威力。“后来居上”已经成为规律，而且是层出不穷的。武钢过去建成一座高一百米的烟囱要一百八十天，1957年缩短为九十天，1958年又缩短为三十五天，而现在只需十一天半。例子也是举不胜举的。曾经有人把运动中人们智慧和技巧的相互、反复的启发和促进比之于原子核的连锁反应。我想，这一比喻只会有所不足而绝不会过于夸张。理由是很简单的：最活跃的人的头脑和最灵巧的人的双手，难道不应该比那顽固的铀更能发挥威力吗？懂得开动脑筋的人都知道，脑力只要运用得当，的确是可以愈用愈灵的。最善于执行脑的命令的双手，技巧的提高也几乎是无止境的。物的潜力终归是有极限的，只有人的潜力，特别是互相促进的人的集体的潜力，才真是无穷尽的。这是持续大跃进的最可靠的保证。
    劳动人民对于摆脱笨重体力劳动和改善工作条件的要求，是比改善自己的生活的要求更加迫切的。因为这不仅提高了社会生产，同时对自己也是极其现实的幸福。他们欢呼这是“第二次大翻身”，是十分确当的。所以，技术革新和技术革命之所以能够形成洪流，也正因为这一运动反映了劳动人民的迫切愿望，反映了劳动生产中的一条客观规律。五
    同工业比较，农业生产的跃进，条件是比较苛刻的。在自然条件方面，耕地面积的扩大首先是有限度的，天灾也还不能完全避免。此外，农业机械和化学肥料的供应也还不够。因此，对于农业生产跃进的速度，不能机械地搬用工业生产的百分比；“即使每年增产10％到20％，就已经算得是跃进了。”这是周总理在去年的“政府工作报告”中所指出的。这番话已经预示着1958年的农业统计数字需要修订，同时也为1959年农业生产的指标的调整和今年农业生产计划的安排制定了规范。今年的指标是稳妥的，只要有一个通常的年景，是可以超过的。
    为了更快地发展农业，要在进一步发挥人民公社的优越性的同时，积极推进农业的技术改造；并且具体地提出争取在十年左右的时间内，基本上实现农业的机械化和水利化，以及相当程度的电气化。这一切都是既可靠又积极，密切结合了必要性和必然性，是一定可以提前实现的。
    不提化学化，以免引起在肥料生产和供应上片面强调化肥的偏向，是完全正确的。在肥料方面，“土洋结合”的方针，不但有巨大的现实意义，而且有重大的科学意义。苏联李森科院士提倡堆肥的文章，说明这一“土洋结合”的方针，已经具有国际意义。“把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，而在畜牧业中又把养猪放在首要地位”，是很明智的。这同“以粮为纲”的要求结合起来，在不久的将来，便可以形成“猪多，肥多，粮多，猪更多，肥更多，粮更多……”的“粮猪相生，生生不已”的良性循环，前途真是无限美好的。
    在贯彻肥料“土洋结合”的方针时，还可以大大注意一下人粪尿。我看到“肥料手册”上有一个计算：三亿成年人一年排泄粪尿的肥分总量，约相当于化肥九百六十万吨。（每亩播种面积可以分配到八九斤。）今年我们化肥生产的指标，虽然比去年产量提高了110％，仍然只有二百八十万吨，还不及九百六十万吨的三分之一。书里还说：“一个成年人一年从尿里排泄的氮素，相当一百斤豆饼的氮素数量”。可见不仅猪是一个“小肥料厂”，人也是一个“小肥料厂”。尽管粪尿中的肥分不可避免地会在储存中散失一部分，但仍然是一个巨大的肥源。
    我们在湖北枣阳县参观太平公社的姚岗分场，看到了农林牧副渔综合经营的优点。根据这个分场的规划，到了1962年，每亩土地的平均综合收入，将由九元上升到一千元。此外，农业统计也已经显示了综合经营的优点。1959年由于全国农村副业生产收入的猛增，就弥补了农业因为天灾严重，粮食没有完成计划的损失，使农业总产值仍然达到跃进的速度。所以，为了保证农业的持续跃进，也为了稳定公社的收入，综合经营是需要给以更大的重视的。六
    在参观旅途中，还同朋友们谈到了有关思想工作的三个问题。
    第一个问题：有人感到形势逼人，也有人不感到形势逼人的问题。我的看法：某些旧高级知识分子，思想上的“框子”是成套的，结合工作上的“规格”和生活上的“规范”，借用一个机械工业上的用语，是“配套”的。“树大遭风”，屏障大了容易吹倒；震动面大了，就不可避免地会时常感到形势逼人。逼得急了，也有人会来一个“化装混过关”，过了关把脸孔一抹，依然故我。这是不起多大作用的。但事情并不严重。我体会党的政策，一面是耐心等待，另一面是加速创造条件。到了有一天，首先在生活方面条件成熟了，先来一个“水到渠成”，让他们通过主要的生活关。目前公共食堂的形势，就是如此。有些人起初因为听到闲言闲语，有些顾虑。后来亲自到食堂里去实践一下，原来真比单独起火多快好省，当场就要求加入了。
    工作“规格”有的可能改动不太大，有的也不必马上改。这样，形势就比较松动了，不那末逼人了。在比较松动的形势下，头脑中的堡垒开放了，思想上的“框子”也全盘显露出来了。经过细致的观察和深入的研究，原来成套的只须拆开来成为个别的“框子”，或者把个别的“框子”再拆开来成为零件和材料，再加以适当的加工改造，就都成为有用的部件、零件和材料。问题的严重只在于构成了框子，而框子又成了套。材料是没有罪过的。分析一下我们的科学文化，分析到最后，可能大部分的材料都是“遗产”。在伟大的时代当中，破铜、烂铁、碎砖、零木都已被搜罗一空，“无用之材”肯定是不大有的了。但碉堡必须拆掉，城墙也要拆掉，阻碍建设、阻碍交通、影响安全的旧建筑，也需要拆掉、搬掉。这当中不但可以拆出来大批的普通材料，而且有时候还可以取到一些珍贵材料。道理就是这样的简单明白，何须大惊小怪？
    不感觉到形势逼人，也没有什么神秘。一种方法，是经常掌握客观形势的发展，思想先行一步，生活如果太高，准备暂时（不过是暂时的）后退一两步。这样，“水未到而闸门先开，风未来而屏障先撤”，逼人的形势失去了被逼的目标，也就无所用其逼了。另一种方法可能是更彻底的。那就是完全信任伟大的毛泽东时代，把一切有关个人利害得失的顾虑忘记得干干净净，把自己放到客观形势的当中去，成为形势的一个组成分子。那就根本不会发生什么逼不逼的问题。
    第二个问题是在大跃进中，特别在参观之后，人们“有动于衷”和“无动于衷”的问题。我认为：“无动于衷”的说法只能适用于文艺写作或普通谈话，用在科学分析上是不恰当的。
  “凡物皆动”，这是从古代朴素的辩证论者到现代的辩证唯物论者都承认的。所以，“无动于衷”的说法是违反辩证唯物主义的。而用“有动”和“无动”来区分人们的思想感情，也是形而上学的。正确的方法是肯定“凡人皆动”，然后再分析种种不同的动的现象和本质。比如，一种是有高度的主人翁自觉的人们，他们经常注视着国家和社会的发展，对于一切新生事物都心中大致了了。他们在参观的时候，经常觉得“好得很”，但并不是完全没有意见；有时情不自禁地提出积极的建议，但绝不以“高明”自居，也不顾虑别人笑你外行；有时也提出善意的批评，但绝不对群众泼冷水。他们会发现许多奇迹，但认为只要深入去了解它们，一切都是可以理解的，并没有什么神秘莫测的神迹。这种人的动是最正常的，也是最普遍的。
    第二种是在“社会主义列车”当中“睡大觉”的人们。他们平时对新事物“熟视无睹”，甚至连报纸都没有耐心去好好地读一遍。他们偶尔出去参观一次，看到那么多陌生的事物，便要“大吃一惊”。这叫做“少见多怪”，也是很自然的。这样大动一下之后，回来可能就再不成天“睡大觉”了，所以也有好处。
    第三种是过去与革命为敌而现在自己的命运掌握在我们的手里的战犯们。他们一般地是“懊悔莫及”的动，但也会有其他不同的类型。
    最后，甚至连美蒋的间谍，假如他们有机会潜入参观的话，也要大动特动。这一般地应该是“惊惶失措”，考虑弃暗投明的动；但也会有个别的“妒恨更深”，力图破坏，反动到底的。
    当然，还会有许许多多的类型，而每一类型之中也还有种种不同的形态。所以，如果有人认为只是简单地用这几个框框或者再加几个框框分别向人们的头上去套，就算做了分析，那在方法上也要犯形而上学的错误，至少是跳过了分析阶段，直接进到综合阶段里去。
    “对具体情况进行具体的分析”，这是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的方法。进行分析的时候，主要地还要根据人们的行动而不仅仅是根据人们的宣言。因此我们说，思想工作是极其复杂细致的工作，不容许有一点点粗枝大叶的作风的。毛主席教导我们要开动脑筋。的确，“改造思想、不动脑筋”的事情是没有的。不动脑筋而俨然以改造者自居的人，更是无比的荒唐！
    第三个问题是大力开展学习毛主席著作的问题。这是天大的好事，是完全符合我的一贯的愿望的。我在多年以来，曾经多次主张：学习马克思列宁主义必须由近及远，由今到古，才比较易于理解和掌握。可是，当时却有人并不那么同意；从我自己来说，也仍然学得很不够，所以还会犯错误。说来也好笑，我读了五十九年的书，近两年来才发觉读书必须做笔记（同时还发觉写文章要争取易稿）。可见，以往之所以没有学好，就因为没有支付足够的辛勤劳动。的确，“科学是老老实实的学问，任何一点调皮都是不行的”。作为一个知识分子，“不读书而求甚解”是不可能的，“不读书、少读书而自命甚解”是危险的；不认真读书是不会有成就的，读书而脱离实践、脱离劳动是极端错误的。
