    Spending the Festival with Relatives
    —A Follow-up Account of Premier Zhou Enlai's Visit to Burma
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Jie Lifu, Yu Minsheng
    High summer has already arrived in Burma, but the Burmese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people far exceed the heat of nature; the fragrant neighboring Buddhist country is blooming with a hundred flowers, all vibrant and colorful, yet the flower of Sino-Burmese friendship is even more splendid. For four days, beside the golden Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, on the bustling streets lined with shops, in the picturesque suburbs and rural villages, and in the busy factories, the "pauk-phaw" (fraternal) friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people has been overflowing everywhere.
    Only a little over three months have passed in 1960, but a glorious and brilliant chapter has already been written in the history of Sino-Burmese relations. At the end of January, just as the Chinese people were celebrating the Spring Festival, former Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win visited our country and signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, advancing Sino-Burmese relations to a new stage and providing a new example of friendship between Asian countries. Today, two months later, just as the Burmese people are celebrating the Water Festival and welcoming the New Year, our Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Prime Minister U Nu, arrived in Burma a day early to celebrate the festival with Burmese friends and to congratulate our friendly neighbors on the New Year. Burmese friends say that this is an auspicious sign of the further consolidation and development of Sino-Burmese friendship.
    Yangon is boiling with the joy of spending the festival with relatives. On April 15, when Premier Zhou arrived at Yangon Airport, the people of Yangon warmly welcomed the distinguished guests visiting Burma, brimming with friendship. On this day, the national flags of China and Burma fluttered at Yangon Airport. The peaceful salute, the flowers of friendship, and the snowflake-like petals, intertwined with the enthusiasm of more than three thousand welcoming masses, formed a moving picture of friendship.
    The scene of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Prime Minister U Nu celebrating the Water Festival together in friendship is deeply etched in the memory of the people of Yangon. On this afternoon, Premier Zhou and the Chinese guests, dressed in Burmese attire, wearing Burmese hats, and Burmese sandals, were indistinguishable as to who were Burmese and who were Chinese. Everyone was a relative, all were "pauk-phaw". Wherever Premier Zhou went, a wave of water-splashing immediately arose, and wherever he went, it turned into a sea of joy, with thunderous applause and shouts of "Sino-Burmese friendship." Some people even shouted "Wishing Premier Zhou Enlai good health" in newly learned Chinese. On the 15th, not only were the streets crowded with people packed like sardines, but the tops of pagodas, rooftops, windows, and tall trees along the streets were also filled with welcoming crowds. In this city with hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands celebrated their biggest traditional festival of the year with Premier Zhou Enlai. Many people splashed the water of friendship on the Chinese guests. Our Premier Zhou Enlai was soaked to the skin, but people kept splashing. Premier Zhou picked up a silver bowl and splashed back at the citizens, repaying friendship with friendship. The clear water of friendship splashed on heads, faces, and bodies, also flowed into people's hearts. The Burmese people will never forget this moment of friendship.
    It is difficult to describe the grand occasion of water-splashing as it actually was. Particularly noteworthy was that the Burmese women, dressed in various gorgeous costumes, enthusiastically performed various graceful Burmese folk dances for the Chinese guests. Those participating in the dance included children of eight or nine years old, young girls, and old ladies in their fifties. Many elderly people who did not like singing and dancing in the past could not help but join the ranks of singing and dancing. One Burmese woman kept singing heartily. She told people: My voice is hoarse, and I haven't sung for several years, but to welcome relatives, I want to sing as much as I can! The Rakhine people also specially performed the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Song" written in their own language to welcome Premier Zhou. They sang enthusiastically: "Welcome guests from afar for your visit, wishing Premier Zhou Enlai a long life, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence shine with golden light. Joint interests are earnestly maintained, we undertake together to defend world peace, Sino-Burmese friendship will last forever, and the people of both countries are filled with joy."
    The Burmese people's warm welcome to the Chinese guests cannot be written or said enough. For several days, from Yangon Airport to the bustling urban area, from ordinary citizens' homes to the Presidential Palace, the national flags of China and Burma could be seen fluttering side by side everywhere. Wherever the Chinese guests passed, the citizens spontaneously stood on both sides, some waving enthusiastically to greet the guests, and some shouting "Sino-Burmese friendship." Our friendship is so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. At a welcome banquet, Burmese artists performed their newly choreographed dance "Flower of Friendship." After the curtain opened, a Chinese woman and a Burmese woman first appeared in the center of the stage. Then a group of Burmese women came out jumping and singing, they sang praises to friendship, they gave flowers to the women of both countries, wishing Sino-Burmese friendship to be as brilliant as flowers. This is a portrayal of the pure hearts of the Burmese people!
    During Premier Zhou's visit to Burma, the leaders of the two countries conducted friendly contacts and heart-to-heart talks. The President of the Union of Burma, U Win Maung, Prime Minister U Nu, and the Chief of Staff of the Defense Forces and former Prime Minister Ne Win, all held welcome banquets for Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou also hosted a luncheon to entertain Burmese leaders and friends from all walks of life. Every gathering of guests and hosts was as harmonious as a family. At the banquet, Premier Zhou frequently raised his glass to congratulate Prime Minister U Nu, the advocate of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the initiator of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, wishing him good health, and wishing good health to former Prime Minister Ne Win, who signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement with China in Beijing. Premier Zhou said: "Mutual visits by those in charge of China and Burma will help consolidate and develop the friendship between the two countries, help mutual understanding, help mutual learning, help mutual exchange of experience and opinions, and help our friendship for generations and generations, forever." At this enthusiastic luncheon, Prime Minister U Nu, in order to express his respect to the Chinese guests, excitedly shouted in fluent Chinese: "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live Premier Zhou Enlai!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Liu Shaoqi!" How could everyone in the audience not applaud enthusiastically for these words of friendship!
    The Burmese media gave a very high evaluation of Premier Zhou's visit. All newspapers in Yangon published news and pictures of Premier Zhou's visit to Burma with banner headlines and in a very prominent position, and the newspapers also published editorials welcoming Premier Zhou's visit to Burma. They all agreed that China and Burma are relatives, "pauk-phaw," and countries that have been living in friendship since ancient times. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression not only embodies the friendly aspirations of the two governments and peoples to adhere to unity, but also creates a new example for the unity and friendship of Asian countries. They believe that Premier Zhou's visit will not only further enhance the friendship between the two peoples, but also make new contributions to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. The "Hanthawaddy" commentary entitled Sino-Burmese Friendship emphasized that China and Burma are countries that advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. According to the Five Principles and the Bandung Conference spirit, the Sino-Burmese border issue, which had been unresolved for more than a hundred years, was successfully resolved. They said that there is no reason why the Sino-Indian border issue cannot be resolved through peaceful consultation.
    However, these grand welcoming scenes and firm words of maintaining peace and friendship made those Western experts who have always hated China feel uneasy. Not long ago, the American propaganda machine was still clamoring: "The Five Principles are dead," "Only China in the world does not want peace." But after all, truth is truth, and slander and libel cannot move a single hair of the great Chinese people. The fact that the Burmese people warmly welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai gave those shameful slanderers a head-on blow. On the very day of the Water Festival, a Western reporter wearing colored glasses still sighed and said: "Such a grand welcome is really unexpected." But a young man standing next to him said: "We feel particularly happy and happy to be able to celebrate the Water Festival with the leaders of our great peaceful neighbor during the festival." This young man spoke the minds of millions of Burmese people.
    The vivid facts of Sino-Burmese friendship show that the Five Principles are not only not outdated, but on the contrary, have more positive content and richer vitality. The imperialist slanders have become worthless in the face of the broad masses of the Burmese people. As U Ba Myint, General Secretary of the Burma Workers' Association, said, let those ill-intentioned imperialists quickly put away their evil deeds! Their conspiracy to create discord in Asia and deliberately undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people will never succeed!
    Now Premier Zhou Enlai has ended his four-day friendly visit to Burma. We believe that with Premier Zhou's visit, the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people will be further developed and consolidated, and the "pauk-phaw" relationship between China and Burma, as close as brothers, will last forever!

    度佳节迎亲人
    ——周恩来总理访缅随行记
    新华社记者　解力夫　于民生
    盛夏已经来到缅甸，但缅甸人民对中国人民满怀友谊的心情远远超过大自然的炎热；芳邻佛国百花竞放，万紫千红，然而，中缅友谊之花比它更加鲜丽。四天以来，在仰光金碧辉煌的大金塔旁，在商店林立的大街上，在风景如画的郊区各农村，在生产忙碌的工厂里，到处洋溢着中缅两国人民“胞波”情谊。
    1960年才过去三个多月，但在中缅关系史上已经写下了光辉灿烂的诗篇。在1月底，正当中国人民欢度春节的时候，缅甸前任总理奈温将军访问我国，并签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，使中缅关系推进到一个新的阶段，为亚洲国家的友好提供了新的范例。两个多月后的今天，正当缅甸人民举国欢度泼水节迎接新年的时候，我国周恩来总理应吴努总理的邀请，提前一天赶到缅甸，和缅甸朋友们欢度佳节，向友好邻居祝贺新年。缅甸朋友们说，这是中缅友谊进一步巩固和发展的吉祥征兆。
    仰光沸腾在度佳节迎亲人的欢乐中。4月15日，当周总理到达仰光机场的时候，仰光市人民热烈地欢迎满载友谊的贵宾来缅甸访问。这一天仰光机场上飘扬着中缅两国国旗。和平的礼炮，友谊的鲜花，雪片似的花瓣同三千多欢迎群众的热情，交织成了一幅动人的友谊的图景。
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和吴努总理一起欢度泼水节的友谊情景，深深地留在仰光人民的记忆中。这一天下午，周总理和中国贵宾们，身穿缅甸装，头带缅甸帽，脚穿缅甸凉鞋，真是分不清谁是缅甸人，谁是中国人，大家都是亲戚，都是“胞波”。周总理走到哪里，哪里就立刻掀起泼水的热潮，哪里就变成欢乐的海洋，暴风雨般的掌声，“中缅友好”的欢呼声震耳欲聋。有些人还用刚学会的中国话喊“祝周恩来总理健康”。15日那一天，不仅大街上拥挤着水泄不通的人群，而且在沿街的塔顶上，楼顶上，窗子上和高树上到处都站满了欢迎的群众。在这个拥有几十万人口的城市里，有几十万人和周恩来总理在一起欢度了他们一年一度的最大的传统的节日。多少人把友谊的水泼到中国贵宾的身上，我们的周恩来总理全身湿透，但是人们还泼个不停，周总理拿起银钵向市民们回泼，用友谊回敬友谊。友谊的清水泼到头上，脸上，身上，也流到人们的心坎里，缅甸人民永远也忘不了这友谊的时刻。
    要如实地描写泼水时的盛况是困难的。特别引人注目的是，穿着各种华丽服装的缅甸妇女，热情奔放地为中国客人们表演了各种优美的缅甸民间舞蹈。参加舞蹈的有八、九岁的小孩，有年轻的姑娘，还有五十多岁的老太太，有许多过去不喜欢歌舞的老年人也情不自禁的加入到歌舞的行列里了。有一位缅甸妇女不断地纵情歌唱，她对人说：我的嗓子哑了，已经几年没有唱歌了，但是为了欢迎亲戚我要尽情的歌唱！若开族人民还特意表演了为欢迎周总理用他们自己的语言所编写的“中缅友好之歌”。他们热情地唱着：“欢迎客人千里迢迢光临访问，祝颂周总理万寿无疆，和平共处五项原则闪金光。共同利益切时维护，保卫世界和平大家承当，中缅友好万古长青，两国人民喜气洋洋。”
    缅甸人民对中国贵宾的热烈欢迎是写不尽说不完的。几天以来，从仰光的飞机场到繁华的市区，从普通的市民住宅到总统府，随处都可以看到中缅两国的国旗并排招展。中国客人所经过的地方，市民们都自发地站在两旁，有的热情招手向客人致意，有的喊“中缅友好”。我们的友谊就是这样的深入人心。在一次欢迎晚会上，缅甸的艺术家们表演了他们新编的舞蹈“友谊之花”。帷幕启开以后，舞台中央首先出现了一位中国妇女和一位缅甸妇女。接着一行缅甸妇女跳着蹦着出来，她们高歌颂友谊，她们把鲜花送给两国妇女，祝中缅友谊像鲜花般的灿烂。这是缅甸人民纯洁心灵的写照！
    在周总理访问缅甸期间，两国的领导人进行了友好的接触和倾心的畅谈，缅甸联邦总统吴温貌，总理吴努和国防军总参谋长、前任总理奈温将军，都为周总理举行了欢迎宴会。周总理也设午宴招待了缅甸领导人和各界朋友们。宾主每一次聚会都像一家人那样融洽。在宴会上周总理频频举杯祝贺和平共处五项原则的倡导者、中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的倡议者吴努总理健康，祝在北京同中国签订中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界协定的前总理奈温将军健康。周总理说：“中缅两国负责人的相互访问将有助于两国友好的巩固和发展，有助于相互了解，有助于相互学习，有助于相互交流经验和意见，有助于我们世世代代子子孙孙的永远友好。”在这热情洋溢的午宴上，吴努总理为了向中国贵宾表示敬意，他激动地用流利的中国话欢呼：“中缅友好万岁！”“周恩来总理万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“刘少奇主席万岁！”全场的人怎能不为这友谊的话语而热烈鼓掌呢！
    缅甸的舆论界，对周总理这次访问给予了很高的评价。仰光所有的报纸都以通栏标题和极为显著的地位刊载了周总理访问缅甸的消息和图片，各报还纷纷发表社论欢迎周总理访问缅甸。它们一致认为，中缅两国是亲戚，是“胞波”，自古以来就是友好相处的国家。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，不仅体现了两国政府和人民坚持团结的友好愿望，而且为亚洲各国的团结友好创造了新的范例。它们相信，周总理的访问，不仅将进一步增进两国人民的友谊，而且为维护亚洲及世界和平将作出新贡献。“罕礁越利报”以中缅友好为题的评论强调说，中缅两国是倡导和平共处五项原则的国家，根据五项原则和万隆会议精神，中缅两国百多年来悬而未决的中缅边界问题，获得了顺利的解决。它们说，中印边界问题没有理由不通过和平协商的方法获得解决。
    然而，这些欢迎的盛况和坚决维护和平友好的话语，却使那些一向仇视中国的西方专家们感到不安。不久以前美国的造谣机器还在叫嚣：“五项原则已经死了”，“世界上只有中国不要和平”。但是，真理毕竟是真理，造谣中伤动不了伟大的中国人民的一根毫毛。缅甸人民热烈欢迎周恩来总理的事实，给那些可耻的诽谤者当头一棒。就在泼水节那一天，一位戴着有色眼镜的西方记者还在感叹地说：“这样盛大的欢迎实在出乎意料。”但是，站在他旁边的一位青年说：“在节日里能和我们伟大的和平邻邦的领导人在一起欢度泼水节，我们感到格外的愉快和幸福。”这位青年道出了千百万缅甸人民心里的话。
    中缅两国友好的生动事实说明：五项原则不但没有过时，相反，却有了更积极的内容和更丰富的生命力。帝国主义的谰言，在缅甸广大人民面前已经变得一钱不值。正如缅甸劳工协会总书记艺波谬敏所说的，让那些不怀好意的帝国主义分子赶快收起他们罪恶的行径吧！他们企图在亚洲制造不和，蓄意破坏中缅两国人民友谊的阴谋是永远也不能得逞的！
    现在周恩来总理已经结束了他在缅甸的四天友好访问。我们相信随着周总理的访问，中缅两国人民的友谊，将获得进一步的发展和巩固，中缅两国亲如手足的“胞波”关系将万古长青！
