Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The National Postal and Telecommunications Technology Performance Competition Conference, recently convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, reviewed the tremendous achievements made by postal and telecommunications workers in the movement, and summarized and coordinated technological innovation projects and advanced experiences. The conference called on the nation's 400,000 postal and telecommunications workers to rapidly promote these innovative achievements and advanced experiences to every corner of the postal and telecommunications departments, launching a new upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the national postal and telecommunications departments, and serving as good "communication soldiers" for the continued leap forward in 1960.

The representatives attending the competition conference exchanged more than 800 advanced experiences, held more than 700 technical performances, and exhibited more than 3,000 kinds of innovative mechanical equipment. Finally, more than 90 sets of advanced experiences were summarized and matched, and the new equipment and tools created in various places are also being identified and matched.

These more than 90 advanced experiences that have been summarized and matched are all relatively complete projects with greater value. For example, the operating experience of telex machine for receiving and sending telegrams in telecommunications work is based on the experience of Pan Zuyong, an advanced telegraph operator from the Guangzhou Telecommunications Bureau, and also incorporates the experience summarized by some advanced telegraph operators from Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and other places. At present, telex machines are widely used in national telecommunications trunk lines for receiving and sending telegrams. Promoting this set of advanced operating experience can ensure that telegrams are received and sent more quickly and accurately, even with the continuous growth of telegram business volume. In terms of postal work, the semi-automatic integrated business counter created by the staff of the Haining County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Zhejiang is a set of integrated business counters that can be widely promoted in county-level post and telecommunications bureaus across the country. This kind of business counter can handle more than a dozen kinds of postal and telecommunications businesses. The work of receiving and sending telegrams, making long-distance calls, subscribing to newspapers and periodicals, and sending and receiving packages are all calculated by instruments; the work of selling stamps, envelopes, stationery, making change, and calculating the talk time of long-distance calls are all controlled by the semi-automatic keys installed on the business counter. Therefore, these businesses, which originally required at least three tellers to complete, can now be competently handled by only one teller.

The National Postal and Telecommunications Technology Performance Competition Conference was convened on the basis of great achievements already made in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments. The task of technological innovation and technological revolution in the postal and telecommunications departments is to reform postal equipment and tools, realize the multiplexing of communication networks, improve communication efficiency, and build a well-connected postal and telecommunications network with modern tools as the mainstay in our country as soon as possible, with the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the center. In the past few months, the scale, speed of development, and effectiveness of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments have been unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions alone, the various innovation proposals realized in the first two months of this year are already equivalent to twice the total for the entire last year.

    以“四化”为中心改革设备工具提高通信效能
    邮电部门总结出九十多套经验
    据新华社26日讯　邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会不久以前召开的全国邮电技术表演比赛大会，检阅了邮电职工在运动中取得的巨大成就，对技术革新项目和先进经验进行了总结、配套。大会号召全国四十万邮电职工，把这些革新成果和先进经验迅速推广到邮电部门的各个角落，在全国邮电部门掀起一个新的技术革新和技术革命运动高潮，为1960年的继续跃进当好“通信兵”。
    参加这次比赛大会的代表，在会上一共交流了八百多项先进经验，举行了七百多次技术表演，展览了三千多种革新的机械设备，最后总结和配成了九十多套先进经验，对各地创制的新设备和新工具也正在进行鉴定和配套的工作。
    这次总结和配套的九十多项先进经验，都是比较完整的、价值较大的项目。例如电信工作方面电传机收发电报的操作经验，是以广州电信局先进报务员潘祖镛的经验为主，又吸收了上海、北京、重庆等地一些先进报务员的经验总结出来的。目前全国电信干线已经普遍使用电传机收发电报，推广这一套先进操作经验，就可以保证在电报业务量不断增长的情况下，又多又快地收发电报，不出差错。在邮政工作方面，浙江海宁县邮电局职工创造的半自动化综合营业台，是一套可以在全国县级邮电局中普遍推广的综合营业柜台。这种营业台能够经营十几种邮电业务，收发电报、打长途电话、收订报刊、收寄包裹等工作，全部由仪表计算费用；出售邮票、信封、信纸、找零钱和计算长途电话的通话时间等工作，都由营业台上安装的半自动化的电键控制；因此，原来至少需要三个营业员才能办完的这些业务，现在只需要一个营业员就能胜任了。
    全国邮电技术表演比赛大会，是在邮电部门技术革新和技术革命运动已经取得了很大成就的基础上召开的。邮电部门技术革新和技术革命的任务是，以实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心，改革邮电设备工具，实现通信网路的多路化，提高通信效能，尽快地在我国建成一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网。几个月来，邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，范围之广、发展之快、收效之大，都是前所未有的。仅据十七个省、市、自治区的不完全统计，今年头两个月实现的各种革新建议，已经相当于去年全年总和的两倍。
