Comrades,

We support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. We firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the correct instructions of Chairman Mao, and the joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the country, holding high the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will certainly be able to overcome any difficulties in our progress, fulfill and over fulfill the 1960 national budget serving the sustained Great Leap Forward of the national economy, and over fulfill the 1960 national economic plan, and certainly be able to continue the Great Leap Forward more, faster, better, and more economically.

Like all of you, we have come to this meeting from our work areas with immense excitement. At the meeting, we were honored to see Chairman Mao and listen to the reports of the Party and state leaders. We are honored to live in this great Mao Zedong era and country, where the brilliance of socialism and communism shines everywhere. Every place and every industry is creating inspiring miracles and countless heroic figures.

Please allow us to report here to everyone one of the countless heroic deeds that have occurred in our People's Republic of China in the 1960s: a heroic event in Yingde County, Guangdong Province. This incident occurred on February 26th of this year. The Maokou Paper Mill in Yingde County, Guangdong, caught fire. The brave police and cadres of Yingde County, in order to save state property and their class brothers trapped in the sea of fire, disregarded their personal safety, bravely fought the raging fire, repeatedly fell and rose, repeatedly entered and exited the fire, determined to rescue state property and their dear class brothers. Twelve good sons and daughters of the Party and Chairman Mao, including Ma Delin and Su Manji, heroically sacrificed themselves on the spot! Dozens of other comrades were injured. After this incident occurred, thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and masses, men and women, crowded hospitals and streets, vying to donate blood to the injured comrades. The central government dispatched planes to transport plasma to the hospital, and all parts of the country immediately provided rapid and enthusiastic assistance. Party committees, military units, health, aviation, railway, transportation, and other departments across the country accelerated their mobilization to help with the rescue work and overcome many difficulties. There was also the younger brother, not yet twenty years old, of the hero Su Manji, who sacrificed himself heroically, who accompanied his heroic mother to request the local leaders to fill the vacancy of his gloriously sacrificed brother's police post, to inherit his brother's ambition, to be a good son and daughter of Mao Zedong, to serve the people.

From this great and heroic event, it can be seen that under the teachings of the great Party and Chairman Mao, the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people has undergone great changes. Whether old or young, male or female, from leaders to the masses, in relationships between people and between events, they can all demonstrate the class brotherhood, friendship, and unity, and the noble communist spirit of selfless devotion to the Party and the country! The heroic deeds of the "Maokou Incident" have indeed deeply moved and educated us. Our Guangdong Yue Opera Troupe quickly sent comrades to Yingde, to the hospitals treating the injured heroes, and to the homes of the heroes, to conduct cordial visits on the one hand, and to request, through extensive contact and in-depth understanding, to quickly adapt this heroic event into a Yue Opera, so that these heroes could quickly appear on the stage through artistic images, to better inspire the broad masses and better educate the broad masses.

Under the inspiration and education of the "Maokou Incident," we immediately mobilized the masses, consulted experts, strived for the best, mustered our energy, and worked hard for five days and nights, composing and rehearsing the new play "Ode to the Heroes of Maokou," which was first brought to the stage and met with the broad audience by the Fifth Troupe under our academy. This deeply moving drama, full of communist moral style, was a hit as soon as it was released, with full houses and crowds queuing to buy tickets. Countless people were unable to get tickets, causing a sensation throughout Guangzhou. After seeing the play, the audience was deeply moved. Even the old men and women said with emotion, "The people educated in communism today are truly remarkable. Seeing them disregard their own lives to save state property and the lives of others, this kind of great selfless spirit, we had never even heard of it in the old society. It is truly moving and admirable. Through continuous education, we have come to realize the incorrectness of the past. For decades, we have worshiped Guan Yunchang, who privately released the enemy, surrendered to the enemy, served the enemy, and killed Yan Liang and Wen Chou. Today, we will no longer be fooled by him." From this, it can be seen how great a role "Ode to the Heroes of Maokou" plays in educating the masses.

After the Fifth Troupe of the Guangdong Yue Opera Troupe performed "Ode to the Heroes of Maokou," the First, Second, and Third Troupes also rushed to rehearse at the same time, striving to bring this good play, with higher quality, to various special zones and provinces in the province in the near future for touring performances, striving to meet with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition to the various performance units under our academy, Yue Opera troupes in central Guangdong are also rushing to adapt this new play reflecting modern heroic events. The entire Yue Opera community has already set off a heatwave of competing to perform the heroes of Maokou on stage. We deeply feel that through this performance of the "Maokou Incident," not only has our thinking been greatly improved, but we have also gained a lot of experience from modern life in art, thereby enriching our skills in performing modern plays on stage. From this adaptation and performance of "Ode to the Heroes of Maokou," we feel that the concerns we had in the past about how to adapt and perform plays reflecting modern life were mainly due to the issue of ideological transformation, that is, the issue of what worldview to use to view our work. If our Yue Opera workers had not undergone a series of ideological transformations, especially last year's anti-Rightist campaign and the gradual learning of the proletarian worldview, putting politics in command, and liberating our minds, then such a great heroic deed as Xiang Xiuli risking her life to save state property and protect the safety of the people could not have been brought to the stage in time, allowing ourselves to be educated and the masses to be educated. This is because we have the leadership of the Party, we rely on the leadership of the Party, and we have gained experience and achieved the success of "Ode to the Heroes of Maokou." Of course, it is not to say that we are satisfied with the achievements we have already made, but we must affirm our achievements and gradually improve and make it a better drama to serve the people.

We believe that in the great Mao Zedong era, in our great socialist motherland, under the leadership of our great, wise Party and Chairman Mao, the most ordinary people will also become heroes in the revolutionary cause and create miracles. As long as we can sincerely rely on the Party and believe in our great, wise Party and leader, they will surely lead us along the broad road of socialism and stride faster towards a happy and ideal communist society!

### 数英雄人物还看今朝  马师曾和邝健廉（红线女）委员的联合发言

    数英雄人物还看今朝
    马师曾和邝健廉（红线女）委员的联合发言各位委员：
    我们拥护李富春和李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，我们坚决相信中国有中国共产党的英明领导、毛主席的正确指示和全国各族人民的共同努力，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线，大跃进和人民公社，我们就一定能够克服前进当中的任何困难，完成和超额完成为国民经济持续跃进服务的1960年的国家预算，和超额地完成1960年的国民经济计划，一定能够更加多快好省地继续大跃进。
    我们跟在座的各位委员一样，都是从自己的工作地区，带着无比兴奋的心情前来开会的。我们在会场上很光荣地看到了毛主席，听取了党和国家领导同志的报告，我们很荣幸生活在这伟大的毛泽东时代和国家里，到处都闪耀着社会主义和共产主义的光辉，每一个地方，每一种行业都在创造出振奋人心的奇迹和无数英雄人物。
    请让我们在这里向大家报告，六十年代我们中华人民共和国出现无数英雄事例之一，是我们广东省英德县的一件英雄事迹。此事发生在今年2月26日，我们广东英德县马口造纸厂失火，我们英德县的英勇民警和干部，为了抢救国家财产，为了抢救身陷火海中的阶级兄弟，他们把个人生死置诸度外，奋不顾身地与烈火搏斗，在火场中屡仆屡起，屡进屡出，一心要把国家财产和亲爱的阶级兄弟抢救出来。当场壮烈牺牲的有马德林、苏满基等十二位党和毛泽东的好儿女！还有几十位同志负了伤。此事发生之后，整千整百的工、农、兵、学生、群众男男女女，挤满了医院和街道，争先要求输血给负伤的同志们，中央派出了飞机输送血浆到医院去，全国各地都纷纷马上给予迅速热情的援助，各地党委和部队、卫生、航空、铁道、运输等部门都加快地总动员起来，帮助此次的救护工作，克服了许多困难。还有那壮烈牺牲的英雄苏满基同志的未满二十岁的弟弟，陪伴着他英雄的母亲去要求当地领导，要补上他已光荣牺牲的哥哥的民警岗位遗额，要继承他哥哥的壮志，要做一个毛泽东的好儿女，来为人民服务。
    从这件伟大而英雄的事看来，在伟大的党和毛主席教导下，中国人民精神面貌有了伟大的变化，无论是老的、少的、男的、女的，从领导上以至于群众，在人与人之间，事与事之间，都能表现出阶级兄弟的友爱和团结，为党为国，公而忘私的崇高共产主义风格！这“马口事件”的英雄事迹，的确深深感动和教育了我们。我们广东粤剧院很快就派了同志到英德去，进到治疗负伤英雄的医院中去，进到英雄们的家里去，一方面进行亲切的慰问，一方面还要求通过广泛的接触和深入的了解而尽快地把这一英雄事件编成粤剧，通过艺术形象使这些英雄们，能够迅速出现在舞台上，更好地激励广大群众，更好地教育广大群众。
    我们在“马口事件”的感动和教育下，马上发动群众，请教专家，力争上游，鼓足干劲，多快好省地苦战五个昼夜，连编带排，于是“马口英雄赞”这一部新戏便由我院辖下的第五团首先搬上舞台和广大的观众见面了。这一感人最深，充满共产主义道德风格的剧目一挂出来，场场满座，人山人海排队争购戏票，人人以先看为快，那额满见遗的人不计其数，哄动了整个广州。观众看了此戏之后，大受感动，连那些老公公和老太婆们都感动地说，在今天共产主义教育出来的人真了不起，看他们为了抢救国家财产，为了抢救别人的生命，竟不顾自己的死生，这种伟大忘我的精神，在旧社会里，我们听也未曾听过，真是使人感动和崇拜，在不断的教育中，使我们认识到过去的不正确；几十年来崇拜那私放敌人，投降敌人，为敌人效力而杀死颜良、文丑的关云长，我们今天再不上他的当了。于此可以看到“马口英雄赞”对群众教育是起了多么大的作用。
    我们广东粤剧院第五团演出“马口英雄赞”之后，继而第一团、第二团、第三团也同时赶排，争取以更高的质量把这个好戏，在最近期间，分头带到省内各专区和各省去作巡回演出，争取同广大的工农兵群众见面。还有除我院辖下各个演出单位，粤中的各粤剧团体也正纷纷在赶快编排这个反映现代英雄事件的新戏，现在整个粤剧界都已经掀起了在舞台上争着献演马口英雄的热潮。我们深深感到通过这次“马口事件”的演出，不单只在思想得到了很大的提高，在艺术上也取得了很多现代生活里的经验，从而丰富了我们在舞台表演现代戏的技巧。从这次编演“马口英雄赞”使得我们感觉到过去对如何编演反映现代生活剧目中产生的顾虑，主要原因是思想改造的问题，这就是说，用什么世界观去看待我们的工作的问题。如果我们粤剧工作者不是经过一系列的思想改造，特别是去年的反右倾和逐步学习无产阶级世界观，政治挂帅、解放思想，那么发生了向秀丽为了抢救国家资财，保护人民安全这么伟大的英雄事迹，能够及时地把这个现代的英雄人物搬到舞台上来，使自己受到教育，群众受到教育。这是由于我们有党的领导，我们是依靠党的领导，吸取了经验而取得“马口英雄赞”的成绩。当然不是说我们就满足了已取得的成绩，但是我们要肯定我们的成绩而逐步提高改进，使之成为更好的剧目为人民服务。
    我们相信在伟大的毛泽东时代，在我们伟大的社会主义祖国，在我们伟大英明的党和毛主席的领导下，最平凡的人，也将会成为革命事业中的英雄创造出奇迹的。只要我们能真心诚意依靠党，相信我们伟大英明的党和领袖，必能领导着我们沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进，更快地奔向幸福理想的共产主义社会去！
