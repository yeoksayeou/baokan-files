Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A mass movement to achieve coal gasification at high speed is being launched in the national light industry system.

Coal gasification means that coal is first turned into gas, and then the gas is used to burn boilers, kilns, stoves, or to power internal combustion engines, etc. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Light Industry, if the national light industry system were to fully realize coal gasification, with a 20% reduction in coal consumption, the country could save six million tons of coal annually. If this experience is promoted in all industries across the country, 400 million tons of coal can be used as 500 million tons. This is a major event in the national economy.

In order to lead this technical revolution movement, the Ministry of Light Industry and the All-China Light Industry Trade Union National Committee established a joint command on April 1st and issued a notice requiring the national light industry system to “learn from Shandong and catch up with Shandong,” and to engage in coal gasification with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking. The Ministry of Light Industry, the All-China Light Industry Trade Union National Committee, and the Shandong Provincial Department of Light Industry have jointly organized more than twenty technical promotion teams to go to nineteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Xinjiang and Ningxia to assist in carrying out the coal gasification movement. Coal gasification movement headquarters of the light industry systems in Shandong, Jiangsu, Qinghai, Jilin, and other provinces have also been established successively.

The coal gasification movement was first started at the Zibo Ceramics Factory in Shandong. At present, the scope of coal gas utilization in Shandong Province has rapidly expanded from the ceramics and glass industries to the textile, food, chemical industries, and some heavy industrial production sectors; 7,000 coal gas generators have been established in various industries throughout the province. In Jiangsu Province, more than 50% of boilers, enamel kilns, and ceramic kilns have been converted to burn gas. In Hebei Province, 88% of kilns have achieved coal gasification and semi-coal gasification, and the scope of coal gasification has been extended to glass, food, oil, and brewing industries. Light industrial factories in Xining City, Qinghai Province, have basically achieved coal gasification. Light industrial factories in various places can build a small coal gas generator within three to five days using only some refractory bricks and a small amount of steel. The method is simple and easy to implement, and the effect is extremely significant, unlike foreign coal gasification, which has a relatively small scope of application due to limitations in technology, equipment, and conditions. Its scope of application is becoming wider and wider, not only can it be used by light industrial factories, but also can be promoted in some heavy industrial factories; not only can it be used by factories and enterprises, but also can be promoted in office heating rooms and public canteens.

According to the advanced experience of Zibo Ceramics Factory and Shandong Province's light industry system in promoting coal gasification, the Ministry of Light Industry has summarized ten major benefits of coal gasification. The main ones are: achieving coal gasification can generally save about 30% of coal; inferior coal can be used instead of high-quality coal to generate gas; a large amount of transportation capacity can be saved; liquid fuels can be replaced to power internal combustion engines; labor can be saved by 50% to 60%; chemical raw materials can be extracted, opening up broad avenues for the comprehensive utilization of coal; labor safety and hygiene conditions are greatly improved; after the ceramic and glass industries switch to using gas, the equipment utilization rate is significantly improved due to the shortening of firing time, which can both increase production and improve product quality. Workers in all factories that have achieved coal gasification are delighted. Some workers said that in the past, entering the boiler room in white clothes was like sending white clothes to a dyeing workshop; today, with the realization of coal gasification, everyone is changing into new clothes. Some said: In the past, the fire hook was always in hand, and legs were sore and back ached; since the realization of coal gasification, the fire hook is unemployed and people are at ease.

### 节约煤炭  综合利用煤炭  促进生产大发展  轻工业系统开展煤气化运动  轻工业部等组织二十多个技术推广队分赴各地协助工作

    节约煤炭  综合利用煤炭  促进生产大发展
    轻工业系统开展煤气化运动
    轻工业部等组织二十多个技术推广队分赴各地协助工作
    新华社讯　一个高速度实现煤气化的群众运动正在全国轻工业系统开展起来。
    所谓煤气化，就是使煤炭先变成煤气，然后用煤气去烧锅炉、烧窑、烧炉灶或发动内燃机等。据轻工业部初步估计，如果全国轻工业系统全部实现煤气化，以节煤20％计算，全年就可以为国家节省六百万吨煤。这个经验如果在全国各行业都推广，四亿吨煤就可以当五亿吨使用。这是国民经济中的一件大事。
    轻工业部和中国轻工业工会全国委员会为了领导这一技术革命运动，已在4月1日成立联合指挥部，并发出通知，要求全国轻工业系统
  “学山东、赶山东”，以大炼钢铁的精神，大搞煤气化。轻工业部、中国轻工业工会全国委员会和山东轻工业厅已共同组织二十多个技术推广队，前往新疆、宁夏等十九个省市自治区，协助开展煤气化运动。山东、江苏、青海、吉林等省轻工业系统煤气化运动指挥部也已相继成立。
    煤气化运动，是首先在山东淄博瓷厂开始的。目前，山东省利用煤气的范围，已经从陶瓷、玻璃行业，迅速扩大到纺织、食品、化学工业及某些重工业生产部门；全省各行业已建立煤气发生炉七千座。江苏省已有50％以上的锅炉、搪瓷窑和陶瓷窑改烧煤气。河北省已有88％的窑炉实现煤气化和半煤气化，煤气化范围已推广到玻璃、食品、油脂、酿酒等行业。青海西宁市轻工业工厂已基本实现煤气化。各地轻工业工厂只用一些耐火砖和少量钢材，在三、五天之内就能建成一个小型煤气发生炉。办法简单易行，效果极为显著，不像洋法煤气化，因受技术设备和条件的限制，运用范围比较小。它的运用范围越来越广，不仅轻工业工厂可用，某些重工业工厂也可推广；不仅工厂企业可用，机关暖气房、公共食堂也可推广。
    轻工业部根据淄博瓷厂和山东省轻工业系统推广煤气化的先进经验，总结出煤气化有十大好处。主要的有：实现煤气化，一般能省煤30％左右；能用劣质煤代替优等煤发生煤气；能节约大量运输力；可以代替一部分液体燃料开动内燃机；可节省劳动力50％到60％；可以提取化工原料，为煤的综合利用开辟广阔道路；劳动安全和卫生条件大大改善；陶瓷玻璃工业改用煤气以后，因烧成时间缩短，设备利用率显著提高，既能增加产量，又能提高产品质量。凡是已经实现煤气化的工厂，工人莫不欢欣鼓舞。有的工人说，过去穿白衣进锅炉房，好比白衣送染房；今天实现煤气化，人人换上新衣裳。有的说：过去火钩不离手，腿又痛来腰又酸；自从实现煤气化，火钩失业人清闲。
