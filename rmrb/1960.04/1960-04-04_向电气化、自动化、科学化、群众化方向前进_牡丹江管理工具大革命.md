Advancing towards Electrification, Automation, Scientific Management, and Mass Participation
Mudanjiang's Management Tool Revolution

    (By our newspaper) Mudanjiang has formed a high tide of management innovation centered on large-scale development of rapid calculation tools and electrified and automated management tools during the mass movement of technological innovation and revolution. According to incomplete statistics, in January and February this year, the city created 246 kinds of special-purpose rapid calculation tools and electrified and automated management tools suitable for production in various industries and trades, totaling more than 7,500 pieces.

      Scientific Management Tools
    In this city where the flowers of technological innovation are blooming, a novel scene of enterprise management work has appeared: weighing, measuring, and counting money without hands; communicating and reporting numbers without speaking; cards not needing to be pulled; transmission not needing to be walked. In the cement factory, management cadres can be seen sitting in the dispatch room equipped with a self-made electrified production scheduling automatic control console, where they can understand the product output, quality, and equipment operation of all eight workshops and six main engines, as well as the cement in-and-out of the six cement warehouses every minute and every second to direct production. The city's workers have created systematic, complete sets of tools for comprehensively innovating enterprise management work. For example, in production management, there are various instruments for automatic reporting, communication, checking weight, checking length, checking quality, measuring temperature, and controlling equipment operation, as well as various rapid calculation tools, universal cards, and rapid calculation tables for output, quality, and time quotas. In technical management, there are sulfur removal rapid calculation devices for analyzing steel quality, rapid calculation discs, universal cards, and rapid calculation tables for converting complex process formulas. Among the tools for reforming financial management work, there are rapid calculation discs, rapid calculation rulers, rapid calculation cards, and rapid calculation devices for calculating various economic indicators; rapid calculation devices and rapid calculation rulers for eight-level wages, supplementary wages, quota wages, and more than thirty levels of daily and hourly wages; rapid calculation devices for calculating attendance rates, consumption quotas, costs, and labor productivity; automatic money counting, "finding" coins, drawing cards, and printing machines. For example, the serial number finder created by the cement factory can automatically organize and retrieve various cards used for management tools, materials, and wages. If management personnel need a certain card, they only need to press the Arabic numerals on the serial number finder according to the card's number, and that card will immediately pop out of the serial number finder. After use, the card is thrown into the serial number finder, and the serial number finder automatically organizes the cards in sequence. Now, the units applying and creating these tools have gone beyond the scope of industrial enterprises. Medical departments have also created calculators for women's pregnancy periods, canteens have created rapid calculation discs for dispensing rice per person and rapid calculation devices for calculating water, electricity, coal, and gas, and livestock farms have created feed rapid calculation discs and rapid calculation devices for feeding pigs and chickens.

      Management Level Has Been Improved
    These management tools created by the masses have five characteristics: fast, timely, accurate, easy to learn, and applicable. Therefore, they have played a great role in improving the level and efficiency of management work to adapt to the leap-forward development of productive forces, and in consolidating and developing the system of workers participating in management and cadres participating in labor. According to a survey by the cement factory, the 36 types of new management tools, totaling 840 pieces, used by the factory have increased work efficiency by an average of ten times compared with the old methods, prompting the factory's management work to a new level, from being able to only grasp daily output in the past to grasping hourly output; from analyzing production costs once a month in the past to settling accounts every shift and analyzing them daily. It has completely changed the situation of cost overruns at the beginning of the year caused by being unaware of production costs, and over-fulfilled the cost reduction plan for January and February this year.

    It is more convenient for workers to participate in management
    Some workers in Mudanjiang City with low levels of education used to have some difficulties in participating in enterprise management and doing economic analysis. The workers said: "We are not afraid of being tired, not afraid of being annoyed, just afraid of bookkeeping and calculating with an abacus." Now the rapid calculation tools created by the masses are easy to learn and understand. As long as you recognize Arabic numerals, you can learn a calculation method for a certain business in a few minutes. Even businesses such as wages, labor productivity, costs, and complex production formulas, which were previously considered that workers could not manage, can now be managed by workers, and managed very well. For example, the calculation work of calculating the amount of rubber used for various types of rubber sheets in the second workshop of the rubber factory requires 140,000 conversions, and the calculation method is extremely complicated. For ten years since the factory was built, only one professional could calculate it. Now the workers have created a desktop rotary rapid calculation device, and some workers can also calculate. According to a survey, before the promotion of new management tools, a "comprehensive staff member" (responsible for calculating the completion of various indicators of the group) who participated in enterprise management would spend one and a half hours of spare time to handle the day's business. Now it only takes 20 minutes.

    Cadres have more time to go deep into the grassroots
    The widespread innovation of management work tools has liberated management cadres from the heavy pile of numerical calculations, thus solving the contradiction between management cadres participating in labor and business work in the past. Now, management personnel in general enterprises only need two or three hours a day to handle their calculation business. Most of the remaining time can be spent going deep into the work teams, participating in labor or handling problems. The innovation of management work tools has also promoted socialist labor competition. Because the new management tools can reflect production results in a timely and accurate manner, workers can know their own and their competitors' production status at any time, so it greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of the workers to catch up with each other. The leadership can also carry out propaganda and mobilization and conduct evaluations more timely than before to promote the continuous leap forward of production.

    向电气化、自动化、科学化、群众化方向前进
    牡丹江管理工具大革命
    本报讯　牡丹江是在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，形成了一个以大搞速算工具和电气化自动化管理工具为中心的管理工作大革新的高潮。据不完全的统计，今年1、2月份全市共创造了二百四十六种共七千五百多件适合各行业各工种生产用的专用速算工具和电气化自动化管理工具。
      科学的管理工具
    在这个技术革新花朵盛开的城市，出现了新奇的企业管理工作的景象：称斤、量尺、点钞不用手，通讯报数不用口，卡片不用抽，传递不用走。在水泥厂，可以看到管理干部坐在设有自制的电气化生产调度自动控制台的调度室里，每分钟每秒钟都可以了解全厂八个车间和六大主机的产品产量、质量、设备运转的情况，以及六个水泥库的水泥出库入库的情况，来指挥生产。全市职工已创造了系统的、成套的用于全面革新企业管理工作的工具。例如，在生产管理方面，有自动报数、传讯、检查重量、检查长短、检查质量、测温度和控制设备运转的各种仪器，有各种各样的产量、质量和工时定额速算盘，生产进度指示钟、指示板和报数牌等。在技术管理方面，有分析钢铁质量的除硫速算器，换算复杂工艺配方的速算盘、万能卡和速算表等。在革新财务管理工作的工具中，有核算各种经济指标的速算盘、速算尺、速算卡、速算器，有八级工资、附加工资、定额工资以及三十余级的分日分时的工资速算器和速算尺，计算出勤率、消耗定额、成本和劳动生产率的速算器，自动点钞、“找”硬币、抽卡片和打印等等的机械。例如，水泥厂创造的查号器，能自动地整理和查取管理工具、材料和工资等用的各种卡片。管理人员要用哪一张卡片，只要按照卡片的编号按动查号器上的阿拉伯字码，那张卡片就立刻从查号器里钻出来，用完以后，把卡片扔进查号器里，查号器又自动地把卡片依次整理好了。现在，应用和创造这类工具的单位，已超越了工业企业的范围。医务部门也创造了妇女妊娠期的计算器，食堂创制了按人下米的速算盘和计算用水、电、煤和煤气的速算器，畜牧场创造了喂猪喂鸡用的饲料速算盘和速算器。
      管理水平提高了
    这些群众创造的管理工具，具有五个特点：快速、及时、准确、易学、适用。因此对提高管理工作的水平和效率以适应生产力的飞跃发展，对于巩固和发展工人参加管理、干部参加劳动的制度，都起了很大的作用。据水泥厂的调查，这个厂运用的三十六种共八百四十件新的管理工具，平均比用旧方法的工作效率提高了十倍，促使这个厂的管理工作提高到了一个新的水平，由过去只能掌握日产量，做到了掌握每小时的产量；由过去1月分析一次生产成本，做到了每班结算、每日分析。彻底改变了由于对生产成本心中无数造成历年年初成本超支的情况，超额完成了今年1、2月降低成本的计划。
    工人参加管理更方便了
    牡丹江市有些文化程度低的工人，过去在参加企业管理作经济分析工作有些困难。工人说：“不怕累，不怕烦，就怕记账打算盘。”现在群众创造的速算工具，易学易懂，只要认识阿拉伯字码，用几分钟就可以学会一种业务的计算方法。就连过去被人认为工人不能管理的工资、劳动生产率、成本、复杂的生产配方等业务，工人现在也能管理，而且管理得很好。例如橡胶厂二车间计算各种型号胶片用胶量的计算工作，要换算十四万次，计算方法也极为复杂。建厂十年来全厂只有一个专业人员能计算。现在职工们创造了一个台式回转速算器，有些工人也能计算了。据调查，推广新的管理工具以前，一个参加企业管理工作的工人“综合大员”（负责核算本组各种指标完成的情况）处理完当天的业务，要占一个半小时的业余时间，现在只用二十分钟。
    干部深入基层的时间更多了
    广泛的革新管理工作的工具，使管理干部从繁重的数字计算堆里解放出来，从而解决了过去管理干部参加劳动和业务工作的矛盾。现在，一般企业的管理人员，每天只用两、三小时就可以处理完自己的计算业务。剩下的大部分时间就可以深入班组，参加劳动或处理问题。革新管理工作的工具，也促进了社会主义劳动竞赛。由于新的管理工具能及时、准确的反映生产成果，工人都能随时知道自己和竞赛对方的生产情况，所以就大大激发了工人群众你追我赶的积极性。领导方面也比以前能更及时的进行宣传鼓动和进行评比，来促进生产的持续跃进。
