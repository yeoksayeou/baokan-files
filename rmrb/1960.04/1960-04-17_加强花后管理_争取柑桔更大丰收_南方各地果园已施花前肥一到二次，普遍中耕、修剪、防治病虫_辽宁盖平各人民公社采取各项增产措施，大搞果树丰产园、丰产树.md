Southern Orchards Have Applied Pre-Flowering Fertilizer Once or Twice, Generally Deep-Tilled, Pruned, and Controlled Pests and Diseases
Liaoning Gaiping People's Communes Adopt Various Measures to Increase Production, Vigorously Develop High-Yield Orchards and High-Yield Trees

(Reported by this newspaper) Lush branches and leaves, citrus blossoms in full bloom, orchards in southern China are currently presenting a vibrant spring scene. To strive for a continued leap forward in fruit production this year, various regions are focusing on citrus as a priority, strengthening post-flowering cultivation management. Currently, most orchards have applied pre-flowering fertilizer once, some twice, and have generally carried out deep tillage, pruning, and pest and disease control.

In 1959, fruit production in southern China achieved a bumper harvest. According to statistics from eleven provinces (regions) and one special district, including Guangdong, Hunan, and Zhejiang, fruit production in 1959 continued to increase compared to 1958. To strive for an even greater harvest this year, since last winter, local Party committees, based on the principle of "taking grain as the key link, developing diversified operations in an all-round way," have strengthened the leadership of fruit production. On the one hand, they unified planning and rationally arranged fruit production according to local conditions, and on the other hand, they established and improved fruit production organizations, assigning dedicated personnel at all levels to be responsible. Huang Jiaxin, secretary of the Jiangjin County Party Committee in Sichuan Province, and others went deep into the Gaoya Management Area of the Gaoya Commune to focus on key tasks, creating experience in early fertilization, early pruning, and early pest control. Subsequently, the County Party Committee held an on-site meeting here to promote it. Driven by the County Party Committee, the fertilization time throughout the county was advanced by one month; 80% of the 18,500 mu of citrus have been fertilized once, of which one-third have been fertilized twice, with about one dan of refined fertilizer applied to each plant. According to incomplete statistics, cadres and commune members throughout the county have planted 347 mu of citrus experimental fields.

The experience of the two great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 in southern China proves that preserving flowers and fruits is an important link in ensuring abundant fruit harvests. Currently, citrus, banana, and other fruit-producing areas are seizing the opportunity, focusing on preserving flowers and fruits, vigorously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and strengthening orchard management. Many areas have achieved abundant fertilizer, sufficient water, thick soil cultivation, and thorough pest and disease control in orchard management. Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, applied fertilizer to citrus orchards two and a half times this year, more than one time more than last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied also increased by more than 50% compared to last year. Xupu County, Hunan Province, which achieved a large-scale citrus harvest last year, is further applying the experience of intercropping green manure in citrus orchards and raising pigs in citrus orchards this year to increase fertilizer accumulation. The county intercropped 3,720 mu of green manure in the 4,513 mu of fruit-bearing citrus orchards and raised 4,000 pigs in the citrus orchards. Due to the large number of pigs and fertilizer, by the end of February, an average of more than 100 dan of fertilizer had been applied per mu, an increase of about 15% compared to the same period last year.

To improve fruit production, various regions, under the guidance of the principle of "taking grain as the key link, developing diversified operations in an all-round way," have unified the arrangement of labor, and generally established and improved professional teams to be responsible for routine cultivation management. The number of fruit production professional teams in Sichuan Province has increased from 483 last year to 920, and the number of team members has increased from 6,284 to more than 18,000. Some professional teams implement "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing cost) and "one reward," further stimulating the enthusiasm of commune members and promoting cultivation management work. The Cai Keng Brigade of the Jiuhu Commune in Fujian Province, based on the age, size, and growth strength of fruit trees, contracted the 727 mu of citrus to professional teams for management in three types. Due to the adoption of this method, the commune members' enthusiasm has been even greater, and they have now applied two applications of human manure and urine, one more application than last year; there was no soil cultivation last year, but this year 400 to 600 dan of soil have been cultivated per mu.

While grasping the cultivation management of existing orchards, various regions are giving full play to the great advantages of the people's communes, using barren mountains, barren slopes, riverbanks, and roadsides to concentrate on establishing new orchards in patches. In Sichuan Province alone, the number of commune and team horticultural farms has increased from 15 last year to 319, and the area has increased from 3,000 mu to 50,000 mu. From August last year to January this year, Yulin County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region mobilized 850,000 person-times throughout the county, realizing that every commune and team in the county has a "Flower and Fruit Mountain."

(Reported by this newspaper) In Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, the "hometown of apples," while engaging in high-yield fields, high-yield mountains, and high-yield rivers, people's communes are vigorously developing high-yield orchards and high-yield trees, vowing to win a great apple harvest this year.

Due to the adoption of production-increasing measures and the strengthening of cultivation management, the total apple production in Gaiping County has been increasing year by year. Last year, the total output reached 60,000 tons, an increase of 20% compared to the great leap forward year of 1958. To achieve an even greater harvest this year, cadres and masses in Gaiping County are carrying out spring orchard management work based on the "Eight Major Reforms" for fruit production they have formulated (changing barren land into fertile soil, improving fertilization methods, changing irrigation for "life-saving water" to timely watering, changing three years to cultivate seedlings to one or two years, changing sparse planting, sparse branches, and sparse fruits to preserving flowers and fruits, changing regular prevention and control to symptomatic prevention and control, changing single fruits to giving equal importance to fruits and dried fruits, changing small-area high-yield orchards to large-area high-yield orchards).

Encouraged by the call of the County Party Committee "Do not prune in March," the spring pruning of fruit trees by the vast number of fruit tree technicians and technical experts in Gaiping County was one month earlier than in previous years. By the end of February, all tasks had been completed, pruning 2 million fruit-bearing trees and 1.9 million small trees.

While pruning, the fruit tree communes also launched a mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases. In this spring's pest and disease control, all communes further implemented the principle of "prevention is more important than cure, joint prevention and joint treatment," and all communes and teams established technical organizations and observation and forecasting points. By March 10, apple trees throughout the county had generally been scraped manually once or twice, sweeping away the germs, insect eggs, and larvae that have harmed fruit trees over the years. This year's pest control also started one month earlier than in previous years.

To strengthen the management of fruit production, Party committee secretaries at all levels are taking charge of this production this year. Wei Min, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, personally grasped fruit production and went deep into the fruit tree high-yield orchard of Tangtun Production Team of Xiongyue People's Commune to participate in production and lead production. Because two Party committee secretaries took charge of Jiuzhai Commune and conducted experimental fields in the fruit tree orchard, the fruit tree management of this commune was strengthened. This year, each fruit tree here applied 200 jin more of manure than last year, added 2 jin of chemical fertilizer, and also carried ice and diverted water to the mountains to water the fruit trees as early as February 10. Currently, the spring breeze is blowing and the fruit trees are sprouting. Commune members throughout the county are loosening the soil and spraying medicine on the fruit trees to preserve flowers and fruits and strive for a greater high yield.

    加强花后管理　争取柑桔更大丰收
    南方各地果园已施花前肥一到二次，普遍中耕、修剪、防治病虫
    辽宁盖平各人民公社采取各项增产措施，大搞果树丰产园、丰产树
    本报讯　枝叶茂盛，桔花怒放，目前我国南方各地果园呈现一片春色。为了力争今年水果生产继续跃进，各地正以柑桔为重点，加强花后培育管理。现在一般果园已施花前肥一次，有的达到两次，并且普遍进行了中耕、修剪和防治了病虫害。
    1959年南方各地果树生产获得了大丰收。据广东、湖南、浙江等十一个省（区）和一个专区的统计，1959年果树产量，比1958年续有增长。为了争取今年更大的丰收，从去年冬季以来，各地党委根据“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的方针，加强果树生产的领导。一方面根据本地情况，统一规划，合理安排果树生产，一方面建立和健全果树生产机构，层层确定专人负责。四川省江津县委书记黄家新等深入高牙公社高牙管理区搞好重点，创造了早施肥，早修剪，早除虫的经验，随后县委又在这里召开现场会进行推广，由于县委的推动，全县追肥时间比往年提早了一个月；一万八千五百亩柑桔已有80％追肥一次，其中三分之一达到二次，每株追精肥一担左右；据不完全的统计，全县各级干部和社员栽种的柑桔试验田就有三百四十七亩。
    南方各地1958年和1959年两年大跃进的经验证明：保花保果是保证果树丰产的重要环节。目前，柑桔、香蕉等果树产区正抓住时机，以保花保果为中心，大力贯彻农业“八字宪法”，加强果园的管理。许多地区在管理果园中，都做到了肥多，水足，培土厚，防治病虫害彻底。浙江省黄岩县今年桔园施肥二道半，比去年增加一道多，施肥量也比去年增加50％以上。去年获得柑桔大面积丰收的湖南省溆浦县，今年进一步运用桔园间种绿肥，桔园养猪的经验，增积肥料。这个县在四千五百十三亩结果柑桔园中间种了三千七百二十亩绿肥，利用桔园养猪四千头。由于猪多肥多，到2月底，平均每亩施了肥料一百多担，比去年同期增加15％左右。
    为了搞好果树生产，各地在“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的方针指导下，统一安排劳动力，普遍建立和健全专业队，负责经常性的培育管理。四川省果树生产专业队由去年的四百八十三个增加到九百二十个，队员由六千二百八十四人增加到一万八千多人。有些专业队实行“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）“一奖”，进一步发挥了社员的积极性，推动了培育管理工作。福建省九湖公社蔡坑大队根据果树树龄大小、生长强弱，把七百二十七亩柑桔分三种类型包给专业队经营管理。由于采用这一办法，社员的干劲更大了，到现在已施了两次人粪尿，比去年多施一次；去年没有培土，今年每亩培土四百担到六百担。
    各地在抓现有果园培育管理的同时，充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，利用荒山、荒坡、河渠两岸、道路两旁，集中成片地建立新果园。仅四川省的社、队园艺场就由去年的十五个增加到三百十九个，面积由三千亩增加到五万亩。广西僮族自治区玉林县从去年8月到今年1月，全县出动八十五万人次，实现了全县社社队队都有花果山。
    本报讯　苹果之乡辽宁省盖平县，各人民公社在搞农业丰产方、丰产山、丰产川的同时，大搞果树丰产园、丰产树，誓夺今年苹果大丰收。
    盖平县的果树生产，由于采取了增产措施，加强了栽培管理，苹果总产量逐年提高，去年总产量达到六万吨，比大跃进的1958年提高20％。为了今年更大丰收，盖平县的干部群众正在根据他们制定的果树生产“八大改革”（改瘠薄地为沃壤，改进施肥方法，改灌“救命水”为适时浇水，改三年育出幼苗为一、二年育出，改稀植、稀枝、稀果为保花保果，改规律性防治为对症防治，改单一水果为水果干果并重，改小面积丰产园为大面积丰产园）开展春季果园管理工作。
    盖平广大果树技术员和技术手在县委提出的“不剪三月枝”的号召鼓舞下，果树春季修剪比往年提前一个月。到2月末全部完成任务，修剪结果树二百万棵，小树一百九十万棵。
    各果树公社，与剪枝的同时，还穿插着掀起了群众性的除虫灭病害的运动。在今春除治病虫害当中，各社都进一步贯彻了“防重于治，联防联治”的方针，社社、队队都建立了技术组织和观测预报点。到3月10日全县苹果树已普遍用人工刮治一到二次，把历年危害果树的病菌、虫卵、幼虫一扫而光。今年的治虫也比往年早动手一个月。
    为了加强果树生产的经营，今年各级党委书记都挂帅来抓这项生产。县委第一书记魏民，亲自抓果树生产，并深入到熊岳人民公社唐屯生产队果树丰产园里参加生产领导生产。九寨公社由于有两名党委书记挂帅，并在果树园里搞试验田，因而加强了这个社的果树管理。今年这里的每棵果树比去年多施厩肥二百斤，加施化肥二斤，还提前在2月10日就抬冰和引水上山浇了果树。目前，春风吹来果树发润，全县社员正在为保花、保果，争取更大丰产给果树松土、喷药。
