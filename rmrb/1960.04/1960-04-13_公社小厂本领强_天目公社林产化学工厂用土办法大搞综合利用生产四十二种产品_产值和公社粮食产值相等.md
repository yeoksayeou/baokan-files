The Commune's Small Factory Has Great Skills
    Tianmu Commune's Forest Chemical Factory Uses Indigenous Methods to Vigorously Develop Comprehensive Utilization and Produce Forty-Two Kinds of Products
　Output Value is Equal to the Commune's Grain Output Value

    (Our dispatch) The Tianmu People's Commune in Changhua County, Zhejiang Province, has established a forest chemical factory that comprehensively utilizes forest resources. It can produce forty-two kinds of products, and its annual output value is equal to the commune's grain output value. It has created many miracles in the year since its establishment. The Ministry of Forestry recently held an on-site meeting here to promote the factory's experience throughout the country.
    This factory was formed by merging sixty-two charcoal kilns. When the factory was first established, many people felt that the word "chemical" was mysterious and thought that it was “a toad wanting to eat swan meat” for the masses to run a chemical factory, and that it would definitely "lose money." The commune party committee mobilized the masses to debate for seven consecutive days, and the party members, Youth League members, and activists among the masses stood up straight and firmly believed: "The road is made by people. If we don't do well today, we will definitely do well tomorrow."
    After the ideological problem was resolved, there were still many practical difficulties. There was no capital, and the equipment and tools, except for a few charcoal kilns, a few carrying poles, and a few ropes, were almost non-existent. The commune party committee decided to focus on charcoal burning and gradually expand the scope of operations. First, thirty comprehensive utilization kilns were built, and more than 500 dan of vinegar stone were produced within three months, selling for more than 10,000 yuan. This achievement greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Based on this achievement, the party committee decided to try to refine aromatic oil. Without a copper pot for refining oil, a water tank was used instead; without a tin condensing coil, bamboo was used instead. After fifteen trials, more than 300 jin of aromatic oil were finally refined from a section of camphor wood that was originally burned as firewood. It is now able to produce twenty-eight kinds of aromatic oils.
    At a meeting, the factory's leading cadres heard that pine root dry distillation could refine oil, and they began experimenting again. Based on some simple introductions in newspapers and magazines, they drew a sketch and built an earthen stove in a land temple to conduct experiments. An old worker, in order to "learn from experience" in other places, carried three jin of rice and some cooked sweet potatoes, crossed the 1,500-meter-high Tianmu Mountain, and walked 150 li.
    The pine root oil was refined, but a new problem arose: the pine root oil appeared to be unsalable, and the factory could not buy diesel for a diesel engine. The workers imagined that rosin is flammable, so wouldn't it be possible to use pine roots as gasoline by turning them into gas or liquid? After more than a dozen experiments, they successfully refined artificial gasoline with a pure white color. This opened up a new way to further utilize forest resources and solve the problem of fuel for power.
    Now the factory has established twenty workshops, using "foreign" principles and "indigenous" materials and structures to make a new set of equipment, and has realized the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, firepower, and water. All the raw materials that enter this factory (bark, roots, leaves, nutshells, etc.) can be completely processed into finished products for export, without any discarded waste. Even the ash in the furnace is made into potassium carbonate; the heat energy in the flue is not allowed to escape. People do not see smoke coming out of the chimney and exclaim in amazement, calling it a "smokeless factory."
    According to statistics from relevant departments, if areas with suitable conditions across the country establish a number of such small-scale forest chemical factories, they can produce about one million tons of fiberboard (which can replace more than five million cubic meters of logs) and large quantities of rosin, turpentine, baked glue, vinegar stone, and aromatic oils per year, which will greatly contribute to meeting the needs of industry, people's livelihood, and exports.

    公社小厂本领强
    天目公社林产化学工厂用土办法大搞综合利用生产四十二种产品
　产值和公社粮食产值相等
    本报讯　浙江省昌化县天目人民公社办了一座综合利用森林资源的林产化学工厂，能够生产四十二种产品，年产值同公社的粮食产值相等。建厂一年来创造了不少奇迹。林业部不久前在这里召开了现场会议，向全国推广这个厂的经验。
    这个厂是由六十二个木炭窑合并起来的。初建厂的时候，不少人听到“化”（化学）字就觉得神秘，认为群众办化学工厂是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，肯定“办不起来”；办起来也要“蚀老本”。公社党委发动群众一连辩论了七天，党员团员和群众中的积极分子腰杆挺起来了，他们坚信：“路是人走出来的，今天办不好，明天一定能办好”。
    思想问题解决以后，实际困难还是不少。资金没有，设备和工具除了有几座炭窑、几根扁担、几条绳索以外，几乎一无所有。公社党委决定，以烧炭为主，逐步扩大经营范围。首先搞了三十座综合利用窑，三个月内生产了五百多担醋石，卖了一万多元。这一成就大大鼓舞了群众的热情。
    在这个成就的基础上，党委决定，试炼芳香油。没有炼油的铜锅，用水缸代替；没有锡作的盘肠管，用毛竹代替。试炼十五次，终于利用一段当柴烧的樟木树炼出了三百多斤芳香油。现在已经能生产二十八种芳香油。
    厂里的领导干部在一次会议上听说，松根干馏可以炼油，又开始了试验。他们根据报纸、杂志的一些简单介绍，画了一张草图，在土地庙内搭了一座土灶进行试验。一个老工人为了到外地“取经”，背了三斤米和一些煮熟的番薯，翻过海拔一千五百米的天目山，步行了一百五十里。
    松根油炼出来了，又遇到新问题：松根油出现滞销现象，厂里有一部柴油机又买不到柴油。职工们设想，松香是易燃的，把松根变成气体或液体，不是一样可以当汽油使用吗？经过十几次的试验，果然炼出了色泽洁白的人造汽油。为进一步利用林产资源、解决动力用油问题，开辟了新的途径。
    现在这个厂已经建立了二十个车间，用“洋”的原理，“土”的材料和构造，自制了一套新设备，并且实现了原料、火力和水的三大综合利用。凡是进到这个厂的原料（树皮、树根、树叶、果壳等），都可以全部加工成成品出厂，没有一点抛弃的废料。就是炉内的柴灰都制成了碳酸钾；烟道中的热能也不让它跑掉。人们不见烟囱冒烟，惊叹地称为“无烟工厂”。
    据有关部门统计，如果全国有条件的地区，都建立一批这样的小型林产化学厂，一年约能生产上百万吨的纤维板（可以代替五百万立方米以上的原木）和大量的松香、松节油、烤胶、醋石和芳香油等产品，对供应工业和人民生活以及出口的需要有很大作用。
