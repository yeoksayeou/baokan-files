Comrades Chairman and Representatives:
After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the National Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft National Budget for 1960" at the congress, I have gained a comprehensive and profound understanding of the continuous Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country's work in 1959 under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line, and the grand plan for continuing the leap forward in 1960, which is certain to be achieved. I wholeheartedly endorse these two reports and firmly believe that they will further strengthen the confidence of the people across the country to continue the leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and further inspire the people across the country to "aim high and have great ambitions," and fight with soaring enthusiasm for the infinitely beautiful prospects of building socialism and communism.

I am a worker in the coke oven chemical industry. Now I would like to report to the congress some of the situations I know about the coke oven chemical industry, under the leadership of the Party and the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture across the country, breaking down superstitions, emancipating the mind, and making high-speed leaps forward.

The coke oven chemical industry is a relatively highly developed industry in the comprehensive utilization of coal. Its main product, "coke," is an essential basic fuel to ensure the high-speed leap forward in iron and steel production, non-ferrous metal smelting, machinery casting, and the chemical industry. The dozens of chemical products produced by the coke oven chemical industry are also important sources of industrial raw materials and urban gas needed for national defense industries, the manufacture of artificial fibers, plastics, dyes, pesticides, medicines, fertilizers, as well as railways, transportation, and construction.

Precisely because its technology has reached a relatively high and fixed level of development, there has been less and slower progress for decades. Many people have a deep superstition about foreign coke ovens, one-sidedly emphasizing the advantages of high thermal efficiency and labor productivity of foreign coke ovens, as well as simple and reliable production operations, and failing to see the disadvantages of large investment, numerous equipment and materials, and slow construction of foreign coke ovens. In 1958, the Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute and other units, under the call of the Party, broke down superstitions and emancipated their minds, and designed several simple coke ovens. After pilot tests proved successful, the simple No. 2 coke oven began to be promoted. Some people failed to see the advantages of simple coke ovens, such as fast construction, low investment, simple equipment and materials, good coke quality, coal saving, and comprehensive utilization to recover chemical products; one-sidedly emphasizing certain shortcomings of the simple No. 2 coke oven. They said, "The simple No. 2 coke oven is not good." Facts are the most powerful witnesses. The production capacity of the newly built simple No. 2 coke ovens in 1959 alone was close to the total capacity of all foreign coke ovens built over the years up to 1959. This is an unprecedented and extraordinary Great Leap Forward in the history of coke oven industry development. The Jiangsu Metallurgical Bureau compared the coke produced by local coke and simple No. 2 coke ovens throughout the province: When the blast furnace used coke from the simple No. 2 coke oven, the coke ratio decreased from 1.2 to 0.7 compared to using local coke; the utilization coefficient increased from 0.93 to 2.31. The Shanxi Provincial Metallurgical Department compared the coal consumption of earthen kilns and simple No. 2 coke ovens: the simple No. 2 coke oven saved 300 kilograms of raw coal per ton of coke compared to local coke. In recent months, new achievements and advanced indicators have continuously emerged in the production positions of the simple No. 2 coke oven. Recently, several high-yield red flags have appeared in the Qinhuangdao Coking Plant and other coking plants. These facts not only prove that simple coke ovens have fast construction, low investment, simple equipment and materials, good coke quality, coal saving, and can comprehensively utilize and recover chemical products, but also further point out the direction for the development of coke ovens. The facts of the past year show that simple coke ovens are the inevitable product of the Great Leap Forward. It is an important step for the small-scale enterprises' indigenous production to gradually adopt modern technology and transform to foreign methods of production. Like small blast furnaces, it embodies the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs.

In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, we coke oven chemical workers have broken down superstitions and emancipated our minds, which is also specifically manifested in the following aspects:

1.  The coking plant of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company broke the old rules of oven start-up for new coke ovens, shortening the oven start-up time to about 30 days.

2.  The Wusong Gas Plant of Shanghai Gas Company broke the old operation tradition of coke oven charging. More than a year of production operation has proven that not only can the output be increased by about 25%, but also the coal blocks are easier to load, and the coal leveling time is saved. Due to the enlightenment of this fact in technical thinking, many coking workers have been ideologically liberated and are concentrating their efforts to tackle technical problems in order to strive for doubling the metallurgical coke output and making greater use of gas coal on existing foreign coke ovens.

3.  On the basis of learning from advanced Soviet technology, coke oven chemical workers, after arduous struggle, have initially clarified the way to produce high-quality metallurgical coke by using 100% of China's vast and abundant resources of weakly caking coal in terms of technology.

In short, the Great Leap Forward in the coke oven chemical industry has caused a comprehensive and profound revolution in the coke oven chemical technology and basic theory. I believe that through the development of new coke oven chemical technology and basic theory, the coke oven chemical industry will be advanced to a higher level.

All this is the victory of the Party's General Line! The victory of the Great Leap Forward! The victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

### 土洋结合发展炼焦化学工业  李恩业代表的发言

    土洋结合发展炼焦化学工业
    李恩业代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    在大会上听了李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”以后，使我对国家的1959年各项工作，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，持续大跃进的事实和1960年一定要继续跃进并且一定能继续跃进的宏伟计划，得到一个十分全面、十分深刻的认识。我衷心拥护这两个报告，并且深信它将进一步坚定全国人民更加多快好省地继续跃进的信心，进一步鼓舞全国人民“树雄心、立大志”，以冲天的干劲，为建设社会主义和共产主义的无限美好前景而斗争的力量。
    我是一个炼焦化学工作者。现在我把我所知道的有关炼焦化学工业，在党的领导和全国工农业大跃进的形势下，破除迷信，解放思想，高速跃进的一些情况，向大会汇报。
    炼焦化学工业是煤的综合利用中一项较高度发展的工业。它的主要产品“焦炭”是保证钢铁生产、有色金属冶炼、机械铸造和化学工业高速跃进必不可少的基本燃料。炼焦化学工业所生产的几十种化学产品，又是供应国防工业，制造人造纤维、塑料、染料、农药、医药、化肥，以及铁道、交通、建筑等方面需要的工业原料和城市煤气的重要来源。
    正由于它的工艺技术达到较高度和较定型的发展水平，因此几十年来进步较少、较慢。许多人对大洋焦炉的迷信很深，片面地强调大洋焦炉热工效率和劳动生产效率高，而且生产操作简便可靠的优点，看不清大洋焦炉投资大、设备材料多、建设慢的缺点。1958年鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院和其他单位，在党的号召下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，设计出几种简易焦炉。通过试点证明后，开始推广简易二号焦炉。有些人看不到简易焦炉建设快、投资少、设备材料简单、焦炭质量好、耗煤省、能综合利用回收化学产品等优点；片面强调简易二号焦炉的某些缺点。他们说：“简易二号焦炉不好。”事实是最有力的证人，1959年一年新建的简易二号焦炉的生产能力，就接近到1959年止历年所建大洋焦炉的全部能力。这是焦化工业发展史上空前的特大跃进。江苏冶金局把全省土焦与简易二号焦炉焦炭做了对比：高炉使用简易二号焦炉焦炭炼铁比用土焦时，焦比由一点二降低到零点七；利用系数由零点九三提高到二点三一。山西省冶金厅做了土窑与简易二号焦炉耗煤的对比：简易二号焦炉炼焦比土焦每吨要节约原煤三百公斤。几个月来，在简易二号焦炉生产岗位上不断出现新的成绩和先进指标。最近还出现了秦皇岛市焦化厂和其他焦化厂几面高产红旗。这些事实不仅证明简易焦炉建设快、投资少、设备材料简单、焦炭质量好、耗煤省、能综合利用回收化学产品，而且更进一步为焦炉的发展方向指出了道路。一年来的事实说明：简易焦炉是大跃进的必然产物。它是小型企业的土法生产逐步采取现代化技术、向洋法生产转化的一个重要步骤。它与小高炉一样体现了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针。
    两年来，我们炼焦化学工作者在党的领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，还具体表现在如下的几个方面：
    1、武汉钢铁公司焦化厂打破了新焦炉烘炉的旧规律，把烘炉时间缩短到三十天左右。
    2、上海煤气公司吴淞煤气厂打破了焦炉装炉的旧操作传统。一年多的生产操作证明：不但可以增产约25％，而且下煤块（好装），还节省平煤时间。由于这一事实在技术思想上的启发，许多炼焦工作者都得到思想解放，正在集中力量，猛攻技术关，为争取在现有大洋焦炉上冶金焦产量翻番和多利用气煤而奋斗。
    3、在学习苏联先进技术的基础上，炼焦化学工作者经过艰苦奋斗，已经初步在工艺技术上明确了百分之百采用我国广大丰富资源的弱粘结煤炼制优质冶金焦炭的途径。
    总之，炼焦化学工业的大跃进，已经引起了炼焦化学工艺技术和基础理论的全面的和深刻的革命。我相信，通过新的炼焦化学工艺技术和基础理论的发展，又将把炼焦化学工业推进到一个更高的水平。
    这一切都是党的总路线的胜利！大跃进的胜利！战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！
