This newspaper's report from Xi'an on the 19th: Cotton sowing in Shaanxi has entered its peak season. People's communes in various regions have adopted many methods to save land and expand cotton fields. The province plans to plant 4,510,000 mu of cotton this year, an increase of 54,000 mu compared to last year's actual harvested area, and this has been fully implemented. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a call to cotton-producing areas, demanding a further increase of 50,000 mu of insurance cotton fields. While expanding cotton fields, various regions are paying close attention to improving sowing quality. In sowing, comprehensive innovation of cotton planting techniques and the application of advanced cotton planting experience are being used to achieve uniform and strong seedlings. The area of high-yield fields (Qiuxiang fields) this year has expanded from 258,000 mu last year to more than 2,170,000 mu, accounting for 48.4% of the total cotton field area.

Comprehensively carrying out technological innovation in cotton planting is a decisive measure for Shaanxi Province to seize a greater cotton harvest. This year's technological innovation in cotton planting has expanded from small-scale high-yield fields to all cotton fields; from past single-technology reforms to comprehensive cotton planting technological innovation including soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, labor, etc., from sowing to harvest. All cotton fields in Shaanxi Province have undergone deep plowing, leveling high and low areas, and large-scale leveling, initially achieving the standards of garden-like cotton fields in more than 1,460,000 mu. The base fertilizer for cotton fields is generally 5,000 to 10,000 jin per mu, and high-yield cotton fields apply 15,000 to 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu; moreover, a series of innovations are implemented in fertilization methods, such as matching according to soil quality, crop rotation, fertilizer type, and layered fertilization. Cotton fields with irrigation facilities in the province have expanded by more than 68% compared to last year's actual irrigated area. Sufficient good seeds, 25 to 30 jin per mu, have been prepared, most of which have been carefully selected, and good seed combinations have been carried out according to the natural conditions and characteristics of various varieties. More than 13,000 new strip sowing machines have been produced this year, adding to the existing 27,000, averaging one strip sowing machine for every 130 mu, which can ensure that sowing in the province's cotton-growing areas does not violate the farming season. In order to adapt to ventilation and light transmission after close planting, most areas have changed from equidistant rows to wide and narrow rows, and from east-west rows to north-south rows. Most cotton fields have also undergone soil disinfection and seed dressing with pesticides to prevent pests and diseases.

In the innovation of cotton planting technology, special attention has been paid to promoting the scientific cotton planting technology of Zhang Qiuxiang, a famous cotton planting expert, which is to “look at the sky, look at the land, and look at the crops.” In February, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized the first secretaries of the county committees in various cotton-producing areas to visit Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton fields and listen to her report. Therefore, on the basis of last year's experience in planting "Qiuxiang fields," various regions have further flexibly applied new cotton planting technologies. This year, due to drought and high temperatures, various regions have generally started sowing earlier. However, due to the different regional climate, soil, and water conservancy conditions, the sowing time, sowing depth, and other aspects vary from place to place. For example, the temperature in the eastern part of Guanzhong area is generally three or four degrees higher than in the western part, so cotton sowing is also five to ten days earlier than in the western part. Weinan, Dali, Sanyuan, and other counties in the eastern region have organized technicians to universally measure ground temperature since April 2, and started cotton sowing on April 5, about five days earlier than last year. In terms of sowing depth, various regions have also made different treatments according to different conditions, with shallower depths for clay soils and deeper depths for sandy soils. Different improved varieties and different specifications of reasonable close planting are promoted according to the conditions of different regions.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. As of the 14th, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had sown nearly 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and the sowing progress and quality have greatly exceeded any previous year.

The preparation work for cotton planting in various parts of Xinjiang this year started early, progressed quickly, and was carried out solidly and meticulously. Most of the cotton fields have been winter-irrigated and deeply plowed; for some cotton fields with poor soil moisture and those that have not been deeply plowed, irrigation, deep plowing, and leveling and harrowing have been carried out in advance since the beginning of spring, and some counties have initially realized the garden-like management of cotton fields. Generally, about 8,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu in cotton fields in various regions, half of which is high-quality fertilizer; in key cotton planting counties such as Turpan, Shanshan, Moyu, and Makit, an average of 10,000 to 20,000 jin or more of base fertilizer is applied per mu. All cotton-growing areas have achieved improved varieties, and most areas have also replaced new varieties with higher yields and better quality. In order to speed up the sowing progress and ensure the sowing quality, various regions have transformed ten-row sowing machines in advance to sow cotton, and have also manufactured a large number of cotton sowing machines and row markers, so that all cotton fields can achieve strip sowing.

At present, people's communes south of the Tianshan Mountains and in the Turpan Basin are concentrating their labor force to sow, striving to plant all well and achieve a bumper harvest per mu. Although the temperature in the Hotan area has been extremely abnormal since March 20, the sowing progress is still far ahead of last year. As of April 12, 80% of the cotton fields in the entire area have been sown, the sowing area will be larger than last year, and the sowing period will also be shorter than last year. Kashgar area, the main cotton-producing area of Xinjiang, plans to plant food and oil crops on newly reclaimed wasteland as much as possible, which not only ensures the expansion of the area of food, oil, and other crops, but also expands the cotton fields. The people's communes in Turpan have established cotton planting teams (groups) to divide responsibilities and check each link. After inspection, the sown cotton fields have reached good soil moisture, loose soil, appropriate depth and row spacing, and uniform seeds.

Party committees at all levels in cotton-growing areas are paying close attention to the sowing quality of high-yield demonstration plots and command fields, thereby driving the large fields. In the Hotan area, from the secretary of the prefectural committee to general cadres, 90% of their efforts are devoted to going deep into the fields and disseminating advanced experience in a timely manner. Before sowing, Hotan and other counties first held on-site demonstration meetings on sowing technology in high-yield demonstration plots to promote new cotton planting technologies, which quickly improved the sowing level of the entire county.

    陕西力争比去年扩大十万亩棉田
    从种到收全面革新植棉技术提高单位产量
    新疆棉花播种进度快质量好
    本报西安19日电　陕西棉花播种已进入高潮。各地人民公社采用了许多办法节约用地，扩大棉田，全省今年计划植棉四百五十一万亩，比去年的实收面积扩大五万四千亩，并已经全部落实。中共陕西省委最近又向产棉区发出号召，要求再增种五万亩保险棉田。各地在扩大棉田的同时，十分注意提高播种质量。在播种中，全面革新植棉技术，运用先进的植棉经验，要做到苗齐苗壮，今年丰产田（秋香田）的面积已由去年二十五万八千亩扩大到了二百一十七万多亩，占到棉田总面积的48.4％。
    全面进行植棉技术革新，这是陕西省夺取棉花更大丰收的一项决定性的措施。今年植棉技术革新，已由过去的小面积的丰产田，扩大到全部棉田；由过去的单行技术改革发展到从播种到收获，包括土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工等全面植棉技术革新。陕西省的全部棉田都进行了深耕、铲高填低、大平大整，初步作到园田化标准的棉田有一百四十六万多亩。棉田基肥一般每亩五千斤至一万斤，丰产棉田每亩施基肥一万五千斤至二万斤；而且在施肥方法上实行按土质、按茬口、按肥种搭配和分层施肥等一系列的革新。全省有灌溉设施的棉田已比去年实灌面积扩大了68％以上。每亩备足了良种二十五斤至三十斤，大部经过了精选，并按照各地的自然条件和各种品种的特性进行了良种组合。今年新生产条播机一万三千多件，加上原有二万七千多件，平均每一百三十亩即有一架条播机，这样可以保证全省棉区播种不违农时。为适应密植后的通风透光，大部分地区已把等距行改为宽窄行，把东西行改为南北行。大部分棉田还进行了土壤消毒和药剂拌种，以防止病虫为害。
  在革新植棉技术中，特别重视了推广著名植棉能手张秋香“看天、看地、看庄稼”的科学植棉技术。中共陕西省委在2月间组织各产棉区县委第一书记参观张秋香的棉田，听取了她的报告。因此，各地在去年种“秋香田”的经验基础上，进一步灵活运用了新的植棉技术。今年因为干旱、气温高，各地普遍提早播种。但是，由于地区气候、土壤、水利条件的不同，各地又在播种时间、播种深浅等等方面又各不相同。例如关中东部地区气温一般比西部地区高三、四度，因此，棉花播种比西部地区也早五至十天。东部地区的渭南、大荔、三原等县从4月2日起，已组织技术人员普遍测量地温，4月5日就开始了棉花播种工作，比去年提前了五天左右。在播种的深度上，各地也根据不同的情况作了不同的处理，粘性土壤较浅，沙性土壤较深。并根据不同地区的条件，推广不同的良种和不同规格的合理密植。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区到14日止，已播棉田近六十万亩，播种进度和质量都大大超过已往任何一年。
    新疆各地今年的植棉准备工作动手早，速度快，作得扎实细致。绝大部分棉田都曾经冬灌、深翻；对部分墒情不好和没有经过深耕的棉田，入春以来都提前灌溉、深耕和平整耙磨，部分县初步实现了棉田园田化。各地棉田一般每亩施肥八千斤左右，其中一半是优质肥；在吐鲁番、鄯善、墨玉、麦盖提等重点植棉县，平均每亩施基肥一万到二万多斤。各棉区都实现了良种化，绝大部分地区还更换了产量更高、质量更好的新品种。为了加快播种进度和保证播种质量，各地提前改装了十行播种机来播棉花，又制作大批播棉机、划行器，让全部棉田实现条播。
    目前，天山以南和吐鲁番盆地的各人民公社正集中劳力播种，力争全部种好，亩亩丰收。和田专区虽然从3月20日以来气温一直极不正常，但是播种进度还是大大超过去年。截至4月12日止，全专区已有80％的棉田下种，播种面积将比去年扩大，播种期也将比去年缩短。新疆主要棉区——喀什专区，有计划地将粮食和油料尽量种在新开的荒地上，既保证扩大了粮食、油料等作物的面积，又扩大了棉田。吐鲁番各人民公社成立植棉队（组）分工负责，环环检查。已播棉田经过检查，达到墒好，土松，深浅行距适当，种子均匀。
    棉区各级党委都大抓丰产方、指挥田的播种质量，从而带动大田。和田专区上至地委书记下至一般干部，以90％的力量深入田间，及时传播先进经验。和田等县在播种前先在丰产方内召开播种技术示范现场会，推广新的植棉技术，迅速提高了全县的播种水平。（附图片）
