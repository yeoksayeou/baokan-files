Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian delivered a report on April 9th at the National Light Industry Technical Revolution Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Light Industry and the Light Industry Trade Union, and the Agricultural Product Processing Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Textile Industry. He focused on issues such as agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian first analyzed the current situation of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources. He pointed out that at present, the processing of agricultural products one-stop and the comprehensive utilization of various resources are being widely carried out, and the climax of a vigorous mass movement is about to arrive. Comrades in the light industry departments, textile industry departments, and finance and trade departments should mobilize to welcome this climax. We must resolutely follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the one hand, on the basis of the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and on the basis of the all-round development of grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous products, widely carry out agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources; on the other hand, through the mass movement of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources, promote the rapid development of agriculture and even the entire national economy.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the current new situation of the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy and the communization of the people urgently requires the rapid and extensive development of the agricultural product processing industry and the comprehensive utilization of various resources. Industry, especially light industry and the textile industry, needs more raw materials. The increasing needs of urban and rural people and foreign trade for industrial products and agricultural products require the extensive exploitation of material resources through large-scale agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources. The rapid development of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising requires the agricultural product processing industry and the comprehensive utilization of various resources to catch up by leaps and bounds, in order to provide various concentrated feeds and rough feeds in large quantities and rapidly. All of this requires a great technical revolution and cultural revolution, gradually realizing the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources, greatly improving labor productivity, saving living labor and materialized labor, and obtaining the most and best material wealth with the least labor.

Although the current situation of agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources has greatly improved compared with the past, it still lags far behind the needs of the development of the situation. It is mainly manifested in four aspects. First, the technology is backward and labor productivity is low. At present, the general situation of processing equipment is that manual and animal power are used more, and mechanical power is used less; indigenous methods of production are used more, and foreign methods of production are used less. In the entire processing industry, mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment accounts for only about 20%, and the other 80% are indigenous equipment and indigenous production methods. Second, the various processing links have not been unified to form a processing system (one-stop) in the raw material production area. For example, in the case of cotton, processing plants that closely integrate the processing links of ginning, stripping cotton seed short绒 [short fibers around the seed], and extracting cotton seed oil account for only about 8% of all cotton processing plants. As for processing plants that closely integrate these preliminary cotton processing links with the various processing links for the comprehensive utilization of various cotton by-products, there are even fewer. The processing situation of many other varieties is roughly the same. In addition, after the active adjustments made by the industrial departments over the past ten years, the layout of processing plants is generally reasonable; however, some processing plants that should be located in the raw material production areas have not been set up in the raw material production areas, or the equipment is too concentrated, the processing capacity is too large, the transportation burden is too heavy, the raw material supply problem cannot be well resolved, and the equipment cannot be fully utilized. Third, the resources that have already been comprehensively utilized account for only a part of all resources available for comprehensive utilization, and a large number of resources have not been fully valued and utilized by people. Fourth, in the past year or two, many regions have launched mass movements for agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources, and have achieved certain results. However, on the whole, it has not yet created a vigorous momentum for the mass movement, and has not yet developed into a comprehensive mass movement. All this shows that at present, the processing of agricultural products and the comprehensive utilization of various resources is a weak link in the development of the national economy.

Changing this backward situation is not only urgently needed now, but also has fully favorable conditions. We already have more than 13.35 million tons of steel, and 18.4 million tons of steel will be produced in 1960, providing material conditions. The consolidation and development of the people's communes and the further发挥 [giving full play to] the advantages of being large in size and having a high degree of public ownership provide social conditions. On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, culture and science have also developed, providing technical conditions. The further development of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the rapid increase in people's political awareness, and the unprecedented upsurge in enthusiasm for building socialism provide ideological conditions. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction have taken deep root among the broad masses, and the series of struggles launched by 650 million people to realize the general line are a powerful driving force for the development of all work and a fundamental guarantee for achieving great victories on all fronts of socialist construction in our country.

Recently, Party committees at all levels have generally attached importance to the work of agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources, and are treating this work as a major and urgent task to be completed. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people of the whole country have begun to take active action and have achieved initial results. Agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources will soon develop into a vigorous mass movement. Our current task is to continue to strengthen leadership, conscientiously summarize, improve, exchange, and promote advanced experience, and rapidly push the mass movement of agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources to a climax.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian then said that processing is production, and the comprehensive utilization of various resources is realized through processing. Vigorously developing agricultural product processing and comprehensive utilization of various resources is an important aspect of expanding raw material sources, developing production, increasing social wealth, and accelerating socialist construction.

The so-called processing one-stop is to closely integrate the various links of agricultural product processing and gradually build a relatively complete and rational processing system in the raw material production area. Minimize processing links and strive to achieve multiple uses for one set of equipment, greatly improving the labor productivity of agricultural product processing. Taking cotton as an example, it is necessary to strive to establish a one-stop processing system in the production area that integrates the processing links of ginning, stripping cotton seed short 绒 [short fibers around the seed], extracting cotton seed oil, stripping cotton stalk skin, and comprehensively utilizing various cotton by-products. The processing one-stop should strive for mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The so-called comprehensive utilization is to effectively and rationally utilize the seeds, skins, shells, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and juices of domestic and wild plants, and the meat, skin, fur, bones, horns, blood, organs, glands, and miscellaneous products of domestic and wild animals through one-stop processing. Turn useless into useful, turn small use into large use, turn one use into multiple uses, increase the economic value of agricultural products, and increase social wealth.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian also said that under the conditions that are conducive to building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and under the principle of focusing on the business of their own departments, the light industry, textile industry, and commercial departments can produce raw materials and manufacture equipment according to needs and possibilities. All industrial raw materials and production equipment that the state allocates insufficiently but they can solve themselves must be self-reliant and solve themselves. These departments can all run some chemical industry, and some iron, steel, aluminum, zinc, and lead industry.

Vigorously developing agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources is extremely beneficial politically and economically. To sum up, there are mainly ten major benefits. First, increase industrial raw materials, market commodities, and export sources. Second, increase the income of the state, communes, and commune members. Third, increase livestock feed, which is conducive to the development of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising. Fourth, increase fertilizers and pesticides. Fifth, save manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Sixth, facilitate the statistics of agricultural output and the grasp of the commodity rate of agricultural products. Seventh, promote the development of diversified management by the people's communes. Eighth, promote the industrialization of the communes and the mechanization of agriculture. Ninth, cultivate technical personnel and popularize scientific knowledge. Tenth, strengthen urban-rural relations and develop the worker-peasant alliance.

From the above ten major benefits, it can be seen that developing agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources is conducive to the development of commune industry and local industry, conducive to the development of agricultural technology transformation, and conducive to the early realization of the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program. It is by no means a general business technology problem, but a major problem that requires further liberation and development of social productive forces in one aspect, and is a problem of people controlling and conquering nature to a greater extent. To solve this problem, people must have a deep understanding and a high degree of awareness of processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources, and must launch a series of intensive activities, work actively, and struggle hard. We must actively improve the relations of production and the superstructure in this regard, mobilize all positive factors, and realize the urgent requirement for the high-speed development of productive forces.

In his report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian explained in detail the guidelines and measures for agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources.

He said that the guiding principles for agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources should be: under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhere to putting politics in command, implement the mass line, break superstitions, emancipate the mind, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act; comprehensively carry out technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation; take overall consideration, make overall arrangements, grasp the key points, develop in many ways, adapt to local conditions, combine indigenous and foreign methods, be diverse, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and rapidly push the mass movement of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources to a climax.

In order to realize this policy, the following ten measures must be taken:

First, vigorously launch mass movements, and closely integrate centralized leadership with mass movements.

Experience has proven that as long as we vigorously launch mass movements under the unified leadership of the Party and mobilize the masses to do their own affairs, we can rapidly develop technical innovation and technical revolution, appropriately solve problems such as funds, equipment, and materials in processing and comprehensive utilization, and fully understand the main contradictions in the development of things, so as to effectively solve them.

From the leadership's point of view, on the one hand, we must adopt a firm attitude and fully support every revolutionary action of the people; on the other hand, we must promptly concentrate the inventions and creations of the masses and promote them to every corner of the country, turning them into the wealth of the whole people. In this way, the combination of leadership and the masses can continuously push forward the mass movement of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources, creating huge material wealth and spiritual strength.

Second, vigorously popularize and actively improve, and combine popularization and improvement.

Agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources must be fully developed and blossom everywhere. Only with vigorous popularization can there be a foundation and possibility for improvement; and only by continuously improving on the basis of popularization can the mass movement of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources be continuously raised to a new level. Our policy is to popularize and improve simultaneously, popularize while improving, improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement.

Third, grasp the key points and promote the general, and give equal importance to plants, animals, and minerals.

From the perspective of finance and trade departments, textile departments, and light industry departments, the processing and comprehensive utilization of the entire resource should be plant first, animal second, mineral third, adapt to local conditions, be diverse, and give equal importance to all three. Among plants, we should focus on the "five domestic and five wild" starches, fibers, oils, chemical raw materials, and medicines; among the main resources, we should focus on grain, cotton, and oil; among miscellaneous resources, we should focus on fiber, starch, and oil. This year, we must process a large amount of cotton stalk skin fiber and other miscellaneous fibers. The comprehensive utilization of various resources should vigorously develop industrial raw materials, livestock feed, various foods, and chemical raw materials. We must start from the most urgent aspects of socialist construction and from the aspects most conducive to the high-speed development of socialist construction in accordance with the requirements of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Fourth, give equal importance to indigenous production methods and foreign production methods, and actively realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation.

The agricultural product processing one-stop that we want to develop should be a one-stop that is mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated. However, now we must proceed from reality. If we can use foreign methods, we will use foreign methods. If we cannot use foreign methods, we will use semi-foreign methods. If we cannot use semi-foreign methods, we will use indigenous methods. Indigenous and foreign methods should be used simultaneously to advance rapidly. That is to say, now it can be a mechanized or semi-mechanized, automated or semi-automated one-stop, it can be an indigenous one-stop, or it can be a combination of indigenous and foreign methods one-stop. As long as it becomes a one-stop, it can achieve results and gain experience. In short, we must combine far-sightedness with being down-to-earth.

While vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in agricultural product processing, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in the people's economic life. There are many avenues and great potential in this regard. Cooking, making shoes, sewing clothes, washing clothes, milling rice, grinding flour, extracting oil, ginning cotton, warehousing and storage, loading and unloading and transportation, retail sales, accounting and ticketing, and many other aspects all need semi-mechanization and mechanization. All need rationalization and scientification. All need to greatly improve management technology and operating technology. It is also an important part of the entire social technical innovation and technical revolution. We should make significant achievements in 1960 as much as possible.

Fifth, the processing system should be rationally laid out, and processing plants should be run by both state-owned and commune-run (including basic accounting unit management).

The processing system must resolutely implement the policy of building factories in the raw material production areas. There should be a combination of large, medium, and small, with medium and small as the main focus. Existing processing plants that do not conform to this principle should be appropriately changed. The most important issue here is: to study how large the processing system should be and in what range of the raw material production area it should be established in order to be the most economical and rational. According to the initial experience of some places, the establishment of the processing system can mainly be within the scope of a commune; for certain varieties, factories can be set up in the scope of a county or above. Processing plants can be state-owned (including county-run), can be jointly operated by the state and communes, can be managed by state-owned communes, can be commune-run (including basic accounting unit management), or can be jointly operated by several communes. Which specific form is good should be based on the principle of being conducive to the high-speed development of the national economy.

Sixth, the materials and equipment needed by the processing plant should be solved by indigenous methods, striving for self-reliance and local solutions.

Vigorously developing agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources requires a large amount of chemical raw materials (mainly acids and alkalis), and requires machinery, equipment and materials. In addition to the part supplied by the state according to plan (the materials that have been allocated must be implemented), finance and trade, light industry, and textile industry departments should also vigorously develop small indigenous groups and small foreign groups, and do everything possible to solve it by themselves. Combine self-reliance with the state's planned supply. Many things must be based on self-reliance, and vigorously promote cooperation.

Seventh, vigorously cultivate and train technical personnel, and launch a "technology to the countryside" movement.

Light industry departments, textile industry departments, and commercial departments should be determined to organize technical personnel in batches and phases to go deep into the countryside to vigorously help people's communes cultivate and train technical personnel. Every technical personnel should be educated to actively participate in the fiery mass movement. A movement should be launched among technical personnel to do good things for the people's communes, advocating that every technical personnel and every state-owned factory do a good thing for the peasants and communes, completely regarding the affairs of the peasants and communes as their own affairs, and regarding them as a piece of flesh on their own body. In the movement, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, business departments, scientific research institutions, and people's communes should be closely combined, and leading cadres, technical personnel, and the broad masses should be closely combined.

Eighth, cultivate and protect resources, and combine cultivation and utilization.

Attention must be paid to protecting and cultivating wild animals and wild plants, and transforming wild plants into domestic plants under possible conditions. Rely on the mountains for sustenance, nurture the mountains; rely on the water for sustenance, nurture the water. We must not exhaust the source and fish out the pond. For perennial resources, we must seize the opportunity to cultivate them as early as possible. There should be plans, measures, inspections, and dedicated personnel responsible. We must never only care about the present and ignore the future, only engage in short-term effectiveness and not long-term effectiveness.

Ninth, summarize experience, do a good job in planning, strengthen collaboration, and arrange labor.

We must conscientiously summarize advanced experience and continue to cultivate typical examples. We must systematically summarize and improve local experience, and actively learn and absorb experience from other places. Several on-site meetings should be held to quickly promote all experiences that can be comprehensively promoted. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, according to needs and possibilities, we must do a good job in the one-year plan, three-year plan, and longer-term plan for agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources. Once the plan is made, we must organize forces to implement it and carry it out throughout. Under a unified plan, we must not only "each immortal cross the sea," each showing their own unique abilities, and everyone making achievements in their respective positions, but also vigorously promote the communist style of collaboration, carry out large-scale cooperation between industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation, promote each other, and develop together, forming a vast front for the work of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources. We must establish specialized production teams, so that all production has specialized teams, and combine the regular production of the specialized teams with the blitz production of temporarily mobilized forces.

Tenth, strengthen Party leadership and adhere to putting politics in command.

Comprehensively carrying out agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources is a new and arduous task. Many problems have not yet been solved, and we will definitely encounter many difficulties. Many people will not clearly understand its importance all at once. Therefore, in order to rapidly push the mass movement of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources to a climax and to ensure the healthy development of the movement, the key lies in strengthening Party leadership. Of all the thousands of things, Party leadership is the first. Everything depends on Party leadership. The provincial, prefectural, county, and commune Party committees are required to firmly grasp the work of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources in the near future and complete it as a political task. We must conscientiously do a good job in political and ideological work and propaganda and education among the broad masses of cadres and people. The most important thing is to effectively solve the problem of the attitude of cadres, especially business cadres and technical cadres, towards the mass movement, and overcome the conservative ideas of some people. We must educate the broad masses of cadres and people to have lofty ambitions, establish lofty aspirations, emancipate their minds, break superstitions, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and resolutely oppose the cowardly and lazy worldview that nothing can be done. We must take the lead in ideology, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and create a upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward, and closely combine the ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution on the front of agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources.

Finally, Vice Premier Li Xiannian suggested that Party committees at all levels prepare fully, start early, and launch two large-scale upsurges of mass movements for agricultural product processing one-stop and comprehensive utilization of various resources after the summer harvest and after the autumn harvest this year.

    李先念副总理在全国轻工业技术革命会议和农产品加工会议上作报告
    大搞农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用
    新华社15日讯　国务院副总理李先念4月9日在轻工业部、轻工业工会联合召开的全国轻工业技术革命会议和商业部、轻工业部、纺织工业部联合召开的农产品加工会议上作报告，着重谈了农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用等问题。
    李先念副总理首先分析了当前农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用工作的形势。他指出，目前，农产品的加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用，正在广泛地开展起来，一个声势浩大的群众运动的高潮将要到来。轻工业部门、纺织工业部门和财政贸易部门的同志们，应当动员起来，迎接这个高潮。要坚决按照党中央和毛主席的指示，一方面，在农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的基础上，在粮、棉、油、麻，丝、茶、糖、菜，烟、果、药、杂全面发展的基础上，广泛开展农产品加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用；另一方面，要通过农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动，促进农业以至整个国民经济的迅速发展。
    李先念副总理说，目前，国民经济连续大跃进和人民公社化的新形势，迫切要求农产品加工事业和各种资源综合利用工作迅速地、广泛地开展起来。工业特别是轻工业、纺织工业需要更多的原料，城乡人民和对外贸易对于工业品和农产品的需要日益增加，要求从大搞农产品加工和各种资源综合利用中来广泛开辟物质资源；以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产的迅速发展，要求农产品加工事业和各种资源的综合利用工作大踏步赶上来，以便大量地、迅速地提供各种精饲料和粗饲料。而所有这些，都要求大闹技术革命和文化革命，逐步实现农产品加工和各种资源综合利用的机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，大大提高劳动生产率，节约活劳动和物化劳动、用最少的劳动拿到最多的最好的物质财富。
    现在农产品加工和各种资源综合利用的状况，虽然比过去已有了很大的发展，但是，还远远落后于形势发展的需要。它主要表现在四个方面。第一、技术落后，劳动生产率低。目前加工设备总的情况是，人力、畜力推动的多，机械动力带动的少；土法生产的多，洋法生产的少。在全部加工业中，机械化、半机械化的设备大约只占20％左右，其它80％左右都是土设备和土法生产。第二、各个加工环节没有统一在原料产地建成加工体系（一条龙）。例如棉花，把轧花、剥棉籽短绒、榨棉籽油等加工环节紧密结合在一起的加工厂，只占全部棉花加工厂的8％左右；至于把这些棉花初步加工的环节，和对棉花的各种副产品实行综合利用的各个加工环节，紧密结合在一起的加工厂那就更少了。其它许多品种的加工状况，也大体如此。此外，经过工业部门十年来的积极调整，加工厂的布局大体上是合理的；但是有些应当设立在原料产地的加工厂，没有在原料产地设置，或者设备过于集中，加工能力过大，运输负担过重，原料供应问题不能很好解决，设备不能充分利用。第三、已经实行综合利用的资源，还仅仅占全部可供综合利用资源的一部分，大量的资源还没有被人们充分重视和利用起来。第四、最近一两年来，许多地区开展了农产品加工和各种资源综合利用的群众运动，取得了一定成绩。但是整个地讲来，还没有造成轰轰烈烈的群众运动的声势，还没有发展为全面的群众运动。所有这些都说明，目前农产品的加工和各种资源的综合利用，是国民经济发展中的一个薄弱环节。
    改变这种落后状况，现在不但迫切需要，而且具备了充分有利的条件。我们已经有了一千三百三十五万多吨钢，1960年将要生产一千八百四十万吨钢，提供了物质条件；人民公社的巩固和发展，一大二公优越性的进一步发挥，提供了社会条件；在工农业生产发展的基础上，文化科学都有了发展，提供了技术条件；政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命进一步开展，人们的政治觉悟迅速提高，建设社会主义的情绪空前高涨，提供了思想条件。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，党的社会主义建设总路线，已经在广大群众中深深地扎下了根，六亿五千万人民为实现总路线而开展的一系列的斗争，是一切工作向前发展的强大动力，是我国社会主义建设各个战线取得伟大胜利的根本保证。
    最近，各级党委对于农产品加工和各种资源综合利用的工作，已经普遍引起重视，正在把这项工作当作一件重大的迫切的任务来完成。在各级党委领导下，全国人民已经开始积极行动起来，取得了初步成绩。农产品加工和各种资源综合利用，即将发展成为一个声势浩大的群众运动。我们现在的任务就是，要继续加强领导，认真总结、提高、交流和推广先进经验，把农产品加工和各种资源综合利用的群众运动迅速推向高潮。
    李先念副总理接着说，加工就是生产，各种资源的综合利用，是通过加工来实现的。大搞农产品加工和各种资源综合利用，是扩大原料来源，发展生产，增加社会财富，加速社会主义建设的一个重要方面。
    所谓加工一条龙，就是要把农产品加工的各个环节，相互密切结合起来，在原料产地逐步建成比较完整的和合理的加工体系。尽量减少加工环节，力求做到一套设备多种用途，大大提高农产品加工的劳动生产率。以棉花做例子，就是要把轧花、剥棉籽短绒、榨棉籽油、剥棉秆皮等加工环节，以及对棉花的各种副产品进行综合利用的各个加工环节，力求在产地建立一条龙的加工系统。加工一条龙，应该力求做到机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化。所谓综合利用，就是通过一条龙的加工，对家生、野生植物的籽、皮、壳，叶、茎、根，花、果、汁，对家生、野生动物的肉、皮、毛，骨、角、血，脏、腺、杂，进行有效的合理的综合的利用。变无用为有用，变小用为大用，变一用为多用，提高农产品的经济价值，增加社会财富。
    李先念副总理还说，在有利于多快好省地建设社会主义的条件下，在以本部门业务为主的原则下，轻工业、纺织工业和商业等部门，可以根据需要与可能，自己生产原料，制造设备；凡是国家分配不足，而自己又可以解决的工业原料材料和生产设备，一定要自力更生，自行解决。这些部门都可以办些化工，办些钢铁铝锌铅工业。
    大搞农产品加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用，在政治上和经济上是极为有利的，归纳起来，主要有十大好处。第一，增加工业原料，市场商品和出口货源。第二，增加国家、公社和社员的收入。第三，增加牲畜饲料，有利于以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产的发展。第四，增加肥料和农药。第五，节约人力、物力和财力。第六，便于统计农业产量和掌握农产品商品率。第七，促进人民公社开展多种经营。第八，促进公社工业化和农业机械化。第九，培养技术人才，普及科学知识。第十，密切城乡关系，发展工农联盟。
    从上述十大好处可以看出，发展农产品加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用，有利于公社工业、地方工业的发展，有利于农业技术改造的发展，有利于发展农业四十条纲要的提前实现。它决不是一般的业务技术问题，而是社会生产力在一个方面要求进一步解放和发展的重大问题，是人们在更大程度上控制自然和征服自然的问题。而要解决这个问题，人们对于加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用，就必须具有深刻的认识和高度的自觉，就必须展开一系列的紧张活动，积极工作，艰苦奋斗。要在这方面积极改善生产关系和上层建筑，调动一切积极因素，实现生产力高速度发展的迫切要求。
    李先念副总理在报告中，详细地说明了农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的方针和措施。
    他说，农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的方针应当是：在各级党委的统一领导下，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻执行群众路线，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，全面开展以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，统筹兼顾，全面安排，抓住重点，多方开展，因地制宜，土洋并举，多种多样，多快好省，把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动迅速推向高潮。
    为了实现这个方针，必须采取以下十项措施：
    第一，大搞群众运动，把集中领导和群众运动密切结合起来。
    经验证明，只要在党的统一领导下，大搞群众运动，群众的事情发动群众自己去办，就能够迅速发展技术革新和技术革命，就能够适当解决加工和综合利用中的资金、设备和材料等问题，就能够充分认识事物发展中的主要矛盾，从而去有效地加以解决。
    从领导上说，一方面必须采取坚决的态度，全力支持人民群众的每一个革命行动；另一方面要把群众的发明创造及时地集中起来，把它推广到全国的每一个角落，变成全民的财富。这样，领导和群众相结合，就能够把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动不断推向前进，创造出巨大的物质财富和精神力量。
    第二，大力普及，积极提高，普及和提高并举。
    农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用，必须全面发展，遍地开花。只有大力普及、提高才有了基础和可能；也只有在普及的基础上不断地提高，才能够把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动不断提高到新的水平。我们的方针是，又普及又提高，边普及边提高，在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下普及。
    第三，抓住重点，推动一般，植物、动物、矿物并举。
    从财贸部门、纺织部门和轻工业部门来说，整个资源的加工和综合利用，应当是植物第一，动物第二，矿物第三，因地制宜，多种多样，同时并举。在植物中，应当以家生野生的淀粉、纤维、油脂、化工原料和药物“五家五野”为重点；在正项资源中，应当以粮、棉、油为重点；在杂项资源中，应当以纤维、淀粉、油脂为重点，今年要大量剥制棉秆皮纤维和其它杂纤维。各种资源的综合利用，应当大搞工业原料、牲畜饲料、各种食品和化工原料。要根据多快好省的要求，从社会主义建设最迫切的方面入手，从最有利于社会主义建设事业高速度发展方面入手。
    第四，土法生产和洋法生产同时并举，积极实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化。
    我们要搞的农产品加工一条龙，应当是机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化的一条龙。但是，现在要从实际出发，能洋就洋，不能洋就半洋，不能半洋就用土法，土洋并举，迅速前进。也就是说，现在可以是机械化或者半机械化、自动化或者半自动化的一条龙，可以是土法的一条龙，也可以是土洋结合的一条龙。只要搞成一条龙，就能收到效果，取得经验。总之，要把高瞻远瞩和脚踏实地结合起来。
    在大搞农产品加工技术革新和技术革命的同时，要大力开展人民经济生活方面的技术革新和技术革命。这方面的门路很广，潜力很大。做饭、做鞋、缝衣、洗衣，碾米、磨面、榨油、轧花、仓储保管、装卸运输、门市售货、算账点票，以及其它许多方面，都需要半机械化、机械化。都需要合理化、科学化，都需要大大提高经营技术和操作技术。它也是整个社会技术革新和技术革命的一个重要组成部分。我们应当在1960年，尽一切可能作出显著的成绩。
  第五，加工体系要合理布局，加工厂实行国营、社营（包括基本核算单位经营）并举。
    加工体系，要坚决实行在原料产地建厂的方针，应该大中小并举，中小为主。现有的加工厂，不符合这个原则的，要适当改变过来。这里最重要的问题是：要研究加工体系应当具有多大的规模，应当在多大范围的原料产地建立，才算是最经济最合理。根据某些地方的初步经验，加工体系的建立，可以以一个公社的范围为主；某些品种，可以在县或县以上的范围设厂。加工厂可以是国营（包括县营），可以是国、社合营，可以是国营社管，可以是社营（包括基本核算单位经营），或者几社联营。究竟采取那种具体形式为好，应当以有利于国民经济的高速度发展为原则。
    第六，加工厂所需要的材料和设备，应当采取穷办法，力求自力更生，就地解决。
    大搞农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用，需要大量的化工原料（主要是酸碱），需要机器设备和材料。除了国家有计划供应的部分以外（已经分配的材料要落实），财贸、轻工业和纺织工业部门，还应当大搞小土群、小洋群，千方百计，自己动手解决。把自力更生和国家有计划供应结合起来。许多东西必须以自力更生为主，并且大搞协作。
    第七，大力培养和训练技术人员，开展“技术下乡”运动。
    轻工业部门、纺织工业部门和商业部门，应当下决心组织技术人员分批分期深入农村，大力帮助人民公社培养和训练技术人员。要教育每一个技术人员，积极投入到火热的群众运动中去。要在技术人员中开展一个为人民公社办好事的运动，提倡每一个技术人员、每一个国营工厂为农民和公社办一件好事，把农民和公社的事情完全看作是自己的事情，当作自己身上的一块肉。在运动中要在党委统一领导下，把业务部门、科学研究机关和人民公社密切结合起来，把领导干部、技术人员和广大群众密切结合起来。
    第八，培植和保护资源，把培植和利用结合起来。
    必须注意保护和培养野生动物、野生植物，并且在可能条件下变野生为家生。靠山吃山，吃山养山，靠水吃水，吃水养水。不能枯本穷源，竭泽而渔。对于多年生的资源，必须及早抓紧培植。要有规划，有措施，有检查，有专人负责。决不能只顾眼前，不管将来，只搞短期见效的，不搞长期见效的。
    第九，总结经验，搞好规划，加强协作，安排劳力。
    要认真总结先进经验，继续培养典型。既要系统总结和提高当地的经验，又要积极学习和吸收外地的经验。要开好几个现场会议，把一切可以全面推广的经验，都迅速推广开来。要在党委统一领导下，根据需要与可能，搞好农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的一年规划、三年规划和更长期的规划。规划一作出来，就要组织力量，付诸实施，贯彻始终。在统一规划下，既要“八仙过海”，各显神通，大家都在各自的岗位上作出成绩来；又要大兴共产主义协作之风，开展工、农、商、交大协作，相互促进，共同发展，把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的工作，形成一条广大的战线。要建立专业生产队，做到一切生产都有专业队，把专业队的经常生产，与临时调集力量的突击生产结合起来。
    第十，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    全面开展农产品加工一条龙和各种资源的综合利用，是一项新的艰巨的工作，不少问题还没有过关，一定会遇到许多困难，不少人也会对它的重要性一下认识不清楚。因此，要把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动迅速推向高潮，要保证运动的健康发展，关键在于加强党的领导。千条万条，党的领导第一条。一切决定于党的领导。要求省委、地委、县委、公社党委，在最近一个时期务必狠狠抓紧农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的工作，把它当作一个政治任务来完成。要在广大干部和群众中，认真作好政治思想工作和宣传教育工作。最重要的是要切实解决干部特别是业务干部、技术干部对待群众运动的态度问题，克服某些人的因循守旧思想。要教育广大干部和群众树雄心，立壮志，解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格；坚决反对那种这也办不到，那也不可能的懦夫和懒汉的世界观。要思想领先，反右倾，鼓干劲，形成学先进、比先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进的热潮，把农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用战线上的思想革命、技术革命和文化革命密切结合起来。
    李先念副总理最　后建议各　级党委充分准备，及早动手，在今年夏收以后和秋收以后，掀起两次大规模的农产品加工一条龙和各种资源综合利用的群众运动高潮。
