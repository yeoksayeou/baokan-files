The Paint Isn't Dry

　　Wang Guangrong, staff member of the Datong City Construction Industry, Shanxi

　　In the summer of 1954, the small steamer on the Minjiang River sounded its whistle. Facing the crowds seeing us off from the province at the dock, we felt extremely excited. This batch of us was transferred from local areas to the industrial front. Among this group were guerrilla fighters from the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian, military representatives who had taken over Kuomintang agencies… Along the way, passing through Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing, carriages were added one after another, looking almost a mile long. This was a large batch of cadre strength being sent from East China to the industrial base during our country's First Five-Year Plan. The train crossed the Shanhaiguan Pass, and carriages were reduced one by one. Some stayed in Anshan, some in Fushun, and some went to Dalian. Only our original group was left, and we all arrived in Jilin City in the chemical industrial zone. We joined the construction army building our motherland.

　　When we were still living in the bathhouses left by the Japanese, barely sheltering us from the wind and rain, we began to throw ourselves into the battles on the construction site. Although we were still novices in industry, under the leadership of the Party, we quickly united the worker masses and engineering technical personnel.

　　After more than two years of intense construction, our country's first modern chemical industrial base – the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone – was born. From there, nitrogen fertilizer, dyes, and other chemical products were transported out. Just as our construction representatives were giving speeches at the handover ceremony in the Chemical Industrial Zone Department Store, we received the task of building a new area, and thus we dared to make bold statements at the conference: we are willing to build every piece of land in our motherland, just like building the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone. Let desolate wildernesses be transformed into forests of chimneys and rows of buildings; at the newly rising crossroads, set up street gardens, and around them, let workers' cultural palaces, department stores… soar into the clouds.

　　In 1957, with this kind of feeling, we transferred again from the Northeast to inland areas, arriving in Taiyuan City, the capital of Shanxi Province.

　　At the foot of the Lüliang Mountains, we initially encountered wild jujube forests, wild rabbits, and ancient tombs. In more than two years of practical work, we learned preliminary construction knowledge, but we never thought we would also have to learn some archaeological knowledge. The underground treasures of ancient culture were unearthed by us. Now, we can quickly distinguish whether the murals, pottery, and sculptures in the tombs are from the Five Dynasties or the Tang and Song Dynasties.

　　After numerous mass movements, vigorous technical innovations, high-speed construction, and rapid completion… under the strong leadership of the Party and with the support of all parties, the Taiyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant was recently put into production.

　　However, the task of the builders has not yet been completed. Hundreds of residential buildings have not been handed over, the water park has not been built, and the club building has not yet begun construction. Yes, there are many tasks, and we don't want to relax, but even greater tasks are waiting for us. We have received a new task of building another area.

　　How happy I am! I have joined a vanguard force for building a factory again. In the spring of 1960, a group of us left the Yanmen Pass and came to Datong City, beginning our new combat life. When I stood on the boundless fields, watching cart after cart of farm fertilizer being spread on the leveled land, I thought in my heart: Fellow villagers, where you are farming will soon be a factory area, this side will be a residential area, and the middle will be a protective green area. This is our construction base, and our tents will be pitched here.

　　I seem to hear the whistle of the small steamer on the Minjiang River again. Looking back at the short few years since my transfer to the industrial front, our country's industrial construction has taken such rapid steps! We have personally participated in the construction of this kind of modern large industry, and its extraordinary high speed has deeply attracted us, making us feel so encouraged and so close. In this great era, being able to participate in this kind of combat life makes us feel proud and happy! I am willing to travel all over our country like this! I am willing to write our message in front of every newly completed building: "Comrades moving into new homes, please note: the paint isn't dry, be careful of stains!"

    油漆未干
    山西大同市建筑业职工　汪光瑢
    1954年夏天，闽江里的小火轮响起了汽笛声，我们面对着码头上省里送行的人群，心情感到十分激动。我们这一批人就这样由地方转业来工业前线了。这一批人中有福建老苏区的游击战士，有接收国民党机关的军事代表……。一路上，经过杭州、上海、南京又加上去一节节的车厢，看上去足有一里路长了。这是华东区向工业输送的一大批干部力量，奔向了我国第一个五年计划期间的工业基地。火车跨过山海关，一节一节车厢又减少了，有人留在鞍山，有人留在抚顺，有人去大连了。只剩下原来我们这一批人，都来到了化学工业区的吉林市。我们参加了建设祖国的建筑业大军。
    当我们还住在日本人留下的仅避风雨的洗澡塘里的时候，我们就开始投入工地的战斗了。虽然我们还是工业的外行，但是在党的领导下，我们很快地团结了工人群众和工程技术人员。
    经过两年多的紧张的施工，我国第一个近代化的化学工业基地——吉林化工区诞生了。从那里运出来了氮肥、染料和其它化工产品。就在我们建筑者的代表在化工区百货大楼交工典礼大会上致词的时候，我们接到了建设新区的任务，因而我们敢于在大会上作出豪言壮语：我们愿意建设祖国的每一块土地，就像建设吉林化工区一样。要让荒凉的原野变成烟囱林立，楼房幢幢；在新起的十字街口上布置起街心花园，在它的四周让工人文化宫、百货大楼……高耸入云。
    1957年，我们就怀着这种心情，又从东北转移到关内，来到了山西的省会太原市。
    在吕梁山下我们开始碰到的是酸枣林、野兔、古墓。在两年多的实际工作中，我们学到了初步的施工知识，但是，我们没有想到还得要学些考古知识呢。地下的古文化宝藏被我们挖出土来了。现在，我们很快便能分辨出墓中的壁画、陶器、塑像是五代的，或是唐宋时代的。
    经过多少次的群众运动，大搞技术革新、高速施工，快速结尾，……在党的大力领导下，在各方的支援下，太原氮肥厂又于最近投入生产了。
    但是，建设者的任务还没有完成，上百幢楼房的住宅区没有交工，水上公园没有修起，俱乐部大厦还没有开工呢。是的，任务很多，我们也不想松气，但更大的任务又在等待着我们了。我们又接到了建设另一个地区的新任务。
    我是多么幸福呵！我又参加了一个建厂的先遣部队。1960年的春天，我们一批人出了雁门关，来到大同市，开始我们新的战斗生活。当我站在一望无边的田地上，望着一车一车的农家肥料撒在平整的土地上的时候，我的心里在想：老乡们，你们耕作的那儿不久将是工厂区、这边是住宅区、中间是防护绿化区。这是我们的建筑基地，我们的帐篷就要扎在这里了。
    我仿佛又听到闽江里的小火轮的汽笛声，我回顾转业到工业战线上的短短的几年中，我们祖国的工业建设迈着多么快速的步伐呀！我们亲自参加了这种近代的大工业的建设，它的那种异乎寻常的高速度，深深地吸引了我们，使我们感到那么鼓舞，那么亲切。在这个伟大的时代里，能够参加这种战斗的生活，我们感到自豪，幸福！我愿意就这样走遍我们的国家！我愿意在每一幢刚交工的楼房前写下我们的留言：“搬进新居来的同志们请注意：油漆未干，小心污沾！”
