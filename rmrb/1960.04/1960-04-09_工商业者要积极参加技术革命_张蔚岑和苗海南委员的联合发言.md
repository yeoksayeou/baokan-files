Industrialists and Businessmen Should Actively Participate in the Technological Revolution
Joint Speech by Committee Members Zhang Weicen and Miao Hainan

We industrialists and businessmen must overcome all kinds of erroneous attitudes and negative sentiments, and be determined to lean to one side wholeheartedly. In the excellent situation of the rapid development of socialist construction in the motherland, we must further strengthen our self-remolding and actively contribute our technical talents.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

We completely support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Account and the 1960 National Budget. We agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC over the past year.

The 1960 National Economic Plan is a plan for a comprehensive and sustained leap forward, pointing out new goals for our socialist construction in 1960. In production, we industrialists and businessmen should firmly take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, vigorously promote technological innovation and the technological revolution, and strive to contribute to the 1960 National Economic Plan.

Now I would like to talk about the issue of industrialists and businessmen engaged in commercial work participating in the technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization:

Like all parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, especially after the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the great call to "hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously promote a new upsurge in the production, learning, and technological revolution movements, and strive to better and more comprehensively overfulfill the 1960 National Economic Plan," the people of the province, especially the workers and peasants, warmly responded to the Party's call and quickly set off a high tide of production, learning, and technological revolution movements. For example, the comrades of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, inspired by the call to "march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization," launched the "Huaihai Campaign" and "Yangtze River Crossing Campaign" towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, putting forward the heroic slogan of "Fight the Huaihai, cross the Yangtze, sweep away manual operation!" After a few days of battle, they achieved a degree of 94% in transforming manual operations into mechanization and semi-mechanization. Under the impetus and influence of this situation, we industrialists and businessmen, generally speaking, also participated in the three major movements of production, learning, and technological revolution. Some, under the education of the Party and the leadership and help of the worker comrades, have also made certain achievements. However, there are still some problems. Many people emphasize that they do not understand technology, have no culture, and have no time, and so they do not actively participate in the technological revolution movement. Especially industrialists and businessmen working in the commercial field believe that technological innovation is a matter for the industrial sector and for technical personnel, and has nothing to do with themselves. For example, some say, "There is nothing to innovate in commercial work," and others say, "What innovation can a salesperson do?" We believe that not only can industry carry out technological innovation, but commerce can also carry out technological innovation. A large number of facts prove that engineers and technicians can carry out technological innovation, and so can salesmen and service personnel. The broad masses of working people have already set an example for us to learn from, and some of the more advanced industrialists and businessmen have also made achievements under the education of the Party and the help of workers. The key issue is whether we industrialists and businessmen listen to the Party wholeheartedly, are determined to "care about one thing," "lean to one side," and wholeheartedly serve socialism. The thousands upon thousands of vivid facts created by the broad masses of working people in the learning, production, and technological revolution movements are a profound education for us. In our view, they are not all engineers, nor do they all have a high level of education. The issue is that they only care about one thing, disregard everything, and work selflessly for the country and the people, creating many amazing miracles. Among them, there are also many who are engaged in commercial work. Can't industrialists and businessmen engaged in commercial work engage in technological innovation? From the situation of the private personnel of the Daguanyuan Shopping Mall in Jinan City engaging in technological innovation together with the workers under the leadership of the Party, it can be seen that industrialists and businessmen engaged in commercial work can also engage in technological innovation.

The Daguanyuan Shopping Mall is a large-scale comprehensive shopping mall in Jinan City. Since February of this year, after the Party Committee of the shopping mall issued a call to all employees to "take the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and actively participate in the three major movements of learning, production, and technological revolution," many private personnel, under the education of the Party and the leadership of the workers, participated in the three major movements. At that time, there were indeed many people who believed that "the Spring Festival supply is already tense enough, there is no time for innovation," and some people believed that "there is nothing new to innovate in commercial work." Regarding studying Mao Zedong's works, some believed that "Mao Zedong's works are very profound and cannot be delved into," and even some believed that "it is useless for salespeople to study Mao Zedong's works." Due to the patient education of the shopping mall's Party Committee and the help of the worker comrades, many industrialists and businessmen initially understood the general principles of the universality of contradictions and the resolution of contradictions to promote the development of things. In accordance with the spirit of learning for application, they were gradually able to combine their thinking with reality, and integrate learning with specific business. As a result, seventy people, in close combination with the workers and with the strong support and help of the worker comrades, made seventy-nine technological innovations in four days. For example, the photography store found in their study the contradictions of not being able to take large photos without a turning machine; having few people and many things, low efficiency of manual operation, and supply falling short of demand; and working in a darkroom without seeing the sun, which affects physical health. The cotton cloth store found the contradiction of wasting time on daily measurement and inventory. Through studying Mao Zedong's works, due to the continuous education of the Party and the gradual improvement of ideological understanding, many private personnel have made achievements with the help of the workers. For example, Comrade Zhang Zhijun of the photography store successfully trial-produced an automatic turning machine, solving the contradiction of not being able to take large photos without a turning machine. Comrade Yang Ruibin of the cotton cloth store successfully trial-produced an automatic cloth measuring and marking machine and an electric volume measuring instrument, solving the contradiction of wasting time on inventory. The photography store is also trying to produce automatic cameras and automatic printing machines to solve the contradictions of having few people and many things, supply falling short of demand, and darkroom work affecting health. Some stores have successfully trial-produced coin dispensers to solve the contradiction of slow change, customers waiting, and wasting time. The above facts show that as long as we industrialists and businessmen listen to the Party wholeheartedly and serve socialism wholeheartedly, no matter what work or position we are engaged in, we can play our active role. Therefore, we industrialists and businessmen must overcome all kinds of erroneous attitudes and negative sentiments, be determined to care about one thing, lean to one side, further strengthen our self-remolding in the excellent situation of the rapid development of socialist construction in the motherland, closely integrate with the workers under the leadership of the Party, actively contribute our technical talents, and make more contributions to completing and overfulfilling the 1960 National Economic Plan.

    工商业者要积极参加技术革命
    张蔚岑和苗海南委员的联合发言
    我们工商业者必须克服各种错误态度和消极情绪，决心顾一头，一边倒，在祖国社会主义建设一日千里的大好形势下，进一步加强自我改造，积极贡献技术才能。主席、各位委员：
    听了李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划报告和李先念副总理的1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，我们完全拥护，我们同意陈叔通副主席所作一年来政协工作报告。
    1960年的国民经济计划是一个全面持续跃进的计划，它给我们指出了1960年社会主义建设的新的奋斗目标。我们工商业者在生产上应坚决以毛主席思想为纲大搞技术革新、技术革命为1960年国民经济计划努力奋斗作出贡献。
    现在我想谈一谈，从事商业工作的工商业者，投入以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革命运动问题：
    我省和全国各地一样，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，特别是中共山东省委发出了“高举毛泽东思想红旗，不断的促进生产、学习、技术革命运动的新高涨，为更好更全面的超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗”的伟大号召以后，全省人民，首先是工农劳动人民，热烈的响应了党的号召，迅速掀起了生产、学习、技术革命运动的高潮，如济南市印染厂的职工同志们，在“向机械化半机械化进军”的号召鼓舞下，掀起了向机械化半机械化进军的“淮海战役”、“渡江战役”，提出了“战淮海，渡长江，手工操作一扫光”的英雄口号，经过几天的战斗，就把手工操作变机械化半机械化的程度达到了94％。在这种形势的推动和影响下，我们工商业者，一般的说也参加了生产、学习、技术革命的三大运动，有的在党的教育以及职工同志的带动和帮助下，也作出了一定的成绩，但是还存在一些问题，不少的人强调不懂技术，没有文化，没有时间等等理由，不积极参加技术革命运动。尤其在商业方面工作的工商业者，认为技术革新是工业部门的事，是技术人员的事，与己无关，如有的说“商业工作没有什么革新可搞”，也有的说“营业员还搞什么革新呢？”我们认为不仅工业可以搞技术革新，商业也可以搞技术革新，大量的事实证明，工程师、技术人员可以搞技术革新，营业员服务员也可以搞技术革新，广大劳动人民已经为我们树立了学习榜样，有些比较先进的工商业者也在党的教育和职工帮助下做出了成绩，问题的关键在于我们工商业者是不是一心一意听党的话，下决心，“顾一头”，“一边倒”，一心一意为社会主义服务。广大劳动人民在学习、生产、技术革命运动中，创造的千千万万的生动事实，对我们是一个深刻的教育，在我们看来，他们不都是工程师，也不是都有很高的文化水平，问题就是他们只顾一头，不顾一切为国家、为人民忘我劳动，创造了许许多多惊人的奇迹。其中也有不少是在作商业工作的。从事商业工作的工商业者是不是不能搞技术革新呢？从济南市大观园商场私方人员在党的领导下与职工一道大搞技术革新的情况，可以说明，从事商业工作的工商业者，也是可以搞技术革新的。
    大观园商场是济南市规模较大的综合商场，从今年2月，商场党委向全体职工发出了“以学习毛主席思想为纲，积极投入学习、生产、技术革命三大运动”的号召以后，有不少的私方人员，在党的教育下，在职工带动下，投入了三大运动，当时也确有不少人认为“春节供应已经够紧张的了，没有时间搞革新”也有些人认为“商业工作没有什么新可革”。对学习毛主席著作，有的认为“毛主席著作很深奥，钻不动”甚至有的认为“营业员学毛主席著作没有用”，由于商场党委的耐心教育，以及职工同志的帮助，不少的工商业者初步懂得了矛盾的普遍性和解决矛盾推动事物发展的一般道理，按照学以致用的精神，逐步能够联系思想，联系实际，使学习与具体业务结合，因而有七十人在四天内与职工密切结合并在职工同志的大力支持和帮助下，作出了技术革新七十九项，如照像门市部，在学习中找出了没有转机不能照大像；人少事多，手工操作效率低供不应求；暗室工作不见阳光，影响身体健康的矛盾。棉布门市部找出了每日计量盘点浪费时间的矛盾等等。通过学习毛主席著作，由于党的不断教育，思想认识逐步提高，有不少私方人员在职工帮助下，做出了成绩，如照像门市部张执钧同志试制成功了自动转机，解决了没有转机不能照大像的矛盾，棉布门市部杨瑞彬同志试制成功了自动量布打码机，电动体量计料器，解决了盘点浪费时间的矛盾，照像门市部并正在试制自动照像机和自动印像机，以解决人少事多，供不应求和暗室工作影响健康的矛盾，还有些门市部试制成功了硬币找零器，以解决找零钱慢，顾客等，浪费时间的矛盾等等。上述事实说明，我们工商业者，只要一心一意听党的话，一心一意为社会主义服务，不论从事任何工作和任何岗位，都是可以发挥自己的积极作用的。因此，我们工商业者必须克服各种错误态度和消极情绪，下决心顾一头，一边倒，在祖国社会主义建设一日千里的大好形势下，进一步加强自我改造，在党的领导下，与职工密切结合，积极贡献技术才能，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划作出更多的贡献。
