Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published an editorial titled "The Bandung Spirit Is Triumphing," commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The editorial stated that the Bandung resolutions, the Bandung principles, and the Bandung spirit have become the wealth of the people of all countries. Their positive impact on the international situation is growing year by year, continuously strengthening peace and improving relations between countries and between peoples. The Bandung flag has become the flag of peace and friendship for the people of all countries. The past five years have been the most historically significant stage in the lives of the people of Asia and Africa. Many Asian and African countries, following the glorious Bandung spirit, have unswervingly pursued a neutral, active, and independent foreign policy, resolutely opposing military blocs – tools of colonialism. Loyalty to the Bandung principles is entirely in line with the legitimate national interests of these countries, helping them consolidate the independence they have achieved through arduous struggle, and helping them make their own contribution to the cause of peace and the easing of international tensions. Conversely, any country that participates in military blocs under the protection of Western countries will become a puppet of imperialist forces, lose its independence and sovereignty, and hinder its economic development.

The editorial wrote that the Soviet Union is very sympathetic to the independent countries of the East. The Soviet Union is constantly providing selfless assistance to the people who are consolidating their independence. The people of Asian and African countries warmly support the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" today published an editorial titled "Continue to Strive for the Victory of the Bandung Spirit," saying that in the past five years, the spirit of the Bandung Conference has demonstrated its strong vitality and has had a tremendous impact on the development of the situation in Asia, Africa, and the world.

The editorial stated that the Bandung spirit demonstrates the solidarity and confidence of the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle to eliminate colonialism, and it has become a force for vigorously promoting the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The principle of peaceful coexistence of the Bandung Conference has been followed by many countries and is increasingly becoming a solid foundation for friendly cooperation and peaceful resolution of international disputes between countries with different social systems.

The editorial stated that the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has further promoted the Bandung spirit and the principles of the Bandung Conference. The declaration and resolutions of the conference demonstrated the iron will of the people of Asian and African countries to resolutely fight to eliminate colonialism.

The editorial stated that this conference paid special attention to the Asian and African regions where imperialism is creating tensions, and adopted resolutions on the issues of Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Okinawa, and Algeria respectively. The resolution on the Vietnam issue demanded that the U.S. military delegation must immediately withdraw from South Vietnam and strictly implement the Geneva Accords, greatly encouraging the Vietnamese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 18th: People from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, held a gathering this afternoon at the Trade Union Building to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

This commemoration was jointly organized by eight units including the Mongolian Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Committee for the Defense of Peace. The conference was presided over by Lodoidamba, Chairman of the Mongolian Asian-African Solidarity Committee.

Namsrai, Secretary of the Mongolian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: "The Mongolian people and the Mongolian government believe that the convening of the Bandung Conference is in line with our peaceful aspirations and the foreign policy pursued by Mongolia. Therefore, from the first day of proposing the convening of the Bandung Conference, we have supported it."

Namsrai said that because the struggle of the Asian and African people for national independence has been victorious, many independent national states have emerged on the Asian and African continents. The Mongolian people stand on the side of all oppressed people and sincerely support and sympathize with their struggle for national liberation and independence. In its foreign policy, the Mongolian people resolutely adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence and will more actively struggle to realize the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and maintain friendly relations between countries.

Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Newspapers in Albania, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria have published editorials and articles in the past two days to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

The Albanian "Zëri i Popullit" published a commentary on the 17th titled "Colonialism Is Inevitably Heading Towards Destruction," saying that events in the past five years have shown that the ideas of the Bandung Conference play a huge role in the rapid disintegration of the colonial system. The rapid disintegration of the colonial system is a characteristic of our time.

The commentary pointed out that the imperialists and the Belgrade revisionists fear the growing influence of China, a country with six hundred and fifty million people, on Asian countries. They organized various provocations in an attempt to isolate China in these countries. This is precisely the root cause of some clouds that have appeared in the relations between China and its neighboring countries in recent times. But these temporary clouds will be blown away by the wind of the Bandung spirit. The Bandung spirit teaches the Asian and African people to solve their problems through negotiations. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal will be conducive to this goal.

A commentary in the Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo" on the 17th pointed out that in the past five years, many Asian and African countries have truly felt that the socialist countries stood side by side with them in their most difficult moments and effectively helped them defend their independence. The "Bandung Spirit" has become the foundation of friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries and socialist countries.

The commentary concluded that although the Bandung Conference was five years ago, the "Bandung Spirit" has always been alive. The logic of history dictates that the Bandung spirit will continue to achieve new victories.

A Romanian article in "Scînteia" on the 17th said that the Bandung spirit inspired the people of colonies and dependent countries, making the national liberation movement develop more vigorously. Since the Bandung Conference, the people of Asia and Africa have achieved many victories in the struggle against colonialism. But colonialism, nearing its end, will not abdicate automatically. The ruling methods of the colonialists will become increasingly insidious. One particularly dangerous method adopted by the colonialists is the establishment of military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, which are actually a new form of colonialism. The existence of such groups, which threaten the security and peace of the people of all countries, further proves that there is a close link between the anti-colonialist struggle and the struggle for peace.

Bulgaria's "Trud," "Zemedelsko Zname," and "Kooperativno Selo" all published commentaries on the 17th. "Kooperativno Selo" said: The convening of the Bandung Conference was an event of great significance. According to the evaluation of the initiating countries of this conference, the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Zhou Enlai was a "victory for the cause of peace." The newspaper said that from 1955 to the present, the unity of the Asian and African countries shows that they are a truly great force, and the imperialist elements must not be allowed to harm them at will.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 16th: Warsaw newspapers have published commentaries and articles to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

An article published in "Życie Warszawy" today pointed out that the "Bandung Spirit" is becoming increasingly strong, and the "Bandung Spirit" lives in concrete actions. The newspaper also pointed out that the Western press has exaggerated and rendered some disputes that have occurred between Asian and African countries in recent times. But it must be pointed out that these disputes are secondary compared to unity, and can be resolved through peaceful means.

"Żołnierz Wolności" published a commentary on the 14th titled "The Bandung Spirit," saying that the Bandung Conference brilliantly demonstrated the determination of the people of Asian and African countries to implement independent policies, anti-imperialist policies, policies of solidarity with Asian socialist countries and friendship with the entire socialist camp, policies of peace and cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, April 15th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al Nida" today published an article celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The article called on the people and governments of Asian and African countries to unite more closely under the Bandung spirit to oppose imperialism.

The newspaper said, "The facts of the past five years have convinced people that Asian-African solidarity is necessary, and this necessity is determined by reality and the common destiny of the two continents."

The newspaper emphasized that imperialism is the common enemy of the people of all countries. First and foremost, it is the common enemy of the people of Asian and African countries. The struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism is still very sharp. In order to defeat imperialism, there is no other way but unity.

The newspaper pointed out, "The only danger facing the people of the two continents of Asia and Africa is the danger of imperialism, and not the 'other dangers' as the imperialists and separatists say."

    万隆精神影响巨大　殖民主义必然灭亡
    各国舆论纪念万隆会议五周年
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表题为“万隆精神正在胜利”的社论，纪念万隆会议五周年。社论说，万隆决议、万隆原则、万隆精神已经成为各国人民的财富。它们对国际局势产生的积极影响正在逐年增长，并且不断地加强和平、改善各国之间与各国人民之间的关系。万隆旗帜已经成为各国人民的和平与友谊的旗帜。过去的五年是亚非各国人民生活中最有历史意义的阶段。亚非许多国家遵循着光辉的万隆思想，始终不渝地执行着中立的、积极的、独立的外交政策，坚决反对军事集团——殖民主义的工具。忠实于万隆原则，这十分符合这些国家的合理的民族利益，有助于它们巩固在艰苦斗争中所取得的独立、有助于它们对和平事业与缓和国际紧张局势作出自己的贡献。相反地，任何一个国家如果参加在西方国家庇护下的军事集团，那末，这个国家就会变成帝国主义势力的傀儡，丧失独立与主权，经济发展就会受到阻碍。
    社论写道，苏联十分同情东方独立国家。苏联对正在巩固自己独立的人民不断进行着无私的帮助。亚非国家人民热烈支持苏联爱好和平的政策。
    据新华社河内18日电　越南“人民报”今天以“为万隆精神的胜利而继续奋斗”为题发表社论说，五年来，万隆会议的精神已表现出它的强大的生命力，并对亚洲、非洲和世界局势的发展起了巨大的影响。
    社论说，万隆精神表现了亚非各国人民在消除殖民主义的斗争中的团结和信心，它已成为大力推进亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的力量。万隆会议的和平共处原则，已被许多国家所遵循，而日益成为不同社会制度的国家之间的友好合作关系和和平解决国际争端的稳固基础。
    社论说，第二届亚非人民团结大会已经进一步发扬了万隆精神和万隆会议的原则。大会的宣言和决议说明了亚非各国人民为消除殖民主义而坚决斗争的钢铁般的意志。
    社论说，这次大会特别注意帝国主义正在制造紧张局势的亚非地区，并就越南、朝鲜、老挝、冲绳岛和阿尔及利亚问题分别通过了决议，关于越南问题的决议要求美国军事代表团必须立即撤出南越、严正履行日内瓦协议，更大大地鼓舞了越南人民。
    据新华社乌兰巴托18日电　蒙古首都乌兰巴托各界人民今天下午在工会大厦举行集会，纪念万隆会议五周年。
    这个纪念大会是由蒙古亚非团结委员会、保卫和平委员会等八个单位联合举办的。大会由蒙古亚非团结委员会主席洛多伊达姆巴主持。
    蒙古亚非团结委员会书记那木斯来在会上讲了话。他说：“蒙古人民和蒙古政府认为，万隆会议的召开是符合我们的和平愿望和蒙古奉行的外交政策的。因此，从倡议召开万隆会议的第一天起，我们就支持它。”
    那木斯来说，由于亚非人民争取民族独立的斗争获得胜利，在亚非大陆上出现了许多民族独立国家。蒙古人民站在一切被压迫人民的方面，真诚地支持和同情他们争取民族解放和独立的斗争。蒙古人民在自己的外交政策中坚决奉行和平共处原则，并为实现万隆会议决议和维护各国间的友好关系而更加积极地进行斗争。
    据新华社18日讯　阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚的报纸，近两天来纷纷发表社论和文章，纪念万隆会议五周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”17日以“殖民主义不可避免地走向毁灭”为题发表评论说，近五年来的事件表明，万隆会议的思想在殖民主义制度迅速瓦解的过程中起着巨大的作用。殖民主义制度的迅速瓦解是我们时代的特点。
    评论指出，帝国主义者和贝尔格莱德修正主义者害怕六亿五千万人民的中国对亚洲各国日益增长的影响，他们组织了各种挑衅，企图在这些国家中孤立中国。这正是最近一个时期来在中国和它的邻国之间的关系上出现某些乌云的根源。但是这些暂时的乌云将被万隆精神的风所吹散。万隆精神教导了亚非人民用谈判的方式来解决他们的问题。周恩来总理访问缅甸、印度和尼泊尔将会有利于这一目的。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”17日的评论指出，在过去的五年中，许多亚非国家真实地体会到，在它们最艰难的时刻是社会主义国家同它们并肩站在一起，并有效地帮助它们保卫独立。“万隆精神”已经成为亚非国家和社会主义国家间友好和合作的基础。
    评论最后指出，万隆会议虽然过去了五年，但是“万隆精神”一直是活生生的。历史的逻辑注定，万隆思想还会不断获得新的胜利。
    罗马尼亚“自由罗马尼亚报”17日在一篇文章中说，万隆精神鼓舞了殖民地和附属国的人民，使民族解放运动更加蓬勃地发展起来。自万隆会议以来，亚非人民在反对殖民主义的斗争中已取得了许多胜利。但是临近末日的殖民主义并不会自动退位。殖民主义者的统治方法会变得愈加阴险。殖民主义者采用的特别危险的方法之一就是建立东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织之类的军事集团，这种集团实际上是一种新的殖民主义形式。这种威胁各国人民安全和和平的集团的存在，更加证明了反殖民主义的斗争和争取和平的斗争之间有着紧密的联系。
    保加利亚的“劳动报”、“农业旗帜报”和“合作农村报”17日都发表了评论。“合作农村报”说：万隆会议的召开是一个具有巨大意义的事件。按照这次会议的发起国的评价，以周恩来为首的中华人民共和国代表团的参加是“和平事业的胜利”。这家报纸说，从1955年到现在，亚非各国的团结表明，他们是一个真正的伟大力量，帝国主义分子绝不能为所欲为的危害他们。
    据新华社华沙16日电　华沙各报纷纷发表评论和文章，纪念万隆会议五周年。
    “华沙生活报”今天发表的文章指出，“万隆精神”正在日益强大，“万隆精神”活在具体的行动中。这家报纸还指出，西方报刊对近来亚非国家之间发生的一些争端曾加以夸大和渲染。但是必须指出：这些争端同团结相比是次要的，而且是可以通过和平途径解决的。
      “自由战士报”14日以“万隆精神”为题发表评论说，万隆会议光辉地表现了亚非国家人民执行独立的政策的决心，执行反帝的政策，同亚洲社会主义国家团结和同整个社会主义阵营友好的政策、和平和合作的政策的决心。
    新华社贝鲁特15日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章庆祝万隆会议五周年。文章要求亚非各国人民和政府在万隆精神下更加团结一致来反对帝国主义。
    这家报纸说，“过去五年的事实已经使人深信：亚非团结是必要的，这种必要性是由现实和两大洲的共同命运所决定的”。
    报纸强调说，帝国主义是各国人民的共同敌人。首先是亚非国家人民的共同敌人。亚非国家人民同帝国主义的斗争仍旧很尖锐。为了击败帝国主义，没有其他道路，只有团结。
  这家报纸指出，“亚非两大洲的人民所面临的唯一危险是帝国主义的危险，而不是像帝国主义者和分裂主义者所说的‘其他危险’”。
