Comrades Representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the issue of developing pig raising at high speed.
    In recent years, Henan Province's pig raising industry, like other socialist construction endeavors, has achieved rapid development under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Especially since Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee proposed in the winter of 1959 that farming and animal husbandry should be given equal importance, that pigs are the head of the six domestic animals, and that pig raising should be vigorously developed, a new high tide of a mass movement for the whole Party and all the people to engage in pig raising has rapidly formed throughout the province. Ten-thousand-head, thousand-head, and hundred-head pig farms have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the number of live pigs has increased sharply. As of the end of February 1960, the province's live pig inventory had reached 18 million heads. More than 80% of the pigs are collectively raised by the production brigades of the people's communes. Linru County and another forty-three people's communes have achieved one pig per mu of land; twelve counties and more than one hundred communes have achieved an average of one pig per person. At present, a mass movement to comprehensively develop animal husbandry, with pig raising as the head, is developing rapidly with the momentum of galloping horses and surging waves throughout the province.
    Linru County is a red banner in the pig raising industry in our province. I will now focus on the pig raising situation in this county. At the end of June 1959, Linru County had only more than 90,000 live pigs. After a short period of eight months, by the end of February 1960, the number of live pigs in stock reached more than 1.14 million, an increase of elevenfold.
    To Develop Pig Raising at High Speed, We Must First Pass the Ideological Test
    Why was Linru County able to develop its pig raising industry at such a high speed?
    First of all, it is the result of adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and carrying out continuous revolution. The process of the great development of live pigs in Linru County is a process of struggle between two roads and two ideologies, and a process of continuous revolution and continuous advancement. When the Linru County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward a plan to develop live pigs to 300,000 heads in July last year, a mass ideological struggle immediately unfolded. The focus of the struggle was: Should we give equal importance to farming and animal husbandry? Should we mainly rely on public raising or private raising? Can we develop at high speed? Passing the "ideological test" is the first hurdle in developing pig raising at high speed. On the one hand, the Party and government leaders at all levels in Linru County used many examples of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, promoting each other, achieving bumper harvests, and developing pig raising at high speed, to mobilize the masses, launch free airing of views and debates, raise awareness, and inspire the masses' enthusiasm for raising pigs; on the other hand, they relied on the masses to criticize the cowardice and skepticism of some cadres and the masses, such as "lack of pig sources for raising pigs," "the feed problem cannot be solved," and fear of pig deaths, as well as right-leaning conservative ideas such as not believing that collectives can raise pigs well and not trusting the masses. Through free airing of views and debates, erroneous ideas were criticized, correct ideas were established, and it became a new social custom to glorify pig raising and for everyone to love pig raising. New people and new things such as fathers and sons competing to be feeders and families going to pig farms could be seen everywhere. Because the ideological problem was solved well, the enthusiasm for raising pigs was greatly improved. After more than 100 days of effort from the beginning of July to the end of October last year, the number of live pigs reached more than 210,000, more than doubling the more than 90,000 at the end of June. The victory of the first battle encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. In order to advance in victory, the Party and government leaders of Linru County, with the spirit of continuous revolution, immediately put forward the slogan of marching towards the goal of one pig per person. By the end of December last year, the number of live pigs had developed to more than 400,000, and the second battle was also won. The whole county achieved an average of one pig per person. The two victories made the masses more enthusiastic, continuously revolutionized, and continuously advanced. By the end of February this year, the number of live pigs had developed to more than 1.14 million, reaching one pig per mu of land (the county has more than 1.1 million mu of cultivated land).
    The practice of Linru County reaching one pig per mu of land in eight months proves that launching mass movements and giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes is the decisive key to developing pig raising at high speed. Lacking pig sources, they relied on the masses and the people's communes, adhered to the principle of collective self-breeding and self-raising, carried out the "one pig gives birth to ten piglets and one hundred descendants" movement, and established live pig breeding farms in every commune and brigade. They adopted the method of "keeping all the mothers" and selecting later, and vigorously developed the sow herd. Now, the number of sows in the county has increased sharply from more than 46,000 in mid-July 1959 to more than 263,000, of which more than 133,000 are sows of breeding age. In terms of breeding, advanced technologies such as re-mating, heat-mating, drug-induced estrus, and artificial insemination have been widely promoted, greatly improving the survival rate of breeding. The average litter size of sows in the county is more than 10.5, basically achieving the requirements of full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength, and realizing a "five-full" county. And there have been more than 7,000 sows with high yields of more than 15 piglets per litter, and more than 400 sows with more than 20 piglets per litter. Li Shuiwa, a feeder at the Yuanzhuang Production Brigade Pig Farm, fed 48 sows and adopted the three-mating method, averaging 30 piglets per litter, including one sow with 42 piglets per litter. After a large number of live pigs are bred, ensuring the supply of feed is an important link to ensure the continued development of the pig raising industry. They resolutely implemented the principle of mainly using coarse feed, and adopted the method of collecting, processing, storing, and planting simultaneously, launched a mass movement to collect and store feed on a large scale, and collected a large amount of coarse feed; with the pig farm as the center, they held commune industries and implemented the method of one farm bringing multiple farms (flour mill, distillery, vinegar factory) to process agricultural and sideline products; and they used small pieces of wasteland to plant feed, breaking through the feed barrier. Another important issue to ensure the high-speed development of the pig raising industry is to pass the epidemic prevention barrier. In terms of epidemic prevention, they adopted the method of mainly using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining prevention, management, inspection, and treatment. The county established a total of 337 indigenous pharmaceutical factories, manufactured more than 150 kinds of indigenous pig medicines, and trained more than 3,700 veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel. Communes and brigades established veterinary hospitals, and farms established epidemic prevention rooms, forming a dense epidemic prevention network, basically controlling and eliminating the occurrence of pig epidemics.
    Relying on the Masses, Launching a Large-Scale Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution in Pig Raising
    Relying on the masses, adopting the principle of mainly using indigenous methods and taking both indigenous and foreign methods, and launching a large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movement are important measures to improve work efficiency and develop pig raising at high speed. Linru County has greatly improved feeding tools, adopted the method of using local materials and manufacturing locally, and widely promoted indigenous feed pulverizers, fast mills, built tap water towers on a large scale, indigenous transportation vehicles, wooden tracks and other semi-mechanized feeding tools, so that the average pig raising quota for feeders reached more than 120, improving work efficiency by more than three times. The animal-powered fast mill created by feeder Liu Shufang can process more than 7,000 catties of coarse feed a day, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times. The inventions and creations of the masses are rich and colorful, so that there are fewer people feeding more pigs.
    Strengthening the Party's specific leadership over the pig raising industry, resolutely implementing the policy of "public raising as the main, combining public and private raising" and related policies, is the fundamental guarantee for the sustained leap forward of the pig raising industry. Linru County organized more than 500 county, commune, and brigade Party committee secretaries to go to the pig farms to engage in "experimental fields." It organized more than 1,500 cadres to go deep into the grassroots, raise pigs while working, and lead production with production. At the same time, it also organized large inspections and large evaluations, summarized advanced experiences, held on-site meetings, and launched a "learn, compare, catch up, help" competition movement, promoting the leap forward development of the pig raising industry.
    The great development of the pig raising industry has begun to show an important role in the continuous leap forward of agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives. Since the winter of 1959, the county has accumulated a large amount of pig manure, and the topdressing of wheat fields has been more than in any previous year. In January and February 1960, more than 25,000 fat pigs were sold, which not only supported national construction, but also increased income by more than 100,000 yuan. The Yuanzhuang Brigade achieved one pig per mu of land in 1959. With more pigs, there was more fertilizer. Coupled with other measures, a bumper harvest of grain was achieved, and it jumped from a grain-deficient team to a surplus-grain team. The Guozhuang Brigade averaged 2.4 pigs per mu of land in 1959, applied more than 5,500 catties of high-quality pig manure per mu of land, and at the same time, used more than 18,500 yuan from pig raising income to invest in agricultural production, so that grain production reached more than 1,000 catties per mu, an increase of 30% over 1958, and cotton production increased by 28%. The masses summarized the benefits of pig raising as one more turns into four more: more pig raising, more fertilizer accumulation, more production increase, and more income increase.
    The experience of Linru County in achieving one pig per mu of land has set an example for all parts of the province. The mass pig raising movement of learning from Linru and catching up with Linru has been vigorously launched throughout the province. We believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, as long as we adhere to continuous revolution and advance in victory, we will surely be able to push our province's pig raising industry to a new and greater climax.

    临汝的猪八个月增长十一倍
    刘名榜代表介绍河南临汝高速度地发展养猪事业各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委所作的各项报告。现在，我就高速度地发展养猪事业的问题，发表一点意见。
    几年来，河南省的养猪事业，同社会主义建设的其他事业一样，在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，获得了飞跃的发展。特别从毛主席和党中央在1959年冬季提出种植业与饲养业并重、猪为六畜之首、大力发展养猪事业的指示以后，一个全党全民大搞养猪事业的群众运动的新高潮，在全省范围内迅速形成。万头、千头、百头猪场，如雨后春荀般地兴建起来，生猪头数猛烈增长。到1960年2月底止，全省生猪存栏数已经达到一千八百万头。人民公社生产大队集体喂养的猪占80％以上。临汝县和另外的四十三个人民公社达到了一亩地一头猪；有十二个县、一百多个公社达到了每人平均一头猪。目前，全省以养猪为首，全面发展畜牧业的群众运动，正在以万马奔腾、波涛滚滚之势，迅猛地向前发展。
    临汝县是我省养猪事业方面的一面红旗，我现在着重谈一谈这个县的养猪情况。临汝县在1959年6月底的时候，还只有生猪九万多头，经过短短八个月的时间，到1960年2月底生猪存栏数达到了一百一十四万多头，增长了十一倍。
    高速度发展养猪事业，必须首先过好思想关
    临汝县为什么能够以这样高的速度发展了养猪事业呢？
    首先是由于坚持政治挂帅，进行不断革命的结果。临汝县生猪大发展的过程是两条道路、两种思想斗争的过程，是不断革命、不断前进的过程。当去年7月间中共临汝县委提出生猪发展到三十万头的计划以后，一场全民性的思想斗争立即展开了。斗争的焦点是：要不要种植业与饲养业并重？以公养为主，还是以私养为主？能不能高速度发展？过好“思想关”是高速度发展养猪事业的第一关。临汝县的各级党政领导，一方面运用许多农牧并举，相互促进，取得大丰收和高速度发展养猪事业的实例，发动群众，展开鸣放辩论，提高认识，启发群众养猪的积极性；另一方面，依靠群众，批判了在一部分干部和群众中存在的“养猪缺猪源”、“饲料问题无法解决”、怕猪死等等懦夫思想和怀疑集体能否养好猪、不相信群众等右倾保守思想。通过鸣放辩论，错误的思想被批判了，正确的思想树立了，养猪光荣、人人热爱养猪事业，成了新的社会风尚，父子争作饲养员、全家下猪场的新人新事，到处都可看到。由于思想问题解决的好，养猪的积极性大大提高了，经过从去年7月初到10月底一百多天的努力，生猪头数达到二十一万多头，比6月底九万多头翻了一番。第一个战役的胜利，鼓舞了群众的干劲。为了乘胜前进，临汝县党政领导，以不断革命的精神，紧接着提出了向一人一头猪的目标进军的口号。到去年12月底，生猪发展到四十多万头，第二个战役又胜利了，全县达到了每人平均一头猪。两次胜利使群众的干劲更大，不断革命，不断前进，到今年2月底，生猪发展到一百一十四万多头，达到了一亩地一头猪（全县耕地一百一十多万亩）。
    临汝县在八个月内达到一亩地一头猪的实践证明：大搞群众运动，发挥人民公社的优越性，是高速度发展养猪事业的决定关键。缺乏猪源，他们就依靠群众，依靠人民公社，坚持集体自繁自养的方针，开展“一猪十仔百孙”运动，社社队队建立生猪繁殖场，采取“见母就留”、先留后选的办法，大力发展了母猪群。现在，全县的母猪，已经由1959年7月中旬的四万六千多头猛增到二十六万三千多头，其中适龄母猪十三万三千多头。在繁殖方面，普遍推广了复配、热配、药物催情、人工授精等先进技术，大大提高了繁殖成活率。全县母猪每窝平均繁殖成活十点五头以上，基本上达到了全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮的要求，实现了“五全”县。并且出现了七千多头母猪每窝产仔十五头以上、四百多头母猪每窝产仔二十头以上的高产纪录。袁庄生产大队养猪场饲养员李水娃喂养的四十八头母猪，采取三配办法，平均每窝产仔三十头，其中有一头母猪一窝产仔四十二头。生猪大量繁殖后，确保饲料供应，是保证养猪事业继续发展的重要一环。他们坚决贯彻执行了以粗饲料为主的原则，采取采集、加工、贮备、种植同时并举的办法，大搞群众性的采集贮备饲料运动，大量 收集了粗饲料；以养猪场为中心，举办公社工业，实行一场带多场（粉厂、酒厂、醋厂）的办法，进行农副产品加工；并且利用小片荒地种植饲料，突破了饲料关。保证养猪事业高速度发展的另一个重要问题，是过好防疫关。在防疫方面，采取以土法为主，土洋结合，防、管、检、治并举的方法，全县共建立了三百三十七个土法制药厂，制造土猪药一百五十多种，培训兽医和防疫人员三千七百多名，社队建立兽医院，场场建立防疫室，形成了星罗棋布的防疫网，基本上控制和消灭了猪疫病的发生。
    依靠群众，大搞养猪技术革新、技术革命
    依靠群众，采取以土法为主、土洋并举两条腿走路的方针，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，是提高工效、高速度发展养猪事业的重要措施。临汝县大力地改良了饲养工具，采取就地取材、就地制造的办法，普遍推行的土制饲料粉碎机、快速磨、大搞了自来水塔、土制运输车、木轨道等半机械化饲养工具，使饲养员平均养猪定额达到一百二十头以上，提高了工效三倍以上。饲养员刘书芳创制的畜力快速磨，一天加工粗饲料七千多斤，提高工效十多倍。群众的发明创造丰富多彩，做到了人少喂猪多。
    加强党对养猪事业的具体领导，坚决贯彻执行“公养为主、公养私养并举”的方针和有关各项政策，是养猪事业持续跃进的根本保证。临汝县组织了五百多名县、社、队党委书记，下猪场搞“试验田”。组织一千五百多名干部深入基层，边养猪、边工作，以生产领导生产。同时，还组织了大检查大评比，总结先进经验，召开现场会议，开展“学、比、赶、帮”竞赛运动，促进了养猪事业的飞跃发展。
    养猪事业的大发展，对于农业生产的持续跃进和改善人民的生活已经开始显示了重要的作用。从1959年冬季以来，全县积了大量的猪肥，麦田追肥比任何一年都多。1960年1、2月份出售肥猪二万五千多头，不仅支援了国家建设，而且增加收入十万多元。袁庄大队，在1959年就实现了一亩地一头猪，猪多肥就多，加上其他措施，取得了粮食大丰收，由缺粮队一跃而为余粮队。郭庄大队1959年平均一亩地合二点四头猪，每亩地施优质猪粪五千五百多斤，同时，用养猪的收入一万八千五百多元投入农业生产，使粮食产量每亩地达到一千多斤，比1958年增长30％，棉花增产28％。群众总结养猪的好处是一多变四多：养猪多、积肥多、增产多、收入多。
    临汝县实现一亩地一头猪的经验，给全省各地树立了榜样，学临汝、赶临汝的群众性的养猪运动，已经在全省范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来。我们相信，在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，只要坚持不断革命，乘胜前进，一定能够把我省的养猪事业推向新的更大的高潮。
