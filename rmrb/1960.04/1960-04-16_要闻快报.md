Hunan Mobilizes Masses to Protect and Promote Rice Seedlings

Hunan province is taking emergency measures to launch a mass campaign to protect and promote early rice seedlings.

This year, the sowing of early rice in Hunan Province was appropriately advanced compared to previous years. Recently, due to prolonged cold snaps and rainy weather, seedling rot has occurred in some areas. In Changde Prefecture, 130,000 mu of rice paddies have been affected by cotton rot disease and chironomid larvae. Over 800,000 commune members throughout the area have been mobilized to protect and promote seedlings. Currently, over 790,000 mu of rice paddies throughout the region have been sprayed with Bordeaux mixture to prevent and control pests and diseases, basically stopping the rot and enabling transplanting to proceed as originally planned. Xiangtan, Hengyang, Shaoyang Prefectures and the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture are also actively protecting and promoting seedlings.

Inner Mongolia Expands Spring Wheat by 90,000 Mu

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, one of China's main spring wheat producing areas, has basically completed its spring wheat sowing plan. Statistics up to the 13th show that the region has sown over 8,490,000 mu of spring wheat, an increase of over 90,000 mu compared to last year's spring wheat sowing area.

Mengjin Builds Large Central Canteens

Mengjin County, Henan Province, is building large central canteens to drive the surrounding canteens, connecting the county's canteens into a canteen network.

Currently, in Mengjin County, one out of every four canteens is a central canteen. The experience of the central canteens is immediately passed on to the surrounding canteens, and the experience of other canteens further promotes the development of the central canteens. The county has also established 129 cooking night schools centered around the central canteens to improve the quality of cooking staff's meals.

Anguo Communes Hold Accountancy Competitions

Financial accountants from communes and production teams in Anguo County, Hebei Province, held "accountancy competition" meetings, launching a red flag emulation movement in commune financial work.

The main content of the competition is closing old accounts and establishing new accounts. Specific competition and evaluation contents include "Three Haves" (expenditures have approval, income and expenses have plans, monthly reports are available), "Four Matches" (receipts match accounts, general ledger matches detailed ledger, brigade accounts match team accounts, accounts match reports).

The accountancy competition effectively improved the ideological and professional levels of financial accountants in the county's communes and teams, enabling communes and production teams to use funds more rationally, make timely distribution work, and implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the commune.

Zhangcha Commune Basically Achieves Semi-Mechanization in Ten Days

Workers in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, are actively supporting agriculture. They concentrated their efforts and fought alongside commune members of the Zhangcha Commune in the suburbs for ten days, enabling Zhangcha Commune to basically achieve semi-mechanization and partial mechanization and electrification in irrigation and drainage, transportation, grain and feed processing, pig raising, canteens, and lighting.

The commune now possesses 19 electric motors and internal combustion engines, totaling 1,125 horsepower. Electric irrigation and drainage covers 90% of all farmland; vehicle and boat transportation accounts for 80% of total transportation volume; electric machinery is used for grain and feed processing. This series of technological innovation achievements is equivalent to adding 3,500 laborers per year, equivalent to adding 45% of the labor force to the entire commune.

Xuanwei Dongshan Commune Builds Large "Underground Reservoirs"

In this year's fight against drought, the Dongshan People's Commune in Xuanwei County, Yunnan, built 27 "underground reservoirs," increasing the commune's irrigated area by more than 3,000 mu.

This year's drought in Dongshan Commune was particularly severe, with riverbeds drying up. Based on the experience of older people, there might be water under the riverbed, so it was decided to cut off the river to extract water. Sure enough, springs of clear water were dug out, and then dividing walls were built in the riverbed to block the water, making them underground reservoirs. The water from these underground reservoirs can be drawn out with waterwheels and water dragons to irrigate the fields.

Sheng County Collects and Stores Grass Seeds for Pig Feed

Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, is actively preparing to ensile grass seeds to meet the needs of the rapid development of pig raising.

It is understood that 50,000 jin of grass seeds have the nutritional value equivalent to 10,000 jin of rice bran. To this end, the county party committee convened a special meeting to deploy the work of collecting and storing grass seeds. This year, the county requires the storage of 800 million jin of grass seeds, so that each pig averages 220 jin of grass seeds as feed. Currently, communes are arranging labor, harvesting locations, and storage cellars.

Progress in Extracting Nitrogen from the Air

In promoting the advanced experience of the Deng County Bai Niu Commune Chemical Plant in Henan Province in using indigenous methods to extract nitrogen from the air, Mi County, Henan Province, carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, using ceramics instead of steel and improving equipment, achieving the goal of building furnaces without steel, using raw materials without alkali, and hydrolyzing without high pressure, greatly improving the output and quality of ammonium sulfate (fertilizer). At present, the improved equipment has increased from producing one ton of ammonium sulfate per day to five tons, with a nitrogen content stable at over 5%.
