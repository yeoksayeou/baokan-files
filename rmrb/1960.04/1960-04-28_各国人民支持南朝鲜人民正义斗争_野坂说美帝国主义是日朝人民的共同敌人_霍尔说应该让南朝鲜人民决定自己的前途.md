Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 20th: The Soviet "Izvestia" published a commentary today stating that the large-scale mass demonstrations in Seoul against the rule of Syngman Rhee foreshadow the inevitable collapse of the South Korean regime, which is propped up by domestic and American bayonets.

The commentary said that Syngman Rhee's Western supporters and protectors are trying to convince the public that American troops are stationed in South Korea to prevent so-called "Northern aggression." The commentary stated that Syngman Rhee needs foreign troops to maintain his regime and rectify the "order" in South Korea, which is difficult to control.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 27th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka published a statement in "Akahata" today, supporting the patriotic and just struggle launched by the South Korean people.

Nosaka pointed out that the Syngman Rhee fascist dictatorial regime, which relies on the support of American imperialism and does everything possible to oppress the South Korean people, is beginning to collapse in the face of the South Korean people's heroic struggle against dark politics. This is the inevitable fate of national traitors. Obviously, the root cause of South Korea's current dark situation lies in American imperialism.

Nosaka expressed that the Japanese Communist Party fully supports the just struggle of the Korean people, opposes the US government and military's interference in the South Korean people's struggle, demands the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and sincerely hopes for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Nosaka emphasized that Japan is currently in a state of semi-occupation by the United States. Therefore, American imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 22nd: TASS, New York, April 22nd: American Communist Party General Secretary Gus Hall issued a statement to the press regarding the South Korean people's struggle against US-Rhee rule.

The statement said that the US State Department's belated and hypocritical "condemnation" of the "repressive measures taken by the Syngman Rhee government, which are not suitable for a free democratic country," "cannot cover up America's responsibility for the brutal suppression of the South Korean people."

The statement concluded, "The struggle of the South Korean people will continue. American workers should give their full support, first by demanding the withdrawal of American troops hiding under the guise of the easily recognizable United Nations forces. Take American weapons away from Syngman Rhee's executioners. Let the South Korean people decide their own future."

    各国人民支持南朝鲜人民正义斗争
    野坂说美帝国主义是日朝人民的共同敌人
    霍尔说应该让南朝鲜人民决定自己的前途
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联“消息报”今天发表评论说，在汉城爆发的反对李承晚统治的大规模群众示威，预示着依靠国内和美国的刺刀来扶持的南朝鲜政权的不可避免的崩溃。
    评论说，李承晚的西方支持者和庇护人企图使公众相信，美国军队驻扎在南朝鲜是为了防止所谓的“北方侵略”。评论说，李承晚需要外国军队是为了维持自己的政权和整顿难以控制的南朝鲜的“秩序”。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，支持南朝鲜人民掀起的爱国正义斗争。
    野坂指出，依靠美帝国主义撑腰、对南朝鲜人民极尽暴虐之能事的李承晚法西斯独裁政权，在南朝鲜人民反对黑暗政治、奋起展开英勇斗争的情况下正在开始崩溃。这是民族叛徒必然的命运。显然，南朝鲜今天的黑暗状况的根源在于美帝国主义。
    野坂表示，日本共产党全面支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争，反对美国政府和美军干涉南朝鲜人民的斗争，要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜，并且衷心希望实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    野坂强调指出，日本目前处于美国的半占领状态下。因此，美帝国主义是日朝两国人民的共同敌人。
    据新华社22日电　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：美国共产党总书记葛斯·霍尔就南朝鲜人民反对美李统治的斗争向报界发表声明。
    声明说，美国国务院对李承晚政府采取的“不适合于一个自由的民主国家的镇压措施”所作的迟迟而来的、伪善的“谴责”，“决不能掩盖美国对残酷镇压南朝鲜人民应负的责任。”
    声明最后说，“南朝鲜人民的斗争将继续下去。美国工人应该全力支持，首先是要求撤退打着人们一眼就可以识破的联合国军幌子的美国军队。把美国的武器从李承晚的刽子手手里拿走。让南朝鲜人民决定他们自己的前途。”
