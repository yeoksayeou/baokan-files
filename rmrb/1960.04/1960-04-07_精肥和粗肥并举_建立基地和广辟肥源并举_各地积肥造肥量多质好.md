Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: After the rural people's communes implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of emphasizing both concentrated and coarse manure, and emphasizing both establishing fertilizer bases and expanding manure sources, the progress of accumulating and producing manure has been rapid, the quantity is large, and the quality is good. This has not only prepared a large amount of topdressing fertilizer for this year's summer harvest crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and summer grains, but also prepared enough base fertilizer for the current spring-sown crops.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the various fertilizers accumulated in provinces such as Jiangsu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, in addition to being used for topdressing wheat and rapeseed, can generally be applied to spring-sown crops at an average rate of about 10,000 catties per mu, an increase of 30% to 50% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the proportion of high-quality human and animal manure has greatly increased compared to previous years. In sixteen provinces and regions (cities) including Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Shandong, Henan, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, the fertilizer that has been sent to the fields accounts for 70% of the total accumulated fertilizer, of which more than 80% of the fertilizer in provinces such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi has been sent to the fields. This has laid a solid material foundation for striving for continuous leaps forward in agricultural production this year.

The characteristics of the nationwide manure accumulation and production movement are that it is grasped tightly, grasped early, on a large scale, develops rapidly, and has significant results. Hebei Province used to start the winter manure accumulation movement after November, but in 1959, it had already accumulated 300 billion catties of fertilizer by November. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in Jiangsu Province to date exceeds the provincial plan by nearly one time, an increase of one and a half times compared to the same period last year.

In the manure accumulation and production movement, all regions have prominently grasped the construction of fertilizer bases centered on raising pigs to accumulate manure. All parts of the country have warmly responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have launched a large-scale high tide of raising pigs to accumulate manure. The number of pigs has increased rapidly. By the end of last year, the total number of pigs reached 180 million. In January and February of this year, the net increase in just six provinces, including Sichuan, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Anhui, was more than five million. Due to the rapid development of pigs, the quality of fertilizer has greatly improved. In provinces such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Guangdong, and Jilin, better fertilizers account for more than 50% of the accumulated fertilizer.

While vigorously grasping pig raising to accumulate manure, all regions have also paid attention to the planting and management of green manure. The amount of green manure planted in various regions last winter was more than in any previous year. After planting, management was strengthened in a timely manner, so the growth of green manure crops was better than in previous years.

Changde County, Hunan, adopted the management method of "three earlies, three follow-ups, and one thorough" (three earlies are early sowing, early ditching, and early topdressing; three follow-ups are follow-up seedling-raising fertilizer, follow-up seedling-protection fertilizer, and follow-up seedling-promoting fertilizer; one thorough is thorough ditching to drain water.) in the cultivation of green manure, making the growth of green manure generally good, and preparing a good base fertilizer for early rice transplanting.

All regions attach great importance to the production of native chemical fertilizers. More than 80,000 native chemical fertilizer plants have been established in nine provinces, including Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Shanxi, producing tens of billions of catties of native chemical fertilizers. After exploration, all regions have summarized and promoted the three key experiences of high yield, high quality, and low cost in the production of native chemical fertilizers, and carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, so that native chemical fertilizers have greatly improved in quality, quantity, and variety, and have saved labor and reduced production costs.

While vigorously carrying out the construction of fertilizer bases, all regions have, as in previous years, widely opened up fertilizer sources, so that household manure goes out, wild manure returns to the fields, mountain manure goes down the mountains, and river and sea manure goes ashore, thus accumulating and producing a large amount of natural fertilizer (i.e., miscellaneous soil fertilizer). In mid-March, Zhejiang Province mobilized 3 million people every day to go up the mountains and down the rivers, opening up fertilizer sources widely according to local conditions, and accumulating and producing a large amount of miscellaneous soil fertilizer. A mass movement to create grass pond mud was launched in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province. By mid-February, more than 900,000 grass pond mud ponds had been dug in the fields, with an average of one pond for every six mu of land, and every pond was full of fertilizer.

    精肥和粗肥并举　建立基地和广辟肥源并举
    各地积肥造肥量多质好
    据新华社6日讯　农村人民公社实行精肥和粗肥并举、建立肥料基地和广辟肥源并举的两条腿走路的方针以后，使积肥造肥进度快，数量多，质量好。这不仅为今年的夏收作物小麦、油菜和夏杂粮等准备了大量的追肥，而且还为当前的春播作物准备了足够的底肥。
    据农业部统计，江苏、广东、广西、河南、山西、陕西等省所积的各种肥料，除供小麦、油菜追肥外，一般春播作物平均每亩可施肥万斤左右，比去年同期增加30％到50％，而且质量好的人畜肥所占的比重比往年大大增加。北京、河北、内蒙古、黑龙江、青海、山东、河南、福建、湖南、广东、广西、云南等十六个省区（市）已送到田里的肥料占积肥总量的70％，其中吉林、黑龙江、河南、湖南、江西等省80％以上的肥料已送到田里。这为争取今年农业生产连续跃进打下了雄厚的物质基础。
    全民积肥造肥运动的特点是抓得紧，抓得早，规模大，发展快，收效显著。河北省往年11月以后才开展冬季积肥运动，而1959年到11月就已经积了三千亿斤肥料。江苏省到目前为止积的肥料超过省计划近一倍，比去年同期增加一倍半。
    各地在积肥造肥运动中，突出地抓住了以养猪积肥为中心的肥料基地的建设工作，全国各地热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，掀起了一个规模宏大的养猪积肥高潮，猪的头数增长很快，到去年年底猪的总头数达到一亿八千万头，今年1、2两月，仅四川、河南、湖南、山东、黑龙江、安徽等六个省就净增了五百多万头。由于猪只的迅速发展，肥料的质量大大提高。山西、陕西、河南、广东、吉林等省较好的肥料占已积肥的50％以上。
    在大抓养猪积肥的同时，各地还注意了绿肥的种植和管理工作。去冬各地种植的绿肥，比以往任何一年都多，种下之后，又及时地加强了管理，因此绿肥作物生长比往年好。
    湖南常德县在培育绿肥方面采取了“三早、三追、一彻底”（三早即早播、早开沟、早追肥，三追即追提苗肥、追保苗肥、追催苗肥，一彻底即开沟沥水彻底。）的管理办法，使绿肥生长普遍良好，为早稻插秧准备下了良好的底肥。
    各地对土化肥的生产很重视。辽宁、江西、山西等九个省就建立土化肥厂八万多个，生产出土化肥几百亿斤。各地经过摸索，总结出土化肥生产高产、优质、低成本三大关键的经验加以推广，并进行技术革新和技术革命，使土化肥无论在质量、数量和品种上，都有了很大的提高，并节省了劳力，降低了生产成本。
    在大搞肥料基地建设的同时，各地像往年一样广泛开辟肥源，使家肥出门，野肥归田，山肥下山，河肥、海肥上岸，因而积造了大量的自然肥（即土杂肥）。浙江省在3月中旬每天出动三百万人上山下河，因地制宜，广开肥源，积造了大量的土杂肥。江苏省苏州专区掀起造草塘泥的群众运动，到2月中旬在田头挖草塘泥潭九十多万个，平均每六亩地就有一个，潭潭满肥。
