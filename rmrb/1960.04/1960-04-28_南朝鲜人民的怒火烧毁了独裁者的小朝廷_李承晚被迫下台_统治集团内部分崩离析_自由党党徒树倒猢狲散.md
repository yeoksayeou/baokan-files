Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th -- Seoul News: Under the heavy blow of the surging struggle of the South Korean people, Syngman Rhee, the agent of U.S. imperialism in its rule over South Korea and the dictator who carried out twelve years of fascist terror rule in South Korea, was forced to announce his resignation today.

　　He submitted his resignation to the South Korean "National Assembly" this afternoon, saying: "I, Syngman Rhee, have decided to accept the resolution of the National Assembly and resign from the post of president."

　　According to foreign news agencies, Syngman Rhee has "disappeared." It is said that he has secretly left Seoul and gone into hiding. Now, the "Presidential Palace" is empty.

　　Under the strong pressure of the mass struggle, the South Korean "National Assembly" passed a resolution yesterday demanding that Syngman Rhee resign immediately.

　　Prior to this, the "cabinet ministers" of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime had already resigned en masse on the 21st. The Syngman Rhee puppet "cabinet" has collapsed.

　　Under the planning of the United States, the pro-American new "Foreign Minister" Heo Jeong announced today that he would serve as "Acting President." Heo Jeong said at a press conference that he would maintain "closer" economic and military relations with the United States. He stated that he would organize a three-month "caretaker cabinet" and then transfer power to a new "government."

　　As previously reported, in order to maintain its colonial rule in South Korea, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, supported the Syngman Rhee clique in its bloody suppression of South Korean demonstrators, and on the other hand, repeatedly held secret talks with Syngman Rhee to plan the implementation of the so-called "responsible cabinet system" and, in the event of absolute necessity, allow Syngman Rhee to step down, etc., in an attempt to deceive the people, paralyze the people's struggle, and use the method of changing the soup but not the medicine to support a new puppet regime and maintain U.S. colonial rule.

　　However, the struggle of the South Korean people is still developing. In Busan today, hundreds more people held demonstrations against the U.S.-Rhee clique.

　　Under the impact of the tide of people's struggle, the South Korean ruling clique is falling apart. The Syngman Rhee's cronies, who were gathered together by the goal of vying for power and profit, are now "scattering when the tree falls." The South Korean "National Assembly" passed another resolution today demanding that Syngman Rhee's number one accomplice, Lee Ki-poong, resign from the post of "Speaker of the National Assembly," and demanding that the other seven major "members" of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party resign immediately. Lee Cheol-ho, the Vice-Speaker of the "National Assembly" of the Liberal Party, has been forced to resign. Han Hee-seok, a member of the Central Policy Committee of the Liberal Party and the person in charge of the "March 15" fake election, has also announced his resignation from his post as a "member of the National Assembly." Cho Yong-sun, the "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court" of South Korea, as well as the Syngman Rhee clique's "ambassadors" to the United States and Japan, have also submitted their resignations.

　　Some of the Syngman Rhee clique's party and government organs were destroyed by the masses, and some were burned down. Those that were not destroyed were quietly closed. The police agencies of the Syngman Rhee clique in many places have been paralyzed. On the 26th, a large number of police officers in Seoul fearfully took off their black police uniforms. In Incheon, Daejeon, Daegu, and other places, some police officers, under the pressure of the masses, adopted a bystander attitude towards the demonstrations. Many police stations and outposts in Seoul, Busan, and other places were destroyed or burned by the masses.

　　It was reported that during the 500,000-person demonstration in Seoul on the 26th, although the 15th Division of the Lee puppet army, which was transferred to Seoul to suppress the people, deployed troops at all major locations, they did not dare to carry out more barbaric suppression of the massive demonstration.

    南朝鲜人民的怒火烧毁了独裁者的小朝廷
    李承晚被迫下台
    统治集团内部分崩离析　自由党党徒树倒猢狲散
    据新华社平壤27日电　汉城消息：在南朝鲜人民汹涌澎湃的斗争的沉重打击下，美帝国主义统治南朝鲜的代理人、在南朝鲜进行了十二年法西斯恐怖统治的独裁者——李承晚今天被迫宣告下台。
    他在今天下午向南朝鲜“国会”提出辞呈说：“我，李承晚已经决定接受国会的决议，辞去总统的职务。”
    据外国通讯社报道，李承晚已经“下落不明”。据说，他已经偷偷地离开汉城躲藏起来了。现在，“总统府”的房子里空无一人。
    在群众斗争的强大的压力下，南朝鲜“国会”曾经在昨天通过一项决议，要求李承晚立即辞职。
    在这以前，李承晚伪政权的“内阁部长”们已经在21日集体辞职。李承晚傀儡“内阁”已经垮台。
    在美国的策划下，亲美的新任“外交部长官”许政今天宣布担任“代理总统”。许政在记者招待会上说：他要同美国保持“更加亲密的”经济和军事关系。他表示要组织一个为时三个月的“看守内阁”，然后把政权移交给新的“政府”。
    前已报道，美帝国主义为了维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治，一方面支持李承晚集团对南朝鲜示威群众进行血腥镇压，另一方面一再同李承晚举行秘密会谈，策划实行所谓“责任内阁制”，在万不得已的情况下让李承晚下台等办法，企图借以欺骗人民、麻痹人民的斗争，用换汤不换药的办法扶植新的傀儡政权，保持美国的殖民统治。
    然而，南朝鲜人民的斗争还在发展。釜山市，今天又有数百人举行了反对美李集团的示威游行。
    在人民斗争浪潮的冲击下，南朝鲜统治集团内部分崩离析。在争权夺利的目标下纠成一伙的李承晚的党徒们现在是“树倒猢狲散”。南朝鲜“国会”今天又通过决议，要求李承晚的头号帮凶李起鹏辞去“国会议长”的职务，并且要求李承晚的自由党的另外七个主要“议员”立即辞职。自由党的“国会”副议长任哲镐已经被迫辞职。自由党的中央政策委员、“三·一五”伪选举的负责人韩熙锡也已经宣布辞掉“国会”议员职务。南朝鲜“大法院院长”赵容淳以及李承晚集团驻美国和日本的“大使”也都提出了辞呈。
    李承晚集团的党政机关，有的被群众捣毁，有的被焚烧。没有被捣毁的也都悄悄地闭上大门。许多地方的李承晚集团的警察机构已经陷于瘫痪状态。26日，汉城市大批警察恐惧地脱下了黑色的警察制服。仁川、大田、大丘等地，有些警察迫于群众的声威，对示威采取旁观的态度。汉城、釜山等地的许多警察署和派出所被群众捣毁或焚毁。
    据报道，26日汉城五十万人大示威时，被调来汉城镇压人民的李伪军十五师团虽然在各主要地点都布置了军队，但不敢对声势浩大的示威群众进行更野蛮的镇压行动。
