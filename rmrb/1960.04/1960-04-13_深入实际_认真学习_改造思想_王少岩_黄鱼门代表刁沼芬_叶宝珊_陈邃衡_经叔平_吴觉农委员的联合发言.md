The "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian have shown us a magnificent and splendid picture of the motherland's continued leap forward. We are extremely excited and express our heartfelt support. We fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

Through the visits, our various erroneous ideas about whether we can continue to leap forward have been effectively clarified. At the same time, we have a clearer understanding that socialist construction has entered a new stage, and the face of the country is undergoing rapid changes.

The seven of us are all studying at the Socialist Academy. Before the meeting, in order to consolidate and improve our gains from studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and to help us further carry out self-remolding in political thought, the leaders of the National Committee of the CPPCC and the Academy organized us to visit the Northeast. This visit lasted twenty days, reaching seven cities in the three northeastern provinces. We visited more than thirty units, focusing on heavy industrial factories and mining enterprises, and also visited a few light industrial and commercial units and individual urban people's communes. This visit gave us an extremely profound and vivid real education of the Three Great Banners, a socialist real education. The three northeastern provinces, like all parts of the country, are vigorously carrying out a magnificent and massive mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation under the leadership of the Party. From Liaoning to Heilongjiang, from Heilongjiang to Jilin, from heavy industrial factories and mining enterprises with tens of thousands of employees to grain and oil shops with only three or four employees, from research and design institutions to nurseries, kindergartens, and service stations run by street offices, from skilled workers to housewives who have just started production work, no matter in which corner, regardless of men, women, old or young, what we see is the heroic spirit of "everyone contributing ideas, everything being innovated, everyone offering treasures, creating every day" and the joyful scene of frequent good news and joy. New deeds and new people are emerging in the thousands. Tens of thousands of rationalization proposals for technical innovation and technical revolution, the realization of tens of thousands of mechanization and automation projects, and tens of thousands of innovation experts and heroes are not only rapidly changing the production technology of the enterprises and units we visited, but also enabling these enterprises and units to win the good situation of a good start, a monthly red, and a full house red in the spring of the first year of the 1960s. It is truly a great situation of "red thought, red innovation, and red production." All this makes us deeply feel that our country is in a great time of unity of purpose, galloping horses, colorful flowers, and renewal of everything. We truly feel that "the situation is infinitely good, and the country is all red."

Such a profound feeling gave us great encouragement and also had a great impact on our thinking.

We have achieved certain gains in studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in the Socialist Academy. However, when we went to visit the Northeast, there were still many problems in our thinking. Although studying swept away our doubts about the two consecutive great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, and we also realized the complete correctness of the Party's general line, in the depths of our minds, we still had doubts to varying degrees about whether the great leap forward could be sustained. Some people think that the great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 were facts, and the achievements were huge, but they always felt that their achievements were achieved by hard work, so how could they last year after year? Some people think that the foundation is small, so it can be turned over. After two years of great leap forward, the foundation has become larger, and the leap forward is difficult. Some people think that factories with backward equipment can explore potential through transformation, and modern factories have already been highly mechanized and automated. Is there still much potential to be tapped? This series of ideas essentially reflects the existence of varying degrees of doubt about the continuous leap forward in our thinking.

It was not until this visit that we realized that these ideas were wrong.

In this visit, the first thing we felt was: the revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit of the working masses, and the communist style of daring to think and act. We saw that they were high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, full of spring breeze, and full of joy. They regard this technical innovation and technical revolution movement as their second liberation after they turned over politically and economically. Through hard work and ingenuity, they have liberated themselves from the heavy physical labor that has been pressing on the working people for thousands of years, and truly become the masters of machines and the masters of the world. From the Fushun Coal Mine to the Dalian Port, from the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant to the restaurants in Harbin, we saw that they put down their shovels, threw away their shoulder pads, threw away their sledgehammers, and threw away their kitchen knives. The porters sang: "In the past, we used our shoulders to carry things, sweating all over our faces and sore backs and legs. Now we have implemented continuous lines, and every worker is smiling." The grinding workers sang: "In the past, three and a half circles made us sweat all over. Now we press the button, and people sit and the machine turns." The employees in the restaurant also sang: "No need to walk to deliver dishes, no need to cut vegetables by hand, no need to knead the dough, everything is done by pressing the button." From their poems, we can see their happy and cheerful mood. We saw that the happiness they have today did not come from nowhere, but from their hard work and hard work. More than 1,000 workers in the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory abandoned returning home for the Spring Festival in order to ensure the glorious task of doubling production this year, and made great efforts in mechanization and automation. They returned the train tickets they had originally bought during the Spring Festival holiday. During the Spring Festival holiday, they created four automatic lines and 39 single-machine automations. This huge achievement laid the foundation for the factory to achieve full automation before the "May Day" holiday, ensuring that the factory's production will be doubled again this year on the basis of the continuous leap forward in 1958 and 1959 without increasing personnel. For example, making screw caps originally required the process of ten old machine tools. After the transformation, only three machine tools are needed, which are continuousized and become fully automatic. Originally, 13 people were required to operate, but now only three people are needed and the output is doubled. The workers in the factory said after creating the automatic line: "Such a Spring Festival is truly meaningful and a happy Spring Festival." We saw that the reason why they "engage in production during the day and grasp transformation (technical transformation) at night," such selfless labor, day and night, is just as the workers themselves said, it is for long-term happiness, "a hundred days of hard work, ten thousand years of sweetness," "one day of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." This truly reflects their urgent desire to get rid of China's "poverty and blankness" and build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country as soon as possible. It is also a full manifestation of the working masses being masters of their own affairs and the master's thinking. It makes us realize that the great leaps forward in the past two years and the continuous great leaps forward this year and in the future are the result of the working masses and the broad masses of working people, under the leadership of the Party, exerting their utmost efforts and striving for the top; it is the result of the working class realizing their lofty ideals of building socialism and communism, liberating all mankind, and liberating themselves; it is the result of their liberating their minds, breaking superstitions, establishing lofty ambitions, and establishing a communist style of daring to think and act under the guidance of the Party's general line and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Ideological liberation, technological innovation, production doubling, further ideological liberation, further technological innovation, and production have been further leaped forward. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel said well: "If you work hard, you will travel a thousand miles a day. If you are clever, you will leap again and again."

During the visit, the cities and factories we visited all achieved continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 without exception. Therefore, in terms of foundation, they have indeed expanded many times over. Taking the Harbin Electric Motor Factory as an example, their output value is 100% in 1957, 300% in 1958, and 500% in 1959, while this year's target is still to double that of 1959, that is to say, 1000% of 1957. They are not only doubling in production value. From the perspective of the locomotive production of the Dalian Locomotive Factory, taking the output in 1957 as 100%, it was 185% in 1958, 243% in 1959, and 412% in 1960. Like the Harbin Electric Motor Factory, while doubling production, the factory also manufactures new high, large, precise, and cutting-edge products.

Their great continuous leap forward indicators and the huge achievements already achieved in the first quarter educated us: The foundation has become larger, and the foundation has become thicker, which brings more favorable and more powerful conditions and material forces for the continuous leap forward in the future, not more difficulties. The great leap forward in the past two years has enabled them to master rich experience and have a more solid material and technical foundation than in the past. More importantly, due to the victory of the great leap forward in the previous two years, the working masses have transformed their subjective world in the struggle to transform the objective world, and changed their ideological and spiritual outlook; their revolutionary enthusiasm and the communist style of daring to think and act have been further promoted in the victory of the continuous leap forward. The conclusion drawn by the workers of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Factory, "The more you think, the more you dare to do, the more you do, the more you dare to think, the more you think the more you dare to think, the more you do the more you dare to do, the higher you think, the bigger you do," powerfully clarifies our wrong ideas.

During the visit, we not only saw the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory, which was basically a manual operation and backward and old equipment, using the method of ants gnawing bones in 1958 to transform the old equipment, and manufacturing more than 100 indigenous machines in 1959, making the factory a fully automated factory before the "May Day" holiday this year. But also saw the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Factory, a modern new factory, also made great changes and made great efforts to comprehensively change the technological appearance of enterprise production since it launched a general attack, and has achieved the goal of one factory turning into four factories, and is now advancing towards the grand goal of one factory turning into five factories. Indeed, the equipment of Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Factory is modern, but from what we saw during the visit, there is still a lot to be done in terms of mechanization and automation. Not only that, but also in operation technology, product design, process route, production organization and other aspects of innovation and revolution are endless. All this made us realize that so-called modernization is also relative. Everything is not static but developing. What is modern today still needs to be continuously improved and improved. Technological innovation is endless, and production potential is endless. This is in line with the law of continuous development and change of things.

In short, this visit has effectively clarified our various forms of erroneous ideas about doubting whether the continuous leap forward can be sustained, and at the same time made us more clearly realize that socialist construction in our country has entered a new stage, and the face of our country is undergoing rapid changes.

We deeply feel the fierce momentum, rapid development, large scale, and high efficiency of this technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and automation. This movement has only been carried out in the Northeast for a few months, and individual cities only officially launched it after the Spring Festival this year. However, by mid-February, 90% of the employees in Liaoning Province had invested in this movement, put forward 1.25 million rationalization proposals, and 300,000 have been implemented and achieved results. The remaining 900,000 are also being actively tested. Harbin City has proposed to achieve "one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand" this year (one hundred automated workshops, one thousand automatic lines, and ten thousand single-machine automations). By February, 195 automatic production lines, 520 single-machine automations, more than 1,000 retrofitted belt machine tools, and more than 4,000 manual operation mechanization projects have been completed. The implementation of these thousands of rationalization proposals has greatly improved labor productivity, saved raw materials, equipment, and investment, and improved labor conditions, thereby guaranteeing the completion and overfulfillment of national targets.

We saw that this movement not only bloomed and bore fruit in industry, but also spread to basic construction, transportation, government agencies, schools, scientific research and design institutions, shops, hotels, canteens, banks, and street people's communes. Under the leadership of the Party, the employees of the Shenyang Aluminum Magnesium Design Institute created equipment for the electrification of design calculation work through the "three combinations." The new calculation table they made only requires an ordinary designer to operate by pressing a button, and it can complete the workload that senior designers could only complete in two weeks in two hours. On February 15 this year, they completed the design task for the entire year of 1960 ten and a half months ahead of schedule. The Sanba Restaurant in Harbin is a restaurant that was developed from a canteen set up by ten housewives more than a year ago. Through great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, they created vegetable cutting machines, automatic dumpling production lines, and aerial food delivery machines, which greatly improved work efficiency and reduced physical labor. The employees felt happy and the customers felt satisfied. An ordinary worker at the Changchun Automobile Factory created a method of using radio to control the operation of overhead cranes. In Dalian, we saw that the fertilizer factory with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons was making great efforts in technological revolution and doubling production. At the same time, we also saw that the employees of the Dalian Chemical Plant overcame difficult technical problems and created the world's first small-scale synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 800 tons, which also exerted great power in supporting agricultural production.

Everything we saw made us feel that this great movement has formed a mass movement of the whole people. This movement is not only an innovation in general operations, but also a revolution in technology, a revolution in materials, and a revolution in products. It is not only a revolutionary movement in production, but also a revolutionary movement in thinking. Although it is only the beginning, it is rapidly changing the production technology of all factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions, and at the same time it is also rapidly changing the ideological and spiritual outlook of all people. These rapid changes have also brought about rapid changes in the face of our entire country.

The mentality of "**I**" first and half-heartedness is something we must get rid of. The mentality of "**public**" first and wholeheartedly of the working masses is the example we should learn from. "**I**" first will inevitably lead to nothing, and putting politics in command will inevitably lead to a bright future.

These profound feelings have made us further realize that the leadership of the Party is the truth, and have further made us realize that Mao Zedong Thought has been mastered, and hundreds of millions of people have generated immense and invincible material strength. This is the fundamental guarantee for the sustained leap forward of socialist construction in our country. The great achievements in socialist construction are the great victory of the Party's leadership and the vigorous mass movement; the great victory of the general line and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs; and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.

Like the people of the whole country, we fully believe that under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the 1960 national economic plan will be completed and overfulfilled, and socialist construction in our country will surely achieve a sustained and comprehensive great leap forward.

This visit has made us further see the difference between ourselves and the working masses, and further clarify the specific content of self-transformation. We have seen that the working masses' attitude towards the leadership of the Party is that wherever the Party points, they rush there, "As long as the Party puts up a ladder, we will go to heaven to pick the moon"; they are full of enthusiasm and high spirits. In front of them, there are no insurmountable difficulties. They say: "Yugong removing the mountain is too slow, we must learn from Erlang to carry the mountain on our shoulders," "Three don'ts (don't ask the state for funds, equipment, or materials), production must be doubled"; if there are no materials, find them yourself, if there is no equipment, make it yourself; they are never satisfied with the achievements they have made, and are always full of the spirit of continuous revolution. They say: "Add strength to strength, add skill to skill, make innovation, and seize every minute and second"; they are selfless, helpful, and don't care about rewards or conditions. They leave the difficulties to themselves and give the convenience to others. They are full of the communist style of mutual assistance and cooperation. In connection with ourselves, there are doubts, worries, wavering, and insufficient enthusiasm to varying degrees; we want to do it, but we are afraid to do it; we are afraid of difficulties, afraid of tension, and afraid of lacking technology; if there is a little progress, a little achievement, we think "it's almost there" and we can "take a break." In summary, we are "**I**" first and half-hearted; the working masses are "**public**" first and wholeheartedly. Therefore, it makes us more clearly realize that the mentality of "**I**" first and half-heartedness is something we must get rid of; the mentality of "**public**" first and wholeheartedly of the working masses is the example we should learn from. "**I**" first will inevitably lead to nothing, and putting politics in command will inevitably lead to a bright future.

The inspiring reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian have given us great encouragement and strength. We are determined to conscientiously implement the Party's education policy during the study period, conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, connect with our thinking, connect with reality, strive to transform our bourgeois stand and worldview, and after graduating from the study, we will return to our respective work posts and actively participate in the increase production and conservation movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and contribute all our strength to the socialist cause.

    深入实际　认真学习　改造思想
    王少岩　黄鱼门代表刁沼芬　叶宝珊  陈邃衡　经叔平  吴觉农委员的联合发言
    李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，使我们看到了祖国一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的图画，我们感到无比的兴奋，表示衷心的拥护。我们完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的政协常务委员会工作报告。
    通过参观，有力地澄清了我们对是否能继续跃进的各种错误思想，同时更清楚地认识到社会主义建设已进入一个新的阶段，国家的面貌在起着迅速的变化
    我们七人都在社会主义学院学习。在会议之前，全国政协和学院的领导，为了巩固和提高我们对党的八届八中全会文件学习的收获，帮助我们进一步进行政治思想上的自我改造，组织了我们学员到东北参观。这次参观历时二十天，到了东北三省七市，参观访问了三十多个单位，重点是重工业的厂矿企业，也参观了少数的轻工业、商业单位和个别的城市人民公社。这次参观使我们受到了一次极为深刻的生动的三大万岁的现实教育、社会主义的现实教育。东北三省同全国各地一样，在党的领导下，正在轰轰烈烈地开展着一个波澜壮阔、声势浩大带有全民性的以半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。从辽宁到黑龙江，从黑龙江到吉林，从拥有数万职工的重工业厂矿到只有三、四个职工的粮油商店，从研究设计机构到街道办的托儿所、幼儿园、服务站，从技术工人到刚走上生产工作岗位的家庭妇女，不论在那一个角落，不论男女老少，我们看到的是“个个出计，事事革新，个个献宝，天天创造”这样意气风发、斗志昂扬的豪迈气概和捷报频传，喜气洋洋的欢乐景象。新的事迹，新的人物是成千上万的涌现出来。成千上万的技术革新和技术革命的合理化建议，成千上万的机械化和自动化项目的实现，成千上万的革新能手和英雄，不仅是在迅速地改变着我们所参观的这些企业单位的生产技术面貌，而且使这些企业单位在生产上争得了六十年代第一年的春天的开门红、月月红、满堂红的大好形势。真是一片“思想红、革新红、生产红”的大好局面。这一切使我们深深地感受到我们的国家正处在万众一心、万马奔腾、万紫千红、万象更新的伟大时光里，真是感到“形势无限好，江山一片红。”
    这样的深刻感受给了我们很大的鼓舞，同时也对我们的思想引起了很大的影响。
    我们在社会主义学院里对党的八中全会文件的学习是有一定收获的。但是当我们去东北参观的时候，思想上还是存在着不少问题的。通过学习，虽然扫除了我们对1958年、1959年两年连续大跃进的怀疑，也认识到了党的总路线的完全正确，但是在我们思想深处不同程度的对能否持续大跃进还存在着疑问。有的认为1958年、1959年大跃进是事实，成就是巨大的，但它们的取得总觉得是硬干干出来的，则又如何能够一年又一年的持久下去？有的认为底子小，可以翻，经过了两年大跃进，底子大了，跃进就难了；有的认为设备落后的厂可以经过改造，发掘潜力，现代化的工厂已经高度机械化自动化了，是否还有多大的潜力可挖。这一系列的想法实质上反映在我们的思想上对持续大跃进存在着不同程度的怀疑。
    通过这次参观才认识到了这些想法都是错误的。
    在这次参观中，我们首先感受到的是：工人群众的革命干劲和首创精神、敢想敢做的共产主义风格。我们看到他们是意气风发、斗志昂扬、满面春风、喜气洋洋。他们是把这次技术革新和技术革命运动作为他们在政治上、经济上翻身之后的第二次解放。他们经过苦干实干巧干把自己从千百年来压在劳动人民身上的笨重体力劳动中解放出来，使自己真正成为机器的主人、世界的主人。从抚顺煤矿到大连港口，从沈阳重型机器厂到哈尔滨的饭店，看到他们是放下了铁锹，甩掉了垫肩，扔下了大锤，丢掉了菜刀。搬运工人歌唱着：“过去搬运用双肩，汗流满面腰腿酸，如今实行连续线，工人个个笑开颜”。磨碎工人歌唱着：“过去三圈半，累得一身汗，如今按电钮，人坐机器转”，饭店里的职工也歌唱着：“送菜不用走，切菜不用手，和面不用揉，一切按电钮”。从他们的诗歌里可以看出他们的高兴愉快的心情。我们看到他们今天所得到的幸福不是凭空而来的，而是他们艰苦奋斗辛勤劳动的果实。沈阳标准件厂就有一千多名工人为了保证实现今年生产翻番的光荣任务，大闹机械化、自动化，在春节时候，放弃了回家过节，把原先买好的火车票都退了。他们在春节假期中就搞出了四条自动线，三十九台单机自动化。这一巨大的战果奠定了该厂在“五一”节前实现全厂自动化的基础，保证了今年在不增人的情况下，使全厂生产在1958年、1959年连续大跃进的基础上再翻一番的大跃进。如做螺丝帽原来要经过十台旧机床的工序，经过改造，只要三台机床，加以连续化，成了完全自动化，原来需要十三人操作的，现在只需三人而产量增加一倍。该厂的工人在搞出了自动线之后说：“这样的春节才真正有意义，真是一个愉快的春节”。我们看到他们之所以这样“白天搞生产，晚上抓改造（技术改造）”，这样的废寝忘食，夜以继日的忘我劳动，正同工人自己所说的，是为了长远的幸福，“百日辛苦万年甜”，“一日辛苦，万年幸福”，这真是反映了他们迫切要求摆脱我国“一穷二白”的状态，尽快地把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家的强烈愿望，也是工人群众当家作主，主人翁思想的充分表现。使我们认识到过去两年的大跃进和今年以及今后的连续大跃进，正是工人群众和广大劳动人民在党的领导下鼓足干劲，力争上游的结果；是工人阶级为了实现他们建设社会主义、共产主义，解放全人类，解放自己的崇高理想的结果；是他们在党的总路线的照耀下，在毛泽东思想的指导下，解放了思想，打破了迷信，树雄心立大志树立了敢想敢做的共产主义风格的结果。思想解放，革新技术，生产翻番，进一步解放思想，把技术革新又推进一步，生产又得到了进一步的飞跃。鞍钢的工人说得好：“干字当头，一日千里，巧字当头，一跃再跃。”
    在参观中，我们所到的城市，所到的工厂都是无例外的在1958年、1959年取得了连续大跃进，因而从底子来说，确是成倍地扩大了。以哈尔滨电机厂来说，它们的产值以1957年作为100％，1958年是300％，1959年是500％，而今年的指标仍然是要比1959年翻一番，也就是说，是1957年的1000％。它们还不仅在生产产值上翻番，从大连机车厂的机车生产量来看，以1957年的产量作为100％，1958年是185％，1959年是243％，1960年是412％。该厂也同哈尔滨电机厂一样，在生产翻番的同时，制造新的高大精尖的产品。
    它们这些伟大的连续大跃进的指标和在第一季度已经取得的巨大成绩教育了我们：底子大了，基础也厚了，为今后的持续大跃进，不是带来更多的困难，而是带来了更多的更有利的更有力的条件和物质力量。两年来的大跃进使它们掌握了丰富的经验，有了比过去更为雄厚的物质技术基础，而更重要的是由于前二年来大跃进的胜利，工人群众在改造客观世界的斗争中改造了自己的主观世界，改变了自己的思想精神面貌；他们的革命干劲、敢想敢做的共产主义风格在连续大跃进的胜利中更加发扬光大。长春第一汽车制造厂工人所得的结论“越想越敢干，越干越敢想，越想越敢想，越干越敢干，越想越高，越干越大”有力地澄清了我们的错误想法。
    在参观中我们不仅看到了像沈阳标准件厂，从一个基本上是手工操作的、设备落后陈旧的工厂，在1958年用了蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，改造了陈旧的设备，在1959年制造了一百多台土洋机器，使该厂在今年“五一”节前成为一个完全自动化的工厂这样的奇迹，而且还看到了像长春第一汽车制造厂，这样现代化的新工厂，同样的通过大改大革向全面改变企业生产技术面貌进军以来，已经实现了一厂变四厂，而现在正在向一厂变五厂的宏伟目标前进。的确，长春第一汽车制造厂的设备是现代化的，但是从我们参观中看到在机械化自动化方面，还是大有可为的。不仅如此，而且在操作技术，产品设计，工艺路线，生产组织等各个方面的革新革命更是永无止境。这一切都使我们认识到了，所谓现代化，也是相对的。万样事物都不是静止的而是发展的。今天现代化的，还是需要不断地提高，不断的改进。技术革新无止境，生产潜力无穷尽。这才是符合事物不断发展变化的规律。
    总之，通过这次参观，有力地澄清了我们对怀疑是否能持续大跃进的各种形形式式错误思想，同时使我们更清楚地认识到我国社会主义建设已进入一个新的阶段，我们国家的面貌在起着迅速的变化。
    我们深深地感受到这次以机械化自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的来势之猛，发展之快，规模之大，效果之高。这个运动，在东北开展到现在还只几个月的时间，个别城市还是在今年春节之后才正式开展起来，可是，辽宁省到2月中旬，已有90％的职工投入了这个运动，提出了合理化建议一百二十五万件，已经实现的收到效果的达三十万件。其余的九十万件也在积极试验中。哈尔滨市提出了要在今年实现“百、千、万”（一百个自动化车间，一千条自动线，一万个单机自动化）。到2月止已完成生产自动线一百九十五条，单机自动化五百二十台，改装皮带机床一千多台，手工操作机械化项目四千多项。这些成千上万的合理化建议的实现，大大的提高了劳动生产率，节省了原材料、设备和投资，改善了劳动条件，从而对完成和超额完成国家指标起到了保证作用。
    我们看到这个运动不仅在工业开花结果，而是遍及到了基本建设、交通运输、机关学校、科学研究设计机构、商店、旅馆、食堂、银行、街道人民公社各个方面。沈阳铝镁设计院的员工在党的领导下，通过三结合创造了设计计算工作电气化的设备。他们制成的新型计算台，只要一名普通设计员按电钮操纵，两小时就可以完成过去高级设计员用两个星期才能完成的工作量。他们在今年的2月15日，提前十个半月的时间，完成了1960年全年的设计任务。哈尔滨的三八饭店是一家在一年多前由十名家庭妇女搞起来的一个食堂发展起来的饭店，通过大闹技术革新、技术革命，创造了切菜机，包饺子自动线，空中传菜机，大大的提高了工作效率，减轻了体力劳动，职工感到心情舒畅，顾客感到称心满意。长春汽车厂一个普通工人创造了用无线电控制天车的运行。我们在大连看到了年产几十万吨的化肥厂在大闹技术革命、生产翻番，同时还看到了大连化工厂的职工克服了艰巨的技术关，而创造出来的世界上从未有过的年产八百吨的小型合成氨厂，也同样的在支援农业生产方面发出了巨大的威力。
    我们看到的一切，使我们感受到这个伟大的运动已经形成了一个全民性的运动。这个运动不仅是一般操作上的革新，而是工艺上的革命，材料上的革命，产品上的革命，不仅是生产上的革命运动而且是思想上的革命运动。虽然还仅是开端，但已经在迅速地改变着所有厂矿企业、事业单位的生产技术面貌，同时也在迅速地改变着所有人们的思想精神面貌。这些迅速的变化，也就带来了我们整个国家面貌的迅速变化。
    “我”字当头，半心半意是我们必须改掉的东西，工人群众的“公”字当头，一心一意是我们学习的榜样。“我”字当头，必然是一事无成，政治挂帅，必然是前途光明
    这些深刻的感受使我们进一步体会到党的领导就是真理，使我们进一步认识到毛泽东思想掌握了，千百万群众产生巨大无比、无往不胜的物质力量。这是我国社会主义建设持续跃进的根本保证。社会主义建设中的巨大成就，是党的领导与大搞群众运动的伟大胜利；是总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针的伟大胜利；是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们同全国人民一样，完全相信在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，1960年的国民经济计划一定能够完成和超额完成，我国的社会主义建设一定能够持续的全面的大跃进。
    通过这次参观，使我们进一步的看清了自己与工人群众的差别，进一步明确了自我改造的具体内容。我们看到工人群众对党的领导的态度是党指向那里，就奔向那里，“只要党安上梯子，我们就上天摘下月亮来”；他们是干劲冲天，意气风发，在他们面前是没有克服不了的困难，他们说：“愚公移山嫌太慢，要学二郎把山担”，“三不要（不向国家要资金、要设备、要材料），生产要翻番”；没有材料自己找，没有设备自己造；他们从不满足于已取得的成绩，始终是充满了不断革命的精神，他们说：“劲添劲，巧加巧，闹革新，争分秒”；他们是舍己为人，助人为乐，不计报酬，不讲条件，把困难留给自己，把方便让与别人，他们是充满着互助协作的共产主义风格。联系到我们自己，在不同程度上存在着怀疑顾虑，摇摆不定，干劲不足；既想干，又怕干；怕困难，怕紧张，怕一无技术；稍有进步，稍有成绩，就认为“差不多了”，可以“歇一歇”。总起来说，我们是“我”字当头，半心半意；工人群众则是“公”字当头，一心一意。因而，使我们更清楚地认识到，“我”字当头、半心半意是我们必须改掉的东西；工人群众的“公”字当头、一心一意是我们学习的榜样。“我”字当头，必然是一事无成，政治挂帅，必然是前途光明。
    李富春副总理和李先念副总理的振奋人心的报告，给了我们很大的鼓舞力量。我们决心在学习期间，认真贯彻党的教育方针，认真学习毛泽东思想，联系思想，联系实际，努力改造我们的资产阶级立场和世界观，在学习结业以后，我们回到各自的工作岗位上，积极投入到以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中去，为社会主义事业，贡献我们的一切力量。
