Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: Harbin has achieved cooperative power supply city-wide. More than 185,000 scattered electricity-using units in the city have formed a city-wide power grid for unified cooperative power supply.

From the emergence of the "Four-in-One" ring power supply experience to the realization of city-wide cooperative power supply, Harbin has dismantled 581 transformers from the old, unreasonable power distribution system, totaling 34,800 kVA, as well as over 200,770 meters of various electric wires and cables, and over 640 electric poles, providing a large amount of equipment for the establishment of new industrial zones and rural power grids. At the same time, due to the rationalization of power supply, the power supply capacity of many transformer equipment has been fully utilized, thus tapping over 51,000 kW of electricity, essentially eliminating households lacking electricity. Currently, Harbin has used the dismantled electrical equipment to erect a 60-kilometer-long transmission line, transmitting power to the suburbs, supporting electricity for suburban production and lighting.

Due to the realization of urban cooperative power supply, all 35 transformer substation and transmission station construction projects originally planned to be newly built or expanded by the city this year have been canceled, saving the state a total investment of more than 2.1 million yuan.

Harbin's rapid realization of cooperative power supply is the result of mass collaboration. After the "Four-in-One" ring power supply experience emerged in the Nanma Road area of Harbin last winter, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened an on-site meeting to summarize and promote this experience. A mass movement to promote the "Four-in-One" ring power supply experience quickly unfolded throughout the city's power supply system. The Xiangfang People's Commune organized a large army of over 500 people for the electrical technology revolution. Under the leadership of the Commune Party Secretary, they worked day and night, and it took only three days to realize the cooperative power supply of the entire commune.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The Shanghai Power Supply Company, based on summarizing its original ring power supply experience, has further developed a new automated power supply method that integrates power supply and usage over a larger area. This power supply method has been formally adopted in the Jing'an District of Shanghai, covering an area of 6.24 million square meters, since March 25th. It includes a larger area and greater capacity of power equipment than the ring power grids generally used in China today. Practical power supply over the past ten days has proven that using this method of power supply has tapped 10,000 kVA of potential from transformer equipment, and can save 2.5 million kWh of electricity consumed by these transformers each year, while also eliminating power outages.

Prior to this, Shanghai's power grid had undergone two transformations since liberation. In the early days of liberation, Shanghai's old power grid underwent preliminary improvements, eliminating the chaotic layout, outdated equipment, and fragmented state of the old power grid. In 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, in order to better meet the rapidly growing electricity demand and tap the potential of power supply equipment, most of the adjacent low-voltage power grids in the city were connected to form small, combined ring power supplies. The current power supply method is a more advanced power supply method developed on the basis of this ring power supply. Its characteristics are "large and public," meaning that all 113 transformers and distribution lines in the Jing'an District, which has more than 1,600 factories and enterprises and more than 25,000 institutions, schools, and residents, are connected, so that they can share resources and support each other on a larger scale, breaking the boundaries of individual household electricity use and maximizing the potential of power supply equipment. With this method of power supply, if a piece of equipment malfunctions, other equipment will automatically supply power immediately, and it can also improve the quality of power supply, stabilize voltage, and reduce power loss in the lines.

This large-scale integrated power supply new technology of the Shanghai Power Supply Company is one of the major achievements of the company's employees in vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. In the current surging wave of technical innovation and technical revolution in Shanghai, the degree of mechanization and automation in all aspects is getting higher and higher, and the requirements for the power industry are also getting higher and higher. In order to more safely and economically meet the electricity needs of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the company's employees are determined to create a higher-level and more reasonable power supply method. During the reform process, the employees were full of energy and high morale. Due to the large area, large workload, and insufficient labor, relevant units fully promoted the communist spirit and actively supported. For example, the Hu'nan, Hu'bei, and Pudong Power Supply Stations organized forces to come to support. After only eight days, the distribution system of this power supply area completed a revolution.

Now the Shanghai Power Supply Company is simultaneously summarizing and evaluating, and promoting and improving, and at the same time will also promote this new technology on the high-voltage power grid, so that this new power supply method can bear fruitful results throughout the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th: The advanced experience of urban cooperative power supply pioneered by Harbin has been rapidly promoted in Hubei Province.

After completing the work of promoting this experience in twenty-four pilot projects in the Wuhan area, 145 transformers with unreasonable settings, totaling 26,900 kVA, as well as a large number of wires, cables, high-voltage switches, and other electrical equipment and materials, have been dismantled. The Jinshandian Coal Mine in the Huangshi area canceled the construction of a substation due to the realization of cooperative power supply, saving an investment of 460,000 yuan. Units that have implemented cooperative power supply have generally received the effect of more power supply, less power loss, safety, and increased production.

The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of promoting this experience, regarding it as an important part of the current technical revolution movement. The Provincial Party Committee instructed party committees at all levels to conscientiously strengthen the leadership of this work. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee has taken this work as a major key to doing a good job in power supply. Under the personal leadership of Tang Ruipu, secretary of the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, a leading group for promoting urban cooperative power supply reform was specially established, so that the power supply reform work quickly unfolded throughout the city within two or three days. The Daye Iron Mine originally had surplus power, and the surrounding residents had requested power supply through relevant departments seven times in a row, but because the past power supply method was that "power and lighting electricity could not be combined, and factory and outside electricity could not be combined," it had not been resolved. Now, the Daye Iron Mine completed the cooperative power supply reform on the first day, and sent out electricity on the second day, making the surrounding residential houses shine brightly.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th: More than 50 units in Lanzhou have promoted Harbin's "Four-in-One" ring power supply experience.

After more than 50 units in Lanzhou promoted the "Four-in-One" ring power supply, a total of 41 transformers were dismantled, with a capacity of 5,715 kVA, more than 63,000 meters of various wires, 2,900 meters of high and low voltage cables, and many electric poles, high and low voltage switchgear cabinets, insulating magnetic bottles, lightning arresters and other equipment and materials. The electrical equipment and materials dismantled by the Lanzhou Chemical Plant alone can equip six small fertilizer plants with an annual output of 2,000 tons. After implementing ring power supply, units such as the Donggang Steel Plant have increased their external power supply capacity while dismantling some transformer equipment, enabling some nearby units lacking electricity to obtain urgently needed power. Due to the promotion of the ring power supply experience and the simplification of equipment, four units including the Donggang Steel Plant can reduce the electricity consumed by transformers and the electricity lost in lines by more than 28,000 kWh per year.

    哈尔滨实现全市供用电合作化  上海推行大规模的综合供电方式
    湖北、兰州广泛推广环形供电的先进经验
    据新华社哈尔滨16日电　哈尔滨市已实现供用电合作化。全市十八万五千多个分散用电单位已组成了一个全市性供电网，统一进行合作供电。
    自出现“四合一”环形供电经验到全市实现供用电合作化，哈尔滨市已从旧的不合理的配电系统上拆卸下来五百八十一台变压器，共三万四千八百千伏安，各种电线、电缆二十万零七千七百多米，电柱六百四十多根，为建立新兴工业区和农村的电力网提供了大量设备。同时，由于供电合理了，许多变电设备的供电能力得到了充分地发挥，因此还挖掘出了五万一千多瓩电力，从而基本上消灭了缺电户。现在，哈尔滨市用拆下来的电气设备已经架设起一条长达六十公里的输电线路，把电源输送到郊区，支援了郊区生产用电和照明用电。
    由于实现城市供用电合作化，全市原来有三十五个单位计划在今年新建或扩建的变电所和输电站工程项目已全部取消，总计可为国家节约投资二百一十多万元。
   哈尔滨市迅速实现供用电合作化，是全民大协作的结果。去年冬天哈尔滨南马路地区出现了“四合一”环形供电经验以后，中共哈尔滨市委立即召开现场会议，总结和推广了这一经验，全市供电系统很快地开展推广“四合一”环形供电经验的群众运动。香坊人民公社组织了五百多人的电力技术革命大军，在公社党委书记领导下昼夜奋战，仅用三天时间就实现了全社供用电合作化。
    新华社上海16日电　上海供电公司在总结原来的环形供电经验的基础上，进一步发展为一种更大面积的、供用电合一的新的自动化供电方式。这种供电方式，从3月25日起在上海市静安区六百二十四万平方米的面积上已正式采用。它比我国目前一般采用环形供电的电网所包括的地区和供电设备的容量更大。经过十多天来实际供电证明，用这种方式供电，挖出了变电设备潜力一万千伏安，而且每年可节省这些变压器消耗的电力二百五十万度，同时也消灭了停电事故。
    在此以前，上海的电力网从解放以来，已经过两次变革。还在解放初期，上海的旧电力网就进行了初步改进，消除了旧电力网布局混乱、设备陈旧和分割状态。1958年，在工农业生产大跃进的形势下，为了更好地满足迅速增长的用电需要，挖掘供电设备的潜力，又把全市大部分相邻的低压电力网联结起来，成为小型的组合式的环形供电。现在这种供电方式，就是在这种环形供电的基础上发展成的更高级的供电方式。它的特点是“一大二公”，即把这个具有一千六百多家工厂企业和二万五千多家机关、学校、居民等的静安区内所有一百一十三台变压器和配电线路全部联接起来，这样就可以在更大的范围内互通有无，相互支援，打破了一家一户用电的界限，发挥了供电设备的最大的潜力。用这种方式供电，如果某项设备有故障，立即会自动由其他设备供电，而且还能提高供电质量，稳定电压和减少电能在线路上的损耗。
    上海供电公司这种大规模综合供电新技术，是这个公司的职工大闹技术革新和技术革命的重大成果之一。在上海当前技术革新和技术革命的汹涌浪潮中，各方面机械化、自动化的程度越来越高，对电业的要求也愈来愈高。为了更安全、更经济地满足工农业生产继续跃进的用电，这个公司职工决心创造更高级、更合理的供电方式。在改革过程中，职工们干劲冲天，斗志昂扬。由于面积大，工作量大，劳动力不够，有关单位充分发扬共产主义风格，积极支援。如沪南、沪北、浦东供电所等，都组织力量前来支援。经过短短的八天时间，这个供电区的配电系统就完成了一次革命。
    现在上海供电公司正一手抓总结评比，一手抓推广提高，同时在高压电网上也将推行这一新技术，使这一新的供电方式，在全市结出丰硕之果。
    据新华社武汉16日电　哈尔滨市首创的城市合作化供电的先进经验，已在湖北省迅速推广。
    武汉地区在二十四个试点完成推广这一经验的工作后，已拆下设置不合理的变压器一百四十五台共二万六千九百千伏安，还有大量的电线、电缆、高压开关等各种电气器材。黄石地区金山店煤矿，因实现合作化供电，取消了变电站的建设，节约投资四十六万元。已推行合作化供电的单位，都普遍收到了多供电，少损电，既安全，又增产的效果。
    中共湖北省委和各级党委十分重视推广这个经验的工作，把它作为当前技术革命运动中的一个重要部分。省委指示各级党委，要认真加强这一工作的领导。武汉市委已把这工作作为搞好电力供应的重大关键之一来抓。黄石市在市委书记处书记汤瑞普亲自领导下，专门成立了推广城市合作化供电改革领导小组，使供电改革工作二、三天内迅速在全市展开。大冶铁矿原来的电力有余，周围居民曾连续七次通过有关部门要求供电，但因为过去的供电方式是“动力、照明用电不能合一，厂内厂外用电不能合一”，一直不能解决。现在大冶铁矿第一天完成合作化供电改革，第二天就把电送出来，使周围居民住宅大放光明。
    新华社兰州16日电　兰州市有五十多个单位推广了哈尔滨市“四合一”环形供电的经验。
    兰州市五十多个单位推广“四合一”环形供电以后，共拆下了变压器四十一台，容量五千七百一十五千伏安，各种导线六万三千多米，高低压电缆二千九百米，以及许多电柱、高低压开关柜、绝缘磁瓶、避雷器等设备和器材。仅兰州化工厂拆下的电气设备和材料，就可装备六个年产二千吨小型肥料厂的输电装置。东岗钢厂等单位实行环形供电后，在拆除部分变电设备的情况下，还增加了对外供电能力，使附近一些缺电单位得到了急需的电力。由于推广环形供电经验，简化了设备，东岗钢厂等四个单位，一年内就可减少变压器消耗的电力和线路损失的电力共二万八千余度。
