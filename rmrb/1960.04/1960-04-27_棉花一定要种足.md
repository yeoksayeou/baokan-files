From the cotton planting situation in various regions, the cotton planting area in many regions is basically arranged according to the national plan, and the planting preparation work has been done more thoroughly than in any previous year, and the planting quality is also better than in any previous year. This is a good start to this year's cotton bumper harvest campaign, and it is also the mainstream of this campaign. However, judging from the comparison between the cotton planting plan and the actual planting area in previous years, and the comparison between the planting area and the harvested area, and from the specific situation of cotton planting in some areas, we are not allowed to relax our attention to cotton planting work in the midst of a good situation. The better the situation, the better we must do our work; a "good beginning" must also have a "good ending." We must maintain full enthusiasm from beginning to end, without slackening for a minute; the acreage of cotton must be planted fully according to plan, without falling short by even a fraction of a field!

The cotton planting situation in Fugou County, Henan Province, this year is of typical significance. This county is a well-known county that has rapidly transformed from a low-yield cotton area to a high-yield cotton area. In 1957, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was only twenty-four jin; in 1959, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was one hundred and seventeen jin. Relying on the strength of the people's communes, large-scale and large-area operation of cotton fields increased the unit yield by nearly four times in two years. This year, according to the national plan, the cotton field area in this county will be expanded from 130,000 mu to more than 150,000 mu. From cadres at all levels to commune members, they are determined and confident in completing the glorious task of cotton planting; this year's cotton planting work is indeed earlier, faster, and of better quality than in previous years. After they had made preparations, they did a trial planting in one day, and a concentrated effort in three days, and the county's planting task was basically completed. The most valuable spirit lies in this: the comrades in Fugou County did not stop the cotton planting work at this point; they did not simply declare the victorious end of the cotton planting work, but mobilized the masses to first conduct a major inspection, and then start a new battle, pushing the cotton planting work to a higher and fuller level. On April 5, the cotton planting was "basically completed," and on April 6, more than two hundred inspection and acceptance teams with more than one thousand people were formed to go deep into the fields to conduct a comprehensive and meticulous inspection of the area and quality. How strict they are in demanding themselves! The inspection results revealed problems: a total of 5,956 mu of cotton planting plan had not been completed in the county; more than 1,300 mu had not been planted to the edges of the fields, and some seeds were not tightly covered; the canals in 5,500 mu of cotton fields were not up to standard. In previous years, these problems were either not discovered without inspection, or were taken for granted and not taken seriously; this year, they demanded themselves with higher standards and regarded these as very important problems.

Problems have been discovered, how to solve them? Make a calculation, redistribute the shortfall to each production team, and set a time limit to make up for the planting, right? The Fugou County Party Committee did not simply adopt this method. They still first held high the banner of political leadership, fully mobilized the masses, and continued to carry out mass movements on a large scale. They closely combined political work with economic work, and launched planting cotton as a socialist and communist political and ideological movement. In the radio rallies attended by more than 200,000 people, in the large report meetings in the public canteens, in the field meetings, and in the roadside forums, the socialist and communist voices and the high tide of cotton planting were completely merged. The vast number of cadres and commune members more clearly understood that the national socialist economy is an inseparable game of chess; the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations in an all-round way cannot be cut off to only focus on grain and not on cotton; industry and agriculture must be interdependent and mutually supportive; to make economic construction develop at a high speed, it must be developed in a planned and proportional way. In this way, people regard planting cotton adequately as an extremely important component of completing the annual socialist construction plan in an all-round way, and as an extremely important source of developing the collective economy of the people's communes, improving the living standards of the people across the country, and increasing the income of commune members. The vast number of masses further grasped the law of socialist economic development, which made the completion of the cotton planting plan by 100% a more conscious and active action. In such practical actions, the ideological level of the vast number of masses has also been rapidly improved a step further. Enthusiasm has been full all along, and the planting plan has also been completed in full; the territory of communist ideology has been expanded, and the completion of the planting area according to plan has the most reliable guarantee. Fugou originally found that it was short of more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields; as a result of mobilizing the masses to replant, another 8,000 mu were planted. At the same time, replanting, covering, and repairing were carried out for cotton fields that were not planted to the edges, planted to the ends, and the seeds were not tightly covered, and the field canals that were not up to the standards of garden cultivation. So, did this squeeze out some grain fields? No. Because they tried every means to make full use of the land and rationally organized the labor force, the grain planting area also overfulfilled the national plan. With socialism and communism in command, problems such as "insufficient arable land" and "insufficient labor force" were all easily solved. Whether it is ideological superstition or practical difficulties, they cannot be broken under the light of socialism and communism.

Just do it like Fugou! Wherever there is a cotton planting task, every county and every commune should conduct a major inspection and a major mobilization, fully muster the enthusiasm by 100% in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, and plant cotton by 100% in accordance with the requirements of the national plan!

### 棉花一定要种足

    棉花一定要种足
    从各地的棉花播种情况来看，很多地区的棉花播种面积，基本上都是按照国家计划安排的，播种准备工作比以往任何一年都做得更加周到，播种质量也比以往任何一年都好。这是今年棉花丰产运动的良好的开端，也是这个运动的主流。可是，从历年棉花的播种计划和实播面积的对比、播种面积和收获面积的对比来看，从当前一些地区棉花播种的具体情况来看，都不允许我们在大好形势之中放松对棉花播种工作的注意。越是形势好，越要把工作做得更好，“善始”还须“善终”。干劲要自始至终鼓得足足的，一分钟也不松懈；棉花的亩数要按计划种得足足的，一分地也不短少！
    河南扶沟县今年的棉花播种情况是有典型意义的。这个县是个有名的由棉花低产区高速度地变成棉花高产区的县份。1957年，平均亩产皮棉只有二十四斤；1959年，平均亩产皮棉一百一十七斤。依靠人民公社的力量，大规模地大面积地经营棉田，单位产量两年间增长了将近四倍。今年，按照国家计划，这个县的棉田面积要由十三万亩扩大到十五万多亩。从各级干部到公社社员，对完成植棉的光荣任务是有决心有信心的；今年的棉花播种工作也的确比往年动手更早，进度更快，质量更好。他们做好准备之后，一天试播，三天突击，全县的播种任务就基本完成了。最可贵的精神在于：扶沟县的同志们没有把棉花播种工作停止在这个地方；他们不是就此宣告棉花播种工作胜利结束，而是动员群众先来一次大检查，再来一次新战斗，把棉花播种工作推向更足更高的水平。4月5日棉花播种“基本完成”，4月6日就组成一千多人参加的二百多个检查验收组，深入田间，普遍地细致地查面积、查质量。他们是多么严格地要求自己！检查结果，发现了问题：全县总共还差五千九百五十六亩没有完成棉花播种计划；有一千三百多亩没有种到地头地边，还有一些种子复盖不严；有五千五百亩棉田的渠道还不够标准。在往年，这些问题，不是未经检查没有发现，便是习以为常不以为意；今年，他们用更高的标准要求自己，把这些看成了十分重要的问题。
    问题发现了，怎么解决？打打算盘，把不足之数再分配给各个生产队，限期补足种好，就行了吧？扶沟县委不是简单地采取这样的办法。他们还是首先高举政治帅旗，充分发动群众，继续大搞群众运动。他们把政治工作和经济工作紧密地结合起来，把种足棉花作为一次社会主义和共产主义的政治思想运动开展起来。在二十多万人参加的广播大会上，在公共食堂里的大报告会上，在田间会议上，在地头座谈会上，社会主义、共产主义的声浪和种棉花的高潮完全汇合在一起。广大干部和公社社员更清楚地理解了：全国的社会主义经济是不能分开的一盘棋；以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针不能截开来只重视粮食，不重视棉花；工业和农业必须互相依存、互相支援；要使经济建设高速度发展就必须有计划按比例发展。这样，人们就把十足地种好棉花看成了全面地完成全年的社会主义建设计划的极其重要的一个组成部分，看成了发展人民公社集体经济、提高全国人民生活水平和增加公社社员收入的一个极其重要的泉源。广大群众进一步掌握了社会主义经济发展的规律，就使百分之百地完成种棉计划成为更自觉更积极的行动。在这样的实际行动中，广大群众的思想水平也更迅速地提高一步。干劲一直十足，播种计划也就完成得十足；共产主义思想的地盘扩大了，按计划完成播种面积就有了最可靠的保证。扶沟原来检查发现还缺五千多亩棉田；发动群众补种的结果，又种了八千多亩。同时，对于没有种到边、种到头和种子盖土不严的棉田，不够园田化标准的田间渠道，都进行了补种、复盖、整修。这样，是不是又挤掉了一些粮田呢？没有。由于他们千方百计充分利用了土地，合理组织了劳力，粮食播种面积也超额完成了国家计划。社会主义和共产主义思想挂了帅，“耕地支配不过来”、“劳力支配不过来”等等问题，就都迎刃而解。不论是思想上的迷信还是实际上的困难，在社会主义和共产主义的光芒照耀下，没有攻不破的。
    就照着扶沟这样干吧！凡是有种棉任务的地方，每个县，每个公社，都来一次大检查、大发动，按照不断革命的精神把干劲百分之百地鼓足，按照国家计划的要求把棉花百分之百地种足！
