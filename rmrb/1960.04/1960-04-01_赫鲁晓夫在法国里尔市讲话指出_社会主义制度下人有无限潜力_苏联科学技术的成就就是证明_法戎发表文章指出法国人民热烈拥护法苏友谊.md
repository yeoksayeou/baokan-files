Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch: According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage departed from Lille, the largest industrial center in northern France, on the morning of the 30th to visit the industrial cities of Wattrelos and Marcq-en-Barœul. In the afternoon, they returned to Lille to attend a welcome reception held by the Lille Municipal Council. Khrushchev delivered a speech at the reception.

Khrushchev spoke about the friendship between the Soviet Union and France, saying: We have come to France not only for talks but also to learn about the life of the wise and hard-working French people in all its aspects. During our short visit to France, we have seen many interesting things that are very beneficial to the development of friendly relations between our two countries.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people are now engaged in peaceful labor. The Soviet economy and culture are developing rapidly. Our seven-year plan is being successfully implemented. We are striving to develop our economy and are primarily concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the Soviet people and creating the best possible conditions for the all-round development of human personality. One-third of our national budget is spent on education, science, culture, health, and social security.

The development of Soviet science and industry has made it possible to launch artificial earth satellites, solar satellites, and take pictures of the far side of the moon. We see the achievements of Soviet scientists and technicians as proof of the unlimited potential of people under the socialist system and believe that these achievements should be used for the benefit of all mankind.

Khrushchev said that everyone understands that lasting peace is necessary for the smooth development of the economy, science, culture, and the improvement of people's living standards. The Soviet people want to live in peace with the people of all countries. If the Soviet Union and France unite, they can do much to strengthen the cause of peace and the security of all nations.

Khrushchev continued, saying that the Soviet people are focusing their energy on developing their country and economy, and they do not want anyone to hinder them. Our people love their country and their socialist system. If anyone tries to disrupt our peaceful life and infringe upon our system, the Soviet people will fight even more bravely than they did against the Hitler fascist bandits. We meet with all those who wish to meet with us with the aim of preventing war, to seek a common language and mutual understanding conducive to ensuring peace.

After the reception, Khrushchev and his entourage left Lille by special train for Rouen.

On the same afternoon, Khrushchev and his entourage arrived in Rouen and attended a welcome reception held at the Rouen Chamber of Commerce. On the morning of the 31st, Khrushchev and his entourage left Rouen for Flins, where they visited the "Renault" car factory. Khrushchev accepted a "Floride" sports car as a gift. In the afternoon, Khrushchev and his entourage left Flins and returned to Paris.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 30th: "L'Humanité" published today an article by Fargeonne, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, on the first week of Khrushchev's visit to France.

Fargeonne said that Khrushchev has been given grand, moving, and warm welcomes by the masses of people throughout France. The vast majority of the French people have expressed their support for French-Soviet friendship with extraordinary force, advocating international détente and hoping for peace.

Fargeonne said that millions of French people who previously only understood Soviet policy through anti-Soviet distortions are now recognizing this policy.

Fargeonne wrote that Khrushchev explained during his visit that the Soviet Union is building communism, and the facts prove the superiority of the Soviet system. He believes, as we do, that all nations will embark on the road to communism when the time comes, but the future of each country is a matter for the people of that country themselves.

Fargeonne pointed out that millions of French people of different political and religious beliefs and different social strata welcomed Khrushchev's message, advocating that countries should establish friendly and cooperative relations despite their different political and social systems. Khrushchev reminded people to be vigilant against the resurgence of German militarism and repeatedly reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

Fargeonne expressed his belief that the confident and joyful unity displayed by the people in the French towns and villages through which Khrushchev passed will be embodied in persistent action, thereby removing the obstacles that stand in the way of peace.

    赫鲁晓夫在法国里尔市讲话指出
    社会主义制度下人有无限潜力  苏联科学技术的成就就是证明
    法戎发表文章指出法国人民热烈拥护法苏友谊
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员30日上午从法国北部最大的工业中心里尔市出发访问了瓦特雷洛和马克安巴雷耳这两个工业城市，中午又回到里尔市出席了里尔市政委员会的欢迎会。赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联和法国的友谊，他说：我们来法国不仅是为了会谈，而且是为了了解智慧的勤劳的法国人民各方面的生活。在我们访问法国的短短期间里，我们看到许多有趣的、对发展我们两国之间的友好关系十分有利的东西。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在苏联人民正从事和平劳动。苏联的经济和文化正在迅速发展。我们的七年计划正在顺利地实现。我们竭力发展我们的经济，我们首先关心最大限度地满足苏联人民的物质和文化需要，关心创造一切最好的条件来全面发展人的个性。我们国家三分之一的预算用在教育、科学、文化、卫生和社会保障上。
    苏联科学和工业的发展使发射人造地球、太阳卫星以及拍摄月球不可见的一面的照片成为可能。我们把苏联科学家和技术人员的成就看成是社会主义制度下人的无限潜力的明证，并且认为，应该把这些成就用来为全人类谋福利。
    赫鲁晓夫说，每个人都清楚，要顺利地发展经济、科学、文化以及提高人民的生活水平必须有持久和平。苏联人希望和各国人民一道过和平生活。如果苏联和法国团结起来，就能为加强和平和各国人民安全事业作出许多事情。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏联人民把自己的精力放在发展自己的国家和经济上，他们不希望任何人来妨碍他们。我们的人民热爱自己的国家，热爱自己的社会主义制度。如果谁想破坏我们的和平生活，侵犯我们的制度，苏联人民就会比对付希特勒法西斯匪徒时更英勇地投入战斗。我们抱着防止战争的目的同所有希望与我们会晤的人会晤，以寻求有利于保障和平的共同语言和相互谅解。
    在招待会后，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员乘专车离里尔去卢昂。
    当天下午，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员到达卢昂，并参加了在卢昂商会举行的欢迎会。31日上午，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员离开了卢昂前往弗兰，他们在弗兰参观了“雷诺”汽车工厂。赫鲁晓夫接受了赠送给他的一架“佛罗里达”牌的体育汽车。下午，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员离开弗兰回到巴黎。
    新华社巴黎30日电　“人道报”今天刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员法戎就赫鲁晓夫访问法国的第一周情况写的文章。
    法戎说，赫鲁晓夫在法国各地受到人民群众的盛大、动人和热烈的欢迎。法国人民的绝大多数异常有力地表示拥护法苏友谊，赞成国际缓和，希望和平。
    法戎说，本来只从反苏的歪曲宣传中了解苏联政策的数以百万计的法国人现在才认识了这个政策。
    法戎写道，赫鲁晓夫在访问中阐明苏联在建设共产主义，事实证明了苏联制度的优越性。他像我们一样认为，在时机到来时各国人民都将走上共产主义道路，但是每一个国家的前途是这个国家人民自己的事情。
    法戎指出，不同政治和宗教信仰、不同社会地位的千百万法国人都欢迎赫鲁晓夫的语言，他主张尽管政治和社会制度不同，各国应该建立友好和合作的关系。赫鲁晓夫提醒人们谨防德国军国主义的复活，并且一再重申苏联的全面彻底裁军建议。
    法戎表示相信，赫鲁晓夫路过的法国城乡的人民所表现的有信心的和愉快的团结，将体现为坚持不懈的行动，从而扫除横在和平的道路上的种种障碍。
