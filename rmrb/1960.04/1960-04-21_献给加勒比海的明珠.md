    Dedicated to the Pearl of the Caribbean
    Guo Moruo
    Cuba, the pearl of the Caribbean,
    A child of the 1960s,
    We, the Chinese people, care about you,
    All progressive people around the world care about you.
    Congratulations on your rebirth, our brother,
    You have raised a great banner first in Latin America.
    Your victory is our victory,
    Your cheers fly across the Pacific,
    Clearly and powerfully reaching my ears.
    But I also hear bursts of discordant sounds,
    Someone is bombing your sugarcane fields,
    With planes flying from imperialist America.
    American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all mankind,
    It is truly tyrannical and unreasonable.
    It is covered with military bases all over the world,
    Wantonly trampling on the sovereignty of others, regardless of East or West,
    Nazi remnants and remnants of the imperial way have become its companions,
    And yet it pretends to be a savior.
    It is said that Latin America is its "backyard,"
    And Cuba is even closer to its armpit,
    This threatens it, so it cannot ignore it.
    However, our Taiwan is more than five thousand nautical miles away from it,
    Why does it occupy it and not want to return it?
    Humph! This tiger's appetite is truly incomparably large!
    However, this tiger is just a paper tiger,
    We have learned from it many times.
    It has already been driven out of mainland China,
    And it was left battered and bruised in Korea.
    As long as we unite and resolutely resist,
    It will not be a problem to puncture this paper tiger!
    New Cuba, we fully support you,
    Our 650 million people fully support you,
    Although we are far in the East, and you are far in the West,
    But we have a common enemy and a common fighting spirit,
    We must not only defend the independence of our nation,
    But also fight to the end for the liberation of all mankind!
    Cuba, what I dedicate to you is just a poem,
    But our poems express the will of the masses,
    This will be transformed into material strength, transformed into airplanes,
    Transformed into intercontinental missiles, transformed into new weapons,
    To bury the robbers who bombed your sugarcane fields, American imperialism,
    In the grave it dug itself!
                  April 20, 1960, in Shanghai

### 献给加勒比海的明珠

    献给加勒比海的明珠
    郭沫若
    古巴，加勒比海的明珠，
    二十世纪六十年代的赤子，
    我们中国人民的心关切着你，
    全世界进步人类的心都关切着你。
    祝贺你得到了新生，我们的兄弟，
    在拉丁美洲首先树立了一面大旗。
    你们的胜利就是我们的胜利，
    你们的欢呼声飞越过太平洋，
    清晰地，雄壮地传到了我的耳里。
    但我也听到一阵阵破调的声音，
    那是有人在轰炸你们的蔗田，
    是从帝国主义的美国飞去的飞机。
    美帝国主义是全人类最凶恶的敌人，
    它真是横行霸道，丝毫不讲道理。
    它在全世界布满着军事基地，
    任意蹂躏别人的主权，不分东西，
    纳粹遗孽，皇道残余，都成了它的伴侣，
    而它却伪装着一个救世主的样儿。
    据说拉丁美洲是它的“后院”，
    而古巴更接近它的肘腋，
    这就威胁着它，使它不能不理。
    然而我们的台湾离开它五千多海里，
    为什么它也霸占着，不想回去？
    哼！这只老虎的口胃真是其大无比！
    然而这只老虎只是纸老虎，
    我们向它已经领教过多少次。
    从中国大陆上已经把它驱逐了，
    在朝鲜也使得它鳞伤遍体。
    只要我们团结起来，坚决反抗，
    要戳穿这只纸老虎，那不成问题！
    新生的古巴，我们完全支持你，
    我们六亿五千万人完全支持你，
    虽然我们远远在东，你们远远在西，
    但我们有共同的敌人，共同的斗志，
    我们不仅要维护本民族的独立，
    还要为全人类的解放奋斗到底！
    古巴，我献给你的虽然只是一首诗，
    但我们的诗是表达着群众的意志，
    这要化成为物质力量，化成为飞机，
    化成为洲际导弹，化成为新武器，
    把轰炸你们蔗田的强盗，美帝国主义，
    埋葬在它自己挖掘的坟坑里！
                  一九六○年四月二十日于上海
