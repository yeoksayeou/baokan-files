Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 17th: Guangxi is taking effective measures to consolidate the ten million mu of barren land newly reclaimed this year, and has launched a "Turn Barren Land into Ripe Land" nursing campaign, striving for overall high yields. Through the diligent efforts of the commune members, various crops on the newly reclaimed land are growing well. In some counties, the first and second class seedlings account for more than 80%. Early-planted climbing crops have lush vines and leaves covering the ground. In the Guinan area, early-planted corn is generally more than two feet tall, and some have already begun to form cobs.

The newly reclaimed barren land in Guangxi is generally of good quality and has been promptly planted with corn, tubers, beans, other coarse grains, and cash crops. However, newly reclaimed land is mainly mountainous, with generally steep slopes, making it prone to soil erosion; moreover, the land is thin and infertile, prone to weeds and pests. Thus, after sowing, continued repair and enhanced nursing are necessary. Therefore, while focusing on early rice planting, Party committees at all levels are leading commune members in highlighting the consolidation and nursing of newly reclaimed barren land to expand the results of land reclamation and planting.

An important link in consolidating newly reclaimed barren land is preventing soil erosion. To this end, drainage ditches or contour belts are dug on the mountainsides during reclamation to prevent torrential rains from rushing down the mountains and eroding the newly reclaimed land. At the same time, stone masonry and piling are actively carried out to build the new barren land into terraced fields, protecting the soil and water. In terms of planting, climbing crops are mostly planted on general slopes; in newly reclaimed land planted with tall-stalk crops such as corn and sugarcane, tubers and beans, etc., are generally intercropped, so that the roots, vines, and leaves of the crops can play a role in maintaining soil and water. For newly reclaimed land with steep slopes, agroforestry is implemented, or fish-scale pits are dug to prevent soil erosion.

Currently, when nursing crops on newly reclaimed barren land, various places, in order to effectively carry out soil and water conservation, are continuing to level the land and repair terraced fields in conjunction with hoeing and soil cultivation, gradually achieving terracing of barren land; and using mountain streams to divert water for irrigation, transforming the terraced fields with conditions into rice paddies. In Cenxi, LingLe and other counties, most of the newly reclaimed barren land with slopes of around 20 degrees has been terraced. In Laibin, Guixian, Pingnan, Guiping and other counties, some terraced fields, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, have solved the water source problem, and water has been diverted for irrigation, transforming them into terraced fields that can grow rice.

While continuing to repair and consolidate newly reclaimed barren land, various places have launched a "Turn Barren Land into Ripe Land" campaign, taking a series of measures to strengthen field management of newly reclaimed barren land, and striving for balanced production increases. After sowing on newly reclaimed barren land, various places regularly inspect field management work. The Nanning Special Zone transferred nineteen county Party secretaries and four hundred and thirty-three commune Party secretaries to lead more than 60,000 commune members to inspect and nurse the land. More than 90% of the cornfields have been thinned and seedlings have been replanted, achieving full stands. People's communes in various places have transferred a certain number of laborers to form professional teams to specifically nurse crops on newly reclaimed barren land, carrying out timely hoeing, soil cultivation, topdressing, and prevention of diseases, pests, and animal damage. Generally, 50 dan of base fertilizer per mu were applied to the newly reclaimed barren land during reclamation, but this is still far from sufficient compared to mature land. Therefore, in field management, special attention is paid to increasing fertilizer application, and topdressing is generally carried out in conjunction with hoeing and weeding.

In many areas, cadres are also taking the lead in establishing high-yield plots on newly reclaimed barren land, establishing models, and driving overall efforts to strive for high yields on newly reclaimed barren land. For example, Laibin County has established more than 1,000 high-yield valleys and 740 high-yield mountains in more than 300,000 mu of cornfields reclaimed and expanded, covering an area of approximately 100,000 mu, with 10,000 commune and team cadres and more than 50,000 commune members participating in the nursing work of high-yield plots.

In order to further consolidate and develop the production of newly reclaimed barren land, some areas are implementing the policy of combining crop farming and animal husbandry, gradually establishing livestock farms and fertilizer stations around the newly reclaimed barren land. LingLe County has established more than 100 livestock farms mainly raising pigs on newly reclaimed barren land. Laibin County has established more than 3,000 fertilizer stations and a large number of manure pits on newly reclaimed barren land, storing more than 20 million dan of dry and liquid fertilizer, basically meeting the needs of crop topdressing.

### 整修梯田梯地  加强田间管理  树立丰产标兵  广西开展“荒地赶熟地”运动  要一千万亩新垦地高产多收

    整修梯田梯地  加强田间管理  树立丰产标兵
    广西开展“荒地赶熟地”运动  要一千万亩新垦地高产多收
    新华社南宁17日电　广西各地采取有效措施，巩固今年新开垦的一千万亩荒地，并且开展了“荒地赶熟地”的护理运动，力争全面高产多收。经过广大社员的辛勤经营，目前各地新荒地上各类作物生长良好，有些县的一、二类禾苗达到80％以上。早种的爬藤作物，藤叶茂盛，复盖地面。桂南地区早种的玉米，普遍有二尺多高，有的已经开始结苞。
    广西各地新垦荒地一般质量良好，并及时种上玉米、薯类、豆类等杂粮作物和经济作物。但是，新开荒地主要是山地，一般坡度较大，水土容易流失；而且土地瘦薄，易长杂草和发生病虫害。这样，在播种后，就要继续进行整修和加强护理。因此，各级党委在抓好早稻种植的同时，领导社员突出地进行了新垦荒地的巩固和护理工作，以扩大开荒扩种的成果。
    巩固新开荒地的重要一环是防止水土流失。为此，各地在开垦时就在山腰开好排水沟或环山带，防止大雨后山洪下泄，冲刷新垦荒地；同时，积极砌石打桩，把新荒地筑成梯地，保护水土。在种植上，各地对一般坡地，都多种爬藤作物；在种植玉米、甘蔗等高秆作物的新荒地中，一般也套种了薯类、豆类等爬藤作物，让作物的根、藤、叶都发挥保持水土的作用。对于坡度较大的新荒地，便实行农林混种，或挖鱼鳞坑，防止水土流失。
    目前，各地在对新荒地上的农作物进行护理时，为了切实作好水土保持工作，都结合中耕培土，继续进行平整土地、整修梯地，逐步做到荒地梯地化；并利用山间水沟引水灌地，使有条件的梯地变为梯田。岑溪、凌乐等县坡度在二十度上下的新荒地，大部分实现了梯地化。来宾、贵县、平南、桂平等县，有些梯地结合修水利，解决了水源问题，已引水灌田，改造成了能种植水稻的梯田。
    各地在继续整修巩固新荒地的同时，又开展了“荒地赶熟地”的运动，采取了一系列措施，加强新荒地的田间管理，力争平衡增产。新荒地播种后，各地都对田间管理工作经常进行检查。南宁专区抽调十九名县委书记和四百三十三个公社党委书记，率领六万多社员，一面检查，一面护理，有90％以上的玉米地已进行间苗补苗，达到全苗。各地人民公社都抽调一定数量的劳动力，组成专业队，专门护理新荒地上的农作物，适时进行中耕、培土、追肥和防治病、虫、兽害。各地的新荒地，在开垦时，一般每亩都施了五十担基肥，但和熟地比较，就显得很不够。因此在田间管理中，都特别注意增施肥料，结合中耕除草，普遍进行追肥。
    很多地区，还由干部带头，在新开荒地上建立丰产地，树立标兵，带动全面，力争新荒地高产多收。例如来宾县，已在三十万多亩开荒扩种的玉米地里，建立了一千多处丰产垌和七百四十座丰产山，面积约有十万亩，有一万名社、队干部和五万多名社员参加丰产地的护理工作。
    为了进一步巩固和发展新开荒地的生产，有些地区贯彻执行种植业和畜牧业相结合的方针，逐步地在新开荒地周围建立畜牧场和肥料站。凌乐县在新开荒地上，已建立了以养猪为主的畜牧场一百多处。来宾县在新开荒地上建立了三千多个肥料站和大量粪坑，存有干肥水肥二千多万担，基本上满足了作物追肥的需要。
