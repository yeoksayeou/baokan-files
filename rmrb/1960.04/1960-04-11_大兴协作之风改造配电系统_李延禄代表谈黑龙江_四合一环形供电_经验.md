Comrades, fellow Deputies,

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I will resolutely implement them in my work.

I would now like to discuss the issue of transforming the old power distribution system in Heilongjiang Province during the mass technical revolution movement.

“Four-in-One Ring Power Supply” Finds a New Way to Improve Power Supply Capacity

Since the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party issued the great call to the people of the whole country to vigorously carry out the technical revolution, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the staff and workers of the power supply and consumption system of Heilongjiang Province, together with the staff and workers of other fronts in the province, have broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, and vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution in the mass movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. They have achieved some results in adjusting load, increasing output, mastering and developing live-line operation technology, and organizing the people to run electricity. In addition, the successive completion of new power plants and stations has significantly increased the province's power supply capacity, basically ensuring the electricity needs of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. However, the rapid development of production, the continuous leap forward in industrial production, the large-scale technical transformation of agriculture, and the rapid development of other undertakings have led to a sharp increase in the amount of electricity required. Coupled with the relatively weak original power industry foundation in our province and the shortage of power supply equipment, the contradiction between power supply and demand is still relatively tense. How to make the power industry adapt to the development of all sectors of the national economy is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in the socialist construction of our province. Last year, all the staff and workers of the Mudanjiang Hongqi Chemical Plant, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, broke through the shackles of old ideas, and created a new experience in reforming the factory's internal power distribution system on the basis of integrating the scattered experiences of voltage increase and ring power supply in various places. It not only solved the problem of insufficient power supply equipment in the factory and ensured the power consumption needs of production, but also found a new way to improve power supply capacity. Following the Hongqi Chemical Plant, the Harbin Wire Factory, with the support and assistance of relevant departments of the province and city, developed this experience and created a complete set of experiences for comprehensively reforming the power distribution system. The factory realized "simplification, voltage increase, and ring power supply," saving more than 200,000 yuan worth of electrical equipment and materials, and providing the production workshop with sufficient backup power, achieving the goals of supplying more electricity, reducing loss, ensuring safety, saving money, and increasing production. The Provincial Party Committee promptly held an on-site meeting to promote these experiences. After the on-site meeting, Harbin City further developed this experience, turning it from the experience of one factory into the experience of a region. First, in the Nanmalu area, covering an area of 910,000 square meters, 39 large and small enterprises, more than 1,500 organs, schools, and street residents, realized cooperation in power supply and consumption. That is, the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience of combining power and lighting, combining public and civilian use, combining large and small factories, and combining the factory's internal power grid with the public power grid.

As soon as the experience of "four-in-one" ring power supply appeared, it received strong support from the Party and warm welcome from the people. After the Provincial Party Committee proposed to comprehensively promote this experience, a mass movement centered on realizing "four-in-one" ring power supply to reform the power supply and consumption and power distribution systems and improve power supply and consumption capacity quickly swept across all towns, industrial mines, and enterprises in the province. As of March 15, this experience had been promoted in eight cities and ten county towns, and 90 "four-in-one" ring power supply networks had been completed. Harbin City has realized a city-wide closed large ring power supply. As of March 15, incomplete statistics for the province show that due to the promotion of this experience, 654,890 meters of electric wire, 72,160 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, more than 1,400 electric poles, and various other equipment and materials worth 8.87 million yuan have been dismantled. These materials have played an important role in supporting agriculture to achieve electrification and promoting the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The three regions of Harbin, Hejiang, and Mudanjiang alone have supported three economic zones, ten people's communes, and 59 management areas to achieve initial electrification, allowing 14,237 peasant households to have electric lights. One ring power supply network of the Harbin Heping Sugar Factory solved the electricity consumption problem of five villages, six management areas, and 750 residents, realizing the mechanization of rice milling, threshing, grain stripping, straw cutting, and feed crushing. After the Mudanjiang area implemented this experience, 61 management areas realized the mechanization and electrification of non-field operations, shortening the agricultural threshing time from four and a half months to one and a half months, improving efficiency by two times. On the day the Qingmei Management Area of ​​Mishan County was energized, the whole village was filled with gongs and drums. An old woman of 65 years old shed tears of emotion and said: "I thought I would never see electric lights in my life, but now I see them, and I have electric lights. This is the benefit brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Workers of the Harbin Wire Factory praised the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience: "The 'four-in-one' method is good, the old rules and regulations are broken, centralized power supply and decentralized use, safe, reasonable and economical, more power supply and less loss, and promote high production efficiency."

Following the "four-in-one" experience, a new technology substation with "streamlined, weakened, interlocked, remote-controlled, and AC-operated" electrical control systems has recently emerged. It has the characteristics of flexible control, simple operation, simplified equipment, reasonable economy, and safe reliability. Promoting this experience can save a lot of construction funds for the country, save a lot of electrical equipment and building area, and create favorable conditions for comprehensive technical transformation of the electrical control system. At present, all parts of the province are vigorously promoting the above experiences.

Promoting the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience can not only tap the potential of a large number of power supply and transformation equipment, save a lot of electrical materials and manpower, save the country's construction funds, and ensure the leap forward in production and construction, but also increase the safety and reliability of power supply and consumption, and ensure the quality of power. At the same time, it also beautifies the city appearance. It can be seen that the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience not only found a new way to reform the original power supply system, but also pointed out a new direction for building a new and more reasonable power supply and consumption system in the future; it is not just a simple technical experience of reforming the power supply and consumption system, but also an experience of how to fully utilize and give play to the superiority of the socialist system, and an experience of vigorously promoting the communist spirit of collaboration.

Recently, this experience has been applied from the power system to other industries. The staff and workers of the Harbin Bearing Factory applied this experience to the problem of water supply, and carried out large-scale cooperation with factories, enterprises, organs, and residents near the factory, realizing the cooperative "four-in-one" ring water supply, improving water supply capacity, which is beneficial to both production and life, and also beneficial to fire protection work. The coal mining system is using the ring power supply method to simplify wind and water pipelines, and the railway department is also carrying out the reform of ring railways in various cities. Telephone lines are implementing ring telephone networks. These facts vividly illustrate that this experience has important and profound universal significance.

Several Experiences in Promoting "Four-in-One"

From the process of promoting the "four-in-one" ring power supply experience in our province, we have the following experiences:

First, strengthen the leadership of the Party and guide the movement with communist ideology.

The "four-in-one" ring power supply experience broke through the old power supply and consumption method that has been followed for nearly half a century, opened up the boundaries between factories, between dedicated lines and public lines, and turned the "small pot and small stove" into a "public canteen," and the exclusive dedicated line into a public line for everyone. This is not only a major technical reform, but also inevitably causes changes in people's political thoughts. Therefore, at the beginning of promoting this advanced experience, we emphasized treating all kinds of problems that appear in the mass movement with communist ideology, and paid attention to the struggle between two methods and two ideologies. For example, in the early stage of promoting this experience, some people with right-leaning conservative ideas and departmentalism had many concerns. They were afraid of insecurity, afraid of disrupting production order, afraid that the equipment and materials that were dismantled would be transferred away, afraid of losing out on manpower and materials, afraid of trouble, and old factories and old equipment could not be reformed, etc., as reasons to deal with this movement. These ideas actually reflect the struggle between two roads and two methods. In order to thoroughly eliminate right-leaning conservative ideas and departmentalism, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, political and ideological education was strengthened, and methods such as setting up models, organizing visits, and holding on-site meetings were used to criticize and correct these ideas in a timely manner, thereby laying an ideological foundation for promoting this experience. At the same time, organizational leadership was actively strengthened, and corresponding institutions were established at the provincial, prefectural, municipal, county, district, and commune levels to specifically lead the promotion of this experience; leaders in various regions, cities, and counties personally took charge, grasped from beginning to end, regularly conducted inspections, and promptly solved key problems, which effectively promoted the promotion of this experience.

Promoting advanced experience also requires adhering to the idea of ​​continuous revolution, continuously deepening, and improving step by step. The "four-in-one" ring power supply itself has developed from the "simplification, voltage increase, and ring power supply" inside the factory to the regional "four-in-one" ring power supply, and then on this basis has developed into a large ring power supply for the whole city and the whole commune. The emergence of large ring power supply and "five-ization" new technologies for control systems was achieved under the guidance of the idea of ​​continuous revolution.

Second, mobilize the masses and vigorously carry out the "three-way combination" inside and outside the factory.

The "four-in-one" ring power supply is the product of the Great Leap Forward and the crystallization of vigorously carrying out mass movements. Therefore, when promoting the experience of reforming the power supply system and mastering the "five-ization" control technology, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and vigorously carry out mass movements. Where the masses are well mobilized, the promotion of experience is in full swing. In the climax of promoting this experience in Harbin City, the number of people participating in the construction reached more than 6,000. Some units mobilized social forces and mobilized students to help investigate the electricity consumption of residents, and tried every means to mobilize all parties to carry out this work.

Promoting the reform of the power distribution system and implementing the experience of "five-ization" control is not only a meticulous organizational work, but also a major technical work. Therefore, when carrying out the reform and promoting the experience of the power distribution system, in order to speed up the progress and properly solve the problems, it is necessary to carry out the "three-way combination" inside and outside the factory under the leadership of the Party. For example, when the Harbin Wire Factory solved the problem of transformer parallel operation wiring, the first test after wiring could not be operated in parallel. After joint research by leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and mobilizing everyone to use their brains to find solutions, the technical key problem in the voltage change was solved, and this problem was completely solved. In terms of the three-way combination inside and outside the factory, Harbin University of Technology, in order to support the promotion of the "four-in-one" ring power supply and the "five-ization" control experience, sent 98 teachers and students to participate in the work of more than 70 ring power supply networks in Harbin City. They were very motivated, working at the network points during the day and returning to the dormitory at night to calculate and draw drawings to help the network points with planning, thereby solving many specific problems and related technical problems. Some teachers and students also participated in the research on "rational distribution of substation points," "closed network operation," and "seasonal load adjustment and utilization," providing theoretical and practical basis for the further development of the "four-in-one" ring power supply. The Harbin Science and Technology Commission organized the Electric Engineering College and large industrial and mining enterprises to study and solve the voltage increase problem of high-voltage motors, and organized training classes to quickly promote this experience. This "three-way combination" of factories, mining enterprises, universities, and scientific research departments is different from the general "three-way combination," but is a combination of mass movements in three aspects. These three torrents together produce great power, which no difficulty can stop.

Third, carry forward the communist spirit and comprehensively cooperate on a large scale.

The "four-in-one" ring power supply is an experience of vigorously promoting the communist spirit. Therefore, when promoting this experience, there must be close integration between power supply and power consumption departments. The power industry sector should think more for the users and help users eliminate accident points to ensure safe production; while the power consumption sector should also actively strengthen technical management and establish and implement various necessary regulations and systems. At the same time, there should be a communist spirit between factories, and it is necessary to break the boundaries of "separate households and eating small pot meals," give full play to the potential of equipment, and take out the surplus equipment. The newly built Mudanjiang Silk Factory could not be put into production due to lack of power. After realizing the "four-in-one" ring power supply, the textile factory tapped 500 kilowatts of potential to support the silk factory to quickly put into production. The expanded farm tool factory and the newly built brick factory in Mudanjiang City did not have transformers. After realizing the "four-in-one" ring power supply, the steel factory supported these two enterprises with the 1,300 kilovolt-ampere transformers it tapped. At the same time, there are also many large enterprises supporting the surrounding small enterprises, district street industries, residents, and rural areas to solve electricity consumption. The spirit of communist large-scale collaboration was also fully demonstrated in the construction, with mutual exchange of materials, mutual assistance, and large-scale collaboration. Now, there is a new atmosphere everywhere of contributing manpower when needed, contributing materials when available, contributing money when possible, taking the lead in difficulties, and giving way to convenience, and the communist spirit has been greatly promoted.

Although we have done some work in reforming the power supply and consumption system, it is still far from enough. Some reforms still have some problems; management work has not kept up; the development of the promotion of experience is not balanced enough. Therefore, it remains to be continuously strengthened and improved in order to take another step forward on the existing basis.

At present, the experience of reforming the power distribution system in our province is being comprehensively and deeply promoted, and it is developing in the direction of vigorously promoting "three-remote" technology (remote control, remote measurement, remote signaling) in the entire power supply and consumption system. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the general line, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the power industry of our province will surely continue to stride forward on the basis of its existing achievements, so as to better play the role of "pioneer" in the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

    大兴协作之风改造配电系统
    李延禄代表谈黑龙江“四合一环形供电”经验主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告，完全同意全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。并在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现仅就黑龙江省大闹技术革命运动中，改造旧有配电系统问题作如下发言。	“四合一环形供电”为提高供电能力找到了新途径
    从党的八大二次会议向全国人民发出大闹技术革命的伟大号召后，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东思想的指导下，黑龙江省供用电系统职工，与全省其他战线职工一道，在全民性的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革命运动中，破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革新和技术革命，无论在调整负荷、提高出力，掌握和发展带电作业技术以及组织全民办电等方面，都取得了一些成绩，加上新建电厂、电站的相继建成，使我省供电能力有较显著的增加，基本上保证了1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进对电力的需要。但是，生产的迅速发展，工业生产连续跃进，农业大规模地进行技术改造，以及其他各项事业的飞跃发展所需要的电量急剧增加，加上我省原来电力工业基础较为薄弱，供电设备不足，电力供需之间的矛盾仍较紧张。如何使电力工业适应整个国民经济各部门的发展，是我省社会主义建设中的一个迫切需要解决的问题。去年牡丹江红旗化工厂全体职工，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，发扬了敢想敢干的精神，冲破了旧的思想束缚，在综合各地配电系统升压、环形供电等零星经验的基础上创造出改革工厂内部配电系统的新经验。它不仅解决了工厂供电设备不足问题，保证了生产用电的需要，而且为提高供电能力找到了一条新的途径。继红旗化工厂之后，哈尔滨电线厂，在省、市各有关部门的支持和帮助下，发展了这一经验，创造出一套全面改革配电系统的经验。工厂实现了“简化、升压、环形供电”，节约了价值二十余万元的电气设备和器材，并使生产车间有充足的后备电源，达到了多供电、少损耗、安全、节约、增加生产的目的。省委又及时地召开现场会议推广了这些经验。在现场会议后，哈尔滨市又发展了这一经验，使这一经验由一个工厂发展到一个地区。首先在南马路地区九十一万平方米范围内，三十九个大小企业、一千五百多个机关、学校和街道居民中，实现了供用电合作化。即动力与照明合一、公用与民用合一、大厂与小厂合一、厂内电网与公用电网合一的“四合一”环形供电经验。
    “四合一”环形供电的经验一出现，就得到党的大力支持和人民群众的热烈欢迎。省委提出全面推广这一经验后，一个以实现“四合一”环形供电为中心的改革供用电和配电系统提高供用电能力的群众运动，很快就席卷全省各城镇工矿、企业。截止3月15日统计，已在八个市十个县城中推广了这一经验，已完成九十个“四合一”环形供电网。哈尔滨市已实现全市供电闭式大环形。截止3月15日全省不完全的统计，由于推广这一经验，已拆下电线六十五万四千八百九十米，变压器七万二千一百六十千伏安，电柱一千四百多根，以及其他各种设备和器材，价值达八百八十七万元。这些器材对于支援农业实现电气化，促进工农业生产持续全面的大跃进，都起了重要作用，仅哈尔滨、合江、牡丹江三个地区，就支援了三个经济区、十个人民公社、五十九个管理区实现初步电气化，使一万四千二百三十七户农民点上了电灯。哈尔滨和平糖厂一个环形供电网就解决了五个村，六个管理区七百五十户居民的用电问题，使制米、打场、脱谷、铡草、饲料粉碎等工作实现了机械化。牡丹江地区推行这一经验后，使六十一个管理区实现了非田间作业机械化和电气化，使农业脱谷时间由四个半月缩短为一个半月，提高效率二倍。密山县青梅管理区在送电那天，全村锣鼓喧天，一位六十五岁的老大娘感动的流下眼泪说：“我寻思这一辈子看不到电灯，现在看到了，还点上了电灯，这是共产党和毛主席给带来的好处”，哈尔滨电线厂工人歌颂“四合一”环形供电经验：“四合一”办法好，清规戒律打破了，集中供电分散用，安全合理又节约，多供电少损耗，促进生产效率高。
    继“四合一”的经验后，最近又出现了电气控制系统选线化、弱电化、联锁化、远动化、操作交流化的新技术变电所，它具有控制灵活，操作简单，设备简化，合理节约，安全可靠等特点。推广这一经验，可以为国家节省大量的建设资金，节省大量电气设备和建筑面积，并对电气控制系统实行全面的技术改造创造了有利的条件。目前全省各地正在大力推广上述各项经验。
    推广“四合一”环形供电经验，它不仅可以挖掘出大量的供变电设备的潜力，节省大量电气器材和人力，节省了国家的建设资金，保证生产建设的跃进，而且还增加了供用电的安全可靠性，保证了电能的质量。同时还美化了市容。由此可见，“四合一”环形供电经验不仅给原有供电系统的改革找到了一条新的途径，而且为今后建设新的更合理的供用电系统指出了一个新的方向；它不只是一个单纯的改革供用电系统的技术经验，而且是一条如何充分利用和发挥社会主义制度的优越性的经验，是一条大兴共产主义协作之风的经验。
    最近这一经验已由电业系统应用到其他行业。哈尔滨轴承厂职工在供用水问题上运用了这一经验，与本厂附近的工厂、企业、机关、居民等大搞协作，实现了合作化的“四合一”环形供水，提高了供水能力，既有利于生产、生活，也有利于消防工作。煤矿系统正在运用环形供电的方法，简化风、水管路，铁道部门也正在各市进行环形铁路的改革。电话线路实行环行电话网。这些事实都生动的说明了这个经验具有重要而深刻的普遍意义。推广“四合一”的几点体会
    从我省推广“四合一”环形供电经验过程中，我们有下列几点体会：	一、加强党的领导，以共产主义思想指导运动。
    “四合一”环形供电的经验，冲破了近半个世纪以来，沿袭下来的旧的供用电方式，打开了工厂与工厂之间、专用线路和公用线路之间的界限，把“小锅小灶”，变成了“公共食堂”，把独家的专用线，变成大家公用的线路，这不仅仅是一个技术上的大改革，同时也必然引起人们政治思想上的变化。因此，在推广这一先进经验时，一开始，我们就强调以共产主义思想来对待群众运动中出现的各种问题，注意了两种方法，两种思想的斗争。比如在推广这一经验的初期，一些右倾保守思想和本位主义思想的人顾虑重重，他们怕不安全、怕打乱生产秩序、怕拆下来的设备器材被调走，怕出人出物吃了亏、怕麻烦、老厂旧设备没法改革等等为理由来对待这一运动。这些思想实际上反映两条道路和两种方法的斗争。为了彻底肃清右倾保守思想和本位主义思想，在各级党委的统一领导下，加强了政治思想教育工作，通过树标兵、组织参观、召开现场会等办法，及时批判和纠正了这些思想，从而为推广这一经验打下了思想基础。与此同时，积极加强了组织领导，省、专署、市、县、区、公社建立了相应的机构，具体领导这一经验的推广；各地、市、县都是领导亲自挂帅，从头抓到底，经常进行检查，及时解决关键问题，有力地推动了这一经验的推广。
    推广先进经验也要坚持不断革命思想，不断深入，步步提高。“四合一”环形供电本身就是由工厂内部的“简化、升压、环形供电”发展为地区性的“四合一”环形供电，又在这个基础上发展成为全城、全公社的大环形供电。大环形供电和控制系统“五化”新技术的出现，就是在不断革命的思想指导下取得的。	二、发动群众，大搞厂内外“三结合”。
    “四合一”环形供电是大跃进的产物，是大搞群众运动的结晶。因此，在推广改革供电系统经验和掌握“五化”控制新技术时，必须充分发动群众，大搞群众运动。那里群众发动的好，那里经验的推广就热火朝天。哈尔滨市在推广这个经验的高潮中，参加施工的人数达六千多人。有的单位并动员了社会力量，发动学生帮助调查居民用电情况，千方百计地调动各方面的力量开展这一工作。
    推行配电系统改革和实行“五化”控制的经验，不仅是一件细致的组织工作，而且又是一项重大的技术工作。因此，在进行改革和推广配电系统的经验时，为了加快进度，妥善解决问题，必须在党的领导下，认真进行厂内外“三结合”。如哈尔滨电线厂在解决变压器并列运行接线问题时，第一次接完后试验，不能并列运行，经过领导干部、工人、技术人员共同研究，同时又发动大家动脑筋想办法，解决了改压中的技术关键问题，使这一问题得到彻底解决。在厂内外三结合方面，哈尔滨工业大学为了支援推广“四合一”环形供电和“五化”控制经验，曾派出九十八名师生分别参加到哈尔滨市七十多个环形供电网工作。他们干劲很足，白天在网点工作，夜间回宿舍进行计算、画图，帮助网点搞规划，从而解决了许多具体问题和有关技术问题。部分师生还参加了有关“变电点合理分布”“闭式网运行”“季节性负荷调整利用”等问题的研究，为“四合一”环形供电进一步发展提供了理论与实际依据。哈尔滨市科委组织了电工学院和大工矿企业研究解决了高压电动机的升压问题，并组织训练班，迅速推广了这一经验。这个厂矿企业、大专学校、科学研究部门的“三结合”不同于一般的“三结合”，而是三方面的群众运动相结合。这三股巨流在一起，就产生了巨大的力量，是任何困难也阻挡不住的。	三、发扬共产主义精神，全面大协作。
    “四合一”环形供电是一条大兴共产主义之风的经验。因此，在推行这一经验时，供电与用电部门之间必须密切结合。电业部门应更多的为用户着想，帮助用户消灭事故点，以保证安全生产；而用电部门亦应积极加强技术管理，建立与贯彻执行各种必要的规程制度。同时，工厂与工厂之间，应发挥共产主义精神，必须打破“分门别户，吃小锅饭”的界限，充分发挥设备潜力，把多余的设备拿出来。新建的牡丹江丝绸厂因没有电源不能投入生产，在实现“四合一”环形供电后，纺织厂就挖掘出来五百瓩潜力，支援了丝绸厂迅速投入生产。牡丹江市扩建的农具厂、新建的砖厂没有变压器，钢铁厂在实现“四合一”环形供电后，就把挖掘出来的一千三百千伏安变压器支援了这两个企业。同时，还有很多大企业支援周围小企业、区街工业、居民和农村解决用电。在施工中也充分发挥了共产主义大协作精神，互通有无，互相帮助，大搞协作。现在到处呈现出一片有人出人，有物出物，有钱出钱，见困难就上，见方便就让的新气象，共产主义之风大为发扬。
    在改革供用电系统方面我们虽然作了一些工作，但是还很不够，有些改革还存在一些问题；管理工作还跟不上去；推广经验工作的发展还不够平衡，因此，有待于继续努力加强改进，以便在现有基础上再提高一步。
    目前，我省配电系统改革等经验正在全面深入推广，而且正向着在整个供用电系统中大搞“三遥”技术（遥控、遥测、遥讯）的方向发展。我们深信，在党和毛主席的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东思想的指导下，我省电力工业必将在已有成绩的基础上继续阔步前进，从而在国民经济持续全面大跃进中更好地发挥“先行官”的作用。
