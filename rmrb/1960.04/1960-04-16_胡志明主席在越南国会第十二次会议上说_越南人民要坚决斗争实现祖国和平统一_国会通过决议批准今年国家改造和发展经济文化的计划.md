Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 15th: The Twelfth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, lasting five days, victoriously concluded this afternoon. This was the last session of the First National Assembly; the election of the Second National Assembly will be held on May 8th.

　　At today's plenary session, a resolution was unanimously adopted approving the government's proposed 1960 national transformation and economic and cultural development plan, as well as the 1959 national budget implementation and the 1960 national budget. The meeting also unanimously passed the Compulsory Military Service Law.

　　President Ho Chi Minh spoke amidst warm applause. He pointed out the work carried out and the contributions made to the country since the establishment of the First National Assembly in 1946. He said that thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm and heroic fighting spirit of the entire Vietnamese army and people, the victory of the long-term war of resistance was achieved. The Geneva Accords have recognized Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

　　President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that in South Vietnam, the US imperialists and their running dogs are still arbitrarily violating the Geneva Accords and strengthening the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group." The Vietnamese people must resolutely struggle against their sinister conspiracies and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　Chairman Ton Duc Thang delivered the closing remarks. He said that the National Assembly's resolutions on defending peace, building the economy, and developing culture demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in North Vietnam. These resolutions will surely give great encouragement to the construction and struggle of the people throughout the country and the people of South Vietnam. He also pointed out that our resolutions to consolidate North Vietnam are also an important contribution to defending world peace.

　　At the beginning of today's meeting, several representatives of overseas Vietnamese who returned from Thailand came to congratulate the assembly. In their speeches, they expressed their determination to actively participate in the socialist construction of North Vietnam and the struggle for the reunification of the motherland.
