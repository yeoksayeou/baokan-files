Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget. After listening to these two reports, I felt extremely excited and greatly encouraged.

In 1959, like the rest of the country, our factory, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and the guidance of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," especially after our factory workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launched a vigorous and enthusiastic new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, and a very good situation of "people's hearts are excited, enthusiasm is soaring, production is soaring, and all-round leap forward" emerged. The mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution moved forward magnificently. This excellent situation of continued leap forward ensured the rapid development of our factory's production and the leap forward in all aspects of work. The total output value of the entire factory was completed twenty-seven days ahead of schedule, steel was completed twenty-two days ahead of schedule, and steel materials were completed thirty-one days ahead of schedule, comprehensively and victoriously completing the 1959 state plan ahead of schedule.

Through vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, workers put forward more than 36,000 innovation proposals and successfully trial-produced 17 new varieties. Among these innovation proposals, the Qi Zisheng steelmaking group created the three-step desulfurization method and the mixed slag making method, breaking through the sulfur barrier and improving the quality of steel, powerfully countering the right-leaning arguments that high-sulfur pig iron cannot be used to make good steel. Open hearth steelmaking workers, through hard work and research, realized three-tap steelmaking in seven days, increasing output by 30%. Loading and unloading workers, through hard work and adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, mainly indigenous, made indigenous derricks, tunnel conveyors, tipper trucks, and indigenous gantry cranes. Not only did this increase transportation capacity by 80%, but more importantly: the carrying poles that had been weighing on our workers for many years are gone forever, and the ropes and large baskets that had been in our hands year after year have been completely eliminated. Rolling mill workers, after countless failures, successfully researched and developed new pass designs, which increased the first-class product rate of steel from 10% to more than 80%. Countless vivid deeds, too numerous to mention.

It is through vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution that we have increased the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in our factory from 37.5% at the beginning of 1959 to more than 70% by the end of the year, and now it has reached more than 80%. The heavy physical labor that workers have been engaged in for many years, such as: moving, lifting, carrying, pulling, pushing, backing, holding, shoveling, and smashing, has been basically eliminated. Labor productivity has been greatly improved. Last year, the fourth quarter increased by 156% compared with the first quarter, and more than 1,000 employees were transferred to support agriculture and various brother enterprises. Precisely in this way, the safe production of workers has been further guaranteed, and the accident rate has been greatly reduced; it has been achieved that the consumption of raw materials has been greatly reduced, the output and quality have been greatly improved, and the great call of the Party to increase production without increasing personnel, and to increase production and save resources has been realized.

Due to the in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the enthusiasm of all employees of our factory for socialist construction has been unprecedentedly high, and the movement is developing with the momentum of a bamboo breaking. In the movement, new people and new things are emerging one after another, innovative initiatives are blooming everywhere, and the communist style is being further promoted. Staying by the furnace to eat, sleeping by the furnace, working hard, and staying on the front line, a new scene more boiling than the great steelmaking in 1958 has emerged. Striving for the upper reaches, striving for the first, going to the forefront when encountering difficulties, and giving up honors. A huge trend has formed throughout the factory, with helping others as a pleasure and actively delivering experience to the door. The characteristics of the movement are: the momentum is fierce, the movement is fast, the masses are deeply mobilized, and the effect is significant. For example, all the employees of the first branch of our factory expressed to the Party in the movement: "The whole factory is mobilized, and we will vigorously attack high, precise, and cutting-edge technologies. The operation of steel rolling is automated to ensure production, quality, and safety. We will carry out comprehensive trials in February and a major change in the entire factory on May 1st." In this way, under the leadership of the Party, after three days and three nights of hard work, the mechanical automation of steel rolling mills was finally realized. The labor intensity of workers has been greatly reduced, and the heavy physical labor that required each worker to put in more than a thousand steel billets per shift in the past, and to bend over four thousand times, has been completely eliminated, and the output has been increased by 20%. Rolling mill workers used poems to praise: "Automation is not simple, we dare to think and dare to do to break through the sky. From now on, we don't bend over to put down the tongs, and our long-cherished wishes have been realized. We can't finish talking about the Party's kindness." The realization of this automation project has not only greatly promoted the high-speed development of production, but also increased the confidence and courage of employees in vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. In this way, we realized a good start, overfulfilled the first quarter of the national plan, and realized more than 40 automatic and semi-automatic production lines in steelmaking, rolling, wire drawing, and transportation.

We deeply realize that: As a result of vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, key problems that have existed for many years have been broken through, weak links in production have been resolved, labor productivity has been improved, and production levels have gone up; people's superstitions have been eliminated, their minds have been liberated, their enthusiasm has been even greater, the face of production has been greatly changed, and the spiritual outlook has been completely renewed. A new scene of prosperity and vigor has appeared throughout the factory. All of this is the result of the Party's correct leadership, the victory of the General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, the victory of the rectification campaign against right-leaning tendencies, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our experience in vigorously carrying out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is: We must first conscientiously implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and under the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and we must constantly oppose right-leaning tendencies and constantly liberate our minds. Because any revolution and the emergence of new things will inevitably encounter obstacles from old ideas and old habits, and there will inevitably be a struggle between new and old ideas. Only by opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, maintaining vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, and striving for the upper reaches, can we guarantee the healthy development of the movement. Looking at our factory, some comrades, due to insufficient understanding of the situation, shrank back, hesitated, and even were negative and complained in the face of this massive movement. For example, some comrades said: "How can we roll steel if the rolling mill is automated and we put down the tongs?" Some said: "It is impossible to automate the rolling mill at all," etc. In essence, this is because politics has not been put in command and the mind has not been liberated.

In the movement, there are two ways of doing things: one is to do it as soon as you say it, swiftly and resolutely, and see immediate results; the other is to be slow and sluggish. These two methods are essentially a struggle between the two methods of greater, faster, better, and more economical results and less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. We adopted the first attitude. At that time, some people in our factory believed that technological transformation could not be so fast. They said: "Technological transformation is not a trick of blowing air, how can it be done in a few days." However, the employees of the steelmaking department made a huge gantry crane in four days and nights; the wire rope workshop realized seventeen automatic and semi-automatic production lines after a week of hard work. They had to admit defeat in the face of the facts. Facts have proved that we can not only carry out technological transformation, but we can also carry it out at high speed.

In the movement, we adopted the policy of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods when possible, and using indigenous methods when foreign methods were not possible, to vigorously carry out the movement, and opposed the idea of ​​greed for big and foreign things. For example, our factory needed a turntable of more than one ton to transform the conveyor. At that time, there was none. If we ordered and manufactured it, it would take a long time. As a result, the workers used the bottom of a waste steel ladle instead of a turntable, which was more solid than the newly made one, greatly encouraging the masses. Many employees said: "To mobilize the masses to carry out mechanization on a large scale, there are three things that are not needed: no drawings, no design, no purchasing agents." Can be used in four substitutions: "Waste materials replace good materials, old materials replace new materials, inferior materials replace high-quality materials, and broken materials replace whole materials." Using this method, we made indigenous derricks, gantry cranes, and winch soil shovels and other equipment. The workers sang: "Making indigenous equipment ourselves saves people and effort, and the efficiency of work doubles."

To vigorously carry out the technological revolution movement, we must guide the movement with Chairman Mao's thought of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development to promote the continuous development of production. Our approach is "long-term planning, short-term arrangements, focusing on key points, and launching surprise attacks." In different periods and different stages, we make specific arrangements based on different situations to make the workers' struggle goals clearer. For example, when our factory was vigorously carrying out the automation of loading and unloading, we first proposed to the employees to put down the carrying poles and shoulder pads and make indigenous equipment to form a line; when we were vigorously carrying out steel rolling automation, we first proposed to the employees to overcome the retaining ring, to make the steel ingot turn itself over, and to go to the next level to realize an automatic line. In this way, the workers' spirit of innovation became stronger and stronger, and the movement developed vigorously.

In short, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in our factory, like the whole country, has the momentum of a spring tide, unstoppable, and has been carried out vigorously throughout the factory. We are determined to carry forward the victories of the Great Leap Forward in 1959, overcome arrogance and complacency, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs. Adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, adhere to high speed, vigorously attack high, precise, and cutting-edge technologies, and vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution movements centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation.

We are prepared to realize the electrification of metallurgical instruments, the gasification of furnace baking, the multi-head automation of steel rolling, the automatic continuousization of wire ropes, the trackization and river network of transportation, and the iron moldization of casting. The vast number of employees, full of confidence, used poems to praise the beautiful prospects of the future:
	No fire burns the face and hands are away from the iron, instruments control the electrical switches,
	No people are busy on the furnace platform, ensuring quality and safety,
	The labor intensity is greatly reduced, and the steelmaking workers are all smiling.

We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we must continue to leap forward and we will surely continue to leap forward.

    谁说轧钢不能自动化
    刘长福代表谈持续跃进的体会主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告及李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。听了这两个报告，感到万分兴奋，也受到了巨大的鼓舞。
    1959年我厂和全国一样，在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的光辉照耀下和“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，特别是我厂职工热烈响应党的八届八中全会的号召以后，反右倾、鼓干劲，全厂生产掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的新高潮。出现了“人心振奋、干劲冲天、生产猛增、全面跃进”的极好形势，群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，波澜壮阔地向前挺进。这种继续跃进的大好形势，保证了我厂生产的高速发展和各方面工作的跃进。全厂总产值提前二十七天、钢提前二十二天、钢材提前三十一天全面胜利地提前完成了1959年国家计划。
    通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，职工提出了革新建议三万六千余件，试制成功了十七种新品种。在这些革新建议中，有齐子升炼钢小组创造了三步脱硫法和混合造渣法，攻破了硫磺关，提高了钢的质量，有力的回击了那些认为生铁硫高不能炼好钢的右倾论调。平炉炼钢工人通过苦思钻研用七天的时间实现了三槽出钢，提高了产量30％。装卸搬运工人，经过苦钻、苦干采取土洋结合，以土为主的办法，制成了土扒杆、隧道输送机、翻斗车、土龙门吊车等。不仅提高了运输能力80％，更重要的是：多少年来压在我们工人身上的扁担一去不复返了，长年累月在我们手上的绳子和大筐彻底解除了。轧钢工人经过无数次的失败，研究成功了新孔型，使钢材的一级品率由10％，一跃提高到80％以上，无数的活生生的事迹，数不胜数。
    就是通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，才把我厂机械化、半机械化的水平，由1959年初的37.5％到年底提高到70％以上，现在已经达到80％以上。多年来工人从事着的笨重体力劳动，如：搬、抬、扛、拉、推、背、端、铲、砸等基本消灭。劳动生产率大大提高，去年四季比一季提高了156％，输送了一千多名职工支援了农业和各个兄弟企业。正是这样，工人安全生产有了进一步的保证，事故率大大下降；作到了原材料消耗大大下降，产量质量大大提高，实现了党对我们提出的增产不增人，既增产又节约的伟大号召。
    由于技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展，我厂全体职工，社会主义建设热情空前高涨，运动正以破竹之势开展着。在运动中，新人新事层出不穷，革新创举到处开花，共产主义风格更加发扬。守炉餐、伴炉眠、苦心钻研、不下火线，出现了比1958年大炼钢铁时更加沸腾的新景象。争上游、争第一、见困难就上、见荣誉就让。以助人为乐，主动送经上门，在全厂范围内形成了巨大的风潮。运动的特点是：来势猛、动的快、群众发动的深透，效果显著。如我厂一分厂全体职工，在运动中向党表示说：“全厂齐动员，奋起猛攻高精尖，轧钢操作自动化，保产保质保安全，2月全面搞试验，五一全厂大改观。”就是这样在党的领导下，经过了三天三夜奋战，终于实现了钢材轧钢机的机械自动化。大大的降低了工人劳动强度，使过去每个工人每班平均入一千余棵钢坯，需弯四千次腰的笨重体力劳动彻底解除了，而且产量提高了20％。轧钢工人用诗歌颂说：“自动化，不简单，敢想敢干冲破天，从此不弯腰来放下钳，多年的愿望已实现，党的恩情说不完。”这一项自动化项目的实现，不仅大大促进了生产高速度地发展，而且给职工们对大闹技术革新和技术革命增加了信心和勇气。就是这样我们实现了开门红，超额完成第一季国家计划，实现了钢材轧钢机自动化和在炼钢、轧钢、拉丝、运输等方面的四十多项自动、半自动生产线。
    我们深刻的体会到：大闹技术革新和技术革命的结果，多年的关键突破了，生产薄弱环节解决了，劳动生产率提高了，生产水平上去了；人们的迷信破除了，思想解放了，干劲更足了，生产面貌大大改观，精神面貌焕然一新，全厂出现了一片蒸蒸日上、欣欣向荣的新景象。所有这一切，是党正确领导的结果，是总路线的胜利，是大跃进的胜利，是整风反右倾斗争的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中的体会是：必须首先认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，必须不断反右倾、不断解放思想。因为任何一次革命和新事物的出现，必然遭到旧思想和旧习惯势力的障碍，必然会有新旧思想的斗争，只有反掉右倾保守思想，保持旺盛的革命干劲和力争上游的雄心大志，才能保证运动健康的向前发展。就我厂来看，一些同志由于对形势认识不足，在这个声势浩大的运动面前，缩手缩脚，动摇不定，甚至消极、埋怨。如有的同志说：“轧钢机实现自动化，放下钳子，怎么轧钢呢？”有的说：“轧钢机实现自动化根本不可能”等。这实质上是政治没有挂帅，思想没有解放。
    在运动中有这样两种作法，一种是说干就干，雷厉风行，立竿见影；另一种是慢慢腾腾、疲疲沓沓。这两种方法，实质上是多快好省与少慢差费两条方法的斗争。我们采取了第一种态度。当时在我厂有人认为搞技术改造，不能这样快。他们说：“搞技术改造，不是吹口气变戏法，几天能办到。”但是炼钢部职工用四昼夜的时间制成了一部巨型龙门吊车；丝绳车间奋战一周实现了十七条自动、半自动生产线。他们在事实面前只有认输了。事实证明，我们不但能够进行技术改造，而且一定能够高速度地进行技术改造。
    在运动中我们采取了自力更生、土洋结合，能洋则洋，不能洋则土的方针来大搞运动，反对了贪大求洋思想。如我厂改造输送机需要一个一吨多的转盘，当时没有，如订货制造，需很长期间，结果工人就利用废钢包底代替了比新作的还要坚固的转盘，大大鼓舞了群众。许多职工说：“发动群众大搞机械化，有三不用：不用图纸，不用设计，不用采购员。”可以四代：“废料代好料，旧料代新料，劣质料代优质料，碎料代整料”。就是用这样的方法，我们制成了土扒杆，龙门吊车，卷扬土电铲等设备。工人们歌颂说：“自己制造土设备，又省人来又省力，工作效率成倍增。”
    大搞技术革命运动，必须以毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想去指导运动，促进生产不断的发展。我们的作法是“长规划，短安排，抓重点，搞突击”。在不同时期，不同阶段，根据不同的情况，作出具体的安排，使职工奋斗目标更加明确。如我厂在大搞装卸搬运自动化，首先向职工提出先放下扁担和垫肩制造土设备连成一条线；大搞轧钢自动化，首先向职工提出攻克围盘关，要叫钢锭自己翻，更上一层楼实现自动线，这样职工的革新志气越干越足，运动蓬勃向前开展。
    总之，我厂技术革新和技术革命运动和全国一样，有如春潮泛滥之势，锐不可当，在全厂范围内轰轰烈烈的开展起来。我们决心在1959年大跃进的胜利基础上，戒骄戒傲，高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚决地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针。坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚持高速度，猛攻高精尖，大搞机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。
    我们准备实现冶炼仪表电气化、烘炉煤气化、轧钢多头自动化、丝绳自动连续化、运输轨道化、河网化、铸造铁模化。广大职工，满怀信心地用诗歌颂未来的美好前景说：
        火不烤脸手离铁，仪表控制电开关，
        炉台不见人忙乱，保质保量保安全，
        劳动强度大大减，炼钢工人齐开颜。
    我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下，一定要继续跃进，一定能继续跃进。
