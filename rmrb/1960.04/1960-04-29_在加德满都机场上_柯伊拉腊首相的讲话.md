Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Guests and Friends,

It is indeed a great pleasure and satisfaction for me to have this opportunity to welcome Your Excellency, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi, and the other distinguished guests accompanying you to the soil of Nepal.

I recall with pleasure that you once visited Nepal as our esteemed guest, and therefore we regard you as our old friend. Moreover, if we consider the geographical proximity, cultural exchanges, and historical relations between our two countries, the long-standing nature of the close relationship existing between our two countries becomes all the more evident.

Not long ago, I and some of my colleagues made an official visit to your great country. By all accounts, that visit contributed to the enhancement of friendship between us. I believe that your friendly visit this time will promote the cause of our traditional friendship.

I wish to assure Your Excellency that I myself, my government, and the people of Nepal will earnestly endeavor to make your stay in Nepal pleasant and successful.

Welcome to Nepal!

Long live Nepal-China friendship!

Long live Panchsheel!

    在加德满都机场上
    柯伊拉腊首相的讲话
    新华社加德满都26日电　（迟到）尼泊尔首相毕·普·柯伊拉腊今天在周恩来总理到达加德满都时在机场上发表讲话欢迎周恩来总理，讲话全文如下：周恩来总理阁下，尊敬的客人们和朋友们，
    我这次有机会在尼泊尔国土上欢迎阁下和副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅阁下以及和您同来的其他贵宾，的确感到非常愉快和满意。
    我愉快地回忆到，您以前曾经一度作为我们尊敬的客人来到尼泊尔，所以我们把您看作是我们的老朋友。而且，如果我们考虑到我们两国之间地理上的接近、文化上的往来和历史上的关系，存在于我们两国之间的密切关系的悠久性质就格外明显了。
    仅在不久以前，我和我的一些同事到您们伟大的国家作了一次正式访问。据各方面认为，那次访问有助于我们之间友谊的增进。我认为，您这次友好访问将促进我们的传统友谊的事业。
    我希望向阁下保证，我本人、我的政府和尼泊尔人民将认真地努力，使您在尼泊尔的逗留愉快和成功。
    欢迎前来尼泊尔！
    尼泊尔—中国友好万岁！
    潘查希拉万岁！
