Going to the Countryside and Factories to Serve the People
By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    Recently, when we visited the Bucharest Municipal Theater, eighty-seven-year-old People's Actor Bulandra had already put on makeup and was preparing to appear on stage. In a brief conversation with her, we learned that this old actor, who is also the director of the theater, not only performs frequently at the theater but also goes to other places to perform for workers and farmers. Bulandra said: "Before liberation, I also led a theater, but I never thought of performing for the working people. Now the working people are the masters of the country, and actors should serve them." In the past six months, this theater has performed two or three times a month in areas outside the capital. In addition, they also send forty-two actors to provide free guidance to the cultural and artistic activities of forty-two factories in the capital. Like the actors of the Bucharest Municipal Theater, Romanian actors not only strive to allow more working people to appreciate their art but also want to make this art the art of the working people themselves. In order to achieve this goal, last winter and this spring, theaters and symphony orchestras across the country actively participated in activities such as going to the countryside and factories to perform for workers and peasants and providing free guidance to amateur mass art troupes. Now, these activities have been included in the work plans of various theaters and symphony orchestras as their regular tasks.
    Many composers and singers also use their spare time to guide mass song and dance troupes and choirs. In Bucharest alone, more than sixty composers and singers are engaged in this kind of beneficial voluntary activity.
    At present, there are more than two hundred literary and visual arts groups among the workers and peasants across Romania. Many writers, poets, and artists volunteer to be instructors for these groups. For example, Professor Balau, a painter, provides guidance to the painting and sculpture group of the "Wire Industry" factory twice a week.
    In the past year or two, Romanian writers have become more closely connected with socialist construction and the lives of the working people. Many writers have gone to the countryside and factories to collect creative materials and assist the masses in carrying out cultural activities. Whether in workshops, collective farms, or construction sites, one can see the lively scenes of writers meeting with the working people, and even in sports fields, one can encounter poets reciting their new works to athletes. Last year, 100,000 working people talked with writers or listened to their speeches. This year, more writers will go to factories or rural areas to understand the lives and work of the working people.
    Romanian artists are also increasingly going deep into life and into practice. Even seventy-year-old painter Kardash often appears in the villages of the Dobruja Plateau or the ports along the Danube River. He uses his brush to depict the selfless labor and happy lives of the workers and peasants. The great socialist construction and the people engaged in this construction have become the main creative themes of artists.
    In the past year, Romania has made great achievements in educating the masses in cultural, scientific, technological, and political affairs. This work is mainly carried out through various report meetings, scientific work teams, and people's universities organized in cities and rural areas. Last year, a total of about 100,000 report meetings on industrial and agricultural production, political affairs, and cultural knowledge were held, with more than 13 million people attending. In the past year or so, the number of scientific work teams and people's universities, which are warmly welcomed by the masses, has increased two or three times.
    The main reason for achieving these achievements is that tens of thousands of intellectuals have actively participated in the above-mentioned work without regard to remuneration or hard work. Among them are academicians of the Academy of Sciences, university professors, middle school teachers, scientific researchers, journalists, legal workers, and other broad intellectuals.
    Hundreds of thousands of intellectuals who participate in scientific work teams often give up their Sunday rest time to go to the countryside to answer various questions for farmers. In order to deliver knowledge to the farmers, the members of the scientific work teams do not care about the long distances and the cold, heat, wind, and rain. Among them, some people have never been absent for a single time for several years. Rodica, a female teacher at a middle school in Constanta Prefecture, has participated in scientific work teams going to the countryside thirty-eight times in the past two years. Now, the scientific work teams active throughout Romania have become an indispensable part of rural cultural life.
    Under the guidance of the Party, the broad masses of intellectuals in Romania are paying more and more attention to establishing close ties with the working people, and they regard helping the workers and peasants improve their cultural level as their glorious duty. Facts have proved that they have made great contributions in this regard. The spirit of intellectuals serving the people enthusiastically has been unanimously praised by the masses. On the other hand, intellectuals have also received vivid education in their contact with the working people. They realize that the working people are the great builders of the new society.
    Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, recently called on intellectuals at the Cluj Prefecture Party Congress to go deeper into reality, connect with the masses, and contribute all their knowledge and talents to the cause of socialism. Under this call, Romanian intellectuals will serve the people more enthusiastically and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. (Attached picture)

### 下乡下厂为人民服务

    下乡下厂为人民服务
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    最近，在我们访问布加勒斯特市立剧院时，八十七岁的人民演员布兰德拉已经化好装，准备出场。在同她简短的交谈中，我们了解到，这位担负着剧院经理职务的老演员，不但经常在剧院登台，还到外地为工人和农民演出。布兰德拉说：“我在解放前也领导一个剧院，那时根本没有想到演给劳动人民看。现在劳动人民是国家的主人，演员应该为他们服务。”近半年来，这个剧院每月都到首都以外的地区演出两三次。此外，他们还派四十二名演员经常义务辅导首都的四十二个工厂的文艺活动。和布加勒斯特市立剧院的演员一样，罗马尼亚的演员们，不但争取更多的劳动人民能够欣赏他们的艺术，而且要使这种艺术成为劳动人民
  自己的艺术。为了实现这个目的，在去冬今春，全国的剧院和交响乐团都积极参加了下乡下厂、为工农演出和义务辅导群众业余文艺团体的活动。现在，各剧院和交响乐团已经把这些活动订在工作计划中，作为自己的经常任务。
    许多作曲家、歌唱家，也利用自己的业余时间，指导群众性的歌舞团和合唱队。单是在布加勒斯特市，就有六十多名作曲家和歌唱家进行着这种有益的义务活动。
    现在，在罗马尼亚全国的工农群众中，有两百个以上的文学小组和造型艺术小组。有许多作家、诗人和艺术家，自愿作这些小组的辅导员。例如，画家巴拉乌教授，每星期都对“铁丝工业”工厂的绘画和雕刻小组辅导两次。
    近一两年来，罗马尼亚作家同社会主义建设和劳动人民生活的联系更加密切了。许多作家都下乡下厂，搜集创作材料和协助群众开展文化活动。不论在车间、农庄或建筑工地，都可以看到作家同劳动人民会见的生动场面，甚至在运动场上也会遇到诗人在向运动员们朗诵自己的新作。去年有十万名劳动群众同作家交谈或听了作家的讲话。今年将有更多的作家到工厂或农村中去，了解劳动人民的生活和工作。
    罗马尼亚的艺术家们也愈来愈多地深入生活、深入实际了，就连七十岁的老画家卡尔达什，也经常出现在多布鲁查高原的村落或是多瑙河畔的港口。他用自己的画笔描绘着工农群众的忘我劳动和幸福生活。伟大的社会主义建设和从事这种建设的人，已经成了艺术家的主要创作题材。
    罗马尼亚最近一年来，在向群众进行文化、科技知识和政治时事教育方面取得了巨大成就。这项工作，主要是通过在城市和农村中组织的各种报告会、科学工作队和人民大学等形式进行的。去年一共举行了大约十万次有关工农业生产、政治时事和文化知识的报告会，听讲的群众达到一千三百多万人次。最近一年多来，受到群众热烈欢迎的科学工作队和人民大学的数目增加了两三倍。
    能取得这些成就，主要是因为有几万名知识分子不计报酬、不辞辛苦地积极参加了上述工作。他们之中包括科学院院士、大学教授、中学教员、科学研究人员、新闻工作者、法律工作者等广大知识分子。
    参加科学工作队的成百上千的知识分子，经常放弃星期天的休息时间，到农村去为农民解答各种问题。为了把知识给农民送上门，科学工作队的成员都不顾路途遥远和寒暑风雨。在他们中间，有些人数年如一日，从不缺席一次。康斯坦萨州的中学女教员罗迪卡，在近两年中已经参加科学工作队下乡三十八次。现在，活跃在罗马尼亚全国的科学工作队，已经成为农村文化生活中不可缺少的一部分。
    罗马尼亚的广大知识分子，在党的教导下，愈来愈重视同劳动人民取得紧密联系，他们把帮助工农群众提高文化水平看作自己的光荣职责。事实证明，他们已经在这方面作出了很大贡献。知识分子热情为人民服务的精神受到了群众的一致赞扬。另一方面，知识分子在同劳动人民的接触中，也受到了生动的教育。他们认识到，劳动人民是新社会的伟大建设者。
    罗马尼亚工人党第一书记乔治乌—德治同志，最近在克鲁日州党代表会议上，号召知识分子要更加深入实际，联系群众，把自己的全部知识和才能贡献给社会主义事业。罗马尼亚知识分子将会在这个号召下，更加热情地为人民服务和积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。（附图片）
