美帝国主义惊惶失措正在加紧干涉进行欺骗阴谋扶植新的卖国政权
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th - The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today calling on the South Korean people, after achieving the first step of victory in the struggle against the US-Lee group, to continue to ignite a higher flame of struggle, drive away the American aggressors, and thoroughly abolish the Lee Seung-man fascist ruling apparatus.

The editorial said: The statement issued by the joint conference of Korean political parties and social organizations held in Pyongyang on April 27 regarding the current situation in South Korea has put forward a clear program of struggle for the South Korean people who have risen up to continue to move forward. From the overall point of view of the movement, the current situation shows that the great achievements made by the South Korean people with blood are only the first step in the transformation of South Korea, and the struggle has only just begun. The editorial pointed out that now the traitor Lee Seung-man has stepped down in South Korea, and his fascist government has gone bankrupt, but the fascist terror ruling apparatus from top to bottom remains intact. The tool for suppressing and massacring the people - the South Korean police - has not only not been disbanded, but the police organs that collapsed under the blows of the people of Seoul have openly revived. All the fascist laws made by the Lee Seung-man puppet regime to suppress the people are still preserved as they were. In particular, the traitor Lee Seung-man has not been arrested, nor have Lee Seung-man's lackeys, bullies, and bureaucrats been removed from the power organs. All this proves that it is still far from the conditions required by the South Korean people with blood.

The editorial said: The collapse of the Lee Seung-man puppet government has not only fundamentally shaken the foundation of the colonial rule of the American aggressors in South Korea, but also greatly hit the colonial policy of American imperialism in Asia, and also exposed the ugly fascist essence of American-style "freedom" and "democracy" which American imperialists have been clamoring and promoting in South Korea for fifteen years to the world without exception.

The editorial said: American imperialism is extremely panicked, so on the one hand, in order to deceive the South Korean people, it is creating a new puppet regime to replace the Lee Seung-man puppet regime, and on the other hand, in order to maintain its colonial rule, it is carrying out new suppression. American imperialism's act of letting Huh Jung, who was a traitor with Lee Seung-man, be the head of the so-called "caretaker cabinet" concentrates its deceptive tactics. Lee Seung-man appointed Huh Jung as "Foreign Minister" on the eve of his resignation. Huh Jung said at a press conference held after he became the head of the "caretaker cabinet": "In the future, we will work to further strengthen economic and military relations with the United States." This fully shows that Huh Jung and Lee Seung-man are birds of a feather.

The editorial said that it can be clearly seen that the loyal servants of American imperialism, who live in the same room with Lee Seung-man and betray the nation together, will not come up with anything new despite clamoring for "reorganization" and "new elections."

The editorial said that it can also be fully seen from the clamor of US President Eisenhower at a press conference on April 27 what American imperialism is delusional about the current situation in South Korea. Eisenhower said that "it is regrettable that violence occurred that caused the Lee Seung-man government to collapse." He said that the old dog Lee Seung-man was a "great man" and a "great patriot." The editorial pointed out that this openly exposed the United States' intention to maintain a fascist terror and traitorous regime in South Korea that is exactly the same as the Lee Seung-man puppet regime.

The editorial said: As long as the American imperialist aggressors continue to occupy South Korea, the urgent demands of the South Korean people, which are vital to their survival, can never be realized. Only by realizing the statement of the joint meeting of leaders of political parties and social organizations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can the South Korean people not let the blood shed for overthrowing the Lee Seung-man puppet regime be shed in vain, and only then will there be a way out for the noble cause of striving for freedom, democracy and survival.

The editorial said: The South Korean people who have risen up to fight must continue to attack, not giving American imperialism and the Lee Seung-man traitorous group a chance to breathe.

The editorial said: At present, everything in South Korea lies in the South Korean people shattering the enemy's cunning deceptive tactics and continuing to ignite the flames of struggle higher and higher everywhere. At the same time, the people of northern Korea must set off a revolutionary upsurge of socialist construction in order to support the struggle of the people in the southern half and to rescue them from the abyss of suffering.

The editorial said: At present, the just struggle of the South Korean people is receiving the full support of all peace-loving people in the world. The patriotic forces of North and South Korea unite, set off a high tide of national salvation struggle, will surely eliminate the dark rule in South Korea, raise a bright new sun, and the day of national reunification will surely come.

### 彻底废除傀儡政权赶走美国侵略者

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”号召南朝鲜人民再接再厉继续斗争
    彻底废除傀儡政权赶走美国侵略者
    人民斗争已获初步胜利但是南朝鲜的法西斯统治机构仍然原封未动
    美帝国主义惊惶失措正在加紧干涉进行欺骗阴谋扶植新的卖国政权
    新华社平壤29日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，号召南朝鲜人民在反对美李集团的斗争中取得第一步胜利之后，继续燃起更高的斗争火焰，赶走美国侵略者，彻底废除李承晚法西斯统治机构。
  社论说：4月27日朝鲜各政党社会团体在平壤就目前南朝鲜局势举行的联席会议所发表的声明，为起来斗争的南朝鲜人民提出了今后继续前进的明确的斗争纲领。从运动的整体来看，目前一切局势说明，南朝鲜人民以鲜血取得的巨大成就，只不过是在南朝鲜开始变革的第一步，斗争只不过刚开始。社论指出，现在南朝鲜李承晚卖国贼下台了，他的法西斯政府破产了，但是法西斯恐怖统治机构自上而下还是原封未动，镇压和屠杀人民的工具——南朝鲜的警察不仅没有解散，而且在汉城人民打击下崩溃了的警察机构又公然复活了，李承晚傀儡政权制造的一切镇压人民的法西斯法令还原样保存着。尤其是还没有逮捕卖国贼李承晚，也没有从政权机关中清除李承晚的走狗、恶霸和官僚。这一切证明距离南朝鲜人民以鲜血要求的条件还很远。
    社论说：李承晚傀儡政府的崩溃，不仅从根本上动摇了美国侵略者在南朝鲜的殖民统治基础，而且大大打击了美帝国主义对亚洲的殖民政策，又向全世界无遗地揭露了美帝国主义者十五年来在南朝鲜叫嚷和宣传的美国式的“自由”和“民主”的丑恶的法西斯本质。
    社论说：美帝国主义极度地惊惶失措了，所以一方面为了欺骗南朝鲜人民制造新的傀儡政权来代替李承晚傀儡政权，另一方面又为了维持它的殖民统治基础，进行新的镇压。美帝国主义让同李承晚一起当卖国贼的许政当了所谓“看守内阁”的头目，这就集中地表现了它的骗人手法。李承晚在下台前夕就把许政任命为“外交部长官”了。许政在当上“看守内阁”的头目后举行的记者招待会上说：“今后要为进一步密切同美国的经济和军事关系而努力”。这就充分地说明了许政和李承晚是一丘之貉。
    社论说，可以很明显地看出，同李承晚共居一室，一道卖国背叛民族的美帝国主义的忠实奴仆，尽管叫嚷什么“改组”、什么“新选举”，也不会变出什么新东西来。
    社论说，从美国总统艾森豪威尔4月27日在记者招待会上的叫嚣中，也可以完全看出美帝国主义就南朝鲜的目前局势妄想着什么。艾森豪威尔说，“发生了暴力行为使李承晚政府崩溃，是令人遗憾的。”说李承晚老狗是“伟大的人物”、“伟大的爱国者”。社论指出，这就公开暴露了美国要在南朝鲜维持和李承晚傀儡政权一模一样的法西斯恐怖的卖国政权。
  社论说：只要美帝国主义侵略者继续盘踞在南朝鲜，就决不能实现南朝鲜人民生死攸关的迫切要求。南朝鲜人民只有实现朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党和社会团体领导人联席会议的声明，才能不使为打倒李承晚傀儡政权流的鲜血白流，才是为了争取自由、民主和生存的崇高目的的出路。
    社论说：起来斗争的南朝鲜人民必须继续进攻，不让美帝国主义和李承晚卖国集团有喘气的机会。
    社论说：目前南朝鲜的一切，全在于南朝鲜人民粉碎敌人的狡猾的骗人手法，继续不断地在各处更高地燃起斗争的火焰。与此同时，朝鲜北部人民为了声援南半部人民的斗争，为了从水深火热中拯救他们，必须更加掀起社会主义建设的革命高潮。
    社论说：目前，南朝鲜人民的正义斗争受着全世界一切爱好和平人民的完全支持。南北朝鲜人民一切爱国力量团结起来，掀起救国斗争的高潮，必将消除南朝鲜的黑暗统治，升起光明的新太阳，祖国统一的日子必将到来。
