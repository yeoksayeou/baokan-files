Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as the report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. After listening to these reports, I feel boundless excitement. Over the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, our country's various undertakings have achieved tremendous successes in every aspect.

Now, I would like to report to the congress on the situation of mountain area construction in Jiangxi:

Jiangxi has many mountains, and its mountain areas are very rich in plant, mineral, hydropower, and animal resources. However, in the past, the feudal ruling class and the Kuomintang reactionaries only knew how to exploit the people and would not engage in mountain area construction. The general public, unable to bear the exploitation, were even less capable of developing the mountain areas, resulting in the endless natural resources being wasted in the mountains, which was truly a pity.

In order to develop the mountain areas and send cadres down to work and temper themselves, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee transferred more than 50,000 cadres in the winter of 1957, launching a massive advance into the main mountain areas throughout the province. In just over two years, a total of 209 state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms (总场) and 465 branch farms (分场) have been established in various large and small mountain areas throughout the province. A total of more than 2.8 million mu of land has been reclaimed and more than 36 million mu of forest has been planted. The total output value in 1959 reached 520 million yuan, of which the total agricultural output value was 376 million yuan and the total industrial output value was 144 million yuan. The development has been extremely rapid. Rich in resources, the mountains are full of treasures.

Before coming to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress, I visited the Great Maoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm for a short inspection. Now, I will use this reclamation farm as an example to introduce some of its situation, as an overview illustrating the brilliant achievements Jiangxi has made in building mountain areas.

Great Maoshan Mountain is located in Dexing County in northeastern Jiangxi Province. The highest peak has an altitude of more than 1,700 meters, standing tall in the mountains of the Huaiyu Mountains. The area is vast, with more than 2.3 million mu of mountain area and more than 240,000 mu of cultivated land. In the past, Comrade Fang Zhimin led the Red Army here to engage in heroic and tenacious struggles against the Kuomintang reactionary army, making it one of the old revolutionary base areas in northeastern Jiangxi.

In this mountain, with overlapping peaks and abundant resources, the mountains and valleys are full of inexhaustible plant raw materials for papermaking, oil extraction, winemaking, and forest chemical industry. Underground, there are treasures such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and coal. In the mountain streams, there are clear springs and waterfalls, which are ideal power for generating electricity. In the deep mountains, there are tigers, leopards, jackals, wild boars, wild cattle, deer, monkeys, wild cats, pangolins, porcupines, squirrels, otters, foxes, and masked palm civets, etc., and tens of thousands of animal hides can be produced every year. Furthermore, there are vast pastoral areas in the mountains. Only because this mountain area was severely damaged during the Kuomintang rule, many farmers at the foot of the mountain were slaughtered or driven away; many villages were also burned down. This made the entire rich "Mountain of Treasures" sparsely populated, with desolate fields, groups of wild animals, and a desolate scene. Treasure Mountain has treasure collectors.

In November 1957, 568 cadres were first sent to the mountain to cut through thorns and weeds to establish the Great Maoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm. Through hard work, it gradually expanded. The original farmers in the mountain area who had gone out to make a living saw that the situation in the mountain had improved, and returned to their hometowns one after another. Furthermore, demobilized soldiers joined, so the organization continued to grow. Up to now, the entire farm has a total of 35,406 staff members and their families. In addition to the main farm, there are also nine branch farms. The remote mountain valleys have suddenly become prosperous.

Their method of managing the mountain areas is to first use the original very lush plants on the mountain for production. Masson pine is the most abundant on the mountain, with reserves of more than 3 million cubic meters. They thin out or prune the densest pine forests to make planks, railway sleepers, or pit props, and supply them to the country in large quantities. Pine branches, pine needles, and dead pines can all be comprehensively utilized for firewood and charcoal; or for extracting rosin, turpentine, aromatic oil; or dry-distilled artificial gasoline, diesel, mineral processing oil, lubricating oil, machine oil, spindle oil, and asphalt, etc. Bamboo is also abundant in this mountain area, and they also properly thin it out and transport it down the mountain to meet the needs of the cities. At the same time, they also carry out the work of clearing the mountains and cultivating forests, cutting down all the miscellaneous firewood and reeds while retaining tree species with higher economic value. The chopped miscellaneous wood can also be comprehensively utilized. Wild bayberries are found everywhere in the mountains, and in normal years, more than 2 million jin can be produced, which have always fallen naturally and rotted. Now, the farm uses them to make wine. In 1959, 170,000 jin of bayberries were picked and 180 tons of fragrant and sweet wine were brewed. In 1960, it is estimated that 530,000 jin can be picked and 400 tons of fine wine can be made. There are also wild pears, dates, apples, grapes, plums, peaches, Chinese gooseberries, cherries, olives, hawthorns, and strawberries in the mountains. They either use them to make wine, or make various dried fruits, preserves, jams, and juices for sale. There are also many wild kudzu vines, and they dig up their roots to make alcohol. Any plants with starch or sugar content are utilized to make starch or wine. Now, there are wineries everywhere in the mountains, and there are many types of wine. Reeds grow everywhere on the mountain, and they are used to make paper. Many lycoris radiata grow on the mountain, which have always been regarded as useless by people. They are used to distill acetone, butanol, and ethanol, and high-priced chemical products are obtained. The forest is humid and suitable for cultivating edible fungi, and they use it to plant shiitake mushrooms, straw mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, and various edible fungi. There are also many medicinal materials there, including licorice, rhubarb, cinnamon, and Chinese olives. In addition, there are no less than 100 kinds of plants such as safflower, papaya, rock fungus, aconite, Belamcanda chinensis, sweet flag, wild chrysanthemum, cicada slough, Trichosanthes kirilowii, gallnut, Magnolia officinalis var. biloba, etc. They are also starting to study and utilize them. In addition, there are more than 100,000 cork oaks, and many large camellia oleifera, which are trees of great economic value. They are now being strictly protected and efforts are being made to propagate them. In short, they are further investigating and studying all the plants that can be utilized, and are trying to utilize them. In the past two years, 120,000 mu of forest have been planted and 44,000 mu of mountain forest have been tended. More than 5,000 mu of wasteland have been opened up to cultivate seedlings or plant crops.

Regarding the utilization of mineral resources, iron smelting has already been carried out, and sulfur is used to make pesticides and sulfuric acid. Other mineral deposits will be planned for development and utilization. Diversified operations, everything prospers.

Regarding hydropower resources, in addition to directly using the water flow in the mountain streams to supply power to various sawmills, grain and feed processing plants, the farm has also built small reservoirs in the mountains for farmland irrigation. Fish are raised in the reservoirs and small mountain ponds. This year, it is planned to raise 1 million fish. Geese and ducks are also raised on the water surface. A 1,100 kW hydropower station and eight small power stations have been built in the larger reservoirs to ensure the electricity supply for industrial use and lighting in the farm. Now, there are electric lights everywhere in the farm, and the remote mountain valleys are brightly lit.

Regarding animal resources, the animal species in the mountain have not yet been fully utilized. However, there are currently more than 29,000 pigs, more than 100,000 poultry, more than 300 cattle, 1,500 goats, 400 fine-wool sheep, more than 2,000 rabbits, and 350 colonies of bees raised in the mountain area.

In these two years, the farm has made great efforts to build small factories using the above-mentioned resources. It has already built wineries, rosin factories, dead pine dry distillation plants, artificial petroleum plants, baking gum plants, machinery factories, iron smelting plants, brick and tile factories, food processing plants, edible fungus seed plants, and sawmills, with a total of 94 factories and more than 100 kinds of industrial products.

Regarding transportation, five highways have now been built, with a total length of 180 kilometers, and major mountain areas can be directly accessed by cars. In addition, more than 200 kilometers of forest roads have been built. More than 175 kilometers of small rivers in the mountain area have also been dredged to facilitate the operation of small rafts or the transportation of bamboo and wood. However, the mountain area is very large and rich in resources. There are many bamboo and wood that have been felled and piled up in the mountains, and cannot be transported out in time, while the cities are in great need of these materials. The mountain transportation problem must be further helped to solve.

A Communist Labor University branch has also been established in this comprehensive reclamation farm, with a total of 1,006 male and female students, divided into agronomy and forestry departments. The four-year system: in the first academic year, there are six months of labor, five months of study, and one month of rest; in the second academic year, there are five months of labor, six months of study, and one month of rest; in the third and fourth academic years, there are four months of labor, seven months of study, and one month of rest. They study what they do, closely integrating with practice. Each person has an income of 17 yuan per month from their labor, which is more than enough to support themselves. More than 90% of these students are children of workers and peasants, who had few opportunities to go to school in the past, so their desire for education is urgent, they work very hard, and they are making rapid progress. The main campus is located in the suburbs of Nanchang, and each reclamation farm has its branch. The establishment of this type of school not only does not require state funding, but also provides people with the opportunity to receive specialized education, helping to popularize education, and it is indeed a new type of proletarian school. In addition, a scientific research institute has also been established in the farm.

The farm has built many houses, including Red and Expert Universities, cinemas, hospitals, primary schools, nurseries, public canteens, etc., and everyone lives very well. At first, some cadres were not at ease when they went to the mountains, but now they are willing to work in the mountains for the rest of their lives. A small number of cadres who used to despise labor and the working people are now able to work closely with the masses and very happily. Therefore, the local people generally recognize that this mountain area has "changed people, changed mountains, changed atmosphere, and reaped double harvests in ideology and production."

This reclamation farm has done a lot of work, and many people think that the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee must have invested a lot of funds. In fact, only 400,000 yuan was allocated by the Provincial People's Committee in 1957 as start-up expenses, and no further investment has been made since then. Furthermore, in 1958, the farm's production income reached 3.75 million yuan; in 1959, the income was more than 11 million yuan; and in 1960, it will strive to achieve an income of 30 million yuan. This is truly "more, faster, better, and more economical" in the Great Leap Forward.

Fellow delegates, the situation has only been introduced here. From these facts, it is not difficult to explain that developing mountain areas has unlimited prospects and much can be accomplished. We should value mountain areas, learn more about mountain areas, find ways to utilize mountain areas, and vigorously advance into mountain areas! Are these suggestions appropriate? Please correct me. Finally, I wish all the delegates good health!

专栏：

    大茅山兴盛起来了
    杨惟义代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的报告。听了这些报告，我感到无限兴奋。过去一年来，我国各项事业，在党中央和毛主席英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝的光辉照耀下，不论是那一方面，成绩都是很巨大的。
    现在，我向大会汇报一些关于江西建设山区的情况：
    江西境内多山，山中植物资源、矿物资源、水力资源和动物资源，都是非常丰富的。可是以前封建统治阶级和国民党反动派，只晓得剥削人民，那里会建设山区。一般人民不堪剥削更无力去开发山区，致使无穷无尽的天然资源，废弃在山，实在可惜。
    江西省委、省人委为了开发山区和下放干部劳动锻炼，于1957年冬，抽调干部五万多人，浩浩荡荡，向全省各主要山区大进军。仅仅两年多的时间，全省各大小山区，已建立全民所有制国营综合垦殖场的总场二百零九个，分场四百六十五个。共垦地二百八十多万亩，造林三千六百多万亩。1959年的总产值可达五点二亿元，其中农业总产值为三点七六亿元，工业总产值为一点四四亿元。发展极为迅速。资源丰富，遍山是宝
    这次我来北京出席全国人民代表大会之前，曾到过大茅山综合垦殖场，进行了短期的视察。现在我就以这个垦殖场为例，介绍它的一些情况，作为说明江西在建设山区中所取得的辉煌成就的一个概况。
    大茅山位于江西东北部德兴县境，最高主峰的海拔，有一千七百多公尺，屹立于怀玉山脉的丛山峻岭中。面积广大，山场有二百三十多万亩，耕地有二十四万余亩。以前方志敏烈士，率领红军，曾在此间与国民党反动军队，作过英勇顽强的斗争，是赣东北老革命根据地之一。
    在这个峰峦重叠，资源丰富的大茅山中，漫山遍谷都是取之不尽，用之不竭的造纸、榨油、酿酒和林产化工的植物原料；地下有金、银、铜、铁和煤炭等宝藏；山涧中，有清澈的泉流和瀑布，是最理想的发电动力；大深山中，有虎、豹、豺狼、野猪、野牛、麂、猴、野猫、穿山甲、豪猪、松鼠、水獭、狐狸和白面兽等，每年兽皮可出产数万张。并且在山岭中，还有辽阔的牧区。只因国民党统治时期，这个山区，遭到严重破坏，山脚下的农民，多被屠杀，或被赶跑；许多村庄，亦被烧毁。使整个富饶的万宝山，成为人烟稀少，田园荒芜，野兽成群，满目凄凉。宝山来了采宝人
    1957年11月，先有五百六十八名下放干部，到达此山，披荆斩棘，建立起大茅山综合垦殖场。刻苦经营，逐渐扩展。原有山区出外求生的农民，看到本山情形变好，纷纷回乡；更有转业军人加入，所以组织不断壮大。直到现在，全场工作人员及其家属等，共有三万五千四百零六人。除总场外，又有九个分场。深山僻谷，顿然兴盛起来。
    他们经营山区的方法，首先是利用山上原有很茂盛的植物，来进行生产。马尾松是该山最多的，储量达三百多万立方米。他们即把最茂密的松林，予以间伐，或整枝，制成木板，枕木，或坑木，大量供应国家需要。松枝松叶和枯松等，都能加以综合利用，进行做柴，烧炭；或制取松脂、松节油、芳香油；或干溜人造汽油、柴油、选矿油、润滑油、机油、锭子油和沥青等。竹子也是这个山区中很多的，他们也适当地予以间伐，运下山来，供城市需要。同时，更进行清山育林的工作，把杂柴和芭茅等，都全予砍清而保留经济价值更高的树种。所砍下的杂木，也都能作综合利用。山中到处都有野生杨梅，一般年景，可出产二百多万斤，向来都是自然落地腐烂的。现在该场利用来做酒。1959年，采到杨梅十七万斤，酿成香甜美酒一百八十吨。1960年，预计可采五十三万斤，能制美酒四百吨。山中还有野生的梨、枣、苹果、葡萄、李、梅、桃、洋桃、樱桃、橄榄、山楂和草莓等。他们或利用来制酒，或制成各种果干、果脯、果酱和果汁等以出售。还有不少的野葛，他们就挖取它的根部来制酒精。凡是有淀粉或糖分的植物，他们都设法利用来制淀粉或做酒。现在山中，到处都有酒厂，酒的种类很多。山上遍生芭茅，他们利用来造纸。山中多石蒜，向来是人所认为全无用处的东西，他们取来蒸溜丙酮、丁醇和乙醇，得到高价的化工产品。林中湿润，宜于培养食用菌，他们利用来种植香菇、草菇、木耳和各种可食的菌类。那里的药材也很多，有甘草、大黄、桂皮和青果。此外，如红花、木瓜、石木耳、草乌、射干、石菖蒲、野菊、蝉蜕、瓜蒌、五倍子、桐厚朴等，不下百种。他们也在着手研究利用。另外还有栓皮栎十万多株，大红花油茶亦颇多，都是很有经济价值的树木。现正严密保护，并设法繁殖。总之，凡是可以利用的植物，他们都在进一步调查研究，设法予以利用。这两年来，已造林十二万亩，抚育山林四万四千多亩。并开出荒地五千多亩，培育苗木，或种作物。
    关于矿物资源的利用，现在已搞炼铁，并用硫磺制杀虫药和硫酸。其他矿藏，将计划开发利用。多种经营，样样繁荣
    关于水力资源，该场除直接利用各山涧中的水流供应各锯木厂，粮食和饲料等加工厂作动力外，并建设了山中小型水库，以供耕地灌溉。水库和小山塘中都养了鱼，今年计划养鱼一百万尾。水面上又放养了鹅鸭。较大的水库，已建成一千一百瓩的水电站一座和小型发电站八个，保证场中工业用电和照明之用。现在该场各处都有电灯，深山僻谷，大放光明。
    关于动物资源，山中兽类，目前尚未能充分利用。但现在已在山地养猪二万九千余头，家禽十万多只，牛三百余头，山羊一千五百只，细毛羊四百只，兔子二千多头，蜜蜂三百五十群。
    在这两年中，该场利用上述资源，大办小型工厂，已经建成酿酒厂、松香厂、枯松干溜厂、人造石油厂、烤胶厂、机械厂、炼铁厂、砖瓦厂、食品加工厂、食用菌种厂和锯木厂等，共有九十四个，工业产品有一百多种。
    关于交通方面，现在已建成公路五条，长达一百八十公里，主要山地，都可直通汽车。此外，还修造了林道二百多公里。更修浚了山区小河流一百七十五公里，以便行驶小筏，或流放竹木。但是山区很大，资源丰富，有许多已砍伐的竹木，堆积山中，不能及时运出，而城市中，又极需要这些物资。山区交通问题，必须进一步帮助解决。
    在这个综合垦殖场内，还设立了一个共产主义劳动大学分校，共有男女学生一千零六名，分为农学和林学两系。四年制：第一学年，有六个月劳动，五个月学习，一个月休息；第二个学年，有五个月劳动，六个月学习，一个月休息；第三、四学年，为四个月劳动，七个月学习，一个月休息。他们做什么劳动，就学习什么功课，密切结合实际。各人以劳动所得，每月各有十七元的收入，自给有余。这些学生，90％以上，都是工农子弟，过去少有上学的机会，所以求学的愿望迫切，非常用功，进步很快。总校设于南昌郊区，各垦殖场，都有它的分校。这种学校的创办，既不需要国家经费，又可使人有受专门教育的机会，帮助教育普及，确是一种新型的无产阶级学校。此外，场中还设了一个科学研究所。
    场中自建房屋很多，有红专大学、电影院、医院、小学、托儿所、公共食堂等，大家生活都过得很好。起初上山，有的干部不安心，现在他们一辈子在山上工作也愿意了。以前轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的少数干部，现在都能密切和群众在一起而很愉快地工作。所以当地一般人都承认这个山区“人变，山变，风气变，思想生产双丰收”。
    这个垦殖场，做了工作很不少，人多以为江西省人委必定是投下了大量的资金。其实，只在1957年，由省人委拨付了四十万元，作为开办费用，以后就没有再投资了。并且在1958年，该场生产收入，即达三百七十五万元；1959年的收入，为一千一百多万元；1960年，更要争取达到三千万元的收入。这真是在大跃进中，做到“多快好省”。
    各位代表，情况只是介绍到这里。由这些事实，不难说明：发展山区，前途无量，大有可为。我们应当重视山区，多去了解山区，设
　法利用山区，大力向山区进军！这些意见，是否有当？请予指正。最后，敬祝各位代表健康！
