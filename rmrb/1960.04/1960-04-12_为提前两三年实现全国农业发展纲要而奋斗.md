Strive to Fulfill the National Agricultural Development Program Two or Three Years Ahead of Schedule

The National Program for Agricultural Development from 1956 to 1967, passed by the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, is published today. The National People's Congress calls on people of all nationalities throughout the country, and all sectors including industry, agriculture, transportation, finance, trade, science, education, culture, health, and sports, to work together to strive to fulfill the great task of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule.

The National Program for Agricultural Development from 1956 to 1967 was proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong and has been in effect for four years. In these four years, the National Agricultural Development Program has played a great role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people throughout the country and accelerating the development of agricultural production and even the entire socialist construction. Especially since 1958, great changes have taken place in China's agriculture and the vast countryside. Agricultural production has seen two consecutive years of great leaps forward. The people's commune system has been universally implemented in the vast countryside. China's agricultural production and rural socialist construction have entered a new historical period.

The National Agricultural Development Program is a great program for the high-speed development of China's socialist agricultural production and the construction of a new socialist countryside. This program stipulates the requirements for greatly improving the development and production of various agricultural economic sectors, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, within a short period of time, as well as the specific measures to achieve these requirements. It also formulates plans for developing rural culture, education, health, and other aspects based on the development of production, thereby pointing out the great goal of completely changing the face of China's countryside to the people of the whole country. China is a large agricultural country. Agriculture is the foundation of China's national economic development. The high-speed development of agriculture can promote the more rapid leap forward of China's entire socialist construction and can build China into a modern, great socialist country more quickly. Therefore, conscientiously implementing the National Agricultural Development Program and realizing the various tasks in the program ahead of schedule is the central link in the high-speed and proportionate development of China's socialist economic construction.

The facts since 1956, especially since 1958, prove that it is entirely possible to realize the various indicators stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. In fact, many places across the country have already achieved the grain, cotton, and other targets stipulated in the program ahead of schedule. In 1956, 33 counties in China completed the per-mu yield targets for grain as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program; in 1957, 66 counties completed the grain production targets, and 64 counties completed the per-mu yield targets for cotton. By 1959, the number of counties completing the per-mu yield targets for grain had increased to 504, accounting for 28% of the country's counties (cities); the number of counties completing the per-mu yield targets for cotton had increased to 204, accounting for 20% of the country's cotton-growing counties (cities). These counties that realized the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight, ten, or even eleven years ahead of schedule are not all regions with particularly good natural conditions. For example, the mountain counties near the foot of the Great Wall with a relatively cold climate, such as Zunhua, Funing, Luanxian, and Lulong counties in Hebei Province, and Zhangye and Linze counties in Gansu Province, completed the grain targets stipulated in the program as early as 1957. This gives us reason to believe that since these areas with poor natural conditions can realize the indicators stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight, ten, or eleven years ahead of schedule, those areas with the same or better conditions can certainly realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule through hard work. In other aspects, such as comprehensively developing agricultural production, developing rural culture and education, scientific health, and improving people's lives, great achievements have also been made in the past four years. The development of actual life has surpassed the content of the program in developing rural industries, protecting women and children, and implementing the "five guarantees" system. Some requirements of the program, such as catching up with or exceeding the average income level of well-to-do middle peasants before cooperativization, developing rural science, education, culture, and health, have been basically realized or realized in most areas. This is a great victory. This is a reliable foundation for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

It should be pointed out that completing the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule is an arduous task. At present, more than 70% of the counties (cities) in the country have not yet reached the grain production targets stipulated in the program. According to the level required by the program, the total grain output of the country still needs to increase by more than one-third on the basis of 1959. In terms of agricultural production increase measures, especially in terms of mechanization and water conservancy, and in terms of rural culture, education, and health, long-term and great efforts are still needed. Therefore, the people of the whole country should be determined to fight for a few more years and complete this glorious task with the spirit of continuous revolution.

Of great significance for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule is that the whole country should strengthen its support for agriculture, especially its support for the technological transformation of agriculture. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, industrial support for agriculture has been greatly strengthened. In 1959, the state's supply of tractors, tractor-drawn farm implements, and irrigation and drainage machinery to agriculture all increased significantly. Among them, the number of tractors increased by 29.2% on the basis of 1958, the number of tractor-drawn plows increased by 57%, the number of tractor-drawn harrows increased by 114%, and the horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery increased by 112.2%. This year, the steel allocated by the state for the manufacture of agricultural machinery and tools will reach 1.1 million tons, an increase of about 100% over last year. In 1960, the agricultural sector will increase its mechanical power by more than 5 million horsepower, and the area of ​​mechanized farming will reach more than 100 million mu; the area of ​​mechanized irrigation and drainage will reach more than 200 million mu. These are all very necessary. However, in order to develop agriculture at high speed, to realize the technological transformation of agriculture, and to build a new socialist countryside, not only the industrial sector, but also all sectors, including transportation, finance, trade, science, education, culture, health, and sports, need to provide strong support. The Party Central Committee has already proposed that agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and a considerable degree of electrification should be basically realized throughout the country in the next ten years or so. This is not only a great task for the members of the rural people's communes, but also a great task for the entire party and the entire people.

In order to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, it is necessary to further take grain as the key link, make overall arrangements for grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, and achieve comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This is the policy of our party for developing agriculture. It should be particularly pointed out that in the specific measures of agricultural production, the "Eight-Character Charter" must be implemented. Since the Great Leap Forward, in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" in various places, whether it is deep plowing and soil improvement, water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, or selection of fine seeds and close planting, not only have extremely great achievements been made, but also more and more experience has been gained. The movement to promote the "Eight-Character Charter" is a technical innovation and technical revolution movement in agricultural cultivation technology. The facts since the Great Leap Forward have proved that wherever the "Eight-Character Charter" can be implemented in accordance with local conditions, agricultural production there can develop faster; wherever the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture is implemented more comprehensively and systematically, agricultural production there will develop faster and better. In the process of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in the current year, it should be further linked with long-term farmland capital construction and the realization of garden-style farming. Garden-style farming is a concentrated expression of the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture and an important development of the Eight-Character Charter in practical application. According to incomplete statistics from various places, high-yield fields and demonstration plots that are developing towards garden-style farming with high standards account for about 20% of all cultivated land. These high-yield fields should not only increase the production of more grain, cotton, and other agricultural products, but more importantly, make them a lever for driving general fields to rapidly increase yields and realize garden-style farming. We should fully utilize the increasingly rich experience of the "Eight-Character Charter" to make high-yield areas and high-yield crops even higher-yielding, and to turn low-yield areas and low-yield crops into high-yield ones, so as to comprehensively and ahead of schedule complete the various indicators stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program.

Further consolidating and developing the rural people's communes is the most important guarantee for completing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that the people's commune has a large organizational scale, a high degree of collectivization, a combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and a unity of government and commune. Therefore, in liberating rural productive forces and promoting the rapid development of agricultural production and the entire rural socialist construction, it has stronger vitality and unparalleled superiority than agricultural cooperatives. The people's commune can more effectively fully mobilize and rationally use rural manpower, materials, and financial resources than advanced cooperatives, and undertake production and construction undertakings that agricultural cooperatives are unable to undertake; it can uniformly arrange production and distribution within the entire commune, run collective welfare undertakings, and thoroughly liberate the vast number of women; it can more effectively organize members' political, cultural, and technical studies. In the past two years, the development speed of China's agricultural production and rural industry has been greatly accelerated, and the development speed of farmland water conservancy, rural transportation construction, and cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings has also been greatly accelerated. The socialist consciousness of farmers throughout the country has also been significantly improved. In the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward, China's total agricultural output value increased by more than 45% compared to 1957, total grain output increased by 46%, total cotton output increased by 47%, and other crops and agricultural economic sectors such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also increased to varying degrees. The growth rate of total agricultural output value, grain, and cotton is five to six times faster than the growth rate in the first two years after the National Agricultural Development Program was announced. Further giving play to the superiority of the people's communes and carrying out unremitting struggles in all aspects will surely be able to continue to maintain the leap-forward speed of agricultural production and construction.

The situation on the agricultural front is as good as on other fronts across the country. Thanks to the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the conditions for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule are very good. Of course, it should also be seen that comprehensively completing the various tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule is still an arduous and great struggle. The road we have to travel is still long, and some difficulties of this or that kind will still occur on our road forward, but as the National Agricultural Development Program pointed out: "It all depends on human effort. For our liberated people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Not fearing difficulties is the original great character of our working people." We believe that with the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as long as all the peasants continue to work hard, coupled with the strong support of the whole country, we will certainly be able to realize the great and glorious tasks put forward by the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule.

    为提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗
    第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要今天公布了。全国人民代表大会号召全国各族人民，工业、农业、交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等一切部门共同努力为提前两年或者三年实现全国农业发展纲要这个伟大的任务而奋斗。
    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要，是中共中央根据毛泽东同志的倡议提出的，从公布到现在已经四年了。在这四年中，全国农业发展纲要对于动员全国人民的积极性，对于加速农业生产以至整个社会主义建设事业的发展，起了伟大的作用，特别是从1958年以来，我国农业和广大农村发生了极大的变化。农业生产出现了连续两年大跃进的局面。广大农村普遍实现了人民公社化。我国农业生产和农村社会主义建设已进入一个新的历史时期。
    全国农业发展纲要是高速度发展我国社会主义农业生产和建设社会主义新农村的伟大纲领。这个纲领规定在不很长的时间内大大提高我国农、林、牧、副、渔各个农业经济部门发展生产的要求和实现这些要求的具体措施，也制定在发展生产基础上开展农村文化、教育、卫生等各方面的规划，从而向全国人民指出了彻底改变我国农村面貌的伟大目标。我国是一个农业大国。农业是我国国民经济发展的基础。农业的高速度发展，可以促进我国整个社会主义建设更迅速地向前跃进，可以更快地把我国建成一个现代化的伟大的社会主义国家。因此，认真执行全国农业发展纲要，提前实现纲要上的各项任务，是我国社会主义经济建设高速度、按比例地发展的中心环节。
    1956年、特别是1958年以来的事实证明，提前实现全国农业发展纲要规定的各项指标是完全可能的。事实上，全国有不少的地方已经提前实现了纲要上规定的粮、棉等指标。1956年，我国有三十三个县完成了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产指标；1957年有六十六个县完成了粮食生产指标，有六十四个县完成了棉花亩产的指标。到1959年完成粮食亩产指标的已增加到五百零四个县，即占全国县（市）的28％；完成棉花亩产指标的已增加到二百零四个县，即占全国植棉县（市）的20％。这些提前八年、十年以至十一年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的粮棉增产指标的县份，并不都是自然条件特别好的地区，比如靠近长城脚下，气候较寒冷的山区县——河北省遵化、抚宁、滦县、卢龙等县，甘肃省的张掖、临泽等县，都是在1957年就完成了纲要规定的粮食指标。这就使我们有根据相信，既然这些自然条件不好的地区，能够提前八年、十年、十一年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的指标，那些具有同样条件的地区、或者条件更好的地区，经过努力，当然也能够提前实现全国农业发展纲要的。在其他方面，在全面发展农业生产、开展农村文化教育、科学卫生以及改善人民生活方面，四年来同样获得了巨大的成绩。实际生活的发展，在发展农村工业、保护妇女儿童、实行五保等方面，已经超过了纲要的内容。纲要的有些要求，如赶上或超过合作化以前富裕中农的平均收入水平，发展农村科学、教育、文化、卫生事业等等方面，已经基本实现或者在大部地区实现了。这是一个伟大的胜利。这是提前实现全国农业发展纲要的可靠的基础。
    应当指出，提前两三年完成全国农业发展纲要是一个艰巨的任务。现在，全国还有70％以上的县（市）还没有达到纲要规定的粮食生产指标。全国粮食总产量，按照纲要所要求的水平计算，还要在1959年的基础上增加三分之一以上。在农业的增产措施方面，特别是在机械化、水利化等方面，在农村文教、卫生等事业方面，还需要作长期的巨大的努力。因此，全国人民应当下定决心，再奋战几年，以不断革命的精神完成这个光荣的任务。
    对于提前实现全国农业发展纲要有重大意义的，就是全国加强对农业的支援，特别是对农业技术改造的支援。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，工业对农业的支援已经大大加强。1959年，国家供应农业的拖拉机、机引农具和排灌机械都有了很大的增长，其中拖拉机台数在1958年的基础上增长29.2％，机引犁增长57％，机引耙增长114％，排灌机械的马力增长112.2％。今年，由国家分配的用于制造农业机械和农具的钢材将达一百一十万吨，比去年又增长一倍左右。1960年农业方面将增加机械动力五百多万马力，机耕面积将达一亿亩以上；机械排灌面积将达两亿亩以上。这些都是十分必需的。但是，为了高速度发展农业，为了实现对农业的技术改造，为了建设社会主义的新农村，不仅需要工业部门，而且需要交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等一切部门的大力支援。党中央已经提出要在今后十年左右的时间内在全国范围内基本实现农业机械化、水利化和相当程度的电气化。这不单是农村人民公社社员的伟大任务，同时也是全党全民的伟大任务。
    为了提前实现全国农业发展纲要，必须进一步以粮为纲，对粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各种农作物进行全面安排，并且做到农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展。这是我们党发展农业的方针。特别应当指出的是，在农业生产的具体措施中，必须贯彻执行“八字宪法”。大跃进以来，各地在贯彻执行“八字宪法”中，无论是深耕改良土壤，还是水利建设和积肥造肥，或者选育良种、密植等等方面，不仅已经获得了十分巨大的成绩，而且经验越来越多。推行“八字宪法”的运动，就是农业耕作技术上的技术革新和技术革命运动。大跃进以来的事实证明，那里能够因地制宜地贯彻执行“八字宪法”，那里的农业生产就能够更快的发展；那里贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”越全面越系统，那里的农业生产就发展得越快越好。在贯彻执行“八字宪法”、争取当年农业大丰收的过程中，应当进一步同长远农田基本建设、实现园田化联系起来。园田化是农业“八字宪法”的集中表现，也是八字宪法在实际运用中的一个重要发展。根据各地不完全的统计，向园田化高标准发展的丰产方、指挥田等，已经占到全部耕地20％左右。应当使这些丰产方不仅增产更多的粮食、棉花和其他农产品，更重要的是使它们成为带动一般田迅速提高产量和实现园田化的杠杆。我们应当充分运用“八字宪法”的日益丰富的经验，使高产地区高产作物更加高产，使低产地区低产作物变为高产，以便全面地提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的各项指标。
    进一步巩固和发展农村人民公社，是提前完成全国农业发展纲要的最重要的保证。两年来的事实已经完全证明，人民公社组织规模大，集体化程度高，工农商学兵互相结合，农林牧副渔全面发展，政社合一，因而在解放农村生产力，促进农业生产和整个农村社会主义建设迅速发展方面，具有比农业社更强大的生命力和无比的优越性。人民公社能够比高级社更有效地充分动员和合理使用农村的人力、物力和财力，举办农业社无力举办的生产建设事业；能够在全公社范围内统一安排生产和分配，兴办集体福利事业，彻底解放广大妇女；能够更有效地组织社员的政治学习、文化学习和技术学习。两年来，我国的农业生产和农村工业的发展速度大大加快了，农田水利、农村的交通运输建设和文化、教育、科学、卫生事业的发展速度也大大加快了，全国农民的社会主义觉悟也有了显著的提高。在连续两年的大跃进中，我国的农业总产值比1957年增长了45％以上，粮食总产量增长了46％，棉花总产量增长了47％，其他作物和林、牧、副、渔各个农业经济部门都有了不同程度的增长。农业总产值、粮食和棉花的增长速度，比全国农业发展纲要公布后的最初两年的增长速度，都分别加快了五倍到六倍。进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，从各方面进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够继续保持农业生产和建设的跃进速度。
    现在农业战线的形势同全国其他战线一样是极其良好的。由于两年的大跃进，提前实现全国农业发展纲要的条件是很好的。当然，也应当看到，全面地提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的各项任务，仍然是一个艰巨的伟大的斗争。我们要走的路还是长的，在我们前进的道路上仍然会发生一些这样或那样的困难，但是，正如全国农业发展纲要上所指出的：“事在人为。对于我们解放了的人民来说，没有什么困难不能克服。不怕困难，是我们劳动人民本来的伟大性格。”我们相信，有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，只要全体农民继续努力，再加上全国的大力支援，我们一定能够提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要提出的伟大光荣的任务。
