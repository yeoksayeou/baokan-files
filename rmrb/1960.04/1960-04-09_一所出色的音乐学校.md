　　In Czechoslovakia, children have the opportunity to receive music education from childhood, because almost all cities, large and small, and villages in Czechoslovakia have primary music schools.

　　Prague alone has about twenty primary music schools. The primary music school in Prague's second district is an excellent school. This school employs music experts as teachers, who use advanced teaching methods to nurture more than five hundred children aged six to fourteen.

　　Whenever a new school year is about to begin, the teachers personally visit the primary classes of the eight-year schools in their district to select students with musical talent. After obtaining the consent of the students' parents, the selected students enter the preparatory class of the music school. The teachers use various interesting methods to gradually familiarize the students with musical scores, gradually enable them to recognize various musical instruments, and develop their singing talents. Students studying at this music school will begin practicing musical instruments from the age of ten to twelve. At the same time, they are taught music theory. Students studying piano also need to take choir and piano accompaniment classes. Students studying violin, in addition to general courses, also participate in band practice.

　　The music school teachers conduct teaching work according to the different conditions of each student. In addition to understanding the characteristics and comprehension of each student, the teachers also guide students to develop a strong interest in the courses they are learning.

　　The music school does not cultivate "child prodigies," but simply cultivates students' love of music in general. Graduates of the music school have good conditions for continuing their studies at music academies or other higher music schools. If graduates do not plan to become professional musicians, they can choose other jobs and engage in music activities in their spare time.

    一所出色的音乐学校
    捷克斯洛伐克的儿童们从童年起就有接受音乐教育的可能，因为捷克斯洛伐克各大、小城市和乡村几乎都设有初级音乐学校。
    仅布拉格就设有约二十所初级音乐学校。布拉格第二区的初级音乐学校是一所办得出色的音乐学校。这所学校由音乐专家担任教学工作，他们用先进教学法培育着五百多个从六岁到十四岁的儿童。
    每当新学年将开始的时候，教员们就亲自到所属区的八年制学校的初级班去访问，以便挑选一些具有音乐天才的学生。在征得学生们的家长的同意后，被挑选的学生就进入音乐学校的预备班学习。教师们用各种有趣的方式使学生们逐步熟悉乐谱，并逐步使学生们识别各种乐器和发挥他们在歌唱方面的才能。在这所音乐学校学习的学生，将从十至十二岁起开始练习吹奏乐器。同时，还给学生们讲授音乐理论。学习钢琴的学生，还需要上合唱课和钢琴伴奏课等。学习提琴的学生除一般课程外，还要参加乐队演奏练习。
    音乐学校的教员根据每个学生不同的条件进行教学工作，教师们除了要了解每个学生的特点和理解力外，还要引导学生对所学的课程发生浓厚的兴趣。
    音乐学校并不培养“神童”，而只是一般地培养学生们对音乐的爱好。音乐学校的毕业生都具有进入音乐学院或其他高等音乐学校继续深造的良好条件。毕业生如果不打算成为职业音乐家，他们可以选择其他工作，在业余从事音乐活动。
