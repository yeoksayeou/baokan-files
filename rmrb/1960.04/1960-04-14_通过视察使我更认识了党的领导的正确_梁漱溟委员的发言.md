Fellow Chairman and Committee Members:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee"; I wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 Draft National Budget." Now, regarding Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, I would like to say a few words based on what I have seen during my recent inspection tour to places outside Beijing before this conference. My original intention in going to Shandong this time was to look at the management of the people's communes, but I unexpectedly saw the surprising rise of local industries, which made many of the words in the first paragraph of Vice Premier Li's report accurately confirmed by the facts before my eyes.

Yuncheng County in southwestern Shandong is a place I visited in the past, and it can be considered remote, backward, and poor. Before liberation, there was no industry to speak of. But now, the county has eighteen factories, including power plants, machinery factories, chemical factories, wineries, paper mills, printing factories, etc. Things like electric motors, diesel engines, certain lathes, artificial rubber tires, and steel wheel rims have all been successfully trial-produced and will soon be produced in batches. When I heard the county head talk about their plans to produce new agricultural tools, implements, and transportation equipment (double-share plows, seeders, harvesters, threshers, powered water pumps, crushers, waterwheels, rubber-tired carts, etc.) in certain quantities this year, the variety was numerous and the numbers were not small (hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands), I couldn't help but be surprised at how this small place could have such productivity and was a little incredulous. However, after visiting and researching, I suddenly understood: the truth is just like that.

What did I see? And what did I understand? I saw that all employees—from cadres to workers (from master craftsmen to young apprentices) to technicians—were using their brains and were full of energy. I saw how they overcame difficulties under the lack of conditions in the past, making this industry grow from nothing to something, from small to large, and how lively and moving the scene before my eyes is now. I understood the old saying "Man proposes, God disposes," but the people's production enthusiasm and creativity were cleverly mobilized by the Party and Chairman Mao. I understood that such things and such scenes are not only seen in Beijing, Shanghai, the Northeast... those big places, but are originally already popularized in all places and corners of the country.

In this way, the following words in the first paragraph of Vice Premier Li's report:

"The people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. The people, liberated from the old society, become masters under the socialist system, and can fully exert their initiative and creativity, so that production and construction can achieve high-speed development."

(See page 4 of the original report)

Isn't this confirmed by the facts!

This is just a general statement, just a statement from the basics. If we go into detail to explain why this miracle (Yuncheng's, the nation's) appeared, we can analyze and point out at least three points as follows:

1.  Breaking down all kinds of superstitions, daring to think and act;
2.  "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations";
3.  Decentralization of the system, decentralization of power.

Due to point one, ordinary workers and even young apprentices who lack culture also use their brains and contribute a bit of creativity. Due to point two, cadres, workers, and technicians are no longer working separately but are meeting and connecting with each other. When they jointly attack a problem, they are invincible and achieve miraculous results. Due to point three, the enterprises originally managed by central departments are decentralized to provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and the enterprises originally managed by provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are decentralized to special districts or counties. A small county or small corner is no longer restricted in its enthusiasm and creativity due to matters not being under its jurisdiction, and its spirit is greatly encouraged and enlivened, and things are done.

I think the surprising rise of local industries in various places must rely on these three points, which are indispensable. And these three points are under the leadership of the Party, which everyone has become familiar with in recent years, and are also emphasized in Vice Premier Li's report (see pages five and six of the report). Then, isn't the correctness and brilliance of these principles and policies confirmed by the facts in Yuncheng!

The first paragraph of Vice Premier Li's report is about the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, and his second paragraph is about how we will continue to leap forward this year. Regarding his second paragraph, I combine it with the facts I have seen above, and naturally I can have confidence and be very optimistic.

In his second paragraph, he pointed out that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and has an extremely important role in the overall economic development. When it comes to agricultural issues, he pointed out that after experiencing the land reform stage and the cooperativization stage, we are now entering a new stage. This is the agricultural mechanization stage. In other words: industrial actively supporting agriculture and promoting agricultural mechanization is this year's task and even the task for the next few years (the above is detailed on page twelve of the original report). If I had not seen the example of Yuncheng and did not know that local industries in various parts of the country had risen surprisingly, I would not know where the guarantee for completing this task lies. After seeing the Yuncheng example and then reading the second paragraph of this report, recalling the Yuncheng county head's statement that this year they would mass-produce various new agricultural tools, I suddenly understood: it turns out that Yuncheng and they are doing just that! Vice Premier Li's formulation of the 1960 National Economic Plan was originally with a clear understanding of the overall situation! How can I not have confidence in the future of agricultural mechanization?

Speaking of this, it must also be pointed out that in the autumn of 1958, the Party's call for "all the people to make steel" was very reasonable. At that time, I was visiting various places in Anhui and saw that "small indigenous furnaces" were everywhere, which was really lively. However, I was thinking in my heart: is it a waste to invest a large amount of labor into this? Is it a pity to cut down almost all the trees on the mountains to burn charcoal? It would be better to pick more places and do it well, why do it so universally? It was not until I saw the surprising rise of local industries in Yuncheng that I suddenly realized. Manufacturing machinery relies entirely on steel as raw material. The rise of local industries and the future of agricultural mechanization are impossible without steel. The success of one thing must have both the "human" factor and the "material" factor. If it were not for the mass steelmaking by all the people in the first place, so that we have steel everywhere today, the plan mentioned by the Yuncheng county head this year to build tens of thousands of new agricultural tools would not be so readily available in terms of raw materials. Because Yuncheng does not produce iron, does not produce coal, and even lacks mountains and forests. However, due to the mass steelmaking that year, a large number of laborers in this county also went out to do it, and at the same time, its neighbor Liangshan County has also become a small steel base. In this way, since they have touched steel and are not unfamiliar with it, and it can be obtained nearby, all plans are not difficult to implement. "It is not high to see one step in chess," the leadership is precisely seeing things clearly a few steps ahead, and we must wait until afterwards to understand.

The above is based on Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report combined with what I saw during my inspection tour outside Beijing, explaining how I realized the correctness of the Party's leadership. I hope that comrades will correct me if what I said is appropriate.

### 通过视察使我更认识了党的领导的正确  梁漱溟委员的发言

专栏：

    通过视察使我更认识了党的领导的正确
    梁漱溟委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席的“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国常务委员会工作报告”；衷心拥护李富春副总理的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。现在我对于李富春副总理的报告，结合着最近在此次大会前出京视察之所见，略说几句话。我此次出去到山东，原意在看人民公社的经营管理方面，却无意中看到了地方工业有惊人的兴起，使我对于李副总理报告内第一段的许多话，从眼前事实恰好得到印证。
    鲁西南的郓城县是我旧日曾经到过的地方，大致要算偏僻、闭塞、贫苦的，解放前一向没有工业可言。但现在居然县办有十八个工厂，其中有电力厂、机械厂、化工厂、酒厂、纸厂、印刷厂等等。就类如电动机、柴油机、某些车床、人造橡胶轮带、车轮钢圈这些东西均已先后试制成功，即将成批生产。当我听到县长同志谈说他们今年计划要生产新农具、工具、运输具（双铧犁、播种机、收割机、脱粒机、动力抽水机、粉碎机、水车、胶轮车等）某种多少，某种多少，种色既多，数字又不小（几百、几千、几万），不禁惊讶这个小地方何以有此生产力真有点信不及。然而一经参观访问，自己却又恍然明白过来：事理原自如此。
    我看到了什么？又明白了什么？我看到了一切职工——从干部到工人（从老师傅到小徒工）到技术员，人人开动脑筋，干劲十足；看到了他们在过去条件缺乏之下怎样克服困难，使得这工业从无到有，从小到大，而现在眼前的景象又怎样活泼动人。我明白了“事在人为”那句老话，而人们的生产积极性创造性却被党和毛主席巧妙地调动起来；我明白了像这样事情这样景象不止见于北京、上海、东北……那些大地方，而原来是已经普及于全国各地方、各角落了。
    这样，我对于李副总理报告内第一段如下的话：
    人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。人民群众从旧社会解放出来，在社会主义制度下成为主人，就能够充分发挥积极性和创造性，使生产建设得到高速度的发展。
  （见原报告第4页）
    岂非得到了事实印证！
    这还只是一则浑括的话，还只是从基本上讲的话。若细去讲明这奇迹（郓城的、全国的）之所以出现，又可以分析指出至少有三点如下：
    一、是破除各色各样的迷信，敢想敢作；
    二、是“两参一改三结合”；
    三、是体制下放，权力下放。
    由于一点，所以缺乏文化的一般工人乃至小徒工亦开动脑筋，贡献出了一分创造力。由于二点，而后干部、工人、技术员方才不是各干各的而彼此碰头、互相接通了气；当其合力向一个问题进攻时，就无坚不摧，收到了奇效。由于三点，原来是中央部门管理的企业下放给省、市、自治区，原来是省、市、自治区管理的企业又下放给专区或县管理，而后一个小县份、小角落乃不因事权不属，牵制了其积极性、创造性，而精神大大鼓舞起来、活跃起来，事情亦就办起来。
    我想各地方工业之有惊人的兴起，至少是要靠这三点，不可或缺。而这三点原是在党的领导下，大家近年所熟知的，亦是李副总理报告中一一着重指出的（分见于报告第五页、第六页）。那么，这些方针政策的正确和高明，岂非又从郓城的事实得到了印证吗！
    李副总理报告的第一段是在讲过去两年来的大跃进，而其第二段话则是讲今年我们将如何继续地跃进。对于他这第二段话，我结合着上述所见的事实来想，自然又可以具有信心，甚为乐观。
    他的第二段话内，指出农业是国民经济的基础，对于经济全面发展有着极端重要的作用。而说到农业问题呢，他指出我们在经历了土地改革阶段和合作化阶段之后的今天，正须进入一个新阶段。这就是农业机械化阶段。换句话说：工业积极支援农业，促使农业机械化是今年的任务乃至今后几年的任务（以上具见原报告第十二页）。假如我不曾见到郓城的事例，不知道全国各地方工业有了惊人的兴起，那我将不晓得这任务完成的保证何在。而在见到郓城事例后，再来读这报告的第二段话，回想起郓城县长所说今年要大量生产各种新农具的那些计划，我顿然明白：原来郓城他们正是在这样作啊！李副总理之制定1960年国民经济计划，原来是对于全局早已心中有数啊！我对农业机械化的前途怎么不具有信心呢。
    说到此，还必须指出1958年秋天，党号召“全民大炼钢铁”是大有道理的。那时候我正在安徽各地参观，见到遍处“小土群”真是热闹。然而我心中却在想：把大量又大量的劳动力都投入到这上面来是否浪费？把山上林木几乎砍伐一光来烧炭，岂不可惜？尽多多拣地方搞好了，何必这样普遍地搞？直到在郓城看见地方工业惊人兴起的时候，我方才恍然大悟。制造机械全靠钢铁为原料。地方工业的兴起，农业机械化的前途，没有钢铁是不行的。一事之成既一面要有“人”的因素，还少不得要有“物”的因素一面。假如当初不是全民大炼钢铁，让我们今天遍处有了钢铁，像郓城县长所说今年要大造新农具几万件的计划，在原料上怕就不那么现成凑手。因为郓城这地方不出铁，不出煤，乃至亦缺少山林。然而由于那年大炼钢铁，这县里亦有大批劳动力出去搞过一番，同时它的近邻梁山县亦已变成一个小钢铁基地。这样，对于钢铁既然摸过而不生疏，又就近可取，一切计划就不难办到了。“棋看一步不为高”，领导上正是抢先几步把事情看清楚的，而我们必待事后才明白。
    以上就李富春副总理的报告结合我出京视察所见，说出我如何认识了党的领导之正确。所说是否有当，还望同志们指教。
