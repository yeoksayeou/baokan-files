Yu Kaiquan, Mao Henian, Xu Shigao, Qin Xiudian, Yang Dingan, Bao Guobao representing the joint speech of Sun Baoji and Huang Yuxian.
Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow committee members:
We completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. Now, we would like to offer some opinions on the work of the power industry for your consideration.

	Great Leap Forward in the Power Industry, Outstanding Achievements in Scientific and Technological Research
In 1959, China's power industry achieved an even greater leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Over the past decade since liberation, the average annual growth rate of electricity generation has been 25.4%, far exceeding the development speed of capitalist countries. The annual growth rate of electricity generation in 1958 was 42%, and the annual growth rate in 1959 was 51%, which is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. In 1959, electricity generation reached 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, and China's position in the world in terms of production level jumped from 25th in 1949 to 9th.
During the First Five-Year Plan, China's power generating equipment capacity increased by a total of 2,469,000 kilowatts, while in 1958 alone, it increased by 1,800,000 kilowatts, and in 1959 it increased by another 3,200,000 kilowatts, exceeding the 1,840,000 kilowatts added by the United Kingdom in the same year by 73.9%. In terms of the scale of annual equipment increase, we have left the United Kingdom far behind.
Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" by promoting both large, medium, and small-scale projects, and both indigenous and foreign methods, China's power industry has launched a massive mass movement and全民办电 (all the people running electricity), which has not only played a huge role in supplying the ever-increasing electricity needs of cities and industrial production, but also opened up new avenues for solving rural electricity consumption and developing rural electrification. At present, thousands upon thousands of small indigenous groups and small foreign groups are blossoming and developing vigorously throughout the country.
Along with the Great Leap Forward in the power industry, there has been a great development in scientific and technological work in the power industry. The main achievements are reflected in the following aspects:
One, in recent years, a large number of hydro and thermal power plants and high-voltage transmission lines and substations have been built, and a large number of modern technical equipment has been put into operation. At present, China is able to independently design and construct hydro and thermal power plants with a capacity of over one million kilowatts, and has mastered the manufacturing, installation, adjustment, operation and maintenance of large-scale hydro turbine generators, large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure thermal equipment, and new automatic and remote-control equipment, fundamentally changing China's backwardness in this regard in the past.
Two, through mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movements, key technical problems have been solved, and major technical innovations such as increasing equipment output, maintaining lines without power outages, increasing line voltage, and cooperating in power supply and consumption have been carried out, achieving more electricity generation, more electricity supply, and ensuring safe and economic operation. In 1959, the average electricity generated per kilowatt of installed equipment was more than 6,000 kilowatt-hours, an increase of one and a half times compared to 2,330 kilowatt-hours in 1949. The average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour in thermal power plants was reduced by nearly half compared to 1949, and more than 4 million tons of low-quality coal were burned.
Three, in terms of infrastructure construction, significant achievements have been made in shortening construction periods, reducing costs, and saving raw materials. The construction periods of hydro power plants, thermal power plants, and transmission lines have been shortened by about half compared to the First Five-Year Plan period, and the costs have also been reduced by about half. For example, large hydro power plants such as the Sanmenxia on the Yellow River and the Xin'an River in Zhejiang will generate electricity ahead of schedule; some hydro power stations have been able to generate electricity by blocking floods in one dry season. During the First Five-Year Plan, the general construction progress of thermal power plants was one year for design, one year for preparation, and one year for construction. At present, most high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plants take no more than one year from the start of construction to the first unit generating electricity; some projects have achieved continuous commissioning of several units in the same year. In the construction of open-air and semi-open-air power plants, several pilot projects have been carried out, and design, construction, and operation experience has been gained, creating conditions for the widespread promotion of this layout in the future.
Four, in order to prepare for the long-term construction of larger-scale hydro and thermal power plants and power grids, the principle of combining the near and far was implemented in scientific research, and both cutting-edge scientific research and solutions to recent engineering and technical problems were carried out. For example, the trial production and adoption of cutting-edge computing tools such as dynamic simulation and electronic analog computers, the design of ultra-high-voltage projects and the research of protection equipment, the automation of power grids, and the research of large-scale hydro turbine generator units have all achieved great success, preparing conditions for the rapid ascent of China's power industry's science and technology to the world's peak.
Five, with the rapid and widespread development of power production and construction, the technical strength of the power industry has also grown rapidly. At present, all provinces and regions have their own design, construction, operation, and scientific research teams, with strong and red and expert young workers and technicians; there are also higher and secondary vocational schools in various places, which, together with production units, adopt a "one-main, two-auxiliary, and three-combination" approach to cultivate new forces. At the same time, with the widespread development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, power scientific knowledge has gradually been mastered and applied by the masses.
Six, in the vigorously developing technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations", mass creativity has sprung up in a very short period of time, and the content is also very rich. The degree of mechanization in coal transportation and ash removal in thermal power plants, the maintenance work of power plants and lines, and the construction of various projects has been continuously improved, and a lot of mechanized tools combining foreign and indigenous methods have been created. In terms of automation, hydro power plants such as Meishan in Anhui have achieved complete automation, with remote control in the central dispatching station; Unit 6 of the Yangshupu Thermal Power Plant in Shanghai has achieved initial success in the trial of self-starting or shutdown, and there are already more than 70 unmanned or home-duty substations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Shanghai power grids.

	Launching Mass Movements is an Important Guarantee of Victory
The tremendous achievements made by the power industry in scientific and technological aspects since the Great Leap Forward powerfully demonstrate that as long as we earnestly implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, firmly rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and launch mass movements and technical revolutions, scientific and technological work, like other work, can continuously achieve great leaps forward. In the past, relying on a few experts to carry out research work in the laboratory in a cold and deserted manner yielded few results, while since the Great Leap Forward, vigorously launching mass movements has solved key technical problems, and some cutting-edge scientific and technological problems have also been solved. In the science and technology of the power industry, any major achievement is the result of implementing the principle of the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and promoting the spirit of communist cooperation. For example, in the past, the maintenance of lines and equipment required a power outage before work could be carried out, but the Anshan Power Supply Bureau implemented the "three-way combination" principle and cooperated with professional research units and production units, successfully creating the experience of maintaining lines without power outages. This experience has been推广 (promoted) throughout the country, and through mass improvement, has been developed to 220,000-volt voltage lines, thus solving the problem of power outages affecting power supply during line maintenance. As another example, magnetic blow-out arresters are still advanced new technologies. China started research on them by a small number of people, and progress was slow, but after mobilizing more than a dozen units, including scientific research, manufacturing, operation, and schools, to jointly conduct research, a trial product was successfully manufactured in a very short period of time.
The reason why scientific and technological achievements in the power industry can develop rapidly is inseparable from the high-speed development of the power industry. For example, in order to solve the problem of insufficient power transmission capacity of power supply lines, the research on voltage increase operation of lines has promoted the scientific research of internal overvoltage of high-voltage lines and their protection equipment, so that China's high-voltage technology has been rapidly improved. As another example, in order to save steel, the design of reinforced concrete poles and the application of reinforced concrete structures in all aspects of the power industry have been developed. In addition to the widespread use of reinforced concrete poles on 110,000-volt lines, reinforced concrete single poles with guy wires have recently been used on 220,000-volt lines. The 220,000-volt line crossing the Yangtze River with a span of 1,722 meters and a tower height of 146.75 meters at both ends also adopts a reinforced concrete structure, creating a precedent for the use of this structure in large-span lines in the world. Recently, the use of large-diameter pressure reinforced concrete water pipes in hydro and thermal power projects has saved a lot of steel plates, which is also a new design that has never been seen before. These examples illustrate the correctness of the Party's policy of using tasks to drive disciplines and serving production and construction through science and technology.
Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the emancipation of the mind and the promotion of the communist style of daring to think and act, many achievements have been made in science and technology. For example, the output of power generating equipment was previously limited to the capacity specified by the manufacturer. However, since the Great Leap Forward, in order to meet the urgent need for electricity for the national economy, power workers have broken down superstitions and, through close cooperation between professional research and experimental units and production sites, conducted detailed calculations, research, experiments, and operational tests on equipment, increasing the output of most power generating equipment by 5% to 30%. The total output increase nationwide reached more than 900,000 kilowatts, which played a significant role in increasing the power supply.
Many scientific and technological achievements are inseparable from learning advanced technologies from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. In the process of learning, power workers have also developed them according to China's specific conditions. For example, in order to solve the problem of using local materials to build dams and construction technology, China learned new methods from the Soviet Union, such as underwater dumping and directional blasting. The underwater dumping dam of the Fenhe Reservoir is as high as 60 meters.
While learning from advanced foreign experience, it is also necessary to implement the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods. For example, the design of the cofferdam of Sanmenxia makes full use of the silting effect of the Yellow River sediment, which is a new achievement. The Weishan project successfully adopted China's traditional closure method and successfully cut off the Yellow River. As another example, in the construction of thermal power plants, two 50-ton cranes successfully hoisted the 170-ton stator of a 100,000-kilowatt generator.
In terms of promoting communist cooperation, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the Shanghai Thermal Power Plant received the support of more than 50 units, including enterprises, administrative units, schools, and troops, so that the first unit of this high-temperature and high-pressure power plant started generating electricity in six months and was completed in its entirety in ten months, creating a record for the rapid construction of thermal power plants. As another example, in the past, the power supply methods for inside and outside factories, between factories, for industrial electricity and residential electricity, and for electric lights and power electricity in factories, all had separate lines and were equipped with separate transformers for power supply. Harbin first created the experience of "four-in-one" ring power supply, which connected various lines together, thereby greatly improving power supply capacity and saving a lot of equipment. This is not only a technical issue, but also a major issue of adapting the mode of production management to the socialist mode of production to promote the development of social productive forces; it is not only a technical experience of reforming the power supply and consumption system, but also an experience of how to fully utilize and give play to the superiority of the socialist system.
The victory of the power industry in scientific and technological work is the victory of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the victory of implementing the Party's general line for building socialism, and the victory of implementing the Party's policy of leading science and technology.

	Launch Technical Innovation and Ascend to Technical Peaks
1960 is a year of continuous great leap forward for all sectors of China's national economy. This is fully reflected in the draft national economic plan. To complete this plan, the production level of the power industry will reach 55.5 to 58 billion kilowatt-hours, and the newly added capacity of power generating equipment will be 4.2 million kilowatts. This is a very encouraging continuous leap forward plan, and it is also an arduous and glorious task for our power industry workers. We firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the three magic weapons of building socialism, the experience of high-speed development of the power industry, and the support of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries; as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, launch mass movements, and carry out technical revolutions in our specific work, our power industry can not only develop at high speed, but also certainly develop continuously at high speed. We have firm confidence to ensure the completion and over-completion of the 1960 power industry plan; and to lay a good foundation for the continuous leap forward of the entire 1960s, strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the shortest possible time, and catch up with the world's advanced level in power science and technology as soon as possible, and climb to the world's peak. To this end, we must also work hard in the following aspects:
One, actively participate in the current vigorously developing mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations", and improve the level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and remote control of power plants, power grids, and construction sites. Achieve the goal of improving labor productivity and enabling the power industry to achieve a higher rate of development.
Two, rapidly master the design, construction, and operation technology of the latest large-scale power generating equipment; actively carry out research experiments and promote new equipment, new structures, new layouts, new varieties of alternative materials, further save materials, reduce costs, and speed up the pace of construction.
Three, in order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, we must follow the proposal of Vice Premier Li in the report, take supporting the technical transformation of agriculture as our important task, actively promote rural electrification, and study electrification planning schemes and power generation and supply technologies that are suitable for the characteristics of rural areas in various places. Cultivate technical talents for rural electrification to accelerate rural electrification.
Four, in order to meet the needs of larger-scale development of the power industry in the future, vigorously carry out scientific research work, implement the principle of combining the near and far, combine the current power construction, cultivate experimental fields in water conservancy, power generation, power transmission, and systems, and promote the rapid ascent of scientific and technological work in the power industry to the world's peak.
Five, in order to meet the needs of continuous leap forward of the power industry in the future, so that China's power industry can catch up with the United Kingdom in the shortest possible time, and so that the scientific and technological work of the power industry can catch up with the world's most advanced level as soon as possible, it is also necessary to seize the work of power planning and preliminary selection of plant and dam sites.
Six, we must also continue to vigorously cultivate scientific and technological talents in the power industry, paying special attention to cutting-edge technologies and some blank disciplines, and helping the cultivation and improvement of red young activists who have emerged from technical innovation and technical revolution, so as to more rapidly expand technical strength and better adapt to the needs of continuous leap forward in the future.
Finally, through the various political movements in recent years, especially through the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the great anti-Rightist rectification movement, we have deeply realized that intellectuals must accelerate their self-transformation, resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, eliminate the bourgeois individualism, abandon the bourgeois world outlook, establish the proletarian world outlook, and resolutely stand on the position of the proletariat. Only in this way can we make greater contributions in our work and better serve the cause for socialist construction. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works to improve our political and theoretical level, become red and expert working-class intellectuals, actively participate in mass movements, and be tempered in mass movements to achieve a double harvest of ideology and business.
At present, the power industry, like other sectors of the national economy, has an infinitely good situation. We must hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, further implement the Party's general line for building socialism, launch the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations", and strive to victoriously realize the greater leap forward of the power industry in 1960.

    努力作好电力工业的科学技术研究工作
    于开泉、毛鹤年、徐士高、覃修典、杨定安、鲍国宝代表孙保基、黄育贤委员的联合发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的报告。现在仅就电力工业工作方面，发表一些意见，请指正。	电力工业大跃进，科学技术研究成绩出色
    1959年我国电力工业，在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了更大的跃进。解放后十年来，发电量的平均年增长率为25.4％，已大大超过资本主义国家的发展速度。1958年发电量的年增长率为42％，1959年发电量的年增长率为51％更是资本主义国家所望尘莫及。1959年发电量达四百一十五亿度，生产水平在全世界所占的地位，由1949年的第二十五位跃居第九位。
    第一个五年计划内，我国发电设备容量共增加了二百四十六万九千瓩，而1958年一年就增加了一百八十万瓩，1959年又增加了三百二十万瓩，比英国同年所增加的一百八十四万瓩超过73.9％。在年增加设备的规模上，已经把英国远远抛在后面。
    在贯彻党的大中小并举、洋土并举的两条腿走路的方针下，我国电力工业大搞群众运动，全民办电，不仅为供应城市和工业生产日益高涨的用电需要起到了巨大的作用，同时也为解决农村用电与开展农村电气化，开辟了新的途径。目前成千上万的小土群与小洋群，正在全国范围内遍地开花，方兴未艾地发展着。
    随着电力工业的大跃进，出现了电力工业科学技术工作的大发展，其主要成就表现在下列各方面：
    一、近年来不但建设了大量的水、火力发电厂和高压输电线路同变电站，其中并有大量的现代化技术装备投入运行。目前我国已能独立进行一百万瓩以上的水、火电厂的设计和施工，并掌握了大型水轮发电机、大型高温高压火电设备，以及新型自动化、远动化设备的制造、安装、调整、运行和检修，根本上改变了我国过去在这方面的落后面貌。
    二、通过群众性的技术革新技术革命运动，解决了关键性的技术问题，进行了提高设备出力、不停电检修线路、线路升压运行、供用电合作化等重大的技术革新，达到多发电、多供电和保证安全经济运行。1959年每瓩容量的发电设备，平均发出六千多度电，比较1949年的二千三百三十度提高了一倍半，火电厂每度电平均煤耗，比较1949年将近减低一半，而且燃用了四百万吨以上的低质煤。
    三、在基建方面，取得了缩短工期、降低造价、节约原材料等重大成就。水电厂、火电厂和输电线路的工期，都比第一个五年计划期间约缩短一半，造价也降低了一半左右。例如黄河三门峡、浙江新安江等大水电厂，都将提前发电；一些水电站作到了一个枯水期即可拦洪发电。在第一个五年计划里一般火电厂建设进度，是一年设计、一年准备、一年施工，目前高温高压火电厂从开工到第一台机组发电，大多数都不超过一年；有一些工程做到当年连续投入几台机组。在建设露天、半露天发电厂方面，进行了若干试点，取得了设计、施工和运行经验，为今后广泛地推广这种布置创造条件。
    四、为了准备更大型水、火电厂和电力网
  的远景建设，在科学研究方面贯彻了远近结合的方针，既进行了尖端的科学的研究，也解决了近期工程和技术上的问题。例如动态模拟、电子模拟计算机等尖端计算工具的试制和采用，超高压工程的设计和保护设备的研究，电力网的自动化，大型水轮发电机组的研究等等，都取得了很大的成就，为我国电力工业的科学技术迅速攀登世界顶峰准备条件。
    五、随着电力生产建设的高速和普遍发展，电力工业的技术力量也迅速的成长起来，目前各省区都有了自己的设计、施工、运行和科研队伍，有了强大的又红又专的青年工人和技术人员；还有各地的高等和中等专业学校，和生产单位一道，采取了一主二辅三结合的方式，培养新生力量。同时，随着技术革新和技术革命运动的广泛开展，电力科学知识，也逐渐为广大群众所掌握运用。
    六、在蓬勃发展的以四化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，在很短的时间内，群众性的创造风起云涌，内容也非常丰富。火电厂的运煤除灰，电厂和线路的检修工作，以及各种工程的施工方面，机械化的程度不断提高，创造了不少洋土结合的机械化工具。在自动化方面，安徽梅山等水电厂已做到完全自动化，在中心调度所进行远距离控制；上海杨树浦火电厂六号机试行自启动或停机获得初步成功，京津唐和上海电网中已有七十多所无人值班或在家值班的变电所。
      大搞群众运动是
      胜利的重要保证
    大跃进以来电力工业在科学技术方面所取得的巨大成就，有力地说明了只要认真地贯彻党的社会主义总路线，坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，科学技术工作也和其他工作一样，就可以连续地大跃进。过去依靠少数专家在试验室冷冷清清地进行研究工作，很少成绩，而大跃进以来轰轰烈烈地大搞群众运动，技术关键问题就迎刃而解，有些尖端科学技术问题也得到解决。在电力工业科学技术中，任何较大的成绩都是贯彻领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合方针与发扬共产主义大协作的精神的结果。例如检修线路设备，过去都需要先停电再进行工作，但鞍山电业局贯彻三结合的方针，并由专业试验研究单位与生产单位协作，就成功地创造了不停电检修线路的经验。这种经验已推广到全国，并经过群众的改进，发展到二十二万伏电压的线路上，从而解决了线路因停电检修而影响供电问题。又如磁吹避雷器还是先进的新技术，我国开始由少数人进行研究，进展迟缓，但经过发动科研、制造、运行、学校等十几个单位共同进行研究，在很短时间内就试制成功。
    电力工业科学技术之所以能够飞跃地发展，是和电力工业的高速度发展分不开的。例如为了解决供电线路送电容量不足问题，就研究线路的升压运行，这推动了高压线路内部过电压及其保护设备的科学研究，使我国高压技术迅速提高。又如为了节约钢材才发展了钢筋混凝土电杆的设计和钢筋混凝土结构在电力工业各方面的应用。除十一万伏线路上，已经普遍使用钢筋混凝土电杆外，最近在二十二万伏线路上也采用了带拉线的钢筋混凝土单杆。跨距一千七百二十二米，两端杆塔高一百四十六点七五米，跨越长江的二十二万伏线路，也采用了钢筋混凝土结构，为世界上大跨越线路采用这种结构的创举。最近在水火电工程中，采用大直径的压力钢筋混凝土水管，节约了大量钢板，也是过去未曾有过的新设计。这些例子说明党所指示的以任务带动学科，科学技术为生产建设服务的方针的正确性。
    大跃进以来由于解放思想，发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，在科学技术上取得了许多成就。例如，发电设备的出力，过去一直限于制造厂规定的容量。但大跃进以来，为了满足国民经济事业用电的急需，电业工作者破除迷信，由专业研究试验单位和生产现场的密切合作，对设备进行了详细计算、研究、试验和运行考验之后，提高绝大部分发电设备的出力5％至30％，全国共提高出力总数达到九十多万瓩，对增加电力的供应起了很大的作用。
    很多科学技术上的成就是与学习苏联及其他兄弟国家的先进技术分不开的。在学习的过程中，电业工作者又根据我国的具体情况加以发展。如我国为了解决使用当地材料筑坝和施工技术问题，学习了苏联水中倒土和定向爆破等新的方法。汾河水库水中倒土坝高达六十米。
    在学习国外先进经验的同时，也需要贯彻洋土结合的方针。例如三门峡围堰的设计，充分利用了黄河泥沙的淤积作用，是一个新的成就。位山工程成功地采用了我国传统的合龙方法。胜利地截断了黄河。又如在火电厂的施工中，用二台五十吨吊车，就成功地吊装一百七十吨重的十万瓩发电机静子。
    在发扬共产主义大协作方面，上海热电厂在市委的领导下，得到了各企业、行政单位、学校、部队等五十多个单位的协作支援，使这个高温高压发电厂的建设，六个月第一台机组就开始发电，十个月就全部完成，创造了火电厂快速建设的纪录。又如供电方式，过去工厂内外、工厂和工厂之间、工业用电和居民用电、工厂内电灯和电力用电，都各有分开的线路，分别装设变压器供电。哈尔滨首先创造了“四合一”环形供电的经验，使各种线路都联接起来，从而大大提高供电能力，还节约大量设备。这不仅是一个技术问题，而且是使生产管理方式适应于社会主义的生产方式以促进社会生产力发展的一个重大问题；不仅是一个改革供用电系统的技术经验，而且是一个如何充分利用和发挥社会主义制度的优越性的经验。
    电力工业在科学技术工作方面的胜利是在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线的胜利，是贯彻党领导科学技术方针的胜利。
    大闹技术革新攀登技术高峰
    1960年是我国国民经济各部门连续大跃进的一年。这在国民经济计划草案中已经充分地体现出来。完成这个计划，电力工业生产水平将达到五百五十五至五百八十亿度，新增的发电设备容量为四百二十万瓩，这是一个十分令人鼓舞的连续跃进的计划，也是我们电力工业工作者的艰巨而光荣的任务。我们坚信有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有建设社会主义的三大法宝和高速度发展电力工业的经验以及苏联和各兄弟国家的支援；只要我们在具体工作中坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，我们电力工业不仅能够高速度发展，而且一定能连续高速度地发展。我们有坚定的信心，保证完成和超额完成1960年电力工业计划；并为整个六十年代连续跃进打下良好的基础，争取在最短的时间内，赶上或超过英国，在电力科学技术方面尽快地赶上世界先进水平，攀登世界高峰。为此，我们还必须从以下几个方面努力：
    一、积极投入当前正在蓬勃发展的，以四化为中心的群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，提高发电厂、电力网以及施工现场的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、远动化的水平。达到提高劳动生产率，使电力工业取得更高速度的发展。
    二、迅速掌握最新型的大发电设备的设计、施工与运行技术；积极进行研究试验和推广新设备、新结构、新布置、新品种代用材料，进一步节约材料，降低造价，加快建设的速度。
    三、为加速农业技术改造，我们一定遵照李副总理在报告中所提出的，把支援农业技术改造作为自己的重要任务，积极推动农村电气化工作，研究适合各地农村特点的电气化规划方案和发供电技术。培养农村电气化的技术人材，以加速农村电气化工作。
    四、为了今后电力工业更大规模发展的需要，大力开展科学研究工作，贯彻远近结合的方针结合当前的电力建设，种好水工、发电、送电、系统等方面的试验田，推动电力工业科学技术工作迅速攀登世界高峰。
    五、为了满足今后电力工业连续跃进的需要，使我国电力工业在最短时间内赶上英国，以及使电力工业科学技术工作尽快赶上世界最先进的水平，还需要抓紧电力规划和预先选择厂址坝址等工作。
    六、还要继续大力培养电力工业的科学技术人材，特别注意尖端技术和一些空白学科，帮助从技术革新技术革命中涌现出来的红色青年积极分子的培养提高，以便更迅速地扩大技术力量，更适应今后不断跃进的需要。
    最后，我们通过几年来的各项政治运动，特别是通过党的八届八中全会文件的学习和伟大的反右倾整风运动，深深地体会到知识分子必须加速自我改造，要坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，肃清资产阶级个人主义思想，抛弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，坚决站到无产阶级立场上来。这样才能在工作中作出更大的贡献，更好的为社会主义建设事业服务。我们必须认真学习毛主席著作提高政治理论水平，成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，积极投入群众运动中去，在群众运动中受到锻炼，求得思想、业务双丰收。
    当前电力工业也和其他国民经济各部门一样，形势无限好，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗进一步贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线，大搞以四化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，为胜利实现1960年电力工业更大跃进而奋斗。
