Xinqiu Civil Engineering and Construction Team of Fuxin Mining Bureau
Is a Construction Team and a Materials Factory
Basic Self-Sufficiency in Construction Materials Ensures Early Completion of Construction Tasks

According to a report in the Liaoning Daily, the characteristic of the Xinqiu Civil Engineering and Construction Team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau is that it is both a construction unit and a material production unit. They have used simple methods to set up brick factories, tile factories, ceramic factories, plastic factories, and support factories, vigorously engaging in material production and material substitution, providing all the materials needed for industrial construction, civil construction, business repairs, and underground projects. In 1959, except for a small amount of lumber allocated by the state, the team was completely self-sufficient in other building materials. Due to self-reliance overcoming the difficulty of material shortages, they successfully completed the construction project of more than 30,000 square meters and a water pool project last year, entering 1960 thirty-six days ahead of schedule. Now, although the building materials they produce are basically self-sufficient, the entire team is further vigorously engaging in material production, aiming to generally double the production of satellite factories in order to ensure the early and comprehensive completion of this year's construction tasks.

Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the continuous acceleration of construction speed, the supply of some raw materials has not been timely, often affecting the progress of some projects. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the entire team of employees, after careful discussion, decided to rely on their own efforts to establish material factories. The masses criticized the conservative idea that "we have no money, no materials, and no people, so we cannot run a material factory," and were full of enthusiasm. All the employees and their families were mobilized to use indigenous methods and used the red soil that is everywhere in the mining area to set up brick and tile factories; they used the waste gangue and refractory clay picked out from the nearby North Open-pit Coal Mine to set up a ceramic factory. The employees also learned from the experience of the Anshan Plastics Factory in using plastics to replace wood, repaired the three dilapidated houses in the factory to serve as factory buildings, made several mortar troughs and various molds, and produced finished products in only three days. They also established a support factory, using crushed coke slag, placing bamboo or wood cores to replace steel bars to make supports. The cost of the supports is two-thirds less than that of pit wood, and they are not afraid of water or pressure, and will not be damaged for a year, so they can completely replace pit wood.

    阜新矿务局新丘土木建筑工程队
    是施工队又是材料厂
    施工所需材料基本自给　保证了提前完成施工任务
    据辽宁日报消息　是施工单位也是材料生产单位，这是阜新矿务局新丘土木建筑工程队的特色。他们用穷办法办起砖厂、瓦厂、陶瓷厂、塑料厂、支柱厂，大搞材料生产和材料代用，自己提供工业建筑、民用建筑、事业补修、井下工程等各方面所需的材料。1959年，全队除国家拨给少许栋梁木材外，其余的建筑材料完全自给。由于自力更生克服了材料不足的困难。去年顺利完成了全年三万多平方米的建筑工程任务和一个水池工程任务，提前三十六天跨进1960年。现在，他们所生产的建筑材料虽然已经基本自给自足，全队还在进一步大搞材料生产，要使卫星厂的生产普遍翻番，以便保证提前全面完成今年的施工任务。
    大跃进以来，这个队由于建设速度不断加快，某些原料材料一时供应不及时，常常影响一些工程的进度。全队职工在党组织的领导下，经过认真讨论，决定自力更生大办材料工厂。群众批判了所谓“一无钱、二无料、三无人，无法办材料厂”的保守思想，干劲冲天。全队职工和家属都动员起来，土法上马，用矿区遍地皆是的红土，办起了砖厂和瓦厂；用附近北露天煤矿挑出的废?子石和耐火土，办起了陶瓷厂。职工又学习鞍山塑料厂用塑料代替木材的经验，把厂里三间破烂房子修好做厂房，做了几个合灰槽子、各种模子，只用三天，就出了成品。他们还搞成支柱厂，用压碎的炉焦渣子，搁上竹心或木心代替钢筋制出支柱。支柱的成本比坑木少三分之二，而且不怕水泡，不怕压力，一年也坏不了，可以全部代替坑木。
