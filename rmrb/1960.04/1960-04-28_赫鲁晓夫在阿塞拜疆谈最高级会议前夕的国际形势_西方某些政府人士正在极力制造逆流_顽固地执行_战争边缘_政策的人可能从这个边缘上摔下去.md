Xinhua News Agency, Baku, April 27th—TASS reports: The Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic held a celebration assembly on the 25th to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime in Azerbaijan and the founding of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. Nikita Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, attended the celebration assembly and delivered a lengthy speech.

In his speech, Khrushchev first extended warm congratulations to all the working people of Azerbaijan on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Khrushchev then discussed some current international issues.

Khrushchev said, "I believe that the positive progress of easing international tensions will continue in the future. At the same time, I consider it my duty to point out some unfavorable phenomena in international life that are causing some tension."

Khrushchev said, "Soon, in about three weeks, the summit meeting of the four major powers will open in Paris. The people of all countries, especially those who advocate easing international tensions and hope to resolve disputes that hinder the development of friendly relations between countries, are now asking with excitement: What will be the outcome of the summit meeting, and will their hopes for this meeting be realized? This mood is completely understandable, because everyone wants world peace, with the exception of a small group of adventurers, stubborn militarists, and revanchists."

Khrushchev pointed out that the disarmament issue, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin, the relations between East and West, and the cessation of nuclear testing will be discussed at the four-power conference. After stating the Soviet government's position on these issues one by one, he said, "I want to express some vigilance. The closer the date of the heads of government meeting, namely May 16, the more unilaterally some government officials in Western countries treat the issues facing the participants in the meeting. They seek out and exaggerate certain aspects of this or that issue, and excessive attention to these aspects does not help to formulate solutions acceptable to everyone. This approach obviously does not help to find ways to solve major international problems. On the contrary, it will maintain tension, thereby hindering the normalization of relations between countries."

"There is no need to look far for examples. Take the recent speech by US Under Secretary of State Dillon. This speech elaborated on the US policy towards the summit meeting. This speech exudes the atmosphere of the Cold War. Dillon's speech is less a responsible political statement than a collection of old clichés that distort the Soviet Union and socialist countries. He talks at length about the 'constant threat of communism to the world', calls for 'abandoning' the idea of peaceful coexistence, and crudely distorts the Soviet disarmament proposals and proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and turning West Berlin into a free city."

"Just on the eve of the summit meeting, when it is so necessary to support and create an atmosphere of trust between countries, Dillon is vigorously creating a countercurrent of hostility and suspicion."

Dillon called the summit meeting a "test of the Soviet Union's sincerity" and pretended as if the outcome of the meeting depended only on the Soviet Union and not on all the countries participating in the meeting.

"No, no one can undermine the trust in the Soviet Union's sincerity. The Soviet Union's policy is clear, full of love for peace, and resolutely sympathized with by the people of all countries. In the eyes of the people of all countries, the summit meeting is indeed a serious test of the policies of the countries participating in the meeting, and most likely a test of the policy of the United States itself. If there were no other factors discovered now, I would not talk about the speech of the US Deputy Secretary of State. Unfortunately, these factors are reflected not only in words but also in actions."

Khrushchev emphatically criticized the Western countries' policy of supervision without disarmament, which they have adopted so far. He said: "We advocate strict supervision under the conditions of disarmament, and we oppose supervision without disarmament. The Soviet Union insists on this position and will not retreat in any way."

Khrushchev continued, "It seems that the aggressive groups in the imperialist countries are still strong. They will never recognize that the 'policy of strength' advocated by the late Dulles, which they tried to implement not long ago, has now lost its realistic basis. These groups still cannot tolerate the existence of the socialist camp, because the socialist camp is holding the imperialists by the throat."

"The aggressive groups in Western countries are obstructing the agreement on the disarmament issue, is it because they still hope to continue to accumulate strength and attempt to re-implement the 'position of strength' policy, and they fantasize about relying on this policy to eliminate socialist countries? But, gentlemen, this is not up to you to decide."

"The socialist countries have obtained the right to live, and the current status in the world is not due to the recognition of the League of Nations or the United Nations. They have obtained this right in the revolutionary struggle, and the people of all socialist countries now maintain and consolidate this right through the successful development of the economy and relying on the power of the state's armed forces."

"So we say to our enemies: If you attempt to pursue a 'position of strength' policy, then of course we must also take necessary actions on our side; we must consider using the strength of the socialist countries to deal with your strength. Now the strength of the socialist countries is not smaller than the strength of the imperialist countries, but is greater. At the same time, the power of socialist countries will grow day by day and year by year."

"A policy based on blind hatred of the social system of socialist countries has no future. The money spent by the imperialists on the 'position of strength' policy will be wasted and will not bring them any political and economic interest."

"The imperialists' aggressive policy is hated by the people of neutral countries and those countries that have been liberated from colonial rule. The people of these countries want peace and free development. After gaining national independence, they are trying their best to consolidate and develop their own economy. The imperialist policy is also increasingly hated by the people of the governments that pursue this policy, because this policy damages the economy of these countries, depletes it, and damages the material living standards of the residents."

"Imperialist gentlemen, you once fantasized that you might win the 'Cold War' without a 'hot' war, that is, by sharpening the international situation and pursuing a 'brink of war' policy to force socialist countries to consume material resources for non-productive purposes. Obviously, when you imposed the arms race on us, you expected not only to hinder the economic, scientific and cultural development of socialist countries, but also to bankrupt them, thereby damaging the reputation of the socialist social system."

"Anyone who stubbornly continues to implement the 'brink of war' policy may fall off this edge, and war will break out. And war will bring disaster, and the first to suffer disaster will be those countries whose governments do not want to understand the necessity of peaceful coexistence. The people of all countries will not forgive the social system that has provoked two world wars and caused the global disaster of rocket-nuclear war. They will eliminate this system, that is, eliminate capitalism."

Khrushchev said that the position taken by some Western state activists on the German issue to be discussed at the summit caused us no small alarm. It seems that some people want to turn this meeting into an exchange of opinions without any responsibility, or into a light and pleasant conversation, so as to avoid formulating concrete solutions to the disarmament issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany that I talked about.

"Please look at Mr. Herter's remarks. He leads the US State Department and is the decision-maker of his country's foreign policy. His speech in Chicago on April 4 can only be regrettable. The speech shows that Mr. Herter is far from understanding the current situation with a realistic attitude. The main thing that countries that once fought against Hitler's Germany can do today to solve the German problem is to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. But Mr. Herter wants to attract us to discuss the reunification of Germany, where to hold a referendum, to discuss issues that the countries attending the summit should not discuss."

"The reunification of Germany is a matter for the Germans themselves. They did not entrust us to study their internal affairs, and they did not give us such full power. Even if the Germans made such a request to the four major powers, we should refuse, because the issue of German reunification can only be resolved by the Germans themselves, not anyone else. Mr. Herter should understand this well. We cannot let ourselves get involved in any discussion of this issue."

"Another thing is to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. This issue is entirely within the power of the victorious countries, and the conditions for resolving this issue have long been ripe. So we will explain the necessity of resolving this issue and the West Berlin issue related to it. Maintaining the current situation in West Berlin will mean maintaining a source of provocation, which may produce all kinds of accidents and conflicts, and may even cause disasters."

"In fact, some politicians and journalists often follow Chancellor Adenauer and repeat his old tune. They say that if they take a tough attitude, do not give an inch, and show that they are strong, then the Soviet Union will tolerate the existing situation, and Western countries will be able to maintain their position in West Berlin, that is, continue to station troops there. In order to avoid any illusions, I would like to state publicly and frankly: Those who have this idea and follow this policy will be disappointed. The Soviet government will do everything possible to clarify our position and will spare no effort to convince our counterparts of the necessity of concluding a peace treaty and establishing a free city in West Berlin."

"However, if Western countries, regardless of all our efforts, are unwilling to seek mutually acceptable ways to solve the peace treaty issue with the Soviet Union, and continue to unreasonably ignore this issue, then of course we will go our own way and conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. I think that the conclusion of this peace treaty will not be only the Soviet Union alone. Many other countries will sign this peace treaty with us, and they also believe in the necessity of peace with Germany."

Khrushchev said that those who hold an aggressive policy towards socialist countries often reason that after concluding a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, the three Western countries can still maintain the right to station troops in West Berlin. I should say that this is an incorrect understanding, and the policy built on this calculation is destined to fail.

"Everyone knows that the conclusion of a peace treaty will end all situations arising from the surrender of the country. Therefore, if a peace treaty is concluded with the German Democratic Republic, then in the entire territory under the jurisdiction of the government of this country, the situation caused by the surrender will be eliminated. In this way, the rights that Western countries maintain over this territory due to the surrender of Hitler's Germany will lose effect, including the right to continue to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin."

"Some politicians say that they do not recognize the German Democratic Republic, so they do not want to deal with it. They even demand to maintain the troops of the three countries stationed in West Berlin, and demand to maintain the rights to this city under the surrender terms by means of force."

"I should warn these hotheads that if they do not resort to rights and laws now, but use force, then this force will naturally be countered by the force of the other side, and the latter force is based on law and rights, and therefore will definitely gain the moral support of all countries. It is impossible not to do so."

"Our policy is based on realistic conditions. The Soviet government proceeds from good intentions, that is: to eradicate the remnants of World War II, eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin, and give West Berlin the status of a free city. Despite all kinds of speculations and malicious propaganda from the West, no one intends to infringe on the property and freedom of rights of the residents of West Berlin. They will have ample possibilities and all conditions to freely choose the political system and social system that suits their wishes."

"But West Berlin is within the territory of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, with the signing of the peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic will exercise sovereignty over the entire territory of its own country. Therefore, if Western countries do not intend to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, then this cannot reserve for them the rights they insist on reserving. Naturally, they will then lose the right to enter West Berlin from land, water and air." Khrushchev finally said, "Now, the Soviet Union is stronger than ever before. Our strength is indestructible. If this power is in the hands of imperialism, it will make the people of neighboring countries, and not just neighboring countries, feel very unpleasant and uneasy. Because the strength of imperialism is for the purpose of aggression and is a means of exerting pressure on other countries."

"However, the Soviet Union, as a socialist country, pursues a peaceful policy."

"The power of the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for the security of our country's borders and our fraternal socialist countries, and it is an obstacle on the road of aggressors."

After participating in commemorative activities and visiting, Khrushchev returned to Moscow today.

### 赫鲁晓夫在阿塞拜疆谈最高级会议前夕的国际形势  西方某些政府人士正在极力制造逆流  顽固地执行“战争边缘”政策的人可能从这个边缘上摔下去

    赫鲁晓夫在阿塞拜疆谈最高级会议前夕的国际形势
    西方某些政府人士正在极力制造逆流
    顽固地执行“战争边缘”政策的人可能从这个边缘上摔下去
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社巴库讯：苏联阿塞拜疆共和国最高苏维埃在25日举行庆祝大会，庆祝阿塞拜疆苏维埃政权建立和阿塞拜疆共产党成立四十周年。苏联部长会议主席、苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫参加了庆祝大会，并在会上发表了长篇讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中首先代表苏共中央、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团，向阿塞拜疆全体劳动人民表示了热烈的祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了当前的一些国际问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我想，国际局势和缓的良好进展今后仍将会继续下去，同时我认为，指出国际生活中的引起某种紧张的不良现象也是我的义务。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不久，大约再过三个星期，四大国领导人的会议就要在巴黎开幕了。所有国家的人民、特别是那些主张缓和国际紧张局势和希望解决妨碍各国家友善关系发展的争端的人们，现在都怀着激动的心情提出一个问题：最高级会谈会谈出什么结果，他们对这次会议的希望是否能够实现。这种心情是完全可以理解的。因为所有人都希望世界和平。只有一小撮冒险家、顽固成性的军国主义分子和复仇主义分子例外。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在四大国会议上将要讨论裁军问题，缔结对德和约和消除西柏林的占领制度问题，东西方之间的关系问题，停止核试验问题。他在逐一申述了苏联政府在这些问题上的立场以后说，我要表示某些警觉。离开政府首脑会谈的日子、即5月16日越近，西方国家的某些政府人士也越来越片面地对待会谈参加者所面临的问题。他们寻找和夸大的正是这个或那个问题的某些方面，而对这些方面过分注意无助于制定使大家都能接受的解决办法。这种做法显然无助于找寻解决国际重大问题的途径，相反地，它将保持紧张局势，从而妨碍国与国之间关系的正常化。
    不需要到很远的地方去找例子。就拿美国副国务卿狄龙不久前的讲话来说吧。这个讲话阐述了美国对最高级会议采取的政策。这个讲话发出冷战的气息。狄龙的讲话与其说是负责任的政治声明，不如说是对苏联和社会主义国家老一套的歪曲的汇集。他大谈而特谈“共产主义对世界的经常威胁”，号召“摒弃”和平共处的主张，粗暴地歪曲苏联的裁军建议以及关于缔结对德和约和变西柏林为自由城市的建议。
    正当最高级会议的前夕，如此需要支持和创造各国信任气氛的时候，狄龙却在极力制造敌意和怀疑的逆流。
    狄龙把最高级会议称作“对苏联有无诚意的考验”，并且装出一副姿态，仿佛会议的结局只取决于苏联，而不取决于参加会议的所有各国。
    不，任何人都不能破坏对苏联诚意的信任，苏联的政策是明确的，充满对和平的热爱，并且受到各国人民的坚决的同情。在各国人民看来，最高级会议确实是对参加会议的国家的政策的严重的考验，而最可能是对美国自己的政策的考验。赫鲁晓夫说，如果现在没有发现其他的因素的话，我就不会谈到美国副国务卿的讲话，遗憾的是，这些因素不仅在口头上，而且在行动中都有反映。
    赫鲁晓夫着重地批判了西方国家迄今所采取的没有裁军的监督的政策。他说：我们主张在裁军条件下的严格监督，我们反对没有裁军的监督。苏联坚持这个立场，无论如何也不退却。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，看来，帝国主义国家中侵略集团还强大，他们无论如何也不会认识到，他们不久以前还企图实行的、已故杜勒斯所提倡的“实力政策”现在已经失去了它的现实基础。这些集团仍然不能容忍社会主义阵营的存在，因为社会主义阵营扼住了帝国主义者的喉咙。
    西方国家的侵略集团阻挠就裁军问题达成协议，是不是因为还希望继续积蓄力量，企图重新执行“实力地位”政策，它们幻想依靠这个政策来消灭社会主义国家。但是，先生们，这可不由你们来决定。
    社会主义国家获得生活的权利，在现世界中获得今天的地位并不是由于国际联盟或者联合国的承认。它们是在革命斗争中取得这个权利的，各社会主义国家的人民现在通过顺利地发展经济和依靠国家武装力量的威力，保持和巩固这个权利。
    所以我们向我们的敌人说：如果你们企图奉行“实力地位”政策，那么当然我们方面也要采取必要的行动；我们就要考虑用社会主义各国的力量来对付你们的力量。现在社会主义国家的力量不是比帝国主义国家的力量要小，而是要大。同时社会主义国家的威力将逐日逐年地增长。
    从对社会主义国家的社会制度的盲目仇恨出发的政策是没有前途的。帝国主义分子用在“实力地位”政策上的金钱都将白费，不会给他们带来任何政治和经济利息。
    帝国主义者的侵略政策是中立国家和那些从殖民主义统治下解放出来的国家的人民所憎恨的。这些国家的人民希望和平和获得自由发展。它们在取得了民族独立之后，就竭力巩固和发展本国的经济。帝国主义政策也越来越为那些奉行这种政策的政府的国内人民所憎恨，因为这种政策损害这些国家的经济，使其枯竭，损害居民的物质生活水平。
    帝国主义先生们，你们从前幻想：你们可能在不进行“热”战的情况下赢得“冷”战的胜利，即通过使国际局势尖锐化和奉行“战争边缘”政策的办法来迫使社会主义国家把物质资料消耗在非生产目的之上。显然，当你们把军备竞赛强加在我们身上时，你们指望不仅会阻止社会主义国家的经济、科学和文化的发展，而且还使之破产，从而破坏社会主义社会制度的声誉。
    谁要是一味顽固地继续执行“战争边缘”政策，他就可能从这个边缘上摔下去，战争就会爆发。而战争将会带来灾难，首先遭受灾难的将是这样一些国家：这些国家的政府不想理解和平共处的必要性。各国人民将不会饶恕那个已经挑起两次世界大战的、引起产生火箭—核战争这种全人类灾祸的社会制度，他们将会消灭这个制度，即消灭资本主义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家某些国家活动家对即将在高级会议上讨论德国问题所采取的立场引起我们不小的警觉。看来，有人想使这次会晤变为不负什么责任的意见交换会，或者变为一种轻松愉快的交谈，从而避免就我所谈到的裁军问题和缔结对德和约问题拟订具体的解决办法。
    请看看赫脱先生的言论。他领导美国国务院，是本国外交政策的决策人。他4月4日在芝加哥发表的演说只能令人感到遗憾。演说表明，赫脱先生远没有以现实主义的态度来理解目前的局势。曾同希特勒德国交战的国家今天可以为解决德国问题做的主要的事，就是缔结对德和约。但赫脱先生想把我们吸引到讨论德国重新统一问题，在那里举行什么公民投票、讨论出席高级会议的国家所不应该讨论的问题这样一条道路上去。
    德国的重新统一，这是德国人自己的事，他们并没有委托我们去研究他们内政，并没有给我们这样的全权。就是德国人向四大国提出这样的请求，我们也应该拒绝，因为德国重新统一问题只能由德国人自己，而不是其他任何人来解决。赫脱先生应该好好地理解这点。我们不能让自己卷入对这个问题的任何讨论。
    另一件事是缔结对德和约。这一问题完全是战胜国权限内的问题，解决这一问题的条件早已成熟。所以我们将说明解决这一问题和同它有关的西柏林问题的必要性。保持西柏林目前的局面将意味着保持挑衅的策源地，这个策源地可能产生一切意外和冲突，甚至可能引起灾难。
  其实，某些政治家和记者常常追随着阿登纳总理，重弹他的老调。他们说，如果采取强硬态度，寸步不让并表现得很坚强，那么，苏联便会容忍现存局面，西方国家便能够保持自己在西柏林的地位，即继续在那里驻扎军队。为了不致于产生任何幻想，我想公开而坦率地声明：那些有这种想法和遵循这种政策的人必将失望。苏联政府将尽一切努力来阐明我们的立场，并将不遗余力地使我们的对方相信缔结和约和建立西柏林自由城市的必要性。
    但是，如果西方国家不顾我们的一切努力，不愿意同苏联一道寻求彼此都可以接受的解决和约问题的途径，仍然不理智地无视这一问题，那么，我们当然就要走我们的路，同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。我想，缔结这一和约的决不会是苏联一个国家。同我们一道签署这一和约的将有许多其他国家，它们也相信对德国媾和的必要性。
    赫鲁晓夫说，对社会主义国家抱侵略方针的人往往这样推论，似乎在同德意志民主共和国缔结和约以后，三个西方国家照样可以保持在西柏林驻扎军队的权利。我应当说，这是一种不正确的理解，建筑在这种推算上面的政策注定要失败。
    大家知道，缔结和约就会结束由于国家投降而产生的一切情况。所以，如果同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，那么，在这个国家政府所管辖的全部领土上，就将消除由于投降所造成的情况。这样一来，西方国家由于希特勒德国投降而对这块领土保持的权利，就会失去效力，其中包括继续在西柏林保持占领制度的权利。
    某些政治家说，他们不承认德意志民主共和国，所以不想同它打交道。他们竟然要求保持三个国家的军队驻扎在西柏林，要求借助武力保持根据投降条款对这座城市的权利。
    我应当警告这些头脑发热的人，如果他们现在不诉诸权利和法律，而动用武力的话，那么，这种力量自然会受到另一方力量的反击，后一种力量是有法律和权利作为依据的，因此一定会获得所有国家道义上的支持。不这样是不可能的。
    我们的政策是以现实条件为基础的。苏联政府从善良的意图出发，这就是：铲除第二次世界大战的残迹，消除西柏林占领制度，给西柏林以自由城市的地位。尽管西方作种种臆测和进行不怀好意的宣传，可是无论谁都不打算侵犯西柏林居民的财产和权利的自由。他们将有充分的可能性和一切条件来自由选择符合他们心愿的政治制度和社会制度。
    但是西柏林是在德意志民主共和国领土之内。所以，随着和约的签订，德意志民主共和国将在自己整个国家的领土上行使主权。因此，如果西方国家不打算同德意志民主共和国签订和约，那么这就不能为它们保留它们坚持保留的权利。自然它们那时就要失去从陆地、水上和空中进入西柏林的权利。赫鲁晓夫最后说，现在，苏联比从前任何时候都更强大。我们的力量是坚不可摧的。如果这种威力掌握在帝国主义手中，那就会使邻国人民，而且不只是邻国感到非常不愉快和不安。因为，帝国主义的实力是为了侵略的目的，是对其他国家施加压力的手段。
    但是，作为社会主义国家的苏联执行的是和平政策。
    苏联的威力是我国国境和我们兄弟社会主义国家的安全的可靠的保证，是侵略者道路上的障碍。
    赫鲁晓夫在参加纪念活动和参观访问后，已在今天返回莫斯科。
