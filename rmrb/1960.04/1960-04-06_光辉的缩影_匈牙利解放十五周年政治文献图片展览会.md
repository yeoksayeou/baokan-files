The Glorious Epitome
—Political Document and Photo Exhibition on the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Hungary
By Our Correspondent Xù Lěi
	When people encounter the birthday of their loved ones, they will celebrate for them with special enthusiasm. With this feeling, I visited the "Political Document and Photo Exhibition on the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Hungary" which opened in Beijing on April 1st. More than two hundred vivid pictures displayed in the waterside pavilion of Zhongshan Park transported visitors to the fraternal country twelve thousand kilometers away. One moving picture after another showed people the epitome of Hungary's development and changes over the past fifteen years. I stood for a long time in front of the huge picture at the entrance. The Statue of Liberty on Gellért Hill stands proudly. At its feet, the beautiful city on both sides of the Danube presents a scene of prosperity.
	People who have experienced hardship and struggle will especially feel the sweetness and preciousness of a happy life. Today's happy life in Hungary, contrasted with the crimes of the reactionary rule before liberation and the counter-revolutionary riots in 1956, makes people deeply feel how hard-won this happiness is! The pictures here tell us: Before liberation, the Hungarian people suffered from hunger and cold under the rule of Horthy fascism; in October 1956, they were ravaged by counter-revolutionary elements. Look, the vicious rioters are massacring the outstanding sons of the Hungarian people—the communists, and burning the works of Petőfi—the Hungarian national hero and poet. How can this experience not make the Hungarian people doubly vigilant against imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements! Look at the heroic posture of the workers' guard established after the suppression of the riots; look at the mighty people's soldiers on the parade ground, they are defending the freedom of the motherland and the people, and defending the achievements of socialist construction.
	In the past fifteen years, Hungary's industry, agriculture, culture, education, science and other undertakings have made great progress. In front of the pictures showing the socialist industrial construction, two young viewers saw the towering furnace and the surging steel of the Danube Iron and Steel United Enterprise, which was newly built in Stalin City, and praised it constantly. Since 1949, Hungary has built more than 100 large-scale industrial enterprises. The three large blast furnaces newly built in Stalin City and Diósgyőr have doubled the output of pig iron. In 1958, Hungary had exported various industrial products to 104 countries and regions.
	Chinese viewers who are very familiar with agricultural cooperation felt particularly close to the photos of Hungary's developing agricultural production cooperatives. Seeing the peasants vying to join the cooperatives, seeing the chest-high, high-yielding wheat of the production cooperatives, seeing the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization, and seeing the signs of cooperative villages hanging in the villages, everyone was very excited. Look, irrigation canals and high-voltage lines have appeared in the countryside, airplanes are spraying pesticides, combine harvesters are running in the fields, newly installed artificial rainfall devices are watering the land, vegetables in large greenhouses are growing luxuriantly, and livestock and poultry have become accustomed to modern methods of collective feeding. The scenes of training a large number of tractor drivers from all over the country show that the Hungarian people are striving to realize agricultural mechanization.
	A middle school student with a schoolbag on his back was repeatedly watching the pictures of the development of Hungary's education with great interest. One of the photos particularly caught his attention, which was a scene of some Hungarian college and middle school students participating in labor and building the Hangshag irrigation canal. The students used their own hands to turn the originally abandoned small ditch into an irrigation canal for cultivated land. How intimate this is for Chinese young students!
	With the development of production, the Hungarian people's living standards have been rapidly improved. Look, the female workers are working happily in bright and clean workshops; the workers of local enterprises are dining in comfortable canteens; the shipbuilders are reading and playing chess in the club; every year thousands of workers go to Lake Balaton for recuperation. In the countryside, new houses equipped with electric lights and sanitary facilities have replaced the dilapidated thatched huts. Almost all rural areas in the country, including 94% of villages with less than 1,000 people, have libraries. The working people watch operas in the magnificent National Opera House. In the past ten years, the number of theatergoers has increased by 2.5 times. These fragments of life tell us that the life of the Hungarian people is getting better and better every day.
	When people are about to leave the exhibition hall, the beautiful Hungarian scenery makes them reluctant to leave. The Budapest Chain Bridge with huge lion heads carved on it, the wonderful night view of the Danube, the Tihany Peninsula and sailboats on Lake Balaton, and the Lillafüred Palace Hotel hidden in the mountains and trees and beautiful national costumes. People can't help but praise this beautiful and picturesque landscape. Now this country has been firmly in the hands of the Hungarian working people, and they are working hand in hand with socialist brother countries to build their beloved motherland even more magnificently.

    光辉的缩影
    ——匈牙利解放十五周年政治文献图片展览会
    本报记者　续磊
    每逢遇到自己亲人的诞辰，人们都会特别热情的为他庆贺。怀着这种情感，我参观了4月1日在北京开幕的“匈牙利解放十五周年政治文献图片展览会”。陈列在中山公园水榭的二百多幅生动的图片，把参观者带到了相距一万二千公里之遥的兄弟之邦，一幅幅动人的图景使人们看到了匈牙利十五年来发展和变化的缩影。我久久伫立在一进门那幅巨大的图片面前，盖勒特山上的自由神像骄傲的矗立着，在她的脚下，座落在多瑙河两岸的美丽城市，呈现出一片繁荣兴盛的景象。
    经历过艰难和斗争的人，会格外感到幸福生活的甜蜜和可贵。今天匈牙利人民幸福生活的图景，同解放前反动统治和1956年反革命暴乱的罪证对照之下，人们深深感到这幸福是多么来之不易呵！这里的图片告诉我们：匈牙利人民解放前在霍尔蒂法西斯统治下饥寒交迫；在1956年10月又遭到反革命分子的蹂躏。看吧，恶毒的暴乱分子在屠杀匈牙利人民的优秀儿子——共产主义者，在烧毁裴多菲——匈牙利民族英雄、诗人的著作。这种经历怎能不使匈牙利人民对帝国主义和反革命分子加倍警惕呢！你看那平息暴乱后建立的工人纠察队的雄姿；你看那阅兵场上威武的人民战士，他们在保卫着祖国和人民的自由，保卫着社会主义建设的成果。
    十五年来，匈牙利的工农业和文化、教育、科学等各项事业都有很大发展。在显示社会主义工业建设的图片前，两位青年观众看到斯大林城新建的多瑙河钢铁联合企业的高大的熔炉和奔流的钢水，不住地称赞。1949年以来匈牙利新建了一百多个大型工业企业，斯大林城和第奥士吉新建的三个大高炉，使生铁产量增加了一倍。1958年匈牙利已经向一百零四个国家和地区输出了各种工业产品。
    非常熟悉农业合作化的中国观众，对匈牙利正在发展中的农业生产合作社的照片感到特别亲切。看到那些争相入社的农民，看到生产合作社齐胸高的丰产小麦，看到正在逐步实现的农业机械化的情况，看到那村庄里挂起的合作社村的牌子，人人都非常兴奋。你看，农村出现了水利灌溉渠和高压线路，飞机在喷撒农药，联合收割机在田间奔驰，新安装的人工降雨装置在浇地，大型暖房中的蔬菜在繁茂生长，牲畜家禽已习惯地受着现代方法的集体饲养。从各地培养大批拖拉机手的镜头，使人们看到匈牙利人民正在为实现农业机械化而奋斗。
    一位身背书包的中学生饶有兴趣地在反复观看匈牙利教育事业发展的图片。其中一张照片特别引起他的注意，那是匈牙利一些大、中学生参加劳动，修建杭沙格水渠的镜头，学生们用自己的双手把原来废弃的小沟改成灌溉耕地的水渠了。对于中国青年学生，这是多么亲切！
    随着生产的发展，匈牙利人民生活迅速提高。你看，女工们在明亮整洁的车间愉快地劳动；地方企业的工人在舒适的食堂进餐；造船工人在俱乐部阅览、下棋；在巴拉顿湖畔每年有数千劳动者去那里休养。农村里，装有电灯和卫生设备的新房代替了破旧的茅屋。几乎全国农村，包括94％的一千人以下的村庄都有了图书馆。劳动人民在富丽堂皇的国家歌剧院看戏，最近十年来剧院的观众增加了二点五倍。这些生活片断告诉我们，匈牙利人民的生活一天天更加美好。
    当人们将要离开展览会场的时候，美丽的匈牙利风光使人们恋恋不舍。那雕着巨大狮头像的布达佩斯链子桥，奇妙的多瑙河夜景，巴拉顿湖畔的蒂汉半岛和帆船，还有隐现在山峦树丛中的利拉菲乐德宫殿饭店和美丽的民族服装。人们情不自禁地赞美这美丽如画的锦绣江山。如今这江山已经牢牢地掌握在匈牙利劳动人民手中，他们正在同社会主义兄弟国家携手前进，要把自己可爱的祖国建设得更加壮丽。
