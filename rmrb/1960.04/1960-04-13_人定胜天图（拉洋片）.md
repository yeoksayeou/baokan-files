Hey, everyone, look, everyone see,
This picture is truly wonderful,
It depicts the commune's heroes,
Displaying their prowess in overcoming natural disasters.
This commune is located in Huailai County, Hebei Province,
Its name is Wubao.
Last year, the heavens were unkind,
Disasters followed one after another, truly numerous,
The spring drought lasted more than fifty days, not to mention,
In the summer, floods surged,
More than a thousand mu of rice paddies were washed away,
Watching the golden grains float away with the water.
Frost and insect pests came again,
Three hailstorms damaged the crops! ...
Hey, disasters don't scare us,
Heroes don't bow their heads in the face of difficulties,
The commune's Party committee provides full leadership,
The members are united in overcoming the disaster with high confidence.
Look here, the sprayers are buzzing,
Streams of insecticide are sprayed towards the treetops;
Look there, the members are carrying water to fight the drought,
Some are sowing seeds, others are replanting seedlings;
Look here, heroes are fighting the flood,
Although the waves are high, they are not as high as the heroes' enthusiasm;
Look there, the carts are squeaking merrily,
Flood control materials are being transported. ...
The commune has tens of thousands of members,
Tens of thousands of hearts are of one mind:
No matter how great the natural disaster,
Increased production and a bumper harvest must be ensured.
Every member strives to be the best,
Expressing their bold statements:
What is lost by the river, find it on the mountain,
What is lost on the trees, find it underground!
Hey, man will conquer nature, it's not a lie,
The days of harvest have arrived.
Look at the orchards, a green expanse,
Round apples hang on the treetops;
Look at the grain, the granaries are full, unable to hold it all,
Each grain pile is higher than a mountain;
Look here, the fish are jumping in the bottom of the net,
Look there, the fat pigs in the pen are wagging their tails. ...
Every member is rejoicing,
What a scene of harvest, difficult to depict!
Everyone says the harvest of 1958 was particularly good,
Who knew the harvest in a disaster year would be even higher!
This all relies on the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery,
Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers all display their heroism.
Listen to the distant singing, loud and clear, endearing,
Hey, singing about the people's commune, infinitely good!

    人定胜天图（拉洋片）	缪印堂　画  易和元　词
    哎，大家看呀大家瞧，
    这一幅图画真美妙，
    画的是公社众好汉，
    战胜天灾逞英豪。
    这公社就在河北怀来县，
    它的名字叫五堡。
    在去年天公不作美，
    灾害接二连三真不少，
    春旱五十多天还不算，
    夏天里洪水又涌波涛，
    千多亩水稻被冲走，
    眼望着金黄谷粒随水漂。
    霜冻、虫灾又来了，
    三次雹灾打坏了庄苗！……
    哎，灾害把人吓不倒，
    英雄们困难面前不折腰，
    公社党委全力来领导，
    社员们齐心抗灾信心高。
    看这里喷雾器呼呼直叫，
    一股股杀虫药水射向树梢；
    看那里社员挑水把旱抗，
    有的撒种有的在补苗；
    看这里英雄和洪水在斗法，
    浪头虽高不及英雄干劲高；
    看那里马车吱吱叫得欢，
    防洪材料都运到。……
    公社社员有几万，
    几万个人心一条：
    不怕天灾有多大，
    增产丰收要确保。
    社员个个争上游，
    豪言壮语表一表：
    河边丢了山上找，
    树上丢了地下找！
    哎，人定胜天话不假，
    丰收的日子来到了。
    你看那果树成林一片绿，
    圆圆的苹果挂在树梢；
    你看那粮食满囤装不下，
    一个个的粮堆比山高；
    看这里鱼儿网底蹦蹦跳，
    看那里肥猪满圈把尾摇。……
    社员个个腾欢笑，
    好一幅丰收景象难画描！
    人都说五八年收成特别好，
    哪知道灾年的收成还要高！
    这都靠农林牧副渔全面发展，
    工农商学兵各显英豪。
    听远处歌声嘹亮惹人爱，
    哎，唱的是人民公社无限好！
