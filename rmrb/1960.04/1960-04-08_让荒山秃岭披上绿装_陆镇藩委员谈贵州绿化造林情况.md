Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the work report made by Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the Standing Committee, and I fully agree with and support the two reports made by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council at the Second National People's Congress, and I will resolutely implement them.

Now I will give a brief report on the development of afforestation in Guizhou Province during the all-round Great Leap Forward in forestry construction.

By mid-March, Guizhou had afforested 20 million mu, exceeding the annual afforestation plan.

Guizhou is a mountainous area inhabited by many ethnic groups. Before liberation, under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, fields, land and forests were occupied by landlords, and the excellent mountains and forests and rich resources were severely damaged. The forest area was less than 9% of the total land area. For many years, hardworking farmers lived in hunger and cold. After liberation, the working people stood up and became the masters of the mountains, forests, fields, and land. Since then, a new look has appeared in mountain area production. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our province are eager to change the backward situation of poverty, establish lofty ambitions, and shoulder the arduous and glorious task of developing, transforming, and building mountain areas. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction throughout the province, forestry construction has also seen great development. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and under the principle of taking grain as the key link, and implementing simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, forestry construction in our province has achieved even greater development, with extremely remarkable achievements. The afforestation area completed in 1958 and 1959 totaled more than 44 million mu, exceeding the sum of afforestation area from 1951 to 1957 by 6.2 times. Since last winter and this spring, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party regarding opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and practicing increased production and thrift, and on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, a magnificent tree-planting and afforestation movement with a larger scale, faster speed, and better quality has been launched. According to preliminary statistics, by mid-March, the province had completed 20 million mu of afforestation, successfully exceeding the annual plan.

In the mass tree-planting and afforestation movement, the experiences of fast-growing and high-yielding forests were conscientiously summarized and promoted. What is particularly encouraging is the miracle of eight-year-old Chinese fir in Jinping County. In the past, artificially cultivated Chinese fir trees could mature in eighteen years, and some people thought this was the fastest speed. However, in the Sanjiang People's Commune, eight-year-old Chinese fir trees appeared. Eight-year-old Chinese fir refers to the fact that from the time of seedling cultivation, after eight years of growth, the diameter of the Chinese fir tree at chest height reaches more than eighteen centimeters, which becomes Chinese fir that can be felled and used. The emergence of this new thing immediately received the attention of the Party and the people of the province. After preliminary research and summary, the main experiences of this fast-growing and high-yielding phenomenon are the six words: "good, deep, intercropping, protection, density, and nurturing." That is, good seeds and strong seedlings; deep plowing of the land to about one chi (approximately 1/3 of a meter); intercropping with agricultural crops for two or three years according to local conditions, using soil loosening and weeding to add fertilizer; preventing disasters such as insects and fire, and protecting the growth of trees; appropriate dense planting, about 400 plants per mu, thinning out a portion after five or six years; strengthening seedling nurturing, weeding and nurturing two or three times each year in the first three years to promote the growth of young forests. By doing this, the growth time of trees can be more than doubled compared to general afforestation, thus removing the "cap" of slow growth and low yield of trees. Through summarizing and promotion, the majority of forest farmers have initially mastered the experience of fast-growing and high-yielding forests. This allows for the large-scale cultivation of fast-growing and high-yielding forests, providing more timber for national construction more quickly to meet the needs of production and construction.

In the afforestation movement, the principle of taking grain as the key link was conscientiously implemented, the experience of intercropping between forests and grain was promoted, young forests were nurtured, intercropping between forests and grain was carried out on a large scale, and efforts were made to achieve a double harvest of forests and grain. In accordance with the principle of overall planning and adapting to local conditions, large-scale cultivation of corn mountains, bean mountains, millet mountains, potato mountains, and vegetable mountains, etc. was carried out, so that long-term interests and short-term benefits were closely combined. At present, the intercropping area of forests and grain in the province has reached more than 3.4 million mu, and active efforts are being made to expand the intercropping area to 10 million to 15 million mu. Jinping County, which started intercropping between forests and grain early and did a good job, has interplanted various food crops on more than 2,700 large and small hills, with an area of more than 780,000 mu, accounting for 1.6 times the county's cultivated land area. The broad masses want to turn all fast-growing and high-yielding forests into high-yielding grain slopes and win a double harvest of forests and grain. This not only comprehensively utilizes the land and rationally arranges the labor force for forestry and grain production, but also increases grain income and promotes the rapid growth and high yield of trees.

Adhering to putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements on a large scale is one of the fundamental reasons for the high-speed development of afforestation.

The reason why afforestation can develop at high speed, my personal experience is that the most fundamental reason is:

First, the leadership of the Party and the large-scale mass movement. In the vigorous afforestation movement carried out last winter and this spring, the province mobilized and organized 50% of the labor force to march towards barren hills and large-scale afforestation. At the same time, the shock-type afforestation movement of the entire people was closely combined with the organization of professional teams to carry out afforestation, so that the movement was not only vigorous but also solid. Therefore, not only is the afforestation area large, but the quality is also good. The Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, while carrying out mass movements on a large scale, organized a professional afforestation team of more than 18,000 people. The secretary of the prefectural party committee personally took charge and specifically led the professional team to work hard for 28 days on the barren hills around Kaili County, which were 25 kilometers long and wide, and fully implemented "contour strip" land preparation (i.e., digging into terraced fields), creating a large-scale high-yield forest of more than 127,000 mu. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee mobilized 300,000 afforestation troops to create a forest belt along both sides of the Qian-Gui Railway, on more than 900,000 mu of barren hills and wasteland over 200 kilometers long. In the afforestation movement, the masses were full of energy, men, women, old and young, all participated and strove to be the first and refused to lag behind. Yang Mogong, a 118-year-old Miao afforestation hero from Modizhai, Qianxi County, was named a provincial afforestation model in 1958. In 1959, he became even more advanced, collecting seeds and nurturing seedlings himself, planting more than 1,590 trees, and directly seeding 30 mu of Qinggangzi forest. Under the influence of this old hero, the forestry production of the Taojing Management Area was promoted to a new level. In addition, in the movement, there also appeared various named "Youth Forests," "Women's Forests," "Young Pioneer Forests," "Huang Zhong Forests," and "Secretary Forests," etc., totaling 4,048. These names and numbers themselves fully reflect the widespread and in-depth nature of the mass movement of large-scale tree planting and afforestation in Guizhou. All of these most fully demonstrate that under the centralized leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, and carrying out large-scale mass movements is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all socialist construction undertakings. The process of carrying out mass afforestation movements is also a process of continuously opposing right-leaning conservative thoughts. A few people once believed that "there are many mountains, little labor, large investment, and slow returns"; after proposing the policy of focusing on forestry and developing diversified operations, some people said that they could only "grasp one end and lose the other," believing that focusing on forestry would not allow for diversified operations, and that diversified operations would not allow for forestry to be the main focus. These right-leaning thoughts actually did not believe that forestry construction could develop rapidly with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and did not believe that mass movements must also be carried out on a large scale in forestry construction. After criticizing the above-mentioned right-leaning thoughts, and through the practice of the past two years, the facts have fully proven that under the leadership of the Party, adhering to carrying out mass movements on a large scale, forestry construction can not only make a Great Leap Forward, but can also continuously achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward.

Give full play to the superiority of the People's Communes and conscientiously implement the policy of walking on two legs.

Second, give full play to the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune of "large in size and collective in nature," and pay attention to implementing the spirit of "walking on two legs," which is to rely mainly on the People's Commune for afforestation and actively develop state-owned afforestation. Because the commune has a large scale, a high degree of collectivization, a wide range of operations, strong economic and material strength, and a large labor force, all of these provide extremely favorable conditions for large-scale and high-quality afforestation. For example, the Sanjiang People's Commune in Jinping County organized an afforestation army of 5,000 people to launch a comprehensive attack on barren hills and ridges. In the tense labor, the commune members happily said: "Plant ten thousand mu of forest this year, and it will become a treasure pot in the future." The soaring enthusiasm of the masses overcame the difficulties of severe cold and snow, and greened more than 220,000 mu of bare hills, planting tens of millions of Chinese fir, tung oil trees, tea oil trees, fruit trees, and nan bamboo. After communization, the commune established public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, freeing 4,800 women laborers in the commune from household chores to participate in production. 60% of the afforestation area in the commune was planted by women. After communization, it is possible to make overall arrangements for the use of the labor force, carry out large-scale afforestation movements during the slack farming season, and carry out unified planning based on natural conditions and national needs, comprehensively use land, rationally arrange the layout of forestry production, establish professional organizations, and carry out the cultivation of different trees in a concentrated and contiguous manner according to local conditions, and strengthen the management of the afforested young forests and existing forests to promote the rapid growth and high yield of trees, so as to ensure a continuous supply of timber and various forest products. They planted more Chinese fir trees in the areas with fertile soil and convenient water and land transportation in the mountain ravines, cultivated fruit trees on the hills near the mountains, planted more tung oil trees and tea oil trees in the yellow soil areas, and planted Qinggang, Machilus, pine trees, etc. in the steep slopes with thin soil on the top of the mountains. In this way, relying on the superior organization of the People's Commune, the afforestation cause has developed more planned. Not only afforestation, but also felling, transportation, and collection of mountain products are more coordinated. With the People's Commune, it is possible to more effectively mobilize and organize the masses to march towards a town, a railway, a highway, a river, or a mountain range, and carry out afforestation movements such as "thousand-mu trees" and "ten-thousand-mu forests," and it is possible to build various forest tree bases on a large scale, build commune-run forest farms, and develop high-yield forests on a large scale. At present, the large and concentrated base forests such as tea oil mountains, bamboo bays, Chinese fir forests, and flower and fruit gardens that have been built in the province have reached 1,482, high-yield forests 4.56 million mu, and commune-run forest farms 1,144; 4,683 forestry professional teams have been established. At the same time, some communes have initially realized the base of afforestation, forest farms, such as the ten communes in Jinping County, have set up 39 forest farms of various sizes. Many areas are building large-scale forestry bases and vigorously promoting the rapid growth and high yield of trees, striving towards the goals of base, forest farm, and high yield.

After the continuous Great Leap Forward of forestry construction in our province in 1958 and 1959, all aspects, including afforestation, timber production, forest chemical industry, forest sideline production, and forestry scientific research, have achieved comprehensive development and a comprehensive leap forward, and have achieved great results.

In the past ten years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have overcome countless difficulties and achieved great achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the future, we must more firmly hold high the red banner of invincible and insurmountable Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, establish lofty ambitions, develop the forestry construction cause in our province at a higher speed, and strive to build Guizhou into a "no mountain without green, all water clear, flowers fragrant in all seasons, trees shade all around, oil materials become lakes, fruits become mountains, timber can't be cut out, mulberry tea can't be harvested" beautiful and happy paradise.

The above speech is for correction.

I wish the meeting a complete success!

### 让荒山秃岭披上绿装  陆镇藩委员谈贵州绿化造林情况

专栏：

    让荒山秃岭披上绿装
    陆镇藩委员谈贵州绿化造林情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护陈叔通副主席代表常务委员会所作的工作报告，完全同意和拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理代表国务院在人大二次会议上所作的两个报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我就贵州省在林业建设事业全面大跃进中绿化造林的发展情况，作一简要汇报。
    到三月中旬，贵州已造林两千万亩，超额完成了全年造林计划
    贵州是一个多民族居住的山区。解放前，在国民党反动派残酷的统治下，田土山林都被地主霸占着，大好的山林，丰富的资源，横遭破坏，森林面积还不到土地总面积的9％。勤劳的农民长年过着饥寒交迫的日子。解放后，劳动人民翻了身，作了山林田地的主人，从此山区生产才出现了新的面貌。在党的领导下，我省各族人民迫切地要求改变贫穷落后的状况，树雄心、立大志，肩负起开发山区、改造山区、建设山区的艰巨而光荣的任务。随着全省工农业建设的大跃进，林业建设也同样地有了巨大的发展。特别是从1958年以来，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，在以粮为纲的方针下，实行了农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举，我省林业建设更获得了巨大的发展，成绩极为显著。1958、1959两年完成的造林面积共达四千四百多万亩，超过解放后1951年至1957年造林面积总和的六点二倍。去冬今春以来，在党的八届八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的号召下，又在过去两年连续大跃进的基础上，掀起了一个规模更大、速度更快、质量更好的大造林、造好林的波澜壮阔的植树造林运动，据初步统计，到3月中旬，全省造林完成了二千万亩，胜利地超额完成了全年计划。
    在群众性的植树造林运动中，认真总结和推广了林木速生丰产的经验。尤其振奋人心的，是在锦屏县出现了八年杉的奇迹。过去人工培植的杉木，十八年可以成材，有些人认为这即是最快的速度了，但是在三江人民公社却出现了八年杉。八年杉就是指自育苗之时算起，经过八个年头的生长期，杉树胸高直径达一十八厘米以上，这就成为可以砍伐使用的杉木了。这一新事物的出现，立即受到了党和全省人民的重视。经过初步的研究总结，这一速生丰产的主要经验是：良、深、间、保、密、抚六个字。即，良种壮苗；深耕土地一市尺左右；因地制宜地间作农作物二、三年，借助松土锄草，增添肥力；防止虫、火等灾害，保护林木生长；适当密植，每亩地四百株左右，经过五、六年后间伐一部分；加强幼苗抚育，在头三年每年锄草抚育二、三次，促进幼林生长。这样作，就能使林木比一般造林的生长时间快一倍以上，从而摘掉了林木慢生低产的“帽子”。通过总结、推广，使广大林农初步掌握了林木速生丰产的经验。这就可以大造特造其速生丰产林，更快地为国家建设提供更多的木材，以适应生产建设的需要。
    在造林运动中，认真地贯彻了以粮为纲的方针，推广了林粮间作的经验，开展幼林抚育，大搞林粮间作，争取林、粮双丰收。按照全面规划，因地制宜的原则，大搞苞谷山、豆类山、小米山、洋芋山、蔬菜山等，使长远利益与短期收益紧密地结合起来。现在，全省林粮间作面积已达三百四十多万亩，并正在积极努力，争取把间作面积扩展到一千万到一千五百万亩。林粮间作抓得早、抓得好的锦屏县，已在二千七百多个大大小小的山头上间种了各种粮食作物，面积达七十八万多亩，占全县耕地面积的一点六倍。广大群众要把所有的速生丰产林变成粮食丰产坡，夺取林粮双丰收。这就既综合利用了土地，合理地安排了林、粮生产的劳动力，又能增加粮食收入，促进林木的速生丰产。
    坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是造林事业高速度发展的根本原因之一
    造林事业之所以能高速度地发展，我个人体会最根本的原因是：
    一、党的领导，和大搞群众运动。在去冬今春开展的轰轰烈烈的造林运动中，全省就动员、组织了50％的劳动力向荒山进军，大造特造其林。同时，把全民出动的突击性的造林运动和组织专业队进行造林紧密地结合起来，使运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。所以，不仅造林的面积大，而且质量也好。黔东南苗族侗族自治州就在大搞群众运动的同时，组织了一万八千多人的造林专业队，州委书记亲自挂帅，具体领导这个专业队在凯里县城四周纵横二十五公里的荒山秃岭上，大干二十八天，全部实行了“等高带状”整地（即挖成梯土），营造了十二万七千多亩的大面积丰产林。黔南布依族苗族自治州委，动员三十万造林大军，沿着黔桂铁路两侧、在二百多公里长、九十多万亩的荒山荒地上营造了一条林带。在造林运动中，群众的干劲冲天，男女老幼，人人动手，个个争先，不甘落伍。黔西县摩底寨有一位一百一十八岁的苗族造林老英雄杨么公，他在1958年被评为省的造林模范后，在1959年就更加先进，他自采种自育苗，植树一千五百九十余株，直播青杠子造林三十亩。在这位老英雄的影响下，带动了桃井管理区林业生产的跃进。此外，在运动中还出现了各种命名的“青年林”、“妇女林”、“红领巾林”、
  “黄忠林”、“书记林”等四千零四十八个，这些命名和数字本身，充分地反映了贵州大搞植树造林的群众运动的广泛和深入。所有这些，都最充分地说明了在党的集中领导下，坚持政治挂帅，开展大规模的群众运动，是一切社会主义建设事业胜利的根本保证。在开展群众性的造林运动的过程中，也是一个不断反对右倾保守思想的过程。有少数人曾认为“山多，劳力少，投资大，收益慢”；在提出以林为主，开展多种经营的方针后，又有人说只能“抓一头，丢一头”，认为以林为主就不能开展多种经营，要开展多种经营就不能以林为主。这些右倾思想，实际上是不相信林业建设完全能够多快好省地高速度发展，不相信在林业建设上也必须大搞群众运动。经过对以上这些右倾思想的批判，和两年来的实践，事实充分证明了在党的领导下，坚持大搞群众运动，林业建设不仅能够大跃进，而且完全可以连续地取得全面的大跃进。
    充分发挥人民公社的优越性，并认真贯彻两条腿走路的方针
    二、充分发挥人民公社“一大二公”的无比优越性，注意贯彻了以依靠人民公社造林为主，积极发展国营造林的“两条腿走路”的精神。由于公社的规模大，公有化的程度高，经营范围广，经济物资力量雄厚，劳动力多，所有这些，给大造林、造好林提供了极为有利的条件。例如锦屏县的三江人民公社，组织五千人的造林大军，向荒山秃岭发起了全面的进攻，在紧张的劳动中，社员们愉快地说：“今年栽下万亩林，将来变成聚宝盆”。群众的冲天干劲，战胜了严寒风雪的困难，绿化了二十二万多亩童山秃岭，栽下了几千万株的杉木、油桐、油茶、果树和楠竹。在公社化后，公社办了公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园，使全社四千八百多个妇女劳动力从家务琐事中解放出来，参加了生产，全公社中有60％的造林面积就是妇女种植的。公社化后，既可以统筹安排使用劳动力，在农闲时间大搞造林运动，又能够根据自然条件和国家需要，进行统一规划，综合使用土地，合理安排林业生产的布局，设立专业组织，做到因地制宜地、集中成片地栽培不同的林木，并对已造幼林和现有森林加强管理，促使林木速生丰产，以保证源源不断地供应木材和各种林产品。他们在山冲土肥和水陆交通便利的地方，就多栽杉树，在近山矮坡就培植果木，在黄土壤的地区则多种油桐、油茶，在山顶陡坡土薄地方就栽青杠、麻栗、松树等。这样，依靠人民公社的优越组织，造林事业就更加有计划的发展了。不但是造林，而且在砍伐、运输、采集山货等方面也更加协调一致了。有了人民公社，就可以更有效地动员，组织群众向一个城镇、一条铁路、一条公路、一条河流、一座山脉进发，开展“千亩树”、“万亩林”的绿化造林运动，就可以大搞各种林木基地，大建社办林场，大搞丰产林。现在，全省已经营造的油茶山、竹子湾、杉木林、花果园等片大集中的基地林达一千四百八十二处，丰产林四百五十六万亩，社办林场一千一百四十四个；建立林业专业队四千六百八十三个。与此同时，有些公社已初步实现了造林基地化、林场化，如锦屏县的十个公社，就已办起了大小林场三十九个。很多地区正在大建林业基地，大搞林木速生丰产，向基地化、林场化、丰产化的目标奋进。
    我省的林业建设事业，经过1958、1959两年的连续大跃进，无论是造林、木材生产、林化工业、林副业生产、林业科学研究，都获得了全面发展和全面跃进，取得了巨大的成绩。
    在过去的十年中，我们在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，战胜了无数的困难，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的伟大成就。今后，我们更要坚定不移地高举战无不胜、攻无不克的毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝，树雄心立大志，以更高的速度来发展我省林业建设事业，力争在不久的将来，为把贵州建设成为一个“无山不翠，有水皆清，四季花香，四旁成荫，油料成湖，水果成山，木材砍不完，桑茶采不尽”的美好幸福的乐园而斗争。
    以上发言，请予指正。
    祝会议胜利成功！
