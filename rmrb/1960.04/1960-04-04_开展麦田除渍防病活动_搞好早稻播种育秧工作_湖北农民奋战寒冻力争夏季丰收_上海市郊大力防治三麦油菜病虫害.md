Hubei Farmers Fight Against Cold and Freezing to Strive for a Summer Harvest
Shanghai Suburbs Vigorously Prevent and Control Diseases and Insect Pests of Wheat and Rapeseed

(Dispatch from Wuhan, April 3rd) People's communes in Hubei Province are organizing broad masses of commune members to wage a major battle against cold waves, actively carrying out activities to prevent waterlogging, disease, and lodging, fiercely attacking the heading and flowering stage of barley and wheat, and firmly grasping the work of early rice sowing and seedling raising, striving for a bumper summer harvest this year.

The climate in Hubei Province has been very abnormal for a period of time. Since entering March, there has been continuous rain. On March 13, most areas experienced snowfall, and the temperature once dropped below zero degrees Celsius. In the northern and eastern regions of Xiangyang, Huanggang and other areas, the snow accumulated from four inches to half a foot. This has had a certain impact on the barley, wheat and rapeseed that are jointing, heading and flowering. In some areas, wheat, rapeseed and broad beans have successively suffered from diseases such as scab, sclerotinia, and root rot. In these areas, the broad masses of commune members, wearing straw raincoats and hats, braved the wind and rain to clear ditches and drain water. In Xinzhou County, Huanggang area, more than 50,000 commune members and cadres together cleared all the box ditches and surrounding ditches of more than 500,000 mu of wheat, barley and broad beans in two days. Nearly 300,000 mu of summer-harvested crops in Hongan County, after several days of hard work by the commune members, have basically achieved dry fields after the rain stopped. In many counties in the Wuhan area, due to the careful management of the commune members, the damaged wheat seedlings have mostly turned from yellow to green, and the lodged rapeseed has also been re-erected. In order to promote the rapid recovery of crops, commune members in Yunmeng and other counties have recently universally applied a nitrogen fertilizer to summer-harvested crops, and at the same time, according to the wet soil after rain and the weak disease resistance of crops, they have also applied a large amount of lime and plant ash.

This year's early rice sowing and seedling raising work in Hubei Province is also being carried out under the circumstances of unusually frequent cold waves. In mid-to-late March, the weather changed drastically, with alternating cold and heat, and temperatures in various places once dropped to around zero degrees Celsius. According to this situation, Party committees at all levels have deeply mobilized the broad masses of people, formulated various measures to determine the area and ensure the area, determine the quality and ensure the quality, and determine the time and ensure the time, striving to achieve full seedling emergence, prevent rotten seedlings, and ensure strong roots and eliminate weak seedlings. Xiao Jingman, the nationally famous model rice farmer and director of the Shishan People's Commune in Echeng County, in order to ensure that early rice emerges fully at one time, created the "soil pit germination method," which increased the germination rate of seeds from the original 80% to more than 95%, and also adopted the method of germinating during cold waves and sowing at the end of cold waves, cleverly avoiding the harm of cold waves to seedlings. Huanggang Prefecture has comprehensively promoted this advanced experience, effectively ensuring the quality of sowing, and the seedling emergence rate has also increased by more than 10% compared with the past. Various places have also universally promoted moist seedling fields, creating favorable conditions for seedlings to resist cold. After the early rice sowing in Jingzhou and Huanggang Prefectures, plant ash, fine sand and fine soil are universally used for covering to prevent cold and frost. At the same time, the people's communes in various places, in the spirit of "sowing one mu and managing one mu well," have comprehensively promoted the method of "special personnel leadership and professional management," selected cadres and commune members with a strong sense of responsibility and rich experience in seedling raising, organized management teams, and established a management responsibility system. Qichun County in the Huanggang area alone has drawn more than 12,000 laborers, organized more than 600 seedling protection teams, and achieved the goal of seeds falling into the mud and management being implemented. At present, the first batch of seeds that have fallen into the mud in various places has generally turned green and is growing vigorously.

(Dispatch from Shanghai, April 3rd) People's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai are actively carrying out a blitz campaign to prevent and control diseases and insect pests of wheat and rapeseed, in order to ensure a bumper harvest of summer-ripening crops.

Due to the warmer climate last winter, coupled with the recent continuous rain and high humidity, the occurrence of diseases and insect pests in wheat and rapeseed in the suburbs of Shanghai this year is generally half a month to a month earlier than in previous years, and the area of harm is also larger.

More than a month ago, the Rural Work Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, in the spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment, early treatment, and thorough treatment," deployed the work of disease and pest control in the eleven suburban counties. Subsequently, the counties held broadcast conferences and telephone conferences, issued combat calls, and started the battle to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming, Shanghai and other counties have successively dispatched teams of more than 10,000 to tens of thousands of people to spray medicine and carry out mass blitz prevention and control. According to incomplete statistics, 550,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed in five counties have been sprayed with medicine for prevention and control. Generally, the fields are sprayed with medicine once, and large-area high-yield fields are generally prevented and controlled two to three times. The Secretary of the Shanghai County Party Committee took the lead, personally went to the front line to direct the battle, and sprayed medicine to eliminate insects with the commune members. On March 23, more than 10,000 commune members set out before dawn to spray "666" powder in the wheat fields, and carried out a blitz prevention and control of nearly 30,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed. The communes in Chuansha County organized mass blitzes, and the entire county quickly carried out two comprehensive prevention and control measures. In order to improve the efficiency of prevention and control, Huinan Commune in Nanhui County successfully trial-produced the "Nanhui Type 1 Cannon Sprayer," which can spray more than half a mu in one shot, and is four and a half times more efficient than a hand-operated sprayer.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of summer-ripening crops, the commercial departments in various counties actively cooperate with the action. According to the principle of "using both indigenous and foreign methods and taking materials locally," the supply and marketing cooperative of Gu Road Commune in Chuansha County manufactured more than 35,000 jin of local pesticides, and prepared sufficient "666," "223" and other pesticides.

At present, on the basis of winning the previous stage of the blitz campaign to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, the people of various counties are in high spirits, actively preparing pesticides and agricultural machinery, and are further improving their teams and training technical forces to meet the greater battle when the temperature rises.

    开展麦田除渍防病活动　搞好早稻播种育秧工作
    湖北农民奋战寒冻力争夏季丰收
    上海市郊大力防治三麦油菜病虫害
    本报武汉3日电　湖北各人民公社组织广大社员大战寒潮，积极开展防渍、防病、防倒伏活动，猛攻大麦、小麦抽穗关，狠抓早稻的播种、育秧工作，力争今年夏季大丰收。
    湖北省前一段期间气候很不正常。进入3月以来，阴雨连绵。3月13日，大部地区普遍降雪，气温一度降到摄氏零度以下。北部和东部地区的襄阳、黄冈等专区积雪四寸到半尺左右。这样，就使正在拔节孕穗的大、小麦和抽苔开花的油菜受到一定影响。某些地区的小麦、油菜和蚕豆陆续发生赤霉病、菌核病、根腐病等病害。这些地区的广大社员，披蓑戴斗笠，冒着风雨，清沟排渍。黄冈地区的新洲县五万多名社员跟干部一道，两天就把五十多万亩小麦、大麦、蚕豆的厢沟、围沟通通清理了一遍。红安县近三十万亩夏收作物，经过社员几天奋战，基本做到了雨止田干。武汉地区许多县，由于社员的细心料理，受害的麦苗大都由黄转青，倒伏了的油菜也都重新扶起。为了促使作物迅速恢复生机，云梦等县的社员们最近对夏收作物普遍追施了一次氮肥，同时，根据雨后土湿，作物抗病力弱的情况，还追施了大量的石灰和草木灰。
    今年湖北省的早稻播种、育秧工作，也是在寒潮异常频繁的情况下进行的。3月中、下旬，晴雨变化多端，冷热反复不定，各地气温曾一度下降到摄氏零度上下。根据这一情况，各级党委深入地发动广大群众，制订了定面积、保面积，定质量、保质量，定时间、保时间的各种措施，力争做到粒粒成苗，防止烂秧；根根粗壮，消灭脚秧。全国著名的水稻模范鄂城县石山人民公社社长萧敬满，为了保证早稻一次全苗，创造了“土坑催芽法”，使种子的发芽率从原来的80％提高到95％以上，还采取了寒潮期间催芽、寒潮尾期播种的办法，巧妙地避开了寒潮对秧苗的危害。黄冈专区全面地推广了这个先进经验，有效地保证了播种质量，成苗率也比过去提高10％以上。各地还普遍地推广了湿润秧田，为秧苗抗寒创造了有利条件。荆州、黄冈两专区早稻播种后，普遍用草木灰、细沙、细土进行复盖，以防寒、防冻。同时，各地人民公社还本着“播种一亩，管好一亩”的精神，全面地推行了“专人领导、专业管理”的方法，选拔了责任心强、育秧经验丰富的干部、社员，组织了管理小组，建立了管理责任制度。仅黄冈地区的蕲春县就抽出了一万二千多个劳动力，组织了六百多个护秧小组，做到了种子落泥，管理落实。目前，各地第一批落泥的种子，已普遍现青，生长茁壮。
    本报上海3日电　上海市郊各人民公社积极开展防治三麦、油菜病虫害的突击运动，以确保夏熟作物的大丰收。
    由于去冬气候较暖，加上最近阴雨连绵，湿度大，上海市郊今年三麦油菜发生的病虫害一般比往年提早半个月到一个月，为害的面积也较大。
    还在一个多月前，中共上海市委农村工作委员会就以“防重于治、治早、治了”的精神，对郊区十一个县防治病虫害工作作了部署。接着，各县召开广播大会，电话会议，发出战斗号召，开始防治病虫害的战斗。南汇、川沙、宝山、崇明、上海等县已先后出动一万多人到几万人的喷药队伍，进行群众性的突击防治。据不完全统计，五个县已经有五十五万亩三麦油菜经过喷药防治，一般田喷药一次，大面积丰产片普遍防治二到三次。上海县县委书记带头，亲临前线指挥战斗，与社员一起喷药除虫。3月23日有一万多名社员在天未亮就出动，在麦田里喷“六六六”粉，突击防治了近三万亩三麦油菜。川沙县各公社组织群众突击，全县迅速地进行了二次全面防治。南汇县惠南公社为了提高防治工效，试制成功“南汇一型火炮喷雾器”，一炮能喷射半亩多，比手摇喷雾器效率提高四倍半。
    为了保证夏熟作物大丰收，各县商业部门积极配合行动。川沙县顾路公社供销部根据“土洋并举就地取材”的方针，制造三万五千多斤土农药，并准备了足够的“六六六”、“二二三”等农药。
    目前，各县人民在取得前一阶段突击防治病虫害的胜利基础上，情绪格外高涨，积极准备农药和药械，正进一步健全队伍，训练技术力量，以迎接气温上升时更大的战斗。
