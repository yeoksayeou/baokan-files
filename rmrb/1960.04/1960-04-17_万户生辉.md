Title: Ten Thousand Homes Radiate

　　I loudly recite Bai Juyi's and Han Hong's verses: "The scenery of Wu Garden is beautiful in all four seasons," and "In the spring city, flowers fly everywhere."

　　But I think, even such beautiful verses can hardly describe one ten-thousandth of the splendor of our garden in full bloom today.

　　In fact, it is rather clumsy to use flowers to describe people, because people are much more beautiful and vibrant than flowers.

　　Walking down the street, one can see many signs: this is a street factory of the urban people's commune, that is a public canteen of the urban people's commune, the one above is a nursery, and the next building is a life service station; the red characters of "Urban People's Commune" shine brightly under the spring sun.

　　In our courtyard, there is an old woman, over fifty years old, very healthy. In the past, she stayed at home taking care of her four grandsons. There were many children in the courtyard, and they often fought. The old woman loved her own children and always stood by her grandsons, whether they were right or wrong, and sometimes even argued with other children. But now, she has become the director of the street nursery. Every day after dinner, she talks about "our nursery," eagerly sharing the new things in the nursery. Several times she even carried other people's children from the nursery back home. When others asked her, she would say, "Let me tell you, these children of ours are..."

　　In the past, people only said, "mine," "yours," but now they say, "ours," "ours" all the time. Changing from the former to the latter is a significant change.

　　Is this just a few ordinary words? No, this is a tremendous leap in people's mental outlook and thoughts and feelings.

　　In the past, people were confined within the high walls of houses. Looking up, they only saw the four-cornered sky above the high walls; looking down, they only saw pots and bowls, firewood, rice, oil, and salt. They lived next to each other, but they never interacted with each other until they died, and when they did interact, they often quarreled and fought. The dust left over from the old society still clung to people's thoughts and consciousness to some extent.

　　Lu Xun at that time felt that he was "surrounded by invisible high walls," isolating him into a "lonely self," making him "feel suffocated"; he had long hoped that the next generation "should have a new life, one that we have never lived." But Lu Xun's hope was only a hope "in a haze" in his time. (See "Hometown")

　　"New life," like a myriad of rays of dawn, has now appeared before us, a "new life" that we "have never lived" in the past. People have emerged from that dark little world, clearing away those selfish and narrow old ideas. People are united in the big family of socialist collective, heart to heart, shoulder to shoulder, propelling our society forward.

　　Round-faced children call strangers "Mommy" and "Grandma," and kind-hearted grandmothers treat other people's children as their own; Aunt Zhang voluntarily sews and washes clothes for you, and Sister Li helps you clean the house; men and women, young and old, whether they are surnamed Huang or Zhao, are all members of our family.

　　In the past, on the corners of old houses, there was mostly a small wooden plaque with the words "Good fortune shines" and "Generate wealth for me," but after "shining" for thousands of years and "generating" for a long time, they still lived a bitter and miserable life in the midst of wind and rain. But now, it is truly "good fortune shines" and "ten thousand homes radiate." Under the illumination of the Party—this star of immense light—and under the encouragement of the three red flags, thousands of households are organized into the big family of urban people's communes, full of vigor and radiating the light of communist thought. Everyone is twisted into a rope, helping each other and moving forward hand in hand.

    我高声朗读白居易和韩翃的诗句：“吴苑四时风景好”，“春城无处不飞花”。
    但我想，即使是这般美丽的诗句，对我们今天的满园春色来说，也很难描画其万一。
    其实，用花来形容人是颇为拙笨的，因为，人比花要美丽得多，蓬勃得多。
    走上街去，就能看到许多牌子，这是城市人民公社街道工厂，那是城市人民公社公共食堂，上一间是托儿所，下一栋是生活服务站；“城市人民公社”红色的大字在春天的阳光照耀下，闪闪发光。
    在我们院子里，有一个老妈妈，五十多岁，人很硬朗，过去在家带着四个孙子，院子里孩子多，经常打架，老妈妈疼爱自己的孩子，有理无理总是站在孙子这一边，有时还出头和别的孩子争吵起来。但如今，却当上了街道托儿所主任，每天晚饭后回来，也是“我们托儿所”“我们托儿所”地，争着讲说所里的新事。有几次她还背起所里别家的孩子回来，别人问她，她就说：“我告诉你，我们的这些孩子哪……”
    从前人们只是说：“我的”“你的”，现在却口口声声地叫：“我们的”“我们的”。由前者变为后者，真是一个不小的变化。
    这仅只是嘴边的句把平常话么？不是的，这是人们精神面貌、思想感情上的巨大飞跃。
    从前，人给关在屋子的高墙中，仰头，看见的只是高墙上的四角天空，低头，摆在面前的只是锅头碗盏，柴米油盐。毗邻而居，但老死不相往来，而一往来，又常常你争我吵；旧社会遗留下来的灰尘，还多多少少地沾附在人们的思想意识里。
    鲁迅那时是感到他自己“四面有看不见的高墙”，将他“隔成孤身”，使他“气闷”；他早就希望后一代“应该有新的生活，为我们所未经生活过的。”但鲁迅的希望，在他活着的那个时代里，只是“在朦胧中”的希望而已。（见“故乡”）
    “新的生活”，像霞光万道，在我们面前如今是出现了过去“所未经生活过的”“新的生活”。人们是从那阴暗的小天地里钻了出来，清除那些自私狭隘的旧观念，人们团聚在社会主义集体的大家庭中，心连着心，肩并着肩，推动我们的社会滚滚向前。
    圆脸的孩子对陌生的人叫妈妈叫奶奶，好心的奶奶将别人的孩子当作自己的孩子；张家大娘自动的替你缝洗衣服，李家嫂子替你打扫屋子；男女老少，姓黄姓赵，都是我们家里人。
    过去的旧屋角上，大都钉着一块小木牌，写着“吉星高照”“对我生财”这几个字，但“照”了几千年，“对”了许多时候，还是在风雨飘摇中，过那酸辛惨苦的日子。如今呢，真的是“吉星高照”，“万户生辉”了，在党——这一颗光芒万丈的吉星照耀之下，在三面红旗鼓舞之下，千家万户组织到城市人民公社的大家庭中来，生气勃勃，发出了共产主义思想的光辉，大家扭成了一股绳，你帮我助，携手前进。
