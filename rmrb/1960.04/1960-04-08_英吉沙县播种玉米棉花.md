Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Telegram: The people of Yingjisha County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, are mobilizing all their efforts to overcome the spring sowing hurdle.

Last year, Yingjisha County achieved an average corn yield of 705 jin per mu, earning the red flag for high corn yields in Xinjiang. This year, in order to achieve the goal of exceeding 1,000 jin per mu for corn and doubling cotton production, the people of all ethnic groups in the county have made full preparations for spring sowing. In terms of water conservancy, the county's water storage has increased by more than double compared to last year, and various crops can be irrigated up to four times. All 120,000 mu of corn land and 28,000 mu of cotton land in the county have been deeply ploughed and have reached the standard of garden-style cultivation, with each mu receiving 7,000 jin of base fertilizer. Corn and cotton seeds have also been carefully selected, and various production tools have been fully prepared.

90% of the cadres in the county have gone deep into the spring sowing front to participate in and direct production. Many of them have also established high-yield experimental fields in corn high-yield plots in various communes. Cooks in many communes and production teams are even delivering tea and meals to the fields. Iron and wood workers from various farm tool factories are also bringing their tools to the fields to repair farm tools on the spot. Large-scale collaboration is also being carried out in spring sowing. For example, the Wuqia Commune, located in the upper reaches of the Kucha mountain river, saw that the Heizi Commune in the lower reaches had no water for irrigation in its white fields, so it took the initiative to release water, allowing the Heizi Commune to carry out a concentrated pre-sowing irrigation.

    英吉沙县播种玉米棉花
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区英吉沙县全民总动员猛攻春播关。
    英吉沙县去年玉米平均亩产七百零五斤，获得了新疆玉米高额丰产的红旗。今年全县各族人民为了实现玉米突破千斤关，棉花翻一番的奋斗目标，对春播工作进行了充分准备。在水利方面，全县的蓄水量比去年增加了一倍多，各种作物可灌到四水。全县的十二万亩玉米地和二万八千亩棉花地，全部经过深翻，并且都达到了园田化的标准，每亩施的底肥也达到七千斤，玉米和棉花种子也都经过精选，各种生产工具也准备得很齐全。
    全县90％的干部都深入到春播战线，参加生产指挥生产，其中许多干部还在各个公社的玉米丰产方里建立了高产试验田；许多公社和生产队的炊事员还做到送茶送饭到田。各农具厂的铁、木工人也带家具到地头，就地修补农具。各地在春播中还开展了大协作。如地居苦山大河上游的乌恰公社，看到下游黑孜公社白地无水灌溉，就主动的让出水来，使黑孜公社突击增灌了播前水。
