The capital city and relevant departments of Shanxi Province, in order to rescue the sixty-one migrant workers on the verge of death from food poisoning in the "Pinglu Incident," displayed a highly communist spirit, deeply moving and educating the people of the whole country. But how did the sixty-one migrant workers get poisoned? Now the truth is out: it was a sabotage carried out by counter-revolutionaries and landlord elements, who put arsenic in the rice pot of the public canteen, intending to poison the migrant workers eating in the canteen. These two criminals have now been executed according to law. What does this counter-revolutionary sabotage incident illustrate?

This issue should be viewed from the perspective of class struggle. Who were the criminals who poisoned the sixty-one migrant workers? One was Zhang Decai, a Kuomintang secret service agent and leader of an intelligence group under the Japanese puppet army, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan's bandit gang, a counter-revolutionary who murdered the chairman of the Shenrenjian Farmers' Association in Pinglu County and arrested and tortured revolutionary masses. The other was Hui Shenwa, a landlord element who had cruelly exploited farmers and harbored deep hatred for the revolution. Some people believe that after several movements to eliminate and suppress counter-revolutionaries, there are no counter-revolutionaries left, or even if there are a few, they are not worth worrying about; that landlord class elements have all been transformed for the better after long-term reformation, and there is no need to be more vigilant, strengthen education, and reform them. The "Pinglu Incident" is a powerful negation of this view. Although the counter-revolutionary Zhang Decai had serious historical crimes, owed blood debts, and hid his history, disguised as a good person, and remained hidden in the countryside and factories for ten years after liberation, persisting in being an enemy of the people. After this counter-revolutionary was discovered in 1958, the government, in the spirit of leniency towards past crimes, sentenced him only to three years of control, hoping that he would repent and turn over a new leaf. But this incorrigible counter-revolutionary became even more hostile to the revolution and the people, finally poisoning the sixty-one migrant workers. The landlord class element Hui Shenwa had cruelly exploited and oppressed the masses, and after liberation, the masses, in accordance with the Party's policy, asked him to work hard and become a self-reliant laborer. But Hui Shenwa harbored deep hatred for the revolution and the people, and colluded with the counter-revolutionary Zhang Decai to carry out the criminal activity of poisoning the migrant workers.

Now, our country's political and economic situation is unprecedentedly good, and the people's democratic dictatorship is unprecedentedly consolidated. Counter-revolutionaries are indeed only a very small minority. This is the main and fundamental situation. To fail to see this and exaggerate the enemy's situation is not in line with reality. In recent years, the broad masses of people, in accordance with the Party's policies, have carried out supervision, reformation, and ideological education work on landlord elements, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements, as well as bourgeois rightist elements. These people originally constituted only a small minority of the population, and they have greatly differentiated, with many people willing to accept reformation and some genuinely repenting and being transformed into self-reliant laborers. However, the "Pinglu Incident" tells us that counter-revolutionaries have not been completely eliminated. These extremely few counter-revolutionaries are all stubbornly hostile to the people. They often disguise themselves and infiltrate our ranks, taking advantage of people's complacency to carry out vicious sabotage. The counter-revolutionary Zhang Decai was like this, hiding in factories and the countryside for ten years, and even continuing to be an enemy of the people during the period of control, carrying out such criminal sabotage. We must be highly vigilant against this very small number of counter-revolutionaries. Although they are small in number, they are extremely harmful, and we must not be complacent in the slightest.

The incident of the Pinglu migrant workers being poisoned clearly shows that eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionaries, as well as criminals such as fraud, theft, and hooliganism, is still a long-term struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated will not give up, and they will definitely seize the opportunity to make trouble. The US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are still constantly sending special agents to our place to carry out sabotage activities. Even if the original counter-revolutionaries are eliminated, some new counter-revolutionaries may appear. If we lose our vigilance, we will be greatly deceived and suffer great losses. Wherever counter-revolutionaries appear to make trouble, they should be resolutely eliminated." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") We should firmly remember these words of Comrade Mao Zedong. While carrying out economic construction at a high speed with the Great Leap Forward, we must continue to raise revolutionary vigilance, strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, continue to resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, strengthen the supervision, reformation, and education of landlord elements, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, bad elements, and bourgeois rightist elements who have been overthrown, and severely suppress those die-hard elements among them who dare to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, so as to ensure social security and guarantee the smooth progress of the great socialist construction cause.

### “平陆事件”的教训

    “平陆事件”的教训
    首都和山西省的有关方面，为了抢救“平陆事件”食物中毒命在垂危的六十一位民工，发扬了高度的共产主义风格的事迹，使全国人民受了很大的感动和教育。但是六十一位民工是怎样中毒的？现在真相大白了，原来是反革命和地主分子进行的暗害，他们把砒霜下在公共食堂的饭锅里，要把在食堂吃饭的民工毒死。这两个凶犯现在已经依法处决了。这个反革命暗害事件说明了什么呢？
    应当从阶级斗争的观点来观察这个问题。毒害六十一位民工的罪犯是什么人呢？一个是日伪军和蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮分子，敌人的情报组长，杀害过我平陆县圣人涧农会主席、逮捕和拷打过革命群众的反革命分子张德才。一个是曾经残酷地剥削过农民，对革命抱着刻骨仇恨的地主分子回申娃。有些人认为：经过几次的肃清反革命和镇压反革命运动，反革命分子已经没有了，即使有一些，也不足为害了；地主阶级分子经过长期改造，也统统都已经变好了，用不着再对他们提高警惕，加强教育和改造了。“平陆事件”是对这种观点的一个有力的否定。反革命分子张德才虽然有严重的历史罪恶，负有血债，并且在解放后，隐瞒历史，伪装好人，混藏在农村和工厂中达十年之久，坚持与人民为敌。1958年这个反革命分子被查出后，政府本着对过去的罪行从宽处理的政策精神，只判处了他三年管制，希望他悔罪向善，重新作人。但是这个怙恶不悛的反革命分子反而对革命和人民更加仇视。终于对六十一位民工下了毒手。地主阶级分子回申娃曾经残酷地剥削和欺压过人民群众，解放后群众按照党的政策，要他好好劳动，作一个自食其力的劳动者。但是回申娃对革命和人民却抱着刻骨仇恨，伙同反革命分子张德才一起进行了毒害民工的罪恶活动。
    现在，我们国家的政治经济形势空前良好，人民民主专政空前巩固，反革命分子确实只有极少数了。这是主要的基本的情况，看不到这点，夸大敌情是不符合实际情况的。几年来，广大人民群众按照党的政策对地主分子，富农分子，反革命分子和坏分子，以及资产阶级右派分子，进行了监督改造和思想教育工作，这些人原来就只占人口的极少数，又起了很大分化，许多人愿意接受改造，有些确实真诚悔罪，并且被改造成了自食其力的劳动者。但是，“平陆事件”告诉我们，反革命分子并没有完全肃清。这些极少数的反革命分子，都是死心塌地地同人民为敌的。他们往往伪装起来，混入我们的队伍，当人们麻痹大意的时候，乘机进行凶恶破坏。反革命分子张德才就是这样先后藏在工厂和农村中达十年之久，并且竟然在管制期间继续与人民为敌，进行了这种罪恶破坏。对这种为数极少的反革命分子，必须提高警惕。他们人数虽少，但为害极大，绝不能有丝毫麻痹大意。
    平陆民工受毒害的事件清楚地表明，肃清残余的反革命分子，以及诈骗、盗窃、流氓等犯罪分子，仍然是一个长期的斗争。毛泽东同志曾经说：“没有肃清的暗藏的反革命分子是不会死心的，他们必定要乘机捣乱。美帝国主义者和蒋介石集团经常还在派遣特务到我们这里来进行破坏活动。原有的反革命分子肃清了，还可能出现一些新的反革命分子。如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。不管什么地方出现反革命分子捣乱，就应当坚决消灭他。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）我们应当牢牢记住毛泽东同志的这些话，在以大跃进的高速度进行经济建设的同时，还要继续提高革命的警惕性。加强人民民主专政，继续坚决肃清一切反革命分子，加强对已经被打倒的地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子、坏分子和资产阶级右派分子的监督改造和教育，对其中敢于进行反革命活动的死硬分子，必须加以严厉的镇压，以保障社会安全，保证伟大的社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
