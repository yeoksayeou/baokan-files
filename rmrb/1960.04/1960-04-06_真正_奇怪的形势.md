    Truly “Strange Situation”
    Ziyue
    When U.S. Secretary of State Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 22, he admitted that three dictatorial regimes still remained in Latin America—Nicaragua, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic, and he announced that the United States would continue to provide them with military assistance. But a few days later, U.S. State Department press officer White changed the statement, saying that it was difficult to distinguish which regimes in Latin America were dictatorial regimes, and Nicaragua should be removed from the list of dictatorial regimes. He also stated that Herter had asked him to make this correction.
    Herter apparently felt he had misspoke. This was not because these notorious dictatorial regimes had suddenly undergone any changes in a few days; it was because Herter's words had created an open "disagreement" with Eisenhower's remarks. When Eisenhower visited South America, he tried his best to dispel people's "misunderstanding" about the U.S. supporting dictators, and he flatly said: "It is ridiculous to say that the United States supports dictators. It is certain that no country loves freedom more than the United States." But the Secretary of State slapped the President in the face, making the President a ridiculous liar. This is why White had to come out to correct it.
    White's defense was that "in recent years, Latin America has made significant progress towards democracy," and Nicaragua has "achieved" "good results" in "efforts to establish representative democracy." This is in line with Eisenhower's statement: "We (referring to the U.S. government) are doing our best to foster freedom and representative democracy throughout this hemisphere." In fact, Herter also made the same defense when he testified, saying that Nicaragua and Paraguay "are trying to democratize these two countries," but the opposition parties in these two countries refused to participate in the elections, so "there is 'a rather strange situation' in Nicaragua and Paraguay." It turns out that it is not Herter who finds it "difficult to distinguish" which are dictatorial regimes, but those who oppose dictatorship.
    But what kind of "rather strange situation" is this after all? Indeed, the tyrants of Nicaragua and Paraguay have successively announced the holding of "free elections," and Paraguay has repeatedly announced the dates of the elections. At the same time, the United States is indeed "fostering freedom" in these two dictatorial countries. The Paraguayan "Unidad" pointed out that the Paraguayan elections were "concocted in the U.S. Embassy." However, the Paraguayan opposition parties—the Liberal Party and the February Party—which Herter accused of "refusing to participate in the elections," had long been deprived of their legal rights in the country and had to go into exile in Argentina. The entire Paraguay is under martial law, with only torture and forced labor, and no freedom for the people. The situation in Nicaragua is the same. In order to fight for freedom and democracy, the opposition has no choice but to take up arms and carry out guerrilla warfare.
    When the Nicaraguan tyrant Somoza announced the holding of "free elections," he said, "The next election will be a free election held with ballots instead of bullets," and he accused the opposition of "trying to use bullets to deal with my method of holding votes." But Somoza also announced that he had "absolutely no intention" of stepping down, and in order to guarantee this, he would make the "laws" that currently maintain the dictatorial rule "more strictly" enforced. Therefore, as the opposition parties in Nicaragua and Paraguay have revealed, the U.S. trick of "fostering freedom" is to use "free elections" to decorate the dictatorial gallows with "democracy," and its purpose is to "legitimately" eliminate the people's uprisings and prevent the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle sweeping Latin America. This is the whole truth about the U.S.'s "cultivating freedom and representative democracy."
    However, Eisenhower's attempt to dispel people's "misunderstanding" about the U.S. supporting dictators, and Herter and White's attempt to defend the dictators, are all in vain. The U.S. not only fosters and supports dictators in Latin America, but also in other regions. The facts are there, and even Sulzberger, the famous New York Times correspondent in Washington, had to admit in his book "What's Wrong with American Foreign Policy": in the "free world" led by the United States, "forty-nine are either under dictatorial regimes or under oligarchic rule." He also asked: "Why do we deceive ourselves?" It can be seen that there is no "misunderstanding" here. Moreover, while Sulzberger pointed out "What's Wrong with American Foreign Policy," he still advocated in another article published in the New York Times that the United States should continue to instigate military coups in Asia and Africa to establish military dictatorship regimes to resist the storm of national democratic revolution. He said: "The military can become a benevolent social force." Isn't the United States doing this now?
    It's just that "rather strange situations" are appearing everywhere, making Washington's "freedom" and "democracy" guardians increasingly uneasy. When the Nicaraguan people ignited the flames of the anti-dictatorial uprising, Somoza couldn't help but exclaim: "The situation seems a bit bad." The United States uses bayonets and dollars to foster and support reactionary dictatorial regimes, while the people of all countries reject any "gracious" and "ordained" "democracy." The Cuban people are an example. They not only resolutely overthrew the Batista dictatorial regime armed to the teeth by the United States, but also resolutely opposed the U.S. interference and Batista's restoration conspiracy after the victory of the revolution. Whether it is the U.S.'s "cultivating freedom" or the ballots extended from the bloody hands of the likes of Somoza, they cannot stop the wave of national democratic revolution, wave after wave, higher and higher. In fact, there is nothing strange about the development of this situation.

    真正“奇怪的形势”
    子悦
    美国国务卿赫脱3月22日在参院外委会作证时承认，拉丁美洲还残存着三个独裁政权——尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和多米尼加，他并宣布美国将继续为它们提供军事援助。但过了几天，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特改变了说法，他说，很难分清到底拉丁美洲的哪一些政权是独裁政权，尼加拉瓜就应该从独裁政权的名单中剔除。他还声明，这是赫脱要他作这样的纠正的。
    赫脱显然感到自己失言了。这不是因为这些臭名远扬的独裁政权，忽然在几天之内发生了什么变化；而是因为赫脱的话同艾森豪威尔的言论发生了公开的“分歧”。艾森豪威尔在访问南美时曾为了消除人们对美国支持独裁者的“误解”，卖尽了力气，他这样断然说：“有人说美国支持独裁者，这是荒唐可笑的。肯定说，没有任何国家比美国更爱自由。”可是国务卿居然打了总统的耳光，使总统变成荒唐可笑的谎言家。这就是怀特不得不出来纠正的原因。
    怀特的辩解是，“最近几年来，拉丁美洲有朝着民主方向前进的显著进步”，而尼加拉瓜就在“建立代议制民主的努力”中“取得”了“良好的成就。”这是符合艾森豪威尔的说法的：“我们（指美国政府）尽我们的最大力量在本半球各地培育自由和代议制民主。”其实，赫脱在作证时也作过同样的辩解，他说，尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭“正在企图使这两个国家民主化”，但这两个国家的反对派拒绝参加选举，因而“在尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭存在着‘一种相当奇怪的形势’”。原来，“难于分清”哪些是独裁政权的，不是赫脱，而是反对独裁的人。
    但是，到底这是一种怎么样的“相当奇怪的形势”呢？的确，尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭的暴君都先后宣布举行“自由选举”，巴拉圭还一再宣布过选举的日期。同时，美国也的确在这两个独裁国家里“培育自由”。巴拉圭“团结报”曾指出，巴拉圭的选举是“在美国大使馆里泡制出来的”。然而被赫脱指责为“拒绝参加选举”的巴拉圭的反对派——自由党和二月党，在国内早已被剥夺了合法权利，不得不流亡在阿根廷。整个巴拉圭都处于戒严状态，只有酷刑和劳役，而没有任何人民的自由。尼加拉瓜的情况也是如此，反对派为了争取自由和民主，除了拿起武器，进行游击战，别无他途。
    尼加拉瓜的暴君索摩查在宣布举行“自由选举”时说，“下次选举将是一次用选票而不是用子弹举行的自由选举”，他指责反对派“正在企图使用子弹的方法来对付我的举行投票的方法”。但索摩查同时宣布，他“绝对无意”下台，而为了保证这一点，他将使目前维持独裁统治的“法律”执行得“更加严厉”。因此，正如尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭的反对派所揭露的，美国“培育自由”的把戏是，以“自由选举”来为独裁的绞架作“民主”的装饰，其目的是“合法”地消灭人民的起义，阻止席卷拉丁美洲的反美反独裁斗争的浪潮。这就是美国“培育自由和代议制民主”的全部真相。
    然而，艾森豪威尔想消除人们对美国支持独裁者的“误解”，赫脱和怀特想为独裁者进行辩解，都是白费气力。美国不仅在拉丁美洲扶植和支持独裁者，在其他地区也是如此。事实俱在，连“纽约时报”驻华盛顿的著名记者苏兹贝格也不得不在“美国外交政策的错误何在”一书中承认：在美国领导的“自由世界”中，“有四十九个不是在独裁政权的统治下，就是在寡头政治的统治下。”他还问道：“我们为什么要自欺欺人呢？”可见这里决没有什么“误解”。而且苏兹贝格在指出“美国外交政策的错误何在”的同时，在另一篇登在“纽约时报”的文章中，仍然鼓吹美国要在亚非地区继续策动军事政变，建立军事独裁政权来抵挡民族民主革命的风暴。他说：“军人可以成为仁慈的社会力量”。现在，美国不正是在这样做吗？
    只是，“相当奇怪的形势”到处出现，使得华盛顿的“自由”“民主”卫士们日益感到坐立不安。当尼加拉瓜人民点燃了反独裁起义的烽火的时候，索摩查就不禁惊呼：“情况似乎有些糟。”美国用刺刀和美元扶植和支持反动独裁政权，而各国人民却拒绝任何“恩赐”的和“钦定”的“民主”。古巴人民就是榜样，他们不仅坚决推翻了由美国武装到牙齿的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，而且在革命胜利后，坚决反对美国的干涉和巴蒂斯塔的复辟阴谋。美国的“培育自由”也好，从索摩查之流的血腥的手里伸出的选票也好，都不能阻挡一浪推一浪，一浪高一浪的民族民主革命浪潮。其实，这种形势的发展，一点也没有什么奇怪。
