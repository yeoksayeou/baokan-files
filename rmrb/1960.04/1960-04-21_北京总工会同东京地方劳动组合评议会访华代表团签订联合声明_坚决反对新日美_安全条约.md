Xinhua News Agency, 20th April: The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the visiting delegation from the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan signed a joint statement in Beijing today.

In the joint statement, the visiting delegation from the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions stated: The Japanese working class and the broad masses of the Japanese people clearly see that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government is a military alliance aimed at opposing China and the Soviet Union. U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government are attempting to use this military alliance as a foundation to realize Japan's nuclear armament and the dispatch of troops overseas to once again invade Asia. The Japanese monopoly capital and its agent, the Nobusuke Kishi government, signed this military alliance treaty, which marks the resurgence of Japanese militarism and attempts to make Japan a militaristic and imperialist country once again. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions believes that the signing of a new military alliance treaty by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries has not only aroused great indignation among the people of China and Japan but has also been strongly opposed by all countries around the world, especially the people of Southeast Asia. The people of China and Japan, the people of Southeast Asian countries, and peace-loving people of all countries in the world will certainly be able to completely smash the heinous schemes of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism.

Both sides unanimously believe that U.S. imperialism and the re-emerging Japanese militarism are the common enemies of the workers and people of China and Japan, and that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" they have signed is resolutely opposed by the workers and people of both countries. Both sides also believe that exposing the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism and defending peace in Asia are the most urgent common tasks of the workers of China and Japan at present. The joint statement points out: Both sides will, while maintaining close contact in the future, work together with all the workers of the two countries to further expand united actions to defend peace.

Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and Okamoto Ushitato, Chairman of the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions and Head of the visiting delegation from the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan, signed the joint statement.

Attending today's signing ceremony on the Chinese side were Wang Yingpu, Xu Ping, Song Zhongyuan, Zhang Chenggang, Wang Ji, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and Shi Huang, Minister of the International Liaison Department. On the Japanese side were Iizaki Seiji, Deputy Head of the visiting delegation from the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Sugimoto Yasutsugu, Secretary-General, and members Mita Asamaru, Ito Kiyoshi, Hosoe Sadatsuke, and Takeuchi Motohiro.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Chen Yu, Minister of the International Liaison Department, also attended the signing ceremony. Before the signing ceremony, Zhu Xuefan and Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, met with all members of the visiting delegation from the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

    北京总工会同东京地方劳动组合评议会访华代表团签订联合声明
    坚决反对新日美“安全条约”
    新华社20日讯　北京市总工会同日本东京地方劳动组合评议会访华代表团今天在北京签订了联合声明。
    在这个联合声明中，东京地方劳动组合评议会访华代表团表示：日本工人阶级及日本广大人民很清楚地看到美帝国主义和岸信介政府签订的新日美“安全条约”是以中、苏为敌的军事同盟，美帝国主义和岸信介政府企图以这个军事同盟为基础来实现日本的核武装和向海外派兵，再次地侵略亚洲；日本垄断资本及其代理人岸信介政府签订这个军事同盟条约，标志着日本军国主义的重新复活，企图使日本再次成为军国主义的帝国主义国家。北京市总工会认为，美日反动派签订新的军事同盟条约，不仅激起了中日两国人民的极大愤慨，而且遭到全世界各国特别是东南亚各国人民的强烈反对。中日两国人民和东南亚各国人民以及全世界爱好和平的各国人民，一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义和日本军国主义的罪恶阴谋。
    双方一致认为，美帝国主义和重新复活的日本军国主义是中日两国工人及人民的共同敌人，他们所签订的新日美“安全条约”是中日两国工人和人民所一致坚决反对的。双方还认为，揭露美帝国主义势力的侵略野心及保卫亚洲和平的斗争是中日两国工人目前最迫切的共同任务。联合声明指出：双方今后要在紧密取得联系的同时，同两国的全体工人一起，共同为进一步扩大保卫和平的团结行动而努力。
    北京市总工会主席王炯和日本东京地方评议会议长、日本东京地方劳动组合评议会访华代表团团长冈本丑太郎在联合声明上签字。
    参加今天签字仪式的，中国方面有北京市总工会副秘书长王瑛璞、许平、常委宋仲元、张成刚、王骥和国际联络部部长石煌。日本方面有日本东京地方劳动组合评议会访华代表团副团长饭崎清治，事务局长杉本安次和团员三田朝丸、伊东洁、细江贞助、竹内基浩。
