Studying Chairman Mao's Works and Scientific Research in a "Three-Way Combination"
Representative Feng Yuanjun Discusses the Experience of Shandong University's Chinese Department Teachers and Students in Compiling "A History of Chinese Literature"

Fellow Representatives:
    I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I am determined to do my utmost to convey the spirit of the reports and, together with the masses, implement them with practical actions.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report stated: "While supporting the high-speed development of production and construction, we must actively support the high-speed development of cultural, educational, health, and scientific undertakings." As a university teacher, I would like to say a few words about scientific research in universities. My speech mainly explains some new paths taken in scientific research work over the past year under the leadership of the Party. Due to my limited experience, what I am talking about is only my personal experience and understanding; the focus is on the "three-way combination" and studying Chairman Mao's works.

The "Three-Way Combination" of Party Committee, Teachers, and Students is an Extremely Superior Collective Research Method

    Let's start with the "three-way combination."

    In March of last year, a group of teachers and students from the Chinese Department of Shandong University began a large-scale scientific research project. This project used the "three-way combination" method to collectively compile a three-million-word History of Chinese Literature, with the goal of presenting the initial draft of the book as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day. All participants were very excited at the time because this was a major and glorious task. At the same time, everyone felt the task was arduous because: the scale was unprecedentedly large, it had to be of high quality and quantity, and the compilation work could only be carried out in the spare time of half a year. However, contrary to the expectations of some conservative thinkers, this glorious and arduous task was actually completed. The initial draft of the History of Literature appeared as scheduled at the Shandong University's 10th Anniversary of National Day Exhibition. This is indeed a new thing in my experience with scientific research.

    The emergence of this new thing is of course related to the active labor of the compilers, but more importantly, the decisive factor is the extremely superior collective research method of the "three-way combination." The "three-way combination" is superior because it is a combination of the Party committee, teachers, and students, which includes Party leadership, the mass line, and conforms to the spirit of "walking on two legs." The Party pointed out the correct direction to teachers and students, carried out ideological mobilization, encouraged active work, criticized backward work, and urged everyone to maximize their potential and overcome difficulties. The power of the masses with politics in command is immeasurable. Dozens of students who participated in the compilation were full of enthusiasm, attacking the scientific fortress of the History of Literature with vigor and determination. Their work enthusiasm created a lively atmosphere that powerfully stimulated the enthusiasm of the teachers, and the enthusiasm of the teachers in turn encouraged the students. Such mutual influence and promotion enabled some people who felt overwhelmed at the beginning of the compilation to become more and more capable and energetic. In addition, teachers and students each have their own characteristics. Generally speaking, teachers have more information, while students are more receptive to new methods and new viewpoints. Now that both sides are learning from each other's strengths and making up for their weaknesses, the work is progressing much more smoothly. The initial draft of the three-million-word History of Literature was completed in the "three-way combination" mode, overcoming difficulties, advancing rapidly, and finally realizing the plan.

    On the surface, compiling the History of Literature seems to be an isolated work in the professional field. In fact, if viewed in connection with other aspects, it can be recognized that the effects of the "three-way combination" scientific research method go far beyond the scope of professional work. Its political significance is very profound and significant. The main points are as follows:

    First of all, the "three-way combination" made this compilation of the History of Literature fast, good, and economical. This fact can shatter the right-leaning ideas of some people who believe that cultural, educational, and scientific work cannot be fast, good, and economical, and improve their understanding of the general line, encouraging them to join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward.

    Secondly, the contradiction between individualism and collectivism is originally a reflection of the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in ideology. Therefore, breaking individualism and establishing collectivism is an important content of current ideological transformation. For cultural and educational workers, collective scientific research is a practice of promoting collectivism and destroying individualism. Facts have also provided proof. During the compilation of the History of Literature, those with serious individualism were not active in their work, and therefore were criticized by the masses, and they themselves had to admit their mistakes. Acknowledging mistakes is also, to some extent, an improvement in thinking.

    Thirdly, using the "three-way combination" method to engage in scientific research is one of the ways to establish new teacher-student relationships and eliminate old teacher-student relationships. When teachers and students march towards science together, a comrade-like relationship is gradually formed. Since the foundation of respecting teachers and loving students is based on the common development of the people's scientific cause, it has political significance and is therefore healthy.

    Finally, the "three-way combination" method teaches us how to follow the mass line. Students are the masses of teachers, and they are the ones that teachers should often contact and contact well. However, most old teachers have the old habit and bad habit of closing their doors and doing their own thing. This leads to their serious detachment from the masses in research work and teaching work. The "three-way combination" method drags these old teachers out of their cold and quiet studies and pushes them towards the lively student groups. As a result, they go from being unaccustomed to being accustomed, and finally reach the point where they feel that work is not easy to do without contacting the masses, and they take the initiative and naturally mingle with the students. The establishment of the mass viewpoint also marks the improvement of the political level.

    In summary, in a nutshell, the reason why the new "three-way combination" method has so many advantages is because it takes Party leadership as its core.

Using Chairman Mao's Theories to Solve Encountered Problems

    After the initial draft of the History of Literature was presented as a gift for last year's National Day, the compilation work turned to the revision stage. The characteristic of this stage is that scientific research is closely combined with political study, and it is more evident in the study of Chairman Mao's works.

    Last autumn, all regions and units across the country, under the leadership of the Party, were enthusiastically studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and Shandong University was no exception. The revision of the History of Literature began at this time. Opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale were important contents of studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Through this stage of political study, the fire in the middle reaches was ignited. This fire made the revision of the History of Literature leap again and again; the work originally scheduled to be completed by this year's National Day or the end of this year was all moved up to before May 1st. Specifically, the pre-Qin part of the History of Literature was decided to be published before May 1st, and the other parts were also finalized at the same time, and presented as a gift for May 1st.

    When the middle-reach thoughts were burned away and the general branch of the department grasped the revision of the History of Literature, political study was turning to the stage of studying Chairman Mao's works. Teachers and students of the Chinese Department voluntarily gave up their winter vacation rest, and under the leadership of the Party, enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's literary and artistic theories, while continuously using Chairman Mao's theories to solve some problems encountered in revising the History of Literature.

    On this basis, in mid-February, the Shandong University Party Committee put forward instructions on the new direction of compiling and writing the History of Literature. The basic spirit of the instructions is: This History of Literature should be written under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and should serve socialist construction and proletarian politics. The main points of the instructions are:

    (1) The History of Literature must adhere to the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Its target audience is workers, peasants, and soldiers cadres with a cultural level of secondary school or above, teachers and students of various schools, literature lovers and researchers, and the broad masses who have improved their cultural level through various methods. Its task is the unity of improvement and popularization.

    (2) The History of Literature must reflect the spiritual outlook of the Chinese nation—the noble qualities of diligence, bravery, and love of freedom, patriotism, and the revolutionary tradition of anti-feudal oppression; use this to enhance the self-confidence of the people and enrich their spiritual lives, so that they can promote history forward with more vigor.

    (3) The History of Literature's evaluation of ancient writers and works must adhere to the principle of putting politics first; it must also correctly apply historical materialism, and must not only look at the role these writers and works played at the time, but more importantly, look at the role they (or it) play today.

    (4) In order to achieve the above three requirements, the compilers must cut off the tails of bourgeois ideology, transform their class stand, and transform their world outlook.

    The instructions of the Party Committee shook the hearts of all the History of Literature compilers. Everyone realized that the new direction pointed out by the Party Committee conformed to the requirements of this great era. Everyone also realized that: compiling the History of Literature, although it is scientific research, has profound political significance; writing the History of Literature in this way can not only solve the problem of how to make the past serve the present, but also is a practice of changing the old world outlook and establishing a new world outlook, but if we do not study Chairman Mao's works in depth, everything will be like climbing a tree to catch fish. After the understanding has improved a step further, the teachers and students, with an unusually excited mood, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant works, transformed their thinking, and on this basis, everyone studied and discussed day and night how to implement the instructions of the Party Committee. From viewpoints, materials, chapter arrangements, to writing style, everything was carefully checked using Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts as the standard; if anything was found to be unqualified, it would be completely overturned and rewritten from scratch. Doing both theoretical and practical work, of course the revision work increased much more than originally planned, but everyone's confidence in completing it as scheduled did not waver.

    Obviously, with the political and professional level of the teachers and students of the Chinese Department of Shandong University, it is difficult to carry out this large-scale revolutionary History of Literature, but we believe in the leadership of the Party, believe in the power of the collective, and are determined to complete this glorious task. Of course, the final draft that will be taken out, and the book that will be printed, will inevitably have many errors. We will sincerely await the criticism of the vast number of readers, and on the basis of further studying Chairman Mao's works, humbly correct them. We earnestly hope that a revolution will occur in the scientific field of the History of Literature, pushing this science to a new stage, so that it can better serve socialist construction and proletarian politics.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun called on everyone to strive to achieve the twelve-year science plan in a relatively short period of time, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that 1960 will usher in a higher upsurge in cultural construction. I hope that the History of Literature compiled by the teachers and students of the Chinese Department of Shandong University is not far from the current requirements. If this hope can be realized, it is due to the care and education of the Party, and the glory should belong to the Party.

    The above is extremely superficial, and if there are any errors, I hope the representatives will criticize and correct them.

    学习毛主席著作和科学研究的“三结合”
    冯沅君代表谈山东大学中文系师生编写“中国文学史”的经验各位代表：
    我完全同意、拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和全国人民代表大会常委会的报告。我决心尽全力把报告的精神传达下去，并和群众一起，用实际行动来贯彻执行。
    李先念副总理的报告曾说：“在支持高速度发展生产建设的同时，积极支持文教卫生和科学事业的高速度发展。”我是个高等学校的教师，现在就高等学校的科学研究说几句话。我这个发言主要说明：一年来，在党的领导下，科学研究工作所走的某些新道路。由于我的见闻不广，因而所谈的只是我个人的经历和体会；其中的重点则是“三结合”与学习毛主席的著作。党委、教师和同学的“三结合”是极其优越的集体研究方式
    从“三结合”说起。
    去年3月，山东大学中文系的一部分教师与一部分同学，开始了规模较大的科学研究工作。这个工作是用“三结合”的方式，集体编写一部三百万字的中国文学史，并决定以书的初稿向国庆十周年献礼。参加编写的人当时都很兴奋，因为这是一项重大的任务，是光荣的任务。同时，大家也感到任务的艰巨，因为：规模是空前的大，既须保质保量，而编写工作却只能在半年内的课余时间进行。可是，出乎某些思想保守的人的意外，这个光荣而艰巨的任务居然完成了。文学史的初稿如期地出现在山东大学的国庆十周年献礼展览会上。这在我所经过的科学研究工作中确是个新
    这个新事的出现，当然与编写者的积极劳动有关，但更重要的，起决定作用的则是“三结合”这个极其优越的集体研究方式。“三结合”之所以优越，因为它是党委、教师、同学三者的结合，这里有党领导，有群众路线，而且符合“两条腿走路”的精神。党给教师和同学指出正确的方向，作思想动员，鼓励工作积极的，批评工作落后的，督促大家尽量发挥潜力，突破难关。政治挂了帅的群众的力量是难以估计的巨大。参加编写的几十位同学，人人干劲十足，冲着文学史这个科学堡垒，猛攻猛打。他们的工作热情造成个轰轰烈烈的气氛，这气氛有力地激发了教师的积极性，而教师的积极性又回转过来鼓励了同学。这样的交互影响、推动，使一些在开始编写时感到心中无数的人，到后来，则越干越有办法，越带劲。此外，教师和同学各有其特点。一般的说，教师掌握资料较多，同学易于接受新方法、新观点。现在双方截长补短，互相补充，工作进行便顺利得多。三百万字的文学史初稿就是这样在“三结合”的方式中，克服困难，迅速前进，而终于实现了计划。
    从表面上看，孤立地看，编写文学史是属于业务方面的工作，实际上，如果联系着其他方面来看，便会认识到“三结合”这个科学研究方式所收的效果，大大超出业务的范围。它的政治意义非常深刻显著。择其要者而言，有以下四点：
    首先，“三结合”使这次文学史的编写工作多快好省。这样的事实就可以粉碎某些人以为文教科学工作不能多快好省的右倾思想，而提高他们对总路线的认识，策励他们投入跃进的行列。
  其次，个人主义与集体主义的矛盾原是资产阶级与无产阶级的斗争在思想意识上的反映。因此，破个人主义，立集体主义也就是当前思想改造的一个重要内容。对于文教工作者，集体搞科学研究实是发扬集体主义，摧毁个人主义的一种实践。事实也提供了证明。在编写文学史的过程中，个人主义严重的人工作便不积极，因而受到群众的批评，他自己也不得不承认错误。承认错误，在一定程度上也是思想提高。
    再次，用“三结合”的方式搞科学研究是树立新的师生关系，消除旧的师生关系的途径之一。当师生一同向科学进军时，同志式的关系便逐步形成了。尊师爱生的基础既建立在共同发展人民的科学事业上，它就具有政治意义，因而是健康的。
    最后，“三结合”的方式教导我们如何走群众路线。同学本是教师的群众，他们是教师应该常常联系、好好联系的。可是，多数老教师都有关起门来，自搞一套的老习惯、坏习惯。这就导致他们在研究工作上，在教学工作上，严重地脱离群众。“三结合”的方式则将这些老教师们从冷冷清清的书房里拖出来，推动他们走向热热闹闹的学生群。于是，他们由不习惯到习惯，最后达到，不联系群众就觉得工作不好做，而主动地、自然地与学生打成一片。群众观点的树立也就标志着政治水平的提高。
    总起来说，一语道破，“三结合”这个新方式之所以具有这样多的优点，是因为它以党领导为核心。
    以毛主席的理论来解决遇到的问题
    文学史初稿在去年国庆献礼后，编写工作就转入修改阶段。这阶段的特点是科学研究与政治学习结合得很紧密，而在学习毛主席的著作中表现得更明显。
    去年秋天，全国各地区、各单位都在党的领导下，热火朝天地学习八届八中全会的文件，山东大学也如此。文学史的修改工作也就是这个时候开始的。反右倾，鼓干劲本是学习八届八中全会文件的重要内容，通过这阶段的政治学习，烧中游的火便点起来了。这把火把文学史的修改工作烧得一跃再跃；原来定在今年国庆或今年年底完成的工作，一律提到五一以前完成。具体的说，就是文学史的先秦部分决定在五一以前出版，其他部分也同时拿出定稿，并以此向五一献礼。
    当中游思想被烧掉，系总支抓紧文学史修改工作的时候，政治学习正转入学习毛主席著作的阶段。中文系师生自动放弃寒假休息，在党的领导下，热烈的学习毛主席文艺理论，同时不断以毛主席的理论来解决修改文学史时遇到的一些问题。
    在这样的基础上，2月中旬，山东大学党委提出关于编著文学史的新方向的指示。指示的基本精神是：这部文学史应是在毛泽东的思想的指导下写成的，应是为社会主义建设，为无产阶级政治服务的。指示的要点是：
      （一）文学史必须坚持工农兵方向。它的对象是具有中等以上文化水平的工农兵干部，各类学校的师生、文学爱好者和研究者、以及通过各种方法提高了文化水平的广大群众。它的任务是提高与普及的统一。
      （二）文学史必须反映中华民族的精神面貌——勤劳勇敢、酷爱自由的高贵品质，爱国主义和反封建压迫的革命传统；用此提高人民群众的自信心，并丰富他们的精神生活，使他们更意气风发地推动历史前进。
      （三）文学史对古代作家、作品的评价，必须坚持政治标准第一；又必须正确运用历史唯物主义，不但要看这些作家、作品在当时起的作用如何，更重要的是看他们（或它们）在今天起的作用如何。
      （四）为实现以上三种要求，编写者必须割掉资产阶级思想的尾巴，转变阶级立场，改造世界观。
    党委的指示震奋了全体文学史编写者的心。大家体会到党委所指出的新方向是符合当前这个伟大的时代的要求的。大家又认识到：编写文学史虽是科学研究，但有深刻的政治意义；这样来写文学史，不仅可以解决如何才是古为今用的问题，而且是改变旧世界观、树立新世界观的一种实践，但是，如果不深入地学习毛主席的著作，一切都是缘木求鱼。在认识提高了一步之后，师生们都怀着异常兴奋的心情，反复钻研毛主席的有关著作，改造自己的思想，并在这样的基础上，大家日日夜夜地研究、讨论如何实现党委的指示。从观点、资料、章节安排，以至文风，处处用毛主席的文艺思想为标准仔细检查；如果发现不合格的，即完全推翻，从新另写。既务虚，又务实，当然修改工作较原定的增加了许多，可是，大家如期完成的信心毫不动摇。
    很明显，以山东大学中文系师生的政治水平、业务水平，来搞这部具有革命性的大型文学史是有困难的，但是我们相信党的领导，相信集体力量，有决心来完成这个光荣任务。当然，将来拿出来的定稿，印出来的书难免有许多错误，我们将诚恳地等待广大读者的批评，在进一步学习毛主席的著作的基础上，虚心地予以纠正。我们切盼在文学史科学领域内能出现一次革命，将这门科学推向新阶段，使它能更好地为社会主义建设、无产阶级政治服务。
    李富春副总理号召大家争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学规划，李先念副总理指出1960年将掀起更高的文化建设高潮，我希望山东大学中文系师生这次编的文学史和当前的要求距离不远。如果这个希望可以实现，那是由于党的关怀、教育，光荣应该归于党。
    以上所谈极为肤浅，如有错误，望代表们批评指正。
