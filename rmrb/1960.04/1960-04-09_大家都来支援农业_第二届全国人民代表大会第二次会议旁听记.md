Everyone Supports Agriculture
—Notes from Observing the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress
This Newspaper Reporter
	In the rural areas of Changzhi County, Jin Southeast, every Sunday, people often see fifteen old workers, carrying tools, machine parts, technical materials, propaganda materials, and dry rations, helping farmers repair machines. They work diligently for the commune from morning to night, never eating the commune members' food, never accepting gifts, never making conditions, and never caring about compensation.

	They are master craftsmen from the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant, who automatically organized the "Mobile Repair Shock Group" to enthusiastically support their farmer brothers, doing "whenever called, always arriving; if not called on Sunday, finding work themselves." From the beginning of last year to March of this year, the master craftsmen have repaired and installed 163 sets (times) of various machines for the nearby three communes, produced more than 2,500 various parts, and trained 30 technical workers for the countryside. Recently, they also proposed a competition initiative of "Everyone doing a few good deeds to support agriculture," which has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of workers in Shanxi Province. Every Sunday, workers from all over the province go to communes to impart technology, repair machines at irrigation and drainage stations, and use waste materials and scraps to manufacture small farm tools for commune members... The mass movement to support agriculture has been fully launched on the industrial front in Shanxi Province.

	Jiao Guonai, a representative from Shanxi Province, praised the excellent qualities of these fifteen old workers from the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant when introducing the mass movement of technical transformation to support agriculture in Shanxi Province.

	The large-scale support for agricultural technical transformation by the industrial departments of Shanxi Province is carried out in a planned and organized manner under the overall planning and strengthened leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The method adopted is overall arrangement, with factories and counties linked, and factories and communes linked. More than 1,700 factories and mines above the county level in the province are linked with more than 900 people's communes in 66 counties. This spring, the climate in Shanxi is dry. Many factories throughout the province have joined the battle against drought. More than 30 factories and 18 communes in Jiexiu County coordinated their actions, transferring more than 300 machines and building 21 high-lift irrigation stations in 17 days, turning 110,000 mu of dry land on high ground into irrigated land. When local commune members saw river water flowing into the fields, they were moved to tears and sang in praise:
  "In the past, it was difficult to get water on the high ground, but now we lead water to irrigate the fields; because we have the leadership of the Party, and the support of the workers."

	The great leap forward in agricultural production has put forward many new demands on industrial departments. Li Kezuo and Huang Runping, representatives from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, talked about a thought-provoking issue in their speeches.

	This factory has grown along with the socialist transformation of agriculture and the great development of agricultural production. During the period of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, it provided the countryside with various walking plows, weeding hoes, chaff cutters, and rice threshers; after the widespread establishment of primary agricultural cooperatives, it supplied the countryside with double-wheeled double-shared plows, rocker arm harvesters, etc.; since the realization of agricultural collectivization and the people's communes, it has produced self-propelled grain combine harvesters, swathers, artificial rain machines, and universal chassis tractors, etc. for the countryside. However, since the Great Leap Forward, a new problem has emerged: the combine harvesters produced by this factory in the past were all designed according to a yield of 400 to 500 jin per mu, and the high-yield fields and bumper crop areas of wheat in many areas cannot be harvested with this kind of machinery; moreover, this kind of harvester can only harvest wheat and soybeans, and cannot be comprehensively utilized for other farm work.

	What to do? In order to better equip agriculture, new research work began. With the help of Soviet experts, the factory and Tsinghua University and other units have worked together for a year and finally successfully trial-produced a new type of combine harvester. This combine harvester can harvest high-yield wheat with a yield of about 1,100 jin per mu. It does not need a tractor and can be operated by one person, and can harvest 170,000 jin of wheat per day. After the harvest season, it can also be converted into a farm truck for transportation or for fixed operations such as irrigation and threshing. The employees of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory cherish and commemorate this new combine harvester and gave it a name, called "Friendship Brand Automatic Combine Harvester."

	In today's countryside where the people's communes have been realized, the worker-peasant alliance in our country has entered a new stage. In order to gradually realize the technical transformation of agriculture and gradually realize the modernization of agriculture, not only in the industrial departments, but also in transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, health and other departments, supporting agriculture is regarded as their important task. From the speeches of many representatives from all walks of life, we have seen the great strength of the people of the whole country, united as one, supporting agriculture.

	Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Railways, depicted a beautiful prospect for the construction of local small indigenous and modern railways. He said that the people's communes urgently need railways along with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, and they are also able to build railways. Now the enthusiasm for building railways in various places is getting higher and higher. According to preliminary statistics, tens of thousands of kilometers of local railways will be built this year. Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan Province has put forward an ambitious plan: they will build railways and manufacture rolling stock and locomotives on a large scale this year. The first step is to achieve three connections - mines connect to factories, coal mines connect to stations, and stations connect to wharves; and on this basis, further connect counties and key communes with railways, and gradually form a railway network throughout the region.

	After the rural communization, it is urgently necessary to use postal and telecommunications as a powerful weapon for the Great Leap Forward to seize every minute and second. The national postal and telecommunications workers regard it as their glorious responsibility to be good communication soldiers for steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

	Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, said that in the past two years, rural telephone lines have been extended to 1.6 million pole-kilometer, and 820,000 telephone sets have been installed. Almost all rural people's communes, most production brigades, and some production teams throughout the country have telephone access, or can hold meetings on the phone; the broad masses of farmers can send letters and subscribe to newspapers without leaving their teams or villages. Tens of thousands of rural postal workers across the country deliver letters and newspapers to the broad masses of farmers every day on millions of kilometers of postal routes, delivering parcels and remittances to their doorsteps, like a mobile post office. In the most tense days and nights of flood prevention and drought resistance in 1959, postal and telecommunications workers overcame various dangers and difficulties, and achieved "where the water conservancy headquarters is, the telephone will be set up there," ensuring smooth telecommunications and timely delivery of letters and newspapers.

	The commercial sector is the logistics department of agricultural production, and is praised as: a bridge between industry and agriculture, and a link between urban and rural areas. It plays an extremely important role in supporting agricultural production. From the beginning of this year to mid-March, the commercial sector has supplied the rural people's communes with 2.22 billion yuan of means of production. Among them are a large number of power irrigation and drainage machinery, double-wheeled double-shared plows, chemical fertilizers, etc. Commercial workers in various places also actively help the rural people's communes to run industries on a large scale, taking materials locally, manufacturing and supplying them locally.

	Zeng Chuanliu, Vice Minister of Commerce, expressed his views on the issue of the commercial sector supporting agricultural production at the meeting. He said that at present, a mass movement centered on supporting the "three transformations" of agriculture has been vigorously launched in the commercial departments across the country. In addition to actively supplying agricultural means of production and actively helping the rural people's communes develop the means of production industry, the commercial sector must also firmly grasp the procurement of agricultural products throughout the year, find sales channels for agricultural products, provide raw materials for industry, promote the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the supply of market materials and export needs.

	On the cultural, educational, and health fronts, a movement to support agriculture has also been vigorously launched. The broad masses of cultural, educational, and health workers are doing everything possible to serve the farmers and support the all-round leap forward in agricultural production. In the past two years, professional cultural and artistic workers have gone to the countryside and mountains in batches to work and live with the farmers and carry out the work of popularizing culture. They have written many works, painted many paintings, composed many songs, and performed many dramas for the farmers, reflecting new people and new things from all aspects, and have been warmly welcomed by the farmers. This team, which was sent by the working class to the countryside to support agriculture, is using various cultural and artistic tools to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, improve the communist consciousness of the farmers, and promote the leap forward in agricultural production; at the same time, they have transformed and improved themselves through labor and integration with the farmers.

	The cultural activities and artistic creations of the peasant masses have also shown an unprecedentedly active and prosperous situation. This vigorous rural cultural activity across the country is very beneficial to consolidating the people's communes and developing production.

	Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, said in his speech "Mobilizing All Cultural Forces to Support Agriculture" that continuing to vigorously develop mass cultural activities, especially rural cultural activities, is an extremely glorious task that every literary and art worker must undertake. We must hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, mobilize all cultural and artistic forces to support agriculture, and bravely advance towards the further popularization and continuous improvement of rural cultural and artistic work.

	The white-clad warriors are particularly active in the vast rural areas. In many places, it has already begun to be achieved: wherever there is a labor army, there are white-clad warriors; wherever there are illnesses and injuries, there are medicines and doctors. Many medical personnel who have been working in cities for a long time have also changed the old ideological style of "doctors not knocking on doors" and "practicing medicine in hospitals" that are divorced from production and the masses, and have gone deep into the masses to practice medicine and carry out disease prevention and control work on the spot. Representative Tang Wuyuan said that when the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to all citizens to support the countryside with cities and support agriculture with industry, all medical staff were excited and competed to support the countryside as an honor. All general hospitals in the city have further technically linked up with county hospitals, adopting methods such as receiving patients, sending personnel down, surgical demonstrations, mobile treatment, holding correspondence courses, and organizing lectures to train the technical force of each county, and also using methods such as purchasing, selling, and allocating on behalf of others to enrich the medical equipment of each county.

    大家都来支援农业
    ——第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议旁听记
    本报记者
    在晋东南长治县农村，一到星期天，人们经常看到十五个老工人，背着工具、机器配件、技术资料、宣传材料和干粮，在帮助农民修理机器。他们从早到晚辛勤地为公社劳动，从来不吃社员的饭，不收礼，不讲条件，不计报酬。
    他们是长治钢铁厂的老师傅，自动组织了“巡回检修突击组”，热情地去支援农民兄弟，做到了“啥时叫，啥时到，星期日不叫自己找”。从去年年初到今年3月，老师傅们已经为附近的三个公社修配和安装了一百六十三台（次）各种机器，配制了两千五百多件各种零件，还为农村培养了三十名技术工人。最近，他们又提出“人人为支援农业办几件好事”的竞赛倡议，得到了山西省广大工人的热烈响应。每逢星期天，全省各地的工人，有的到公社传授技术，有的到排灌站检修机器，有的利用废料、边料为社员制造小农具……，支援农业的群众运动，已经在山西省的工业战线全面展开。
    山西省代表焦国鼐，在介绍山西省支援农业技术改造的群众运动时，赞扬了长治钢铁厂这十五名老工人的优良品质。
    山西省工业部门大规模地支援农业技术改造，是在中共山西省委全面规划和加强领导之下，有计划、有组织地进行的。采取的方法是全面安排，厂县挂钩、厂社挂钩。全省一千七百多个县营以上的厂矿，和六十六个县的九百多个人民公社挂了钩。今春山西气候干旱。全省许多工厂投入了抗旱的战斗。介休县的三十多个工厂和十八个公社协同动作，抽调了三百多台机器，在十七天内建成了二十一座高灌站，把十一万亩高垣旱地变成了水浇地。当地社员们看到河水流入田间，热泪盈眶，作歌赞道：
  “过去高垣吃水难，如今引水来灌田；因为有了党领导，有了工人来支援。”
    农业生产大跃进，给工业部门提出了许多新的要求。北京农业机械厂的人民代表李克佐、黄润萍，在发言中谈到了一个值得人们深思的问题。
    这个工厂是随着农业社会主义改造和农业生产的大发展成长起来的。在互助组和个体农户时期，它为农村提供了各种步犁、耘锄、铡草机、打稻机等；初级农业合作社普遍成立后，它以双轮双铧犁、摇臂收割机等供应农村；自从农业实现了合作化、人民公社化到现在，它给农村生产了机引谷物联合收割机、割晒机、人工降雨机、万能底盘拖拉机等。但是，大跃进以来，一个新的问题出现了：这个工厂过去生产的联合收割机，都是按照每亩四、五百斤的产量设计的，许多地区的小麦高产田、丰产方，都无法用这种机械收割；而且这种收割机只能收获麦子、大豆，不能综合利用，干别的农活。
    怎么办呢？为了更好地装备农业，新的研究工作开始了。在苏联专家的帮助下，一年来这个工厂和清华大学等单位共同努力，终于试制成功了一种新的联合收割机。这种联合收割机能收获亩产一千一百斤左右的丰产小麦，它不需要拖拉机，由一个人操作，每天能收获小麦十七万斤。当收获季节过后，它还可以改装成农用卡车，用来运输或从事排灌、脱谷等固定作业。北京农业机械厂的职工珍视和纪念这种新的联合收割机，给它取了个名字，叫“友谊牌自动联合收割机”。
    在农村已经实现了人民公社化的今天，我国的工农联盟开始进入了一个新的阶段。为了逐步实现农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业的现代化，不仅在工业部门，而且在交通运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门，都把支援农业当作自己的重要任务。我们从各行各业的许多代表发言中，看到了全国人民万众一心，支援农业的伟大力量。
    铁道部副部长吕正操描绘了一幅地方小土、小洋铁路建设的美好前景。他说，人民公社在工农业生产迅速发展的同时，迫切需要铁路，也能够办铁路。现在各地办铁路的劲头越来越大，据初步统计，今年将修建上万公里地方铁路。河南省新乡专区提出了一个宏伟的计划：他们今年要大修铁路，大造车皮和火车头，第一步做到三通——矿山通工厂、煤矿通车站、车站通码头；并在这个基础上，进一步把县与县、县与重点公社用铁路联系起来，逐渐形成全区的铁路网。
    农村公社化以后，迫切需要把邮电通信作为大跃进分秒必争的有力武器。全国邮电职工以当好钢、煤、粮、棉的通信兵，作为自己的光荣职责。
    邮电部部长朱学范说，两年来农村电话线路已延长到一百六十万杆程公里，安装了八十二万部电话机。全国几乎所有的农村人民公社、大部分生产大队和部分生产队都通了电话，或者可以在电话上开会；广大农民寄信订报，可以不出队、不出村了。全国好几万农村邮递人员，每天在几百万公里的邮路上，为广大农民送信送报，把包裹、汇款送上门，好像一个流动的邮局一样。在1959年防汛、抗旱最紧张的日日夜夜里，邮电职工克服了各种艰险困苦，做到“水利指挥部在哪里，电话就架到哪里”，保证了电信联络畅通，信报及时投递。
    商业部门是农业生产的后勤部，被人们誉为：工业和农业之间的桥梁，联结城市和农村的纽带。它在支援农业生产中，发挥着极其重要的作用。从今年初到3月中旬，商业部门已供应农村人民公社二十二亿二千万元的生产资料。其中有大量的动力排灌机械、双轮双铧犁、化学肥料等等。各地的商业工作者，还积极帮助农村人民公社大办工业，就地取材，就地制造和供应。
    商业部副部长曾传六在会上，就商业部门支援农业生产的问题发表了意见。他说，目前，一个以支援农业“三化”为中心的群众运动，已经在各地商业部门中轰轰烈烈地开展起来。商业部门支援农业，除了积极供应农业生产资料，积极帮助农村人民公社发展生产资料工业，必须一年四季都抓紧农产品收购工作，为农产品找到销路，为工业提供原料，促进工农业生产的迅速发展，并保证市场物资的供应和出口需要。
    在文化、教育、卫生战线上，一个支援农业的运动也已经如火如荼地展开了。广大的文教卫生工作者，正在千方百计地为农民服务，支援农业生产的全面跃进。两年来，专业文化艺术工作者成批地下乡上山，和农民同劳动、同生活，进行普及文化的工作。他们为农民写了许多作品，画了许多画，作了许多歌曲，演了许多戏，从各方面反映新人新事，受到农民的热烈欢迎。这支被工人阶级派到农村去支援农业的队伍，就这样用各种文化艺术工具，来进一步巩固工农联盟，提高农民的共产主义觉悟，促进了农业生产的跃进；同时，他们又通过劳动，和农民结合，改造和提高了自己。
    农民群众的文化活动和文艺创作，也出现了空前活跃和繁荣的局面。这种遍及全国的蓬勃的农村文化活动，对于巩固人民公社、发展生产十分有利。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在他的“动员一切文化力量支援农业”的发言中说，继续努力发展群众文化活动，特别是农村文化活动，是每个文艺工作者必须担当的一项极其光荣的任务。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，动员一切文化艺术力量支援农业，为实现农村文化艺术工作的更加普及和不断提高而奋勇前进。
    白衣战士们在广大农村分外活跃。很多地方已开始做到了：哪里有劳动大军，哪里就有白衣战士；哪里有病有伤，哪里就有医有药。许多长期在城市中工作的医务人员，也改变了“医不叩门”、“坐院行医”的脱离生产脱离群众的旧思想作风，深入群众中就地行医和进行疾病防治工作。唐午园代表说，当中共武汉市委向全体市民提出城市支援农村、工业支援农业的号召后，全体医务工作人员人人振奋，个个争先，都以支援农村为光荣。全市各综合医院，都已分别和各县医院作了进一步的技术挂钩，采取接进来、派下去、手术示范、巡回治疗、举办函授、组织讲座等方式，培养各县技术力量，还采用代购、代销、调剂等办法，充实各县的医疗设备。
