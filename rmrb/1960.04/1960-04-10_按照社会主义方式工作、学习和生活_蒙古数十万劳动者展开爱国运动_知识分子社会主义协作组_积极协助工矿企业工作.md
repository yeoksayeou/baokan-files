Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 9th: According to a report from the Mongolian News Agency in Ulaanbaatar: The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published an editorial on the 6th, calling on the Mongolian working people to more broadly launch a patriotic movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

"Unen" wrote that the movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" has only been around for a little over a year in Mongolia, but this movement has already become a nationwide movement, with hundreds of thousands of workers participating in the ranks of this movement. For example, the socialist labor teams of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Line, Kharkhorin State Farm, Subain Oil Mine, and Choibalsan Industrial United Factory have set outstanding examples of "working, studying, and living in a socialist way."

The content of the movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" is: completing plans ahead of schedule, saving time, labor, and materials, constantly improving general knowledge and technical knowledge, demonstrating initiative and putting forward rationalization proposals everywhere, boldly breaking conventions and establishing new systems, and more widely instilling collectivist ideas among the working people.

The editorial mentioned that many advanced producers, including Lubsangdanzan, the leader of the socialist labor team of the Mongolian State Printing Factory, and Badarch, a fitter at the Ulaanbaatar Railway Locomotive Repair Factory, voluntarily gave up highly paid jobs and left their familiar collectives to transfer to backward units with lower wages. They are raising backward work sections to advanced levels by rationally arranging labor and tapping potential.

"Unen" finally called on everyone to fully value every progressive measure and every rationalization proposal of the socialist labor teams, and to carry out this movement more widely.

This newspaper also reports that more than 30 "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Groups" have been established in Mongolian cities and villages to assist industrial and mining enterprises. In addition, the socialist collaboration trend among intellectuals is also rising, and various collaboration organizations are constantly being established.

The first Mongolian "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Group," initiated by Darjaa, the president of the Mongolian "Labor News" and others, has established a collaborative relationship with the first Mongolian "Socialist Labor Team," helping the labor team improve the technical and cultural level of its members and helping the members arrange their lives. The collaboration group develops a work plan every three months and goes to work in the labor team during their spare time every week. Economic scholars, engineers, and literary workers in the collaboration group enthusiastically give political theory and technical theory lessons to the labor team members, and organize music concerts and other activities. The collaboration group also cooperates with the labor team to go to factories, enterprises, and schools to promote and introduce the labor team's experience in working, studying, and living in a socialist way.

The work carried out by the first "Intellectual Socialist Collaboration Group" has had a wide impact among Mongolian intellectuals. Many intellectuals have successively organized to go to factories and enterprises to assist in their work. Now the organizational forms of mutual collaboration among intellectuals have also developed. For example, the teacher collaboration group composed of teachers mainly focuses on mutual collaboration among teachers to improve their professional level and do a good job in teaching. The college student collaboration group composed of college students mainly carries out mutual assistance among students so that everyone can study well.

    按照社会主义方式工作、学习和生活
    蒙古数十万劳动者展开爱国运动
    “知识分子社会主义协作组”积极协助工矿企业工作
    新华社乌兰巴托9日电　据蒙古通讯社乌兰巴托讯：蒙古“真理报”6日发表社论，号召蒙古劳动人民更加广泛地开展争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的爱国主义运动。
    “真理报”写道，蒙古出现争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动到现在才一年多，但是，这个运动已经成为全民性的运动，数十万劳动者都投入了这个运动的行列。例如，乌兰巴托铁路线、哈尔霍林国营农牧场、苏巴因油矿和乔巴山工业联合工厂等单位的社会主义劳动队都树立了“按照社会主义方式工作、学习和生活”的出色榜样。
    争取“社会主义劳动队”称号运动的内容是：提前完成计划，节省时间、劳力和材料，经常提高普通知识和技术知识水平，处处表现首创精神和提出合理化建议，大胆打破常规和建立新的制度，更广泛地在劳动人民中间灌输集体主义思想等。
    社论谈到，许多先进生产者，其中包括蒙古国家印刷厂社会主义劳动队队长鲁布桑丹赞和乌兰巴托铁路机车修理厂的钳工巴达尔齐等人，都自愿放弃高报酬的工作，离开自己熟悉的集体，转到了工资较少的落后单位。他们正在通过合理安排劳动和发掘潜力使落后工段提高到先进水平。
    “真理报”最后号召，所有的人都应充分重视社会主义劳动队的每一项进步措施和每一条合理化建议，并且更加广泛地开展这一运动。
    本报讯　目前蒙古的城市和乡村已经建立了三十多个“知识分子社会主义协作组”，协助工矿企业部门工作。此外，知识分子之间的社会主义协作之风也正在兴起，各种协作组织不断成立。
    由蒙古“劳动报”社长达尔扎等人发起组织的蒙古第一个“知识分子社会主义协作组”，已经同蒙古第一个“社会主义劳动队”建立了协作关系，帮助劳动队提高队员的技术和文化水平，并且帮助队员们安排生活。协作组每三个月制订一次工作计划，每星期利用业余时间到劳动队工作。协作组里的经济学者、工程师和文艺工作者热情地向劳动队队员讲政治理论课和技术理论课，并且组织音乐演奏会等活动。协作组还同劳动队合作到工厂企业和学校去宣传，介绍劳动队按照社会主义方式进行工作、学习和生活的经验。
  第一个“知识分子社会主义协作组”开展的工作，在蒙古知识分子中间发生了广泛的影响。许多知识分子已经先后组织起来到工厂、企业去协助工作。现在知识分子间相互协作的组织形式又有发展。例如由教师们组成的教师协作组，主要是教师间相互协作，以提高业务水平和作好教学工作。大学生们组成的大学生协作组主要是展开同学间的相互帮助，使人人都学习好。
