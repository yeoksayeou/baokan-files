Chairman, fellow members:

I wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960," and fully agree with the report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the CPPCC Standing Committee.

Now I want to talk about the inspiration I gained from visiting industrial construction in Handan and Northeast China.

I am an agricultural worker, so in the past three years, my inspection targets have mainly been agricultural production, agricultural institutions, and farmers' lives, with less focus on industry. However, in the past six months, thanks to the organization of the National Committee of the CPPCC's visiting groups, I spent more than a month twice visiting industrial construction in Handan City, Hebei Province, and the three northeastern provinces. The impression I got was extremely profound. I feel that the achievements of China's industrial construction, like agriculture, are advancing by leaps and bounds, are remarkable, and are beyond the dreams of intellectuals in the old era. The reason for this great achievement in industrial construction, like agriculture, is entirely due to the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the wise and correct leadership of the Party. I gained a lot of inspiration during the visits in various places, and I would like to briefly put them forward for your correction.

I. China's industrial construction is developing most comprehensively and at the highest speed.

The brilliant achievements of industrial construction demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the wise and correct leadership of the Party. Many consumer cities in the old era are now lined with factories and have been transformed into industrial cities. For example, before liberation, Handan City, Hebei Province, had only two destroyed mines, the Cishan Iron Mine with an annual output of 30,000 tons of iron, and a few simple small factories. At present, it has many industrial enterprises, and the number of industrial employees has increased to 135,000. During the Japanese invasion and occupation, Fushun City had only 300,000 residents, of whom 100,000 were Japanese. Now, due to the development of industry, the city has 1.5 million residents, including 300,000 workers. All the Japanese have been sent back to their country.

Among the industries run in the old era, the cotton textile industry had relatively good achievements. From the establishment of the first cotton textile factory by Zhang Zhidong to the national liberation, it had been sixty years. During these sixty years, the country had a maximum of five million cotton spindles, and only 2.5 million of these five million cotton spindles belonged to Chinese merchants. The other 2.5 million spindles belonged to Japanese and British merchants. The machinery and equipment of Chinese-owned yarn factories were all purchased from foreign countries, and none were made in China. Now, in the ten years since liberation, the total number of cotton spindles in China has exceeded twice the five million spindles of the old era, and they are entirely owned by the Chinese people. Textile machinery is now entirely made in China, and some of the cotton textile machines made in China are exported to Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries. I carefully visited a cotton textile factory in Handan. The machinery was entirely made in China, and its performance was far superior to that of any country in the world. Can this kind of development not be said to be at the highest speed?

Because the reactionary ruling class was unwilling to spend money on industry, other factories were rare at that time, except for cotton textile factories. I remember in 1931, a few people were entrusted by the reactionary government at the time to prepare for the establishment of a synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant. After working for three years, they realized that the government was penniless. Therefore, they turned to public and private commercial banks and helped Yongli Company borrow 12 million yuan in puppet currency to set up a factory in Xiejia shop, Nanjing, with an annual output of 50,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. In 1934, Yongli sent people to the United States to purchase machinery, and shipments only began in 1937. A mere 50,000-ton fertilizer plant took seven years and a great deal of effort. Now, under the leadership of the Party, China can produce 1.33 million tons of fertilizer annually. During my trip to Northeast China, in addition to carefully visiting a very large fertilizer plant, I also saw a small fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia. In the future, most people's communes across the country can set up such a small nitrogen fertilizer plant themselves. The Party's policy of walking on two legs and combining large, medium, and small enterprises is the shortcut to achieving an annual output of 35 million tons of fertilizer.

At present, China's annual investment in industrial capital construction is not several billion or tens of billions of yuan, but hundreds of billions of yuan. Therefore, various industries can blossom and bear fruit in a planned, comprehensive, and high-speed manner across the country. At this conference, I was very excited to hear Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report. He said: "The final expenditure for 1959 was 52.77 billion yuan, of which 32.17 billion yuan was for economic construction. This fund was used for 1,341 above-norm construction projects under construction in 1959 (the investment limit for capital construction units varies. The investment limit for iron and steel complexes is 20 million yuan; the investment limit for the automobile manufacturing industry and coal mining industry is 10 million yuan; the investment limit for the textile industry is 5 million yuan), of which 671 were fully completed and partially completed and put into production, which means that almost two large enterprises were put into production every day. There were a total of 75,000 above-norm construction projects undertaken by counties and above, of which 54,000 were completed and put into production, with an average of 150 small and medium-sized enterprises put into production every day." In this way, more than 50,000 large, medium, and small enterprises are put into production in a year. Moreover, there were already many enterprises in production before, and more large, medium, and small enterprises will be put into production in the future. Isn't this kind of development an unprecedented high speed?

Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the Party, the annual investment and project arrangements are planned and most comprehensive. The new types of factories I saw during my visits to industrial construction in various places were not a small number of types, but a variety of large factories. What I saw in Handan City, Hebei Province, included not only iron and steel plants and cotton textile factories, but also a variety of other factories. What I saw in various parts of Northeast China included cable factories, heavy machinery factories, heavy-duty lathe factories, shipyards, train locomotive passenger car freight car manufacturing factories, motor manufacturing factories, automobile manufacturing factories, iron and steel plants, steel plants, steel plants, measuring tool and cutting tool manufacturing factories, fertilizer plants, dye plants, hydroelectric plants, glass factories, beet sugar factories, flax factories, etc., not less than twenty kinds. Moreover, it is said that 85% of the machines needed by the country can be made domestically. I remember before liberation, an industrial expert admitted to me: China could not even make iron nails and had to import them from abroad. This era is long gone.

II. Factory workers are working with soaring enthusiasm.

During my visit to factories in Northeast China, I saw that all the workers in the factories, under the brilliant light of the general line, were high-spirited and enthusiastic. During the Spring Festival, they did not take holidays themselves, but worked as usual, worked overtime every day, and refused to increase their wages. The reason is: China was originally a poor and blank country, and they want to "work hard for ten years" so that everyone can enjoy "happiness for ten thousand years." This spirit is a spirit of communist style and is unimaginable in capitalist countries. They believe that this is conscious and voluntary labor, and it is by no means the so-called "slave labor" slandered by capitalist countries. In fact, the workers in capitalist countries and the workers in socialist countries have a very big difference in essence. The workers in socialist countries feel that this is a country where the people are in charge, and the state is responsible for their own birth, old age, illness, death, and children's education. They have nothing to ask for except their salary income. Therefore, in addition to working selflessly and wholeheartedly, they have no other thoughts. This is also the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Unless they are on the scene and experience it from a longer period of practice, the staff of capitalist countries will absolutely not be able to understand it. At the same time, the Party's leadership method for factory production is also very wise and correct. In factory management, a method combining centralized leadership and large-scale mass movements is implemented, and workers participate in management and cadres participate in production. The method of internal three combinations and external three combinations is also adopted. The internal three combinations are the combination of workers in the factory and cadres and technicians in the factory; the external three combinations are the combination of the factory and industrial education and industrial research institutions outside the factory. In this way, all possible forces that can be united are united to make the greatest effort for the improvement of the work. When I visited industry in Northeast China, the factories were vigorously engaged in technological innovation. Everyone was using their minds, looking for tricks, and tapping potential, trying to mechanize and automate factory tools and machinery to reduce manpower and increase production. In the past two months, great achievements have been made. For example, the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute used to always lag behind the requirements of all parties in design work and was always in a passive position. Now, led by senior technicians, the calculation work has been changed to use electronic computers, and in the drawing work, various formats of drawings are printed in advance. In the future, in design, only numbers need to be filled in on the printed drawings, and there is no need to draw each piece. In this way, the design work for the whole year can be completed in forty-five days, freeing up a large number of people in the institute to do research work and go to various places to provide guidance. For example, the machines used in the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant were originally the most advanced machines in the Soviet Union, and they produced 50 cars per shift in two shifts a day. Now, it is necessary to carry out technological innovation on advanced machines to further develop the efficiency of mechanization and automation. At present, it has been achieved that the production per shift has tripled, that is, 150 vehicles can be produced per shift. This kind of spirit of daring to think and act can only be seen in socialist countries.

III. Industry and agriculture support each other.

The Party and the government put forward that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, which fully illustrates the importance of agriculture. Industry and agriculture support each other, and 80% of the raw materials for light industry come from agriculture. If agricultural products are poor, factories may be in danger of shutting down. Agriculture's support for industry is to provide the best raw materials sufficiently to industry, so that it can produce continuously throughout the year. The flax processing plant I saw in Harbin and the cotton textile factory I saw in Handan both have a sufficient supply of raw materials for the factory to produce day and night throughout the year. It fully demonstrates the support of agriculture for industry. At the same time, the mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, and chemicalization of modern agriculture all require industrial support. The large and small fertilizer plants I saw in Northeast China are the most important measures to support agriculture. I also saw many large factories in various places, which in name seem to be unrelated to agriculture, but these factories are also using various methods to support agriculture. For example, the Fengman Hydropower Station in Jilin City has helped two people's communes in the Jilin area achieve electrification in the past two and a half months; it has also surveyed and designed several small hydropower stations and two hydraulic power stations for four people's communes, including Wulihezi; and it has manufactured a small 20-kilovolt-ampere generator for a commune in the Jilin area. For example, Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 1, in addition to completing large lathes, also manufactured a large number of simple lathes and a large number of diesel engines for irrigation to support the people's communes. These are all examples of the communist style of great cooperation and the best example of industry supporting agriculture.

IV. The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China's industrial construction

The great achievements of China's industrial construction today are inseparable from the Soviet Union's selfless assistance. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union helped China build 166 large-scale construction projects. In August 1958 and February 1959, the Soviet Union signed two more agreements with China, stipulating that the Soviet Union would help China build another 125 industrial projects. In the past ten years, for the sake of China's industrial construction, hundreds of design units and thousands of factories in the Soviet Union have undertaken arduous tasks of design and equipment supply. More than 7,000 outstanding experts have come to China to help with construction work, and they have cultivated more than 8,000 technical talents for China in the Soviet Union. During this visit, I saw the Central Washing Plant, Cable Factory, Steelmaking and Steel Plant, Chemical Plant, Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Manufacturing Plant, Motor Plant, Flax Plant, First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Dye Plant, and Fengman Hydropower Station, which were built with the help of the Soviet Union. Everywhere, people explained in detail the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to us and the touching facts of the hard work of experts from the Soviet Union. Today, the strength of the socialist camp is incomparably strong, which is extremely helpful in accelerating our socialist construction.

The above is the inspiration I gained during the visit. In general, the country is stronger, the people's lives have been greatly improved, and it is developing forward most comprehensively and at the highest speed. The main reason is entirely due to the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the wise and correct leadership of the Party. What we have hoped for in our lives is the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people. Now that we have recognized the path and direction of advancement, our decision is very simple, that is, to strengthen self-transformation, unite around the Party, obey the leadership of the Party, take the socialist road, and contribute our strength and ideas to the continued glory, prosperity, and strength of the country and the people.

专栏：

    从参观工业建设所得到的启发
    邹秉文委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我竭诚拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，完全同意陈叔通副主席代表政协常委会所作的报告。
    我现在要谈谈我从参观邯郸和东北的工业建设所得到的启发。
    我是一个农业工作者，所以过去三年视察的对象，主要是农业生产、农业机构和农民生活诸方面，工业方面则看得不多。但最近半年来，由于全国政协委员会有参观团的组织，我两次花了一个多月的时间，参观了河北邯郸市和东北三省的工业建设。我所得到的印象是极其深刻的。我的感觉是，我国工业建设的成就，和农业一样，是突飞猛进的，是了不起的，是旧时代的知识分子所梦想不到的。这个工业建设的巨大成就的原因，也和农业一样，是完全由于社会主义制度的无比优越性和党的英明而正确的领导。在各地的参观中，我得到不少的启发，特简要提出，请大家指正。
    一、我国工业建设正在最全面地最高速度地发展着
    工业建设的辉煌成就，说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性和党的英明正确领导。好些旧时代的消费城市，现在都是工厂林立一变而为工业城市。像河北邯郸市在解放前，只有两座被破坏了的矿井，一座年产三万吨铁的磁山铁矿和几座简陋的小型工厂。目前，已拥有很多工业企业，工业职工人数已增到十三万五千人；抚顺在日本侵略统治时期，城市居民只有三十万人，日本人就有十万人。现在由于工业的发展，城市居民就有一百五十万人，其中工人占三十万人。所有日本人都被送回本国去了。
    旧时代所办的工业，以棉纺织业比较有些成绩，自张之洞首创棉纺织厂到全国解放时，已有六十年，在此六十年中，全国最多的时候只有五百万棉纱锭，而这五百万棉纱锭，属于中国商人者又仅二百五十万锭，其它二百五十万锭，则属于日本和英国的商人。华商纱厂的机器设备，件件都从外国购进，没有一件是本国制造的。现在，解放后十年内，我国所有棉纱锭数已超过旧时代五百万锭的一倍有余，完全属于中国人民所有。纺织机器更完全为我国自造，而国内所造的棉纺织机，且有一部分出口，销于东南亚和中东国家。我在邯郸曾仔细参观了一个棉纺织厂，机器完全本国自制，性能的优良，远胜于世界任何国家。这种发展情况，能说不是最高速度的吗？
    由于反动统治阶级不愿意拿出钱来办工业，所以在当时，除去棉纺织厂外，其他工厂真是凤毛麟角。记得1931年，有几个人曾受当时反动政府的委托去筹办一个合成氨化肥厂，忙了三年，才知道政府是一钱不名的。如是乃转而谋诸公私商业银行，帮永利公司借了伪币一千二百万元，才得在南京卸甲店筹设了一个年产五万吨硫氨工厂。1934年永利派人赴美采购机器，1937年才开始出货。区区五万吨的化肥厂，竟用了七年的时间，费了九牛二虎之力。现在，在党的领导下，已使我国能年产化肥一百三十三万吨。我这次赴东北，除仔细参观了一个极大的化肥厂外，还看见了一个年产八百吨合成氨的小化肥厂。将来全国大多数人民公社都可以自设一个像这样的小氮肥厂。党的两条腿走路和大中小相结合的方针，是实现年产三千五百万吨化肥的终南捷径。
    我国现时每年对于工业基本建设的投资，不是几亿元几十亿元，而是几百亿元。因此各种工业都可以有计划地、全面地和最高速度地在全国各地开花结果。这次大会，我很兴奋地听到李先念副总理的报告。他说：“1959年决算支出五百二十七亿七千万元，其中有三百二十一亿七千万元是经济建设费。这笔款子用于1959年施工的限额以上建设项目（基本建设单位的投资限额各有不同。钢铁联合企业投资限额为两千万元；汽车制造工业、采煤工业的投资限额为一千万元；纺织工业投资限额为五百万元。）共有一千三百四十一个，其中全部建成和部分建成投入生产的有六百七十一个，即是差不多每天有两个大型企业投入生产。县以上各级所兴办的限额以下建设项目共有七万五千个，其中建设完工投入生产的有五万四千个，平均每天有一百五十个中小型企业投入生产。”这样看来，一年之中就有五万多个大中小型企业投入生产。而且以前本已有不少的企业已在生产，以后更有更多数的大中小型企业投入生产。这种发展，难道还不是史无前例的最高速度吗？
    由于党的英明正确领导，每年投资和项目的安排都是有计划的，最全面的。我这次在各地参观工业建设，所看到的新型工厂，不是少数种类，而是多种多样的大型工厂。我在河北邯郸市所看见的不仅有炼铁厂，棉纺织厂，而且还有多种多样的其他工厂。在东北各地所看到的，就包括有电缆厂、重型机械厂、重型车床厂、造船厂、火车机车客车货车制造厂、电机制造厂、汽车制造厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂、钢材厂、量具刃具制造厂、化肥厂、染料厂、水电厂、玻璃厂、甜菜制糖厂、亚麻厂等不下二十余种。并且听说国家所需要的机器，有85％已都能自制。记得解放前有一个工业专家向我承认：我国连铁钉都不能自造，须由国外输入。这种时代，早已一去不复返了。
    二、工厂职工干劲冲天
    这次我到东北各地的工厂，看到厂内所有职工，在总路线光辉照耀下，都是斗志昂扬、干劲冲天。在春节，他们自己不放假，照常工作，每天加班，拒绝增加工资。理由是：中国原是一穷二白的国家，他们要“辛苦十年”使得大家能享受“幸福万年”。这种精神，是共产主义风格的精神，是资本主义国家所不能想像的。他们认为这是自觉自愿的劳动，而决不是资本主义国家诬蔑的所谓“奴隶劳动”。事实上，资本主义国家的职工与社会主义国家的职工实质上有极大的区别。社会主义国家的职工觉得这是一个人民自己当家的国家，自己生老病死以及子女教育都有国家负责，自己除薪资收入外即别无所求。所以除了无私地、一心一意地为工作而努力外，亦即无其他想头。这也就是社会主义制度的无比优越性。资本主义国家的工作人员，除非亲临其境，从较长时间的实践中来体会，是绝对不能够理解的。同时，党对工厂生产的领导方法也很英明正确。工厂管理上实行集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方法，采用工人参加管理，干部参加生产。又采取内三结合和外三结合的方法，内三结合是厂内工人和厂内的干部、技术人员相结合；外三结合是工厂和厂外的工业教育及工业研究机构相结合。这么一来，使得所有可能团结的力量都团结起来，共同为工作的改进而尽最大的努力。我参观东北工业时，各工厂正在热火朝天地大搞技术革新。大家都在用心思、找窍门、挖潜力，想把工厂工具机械化了，自动化了，以减少人力，增加生产。两个月来，已经有很大的成就，如沈阳铝镁设计院，从前设计工作总是跟不上各方面的要求，处处立于被动地位，现在由老技术员带头把计算工作改用了电子计算机，画图工作，先印好各种格式的图纸，以后设计，只须在印就的图纸上填进数字，不必逐件画图，如此一来，就把全年的设计工作在四十五天内做完，解放了大批人力在院内做研究工作和赴各地作指导工作。又如长春第一汽车制造厂，所用的机器本是苏联最先进的机器，每天两班，每班生产汽车五十辆。现在，要在先进的机器上，从事技术革新，使它更发展机械化、自动化的效能。目前已经作到每班生产翻三番，即每班可产一百五十辆。这种敢想敢干的精神，也只能见之于社会主义制度的国家。
    三、工业农业互相支援
    党和政府提出农业是国民经济的基础，就更充分地说明了农业的重要性。工业与农业是互相支援的，轻工业原料有80％出自农业。农产品倘或歉收，工厂就有停工之虞。农业支援工业就是把极好的原料充足地供给工业，使之周年不息的生产。我这次在哈尔滨看见的亚麻加工厂和在邯郸所见的棉纺织厂，都有极充足的原料供给工厂周年日夜生产。充分地显示了农业对工业的支援。同时，现代化农业的机械化、水利化、电气化、化学化又无一样不需要工业支援的。我这次在东北所看到的大型、小型化肥厂，都是支援农业最重要的措施。我又在各地看见好些大型工厂，在名义上看是和农业无关的，可是这些工厂也在采用各种方式去支援农业。例如吉林市丰满水电站在两个半月以来，帮助吉林地区两个人民公社实现了电气化；又为五里河子等四个人民公社勘测设计了几个小型水电站和两个水动力站；并为吉林区一个公社制造了一台二十千伏安的小型发电机。又如沈阳机床一厂在完成大型车床以外，还制造出大批的简易车床和大批的灌溉用柴油机，以支援人民公社。这些都是共产主义大协作的风格，也是工业支援农业最好的榜样。
    四、苏联对我国工业建设的无私援助
    我国今日工业建设的巨大成就，是和苏联无私的援助分不开的。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国建设了一百六十六个规模宏大的建设项目，1958年8月和1959年2月苏联又和我国签订了两项协定，规定苏联将帮助我国再建设一百二十五个工业项目。在过去十年内，为了中国的工业建设，苏联国内有成百的设计单位和成千的工厂承担了繁重的设计和供应设备的任务，有七千余位优秀专家来我国帮助建设工作，并且为我国在苏联培植了八千多名技术人才。我此次参观在各地看见了苏联帮助我们建设的中央洗选厂、电缆厂、炼钢和钢材厂、化工厂、量具刃具制造厂、电机厂、亚麻厂、第一汽车制造厂、染料厂、丰满水电站。处处都有人详细地说明苏联对我们的无私援助，和来自苏联专家们辛勤劳动的感人事实。今日社会主义阵营力量无比的强大，对加速我们社会主义建设是极有帮助的。
    以上所述，是我个人在参观中所得到的启发。总的说来，是国家强大了，人民生活大大改善了，而且正在最全面地、最高速度地向前发展。其主要原因，完全是由于社会主义制度的无比优越性和党的英明正确领导。我们一生所期望的就是国家的强盛，人民的幸福。今天既然认清了前进的路途和方向，我们对自己的决定，也就很简单，就是要加强自我改造，团结在党的周围，服从党的领导，走社会主义的道路，并且有力出力，有计献计为国家，人民的继续光荣富强而奋斗。
