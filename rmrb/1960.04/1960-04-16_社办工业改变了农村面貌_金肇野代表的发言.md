Fellow Delegates:
I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and will resolutely implement them in my work. I would like to report on the issue of commune-run industry in the rural areas of Liaoning Province as follows.

The Central Committee’s "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" pointed out that "People's Communes must vigorously develop industry" and "The industrial production of People's Communes must be closely integrated with agricultural production, primarily serving the development of agriculture and the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, while also meeting the daily needs of commune members." Since the realization of people's communes in rural areas of our province in 1958, we have, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, developed industrial production in various communes in light of local conditions. This instruction from the Central Committee reflects the urgent desire of the vast number of cadres and masses in rural areas after communization. Our province has a relatively large proportion of industry, and both urban and rural labor forces are very tight. Also, because of the relatively large proportion of industry, the industrial demand for agricultural grain, non-staple foods, and light industrial raw materials is growing, which requires rural areas to continuously transport labor, grain, non-staple foods, and raw materials to industry. Agriculture, in turn, needs industrial assistance to increase the output of agricultural products and increase the commodity rate of agricultural products. However, since the Great Leap Forward, all aspects of the agricultural front, like other fronts, have been developing at a high speed, and labor and animal power have become even more strained. In order to improve work efficiency, in order to liberate labor from heavy physical labor and trivial daily life labor, a series of technical transformations are required, mechanization and semi-mechanization are required to replace manual operations, and a large number of labor forces must be drawn from the logistics aspects such as the catering industry and the animal husbandry industry, which consume the most labor, to the production front. This requires people's communes to run farm tool factories, agricultural machinery factories, and various processing factories to serve logistics. In order to increase production, it is necessary to run fertilizer plants and pesticide plants and other industries. After more than a year of efforts, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the active creation of the broad masses, various communes have successively established various factories and mines, and many commune-run factories have assembled equipment such as lathes, planers, drilling machines, milling machines, cupolas, electric welding machines, etc. Many areas have formed complete networks for the manufacture and repair of farm tools, capable of manufacturing plowshares and new farm tools themselves, and some communes are even able to manufacture power. Recently, the state-owned factories and mines in our province have also been linked with the people's communes respectively, and each factory and mine has established a fixed support relationship with the rural people's communes. This has a tremendous effect not only on accelerating agricultural technology transformation and realizing the four modernizations of agriculture, but also on further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and accelerating the process of national industrialization.

I would like to take a little of everyone's time here to briefly introduce the industrial situation of a people's commune in our province. From the industrial development of this commune, we can see that the Party's instruction that "People's Communes must vigorously develop industry" is completely correct, and we can also see that commune-run industry is the only way to promote agricultural development and realize agricultural modernization.

The Lutun People's Commune in Gaiping County in the southern part of Liaoning Province, when they established the commune in the autumn of 1958, merged three townships, with a total of six small handicraft workshops: two iron furnaces (shoeing horses, forging hoes), one iron kettle welding shop, one wood factory (making coffins), one willow basket weaving shop, and one sewing shop. This was their industrial base. In terms of tools, there was an old lathe and an air pump, both of which were rusty scrap iron that had been in disrepair for many years and could not be used. What could be used were a few hammers, pliers, saws, planes, and other scattered small tools. Only a few sewing machines in the sewing shop could be regarded as modern semi-mechanized tools. In terms of technicians, there was a turner and a fitter in the iron furnace, but they could not play their role at that time (now they have become the backbone of commune-run industry). Because the situation of commune-run industry was like this at that time, it could not meet the needs of agriculture for production materials. Although the commune had six tractors, even a small problem had to be repaired in the county seat. General production equipment relied on supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase goods from other places, and often could not supply the needs of production in time. The situation of the Great Leap Forward had already started on all fronts, large-scale deep plowing was carried out in agriculture, autumn harvest was very tight, water conservancy construction was booming, and short-distance transportation was extremely busy. Everywhere needed people, vehicles, and tools. At this time, state-owned large industries were also leaping forward, requiring rural support for labor. The general trend and the compelling situation, in order to solve the shortage of labor and animal power, the provincial party committee instructed that the current task of commune-run industry was to solve the mechanization and semi-mechanization problems in the important links of various production departments. According to the instructions of the higher authorities, the commune party committee analyzed the current situation and decided to first change the iron furnace into an agricultural machinery factory to carry out tool reform. At this time, the commune had more than 1.8 million catties of apples, more than 10 million catties of cotton, more than 20 million catties of grain, and other agricultural products that urgently needed to be transported. Seeing that the weather was freezing cold, if they did not speed up plowing, the land would be sealed by heavy snow, and the apples would rot if they could not be transported out. For this reason, it was decided to rush to manufacture deep plows, mountain plows, and double-wheeled double-shared plows, and to make all 400 large carts into roller bearings; to expand the wood factory to manufacture apple packaging equipment; to expand the sewing shop into a clothing factory, establish a shoe factory and a grain and rice processing factory, so as to free a large number of female laborers from the family; to establish a building materials factory, burning bricks and tiles to prepare materials for building and expanding factories; to establish an agricultural and sideline product processing factory to make full use of rotten fruit and bran. Although this decision was supported by the majority of cadres and masses, some people believed that rural communes could only engage in agricultural production, and running industry was a matter for the state. Moreover, without equipment and technical workers, how could they do it! To run it, the state had to provide equipment and investment; some people did not say it in person but discussed it behind their backs, saying things like "fooling around, never heard of farmers running factories. Cadres are whimsical, thinking about what to do. If they can run factories, the state doesn't need to run them." and so on, cold words and sarcasm, holding a skeptical attitude towards commune-run industry, without confidence. Some workers also felt that there were many difficulties, believing that roller bearings were precise things and could not be made without equipment and technology. According to this ideological situation, the commune party committee conducted analysis, mobilization, debate, and criticism. First of all, break superstition, liberate the mind, and encourage workers to think boldly and create boldly. As a result, three workers created two plates of roller bearings in one day and night. When the news spread, those with conservative ideas and skeptical attitudes still did not believe it, but when they saw the bright roller bearings that were the same as the ones they bought, they had to admit defeat. The successful trial production of roller bearings gave great encouragement to cadres and the masses. Industry was not mysterious and unattainable. The masses' enthusiasm was high, and each team successively established furnaces. In less than a month, 400 large carts were all roller-bearingized, and they were continuously improved later, and they further researched bearings and made foreign roller-bearing styles with inner and outer sleeves. Last year, 140 new cars were equipped with this kind of foreign roller bearing, meeting the needs of transportation, and the masses' enthusiasm for running industry was even higher. Comrades, why do I want to talk about this process? This is a beginning. Everything is difficult at the beginning. Breaking through this level greatly liberated the mind, making people realize that everything is done by people. Others can do it, and we can do it too. As long as we listen to the Party, mobilize the masses, and everyone uses their brains, there is nothing that cannot be done. From the successful trial production of roller bearings, people dared to imagine other industries, and they could be run. Everyone believed that the decision of the commune party committee was not "fooling around", but could be realized, and many other industries could be run. At this time, the Party's prestige was even higher among the masses. People said: Believing in the Party and following the Party is never wrong. The Party organization of the commune further experienced from here Chairman Mao's instructions to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, constantly struggle with right-leaning conservative thoughts, constantly grasp the ideological dynamics of the masses, and give play to the wisdom and drive of the masses, there is no unfulfilled revolutionary cause.

After the masses were mobilized, a surge of vigorously developing industry swept across all 62 villages and hamlets in the commune. Steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, mining, from the manufacture of agricultural tools to the production of small hardware for daily use, from native fertilizer to pesticides, as well as making clothes, making shoes, making pickles, brewing wine, tanning leather, burning bricks, burning tiles, repairing clocks, etc., a total of more than 30 industries, the commune directly runs 54 medium and small factories and mines, with 1,101 employees. Each production team (a total of 30 teams) also runs one to three factories, a total of more than 100. Without technicians, they investigated and mobilized retired old workers in each team and asked them to come out as masters. Without machines, they bought scrap products, repaired them, fitted parts, and modified them. Without benches, they used water troughs as bases. Without factory buildings, the commune members voluntarily moved out and lent them to the commune to run factories. Everyone's enthusiasm was growing. At that time, when you walked to that village, you would see many primary school students collecting scrap iron and digging scrap iron. Every village and hamlet was boiling. Those with money contributed money, those with wood donated wood, those with steel donated steel, those with bricks and tiles donated bricks and tiles. Everyone was dedicated to building factories for the commune. At that time, more than 120 tons of scrap copper and broken iron were collected, and more than 100,000 yuan of cash and materials were collected, solving the difficulties of funds and raw materials. At that time, when you went to the mountains, you would see crowds of people all over the mountains and plains looking for mines, opening mines, digging fluorite, and digging mica; an old retired worker named Zhang Shucheng took the initiative to find the commune party committee. He said that he knew that there was a fluorite mine source on that mountain. If the commune decided to mine it, he would be willing to lead the way to mine it. The commune immediately allocated 20 people to him, led by him, and now it has developed into a mining team of more than 100 people. Last year, the commune mined more than 8,000 tons, supporting the national industrial construction. Various factories were established, and the small town of Lutun, where the commune was located, has since changed its bleak appearance. Men and women who had never participated in production in the past have also been involved in the wave of vigorously developing industry. At that time, almost every day, you could see workers reporting victory with gongs and drums on the streets. They joyfully presented new products to the Party.

After the commune-run industry developed, some cadres in some factories and mines showed a tendency to be greedy for large-scale foreign products and one-sidedly pursuing profits. For example, the agricultural machinery factory in Lutun town, with four or five machine tools, wanted to expand into a large factory, requiring large-scale factory buildings to be built and new machines to be installed. They were unwilling to provide agricultural production with agricultural tools and wanted to process them for large industries; they also saw that there was a large profit from foreign wellheads, so they blindly manufactured wellheads, causing a large backlog; the Shuangtaizi production team saw that mining profits were high, so they secretly took workers from the agricultural machinery factory to the mountains to mine, leaving only two workers who shoeed horses, almost stagnating. According to this situation, the commune party committee conducted ideological education, clarifying that commune industry must be closely integrated with agricultural production, primarily serving "the development of agriculture and the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, while also meeting the daily needs of commune members." Under the conditions of manpower and other resources, according to the principle of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials," serving the national large industry and the socialist market. The commune party committee resolutely implemented this policy. From February to April 1959, it carried out rectification work on various factories and mines, streamlining the redundant personnel who did not directly participate in production and transferring them to the agricultural front, so that the industries that were open directly served agriculture. General industry engaged in agriculture during the busy farming season and worked during the slack season, combining agriculture and industry and mutually integrating them, so that commune-run industry embarked on a correct development path. After rectification, the direction was clear, and the enthusiasm of the employees was even greater. According to needs, they built and expanded factories with their own strength. If the equipment of each factory could be produced by themselves, they tried their best to manufacture it themselves. Without technicians, they trained themselves. In addition to using the method of masters leading apprentices, they also sent apprentices to state-owned large factories to study, and they also ran a technical night school themselves, taught by old workers. Every day, 40 to 50 young people participated in the study, and the technical level was constantly improving, gradually mastering the performance of the machines. Using the advanced experience of ants gnawing bones, they trial-produced many new products. Now they have been able to manufacture and have manufactured: simple lathes, motors, water pumps, diesel engine oil nozzles, rice stirrers, pulverizers, various plows, shares, shovels, hoes, seeders, rice transplanters, weeding machines, tractors, lawn mowers, weeding machines, bundling machines, drilling machines, large and small vehicles, etc. In 1959, they manufactured 14 lathes, equipped factories in each team, manufactured 120,000 pieces of small agricultural tools, improved 50,000 pieces of agricultural tools, 8,700 pieces of new agricultural tools, 125 large carts, 2,480 pieces of water conservancy tools, and 4,000 tons of native fertilizer and native pesticides, supplying the needs of agricultural production. In terms of daily necessities, they produced jars, basins, pots, knives, spoons, cloth shoes, leather shoes, clothes (98,000 machine-made clothes, an average of 1.7 pieces per person), boxes, cabinets, buckets, baskets, etc.; in terms of building materials, they produced bricks, tiles, hinges, latches, buckles, screws, etc.; in terms of non-staple foods, they produced vermicelli, pickles, fruit wine, etc. The total output value in 1959 was 4.6 million yuan, plus the industrial output value of each team, totaling 8.54 million yuan. Because commune-run industry was mainly for agricultural service, in terms of agricultural tools, it saved 225,000 workdays of labor and 30,000 workdays of animal power, and improved people's lives, increasing commune accumulation. In 1959, industrial accumulation alone reached 519,000 yuan, buying three tractors and three cars for agriculture, and establishing a power station in Shuangtaizi Village. In addition to industrial electricity, 300 commune members received lighting. The vast number of commune members were extremely satisfied, and the commune industry was greatly supported by the masses.

In 1960, under the encouragement of the continued Great Leap Forward and the great technical revolution in the country, the Lutun People's Commune also achieved a leap in its commune-run industry. Like industries all over the country, they welcomed the first year of the great 1960s with a good start. The Gaiping County People's Committee gave Lutun Commune an industrial target of 10 million yuan this year (excluding team-run industry), but they completed 9.27 million yuan in the first quarter (excluding team-run industry). The enthusiasm of the employees is getting higher and higher, and technical innovations are emerging one after another. When entering 1960, they put forward the resounding slogan of "increasing production without increasing people," and quickly set off a production competition upsurge centered on technical revolution throughout the commune, with everyone using their brains and hands, and everyone offering suggestions. It's really you chasing me, everyone wants to be an inventor, and each workshop has organized an innovation team to engage in mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, automatic connection lines, etc. In more than two months, they put forward more than 500 suggestions and realized 63 innovations. The more the employees researched, the more interested they became. Everyone was fascinated by invention and creation, and some workers took the factory as their home, burying themselves in the workshop day and night, not knowing fatigue and forgetting to eat. When they encountered difficulties that could not be solved, they went out to seek advice from teachers and friends. A communist friendship and cooperation also set off between the workshops, working together to create a new tool. After more than two months of efforts, the wood factory has been completely mechanized. Sawing wood, punching holes, planing boards, and turning rivets do not require manual labor; the mechanical factory's hammering, blowing, and stirring iron have also been mechanized, and the belt lathe has been removed the belt, and a small electric roller has been installed on the lathe, realizing semi-automation; grain and rice processing has achieved automation, with continuous operation, and no longer requires people to pour rice over and over again in the middle. Due to the continuous innovation of technology, work efficiency has been improved, saving a lot of labor, and engaged in the expanded reproduction of industry. In the first quarter, in addition to repairing all agricultural machinery, they also manufactured more than 12,460 pieces of agricultural tools (including new agricultural tools) for water conservancy and spring plowing and sowing. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire commune has reached more than 50%. The canteen and pig raising and other logistics departments of the Litun production team of the commune have all achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization. General mechanical agricultural tool repair can be done with minor repairs without leaving the team, and medium and large-sized machine tool repairs without leaving the commune, which has paved the way for promoting the four modernizations of agriculture and liberating heavy physical labor. They plan to manufacture another 1,140 pulverizers, rice stirrers, etc., and 222 motors, diesel engines, lathes, water pumps, etc. throughout the year. In April, they will make 15 native tractors (diesel engine legs) and various improved agricultural tools, which is estimated to save 440,000 workdays of labor and 60,000 workdays of animal power for agriculture throughout the year, and enable all commune members to eat machine-made rice. Other chemical fertilizers and pesticides are also being produced in large quantities. In terms of clothing, they plan to make more than 110,000 pieces this year (excluding team-run clothing factories). Using the experience of Tianjin in saving cloth, it not only saves rural women's time, but also concentrates on saving cloth; other production of 10,000 pairs of leather shoes and cloth shoes, 800 tons of soybean oil, 4,000 sets of jars and basins, as well as pickles, starch, canned food, etc., to supply necessities for life; more than 20 million red bricks to supply construction needs; 133,000 tons of fluorite to support national industry; and also hardware and groceries, etc., to serve the commune's production and life. The total industrial output value of the commune is planned to be 40 million yuan (the county gave the commune a target of 10 million yuan). 9.27 million yuan has been completed in the first quarter (excluding team-run), and all employees are confident that: under the illumination of the Party's general line, a great boost in energy can achieve this task. In order to achieve the plan, the employees are enthusiastically carrying out technical innovations, and are currently studying the automation of sewing machines (without stepping on the foot), the mechanization of brick kiln blasting and blank making, and the mechanization of shoe making, etc. It is expected that good news will be reported in early April.

The vigorous development of industry by rural people's communes has accelerated the process of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, making people feel that agricultural production is not so difficult. People who were not content with rural life in the past now feel interested in rural life. Some young girls who used to run to the city now settle down, feeling that rural life is getting better and better. Making clothes, making shoes, and cooking can also be replaced by machines, thus freeing themselves from the troubles of the four "tai"s: middle table, stove table, mill table, and kang table, and stepping onto the glory of the four "tai"s: hero table, competition table, leap forward table, and cultural table. Farmers can not only grow the land, but also learn to operate machines. They not only learn agricultural technology, but also learn industrial technology. After the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification in various production departments of rural people's communes, labor productivity has been greatly improved, which has created conditions for intensive cultivation and improving the yield per unit area, and created conditions for supporting national industrial construction and transporting labor to state-owned large industries. The grain unit yield of this commune increased by 30% in 1959 compared to 1958, and other crops also had varying degrees of growth. In terms of labor, more than 3,000 people were transported to large industries after communization. Due to the development of industry in various villages and hamlets, the rural economy and life have prospered, and the cultural life that follows has also prospered; factories, shops, schools, telephones, broadcasting, post and telecommunications, savings banks, clinics, etc. have been universally established. The commune members sing:

The People's Commune shines brightly, the motherland has changed its appearance; tractors run in the fields, and machines sing in the villages; grinding rice and making clothes do not require hands, and planting and weeding save strength; turning home at dusk, the canteen food is sweet and fragrant; lying on the kang listening to the radio, reading books and newspapers is joyful; everyone respects Chairman Mao, and is endlessly grateful to the Communist Party.

Indeed, in the past, remote villages, poor and lower-middle peasants have been frowning for generations, and their hearts were shrouded in a cloud; but now, they are happy, and they say: Chairman Mao shines in everyone's heart like the sun. An old man surnamed Guo in Lanchi Village, who is over 60 years old, said: I never dreamed that I would live such a happy life. Not to mention eating and wearing well, I can talk to my relatives who work in other places without leaving the village (there are telephones in the village), and postmen deliver the money sent by relatives directly to my hands. I don't have to leave the village to buy things, and I have my own factory. Who can do these good things for the working people without the Communist Party? Without the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, how could farmers run factories! Commune-run industry has only been around for more than a year, and it has already shown its brilliance. When they heard on the radio last year that right-leaning opportunists were slandering the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, some people jumped up and shouted: "You right-wingers, don't talk nonsense with your eyes closed. Come to our commune and see, if it weren't for the Great Leap Forward, could farmers run factories? If it weren't for the People's Commune, would we have such a good time?"

I am only talking about the example of this commune-run industry here. Under the leadership of the Party, they have launched a mass movement, mobilized the masses, relied on their own efforts, and started from scratch. Of course, this is not the only commune like this. Due to the importance attached to commune-run industry by the Party's provincial and municipal committees, especially in the last two months, the provincial and municipal committees have mobilized state-owned enterprises to support agriculture. The development of commune-run industry has been very rapid, and the face of the countryside is undergoing rapid changes.

However, commune-run industry is only a beginning. There are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, we lack experience in the operation and management of enterprises. We must continue to work hard to learn Mao Zedong Thought, continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, hold high the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, earnestly implement the Party's policies on commune-run industry, and push commune-run industry to a new climax, and strive to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification.

### 社办工业改变了农村面貌  金肇野代表的发言

专栏：

    社办工业改变了农村面貌
    金肇野代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告，并在工作中坚决贯彻执行。我仅就辽宁省农村人民公社社办工业问题汇报以下情况。
    在中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“人民公社必须大办工业”“人民公社的工业生产，必须同农业生产密切结合，首先为发展农业和实现农业机械化、电气化服务，同时为满足社员日常生活需要服务。”我省自1958年农村实现人民公社化以来，就根据中央的指示，在各公社里因地制宜的先后发展了工业生产。中央这个指示正是农村广大干部和群众在公社化以后的迫切愿望。我省工业比重较大，城市和农村的劳动力都很紧张，也由于工业比重较大，工业对农业的粮食、副食品以及轻工业原料的要求日益增长，这就需要农村不断的向工业输送劳动力，粮食、副食和原料，而农业则需要工业的援助，以增加农产品的产量和提高农产品的商品率。但是，大跃进以来，农业战线上各个方面也和其他战线一样在高速度的发展，劳力畜力就更显得十分紧张，为了提高工效，为了使劳动力从笨重的体力劳动中和繁琐的生活事务劳动中解放出来，便要求一系列的技术改造，要求机械化和半机械化来代替人的手工操作，要求从耗费劳力最多的饮食业、饲畜业等后勤方面抽出大批劳动力到生产战线上来，这就要求人民公社举办农具厂、农业机械厂，以及为后勤服务的各种加工厂。为了提高产量要求办化肥厂和农药厂等等工业。我们经过一年多的努力，根据中央的指示和广大群众的积极创造、各公社都先后办起了各种各样的厂、矿，并有许多社办工厂装配了车床、刨床、钻床、铣床、化铁炉、电焊机等等设备，许多地区已形成了完整的农具制造和修配网，能够自己制造犁铧、新式农具，也有些社自己能够制造动力。最近，我省各国营厂矿又与各人民公社分别挂钩，每个厂矿都分别与农村人民公社建立了固定的支援关系，这不仅对加速农业技术改造和实现农业四化有巨大的作用，而且对进一步巩固工农联盟和加快国家工业化的进程也有着极其重大深远的意义。
    我想在这里占用大家一点时间，简要地介绍一下我省一个人民公社的社办工业情况，从这个社的工业发展情况可以体现到党的“人民公社必须大办工业”的指示的完全正确，也可以看出来社办工业乃是促进农业发展，实现农业现代化的必经之路。
    辽宁省南部地区盖平县的蘆屯人民公社，他们在1958年秋建立公社的当时，三个乡合并起来，共有六个小型手工业作坊：铁炉两个（挂马掌，打镐头）、焊铁壶的一个、木器厂一个（做棺材）、编柳条筐的一个和一个缝纫铺。这就是他们的工业基础。在工具方面，有一台破旧车床和一台气泵，都是年久失修，生了锈的废铁，不能使用了。能够使用的是几把锤子、钳子、锯、刨子等等零星的小工具，只有缝纫铺里几台缝纫机算作近代的半机械化工具了。在技术工人方面，铁炉有一名车工一名钳工，当时也未能发挥作用（现在已成为社办工业的骨干了）。因为当时社办工业的情况是这个样子，它就不能满足农业对生产资料的需要，虽然公社有六台拖拉机，而发生一点小毛病都得到县城去修理，一般生产上的用具是依靠供销社从外地进货，往往不能及时地供应生产上的需要。而大跃进的形势已经在各个战线上开展起来，农业上大规模地进行深耕，秋收又十分紧张，水利建设蓬勃的发展，短途运输异常繁忙，到处要人、要车、要工具。这时国营大工业也在跃进，要求农村支援劳动力。大势所趋，形势逼人，为了解决劳力畜力的紧张，省委指示社办工业的当前任务是要解决各个生产部门的重要环节的机械化和半机械化问题，公社党委根据上级指示，分析了当前形势，便决定首先把铁炉改为农业机械厂，进行工具改革。这时该社有一百八十多万斤苹果，一千多万斤棉花，二千多万斤粮食和其他一些农产品急于运输，眼看天寒地冻，如不加紧耕翻就要大雪封地，苹果运不出就要冻烂。为此，便决定赶制深耕犁、山地犁、双轮双铧犁，并把四百台大车全部滚珠轴承化；扩大木器厂，制造苹果包装用具；扩大缝纫铺为被服厂，建立制鞋厂和粮米加工厂，以便把大批的妇女劳动力从家庭中解放出来；建立建筑材料厂，烧砖烧瓦为建立和扩大厂房准备材料；建立农副产品加工厂，把烂果糠麸充分利用起来。这个决定，虽然受到多数干部和群众的拥护，但也有少数人认为农村公社只能搞农业生产，办工业是国家的事情，而且没有设备，没有技术工人，怎么能搞得了！要办，就得国家给设备给投资；也有人当面不说背后议论，说什么“瞎胡闹，从来没听说过农民办工厂。干部异想天开，想啥干啥。他们能办工厂，国家就不要办了。”等等，冷言冷语，对社办工业抱怀疑态度，没有信心。在工人中也有人觉得困难重重，认为滚珠是精密的东西，没设备没技术搞不出来。公社党委根据这种思想情况，进行了分析、动员、辩论、批判。首先破除迷信，解放思想，鼓励工人大胆想，大胆创造。结果在一昼夜间三个工人搞出了两盘滚珠，消息传出去，有保守思想、抱怀疑态度的人还不相信，可是一看到明亮亮的滚珠和买来的一样，不能不认输了。滚珠试制的成功，给干部和群众极大鼓舞，工业也不是神秘不可攀的了。群众情绪高涨，各队都陆续建立起烘炉来，全社遍地开花，不到一个月时间，四百辆大车便全部滚珠轴承化了，而且以后陆续改进，进一步研究轴承，又制成内外带套的洋滚珠式的了。去年一百四十辆新车都装备了这种洋滚珠，满足了运输的需要，群众对办工业的情绪更高了。同志们，我为什么要讲这个过程？这是一个开端，什么事都是开头难，突破这个关，就大大解放了思想，使人们认识到什么事都是人做的，别人能做，我们也能做，只要听党的话，发动群众，大家开动脑筋，没有办不到的事情。从滚珠轴承试制的成功，人们就敢于设想其它的工业，也不是办不了的。大家认为公社党委的决定，不是“瞎胡闹”，而是可以实现的，而且还能办许多其它的工业。这时党的威信在群众中更高了，人们说：相信党，跟着党走，没有错。公社党的组织也从这里进一步的体验到毛主席的指示，发动群众，依靠群众，不断地与右倾保守思想作斗争，经常的掌握群众思想动态，发挥群众的智慧和干劲，没有完不成的革命事业。
    在群众发动起来以后，大办工业的热潮，风起云涌的卷遍了全社六十二个村屯炼钢、炼铁、炼焦、开矿，从制造农具，到生活用具等小五金生产，从土化肥到农药，以及做衣、制鞋、做酱菜、酿酒、熟皮革、烧砖、烧瓦、修理钟表等等，共达三十多种行业，由公社直接办的中小型厂、矿达五十四个，从业人员达一千一百零一人，各生产队（共三十个队）也都办起一至三个厂子，共一百多个。没有技术人员，就在各队里调查和动员退休的老工人，请他们出来做师傅，没有机器就收买废品修理、配件、改装。没有床子就用水槽子当底座，没有厂房，社员们就自动的搬出来，借给社里办工厂。大家越干劲越大。当时，走到那个村子，都会看到许多小学生收拣废铁，挖废铁。各个村屯沸腾起来了，有钱的出钱，有木材的献木材，有钢铁的献钢铁，有砖瓦的献砖瓦，大家一心为公社建工厂。当时搜集起的破铜乱铁一百二十多吨，现金和物资十万多元，解决了资金和原材料的困难。那时，走到山上去，便看到满山遍野的人群寻矿、开矿、挖莹石、挖云母；有一个退休的老工人张树成主动的找社党委，他说他知道那个山上有莹石矿源，如社里决定开采，他愿意领去开采，社里当时即拨给他二十人，由他领导，现在发展到一百多人的采矿队，去年全社采矿达八千多吨，支援了国家工业建设。各种各样的工厂建立起来了，公社所在地的蘆屯小镇从此改变了冷冷清清的面貌，过去从来不参加生产的男男女女，也都卷到大办工业的浪潮里来，当时几乎每天看到街上锣鼓喧天的工人报捷队伍，他们欢天喜地的把新产品献给党。
    在社办工业发展起来以后，又在某些厂矿干部中出现了贪大贪洋和片面追求盈利的倾向，如蘆屯镇的农业机械厂，有了四、五台机床，就想扩大为大工厂，要求大建厂房，安装新机器，不愿给农业生产农具，想给大工业加工；又看到洋井头利润大，便盲目的制造井头，造成大量的积压；双台子生产队看到开矿利润高，就偷偷的把农业机械厂的工人抽出来上山开矿，只留下两个挂马掌的工人，几乎陷于停顿状态。公社党委根据这种情况，进行了思想教育，明确公社工业必须同农业生产密切结合，首先为“发展农业和实现农业机械化、电气化服务，同时为满足社员日常生活需要服务”，在人力资源等条件许可的情况下，根据“因地制宜，就地取材”的原则，为国家的大工业和社会主义的市场服务，公社党委坚决贯彻了这个方针，在1959年2月到4月，对各厂矿进行了整顿工作，把多余的非直接参加生产的人员精简下来，转到农业战线上，做到开业的工业直接为农业服务，一般工业在农忙时务农，农闲时做工，亦农亦工，互相结合，使社办工业走上一个正确地发展道路。经过整顿之后，方向明确了，职工干劲更足了，根据需要，用自己的力量建厂扩厂，各厂的设备配套能够自己生产的，就尽量自己制造，没有技术人员，就自己培养训练，他们除了用师傅带徒弟的办法以外，并送徒工到国营大工厂去学习，自己还办了一个技术夜校，由老工人讲授，每天都有四五十名青年参加学习，技术水平在不断地提高，逐步掌握了机器的性能，用蚂蚁啃骨头的先进经验，试制出许多新产品，现在他们已经能够制造而且制造出来的有：简易车床、电动机、水泵、柴油机油咀、搅米机、粉碎机、各种犁、铧、锹、镐、播种机、插秧机、锄草机、拖拉机、割草机、锄草机、捆箱机、打井机、大小车辆等等。1959年他们制造出十四台车床，装备了各队的工厂和制造小农具十二万件，改良农具五万件，新式农具八千七百件，大车一百二十五台，水利工具两千四百八十件，土化肥土农药四千多吨，供应了农业生产上的需要。在生活日用品方面，他们生产了缸、盆、锅、刀、勺、布鞋、皮鞋、衣服（机制衣九万八千件，平均每人一点七件）箱、柜、水桶、筐篮等等；在建筑器材方面，生产了砖、瓦、合页、插销、扣手、螺丝钉等等，在副食品方面，生产了粉条、酱菜、果酒等等。1959年总产值四百六十万元，加上各队工业产值共达八百五十四万元。由于社办工业以为农业服务为主，在农具方面，节省劳动力二十二万五千个工日、畜力三万个工日、并改善了人民生活，增加了公社积累，1959年仅工业积累就达五十一万九千元，给农业买了三台拖拉机、三台汽车，并在双台子村建立一处发电站，除了工业用电外，三百户社员得到照明。广大社员极为满意，公社工业受到群众的大力支持。
    1960年芦屯人民公社在全国继续大跃进和大闹技术革命的鼓舞下，社办工业也有了飞跃的发展，他们和全国各地工业一样，用开门红迎接伟大的六十年代的第一年。盖平县人民委员会给芦屯公社工业指标，今年任务一千万元（不包括队营工业）但他们第一季度即完成九百二十七万元（不包括队营工业）。职工们的干劲，越干越高，技术革新层出不穷，在跨进1960年的时候，他们就提出来：“增产不增人”的响亮口号，在全社范围内迅速地掀起了人人动脑动手，人人出谋献策的以技术革命为中心的生产竞赛高潮。真是你追我赶，个个要当发明家，各个车间都组织了革新小组，搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，自动连接线等等。他们在两个多月中提出五百多条建议，实现了六十三项革新，职工们越研究越有兴趣，每个人都像着了迷一样的钻到发明创造里，有些工人以厂为家，昼夜埋头在车间里，不知疲倦，忘了吃饭。遇到实在解决不了的困难，就出去求师访友。各车间之间也掀起了共产主义友谊协作，为了创造一种新的工具而共同努力。经过两个多月的努力，木器厂已经完全机械化了，锯木、打眼、刨板、倒铆都不用人工了；机械厂的打锤、鼓风、搅铁等也机械化了，皮带车床取消了皮带，车床上安上了小电滚，实现了半自动化；粮米加工已经实现了自动化，自己连续作业，再不用人在中间一遍遍的倒米了。由于技术的不断革新，提高了工效，节约大量的劳动力，从事工业的扩大再生产。在第一季度为水利和春耕播种，他们除了检修全部农机具外，并且制造出农用工具（包括新式农具）一万二千四百六十多件，全公社机械化、半机械化程度已达50％以上。该社李屯生产队的食堂和养猪等后勤部门已经全部实现了半机械化和机械化。一般机械农具修配作到了小修不出队，大中型机具修配不出社，这就为促进农业四化，解放笨重的体力劳动开辟了道路。他们计划全年再制造粉碎机、搅米机等一千一百四十台，电动机、柴油机、车床、水泵等二百二十二台，4月份要制成十五台土拖拉机（柴油机接腿）以及各种改良农具，全年约计可为农业节省劳动力四十四万个工日，畜力六万个工日，并使全体社员都吃机制米。其它化肥农药也在大量生产。在服装方面，计划今年做十一万多件（不包括队营被服厂），采用天津市节约用布的经验，既节省农村妇女的时间，又可集中节约用布；其它生产皮鞋布鞋一万双，豆油八百吨，缸盆四千套，以及酱菜、淀粉、罐头等，供应生活必需；红砖二千多万块，供应建筑需要；莹石十三万三千吨，支援国家工业；再有五金杂货等等，为公社的生产和生活服务。工业总产值社计划四千万元（县给社的指标一千万元）第一季度已经完成了九百二十七万元（不包括队营），全体职工都满怀信心的认为：在党的总路线的照耀下，大鼓干劲是能够实现这个任务的。为了实现计划，职工们正在满怀热情地不断地进行技术革新，目前正在研究缝纫机的自动化（不用脚蹬），砖窑的鼓风和制坯机械化，做鞋机械化等等，预计4月上旬报捷。
    农村人民公社大办工业，加快了农业机械化、半机械化的进程，从而使人们感到农业生产也并不是那末苦的事情了，过去不安于农村生活的人现在感到农村生活有兴趣了，有些青年姑娘过去往城里跑，现在也安心下来，觉得农村生活越过越美，做衣、做鞋、做饭也能由机器代替，从此脱离了中台、锅台、磨台、炕台等四台的苦恼，而登上了英雄台、比武台、跃进台、文化台等四台的光荣。农民不仅能种地，也学会开机器，不仅学到农业技术，还学到了工业技术。农村人民公社各个生产部门实现机械化、半机械化，电气化后，大大地提高了劳动生产率，这就为精耕细作，提高单位面积产量创造了条件，为支援国家工业建设，向国营大工业输送劳动力创造了条件，这个社的粮食单位产量，1959年比1958年提高了30％，其它作物都有不同程度的增长。在劳动力方面，公社化后向大工业输送了三千多人。各个村屯由于工业的发展，农村经济生活繁荣起来了，随之而来的文化生活也繁荣起来了；工厂、商店、学校、电话、广播、邮电、储蓄所、医务所等等普遍建立起来了。社员们歌颂着：
    人民公社放光芒，祖国大地变了样；田野跑起拖拉机，村里机器在歌唱；磨米做衣不用手，种地锄草省力量；日落黄昏回家转，食堂菜饭甜又香；躺在炕上听广播，读书看报乐洋洋；人人敬爱毛主席，感恩不尽共产党。
    真是，过去偏僻的乡村，贫雇农世世代代愁眉苦脸，心头笼罩着一片阴云；而如今，则是心情愉快，他们说：毛主席像太阳一样照亮了每个人的心窝。蓝旗村有一个六十多岁的郭姓老人说：我做梦也想不到会过这样幸福生活，不用说吃的穿的好，想跟在外地工作的亲人们说话，也不要走出村子就能说话了（村里有电话），亲人们寄钱来邮递员直接送到手里，买东西也不用出村，又有了自己的工厂，不是共产党，谁能给劳动人民做这些好事呢？没有总路线、大跃进、人民公社，农民那能办工厂呢！社办工业才一年多，就已放出光芒来。当去年他们在广播上听到有右倾机会主义分子污蔑大跃进和人民公社的消息，有人就跳起来嚷道：“姓右的，你别闭着眼睛胡说八道，到我们社来看看，不是大跃进农民能办工厂，不是人民公社我们有这样大好光景？”
    我在这里只讲这一个社办工业的例子，他们是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，发动群众，自力更生，白手起家办起来的，像这样的公社当然不止这一个，由于党的省、市委对社办工业的重视，尤其最近两个月，省市委动员各国营企业支援农业，社办工业的发展是非常迅速的，农村面貌在起着急剧的变化。
    但是，社办工业还仅仅是个开始，我们的工作中还有许多缺点，譬如对企业的经营管理还缺乏经验，还要继续努力学习毛泽东思想，继续加强党的领导，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝，大搞技术革新和技术革命，认真贯彻执行党对社办工业的方针政策，把社办工业推向一个新的高潮，为加速实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化而奋斗。
