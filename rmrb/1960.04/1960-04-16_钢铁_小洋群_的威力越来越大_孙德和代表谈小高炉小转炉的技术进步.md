Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, we will surely be able to victoriously overfulfill this plan.

    As a worker engaged in the design of ferrous metallurgy, I would like to talk about my experiences regarding the great achievements created by China's steel "small foreign groups" in the Great Leap Forward, the source of their strong vitality, and their even greater prospects in the future, as we have come into contact with them.

    The achievements of China's steel "small foreign groups," like the achievements on other fronts, are the product of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the great victory of the policy of walking on two legs, launching mass movements in a big way, and Mao Zedong Thought on the steel front. Because the vast number of workers on the steel front resolutely implemented the Party's policies and followed Chairman Mao's teachings, two emerging new forces with strong vitality have emerged on the steel front. These are China's small blast furnaces and small converters, which are spread all over the country. Since 1958, small blast furnaces and small converters have made great contributions to the high-speed increase of steel production in our country. They have formed a vanguard force for continuous technological innovation and revolution on the metallurgical front. In the total steel production in 1959, small blast furnaces undertook more than half of the pig iron task, and converters produced about one-third or more of the steel. Only through the path of small foreign groups can the people of the whole country participate in the work of increasing steel production and accomplish such a huge task. Whether viewed from the percentage of steel growth or from the absolute amount, it is an astonishing creation and development unprecedented in history, both at home and abroad, and never dared to be imagined by anyone.

    The vigorous mass movement of thousands of horses galloping on the steel front is precisely a concentrated manifestation of the people's ardent desire to get rid of the backward state of being "unarmed." On this basis, in less than a year, a situation of small foreign groups springing up all over the place and scattered like stars has been formed. Among them are also a considerable number of medium-sized foreign groups. This has completely changed the unbalanced situation in our country in the past, where only a few provinces and cities had the iron and steel industry.

    Although the conditions of the small foreign groups are relatively poor and the raw materials used are not as good as those of the large and medium-sized foreign groups, the masses have liberated their minds and dared to think and act. Because the small blast furnaces are emerging things, without burdens, they are both production furnaces and experimental furnaces at the same time. Encouraged by the Party, people boldly innovate, bravely create, and continuously revolutionize, and a series of innovation and revolution achievements have emerged in a short period of time. These are concentratedly manifested in the continuous increase in the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces and the rapid growth of converter production. The iron produced per cubic meter of furnace volume per day in small blast furnaces has increased sharply and exponentially, reaching very high figures. This is indeed a miracle. The quality of these irons meets the requirements. These irons meet the urgent needs of the vast rural areas for manufacturing simple mechanical equipment, water conservancy, transportation tools, local railways, machine tools, and others. It meets the needs of local steelmaking and also supplies large steel plants for steelmaking in open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces. High indicators of small blast furnaces are no longer individual but appear in large areas.

    Born at the same time as the small blast furnace is China's original alkaline small converter. It is just right for the small blast furnace, just right for matching, and is a newborn sister flower on the steel front. Like the small blast furnace, it has strong vitality and adaptability to raw materials. Through more than a year of creatively innovative techniques by the masses, the small converter has created a set of skills to deal with high sulfur. It can use the pig iron raw materials with relatively high sulfur content produced by small blast furnaces in the initial stage to smelt high-quality steel. These steels are not inferior to open-hearth steel. In addition, it can also smelt high-quality steel, low-alloy steel, etc., and has a wider range of uses. The vast number of workers on the converter have put forward the slogan of surpassing open-hearth furnaces and catching up with electric furnaces. How heroic is this slogan! It is fully justified to expect that this slogan will be realized soon.

    The imperialists satirize, attack, and slander our mass steelmaking movement. However, the fact for the past year is that we have increased production by more than 10 million tons of iron and more than 5 million tons of steel. Facts have given them a strong counterattack.

    It is through these small foreign groups that provinces, cities, and autonomous regions that did not produce steel in the past have quickly developed into units with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons, hundreds of thousands of tons, or even more than one million tons of iron and a corresponding amount of steel. Some cities that have never produced steel have jumped to become cities producing hundreds of thousands of tons of steel. In some remote areas, such as Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, there has also been high-speed development. Obviously, the reason why small foreign groups can achieve such brilliant achievements, leap forward at such a high speed, and create such miracles is the product of the General Line, and it is given by the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought.

    The rapid growth and expansion of small blast furnaces and small converters is not easy either. They were obtained through the hard work of the vast number of workers under the socialist system and under the Party's support and care. The small blast furnace and small converter itself has the major advantages of less investment, simple equipment, can be manufactured everywhere, and easy to get started. However, the equipment used by small foreign groups is, after all, relatively poor compared with large and medium-sized foreign groups. Operating conditions are also more difficult. In the initial stage, the vast majority of workers were transferred from the agricultural front and must learn to master the complex technology of blast furnaces. Because the grade of the ore is uneven, unlike the pre-treatment in large blast furnaces, the sulfur content of the coal is high, and the ash content of the coke is high, which adds more difficulties to the initial operation of the small blast furnace. In terms of management, the cooperation of all parties was not experienced in the initial stage and must be gradually accumulated. The power and water sources in various places are not very ideal. In addition, it is necessary to gradually overcome the difficulties in mastering the transportation of a large number of raw materials under the condition that transportation tools are still relatively lacking. Our increase in the amount of pig iron in the past year means that tens of millions of tons or more of raw materials must be put into the furnace, which also means that there are roughly hundreds of millions of tons or more of handling volume. What a large number this is. However, these difficulties have not completely scared the warriors on the small foreign group front. It is conceivable how they relied closely on the leadership of the Party with amazing perseverance and communist style, gave full play to the infinite wisdom of the masses, overcame this series of difficulties, quickly mastered the blast furnace operating technology, and created a variety of new advanced experiences. In this struggle, the Party's leading comrades personally took command, mobilized the masses, went deep into the masses, and stayed with the masses, sharing weal and woe, engaging in experimental fields, accompanying the furnace for meals, and accompanying the furnace for sleep, always adhering to the forefront. This is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid achievement of such achievements. Through a series of on-site meetings, timely exchange, summary, and promotion of advanced experiences in various places, the competition, performance, learning, comparison, catching up, and helping under the socialist system were carried forward, and any good experience was quickly fully promoted. Our country has matched advanced experience into a set, summarized twelve experiences in the operation of small blast furnaces, and promoted the rising of production indicators of small blast furnaces. For example, the daily production level of small blast furnaces in a certain special zone in a certain province has increased by more than four times in one year, and the average utilization coefficient per cubic meter of furnace volume throughout the year last year has increased exponentially, and some have increased many times. The coke ratio has been greatly reduced. The furnace with the best furnace life has been opened for fifteen months since it was opened, and it is expected that it can be opened for another one or two years. The qualified rate of pig iron reached about 95%. In one year, it became a special zone producing hundreds of thousands of tons of iron. Due to a series of technological innovations, the cost of pig iron has been greatly reduced. The cost of pig iron in many enterprises has dropped below the transfer price of large blast furnaces. These unprecedented records have made the small blast furnace famous and powerfully broken the outdated concept of blast furnace operation inherited from capitalism with facts, and created new theories and raised new theoretical questions in blast furnace operation. These creations were not thought out by scientists, engineering technicians, or university professors. Blast furnace operation has been around for hundreds of years. However, no one at home and abroad has ever created such a record. These amazing records were created by the liberated workers and peasants in actual production today. Isn't this a vivid illustration that politics is the soul of everything? What is more far-reaching is that these advanced experiences of small blast furnaces have powerfully promoted the operational innovation of large blast furnaces, and also pointed out new directions for future high-speed development of steel production. Taking steel as the key link, small blast furnaces have also driven a series of technical innovations and technical revolutions in mining, ore dressing, coal washing, coking, and tar recovery that serve blast furnaces in a combination of indigenous and foreign methods or indigenous methods. In the past period, these advanced experiences and equipment have been quickly formed into a set. They shone brightly together with the small blast furnace.

    Although the steel "small foreign groups" have already made great contributions to my country's socialist construction, they are, after all, young new things that have not been fully balanced in the development of various places. More efforts must be made to continuously revolutionize and make them more perfect. From the existing achievements and production practice of small blast furnaces and small converters, it can be fully proved that they have a wider future in China's steel industry. First, due to their inherent advantages and the objective needs of China's vast land, dispersed resources, large steel demand, and high-speed development, more small blast furnaces and small converters will appear in more newly built small enterprises. Second, converters have the conditions to occupy part of the open-hearth furnace position in some medium-sized and small-sized enterprises, and combine with electric furnaces to smelt high-quality steel and alloy steel in areas lacking power sources. With the development of the situation, there will be more technological innovations and technical revolutions in this regard. This will put forward new tasks for my country's metallurgical workers, requiring the creation of new processes and operating methods. Third, according to the newly created experience, converters are not difficult to control because of their small capacity. In addition, it has the ability to digest coarse grains (pig iron with different chemical compositions). It can be said that it is "small or large" and "suitable for all situations." On the basis of the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, it meets the needs of county or rural people's communes to run industries. It can be imagined that if a county or a commune has a small steel industry, it will greatly promote the industrialization of the commune and drive a series of related other undertakings (such as mining, coal mining, coking, non-ferrous metallurgy, refractory materials, ceramics, building materials, agricultural machinery, chemical industry, water conservancy, food processing, light industry, etc.) to provide them with a material basis, promote the new high-speed development of rural power and transportation, rapidly improve people's lives, and cultivate a large number of technical forces to improve scientific and technological levels and further industrialization for various places lay the foundation. This will be more conducive to promoting the industrialization, mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy of the communes, creating conditions for gradually transitioning to ownership by the whole people and transitioning to a communist society.

    At present, the comprehensive utilization of resources in small foreign groups in various places has not reached a sufficient level due to the current equipment conditions. Improvements through certain measures can be fully utilized. For example, by using the surplus gas and water slag of small blast furnaces, it is preliminarily estimated that about 4,000 tons of coal combustion heat can be used as gas fuel for every 10,000 tons of iron smelted, and there will also be approximately 6,000 to 8,000 tons of water slag (blast furnace slag) that can be used for local production of native cement, slag bricks, or other construction purposes. In places with high-phosphorus ore, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 tons of steel slag phosphate fertilizer can also be produced to support local agricultural needs. Tar can also be better recovered from small coke ovens for the development of the chemical industry. Fully utilizing these by-products can better comprehensively utilize resources and further reduce costs.

    In short, the benefits of small foreign groups and small indigenous groups are endless, and they are also full of treasures, which are in line with the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    We are fortunate to live in the great era illuminated by Chairman Mao's image like the sun. We live in an era where one day equals twenty years. We see the ever-changing achievements of the Great Leap Forward every day. In glorious labor, our mood is infinitely excited and happy. We will always follow the Party. Chairman Mao will always be the source of our happiness and strength. We have unlimited strength and confidence to work with the warriors on the steel front across the country to make unremitting efforts to overfulfill the glorious tasks of 1960 and strive for greater achievements in the future.

    All of my country's achievements are attributed to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and to the great Chairman Mao.

    钢铁“小洋群”的威力越来越大
    孙德和代表谈小高炉小转炉的技术进步主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并且拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。我坚信：在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，和全国人民共同努力下，一定能够胜利地超额完成这个计划。
    作为一个黑色冶金设计工作者，我想谈一谈就我们所接触到的关于我国钢铁小洋群在跃进中所创造的伟大的成就，它们的强大生命力的来源，以及今后更为巨大的前景我的一些体会。
    我国钢铁小洋群的成就与其它战线上的成就一样，是党的建设社会主义总路线的产物，是两条腿走路的方针与大搞群众运动和毛主席思想在钢铁战线上的伟大胜利。由于钢铁战线上广大职工坚决贯彻了党的方针，遵循了毛主席的教导，在钢铁战线上出现了两个新兴的有强大生命力的生力军，这就是我国遍布各地的小高炉与小转炉。1958年以来，小高炉与小转炉为我国高速度增产钢铁作出了巨大的贡献。它们形成了冶金战线上不断的技术革新与革命的一支尖兵。在1959年的钢铁总生产量里，小高炉承担了一半以上的生铁任务，转炉炼出了大约三分之一以上的钢。只有通过小洋群的道路，才能够使全国人民都能参加到增加钢铁生产的工作上去，才能完成这样巨大的任务。无论从钢铁增长的百分数上看；或是从绝对量上看，都是古今中外历史上所未曾有过、也从来不曾有人敢于设想的惊人创造发展。
    钢铁战线上轰轰烈烈的万马奔腾的群众运动，正是全国人民热烈要求摆脱“手无寸铁”的落后状况的集中表现。在这个基础上，在不到一年的时间里形成了遍地长出小洋群星罗棋布的局面。其中也有数量不少的中洋群。这就彻底改变了我国过去只有少数的几个省、市有钢铁工业的不均衡面貌。
    虽然小洋群的条件比较差，使用原料也不如大中洋群，但是由于群众解放了思想，敢想敢干，由于小高炉是新兴的事物，没有包袱，既是生产炉，也同时是试验炉。人们在党的鼓舞下大胆的革新，勇敢的创造，不断的革命，在短期内出现了一系列的革新与革命成就。这些集中表现为小高炉的利用系数连续的上升与转炉生产的迅速增长。小高炉每立方米炉容积每日生产的铁，急剧成倍的增长，达到很高的数字。这确实是奇迹。这些铁的质量是符合要求的。这些铁满足了广大农村制造简单机械设备，水利，运输工具，土铁路，机床及其它的迫切需要。满足了地方上炼钢的需要，也供给了大钢铁厂在平炉、转炉、电炉中炼钢的需要。小高炉高指标已不是个别的而是大面积出现的了。
    与小高炉同时出生的是我国独创的碱性小转炉。它正好与小高炉门当户对，正好配套，是钢铁战线上新生的姐妹花。它与小高炉一样，具有强大的生命力与对原料的适应性。通过一年多以来广大群众技术上创造性的革新，小转炉创造了一套对付高硫的本领。它能使用小高炉在初期时生产出一部分的含硫比较高的生铁原料，炼出质量优良的钢来。这些钢比平炉钢并不逊色。此外还能炼出优质钢，低合金钢等，有了更广泛的用途。转炉上的广大职工提出了赛平炉，赶电炉的口号。这个口号是何等的豪迈！完全有根据可以预计这一口号将很快得到实现。
    帝国主义者对我们的群众炼钢运动进行讽刺、攻击和污蔑。然而一年来的事实是：我们偏偏却增产了一千多万吨铁，五百多万吨钢。事实对他们作了有力的还击。
    就是通过这些小洋群使过去不生产钢铁的省、市、自治区很快的发展成为年产十几万吨、几十万吨、甚至一百多万吨铁与相应数量钢的单位。一些从来没有生产过钢的城市，一跃而为生产几十万吨钢的城市。在边远一些的地区如：青海、新疆、宁夏也都有高速度的发展。很显然小洋群之所以能够取得如此辉煌的成就，以这样的高速度飞跃前进，创造出这样的奇迹，是总路线的产物，是总路线与毛主席思想所赋予的。
    小高炉小转炉的迅速成长壮大也不是轻而易举的。它们是在社会主义制度下，在党的扶持与爱护下，通过广大职工艰苦奋斗得来的。小高炉小转炉本身具有投资少，设备简单，各地都能制造，易于上马的重大优点。但是小洋群所使用的设备与大中洋群相比究竟是比较差的。操作条件也是比较困难的。在刚开始的阶段里，广大职工中绝大多数是从农业战线上转来的，必须学习掌握高炉的复杂技术。由于矿石的品位不一，不像在大高炉上得到事先的处理，煤的含硫量较高，焦炭的灰分高都给小高炉的初期操作增加了更多的困难。在管理上各方面的配合初期也是没有经验的，必须逐渐累积。各地的电源水源也不是很理想的。另外在掌握大量原材料运输上，在运输工具还比较缺乏的情况下也是须要逐渐克服的。我们在去年中增加生铁的数量，这意味着须要有几千万吨以上的原料进炉，更意味着大致有上亿吨以上的搬运量。这是多么大的数字。然而这些困难完全没有吓倒小洋群战线上的战士。可以想像他们是以怎样惊人的毅力，怎样的共产主义的风格，紧紧的依靠党的领导，发挥了群众的无穷智慧，克服了这一系列的困难，迅速的掌握了高炉操作技术，并且创造了万紫千红的新的先进经验。在这一斗争中，党的领导同志亲自挂帅，发动群众，深入群众，与群众在一起，共甘苦，搞试验田，伴炉餐，伴炉眠，始终坚持在最前线。这是迅速取得如此成就的根本保证。通过一系列的现场会议，及时交流、总结、推广各地的先进经验，发扬了社会主义制度下的竞赛，表演，学、比、赶、帮，任何好的经验都很快就得到全面推广。我国将先进经验配成套，在小高炉操作上总结了十二条经验，促使小高炉的生产指标节节上升，例如某些省某个专区小高炉的日产水平在一年内提高了四倍多，去年全年平均利用系数每立米炉容积有了成倍的增加，有的提高到原来的很多倍。焦比大为降低。炉龄最好的炉子自开炉以来已经开了十五个月，预计还可以再开一、二年。生铁的合格率达到95％左右，一年内成为产铁几十万吨的一个专区。由于一系列的技术革新，生铁成本大幅度降低。不少企业的生铁成本已降到大高炉的调拨价格以下，这些空前的纪录使小高炉威名远扬，以事实有力的打破了人们从资本主义沿袭下来的对高炉操作的陈腐概念，并且在高炉操作上创造了新的理论，提出了新的理论问题。这些创造不是科学家，工程技术人员，也不是大学教授们想出来的。高炉操作已经有了几百年的历史。但古今中外还没有人创造过这样的纪录。这些惊人的纪录是今天解放了的工农群众在实际生产里创造出来的。这不是生动的说明了政治是一切事情的灵魂吗？更具有深远意义的是这些小高炉的先进经验有力的促进了大高炉的操作革新，也为今后的钢铁生产高速度的发展指出了新的努力方向。以钢为纲，小高炉还带动了周围的其他一系列为高炉服务的土洋结合的或是土生土长的采矿，选矿，洗煤，炼焦，焦油回收的技术革新与技术革命。在过去的一段时间里迅速形成了这些先进经验与设备配套。它们与小高炉共同放出了光彩。
    钢铁小洋群虽然已经为我国社会主义建设立下了汗马功劳，但是它们毕竟还是年轻的出生不久的新事物在各地的发展上还不是完全平衡的。还须要作更多的努力不断革命使它们更为完善。从小高炉与小转炉现有的成就与生产实践已经完全可以证实在我国钢铁工业上，它还有更为广大的前途。第一，它们将由于本身所具备的优越性与我国地大、资源分散，钢铁需要量大，以及高速度发展的客观需要在更多的新建的小型企业里出现更多的小高炉与小转炉。第二，转炉有条件在一些中型及中小型的企业里占据一部分平炉的阵地，并且结合电炉为缺少电源的地区冶炼优质钢，合金钢。随着形势的发展在这方面还会有更多的技术革新与技术革命。这将对我国的冶金工作者提出新的任务，要求创造新的工艺与操作方法。第三，根据目前已经新创造的经验，转炉并不因为容量太小而难于控制。另外加上它有能消化粗粮的本领（化学成分不同的生铁），可以说它是“小大由之”，“无往不宜”，在土洋结合的基础上，它是符合于县或农村人民公社办工业的需要的。可以设想一个县或是一个公社如果有了小的钢铁工业便会对公社工业化起巨大的推动作用，并且带动一系列有关的其它事业（例如采矿，采煤，炼焦，有色冶金，耐火材料，陶瓷，建筑材料，农业机械，化工，水利，食品加工，轻工业等）为它们提供物质基础，促进农村动力与交通运输新的高速度发展，为人民生活迅速提高，并为各地大量培养技术力量提高科学技术水平与进一步工业化打下基础。这将会更有利于促进公社工业化，农业机械化，电气化，水利化，为逐步向全民所有制过渡与向共产主义社会过渡创造条件。
    目前各地小洋群在资源综合利用方面，因为限于当前的设备条件，还没有达到充分利用的程度。通过一定的措施加以改善就可以得到充分利用，例如：利用小高炉富裕的煤气与水渣，初步估算每炼一万吨铁约有四千吨煤的燃烧热量可以作为气体燃料使用，还将有大致六千到八千吨的水渣（高炉渣）可以供各地方制造土水泥、渣砖或其它建筑用途。在有高磷矿的地方，还可以生产大致一千五到二千吨的钢渣磷肥支援地方农业的需要。小焦炉上还可以更好的回收焦油供化学工业的发展。充分利用了这些副产，便能更好的综合利用资源，并能进一步降低成本。
    总之小洋群、小土群的好处是说不完的，它身上也是有百宝，是符合于多快好省的方针的。
    我们幸运的生活在毛主席的像太阳照耀着的伟大时代，我们生活在一天等于二十年的时代，我们每天看到日新月异的大跃进成就。在光荣的劳动里，我们的心情是无限的兴奋愉快。我们永远跟着党走，毛主席永远是我们幸福与力量的源泉，我们有无限的力量与信心与全国的钢铁战线上的战士一起，进行不懈的努力，为超额完成1960年的光荣任务及今后更大的成就而奋斗。
    我国一切成就归功于光荣的中国共产党，归功于伟大的毛主席。
