	Learning from Zhang Shizhen
	Lao She

	Some time ago, I wrote a short piece of 快板 [clapper talk] for the Beijing "Dagong Bao," praising Zhang Shizhen, a red banner on the commercial front. At that time, the "Zhang Shizhen" play, written by the Tianjin Pingju Theatre, had already been premiered. I really wanted to see this play, but I didn't have time to go to Tianjin. I'm so happy that this play came to Beijing! I rushed to see it!

	After seeing the play, I gained a lot of inspiration, which I will briefly describe below:

	New people and new things must be performed using new methods. Yes, this play was not arranged according to the old conventions of Pingju. In some places, it resembles a spoken drama, and in other places, it resembles a new opera. I think it should be done this way. Otherwise, if the characters all move in square steps and follow the rhythm of gongs and drums, with you entering and me exiting, it will be difficult to express the spirit of the soaring enthusiasm of the new era. If the characters leisurely show off their sleeves and then touch their temples when they appear, it will probably be difficult to align with the Great Leap Forward. People of the Leap Forward era must express the momentum of the Leap Forward in their gestures and actions. This play has made a prominent effort in this regard, and it does indeed show a new social atmosphere. It is a new form that has emerged to meet the needs of the new society. Some details may not be perfectly arranged, but its bold attempt to discard the old and establish the new is undeniable. There has been much discussion about whether spoken dramas depicting historical figures need to use the traditional performance techniques of opera, so I won't go into it further here; as for operas with modern themes, I think we should carefully use some of the performance methods of spoken dramas and new operas.

	Of course, in this attempt to bring forth the new from the old, it is inevitable that some places are neither completely new nor completely old, appearing somewhat confused. For example, although the characters no longer walk in dance steps, their hand gestures are still the old set. There is such a situation in "Zhang Shizhen." However, I don't think this is a particularly big shortcoming. By intensifying our learning from the working people, we can slowly figure out a new set of hand gestures and movements to match modern themes. On the other hand, at present, as long as we rehearse rigorously, carefully selecting and arranging every movement and gesture, I think those traditional techniques are still very useful. The problem is that there must be strict requirements for raising hands and feet, and nothing should be done casually. If you are casual, it will be chaotic.

	The singing and music in "Zhang Shizhen" have also been reformed and enriched. This is gratifying! I really like the chorus parts, which neither overshadow the main performers nor weaken the momentum. I suggest: why not be even bolder and try using two-part or three-part harmonies in those places that are close to backing vocals, to make the momentum even stronger! I think the singing of some local operas is indeed a bit monotonous and should be enriched urgently. As for the chorus parts, some operas have none at all, and others are too weak. They should be appropriately increased and strengthened. The voice of the people of New China should be loud and clear.

	In terms of content, this is a play that we need today. In the play, Yang Xiujuan repeatedly asks Zhang Shizhen angrily: Why do you have to take care of so many things? Yes, the point is in this sentence. People with communist ideas think of others everywhere, are full of vigor, and sacrifice themselves for others. People without communist ideas draw circles everywhere, fearing to cross the line and get into trouble without gaining anything. Today, as we are vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and vigorously establishing urban people's communes, we must all learn from Comrade Zhang Shizhen! Our work is different, but our style must be the same as that of Comrade Zhang Shizhen.

	This is a good play. I hope that during the re-processing, if the characters can be made more prominent and the story more focused, this play will surely be even more moving.

专栏：现代题材戏曲观摩演出评价

    向张士珍学习
    老舍
    前些日子，我给北京“大公报”写过一小段快板，歌颂商业战线上的一面红旗张士珍。那时候，天津市评剧院编写的“张士珍”已经公演。很想看看这出戏，可是没工夫到天津去。真高兴，这出戏来到了北京！赶快去看！
    看了戏，得到不少启发，略述如下：
    新人新事就得用新方法表演。是的，这出戏没按着评剧的老套子去安排。它有的地方像话剧，也有的地方像新歌剧。我觉得应当这么办。要不然，人物都迈着方步、踩着锣鼓点儿，你出来，我进去，就很难表现新时代干劲冲天的精神。人物出场若是慢条斯理地先耍袖子，后摸鬓角，大概就很难与大跃进对上口径。跃进时代的人，抬手动脚要表达出跃进的劲头。这出戏在这一方面作得很突出，的确使人看到了新的社会气象。它是适应新的社会需要而产生的新形式。在某些细节上也许安排得未能尽善尽美，可是它的大胆尝试，破旧立新，是无可反对的。描写历史人物的话剧需要不需要运用戏曲的传统表演技法，讨论已多，即不在此多讲；至于现代题材的戏曲，恐怕就该精心运用一些话剧与新歌剧的表演方法了。
    当然，在这推陈出新的尝试中，免不了这里或那里还既不全新，又不全旧，显着有点混乱。比如说：人物虽不再走舞步，可是手式还是那旧一套。“张士珍”里就有这种情形。可是，我看这并不是什么特大的缺点。加紧向劳动人民学习，我们就可以慢慢琢磨出一套新手式新身段，配合现代题材。另一方面，在目前，只要严格地排演，每一身段与手式都精选细排，一丝不苟，我看那些传统的技巧还是很有用处的。问题在于抬手动脚须有严格的要求，一点不随便。一随便，就会乱。
    “张士珍”里的唱腔与音乐也都有所改革与丰富。这是可喜的事！我很喜爱那些合唱部分，既未喧宾夺主，又振起了声势。我建议：爽性就再大胆一些，在那些近乎帮腔的地方试用二部或三部合唱，叫声势更壮！我觉得某些地方戏曲的唱腔确是有些单调，应该急图丰富，至于合唱部分呢，有的戏里根本没有，有的又嫌薄弱，似应适当增加与加强。新中国人民的声音应当是响亮的。
    由内容上说，这是我们今天所需要的一出戏。剧中的杨秀娟一再含怒质问张士珍：为什么要管那么多的事呢？是的，文章就在这一句里。有共产主义思想的人，处处为别人着想，意气风发，舍己为人。没有共产主义思想的人，到处画个圈儿，唯恐越界出线，受累不讨好。在大搞增产节约运动、大办城市人民公社的今天，我们都须向张士珍同志学习！我们的工作各有不同，我们的作风可都须跟张士珍同志的一个样。
    这是一出好戏。我希望在再加工的时候，若能使人物性格更为突出，故事更加集中，这出戏就必能更感动人了。
