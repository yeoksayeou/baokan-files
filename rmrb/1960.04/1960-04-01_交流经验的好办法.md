Good Ways to Exchange Experiences

    In the surging tide of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, new creations and new experiences are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. These are all valuable assets in production and science and technology. But to make them play their full role and use them to rapidly improve the production level of the entire society, it is necessary to do a good job of experience exchange in a timely manner. Especially in the process of marching towards "high, large, precise, advanced, and new" and climbing the peaks of science and technology, on the one hand, we must rely on our own hard work and creation, and on the other hand, we must absorb the experience of others and "borrow a ladder to climb upstairs." If the work of exchanging experience is not done well, such situations may occur: some problems have already been solved by advanced units, but other units are still re-exploring and experimenting from scratch; the experience created by Unit A in this area is learned by Unit B from other places... This is a waste of manpower and material resources.
    How to exchange experiences? There can be many ways. Various methods have been widely adopted in various places, such as on-site meetings, technical performance competitions, and exhibitions. Now, Liaoning has provided another good experience, that is, the universal establishment of a science and technology information network. This approach not only absorbs the strengths of the above-mentioned methods, but also further regularizes the work of exchanging experiences and exchanging scientific and technical information, and is based on a broader mass base. Therefore, the sources of information are wide, the exchange of experience is fast, and it effectively promotes the technical innovation movement and the development of production. Promoting this experience can quickly make innovation and creation "bring in the harvest," spread widely, and blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

### 交流经验的好办法

    交流经验的好办法
    在风起云涌的技术革新和技术革命运动中，新创造新经验犹如雨后春笋。这都是生产和科学技术方面的宝贵财富。但要使它们充分发挥作用，利用它们来迅速提高整个社会的生产水平，这就需要及时作好经验交流工作。特别是在向“高大精尖新”进军，攀登科学技术高峰的过程中，一方面要靠自己刻苦钻研创造，一方面也要吸取别人的经验，“借梯上楼”。如果交流经验的工作做得不好，还会出现这样的情况：有些问题，先进单位早已解决了，别的单位还在重新摸索，从头试验；本地区甲单位创造的经验，乙单位反而跑到外地去学习……这在人力、物力等方面都是浪费。
    怎样交流经验呢？方式可以多种多样。各地已经广泛采用的有现场会、技术表演赛、展览会，等等。现在，辽宁又提供了一项好经验，这就是普遍建立科学技术情报网。这种作法既吸收了上述各种作法的长处，又使交流经验、互通科学、技术情报的工作进一步经常化，并且建立在更广泛的群众基础上。因此，情报来源广，经验交流快，有效地促进了技术革新运动和生产的发展。推广这一经验，可迅速地使革新创造“颗粒归仓”，广泛传播，遍地开花结果。
