	True Intentions and Absurd Talk
	Not long ago, French President de Gaulle personally exposed his so-called trick of recognizing the self-determination of the Algerian people. However, French Prime Minister Debré felt it necessary to repeat it once more, and to make it even clearer. He delivered a broadcast speech in Algeria on the 12th, stating that "France may call on people to exercise self-determination peacefully, and this is its honor." But Debré immediately proved to the people that this "honor" of France was not worth half a penny.
	Few people would doubt what kind of choice the Algerian people would make if they were truly allowed to exercise self-determination. The Algerian people have persisted in their tenacious struggle for more than five years. Is this not enough to show their will to demand independence? How would the French government treat the results of such self-determination? The French Prime Minister answered such a question: "What will happen in the unbelievable and unfortunate event that the majority of Algerians finally choose separation (i.e., independence)?" He said: "People cannot and will not be able to revoke the French citizenship of those Algerians who are willing to live freely in Algeria as French people." To put it simply: "No matter what choice you make, Algerians can only be French citizens anyway." He also categorically stated: "Separation is actually division," and this is incompatible with France's "sacred principles." What are France's "sacred principles"? Debré did not hide it: This is that "there is no such thing as France giving up Algeria now, nor will there be in the future." So-called recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination turns out to be this. The Algerian people can only choose between Algeria belonging to France forever or France occupying Algeria forever!
	Debré also publicly announced: In order to keep Algeria with France, the French government "will continue to carry out pacification work." This means that the French authorities are determined to continue armed suppression in an attempt to realize the delusion that can never be realized: to make the Algerian people submit.
	The French colonialists' "great ambition" is not limited to Algeria alone. Debré announced his "ambition," saying that the fate France arranged for Algeria "should be an example for its neighboring and distant neighbors where racism still exists." That is to say: there is no such thing as France giving up its colonies in Africa now, nor will there be in the future.
	Of course, no one can stop the French Prime Minister from harboring all kinds of "ambitions," but unfortunately, things are not as smooth as he hoped. The whole of Africa is boiling, and the resolute struggle of the Algerian people has indeed set an example for other African people, making them understand that only by waging an unyielding struggle against the colonialists can they achieve true independence. All colonialists will eventually have to get out of the land of Africa, and the French colonialists are naturally no exception.

    真主意和荒唐话
    不久以前，法国总统戴高乐曾经亲自把他的所谓承认阿尔及利亚人民自决的把戏拆穿了，但是法国总理德勃雷却认为有必要再重复一次，而且把话说得更明确些。他12日在阿尔及利亚发表了一次广播演说，表示“法国可能号召人们心平气和实行自决，这是它的荣誉”。而德勃雷马上就向人们证明，法国的这一“荣誉”是不值半文钱的。
    很少人会怀疑，如果真正让阿尔及利亚人民自决，他们会作出什么样的抉择。阿尔及利亚人民已经坚持了五年多的顽强斗争，难道还不足以表明他们要求独立的意志吗？法国政府准备怎样对待这样的自决的结果呢？这位法国总理回答了这样一个问题：“万一发生难以置信和不幸的情况，即是说阿尔及利亚大多数人终于选择了分裂（按即独立），那将发生什么事情呢？”他说：“人们现在不能、将来也不能取消那些愿意作为法国人而愿意自由地在阿尔及利亚生活的阿尔及利亚人的法国公民资格”。说得明白易懂一点就是：“不管你作什么样的选择，阿尔及利亚人反正只能是法国的公民”。他还斩钉截铁地说：“分裂实际上就是分割”，而这是与法国的“神圣原则”不相容的。法国的“神圣原则”是什么呢？德勃雷毫不隐讳：这就是“现在没有、将来也不会有法国放弃阿尔及利亚的事情”。所谓承认阿尔及利亚人民自决权也者，原来如此。阿尔及利亚人民只能在阿尔及利亚永远属于法国或者法国永远占据阿尔及利亚这二者之间选择其一！
    德勃雷还公开宣布：为了使阿尔及利亚仍将同法国在一起，法国政府“将继续进行绥靖工作”。这就是说，法国当局决心继续进行武力镇压，以图实现永远无法实现的妄想：使阿尔及利亚人民屈膝。
    法国殖民主义者的“大志”还不仅在于阿尔及利亚一地而已。德勃雷宣布他的“雄心”说：法国给阿尔及利亚安排的这种命运“应当成为它毗邻的和遥远的、还存在着种族主义的邻国的榜样。”那就是说：现在没有、将来也不会有法国放弃它在非洲的殖民地的事情。
    当然谁也无法阻止法国总理怀有各种各样的“雄心”，可惜事情并不像他所希望的那样如意。整个非洲都在沸腾了，而且阿尔及利亚人民的坚决斗争的确给其他的非洲人民树立了榜样，使他们明白：只有同殖民主义者进行不屈的斗争才能获得真正的独立。一切殖民主义者终将要从非洲的土地滚出去，而法国殖民者自然也不例外。
