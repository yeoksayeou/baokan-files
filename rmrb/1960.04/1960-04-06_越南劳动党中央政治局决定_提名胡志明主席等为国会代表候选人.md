Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 5th: The Central Politburo of the Vietnam Workers' Party has decided to nominate some party leaders as candidates for deputies to the Second National Assembly. The election for the Second National Assembly of Vietnam will be held on May 8th.

According to the demands of the people of Hanoi and the suggestion of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party, the Politburo decided to invite Chairman Ho Chi Minh to be a candidate for National Assembly deputy in the first electoral unit of Hanoi (Ba Dinh District).

After this news spread, more than 15,000 residents of Ba Dinh District, Hanoi, held a grand rally on the afternoon of the 2nd to warmly welcome Chairman Ho as a candidate for National Assembly deputy in the district.

The Law on the Election of National Assembly Deputies of Vietnam stipulates that in each electoral unit, political parties and people's organizations can nominate candidates separately or jointly. Individuals also have the right to nominate themselves for election.

The Central Politburo of the Workers' Party also decided to nominate Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and 19 other central committee members as candidates for National Assembly deputies in Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh, and other places. In addition, Pham Van Dong, Ton Duc Thang, and seven other central committee members, who were elected as deputies to the First National Assembly by the people of South Vietnam in 1946, will have their terms of office extended.

The Eleventh Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly passed a resolution stating that because the Ngo Dinh Diem clique refused to hold national general elections, it was decided to extend the terms of the South Vietnamese deputies to the First National Assembly until a new resolution is made.
