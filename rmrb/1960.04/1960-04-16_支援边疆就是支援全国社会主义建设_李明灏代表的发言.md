Supporting the Frontier is Supporting National Socialist Construction
Speech by Delegate Li Minghao

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the draft 1960 state budget. These two reports fully demonstrate the ambitious aspirations of our 650 million people to accelerate socialist construction; vividly reflect the enormous vitality of the Party's general line for building socialism; and shine with the victorious brilliance of creative Marxism-Leninism – Mao Zedong Thought. It is entirely justified to believe that, through the transmission and implementation of this meeting, our vast number of workers, peasants, and intellectuals will be further encouraged to exert soaring efforts, continue to break down superstitions, liberate their minds, and propel the ongoing, magnificent production movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution to an even higher level, striving forward to victoriously realize the 1960 leap forward plan and accelerate the continued leap forward of socialist construction.

Some people say, "If you haven't been to the great Northwest of the motherland, you don't know the greatness of the motherland." This is absolutely true. "Seeing is believing." From October to December 1959, I accompanied the Hubei Province delegation for comforting the youth and middle-aged representatives supporting the socialist construction in the frontier, and conducted a comforting activity in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for about two months. During the comforting process, I visited the local people's communes and the state-owned farms of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. I not only saw the revolutionary heroism displayed by the outstanding sons and daughters from the interior who went to Xinjiang to participate in the cause of socialist development and construction, in which they started from scratch, overcame difficulties, and showed the optimism of not being afraid of difficulties and forging ahead. Moreover, I also saw the close unity of the thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang, mainly the Uygur people, working hand in hand, advancing in unison, establishing the motherland's rich grain and cotton base and creating a large number of industrial and mining enterprises on the vast wilderness and in the mineral-rich mountains. Seeing the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, under the shining light of the Party's ethnic policy, painting the newest and most beautiful pictures and writing the newest and best poems on this poorer and blanker piece of paper, made me engrave an unforgettable deep feeling for this rich land. Those heroic deeds inspired me to submit a motion to this conference with utmost excitement to vigorously support the socialist construction in the frontier.

Xinjiang is indeed a great and beautiful land of the motherland, rich in products, with favorable geographical conditions and harmonious human relations. The area is equivalent to two Northeast China, sixteen Jiangsu, and more than twice as large as France, the largest capitalist country in Europe. Xinjiang can also reclaim many more farmlands. With abundant water sources and long sunshine hours, once developed and constructed, it will be our country's best and largest cotton production base, as well as one of our country's important melon and fruit and animal husbandry bases. The crops there rely on river water and snow water irrigation, and do not "rely on the sky for food," so a bumper harvest can be guaranteed every year. The large grasslands there grow hundreds of economically valuable forages such as the world-famous fat sheep grass, which can breed countless herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. Especially after the realization of our country's grand plan of diverting water from the south to the north, introducing the water of the Yangtze River into Xinjiang, not only will the arable land increase, but even the large deserts such as Taklimakan can be turned into oases. This kind of myth that could only be considered a fantasy in the past will become a living reality in this great Mao Zedong era.

Xinjiang's mineral resources are even more abundant. The Karamay oil field is already famous throughout the country, and the coal reserves are also extremely astonishing, as well as iron ore and rare metal deposits. Xinjiang is indeed a treasure bowl. If these resources are developed and utilized and transferred to the track of modern large-scale production, it will be of great significance for accelerating our country's socialist industrialization and for prospering the frontier of the motherland.

As the saying goes, "Outstanding people come from outstanding lands." Over the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, especially under the shining light of the Party's general line and ethnic policy, the socialist construction cause in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, like the interior, has achieved amazing achievements, fundamentally changing the desolate scene before liberation. It is understood that before liberation, Xinjiang did not produce an inch of steel or a pound of pig iron, and only had fourteen small factories with outdated equipment. Now, more than 1,500 modern enterprises have been built, producing some steel and various machinery. If we add the small and medium-sized industries run by the county and people's communes, there are more than 18,000 industrial and mining enterprises in the entire region. The total grain output has increased by 2.4 times compared to before liberation, and the average income of the people has been equivalent to more than three times that of before liberation. The people of all ethnic groups in the entire region are happily singing and marching forward to accelerate socialist construction. From the depths of their hearts, resounding praises are overflowing: "The motherland is good, the Communist Party is good, Chairman Mao is good, socialism is good, and the people's commune is good!"

Among the countless heroic miracles in building socialist Xinjiang, there is a labor army that deserves great praise, and that is the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. This unit was once part of the People's Liberation Army with a long revolutionary history and countless battles. In 1952, under the leadership of General Wang Zhen, it exemplarily implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee to develop and build a new Xinjiang, collectively transferred to the agricultural front. After the transfer, in order to maintain the glorious title of the People's Liberation Army, implement the policy of combining labor and military affairs, and carry out land reclamation, they fully promoted the glorious tradition of the organization, discipline, and combat readiness of the People's Liberation Army on the production and construction front, and still retain the organizational form of the army to this day. During this comforting activity, I personally witnessed the great achievements created by the Agricultural 1st Division of the Corps for the prosperity of Xinjiang. After entering Xinjiang, before the sweat from their continuous battles had dried, they immediately picked up their hoes and invested in production and construction. They cut through thorns, built wasteland, and transitioned from simple "cutlass" to mechanized and semi-mechanized large-scale agricultural production. In order to solve the water conservancy problems of the Corps and the local fraternal ethnic groups, the constructed main and branch canals are more than 1,300 kilometers long. The entire division has 24 large-scale mechanized farms and 4 ranches, with a planting area of ​​970,000 acres. Cotton production reached 17 million catties, and grain reached 59 million catties. The development of various livestock has reached more than 214,000 heads. Since the Great Leap Forward, the development of industrial and sideline production has been even more encouraging. They established steel mills, power stations, fertilizer plants, machinery factories, tractor repair and parts factories, cement plants, etc. from scratch. Under the inspiration of the general line, through the hard work of all officers and soldiers of the Second and Third General Farms of the Agricultural 1st Division, in the Tarim Basin, in just one and a half years, two veritable "Happy Cities" were established. On the Gobi Desert, which has always been uninhabited, a milestone and lighthouse for the great march towards communism have been erected. The current Tarim is truly full of fertile land and lined with factories. Agricultural universities, agricultural technical schools, middle and primary schools, kindergartens, nurseries, Xinhua bookstores, theaters, factories, shops, etc. have been established there. Who would have thought that this was once a primeval forest and uninhabited? Here, I once again learned the truth of Marxism-Leninism that "the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces," and deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the victorious red flag for the rapid advancement of our country's socialist construction cause along the correct path.

Over the past ten years, in the labor of jointly developing and constructing the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the people of all ethnic groups, they have exemplarily implemented the Party's ethnic policy. They have sincerely cooperated with the local people, learned from each other, united and helped each other, especially in the achievements of agricultural mechanized cultivation and the promotion of advanced production technology, which has had a very profound impact on the local farmers and herdsmen. The large-scale cotton production in the Manas reclamation area has been abundant for years, which has opened up a new path for farmers of all ethnic groups to reform cotton planting technology. In addition to receiving thousands of farmers every year to visit and exchange experiences, from 1953 to 1957 alone, the Corps dispatched more than 2,500 cadres, dispersed to 25 counties in the autonomous region to help people of all ethnic groups establish 549 agricultural cooperatives, develop production, and train more than 100,000 technicians for various agricultural cooperatives. Every year during the busy farming season, the farms send a large number of tractors, combines, manpower, and animal power to help the agricultural cooperatives cultivate land, sow seeds, and harvest crops. In addition, they have also reclaimed more than 600,000 mu of wasteland for the masses free of charge, dredged more than 950 kilometers of large and small canals, built more than 1,300 houses, treated more than 390,000 people for diseases, and donated more than 42,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and more than 2.9 million catties of grain. The masses reflected, "The Production Corps is a good unit nurtured by Chairman Mao, thinking of us everywhere. The Corps are relatives that we will never forget in our hearts." The Production Corps has also received selfless support from the local people of all ethnic groups, and the masses regard the cause of the Corps as their own. For example, when the Agricultural 4th Division was smelting steel in 1958, the labor force was extremely tense. In Wenquan, there were more than 4,000 sheep that could not be brought back. The local people's commune automatically sent more than 30 people, riding horses over the rugged Tianshan Mountains, traveling back and forth for more than 30 days, to bring back the flock. The crops of the 10th Regiment could not be harvested in the fields, and the commune also sent a lot of labor to help with the rush to harvest, and no remuneration was required for these labors. Such deeds can be said to be too numerous to record. This close unity is the glorious result of the Corps' implementation of the Party's ethnic policy. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang use the relationship between fish and water, blood and flesh to describe their deep friendship.

The brilliant achievements created by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps over the past ten years are not only well-known to the local people of all ethnic groups, but also praised by all foreigners who have visited there. We know that President Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam and the delegation of the Korean People's Army have both been there. Comrade Zhu De also inspected it in 1958. Comrade Zhu praised the Corps as "the largest and best people's commune." This is the Party's evaluation and the greatest honor given to them.

On this solemn platform, the reason why I want to talk to all delegates about the situation of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is first, to express my unforgettable feelings for the past few months after the visit, and second, to
  Use the glorious deeds of the Xinjiang Production Corps in the past ten years to illustrate that the development and construction of the frontier is promising. Xinjiang has a vast land, rich products, and contains all kinds of rich resources. Industry and agriculture and animal husbandry have great development potential. It is a treasure land of the motherland. Although a lot of resources have been developed in the ten years since liberation, compared with the infinite treasures waiting to be developed in Xinjiang, it can be said that it is only the beginning. Although the economic and cultural construction of the Xinjiang region has made great leaps compared with the past, it has not yet completely eliminated the imbalance with the interior in economic and cultural development. If our country has not fundamentally changed the face of "poverty and blankness," then Xinjiang can be said to be in a poorer and blanker situation. The Xinjiang region has a sparse population, a weak technical foundation, and undeveloped transportation. In the process of accelerating socialist construction, on the one hand, it needs to rely on the people of all ethnic groups in the region, under the leadership of the Party, to rely on their own efforts, work hard, and advance victoriously. On the other hand, it also urgently needs the country and the fraternal provinces and regions in the interior to continue to give great support in terms of manpower, materials, and technology.

First, the lack of labor force is the biggest difficulty in the current development and construction of the Xinjiang region, and it is very necessary for the people of the interior, especially the Han people, to support the labor force. In the past ten years, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward, some inland provinces, under the unified leadership of the central government, proceeding from the overall point of view that "supporting the frontier is supporting the socialist construction of the whole country," have highly promoted the spirit of communist collaboration and transferred a large number of young and middle-aged people to develop and build the great northwest and other frontier areas of the motherland. This revolutionary move has far-reaching significance in politics, economy, and national defense construction. Now, all the young and middle-aged people who have gone to Xinjiang, under the meticulous care and help of the local party and government leaders and fraternal ethnic groups, actively participate in the industrial and agricultural production of the frontier areas according to the needs of local production. After labor practice, they quickly learned production technology, and many of them became tractor drivers and advanced producers, and their political consciousness of loving the motherland, loving the frontier, and fraternal ethnic groups has been greatly improved. The young and middle-aged people who support the construction of Xinjiang have reflected one after another that "the farm is better than home, and the party is better than parents," and are determined to settle down and start a career there for a long time, take root, blossom, and bear fruit. Agriculture is the foundation of our country's national economy. In order to accelerate the development of agricultural production, the central government has pointed out that on the one hand, we must continue to implement Chairman Mao's "eight-character constitution for agriculture" to increase the yield per unit area; on the other hand, we must actively reclaim wasteland and expand the area of ​​cultivated land. During the three five-year plans, our country plans to reclaim 400 million to 500 million mu of land. This is an extremely great and arduous task. The main fronts for reclaiming large areas of wasteland are in frontier areas such as Xinjiang and Qinghai. Therefore, mobilizing young and middle-aged people in the interior to develop and build the frontier is a long-term plan, which reflects the requirements of the rapid development of our country's national economy and is also the greatest interest of all ethnic groups in the country. Everyone knows that in our multi-ethnic unified socialist family, the speed of economic and cultural construction in various ethnic regions will have a great impact on the development of the entire country's socialist construction cause. At the same time, our goal is to establish a strong socialist economic system throughout the country and lay a solid material foundation for the transition to communism. Therefore, it is necessary to rationally allocate productive forces according to the law of proportional development of the national economy. One of the main principles of socialist productive force allocation is to make production as close as possible to raw material production areas, fuel and power resources, and product consumption areas, and to plan the distribution of labor. From this, it can be seen that mobilizing young and middle-aged people in the interior to go to the Xinjiang region to develop the rich resources there together with the local people of all ethnic groups is a strategic deployment to achieve a comprehensive allocation of productive forces and carry out socialist construction at high speed. Therefore, I deeply hope that all inland provinces can promptly transfer a batch of the best labor force to support the construction of the motherland's frontier as a glorious task. Implement political command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, vigorously promote collaboration, and mobilize a large number of young and middle-aged people to participate in the development and construction of the Xinjiang region as early as possible, so that Xinjiang and the interior can advance side by side, and build our great motherland into a beautiful big garden.

Second, inconvenient transportation is the second major difficulty in the development and construction of the Xinjiang region, and it needs strong support from the country. Everyone also knows that railways, highways, and air routes are the main arteries and blood vessels of the national economy. Over the past ten years, the transportation cause in various frontier areas has been
  Rapid development. At this conference, Vice Premier Li Fuchun also proposed a grand plan to rapidly develop railways, highways, and shipping. It is said that the Lanxin Railway will be open to traffic to Urumqi in the second quarter of this year, and the railway from Xining to Qaidam and other places is also being actively built, which is worthy of our applause and cheers. But I hope that the leaders of the railway transportation department and the vast number of workers and comrades can work harder, not only to complete this road of Sino-Soviet friendship as soon as possible, but also to quickly build the railway from Urumqi to Aksu and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang and then to Hotan, Yutian, and directly to Qinghai, and use the railway as the main line to build a spider web-like highway and carriage road. The construction of these transportation lines is extremely beneficial to the development of our country's national economy. Not to mention other things, wild hemp is everywhere in the Tarim, growing and dying on its own for generations, with a thickness of several feet. If it can be transported out in large quantities, it will become the best raw material for weaving high-end clothing. Yili is known as a granary, and the wheat, corn, etc. produced every year are piled up like mountains, but currently they cannot be transported out, and the mineral resources in various parts of Xinjiang are even more readily available and urgently need to be vigorously mined and transferred out. Therefore, building railways early and building highways extensively is the top priority for developing and constructing Xinjiang. It is said that the Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee already have a plan to vigorously develop the transportation industry. The reason why I raised this issue is to play the role of a "midwife." With the completion of the railway and the development of the transportation industry, the distance between the interior and the frontier will be shortened psychologically, and the close ties between the various ethnic groups will be further strengthened. By then, I hope that all delegates can go to the great northwest and to Xinjiang to conduct visits and see how the great rivers and mountains of the motherland and the hardworking and brave brothers of all ethnic groups are implementing the Party's general line and developing and building the great northwest.

Third, the weak technical foundation is the third difficulty in socialist construction in the frontier. As mentioned above, the industrial and agricultural production technology in the frontier areas was extremely backward before liberation. For example, Xinjiang in the past did not produce an inch of steel or a pound of pig iron. Agricultural production in some areas was still in the stage of horse racing and sowing, relying entirely on the sky for food, and there was no field management at all. Although industrial and agricultural production has made rapid progress in the ten years since liberation, and there have been many amazing innovations in production technology, because there is too much land and too few people, the production technology and production tools are still unable to keep up with the development of the situation. In the future, in accordance with the requirements of the socialist construction cause in the frontier ethnic areas, the production upsurge centered on technological innovation and technological revolution should also be carried out more vigorously in the Xinjiang region. This requires the country and the fraternal provinces and regions in the interior to provide more assistance in advanced technology. Such as modern mining, steelmaking, oil refining equipment, heavy machine tools, tractors, combines, and various improved agricultural tools, etc. Actually and effectively help the industrial and agricultural production in the frontier ethnic areas to continue to rise, and rapidly develop and utilize the rich resources of the Xinjiang region, and can also support the socialist construction of the whole country.

In short, the ethnic areas in the great northwest are the lovable and beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, with vast territory, rich resources, favorable geographical conditions, and harmonious human relations. The prospect of rapidly developing and building the frontier is very promising. The practice of the past ten years has proved that it is promising. Under the inspiration of the Party's general line for building socialism, the spiritual outlook of the fraternal ethnic groups in the frontier has undergone profound changes, and various production and construction causes have also shown a continuous leap-forward situation, rapidly changing the economic outlook of the frontier areas. Those who put Xinjiang and
  The people who associate "no thatch" to look at problems, the facts eloquently show that this is an outdated and completely inconsistent one-sided view. In the future, we also need to continue to hold high the red flag of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, based on the spirit of the whole country as a whole, and give greater support to socialist construction in Xinjiang from the manpower, material, and technical conditions, and strive together to build a prosperous and strong new Xinjiang at an early date.

The above speech, if there are any inappropriate places, please criticize and correct me.

### 支援边疆就是支援全国社会主义建设  李明灏代表的发言

专栏：

    支援边疆就是支援全国社会主义建设
    李明灏代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。这两个报告充分地显示了我国六亿五千万人民加速社会主义建设的雄心壮志；生动地反映出党的建设社会主义总路线的巨大生命力；闪耀着创造性的马克思主义——毛泽东思想的胜利光辉。完全应当相信，通过这次会议的传达与贯彻，我国广大的工人、农民和知识分子，一定会更加鼓足冲天干劲，继续破除迷信，解放思想，把正在开展着的波澜壮阔的以技术革新与技术革命为中心的生产运动，推向更高的水平，为胜利地实现1960年的跃进计划，为加快社会主义建设的继续跃进而奋勇前进。
    有人说：“没到过祖国的大西北，就不知道祖国的伟大。”这话一点也不错。“百闻不如一见。”1959年10月至12月间，我随着湖北省慰问支援边疆社会主义建设青壮年代表团，到新疆维吾尔自治区进行了约两个月的慰问活动。在慰问过程中，参观了当地人民公社和新疆军区生产建设兵团的国营农场。不仅看到了内地前往新疆参加社会主义开发和建设事业的优秀儿女所表现出来的那种平地建设，白手起家，战胜困难的革命英雄主义气概和不怕困难、勇往直前的乐观主义精神。而且还看到了全疆以维吾尔族为主的十三个民族亲密无间的团结，携手并肩，同声跃进，在辽阔无边的荒野上，在矿藏丰富的群山中，建立起祖国富饶的粮棉基地，创办了大批的工矿企业。看到新疆各族人民在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，在这张更穷更白的纸上，画出了最新最美的图画，写下了最新最好的诗篇，使我对这块富饶的疆土，刻下了永不忘怀的深情。那些英雄事迹，鼓舞着我以万分激动的心情向这次大会提出大力支援边疆社会主义建设的动议。
    新疆确实是祖国的一片大好山河，物产丰富，地利人和。面积之大相当于两个东北，十六个江苏，比欧洲最大的资本主义国家法国还要大二倍多。新疆还可以增垦许多耕地。水源充沛，日照很长，开发建设起来，将是我国最好最大的棉产基地，也是我国重要的瓜果和畜牧业基地之一。那里的农作物是依靠河水、雪水灌溉，并不“靠天吃饭”，所以年年可以保证丰产。那里的大草原生长着驰名世界的肥羊草等数百种经济价值很高的牧草，可以繁育无数的牛、马、羊群。尤其是我国南水北调的宏伟规划实现之后，把长江的水引进新疆，那时不但是可耕地，即使塔克拉玛干等大沙漠也都可以变成绿洲。这种过去只能被认为幻想的神话，将在这伟大的毛泽东时代，变成活生生的现实。
    新疆的矿藏更为丰富。克拉玛依的油田已全国闻名，煤的蕴藏量也极为惊人，还有铁矿和稀有金属等矿藏。新疆确实是个聚宝盆。若是把这些资源开发利用起来，并全部转移到现代化大生产的轨道上去，对加速我国社会主义工业化，对繁荣祖国的边疆，都具有重大意义。
    古语说“人杰地灵”，十年来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，特别是在党的总路线和民族政策光辉照耀下，新疆维吾尔自治区的社会主义建设事业和内地一样，取得了惊人的成就，从根本上改变着解放前的荒凉景象。据了解，解放前全疆不生产一寸钢材，一斤生铁，只有十四个设备陈旧的小型工厂，现在已建成一千五百多个现代化的企业，生产出一些钢铁和各种机械。若加上县办和人民公社办的中小型工业，全区已达一万八千多个工矿企业单位。粮食总产量比解放前增加二点四倍，人民群众的平均收入已相当于解放前的三倍以上。全区各族人民正在为加速社会主义建设而愉快地高歌猛进。从他们的内心深处洋溢着响亮的赞歌：“祖国好，共产党好，毛主席好，社会主义好，人民公社好”！
    在建设社会主义新疆的无数英雄奇迹当中，有一支值得大加赞扬的劳动大军，这就是新疆军区生产建设兵团。这支部队曾经是有着悠久革命历史的、创立了无数战功的人民解放军的一部分，它是在1952年，在王震将军的领导下，模范地执行了党中央开发和建设新新疆的指示，集体转业到农业战线上的。转业之后，为了保持人民解放军的光荣称号，贯彻劳武结合，进行屯垦的方针，在生产建设战线上充分发扬了人民解放军的组织纪律性和战斗化的光荣传统，迄今仍保留着部队的组织形式。在这次慰问活动中，我亲眼看到了兵团农一师为繁荣新疆而创建的丰功伟绩。他们在进疆之后，连续征战的汗渍未干，立即拿起了锄头，投入了生产建设。劈荆斩棘，开荒造田，从简单的“砍土曼”过渡到机械化、半机械化的大农业生产。为了解决兵团和当地兄弟民族的水利问题，修建的干、支渠道长达一千三百多公里。全师已有二十四个大型机械化农场和四个牧场，播种面积达九十七万亩。棉产达到一千七百万斤，粮食达到五千九百万斤。发展各种牲畜二十一万四千多头。大跃进以来，工、副业生产的发展更加振奋人心。从无到有地建立起钢铁厂、电力站、化肥厂、机械厂、拖拉机修配厂、水泥厂等。在总路线的鼓舞下，经过农一师第二总场和第三总场全体官兵的辛勤劳动，在塔里木的塔里木盆地内，仅用一年半的时间，即建立了两个名副其实的“幸福城”，在历来荒无人烟的戈壁滩上树立起向共产主义大进军的里程碑和灯塔。目前的塔里木，真是良田万顷，工厂林立，那里已建立了农业大学、农业技术学校、中、小学、幼儿园、托儿所、新华书店、剧院、工厂、商店等等。谁又能想到这里过去是一片原始森林，荒无人烟呢？在这里使我再次学到了“人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素”的马列主义的真理，更深刻地体会到毛泽东思想是我国社会主义建设事业沿着正确轨道突飞猛进地向前发展的胜利红旗。
    十年来，新疆生产建设兵团和各族人民共同开发和建设的劳动中，模范地执行着党的民族政策，他们与当地人民真诚合作，互相学习，团结互助，特别是在农业机械化耕作和推广先进生产技术的成就，在当地农牧民中产生了极为深远的影响。玛纳斯垦区大面积棉花连年丰产，为各族农民改革植棉技术，开辟了一条崭新的道路。各农场除每年要接待成千上万的农民前来参观，交流经验外，仅在1953—1957年中间，兵团就派出二千五百多名干部，分散去自治区二十五个县内帮助各族人民建立起五百四十九个农业社，发展了生产，并为各农业社培养了技术人员十万多名。每当农忙季节，各农场都派出大批的拖拉机、康拜因、人力和畜力，帮助农业社耕地、播种和收割庄稼。此外，还无偿地为群众开垦荒地六十余万亩，疏浚大小水渠九百五十多公里，建房一千三百多间，医疗疾病三十九万多人次，赠送各种农具四万二千多件，粮食二百九十余万斤。群众反映说：“生产兵团是毛主席教养出来的好部队，处处为我们着想，兵团是我们心上永远忘不了的亲人。”生产兵团同时也获得了当地各族人民的无私支援，群众都把兵团的事业看成是自己的事业。例如，农四师在1958年大炼钢铁时，劳力万分紧张，在温泉有四千多只羊赶不回来，当地的人民公社就自动派了三十多人，骑着马翻过崎岖的天山，往返三十多天，把羊群赶回来了。十团的庄稼在地里收不回来，公社也派出很多劳力帮助抢收，这些劳动都不要一点报酬。像这样的事迹可以说是罄竹难书的。这种亲密无间的团结，是兵团执行党的民族政策的光辉成果。现在，新疆各族人民用鱼和水、血和肉的关系来形容同他们的深厚的友谊。
    新疆生产建设兵团十年来所创建的光辉业绩，不只是当地各族人民有口皆碑，而且，凡是前去参观过的外地人都是赞叹不绝。我们知道越南的胡志明主席，朝鲜人民军代表团都曾到过那里。朱德委员长也曾于1958年视察过，朱委员长赞扬兵团是“最大最好的人民公社。”这是党的评价，也是给予他们的最大荣誉。
    在这个庄严的讲台上，我所以要向各位代表大讲新疆生产建设兵团的情况，一是为了抒发我参观后几个月来念念不忘的情感，二是要
  借新疆生产兵团十年来的光辉事迹说明开发和建设边疆是大有可为的。新疆土地广阔，物产富饶，蕴藏着应有尽有的丰富资源，工业和农牧业都有着极大的发展潜力，是祖国一块宝地。解放十年来，虽然已开发了不少富源，但比之新疆尚待开发的无穷无尽的宝藏，可以说还只是一个开端。新疆地区的经济和文化建设事业，虽然已经较过去是有了特大的跃进，但是仍未彻底消除与内地在经济、文化发展上的不平衡。如果说，我们国家还没有从根本上改变“一穷二白”的面貌，那么新疆可以说还是处在更穷更白的局面。新疆地区人口稀少，技术基础薄弱，交通不发展，在加速社会主义建设的过程中，一方面需要依靠本地区各族人民，在党的领导下，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，乘胜前进，另方面也迫切需要国家和内地各兄弟省区在人力、物力和技术上继续给以大力的支援。
    第一，劳力不足是当前开发和建设新疆地区最大的困难，非常需要内地人民，特别是汉族人民的劳力支援。过去十年来，特别是在大跃进的两年中，有些内地省份在中央的统一领导下，从“支援边疆就是支援全国社会主义建设”的整体观点出发，高度地发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，抽调了大批青壮年去开发和建设祖国的大西北和其他边疆地区，这个革命的举动，无论是在政治上、经济上和国防建设上都具有深远意义。现在，所有到新疆去的青壮年，在当地党政领导和兄弟民族无微不至的关怀和帮助下，根据当地生产的需要，积极地参加了边疆地区的工农业生产。他们经过劳动实践，很快地学会了生产技术，很多人成了拖拉机手和先进生产者，他们的热爱祖国，热爱边疆和兄弟民族的政治觉悟都有更大提高。支援新疆建设的青壮年纷纷反映“农场比家好，党比父母亲”，“北疆到处花果香，南疆富饶赛江南”，决心在那里长期安家立业，扎根开花结果。农业是我国国民经济的基础，为了加速农业生产的发展，中央曾经指出，一方面要继续贯彻执行毛主席的“农业八字宪法”，提高单位面积产量；另方面要积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，我国在三个五年计划期间，准备开垦四亿到五亿亩土地，这是一项极其伟大而艰巨的任务。而开垦大片荒地的主要阵地是在新疆、青海等边疆地区。因此，动员内地青壮年开发和建设边疆是一个长远大计，它反映了我国国民经济迅速发展的要求，也是全国各族人民的最大利益。大家都知道，在我们多民族的统一的社会主义大家庭里，各民族地区的经济、文化建设速度的快慢对整个国家社会主义建设事业的发展会有极大影响。同时，我们的目标是要在全国范围内建立起强大的社会主义经济体系，为过渡到共产主义奠定雄厚的物质基础。因此，就需要根据国民经济按比划发展的规律，来合理的配置生产力。而社会主义生产力配置的主要原则之一，就是尽量使生产接近于原料产地，接近于燃料和动力资源以及产品消费地区和有计划的分配劳动力，由此可见，动员内地青壮年到新疆地区去同当地各族人民一道开发那里的丰富资源，是实现全面的配置生产力，高速度进行社会主义建设的战略部署。因此，我深深希望各内地省份都能及时抽调一批最好的劳力支援祖国边疆建设当成一项光荣任务。实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大力搞好协作，尽早尽快地调动大批青壮年参加新疆地区的开发和建设事业，使新疆与内地齐头并进，把我们伟大祖国的建设成为一座美丽的大花园。
    第二，交通不便是开发和建设新疆地区的第二大困难，需要国家大力支援。大家同样知道，铁路、公路和航线是国民经济的大动脉和输血管。过去十年来，各边疆地区的交通事业有了
  飞跃的发展。这次大会李富春副总理又提出了迅速发展铁路、公路和航运的宏伟计划。听说兰新铁路于今年第二季度即可通车到乌鲁木齐，从西宁通往柴达木等地的铁路也在积极修建，这是值得我们鼓掌欢呼的。但我希望铁道交通部门的领导和广大职工同志们，能更加一把劲，不但把这条中苏友谊之路及早修通，同时要很快的把由乌鲁木齐通到南疆的阿克苏、喀什再到和田、于田直通青海的铁路修通，并以铁路为干线，修建起蛛网式的公路和马车路。修通这些交通线对我国的国民经济发展是极为有利的。不说别的，塔里木内野麻遍地，代代自生自灭，厚达数尺，如能大量运出，即成织造高级衣料的最好原料，伊犁素称粮仓，每年出产的小麦、玉米等堆积如山，但目前运不出来，而新疆各地的矿藏更是应有尽有，急待大力开采外调。所以，提早修通铁路和广泛地建设公路是开发和建设新疆的当务之急。听说中央与自治区党委已经有了大力发展交通事业的计划。我所以提出这个问题，是想起个“催生婆”的作用。铁路修通了，交通运输事业发达了，就会在人们的心理上缩短内地到边疆的距离，进一步加强各民族之间的亲密联系。到那时，我希望各位代表都能到大西北去，到新疆去进行参观访问，看一看祖国的大好河山和那勤劳勇敢的各族兄弟，是怎样执行党的总路线，开发和建设大西北的。
    第三，技术基础薄弱，是边疆社会主义建设中的第三个困难。上面已经谈过，解放前边疆地区的工农业生产技术是极端落后的，如新疆在过去就没有自己生产的一寸钢材，一斤生铁，农业生产有的地区还处在跑马撒种的阶段，完全靠天吃饭，根本谈不上田间管理。解放十年来，工农业生产虽然有了突飞猛进的发展，生产技术也有了许多惊人的革新，但因为土地太多，人口太少，生产技术和生产工具仍然是赶不上形势的发展。今后应随着边疆民族地区社会主义建设事业的要求，把技术革新和技术革命为中心的生产高潮也在新疆地区进一步轰轰烈烈的开展起来。这就需要国家和内地各兄弟省、区多多给予先进技术的援助。如近代化的采矿、炼钢、炼油设备，重型机床、拖拉机、康拜因和各种改良农具等。实际有效地帮助边疆民族地区工农业生产不断高涨，迅速地把新疆地区的丰富资源开发利用起来，又可以支援全国的社会主义建设。
    总之，大西北民族地区是祖国十分可爱的大好河山，幅员广大，蕴藏丰富，地利人和。迅速地开发和建设边疆的前景是十分美好的，十年来的实践证明了是大有可为的。在党的建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，边疆兄弟民族的精神面貌已经发生了深刻的变化，各项生产建设事业同样出现了连续的跃进局面，高速度地改变着边疆地区的经济面貌。那种把新疆和
  “不茅之地”联系起来看问题的人，事实雄辩地说明这是一种早已过了时的，完全不符合事实的片面观点。今后，还需要我们继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，本全国一盘棋的精神，从人力、物力和技术条件上给新疆社会主义建设以更大的支援，为早日建设起繁荣富强的新新疆而共同奋斗。
    以上发言，不妥之处，请各位代表批评指正。
