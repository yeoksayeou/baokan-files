    Agricultural Middle Schools in Jiangsu Province Blossom Like Flowers Throughout the Garden
    Speech by Delegate Guan Wenwei

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the development of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province.

    Over the past two years, agricultural middle schools in our province, these new seedlings in the socialist education garden, have grown vigorously under the careful cultivation of the Party. On March 8, 1958, Shuanglou Township in Hai'an County, our province, established the first agricultural middle school. Following this, Shiqiao Township in Yangzhou established the second agricultural middle school on March 15. On March 17, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee convened a symposium under the personal guidance of Comrade Lu Dingyi, summarizing the experience of these two townships where the masses urgently demanded schools. After the meeting, various regions, based on the experience of these two townships, launched a mass campaign to establish schools. In less than a month, agricultural middle schools spread throughout the vast countryside of our province, and vocational middle schools also developed in cities. "A spring rain overnight, and the garden is full of flowers" has become a beautiful story in the development of agricultural middle schools in our province.

    Currently, our province has 2,174 agricultural (vocational) middle schools, with 279,890 students, accounting for 40.2% of the total number of students in full-time middle schools; among them, there are 51 agricultural (vocational) high schools, with 4,930 students, accounting for 4.3% of the total number of students in full-time high schools. There are 7,900 full-time teachers, with 87% having a cultural level of high school graduation or above. Teaching equipment is also improving. Every school has fixed school buildings, every class has a classroom, and every student has a desk and chair; and all have a certain production base. At present, schools have established 1,446 handicraft workshops (factories) and 115,400 mu of cultivated land. In 1959, the total output value reached 4.74 million yuan, and they have begun to embark on the road of self-sufficiency in production.

    A normal teaching order has been established. Agricultural middle schools throughout the province have a relatively complete set of teaching plans and syllabuses. All schools have three types of courses: political courses, cultural courses, and technical courses, with Chinese and mathematics as the focus of cultural courses. Based on the principle of part-farming and part-study, the schools adopt either half-day or alternate-day classes, with five to six months of study and labor time each year. The teaching time each week is also about 23 hours.

    Because agricultural middle schools have fewer courses and the teaching time is roughly the same as that of ordinary middle schools, and because teaching is combined with labor production and scientific research, they dare to be bold and creative in teaching content and methods, and are flexible and diverse; therefore, the quality of students' knowledge is constantly improving. Taking Class A of the second grade of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County as an example, the average length of the first composition in the first semester was 156 words, with 20 misspelled words; after hard study, the average length of the last composition at the end of the semester was 428 words, with less than one misspelled word. There are many such examples. According to our survey of 993 agricultural middle schools, 553 schools have achieved Chinese and mathematics scores close to or catching up with the level of full-time ordinary middle schools held in the same period. This is no small achievement.

    Developing agricultural middle schools not only enables all primary school graduates in our province to have the opportunity to enter higher education, allowing us to freely popularize primary school education; at the same time, it has also provided us with a way to develop secondary education faster, better, and more economically. According to a survey in Yancheng Prefecture, our province, the state spends 187 yuan a year to train a full-time middle school student, and the family also bears 108 yuan; while to train an agricultural middle school student, the state only spends 18 yuan in subsidies for teacher salaries and teaching equipment, saving the state 169 yuan per person per year. For schools that achieve semi-self-sufficiency, student families only need to bear 38 yuan. The development of agricultural middle schools also prepares conditions for establishing universities in rural areas in the future, opens up a new and broad road for the cultural revolution of "intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals," and also plays a certain role in eliminating urban-rural differences, worker-peasant differences, and physical and mental labor differences in the future.

    In the socialist education cause, agricultural middle schools are a new thing. Like all new things, its creation and development path is not smooth sailing, but rather goes through serious struggles. This struggle is a struggle between bourgeois educational thought and proletarian educational thought; at the same time, it is also a struggle between advanced thought and backward thought.

    When agricultural middle schools first started, they were resisted by bourgeois educational thought. They said things like "not standardized," "won't last long," and "won't be done well." Regarding these wrong ideas, Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out at the time: "In the eyes of 'experts,' this kind of school is not standardized and not worthy of attention, and we must fight against this kind of thinking." This was a great encouragement to us. We believed that since agricultural middle schools are needed for building socialism and are needed by the broad masses, they have a deep social foundation, and under the leadership of the Party, they will definitely be able to defeat these wrong ideas and run agricultural middle schools well. Therefore, we vigorously publicized the advantages of agricultural middle schools and severely criticized the erroneous arguments of the bourgeoisie. We correctly implemented the policy of "Party committee leadership, mass schooling, part-farming and part-study, and running schools diligently and thriftily" put forward by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, closely relied on the masses, selected and assigned teachers locally, organized forces, formulated teaching plans, formulated teaching syllabuses, compiled teaching materials, and mobilized the entire people to support agricultural middle schools. In this way, agricultural middle schools developed vigorously throughout the province like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Our struggle with bourgeois educational thought achieved the first round of victory. Next, we encountered the difficulty of a lack of teachers; especially in the Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Yancheng areas, the difficulties were greater. We mobilized 1,800 high school graduates in southern Jiangsu who had not entered higher education, and after a short period of training, went to support these areas. After the teacher problem was solved, a new problem soon appeared, that is, there were too many agricultural middle schools, the layout was unreasonable, and the number of students was affected by the lack of space. In some places, brigade and team cadres and commune members who were too old also participated in the study. Based on this situation, we reasonably adjusted the layout and mobilized cadres and commune members who were too old to transfer to spare-time schools, so that agricultural middle schools were initially stabilized. At that time, there was also a most prominent problem, that is, the teaching quality was not high. In order to solve this problem, we adopted the methods of organizing lecturer groups, setting up points in separate areas, lecturing in rotation, establishing a guidance network centered on ordinary middle schools, teachers' colleges holding correspondence courses, and organizing short-term intensive training schools to train and improve teachers through a single subject approach. Through the above series of efforts, the teaching level of teachers has rapidly improved. According to a survey of 164 teachers in Dongtai County, the number of teachers with relatively high teaching ability has increased from 31 at the beginning of the school to 71, and the number of teachers with poor teaching ability has decreased from 40 to 5. Because these teachers are young and less affected by bourgeois educational thought, they dare to be bold and creative. They have established the ambition of "being red in agricultural middle school and specializing in agricultural middle school," established close ties with the masses, and established a comradely teacher-student relationship with students. Under relatively difficult conditions, they constantly overcame various difficulties, worked hard, and humbly learned, and their socialist consciousness and teaching level have greatly improved. Among them, many outstanding teachers and advanced schools have emerged. Two hundred and thirty advanced units and five hundred and twelve advanced workers participated in the provincial agricultural middle school advanced units and advanced workers representative conference held in our province in December 1959 alone. A new and prosperous atmosphere has appeared in agricultural middle schools. After the teaching quality improved, we began to solve the funding problem of agricultural middle schools. If the funding of agricultural middle schools is all solved by the state or all solved by the communes, it is temporarily impossible. However, if the funding problem is not solved, it will affect the consolidation and development of agricultural middle schools. In May 1959, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee put forward the production policy of "through half a day of production labor, focusing on high-yield cash crops and sideline industries (handicraft), and developing agriculture and sideline industries simultaneously," so as to achieve most or all of the funding self-sufficiency within two years or a slightly longer period. A vigorous movement for self-sufficiency in production was launched in agricultural middle schools throughout the province. After a year of efforts, certain achievements have been made. At present, among the agricultural middle schools in the province, 19% have achieved complete self-sufficiency in terms of teacher salaries, school office expenses, student book expenses and food expenses, 18.6% have achieved most self-sufficiency, and 31.8% have achieved half self-sufficiency. In this way, agricultural middle schools have truly taken root in rural areas. This year, we require that all those who have achieved complete self-sufficiency should further consolidate their achievements and stabilize their income; those who have achieved most self-sufficiency or half self-sufficiency should strive to achieve complete self-sufficiency or most self-sufficiency; and those with less production income should also actively create conditions and strive to make significant achievements. The reason why we can overcome difficulties step by step and achieve such great victories is, in the final analysis, inseparable from the strengthening of the leadership of agricultural middle schools by Party committees at all levels from beginning to end. Without the leadership of the Party committee, these difficulties would be difficult to overcome; therefore, it would not be possible to achieve the current victory.

    Due to the continuous development of production, the further combination of teaching, production labor, and scientific research in agricultural middle schools has not only promoted the improvement of teaching quality and solved the funding difficulties of schools; but also attracted students' interest in learning, consolidated the number of students, and greatly improved the attendance rate. The development of agricultural middle schools has also greatly promoted the technical innovation movement in rural areas. The schools themselves have also created many advanced production technologies and have begun to become bases for improving rural culture and promoting agricultural science and technology. For example, Yonggan Agricultural Middle School in Rugao County has adopted methods such as sprout planting, transplanting, and block planting for spring potatoes, which greatly saves seed potatoes; the school has also adopted the method of indoor pre-germination before sowing to try to plant autumn potatoes, and the effect is very good. The meteorological station of Yuhua Agricultural Middle School in Dafeng County has achieved a prediction accuracy rate of over 95%. The masses praised and said: "Yuhua Agricultural Middle School has great magical powers, it rains when it says it will rain, and the wind blows when it says it will blow." The hand-operated powder spraying machine created by Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County has been mass-produced and promoted by local agricultural tool factories. The role of agricultural middle schools in rural areas as one institute (scientific research institute) and four stations (technology promotion station, animal husbandry and veterinary station, pest and disease prevention station, meteorological station) has become increasingly significant. The broad masses of grassroots cadres have also increasingly intimately recognized the role it plays in promoting production. In the past, some grassroots cadres once believed that agricultural middle schools occupied labor and hindered production. They wanted to change it into a spare-time school, or even treated it as a production commando team and pulled it around. Now, they have also changed this understanding. They said: "Agricultural middle school is a treasure, every society needs it, and caring for agricultural middle school is caring for the commune." They treat agricultural middle schools as "gold" and "treasure."

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, agricultural middle schools in our province have broken through the heavy obstacles of various bourgeois educational thoughts and overcome various difficulties step by step, and have taken root in rural areas. The era when there was no culture in the countryside is gone forever. The fact that agricultural middle schools in our province are becoming more and more numerous and better and better has bankrupted the predictions of those bourgeois "prophets," and they have had to admit defeat in the face of the facts. At present, although agricultural middle schools still have some shortcomings; in the future, they will also encounter some difficulties; however, these shortcomings and difficulties can be completely overcome. Now, agricultural middle schools in our province have entered a new and more sound development stage. This is the great victory of the general line, the great victory of the Great Leap Forward, the great victory of the people's commune, and the great victory of Mao Zedong's educational thought.

    This summer and next spring, agricultural middle schools in our province will begin to have 130,000 graduates. We plan to have most of the graduates be distributed locally by the people's communes and transferred to production and work; and through spare-time study, they will continue to receive education. This will be a large reserve force of technical forces in rural areas. A small number of graduates will continue to enter higher-level full-time or part-time middle schools; and the communes will select a few outstanding students and send them to urban senior high schools or secondary vocational schools. At the same time, we will develop agricultural middle schools more and better in accordance with the policy of "actively promoting, vigorously developing, timely consolidating, and continuously improving." We plan to develop junior high schools to 1.45 million by 1967, with an average of 287 agricultural middle school junior high school students per 10,000 people. With the increase in junior high school graduates, we plan to develop half-work and half-study agricultural high schools while actively developing agricultural spare-time high schools to meet the requirements of students under the age of sixteen to continue their studies. We plan that 30% of students will focus on learning basic courses to train senior technical cadres and theoretical cadres in the future, as well as teachers needed for the development of higher education in rural areas; 70% of students will focus on learning professional courses, which are actually secondary vocational schools, to train various technical personnel and management cadres for the people's communes. When the conditions are ripe, we will also establish agricultural universities in rural areas.

    We have full confidence and determination to further improve agricultural middle schools on the existing basis.

    江苏省农业中学如花开满园
    管文蔚代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。现在，我仅就江苏省农业中学发展的情况，发表一些意见。
    两年来，我省农业中学，这株社会主义教育园地里的新苗，在党的尽心培育下，已经茁壮成长起来了。1958年3月8日，我省海安县双楼乡创办了第一所农业中学，接着扬州施桥乡在3月15日办起了第二所农业中学。3月17日，中共江苏省委又召开了座谈会，在陆定一同志亲自指导下，总结了这两个乡群众迫切要求办学的经验。会后，各地根据这两个乡的经验，风起云涌地掀起了群众性的办学热潮。在不到一个月的时间里，农业中学就遍布我省广大农村，职业中学也随着在城市发展起来。“一夜春雨，满园花开。”成为我省农业中学发展中的佳话。
    现在我省已有农（职）业中学二千一百七十四所，学生二十七万九千八百九十人，占全日制中学在校学生数的40.2％；其中农（职）业高中五十一所，学生四千九百三十人，占全日制高中在校学生数的4.3％。专职教师有七千九百人，高中毕业以上文化程度的占87％。教学设备也日益完善。校校有固定校舍，班班有教室，人人有课桌椅；并且都有了一定的生产基地。现在，各校已经建立手工业工场（厂）一千四百四十六所，耕地十一万五千四百亩。1959年，全年生产的总产值达到四百七十四万元，已经开始走上生产自给的道路。
    正常的教学秩序已经建立起来。全省农业中学都有了一套比较完整的教学计划和教学大纲。各校都设有政治课、文化课和技术课三类课程，其中文化课是以语文和数学为重点。根据半耕半读的原则，各校采取半日制或隔日制两种形式上课，每年各有五到六个月的学习和劳动的时间。每一周的教学时间也有二十三小时左右。
    农业中学由于课程项目少，教学时间和普通中学大体相同，教学又与劳动生产、科学研究相结合，在教学内容和方法上敢于大胆创造，灵活多样；因而，学生的知识质量不断提高。以江阴县西石桥农业中学二年级甲班为例，该班上学期第一次的作文，平均每篇一百五十六个字，错别字有二十个；经努力学习后在学期最后一次作文时，平均每篇四百二十八个字，错别字不到一个，这样的例子很多。根据我们对九百九十三所农业中学的调查，语文和数学成绩，接近或赶上当地同期举办的全日制普通中学水平的有五百五十三所学校。这是一个不小的成就。
    发展农业中学，不仅使我省高小毕业生全部得到升学的机会，可以放手普及小学教育；同时，还给我们找到了一条多快好省地发展中等教育事业的途径。据我省盐城专区调查，培养一个全日制的中学生，国家一年要支出一百八十七元，家庭负担也要一百零八元；而培养一个农业中学学生，国家只在教师工资和教学设备方面支出补助费十八元，每人每年可为国家节省经费一百六十九元。实现半自给的学校，学生家庭只要负担三十八元。发展农业中学，还为将来在农村中建立高等学校准备了条件，为实现“工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化”的文化革命，开辟了一条新的广阔的道路，也为将来消灭城乡差别、工农差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动差别起一定的作用。
    在社会主义教育事业中，农业中学是一个新生的事物。和其他一切新生事物一样，在它创办和发展的道路上不是一帆风顺的，而是经过严重的斗争的。这种斗争，是资产阶级教育思想和无产阶级教育思想的斗争；同时，也有先进思想和落后思想的斗争。
    在农业中学刚开始创办的时候，它就受到资产阶级教育思想的抵抗。他们说什么“不正规”、“办不长”、“办不好”。对于这些错误思想，陆定一同志当时就指出：“这种学校在‘专家’们的眼光中，是不正规的，看不上眼的，我们必须同这种思想作斗争”。这对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。我们相信，农业中学既然是建设社会主义所需要的，是广大群众所需要的，它有着深厚的社会基础，在党的领导下，就一定能够击败这些错误思想，把农业中学办起来。因此，我们大力地宣传了农业中学的优越性，严厉地批判了资产阶级的错误论调。我们正确地执行了江苏省委提出的“党委领导，群众办学，半耕半读，勤俭办学”的方针，紧紧依靠群众，就地选配教师，组织力量，拟订教学计划，拟订教学大纲，编写教材，动员全民来支援农业中学。这样，农业中学就在全省范围内像雨后春笋般蓬勃地发展起来。我们和资产阶级教育思想的斗争，取得了第一个回合的胜利。接着，我们遇到的是教师缺乏的困难；特别是在徐州、淮阴、盐城地区的困难多一些。我们就在苏南地区动员了未升学的高中毕业生一千八百人，经过短期训练，去支援这些地区。教师问题解决以后，不久又出现了一个新的问题，这就是，农业中学太多，布局不合理，影响学额的不足。有的地方的社队干部和年龄过大的社员也参加了学习。根据这种情况，我们合理地调整了布局，动员已经入学的干部和年龄过大的社员，转入业余学校学习，使农业中学初步稳定下来。当时，还有一个最突出的问题，就是教学质量不高。为了解决这个问题，我们采取了组织讲师团，分片设点，巡回讲学；建立以普通中学为中心的辅导网；师范学院举办函授，组织短期速成进修学校，以单科独进的方式，来培养和提高师资。经过以上一连串的努力，教师的教学水平迅速得到提高，据东台县对一百六十四个教师的调查，目前教学能力较高的，已由初办时的三十一人上升到七十一人，教学能力较差的，已由四十人下降为五人。这批教师由于年纪轻，受资产阶级教育思想的影响较少，敢于大胆创造。他们立下了“红在农中，专在农中”的雄心大志，和群众建立了密切的联系，和学生建立了同志式的师生关系。他们在比较艰苦的条件下，不断克服各种困难，刻苦钻研，虚心学习，社会主义觉悟和教学水平有了很大的提高。在他们中间已经涌现出不少优秀教师和先进学校。仅参加我省1959年12月召开的全省农业中学先进单位和先进工作者代表会议的就有先进单位二百三十个，先进工作者五百一十二人。农业中学出现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。教学质量提高以后，我们就着手解决农业中学的经费问题，农业中学的经费，如果全部由国家解决，或者由公社全部解决，暂时尚不可能。但是，经费问题不解决，就要影响农业中学的巩固和发展。1959年5月，江苏省委就提出“通过半天生产劳动，以高产经济作物和副业（手工业）为主，农副业同时并举”的生产方针，在两年内或再稍长一些时间内，做到经费大部自给或全部自给。全省农业中学就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产自给运动。经过一年的努力，已经取得了一定的成绩。目前全省农业中学，在教师工资、学校办公费、学生书籍簿本费和伙食费方面，达到完全自给的占19％，大部自给的占18.6％，半自给的占31.8％。这样，农业中学便在农村中真正扎下了根。今年，我们要求：凡是已经实现全部自给的，要进一步巩固成绩，稳定收入；已经大部自给或半自给的，力争实现全部自给或大部自给；生产收入较少的，也要积极创造条件，争取做出显著的成绩来。我们所以能够一步一步地克服困难，取得这样大的胜利，归根结底，是与各级党委自始至终加强对农业中学的领导分不开的。如果没有党委的领导，这些困难，是很难克服的；因而，也不可能取得现在的胜利。
    农业中学由于生产的不断发展，教学、生产劳动和科学研究的进一步结合，不仅促进了教学质量的提高，解决了学校经费的困难；而且也吸引了学生的学习兴趣，巩固了学额，大大提高了出席率。农业中学的发展，还大大推动了农村的技术革新运动。学校本身也创造了不少先进生产技术，开始成为提高农村文化。推广农业科学技术的据点，如皋县勇敢农业中学对春马铃薯采取芽栽、移秧栽和块栽等方法，大大节约了种薯；该校还采取播前室内催芽方法，试种秋马铃薯，效果都很好。大丰县裕华农业中学的气象站，预测正确率达到95％以上。群众赞扬说：“裕华农中，大有神通，说雨就雨，说风就风”。江阴县西石桥农业中学创造的手摇喷粉机，已经由当地农具厂大量制造推广。农业中学在农村中所起一所（科学研究所）四站（技术推广站、畜牧兽医站、病虫害防治站、气象站）的作用，已经越来越显著。广大基层干部也愈来愈亲切地认识到它对促进生产所起的作用。过去有些少数基层干部，一度认为：农业中学占用劳动力，妨害生产。他们想把它改成业余学校，甚至把它当作生产突击队而东拉西调。现在，也改变了这种认识。他们说：“农业中学是个宝，社社少不了，关心农中，就是关心公社好。”把农业中学当作“金子”和“宝贝”了。
    在党的正确领导下，我省农业中学，就是这样一步一步地冲破了各种各样的资产阶级教育思想的重重阻碍和克服了各种困难，在农村中生根立足的。农村没有文化的时代一去不复返了。我省农业中学越办越多、越办越好的事实，使那些资产阶级“预言家”的预言破产了，他们在事实面前，不得不服输了。目前，农业中学虽然还存在一些缺点；今后，也还会遇到某些困难；但是，这些缺点和困难是完全可以克服的。现在，我省农业中学已经进入一个新的更加健全发展的阶段。这是总路线的伟大胜利，大跃进的伟大胜利，人民公社的伟大胜利，毛泽东教育思想的伟大胜利。
    在今年夏天和明年春天，我省农业中学开始有十三万毕业生了。我们打算：大部分毕业生由人民公社就地分配，转入生产和工作；并通过业余学习的方式，使他们继续受教育。这将是农村中很大一批技术力量的后备军。其中小部分毕业生将继续升入高一级的全日制或半日制中学学习；并由公社选择少数优秀学生，保送到城市高级中学或中等专业学校学习。与此同时，我们将根据“积极提倡，大力发展，及时巩固，不断提高”的方针，更多更好地发展农业中学。我们计划到1967年，初中发展到一百四十五万人，平均每万人口中有农业中学初中学生二百八十七人。随着初中毕业生的增多，准备在积极发展农业业余高中的同时，发展半工半读的农业高中，以满足十六岁以下的学生继续升学的要求。计划30％的学生以学习基础课为主，为将来培养高级的技术干部和理论干部，以及农村中发展高等教育所需要的师资；70％的学生以学专业课为主，实际上，是中等专业学校，为人民公社培养各种技术人员和经营管理干部。在条件成熟的时候，我们还要在农村中建立农业大学。
    我们完全有信心有决心，在已有的基础上把农业中学进一步办好。
