The Guizhou Provincial Party Congress Calls on the People of the Province to Leap Forward Continuously with All Their Might

(Our report) The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Guizhou Province opened on April 2nd and closed on the 6th, lasting five days.

After the opening ceremony, Comrade Zhou Lin delivered a work report on behalf of the First Committee of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee, entitled "Hold High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Strive to Achieve Sustained Leap Forward." Then the congress held more than two days of general discussions. On the afternoon of the 6th, the congress elected the members and alternate members of the Second Provincial Committee and adopted a resolution on the work report.

The work report first summarized the rapid development of various tasks and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the province since June 1956. The report pointed out that in the three years since the First Congress, after basically completing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, the province extensively and deeply carried out a mass rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the province achieved a sustained great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, successfully completing and overfulfilling the main tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan assigned to Guizhou Province by the state. The report believes that the great leap forward in the past two years is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and a victory of carrying out mass movements on a large scale.

The report then put forward the main tasks for 1960. Regarding agricultural tasks, the report pointed out: it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified undertakings in an all-round way, and strive to achieve the main targets stipulated in the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule in the next three years. In 1960, it is necessary to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the plan to increase grain production by 15% on the basis of the great leap forward in 1959. At the same time, ensure the completion of the production increase plan for various technical crops, and double the number of pigs raised compared with last year, achieving one pig per person in rural areas. This part of the report particularly emphasized that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. The report said: "If agriculture develops, all economic work will be easier to handle. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the high-speed development of agriculture." Regarding industrial tasks, the report pointed out that it is necessary to ensure the completion and overfulfillment ahead of schedule of the plan to increase the total industrial output value by 42% this year compared with 1959, requiring steel production to more than double compared with last year, and vigorously develop and improve the "small-scale modern industrial enterprises." The report also put forward requirements for commerce, finance, trade, culture, education, health, militia, and other work.

The report pointed out that in order to successfully complete the arduous and glorious tasks of industrial and agricultural production in the future, it is necessary to push the mass movement of technical revolution and cultural revolution to a new stage. It is necessary to mobilize all workers, farmers, scientific and technical personnel, and working people from all walks of life in the province to get involved in this movement. The report also pointed out that, according to the actual situation in Guizhou Province, carrying out a mass movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and automation and semi-automation of mechanical operations is the central content of the technical revolution and cultural revolution at the present stage. The report also pointed out that in order to adapt to the in-depth development of the technical revolution, some unreasonable rules and regulations and unreasonable labor organizations that are not suitable for the development of productive forces should be reformed in a timely manner.

Regarding the people's commune issue, the report pointed out that since the realization of people's communes in rural areas throughout the province, in a short period of more than a year, the people's communes have fully demonstrated their strong vitality and incomparable superiority, and are moving towards a path of consolidation and development. Moreover, a large number of well-run people's communes have emerged throughout the province. Among them, Changshi People's Commune is the most vivid red banner. According to the experience of these well-run people's communes, the following links should be grasped in order to consolidate and develop the people's communes: First, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes and promote greater development of production. Second, be determined to lead poor teams to catch up with rich teams. Encourage all poor teams to establish ambitious goals, launch a movement for poor teams to catch up with rich teams, and strive to make the poor teams in the province basically catch up with or approach the level of rich teams this year. Third, conscientiously run the collective enterprises and actively develop the collective economy. Fourth, adhere to the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system to ensure the lives of the vast number of commune members and fully mobilize their labor enthusiasm. Fifth, the people's communes must grasp both production and life with one hand. Rural public canteens are an important socialist position in rural areas and an important link in consolidating and developing the people's commune system and ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Party organizations must vigorously strengthen their leadership over the canteens and do a good job in the canteen work. Sixth, continue to carry out socialist and communist education, improve the communist consciousness of the vast number of cadres and commune members, advocate the communist attitude towards labor, and promote the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, as well as the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration.

The report also pointed out that to run the people's communes well, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to the Party's class line in rural areas. Regarding the work of organizing urban people's communes, Party organizations should adopt a positive attitude and earnestly strengthen their leadership.

The last part of the report focused on holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the whole Party being of one mind, with one spirit, marching in unison, and advancing victoriously. The report pointed out that the Party organizations at all levels and all Party members in Guizhou Province, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, after several years of training, especially after the socialist political and ideological revolution movement in 1957 and the struggle against Right-leaning opportunism in 1959; and after two years of continuous great leap forward in socialism, have greatly improved their ideological level, the Party's organization has greatly developed, the Party's combat strength has been significantly enhanced, the Party's unity has been further strengthened, and the Party's style and life have greatly improved. In the future socialist construction, it is necessary to hold higher the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Always maintain revolutionary vigor. The whole Party is of one mind, with one spirit, marching in unison, and pushing socialist construction from victory to greater victory.

The report pointed out that in the cause of transition from socialism to communism, many difficulties will be encountered. Striving to overcome the difficulties in practical work is an important aspect of tempering our tenacious firmness. Similarly, if we become arrogant because of certain achievements in our work, adopt a careless and irresponsible attitude towards problems in our work, or stay high above, not go deep, and be satisfied with holding meetings, issuing documents, and talking empty words, etc., this bureaucratic style of work is harmful to our cause and must be resolutely overcome.

The report pointed out that our socialist revolution and construction are the cause of millions of people themselves. As long as we cherish the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses with the utmost care, unswervingly stand at the forefront of the mass movement, lead the masses forward, and integrate with the masses, we can withstand all evil winds and overcome all difficulties in our progress. The report pointed out that we must always maintain revolutionary vigor, wholeheartedly support the growth of new things, and "clear the way" for new things. The report also pointed out that we must constantly improve our communist consciousness, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, frequently conduct criticism and self-criticism, abide by discipline, and implement the Party's policies, lines, and principles in order to maintain the purity of our Party's ranks in politics, organization, and ideology.

The report finally pointed out that carrying out a movement to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and publicize Comrade Mao Zedong's thought among Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of people in the province is an extremely important task of the Party. Party committees at all levels and leading comrades of Party units must take up this task personally, set an example, adhere to regular study, and closely combine leadership work with leadership study. Through study, the whole Party, especially the leading cadres of the Party at all levels, is required to master the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought well, sum up the practical experience in socialist construction, draw a clear line between Marxism-Leninism and non-Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely wage a struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and the reactionary trends of thought of Right-leaning opportunism and revisionism in order to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies. At the same time, we should systematically cultivate our province's Party theoretical work team and strive to continuously improve the ideological and theoretical level of our province's Party.

    贵州省党代会号召全省人民
    一股劲持续向前跃进
    本报讯　中国共产党贵州省第二次代表大会，于4月2日开幕，会议历时五天于6日闭幕。
    会议在举行开幕式后，周林同志代表中共贵州省第一届委员会向大会作了题为“高举毛泽东思想旗帜，为实现持续跃进而奋斗”的工作报告。接着大会进行了两天多的大会讨论。6日下午大会选举了第二届省委委员与候补委员，并通过了关于工作报告的决议。
    工作报告首先对1956年6月以来，全省各项工作的飞速发展，工农业生产的大跃进作了总结。报告指出，从第一次代表大会以来的三年多时间里，全省在基本上完成了对于农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造之后，于1957年广泛深入地开展了全民性的整风运动和反右派斗争，取得了政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了1958年与1959年的持续大跃进，胜利完成和超额完成了国家给予贵州省的第二个五年计划的主要任务。报告认为，两年来的大跃进，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利。
    报告接着提出1960年的主要任务。关于农业方面的任务，报告中指出：要继续贯彻执行以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针，争取在今后三年内提前实现十二年农业发展纲要所规定的主要指标。1960年，要保证完成并力争超额完成粮食生产在1959年大跃进的基础上增产15％的计划。同时保证完成各项技术作物的增产计划，养猪要在去年基础上翻一番，实现农村人口每人一头猪。报告的这一部分，特别强调了农业是国民经济发展的基础。报告中说：农业发展了，一切经济工作就好办了。因此，必须保证农业的高速度发展。关于工业方面的任务，报告指出，必须保证提前和超额完成今年工业总产值比1959年增长42％的计划，要求钢产量比去年增产一倍以上，大力发展和提高“小洋群”。报告对商业财贸、文化、教育、卫生、民兵等工作，都提出了要求。
    报告中指出，为了胜利实现今后工农业生产的繁重而光荣的任务，必须把技术革命与文化革命的群众运动，推向一个新的阶段。要把全省工人、农民、科学技术人员和各行各业的劳动群众统统发动起来，卷入这个运动。报告中还指出，根据贵州省的实际情况，开展手工操作机械化半机械化、机械操作自动化半自动化的全民运动，是现阶段技术革命与文化革命的中心内容。报告同时指出，为了适应技术革命的深入开展，一些不适应生产力发展的、不合理的规章制度以及不合理的劳动组织都应及时进行改革。
    关于人民公社问题，报告中指出，自全省农村实现人民公社化以来，在短短的一年多时间里，人民公社已充分显示了它的强大的生命力和无比优越性，走向巩固发展的道路。并且全省已经出现了一大批办得好的人民公社。其中长石人民公社就是一面最鲜艳的红旗。根据这批办得好的人民公社的经验，目前巩固和发展人民公社应该抓住以下几个环节：第一，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，促进生产的更大发展。第二，下决心领导穷队赶上富队。鼓励所有的穷队，树立雄心大志，开展一个穷队赶富队运动，力争今年内使全省穷队基本上赶上或接近富队水平。第三，认真办好社有企业，积极发展社有经济。第四，坚持工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，保证广大社员的生活，充分发挥社员的劳动积极性。第五，人民公社必须一手抓好生产；一手抓好生活。农村公共食堂是农村社会主义的重要阵地，是巩固和发展人民公社制度，保证农业生产继续跃进的重要环节。党的组织必须大力加强对食堂的领导，搞好食堂工作。第六，继续进行社会主义和共产主义教育，提高广大干部和社员的共产主义觉悟，提倡共产主义的劳动态度，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格和共产主义大协作的精神。
    报告中还指出，要办好人民公社，必须加强党的领导，坚持党在农村的阶级路线。对于组织城市人民公社的工作，党的组织应当以积极态度，切实加强领导。
    报告的最后一部分，着重讲高举毛泽东思想旗帜，全党一条心，一股劲，整齐步伐，乘胜前进的问题。报告指出，贵州省的各级党组织和全体党员，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，经过这几年的锻炼，特别是经过1957年的社会主义政治思想革命运动和1959年的反对右倾机会主义的斗争；经过两年来社会主义的连续大跃进，思想水平有了很大的提高，党的组织有很大发展，党的战斗力量有显著的增强，党的团结得到了进一步加强，党的作风和党的生活都有了很大进步。在今后的社会主义建设事业中，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，和党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜。永远保持革命的朝气。全党一条心，一股劲，整齐步伐，把社会主义建设从胜利推向更大的胜利。
    报告指出，在从社会主义向共产主义过渡的事业中，会遇到许多困难的。努力克服实际工作中的困难，是锻炼我们顽强的坚定性的一个重要方面。同样，如果我们因为工作得到某些成绩而骄傲起来，对工作中的问题，采取满不在乎和不负责任的态度，或是高高在上，不深入，满足于开会、发公文、说空话等等官僚主义作风，是危害我们的事业的，必须坚决克服。
    报告中指出，我们社会主义的革命和建设事业，是千百万群众自己的事业。只要我们极仔细地爱护群众的革命积极性，坚定不移地站在群众运动的前面，领导群众前进，和群众打成一片，就可以顶住一切歪风邪气，克服一切前进中的困难。报告指出，我们必须永远保持革命朝气，满腔热情的扶持新生事物的成长，为新生事物“鸣锣开道”。报告还指出，我们要不断地提高共产主义觉悟，认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，经常开展批评和自我批评，遵守纪律，贯彻党的方针、路线、政策，以保持我们党的队伍在政治上、组织上、思想上的纯洁性。
    报告最后指出，在全省各级党的组织和广大人民群众中开展学习毛泽东同志的著作，宣传毛泽东同志思想的运动，是党的一项极端重要的任务。各级党委和各单位党的领导同志，必须把这项任务亲自抓起来，以身作则，坚持经常学习，把领导工作和领导学习紧紧地结合起来。通过学习，要求全党，特别是党的各级领导干部，很好地掌握毛泽东思想的武器。总结在社会主义建设中的实践经验。划清马列主义与非马列主义的界限，并向各种各样的资产阶级思想，向右倾机会主义、修正主义的反动思潮进行坚决的斗争，以捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则，保证党的路线、方针、政策的正确执行。同时，应当有计划地培养我省党的理论工作队伍，为不断地提高我省党的思想水平和理论水平而努力。　　　（萧明）
