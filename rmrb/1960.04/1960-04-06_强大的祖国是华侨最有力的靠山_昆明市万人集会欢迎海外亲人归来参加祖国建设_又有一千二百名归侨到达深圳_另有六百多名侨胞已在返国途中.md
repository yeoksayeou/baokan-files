Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 3rd: Another 1,200 returned overseas Chinese arrived in Shenzhen at noon today. They were welcomed by Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Fu Rongding, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province, and Gao Tianmei, head of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

　　This group of returned overseas Chinese arrived via Hong Kong on the Zhilihua. Except for about ten people from Singapore and Malaya, the others were from Indonesia. Some of the returned overseas Chinese are overseas Chinese students returning to study, and a small number are returning home to visit relatives. Zhong Qingfa warmly shook hands with Cai Yongsen, an old carpenter who returned to China, at the Shenzhen bridgehead, welcoming them back to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. More than 100 carpenters from Surabaya came with Cai Yongsen. Sixty-five-year-old Cai Yongsen was very thinly dressed, carrying an iron bucket and an old leather suitcase, which contained his old tools such as planes, saws, and drills, as well as seven or eight sets of light clothing, which he had used as a carpenter for more than 40 years. The reception staff put cotton clothes on him and sent him to the Overseas Chinese Service Center to rest. Also present in Shenzhen today to welcome their relatives were the heads of the Overseas Chinese Federation of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and Situ Zan, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and former chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Association.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 3rd: More than 600 overseas Chinese who recently returned from Indonesia to Yunnan to participate in socialist construction arrived in Kunming from Zhanjiang on the 2nd and were warmly welcomed by more than 10,000 people from all ethnic groups in Kunming.

　　On the 2nd, when seventeen buses full of returned overseas Chinese drove into Kunming City, the streets were filled with gongs and drums, applause and firecrackers. Cui Jiequan, member of the Standing Committee of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Kunming City, Li Yougui, Director of the Office of the Yunnan Provincial Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, and Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, first went to the front of the bus to shake hands with the overseas Chinese, expressing warm welcome and cordial greetings. Then, more than 300 cadres and students rushed to the front of the bus to hold children and take luggage for the overseas Chinese. Huang Xianniang, an elderly woman who suffered from quadriplegia in Indonesia, and five other patients were taken to the hospital by ambulance as soon as they got off the bus. The elderly couple Wei Yongcai, who were over seventy years old, and Xie Yuniang, who was eighty-five years old, were old and frail, so the reception staff carried them on their backs or lifted them up. When the overseas Chinese passed through the welcoming crowd, they were so moved by the warm welcome from their compatriots that they raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party of China!"

　　A welcome meeting was then held. Cui Jiequan, on behalf of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Kunming Municipal People's Committee, and more than one million people in Kunming, expressed a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese at the meeting. He expressed his indignation at the large number of overseas Chinese who were displaced in Indonesia because of persecution. He pointed out that a strong motherland is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese, and the motherland has sufficient strength and conditions to arrange the work, study and life of the overseas Chinese.

　　Liao Shilong, the representative of the returned overseas Chinese, expressed his warm gratitude to the Party, government, and people of Kunming City on behalf of more than 600 overseas Chinese in his reply. He said that now we have crossed thousands of mountains and rivers and returned to the warm embrace of the motherland, but we still have many relatives who are still being persecuted in Indonesia. We firmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's recent reply to the Indonesian Foreign Minister and demand that the Indonesian authorities immediately stop obstructing the return of overseas Chinese and promptly send them back to China so that our relatives can be reunited as soon as possible.

　　After the meeting, the buses took the returned overseas Chinese to the hotels specially prepared for them. The work of these returned overseas Chinese will be properly arranged in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 5th: The "Yakutia," one of the third batch of ships sent by the Chinese government to pick up Indonesian overseas Chinese returning to China, left Jakarta last night with more than 600 displaced overseas Chinese from West Java on board.

　　These overseas Chinese came from Bekasi, Serang, and Cirebon. During their stay in Jakarta, they were warmly received by overseas Chinese organizations. The Chinese Embassy and Consulate General were very concerned about their lives.

　　Last night, Li Jusheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and Consul General in Jakarta, as well as consuls and representatives of overseas Chinese organizations, went to the port to see them off. The overseas Chinese were very moved and excited, and they sang heartily on the deck. The overseas Chinese from Bekasi repeatedly sang the song "Orphans Abroad Have a Mother."

　　The ship left Jakarta amidst cheers and slogans and sailed towards the bright and splendid motherland they had been looking forward to day and night. The "Russia," another ship in the third batch, is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta today.

    接着举行了欢迎大会。崔洁泉代表中共昆明市委、昆明市人民委员会和昆明市一百多万人民，在会上向归国华侨表示热烈欢迎。他对大批华侨在印度尼西亚因为受到迫害而流离失所表示愤慨。他指出，强大祖国是华侨最有力的靠山，祖国有足够的力量和条件来安排侨胞们的工作、学习和生活。
    归侨代表廖世隆在答词中代表六百多侨胞向昆明市的党、政府和人民表示热烈感谢。他说，现在我们算是越过万水千山回到祖国的温暖的怀抱了，但是我们还有许多亲人仍在印度尼西亚受到迫害，我们坚决拥护陈毅外长最近给印度尼西亚外长的复信，要求印度尼西亚当局，立即停止对回国华侨的阻挠，迅速把他们遣送回国，让我们的亲人早日得到团聚。
    会后，汽车又把归侨送到专为他们准备的旅馆里。这些归侨的工作最近期间就将得到妥善安排。
