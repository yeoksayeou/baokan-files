    Being Masters of Nature
    The staff and workers of the Chong'an County Rosin Factory adopted chemical resin tapping to achieve high rosin production. This is a significant innovation in the field of forest chemical industry.
    Rosin is an important industrial raw material with extensive uses. Many industrial productions such as soap, papermaking, paint, rubber, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, matches, transportation and electrical equipment cannot do without it. With the high-speed development of China's industry and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for rosin is increasing and the application is widening. The rosin industry must be greatly developed to meet the growing needs.
    Can rosin production achieve a greater leap forward? The experience of Chong'an provides a completely affirmative answer. Rosin production has always been restricted by seasons. When the season turns cold every year, rosin will not flow out. The actual resin tapping time is only half a year. This natural condition greatly limits rosin production. After adopting the chemical resin tapping method, production can be carried out all year round, regardless of spring, summer, autumn or winter. This innovation has created extremely important and favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in rosin production this year. However, the significance of chemical resin tapping is not limited to this. It once again gives people a profound inspiration: that the objective world can be transformed, and the various unfavorable conditions in production can be transformed. Those who advocate "conditionalism" always absolutize the objective world and temporary difficulties, believing that they are difficult to change. Therefore, they lack confidence and ambition to achieve continued leap forward. This is a slave mentality of succumbing to the objective world and succumbing to material conditions. The existence of this kind of thinking will inevitably suppress the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, making it impossible to give play to the great potential that actually exists in production. We are dialectical materialists. We respect objective laws, but we also believe that people can understand objective laws and can exert subjective initiative to transform nature, thereby mastering nature. When people understand objective laws and use them to seek benefits for the people, nature's control over people is transformed into people's control over nature. The chemical resin tapping method in Chong'an is a good example.
    Unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors, which must be realized through people's subjective initiative and must have the communist style of daring to think and act and the soaring revolutionary spirit. It has long been the case that resin cannot be tapped in winter. For a long time, under the control of nature, people can only "go up the mountain during Qingming and come down the mountain during Frost's Descent," which is a difficulty in increasing rosin production. However, in the Great Leap Forward, the resin tapping workers of Chong'an knew the difficulties and advanced, boldly envisioned, dared to declare war on nature, carried out a great revolution in resin tapping methods, adopted chemical resin tapping, made the severe cold powerless, and won high rosin production. In this process, the climate in Chong'an has not changed, and nature has not given any special gifts. It is only because people's mental outlook and enthusiasm have changed that two completely different results have been created in production. This incident once again shows the decisive role of enthusiasm.
    Let us earnestly learn from the communist style of daring to think, speak and act of the rosin tapping workers in Chong'an, learn from their soaring revolutionary spirit and skillful work spirit, seize high production of rosin, and realize the continued leap forward in various production and construction undertakings.

    当大自然的主人
    崇安县松香厂的职工采用化学采脂夺取了松香高产，这是林产化工方面一个具有重大意义的创举。
    松香是一项重要的工业原料，用途很大。肥皂、造纸、油漆、橡胶、制药、化工、火柴、交通电工器材等许多种工业生产都少不了它。随着我国工业的高速度发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，松香的需要量越来越大，需要面越来越广，松香工业必须大大地发展，方能满足日益增长的需要。
    松香生产能不能实现更大跃进呢？崇安的经验给了完全肯定的回答。松香生产历来受季节限制，每年季节一转冷，松脂就流不出来了，一年实际采脂时间只有半年，这种自然条件给松香生产以很大限制。采用化学采脂方法后，不分春夏秋冬，一年四季都可生产。这一创举，为今年松香生产的更大跃进创造了极其重要的有利条件。但是，化学采脂的意义还不止于此，它又一次给人们思想上以深刻的启发：这就是客观世界是可以改造的，生产中的种种不利条件是可以转化的。“唯条件论”者总是把客观世界、把暂时的困难绝对化，认为是很难改变的，因而对实现继续跃进信心不足，缺乏雄心壮志。这是一种屈服于客观世界，屈服于物质条件的奴隶思想。存在着这种思想，就必然压抑群众的积极性和创造性，使生产中实际存在的巨大潜力得不到发挥。我们是辩证唯物论者，我们尊重客观规律，但同时也认为人能认识客观规律，能够发挥主观能动作用去改造自然，从而驾驭自然。当人们认识了客观规律，并利用它为人们谋福利时，自然对人的支配就转化为人对自然的支配。崇安的化学采脂方法就是一个很好的例子。
    不利因素转化为有利因素，必须通过人的主观能动性来实现，必须有敢想敢干的共产主义风格和冲天的革命干劲。冬天不能采脂，由来久矣。长期以来，人们在自然的支配下，只能“清明上山，霜降下山”，这是松香增产中的困难。但是在大跃进中，崇安的采脂工人知难而进，大胆设想，敢于向自然宣战，进行采脂方法大革命，采用化学采脂，使严寒无能为力，夺得了松香高产。在这过程中，崇安的气候没有变，大自然也没有什么特殊的恩赐，只是由于人们的精神面貌和干劲起了变化，就在生产上造成两种完全不同的结果。这件事再次说明了干劲的决定作用。
    让我们认真学习崇安采脂工人敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，学习他们的冲天革命干劲和巧干精神，夺取松香生产的高产，实现各项生产建设事业的继续跃进。　（摘自福建日报）
