Henan Province's Masses Vigorously Build Native Railways
Speech by Representative Jia Xinzhai

Fellow Representatives:

I wholeheartedly endorse the work reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will report to the conference on the situation of Henan Province's vigorous efforts in building native railways.

Building Native Railways Vigorously is Inevitable

The mass movement to vigorously build native railways that has emerged in Henan Province is a product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In 1959, under the situation of the sustained Great Leap Forward in the national economy, due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and capital construction, the volume of transportation of various materials increased sharply, resulting in a contradiction where the volume of material transportation exceeded the transportation capacity. This contradiction was particularly prominent in factory areas and short-distance transportation, due to the great development of the steel, coal, and forestry industries. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, although transportation work in our province has achieved rapid development, it still cannot meet the growing needs of production and construction and commodity circulation. Sometimes, normal production in some factories and mines is affected because transportation cannot keep up with the needs. If this contradiction is not resolved quickly, it will affect the sustained leap forward of the national economy. Therefore, using the method of vigorously building native railways to solve the problem of short-distance transportation is the urgent demand of the broad masses. The situation requires it, and it must be done. Under this situation, in October last year, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Committee, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on vigorously developing a mass movement for short-distance transportation and vigorously developing light railways and native railways, combined with the specific conditions of our province, put forward the policy of relying on the masses, self-reliance, and vigorously developing the native railway movement, first solving the transportation problems of steel, coal, timber and other factories and mines and short-distance transportation. Since then, the mass movement of vigorously building native railways has developed vigorously. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the broad masses gave full play to the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes, broke down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, overcoming all difficulties with soaring enthusiasm, and rapidly forming a climax of vigorously building native railways. From November last year to March 20 this year, in less than five months, the province has completed 778 kilometers of native railways, manufactured 68 locomotives (including 16 steam locomotives), and manufactured more than 11,500 vehicles (including hand-pushed rail cars). Currently, there are still 58 lines under construction, with a total length of 580.2 kilometers. The total length of native railways that have been completed and are under construction is 1,358.2 kilometers, which is equivalent to half the total length of existing foreign-style railways within our province. A large number of technical personnel have been trained in the process of vigorously building native railways. The completion of these native railways has enabled many places to leap from the transportation methods of carrying on shoulders, manual hauling, and human pushing and horse pulling to mechanized and semi-mechanized transportation methods. Vigorously building native railways can not only solve the problem of short-distance transportation in key steel, coal, timber and other production bases, but also greatly improve productivity, reduce enterprise costs, promote the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and change the appearance of production, thereby ensuring the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The 778 kilometers of native railways built in Henan Province in five months can increase the daily transportation volume by about 40,000 tons, which can replace 518 automobiles, or about 4,000 horse-drawn carts, or about 20,000 handcarts. It can save about 35,000 laborers who work in permanent transportation all year round, and save 34.73 million yuan in transportation costs per year. The effect is very significant. This is the victory of the Party's General Line and the "walking on two legs" policy, and the victory of the mass movement for socialist construction.

Since liberation, the national railway construction has achieved rapid development. However, it still cannot meet the growing transportation needs. Vigorously building native railways is an important measure to solve the problem of short-distance transportation. It has many advantages, which can be summarized in the following aspects:

Building Native Railways Has Three Major Advantages

1.  Low investment and easy access to materials. Building native railways on the plains generally requires an investment of only about 50,000 yuan per kilometer, which is only one-seventh of the investment in foreign-style railways. In terms of materials, they can be obtained locally and are easy to solve. Building a foreign-style railway requires 130 tons of steel and 320 cubic meters of wood per kilometer, while building a native railway requires only 80 tons of white pig iron and 65 cubic meters of wood per kilometer. It is also easy to solve the power problem. Steam locomotives or modified automobiles can be used. In the absence of locomotives, human pushing and horse pulling can also improve efficiency.

2.  High efficiency and low freight. For example, the efficiency of a locomotive modified from an automobile on the Jiyuan-Kejing native railway is 10 to 15 times higher than that of an automobile; the efficiency of a locomotive modified from an automobile on the Wuzhi-Zhandian native railway is 50 times higher. Due to high efficiency, freight rates are relatively reduced, saving a large amount of manpower, animal power, and transportation tools. The temporary freight rate per ton-kilometer for the Jiyuan-Kejing native railway is set at 15 cents, which is 490% lower than the freight rate for automobiles, 233% lower than the freight rate for horse-drawn carts, and 500% lower than the freight rate for handcarts. At the same time, it can replace 89 horse-drawn carts or 532 handcarts, saving 100 to 500 people (calculated by horse-drawn carts and handcarts). After several steel plants in Jiaozuo realized rail transportation, more than 4,200 laborers were drawn out to support agricultural and industrial production, and the effect was very good.

3.  It can be run independently by the whole people. Due to low investment, easy access to materials, and easy access to equipment, all areas and factories and mines that have the conditions can run it independently by the whole people. Because of high efficiency and low freight rates, a large number of laborers can be liberated. The enthusiasm of the whole people to run it is even higher. It has a broad mass base and can greatly accelerate the construction speed.

In short, building native railways has the advantages of low investment, easy access to materials, high efficiency, low freight rates, being run by the whole people, and fast speed, and can well solve the problem of short-distance transportation. Therefore, it is an important measure to quickly strengthen the weak links in transportation, and it is fully in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Support This New Thing With Full Enthusiasm

In the mass movement of vigorously building native railways in the past few months, we have deeply realized that to build native railways at high speed, we must strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. The native railway is a new thing, and leaders at all levels have adopted the same attitude as they do towards other new things, supporting and promoting its development with full enthusiasm and initiative. However, there are also a few people who do not believe in the masses and do not see the strength of the masses, thinking that "no matter how great the enthusiasm of the masses is, without steel rails, tools, and technology, it cannot be done," and some say, "Small rails cannot solve big problems." After solving the problem of whether native railways can be built, some comrades look upwards, emphasizing difficulties, reaching out for investment, materials, and equipment, not relying on the masses to overcome difficulties through self-reliance, but lacking enthusiasm and procrastinating; some comrades also have the idea of ​​liking foreign things and disliking native things, passively waiting, and as a result, the foreign things cannot be waited for, and the native things cannot be done either. For these ideas, we must seriously and continuously educate and overcome them in order to ensure the smooth development of the native railway construction movement.

Experience has proven that vigorously building native railways must implement the policy of "walking on two legs" by combining native and foreign methods, and giving priority to native methods before foreign methods. It is necessary to adapt to local conditions, make use of simple tools and methods, and adopt various methods such as locomotive traction, human pushing and horse pulling, first starting with native methods and then gradually improving. Only in this way can the construction of native railways be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

Experience has proven that vigorously building native railways must focus on key points, giving priority to key points over general points, short distances over long distances, and building in a planned and step-by-step manner. First solve the internal transportation of factories and mines and the short-distance collection and transportation of steel mines, coal mines, and timber, in order to meet the current urgent needs. Then gradually solve the short-distance transportation of general materials and the construction of longer lines.

Experience has proven that vigorously building native railways must adopt the policy of self-reliance, being run by the whole people, with the focus on special cities, counties, factories, mines, enterprises and people's communes, supplemented by provincial assistance. There are those invested and run by the province, those invested and run by special districts, those invested and run by counties, and those jointly run by counties and communes, enterprises raising funds themselves, private-public joint ventures, and jointly run by raising funds, so that the enthusiasm of all parties is fully utilized. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of national production and transfer plans, if there is no pig iron, they smelt it themselves; if there is no wood, they fell it themselves; if there is no funds, they raise it themselves; if they do not understand the technology, they learn it themselves. Many places do not ask the state for a catty of iron or a catty of steel, and they rely entirely on self-reliance to build native railways. For example, the Xinxiang Special District launched a 100,000-person iron smelting movement, smelting a large amount of iron for the vigorous construction of native railways, and also adopted methods such as communes providing labor, everyone raising funds, and donating iron and materials. Therefore, they overcame difficulties, accelerated the construction speed, and quickly created a climax of the whole people vigorously building native railways.

In 1960, the situation of the sustained leap forward in the national economy of our province requires us to better solve the transportation problem. In order to seize the breakthrough in the weak link of transportation and meet the urgent needs of the Great Leap Forward situation, we are determined to push the mass movement of the whole people vigorously building native railways to a new and greater climax. The preliminary plan is to build 23 relatively long native railways with a total length of 630 kilometers this year, focusing on solving the problem of short-distance transportation in steel mines, coal mines, forest bases, and large-scale water conservancy construction sites, vigorously developing the rail transportation in factories, mines, enterprises, and fields, and vigorously solving the problem of interface connection between key materials and railways, highways, and docks. We will focus on the complete set of work of native railways, so that native railways and locomotives and vehicles are matched up, and strengthen transportation management and operation, so as to fully play the role and potential of native railways and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

The above speech, if there is anything inappropriate, please correct me, representatives.

### 河南省群众大办土铁路  贾心斋代表的发言

专栏：

    河南省群众大办土铁路
    贾心斋代表的发言各位代表：
    我衷心地拥护李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委会的工作报告。现在，我向大会汇报一下河南省大办土铁路的情况。
    大办土铁路势在必行
    河南省所出现的群众性的大办土铁路运动，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的产物。在1959年国民经济持续大跃进的形势下，由于工农业生产和基本建设的飞跃发展，各种物资的运输量猛烈增长，因而出现了物资运输量大于运输能力的矛盾，特别是在厂区和短途运输方面，由于钢铁、煤炭、森林工业的大发展，这个矛盾表现得更为突出。解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，我省的交通运输工作虽然获得了飞跃的发展，但是，仍然还不能适应日益增长的生产建设和商品流转的需要，某些厂矿和工地有时因为运输赶不上需要而影响正常生产。如果不迅速解决这个矛盾，就要影响国民经济的持续跃进。因此，用大办土铁路的办法来解决短途运输问题，是广大群众的迫切要求。形势所需，事在必为。在这种情况下，去年10月份，中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会遵照党中央、国务院关于大搞短途运输群众运动和大搞轻便铁路、土铁路的指示，结合我省具体情况，提出了依靠群众，自力更生，大搞土铁路运动，首先解决钢铁、煤炭、木材等厂矿运输和短途运输问题的方针。从此，大办土铁路的群众运动就蓬蓬勃勃地开展了起来。广大群众在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，破除了迷信，解放了思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，以冲天的干劲，战胜了一切困难，迅速形成了大办土铁路的高潮。从去年11月到今年3月20日不到五个月的时间，全省已经建成的土铁路达到七百七十八公里，制造机车六十八台（其中蒸汽机车十六台），制造车辆一万一千五百多辆（包括手推铁轨车）。目前正在施工的线路还有五十八条，全长五百八十点二公里。已经建成和正在修建的土铁路合计一千三百五十八点二公里，相当于我省境内现有洋铁路总长的一半。在大搞土铁路中培养了大批的技术人员。由于这些土铁路的建成，使许多地方从肩挑人抬、人推马拉的运输方式，一跃而为机械化、半机械化的运输方式。大办土铁路，不仅可以解决重点钢铁、煤炭、木材等生产基地的短途运输问题，而且能够大大提高生产力，降低企业成本，促进技术革新和技术革命运动的发展和生产面貌的改变，从而保证工农业生产的大跃进。河南省在五个月的时间内，修建的七百七十八公里的土铁路，每日运输量可增加四万吨左右，可代替汽车五百一十八辆，或代替马车四千辆左右、架子车二万辆左右。一年大约可以节省三万五千个作常年运输工作的劳动力，节约运费三千四百七十三万元。效果是十分显著的。这是党的总路线和“两条腿走路”方针的胜利，是社会主义建设群众运动的胜利。
    解放以来，国家进行的铁路建设获得了飞跃的发展。但是，目前还不能满足日益增长的运输需要。大办土铁路是解决短途运输问题的重要措施，它的优点很多，概括起来，有以下几个方面：
    兴办土铁路有三大优点
    一、投资少，取材易。在平原修建土铁路，每公里投资一般只要五万元左右，只占洋铁路投资的七分之一。在材料上可以就地取材，容易解决。修建洋铁路每公里需要钢材一百三十吨，木材三百二十立方米，而修建土铁路每公里只需要白生铁八十吨，木材六十五立方米。在动力上也容易解决，用蒸汽机车或汽车改装都可以，在无机车的情况下人推马拉也行，同样可以提高效率。
    二、效率高，运费低。例如济源至克井土铁路，用汽车改装的机车效率比汽车提高十倍至十五倍；武陟至詹店土铁路，用汽车改装的机车效率提高五十倍。由于效率高，相对地降低了运价，节约了大批人力、畜力和运输工具。济源至克井土铁路每吨公里运价暂定一角五分，比汽车运价降低490％，比马车运价降低233％，比手推车运价降低500％。同时能够代替马车八十九部，或手推车五百三十二部，可以节省一百到五百人（按马车和手推车计算）。焦作几个钢铁厂实现轨道化后，抽出劳力四千二百多人支援了农业生产和工业生产，效果很好。
    三、可以自力更生全民举办。由于投资少，取材易，设备容易解决，凡有条件的地区和厂矿，都可以自力更生地全民性地举办。因为效率高，运费低，可以解放大批劳动力，全民办的积极性就更高，有广泛的群众基础，可以大大加快建设速度。
    总之，兴办土铁路具有投资少、取材易、效率高、运费低、全民办、速度快等等优点，能够很好地解决短途运输问题。因此，它是迅速加强交通运输薄弱环节的一项重要措施，是完全符合多快好省的精神的。
        用满腔热情支持这个新生事物
    在几个月来的大办土铁路运动中，我们深深地体会到：要高速度地兴办土铁路，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，克服右倾保守思想。土铁路是一个新生事物，各级领导都采取了同对待其他新事物一样的态度，满腔热情地、主动积极地支持和扶植它的发展。但是，也有少数人不相信群众，看不到群众的力量，认为
  “群众的干劲再大，没有钢轨，没有工具，没有技术，也办不成”，有的说什么“小铁轨解决不了大问题”。在解决了土铁路能不能办的问题之后，有的同志又眼睛向上，强调困难，伸手要投资、要材料、要设备，不依靠群众自力更生去克服困难，而是干劲不足，迟迟不前；也有的同志有喜洋厌土思想，消极等待，结果洋的等不来，土的也搞不成。对于这些思想，必须认真地不断地进行教育加以克服，才能保证土铁路建设运动的顺利开展。
    经验证明：大办土铁路必须贯彻执行土洋并举、先土后洋“两条腿走路”的方针。要因地制宜，因陋就简，采取机车牵引、人推马拉等多种多样的办法，先土法上马然后再逐步提高。只有如此，才能使土铁路的建设搞得多快好省。
    经验证明：大办土铁路，必须抓住重点，先重点后一般，先短后长，有计划有步骤地建设。首先解决厂矿内部运输和钢铁矿山、煤矿、木材的短途集运，以适应当前的迫切需要。然后逐步地解决一般物资的短途运输和建设较长的线路。
    经验证明：大办土铁路必须采取自力更生、全民举办，以专市县、厂矿企业和人民公社举办为主、省帮助为辅的方针。有省投资举办的、专区投资举办的、县投资举办的，也有县社合办、企业自筹资金举办、民办公助、集资合办的，这样就充分地发挥了各个方面的积极性。在保证完成国家生产和调运计划的前提下，没有生铁自己炼，没有木材自己伐，没有资金自己筹，不懂技术自己学，许多地方不向国家要一斤铁、一斤钢，完全靠自力更生办起了土铁路。如新乡专区开展了十万人的炼铁运动，为大办土铁路炼出大量的铁，同时还采取了公社出劳力、大家筹集资金和献铁献料等办法。因而克服了困难，加快了建设速度，迅速出现了全民大办土铁路的高潮。
    1960年，我省国民经济持续跃进的形势，要求我们更好地解决运输问题。为了抓紧突破交通运输这个薄弱环节，适应大跃进形势的急迫需要，我们决心把全民大办土铁路的群众运动，推向新的更大的高潮。初步计划在今年内修建比较长的土铁路二十三条，总长六百三十公里，重点解决钢铁矿山、煤矿、森林基地和大型水利工地等短途运输问题，大搞厂矿企业内部和田间的轨道化，大力解决重点物资与铁路、公路、码头之间的接口对缝问题。大抓土铁路的成套工作，使土铁路和机车车辆等配起套来，并且加强运输经营管理，以便充分发挥土铁路的作用和潜力，促进工农业生产的发展。
    以上发言，如有不妥之处，请各位代表指正。（附图片）
