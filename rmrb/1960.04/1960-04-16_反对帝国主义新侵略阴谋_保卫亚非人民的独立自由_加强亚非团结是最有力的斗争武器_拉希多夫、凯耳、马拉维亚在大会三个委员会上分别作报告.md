Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 14th: Rashidov, the Soviet secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, delivered a report on cultural exchange and cooperation at the meeting of the Third Committee (Cultural and Social Committee) of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

　　Rashidov, in reviewing the growing cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries, said that it was precisely because of the great victories achieved in the heroic struggle of the Asian and African people for freedom and independence that all these achievements could be made.

　　He said that the despicable colonial system is doomed to die, and now it is rapidly heading towards death. Long-term colonial rule has hindered the cultural development of Asian and African countries. He said that the people of Asian and African countries are now faced with the great task of eliminating all the ugly features of colonialism in the cultural field, thereby restoring national culture.

　　He pointed out that the normal development of national culture is only possible under the following conditions: establishing sovereign governments that help promote cultural development, inheriting cultural traditions, and utilizing cultural heritage as the basis for further developing culture and expanding cultural exchanges between countries.

　　Rashidov emphasized that people should not think that this progressive development in cultural relations will always proceed smoothly. The imperialist groups in some Western countries, keen on maintaining international tension, are doing everything possible to divide the people of Asian and African countries. Therefore, he called on the people of Asian and African countries to further strengthen their solidarity to defeat the conspiracies of imperialism.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 14th: John Keer, the Ugandan secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, delivered a report on consolidating and expanding the Asian-African solidarity movement at the meeting of the First Committee (Political Committee) of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

　　He emphasized that the solidarity of the people of Asian and African countries is our most powerful weapon against colonialism and imperialism. He said that the imperialists' plunder of our two continents has united the people of Asian and African countries against a system composed of deception and plunder.

　　When talking about the solidarity movement in Asia and Africa, he said that the Bandung Conference was the cradle of the Asian-African solidarity movement. The maintenance of the Bandung principles by the governments and people of Asian and African countries in all aspects of activities in the Asian-African world is fundamentally strengthening our solidarity movement. He said that since the Bandung Conference, the friendly ties and determination for cooperation between the people of Asian and African countries have been increasing day by day. He condemned the imperialists for trying every possible means to undermine and divide the solidarity of Asian and African countries. He said, "The imperialists have created the most vicious conspiracies to divide the solidarity movement of Asian and African countries. Therefore, we, the people of Asian and African countries, must unite our ranks against the conspiracies of imperialism. We must support each other's just cause, and we must mobilize all our forces to strive for and defend our national independence. No force can stop the people of Asian and African countries from realizing their wishes."

　　Keer also pointed out that the differences in political, economic, and social structures between Asian and African countries "are not opposed to our solidarity. On the contrary, this further proves the strength of our movement and shows the seriousness and sincerity of our goals."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 14th: Malaviya, the Indian secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, delivered a report on the economic development of Asian and African countries at the meeting of the Second Committee (Economic Committee) of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. He pointed out that in the past two years since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Cairo, Asian and African countries have made progress economically. He said, but because of the appalling devastation and plunder of Asian and African countries by the imperialists, despite the efforts made, the bleak picture of colonial poverty still damages our beautiful land.

　　He said that in many independent countries in Asia and Africa, imperialism still firmly controls the economy. He said that in the world market, Western countries are able to maintain the prices of their commodities, and even illegally raise prices. Therefore, the income from exports of Asian and African countries is reduced, while they have to pay more for imported goods.

　　He condemned the threat of the European "Common Market" and the European Economic Community to the economies of Asian and African countries, and demanded the abolition of all discrimination against Asian and African countries in trade, and the stabilization of prices in the world market. He said that the rapidly developing new type of relationship between Asian and African countries is a source of strength and confidence for us, and helps us to achieve the task of economic independence.

　　When talking about neo-colonialism, he said that imperialist countries have discovered that it is impossible to rule their colonies in the old way and continue to use them as appendages to the economy of the imperialist homeland, so they are trying to maintain the old situation in new ways and forms. He pointed out that the purpose behind the imperialist "aid" plan seems to be to continue to control our Asian and African countries and prevent our real industrialization.

　　He pointed out that in many cases, this "aid" is attached with political and military conditions, which lead to interference in the internal affairs of the countries receiving the aid. He also said that in many cases, this "aid" takes the form of providing weapons and other military equipment, which can only hinder but not promote the development of the national economy of these countries.

    反对帝国主义新侵略阴谋　保卫亚非人民的独立自由
    加强亚非团结是最有力的斗争武器
    拉希多夫、凯耳、马拉维亚在大会三个委员会上分别作报告
    新华社科纳克里14日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处苏联书记拉希多夫在第二届亚非人民团结大会第三委员会（文化和社会委员会）会议上作了关于文化交流和合作问题的报告。
    拉希多夫在回顾亚非国家日益发展的文化交流时说，正是由于亚非各国人民争取自由和独立的英勇斗争取得了伟大的胜利，因此才能取得这一切成就。
    他说，可耻的殖民主义制度注定要死亡，现在它正在很快地走向死亡。长期的殖民统治阻碍了亚非国家的文化发展。他说，亚非各国人民现在面临着肃清殖民主义在文化领域内的一切丑恶特征从而恢复民族文化的巨大任务。
    他指出，正常发展民族文化只有在下列条件下才有可能：建立帮助促进文化发展的拥有主权的政府，继承文化传统，并且利用文化遗产，作为进一步发展文化和扩大各国人民之间文化交流的基础。
    拉希多夫强调说，人们不应该认为，文化关系方面的这种进步发展总是会顺利地进行的。热衷于保持国际紧张局势的一些西方国家的帝国主义集团正在千方百计地分裂亚非各国人民。因此，他要求亚非各国人民进一步加强他们的团结以击败帝国主义的阴谋。
    新华社科纳克里14日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处乌干达书记约翰·凯耳在第二届亚非人民团结大会第一委员会（政治委员会）会议上作了关于巩固和扩大亚非团结运动的报告。
    他强调说，亚非各国人民的团结是我们反对殖民主义和帝国主义最有力的武器。他说，帝国主义者对我们两大洲的掠夺已经使得亚非各国人民团结起来，反对由欺骗、掠夺所构成的制度。
    他在谈到亚、非两洲的团结运动时说，万隆会议是亚非团结运动的摇篮。亚非国家政府和人民在亚非世界各方面的活动中维护万隆原则是从根本上加强我们的团结运动。他说，自从万隆会议以来，亚非各国人民之间的友谊联系和合作的决心日益增强。他谴责帝国主义者千方百计地破坏和分裂亚非国家的团结。他说，“帝国主义者制造了最恶毒的阴谋来分裂亚非国家的团结运动。因此，我们，亚非各国的人民，必须团结我们的队伍反对帝国主义的阴谋。我们必须相互支持我们的正义事业，我们必须动员一切力量努力取得并保卫我们的民族独立。没有任何力量能够阻止亚非各国人民实现他们的愿望”。
    凯耳还指出，亚非国家之间的政治、经济和社会结构的不同；“跟我们的团结并不是对立的。恰恰相反，这进一步证明了我们运动的力量，表明了我们目标的认真和诚挚”。
    新华社科纳克里14日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处印度书记马拉维亚在第二届亚非人民团结大会第二委员会（经济委员会）会议上作了关于亚非国家经济发展问题的报告。他指出，自第一届亚非人民团结大会在开罗举行会议以来的过去两年中，亚非国家在经济上取得了进展。他说，可是由于帝国主义者对亚非国家进行了骇人听闻的摧残和掠夺，因此尽管作出了努力，殖民地贫困的黯淡情景仍然损害着我们美好的国土。
    他说，在亚非两洲的许多独立国家中，帝国主义仍然牢牢地控制着经济。他说，在世界市场上，西方国家能够维持它们的商品的价格，甚至非法抬高价格。因此，亚非国家出口商品的所得减少，而对进口的商品不得不付出更多的钱。
    他谴责欧洲“共同市场”和欧洲经济集团对亚非国家经济的威胁，并要求废除在贸易方面对亚非国家的一切歧视，并稳定世界市场的价格。他说，亚非国家之间迅速发展的新型关系是使我们有力量和有信心的源泉，并且有助于我们实现经济独立的任务。
    他在谈到新殖民主义时说，帝国主义国家发觉不可能用老办法来统治他们的殖民地并继续把它们作为帝国主义本国经济的附属品，因此企图改用新的方式和形式来维持旧的局面。他指出，帝国主义“援助”计划背后的目的看来是继续控制我们亚非国家和阻止我们真正工业化。
    他指出，在许多情况下，这种“援助”是附有政治和军事条件的，这些条件导致对接受援助的国家的内政的干涉。他还说，在许多情况下，这种“援助”采取了提供武器和其它军事装备的形式，这只能阻碍而不能促进这些国家民族经济的发展。
