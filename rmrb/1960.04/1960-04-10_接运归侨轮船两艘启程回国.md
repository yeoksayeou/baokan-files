Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 8th: The "Russia," one of the two ships sent by the Chinese government to pick up displaced overseas Chinese, left Jakarta on the evening of the 7th with more than 1,440 compatriots on board, returning to China.

Among the overseas Chinese returning home by ship, more than 600 were from Cirebon, Majalengka, Ciamis, and Sukabumi in West Java, and more than 800 were impoverished overseas Chinese in Jakarta and those who had drifted to Jakarta. To date, more than 7,700 overseas Chinese from West Java have been transported back to China by three batches of ships sent by the Chinese government. Nearly 2,000 overseas Chinese have completed the formalities and are waiting to return home.

Last night, Li Jusheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and Consul General in Jakarta, Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative participating in the Joint Committee for the implementation of the treaty between China and Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality, and other staff members of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General braved the heavy rain to see them off at the port. The overseas Chinese in Jakarta also braved the heavy rain and stood on the pier to bid farewell to their returning compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 8th: The "Da Baokang," a ship sent by the Chinese government to West Kalimantan, Indonesia, to pick up the second batch of returning overseas Chinese there, left Singkawang on the afternoon of the 7th with 699 overseas Chinese who had suffered from a fire, returning to China.

These overseas Chinese have gone bankrupt due to the impact of the Indonesian authorities' ban on foreign small vendors and the occurrence of the fire.

Another ship, the "Hai Huang," which is carrying overseas Chinese from West Kalimantan back to China, is scheduled to leave Singkawang around the 11th.

A major fire occurred in Bengkayang, the commercial center of West Kalimantan, on February 2nd. After the fire, 5,000 overseas Chinese were displaced and homeless.
