Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 2nd – A novel scene of white sails dotting the roads of Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province – "land sailing vessels" – has emerged. This is a flower of technical innovation from transport workers. More than 300 horse-drawn carts and 400 handcarts throughout the city have been fitted with sails. The city's horse-drawn carts and handcarts are now preparing to fully implement sail power.

　　The "land sailing vessel" method was created by workers in the Longsha Transportation Management Area of ​​the city based on the principle of sailing ships. Installing sails on horse-drawn carts, under conditions of level 3 to 4 winds, can increase the load by 20% to 30% and accelerate the speed of travel. The construction of this type of sail is very simple: a bamboo pole is erected at the front of the cart, and a piece of white cloth two meters long and one and a half meters wide (which can be appropriately increased or decreased according to the size of the cart) is placed with two bamboo poles horizontally at each end to make something like a sail. When there is wind, it is raised, and when there is no wind, it is lowered. Except in headwind conditions, this cloth sail can borrow wind power from all directions. Usually, after two-horse drawn rubber-wheeled carts use sails, the load capacity remains unchanged, and only one horse is needed to pull them. Especially when pulling up slopes, before installing the cloth sail, the animals were often covered in sweat from exhaustion; after installing the sail, in level 3 or 4 winds, the animals can pull the cart up without much effort. The effect of installing this type of sail on handcarts is also very significant. Handcarts that require four people to push uphill only need one person in strong winds.

　　Sail carts are more suitable in rural areas and suburbs where the wind is strong. After promotion, they can greatly increase rural transportation capacity.

    陆地行舟
    新华社哈尔滨2日电　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市的马路上，出现了白帆点点“陆地行舟”的新奇景象。这是运输工人技术革新的花朵。全市有三百多辆马车和四百多辆手推车装上了风帆。全市的马车和手推车最近准备全部实行风帆化。
      “陆地行舟”的办法，是这个市龙纱运输管理区的工人根据帆船的原理创造的。马车上安装风帆，在三级到四级风的条件下，能增加载量20％到30％，并加快了行车速度。这种风帆的做法很简单，在车的前部立上一根竹竿，用一块两米长、一米五宽的白布（可根据车的大小适当增减），两端横上两根竹竿，做一个像船帆的东西，有风时就拉起来，无风时就落下来。除了顶风的情况外，这个布帆可借各个方向的风力。平时两匹马拉的胶轮车使上风帆以后，载重量不变，只要一匹马就可以拉动。特别是拉坡道时，没有安装布帆以前，往往牲畜累的满身是汗；安上风帆以后，在三、四级风时牲畜不费劲就拉过去了。这种风帆安装手推车上效果也很显著，需要四个人才能推上坡的手推车，在风力大的情况下，只需一个人就够了。
    风帆车在风力较大的农村和市郊更为适宜，推广后可大大增加农村运输力量。
