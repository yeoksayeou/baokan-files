    The Endless Joy of the Canteen
    Zhang Weiguo, Secretary of the CPC Pingjiang County Committee, Hunan Province

    It was during the warm spring blossoming season that I and comrades from the work team went to the Daizhu Brigade in this deep mountain valley.

    The road goes directly to Daizhu Brigade. After getting out of the car, the old farmers raising seedlings and the young men transporting fertilizer greeted us with smiles all over their faces. On both sides of the creek, peach blossoms were red, willows were green, and azaleas covered the mountains, making the mountain valley crimson. The spring breeze gently carried the sound of mountain songs:

    Sing about the canteen in March,
    Sing with joy in our hearts;
    The canteen's red surpasses the azalea,
    We live in paradise;
    Eating well and dressing warmly,
    Heroes on the fertilizer transport front;
    Raising seedlings like nurturing infants,
    Striving to win the first merit in increased production!

    In the terraced fields in the distance, the girls turning the paddy fields sang even more melodious songs:

    The Communist Party is like our parents,
    Communism is paradise.
    Collectivization is the bridge,
    The public canteen brings great liberation.
    Putting down the fire poker to go to the battlefield,
    Hearts blooming, we engage in production,
    Striving to be stronger than men!

    All of this dispelled our travel fatigue. At this time, the cook of the Zhongjianwu Canteen, wearing a white apron, waved to us with a face full of spring breeze.

    The Zhongjianwu Canteen is a "Ten-Good" (Note 1) canteen. How beautifully it is decorated! The snow-white walls are covered with poems and paintings, dazzling to the eye. In front of the canteen, the commune members used vigorous strokes to write these two couplets:

    One is: Listen to Chairman Mao,
            Follow the Communist Party.

    The other is: The canteen skillfully cooks meals for thousands of families,
            The commune warms the hearts of ten thousand people.

    The kitchenware of this canteen has been completely renovated. Sweet spring water flows through earthen tap water pipes into water tanks and pots; it also sends hot water to the bathroom and washing area through tap water pipes. The "Daizhu-style" three-purpose vegetable cutter can cut 500 catties of vegetables into shreds, slices, and bits in one hour, increasing efficiency by twenty-five times compared to manual labor. The "Daizhu-style" dishwashing machine can wash four bowls at a time. There are also mechanized manure carts, mechanized rice measuring, and so on. Outdated shoulder carrying and back-loading are now just jokes in people's idle conversations.

    Just inside the canteen is a small store, stocked with various local products, wild animal meat, tobacco, wine, pickles, preserved vegetables, chili peppers, fermented bean curd... In addition to being able to eat three dishes and a soup at each meal in the canteen, each commune member can also go to the canteen to get vegetables according to their own preferences for sour, salty, light, and spicy tastes, or go to the small store to buy vegetables. When relatives and guests come, the canteen's small stove will prepare satisfying meals for you. Patients, the elderly, postpartum women, or those who encounter weddings and funerals will also receive special care.

    Here, firewood and charcoal are abundant, and every family burns a roaring charcoal fire. The canteen prepares half a year's worth of firewood for each family. But don't think this canteen is extravagant; on the contrary, they run the canteen diligently and thriftily. In the past eight months, they have saved 3,150 catties of grain, an average of more than 35 catties per person. The canteen's chickens and ducks are in flocks, and the pigs and cattle are full in their pens. The money for oil and salt for daily expenses is earned by running small side businesses. The commune members have also used the surplus cash from the canteen's side businesses to purchase more than 20 kinds of medicines and set up a medical clinic.

    Recently, the commune members have also developed the canteen into a base for organizing mass production, life, culture, education, and recreation, becoming a combination of "three halls, five rooms, and six groups." The three halls are the canteen, classroom, and meeting hall; the five rooms are the study room, library, recreation room, barber shop, and bathroom; the six groups are the work group, nursery group, newspaper reading group, sanitation group, medical group, and sewing and laundry group. The four walls of the canteen's dining hall have become a sea of big-character posters, and competitions are in full swing. The study room is particularly elegant and quiet, with literate people teaching illiterate people, and those who know more teaching those who know less. Cadres often come to give political lessons. The library has more than 100 kinds of popular books such as agricultural technology, scientific knowledge, and "The Communist Party Member." The recreation room is equipped with more than 10 kinds of musical instruments such as the southern fiddle, erhu, sheng, xiao, and flute; there are also poker, chess, ball games... and so on.

    The warm big family has encouraged collective production, enriched collective life, and cultivated the new spirit of collectivism among the commune members. All ninety-two people in the canteen voluntarily moved to live around the canteen, building a new socialist village. 100% of the labor force is at work, and the efficiency of spring plowing production has increased by 172% compared to the same period last year. Poor peasant commune member Hu Yinde told us that his family has four children. Before joining the canteen, they did not go to school because of the heavy living burden; now they all wear blue khaki clothes and sneakers, and they are growing fat, obedient, and smart. Two who should be in school have their schoolbags on their backs. With tears of gratitude in his eyes, he said: "A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, nothing is better than the canteen run by the commune! I pray day and night, wishing Chairman Mao, our great benefactor, a long and healthy life!" Middle peasant commune member Hu Hanfan, who did not have a correct understanding of the canteen last year, said excitedly at this moment: "Now you can't get me out of the canteen, even if you beat me with a stick."

    In less than a year, twenty of the thirty-nine canteens in Daizhu Brigade have caught up with and surpassed the Zhongjianwu Canteen, and the rest are carrying out the "learn, catch up, and surpass" movement to ensure that they will fully achieve "Ten-Good" canteens in April and report the good news to Chairman Mao.

    Pingjiang, the red base area during the Great Revolution, from the towering Mufu Mountains to the quiet lower reaches of the Miluo River, from the site of the "Jiayi Massacre" to "Yuechitang," where hundreds of thousands of peasants stormed the city and killed the pseudo-county magistrate during the Great Revolution, walk through all forty-eight ravines (Note 2), and you can encounter canteens like Zhongjianwu along the way. By the end of March, 98% of the commune members in the county had joined the canteens. 62% of the 14,401 canteens have achieved "Ten-Good," 30% have achieved "Five-Good," and the remaining 8% of the canteens are also getting better and better. The canteen has become a big family for the commune members and a center for their political, economic, and cultural activities.

    All of this shows that the public canteen conforms to natural law and human feelings, and has unlimited prospects. The great revolutionary teacher Lenin said in June 1919 that public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens are specimens of communist seedlings. No matter how difficult the situation, with the support of the proletarian state power, the communist seedlings will not be stunted, but will surely grow vigorously and develop into complete communism. Precisely because of this, our public canteen has greatly accelerated socialist construction at the present stage, and in the future, as Lenin said, it will surely "grow vigorously and develop into complete communism!"

    (Note 1) "Ten-Good" means that cadres, party members and league members all participate in the canteen, the three types of people become leaders, management personnel are well-equipped; grain is planned and saved well; kitchenware and tableware are complete, and things are done diligently and thriftily; canteen production includes good sideline production; kitchenware innovation is good; the mass line is followed and democratic management is good; cleanliness and hygiene are good; learning and recreational activities are well combined; all kinds of personnel are well cared for and served; various systems are established and improved.

    (Note 2) Pingjiang is a mountainous area, and the county has forty-eight long mountain ravines. Each mountain ravine is as long as twenty li or even more than one hundred li. Both sides of the mountain ravine are high mountains and ridges, with overlapping peaks. The high mountains on both sides are very close, forming a mountain cave, so the masses call it a "ravine."

### 食堂之乐乐无穷

    食堂之乐乐无穷
    中共湖南平江县委书记　张维国
    正是春暖花开的时候，我和工作组的同志到这个深山峡谷里的稻竹大队去。
    公路直通到稻竹大队。下车后，育秧的老农和运肥的小伙子们，堆着满脸笑容，迎接了我们。溪河两岸，桃红柳绿，漫山遍野的杜鹃花把山冲映得绯红；春风徐徐，送来了阵阵的山歌声：
    阳春三月唱食堂，
    唱得心里乐洋洋；
    食堂之红赛杜鹃，
    我们住在天堂中；
    吃得饱来穿得暖，
    运肥战线逞英雄；
    育秧好比育婴儿，
    要夺增产第一功！
    在远处阶梯式的水田中，翻凼的姑娘们唱出了更悦耳的歌声：
    共产党，像爹娘，
    共产主义是天堂。
    公社化，是桥梁，
    公共食堂大解放。
    丢掉火杈上战场，
    心花怒放闹生产，
    要与男子比高强！
    这一切，送走了我们旅途的疲乏。这时候，系着白围裙的中间屋食堂的炊事员，满脸春风地向我们招手。
    中间屋食堂是一个“十好”（注一）食堂。它打扮得多么漂亮！雪白的墙上，满壁诗画，琳琅耀目。食堂门前，社员们用雄健的笔姿，写着这样两副对联：
    一副是：听毛主席话，
            跟共产党走。
    一副是：食堂巧煮千家饭，
            公社温暖万人心。
    这个食堂的炊具成套地进行了革新。津甜的泉水经过土自来水管，流向水缸、锅内；又通过自来水管，把热水送到浴室和洗脸处。“稻竹式”三用切菜机，一个小时能分别将五百斤菜切成菜丝、菜片、菜屑，比人工提高工效二十五倍。“稻竹式”洗碗机，一次可以洗四只碗。还有运粪车子化、量米机器化，等等。过了时的肩挑背荷，如今只是人们闲谈的笑料了。
    一进食堂就是小卖部，备有各种土产、野兽肉、烟酒、腌菜、酱菜、辣椒、霉豆腐……。每个社员除开每餐在食堂能吃到三菜一汤外，还能按照各自的酸咸淡辣的喜好到食堂去领菜，或到小卖部去买菜。亲戚客人来了，食堂的小灶，便会为你准备心满意足的饭菜。病人、老者、产妇或遇上婚丧喜事，又还会得到特殊的照顾。
    这里柴炭充裕，家家燃着熊熊的炭火，食堂为各家准备了半年的烧柴。可是你别以为这食堂奢侈，相反的，他们是勤俭办食堂，八个月来，节余了三千一百五十斤粮食，平均每人节余三十五斤多。食堂所有的鸡鸭成群，猪牛满圈，平日开支的油盐钱都是自己经营小副业挣来的。社员们还用食堂副业现金的积余，添置了二十多种药品，开办了医疗室。
    最近，社员们又把食堂发展成为组织群众生产、生活、文化、教育、文娱的基地，成了“三堂、五室、六组”相结合的所在。三堂是食堂、课堂、会堂；五室是学习室、图书室、文娱室、理发室、浴室；六组是作业组、托儿组、读报组、卫生组、医疗组、缝补洗衣组。食堂餐厅的四壁成了大字报的海洋，评比竞赛热火朝天。学习室内格外雅致清静，识字的教不识字的，认得多的教认得少的，经常有干部巡回来上政治课。图书室内有农业技术、科学知识、“共产党员”等一百多种通俗图书。文娱室内摆着南胡、二胡、笙箫、管笛等十多种乐器；还有扑克、象棋、球类……等。
    温暖的大家庭鼓舞了集体生产，丰富了集体生活，培养了社员们集体主义的新精神。全食堂九十二个人自愿迁住到食堂周围，建成了社会主义的新村庄；百分之百的劳力出勤，春耕生产的工效比去年同时期增长了172％。贫农社员胡银德告诉我们：他家四个小孩，在参加食堂以前，因为生活负担重，都没有读书；现在都穿上了蓝卡其布衣和球鞋，长得又胖又乖又聪明，两个应入学的都背上了书包。他含着满眶感激的泪花说：“千般好，万般好，哪有公社办的食堂好！我日祝夜拜，祝毛主席大恩人万寿无疆，长生不老！”去年对食堂认识不够正确的中农社员胡汉凡，这会儿也激动地说：“现在用棍子打我，也不出食堂了。”
    不到一年，稻竹大队的三十九个食堂，已经有二十个赶上和超过了中间屋食堂，其余的正在开展“学、赶、赛”的运动，保证在4月份全面实现“十好”食堂，向毛主席报喜。
    平江，大革命时期的红色根据地，从耸入云霄的幕阜大山到静静的汨罗江下游，从“加义惨案”的发生地到大革命时期数十万农民扑城杀死伪县长的“月池塘”，走遍四十八洞（注二），你一路都可以碰到像中间屋这样的食堂。到3月底止，全县98％的社员，都参加了食堂。一万四百零一个食堂，实现了“十好”的占62％，“五好”的占30％，其余8％的食堂也都越办越好。食堂已经成为社员的一个大家庭，已经成为社员政治、经济、文化活动的中心。
    所有这一切，说明了公共食堂顺乎天理，应乎人情，前途无量。伟大的革命导师列宁在1919年6月说过，公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园是共产主义幼苗的标本。不管情况是怎样困难，在无产阶级国家政权的支持下，共产主义的幼芽不会夭折，而定会茁壮地成长起来，发展成为完全的共产主义。正是这样，我们的公共食堂在现阶段，它已经大大加速了社会主义建设，而在将来，正如列宁所说的，一定会“茁壮地成长起来，发展成为完全的共产主义！”
    （注一）“十好”是干部、党团员都参加食堂，三部分人当领导，管理人员配备好；计划用粮，节约用粮好；炊具、食具齐全，勤俭办事好；食堂生产包括副业生产好；炊具革新好；走群众路线，民主管理好；清洁卫生好；学习娱乐活动结合好；各种人员照顾服侍好；各项制度建立健全好。
    （注二）平江是一个山区，全县有四十八个较长的山冲，每个山冲长达二十华里，甚至百余里以上，山冲两边都是高山峻岭，峦峰叠叠，两边高山相距很近，形成一个山洞，故群众叫它为“洞”。
