Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th -- TASS reported: In a note from the Soviet Foreign Ministry to the British Embassy in Moscow, the Soviet government stated that it hopes the British government will reconsider its views and agree that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina should require the Laotian government to abide by the Geneva Accords in its treatment of former Pathet Lao participants and to resume cooperation with the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

The Soviet note stated that the arguments put forward by the British government to justify its position are inconsistent with the obligation of the two chairmen to strive to implement the Geneva Accords—the foundation for peace and security in Laos.

The note pointed out that the current Laotian authorities' imprisonment of leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and their massive suppression of supporters to achieve their own favorable results in the National Assembly elections cannot but be regarded as another serious violation of the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements. This will inevitably lead to a sharpening of the Laotian situation and an aggravation of the tension in the entire Indochina region. The note went on to say that, in this situation, Britain's disagreement with the two chairmen taking joint action to ensure compliance with the Geneva Agreements on Laos is tantamount to directly encouraging and condoning a force in Laos that is taking discriminatory actions against former Pathet Lao participants in this election campaign, thereby further deepening the threat to peace and national unity in Laos and Indochina.

The note stated that the Soviet Union hopes that the two chairmen can act in unison and take measures to safeguard and strengthen peace in Laos on the basis of the Geneva Agreements.

    苏联外交部照会英国政府
    必须采取措施维护老挝和平
    英政府立场同日内瓦主席的义务不相符合
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：在苏联外交部给英国驻莫斯科大使馆的照会中说，苏联政府希望英国政府重新考虑自己观点并同意由印度支那问题日内瓦会议的两位主席要求老挝政府在对待前寮国运动参加者的态度上遵守日内瓦协议，恢复同老挝国际监察和监督委员会的合作。
    苏联的照会说，英国政府为论证自己的立场而举出的论据，是同两位主席应该力求实现日内瓦协议——老挝和平和安全的基础这一义务不相符合的。
    照会指出，目前的老挝当局监禁老挝爱国战线党的领袖并大肆镇压拥护他们的人，以便在国民议会选举中达到对自己有利的目的，这种做法不能不认为是又一次严重地破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，这将不可避免地导致老挝局势的尖锐化并加剧整个印度支那地区的紧张局势。照会接着说，在这种情况下，英国不同意关于两位主席共同行动使关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议得到遵守，这就等于直接鼓动和纵容老挝的这样一种势力，这种势力在这次竞选运动中对前寮国运动参加者采取歧视行动，因而更加加深了对老挝和印度支那的和平和民族团结的威胁。
    照会说，苏联希望两位主席能一致行动，在日内瓦协议的基础上采取措施维护和加强老挝的和平。
