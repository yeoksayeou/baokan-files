This Dispatch from Guangzhou, April 3rd: The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee recently instructed all areas of the province to take concrete measures to ensure that the large number of piglets born in April and May survive and thrive.

Based on the current pregnancy situation of sows, Guangdong Province will have five to six million piglets born in April and May. In order to ensure that these newborn piglets survive and thrive, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee have decided to take five measures throughout the province:

One: Select a certain number of outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists to take charge of the care of sows and piglets.

Two: In order to ensure the required concentrated feed for sows and their piglets, in addition to the feed grain originally retained by the people's communes, it has been decided to allocate 40 million jin of rice from the provincial grain reserves, directly to the pig farms, to be managed by the farm director for special use.

Three: While adhering to the principle of developing collective ownership at the production brigade level as the mainstay and actively developing pig farming at the commune level, attention should be paid to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties for pig farming, especially the enthusiasm of production teams and canteens. Therefore, about half of the piglets born in April and May, that is, two to three million heads, should be allocated to production teams and canteens for breeding. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for private pig farming by commune members' families.

Four: Seize the opportunity to solve the feed problem. In addition to the existing reclaimed land, it is necessary to sow miscellaneous grains and feed crops in a timely manner, and designate specialized teams to be responsible for management to ensure planting and harvesting. After spring plowing and rice transplanting, areas with relatively little reclaimed land should continue to organize forces to reclaim land and plant more miscellaneous grains and feed crops.

Five: The established pig farming plan for this year must be grasped firmly, thoroughly, specifically, and continuously. The Provincial Party Committee plans to organize three major inspections this year and hold three large-scale on-site meetings throughout the province. The Prefectural Party Committee should grasp it once every two months, and the County Party Committee should grasp it once every month. The County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committee should directly grasp it at the pig farms.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership in the pig farming industry. The province has established a professional pig farming team of 850,000 people, reclaimed 9.8 million mu of land, and planted 5 million mu of feed crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 3rd: Wangyue People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, which is famous throughout the country for pig farming, is actively preparing feed for pig farming in the off-season. Based on the plan to have 70,000 pigs in stock by the end of May, each pig will have an average of 900 jin of green fodder, ensuring a surplus in the off-season, and capable of storing more than 50 million jin.

By the end of February, the number of pigs in this commune had increased by 11,000 heads on the basis of 52,000 heads at the end of last year. According to the law of previous years, April and May are precisely the time when pig feed is scarce. At this time, the silage has been used up, aquatic feed is growing, and winter vegetables have been harvested. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee attaches great importance to feed production. In order to break through the feed off-season in April and May, the masses were widely mobilized, and the experience of solving the feed problem in the off-season in previous years was summarized, and six major measures of "cultivation, planting, harvesting, making, storing, and managing" were taken to produce a large amount of feed.

Cultivation: Focuses on the cultivation and management of feed and green manure planted in spring and winter. At the beginning of the vigorous plant growth season in spring, they identified and classified the 7,200 mu of green feed land plot by plot, applied fertilizer according to the seedlings, and required a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu. From the existing 36,000 mu of green manure, they selected 5,000 mu with better growth, divided them into fields according to one-fen of green manure per pig, inserted signs, and handed them over to the pig farm's feed production professional team for processing and cultivation.

Planting: Means planting fast-growing and high-yield feed. Spring buckwheat is a fast-growing and high-yield crop among local feeds. This spring, 473 mu have been planted in time, and it is expected that the yield per mu will reach 4,000 to 5,000 jin. Fully utilize the water surface to expand the planting of 5,500 mu of aquatic high-yield crops.

Harvesting: Means collecting wild feed. There are more than 300 kinds of wild grasses, tubers, and aquatic plants in this commune that can be used as feed, which can supplement 20% to 30% of green feed in the off-season.

Making: The commune's 42 non-staple food processing factories process by-products of Xiangfen noodles, tofu, wine, soy sauce, and grains as feed, which can increase by more than 2 million jin per month. In addition, dried and crushed wild chestnuts, rape stalks, and bean stalks are also nutritious good feed.

Storing: Means vigorously promoting silage. They are preparing to launch a "10,000-person silage" shock movement during the green manure harvesting period to store enough green feed for use in May and June.

Managing: Means strengthening the management of concentrated feed. A system of "special warehouse management, classified quantification, material requisitioning with a register, and periodic allocation" is implemented.

At the beginning of March, commune members launched a shock cultivation campaign, and 7,200 mu of feed land and 5,000 mu of green manure fields reserved for feed were generally top-dressed again.

    广东保证新生小猪全活全壮
    湖南望岳公社全面安排饲料生产作到淡月不淡
    本报广州3日电　中共广东省委和省人民委员会最近指示全省各地采取具体措施，保证4、5两月出生的大批小猪全活、全壮。
    根据目前母猪怀孕的情况，广东省在4、5两个月内，将有五、六百万头小猪出生。为了保证这些新生小猪全活、全壮，中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会决定在全省采取五项措施：
    一、挑选一定数量的优秀共产党员、共青团员和积极分子担当母猪和仔猪的护理工作。
    二、为确保母猪和所生小猪需要的精饲料，除各人民公社原来留用的饲料粮之外，决定从省粮食库存中拨出四千万斤稻谷，直接发到各个养猪场，由场长掌握，专粮专用。
    三、在坚持以发展生产大队一级所有为主和积极发展公社一级养猪业的同时，注意调动各方面的养猪积极性，尤其是生产小队和食堂的积极性。因此4、5月份生下的仔猪，应该将一半左右，即二、三百万头分配到小队和食堂饲养。社员家庭私人养猪也应注意适当安排。
    四、抓紧解决饲料问题。除现有已开荒地，必须适时播种杂粮和饲料作物，并确定专业队负责管理，保种保收外，全省在春耕插秧之后，开荒比较少的地区，还应继续组织力量开荒，多种植杂粮和饲料作物。
    五、今年既定的养猪计划，必须扎扎实实地抓，深入具体地抓，连续不断地抓。省委今年准备组织三次大检查，并召开三次全省性的大型现场会议。地委每两个月要抓一次，县委每一个月抓一次。县委和公社党委要直接抓到养猪场。
    各级党委已经加强了养猪业的领导，全省已经建立了八十五万人的养猪专业队伍，并开荒九百八十万亩，种下饲料作物五百万亩。
    本报长沙3日电　以养猪闻名全国的湖南省长沙县望岳人民公社，积极作好淡季养猪饲料准备，按5月底计划存栏猪七万头计算，平均每头有青饲料九百斤，做到淡季富裕，而且可贮备五千多万斤。
    到2月底止，这个公社的猪在去年底的五万二千头基础上，又增加一万一千头。根据历年规律，4、5月间正是猪饲料青黄不接的时候。这时青贮已经用完，水生饲料正在生长，冬种蔬菜已经收完，因此公社党委十分重视饲料生产。为了突破4、5两个月饲料淡季关，广泛发动群众，总结了历年解决淡季饲料问题的经验，采取“培、种、采、制、贮、管”六大措施，大量生产饲料。
    培：是大抓春冬种的饲料和绿肥的培育管理。他们在开春植物生长旺盛季节，对七千二百亩青饲料逐丘鉴定，分类排队，看苗追肥，要求亩产达万斤以上。他们从现有三万六千亩绿肥中，挑选生长较好的五千亩，按一头猪一分地的绿肥划到场，插上牌子，交猪场饲料生产专业队加工培育。
    种：就是种快速高产饲料。春荞是当地饲料中生长快、产量高的作物，今春已抢种四百七十三亩，预计亩产可达四、五千斤。充分利用水面，扩种五千五百亩水生高产作物。
    采：就是采集野生饲料。这个公社能做饲料的野草、块根、水生植物有三百多种，在淡季可以辅助20％至30％的青饲料。制：全社四十二座副食品加工厂，加工湘粉、豆腐、酒、酱、粮食的副产品做饲料，每月可以增加二百多万斤。另外，野栗子、油菜秆、豆类秆壳等焙干粉碎，也是有营养的好饲料。
    贮：就是大搞青贮。他们准备绿肥收割期间开展一次“万人青贮”的突击运动，贮足5、6月用的青饲料。
    管：就是加强精饲料的管理。实行“专仓保管，分类定量，凭册领料，定期拨付”的制度。
    3月初这个公社社员开展了一次突击培育运动，七千二百亩饲料地和五千亩留作饲料的绿肥田又普遍追肥一次。
