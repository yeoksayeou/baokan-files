Self-Remolding Through Participation in CPPCC Activities
Speech by CPPCC Member Zhu Dingqing

Chairman, fellow members:

I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 draft national budget, and I express my heartfelt support. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC and am willing to resolutely implement the new tasks mentioned in the three reports.

Participating in CPPCC activities allows one to contribute one's strength and is also conducive to self-remolding.

I would like to talk about some of my gains and experiences in the CPPCC activities in Hubei Province:

I am a former military and political personnel. Under the glorious light of the Party's united front policy, I have successively participated in the National Committee of the CPPCC and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC. In the past, I had a vague understanding of the role of the CPPCC. I always thought that the CPPCC had nothing to do, and participating in CPPCC activities was a burden. Because of this understanding, I not only failed to fulfill my due responsibility in mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism, but also suffered greatly in my self-remolding. In recent years, thanks to the Party's education and cultivation, and the promotion of the Great Leap Forward, especially because I have undertaken the specific tasks of the Hubei Provincial CPPCC working group and study group, I have gradually realized the important role of the People's Political Consultative Conference in our country's political life through work practice. It is an indispensable united front organization in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction period. Participating in CPPCC activities is also an effective way to implement the policy of combining remolding with service.

Over the past year, the First Working Group of the Hubei Provincial CPPCC, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, has assisted the Standing Committee in carrying out uninterrupted activities. In addition to the learning, visits, listening to reports, and literary writing arranged by the CPPCC as a whole, group activities were held on average more than twice a month. The content of the activities included symposiums on important current affairs policies, thematic discussions, and candid talks with each other on issues related to life, work, and ideology. The forms of activities are diverse, including large, medium, and small-scale forums, informal discussions, heart-to-heart talks, experience exchanges, and outings. Through these activities, relationships have been coordinated, unity has been enhanced, ideological obstacles have been cleared, political understanding has been improved, national policies and laws have been publicized, and mass opinions have been reflected. Many people call the CPPCC the home of democratic people and often yearn for CPPCC activities. These lively political work seemed difficult to get started with at first. But as we went deeper and more meticulously, we felt that it was very meaningful, and the more we did, the more we felt that there was no end to it, and the more we felt that it contained extremely rich nourishment for self-remolding. My past erroneous idea that the CPPCC had nothing to do and that participating in CPPCC activities was a burden has now been completely criticized by the facts.

Over the past year, the Hubei Provincial CPPCC Study Group, under the specific arrangement of the Study Committee, has made unremitting efforts in the study and remolding of democratic people from all walks of life and has achieved certain results. As far as my personal progress is concerned, it has indeed been of great help. I came out of the hospital at the end of 1958. At that time, my understanding of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune was very vague. When some specific issues touched on the reality of my own life, I even had some doubts and concerns. For example, I once regarded the General Line as a kind of call from the Party. The goals of the call were always grander and not necessarily completely achievable. I had doubts about the facts of the Great Leap Forward because of the temporary tension in market supply. I was worried about the People's Commune organization, first of all because I had to participate in collective life. My attitude towards socialism was obviously far from being in line with objective reality.

In the spring of 1959, I participated in the study of the Provincial CPPCC with a contradictory mood. After a year of continuous self-study and collective discussions, combined with listening to reports and thematic debates, I gradually realized in theory that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the inevitable trend of China's economic development and a strong pillar of China's socialist cause. Then, in coordination with the study, I visited factories, rural areas, the capital, and fraternal countries for multi-faceted visits, further clarifying that the entire landscape and social appearance of our country in the past two years have undergone amazing changes under the shining of the three great banners. More fortunately, in fraternal countries, I personally saw the strong unity and powerful strength of the socialist family, full of confidence in maintaining world peace and the future of human happiness. This made me deeply realize that our high-speed construction of socialism is not only the strong desire of the 650 million Chinese people, but also has great world historical significance. My past wrong views and ideas about the three great banners were entirely a concrete manifestation of my political stand and ideological feelings not truly aligning with the Party and the people. Living in the era of socialism, mountains are changing, waters are changing, everything is changing, and it is difficult to control one's own destiny if my subjective world cannot correctly reflect objective reality. In order to continue to promote the self-remolding of democratic people, the Provincial CPPCC held a self-remolding review and evaluation after the Spring Festival this year. In the process of review, I re-evaluated my political outlook and ideological status, and revised the self-remolding plan for breaking down capitalist ideology and establishing socialist ideology in the future.

From the above simple situation, it is fully proved that participating in CPPCC activities can not only contribute one's wisdom and strength, but also is extremely beneficial for self-remolding.

Every member of the united front should: both do a good job in their own business; and actively participate in CPPCC activities.

According to the five tasks proposed by the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC last year and this year, whether it is carrying out domestic and foreign unity; or publicizing national policies and laws, reflecting opinions, and making suggestions; or carrying out technical revolution, cultural revolution, and launching the movement to increase production and practice economy; or learning and labor training; or opposing domestic and foreign enemies and liberating Taiwan, they are all extremely glorious and arduous political tasks. They are all things that we should do and can do. The idea and saying that "only want to do a good job in the post and regard participating in CPPCC activities as trouble" is extremely wrong. This error not only abandons one's due responsibility, but also completely ignores the important role of the Party's united front policy at the present stage, and even cannot distinguish one's former path. I believe that as a member of the united front, if one truly understands the spiritual essence of the General Line and is willing to go all out, one should also implement the policy of walking on two legs. One leg is to do a good job in one's own business, and the other leg is to actively participate in CPPCC activities. As for those who do not hold specific jobs, they should especially be based on CPPCC activities. Take CPPCC activities as the basis for self-remolding; take self-remolding as the guarantee for doing a good job in CPPCC activities. Closely combine the relationship between remolding and service in CPPCC activities. As mentioned above, the activities of the CPPCC are all matters full of political and ideological significance, and one can exercise and improve one's position and point of view, as well as the mass line and the work method of seeking truth from facts, anytime and anywhere. For someone like me who has not been well-remolded and must undergo a long period of testing, I should fully exercise and improve my political level and policy level in such occasions. Of course, I have also considered that in the scope of CPPCC activities, the environment is relatively complex, and it is inevitable to produce some unexpected mistakes. But I have the confidence that as long as I dare to face my own mistakes, have the determination and courage to correct mistakes, learn from mistakes and draw lessons; closely rely on the leadership of the Party, and ask the Party for instructions and report at any time; consult with the masses on everything, and ask the masses for help and supervision. On the basis of the three-combination of leadership, masses, and self-consciousness, I will receive help and support in improving understanding and correcting mistakes. Flowers in greenhouses cannot withstand wind and frost. The passive style of being tied up and not daring to take responsibility boldly is extremely incompatible with the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and it is also extremely harmful to self-remolding.

Fellow members, the people of the whole country are now holding high the red flag of the General Line and advancing valiantly towards the grand goal of a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960 with vigorous steps. And there has been a good start. This situation is not only conducive to self-remolding, but also conducive to our contributing our strengths. I must, under the specific leadership of the Party, strive for a double harvest of remolding and service from CPPCC activities.

### 在参加政协活动中进行自我改造  朱鼎卿委员的发言

    在参加政协活动中进行自我改造
    朱鼎卿委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，表示衷心拥护。对陈叔通副主席所作的全国政协常务委员会的工作报告，表示完全同意。并愿为三个报告中所提示的新任务，坚决贯彻执行。
    参加政协活动可以贡献自己的力量，同时有利于自我改造
    下面我想谈谈我在湖北省政协活动中的一些收获和体会：
    我是一个旧军政人员，在党的统一战线政策光辉照耀下，先后参加了全国政协组织和湖北省政协组织。过去有一段时间，我对于政协的作用，是认识不清的。总以为政协无事可做，参加政协活动，是一种负担。由于这样的认识，因而我不仅是在调动一切积极因素、为社会主义服务方面，没有尽到自己应有的责任。对于自我改造，也受到莫大的损失。近年来，由于党的教育培养和大跃进形势的推动，更由于担任了湖北省政协工作组和学习组的具体任务，从工作实践中，逐步认识了人民政协在我们国家政治生活中的重要作用。它是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期不可缺少的一个统一战线组织。参加政协活动，对于贯彻执行改造与服务相结合的方针，同样是一种有效的途径。
    湖北省政协第一工作组，一年来，在秘书长的领导下，协助常委会，进行了不间断的活动。除了政协整个布置的学习、参观、听报告、文艺写作外，平均每月举行了两次以上的组务活动。活动的内容：包括重要时事政策座谈、专题讨论，以及对有关生活、工作、思想各方面的问题，相互畅谈。活动的形式是多种多样的。有大中小型座谈会、漫谈会、谈心会、经验交流会、郊游会等。通过这些活动，协调了关系，增进了团结，扫除了思想障碍，提高了政治认识，宣传了国家政策法令，反映了群众意见。不少的人，称政协为民主人士之家，经常向往着政协活动。这些生动活泼的政治工作，初做起来，似乎摸不着门径，无从下手。但深入细致的做下去，则感到意味深长，而且愈做愈感觉做不完，愈做愈觉得对于自我改造有着极其丰富的养料。我过去认为政协无事可做，参加政协活动，是一种负担的错误想法，现在完全为事实所批判了。
    湖北省政协学习组一年来在学委会的具体安排下对于各界民主人士的学习改造作了不懈怠的努力，并且取得了一定的成绩。就我个人的进步来说，的确有很大的帮助。我1958年底由病院出来，当时对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社的认识是很模糊的。对有些具体问题触及到本身生活实际，还发生某种程度的怀疑和顾虑。例如我曾把总路线看成是党的一种号召，号召的目标，总是远大些，不一定完全做得到。我对大跃进的事实，曾因市场一度供应紧张，产生过怀疑。我对人民公社组织，首先因为要参加集体生活，曾引起过顾虑。我这种对待社会主义的态度，很明显的，是与客观现实，远远不相适应的。
    1959年春，我怀着矛盾的心情，参加了省政协的学习，经过一年来不间断的自学和集体座谈，并结合听报告、专题辩论等步骤，在理性上，逐渐认识了总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国经济发展的必然趋势，是我国社会主义事业的有力支柱。接着配合学习，先后到工厂、到农村、到首都、到兄弟国家进行多方面的参观访问，更进一步的看清了我们国家近两年来整个山河面貌和社会面貌，都随着三大万岁的光芒照耀，发生了惊人的变化。更幸运的是：在兄弟国家里，亲眼看到社会主义大家庭的坚强团结，力量雄厚，对维护世界和平和人类幸福前途，都充满了信心。由此，使我深刻体会到，我们高速度的建设社会主义，不仅是六亿五千万中国人民的强烈愿望，而且具有重大的世界历史意义。我过去对三大万岁的错误看法和想法，完全是自己的政治立场和思想感情没有真正靠拢党和人民的具体表现。生活在社会主义的时代里，山在变、水在变、一切都在变，而我的主观世界，不能正确反映客观现实，是很难掌握自己的命运的。省政协为了继续推动民主人士的自我改造，于今年春节后举行了自我改造检查评比，我在检查过程中，对自己的政治面貌和思想状况，重新作了估价，并修定了今后破资立社的自我改造规划。
    从上述简单的情况中，充分证明参加政协活动，不仅是可以贡献自己的智慧和力量，而且对于自我改造是极其有利的。
    每个统一战线成员应该做到：既搞好本身业务；又积极参加政协活动
    根据全国政协常委会去年和今年所提示的五项任务，不管是进行国内外的团结也好；或者是宣传国家政策法令、反映意见、提出建议也好；或者是技术革命、文化革命、开展增产节约运动也好；或者是学习和劳动锻炼也好；或者是反对国内外敌人、解放台湾的斗争也好，都是极大光荣而艰巨的政治任务。也都是我们应该做和可能做的事情。那种“只图搞好岗位工作，把参加政协活动当成麻烦”的想法和说法，是极端错误的。这种错误不仅是放弃了自己应有的责任，而且根本忽视了党的统战政策在现阶段中的重大作用，甚至连自己从前的来路也辨别不清了。我认为作为一个统一战线下的成员，如果真正体会总路线的精神实质，愿意鼓足更大的干劲的话，也应该贯彻两条腿走路的方针，一条腿是把本身业务搞好，一条腿是积极参加政协活动。至如没有担任具体业务的人，尤其应该立足于政协活动。把政协活动作为自我改造的基础；把自我改造作为搞好政协活动的保证。把改造与服务两者的关系，紧密的结合在政协活动之中。如前所述，政协的活动，都是富有政治性、思想性的事情，随时随地都可以锻炼和提高自己的立场和观点、以及群众路线、实事求是的工作方法。对于一个没有改造好，而又必须经过长期考验的我来说，完全应该在这样的场合里，来锻炼和提高自己的政治水平和政策水平。当然，我也曾考虑到，在政协活动的范围里，环境比较复杂，难免不产生一些意外的错误。但我有信心，只要敢于正视自己的错误，有改正错误的决心和勇气，从错误中吸取经验和教训；紧紧的依靠党的领导，随时向党请示汇报；遇事与群众商量，要求群众帮助和监督。在领导、群众、自觉三结合的基础上，对于提高认识、改正错误，是会得到帮助和支持的。温室里的花朵是经不起风霜的。那种束手束脚、不敢大胆负责的被动作风，是与敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格极不相容的，而且对于自我改造，也是极有危害的。
    各位委员，当前全国人民正高举着总路线的红旗，以雄迈的步伐，朝着1960年更大更全面跃进的宏伟目标奋勇前进。而且已有良好的开端。这样的形势，既有利于自我改造，也有利于我们贡献所长，我一定要在党的具体领导下，从政协活动中，为争取改造与服务双丰收而努力奋斗。
