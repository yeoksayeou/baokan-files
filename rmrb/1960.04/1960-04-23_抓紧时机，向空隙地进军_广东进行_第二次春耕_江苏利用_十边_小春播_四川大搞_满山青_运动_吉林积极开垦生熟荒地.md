Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 21st: This year, the area sown with early rice and spring-sown miscellaneous grains in Guangdong has expanded by six to seven million mu compared to last year. However, because spring plowing and production started more than half a month earlier than last year, the planting plans for early rice and miscellaneous grains were basically completed in early April. Therefore, after completing the early rice transplanting ahead of schedule, Guangdong is vigorously reclaiming wasteland, intercropping, and expanding the area of spring-sown miscellaneous grains, while grasping the field management of early rice, and enthusiastically carrying out the "Second Spring Plowing."

After completing the spring-sown miscellaneous grain task on April 5th, Zhanjiang Prefecture is now organizing labor to rush to reclaim wasteland, making full use of every available space, and launching a mass movement of each person planting one, two, or five fen of miscellaneous grains. Shantou Prefecture has recently organized nearly one million wasteland reclamation troops, and in the past half month, they have newly reclaimed more than 440,000 mu of wasteland. Chenghai County, located in the Han River Delta with relatively little wasteland, is carrying out a comprehensive land utilization movement, making every effort to intercrop, interplant, replant, and utilize the land on the edges of fields, expanding the planting of miscellaneous grains and other crops to 70,000 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 21st: While planting large areas of spring-sown crops, Jiangsu Province is carrying out a magnificent "Small Spring Plowing" movement, mainly utilizing the vacant land on the edges of villages and roads, etc. As of the 18th, the province had planted more than 1.6 million mu of small miscellaneous grains, melons, vegetables, sesame, castor beans, sunflowers, and other crops on the vacant land on the "ten edges". Now, the "Small Spring Plowing" movement is continuing to develop in various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 21st: Various parts of Sichuan are applying the experience of increasing planting in the winter and small spring seasons, and are vigorously carrying out the "Greening the Mountains" planting movement in spring plowing and production.

In March, Wusheng, Nanchong and other counties used non-cultivated land to increase the planting of more than 270,000 jin of corn and sorghum seeds, and planted more than 170 million nests of melon and bean crops. These increased planting crops are all deeply ploughed and have sufficient fertilizer. Many places have also mobilized the masses to massively increase the planting of castor beans, sunflowers and other small oil crops. Jiangbei, Dazu, Bishan, Hechuan and other counties alone have planted more than 50 million castor bean plants. Under the slogan of "Everyone Lends a Hand, Using Every Available Space", Chongqing has planted more than 200 million sunflowers and 400,000 castor bean plants in a five-hour blitz.

At present, various places are continuing to carry out the "Greening the Mountains" planting movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 21st: A mass, large-scale movement to expand the cultivated area is being launched in various parts of Jilin in conjunction with spring sowing. Now, tens of thousands of people's commune members are reclaiming large areas of fertile virgin land and mature wasteland every day. According to incomplete statistics from Yushu, Dunhua, Lishu, Dehui, Yongji and other counties alone, more than 138,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed.

    抓紧时机，向空隙地进军
    广东进行“第二次春耕”　江苏利用“十边”小春播
    四川大搞“满山青”运动　吉林积极开垦生熟荒地
    据新华社广州21日电　今年广东播种的早稻面积和春种杂粮面积，都比去年扩大六、七百万亩；但由于春耕生产比去年提早半个多月，在4月上旬便基本完成了早稻和杂粮的种植计划。因此，广东各地在提早完成了早稻栽插之后，在抓紧早稻田间管理的同时，大力开垦荒地，间种套种，扩大春种杂粮面积，热烈地进行“第二次春耕”。
    湛江专区于4月5日完成了春种杂粮任务后，现在，各县都组织劳动力突击开荒，见缝插针，开展一人多种一分、二分、五分杂粮的群众运动。汕头专区最近组织了近百万开荒大军，半个月来新开垦荒地四十四万多亩。地处韩江三角洲、荒地较少的澄海县，开展综合利用土地运动，千方百计进行间种、套种、复种和利用五边地，把杂粮等作物扩种到七万亩。
    据新华社南京21日电　江苏省在种好大面积春播作物的同时，开展了一个规模壮阔的以利用村边、路边等“十边”隙地为主的“小春播”运动。到18日止，全省已在“十边”隙地上种植了小杂粮、瓜菜和芝麻、蓖麻、向日葵等作物一百六十多万亩。现在各地“小春播”运动正在继续发展。
    据新华社成都21日电　四川各地运用去冬小春增种经验，在春耕生产中，大搞“满山青”增种运动。
    武胜、南充等县在3月份即利用非耕地增种玉米、高粱种子二十七万多斤，并种瓜豆作物一亿七千多万窝，这些增种作物都做到深耕、肥足。许多地方还发动群众，大量增种蓖麻、向日葵等小油料作物。仅江北、大足、璧山、合川等县即已种植蓖麻五千多万株。重庆市在“人人动手，见缝插针”的口号下，突击五个小时，种植了向日葵二亿多株，蓖麻四十万株。
    目前各地仍在继续开展“满山青”增种运动。
    据新华社长春21日电　一个群众性的大规模的扩大耕地面积运动，正结合春耕播种在吉林各地展开。现在每天都有数以万计的人民公社社员在开垦大片肥沃的处女地和熟荒地。仅据榆树、敦化、梨树、德惠、永吉等县的不完全统计，已开垦荒地十三万八千多亩。
