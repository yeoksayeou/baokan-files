Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 22nd: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia today issued a statement commemorating the historic Bandung Conference.

The statement said that the development of the Asian-African situation in the five years since the Bandung Conference has demonstrated the continuous development and victory of the struggle against colonialism. The statement condemned the U.S. imperialists for trying every means to undermine the unity between Asian-African countries and socialist countries, and pointed out that the imperialist countries use modern revisionism as their tool. The revisionists attempt to drag some Asian-African countries, primarily India, the United Arab Republic, and Indonesia, into the so-called "Third Bloc."

The statement continued that the past five years since the Bandung Conference have clearly illustrated that there are only two paths on the issue of colonialism: either support or oppose. There is no third path. The only correct path is to abide by the anti-colonialist principles of the Bandung Conference, rather than choosing and organizing blocs. The only "bloc"—if there is one—is the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist bloc that includes all Asian-African countries.

The statement said that in recent years, the situation in Asia, especially in Africa, has shown the further development of the Bandung struggle. Imperialism can no longer maintain its rule and realize its evil schemes using old methods and old ways. In order to maintain their colonial rule, imperialism has had to adopt fascist forms. Imperialism directly or indirectly attempts to use this new method of so-called establishing "local military regimes" and making them serve as executors of imperialist policies. Through these local executors, imperialism implements its anti-communist policies to suppress democracy, prevent the people from developing their anti-colonialist struggle, and undermine national unity.

The statement condemned the racial discrimination crimes of the government of the Union of South Africa. The statement also condemned the Philippine government's attempt to turn its country into a U.S. nuclear weapons base. The statement pointed out that this measure taken by the Philippine government violates the Bandung resolutions and poses a great danger to the peace and security of Asia, especially the peace and security of Indonesia.

The statement called on Asian and African countries that respect the spirit of peace of Bandung to lodge a serious protest against the Philippines.

The statement concluded by saying that on the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, the Indonesian people should be more resolute and steadfast, and more decisively stop any direct or indirect attempts to betray the spirit and resolutions of Bandung.

The statement also expressed the hope that the Indonesian government will more faithfully and more earnestly implement all the resolutions of the Bandung Conference against colonialism and imperialism, in order to defend peace and respect democracy.

    印度尼西亚共产党发表声明纪念万隆会议五周年
    加强亚非国家团结　坚决反对殖民主义
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局今天发表声明，纪念具有历史意义的万隆会议。
    声明说，万隆会议以后的五年来，亚非形势的发展表明了反对殖民主义斗争的不断发展和胜利。声明谴责美帝国主义者想尽一切办法来破坏亚非国家和社会主义国家之间的团结，并且指出帝国主义国家利用现代修正主义来作为他们的工具。修正主义者企图把一些亚非国家，首先是印度、阿联和印度尼西亚，拖入所谓“第三集团”。
    声明接着说，事实上万隆会议以后五年来清楚地说明了，在对待殖民主义问题上，只有两条道路，要么支持，要么反对。第三条道路是不存在的。唯一正确的道路就是遵守万隆会议的反殖民主义原则，而不是选择和组织集团。唯一的“集团”——如果有的话——就是包括所有亚非国家的反殖民主义和反帝国主义的集团。
    声明说，近年来，亚洲的形势，特别是非洲的形势表明了万隆斗争的进一步的发展。帝国主义已经不能用老的办法和老方式来保持它们的统治和实现它们的罪恶阴谋。帝国主义为了保持它们的殖民统治，不得不采取法西斯主义的形式。帝国主义直接或间接地试图使用这种所谓建立“当地的军事政权”、并使它们充当帝国主义政策的执行者的新方法。帝国主义通过这些当地的执行者，执行它们的反共政策来镇压民主，不让人民发展他们的反殖民主义斗争，和破坏民族团结。
    声明谴责南非联邦政府的种族歧视罪行。声明还谴责菲律宾政府企图把它的国家变成美国核武器基地。声明指出，菲律宾政府采取的这个措施违反万隆决议而且使亚洲的和平和安全、首先是印度尼西亚的和平和安全遭到极大的危险。
    声明号召尊重万隆和平精神的亚非国家对菲律宾提出严重的抗议。
    声明最后说，在纪念万隆会议五周年的时候，印度尼西亚人民应当更加坚决和坚定，更加果断地制止要想背叛万隆精神和决议的任何直接或间接的企图。
    声明还希望，印度尼西亚政府更加忠实地和更加认真地执行万隆会议反对殖民主义和帝国主义的所有决议，以保卫和平和尊重民主。
