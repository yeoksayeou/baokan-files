Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 25th: Several newspapers in Rangoon today praised China's sincerity in the Sino-Indian talks and expressed hope that the talks would produce positive results.

    The "People's Daily" of Rangoon published an article entitled "Frank Talks in a Spirit of Mutual Concession," saying that as long as both sides are candid with each other, border disputes can be resolved fairly and reasonably. The article pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's strong desire for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue and his positive attitude have been warmly welcomed by public opinion in India and around the world.

    The article condemned the imperialists' attempts to sabotage the Sino-Indian talks, and pointed out that "a fair and reasonable resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue will not only benefit Sino-Indian friendly cooperation but also contribute to world peace. This will play a significant role in thwarting the imperialists' conspiracy."

    The newspaper concluded that peace-loving people in Asia and around the world hope that the Sino-Indian talks will produce good results.

    The "New Rangoon Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Background of the Sino-Indian Border Issue," stating, "The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex problem left over by British imperialism during its rule of India and its aggression against China. Therefore, the Sino-Indian border issue has been a long-standing dispute."

    The editorial pointed out, "The 2,000-kilometer-long Sino-Indian border has never been delimited. The Chinese government has always declared its hope to achieve a fair and reasonable resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute through friendly negotiations. Currently, Premier Zhou Enlai is holding talks with Prime Minister Nehru in India, and we sincerely hope that this meeting will produce good results."

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 23rd: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published a commentary today saying that Zhou Enlai's visit to India and the talks between the Chinese and Indian Premiers have become the focus of political opinion throughout Asia. The commentary pointed out that it is noteworthy that although extreme reactionary elements in India and their newspapers have been conducting anti-China activities for months, and have not ceased such activities until recently, broad public opinion in India sincerely welcomes the Chinese Premier's visit. Many newspapers have cited Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China and his remarks to Western reporters in Rangoon to prove the Chinese government's understanding attitude and sincere desire for a reasonable resolution of the dispute.

    The commentary said that the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi has received many letters from individuals and organizations expressing their hope for the success of the negotiations.

    The commentary said that China and India are the two largest and most populous countries in Asia, and the peaceful understanding between the two countries is a major factor for peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese side will do everything possible to resolve the border issue through this negotiation, and if the Indian side can also show the same sincerity, then the negotiation will be successful.

    匈牙利“人民自由报”说广大印度公众舆论真诚地欢迎中国总理的访问
    新华社仰光25日电　仰光几家报纸今天赞扬中国在中印会谈中的诚意，并且表示希望中印会谈产生积极的结果。
    仰光“人民报”以“本着互让的精神进行坦率会谈”为题发表的一篇文章说，只要双方开诚相见，边界争端是能够得到公平合理的解决的。文章指出，周恩来总理对和平解决中印边界问题所抱的强烈愿望和他的积极态度已经受到印度和全世界舆论的热烈欢迎。
    文章谴责了帝国主义者企图破坏中印会谈的阴谋，并且指出，“中印边界问题的公平合理的解决将不但有利于中印的友好合作，而且也有助于世界和平。这将在粉碎帝国主义者的阴谋方面起重大作用。”
    这家报纸最后说，亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人们都希望中印会谈产生良好的结果。
    “新仰光报”以“中印边界问题的背景”为题发表社论说，“中印边界问题是英帝国主义者在统治印度和对中国采取侵略行动的时期所遗留下来的一个复杂问题。因此，中印边界问题长期来存在纠纷。”
    社论指出，“长达两千公里的中印边界从来没有划定过。中国政府一向宣布希望通过友好谈判使中印边界争端得到公平合理的解决。目前周恩来总理正在印度同尼赫鲁总理举行会谈，我们热诚地希望这次会晤能产生良好的结果。”
    据新华社布达佩斯23日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天发表评论说，周恩来访问印度，中国总理和印度总理的会谈，成了整个亚洲政治舆论的中心。评论指出，值得注意的是，虽然印度极端反动分子及其报纸几个月来一直进行着反华活动，并且直到最近仍未停止这种活动，但是广大的印度公众舆论真诚地欢迎中国总理的访问。许多报纸都援引周恩来总理在中国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的报告和在仰光对西方记者的谈话，来证明中国政府所表示的谅解态度和合理解决争端问题的真诚愿望。
    评论说，中国驻新德里大使馆接到了很多私人和机关团体的来信，这些信件都表示了对谈判成功的愿望。
    评论说，中国和印度是亚洲两个最大的、人口众多的国家，两国的和平谅解是亚洲和平和世界和平的重大因素。中国方面将尽一切努力通过这次谈判解决边境问题，如果印度方面也能表现出同样的诚意，那么，谈判将会取得成效。
