The South African people, following the large-scale demonstration in Durban Harbor last June, have now launched a new high tide of struggle against the racial discrimination system centered on opposing the "Pass Laws." This struggle, which began with demonstrations in Vereeniging, has spread rapidly to the entire South Africa in just a few days, with unprecedented momentum and scale. In recent days, people in various parts of South Africa have held demonstrations and strikes, burned "Passes," and bravely resisted the armed suppression of the South African authorities with stones and sticks. On March 28, Africans, accounting for three-quarters of the population of the South African Federation, held a "Day of Mourning" to mourn their compatriots who were massacred by the white authorities. More than 90% of African workers across the country refused to work, essentially paralyzing the economic activities of major industrial cities in South Africa. On March 30, another 30,000 people in Cape Town broke out in protest demonstrations against racial discrimination. This situation clearly shows that the South African people have resolutely acted to oppose racial discrimination and fight for basic human rights!

People know that the South African Federation has the most barbaric and brutal racial discrimination system. In this country, a tiny minority of the white ruling class practices inhuman racial oppression against nearly ten million black people. In the South African Federation, 85% of the total agricultural population owns only 12.5% of the land; while a tiny minority of white colonists owns 87.5% of the land. The white government drove thousands upon thousands of Africans into crowded and barren "reserves" and dark prisons. The white government has formulated more than seventy racial discrimination laws, according to which the vast South African people are deprived of all human rights and freedoms, and become slave laborers in the mines and farms run by the colonists. The so-called "Pass Law" is a typical product of this barbaric racial discrimination system. Through this law, the colonists provide conditions for infinitely extracting cheap labor from blacks and implementing a forced labor system. In 1956 to 1957 alone, more than 640,000 people were arrested for violating the "Pass Law" and other minor crimes. These thousands upon thousands of innocent black South Africans became the victims of collusion between government officials, police, and white farmers. They were forcibly transported to farms, where they engaged in slave-like labor under the rawhide whips of armed military police. The entire South Africa is actually a large prison of racial oppression. The fact that the South African people have risen up to struggle shows that they can no longer tolerate continuing to live in this prison. They have every right to live a truly human life and destroy this large prison of racial discrimination.

Like all reactionary rulers throughout history, the South African authorities believe that as long as they intensify suppression and persecution, they can eliminate the people's just aspirations and quell the people's just struggles. But contrary to their reactionary subjective wishes, the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination has not been weakened or quelled under the bloody suppression of the South African authorities, but has developed more rapidly. Facts have proved that the bloody massacres of Africans by the South African white authorities in Vereeniging and Cape Town have not intimidated, and cannot intimidate, the South African people; the bullets, armored vehicles, and even jet planes of the white rulers have failed, and will never be able to, extinguish the South African people's burning anger against racial discrimination. The South African people have demonstrated the great power of their united struggle. Now, even South African Prime Minister Verwoerd admits that the South African government has "lost control" of the country's "situation." The white rulers of South Africa have been panicked in the face of the constantly rising situation of the South African people's anti-racial discrimination struggle. However, in order to stubbornly maintain their sinful system of racial discrimination, the white rulers of South Africa still dream of using armed suppression to eliminate the South African people's struggle power. The South African authorities have declared a "state of emergency" in eighty of the three hundred administrative regions across the country, and are conducting frantic arrests and suppressions nationwide. New massacres and persecutions of Africans are happening and increasing every day. However, all of this does not represent the strength of the South African reactionary forces; on the contrary, it only represents their desperate struggle to maintain the decaying racial discrimination system and the interests of colonial exploiters. There is no doubt that the South African authorities' intensified suppression of Africans will ultimately further stimulate the awakening of the South African people, promote their broader and more intense struggles, and thus accelerate the fate of the complete demise and collapse of the racial discrimination system and the rule of white colonists in South Africa.

Racial discrimination is originally the product of colonialism. It exists not only in South Africa but also prevails throughout Africa. Therefore, the struggle of the South African people cannot but be an important organizational part of the anti-colonialism and national independence movement of the entire African people; it cannot but have a huge impact on the struggles of the people of African countries against the colonial system. The struggle of the South African people will also be a great encouragement to the American blacks who are also suffering from the scourge of racial discrimination. Precisely because of this, all imperialists and colonialists in the world feel uneasy about this flame of anti-racial discrimination rising in the southernmost tip of the African continent. It is not difficult for people to see the awkward situation of the American ruling group from the attitude of the United States government towards the struggle of the South African people. American Assistant Secretary of State Wilcox frankly admitted that "the United States is reluctant to single out South Africa for criticism when many other countries in the world, including ourselves, are not blameless." The struggle of the South African people is just, and therefore they have the sympathy and support of the people of Africa, Asia, and the whole world who love justice. The South African authorities' bloody suppression of Africans has aroused a wave of angry protests from the public in Africa, Asia, and around the world. The governments and people of socialist countries and many Asian and African countries are actively supporting the just struggle of the South African people. The Chinese people have always had deep sympathy and warm support for the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights. We believe that the South African people, who today can begin to burn the "Passes" as "symbols of enslavement," will tomorrow surely burn down the entire large prison of racial discrimination and oppression, thereby urging the birth of a new and free South Africa. As long as the South African people continue to strengthen unity, make persistent efforts, and persevere in the struggle, no force can stop the South African people from moving towards the final victory of the anti-racial discrimination struggle!

    南非人民行动起来了！
    本报评论员
    南非人民继去年6月德班港的大示威运动之后，现在又掀起了一个以反“通行证法”为中心的反抗种族歧视制度斗争的新高潮。这一次斗争从未里尼琴的示威开始，仅仅几天时间就以迅猛之势蔓延到了南非全国，其声势和规模都是前所未有的。这些天来，南非各地人民纷纷举行示威、罢工、焚毁“通行证”，并且以石头和棍棒英勇地抗击了南非当局的武装镇压。3月28日，占南非联邦四分之三的非洲人举行了“哀悼日”，哀悼他们被白人当局屠杀的同胞。全国90％以上的非洲工人拒绝上工，使南非重要工业城市的经济活动基本上陷于瘫痪状态。3月30日，开普敦市又爆发了三万人的反对种族歧视的抗议示威。这种形势清楚地表明，南非人民为反对种族歧视和争取基本人权，已经坚决地行动起来了！
    人们知道，南非联邦存在着最野蛮、最残暴的种族歧视制度。在这个国度里，极少数的白人统治阶级对于将近一千万黑种人民实行着惨无人道的种族压迫。在南非联邦，全部农业人口的85％仅仅占有12.5％的土地；而极少数的白人殖民者却占有87.5％的土地。白人政府把成千成万的非洲人驱进拥挤不堪的贫瘠的“保留地”和阴暗的监狱。白人政府制订了七十余种种族歧视的法令，根据这些法令，广大的南非人民被剥夺了一切人权和自由，而成为殖民者经营的矿山和农场的奴隶劳动者。所谓“通行证法”就是这种野蛮的种族歧视制度的一个典型的产物。殖民者通过这个法令为无限止地榨取黑人的廉价劳动力和实施强迫劳动制度提供了条件。仅仅1956年到1957年就有六十四万多人以违犯“通行证法”和其它细小的罪名而被捕，这些成千上万的无辜的南非黑种人就成了政府官员、警察和白人农场主相互勾结的牺牲品。他们被强迫输送到农场去，在武装宪兵的犀皮鞭下，从事奴隶般的劳动。整个南非实际上就是一座种族压迫的大监狱。南非人民起来斗争的事实表明，他们再也不能容忍在这座监狱里继续生活下去了。他们有一切权利过真正的人的生活，摧毁这座种族歧视的大监狱。
    同古今天下的一切反动统治者一样，南非当局以为，只要加紧镇压和迫害，他们就能够消灭人民群众的正义愿望，就能够平息人民的正义斗争。但是和他们的反动的主观愿望相反，南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争力量在南非当局的血腥镇压之下不是削弱了、平息了，而是更加迅猛地发展起来了。事实证明，南非白人当局在未里尼琴和开普敦对非洲人的血腥屠杀并没有吓倒，而且不可能吓倒南非人民；白人统治者的枪弹、装甲车，以至喷气飞机也都未能，而且绝不可能扑灭南非人民燃烧起来的反对种族歧视的怒火。南非人民已经显示了他们团结斗争的巨大威力，现在就连南非联邦总理沃维尔德也承认，南非政府对于国家的“局势”已经“失去了控制”。南非的白人统治者面对着南非人民反种族歧视斗争不断高涨的形势，已经惊慌失措。但是，南非的白人统治者为了顽固地维护其种族歧视的罪恶制度，仍然幻想用武装镇压的手段来消灭南非人民的斗争力量。南非当局已经在全国三百个行政地区中的八十个地区宣布了“紧急状态”，并在全国范围内进行疯狂的逮捕和镇压。对非洲人的新的屠杀和迫害事件每天都在发生和增加着。然而，所有这一切并不能表示南非反动势力的强大，恰恰相反，这只是表示它们为维护腐朽的种族歧视制度和殖民剥削者的权益而进行的绝望的挣扎。毫无疑问，南非当局对非洲人的变本加厉的镇压，到头来只能进一步激发南非人民的觉悟，促进他们更加广泛、更加剧烈的斗争，从而加速种族歧视制度和白色殖民者的统治在南非彻底复亡、崩溃的命运。
    种族歧视本来就是殖民主义的产儿，它不仅在南非存在，而且流行于整个非洲。因此，南非人民的斗争就不能不是全非洲人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立运动的一个重要组织部分；不能不对非洲各国人民的反对殖民制度的斗争发生巨大的影响。南非人民的斗争，对于同样遭受着种族歧视的祸害的美国黑人来说，也将是一个极大的鼓舞。正因为如此，所以世界上一切帝国主义和殖民主义者都对这股在非洲大陆的最南端上空升起的反种族歧视的烈焰感到惶惶不安。人们不难从美国政府对南非人民的斗争所表示的态度中看出美国统治集团的尴尬处境。美国助理国务卿威耳科克斯坦率地供认，“美国不大愿意挑出南非来加以批评，当世界上许多其他国家包括我们自己在内也不是无可责难的时候。”南非人民的斗争是正义的，因此他们有着非洲、亚洲和全世界爱好正义的人民的同情和支持。南非当局对非洲人血腥镇压的暴行，已经激起了非洲、亚洲和全世界各国公众的愤怒抗议的浪潮。社会主义国家和亚非许多国家的政府和人民正在积极地支持着南非人民的正义斗争。中国人民一贯地对南非人民反对种族歧视，争取基本人权的斗争寄予深切的同情和热烈的支持。我们相信，南非人民今天既能够开始焚毁作为“奴役的象征”的“通行证”，明天，他们必将焚毁整个这座种族歧视和压迫的大监狱，从而催促一个新的自由的南非的诞生。只要南非人民继续紧紧地加强团结，再接再厉，坚持斗争，任何势力都不能阻挡南非人民走向反种族歧视斗争的最后的胜利！
