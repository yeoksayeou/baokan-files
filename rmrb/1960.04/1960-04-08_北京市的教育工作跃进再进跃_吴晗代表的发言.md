Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. In 1959, based on the great victories of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the people of Beijing, through opposing rightism and boosting morale, launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. In terms of industrial production, we fulfilled the total output value plan of 6.5 billion yuan 21 days ahead of schedule, completing 6.8 billion yuan for the whole year, an increase of 48% compared to 1958. In the first quarter of this year, we not only overfulfilled the state plan by 17.9%, but also significantly improved the production level compared to last year. The output value in the first quarter of this year increased by 78.3% compared to the same period last year and 11.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In terms of agricultural production, under the glorious banner of the People's Communes, we not only overcame the extraordinary floods of last year, but also greatly increased the total income of the People's Communes compared to 1958, expanding accumulation and increasing the income of the commune members. In transportation, capital construction, urban reconstruction, science, culture, education, sports, health, and other undertakings, we have been advancing at a high speed. Since entering 1960, our industrial and agricultural production has continued to leap forward. The industries run by the People's Communes and street offices have also advanced at a flying speed, completing an output value of 210 million yuan in the first quarter, exceeding the total industrial output value of Beijing in the entire year of 1949. Currently, a massive technological revolution and cultural revolution, sweeping through every corner of the city, is surging forward with irresistible force. I believe that, under the leadership of the Party and through the efforts of the people of the city, we will certainly be able to overfulfill the production targets set by the state for 1960.

    Below, I will report to the conference on a few issues concerning the educational work in Beijing in 1959.

    Beijing's educational work has implemented the Party's educational policy and widely launched mass movements, and is continuing to leap forward.

    The cultural revolution includes two aspects: one is the laborization of intellectuals, and the other is the intellectualization of the working people.

    Laborization of Intellectuals

    After the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and the implementation of the Party's educational policy, the vast number of teachers and students at all levels of schools have universally participated in productive labor. Through labor practice, they have not only preliminarily transformed their thoughts and feelings, but also improved the quality of teaching, scientific research, and learning. Universities are no longer academies divorced from reality, but have become bases that combine teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, with teaching as the main focus. For example, in 1959, 1,400 graduates of Tsinghua University completed 177 graduation designs that combined production construction and scientific research tasks, including the design of the Miyun Reservoir and the History Museum, and the trial production of program-controlled machine tools and miniature cars. Teachers and students worked together, turning construction sites into classrooms and laboratories. The students said that their graduation theses and scientific research reports were "not placed in display cabinets, but will forever stand on the land of the motherland." They also summarized a complete set of experiences: "real guns and real knives, combined with reality, organized collectively, collective operations, seamless connection, step-by-step improvement, in-depth focus, and comprehensive cultivation." Another example is the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, which collaborated with factories and mines in 1959 to carry out technological innovation and scientific research, achieving a four-way leap forward in learning, production, science, and ideology. At the end of last year, more than 500 teachers and students from the metallurgy, technology, and machinery departments went to 26 factories in Beijing to work with workers to carry out technological innovation, working, researching, and learning at the same time. They completed 829 innovation projects in forty days, improving the production level of the factories and enriching the content of scientific research. Another example is the Renmin University of China, where teachers and students have gone to factories and rural areas in more than 20 provinces and cities in the past two years to participate in productive labor, conduct large-scale social surveys and scientific research, and widely carry out theoretical popularization work on studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works in factories and rural areas. The entire university has written more than 2,300 investigation reports and papers. Teachers and students of the Philosophy Department carried out philosophy popularization work in the Shijingshan People's Commune and the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. After studying Chairman Mao's works, the thoughts of the workers and peasants were greatly liberated and their enthusiasm was even greater. A peasant sang praises: "Philosophy is a treasure, it opens the mind, production enthusiasm is high, and unity is well done!" Middle schools have also achieved great results in implementing the policy of "combining education with productive labor." Eighty-eight middle schools in the urban area have established cooperative relationships with 105 factories, and more than 70,000 middle school students regularly participate in productive labor. Students in suburban middle schools generally participate in agricultural labor. Young students eat, live, and work with workers and peasants, learn from workers and peasants, and establish close ties with the working people.

        Intellectualization of the Working People

    On the other hand, the intellectualization of the working people has also made great achievements. When Beijing was liberated, 80% of the workers in the city were illiterate. After these ten years, especially the great development of education in the past two years, this ratio has been reversed. Literate workers now account for 80% of the total number of workers, of which 50% have reached primary school level and 30% have reached junior or senior high school level or above. We plan to basically complete the task of eliminating illiteracy this year. Now a high tide of running spare-time education has emerged. More than one million young and middle-aged cadres, workers, peasants, and street residents throughout the city are participating in spare-time learning. The number of employees in factories and mines who are enrolled in school accounts for 70% of the total number of employees, initially forming a worker education network run by factories, jointly run by factories, jointly run by factories and schools, and run by regions. Among them, 53 factories and mines have established a complete set of spare-time education systems from primary school to university, 126 factories and mines have established spare-time secondary specialized schools, and urban and suburban districts have established district spare-time universities. Recently, we also created a television university, opening three courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, which were warmly welcomed by the masses. In less than a month after the start of school, more than 7,000 people participated in the study. The masses are running schools enthusiastically, linking learning with socialist construction and with technological innovation and technological revolution. They are diligent and enterprising, and a situation of "production driving education, education promoting production" and a double leap forward in production and education have generally appeared in industrial and mining enterprises. For example, in the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, workers with a junior high school education level or above now account for more than 50%, workers with a senior high school or university education level account for 23%, and those with a higher primary school education level account for about 23%. Workers with only a junior primary school education level and illiterates or semi-illiterates account for only about 3%. The improvement of the cultural and technical level of the employees has powerfully promoted the development of production. More and more workers can read blueprints and design tools. For example, worker Guo Zuosheng only had a higher primary school education level in the early days of liberation. Now? He has become a technician and is engaged in design work. Li Ruihuan, a young carpenter from the Third Construction Company of the city, has reached the senior high school level from junior primary school after four years of diligent study. As soon as he learned the principles of geometry, he created nine kinds of simple calculation tables and "earth formulas". By using these tables and formulas, he can avoid the "enlarging" process, which was always considered very complicated by carpenters and could only be done by senior craftsmen. Any carpenter who knows multiplication and division can do it, and, moreover, it used to take several days to "enlarge", but now it only takes a few minutes. The workers said: "Having culture is like a tiger with wings." Therefore, the broad masses of employees actively participate in learning, and the foundation of spare-time education is more solid than before.

    Some people once described the spare-time schools that were not consolidated in the past as "a boom, two loosenings, and three emptiness". Now, it is "one mobilization, two consolidations, and three improvements." The elimination of illiteracy and spare-time education in rural areas, based on the healthy development of the People's Communes, and under the call to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, has seen a new upsurge since last autumn and winter. This spring, it has also reversed the old convention of "full houses in winter, half in spring," and more than 300,000 farmers have persisted in learning during the busy spring season.

    In order to solve the need for teachers in the great development of spare-time education, we established the Worker-Peasant Teachers College last year as a base for cultivating teachers for worker-peasant spare-time education. At the same time, districts, counties, factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes have widely adopted the method of "taking materials locally and using the able as teachers" to run spare-time refresher schools, spare-time normal schools, and Sunday schools to accelerate the training of full-time and part-time teachers for spare-time education.

    Part-work and part-study is a new thing in the great leap forward in employee education in the past two years. Some factories and mines have started running part-work and part-study schools since 1958. Now, 12 factories and mines have set up part-work and part-study classes with more than 3,300 students. For example, the Chaoyang District Chemical Plant ran 25 part-work and part-study classes last year with 1,200 students, including 465 university students, 317 secondary technical students, and 432 junior high school students. In the past year or so, the general students have completed two or three courses. The spare-time study that needs to be completed in a year and a half, the part-work and part-study class completed in seven or eight months.

    Great Development of Various Types of Schools at All Levels

    In the past two years, higher education, secondary education, primary education, and pre-school education in Beijing have been developing at a high speed. In 1957, there were 33 universities in Beijing with 84,000 students. By the end of 1959, the number of universities had increased to 52, and the number of students had increased to 124,000. In 1957, there were 36 secondary specialized schools with 30,000 students. By the end of 1959, the number of schools had increased to 70, and the number of students had increased to 48,000. The number of middle and primary school students increased by 240,000 in two years, and there are currently 1,178,000. Primary education has been popularized among all school-age children in the city, and primary school graduates can basically enter junior high schools, achieving one primary school in every village and one middle school in every commune. By the end of 1959, the number of kindergartens had increased to 4,359, a fourfold increase compared to 1957. With the great development of various types of schools at all levels, the quality of teaching has also been significantly improved due to the implementation of the Party's education policy.

    Enlightenment from Experiments

    In terms of general education, we have also made some attempts at reform to address the phenomena of "less, slow, poor, and wasteful" in teaching. For example, five-year continuous system experiment was conducted in the Shijia Hutong Primary School, and the Baozi Hutong Primary School taught the two-year courses of senior primary school in one year. Now it seems that the results of these experiments are very good. Another example is that the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences once experimented with teaching algebra in the fifth grade of the Second Experimental Primary School, and the results of the experiment were successful. In addition, we also tried to compile the history textbooks of primary schools into a kind of story-style textbooks, selecting important events and characters in history and arranging them in chronological order. This not only avoids the repetition of the history textbooks of middle schools, but also changes the style and shortens the teaching time from two years to one year. Teachers and students believe that the new textbooks are simple in language, specific in content, easy to accept and understand, and the memory is relatively solid, and the effect is relatively good. The above-mentioned experiments are very enlightening to us. If we can study the methods of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in the main courses of primary and secondary schools, according to the spirit of the general line, so that the main courses such as mathematics and Chinese can be learned better and higher, the years of general education may be shortened, and the quality of education may be improved more. This will be a greater leap forward for our cause of cultivating talents for socialist construction!

    Dear representatives, the achievements of Beijing's education work in the past year are enormous. The achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the hard work and hard study of all education workers and students, and the victory of the policy of "education serving the politics of the proletariat, combining education with productive labor" and the policy of "walking on two legs" to develop education. The great cultural revolution and education revolution are in full swing. We are determined to forever hold high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought and push Beijing's education cause from one upsurge to a greater upsurge, and from one victory to a greater victory!

    北京市的教育工作跃进再进跃
    吴晗代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。1959年，在党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利的基础上，北京市的全体人民，通过反右倾、鼓干劲，开展了增产节约运动，实现了在1958年大跃进的基础上更好更全面的跃进。工业生产方面，提前二十一天完成了六十五亿元的总产值计划，全年完成了六十八亿元，比1958年增长了48％。今年第一季度，不仅超额17.9％完成了国家计划，而且生产水平比去年有了很大的提高，今年第一季度的产值比去年同期增长了78.3％，比去年第四季度增长了11.2％。农业生产方面，在人民公社这一光辉的旗帜下，不但战胜了去年的特大水涝灾害，而且人民公社的总收入还比1958年有很大的增加，既扩大了积累又增加了社员的收入。在交通运输、基本建设、城市改建、科学、文化、教育、体育、卫生等各项事业方面，都是高速度地大步前进。跨入1960年以来，我们的工农业生产正在继续跃进。人民公社和街道办的工业，也以飞跃的速度前进，第一季度已完成二亿一千万元的产值，超过了1949年全年北京市的工业总产值。目前，一个规模巨大的、席卷全市各个角落的技术革命和文化革命的高潮正在以不可阻挡之势汹涌澎湃地前进。我相信，在党的领导下通过全市人民的努力，我们一定能够超额完成国家规定的1960年生产指标。
    以下我仅就1959年北京市教育工作方面的几个问题，向大会报告。
    北京市的教育工作，贯彻执行了党的教育方针，广泛地开展了群众运动，正在继续向前跃进。
    文化革命包括两个方面，一方面是知识分子劳动化，一方面是劳动人民知识化。
    知识分子劳动化
    经过整风反右和贯彻执行党的教育方针，各级学校的广大师生普遍地参加了生产劳动，通过劳动实践，不但初步改造了思想感情，也提高了教学、科学研究和学习的质量。高等学校不再是脱离实际的读死书的学府，而已经成为以教学为主的教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合的基地了。例如清华大学1959年一千四百名毕业生完成了一百七十七项结合生产建设和科学研究任务的毕业设计，其中包括密云水库、历史博物馆的设计，程序控制机床和微型汽车的试制等重要项目。师生一起劳动，工地成为讲堂、实验室，学生的毕业论文和科学研究报告像他们自己说的：“不是放在陈列柜里，而是永远矗立在祖国的大地上。”他们还总结出“真枪真刀，结合实际，组织起来，集体作战，前后衔接，步步提高，深入重点，全面培养”的成套经验。又如北京钢铁学院1959年和厂矿协作，大搞技术革新和科学研究，获得了学习、生产、科学、思想四跃进。去年年底，又有冶金、工艺、机械三个系五百多名师生下到北京二十六个工厂，和工人一道大闹技术革新，边干活、边研究、边学习，四十天内完成了革新项目八百二十九项，提高了工厂的生产水平，丰富了科学研究的内容。又如中国人民大学师生两年来先后到二十多个省市的工厂和农村，参加生产劳动，大规模地进行了社会调查和科学研究，并且在工厂、农村中，广泛开展了学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的理论普及工作。全校共写出调查报告和论文二千三百多篇。哲学系师生在石景山人民公社和北京第一机床厂进行哲学普及工作，工农群众在学习了毛主席的著作以后，思想大大解放，干劲更足。有个农民歌颂“哲学是件宝，脑瓜开了窍，生产劲头高，团结搞好了！”中学在贯彻执行“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针方面，也取得了很大的成绩。城区八十八所中学已经同一百零五个工厂建立了协作关系，有七万多名中学生经常参加劳动生产。郊区中学的学生普遍参加了农业劳动。青年学生和工人农民同吃同住同劳动，拜工农为师，与劳动人民建立了密切的联系。
        劳动人民知识化
    另一面，劳动人民知识化，也有了很大的成绩。北京解放时，全市工人中有80％是文盲，经过这十年，特别是最近两年的教育事业大发展，这个比例数已经倒转了过来，工人中识字的人已经占工人总数的80％了。其中有50％达到小学程度，30％达到初中或高中以上程度。我们准备在今年内基本上完成扫除文盲的任务。现在大办业余教育的高潮已经出现，全市青壮年干部、职工、农民和街道居民，参加业余学习的已经超过一百万人，厂矿企业职工入学人数占职工总数的70％，初步形成了一个厂办、工厂联办、厂校联办、地区举办的职工教育网。其中有五十三个厂矿办起了从小学到大学一整套业余教育体系，一百二十六个厂矿办起了业余中等专业学校，城区和近郊区都办起了区业余大学。最近我们还创办了电视大学，开了数学、物理、化学三门课程，受到群众的热烈欢迎，开学不到一个月，就有七千多人参加学习。群众办学热火朝天，他们把学习同社会主义建设联系在一起，把学习同技术革新技术革命联系在一起，勤勉奋发，在工矿企业里，普遍出现“生产带动教育，教育促进生产”，生产、教育双跃进的局面。例如北京第一机床厂，现在初中程度的职工占50％以上，具有高中大学文化程度的职工占23％，高小程度的约占23％，初小程度和文盲、半文盲只剩下约3％了。职工文化技术水平的提高，有力地推动了生产的发展。工人有了文化，能够看图纸和设计工具的越来越多了，如工人郭作生，解放初期只有高小程度，现在呢？已经成为技术员，担任设计工作了。市第三建筑公司青年木工李瑞环，经过四年勤学苦钻，已经由初小达到高中水平，刚学会几何学原理，就创造出九种简易计算表和“土公式”，运用这些表式，就可以免去一向被木工们认为十分复杂、非得高级工匠才能做的“放大样”工序，任何一个木工只要会乘法除法就能做到，而且，从前“放大样”要花费几天工夫，现在只要几分钟就行了。工人说：“有了文化，就像老虎添了翅膀”，因此广大职工踊跃参加学习，业余教育的基础比以前巩固了。
    有人曾经形容过去办得不巩固的业余学校是“一轰，二松，三空”，现在呢，是“一发动，二巩固，三提高”了。农村的扫盲和业余教育在人民公社健康发展的基础上，在加速实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化的号召下，从去年秋冬以来，出现了新的高潮，今春也扭转了过去的“冬满堂，春一半”的旧常规，三十余万农民在春忙季节坚持了学习。
    为了解决业余教育大发展所需要的师资，我们在去年创办了工农师范学院，作为培养工农业余教育师资的基地。同时，各区、县，各厂矿企业，各人民公社广泛地采取了“就地取材，能者为师”的办法，举办业余进修学校、业余师范学校和星期日学校，来加速培养专职和兼职的业余教育的师资。
    半工半读是这两年职工教育大跃进中的新事物。有些厂矿从1958年起就创办半工半读的学校，到现在有十二个厂矿举办了半工半读班，有三千三百多名学员。例如朝阳区化工厂，去年办了二十五个半工半读班，有一千二百名学员，其中大学四百六十五人，中技三百十七人，初中四百三十二人。一年多以来，一般学员都学完了两三门课程，业余学习需要一年半学完的，半工半读班七、八个月就完成了。
    各级各类学校大发展
    这两年来北京市的高等教育、中等教育、初等教育以及幼儿教育正在高速度向前发展。1957年北京原有高等学校三十三所，学生八万四千人，到1959年底高等学校增加到五十二所，学生增加到十二万四千人。1957年原有中等专业学校三十六所，学生三万人，到1959年底，校数增加到七十所，学生增加到四万八千人。中、小学生在两年内增加了二十四万人，目前共有一百一十七万八千人。全市适龄儿童中已经普及了小学教育，并且小学毕业生基本上都能升入初中，作到了村村有小学，社社有中学。幼儿园1959年底增加到四千三百五十九所，比1957年增加了四倍。在各级各类学校大发展的同时，教学质量也由于贯彻了党的教育方针，有了显著的提高。
    从试验中得到的启发
    在普通教育方面我们针对着教学上存在着的少慢差费的现象，也作了一些改革的尝试。例如在史家胡同小学进行了五年一贯制的试验，报子胡同小学以一年的时间教完了高小两年的课程，现在看来，这些试验的结果都很好。又如科学院心理研究所曾在第二实验小学试验五年级学代数，试验结果是成功的。此外，我们还把小学的历史课本，试编成一种故事体裁的教科书，选择历史上重要事件和人物，按时间顺序编排，这样作，不但避免了和中学历史教材的重复，连体例也改变了，讲授时间也由两年缩短为一年。教师和学生都认为新课本文字浅显，内容具体，容易接受和理解，记忆也比较牢固，效果是比较好的。上边讲的这些试验对我们的启发很大。如果能在中小学的主要课程方面，根据总路线的精神，研究出多快好省的办法，使数学和语文等主要课程学的更好些、更高些，普通教育的年限就可能缩短，教育质量就可能提得更高一些。这对于我们培养社会主义建设人材的事业，将是一个更大的跃进！
    各位代表：北京过去一年的教育工作成绩是巨大的。成绩的取得是党的正确领导和全体教育工作者以及学生勤奋工作和勤奋学习的结果，是“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以及“两条腿走路”发展教育事业的方针的胜利，伟大的文化革命和教育革命方兴未艾，我们决心永远高举毛泽东思想的战无不胜的旗帜，把北京的教育事业从一个高潮推向更大的高潮，从一个胜利走向更大的胜利！
