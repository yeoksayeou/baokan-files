Party Committee Secretary's Notes

		Revolution in the Canteen
		Yang Zixin, First Secretary of the Hengshui People's Commune Committee, Mengjin, Henan

	Hengshui, an ancient town built during the Sui and Tang dynasties, is the political, economic, and cultural center of our commune. The No. 17 Canteen in the town is the experimental field of the commune party committee, and we are determined to create experience from it to promote the gradual improvement and rapid enhancement of all canteens in the commune. Passing through the No. 17 Canteen, one can see from the tall gatehouse the spacious courtyard, with two rows of towering and clean restaurants and twelve chimneys connected to the kitchen. In the middle of the courtyard, there are flower beds, fish ponds, and water taps. The elderly, young, sick, and postpartum women all have their own restaurants, with delicious and satisfactory meals every time. The club and library have various recreational equipment and easy-to-understand books and newspapers, so that everyone can find suitable leisure to spend their time after meals and during work breaks.

	In recent days, the cooks of the No. 17 Canteen have been engaged in a competition to diversify the food. What "Hexiang steamed buns," "Full Table Fragrance," etc., they have made dozens of new foods that have never been heard of, so that the commune members can eat meals with a name every time, and the meals do not repeat for a month. After dinner, I took the time to go to the No. 17 Canteen, wanting to find Comrade Lan Ying to learn about the achievements of the food reform. Just as I entered the door, I happened to see her coming out of the restaurant with a rag over her shoulder. When she saw me, she wiped her hands and ran towards me, smiling and saying, "Secretary Yang, you've come at the right time. We're going to try a new food tonight! Please participate in the guidance and personally appraise it." "Good! I'm here to see your 'Full Table Fragrance'!" With that, we walked into the kitchen together.

	A row of six bright electric lights hung on the clean ceiling, and the whole room was brightly lit. A group of cooks in white coats, surrounded in a circle, were listening to the cook squad leader Guo Xiuzhen explaining the method of making the new food being tested for the sixth time - "Delicious Crisp". Lan Ying told me that the trial production of "Delicious Crisp" had failed five times, but Xiuzhen was not discouraged, and tonight is another test after research.

	In no more than ten minutes, the first batch of golden and fragrant "Delicious Crisp" came out of the oven. Lan Ying handed me one and insisted that I try it. I couldn't refuse, so I had to try it. One bite was crispy and fragrant. I felt that it was indeed a good food suitable for both the old and the young, but Guo Xiuzhen tasted it and said that the taste was not up to standard and the heat was not enough. She added some baking soda and sesame oil to the dough, reduced the flame, and finally baked the "Delicious Crisp" that was crispier and more焦. Lan Ying told me that Xiuzhen had studied in Zhengzhou, and in order to make this delicious food that was both tooth-saving and easy to digest for the elderly and children, she had spent four nights.

	The wave of tool reform has swept through every corner of the commune. Each production brigade, each factory and mine, and various departments in the township have been vigorously engaged in tool reform. Under the direct leadership and strong support of the brigade branch, the No. 17 Canteen has also set off a climax of cooking utensil reform.

	Branch Secretary Cui Yue and Canteen Director Han Lan Ying told me about the situation. I expressed my strong support, and according to their requirements, I transferred four of the most skilled iron and wood workers from the commune's machine repair factory to assist them in their work, encouraging them to rely on the wisdom of the masses and to achieve a great victory in the reform of cooking utensils. If there are any difficulties, the party committee will definitely find a way to solve them. They excitedly assured me that they would never disappoint the care of the party committee and would resolutely realize the semi-mechanization of cooking utensils within half a month.

	For four consecutive days, because production was busy and there were many party committee meetings, although I always kept the matter of cooking utensil reform in mind, I didn't have time to go and see it in person, but Lan Ying constantly reported the daily achievements. Late on the fifth night, I had just finished the telephone conference of the major brigade party secretaries and walked into my living room when I found a piece of paper on my desk with a few lines of beautiful handwriting: Secretary Yang: The party committee's care, support, and encouragement have blossomed in our canteen. The reform of cooking utensils has achieved initial success. The seven-purpose vegetable cutting machine and dumpling making machine have been successfully trial-produced, and it has been decided to complete the installation tonight and test the machine. We warmly hope that you will come to inspect it! You are in a meeting, I have to hurry back to prepare for the test run, can't wait long, please go to appraise after the meeting. Good night! Lan Ying.

	After reading it, the excitement made me forget my fatigue, and I turned around and walked to the No. 17 Canteen.

	As soon as I entered the gate of the No. 17 Canteen, I heard the "rumbling" of the machine turning, mixed with the laughter of the girls coming from the kitchen. I pushed open the door and walked into the kitchen, and saw Lan Ying putting the washed vegetables into the entrance of the vegetable cutting machine. As a result, with a "swishing" sound, clusters of shredded vegetables burst out from the exit.

	Behind the dumpling making machine, Guo Xiuzhen poured half a bag of flour into the entrance for noodles, and An Huamin poured a basin of clear water from another opening. Vegetables were loaded into the machine body from another opening. The machine wheels kept turning, and evenly and neatly formed dumplings were continuously spit out from the exit. What ingenious cooking utensils!

	In just ten days, the cooking management personnel of the No. 17 Canteen, after many experiments, finally produced eight kinds and thirteen pieces of new cooking utensils such as vegetable cutting machines, kneading machines, dishwashing machines, dumpling making machines, and traction mills, and laid iron rails on the passages from the kitchen to the granary and the restaurant, and installed three winch transport vehicles, so that the entire cooking and transfer operation realized semi-mechanization, saving a total of twenty-seven cooks, and also increasing the cooking efficiency by six times.

### 食堂里闹革新

    食堂里闹革新	中共河南孟津横水公社委员会第一书记　杨自信
    横水这个建自隋、唐的古镇，是我们公社政治、经济、文化的中心。镇上十七食堂，是公社党委的试验田，我们决心从中创造经验，来推动全公社食堂的逐步改进和迅速提高。走过十七食堂，从高大的门坊望去，就可以看到宽敞的院子里，有两排巍峨整洁的餐厅和一连十二个烟囱的厨房，院子中间有花坛、鱼池和自来水管。老、幼、病人和产妇都有自己的餐厅，顿顿有可口如意的饭菜。俱乐部、图书室有各种娱乐用具和通俗易懂的书报，人人都能找到适意的消遣，来度过饭后、工闲的时间。
    近几天来，十七食堂的炊事员们一直在闹饭菜多样化的竞赛。什么合香馍啦，满桌香呀，她们已制成了几十种从未听说过的新食品，使社员们吃到了顿顿有名堂，一月不重样的饭菜。晚饭后，我抽空往十七食堂去，想找兰英同志了解一下改革饭菜的成绩，恰巧一进门便碰到她搭着一条抹布从餐厅里出来。她见了我一面擦着手，一面向我跑来，满面带笑地说：“杨书记，你来得正好，今晚我们正要试制一种新的食品呢！请你参加指导，并亲自鉴定。”“好！我就是来看你们‘满桌香’呢！”说着我俩一同走进了厨房。
    光洁的天花板上一排挂着六个明亮的电灯，满屋亮堂堂的，一群白衣的炊事姑娘，围成了一个圆圈，正在听炊事班长郭秀珍讲解今晚作第六次试验的新食品——可口酥的制法。兰英告诉我，试制“可口酥”已失败过五次了，但秀珍没有灰心，今晚是研究后的又一次试验。
    顶多十分钟的时间，第一炉黄焦喷香的“可口酥”下炉了，兰英递给我一个，一定要我尝尝。我推辞不过只好尝尝，搭嘴一咬酥脆喷香，觉得确实是老少可口的上好食品，但是郭秀珍一尝，却说味道不到家，火候也差。她又在面里兑了些小苏打，加了些香油，压小些火苗，最后才烘出了更酥更焦的“可口酥”。兰英告诉我秀珍从郑州学习回来，为了给老人和小孩制这种既省牙又好消化的美味食品，曾整整用了四个夜晚了。
    工具改革的浪潮，已经席卷了公社的各个角落，各生产大队，各厂矿以及乡里各部门都雷厉风行地大闹工具改革。十七食堂也在大队支部的直接领导和大力支持下掀起了炊具改革的高潮。
    支部书记崔月和食堂主任韩兰英两位同志把情况告诉了我，我表示大力支持，并根据他们的要求从公社机修厂拨给他们四个技术最高的铁木工人，协助他们进行工作，鼓励他们依靠群众智慧，一定要取得炊具改革的巨大胜利。如果有什么困难，党委一定设法解决。他们兴奋得向我保证：绝不辜负党委的关怀，坚决要在半月内实现炊具半机械化。
    一连四天，因为生产忙，党委会议也多，我虽然始终惦记着炊具改革的事，但却没时间亲自去看看，只是兰英不断来汇报每天的成绩。第五天的深夜，我刚刚结束了各大队支部书记的电话会议，走进了自己的住室，就发现了办公桌上放着一张纸条，上面写着几行秀丽的字迹：杨书记：党委的关怀、支持和鼓励，在我们食堂开了花，炊具改革取得了初步的成就，七用切菜机、包饺子机都试制成功，并决定在今晚完成装置后试车，我们热情地希望你来验收！你正开会，我得赶快回去作试车准备，不能久等，请你会后去鉴定。	　晚安！　兰英。
    看后，兴奋的心情使我忘掉了疲乏，转身就往十七食堂走去。
    一走进十七食堂的大门，就听到“隆隆”的机器转动声，夹杂着姑娘们的笑声从厨房里传了出来。我推门走进厨房，见兰英正把洗好的青菜投入切菜机的入口，结果随着“沙沙”的声音，从出口迸出了一团团细碎的菜丝。
    在包饺子机的后面，郭秀珍从进面口倒入了半袋面粉，安化民从另一开口处倒入了一盆清水，青菜从另一个口里装进了机身，机轮不停地转着，均匀整齐的饺子便从出口处连续吐了出来，多么精巧的炊具啊！
    仅仅十天的时间，十七食堂的炊管人员经过了多次试验，终于制成了切菜机、和面机、洗碗机、包饺子机、牵引磨等八种十三件新炊具，并在厨房通往粮库、餐厅的甬道上，铺上了铁轨，装上了三部绞索运输车，使整个炊事，转送操作实现了半机械化，共节省了炊事员二十七人，而炊事效率还提高了六倍。
