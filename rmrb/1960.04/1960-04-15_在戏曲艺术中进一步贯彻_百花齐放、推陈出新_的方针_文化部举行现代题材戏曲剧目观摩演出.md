Xinhua News Agency, 13th. In order to further implement the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" in opera art, the Ministry of Culture is holding a modern theme opera performance in the capital starting today. The opera performed tonight was the Peking Opera "Sichuan White-Haired Girl" performed by the Experimental Peking Opera Troupe of the Chinese Opera School. Responsible comrades from the Ministry of Culture watched tonight's performance.

The rising stars of the opera world creatively used traditional performance techniques in today's performance of "Sichuan White-Haired Girl" to vividly portray the story of peasants fighting against landlords and despots. The female lead, Liu Xiurong's, performance not only concentrated the steady and dignified, bright and brave characteristics of Qingyi, Huadan, and Daomadan, but also appropriately adopted some movements of Wusheng and Hualian when expressing strong feelings of revenge. This opera also has some new attempts in singing, dialogue, and crowd scenes, and can boldly break through certain limitations of traditional performance methods on the basis of deeply understanding the traditional spirit.

This performance is being held in conjunction with touring performances by local troupes in Beijing. Ten troupes and six opera genres, totaling more than 600 people, are participating in the performance. Representatives from all provinces and autonomous regions in the country have been sent to observe. The programs to be performed successively include the Pingju opera "Zhang Shizhen" by the Tianjin Pingju Opera Troupe; the Huju opera "Spark" by the Shanghai People's Huju Opera Troupe; the Peking Opera "Barin Anger" by the Zhaowuda League Peking Opera Troupe of Inner Mongolia; the Henan Opera "Winter Goes, Spring Comes" by the Third Troupe of the Henan Opera Institute; the Luju opera "Cheng Hongmei" by the Anhui Province Luju Opera Delegation; the Peking Opera "White Clouds and Red Flag" by the Second Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre; the Pingju opera "Jinsha River" by the China Pingju Theatre; the Pingju opera "Ode to the Eight Women" by the Qiqihar Pingju Opera Troupe of Heilongjiang; and the drama team of the Beijing Quyi Troupe's "For the Sixty-One Class Brothers". These programs are all excellent modern dramas created since the Great Leap Forward and are deeply loved by the local people. Many of them depict heroic figures and communist morals in the current socialist construction, and there are also stories of historical revolutionary struggles. After the performance, these programs will be publicly performed in the capital.

The Ministry of Culture attaches great importance to this performance. A symposium will be held during the performance and people from the capital's theater circles will be invited to participate. At the meeting, experiences will be summarized, understanding will be improved, and mutual learning will be carried out in order to promote the creation of more and better modern dramas in the opera world, educate the people, and meet the rapidly growing cultural needs of the people.

    在戏曲艺术中进一步贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针
    文化部举行现代题材戏曲剧目观摩演出
    新华社13日讯　为了在戏曲艺术中进一步贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，文化部今天起在首都举行现代题材戏曲剧目观摩演出。今晚演出的剧目是中国戏曲学校实验京剧团表演的京剧“四川白毛女”。文化部负责同志观看了今晚的演出。
    戏曲界后起之秀在今天演出的“四川白毛女”中，创造性地运用传统表演手法，生动地表现了农民与地主恶霸斗争的故事。女主角刘秀荣的表演不仅集中了青衣、花旦、刀马旦各种旦行的稳重端庄，爽朗勇敢的特点，而且在表现强烈的复仇情感时适当采用了一些武生、花脸的动作。这个戏在唱腔、念白、群众场面等方面也都有一些新的尝试，能在深刻领会传统精神的基础上，大胆突破传统表演方法的某些局限性。
    这次观摩演出是结合外地赴京巡回演出举行的，参加观摩演出的有十个剧团、六个剧种，共六百多人。全国各省、自治区都派代表前来观摩。将要陆续演出的剧目有天津市评剧团的“张士珍”；上海市人民沪剧团的“星星之火”；内蒙昭乌达盟京剧团的“巴林怒火”；河南豫剧院三团的“冬去春来”；安徽省卢剧代表团的“程红梅”；中国京剧院二团的“白云红旗”；中国评剧院的“金沙江畔”；黑龙江齐齐哈尔评剧团的“八女颂”；北京市曲艺团戏剧队的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”。这些剧目都是大跃进以来创作的、深受当地群众欢迎的优秀现代剧目，其中不少是表现当前社会主义建设中英雄人物和共产主义的道德风尚，也有历史革命斗争的故事。观摩演出后，这些剧目将在首都进行公演。
    文化部对这次观摩演出极为重视，观摩演出期间将举行座谈会并邀请首都戏剧界人士参加。会上将总结经验、提高认识、相互学习，以推动戏曲界创作出更多更好的现代剧目，教育人民，满足人民群众迅速增长的文化生活需要。
