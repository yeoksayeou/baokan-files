Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 9th: The Japan Coal Miners' Union held its 25th extraordinary convention in Tokyo today.

    162 delegates and 400 observers attended the convention. 91 delegates from the Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union, who were recently persecuted by coal industry monopoly capitalists, also rushed to attend the convention.

    Hara Shigeru, chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, said at the meeting: At a time when monopoly capitalists are threatening us with the large-scale dismissal of 110,000 miners, the most important thing for us is to establish a strong fighting organization that can wage an unyielding struggle against the capitalists' conspiracy. He pointed out that this is also what the monopoly capitalists fear most.

    Ota Kaoru, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said at the meeting that the mediation plan proposed by the Central Labor Relations Commission regarding the Miike Coal Mine workers' strike faithfully reflected the capitalists' intentions. Ota emphasized that accepting this mediation plan—which stipulates the dismissal of 1,200 union activists—is tantamount to suicide for the workers, allowing the capitalists to dismiss the most heroic among the workers who are dedicated to defending the lives and rights of all workers.

    Ota emphasized that if the miners want to prevent large-scale layoffs from occurring in other companies and coal mines in the future, it is necessary for all miners to provide the greatest support to the Miike Coal Mine workers.

    Asanuma Inejirō, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, after condemning the mediation plan of the Central Labor Relations Commission, emphasized that the attack on the coal miners is closely related to the Japanese ruling class's attempt to revive militarism.

    Asanuma Inejirō said, "Let us unite and move towards Japan's complete independence and peace. We must prevent the Diet from ratifying the revised Japan-U.S. Security Treaty."

    Nosaka Sanzō, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, said that the coal miners' struggle against large-scale layoffs is a just struggle and is closely related in nature to the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He emphasized that the working class can strengthen the movement against the new "Security Treaty" through the struggle against layoffs.

    Nosaka Sanzō encouraged the delegates to the convention by saying that the monopoly capitalists' attack on the coal miners is not because they are strong; on the contrary, it reflects that they are already in a difficult situation. Nosaka emphasized that now is the time for all workers to rise up and fight against the dismissal of the Miike Coal Mine workers.

    野坂参三在日本煤矿工会临时大会发言
    号召日本工人支持三池矿工
    指出矿工的反解雇斗争可以加强反对日美条约的运动
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本煤矿工会今天在东京举行第二十五次临时大会。
    出席大会的有一百六十二名代表和四百名观察员。不久前遭到煤业垄断资本家迫害的三池煤矿工会的九十一名代表也赶来参加大会。
    日本煤矿工会主席原茂在会上说：在垄断资本家以大规模开除十一万矿工的行动来威胁我们的时候，对我们说来，最重要的是建立能够进行不屈不挠的斗争来反对资本家这一阴谋的强大的斗争组织。他指出，这也是垄断资本家所最害怕的东西。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏在会上说，中央劳动委员会所提出的关于三池煤矿工人罢工的调停方案忠实地反映了资本家的意图。太田强调指出，接受这个调停方案——规定开除一千二百名工会积极分子——就等于工人自杀，让资本家把工人中献身于保卫全体工人的生活和权利的那部分最英勇的人开除出去。
    太田强调说，如果矿工们要想防止其他公司和煤矿将来遭到大规模解雇的事件，那么全体矿工有必要对三池煤矿工人提供最大的支援。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在谴责中央劳动委员会的调停方案后强调指出，对煤矿工人的袭击同日本统治阶级复活军国主义的企图是密切关连的。
    浅沼稻次郎说，“让我们团结起来，朝着日本的完全独立与和平前进。我们必须阻止国会批准修改后的日美安全条约”。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三说，煤矿工人反对大规模解雇的斗争是正义的斗争，而且在性质上同反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争有密切关系。他强调说，工人阶级通过反对解雇的斗争，可以加强反对新“安全条约”的运动。
    野坂参三鼓励大会代表说，垄断资本家袭击煤矿工人并不是因为他们强大，正相反，这反映出他们已经陷于困境。野坂强调说，现在是所有的工人奋起斗争反对开除三池煤矿工人的时候了。
