    Ode to the Germination Hand
    Zhao Guandong
    Some time ago, in a production team in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, an experienced old farmer enthusiastically told me about steam-accelerated germination. This year, in order to continuously advance the Great Leap Forward and implement the Leaping Forward seeds in the fields as early as possible, the members have comprehensively promoted the steam-accelerated germination method, allowing the seeds to sprout and be sown early. Then, he enthusiastically led me to see the germination room. Upon entering the room, it was steaming hot, and basket after basket of rice seeds had already sprouted. Turning around, I saw a bed in the room, which I found a bit strange. The old farmer smiled and said to me, "Living and eating in the room is more convenient for taking care of them!" He then told me about how tender and weak the seeds are when they are about to sprout, and how he diligently watches and checks them to prevent cold and rot… "If you don't do this, what's the point of accelerating germination!"
    The old farmer's attitude towards new things is correct. Marxists always treat new things with full enthusiasm, applauding and cheering for them, clearing the way for them, and removing all the thorns and rocks that hinder their development. Isn't that so? In the current mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, many factories and mines have such examples: At the beginning, a worker puts forward a rationalization proposal, no matter how immature or rough this proposal may be, the Party's leaders at all levels always nod with a warm smile, mobilize all kinds of forces to help him, and support him. Thus, the proposal goes from rough to refined, and finally a new tool is created. Aren't the stories of many innovation champions and inventors that we are familiar with like this?
    When new things are still in the budding, immature, and weak stage, they are not so perfect, and you can indeed pick out some faults. At this critical juncture, it is the best time to test whether your attitude towards new things is sincere or false. Do you support it, sponsor it, assist it, encourage it to grow, and promote its growth? Or do you ignore it, treat it lightly, or even ridicule and laugh at it, and deliberately destroy it, intending to kill it? Accelerating germination and destroying are two completely different attitudes. Lenin said: "We should meticulously study the new shoots, treat them with extreme care, do our best to help them grow, and 'nurture' these weak shoots" (The Great Beginning). The old farmer who focuses on cultivating, accelerating germination, and promoting growth is like this, and all proletarian revolutionaries also hold this attitude. Destruction is the attitude of non-Marxists. Lu Xun once severely condemned the attitude of those malicious critics. In his article "Before There Was Genius," he said: "It is certainly very pleasant for malicious critics to gallop their horses on the ground of tender seedlings; but it is the tender seedlings that suffer - ordinary seedlings and genius seedlings alike." (Complete Works of Lu Xun, Volume 1, page 277) We oppose this malicious critic, the nag of bourgeois revolutionaries "holding the skeptical attitude of intellectuals," trampling on the ground of tender seedlings. We should all unswervingly stand on the Marxist position and be promoters and germination hands of new things.
    Newborn things have extremely strong vitality. Not long after, I went to this production team again. As soon as the old farmer saw me, he pulled me to the field. Looking at it, wow! My eyes were full of lush green, and the rice seedlings were a verdant green, truly embodying the four characters "thriving and prosperous." I couldn't help shaking the old farmer's shoulders and shouting, "Long live the germination hand!"

    催芽手赞
    赵贯东
    前些日子，我在浙江省上虞县的一个生产队里，一位富有经验的老农，兴致勃勃地给我讲蒸气催芽。今年，社员们为了持续大跃进，抢早把跃进种子落实到田间，都全面地推广蒸气催芽法，使种子早发、早播。接着，他又热情地领我去看催芽室。一进室，热气腾腾，一箩箩的稻谷种子，都已吐出了芽头。转身我又看到了室内还安了一张床铺，我有点奇怪。老农笑着对我说：“吃住在室内，照顾方便呀！”他又给我说了一些在种子将出芽时，怎样稚嫩、弱小，他又怎样勤看细查，防寒防烂……“不这样，那怎叫催芽呀！”
    老农对待新生事物的态度是正确的。马克思主义者总是满腔热情地对待新事物，为它鼓掌欢呼，为它鸣锣开道，为它清除一切阻碍新事物发展的荆棘乱石。不是吗？在当前大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多厂矿都会有这样的事例：开始时，一个工人把一项合理化建议提出来了，尽管这个建议最初是多么不成熟，多么粗糙，党的各级领导总是那么热情地含笑点头，动员各种力量帮助他，支持他，于是这个建议从粗到精，终于一项新的工具被创造了出来。我们熟悉的不少革新闯将创造发明的故事，不正是这样吗？
    当新事物还处在萌芽的、幼稚的、弱小的阶段时，不是那样地完美无缺的，你委实能够挑剔出一些毛病来。就在这个节骨眼里，是考验你对新事物的态度是真心还是假意的最好时候。你是支持它，赞助它，扶植它，催它茁长，促它壮大呢？还是对它漠不关心，等闲视之，甚至加以讥讽、嘲笑，不惜有意摧残，存心捕杀。催芽与摧残，这是两种截然不同的态度。列宁说：“我们应当缜密地研究新的幼芽，极仔细地对待它们，尽力帮助它们成长，并‘照护’这些柔弱的幼芽”（伟大的创举）。着意培育、催芽助长的老农是这样，一切无产阶级革命家也都是抱着这种态度。摧残是非马克思主义者的态度。鲁迅曾经严厉地谴责过那种恶意的批评家的态度。他在“未有天才之前”一文中说：“恶意的批评家在嫩苗的地上驰马，那当然是十分快意的事；然而遭殃的是嫩苗——平常的苗和天才的苗。”（鲁迅全集卷一，277页）我们反对这种恶意的批评家、“抱着知识分子的怀疑态度”的资产阶级革命家的驽马，在嫩苗的地上践踏。我们都应该坚定不移地站在马克思主义的立场上，做新事物的催芽手和促进派。
    新生的事物是具有极其强大的生命力的。过了不久，我又到这个生产队，老农一见了我，一把就将我拉到田头。一看，吓！满眼郁郁青青，秧苗一片碧绿，正合“欣欣向荣”四字。我不禁摇晃着老农的肩膀，高呼：“催芽手万岁！”
