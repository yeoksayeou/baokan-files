Comrades of the meeting:

    I am honored to participate in the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At this meeting, I listened to the "Work Report" made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I also attended the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress and listened to the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 Draft National Budget" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. I have once again received a profound education in Marxism-Leninism, and I feel sincerely encouraged.

    In the past few years, under the leadership and education of the Party, and under the supervision and help of the masses, I have been reforming myself, participating in learning, visits, and short-term labor training. I have become increasingly aware of the seriousness of my mistakes and crimes, and I feel boundless remorse. At the same time, facing the excellent situation of the leap-forward development of socialist construction, I am even more mindful of the Party's great kindness. In addition, the enthusiastic encouragement of the masses and the inspiration of new things have rejuvenated me, making my desire for reform more urgent and my confidence stronger. Now, I would like to briefly describe some of my recent experiences gained through study, visits, and labor, and I welcome criticism and assistance from the committee members.

    From learning and visits to various places, I have specifically realized that the Party and Chairman Mao have given the people of the whole country abundant and vigorous vitality. The leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is the guarantee of the prosperity of the people, the prosperity of society, the strength of the country, and the source of all strength. During this visit to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, I saw that the population of Inner Mongolia is flourishing, the production and construction of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry are leaping forward, and the economic and cultural life of the people is rapidly changing its backwardness. A flourishing population is a great happy event for the Mongolian people and other ethnic minorities. In the past, under reactionary rule, the population decline of the Mongolian people and other ethnic minorities was extremely serious. For many years, they longed for the elimination of diseases and a flourishing population. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it has indeed been realized. The Mongolian population has increased from 830,000 in 1946 to 1,130,000. The populations of other ethnic groups have also increased similarly. The people in pastoral areas are holding their babies, joyfully thanking "the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for sending us children." Inner Mongolia's industry has now established a preliminary foundation. The value of industrial output has increased from 9.4% in 1949 to 50% in 1959. The increase in 1958 reached 83.21%, and it increased again by 57.7% in 1959. It already has a substantial number of one million employees. The Mongolian people, who had very few even handicraftsmen in the old days, now have a worker force of more than 40,000. After the collectivization of agriculture and animal husbandry, production leaped forward, and the people's lives rapidly improved, with even more significant changes in the pastoral areas. We visited the Xinbaolege People's Commune in Darhan Muminggan United Banner. In 1959, the average income per person reached 303 yuan, an increase of 46% over the previous year. Some households earned 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Schools, hospitals, and post and telecommunications offices have been established, and there are five tractors. Mechanization will be realized in three years. They sing: "New atmosphere in the grasslands, cattle and sheep are fat, babies are strong, people and livestock are prosperous and happy, thank our benefactors Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." "In the past, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, under the leadership of the Party, achieved revolutionary victory after a long struggle. After liberation, they carried out a series of reforms. In 1957 and the first half of 1958, they also carried out political and ideological socialist revolution, launched the anti-Rightist struggle and the anti-local nationalism struggle, and achieved great victories. Under the new situation, they implemented the Party's General Line and launched the Great Leap Forward movement and the rural people's commune movement, resulting in an unprecedented Great Leap Forward situation. In short, all the victories of the people of Inner Mongolia have been achieved under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and through class struggle."

    The Party's leadership is an invincible commander who is victorious in every battle. We must not leave or weaken the Party's leadership for even a second. This is a fundamental law. Violating this law will lead to serious mistakes and failures. The historical events of the entire era fully prove that this law cannot be violated. However, I seriously violated this law. What was the reason? This is a question I have repeatedly asked myself. My answer some time ago was: First, I treated the Party's relationship from a bourgeois individualistic point of view, supporting the Party in words but pursuing personal fame and position in reality. Second, I joined the middle road early on, and I have been deeply poisoned by reformism, and I have never made a conscious fundamental transformation. Third, I stood on the bourgeois stand, falsely borrowed Marxism-Leninism, and misinterpreted the Party's policies. With these points, when the struggle between the two roads on the political and ideological fronts reached a critical juncture, I firmly stood on the bourgeois reactionary stand, exposed the ugly face of individualism, and confronted the Party's leadership. Recently, due to studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and combining them with visits, the rapid development of socialist construction has served as a mirror for me, making me see more clearly my past relationship with the Party. The bourgeois individualistic stance is essentially antagonistic to the Party's stance. Without accepting reform, it will inevitably become increasingly incompatible with the increasingly profound development of the socialist revolution. Not only that, but I also carried a heavy burden, posing as progressive and looking down on grassroots worker-peasant cadres. In my work, I often harbored resentment against cadres related to my work. This resentment was essentially a resistance to the dictatorship of the proletariat. At the same time, I relied on the Party's trust and thought that I would never make political mistakes, but the facts were quite the opposite. The reactionary essence must be exposed. When the socialist transformation in the economic field was victorious, fundamentally changing capitalist relations of production, I brazenly wanted to fight for capitalist "freedom" and "democracy" in the political and ideological fields. I thought that the diversification of forms of transition from capitalism to socialism was a new situation, that class struggle in China had ended, and that bourgeois intellectuals could retain more political freedom because the Party wanted to mobilize their enthusiasm, attempting to seize these political assets and compete with the Party's cadres. This directly opposed the socialist revolutionary movement, which was advancing rapidly under the leadership of the Party. The mighty force of the labor army breaking through the remnants of capitalism was like a thunderbolt, and it was natural to be battered and bruised. Thinking about it now still makes me tremble with fear. However, the clearer I understand this ideologically, the more fortunate I feel to be saved by the Party. The Party's education and meticulous care for me are like the sun and spring breeze that bring the dead back to life. I am extremely honored to be able to be reformed, to be an ordinary worker in the Mao Zedong era, and to live a real life.

    During visits to various places, I saw everywhere the working people, under the guidance of the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, vigorously launching mass movements. The wisdom of labor creation is infinite, one wave higher than another, and the surging momentum is unstoppable. Last year, when I visited Anyang, Henan, the achievements of the masses in making steel and running industries, from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, were extraordinarily brilliant. Among them, there was a steel enterprise that started with three people and developed to 1,200 people. This time, during my visit to Inner Mongolia, I also saw that the combination of large, medium, and small enterprises, and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, have made industry leap forward. The momentum of technological innovation and technological revolution among the masses is even stronger than last year. In Hohhot City, there is a cinema machinery repair shop with only twelve employees. During the Great Leap Forward, it was changed to a manufacturing factory. Last year, it successfully trial-produced more than ten new products, and this year, it is designing and trial-producing advanced and cutting-edge projects, such as widescreen enlargers, widescreen magnetic sound heads, and new mobile projectors. The factory now has 94 employees, 85% of whom are young apprentices, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution. They said: "We have been ridiculed and obstructed by some Right-leaning ideas; but in the end, those who win are not them, but always the people who dare to think and act under the leadership of the Party." How heroic this is. The scale of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in Baotou Steel is even larger, and the achievements are even more astonishing. The design level was originally very high, but after the masses vigorously engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution movements, the level of automation was raised even higher, and many of the new technologies were created by young workers.

    The Baiyunebo Mining Area of Baotou Steel is now a mine with automated mechanical equipment powered by electricity, which will soon be completed. A new city with a population of more than 25,000 has been built on the grassland. However, the initial exploration team faced arduous struggles with nature in the vast and desolate grasslands, with no water to drink, only snow to use as water, and easily getting lost when going out. They relied on the Party, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and relied on the masses to overcome all difficulties. Today, highways, railways, postal and telecommunications networks extend in all directions, electric lights flicker, red flags fly, and bright clouds are added to the vast and boundless grasslands.

    Drinking water reminds me of the source, which makes me think of the thousands upon thousands of such brilliant achievements across the country, and the thousands upon thousands of cadres who are not afraid of any difficulties and do everything possible to complete tasks for the Party. Wherever the Party points, they rush to that place. How noble this communist style is, how admirable and lovely.

    The soaring enthusiasm of the people of the whole country since the Great Leap Forward and the mass movements, one high tide after another, are a national production movement, a national labor cooperation and worker-peasant cooperation movement, and a national cultural revolution and technological revolution movement. The fact that intellectuals serve the workers and peasants is the only glorious path is even more obvious in this situation. However, my past thoughts and actions were exactly the opposite. I acknowledged in words that labor creates the world, but in my heart, I harbored a sense of superiority as an intellectual, looked down on manual labor, looked down on the working people, and regarded knowledge and technology as personal capital. I abstractly acknowledged that history is created by the masses of the people, but in reality, I separated myself from the masses and stood above them, giving orders. These shameful reactionary thoughts of the exploiting class constantly clashed with the political and social life of the dictatorship of the working class and labor rule. Although I have been constantly criticizing my various erroneous thoughts in the two years of learning and transformation, and have received help from leaders, the masses, and many friends and teachers, gradually making me aware of my mistakes, the roots have not been eradicated, and poisonous weeds often sprout. Here, I have just unloaded my burden, and in another situation, I carry it again. The attitude of being self-righteous and not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses is still an obstacle to my own reform. I have always understood the path of intellectuals going deep among the masses and combining with the workers and peasants as a path for intellectuals to synthesize and improve the labor experience of the workers and peasants. That is to say, intellectuals are teachers of the workers and peasants, rather than learning from the workers and peasants. This obviously wrong idea of putting the cart before the horse was not corrected until I studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and combined it with visits and labor, and saw many vivid facts. To eradicate evil thoroughly, I am determined to make up my mind, go all out, and strengthen reform.

    I have gradually changed my attitude towards labor in the process of participating in productive labor. The principles that there is no life without labor, and no mental labor without physical labor, have specific content in my mind, and are no longer empty words. I have also developed feelings for the objects of labor and the fruits of labor, and naturally my feelings for the working people have also changed. Therefore, I have a more realistic understanding of the Party's policies and guidelines. Every policy and every call of the Party is to protect labor rights, develop production, and embody the fundamental and current interests of the working people. The Party and the working people are connected by flesh and blood. If intellectuals are unwilling to share the same fate with the working people, they will certainly not be able to share the same heart with the Party.

    The above are very superficial experiences. I sincerely hope that the committee members, friends, and teachers in the audience will give me criticism and guidance.

    In the future, I will continue to listen to the Party's words wholeheartedly under the leadership of the Party, continue to strengthen self-reform, strive for more time for labor training, and learn from the working people. I will also redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and Party documents. Actively participate in the various activities and work of the CPPCC National Committee. Completely eradicate the bourgeois standpoint, resolutely break with individualism, establish the will to share the same fate with the working people willingly, transform my thoughts and living habits, strive to return to the people's ranks as soon as possible, and further study and reform and serve the people.

    下定决心　鼓足干劲　加强改造
    李伯球委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我荣幸地参加了中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会，在这次会议上，听了陈叔通副主席所作的“工作报告”。又列席了第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，听了李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。又一次受到深刻的马克思列宁主义的教育，衷心感到鼓舞。
    这几年来，我在党的领导和教育之下、在群众监督和帮助之下，进行自我改造，参加学习、参观和短期的劳动锻炼，越来越深刻地认识自己所犯错误和罪行的严重性，愧悔无及。同时面对着社会主义建设飞跃发展的大好形势，更难忘党的伟大恩德，加之，群众热情的激励，新鲜事物的启发，使我精神焕发，改造要求愈切，信心益坚。现在就我最近通过学习参观和劳动所得的几点体会略述如下，请各位委员批评帮助。
    从学习和各地参观中，具体地体会到党和毛主席给了全国人民充沛的旺盛的生命力，党和毛主席的领导是人民昌盛、社会繁荣、国家富强的保证和一切力量的泉源。这次参观内蒙古自治区，看到内蒙古人丁昌盛，工、农、牧业的生产建设突飞猛进，人民的经济文化生活迅速改变了落后的面貌。人丁昌盛是蒙古族和少数民族一件大喜事。过去在反动统治下，蒙古族和其他少数民族人口减少趋势极为严重。他们多年来渴望着疾病消除、人丁昌盛。现在在共产党、毛主席领导下果然实现了。蒙古族人口由1946年的八十三万上升为一百一十三万。其他各族同样人口上升。牧区人民抱着娃娃欢天喜地感谢“共产党、毛主席给我送来了孩子。”内蒙古工业现已建立了初步基础。工业产值，从1949年的9.4％发展到1959年的50％。其中1958年增加幅度达到83.21％，1959年又递增57.7％。已拥有相当质量的百万职工，旧时代连手工业者都少得很的蒙古族，现在已有四万多的工人队伍。农、牧业人民公社化以后，生产大跃进，人民生活迅速提高，牧区变化更为显著。我们参观了达茂联合旗新宝勒格人民公社。1959年每人平均收入达到三百零三元，比上一年增加46％，有的户收入达一千元到两千元。建立了学校、卫生院、邮电所，并且有了五台拖拉机，三年间即将实现机械化。他们歌唱着：“草原出现新气象，牛羊肥来娃娃壮，人畜两旺多幸福，感谢恩人毛主席和共产党。”“过去内蒙古各族人民在党领导下，经过长期的斗争取得革命胜利，解放后又进行了一系列的改革，1957年和1958年上半年又进行了政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，开展了反右派斗争和反地方民族主义斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。并在新的形势下，贯彻了党的总路线，掀起了大跃进运动和农村人民公社化运动，出现了空前的大跃进局面。总之，内蒙古人民的一切胜利都是在党和毛主席领导下，贯串着阶级斗争而取得的。
    党的领导是战无不胜、攻无不克的统帅，一秒钟也不能离开党的领导和削弱党的领导，这是一条根本规律。违反这一条就要犯大错误和失败。整个时代的历史事件都充分证明这条规律是不能违反的。可是我恰恰就严重地违反了这一条规律。到底是为了什么呢？这是我反复考问自己的问题。前些时我作的答案是：第一，从资产阶级个人主义出发去对待党的关系，口头上拥护党，实际上追求个人名位；第二，早年投身于中间路线，改良主义毒素很深，一向又没有作自觉的根本改造；第三，站在资产阶级立场，假借马克思列宁主义，曲解党的政策。有了这几条，到了政治战线和思想战线上两条道路斗争尖锐的关头，即牢牢地站在资产阶级反动立场，暴露出个人主义丑恶面目，同党的领导对抗了。近来由于学习党八届八中全会文件和结合参观，社会主义事业一日千里的形势给我做了镜子，使我更看清楚过去自己同党的关系。资产阶级个人主义立场本质上是同党的立场对抗的，不接受改造，就一定要在社会主义革命更深刻发展的形势下面越来越不能相容。不仅如此，我还背上沉重的包袱，自居进步，看不起基层的工农干部，在工作中对有工作有关的干部亦常常在内心潜伏着不服气，这种不服气实质上是对无产阶级专政的反抗。同时又自恃有党的信任，以为永远不会犯政治错误，但是事实恰恰相反，反动的本质一定要暴露。到了经济上的社会主义改造胜利，基本上改变了资本主义生产关系的时候，就猖狂地要从政治上思想上争资本主义的“自由”“民主”。以为资本主义向社会主义过渡形式多样化，是一个新的形势，在中国阶级斗争结束了，资产阶级知识分子可以保留政治上更多的自由，因为党要动员他们的积极性，企图抓起这些政治资本，同党的干部较量。这一来正好同党领导下向前猛进的社会主义革命运动相对抗。要冲破资本主义残余的劳动大军势如雷霆万钧，自然要碰得头破血流。现在想起来还要胆战心惊。但是思想上越认清楚越感到幸运得到党的挽救。党对我的教育和无微不至的关心，是起死回生的太阳和春风。我能够获得改造，在毛泽东时代做一个普通劳动者，过真实的人生，是万分荣幸的。
    在各地参观，到处都看见劳动人民在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗指引下，大搞群众运动，劳动创造的智慧无穷无尽，一浪高一浪，奔腾澎湃的气势是不可遏抑的。去年参观河南安阳，群众大炼钢铁和大办工业，由小到大、由土到洋的成就，异常辉煌。其中有由三个人干起来，发展到一千二百人的钢铁企业。这次在内蒙古参观同样看见大、中、小并举、土洋并举使工业突飞猛进。技术革新和技术革命的群众比去年的劲头更高。呼和浩特市，有一个仅仅十二个职工的电映机械修配厂，大跃进时期改为制造厂，去年已试制成功十余种新产品，今年正在设计和试制高级尖端项目。如宽银幕扩大机，宽银幕磁性还音头，新型移动放映机等。全厂已有职工九十四人，85％是青年徒工，大搞技术革新、技术革命。他们说：
  “我们受到过一些右倾思想的嘲笑和阻挠；但是最终胜利的不是他们，而总是党领导下敢想敢干的人们。”这是多么豪迈。包钢的技术革新技术革命运动规模更大，成绩也更惊人。设计水平本来很高，但经过群众大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，自动化水平提得更高，而且创造新技术的多是青年工人。
    包钢白云鄂博矿区，现在是拥有电力自动的机械装备，即将建成的矿场。在草原上建起一座二万五千多人口的新城市。但是初来勘探的工作队，却是在辽阔而荒漠草原，同自然作艰苦斗争，无水可饮，只有以雪当水，出门即要迷路。他们靠着党、靠着毛泽东思想的武装、靠着群众战胜了一切困难。今天公路、铁路、邮电网，四通八达，电灯闪耀，红旗飘扬，天苍苍野茫茫的草原添上光辉的云彩。
     饮水思源，使我联想到全国千千万万这样光辉的业绩，千千万万不怕任何困难、千方百计为党完成任务的干部，党指向那里就奔向那里，那是多么崇高的共产主义风格，多么可敬、多么可爱。
    从大跃进以来全国人民的冲天干劲和一个高潮接着一个高潮的群众运动，是全民生产运动，是全民劳动大协作、工农大协作运动，是全民的文化革命、技术革命运动。知识分子为工农服务是唯一的光荣的道路，在这个形势下更加明显了。但是，我过去的思想行动恰恰与此相反。口头承认劳动创造世界，心里却怀着知识分子优越感，看不起体力劳动、看不起劳动人民，并且把知识技术看作个人资本。抽象地承认历史是人民群众创造的，而实际上脱离群众，站在群众上面，指手划脚。这种种可耻的剥削阶级反动思想是同工人阶级专政、同劳动统治的政治生活和社会生活时时发生抵触的。两年来在学习、改造中虽已不断的对自己种种错误思想进行批判，并得到领导、群众和许多朋友、老师的帮助，逐步使我认识错误。可是根底没有铲除，毒草就时常会冒出苗头，在这里刚刚卸下的包袱，在另一个场合又背上了。自以为是，不虚心听群众意见的态度，还是阻塞自己改造的障碍。一向把知识分子要深入群众同工农相结合这一知识分子劳动化的道路，理解为通过知识分子来综合和提高工农的劳动经验。这就是说，知识分子是工农的老师，而不是向工农学习。这种本末颠倒显而易见的错误，亦直到学习党八届八中全会文件，并结合参观、劳动看了许多活生生的事实才使我纠正过来。除恶务尽，我立定决心鼓足干劲，加强改造。
    我从参加生产劳动过程逐渐改变了对劳动的态度。没有劳动就没有生活，没有体力劳动就没有脑力劳动这些道理，在我思想上有了具体的内容，不是空洞的口头语了。对于劳动对象、劳动成果也发生了感情，自然对劳动人民的感情也发生变化，因此对党的政策方针有比较真实的体会。党每一项政策，每一个号召都是为了保障劳动权利，发展生产，体现劳动人民的根本利益和当前利益的。党和劳动人民是骨肉相关心连心的。如果知识分子不甘心情愿同劳动人民同命运，那就一定不能同党一条心。
    以上很肤浅的体会。恳切希望各位委员、座中的朋友、老师给我批评指正。
    今后当继续在党领导下，一心一意听党的话，继续加强自我改造，争取更多时间的劳动锻炼，向劳动人民学习。并当加倍努力学习毛主席著作和党的文件。积极参加政协全委会的各项活动和工作。彻底破灭资产阶级立场，坚决同个人主义决裂，立定甘心情愿同劳动人民同命运的志愿，改造思想和生活习惯，争取早日回到人民队伍，进一步学习改造和为人民服务。
