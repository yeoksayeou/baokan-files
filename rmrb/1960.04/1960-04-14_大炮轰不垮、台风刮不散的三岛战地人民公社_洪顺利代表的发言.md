Comrades,

The Three-Island Battlefield People's Commune That Cannot Be Destroyed by Cannon Fire or Blown Away by Typhoons

Speech by Representative Hong Shunli

Chairman, esteemed representatives:

I fully endorse the two reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. I guarantee that I will resolutely implement the great task of continuing the Great Leap Forward this year, as proposed in the reports, in my own position.

I come from the Three-Island Battlefield People's Commune on the Fujian Front. Our commune's three islands, Da Deng, Xiao Deng, and Jiao Yu, are located on the front line of the struggle against the enemy, with the closest point to the enemy-occupied Jinmen Island being only 2,500 meters away. The struggle against the enemy is extremely acute. However, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune and the "everyone is a soldier" combat organization, we have not only effectively coordinated with the People's Liberation Army to severely strike the enemy, but have also consistently adhered to "building while fighting" and developing production and construction under intense artillery fire. Our approach is: "fight big, do small; fight small, do big; don't fight, do vigorously"; "disperse for production during the day, concentrate for shock work at night"; "cultivate the rear during the day, attack the front at night." With this set of combat-style production experiences, our front-line People's Commune has been able to achieve great successes in continuous Great Leaps Forward, just like the rest of the country.

In our area, we must not only persist in the struggle against the enemy, but also use the same fighting spirit to resist severe natural disasters. August 23, 1958, when our army shelled Jinmen to punish the enemy's military provocations, was the time our People's Commune was born. And from August 23, 1958, our commune has grown and strengthened by overcoming three consecutive typhoons. We deeply feel that without the powerful and unparalleled vitality of the People's Commune, we would not be able to withstand the attack of a strong typhoon unseen in forty-three years. Last year, a typhoon of force 12 or above brought heavy rain and tidal disasters. It uprooted hundred-year-old trees, destroyed large areas of houses, washed away seawalls, submerged crops, and overturned dozens of tons of large ships. Even the enemy's Jeeps and post office signs from Jinmen were blown over to our side. On our island, within an hour, more than 3,900 meters of seawall were washed away, 3,845 salt pans were destroyed (accounting for 56% of the total), 90% of the oyster seedlings were blown down, and 51 of the 95 ships were destroyed.

If such a wind disaster had occurred before liberation, it would have certainly caused a major disaster for the people on the island, resulting in abandoned fields, broken families, and displacement. However, now that we have the strong leadership of the Party, the protection and strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the powerful People's Commune, and the masses who have been tempered through prolonged struggle, we have enough strength to overcome difficulties and defeat disasters. We implemented full island mobilization, prepared for disaster relief before the typhoon arrived, and when the typhoon arrived, the troops dispatched warships for emergency rescue. With the support of the troops, we adopted large-scale troop operations, concentrating more than 1,200 militiamen, braving the wind to repair seawalls, and in seven days, completed more than 13,000 cubic meters of earthwork and more than 2,500 cubic meters of stonework, achieving "raise the dyke two feet for every foot the tide rises". Immediately afterwards, we carried out drainage, repaired salt pans and ships, not only repairing all the ships, but also transforming old ships into new ships, small ships into large ships, and increasing the total tonnage by 30 tons. Oyster seedlings were also quickly supported. In just over a month, production was booming again. After the disaster, the masses automatically proposed to temporarily not receive wages. A few people had pessimistic ideas, believing that after such severe damage, it would take the first year to repair, the second year to restore production, and the third year to see benefits. But we issued half pay in the second month and full pay in the third month. At the end of the year, the total income of the commune reached 1.58 million yuan, an increase of 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958, with an average income of 388 yuan per worker and an average of 130 yuan per capita. The masses said well: "The people have the power to reverse the situation, seeing new villages instead of disaster scars." In times of difficulty, a well-off middle peasant once said: "In such a disaster, it is better for everyone to take care of themselves." But when I asked him about it a month later, he couldn't say anything.

In this way, we defeated the enemy's artillery fire and also defeated the typhoon. Our various productions have achieved extraordinary harvests. In particular, before liberation, the grain produced on our island was only enough to eat for two months. Last year, under such a disaster, the grain we produced was enough to eat for more than eight months. This year, we will achieve grain self-sufficiency with a surplus. We will not only develop agriculture, fishery, and transportation, but also vigorously carry out industrial construction and technical innovation and technical revolution, just like the rest of the country. This year, we will realize the mechanization of transportation by tug and barge, the mechanization and navigation of fisheries, and the semi-mechanization of agriculture. This year, we will expand the agricultural tool factory and the shipyard, and vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of salt production, establishing 53 calcium chloride factories and potassium magnesium fertilizer factories. Next year, we will build power plants and chemical plants. It doesn't matter if the enemy shells us; shelling has its own methods. And we will always have a time when the enemy cannot shell us.

In short, our lives are getting better and better. The people of our three islands are advancing in victory. The enemy's rumors and slanders that the Communist Party is not good, the People's Commune is not good, and the people on the mainland are not full, etc., really make us feel both angry and amused. Woman Huang Yihua said: "It's a pity that we are still a little far from Jinmen, otherwise I would take my children to the front line to eat, so that Chiang Kai-shek can see what we are eating!" Last June, He Yechen, a sergeant squad leader in the Chiang army, swam over to surrender to me, saying that the soldiers over there are not full, eating two meals a day, with only eight peanuts as a vegetable for each meal. He said that many Chiang army soldiers in Jinmen want to come over. That's very good; we welcome them.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have been given a clear direction for advancement. The continuous Great Leap Forward of the people of the whole country has given us tremendous encouragement, and the support and help of the People's Liberation Army has added to our strength. Therefore, the enemy's frantic artillery fire cannot destroy our commune, and the severe typhoon disasters cannot stop our leaping forward pace. On the contrary, we have grown up under the enemy's artillery fire and grown stronger in the fight against natural disasters. However, this is just the beginning. We must never be complacent or satisfied. We must continue to work hard, not only to build the three islands into an iron fortress guarding the gateway to the motherland, but also to build the three islands into a happy paradise.

### 大炮轰不垮、台风刮不散的三岛战地人民公社  洪顺利代表的发言

    大炮轰不垮、台风刮不散的三岛战地人民公社
    洪顺利代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两个报告，报告中所提出的今年继续大跃进的伟大任务，我保证在自己的岗位上坚决贯彻执行。
    我是来自福建前线的三岛战地人民公社。我们公社的大嶝、小嶝、角屿三岛，处在对敌斗争的前沿，离敌人盘踞的金门岛，最近的地方只有两千五百米，对敌斗争十分尖锐。但是，依靠人民公社的无比优越性和“全民皆兵”的战斗组织，我们不但有力地配合人民解放军狠狠打击了敌人，而且始终都在猛烈的炮火下，坚持“边打边建”，发展生产建设。我们的办法是：“大打小干、小打大干、不打猛干”，“白天分散生产，晚上集中突击”，“白天耕种后沿，晚上突击前沿”。有了这一套战斗式的生产经验，我们前线的人民公社就能够跟全国各地一样，在连续大跃进中不断取得了巨大的成绩。
    在我们那里，不但要坚持对敌斗争，而且要用同样的战斗精神，来抗击严重的自然灾害。1958年8月23日，我军为了惩罚敌人的军事挑衅，对金门炮击之时，正是我们人民公社诞生的时候；而从1958年8月23日起，我们的公社又在战胜连续三次的狂风暴雨中得到了成长、壮大。我们深深感到：如果没有人民公社的强大无比的生命力，我们是挡不住受不了四十三年来所未有的强台风袭击。去年十二级以上的狂风带来了暴雨和大潮的灾害。它把百年大树连根拔起，捣毁大片房屋，冲垮海堤，淹没庄稼，数十吨的大船被吹翻，连金门敌人的吉普车、邮局招牌也被刮到我们这边来。在我们的岛上，一个小时之内，海堤被冲垮三千九百多米，盐坎冲毁三千八百四十五坎（占总数56％）海蛎苗刮倒90％，九十五条船毁坏了五十一条。
    像这样的风灾，如果发生在解放前，一定会给岛上的人民造成田园荒废，家破人亡，流离失所的大灾难。但是，现在我们有党的坚强领导，有解放军的保卫与有力援助，有强大的人民公社，有久经斗争锻炼的群众，我们就有足够的力量，克服困难，战胜灾害。我们实行全岛动员，在台风到来之前，作好抗灾准备，台风到来时部队派舰艇进行紧急抢救，又在部队支援下，采取大兵团作战，集中了民兵一千二百多人，冒风抢修海堤，七天的时间，就做了一万三千多土方，二千五百多石方，做到“潮涨一尺，堤高两尺”。紧接着又进行排水，修盐坎和船只，不但全部船只修好，而且旧船变新船，小船变大船，总吨数还增加三十吨，海蛎苗也都很快扶植起来。不过一个多月，生产上又蓬蓬勃勃。灾后群众自动提出暂时不领工资，有少数人产生悲观思想，认为遭受这样严重的破坏，要经过第一年修整，第二年恢复生产，第三年才会有收益。可是我们第二个月就发半薪，第三个月就发了全薪，到年终结算，全年公社收入达到一百五十八万元，比大跃进的1958年还增加40％，平均每个劳动力收入三百八十八元，按人口计算平均每人也有一百三十元。群众说得好：“人民自有回天力，不见灾痕见新村”。在困难时，有个富裕中农曾经说：“在这样的灾荒下，还是各顾各的罢”。但等到一个多月以后，我再问他怎么样，把他问得说不出话来。
    就这样，我们战胜了敌人的炮火，也战胜了台风。我们各项生产都获得了特大丰收。特别是解放前我们岛上生产的粮食只够吃两个月，去年那样的灾害下，我们生产的粮食够吃八个多月，今年我们就要做到粮食自给还有余。我们不但要发展农业、渔业和运输业，而且要和全国各地一样大搞工业建设，大搞技术革新、技术革命。我们今年要实现运输拖驳化、渔业机航化、农业半机械化。今年要扩建农具厂，造船厂，并大搞盐业生产的综合利用，兴办五十三个氯化钙厂和钾镁肥厂。明年要建发电厂和化工厂。敌人打炮不要紧，打炮有打炮的搞法。而且我们总有使敌人打不了炮的时候。
    总之，我们的日子越过越好，我们三岛人民在胜利中前进。敌人造谣污蔑共产党不好、人民公社不好，大陆人民吃不饱等等真是叫我们感到又好气又好笑。妇女黄艺花说：“可惜我们离金门还远了一点，不然我就带着孩子到前线去吃饭，让蒋介石看看我们吃的是什么！”去年6月间蒋军中士班长贺业臣，泅水过来向我投诚，说那边兵士都吃不饱，一天吃两顿，每顿只有八颗花生米当菜。他说金门有很多蒋军士兵都想过来。这很好，我们欢迎。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，给我们指明了前进的方向，全国人民的连续大跃进给了我们巨大的鼓舞，人民解放军的支援和帮助，又给我们增添了力量。因此，敌人疯狂的炮火打不垮我们的公社，严重的台风灾害阻挡不住我们跃进的步伐，相反的我们在敌人的炮火下成长起来，在抗击自然灾害中得到壮大。但是，这还只是开始，我们决不麻痹不自满，我们一定要继续努力，不但要把三岛建成守卫祖国大门的一座钢铁堡垒，而且要把三岛建成一座幸福的乐园。
