Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Comrade He Long, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at the National Militia Representatives Conference. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades!

    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I extend my warmest congratulations to you, to the National Militia Representatives Conference, and to the hundreds of millions of male and female militia comrades across the country.

    In the long revolutionary war, our militia supported and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army, defeated powerful class enemies at home and abroad, and made great contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. In the ten years since the founding of the country, the broad masses of the militia have played a tremendous positive role in the struggle to eliminate bandits, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, carry out land reform, suppress counter-revolutionaries, consolidate land and sea borders, restore and develop the national economy, and in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In particular, since the large-scale establishment of militia divisions in 1958, the broad masses of the militia, implementing militarized organization, combat-oriented action, collectivized living, and democratized management, have not only become a strong force in defending the motherland, but also a shock brigade and main force in accelerating our socialist construction.

    The large-scale establishment of militia divisions is, on the one hand, to deal with the war threats and military provocations of U.S. imperialism; on the other hand, it is also the inevitable product of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the organization of the militia division is "a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization." This combines economic construction and national defense construction. In the past two years, the activities of the broad masses of the militia on all fronts of socialist construction have been very active. Because the militia has a tenacious fighting style, a daring and capable creative spirit, and a high degree of organization and discipline, they are best at completing shock tasks and most convenient for organizing large-scale operations. They respond most actively to the call of the Party. Wherever the task is most arduous, most difficult, and most dangerous, they and the broad masses of the people rush to that location.

    The large-scale establishment of militia divisions has further strengthened national defense construction. Because the broad countryside and urban factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools in our country have universally established militia divisions and regiments, and because of the widespread development of national defense sports, the reserve force of modern national defense has been greatly enhanced. The armed people are even more high-spirited, closely cooperating with the People's Liberation Army, resolutely defending the construction of the motherland, and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    The Party Central Committee and the State Council warmly congratulate our militia on their brilliant achievements. These achievements are the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In the long revolutionary war, and in our country's economic construction and national defense construction, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied and developed the Marxist-Leninist thought of arming the people. For more than 30 years, our militia has been advancing from victory to victory along the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the future, we must hold even higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely.

    Now, our socialist construction cause has entered a new stage. The situation of our national economy's sustained leap forward at both high speed and in proportion has been established. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country are striving to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and to strive for a comprehensive, better, and sustained leap forward in our country's socialist construction. In order to accelerate our country's socialist construction, comrades must exert greater revolutionary energy and actively participate in production and construction. The national militia is a powerful socialist industrial army in production and construction. In peacetime, all activities of the militia should take production as the key link. People are the most active and positive factor in the productive forces. Widely mobilizing hundreds of millions of militia, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the militia, is of great significance for accelerating socialist construction. While actively participating in production and construction, we must always be vigilant against the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. We must use all gaps, actively study military affairs, politics, and science and culture, participate in national defense sports activities, strengthen our physique, and increase our ability to build and defend the motherland. We are a socialist country, we love peace, and we advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Our social system stipulates that we will not invade an inch of other people's territory. We eagerly hope for a very long-term peaceful environment to build socialism. However, when U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, when U.S. imperialism is intensifying its arms expansion and war preparations, expanding military bases around us, and vigorously supporting the resurgence of Japanese militarism, we must not lose the slightest vigilance and relax the necessary precautions. We must strengthen the modernization of the People's Liberation Army and strengthen the construction of the militia to prepare for a war of aggression against imperialism. If imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, it must be submerged in the vast ocean of all the people being soldiers in our country.

    Our militia has a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Party Central Committee and the State Council firmly believe that you will surely make greater contributions in the great cause of building and defending the motherland in the future. Now, our country is full of vitality and prosperity everywhere, and our beautiful prospects are becoming more and more brilliant. I hope that you will always follow the teachings of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, guard against arrogance and rashness, unite with the broad masses of the people, hold high the three bright red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and modern national defense as soon as possible.

    I wish the conference success.

    贺龙代表中共中央国务院致祝词
    新华社18日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理贺龙元帅在全国民兵代表会议上代表中共中央、国务院致祝词，全文如下：同志们：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会、国务院，向你们，向全国民兵代表会议，并向全国亿万男女民兵同志们致以最热烈的祝贺。
    我国民兵，在长期革命战争中，支援和配合人民解放军，打败了国内外强大的阶级敌人，对中国人民的解放事业作出了巨大贡献。建国十年来，广大民兵，在肃清残匪、抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、巩固陆海边防的斗争中，在恢复和发展国民经济中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，都发挥了巨大的积极作用。特别是1958年大办民兵师以来，实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化的广大民兵，不仅已经成为保卫祖国的坚强力量，而且已经成为加速我国社会主义建设的突击队和主力军。
    大办民兵师，一方面是为了对付美帝国主义的战争威胁和军事挑衅；另一方面，也是大跃进和人民公社运动的必然产物。民兵师的组织，正如毛泽东同志所说的：“这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”这就把经济建设和国防建设结合起来。两年来，广大民兵在社会主义建设各个战线上的活动都非常活跃。由于民兵具有顽强的战斗作风，敢想敢干的创造精神和较高的组织性、纪律性，因而，他们最善于完成突击任务，最便于组织大兵团作战；他们响应党的号召最积极，哪里任务最艰巨、最困难、最危险，他们就和广大人民在一起奔向哪里。
    大办民兵师，进一步加强了国防建设。由于我国广大农村和城市的厂矿、企业、机关、学校都普遍建立了民兵师团，由于国防体育运动的广泛开展，就大大增强了现代国防的后备力量。武装起来的人民，更加意气风发，密切配合人民解放军，坚决地保卫祖国的建设，保卫远东和世界和平。
    党中央和国务院热烈祝贺我国民兵的辉煌成就。这些成就，是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。毛泽东同志在长期的革命战争中，在我国的经济建设和国防建设中，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义武装人民的思想。三十多年来，我国民兵就是沿着毛泽东同志所指示的道路，从胜利走向胜利。今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进。
    现在，我国社会主义建设事业，已经进入了一个新的阶段。我国国民经济既高速度、又按比例的持续跃进的局面，已经奠定。全国人民在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正在为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要，为争取我国社会主义建设全面的更好的持续跃进而奋斗。为了加速我国的社会主义建设，同志们一定要发挥更大的革命干劲，积极参加生产建设。全国民兵是生产建设上强大的社会主义产业军。在和平时期，民兵的一切活动都应以生产为纲。人是生产力的最活跃、最积极的因素，广泛地动员亿万民兵，充分发挥民兵的积极性和创造性，对于加速社会主义建设有着非常重大的意义。在积极参加生产建设中，还要时刻警惕美帝国主义的战争阴谋，要利用一切空隙，积极学习军事、政治和科学文化，参加国防体育活动，锻炼体质，增长建设祖国和保卫祖国的本领。我们是社会主义国家，我们热爱和平，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，我们的社会制度规定了我们不会去侵占别人的一寸领土，我们热切地希望有一个很长期的和平环境来建设社会主义。但是，当着美帝国主义还侵占我国领土台湾的时候，当着美帝国主义加紧扩军备战，在我们身边扩大军事基地，并且极力扶持日本军国主义再起的时候，我们绝不能丧失丝毫的警惕和放松应有的戒备。我们必须在加强人民解放军现代化的同时，加强民兵的建设，作好防御帝国主义侵略战争的准备。如果帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，就一定要使它们淹没在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。
    我国民兵有着光荣的革命传统。党中央和国务院坚信：你们在今后建设祖国、保卫祖国的伟大事业中，一定能作出更大的贡献。现在，我国到处是生气勃勃的繁荣景象，我们美好的前景越来越光辉灿烂。希望你们永远遵循党和毛泽东同志的教导，戒骄戒躁，与广大人民团结一致，高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面鲜明的红旗，尽快地把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国。
    祝大会成功。（附图片）
