Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd – Since its establishment more than a year ago, the Jianxin People's Commune in Anqing City, Anhui Province, which is mainly composed of street residents, has witnessed tremendous changes in the political and ideological outlook, culture, and skills of all women in the commune. Before the establishment of the commune, there was not a single Party member and only one League member among the housewives in the entire commune. Now, twenty women have been admitted into the Communist Party, sixty-five young women have been admitted into the Communist Youth League, and a large number of advanced workers have emerged.
    The Jianxin People's Commune was established at the end of 1958. Housewives account for more than 75% of the members, and more than 1,000 of them participate in commune-run industrial production.
    Since its establishment, the commune, adhering to the principle of serving large-scale industry, serving the countryside, serving the lives of urban people, and serving exports, has established various factories that are relatively simple in technology, require less physical labor, and are easy to “launch,” such as feather fan factories, canvas product factories, cattail bag factories, sanitary product factories, chemical factories, and fiberglass factories. In the past year or so, the commune has established 21 factories, producing 169 kinds of products. More than 1,000 housewives working in these factories have learned a skill, and generally reached the level of a Grade 2 worker. Ma Zixia, a housewife, only joined the feather fan factory at the end of last year. In the three months since joining the factory, she has reached the technical level of a Grade 2 worker due to her diligent study. The 142 female workers in the canvas product factory launched a Red Banner Hand and Clever Girl movement in technological innovation, reforming tools and improving operation methods 206 times in more than two months, changing all 65 sewing machines and canvas machines in the factory from foot-operated to electric, and improving the three-needle sewing machine. Now the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the factory has greatly improved compared to the past. The male workers in this factory praised them, saying: "Innovation flowers bloom everywhere, Red Banner Girls are praised by everyone, who says women can't do it, our factory is full of innovators."
    After participating in production and social work, housewives have greatly improved their enthusiasm for learning politics, culture, and technology. The commune has established one spare-time Party school and one spare-time League school, as well as twelve Red and Expert schools, fifteen cultural schools, and one accounting and statistics middle school. Two hundred and seventy-six Party members, League members, and mass activists have studied in the two-month-long spare-time Party school, including 229 housewives. Six hundred Communist Youth League members and young people have participated in the study of spare-time League schools, including 320 women. Before the establishment of the commune, there were 1,215 illiterate and semi-illiterate housewives in the entire commune. Now their Chinese language level has all reached above the primary school level, including 61 women who have changed from illiterate to having a junior high school Chinese language level, and 242 who have a senior primary school Chinese language level. Ma Huailian, a family member of a porter, worked actively after joining the commune. When the commune promoted her to be the director of the Women's Federation, some male cadres thought that she was illiterate and could not be competent for this work. She herself also realized that she could not do her job well without culture, so she insisted on studying every night without interruption, and also brought textbooks, paper and pens with her during the day, reviewing whenever she had free time during work. As a result of her hard study for more than a year, she can now write simple work summaries, reaching the cultural level of junior high school, and was elected as the deputy director of the commune, gloriously joining the Communist Party of China. Ju Weiqing, the mother of four children, did not participate in literacy studies in the past because she had too many children. After the establishment of the commune, she was freed from the burden of children due to the establishment of collective welfare undertakings, participated in the study, and now has a high primary school Chinese language level, able to read newspapers and write notices.
    After housewives participate in production and work, their family and social status have been improved. The situation of being completely economically dependent on their husbands has also been completely changed. At the end of 1959, the average wage of women among the commune's employees was 20.99 yuan. The husband of Lan Yunxia, a worker in the feather fan factory, works as a clerk in the Municipal Grain Bureau. Originally, his monthly income was not enough to maintain the family life. After the establishment of the commune, Lan Yunxia and her daughter entered the factory, and their monthly income was 40 yuan. Now the whole family still has savings every month. Before liberation, Ma Jirong was a child bride and was looked down upon by her husband and mother-in-law. After liberation, the relationship between husband and wife and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was still not harmonious. After the establishment of the commune, Ma Jirong worked and studied actively in the feather fan factory, and was promoted to workshop director and deputy factory director, and was admitted into the Party. Now her mother-in-law and husband respect her very much, and her mother-in-law also takes the initiative to help her take care of the children. When Ma Jirong is busy with work, her mother-in-law personally delivers food to the factory for her to eat. Last year, the entire commune developed 27 Party members, 20 of whom were housewives, and 65 of the 108 Communist Youth League members developed were housewives. Among the 102 full-time cadres in the entire commune, 59 were housewives, including one female deputy director of the commune, 17 deputy factory directors, and 29 workshop directors. A large number of activists and advanced workers have emerged. There are 105 female pacesetters, 232 advanced producers, 33 various models, 185 Red Banner Hands, and 54 socialist construction activists in the entire commune. The full-time nursery they run won the national "March 8th" Red Banner collective title.

    城市人民公社给家庭妇女增长了才干
    建新公社妇女全面跃进
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽省安庆市以街道居民为主组成的建新人民公社，建社一年多来，全社妇女的政治思想面貌、文化、技术等方面都发生了巨大的变化。公社成立前，全社家庭妇女中没有一个党员，只有一名团员。现在已有二十名妇女被吸收加入共产党，六十五名青年妇女被吸收加入共青团，还涌现出大批先进工作者。
    建新人民公社是1958年年底成立的，社员中，家庭妇女占75％以上，其中参加社办工业生产的有一千多人。
    公社成立以后，本着为大工业服务、为农村服务、为城市人民生活和出口服务的方针，举办了技术比较简单、体力劳动较轻、又容易“上马”的各种工厂，如羽毛扇厂、帆布制品厂、蒲包厂、卫生用品厂、化工厂、玻璃纤维厂等。一年多来公社已办了二十一个厂，生产一百六十九种产品。在这些工厂里工作的一千多名家庭妇女，都学会了一种技术，一般都达到了二级工的水平。家庭妇女马自霞去年年底才进羽毛扇厂，进厂三个月来，由于她刻苦钻研，已经达到二级工的技术水平。帆布制品厂的一百四十二个女工，在技术革新中开展红旗手、巧姑娘运动，两个多月中改革工具、改进操作方法二百零六项，使全厂六十五部缝纫机、帆布机由脚踏改为电动，并改进了三针缝纫机，现在全厂机械化半机械化的水平比过去大大提高。这个厂的男工赞扬她们说：“革新花儿处处开，红旗姑娘人人赞，谁说妇女不能干，我厂全是革新家。”
    家庭妇女们参加生产和社会工作以后，学习政治、文化、技术的积极性大大提高了。这个公社举办了业余党校和业余团校各一所，还举办了十二所红专学校，十五所文化学校和一所会计、统计中学。已经有二百七十六个党员、团员和群众积极分子在两个月一期的业余党校中学习过，其中家庭妇女就有二百二十九人。有六百个共青团员和青年参加了业余团校的学习，其中妇女有三百二十人。公社成立前，全社家庭妇女中文盲、半文盲有一千二百一十五人，现在她们的语文程度已全部达到初小以上水平，其中由文盲变为具有初中语文程度的妇女六十一名，高小语文程度的二百四十二名。搬运工人家属马怀莲，入社后工作积极，公社提拔她当妇联主任时，部分男干部认为她是文盲不能胜任这个工作，她自己也认识到没有文化不能做好工作，就每天晚上坚持学习，从不间断，白天也把课本、纸笔带在身边，工作中一有空闲就复习。他苦学一年多的结果，现在已能写简单的工作总结，达到初中文化水平，并被选为公社副社长，光荣地参加了中国共产党。四个孩子的母亲居为清，过去因为孩子多，没有参加扫盲学习，公社成立后由于举办了集体福利事业，摆脱孩子的牵累，参加了学习，现已具有高小的语文程度，能看报纸、写通知。
    家庭妇女参加生产和工作后，家庭地位和社会地位都提高了。经济上完全依靠丈夫的情况也已彻底改变。1959年底，全社职工中妇女的平均工资为二十点九九元。羽毛扇厂工人兰云霞的丈夫在市粮食局任办事员，原来每月收入不够维持家庭生活，公社成立后，兰云霞母女二人进了工厂，两人每月收入四十元，现在全家每月还有储蓄。家庭妇女马吉荣，解放前是童养媳，丈夫和婆婆都看不起她。解放后夫妻、婆媳之间仍不融洽，公社成立后，马吉荣在羽毛扇厂积极工作和学习，先后被提拔为车间主任、副厂长，并被吸收入党，现在婆婆和丈夫都很尊重她，婆婆也主动帮助她带孩子，马吉荣工作忙的时候，婆婆还亲自把饭送到工厂去给她吃。去年全公社发展了二十七个党员，有二十名是家庭妇女，发展的一百零八个共青团员中有六十五名是家庭妇女。全公社一百零二个脱产干部中，家庭妇女有五十九名，其中女副社长一名，副厂长十七名，车间主任二十九名。涌现了大批的积极分子和先进工作者，全社有女标兵一百零五名、先进生产者二百三十二名，各种模范三十三名，红旗手一百八十五名，社会主义建设积极分子五十四名。他们办的全托托儿所荣获全国“三八”红旗集体称号。
