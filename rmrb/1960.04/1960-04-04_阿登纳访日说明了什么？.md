Adenauer, the West German Chancellor, has concluded his eight-day visit to Japan. Although both West Germany and Japan have been secretive about the content of the Adenauer-Kishi Nobusuke talks, and their joint statement is full of high-sounding phrases, it is not difficult to see from the materials that have been revealed that Adenauer's trip to Japan marks the open collusion between the West German and Japanese militarist forces fostered by the United States after the war, and is another concrete step in the United States' policy of creating tension and preparing for a new war.

The joint statement issued by Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke vigorously advocated that the "common goal of the policies of the two countries, West Germany and Japan, is to achieve lasting peace on the basis of freedom and justice." Adenauer, the successor of German militarism, who twice launched world wars in the first half of this century, and Kishi Nobusuke, the representative of Japanese militarist forces, who launched successive armed invasions in the East for half a century, actually talked about "freedom," "justice," and "peace," which cannot but be a great irony to these terms. Anyone slightly familiar with modern history knows that West German and Japanese militarism's so-called "freedom" is nothing more than their freedom to expand their armaments and prepare for war, their freedom to "seize living space by force," and their freedom to establish their "lifeline" on the territories of other countries; West German and Japanese militarism's so-called "justice" only refers to the crematoria of the Maidaneck and Buchenwald concentration camps, the massacres of Coventry, Nanjing, and Singapore, the Chongqing bombing, the "three-all" policy in various parts of North China, and countless heinous crimes they committed in the lands of Europe, China, and Southeast Asian countries. And the "peace" sought by West German and Japanese militarism, like that of U.S. imperialism, is the "peace" of eliminating socialism and enslaving the people of the world.

Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke stated in the joint statement as if they were serious that West Germany and Japan advocated that all international disputes should be resolved through consultation; welcomed efforts to ease the situation between East and West; mentioned the importance of supervised reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons; and believed that the German and Berlin issues should be resolved in accordance with the right to national self-determination stipulated in the United Nations Charter. However, it was none other than Adenauer himself, who issued this joint statement, who had obtained assurances from his talks with U.S. President Eisenhower before starting his trip to Japan: the West would adopt a stubborn attitude at the summit meeting, continue to insist on unifying Germany by annexing the German Democratic Republic to West Germany, and try to prevent the normalization of the situation in West Berlin and continue to maintain the Western military occupation of West Berlin. During his visit to Japan, he even greatly promoted that the West "must not allow itself to be deceived by talk of easing tensions"; before formulating a "safe" disarmament plan, "we must remain strong" and must not abandon nuclear weapons; West Germany and Japan must step up their arms expansion and war preparations and should not be "satisfied with" the existing rearmament. These warmongering cries were openly "agreed" to by Kishi Nobusuke. It is also this Adenauer who emphasizes "national self-determination" who not only verbally clamors to annex the German Democratic Republic by force, but is actually preparing for "lightning attacks." The frequent provocative military exercises conducted by the West German army and the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany are all directed against the German Democratic Republic. As for the joint statement mentioning that West Germany and Japan will "strengthen cooperation" to provide economic "assistance" to underdeveloped countries, it shows that the monopoly capital of the two countries will coordinate contradictions in competing for sales markets and sources of raw materials, and collude with each other to plunder and exploit the people of various economically underdeveloped countries. The West German "General Report," which often reflects the views of the Bonn government, admitted that West Germany and Japan, which have "commonality" in domestic affairs, foreign affairs, and economic policies, are both "urgently seeking sales markets for industrial products." The total amount of West German foreign investment after the war has reached 18 to 19 billion West German marks (approximately 4.28 to 4.5 billion U.S. dollars). After occupying the main positions in the European market, West German monopoly capital has in recent years focused its main spearhead on underdeveloped areas in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, conducting economic expansion, seizing rich resources and high profits, and attempting to restore former colonial interests. The total amount of Japan's current overseas investment and loans (including those under contract but not yet implemented) has reached a post-war high of 1.217 billion U.S. dollars. In order to accelerate the pace of Japan's economic expansion in Southeast Asia, the Kishi Nobusuke group is actively planning a program for Japan to conduct "economic cooperation" with underdeveloped countries. Taizo Ishizaka, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, openly clamored that Japan should take advantage of the current "very good" economic situation and "resolutely strive to gain a foothold in the world economy."

The Adenauer-Kishi Nobusuke joint statement, with its high-sounding words, cannot conceal its aggressive essence at all. On the eve of this East-West summit meeting, when the international situation began to tend towards relaxation due to the joint efforts of the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, Adenauer's first official visit to Japan after the war, and his frenzied restoration of the past activities of the German-Japanese axis of aggression with Kishi Nobusuke, was by no means accidental. It shows that the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan, with the support of the United States, have gradually become fully fledged, so that they dare to openly collude. This is inseparable from the war policy and aggression policy of the United States. After World War II, U.S. imperialism replaced German and Japanese fascism and became the number one enemy of world peace. An important component of U.S. imperialism's strategic plan of aggression is to fully support the militarism of West Germany and Japan as two fists in the East and West for it to launch new wars. Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke have repeatedly expressed their gratitude for this "generous help" from the United States. The economic foundation of West German and Japanese militarism has been rapidly restored and developed after the war. West Germany's industrial production recovered to pre-war levels as early as 1950. Now, its industrial production level has surpassed that of Britain and France, ranking second only to the United States in the total industrial production of the capitalist world. Japan's industrial production level has now reached three times that of pre-war levels, ranking first in the capitalist world in terms of development speed. The military strength of the two countries has also been greatly strengthened. The West German army currently has a force of 250,000 men, the largest army among the European countries participating in the North Atlantic Group. Japan is expected to increase its army to 171,500 men, its navy to 115,800 tons of warships and 30,068 men, and its air force to 1,115 aircraft and 36,700 men this year. This will make the firepower and mobility of the Japanese army four times and seven times higher than the 1937 levels, respectively, and will also exceed the total current strength of countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and Malaya, which were invaded by Japanese militarism in the Pacific War. People will not easily forget the lessons of history. In 1914 and 1939, German imperialism launched two world wars, relying on its strong economic and military strength to demand a "re-division of the world by force." Japanese imperialism also relied on its strong strength to occupy Northeast China in 1931, occupy large areas of northern, eastern, central, and southern China from 1937, and occupy countries such as the Philippines, Malaya, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma from 1941. Today, with the resurgence of the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan, the activities of West German and Japanese militarists represented by Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke to expand abroad are also becoming increasingly intensified. Recently, the Adenauer government has negotiated with the Franco government to establish West German military bases in Spain, citing the need for training locations, and has also made the same requests to Portugal, Turkey, Greece, France, and Italy. Adenauer has repeatedly clamored that "Germany must be strong enough to recover lost territory"; "Unless Europe is unified, we will not be able to recover Berlin and eastern Germany." Since signing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Kishi Nobusuke has also accelerated arms expansion and war preparations, openly clamoring that the scope of application of the treaty includes the territory of the Soviet Union and China. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida clamored that "territory is not always immutable. Japan previously expanded to the edge of Manchuria, and if national strength expands day by day, territory will also expand." He does not believe that "Japanese territory will always remain as it is now." All of these are dangerous signals to the people of Europe, Asia, and the world.

However, precisely because the aggressive intentions of West German and Japanese militarism are becoming increasingly exposed, their situation is becoming more and more difficult and isolated. The reason why Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke disregarded the world's people's fresh memory of the notorious German-Japanese-Italian fascist axis concluded in 1940 and openly colluded, risking the world's condemnation, also shows how unfavorable the situation of West German and Japanese militarism is, and how eager they are to seek mutual support. During his visit to Japan, Adenauer emphasized the "common interests," "commonality," and "traditional friendship" of West Germany and Japan, and tried his best to support Kishi Nobusuke, who was facing strong opposition from the vast number of Japanese people due to the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; Kishi Nobusuke also actively supported Adenauer's attitude of undermining the summit meeting and obstructing the easing of the international situation.

Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke's activities, which run counter to the wishes of peace-loving people in all countries, are carried out under the direct instigation of the United States and directly serve the war policy and aggression policy of the United States. Everyone knows that Adenauer went to Japan after visiting the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Herter clearly stated during Adenauer's visit to the United States: It would be foolish to be too optimistic about the outcome of the summit meeting. Eisenhower also affirmed to him: "The American flag will continue to fly over Berlin." Adenauer also felt "satisfied" with this. And as soon as the joint statement of Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke was issued, the U.S. propaganda machine praised with great satisfaction that "this is a new voice in the world supporting Bonn's policies on Berlin and the unification of Germany." Adenauer's visit to Japan this time on the eve of the summit meeting was intended to "stir up and poison the international atmosphere" before the meeting. This is exactly what U.S. imperialism hopes for.

The collusion between the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan is not surprising. This is not only because they have historically colluded with each other, but also because today they are all under the control of the United States, serving as tools for the United States to promote its aggressive plans to dominate the world. The United States, after the war, did not hesitate to openly abandon international agreements such as the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Proclamation, which the world's justice and mankind had exchanged for countless blood and lives, and spared no effort to revive the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan, also for this purpose. The United States' idea is: "Germany was once a powerful military power, and the Germans are great soldiers. In the next war, we want to make the Germans stand on the side of the United States." (Statement by U.S. Democratic Congressman Thomas) "It is enough for us to supply arms, our children do not need to shed blood in Europe, there are enough Germans there to die for the interests of the United States." (Words of U.S. General Collins) As for Japan, the United States initially attempted to support it as "an assistant for the United States to ensure security in the Pacific and assist backward countries in Asia." (Report of the Rockefeller Foundation Committee) Today, the threat of war from West Germany and Japan is rooted in the war policy of U.S. imperialism. What will be the outcome of the United States' wishful thinking? People may wish to review the past history. Before World War II, Western countries helped German and Japanese imperialism, attempting to use them against the Soviet Union and other countries, and the result was: "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." U.S. imperialism is bound to suffer because it is unwilling and unable to recognize this historical lesson of lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet, and because it completely ignores the changes in the world situation after the war. The defeat of Hitler's Germany in Europe marked the beginning of a new era in Europe, and the defeat of Japanese imperialism also marked the beginning of a new era in Asia. Today, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is rising, and in West Germany and Japan, which are regarded by the United States as two pillars for it to launch aggressive wars, the struggle against the United States splitting Germany and reviving West German militarism is underway, and the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is powerful. The United States continues to support West Germany and Japan, strengthening these two sources of war danger, and will inevitably suffer the consequences.

The Chinese people have always firmly opposed the U.S.'s sinister activities of reviving West German and Japanese militarism and preparing for a new war, firmly support the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys and resolving the West Berlin issue, and firmly support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. At a time when West German and Japanese militarism, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are further colluding and seriously threatening world peace, the Chinese people will work even harder to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity with the German people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world, be a hundred times more vigilant, oppose aggression, and defend peace. We are convinced that in the face of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the powerful peace-loving forces in the world, whether it is the militarism of West Germany and Japan or U.S. imperialism, if they dare to launch a war of aggression, then it will certainly be themselves who will be completely destroyed!

### 阿登纳访日说明了什么？

    阿登纳访日说明了什么？
    西德总理阿登纳已经结束了他在日本历时八天的访问。尽管西德和日本双方对阿登纳—岸信介会谈的内容讳莫如深，在他们的联合声明中也堆满了冠冕堂皇的辞句，但是根据已透露的材料仍不难看出，阿登纳的日本之行，是美国战后一手扶植起来的西德和日本的军国主义势力进行公开勾结的标志，是美国制造紧张局势、准备新战争的政策的又一个具体步骤。
    阿登纳和岸信介发表的联合声明极力鼓吹西德和日本“两国政策的共同目标是在自由和正义的基础上实现持久和平”。一个在本世纪头五十年中两度发动世界大战的德国军国主义的继承者阿登纳，和一个在东方在半个世纪中接连发动武装侵略的日本军国主义势力的代表岸信介竟然大谈“自由”、“正义”、“和平”，不能不成为对这些名词的莫大讽刺。稍稍熟悉近代历史的人都知道：西德和日本军国主义所谓的“自由”，不过是它们扩军备战的自由，不过是它们用“武力夺取生存空间”的自由，不过是它们把自己的“生命线”建立到别国领土上去的自由；西德和日本军国主义所谓的“正义”，不过指的是玛伊丹奈克和布痕瓦尔德集中营的焚尸炉、考文特、南京、新加坡的大屠杀、重庆大轰炸、华北各地三光政策以及它们在欧洲大陆、中国和东南亚各国土地上所犯下的无数滔天罪行。而西德和日本军国主义所要的“和平”，同美帝国主义如出一辙，就是消灭社会主义的“和平”、奴役世界人民的“和平”。
    阿登纳—岸信介在联合声明中像煞有介事地表示，西德和日本主张一切国际争端应依靠协商解决；欢迎东西方之间争取缓和局势的努力；说什么有监督地裁减核武器和常规武器的重要；认为德国和柏林问题应根据联合国宪章规定的民族自决权来解决。然而，不是别人、恰恰是发表这项联合声明的阿登纳自己，在开始日本之行以前才从他同美国总统艾森豪威尔的会谈中取得保证：西方在最高级会议上将采取顽固态度，继续坚持要通过使西德吞并德意志民主共和国的办法来统一德国，并且竭力阻挠西柏林局势正常化，继续维持西方对西柏林的军事占领。在他访问日本期间，更大事宣传西方“决不可使自己受到关于紧张局势缓和的言论的欺骗”；在制定“安全”的裁军计划以前，“必须保持强大”，决不能放弃核武器；西德和日本必须加紧扩军备战，不应“满足于”现有的重整军备。这些好战叫嚷都得到岸信介的公然“同意”。也正是这位强调“民族自决”的阿登纳，不仅口头扬言要以武力吞并德意志民主共和国，实际上也确在进行“闪电袭击”的准备活动。西德军队和驻西德美军频繁举行的挑衅性军事演习，没有一次攻击方向不是针对着德意志民主共和国的。至于联合声明中提到西德和日本将“加强合作”对不发达国家进行经济“援助”，则表明两国垄断资本将协调争夺销售市场和原料来源的矛盾，互相勾结起来，对各经济不发达国家人民进行掠夺和剥削。经常反映波恩政府意见的西德“总汇报”供认，在内政、外交和经济政策上具有“共同性”的西德和日本都在“迫切地寻找工业品销售市场”。战后西德对外投资总数已达一百八十到一百九十亿西德马克（约合四十二亿八千万到四十五亿多美元）。西德垄断资本在占领了欧洲市场的主要阵地之后，近年来把它的主要矛头指向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲不发达地区，进行经济扩张，攫取丰富资源和高额利润，企图恢复从前的殖民利益。日本目前在国外的投资和贷款总额（包括已签合同尚未实施的部分）已经达到十二亿一千七百万美元的战后最高纪录。为了加快日本在东南亚进行经济扩张的步伐，岸信介集团正在积极筹划日本同不发达国家进行“经济合作”的方案。日本经济团体联合会会长石坂泰三公开叫嚣，日本要趁目前经济情况“很好”的时机，“坚决努力，在世界经济中获得地盘”。
    阿登纳—岸信介措词冠冕堂皇的联合声明，一点也掩盖不了它们的侵略本质。在这东西方最高级会议的前夕，当国际局势由于社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的共同努力开始趋向和缓的时候，阿登纳进行战后第一次对日本的正式访问，而且同岸信介一起，猖狂地恢复往日的德日侵略轴心的活动，绝不是偶然的。它说明西德和日本的军国主义势力，在美国的扶植下羽毛已渐丰满，以至敢于公开进行勾结。这同美国的战争政策和侵略政策是分不开的。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义代替了德国和日本法西斯，成为世界和平的头号敌人。美帝国主义的侵略战略计划的重要组成部分是全力扶植西德和日本的军国主义，作为它发动新战争一东一西的两个拳头。阿登纳和岸信介对于美国的这种“慷慨帮助”，曾经一再表示感激涕零。战后西德和日本军国主义的经济基础得到迅速恢复和发展。西德的工业生产早在1950年就恢复到战前水平。现在，它的工业生产水平已跑在英法前面，在资本主义世界工业生产总额中仅次于美国而占据第二位。日本的工业生产水平目前已经达到战前的三倍，发展速度在资本主义世界列居首位。两国的军事力量也有了不小的加强。西德军队现有兵力二十五万人，是参加北大西洋集团的欧洲国家中最庞大的一支军队。日本今年预计陆军将增加到十七万一千五百人，海军将增加到十一万五千八百吨军舰和三万零六十八人，空军将增加到一千一百十五架飞机和三万六千七百多人。这就使日本军队的火力和机动能力分别超过1937年水平的四倍和七倍，同时也将超过泰国、菲律宾、缅甸、马来亚这些在太平洋战争中被日本军国主义侵略过的国家的现有兵力的总和。人们是不会轻易忘掉历史教训的。1914年和1939年德国帝国主义两次发动世界大战，就是它凭借自己强大的经济和军事实力，要求“武力重新分割世界”的。日本帝国主义也同样自恃它的实力强大，在1931年侵占中国的东北，1937年起侵占中国北部东部中部南部广大地区，1941年起又侵占菲律宾、马来亚、印度尼西亚、越南、泰国、缅甸等国。今天，随着西德和日本的军国主义势力的重振旗鼓，以阿登纳和岸信介为代表的西德和日本军国主义分子对外扩张的活动也越来越加紧了。最近阿登纳政府借口需要训练地点，已同佛朗哥政府谈判在西班牙建立西德军事基地，也向葡萄牙、土耳其、希腊、法国和意大利提出了同样的要求。阿登纳一再叫嚣“德国必须强大到收复失地的程度”；“除非统一欧洲，我们将不能收回柏林和德国东部”。而岸信介自从签订新日美“安全条约”以后，也加速扩军备战，公然叫嚷条约的适用范围包括苏联和中国的领土。日本前首相吉田茂扬言“领土并非永远一成不变。日本以前曾扩大到满洲的边缘，假如国力一天天伸张，领土也会扩大”。他不认为“日本领土将永远保持现状。”所有这些，都是对欧洲、亚洲和全世界人民的危险信号。
    然而，正是由于西德和日本军国主义的侵略祸心日益暴露，它们的处境也越来越困难，越来越孤立。阿登纳和岸信介这次所以不顾世界人民对1940年缔结的遗臭万年的德日意法西斯轴心记忆犹新，甘冒天下之大不韪，公开进行勾结，也说明西德和日本军国主义的处境是何等不妙，急于寻求互相支持。阿登纳访日期间十分强调西德和日本的“共同利益”、“共同性”和“传统友谊”，并且竭力给由于签订新日美“安全条约”而面临日本广大人民强烈反对的岸信介大打其气；岸信介也积极为阿登纳破坏首脑会谈、阻挠缓和国际局势的态度捧场。
    阿登纳和岸信介这种同世界各国爱好和平人民的愿望背道而驰的活动，是在美国的直接指使下进行的，也是直接服务于美国的战争政策和侵略政策的。谁都知道，阿登纳是在访问美国之后到日本去的。美国国务卿赫脱在阿登纳访美期间曾明确表示：如果对最高级会议的结果太乐观的话，那将是愚蠢的。艾森豪威尔也肯定地告诉他：“美国国旗将继续在柏林上空飘扬”。阿登纳还为此感到“心满意足”。而当阿登纳、岸信介的联合声明刚一发表，美国的宣传机器就十分满意地称赞“这在世界上是一种新的支持波恩在柏林和统一德国的问题上采取的政策的声音”。阿登纳这次在最高级会议即将举行的时候访问日本，用心就在会议之前“动荡和毒化国际气氛”。这正是美帝国主义所希望的事情。
    西德和日本的军国主义势力的互相勾结是毫不足怪的。这不仅是由于它们在历史上就曾经狼狈为奸，而且今天全都是在美国的控制下，充当美国推行其霸占全球的侵略计划的工具。美国在战后不惜公然毁弃世界正义人类以无数鲜血和生命换来的雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告等国际协议，不遗余力地复活西德和日本的军国主义势力，目的也在于此。美国的想法是：“德国曾是一个强大的军事强国，德国人是了不起的战士。在下一次战争中，我们要使德国人站在美国一边。”（美国会民主党议员汤姆斯发言）“我们只供给军火就够了，我们的孩子不需去欧洲流血，那里有足够的德国人去为美国的利益送死。”（美国将军柯林斯语）至于日本，美国一开始就企图把它扶植为“美国确保太平洋安全和援助亚洲落后国家的帮手。”（洛克菲勒基金委员会报告）今天来自西德和日本的战争威胁，其根源正是美帝国主义的战争政策。美国的如意算盘结果如何？人们不妨回顾一下过去的历史。第二次世界大战以前，西方国家曾帮助德、日帝国主义，企图利用它们反对苏联和其他国家，结果是：“搬起石头打自己的脚”。美帝国主义所以一定要倒霉，就因为它不愿意也不可能认识这种搬起石头打自己的脚的历史教训，就因为它完全无视于战后世界情势的变化。希特勒德国在欧洲的失败标志了欧洲的新时代的开始，日本帝国主义的失败也标志了亚洲新的时代的开始。今天，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量空前强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动日益高涨，而在被美国视为它发动侵略战争的两根支柱的西德和日本国内，反对美国分裂德国和复活西德军国主义的斗争正在开展，反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争声势浩大。美国继续扶持西德和日本，加强这两个战争危险的策源地，最后难免自食其果。
    中国人民一贯坚决反对美国复活西德和日本的军国主义和准备新战争的罪恶活动，坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国所提出的同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题的合理建议，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争。当此西德和日本军国主义在美帝国主义的支持下进一步勾结起来，严重威胁世界和平的时候，中国人民将更加努力加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强同德国人民、日本人民和全世界人民的团结，百倍警惕，反对侵略，保卫和平。我们确信，在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营面前，在全世界强大的爱好和平力量面前，不管是西德和日本的军国主义也好，是美帝国主义也好，如果敢发动侵略战争，那么，遭到彻底毁灭的，肯定地将是它们自己！
