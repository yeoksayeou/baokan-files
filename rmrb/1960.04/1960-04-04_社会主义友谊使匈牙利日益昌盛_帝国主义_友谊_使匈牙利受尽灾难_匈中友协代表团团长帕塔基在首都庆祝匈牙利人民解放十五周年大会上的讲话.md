Dear Comrades and Friends,

These days, the Hungarian People's Republic and all the Hungarian people are celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of our motherland. We are pleased and honored that the entire socialist camp—including the great People's Republic of China and its working people—is celebrating this festival with us. This kind of comradely and fraternal friendship must further increase the enthusiasm and labor zeal of our people in building socialism, thereby adding new strength in completing new tasks. Therefore, please allow me, first of all, on behalf of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association and myself, to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the participants of the conference.

In the fifteen years since liberation, a series of historically significant changes have taken place in the lives of the Hungarian people, abolishing the capitalist system of human exploitation. Currently, under the leadership of the Party, the Hungarian people are victoriously striving to lay a complete socialist foundation, so as to enable the socialist system to achieve complete victory in our country as soon as possible. The source of victory in the construction of the new socialist Hungary is: the selfless labor of the Hungarian working people, our Party's consistent policy of relying on the working people, and the friendship and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.

The past fifteen years have shown the Hungarian people what true friendship is. Before liberation, Hungary was a toy of imperialism, which lavishly spoke of sympathy for Hungary, but placed our country under their political control, plundered our resources, prevented economic development, and finally dragged our people into war. Facts have proved that the so-called "friendship" of capitalist countries has brought us nothing but oppression and disaster.

After World War II, when Hungary became a member of the socialist family, the situation changed. With the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, Hungary's economy has generally flourished, and important achievements in science, culture, and art have become the wealth of the people, and the working people are full of confidence in the future. Facts have proved that the friendship of socialist countries is the highest guarantee for the prosperity and happiness of our working people. The example of Hungary proves once again that the so-called friendship of capitalist countries and the friendship of socialist countries are two completely different things. The so-called friendship between capitalist countries is characterized by bullying the weak, is built on the basis of harming others and benefiting oneself, and is used to oppose the workers, peasants, and masses and oppress the people. In contrast, the friendship between socialist countries is characterized by mutual selfless support, and the foundation of friendship between socialist countries is proletarian internationalism. This friendship is constantly developing and strengthening in the common struggle for socialist and communist construction. The friendship between the peoples of the socialist camp is the friendship of the liberated working people, the friendship of workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals, which is true friendship.

The friendship between the peoples of the socialist camp is not an empty word; it is increasingly manifested in all aspects of our lives. This friendship is one of the most important guarantees for the development of the socialist camp and the defense of world peace.

The noble and glorious task of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association is to work tirelessly, together with the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association, within our socialist family, to develop the friendly relations between the Hungarian and Chinese people for the victory of socialist construction. This is a very beautiful, exciting, and also serious task. The ties between the Hungarian people and the fraternal Chinese people have been comprehensively developed and grown in recent years. The task of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association is to further develop this already established and extremely broad cooperation. The actions, determination, and boundless enthusiasm of the Hungarian experts and representatives who have been to China, and especially the unwavering friendship of the entire Hungarian people towards the fraternal Chinese people, are the guarantees for the successful completion of the tasks of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association. The close friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese people is built on the foundation of the common interests and common goals of the two peoples. Our common goal is to build socialism and communism, ensure world peace, and stop the war and aggression plans of imperialist adventurers.

Like the Chinese people, we Hungarians also hold a belief in future victory and do our best to struggle for the realization of these tasks. When we think that we are members of the socialist camp, led by the great Soviet Union, from the Elbe to the Pacific, we increase new strength in our work. The friendship of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries is the factor that enables our people to survive.

Now, as we celebrate the liberation of Hungary and look back on the history of the past fifteen years, every member of the socialist camp can only feel excited. Regardless of the various conspiracies and tricks of the imperialist elements, from the Elbe to the Pacific, the cause of socialism and communism is still advancing victoriously. In eternal fraternal friendship, the thoughts and wills of more than 900 million people are united. For the continued consolidation of the entire socialist camp, for the interests of our people, may the great friendship between the working people of our two countries, Hungary and China, continue to develop and consolidate in the socialist family!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese people!

    社会主义友谊使匈牙利日益昌盛  帝国主义“友谊”使匈牙利受尽灾难
    匈中友协代表团团长帕塔基在首都庆祝匈牙利人民解放十五周年大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    这几天匈牙利人民共和国、全体匈牙利人民正在庆祝我们祖国解放十五周年。使我们感到高兴和荣幸的是，整个社会主义阵营——其中包括伟大的中华人民共和国及其劳动人民，在和我们一起庆祝这个节日。这种同志般的兄弟友谊，必须进一步增加我们人民建设社会主义的积极性和劳动热情，从而在完成新的任务方面，增加新的力量。因此，请允许我首先以匈牙利中国友好协会和我本人的名义，向大会的所有参加者，致以衷心的谢意。
    解放十五年来，在匈牙利人民的生活中发生了一系列具有历史意义的变化，废除了人剥削人的资本主义制度。目前，匈牙利人民在党的领导下，正在胜利地为完全奠定社会主义基础而努力，以便早日使社会主义制度在我国全部取得胜利。在新的社会主义匈牙利的建设事业中，取得胜利的源泉是：匈牙利劳动人民忘我的劳动，我们党一贯依靠劳动人民的政策，和苏联以及整个社会主义阵营的友谊和无私援助。
    过去的十五年，向匈牙利人民说明了什么是真正的友谊。在解放以前，匈牙利是帝国主义的玩具，他们奢言对匈牙利的同情，但却把我国置于他们的政治控制之下，掠夺我国资源，阻止经济发展，最后把我国人民卷入战争。事实证明，资本主义国家的所谓“友谊”，给我们带来的只不过是压迫和灾难。
    第二次世界大战以后，当匈牙利已成为社会主义大家庭的一员时，情况就改变了。在苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助下，匈牙利的经济得到了普遍的高涨，科学、文化和艺术的重要成就变成了人民的财富，劳动人民对未来充满了信心。事实证明，社会主义国家的友谊，是我国劳动人民繁荣和幸福生活的最高保证。匈牙利的例子再次证明，资本主义国家的所谓友谊和社会主义国家的友谊是两件绝然不同的事。资本主义国家之间的所谓友谊的特点是以强欺弱，是建筑在损人利己的基础上的，是用来反对工农群众和压迫人民的。与此相反，社会主义国家之间的友谊的特点则是相互无私的支援，社会主义国家之间的友谊的基础，是无产阶级国际主义。这种友谊在为社会主义和共产主义建设而进行的共同斗争中，不断地得到发展和加强。社会主义阵营各国之间的友谊是解放了的劳动人民的友谊，是工人、农民和进步知识分子的友谊，这是真正的友谊。
    社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友谊并不是一个空洞的字眼，它日益明显地表现在我们生活的各方面。这种友谊是社会主义阵营的发展和保卫世界和平最重要的保证之一。
    匈中友好协会崇高而光荣的任务，是在我们社会主义的大家庭中，和中匈友好协会一起，为了社会主义建设的胜利，不倦地发展匈中人民的友好关系。这是非常美好的、令人兴奋的，同时也是严肃的任务。匈牙利人民和兄弟的中国人民之间的联系，在最近几年里，全面地得到了发展和增长，匈中友协的任务在于进一步发展这种已经建立起来的、极为广泛的合作。匈中友协的行动、决心和到过中国的匈牙利专家和代表的无限热忱，特别是全匈牙利人民对兄弟的中国人民的毫不动摇的友谊都是匈中友协胜利完成任务的保证。匈牙利人民和中国人民亲密的友谊是建筑在两国人民的共同利益和共同奋斗目标的基础上的，我们共同的目标是建立社会主义和共产主义，保证世界的和平和制止帝国主义冒险家的战争和侵略计划。
    和中国人民一样，我们匈牙利人也抱着对未来胜利的信念，尽自己的一切力量来为这些任务的实现而奋斗。当想到我们是以伟大苏联为首，从易北河到太平洋的社会主义阵营的成员时，在工作中我们就增加了新的力量。苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的友谊是我们人民得以生存的因素。
    现在当我们庆祝匈牙利解放，回顾过去十五年历史的时候，社会主义阵营的每个成员只会感到兴奋。不管帝国主义分子的各种阴谋诡计，从易北河到太平洋，社会主义和共产主义事业还是胜利地前进着。在永恒的兄弟般的友谊中，九亿多人民的思想和意志是一致的。为了整个社会主义阵营的继续巩固，为了我们人民的利益，愿我们匈中两国劳动人民的伟大友谊在社会主义大家庭中继续不断地发展和巩固！
    匈中人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
