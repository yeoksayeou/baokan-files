Comrades,

I wholeheartedly support the reports made by the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. In Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, it was proposed to place animal husbandry on an equal footing with crop cultivation and called for a new upsurge in the comprehensive development of animal husbandry with pig raising as the center. As a veterinary scientist, I am particularly encouraged. Now, I will give a brief report on the development of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, and I welcome your criticism and suggestions.

Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine is the summary of the experience of our laboring people in fighting against livestock diseases. It has a long history and rich content. However, for a long time, due to the extreme discrimination and destruction by the reactionary ruling class, it has been greatly hindered and has not been developed.

The great Party and Chairman Mao have always attached importance to and cared for traditional Chinese veterinary medicine. Since liberation, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's policy of "uniting, educating, using, and improving" traditional Chinese veterinary doctors and the policy of uniting Chinese and Western veterinary medicine to inherit and develop the heritage of the motherland's veterinary medicine, the enthusiasm of traditional Chinese veterinary doctors has been greatly stimulated, and their work has flourished. In June 1958, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences convened the first National Symposium on Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine Research in Lanzhou. Judging from the materials reported at the recent Second National Conference on Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine Research, in the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party, traditional Chinese veterinary medicine has shown an even more prosperous situation and achieved remarkable results.

In terms of the number and quality of traditional Chinese veterinary doctors, there has been a great increase, and their political status has been unprecedentedly improved. For example, in Gansu Province, the number has increased from 2,600 before liberation to more than 6,200, of which about 3,500 have received further training. In 1958, they and the epidemic prevention workers together treated more than 15 million head (times) of livestock, which is equal to eighty times the total in the nine years (1941-1949) under the Kuomintang rule. Their diligence and contribution have been respected by all parties. Some have been rated as advanced workers, and many have served as leaders of veterinary hospitals (institutes). Some have even been elected as members of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference. These are all unprecedented events.

Research institutions and forces have been constantly growing. Before July 1958, there were only two traditional Chinese veterinary medicine research units in the country with very few personnel. Now, ten provinces have established them, and some provinces have also established research offices (groups) in counties and people's communes. A national network of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine research and a large collaboration have been initially formed, with 54 units participating, including cooperation between the livestock and veterinary science research systems of provinces and regions, as well as between them and higher education institutions, other relevant fraternal units, and production departments, mutually contacting, supporting each other, exchanging information, and fighting in coordination to promote the development of research work. It is also worth noting that Western veterinary doctors are learning from traditional Chinese veterinary medicine in an unprecedented upsurge, and the previous "sectarianism" has been basically eliminated. In 1959, two consecutive training classes on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine were held in Lanzhou. The sixty to seventy students were all senior Western veterinary doctors. At the time of graduation, they could initially master the basic theory and technology of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine and apply it in their practical work, especially acupuncture, which was highly praised. Therefore, the third session will continue to be held in 1960 and the scope will be expanded, and the study period will be changed to one year.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, with the development of animal husbandry and the victory of the scientific and technological revolution, traditional Chinese veterinary medicine research work, following the Party's traditional Chinese veterinary medicine policy and the socialist scientific path, adhering to putting politics in command, implementing the combination of production, following the mass line, and the policy of "walking on two legs" in developing scientific undertakings, has achieved great results.

In terms of excavating and collating ancient books on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine and compiling books, in the past year or so, various places have proofread and supplemented nine kinds of classics, most of which have been lost for hundreds of years. Now, they are reappearing in the world, with more than 150,000 copies distributed. In order to introduce the theory and experience of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine in a more systematic and comprehensive way, relevant units across the country have been organized to cooperate, and Chinese and Western veterinary doctors have jointly written and reviewed four sets of books on the theoretical system of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, two of which have been published. In the work, books have been compiled, academic discussions have been carried out, and the level of cadres has also been improved. In addition, four kinds of experience collections of famous traditional Chinese veterinary doctors have been published. These have been widely welcomed and have greatly helped in learning and practical application. In 1959, under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, a nationwide "collection of folk customs" movement of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine was widely carried out, collecting thousands of effective prescriptions and secret recipes, and carrying out the collection and collation of materials. Gansu Province alone contributed 4,283 effective prescriptions, 111 ancient books, and 118 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine samples at the Second Provincial Congress of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Doctors. Many old gentlemen were still sorting out materials late at night, racking their brains to contribute some secret prescriptions and manuscripts that they would not even pass on to their relatives in the past, in order to repay the Party's care.

In the research on the treatment of major livestock diseases, many Chinese medicines or combinations of Chinese and Western medicines have been verified or identified, and have been promoted and applied in production. For some epidemic diseases that Western veterinary science has not been able to solve well, effective drugs have also been initially obtained, such as pig enzootic pneumonia, bovine brucellosis, equine nasal catarrh, and bovine contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. Among them, pig enzootic pneumonia, combined with strengthening feeding management, isolation and disinfection, has been proven to be able to control and eliminate it. In addition, there are also prescriptions for estrus induction and fetal protection. What is particularly worth mentioning is traditional Chinese veterinary acupuncture, which not only has a short course of treatment, high effectiveness, and is easy to use, but also has a wide range of applications. It can treat internal diseases (such as equine colic, bovine rumen tympany, etc.), and can also treat surgical diseases (such as equine sprains and lameness, bovine and equine rheumatism, etc.), and can also treat some early infectious diseases (such as pig enzootic pneumonia, hog cholera, and swine erysipelas, etc.). Research on electroacupuncture therapy and the physiological mechanism and meridian pathways of acupuncture has also begun. Last year, acupuncture techniques for camels, sheep, chickens, rabbits, etc., which have never been recorded before, are also being collected, collated, and studied. All of the above shows that the motherland's veterinary medicine heritage is indeed a great "treasure house," waiting for us to vigorously excavate, and further proves that the Party's traditional Chinese veterinary medicine policy is great and correct.

In the past year or so, although traditional Chinese veterinary medicine research has achieved considerable results, it is still far from meeting the requirements of high-speed and large-scale development of animal husbandry. There are also some problems in academic thinking and research methods that require everyone to pay attention to and study.

First, the research on the basic theory of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine: Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine not only has extremely rich clinical experience, but also has a complete theoretical system. However, the research on basic theory is still a very weak link. If we do not pay attention to it, the research work cannot advance rapidly by leaps and bounds. Therefore, how to use dialectical materialism, modern scientific methods or the latest technological achievements to study basic theory, promote the heritage of the motherland's veterinary medicine, and solve the prevention and treatment of major livestock diseases is a very important issue.

Second, the research on traditional Chinese veterinary acupuncture: In the past, we need to vigorously strengthen the research on the indications of acupuncture for small and medium-sized livestock and poultry, especially pigs, as well as the research on meridian theory and acupuncture mechanism. This is another important issue in the research of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine science.

Third, the research on traditional Chinese medicine: To develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising, especially the application of traditional Chinese medicine to prevent and treat diseases of pigs and poultry, we must further explore new methods and ways of processing and using medicine according to the basic principles of traditional Chinese medicine preparation and use. In this regard, we must be cautious in research and bold in trying.

Comrades, the high-speed development of animal husbandry in our country has extremely magnificent prospects. We believe that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements in a big way, continue to implement the Party's traditional Chinese veterinary medicine policy and scientific research policy, adhere to the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard, do a good job in cooperation, concentrate our efforts, summarize the rich experience of the masses, break through the prevention and treatment of major livestock diseases, and at the same time actively carry out research on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine theory, and further closely combine scientific research, education, and production, cultivate new forces, strengthen the research team, and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a big way, the traditional Chinese veterinary medicine academic undertaking will surely achieve new development. Let us forever hold high the great banner of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, ride the wind and waves, and forge ahead bravely! Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine scientific research work must continue to leap forward, and it will certainly be able to continue to leap forward.

### 党的中兽医政策的胜利  蒋次升代表的发言

    党的中兽医政策的胜利
    蒋次升代表的发言各位代表：
    我衷心拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理所作的各项报告。在李富春副总理的报告中，提出了把畜牧业放在种植业同等的地位，并号召掀起一个以养猪为中心全面发展畜牧业的新高潮。我作为一个兽医科学工作者，特别感到振奋。现在我就中兽医工作发展情况，作个简要汇报，请予批评指正。
    中兽医学术是我国劳动人民同家畜疾病进行斗争的经验总结，具有悠久的历史和丰富的内容。但长期以来，由于受到反动统治阶级的极端歧视和摧残，因此，受到了很大的阻碍，没有得到发展。
    伟大的党和毛主席自来就重视和关怀中兽医工作。解放以来，在党的“团结、教育、使用、提高”中兽医的方针和团结中西兽医继承发扬祖国兽医学遗产的政策光辉照耀下，中兽医的积极性大为发挥，工作蓬勃地开展起来，中国农业科学院于1958年6月在兰州召开了第一次全国中兽医研究工作座谈会，会议期间正式成立了中兽医研究所。从最近召开的第二次全国中兽医研究工作会议报道的资料看，一年多来，中兽医工作在党的领导下出现了更为繁荣的局面，取得了显著成绩。
    在中兽医数量和质量方面，有了很大增长，政治地位空前提高。例如甘肃省从解放前的二千六百人增至六千二百余人，其中约有三千五百人得到进修，1958年他们和防疫员一起，防治的家畜达一千五百多万头（次），等于国民党统治时期九年（1941年——1949年）总和的八十倍，他们的勤劳和贡献，受到了各方面的尊重，有的被评为先进工作者，很多担任了兽医院（所）的领导职务，还有的被选为省政协委员，这些都是史无前例的事情。
    在研究机构和力量方面，不断壮大起来，1958年7月前全国只有两个中兽医研究单位，人员很少，现在有十个省都建立起来了，有的省在县和人民公社里也设了研究室（组）。全国范围的中兽医研究工作网和大协作已经初步组成，现有五十四个单位参加，包括省区与省的畜牧兽医科学研究系统之间、以及它们与高等院校、其他有关兄弟单位、生产部门之间的协作，互相联系，互相支援，交换资料，联合作战，以促进研究工作的发展。还值得注意的是：西兽医学习中兽医空前高涨，过去的“门户之见”，基本消除。1959年在兰州连续举办的两期中兽医训练班，六七十名学员都是高级西兽医，在结业时能初步掌握中兽医基础理论和技术，回去后在实际工作中应用，特别是针灸，很受赞扬，因而在1960年继续举办第三期，并扩大范围，学习期限改为一年。
    在党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉照耀下，随着畜牧业的发展和科学技术大革命的胜利，中兽医研究工作，遵循党的中兽医政策和社会主义的科学道路，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻结合生产、走群众路线和“两条腿走路”发展科学事业的方针，取得很大成绩。
    在发掘、整理中兽医古籍和编书方面，年余来各地校正增补了典籍有九种，绝大多数都湮没了数百年，现今重问于世，发行达十五万册以上。为了较系统的、较全面的介绍中兽医的理论和经验，组织了全国有关单位协作，中西兽医合作编写和审查成套的中兽医理论体系书籍四种，其中两种已经出版，在工作中既编了书，又开展了学术讨论，也提高了干部水平。此外还出版了著名中兽医经验集四种。这些都受到广泛的欢迎，大大帮助了学习和生产上的应用。1959年在农业部的领导下，全国广泛地开展了中兽医“采风”运动，收集了千千万万的验方秘方，进行了资料的汇集和整理工作。甘肃省仅在第二次全省中兽医代表会议上就献出了验方四千二百八十三件，古籍一百一十一本，还有中药样品一百一十八种，许多老先生深夜还在整理材料，挖尽心思把一些过去给亲属都不传的秘方、抄本献了出来，报答党的爱护。
    在治疗家畜主要疾病的研究方面，已验证或鉴定很多中药或中西药结合的方剂，并在生产上推广应用。对某些西兽医科学一直没有很好解决的疫病，也初步取得了有效的药剂，如猪喘气病、牛布氏杆菌病、马鼻疸、牛肺疫等。其中猪喘气病结合加强饲养管理，隔离消毒等措施，证明能够控制和消灭它。此外还有催情、保胎的方剂。特别值得提出的是中兽医针灸术，不仅疗程短，效果高，使用简便，而且适应范围广泛，可以治疗内科疾病（如马疝痛、牛瘤胃臌气等），也可以治疗外科疾病（如马闪伤跛行、牛马风湿症等），还可以治疗一些早期的传染病（如猪喘气病、猪瘟、猪肺疫等）。关于电针疗法以及针灸生理机制和经络行径的研究，也已开始进行。去年从来没有记载过的骆驼、羊、鸡、兔等的针灸术，也正在收集、整理、研究。以上这些都说明了祖国兽医学遗产，的确是一个伟大的“宝库”，有待我们大力发掘，更加证明党的中兽医政策，是伟大正确的。
    一年多来，中兽医研究工作虽然取得了不小的成绩，但和高速度、大规模发展畜牧业的要求，还远远不相适应。在学术思想上和研究方法上也还有一些问题，须要大家注意研究。
    第一关于中兽医基础理论的研究问题：中兽医学不仅有极其丰富的临床经验，而且有一套完整的理论体系。但目前基础理论的研究，还是很薄弱的一环。如不加以注意，研究工作就不能很快的大踏步的前进。因此如何运用辩证唯物观点，现代科学方法或最新技术成就，研究基础理论，发扬祖国兽医学遗产，解决家畜主要疾病的防治，这是一个很重要问题。
    第二关于中兽医针灸的研究问题：过去对中小家畜和家禽特别是对猪的针灸适应症研究及对经络学说和针灸机制的研究，都要我们大力加强，这是研究中兽医科学的另一重要问题。
    第三关于中药研究问题：开展养猪为中心的畜牧业，尤其是应用中药防治猪、禽等的疾病，必须要我们根据中药制药用药的基本原则，进一步探索新的炮制、使用方法和途径。在这方面，既要谨慎研究，又要大胆尝试。
    各位代表：我国畜牧业的高速度发展，前途是极其宏伟的。我们相信只要坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，继续贯彻党的中兽医政策和科学研究方针，坚持全国一盘棋的精神，搞好协作，集中力量，总结群众的丰富经验，突破家畜主要疾病的防治问题，同时积极开展中兽医医学理论的研究，并进一步密切科学研究、教育、生产三者之间的结合，培养新生力量，壮大研究队伍，大搞技术革新和技术革命，中兽医学术事业，就一定能得到新的发展。让我们永远高举毛泽东思想的战无不胜的伟大旗帜，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！中兽医科学研究工作必须继续大跃进，也一定能够继续大跃进。
