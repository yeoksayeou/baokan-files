Ideological Great Revolution, Technical Great Revolution
Zheng Zhong, Secretary of the Party Committee, Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant

Editor's Note: The Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant is one of the red flags in Shanghai's vigorous promotion of the technological revolution this year. We have asked Comrade Zheng Zhong, the secretary of the Party Committee of this plant, to write this article.

In the first spring of the 1960s, encouraged by the new stage and new situation of socialist construction, workers at the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant launched a great storm of technical innovation and technical revolution, which brought about earth-shaking changes in the factory. Previously unimaginable full-scale automated production has begun to appear; the annual technical transformation plan, some were completed in a few days, some even overnight; backward tools that have been used for many years are now being thrown out of the workshop by the workers, replaced by mechanized operations. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the plant has rapidly increased from the original 49% to 92% by March 20th. The scale of the movement has developed from the revolution of individual machine tools to the comprehensive transformation of entire lines and large areas. Currently, forty-six production lines have been formed; more than two hundred machine tools have achieved single-machine automation, and more than four thousand innovation projects have been put into production. Of the seventy-plus types of work in the plant, each has undergone revolution, and production capacity has increased by multiples. Even the cooks in the welfare department, the childcare workers in the nursery, and the accountants in the accounting department have made innovations and creations. It is estimated that three million work hours can be saved throughout the year.

The rapid development of the technological revolution has brought about continuous leaps in production. Since the beginning of this year, monthly production plans have been comprehensively overfulfilled. The production cycle of products has also been compressed repeatedly. The 25,000 kW steam turbine generator originally took more than eighty days to produce, but now it only takes seventeen days, creating a new record; and some cutting-edge products with international standards have been completed.

People's mental outlook is undergoing profound changes in this great storm of technological revolution. Communist ideology is becoming more and more widely and deeply rooted among the broad masses.

The formation of this great storm of technological revolution began in the shearing and punching workshop. The technological revolution in this workshop has achieved certain results in recent years; however, manual operations still account for a large proportion of the workshop, and although the production level has increased significantly, it still cannot keep up with the leaps forward in the product workshops. At the beginning of the year, under the leadership of the Party branch of the shearing and punching workshop, the workers promoted the "poor stick" spirit, everyone participated, and vigorously promoted mechanization and semi-mechanization, achieving improvements in every process and innovations in every machine tool. 95% of manual operations were mechanized, production capacity increased more than doubled, and the number of personnel was reduced by more than forty. Their experience is: thorough ideological work, thorough mobilization of the masses, clear goals, rapid action, starting with indigenous methods, and continuous improvement. Less money, greater effect, and faster realization. The Party Committee promptly summarized the advanced experience of this workshop in carrying out the technological revolution, held an on-site meeting there, and widely disseminated the advanced ideas of the shearing and punching workers. The sparks of the shearing and punching workers ignited a raging fire throughout the plant, with far-reaching effects. Especially for the coil winding and cold forming workshops with similar production conditions, it has played a great role in promoting their progress. Each workshop has successively proposed the slogan of learning from shearing and punching, catching up with shearing and punching, and surpassing shearing and punching. The coil winding workshop, where 70% of the operations were manual, has always believed that "the traditional process of manual winding and wrapping cannot be changed". Now, driven by the shearing and punching workers, the female workers launched a climax of innovation in three days, changed the face of production in a week, and realized the full mechanization of winding and wrapping. The coil winding workshop quickly started, and in turn, promoted the shearing and punching workshop to continue to leap forward, connecting from the original single-machine automation to form ten production lines in three days. At this time, the cold forming workshop, which was in an intermediate state of technical innovation, also emerged under the influence of the shearing and punching and coil winding workshops. The workers, with their infinite creative talents, in just nine days, based on the simple principles of a funnel, a scale hammer, and a switch, transformed an old punch press, transforming manual operations that originally required forty-seven people and more than a dozen processes on a production area of ​​one thousand square meters, and established a huge automated production line from scratch, increasing production efficiency by seventy-one times at once. This initiative of the cold forming workers greatly shocked the workers throughout the plant, and several product workshops with a higher degree of mechanization also quickly caught up. The technological revolution movement in the plant has thus been continuously moving towards a new climax, wave after wave, link after link.

    Everyone yearns for communism
    Everyone makes great ambitions

The excellent situation in the new stage of socialist construction, and the further deepening of the Party's general line and a complete set of two-legged walking policies, are the great driving force for this technological revolution movement to surge forward.

We linked the study of the new stage, new situation, and new tasks with the development direction of the plant, and the struggle goals of groups and individuals, making the manufacturing of more power generation equipment for the people of the country in the 1960s the glorious and arduous task of the electrical machinery workers. A vivid situation emerged in the plant: "Thinking about revolution day and night, unwilling to give up if the face is not changed." An old worker put it well: "After studying, my horizons have broadened, my thinking has become clearer, my hands want to do more work, my feet want to run to the workshop, and my heart wants to make innovations." After the transportation workers in the foundry workshop completed their theoretical study, they immediately sent all the carrying poles to the Party branch, expressing their determination to throw away the carrying poles. They said, "Can we still bring the carrying poles to communism?!" Sun Ronghua, a transportation worker who had just shed his illiteracy cap, ran to twenty-five wharves on the Suzhou River in one day to learn about the experience of mechanized transportation, and worked for four nights in a row to draw one hundred and seventy-six sketches. The sand mold workers in the foundry workshop, with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, dug one meter deep in the workshop in one day and night, and transported nearly a thousand tons of waste sand out of the workshop, realizing mechanized casting. The workers think about innovation while eating, walking, dreaming, and even going to the toilet. They were inspired by a shot in a movie, a child's "rubber arrow", a swing, a slide, and even the pump used to flush the toilet, and created innovations. In order to solve the difficulties in innovation, the workers worked day and night, forgetting food and sleep, and forgetting self for the public, reaching a state of selflessness. Xu Dingnan, a lathe worker, could not fall asleep at night while creating an automatic calibration device. He happened to see a comrade sleeping on the bunk above him turning over, causing the iron bars on the iron bed to stretch and contract continuously. He was inspired by this and immediately got up to draw sketches. The next day, he realized his ideal based on this principle. Because the masses have a high sense of responsibility for the collective cause of the working class, and concentrate their minds to solve the difficult problems in technical innovation, many ordinary things that are usually not noticed by people are noticed by them, and they are inspired from them to solve mysterious technical problems. The emergence of this phenomenon is not accidental.

The awareness, enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers have been brought into play. Vigorous publicity of new people, new things, and new ideas, making them a powerful east wind, blowing throughout the plant, expanding its influence, from this to that, from point to area, is one of the important methods for us to carry out political and ideological education. It can play a role in mutual inspiration and mutual promotion, prompting the backward to catch up and the advanced to become more advanced. The female workers in the coil winding workshop, although they do not know how to operate lathes, planers, milling machines, etc., under the influence and inspiration of the advanced ideas of the shearing and punching workers, established ambitious goals, and started to work when they said they would, and within a short period of time, they increased the degree of mechanization from 30% to more than 93%. Advanced ideas emerging from the masses, if carried forward and amplified, can infect each other and permeate each other, reaching everywhere like mercury spilling on the ground. Female worker Zhang Hongying came to work at the plant after her maternity leave, while still very weak. The cadres of the workshop mobilized her several times to go back to rest. She saw the scene of her companions busily engaged in production line construction. She went to the workshop three consecutive times in three days. Seeing the workshop change dramatically three times in three days, she was so excited that she shed tears and resolutely asked the leadership to agree to her participation in the innovation efforts. She said: "The appearance of the workshop changed in one night, everyone has stepped into a new stage, how can I feel at ease to recuperate at home?!"

We deeply understand: In political and ideological work, the more deeply and thoroughly we talk to the masses about the new stage, new situation, and new tasks, the higher the wave of the technological revolution will rise; and the more the technological revolution movement moves forward, it in turn promotes the further improvement of the ideological consciousness of the masses. The two are thus complementary and mutually causal.

    People can create conditions

Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line are the fundamental lines for the Party to realize various political tasks, and also the fundamental lines for the Party to lead industry. Whether the technological revolution movement can develop widely and deeply and continuously forward also completely depends on whether the cadres can fully mobilize the masses and on the depth and breadth of the mass movement.

For such a fundamental issue, in the technological revolution movement, our plant was not deeply recognized and clearly grasped by all cadres from the beginning. The shearing and punching workshop and the coil winding workshop are a clear contrast. The cadres of the shearing and punching workshop believe in the masses, rely on the masses, let go of mobilizing the masses, let the masses fully liberate their minds, get along with the masses, and vigorously support the revolutionary creation of the masses. Therefore, the mobilization of the masses is getting deeper and wider, and the masses are becoming more and more energetic and interested in the technological revolution. The methods of innovation are becoming more and more numerous, and the automated equipment is being improved better and better. However, in the early stage of the movement in the coil winding workshop, a few cadres wanted to revolutionize verbally, but did not have the determination to revolutionize in action. They did not believe in the wisdom of the masses, and thought that mobilizing the masses would not solve the problem. They did not see the arrival of the new stage and the new situation, and did not see that the technological revolution had become the conscious and strong demand of the masses. They thought that those who wanted to revolutionize had already done so, so they did not mobilize the masses. Two kinds of thought and two kinds of work style led to two completely different consequences: one was bustling with activity, and the other was deserted. Later, through comparative analysis of the two workshops, it was a profound ideological education on the mass line for the cadres of the coil winding workshop. Once the cadres' thinking changed, the masses were mobilized, and the situation completely changed: the female workers in coil winding threw all the wrapping tables used for manual operation out of the workshop overnight, realizing full mechanization. The practice of the mass movement once again profoundly educated us: of all the plans, the mass line is the most important.

There are also a few people who have a "condition-only" mentality. They say: "Manual processing, manual processing, the mind cannot move, no matter how you move, it is still manual processing!" "The products are large, the machine tools are new, and the degree of mechanization is high, so it cannot be compared with other workshops." These statements are nothing more than seeing things but not people, not believing in the masses, and unwilling to follow the mass line. Ye Jintao, an old worker in the winding section of the transformer workshop, used two foreign nails to make a revolution, realizing the mechanization of paper removal, giving a severe blow to those who advocate "condition-only". Some cadres in this section originally believed that winding work was different from other types of work. There were no machines and everything was done manually, so there were no conditions for making a revolution. This idea also affected some workers and restricted the creativity of the masses. After repeated theoretical study by the cadres using typical examples of making a revolution with indigenous methods, we broke the "condition-only" mentality among the cadres, and the thinking of the masses was also greatly liberated. The winding workers dared to think and act, and changed the paper wrapping machine to electrical control, and the face of the entire section underwent profound changes. They said with great emotion: "Manual processing, manual processing, the waist is sore and the back is painful. If you don't want to be sore and painful, you must use your brain more. Manual labor becomes motorized, and motorized becomes automatic."

    "Indigenous" has a high degree of vitality

In the technological revolution movement, ideological struggles rose and fell one after another. One problem was overcome, and another problem arose. Some people thought that the tasks were heavy, and that doing a little bit of technical revolution was like pulling a hair from an ox, which would not solve any problems. If we wanted to do it, we could only do it slowly. Whether to do it slowly or quickly is related to whether the technological revolution should be at a high speed and whether it can be at a high speed. The workers put it well: Sharpening the knife does not delay the cutting of vegetables. The technological revolution cannot delay production, but should promote production. The question is whether the technological revolution can be closely integrated with production. There are always weak links in production. Continuously overcoming weak links through technological revolution can continuously promote production. Some comrades did not realize this, and as a result, they opposed the technological revolution to the current. Ji Linsheng, the section chief of the parts section of the DC motor workshop, had a deep understanding. In the past, even in his spare time, he did not support the workers in making a revolution. He said: "Spending time on innovation is not as good as engaging in production." As a result, the masses were not mobilized, the face of the section could not be changed, and everything was passive. Now that his thinking has changed, he is making a revolution with the masses to tackle key problems, which greatly encourages the masses. The face of the section has changed rapidly. The masses put forward one hundred and twelve innovation suggestions in one day, and production increased by nearly double. It is really a double promotion of innovation and production. In the past, people called this section "the old ox pulling the cart," but now they call it "the rocket taking off."

Whether to adopt the "foreign" method or the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is another more prominent dispute in the technological revolution movement. Some people who value foreign methods over indigenous methods always want to reach the sky in one step and engage in high-level, formal methods. They do not understand that although the "indigenous" method is not very perfect at the beginning, it is simple and easy to implement, welcomed by the masses, and has a high degree of vitality. It can solve many problems that the foreign method cannot solve for a while; at the same time, it can be gradually improved. The edging machine developed by the sheet metal workers in the shearing and punching workshop is the best proof. Technicians once designed a 120-ton pressure bed to replace the heavy manual operation of the sheet metal workers. However, the workers did not agree with this "foreign" method. This is not only because the equipment is large, and the installation will affect the working area, and there are difficulties in the supply of molds; more importantly, everyone lacks experience in manufacturing such large equipment, and no one knows when it will be completed. How can distant water save the near fire? Later, the workers made do with simple equipment, relied on their own efforts, and spent only a few days using indigenous methods to develop an edging machine, which increased efficiency by more than five times. After thirty-one improvements, it was raised to the semi-automation level.

We have learned from this: The technological revolution must proceed from the actual production, start with indigenous methods, use indigenous methods when possible, and use foreign methods when possible, and gradually improve it. Those who value foreign methods over indigenous methods actually exclude the broad masses from the door of the technological revolution. The issue of indigenous and foreign methods is related to the issue of whether or not to have a mass movement.

    Popularization on the basis of improvement
    Popularization under the guidance of improvement

With the continuous deepening of the technological revolution movement, a series of tasks such as the enterprise's production technology planning and management will undergo new changes. The old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise. This requires us to continuously improve our leadership work to adapt to the requirements of the new situation and promote the leap forward in productivity. After the flood of the technological revolution rose, it often overwhelmed the old balance, and a new imbalance appeared. The old weak links are resolved, and new weak links occur. There are workshops with weak links in the factory, sections with weak links in the workshop, and groups with weak links in the section. Even on a production line, there are still processes with weak links. Even the most advanced workshops and sections always exist. The task of the leaders is to be good at guiding the masses, finding weak links, and directing the spearhead of the technological revolution to these weak links. Balance is relative, and imbalance is absolute. Only by correctly understanding this law can we lead the technological revolution movement to develop normally forward, from imbalance to balance, and from balance to imbalance.

Another problem encountered by the technological revolution movement is the relationship between popularization and improvement, that is, the relationship between cutting-edge and general innovation. After the masses are mobilized, tens of thousands of innovation suggestions will emerge at once. In addition to treating them with enthusiasm, we must also consciously guide the masses to strive in the direction of cutting-edge. Only in this way can we improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement. We mobilized the masses at all levels from factories to departments, workshops, and groups to formulate technological plans, combining near-term plans with long-term directions. We guided the masses to advance from the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization to automation and semi-automation; from the basis of the general innovation blooming everywhere to the cutting-edge of science and technology, thus creating a new atmosphere of "everyone offering generous gifts and cutting-edge technologies emerging every day", and successfully trial-produced some new products with international standards. In order to popularize under the guidance of improvement, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, organize the broad masses to march towards cutting-edge technology, and extensively carry out the "three-in-one combination" of scientific research activities throughout the plant, organized workers to learn new technologies, and launched a new upsurge of learning culture and technology, combining the technological revolution with the cultural revolution. Now, seventy scientific research groups have been established, and the main task is to study the key issues of the current technological revolution and advance towards a more advanced direction. This is an effective form of improving the scientific and technological level of employees and organizing the masses to attack cutting-edge technology.

After forming a linkage from single-machine automation and linking several processes into production lines, production efficiency has been significantly improved. The planning work of organizing production must correspondingly keep up to ensure that each production line has a full workload. The design of products should also continuously consider the versatility and standardization of component structures to adapt to the characteristics of mass production on assembly lines, and do everything possible to reduce auxiliary work hours for adjusting equipment. This puts forward new tasks for designers and planners. Neglecting this link will affect the improvement of production efficiency. Because the idle time of each production line will cause the simultaneous shutdown of more than a dozen processes; one minute of idle time for a linked production line means more than ten minutes of idle work hours. In addition, the nursery, canteen, labor protection, safety facilities, and other aspects of the welfare department must take timely measures. In short, we take the leap forward in production as the key, grasp the red line of technological revolution, and promote the management work, cultural and educational work, and welfare work of the enterprise to keep up accordingly, driving the overall leap forward of the enterprise.

            ＊ ＊ ＊

In general, the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement in this period has achieved success under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee. However, according to the requirements of the new stage, new situation, and new tasks for us, there is still a great distance. We will repeatedly educate the cadres and masses throughout the plant to guard against arrogance and impatience, never be complacent, and adhere to the spirit of continuous revolution. There is no end on the wide road of technological revolution. What's more, there are still some heavy manual operations in the plant that can continue to be changed to mechanization; even those that have been mechanized can continue to be improved and developed in the direction of linkage and automation. At present, we are using the experience gained from the technological revolution movement to revise the technological plan from the bottom up. Grasp today with one hand and tomorrow with the other, both grasp the continued improvement of the degree of mechanization and grasp the rapid realization of key cutting-edge projects. In this great era, holding high the red flag of the Party's general line, we will bravely move forward to realize the continued leap forward in the future!

    思想大革命　技术大革命
    上海电机厂党委书记　郑重
    编者按：上海电机厂是上海今年大搞技术革命的红旗之一。我们请这个厂的党委书记郑重同志写了这篇文章。
    六十年代第一个春天，上海电机厂工人在社会主义建设新阶段、新形势的鼓舞下，爆发了一场技术革新和技术革命的大风暴，使工厂的面貌起了翻天复地的变化。过去从来不敢想像的全盘自动化生产，已经开始出现；全年的技术改造规划，有的在几天内，有的甚至在一个晚上就突击完成；多少年来一直使用的落后工具，现在被工人们掼出车间，已用机械化操作来代替。全厂机械化半机械化程度，从原来的49％，到3月20日止迅速提高到92％。运动的规模从一台台机床的革命，发展到整个一条线，整个一大片的全面改造，目前已经组成了四十六条生产流水线；二百多台机床实现了单机自动化，投入生产的革新项目达四千多项。全厂七十多个工种，每个工种都有革命，生产能力都是数以倍计的提高，连生活福利部门的炊事员、托儿所的保育员、会计科的会计员也都有革新创造。估计全年能节约三百万个工时。
    技术革命的飞跃发展，带来了生产上的不断跃进。今年以来，月月全面超额完成生产计划。产品的生产周期也一再压缩，二万五千瓩汽轮发电机原来要八十多天，现在只要十七天，创造了最新纪录；并且完成了一些具有国际水平的尖端产品。
    人们的精神面貌，在这场技术革命的大风暴中，起着深刻的变化。共产主义思想愈来愈广泛和深入地在广大群众中扎下了根。
    这场技术革命大风暴的形成，是从剪冲车间开始的。这个车间的技术革命，几年来取得了一定的成绩；但是车间里的手工操作仍占很大比重，生产水平虽有显著增长，但仍然跟不上产品车间的跃进。年初，剪冲工人在车间党支部的领导下，发扬“穷棒子”精神，人人动手，大搞机械化和半机械化，做到了道道工序有改进、台台机床有革新，95％的手工操作实现了机械化，生产能力猛增一倍以上，人员反而可减少四十余名。他们的经验是：思想工作深，群众发动透，目标明确，行动迅速，土法上马，不断完善。花钱少、效果大、实现快。党委及时总结了这个车间开展技术革命的先进经验，在那里召开了现场会议，广泛传播剪冲工人的先进思想。剪冲工人的星星之火，在全厂燃起了一场熊熊烈火，影响非常深远。尤其对生产条件类似的线圈、冷作等先行车间，更是起到了很大的促进作用。各个车间都纷纷提出了学剪冲、赶剪冲、超剪冲的口号。70％是手工操作的线圈车间，一向认为“用手工包扎的传统工艺，是无法改变的”，如今在剪冲工人的带动下，女工们三天掀起革新高潮，一周改变生产面貌，实现了绕线包扎全盘机械化。线圈车间迅速上马，回过来又促使剪冲车间继续飞跃，三天内就从原来的单机自动化，连接起来组成了十条生产流水线。这时，技术革新处于中间状态的冷作车间，在剪冲与线圈车间的影响下，也异军突起，工人们仅仅以九天的时间，就凭着他们无穷无尽的创造才能，根据一只漏斗、一只秤锤、一只开关的简单原理，改装了一台旧冲床，把原来需要四十七个人，前后要经过十几道工序的手工操作，在一千平方米的生产面积上，白手起家组成了一条规模巨大的自动化流水线，生产效率一下子就提高了七十一倍。冷作工人的这个创举，对全厂职工震动很大，原来机械化程度较高的几个产品车间，也急起直追。全厂的技术革命运动，就这样一浪推一浪、一环扣一环地不断走向新的高潮。
      人人向往共产主义
      个个立下雄心壮志
    社会主义建设新阶段的大好形势，党的总路线和一整套两条腿走路方针的进一步深入人心，是这次技术革命运动能够汹涌澎湃向前发展的巨大动力。
    我们把对新阶段、新形势、新任务的学习和厂的发展方向，以及小组、个人的奋斗目标联系起来，把六十年代为全国人民制造更多的发电设备作为电机工人的光荣而艰巨的任务。全厂出现了一个“日思夜想闹革命，不改面貌不甘心”的生动局面。有个老工人说得好：“学习以后，眼界开阔了，思想开朗了，手就想多做生活，脚就想往车间里跑，心就想闹革新”。铸工车间的运输工人务虚之后，马上把所有的扛棒都送到支部去，表示掼掉扛棒的决心，他们说：“还能把扛棒带到共产主义去吗？！”刚摘掉文盲帽子的运输工人孙荣华，一天跑遍了苏州河上的二十五个码头，学习运输机械化的经验，连干四个夜晚画了一百七十六张草图。铸工车间的翻砂工人，以移山倒海的气概，一昼夜挖地一米深，从车间里运出近千吨的废砂，实现了浇铸机械化。工人们吃饭想，走路想，做梦想，甚至上厕所也想革新。他们从电影里的一个镜头、孩子玩的“橡皮箭”、秋千、滑梯、甚至通抽水马桶的泵浦得到启发，搞成了革新创造。为了解决革新中的难题，工人们夜以继日、废寝忘食、公而忘私，达到了忘我的境界。车床工人许定南，在创造自动校调器的日子里，深夜翻来复去的不能入眠，偶见睡在他上铺的同志翻了个身，使铁床上铁条的方格伸缩不停，他就从这里受到启发，立刻爬起来画草图。第二天，就根据这个原理，实现了他的理想。由于群众对工人阶级的集体事业有着高度的责任感，集中心思要解决技术革新中的难题，因而许多平时不为人们注意的平凡事物却被他们注意到了，并从中得到启示，解决了奥妙的技术难题。这种现象的出现，并不是偶然的。
    广大工人的自觉性、积极性和创造性发挥出来了。大张旗鼓的宣传新人、新事、新思想，使之成为一股强大的东风，吹遍全厂，扩大其影响，由此及彼，由点及面，这是我们进行政治思想教育的重要方法之一。它可以起到相互启发、相互促进的作用，促使后进的赶上去，先进的更加先进。线圈车间的包扎女工，虽然不会车、钳、刨、铣，但是她们在剪冲工人先进思想的影响和启示下，树立了雄心大志，说干就干，短期内就把机械化程度从30％提高到93％以上。群众中涌现的先进思想，加以发扬光大，就能互相感染，互相渗透，似水银泻地一样无处不到。女工张红英，产假期满，身体还很虚弱，就来厂上班。车间干部几次动员她回去休息，她看到同伴们热火朝天大搞流水线的场面，三天接连三次到车间，看到车间三天三个大变样，激动得掉下了眼泪，坚决要求领导上同意她参加搞革新。她说：“一个晚上，车间面貌就变了，人人都已踏上新阶段，我怎能安心在家里养病呢？！”
    我们深刻体会：在政治思想工作中，越是把新阶段、新形势，新任务，向群众讲得深、谈得透，技术革命的浪潮就越是掀得高；而技术革命运动越是向前发展，又反过来促进群众的思想觉悟进一步提高。这两者，就是这样相辅相成，互为因果的。
      人可以创造条件
    相信群众、依靠群众、走群众路线，这是党实现各项政治任务的根本路线，也是党领导工业的根本路线。技术革命运动能不能广泛深入、不断地向前发展，也完全决定于干部能不能充分发动群众，决定于群众运动的深度和广度。
    对于这样一个根本问题，在技术革命运动中，我厂并不是一开始就为所有干部所深刻认识，明确掌握的。剪冲车间和线圈车间就是一个显明的对照。剪冲车间的干部相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，让群众充分解放思想，和群众打成一片，大力支持群众的革命创造，于是群众发动越来越深，越来越广，群众对技术革命越闹越有劲头，越闹越有味道，革新的办法越来越多，自动化设备越改越好。而线圈车间在运动初期，少数干部嘴上要革命，行动上却没有革命的决心，他们不相信群众的智慧，认为发动群众也不解决问题，他们看不到新阶段新形势的到来，看不到技术革命已成为群众的自觉的强烈要求，认为要革命的早就革掉了，因而不去发动群众。两种思想、两种作风，得出两种截然不同的后果：一个是热火朝天，一个是冷冷清清。后来，通过两个车间的对比分析，对线圈车间干部是一次深刻的群众路线思想教育。干部思想一旦转变，群众就发动起来了，形势完全变样了：线圈包扎女工一夜把手工操作用的包扎台全部甩出车间，实现了全盘机械化。群众运动的实践，再一次深刻教育我们：千计万计，群众路线第一计。
    还有少数人有一种“唯条件论”思想。他们说什么：“手加工，手加工，脑筋无法动，无论如何动，还是手加工！”“产品大、机床新、机械化程度高，不能与其它车间相提并论。”这些提法不过是见物不见人，不相信群众，不愿意走群众路线的借口。变压器车间绕线工段老工人叶锦涛两只洋钉闹革命，使拆纸实现机械化，给了“唯条件论”者一个狠狠的打击。这个工段有些干部本来认为绕线工作不同于其它工种，一没有机器，二都是手工，没有条件闹革命。这种思想也影响了一部分工人，束缚了群众的创造性。我们通过用土办法闹革命的典型事例，组织干部反复务虚之后，破除了干部中的“唯条件论”，使群众思想也大大得到解放。绕线工人敢想敢为，将包纸机改为电气控制，全工段的面貌起了深刻的变化。他们颇有感慨地说：“手加工，手加工，腰酸背又痛，要不酸又不痛，脑筋更要动，手工变机动，机动变自动。”
    “土”有高度的生命力
    在技术革命运动中，思想斗争此起彼伏。一个问题克服了，另一个问题又产生了。有少数人认为：任务繁重，搞一点半滴技术革命好像牯牛身上拔根毛，不解决什么问题，要搞也只能慢慢来。慢慢来还是快快来，这关系到技术革命要不要高速度、能不能高速度的问题。工人说得好：磨刀不误切菜工，技术革命不能耽误生产，更要推动生产，问题在于技术革命能不能紧紧与生产密切结合。生产上的薄弱环节，是始终存在的，技术革命不断克服薄弱环节，就能不断促进生产。有些同志认识不到这一点，结果就把技术革命与当前对立起来。直流电机车间零件工段长计林生体会很深，过去即使业余时间，他也不支持工人闹革命，他说：“花时间在革新上，还不如搞搞生产。“结果群众没有发动起来，工段面貌得不到改变，处处被动。现在他思想转变了，与群众一起闹革命攻关键，对群众鼓舞很大，工段面貌迅速改变，一天内群众提出了一百一十二条革新建议，生产增长近一倍，真是革新生产双推动。过去人们叫这个工段是“老牛拖车”，现在称它为“火箭上天”。
    采取“洋”法还是土洋结合，是技术革命运动中又一个比较突出的争论。一些重洋轻土的人，总想一步登天，搞高级的、正规的。他们不懂得“土”的虽然一开始不十分完善，但它简单易行，为群众所欢迎，有高度的生命力，可以解决许多洋法还一时难以解决的问题；同时，也可以逐步提高。剪冲车间钣金工人所搞成的滚边机是一个最好的证明。技术人员曾经设计了一台压力一百二十吨的压床，来代替钣金工人笨重的手工操作。但是，工人不同意这个“洋”办法。这不仅是因为这台设备大，安装后影响作业面积，模具供应又有困难；更重要的是，制造这样大的设备，大家都缺乏经验，什么时候完成，谁都心中无数，远水怎能救得了近火？后来，工人们因陋就简，自力更生，用土办法只花了几天时间就搞成一台滚边机，效率提高五倍以上。又经过三十一次改进，再提高到半自动化水平。
    我们从这里体验到：技术革命必须从生产实际出发，用土法上马，能土则土，能洋则洋，逐步完善，这是技术革命的发展趋势。那些重洋轻土的人，实际上是把广大群众排斥在技术革命的大门之外。土洋问题，关系到要不要群众运动的问题。
    在普及的基础上提高
    在提高的指导下普及
    随着技术革命运动不断地深化，企业的生产技术计划管理等一系列工作，都会起着新的变化。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生。这就需要我们不断的改进领导工作，以适应新形势的要求，促进生产力向前飞跃。技术革命的洪峰起来之后，经常冲垮旧的平衡，新的不平衡又出现。旧的薄弱环节解决了，新的薄弱环节又发生。厂里有薄弱环节的车间，车间里有薄弱环节的工段，工段里有薄弱环节的小组，就是一条生产流水线上，也还有薄弱环节的工序。即使最先进的车间和工段也始终存在。领导者的任务，就是要善于引导群众，寻找薄弱环节，把技术革命的矛头针对这些薄弱环节。平衡是相对的，不平衡是绝对的，从不平衡到平衡，又从平衡到不平衡，正确的认识这个规律，才能领导技术革命运动正常的向前发展。
    技术革命运动遇到的另一个问题，就是普及与提高的关系问题，也就是尖端与一般革新的关系问题。群众发动起来后，一下子就涌现了成千上万条革新建议，这除了要以热情的态度对待外，还要有意识的引导群众向尖端的方向去努力。只有这样，才能在普及的基础上提高，又在提高的指导下普及。我们从工厂到科室、车间、小组，层层发动群众制订技术规划，把近期打算与长远方向结合起来。我们引导群众从实现机械化半机械化基础上，向自动化半自动化进军；从一般革新遍地开花的基础上，向尖端科学技术进军，从而出现了“人人献厚礼，天天出尖端”的新气象，试制成功了一些具有国际水平的新产品。为了在提高的指导下普及，集中群众智慧，组织广大群众向尖端技术进军，全厂广泛开展了“三结合”的科学研究活动，组织工人学习新技术，掀起了学习文化技术的新高潮，把技术革命与文化革命结合起来。现在已经建立起七十个科学研究小组，主要任务是研究当前技术革命的关键问题，向更高级的方向猛进。这是提高职工科学技术水平，组织群众猛攻尖端技术的一种有效形式。
    从单机自动化组成联动化，把几个工序联结成一条条生产流水线后，生产效率显著提高，组织生产的计划工作，就必须相应跟上，使每一条生产流水线都有饱满的工作量。产品的设计，更应不断地考虑零部件结构的通用性和标准化，以适应流水线成批生产特点，尽一切可能来减少调整设备的辅助工时。这就对设计人员
  和计划工作人员提出了新的任务。忽视了这一环节，都会使生产效率的提高受到影响。因为每一条生产流水线的闲置，就会造成十几个工序的同时停顿；一条联动化流水线闲置一分钟，就是意味着十几分钟工时闲置。此外，生活福
  利部门的托儿所、食堂、劳动保护、安全设施等方面都须及时采取措施。总之，我们以生产跃进为纲，抓住技术革命这条红线，推动企业的管理工作、文教工作、福利工作相应的跟上去，带动企业的全面跃进。

    总的来说，这一段时期的群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，在上级党委的领导下，是有成绩的。但按照新阶段、新形势、新任务对我们的要求，却还有很大的距离。我们将反复教育全厂干部和群众戒骄戒躁，永不自满，坚持贯彻不断革命的精神。在技术革命的宽敞大道上，是永无止境的，何况全厂尚有若干繁重手工操作，还可继续改为机械化；即使已经机械化的还可继续提高，向联动化、自动化的方向发展。目前，我们运用已经取得的技术革命运动的经验，自下而上的修订技术规划。一手抓今天，一手抓明天，既抓机械化程度的继续提高，又抓重点尖端项目的迅速实现。在这个伟大的时代，高举党的总路线的红旗，为实现今后的持续跃进而奋勇前进！
