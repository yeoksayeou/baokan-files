    Lush Tree-lined Avenue
    Zhu Mi

    Roadside trees are emerald lines embedded in the road, and many lines intersect to form a pleasant green network. This network divides the city into many quiet neighborhoods, and even the bustling scenes of traffic are submerged under this green line. All kinds of buildings, set off by the charming green line, are even more magnificent. What's more, many jewels are strung together on this green line - street parks and flower beds. All this harmony constitutes a vibrant street scene.
    Thousands of years ago, there were Qin Shihuang's "planting trees along the roads" and Cai Xiang's "planting pine trees along the roads." Thousands of years later, tree-lined avenues have become common in the greening, beautification, fragrance, and color enhancement of people's cities. Old cities appear younger because of the construction of tree-lined avenues, and new cities are born with tree-lined avenues accompanying them.
    This green network, which extensively interacts with citizens, decorates the entire city and silently does a lot of work for the city.
    Like many plants, it absorbs carbon dioxide discharged by people and inferior gases discharged by combustion, and exhales the oxygen essential for every life. In addition, it is like a cleaner, collecting a lot of dust around itself. It has been tested that each square meter of elm leaves can retain 3.39 grams of dust in one day and night.
    It also absorbs water from the depths of the soil and emits it into the air, moisturizing every pedestrian and harmonizing the air of the whole city. It has been estimated that every 100 kilograms of broad-leaved tree leaves can transpire 78,900 to 82,520 kilograms of water per year. Even the same weight of conifer leaves can transpire 13,488 to 11,307 kilograms of water per year.
    Noise is a bad thing that affects people's rest and health, but how can an active city have no noise at all? However, roadside trees are experts in eliminating noise. It has been measured that the noise on a high-rise building street with no trees is five times greater than that of a tree-lined avenue.
    In the scorching summer, the scorching sun pours a lot of heat energy onto the earth. Asphalt roads are sometimes hotter than the air by as much as five degrees, and the road surface becomes soft and even melts. Even in the early evening, the road surface and walls still emit scorching heat. But on the tree-lined avenue, it is a different scene. Take poplar trees as an example, 13% of the sunlight passing through it is reflected, 77% is absorbed, and only 10% manages to pass through, but it doesn't matter. Therefore, on the avenue, one tree is like a sunshade, and a row of trees is a green corridor. Roadside trees work silently.
    However, to be a valiant soldier in roadside trees, certain conditions are required: beauty, health, fast growth, regular leaf fall, and few pests and diseases, etc. Common ones include: London plane trees, poplars, locust trees, goldenrain trees, etc. However, China has a vast territory, and there must be many suitable tree species. In the future, there will surely be many beautiful, magnificent, and uniquely styled tree-lined avenues, making socialist cities even more magnificent and colorful.

    葱郁林荫道
    朱米
    行道树是嵌在马路上的翡翠线，许多线又交错成一个怡人的绿网，这个网，又把城市分割成许多宁静的小区，连那些车水马龙的繁杂景象也沉没在这绿线下。各式各样的建筑，受到迷人的绿线衬托，又添上几分绮丽。何况在这绿线上还串连着许多珠宝——街头公园、花圃。这和谐的一切，构成了一幅生意盎然的街景。
    几千年前，就有秦始皇“治道立木”和蔡襄公“夹道树松”之说。几千年后的今天，林荫大道已在人民城市的绿化、美化、香化和彩化中普遍出现了。老的城市由于兴建了林荫大道而显得年青，新的城市本来就有林荫大道伴着她诞生。
    这个与市民广泛打交道的绿网，她装饰着整个城市，还为城市默默地做着许多工作。
    她与许多植物一样，吸下人们排泄出的二氧化碳以及燃烧所排出的劣质气体，呼出每个生命所不可少的氧。此外她还像一个清洁工人那样，把许多灰尘收集到自己的身边。有人试验过，每一平方米榆树叶叶面上，一昼夜可以滞留三点三九克的灰尘。
    她还把土壤深处的水吸上来，并散发到空中去，滋润着每个行人，调和着全城的空气。有人估算过：每一百公斤的阔叶树的树叶，一年可蒸腾出七万八千九百至八万二千五百二十公斤的水。就是针叶树同样重量的树叶，一年还蒸腾一万三千四百八十八至一万一千三百零七公斤的水哪。
    噪音是影响人们休息与健康的坏东西，可是一个活跃的城市，又怎能一点噪音也没有呢。不过行道树却是消除噪音的能手。有人测定过说：在建筑物高大而没有树的大街上，比林荫大道的噪音要多五倍。
    炎夏的骄阳，把大量的热能倾泻到大地上，柏油马路有时热得比空气还能高出五度，路面就变软甚至有些熔化了。就是在初夜的时候，路面、墙壁还散发着炙人的热气。但是在林荫大道上却又是一个模样。就拿白杨树来说吧，经过它的太阳光，有13％被反射出去了，77％被吸收掉，只有10％侥幸地透过，但也无关紧要了。所以在大道上，一株树就是一柄遮阳伞，一行树就是一道绿色长廊。行道树就这么默默无声地工作着。
    不过要想在行道树中做一名慓悍的列兵，却需要一定的条件，那应该是：美丽、健壮、长的快、定期落叶、少有病虫害等等。常见的有：法国梧桐、白杨、洋槐、黄金树等。不过我国幅员广大，适用树种一定不少。将来一定会有许多美丽壮观而具有独特风格的各式林荫大道，使社会主义的城市更加绮丽多彩。
