Technical Innovation is a Sea of Red

	The motors sing joyfully,
	The furnace fires smile sweetly,
	Steelmaking has done away with shovels and picks,
	Steel flows in rolling red waves.
	The rolling mills rumble,
	Steel dragons dance in the sky,
	Only hear the machine roar,
	Steel materials densely push through nine layers.
	Blast furnaces tower into the sky,
	Blue smoke dances like the Milky Way,
	Charging and feeding are automated,
	Sitting on the ground, we watch the red sun rise.
	The steel city's war drums urge on,
	Innovation shows its divine power,
	Heroes wield the sword of wisdom together,
	Good news flies across the sky on wings.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company

	Tricks and Blossoms Bloom Everywhere
	There are no roads in the sky,
	But we can go up;
	There are no doors underground,
	But we can open them;
	As long as we greatly liberate our thinking,
	Tricks and blossoms will bloom everywhere.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Tianyuan Chemical Plant

	Ascending to the Blue Sky Through Clouds and Mist
	Layers of clouds and mist surround the mountain peaks,
	Tracks are laid among the white clouds,
	Cable cars carry goods through the clouds,
	Ascending to the blue sky through clouds and mist.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Port Authority

	Now the Carrying Pole is Useless Wood
	High mountains must bow their heads,
	Rivers make way on both sides,
	In the past, carrying poles burdened people,
	Now the carrying pole is useless wood.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Chaotianmen Loading and Unloading Station

	A Wall in the Blink of an Eye
	Little trowel, little trowel,
	It's time for you to rest this time,
	Putting you aside and not caring about you,
	I use my new big dipper, [Note]
	A wall in the blink of an eye,
	Red brick walls reach into the clouds.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company
	[Note] Big dipper is an advanced tool for plasterers,
    	which is four times more efficient than manual operation.

	Overturning Rivers and Seas in Innovation
	Navigation markers use electricity instead of oil,
	Chairman's instructions are kept in mind, [Note]
	Thousands of sailors are mobilized,
	Overturning rivers and seas in innovation;
	Automation of navigation vessels and markers,
	Day and night navigation for thousands of miles,
	Flowers bloom on the river,
	Like red lotuses that never fade.
    		-- Sichuan River Sailors
	[Note] In 1958, Chairman Mao took the Jiangxia ship from Chongqing to Wuhan. On the way, Chairman Mao said to the
   	crew, navigation markers can also be electrified.

	Even Chicken Feathers Can Fly to the Sky
	Even chicken feathers can fly to the sky,
	What's so difficult about building a business from scratch?
	Although empty-handed and bare-fisted,
	We can still accomplish great things!
	A spring breeze overnight brings forth a hundred grasses,
	Flowers of innovation bloom all over the garden.
 	-- Workers of Chongqing Zhongnan Rubber Factory

	Innovation with a Few Bamboo Poles
	In the past, carrying yellow starch powder,
	Sweat drenched our backs and clothes,
	Now we have a transport machine,
	Without machines and without electricity,
	Relying only on a few bamboo pipes,
	Production has increased four and a half times.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Xiangguosi Street Transportation Team

	Coal Shuttle Chute
	Ten thousand tons of black gold shuttle in the chute,
	Like a flying spring down a steep slope,
	Barges with open bellies swallow their fill,
	The river water happily turns into golden waves.
	-- Workers of Chongqing Port Authority

    技术革新一片红
    马达唱得欢，
    炉火笑得甜，
    炼钢丢掉扒和锹，
    钢流滚滚红浪翻。
    轧机轰隆隆，
    钢龙舞长空，
    只听机器一声吼，
    钢材密密推九重。
    高炉耸九霄，
    青烟银河舞，
    装料进料联动化，
    平地坐观红日吐。
    钢城战鼓催，
    革新显神威，
    英雄齐挥智慧剑，
    捷报长翅满天飞。
    ——重庆钢铁公司工人	窍门花朵处处开
    天上没有路，
    我们上得去；
    地下没有门，
    我们打得开；
    只要思想大解放，
    窍门花朵处处开。
    ——重庆天原化工厂工人
      穿过云雾上青天
    层层云雾绕山巅，
    轨道铺在白云间，
    缆车儎货云上走，
    穿过云雾上青天。
    ——重庆港务局工人
    如今扁担废木头
    高山一定要低头，
    河水让路两边流，
    从前扁担压人走，
    如今扁担废木头。
    ——重庆朝天门搬运站工人
      眼睛一眨一匹墙
    小瓦刀呀小瓦刀，
    这次你该休息了，
    搁在一边不管你，
    我用我的新大瓢，〔注〕
    眼睛一眨一匹墙，
    红色砖墙入云霄。
    ——重庆钢铁公司工人
  〔注〕大瓢即瓦工铺灰先进工具，
      比手工操作工效高四倍。
    翻江倒海闹革新
    航标电气不用油，
    领袖指示记心头，〔注〕
    万千海员齐上阵，
    翻江倒海闹革新；
    航舶航标自动化，
    日夜通航里万程，
    江上鲜花朵朵开，
    恰似红莲开不败。
          ——川江海员
    〔注〕1958年毛主席乘江峡轮由重庆至武汉，途中，毛主席对
  船员说，航标也能搞电气化。
      鸡毛也能飞上天
    鸡毛也能飞上天，
    白手兴家有何难，
    虽然赤手与空拳，
    同样能把大事办！
    一夜春风百草生，
    革新花朵开满园。
     ——重庆中南橡胶厂工人
      几根竹竿闹革新
    从前担着黄浆粉，
    汗流夹背湿衣衫，
    如今有了运输机，
    不用机器不用电，
    仅靠几根竹管管，
    生产提高四倍半。
    ——重庆相国寺街道运
            输队工人
      煤　梭　槽
    万吨乌金槽内梭，
    犹如飞泉下陡坡，
    船驳敞肚吞个够，
    江水乐得翻金波。
    ——重庆港务局工人
