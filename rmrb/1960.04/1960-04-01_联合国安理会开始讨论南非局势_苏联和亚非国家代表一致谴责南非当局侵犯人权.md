Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 31st: At the request of the representatives of twenty-nine Asian-African countries, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 30th to discuss the situation created by the large-scale massacre of peaceful African residents by the government of the Union of South Africa. Representatives of Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and the Union of South Africa were invited to participate in the Security Council meeting.

After the adoption of the meeting agenda, the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy spoke, attempting to cast doubt on whether the Security Council had the right to discuss the situation in the Union of South Africa, under the pretext that the Security Council's discussion of this issue would constitute interference by the United Nations in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Soviet representative Sobolev refuted the arguments of the British, French, and Italian representatives. Sobolev believed that the Security Council should listen to the voices of many member states of the United Nations.

Sobolev pointed out that the recent events in this region of Africa fully demonstrate that the call by twenty-nine Asian-African countries for world public attention to the policies of the Union of South Africa authorities is entirely justified, because such policies not only lead to violations of human rights, but also pose a threat to peace and security on the African continent.

    联合国安理会开始讨论南非局势
    苏联和亚非国家代表一致谴责南非当局侵犯人权
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会应亚非二十九个国家代表的请求，30日举行会议讨论南非联邦政府大规模屠杀非洲和平居民所造成的局势，被邀请参加安理会会议的有加纳、几内亚、利比里亚、印度、巴基斯坦、埃塞俄比亚和南非联邦的代表。
    在通过了会议议程以后，英国、法国和意大利代表发言，他们在所谓安全理事会对这个问题的讨论将构成联合国对一个主权国家的内政的干涉的借口下，竭力对安全理事会是否有权讨论南非联邦局势散布怀疑。苏联代表索波列夫驳斥了英、法、意三国代表的论调。索波列夫认为，安全理事会应当听取联合国许多会员国的呼声。
    索波列夫指出，最近在非洲这一地区所发生的事件完全表明亚非二十九个国家呼吁世界公众注意南非联邦当局的政策是完全正当的，因为这种政策不仅导致了侵犯人权，而且还对和平和非洲大陆的安全造成威胁。
