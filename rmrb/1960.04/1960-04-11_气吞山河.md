A Spirit That Swallows Mountains and Rivers
    Wang Manyuan, Secretary of the Zhaonan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province

    The Taiping People's Commune in Zhaonan County, Fujian Province, is attracting attention throughout the province for its high-speed development of Wanbao Mountain. In the past year, it has reclaimed more than 25,000 mu of barren mountains and afforested 63,800 mu with fruit trees and forests. This greatly exceeded the original plan of four "wans," namely, wan mu of forest, wan mu of fruit, wan mu of bamboo, and wan mu of oil-tea camellias. Developing the mountain economy at the high speed of "one year of mountain management surpassing a hundred years" is indeed a model for developing Wanbao Mountain.

    Zoummatang in Taiping Commune has always been famous for its rich experience in cultivating mandarin oranges in mountainous areas. In fact, in the past, only more than 500 mu of mountain land was used for growing mandarin oranges, and this was only developed through more than 100 years of hard work by our ancestors.

    Our ancestors developed and managed more than 500 mu of mandarin oranges in more than 100 years. This is a certain rate of production. Today, in the people's commune, the place is still there, but in just one year, more than 60,000 mu of mountain land has been developed and planted with large areas of fruit trees, bamboo, oil-tea camellias, and forests (of which fruit trees account for more than 15,000 mu). This is another rate of production. If we compare the high production rate of Taiping Commune with the small production rate of our ancestors, the time ratio is one year to one hundred years; the area of fruit tree planting is a ratio of 15,000 mu to 500 mu, which is thirty times greater.

    In order to welcome the first spring of the 1960s and achieve a "flying start" in mountain management, Taiping Commune reclaimed more than 26,000 mu of barren mountains at an even higher speed in just 70 days. Across the hundred-li radius of the myriad mountain peaks, neatly arranged and heavily layered terraced fields appeared everywhere, one layer after another, one mountain connected to another, in an orderly manner. The mountains are full of green pines and verdant bamboo, and the land is covered with blossoming fruit gardens. Barren hills have been transformed into Wanbao Mountain.

    Things are constantly developing. Taiping Commune's development of Wanbao Mountain is also constantly developing from small to large and from low to high. After the hard work of the last three months of last year and the first three months of this year, the commune has reclaimed a total of more than 50,000 mu of barren mountains.

    The speed with which Taiping Commune is developing Wanbao Mountain has broken all kinds of superstitions. Some people say that the yield of agricultural crops can increase at a high speed, but the development of the mountain economy can only proceed "step by step" and not at a high speed. Some people believe that "the more land is reclaimed, the quality will not be guaranteed." The experience of Taiping Commune in developing mountainous areas fully proves that it can be both high-speed and high-quality. The question is whether to highly combine and unify the soaring revolutionary drive and the infinite wisdom of the masses.

    From the vivid facts of Taiping Commune's development of Wanbao Mountain, we can see a very valuable communist style and spirit of continuous revolution. The people of Taiping Commune have fully exerted the superiority of the people's commune being large in scale and high in the degree of public ownership. They have been liberated from the small-scale, piecemeal, handicraft-style methods that hampered the development of productive forces. Taiping Commune organized large-scale corps operations, implemented full mobilization, everyone got involved, and they took advantage of the momentum to seize brilliant victories. After one battle victory, they immediately organized another battle, which made the mass movement more powerful each time, with one upsurge pushing another.

    Changing the face of the countryside and realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule requires a full-scale offensive against nature. This is the glorious mission of the great era of the people's communes. Mountains, desolate and rich mountains, contain infinite wealth. In the past few thousand years, our ancestors "looked at the treasure mountain in vain and could do nothing." But today, in this era of people's communes, people want to conquer it. The pioneers of Taiping Commune used their bold words and wrote a couplet. The first line is: "The whole people are mobilized to transform nature." The second line is: "Thousands of troops and horses conquer barren mountains." The horizontal inscription is: "A Spirit That Swallows Mountains and Rivers!" In the face of this heroic spirit, after a spring breeze, barren hills and ridges that have been sleeping for thousands of years will, in the blink of an eye, become Wanbao Mountains that benefit the people and benefit future generations.

    气吞山河	中共福建诏安县委书记　王满元
    以高速度开发万宝山为福建全省瞩目的诏安太平公社，在去年一年之间，开垦荒山二万五千多亩，造林种果木六万三千八百亩。大大超过了原订的四个“万”，即万亩林、万亩果、万亩竹、万亩油茶的计划，以“一年治山超百年”的高速度发展山区经济，这的确是开发万宝山的典范。
    太平公社的走马塘，一直就以山地栽培柑桔具有丰富经验而著名，其实过去也只有五百多亩山地让柑桔上山，而这些还是经过我们的祖先一百多年辛勤劳动才经营开发出来的。
    我们祖先开发经营了一百多年留下五百多亩柑桔，这是个生产速度；人民公社的今天，地方也还是在那里，可是仅仅用了一年时间，就开发了六万多亩山地，种上了大片大片的果、竹、油茶、林木（其中果树占一万五千多亩），这又是一个生产速度。若以太平公社的大生产的速度和我们祖宗的小生产的速度相对比，时间是一年与一百年之比；果树种植面积是一万五千亩和五百亩之比，是三十倍。
    太平公社为了迎接六十年代的第一个春天，实现治山“开门红”，以更高的速度在短短的七十天中，又开垦了荒山二万六千多亩。方圆百里的万座山峰，到处出现整整齐齐、重重叠叠的梯田，一层接一层，一山连一山，井然有序。满山是青松翠竹，遍地是花果满园，荒山秃岭变成了万宝山。
    事物是不断发展的。太平公社的开发万宝山也是从少到多、由低到高而不断发展起来的。经过去年最后三个月和今年开头三个月的苦战，全社共开荒山五万多亩。
    太平公社开发万宝山的速度破除了形形色色的迷信。有人说，农作物产量可以高速度增加，开发山区经济只能“按部就班”，不能高速度；有的人认为“开荒多，质量就没有保证”。太平公社开发山区的经验，完全证明可以既是高速度，又是高质量。问题就在于是否把革命的冲天干劲和群众的无穷智慧高度结合、高度统一起来。
    我们从太平公社开发万宝山的生动事实中，可以看到一种极为可贵的共产主义风格和不断革命的精神。太平公社的人们充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，已经从束缚生产力发展的小手小脚、零打碎敲的小手工业式的方法中解放出来。太平公社组织大兵团作战，实行全面动员，人人动手，一鼓作气，夺取了辉煌战果。他们在一个战役胜利之后紧跟着就组织另一个战役，这就使群众运动声势一次比一次大，一个高潮又推动了另一个高潮。
    改变农村面貌，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，必须向大自然展开全面进攻，这是伟大的人民公社时代的光荣使命。山，荒凉而又富饶的山，蕴藏着无穷财富，过去几千年，我们的祖先“空望宝山莫奈何”，可是在今天这人民公社的时代，人们要把它征服。太平公社的拓荒者用他们的豪言壮语，写下一副对联。上联是：“全民动员改造自然”下联是“千军万马征服荒山”。横额是：“气吞山河”！在这种英雄气概面前，一座座沉睡千年的荒山秃岭，在东风吹过之后，转眼之间，便成造福人民、造福子孙的万宝山了。
