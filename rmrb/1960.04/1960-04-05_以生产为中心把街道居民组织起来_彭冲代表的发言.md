Organizing Street Residents Around Production
Speech by Representative Peng Chong

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and will resolutely implement them based on the tasks proposed in the reports. Now, I would like to express my views on the issue of Nanjing organizing urban street residents comprehensively, centering on the development of production.

A New Social Productive Force Has Emerged

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the mass movement of the whole people running industry has surged in Nanjing, and street industry has become a new social productive force. Like stars in the sky, it is dazzling and adds wings to industrial production, multiplying its strength. At present, there are more than 4,000 street production units in the city, including 1,745 street factories, 2,148 residential production groups, 122 transportation teams, and 118 construction teams, with more than 130,000 residents participating in production. Street industries cover more than ten sectors, including chemical industry, telecommunications instruments, hardware machinery, metal smelting, building materials, glass instruments, wooden furniture, printing and binding, textiles, sewing, and food processing. Products include transformers, electric motors, wire drawing machines, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, electrolytic copper, medical light bulbs, high-frequency porcelain, and radio instrument components such as loudspeakers, some of which have reached advanced domestic levels in quality. In January and February this year, the total output value and processing fees of street industries in the city amounted to 213 million yuan, an increase of twelve times compared with the same period last year. Before liberation, Nanjing was a typical consumer city. In 1949, the total industrial output value of the city for the whole year was only more than 50 million yuan. But now? The output value and processing fees of street industries alone in two months are equivalent to four times the total industrial output value of the city for the whole year in 1949. This is a tremendous, earth-shaking change.

The development of street industry has driven the overall development of street collective welfare and service undertakings. At present, there are 1,770 street public canteens, 2,128 people-run nurseries and kindergartens, 19 homes for the elderly, and 926 service stations, providing hundreds of service items such as laundry, sewing, hairdressing, patient care, cooking, letter writing, handling savings, collecting waste products, and selling some commodities on commission. Many streets have also established hospitals (clinics), general stores, clubs, bathhouses, and reading rooms. The development of these undertakings has provided extremely favorable conditions for street residents to participate in production and directly helped the continuous development of street production undertakings.

Street industry is the product of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. Like any new thing, once it appears, it shows strong vitality. Over the past year, street industries have played a significant role in serving large industries, the lives of urban and rural people, agriculture, and exports. Many street factories in the city have established relatively fixed processing relationships with large factories, supplying raw materials or using scrap materials from large factories to produce various parts, components, and even complete sets of machinery. For example, many parts and components of the Panda brand radios, which sell well at home and abroad, are manufactured and processed by street factories. Last year, street smelting factories in the city extracted more than 3,000 tons of metals such as copper, lead, aluminum, and tin from the garbage of large factories. Street industries manufacture parts and components for large industries, which enables large factories to free up resources to produce more advanced, precise, and sophisticated products, and cultivate a technical reserve force for large factories, powerfully supporting large industrial production; and the support of large enterprises to street industries in terms of technology, equipment, raw materials, and materials is also an important condition for the continuous development of street industries. This mutual support and cooperation can allow each to get what they need and leap forward together. In 1959, more than 60% of the small hardware and small commodities produced in the city were produced by street industries. The construction teams run by the streets also undertake the heavy task of repairing and renovating houses and transforming homes in the city.

Now, more than 90% of the street residents in the city have participated in various production and social service labor, most of whom are housewives. They have been liberated from housework and have taken up production posts, becoming the main force in street production and service undertakings. For thousands of years, the desire of the broad masses of women to achieve complete liberation politically and economically has been realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They sing joyfully: "The whole party and the whole people run industry, we women are greatly liberated, put down the washboard and leave the stove, walk out of the house and enter the factory, never forget Chairman Mao, and actively work to repay the Party." The old, the weak, and the blind, deaf, mute, and disabled in the streets have also participated in labor within their capabilities, achieving "the elderly are not old and declining, and the disabled are not disabled and useless."

Overall Great Leap in Industry, Service Undertakings, Culture, Education and Health

After the broad masses of street residents participated in social labor, they urgently demanded to learn culture and improve their skills, and the development of various collective welfare and service undertakings provided more learning opportunities for the masses. Therefore, the upsurge of the whole people running industry has also brought about an upsurge of the whole people running schools. At present, there are more than 200 people-run primary and secondary schools in the city, with more than 30,000 students enrolled. At the same time, spare-time cultural schools have been widely established.

The development of street production and service undertakings has greatly improved the lives of the broad masses of residents. In 1959, the personnel participating in street production and service undertakings in the city received a total of more than 15 million yuan in wages. People who originally needed relief can now support themselves with their own labor. Over the past year, street residents have built 7,600 simple tile houses (more than 146,000 square meters) on their own initiative, including both one-story and multi-story buildings. Many shantytowns have been transformed into beautiful new neighborhoods with factories, schools, hospitals, public canteens, and nurseries in a short period of time.

The great development of street industry and cultural, educational, health, and service undertakings has also brought about profound changes in the political consciousness and mental outlook of street residents. A new atmosphere of everyone working, every household producing, learning from each other, catching up with each other, unity, mutual assistance, and being as close as a family has become widespread. The content of street work has become richer and more comprehensive.

"Of the thousands of street work tasks, developing production is the most important." Leading production has become an outstanding central task. Many street cadres have become experts in organizing production. Under the unified leadership of the street Party committee, the street offices have become not only administrative management organs but also unified organizers of the production and welfare of street residents. All of this fully demonstrates that under the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the urban street work has begun to enter a new stage.

The great leap forward of street production and welfare undertakings is first and foremost the result of launching a mass movement under the leadership of the Party. In May 1958, according to the Party's General Line and the principle of "walking on two legs," we launched a mass movement of the whole people running industry throughout the city. Because this movement fully conformed to the urgent demands of the broad masses of residents, it immediately showed a situation of a call for action and widespread blooming. Originally, some people believed that street residents running industry had no funds, no equipment, no technology, and no experience, and felt that there were many difficulties and little confidence. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses displayed the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, showing the heroic spirit of "not fearing heaven, not fearing earth, and creating the world with bare hands." All these difficulties were overcome one by one. If there was no money, everyone pooled it; if there were no houses, everyone gave way; if there was no equipment, everyone looked for it; if there was no technology, they studied hard. In this way, in a short period of time, thousands of street factories were established throughout the city. Taking the Dongfeng Machinery Factory of the Dingjiaqiao Street Office in Gulou District as an example, this factory was started by five housewives through hard work and frugality. Now it is a hardware factory with more than 300 employees, more than 30 machine tools and equipment, and the ability to produce more than ten products such as various types of pliers and alloy needles. As they themselves said: "Visiting large factories everywhere to find, searching for treasures in waste piles, three pairs of pliers and four files, determined to build a lathe, the bed surface is uneven and dragged on the road, if the file does not work, it is ground by hand, taking advantage of the east wind to inspire great ambitions, and the phoenix comes from a small chicken coop." The development process of the Shuangleyuan Smelting Factory in Qinhuai District is also very moving. Some of the residents in this area used to make a living by scavenging garbage and knew something about metal smelting. As soon as they heard the Party's call to launch a mass movement to run industry, they organized a hardware smelting group with 16 people. If there was no money and no tools, they tried to put them together. If there was no factory building, they started the furnace in the open air. In the summer, their backs were peeled from the sun, and on rainy days, they were covered with a piece of broken sack. They never complained and worked harder and harder. Over the past year, like a snowball, it has developed into a comprehensive factory with nearly 200 people and more than ten production projects. The development path of Dongfeng Machinery Factory and Shuangleyuan Smelting Factory is also the road taken by street industries throughout the city. It vividly shows how much vitality the policy of running industry frugally and relying on self-reliance has.

Organizing Production According to Local Conditions and Needs, With Both Centralization and Decentralization

Street industrial production takes the form of mainly centralized, combining centralization and decentralization, and flexibly applying it according to local conditions and needs. Generally speaking, centralized production is easy to manage, easy to learn and promote new technologies, and also easy for factories to further develop and improve. This form is suitable for production units with relatively fixed products and relatively complex production processes. For those with greater seasonality and temporality and simpler production processes, decentralized production methods can be adopted so that housewives who only have a few hours of free time each day can also participate in production. The good combination of these two methods can maximize the organization of social labor and serve socialist construction.

Continuous development and continuous consolidation are the guarantee for the healthy development of street industries. In 1958, thousands of production units were established throughout the city in just a few months. Due to the rapid development and short time, and the lack of experience in running industry by the whole people, some shortcomings and problems inevitably arose in organization and management. In 1959, the city transferred nearly a thousand cadres to form specialized offices and work groups to carry out a movement to rectify street industries centered on strengthening Party leadership, raising mass awareness, and doing a good job in production; and transferred a large number of cadres to enrich the grassroots street organizations. This not only purified and strengthened the organization but also ushered in a new upsurge of running street industries and service undertakings on an even larger scale. At present, we are launching a mass movement of mechanizing and semi-mechanizing manual operations in street industries; and further studying and resolving issues such as accumulation and distribution. It is estimated that within this year, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of street industries can be increased from the current 10% to more than 40%, and the face of street industries will have a more significant change, not only greatly increasing production capacity but also producing more advanced products.

Gradually Expanding the Scope of Socialization of Household Labor

Centering on the development of production and equipping the collective welfare, social services, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings of the streets in a complete set is the key to comprehensively organizing urban residents. When the broad masses of street residents are organized in terms of production, their original lifestyles are no longer adapted, and they urgently demand to be organized in terms of life and to socialize household labor. In order to adapt to the needs of this situation, while vigorously developing street production, we have launched large-scale activities to organize the economic life of the people. Focusing on running public canteens, nurseries, and service stations well, we plan to equip the collective welfare, cultural, educational, health, and service undertakings of the streets in a complete set. It is required that each street office not only run canteens, nurseries, and service stations well but also universally establish hospitals (clinics), homes for the elderly, general stores, as well as recreational and sports organizations such as reading rooms, clubs, amateur sports teams, and amateur art teams; gradually establish an employee spare-time education system from primary school to high school; actively carry out greening, patriotic hygiene, and home renovation work; vigorously develop sideline production such as poultry and livestock; further improve the militia organization, and strengthen public security work.

Through two years of practice, we have deeply realized that organizing urban street residents around the development of production is an important way to mobilize all positive factors and accelerate the construction of a new type of socialist city, and it is also a fundamental issue that must be resolved in urban work. As early as 1943, Chairman Mao instructed us in his speech "Get Organized!" to "organize the masses, mobilize all the strength of the people, all the strength of the army organs and schools, all the labor force and semi-labor force of men and women, old and young, as long as it is possible, without exception, and organize them into a labor army." "This is the only way for the people to be liberated, the only way to change from poverty to prosperity." The development of history fully proves the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, China's rural areas have already entered the era of the great People's Commune through the road of cooperatives. In the cities, the originally scattered street residents have now and are embarking on the road of collectivization of production and life, which has created mature conditions for the birth of urban People's Communes. We believe that under the brilliant illumination of the "Three Red Banners," the urban work of Nanjing, like that of fraternal cities across the country, will soon show an unprecedentedly new situation.

### 以生产为中心把街道居民组织起来  彭冲代表的发言

专栏：

    以生产为中心把街道居民组织起来
    彭冲代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理所作的报告，并根据报告中所提的任务坚决贯彻执行。现在，我就南京市以发展生产为中心，把城市街道居民全面地组织起来的问题，发表一点意见。
    一支新兴的社会生产力量出现了
    大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，南京全民办工业的群众运动风起云涌，街道工业已经成为一种新兴的社会生产力量。它像满天星斗一样，光彩夺目，使整个工业生产如虎添翼，力量倍增。目前，全市街道生产事业已有四千多个单位，其中街道工厂一千七百四十五个，居民生产组二千一百四十八个，交通运输队一百二十二个，建筑队一百一十八个，参加生产的居民达十三万多人。街道工业有化工、电讯仪表、五金机械、金属冶炼、建筑材料、玻璃仪器、木器家具、印刷装订、纺织、缝纫、食品加工等十多个行业。产品有一千多种，包括变压器、电动机、拉丝机、盐酸、烧碱、电解铜、医疗灯泡及高频瓷、扬声器等无线电仪表元件，其中有些产品的质量已经达到国内先进水平。今年1、2月份，全市街道工业的产值和加工费共为二亿一千三百万元，比去年同期增长十二倍。解放前，南京是一个典型的消费城市，1949年全市全年工业总产值只有五千多万元。而现在呢？仅仅街道工业，两个月的产值和加工费，就相等于1949年全市全年工业总产值的四倍。这是多么巨大的翻天覆地的变化。
    街道工业的发展，带动了街道集体福利和服务事业的全面大发展，目前，全市共有街道公共食堂一千七百七十所，民办托儿所、幼儿园二千一百二十八所，敬老院十九所，服务站九百二十六个，有洗衣、缝纫、理发、护理病人、作饭、写信、代办储蓄、收购废品和代销一部分商品等成百个服务项目。还有不少街道建立了医院（医疗所）、综合商店、俱乐部、浴室、阅览室。这些事业的发展，都为街道居民参加生产提供了极为有利的条件，直接帮助了街道生产事业的不断发展。
    街道工业是总路线和大跃进的产物。它和任何新生事物一样，一经出现，就日益显示出强大的生命力。一年多来，街道工业在为大工业、为城乡人民生活、为农业、为出口服务方面发挥了很大的作用。全市很多街道工厂，都和大工厂建立了比较固定的加工关系，由大工厂供给原材料或利用大厂的边材废料，生产各种零件，部件以至成套的机器。例如，畅销国内外市场的熊猫牌收音机，就有好些零件、部件是由街道工厂制造、加工的。去年，全市街道冶炼工厂，从大厂垃圾中提炼出来的铜、铅、铝、锡等金属就有三千多吨。街道工业为大工业制造零件和部件，就使大厂能够腾出手来生产更多的高级、精密、尖端产品，并且为大厂培养了技术后备力量，有力地支援了大工业生产；而大型企业对街道工业在技术、设备、原料、材料上的支援，也是街道工业不断发展的重要条件。这样互相支援，互相协作，可以各得其所，共同跃进。1959年，全市生产的小五金、小百货，有60％以上是街道工业生产的。街道办的建筑队，也担负着全市民房修缮、改建家园的繁重任务。
    现在，全市街道居民已经有90％以上参加了各种生产和社会服务劳动，其中绝大部分是家庭妇女。她们从家务劳动中解放出来，走上了生产岗位，成为街道生产、服务事业中的主力军。几千年来，广大妇女要求在政治上、经济上获得彻底解放的愿望，已经在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下实现了。她们心花怒放地歌唱道：“全党全民办工业，我们妇女大解放，放下搓板离锅旁，走出家门进工厂，终身不忘毛主席，积极劳动报答党。”街道上的老、弱和盲、聋、哑、残人等也参加了力所能及的劳动，做到了“老年人老而不衰，残废人残而不废”。
    工业、服务事业、文教卫生全面大高涨
    在广大街道居民参加社会劳动之后，迫切要求学习文化、提高技术，而各种集体福利和服务事业的发展，又为群众提供了更多的学习机会。因此，全民办工业的高潮也带来了全民办学的热潮。现在，全市的民办中小学已经有二百多所，入学人数达三万多人。同时还普遍兴办了业余文化学校。
    街道生产、服务事业的发展，大大改善了广大居民群众的生活。1959年，全市参加街道生产和服务事业的人员，共领得工资一千五百多万元。原来需要救济的人，都可以用自己的劳动来养活自己了。一年多来，街道居民因陋就简自己动手改建的瓦房就有七千六百多间，（十四万六千多平方米），有平房，有楼房。不少棚户区都在短短时间内焕然一新，变成了有工厂、学校、医院、公共食堂、托儿所的环境幽美的新街坊。
    街道工业和文教卫生、服务事业的大发展，也使街道居民的政治觉悟和精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。人人劳动、户户生产、互相学习、你追我赶、团结互助、亲如一家的新风气已经普遍形成。街道工作的内容更加丰富、全面了。
  “街道工作千万条，发展生产第一条。”领导生产已经成为突出的中心工作。很多街道干部已经成为组织生产的能手。在街道党委的统一领导下，街道办事处已经不仅是管理行政事务的机关，同时也成为街道居民生产和生活福利的统一组织者。所有这些，都充分说明了：在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜下，城市的街道工作已经开始进入了一个新的阶段。
    街道生产福利事业的大跃进，首先是在党的领导下大搞群众运动的结果。1958年5月间，我们根据党的总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针，在全市范围掀起了一个全民办工业的群众运动。由于这个运动完全符合广大居民群众的迫切要求，一开始就出现了一呼百应、遍地开花的局面。原来有些人认为：街道居民办工业，一无资金，二无设备，三无技术，四无经验，感到困难重重，信心不大。但是，在党的领导下广大群众发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，表现了“天不怕、地不怕，赤手空拳创天下”的英雄气概。所有这些困难一一克服了。没有资金大家凑，没有房子大家让，没有设备大家找，没有技术刻苦学。就这样，在短短的时间内，全市办起了千百个街道工厂。以鼓楼区丁家桥办事处东风机械厂为例，这个工厂就是五个家庭妇女穷办苦干起来的。现在已经是一个有三百多名职工、三十多台机床设备、能够生产各种型号的老虎钳、合金针等十多种产品的五金工厂了。正如他们自己所说的：“遍访大厂四处找，废料堆里来寻宝，三把钳子四把锉，决心要把车床造，床面不平马路拖，锉子不行用手磨，乘着东风鼓大志，凤凰出自小鸡窝。”秦淮区双乐园冶炼厂的发展过程也是非常动人的。这个地方的一部分居民过去是以淘垃圾为生的，懂得一些金属冶炼的知识。他们一听到党提出全民大办工业的号召，就组织了一个有十六个人参加的五金冶炼组，没有钱，没有工具，就设法拼凑。没有厂房，就露天开炉。夏天背上晒脱了皮，雨天顶上一块破麻包，从来不叫苦，越干越起劲。一年多来，像滚雪球似的，发展成为一个近二百人、有十多个生产项目的综合工厂。东风机械厂和双乐园冶炼厂的发展道路，也就是全市街道工业所走的道路。它生动地显示了穷办苦干、自力更生的方针具有多么巨大的生命力。
    因人因事制宜组织生产有集中也有分散
    街道工业的生产，是采取以集中为主、集中和分散相结合的形式，因人因事制宜，灵活运用。一般说来，集中生产便于管理，便于学习和推广新技术，也便于工厂进一步发展和提高，这种形式适合于产品比较固定、生产过程比较复杂的生产单位。对于季节性、临时性较大，生产过程比较简单的，可以采取分散生产的办法，使那些每天只有几小时空闲时间的家庭妇女也能够参加生产。这两种方式很好地结合起来，就可以把社会上的劳动力最大限度地组织起来，为社会主义建设服务。
    不断发展，不断巩固，是街道工业健康发展的保证。1958年，全市在短短的几个月内，就建立起成千个生产单位。由于发展很快，时间较短，缺乏全民办工业的经验，在组织管理等方面难免产生一些缺点和问题。1959年，全市抽调了近千名干部，组成专门的办公机构和工作组，开展了以加强党的领导、提高群众觉悟、搞好生产为中心的整顿街道工业的运动；并抽调大批干部，充实了街道基层组织。这样做不仅纯洁和健全了组织，而且出现了一个声势更大的大办街道工业和服务事业的新高潮。目前我们正在街道工业中，大搞手工操作机械化半机械化的群众运动；并进一步研究解决积累分配等问题。预计在今年之内，街道工业的机械化半机械化水平，可以由现在的10％提高到40％以上，街道工业的面貌将有一个更加显著的改变，不仅生产能力可以大大提高，而且可以生产更多高级的产品。
    逐渐扩大家务劳动社会化的范围
    以发展生产为中心，把街道的集体福利、社会服务和文教卫生事业成套地配备起来，是把城市居民全面地组织起来的关键。当广大街道居民从生产上组织起来以后，他们原来的生活方式就不相适应了，而迫切要求在生活上组织起来，使家务劳动社会化。为了适应这一形势的需要，我们在大力发展街道生产的同时，开展了大规模的组织人民经济生活的活动。以办好公共食堂、托儿所和服务站为重点，有计划地把街道的集体福利、文教卫生和服务事业成套地配备起来。要求每一个街道办事处不仅要办好食堂、托儿所和服务站，而且要普遍设立医院（医疗所）、敬老院、综合商店以及阅览室、俱乐部、业余体育队、业余文艺队等文娱体育组织，逐步建立起从初小到高中的职工业余教育体系；积极进行绿化、爱国卫生、改造家园的工作；大力发展家禽家畜等副业生产；进一步健全民兵组织，加强治安保卫工作。
    经过两年来的实践，我们深深体会到：以发展生产为中心，把城市街道居民组织起来，是调动一切积极因素，加速建设社会主义新型城市的重要途径，也是城市工作中必须解决的一个根本问题。早在1943年，毛主席就在“组织起来”的演讲中指示我们，要“把群众组织起来，把一切老百姓的力量、一切部队机关学校的力量、一切男女老少的全劳动力半劳动力，只要是可能的，就要毫无例外地动员起来，组织起来，成为一支劳动大军。”“这是人民群众得到解放的必由之路，由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。历史的发展完全证明了毛主席指示的英明、正确。现在，我国农村已经通过合作社的道路，进入了伟大的人民公社的时代。在城市中，原来分散的街道居民，现在也已经和正在走上生产、生活集体化的道路，这就为城市人民公社的诞生创造了成熟的条件。我们相信，在“三面红旗”的光辉照耀下，南京的城市工作，将与全国各兄弟城市一样，即将出现一个前所未有的崭新的局面。
