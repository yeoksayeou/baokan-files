    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 17th: All major Burmese-language newspapers in Rangoon today published editorials and articles, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma and enthusiastically hailing Sino-Burmese friendship.
    "Han Chiao Yueh Li Pao" pointed out: "The great significance of this year's Thingyan festival in Rangoon lies in the participation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China and his entourage."
    The article continued: "Sino-Burmese relations, following the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been smooth. Moreover, it has been possible not only to successfully conclude an agreement on border issues, but also to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries. Burma cannot forget that this has been possible because Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the People's Republic of China have shown magnanimity and a desire for friendship with Burma."
    "The Nation" stated in its editorial: "The friendly and warm participation of guests from our neighboring country in the Thingyan festival heralds further strengthening of friendship between the two countries in the future."
    "Kyemon" said that the successful conclusion of the border agreement and the treaty of non-aggression between China and Burma "is a milestone in the friendship and solidarity of Asian countries. It is an achievement in upholding the Bandung principles. Moreover, it also contributes to Asian and world peace."
    The newspaper added: "Just as we are now celebrating the achievements of friendship between the two countries, the visit of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to Burma is an excellent omen."
    The newspaper expressed the hope that the Sino-Indian border issue will be resolved smoothly.
    "Burma Times," in an editorial entitled "Dawn of the New Year," said: "This kind of friendly and amicable relationship between neighboring countries can bring peace and prosperity. Therefore, efforts should also be made to further improve and strengthen this friendly and amicable relationship."
    The editorial emphasized that the Bandung Conference stipulated several principles that allow countries, despite their different ideologies, to coexist peacefully and amicably. "As long as the Bandung principles are adhered to, countries can coexist in peace and friendship."
    The newspaper said: "Because Burma and China are two countries that follow the Bandung principles, they have not only been able to smoothly resolve the border issue, but also to conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression."
    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 17th: Rangoon's English and Burmese newspapers continue to give prominent coverage to the news and photos of Premier Zhou Enlai's activities here. Today, the English-language "Guardian" featured a report on Premier Zhou's participation in the Thingyan festival on its front page, with the headline: "Zhou (Enlai) and (U) Nu Participate in Rangoon Thingyan," "Visiting 'Pauk Phaw' Joyfully Sprinkles Water in Burmese Capital." Published alongside the report was a three-column photo showing Premier Zhou Enlai receiving flowers from a Burmese girl upon his arrival in Rangoon. Two other photos on the front page showed Premier Zhou wearing Burmese clothing and participating in the Thingyan festival.
    The English-language "Nation" also gave prominent front-page coverage to the news of Premier Zhou Enlai's arrival in Rangoon and his activities after arrival, with the headline "Chinese Premier Arrives, Celebrates Thingyan," "Sails on River, Attends Official Banquet."
    The Burmese-language "Yangon Daily" devoted almost the entire front page to news of the state banquet and Premier Zhou Enlai's meeting with Burmese President U Win Maung yesterday.
    "Kyemon" published two photos of Premier Zhou Enlai and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu happily participating in the Thingyan festival celebrations.
    "Thun Daily" featured news of Premier Zhou Enlai's arrival on the front page, with the banner headline "Premier Zhou Enlai Arrives in Rangoon."
    "The Nation" published the full text of speeches by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu at Rangoon Airport, headlined "Unity and World Peace," with the sub-headline "Sino-Burmese Friendship Will Be Developed and Consolidated."
    The Rangoon-based Chinese newspaper "People's Daily" published the full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the state banquet hosted by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, with the banner headline "Asian-African Peoples Stand Up More Firmly," "Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship Creates New Model for Asian Countries," "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are Active and Full of Vitality."

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 17th: On the eve of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, Indian public opinion is eagerly looking forward to the upcoming meeting between the Chinese and Indian premiers and emphasizing the great significance of this meeting for maintaining Sino-Indian friendship and strengthening Asian and world peace.
    The Indian Communist Party's "New Age" weekly published an editorial in its latest issue stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to New Delhi and his talks with Prime Minister Nehru are of great significance, not only as a step towards resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute, but also for the future of Indo-Chinese friendship, Asian solidarity, and world peace.
    The editorial said that Zhou Enlai is coming to India as "our honored guest"—a friend on a mission of peace. The editorial condemned the conspiracies of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, the Swatantra Party, and other reactionary elements to oppose the visit, undermine Sino-Indian talks, and demand that India abandon its non-alignment policy. The editorial pointed out that they are shameless defenders of imperialism. "Their activities will only benefit those who oppose freedom and peace."
    According to "Liberty," a resolution was passed at a public gathering held under the auspices of the Peace Council of Nadia District, West Bengal, expressing the hope that the upcoming Sino-Indian premier meeting will resolve the border issue through friendly talks. The resolution reminded the people to be wary of the sabotage activities of Indian reactionary parties.
    "Liberty" also condemned the attempts by Indian right-wing parties to deliberately poison the atmosphere and create disappointment before the upcoming Sino-Indian premier meeting. The newspaper said: Despite attempts by some in India to create an atmosphere of disappointment, a large section of the Indian people remain convinced that the ice will melt.
    According to a report in the April 15th "Indian Express" from Meerut, Dipankar, leader of the Indian United Socialist Organization, said on the 14th that the only way to resolve the border dispute with China is through negotiations. He condemned those who were plotting to sabotage the negotiations by holding anti-China demonstrations, saying that the Chinese premier was a guest invited by the Indian prime minister and that any discourtesy towards him would violate Indian culture and tradition.
    Some Indian newspapers also commented on Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China. The April 12th "Today" said that the speech "is timely" and can create a favorable atmosphere in strained political relations. It said that the Indian people have been concerned with the talks between the two premiers and their possible outcomes with extreme urgency.
    The newspaper believes that there is no reason to be disappointed. It said, "Nothing should happen now to turn a favorable, hopeful political atmosphere into disappointment or pain." The "Glory" also published an editorial on the 12th saying that it "welcomes the Chinese premier's announcement that China does not want to make trouble with anyone." But it added that Premier Zhou's speech "should not bring more hope than is necessary."
    The Chinese Foreign Ministry's note to the Indian Embassy in China on April 3rd attracted attention in New Delhi. A commentary published by "India News Agency" on the 11th said, "People here believe that the polite tone of the note indicates the friendly atmosphere that Zhou Enlai hopes to maintain throughout his week-long visit to Delhi." The commentary said, "The Chinese government has taken an optimistic view in estimating the current mood, and people here think this is very meaningful." It added that politicians in New Delhi attach great importance to words such as "mutual understanding and mutual accommodation," believing that these are conditions that may pave the way to a solution.
    According to a commentary in the April 12th "Indian Express," some observers in India are very interested to note that the Chinese note refers to "mutual concessions," "sincerity on both sides," and that lasting Sino-Indian friendship is much more important than the border dispute, which the note describes as "a local and temporary issue." However, the commentary repeated the fallacy that China "invaded Ladakh."
    Some right-wing newspapers in India used the Chinese note to carry out anti-China propaganda. They repeated India's rigid past stance on the Sino-Indian border issue and spread pessimistic views about the Sino-Indian talks. The "Tribune" acknowledged that the note was friendly and sincere in tone, but tried its best to promote the idea that there was no optimistic atmosphere in India before the talks. "New Age India" insisted that "the Sino-Indian border has been fully demarcated." Mankekar, editor of the "Indian Express," published a commentary on April 12th, vigorously promoting the idea that the talks between the Chinese and Indian premiers would "fail." He believed that as long as the talks fail, India can consider forming an anti-communist alliance with some Southeast Asian countries in military and economic terms.

    缅甸舆论热烈欢呼中缅友好
    坚持万隆原则就能和平共处
    印度舆论殷切瞩望中印总理的会晤
    新华社仰光17日电　仰光的所有缅文大报今天都发表社论和文章，热烈欢迎周恩来总理访问缅甸，并热烈欢呼中缅友谊。
    “罕礁越利报”指出：“仰光今年的泼水节的巨大意义在于有中华人民共和国的周恩来总理和他的随行人员参加。”
    文章接着说：“遵循和平共处五项原则的中缅关系一直是顺利的。而且，不仅能够成功地缔结关于边界问题的协议，还能够缔结两国之间的互不侵犯条约。缅甸不能忘记，这所以成为可能，是由于周恩来总理和中华人民共和国的其它领袖表现了宽宏大度的精神和同缅甸友好的愿望。”
    “联邦报”在社论中指出：“从我们的邻国来的客人们这样友好而亲切地参加泼水节，这预示两国之间的友情将在日后得到进一步的加强”。
    “镜报”说，中缅两国成功地缔结了边界协定和互不侵犯条约，“这是亚洲国家的友谊和团结的里程碑。这是维护万隆原则的成就。而且，这也有助于亚洲和世界和平。”
    这家报纸又说：“正当现在正在庆祝两国之间的友谊的成就的时候，中华人民共和国总理周恩来前来缅甸访问，这是一个极好的吉兆。”
    这家报纸表示希望，中印边界问题将能顺利地解决。
    “缅甸时报”以“新年的黎明”为题发表社论说：“邻国之间的这种友好亲善的关系能够带来和平和繁荣，因此，还应当进行努力来进一步改善和加强这种友好亲善的关系。”
    这篇社论着重指出：万隆会议规定了几项原则，这些原则，使得各国尽管有着不同的意识形态，能够和平友好地共处。“只要坚持万隆原则，各国就能够在和平和友好中共处。”
    这家报纸说：“由于缅甸和中国是两个遵循万隆原则的国家，因此它们不但能够顺利地解决边界问题，而且还能够缔结一项友好和互不侵犯条约。”
    据新华社仰光17日电　仰光的英文和缅甸文报纸继续以显著地位刊载周恩来总理在这里的活动的消息和照片。英文“卫报”今天在头版刊载了周总理参加泼水节的消息，标题是：“周（恩来）和（吴）努参加仰光泼水节”，“正在这里访问的‘胞波’在缅甸首都欢乐地泼水”。同这个消息一起发表的是一张占三栏地位的照片，上面是周恩来总理在到达仰光时接受一位缅甸姑娘向他献花的情况。在头版刊载的另外两张照片是周总理穿着缅甸服装参加泼水节的情况。
    英文“民族报”也在头版以显著地位刊载了周恩来总理到达仰光和到达后的活动的消息。标题是“中国总理到达，欢度泼水节”，“泛舟河上，出席正式宴会”。
  缅甸文“仰光日报”在头版以差不多整版的篇幅刊载了国宴的消息和周恩来总理昨天拜会缅甸总统吴温貌的消息。
    “镜报”刊载了周恩来总理和缅甸总理吴努愉快地参加泼水节庆祝活动的两张照片。
    “吞报”在头版刊载了周恩来总理到达的消息，它的通栏大标题是“周恩来总理到达仰光”。
    “联邦报”刊载了周恩来总理和吴努总理在仰光机场发表的讲话的全文，标题是“团结和世界和平”，副题是“中缅友谊将得到发展和巩固。”
    仰光华侨报纸“人民报”刊载了周恩来总理在缅甸总理吴努所设国宴上发表的讲话全文，通栏标题是“亚非人民更坚强地站了起来”，“中缅友好条约为亚洲各国创造了新的范例”，“和平共处五项原则是积极的和有丰富的生命力的”。
    新华社新德里17日电　在周恩来总理访问印度前夕，印度舆论殷切瞩望中印两国总理即将举行的会晤，并且强调这次会晤对于维护中印友谊，加强亚洲和世界和平的重大意义。
    印度共产党的“新世纪”周报在最近一期上发表社论说，周恩来总理即将对新德里的访问以及他同尼赫鲁总理的会谈，不但作为一个解决中印边界纠纷的步骤具有非常重大的意义，而且对于印中友好的前途、亚洲团结和世界和平也有非常重大的意义。
    社论说，周恩来是作为“我们的尊敬的客人”——负有和平使命的朋友——来到印度的。社论谴责印度人民社会党、自由党和其他一些反动分子反对这次访问，破坏中印会谈，要求印度放弃不结盟政策等阴谋。社论指出，他们是帝国主义的无耻的辩护者。“他们的活动只会使得反对自由和和平的人得到好处”。
    据“自由报”报道，在西孟加拉邦纳的阿德县和平理事会主持下举行的一次公众集会上通过一项决议，希望在即将举行的中印总理会晤中能通过友好会谈解决边界问题。决议提醒人民提防印度反动政党的破坏活动。
    “自由报”还谴责印度右翼政党在即将举行的中印总理会晤以前蓄意毒化气氛，制造失望情绪的企图。这家报纸说：尽管印度有人要制造失望情绪，印度很大一部分人仍然确信冰块会融解。
    据15日的“印度快报”自密拉特报道，印度统一社会主义组织领袖迪潘卡14日说，解决同中国的边界争端的唯一途径是通过谈判。他谴责那些阴谋破坏谈判举行反华示威的人，他说，中国总理是印度总理邀请的客人，对他的任何不礼貌都将违反印度的文化和传统。
    印度一些报纸还就周恩来总理在中国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的讲话发表评论。12日的“今天报”说，这个讲话“是及时的”，可以在紧张的政治关系中创造有利的气氛。它说，印度人民一直怀着极其迫切的心情关心着两国总理的会谈及其可能产生的结果。
    报纸认为，没有理由感到失望。他说，“现在不应该发生任何事情来使有利的、有希望的政治气氛变成失望或者痛苦。”“荣耀报”12日也发表社论说，它“欢迎中国总理宣布中国不想同任何人制造麻烦”。但是它又说，周总理的讲话“带来的希望不应该比必要的希望更多”。
    中国外交部4月3日给印度驻华大使馆的照会，引起了新德里的注意。“印度新闻社”11日发表的评论中说，“这里的人们认为这个照会有礼貌的语调表明了周恩来在德里整个一周访问期间所希望保持的友好气氛”。评论说，“中国政府在估计目前的情绪时采取了乐观的观点，这里的人们认为这是很有意义的。”它又说，新德里的政界先生们很重视“互谅互让”等字眼，认为这是可能铺平通往解决的道路的条件。
    据12日的“印度快报”的一篇述评说，印度一些观察家很有兴趣地注意到，中国照会谈到“互让”，“彼此表现出诚意”，并且谈到持久的中印友谊要比边界纠纷重要得多，而照会说边界纠纷是“局部性的和暂时性的问题”。但是评论却重复所谓中国“侵略了拉达克”的谬论。
    印度的一些右派报纸则就中国照会进行反华宣传，它们重复过去印度在中印边界问题的僵硬立场，并且对中印会谈散布悲观论调。“论坛报”承认照会语气友好诚挚，但又竭力宣传在会谈前夕印度国内并没有乐观气氛。“印度新时代报”硬说，“中印边界是充分划定了的”。“印度快报”主编曼基卡尔12日发表评论大肆宣传中印两国总理会谈要“失败”，他认为只要会谈一失败，印度就可以考虑在军事上和经济上同东南亚一些国家结成反共同盟了。
