Newsreel Films Leap to a Higher Level
    Shen Rong
    Since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our newsreel films have entered a brand-new stage. In a short two years, film studios have been universally established in all provinces throughout the country, and the footsteps of newsreel cinematographers have almost covered the entire country. In 1958 and 1959, the country produced 2,236 reels of newsreels, equivalent to the total output of the past eight years. Among the films produced in 1959, the output of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region film studios accounted for 70%. Many excellent films have been welcomed by a broad audience both at home and abroad.
  "Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line," Parts 1 and 2, according to incomplete statistics, had an audience of over 80 million; "Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion" had over 60 million; "Man Will Conquer Nature" had over 30 million; "Shanghai Heroic Symphony," despite being shown in Shanghai for only a short period, had over 700,000 viewers. The export of documentaries has also been increasing year by year. In 1958, 155 films were exported, including 16 feature-length documentaries and 139 short documentaries. A large number of newsreels have promptly reflected the earth-shaking changes in our country, reported on the rapid development of our country, promoted new people and new deeds, and inspired the fighting spirit and drive of the broad masses of the people. Newsreel films, this important film genre, this indispensable and powerful weapon in the Party's propaganda work, is playing an increasingly important role in our country's socialist revolution and construction, and is becoming more and more welcomed by the broad masses. The people have given this work a high evaluation, calling newsreel films "living newspapers" and newsreel cinemas "political classrooms" and "amateur universities," which is the greatest glory for our newsreel filmmakers.
    The reason why newsreel films have achieved such tremendous results is the result of the Party's emphasis and continuous strengthening of political and ideological leadership. Our Party has always valued this work. The earliest film institution we established—the "Film Troupe" in Yan'an—primarily shot newsreels. Now, the Party committees of various provinces and cities frequently determine themes and study content for newsreel films, and some secretaries personally revise the narration of the films. The Party's leadership is the most reliable guarantee for the success of newsreel films. Whether newsreel films can promptly and correctly reflect the people's lives and national construction, and completely and excellently accomplish our glorious tasks, depends most importantly on whether we closely rely on the Party's leadership.
    The reason why newsreel films have achieved such great results is also due to the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Although the history of our country's newsreel films is short, it has been closely linked to the current struggles from the beginning, with a clear tendency and purpose of serving proletarian politics. This is the most fundamental reason why newsreel films are so popular with the masses. Currently, the people of the whole country are working hard to build a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Undoubtedly, newsreel films must serve this lofty purpose.
    Newsreel films are "illustrated political essays, and their spirit should conform to the line followed by our excellent Soviet newspapers." Lenin's instruction has been confirmed by the very rich experience of our newsreel film work. This requires our newsreel films to have a high degree of ideological and political character, as well as strict authenticity and the most perfect form possible, just like Party newspapers. Many of our good documentaries have these characteristics. We have criticized various erroneous ideas. We have consistently adhered to the authenticity of newsreel films. Newsreel films are different from feature films, and different from novels and dramas. It cannot create typical characters through the author's imagination, fiction, and exaggeration, like other arts, but should only select typical characters and report on them from the real people, real events, and ongoing events that actually exist in life, just like newspapers. It does not allow for fiction, exaggeration, or acting. Its main means should be interviewing and photography. Only as a last resort should there be post-event reshoots and so-called "organized shooting," nor is it possible to meticulously describe the psychological state of characters like feature films.
    In the past, some comrades advocated that filmmakers could make certain suggestions to the units being filmed, such as organizing production competitions, holding get-togethers, etc., and then filming them, and believed that this was a way to promote work. This view is obviously wrong. Because it is the local Party committee, not the external filmmakers, that leads the people forward. Newsreel filmmakers should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, immerse themselves in life, actively participate in the struggles of the masses, interview materials, study materials, and then shoot according to the requirements of publicity and reporting.
    This principle of authenticity of newsreel films is determined by the characteristics of this genre. Only by strictly abiding by this principle can newsreel films correctly reflect the people's lives and struggles and gain the trust of the masses. Only on the basis of authenticity can we talk about the political and ideological nature of the film. If newsreel films are not authentic, it will affect the political prestige of the film, and thus will inevitably affect the prestige of the Party's propaganda work. Therefore, only by demanding newsreel films with the spirit of running a Party newspaper is the only correct path. Our newsreel films have a high prestige among the masses, and the people call it a "living newspaper," which is by no means accidental. Some people have unilaterally emphasized the artistry of the film, ignoring the importance of authenticity, and ignoring the political impact of the film. They believe that emphasizing the authenticity of the film will bind the author's creation and affect the artistry of the film. They emphasize the artistic effects of "reshoots," "organized shooting," and "acting." In this way, they have opposed authenticity and artistry, without understanding that the artistry of newsreel films must be based on authenticity and on a high degree of ideology.
    Of course, while adhering to the authenticity of newsreel films, we should also continue to strive to improve the artistry of newsreel films. The artistry of newsreel films is mainly manifested in: the content of the film strives to be accurate, clear, and vivid; the structure is compact, the logic is rigorous, and it is convincing; the picture is clear and can highlight the theme idea. The narration of the film should strive to be smooth, concise, vivid, and easy to understand, avoiding foreign clichés and student tones. The music of the film should be combined with the picture and have national style and local color. Our films should make the greatest efforts to be popularized and nationalized, so that farmers can understand and like to watch them. This is essentially a question of considering the 500 million peasants, and also a question of the mass viewpoint of filmmakers.
    The new stage of socialist construction has put forward new tasks for newsreel films. In order for newsreel films to leap to a higher level, newsreel filmmakers need to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, strengthen ideological transformation, adhere to going deep into life and participating in labor training, strive to improve their professional skills, and shoot more and better newsreels that reflect our heroic era and heroic figures and are loved by the people!

    新闻纪录电影向更高的水平跃进
    沈容
    大跃进以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们的新闻纪录电影进入了一个崭新的阶段。在短短两年内，全国各省普遍建立了电影制片厂，新闻纪录电影摄影师的足迹几乎遍及全国。1958年和1959年全国生产了新闻纪录片二千二百三十六本，相当于过去八年产量的总和。1959年生产的影片中，省、市、自治区制片厂的出品占了70％。很多优秀影片在国内外都受到广大观众的欢迎。
  “在总路线的光辉照耀下”一、二集据不完全统计，观众有八千多万人次，“平息西藏叛乱”有六千多万人次；“人定胜天”有三千多万人次；“上海英雄交响曲”在上海上映的日子不多，就有七十多万观众。向国外输出的纪录片也在逐年增加。1958年就输出一百五十五部，其中有十六部长纪录片、一百三十九部短纪录片。大量新闻纪录片及时地反映了我国翻天复地的变化，报道了我国一日千里的发展，宣传了新人新事，鼓舞了广大人民的斗志和干劲。新闻纪录电影这一重要的片种，党的宣传工作中这个不可缺少的有力武器，在我国社会主义革命和建设事业中，正愈来愈起着重要的作用，愈来愈受到广大群众的欢迎。人民群众给了这个工作以很高的评价，他们把新闻纪录电影叫做“活报纸”，把新闻电影院叫做“政治课堂”和“业余大学”，这是我们的新闻纪录电影工作者最大的光荣。
    新闻纪录电影之所以能取得这样巨大的成绩，是党的重视和不断加强政治思想领导的结果。我们党从来就是重视这个工作的，我们最早建立的电影机构——延安的“电影团”，首先拍摄的就是新闻纪录片。现在各省市的党委，经常为新闻纪录电影确定主题，研究内容，有的书记亲自修改电影的解说词。党的领导是新闻纪录电影获得成绩的最可靠的保证。新闻纪录电影能不能及时地、正确地反映人民生活和国家建设，完满地和出色地完成我们光荣的任务，最重要的决定于我们是不是紧紧依靠党的领导。
    新闻纪录电影之所以取得这样大的成绩，还由于坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方针。我国的新闻纪录电影历史虽短，但是一开始就紧紧结合当前的斗争，具有鲜明的为无产阶级政治服务的倾向性和目的性。这是新闻纪录电影所以深受群众欢迎的最根本的原因。目前，全国人民正在鼓足干劲，为建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。无疑地，新闻纪录电影必须为这一崇高的目的服务。
    新闻纪录电影是“形象化的政论，而其精神应该符合于我们优秀苏维埃报纸所遵循的路线”。列宁的这个指示，已经为我们新闻纪录电影工作非常丰富的经验所证实。这就要求我们的新闻纪录电影应该像党报那样，既要有高度的思想性和政策性，又要有严格的真实性和尽可能完美的形式。我们的许多好的纪录片就具有这些特色。我们曾经批判了各种错误的思想。我们一贯不渝地坚持了新闻纪录电影的真实性。新闻纪录电影和故事片不同，和小说、戏剧不同，它不能像其他艺术那样通过作者的想像、虚构和夸张的手法来创造典型，而只应该像报纸那样从生活中实际存在的真人真事和正在发生的事象中来选择典型，进行报道。它不允许虚构、浮夸和扮演。它的主要的手段应该是采访摄影，不是万不得已，不应该进行事后的补拍和所谓的“组织拍摄”，也不可能像故事片那样细致地描写人物的心理状态。
    过去曾经有个别同志主张电影工作者可以向被拍摄的单位提出某些建议，如组织生产竞赛，举行联欢等等，然后拍成电影，并且认为这是推动工作的一种方法。这种主张显然是错误的。因为领导人民群众前进的是当地的党委，而不是外面去的电影工作者，新闻纪录电影工作者应该在当地党委领导下，深入生活，积极参加群众的斗争，根据宣传报道要求，采访材料，研究材料，然后进行拍摄。
    新闻纪录电影这种真实性的原则，是由这个片种的特性决定的。只有严格遵守这个原则，新闻纪录片才能正确地反映人民的生活和斗争，得到群众的信任。只有在真实性的基础上，才谈得上影片的政治性和思想性。如果新闻纪录片不真实，就会影响影片的政治威信，从而也必将影响党的宣传工作的威信。所以只有以办党报的精神来要求新闻纪录电影，才是唯一正确的道路。我们的新闻纪录电影在群众中有很高的威信，人民群众把它叫做“活报纸”，这绝不是偶然的。有些人曾经片面地强调影片的艺术性，忽视了真实性的重要意义，忽视了影片在政治上的影响。他们认为强调影片的真实性就会束缚作者的创作，影响影片的艺术性，他们强调“补拍”、“组织拍摄”、“扮演”的艺术效果好。这样他们就把真实性和艺术性对立起来了，而不了解新闻纪录片的艺术性必须建立在真实性的基础上，建立在高度的思想性的基础上。
    当然，我们在坚持新闻纪录电影的真实性的同时，还应该不断地努力提高新闻纪录电影的艺术性。新闻纪录电影的艺术性，主要表现在：影片的内容力求准确、鲜明、生动；结构紧凑，逻辑严密，具有说服力；画面清晰，能突出主题思想。影片的解说词应该力求顺畅、精练、生动、通俗易懂，避免洋八股和学生腔。影片的音乐应与画面结合，具有民族风格和地方色彩。我们的影片应该尽最大的努力做到群众化和民族化，使农民看得懂，喜欢看。这实质上是为五亿农民着想的问题，也是电影工作者的群众观点问题。
    社会主义建设的新阶段，向新闻纪录影片提出了新的任务。为了新闻纪录电影向更高的水平跃进，新闻纪录电影工作者需要加强马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作的学习，加强思想改造，坚持深入生活和劳动锻炼，努力提高业务能力，拍摄出更多更好的反映我们的英雄时代和英雄人物的、为人民群众喜闻乐见的新闻纪录片来！
