    Rapid Development of Agricultural Cooperativization in the German Democratic Republic
    West German Farmers Yearn For It

    (Reported by this newspaper) The large-scale and rapid development of agricultural cooperativization in the German Democratic Republic, and the benefits it brings to farmers, have caused a great reaction among West German farmers. According to a report by the German News Agency, some farmers from Stuttgart, West Germany, recently visited the German Democratic Republic. After the visit, one farmer said with deep emotion: "Whoever personally sees the development of the German Democratic Republic knows that the farmers of the German Democratic Republic enjoy a share in the overall improvement of economic conditions. In West Germany, small farmers are 'ruthlessly' devoured to make the large farm owners even larger."
    It is no accident that West German farmers draw such conclusions from comparing the agricultural conditions of the two Germanys. Due to the West German government's policy of pursuing arms expansion and war preparations, and serving the interests of monopoly capital and large farm owners, West German small and medium farmers face difficult livelihoods, and more and more of their businesses are going bankrupt. According to a report by the German News Agency, at the beginning of this year, nearly 1,500 small and medium farmers in the forest region of Bavaria, West Germany, applied to sell their properties. "Westphalia and Lippe Agricultural Weekly" published twenty-four advertisements in its latest issue for farmers selling or auctioning agricultural properties. But these are only recent sporadic figures. The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" admitted in a commentary last year that "concentration in agriculture is obviously accelerating." In ten years, 180,000 small farmers with land holdings of less than five hectares have gone bankrupt. According to a report in the "Neues Deutschland," because the "Common Market" established by West Germany and five other countries will make provisions on the prices and taxes of agricultural products that favor large enterprises, 400,000 medium and small farmers in West Germany are expected to go bankrupt.
    But the disaster for West German farmers does not stop there. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and West Germany's "Bundeswehr" have consistently occupied and confiscated large amounts of land for use as military bases, airfields, and training grounds. In the past decade, in addition to the land that had already been confiscated during the Nazi period, the West German authorities have plundered more than 100,000 hectares of land from farmers. In March of this year, Lieutenant General Löttig, a former Nazi general and current West German Army prosecutor, announced that, due to the need for "pre-war training" in preparation for "total war," another 90,000 hectares of land would continue to be requisitioned. In order to defend their land, West German farmers have taken action. Farmers in the village of Bruchhausen, Westphalia, recently decided to hold a combat demonstration, in which they will pile up a large number of vehicles as obstacles on the training grounds of the Belgian troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to force them to withdraw.
    In order to understand the new life of farmers in the German Democratic Republic, farmers from Oberrossbach, Bavaria, West Germany, invited a delegation of farmers from the German Democratic Republic to be their guests on April 3. Despite the West German police's best efforts to obstruct them, hundreds of West German farmers met with their compatriots. When they learned about the flourishing agriculture and the very happy lives of farmers in the German Democratic Republic, they could not help but express their indignation at the Bonn government's slander of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the German Democratic Republic.

### 德意志民主共和国农业合作化飞速发展  西德农民心向往之

    德意志民主共和国农业合作化飞速发展
    西德农民心向往之
    本报讯　德意志民主共和国农业合作化的大规模的迅速发展，和农业合作化给农民带来的好处，已经在西德农民中引起了很大的反应。据德意志通讯社报道，西德斯图加特的一些农民最近曾到德意志民主共和国进行了参观。一个农民在参观后感慨万端地说：“谁亲自看到了民主德国的发展，谁就知道，民主德国的农民在经济状况总的改善中享有一份。而在西德，小农却被‘冷酷地’吃掉，来使大农场主变得更大”。
    西德农民在两个德国的农业状况对比中得出这样的结论，并不是偶然的。由于西德政府执行扩军备战和为垄断资本与大农场主服务的政策，西德中小农民生计艰难，家业破产的越来越多。据德意志通讯社报道，今年年初西德巴伐利亚州森林地区有将近一千五百户中小农申请出售他们的产业。“威斯特伐利亚和利卑农业周报”在最近一期上刊登了二十四幅农民出售或拍卖农业产业的广告。但这只不过是最近的零星数字。西德“法兰克福汇报”在去年的一篇评论中承认，西德“农业方面的集中显然越来越快”。十年之间，已经有十八万户只拥有五公顷以下土地的小农户遭到破产。另据“新德意志报”报道，由于西德和其他五国建立的“共同市场”将就农产品的价格和税收作出有利于大企业主的规定，西德的四十万中、小农户预料也将遭到破产。
    但是西德农民的灾难还不止此。北大西洋集团和西德的“国防军”一直占用、没收大量的土地作为军事基地、机场和演习场。十年来，除了在纳粹时期已经被没收的土地外，西德当局又向农民掠夺了十多万公顷的土地。今年3月，前纳粹将领、现任西德陆军检察官的勒提格尔中将又宣布，由于准备“总体战”的“战前训练”的需要，将继续征用九万公顷土地。为了保卫自己的土地，西德的农民已经行动起来。威斯特伐利亚州布鲁赫豪森村的农民最近决定要举行一次战斗示威，他们将把大量的车辆堆集在北大西洋集团军比利时部队的演习场上作为障碍，以迫使他们退出去。
    为了了解德意志民主共和国农民的新生活，西德巴伐利亚州上罗斯巴赫的农民在4月3日邀请一个德意志民主共和国农民代表团去作客。尽管西德警察竭力加以阻挠，但是西德数百名农民还是会见了自己的同胞兄弟。当他们了解了德意志民主共和国农业欣欣向荣、农民生活十分幸福的情况以后，他们不禁对波恩政府诽谤德意志民主共和国农业合作化运动的勾当表示愤慨。
