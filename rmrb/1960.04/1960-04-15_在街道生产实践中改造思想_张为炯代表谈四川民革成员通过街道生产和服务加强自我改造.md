Comrade Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

    I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

    Now, I will make the following speech on the issue of Sichuan Min革 members strengthening their self-reform through street production and service. Any inappropriate points, please correct me!

    Since 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the people of the whole country have achieved an unprecedented continuous Great Leap Forward in the national economy. In this resounding chorus of triumph, workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country have been encouraged to work hard and strive for the top. Triumphant reports from the industrial and agricultural production fronts have poured in from all directions, and the land of the motherland has become a magnificent picture of ten thousand horses galloping forward. Scattered upper and middle-class figures from the former Kuomintang military and political circles, under the impetus of this situation, have also expressed their willingness to serve socialist construction and strive to reform themselves. The new situation has presented us with new tasks. Under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, our Sichuan Min革, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and in accordance with the principle proposed by the Party of "taking political thought as the commander, labor practice as the foundation, and the work post as the base," has actively promoted members formerly belonging to the upper and middle levels of the Kuomintang military and political circles, especially those scattered in society, and the social figures they are connected with, to face the streets, face production, and face the masses, to serve street industries and public welfare undertakings, and to strengthen self-reform through the practice of service, that is, to change their subjective world by participating in the transformation of the objective world.

      To Reform Well, Listening to the Party is the First Thing

    Through more than a year of service practice and self-reform, the political thought of the majority of our members has made great progress on the original basis, and has also played a certain positive role in street production and service undertakings. Of course, the development of things is not a straight upward line, but a process of repeated and tortuous struggle. Many of our members have experienced wavering and repetition on the road forward, and have reflected varying degrees of doubt, dissatisfaction, and resistance to many new things that have emerged in the Great Leap Forward. But despite this, under the correct leadership and earnest education of the Party, and encouraged by the situation and helped by the masses, after practice, the general trend is still forward. For example, some people were originally distant from the Party and unwilling to meet with Party comrades often, and were unwilling to tell the truth when they did meet. Now they have been able to gradually get closer to the Party, and they talk to the Party committee whenever they have a problem. The Party committee points out the direction and resolves doubts, and many problems that could not be solved have been solved with the support of the Party committee. One fact after another tells them that the Party is selfless and welcomes everyone who is willing to make progress. More and more members have realized this fundamental issue: "To reform well and serve well, listening to the Party is the first thing." Some members originally had doubts about the Party's policies. For example, when they saw that the supply of vegetables in the city was insufficient for a time, they thought that vegetable production had decreased, and therefore doubted whether the policy of taking grain as the key link had caused agricultural production to lose its balance. Later, they participated in the Spring Festival service, helping commercial departments transport vegetables from the suburbs into the city, and along the way they saw the scene of the all-round Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Not only vegetable production, but also various other agricultural products were universally abundant, only because transportation could not keep up for a while, did the phenomenon of occasional imbalance in vegetable supply occur. At this time, they began to clarify that the Party's policy of taking grain as the key link in agriculture, like the policy of taking steel as the key link in industry, was also leading the way. Some members said: "It is not that there is a problem with the Party's policies, but that there is a problem with our ideology and viewpoint. 'A leaf blinds the eye, and one cannot see Mount Tai'." Some members originally had a vague understanding of the Great Leap Forward, saying something like "If we leap again, people will be leaped to exhaustion." Later, in their service practice, they saw that the worker and peasant brothers were both wise and courageous on the production front, combined work and rest, and therefore their enthusiasm became greater and greater, their work efficiency became higher and higher, and their labor morale became more and more full. The facts were the opposite of what they had originally imagined. At this time, they began to realize that the Party had correctly combined the objective laws of things with people's subjective initiative, and had created the greatest possibility for a sustained Great Leap Forward; at the same time, they also understood that in the Great Leap Forward, the worker and peasant masses were advancing triumphantly, while they were pointing fingers from behind, which was a different reflection of the socialist and capitalist worldviews. These members have lived in the old military and political circles for a long time, always despised labor, and looked down on the working masses. Through service practice, some members have personally experienced the value of labor and the shamefulness of exploitation, the greatness of the working people and their own insignificance. Some said: "I used to not know the difficulty of farming. When I read Li Shen's poem 'Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat dripping onto the soil, who knows that on the plate is food, every grain is hard-earned,' I only appreciated it as a beautiful literary work. Today, when I read it, I feel particularly close to it." Some also said: "Without the back pain in labor, one cannot realize a thorough transformation in thought."

      If the Direction is Unclear, Find the Party Committee; If You Don't Understand Technology, Ask a Teacher; If There is No Solution, Ask the Masses

    With the gradual improvement of these members' political and ideological understanding, their performance in service practice has gradually improved. First of all, it is reflected in the labor attitude: when they first participated in service practice, they could not put down their airs, and some people thought it was "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut." Later, the Party put forward the policy of sending cadres to lower levels for labor training. Thousands of cadres from agencies went to the countryside and the mountains. Many leading comrades of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee also took the lead in participating in physical labor. In particular, our great people's leader Chairman Mao and many leaders of the Party and the state also dug earth, carried mud, and lifted stones together with the working people in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir project, which moved everyone. Under the education of this great reality, most of those who were unwilling to "get on the horse of practice" got on the horse, and those who got off the horse halfway remounted; those who could not put down their airs, later went to the suburbs to transport vegetables, to parks and "flower shows" to receive tourists, and to the streets to engage in industrial production and social services. Some people gradually changed from reluctant to natural, from uneasy to at ease. Some of them performed more actively. For example, some insisted on working all day to do a good job in the Spring Festival service, and were unwilling to go home even when their sons got married; some actively participated in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and made some creations and inventions; a female social member in Chongqing, who came from the Qing Dynasty imperial family, and had always lived a pampered life, has now become a versatile street worker; in Chengdu, five members, with the support of the Party committee, started a bamboo art production team from scratch, manufacturing bamboo water pipes that are loved by the broad masses of the people in Sichuan. It has now been expanded into a private factory with eighty or ninety people. Last year, they bid farewell to the old year with "full house red", and this year they welcomed the new year with "opening red"; some old and weak comrades who could not go out to participate in activities, compiled historical materials, painted, and wrote poems at home, praising the Party, praising Chairman Mao, and praising socialism. As they themselves said: "The spring is infinitely good, and old trees sprout new branches." Secondly, it is reflected in the attitude towards the working people: some members in the Spring Festival and "flower show" service work, received workers and peasants with special enthusiasm, saying that they wanted to let the worker and peasant brothers spend the holidays happily, so that they could greet new battles on the production front. The worker and peasant brothers praised these comrades as "better than Huang Zhong"; some members who participated in street industrial production labor were also able to humbly learn technology from the old workers, learning whatever they were doing, learning bamboo art for those who were doing bamboo art, learning carpentry for those who were doing carpentry, and learning chemical engineering for those who were doing chemical engineering; and gradually realized the greatness of the Party's mass line, and asked the masses for advice on everything, thereby gaining a lot of help from the masses in terms of ideology and work. Under the education of many vivid facts, some members have gradually clarified these three points in their minds: "If the direction is unclear, find the Party committee; if you don't understand technology, ask a teacher; if there is no solution, ask the masses." What deserves special attention here is that because they participated in service practice and contributed their own labor, some members have developed a certain feeling for socialist construction. For example, a comrade who managed flowers and trees at the "flower show" felt lost if he did not go there to see them every other day; a comrade who engaged in bamboo art production stared intently at the bamboo cigarette holders he produced when he saw them displayed on the market, and was reluctant to leave. Because they participated in service practice and received some training in collective life, some members' collective concept has been strengthened. For example, some voluntarily repaired honeycomb coal stoves for nearby residents, saving coal and labor for the country; a female comrade actively collected feces and sent them to the hospital to prevent acute infectious diseases, and carried stretchers for patients; because they participated in service practice and had more serious contact with the working people, some members have shortened the distance from the working people in their minds. For example, some members have made friends with peasant brothers, and they visit each other during holidays; a social member in Chengdu who is nearly seventy years old goes to the suburbs forty miles away twice a month to voluntarily treat peasant brothers, and has persisted for more than a year without interruption. And these positive performances have been praised by the working masses, who have changed their views on our members and shortened the distance, that is to say, this part of our members has begun to improve relations with the working people. All of the above shows that through service practice, the majority of our Min革 members have taken a big step forward on the road from exploiters to laborers, and have also played a certain positive role in the socialist construction of the motherland, which is conducive to the establishment of urban people's communes.

        To Change the Bourgeois Standpoint and Worldview, One Must Persist in Unremitting Efforts

    But at the same time, we must also see that to transform from exploiters to laborers, from the capitalist quagmire to the socialist paradise, one must go through a long, complex, and tortuous process of struggle. Despite the compelling situation, some people still hesitate on the wrong path and are slow to "get on the horse of practice"; some people, although they have participated in practice, still swing from side to side, rising and falling; some have learned technology, but still hope to be "freelancers" in the future; and some regard service practice as a "stepping stone" to obtain political arrangements. And these comrades have one thing in common, that is, old knots are untied, and new contradictions arise again. This shows that although the change of the bourgeois standpoint and worldview is possible, it is not easy, and one must continue to persist in unremitting efforts.

    From this vivid fact, I deeply realized the greatness and correctness of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. It is precisely because of the illumination of the General Line and the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward that all positive factors can be mobilized, so that advanced elements become more advanced, and backward people cannot but advance with the socialist tide; it is precisely because of the widespread organization of the economic life of urban residents and the development of the urban people's commune movement that a broad world has been opened up for the people of all strata in the city to serve the motherland and transform themselves. These three magic weapons were formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao by concentrating the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and in the final analysis, it is the greatness and correctness of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    From this vivid fact, we have also clearly realized that under the leadership of the Party, taking political and ideological education as the commander, promoting upper and middle-level members of democratic parties to participate in urban street industrial production and public welfare undertakings, and strengthening self-reform through service practice, is a correct and effective way for our democratic parties to accelerate the realization of self-reform.

    The Party teaches us: "The new and tremendous development of urban people's communes is an event of great historical significance," "Its growth will be a new and major positive factor for achieving the continued leap forward in 1960 and beyond." Vice Premier Li Fuchun further proved in his report with concrete facts that urban people's communes, like rural people's communes, have great vitality, and instructed us on the specific path of how to work hard in the future. Our Sichuan Min革 has decided to follow the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao in the future, hold high the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and further promote members of the Min革 and the masses they are connected with, as well as the families of these members and the masses, in various cities throughout the province to invest in the great urban people's commune movement, and to play a more active role in street industrial production, public welfare undertakings, and service undertakings, and to accelerate the process of self-reform in service practice. We firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the brilliant illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, our country's socialist construction will always be victorious, and our glorious task of Sichuan Min革 serving the motherland and reforming ourselves will definitely be able to achieve new and greater victories in the future.

专栏：

    在街道生产实践中改造思想
    张为炯代表谈四川民革成员通过街道生产和服务加强自我改造主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，并完全同意全国人大常委会的工作报告。
    现在，我就四川民革成员通过街道生产和服务，从实践中加强自我改造的问题作如下的发言。不妥之处，请予指正！
    1958年以来，全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，实现了史无前例的国民经济连续大跃进。在这一曲响彻云霄的凯歌声中，全国工人、农民和革命知识分子，人人鼓干劲，个个争上游，工农业生产战线上的捷报从四方八面传来，祖国的大地变成了一幅壮丽的万马奔腾的跃进图。散处在各方面的原国民党军政界的中上层人士，在这种形势的推动下，也纷纷表示愿意为社会主义建设服务、并努力改造自己。新的形势给我们提出了新的任务。在中共四川省委的领导下，我们四川民革在反右派斗争和整风运动胜利的基础上，本着党提出的“以政治思想为统帅，以劳动实践为基础，以工作岗位为基地”的原则，积极推动原属国民党军政界中上层的成员特别是散处在社会上的成员及其所联系的社会人士面向街道，面向生产，面向群众，为街道工业和公共福利事业服务，从服务的实践中加强自我改造，也就是从参与客观世界的变革中去改变自己的主观世界。
      要改造得好，听党的话是第一
    经过一年多来的服务实践和自我改造，我们大多数成员的政治思想在原有基础上有了大的进步，并对街道生产、服务事业也起了一定的积极作用。当然，事情的发展并不是直线上升的，而是经过了反复曲折的斗争过程。我们许多成员在前进的途程上曾经有过动摇和反复，对于大跃进中出现的很多新事物曾经反映了不同程度的怀疑、不满和抵触。但是尽管这样，在党的正确领导和殷切教育下，在形势的鼓舞和群众的帮助下，经过实践，总的趋势还是往前进的。例如：有些人原来对党有距离，同党的同志不愿多见面，见了面也不肯说实在话，现在已能逐步靠拢党，一有问题就向党委谈。党委给他们指方向，决疑难，许多不能解决的问题在党委支持下都得到了解决。一次又一次的事实告诉他们党是大公无私的，对一切愿意进步的人都是热情欢迎的。有了党的领导就无往而不胜。对这个根本性的问题有越来越多的成员认识到了。有的说：“要改造得好，服务得好，听党的话是第一。”有些成员原来对于党的方针政策也是有怀疑的，比如看到有一个时候城市蔬菜供应不足，就认为蔬菜生产减少了，因而怀疑以粮为纲的方针是否使农业生产失掉了平衡。后来他们参加了春节服务，帮助商业部门从郊区运输蔬菜进城，沿途看到了农业生产全面大跃进的景象，不仅蔬菜生产，而且其他各种农产品也是普遍大丰收，只因交通运输一时没有跟上，才使得蔬菜供应发生偶然失调的现象。他们这时就开始明确了党在农业上以粮为纲的方针，如同工业上以钢为纲的方针一样，也是一马当先，万马奔腾。有的成员说：“不是党的方针政策有问题，而是我们的思想观点有问题，‘一叶障目，不识泰山’。”有些成员原来对于大跃进的认识也是模糊的，说什么“再跃，人都会跃垮了。”后来他们在服务实践中，看到工农弟兄在生产战线上是智勇兼施，劳逸结合，因而干劲越鼓越大，工效越提越高，而劳动情绪也越来越饱满，事实和他们原来所臆想的恰恰相反。他们这时就开始认识了党把事物的客观规律和人的主观能动性正确地结合起来，已为持续大跃进创造了最大的可能性；同时也懂得了在大跃进中，工农群众是高歌猛进，而自己却在后面指手画脚，这正是社会主义与资本主义两种世界观的不同反映。我们这部分成员长期生活在旧军政界，向来轻视劳动，瞧不起劳动群众。通过服务实践，有些成员从自己亲身经历中体念到劳动的可贵和剥削的可耻，劳动人民的伟大和自己的渺小。有的说：“我过去不知稼穑的艰难，读李绅的‘锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土，谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦’这首诗，只是把它当作优美的文学作品来欣赏，今天读起来，感觉得分外亲切。”有的还说：“不经过劳动中的腰酸背痛，就不能在思想上实现脱胎换骨的改造。”
      不明方向找党委，不懂技术拜老师，没有办法找群众
    这些成员随着政治思想认识的逐步提高，从而在服务实践中的表现也逐渐有所进步。首先表现在劳动态度上：当初期参加服务实践时，放不下架子，有些人认为是“大材小用”。后来党提出了干部下放劳动锻炼的政策，成千上万的机关干部下乡上山，中共四川省委和省人委的许多领导同志也带头参加体力劳动，特别是我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席以及党和国家的许多领导人在修建十三陵水库的工程中，也同劳动人民一起挖土、挑泥、抬石头，大家都为之感动。在这种伟大现实的教育下，原来不肯
  “上实践之马”的大多数上马了，中途下了马的也重新上马了；原来放不下架子的人，后来到郊区运蔬菜，到公园和“花会”接待游客，到街道搞工业生产和社会服务，有些人逐步由勉强变为自然、由不安心变为安心了。其中有些人表现得比较积极，例如：有的为了搞好春节服务，整天坚持工作，儿子结婚都不肯回家；有的积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动，搞了一些创造发明；重庆有一个女性社会成员，出身于清朝皇族，一向养尊处优，现在已成为街道工作的多面手；成都市有五个成员在党委支持下白手起家办了一个竹艺生产小组，制造为四川广大劳动人民所喜爱的竹制水烟袋，现已扩大成为八、九十个人的民办工厂，去年以“满堂红”辞了旧岁，今年又以“开门红”迎了新年；有的年老体弱的同志不能出门搞活动，就在家里编史料、绘画、写诗，歌颂党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂社会主义。正如他们自己所说的：“春光无限好，老树发新枝”。其次，表现在对劳动人民的态度上：有些成员在参加春节和“花会”服务工作中，接待工农群众特别热情，说要让工农弟兄高高兴兴渡假期，好去迎接生产战线上新的战斗。工农弟兄夸奖这些同志“赛黄忠”；在参加街道工业生产劳动的一些成员，也能虚心地向老工人学技术，搞什么学什么，搞竹艺的学竹艺，搞木工的学木工，搞化工的学化工；并且逐渐体会到了党的群众路线的伟大，有事就向群众请教，从而在思想上工作上得到了群众的许多帮助。在许多生动事实的教育下，有些成员思想上逐步明确了这三条：“不明方向找党委，不懂技术拜老师，没有办法找群众。”这里值得特别重视的是：由于参加了服务实践，付出了自己的一分劳动，有些成员对社会主义建设发生了一定的感情。比如：一个在“花会”管花木的同志，隔一天不到那里去看，他心中就感到若有所失；一个搞竹艺生产的同志，见到市场上陈列有自己生产的竹烟袋，他就痴立凝视不肯遽去，由于参加了服务实践，在集体生活中受到了一些锻炼，有些成员的集体观念有所加强。比如：有的为附近居民义务修改蜂窝煤灶，为国家节约了煤炭和劳动力；有一个女同志为了防止急性传染病，积极收集粪便送医院，并给病人抬担架；由于参加了服务实践，同劳动人民有了比较认真的接触，有些成员思想上同劳动人民缩短了距离。比如：有的成员同农民弟兄交了朋友，假期节日互相往还；成都市有一个年近七十岁的社会成员，每月两次定期到远隔四十里外的郊区给农民弟兄义务看病，坚持了一年多没有中断过。而这些积极表现，得到了劳动群众的赞许，对我们这些成员改变了观感，缩短了距离，也就是说，我们这一部成员同劳动人民已经开始改善了关系。以上这些都说明，通过服务实践，我们民革多数成员在从剥削者转变为劳动者的道路上前进了一大步，同时也为祖国的社会主义建设事业起了一定的积极作用，有利于城市人民公社的建立。
        改变资产阶级立场和世界观，必须坚持不懈的努力
    但是同时我们也不能不看到：从剥削者转变为劳动者，从资本主义泥坑跳上社会主义的乐园，必须经过一个长期、复杂、曲折的斗争过程。尽管形势逼人，有的人至今仍然徘徊歧路，迟迟不肯“上实践之马”；有的人虽然参加了实践，仍然左右摇摆，起伏不居；有的学会了技术，还希望将来作“自由职业者”；有的则把服务实践作为取得政治安排的“敲门砖”。而且这些同志有一个共同点，即：旧的疙瘩解开了，新的矛盾又产生了。这说明资产阶级的立场和世界观的改变，虽然是可能的，但又不是轻而易举的，还须继续坚持不懈的努力。
    从这一段生动的事实中，使我深刻地体会到总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大和正确。正是由于总路线的照耀和大跃进的鼓舞，才能够调动一切积极因素，使先进分子更先进，后进的人们也不能不随着社会主义的大流而前进；正是由于广泛组织城市居民的经济生活和城市人民公社运动的发展，才为城市各个阶层的人民开辟了服务祖国、改造自己的广阔天地。这三大法宝，是党中央和毛主席集中全国人民的智慧而制定的，归根到底，是党和毛主席领导的伟大和正确。
    从这一段生动的事实中，我们还清楚地认识到，在党的领导下，以政治思想教育为统帅，推动民主党派中上层成员参加城市街道工业生产和公共福利事业，从服务实践中加强自我改造，这是我们民主党派加速实现自我改造的一条正确和有效的途径。
    党教导我们：“城市人民公社新的巨大的发展，是一个具有伟大历史意义的事件”，“它的成长将是实现1960年以及今后的继续跃进的一个新的重大的积极因素”。李富春副总理在报告中进一步用具体事实证明了，城市人民公社同农村人民公社一样，具有伟大的生命力，并给我们指示了今后如何努力的具体道路。我们四川民革今后决定依照党和毛主席指引的方向，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，进一步推动全省各城市的民革成员和所联系的群众以及这些成员和群众的家属，投入到伟大的城市人民公社运动中去，为街道工业生产、公共福利事业和服务事业更多更好地发挥积极作用，并在服务实践中加速自我改造的进程。我们坚决相信，有了党和毛主席的英明领导，有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀，我国的社会主义建设事业永远是胜利的，我们四川民革服务祖国改造自己的光荣任务，今后也一定能够取得新的更大的胜利。（附图片）
