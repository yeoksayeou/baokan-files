The statement said that the momentum and strength of the African nationalist movement are growing, and the desire for freedom and independence is advancing like a magnificent wave, which will sweep away all obstacles in its path.

The statement continued that the intensified suppression of Africans in various parts of Africa by imperialists clearly illustrates that imperialists are worried that Africa will no longer tolerate their evil system.

The statement pointed out that the people of Asia and Africa will do everything in their power to support the just cause of the Africans in South Africa and will take concrete measures immediately.

The statement, in referring to a series of facts about the struggle of the African people against imperialism and colonialism, emphasized that in the past year, the heroic African people have waged a glorious battle against enslavement and have achieved great victories. The statement said that the area of African countries that have now gained independence accounts for more than one-third of the entire African land, and the population is nearly half of the total African population.

The statement warned that in addition to brutal suppression, imperialists are also devising various ways to undermine and contain the African people's struggle for freedom. The statement pointed out that the fundamental goal of the imperialists has not changed.

The statement said that "Africa Day" is a symbol of the unity of goals and unity of struggle of all Africans. The statement concluded that due to the solidarity and resolute struggle of all African countries, they will gain freedom and complete independence.
