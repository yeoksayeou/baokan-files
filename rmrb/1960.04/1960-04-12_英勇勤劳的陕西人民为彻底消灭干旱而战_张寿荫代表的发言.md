Fellow Representatives:

    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Listening to these reports has greatly encouraged and enlightened us. These reports vividly summarize the brilliant achievements and successful experiences of the people of the whole country in the continued Great Leap Forward of 1959; and put forward the grand plan for the continued leap forward in 1960 and the great task of achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. We must work with the diligent and heroic people of Shaanxi to complete this year's continued leap forward in the national economy with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    Now, I would like to share some opinions on water conservancy work in Shaanxi.

    **Completing the 1960 Water Conservancy Construction Tasks Ahead of Schedule and Exceeding the Quota**

    In 1959, the people of Shaanxi, like the people of the whole country, experienced another extraordinary year under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council headed by Chairman Mao, and achieved a comprehensive and sustained Great Leap Forward on all fronts.

    On the water conservancy construction front, especially in the struggle to overcome severe natural disasters and ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production, great victories were achieved. Since last summer harvest, most areas of our province have suffered from a hundred-day drought, the worst in thirty years. The severity of the drought in some areas has been unseen in nearly a hundred years. Drought-affected areas reached thirty counties (cities), accounting for 57.7% of the province's fifty-two counties (cities); drought-affected autumn field area was more than 20 million mu, accounting for 53.4% of the sown area. Other natural disasters such as floods, waterlogging, insects, hail, and wind were also more serious than in previous years. Last winter and this spring, the province generally lacked rain and snow, and severe drought reappeared. During this period, although there was some rain, the rainfall was generally small. Runoff from rivers decreased, and many small rivers stopped flowing. According to January's observations, the moisture content within 30 centimeters of the wheat field soil decreased to 15%, and the lowest reached 7%. Drought-affected areas became even wider. All fifty-two counties (cities) in the province were generally affected by drought. Thirty-four million mu of summer crops, especially 24 million mu of wheat and cotton fields, and the sowing of early autumn crops were threatened by drought. Under these circumstances, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP, and under the direct leadership of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CCP and the Provincial People's Committee, the people of the province, holding high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, quickly launched a vigorous anti-drought and autumn-crop protection campaign with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. With the determination to conquer nature, they overcame right-leaning conservative ideas such as the "fatalistic view" and "pessimistic view," and finally overcame the drought, reaped a bumper harvest, and successfully completed the autumn sowing task. This spring, under the slogan of "Overcoming drought, ensuring a bumper harvest without rain," the people of the province have launched an even more vigorous and rapid anti-drought and wheat-protection, and anti-drought sowing campaign. The number of people participating in spring irrigation and drought resistance every day is more than three million, and has reached a maximum of four million. More than 31 million mu of spring irrigation has been completed, so that more than 80% of summer crops such as wheat have been irrigated, and anti-drought mulching has been carried out once to three times. More than 3.6 million mu of vacant land that can be irrigated has been irrigated before sowing. At present, summer crops, whether in paddy fields, dry land, plain land, former fields, mountain land, slope land, regular crops, double crops, high-yield fields and general fields, are growing very vigorously, all lush and flourishing; cotton fields and early autumn crops are also being sown intensively. This is truly "Man brings rain when heaven doesn't, bumper harvest depends on man, not on heaven," laying a good foundation for winning the first bumper harvest of crops this year and realizing the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1960.

    The anti-drought movement not only ensured high yield and bumper harvest, but also greatly promoted water conservancy construction. The number of people invested in the water conservancy movement in the province gradually increased from 500,000 at the beginning of October last year. From November to January this year, it regularly maintained 3 million people, totaling 307 million workdays, completing 1.003 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, building more than 1,100 small and medium-sized reservoirs, more than 100,000 canals, weirs, ponds, and pools, digging more than 80,000 wells, adding more than 29,000 horsepower of pumping machinery, 2.4 million mu of horizontal terraces, blocking more than 18,000 ditches, and managing more than 14,000 hilltops. The completion of the above projects has expanded the irrigated area by 5.87 million mu, accounting for 122.5% of the 1960 annual plan; renovated and improved the irrigated area by 7.58 million mu, accounting for 108% of the annual plan; water and soil conservation, initially managed more than 27,900 square kilometers, accounting for 90.5% of the annual plan; basically managed more than 17,900 square kilometers, accounting for 119% of the annual plan. All annual water conservancy construction plans were completed comprehensively, exceeding quotas, and ahead of schedule. At present, there are nine large-scale projects under construction and newly emerging in the province. Each special district and county (city) is continuing to repair and build more than 110 medium-sized projects, and each people's commune and production team is constructing more than 31,500 small water conservancy projects. The completion of the above projects will greatly strengthen the irrigation capacity of our province, and will transform thousands of acres of dry loess plateau into irrigated land; it will greatly promote the tremendous changes in the agricultural appearance of our province.

    The water conservancy movement centered on drought resistance since last summer and autumn was large in scale and magnificent in momentum. The characteristics of the movement are: the leadership is determined, the masses are full of energy, the number of people is increasing, the fighting spirit is getting stronger, the methods are getting more and more, the work efficiency is getting higher and higher, the progress is getting faster and faster, and the quality is getting better and better. It is a leap forward situation of comprehensive water management; it is also a comprehensive victory over drought and a bumper harvest in agriculture. This great victory is the victory of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. In the final analysis, it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    **Four Experiences Gained from Great Achievements on the Water Conservancy Front**

    The great victory on the water conservancy construction front in our province over the past year has not only increased many water conservancy facilities, expanded many irrigated areas, and won a bumper autumn harvest of grain and cotton; but also enabled us to gain many valuable experiences, and the ideological gains are very great. To sum up, there are four points:

    First, resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, greatly oppose right-leaning ideology, and greatly encourage revolutionary enthusiasm. Like other fronts, the water conservancy front still exists in the struggle between two roads, two lines, two ideologies, and two styles. The vast majority of people, in order to get rid of drought and win a bumper harvest, are not afraid of any difficulties, avoid any risks, find water sources, open canals, build reservoirs, dig wells, dig flood ponds, repair terraces, and build dams and weirs day and night, and try every means to compete for water with the land and grain with the sky; a few people are not like this, their right-leaning thinking is heavy, and they become blindly optimistic when the water conservancy conditions are better or when there is a little rain. Those with poor water conservancy conditions or severe drought are pessimistic. Some people still listen to fate and have a fluke mentality of waiting for rain. In response to this situation, we have carried out in-depth socialist education, using the most vivid facts of the hundred-day drought and the autumn harvest last year to refute all kinds of right-leaning views, strengthened the belief of the vast number of cadres and the masses that man can conquer nature, established the ambition to fight drought for a long time and build water conservancy on a large scale, and pushed water conservancy construction and the anti-drought struggle from a climax to a greater climax, and led the victory to a greater victory.

    Second, resolutely rely on the People's Commune and engage in mass movements on a large scale. With the People's Commune, the progress of water conservancy construction has been greatly accelerated, and the quality has also been greatly improved. Facts have proved that the People's Commune has incomparable superiority and strong vitality. It is precisely because the People's Commune has a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities, and has the characteristics of being large and public, which facilitates unified leadership in water conservancy construction, overall planning, rational utilization of water sources, unified allocation of manpower and materials, and better organization of mutual support and cooperation, and the organization of large-scale battles. For example, Xingzhen Commune in Pucheng County has a low terrain in the south and a high terrain in the north. The north can be irrigated by wells, while the south has no water source to build water conservancy. Under the unified leadership of the People's Commune, the method of transferring labor from the south to the north and transferring water from the north to the south was adopted. One thousand new wells and one thousand and five hundred old wells were dug in the north, and thirty water conservancy bases were established. The confluence of wells and long-distance irrigation formed an irrigation network for the entire commune. One hundred and sixty thousand mu of wheat was irrigated, so that more than 90% of the wheat fields in the commune were freed from the threat of drought. Yan'an Special District successively launched three large-scale mass movements last winter, transferred more than 80,000 laborers, and carried out centralized management from rivers to ditches and from slopes to mountains in the 300-li-long and 200-li-wide Yanhe River basin. In a ten-day blitz, the original 200,000 mu of irrigated area was transformed into garden fields. On this basis, another movement to block ditches and build dams was launched. In seven days, 2,964 dams were built and more than 1,000 ditches were blocked. Then, more than 90% of the labor force in the entire special district was concentrated to carry out the anti-drought struggle, and the three methods of diversion irrigation, water hauling, and ice lifting were adopted. In seven days, 1.1 million mu of land was irrigated. Such vivid examples are everywhere and too numerous to mention. Without the People's Commune and without engaging in mass movements on a large scale, it would be impossible to achieve such great achievements.

    Third, engage in technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale. During the water conservancy construction movement, various places generally carried out the "three high" movement of high speed, high work efficiency, and high quality. In terms of tool reform, we firmly grasped the two important links of earth and stone excavation blasting and transportation vehicleization. All water conservancy construction sites enthusiastically responded to the provincial party committee's call to "improve old tools, realize vehicleization, detonate millions of explosives a day, and engage in high work efficiency on a large scale," organized high work efficiency on-site meetings, and adopted a method of combining leaders, masses, and technology to engage in high work efficiency "experimental fields" on a large scale. In a very short period of time, more than 1.69 million water conservancy tools of various types were created and imitated. In particular, comprehensive reforms were carried out in the various links of loading, unloading, transporting, and pressing. The average work efficiency of water conservancy construction in the province increased from 1.8 cubic meters before November last year to 4.5 cubic meters, an increase of one and a half times. In terms of water conservancy irrigation, we prominently grasped the two links of saving water and opening up water sources. Various places have generally adopted advanced methods of using large amounts of water for diversion, using small amounts of water for concentration, irrigating distant and high land with canal water, irrigating nearby and low land with well water, accumulating small amounts and releasing large amounts, and accumulating and using simultaneously. Everywhere there is a phenomenon of more irrigated land, high efficiency, good quality, labor saving, water saving, and time saving. One flow of water from the Luohe Canal irrigated more than 2,000 mu of land day and night, which is double the amount of last winter. Highland areas generally adopted a variety of methods such as combining groups of wells, multi-stage relays, multi-bucket ropes, high-line water transportation, weighing pole forests, small vehicle groups, and pulling, transporting, carrying, and lifting to greatly accelerate the progress of drought resistance and improve irrigation efficiency.

    Fourth, strengthen specific leadership and go deep into the forefront of water conservancy construction. From the province to the county, water conservancy and drought resistance headquarters were established at all levels, and leading comrades divided the work and contracted, issued combat orders every month according to time and battle, and firmly grasped the daily progress every day. Tasks were implemented level by level, item by item, and the "five determinations" method of determining leaders, determining tasks, determining labor force, determining quality, and determining time was generally implemented, and comparison and competition activities were organized. During the movement, leading cadres at all levels went deep into construction sites and fields, to areas with lagging work and more difficulties, to eat, live, and work with the masses, take the lead in production, take the lead in irrigation, and take the lead in drought resistance. From the province to the commune, we went to where there was experience to summarize and promote. Where there were problems, we went there to study and solve them. This not only encouraged the advanced areas to become more advanced, but also drove the backward areas to overcome difficulties, catch up with and surpass the advanced, and ensure the balanced and sustained development of the movement. In order to ensure the quality of the project, various places generally carried out large-scale inspection and comparison movements. Shangluo Special District organized a "five-level meeting" of 10,000 people to inspect and accept the work, inspected more than 45,000 projects, 89% of which were qualified, and issued qualification certificates. Those that were not qualified were immediately repaired and supplemented. This ensured the quality of the project. During the movement, all aspects and departments actively responded to the great call of the provincial party committee to "strengthen the agricultural front in every possible way," and carried out comprehensive support for water conservancy construction and the anti-drought struggle. The number of troops supporting drought resistance in the province reached more than one million. Many factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and troops implemented half-day work and half-day drought resistance; night work and day drought resistance; some people worked and some people resisted drought. The industrial and commercial departments at all levels generally cleared warehouses, transferred machinery and materials to support drought resistance, and organized technical workers to go to communes and teams to help repair machines; cultural, educational, and health departments organized performance troupes and medical teams to go to the mountains and villages to perform for the drought resistance and water conservancy army, and to serve the drought resistance and water conservancy army; colleges and universities and scientific and technological departments organized strong technical teams to go deep into the front line of drought resistance and water conservancy, conduct investigations and research, and provide technical guidance. Everywhere there was a situation where office learning went to the fields, technical guidance went to the fields, machinery repair went to the fields, material supply went to the fields, and medical and health care went to the fields. All walks of life mobilized together, and workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants twisted into one rope and carried out a tenacious struggle with drought with one heart and one mind. This not only vigorously supported drought resistance, accelerated the development of water conservancy construction, and promoted the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, but also further strengthened the work of all aspects and departments and promoted the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy.

    **After Overcoming the Spring Drought, We Must Also Prevent the Summer Drought**

    Although our province's water conservancy construction and anti-drought struggle have achieved great victories, the threat of the current spring drought has not been completely eliminated. Even if the spring drought is completely eliminated, we will encounter drought in the future. In particular, wheat has already turned green and is about to joint, and spring sowing has already begun, requiring a large amount of water and sufficient base moisture to ensure the first bumper harvest of crops this year and lay a good foundation for the autumn bumper harvest. To this end, we must adhere to putting politics in command, engage in mass movements on a large scale, continue to overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas, prevent and overcome any complacency and slackness, establish the ambition to fight drought for a long time, and carry the anti-drought struggle to the end to completely overcome the spring drought and prevent the possible summer drought. We must try every means to give full play to the potential of existing water conservancy facilities, improve utilization, and enhance drought resistance effectiveness. While adhering to the anti-drought struggle and building large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, we must also continue to rush to repair small water conservancy and temporary drought resistance projects. Continue to engage in tool reform and technical innovation on a large scale, and engage in high work efficiency movements on a large scale. Conscientiously summarize and promote experience, and accelerate the development of water conservancy construction.

    We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, adhering to putting politics in command, adhering to the mass line, conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's writings, and constantly improving the level of leadership, we will be able to give fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    If there is anything inappropriate, please criticize and correct it, fellow representatives.

    英勇勤劳的陕西人民为彻底消灭干旱而战
    张寿荫代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。听了这些报告，使我们受到极大的鼓舞，得到极大的启示。这些报告，生动地总结了全国人民在1959年继续大跃进中所取得的辉煌成就和成功经验；提出了1960年继续跃进的宏伟计划和提前实现全国农业发展纲要的伟大任务。我们一定要和勤劳英勇的陕西人民一道，为多快好省地完成今年国民经济的继续跃进、提前实现全国农业发展纲要而努力奋斗。
    现在，我就陕西的水利工作讲一些意见。提前超额完成1960年度兴修水利任务
    1959年陕西人民同全国人民一样，在以毛主席为首的中共中央和国务院的正确领导下，又经历了一个不平凡的年代，实现了各个战线上的全面持续的大跃进。
    在水利建设战线上，特别是在战胜严重自然灾害、保证农业生产丰收的斗争中，取得了巨大的胜利。我省从去年夏收以后，全省大部地区，遭受了三十年来从未有过的百日大旱，局部地区的严重程度，为近百年来所未有，受旱地区达三十个县（市），占全省五十二个县（市）的57.7％；受旱秋田面积两千多万亩，占播种面积的53.4％；其他洪、涝、虫、雹、风等自然灾害，也比往年严重。去冬今春全省又普遍的缺少雨雪，又出现了严重的干旱。在此期间，虽然降了一些雨，但一般雨量不大。各河径流减少，有不少的小河断了流。据元月份的观测，麦田土壤三十厘米以内含水率下降到15％，最低的达7％。受旱地区更广。全省五十二个县（市），普遍受旱。三千四百万亩夏季作物，特别是二千四百万亩小麦和棉田、早秋的播种都受到干旱威胁。在这种情况下，全省人民在中共中央八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，在中共陕西省委和省人民委员会的直接领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，以冲天的革命干劲，迅速地开展了声势浩大的抗旱保秋运动，以人定胜天的决心，克服了“定局论”、“悲观论”等右倾保守思想，终于战胜了干旱，获得了丰收，并胜利地完成了秋播任务。今春，全省人民在“战胜干旱，无雨保丰收”的口号下，又掀起了一个声势更大、进展更快的抗旱保麦、抗旱播种运动。每日参加春灌抗旱的人数在三百万以上，最高曾达四百万人，完成春灌面积三千一百多万亩，使全省80％以上的小麦等夏田作物得到灌溉和抗旱垅浇一次到三次，三百六十多万亩的空地能够灌溉的都进行了播种前灌溉。使目前夏天作物不论水地、旱地、川地、原地、山地、坡地、正茬、回茬、丰产方和一般田，大都生长的很茁壮，一片葱绿，欣欣向荣；棉田和早秋作物也正在紧张地进行播种。这真是“天不降雨人降雨，丰收由人不由天”，为夺取今年第一料庄稼大丰收，实现1960年农业生产继续大跃进，打下了良好的基础。
    抗旱运动不仅保证了丰产丰收，而且大大促进了水利建设。全省投入水利运动的人数，由去年10月开始的五十万人，逐渐增加，11月到今年元月经常保持了三百万人，共做三亿零七百万工日，完成土石方十亿零三千万立方米，建成中小型水库一千一百多座，渠、堰、塘、池十万多处，打井八万多眼，新增的抽水机械二万九千多匹马力，水平梯田二百四十多万亩，堵沟一万八千多条，治理山头一万四千多个。以上工程的完成，共扩大灌溉面积五百八十七万亩，为1960年度计划的122.5％，整修改善灌溉面积七百五十八万亩，为年计划的108％；水土保持，初步治理二万七千九百多平方公里，为年计划的90.5％；基本治理一万七千九百多平方公里，为年计划的119％。全面超额和提前完成了全年的水利建设计划。目前全省正在继续建设和新兴大型工程有九处。各专、县（市）正在续修新修的中型工程一百一十多处，各人民公社、生产队正在施工的小型水利工程三万一千五百多处。以上工程的建成，将会大大加强我省灌溉能力，将使千万亩以上的旱塬变为水浇地；将会大大促进我省农业面貌的巨大变化。
    去年夏秋季以来的以抗旱为中心的水利运动，规模宏大，声势壮阔。运动的特点是，领导决心大，群众干劲足，人数越来越多，斗志越来越强，办法越来越多，工效越来越高，进度越来越快，质量越来越好。是个全面治水的跃进局面；也是个全面战胜干旱，夺得农业的丰收局面。这个伟大的胜利，是党中央和毛主席领导的胜利，是党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利。归根结底，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    获得水利战线上巨大成就的四项经验　
    一年来，我省水利建设战线上的巨大胜利，不只是增加了许多水利设施，扩大了许多灌溉面积，夺得了粮棉秋季丰收；而且使我们取得了许多宝贵的经验，思想上的收获非常大。集中起来，有四条：
    第一，坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，大反右倾思想，大鼓革命干劲。水利战线和其他战线一样，仍存在着两条道路、两条路线、两种思想、两种作风的斗争。绝大多数人为了摆脱干旱，为了夺取丰收，他们不怕任何困难，不避任何风险，不分昼夜找水源、开水渠、筑水库、打水井、挖涝池、修梯田、打坝堰，千方百计向地争水，与天争粮；少数人就不是这样，右倾思想重重，水利条件较好的或者下了一点小雨，就盲目乐观起来了。水利条件差的或者旱情比较严重，就消极悲观。还有的人听天由命，存在着等天下雨的侥幸心理。针对这种情况，深入地开展了社会主义教育，用去年大旱百日、秋田丰收的最生动的事实，驳斥了形形色色的右倾观点，坚定了广大干部和群众的人定胜天的信念，树立了长期抗旱、大兴水利的雄心壮志，把水利建设和抗旱斗争由高潮推向更大的高潮，由胜利引向更大的胜利。
    第二，坚决依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动。有了人民公社，水利建设的进度大大加快了，质量也大大提高了。事实证明了人民公社有着无比的优越性和强大的生命力。正是由于人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，具有一大二公的特点，便于在水利建设上统一领导，全面规划，合理利用水源，统一调配人力、物力，更好地组织互相支援、协作，组织大兵团作战。例如：蒲城县的兴镇公社，地势南低北高，北部可以打井灌溉，而南部无水源兴修水利，在人民公社的统一领导下，采取了南劳北调，北水南调的办法，在北部打新井一千眼，掏旧井一千五百眼，建立了三十个水利基地，合井并流远浇，把全社组成了一个灌溉网，十六万亩小麦得到了灌溉，使全社90％以上的麦田摆脱了干旱威胁。延安专区去年冬季连续开展了三次大规模的群众运动，抽调了八万多劳力，在三百里长二百里宽的延河流域面积上，大搞由川到沟、由坡到山的集中治理，突击了十天，把原有的二十多万亩灌溉面积，变成了园田化。在这个基础上，又进一步掀起了堵沟打坝运动，七天工夫打坝两千九百六十四座，堵沟一千多条。接着又集中了全专区90％以上的劳力，开展了抗旱斗争，采取了引灌、拉水、抬冰三箭齐发的办法，七天工夫浇地一百一十万亩。诸如此类的生动事例，到处可见，举不胜举。如果没有人民公社，不大搞群众运动，要获得这样巨大的成就是不可能的。
    第三、大闹技术革新和技术革命。水利建设运动中，各地普遍地开展了高速度、高工效、高质量的“三高”运动。在工具改革方面，狠狠地抓住了土、石方开挖爆破化、运输车子化两个重要环节。各个水利工地都热烈地响应了省委提出的“改良旧工具，实现车子化，日放百万炮，大搞高工效”的号召，组织高工效现场会，采取领导、群众、技术三结合的办法，大搞高工效“试验田”。在很短的时间里，创制和仿制了各种水利工具一百六十九万多件。特别是在装、卸、运、压各个环节上进行了全面改革。全省水利建设平均工效由去年11月以前的一点八立米，提高到四点五立米，增长了一倍半。在水利灌溉方面，突出地抓住了节约用水和广开水源两个环节。各地普遍地采用了大水分渠用，小水集中用，渠水浇远地、高地，井水浇近地、低地，小蓄大放，边蓄边用的先进方法。到处出现了浇地多、效率高、质量好、省劳力、省水量、省时间的现象。洛惠渠一个流量的水一昼夜浇地两千多亩，比去冬提高了一倍。高原地区普遍采取了群井结合、多级接力、一索多桶、高线运水、称杆林、小车群和拉、运、担、抬等多种多样的办法，大大加速了抗旱进度，提高了灌溉效能。
    第四、加强具体领导，深入水利建设第一线。从省到县，各级成立了水利抗旱指挥部，领导同志分层包干，按时间，分战役，月月发布战斗令，天天狠抓日进度。逐级逐项落实了任务，普遍实行了定领导、定任务、定劳力、定质量、定时间的“五定”办法，组织开展了评比竞赛。在运动中，各级领导干部深入工地、田间，到工作落后和困难较多的地区，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，带头生产、带头灌溉，带头抗旱。从省到社，那里有经验，就到那里去总结推广。那里有问题，就到那里研究解决。既鼓励了先进地区更加先进，又带动了落后地区克服了困难，赶上和超过了先进，保证了运动的均衡持续的发展。为了保证工程质量，各地都普遍开展了大检查、大评比运动。商?专区组织了“五级会师”万人检查验收团，检查了四万五千多处工程，合格的达89％，发给合格证，不合格的，立即进行抢修抢补。从而保证了工程质量。在运动中，各方面各部门都积极地响应了省委“千方百计加强农业战线”的伟大号召，开展了全面支援水利建设和抗旱斗争。全省支援抗旱的大军达一百多万人，许多工厂、企业、机关、学校、部队，都实行了半日工作，半日抗旱；晚上工作，白天抗旱；部分人工作，部分人抗旱。各级工商部门普遍清查仓库，抽调机械物资支援抗旱，组织技术工人下社下队帮助检修机器；文教卫生部门组织演出团、医疗队上山下乡为抗旱、水利大军演出，为抗旱、水利大军服务；高等院校和科学技术部门，组织了强大的技术队伍，深入抗旱、水利第一线，进行调查研究，技术指导。到处出现了办公学习到田，技术指导到田，机械修配到田，物资供应到田，医疗卫生到田，各行各业齐出动，工农兵学商扭成一股劲，同心协力与干旱进行了顽强的斗争。这样不仅有力的支援了抗旱，加速了水利建设的发展，促进了农业生产的继续大跃进，而且进一步加强了各方面各部门的工作，促进了国民经济的全面大跃进。
    战胜春旱，还要防止夏旱
    我省水利建设和抗旱斗争，虽然获得了伟大的胜利，但是当前春旱的威胁并没有完全解除，即是春旱完全解除了，今后还会遇到干旱。特别是目前小麦已经返青，即将拔节，春播已经开始，需要大量的水分和足够的底墒，才能够保证今年第一料庄稼大丰收，并给秋季大丰收打好基础。为此，我们一定要坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，继续克服各种右倾保守思想，防止和克服任何自满松劲情绪，大立长期抗旱的雄心壮志，把抗旱斗争进行到底，彻底战胜春旱，防止可能遇到的夏旱。我们一定要千方百计地充分发挥现有水利设施的潜力，提高利用率，增强抗旱效能。在坚持抗旱斗争和兴修大中型水利工程的同时，我们还要继续抢修小型水利和临时抗旱工程。继续大搞工具改革和技术革新，大搞高工效运动。认真地总结推广经验，加速水利建设的发展。
    我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，依靠总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，认真学习毛主席著作，不断地提高领导水平，更充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，我们就一定能够排除万难，实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    不妥之处，请各位代表批评指正。
