Developing Flax Production
Speech by Committee Member Li Peiji

In order to develop the national economy, changing the cultivation of sesame to flax in northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, can sufficiently supply the people's productive strength. Flax is an annual herb, about two to three feet tall, with alternate lanceolate leaves and blue or white flowers; both varieties can be used to make linen. It matures in just over one hundred days from sowing to harvest. Therefore, flax cultivation is suitable for cold and temperate zones, which is why the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are the largest flax-producing countries. Flax fiber has extremely high tenacity, and fabrics woven from it are lustrous, not inferior to cotton. The seeds can be pressed for oil and used to make printing ink and medicines. More and more countries around the world are planting flax. Our country currently has only one flax mill, the Harbin Flax Mill in Heilongjiang Province. Construction of the mill began in July 1950 and went into operation in October 1952. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, its achievements are significant. It now has 14,000 spindles, 600 looms, and a complete set of bleaching, dyeing, and processing equipment. Currently, it has more than 5,000 employees who pay great attention to worker education, improving cultural and technical skills. The main products currently produced are various fine linen fabrics, linen jacquard fabrics, and linen canvas. Recently, through technological innovation, the mill has overcome the limitation of spinning 28-count yarn and is now able to spin 42-count fine linen yarn and has successfully trial-woven twill fabric, small patterned fabric, various colored fabrics, linen jacquard tablecloths, and more than 20 other types, which are exquisitely crafted, beautiful, and fresh products. Flax production was originally unknown in our country, let alone flax enterprises. The Harbin Flax Mill is the founder of our country's flax industry and can be said to be an advanced foundation for the development of China's flax textile industry. Such achievements are indeed the result of socialist construction and the correctness of the Communist Party's industrial policy. Further development will benefit the people, which is a great boon for people's livelihood. According to the places where flax is planted in our country, none are more prevalent than the counties near Xuanhua in northern Hebei, the area inside and outside Yanmen Pass in northern Shanxi, and the counties near Datong. In addition, the counties under the jurisdiction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been major sesame-producing areas for many years. Every autumn, the harvested seeds are pressed into sesame oil for people to eat, and the remaining sesame stalks are used as firewood. Occasionally, they are soaked and peeled to make rope. However, due to the laborious manual operation, very few villagers soak sesame stalks for hemp; most are used as firewood. Whether this type of sesame is the same as flax, or a different species, or originally inferior flax seeds, is unknown. Because the quality of flax seeds deteriorates if planted in the same place for more than three or four years, it is necessary to select new seeds from another place for planting in order to grow vigorously and have good quality. If we can promote the change to flax cultivation, the people will be happy to plant it. And the state should build a large-scale flax mill in Xuanhua or Datong in advance, and build simple processing plants in county towns or towns with convenient transportation in various flax-producing areas, equipped with pressing machines or stripping machines, so that after the flax is harvested, the people's communes can send it to the processing plants. The processing plants then comb and make clean hemp, and then transport it to the flax mill for storage, ready for beating, humidifying, combing, roving, spinning, sizing, drying, bleaching, and other procedures to make various linen fine fabrics for sale. This will surely be a great source of wealth for the national economy. Furthermore, if flax is to be harvested for seeds to be pressed into oil for people to eat, the harvest can be delayed by a few days for the seeds to mature. The remaining hemp stalks can still be stripped for hemp, but the quality is slightly inferior, not as good as the fine quality of early-harvested fiber. However, people need edible oil and must take this into consideration first. If, after harvesting the seeds, the hemp stalks are soaked in water and stripped into hemp using manual presses, the flax factory can also purchase it, so that the people will not still use it as firewood, which is of no benefit to the people and is detrimental to economic crops. This is a thought I have, and whether it can be implemented depends on experts conducting detailed research and formulating a plan before it can be implemented.

    发展亚麻生产
    李培基委员的发言
    为发展国民经济，在河北、山西、陕西、甘肃的北部及内蒙古自治区、宁夏回族自治区，生产胡麻的地方改种亚麻，可以充足人民生产的力量。亚麻为一年生草本，高约二、三尺，叶互生，为披针状，花有蓝白二色，此两种类皆可以制做麻丝。由播种到收获期间不过百日就能成熟。故种植亚麻宜于寒温地带，所以苏联和德意志民主共和国为产亚麻最多的国家。亚麻纤维韧度极强，织成布品，富有光泽，并不亚于棉花，种子可以榨油，并能制做印刷墨与药料。世界各国种植亚麻者日见其多，吾国现有亚麻厂仅为黑龙江省哈尔滨亚麻一厂。该厂兴建1950年，在是年7月间开始动工，至1952年10月间投入生产。为苏联无私的援助，故其成就甚大，现有一万四千枚纱锭，六百台织布机，以及全套的漂白、染色、加工等设备。目前有职工五千余名，很注重工人教育，提高文化，加强技术的能力。现下生产主要的产品，为各种亚麻细布、亚麻提花布及亚麻帆布等。该厂近来技术革新由纺二十八支纱的限制，现在已能纺四十二支亚麻细纱并试织成功斜纹布、小花纹布、各种颜色布、亚麻提花台布等二十余种，为厂中精工美  丽新鲜的产品，亚麻在吾国原不知道生产、更谈不到亚麻企业，哈尔滨亚麻厂实为吾国亚麻企业的创始者，并可说是我国亚麻纺织工业发展的一个先进基础。这样的功绩实为社会主义建设的成就，是共产党工业政策方针的正确。从此发展，使人民得享其利，岂不是民生的幸运。按吾国种植亚麻的地方，莫过于河北的北部宣化附近各县，山西的北部雁门关内外，以及大同附近各县。又内蒙古自治区所属各县，宁夏回族自治区所属各县，为历年盛产胡麻的地方。每到秋获收成种子榨做胡麻油，以供人民食用，所遗胡麻茎子充作烧柴，间有浸沤剥洗成麻以便制做绳索。不过乡村人民因手工操作费事，用胡麻茎沤麻者实在甚少，大多数作了烧柴。此类胡麻是否与亚麻种类相同，抑或别为一种或原本亚麻种子变劣。因亚麻性质若在一个地方种植超过三、四年后，种子即可变劣，须要到另一地方选择新的种子种植，方能生长茂盛品质良好。若能提倡改种亚麻人民当能乐为种植，并预先由国家在宣化或大同建设一个大规模的亚麻厂，并在各生产亚麻的地方，交通利便的县城或市镇建设简易的加工厂，设置压榨机或剥脱机，使亚麻收获后由人民公社送至加工厂，由加工厂梳理制成净麻，然后运至亚麻厂存储，以备打制成麻再为加湿梳理、搓条纺纱、浆烘漂白等手续，制成各种麻丝细布。向外销售，对于国民经济，必能是一大利源，且亚麻如要收获种子榨制成油，以供人民食用。收获稍晚几天子粒即可成熟，所遗留的麻茎仍能剥麻，不过质量稍劣，不及早获的纤维品质精良，但是人民须要食油不能不预先顾及，若于收子后，将麻茎水浸、用手压机剥脱成麻。亚麻工厂也可以收购，总不使人民仍如旧日用作烧柴，无益于人民，有损于经济作物。这个办法是吾所想的一点意思，能否实行，有待于专家人员详为研究，拟定计划，方能施行。
