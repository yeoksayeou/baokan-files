Launch Bumper Harvest Plots, Plant More High-Yield Crops, and Conduct Production Increase Competitions
Inner Mongolia and Liaoning are Joyful and Horses are Galloping in Busy Spring Planting

　　This newspaper's Hohhot dispatch on the 12th: Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have enthusiastically launched a grain production increase campaign. More than 350,000 commune members throughout the region are sowing the seeds of the 1960 Great Leap Forward at a high speed of 600,000 mu per day. By the end of March, the region had completed 63.6% of its wheat sowing plan, more than double the same period in 1959. In previous years, Inner Mongolia generally started sowing around ten days before Qingming (April 5th), but this year a high tide of wheat sowing formed on March 10th, about half a month earlier than in previous years. It is expected that wheat sowing can be basically completed by mid-April this year, twenty days earlier than in 1959. In spring wheat sowing, new tools, new technologies, and new measures have been widely adopted this year, changing the old production methods of extensive cultivation, and the sowing quality has been significantly improved compared with previous years. Three leagues, Hulunbuir, Jirem, and Bayannur, dispatched 3,596 animal-powered ten-row seeders, and 80% of the sown area was machine-sown. Yikezhao League, Ulanqab League, Hohhot and Baotou widely promoted improved close-planting drills, with row spacing of about six inches, achieving uniform sowing and close planting. This year, various parts of the autonomous region also widely selected improved varieties, appropriately increased the seeding rate, and disinfected all seeds. More than 90% of the 5 million mu of spring wheat sown throughout the region was fertilized, with an average fertilizer application of 3,000 to 5,000 jin per mu. Most of these fertilizers are high-quality human and animal manure.
　　This year, encouraged by the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 and 1959, farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia launched an enthusiastic production increase campaign. Commune members of Jirem League launched a "Double Four, Five Increase" movement (that is, the entire league plants 4 million mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 400 jin per mu; increase the sown area, increase the area of high-yield grain crops, increase the area of large-scale high-yield fields, increase the area of mixed and intercropping, and increase specific production increase measures); Bayannur League aims to cross the Yellow River in terms of grain yield per unit area in 1960, with the average yield per mu of the entire league exceeding 400 jin. Yikezhao League launched the "Double Thousand Two" movement, striving for each agricultural population to produce 1,200 jin of grain and 1,200 jin of potatoes throughout the year. At present, a mass production movement centered on implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is being widely carried out throughout the region. According to the production plans proposed by the people's communes in various places, the 1960 sowing plan decided by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee has been greatly exceeded.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: Liaoning Province's spring plowing and sowing campaign, characterized by "early, more, comprehensive, and good," has achieved a successful start and frequent good news. The sowing time for various crops this year is generally about twenty days earlier than last year. Currently, the sown area of spring wheat, millet, corn, soybeans, sorghum, flax, cotton, etc. in the province has increased more than five times compared with the same period last year, and the sowing quality is also unprecedentedly good. At present, 4 million laborers throughout the province are fighting on the front lines of spring plowing and preparation, and many young students, urban residents, government cadres, factory and mine workers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are also actively supporting spring plowing and preparation. The fields are full of lively scenes of people and horses galloping. The preparation work for spring plowing and sowing in Liaoning Province this year is better than in any previous year. Since last winter, various places have taken socialist education as the guiding principle and focused on water, fertilizer, soil, and basic farmland construction. After the Spring Festival, in accordance with the spirit of "early start, early initiative," a comprehensive upsurge in preparation for farming was launched, resulting in a good situation of early start, high enthusiasm, fast progress, good quality, and comprehensive arrangement in the preparation work.
　　In this year's preparation for farming and spring plowing, various places have conscientiously implemented the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high-yield and multiple harvesting, expanding the cultivated area by reclaiming wasteland on the one hand, and vigorously developing high-yield plots and expanding the sown area of high-yield crops on the other hand. At present, the province has newly reclaimed more than 660,000 mu of wasteland. While reclaiming wasteland, various places have also actively carried out the "no idle land" movement, striving to plant every inch of land. In order to achieve intensive cultivation and further improve the yield per unit area, a surge of communes and teams vigorously developing high-yield plots has emerged throughout the province. The area of high-yield plots generally accounts for about 30% of the cultivated area. The cultivation techniques of high-yield plots in various places have generally reached the standard of garden-style fields, achieving flat ground like a mirror, straight ridges like a line, and sufficient water and fertilizer.
　　In the preparation for farming and spring plowing production, various places have conscientiously implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements." In addition to grasping the preparation for farming and spring plowing of grain crops, the province has made appropriate arrangements for the production of cotton, oil, vegetables, tobacco, flax, silk, fruits, sugar, medicine, miscellaneous crops, etc., striving for an all-round leap forward.
　　In order to speed up the progress of preparation for farming and spring plowing, various places have comprehensively launched a tool reform movement. More than 250,000 pieces of improved agricultural tools for spring plowing and sowing have been reformed and created throughout the province. The work efficiency has generally increased by one to five times compared with using old-fashioned agricultural tools, playing a huge role in ensuring timely sowing.

    大办丰产方　多种高产作物　开展增产竞赛
    内蒙古辽宁人欢马腾忙春播
    本报呼和浩特12日电　内蒙古自治区各族农民热烈开展了粮食增产运动。全区有三十五万多名公社社员正以日播六十万亩的高速度，撒下了1960年跃进的种子。到3月底，全区小麦播种计划已完成63.6％，相当于1959年同时期的两倍多。往年内蒙古各地在清明（4月5日）前十天左右才开始普遍播种，今年在3月10日便形成小麦播种高潮，比往年提早了半个月左右。预计今年小麦播种到4月中旬可以基本结束，比1959年提前二十天。在春小麦播种中，今年各地普遍采用了新工具、新技术和新措施，改变了耕作粗放的陈旧生产方法，播种质量比往年有显著提高。呼伦贝尔、哲里木和巴彦淖尔等三个盟出动了三千五百九十六台畜力十行播种机，80％的播种面积实现了机播。伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟、呼和浩特和包头市普遍推广了改良密植耧，播种行距都在六寸左右，达到了匀播密植的要求。今年自治区各地还广泛选用了良种，适当地增加了播种量，并对全部籽种进行了消毒处理。全区播种的五百多万亩春小麦，90％以上施了肥料，一般每亩施肥量为三千到五千斤。这些肥料大部分是质量较好的人畜粪肥。
    今年内蒙古各族农民，在1958年、1959年农业生产连续大跃进的鼓舞下，开展了热烈的增产运动。哲里木盟公社社员开展了“双四、五增”（即全盟种四百万亩高额丰产田，亩产四百斤；增加播种面积，增加粮食高产作物面积，增加大面积高额丰产田，增加混种间作面积，增加具体增产措施）运动；巴彦淖尔盟要在1960年粮食单位面积产量跨过黄河，全盟平均亩产量超过四百斤。伊克昭盟开展了“双千二”运动，争取每个农业人口全年生产一千二百斤粮食，一千二百斤薯类。目前，一个以贯彻农业“八字宪法”为中心的群众性生产运动，正在全区广泛开展。根据各地人民公社提出的生产计划来看，已经大大超过了内蒙古自治区人民委员会决定的1960年播种计划。
    据新华社沈阳11日电　辽宁省今年以“早、多、全、好”为特色的春耕春播运动，旗开得胜，捷报频传。今年各种作物的播种时间普遍比去年提早二十天左右。目前全省播种的春麦、谷子、玉米、大豆、高粱、麻类、棉花等，比去年同期增加五倍多，播种质量也空前良好。现在全省每天有四百万劳动大军奋战在春耕备耕战线上，许多青年学生、城市居民、机关干部、厂矿职工、人民解放军官兵也积极支援春耕备耕，田野里到处是人欢马腾的生动景象。今年辽宁省的春耕播种准备工作比以往任何一年都好。各地从去年冬季开始，就以社会主义教育为纲，大抓水、肥、土和农田基本建设。春节过后，又根据“一早百早、争取主动”的精神，掀起了全面的备耕高潮，使备耕工作出现了动手早、干劲高、进度快、质量好、安排全面的大好局面。
    在今年的备耕春耕中，各地认真贯彻了多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，一面开荒扩大耕地面积，一面大搞丰产方和扩大高产作物的播种面积。目前全省新开荒地已经达到六十六万多亩。与开荒的同时，各地还积极地开展了无闲地运动，力争做到寸土必种。为了作到精耕细作和进一步提高单位面积产量，全省出现了社社队队大搞丰产方的热潮，丰产方的面积一般都占耕地面积的30％左右。各地丰产方的耕作技术一般都达到了园田化标准，做到了地平如镜，埂直如线，水足粪饱。
    在备耕春耕生产中，各地认真地贯彻了“以粮为纲，全面安排”的方针，全省除了抓紧粮食作物的备耕和春耕工作外，对棉、油、菜、烟、麻、丝、果、糖、药、杂等各种生产都做了适当安排，力争全面跃进。
    为了加快备耕和春耕的进度，各地全面地开展了工具改革运动。全省改革和创制的春耕春播改良农具有二十五万多件，工作效率普遍比用旧式农具提高了一倍到五倍，对保证适时播种发挥了巨大作用。
