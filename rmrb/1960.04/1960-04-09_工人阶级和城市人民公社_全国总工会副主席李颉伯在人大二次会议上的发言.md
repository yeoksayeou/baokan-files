Comrades Deputies:
    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    Now I would like to talk about the situation of urban people's communes. Some cities in our country began experimenting with urban people's communes in the autumn of 1958. Over the past year or so, they have developed greatly. In accordance with the principle of voluntariness, a number of urban people's communes have been established in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions throughout the country, with a commune population of nearly 20 million. Most cities in Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang and other provinces have basically achieved people's commune-ization. Now, urban people's communes are being rapidly and massively established, and have begun to form a surging and magnificent mass movement. It can be predicted that in a not-too-long period of time, cities across the country will basically achieve people's commune-ization. The urban people's commune movement is a revolutionary mass movement of great historical significance. The development of this movement will further profoundly change the political and economic outlook of our cities and the spiritual outlook of the urban people, and will create extremely favorable conditions for accelerating our country's socialist construction and the transition to communism in the future.

    The great development of urban people's communes, like that of rural people's communes, is not accidental. First of all, it is the product of our country's economic and political development, and the product of the general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward in production. It is the result of the widespread improvement of the communist consciousness of our people after the rectification movement and large-scale communist education. The continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production also urgently requires the realization of people's commune-ization in cities in order to adapt to and promote the high-speed development of productive forces. Secondly, various regions have achieved great success and accumulated a lot of experience in the trial operation of urban people's communes, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of urban people's communes, which has made more and more people in cities demand the establishment and development of people's communes. Thirdly, in many cities, the organization of production and collective life of urban street residents through street (lane) committees and other forms has laid a very good foundation for the establishment of urban people's communes.

    Urban conditions are different from those in rural areas. Therefore, organizing urban people's communes requires adopting forms suitable for urban areas based on urban characteristics. At present, the specific organizational forms of urban people's communes in various places are roughly as follows: one is the people's commune established with large state-owned factories and mining enterprises as the center; the second is the people's commune established with organs and schools as the center; and the third is the people's commune established mainly by street residents. Regardless of the form of urban people's commune, the most active and enthusiastic participants are workers, staff, their families, and other working people, who actively play a backbone role in the various activities organized by the commune.

    Over the past year or so, urban people's communes have demonstrated strong vitality and are developing forward, breaking through all the shackles of old things. It is constantly enriching its work content, creating new experiences, and becoming increasingly complete in organization. Urban people's communes must be continuously consolidated, improved, and strengthened. As the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in December 1958 pointed out, it will "become a tool for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities, become a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution and people's livelihood and welfare, and become a social organization combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and integrating government administration with commune management." The established urban people's communes have already shown great effect in developing production, organizing life, further liberating labor, strengthening people's communist education, changing customs and habits, and transforming society.

    When organizing urban people's communes and street economic organizations, all parts of the country start by organizing production, taking the development of production as the most central task. It first serves the production of state-owned factories and mines, and at the same time serves the lives of urban and rural people and agricultural production. Over the past year or so, urban people's commune industry and street industry have developed greatly. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of state-owned enterprises, adhering to the Party's policy of relying on the masses, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, relying on self-reliance, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, adopting the method of starting from scratch, making do with whatever is available, starting from small to large, and from indigenous to modern, fully mobilizing the masses, and launching a mass movement to run industry on a large scale, commune industries have been established like bamboo shoots after a rain, and have been continuously consolidated, developed, and improved. Now, urban people's commune industry and street industry have developed into an important new force on our country's industrial front, and have extremely brilliant development prospects. According to preliminary statistics, urban people's communes and street organizations have established more than 56,000 industrial production units, employing nearly 2 million people; the output value in 1959 was more than 2 billion yuan, equivalent to more than twice the output value of local state-owned enterprises nationwide in 1949. Urban people's communes can uniformly organize and rationally arrange urban labor, gradually organizing the people in the city who are able to work, turning consumers into producers; under the guidance of the national plan, they can fully utilize the edge materials, waste materials, waste products of large factories, and so-called urban waste, and engage in comprehensive utilization on a large scale, turning useless things into useful things. Because the urban people's commune is a social organization combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and integrating government administration with commune management, it is conducive to the unified mobilization of positive factors from all aspects under the leadership of the Party, organizing communist large-scale cooperation, tapping the various production potentials in society, and promoting the high-speed development of social productive forces. For example, in 1959, the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin solved more than 2,300 cooperation projects between large, medium, and small enterprises within the commune through various cooperations organized by the commune, and organized the production cooperation of the repair workshops of several state-owned factories in the commune. After the commune implemented "ring power supply" and "ring water supply" within the commune, it is further realizing "ring steam supply," "ring gas supply," and "ring transportation." This further exploited the potential of the enterprise's equipment, rationally used equipment, greatly improved labor productivity, and increased production. Another example is the Huidui People's Commune in Tianjin, which, in the process of running industry on a large scale, focused on the needs of large factories, used the waste materials and waste liquid of the paper mill as raw materials, and engaged in comprehensive utilization on a large scale. In a short period of time, it established nine production units such as aluminum sulfate and plasticizers, with an annual output value of 1.72 million yuan in 1959. Such facts are too numerous to mention. Everyone knows that there are many such projects that require cooperation in large factories and mining enterprises in cities, and there are many so-called waste materials that can be comprehensively utilized. By doing so, we can use national resources more rationally and economically and create more wealth for society. This is fully in line with the Party's policy of increasing production and practicing economy and developing production at high speed. Facts have proved that urban people's communes have a lot to offer in terms of unifying the organization of production, organizing cooperation, developing comprehensive utilization, and tapping potential.

    After these urban people's commune industries and street industries were consolidated and improved, they further mobilized the masses to launch a production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and production efficiency continued to rise. Judging from the production situation of urban people's commune industry and street industry in the first quarter of this year, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's requirement in the report that the output value of urban people's commune industry and street industry in 1960 should increase by about 100% compared with 1959 is not only achievable, but can be greatly exceeded.

    Since the trial operation of urban people's communes in 1958, a large amount of labor has been liberated. According to preliminary statistics, urban people's communes and street organizations in various cities have transferred more than 3.4 million people (80% of whom are women) to state-owned factories, mines, enterprises and institutions in the past year or so, helping large factories and mines to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor and ensuring the completion of the leap forward plan of large factories and mines. Because the vast majority of these new workers are family members of nearby workers, it is not necessary to build new dormitories and other welfare facilities like recruiting new workers from rural areas in the past, which also saves a lot of investment for the state.

    According to the principle of combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, some urban people's communes have included a number of agricultural production brigades. By adopting methods such as "linking factories with teams" and "contracting by area," factories, organs, schools, and other units are organized to actively support the development of suburban agricultural and sideline production and the technological transformation of agriculture in terms of technology, equipment, and labor.

    While vigorously grasping production, urban people's communes have vigorously developed collective life and welfare undertakings and service undertakings, and comprehensively organized people's lives. Over the past year or so, relying on the masses, and adhering to the principle of voluntariness, they have vigorously run public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and service stations, turning the scattered and cumbersome housework into large-scale, collective socialist economic undertakings, freeing thousands of workers' families and other working people's housewives from the constraints of housework. According to preliminary statistics, people's communes and street organizations in major and medium-sized cities have established more than 50,000 public canteens, with more than 5.2 million people eating in them; more than 42,000 nursery organizations, with more than 1.2 million children in nurseries (the above do not include canteens and nurseries run by factories, organs, and schools). There are more than 66,000 neighborhood service stations run by communes and streets, with more than 440,000 staff members. The large-scale establishment of these public canteens and collective life and welfare undertakings not only further liberated a large number of housewives in cities from housework, realized the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life, allowing women to embark on the path of thorough liberation, but also facilitated the development of production. The socialization of housework and the collectivization of life are the inevitable products of high-speed socialist construction, and the ideals and wishes that the vast number of workers, especially women, have dreamed of for many years. As many people praised, "In the past, housework was exhausting, and we had to take care of children and cook; Chairman Mao led us to turn over, and now we have also established people's communes; if we want to eat, we go to the canteen, and service stations provide dismantling, washing, sewing and mending; children go to nurseries, and the elderly go to happy homes; housework is socialized, and we devote ourselves to production." With the continuous leap forward in production and the development of collective life and welfare undertakings, the income of the vast number of urban women who participate in social labor has increased. According to some typical surveys in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Harbin and other cities, the average household income of those who participated in social labor generally increased by 20% to 35%, and their lives have improved.

    While organizing the people's economic life, urban people's communes and street organizations in various places have also vigorously organized the people's cultural life. The communes have run many primary schools, middle schools, and red and expert schools, and organized the vast number of commune members to launch a movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. The enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, staff, their families, and other working people for learning politics, culture, and science and technology is very high. The commune also established amateur theater troupes and built clubs, actively organizing mass cultural and sports activities. Establish mass health care organizations, and widely carry out mass patriotic health movements centered on eliminating the four pests. For example, the Hongqi People's Commune in Shenyang City adopted a method that combines medical and health departments with mass health care organizations, so that the commune has hospitals and maternity hospitals, commune-run factories have health stations, production organizations have health rooms, and residential courtyards have health workers, which greatly promoted the development of patriotic health movements and health care undertakings. Urban people's communes not only vigorously grasp technological revolution, but also make a lot of noise about cultural revolution, which accelerates the change of the urban social landscape and people's spiritual outlook in all aspects.

    Urban people's communes highly organize the vast number of urban residents in production and life, and under the leadership of the Party, further transform people from all walks of life in cities with the ideology of the working class, turning consumers into producers, turning consumer streets into production streets, and turning exploiters into self-reliant laborers.

    After people participate in social labor, they are exercised in production and collective life, participate in political and cultural studies, improve their ideological awareness and cultural level, and change their original spiritual outlook. They love labor, love the collective, actively produce, and enthusiastically serve the masses and socialist construction. Labor is glorious, unity and mutual assistance have become a new social trend. The selfish concepts and patriarchal thoughts left over from the old society are despised by people everywhere. People are constantly creating model deeds in their work. Many people have been rated as advanced producers and advanced workers. Workers' families and street women have made significant contributions to society and the people after participating in work; at the same time, they have also improved their social status. They are no longer "family members" and "housewives" in a subordinate position, but female workers and female commune members. One woman said with emotion after her lover always addressed her as "my wife" in the past, but now calls her comrade, "I thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart, and thank the People's Commune. The People's Commune has made me participate in production and got liberated, and even 'he' calls me 'comrade'." Women's liberation is the measure of social liberation. Women in our country have embarked on a new stage of thorough liberation, which is one of the signs that the socialist revolution on our country's political and ideological front is deepening. Many women reflected that since the establishment of the commune and participation in labor, the family has increased countless warmth, and unity between neighbors has been greatly strengthened. There is such an example in the Zhengzhou Hongqi People's Commune. Ma Zhenjiang and Ba Shiren lived next door to each other, and they hadn't spoken for seven years because their children were fighting; now they work and live together, resolving the old knot of many years. The masses praised, "The People's Commune is a flower, and one flower blooms and fragrances thousands of families; the knots of thousands of years are untied in one morning, and we unite to produce and laugh; the leadership of the Party is really good, and the commune is omnipotent."

    At present, under the leadership of the Party and illuminated by the general line, the vast number of workers, staff, their families, and other working people in cities across the country have begun to set off a upsurge in running urban people's communes. They are further widely organized in production and life according to socialist principles, running commune industries, street industries, suburban agriculture, public welfare undertakings, and public canteens on a large scale, in order to promote the thorough transformation of urban social life and accelerate socialist construction.

    The working class is the most advanced class. The vast number of workers and staff have the strongest desire to quickly change the poor and blank face of our country and build socialism at high speed, and shoulder the lofty historical mission of building socialism and communism. They should resolutely stand at the forefront of this movement with the most active and enthusiastic attitude, and regard the establishment, consolidation and further development of urban people's communes as their glorious task. Contribute their strength to constantly enrich the content of the commune, expand the influence of urban people's communes, and universally establish and develop urban people's communes. The spirit of the vast number of workers and staff in some cities who have proposed to do a good deed for the establishment of urban people's communes is worth advocating and carrying forward.

    Every achievement made in our country's socialist construction has caused panic and unease among imperialists. When the people of our country are celebrating the advent of the high tide of the urban people's commune movement with joy and excitement, the declining, despicable and shameless imperialists and their echo worms are once again launching vicious attacks and slanders against the urban people's communes in our country, just as they did against the rural people's communes in our country, and clamoring madly. Running urban people's communes on a large scale is the urgent demand and ardent wish of the vast number of workers and urban working people in our country, and it is the inevitable law of historical development in our country. No force can stop the advance of this historical wheel. The urban people's commune movement will surely develop forward with an overwhelming momentum and thunderous force, and all vicious attacks and slanders will be futile. Let them weep and clamor. The people of the whole country will raise the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune even higher, and under the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, continue to advance victoriously along the road indicated by the Party with full confidence.

### 工人阶级和城市人民公社  全国总工会副主席李颉伯在人大二次会议上的发言

专栏：

    工人阶级和城市人民公社
    全国总工会副主席李颉伯在人大二次会议上的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于争取提前实现农业发展纲要的报告。
    现在我仅就城市人民公社状况谈一谈。我国有些城市从1958年秋季开始试办城市人民公社，一年多来，已经有了很大的发展，全国各省、市、自治区，按照自愿的原则，已经建立了一批城市人民公社，公社人口近二千万人。河南、河北、黑龙江等省多数城市，已经基本上实现了人民公社化。现在，城市人民公社正在迅速地大量地成立起来，已经开始形成汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的群众运动。可以预料，在不太长的时间里，全国城市将基本上实现人民公社化。城市人民公社运动是一个具有伟大历史意义的革命群众运动，这个运动的发展，必将进一步使我国城市的政治、经济面貌和城市人民的精神面貌发生深刻的变化，将为加速我国社会主义建设和将来向共产主义过渡创造极为有利的条件。
    城市人民公社的大发展，和农村人民公社一样，不是偶然的。首先，它是我国经济和政治发展的产物，是社会主义建设总路线和生产大跃进的产物。是我国人民经过整风运动和大规模的共产主义教育，普遍提高了共产主义觉悟的结果。工农业生产连续大跃进，为了适应和促进生产力的高速度发展，也迫切要求城市实现人民公社化。其次，各地在城市人民公社试办中取得了巨大成就，取得了很多经验，显示出城市人民公社无比优越性，使城市中有愈来愈多的人民要求举办和发展人民公社。第三，在许多城市中，通过街道（里弄）委员会等形式，组织了城市街道居民的生产和集体生活，已经为建立城市人民公社打下了极为良好的基础。
    城市情况和农村有所不同，因此，组织城市人民公社就需要根据城市的特点，采取适合城市的形式。目前各地城市人民公社的具体组织形式，大体上有如下三种：一是以大型国营厂、矿企业为中心建立的人民公社；二是以机关、学校为中心建立的人民公社；三是以街道居民为主体建立的人民公社。不论那种形式的城市人民公社，首先最积极、最踊跃参加的都是职工、职工家属和其他劳动人民，他们在公社所组织的各项活动中，积极地发挥了骨干作用。
    一年多来，城市人民公社表现了强大的生命力，正在冲破一切旧事物的束缚向前发展。它正在不断地充实自己的工作内容，创造新的经验，在组织上日益完备。城市人民公社一定要不断地巩固、提高和壮大起来。正如1958年12月党的八届六中全会决议所指出的那样，它必将“成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者，成为工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织”。已建立的城市人民公社，在发展生产、组织生活、进一步解放劳动力、加强人民的共产主义教育、移风易俗、改造社会等方面，都已经显示了巨大的作用。
    全国各地在组织城市人民公社和街道经济组织的时候，都是先从组织生产入手，把发展生产作为最中心的任务。它首先为国营厂矿生产服务，同时为城乡人民生活服务，为农业生产服务。一年多来，城市人民公社工业和街道工业已经有了很大的发展。在党的领导下和国营企业的帮助下，本着党的依靠群众、因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生、勤俭办企业的方针，采取白手起家、因陋就简、由小到大、由土到洋的办法，充分发动群众，开展了大办工业的群众运动，使公社工业像雨后春笋般地建立起来，并且不断地得到了巩固、发展和提高。现在，城市人民公社工业和街道工业已经发展成为我国工业战线上的一支重要的新生力量，并且具有极其光辉灿烂的发展前途。据初步统计，目前城市人民公社和街道组织已办起了工业生产单位共有五万六千多个，从业人员近二百万人；1959年产值为二十亿元以上，相当于1949年全国地方国营企业产值的二倍多。城市人民公社能够统一组织和合理安排城市的劳动力，把城市中能够劳动的人逐渐组织起来，变消费者为生产者；能够在国家计划的指导下，充分利用大厂的边材、废料、废品和所谓城市的废物，大搞综合利用，变无用的东西为有用。由于城市人民公社是工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织，它有利于在党的领导下，统一调动各方面的积极因素，组织共产主义大协作，把社会上的各种生产潜力挖掘出来，促进社会生产力的高速度发展。例如哈尔滨香坊人民公社1959年通过公社组织的各种协作，就解决了社内大中小企业之间的协作项目二千三百多项，并组织了社内几个国营工厂的机修车间的生产合作。该社在实行了公社范围内的“环形供电”和“环形供水”以后，又进一步正在实现“环形供蒸气”、“环形供煤气”、“环形运输”。这样就进一步发挥了企业的设备潜力，合理使用设备，大大提高了劳动生产率，增加了生产。再如天津市灰堆人民公社，在大办工业中，围绕着大厂的需要，以造纸总厂的废料、废液为原料，大搞综合利用，在短短的时间内，就办起了硫酸铝、塑化剂等九个生产单位，1959年年产值达一百七十二万元。诸如此类的事实不胜枚举。大家都知道，城市各大厂矿企业中这类需要协作的项目是很多的，可以加以综合利用的所谓废弃物资也是很多的。这样做，就能够更合理、更节约地使用国家资源，为社会创造出更多的财富。这是完全符合党的增产节约和高速度发展生产的方针的。事实证明：城市人民公社在统一组织生产、组织协作、发展综合利用、挖掘潜力等方面是大有可为的。
    这些城市人民公社工业和街道工业在巩固和提高之后，又进一步发动群众，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，生产效率不断上升。根据今年一季度城市人民公社工业和街道工业的生产情况来看，李富春副总理在报告中提出的1960年城市人民公社工业和街道工业的产值比1959年增长一倍左右的要求，不但是可以完成的，而且是可以大大超过的。
    1958年试办城市人民公社以来，解放了大量劳动力。据初步统计，各城市人民公社和街道组织，一年多来仅向国营厂矿企业和事业单位就输送了三百四十多万人（其中妇女占80％）帮助大厂矿企业解决劳动力不足的困难，保证了大厂矿企业跃进计划的完成。由于这一批新工人绝大多数是附近的职工家属，可以不需要像以往从农村招收新工人那样，增建宿舍等生活福利设备，这也为国家节约了大量投资。
    根据工农商学兵相结合的原则，有一部分城市人民公社已经包括了若干农业生产大队。采取了“厂队挂钩”、“分片包干”等办法，组织工厂、机关、学校等单位，从技术、设备、劳力等方面，积极支援郊区农副业生产的发展和农业的技术改造。
    城市人民公社在大抓生产的同时，大力举办了集体生活福利事业和服务事业，全面地组织了人民生活。一年多来，它依靠群众，按照自愿的原则，大办公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和服务站，把分散的、繁琐的家务劳动变成了大规模的、集体的社会主义经济事业，使成千上万的职工家属和其他劳动人民的家庭妇女摆脱了家务劳动的牵累，据初步统计，各大中城市的人民公社和街道组织，已办了公共食堂五万多个，就餐人数达五百二十多万人；托幼组织四万二千多个，入托儿童一百二十多万人（以上均不包括工厂、机关、学校办的食堂、托儿所）。公社和街道办的邻里服务站有六万六千多个，工作人员四十四万多人。这些公共食堂和集体生活福利事业的大量兴办，不仅又进一步地把城市中大量的家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，实现家务劳动社会化和生活集体化，使妇女走上彻底解放的道路，而且有利于生产的发展。家务劳动社会化和生活集体化，是高速度建设社会主义的必然产物，是广大职工、特别是妇女多少年来梦寐以求的理想和愿望。这正如许多群众所赞扬的那样：“过去家务心操烂，带孩作饭都得干；毛主席领导翻了身，如今又把公社办；若要吃饭进食堂，拆洗缝补服务站，小孩入了托儿所，老人进了幸福院；家务劳动社会化，一心一意搞生产。”随着生产的不断跃进和集体生活福利事业的发展，广大城市妇女参加社会劳动后，收入增加了。根据北京、天津、沈阳、郑州、哈尔滨等城市的一些典型调查，凡是参加了社会劳动的人，平均每户收入一般都增加20％到35％，生活有了改善。
    各地城市人民公社和街道组织在组织人民经济生活的同时，也大力组织了群众的文化生活。公社举办了许多小学、中学、红专学校，组织广大社员开展了学习马列主义、毛泽东著作运动。广大职工、职工家属和其他劳动人民学习政治、文化和科学技术的热情十分高涨。公社还举办了业余剧团，建了俱乐部，积极地组织了群众的文娱体育活动。建立群众性的卫生保健组织，广泛地开展了以除四害为中心的群众爱国卫生运动。例如沈阳市红旗人民公社采取了医疗卫生部门和群众保健组织相结合的办法，做到了公社有医院和妇产院，社办工厂有保健所，生产组织有保健室、居民大院有保健员，大大促进了爱国卫生运动和保健事业的发展。城市人民公社不仅大抓技术革命，而且大闹文化革命，它从各方面加速了城市社会面貌和人们的精神面貌的改变。
    城市人民公社从生产上、生活上把城市广大居民高度组织起来，在党的领导下，用工人阶级的思想进一步改造城市各个阶层的人，变消费者为生产者，变消费的街道为生产的街道，变剥削者为自食其力的劳动者。
    人们参加社会劳动后，在生产和集体生活中受到锻炼，参加了政治、文化学习，提高了思想觉悟和文化水平，改变了原来的精神面貌。她们热爱劳动，热爱集体，积极生产，热心为群众服务、为社会主义建设服务。劳动光荣，团结互助，已经成为一种新的社会风尚。工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬的共产主义风格大大发扬。旧社会遗留下来的自私观念、宗法思想，到处受到人们的唾弃。人们在工作中不断地创造出模范事迹。很多人被评为先进生产者和先进工作者。职工家属和街道妇女参加工作后，为社会为人民作出了重大贡献；同时，也提高了自己的社会地位。她们不再是处于附属地位的“家属”和“家庭妇女”，而是女职工和女社员了。有一个妇女，过去她爱人写信总是称呼她“我妻”，现在则称呼为同志，她感动的说：“我从内心里感谢共产党和毛主席，感谢人民公社。人民公社使我参加了生产，得到了解放，连‘他’也称呼我‘同志’”。妇女解放是社会解放的尺度。我国妇女已经走上了彻底解放的新阶段，这是我国政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命更加深入的标志之一，许多妇女反映：成立了公社，参加了劳动，家庭不知增加了多少温暖，邻里之间大大加强了团结。郑州红旗人民公社有这样一个例子，马振江和巴世仁隔墙居住，因为小孩打架，七年没说话；现在一起工作和生活，解开了多年的老疙瘩。群众歌颂说：“人民公社一枝花，花开一朵香万家；千年疙瘩一朝解，团结生产笑哈哈；党的领导真是好，公社就是神通大”。
    目前，全国各城市的广大职工、职工家属及其他劳动人民，在党的领导和总路线的照耀下，已经开始掀起了一个大办城市人民公社运动的热潮。他们正在进一步按照社会主义原则，从生产上、生活上广泛地组织起来，大办公社工业、街道工业、大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，以推动城市社会生活的彻底改造，加速社会主义建设。
    工人阶级是最先进的阶级，广大职工对迅速改变我国一穷二白的面貌，高速度地建设社会主义，有着最强烈的愿望，对建设社会主义和共产主义担负着崇高的历史使命，应以最积极最热忱的态度，坚决地走在这个运动的前列，把建立、巩固和进一步发展城市人民公社当作自己的光荣任务。为不断充实公社的内容，扩大城市人民公社的影响，为普遍建立和发展城市人民公社贡献自己的力量。有些城市的广大职工，纷纷提出为建立城市人民公社作一件好事的精神，是值得提倡和发扬的。
    我国的社会主义建设中所取得的每一成就，都引起帝国主义的惊慌和不安。当我国人民正以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆贺我国城市人民公社运动高潮到来的时候，日暮穷途、卑鄙无耻的帝国主义者及其应声虫，又在像对我国农村人民公社一样，对我国城市人民公社进行恶毒地攻击和污蔑，进行疯狂地叫嚣。大办城市人民公社是我国广大职工和城市劳动人民迫切要求和热烈愿望，是我国历史发展的必然规律。任何力量都不可能阻止这一历史车轮前进。城市人民公社运动一定会以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，汹涌澎湃地向前发展，而一切恶毒地攻击和污蔑都是徒劳的。让他们悲泣叫嚣去吧。全国人民将更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，在伟大的党和毛主席的领导下，沿着党所指示的道路，信心百倍地继续胜利前进。
