Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 11th: The people of Shashi, a national advanced health unit and Hubei Province's model health city, under the leadership of the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels, are holding high the banner of continuous revolution, steadily improving the patriotic health campaign.

Since the beginning of this year, the people of Shashi, based on the principle of "addressing both symptoms and root causes, with emphasis on addressing root causes," have vigorously transformed toilets, pigsties, ditches, sewage pits, and sewage ponds, fundamentally eliminating breeding grounds for diseases, and have achieved remarkable results. In the past three months, all of the city's eight hundred-plus toilets have been sealed and provided with underground passages, adhering to the system of frequent cleaning, frequent manure removal, frequent disinfection, and frequent flushing; the five hundred and ninety-nine newly built and renovated pigsties and thirty-three large-scale pig farms have met the requirements of clean inside and outside the pen, clean livestock bodies, clean feed troughs, and clean feed utensils; the city has dredged and cleaned thirty-nine thousand meters of underground ditches, and filled in sewage pits and ponds covering an area of more than four thousand three hundred square meters, and has ensured that large and small ditches form a system, allowing rainwater and sewage to flow smoothly. Through water conservancy construction, the Wang Gong Commune in the suburbs has eliminated schistosomiasis snails over an area of more than four hundred and ninety thousand square meters; combined with the health campaign, it has accumulated more than fourteen thousand tons of various fertilizers. At present, the city is combining with municipal construction to renovate dark and humid old houses; the city has also established an environmental sanitation management office, all catering industries and residents' canteens have generally formulated sanitation management regulations, increased sanitation facilities, and implemented tableware disinfection; street prevention and guidance stations have been universally established and epidemic reporting officers have been established; all units with more than fifty people have established health rooms, and units with fewer than fifty people have assigned a part-time health worker; based on the spirit of early prevention, early detection, early isolation, and early treatment, infectious disease prevention drugs have been universally taken, and a community health service network centered on hospitals has been established. Thanks to the series of effective measures mentioned above, the incidence of spring epidemics this year has significantly decreased compared to the same period last year. 80% of the city's nurseries and kindergartens have not had any illnesses; the incidence of several major infectious diseases has decreased by more than 75%.

The people of Shashi have realized in the health campaign that "pests can be eliminated, and diseases can be eradicated," and have further established the determination that "pests must be eliminated, and diseases must be eradicated," and are working together with one heart to consciously promote sanitation. From the Municipal Party Secretary and the Mayor to the elderly and children in the masses, they now frequently use their spare time and holidays to eliminate "four pests" with sanitation tools in hand. Residents automatically clean indoors and outdoors every day and adhere to a major cleaning once a week; cadres of organs insist on cleaning for ten minutes before and after work every day; employees of factories and mines have established a clean shift handover system. The street residents' "four nos" (no spitting, no littering of fruit peels and paper scraps, no urinating and defecating, no eating along the street) and "four diligences" (diligent in washing clothes and bedding, diligent in bathing, diligent in getting haircuts, diligent in cutting fingernails) hygiene habits have become a common practice. Various organs, schools, and residents' groups have also consciously established a personal hygiene assessment system.

The people of Shashi have maintained the sanitation red flag for more than two years, mainly because the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has consistently attached importance to sanitation work, and has adhered to the principle of "secretary taking the lead and strengthening leadership" in organization. In addition to the secretary, three members of the Municipal Party Committee are responsible for the specific leadership work in sanitation, and each basic-level Party committee and administrative unit is also equipped with leading cadres specifically in charge of sanitation work. When carrying out mass sanitation blitzes, the secretaries of Party organizations at all levels personally went into action and participated in sanitation labor together with机关 cadres and residents. In vigorously promoting the health campaign, the Municipal Party Committee has always adhered to the ideological spirit of continuous revolution, enabling cadres and the masses to always maintain abundant fighting enthusiasm. In order to organically integrate hygiene with production and work, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the slogan of "Hygiene for production, production emphasizes hygiene," and implemented "four unifications" (unified leadership, unified planning, unified deployment, unified inspection and evaluation) and "three combinations" (combining with production, combining with ideological movements, combining with municipal construction) in work arrangements. In order to guide the in-depth and balanced development of the movement, Party committees at all levels also established 594 "experimental fields" for health work. The combination of blitzes and routine work in the movement enables the movement to be both vigorous and lasting.

Party committees at all levels have boldly mobilized the masses in the health campaign, enabling sanitation work to achieve successive victories. Since 1959, through inserting red flags and establishing pacesetters, taking the Liaozi River area and Chen Xiaozhen's family, which were sanitation red flags in the city, as examples, the patriotic health campaign of "one thousand model figures, one hundred advanced collectives, and ten thousand activists" of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward has been widely carried out throughout the city. At present, there are 132 "Liaozi River" style sanitation areas, 12,431 sanitation families like the "Chen Xiaozhen" family, and 43,587 sanitation models and activists. The masses consciously took action to vigorously promote the health campaign, and also solved many problems in municipal construction. In the past two years, the total length of ditches and sewers repaired in the fundamental cure project for sanitation reached more than 310,000 meters, and the area of sewage pits and ponds filled and renovated reached more than 320,000 square meters. Thanks to the vigorous mass movement, the actual national investment only accounted for 7.4% of the original budget completely taken over by the state.

At present, Shashi's health campaign is developing vigorously, welcoming "May Day" International Labor Day with greater achievements.

    害必除  病必灭
    沙市爱国卫生运动步步提高
    据新华社武汉11日电　全国卫生先进单位、湖北省卫生模范城市沙市的人民，在中共沙市市委和各级党委的领导下，高举不断革命的旗帜，使爱国卫生运动步步提高。
    今年以来，沙市人民根据“标本兼施，以治本为主”的方针，大力改造厕所、猪圈、沟渠、污水坑和污水塘，从根本上消灭病害的滋生场所，获得了显著的成绩。三个月来，全市八百多个厕所，全部实行密封和暗道，坚持了勤打扫、勤出粪、勤消毒、勤冲洗的制度；新建与改建的五百九十九个猪圈和三十三个大型养猪场，达到了栏圈内外净、牲畜身体净、食槽洗刷净、饲料用具净的要求；全市疏洗阴沟三万九千米，填平污水坑、塘面积四千三百多平方米，并做到了大小沟道成系统，使雨水、污水畅流。郊汪公社通过水利建设，消灭钉螺面积四十九万多平方米；结合卫生运动，积各种肥料一万四千多吨。目前，全市正结合市政建设，对阴暗、潮湿的古老房屋进行改造；全市还成立了环境卫生管理所，所有饮食行业和居民食堂，普遍订立了卫生管理条例，增加了卫生设施，实行餐具消毒；普遍建立街道预防指导站和建立了疫情报告员；凡五十人以上的单位，都建立了保健室，五十人以下的单位配有一个兼职保健员；根据早预防、早发现、早隔离、早治疗的精神，普遍服了传染病预防药，建立了以医院为中心的地段保健工作网。由于采取了上述一系列的有效措施，今年春季流行病比去年同期显著下降。全市80％的托儿所和幼儿园，没有发生过病情；几种主要传染病发病率下降达75％以上。
    沙市人民在卫生运动中体会到“害可除、病可灭”，进一步树立了“害必除，病必灭”的决心，上下一股劲，自觉搞卫生。从市委书记、市长到群众中的老年人和小孩，现在经常利用业余时间和假日手执卫生工具，消灭“四害”。居民们每天自动打扫室内外，并坚持一星期一次大扫除；机关干部每天坚持上下班前后十分钟搞清洁；厂矿企业的职工建立清洁交接班制。街道居民“四不”（不随地吐痰，不随地丢果皮纸屑，不随地大小便，不沿街吃东西）、“四勤”（勤洗衣被，勤洗澡，勤理发，勤剪指甲）的卫生习惯，已蔚成风气。各机关、学校、居民小组还自觉地建立了个人卫生的鉴定制度。
    沙市人民已保持卫生红旗两年多，主要由于中共沙市市委一贯重视卫生工作，在组织上坚持了由“书记挂帅、加强领导”的原则。这个市除书记外，市委委员中有三人分工负责卫生方面的具体领导工作，各基层党委和行政单位，也都设有领导干部专管卫生工作。在开展群众性的卫生突击运动时，各级党组织的书记都亲自出动，和机关干部、居民一道参加卫生劳动。在大搞卫生运动中，市委始终坚持了不断革命的思想精神。使干部和群众始终保持了充沛的战斗热情。为了使卫生和生产、工作有机地结合起来，市委提出了“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”的口号，在工作安排上实行“四统一”（统一领导、统一计划、统一布置、统一检查评比）、“三结合”（结合生产、结合思想运动、结合市政建设）。为了指导运动深入平衡地发展，各级党委还办了卫生工作“试验田”等五百九十四个。运动中突击与经常相结合，使运动既能轰轰烈烈，又能经常持久。
    各级党委在卫生运动中放手发动群众，使卫生工作节节胜利。从1959年以来，通过插红旗，树标兵，以全市卫生红旗廖子河地段和陈孝珍家庭为榜样，在全市范围内广泛开展了“一千个模范人物、一百个先进集体、一万个积极分子”的学先进、赶先进和帮后进的爱国卫生运动，目前全市“廖子河”式卫生地段已有一百三十二个，像“陈孝珍”家庭一样的卫生家庭已有一万二千四百三十一户、卫生模范和积极分子已达四万三千五百八十七人。群众自觉地行动起来大搞卫生运动，在市政建设方面也解决了不少问题。两年多来，卫生治本工程中修沟渠下水道总长达三十一万多米，填平和改造污水坑、塘面积三十二万多平方米，由于大搞群众运动，国家实际投资数只占原来国家全部包下来的预算数7.4％。
    目前，沙市的卫生运动正蓬勃发展，以更大的成绩迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
