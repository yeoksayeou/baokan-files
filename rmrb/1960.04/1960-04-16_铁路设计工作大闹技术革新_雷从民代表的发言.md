Comrades:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Accounts and the Draft National Budget for 1960," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Report on Achieving the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule," and I will resolutely strive for their realization.

**High Efficiency Utilization of Existing Lines, High-Speed Construction of New Lines**

Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the brilliance of the General Line, the people of the whole country, following the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, have further exerted their revolutionary vigor and infinite wisdom, enabling socialist construction to advance with giant strides, and have victoriously overfulfilled the 1959 National Economic Plan. This is a victory for the leadership of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for the Three Red Banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and a victory for adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements.

On the basis of the great leap forward victories achieved successively in 1958 and 1959, the people of the whole country continue to implement the Party's General Line for building socialism, striving with greater enthusiasm to achieve the task of a newer and greater leap forward in 1960.

In the field of railway transportation, in order to ensure the realization of the all-round leap forward task of socialism, we must strive to complete and overfulfill the arduous and glorious tasks stipulated in the national plan, such as a freight volume of 720 million tons, the construction of 8,389 kilometers of new railways, and the reconstruction of 421 kilometers of railways. In order to achieve this leap forward target, we must: utilize railways with high efficiency and give full play to the potential of existing equipment; complete new infrastructure construction at high speed, with high quality, and at low cost; and further establish ambitious goals and grand plans, advancing comprehensively towards the four modernizations of railways (mechanization, automation, electrification, dieselization), the two lines (automatic production lines, continuous production lines), and high, large, precise, advanced, and new technologies, climbing the peak of science, and completing a vast railway network equipped with the latest modern technologies as quickly as possible. Experience has proven that as long as we firmly uphold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Party, adhere to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, adhere to the mass line, vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution, and give full play to our subjective initiative, we will certainly be able to successfully complete our glorious tasks and better meet the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction.

In order to accelerate the development of socialist construction in our country, railway workers, like the working people on all production fronts, launched a magnificent mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution during the Great Leap Forward, and have already achieved brilliant achievements. I will now report on a few experiences of the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways in carrying out this mass movement. Any inadequacies should be criticized and corrected by the representatives.

**It is a Technical Revolution Movement, and also an Ideological Revolution Movement**

Over the past two years, all employees of our First Design Institute, under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, resolutely opposed thoroughly rightist thinking, mustered greater revolutionary vigor, and vigorously promoted technological innovation and technological revolution, bringing about great changes in their mental outlook. The masses' minds have been greatly liberated, the communist style of daring to think and act has been greatly promoted, the superstition that design work cannot engage in mass movements and cannot develop at high speed has been broken, 2,031 outdated rules and regulations that hindered the development of productive forces have been abolished or revised, and working methods and systems suitable for production leap forward have been formulated. The relations of production have been greatly improved, productive forces have been liberated, and the phenomenon of buck-passing has been transformed into close cooperation. All employees of the institute have put forward a total of 800,8519 reasonable suggestions, with an adoption rate of 43%, of which 62 have been promoted throughout the railway system, 1,260 advanced experiences have been promoted, more than 160 new products have been improved and trial-produced, 736 scientific and technological research projects have been completed, and 174 production and technical experiences have been summarized, promoting the continuous leap forward in production and ensuring the smooth completion of tasks. Especially under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, after thoroughly crushing the conspiracy of a small number of right-leaning opportunists to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, our institute has ushered in a new situation of "unity of purpose, galloping horses, myriad purples and reds, and a new look in everything," and after entering 1960 forty-four days ahead of schedule, it has won a "good start" in 1960, reaping a double harvest in thought and production. Now our institute has launched a vigorous mass movement centered on high speed and high quality, and with technological innovation and technological revolution as the guideline, and in March of this year, it began the first of the "Five Great Campaigns," determined to push technological innovation and technological revolution to a greater and newer climax. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely achieve greater and newer victories.

Practice has proven that to revolutionize technology, we must first revolutionize our thinking. The technical revolution process in our institute over the past two years has also been a process of struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideas, and a process of constantly breaking superstitions and liberating thinking. Before 1958, there was a phenomenon called the "Five Major Lags" in the railway design process, that is, the railway was built, but the design drawings for the station, locomotive, water supply, building construction, signaling and other equipment required for transportation could not all be delivered for construction. The situation of the Great Leap Forward was pressing, and the question facing the designers was whether to strive to be the vanguard of the Great Leap Forward, or to be content with lagging behind and become a stumbling block for the construction and operation departments? The answer, of course, was the former. At that time, someone proposed a comprehensive standardization of station design, but it was opposed by some people. They said: "Station design involves five or six types of work, and moving a turnout will affect the overall situation. It is too complicated to standardize. If you want to do it, you have to assign several experts to do it for a year or two." The Party branch organized the masses to speak out and debate in a timely manner. The Communist Youth League members found that throat design was the key, and then immediately launched a mass movement to engage in standardized station design. The best plan was finally determined from more than 20 plans, and the matter, which was originally thought to take a year or two, was completed in only eight days, fundamentally reversing the "Five Major Lags" and giving a head-on blow to right-leaning conservatives and conditionalists! For example, in the standardized design of traction substations, some people also said, "The current design has been reformed, and it is already fast enough to only take ten to thirteen days. The potential for improvement is not great, and the technology is complicated, so it cannot be standardized." This is a right-leaning sentiment of being content with the status quo and lacking revolutionary enthusiasm. In response to this erroneous thinking of "technological innovation has reached its limit," the Party branch organized the masses to study the theory of continuous revolution and launched a debate. As a result, the design was dissected into ten parts, and groups were formed to focus on how to standardize the problem. Finally, a technical demonstration meeting was held, and the problem was solved in only twenty-eight minutes using assembly design, increasing work efficiency by 160 times. Those who said "technological innovation has reached its limit" and "the potential for improvement is not great" finally admitted defeat. In addition, some people did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between technological innovation and production, and opposed technological innovation to production, thinking that there were too few people to engage in technological innovation if production was undertaken, and that technological innovation was put aside when production was busy, without realizing that technological innovation is the most effective way to promote production. The actual examples of the masses engaging in technological innovation educated this group of people, so that they also actively participated in the upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution.

Through the practical education of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and closely combining it with the study of Mao Zedong Thought, the political and ideological consciousness of all employees of the institute has been greatly improved, the communist style of cooperation has been greatly promoted, and a hub that was originally known for buck-passing is now called a "cooperation expert" by the masses. Studying Chairman Mao's works has become a conscious requirement of the masses, and they regard studying Mao Zedong Thought as the key to solving difficulties, forming an unprecedented upsurge in learning. The spiritual outlook of the entire institute has turned to a new stage, promoting the continuous leap forward in production. This fully proves the truth that "to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize our thinking."

**Create Momentum and Encourage Enthusiasm, Seize Opportunities and Set Off Upsurges**

Creating momentum and encouraging enthusiasm, and constantly stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses, is a necessary condition for vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution. Seizing opportunities and setting off upsurges, and proposing new battle slogans according to the situation, is a necessary driving force for the continuous progress of the movement. Without relying on the masses, technological innovation will not succeed; without giving full play to subjective initiative, the movement will not last. Therefore, the movement must be vigorous from the beginning, not lukewarm. Major publicity activities must be carried out, repeated mobilizations must be made, the situation must be clarified, the direction must be pointed out, and battle slogans must be put forward to open up the situation. In fact, after the masses are mobilized, they themselves create many lively and vivid forms of publicity, such as radio conferences, victory report meetings, production sports meetings, technical performance meetings, and fighting and competition meetings. The walls are also decorated with paintings and ribbons, and various charts are full of content. It is truly a myriad of purples and reds, and a new look in everything. The gongs and drums are so loud that it seems like a happy event is held every day, which strongly promotes the development of the movement. After the situation is opened up, a mass "learn, catch up, surpass, and help" competition movement is organized to insert red flags and establish pace-setters. Pace-setters are constantly cultivated to make the advanced even more advanced, playing a "leading" role in the movement, so as to promote the continuous development of the movement, and the pace-setters are required to help the backward when they see them, and to deliver treasures to their door, so that the backward can also reach the advanced level and leap forward together. In the competition, the masses also created nearly sixty kinds of rich, colorful, lively and vivid competition forms: such as pace-setter competitions, opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, train hook-up competitions, major battles, minor battles, three helps (advanced help backward, skilled help novice, fast help slow), four finds (find opponents and take the capable as teachers, find reasons and get to the bottom, find experiences and learn with humility, find gaps and compete for every bit), and so on. Mutual competitions were launched between deputy directors and between deputy chief engineers of the institute, forming a situation of competition everywhere, competition among everyone, and competition in everything, and constantly moving forward through inspection and evaluation. In this way, 160 red flag bearers, 239 pace-setters, 37 representatives of advanced collectives at the provincial and Ministry of Railways levels, and 245 representatives of advanced collectives at the institute level emerged from the more than 3,000 employees of the institute. 1,147 pairs participated in the opponent competition, and 225 pairs participated in the counterpart competition. In the movement, attention should be paid to the changes in the surrounding situation at any time, pay attention to the signs of new things, seize the opportunity, set off a new upsurge, and put forward new battle slogans. Only in this way can we prevent the masses' sense of relaxation, constantly muster their enthusiasm, maintain their vigorous fighting spirit and full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and continuously deepen the development of the movement, advancing wave after wave. In February of this year, our institute seized the opportunity of the Ministry of Railways to hold an on-site meeting in Chengdu to exchange experiences. In order to welcome the on-site technical revolution meeting to be held in Guiyang in March and the convening of the National Conference of Advanced Representatives of Technological Innovation in the future, it immediately mobilized all employees of the institute to launch a technical revolution movement of "Five Great Campaigns" starting in March, and to concentrate its forces to break through all the key and cutting-edge topics that have been scheduled for the whole year before "July 1st". All employees of the institute are now advancing victoriously with one heart and mind in a galloping manner. This is the concrete application and practice of the principle of combining the "theory of continuous revolution" and the "theory of stages of revolutionary development" in the technical revolution movement of our institute, and it also proves the unparalleled strong vitality of this principle.

**Focus on Breaking Through Key Production Points**

Technological innovation and technological revolution serve production, so we must focus on breaking through key production points. At the beginning of the movement, we guided the masses to open fire on unreasonable rules and regulations, then to reasonably simplify design procedures and design drawings, and then to further liberate designers from tedious calculations and liberate exploration personnel from heavy physical labor. This is based on the different situations at each stage, different key issues are put forward, and forces are concentrated to break through them. Now we have basically achieved "comprehensive standardization of design", "typesetting and assembly of drawing," "charting, scaling, and instrumentation of calculation," and "lightening and automation of exploration equipment." In the past two years, the number of standardized design projects completed is equivalent to 6.2 times the total in previous years before the Great Leap Forward, and the utilization rate has increased to 90%. Curve tables are emerging in an endless stream. The recent "Quick Design Table for Small Bridges and Culverts" increased work efficiency by three times, solving the difficulty of tight tasks and insufficient manpower at that time; the coefficient interpolation method was used to calculate the operating cost of double-track lines, increasing work efficiency by ten times. In the calculation of rulers and calculation disks, the indigenous method was first used, and more than 50 types were self-made and put into production, increasing work efficiency by five to fifty times, and the cost was only one-tenth of that of factory-made ones. The weight of the 59-type drilling machine was reduced by 600 kilograms, the double-acting lever pump eliminated the bulky air compressor, and the gear pump was small and exquisite, and was well received by the field exploration team.

It is precisely because the key production points are grasped at each stage, once the problem is solved, production is improved, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, which makes it easy to put forward higher requirements. In this way, "break through key points, innovate, then break through key points again, and then innovate again," driving production to leap forward wave after wave.

Now we are further developing towards the content of innovation, and moving towards the four modernizations of railways, two lines, high, large, precise, advanced, new technologies and new products. Design calculations have reached the point where there are as many as 37 types of electrification, mechanization, and single-point simulation; we are studying how to apply new technologies to exploration, the design and mechanized construction of long tunnels and high and large bridges, and the full automation of station equipment. This shows that the development of the movement has gone beyond the scope of surveying and design methods and entered the field of content innovation, playing a role in promoting the four modernizations of railways. We are now sending people to learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal design institutes in production organization and management, striving to realize the automatic production line and continuous production line of design work before "July 1st," and then double the labor productivity, so that the relations of production adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces.

**We Must Implement the Policy of Walking on Two Legs**

In the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, we must implement the policy of walking on two legs. First of all: "Combining foreign and indigenous methods, combining large, medium and small." Foreign is the development of indigenous, and large is the future of small. Therefore, we must never neglect "small indigenous" and unilaterally pursue "large foreign," but must be "foreign if possible, indigenous if not." Nor can it be understood that "indigenous" is backward and "foreign" is good. There is only one standard for measurement, that is: it is good to be able to meet the requirements of the General Line for more, faster, better and more economical. The railway transportation in our country cannot meet the needs of the development of the national economy, and the broad masses of the working people overcame various difficulties and relied on their own efforts to build more than 6,000 kilometers of "small indigenous" railways in 1959, solving the difficulties of short-distance transportation and liberating a large number of labor forces. It is fast and economical, and adapts to the needs of transportation development. Can we say that "small indigenous" is not good? We say: "Very good." And we must vigorously develop it.

In the past two years, "combining foreign and indigenous methods, combining large, medium and small" has also shone brightly in our institute. In design and calculation, there are both indigenous methods of rulers, charts, and curve charting, as well as electrical mechanization; adobe load-bearing walls, using naturally graded gravel materials from the Gobi Desert to prefabricate hollow bricks, and frameless brick lamellar shell building designs, replacing or reducing the amount of steel, cement, and wood used; using indigenous "Qanat" water diversion instead of "foreign" water pipes, saving cement and steel; the application of cone exploration, digging exploration, and Luoyang shovel combined with electrical exploration greatly reduced the amount of drilling work, and so on.

This all shows that indigenous methods have strong vitality and can solve key problems in production, and because indigenous methods are simple and easy to implement, they can quickly play a role in production. Therefore, in order to push the innovation movement to a new climax, we must continue to break the superstition of emphasizing foreign and devaluing indigenous, emphasizing large and devaluing small, and vigorously engage in combining foreign and indigenous methods, and combining large, medium and small.

Secondly: combining innovative creation with summary and promotion. The purpose of innovative creation is mainly to improve labor productivity and develop production, and the effect will naturally be greater if it can blossom everywhere. Therefore, we must never innovate for the sake of innovation, and must achieve the effect of promotion through the means of summary and exchange. Promotion is also a process of consolidation and improvement; innovating one item and promoting one item will not only consolidate the innovation project, but also consolidate the high enthusiasm of the masses. We must never finish an activity with a gust of wind. In the promotion, we must also promote with innovation, so as to improve step by step and continuously develop innovative creation; promoting without innovation is a manifestation of lazy thinking and must be opposed.

In the promotion, we must also "coordinate experiences," which is itself one of the methods of improvement. We must be good at integrating single experiences and coordinating them to form a complete set, so that advanced experiences can exert greater power. Our institute acquired 159 advanced experiences at the Chengdu meeting, promoted 114 items three days later, and organized coordination work. For example, after coordinating the relevant nomographs for bridge curve layout, work efficiency increased by 13 times, increasing the comprehensive work efficiency of large and medium-sized bridge design by 35%. At the same time, more than 10 kinds of tools were created in the coordination process, increasing work efficiency by 5 to 10 times. Therefore, coordination is also a process of re-innovation, which concretely embodies the spirit of continuous revolution.

The practice of implementing the policy of walking on two legs in the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has once again irrefutably proved that "Mao Zedong's banner is invincible."

**Large-Scale Collaboration, Internal and External Integration, One-Stop Service**

Engaging in large-scale collaboration, internal and external integration, and one-stop service is a good experience gradually explored during the Great Leap Forward. It is one of the important measures to push the movement to a new climax, an important method to promote the high-speed development of production, and also an embodiment of communist style and socialist relations of production. Railway surveying and design involve many types of work and a wide range of areas, so it is of great significance for all aspects to do a good job in collaboration and mutual support. For example, there are six types of work and ten specialties in station design. After forming a "six-in-one" joint office, implementing unified leadership, and forming a "one-stop" large-scale collaboration, not only has work efficiency increased by three to five times, but more importantly, they understand each other's situations, and designers jump out of their small circles and can proceed from the overall situation. Ideological style has improved, and the phenomenon of buck-passing has disappeared. The completion of the 59-type drilling machine is not only a collaboration between several units of the design institute, but also the assistance of several factories in Lanzhou and Baoji. A locomotive engineer once carried his luggage to the Lanxi Locomotive Depot, eating, living and working with the workers, and soliciting more than 100 suggestions, which played a good role in improving the design. The "three combinations" blossomed brightly here. In the design of adobe load-bearing walls and Qanat water diversion tunnels, the design personnel visited and consulted with old farmers many times, and the design drawings compiled were both practical, fast and economical. Some engineers said with emotion: "Sitting in the office, you see and hear less, there are treasures everywhere, it depends on whether you find them or not." This is the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the combination of technical personnel and the masses, and the large-scale collaboration of internal and external integration. We carried out exploration to support the Yin Tao Project, and carried out the design of diverting water up the mountains to support drought resistance. Once, in order to rescue the vegetables of the Yantan People's Commune from frost damage, we stopped working for half a day and sent people and cars to support them, in exchange for the initiative of neighboring units to provide us with the information we needed and many aspects of life convenience. This not only strengthened internal and external cooperative relations, but also consolidated the worker-peasant alliance.

In addition, we have also linked up with more than 120 bureaus, colleges, scientific research institutions, and enterprise organs across the country in terms of scientific and technological information, sharing information with each other in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. For some key innovations that are still to be broken through in railway construction and operation, we have also further proactively solicited their opinions in order to negotiate and jointly organize forces to break through them as soon as possible.

After summarizing the above experiences, we have proposed ten "one-stop" large-scale collaborations based on production, and implemented them throughout the institute as a work system.

**Take Advantage of the East Wind and Unfold Grand Plans, Continue to Move Forward**

Representatives, under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement of our institute has continued to grow and develop in the past two years, promoting the high-speed development of production. The development of the movement is normal and healthy. However, it is still basically in the exploratory stage, and some shortcomings of uneven development are being quickly overcome. All employees of the institute are now full of confidence and are vigorously fighting the "Second Campaign".

In short, the current excellent situation of the movement is the same as in all parts of the country: the leadership is determined, the masses are enthusiastic, the political momentum is great, the scale of the movement is large, and the economic effect is great. We also have the rich experience of continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, the strong leadership of the Party, and the fiery hearts of the masses. We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought under the brilliant light of the General Line, take advantage of the East Wind and unfold grand plans, continue to liberate our minds, continue to carry forward the communist style of combining daring to think and act with scientific analysis, conscientiously study and master Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from advanced experiences, and continuously reform the relations of production to adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces, resolutely unite with the masses, bravely innovate and create, become pioneers in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and push the movement from one climax to a higher climax, striving to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest and achieve a more, faster, better and more economical sustainable great leap forward in 1960.

    铁路设计工作大闹技术革新
    雷从民代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和谭震林副总理“关于提前实现农业发展纲要的报告”，并坚决为其实现而努力。
    高效率利用现有线路，高速度建设新线
    在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民继1958年大跃进的胜利，更加鼓足了革命干劲发挥了无穷智慧，使社会主义建设以巨人的步伐向前发展，胜利地超额完成了1959年国民经济计划。这是党的领导和毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的胜利，是坚持政治挂帅大搞群众运动的胜利。
    在1958年和1959年连续获得伟大跃进胜利的基础上，全国人民继续贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线，以更大的干劲努力实现1960年更新更大的跃进任务。
    在铁路运输事业方面，为保证实现社会主义全面跃进任务，必须努力完成和超额完成国家计划规定的货运量七亿二千万吨，新建铁路八千三百八十九公里，改建铁路四百二十一公里等艰巨而光荣的任务。为着实现这一跃进指标，要求我们必须：高效率地运用铁路，充分发挥现有设备潜力；高速、优质、低成本地完成新线基本建设。并进一步地立雄心展宏图，向铁路四化（机械化，自动化，电气化，内燃化）两线（生产自动线，生产连续线）和高、大、精、尖、新全面进军，攀登科学高峰，尽快地建成一个用现代化最新技术装备的四通八达的铁路网。经验证明：只要我们坚决在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线，大跃进，坚持群众路线，大闹技术革新、技术革命，充分发挥我们的主观能动性，就一定能够顺利地完成我们的光荣任务，更好地满足社会主义建设高速度发展的需要。
    为了加速我国社会主义建设事业的发展，铁路员工，同各个生产战线上的劳动人民一样，在大跃进的同时，开展了波澜壮阔的群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经获得了辉煌的成就。我现在仅就铁道部第一设计院在进行这一群众运动中的几点体会汇报于下，不妥之处请各位代表批评指正。
    两年来我们第一设计院全体职工，在党委直接领导下，坚决反透右倾，鼓起更大的革命干劲，大闹技术革新和技术革命，在精神面貌上起了很大的变化。群众思想大大解放，敢想敢为的共产主义风格大为发扬，破除了设计工作不能大搞群众运动不能高速度发展的迷信，废除或修改了二千零三十一条束缚生产力发展的陈规旧章，制订了适合于生产跃进的工作方法和工作制度。生产关系有了很大的改进，生产力得到解放，扯皮现象变为密切协作关系。全院职工共提出合理化建议八十万零八千五百一十九件，采纳率达43％，其中的六十二项已在全路推行，推广先进经验一千二百六十项，改进和试制新产品一百六十多项，完成科学技术研究七百三十六项，总结生产技术经验一百七十四项，推动了生产持续跃进，保证了任务的顺利完成。特别在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，彻底粉碎了一小部分右倾机会主义分子向党猖狂进攻的阴谋之后，我院又出现了一个
  “万众一心、万马奔腾、万紫千红、万象更新”的新局面，继提前四十四天跨进1960年之后又赢得了1960年“开门红”，获得思想生产双丰收。现在我院又已开展了一个轰轰烈烈以高速优质为纲、以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，并在本年3月份开始了“五大战役”中第一个战役，决心要把技术革新和技术革命推向更大更新的高潮。我们相信，在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，我们一定能够获得更大更新的胜利。
    是技术革命运动，也是思想革命运动
    实践证明，要革新技术，必须先革思想的命。两年来我院的技术革命过程也是与各种右倾保守思想斗争的过程，是不断破除迷信解放思想的过程。1958年以前，在铁路设计工作过程中有一种叫作“五大落后”的现象，也就是说，铁路修好了而运输上所需要的站场、机务、给水、房屋建筑、信号等设备的设计图纸尚不能全部交付施工。大跃进形势逼人，摆在设计人员面前的问题是力争上游作大跃进的急先锋呢？还是安于落后当施工运营部门的绊脚石呢？回答当然是前者。当时有人提出站场设计综合定型化的建议，但遭到一部分人的反对。他们说：“站场设计牵涉五六个工种，动一付道岔就会影响全局，太复杂不能定型，要搞也得指定几个专家搞一两年才行”。党支部及时地组织群众鸣放辩论，共青团员们找到了咽喉设计是关键，随后立即掀起了一个群众搞站场定型设计运动，从二十多个方案中综合提炼最后确定了最好的方案，只用八天的时间办完了原来认为一两年才行的事情，根本上扭转了“五大落后”。给右倾保守唯条件论者当头一棒！又如在搞牵引变电所定型设计中，也有人说，
  “目前的设计已经过改革，仅要十至十三天已够快的了，油水不大，技术复杂，定不了型。”这是安于现状缺乏革命热诚的右倾情绪。党支部针对这一“技革到顶”的错误思想，组织群众学习不断革命论的理论并展开辩论，结果将设计解剖成十部分，分组突击如何定型的问题，最后进行技术表演会，用拼装设计，只二十八分钟就解决了问题，提高工效一百六十倍。“技革到顶”、“油水不大”论者终于认输了。另外有一部分人对技革与生产的关系认识不清，把技革与生产对立起来，认为人手少搞了生产搞不了技革，生产一忙就把技革放在一旁，而没有认识到技革才是促进生产最有效的途径。通过群众大闹技革的实际事例教育了这一部分人，使他们也积极地参加到技术革新和技术革命运动的热潮中。
    通过大闹技术革新和技术革命运动的实际教育，紧密地结合了毛泽东思想的学习，全院职工的政治思想觉悟也大大地提高，共产主义协作之风大兴，原来以扯皮著名的一个枢纽总体现在已被群众称为“协作专家”了。学习毛主席著作已成为群众自觉的要求，把学习毛泽东思想当作解决困难的钥匙，形成了一个空前未有的学习高潮。全院的精神面貌又转入一个新的阶段，促进了生产的不断跃进。充分证明了“要革自然的命必须先革思想的命”这一真理。
    造声势鼓干劲　抓时机掀高潮
    造声势鼓干劲，不断激励群众情绪，是大闹技术革新技术革命运动的必要条件。抓时机掀高潮根据形势提出新的战斗口号是运动不断前进的必要动力。不依靠群众，技革同样也搞不成功，不充分发挥主观能动性，运动也不会持久。因此在运动一开始就必须是轰轰烈烈，而不是冷冷清清的，大搞宣传活动，反复动员，交清形势，指出方向，提出战斗口号，轰开局面。事实上在群众发动起来以后，群众自己就创造出不少生动活泼的宣传形式，如广播大会、报捷会、生产运动会、技术表演会、打擂比武会等等，墙上也是绘画结采，各种图表内容千秋，真是万紫千红，万象更新，锣鼓喧天地好像天天办喜事一般，有力地推动了运动的开展。局面轰开之后，就组织群众性的“学、赶、超、帮”插红旗、树标兵的竞赛运动。不断培养标兵，使先进者更先进，在运动中起到“龙头”作用，以此来推动运动不断向前发展，并要求标兵见后进就帮，要送宝上门，使后进也达到先进的水平，共同跃进。在竞赛中，群众也创造了近六十多种丰富多采生动活泼的竞赛形式：如标兵赛、对手赛、对口赛、列车挂钩赛，大战役、小战役、三帮（先进帮后进，熟手帮生手、快手帮慢手）、四找（找对手能者为师，找原因追根到底，找经验虚心学习，找差距分毫必争）等等。正副处长之间，院正副总工程师之间都展开了互比赛，形成处处赛、人人赛、事事赛的局面，并通过检查评比，不断前进。这样在全院三千多名职工中涌现出红旗手一百六十名，标兵二百三十九名，省级和铁道部先进集体的代表三十七名，院级先进集体的代表二百四十五名。参加对手赛的一千一百四十七对，对口赛的二百二十五对。在运动中要随时注意周围形势的变化，注意新事物的苗头，抓紧时机，掀起新高潮，提出新的战斗口号。这样才能防止群众的松劲情绪，不断鼓足干劲，经常保持旺盛的斗志和充沛的革命热情，使运动不断深入发展，一浪高一浪地前进。我院在今年2月间抓住铁道部召开成都交流经验现场会议的时机，为迎接3月份在贵阳召开的技术革命现场会议和将来的全国技革先进代表者大会的召开，立即动员全院职工从3月份开始展开“五大战役”的技术革命运动，并且要集中力量把全年已经排上项目的关键和尖端课题在“七一”前全部突破。全院职工现正是万众一心以万马奔腾之势乘胜前进。这是“不断革命论”和“革命发展阶段论”相结合的原则在我院技术革命运动中的具体运用与实践，也证明了这一原则无比强大的生命力。
    围绕生产关键重点突破
    技术革新和技术革命是为生产服务，因此就必须围绕生产关键重点突破。在运动一开始，我们是引导群众向不合理的规章制度开火，随后是合理简化设计程序和设计图纸，再进一步是把设计人员从繁琐的计算中解放出来，把勘探人员从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。这是根据每一阶段的不同情况提出了不同的关键问题，集中力量予以突破。现在我们已基本上达到“设计综合定型化”，“制图活版拼装化”，“计算图表化、尺子化、仪器化”，“勘探机具轻装化，自动化”。两年来完成定型设计项目相当于大跃进前历年总和的六点二倍，利用率提高到90％。曲线表格层出不穷，最近的“小桥涵快速设计表”提高工率三倍，解决了当时任务紧人手不足的困难；复线运营费计算采用了系数内插法提高工率十倍。计算尺子和计算盘，土法先上马，自制了五十多种投入生产，提高工率五倍至五十倍，成本只是厂制的十分之一弱。59型钻机重量减轻六百公斤，双作用拉杆水泵省去了笨重的空压机，齿轮水泵小巧玲珑，深受外业勘探队的欢迎。
    正由于在每一阶段抓住了生产关键，问题一得到解决，生产提高了，群众情绪就很高，这就便于提出更高的要求。这样破“关键，革新，再破关键，再革新”，一浪高一浪地推动生产向前飞跃发展。
    现在我们更进一步地向革新内容方面发展，向铁路四化，两线，高、大、精、尖、新技术新产品迈进。设计计算达到电气化、机械化、单电模拟已有三十七种之多；正在研究如何把新技术运用到勘探方面的问题，长隧道、高大桥梁的设计和机械化施工的问题，以及站场设备全部自动化的问题。说明运动的发展已超越勘测设计方法的范围，进入革新内容的领域，对铁路四化起到促进作用。我们现在正派人学习各兄弟设计院生产组织管理方面的先进经验，争取在“七一”前实现设计工作的生产自动线和生产连续线，进而再成倍地提高劳动生产率，使生产关系适应生产力发展的需要。
    必须贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针。首先是：“洋土并举，大中小相结合”。洋是土的发展，大是小的未来。因此决不能忽视“小土”，片面追求“大洋”，而必须是“能洋则洋，不能洋则土。”也决不能理解为“土”就是落后，“洋”就是好。衡量的标准只有一个，那就是：能符合总路线多快好省的要求就好。我国的铁路运输满足不了国民经济发展的需要，而广大的劳动人民战胜了各种困难自力更生在1959年修了六千余公里的“小土”铁路，解决了短途运输的困难，解放了大批劳动力。又快又省，适应了运输发展的需要。这能说“小土”不好吗？我们说：“好得很。”并且要大力发展。
    两年来“洋土并举，大中小相结合”在我院也大放光芒。在设计计算中既有土法尺子、图表曲线化，也搞电气机械化；土坯承重墙，利用戈壁滩天然级配卵石材料预制空心砌砖，无筋砖扁壳的房屋设计，代替了或减少了钢材、水泥、木料的用量；利用土法“坎儿井”导水代替了“洋”水管，又节约了水泥和钢材；锥探、挖探、洛阳铲的应用配合电法勘探大大地减少了钻探工作量等等。
    这都说明：土法有强大的生命力，能解决生产上的关键问题，而由于土法简而易行，就能立竿见影在生产上迅速发挥作用。因此为了把革新运动推向新的高潮，我们仍要继续破除重洋轻土重大轻小的迷信，大搞洋土并举，大中小相结合。
    其次是：革新创造与总结推广相结合。革新创造的目的主要是提高劳动生产率发展生产，要能遍地开花，效果自然更大。因此决不能为革新而革新，必须经过总结交流的手段达到推广的效果。推广又是巩固和提高的过程；革新一件就推广一件，这不但会把革新项目巩固起来，也会巩固群众的高涨情绪，决不能一个运动一股风过去就完了。在推广中也必须是推而有创，才能步步提高，使革新创造不断发展；推而不创是懒汉思想的表现，要反对。
    在推广中还要“经验配套”，这本身也是提高方法之一。要善于把单项经验综合起来配套成龙，使先进经验发挥更大的威力。我院在成都会议上取得了一百五十九项先进经验，三天后推广了一百一十四项，并组织了配套工作。如桥梁曲线布置将有关诺模图配套之后工率就提高了十三倍，使大中桥设计综合工率提高35％。同时在配套过程中又创造了十多种工具，提高工率五至十倍。因此说，配套也是再革新的过程，它具体地体现了不断革命的精神。
    在技术革新技术革命运动中贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针的实践，又一次无可辩驳地证明了“毛泽东的思想旗帜是无往而不胜”。
    大协作内外结合一条龙
    大搞协作，内外结合一条龙，是大跃进中逐步摸索到的好经验，它是把运动推向新高潮的重要措施之一，是促进生产高速度发展的重要方法，同时也是共产主义风格和社会主义生产关系的体现。铁路勘测设计工种多牵涉面广，因此各方面搞好协作互相支援，更有其重大的意义。如在站场设计中有六个工种十个专业，经过组成“六合一”联合办公室，实行统一领导，组成“一条龙”大协作之后，不仅工率提高三至五倍，更重要的是彼此之间互相了解情况，设计人员跳出自己的小圈子，能从整体出发，思想风格提高了，扯皮现象没有了。59型钻机的制成，不仅是设计院几个单位间的协作而且有兰州宝鸡市几个工厂的协助。一个机务工程师曾背上行李卷到兰西机务段同工人同志同吃同住同劳动，征求到一百多条建议，对改善设计起了良好的作用。“三结合”在这里开了鲜艳的花朵。在土坯承重墙、坎儿井导水坑道的设计中，设计人员向老农民多次访问请教后编制的设计图既切实际，又快又省。有的工程师感慨地说：“坐在办公室，见闻就是少，到处都有宝，看你找不找”。这是土洋结合，是技术人员与群众相结合，是大搞协作内外结合。我们为支援引洮工程进行了勘探，为支援抗旱进行了引水上山的设计，也有一次为了抢救雁滩人民公社的蔬菜免受霜冻危害，曾停止半天工作，派人派汽车去支援，换来的是友邻单位主动地提供我们所需要的资料和多方面生活上的便利条件。这不但是密切了内外协作关系，也巩固了工农联盟。
    此外我们在科技情报方面也已与全国各地一百二十多个局院校科研机构企业机关挂上钩，互通有无，以期事半功倍。对于在铁路施工运营中尚待突破的一些革新关键，也已进一步主动地征求他们的意见，以利协商共同组织力量早日予以突破。
    我们在总结了以上这些经验之后，已针对生产提出了十项“一条龙”大协作，并且作为一项工作制度在全院贯彻执行。
    乘东风　展宏图，继续前进
    各位代表，两年来我院的技术革新、技术革命运动在党委的直接领导下，不断地成长壮大，推进了生产高速度发展，运动的发展是正常的健康的。但基本上还是在摸索阶段，还有发展不够平衡的一些缺点正在迅速加以克服。全院职工现正信心百倍，热火朝天地大战“第二战役”。
    总之，当前运动的大好形势同全国各地一样：领导决心大，群众干劲足，政治声势大，运动规模大，经济效果大。我们又有1958年1959年连续大跃进的丰富经验，有党的坚强领导，有群众一片火热的心，一定要在总路线的光辉照耀下高举毛泽东思想红旗，乘东风展宏图，继续解放思想，继续发扬敢想敢为和科学分析相结合的共产主义风尚，认真地学习并掌握毛泽东思想，虚心学习先进经验，不断地改革生产关系以适应生产力发展的需要，坚决与群众打成一片，勇敢地革新创造，成为技术革新、技术革命运动中的闯将，把运动从一个高潮推向更高的高潮，为获得全面大丰收，实现1960年更多更快更好更省地持续大跃进而努力奋斗。
