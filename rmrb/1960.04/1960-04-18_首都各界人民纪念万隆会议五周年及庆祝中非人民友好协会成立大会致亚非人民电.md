Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Message to the Asian and African People from the "Commemoration of the Fifth Anniversary of the Bandung Conference and the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Held by People from All Walks of Life in the Capital"

The "Commemoration of the Fifth Anniversary of the Bandung Conference and the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association," initiated by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, was solemnly held in Beijing today. The conference extends its highest respect and warm greetings to the Asian and African people who are striving for and safeguarding national independence and defending world peace.

The Bandung Conference held five years ago was an event of great historical significance. Encouraged by the Bandung spirit, the national independence movement in Asia and Africa has flourished, deepened step by step, and won victory after victory. The Asian people have repeatedly defeated the armed aggression and subversion activities of imperialism headed by the United States, and the national democratic movement has developed more profoundly forward. The Japanese people are waging a heroic struggle against the US-Japan Security Treaty and against the revival of Japanese militarism. The face of the African continent is undergoing tremendous changes, with anti-colonial flames burning everywhere, and a series of countries have successively declared independence. The Algerian people's armed struggle against the French colonialists is growing stronger and stronger. The Cameroonian people are stubbornly adhering to the struggle for the withdrawal of French aggressor troops and for the complete independence of their motherland. The struggle of the Congolese people is impacting the Belgian colonial rule. The struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination and for basic human rights is developing turbulently. The friendly unity formed by the people of Asian and African countries in the just struggle for striving for and safeguarding national independence and defending world peace is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. The Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are being increasingly promoted.

After suffering a serious defeat, imperialism headed by the United States is carrying out a dying struggle. On the one hand, they are stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, expanding military bases, piecing together military blocs, and reviving West German and Japanese militarism in Asia and Africa, and are brutally suppressing national revolutionary struggles. On the other hand, they are playing various deceptive tricks, trying every possible means to disintegrate the unity of the Asian and African people and undermine the national democratic movement of the Asian and African people. However, any conspiracy of imperialism is doomed to failure. The current situation is very favorable. The awakened Asian and African people, as long as they strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and persist in struggle, will surely be able to win the final victory.

The Chinese people have always unswervingly followed the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are determined to fight together with the Asian and African people for the common cause of opposing imperialism, colonialism, and defending world peace. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and resolutely supported the struggle of the African people to strive for and safeguard national independence.

On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association was officially established in Beijing on April 12. The establishment of the association marks a further development of the friendly relations between the Chinese and African people. The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association will make unremitting efforts to promote the friendly unity and cultural and economic exchanges between the Chinese and African people.

Long live the victory of the Bandung spirit!
Long live the struggle of the Asian and African people to strive for and safeguard national independence!
Long live the unity of the Asian and African people!
Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and African people!
Long live world peace!

    首都各界人民纪念万隆会议五周年及庆祝中非人民友好协会成立大会致亚非人民电
    新华社17日讯　“首都各界人民纪念万隆会议五周年及庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会成立大会”致亚非人民的通电
    由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民对外文化协会和中国非洲人民友好协会发起召开的“首都各界人民纪念万隆会议五周年及庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会成立大会”，今天在北京隆重举行。大会向争取和维护民族独立保卫世界和平的亚非人民，致以崇高的敬意和热情的问候。
    五年前所举行的万隆会议是一个具有伟大历史意义的事件。在万隆精神的鼓舞下，亚非地区的民族独立运动蓬勃发展，步步深入，节节胜利。亚洲人民一次又一次地击败了以美国为首的帝国主义的武装侵略和颠覆活动，民族民主运动更加深入地向前发展。日本人民正在为反对美日安全条约，反对日本军国主义的复活进行着英勇的斗争。非洲大陆的面貌正在发生巨大的变化，反殖民主义的烽火遍地燃烧，一系列国家相继宣布独立。阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民者的武装斗争越战越强。喀麦隆人民顽强地坚持着要求撤退法国侵略军和为实现祖国完全独立的斗争。刚果人民的斗争冲击着比利时的殖民统治。南非人民反对种族歧视争取基本人权的斗争，正在汹涌澎湃地发展。亚非各国人民在争取和维护民族独立、保卫世界和平的正义斗争中形成的友好团结日益巩固和发展。万隆精神和和平共处五项原则正在越来越发扬光大。
    以美国为首的帝国主义遭到严重失败之后，正在进行垂死的挣扎。他们一方面在亚非地区加紧扩军备战、扩建军事基地、拼凑军事集团，复活西德和日本军国主义，并且野蛮地镇压民族革命斗争，一方面玩弄各种欺骗伎俩，千方百计地企图瓦解亚非人民的团结，破坏亚非人民的民族民主运动。但是，帝国主义的任何阴谋都是注定要失败的。目前形势十分有利，觉醒了的亚非人民，只要加强团结，提高警惕，坚持斗争，就一定能够赢得最后胜利。
    中国人民始终不渝地遵循万隆精神和和平共处五项原则，坚决地同亚非人民一起，为反对帝国主义、殖民主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业而奋斗。中国人民一向同情和坚决支持非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    在纪念万隆会议五周年的前夕，中国非洲人民友好协会已于4月12日正式在北京成立。协会的成立，标志着中国和非洲人民之间的友好关系的进一步发展。中国非洲人民友好协会将为促进中国和非洲人民的友好团结和文化、经济交流进行不懈的努力。
    万隆精神胜利万岁！
    亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争胜利万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    中国非洲人民友好团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
