Comrades Chairman and Representatives,

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. From these reports, we can clearly see the tremendous achievements and rich experiences that the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have gained in developing our socialist construction cause in 1959. We also see the magnificent plans for the national economy in 1960, based on this foundation, and the bright and splendid prospects that lie before the people of the whole country. I assure the Party and Chairman Mao that we will resolutely implement the various guidelines, policies, and tasks proposed in the reports, and guarantee to better and more comprehensively overfulfill the coal production plan assigned to us by the state this year.

**Shandong's Coal Industry Achieved Double Leap Forward in Coal Mining and Tunneling in 1959**

In the past two years, Shandong's coal industry, like other regions across the country, has achieved brilliant victories in a continuous great leap forward under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. Coal production in 1958 increased by 121% compared to 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 67.8% compared to the great leap forward year of 1958. In terms of capital construction, investment completed in 1958 increased by more than 64% compared to 1957, and in 1959 it increased by more than 41% compared to 1958. Our Hongshan Coal Mine, like all brother coal mines across the country and the province, under the inspiration of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, resolutely implemented the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. In 1958, coal production increased by 46.8% compared to 1957, and the progress of main roadway tunneling increased by 53.8% compared to 1957. In 1959, we thoroughly carried out the high-yield red flag competition movement centered on technological revolution, launching a production upsurge of all-round great leap forward. We overfulfilled the state coal production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, with an annual output increase of 29% compared to 1958, and the progress of main roadway tunneling increased nearly doubled compared to 1958. Other tasks also achieved great successes, realizing an all-round success for the entire year.

**Innovation Projects Emerged in an Endless Stream This Year**

Especially since the beginning of 1960, in accordance with the requirements put forward by higher authorities to take large-scale high yield as the key link, vigorously carry out five major revolutions (mining and tunneling methods, liberation of heavy manual labor, accelerating recovery and tunneling progress, simplifying production processes, using less or no pit props), and fiercely attack high, precise, and advanced technologies, the broad masses of workers, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, and developing the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, put forward the heroic slogan of "We must learn what others have, we must create what others don't have, work hard and skillfully to achieve the four modernizations and one without mines (the four modernizations are coal mining mechanization, drilling electrification, transportation mechanization, and canteen gasification; one without means no pit props), and climb the peak of science and technology with an indomitable spirit." A technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic, and semi-hydraulic as the content was quickly launched. A new atmosphere of innovation prevailing and helping each other emerged throughout the mine. The workers of the ventilation zone successfully tested the physical and chemical ventilation method, eliminating about 90% of the harmful carbon dioxide gas. The repair group successfully tested electric spring coiling, increasing efficiency by more than twenty times. As of the end of March, the workers of the entire mine, focusing on the key to production, put forward more than 25,000 rationalization proposals and implemented more than 11,000 of them. Forty-seven major innovation projects have been realized. The degree of mechanization in all types of work, from coal mining to washing and selection, from production to life, has increased significantly. At the same time, nearly half of the mining and tunneling faces have used substitutes for pit props, reaching the standard of no pit props, saving the country a large amount of useful building timber. Two coal washing plants have achieved centralized operation and remote control automation, a high-level production technology, and nine out of ten canteens have achieved gasification. This has improved efficiency, reduced costs, and greatly improved the working conditions of the workers. Taking the promotion of the Xinwen Bureau's 60 electric drill as an example, it not only saves large equipment such as air compressors and seamless steel pipes and electricity, reduces coal and rock dust, but also increases drilling efficiency by one to four times. Workers praised: "The 60 drill is really good, the equipment is small, the efficiency is high, drilling does not eat coal and rock dust, pneumoconiosis is eliminated, and the tunneling workers are all smiles, thanking the Party's good leadership." Through technological revolution, more than 500 workers in the mine have been liberated from heavy manual labor, 900 workers have been drawn to engage in sideline production and waterproofing, and 700 workers have been transferred to support new coal mine units and agricultural construction. By March of this year, the degree of mechanization calculated by person in the mine has increased from 23% at the end of 1959 to 36%, so that the production in the first quarter of 1960, on the basis of winning the opening red, has won monthly red first quarter full red victory, completed the national coal production plan nine and a half days ahead of schedule, completed the tunneling main roadway progress plan seven and a half days ahead of schedule, and the average daily output increased by 11% compared to 1959, achieving increased production and reduced staff.

**In order to realize coal mining without pit props, every mine has a plan, every district has measures, everyone has determination, and everyone writes a guarantee**

Currently, the workers of the entire mine are confidently and energetically continuing to advance bravely to complete and overfulfill the leap forward plan for the whole year.
First, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide and adhere to putting politics in command

The process of technological revolution is first of all a process of ideological revolution. In the technological revolution movement, we organized the broad masses of workers to actively study Mao Zedong's works, to arm the minds of the workers with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the primary guarantee for our achievements. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee last year, the vast majority of workers have shown a higher communist consciousness, boldly creating and working hard, but there are still a few cadres who still have some right-leaning conservative ideas. For example, when the Xinwen 60 electric drill was first promoted, some grassroots cadres reflected that "Xinwen is all coal, with a lot of tunneling, and we are half coal and rock, purely drilling hard rocks, and it cannot be promoted at all." By organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works and carrying out discussions, the broad masses of cadres and workers raised their consciousness, further emancipated their minds, and went all out. After repeated research and experiments, they finally succeeded, and the efficiency of drilling stone eyes was one times higher than that of pneumatic drills, powerfully refuting the "condition theory" and enabling the rapid promotion of the 60 electric drill. The broad masses of workers deeply realized in their study that Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp weapon for us to build socialism. As long as we master Mao Zedong Thought, there are no fallacies that cannot be refuted and no difficulties that cannot be overcome. They said, "Chairman Mao's works must be studied well, every word and sentence must be remembered, work and study cannot be separated from it, and communism will come early." "Chairman Mao's works are a magic weapon, everyone must study it, if you master this weapon, no matter how big the difficulties can be overcome, I used to be inferior and afraid to learn, but now the more I learn, the higher my energy becomes." Through study, the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, and they have generally listened to the Party's words, strengthened their determination to take the socialist road, and firmly established the idea of an all-round leap forward, thus showing a lively political situation in which energy is boosted again and again, upstream is fought for again and again, work does not count time and conditions, labor does not count rewards, forgetting self for the public, and everything is for the realization of the leap forward plan. In short, strengthening the Party's leadership and adhering to putting politics in command is the only important guarantee for the victory of all work.

Second, make plans at all levels and carry out competition activities

On the basis of improving the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers, mobilize the masses from top to bottom to formulate plans at all levels and clarify the main attack direction. Through the method of four determinations (determine the project, determine the time, determine the measures, and determine the personnel), the plan is quickly implemented to the masses, mobilizing the masses to formulate competition guarantee conditions around the plan and the key to on-site production of this unit, and carry out study, comparison, catch-up, and help competition. All wells, factories, teams, and groups in the mine have formulated guarantee conditions with different focuses and different contents according to their specific circumstances, so that every well and every team has a goal, and every group and every person has a direction. In the competition, the broad masses of workers developed the communist labor spirit, and new people and new things emerged endlessly. For example, the workers of the No. 2 well used the small five elements to the small six elements of the coal chute to change it into a small coal storage warehouse, which effectively guaranteed balanced production. The workers of the 52nd team of the No. 1 well successfully trial-produced a double air drill frame, which doubled efficiency, and so on.

Third, overall planning, key breakthroughs

In the movement, we seize the main links, concentrate superior forces, and carry out assaults in batches and in stages to ensure realization. In arranging the innovation plan, we arrange several major innovation projects that need to be tested according to the needs and possibilities of the production of each well, so that each unit has a different focus. From the perspective of the well, this is because the key points are prominent and easy to grasp and realize. From the perspective of the mine, several major innovation projects have pilot projects and are tested comprehensively. In this way, we have achieved twice the result with half the effort and effectively guaranteed the realization of the innovation plan.

Fourth, give play to the role of three combinations

From the mine to the team, technical innovation committees and research groups with the participation of leading cadres, workers, and technicians have been established. Every time a new innovation is carried out, special forces are organized to take full responsibility. They hold "Zhuge Liang meetings" every day to analyze problems, study measures, and constantly put forward topics, mobilize the masses to make suggestions, gather ideas, and encircle the key. In promoting the 60 electric drill, the innovation committee of the No. 2 well focused on the key drill bit, studied measures, mobilized tunneling workers, and everyone made mud models, learning from each other's strengths to overcome the drill bit barrier, thus improving the drill bit and increasing drilling efficiency by about 15%. This is the main method for us to constantly overcome technical barriers.

Fifth, combine indigenous and foreign methods

In the movement, we earnestly implemented the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and "walking on two legs." The workers of the No. 6 well, in order to realize the basket car, used the windlass instead of the small winch. The Hongshan No. 3 well, in order to solve the shortage of iron wagon skins, made wooden wagon skins. The workers of the South Washing and Selection Plant realized mechanized loading, put down their shoulders, and before solving the mechanical equipment, studied the use of small wooden carts with their own doors to replace the heavy manual lifting, which guaranteed the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement.

Sixth, strengthen the organization and leadership of the movement

In the movement, the mine Party committee strengthened the political and ideological work, strengthened the specific leadership of planning, technology, and production, especially strengthened the investigation and research work, and constantly studied and discovered contradictions and solved contradictions. The method is to check the key, find the problem, layer by layer queuing, layer by layer peeling, until the most core and essential problem is found. Then determine people, determine measures, determine time, and use the three-combination method to overcome the key. For example, when promoting the 60 electric drill, due to the lack of motors, special personnel were organized to go deep into the equipment and tap the potential, and take this as a topic to mobilize the masses to make suggestions. The staff of the electromechanical section proposed the suggestion of connecting the motors in the washing and selection building in series, and six motors were dug out at one time. The canteen and processing plant also adopted the same method, saving motor equipment. As a result, 30 motors were dug out from the entire mine, ensuring the production and promotion of the 60 electric drill. In addition, we also implemented the method of grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping ruthlessly, striving for the first and not the last, and striving for initiative and seizing time. Facts have proved that the earlier the better, the earlier the better. If you grasp it early, it will be good. If you grasp it late, you will be passive step by step. Because of grasping early and grasping tightly, the previous routine of being loose in the front and tight in the back was overcome, ensuring the development of the movement and the rhythmic production.

From the effectiveness of our mine's vigorous technical revolution, it also fully proves the incomparable brilliance of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and proves that the Party's General Line, Great Leap Forward, People's Commune, and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct. Therefore, I resolutely assure the Party that I will always advance bravely along the direction and road pointed out by the Party.

Our achievements are small and still far from the Party's requirements. We must, under the inspiration of the current good situation, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, and further deepen the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulic, and semi-hydraulic as the content, and strive to complete the leap forward plan for 1960 in a greater, better, and more comprehensive way!

专栏：

    乘胜前进再夺煤炭高产
    崔德锡代表谈山东煤炭工业的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理所作的报告和人大常委工作报告。从报告中我们清楚地看到，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，1959年在发展我国社会主义建设事业中所获得的巨大成就和丰富经验，以及在这个基础上提出的1960年国民经济的宏伟计划和展现在全国人民面前的光辉灿烂的前景。我向党和毛主席保证，要坚决地贯彻执行报告中所提出的各项方针、政策和任务，保证更好更全面地超额完成今年国家分配给我们的煤炭生产计划。
    1959年山东煤炭工业采煤掘进双跃进
    两年来，山东煤炭工业同全国其他地区一样，在中央、省委的正确领导下，获得了连续大跃进的辉煌胜利。1958年产煤量比1957年增长了一点二一倍，1959年又比大跃进的1958年增长了67.8％；在基本建设方面，1958年完成投资额比1957年增长64％以上，1959年又比1958年增长了41％以上。我们洪山煤矿也同全国全省各兄弟煤矿一样，全体职工在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，坚决贯彻了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，1958年产煤量比1957年提高46.8％；掘进主巷进度比1957年提高53.8％。1959年，深入开展了以技术革命为中心的大面积高产六比红旗竞赛运动，掀起了全面大跃进的生产高潮，提前十五天超额完成了国家产煤计划，年产量比1958年又增长了29％；掘进主巷进度比1958年增长近一倍。其他各项工作也都取得很大成绩，实现了全年满堂红。
    今年来革新项目层出不穷
    特别是进入1960年以来，根据上级提出的以大面积高产为纲，大力进行五大革命（采掘方法、解放笨重体力劳动、加快回采、掘进钻探进度、简化生产过程、少用和不用坑木的五大革命）猛攻高精尖的要求，广大职工高举毛泽东思想红旗，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，提出了“人家有的我们要学会，人家没有的我们要创造，大干特干加巧干，实现四化一无矿（四化是攉煤机械化、打眼电气化、运输机械化、食堂煤气化。一无是无坑木），以百折不挠的精神，攀登科学技术高峰”的豪迈口号。迅速掀起了以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、水力化、半水力化为内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，全矿到处呈现了革新成风助人为乐的新风气。通风区职工试验物理化学通风法成功，消灭二氧化碳有害气体90％左右，机修组试验电动缠簧成功，效率提高二十倍以上，截至3月底止全矿职工针对生产关键，提出两万五千余条合理化建议，实现了一万一千余条。较大的革新项目实现了四十七项。从采煤到洗选，从生产到生活各个工种，各个方面机械化程度均有较大的增长。同时有将近半数的采掘工作面，使上了坑木代用品，达到无坑木标准，给国家节省了大批有用的建筑木材，并有两个洗选厂实现了集中操纵遥控化的高级生产技术，十处食堂已有九处，实现了煤气化。从而提高了效率，降低了成本，大大改善了职工的劳动条件。以推行新汶局的六○电钻为例，不仅节省了压风机、无缝钢管等大型器材和电力，减少了煤岩粉，而且使打眼效率提高一至四倍。工人们歌颂说：“六○钻真正好，设备小、效率高，打眼不吃煤岩粉，矽肺病害消灭掉，掘进工人笑开颜，感谢党的好领导”。通过技术革命全矿有五百余名工人从笨重体力劳动中解放出来，抽出九百余名工人投入了副业生产，防水等工作，调出七百余名职工支援煤矿新建单位和农业建设。到今年3月，全矿以人计算的机械化程度已由1959年底的23％提高到36％，从而使1960年第一季度的生产在夺取开门红的基础上，又取得月月红首季满堂红的胜利，提前九天半完成了国家产煤计划；提前七天半完成了掘进主巷进度计划，平均日产量比1959年又上长了11％，实现了增产又减人。
    为了实现采煤不用坑木，矿矿有规划，区区有措施，人人有决心，个个写保证
    目前全矿职工正信心百倍干劲十足地为完成和超额完成全年的跃进计划而继续奋勇前进。一、以毛泽东思想为指导坚持政治挂帅
    技术革命的过程首先是思想革命的过程，在技术革命运动中，我们组织广大职工积极学习毛泽东著作，以毛泽东思想来武装职工群众的头脑，这是我们所以取得上述成绩的首要保证。自去年八届八中全会以后，绝大多数职工表现了更高的共产主义觉悟，大胆创造干劲冲天，但也还有少数干部仍存在某些右倾保守思想，如开始推行新汶六○电钻时，有的基层干部反映“新汶是全煤，掘进多，咱是半煤岩，净打硬石头，根本不能推”。通过组织学习毛主席著作，开展鸣放辩论，广大干部职工提高了觉悟。进一步解放了思想，鼓足了干劲，经过反复研究试验，终于得到成功，打石眼效率比风钻提高一倍，有力地驳倒了“条件论”使六○电钻迅速推广起来。广大职工在学习中深切体会到毛泽东思想是我们建设社会主义的锐利武器，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，没有驳不倒的谬论，没有克服不了的困难。他们说“毛主席著作要学好，字字句句要记牢，工作学习不离它，共产主义早来到”，“毛主席著作是法宝，人人要学不可少，这个武器掌握住，天大困难能打倒，过去自卑不敢学，现在越学劲越高”。通过学习，广大职工思想觉悟大大提高，普遍做到听党的话，坚定了走社会主义的决心，牢固地树立了全面跃进的思想，从而出现了干劲一鼓再鼓，上游一争再争，工作不计时间，不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，忘私为公，一切为了实现跃进计划生动活泼的政治局面。总之，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是一切工作取得胜利的唯一重要保证。
    二、层层制订规划，开展竞赛活动
    在广大职工思想觉悟提高的基础上，自上而下发动群众层层制订规划，明确主攻方向。通过四定的方法（定项目，定时间，定措施，定人员）把规划迅速落实到群众中去，发动群众围绕规划和本单位现场生产关键，制订竞赛保证条件，开展学比赶帮竞赛。全矿各井、厂、队、组都根据具体情况订出了不同重点、不同内容的保证条件，作到了井井队队有目标，组组人人有方向。在竞赛中，广大职工发扬了共产主义劳动精神，新人新事层出不穷。如二井职工利用小五行到小六行的溜煤眼，改成小型储煤仓，有力的保证了均衡生产，一井五二队工人试制成功双风钻架子，效率提高一倍等等。
    三、全面规划，重点突破
    在运动中我们抓住主要环节，集中优势兵力，分期分批进行突击，保证实现。在安排革新规划中，我们把需要经过试验的几项重大革新项目，根据各井口生产的需要与可能，进行安排，使每个单位均有一个不同的重点。这样作从井来看重点突出，易于掌握实现，从矿来看几个重大革新项目均有试点，全面进行试验。从而收到事半功倍之效，有力地保证了革新规划的实现。
    四、发挥三结合的作用
    从矿到队建立了有领导干部、工人、技术人员参加的技术革新委员会和研究小组，每进行一项新的革新，都组织专门力量包干到底。他们每日召开“诸葛亮会”分析问题，研究措施，不断提出课题，发动群众提建议，集思广益，围攻关键。在推行六○电钻中，二井革新委员会针对钻头关键，研究措施，发动掘进工，人人作泥型，取长补短，大破钻头关，从而改进了钻头，提高了钻进效率15％左右。这是我们能以不断攻克技术关的主要方法。
    五、土洋并举
    运动中我们认真贯彻了“土洋并举”，“两条腿走路”的方针。六井职工为实现筐车化，没有小绞车，就用辘辘头代替，洪三井为解决铁车皮不足，自制了木车皮，南洗选厂职工实现装车机械化，放下杠子，在未解决机械设备前，研究使用自带开门的小木车，代替了举重的人力抬筐，这些都保证了技术革命运动的深入开展。
    六、加强运动的组织领导
    在运动中，矿党委加强了政治思想工作，加强了对计划、技术和生产的具体领导，特别是加强了调查研究工作，不断的研究发现矛盾，解决矛盾。办法是查关键，找问题，层层排队，层层剥皮，一直找到最核心最本质的问题。然后定人，定措施，定时间，以三结合方法攻破关键。如推行六○电钻时，缺乏电机，即组织专人多头深入排设备，挖潜力，并以此为课题，发动群众提建议，机电科职员提出将洗选楼内电机串联起来的建议，一次挖出六台电机，食堂、加工厂也采取同样方法，省出电机设备，结果全矿挖出三十台电机，保证了六○电钻的制作和推行。另外，我们还贯彻了抓早抓紧抓狠的方法，赶前不赶后，争主动抢时间，事实证明，一早百早，一早百好，抓得早就能好，抓得迟，就一步被动，步步被动，由于抓早抓紧，因而克服了过去前松后紧的常规，保证了运动的开展和有节奏的生产。
    从我矿大闹技术革命所取得的成效来看，也完全证明了党中央和毛主席领导的无比英明，证明了党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，以及一整套“两条腿走路”方针完全正确，因此我坚决向党保证，永远沿着党所指引的方向和道路奋勇前进。
    我们的成绩是微小的，距离党的要求还很远，必须在当前大好形势的鼓舞下，更高地举起毛泽东思想和总路线的红旗，进一步深入开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、水力化、半水力化为内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，为更大更好更全面的完成1960年跃进计划而奋斗！
