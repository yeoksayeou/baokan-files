Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 12th. Since the beginning of spring, the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has received mail and packages containing seeds, fruit tree saplings, and technical books from all over the country almost every day.

To help Tibet develop agricultural production, all regions have sent their best varieties to Tibet. Among the more than 20,000 jin of crop seeds already received are the Nandai 2419 and Wugong 77 improved wheat varieties from Gansu, Hongbangzi sorghum from the Northeast, Baiyuan leek and Yizhangqing cucumber from Shandong, and Dabaigu pepper and fennel from Inner Mongolia. Among the more than 10,000 fruit tree saplings sent, the famous Laiyang pear and Guoguang and Xiangjiao apples accounted for a large proportion.

In the past, crops such as tea, tobacco, peanuts, millet, sorghum, and ginger had never been grown on the Tibetan Plateau. The agricultural departments and seed bureaus of more than ten provinces, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong, Gansu, and Liaoning, are very concerned about this matter and have recently sent seeds of the above crops. In their letters, they enthusiastically suggested conducting trial planting on the Tibetan Plateau.

At present, most of these seeds and saplings have been distributed, and many units have used these seeds and saplings to open up new vegetable gardens and orchards.

    帮助西藏人民发展农业生产
    入春以来各地寄去大批良种和树苗
    新华社拉萨12日电　入春以来，西藏自治区筹委会农牧处几乎每天都收到从全国各地寄来的装有种子、果树苗和技术书籍的邮件和包裹。
    为了帮助西藏发展农业生产，各地都把最优秀的品种寄来西藏。在已经收到的两万多斤农作物种籽中，有甘肃的南大二四一九和武功七七号小麦良种，东北的红棒子高粱，山东的白圆韭菜、一丈青黄瓜，还有内蒙古的大白谷辣椒和小茴香等。在寄来的一万多株果树苗中，闻名的莱阳梨和国光、香蕉苹果占了很多。
    西藏高原上过去从来没有种过茶、烟、花生、小米、高粱、生姜等农作物。四川、云南、山东、甘肃、辽宁等十多个省的农业厅和种子局十分关心这件事，最近分别寄来了以上几种作物的种子。他们在来信中热情地建议在西藏高原上进行试种。
    现在，这些种子和树苗绝大部分发下去，不少单位已利用这些种子和树苗开辟了新的菜园和果园。
