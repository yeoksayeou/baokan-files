Comrades Chairman and Representatives:
    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft State Final Accounts and State Budget, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    Now, I would like to share my thoughts and experiences on the remarkable achievements made since the Great Leap Forward in rescuing patients with toxic dysentery.
    Toxic dysentery is a disease that seriously threatens the lives of children. It is characterized by its rapid onset, multiple changes, and aggressive nature. Before liberation, the mortality rate of this disease was as high as 50% or more. After liberation, through years of mass patriotic health campaigns to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, as well as the efforts of medical personnel, certain achievements have been made in prevention and treatment. According to statistics from Beijing in 1957, the mortality rate was reduced to 22.8%. During the rectification movement, medical personnel placed politics in command. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the mortality rate of this serious disease was further reduced to 4.7% in 1959, achieving remarkable success.
    For more than 30 years, I have been facing the serious problem of toxic dysentery, which seriously endangers children's health, in pediatric medical work. However, in the old society, the bourgeois worldview and medical viewpoints tightly restricted my thinking. Although I wanted to conduct some scientific research on medical technology, the starting point of my research was mainly for my own academic status. Naturally, I turned to research topics that were relatively simple and easy to succeed. Who dared to touch such a difficult problem as toxic dysentery! Therefore, before liberation, I encountered many patients with toxic dysentery every year, and none of the severely ill children could be saved. I could only sigh at these patients, believing that the poisoning was too deep, the disease was too aggressive, and time did not allow for effective treatment. After liberation, with the strong leadership of the Party, the Party and the government were infinitely loyal to the people and infinitely concerned about the next generation. The Party launched the great patriotic health movement, which fundamentally reduced the incidence of dysentery. For the benefit of the broad masses of the people, the Party also taught us pediatric workers that we must proceed from the health of the 600 million people, serve the patients wholeheartedly, fight against the diseases that pose the greatest threat to people's health, and be sure to conquer the fortress of toxic dysentery. It was the Party that pointed out the correct direction for medical scientific research and gave us specific goals to strive for. Under the leadership of the Party, we had such great ambitions.
    The Party pointed out that to overcome this disease, it is necessary to extensively and deeply mobilize medical personnel throughout the city to carry out large-scale collaboration. From 1958, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee, the Beijing Pediatric Research Committee established a toxic dysentery research group, leading pediatric medical institutions throughout the city to mobilize the masses, engage in large-scale collaboration, mutually request consultations, exchange information, and constantly improve treatment methods. In order to pool wisdom, a unified treatment plan was also formulated, and several city-wide thematic academic discussion meetings were held to enable regular exchange and timely promotion of advanced experience in the work. This played a significant role in improving the treatment level of toxic dysentery throughout the city. Facts have proved that engaging in mass movements and relying on the masses to observe and rescue critically ill patients not only overcomes the one-sidedness of individual observation, but also eliminates the limitations of independent treatment. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses are willing to serve the people, give full play to their greatest creativity and enthusiasm, and exert incredible power, which can produce brilliant achievements that people who take the capitalist road cannot achieve.
    I recall that the doctors in the old society conducted research work for the purpose of personal fame. Therefore, they were bound to act independently, not communicate with each other, only believe in themselves, and not believe in others, taking the path of independent work. Among my familiar friends, some even monopolized technology and claimed it as their own. They often attacked each other for personal gain, were unable to cooperate, and could not promote experience. Even if they had some slight achievements in research work, it was impossible to serve the health of the broad masses of the people, thus making the medical face of our country remain in a backward state for a long time.
    In order to fight against toxic dysentery to seize life, medical units in Beijing promptly established emergency rooms and ward rescue teams, equipped with capable cadres, and ensured the supply of medicines and equipment. Medical staff, with selfless labor, worked day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, racing against time to provide close observation and timely treatment to all critically ill children. Many units can check each patient at least every half hour, day and night, and check the seriously ill every three to five minutes. If changes in the condition are found, they are rescued in time, sometimes for more than a dozen hours non-stop. Medical staff guarded the sick children day and night with the tense mood of "flood prevention and blockage," so that many critically ill children who were considered hopeless in the past were snatched back from the brink of death. This communist style has won the praise and trust of the parents of sick children. Only in the new society, where the relationship between medical personnel and patients is a comrade-like relationship, and the moods of doctors and nurses and the parents of sick children are completely consistent, can the rescue of sick children be regarded as their glorious duty. Recalling the relationship between medical personnel and patients in the old society, it was built on the basis of money. If there was no money, they would not see a doctor. It was absolutely impossible to see the communist labor attitude of treating patients as relatives and carrying out rescue day and night in today's new society.
    Mao Zedong Thought leads the people of the whole country to carry out revolution and construction victoriously and unconquerably. Mao Zedong Thought is also a sharp weapon to guide us in fighting against diseases. The thought pointed out by Chairman Mao of despising the enemy strategically and paying attention to the enemy tactically has greatly inspired us. Our medical workers demand to reduce the mortality rate of toxic dysentery with the belief of victory, which is to despise the enemy strategically, but we are very careful and strictly guard each patient, racing against time to carry out rescue, which is to pay attention to the enemy tactically. We also learned the working method of proceeding from reality and combining theory with practice, starting from practical clinical observations, summarizing experience and learning lessons in a timely manner, and concentrating our efforts to solve the main contradictions. Finally, we were able to go beyond textbook knowledge and discovered that toxic dysentery would rapidly cause spasm, circulatory failure, and respiratory paralysis after onset, thus finding and grasping the three main keys that threaten life. In order to break through these three levels, after mastering the performance of the drugs and analyzing the patient's condition, we dared to increase the amount of medication in an unconventional manner. For example, the amount of chlorpromazine used exceeded six to twelve times the amount prescribed in the book, more than two and a half times the maximum amount used in 1958. In this way, we can basically stop spasms after the patient is hospitalized, and even the most serious circulatory failure can be treated effectively, which is to hold the two levels. We are also full of confidence in the most difficult respiratory paralysis level, working hard and cleverly, and actively looking for the law of its occurrence from the clinical aspect. A sick child named Lin Ping was already dying when she was admitted to the hospital. All kinds of measures were used in time, but her blood pressure rose for a while, and then she had convulsions, and then her blood pressure and pulse disappeared. We thought about whether the general amount of medicine prescribed in the book was too small for such a condition? The Party has repeatedly taught us to proceed from clinical reality, analyze specifically, not to be superstitious about literature, and to dare to think and dare to do. Under careful and close observation, the doctors in our hospital gradually increased the doses of norepinephrine and chlorpromazine. Finally, after three days and three nights of intense rescue, Lin Ping survived eleven convulsions, three blood pressure drops, massive gastric bleeding and other critical conditions, and began to have a little consciousness. Her little hand moved when she was injected. Lin Ping was finally rescued! We were extremely excited, and a nurse immediately ran to put flowers on the child and rushed to tell the good news to comrades who were not in the ward. Someone rushed to notify Lin Ping's mother, because she thought Lin Ping had no hope of survival and had already left the hospital. Saving Lin Ping gave us more confidence, and we further summarized the law of respiratory paralysis. We analyzed 160 cases that had abnormal breathing phenomena accumulated daily and found that these phenomena could be summarized into seven different types. We believe that these phenomena are all harbingers of respiratory paralysis. Based on this conclusion, we took preventive measures and gave respiratory stimulants in advance when the harbinger of respiratory paralysis just occurred, thus greatly reducing the death caused by respiratory paralysis. We have thus found the law of the occurrence of respiratory paralysis, basically holding the third level and initially solving the difficult problem of treating toxic dysentery. "Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge," "Go all out, aim high," and the great theory of fully developing subjective initiative guide us, and the call to emancipate the mind encourages us, enabling us to achieve achievements that predecessors have not achieved. These facts fully prove that Mao Zedong Thought is not only a guiding ideology in social sciences, but also a source of victory in natural sciences.
    Under the cultivation of the Party, the growth of new forces is very rapid. Young people in the Mao Zedong era are like flower buds in the spring breeze, rice seedlings after rain, growing and developing vigorously, exceeding the general growth process. In the work of rescuing toxic dysentery, I saw many young medical staff, setting high ambitions, boosting their energy, and advancing along the road of socialist construction. They listen to the Party, break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and vow to fight to the death against toxic dysentery, guarding patients day and night, observing the condition, and rescuing them at any time, until the comatose and dying children regain their lives. I am very moved by the indomitable will of young comrades in the struggle against diseases. In the past, I did not have the courage to break through conventional therapies, nor did I dare to aspire to surpass my predecessors. When young people encounter a series of serious symptoms in patients, they never bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They muster their courage and break through difficulties again and again. This is the great achievement of the Party's many years of hard work in education. In the future, I must learn from their spirit of daring to think and dare to do, starting from the patient, and constantly strive for the people's medical cause.
    In short, the victory of Beijing pediatric workers in the tenacious struggle against toxic dysentery has given me a very profound education. This is only a relatively prominent example. The rescue work of other diseases has also become a new trend throughout the country, saving the lives of thousands of critically ill patients. I have been engaged in pediatric work all my life. Many problems could not be solved in the past, but today they have been solved one by one under the illumination of the general line. The ideal of overcoming diseases that I could not realize in the old society can really be realized today. Our pediatric workers' team, which is both red and expert, has also grown rapidly. Such a leap forward really makes me happy and encouraged, and makes me sincerely realize that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government can medical personnel take the road of being both red and expert, can they rapidly promote children's health care, and can medical science achieve rapid development. In order to achieve better achievements in medical prevention work and scientific research work, our medical workers must conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, further transform the bourgeois world outlook, and establish the proletarian world outlook. We must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red flag of the general line, and under the strong leadership of the Party, advance towards the peak of medical science at the fastest speed.

    抢救小儿中毒性痢疾取得了辉煌的成就
    诸福棠代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于国家决算和国家预算草案的报告、谭震林副总理关于提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    现在我就大跃进以来抢救中毒性痢疾病人的惊人成就，谈谈我的感想和体会。
    中毒性痢疾是严重地威胁着小儿生命的一种病，它的特点是来的快，变化多，病势猛。解放前这种病的病死率高达50％以上。解放后经过几年来群众性的除四害讲卫生的爱国卫生运动和医务人员的努力，在预防和治疗上都取得了一定的成绩。根据北京市1957年的统计，病死率降低到22.8％。在整风运动中，医务人员政治挂了帅，经过了1958年、1959年两年的大跃进，终于在1959年将这个严重疾病的病死率再降低到4.7％，取得了辉煌的成就。
    三十多年来，我在儿科医疗工作中一直面临着中毒性痢疾这个严重危害小儿健康的问题，但是在旧社会里资产阶级的人生观和医疗观点紧紧地箝制了我的思想，虽然要想在医疗技术上作一些科学研究工作，但是研究的出发点主要是为了自己学术上的地位，自然就向着比较简单的、容易成功的研究题目进行探讨，谁还敢于去碰中毒性痢疾这样的难题呢！因此，解放前我每年遇见不少的中毒性痢疾病人，严重的患儿都没有能够挽救，只好对着这样的病人望洋兴叹，认为中毒太深，病势太猛，时间不容许治疗发生有效的作用。解放以后，有了党的坚强领导，党和政府对人民无限忠诚，对下一代又无限关怀，党发动了伟大的爱国卫生运动，从根本上降低了痢疾的发病率。为了广大人民的利益，党还教导我们儿科工作者，必须一切从六亿人民的健康出发，全心全意为病人服务，要向危害人民健康最大的疾病作斗争，一定要攻下中毒性痢疾的堡垒。正是党给我们指出了医学科学研究的正确方向，又给我们指出具体的奋斗目标。在党的领导下，我们才有了这样大的雄心壮志。
    党指出，要战胜这一疾病，必须广泛深入地发动全市医务人员进行大协作。从1958年起，在中共北京市委和市人委的领导下，北京市儿科研究委员会成立了中毒性痢疾研究小组，领导全市儿科医疗机构发动群众，大搞协作，互请会诊，互通情报，不断改进治疗方法。为了集思广益，还制订统一的治疗方案，召开多次的全市性专题学术讨论会，使工作中的先进经验得以定期交流，及时推广。这对提高全市中毒性痢疾的治疗水平起到了很大的作用。事实证明，大搞群众运动，依靠群众来观察和抢救危重疾病，既克服了个人观察的片面性，又消除了单干治疗的局限性。广大群众在党的领导下，愿意为人民服务，发挥了最大的创造性和积极性，发生了不可思议的威力，这就能作出走资本主义道路的人不可能取得的光辉成就。
    我回忆旧社会的医生们，进行研究工作的目的是为了个人成名，因此，就必然各自为政，互不通气，只相信自己，不相信别人，走的是单干的道路。在我所熟悉的朋友中，有的更垄断技术据为己有，往往为了私人名利，互相攻击，既不能进行协作，又不能推广经验，尽管在研究工作中有了些微成就，也不可能为了广大人民的健康服务，因此使我国的医学面貌长久停留在落后的状态。
    为了向中毒性痢疾作争夺生命的斗争，北京市的各医疗单位都及时成立了门诊急救室和病房抢救组，配备了得力干部，保证了药品和器材的供应。医护人员以忘我的劳动，夜以继日、废寝忘餐、分秒必争地对所有危重病儿作到严密的观察和及时的治疗。很多单位，可以作到对每一个病人，不分昼夜至少每半小时检查一次，急重的就三、五分钟检查一次；如果发现病情发生变化，就及时抢救，有时一连达十几小时不能停手。医护人员都以“防洪堵口”的紧张心情，昼夜不停地守护在病儿身旁，使很多过去认为没有希望的危重病儿，从死亡的边缘上夺回了生命。这种共产主义风格，深得病儿家长的赞扬和信任。只有在新社会里，医务人员与病人的关系是同志式的关系，医生护士与病儿家长的心情完全一致，才能把抢救病儿作为自己光荣的职责。回忆起旧社会里的医务人员与病人的关系，是建筑在金钱的基础上，没有钱就不给看病，绝不可能出现今天新社会的以病人当作亲人，夜以继日地进行抢救的共产主义劳动态度。
    毛泽东思想领导着全国人民战无不胜攻无不克地进行革命和进行建设。毛泽东思想也是指导我们与疾病作斗争的锐利武器。毛主席所指出的在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人的思想，对我们的启发很大。我们医务工作者以必胜的信念要求降低中毒性痢疾的病死率，这也就是在战略上藐视了敌人，但是对每一个病人又非常仔细地、严格地守护，分秒必争地进行抢救，这就是在战术上重视了敌人。我们还学习了从实际出发，理论结合实际的工作方法，处处从临床的实际观察入手，及时总结经验，吸取教训，并且集中力量解决主要矛盾，终于能够超出书本知识，发现了中毒性痢疾发病以后会迅速引起痉挛，循环衰竭和呼吸麻痹，从而就找到并且抓住了三个威胁生命的主要关键。为了突破这三关，我们掌握了药物的性能和分析了病人情况后，就敢于破格地增加用药量，例如，冬眠灵的用药量就超过了书本规定的六至十二倍，超过了1958年最大用量的两倍半。这样我们已能作到病人住院后基本不再痉挛，极严重的循环衰竭也能收到疗效，这就是把住了两关。对于最难把住的呼吸麻痹关，我们也信心十足，苦干、巧干，积极地从临床方面寻找它发生的规律。有一个病孩叫林萍，入院时已经垂危，各种措施都及时用上了，但是血压一会上升，一会又抽起风来，一会血压、脉搏又都没有了。我们就想到书本上规定的一般药量对这样的病情是否小了？党曾一再教导我们，要从临床实际出发，具体分析，不要迷信文献，要敢想敢干。我院的医生在细心的严密的观察下，逐步地加大了正肾上腺素和冬眠灵的剂量。终于经过三天三夜的紧张抢救，林萍渡过了十一次抽风、三次血压下降、大量胃出血等垂危情况，开始有了一点知觉，打针时小手会动了，林萍终于被救活了！我们大家兴奋极了，一个护士马上跑去给孩子戴上了花，又忙着把这个好消息告诉没有在病房的同志，有人急忙去通知林萍的妈妈，因为她认为林萍没有活的希望而早已离开了医院。救活了林萍，我们的信心更大了，就进一步总结呼吸麻痹的规律。我们分析了日常积累起来的一百六十份曾有呼吸不正常现象的病例，发现这些现象可以归纳成七种不同的类型。我们认为这些现象都是呼吸麻痹的预兆。根据这个论断，我们就采取预防措施，在呼吸麻痹的预兆刚刚发生的时候就提前给呼吸兴奋药，从而大大地减少了呼吸麻痹所引起的死亡。我们就这样地找到了发生呼吸麻痹的规律，基本上把住了第三关，初步解决了治疗中毒性痢疾的难关。“实践、认识，再实践、再认识”，“鼓足干劲，力争上游”和充分地发挥主观能动性的伟大理论指导着我们，解放思想的号召鼓舞着我们，使我们取得了前人所没有取得的成就。这些事实，充分证明了毛泽东思想不仅是社会科学中的指导思想，而且在自然科学中也是取得胜利的源泉。
    在党的培植下，新生力量的成长是非常迅速的，毛泽东时代的青年人正像春风中的花蕾，雨后的秧苗，朝气勃勃地滋长发育，超过了一般的生长规程。在抢救中毒性痢疾的工作中，我看到了不少青年医护人员，立大志，鼓干劲，沿着社会主义建设的道路前进。他们听党的话，破除迷信，解放思想，誓与中毒性痢疾作殊死战，日夜守护病人，观察病情，随时进行抢救，直至昏迷不醒的垂死的病儿从新获得生命。青年同志与疾病斗争中的顽强意志，使我十分感动。我在过去没有勇气突破常规疗法，也不敢立志超越前人。青年人在遇到病人出现了一系列严重症状时，能在困难面前绝不低头，他们鼓足勇气，一次又一次地突破难关，这是党多年来辛勤教育的伟大成果。我今后一定要学习他们那种从病人出发的敢想敢干的精神，为了人民的医疗事业而不断努力。
    总之，北京市儿科工作者对中毒性痢疾的顽强斗争中取得的胜利，给了我极深刻的教育。这仅仅是一个比较显著的事例，其他疾病的抢救工作，在全国各地也都成为新的风气，救活了成千上万的危重病人。我一辈子从事于儿科工作，很多问题在过去解决不了，今天在总路线的照耀下，一个一个地解决了。我在旧社会里无法实现的战胜疾病的理想，今天真的能够实现了。我们儿科工作者的又红又专的队伍，也飞速地壮大起来了。这样的跃进真使我欢欣鼓舞，使我衷心体会到只有在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，医务人员才能走又红又专的道路，才能迅速推进儿童保健事业，才能使医学科学得到飞速的发展。为了更好地在医疗预防工作和科学研究工作上取得成就，我们医务工作者必须认真学习毛泽东思想，进一步改造资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线的红旗，在党的坚强领导下，以最快的速度向着医学科学的高峰前进。
