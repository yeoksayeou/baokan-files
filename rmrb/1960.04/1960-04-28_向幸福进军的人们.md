    The People Marching Towards Happiness
    Sun Jun (Poetry) Gao Qinggeng (Photography)
    Spring Light on the Plateau
    Spring has come to the plateau,
    The serf system has been buried;
    Thousands of acres of fertile land belong to the people,
    And herds of cattle and sheep have been recovered.
    Slaves become masters,
    Sorrowful cries turn into joy.
    The socialist ideal,
    Brings eternal spring to the plateau.
    Living in Joy
    Free labor,
    Brings people a happy life;
    The “Lang Sheng” who were enslaved for many years,
    Also have their own home.
    See how close they are,
    See how happy they are;
    While driving away poverty,
    They are also playing the battle song of climbing the peak of culture!
    Ode to Youth
    In the past, girls frowned with worry,
    Today, girls are happy to the heart,
    Her moving smiling face,
    Is an ode to youth.
    She looks forward to a bright future,
    She sings of a happy life.
    Hard work is her beautiful nature,
    Happiness is the achievement that socialism gives her!
    Heart to Heart
    It is you who let us escape from the sea of suffering,
    It is you who lead us to the light,
    Socialist motherland,
    Our hearts are connected to yours.
    The reading group is our classroom,
    It spreads the sound of your leap forward,
    Your Tibetan sons and daughters,
    Are immensely proud and happy for your achievements! (Attached picture)

    向幸福进军的人们
    孙俊诗  高庆赓摄影
    高原春光
    高原上的春天来了，
    农奴制度已被埋葬；
    千亩良田归人民，
    又收回成群的牛羊。
    奴隶变成主人，
    悲啼变成欢畅。
    社会主义的理想，
    给高原带来了永恒的春光。
    生活在欢乐中
    自由的劳动，
    给人们带来了欢乐的生活；
    多年被奴役的“朗生”，
    也有了自己的归宿。
    你看他俩多么亲密，
    你看他俩多么快乐；
    在赶走贫困的同时，
    又奏起攀登文化高峰的战歌！
    青春颂
    从前姑娘愁到了眉尖，
    今天姑娘喜到了心窝，
    她的一张动人的笑脸，
    就是一首青春的颂歌。
    她憧憬着美好的未来，
    她歌唱着幸福的生活。
    勤劳是她的优美的本性，
    愉快是社会主义给她的战果！
    心连着心
    是你让我们脱离苦海，
    是你使我们走向光明，
    社会主义的祖国呀，
    我们和你心连着心。
    读报组是我们的课堂，
    它传播着你的跃进的声音，
    你的藏族儿女啊，
    为你的成就感到无比自豪的欢欣！（附图片）
