The complete eradication of imperialism and colonialism in Asia and Africa, and the defeat of their new conspiracies to maintain colonial rule in Asia and Africa, are the central issues being discussed at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry, and are also the most important tasks in the current struggle of the Asian and African people.

Tremendous Achievements in the National Independence Movement

Under the heroic struggle of the increasingly awakened African people, imperialism is losing its positions in Africa step by step. A series of countries have achieved varying degrees of independence. This year, Togo, Congo, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, Somaliland, and Nigeria will declare their independence. By the end of the year, there will be sixteen independent countries governed by Africans in Africa. In the regions still under colonial rule, the struggle for national independence is flourishing like a prairie fire. The death knell of colonialism has already sounded in Africa, but imperialism is still making a last-ditch struggle. They are not relaxing their armed suppression and continue to adopt all bloody and barbaric means. At the same time, in a situation where they have no choice, they are increasingly resorting to political conspiracies to maintain their colonial rule. They use certain formal concessions to soften the edge of the African people's struggle, use high positions and generous salaries to lure and buy off certain upper-class figures, and they advocate deceptive platitudes such as "peaceful evolution" and "orderly transition," in an attempt to make the African people give up their struggle and forever be slaves under the iron heel of imperialism.

Old-Line Colonialism Plays New Political Conspiracies

Imperialism is now posing as generous, promising some of its colonies "independence." This is naturally not because they have changed their aggressive nature, but primarily because the awakening and struggle of the African people have made it impossible for them to rule in the old way. This is a symbol of the decline of the colonial system and a result of the victory of the African people's struggle.

The purpose of imperialism in adopting these tactics of superficially granting "independence" is to continue to maintain their colonial interests and privileges. France promised the Mali Federation "independence," but according to the "cooperation agreements" that France forced the Mali Federation to accept, the Mali Federation must continue to remain within the "Community," French troops will continue to be stationed on the territory of the Mali Federation, including its capital Dakar, the Mali Federation must "coordinate" its foreign policy with France, and the Mali Federation must not only continue to remain within the Franc zone but also within the monetary and customs union of French West African countries, the official language of the Mali Federation will still be French, and the administrative management of the University of Dakar will also be the responsibility of France. In this way, France continues to control the lifeline of this country in all aspects, including military, diplomatic, financial, economic, and even cultural and educational. In a situation where violent suppression and false promises could not destroy the Congolese national independence movement, Belgium finally had to agree to Congolese independence, but it also attempted to maintain its control over the Congo by drafting a constitution and formulating laws for the Congo, as well as signing treaties with the Congo.

Another set of conspiracies that imperialism is playing in Africa is the implementation of so-called "constitutional reforms," the content of which is nothing more than holding elections under the manipulation of the colonial authorities, adding some African members to the legislature controlled by the colonialists, and setting up some African ministers in the colonial government, without touching the essence of the colony still being the world of imperialism. British government officials, including British Colonial Secretary Macleod, have been traveling back and forth on the London-Africa route, with the goal of implementing a series of such plans in the colonies of Central and East Africa. For Tanganyika and Uganda, Britain has already proposed so-called "universal suffrage" "constitutional reform" proposals to be held in 1960 and 1961 respectively. For Nyasaland, Britain has announced that it will hold a "constitutional conference" on this country in London in June or July. The blackmailing nature of this so-called "constitutional conference" was particularly evident in the recent (January-February) Kenya "constitutional conference." At this unequal conference, which was called a "roundtable conference," Britain forced the African members of the Kenyan legislature to accept the "constitutional reform" plan proposed by the British Colonial Secretary. This plan stipulates that the British Colonial Office will continue to rule Kenya; the British Governor will nominate ministers; and of the sixty-five members of Kenya's future legislative council, only thirty-three will be "elected," and this "election" can be seen to be so hypocritical from the harsh conditions it imposes on those participating in the election. The Kenyan African representatives attending the meeting said that the results of the meeting were "far from meeting the aspirations of the Africans." This is enough to tell people how much hope can be placed on this kind of "constitutional reform" arranged by the colonialists.

U.S. Imperialism is the Most Dangerous Enemy

Now, those who are fighting for African national independence are increasingly clearly seeing that on their path of struggle there is an extremely cunning and also the most dangerous enemy—the demonic shadow of U.S. imperialism. On the one hand, the United States supports old-line colonial empires such as Britain and France in suppressing the African national independence movement; on the other hand, it uses various deceptive means of appeasement to deal with African countries and people, attempting to replace the positions of old-line imperialists such as Britain and France in Africa in order to achieve the goal of dominating Africa.

Recently, U.S. government officials and all kinds of U.S. delegations have been flocking to Africa in droves. Following Eisenhower's visit to North Africa last year, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge and Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Wilcox successively visited Africa at the beginning of this year. Officials from the U.S. International Cooperation Administration and delegations composed of students from U.S. military academies have carried out extensive activities in various African countries in the name of "field training" and "direct investigation."

The United States is preparing to use "U.S. aid" to further infiltrate and expand into Africa. U.S. International Cooperation Administration Director Riegelman called so-called "aid" to Africa the "second major feature" of this year's U.S. "foreign aid" plan. Not long ago, U.S. State Department and International Cooperation Administration officials held a meeting in Madrid to specifically study the issue of breaking into Africa by means of "U.S. aid."

The United States is now particularly emphasizing the need to improve "the education of African talents" and "training programs," and has formulated a so-called "Special Tropical Africa Plan" for this purpose, attempting to use this method to cultivate a group of pro-American elements and "African talents" who can serve the United States. At the same time, the United States is inviting a large number of famous African figures, scholars, and intellectuals to visit the United States in order to win them over. Through the so-called "International Exchange Program," the U.S. State Department invited more than 560 African leaders, experts, educators, and students to visit the United States in 1959, and it plans to double the number of exchanges in 1960.

The African People Will Surely Triumph

Despite all these means of imperialism being so cunning, the African people can see through the truth and recognize who are the enemies and who are the friends. African public opinion calls this shift in colonialist tactics "neo-colonialism." At the recent All-African People's Conference, Guinean representative Diallo said that neo-colonialism is a threat to Africa, and the imperialists have discovered that they cannot stop the course of history and change the African people's determination to be independent, so they are trying every means to make the African people give up their struggle. Cameroonian representative Moumie condemned imperialism for trying every means to frustrate the people with so-called "reforms" and even by announcing the granting of "independence." He pointed out that although the United States makes some high-sounding statements, it is the head of neo-colonialism.

The African people are determined to defeat the conspiracies of their common enemy, imperialism, and eliminate the difficulties and obstacles they create. The All-African People's Conference, which was held not long ago, declared in the general policy resolution on striving for African independence that the movement to strive for African independence is irresistible, and at the same time called on the people of all African countries to be vigilant. As long as the African people unite under the common goal of opposing imperialism and resolutely and continuously strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle, victory will surely belong to the African people.

### 非洲殖民制度丧钟已经敲响  帝国主义仍在进行垂死挣扎

    非洲殖民制度丧钟已经敲响  帝国主义仍在进行垂死挣扎
    彻底铲除在亚非的帝国主义和殖民主义，击败它们为了在亚非维持殖民统治的新阴谋，这是第二届亚非人民团结大会正在科纳克里讨论的中心问题，也是亚非人民当前最重要的斗争任务。
    民族独立运动成就巨大
    在日益觉醒的非洲人民的英勇斗争下，帝国主义正在一步步丧失他们在非洲的阵地。一系列的国家已经取得不同程度的独立。今年年内，还将有多哥、刚果、马里联邦、马达加斯加、索马里兰、尼日利亚等六个国家宣布独立，这样到年底，在非洲将出现十六个由非洲人治理的独立国家。在仍然处于殖民统治下的地区，争取民族独立的斗争蓬勃开展，如烈火燎原。殖民制度的丧钟已经在非洲敲响，但是帝国主义还在垂死挣扎。它们不放松武力镇压，继续采取一切血腥野蛮手段。而同时，在不得已的情势下，它们正愈来愈借助于政治阴谋，来保持它们的殖民统治。它们用某些形式上的让步来软化非洲人民斗争的锋芒，用高官厚禄来引诱和收买某些上层人物，它们鼓吹“和平进化”、“有条不紊地过渡”等等骗人的滥调，要想使非洲人民放弃他们的斗争，永远做帝国主义铁蹄下的奴隶。
    老牌殖民主义玩弄新的政治阴谋
    帝国主义现在装扮出慷慨的姿态，答应给它们的一些殖民地以“独立”。这自然不是由于它们改变了侵略的本性，而首先是因为非洲人民的觉醒和斗争已经使它们再也不能用老办法统治下去。这是殖民制度没落的象征，是非洲人民斗争胜利的结果。
    帝国主义采取表面上给予“独立”的这一些手法，目的在于继续保持它们的殖民利益和特权。法国答应给马里联邦“独立”，但是，按照法国强迫马里联邦接受的这种或那种“合作协定”，马里联邦必须继续留在“共同体”内，法军将继续驻在马里联邦的国土上包括它的首都达卡尔在内，马里联邦必须同法国“协调”它们的外交政策，马里联邦不但要继续留在法郎区内而且还留在法属西非国家的货币和关税联盟内，马里联邦的正式语言仍然是法语，达卡尔大学的行政管理也要由法国负责。这样，法国就在军事、外交、财政经济以至文化教育等各个方面继续掌握着这个国家的命脉。比利时在用暴力镇压、虚伪诺言都不能摧毁刚果民族独立运动的局面下，终于不得不答应让刚果独立，但是它也企图通过为刚果草拟宪法、制订法律以及同刚果签订条约等等办法来保持对刚果的控制。
    帝国主义在非洲玩弄的另一套阴谋就是实施所谓“宪制改革”，其内容不外乎是在殖民当局操纵下举行选举，在殖民者控制的立法议会中增加一些非洲人议员，在殖民政府中摆设一些非洲人部长等等，而丝毫不触动殖民地仍然是帝国主义天下的实质。包括英国殖民大臣麦克劳德在内的英国政府官员奔波于伦敦—非洲道上，目标就是在中非和东非的殖民地推行一系列的这样的计划。对于坦噶尼喀和乌干达，英国已经分别提出在1960年和1961年举行所谓“普选”的“宪制改革”方案，对于尼亚萨兰，英国已经宣布要在6月或7月在伦敦举行关于这个国家的“宪制会议”。这种所谓“宪制会议”的讹诈性在最近举行（1月—2月）的怯尼亚“宪制会议”中表现得特别明显，在这个号称“圆桌会议”的不平等的会议上，英国迫使怯尼亚的非洲籍议员接受英国殖民大臣提出的“宪制改革”计划，这个计划规定，英国的殖民地部将继续统治怯尼亚；英国总督提名部长；在怯尼亚未来的立法会议的六十五名议员中，只有三十三名由“选举”产生，而这种“选举”从它对于参加选举者所加的苛刻条件，也可以看出是多么虚伪。出席会议的怯尼亚非洲人代表说，会议的结果“远不能满足非洲人的愿望”。这就足以告诉人们对于殖民者布置的这种“宪制改革”究竟能够寄予几许希望。
    美帝国主义是最危险的敌人
    现在，为非洲民族独立而斗争的人士正愈来愈清晰地看到，在他们斗争的道路上有着一个极其狡猾也是最为危险的敌人——美帝国主义的魔影。美国一方面支持英、法等老牌殖民帝国镇压非洲民族独立运动，另一方面用各种欺诈笼络手段，对付非洲国家和人民，妄图取代英法等老牌帝国主义在非洲的地位，以达到制霸非洲的目的。
    近来美国的政府官员们和形形色色的美国代表团成群地涌往非洲。继艾森豪威尔去年访问北非后，美国驻联合国代表洛奇、负责国际组织事务助理国务卿威尔科克斯在今年年初相继到非洲活动。美国国际合作署的官员和美国军事学院学员组成的代表团以“实地训练”、“直接考察”的名义到非洲各国作了广泛的活动。
    美国正在准备利用“美援”进一步向非洲渗入和扩张。美国国际合作署署长李德尔伯格把所谓“援助”非洲称为今年美国“援外”计划中的“第二个主要特点”。不久以前，美国国务院和国际合作署官员曾经在马德里举行会议，专门研究借“美援”打入非洲的问题。
    美国现在特别强调要改进“对非洲人才的的教育”和“训练计划”，并且为此制订了一项所谓“热带非洲特别计划”，企图用这种办法来培养一批亲美分子和能够替美国服务的“非洲人才”。同时，美国大批邀请非洲著名人士和学者、知识分子访问美国，以便加以笼络。美国国务院通过所谓“国际交流计划”，在1959年已经邀请五百六十多名非洲领袖、专家、教育家和学生访美，它计划在1960年使交换人数再增加一倍。
    非洲人民一定胜利
    尽管帝国主义的这一切手段是如此谲诈，非洲人民能够识破真相，认清敌友。非洲舆论把殖民主义的这种策略的变换称为“新殖民主义”。在不久前举行的全非人民大会上，几内亚代表迪亚洛说，新殖民主义是对非洲的威胁，帝国主义者发现自己不能制止历史的进程和改变非洲人民的独立决心，因此想尽办法想使非洲人民放弃斗争。喀麦隆代表穆米埃谴责帝国主义想尽办法用所谓“改革”甚至于宣布给予“独立”的办法来挫败人民。他指出，美国尽管冠冕堂皇发表一些声明，但它是新殖民主义的头子。
    非洲人民决心击败共同敌人帝国主义的阴谋诡计，排除它们制造的困难障碍。不久前举行的全非人民大会在关于争取非洲独立的总政策决议中宣布，争取非洲独立的运动是势不可当的，同时呼吁非洲各国人民提高警惕。只要非洲人民在反对帝国主义的共同目标下团结一致，坚决地不断加强反帝斗争，胜利一定属于非洲人民。　（新华社）
