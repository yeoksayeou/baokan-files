Design Method Great Revolution, Design Work Great Leap Forward
Representative Yang Tingbao Talks About Great Reform of Design Work

Presidium, fellow representatives:

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960. As an architectural worker, in addition to earnestly implementing the spirit of these reports, I would like to report to the conference on the current situation of the great leap forward in architectural design work and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Please correct any inadequacies.

	Meeting the Needs of Rapid Construction,
	Vigorously Promoting Rapid and High-Quality Design

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party, China's architectural design work achieved a continued great leap forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. Not only did it complete the annual design tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, but it also developed and strengthened the design team and improved the political and ideological level, technical level, and management level of the design personnel. What is particularly important is that through the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a relatively complete set of methods for rapid and high-quality design was summarized. This method not only meets the needs of rapid construction, fundamentally reverses the situation where design cannot keep up with construction, and further implements the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, it marks a new development in design work. Practice in various places has proved that rapid and high-quality design is suitable for both architectural design and technological design; large design institutes can adopt it, and small design units can also implement it. Therefore, the national design system has been widely promoted, making it a regular design method.

In 1960, the national architectural design departments actively responded to the Central Committee's call for a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization in national industrial and transportation enterprises. On the basis of 1959, focusing on the universal implementation of rapid and high-quality design and reducing the self-weight of buildings, a widespread and in-depth mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "five-izations" (design standardization, calculation chart-ization and electrification, drawing assembly-ization, data handbook-ization, tool mechanization) and "six news" (new structure, new architectural style, new technology, new equipment, new materials, new design theory) was launched. The characteristics of this movement are rapid development, magnificent scale, great momentum, and rich content. Compared with the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in 1958 and 1959, it is broader and deeper. Many regions and units have made new developments in technical innovation and technical revolution on the basis of "five-izations" and "six news," and are advancing towards design electrification, mechanization, automation, and factoryization. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of design personnel is unprecedentedly high, further breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and fully developing the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, creating a lively situation of "everyone wants to create, everyone engages in innovation."

We know that there are a large number of complex calculation and drawing tasks in design work, which often occupy more than 80% of manpower and time. In the past, it was always impossible to break the "routine," and people were accustomed to drawing stroke by stroke and calculating item by item. After the "five-izations" of design work were implemented, labor efficiency was greatly improved. Some people praised: "In the past, the drafting method was old, and every stroke was indispensable. When the time for issuing drawings was tight, we worked overtime all night. The flowers of technical revolution bloomed, and typesetting design is good and fast. To design a large warehouse, it only takes one hour."

The so-called design standardization is to compile and adopt a large number of standard designs, standard components, standard accessories, and unified detailed drawings. This can not only reduce repetitive designs and save design manpower, but also avoid errors and omissions in individual designs. At present, the adoption rate of standard designs generally reaches 40% to 50%, and some have reached more than 60%. The so-called calculation chart-ization is to make basic calculation formulas and data in structural, architectural, production equipment, sanitary technology, and budget aspects into charts. You can find the answer by looking it up without having to calculate it again, which can improve work efficiency dozens of times. For example, for an ordinary single-story factory building, the structural calculation from the foundation to the roof truss used to take more than a month, about a week in 1958, and only a few hours in 1959 using calculation charts. Moreover, the data is accurate and easy to ensure quality. At present, 70% of the calculation work has adopted this method.

The so-called drawing assembly-ization is the "typesetting" drawing method, using methods such as "wax paper typesetting," "lead-zinc typesetting," "fill-in drawings," and "drawing clippings" to decompose some commonly used drawings into unit pictures. When needed, they are pieced together, typeset, and printed into drawings, which saves a lot of drawing and tracing work and improves efficiency several times to dozens of times.

The so-called data handbook-ization is to compile various technical data commonly used in design, such as various technical norms, regulations, and standards, into books for reference, which greatly saves labor and speeds up the design.

The so-called tool mechanization is to specialize and multi-functionalize calculation and drawing tools. Now, various specialized slide rules, calculation disks, etc. have been created in various places, which can improve efficiency by one to dozens of times.

Various design institutes have integrated various scattered and fragmented experiences of implementing "five-izations" through large-scale exhibitions, large-scale appraisals, large-scale supporting facilities, and large-scale promotions, and have carried out supporting facilities according to types of work, processes, specialties, workshops, factories, or projects in order to incorporate them into technical regulations and promote them on a large scale. For example, the Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has equipped 27 sets of various typesetting, 16 sets of fill-in drawings, and 105 sets of general-purpose designs and general-purpose detailed drawings. The utilization rate of the above "three drawings" reaches more than 90% except for individual types of work that only reach 80%; 34 sets of calculation charts, except for individual types of work whose utilization rate only reaches 80%, the rest have reached more than 90%; 40 sets of various data manuals, with a utilization rate of 80%. Other design institutes have similar situations.

On the basis of the large-scale supporting facilities of the "five-izations" experience, design work has the conditions to embark on the road of electrification, mechanization, automation, and factoryization. Electrification starts from structural calculation, that is, using electrical computers for structural calculation. However, it quickly developed from structural types of work to architecture, heating and ventilation, water supply and drainage, power lighting, budget, economic analysis, and building materials production technology, as well as many links in each type of work, all of which can be calculated using electrical computers. Moreover, it has exceeded the scope of calculation and is developing in many other aspects of design work. For example, some design institutes use electrically operated data storage cabinets, use electrical transmission of drawing tools and documents, and use telecommunications equipment to manage production, making electrification a widely adopted method. Now, various design institutes are actively manufacturing various types of electrical computers. The Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has achieved achievements in this regard, which have been introduced by the People's Daily. Others such as the Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute have self-made more than 100 units, and the Liaoning Provincial Architectural Design Institute has manufactured nearly 100 units. Compared with the early stage of implementing "five-izations," the efficiency has increased a lot. For example, the use of hyperbolic paraboloid shell resistor computers has reduced the workload that used to take 15 days to complete to 2 hours, increasing efficiency by more than 100 times and avoiding calculation errors. Design personnel praised electrification with incomparable pleasure:

"In the past, calculations were busy and cumbersome, and calculation tasks were piled up like mountains. We put on the cold stars in the morning and wore the moon in the evening, with sore backs, eye strain, and sweat on our heads. Today, electrification has been realized, and all the data is obtained by pressing a button. The task is completed in an instant, freeing up time to tackle cutting-edge technology." At present, electrical computers are developing from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex and precise, from single-machine special-purpose to single-machine multi-purpose, from small-scale integration to large-scale integration, and from telecommunications indicators and resistance simulation to electron tube development.

With the development of calculation electrification, tool mechanization has also achieved further results. Some design units have adopted the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods and taken self-reliance measures to make a batch of drawing, tracing, and blueprinting operations mechanized and semi-mechanized. This can greatly save labor, improve production efficiency, and shorten the drawing time. For example, the Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute's creation of a drawing folding machine has basically eliminated manual operation in this link and improved work efficiency by two to five times. The semi-mechanized tools used by various architectural design institutes to cut blueprint paper can improve work efficiency by eight to ten times.

On the basis of electrification and mechanization, various design units are developing towards linkage and automation. Electrically or mechanically link devices to automatically perform work. For example, the Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute has manufactured 13 sets of various automated equipment such as transmission signals, which has automated the transmission of documents, printing, and finished product binding. The Liaoning Provincial Architectural Design Institute has manufactured a linked machine that automatically completes the entire process from blueprinting, separating drawings, washing drawings, selecting drawings to binding, which has improved work efficiency by five to six times. The masses wrote poems to praise: "Everyone likes linkage and automation, machines do the tedious tasks, design work is done by pressing a button, and the results are immediately visible."

Design work can also adopt large-scale production methods

Due to the great development of design electrification, mechanization, and automation, productivity has been greatly liberated, which has promoted corresponding changes in production relations, and factory-style labor organizations have emerged. For example, the Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute established three design workshops (civil design workshop, industrial design workshop, and building materials design workshop) and a building materials testing plant. Each workshop has a preparation section, a calculation station, an assembly section, an inspection station, a new product processing section, and a printing factory. In this way, various advanced tools and advanced experiences are linked together to form a parallel assembly line, so that design work adopts large-scale production methods like a factory, which increases design efficiency by dozens or even hundreds of times. Therefore, many design personnel praised: "Design factoryization, the power is really great, forming an assembly line, drawings come out in an instant, individual work becomes collective, the wisdom of the masses is great." It also said: "New seconds and different times change in an instant, design work flies forward, put down the trivial matters of drawing, and go to the factory with a smile."

While vigorously carrying out the design method revolution, various design units also paid attention to the revolution in design content, carried out "six news" design, strengthened scientific research, and tackled technical cutting-edge, and have achieved preliminary results, especially in new technologies, new materials, new structures, and new equipment. Some major creations have been made. For example, the Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute and the Gansu Provincial Design Institute successfully trial-produced vibration anvil wall panels. Using this type of anvil wall panel for construction can not only reduce the self-weight of buildings by 50%, but also save steel by 40%, wood by 30%, and cement by 10%. The new technology building in Harbin City adopts new structures and new materials such as pumice silicate blocks and arched floor slabs, which can reduce the self-weight of the building by 30% and save steel by 30%. Some projects adopt steel wire mesh cement roof structure, which can reduce the self-weight of the building by 50% and save steel by 10% to 30% and cement by 20%. There are many similar examples.

Through vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, various design units have solved many key problems in production and broken through many weak links. As a result, the production level of design has improved rapidly and production plans have been completed very well. According to the statistics of the directly affiliated institutes of the Ministry of Construction Engineering alone, the total output value completed in January this year was 3.87 times that of the same period last year, breaking the "routine" of being loose at the beginning of the year and tight at the end of the year; the total output value completed in February increased by 60% compared with January; the total output value completed in the first and middle ten days of March was 17% more than that completed in the entire month of February. The design quality has also been improved. The quality of the projects designed in January and February was all excellent; at the same time, investment was saved by about 6.5%. The situation in the design units of other ministries is similar.

Before the Spring Festival this year, the Architectural Society of China held a national working conference, issuing a call to local societies and all members to "everyone should devote themselves to the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution." Local architectural societies have formulated work plans around the central tasks of the local party committees. Members have gone deep into the basic construction site, and under the leadership of the party committee, together with the workers, vigorously carried out inventions and creations, exchanged and promoted advanced experiences, carried out academic debates, and trained technical cadres and technical workers, doing a lot of work. For example, the Shenyang City Society and the Beijing City Society adopted the form of organizing treasure offering and experience learning conferences and experience exchange conferences in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in architectural design, introducing different experiences of various design units to each other and disseminating them widely, which played a role in promoting the movement.

In short, the achievements made in national architectural design work in the past year or so are tremendous. This is the result of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the result of the vigorous leadership and support of the party committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions and party committees at all levels, and the result of all architectural design personnel holding high the general line and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, the first quarter of 1960 has passed. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are seizing the red opening of the second quarter on the basis of completing the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. This conference has given the people of the whole country great encouragement, everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher, the spirit of creation is becoming more and more developed, and a great situation of sustained leap forward has already appeared before our eyes. Our architectural designers must seize the current excellent situation and carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "five-izations" and "six news" more widely and deeply. At the same time, we must actively cooperate with and help construction and production units to promote mechanization and semi-mechanization; actively support agricultural construction and serve agricultural technical transformation; and contribute to organizing the economic life of urban people. We firmly believe that as long as we rely closely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to vigorously carrying out mass movements, and move forward along the road guided by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will be able to achieve a better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward in architectural design work in 1960 on the basis of existing achievements.

    设计方法大革命  设计工作大跃进
    杨廷宝代表谈设计工作大改革主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。我作为一个建筑工作者，除了认真地贯彻执行这些报告的精神以外，现将当前建筑设计工作大跃进和技术革新、技术革命运动的情况，向大会作汇报。不妥之处请大家指正。
      满足快速施工需要，
      大搞快速优质设计
    1959年，我国的建筑设计工作，在党的领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了继续大跃进。不但提前和超额完成了全年的设计任务，而且发展壮大了设计队伍，提高了设计人员的政治思想水平、技术水平和管理水平。特别重要的是，经过技术革新和技术革命运动，总结出一套比较完整的快速优质设计的方法。这种方法，既满足了快速施工的需要，根本扭转了设计赶不上施工的局面，并进一步贯彻了多快好省的方针，它标志着设计工作有了一个新的发展。各地的实践证明，快速优质设计，既适用于建筑设计，也适用于工艺设计；大的设计院可以采用，小的设计单位也能实行。因此，全国的设计系统已在普遍地推行，使它成为经常的设计方法。
    1960年，全国建筑设计部门积极响应了中央提出的在全国工业和交通企业中大搞以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的号召，在1959年的基础上，围绕着普遍推行快速优质设计和减轻建筑物自重这个中心环节，广泛深入地开展了以“五化”（设计标准化、计算图表化和电气化、制图装配化、资料手册化、工具机械化）“六新”（新的结构、新的建筑风格、新的工艺、新的设备、新的材料、新的设计理论）为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。这个运动的特点是发展迅速，规模壮阔，声势浩大，内容丰富，比起1958年和1959年的技术革新和技术革命运动来，更加宽广、深入。不少地区和不少单位已经在“五化”“六新”的基础上，使技术革新和技术革命又有了新的发展，正在向设计电气化、机械化、自动化、工厂化进军。广大设计人员的革命热情空前高涨，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，充分发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，出现了一个“人人想创造，个个搞革新”的生动活泼的局面。
    我们知道，设计工作中有大量的、繁复的计算和制图工作，这些工作往往占用80％以上的人力和时间。过去总是打不破“常规”，习惯一笔一笔地画，一项一项地算。实行了设计工作的“五化”以后，劳动效率大大提高。有人歌颂说“过去制图老一套，一笔一画不能少，遇到出图时间紧，加班加点干通宵。技术革命鲜花开，活版设计好又快，设计一个大仓库，一个小时就出来”。
    所谓设计标准化，就是大量编制和采用标准设计、标准构件、标准配件和统一详图，这样，既能减少重复设计，节省设计力量，又能避免单独设计中的差错和漏项。目前标准设计的采用面一般达到40％到50％，有的已达到60％以上。所谓计算图表化，就是把结构、建筑、生产设备、卫生技术和预算等方面的基本计算公式和数据制成图表，一查便知，不用再算，能提高工作效率几十倍，如作一个普通单层厂房，从基础到屋架的结构计算，过去需要一个多月时间，1958年需一周左右，1959年采用计算图表只要几个小时就够了。而且数据准确，容易保证质量，目前已有70％的计算工作，采用了这种方法。
    所谓制图装配化，就是“活版”制图法，采用“蜡纸活版”、“铅锌活版”、“填充图”、“图纸剪贴”等方法，把一些常用的图纸分解成单元图片，需要时拼凑排版，晒印成图，这就省去了大量的制图、描图工作，提高效率几倍到几十倍。
    所谓资料手册化，就是把设计中常用的各种技术资料，如各种技术定额、规定、标准等编印成册，以便查考，大大节省了劳动力，加快了设计速度。
    所谓工具机械化，就是使计算和制图工具专业化多能化，现在各地已创造了不少专业的计算尺，计算圆盘等，可以提高效率一倍至几十倍。
    各设计院把实行“五化”的各种分散、零碎的经验，通过大展览、大鉴定、大配套、大推广的办法，按工种、工序、专业、车间、工厂或工程，进行配套，以便纳入技术规程，大量推广。如建筑工程部的北京工业建筑设计院已配成各种活版二十七套，填充图十六套，通用设计和通用详图一百零五套，以上“三图”的使用率除个别工种只有80％以外，其余各工种都达到90％以上；计算图表三十四套，除个别工种的使用率只达80％以外，其余各工种已达90％以上；各种资料手册四十套，使用率达到80％以上。其他各设计院也都有类似情形。
    在“五化”经验大配套的基础上，设计工作就有条件走上电气化、机械化、自动化、工厂化的道路。电气化，是从结构计算开始的，就是用电气化计算机进行结构计算。但很快就由结构工种发展到建筑、采暖通风、给水排水、电力照明、预算、经济分析以及建筑材料生产工艺等各个工种和每个工种的许多环节，都可以用电气化计算机进行计算。而且已经超出计算的范围，正在向设计工作的许多其他方面发展，如有些设计院用电操纵资料保管柜，用电气传送绘图工具和文件资料，用电讯设备管理生产，使电气化成为广泛采用的方法。现在，各设计院都在积极制造各种各样的电气化计算机，冶金部的沈阳铝镁设计院在这方面的成绩，人民日报已有介绍，其他如建筑工程部北京工业建筑设计院，东北工业建筑设计院均已自制一百余台，辽宁省建筑设计院制造了近百台。比实行“五化”的初期，效率又增加很多，如采用双曲扁壳电阻计算机，使过去需要十五天才能算完的工作量，现在二小时就完成了，提高效率一百多倍，而且避免了计算的差错。设计人员以无比愉快的心情歌颂电气化：
  “过去计算忙又繁，计算任务堆成山，晨披寒星晚戴月，腰酸眼花满头汗，今朝实现电气化，电钮一按数据全，顷刻之间任务完，腾出时间攻尖端”。目前，电气化计算机正在由低级走向高级，由简单走向复杂和精密，由一机专用走向一机多用，由小综合走向大综合，以及由电讯指示器、电阻模拟式向电子管式发展。
    随着计算电气化的发展，工具机械化也取得了进一步的成效。有些设计单位根据洋土结合的方针，采取自力更生的办法，制成了一批制图、描图、晒图变为机械化半机械化操作。这就可以大大节省劳动力，提高生产效率，缩短出图时间。如北京工业建筑设计院创造的图纸折叠机，基本上消灭了这个环节的手工操作，提高工效二至五倍。各建筑设计院采用的半机械化工具裁剪晒图纸，可以提高工效八至十倍。
    各设计单位在电气化、机械化的基础上，正在向联动化、自动化发展。使电气装置或机械装置联动起来，自动进行工作。如东北工业建筑设计院已制成各种传送信号等自动化设备十三台，使传送文件资料、印刷、成品装订实行了自动化。辽宁省建筑设计院已制造了一台晒图、分图、洗图、选图到装订全部自动化的联动机器，提高了工效五、六倍。群众写诗歌颂：“联动自动人人欢，繁琐任务机器干，设计工作按电纽，转瞬成果放眼前”。
    设计工作也可以采用大生产的方式
    由于设计电气化、机械化、自动化的大发展，大大解放了生产力，这就促使生产关系相应改变，出现了工厂形式的劳动组织。如东北工业建筑设计院全院成立三个设计车间（民用设计车间、工业设计车间、建材设计车间）和一个建筑材料试验厂。每个车间，下设准备工段、计算站、装配工段、检验站、新产品加工工段、印刷工厂。这样，把各种先进工具和先进经验连贯起来，组成平行流水作业线，使设计工作像工厂一样采用了大生产的方式，使设计效率提高几十以至几百倍。因此，许多设计人员歌颂：“设计工厂化，威力真叫大，组成流水线，出图一刹那，单干变集体，群众智慧大”。又说：“秒新时异瞬万变，设计工作飞向前，放下制图琐碎事，走向工厂笑开颜”。
    各设计单位在大搞设计方法革命的同时，也注意了设计内容上的革命，开展“六新”设计，加强科学研究，攻取技术尖端，并已取得了初步成绩，特别是在新技术、新材料、新结构、新设备方面，有了一些重大的创造。如东北工业建筑设计院和甘肃省设计院试制成功了震动砧墙板，用这种砧墙板进行建筑，不但能减轻建筑物自重50％，而且可以节省钢材40％，木材30％，水泥10％。哈尔滨市建筑的新技术大楼，采用了浮石矽酸盐块及拱形楼板等新结构、新材料，能减轻建筑物自重30％，节约钢材30％。有些工程采用了钢丝网水泥屋盖结构，能减轻建筑物自重50％，节省钢材10％至30％，水泥20％。类似这种事例还有不少。
    各设计单位通过大搞技术革新和技术革命，解决了生产中的许多关键问题，突破了许多薄弱环节，因而设计的生产水平飞快提高，生产计划完成得很好。仅仅据建筑工程部各直属院的统计，今年1月份完成的总产值为去年同期的三点八七倍，打破了年初松，年末紧的“常规”；2月份完成的总产值又比1月份提高60％；3月上、中旬完成的总产值比2月全月完成的还多17％，设计质量也有所提高，1、2月份设计的工程，质量全部优良；同时，节约投资6.5％左右。其他各部的设计单位情况都差不多。
    中国建筑学会在今年春节以前，召开了全国工作会议，向各地学会和全体会员发出“每个人都要投入到技术革新、技术革命群众运动热潮中去”的号召。各地建筑学会都环绕当地党委的中心任务，制定了工作计划。会员们深入基本建设现场，在党委领导下，和工人群众一起，大搞发明创造，交流推广先进经验，开展学术争鸣，培养训练技术干部和技术工人，做了不少工作。例如沈阳市学会和北京市学会在建筑设计大闹技术革新、技术革命运动中都采取了组织献宝取经大会、交流经验大会的形式，把各设计单位的不同经验，相互介绍，广为传播，对运动起了推进的作用。
    总之，一年多来，全国建筑设计工作所取得的成绩是巨大的，这是党中央和毛主席英明领导的结果，是各省、市、自治区党委和各级党委大力领导与支持的结果，是全体建筑设计人员高举总路线和毛泽东思想红旗的结果。
    现在，1960年的第一季度已经过去了，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，正在提前和超额完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，夺取第二季度的开门红。这次大会又给了全国人民以极大的鼓舞，大家的干劲越来越大，创造精神越来越发扬，一片持续跃进的大好形势已经展现在我们眼前。我们建筑设计工作者，要抓住当前的大好形势，把以“五化”“六新”为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命运动更加广泛、深入地开展起来。同时，要主动配合与帮助施工和生产单位推行机械化半机械化；积极支援农业建设，为农业技术改造服务；并为组织城市人民经济生活作出贡献。我们坚信，只要紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，沿着党中央和毛主席所指引的道路前进，就能够在已有成就的基础上，实现1960年建筑设计工作更好更全面的持续跃进。
