Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to the reports from Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, we have been greatly encouraged and inspired. We would like to say a few words on the important topic of the opera community studying Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Past Decade, China's Opera Undertaking Has Shown a Vibrant Scene of Colorful Blossoms

In the past decade, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, through successive political and ideological struggles, the opera community has seen its political awareness continuously raised and its spiritual outlook fundamentally changed. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, a vast number of actors have gone up to the mountains, down to the countryside, to factories, military units, and streets, bringing performances to the doorsteps, eating, living, and laboring alongside workers, peasants, and soldiers, earnestly engaging in ideological remolding, learning the diligent and simple style of the working people, and establishing a selfless communist spirit. Many actors have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Our opera undertaking has achieved unprecedented prosperity and development, and many troupes have even traveled to major cities around the world, receiving universal welcome and appreciation from international audiences. During the great festival of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our nation, opera troupes nationwide staged many excellent plays, presenting a vibrant scene of colorful blossoms in full bloom.

The Opera Community Must Strengthen Ideological Remolding and Establish a Proletarian Worldview

Although we have achieved these accomplishments, they are still far from sufficient compared to the developing situation of society. This first requires strengthening ideological remolding and establishing a proletarian worldview. We deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the compass for doing all our work well. Only by earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works can we fundamentally transform our worldview. Therefore, our opera community must vigorously launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought.

Ideological remolding in the opera community is particularly urgent. We all come from the old society. Although we have undergone ten years of learning and have made many changes, it is still not thorough and requires continued remolding. Furthermore, we hope to improve our performances, which requires a deeper and more essential understanding of the characters and the plot. How can we achieve these goals? It is inevitable that we will need to study the life habits and thoughts and feelings of people in the past. Therefore, our remolding process is even more complex and arduous. Only by mastering dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and clarifying the class viewpoint, can we create character images that are both in line with historical reality and can play an educational role.

Get Closer to the Masses, Go Deep into Life, and Learn from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

We should also get closer to the masses, go deep into life, learn from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly familiarize ourselves with the language of the masses, and experience their lives, what the workers, peasants, and soldiers like and dislike. On the basis of what the masses love and understand, we will continuously improve the quality of our operas, playing a certain educational and inspiring role for the masses, and promoting the development of socialist construction. In order to do our work well, we put forward the following suggestions:

1.  Improve Culture. The cultural level of the opera community can be roughly divided into two categories: actors who came from old opera schools and apprentices, who, after ten years of education and training by the Party and the government, have basically eliminated illiteracy and significantly improved their cultural level; and another part are students who graduated from opera schools after liberation, who generally reach junior high school to high school level. Although we have made some achievements, we should strive to improve in order to adapt to the needs of the environment. In this way, we will have greater gains in political study and professional research.

2.  Cultivating the Next Generation and Teacher Training. For ten years, the Party has shown the greatest concern for the cultivation and nurturing of the next generation of successors, and the teachers, due to their increased awareness and selfless labor, have taught wholeheartedly. As a result, the young actors who have emerged are all excellent in character and learning, both red and expert, and are welcomed by the audience, powerfully shattering the fallacy of "the present is not as good as the past, and there is no one to succeed." However, with the development of the social situation, our opera ranks are expanding day by day, and there is a widespread and serious problem in various regions, various opera genres, and amateur troupes, that is, the shortage of teachers. As far as we know, the current situation is that almost all the old actors who can work have been employed. Therefore, we feel that while actively cultivating the next generation, we must also tap potential and train teachers in a planned way.

Inheriting Tradition Must Bring Forth the New, Making the Past Serve the Present

3.  Inherit Tradition. To inherit tradition, we must understand the principle of "bringing forth the new and making the past serve the present." We cannot blindly worship the ancients or be intimidated by them. Our opera community has produced outstanding talents like Guan Hanqing and Wang Shifu, who have left behind a rich legacy. They grew up in the feudal era and reflected the dark, chaotic, and brutal rule of the time, which had progressive significance, but also had its limitations. Today, we have even better conditions. As long as we create steadily using the viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, we have the potential to surpass our predecessors. When we are bringing forth the new, we must also pay attention not to push all the good things out together. That would not only lose the meaning of this guidance, but also show crudeness and ignorance. Therefore, this work is very meticulous and complex. We must inherit, develop, and reform it well. There are three ways to treat traditional plays:

    (1) Bad plays that cannot be modified do not need to waste energy.
    (2) For plays in which popular appeal and feudalism are intertwined, we must carefully modify them to eliminate the dross and retain the essence.
    (3) Traditional plays that are recognized as good should also be improved and refined to achieve perfection.

    In addition, we must use a historical materialist viewpoint to strive to create new historical plays, carefully select themes, and shape fresh and distinct character images to become representative works of our era.

4.  Modern Plays. Our opera was originally based on performing historical plays. In recent years, in order to praise the heroic and tenacious figures in the liberation struggle, and to promptly reflect the new people, new things, and the spirit of the times in socialist construction, various opera genres have performed modern plays. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. Some opera genres have already accumulated a lot of experience in modern plays and are performing them very well. Some opera genres are not yet proficient in the use of modern play techniques. We believe that we need to work hard to research and create in terms of costumes, makeup, music, singing, dance-like movements, and stage art. In short, the development of modern plays is undeniable, and we should all put more effort into this!

Earnestly Study Chairman Mao's Works and Resolutely and Thoroughly Oppose Revisionism

Finally, we believe that while studying Chairman Mao's works, we must also resolutely and thoroughly oppose revisionism. Revisionism also exists in the opera community. Some people use Marxism as a cover, but in essence, they are engaging in "leftist" nihilism or rightist national essence-ism, that is, everything good is absolutely good, everything bad is absolutely bad. They do not study the parts that are beneficial to the people and the parts that are harmful. They do not critically absorb the essence, and they do not seek continuous development and improvement. This is harmful to the development of opera and socialist construction. Therefore, we must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide us on how to distinguish between good and bad, beneficial and harmful, essence and dross, in order to oppose revisionism and various bourgeois viewpoints. This will allow us to stand higher, see further, and more powerfully push China's opera undertaking to new heights!

### 把我国戏曲事业推向新高潮

    把我国戏曲事业推向新高潮
    梅兰芳　周信芳　丁果仙　尹羲  沈佩华　苏育民　李再雯　陈书舫  萧长华　吴天保　郑奕奏　周惠侬  袁雪芬　俞振飞　马师曾
　常香玉  彭俐侬　邝健廉　韩世昌　韩俊卿联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们听了李富春、李先念两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的三个报告，给我们很大的鼓舞和启发，我们就戏曲界学习毛泽东思想这一重要课题，说几句话：
    十年来我国戏曲事业呈现万紫千红百花齐放景象
    十年来，戏曲界在党和毛主席的领导下，通过历次的政治斗争和思想斗争，政治觉悟日益提高，精神面貌有根本性的改变，特别是大跃进以来，广大演员上山、下乡、到工厂、部队、街头送戏上门，与工农兵同吃、同住、同劳动，认真地进行思想改造，学习了劳动人民勤劳朴素的作风，树立起忘我的共产主义风格，不少演员光荣地参加了中国共产党。我们戏曲事业得到了史无前例的繁荣、发展，有许多剧团还走遍了世界各国大城市，受到了国际观众的普遍欢迎和赞赏。在祖国建国十周年的伟大节日里，全国各剧种排演了许多优秀的剧目，呈现出万紫千红，百花齐放的蓬勃气象。
    戏曲界要加强思想改造建立无产阶级的世界观
    我们虽然有了这些成就，但是和社会发展的形势相比，做得还很不够，这就首先要求加强思想改造，建立无产阶级世界观。我们深深体会到，毛泽东思想是我们做好一切工作的指南针，只有认真学习毛主席的著作，才能从根本上改造我们的世界观，因此，我们戏曲界就必须轰轰烈烈地展开一个学习毛主席文艺思想的运动。
    戏曲界的思想改造是特别迫切的，我们都是从旧社会来的，虽然经过十年学习，有不少改变，但还不彻底，需要继续改造。再则，我们希望把戏越演越好，那就需要对人物以及剧情有更深刻、更本质的认识。我们怎样才能达到这些目的呢？不可避免地要研究古人的生活习惯和思想感情，因此，我们的改造过程就更为复杂艰巨，只有掌握住辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义，搞清楚阶级观点，才能创造出既符合历史真实，又能发挥教育作用的人物形象。
    更多地接近群众，深入生活，向工农兵学习
    我们还应该更多地接近群众，深入生活，向广大工农兵学习，彻底熟悉群众的语言，体验他们的生活，工农兵喜欢什么，不喜欢什么。在群众所爱好、理解的基础上，不断地提高我们的戏曲质量，对群众起着一定的教育和鼓舞作用，来推动社会主义建设的发展。为了做好我们的工作，提出以下几点意见：
    一、提高文化。戏曲界的文化水平，大致可分为两类，旧科班和艺徒出身的演员，十年来经过党和政府的教育、培养，基本上扫除了文盲，文化程度有了显著的提高；另一部分是解放后戏曲学校毕业出来的学生，他们一般达到初中至高中程度。我们虽然有了一些成绩，但为了适应环境需要，还应该努力提高，这样，对于政治学习，业务钻研都会有更大的收获。
    二、培养下一代和师资问题。十年来，党以最大的关怀对下一代接班人的培养、哺育，而教师们由于觉悟提高，忘我劳动地尽心教学，因而涌现出来的青年演员，都是品学兼优，红专并重，受到观众的欢迎，有力地击碎了“今不如昔、继起无人”的谬论。但随着社会形势的发展，我们戏曲队伍正在一天天扩大，各地区、各剧种以及业余剧团，都普遍存在一个严重问题，就是师资不足，据我们知道，目前的情况，凡是可以工作的老演员差不多都已就业了，所以我们感到在积极培养下一代的同时，还要发掘潜力，有计划地培养师资。
  继承传统必须推陈出新、古为今用
    三、继承传统。继承传统，必须懂得“推陈出新，古为今用”的道理，我们不能盲目崇拜古人，被古人吓倒，我们戏曲界出现过像关汉卿、王实甫那样的杰出人才，留下了丰富的遗产，他们是生长在封建时代，反映了当时黑暗、混乱的残暴统治，是有进步意义的，但也有他们的局限性，而我们今天却有了更好的条件，只要踏踏实实地用毛泽东思想的观点来进行创造，我们就有超过前人的可能。我们在推陈的时候，也要注意到不要把好的东西一齐推出去，那样不仅失去了这个指导的意义，同时也表现出粗暴与无知，因此，这个工作是非常细致复杂的。我们必须很好地继承、发展、改革。对待传统剧目有三种办法：
    （一）无法修改的坏戏，不必浪费精力。
    （二）人民性和封建性纠缠一起的戏，我们要认真地进行修改，做到去芜存菁。
    （三）公认为好戏的传统剧目，也应该进行提高和加工，达到精益求精的程度。
    另外，我们还必须用历史唯物主义观点，努力创造新的历史戏，精选题材，塑造出清新鲜明的人物形象，成为我们这一时代的代表作。
    四、现代戏问题。我们的戏曲，本来是以表演历史剧目为主的，近年来，为了歌颂在解放斗争中壮烈顽强的英雄人物；及时反映社会主义建设中的新人新事和时代面貌，各剧种都演出了现代戏，这是非常可喜的现象，有些剧种对现代戏已经积累了很多经验，演得很好，有些剧种对现代戏的技巧运用，还不太够，我们认为在服装、化装、音乐、唱腔、舞蹈化的动作，以及舞台美术等方面都需要刻苦钻研，进行创造。总之，现代戏的发展是无可置疑的，我们大家应该在这方面多加努力！
    认真地学习毛主席著作坚决、彻底地反对修正主义
    最后，我们认为在学习毛主席的著作的同时，还必须坚决地、彻底地反对修正主义。在戏曲界方面，也同样存在着修正主义。有些人以马克思主义为幌子，实质是“左”的虚无主义、右的国粹主义，就是好的绝对好，坏的绝对坏，不研究对人民有利的部分，有害的部分，不批判地吸收精华，不求不断地发展和改进。这样，对戏曲的发展，社会主义的建设，都是有危害性的。所以，必须认真地学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想来指导我们如何辨别好和坏，有利和有害，精华与糟粕，来反对修正主义和各种各样的资产阶级观点。使我们站得更高，看得更远，更有力地把我国戏曲事业推向新的高峰！
