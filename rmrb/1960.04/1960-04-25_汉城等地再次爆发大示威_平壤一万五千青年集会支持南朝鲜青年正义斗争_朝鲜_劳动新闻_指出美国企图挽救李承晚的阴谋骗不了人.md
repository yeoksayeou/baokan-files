Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th – Seoul Dispatch: The fire of the South Korean people's anger against the U.S.-Rhee fascist rule is still burning fiercely. Today, large-scale people's demonstrations erupted again in Seoul, Masan, Jeonju, and other places.

　　In Seoul, more than 500 college students demonstrated again this morning. They distributed a large number of leaflets with the following slogans: "Don't trample on human rights with bayonets!" "The government must be responsible for the Seoul massacre of April 19!" "Students' demonstrations are not atrocities!" "Put down your rifles!" "Give freedom to schools!" "Immediately stop the indefinite suspension of classes!"

　　Students in Seoul also held a memorial service in a square to mourn the students who were massacred by the Syngman Rhee clique in Seoul on April 19.

　　At noon, students held demonstrations in many parts of the city. Many citizens also joined the students' march.

　　The people of Masan, who have been subjected to bloody suppression by the Syngman Rhee clique many times, once again held a heroic demonstration against the U.S.-Rhee group today. About 1,000 people participated in the demonstration, including about 100 elderly people over the age of 50. The elderly also held up flags and banners and shouted: "Syngman Rhee get out!" "Now is the time for revolution!" "Let us have true democracy!" As they marched, thousands of people on the roadside applauded and cheered in enthusiastic support of their actions.

　　In Jeonju City in western South Korea, about 3,000 students held a demonstration in the city early this morning. They also stopped at the Jeonju Public Stadium to read out a resolution stating that they would resolutely fight to the end against the fascist terror rule of the Syngman Rhee clique.

　　Students in Jeonju also held a sit-down demonstration in front of the Jeolla Buk-do government and the police station. There, the police of the Syngman Rhee clique brutally beat the demonstrating students again. The angry demonstrators bravely fought back the police and broke into the Jeolla Buk-do government, smashing windows and furniture. The demonstration had not ended by noon.

　　It is reported that students in Gunsan City in Jeolla Buk-do and Pohang City in eastern South Korea also held demonstrations against the U.S.-Rhee group yesterday.

　　The Syngman Rhee clique continues to carry out military rule. South Korea's "Martial Law Commander" Song Yo-chan announced today that the martial law command will remain in effect under the current "state of emergency."

　　At the same time, incidents of police persecution of demonstrators continue to be exposed. According to Seoul newspapers, many students arrested by the police during and after the demonstrations were tortured. Some were beaten unconscious.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th – 15,000 young students in Pyongyang held a meeting at the Moranbong Open-Air Theater tonight to commemorate "Anti-Colonialism Day." Representatives of foreign students in Pyongyang also attended the meeting.

　　The young students participating in the meeting shouted slogans such as "U.S. imperialist aggressors get out of South Korea immediately!" "Youth and students of Asia and Africa, unite against imperialism and colonialism!"

　　Oh Hyun-joo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, spoke at the meeting. He said that the people and young students of South Korea, like the people and young students of other colonies, are enduring a life of poverty and deprivation. All their misfortunes and suffering are the result of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee. Therefore, U.S. imperialism must be driven out of South Korea immediately, the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee must be overthrown, and the new politics and new system demanded by the South Korean people must be realized.

　　He said that South Korean youth and students have launched a fiery struggle against U.S. imperialist colonial policies and the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee. Their struggle is not isolated, and is not only enthusiastically supported by the people and youth and students in the northern half of the Republic, but also supported and echoed by the peace-loving people and youth and students in Asia, Africa, and the world.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th – The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, condemning the conspiracy of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee group to deceive and paralyze the South Korean people in the face of the surging struggle of the South Korean people.

　　The commentary pointed out that the South Korean people's surging struggle against the U.S.-Rhee group has fundamentally shaken the foundation of the fascist terror rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea. In order to save this crisis, U.S. imperialism has directed the Syngman Rhee group to mobilize troops and tanks to frantically suppress the South Korean people who have risen up to fight for democracy and freedom; at the same time, in order to confuse, deceive, and paralyze the South Korean people, it is staging a clumsy farce.

　　The commentary said that Syngman Rhee's accomplice Lee Ki-poong issued a "statement" on the 23rd, saying that he would even "resign from the elected vice-presidency," "cooperate with conservative forces to reorganize political parties, and consider reforms of the political system based on a cabinet responsibility system." The commentary pointed out: Even if U.S. imperialism replaces a few of Syngman Rhee's accomplices, "reorganizes political parties," and clamors for a "cabinet responsibility system," it will not deceive anyone.

　　The commentary said that what the South Korean people are demanding through bloody struggle is the immediate abolition of the fascist ruling system of the Syngman Rhee group, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, freedom and democratic rights, and a new politics and a new system.

　　The commentary pointed out the significance of the consolidated revolutionary democratic base in northern Korea for resolving the situation in South Korea. The commentary said that in order to discuss the current situation in South Korea, "North and South Korea must consult as soon as possible and gather together to find a grand strategy to save the country."

    汉城等地再次爆发大示威
    平壤一万五千青年集会支持南朝鲜青年正义斗争
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出美国企图挽救李承晚的阴谋骗不了人
    新华社平壤24日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民反对美李法西斯统治的怒火仍在炽烈地燃烧。今天，在汉城，马山、全州等地又爆发了人民大示威。
    在汉城，五百多名高等学校的学生在今天上午再次示威游行。他们散发了大量传单，上面写着下列口号：“不要用刺刀蹂躏人权！”、“政府必须对4月19日的（汉城大屠杀）血案负责！”、“学生们示威不是暴行！”、“放下步枪！”、“给学校以自由！”、“立即停止无限期的停课！”
    汉城的学生们还在一个广场上举行了追悼大会，追悼在4月19日在汉城被李承晚集团屠杀的同学。
    中午，学生们在市内许多地方举行了示威游行。许多市民也参加了学生的游行队伍。
    曾经遭到李承晚集团多次血腥镇压的马山市人民今天再一次举行了反对美李集团的英勇示威。参加示威的有一千人左右，其中约有一百名年在五十岁以上的老人。老人们也都高举着旗帜和标语牌，并且高呼：“李承晚滚蛋！”、“现在是革命的时候了！”、“让我们有真正的民主！”。在他们游行时，路旁有数千名群众鼓掌欢呼，热烈支持他们的行动。
    在南朝鲜西部的全州市，今天一早也有三千名左右学生在市内举行了示威游行。他们还在全州公共运动场停下来宣读了一项决议，表示要坚决为反对李承晚集团的法西斯恐怖统治而斗争到底。
    全州市学生们还在全罗北道政府和警察局门前举行了静坐示威。在那里，李承晚集团的警察又野蛮地殴打了示威的学生。愤怒的示威者英勇地将警察打退，并且冲入全罗北道政府，捣毁了窗子和家具。示威游行到中午尚未结束。
    据报道，全罗北道的群山市和南朝鲜东部的浦项市的学生在昨天也举行了反对美李集团的示威。
    李承晚集团在继续进行军事统治。南朝鲜“戒严司令”宋尧赞今天宣布，在目前的“紧急状态”下，戒严会将继续有效。
    同时，警察对示威者迫害的事件续有暴露。据汉城报纸报道，在示威期间和示威以后被警察逮捕的许多学生都受到了拷打。有的人被毒打到不省人事。
    据新华社平壤24日电　平壤市一万五千名青年学生今天晚上在牡丹峰露天剧场举行大会，纪念“反殖民主义日”。各国在平壤的留学生代表也参加了大会。
    参加大会的青年学生激昂地高呼“美帝国主义侵略者立即从南朝鲜滚出去！”“反对帝国主义和殖民主义的亚非青年学生团结起来！”等口号。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长吴铉周在会上讲了话。他说，南朝鲜人民和青年学生同其他殖民地人民和青年学生一样，经受着贫穷和无权利的生活。他们的一切不幸和痛苦，都是美帝国主义侵略政策和李承晚法西斯统治的结果。所以，必须立即从南朝鲜赶走美帝国主义，必须打倒李承晚反动统治，必须实现南朝鲜人民要求的新政治、新制度。
    他说，南朝鲜青年学生为了反对美帝国主义殖民政策和李承晚法西斯统治，展开了烈火般的斗争。他们的斗争不是孤立的，不仅有共和国北半部人民和青年学生的热烈支持，而且有亚洲、非洲和全世界爱好和平的人民和青年学生的支持和声援。
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，谴责美国—李承晚集团在南朝鲜人民汹涌澎湃的斗争面前企图欺骗和麻痹南朝鲜人民的阴谋。
    评论指出，南朝鲜人民的怒涛般的反对美李集团的斗争，从根本上动摇了美帝国主义和李承晚集团在南朝鲜的法西斯恐怖统治的基础。美帝国主义为了挽救这一危机，指使李承晚集团一面调动军队和坦克，疯狂镇压为争取民主和自由而起来斗争的南朝鲜人民；一面为了迷惑、欺骗和麻痹南朝鲜人民，正在演出拙劣的丑剧。
    评论说，李承晚的帮凶李起鹏23日发表“声明”，说甚至“辞去当选的副总统职务”，“同保守势力合作来改组政党，考虑以内阁负责制为基础的政治制度的改革”。评论指出：尽管美帝国主义换掉几个李承晚的帮凶，“改组政党”，叫嚷“内阁负责制”，这也骗不了任何人。
    评论说，南朝鲜人民进行浴血斗争所要求的是立即废除李承晚集团的法西斯统治制度，要求美军从南朝鲜撤走，要求自由和民主权利，要求新政治、新制度。
    评论指出朝鲜北部巩固的革命民主基地对于解决南朝鲜局势的意义。评论说，为了讨论南朝鲜的目前局势，“南北朝鲜必须早日协商，必须聚集一堂找出救国的大策”。
