Scientific Research Work in Higher Education
Representative Yang Kaiqu Discusses the Educational Revolution at Sichuan Agricultural College

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Now, I would like to report to the conference on the achievements of Sichuan Agricultural College in implementing the Party's education policy and carrying out the educational revolution under the brilliant light of the General Line since its establishment. Since its establishment in 1956, Sichuan Agricultural College has undergone fundamental changes in all aspects through the anti-Rightist struggle, followed by a series of educational revolutions. The most important of these changes is the strengthening of the Party's comprehensive and absolute leadership over education work, and the realization of the combination of education and labor. The Party's leadership has been implemented in the fields of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor; political leadership has been realized in all work, and the Party's principles and policies have been implemented, achieving successive victories in the struggle between the two roads on the education front, thus ensuring the continuous leap forward in all work. Due to the gradual deepening of the Party's General Line and education policy and their implementation, the school has opened its doors, integrated with the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, allowing productive labor to enter the school, and integrating teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Under the leadership of the Party, the mass line has been implemented, combining teachers and students, giving play to the leading role of teachers in teaching; the political and ideological outlook of teachers and students has undergone profound changes, and the transformation of people has greatly strengthened the proletarian position in the field of teaching work, gradually correcting the direction of professional work. These changes have enabled our college to achieve rapid improvement in education quality and scientific research.

The improvement of teaching quality is mainly manifested in: (1) The rapid improvement of students' political ideology. In the past two years, through a series of political movements and productive labor, especially the experience of going down to the countryside, the vast number of students have received continuous and vivid education, gradually establishing the idea of serving the socialist and communist cause, clarifying that the road of being both Red and expert is the only correct road for young people; gradually establishing the proletarian class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and dialectical materialism viewpoint, and greatly establishing proletarian ambition, mustering full energy, developing the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and determined to climb the peak of science and culture. (2) The improvement of teaching content. Due to the vigorous exposure and criticism of bourgeois education thought and academic thought in the educational revolution, and participation in productive labor, most teachers' political direction has gradually been corrected, and their theoretical level has greatly improved. Since last year, according to the requirements of "scientific, advanced, Chinese, and mass-based," in addition to collectively collaborating with fraternal colleges and universities in the Southwest region to compile textbooks for thirteen courses, our college has newly compiled twenty-six kinds of textbooks and adapted sixteen kinds. These textbooks have implemented the Party's principles and policies, gradually unified the proletarian viewpoint with practical materials, strengthened political ideology, and embodied the policy of linking theory with practice, summarizing farmers' production experience, absorbing the latest advanced scientific achievements, and running through the dialectical materialism viewpoint. (3) The improvement of teaching methods. Through the educational revolution, teachers began to establish the idea of teaching for the sake of cultivating talents for socialist construction, and strengthened the idea of teaching for the sake of students' learning, thus trying every means to study and improve teaching methods to improve teaching effectiveness. Many teaching and research groups have brought into play collective strength, with one person taking the lead and the whole group supporting, carrying out pre-class trial lectures, inspection listening, and post-class analysis. In lectures, the analysis of theory has been strengthened, and guidance has been strengthened. Each professional course combines teaching with labor production, closely combining with the production of farms and people's communes, and appropriately organizing on-site teaching. In particular, seizing the opportunity in production, teachers and students go to the countryside to understand production, summarize experience, and conduct scientific research. In this way, teaching is closely combined with social production, teachers and students are combined, and teachers and students are combined with the masses of farmers, forming a lively and vigorous mass teaching activity that is both political and professional, both theoretical and practical, enabling students to achieve a double harvest of ideology and business.

As a result of the improvement of teaching quality, the quality of students' learning has been greatly improved. The ideological awareness of the majority of students has been increasing day by day in the struggle of the Great Revolution in Education and in the crucible of the Great Leap Forward in the countryside. They have gradually understood the relationship between personal destiny and national destiny, corrected their learning attitude, and greatly consolidated their professional ideology. Therefore, their consciousness, initiative, and enthusiasm for learning have been rapidly improved. In reading and labor, theory is linked with practice, making the knowledge they have learned comprehensive, in-depth, consolidated, and flexible, and breaking down superstitions, daring to think and daring to do, and engaging in creative inventions, achieving some achievements that even experts admire. For example, students in the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, after being sent to Shunjian People's Commune in Neijiang, quickly put out the serious disease that killed more than 200 pigs every day in the large-scale prevention and treatment of animal epidemics in nine townships, cured more than 3,000 sick pigs, and inoculated more than 20,000 pigs. In practice, they raised and studied many new problems in livestock diseases, and also received a profound education in their thinking, understanding the correctness of the Party's policy of prevention being more important than treatment, and understanding that relying on the Party's leadership and following the mass line is the guarantee for technical work to achieve results. Several fourth-year students and young teachers, together, designed a million-poultry farm and a Red and expert-type native mechanized fire pit incubator with a capacity of more than 10,000 eggs for the commune, creating excellent incubation results with large-scale incubation rates of 94.2% and 95.2%, which attracted attention throughout the province. Veterinary medicine fourth-year students, even more, emancipated their minds, overcame many difficulties, and extracted "sludge hormone" from sludge, with a curative effect of more than 90% on various diseases such as piglet white dysentery and pig enteritis, which has been promoted in some production units in 14 provinces across the country and 34 counties in Sichuan Province. As for the scores of the courses, more than 70% of the college achieved excellent results. In the Q&A, instead of simply repeating the content of the books and lectures, they used the knowledge in the books to explain practical production problems and advanced production experience, and used advanced production experience and their own practical experience to explain the theory and put forward some creative insights.

The improvement of teaching quality most powerfully proves the correctness and great power of the Party's education policy, making us who have been engaged in education work for decades deeply feel that the improvement of education quality in the past two years is very amazing, and the facts completely shattered the fallacy of some people that "too much political movement and productive labor have reduced the quality of teaching."

In scientific research, also due to the resolute implementation of the Party's General Line and education policy, a vigorous and exciting new atmosphere has emerged. In the process of educational revolution, bourgeois ideology in scientific research was sharply criticized, the Party's leadership was strengthened, mass movements were carried out on a large scale, starting from the needs of socialist construction, and combined with the actual situation of agricultural production, thus a vigorous and unprecedented leap forward situation emerged. The characteristics of our college's scientific research work in the past two years are: (1) Wide participation. In 1959, the number of participants accounted for 98.3% of all teachers and 40% of students. In 1960, teachers accounted for 100%, students accounted for 84.7%, and even farm workers and teaching assistants also participated in scientific research activities. (2) Many projects have been completed, and the quantity is large. In 1959, 89 major projects were completed, and more than 3,000 general research papers and reports were completed, which is five times the amount from the post-liberation period to 1957. The 1960 plan includes 55 major projects jointly carried out by teachers and students, 170 general projects, 1,510 projects carried out by students, and 25 projects carried out by teaching assistants, totaling 1,760 projects. (3) The speed of progress is fast. Due to the cooperation between teachers and students, and relying on the masses of farmers, the enthusiasm is high, so the progress is generally fast. For example, some teachers and students in the Department of Agronomy, under the leadership of the local prefectural and county party committees and the strong support of the people's communes, completed the soil survey of Ya'an Prefecture, which was originally planned to take three years, in just three months, and wrote the Ya'an Soil Survey Report and papers on soil improvement. In the first two months of this year, a good start was achieved, with 7 major projects and 865 general projects completed. (4) High quality. Due to the combination of theory and practice, not only have high-yield results been created, but also new contributions have been made in theory. For example, summarizing the experience of large-scale high yields of wheat and rapeseed in Pixian, Neijiang, Ya'an and other places, cultivating excellent branched wheat varieties in common wheat; selecting and breeding more than 20 varieties of high-yielding double-cropping early and late rice, and creating and modifying new pesticides, fertilizers, and veterinary drugs such as sludge hormone and ethinylestradiol injection. In the more than 3,000 papers written in 1959, many have a certain theoretical level and practical value, of which more than 20 were published in national professional magazines, and 42 were published in our college's academic journal.

The scientific research achievements of our college have not only greatly enriched and improved the quality of the teaching content, but also been directly used and promoted in production, playing a certain role in agricultural and animal husbandry production. For example, many varieties of good breeds of livestock and poultry, more than 20 varieties of good rice varieties, sludge hormone and other veterinary drugs have been widely promoted inside and outside the province and are generally welcomed by the masses. During the period of going down to the countryside, teachers and students not only cured more than 2,000 sick livestock and vaccinated more than 150,000 livestock, quickly fattened pigs and artificially inseminated more than 2,000 livestock, but also built many fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, veterinary drug factories, pig farms, and million-poultry farms for the commune, designed semi-mechanized and mechanized pig farms, printed a large number of technical materials, and carried out more than 100 mu of high-yield experimental fields in various places, all of which achieved high-yield results; In Neijiang, Ya'an and other places, large-scale pest and disease forecasting and prevention work was carried out, and the expected results were achieved. In addition, according to the regional characteristics, our college has completed the soil survey of Ya'an Prefecture, as well as the survey of wild economic plants in Erlang Mountain, Zhedo Mountain, and Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the agricultural survey of several nearby counties, and the survey of excellent varieties of poultry and livestock in several regions, all of which are published in one of our college's academic journals, "Mountain Agriculture Science," providing extremely meaningful information for the development of mountain production, scientific research, and education. At the same time, since the autumn of 1959, a farm has been established on the mountains 1,000 to 1,500 meters near our college, changing the captive-raised dairy cattle herd to grazing, which not only saves feed and labor, but also strengthens the physique of the dairy cattle, and changes the past method of dairy cattle breeding, providing a strong basis for the improvement of animal husbandry in the plateau mountain areas.

In addition, our college has cultivated a large number of new forces in the mass movement to vigorously improve teaching quality and conduct scientific research, in the struggle of the education revolution, and in collective undertakings, which is also an important achievement of implementing the Party's General Line and education policy. The role of young teachers in our college has become increasingly prominent, and they have become the backbone force in teaching, scientific research, and production work. This semester, they account for 74.5% of all teachers who give lectures. In the past, a few people who lacked confidence in young teachers gradually changed their views and actively helped young teachers improve their teaching work.

In short, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Party's General Line and education policy have achieved great victories in our college's work, shining with unparalleled brilliance, making fundamental changes in education work. However, the achievements and teaching quality we have achieved are far from meeting the requirements of the development of the situation. Therefore, we must work harder, continuously improve the political and ideological consciousness of teachers and students, correct the direction of professional work, expand the position of Mao Zedong Thought in teaching and scientific research, so that our college's education work can be guaranteed ideologically and organizationally, thereby further carrying out active and step-by-step reforms from teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, teaching material content, and teaching methods, vigorously improving teaching quality; and vigorously conducting scientific research, rapidly expanding the ranks of intellectuals of the working class who are both Red and expert, consolidating and developing the achievements of the education revolution, and striving to achieve the continuous leap forward in the cause of socialist construction.

    高等学校的科学研究工作
    杨开渠代表谈四川农学院的教育革命各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。现在就我们四川农学院在总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻党的教育方针、开展教育革命以来的成就，向大会汇报。四川农学院从1956年建院以来，经过反右斗争，继之以一系列的教育革命，在各方面都发生了根本的变化。这些变化中最主要的是党对教育工作的全面的绝对的领导加强了，实现了教育与劳动相结合。党的领导贯彻到了教学、科学研究和生产劳动的领域中；在各项工作中实现政治挂帅，贯彻执行党的方针政策，取得教育战线上两条道路的斗争的节节胜利，从而保证了一切工作的不断跃进。由于党的总路线和教育方针逐步深入人心和贯彻执行，学校打开了校门，与社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业结合起来，使生产劳动进了校门，教学、科研与生产劳动结合起来，在党的领导下，贯彻了群众路线，师生相结合，发挥了教师在教学中的主导作用；师生的政治思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，人的改造使教学工作领域中大大加强了无产阶级的阵地，逐步端正了业务工作的方向。以上这些变化，使我院在教育质量和科学研究上获得了迅速的提高。
    教学质量的提高，主要表现在：（一）学生的政治思想的迅速提高。两年以来，经过一系列的政治运动和生产劳动，特别是下放农村的锻炼，广大学生受到不断的最生动的教育，逐步树立为社会主义共产主义事业服务的思想，明确了红专道路是青年的唯一正确的道路；逐步树立起无产阶级的阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点和辩证唯物主义观点，并大立无产阶级志气，鼓足干劲，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，下定决心攀登科学文化高峰。（二）教学内容的改进。由于在教育革命中，大力揭露和批判资产阶级的教育思想、学术思想，参加生产劳动，使大多数教师政治方向逐步端正，理论水平大有提高。去年以来，根据“科学的、先进的、中国的、群众的”要求，我院除与西南区兄弟院校集体协作编写出十三门课程的教材以外，新编了教材二十六种，改编了十六种。这些教材，贯彻了党的方针政策，逐步把无产阶级观点与实际材料统一起来，加强了政治思想性，并体现了理论联系实际的方针，总结了农民生产经验，吸收最新的先进科学成果，贯穿了辩证唯物主义观点。（三）教学方法的改进。通过教育革命，教师开始树立从培养社会主义建设人材出发，加强了为学生学好而教的思想，因而千方百计钻研和改进教学方法，提高教学效果。不少教研组发挥了集体力量，一人上阵，全组支援，开展了课前试讲、检查性听课、课后分析。在讲课中加强了对理论的分析，并加强了辅导。各专业课将教学与劳动生产相结合，紧密结合农牧场和人民公社的生产，并恰当地组织现场教学。特别是抓紧生产中的时机，师生下到农村，了解生产，总结经验，进行科学研究。这样教学与社会生产紧密结合起来，教师与学生、师生与农民群众结合起来，形成了既有政治又有业务，既有理论又有实际的生动活泼的群众性教学活动，使学生获得了思想和业务的双丰收。
    由于教学质量的提高，结果是学生的学习质量的大为提高。大多数的学生在教育大革命的斗争和农村大跃进的熔炉中，思想觉悟日益提高，逐步懂得个人命运和国家命运的关系，端正了学习态度，专业思想大为巩固，因而学习的自觉性、主动性、积极性迅速提高。在读书和劳动中，理论联系实际，使所学的知识，全面、深透、巩固和灵活，并破除迷信、敢想敢做，大搞创造发明，取得一些连专家也为之叹服的成绩。如畜牧兽医系学生，下放内江顺江人民公社后，在九个乡的大规模防治兽疫工作中，使每日猪的死亡达两百余头的严重疾病迅速扑灭，治愈病猪三千余头，防疫注射二万余头。在实践中提出和研究了牲畜疾病中的许多新问题，在思想上也受到深刻的教育，领会到党所提出的防重于治的方针的正确性，懂得依靠党的领导走群众路线是技术工作取得成绩的保证。几个四年级学生和青年教师一起，又为该公社设计了百万家禽场和容蛋量万枚以上的红专型土机械化火坑孵化器，创造了大规模孵化率达94.2％和95.2％的优异孵化成绩，为全省所注目；兽医四年级学生，更解放思想，突破重重困难，从污泥中提出“污泥素”，对仔猪白痢、猪肠炎等多种疾病，疗效达90％以上，已在全国十四个省和四川省内三十四个县的一些生产单位中推广。至于课程的成绩，全院优良成绩达70％以上，在答问中，不是单纯的重复书本讲义内容，而是用书本知识阐明生产实际问题和先进生产经验，又用先进生产经验和自己的实践体会说明理论而且提出一些创造性的见解。
    教学质量的提高，最有力地证明党的教育方针的正确性及其巨大力量，使我们从事教育工作数十年的人深深地感到两年来教育质量的提高是十分惊人的，事实完全粉碎了某些人所谓“政治运动和生产劳动搞得太多了，降低了教学质量”的谬论。
    在科学研究上，也由于坚决贯彻党的总路线和教育方针，出现了蓬勃的令人兴奋的新气象。在教育革命过程中尖锐地批判了科学研究中的资产阶级思想，加强了党的领导，大搞群众运动，从社会主义的建设需要出发，与农业生产实际相结合，因而出现了前所未有的轰轰烈烈的跃进局面。两年多来我院科学研究工作的特点是：（一）参加的面很广。1959年参加人数占全体教师的98.3％，学生占40％，在1960年教师占100％，学生占84.7％，连农牧场职工和教学辅助人员也多参加了科研活动。（二）完成的项目多、数量大。1959年完成了主要课题八十九个，一般研究的论文报告三千多篇，为解放后到1957年八年间的五倍，1960年计划，包括师生合作主要课题五十五个，一般课题一百七十个，学生搞的课题一千五百一十个，教辅人员也搞了二十五个，共计一千七百六十个。（三）进展的速度快。由于师生协作，并依靠农民群众，干劲高涨，所以一般都是高速度地进展的。例如农学系部分师生在当地地委、县委的领导和人民公社的大力支援下，在短短三个月时间完成了原来计划要三年才能完成的雅安专区的土壤普查，并写出了雅安土壤普查报告及有关土壤改良的论文。今年头两个月就实现开门红，完成了主要课题七项，一般课题八百六十五项。（四）质量高。由于理论与实际的结合，既创造了高产成绩，又在理论上作出新的贡献。如总结郫县、内江、雅安等地的小麦油菜大面积的丰产经验，在普通小麦中培育出分枝小麦优良品种；选育出生长期短而产量高的双季早晚稻良种二十多个，创制和改制了污泥素乙烷雌酚注射剂等新的农药、肥料、兽药等优良成绩。1959年所写出的三千多篇论文中，不少具有一定的理论水平和实际价值，其中在全国各专业杂志上刊载的二十多篇，在我院学术刊物上发表的四十二篇。
    我院科学研究的成果，既大大丰富和提高了教材内容的质量，又直接在生产中运用和推广，对于农牧业生产起了一定的作用。如多种家畜家禽良种，二十多种水稻良种、污泥素等兽药已在省内外大量推广，为群众所普遍欢迎。在下放农村时期，师生既治愈病畜二千余头，防疫注射家畜十五万余头，快速肥育生猪和人工授精二千余头，为公社修建了许多化肥厂、农药厂、兽药厂、猪场、百万家禽场、设计半机械化和机械化猪场、大量印发了各种技术资料，在下放各地搞丰产试验田百余亩，均获得高产成绩；在内江雅安等地进行大面积病虫害预报和防治工作，均获得了预期的效果。除此之外，我院又根据地区特点，除完成了雅安专区的土壤普查外，更进行了二郎山、折多山、甘孜藏族自治州野生经济植物的普查，附近几个县的农业调查和几个地区家禽家畜的优良品种调查，均刊载在我院的学术刊物之一的“山地农业科学”上，为发展山区的生产、科学研究和教育提供了极有意义的资料。同时，从1959年秋季起，在我院附近一千到一千五百公尺的山地上，建立了农牧场，把舍饲的乳牛群，改为放牧，既节约了饲料和人工，也增强了乳牛的体质，并改变了过去对于乳牛饲养的方法，为高原山区的畜牧业的改良，提供了有力的依据。
    除此之外，我院在大力提高教学质量、大搞科学研究的群众运动中，在教育革命的斗争中，在集体事业中，成长了大批的新生力量，也是贯彻党的总路线和教育方针的一个重要成果。在我院青年教师的作用，已经愈来愈突出，他们已成为教学、科研和生产工作中的骨干力量，本学期担任讲课的即占讲课全部教师的74.5％。过去少数对青年教师缺乏信心的人逐步扭转了看法，并积极帮助青年教师改进教学工作。
    总之，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，党的总路线和教育方针，在我院工作中取得巨大的胜利，闪出无比的光辉，使教育工作出现根本的变化。但我们所取得的成就和教学质量，还远不能适应形势发展的要求。因此我们还必须加倍努力，不断提高师生的政治思想觉悟，端正业务工作方向，扩大教学科研中毛泽东思想的阵地，使我院教育工作得到思想上和组织上的保证，从而进一步从教学计划、教学大纲教材内容和教学方式等方面进行积极的有步骤的改革，大力提高教学质量；并大搞科学研究，迅速扩大工人阶级又红又专的知识分子队伍，巩固与发展教育革命的成果，为实现社会主义建设事业的持续跃进而奋斗。
    以上发言，是否有当，谨请代表批评指正。
