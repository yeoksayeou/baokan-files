Technical Revolution Forges Ahead: Achieving Increased Production Without Increasing Manpower
Representative Hu Ming Discusses Several Experiences from the Lüda City Technical Revolution

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now, I will make a speech on several issues in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Lüda City.

What did this movement demonstrate?

First, let me start with the changes in a workshop. There is an electrode workshop in the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. In the past, the steel rolling workers in this workshop relied entirely on physical strength, using tongs to feed red-hot steel bars in and out of the rolling mill. Almost everyone had burn scars on their bodies. At the same time, due to backward equipment and low efficiency, in order to increase production and meet needs, the workshop cadres, based on the old practices, requested an additional fifty workers. In November of last year, in order to overcome the contradiction of labor shortage in the production leap forward, and to change the backward situation in production, the Municipal Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, proposed to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, to vigorously carry out technical transformation within enterprises, and to realize the slogan of increasing production without increasing manpower. As soon as the Municipal Party Committee issued this call, the workshop was immediately seething. The workers said: "This time, we must carry out technical transformation, achieve mechanization, eliminate burn accidents, liberate ourselves, increase production, and realize increased production without increasing manpower." Sure enough, an intense battle began. The workers worked hard day and night, and as a result of their great efforts, mechanization was achieved, and a forward and reverse chuck was installed. The steel bars automatically fed in and out of the rolling mill, labor conditions were improved, and efficiency was increased. Other processes, such as charging the electric furnace and packaging the electrodes, were also mechanized one after another. As a result, the fifty workers that the workshop originally requested were no longer needed, and the daily production level was increased by about one time, basically meeting the current production needs.

From the above changes in a workshop, it fully shows that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a great movement with a broad mass base. The movement reflects the urgent desire of the broad masses of people to rapidly change the backward situation of "poverty and blankness"; the movement also reflects the urgent desire of the awakened people, holding high the great red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, to develop the socialist construction cause at high speed. Therefore, once the movement was launched, it spread like wildfire, sweeping through every department and every unit, forming a national revolutionary movement. The scale of the movement is just as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, "There has appeared a boiling scene like that of the Great Steel Smelting in 1958." For example, on New Year's Day this year, after the first round of fighting for mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the city held a street exhibition rally of innovation achievements. At the meeting, nearly ten thousand exhibits were displayed by the industrial, transportation, construction, aquatic products, commerce, culture and education, and health departments. This was during the coldest period of the "third nine" winter. However, the enthusiasm of the masses broke through the severe cold, and the exhibition time was extended from the original seven days to thirty-six days. The number of people who visited and studied at the exhibition reached as high as 900,000, almost equal to the entire population of Dalian City, of which more than 170,000 people were organized to explore and learn from the experience.

The movement not only came with a fierce momentum and a large scale, but also, with the development and deepening of the movement, the masses' enthusiasm became greater and greater, their wisdom became greater and greater, and their awareness became higher and higher. They engaged in production during the day and engaged in innovation at night. Many factory workers, cadres, and technical personnel simply ate in the factory and slept in the factory, vigorously carrying out mechanization and automation. The workers of the Dalian Instrument Factory said: "We want mechanization, automation, and communism, and we don't want overtime pay and bonuses." The workers of the Dalian Crane Factory said, "A hundred days of hard work is worth ten thousand years of sweetness." The workers of the Dalian Shipyard said: "Starting from scratch to turn poverty into wealth, continuous revolution turns the indigenous into the foreign, no hen can lay eggs, and automatic lines must be engaged in without mechanical processing." When the workers of the Dalian Petroleum Seventh Factory encountered difficulties in vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization and establishing satellite factories, they said: "No way, seven mouths and eight tongues; no materials, pieced together; no construction force, all hands and feet." A large number of innovation fanatics also appeared in the movement. They thought about it while eating and thought about it while sleeping. Similar new people and new things emerged one after another, everywhere.

From last year to now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Lüda City has been carried out for five months. After these five months, what problems has the mass movement explained to people? To put it together, the problem is that what some people dared not think of or had doubts about in the past has now proved to be thinkable, doable, and feasible. What are the problems in the movement? The movement raised three aspects of the problem. The first problem is that in the fourth quarter of last year, under the circumstances of continued leap forward in production, various units proposed to add more than 10,000 new employees, and in 1960, they requested to increase more than 30,000 people. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the slogan of "increasing production without increasing manpower." The method is to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, to replace heavy manual labor with mechanization and semi-mechanization, to tap potential, save manpower, improve efficiency, and solve contradictions.

Achieving increased production without increasing manpower is an intense battle. Faced with this arduous task, the people's thoughts at the time were: some had confidence, some lacked confidence, and some were skeptical. However, under the pressure of the situation, various units gradually turned to this intense battle.

The result of the battle proved that in the case of more than 50% of manual labor in the city, the slogan of achieving increased production without increasing manpower through technical innovation and technical revolution is not a fantasy, and some units can even reduce manpower while increasing production. The Dalian Chemical Building Materials Factory is a good example. This factory originally had more than 1,200 employees. Before the technical revolution, according to the needs of production growth, they requested to add more than 160 workers. However, after the technical innovation movement was launched, in just one month, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory rapidly increased from 34.6% to 67.15%. At the same time, several indigenous and foreign integrated production linkage lines were created, saving 540 labor forces. In addition to meeting the needs of their own factory, they also extracted more than 150 people to support four brother factories. The example of Dalian Port is also convincing. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, due to the surge in freight volume, Dalian Port has become a narrow strip in transportation. If you ask what tense problems make people unable to sleep, then you can bluntly answer: that is Dalian Port. Due to the tension in transportation, in 1959 alone, 290,000 people in the city supported the port in loading and unloading cargo. The above is the past situation. Now the situation in the port has changed. The first change is that they closely cooperated with the railway to vigorously carry out "cargo transportation dragon" and "passenger transportation dragon." This cooperation not only changed the past shirk responsibility relationship, but also greatly improved the port's throughput capacity. The second change is that they vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, replacing heavy manual loading and unloading labor with mechanization, semi-mechanization, foreign tools, and indigenous tools. On February 23, the entire port victoriously eliminated shoulder carrying and manual labor, ending the primitive and heavy manual labor left over from the old society. The dock workers and their families happily sang: "Technical innovation blooms, carrying poles and baskets return home, labor is light and efficient, now everyone praises the port." On March 5, they used the indigenous grab buckets they created to conduct a technical performance competition for unloading raw salt. In the past, it took more than ten hours to unload a ship containing 3,000 tons of raw salt. The performance competition unloaded a ship in less than two hours. With the above changes, the throughput completed by the port in the first quarter of this year increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year, but last year, 80,000 people in the city supported them in the first quarter, and this time, no one was needed. The above are examples of two units to illustrate the problem, and the example of the whole city can also illustrate the problem. Due to the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city, the degree of automation and semi-automation has also increased; in addition, many production automatic lines, linkage lines, and partially automatic and semi-automatic workshops and work sections have also appeared. Therefore, not only was increased production achieved without increasing manpower in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, but since September of last year, production has been rising month by month. For example, if the production in September of last year is 100, then the level in December is 123%. The first quarter of this year was also 7% higher than the fourth quarter of last year, and labor productivity has also greatly improved. The industrial sector has enthusiasm, and the commercial, cultural and educational sectors also have great enthusiasm. They also vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and achieved increased production without increasing manpower.

The second problem is that the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will inevitably promote a greater leap forward in production; and the leap forward in production will inevitably put forward more requirements for the supply of raw materials and materials, so it is very natural that some new contradictions have emerged in this regard, and contradictions have already emerged. How to solve this contradiction? In general, there are two approaches: one is to reach out to the state, acting as a handout seeker. The other is the approach of self-reliance, to not only be good at increasing the production of raw materials, but also to be good at vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution within the scope of raw materials allocated by the state, saving materials, and tapping the potential of material resources. Can self-reliance be feasible? Can technical innovation and technical revolution solve the problem? In this regard, there is also someone with confidence, someone with insufficient confidence, and someone who is skeptical.

Facts speak louder than words. Let's use facts to illustrate the problem. Recently, under the unified deployment of the Provincial Party Committee, on the one hand, the city launched a battle to seize materials; on the other hand, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, while continuing to vigorously carry out mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, is also marching towards tapping the potential of material resources. There are both a large number of battles for saving, substitution, and rational utilization, such as the Dalian Steel Plant; and there have also appeared battles for adopting new technologies and new processes, and tapping material potential. For example, the Dalian Crane Factory's continued improvement in product design may save more than 20% of the steel consumption for each crane. After the Wafangdian Rolling Bearing Factory adopts cutting-edge technology for the processing of bearing rings, it can not only shorten the process, save equipment and manpower, but also increase the utilization rate of bearing steel from more than 40% to about 80%. The reform of the diesel engine combustion chamber structure, which is a collaboration between the Dalian University of Technology and the Diesel Engine Factory, can reduce fuel consumption by 10%, increase horsepower by 20%, and extend the life of the oil nozzle without increasing any materials.

In the battle to extract treasures from material resources, vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization has great significance and unlimited prospects. The comprehensive utilization work currently underway in Lüda City includes: comprehensive utilization of coal; comprehensive utilization of petroleum and chemical waste gas, waste liquid, and waste materials; comprehensive utilization of wood; comprehensive utilization of seawater; comprehensive utilization of aquatic product processing; comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline product processing; and comprehensive utilization of urban waste products and waste materials. Among the various comprehensive utilization works, the comprehensive utilization of coal and coal gasification are currently being vigorously carried out. According to the principle of combining learning and originality, in the work of extracting treasures from "black gold," both advanced and cutting-edge "dry distillation before the furnace" experimental work is carried out, and simple dry distillation furnaces of various models are also established. In terms of coal gasification work, there are the Innovation No. 1 furnace of the Gas Company, as well as various styles of coal gas furnaces that are simpler and adapt to various requirements, such as those of the Locomotive Factory, the Glass Factory, and the Fuzhouwan Ceramics Factory. With the further development of coal gasification and comprehensive utilization of coal, not only will important products such as fertilizers, diesel, carbon black, crude benzene, and phenol be recovered and processed from the coal that was burned in the past, but one day it will be realized that workers can wear white clothes in the old forging workshop, and one day the ideal of eliminating a large amount of smoke and ash in the city will be realized. The comprehensive utilization of seawater also has great development prospects. The Piziwo Chemical Factory has already done a lot of work in this regard. They extract important products such as potassium chloride, bromine, and hydrochloric acid from the bittern after salt drying. In street industries, comprehensive utilization has also been greatly developed. They are not only good at utilizing urban waste products and waste materials, but recently, the employees of the Zhongshan District Hardware Handicraft Cooperative have also used shells and other materials from the seaside to make colorful, vivid shell carvings, so that shells that have not been noticed in the past have actually become useful treasures. The potential for comprehensive utilization is infinite. It is precisely by grasping this point that the Petroleum Seventh Factory has vigorously carried out mass research work and established a large number of satellite factories. In a short period of time, they have developed more than 50 new products, so that in the first quarter, under the condition of insufficient crude oil supply, they also overfulfilled the plan. The Dalian Chemical Plant also grasped this point and vigorously launched a mass movement, so that they completed the first quarter plan 22 days ahead of schedule with a small increase in raw materials, and the output value of comprehensively utilized products accounted for about 30% of the total output value.

The third problem is that with the in-depth development of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, it will not only promote a greater leap forward in production, but also accelerate the high speed of enterprise technical transformation and the high speed of the development of science and technology.

Slogans such as "completing a year's plan in a hundred days" and "climbing the peak of science and technology" are no longer slogans of individual units and individual departments, but have become the battle slogans of the broad masses. Can the high speed of enterprise technical transformation be accelerated? Can the high speed of the development of science and technology be accelerated? How to achieve high speed? In this regard, there are also opposing ideas.

When many enterprises are conducting a great debate on whether enterprise technical transformation can be achieved at high speed, the focus of the debate is on what policy to adopt, whether it is a one-legged walking policy or a two-legged walking policy that combines indigenous and foreign methods. Some people approve of rapidly changing the backward departments within enterprises, but the way out and methods they seek in their minds are to adopt foreign methods, rather than adopt indigenous and foreign combined methods. As a result, the foreign conditions are not available, so they have to wait passively and put the transformation plan on hold. Another approach is the indigenous and foreign combined approach welcomed by the broad masses. According to this approach, foreign methods are used whenever possible, and indigenous methods or indigenous and foreign combined methods are used when foreign methods are not possible. They are self-reliant and take a positive attitude, thereby accelerating the high speed of technical transformation. For example, Lu Shenghe, a model worker of the Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory, after visiting and learning about the automatic machine tool with program control, he thought it was very good, but under the condition of tension in materials such as wires and electrical control, it is not easy to promote it universally. What to do? Lu Shenghe did not adopt a passive waiting approach, but was self-reliant and actively studied. As a result, he created a semi-automatic machine tool that does not use electrical control but uses mechanical and pneumatic control. Similar practices to Lu Shenghe's have also appeared in large numbers in other enterprises. Therefore, this is a practice that is worth advocating and promoting. The transformation of a machine tool is like this, and the transformation of a workshop is also like this. For example, the screw and nut workshop of the Dalian Standard Parts Factory has old equipment. However, with the assistance of the University of Technology, they adopted indigenous and foreign combined methods and, after ten days of hard work, actually turned it into a semi-automatic workshop. Adopting the approach of combining indigenous and foreign methods, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, "Within the scope of an enterprise, the policy of self-reliance can be effectively implemented to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, equipment, and technical strength." The report also pointed out that adopting this policy "…not only mobilized the enthusiasm of people with relatively high technical levels, but also mobilized the enthusiasm of people with relatively low technical levels and even no technology." All of these powerfully prove that as long as the correct policy is adopted, it is entirely possible to promote the high speed of enterprise technical transformation.

On the issue of accelerating the development of science and technology, the opposing idea encountered is the superstitious idea of worshiping authority and worshiping foreign equipment. Some people with this idea believe that: "General production departments can engage in mass movements, but places with a relatively high degree of automation cannot engage in mass movements." They also believe that: "General technology can engage in mass movements, but high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge technology is not possible." According to their statement, modern enterprises and high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge technology are like tiger's butts that cannot be touched. The essence of this idea is the world view of cowards and lazy people who do not believe in the masses and do not believe in the subjective initiative of people. However, the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are exactly the opposite of them. The masses not only dare to innovate and revolutionize in general technical departments, but also dare to innovate and revolutionize in modern enterprises, and also dare to climb the peak of science and technology. For example, the synthetic ammonia system of the Dalian Chemical Plant was considered to be fixed in the past and has a history of more than 40 years in the world, and cannot be easily moved. However, the staff and workers armed with Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, they are not afraid of authority, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do. They formed a three-way combination group, and tried every means to find ways to increase production. Finally, they found a way out, and carried out a series of transformations on those foreign equipment, so that the production capacity increased by 25% to 40% respectively.

In order to promote the high speed of the development of science and technology, at present, many enterprises, they let go and mobilize, vigorously carry out mass scientific research work, and at the same time, three-way combination groups are universally established inside and outside the city, and battles are carried out in a planned way. For example, the Petroleum Seventh Factory, they have both professional research institutes and mass-organized research institutes and dozens of research institutes and stations, and are marching towards science and technology in a vigorous manner. Dalian University of Technology, Maritime University, Petroleum Research Institute and other units also sent more than 2,000 students, professors, and researchers to form three-way combination groups with enterprise employees to conduct battles. Their slogans are: "Protracted war for cutting-edge technology, assault war for key problems, movement war for general problems, and blitzkrieg for sesame problems."

Five months of experience have proved that after adopting the above practices, things have not been made worse. On the contrary, not only has it promoted a greater leap forward in production, but it has also promoted the high speed of technical transformation and the high speed of the development of science and technology.

Learning is the fundamental guarantee of victory

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement with a broad mass base is exerting great power. The most fundamental reason why the movement can exert such great power is that the combination of revolutionary theory, Mao Zedong Thought, and the broad masses has produced a huge material force. This force is powerfully promoting the development of production and promoting technological progress. Therefore, in order to make the movement continue to develop healthily, we resolutely implement the instructions of Vice Premier Li Fuchun in his report to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements; resolutely implement the instructions in the report that "the technical innovation and technical revolution movement should be combined with the movement of studying Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works that is widely carried out throughout the country, so that the movement has the guidance of correct thought." "The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future."

In the past five months, although we have grasped a lot of work, there are still shortcomings in grasping the work insufficiently and not deeply enough, such as the issue of constantly summarizing the experiences of the masses, the issue of studying how to reform certain aspects of the superstructure and production relations to adapt to the development of productive forces, and other issues. However, we are determined to correct shortcomings, maintain progress, and strive to, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the great red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and win a comprehensive bumper harvest in the ideological revolution, technical revolution, cultural revolution, and production leap forward.

Please correct any improprieties in the above speech.

    技术革命向前进　实现增产不增人
    胡明代表谈旅大市技术革命的几点经验主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告。现在我就旅大市的技术革新和技术革命运动中的若干问题作一发言。
    这次运动说明了什么？
    首先我从一个车间的变化谈起。大连机车车辆厂有一个电焊条车间。这个车间的轧钢工人，过去在生产中全凭体力，钳着火红的钢条，在轧钢机上穿进穿出。他们每个人身上几乎都有着烫伤的痕疤。同时还由于设备落后、效率低，要提高生产、满足需要，车间干部根据过去的老做法，要求再增加五十名工人。去年11月，为着克服生产跃进中劳动力紧张的矛盾，为着改变生产中的落后面貌，市委根据辽宁省委的指示精神，提出大搞技术革新、技术革命，大力进行企业内部的技术改造，实现增产不增人的口号。市委号召一经发出，车间内部顿时沸腾起来。工人们说：“这次一定要进行技术改造，实现机械化，消灭烫伤事故，解放自己，提高生产，实现增产不增人”。果然，一场紧张的战斗开始了。工人们日夜苦战，大干一场的结果，实现了机械化，装上了反正围盘。钢条在轧钢机上自动的穿进穿出，劳动条件改善了，效率提高了。其它工序如电炉上料、焊条包装也都先后实现了机械化。这样一来，车间原来要求增加的五十名工人也不要了，日产水平却提高了一倍左右，基本上满足了当前生产的需要。
    从上述一个车间的变化中，充分说明了技术革新、技术革命运动是具有广泛群众基础的伟大运动。运动反映了广大人民群众要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的落后面貌的迫切愿望；运动也反映着提高了觉悟的人民群众，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大红旗，要求高速度地发展社会主义建设事业的迫切愿望。因而，运动一经发动，就势如燎原，席卷每一个部门，每一个单位，形成全民性的革命运动。运动的规模正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的“出现了像1958年大炼钢铁时候那样的沸腾景象”。如今年元旦，全市在进行了第一回合的机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化的战斗之后，举行一次革新成就的大展览、大表演的马路展览大会。会上由工业、交通、基建、水产、商业、文教、卫生等部门，展出了近万件展品。这时正是三九寒冬，气候最冷的时候。但是群众的热劲，冲破了严寒，展出的时间由原来的七天一直延长到三十六天。到展览会参观学习的人次高达九十万，几与全大连市的人口相等，其中有组织地进行探宝取经的就有十七万多人次。
    运动不但来势猛、规模大，而且随着运动的发展和深入，群众的劲头愈来愈大，智慧愈来愈多、觉悟愈来愈高。他们白天搞生产，晚上闹革新。许多工厂的工人、干部、技术人员干脆吃在工厂、睡在工厂，大搞机械化、自动化。大连仪表厂的工人说：“我们要机械化、自动化、共产主义，就是不要加班费和超额奖”。大连起重机厂的工人说“百日辛苦万年甜”。大连造船厂的工人说：“白手起家穷变富，不断革命土变洋，没有母鸡要下蛋，没有机械加工要搞自动线”。大连石油七厂的工人在大搞综合利用，建立卫星厂遇到困难时说：“没有办法，七嘴八舌；没有材料，七拼八凑；没有施工力量，七手八脚”。运动中还出现了大量的革新迷。他们吃饭也在想，睡觉也在想。类似这样的新人新事，层出不穷，到处都是。
    从去年到现在，旅大市的技术革新、技术革命运动已经开展了五个月了。经过这五个月的时间，群众运动向人们说明了些什么问题呢？说明的问题集中起来说是一条，过去某些人所不敢想的或是有怀疑的问题，现在证明是可以想、可以做，而且是行得通的。运动中有哪些问题呢？运动中提出了三方面的问题首先一个问题是，在去年第四季度，生产出现继续跃进的情况下，各单位提出要求新增职工一万多人，1960年则要求增加三万人以上。市委根据省委的指示精神提出“增产不增人”的口号，办法就是大搞技术革新和技术革命，以机械化、半机械化代替笨重手工劳动，挖掘潜力、节省人力、提高效率、解决矛盾。
    实现增产不增人，这是一场紧张的战斗。在这艰巨的战斗任务的面前，当时人们的思想是：有人有信心，有人信心不足，有人则将信将疑。但在形势的逼迫下，各单位都陆续转入这一紧张的战斗。
    战斗的结果证明，在全市手工劳动占50％以上的情况下，通过技术革新、技术革命，实现增产不增人这一口号并不是空想，甚至有的单位增了产还可以减人。大连化工建材厂就是一个很好的例子。这个厂原有职工一千二百多人，在技术革命以前，根据生产增长的需要，他们要求新增工人一百六十多名。但在技术革新运动掀起以后，仅用一个月的时间，全厂的机械化半机械化程度由34.6％，迅速提高到67.15％，同时还创造了几条土洋结合的生产联动线，节约了五百四十名劳动力。他们节约的劳动力除满足本厂需要外，还抽出一百五十多人支援了四个兄弟工厂。大连海港的例子，也是有说服力的。从1958年大跃进以来，由于货运量激增，大连港就成为运输方面一条狭窄地带了。如果问有哪些紧张问题使人睡不着觉，那么，可以干脆地回答说：那就是大连海港。由于运输紧张，在1959年这一年，全市有二十九万人次支援海港装卸过货物。以上是过去的情况。现在海港的情况却变了样了。第一个变样，是他们和铁路密切协作，大搞“货运一条龙”，“客运一条龙”。这一协作，不但改变了过去的扯皮关系，而且还大大提高了港口通过能力。第二个变样，是他们大搞技术革新和技术革命，以机械化、半机械化，以洋工具、土工具代替笨重的手工装卸劳动。在2月23日这一天，全港胜利地消灭了肩扛人抬，结束了旧社会遗留下来的原始的笨重手工劳动。码头工人和他们的家属高兴地歌颂道：“技术革新开红花，扁担大筐回老家，劳动轻快效率高，如今海港人人夸”。在3月5日，他们以自己创造的土抓斗，进行卸原盐的技术表演赛，过去卸一条装有三千吨原盐的轮船，需要十多小时，表演赛不到两小时就卸完一条船。有了上述的变化，今年一季度海港完成的吞吐量比去年同期提高40％以上，可是去年一季，全市有八万人次支援他们，这一次就一个也不要了。以上是以两个单位的例子来说明问题，以全市的例子也可以说明问题。由于全市机械化、半机械化程度不断提高，自动化、半自动化的程度也有增长；此外还出现不少生产自动线、联动线以及部分自动、半自动化的车间和工段。因而不但去年第四季度和今年第一季度，实现了增产不增人，而且从去年9月以来，生产月月上升，如以去年9月的生产为一百，则12月份的水平为123％。今年一季度又比去年第四季度提高了7％，劳动生产率也有了极大的提高。工业部门有干劲，商业、文教等部门干劲也不小，他们也同样大搞技术革新、技术革命，实现了增产不增人。
    第二个问题，技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展，势必促进生产的更大跃进；而生产跃进，又势必对于原料和材料的供应方面提出更多的要求，因而在这一方面出现一些新的矛盾，这是很自然的，而且也已经出现了矛盾。如何解决这一矛盾呢？一般的存在两种做法：一种是伸手向国家要，当伸手派。另一种是自力更生的做法，做到既要善于增产原料、材料，又要善于就国家所分配的原料、材料范围内，大搞技术革新和技术革命，节约用料，挖掘物质资源的潜力。究竟自力更生能否行得通？技术革新、技术革命能否解决问题？对此，也同样存在着有人有信心，有人信心不足，有人将信将疑。
    事实胜于雄辩。我们还是用事实来说明问题吧。最近全市在省委的统一部署下，一方面展开了一场夺材大战；另一方面技术革新与技术革命运动，在继续大搞机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化同时，还向着挖掘物质资源的潜力进军。这里既有着大量的节约代用，合理利用的战斗，如像大连钢厂等；同时也出现了采用新技术、新工艺，挖掘物资潜力的战斗。如像大连起重机厂，在产品设计方面的继续改进，有可能使每台起重机钢材的消耗再节省20％以上。瓦房店滚珠轴承厂，对轴承套加工，采用尖端工艺以后，不但可以缩短工序，节省设备和人力，而且还可以使轴承钢的利用率由40％多提高到80％左右。大连工学院和柴油机厂合作的柴油机燃烧室结构的改革，可以不增加什么材料，使耗油率降低10％，马力增大20％，而且还可以延长油咀的寿命。
    在向物质资源取宝的战斗中，大搞综合利用有着巨大的意义和无限的前途。现在旅大市正在进行的综合利用的工作：有煤的综合利用；有石油、化工废气、废液、废料的综合利用；有木材的综合利用；有海水的综合利用；有水产品加工的综合利用；有农副产品加工的综合利用；还有城市废品、废料的综合利用等。在各种综合利用的工作中，目前正在继续大搞煤的综合利用和煤气化的工作。根据学习和独创相结合的原则，群众在向“乌金”取宝的工作中，既进行高级尖端的“炉前干馏”的试验工作，还建立了简易的、各种型号的干馏炉子。在煤气化工作方面，有煤气公司的革新号炉子，还有更简易的机车厂、玻璃厂和复州湾陶瓷厂等各种式样、适应各种要求的煤气炉等。随着煤气化和煤的综合利用工作进一步开展，不但从过去烧掉的煤炭中，回收并加工出化肥、柴油、炭黑、粗苯、酚等重要产品，而且终有一天会实现在老的锻造车间内穿起白衣服工作，也终有一天会实现消灭城市上空大量烟、灰的理想。海水的综合利用也极有发展前途。皮子窝化工厂在这一方面已经做了不少工作。他们从晒盐后的苦滷中提取氯化钾、溴素、盐酸等重要产品。在街道工业中，综合利用也得到很大发展，他们不但善于利用城市的废品废料，最近还由中山区五金手工艺社的职工们利用海边的贝壳等，制成了五彩夺目生动活泼的贝雕艺术品，使一向不被人注意的贝壳也居然变成有用的财宝了。综合利用的潜力是无穷的。石油七厂正是抓住这一条，大搞群众性的研究工作，办起大量的卫星厂，在短短的时间内就搞出五十多种新产品，从而一季度在原油供应不足的情况下，他们也超额完成了计划。大连化工厂也抓住这一条，大搞群众运动，因而他们在原料、材料增加不多的情况下，提前二十二天完成了第一季度计划，在总产值中综合利用的产品产值就占30％左右。
    第三个问题，随着群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展，不但要促进生产的更大跃进，同时也必将加快企业技术改造的高速度，加快科学技术事业发展的高速度。
    诸如“一年规划百日完”，“攀登科学技术高峰”的口号，已经不是个别单位，个别部门的口号，而成为广大群众的战斗口号了。究竟能否加快企业技术改造的高速度？能否加快科学技术事业发展的高速度？如何高速度？在这一方面也同样存在着对立面的思想。
    许多企业在进行企业技术改造能否高速度的大辩论时，其争论的焦点在于究竟采用什么方针的问题，是一条腿走路的方针呢？还是土洋结合两条腿走路的方针？有的人赞成快速度的改变企业内部的落后部门，但他们脑子里所企求的出路和办法是采用洋的办法，而不是采用土洋结合的办法，其结果是洋的条件不具备，只好消极等待，将改造规划束之高阁了。另一种做法是广大群众所欢迎的土洋结合的做法，按照这种做法，凡能洋则洋，不能洋则土或土洋结合。他们自力更生，采取积极的态度，从而加快了技术改造的高速度。如像工矿车辆厂的劳动模范芦盛和，当他参观和学习了程序控制的自动化机床后，他认为好是很好，但是在电线、电气控制等材料紧张的情况下，要普遍推广是不容易的。怎么办呢？芦盛和不是采取消极等待的办法，而是自力更生，积极钻研，结果创造了一台不用电器控制而用机械与气动控制的半自动化机床。其他企业也大量地出现类似芦盛和的做法。因而这是值得提倡和推广的做法。一个床子的改造如此，一个车间的改造也是如此。如像大连标准件厂的螺钉螺帽车间设备都是老的。但他们在工学院协助下采用土洋结合的办法，苦战十来天之后，居然也变成了半自动化车间了。采用土洋并举的办法，正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的那样，“就可以在一个企业的范围内有效地执行自力更生为主的方针，来克服原料、材料、设备和技术力量不足的困难”。在报告中又指出，采用这个方针“……不仅调动了技术水平比较高的人们的积极性，而且调动了技术水平比较低以至没有技术的人们的积极性”。以上这些，有力地证明了只要采取正确的方针，完全可以促进企业技术改造的高速度。
    在加快科学技术事业发展的问题上，遇到对立面的思想是崇拜权威、崇拜洋设备的迷信思想。抱有这种思想的某些人认为：“一般的生产部门可以搞群众运动，自动化程度比较高的地方就不能搞群众运动”。他们还认为：“一般的技术可以搞群众运动，高、大、精、尖的技术就不行了”。根据他们的说法，现代化企业和高、大、精、尖的技术就像老虎屁股一样摸不得的。这种思想的实质就是不相信群众，不相信人的主观能动性作用的懦夫、懒汉的世界观。但是以毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众正和他们相反。群众不但敢于在一般的技术部门中革新、革命，而且也敢于在现代化企业中革新、革命，同时也敢于攀登科学技术的高峰。如像大连化工厂的合成氨系统，过去被人认为是定了型的，世界上已有四十多年的历史，不可以轻举妄动的。但是以毛主席的不断革命思想武装起来的职工群众，他们不怕权威，破除迷信、敢想敢干，他们组成三结合小组，千方百计寻找增产的途径，最后终于找到出路，对那些洋设备进行了一系列的改造，使生产能力分别提高25％至40％以上。
    为着促进科学技术事业发展的高速度，目前有许多企业，他们放手发动，大搞群众性的科学研究工作，同时全市又普遍地成立厂内外三结合小组，有计划地进行战斗。如像石油七厂，他们既有专业的研究所，又有群众自己组织的研究院和数十个研究所与站，轰轰烈烈向科学技术大进军。大连工学院、海运学院、石油研究所等单位，也派出二千多名学生、教授、研究员与企业职工组成三结合小组，进行战斗。他们的口号是：“尖端技术持久战，关键问题突击战，普遍问题运动战，芝麻问题速决战”。
    五个月来的经验证明，采用上述做法之后，并没有把事情搞坏了，相反地不但促进了生产的更大跃进，同时也促进了技术改造的高速度和科学技术事业发展的高速度。
    学习是胜利的根本保证
    具有广泛群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在发挥着巨大的威力。运动所以能够发挥这样巨大的威力，最根本的原因，是由于革命理论、毛泽东思想和广大群众相结合的结果，产生了巨大的物质力量，这个力量正在有力地推动着生产的发展，推动着技术的进步。因而要使运动不断地健康地向前发展，我们坚决贯彻李富春副总理在报告中所指出的要坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的指示；坚决贯彻报告中所指出的“技术革新和技术革命运动应当同目前在全国各地广泛开展的学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，使运动有正确思想的指导”。“毛泽东思想的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜。认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证”。
    五个月来，我们虽然抓了不少工作，但仍然存在着对工作抓得不够和不深不透的缺点，如像不断地总结群众经验的问题，研究上层建筑和生产关系的某些方面如何进行改革，以适应生产力的发展的问题，以及其他问题等。但，我们决心改正缺点，保持进步，力争在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大红旗，夺取思想革命、技术革命、文化革命、生产跃进的全面大丰收。
    以上发言如有不妥之处，请大会指正。
