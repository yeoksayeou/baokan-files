    Homecoming
    Painting by Yuan Hao
    Poetry by Du Chengen
    Long Away from Home, Yearning to Return
    My heart is like an arrow,
    Suddenly I look up,
    A myriad of feelings arise:
    The motherland's benevolent ship
    Rides the wind and waves to continuous success,
    The red flag waves with a whistle,
    Anchoring at Tanjung Priok.
    This is a new chapter in history,
    This is the banner of the Mao Zedong era!
    Return,
    Over vast misty waves, wind and rain,
    Freely traversing the seven continents mid-stream,
    Heading towards the motherland's tomorrow.

    Long Away from Home, Yearning to Return
    My heart is like an arrow,
    Suddenly I look up,
    A myriad of feelings arise:
    There's no place like home,
    Great leaps forward year after year,
    Harvests year after year!
    Return,
    Return,
    Without hesitation,
    Without lingering.
    A message to all relatives and friends,
    Tomorrow, where we will miss each other,
    Is in front of Tiananmen Square.
    —In Indonesia

    归心
    袁浩画
    杜承恩诗
    久客怀归
    心似箭，
    蓦抬头，
    兴万千：
    祖国慈航
    乘风破浪来蝉联，
    红旗招展一声笛，
    泊停丹绒不碌。
    这是历史新篇，
    这是毛泽东时代的旌旃！
    归吧，
    万顷烟波风和雨，
    中流自在过七洲，
    朝向祖国的明天。
    久客怀归
    心似箭，
    蓦抬头，
    兴万千：
    异乡不若家乡好，
    跃进年年，
    丰收年年！
    归吧，
    归吧，
    不犹豫，
    不流连。
    寄语诸亲友，
    明日相思处，
    在天安门前。
