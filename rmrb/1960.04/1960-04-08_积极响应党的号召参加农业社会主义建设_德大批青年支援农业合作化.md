    Actively Responding to the Party's Call to Participate in Socialist Agricultural Construction
    Large Number of Young People in East Germany Support Agricultural Cooperativization
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th – To meet the needs of the rapidly developing agricultural cooperativization movement, a large number of urban youth in the German Democratic Republic are actively responding to the call of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to go to the countryside and participate in socialist agricultural construction.
    The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, in accordance with the spirit of the Socialist Unity Party's call, issued a call requiring 10,000 outstanding young men and women to go to fully cooperativized villages before May 31st to work as livestock breeders or agricultural technicians. The call stated that socialist construction is progressing rapidly in the countryside, and at this time, it is a glorious task for young people to use their own hands to build a socialist countryside.
    The call of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League was quickly responded to by youth league organizations at all levels, and various districts have put forward plans to select and send league members and young people to the countryside. The Neubrandenburg district plans to send 3,000 outstanding league members to the countryside before May 31st to participate in livestock breeding.
    The Magdeburg, Cottbus, Halle, Dresden and other districts have also formulated their own plans. Eighty young men and women from Bitterfeld County in the Halle district and fifty young people from the Dresden district have already gone to work in agricultural production cooperatives.
    Currently, preparations are also underway to open training courses to help young people participating in agricultural production learn relevant knowledge.

    积极响应党的号召参加农业社会主义建设
    德大批青年支援农业合作化
    新华社柏林7日电　为了适应农业合作化运动迅速开展的新形势的需要，德意志民主共和国大批城市青年正积极响应德国统一社会党发出的到农村去参加农业社会主义建设的号召。
    自由德国青年联盟中央根据统一社会党号召的精神而发出了号召书，要求在5月31日之前有一万名优秀男女青年到已经全部合作化的乡村去当牲畜饲养员或农业技工。号召书说，社会主义建设在农村中正在迅速进展，在这个时候，青年们用自己的双手去建设社会主义农村是一个光荣的任务。
    自由德国青年联盟中央的号召迅速得到青年联盟各级组织的响应，各个专区都纷纷提出选派盟员和青年下乡的计划。新勃兰登堡专区准备在5月31日以前派遣三千名优秀的青年联盟盟员到农村去参加牲畜饲养工作。
    马格德堡、科特布斯、哈雷、德累斯顿等专区也都分别订出了自己的计划。哈雷专区比特菲尔德县的八十名男女青年和德累斯顿专区的五十名青年已经到农业生产合作社去工作。
    目前，各地还筹备开办训练班，帮助参加农业生产的青年学习一些有关知识。
