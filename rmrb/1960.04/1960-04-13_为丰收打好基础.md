    Laying a Solid Foundation for a Bumper Harvest

    Without a solid foundation, you can't build a tall building; without good sowing, you can't get a bigger harvest. Planting more and planting well are essential for high yields and abundant harvests.
    Shandong Province has put forward a very resounding slogan in the spring sowing work: "Get all the seedlings in one go." This slogan grasps the most crucial issue in sowing work. Rational close planting is the central link in striving for a bumper harvest. Only by achieving rational close planting can we achieve high yields. Appropriately increasing the seeding rate is an important factor in achieving rational close planting, but it is not the only factor. Other conditions, such as sowing time, soil moisture, base fertilizer, land leveling, and seed germination rate, will all have an effect and influence on close planting. Shandong's requirement of "getting all the seedlings in one go" grasps the main key in sowing. By grasping this key, we can comprehensively solve all the problems of ensuring sowing quality and rational close planting.
    This slogan is also excellent because of the requirement of "once." Getting all the seedlings in one go is the central link in ensuring the completion of sowing work in a faster, better, and more economical way. Achieving "one-time" full seedling establishment can ensure timely sowing of crops and avoid the waste caused by replanting and reseeding, greatly saving manpower and material resources. As the saying goes, "A good seedling is worth a thousand gold," and that's the reason.
    Some people say that planting crops is not embroidery, and there will always be seedling shortages and broken ridges. Therefore, there is the saying that "seedlings will not be complete without replanting." In the past, this was indeed an unavoidable phenomenon. In the era of the individual economy, with poor seeds, lack of water and fertilizer, and insufficient labor, how could seedling shortages and broken ridges not occur? Now, in the era of the people's commune, the situation is very different. Things that could not be avoided in the past can be avoided, and things that could not be done in the past can be done on a large scale. Let's still take sowing work as an example. In the past few years, especially after the Great Leap Forward and communization, the basic conditions for ensuring sowing quality—the condition of water, fertilizer, and soil—have been greatly improved. The cultivation and propagation of improved varieties have also made great achievements. The tool reform movement has given us many useful sowing tools, and the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture has enriched our farming experience. In particular, the people's commune can rationally use its strong human and material resources to carry out various production activities without missing the farming season. These are all favorable conditions for achieving one-time sowing and one-time full seedling establishment. As long as we summon greater revolutionary vigor, emancipate our minds, and break the old viewpoint of "no full seedlings without checking and replanting" left over from the small-peasant economy, we can improve the quality of sowing and achieve full seedling establishment with one sowing.
    Shandong Province has already set an example for us in this regard, and their experience deserves attention.

### 为丰收打好基础

    为丰收打好基础
    没有坚实的基础，盖不起高大的楼房；没有良好的播种，得不到更大的丰收。种得多，种得好，才能产量高、收得多。
    山东省在春播工作中提出了一个很响亮的口号：“一次拿全苗”。这个口号抓住了播种工作中最关键的问题。合理密植是争取丰收的中心环节，做到了合理密植，才能达到高产。适当增加播种量是达到合理密植的重要因素，但并不是唯一的因素，其它方面的条件如播种时间、墒情、底肥和平整土地的状况、种子发芽率的高低等等，对密植都会发生作用和影响。山东提出“一次拿全苗”的要求，就把播种中的主要关键抓住了。抓住了这个关键，就可以把一切保证播种质量、保证合理密植的问题，全面地加以解决。
    这个口号所以非常好，还在于“一次”这个要求上。一次拿全苗是保证多快好省地完成播种工作的中心环节，作到了“一次”全苗，就可以使作物适时下种，就可以避免复种和补种所造成的浪费，大大节约人力、物力。农谚说“千金难买一茬苗”，道理就在这里。
    有人说种庄稼不是绣花，总会有缺苗断垅的现象发生，因而有“苗不补不齐”的说法。在过去，这的确是难以避免的现象。在个体经济时代，种子差、水肥缺、劳力不足，怎么可能不发生缺苗断垅的事情呢？现在，在人民公社的时代里，情况大不相同了，过去不能避免的事情可以避免了，过去办不到的事情可以大办特办了。仍旧拿播种工作来说吧，几年来，特别是大跃进、公社化以后，保证播种质量的基础条件：水、肥、土的状况大大改善了，良种的培育和繁殖也有很大的成绩，工具改革运动使我们有了很多的播种利器，八字宪法的贯彻又丰富了我们的耕作经验，特别是人民公社能够合理使用自己强大的人力、物力资源，不误农时地进行各种生产活动，这些都是实现一次播种、一次拿全苗的有利条件。只要我们鼓起更大的革命干劲，解放思想，打破小农经济遗留下来的“不查不补不会全苗”的老观点，我们就能提高播种质量，作到一次播种拿全苗。
    山东省在这方面已经为我们做出了榜样，他们的经验值得重视。
