Short Commentary:

    Last year in the fourth quarter, various regions achieved great results in the large-scale pig raising and manure accumulation campaign, focusing on breeding. According to statistics from the agricultural departments, approximately 20 million sows were pregnant. If we assume an average of six piglets per sow (the actual number is certainly higher), over 100 million piglets will be added in succession soon, leading to a new major development in the pig farming industry.

    The large-scale development of the pig farming industry has also brought many new problems and new contradictions. Actively and correctly resolving these new problems and new contradictions is the key to continuously advancing the pig farming industry. Any revolutionary cause always progresses by constantly resolving contradictions. Taking pig farming as an example, in order to further resolve the contradiction between the national people's need for meat and agricultural production's need for fertilizer, we must raise a large number of pigs; after the large-scale development of the pig farming industry, this contradiction is resolved, but new contradictions arise: labor shortage, feed shortage, etc. Labor shortage must be solved by vigorously reforming breeding tools, and feed shortage must be solved by establishing new feed bases and expanding feed sources. Of course, solving the feed problem well so that all pigs have high-quality and sufficient feed is a major issue. From now until May, although summer harvesting has begun in areas where the season is earlier, most areas are still experiencing a period of relative shortage of pig feed. What to do? Not fearing difficulties is the great character of the Chinese working people. As long as we are determined to develop pig production with lofty ambitions, make full use of the various favorable conditions of the people's communes, and use the same energy as we did last winter in vigorously raising pigs and focusing on breeding, to vigorously develop feed production, the difficulties can be completely overcome. In fact, many places and many communes have already solved the spring feed problem, and Wangyue Commune in Hunan is one of them.

    The most important reason why Wangyue Commune can solve the feed problem so well is that they can make comprehensive arrangements for the feed problem based on the new situation of the high-speed development of the pig farming industry, and seize the planting and storage of feed early. At the end of last year, this commune had more than 50,000 pigs, and by February of this year, it had increased by 11,000, and it is expected to increase to 70,000 by May. After practical arrangements, they not only ensured that each pig had enough feed, but also had a surplus. It can be seen that the feed problem can be completely solved even in the spring when the old crop has been used up and the new crop has not yet been harvested. The problem is that there needs to be a spirit of hard work, a correct leadership and measures.

    Arranging feed production requires both long-term plans and consideration of current needs; both determining the planting area and arranging feed types; this is another good experience of Wangyue Commune in solving the feed problem. They focused on planting, especially the planting of high-yield and early-maturing feed, and also focused on the processing and manufacturing of agricultural and sideline products. At the same time, they seized the management of spring and winter planted feed crops and mobilized the masses to make a concentrated effort to collect wild feed. These are all good ways to solve the current shortage of feed.

    If more than 100 million piglets are well raised and managed, they will also have a great effect on the continued leap forward in the pig farming industry next year, because a large number of gilts can be bred at the end of this year or early next year, and after half a year, a large number of piglets will be born again. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that newborn piglets have sufficient feed and to ensure that all piglets are born alive, survive, and grow strong. This is a key to the great leap forward in the pig farming industry this year and next year, and we must and are able to do it well as soon as possible.

### 为大量小猪备足饲料

    为大量小猪备足饲料
    去年第四季度各地在大规模的养猪积肥运动中，大抓配种，成绩很好，据农业部门统计，大约有二千万头左右的母猪怀孕。如果以每头母猪平均生小猪六头计（实际上当然不止此数），最近将陆续增加一亿多头小猪，养猪事业将有新的大发展。
    养猪事业的大发展也带来了许多新问题和新矛盾。积极正确地解决这些新问题新矛盾，是不断推进养猪事业的关键。任何革命事业，总是在不断解决矛盾中前进的。以养猪为例，为了进一步解决全国人民对肉食的需要和农业生产对肥料的需要的矛盾，就要大量养猪；养猪业大发展以后，这个矛盾解决了，但又产生了新的矛盾：劳力不足、饲料缺乏等等。劳力不足要靠大搞饲养工具改革来解决，饲料不足则靠建立新的饲料基地和广辟饲料来源来解决。当然，解决好饲料问题，使全部猪只都有质好量足的饲料是个主要的问题。从目前到5月，虽然季节较早的地区已经开始夏收，大部分地区还处在猪饲料比较短缺的时候。怎么办呢？不怕困难是我国劳动人民的伟大性格，只要我们抱定发展养猪生产的雄心大志，充分运用人民公社的各种有利条件，用去年冬天大搞养猪、大抓配种的劲头，来大办饲料，困难就完全能够克服。事实上有好些地方好多公社已经解决了春季饲料问题，湖南望岳公社就是其中的一个。
    望岳公社所以能够很好解决饲料问题，最主要的是他们能够根据养猪事业高速度发展的新情况，对饲料问题作了全面安排，早抓饲料的种植和贮备。这个公社去年底有五万多头猪，到今年2月增加了一万一千头，到5月预计可增加到七万头。经过切实安排，他们不仅保证了每头猪有足够的饲料，并且还有多余。可见，饲料问题即使在青黄不接的春天也是完全能够解决的，问题是需要有一股干劲，有一个正确的领导和措施。
    安排饲料生产，既要有长年的计划，又要照顾到当前的需要；既要确定种植面积，还要安排饲料种类；这是望岳公社解决饲料问题的又一个好经验。他们抓了种植，特别是高产早熟饲料的种植，也抓了农副产品加工制造，同时抓住春冬种的饲料作物管理和发动群众突击采集野生饲料。这些都是解决当前饲料不足的好办法。
    一亿多头小猪如果饲养管理得好，对明年养猪业继续跃进也有很大作用，因为大量的小母猪可以在今年年底或明年初配种，半年之后又会出生大批小猪。因此，必须保证新生小猪有充足的饲料，保证小猪全生全活全壮，是关系到今年和明年养猪事业大跃进的一个关键，我们必须而且也有条件及早把它做好。
