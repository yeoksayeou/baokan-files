Innovation Good News

    Ultra-Shortwave Wireless Telephone
    The ultra-shortwave wireless telephone successfully trial-produced by the staff of the Pingyao Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Shanxi Province using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods can be used for communication or telephone conferences within a short distance of one hundred li. This type of telephone is easy to maintain and operate, has a low manufacturing cost (only about 720 yuan), is easy to move, and can save investment in laying lines.
    The call quality of this ultra-shortwave wireless telephone is no lower than that of ordinary wired telephones. If it is further improved in the future and a carrier wave machine is added, it will be possible to open up more call paths.

    Xu Yongji Has New Creations Again
    Xu Yongji, a nationally renowned advanced producer and young female technician at the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute, has recently made two new creations. These are the "Serrated Variable Curvature Hyperbolic Paraboloid Shell" and the "No-Tension Brick Shell Rapid Calculation Method." Using the "Serrated Variable Curvature Hyperbolic Paraboloid Shell" to build factory roofs can save 25% of steel and 15% of cement. The "No-Tension Brick Shell Rapid Calculation Method" can increase design efficiency by more than 20 times.

    Rotating Pen for Drawing Topographic Maps
    Yang Hanxiang, a young draftsman and member of the Communist Youth League at the Survey Company of the Wuhan Metallurgical Design Institute, has successfully developed a rotating pen for drawing symbols on topographic maps.
    This symbol rotating pen can draw symbols for earth dikes, slopes, boundaries, railways, paths, etc., flexibly and freely. It can improve efficiency by 66 times compared to drawing stroke by stroke by hand in the past, and the drawn graphics are clear, accurate, and beautiful.

    Automatic Drill Rig Moving Tractor
    Hou Zhongxiao, a member of the Communist Youth League of Team 194 of the Coalfield Geological Exploration Department of the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Fuel Industry, recently successfully trial-produced an automatic moving tractor. Using this tractor to move drilling rigs can increase work efficiency by more than 10 times, freeing drilling workers from heavy physical labor and speeding up the moving of drilling rigs.

    Automated Steel Grit Cutting Machine Tool
    The repair shop of the Qilian Mountain Geological Team of the Qinghai Provincial Geological Bureau has made an automated steel grit cutting machine tool.
    Steel grit is a sharp weapon used to attack hard rocks under the drill bit. In the past, the steel grit used by the Qilian Mountain Geological Team was cut from waste steel pipes by workers in the repair shop, which was both laborious and inefficient. Now, with the automated steel grit cutting machine tool, as long as the waste steel pipe is placed on the machine and the switch controlling the machine tool is turned on, three kilograms of steel grit can be cut out in one hour. The work efficiency is 100 to 200 times higher than manual operation in the past.

    Electric Bricklaying Machine
    Chen Shilin, a mason and member of the Communist Youth League of the Guizhou Fourth Construction Engineering Company, has successfully created an electric bricklaying machine after more than two months of painstaking research. This electric bricklaying machine has been proven to have good performance and high efficiency in on-site use. Three people can lay more than 36,400 bricks in eight hours, which is equivalent to the amount of manual bricklaying by thirteen people in the same amount of time. At the same time, the brick walls built are beautiful and solid, and fully meet the quality specifications.

    Electronic Automatic Grain Dispenser
    Shan Jingfeng and three other salespersons at the Tangshan City District Grain Station have made an electronic automatic grain dispenser. This electronic automatic grain dispenser has been installed at the Xinhua Road Grain Station in Tangshan City. After it is used in conjunction with the electric moving and mixing vehicle, lifting machine, and bag sweeping machine created by Shan Jingfeng, the grain station's grain transportation, unloading, and payment work will all be automated. When selling grain, the salesperson flicks a switch, and the grain automatically flows out from the designated grain outlet according to the amount sold. It can pay three or four kinds of grain in different quantities to two customers per minute, and the payment efficiency is more than 20 times higher than using a scale.

    Commodity Pricing Calculator
    Ma Zhaorui, a staff member of the Price Section of the Anshan City Knitwear and Textile Company, broke the ideological constraint that "commodity pricing cannot be done without an abacus" during the technical innovation movement. After repeated research, he created a "simple pricing calculator."
    This calculator is suitable for pricing commodities such as silk, towels, socks, vests, and undershirts. It takes only three seconds to calculate the wholesale and retail prices of a batch of silk with this calculator, which is more than eight times more efficient than in the past and can eliminate calculation errors.

    革新喜报
    超短波无线电话机
    山西省平遥邮电局职工用土洋结合办法试制成功的超短波无线电话机，可以在一百华里的近距离内通话或召开电话会议。这种电话机的维护、操作都很简便，制造成本低（只要七百二十元左右），移动方便，并可节省架设线路的投资。
    这种超短波无线电话机的通话质量不低于普通实线电话。今后继续加以改进，加装上载波机，就可以开辟比较多的话路路数。
    徐永基又有新创造
    闻名全国的先进生产者、西北工业建筑设计院女青年技术员徐永基，最近又有两项新创造。这就是“锯齿形变曲率双曲薄壳”和“无拉力砖薄壳快速计算法”。用“锯齿形变曲率曲薄壳”建筑厂房屋面，可节省百分之二十五的钢材，百分之十五的水泥。“无拉力砖薄壳快速计算法”，可提高设计工效二十多倍。
    绘地形图的轮转笔
    武汉黑色冶金设计院勘察公司青年绘图员、共青团员杨汉祥研究成功绘地形图用的符号轮转笔。
    这种符号轮转笔能绘制土堤、斜坡、地界、铁路、小径等符号，灵活自如，比过去用手一笔一笔的勾画，可提高效率六十六倍，而且绘出的图形清晰、精确、美观。
    钻机自动搬运牵引机
    青海省燃料工业局煤田地质勘探处一九四队共青团员侯忠孝，最近试制成功一种自动搬运牵引机。用这种牵引机搬运钻机，提高工效十倍以上，解除了钻探工人笨重的体力劳动，加快了钻机搬家速度。
    自动化切钢粒机床
    青海省地质局祁连山地质队修配车间制成自动化切钢粒机床。
    钢粒是被用来放在钻头下向坚硬岩石进攻的利器。过去，祁连山地质队用的钢粒，都是由修配车间的工人用废钢管切割的，既费力，效率又低。现在有了自动化切钢粒机床，只要把废钢管放在机器上，开动控制机床的电门以后，一个小时就能切出三公斤钢粒。工作效率比过去手工操作提高一、二百倍。
    电动砌砖墙机
    贵州第四建筑工程公司泥工、共青团员陈仕林，经过两个多月的苦心钻研，创造成功一台电动砌砖墙机。这台电动砌砖墙机经现场使用证明，性能良好，工效很高。三人操作，八小时能砌砖三万六千四百多块，相当于十三人在同时间内的手工砌砖量。同时，砌出的砖墙美观坚实，完全合乎质量规格。
    电子自动售粮器
    唐山市区粮站单景峰等四位营业员，制成一台电子自动售粮器。这台电子自动售粮器，已安装在唐山市新华路粮站。它和单景峰创造的电动搬捣车、升降机、扫面袋机配套使用以后，粮站的运粮、倒粮、付粮工作就全部实现了自动化。售粮时，营业员一扳电钮，粮食就从指定的出粮口按售量自动流出，每分钟就能付给两个顾客不同数量的三、四种粮食，付粮效率比用秤提高二十倍以上。商品作价计算器
    鞍山市针棉纺织品公司物价科工作人员马兆瑞在技术革新运动中，打破了“商品作价离不了算盘”的思想束缚，经过反复钻研，创造了一台“简易作价计算器”。
    这个计算器适合对绸缎、毛巾、袜子、背心、汗衫等商品作价。用这种计算器算一次绸缎批、零价格，只要三秒钟，比过去提高效率八倍多，并可消灭计算差错事故。
