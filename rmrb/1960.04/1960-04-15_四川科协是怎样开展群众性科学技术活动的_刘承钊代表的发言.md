I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and will resolutely implement them in future work.

Now, I will give a brief speech on the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association's activities in carrying out mass science and technology activities.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people of Sichuan Province, after two years of hard work, have victoriously completed and overfulfilled the main tasks assigned to Sichuan Province in the Second Five-Year Plan. With the rapid development of national economic construction, the cause of science and technology has also seen a great leap forward, and mass science and technology activities have become unprecedentedly active, with one upsurge following another. This is a great victory under the leadership of the Party in earnestly implementing the "walking on two legs" policy for science and technology work!

Before the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some people only saw the role of professional scientific and technological research institutions, underestimating or failing to see the role of mass scientific and technological activities. After the Party called for liberating thought, breaking superstitions, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, a trend of science for the whole people emerged. The broad masses of workers and peasants were invigorated, full of spirit, and actively engaged in mass scientific and technological activities. Advanced production experiences and inventions directly from the workers and peasants blossomed like spring flowers, powerfully promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and contributing to the development of science and technology. This fact powerfully criticized the erroneous thinking of underestimating the role of mass scientific and technological activities.

In the past year, science and technology associations at all levels in Sichuan Province have played their role as a tool and assistant of the Party in organizing and promoting mass science and technology activities.

First, mass scientific experiment and research activities have been carried out in close combination with key production issues. According to incomplete statistics from the Luzhou City Science and Technology Association, 1,814 projects were realized through mass scientific experiments and research, solving more than 450 key production problems. This not only enabled many factories to realize semi-mechanized production combining indigenous and foreign methods from manual operations, but also created many high-yield records in agriculture. The average yield per mu of wheat in the Luohan Commune alone increased by 34.8% compared to 1958. The results of mass scientific experiments and research have also powerfully refuted the "theory" of sterility in distant hybridization put forward by bourgeois scientists. In crops, rice and sorghum hybridization, and rapeseed and pea hybridization, were not only successful but also produced offspring. In animal husbandry, cattle and pig hybridization, and sheep and pig hybridization, produced "cattle-essence pigs" and "sheep-essence pigs." This has opened up new avenues for cultivating new varieties of crops and livestock. The "Technology Survey" initiated by the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association is an even more suitable scientific and technological activity for the broad masses to participate in. Through the "Technology Survey," advanced production experiences and mass inventions are effectively summarized and promoted in a timely manner, enabling them to blossom everywhere and bear fruit everywhere. The Yingshan County Science and Technology Association, in coordination with relevant departments, adopted the method of going deep into the grassroots, relying on the masses, comprehensively understanding, and focusing on sorting out, and collected and summarized the advanced production experiences and mass inventions that have emerged in industrial and agricultural production in Yingshan County over the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward. In addition to compiling more than 30 kinds of materials, they were also widely promoted through newspapers and periodicals inside and outside the province. A total of 14 provinces (cities) and 46 counties (cities) in the province sent letters and telegrams requesting relevant materials. This provided broad, fast, precise, and accurate information for industrial and agricultural production, thereby promoting industrial and agricultural production. Popular science propaganda, due to the direct participation of the broad masses of workers and peasants, has changed the past situation in which a small number of scientific and technological workers carried out popular science propaganda to the masses, and has therefore been carried out more extensively and deeply. In many places, a moving scene of "technology is promoted everywhere, everyone learns technology, and technology is implemented in production" has emerged. Carrying out spare-time technical education has also become an important part of mass scientific and technological activities. Science and technology associations at all levels in Sichuan Province have mostly adopted the mass line method of using local materials, those who are able becoming teachers, everyone being a teacher, and everyone being a student, and vigorously carrying out spare-time technical education work in different professions, cultivating a large number of technical personnel for factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes. For example, the Zigong City Zhangjiaba Chemical Plant Science and Technology Association, under the leadership of the factory Party committee, has trained more than 700 skilled workers, some of whom have assumed the work of technicians or assistant technicians. The forms of carrying out spare-time technical education are also diverse. For example, the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory Science and Technology Association has adopted forms such as professional trade training classes, technical drills, technical service teams, various technical schools, and radio clubs, organizing more than 8,000 mass technical learning activities throughout the factory, which has generally improved the technical level of workers. In 1959, more than 5,300 people broke through 3,358 key production issues, which played an important role in the factory completing its annual production tasks 105 days ahead of schedule. Before the first national congress of members of the China Association for Science and Technology, the academic activities of various specialized societies were mostly limited to a small number of intellectuals and experts. Now it is different. The broad masses of workers and peasants, especially worker-peasant inventors and innovation experts, directly participate in the academic activities of various specialized societies, thereby fundamentally changing the nature of the societies and prompting the academic activities of the societies to be more closely linked with production practice and the broad masses. The various specialized societies under the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association have also undergone this change, carrying out a series of activities facing production, facing the grassroots, and facing the masses. For example, since the third quarter of 1959, various specialized societies in Chongqing have organized 407 academic activities such as academic seminars, academic report meetings, and experience exchange forums. The Medical Association also organized medical academic lecture groups to conduct lectures in districts and counties, held a city-wide medical red and expert university, and published two academic journals. The academic activities of various specialized societies in the Chengdu area are also very active. They have successively organized rice technology inspection teams and water conservancy technology inspection teams to conduct technical inspections in key areas of the province. In addition, academic animal husbandry symposiums were held in Wusheng County, and academic on-site meetings on soil-heated bed cultivation of sweet potato seedlings were held in Xichong County, summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of these areas in a timely manner. All these academic activities have implemented the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and the academic atmosphere is extremely strong.

In these mass scientific and technological activities, the broad masses of workers and peasants are the most active participants. According to statistics from the Yingshan County Science and Technology Association, in 1959 alone, 24,508 workers and peasants in the county were engaged in scientific and technological activities. Not only that, but the broad masses of workers and peasants have also demonstrated high wisdom and ability in scientific and technological activities, making great contributions to the cause of science and technology. For example, Zhang Mingde of Shangxia Commune in Xuanhan County, based on the characteristics of opposite leaves of corn, created the "oriented close planting method of corn," which can plant 6,000 plants per mu. After the county promoted this method and earnestly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, the yield per mu of 40,000 mu of dryland corn increased from 541 jin to 1,025 jin, of which 19,000 mu exceeded 1,500 jin. Chen Zhilun of Dongfeng Commune in Meishan County has cultivated 21 new varieties of crops in recent years, including wheat with more than 120 grains per ear, and corn with 7-8 cobs per plant and a yield of about 2 jin. The above examples show that the scientific and technological activities of the broad masses are not only effective but also have extremely strong vitality, forming a great situation of science for the whole people. Therefore, mass scientific and technological activities have become an indispensable part of developing socialist science and technology in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This is the concrete application of the Party's mass line in scientific and technological work.

Based on the experience of the past year, the establishment of people's communes and their great superiority provide extremely favorable conditions for carrying out mass scientific and technological activities extensively, and open up infinitely broad roads for science for the whole people. Here, I will only take one commune as an example to illustrate. The Luohan Commune in Luzhou City was formed in September 1958 by merging two townships and one town, and sixteen advanced agricultural cooperatives. Soon after the establishment of the commune, a science and technology association and a scientific research institute were established, and mass scientific and technological activities developed vigorously. As many as 138 projects have been successfully researched and tested, and there are 61 worker-peasant inventors and innovation experts with remarkable achievements in this area. Why has the mass scientific and technological activity of this commune been able to develop from small to large and achieve remarkable results? First of all, because the people's commune implements unified leadership, has a large organizational scale, and has a wide range of activities, it can concentrate the use of manpower and material resources. Things that agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past can now be done by the people's communes; problems that agricultural cooperatives could not solve in the past can now be solved by the people's communes. For example, the largest agricultural cooperative—Guanghui Cooperative—once ran a spare-time technical school, but it was shut down after only two months because of weak leadership and the inability of students to afford teacher subsidies. However, as soon as the commune was established, each management district ran red and expert technical schools, with more than 1,700 people participating in the study, and a large number of technical talents were trained. Secondly, the people's commune implements a distribution system that combines the supply system with communist elements and the wage system, and runs various collective welfare undertakings, so that the ideological burden of worrying about food and clothing for the broad masses of peasants for thousands of years can be relieved. This not only provides a material guarantee for the masses to participate in scientific and technological activities, but also greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of the masses. There is a female member of Qiancheng Brigade named He Zhongying, who was enthusiastic about scientific experiment and research activities when she was in the agricultural cooperative, but because she undertook heavy housework every day, it was impossible to allocate more time. After the establishment of the commune, the family of 14 ate in the public canteen, and four children entered kindergartens and nurseries. Eight laborers participated in the production and work of the commune, and they could receive an average monthly salary of 55 yuan, an increase of 68.6% compared with the income before the establishment of the commune. Therefore, she was light and fast. In less than a year, she and other commune members conducted high-yield experiments on 38 mu of wheat, rice, sweet potato, corn, sorghum, sugar cane and other crops, and promoted six advanced production technologies such as "warm bed seedling raising". She also learned how to manufacture a variety of indigenous fertilizers and indigenous pesticides. Thirdly, the people's commune is not only a grassroots social organization integrating workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, but also a production unit that develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in an all-round way. This has opened up a vast world for mass scientific and technological activities. Commune member Wang Zhizhong is a skilled nurseryman for three generations. Because the original agricultural cooperative did not operate fruit trees in batches, his expertise could not be brought into play. After the establishment of the commune, he successfully experimented and researched more than 20 new technologies for cultivating forest and fruit trees in the commune's horticultural farm in less than a year. Due to the above reasons, more than 2,300 activists who can often participate in scientific and technological activities in the entire commune account for 25% of the total labor force, creating a situation in which science is for production and production uses science in the entire commune.

In carrying out mass scientific and technological activities, the most profound feeling we have is that we must ensure the leadership of the Party and implement politics in command. Now, Party committees at all levels have universally strengthened their leadership over scientific and technological work in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions. Most of the science and technology associations at all levels in Sichuan Province are personally led by the Party secretary or relevant responsible comrades at the same level, who take charge of and lead the work. They not only grasp ideological education, but also grasp the political direction and business direction of the work. They not only grasp key production issues and organize mass scientific and technological activities in a timely manner, but also grasp the soundness and development of the organization, and constantly strengthen the scientific and technological team. In terms of leadership methods, they generally adopt the "six unifications": unified leadership, unified deployment, unified reporting, unified inspection, unified summary, and unified evaluation. This provides a fundamental guarantee for the widespread and in-depth development of mass scientific and technological activities.

In order to highly develop social productive forces and build our country into a powerful socialist country, one of the prerequisites is to develop our country's scientific and technological undertakings at high speed. To develop our country's scientific and technological undertakings at high speed, we must not only give full play to the role of professional scientific and technological research institutions, but also carry out mass scientific and technological activities in a vigorous manner, vigorously promote science by the whole people, and combine the two, promote each other, and improve together. At present, a nationwide movement of technological innovation and technological revolution based on tool reform and centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation is developing with the force of a landslide and a tsunami. We must carry out mass scientific and technological activities more extensively to serve the continued great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production!

    四川科协是怎样开展群众性科学技术活动的
    刘承钊代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念副总理向大会所作的报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我仅就四川省科学技术协会开展群众性科学技术活动的情况作一简要发言。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，四川省全省人民经过两年的奋战，已经胜利地完成和超额完成了国家给予四川省第二个五年计划的主要任务。随着国民经济建设的飞跃发展，科学技术事业也出现了一个大跃进的局面，群众性科学技术活动也空前地活跃，风起云涌，一个高潮接着一个高潮。这是在党的领导下，认真贯彻科学技术工作的“两条腿走路”的方针的伟大胜利！
    1958年大跃进以前，有些人只看到专业的科学技术研究机构的作用，小看或者看不到群众性科学技术活动的作用。在党号召解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格以后，出现了全民办科学的苗头，广大工农群众精神振奋，意气风发，积极投入群众性的科学技术活动中去，直接从工农群众中产生的先进生产经验和创造发明，有如春花怒放，万紫千红，有力地推动了工农业生产的发展，并对科学技术的发展作出了贡献。这一事实有力地批判了轻视群众性科学技术活动作用的错误思想。
    一年来，四川省各级科学技术协会在组织和推动群众性科学技术活动中，发挥了作为党的一个工具和助手的作用。
    首先，紧密结合生产关键，开展了群众性的科学试验研究活动。据泸州市科协不完全的统计，通过群众性科学试验研究实现的项目就有一千八百一十四个，解决生产关键问题四百五十多个，不仅使很多工厂由手工操作实现了土洋结合的半机械化生产，而且在农业方面创造了不少的高产纪录，单是罗汉公社的小麦平均亩产量，就比1958年增长了34.8％。群众性的科学试验研究的成果，还有力地驳倒了资产阶级科学家所谓远缘杂交不孕的“学说”。作物方面的水稻和高粱杂交，油菜和豌豆杂交，不仅获得了成功，而且有了后代；畜牧方面的牛与猪杂交，羊与猪杂交，生出了牛精猪和羊精猪。这就为培育作物和畜牧方面的新品种开辟了新的途径。由四川省科协发起的“技术采风”，更是一个适合广大群众参加的科学技术活动。通过“技术采风”，有效地把先进生产经验和群众的创造发明及时总结推广出去，使其遍地开花，到处结果。营山县科协配合有关部门，采取深入基层、依靠群众、全面了解、重点整理的办法，将营山县十年来、特别是大跃进以来在工农业生产方面所出现的先进生产经验和群众的创造发明加以搜集和总结，除汇编成资料三十多种，并通过省内外报刊加以普遍地推广，共有十四个省（市）和省内四十六个县（市）来信来电索取有关资料。这就广、快、精、准地为工农业生产提供了情报，从而推动了工农业生产。科学技术普及宣传，由于广大工农群众的直接参加，改变了过去由少数科学技术工作者向群众作普及宣传的局面，因而开展得更加广泛和更加深入了。在很多地方出现了“处处宣传技术，人人学习技术，生产贯彻技术”的动人情景。开展业余技术教育，也成为群众性的科学技术活动重要内容之一。四川省各级科协大都采取了就地取材，能者为师，大家当先生，大家当学生的群众路线的方法，大力开展不同专业的业余技术教育工作，为厂矿企业和人民公社培养了大量的技术人材。如自贡市张家坝化工厂科协，就在厂党委的领导下培养了七百多名技术工人，其中有的已担负了技术员或助理技术员的工作。开展业余技术教育的形式也是多种多样的，如成都量具刃具厂科协就采取了专业工种训练班，技术大练兵、技术服务队、各种技术学校，以及无线电俱乐部等形式，在全厂组织了八千多次的群众性的技术学习，较普遍地提高了工人的技术水平。在1959年就有五千三百多人突破生产关键三千三百五十八项，对于全厂提前一百零五天完成全年的生产任务起了重要的作用。在全国科协第一次会员代表大会以前，各专门学会的学术活动大多局限在少数知识分子专家的范围内，现在则不同了，广大工农群众，特别是工农发明家和革新能手直接参加了各专门学会的学术活动，从而根本改变了学会的性质，促使学会的学术活动更紧密地与生产实际和广大群众联系起来。四川省科协所属的各专门学会也起了这种变化，面向生产，面向基层、面向群众开展了一系列的活动，如重庆市各专门学会从1959年第三季度到现在，就组织了学术讨论会、学术报告会、经验交流座谈会等学术活动四百零七次，医学会还组织了医药学术讲学团到区、县进行讲学，举办了全市性的医药红专大学和出版了两种学术刊物。成都地区各专门学会的学术活动也很活跃，曾先后组织了水稻技术考察团和水利技术考察团深入省内重点地区进行技术考察，此外，还在武胜县召开了学术性畜牧座谈会，在西充县召开了学术性土温床育红苕苗现场会，及时地总结推广了这些地区的先进经验。所有这些学术活动，都贯彻了党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，学术空气极为浓郁。
    在这些群众性的科学技术活动中，广大工农群众是最积极的参加者。据营山县科协的统计，仅在1959年，全县从事科学技术活动的工农群众就达二万四千五百零八人。不仅如此，广大工农群众还在科学技术活动中发挥了高度的智慧和能力，对科学技术事业作出了巨大的贡献。如宣汉县上峡公社张明德，根据玉米叶子对生的特点，创造了“玉米定向密植法”，每亩可种六千棵。全县推广了这种方法并认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”以后，四万亩旱地玉米亩产由五百四十一斤提高到一千零二十五斤，其中有一万九千亩超过了一千五百斤。眉山县东风公社陈志伦，几年来培育出二十一种农作物新品种，其中有每穗多达一百二十多粒的小麦，每株长七、八包，产量达两斤左右的玉米。从以上事例说明，广大群众的科学技术活动，不仅作用显著，而且具有极其旺盛的生命力，形成了全民办科学大好形势。因而群众性的科学技术活动，便成为多快好省地发展社会主义的科学技术的不可缺少的组成部分，这是党的群众路线在科学技术工作中的具体运用。
    根据一年来的体会。人民公社的建立及其巨大的优越性，为广泛地开展群众性的科学技术活动，为全民办科学提供了极为有利的条件。并开辟了无限广阔的道路。这里，我只举一个公社为例加以说明。泸州市罗汉公社是在1958年9月由原两乡一镇，十六个高级农业社组成的。公社成立以后不久，就建立了科学技术协会和科学研究所，群众性的科学技术活动得到了蓬蓬勃勃的发展，单是科学试验研究获得成功的项目就达一百三十八个，在这方面有显著成绩的工农发明家和革新能手就有六十一人。为什么这个公社的群众性科学技术活动能够由小到大地发展起来，并取得显著的成绩呢？首先是由于人民公社实行统一领导，组织规模大，活动范围广，能够集中使用人力、物力，过去农业社不能办的事，现在人民公社办到了；过去农业社不能解决的问题，现在人民公社解决了。例如原最大的一个农业社——光辉社，曾办了一所业余技术学校，终因领导力量薄弱，学员不能负担教师的补助工分，只有两个月的时间就停办了。但公社一成立，各管区都办了红专技术学校，参加学习的就有一千七百多人，培养出大批的技术人材。其次，人民公社实行具有共产主义因素的供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度，并举办了各种集体福利事业，使几千年来广大农民愁吃愁穿的思想负担得以解除，这就不仅为群众参加科学技术活动提供了物质保证，而且大大地激发了群众的积极性。前程大队有一个女社员叫何仲英，在农业社时就热心于科学试验研究活动，但因每天承担着繁重的家务劳动，不可能分出更多的时间。公社成立以后，全家十四口人在公共食堂吃饭，四个孩子进了幼儿园和托儿所，八个劳动力都参加了社里的生产和工作，平均每月可领工资五十五元，比公社成立前的收入增加了68.6％。因而她一身轻快，不到一年的时间，就同其他社员在一起，进行了三十八亩小麦、水稻、红苕、玉米、高粱、甘蔗等作物的高产试验，推广了“温床育苗”等六种先进生产技术，自己并学会了制造多种土化肥和土农药的方法。再其次，人民公社既是工农商学兵五位一体的社会基层组织，又是农林牧副渔全面发展的生产单位，这就为群众性的科学技术活动开辟了广阔的天地。社员王志忠是一个祖传三代的培育树苗的能手，因原农业社没有成批经营果木，他的专长不能发挥。公社成立后，他在公社园艺场不到一年，就试验研究成功了二十多项培育林木果树的新技术。由于以上原因，全公社能够经常参加科学技术活动的积极分子就有二千三百多人，占了总劳动力的25％，在全公社造成了一个科学为生产，生产用科学的局面。
    在开展群众性科学技术活动中，我们感受最深的一点是必须保证党的领导和实行政治挂帅。现在各级党委根据毛主席指示的精神，普遍地加强了对科学技术工作的领导。四川省的各级科协组织，绝大部分都是由同级党委书记或有关负责同志亲自挂帅，具体领导。既抓思想教育，又抓工作的政治方向和业务方向，既抓生产关键，及时组织群众性的科学技术活动，又抓组织的健全和发展，不断壮大科学技术队伍。在领导方法上，一般都采取了“六统一”：统一领导、统一布置、统一汇报、统一检查、统一总结、统一评比。这就为群众性的科学技术活动广泛深入地开展提供了根本的保证。
    为了高度地发展社会生产力，把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，其前提条件之一就是要高速度地发展我国的科学技术事业。要高速度地发展我国的科学技术事业，既要充分发挥专业的科学技术研究机构的作用，又要轰轰烈烈地开展群众性的科学技术活动，大搞全民办科协并使两者结合起来，互相促进，共同提高。目前，一个以工具改革为基础的，以机械化和半机械化，自动化和半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的全民运动，正以排山倒海之势向前发展，我们必须更广泛地开展群众性的科学技术活动，为工农业生产的继续大跃进服务！
