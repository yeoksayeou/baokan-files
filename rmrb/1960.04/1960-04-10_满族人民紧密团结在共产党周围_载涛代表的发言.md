I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 national budget. I wholeheartedly endorse them and have learned further from them. Our country has already experienced the great socialist revolution and has now entered a new period of great socialist construction. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the people of the whole country are in high spirits and full of vigor. After the extraordinary leaps forward of 1958 and 1959, we have achieved tremendous construction results. Thanks to the establishment of the people's communes, the poor and backward face of the countryside is rapidly changing. We are building socialism at high speed and leaping forward towards the highest ideal of mankind, communism. This is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of the People's Communes!

Currently, the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. Our 650 million Chinese people have stood up strongly and are living a happy and prosperous life. We will certainly surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products within the next ten years. We feel无比自豪 (wúbǐ zìháo – incredibly proud). This should be entirely attributed to the wise leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao. This is also inseparable from the close unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Now I would like to talk about the Manchu people scattered in various provinces and cities. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line and under the leadership of the Party's ethnic policy, everyone has the opportunity to gloriously participate in the productive labor of socialist construction in different positions, thanks to the establishment of the people's communes. Especially the Manchu women living in cities, who were subjected to feudal constraints for a long time in the old society, can now participate in productive labor and be completely liberated from household chores thanks to the establishment of canteens and nurseries. Manchu children and youths no longer have any dropouts from school.

The Party has also given the Manchu people many opportunities to visit and learn, which has improved their political awareness. Under the care, education, and cultivation of the Party, many advanced workers have also emerged among the Manchu people. Under the leadership and education of the Party, the Manchu people and all fraternal ethnic groups are more closely united around the Party, striving together for the construction of socialism.

We Manchu people are growing up in this great Mao Zedong era, and we feel infinite happiness and pride. The lives of our Manchu people are improving day by day, changing the idle and impoverished look of the past. We wholeheartedly sing the praises of the great Party and the great Chairman Mao!

Although I am over seventy years old, I feel myself becoming younger day by day, because the new era makes every elderly person feel that they are still in their prime, gaining more vitality. I believe that I will be able to work more for socialism for decades to come.

Here, I represent the Manchu people to express our determination. Our determination is: in the future, we must resolutely listen to the Party, follow the Party, and go wherever the Party directs us, and contribute all our strength to socialist society!

    满族人民紧密团结在共产党周围
    载涛代表的发言
    我听了李富春副总理的国民经济计划的报告和李先念副总理的1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。使我衷心拥护并得到了进一步的学习，我们国家已经经历了伟大的社会主义革命，现在已进入了伟大的社会主义建设的新时期，全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下意气轩昂，干劲冲天，经过1958年1959年特大跃进，获得了巨大的建设成绩，由于人民公社的成立，迅速的改变着农村贫穷和落后的面貌，正在高速度地建设社会主义并向着人类最高理想共产主义飞跃前进。这是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，人民公社的胜利！
    目前国际上是东风继续压倒西风，我们六亿五千万中国人民坚强地站起来，过着美好的幸福生活，在今后十年内主要工业品产量方面一定可以超过英国，我们感到无比的自豪，这完全应当归功于伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导。这和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的紧密团结更是分不开的。
    我现在谈谈散居在各省市的满民，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的民族政策领导下，由于人民公社的成立，人人都有机会在不同的岗位上光荣地参加了社会主义建设的生产劳动。特别是在都市中居住的满族妇女，在旧社会中更是很久的受着封建束缚，现在由于食堂和托儿所的成立，她们可以好好地参加生产劳动，彻底地从家庭琐务中解放出来。满族的少年和青年，也不再有失学的人了。
    党还给予满民许多参观学习的机会，使得在政治觉悟上都得到提高。在党的关怀教育和培养下，满民中也涌现了不少的先进工作者。在党的领导和教育下，满民和各兄弟民族更加紧密团结在党的周围，共同为建设社会主义而奋斗。
    我们满民生长在这伟大的毛泽东时期，感到无限的幸福和骄傲，我们满民的生活都在日益提高，改变了过去那种好闲贫困的面貌，我们衷心歌颂伟大的党，伟大的毛主席！
    我虽是七十多岁的人，但我感觉自己日益年青起来，因为新的时代使每个老年人都感到自己还处在壮年时代，得到更多的生命力，相信自己一定能够更多地为社会主义工作几十年。
    我这里代表满民表示我们的决心，我们的决心是：今后一定要坚决听党的话，跟着党走，党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里，为社会主义社会贡献出一切力量！
