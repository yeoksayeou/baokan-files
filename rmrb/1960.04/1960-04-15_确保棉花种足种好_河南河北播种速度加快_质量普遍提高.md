Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou – Cotton sowing in Henan Province, one of China's major cotton-producing areas, has entered a high tide. From south to north, from the western Henan mountains to the eastern Henan plains, the province has entered a busy and intense sowing period. Under the slogan of "Race against time, seize every second, and resolutely overcome the suitable sowing period," the masses are ensuring that all cotton is planted sufficiently, well, and at the right time. As of the 5th, cotton had been planted in 30% of the province's total cotton field area. Xinxiang Prefecture, with its fast progress, has sown 69.5% of its area. In Qingfeng, Linxian, Huixian, Mengxian, and fourteen other counties and cities, cotton sowing has been completed with both fast progress and good quality.

In order to break through the first hurdle to a bumper cotton harvest – the sowing hurdle – cadres and the masses in all cotton-producing areas of the province are focusing intensely and meticulously on ensuring sufficient, high-quality, and timely sowing. From the province to the special districts, counties, communes, and down to the production brigades, field meetings, on-site meetings, cotton-growing expert symposiums, and technical research meetings were widely held before sowing to inspect cotton sowing preparations and formulate sowing standards, quality, and technical measures. This year, all areas of the province, whether concentrated or dispersed cotton-producing areas, high-yield or low-yield areas, are paying great attention to quality during sowing. The Party committee secretaries of the thirty-one communes in Fugou County, sixty-four committee members, and four hundred and forty-five branch secretaries went deep into the fields to personally operate seed drills. Each commune extracted 51,000 professional laborers, including Party and League members and cotton-growing experts, to implement large-scale collaboration and operations, sowing 37,400 mu of cotton per day. In Neixiang County, a scattered cotton-producing area, to achieve full seedling emergence from a single sowing, the county organized 660 labor models, cotton-growing experts, and technicians into 49 sowing technical guidance groups to provide itinerant guidance, identifying and resolving problems on the spot.

This newspaper reports: Farmers in the cotton-growing areas of Hebei Province have fully launched a cotton sowing campaign. As of April 8th, according to incomplete statistics, the province had sown 5.8 million mu of cotton. Starting last winter, Hebei Province began preparations for sowing such as land demarcation, land preparation, fertilizer application, and irrigation. After a winter and spring of efforts, 86% of the province's cotton fields have been irrigated, with the area of irrigated land increasing by more than 5 million mu compared to last year. All cotton fields were deep-plowed in winter, with 80% plowed to a depth of eight inches or more, and over 14 million mu were fertilized with base fertilizer, generally applying 8,000 to 10,000 jin per mu. On the basis of vigorously developing water, fertilizer, and soil construction, cotton fields planted using the method of dividing land into squares reached more than 12.17 million mu, accounting for 81% of the total cotton field area. Among them, there were more than 10,300 high-yield squares, covering an area of more than 9.27 million mu, basically realizing a major revolution in the cultivation system centered on the garden-like management of high-yield squares.

This year, the cotton sowing period in Hebei is about ten days earlier than in previous years, and all sowing is drought-resistant sowing. In order to ensure sowing quality, all localities have put forward the slogan of "One sowing, full seedling emergence" and carried out a "five checks and five observations" inspection, checking the irrigation, observing the soil moisture; checking the harrowing, observing the fineness; checking the agricultural tools, observing the improvement; checking the technology, observing the matching; checking the pesticides, observing the seed treatment. In order to effectively grasp the sowing progress and quality, many areas have established a level-by-level acceptance system: the small teams are accepted by the production teams, the production teams are accepted by the management areas and communes, and the communes are accepted by the county.

    确保棉花种足种好
    河南河北播种速度加快　质量普遍提高
    新华社郑州讯　我国主要棉花产区之一的河南省棉花播种工作已经进入高潮。全省从南到北，从豫西山区到豫东平原，都已进入繁忙、紧张的播种期，广大群众在“争分秒，抢时间，坚决渡过适宜播种关”的口号下，保证全部棉花种足、种好、种适时。到5日止，全省已种棉田，占棉田总面积30％。进度快的新乡地区，已播种69.5％，清丰、林县、辉县、孟县等十四个县市的棉花已播种结束，播种进度快，质量好。
    为了突破棉花丰收第一关——播种关，全省各产棉区的广大干部和群众狠抓、细抓、种足、种好、种适时。从省到专区、县、社，直到生产大队，在播种以前，普遍召开现场会、战地会、植棉能手座谈会和技术研究会，检查棉花播种准备工作和制定播种规格、质量和技术措施。今年，全省不论集中产区与分散产区，高产区与低产区，在播种时对质量都十分重视。扶沟县三十一个公社党委书记、六十四名委员和四百四十五个支部书记，都深入到田，亲自摇耧播种，各公社抽出了包括党团员、植棉能手在内的五万一千名专业劳力，实行大协作，大兵团作战，一天播种棉花三万七千四百亩。分散产棉区的内乡县为了达到一次播种一次全苗，全县组织劳动模范、植棉能手和技术员等六百六十人，组成四十九个播种技术辅导组，巡回指导，发现问题，就地解决。
    本报讯　河北省棉区农民全面展开了棉花播种运动。截止4月8日不完全统计全省已播种棉花五百八十万亩。从去年冬天开始，河北全省就开始了棉田的划方、整地、送粪、浇灌等播种准备活动。经过一冬一春的努力，全省86％的棉田实现了水利化，水浇田的面积比去年扩大五百多万亩。全部棉田都进行了冬耕，其中80％深耕达八寸以上，一千四百多万亩施了底肥，一般每亩施八千到一万斤。在大搞水、肥、土建设的基础上，全省划方种植的棉田达一千二百十七万多亩，占棉田总面积的81％。其中丰产方一万零三百多个，面积九百二十七万多亩，基本上实现了以丰产方园田化为中心的耕作制度大革命。
    今年河北棉花播种期比往年提前十天左右，而且全部是抗旱播种。为了保证播种质量，各地提出了“一次播种，一次全苗”的口号，开展了查浇地、看墒情；查打耙，看精细；查农具，看改良；查技术，看配套；查农药，看拌种的“五查五看”大检查。为了切实掌握播种进度和质量，许多地区建立了小队由生产队验收，生产队由管理区和公社验收，公社由县验收的逐级验收制。（附图片）
