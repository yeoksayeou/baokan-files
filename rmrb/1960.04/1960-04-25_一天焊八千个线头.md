If you don't know how much soldering work there is in the postal and telecommunications sector, it's hard to understand how important it is to create a labor-saving and high-speed soldering iron. If you go to a 1000-line automatic telephone exchange, in front of the main distribution frame, on the terminal boards, on the wire arcs, the dense soldering points are one next to the other, at least more than forty thousand.

In 1956, a mechanic could solder more than five hundred wire ends a day, which was already a very high record. In April 1959, Comrade Pan Xingrun of the Xi'an Telecommunications Engineering Company improved the operation method and soldered three thousand eight hundred wire ends a day. At that time, some people thought it would be difficult to improve further. After the Party called for a great technical innovation and technical revolution, Pan Xingrun thought: "The main tool for soldering is the soldering iron, and we must focus on the soldering iron." He boldly changed the handle of the soldering iron to a curved shape. Using the curved-handle soldering iron, he created a record of soldering four thousand one hundred wire ends a day during the National Congress of Heroes.

This greatly inspired his colleagues. Comrades from the Beijing Telephone Bureau Engineering Company further improved the soldering iron. After the National Congress of Heroes, Comrade Ling Houji of the Beijing Telephone Bureau used their improved soldering iron to create a new record of soldering five thousand seven hundred and thirty wire ends a day.

Some people thought: It's really difficult to improve any further! However, the technical revolution has no end. Before the opening of this year's Beijing Congress of Heroes, all the comrades of the Beijing Telephone Bureau Engineering Company worked hard for three days and nights, and finally transformed the soldering iron into a pistol-style automatic tin-feeding one. With this soldering iron, a mechanic can solder eight thousand wire ends a day.

The soldering iron is a small thing, but it shines so strongly with the brilliance of continuous revolutionary thought.

    一天焊八千个线头
    要是不知道邮电部门内有多少焊接工作，就难于理解创造一把省力高速的电烙铁是多么的重要了。你到一个容量为1000门自动电话局里去看看，在总配线架前，在端子板上，线弧上，密密麻麻的焊点一个挨一个，至少也在四万以上。
    1956年时一个机务员一天能焊接五百多个线头，已经是很高的纪录了。1959年4月西安电信工程公司的潘兴润同志改进了操作方法，一天焊了三千八百个线头。当时有人认为再提高就有些困难了。党号召大闹技术革新和技术革命以后，潘兴润想：“焊接的主要工具是烙铁，要从电烙铁身上打主意才行”。他大胆地将烙铁把改成弯的。使用弯把烙铁，在全国群英会期间他创造了一天焊四千一百个线头的纪录。
    这使同行们受到很大启发。北京市话局工程公司的同志们又进一步改进了电烙铁。全国群英会后北京市话局的凌厚基同志用他们改进的电烙铁创造了日焊五千七百三十个线头的新纪录。
    有些人想：再往上提高可真难啦！可是，技术革命没有止境。今年北京市的群英会开幕以前，北京市话局工程公司的全体同志苦战了三个昼夜，终于将电烙铁改成为手枪式自动给锡的。用这种烙铁，一个机务员一天可以焊八千个线头。
    电烙铁是一件小东西，但是它却这样强烈地闪射出不断革命的思想的光辉。
