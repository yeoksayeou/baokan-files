Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - According to a report in today's "Akahata", the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, at its 10th Plenary Session held yesterday, passed a statement calling on all democratic forces in Japan to make the utmost efforts to support the struggle of the Miike Coal Miners of the Mitsui Mining Company until they achieve final victory.

The statement believes that the fascist-style attacks by the Nobusuke Kishi government and monopoly capital, which sold out the interests of the Japanese nation and signed the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty", on the core force of the Japanese democratic movement, namely the workers' movement. The statement said that the Japanese people have enough strength to repel the attacks of the reactionaries and safeguard democracy. The statement pointed out that the Japanese people had won victory two years ago in the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the notorious "Police Duties Execution Law".

The statement called on all workers and democratic forces to immediately rise up and use action to crush the conspiracy of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the monopoly capitalist group to openly restore militarism.

The statement also demanded that all workers closely unite with the Miike coal miners, hold workplace rallies and strikes to protest the crime of right-wing groups, instigated by the Mitsui Mining Company, attacking striking workers and murdering miner Kubo Kiyoshi.

The statement demanded that all democratic groups and local joint struggle organizations opposing the new "Security Treaty" actively participate in this protest action to support the coal miners' struggle.

The statement hoped that all members of the Japan Socialist Party would cooperate with the Communist Party to participate in this struggle to support the Miike coal miners.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) issued a statement today protesting the Japanese police authorities' arrest of Miike coal miners today to suppress the strike struggle.

The Omuta City Police authorities unreasonably searched the Miike Coal Miners' Union this morning, issued "arrest warrants" to twenty-five members of the Miike Coal Miners' Union, and arrested two workers.

The statement pointed out that this behavior of the Nobusuke Kishi government is an indivisible part of its policy of suppressing the labor movement and is an attack on the democratic forces in Japan. This is inseparable from the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempt to force the Diet to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty".

The statement said that Sohyo-affiliated union members will hold workplace rallies tomorrow to demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the police authorities not interfere in the strike and immediately release the arrested workers.

The statement said that if the police authorities continue to arrest workers, Sohyo will take more forceful protest actions.

    日共号召民主力量全力支持三池煤矿工人的斗争
    “总评”发表声明要求当局立即停止迫害罢工工人
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会在昨天举行的第十次全体会议上通过一项声明，号召日本所有民主力量尽最大的努力支持三井矿山公司三池煤矿工人的斗争，直到他们获得最后胜利。
    声明认为，出卖日本民族利益、签订新日美“安全条约”的岸信介政府和垄断资本对三池煤矿工人的法西斯式袭击，是对日本民主运动核心力量即工人阶级运动的进攻。声明说，日本人民有足够的力量来击退反动派的进攻和维护民主。声明指出，两年前日本人民在反对岸信介政府修改臭名远扬的“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中曾经获得胜利。
    声明呼吁所有的工人和民主力量立即奋起，用行动来粉碎岸信介政府和垄断资本集团公然恢复军国主义的阴谋。
    声明还要求所有的工人同三池煤矿工人密切团结，举行工作场所大会和罢工，抗议在三井矿山公司唆使下右翼团体袭击罢工工人和杀害矿工久保清的罪行。
    声明要求一切民主团体和反对新“安全条约”的各地方共同斗争组织积极参加这个抗议行动，支持煤矿工人的斗争。
    声明希望日本社会党全体党员同共产党合作参加这一支援三池煤矿工人的斗争。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天发表声明，抗议日本警察当局今天逮捕三池煤矿工人，镇压罢工斗争。
    大牟田市警察当局今天清早无理搜查三池煤矿工会，向三池煤矿工会的二十五名会员发出了“逮捕令”，并且逮捕了两名工人。
    声明指出，岸信介政府的这种行为是它镇压劳工运动政策的不可分割的一部分，是对日本民主力量的进攻。这是同岸信介政府要强迫国会通过新日美“安全条约”的企图分不开的。
    声明说，“总评”所属工会会员将在明天举行工作场所大会，要求岸信介政府和警察当局不得干涉罢工和立即释放被捕的工人。
    声明说，如果警察当局还要逮捕工人，“总评”将采取更有力的抗议行动。
