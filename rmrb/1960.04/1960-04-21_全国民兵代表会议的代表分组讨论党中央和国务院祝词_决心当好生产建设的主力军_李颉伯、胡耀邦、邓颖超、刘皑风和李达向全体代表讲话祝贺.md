Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The National Militia Representative Conference held a plenary meeting this afternoon. Li Jiebo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Liu Aifeng, Vice-Minister of Education, and Li Da, Vice-Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, spoke at the meeting one after another, extending warm congratulations to the conference and the national militia.

Li Jiebo said: Chairman Mao's great call to establish militia divisions on a large scale has quickly received enthusiastic responses from workers and people across the country. In the past year or so, after joining the militia organizations, the broad masses of workers in factories and mines have further improved their patriotic ideology and enhanced their enthusiasm for building the motherland through the Party's education and participation in various training activities. They universally demand to be communist fighters who are both literate and martial, with a high degree of organization and discipline. They have fully demonstrated the heroic spirit and tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army on the production front, powerfully overcoming various difficulties, conquering various weak links, greatly improving labor productivity, and promoting the great leap forward in production. He called on trade union organizations at all levels to make every effort under the unified leadership of the Party to greatly strengthen the militia organizations of factories and mines, and to further bring out the superiority of the whole people being soldiers and establishing militia divisions on a large scale.

Deng Yingchao said that all the female representatives attending this conference are models of Chinese women in the era of the Great Leap Forward. Our female militia representatives fully demonstrate the glorious tradition of Chinese women being brave in combat and loving labor in the struggle against aggression and for building a peaceful life. She requested that female militia members on all fronts, including industry, agriculture, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, science and culture, under the leadership of the Party, summon greater vigor, further actively participate in and support the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and strive to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, so as to greatly improve labor productivity, increase production, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan.

Hu Yaobang said that establishing militia divisions on a large scale has fully played the shock role of youth in production. At the same time, it is of great significance for improving the patriotic ideology of our youth, strengthening national defense concepts, learning various military skills, developing a high degree of organization and discipline, cultivating the brave and tenacious spirit and fighting style of our youth, and continuously strengthening the physique of youth. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that the youth of our country will actively participate in the militia organizations and become activists and backbones in the militia organizations. We must hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the policy of the whole people being soldiers and combining labor and military affairs, and strive to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland and to defend our great motherland and world peace.

Liu Aifeng said in his speech that establishing militia divisions on a large scale is a good way to educate and train young people, and it also has a significant promoting effect on accelerating socialist construction. Militia training and the school's basic task of cultivating all-round developed communist new people are completely consistent. Education administrative departments and schools at all levels must closely rely on the leadership of the Party and, with the assistance of the local military departments, closely cooperate with the Communist Youth League, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Women's Federation and other relevant parties to strengthen cooperation and jointly do a good job in militia work.

Li Da expressed his hope in his speech that after returning, all representatives would help various places to carry out national defense sports work in order to coordinate with the militia organizations in implementing the policy of the whole people being soldiers.

Yesterday and this morning, the conference was divided into forty-seven groups for discussion. All the representatives warmly supported the congratulatory message delivered by Marshal He Long on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the reports of Marshal Luo Ronghuan and General Luo Ruiqing. In the discussions, the representatives enthusiastically expressed that the encouragement and teachings of the Party and state leaders gave them great encouragement. Their speeches also introduced the brilliant achievements and rich experiences of the national militia in defending and building the motherland. They also expressed that in the future, they must, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, summon revolutionary vigor, and work with the people of the country to further give full play to the role of the main force and shock brigade in the great socialist construction cause of our country. At the same time, we must actively strengthen national defense construction and be prepared at all times to defend against imperialist aggression. (Attached picture)
