Railway Department Trials Seamless Track
Welding short rails into long rails has four major benefits: 1. Saves steel and maintenance costs; 2. Extends the service life of equipment; 3. Increases train speed; 4. Makes train travel smoother.

(Xinhua News Agency) The use of advanced technologies such as aluminothermic welding and arc welding to weld long rails and lay seamless tracks has been trialed in many railway departments across the country.

Welding ordinary rails into long rails of about 500 meters or 1,000 meters is a new technology and is one of the fundamental measures to overcome current railway problems. In order to promote this mass movement of transforming railway equipment throughout the country, the Ministry of Railways recently held a national railway engineering welding and repair work technical performance competition site meeting in Jinan.

The current rails are only ten to twelve meters long each, with many joints. Due to the impact of high-speed train operation, rail joints are extremely prone to wear, causing a series of problems in the rails themselves, accessories, sleepers, roadbeds, and track conditions.

Seamless track has many advantages: First, because short rails are welded into long rails, joints are basically eliminated, saving about six to seven tons of steel per kilometer of track, and maintenance costs are also greatly reduced. The seamless track laid by the Beijing Railway Bureau in 1957 used only 69 maintenance man-hours per kilometer last year, while ordinary tracks require more than 280. Secondly, it extends the service life of equipment, postpones the cycle of major repairs and rail replacement, which saves capital and reduces interference with transportation due to construction. Third, it can reduce the running resistance of trains by 10%—20%, which is of great importance for accelerating train speed and increasing transport capacity. At the same time, the train runs more smoothly.

While welding long rails, the engineering workers of the Jinan, Beijing and other railway bureaus also carried out the work of welding and repairing old rails. In the past, railway departments sent short rails under seven meters to steel plants for remelting. Now these short rails can be welded into long rails of about 25 meters for use in secondary lines.

    铁路部门试铺无缝线路
    短钢轨焊接成长钢轨有四大好处：一、节省钢材和维修费用；二、延长设备的使用期限；三、提高行车速度；四、列车行驶更加平稳
    据新华社讯　采用铝热焊、电弧焊等先进技术焊接长钢轨，铺设无缝线路，已在全国许多铁路部门试行。
    把普通钢轨焊接成为五百米或一千米左右的长轨，是一项新技术，它是克服目前铁路病害的根本性措施之一。为在全国范围内普遍开展这种改造铁路设备的群众运动，铁道部最近在济南召开了全国铁路工务焊修工作技术表演赛现场会。
    目前的钢轨每根只有十到十二米长，接头很多，由于列车飞速运行的影响，极易造成钢轨接头磨损，使钢轨本身、配件、枕木、道床及线路状态产生一系列的病害。
    无缝线路具有很多优越性：首先，由于将短钢轨焊接成长钢轨，基本上消灭了接头，每公里线路约可节约六至七吨钢材，维修费用也大大减少。北京铁路局1957年铺设的无缝线路，在去年一年内一公里仅用了六十九个维修工时，而普通线路约需二百八十多个。其次是延长了设备的使用期限，推迟了大修、换轨的周期，可以节约资金和减少因施工对运输的干扰。第三，能减轻列车10％—20％的运行阻力，对加速行车速度和提高运量有很大作用。同时，行车更加平稳。
    在焊接长钢轨的同时，济南、北京等铁路局的工务职工还开展了焊修旧轨工作。过去铁路部门对七米以下的短轨都送到钢铁厂回炉。现在可以把这些短轨焊接成为二十五米左右的长轨，用于次要线路。（附图片）
