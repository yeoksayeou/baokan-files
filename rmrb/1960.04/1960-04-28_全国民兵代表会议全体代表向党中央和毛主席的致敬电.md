To the esteemed Party Central Committee, to the esteemed Chairman Mao:
    We, the comrades attending the National Militia Representative Conference, entrusted by the people's militia across the nation and with immense excitement, extend our most heartfelt greetings and our most sublime and sincere respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!
    Our country's militia has grown and developed under the wise leadership and nurturing of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. During the past revolutionary wars, our vast militia, together with the people of the whole country, fully supported and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army, overcame all kinds of difficulties, defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad, overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and achieved the great victory of the revolutionary wars. Since the national liberation, our vast militia has always been united around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, while vigilantly defending the country's land and sea borders in coordination with the People's Liberation Army. In 1958, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy of vigorously developing militia divisions and making all people soldiers, which reflected the common aspirations and strong will of our people to defend the motherland. The people of the whole country warmly responded to the Party's great call, and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, in the movement for the people's communes and in the struggle against military provocations by U.S. imperialism, a movement to vigorously develop militia divisions was launched, and the militia organization achieved great development. We deeply realize that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the guiding light for militia building and the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory. Having the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness for our 650 million people. We will forever follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and march from victory to victory.
    Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! We will certainly abide by the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and give play to the role of the militia as "a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization." We will certainly strive to raise our socialist and communist consciousness, learn science, culture and military knowledge, strengthen physical training, and strive to become well-rounded talents who are both red and expert, capable of both writing and fighting. We must further learn from the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and in various activities, implement organization militarization, action combatization, life collectivization, and management democratization, enhance organizational discipline and revolutionary fighting will, and act as shock brigades on all fronts of socialist construction. At the same time, we are also always prepared that if imperialism dares to invade our country, we will resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively join the People's Liberation Army, and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in combat, and we will fight wherever the Party directs us, and completely eliminate the invaders.
    Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! We, all the militia representatives, are extremely happy and honored to have such a valuable opportunity to gather in the capital of our great motherland, to attend this National Militia Representative Conference, to report our work to the Party and the government on behalf of the national militia, to receive the teachings of the Party and the government, and to receive the kind concern and encouragement of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We know that the work we have done is still very limited, and that the reason we have been able to achieve a little success is entirely due to the result of the wise leadership of the Party and you. Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! We guarantee to the Party that we will never fail to live up to the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and we will never fail to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country. We will certainly guard against arrogance and rashness, learn with an open mind, and together with the national militia, hold high the red banner of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the glorious traditions of the militia, muster revolutionary enthusiasm, strive to promote the sustained great leap forward of the national economy, strengthen militia building, and bravely advance for the construction and defense of the great socialist cause!
    We respectfully wish the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party to shine as brightly as the sun and the moon!
    We respectfully wish the great leader of the people of all nationalities of China, Chairman Mao, a long life!
                              All Representatives of the National Militia Representative Conference
                                            April 27, 1960

    全国民兵代表会议全体代表向党中央和毛主席的致敬电敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席：
    我们出席全国民兵代表会议的全体同志，受着全国民兵的殷切嘱托，怀着无比兴奋的心情，谨向党中央和毛主席致以最衷心的问候和最崇高最诚挚的敬意！
    我国的民兵，是在党中央和毛主席的英明领导和培养下生长和发展起来的。在历次革命战争中，我们广大民兵与全国人民一道，全力支援和配合人民解放军，战胜了各种困难，打败了国内外各种强大的敌人，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，取得了革命战争的伟大胜利。在全国解放以后，我们广大民兵，一直是团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，一面积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设，一面配合人民解放军警惕地保卫着祖国的陆海边防。1958年，党中央和毛主席提出了大办民兵师、全民皆兵的方针，反映了我国人民保卫祖国的共同愿望和坚强意志。全国人民热烈响应党的伟大号召，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在人民公社化运动和反对美帝国主义军事挑衅的斗争中，掀起了大办民兵师的运动，民兵组织得到了巨大发展。我们深深体会到：毛主席的人民战争思想，是民兵建设的指路明灯，是获得胜利的根本保证。有党和毛主席的英明领导，是我们六亿五千万人民最大的幸福。我们永远跟着共产党和毛主席，从胜利走向胜利。
    敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席！我们一定遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，发挥民兵“是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织”的作用。我们一定努力提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，学习科学文化和军事知识，加强体质锻炼，力争成为又红又专、能文能武的全面人材。我们要进一步学习人民解放军的光荣传统，在各种活动中，贯彻实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化，增强组织性纪律性和革命斗争意志，在社会主义建设的各个战线上当突击队。同时，我们也时刻准备着，如果帝国主义敢于侵略我国，我们就坚决响应党中央和毛主席的号召，积极参加人民解放军，并配合人民解放军作战，党指向那里，我们就打到那里，彻底消灭侵略者。
    敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席！我们全体民兵代表，能有这样一个宝贵的机会，欢聚在伟大祖国的首都，出席这次全国民兵代表会议，代表全国民兵向党和政府汇报工作，接受党和政府的教导，得到党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀和鼓励，我们感到万分的高兴和光荣。我们知道：我们所做的工作还很有限，我们所以能够做出一点成绩，完全是由于党和您的英明领导的结果。敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席！我们向党保证：我们绝不辜负党和毛主席对我们的教导，绝不辜负全国人民对我们的期望，我们一定戒骄戒躁，虚心学习，和全国民兵一起，高高举起党的总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，发扬民兵的光荣传统，鼓足革命干劲，努力促进国民经济的持续大跃进，加强民兵建设，为建设和保卫伟大的社会主义事业而奋勇前进！
    敬祝伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党与日月同辉！
    敬祝中国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
                              全国民兵代表会议全体代表
                                            1960年4月27日
