“Philosophy Research” published an article by Comrade Sa Renxing in its third issue of 1960: “The Essence of the Debate on the ‘Identity of Thinking and Being’”. The author states: The debate on the issue of "the identity of thinking and being" is, in essence, a struggle between thorough materialistic monism and dualistic tendencies, between materialist dialectics and metaphysics, and between the Marxist theory of knowledge and the old, i.e., metaphysical materialist theory of knowledge. Shi Cheng's viewpoint, one of the debaters, clearly demonstrates dualistic tendencies and metaphysics, and clearly demonstrates that he stands on the position of the old materialism's reflection theory.

Shi Cheng's central idea is: to deny the unity of opposites between thinking and being.

Sa Renxing states: Comrade Shi Cheng asserts that "the identity of thinking and being" is equivalent to equating thinking and being, thus believing that "the identity of thinking and being" can only be a principle of idealism, and that anyone who advocates the identity of thinking and being is blurring the line between materialism and idealism, and is propagating idealism. To prove his assertion, Comrade Shi Cheng insists that Engels, in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," regarded "the identity of thinking and being" as a principle of idealism, and also quoted several passages from classic works opposing the identity of thinking and being. This creates the illusion that Marx, Engels, and Lenin all opposed and rejected any identity between thinking and being. In reality, the classic writers only opposed equating thinking and being, opposed the idealistic identity that being is identical to thinking, and insisted on the materialist dialectical identity of thinking and being.

The article continues: The essence of the problem does not lie in the interpretation of the word "identity," but in whether "the identity of contradictions" applies to the relationship between thinking and being. Comrade Shi Cheng's answer to this question is a complete negation. Comrade Shi Cheng believes that "the identity of thinking and being" and "the identity of contradictions" are two unrelated categories; the former is a category of idealism, and the latter is a category of materialist dialectics; if "the ‘identity of thinking and being’ is said to be dialectics about ‘the identity of contradictions’," it is to confuse two different categories, which is absurd. The author points out: Of course, "the identity of thinking and being" and "the identity of contradictions" are not identical or equivalent categories. However, the two are not unrelated. In the history of philosophy, there is materialist dialectics, and there is also idealist dialectics. Hegel applied "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between being and thinking, and interpreted the identity of being and thinking as a dialectical identity identical to the spirit, which is the viewpoint of idealist dialectics. Conversely, the dialectical materialist philosophy of Marxism applies the category of "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between thinking and being, believing that the relationship between thinking and being is both material (unified in matter) and a contradictory identity, which is the viewpoint of materialist dialectics. Linking the two pairs of categories in this way is by no means a "confusion," but rather applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, adhering to dialectics' (i.e., thorough) materialism, and adhering to materialism's (i.e., thorough) dialectics. Therefore, the problem is not that others are confusing something, but that Comrade Shi Cheng himself mechanically separates materialism and dialectics, which are inseparable in the Marxist philosophical system, and falls into the quagmire of metaphysics.

Sa Renxing states: Comrade Shi Cheng opposes applying the category of "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between thinking and being. According to Comrade Shi Cheng, the most universal law of the unity of opposites does not apply to the highest and largest categories – between thinking and being; thinking and being are not a unity of contradictions; thinking as secondary and being as primary cannot interact and transform each other under certain conditions, otherwise it must be "the principle of identity." Comrade Shi Cheng believes that "the principle of identity" advocates an inseparable connection between consciousness and matter, and between matter and consciousness; materialism should advocate that consciousness and matter, and matter and consciousness are unrelated, independent of each other, and there is no connection whatsoever. Comrade Shi Cheng's viewpoint not only involves the fundamental principles of dialectical materialism but also involves the fundamental difference between materialistic monism and dualism.

Is it materialistic monism or dualism?

Sa Renxing states: Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being demonstrates a dualistic tendency, and according to his logic, he will inevitably go to Kant, to dualism and agnosticism. Sa Renxing analyzed the following three aspects to refute Comrade Shi Cheng's dualistic viewpoint.

Regarding the question of whether thinking and consciousness are transformed from being and matter, materialism believes that consciousness is a product of the material world developing to a higher stage. The root of consciousness lies in the material world, which involves the transformation of being into thinking, and matter into consciousness. Materialistic monism lies in the belief that being and matter are primary, and thinking and consciousness are secondary, and the sole source of the world is matter. Idealistic monism lies in the belief that thinking and consciousness are primary, and being and matter are secondary, and the sole source of the world is consciousness. Dualism, on the other hand, believes that the world has two sources – matter and consciousness. Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being, thereby denying that consciousness is transformed from matter, inevitably leads to the conclusion that consciousness is one of the independent sources. This is the viewpoint of dualism.

Regarding the question of whether thinking and consciousness are independent of or dependent on being and matter, materialism believes that consciousness is the reflection of objective existence by the human brain (highly organized matter). Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being, thereby denying the dependence and reliance of thinking on being, and consciousness on matter, inevitably leads to the conclusion that thinking and consciousness exist independently. This is the viewpoint of dualism.

Regarding the question of whether thinking and being are governed by the same laws, dialectical materialism believes that thinking and being are governed by the same laws, i.e., the laws of dialectics, and the dialectics of thinking is the reflection of objective dialectics. Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being, thereby denying that thinking depends on and relies on being, inevitably leads to the conclusion that thinking and being are not governed by the same laws, and the laws of thinking are not a reflection of the laws of the objective world. This is the viewpoint of dualism.

As mentioned above: Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being cuts off the "bridge from this to that," which inevitably leads to the conclusion that thinking cannot know being. This is also the viewpoint of agnosticism. Is it a passive reflection theory or a "dynamic revolutionary reflection theory"?

The third part of the article criticizes Comrade Shi Cheng for standing on Feuerbach's position on the theory of reflection. The author writes: Marxist reflection theory, on the basis of acknowledging that "reflection cannot exist without the reflected," further acknowledges that under certain conditions, the reflector also has a counter-effect on the reflected, that is, under certain conditions, the transformation of the objective world also depends on thinking, and the transformation of thinking into being. Lenin wrote in "Philosophical Notebooks": "Human consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates the objective world." Comrade Mao Zedong explicitly pointed out: Marxist reflection theory is a "dynamic revolutionary reflection theory." This is the most profound and scientific summary of Marxist reflection theory. Sa Renxing used the facts of the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in the Chinese revolution and Chinese socialist construction to illustrate the creative role of thinking, as a correct reflection of being, on being, which is precisely the transformation of consciousness into being.

The article continues: However, the reflection theory of old materialism, after acknowledging the major premise that thinking depends on being and that thinking is a reflection of being, does not acknowledge that under certain conditions, the transformation of being also depends on thinking, and action also depends on theory, and that thinking and consciousness can be transformed into objective things. They regard thinking as a passive reflection of being, which does not play a dynamic revolutionary role in transforming being. Therefore, Marxists call the reflection theory of old materialism a passive reflection theory. Comrade Shi Cheng essentially denies that after acknowledging that thinking is a reflection of being, it is also necessary to acknowledge that under certain conditions, the transformation of being also depends on thinking, and thinking can also be transformed into being. In this way, he stands on the position of the passive reflection theory of old materialism and deviates from the position of the "dynamic revolutionary reflection theory" of Marxism.

Sa Renxing states: Comrade Mao Zedong, unlike some philosophers, did not merely repeat the basic proposition of the materialist theory of knowledge that "thinking is a reflection of being," but inherited Marx and Lenin and further applied dialectics to the theory of reflection, further developing the dialectics of thinking and being, and theory and practice, thereby greatly advancing the Marxist theory of knowledge. In "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, acknowledged that in the overall development of history, material things determine spiritual things, and on the other hand, fully acknowledged the counter-effect of the spirit, which under certain conditions can play a decisive and major role in the transformation of being. This is an important development of Comrade Mao Zedong's materialist dialectics of thinking and being, subjectiveness and objectivity, and theory and practice. Comrade Mao Zedong has always led the Chinese people to fully utilize objective laws and highly develop subjective initiative, which is inseparable from this philosophical viewpoint.

Whether to admit or not that under certain conditions, practice also depends on the theory derived from practice, and the development (transformation) of being also depends on thinking, which is a reflection of being, and that theory and thinking can be transformed into objective existence under certain conditions, is not an abstract theoretical issue, but an issue that has a major impact on practice. According to Comrade Shi Cheng's viewpoint, it is impossible to understand putting politics in command, using the abstract to lead the concrete, the counter-effect of the superstructure on the economic base, and the subjective initiative of people.

Is the reflection of thinking on being a one-time completion or a process? Does thinking conform to being with contradictory conformity or absolute conformity?

Sa Renxing points out: Both old materialism and dialectical materialism acknowledge that the world is knowable, and both acknowledge that the world is knowable from the standpoint of reflection theory. However, old materialism cannot dialectically understand the knowability of the world and cannot apply dialectics to reflection theory and to the process of cognition. Therefore, it metaphysically believes that the reflection of thinking on being is completed once, and the conformity of thinking to being is absolute, without contradiction, rigid, and without development; while dialectical materialism believes that cognition is an infinite, dialectical movement process, and the conformity of thinking to being contains contradictions, that is, their unity is a unity of opposites, and so on. This is another fundamental dividing line between Marxist reflection theory and old materialism reflection theory. Comrade Shi Cheng acknowledges reflection theory and the theory that the world is knowable, but he opposes the unity of opposites between thinking and being. Then, the "conformity" and "consistency" between thinking and being that he speaks of are certainly not "conformity" and "consistency" that contain opposites and contradictions, but absolute "conformity" and "consistency"; that is to say, the reflection of thinking on being is not an infinite process that never ends, but is completed once. Isn't this the reflection theory of old materialism? A fundamental weakness of old materialists is that they cannot apply dialectics to reflection theory. Comrade Shi Cheng opposes applying the category of "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between thinking and being and denies that thinking and being are both opposed and unified, so he can only stand on the position of old materialism's reflection theory unless he draws agnostic conclusions.

Quoting Comrade Mao Zedong's argument on the contradictory and unified process of thinking and being, Sa Renxing writes: Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly revealed the complex contradictory dialectics of the cognitive movement process. The cognitive movement, unlike what some people think, will not achieve complete conformity and absolute consistency between thought and reality all at once, without any inconsistency or unconformity, as long as the worldview is correct. That is impossible. Even if dialectical materialism is mastered, because people's understanding is "often limited by scientific and technical conditions," and "limited by the development of objective processes and the degree of their expression (the aspects and essence of objective processes have not been fully exposed)," it can only guarantee that no major directional errors are made, but it is impossible to completely avoid temporary, partial, or individual errors. The unity of subjective understanding and objective laws is a process, and it is impossible for this process to contain any errors. Therefore, while we have achieved great achievements, it is inevitable that there will be temporary and local shortcomings or errors of no more than "one finger," which is the objective law of the cognitive movement. And this kind of mistake is not terrible. As long as we adopt the correct attitude, it will not only be corrected in time but also become the "precursor of correctness." Comrade Mao Zedong's important principle on the theory of knowledge is the theoretical basis for us to establish a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and it is also the theoretical basis for correctly treating mass practical movements and cognitive movements.

Comrade Shi Cheng is bound by metaphysics and cannot understand these things. According to his viewpoint, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that subjective understanding is either absolutely consistent with objective reality or absolutely inconsistent, either one or the other. And this kind of extreme metaphysical judgment is not uncommon.

Sa Renxing states: In recent years, among a small number of people, there has been a view that all errors in practical work are due to the inconsistency between the subjective and the objective, and that all inconsistencies between the subjective and the objective are caused by an idealistic worldview. Of course, errors in political and organizational lines, as well as consistent and principled errors in work methods and work styles, are closely related to the idealistic and metaphysical worldview, and the idealistic and metaphysical worldview is the ideological basis for making these errors; however, some errors in practical work are caused by limitations of objective conditions, historical limitations, and practical limitations. Therefore, errors must be specifically analyzed. Otherwise, it will not only be unfavorable for people to correct errors in practice but will also bind people's hands and feet, making them afraid to boldly practice or become the theoretical basis for "pointing fingers" behind mass movements. Obviously, this view is unscientific and wrong. This view denies that people's understanding is often limited by objective conditions, and this limitation is objectively real and cannot be transcended by anyone. This view violates the dialectics of cognition and practice. Lenin said: "Kant separated cognition from the object, thereby treating the limited, temporary, relative, and conditional nature of human cognition (its categories, causality, and so on) as subjectivism, rather than as the dialectics of ideas (= nature itself)." ("Philosophical Notebooks") Asserting that all inconsistencies between the subjective and the objective are caused by idealism is to say that some inconsistencies caused by limitations of objective conditions are also idealism; in fact, this is the same as Kant, who "treats the limited, temporary, relative, and conditional nature of human cognition as subjectivism," and violates the dialectics of the cognitive movement, and violates the dialectics of the process of thinking reaching conformity with being. Those who hold this view, without going as far as Kant's agnosticism, probably believe that there is a kind of person who can or has already achieved absolute conformity between the subjective and the objective. If he once discovers that there is no such person or situation, and yet still cannot analyze with dialectics, and still thinks with a metaphysical mind, then he will inevitably go to agnosticism.

Sa Renxing states: "All inconsistencies between the subjective and the objective are caused by idealism" is extremely harmful in practice. Using this view to observe the Great Leap Forward would pour cold water on the mass movement, regard our temporary shortcomings in progress as major problems of an idealistic worldview, and clamor loudly, and make "nitpicking" criticisms of the Great Leap Forward, to the point of denying the Great Leap Forward. Practice has fully proven that the view that "all inconsistencies between the subjective and the objective are caused by idealism" is wrong. The basis of this view is the reflection theory of metaphysical materialism, that is, Comrade Shi Cheng's denial of the unity of opposites between thinking and being, that is, regarding the "conformity" of thinking and being as an absolute and rigid "conformity" that is achieved all at once without containing opposites and contradictions. Therefore, to truly and thoroughly abandon the above-mentioned view that has been exposed as wrong and harmful in practice, it is necessary to criticize the reflection theory of metaphysical materialism and to apply the category of "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between thinking and being, the subjective and the objective, and theory and practice.

The article concludes: In short, the essence of Comrade Shi Cheng's viewpoint is to deny applying "the identity of contradictions" to the relationship between thinking and being, that is, to deny applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, and to adhere to dualism and metaphysics.

### 关于“思维和存在的同一性”问题的争论的实质

专栏：学术论文摘要

    关于“思维和存在的同一性”问题的争论的实质
    “哲学研究”1960年第三期发表了撒仁兴同志的一篇文章：“关于‘思维和存在的同一性’问题的争论的实质”。作者说：关于“思维和存在的同一性”问题的争论，在实质上乃是彻底的唯物主义一元论和二元论倾向之争，唯物辩证法和形而上学之争，马克思主义的认识论和旧的即形而上学唯物主义认识论之争。争论的一方世诚同志的观点，明显地表现了二元论倾向和形而上学，明显地表现了他站在旧唯物主义的反映论的立场。
    世诚同志的中心思想是：否认思维和存在的对立的统一
    撒仁兴同志说：世诚同志断言“思维和存在的同一性”就是思维和存在等同论，从而认为“思维和存在的同一性”只能是唯心主义的原理，认为凡是主张思维和存在有同一性的人就是混淆唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，就是宣扬唯心主义。为了论证他的这种断定，世诚同志硬说恩格斯在“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”一书中把“思维和存在的同一性”当作唯心主义的原理，又从经典著作征引了若干反对思维和存在是同一的话。这就给人造成一种错觉，好似马克思、恩格斯和列宁都是反对、摒弃任何的思维和存在的同一性的。实际上，经典作家只是反对思维和存在等同论，反对存在同一于思维的唯心主义的同一性，而坚持思维和存在的唯物辩证的同一性。
    这篇文章接着说：问题的实质并不在于“同一性”这个词的解释，而在于“矛盾的同一性”适用还是不适用于思维和存在的关系。关于这个问题，世诚同志的答复是完全否定的。世诚同志认为：“思维和存在的同一性”和“矛盾的同一性”是两个不相干的范畴，前者是唯心主义的范畴，后者是唯物辩证法的范畴；如果“把‘思维和存在的同一性’说成是辩证法关于‘矛盾的同一性’”，就是混淆了两个不同的范畴，就是荒谬。作者指出：当然，“思维和存在的同一性”和“矛盾的同一性”不是等一、等同的范畴。但是，两者并不是不相干的，哲学史上有唯物辩证法，也有唯心辩证法。黑格尔把“矛盾的同一性”应用于存在和思维的关系，把存在和思维的同一性解释作同一于精神的辩证同一，这就是唯心辩证法的观点；相反，马克思主义的辩证唯物主义哲学把关于“矛盾的同一性”范畴应用于思维和存在的关系，认为思维和存在的关系既是唯物的（统一于物质）又是矛盾的同一，这就是唯物辩证法的观点。这样把两对范畴联系起来，决不是什么“混淆”，而是把辩证法应用于反映论，坚持辩证法的（即彻底的）唯物主义，坚持唯物主义的（亦即彻底的）辩证法。因此，问题并不是别人在混淆什么，而是世诚同志自己把马克思主义哲学体系中不可分割的唯物主义和辩证法硬是机械地分割开来，陷入了形而上学的泥坑。
    撒仁兴同志说：世诚同志反对把“矛盾的同一性”范畴应用于思维和存在的关系。按照世诚同志看来，最普遍的对立的统一规律，不适用于最高、最大的范畴——思维和存在之间，思维和存在不是矛盾的统一，作为第二性的思维和作为第一性的存在不能在一定条件下互相作用、互相转化，否则就一定是“原则同格论”。世诚同志认为，“原则同格论”主张意识和物、物和意识有着不可分割的联系，唯物主义就应该主张意识和物、物和意识是互不相干的，各自独立，不存在任何联系。世诚同志的这种观点，不仅牵涉到辩证唯物主义的根本原理，而且也牵涉到了唯物主义的一元论和二元论的根本分歧。
    是唯物主义的一元论还是二元论？
    撒仁兴同志说：世诚同志否认思维和存在的对立的统一，就表现了二元论的倾向，按照他的逻辑不可避免地要走到康德，走到二元论和不可知主义。撒仁兴同志就以下三个方面作了分析，批驳了世诚同志的二元论的观点。
    关于思维、意识是不是由存在、物质转化而来的问题，唯物主义认为，意识是物质世界发展到高级阶段的产物。意识的根源在于物质世界，这里就有了存在向思维、物质向意识的转化。唯物主义的一元论，就在于认为存在、物质是第一性的，思维、意识是第二性的，世界的唯一基源是物质。唯心主义的一元论，在于认为思维、意识是第一性的，存在、物质是第二性的，世界的唯一基源是意识。而二元论则认为世界有两个基源——物质和意识。世诚同志否认思维和存在的对立的统一，从而否认意识由物质转化而来，这就必然引导到意识是独立的基源之一。这就是二元论的观点。
    关于思维、意识是不是不依赖、依存于存在、物质的问题，唯物主义认为，意识是人的大脑（高级组织起来的物质）对客观存在的反映。世诚同志否认思维和存在的对立的统一，从而否认思维对于存在、意识对于物质的依赖、依存关系，这就必然引导到思维、意识是独立存在的。这就是二元论的观点。
    关于思维和存在是不是受同一规律支配的问题，辩证唯物主义认为，思维和存在是受同一规律即辩证法的规律支配的，思维的辩证法就是客观辩证法的反映。世诚同志否认思维和存在的对立的统一，从而否认思维依赖、依存于存在，这就必然引导到思维和存在不受同一规律的支配，思维的规律不是客观世界的规律的反映。这就是二元论的观点。
    如上所说：世诚同志否认了思维和存在的对立的统一，切断了“由此达彼的桥梁”，这就必然引导到思维不能认识存在。这又是不可知主义的观点。是消极的反映论，还是“能动的革命的反映论”
    文章的第三部分批评了世诚同志在反映论上站到了费尔巴哈的立场，作者写道：马克思主义的反映论是在承认“没有被反映者，反映就不能存在”的基础上，进一步承认在一定条件下，反映者对于被反映者还有反作用的一面，也就是在一定条件下，客观世界的被改造还有依赖于思维、思维向存在转化的一面。列宁在“哲学笔记”中写道：“人的意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界。”毛泽东同志明确指出：马克思主义的反映论是“能动的革命的反映论”。这是对于马克思主义反映论的最深刻、最科学的概括。撒仁兴同志以毛泽东思想对于中国革命和中国社会主义建设的巨大作用的事实，说明了作为存在的正确反映的思维对于存在的创造作用，这正是意识向存在的转化。
    文章继续说：但是，旧唯物主义的反映论，在承认了思维依赖于存在、思维是存在的反映这个大前提之后，却不承认在一定条件下存在的被改造也依赖于思维、行动也依赖于理论，思维的、意识的东西可以转化为客观的东西。他们把思维看作对存在的消极反映，不起对于存在的能动的革命的改造作用，所以，马克思主义者把旧唯物主义的反映论叫作消极的反映论。世诚同志实质上否认在承认思维是存在的反映之后，又要承认在一定条件下存在的被改造也依赖于思维、思维也可以向存在转化。这样，他就站在了旧唯物主义的消极的反映论的立场，而离开了马克思主义的“能动的革命的反映论”的立场。
    撒仁兴同志说：毛泽东同志不像某些哲学家那样，只是重复“思维是存在的反映”这个唯物主义认识论的基本命题，而是继承马克思和列宁更进一步地把辩证法应用于反映论，进一步发挥思维和存在、理论和实践的辩证法，从而大大地向前发展了马克思主义的认识论。毛泽东同志在“实践论”和“矛盾论”中，一方面承认在历史的总的发展中是物质的东西决定精神的东西，另一方面又充分承认精神的反作用，在一定条件下它可以对于存在的被改造起着决定的主要的作用。这是毛泽东同志对于思维和存在、主观和客观、理论和实践的唯物辩证法的一个重要发展。毛泽东同志始终领导着中国人民充分利用客观规律，高度地发挥主观能动性，和这个哲学观点是分不开的。
    承认不承认在一定条件下实践也依赖于来自实践的理论，存在的发展（被改造）也依赖于作为存在之反映的思维，以及理论、思维在一定条件下转化为客观存在，这不是一个抽象的理论问题，而是一个对实践发生重大影响的问题。按照世诚同志的观点，是无法理解政治挂帅、以虚带实、上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用和人的主观能动性的。
    思维对于存在的反映是一次完成的还是一个过程？思维符合于存在，是有矛盾的符合还是绝对的符合？
    撒仁兴同志指出：旧唯物主义和辩证唯物主义都承认世界是可知的，而且都是从反映论的立场来承认世界是可知的。但是，旧唯物主义不能辩证地理解世界可知性，不能把辩证法应用于反映论、应用于认识过程。因此，它形而上学地认为思维之反映存在是一次完成的，思维之符合存在是绝对的、不包含矛盾的、僵化的、没有发展的符合；而辩证唯物主义则认为认识是一个无限的、辩证运动的过程，思维之符合存在是包含矛盾的，即它们的统一是对立的统一，如此等等，这是马克思主义的反映论和旧唯物主义的反映论的又一个根本的分界线。世诚同志承认反映论、世界可知论，但是他反对思维和存在的对立的统一。那么，他所说的思维和存在的
  “符合”、“一致”，当然就不是包含着对立、矛盾的“符合”、“一致”，而是绝对的“符合”、“一致”；也就是说，思维之反映存在不是一个无限的永远没有完结的过程，而是一次完成的。这难道不是旧唯物主义的反映论吗？旧唯物主义者的一个根本弱点，就是不能把辩证法应用于反映论。世诚同志反对把“矛盾的同一性”范畴应用于思维和存在的关系，否认思维和存在的既对立又统一，所以他不是引出不可知主义的结论，就只能是站在旧唯物主义的反映论的立场。
    征引了毛泽东同志对于思维和存在的矛盾统一过程的论证，撒仁兴同志写道：毛泽东同志深刻地揭明了认识运动过程的复杂的矛盾辩证法。认识运动，并不像有的人所想的那样，只要世界观是正确的，就会一下子达到思想和实际的完全符合、绝对一致，而不会有任何一点不一致、不符合。那是不可能的。就是掌握了辩证唯物主义，因为人们的认识“常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制”，“受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）”，所以也只能保证不犯大的方向的错误，而不可能完全避免暂时的局部的或个别的错误。主观认识和客观规律的统一是一个过程，在这个过程中不包含任何一点错误是不可能的。所以，我们的工作，在取得伟大成绩的同时，也难免发生不过“一个指头”的暂时性的、局部性的缺点或错误，这是认识运动的客观规律。而这种错误并没有什么可怕，只要采取正确的态度，不仅会及时克服，而且会成为“正确的先导”。毛泽东同志的这个认识论上的重要原理，正是我们树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格的理论基础，也是正确对待群众性的实践运动和认识运动的理论基础。
    世诚同志受着形而上学的束缚，对于这一些是不能理解的。按着他的观点，必然引出：主观认识或者与客观实际绝对符合，或者绝对不符合，非此即彼。而这种极端的形而上学的判断，并不是没有的。
    撒仁兴同志说：这几年来，在一少部分人当中，流传着这样一个观点：凡是实际工作中的错误都是由于主观和客观不符合，而凡是主观与客观不符合，都是由于唯心主义世界观造成的。当然，政治路线、组织路线的错误以及工作方法、工作作风的一贯性的原则错误，是和唯心主义、形而上学的世界观密切联系的，唯心主义、形而上学的世界观是犯这些错误的思想基础；但是，有一些实际工作中的错误却是由于受着客观条件的限制、历史的限制、实践的限制而发生的。因此，对错误必须具体分析。否则，不但不利于人们在实践中改正错误，反而束缚人们的手脚，不敢大胆去实践，或者成为在群众运动背后“指手划脚”的理论基础。很显然，这种观点是不科学的，错误的。这种观点否认了人们的认识常常受着客观条件的限制，而这种限制却是客观存在的，也是任何人所不能超越的。这种观点违背了认识和实践的辩证法。列宁说：“康德把认识和客体割裂了开来，从而把人的认识（它的范畴、因果性、以及其他等等）的有限的、暂时的、相对的、有条件的性质当做主观主义，而不是当做观念（＝自然界本身）的辩证法。”（“哲学笔记”）断言凡是主观和客观不符合都是唯心主义造成的，就是把因受客观条件限制而出现的某种不符合也说成唯心主义；这实际上和康德一样，也是把人的认识的“有限的、暂时的、相对的、有条件的性质当做主观主义”，而违背了认识运动的辩证法，违背了思维达到与存在相符合的过程的辩证法。持这种观点的人，没有走到康德的不可知主义，大概是认为有一种人可以或者已经主观和客观绝对符合了。如果他一旦发现了没有这种人、这种情况，而又仍然不能用辩证法进行分析，仍然用形而上学的头脑想下去，那是非走到不可知主义不可的。
    撒仁兴同志说：“凡是由主观和客观不符合都是由于唯心主义造成的”这种观点，在实践上是十分有害的。用这种观点观察大跃进，就会给群众运动大泼冷水，就会把我们前进中的暂时的缺点看作是唯心主义世界观的大问题，而大嚷大叫，就会对大跃进作“吹毛求疵”的挑剔，以至否认大跃进。实践已经充分证明了“凡是主观与客观不符合都是唯心主义造成的”这种观点是错误的。这个观点的基础就是形而上学唯物主义的反映论，也就是世诚同志所持的否认思维和存在的对立的统一，亦即把思维和存在的“符合”看作是不包含对立、矛盾而一下子达到的、绝对的、僵化的“符合”。所以，要真正彻底的抛弃上述那个已经在实践中暴露了是错误的、有害的观点，就非批判形而上学的唯物主义的反映论不可，非把“矛盾的同一性”范畴应用于思维和存在、主观和客观、理论和实践的关系不可。
    文章最后指出：总之，世诚同志的观点的实质，就是否认把“矛盾的同一性”应用于思维和存在的关系，也就是否认把辩证法应用于反映论，而坚持二元论和形而上学。
