    People's Communes Triumph Over Extraordinary Drought
    Hubei Province suffered an unprecedented drought in seventy-two years last year. Relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes, it organized a large-scale drought resistance struggle and finally won a bumper harvest.
    Statements by Representatives Rao Xingli, Guan Musheng, Tian Enbo, and Zhu Guoyun:
    We fully agree with the "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" and the "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget" made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council, and we fully agree with the written work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We would now like to make the following statement on the issue of Hubei Province overcoming the extraordinary drought and striving for continuous leap forward:
    Turning Rivers and Seas Upside Down
    "Fighting drought individually, crying and moaning;
    Agricultural cooperatives fighting drought, pumping water for irrigation;
    People's communes fighting drought, turning rivers and seas upside down."
    This is a song composed by members of the Bailizhou People's Commune in Yidu County, Hubei Province, during the drought resistance efforts last year. In just twenty-seven characters, it writes a history of drought resistance. Taking drought resistance as its theme, it praises the power of the large and public people's communes, and makes a clear comparison between the people's communes and agricultural cooperatives, and between agricultural cooperatives and individual farming. It describes the path of agricultural production development in our country and expresses the farmers' love for the people's communes.
    These twenty-seven characters can only be spoken by those who were once individual farmers, then members of agricultural cooperatives, and are now members of people's communes. Only those who have personally walked the path from individual farming to mutual aid teams, to cooperatives, to people's communes, can appreciate the taste of it. What is this taste? It's like "eating sugarcane from the top, getting sweeter and sweeter as you go!" Who else can more keenly feel the superiority of the people's communes than the members who love them?
    In Hubei Province, from June 30th last year (some were on the 28th, and some places even earlier) until September 20th, for more than eighty days before and after the entire dog days of summer, there was no rain in the province, and some areas were dry for more than one hundred days. Of the province's more than 64 million mu of cultivated land, the drought-affected area reached about 54 million mu. The duration and extent of the drought were unprecedented in seventy-two years.
    After the drought occurred, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly issued a call for drought resistance. The provincial committee and party committees at all levels immediately mobilized 100,000 cadres to rush to the front lines of drought resistance, and organized more than 50,000 workers to go to the countryside to help farmers rush to repair water lifting tools. The vast number of farmers in the province also quickly mobilized, rushing to repair canals, damming rivers, and pumping water to irrigate fields, with about 10 million people投入的抗旱运动. The vast number of farmers and cadres displayed a high degree of revolutionary fighting spirit, "Fearing neither heaven nor earth, determined to resist drought and protect the plan." In the drought resistance struggle, many moving stories emerged. Wang Baling in Duan Yang Production Team of Jiuzhen Commune in Tianmen County is a hilly area with poor soil and a lack of water sources. Before liberation, it suffered from drought nine out of ten years. A folk rhyme circulated among the masses: "Wang Baling is high, drought is like a knife; the bottom of the hill often suffers from waterlogging, rain is a mess; to get a bowl of thin rice porridge, beg for food everywhere." Last year, Wang Baling suffered a severe drought. Since the end of June, not a drop of rain had fallen, the ponds and weirs were dry, and the ditches were cut off. However, under the leadership of the production team's party branch, a comprehensive drought resistance struggle was launched. The entire production team organized 389 laborers and 127 water lifting tools, divided into nine routes, and fought a great battle at Wang Baling. In six days, they dug 32 ditches, and using the ditches and rivers, organized 42 waterwheels, drawing lake water up the hills and ensuring the irrigation of the team's mid-season rice paddies. In the later stages of the drought resistance struggle, after the Central Committee's call for opposing rightist tendencies, promoting vigor, and practicing increased production and thrift was conveyed, it was immediately grasped by the vast number of cadres and masses, and quickly formed an even greater and higher drought resistance upsurge. Thousands of masses marched towards the big rivers, rivers, and lakes, and the water from the Yangtze River and the Xiang River was used to irrigate the fields. In this struggle, the situation in various places was the same as that praised by the members of the Bailizhou People's Commune in Yidu County: the people's communes fully发挥了它的大而公的优越性. Without the people's communes, it would not have been possible to organize such a large-scale struggle.
    Through large-scale drought resistance efforts, the total output of grain and cotton in the province in 1959 decreased by only about 10% compared to the great leap forward of 1958. Some counties not only did not reduce production, but also had a significant increase in production. In 1952, Sui County only suffered a drought of forty or fifty days, and had to调进10 million catties of grain and发放救济款3.1 million yuan; last year, they encountered an even greater drought, but grain output increased by 20% compared to the great leap forward of 1958, and the entire county completed the grain purchase task of 300 million catties ahead of schedule and above quota.
    Harnessing Water and Mountains
    After overcoming the great drought and seizing a bumper harvest, a new situation quickly emerged in agricultural production throughout the province. The characteristic of this new situation is that a new upsurge of mass winter production movements, centered on large-scale agricultural capital construction, has been set off throughout the rural areas of the province. After the autumn harvest last year, autumn plowing was grasped early and plowed deeply. Of the more than 38 million mu of land plowed throughout the province, about 31 million mu were deep plowed six inches or more, an increase of nearly two times compared to the area deep plowed in the previous year. The autumn planting area last year was more than 47 million mu, exceeding the original planting plan by 7.9%, and the speed was twice as fast as in previous years, and the quality was also much better than in previous years. At the same time as autumn plowing and autumn planting, a high tide of agricultural capital construction centered on water management, mountain management, and soil management was set off throughout the province. In the "Three Controls" movement last winter and this spring, 229,000 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects were started throughout the province, of which 210,000 have now been completed, including 342 large-scale water conservancy projects of more than 10,000 mu; 25 million mu of land have been leveled, of which 14 million mu have initially reached the standard of garden-style cultivation; more than 8 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed; 3 million mu of dry land have been converted into paddy fields, and 6 million mu of slope land have been converted into terraced fields.
    Yun County is located in the mountainous area of northwest Hubei, and in the past it was a "poor mountain with evil water" where "water comes and becomes a flood, and water goes and becomes a drought." Before liberation, there were only 60,000 mu of paddy fields, only one small reservoir that could irrigate more than 100 mu of paddy fields, and some small ponds and canals. After ten years of construction, there are now 78 reservoirs, plus other water storage projects, the total water storage capacity has reached more than 67 million cubic meters, and the area of paddy fields has expanded to more than 400,000 mu. In 1959, it suffered a particularly severe drought, but the total grain output still increased by about 10% compared to the great leap forward of 1958. Last year, in conjunction with autumn plowing and autumn planting, a large army for water management, mountain management, and soil management was raised, and construction was started on 218 water conservancy projects; more than 5,000 mountains were turned into terraced fields, with an area of about 600,000 mu; and afforestation was completed on more than 170,000 mu of barren mountains. At the same time, 69 mountains were planted with fruit trees, called "Flower and Fruit Mountains." Comrade Gao Huatang, a famous agricultural labor model and general secretary of the Construction Management District Branch of the Danyan Commune, is the red flag of water management, mountain management, and soil management in this county. He and the masses, under the leadership of the superior party organization, after ten years of exploration, used and developed the experience of Li Dahui of Jun County in diverting water up the mountain and the establishment of the "watermelon seedling" water conservancy system in Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, and finally found a comprehensive method of water management, mountain management, and soil management. Comrade Gao Huatang understood that water management must be done before mountain management and soil management; to manage water, we must trace the source and guide the flow according to the situation, adapt to local conditions, store water, turn stagnant water into living water, and turn water disasters into water conservancy. After several years of efforts, the face of the Construction Management District has fundamentally changed. Now there are thirty or forty layers of terraced fields from the foot of the mountain to the top, and all of them have achieved self-flowing irrigation. The farmers here proudly sing: "Layer upon layer of terraced fields like high-rise buildings, only nine feet nine inches away from the sky, half stretched into the clouds, white rice is to be harvested in the sky." The total grain output here in 1958 increased ten times compared to 1948, and the grain ration standard in 1959 caught up with the most affluent plain areas in the county, and also sold 1.35 million catties of surplus grain.
    On the basis of the great achievements in the province's "Three Controls" movement, agricultural capital construction centered on water conservancy construction has undergone new developments. Its main sign is that hydraulic automatic processing has appeared in various places. This hydraulic automatic processing is built using the hydraulic power of large and small canals, with small investment and large returns. It is a comprehensive utilization of hydraulic power, which will create conditions for the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification in rural areas.
    Excellent Situation
    At present, the people of Hubei Province are fighting for a sustained great leap forward in 1960. To achieve the sustained great leap forward this year, we have fully favorable conditions: First, our people's communes have been in existence for more than a year and have become more consolidated after rectification. The superiority of the people's communes in organizing production and organizing life is becoming more and more obvious. The people's communes have opened up a path for the great development of our agricultural production. Second, our cadres and peasant masses have gained considerable successful experience in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and this year it will be better implemented, which is an important guarantee for increasing agricultural production. Third, on the basis of the water conservancy construction in the past, the water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring has achieved great success, which makes us have more favorable conditions for overcoming natural disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest. Fourth, the tool reform movement has achieved great results in water conservancy construction and transportation. In the future, with the strong support of comrades in factories, mines, and enterprises, further improving the tools for sowing, transplanting, drainage, irrigation, and processing will play a significant role in improving the labor efficiency of agricultural production. Fifth, last winter and this spring, in conjunction with water management and soil management, we have reclaimed 8 million mu of wasteland. These newly reclaimed wasteland will give us an increase of billions of catties of grain. Sixth, last year, the sowing area of our winter food crops expanded by more than 10 million mu compared to 1958, and the growth of barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed in most areas is good. As long as we continue to strengthen field management, a summer harvest is guaranteed.
    Based on the above six favorable conditions, we can have the confidence and certainty to achieve a sustained leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    人民公社战胜了特大旱灾
    湖北省去年遭受了七十二年所未有的大旱。依靠人民公社的强大力量，组织了大规模的抗旱斗争，终于夺得了大丰收。
    饶兴礼、官木生、田恩波、朱国蕴代表的发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春、李先念副总理代表国务院所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，完全同意全国人民代表大会常务委员会的书面工作报告。现仅就湖北省战胜特大旱灾，争取持续跃进的问题作如下发言：
    翻江倒海
    “单干抗旱，哭哭哀哀；
    合作社抗旱，车水灌溉；
    人民公社抗旱，翻江倒海。”
    这是湖北省宜都县百里洲人民公社的社员在去年抗旱中作的一首歌。寥寥二十七字，写出了一部抗旱史。以抗旱为主题，歌颂了人民公社一大二公的威力，并且把人民公社和农业社，把农业社和单干，作了鲜明的对比。它描述了我国农业生产发展的道路，表达了农民对于人民公社的热爱。
    这二十七个字，只有曾经是单干农民，后来是农业社社员，现在是人民公社的社员才说得出来。从单干到互助组，到合作社，到人民公社这一段路，只有亲自走过的人，才能领略此中滋味。这是什么滋味？是“从梢上吃甘蔗，越吃越甜！”还有谁比热爱人民公社的社员更亲切地感受到人民公社的优越性呢？
    湖北省是从去年6月30日（有的是28日，有的地方还要更早）直到9月20日，整个三伏天的前后共八十多天，全省没有下雨，局部地区旱了一百多天。全省耕地六千四百多万亩，受旱面积约达五千四百万亩，受旱时间之久、面积之广，是七十二年来所未有的。
    旱象发生后，中共湖北省委及时地发出了抗旱号召，省委和各级党委立即动员了十万干部，奔赴抗旱前线，并且组织了五万多工人下乡，帮助农民突击整修提水工具，全省广大农民也迅速地动员起来，抢修渠道，拦河筑坝，车水灌田，约有一千万人投入了抗旱运动。广大农民和干部发扬了高度的革命战斗精神，“天不怕，地不怕，决心抗旱保规划。”在抗旱斗争中，出现了许多动人心魄的故事。天门县九贞公社段杨生产队的王坝岭，是一个山岗地，土质坏，水源差，解放前十年九旱，群众中流传一首歌谣：“王坝岭子高，天干一把刀；岗下常受渍，下雨一团糟；要碗稀米汤，四方把饭讨。”去年，王坝岭遭到了大旱灾，从6月下旬起，没下一滴雨，塘堰干涸，沟渠断流。但是，在生产队党支部的领导下，展开了全面的抗旱斗争，全生产队组织了三百八十九个劳动力，一百二十七件提水工具，分九路进军，大战王坝岭，六天时间，就开沟三十二条，利用沟道河流，组织了四十二部水车，把湖水引上了山岗，保证了全队中稻田的灌溉。在抗旱斗争的后期，中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的号召传达下来之后，立即被广大干部和群众所掌握，迅速地形成了一个更大更高的抗旱高潮，成千上万的群众向大江、大河和湖泊进军，长江、襄河的水都被用来灌田。在这场斗争中，各个地方的情形都和宜都县百里洲人民公社的社员歌颂的情形一样：人民公社充分发挥了它的大而公的优越性。没有人民公社，组织这样大规模的斗争是不可能的。
    经过大规模的抗旱斗争，全省1959年的粮棉总产量只比特大跃进的1958年减产一成左右。有的县不仅没有减产，并且还有很大的增产。随县1952年只旱四、五十天，调进粮食一千万斤，发放救济款三百一十多万元；去年遇到更大的旱灾，粮食产量比大跃进的1958年还要增产20％，全县提前超额完成了三亿斤的粮食征购任务。
        治水治山
    在战胜大旱，夺取丰收之后，全省农业生产迅速出现了新形势。这个新形势的特点就是：全省农村普遍掀起了以大搞农业基本建设为中心的冬季生产群众运动新高潮。去年秋收之后，秋耕抓得早，耕得深，全省翻耕的田地三千八百多万亩中，深耕六寸以上的约有三千一百多万亩，比上一年深耕的面积增加将近两倍。去年的秋种面积四千七百万多亩，超过了原来播种计划7.9％，速度比历年快一倍，质量也比历年好得多。在秋耕、秋种的同时，全省掀起了以治水、治山、治土为中心内容的农业基本建设高潮。在去冬今春的“三治”运动中，全省动工兴建大、中、小型水利工程二十二万九千处，现在已经完工二十一万处，其中万亩以上的大型水利工程三百四十二处；平整土地二千五百万亩，其中有一千四百万亩初步达到了园田化的标准；垦荒八百多万亩；改旱地为水田三百万亩，改坡地为梯地六百万亩。
    郧县在鄂西北大山区，过去是“水来成洪，水去成旱”的“穷山恶水”。解放前，只有水田六万亩，只有一个能灌溉水田一百多亩的小水库和一些小塘、小渠道。经过十年建设，现在有七十八个水库，加上其他蓄水工程，全部蓄水量达到六千七百多万立方米，水田面积扩大到四十多万亩。1959年受了特大旱灾，粮食总产量仍旧比大跃进的1958年增加一成左右。去年结合秋耕、秋种，大兴治水、治山、治土之师，动工兴建水利工程二百一十八处；把五千多座山，改成梯田、梯地面积约六十多万亩；在十七万多亩的荒山上完成了植树造林的任务，同时还把六十九座山栽了果树，名叫“花果山”。著名的农业劳动模范、大堰公社建设管理区总支书记高华堂同志，是这个县治水、治山、治土的红旗。他和群众在一起，在上级党组织的领导下，经过十年来的摸索，运用和发展了均县李大贵引水上山和光化县赵岗乡建立“西瓜秧式”水利系统的经验，终于找到了全面治水、治山、治土的办法。高华堂同志懂得了治山、治土，必先治水；要治水，必须追源溯流，因势利导，因地制宜，把水蓄起来，变死水为活水，变水患为水利。经过几年的努力，建设管理区的面貌就根本改变了。现在这里从山脚到山顶有三、四十层梯田，并且都实现了自流灌溉。这里的农民自豪地歌唱：“层层梯田像高楼，离天只有九尺九，半截伸在云霄里，白米要到天上收”。这里1958年的粮食总产量比1948年增加十倍，1959年的口粮标准赶上了本县最富裕的平原地区，并且还卖了一百三十五万斤余粮。
    在全省“三治”运动取得了很大成绩的基础上，以兴修水利为中心的农业基本建设又有新的发展，它的主要标志就是各地出现了水力自动加工化。这种水力自动加工都是利用大小渠道的水力建成的，投资小，收益大，是水力的综合利用，它将为农村实现机械化、半机械化和电气化创造条件。
        大好形势
    目前，湖北省的全体人民，正在为1960年的持续大跃进而战。实现今年的持续大跃进，我们有充分的有利条件：一、我们的人民公社，已经有了一年多的历史，经过整顿更加巩固了。人民公社在组织生产上和组织生活上的优越性，越来越显著了。人民公社为我们农业生产的大发展开辟了道路。二、我们的干部和农民群众，在执行农业“八字宪法”上已经取得了相当多的成功的经验，今年将会得到更好的贯彻，这是农业增产的重要保证。三、在过去兴修水利的基础上，去冬今春的兴修水利运动又取得巨大成就，这就使我们在战胜天灾，保证丰收，有了更加有利的条件。四、工具改革运动在兴修水利方面，在交通运输方面，已经取得了很大的成绩。今后在工矿、企业职工同志们的大力支援之下，进一步改良播种、插秧、排灌、加工工具，这对于提高农业生产的劳动效率，将发挥重大的作用。五、去冬今春，结合治水、治土，我们已经开垦了八百万亩荒地。这些新开垦的荒地，将给我们增加几十亿斤粮食。六、去年，我们的冬季粮食作物的播种面积，比1958年扩大了一千多万亩，很大部分地区的大麦、小麦、蚕豆、豌豆和油菜的生长情况是好的，只要继续加强田间管理，夏季的丰收是有把握的。
    根据以上的六个有利条件，我们可以有信心，有把握地实现今年农业生产的持续跃进。
