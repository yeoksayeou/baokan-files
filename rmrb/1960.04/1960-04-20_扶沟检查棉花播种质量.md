    Fugou Inspects Cotton Sowing Quality

    (Our Dispatch) Fugou County, Henan, completed its task of sowing 150,000 mu of cotton on April 5th. Immediately afterwards, the entire county launched a mass upsurge of inspection and acceptance of "ensuring acreage, ensuring quality, and ensuring full seedling emergence."

    Two hundred and twenty-two inspection and acceptance teams, consisting of 1,250 people, went deep into the fields from April 6th to 11th, taking the commune as the unit. They simultaneously resolved ideological problems, inspected sowing quality, verified land acreage, established archives, issued qualification certificates, and put up signs to determine measures. They inspected the sowing quality and verified the sowing acreage team by team and plot by plot. Through inspection, it was discovered that a total of 5,956 mu of cotton were under-sown in the county; 5,500 mu of cotton fields had five-level channels that were not up to standard; and more than 1,300 mu were not sown to the end or to the edge, and there was also a phenomenon of cotton seeds not being covered tightly.

    The county party committee attached great importance to these problems and immediately convened a broadcast conference attended by more than 200,000 people in the county. It once again publicized and implemented the great significance of taking agriculture as the key link, and simultaneously grasping grain crops and cash crops. It demanded that three major educations be conducted again throughout the county: education on the overall development of the national economy and the great significance of high-speed development; education on the mutual dependence and mutual support of industry and agriculture; and education on the whole country acting as a single chessboard. On the basis of ideological mobilization, the county invested 8,500 laborers in replanting, and after five days of concentrated effort, a total of 8,115 mu were replanted, overfulfilling the sowing plan. At the same time, the communes made adjustments on a commune-by-commune basis for those who could not complete the plan due to actual difficulties. Cotton fields that were not sown to the edge or to the end were immediately replanted by spot sowing and replanting. Artificial covering was carried out for the phenomenon of uncovered soil and exposed seeds; channels that did not meet the standards of garden-style farming were re-repaired.

    扶沟检查棉花播种质量
    本报讯　河南扶沟县于4月5日完成了十五万亩棉花播种任务。紧接着全县开展的一个群众性的“保面积、保质量、保全苗”的检查验收高潮。
    由一千二百五十人组成二百二十二个检查验收组，以公社为单位，从4月6日到11日分别深入田间，边解决思想问题、边检查播种质量、边落实土地面积、边建立档案、边发合格证、边插标订措施，逐队逐块检查播种质量、核实播种面积。通过检查，发现全县共少播棉花五千九百五十六亩；有五千五百亩棉田五级渠道不够标准：有一千三百多亩没种到头、种到边，并有棉种复盖不严的现象等。
    县委十分重视这些问题，立即召开了全县二十多万人参加的广播大会，再次宣传贯彻农业以粮为纲，粮食作物和经济作物同时并举方针的重大意义，要求在全县范围内再次进行三大教育，即国民经济全面发展，和高速度发展重大意义的教育；工农业互相依存、互相支援的教育；全国一盘棋教育。全县在思想发动的基础上，投入补种的劳力达八千五百人，经过五天突击共补种八千一百一十五亩，超额完成了播种计划。同时，各公社对于因实际困难完不成计划的，以社为单位进行了调整。对于没有种到边、种到头的棉田立即进行了点种和补种，对于盖土不严露种籽的现象都进行了人工复盖；对于不够园田化标准的渠道，又重新进行了整修。
