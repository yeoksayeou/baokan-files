    Good! South Korean Brothers and Sisters
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu
    City after city is boiling,
    Millions of fists raised high,
    Water cannons and tear gas all ineffective,
    Millions shout that the traitorous government must be overthrown!
    Look! The old woman straddles a tank,
    Look! The primary school student dares to block the cannon,
    South Korean brothers and sisters,
    You are doing bravely, doing well!
    Pull the speakers and governors off the stage!
    Seize the weapons from the enemy's hands!
    Smash this human hell to smithereens!
    Settle the bloody debt of this pack of jackals for more than a decade!
    Uncover the puppets' wooden heads and foreign cloth legs!
    Drag out the puppeteer behind them!
    South Korean brothers and sisters,
    You are doing it happily, doing it right!

    好啊！南朝鲜的兄弟姐妹
    袁水拍诗　华君武画
    一座座城市沸腾起来了，
    千百万个拳头举得高高，
    水龙头、催泪弹全都失效，
    万众齐呼卖国政府定要打倒！
    看！老太太她跨上了坦克，
    看！小学生敢于挡住大炮，
    南朝鲜的兄弟姐妹，
    你们干得英勇，干得好！
    把议长、知事们拉下台！
    把敌人手里的武器夺过来！
    把这座人间地狱砸它个粉粉碎！
    清算这群豺狼十几年来的血腥债！
    揭开傀儡们的木脑袋、洋布腿！
    揪出他们背后的提线鬼！
    南朝鲜的兄弟姐妹，
    你们干得痛快，干得对！
