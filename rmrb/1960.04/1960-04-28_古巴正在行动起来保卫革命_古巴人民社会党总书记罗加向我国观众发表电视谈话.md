Xinhua News Agency, April 27th – Blas Roca, General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, who is visiting China at the invitation of the CPC Central Committee, gave a speech to the Chinese audience at the invitation of Beijing Television tonight.

    The full text of Blas Roca's speech is as follows:

    In the name of the Cuban people, I extend warm greetings to the heroic Chinese people. The Chinese people are working tirelessly and enthusiastically, and are united unshakeably. They are building socialism, developing their economy, and climbing towards a new life with giant strides.

    It has been exactly four years since I visited Beijing. In such a short period, Beijing has undergone such enormous changes that it is both surprising and delightful to see. The Chinese people have used their magical hands to tear down the old, ugly and uncomfortable things, and have built and continue to build new, beautiful and comfortable buildings. Here we can clearly see the government's and the Party's concern and care for the welfare and cultural life of the masses. The magical hands of the Chinese people have made their capital, Beijing, a city with a long history, even more beautiful and better. Tomorrow, Beijing will be even more beautiful and better.

    I understand that the people of Beijing know a lot about what is happening in Cuba and are very concerned about every event in our revolutionary cause.

    As you know, a real revolution has taken place in Cuba.

    The old regime of imperialist lackeys, large estate owners and great exploiters has been overthrown.

    Today, it has been replaced by a new revolutionary, patriotic, democratic government striving for national liberation and implementing land reform.

    Under the supreme leadership of Castro, the revolutionary government has achieved complete national sovereignty.

    Today, Cuba has a free and sovereign government. It acts according to the will of the people, and not according to the orders of Washington and Wall Street monopolists. This government is only responsible to the Cuban people, and therefore, what it does is beneficial to Cuba and beneficial to the Cuban people.

    Cuba is now carrying out land reform: ending semi-feudal large land ownership, giving land free of charge to tenant farmers and poor peasants, organizing cooperatives, stipulating reasonable prices for agricultural products, and establishing people's stores, where, for the first time, farmers can buy cheap and good-quality products.

    At present, Cuba has begun to develop its industry in a planned way and in accordance with national interests.

    Now, Cuba has begun to trade with the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic and other countries of the socialist camp, as well as some countries outside the socialist camp, seeking to break free from the United States' consistent monopoly of Cuba's foreign trade.

    Today, Cuba has its own independent foreign policy, dealing with international issues according to the interests of the people. Therefore, this policy defends peace and promotes coexistence, exchanges and friendship between countries all over the world. This is fully reflected in the Soviet-Cuban joint communiqué signed on February 13 by A. Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and our Prime Minister Fidel Castro.

    Now, the Cuban people no longer suffer the oppression, torture and killings that they endured for so many years under the Batista dictatorship. Today, the Cuban people truly, widely and effectively enjoy freedom and democratic rights.

    Today, instead of the mercenaries who used to serve imperialism, large estate owners and other exploiters, Cubans have a "rebel army" that grew up in the mountains and serves the sovereignty of the country and the rights and interests of the people.

    U.S. imperialism is extremely angry about this.

    They are angry because the revolutionary government has confiscated, or is confiscating, 120,000 caballeries of land belonging to the United Fruit Company and other imperialist sugar companies.

    They are particularly annoyed because Cuba has become an example for other Latin American countries.

    Since Cuba can have a revolutionary government that does not listen to Washington and does not succumb to Washington's sovereignty, then why can't countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia have such a government?

    Since Cuba can carry out thorough land reform, develop diversified production, transform its economy, and leave aside American monopoly capital and investors, and industrialize its country on its own, then why can't Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru do the same?

    Since Cuba has an independent foreign policy and conducts mutually beneficial trade with countries all over the world, then why do other Latin American countries have to listen to the instructions of Washington and Wall Street?

    Since Cuba was able to overthrow a heavily armed terrorist dictatorship that was actively assisted by the United States and the U.S. military advisory group until the last minute before its collapse, then why can't the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Paraguay also be liberated from similar dictatorships?

    American imperialists are terrified by such examples.

    Therefore, they attempt to isolate Cuba in Latin America, telling the governments of Latin American countries that Cuba is a danger to them.

    But this is a complete lie.

    Cuba does not pose a danger to any Latin American country or government. The only danger faced by Latin American countries comes from U.S. imperialism. It is imperialism that does not allow Latin American governments to govern themselves; it is it that forces austerity plans and causes inflation; it is it that carries out economic aggression against Latin America and plunders their wealth.

    U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Cuban Revolution, and it tries every possible means to strangle the Cuban Revolution.

    U.S. imperialists send robber planes to burn our sugarcane fields, enact laws to reduce Cuba's share of sugarcane imports to the U.S. market, sabotage our economy, exert diplomatic pressure, attempt to put us in a hostile position with other Latin American countries, organize and arm Batista counter-revolutionaries, buy traitors, conspire with Nazi and Falangist adventurers, and plan military aggression against our land.

    In the face of all this, the Cuban people are mobilizing to defend the revolution under the slogan "Homeland or Death" issued by Fidel Castro.

    Cuba does not yet have the necessary armaments, but workers and peasants are donating every penny they have to buy weapons and planes.

    More than 100,000 Cuban men and women have signed up to join the worker-peasant militia.

    If the Cuban people have to go hungry, they will starve for ten years, but they will never surrender to the Washington imperialists.

    If the Cuban people have to sacrifice, they know how to sacrifice, but they will never kneel before the Wall Street bosses.

    We have a reliable revolutionary army. We have a brave, decisive and determined leader in Fidel Castro.

    Our people are united, they organize democracy, oppose and suppress anti-communists and other splitters.

    We are a small island of six and a half million people, located in the throat of imperialism, but determined to fight.

    We have the support of the Soviet Union, China and other countries of the socialist camp, Latin America and the people of the world.

    The friendly Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, are building socialism and fighting back against the conspiracies and attacks of the U.S. imperialists who threaten us and attack us; we have received great assistance from them, and we express our heartfelt gratitude, which the Cuban people will never forget. The concern of the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency for Cuba and the support of the Chinese workers and the Chinese people for the Cuban Revolution expressed in the form of poetry excite every revolutionary Cuban and every Latin American patriot.

    In Latin America, despite the vacillating or hostile attitude of some governments, the scale of the movement supporting us is still very large. In Argentina, a plane is being raised to be donated to Cuba; in Venezuela and Ecuador, volunteers are being registered who will take up arms to defend Cuba when Cuba is invaded. In Chile, various effective support is being provided to us. Everywhere there is strong support for Cuba, and declarations signed by many prominent figures reflect this support.

    With the help of the Latin American people, the Cuban Revolution will surely triumph over the conspiracies and attacks of the imperialists. (Photo attached)

### 古巴正在行动起来保卫革命  古巴人民社会党总书记罗加向我国观众发表电视谈话

    古巴正在行动起来保卫革命
    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加向我国观众发表电视谈话
    新华社27日讯　应中共中央邀请来我国访问的古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加，今晚应北京电视台邀请向中国观众发表了谈话。
    布拉斯·罗加的谈话全文如下：
    我以古巴人民的名义，向英雄的中国人民致以热烈的问候。中国人民不倦地、热情地工作，不可动摇地团结在一起，正以巨人的步伐在建设社会主义、发展本国的经济，攀向一个新的生活。
  正好是四年前，我到过北京。在这么短的时间里，北京发生了如此巨大的变化，叫人看了真是又惊奇，又喜欢。中国人民用它神奇的双手推倒了旧的、既难看又不舒适的东西，建设起了并继续建设着新的、既美丽又舒适的建筑。这里我们可以清楚地看到政府和党对群众的福利和文化生活的关切和照顾。中国人民的神奇的双手把他们的首都，有着悠久历史的北京城建设得更漂亮，更美好了。明天，北京一定更漂亮，更美好。
    我了解北京人民对在古巴发生的事情知道得很多，并且非常关心我们的革命事业的每一个事件。
    你们知道，在古巴发生了一次真正的革命。
    帝国主义走狗、大庄园主和大剥削者的旧政权被推翻了。
    今天代之而起的是一个革命的、爱国的、民主的、争取民族解放和实行土地改革的新政权。
    革命政府在卡斯特罗的最高领导下，取得了完整的民族主权。
    今天，古巴有一个自由的、主权的政府。它是按照人民的意志，而不是听从华盛顿和华尔街的垄断资本家的命令来行事的。这个政府只对古巴人民负责，因此，他所做的是有利于古巴，有利于古巴人民的事情。
    现在古巴正在进行土地改革：结束半封建的大土地所有制，把土地无偿地交给佃农和贫苦农民，组织合作社，规定农产品的合理价格，建立人民商店，在这种人民商店里，农民第一次买到了价廉物美的产品。
    目前，古巴已经开始有计划地，根据民族利益来发展工业。
    现在，古巴已经开始和苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义阵营的国家，以及另外一些非社会主义阵营的国家进行贸易，设法从美国对古巴对外贸易的一贯的垄断下解放出来。
    今天，古巴有着自己的、独立的外交政策，根据人民的利益来对待国际问题，因此，这种政策是保卫和平的，促进世界各国之间的共处、往来和友好的政策。这一点完全反映在2月13日由苏联部长会议第一副主席阿·米高扬和我国总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗所签订的苏—古联合公报中。
    现在，古巴人民已经不再遭受那种在巴蒂斯塔独裁统治下忍受了不知多少年的压迫，酷刑和残杀。今天，古巴人民真正广泛和确实地享受着自由和民主权利。
    今天，代替了以前的服务于帝国主义、大庄园主和其他剥削者的雇佣军，古巴人有着一支在山岭中成长起来的，为国家主权和人民的权利和利益服务的“起义军”。
    美帝国主义对这一点万分恼怒。
    他们恼怒是因为革命政府没收了，或正在没收着属于联合果品公司和其他帝国主义的糖业公司的十二万卡瓦耶里亚土地。
    他们特别感到恼怒的是因为古巴成了其他拉丁美洲国家的榜样。
    既然古巴能够有一个不听命于华盛顿，不屈从于华盛顿的主权的革命政府，那末为什么阿根廷、巴西、哥伦比亚等国家就不能同样地有一个这样的政府呢？
    既然古巴能够进行彻底的土地改革，能够发展多种生产，改造它的经济和把美国垄断资本和投资家抛在一边，自己进行国家工业化，那末为什么厄瓜多尔、玻利维亚、智利、秘鲁不能同样地做呢？
    既然古巴有独立的对外政策，和全世界各国进行互利的贸易，那末为什么拉丁美洲其他国家一定得听从华盛顿和华尔街的吩咐呢？
    既然古巴能够推翻武装到牙齿的、在它崩溃前最后一分钟还得到美国和美国军事顾问团积极帮助的恐怖独裁政权，那末，为什么多米尼加、尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭不能也从类似的独裁政权下解放出来呢？
    美国帝国主义者在这样的实例面前感到胆战心惊。
    因此，企图把古巴在拉丁美洲中孤立起来，同拉丁美洲各国政府说，古巴是它们的危险。
    但是，这是彻头彻尾的谎言。
    古巴对任何拉丁美洲国家和政府不构成危险。拉丁美洲国家所面临的唯一的危险来自美国帝国主义。正是帝国主义，它不让拉丁美洲各国政府进行统治；正是它强制推行节约计划，造成通货膨胀；正是它对拉丁美洲实行经济侵略，掠夺它们的财富。
    美国帝国主义是古巴革命的头号敌人，他千方百计想扼杀古巴革命。
    美帝国主义者派遣强盗飞机焚烧我们的甘蔗园，通过法律减少古巴蔗糖向美国市场进口份额，破坏我国经济，施行外交压力，企图把我们置于同其他拉丁美洲国家敌对的地位，组织和武装巴蒂斯塔反革命份子，收买叛徒，同纳粹和长枪党冒险家们阴谋勾结，并策划对我国土地进行军事侵略。
    面对这一切，古巴人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗所发出的“宁死保卫祖国”的口号下，正在行动起来，保卫革命。
    古巴还没有必备的武装，但是工人、农民把自己每一分钱都捐献出来购买武器和飞机。
    十多万名古巴男女已经报名参加工农民兵队伍。
    如果古巴人民得忍饥挨饿的话，那就饿它十年，但决不向华盛顿帝国主义者投降。
    如果古巴人民得牺牲的话，他懂得如何去牺牲，但决不在华尔街老爷面前屈膝。
    我们有一支可靠的革命军队。我们有着菲德尔·卡斯特罗这样一位英勇、果断和坚决的领袖。
    我们的人民是团结的，他们组织民主，反对并镇压反共产主义者和其他分裂分子。
    我们是六百五十万人的小岛，位于帝国主义的咽喉，但是决心进行斗争。
    我们有着苏联、中国和其他社会主义阵营国家、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的支援。
    友好的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，正在建设社会主义和反击威胁我们、攻击我们的美帝国主义的阴谋和攻击；从他们那里，我们得到了巨大的援助，我们表示衷心的感谢，古巴人民永远不会忘记。人民日报和新华社给古巴的关怀以及中国工人和中国人民用诗歌形式表达他们对古巴革命的支持激动着每一个革命的古巴人和每一个拉丁美洲爱国者。
    在拉丁美洲，尽管某些政府采取动摇的或者敌对的态度，但是支援我们的运动规模仍是非常巨大。在阿根廷正在募捐一架飞机赠给古巴；在委内瑞拉和厄瓜多尔正在登记志愿人员，一当古巴遭受侵略的时候，他们就拿起武器来保卫古巴。在智利，正在对我们进行多种多样的有效的支持。到处都对古巴表示有力的支援，许多著名人士所签名的宣言就是这种支援的反映。
    有着拉丁美洲人民的帮助，古巴革命一定能在帝国主义者的阴谋和进攻前取得胜利。（附图片）
