To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

The Indian Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and has the honor to refer to the Note from the Chinese Government to the Indian Embassy in Beijing dated December 26, 1959. The Embassy, on instructions from the Indian Government, replies as follows:

II. The Indian Government regrets that the Chinese Government has not given full consideration to the points raised in the Indian Prime Minister's letter to the Chinese Premier of September 26, 1959, and in the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Note to the Chinese Embassy of November 4, 1959. The Chinese Government has merely reiterated its claims to large areas of Indian territory and disregarded the facts mentioned in the letter. The Indian Government earnestly hopes that a correct understanding of the facts and historical materials it has presented in support of its position on the border issue will narrow the dispute requiring discussion, thereby paving the way for a friendly solution. However, the Indian Government cannot but regret that the Chinese Government, in its reply, not only fails to accept indisputable facts, but also disregards important boundary agreements, makes untenable interpretations of the terms of the agreements, or doubts the validity of the agreements. This attitude is unlikely to lead to the understanding desired by both countries.

III. The Chinese Government argues that the Sino-Indian border has not been formally delimited, and insists that the border has not been determined by treaties and agreements to support this argument. The Indian Government cannot accept this argument. The Sino-Indian border, based on custom and tradition, runs along natural terrain, and most of this customary and traditional border is also confirmed by treaties and agreements. The entire boundary is fixed and has been well-known for centuries. According to international practice, a customary boundary along well-known, unchanging natural terrain, such as a major watershed, is delimited and does not require further or formal demarcation. It is significant that until recently, no Chinese government has ever raised objections to it or protested against India's exercise of sovereign jurisdiction up to this traditional boundary. In view of all these facts, the Indian Government cannot agree that negotiations must be held to reach a new agreement to redefine the Sino-Indian border.

IV. The Chinese Government says that the current dispute arises from "the fact that the Sino-Indian border has never been delimited, Britain has left behind a legacy of disputes in this regard, and the Indian government has made a series of unacceptable accusations against China." The Indian Government cannot accept the assertions and accusations in this statement. In fact, the current boundary dispute and border tensions arose because the Chinese Government first laid claim to large areas of Indian territory on September 8, 1959, and before and after this, intruded into Indian territory to support its claims. The Indian Government is particularly surprised and shocked that a neighboring country, whose friendship it has always cherished, should adopt such an attitude and actions. Despite these unwelcome events, the Indian Government and people have shown great restraint. The Indian Government has always been willing to explore the possibility of a peaceful solution. However, a friendly solution cannot be reached on the basis of so-called negotiations for a new agreement to redefine the entire Sino-Indian border. Such a basis for negotiation would disregard past history, customs, traditions, and international agreements, and is therefore completely unacceptable to the Indian Government. The Indian Government is willing to reiterate that it is prepared to discuss specific disputes concerning the location of certain places on the border, and to make minor adjustments to the border by agreement where it is deemed necessary.

V. The following paragraphs will briefly outline the basic materials related to the international border, while addressing the arguments raised in the Chinese Government's Note of December 26, 1959.

VI. First, regarding the Ladakh section. The Chinese Government states: The Indian Government believes that the boundary of Ladakh was determined by the 1842 treaty. This statement is incorrect. In fact, the boundary of Ladakh has been determined and recognized since the 17th century. The 1842 treaty did not determine the boundary, but merely confirmed it. Visitors to this area in the 19th century confirmed that the traditional boundary was located where the Indian maps indicate. The Chinese Government cites unofficial maps published by Hayward in 1870 and Robert Shaw in 1871, and an article written by Hayward, to prove its argument that the traditional eastern boundary of Ladakh is located where the current Chinese maps indicate. However, Hayward only surveyed the western end of Aksai Chin, and Shaw's route was located even further west. Therefore, their opinions are not authoritative regarding the eastern part of Aksai Chin. The latter area was surveyed by Johnson in 1865, and the second Yarkand survey team also visited this area in 1873. Therefore, their reports are authoritative regarding the eastern boundary of Ladakh, and their maps and narratives confirm the traditional Indian depiction.

VII. The Chinese Government asserts that the 1842 treaty was between Tibet and Kashmir, and that about 80% of the area now claimed by the Chinese Government was part of Xinjiang. The Indian Government is surprised by this argument. Prime Minister Nehru has already addressed this point in his letter of September 26. The treaty itself shows that China was a party to the treaty. The relevant quote from the treaty is as follows:

"In the presence of God, the ill feelings arising from the war that has occurred have been completely removed from the hearts, and now (all parties) no longer have complaints, and in the future will never in any way deviate from or undermine the alliance, friendship, and unity between His Majesty Raja Sahib Shri Khalsaji and Bahadur Raja and the Chinese Khan (Emperor) and the Guru Lama of Lhasa. We will continue to maintain the limits of the Ladakh frontier and the adjacent areas belonging to it according to ancient customs, without encroaching on or interfering with (countries) beyond the old, established boundaries. We will abide by our respective boundaries."

In fact, this treaty was signed to end the war between Tibet and Kashmir, in which Tibet had sought assistance from China. The statement in the Chinese Note that 80% of this area was part of Xinjiang in 1842 is unfounded. Even Chinese maps from the 18th and 19th centuries clearly show that Xinjiang never extended south of the Kunlun Mountains.

VIII. The Chinese Government states that the proposal to "delimit the boundary" in 1899 came to nothing. This again shows that the facts stated in Prime Minister Nehru's letter of September 26, 1959, have not been taken into consideration. That letter clearly stated that the proposal made by the British in 1899 did not refer to the eastern boundary between Ladakh and Tibet, but to the northern boundary between Ladakh and Xinjiang. The proposal explicitly stated that the northern boundary ran along the Kunlun Mountains to a point east of 80 degrees east longitude, where it met the eastern boundary of Ladakh. This undoubtedly shows that the entire Aksai Chin area was within Indian territory, and that the Chinese Government had not previously objected to this delineation of the boundary. If the 1899 proposal came to nothing, it was not because the Chinese Government refused to recognize the boundary according to the traditional Indian depiction, but because even at that time, the Chinese Government did not consider it necessary to formally delimit the well-known boundary of this area.

IX. The Indian Government has never claimed that the boundary was explicitly delimited in 1842 or 1899. Indeed, since the boundary was determined by custom and tradition and was well-known, there was no need for formal delimitation or demarcation on the ground to recognize it. The Chinese Government says that there is much irrefutable evidence to prove that this section of the Sino-Indian border has not been delimited. In fact, the evidence it presents only shows that the boundary has not been demarcated on the ground. The suggestions made by the British Indian government between 1921 and 1927 only required the determination of the ownership of a few pastures in a specific area. There was no dispute over the major boundary line, let alone a requirement to determine the boundary. The Note cited Sir Olaf Caroe's letter to the London Times on December 11, 1959, on this issue. However, that letter referred to efforts to "demarcate" the boundary "on the ground," i.e., to mark it. The map published by the Survey of India in 1950 noted that this section of the boundary was "undefined" to indicate that it had never been described in detail from point to point or demarcated on the ground. Prime Minister Nehru said in the People's House on August 28, 1959, that this section of the boundary had not been delimited, which only indicated that it had not been marked on the ground.

X. The Chinese Government argues that, apart from the Demchok (Barga) area (which, according to the Chinese Government, was "occupied" by India in recent years), the rest of Ladakh claimed by China has always belonged to China and has been under effective Chinese control. These arguments are completely unfounded. The Demchok area has been part of Ladakh for centuries, as evidenced by the treaty signed between Ladakh and Tibet in 1684 and the accounts of travelers who visited the area thereafter. As for the rest of the area, the claim that most of it was under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang is incorrect. As mentioned earlier, Chinese maps from the 18th and 19th centuries clearly show that Xinjiang never extended south of the Kunlun Mountains. Therefore, no part of this area could have been part of Xinjiang. No part of this territory has ever been part of the Rutog area of Tibet. Moorcroft, who visited this area in 1820, said that Pangong Lake was the boundary between the Rutog area and the Ladakh principality. This actually conforms to the traditional Indian depiction on Indian maps, and not to the depiction on Chinese maps. Strachey, who visited this area in 1847 as a border commissioner, proposed a more specific depiction, which is essentially consistent with the depiction on Indian maps.

XI. It is extremely regrettable that the Chinese Government, without presenting any supporting evidence, claims that the Chinese people have used this area as a place for grazing and salt collection. In fact, these pastures and salt fields have always been retained by the villagers of Ladakh, who have regularly come to these areas; and these villagers have never encountered any Chinese trespassers. The claim that the Chinese government set up border cards here from 1750 to exercise jurisdiction and conduct patrols is incorrect. There have never been any Chinese outposts south of the Kunlun Mountains. Since the 20th century, officials of the Kashmir government and Indian merchants and hunting parties have freely moved in this area without encountering any signs of Chinese jurisdiction in this area. In these years, the Kashmir government and the Indian government conducted detailed geographical surveys of the entire area. Only in recent years have Chinese personnel intruded into this territory; the Indian government is shocked that the Chinese government is using this intrusion as a basis for its claims. The claim that Indian personnel only entered this territory three times, and only in recent years—September 1958, July 1959, and October 1959—is not consistent with the facts. Indian personnel have been patrolling this area regularly. Only in those three instances mentioned by the Chinese government did they encounter Chinese troops.

XII. It is strange that the Chinese government is even raising a linguistic argument, and making claims based on the fact that the names Aksai Chin and Karakash originate from the Uyghur language. There is no need to take this argument seriously. The Indian Government only wants to point out the fact that Indian influence penetrated deep into China, Tibet, and Xinjiang centuries ago, and some place names are derived from Sanskrit or Pahlavi. The name Khotan itself is derived from the Sanskrit "Kustana." Also, the current name of the Ngari region of Tibet is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word "Nari" in the alias Nari Korsum of western Tibet.

XIII. The Chinese Government says in its recent Note that the depiction of the Ladakh boundary in Chinese maps has been basically consistent for two hundred years. Maps published in China were indeed like this until the 1920s, but the boundary lines consistently marked on these maps more or less conform to the traditional depiction on Indian maps. It was only in Chinese maps published since the late 1920s that different depictions were marked. The general trend of recent Chinese maps is to push the boundary line deeper into Indian territory.

XIV. It is extraordinary that the Chinese government is completely unaware of its own official maps, such as the map drawn in 1893, and dismisses the importance of the "New Atlas and Commercial Gazetteer of China," saying that it is a publication of a private institution. In fact, as stated in the preface to the atlas, it is based on authoritative official measurements. However, the Indian Government would also like to draw the Chinese Government's attention to the "Postal Atlas of China" published by the Chinese Government in 1917. This map marks the entire northern boundary of India more or less in accordance with the traditional Indian depiction.

XV. The Chinese Government does not attach importance to the fact that the depiction on Indian maps is along the main watershed. It does not seem to know that the traditional boundary line in mountainous areas always tends to follow the main watershed, rather than any other natural terrain. This is because, of all possible natural boundaries, the watershed is the best, it does not change and is easy to identify. In places with a series of mountains, it is often the watershed, and nothing else, that becomes the traditional boundary, because people on both sides of the mountain tend to settle up to the source of the river, and will not cross them. The fact that the delineation of the northern boundary of India is entirely along the main watershed supports the fact that this line has become the boundary due to custom and tradition. The Chinese government's argument that the watershed boundary of Ladakh cannot be established because a river runs through it is untenable. There are very few major watersheds in the world, no matter how high and continuous they are, that have not been crossed by a river; but this does not affect the fact that it is a watershed. Another argument, that the fact that the area now claimed by the Chinese government is easy to enter from the Chinese side and not easy to enter from the Indian side supports the depiction on Chinese maps, is also untenable. Ease of access is not a criterion for determining the delineation of a boundary.

XVI. The Indian Government is pleased to note that the Chinese Government accepts the depiction on Indian maps of the boundary between the Indian Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh and the Tibetan region, saying that it "conforms to reality." The depiction of this section conforms to the watershed principle, most of which is also marked in this way on Chinese maps. However, the Indian government rejects the Chinese government's claims to certain areas in this section, namely the Spiti area, Shipki Pass, Nilang-Jadh, Barahoti, Sangcha Malla, and Lapthal. Prime Minister Nehru has already cited sufficient material in his letter of September 26, 1959, to prove that these territories have always been part of India. The Chinese Government has disregarded these accurate materials and has merely repeated its claims. In this case, the Indian government does not consider it necessary to repeat what it has said before.

XVII. The Chinese Government also accuses the Indian Government of occupying Poling, one of the trade markets in the Ngari region of Tibet designated by the 1954 Agreement. The Indian Government rejects this statement. The Indian Government does not now, and has never occupied this place. The Chinese Government is confusing this trade market with a place called Polan Sumdo in the Nilang-Jadh area of India. However, the latter location in India has never been a trade market. The coordinates of Poling (also called Poling Sumdo) are 31 degrees 19 minutes north latitude and 79 degrees 27 minutes east longitude. These coordinates were notified to Mr. Chen Jiakang by Mr. Koirala in his letter of March 26, 1954. The coordinates of Polan Sumdo are 31 degrees 18 minutes north latitude and 79 degrees 8 minutes east longitude. During the negotiations leading to the 1954 Agreement, Poling Sumdo (Poling), was mentioned because it was a traditional trade market. It was made clear to the Chinese delegation at the time that Poling Sumdo and Poling were different names for the same place. There was no need to mention Polan Sumdo (31 degrees 18 minutes north latitude, 79 degrees 8 minutes east longitude) at that time, and in fact it was not mentioned in the discussions or in the agreement reached later. Therefore, there is no room for misunderstanding.

XVIII. The Chinese Government argues that the Tibetan authorities hold deeds and household registration and tax registers for these areas it claims, and cites an 18th-century document related to Barahoti as an example. The Indian Government is somewhat surprised to hear this. During the long discussions on Barahoti held by the Chinese and Indian delegations in New Delhi in 1958, the Chinese delegation did not mention the existence of these documents. It may be recalled that the Indian delegation said at the time that they held tax records and other favorable evidence.

XIX. The Indian Government cannot accept the Chinese Government's argument that the residents here are of Tibetan descent and therefore these areas belong to China. In fact, this argument based on ethnic relations was rejected by Premier Zhou Enlai himself as early as July 1957. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the fourth session of the National People's Congress in Beijing on July 9, 1957, "The boundary issue is directly related to the interests of the various ethnic groups living on the Sino-Burmese border. Therefore, special care needs to be taken of the interests of these ethnic groups when resolving this issue. We know that it is common for the border between two countries to divide the same ethnic group living on the border into two. This is the result of historical development. In the sections of the Sino-Burmese border that have been delimited, and on the borders between our country and many other countries, we can see the situation where the same ethnic group lives on both sides of the border. Therefore, when we resolve the issue of the Sino-Burmese border that has not been delimited, we must anticipate in advance that it is difficult to avoid the relevant ethnic groups being separated by the boundary line." In India, people of different races and faiths enjoy the same citizenship. There are thousands of Indian citizens of Tibetan descent. The Indian government encourages the study of Tibetan. These Indian people of Tibetan descent have always been loyal citizens of India.

XX. The Indian Government cannot agree that the agreement signed between India and China in 1954 is irrelevant to the border issue between the two countries. Indeed, neither side requested to discuss the border issue during the negotiations. The Indian delegation did not raise this issue because, as far as the Indian government was concerned, the boundary was well-known, indisputable, and there could be no question about the boundary. Not only did Indian official maps mark the boundary line, but Indian authorities have always exercised administrative control over all areas up to the international boundary line marked on Indian maps. If the Chinese government's claims to any of these areas were serious, it could have been expected to at least mention its claims, if not discuss them. Indeed, Premier Zhou Enlai said at the first meeting that Sino-Indian relations were becoming increasingly close, and that among the outstanding issues, both sides could resolve the issues that had matured. The Indian ambassador pointed out at the time that there were only small outstanding issues between India and China, but he hoped that there would be no outstanding issues between the two countries, whether large or small. Premier Zhou Enlai replied that between two large countries like India and China with a long common border, there would inevitably be some problems, but all problems could be resolved smoothly. Judging from the tone of Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks, it is difficult to infer that he had in mind China's claims to large tracts of land marked as Indian territory on Indian maps and under Indian administration. At the meeting on January 8, 1954, the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the Sino-Indian negotiations were to resolve the outstanding issues that had matured on the basis of the Five Principles. The Indian side accepted these principles as the basis for discussion. The head of the Indian delegation said in his speech after the signing of the agreement on April 29, 1954, "We have fully discussed the issues existing between the two countries in this (Tibetan) region," which showed that in the Indian view, there were no disputes or issues left. The Indian delegation believed from the beginning to the end that all controversial issues between the two countries were under consideration, and that once a solution was reached, there would be no issues left. In view of this, it is surprising that the Chinese side says that Ambassador Raghavan agreed in a supposedly informal conversation that the boundary issue would not be discussed.

XXI. In this case, the Indian Government can only express surprise that the Chinese Government says that the border issue between the two countries was not involved at all in the discussions leading to the 1954 Agreement. When discussing Article Four, which stipulated six passes in this region, the draft proposed by the Chinese delegation was that the Chinese government "agreed to open" these passes. In other words, the Chinese side claimed that these passes belonged to China. The Indian representative, Mr. Koirala, objected to this, stating that these passes were Indian. Therefore, it cannot be said that the issue of the ownership of these passes was not raised at all. The final agreed text was: "Traders and pilgrims of both sides shall travel through the following passes and roads." This can only be interpreted as: the use of these passes does not involve the issue of ownership, because they are border passes.

XXII. The Chinese Government also argued presumptively that the border issue would not be discussed in 1954 because at that time "the issue of greatest concern and urgency to both countries was the establishment of normal relations between India and the Tibetan region of China on a new basis." However, if the Chinese Government had the idea of claiming large tracts of Indian territory adjacent to the Tibetan region at that time, normal relations between India and the Tibetan region of China could certainly not be established. The Chinese government was fully aware of the delineation of the international boundary line on Indian official maps at that time. It must also have known of the authoritative statement made by the Indian Prime Minister in 1950 on the issue of the Indian border. In addition, the Chinese government also knew that the Constitution of the Republic of India, which was adopted after lengthy discussions in open meetings of the Constituent Assembly, explicitly mentioned the tribal areas of Assam and the Northeast Frontier Agency in its Schedule Six, which the Chinese government now attempts to claim as Chinese territory. In the 1954 Agreement, the Chinese government declared its respect for the territorial integrity of India. Under the above circumstances, it would not have done so if it intended to claim large tracts of Indian land in the future. Moreover, when the Chinese Premier held discussions with the Indian Prime Minister in 1954 and 1956-57, he did not indicate in the slightest that his government had claims to large tracts of land. On the contrary, he gave the impression that revising the maps was essentially a procedural matter that would be done someday. The conclusion is obvious that the Chinese Government has changed its position since 1954.

XXIII. The Indian Government cannot accept the argument that the area south of the traditional boundary line east of Bhutan has always belonged to China and has been under Chinese jurisdiction until recently. Before the eighth century, this land belonged to the Varman, Salastambha, and Pala dynasties, and in the eighth century these dynasties succumbed to the pressure of the Ahoms, a branch of the Shan people. Finally, in the thirteenth century, an Ahom ruler controlled the entire kingdom, and the country was named Ahom, which, after softening the pronunciation, is now called Assam. The Ahom rulers ruled this area for nearly six hundred years, until they were finally replaced by British power in India in 1826. In the last years of Ahom rule, control over the northern tribes weakened, but the then Indian government re-established power there after a few years. However, the rulers of Assam never lost sovereignty over these areas, and the Tibetans never gained sovereignty. The tribal areas south of the traditional watershed boundary line have always been part of India.

XXIV. In the 19th century, the British Indian government established power over these tribes, who recognized the right of the British Indian government to maintain law and order in their areas. The mention of British territory in the agreements concluded between the British Indian government and these tribes only meant that such territory was then under the direct administration of the Indian British government, as distinguished from the tribal areas over which it exercised only loose control. But these tribes never ceased to be under the central authority of the British Indian rulers.

XXV. The only evidence that the Chinese government has put forward to support its claim of jurisdiction over this area is concerning the Tawang and Walong areas. But Tawang and Walong only constitute a very small part of the large area now claimed by the Chinese government, and the evidence presented for these two places is not related to the rest of the area. Even in the case of Tawang and Walong, the Chinese government's argument is untenable. Tawang has never been part of Tibet. The local administrative power of Tawang was formerly held by a chieftain, who had some joint village headmen, called Drukien, and village headmen, called Kachung, as his assistants. The only authority exercised by the Lama system in this area was religious. There is now a large Tibetan monastery in Tawang, whose abbot and monks collect religious donations from the local residents who believe in Lamaism. The collection of such religious donations could not and did not give the Tibetan authorities any territorial sovereignty over Tawang. The statement of the Chinese Plenipotentiary at the Simla Conference in 1914 also supports this view. On March 7, 1914, Chen Yi-fan said: "The payment to the Tibetans is not taxation as commonly understood, but merely a donation to the monastery. It is more a charitable contribution than a tax." On June 13, 1914, Sun Baoqi, the Chinese Foreign Minister, notified the British Minister in Beijing that "The Tibetans consider themselves to have authority over all places where Lamas live, but this is not the case. The Lamas may have religious authority, but this does not necessarily mean that these places belong to Tibet."

XXVI. Furthermore, certain Tibetan families had private real estate south of the traditional boundary and collected rent. This rent cannot be considered government tax. It is even possible that such rent was paid after 1914, because the agreement between the Indian and Tibetan representatives on the border protected private property rights.

XXVII. The Chinese government cites the agreement concluded between the British Indian authorities and the Monba people in 1853 and claims that, according to this agreement, the Indian government recognized that the Monba people belonged to Tibet. If this were the case, it should be considered that the British Indian government would have signed this agreement directly with Tibet. In those years, the Tibetan government was indeed conducting independent negotiations, as evidenced by the treaty it signed with Nepal in 1856. In fact, the 1853 agreement was about a specific instance involving a Tibetan, and on that particular occasion, the local chieftains seemed to be acting on behalf of the Tibetan government. Indeed, nine years earlier, these chieftains had accepted British power in India in a written agreement in 1844. The key sentence of the 1844 agreement is as follows: "We also guarantee to carry out any orders issued from the British authorities."

XXVIII. In the Walong area of the Lower Lohit River Valley (which the Chinese government calls Lower Zayu), there are four villages inhabited by Mishmi people and Tibetan refugees. The presence of Tibetan refugees does not prove that this area belongs to Tibet. These refugees have resisted attempts by the Tibetan authorities to collect taxes.

XXIX. It is incorrect to say that the delineation of this section of the boundary in authoritative maps published in India and China conforms to the current delineation of Chinese maps. As has been said before, the Postal Atlas of China published in 1917 delineates the boundary in accordance with the Indian delineation on Indian maps. A map published by Peking University in November 1925 shows the Chinese border at the time of China's greatest expansion, that is, the Qing Dynasty before 1911. Even at that time, the boundary east of Bhutan roughly followed the current delineation. As for Indian official maps, the Indian government has drawn the Chinese government's attention to the Map of India published by the Survey of India in 1895, which marks this tribal area in light orange. From 1938 to 1952, the Survey of India drew this boundary with an undefined mark because the boundary was not actually marked on the ground. However, since the traditional boundary line runs along a major watershed, the Indian government decided in 1954 that demarcation on the ground was unnecessary. Therefore, the undefined mark was removed on subsequent maps.

XXX. The Chinese Government mentioned in this regard the Map of India in 1945 attached to the third edition of the English version of Mr. Nehru's book "The Discovery of India." This specific map is a sketch map added by the publisher, and the author cannot be held responsible for its inaccuracies. No adverse conclusions should be drawn from this against the Indian government.

XXXI. The Indian Government regrets that the Chinese Government insists on questioning the legal validity of the 1914 agreement between India and Tibet on determining the traditional boundary east of Bhutan. This is not the first time that Tibet has exercised its right to negotiate and conclude treaties with foreign countries. Before 1914, Tibet had negotiated and concluded treaties with foreign countries several times. For example, Tibet concluded a treaty with Nepal in 1856 and a treaty with Britain in 1904. These treaties have never been opposed by China and are fully valid. At the Simla Conference, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary and the Chinese Plenipotentiary met on an equal footing. The Chinese government explicitly and unequivocally agreed to this situation. The three plenipotentiaries exchanged credentials at the first meeting on October 13, 1913. The credentials issued by the Dalai Lama to the Tibetan representative clearly stated that Tibet was an equal party at the meeting and had the right to "decide various issues beneficial to Tibet," and the Chinese representative considered the credentials of the Tibetan representative to be in good order. The Chinese representative also agreed to the credentials of the British Indian representative, which affirmed that the three representatives had equal status and that the meeting was convened "to adjust relations between the various governments."

XXXII. It is incorrect to say that the agreement on the Indo-Tibetan border concluded by India and Tibet in March 1914 was secret. This is an agreement concluded by authoritative representatives of both sides after full discussion and approved by the Tibetan government. Therefore, there is nothing surreptitious about it. Furthermore, the Indo-Tibetan border was delineated on the map attached to the tripartite treaty, and the Chinese representative also signed this map on April 27, 1914. The 1914 border agreement was published in the 1929 edition of Aitchison's "A Collection of Treaties, Engagements, and Sanads," and the previous edition was published as early as 1909. The Chinese government has never protested against this agreement. In fact, even before this agreement, the British Indian government had established its authority over these tribal areas, concluded agreements with the tribes, and created two border areas covering this entire area. These facts were well-known, and neither the Tibetan nor the Chinese government objected to the British Indian authorities.

XXXIII. The Indian Government cannot agree with the Chinese Government's statement that only the boundary line between China and Tibet and between Outer Tibet and Inner Tibet was discussed at the Simla Conference. It is also incorrect to say that the red line on the treaty map signed by the Chinese representative only represents the boundary line between Tibet and other parts of China, and it has never been stated that a part of this red line is the boundary line between China and India. The sophistry that the McMahon Line part of the red line on the treaty map represents the boundary between Tibet and China is absurd. Article 9 of the treaty initialed by the Plenipotentiaries of British India, China, and Tibet deals with the border issues of Tibet, and the map attached to the treaty clearly shows the border between Tibet and India. This is the boundary line commonly known as the McMahon Line. The Postal Atlas of China published by the Chinese government in 1917 draws this line as the boundary between India and Tibet and marks the area south of the line as India. Now, no matter how exaggerated the imagination, it is impossible to insist that there was any Chinese territory south of the McMahon Line at that time. The claim that the red line represents the boundary between Tibet and China contradicts the Chinese government's own claim that the area south of the line is under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan authorities rather than the Chinese government.

XXXIV. It is strange that the Chinese government now wants to rely on the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 and argues that the conditions of 1914 are invalid because Britain was bound by the treaty of 1907 and could not negotiate directly with Tibet. China is not a party to the Anglo-Russian Treaty and cannot cite that treaty to support its argument. In fact, throughout the negotiation process, the Russian government was fully informed of the progress of the negotiations. A copy of the treaty, including the map, was sent to the Russian government, and the Russian government did not object to the negotiations or the subsequent treaty.

XXXV. The Chinese Note refers to the four protests made by the Chinese government in 1946-47. It can be stated that these protests were made against the actions of the British Indian administrative authorities in a small place in the Northeast Frontier Agency in 1943. The Indian government replied at the time that "The only activities carried out by the Indian government in the area are entirely limited to the Indian side of the Indo-Tibetan border, which has been accepted for more than 30 years." The Kuomintang government's protest in November 1949 merely stated that China had not signed the Simla Treaty. India did not respond to this protest because shortly thereafter, the Indian government recognized the People's Republic of China in December 1949. A few months later, in its Note to the Chinese government in August 1950, the Indian government mentioned that the recognized border between Tibet and India should not be violated. In the same year, the Indian Prime Minister publicly announced that India insisted on the McMahon Line. Therefore, there can be no doubt about the Indian government's position on the international border.

XXXVI. The Tibetans have never protested against the Indo-Tibetan border agreed upon in 1914. They have recognized the existence of this boundary line more than once and have stated that they do not want to dispute its validity. When the representatives of British India verbally reiterated the McMahon Line in 1936 and 1938, the Tibetan government replied that it was fully aware of the terms of the 1914 agreement. On the contrary, the Indian government protested against the illegal infiltration of Indian territory by the Tibetans in 1943. The Indian government made the same protest whenever the Tibetans attempted to collect illegal taxes in Indian territory while India was busy with other matters. The Indian government protested, and the Tibetans withdrew. Prime Minister Nehru's letter of September 26, 1959, has fully addressed the absurd demands made by the Tibetans in 1947.

XXXVII. The Chinese government knows all the special treaty relations that the Indian government has with Bhutan and Sikkim. Therefore, the Indian government welcomes the Chinese Note's interpretation of the border between Sikkim and Bhutan on one side and Tibet on the other. The Note states that the boundary between Sikkim and the Tibetan region of China has long been formally delimited, and there are no differences on the map or any disputes in practice. The Indian government would like to add that this boundary has also been marked on the ground. As for Bhutan, its northern boundary is traditional and well-known. To the east of Bhutan is the Northeast Frontier Agency of India, and the boundary between this area and Tibet is traditional and also delimited by agreement. Therefore, there cannot be any Tibetan territory south of the McMahon Line. The Indian Government is pleased to note that the Chinese Government has not repeated its claims on any part of northern Bhutan on the map. In view of the Indian Government's responsibility for defending and maintaining the integrity of Bhutan and Sikkim, the Indian Government welcomes the Chinese Government's assurance that it will not infringe on the territory of Sikkim and Bhutan.

XXXVIII. The above paragraphs have briefly elaborated on the substantive points related to the Sino-Indian border issue. The Indian government can only express its regret that the Chinese government has repeated its original statements regarding the Longju incident and the Kongka Pass incident in the Chang Chenmo River Valley. The truth about these events has been communicated to the Chinese government in India's previous Notes. The points raised in those Notes have not yet been answered. It only needs to be pointed out that if the Chinese personnel really entered Longju only five days after the Indian personnel withdrew, the casualties of the Indian personnel cannot be explained. Similarly, Mr. Karam Singh's detailed account given to the Chinese Embassy in Delhi on November 24, 1959, refutes the Chinese government's statement regarding the

    印度共和国驻华大使馆1960年2月12日给中华人民共和国外交部的照会北京，中华人民共和国政府外交部
    印度大使馆向中华人民共和国外交部致意，并谨提到中国政府1959年12月26日交给印度驻北京大使馆的照会。大使馆奉印度政府指示，答复如下：
    二、中国政府没有充分考虑印度总理1959年9月26日给中国总理的信和印度外交部1959年11月4日交给中华人民共和国大使馆的照会中所提出的各点，印度政府对此感到遗憾。中国政府只是重申了它对印度领土广大地区的要求，而漠视了信中所提到的事实。印度政府殷切地希望，对它所提出来支持它在边界问题上的立场的事实和历史材料的正确理解，会缩小须加讨论的争端，从而为友好的解决铺平道路。然而，印度政府不能不遗憾地说，中国政府在来照中不仅不接受无可辩驳的事实，而且无视了重大的边界协定，对协定的条款作了站不住脚的解释或者怀疑了协定的有效性。这种态度很难导致两国都希望达到的谅解。
    三、中国政府辩称，中印边界未经正式划定，并且为支持这种论点而硬说边界并未经条约和协定所确定。印度政府不能接受这个论点。以习惯和传统为基础的中印边界是沿着天然的地形，而且这条习惯传统边界的大部分也是为条约和协定所确认的。整个边界是固定了的，并且多少世纪来一直是众所周知的。根据国际惯例，沿着众所周知的、不变的天然地形像主要分水岭的习惯边界，就是划定了的，不需要进一步的或正式的划界。有意义的是，直到最近，没有任何中国政府曾对它提出异议，或者对于印度行使主权管辖直到这条传统边界一事提出抗议。鉴于所有这些事实，印度政府不能同意必须举行谈判，达成新的协议，来重新确定中印边界。
    四、中国政府说，产生目前的争论是由于“中印边界一直没有划定，英国在这方面又留下了一些纠纷的遗产，而印度政府又对中国进行了一系列令人不能接受的指责”。印度政府不能接受这句话里的断语和指责。事实上，目前关于边界的争端和边境紧张局势的产生是由于中国政府在1959年9月8日第一次对大片的印度领土提出要求，并且在此以前和以后侵入了印度领土来支持它的要求。印度政府一贯珍视其友谊的一个邻邦竟采取这种态度和行动，这使印度政府感到特别诧异和震惊。尽管有这些不受欢迎的事情，印度政府和人民表现了极大的克制。印度政府一向愿意探索和平解决的可能性。但是，不能够在所谓必须谈判新的协议来重新确定整个中印边界的基础上来达到友好的解决。这样一个谈判的基础会无视过去的历史、习惯、传统和国际协定，因此是印度政府所完全不能接受的。印度政府愿意再次表明，它准备就有关边界上某些地方的位置的具体争端进行讨论，并且在认为必要的地方通过协议对边界作小的修正。
    五、下列各段将简述有关国际边界的基本材料，同时论及中国政府1959年12月26日照会中所提出的论点。
    六、首先谈拉达克的一段。中国政府说：印度政府认为拉达克的边界是1842年条约所确定的。这种说法是错误的。事实上，从十七世纪以来，拉达克的边界就确定了，并且得到承认。1842年条约并不是确定边界，而只是确认了它。十九世纪时访问过这个地区的人，确认这条传统边界是位于印度地图所标明的地方。中国政府引用了海华德在1870年和罗伯特·肖在1871年所出版的非官方地图和海华德所写的一篇文章，来证明它的论点，即所谓拉达克的传统的东部边界是位于目前中国地图所标明的地方。但是，海华德只是勘测了阿克赛钦的西端，而肖的路线位于甚至更西边的地方。因此，他们的意见对于阿克赛钦东部不是权威性的。后一块地区是约翰逊在1865年勘测的，1873年第二个叶尔羌调查团也访问过这个地区。因此，关于拉达克东部边界，他们的报告才是权威性的，而他们的地图和叙述证实了传统的印度的画法。
    七、中国政府断言，1842年条约是西藏和克什米尔之间的，而现在中国政府所要求的地区的80％左右是新疆的一部分。印度政府对这一论点感到惊讶。尼赫鲁总理在他9月26日的信中已经谈到过这一点。条约本身表明中国是条约的一方。条约中有关的引语如下：
    “鉴于在上帝的面前，由曾经发生的战争所产生的恶感已经完全从心中消除了，现在（各方）都不再有抱怨，今后将无论如何永不丝毫背离或破坏世界之王赫沙吉大人和巴哈杜尔大君同中国可汗（皇帝）和拉萨的古鲁喇嘛之间的同盟、友好和团结。我们将继续保有拉达克边疆的极限和按照古老的习惯属于它的毗邻地区，而不对老的、确定了的边界以外（的国家）进行侵犯或干涉。我们将遵守各自的边界。”
    事实上，签订这个条约是为了结束西藏对克什米尔的战争，在这个战争中西藏曾向中国求援。中国照会中说，这个地区的80％在1842年是新疆的一部分，这是没有根据的。甚至十八、十九世纪的中国地图也清楚地表明新疆从来没有延伸到昆仑山脉以南。
    八、中国政府说，1899年“划定边界”的建议并无任何结果。这再一次表明没有把印度总理1959年9月26日信中所述的事实考虑进去。那封信里清楚地说明，英国人在1899年提出的建议并不是指拉达克东部与西藏的边界，而是指拉达克北部与新疆的边界。那个建议明文说到，北部边界沿昆仑山脉到东经八十度以东的一点，在此和拉达克的东部边界相接。这毫无疑问地表明，整个阿克赛钦地区都在印度领土之内，而且中国政府过去没有反对过边界的这一划法。如果1899年的建议并无结果，这不是因为中国政府不肯按照印度地图所标明的传统画法来承认边界，而是因为即使在当时，中国政府看来也不认为有必要对这个地区的众所周知的边界进行任何正式的划定。
    九、印度政府从来没有主张说，边界在1842年或1899年就明确划定了。的确，既然边界是为习惯和传统所确定了的，而且是众所周知的，就没有必要进行正式划定或在地面上标界来加以承认。中国政府说有很多无可辩驳的证据来证明中印边界的这一段是未经划定的。事实上，它所提出的证据只表明边界未曾在地面上标定。当时英属印度政府在1921年到1927年间所提出的建议，只是要求确定在一个特定地区里少数几块牧场的归属问题。对主要的界线是不存在争执的，更不用说要求确定边界了。来照在这个问题上曾引用了罗西安爵士1959年12月11日在伦敦泰晤士报的投书。但是，这封信所谈到的是试图“在地面上”划界，即标界的努力。印度测量局1950年所出版的地图注明这段边界“未经规定”，以表明这段边界从来没有从一点到一点详细地描述或在地面上标定。印度总理1959年8月28日在人民院说，这段边界未曾划定过，这只是表明没有在地面上标明过。
    十、中国政府辩称，除碟穆绰克（巴里加斯）地区（据中国政府说，这个地区最近几年被印度“侵占”）外，中国所要求的拉达克的其余部分一直属于中国，并且是在中国的有效控制之下。这些论点是完全没有根据的。碟穆绰克地区多少世纪来一直是拉达克的一部分，这是为1684年拉达克和西藏间所签订的条约和此后访问过这个地区的旅行家的记载所证明了的。至于该地区的其余部分，所谓大部分是在新疆管辖之下的说法是不正确的。如前所述，十八、十九世纪的中国地图清楚地表明，新疆从未延伸到昆仑山脉以南。因此，这个地区的任何部分都不可能曾是新疆的一部分。这块领土的任何部分也不曾是西藏日土宗的一部分。曾在1820年访问过这个地区的穆尔克拉夫脱说，班公湖是日土宗地区与拉达克公国间的分界。这点实际上符合印度地图所标明的传统画法，而不符合中国地图上的画法。1847年以边境专员身份访问过这个地区的斯特拉彻提出了一个更具体的画法，这个画法实质上和印度地图上的画法相符。
    十一、极为遗憾的是，中国政府没有提出任何支持的证据，而竟说中国人民曾把这地区用作放牧和采盐的场所。事实上，所述的这些牧场和采盐场一直是拉达克村民所保有的，他们一直定期地到这些地区来；而这些村民从未遇到过任何中国的越境者。所谓1750年起中国政府就设立边卡，对这里行使管辖、进行巡逻的说法，是不正确的。在昆仑山脉以南，从来没有过任何中国的哨所。二十世纪以来，克什米尔政府的官员和印度商人和打猎队在这个地区自由地走动，不曾碰到过任何中国人在这个地区行使管辖的迹象。在这些年代里，克什米尔政府和印度政府对整个地区进行了详细的地理勘测。只是最近几年，中国人员才侵入了这块领土；中国政府竟用这一入侵作为要求的根据，印度政府对此感到震惊。所谓印度人员只有三次，而且是在最近几年——1958年9月，1959年7月和1959年10月——进入这块领土的说法，是不符合事实的。印度人员一直定期地在这个地区巡逻。只有在中国政府所提到的那三次，他们才碰上了中国部队。
    十二、奇怪的是，中国政府竟举出一个以语言学为基础的论点，并且根据阿克赛钦和喀拉喀什这些名字起源于维吾尔语的事实提出了要求。没有必要严肃地对待这个论点。印度政府只想指出一个事实，即在几世纪以前印度的影响曾深入中国，西藏和新疆有一些地名是起源于梵文或帕拉文。和阗这个名字本身就是从梵文“库斯达那”演变来的。还有，西藏阿里地区的现在的名字，是西藏西部的别名纳里·噶尔松中的梵文字“纳里”的缩称。
    十三、中国政府在它最近的照会中说，二百年来中国地图中对拉达克边界的划法基本上是一致的。直到本世纪二十年代，中国出版的地图确实是这样的，但是这些地图一致标明的边界线，或多或少是和印度地图上所标明的传统划法相符的。只是在二十年代末年以来出版的中国地图中，才标出了不同的划法。晚近中国地图的大致趋向，是把边界线更深地推入印度领土。
    十四、异乎寻常的是，中国政府竟对自己的官方地图，如对1893年画的地图，一无所知，并且抹煞“中国新地图和商业地志”的重要性，说它是私人机构的出版物。事实上，正如该图集序言中所说的，它是以权威性的官方测量为根据的。然而，印度政府还愿提请中国政府注意中国政府于1917年出版的“中华邮政舆图”。这幅地图所标明的整个印度北部边界或多或少是符合于印度传统的画法的。
    十五、中国政府并不重视这一事实，即印度地图所标明的画法是沿着主要的分水岭的。它似乎不知道在山区的传统边界线总是倾向于沿着主要的分水岭，而不是依照任何其他的天然地形。这是因为，在所有可能的天然边界线中，分水岭是最好的，它不会改变，而且易于辨认。在有一系列山脉的地方，往往是分水岭，而不是别的东西，成为传统的边界，因为山两边的人民在定居时倾向于上溯到河流发源地为止，而不会越过它们。印度北方边界的划法全部是沿着主要的分水岭，这一点支持了这条线由于习惯和传统而成为边界的事实。中国政府所谓拉达克的分水岭边界由于有一条河穿过这里而不能成立的论点是站不住脚的。世界上很少有任何主要的分水岭，不管它多高和连绵不断，没有被某条河流所穿过；但是这并不能影响它作为分水岭的事实。另外一个论点，即所谓现在中国政府所要求的地区容易从中国方面进入而不容易从印度方面进入的事实支持了中国地图的画法这个说法，同样也是站不住脚的。是否容易进入并不是确定边界画法的标准。
    十六、印度政府高兴地注意到，中国政府接受了印度地图关于印度旁遮普、喜马偕尔省和北方省与西藏地方之间的边界的划法，说它
  “符合实际”。这一段的画法是符合分水岭原则的，其中大部分在中国地图上也标明了这种画法。然而印度政府拒绝中国政府对这段上某些地区的要求，即司丕提地区、什布奇山口、尼兰—贾德汗、巴拉霍蒂、香札马拉和拉不底。印度总理在1959年9月26日的信中已经举出充分的材料证明这些领土一直是印度的一部分。中国政府无视这些确切的材料，而只是重复了自己的要求。在这种情况下，印度政府认为没有必要重复它以前说过的话。
    十七、中国政府还指责印度政府占领了1954年协定指定为西藏阿里地区贸易市场之一的波林三多。印度政府拒绝这种说法。印度政府现在没有，而且从来没有占领这个地方。中国政府是把这个贸易市场同印度尼兰—贾德汗地区的一个叫波兰松多的地方混淆了起来。然而，印度境内的后一地点从来也不是贸易市场。波林三多（也叫波林）的座标是北纬三十一度十九分，东经七十九度二十七分。这个座标已由高尔先生在1954年3月26日的信中通知了陈家康先生。波兰松多的座标是北纬三十一度十八分，东经七十九度八分。在导致1954年协定的谈判期间，被提到的是波林三多（波林），因为它是一个传统的贸易市场。当时就向中国代表团说清楚，波林三多和波林是同一个地方的不同名称。当时没有必要提到波兰松多（北纬三十一度十八分，东经七十九度八分），而且事实上在讨论中和后来达成的协定中都没有提到它。因此，不存在任何误解的余地。
    十八、中国政府辩称，西藏当局持有有关它所要求的这些地区的地契和户口、税收簿册，并且举出十八世纪有关巴拉霍蒂的一个文件为例。印度政府听到这一点有些惊奇。在1958年中印代表团在新德里就巴拉霍蒂举行的长期讨论中，中国代表团没有提到存在着这些文件。可以忆及，印度代表团在当时说，他们持有税收记录和其他有利的证据。
    十九、印度政府不能接受中国政府关于这里的居民属于藏族血统，因此这些地区属于中国的论点。实际上，这种基于种族关系的论点早在1957年7月就被周恩来总理本人驳斥过了。1957年7月9日周恩来总理在北京全国人民代表大会第四次会议上讲话说，“边界问题直接地关系到聚居在中缅边境的各民族的利益。因此，在解决这个问题的时候，就特别需要照顾这些民族的利益。我们知道，两国之间的边界把聚居在边境的同一民族划分为二，是常见的事。这是历史发展的结果。在中缅已定界的各段，在我国和许多其他国家的边界上，我们都可以看到同一个民族分居边界两旁的情况。因此我们在解决中缅未定界问题的时候必须事先估计到，有关民族被边界线分隔是难以避免的。”在印度这个国家里，不同种族和信仰的人享有同样的公民资格。藏族血统的印度公民数以千计。学习藏文是印度政府所鼓励的。这些藏族血统的印度人一向是印度的忠实的公民。
    二十、印度政府不能同意：1954年印中之间签订的协定与两国边界问题无关。的确，在谈判过程中双方都没有要求讨论边界问题。印度代表团没有提出这个问题，因为，就印度政府来说，边界是人所共知的，是无可争论的，不可能存在有关边界的问题。不仅印度官方地图标明了边界线，而且印度当局对所有地区都一向行使着行政控制，直到印度地图所标明的国际边界线为止。如果中国政府对这些地区中的任何一块所提出的要求是态度严肃的话，可以期望它至少会提到它的要求，如果不加以讨论的话。的确，周恩来总理在第一次会晤时说过，中印关系日益密切，在悬而未决的问题中，双方可以解决业已成熟的问题。印度大使当时指出，印中之间未决的只有小问题，但是他希望两国间不留存任何悬而未决的问题，不论是大是小。周恩来总理回答说，像印度和中国这样两个有着漫长的共同边界的大国之间，必然会有一些问题，但是所有的问题都可以顺利地解决。从周恩来总理这段话的上下语气来看，很难得出推论说，他心目中有着中国对印度地图标明为印度领土并且在印度管理下的大片土地提出的要求。在1954年1月8日的会议上，中国外交部副部长说，中印谈判是要根据五项原则解决业已成熟了的悬而未决的问题。印度方面接受了这些原则作为讨论的基础。印度代表团团长在1954年4月29日协定签字后的讲话中说：“我们已经充分讨论了在这个（西藏）地区存在于两国之间的问题”，这表明了在印度方面看来，没有遗留任何争端或问题了。印度代表团自始至终认为，两国间所有争论的问题都在考虑之中，并且一旦达成解决，就不存在任何问题了。有鉴于此，中国方面竟说赖嘉文大使在一次据说是非正式的谈话中同意将不讨论边界问题，这是令人惊异的。
    二十一、在这种情况下，中国政府竟说在导致1954年协定的讨论过程中根本没有涉及两国边界问题，印度政府只能表示惊异。当讨论在这个地区规定六个山口的第四条时，中国代表团提出的草案是，中国政府“同意开放”这些山口。换言之，中国方面主张这些山口是属于中国的。印度代表高尔先生对此提出反对，他申明这些山口是印度的。因此，不能说这些山口的归属问题根本没有被提出。最后取得协议的条文是：“双方商人和香客经由下列山口和道路来往”。这只能被解释为：使用这些山口不牵涉到归属的问题，因为它们是边界山口。
    二十二、中国政府还以根据推想辩解说，边界问题不会在1954年进行讨论，因为当时“两国所最关切和亟需解决的问题，是印度同中国西藏地方在新的基础上建立正常关系的问题”。但是，如果中国政府当时就对邻接西藏地方的大片印度领土抱有要求的想法的话，印度和中国西藏地方之间的正常关系当然是建立不起来的。中国政府当时完全知道印度官方地图对国际边界线的画法。它也一定知道1950年印度总理就印度边界问题所作的权威性的声明。此外，中国政府也知道，经过制宪议会公开会议长时间讨论后通过的印度共和国宪法，在它的附表六中明确提到阿萨姆的各部落区和东北边境特区，中国政府现在企图把这些地方说成是中国的领土。在1954年协定中，中国政府申明尊重印度的领土完整。在上述情况下，如果它想在以后对印度的大片土地提出要求的话，它是不会这样做的。况且，中国总理在1954年和1956—57年之交同印度总理进行讨论时，丝毫没有表示他的政府对大片土地有要求，恰恰相反，他给人的印象是，修改地图本质上是一个程序问题，总有一天会做到的。结论很明显，从1954年以来，中国政府改变了它的立场。
    二十三、印度政府不能接受这种论点，即不丹以东传统边界线以南的地区一向属于中国，而且直到最近还在中国的管辖下。在八世纪以前，这片土地一直属于瓦曼、萨拉斯塔姆巴和帕拉王朝，到了八世纪这些王朝屈服于掸族的一个支系阿霍姆人的压力之下。最后，到十三世纪时，阿霍姆的一个统治者控制了整个王国，并且这个国家命名为阿霍姆，经过发音软化，现在叫阿萨姆。阿霍姆统治者在这个地区统治了近六百年，最后到1826年为英国在印度的权力所取代。在阿霍姆统治的最后几年中，对北部部落的控制减弱了，但是当时的印度政府经过几年又在那里重新建立了权力。然而，阿萨姆的统治者从来没有失去对这些地区的主权，西藏人从来没有取得主权。传统分水岭边界线以南的部落地区一向是印度的一部分。
    二十四、在十九世纪，英属印度政府建立了对这些部落的权力，这些部落承认英属印度政府有权在他们的地区维持法律和秩序。在英属印度政府同这些部落缔结的协定中提到英国人的领土，这只是意味着这种领土当时是在印度英国政府的直接管理之下，以区别于它只行使松懈的控制的部落地区。但是这些部落从来没有停止处于英属印度统治者的中央权力之下。
    二十五、中国政府提出来支持他们对这个地区的管辖权的要求的唯一证据，是关于达旺和瓦弄地区。但是达旺和瓦弄只构成中国政府现在要求的大片土地的一个极小的部分，而且就这两个地方提出的证据是同该地区的其余部分没有关系的。即便就达旺和瓦弄来说，中国政府的论点也是不能成立的。达旺从来也不是西藏的一部分。达旺的地方管理权过去掌握在一个土王手里，他有一些联村头人，叫卓里恩，和村落头人，叫卡充，做他的助手。喇嘛系统在这个地区行使的唯一职权是宗教方面的。现在在达旺有一个很大的西藏寺院，它的主持和和尚向当地信奉喇嘛教的居民征收宗教捐。征收这种宗教捐不可能也没有给予西藏当局对达旺的任何领土主权。中国全权代表在1914年西姆拉会议上的发言也支持这一看法。1914年3月7日，陈贻范说：“支付给西藏人的不是通常所理解的税收，而仅仅是对寺院的捐款。与其说是税，不如说是慈善捐助。”1914年6月13日中国外交部长孙宝琦通知英国驻北京公使说，“西藏人自认为对凡有喇嘛教徒居住的所有地方都有权力，但事实并不是这样。喇嘛们可能有宗教上的权力，但这并不一定意味着这些地方属于西藏。”
    二十六、再者，某些西藏家族在传统边界以南有过私人房地产并且征收租金。这种租金不能认为是政府的税收。甚至在1914年以后还可能支付过这种租金，因为印度和西藏代表之间关于边界的协定保护了私人房地产权。
    二十七、中国政府引用了1853年英属印度当局同门巴族人签订的协定，并声称，根据这个协定，印度政府承认门巴族人属于西藏。如果真是这样的话，应该认为英属印度政府会直接同西藏签订这项协定。在那些年代里，西藏政府确是在独立进行谈判的，例如1856年它同尼泊尔签订的条约就是证明。事实上，1853年的协定是关于牵涉到一个西藏人的一件具体的事例，在这个特定的场合，当地的土王们似乎是在代表西藏政府行事。的确，九年以前，这些土王在1844年以书面的协定接受了英国在印度的权力。1844年协定的关键性的句子如下：“我们也保证执行从英国当局方面奉到的任何命令。”
    二十八、在下洛希特河谷（中国政府称为下察隅）的瓦弄地区，是由密内密人和西藏流民居住的四个村庄所组成。西藏流民的存在并不证明这个地区是属于西藏的。这些流民曾抵抗西藏当局收税的企图。
    二十九、说在印度和中国出版的权威性地图对这段边界的划法是符合现行的中国地图的划法，这是不正确的。正如前面已说过的，1917年出版的中华邮政舆图对边界的划法是同印度地图上的印度划法相符的。1925年11月北京大学出版了一幅地图，图上标明的中国边界是中国扩张得最多的时期，即1911年以前的清朝时候的边界。就是在那个时候，不丹以东的边界也是大致上沿着目前的划法。至于印度的官方地图，印度政府已经提起中国政府注意，印度测量局1895年出版的印度全图，这幅图用浅橘色标明了这个部落地区。从1938年到1952年，印度测量局用未标定界的记号画出了这条边界，因为事实上边界没有在地面上标定。但是，由于传统边界线是沿着一条主要的分水岭，印度政府在1954年决定，在地面上标界是不必要的。因此，以后的地图上就取消了未标定界的记号。
    三十、中国政府在这方面提到了尼赫鲁先生所著的“印度的发现”一书英文本第三版所附的1945年的印度一图。这幅具体的地图是出版商加进去的略图，作者不能对它的不准确性负责。也不应该由此得出任何对印度政府不利的结论。
    三十一、中国政府竟坚持对印度与西藏1914年关于确定不丹以东的传统边界的协定的法律效力提出疑问，印度政府对此感到遗憾。西藏运用自己的权利同外国进行谈判和缔结条约，这并不是第一次。在1914年以前，西藏曾有好几次同外国进行谈判和缔结条约。例如，西藏在1856年曾同尼泊尔缔结了一个条约，1904年又同英国缔结了一个条约。这些条约从未被中国反对过，而且都是充分有效的。在西姆拉会议上，西藏的全权代表和中国的全权代表是在平等的地位上开会。这个情况中国政府是明确而毫不含糊地同意了的。三个全权代表在1913年10月13日会议的第一次会上互换了全权证书。由达赖喇嘛发给的西藏代表的全权证书明确地说明了西藏在会议上是平等的一方，有权
  “决定有利于西藏的各种问题”，而西藏代表的全权证书中国代表是认为善妥的。英属印度代表的全权证书中国代表也是同意的，这份全权证书肯定了三个代表有平等地位，会议的召开就是“为了调整各个政府之间的关系”。
    三十二、认为印度和西藏在1914年3月缔结的关于印藏边界的协定是秘密的，这种说法是不正确的。这是双方有权威性的代表经过充分讨论后缔结、并且由西藏政府批准的协定。因此，这里面没有什么偷偷摸摸的。此外，印藏边界在三边条约的附图上是划定了的，而中国代表在1914年4月27日也在这个附图上签了名。1914年边界协定在1929年版的艾契生的“条约、契约、证书集”中发表过，再前一版是早在1909年发表的。中国政府从来没有对这个协定提出过抗议。事实上，早在这个协定以前，英属印度政府就建立了它对这些部落地区的权力，与各部落缔结了协定，并且创立了包括这整个地区的两个边区。这些事实都是众所周知的，而且西藏和中国政府都没有向英属印度当局提出过反对。
    三十三、中国政府说，在西姆拉会议上只讨论过中国和西藏之间以及外藏和内藏之间的界线，印度政府对此不能同意。认为中国代表签过字的条约图上的红线只代表西藏和中国其他部分之间的界线，从来没有说明过这条红线的一部分是中国和印度之间的分界线的说法，也是不对的。所谓条约附图上红线的麦克马洪线部分代表西藏和中国之间的边界，这种强辩是荒诞的。经英属印度，中国和西藏全权代表草签的条约的第九条就处理了西藏的边界问题，条约的附图又清楚地表明了西藏同印度的边界。这就是通称为麦克马洪线的边界线。中国政府1917年出版的中华邮政舆图把这条线划作印度和西藏之间的边界，并把线南地区标为印度。现在不论怎样夸大想像力，也不能够硬说那时在麦克马洪线以南还有中国的任何领土。关于红线代表西藏和中国之间的边界的说法，是同中国政府自己关于线南地区是由西藏当局而不是由中国政府行使管辖的说法相矛盾的。
    三十四、奇怪的是，中国政府现在竟想借助于1907年英俄条约，并且争论说1914年的条件是无效的，因为英国受1907年条约的约束不能同西藏直接进行谈判。中国不是英俄条约的当事者，不能引用那个条约来支持自己的论点。事实上，在整个谈判的过程中，谈判的进展一直被充分地通知了俄国政府。包括地图在内的一份条约被送给了俄国政府，而俄国政府对谈判和其后的条约都没有提出异议。
    三十五、中国的照会谈到中国政府1946—47年所提出的四次抗议。可以说明，这些抗议是对英属印度管理当局1943年在东北边境特区的一个小地方的行为而提出的。当时印度政府回答说，“印度政府在该地区所进行的唯一活动，完全限于在印藏边界的印度的一边，该边界被接受已有三十多年了”。国民党政府1949年11月的抗议，仅仅声明中国没有在西姆拉条约上签字。印度对这个抗议没有答复，因为不久之后，印度政府就在1949年12月承认了中华人民共和国。几个月后，印度政府在1950年8月致中国政府的照会中提到西藏和印度间被承认了的边界应该不受侵犯。同一年，印度总理公开宣布印度坚持麦克马洪线。因此，对于印度政府关于国际边界的立场，不能有任何怀疑。
    三十六、西藏人从没有对1914年议定的印藏边界提出过抗议。他们不止一次地承认这一边界线的存在，并且声称他们不想对它的有效性进行争论。当英属印度的代表在1936年和1938年口头上重申麦克马洪线的时候，西藏政府回答说，它完全知道1914年协定的条款。倒是印度政府在1943年对西藏人非法渗入印度领土提出了抗议。每当西藏人趁印度忙于其他事务而企图在印度领土内征收非法的税款时，印度政府就提出了同样的抗议。印度政府提出抗议，西藏人就撤退了。关于西藏人在1947年提出的荒唐的要求，尼赫鲁总理1959年9月26日的信中已经充分地予以处理。
    三十七、中国政府知道印度政府同不丹和锡金所有的特殊的条约关系。因此印度政府欢迎中国照会中对于锡金和不丹为一方和西藏为另一方之间的边界的解释。照会说，锡金和中国西藏地方之间的边界早经正式划定，在地图上既没有任何分歧，在实践中也没有任何争论。印度政府愿意补充说明，这条边界在地面上也已标定了。至于不丹，它的北部边界是传统的和众所周知的。东边和不丹接壤的是印度的东北边境特区，该地区和西藏之间的边界是传统的也是由协议所划定的。因此，不可能有任何西藏领土位于麦克马洪线以南。印度政府满意地注意到，中国政府没有对不丹北部任何部分重复它在地图上的要求。鉴于印度政府对保卫和保持不丹和锡金的完整负有责任，印度政府欢迎中国政府关于它不会侵犯锡金和不丹的领土的保证。
    三十八、以上各段已简略地阐述了有关中印边界问题的实质之点。中国政府竟重复它原先对朗久事件和羌臣摩河谷的空喀山口事件的说法，印度政府对此只能表示遗憾。有关这些事件的真相，已在印度的前几个照会中告知了中国政府。那些照会中所提出的各点迄今还没有得到回答。只须指出，如果中国人员真是在印度人员撤退后五天才进入朗久的话，印度人员的伤亡就无法解释，同样的，1959年11月24日交给中国驻德里大使馆的卡拉姆·辛格先生的详细叙述，驳倒了中国政府关于空喀山口事件的说法。印度政府不得不再次申明，如果中国部队没有侵入印度领土，对在印度领土上执行例行的巡逻任务的印度警察人员采取攻势的话，造成印度人员严重伤亡的这些不幸事件本来是不会发生的。
    三十九、印度政府对中国政府所表示的友情抱有同感。印度人民甚至在取得独立以前就大量表示了对中国人民的友谊。自从印度取得独立以来，这种友情有很多具体表现。因此，中国政府对印度的历史边界提出异议挑战使印度人民格外感到惊异和失望。最近的发展深深地扰乱了印度人民的心情，使他们对几世纪来一直保持平静的漫长边界产生了不安。因此，为了两国和世界和平的利益，必须采取积极步骤来消除引起目前紧张局势的原因和建立两国间友谊的坚实基础。
    四十、必须采取的第一个步骤，是由两国政府不迟延地协议一项安排，来完全消除产生边境冲突的危险并且便利对各项争端的友好解决。中国政府在最近的照会中重复了它原先的建议，即两国政府的武装力量从边界各撤二十公里或双方协议的其他距离，双方武装人员在边界全线停止巡逻。这些建议已在印度总理1959年11月16日给周恩来总理的信中详细讨论过了。印度总理在那封信里所提出的建设性的建议，就是旨在达到两国政府都希望达到的目的。印度政府仍然希望中国政府能接受这些建议。
    四十一、中国政府要求印度政府接受这样的立场，即“两国之间的整个边界从来没有划定过，因此，它还有待通过谈判来加以解决”，作为讨论的先决条件。印度政府显然不可能接受这种它认为是不合理并且违反历史、地理、习惯、传统和国际协定方面的事实的主张。以上各段所列举的事实完全驳倒了中国政府的论点。印度政府亟愿取得友好的解决，但是它决不能接受严重损害它的基本立场的建议。
    四十二、印度总理在1959年11月16日给周恩来总理的信中表示准备在适当的时间和地点同周总理会晤，但是他建议两国政府当前的努力应该集中来达成一项过渡性的谅解，这项谅解会有助于和缓目前的紧张局势和阻止局势恶化。虽然最近几星期来没有再发生边境事件，最主要的急务是达成一项过渡性的谅解。造成紧张和愤恨的基本原因依然存在。印度政府还没有能够明白，为什么几世纪以来一直保持平静的漫长边界在去年一年左右的时间内竟变成了紧张和不安的策源地。如果这方面有任何更深奥的原因的话，印度政府是不知道的。因此，除边界问题而外，为了中国和印度的利益以及一般地为了世界和平的利益，两国政府有必要不吝惜一切力量来消除误解和在坚固的基础上恢复两国之间的传统的友好诚挚的情谊。
