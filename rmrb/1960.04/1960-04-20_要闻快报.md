These employee technical training schools (classes) have all implemented the principle of "combining production, unified arrangement, teaching students according to their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity," and implemented a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies, such as simultaneously carrying out long-term training and short-term training, and organically combining technical education with the Four Modernizations. The forms of running schools (classes) are diverse, including district-run, industry-run, and factory-run, as well as technical research groups and technical lectures, old technician classes, young worker classes, leading cadre classes, and spare-time study, full-time and part-time study classes, and rotational training classes.
