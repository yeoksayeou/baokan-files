    The Yongyin Public Dining Hall of the All-People Production Team in Duyun City, Guizhou Province, is one of the Red Flag dining halls in Guizhou Province. Recently, we paid a visit here and encountered the following event.

    Yang Zhengying, an old lady who usually loves to talk and laugh with everyone, has been a little uneasy and absent-minded these past two days. Some commune members, seeing this, knew she had something on her mind. The women's team leader, Li Shiying, accompanied the old lady home from the dining hall after dinner that day. On the way, the old lady finally revealed her "concerns" completely.

    It turned out that Yang Da's second son, Tang Yingju, had decided to marry a girl from another village on March 10th of this year back in April of last year. With the date drawing closer and closer, and now that everyone eats in the dining hall, how could they manage to entertain so many guests at home?

    "This is truly a great happy event!" Li Shiying said happily after listening.

    "That's why I was planning to buy two chickens and get some wine to just treat my in-laws to a meal when my daughter-in-law enters the door; otherwise, I wouldn't be worrying about this."

    "Oh, why didn't you give us a heads-up earlier, Auntie? The dining hall has long had regulations for such happy events. You don't have to worry; just leave everything to the dining hall."

    "Really?" The old lady said in surprise, "Why didn't the dining hall help Luo Shineng when he received his bride the year before last?"

    "That's last year's almanac. The dining hall we ran the year before last wasn't this kind of dining hall. Back then, it was a temporary cooking group run by the agricultural cooperative," Li Shiying explained while smiling.

    "It's just for my family's affairs, causing such a commotion in the dining hall; how can that be good?"

    "Now that everyone fills their pots with the same rice and eats from the same pot of vegetables, we've all become one family. Why say such things?" Shiying said as she stopped walking. "Auntie, you go ahead; I'll go back and tell the team about this so they can arrange it quickly."

    The night before Yang Da's son married his wife, dining hall accountant Tang Shiqing and several cooks were figuring out what dishes to make for the bride's arrival and how to receive the guests when Luo Fuming, an old man, rushed in, saying, "Shiqing, my son Qianren's wedding has also been set for tomorrow. What do you think we should do?"

    "Wasn't your son Qianren's wedding scheduled for September?" Shiqing was caught off guard.

    "Originally, we were planning to wait until after the autumn harvest, when we'd have more money on hand, but after hearing about Yang Da's family's affair yesterday, I talked to my in-laws this morning, and they all said it's better to get it done sooner rather than later, so the date was moved forward. I already spoke with the team leader about this, but it will just add some trouble to the dining hall." After hearing Luo Fuming's explanation, Shiqing said, "It won't add any trouble; we'll just make a little more rice and vegetables tomorrow."

    That night, to prepare for the two families' weddings, Shiqing barely slept. He first successively filled out several "Guest Grain Ration Registration Forms" and several "Guest Gift Money Registration Forms." Later, he thought: For weddings, each family should be sent a pair of couplets. So, he found red paper and a writing brush, and after pondering for half a day, he wrote two couplets in one breath. One was: "The commune's flowers bloom as the newlyweds arrive, singing a song of happiness with one heart." The other was: "The commune dining hall hosts happy events, never forgetting our benefactor, Chairman Mao."

    To see more details about how the commune dining hall hosts happy events, we got up relatively early the next day. That day, the commune members still went to work as usual. We walked to the entrance of the dining hall and looked up to see a notice posted: "Comrade Commune Members: Today is the day that Yang Zhengying and Luo Fuming's families receive their brides. According to the production team's decision, the dining hall's date for improving living standards this month will be changed from the originally scheduled 15th to today. The banquet will start at 5:30 PM, and the club will perform a flower lantern opera in the evening...."

    Before long, we heard that the two newlyweds had entered the village and would soon arrive at the dining hall. We got up and ran outside the dining hall. Because we knew that according to the past habits of the local Buyi people, whenever newlyweds enter the house, outsiders must temporarily avoid them; otherwise, the newlyweds would "offend life" and not be able to have children in the future. Who knew that Yang Da had quick eyes and grabbed us, saying, "Comrades, we no longer believe in that old superstition. Let's sit down and drink tea!" Luo Fuming also came over to persuade us, and we felt relieved and sat down again.

    The wedding ceremony was originally arranged to be held separately at Yang Da's and Luo Da's homes. However, both old men disagreed. Auntie said, "Besides the dining hall, where else can we find a home that is so thoughtful in everything it does?" So, the wedding ceremony was held in the dining hall's dining room. When it was time for the banquet in the afternoon, we looked around and saw that in addition to the original thirty-two tables for the team, six tables had been set up for the guests, and each table had an extra plate of fried food, according to the dining hall's standard for improving living standards on the first and fifteenth of the month. All of this made Auntie feel satisfied, and she led her son and the bride in offering a glass of wine at each table in order. When she walked to our table, Auntie said with a smile, "Comrades, you must drink a few more cups."

### 公共食堂的婚礼

    公共食堂的婚礼
    叶庆农
    贵州都匀市全民生产队壅引食堂，是贵州省的红旗食堂之一。最近，我们到这里作了一次访问，遇到了这样一件事情。
    平时逢人就爱说爱笑的杨正英大妈，这两天却愰愰惚惚地有点不安。有些社员见了这个情景，知道她心里有事。妇女队长李时英，这天吃罢晚饭，就陪着大妈从食堂走回家去，在路上，大妈终于把自己的“心事”全盘端了出来。
    原来杨大妈的第二个儿子唐应举早在去年4月间就跟外寨的一位姑娘决定今年3月10日结婚。眼看离这个日期越来越近，如今都在食堂吃饭，家里要请这样多的客人怎能办到呢？
    “这真是一件大喜事啊！”李时英听了高兴地说。
    “就是为了这，我才打算买两只鸡，打点酒，等媳妇过门时，将就请亲家母吃一顿；要不然我也就不操这份心了。”
    “嗳，大妈怎不早透个信呢，像这样的喜事，食堂早就有规定的，你老人家不用操心，都交给食堂办好了。”
    “当真？”大妈惊奇地说：“咋个前年罗世能接亲，食堂没有帮他的忙呢？”
    “那是那年的皇历，前年我们办的不是这号食堂，那阵子是农业社办的临时煮饭组。”李时英边解释边笑。
    “为我一家的事，在食堂里劳师动众，咋个好呢？”
    “如今大伙同甑装饭，同锅吃菜，都成了一家人，还用说这些话。”时英边说边停下脚步。“大妈先走一步，我回去把这事告诉队里，好让他们赶紧安排。”
    杨大妈娶媳妇的头天晚上，食堂会计唐世清和几个炊事员正在盘算接亲时做哪些饭菜、怎样接待客人的时候，罗福明大爹匆匆忙忙地跑了进来：“世清，我家钱仁的婚事，也选定了明天的日期，你看咋办？”
    “你家钱仁的婚事，不是订在9月间才办吗？”世清感到很突然。
    “原先打算等秋后，手边活动些再办，昨天听到杨大妈家的事，今早起我就到亲家母那里一谈，他们都说早办早了一桩心事，所以日子就提前了。这事刚才跟队长说过，只是要给食堂增加一些麻烦了。”世清听了福明大爹这番解释，便说：“增加不了麻烦，明天顺便多做点饭和菜就行了。”
    这天晚上，为了筹办两家的亲事，世清几乎一夜没有合眼。他先接连划了几张“客人交粮票登记表”和几张“客人交贺金登记表”，后来又想到：办喜事，应当一家送他们一副对联。于是找来红纸和毛笔，经过半天捉摸，一口气写出了两副对联。一副是：“公社花开新人到，同心合唱幸福歌”。另一副是：“公社食堂办喜事，不忘恩人毛主席”。
    公社食堂怎样办喜事，为了再看详细些，第二天我们起得比较早，这天社员们还是照常出工做活路。我们走到饭厅门口，抬头就看见食堂贴出的一张通知：“社员同志们：今天是杨正英、罗福明两家接亲的日子，按生产队的决定，本月食堂改善生活的日期，由原订十五日改到今天，开席时下午五点半，晚上俱乐部演唱花灯剧……。”
    不一会工夫，听说两位新人已进了寨子马上就要来到饭厅时，我们起身就往饭厅外面跑。因为我们知道，按照当地布依族农民过去的习惯，凡是新人进屋的这一刻工夫，外族人都得暂时避开一下，不然新人“犯生”，以后不会生育。谁知杨大妈眼快，一把抓住我们：“同志，那一套老迷信，我们早就不信了，还是坐下来吃茶吧！”罗福明大爹也过来这样劝解，我们才放心重新坐了下来。
    婚礼的仪式，原安排在杨大妈和罗大爹家里分头举行的。可是两位老人都不同意，大妈说：“除了食堂，还往哪里找得出这样事事办得周到的家。”于是婚礼的仪式就放在食堂的饭厅里举行了。到了下午开席的时候，我们举目一看：除了队里原来吃饭的三十二桌人外，还给客人开了六桌，每桌按照食堂初一和十五改善生活的标准，又格外增添了一个油煎盘子。所有这一些，使大妈都感到满意，她带领着儿子和新娘每桌按序敬一杯酒。走到我们桌子跟前时，大妈笑着说：“同志，你们要多喝两杯呀。”
