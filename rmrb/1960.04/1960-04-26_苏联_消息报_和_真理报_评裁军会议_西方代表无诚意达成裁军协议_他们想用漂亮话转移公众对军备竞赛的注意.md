Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th - The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an observer's commentary today on the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference. The commentary said that the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference has been going on for a month and a half, and this length of time is enough to reach an agreement on a plan for complete and thorough disarmament, but no such agreement has been reached so far.

The commentary said that, not only that, but a situation has developed within the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee in which the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have extended a hand of cooperation to the West more than once, but to no avail.

The commentary said that the West has not put forward a single constructive proposal. The representatives of Western countries have been trying to get the meeting to discuss their proposals, but this is only to collect more military intelligence from socialist countries, and to use espionage to replace disarmament. This is the path taken by certain groups in the West. They want to use their "disarmament plans" to obtain things that their own military plans cannot. The commentary pointed out that Herter himself admitted this, calling the Western "disarmament plan" an American "security plan" and using it as the most favorable supplement to the arms race.

The commentary pointed out that, however, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are still continuing to seek ways to meet each other at the disarmament conference. How do Western countries treat these attempts? One gets the impression that Western diplomats came to Geneva not to conduct disarmament negotiations, but to obstruct disarmament. This situation is by no means accidental. It turns out that the authors of the Western "disarmament plan" are also the authors of the plan to arm the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with nuclear weapons. The statement made by Norstad, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, two days before the start of the Geneva Conference, fully proves this point.

The commentary said, so why did the representatives of Western countries come to Geneva? Many commentators have pointed out that the representatives of Western countries came to Geneva not to reach a disarmament agreement, but to create illusions, to deceive the public with illusions, and to divert their attention from the arms race.

"Pravda" today published a dispatch from Geneva, criticizing the nine-point plan against disarmament put forward by the United States at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference.

The dispatch pointed out that this plan and the speech by Eaton, the American representative attending the disarmament conference, fully prove that the West has departed from the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on disarmament. The American representative and the representatives of Western countries have tried every possible means to refuse to implement this resolution. The many fine words they say are only to deceive world opinion. (Attached picture)

Newspaper message: The "disarmament" plan proposed by Western countries at the East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference does not mention any deadline for implementation.
  -- When will the United States destroy these weapons?
  -- They will be destroyed when they are launched.

    苏联“消息报”和“真理报”评裁军会议
    西方代表无诚意达成裁军协议
    他们想用漂亮话转移公众对军备竞赛的注意
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联“消息报”今天就十国裁军会议发表一篇观察家评论。评论说，十国裁军会议已经进行了一个半月了，这样长的时间足以就全面彻底裁军计划达成协议，但是，目前并没有达成这样的协议。
    评论说，不但如此，十国裁军委员会内形成了这样一种情况：苏联和其他社会主义国家不止一次向西方伸出合作的手，但都落空了。
    评论说，西方没有提出过一个建设性的建议。西方国家代表一直企图使会议讨论他们提出的方案，这只是为了更多的搜集社会主义国家的军事情报，用间谍活动来代替裁军，这就是西方某些集团所走的道路。他们想借助于自己的“裁军计划”来得到本国军事计划所得不到的东西。评论指出，赫脱自己也承认这点，他把西方的“裁军计划”称为美国“安全计划”，并将它作为军备竞赛的最有利的补充。
    评论指出，但是，苏联和其它社会主义国家在裁军会议上仍然继续寻求双方接近的道路，而西方国家怎样对待这些尝试呢？有这样的印象：西方外交家们到日内瓦来不是为了进行裁军谈判，而是为了阻挠裁军。这种情况绝不是偶然的。原来西方“裁军计划”的作者也就是以核武器武装北大西洋公约组织各国的计划的作者。北大西洋公约组织驻欧洲武装部队总司令诺斯塔德在日内瓦会议开始前两天所作的声明，完全证明了这点。
    评论说，那么西方国家代表又为甚么要到日内瓦来呢？许多评论家指出，西方国家代表到日内瓦来不是为了达成裁军协议而是为了制造幻想，用幻想来欺骗公众和转移他们对军备竞赛的注意。
    “真理报”今天刊登了一篇发自日内瓦的通讯，抨击美国在十国裁军会议上提出的反对裁军的九点方案。
    通讯指出，这个方案和出席裁军会议的美国代表伊顿的讲话完全证明西方离开了联合国大会关于裁军问题的决议。美国代表和西方国家代表千方百计地拒绝执行这一决议。他们所说的许多漂亮言词只是为了欺骗世界舆论。（附图片）
    报纸消息：西方国家在东西方十国裁军会议上提出的“裁军”方案根本没有提到任何执行的期限
  ——美国准备什么时候销毁这些武器？
  ——等到发射出去，就销毁了。
