Animal Husbandry Must Develop at High Speed

Currently, a new high tide of animal husbandry production, centered on pig raising, is sweeping the country. This high tide is unprecedented in its momentum, scale, speed of development, and remarkable results. The number of pigs raised nationwide is soaring, the breeding work of large livestock started early with good quality, and the lambing survival rate of sheep in spring is high, all of which fully demonstrate that the current situation is excellent. However, we must also see that, from a national perspective, development is not balanced between regions and between breeds, with varying speeds. Therefore, further study of the experiences of various regions in developing animal husbandry at high speed is extremely necessary.

Today, this newspaper publishes news of the great development and full improvement of animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province and the great harvest of lambs in Qinghai Province, which are two typical examples of high-speed development of animal husbandry. Heilongjiang's experience powerfully illustrates the dialectical relationship between quantity and quality, proving that large-scale development and full improvement are two inseparable aspects of high-speed development of animal husbandry. In 1959, the province's pigs increased by 65% compared to 1958, large livestock increased by 8.1%, and poultry doubled. All pigs are selected local breeds such as the Dahei pig and Berkshire crossbreeds. Good breeds of horses with great pulling power and fast walking speed have accounted for 15% of the total herd. Improved cattle with large size, weight, and high milk production have accounted for 30% of the total herd. Fine-wool and semi-fine-wool sheep for both wool and meat have accounted for more than 60% of the total herd. Improved breeds of chickens are found everywhere. This has led animal husbandry production into a new era of high-speed, large-scale development and full improvement. The experience of Qinghai Province once again proves that improving feeding and management is a very important key to the high-speed development of animal husbandry.

Large-scale development and full improvement is the general direction for developing animal husbandry at high speed with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Heilongjiang Province's experience is that to achieve large-scale development and full improvement, we should first adopt the method of the state, communes, institutions, and enterprises running large-scale livestock farms to initially form a base network. With a base, it is easier to implement specialized management, which opens up broad avenues for realizing scientific management, accelerating reproduction, improving breeds, controlling and eliminating animal diseases, and moving towards mechanized and semi-mechanized feeding; it also more effectively implements the principle of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, raising the status of animal husbandry from a past subsidiary position to one as important as crop cultivation. Since the province established a large number of animal husbandry production bases, the development speed of animal husbandry has significantly improved, and many advanced units of large-scale development and full improvement of animal husbandry have emerged. At the end of 1959, the number of large and small sows in the province increased by 60% compared to the same period in 1958, and the number of large livestock females also increased by about 15% compared to 1958, and sufficient improved breeding boars were selected and retained. Thus, there was a breeding foundation and the initiative for large-scale development was grasped, enabling full breeding of female animals with a pregnancy rate of over 70%. Anda County emerged with sows producing hundreds of piglets a year and ewes producing eight lambs a year, and a mare conception rate of 90%. Baiquan County emerged with pig raising doubling and one pig per person, and Zhaodong County emerged with 15% of ewes producing twins. At the same time, because livestock farms can more reasonably allocate excellent breeding boars and establish artificial insemination networks, and vigorously carry out artificial insemination, it is more powerfully promoted the large-scale improvement of livestock breeds. On average, each people's commune in Heilongjiang Province has six to seven artificial insemination stations and insemination points, and the province has more than 10,000 people who can master artificial insemination techniques. Artificial insemination can fully exert the breeding efficiency of excellent breeding boars, achieving multiple mating of one boar and multiple breeding of one dam, making it possible to select the best from the best and refine the best, accelerating the speed of improvement.

In the high-speed development of animal husbandry, both Qinghai Province and Heilongjiang Province have vigorously improved feeding management, which is a very important factor in the great development of animal husbandry in these two provinces. Among them, the experience of Qinghai Province deserves special attention. The vast number of herdsmen and state-owned farm workers in Qinghai Province, based on the new situation after communization, more reasonably divided pastures and herds, so that each flock of sheep had its own pasture and each pasture could play a greater role, and implemented the advanced grazing method of dividing into seasons and zones, so that 95% of the sheep reached the first-class fatness. This laid the foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. Because they tried every means to solve the feed problem, controlled the main diseases of livestock, and improved feeding management, they achieved a new situation of raising more, living more, raising well, and raising strongly in breeding and improvement work. At present, many places across the country have also made great achievements in these aspects and provided rich experience, which should be carefully summarized and effectively promoted.

The occurrence and development of any new thing cannot be smooth sailing, but the experience since the Great Leap Forward has proven that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and launch mass movements on a large scale, we will move mountains and overturn seas, overcome all difficulties, and be invincible. The great development and full improvement of animal husbandry in Heilongjiang was achieved in the process of struggle between two methods and two paths. When the Provincial Party Committee proposed the policy of "large-scale development and full improvement," some cadres and masses showed a single-minded idea of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry, saying that "agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be carried out simultaneously, and the high-speed development of animal husbandry will inevitably affect the development of agriculture." Some people believed that "emphasizing both more and better at the same time will delay both," and the well-to-do middle peasants also came out and said, "The collective's large-scale is not as good as the scattered small-scale." Although these right-leaning sentiments were ideological reflections of a minority of people, if they were not resolved, they would become obstacles in the way forward. Party organizations at all levels in Heilongjiang Province extensively mobilized the masses to carry out discussions and debates, thoroughly criticized the ideas of small producers and well-to-do middle peasants, clarified the interdependent and mutually promoting role of agriculture and animal husbandry, and further strengthened leadership, established corresponding institutions, and transferred a large number of outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to the animal husbandry front, setting off a new upsurge of the whole Party working together, the whole people mobilizing, and vigorously engaging in animal husbandry production, thereby pushing animal husbandry production to a new stage of large-scale development and full improvement.

At present, the situation of developing animal husbandry across the country is very good, and the high tide of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising is rolling forward. In the process of high-speed development, various livestock and poultry are not only making rapid progress in quantity, but also rapidly improving in quality. Many typical experiences tell us that the policy of focusing on developing quantity and supplementing with improving quality, and emphasizing both quantity and quality, is an inevitable trend and objective law in the high-speed development of animal husbandry, and it is also the urgent demand of the broad masses of people. We should guide the situation, boost our energy, and push China's animal husbandry production to a greater high tide.

    畜牧业必须高速度发展
    目前，一个以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产新高潮正席卷全国。这个高潮声势之大，规模之广，发展之快，效果之显著是前所未有的。全国养猪头数飞跃直上，大家畜配种工作开配早、质量好，羊的春胎下羔成活率高，这都充分说明当前形势极好。但是我们还必须看到：就全国的情况来说，地区和地区之间、品种和品种之间，发展还不够平衡，有快有慢，因此进一步研究各地高速度发展畜牧业的经验，极为必要。
    今天本报发表的黑龙江省畜牧业大发展全改良和青海省羊羔大丰收的消息是高速度发展畜牧业的两个典型。黑龙江的经验有力地说明了数量和质量的辩证关系，证明大发展全改良是高速度发展畜牧业不可分割的两个方面。该省1959年比1958年猪增加65％，大家畜增长8.1％，家禽增长一倍。猪全是选用的当地大黑猪、巴克夏杂种等良种。挽力大、运步快的良种马已占全群15％。个大、体重、产奶多的改良牛，已占全群的30％。毛肉兼用的细毛、半细毛羊已占全群60％以上。良种鸡遍及各地。使畜牧业生产进入到高速度大发展全改良的新时期。青海省的经验则再一次证明，改善饲养管理，是高速度发展畜牧业一个十分重要的关键。
    大发展全改良是多快好省地高速度发展畜牧业的总方向。黑龙江省的经验是：要实现大发展全改良，首先应该采取国家、公社、机关、企业大办畜牧场的办法，初步形成基地网。有了基地就便于实行专业经营，就为实现科学管理，加速繁殖，改良品种，控制与消灭兽疫和走向饲养机械化、半机械化开辟了广阔的道路；就更有效地贯彻了农牧并举的方针，把畜牧业由过去的副业地位提到与种植业同等重要的地位。该省自从大量建立起畜牧业生产基地以后，畜牧业的发展速度有了显著的提高，并出现了很多畜牧业大发展全改良的先进单位。1959年末该省大小母猪数量比1958年同期增长60％，大家畜母畜也比1958年增长15％左右，并选留了足够的良种公畜，这样就有了繁殖基础，掌握了大发展的主动权，使母畜全配，怀胎率达70％以上。并出现了年繁百仔的母猪、年繁八仔的母羊、母马受胎率达90％的安达县，出现了养猪翻一番、一人一猪的拜泉县，还出现了15％的母羊双产双羔的肇东县。同时，由于畜牧场能够更合理地调配优良种公畜，建立人工授精网点，大搞人工授精，因而更有力地促进牲畜品种大改良。黑龙江省平均每个人民公社就有人工授精站和输精点六到七处之多，全省能够掌握人工授精技术的人员达一万余人。人工授精能充分发挥优良种公畜的配种效能，达到一种多配一母多繁，这样就有可能做到优中选优，精中选精，加快改良速度。
    青海省和黑龙江省在高速度发展畜牧业中，都大力改善了饲养管理，这是这两个省的畜牧业获得大发展的一个很重要的因素。其中，青海省的经验值得特别重视。青海省广大牧民和国营牧场职工，根据公社化以后的新情况，更合理地划分牧场和畜群，使群群羊只有牧场，使个个牧场都能发挥更大作用，并且实行了分季划片的先进牧放方法，因而使95％的羊群达到了一类膘。这就为高速度发展畜牧业打下了基础。由于他们千方百计地解决了饲料问题，控制了牲畜主要疫病，改善了饲养管理，使繁殖和改良工作实现了养的多、活的多、养的好、养的壮新形势。目前全国许多地方也在这些方面作出了很大的成绩，提供了丰富的经验，应该认真地进行总结，切实推广。
    任何新事物的发生和发展都不可能是一帆风顺的，但是大跃进以来的经验证明：任何工作只要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，就会移山倒海，攻无不克，战无不胜。黑龙江畜牧业大发展全改良就是在两种方法和两条道路的斗争的过程中取得胜利的。当省委提出“大发展、全改良”的方针时，有的干部和群众表现了重农轻牧的单打一思想，说“农、牧不能并举，畜牧业高速度发展，势必影响农业的发展”，有人认为：“多和好同时强调，就会两耽误”，富裕中农也出来说：“集体的大帮的搞不好，分散的小帮的优越”。这些右倾情绪，虽然是少数人的思想反映，但如果不去解决就会成为前进中的障碍。黑龙江省各级党组织广泛地发动群众开展鸣放辩论，彻底地批判了小生产者和富裕中农思想，明确了农牧业相互依存、相互促进的作用，同时进一步加强了领导，建立了相应的机构，并把大批优秀共产党员和共青团员输送到畜牧战线上去，掀起了全党动手，全民动员，大搞畜牧业生产的新高潮，从而把畜牧业生产推向了大发展全改良的新阶段。
    目前全国发展畜牧业的形势十分良好，各地以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产高潮正滚滚向前。在高速度发展过程中各种牲畜、家禽不仅在数量上突飞猛进，质量上也有迅速提高。许多典型经验都告诉我们，以发展数量为主，提高质量为辅，数量和质量并举的方针是高速度发展畜牧业中的必然趋势和客观发展的规律，也是广大人民群众的迫切要求。我们应当因势利导，鼓足干劲，把我国的畜牧业生产推向更大的高潮。
