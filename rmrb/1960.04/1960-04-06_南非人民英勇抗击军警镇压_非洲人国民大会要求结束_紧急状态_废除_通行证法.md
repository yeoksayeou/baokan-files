Xinhua News Agency, April 5th, Durban Dispatch: The South African authorities' bloody suppression and mass arrests of Africans have aroused increasingly strong resistance, and more and more South African people are joining the just struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights.

    In Welkom, a gold mining city in the Orange Free State in the South African interior, a group of African miners held a demonstration on a nearby highway on the 4th. They resolutely refused to disperse and fought with the police who came to suppress them. Twelve workers were bravely injured. On the same day, in Klaremont in the Durban area, about six thousand African demonstrators clashed with the police. The police wielded batons to attack the demonstrators, one demonstrator was beaten to death, nine were injured, and another nine were arrested.

    According to reports, in Nyanga, one of the first African townships to erupt in demonstrations, a group of Africans gathered on a local hilltop on the 4th to resist police suppression. The police used armored vehicles and opened fire on the Africans, killing two and wounding three.

    In addition, demonstrations by Africans are still occurring in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and Johannesburg.

    The strike struggle of African workers continued on the 4th in various parts of South Africa. In Smithtown, eight miles south of Durban, none of the five thousand African workers went to work that day. In Lamontville, another town near Durban, two thousand workers also refused to work. The strike held by African workers in Cato Manor is still ongoing. In Clairwood, forty miles from Durban, striking workers launched a propaganda campaign to the masses late on the night of the 4th.

    The African National Congress of South Africa, despite the current bans and persecution of its members, issued a statement on the 4th again calling on Africans to fight for the abolition of the "Pass Laws" and the establishment of a democratic system in South Africa. The statement demands: (1) The "state of emergency" must be ended, the arrested leaders must be released, and freedom of speech and organization must be established; (2) The "Pass Laws" restricting and controlling the movement of Africans must be abolished; (3) African wages must be increased, with a minimum daily wage of one pound; (4) Laws enacted by the past authorities, including the "Public Safety Act," the "Suppression of Communism Act," and similar bills must be repealed; (5) A new national congress representing all the people on a fully democratic basis must be convened to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new federation, a non-racial democratic system belonging to all African people, in line with the United Nations Charter and the views of enlightened people around the world.

    The chairman of the Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa, Sobukwe, and twenty-two other Africans refused to plead guilty to the alleged "crimes" in court on the 4th. Sobukwe said on behalf of all the defendants in court, "We believe that the charges against us are based on a law entirely formulated for white people, and the officials enforcing this law are also white. We see no way that justice can be administered under these circumstances." The news said that during the trial, the court had to be temporarily adjourned because some Africans tried to attend the hearing.

    According to reports, the South African authorities, blatantly disregarding the condemnation of the people of the world, are still dispatching large numbers of military police to carry out bloody suppression against Africans. The atrocity of forcing Africans to work by armed force is happening almost all over the country. On the 4th, the largest series of arrests in two weeks began in the Cape Town area. Colonial military police carried out house-to-house searches of African townships, and all bridges, docks, highways and other important strongholds were filled with sentries. The city was filled with troops carrying submachine guns, and command posts directed by radio were set up everywhere. Military patrols carrying hand-held machine guns patrolled around the Cape Town Parliament Building, and armed men beat blacks on the streets with rubber whips. An African nurse revealed that "the military police are beating every (African) person. We are trying our best to help the injured, but we have run out of bandages. There is blood everywhere." According to the South African Ministry of Defense Liaison Officer Reyneke, "Cape Town is currently virtually under military occupation."

    南非人民英勇抗击军警镇压
    非洲人国民大会要求结束“紧急状态”废除“通行证法”
    新华社5日讯　德班消息：南非当局对非洲人的血腥镇压和大规模逮捕激起了愈来愈强烈的反抗，更多的南非人民投入了反对种族歧视和争取基本人权的正义斗争。
    在南非内地奥兰治自由邦的金矿城市维尔科姆，一批非洲矿工4日在附近的公路上举行了示威集会。他们坚决拒绝解散，同赶来镇压的警察展开了斗争，有十二名工人英勇受伤。同一天，在德班地区的克拉里门，约六千名非洲示威者同警察发生冲突，警察挥舞警棍向示威者进行冲击，有一名示威者被打死，九名被打伤，另有九名被捕。
    据报道，在最早爆发示威的非洲人市镇之一的尼安加，一群非洲人4日聚集在当地一座小山顶上抗击警察的镇压。警察使用了装甲车，又向非洲人开了枪，有两人被打死，三人被打伤。
    另外，在伊丽莎白港、开普敦和约翰内斯堡等地，非洲人的示威活动仍在不断发生。
    在南非各地，非洲工人的罢工斗争4日也在继续中。在德班以南八英里的史密斯市镇，五千名非洲工人这天一个也没有去上工。在德班附近另一个市镇拉蒙特维尔，也有二千名工人拒绝上工。卡托马诺尔非洲工人举行的罢工还在坚持中。在距离德班四十英里的克拉尔蒙特，罢工工人4日深夜还向群众展开了宣传活动。
    南非非洲人国民大会不顾当前的禁令和对它的成员的迫害，4日发表声明再次号召非洲人为废除“通行证法”和在南非建立民主制度而斗争。声明要求：（一）必须结束“紧急状态”，释放被捕的领袖，建立言论和组织自由；（二）必须废除限制和控制非洲人行动的“通行证法”；（三）提高非洲人的工资，规定每天最低一英镑的工资；（四）必须废除过去当局制定的法律，包括“公共安全法”、“镇压共产主义法”，以及类似的法案；（五）必须召开在完全民主的基础上代表全体人民的新的全国代表大会，为建立一个新联邦、一个属于全体非洲人民、符合联合国宪章以及全世界各地开明人士的观点的非种族民主制度奠定基础。
    南非泛非主义者大会主席索布克韦和另外二十二个非洲人4日在法庭上拒绝就被控“罪名”进行答辩。索布克韦代表全体被告在法庭上说，“我们认为，对我们的控告是根据一个完全是为白人制定的法律，执行这个法律的官员也都是白人。我们看不出在这种情况下如何能主持公道”。消息说，在审讯的当时，由于有些非洲人试图旁听，法庭曾一度不得不暂时休庭。
    据报道，南非当局悍然不顾全世界人民的谴责，仍在出动大批军警向非洲人进行血腥的镇压。武装强迫非洲人上工的暴行差不多在全国各地都发生着。4日，在开普敦地区开始了两周以来规模最大的一系列逮捕。殖民军警对非洲人市镇进行了挨户搜捕，一切桥梁、码头、公路等重要据点都布满了岗哨。城内各地都有携带着冲锋枪的军队，到处都设有以无线电指挥的据点。军事巡逻队携带着手提机关枪在开普敦议会大厦四周巡逻，武装人员在街上用橡皮鞭抽打黑人。一位非洲护士揭露说，“军警殴打每一个（非洲）人，我们正尽力帮助受伤的人，但是我们的绷带已经用完了。到处都是鲜血。”据南非国防部联络官雷纳克透露，“开普敦目前实际上已处于军事占领之下”。
