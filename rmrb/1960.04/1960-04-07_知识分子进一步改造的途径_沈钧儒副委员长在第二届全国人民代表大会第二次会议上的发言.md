Comrades Deputies and Members,

    I listened with great excitement to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget." These two reports comprehensively and deeply reflected the great achievements our people have made under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao over the past year, and demonstrated the magnificent situation of our socialist construction in the first year of the 1960s. After two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward since 1958, our people have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Our economic, political, and social outlook has undergone unprecedented changes. This is a glorious poem written by 650 million hardworking and brave people in the history of our socialist construction. It makes the imperialists panic, and makes the oppressed people all over the world rejoice and cheer for the great victory of our country!

    The Situation is Getting Better and Better

    Our 1960 National Economic Plan is another great plan for continued leap forward, a plan for both high speed and proportionate development. Now it seems that the situation is getting better and better. First of all, under the three victorious red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we have accumulated relatively rich experience. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, a brand new situation of a good start, complete success, monthly red, and daily red has emerged. Recently, our country has launched a nationwide mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution to increase production and practice economy. This movement is surging forward and sweeping the country. The productive forces are developing rapidly at a rate of thousands of miles a day. At the same time, the soundly developing rural people's communes are striving for an all-round leap forward in agriculture, and cities across the country are also vigorously running people's communes. The growth of urban people's communes is a new and major positive factor for us to realize the 1960 and future continued leap forward. With these new favorable factors, we are deeply convinced that the 1960 National Economic Plan can not only be completed, but will also be overfulfilled. We will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in less time than ten years, and achieve the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule, and turn our country into a socialist country with a highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at an earlier date.

    Faced with such a good situation, we intellectuals feel infinitely happy and encouraged. Each of us is proud to live in the great Mao Zedong era. In the past few years, we intellectuals have made great progress under the cultivation and education of the Party and Chairman Mao. Especially in the past two years, under the glorious illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and driven by the working masses, we have made greater contributions in active service, and have also made great improvements in our political ideology. Many people have actively participated in labor practice, tempered themselves in labor, and taken a big step towards the laborization of intellectuals; some people have actively plunged into the technical revolution, the cultural revolution, and the educational revolution, and have made achievements in teaching, scientific research, and production and construction. Some older intellectuals and experts have also begun to learn to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois science. These significant advances should be affirmed.

    Of course, these advances of intellectuals are far from enough when compared with the current situation of the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the leaping development of socialist construction. Our subjective world is far behind the objective world. For example, some people, seeing the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, not only do not want to catch up, but even feel nervous, and have the idea of "taking a break." A few people even have negative emotions and a sense of inferiority in the face of the great situation. For example, some people are still nostalgic for the old way of life and work, and are not very accustomed to collective life. When the masses are engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, some people are still accustomed to closing the door and working alone, and do not believe that scientific research and cultural and educational work can follow the mass line. In my opinion, all these are still due to the fact that the bourgeois stand and world outlook have not been fundamentally transformed. Therefore, intellectuals must continue to move forward on the basis of the progress they have already made, and further thoroughly transform their stand and world outlook, in order to make their subjective world adapt to the requirements of the objective world. The current situation is very favorable to the ideological remolding of our intellectuals. The continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production in our country has promoted the continuous revolution of thought, and the continuous revolution of thought has in turn affected and accelerated the leap forward of production. The transformation of our intellectuals is also accelerating along with the continuous deepening of the leap forward of production and the revolution of thought, which is completely in line with objective laws.

    Actively Participate in Practice

    The way for intellectuals to further transform themselves should be to participate in labor practice that serves socialism on the one hand, and to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist political theory on the other hand. These are the two aspects that we must strive for in self-transformation, and we must carry them out closely so that the two can promote each other. This is the method of walking on two legs. First of all, we must participate in practice more actively. There are three aspects to practice:

    First, through participating in physical labor, learning from workers and peasants in labor, and gradually cultivating the thoughts and feelings of the working people, which can not only temper our stand, but also transform our thinking and cultivate our feelings for the working people.

    Second, professional practice, doing our job well. Most of us intellectuals are cultural and educational workers, and many are scientific and technical personnel. Currently, our country is launching a vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. This movement has a far-reaching significance for the continued leap forward of our socialist construction, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun has explained very clearly in his report. I believe that our intellectuals will definitely throw themselves into this great movement with great excitement and initiative, resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the broad masses of workers and peasants, carry forward the communist style of combining daring to think and act with a scientific attitude, break superstitions, work hard and skillfully, and contribute our skills and ideas in every possible way to make our contributions in technical innovation and technical revolution. This kind of professional practice is not only conducive to the cause of socialist construction, but we can also learn from the workers and peasants in the movement, their soaring enthusiasm, their communist style of not fearing difficulties, leaving the difficulties to themselves, and leaving the convenience to others. On the cultural and educational front, our country is also launching a high tide of cultural revolution and educational revolution, to popularize culture and education at high speed, to improve the quality of culture and education, and to cultivate a strong contingent of scientific and technical personnel and a theoretical contingent of Marxism-Leninism as soon as possible, to better cooperate with and promote the Great Leap Forward in production, and to serve our economic base. In this regard, there are more things that we intellectuals can do. In professional practice, as long as we firmly remember two things: one is to absolutely listen to the Party, and the other is to resolutely get on the active service horse. Then, we will definitely be able to achieve success in the technical revolution, the cultural revolution, and the educational revolution.

    The third aspect of practice is social practice, participating in various social activities. And the most important thing at present is to participate in the communization movement in cities. Cities in our country are vigorously running people's communes, vigorously running street industries, vigorously running public canteens and various public welfare undertakings. Urban people's communes will not only liberate millions of urban housewives from housework and create favorable conditions for the development of urban production and construction, but they are also the best organizational form for further organizing people's economic and cultural life in cities and thoroughly transforming the old urban appearance. It is understandable that the working people in cities are welcoming urban people's communes with joy. We intellectuals should also treat urban people's communes with a correct attitude, cultivate good habits of collective life, cultivate collectivist ideas, better serve socialist construction, and thus strengthen the self-transformation of intellectuals.

    Strengthen Political Theory Study

    Another important aspect of the self-transformation of intellectuals is the issue of strengthening the study of political theory. The study of political theory should first of all be to study Marxism-Leninism. For us, the most important thing is to study the works of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's works themselves are a brilliant example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction. In the process of guiding the continuous victory of our country's revolution and our country's construction, Chairman Mao has enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's works contain an infinite treasure of truth. Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is of particularly great significance for thoroughly transforming the bourgeois stand and world outlook, and establishing the ideological will to serve socialism. Chairman Mao's works are very broad. He has made extremely outstanding contributions to the main aspects of Marxism-Leninism, such as philosophy, political economy, and socialist science. In my personal opinion, Chairman Mao's works on the theory of class struggle, the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, the mass line, walking on two legs, and handling contradictions among the people, the united front, etc., are of the greatest use to us. We must earnestly, systematically, and closely integrate with reality to study Chairman Mao's works, and make the study of Chairman Mao's works the central task of our political theory study.

    The continuous Great Leap Forward of our country's national economy in the past two years, as well as the inevitable continuous leap forward of the national economy in 1960, proves that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the banner of the victory of our country's revolution, but also the banner of the victory of our country's socialist construction. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future." Comrades, let us arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought in the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works that is surging across the country, actively participate in technical innovation, technical revolution, and cultural and educational revolution, better carry out political and ideological transformation, and make our contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland!

    Finally, I would like to say a few words about the current international situation. Every major event at home and abroad in the past year has proved that Chairman Mao's analysis and estimation are completely correct. The East wind prevails over the West wind. Imperialism is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Now the United States pretends to be peaceful to cover up the essence of its still preparing for a war of aggression, deliberately antagonizing the people of the world. We should continue to be vigilant. Some time ago, foreign reactionaries stirred up a gust of wind and clamored for anti-China and anti-Chinese. But we know that the reactionaries are only a very small number of people after all. The peace-loving people all over the world are on our side. We must, under the leadership of the Party, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and unite with the peace-loving people of the world to resolutely oppose colonialism, oppose imperialism, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, resolutely defend peace, oppose aggression, and support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Let us raise the bright banner of Mao Zedong even higher and move forward! Victory will always belong to us.

### 知识分子进一步改造的途径  沈钧儒副委员长在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言

    知识分子进一步改造的途径
    沈钧儒副委员长在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言主席，各位代表，各位委员：
    我怀着十分兴奋的心情听取了李富春副总理
  “关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。这两个报告全面深入地反映了一年来我国人民在党和毛主席的正确领导下所取得的伟大成就，展示了六十年代第一年我国社会主义建设波澜壮阔的局面。经过1958年以来的两年连续大跃进，我国人民已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。我国的经济面貌、政治面貌和社会面貌发生了前所未有的变化。这是六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的人民在我国社会主义建设史上写下的辉煌诗篇，它使帝国主义者惊惶失措，使全世界被压迫的人民欢欣鼓舞，为我国的伟大胜利而欢呼！
    形势越来越好
    我们的1960年国民经济计划，又是一个伟大的继续跃进的计划，是一个既有高速度又有按比例地发展的计划。现在看来，形势是越来越好了。首先，我们在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面战无不胜的红旗下，已经积累了比较丰富的经验。所以在今年一季度就出现了开门红，满堂红，月月红，日日红的崭新局面。最近，我国已经掀起了一个全民性的技术革新、技术革命的增产节约运动，这个运动汹涌澎湃，席卷全国。生产力正以一日千里之势迅速发展。同时，健全发展的农村人民公社正在力争农业的全面跃进，全国城市也在大办人民公社。城市人民公社的成长是我们实现1960年以及今后继续跃进的一个新的重大的积极因素。有了这些新的有利因素，我们深信，1960年的国民经济计划不但可以完成，而且一定会超额完成。我们一定可以做到用比十年更少的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，和提前实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要，并且提早把我国建成一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家。
    面对如此美好的形势，我们知识分子感到无限欢欣鼓舞。我们每个人都为生活在伟大的毛泽东时代而自豪。几年来，我们知识分子在党和毛主席的培养、教育下是有很大进步的。特别是最近两年，我们在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，在劳动群众的带动下，在积极服务中作出了更大的贡献，在政治思想上也有了很大的提高。许多人积极地参加了劳动实践，在劳动中锻炼了自己，向知识分子劳动化迈进了一大步；一些人积极地投身于技术革命、文化革命、教育革命中去，在教学、科学研究和生产建设上做出了成绩。有一些老年的知识分子和专家，也开始学会运用批评、自我批评的武器，运用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来批判资产阶级科学。这些显著的进步是应当肯定的。
    自然，知识分子的这些进步，如果和当前社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设飞跃发展的形势比较起来，那是大大不够的。我们的主观世界还远远落在客观世界的后面。譬如说，有些人看到了工农群众那种冲天干劲不但不想赶上去，有的甚至还感到紧张，有“歇一歇”的思想，个别的人甚至在大好形势面前有消极情绪和自卑感。又如有些人还留恋于旧的生活方式和工作方式，对集体生活感到不大习惯。当群众大闹技术革新、技术革命的时候，有的人还惯于关起门来单干，不相信科学研究和文教工作可以走群众路线，所有这些，在我看来，仍然由于资产阶级的立场和世界观还没有根本改造的缘故。因此，知识分子还必须在已经取得的进步基础上，继续前进，进一步彻底改造自己的立场和世界观，才能够使自己的主观世界适应客观世界的要求。目前的形势对我们知识分子的思想改造是十分有利的。我国工农业生产的不断跃进，已经促使思想的不断革命，而思想的不断革命又反过来影响和加速生产的跃进。我们知识分子改造也随着生产跃进与思想革命的不断深入而加速前进，这是完全合乎客观规律的。
    积极地参加实践
    我们知识分子进一步改造的途径，应该是一方面参加为社会主义服务的劳动实践，一方面加强马克思列宁主义的政治理论学习，这是我们自我改造必须努力的两个方面，要密切联系着进行，使两者可以互相促进，这也就是两条腿走路的办法。首先我们要更积极地参加实践。实践有三个方面：
    一是通过参加体力劳动，在劳动中向工人和农民学习，逐步培养劳动人民的思想感情，这不但可以锻炼我们的立场，还可以改造我们的思想，培养我们对劳动人民的感情。
    二是业务实践，做好我们的岗位工作。我们知识分子大多数是文化教育工作者，不少是科学技术工作人员，当前我国正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的群众性运动。这一运动对于我国社会主义建设的持续跃进具有深远的意义，李富春副总理报告中已讲得很清楚。我相信我们知识分子一定会以非常兴奋的心情积极地主动地投入到这个伟大的运动中去，坚决依靠党的领导，依靠广大工农群众，发扬敢想敢干和科学态度相结合的共产主义风格，破除迷信，苦干巧干，千方百计地献技献计，在技术革新和技术革命中做出我们的贡献。这种业务实践不但有利于社会主义建设事业，而且我们还可以在运动中学习工农群众那种冲天干劲，不畏困难，和把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的共产主义风格。在文化教育战线上，我国也正在掀起一个文化革命和教育革命的高潮，要高速度地普及文化教育，提高文化教育质量，尽快地培养出一支强大的又红又专的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论队伍，更好地配合和促进生产的大跃进，为我们的经济基础服务，在这方面我们知识分子所能够做的事情就更多了。在业务实践中，我们只要牢牢记住两句话：一是绝对听党的话，一是坚决上积极服务之马。那么，我们就一定可以在技术革命、文化革命、教育革命中做出成绩来的。
    实践的第三方面是社会实践，参加各种社会活动。而目前最重要的是参加城市的公社化运动。我国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办公共食堂以及各种公共福利事业。城市人民公社不仅将使千百万城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，为城市生产建设事业的发展创造有利的条件，而且它还是城市中进一步组织人民经济、文化生活和彻底改造旧城市面貌的最好组织形式。城市劳动人民所以兴高采烈地迎接城市人民公社，这是可以理解的。我们知识分子也应该以正确的态度来对待城市人民公社，养成集体生活的良好习惯，培养集体主义思想，更好地为社会主义建设服务，从而加强知识分子的自我改造。
    加强政治理论学习
    知识分子自我改造的另一重要方面，是加强政治理论学习的问题。政治理论学习首先就是要学习马克思列宁主义，对我们来说，最重要的就是要学习我们伟大的领袖毛主席的著作。毛主席著作本身就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设实践相结合的光辉范例。毛主席在指导我国革命和我国建设不断胜利的过程中，丰富了和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛主席著作中蕴藏着无限真理的宝藏。认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，对于彻底改造资产阶级立场和世界观，树立为社会主义服务的思想意志，具有特别重大的意义。毛主席著作的范围很广，他对马克思列宁主义的几个主要方面，如哲学、政治经济学和社会主义科学方面都有极其杰出的贡献。在我个人看来，毛主席著作中关于阶级斗争学说，党的领导、政治挂帅、群众路线、两条腿走路以及处理人民内部矛盾、统一战线等等学说，对我们的用处是最大的。我们一定要认真地、有计划地、密切地结合实际来学习毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作作为我们政治理论学习的中心任务。
    两年来我国国民经济的连续大跃进，以及1960年国民经济的必将持续跃进，证明了毛泽东思想不惟是我国革命胜利的旗帜，也是我国社会主义建设胜利的旗帜。李富春副总理在他的报告中指出：“认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。”同志们，让我们在全国正汹涌澎湃着的学习毛主席著作高潮里，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，积极投身技术革新、技术革命和文化教育革命中，更好地进行政治思想改造，为祖国的社会主义建设事业作出我们的贡献吧！
    最后，我想就目前国际形势说几句。这一年来国际国内每一件大事都证明毛主席的分析估计是完全正确的，东风压倒西风，帝国主义正在一天天烂下去，我们正在一天天好起来。现在美国假装和平姿态，来掩盖它仍在准备侵略战争的实质，蓄意与全世界人民为敌，我们应当继续保持警惕。前些日子国外反动派吹起一阵歪风，进行反华排华的叫嚣。但是我们知道，反动派到底不过极少数人，全世界爱好和平的人民是站在我们这一边的。我们一定要在党的领导之下，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，和世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决反对殖民主义，反对帝国主义，坚持和平共处的五项原则，坚决保卫和平反对侵略，支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。让我们更高举起毛泽东的光辉旗帜前进吧！胜利永远属于我们。
