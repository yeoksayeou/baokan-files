Expressing Determination to Reform with Practical Actions
Speech by Committee Member Tu Yuqing

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the continued Great Leap Forward of 1959, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within two years, and the great achievements of the vigorous and dynamic mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, are all inspiring and astonishing facts. For us old intellectuals, they should be enormously persuasive socialist and communist education. The transformation of old intellectuals should be a great spur. However, because bourgeois ideology and bourgeois standpoints, viewpoints, and methods are so deeply rooted in our minds, although we have made progress to varying degrees under the leadership and education of the Party, the transformation is still relatively superficial, remaining at a general rational level, and has not yet penetrated into thoughts and feelings. We have not yet truly and deeply understood the strong desire of 650 million people to rapidly change our country's poor and blank state reflected in the three magic weapons [General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes].

Recently, during my inspection work in Shanghai, I personally saw many facts that made me begin to more deeply understand the correctness, creativity, and far-reaching significance of the policy of "walking on two legs" - both indigenous and foreign methods. Furthermore, from the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, I saw the radiance of the General Line, the immense power of the mass movement, and the urgency of the transformation of intellectuals.

In the jade carving factory, in order to make the corundum into the sand slurry needed for grinding and cutting jade, which requires appropriate moisture, in the past, relying solely on heavy physical labor, several people had to constantly stir the sand and water in a pot with one hand and strike it with a hammer with the other hand to make the sand slurry. Now? It is these workers who have created a small motor and simple mechanical equipment to automatically stir and strike, causing the sand to settle into slurry. This transformed heavy physical labor into fully unattended automated operation.

At the construction site of the Pengpu Industrial Base, I saw an assembly line for mixing cement. Except for the manual shoveling of sand and gravel onto the conveyor belt, everything else was mechanized, and a fully automated device for controlling the composition of sand and stone was installed. Except for the cement mixer and the motor, all of this equipment was made by workers using old wood and bamboo strips. Heavy physical labor was almost completely replaced by machinery, greatly increasing the speed and solving the key problem of construction.

In the Zhangjiazhai neighborhood, I saw housewives using old scrubbing brushes, old soda bottle caps, and old chopsticks, respectively mounted on the same wooden shaft to make a semi-mechanized machine that can be used by hand for three purposes in one machine (old brushes to remove ribbonfish scales, soda bottle caps to remove yellow croaker scales, chopsticks to remove celery leaves), greatly reducing labor intensity and improving labor efficiency. There was also a woman who used the motor of a household electric fan and waste knives to complete copper wire rings in 75 minutes that originally took a day to make.

Such examples are by no means isolated, but extremely common, not isolated flowers, but a new atmosphere of blooming everywhere. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, this set of policies (referring to the policy of walking on two legs) not only mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and staff, but also mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and staff's families; not only mobilized the enthusiasm of people with relatively high technical levels, but also mobilized the enthusiasm of people with relatively low technical levels and even those without technical skills. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. For me, it is an extremely vivid and profound education.

I realized:

1.  The fundamental source of the power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes: - The laboring people, because they have long suffered from the pain of heavy physical labor, deeply understand in their own personal experience what it means to be poor and blank, and deeply recognize that only under the leadership of the Party and under the socialist system is it possible to get rid of the backwardness of being poor and blank. Therefore, under the call of the Party, the strong desire in their hearts becomes a surging, overwhelming drive. This makes me more deeply understand that the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command is the soul, the fundamental source of all power, and the fundamental guarantee of victory.

2.  The wisdom of the masses is inexhaustible: - The liberated laboring people, due to their rich experience in production struggles, know from practical experience where the key practical problems lie. Under the Party's enlightenment and support, they broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and their latent wisdom naturally emerged. Hard work and practical work have suddenly turned into ingenious work, and they have quickly embarked on the road to modernization.

3.  The combination of indigenous and foreign methods is more, faster, better, and more economical: - Facts have proved that the combination of indigenous and foreign methods has the broadest mass base and can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses. The combination of indigenous and foreign methods can fully utilize the rich experience of the masses. It can fully utilize the fine tradition of diligence and thrift of our laboring people, creatively utilize existing conditions to solve current practical problems, and because indigenous methods themselves are scientific, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods can better implement the policy of popularization and improvement, and better promote the high-speed development of China's science and culture. As Comrade Ke Qingshi said at the Shanghai Industrial Conference: "Indigenous methods are native, simple, but by no means backward, but advanced and scientific... To push the movement to a new upsurge, we must continue to break the superstitions of valuing foreign methods over indigenous methods and the concept of valuing the large over the small."

In contrast, bourgeois intellectuals have long lived leisurely lives, have always despised physical labor and the laboring people, and completely do not know what heavy physical labor is or the pain of labor intensity. They cannot have the same strong desire as the laboring people to change the face of poverty and blankness. Insufficient drive makes it impossible to truly and resolutely implement the General Line of more, faster, better, and more economical. The only way to catch up with the situation is to work hard to transform ourselves under the leadership of the Party, study Chairman Mao's works, link our thinking with reality, break bourgeois standpoints and viewpoints, establish proletarian standpoints and viewpoints, thoroughly eliminate the bad habit of despising labor through labor training, and gradually establish the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people. We must become working-class intellectuals who love the Party, love socialism, are loyal to the Party, and are loyal to socialism, just like the laboring people.

Secondly, bourgeois intellectuals have always separated theory from practice. What they know is only book knowledge. They are accustomed to circling in abstract theories and rarely have practical experience in production struggles. When encountering practical problems, even relatively simple ones, it is difficult to solve them. At present, with the high tide of economic construction and the high tide of the cultural revolution have arrived, thousands upon thousands of laboring people, in order to change the face of poverty and blankness faster, are pushing the technological revolution to a new stage, and urgently demand to learn culture and technology. The culture and technology they demand are by no means separated from politics or separated from practical production, but must be culture and technology that serves politics and serves production. This requires us intellectuals to make contributions. In order to better complete this task, we must thoroughly break the old thinking of valuing theory over practice and resolutely establish the new thinking of proceeding from reality in everything and from practice to theory. If we lack practical experience, we must seize various opportunities to work with the masses ourselves, accumulate practical experience more, faster, better, and more economically, and transform ourselves into intellectuals who combine theory with practice.

Thirdly, bourgeois intellectuals have always valued and worshiped foreign things, emphasized conditionalism, and believed that to engage in scientific research, modernization, mechanization, and automation, there must be conditions, and it must be foreign. It is not a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, but solely foreign methods, believing that technological innovation and technological revolution are mysterious peaks that only experts can climb, and the masses can't do much. The so-called conditionalism is just a subjective belief in the necessary objective conditions, not recognizing the great role of combining subjective initiative with objective possibilities. Therefore, they often hold a waiting mentality, becoming onlookers or stretchers. This kind of thinking and attitude is extremely incompatible with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In order to catch up with the situation and accelerate the shortening of the distance, we must thoroughly break the bourgeois erroneous thinking of valuing foreign things over indigenous things and aiming too high, actively throw ourselves into the ranks of the broad masses of the people, humbly learn from the masses, learn, do, and transform ourselves at the same time, express our determination to transform ourselves with practical actions, and contribute our strength to the socialist Great Leap Forward.

    用实际行动表示改造决心
    涂羽卿委员的发言
    1958年的大跃进，1959年的继续大跃进，两年内完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，轰轰烈烈热火朝天的技术革新、技术革命群众运动的伟大成就，都是振奋人心的惊人事实，对我们旧知识分子来说，应当是具有巨大说服力的社会主义和共产主义教育，对旧知识分子的改造，应当是莫大的鞭策，但是由于资产阶级的意识形态，资产阶级的立场、观点方法在我们头脑里是这样的根深蒂固，虽然在党的领导与教育下有了不同程度的进步，但是改造仍然是比较肤浅的，仍然是停留在一般的理性上，还未深入到思想感情。对于三大法宝反映了六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变我国一穷二白面貌的强烈愿望，还没有真正深刻的体会。
    最近我在上海的视察工作中，亲眼看见许多的事实，使我开始比较深刻的体会到土洋并举这两条腿走路的方针的正确性、创造性和深远的意义，并且从土洋结合看到总路线的光芒，和群众运动的巨大威力，和知识分子改造的迫切性。
    在玉石雕刻厂里，为要将金刚砂作成磨切玉石所必用的、具备适当水分的砂泥，过去单靠笨重体力，要几个人整天不断的在锅里用一只手搅动砂水，另一只手用锤敲打，做成砂泥。现在呢？就是这些工人创造了用一个小马达，和简易的机械装备自动的搅动和敲打使砂沉淀成泥。从笨重的体力劳动变为完全无人看管的自动化操作。
    在彭浦工业基地的工地上看见拌水泥的一条龙。除了将沙和石子要人工用锹装在运输带上以外，其余一概都是机械化，而且装了一个完全自动化控制沙、石成份的装置。这些装备除了拌水泥机和马达外，都是工人用旧木料、竹片等材料做成的，笨重的体力几乎完全为机械所代替，大大的提高了速度，解决了建筑施工的关键问题。
    在张家宅里弄看见家庭妇女用旧毛刷，旧汽水瓶盖，旧筷子，分别装在同一木轴上做成用手摇的一机三用的半机械化机器，（旧刷去带鱼鳞，汽水盖去黄鱼鳞，筷子去芹菜叶。）大大地减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动效率。还有一位妇女用家用的电风扇的马达和废刀将原来需要一天所做的铜丝圈在七十五分钟就可完成。
    这样的事例决不是个别的，而是极其普遍的，不是孤立的花朵，而是遍地开花的新气象。正如李富春副总理在他的报告中说，这一套方针（指两条腿走路的方针）不仅调动了广大职工的积极性，而且调动了广大职工家属的积极性；不仅调动了技术水平比较高的人们的积极性，而且调动了技术水平比较低以至没有技术的人们的积极性。这就是毛泽东思想的胜利，总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。对我来说是极其生动的深刻的教育。
    我体会到：
    一、总路线、大跃进、人民公社动力的根本泉源：——劳动人民由于长期受到笨重体力的痛苦，在自己的切身经验中，深刻地体会到什么叫一穷二白，深刻认识到只有在党的领导下在社会主义制度下才有摆脱一穷二白落后面貌的可能，因此，在党的号召下，内心的强烈愿望就一跃成为排山倒海的冲天干劲，这就使我更深刻的认识到党的领导、政治挂帅是灵魂，是一切动力的根本泉源，是胜利的根本保证。
    二、群众的智慧是无穷尽的：——获得了解放的劳动人民，由于他们的丰富的生产斗争经验，他们从实际出发知道实际关键问题的所在。在党的启发和支持下破除了迷信，解放了思想，潜在的智慧就自然而然的涌现出来，苦干、实干，一跃就变成巧干，就迅速地走上近代化的道路。
    三、土洋结合就是多快好省：——事实证明，土洋结合具有最广泛的群众基础，能全面调动广大群众的积极性。土洋结合能充分利用群众的丰富经验。充分发挥我国劳动人民克勤克俭的优良传统，创造性的利用现有的条件解决当前的实际问题，由于土办法本身是科学的，土洋结合就更能贯彻普及和提高的方针，更能促进我国科学文化的高速度的发展，正如柯庆施同志在上海工业会议上说：“土办法是土生土长的、简易的，但决不是落后的，而是先进的、科学的。……要把运动推向新的高潮，就必须继续破除重洋轻土的迷信和重大轻小的观念。”
    与此对比，资产阶级知识分子长期过着清闲的生活，一向轻视体力劳动与劳动人民，完全不知道什么叫笨重的体力，什么叫劳动强度的痛苦就不可能有像劳动人民一样有要改变一穷二白面貌的强烈要求，干劲鼓得不足就不可能真正的坚决的贯彻总路线多快好省的方针。要赶上形势唯一的出路，就是在党的领导下努力进行自我改造，学习毛主席著作联系思想联系实际，破资产阶级立场、观点，立无产阶级立场、观点，通过劳动锻炼彻底消除轻视劳动的恶习，逐步树立劳动人民的思想感情。要做到像劳动人民一样的热爱党热爱社会主义，忠于党忠于社会主义的工人阶级知识分子。
    其次，资产阶级知识分子一向理论脱离实际，所知道的仅是书本的知识，惯于在抽象的理论里兜圈子，很少有实际生产斗争经验，遇到实际问题，而且有时是比较简单的问题也很难解决，目前随着经济建设的高潮，文化革命的高潮已经来临，千千万万的劳动人民为了更快地改变一穷二白的面貌，将技术革命推向新的阶段，迫切地要求学习文化技术，而他们所要求的文化技术，决不是脱离政治脱离生产实际的，而必须是为政治服务为生产服务的文化技术，这就要求我们知识分子作出贡献。为要更好的完成这个任务，我们必须彻底破重理论轻实际的旧思想，坚决树立一切从实际出发，从实际到理论的新思想，若缺乏实际经验，就必须抓住各种机会与群众一起亲自动手，多快好省地积累实际经验，将自己变为理论联系实际的知识分子。
    再其次，资产阶级知识分子，一贯重洋崇洋，强调条件论，认为要搞科学研究，近代化、机械化、自动化，要有条件，而且非洋不可，不是土洋结合，土洋并举而是唯洋独尊，认为技术革新和技术革命只是专家才可攀登的神秘高峰，群众起不了什么作用，所谓条件论，只是主观的认为必须有的客观条件，不认识主观能动性与客观可能性相结合的巨大作用，因此往往抱着等待思想，成为观潮派，或伸手派，这种思想和态度是与大跃进的形势极不相容的，为要赶上形势，加快地缩短距离，必须彻底破除重洋轻土好高骛远的资产阶级的错误思想，积极投入广大人民群众的战斗行列，虚心向群众学习，边学、边干、边改造以实际行动表示自我改造的决心，为社会主义大跃进贡献出自己的力量。
