Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 7th: In order to gradually settle the herdsmen who have joined the agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, the provinces of Mongolia are launching a socialist competition movement to accelerate the settlement work.

At the end of last year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party pointed out that further consolidating agricultural and pastoral cooperatives economically and organizationally is the main task at present, and that gradually settling nomadic herdsmen is one of the important steps to consolidate the cooperatives. In accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Plenary Session, the provinces of Mongolia have recently formulated settlement plans for the cooperatives this year and have launched socialist competitions with each other. The settlement plans of various places are formulated according to the actual conditions of the local areas. For example, because there are forests in Bulgan Province, it requires the cooperatives to use the timber to build houses, so that 50% of the herdsmen will have houses before July next year. Kobdo Province in the west plans to settle a production team in each cooperative this year, reclaim wasteland, and expand the cultivated area by 30%. In East Gobi Province, bathhouses will be built in the center of the cooperatives, electric lights will be installed, and livestock sheds will be universally built.

Bayan-Ölgii Province, where 80% of the cooperatives already have houses, is preparing to ensure that all herdsmen have houses to live in this year. Before 1958, all the herdsmen in this province lived a nomadic life. Last year, the provincial party organization and the government took measures to use the existing local conditions to build schools, medical clinics, veterinary stations, entertainment rooms and houses, so that many beautiful villages have appeared on the originally desolate grasslands. While developing animal husbandry production, this province also pays special attention to agricultural production. The cooperatives have established agricultural specialized production teams to grow crops along the Khovd River. The herdsmen have also settled along the river, and most cooperatives have therefore established production organizations for transportation, carpentry, ironwork, and tailoring, expanding production.

### 进一步巩固农牧业合作社组织  牧民加速展开定居运动

    进一步巩固农牧业合作社组织
    牧民加速展开定居运动
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电　蒙古各省为使加入了农牧业合作社的牧民逐步定居，正在开展一个加速定居工作的社会主义竞赛运动。
    去年年底，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第四次全体会议曾经指出，进一步从经济上、组织上巩固农牧业合作社是当前的主要任务，而使游牧的牧民逐步定居则是巩固合作社的重要步骤之一。根据全会
  决议的精神，蒙古各省最近分别制订了今年合作社的定居计划，并且相互开展了社会主义竞赛。各地的定居计划是根据当地实际情况制订的。例如，布尔干省由于省境内有森林，于是便要求各合作社利用林木修建房屋，在明年7月以前使50％的牧民都有住宅。西部的科布多省计划在今年内使每个合作社有一个生产队定居下来，开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积30％。在东戈壁省，在合作社的中心地将修建澡塘，安装电灯，普遍修盖牲畜棚圈。
    现在80％的合作社已建有住宅的巴彦乌列盖省准备在今年内使全部牧民都有房屋可住。这个省的牧民在1958年以前还全部都是过着游牧生活。省的党组织和政府在去年采取措施，利用当地的已有条件修建了学校、医疗所、兽医站、娱乐室和住宅，使原来荒凉的草原出现了许多美丽的村庄。这个省在发展牧业生产的同时还特别注意农业生产。合作社成立了农业专业生产队，沿着科布多河种植庄稼。牧民们也定居在河流沿岸，多数合作社因此还建立了运输、木工、铁工和缝纫等生产组织，扩大了生产。
