The resolution on increasing agricultural production and developing agricultural production cooperatives, passed at the recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, was published on April 7th.

Cooperative Farmers Play an Increasingly Decisive Role in Rural Development
The Old-Style Countryside Will Become an Advanced Socialist Countryside

The resolution stated that as of March 31st, 85.3% of arable land in the German Democratic Republic belonged to the socialist sector. The resolution, in discussing the current flourishing agricultural cooperativization movement, stated that farmers are transitioning from "I" to "We."

The resolution stated that only in a fully cooperativized countryside can the preconditions be created for fully developing productive forces, leveraging all the advantages of large-scale socialist agricultural units, and overcoming the differences between urban and rural areas. The realization of agricultural cooperativization will also transform the old-style countryside into a progressive socialist countryside, thereby making a significant contribution to enhancing the strength of the German Democratic Republic. The new, growing cooperative farmers will play an increasingly decisive role in rural development.

The resolution stated that by the end of 1963, the domestic production of livestock products in the German Democratic Republic would basically meet the needs of the residents, and the output of livestock products per unit area of agricultural land would also exceed that of West Germany. The resolution called for the production of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and state farms to reach world levels during the Seven-Year Plan period (1959-1965), and for the production of all agricultural production cooperatives and state farms to gradually approach the highest levels of science and technology.

Germany has Set an Example of Achieving a Socialist Victory in Agriculture
Under Conditions of a Highly Industrialized Country

The resolution stated that the German Democratic Republic has set an example of achieving a socialist victory in agriculture under the conditions of a highly industrialized country, which is a huge assistance to the struggle of the working class, peasants, and all progressive forces in Western European countries to defend peace.

The resolution praised the movement currently developing in the countryside to strive to become "Socialist Labor Teams" and "Socialist Labor Collectives," as well as the mass movement to tap all potentials and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan. The resolution stated that as long as all existing potentials are utilized, the German Democratic Republic will possess the necessary prerequisites and conditions to improve the people's livelihood and welfare in the coming years by greatly increasing agricultural production and labor productivity, as well as reducing costs, exceeding the agricultural level of West Germany, and reaching world levels in certain sectors.

Completing the Agricultural Task is a Matter for the Entire Party Organization
Leading Cadres Must Participate More in Mass Work in the Countryside

The resolution then addressed the issue of strengthening leadership in all aspects in order to comprehensively promote and support the creativity and initiative of the working people on the agricultural front. The resolution called on party members in party organizations at all levels, state organs at all levels, the National Front, and mass organizations to support and more widely organize the movement in the countryside to overfulfill the 1960 plan targets, complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and promote the further development of the socialist transformation of agriculture. The resolution also required the party committees of districts and counties to treat the completion of the agricultural task as a matter for the entire party organization, and required leading cadres to personally participate more in mass work in the countryside.

The resolution stated that the party's county committees should better help the party's grassroots organizations in agricultural production cooperatives and state farms to improve their combat effectiveness, assign the most capable party members and non-party members to work in key production areas, and recruit outstanding elements into the party.

Production Should be Developed According to the Requirements of Large-Scale Socialist Agriculture
Industry Must Use Existing Technology to Support Agricultural Development to the Greatest Possible Extent

The resolution then addressed the methods of developing agricultural production. It stated that the requirements of large-scale socialist agriculture are: the comprehensive use and full utilization of modern agricultural machinery and equipment; the establishment of large-scale livestock breeding units; the implementation of production concentration and specialization; the improvement of the professional competence of all cooperative members and agricultural workers, and the training of more agricultural experts; the adoption of economic accounting systems, and the improvement of management methods.

The resolution stated that from 1960, at least 10% of arable land should be planted with corn, and the yield of silage corn should reach 660 quintals per hectare. The resolution then put forward targets for livestock development: the number of dairy cows should reach the original 1965 target in 1963; the number of pigs should reach 8,710,000 nationwide in 1960; and the number of hens should reach at least 8,000,000 in 1965. The resolution called for a significant increase in labor productivity in animal husbandry.

The resolution believes that the tasks of industry in supporting agricultural development are: to use existing technology to the greatest possible extent, to rapidly equip socialist agriculture with complete machinery and equipment; to integrate agricultural chemicalization as a solid component of large-scale socialist production; to improve agricultural construction capabilities, etc.

The final part of the resolution pointed out that the tasks of fully cooperativized villages and counties are: to increase commodity production and labor productivity in the shortest possible time, and to mobilize rural residents to build beautiful socialist villages.

The resolution pointed out, after discussing the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, that socialist relations of production already occupy a dominant position in the German Democratic Republic, and that agricultural production cooperatives and state farms have proven their superiority over scattered individual farmers and West German capitalist agriculture.

The resolution called on all democratic forces across the country to contribute all their strength to promote a sharp rise in agricultural production and labor productivity, reduce costs, further develop the socialist transformation of agriculture, and strive for an abundance of agricultural products.

    德国统一社会党八中全会决议指出
    德国农民正在从“我”向“我们”过渡
    农业全部合作化为充分发展生产力创造了前提
    全国人民应该贡献力量促使农业生产直线上升
    本报讯　最近召开的德国统一社会党中央委员会第八次全体会议上通过的关于增加农业生产和发展农业生产合作社的决议已经在4月7日公布。
    合作农民对农村发展日益起决定性作用
    旧式的农村将变成先进的社会主义农村
    决议说，到3月31日为止，德意志民主共和国已有85.3％的可耕地属于社会主义成分。决议在谈到当前正在蓬勃发展的农业合作化运动时说，农民正在从“我”向“我们”过渡。
    决议说，只有在全部合作化的农村中，才创造了这样的前提：充分发展生产力，发挥社会主义大型农业单位的一切优越性，以克服城乡差别。实现农业合作化还将使旧式的农村变成进步的社会主义农村，从而为增强德意志民主共和国的威力作出重大贡献。新的、正在成长中的合作农民对农村的发展将日益起着决定性作用。
    决议说，到1963年底，德意志民主共和国国内生产的畜产品将基本上满足居民的需要，按农业用地单位面积计算的畜产品产量也将超过西德。决议要求先进的农业生产合作社和国营农场的生产在七年计划期间（1959—1965年）达到世界水平，所有的农业生产合作社和国营农场的生产也应逐步接近科学技术的最高水平。
    德国树立了在高度工业化国家的条件下
    使社会主义在农业方面获得胜利的榜样
    决议说，德意志民主共和国树立了在高度工业化国家条件下使社会主义在农业方面获得胜利的榜样，这对西欧各国工人阶级、农民和所有进步力量的保卫和平的斗争，是一种巨大的援助。
    决议称赞了目前农村中发展着的争取成为“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义劳动集体”运动以及挖掘一切潜力超额完成1960年国民经济计划的群众运动。决议说，只要利用现有的一切潜力，德意志民主共和国将具备必要的前提和条件在今后几年内，通过农业生产和劳动生产率的大大提高以及成本的降低，提高人民生活福利，超过西德农业水平，并在某些部门达到世界水平。
    完成农业任务的问题是整个党组织的事情
    领导干部必须更多地参加农村的群众工作
    决议接着谈到通过加强各方面的领导以便全面促进和支持农业战线上劳动人民的创造性和积极性的问题。决议要求各级党组织，各级国家机关、全国阵线和群众团体中的党员支持和更广泛地组织农村中超额完成1960年计划指标、提前完成七年计划和促进农业社会主义改造进一步发展的运动。决议还要求专区和县的党委会把完成农业任务的问题作为整个党组织的事情，要求领导干部必须更多地亲自参加农村中的群众工作。
    决议说，党的县委会应该更好地帮助农业生产合作社和国营农场中的党的基层组织提高战斗力，分配最有能力的党员和非党员到各生产重点中去工作，并吸收优秀分子入党。
    应该根据社会主义大型农业的要求来发展生产
    工业要尽最大可能利用已有技术支援农业发展
    决议接着谈到发展农业生产的办法。它说，社会主义大型农业的要求是：综合使用和充分利用现代农业机器设备；建立大型牲畜饲养单位；实行生产集中和专业化；提高所有合作社社员和农业工人的业务能力和培养更多的农业专家；采用经济核算制，改善管理方法。
    决议说，从1960年起，至少要以10％的耕地种植玉蜀黍，并使青贮玉蜀黍的产量达到每公顷六百六十公担。决议接着提出了牲畜发展的指标：奶牛头数要求在1963年达到1965年的原定指标；猪在1960年全国达到八百七十一万口；母鸡在1965年至少达到八百万只。决议要求大大提高畜牧业的劳动生产率。
    决议认为，工业在支援农业发展方面的任务是：尽最大可能利用已有的技术，快速度地为社会主义农业装备完整的机器设备；把农业化学化作为社会主义大型生产的牢固组成部分；提高农业建筑能力等。
    决议最后一部分指出，完全合作化的乡村和县的任务是：在最短期间内，提高商品生产和劳动生产率，发动农村居民建设美丽的社会主义农村。
    决议在谈到巩固农业生产合作社的问题后指出，社会主义生产关系已经在德意志民主共和国占压倒优势，农业生产合作社和国营农场已经证实了它们比分散的个体农户和西德资本主义农业具有优越性。
    决议号召全国所有民主力量贡献全部力量促使农业生产和劳动生产率直线上升，降低成本，进一步发展农业社会主义改造运动，争取农产品达到丰裕的地步。
