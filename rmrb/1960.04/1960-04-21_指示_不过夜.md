    Implement Immediately

    Night fell, and the wind grew stronger. On the highway from Gangcheng to Shouzhang, a cyclist sped along. This person was E Zongmo, deputy secretary of the general Party branch of the Xu Xielou Management Area of the Gangcheng Commune in Chiping County, Shandong Province. He was hurrying back from a meeting of the commune Party committee, eager to return to the Xiyang Brigade to convey the commune Party committee's instructions on fighting the drought.

    It was late at night when he arrived at the office of the Xiyang Brigade. Production team leaders were studying their work, and they were excited to see the secretary return. Someone said, "We know that you always implement the Party committee's instructions immediately, so we've all been waiting for you."

    The next morning, the commune Party committee's instructions on fighting the drought were transformed into practical actions by the commune members. Within that day, the entire brigade installed eighteen waterwheels, built four new irrigation ditches, and irrigated a total of 4,700 mu of wheat. (Zhang Zhenhua)

    指示“不过夜”
    夜深了，风刮得越来越大。在由钢城通往寿张的公路上，一个骑自行车的人飞快地奔驰着。这个人是山东省茌平县钢城公社徐协楼管理区党总支副书记俄宗谟。他是刚刚从公社党委开会回来，忙着赶回西杨大队传达公社党委关于抗旱的指示。
    赶到西杨大队的办公室，已经是深夜了。生产队长们正在研究工作，看到书记回来了，人们都很兴奋。有人说，“我们知道你贯彻执行党委指示从来是不过夜的，所以大家都还等你。”
    公社党委抗旱的指示，第二天一早就变成了社员们的实际行动。在这一天之内，全大队安好了水车十八部，修建毛渠四条，共浇小麦四千七百多亩。　（张振华）
