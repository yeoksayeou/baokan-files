I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. I am not going to report on education work in detail, but will only discuss a few major issues in education work. Please give me your corrections.

Since the issuance of the "Instructions on Education Work" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council in 1958, under the victorious encouragement of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune Movement, and under the condition of greatly strengthening the Party's leadership, the Party's education policy has been implemented, and China's education has undergone tremendous development and profound revolution, completing the development targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the number of students enrolled in universities reached 810,000, which, together with 300,000 students in spare-time universities, exceeded the target of 850,000 in the Second Five-Year Plan; the number of students in various full-time secondary schools reached 12.9 million, also exceeding the planned target; the number of primary school students reached 90 million, and the enrollment rate of school-age children reached about 87%. Compared with 1957, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, the number of students enrolled in universities in 1959 increased by 84% compared to 1957, the number of students in various secondary schools increased by 82%, and the number of primary school students increased by 42%. Six million six hundred thousand people were freed from illiteracy in two years, and the pace of preschool education has also greatly accelerated. Education in minority areas has developed even more. Taking Xinjiang as an example, there are more than 950,000 students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools, accounting for one-sixth of the total population of the region, and the number of people participating in literacy campaigns and various levels of spare-time schools has reached more than half of the adult population.

The development of education in the past two years also has the following characteristics: (1) The number of schools has increased significantly, and the layout of schools has further adapted to the requirements of national economic development. The education quality of the newly built schools since 1958 has generally improved rapidly due to the active consolidation work. (2) Half-day schools have developed rapidly. The half-day agricultural middle schools (including other rural vocational middle schools) newly established in 1958 have already taken root in rural areas. There are currently more than 30,000 agricultural middle schools with 2.96 million students nationwide. The large-scale development of half-day middle schools in urban and rural areas will enable China to popularize junior high school education more quickly. (3) Industrial and agricultural spare-time education has developed rapidly. Due to the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production, especially the vigorous promotion of the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement in recent months, a mass movement of spare-time learning by workers and peasants has surged up. To date, the number of workers and peasants participating in literacy campaigns and spare-time schools at all levels has reached about 150 million. Spare-time education has made many innovations in both content and methods. The use of phonetic literacy methods to carry out literacy campaigns provides important experience for accelerating literacy. The rapid development of this "one leg" of spare-time education has greatly accelerated the process of cultural revolution in which the working people of our country are becoming knowledgeable.

What about the quality of education in the midst of this great development? It has not decreased, but has improved, and in some aspects there has been significant improvement.

First of all, the mental outlook of teachers and students has changed. In the past two years, with the continuous deepening and development of the education revolution, through social practice, and through the General Line education centered on studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the socialist and communist ideological awareness of the broad masses of teachers and students has been greatly improved, and new communist moral qualities are growing. Through labor training, through contact with workers and peasants, their labor perspective and mass perspective have been significantly enhanced, and they have also cultivated the class feelings of the working people. Currently, a large-scale mass movement to study Mao Zedong's works is rapidly unfolding among the broad masses of teachers and students, marking a new upsurge in Marxist-Leninist ideological education.

Productive labor has taken root in our schools. In the first half of last year, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, full arrangements were made for teaching, productive labor, and student life in full-time schools at all levels. Production labor bases have been gradually established and consolidated within schools, and fixed connections have been established with factories, mines, enterprises, farms, and people's communes outside schools, and productive labor has generally become regularized. In universities, the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research has been continuously developed and strengthened, promoting each other, implementing the mass line, and improving the quality of teaching. The characteristics of scientific research work in universities last year were: adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, the direction of serving socialist construction was clearer, research projects were more focused, the connection with practice was closer, and especially the mass line was adhered to, thus achieving greater success. The vigorous development of scientific research has strongly supported production and construction, played the role of a "one aspect army" in the national scientific undertaking, and enriched teaching content and promoted the improvement of teaching standards. Many students, through scientific research, through productive labor and internships, through the exploration, design, and construction of various projects, or through academic criticism, social surveys, grassroots work training, etc., have greatly improved in terms of professional knowledge, political and ideological level, and independent working ability. Students writing books, engaging in cutting-edge scientific research, and creating new products were unthinkable in the past, but are now not uncommon. Over the past year, the quality of teaching in primary and secondary schools has generally improved, students have learned basic knowledge more solidly than before, their language expression ability and mathematical calculation ability have improved, their social knowledge has become richer, and their labor habits and physical fitness have also been enhanced.

All the above shows that in our schools, the quality of education that develops morality, intelligence, and physical fitness in an all-round way is constantly improving, and in some aspects it has been significantly improved. The fact that the national economy has continuously leapt forward in the past two years has shattered the right-leaning opportunists' attacks on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Similarly, the tremendous achievements in education also prove that the Party's education policy is completely correct. Those who believe that "more and faster" in education cannot be achieved with "better and more economical," that "all-Party and all-people running schools" in a flexible and diverse way "messes things up," and that teachers and students participating in productive labor will reduce the quality of education and "not be worth the loss," etc., are completely wrong.

Although our education work has achieved great success, it is still far from meeting the needs of the high-speed development of the country's socialist construction. The current excellent situation of technological innovation, technological revolution, and the People's Communes has once again put forward a series of new requirements for education work. In the face of the new situation and new tasks, further implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction and the Party's education policy, and developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, has become our most urgent task. This requires us to actively improve and reform all aspects of our work with a spirit of continuous revolution, starting with the teaching reform in primary and secondary schools.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have continuously carried out teaching reform in full-time schools at all levels. Generally speaking, the reform achievements in higher education and secondary vocational education are more significant, although there are still many problems that need to be further reformed. In general education, although many achievements have also been made, the radical and necessary reforms to the school system, curriculum, and teaching content, etc., that have fallen behind the needs of China's socialist construction development have not yet been carried out, and there is still a relatively serious situation of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive."

What is the more serious situation of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" that exists in primary and secondary education? It mainly lies in the excessively long learning years (twelve years) and the low level of requirements. From primary school to middle school, it is divided into four stages, there are too many categories of courses, the focus is not prominent enough, and the old school's three-level cyclical approach is used, and there is too much unnecessary cyclical repetition in the curriculum content; thus affecting the good learning of major courses. Especially in middle school mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses, there are many outdated things from before the 19th century, and there is a lack of new content reflecting modern science and technology. All of the above is not only incompatible with China's socialist construction, but also incompatible with the intellectual development of young people, and is backward. There are also many problems in other teaching systems and teaching methods, which aggravate the "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" in general education. In order to meet the needs of all aspects of socialist construction, this situation of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" must be quickly overcome, and teaching must be reformed.

Since 1958, all parts of the country have carried out many teaching reform experiments in accordance with the "Instructions on Education Work" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. Recently, extensive discussions have been launched among educators. From the situation of experiments in various places and the opinions put forward in recent discussions, it shows that the current primary and secondary school years should be shortened, and can be shortened. After appropriately shortening the years, the level can also be appropriately improved. Some regions are experimenting with a five-year continuous system for primary schools, and it is estimated that the level can reach or even exceed the original six-year level. Some regions have experimented with a ten-year continuous system for primary and secondary schools, and some advocate a five-year continuous system or "three, two" system (three years for junior high school and two years for senior high school) for middle schools. Beijing Normal University advocates a nine-year continuous system for primary and secondary schools. These experiments or proposals all require raising the middle school graduation level to roughly equivalent to the current university freshman level. In addition to the above, there are other different experiments or proposals in various places. The central issue of education reform is to reform the curriculum, reform the teaching system and teaching content, and accordingly improve teaching methods.

The practices and ideas of all parties regarding teaching reform are generally as follows: First, some of the current courses in universities, middle schools, and primary schools should be appropriately delegated to each level. For example, the basic content of basic courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry in university science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine can be delegated to high school; all of primary school arithmetic and linear equations in algebra can be delegated to primary school. Second, subjects should be appropriately merged, content should be streamlined, and loops should be reduced. For example, primary school history, geography, and nature can be merged into a common sense course. Middle school Chinese and foreign geography and economic geography are merged into one geography course. The content of middle school history and geography should be thoroughly reformed and streamlined to reduce unnecessary loops. Third, textbooks should be reformed and levels should be raised. Outdated and cumbersome things should be removed, and knowledge of modern science and technology and production should be increased or deepened. For example, high school mathematics should add analytical geometry, differential calculus, and integral calculus, high school physics should add basic knowledge of semiconductors and deepen the basic knowledge of atomic nucleus physics, and high school chemistry should add basic knowledge of rare elements and deepen the basic knowledge of polymer compounds. Fourth, teaching methods should be further improved. The number of lecture hours should be appropriately reduced, the number of hours for minor courses should be reduced, and extracurricular reading, exercises, and tutoring should be strengthened; lectures should focus on key points and be taught deeply and thoroughly; major subjects should be examined, and some subjects can be examined less or not at all, while attention should be paid to the examination of usual learning performance.

From the inspection and analysis of the current curriculum and textbooks, and from the preliminary results of existing experiments, I believe that the above-mentioned ideas and practices are well-founded. As long as the work is done well, the years can be appropriately shortened and the level can be appropriately raised. This is because: First, appropriately streamlining and merging courses, vigorously innovating textbooks, and improving teaching methods can save a certain amount of time, allowing students to concentrate on learning major courses well. Full-time primary and secondary schools must learn Chinese (including Chinese and foreign languages) and mathematics well. These are the most basic tools that students must master. If they learn Chinese and mathematics well, other courses will be easier to learn. Second, today, the ideological awareness of the vast number of teachers serving socialist construction has greatly improved. Under the leadership of the Party committee, teachers of all subjects can strengthen communist collaboration, cooperate with each other, and actively improve teaching content and teaching methods, which can also appropriately reduce lecture time and strengthen extracurricular tutoring. Compared with the method of having more classes and less self-study time, this will greatly improve learning effectiveness. Furthermore, socialist society has opened up broad prospects for the all-round development of young people. Their participation in productive labor and social political movements has enriched their knowledge. The current curriculum and textbooks can no longer meet their requirements. Therefore, it is completely necessary and possible to appropriately raise the level of various subjects in primary and secondary schools.

To carry out teaching reform in primary and secondary schools, labor must also be appropriately increased. This is because the combination of education and productive labor is the central issue of the education revolution and is the fundamental way to cultivate new people with all-round development. Labor should not be neglected at any time. In the past, due to the limitations of labor conditions and the excessive number of class hours, it was impossible to arrange more labor time. In the future, by appropriately controlling the number of lecture hours, it will be possible to appropriately increase labor time while improving and strengthening teaching work. Under the favorable conditions of cities running people's communes and streets running industries, urban primary and secondary schools may also be able to arrange for more and better productive labor for teachers and students.

Timely teaching reform is an extremely good thing for national construction and the growth of young people. Through typical experiments, various regions have begun to explore some more efficient ways to carry out teaching work, which has created favorable conditions for teaching reform. We educators should be good at using existing experience, go all out, and actively start reforming to overcome "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive." I think this is what most educators are happy to do. However, any major reform must have a certain amount of preparation. Teaching reform must be based on ideological revolution, fully implement the mass line, and require large-scale experimentation to obtain more experience. Conclusions should not be drawn too early. The situation in various regions is also different. Therefore, the current approach should be for each province and city to make arrangements in light of local conditions and freely conduct experiments. The scale of the experiments can be larger, and the methods can be flexible and diverse. We must fully recognize the necessity and favorable conditions of teaching reform, actively carry out reforms with full confidence, reform what can be reformed, and reform as early as possible; but we must also estimate the complexity of teaching reform and carry it out in a prepared and step-by-step manner.

While reforming primary and secondary education, teacher education should also be reformed accordingly. The level of cultural and scientific knowledge in higher and secondary normal schools should be appropriately raised so that they are respectively equivalent to the level of comprehensive universities and ordinary middle schools. Educational subjects should be practical, streamlined, and focused. Ideological and political education in Marxism-Leninism should be strengthened. Teaching reform puts forward higher requirements for teachers. For this reason, it is necessary to seize the current in-service teacher training and improvement work, and adopt the method of "teach what you learn" and "make up for what is lacking" so that they can quickly undertake new teaching tasks.

Further implementing the Party's education policy, deepening the education revolution, and thoroughly carrying out the teaching reform process is also a process of struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. To deepen the education revolution and carry out teaching reform, we must first deepen the ideological revolution, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois idea of "education for education's sake" and various erroneous views in order to become truly conscious promoters of teaching reform. First of all, the Ministry of Education should make the greatest efforts in this regard.

Based on the guidelines and tasks of the national economic plan proposed by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, in 1960, under the conditions of strengthening leadership and overall planning, we should adopt a variety of forms to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to run schools, in order to develop education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To develop education, we must adhere to the Party's education policy, adhere to the policy of combining popularization with improvement and "walking on two legs," actively develop higher education and secondary education, accelerate the popularization of primary education, and at the same time vigorously develop industrial and agricultural spare-time education. The education departments should take supporting agriculture as a glorious and important task. More schools should be run by local areas to serve local production and construction. Necessary support should be given to minority areas and areas with a relatively weak foundation in education.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun has already talked about the main indicators of education in 1960. I have already talked about the important issues in general education regarding how to better complete this year's work tasks. Here, I will only briefly mention the following points:

(1) Actively develop full-time higher education and secondary vocational education. Vigorously improve quality. According to the principle of combining bold development with overall planning, we should set up all the cutting-edge science and technology majors that our country needs as soon as possible in full-time universities. At the same time, we should pay special attention to developing basic science majors such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and radio electronics in order to lay a good foundation for the development and improvement of science and technology. Appropriately adjust courses, add new courses, and actively innovate teaching content. On the premise of focusing on teaching, strengthen scientific research work, put politics in command, combine theory with practice, implement the mass line, and constantly pay attention to the arrangement of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research work, promote the spirit of communist collaboration, and strengthen collaboration inside and outside the school. The teaching and scientific research work of liberal arts in universities must be further reformed, carry out criticism of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism, expand and consolidate the ideological front of Marxism-Leninism, develop majors such as philosophy and social sciences, and accelerate the growth of the theoretical team.

We must concentrate our efforts on running a number of key universities well, gradually set up research institutes in key universities across the country, and train a large number of graduate students.

Actively develop secondary vocational schools to train intermediate construction talents.

In order to vigorously support agriculture and accelerate the training of specialized talents needed to achieve agricultural modernization, the development ratio of agricultural science majors should be appropriately increased, and majors related to agricultural mechanization should be strengthened. Vigorously develop and run agricultural middle schools well in order to accelerate the popularization of junior secondary education and play an active role in developing agricultural production and achieving agricultural modernization.

(2) Extensive development of industrial and agricultural spare-time education is the basic way to quickly realize the intellectualization of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and it is also an important way to train various construction talents. According to statistics from February of this year, among the employees under the age of 45 in the national industry, basic construction, transportation, finance and trade, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology systems, there are approximately more than 19 million people studying, including more than 4.6 million people participating in literacy studies. There are more than 8.8 million people studying in spare-time primary schools, more than 5 million people studying in spare-time secondary schools, and more than 160,000 people studying in spare-time universities. In the vast rural areas, approximately more than 130 million farmers are participating in spare-time studies. On this basis, if spare-time primary education is popularized immediately after eliminating illiteracy, and at the same time, spare-time secondary education and spare-time higher education are vigorously developed, then in three to five years, what a huge technical team will be trained! We can predict that by the Third Five-Year Plan period or a longer period of time, China will have millions or tens of millions of spare-time college and secondary vocational students. This is a remarkable thing. Running spare-time education should be tailored to local conditions. Night schools, correspondence schools, broadcast schools, and television schools can be run. As long as the principle of "combining production, unified arrangement, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and being flexible and diverse" is adhered to under the condition of ensuring production tasks, the masses' learning can be regular and lasting, and spare-time education can be continuously consolidated and improved. There is also the issue of further reforming teaching in spare-time schools, which should be paid attention to.

(3) Actively develop preschool education. Educating the new generation well is of great significance for thoroughly liberating women's labor force for national economic construction and for consolidating and developing rural and urban people's communes. In order to do a good job in preschool education, we must currently make plans, actively develop preschool normal schools, and at the same time, run a large number of short-term training courses to strengthen the work of training qualified kindergarten teachers and caregivers.

(4) Implement all-Party and all-people running schools on a larger scale and give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties. All industrial and mining enterprises, scientific research institutions, organizations, troops, people's communes, and urban streets throughout the country can run the schools they need. Not only can they run spare-time schools and half-day schools, but they can also run full-time schools; they can run universities and secondary vocational schools, as well as ordinary middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. The education plans of these schools can be flexible and diverse as needed. In running education in a big way, we should combine popularization and improvement, on the one hand, boldly develop and vigorously popularize; on the other hand, we must grasp key points and vigorously improve. From the central to the local level, in all levels and types of schools, we must run a number of key schools well, focus on improving quality, create experience, and drive the general.

(5) Actively participate in the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Introduce technical innovation and technical revolution into schools. Recently, hundreds of thousands of teachers and students from universities and secondary vocational schools in various places have actively participated in the current surging technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the movement, they have further combined with workers and peasants, promoted the communist style of daring to think and act and the spirit of communist collaboration, and have made many inventions and creations and received profound ideological training. At the same time, they have launched a movement to innovate school teaching tools. Based on the spirit of self-reliance, the broad masses of teachers and students, in conjunction with productive labor and scientific research work, have trial-produced new products, self-made instruments and other modern teaching tools, and enriched and updated the school's teaching equipment. With the assistance of relevant departments, education administrative departments at all levels are preparing to build and expand teaching instrument factories and science education film and slide production factories, and will gradually promote educational technology. Schools' large-scale production is greatly conducive to the "three-way combination" of schools, production departments, and scientific research institutions, conducive to tackling cutting-edge technology, and conducive to improving teaching quality and scientific level. This great mass movement of combining inside and outside the school and combining intellectuals with workers and peasants combines the three climaxes of ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution, and will have a huge and profound impact on deepening the education revolution, carrying out teaching reform, and developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Relying on the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for doing a good job. In the face of the new situation and new tasks, educators across the country must rely more closely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, adhere to implementing the mass line, and actively reform teaching work in order to develop education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    积极进行教学改革，多快好省地发展教育事业
    教育部部长杨秀峰的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理和谭震林副总理向大会所作的报告，我不准备详细地汇报教育工作，只谈教育工作中的几个主要问题，请指正。
    从1958年中共中央和国务院发出“关于教育工作的指示”以来，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动的胜利的鼓舞下，在大大加强了党的领导的条件下，贯彻执行了党的教育方针，我国教育事业有了巨大的发展，进行了深刻的革命，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划规定的发展指标。1959年高等学校在校学生达到八十一万人，连同业余高等学校三十万人，已经超额完成第二个五年计划中八十五万人的指标；各类全日制中等学校学生达到一千二百九十万人，也超过了计划所定的指标；小学生达到九千万人的指标，学龄儿童入学率达到87％左右。如果与第一个五年计划的最后一年——1957年相比，1959年高等学校在校学生比1957年增加了84％，各类中等学校在校学生增加了82％，小学生增加了42％。两年扫除文盲六千六百万人，幼儿教育前进的步伐也大大加快了。少数民族地区的教育事业有了更大的发展，以新疆为例，大、中、小学在校学生九十五万多人，占全区总人口的六分之一，参加扫盲和各级业余学校学习的人数已达成年人的一半以上。
    两年多来的教育事业的发展，还有下面几个特点：（一）学校数目大量增加，学校布局进一步适应了国民经济发展的要求。1958年以来新建的学校，由于积极进行了整顿巩固工作，教育质量一般很快地得到了提高。（二）半日制学校发展很快。1958年新创办的半日制农业中学（包括农村其他职业中学），已经在农村中扎下了根。全国现共有农业中学三万多所，学生二百九十六万人。半日制中学在城市和农村的大量发展，将使我国能够较快地普及初中教育。（三）工农业余教育发展很快。由于工农业生产的飞跃发展，特别由于近几个月全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动的有力推动，工农群众业余学习运动风起云涌，波澜壮阔。到目前为止，参加扫盲和各级业余学校学习的工农群众已经达到一亿五千万人左右。业余教育从内容到方法都有很多创造。利用注音识字的方法进行扫盲，为了加速扫盲提供了重要的经验。业余教育这一条腿的迅速发展，大大加快了我国劳动人民知识化的文化革命的进程。
    大发展中的教育质量怎样呢？不是降低了，而是提高了，某些方面还有显著的提高。
    首先是师生精神面貌的改变。两年来，随着教育革命的不断深入和发展，经过社会实践，经过以学习党的八届八中全会文件为中心的总路线教育，广大师生的社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟大大提高了，新的共产主义道德品质正在成长。通过劳动锻炼，通过和工农群众接触，劳动观点、群众观点显著增强了，也培养了劳动人民的阶级感情。现在，一个大规模的学习毛泽东著作的群众运动正在广大师生中迅速展开，这标志着马克思列宁主义思想教育的新的高涨。
    生产劳动在我们的学校中已经生了根。去年上半年，根据中共中央和国务院的指示，各级全日制学校对教学、生产劳动和学生生活进行了全面安排。学校内逐步建立和巩固了生产劳动基地，并和校外厂矿企业、农场、人民公社建立固定的联系，生产劳动一般做到了经常化。在高等学校中，不断发展和加强了教学、生产劳动和科学研究的结合，三者互相促进，贯彻群众路线，提高了教学质量。去年高等学校科学研究工作的特点是：坚持政治挂帅，为社会主义建设服务的方向更加明确了，研究项目更加集中，与实际联系更加密切，特别是坚持了群众路线，因而取得了更大的成就。科学研究的蓬勃开展，有力地支援了生产建设，发挥了国家科学事业中一个方面军的作用，并且丰富了教学内容，促进了教学水平的提高。很多学生通过科学研究，通过生产劳动和实习，通过各项工程的勘查、设计和施工，或者通过学术批判、社会调查、基层工作锻炼等等，在专业知识、政治思想水平和独立工作能力各方面，都获得了很大的提高。学生编书，搞尖端科学研究，创制新产品，在过去是不敢设想的事情，今天却不是个别的少数的了。一年来，中小学的教学质量普遍提高了，学生的基础知识学得比以前扎实，语文表达能力和数学运算能力都有所提高，社会知识较前丰富，劳动习惯和体质也有所增强。
    以上这一切都说明：在我们学校里，德智体全面发展的教育的质量在不断提高，某些方面还得到了显著的提高。两年来国民经济的连续跃进的事实，粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进、人民公社的进攻。同样，教育事业的巨大成就，也证明了党的教育方针是完全正确的。那些认为教育事业多快就不能好省，认为全党、全民办学，灵活多样，是“搞乱了”，认为师生参加生产劳动会降低教育质量，“得不偿失”等等观点是根本错误的。
    我们的教育工作，虽然取得了巨大的成绩，但是仍然远不能适应国家社会主义建设高速度发展的需要。当前技术革新、技术革命和人民公社的大好形势，又向教育工作提出了一系列的新的要求。在新形势新任务面前，进一步地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和党的教育方针，更加多快好省地发展教育事业，就成为我们最迫切的任务了。这就必须以不断革命的精神，积极进行各方面工作的改进和改革，这里首先是中、小学的教学改革。
    建国以来，我们对各级全日制学校不断进行过教学改革的工作。一般说，在高等教育和中等专业教育方面的改革的成绩较为显著，当然也还有许多问题，需要进一步地加以改革。而在普通教育方面，虽然也取得了不少成绩，但是对于落后于我国社会主义建设发展需要的学制、课程以及教学内容等重大方面，则还没有进行彻底的必要的改革，还存在着较严重的少慢差费的情况。
    存在于中小学教育中比较严重的少慢差费的情况是什么？主要在于学习年限过长（十二年），而要求的程度又低。从小学到中学分为四段，课程门类过多，重点不够突出，并且沿用了旧学校三级制的循环作法，课程内容存在着过多的不必要的循环重复；因而影响了学好主要课程。尤其是在中学数、理、化课程中，有不少是十九世纪以前的陈旧东西，缺乏反映现代科学技术的新内容。以上种种情况，不仅与我国社会主义建设不相适应，同青少年的智力的发展也是不相适应的，是落后的。在其他教学制度和教学方法上，也存在着许多问题，加重了普通教育的少慢差费。为了适应社会主义建设各方面的需要，这种少慢差费的情况必须迅速加以克服，教学必须进行改革。
    1958年以来，全国各地根据中共中央和国务院“关于教育工作的指示”，进行了许多教学改革的试验。最近，又在教育工作者当中展开了广泛的讨论。从各地试验的情况和最近讨论所提出的意见来看，都说明现行中小学年限应该缩短，而且可以缩短。适当缩短年限之后，程度还可以适当提高。有的地区试验小学五年一贯制，估计程度可以达到原来六年的水平，或者更高一些。有的地区试验了中小学十年一贯制，有的主张中学实行五年一贯制或“三、二”制（初中三年、高中二年），北京师范大学主张中小学实行九年一贯制，这些试验或主张，都要求把中学毕业程度提高到大约相当于现在大学一年级的水平。除上述以外，各地还有其他不同的试验或主张。教育改革的中心问题在于改革课程、改革教学制度和教学内容，并且相应地改进教学方法。
    各方面关于教学改革的作法和设想一般是这样：第一，将现在大、中、小学的部分课程，适当逐级下放。例如现在大学理、工、农、医等科的数、理、化基础课的基本内容，可以下放到高中；初中算术的全部和代数的一次方程，可以下放到小学。第二，适当地合并科目，精简内容，减少循环。例如把小学的历史、地理、自然合并为常识课。把中学的中、外地理和经济地理合并为一门地理课。对中学的历史、地理内容加以彻底改造、精简，减少不必要的循环。第三，改革教材，提高水平。去掉陈旧和繁琐的东西，增加或加深现代科学技术和生产方面的知识。例如高中数学增加解析几何、微分、积分，高中物理增加半导体、加深原子核物理等方面的基础知识，高中化学增加稀有原素、加深高分子化合物等方面的基础知识。第四，进一步地改进教学方法。适当减少讲课时数，减少次要课程时数，加强课外阅读、练习和辅导；讲课抓重点，讲深讲透；主要学科要进行考试，有些学科可以少考或不考，而注意平时学习成绩的考查。
    从对现行课程、教材的检查分析和从已有试验的初步结果来看，我认为上述种种设想和做法，是有一定的根据的。只要把工作做好，就可以适当缩短年限，适当提高程度。这是因为：首先，适当地精简合并了课程，大力革新教材和改进教学方法，就可能节省出来一定的时间，使学生集中精力学好主要课程。全日制中小学要学好语文（包括中文和外语）和数学，这是学生所必须掌握的最基本的工具。学好语文和数学，其他课程就比较容易学了。其次，今天广大教师为社会主义建设服务的思想觉悟大大提高了，在党委领导下，各科教师可以加强共产主义协作，互相配合，积极改进教学内容和教学方法，又可以适当减少讲课时间，而加强课外辅导，比起上课多而自习时间少的办法，会大大提高学习效果。再者，社会主义社会为青少年的全面发展开辟了广阔的天地，他们参加生产劳动和社会政治运动，使他们的知识更加丰富了，现行的课程教材，早已满足不了他们的要求，因此，适当地提高中小学各科的程度也是完全必要和可能的。
    进行中小学的教学改革，还必须适当地增加劳动。这是因为教育与生产劳动相结合是教育革命的中心问题，是培养全面发展的新人的根本途径。任何时候都不应对劳动有所忽视。过去由于劳动条件的限制和课时过多，不可能安排较多的劳动时间。今后适当控制授课时数，在改进和加强教学工作的同时，就有可能适当增加劳动时间。城市中小学在城市大办人民公社和街道大办工业的有利条件下，也有可能更多更好地安排师生的生产劳动。
    及时进行教学改革，对国家建设和青少年的成长，都是极大的好事。各地区通过典型试验，已经开始摸索到教学工作上更能多快好省的一些门路，这就为进行教学改革创造了有利的条件。我们教育工作者应该善于利用已有的经验，鼓足干劲，积极着手进行改革，克服少慢差费。我想这是大多数教育工作者所乐于从事的。但是，任何重大改革必须有一定的准备。教学改革必须以思想革命为基础，充分贯彻群众路线，在作法上需要经过较大规模的试验，取得较多的经验，不应过早作出结论。各地区情况也不同。因此，目前作法应当是，由各省、市因地制宜地作出安排，放手进行试验，试验规模可以较大一些，办法不妨灵活多样。我们既要充分地认识教学改革的必要性和有利条件，充满信心地积极地进行改革，能改则改，能早改则早改；又要估计到教学改革的复杂性，有准备有步骤地来进行。
    在改革中小学教育的同时，要相应地改革师范教育。高等和中等师范学校文化科学知识水平应该适当地提高，使其分别相当于综合大学和普通中学的程度。教育学科要切合实用，精简集中。要加强马克思列宁主义的思想政治教育。教学改革对教师提出了更高的要求，为此，当前就必须抓紧在职教师的进修提高工作，采取教什么、学什么，缺什么、补什么的办法，使他们能够迅速担负起新的教学任务。
    进一步贯彻党的教育方针，深入教育革命，彻底进行教学改革的过程，也就是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想斗争的过程，深入教育革命，进行教学改革，必须先深入思想革命，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，彻底批判资产阶级“为教育而教育”的思想和各种错误的观点，才能成为真正自觉的教学改革的促进派。首先教育部应在这方面作最大的努力。
    根据李富春副总理报告提出来的国民经济计划的方针任务，1960年，应当在加强领导、全面规划的条件下，采取多种多样的形式，充分调动社会上各个方面办学的积极性，以多快好省地发展教育事业。发展教育事业必须坚持贯彻党的教育工作方针，坚持贯彻普及与提高相结合、“两条腿走路”的方针，积极发展高等教育和中等教育，加速普及小学教育，同时大力发展工农业余教育。教育部门要把支援农业作为光荣的重要任务。要更多地让地方举办为本地区生产建设服务的学校。要对少数民族地区和教育事业基础较为薄弱的地区给予必要的支援。
    关于1960年教育事业的主要指标，李富春副总理已经谈到了。如何更好地完成今年的工作任务，关于普通教育方面的重要问题，我在上面已经谈了，这里只扼要地谈以下几点：
    （一）积极发展全日制高等教育和中等专业教育。大力提高质量。根据放手发展与统筹安排相结合的原则，在全日制的高等学校中尽早地把我国所需要的一切尖端科学技术专业设置起来。同时，还要特别注意发展数学、物理、化学、生物、无线电电子学等基础科学专业，为发展与提高科学技术水平打好基础。适当调整课程，增加新课程，积极革新教学内容。在以教学为主的前提下，加强科学研究工作，政治挂帅，结合实际，贯彻群众路线，不断注意作好教学、生产劳动和科学研究工作的安排，发扬共产主义协作精神，加强校内外的协作。高等学校文科的教学工作与科学研究工作必须进一步改革，开展对资产阶级思想和现代修正主义的批判，扩大和巩固马克思列宁主义的思想阵地，发展哲学、社会科学等专业，加速理论队伍的成长。
    必须集中力量办好一批重点高等学校，在全国重点高等学校逐步设置研究院，大量培养研究生。
    积极发展中等专业学校，培养中级建设人材。
    为了大力支援农业，加速培养实现农业现代化所需要的专门人材，应当适当地增加农科各专业的发展比例，并加强与农业机械化有关的专业。大力发展和办好农业中学，以加速普及初级中等教育，并对发展农业生产、实现农业现代化发挥积极的作用。
    （二）广泛开展工农业余教育是迅速地实现广大工农群众知识化的基本途径，也是培养各种建设人材的重要办法。全国工业、基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易、农林、水利、气象等系统中，四十五岁以下的职工，据今年2月份统计，在学的大约有一千九百多万人，其中参加扫盲学习的四百六十多万人。在业余初等学校学习的有八百八十多万人，在业余中等学校学习的有五百多万人，在业余高等学校学习的达十六万多人。在广大农村中，参加业余学习的农民约有一亿三千多万人。在这个基础上，如果在扫除文盲之后，随即普及业余初等教育，同时大办业余中等教育和业余高等教育，则三、五年之后，将会培养出一支多么巨大的技术队伍！我们可以预计，到第三个五年计划时期或更长一些时间，我国的业余大专、中专学生将会有几百万，上千万。这是一件了不起的事情。举办业余教育应该因地制宜，可以办夜校，也可以办函授学校，还可以办广播学校和电视学校。只要在保证生产任务的条件下，坚持贯彻“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的原则，就能使群众的学习经常持久，使业余教育不断巩固和提高。在业余学校中也还有进一步地改革教学的问题，应该注意。
    （三）积极发展幼儿教育。教养好新生一代，这对于彻底解放妇女劳动力投入国家经济建设，巩固和发展农村和城市人民公社，具有重大的意义。为了做好幼儿教育的工作，当前必须作好规划，积极发展幼儿师范，同时要大量举办短期训练班，加强培养合格的幼儿园师资和保育人员的工作。
    （四）更大规模地实行全党全民办学、充分发挥各方面的积极性。全国一切工矿企业、科学研究机构、机关团体、军队、人民公社、城市街道都可以办自己所需要的学校。不但可以办业余学校、半日制学校，还可以办全日制学校；既可以办高等学校和中等专业学校，也可以办普通中学、小学和幼儿园。这些学校的教育计划可以视需要灵活多样。在大办教育事业中，普及与提高结合，一方面放手发展，大力普及；另一方面必须掌握重点，大力提高。从中央到地方，在各级各类学校中，都要办好一批重点学校，着重提高质量，创造经验，带动一般。
    （五）积极参加全民的技术革新和技术革命运动。把技术革新和技术革命引入学校。最近一个时期，各地高等学校和中等专业学校的几十万师生，积极投入了当前汹涌澎湃的技术革新和技术革命运动。在运动中，他们进一步与工农结合，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格和共产主义协作精神，有了很多的发明创造，受到了深刻的思想锻炼。同时又掀起了学校教学工具的革新运动。广大师生本着自力更生为主的精神，结合生产劳动和科学研究工作，试制新产品，自制仪器和其他现代化的教学工具，充实和更新了学校的教学设备。各级教育行政部门在有关部门的协助下，正在筹建、扩建教学仪器厂和科学教育电影幻灯制片厂，将逐步推广电化教学。学校大搞生产，大大有利于学校、生产部门、科学研究机构的“三结合”，有利于攻尖端，有利于提高教学质量和科学水平。这个校内外结合、知识分子与工农群众结合的伟大的群众运动，把思想革命、技术革命、文化革命三个高潮汇合在一起，将对深入教育革命，进行教学改革，多快好省地发展教育事业，产生巨大而深刻的影响。
    依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是做好工作的根本保证。在新形势和新任务的面前，全国教育工作者，必须更加紧密地依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，坚持贯彻群众路线，积极改革教学工作，才能更加多快好省地发展教育事业。
