Fuzhou, April 27 (From our Newspaper) Xiaotao Commune in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, relying on its own strength and using indigenous methods, has vigorously developed mountainous hydraulic and hydroelectric power clusters, evolving from the past scattered and single constructions to a new stage of planned cascade development and comprehensive utilization. At present, the commune has successively built more than 460 hydraulic and hydroelectric power stations, providing more than 1,500 horsepower of power for the commune's industrial and agricultural production. These hydro stations and hydroelectric stations are mostly concentrated on one aqueduct or in one area, forming power clusters. The commune has also built many iron smelting plants, bamboo and wood factories, and agricultural and sideline product processing factories around the "power clusters," establishing "industrial clusters" in the areas where the "power clusters" are located. At present, in the industrial and agricultural production of Xiaotao Commune, some heavy manual labor has been replaced by power. More than ten production activities such as iron smelting, agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, agricultural and sideline product processing, and sewing, have achieved power operation, saving more than 350,000 labor days annually. In the labor village section, on a canal of more than 300 meters long, the commune built a small hydropower station and eight hydropower stations, totaling more than 150 horsepower. Around this "power cluster," 89 indigenous and foreign machines and tools were installed for iron smelting, sawing wood, splitting bamboo, sewing, and feed processing. The work efficiency of each production has been increased several times to ten times compared to the original manual operation. This "power cluster" and the "industrial cluster" it has driven have further promoted the commune's industrial and agricultural technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The machine repair workshop, using hydropower to drive lathes, planers, drilling machines, and other machines, has produced more than 50 rice milling machines and more than 20 wooden water turbines in the past three months alone.

Driven and promoted by various "power clusters," the commune-run industry has built more than 40 new "small indigenous clusters" and small factories and mines, such as forest chemical industry, manganese mines, machinery, ceramics, bricks and tiles, lime, and other processing, on the basis of only a few factories such as farm tool repair and agricultural and sideline product processing. The original production processes that used a lot of manual labor have been replaced by power-driven and mechanical, semi-mechanical operations. Due to the presence of "power clusters" and "industrial clusters," a large number of rural labor forces have been saved and put into production, making spring production earlier, faster, and better than in any previous year.

    小陶公社建成水动力加工群
    围绕动力群建立工业群促进工农业生产
    本报福州27日电　福建省永安县小陶公社依靠自己的力量，土法上马，大搞山区水力、水电动力群，从过去分散单座建设发展成为有计划的梯级开发和综合利用的新阶段。目前全社已先后建起水力、水电站四百六十多座，为公社工农业生产提供了一千五百多马力的动力。这些水力站和水电站多集中建设在一道水渠或一个地区，构成了动力群。公社又围绕“动力群”修建起很多炼铁厂、竹木厂、农副产品加工厂等，在“动力群”的地方，又建立了“工业群”。目前，小陶公社的工农业生产中，一部分笨重的体力劳动已为动力所代替，单是炼铁、农械修配制造、农副产品加工、缝纫等十多项生产，由于实现了动力操作，每年即可节省三十五万多个劳动日。公社在劳动村一段三百多米长的渠道上，建起一座小型水电站和八座水力站，共一百五十多马力，围绕这个“动力群”，安装了八十九台土洋机械和机具，进行炼铁、锯木、破篾、缝纫和饲料加工，各项生产都比原来手工操作提高工效数倍到十倍。这个“动力群”和被它带动的“工业群”，又进一步推动了公社工、农业技术革新和技术革命运动，仅是机修车间、利用水力带动车床、刨床、钻床等机器，在最近三个多月里就生产砻谷机五十多部，木质水轮机二十多部。
    在各“动力群”的推动和带动下，社办工业已在原来只有农具修配、农副产品加工等少数几个工厂的基础上，新建了林产化工、锰矿、机械、陶瓷、砖瓦、石灰和其他加工等“小土群”、小厂矿四十多个，把原来大量用手工操作的生产工序改用动力带动和机械、半机械操作。由于有了“动力群”和“工业群”，节省出大批农村劳动力投入生产，使春季生产比以往任何一年都搞得早搞得快搞得好。
