(This article was transmitted by this newspaper from Changchun on the 5th) Jilin Province has launched a month-long province-wide mass inspection and summary of the technological innovation and revolution movement, starting from the end of March, to develop the movement along a correct, scientific, and all-people's track, comprehensively improve the production level of all enterprises, and achieve continuous increases in production.

Currently, all cities, regions, prefectures, and counties in the province are proceeding with the large-scale inspection and summary according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. In areas such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Tonghua, Baicheng, and Yanbian, the industrial secretaries are in command, and five-level cadre meetings have been widely convened to discuss the situation, explain policies, assign tasks, and provide methods. Jilin City, which acted the earliest, formed a "Thousand-Person Hundred-Group" inspection team composed of over a thousand cadres, adopting a combination of leadership and the masses, and self-inspection and mutual inspection to inspect every factory and mine. Through fifty-six on-site meetings, they summarized and exchanged more than five hundred and eighty innovative experiences and assembled eighty-three sets of complete experiences. Changchun City held a broadcast conference at the end of March, which was listened to by more than 200,000 workers. After the meeting, the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee, various industrial systems, and large, medium, and small enterprises all formed inspection teams to conduct inspections, summaries, exchanges, and promotion of advanced experiences in various industries and factories throughout the city.

So far, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments of Jilin Province has increased from 38% at the beginning of the year to over 50%. More than four hundred factories have achieved "one factory equaling several factories" without increasing investment, equipment, or production area, and production levels have greatly improved. From a general perspective, the technological innovation and revolution movement is expanding in an increasingly broad, mass direction. However, judging from the situation in the province as a whole, the development of the movement is not balanced enough. To further strengthen the leadership of the technological innovation and revolution movement and consolidate and expand the results of the movement, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to immediately launch a massive mass inspection and summary movement throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee requires that this movement achieve: further mobilizing the masses, educating the masses, and improving leadership levels; discovering, summarizing, and exchanging more advanced experiences, and greatly improving production levels; strengthening key points, eliminating and reducing backward units, and breaking through weak links, thereby taking industry as the lead to promote the technological innovation and revolution movement in agriculture, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, culture and education, and other fields to a new peak.

The method of the large-scale inspection and summary is to mobilize the broad masses of workers to participate, hold cadre meetings and on-site meetings, mobilize all levels from top to bottom, and adopt self-inspection and mutual inspection methods such as large-scale mobilization, large-scale battles, large-scale inspections, and large-scale evaluations to mobilize the masses from groups, work sections, and workshops to factories, districts, and cities, and to make summaries at each level. The combination of bottom-up inspection and top-down inspection, and the combination of mass summary and leadership thematic summary will be used.

This mass inspection and summary will promote the deeper development of the province's technological innovation and revolution movement from ideological, organizational, and material aspects, and set off a new upsurge of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and revolution to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Jilin Electric News: Jilin City organized a "Thousand-Person Hundred-Group" inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection and summary of the city's technological innovation and revolution movement, consolidating and expanding the results of innovation, and pushing the mass innovation movement to a new peak.

From February 25th to March 29th, under the unified leadership of the Jilin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city mobilized more than a thousand cadres from municipal direct agencies (including more than a hundred bureau and section chiefs), formed a hundred inspection groups, and divided them into ten inspection groups according to metallurgy, chemical industry, machinery, mines, power, light industry, capital construction, transportation, finance and trade, and county and commune industries to conduct a comprehensive inspection and summary of the city's technological innovation movement. The massive inspection and summary movement was conducted in a way that combined leadership and the masses, and self-inspection and mutual inspection.

The focus of the work of the "Thousand-Person Hundred-Group" inspection team was to summarize and improve technological innovation experiences and popularize and expand technological innovation achievements. It was both an inspection team, a promotion team, a collaboration team, and an experience dissemination team. Wherever the inspection team went, it both learned and shared treasures. During its work, the inspection team summarized and exchanged a large amount of experience. The inspection team also organized scientific and technological cadres and workers to write the summarized experiences into articles, compiled and printed them, and promoted them in a planned way. Through the above work, a large amount of dispersed mass wisdom has been gathered and improved into scientific and systematic innovation results, becoming social wealth, which will greatly promote the development of production.

The city's inspection and summary work was carried out in two stages. The first stage was a general inspection and general summary; the second stage was a key inspection and systematic summary. The work in the first stage promoted the comprehensive formation of a climax in the city's technological innovation and revolution movement, promptly resolved general problems that arose in the mass movement, and widely summarized the innovative creations of the masses. The work in the second stage raised the mass technological innovation and revolution movement a step further, so that it would develop continuously and in ever-increasing waves. It conducted special studies on major and common problems that arose in the movement, and conducted special summaries on major innovation projects created by the masses. For example, as a result of technological innovation, the production capacity of the city's industrial front has greatly increased, and the demand for raw materials has greatly increased. The inspection team organized a comprehensive utilization group to explore the sources of some raw materials through comprehensive utilization. Due to the increase in the degree of mechanization and automation of various enterprises, a large number of labor forces have been saved, and labor organizations are required to be adjusted and improved accordingly. The inspection team organized a staffing group to conduct a general survey of the city's labor force staffing and proposed a plan to adjust and improve the city's labor organization. In addition, more than ten special inspection groups such as county and commune industries, mining systems, and power systems were organized to conduct special investigations. The relevant departments of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee focused on summarizing the specific experience of leading the technological innovation and revolution movement; summarizing the experience of ideological work in the technological innovation movement; summarizing the experience of improving enterprise management; and exploring and studying the development law of the technological innovation and revolution movement.

Through the large-scale inspection and summary movement that lasted for more than a month, the city's technological innovation and revolution movement has leaped to a new peak. Now, the average number of innovation proposals put forward by workers every day has reached more than 4,700, and 43 industrial and mining enterprises and 506 workshops (construction sites, work sections) have achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized production. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has reached 62.2%, an increase of 8.3% compared with before the inspection, and the labor force saved has increased from more than 5,000 to more than 10,000. In order to continuously promote the development of the movement, the city has launched a second wave of inspection and summary since March 30, and the scope of inspection and summary will be wider.

    推动技术革命沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道发展
    吉林全省大检查大总结
    吉林市“千人百组”检查团巩固和扩大了技术革新成果
    本报长春5日电　吉林省从3月底起，在全省范围内展开一次为期一月的技术革新和技术革命运动的全民性的大检查、大总结，以便使运动沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道向纵深发展，全面提高所有企业的生产水平，实现生产步步高升。
    目前，全省各市、地、州、县，正在根据省委的指示，着手进行大检查、大总结。长春、吉林、四平、通化、白城、延边等地区都由工业书记挂帅，普遍召开了五级干部会议，讲形势，讲政策，交任务，交办法。行动最早的吉林市，由一千多名干部组成“千人百组”检查团，采取领导与群众相结合、自查与互查相结合的形式，检查了每一个工厂和矿山，通过五十六次现场会，总结和交流了五百八十多项革新经验，配成了八十三套成套的经验。长春市在3月底召开了有二十多万职工收听的广播大会。会后，市委工业部、各产业系统、各大中小企业，都组成了检查团，分别深入到全市各行业各工厂进行检查、总结，交流和推广先进经验。
    到目前为止，吉林省工业、交通运输、基本建设部门机械化半机械化程度，已由年初38％提高到50％以上，有四百多个工厂在不增加投资、不增加设备和生产面积的条件下，实现了“一厂顶数厂”，生产水平都有很大提高。技术革新和技术革命运动从总的方面来看，是朝着日益广阔的全民性的方向扩展，但就全省情况来看，运动的发展还不够平衡。为了进一步加强对技术革新和技术革命运动的领导，巩固和扩大运动成果，中共吉林省委决定在全省立即掀起一个声势浩大的全民大检查、大总结运动。省委要求在这次运动中要达到：进一步发动群众，教育群众，提高领导水平；更多地发现总结与交流先进经验，大大提高生产水平；加强重点，消除和减少落后单位，突破薄弱环节，从而以工业为主导，把农业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸文教等方面的技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个新的高峰。
    大检查、大总结的方法，是发动广大职工参加，开干部大会、现场会，上下一齐动，采用大发动、大会战、大检阅、大评比的自查、互查方法，从小组、工段、车间到厂、区、市发动群众层层检查，层层作出总结。把自下而上的检查和自上而下的检查结合起来，把群众性的总结和领导上的专题总结结合起来。
    这次全民性的大检查、大总结，将从思想上，组织上，物质上，推动全省技术革新和技术革命运动更深入地发展，掀起迎接“五一”国际劳动节和以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的新高潮。
    据新华社吉林电　吉林市组织“千人百组”检查团，对全市技术革新和技术革命运动进行全面大检查、大总结，巩固和扩大了革新成果，把全民性的革新运动推向新的高峰。
    从2月25日到3月29日，在中共吉林市委统一领导下，全市动员市直属机关一千多名干部（其中包括一百多个局、处长以上的领导干部），组成一百个检查组，按照冶金、化工、机械、矿山、电力、轻工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸、县社工业等系统，分成十个检查团，对全市的技术革新运动进行了全面大检查、大总结。声势浩大的检查和总结运动，是采取领导与群众相结合、自查与互查相结合的方式进行的。
    “千人百组”检查团的工作重点，是总结和提高技术革新经验，普及和扩大技术革新成果。它既是检查团、促进团，又是协作团和经验传播团。检查团每到一处，既取经也送宝。检查团工作期间，总结和交流了大量经验。检查团还组织了科学技术干部和工人一道，把一部分经过总结的经验写成文章，编印成册，有计划地推广。经过上述工作，大量的分散的群众智慧，已汇集和提高为科学的系统的革新成果，成为社会财富，对于促进生产发展将起很大作用。
    全市检查和总结工作是分两个阶段进行的。第一个阶段是普遍检查、普遍总结；第二个阶段是重点检查，系统总结。通过第一个阶段工作，促进了全市的技术革新和技术革命运动全面形成高潮，对于群众运动中出现的一般问题及时加以解决，对于群众的革新创造进行了广泛的总结。通过第二个阶段工作，把全民的技术革新和技术革命运动提高一步，使之持续地、一浪高一浪地发展，对于运动中出现的重大的有普遍意义的问题进行了专题研究，对于群众创造的重大革新项目进行了专项总结。例如，由于技术革新的结果，全市工业战线的生产能力大大提高，原料材料需要量大大增多，检查团即组织了综合利用小组，准备通过综合利用的途径，开辟部分原料材料的来源。由于各企业机械化、自动化程度的提高，节约了大批劳动力，要求劳动组织相应调整和改善，检查团就组织了定员编制小组，对于全市的劳动力编制问题进行了普遍调查，提出了调整和改善全市劳动组织的方案。此外，还组织了县社工业、矿山系统、电力系统等十多个专门检查组，分别进行了专题调查。市委和市人委的有关部门着重总结了领导技术革新和技术革命运动的具体经验；总结了技术革新运动中思想工作的经验；总结了改进企业管理的经验；并且探讨和研究了技术革新和技术革命运动的发展规律。
    通过历时一个多月的大检查和大总结运动，全市技术革新和技术革命运动已跃入新的高峰。现在，职工们每天提出的革新建议平均达到四千七百多件，有四十三个工矿企业、五百零六个车间（工地、工段）实现了机械化和半机械化生产，全市机械化和半机械化程度达到62.2％，比检查前提高8.3％，节约的劳动力由五千多人增加到一万多人。为了不断推动运动的发展，从3月30日起，全市又掀起第二次检查和总结高潮，检查和总结的范围将更加广泛。
