Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference,

On the occasion of the opening of the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, I would like to express my warm congratulations to the conference on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name.

Striving for national independence and developing national economies, and quickly shaking off poverty and backwardness are the common aspirations of the people of Asian and African countries. Since the Bandung Conference, this struggle has developed significantly and achieved great success. In the future, the Chinese people will continue to unite closely and support each other with the people of Asia and Africa in this common cause. I sincerely congratulate the conference on further strengthening and consolidating the friendly unity of the Asian and African people on the basis of carrying forward the Bandung spirit, and making greater contributions to the cause of national liberation movements and the defense of world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 9th to the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, which will be held in Conakry, Guinea on the 11th, to express warm congratulations on the opening of the conference on behalf of the Chinese workers.

The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: "Since the last conference, the struggles of the Asian and African countries, especially the African people, against imperialism and colonialism, and for the achievement and safeguarding of national independence and democratic freedoms, have undergone further and tremendous development, giving imperialism a heavy blow. At present, although imperialism, headed by the United States, is still doing its utmost to obstruct the people of Asian and African countries from obtaining genuine independence and to provoke disunity among Asian and African countries, we firmly believe that these conspiracies will be met with more thorough failures.

"The Chinese workers and people have always sympathized with and supported the national independence struggles of the people of Asian and African countries, and have established and developed a solid friendship with the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle against the common enemy—imperialism. This friendship and mutual support have played a huge role in defeating the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. We firmly believe that as long as the people of Asia and Africa are united as one and persist in the struggle, with the support of the socialist camp countries and the peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world, the imperialist aggressive forces must be driven out of the Asian and African regions, and the national liberation cause of Africa must achieve final victory. We wish the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference make significant contributions to this struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th. The National Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram to the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference on the 9th, warmly congratulating the opening of the conference.

The telegram from the National Women's Federation said: "Since the First Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, the people and women of Asia and Africa have achieved a series of major victories in the struggle against imperialism, for the achievement and safeguarding of national independence, giving imperialism a heavy blow. Now the people of Asia and Africa are fighting heroically to completely eradicate imperialist and colonial rule. We sincerely hope that this conference will make new contributions to the further development and consolidation of the great unity of the people and women of Asian and African countries, and to further encouraging and promoting the victory of the Asian and African national independence movement.

"Let the 1.7 billion people and women of Asia and Africa unite more closely, continue to carry forward the Bandung spirit and the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and bravely advance, holding high the banner against imperialism and colonialism!"

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, warmly congratulating the opening of the conference.

The telegram from the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation said: "In recent years, the national democratic movements in Asian and African countries have flourished, especially the struggle of the African people against imperialism and for national independence has formed a magnificent torrent, causing the colonial system of imperialism to move towards collapse. The Chinese youth firmly believe that the conference will further promote the friendship and unity of the people of Asian and African countries, and encourage and promote the struggle of the people and youth of Asian and African countries against imperialism, against colonialism, for the achievement and safeguarding of national independence, and for the defense of world peace."

    全总的电报说：“自上届大会以来，亚非各国，特别是非洲人民，反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立和民主自由的斗争又有了进一步的巨大发展，给予了帝国主义以沉重的打击。目前尽管以美国为首的帝国主义还在极力阻挠亚非各国人民获得真正的独立，挑拨亚非各国的团结，但是我们深信这些阴谋必将遭到更彻底的失败。
    “中国工人和人民一贯同情和支持亚非各国人民的民族独立斗争，并在反对共同敌人——帝国主义的斗争中同亚非各国人民建立与发展了巩固的友谊，这种友谊与相互支援已在击败帝国主义侵略阴谋的斗争中发挥了巨大的作用。我们深信：只要亚非人民团结一致，坚持斗争，在社会主义阵营各国和世界爱好和平与正义人民的支持下，帝国主义侵略势力一定要从亚非地区被驱逐出去，非洲的民族解放事业一定要取得最后的胜利。祝第二届亚非人民团结大会对这一斗争做出重大的贡献。”

    “让亚非十七亿人民和妇女更加紧密团结起来，继续发扬万隆精神和和平共处五项原则的精神，高举反对帝国主义和殖民主义的大旗奋勇前进！”
