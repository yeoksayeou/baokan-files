A, B: The General Line, the red flag flutters,
　　The drums of the Great Leap Forward beat the sky,
　　The city vigorously establishes communes,
　　Socialism rises step by step.
　　Catch up with the countryside, surpass the countryside,
　　The city's appearance is completely new,
　　Rural and urban communization,
　　A riot of color is always spring!
A: Beat the bamboo clappers, resounding to the heavens,
　　We came especially to visit.
B: Come to visit, look here,
　　A large area of street factories:
　　Hardware factory, glass factory,
　　Chalk, stationery, toy factory,
　　Spray paint factory, chemical factory,
　　Textile, embroidery, drawnwork factory;
　　The commune has only been established for a little over a year,
　　And twenty factories have been established.
A: Walk around, look in all directions,
　　This place is extraordinary,
　　The hardware factory sign hangs on the door,
　　Entering the gate is a courtyard house.
B: To visit, look in the east room,
　　The commune members are working hard,
　　Chairman Mao's portrait hangs in the center,
　　Leap forward targets are posted all over.
A: Aunts, sit at the table,
　　Homemade machines are placed in front,
　　The hand-cranked machine rattles,
　　Hair clips burst out.
B: In the west room, there are many girls,
　　Each girl does skillful work,
　　Producing iron kettles is effortless,
　　By piecing together a few scraps of iron.
A: In the south room, it's even more tense,
　　Several lathes are humming,
　　Semi-finished products are continuously poured in,
　　Rows of book staples flow down.
B: The south room is good, the north room is good,
　　The commune members in the north room are older sisters,
　　These older sisters are models,
　　Learning to operate the machine in less than a year.
A: Hey, it's strange, it's really strange,
　　Isn't this Auntie Li's second sister,
　　I used to live next door to her,
　　At that time, she was a child bride.
B: She used to be a child bride,
　　Today she is the commune's red banner.
　　When she first came, her body was in the commune but her heart was at home,
　　Only thinking about going home to see the children.
　　After the dining hall and nursery were set up,
　　Auntie Li then wholeheartedly engaged in production.
　　The Party sent her to the factory to study,
　　Returned to the commune to operate the machine.
　　Now, she has completely changed,
　　Her body is at home, but her heart is in the commune.
　　Drilling technology, engaging in creation,
　　Forgetting to eat and sleep.
　　Catching up with the advanced, helping the backward,
　　Became a red banner bearer last year.
　　Spoke at the hero meeting,
　　Chairman Mao smiled at her.
A: Look today, the appearance has changed,
　　Seems to have become younger by several years,
　　Work clothes, worn on the body,
　　The red banner bearer medal hangs on the chest.
　　Energetic and heroic,
　　Truly like the former Mu Guiying!
B: Housewives in the kitchen,
　　Even if there is heat, it cannot radiate light.
A: Housewives enter the factory,
　　Like a bright pearl unearthed.
B: Establishing a factory is not difficult,
　　The problem is the lack of technicians;
　　Found a technician who is not vague,
　　Only knows how to repair tin teapots.
　　The more difficult it is, the more we drill,
　　Technical reform is carried out happily;
　　The commune Party committee comes to support,
　　Large factories come to support together,
　　Semi-finished products are sent for processing,
　　The enthusiasm of the masses is as red as fire.
A: Listen to the past, look at today,
　　Your achievements are not simple.
B: Speaking of which, it's far from enough,
　　Technical reform has just begun,
　　In two years, you look again,
　　Automation must be realized.
A: Beat the bamboo clappers, rattling,
　　Arrive at the big dining hall;
B: Setting up a dining hall is of great significance,
　　The liberation of women depends entirely on it.
A: This dining hall is really beautiful,
　　Snow-white room with glass windows,
　　Colorful paintings hang on the wall,
　　Tables and benches are arranged in rows.
　　Cook, old lady,
　　Covered in white clothes.
B: You look up, look at the blackboard,
　　The dining hall's menu is truly complete:
　　If you want to eat good things, look to the east,
　　A plate of good dishes costs two or three mao;
　　If you want to eat cheap things, look to the west,
　　Take it away for one cent;
　　Buy rice, go here,
　　A bowl of rice costs two cents;
　　Big steamed buns, refined rolls,
　　Corn muffins are all eyes;
　　Many varieties, frequent changes,
　　Living conditions greatly improved every week;
　　Beef buns, Zhajiang noodles,
　　Want to eat dumplings anytime.
A: When there are many people, eating dumplings,
　　How long can they be wrapped?
　　There must be many cooks,
　　At least five cars must be seated.
B: No matter how many people there are, it's still not enough,
　　Dumplings must also be wrapped with a machine.
　　If you don't believe it, look here,
　　The dumpling machine is doing work.
A: See a cook,
　　Steadily operating in front of the machine,
　　Tap water, prepared early,
　　Whole bag of white flour poured in,
　　Also put ginger, also put green onions,
　　Large pieces of pork thrown in.
　　Jijiji, cengcengceng,
　　Dumplings fly out like shooting stars.
　　A thousand dumplings were wrapped,
　　In less than a minute.
B: The public dining hall is most convenient,
　　All arrangements are for production,
　　From morning to night,
　　Selling meals at any time.
　　If the factory is busy,
　　The cook delivers the meal to the site.
　　The meal is hot, the dishes are fragrant,
　　Commune members eat healthier.
A: My ears listen, my eyes see,
　　You have created good experiences.
B: These achievements are nothing,
　　Want to realize dining hall mechanization.
A: Walk forward, look up,
　　There is an old woman Wang at the nursery,
　　The old woman stands in the middle,
　　Children surround her playing hide-and-seek.
B: The nursery has just been established,
　　Children are not used to coming,
　　Crying and shouting to find Mom,
　　Making the old woman helpless.
　　Chasing east, blocking west,
　　Like a flock of lambs not obeying.
　　Today, you look again,
　　Children surround the old woman in circles.
A: The children's little faces are rosy,
　　The children's little legs are thick enough,
　　Mom is happy to see it,
　　The enthusiasm for production is added.
B: Nursery, primary school,
　　Moms don't have to worry,
　　Big and small children have a safe place,
　　We take care of the children's education.
A: Out of the courtyard, walk south,
　　Walk to the temple entrance,
　　A plaque hangs on the temple door,
　　"Answers All Prayers" is written on it.
　　Hey, it's really a new thing,
　　In this day and age, there are still people who pray to gods?
B: Don't misunderstand, you look again,
　　This ancient temple has long been converted into a service station.
　　The telephone rings continuously,
　　A large string of keys on the wall.
A: The service station, the service is good,
　　Thinking about the commune members very thoughtfully,
　　Washing clothes, mending clothes,
　　Lighting the stove, filling water, cleaning the room.
　　You go out, engage in production,
　　Someone takes care of the things at home.
B: The service staff's labor is good,
　　Running around everywhere from morning to night;
　　The service staff's style is high,
　　Willing to break their backs for the commune members.
A: Thousands of threads, ten thousand threads,
　　Each thread牽引 the women,
　　Women have suffered for thousands of years,
　　Now the situation has greatly changed.
B: Untie the threads, cut the threads,
　　Meet on the production front.
A: Old people without children,
　　The service station takes care of them more carefully.
　　If they are sick, someone comes to take care of them,
　　Boiling soup and sending medicine to the bedside.
B: This is the class brothers and sisters' heart to heart,
　　The commune is one family.
A, B: The more we visit, the more we are moved,
　　This is truly a great revolution in the city!
　　Communism is heaven,
　　The people's commune is the bridge,
　　Thank you, leader Chairman Mao!
　　Thank you, wise Communist Party!

    城市公社红旗飘（数来宝）	曲艺月刊编辑部　集体创作甲、乙：总路线，红旗飘，
    大跃进的锣鼓震天敲，
    城市里大力办公社，
    社会主义步步高。
    追乡村，赶乡村，
    城市的面貌一片新，
    乡村城市公社化，
    万紫千红总是春！甲：打竹板，响连天，
    我们特意来参观。乙：来参观，这边看，
    街道工厂一大片：
    五金厂、玻璃厂、
    粉笔、文具、玩具厂，
    喷漆厂、化工厂、
    纺织、刺绣、挑花厂；
    公社成立才一年多，
    工厂办了二十个。甲：一边走，四面望，
    这个地方不寻常，
    五金厂牌子门上挂，
    进大门是座四合房。乙：要参观，东屋里看，
    社员们热火朝天把活干，
    毛主席的像挂当中，
    跃进指标贴了一大片。甲：大娘们，坐桌边，
    土制机器摆面前，
    手摇机器哗啦响，
    头发卡子往外窜。乙：西屋里，姑娘多，
    个个姑娘干巧活，
    生产铁壶不费劲，
    用几片碎铁一凑合。甲：南屋里，更紧张，
    几台车床轰隆隆地响，
    半成品一直往里倒，
    书钉一排排地往下淌。乙：南屋好，北屋好，
    北屋的社员是大嫂，
    这些位大嫂是模范，
    学开机器不到一年。甲：哎，稀奇稀奇真稀奇，
    这不是李家她二姨，
    先前我和她住隔壁，
    那时她是个童养媳。乙：从前她是童养媳，
    今天社里的大红旗。
    刚来时，身在社里心在家，
    光想回家看娃娃。
    办起了食堂托儿站，
    李二姨才一心搞生产。
    党派她工厂去学习，
    回到社里开机器。
    现如今，她倒了一个个儿，
    身在家里心在社。
    钻技术，搞创造，
    忘了吃饭和睡觉。
    赶先进，帮落后，
    去年当上了红旗手。
    群英会上讲了话，
    毛主席笑脸望着她。甲：看今天，模样儿变，
    好像年轻了好几年，
    工作服，身上穿，
    红旗手奖章挂胸前。
    又精神，又英雄，
    真像当年穆桂英！乙：家庭妇女在厨房，
    就是有热也发不出光。甲：家庭妇女进工厂，
    好像明珠出土亮晃晃。乙：办工厂，不困难，
    就是缺乏技术员；
    找了个技术员不含糊，
    光会修理洋铁壶。
    越是困难越是钻，
    技术改革搞得欢；
    公社党委来支持，
    大工厂一齐来支援，
    半成品送来要加工，
    群众干劲火样红。甲：听过去，看今天，
    你们的成绩不简单。乙：说起来，差得远，
    技术改革刚开展，
    过两年，你再看，
    自动化一定要实现。甲：打竹板，哗啦响，
    一来来到大食堂；乙：办食堂，意义大，
    妇女解放全靠它。甲：这食堂，真漂亮，
    雪白的屋子玻璃窗，
    墙上挂着五彩画，
    桌椅板凳排成行。
    炊事员，老大娘，
    身上罩着白衣裳。乙：你抬头，看黑板，
    食堂的菜样真叫全：
    要吃好的东边找，
    一盘好菜两三毛；
    要吃贱的西边有，
    放下一分钱就拿走；
    买米饭，到这边，
    一碗米饭二分钱；
    大馒头，细花卷，
    玉米发糕净是眼；
    花样多，勤变换，
    逢星期生活大改善；
    牛肉包，炸酱面，
    要吃水饺随时办。甲：人多了，吃水饺，
    多少时间能包好？
    炊事员，一定多，
    起码得坐五汽车。乙：人再多，也来不及，
    包饺子也得用机器。
    你不信，这边看，
    饺子机正在把活干。甲：见一位，炊事员，
    稳当当操作机器前，
    自来水，早顺好，
    整袋白面往里倒，
    又放姜，又放葱，
    大块的猪肉往里扔。
    唧唧唧，蹭蹭蹭，
    饺子飞出似流星。
    饺子包了一千整，
    时间不到一分钟。乙：公共食堂最方便，
    一切布置为生产，
    从早晨，到夜间，
    什么时候都卖饭。
    要是工厂正紧张，
    炊事员送饭到现场。
    饭也热，菜也香，
    社员们吃了更健康。甲：我耳朵听，眼睛看，
    你们创造了好经验。乙：这点成绩不算啥，
    要实现食堂机械化。甲：往前走，抬头望，
    托儿站上有位王大娘，
    老大娘站在正当中，
    孩子围着她捉迷藏。乙：托儿站，刚兴办，
    孩子们来到不习惯，
    哭着嚷着要找妈，
    闹得大娘没办法。
    东边追，西边拦，
    如像一群小羊不服管。
    到今天，你再看，
    孩子们围着大娘团团转。甲：孩子们的小脸红扑扑、
    孩子们的小腿都够粗，
    妈妈见了心喜欢，
    生产的劲头往上添。乙：托儿所、小学校，
    妈妈们不用把心操，
    大小孩子有安点，
    孩子的教育我们包。甲：出了院，往南走，
    一走走到庙门口，
    庙门上挂着一块匾，
    “有求必应”写上边。
    哎，真是一件新鲜事，
    这年头还有人求神仙？乙：别误会，你再看，
    这古庙早改成服务站。
    电话铃，响不断，
    墙上钥匙一大串。甲：服务站，服务好，
    给社员想得真周到，
    洗衣裳，补衣裳，
    生炉子、灌水、打扫房。
    你出去，搞生产，
    家里的事情有人管。乙：服务员的劳动好，
    从明到晚到处跑；
    服务员的风格高，
    愿为社员累断腰。甲：千条丝，万条线，
    根根都把妇女牵，
    妇女们苦了几千年，
    如今情况大改变。乙：解开丝，剪断线，
    生产战线上来见面。甲：没儿没女的老年人，
    服务站照顾更细心。
    病了有人来照看，
    煎汤送药到床前。乙：这就是阶级兄弟心连心，
    公社里就是一家人。甲、乙：越参观，越感动，
    这真是城市里的大革命！
    共产主义是天堂，
    人民公社是桥梁，
    感谢领袖毛主席！
    感谢英明的共产党！
