    All Become "First-Class Seedlings"
  　Jin Yu
    Currently, on the agricultural front, we see everywhere the sweeping battle to eliminate third-class seedlings. Wherever third-class seedlings hide, the red flag of encirclement is immediately planted. Weeding, loosening the soil, topdressing fertilizer, fighting drought... never has there been such a vigorous and earth-shattering scene! Commune secretaries are pitching their tents in the fields, personally on the front line. "Resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings!" Third-class seedlings have become the target of public criticism. In order to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1960 and ensure a better and more comprehensive continuous leap forward, we cannot allow "third-class seedlings" to exist.
    A commune Party secretary said it well: "Only with first-class people can there be first-class seedlings." This sentence hits the nail on the head. Indeed, seedlings are cultivated by people, and seedlings are managed by people. What level of people there are, there are the corresponding level of seedlings. With the kind of people who are soaring with drive, third-class seedlings will never be allowed to show their heads. We can move mountains and fill seas, we can repair the earth, we can transform heaven and earth, can't we eliminate third-class seedlings in one fell swoop? Whether we can or not depends first on whether we have established the thinking of "first-class seedlings" and whether we have the drive to eliminate "third-class seedlings." The Party has repeatedly called on us to go all out, strive for the top, and for every revolutionary, that is, to be like seedlings and be "first-class seedlings," be promoters, be vanguard fighters of the proletariat. With the great ambition of communism, with the revolutionary soaring drive, we can achieve: "The task is big, but not as big as our drive; there are many difficulties, but not as many as our methods." Difficulties must bow to us, ideals can become reality, and third-class seedlings can leap to become first-class seedlings.
    "Third-class seedlings" are downstream, are backward, and this is completely incompatible with what our times demand. People must catch up quickly, keep up with the situation, and resolutely become "first-class seedlings." Seedlings are transformed by people, and people are transformed by thought; thought determines action. "Third-class seedlings" must strive to become strong and grow vigorously themselves; everyone should help "third-class seedlings" grow into "first-class seedlings," to topdress, water, and do field management. Our country has ample sunshine, fertile soil, and a warm climate to cultivate first-class seedlings to grow and become strong. It is precisely "first-class seedlings get better and better, second-class seedlings leap again and again, third-class seedlings leap greatly!" Let "third-class seedlings" all become "first-class seedlings!"

    都做“一类苗”
  　金玉
    当前，在农业战线上，到处看到横扫千军的消灭三类苗大战。三类苗躲到哪里，围剿的红旗马上插到那里。锄草、松土、追肥、抗旱……从来没有看到过像这样轰轰烈烈、惊天动地的场面！公社书记都把帐篷扎在田头，亲临第一线。“坚决消灭三类苗！”三类苗成了众矢之的，为了争取1960年农业大丰收、保证更好更全面地持续跃进，我们不能容许“三类苗”存在。
    一位公社党委书记说得好：“有了一类人，才有一类苗”。这句话说得一针见血。的确，苗是人培植出来的，苗是受人管理的，有哪一级人，便有哪一级苗。有了那种干劲冲天的人，三类苗便永远不得露头。我们能移山填海，能修理地球，能改造天地，难道三类苗就不能一举消灭吗？能和不能，首先在于有没有树立“一类苗”的思想，有没有消灭“三类苗”的干劲。党一再号召我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，对于每一个革命者说来，也就是要像禾苗一样做“一类苗”，做促进派、做无产阶级的先锋战士。有了共产主义的雄心大志，有了革命的冲天干劲，便能做到：“任务大，没有我们的干劲大；困难多，没有我们的办法多”。困难都要向我们低头，理想都可以成为现实，三类苗都可以跃为一类苗。
    “三类苗”，是下游，是落后，这和我们的时代所要求的完全不相称。人们都要急起直追，跟上形势，坚决做“一类苗”。苗是靠人改造，人是靠思想改造，思想决定行动。“三类苗”要自己发奋图强，茁长壮大；所有的人都应该去帮助“三类苗”成长为“一类苗”，要追肥，浇水，做田间管理。我们的国家有充足的阳光，肥沃的土壤，温暖的气候，可以培养一类苗生长壮大。正是“一类苗好上加好，二类苗一跃再跃，三类苗大跳特跳！”让“三类苗”都成为“一类苗”吧。
