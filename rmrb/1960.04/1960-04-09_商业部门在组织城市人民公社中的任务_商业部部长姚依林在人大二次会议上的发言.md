Comrades Deputies:
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the issue of organizing the people's economic life in the work of establishing urban people's communes.
    Currently, cities across the country are organizing urban people's communes. Organizing the people's economic life is an important aspect of this work. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, urban industrial production and construction have greatly developed, and urban street industries serving large-scale industry have also developed rapidly, all of which require the addition of a large amount of labor. In order to tap the labor potential of cities and organize housewives to participate in social production, achieving "no idle person in every family, everyone has something to do," it is necessary to further organize the economic life of urban people, realize the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. Organizing the people's economic life is an urgent requirement for the further development of urban industrial production and a social transformation inevitably caused by the further development of social production methods in our country.
    
    What are the tasks of the commercial sector?
    
    Organizing the economic life of urban people is a task for the entire Party and all the people under the unified leadership of the Party committee. It requires close collaboration from all relevant parties to widely mobilize and organize the masses, take initiative, and create their new lives. The commercial sector originally undertakes the tasks of serving production and serving the people's livelihood, and is a bridge between production and production, and between production and consumption. Its business activities are closely related to the people's lives. Therefore, in the work of organizing urban people's communes, especially in organizing the economic life of urban people, the commercial sector should become a strong assistant to Party committees at all levels. According to existing preliminary experience, the commercial sector should mainly do the following three aspects of work under the unified leadership of the Party committee in organizing the economic life of urban people: First, help the masses establish public canteens and nurseries. Solving the problems of people's meals and childcare is the central link in liberating women from housework. According to statistics from early March, in addition to the existing public canteens in institutions, troops, factories, and schools, major and medium-sized cities across the country have organized 53,000 street public canteens, with more than 5.1 million people joining in; more than 50,000 nurseries have been organized, taking care of more than 1.46 million children. The commercial sector has played a considerable role in establishing these organizations. Second, organize the masses to establish various life service undertakings such as laundry, sewing, repair, hairdressing, bathing, cleaning and sanitation, and caring for the sick and elderly, so as to relieve people of the burden of daily housework and enable them to free up more time for production, study, and rest. According to statistics from early March, major and medium-sized cities across the country have organized more than 55,000 street service stations, with more than 450,000 service personnel. Third, organize the masses to rationally distribute commodities, and in accordance with the principle of "overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, ensuring key points, taking care of necessities, and arranging general items", conduct reasonable distribution of some non-staple foods and daily necessities through mass discussions and relying on resident agency stores and service stations to better meet people's consumption needs. According to the statistics of the Shangxin Street Comprehensive Store in Chongqing, the commodities distributed through the masses account for about one-third of the total commodities sold by the store.
    Experience has shown that in places where urban people's communes have been established, and in places where the above aspects of work have been done relatively well, the living conditions and mental outlook of the people have undergone major changes, and the enthusiasm for production has been further increased. When people step out of the narrow family circle and participate in collective life, receive education in collectivist thought, the communist style will gradually improve, and new social customs of close unity, mutual assistance, sharing weal and woe, and kinship will be further established. Production and life are inextricably linked. What kind of production method requires what kind of lifestyle. The socialist collectivization of production urgently requires the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. As long as our lifestyle adapts to the mode of production, it will inevitably further inspire people's revolutionary enthusiasm and further promote the development of productive forces.
    
    Transforming people's scattered and trivial housework into a socialist large economy is the direction of our efforts. As long as the people's economic life is organized and housework socialization is realized, it can open up broad prospects for the widespread development of technological innovation and technological revolution, and for the gradual realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Chairman Mao once said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Only when China has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in terms of social and economic system, and has used machines in all departments and places where machines can be used, can the social and economic outlook be completely changed." We believe that Chairman Mao's instruction applies not only to production and construction, but also to life and welfare. Organizing the people's economic life and liberating a large number of women to participate in social production is a revolution; on the basis of organization, transforming the original manual operation into mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and liberating more labor force is another revolution. Recently, Tianjin City created a semi-automatic窝头 (wōtóu, a type of cornbread) machine. What is put in is corn kernels, and what comes out is hot 窝头. One machine only requires one person to operate, and it can produce more than 5,000 窝头 per hour, which is more than 100 times more efficient than manual operation. The dumpling-making machine produced by the Harbin Commercial Machinery Factory is fully mechanized and semi-automated from kneading dough, mixing meat, mixing fillings, pressing skins to making dumplings. It can make more than 8,000 dumplings per hour, and the dumplings made are almost the same as handmade dumplings. May I ask, can such a machine be used on the basis of scattered individual housework? Obviously impossible. Only by organizing housework can it be possible to use machine operation on a large scale, and it is possible to establish staple food processing plants in different regions to supply the needs of staple foods for dozens of canteens in the surrounding area. Not only can cooking be mechanized and semi-mechanized, but also laundry, making cloth shoes, cleaning, etc., can also be mechanized and semi-mechanized. With manual shoe soles, one person can only make one and a half pairs a day. If the shoe sole machine recently made in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, is used, only one person is needed to operate, and more than 100 pairs of shoe soles can be made a day, and the efficiency is increased by more than 70 times. We once calculated an account. The people of the whole country wear about 1.5 billion pairs of cloth shoes every year. If they are all made by hand, 8.1 million people will have to make shoes; if all the machines are used, only 1 million people will be needed, which can save 7 million people to engage in other aspects of labor. Isn't this a big deal? Of course, it will take a long time to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of housework. We should accelerate the process of mechanization and semi-mechanization as much as possible on the basis of organization. Under the current circumstances, we should use foreign methods if possible, semi-foreign methods if foreign methods are not possible, and native methods if semi-foreign methods are not possible, and use both foreign and native methods to advance rapidly.
    
    In addition to running public canteens and collective life service undertakings well, rational distribution of commodities is also an important aspect of organizing people's economic life. Rational distribution of commodities should be carried out through the masses and relying on the masses. First of all, it is necessary to carefully understand the basic consumption of residents through street residents' committees, mass-run agency stores, service stations, etc., establish "economic accounts," and be familiar with the number of households, population, income level, living habits, whether they are southerners or northerners, whether there are elderly people and children, whether there are lying-in women and patients, and so on. Then, discuss with the masses the reasonable distribution methods for certain commodities that need to be distributed, and rely on the masses to carry out distribution. At this stage, rational distribution of commodities is still based on equal-value exchange and distributed according to people's different needs. It is essentially different from the communist nature of distribution according to needs, but it is a further development of the socialist commodity distribution form. By adopting this method, the commodity distribution work can be done more and more meticulously, the commercial sector can further accurately count the consumption needs of the vast number of residents, and better serve the people.
    
    Answering two questions that some people are worried about
    
    Some people are worried, can public canteens make a variety of dishes to suit the tastes of different people? Is it possible to eat better, save more money, and be more convenient than eating at home? Some people are also worried, if the method of reasonable distribution is adopted for certain commodities, is there still freedom of choice? We believe that these problems can be solved. Public canteens can greatly save manpower, save food, save coal, save water and electricity, and gradually realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Therefore, public canteens have the conditions to save a lot more than cooking one household at a time. Public canteens can specially train catering staff, improve cooking skills, learn health and nutrition knowledge, and can gradually add various cooking equipment and disinfection equipment such as frying, stir-frying, cooking, deep-frying, baking, and roasting according to needs, and can grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens according to conditions, and gradually establish non-staple food production bases. Therefore, public canteens have the possibility to make a variety of dishes to suit different tastes, and are nutritious, clean, and hygienic. In fact, many public canteens in institutions, troops, factories, and schools have been run very well, and some street public canteens have also been run very well. Of course, some public canteens have not been run very well because they have not been opened for a long time, lack experience, and have simple equipment. We believe that as long as politics is in command, leadership is strengthened, and advanced experience is actively promoted, it can be gradually improved. In order to facilitate the masses, some public canteens have adopted flexible and diverse service methods: they can join the whole伙 (huǒ, unit for meals), or half 伙, or holiday 伙; they can buy staple food alone, or non-staple food alone; they can eat in the canteen, or take it home to eat; for patients and the elderly, they can also deliver meals to their homes. These methods can be promoted. As for the rational distribution of certain commodities, it does not exclude people's freedom of choice within a certain range. We believe that people's needs for food such as grain, vegetables, meat, sugar, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, etc., and daily necessities such as matches and soap are always similar. As long as we earnestly follow the mass line and do a good job in distribution, we can adapt to people's needs. Moreover, while we are working hard to run public canteens and mass life service industries well, we not only do not cancel the existing state-owned professional stores, restaurants, and life service undertakings, but also should run them more and better. That is to say, there must be mass agency stores and state-owned professional stores; there must be mass-run public canteens and state-owned restaurants; there must be mass-run life service undertakings and state-owned service industries. With state-owned as the center and the masses as the foundation, walking on two legs. In this way, people's lives can be made more convenient and more colorful. In addition, it should also be noted that in organizing the people's economic life, the principle of "active leadership and voluntary participation" should be adopted. For those few people who are temporarily unwilling to participate or are temporarily unable to participate, do not force them to participate, and allow them to live one household at a time. In terms of non-staple food supply, not only should priority be given to the needs of the collective, but also the needs of people who have not yet joined the public canteens should be appropriately taken care of.
    
    While organizing the economic life of urban people, the commercial sector should also actively help and promote the development of urban people's commune industry and urban street industrial production. Help them formulate production plans, find production methods, add production equipment, improve production technology, supply raw materials, actively purchase products, and organize material exchanges. In addition, the commercial sector should also actively participate in organizing the people's political life and cultural life, and combine the organization of the people's economic life with the organization of the people's political life and cultural life.
    
    In industrial and mining areas, forest areas and rural areas
    
    The commercial sector should not only actively organize the economic life of urban people, but also actively participate in organizing the economic life of people in industrial and mining areas, forest areas and vast rural areas. In industrial and mining areas and forest areas, we should actively help factories and mines do a good job in workers' lives, and promote the high-speed development of factory and mining production and forestry production in many ways. In the vast rural areas, the primary task in organizing the people's economic life at present is to actively assist the grain departments in running rural public canteens well under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Help rural public canteens train catering staff, improve cooking techniques, innovate operating tools, improve labor efficiency, and establish management systems. At the same time, we should set up commercial networks with rural public canteens as the center, organize various mass life service undertakings such as sewing, repairing, hairdressing, and bathing, and assist relevant departments in establishing cultural service undertakings such as clubs, libraries, and health centers. So that the daily needs of the members can be solved at any time, saving time and facilitating the masses. Make rural public canteens the center of the masses' political life, economic life and cultural life.
    
    For the commercial sector itself, participating in organizing the people's economic life will further improve the level of commercial work. Commercial work is not only an economic work, but also a political work and a mass work. We must treat economic work as a political work and a mass work, so that commercial work can take root deeply among the broad masses of the people. Chairman Mao said in the article "Concern for the Life of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "Solving the masses' problems of clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, salt, disease and hygiene, and marriage. In short, all the practical life problems of the masses are issues that we should pay attention to." Of course, the ideological level and work level of commercial staff across the country are still not high, and the achievements we have made are still far from the requirements of the Party and the people of the whole country, and there are many shortcomings in the work, but we are determined to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, we will surely be able to do our work better.
    
    Please correct the above opinions.

### 商业部门在组织城市人民公社中的任务  商业部部长姚依林在人大二次会议上的发言

    商业部门在组织城市人民公社中的任务
    商业部部长姚依林在人大二次会议上的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理的报告。现在我就建立城市人民公社的工作中，有关组织人民经济生活的问题，发表一些意见。
    目前全国各城市正在组织城市人民公社。在组织城市人民公社的工作中，组织人民经济生活是一个重要的方面。自从1958年大跃进以来，城市工业生产和建设事业有了很大的发展，为大工业服务的城市街道工业也在迅速发展，都需要补充大量的劳动力。为了挖掘城市的劳动潜力，组织家庭妇女参加社会生产，做到“家家无闲人，人人有事做”，就必须把城市人民的经济生活进一步组织起来，实现家务劳动社会化和生活集体化。组织人民经济生活，是进一步发展城市工业生产的迫切要求，是我国社会生产方式进一步发展中必然引起的社会生活方式的变革。
    商业部门的任务是什么
    组织城市人民的经济生活，是在党委统一领导下的一个全党、全民的工作，需要组织一切有关方面密切协作，把人民群众广泛地发动起来和组织起来，自己动手，创造自己的新生活。商业部门本来就担负着为生产服务、为人民生活服务的任务，是生产与生产之间、生产与消费之间的桥梁，它的业务活动同人民生活有十分密切的关系，因此，在组织城市人民公社的工作中，特别是在组织城市人民经济生活方面，商业部门应当成为各级党委的有力助手。根据现有的初步经验，商业部门在组织城市人民经济生活方面，主要是在党委统一领导下协同有关部门做好以下三个方面的工作：第一、帮助群众兴办公共食堂和托儿所。解决人们吃饭和带孩子的问题，这是把妇女从家务劳动中解放出来的中心环节。据3月上旬的统计，全国各大城市和中等城市，除了机关、部队、工厂、学校等原有的公共食堂以外，已经组织了街道公共食堂五万三千个，入伙人数五百一十万余人；已经组织了托儿所五万多个，收托儿童一百四十六万余人。商业部门在建立这些组织中发挥了相当的作用。第二、组织群众兴办洗衣、缝补、修理、理发、洗澡、清洁卫生、照顾病人老人等各种生活服务事业，解除人们日常家务琐事的牵累，使人们能够腾出更多的时间从事生产、学习和休息。据3月上旬的统计，全国各大城市和中等城市，已经组织了各种街道服务站五万五千多个，服务人员四十五万余人。第三、组织群众合理分配商品，按照“统筹兼顾、保证重点、照顾必需、安排一般”的原则，通过群众讨论，依靠居民代销店和服务站，对一部分副食品和日常生活用品，进行合理分配，更好地满足人们的消费需要。根据重庆市上新街综合商店的统计，通过群众分配的商品，大约占这个商店销售的全部商品的三分之一。
    经验证明，凡是成立了城市人民公社的地方，凡是以上几方面的工作做得比较好的地方，人们的生活情况和精神面貌都发生了重大的变化，生产积极性也进一步高涨起来。当人们走出了狭小的家庭圈子，参加到集体生活里面，受了集体主义思想的教育，共产主义风格就会逐步提高，亲密团结，互相帮助，休戚相关，情同骨肉的社会新风尚就会进一步树立起来。生产和生活有着不可分割的关系，有什么样的生产方式，就要求有什么样的生活方式。社会主义的生产集体化，迫切地要求家务劳动社会化和生活集体化。只要我们的生活方式与生产方式相适应，就必然会进一步鼓舞人们的革命干劲，进一步促进生产力的发展。
    把人们分散的、琐碎的家务劳动，普遍地改造成为社会主义的大经济，这是我们努力的方向。只要把人民的经济生活组织起来，实现家务劳动社会化，就可以为广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命，为逐步实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化开辟广阔的前途。毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”中曾经说过：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观”。我们认为，毛主席的这个指示，不仅适用于生产建设方面，而且同样适用于生活福利方面。把人民的经济生活组织起来，解放一大批妇女参加社会生产，这是一次革命；在组织起来的基础上，把原来的手工操作改造成为机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，解放更多的劳动力，这又是一次革命。最近天津市创造的一部半自动化的窝头机，放进去的是玉米粒，出来的是热窝窝头，一部机器只要一个人操作，一小时能生产五千来个窝窝头，比手工操作效率提高了一百多倍。哈尔滨市商业机械厂生产的包饺子机器，由和面、搅肉、拌馅、压皮到出饺子全部机械化和半自动化，每小时可以包饺子八千来个，包出来的饺子同手工包的饺子差不多。试问，在分散的个体的家务劳动的基础上，能够采用这样的机器吗？显然是不可能的。只有把家务劳动组织起来，才有可能大量地采用机器操作，才有可能分地区建立主食品加工厂，供应周围几十个食堂主食品的需要。不仅在做饭方面可以机械化、半机械化，而且在洗衣服、做布鞋、清洁卫生等等方面，也可以机械化、半机械化。用手工纳鞋底，一个人一天只能纳一双半，如果采用河北省邢台市最近制成的纳鞋底机器，只要一个人操作，一天就能纳一百多双鞋底，效率提高了七十多倍。我们曾经算过一笔账。全国人民每年要穿布鞋约十五亿双，如果都用手工做，要有八百一十万人专门做鞋；如果全部改用机器，只要一百万人就行了，可以节省出七百万人从事其他方面的劳动，难道说这不是一件大事吗？当然，要做到使家务劳动机械化、半机械化，还需要一段较长的时间。我们应当在组织起来的基础上，尽可能加速机械化、半机械化的过程。在目前的情况下，应当是能洋就洋，不能洋就半洋，不能半洋就采用土法，洋土并举，迅速前进。
    除了办好公共食堂、办好集体的生活服务事业以外，合理分配商品，也是组织人民经济生活的一个重要方面。合理分配商品，应当通过群众、依靠群众来进行。首先是要通过街道居民委员会、群众自办的代销店、服务站等，细致地了解居民消费的基本情况，建立“经济户口”，做到熟知户数、人口、收入水平、生活习惯，是南方人还是北方人，有没有老人、小孩，有没有产妇、病人等等。然后对某些需要进行分配的商品，和群众商量合理分配的办法，依靠群众，进行分配。在现阶段，合理分配商品，还是在等价交换的基础上按照人们的不同需要进行分配，它与共产主义性质的按需分配还有本质的区别，但是，它已经是社会主义商品分配形式的进一步发展。采取了这种办法，就可以使商品分配工作愈做愈细致，可以使商业部门把广大居民的消费需要进一步统计清楚，更好地为人民服务。
    回答有人耽心的两个问题
    有些人耽心，在公共食堂吃饭，是不是能够做到饭菜多种多样，适合不同人们的口味？是不是能够比在家里吃饭吃得更好更省，更加方便？还有些人耽心，对某些商品采取合理分配的办法，是不是还有选择的自由？我们认为，这些问题是可以解决的。公共食堂做饭可以大大节约人力，可以节约粮食、节约煤炭、节约水电，可以逐步实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，因此，公共食堂就有条件做到比一家一户做饭省得多。公共食堂可以专门训练炊事人员，提高烹饪技术，学习卫生营养知识，可以根据需要逐步增添煎、炒、烹、炸、烘、烤等各种炊事设备和消毒设备，可以根据条件种菜、养猪、养鸡，逐步建立副食品生产基地，因此，公共食堂就有可能把饭菜做得多种多样，适合不同口味，而且营养丰富，干净卫生。事实上现在不少机关、部队、工厂、学校的公共食堂已经办得很好，有些街道公共食堂也办得很好。当然，还有一些公共食堂，由于开办不久，经验不够，设备简陋，还办得不算好。我们相信，只要政治挂帅，加强领导，积极推广先进经验，是可以逐步办好的。为了方便群众，有些公共食堂采取了灵活多样的服务方式：可以入整伙，也可以入半伙、假日伙；可以单买主食，也可以单买副食；可以在食堂吃，也可以打回家吃；对于病人、老人还可以把饭菜送到家中，这些方法都是可以推广的。至于对某些商品进行合理分配，并不排除人们在一定范围内的选择自由。我们认为，在粮食、蔬菜、肉类、食糖、油盐酱醋等食品，火柴、肥皂等日用品方面，人们的需要总是大同小异的，只要认真地走群众路线，做好分配工作，就可以适应人们的需要。何况，我们在努力办好公共食堂和群众性的生活服务行业的同时，不仅不取消现有的国营专业商店、饭馆和生活服务事业，而且还应当把它们办得更多更好。这就是说，既要有群众代销店，又要有国营专业商店；既要有群众自办的公共食堂，又要有国营的饭馆、餐厅；既要有群众自办的生活服务事业，又要有国营的服务行业。以国营为中心，以群众为基础，两条腿走路。这样，就可以使人民的生活更加方便，更加丰富多彩。此外，还需要说明的是，在组织人民经济生活的时候，应当采取“积极领导、自愿参加”的原则。对于那些少数暂时还不愿意参加或者暂时还不可能参加的人，不要勉强他们参加，可以容许他们一家一户地过生活。在副食品供应上，不仅应当优先照顾集体的需要，而且应当适当地照顾还没有参加公共食堂的人们的需要。
    商业部门在组织城市人民经济生活的同时，还要积极帮助和促进城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业生产的发展。帮助他们制订生产规划，寻找生产门路，增添生产设备，改进生产技术，供应原料材料，积极收购产品，组织物资交流。此外，商业部门还应当积极参与组织人民的政治生活和文化生活的工作，把组织人民的经济生活，和组织人民的政治生活、文化生活结合起来。
    在工矿区、林区和农村
    商业部门不仅应当积极组织城市人民的经济生活，而且应当在工矿区、林区和广大农村积极参与组织人民经济生活的工作。在工矿区和林区，应当积极帮助厂矿搞好工人生活，从多方面促进厂矿生产和林业生产的高速度发展。在广大农村，当前在组织人民经济生活方面的首要任务，是在党委的统一领导下，积极协助粮食部门办好农村公共食堂。帮助农村公共食堂培训炊事人员，改进烹调技术，革新操作工具，提高劳动效率，建立管理制度。同时，还要以农村公共食堂为中心，设置商业网，组织缝纫、修补、理发、洗澡等各项群众性的生活服务事业，协助有关部门建立俱乐部、图书馆、卫生所等文化服务事业。使社员日常生活的需要能够随时得到解决，既节省时间，又便利群众。使农村公共食堂成为群众的政治生活、经济生活和文化生活的中心。
    对商业部门本身来说，参与组织人民经济生活，将会进一步提高商业工作的水平。商业工作不仅是一项经济工作，而且是政治工作和群众工作，要把经济工作当作政治工作、群众工作来做，使商业工作在广大的人民群众中间深深地扎下根去。毛主席在“关心群众生活、注意工作方法”一文中说过：“解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，柴米油盐问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”当然，目前全国商业工作人员的思想水平和工作水平还不高，我们所取得的成绩距离党和全国人民对我们的要求还很远，工作中的缺点还很多，但是我们决心按照毛主席指示的方向去做。我们深信，在党的领导下，在全国人民的支持下，我们一定能够把工作进一步做好。
    以上意见请各位代表指正。
