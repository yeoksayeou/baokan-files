Just Like An Advanced Pace-setter
Wang Pu

The broad masses of workers in Chongqing Municipality, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, launched the "Just Like" movement, and were determined to learn from the advanced levels and advanced figures of the same type of work, the same business, and the same type of equipment in the country, the province, the city, and the factories and mines, so as to be just like the advanced pace-setters. The broad masses of workers in Yangquan and Taiyuan cities in Shanxi Province also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee and marched towards advanced indicators, determined to catch up with the advanced levels of the whole country, the whole province, and the whole special zone. Although the time has been very short, the effect has been very great. Batches of backward units have become advanced units, and batches of backward people have become advanced people, truly achieving just like advanced pace-setters.

Advanced pace-setters are the red flags for implementing the general line, and are the pioneers in promoting the high-speed development of social productive forces and the progress of science and technology. The broad masses of workers are striving to catch up with them, to be just like them. This fact shows that the thoughts and deeds of those decadent cowards and lazy people have been despised by the broad masses of workers; the combat style of communists has become the code of conduct for the broad masses of workers. The days are not far off when China, which possesses a quarter of the world's population, will catch up with the major capitalist countries in terms of economy, culture, and science.

The reason why advanced pace-setters have become red flags for implementing the general line is not because they possess any unique conditions, but because they have established the lofty aspirations of the working class and have a red heart that wholeheartedly serves the people and is loyal to the noble cause of socialism and communism. With the spirit of continuous revolution and soaring drive, they are giving play to the infinite wisdom and unyielding perseverance of the proletariat, constantly breaking the shackles of old ideas, old technologies, and old habits, and constantly creating new technologies, new methods, new habits, and new production levels, opening up roads for the development of social productive forces and the progress of science and technology. To learn from them, catch up with them, and be just like them, we must first of all be just like them in wholeheartedly serving the people, just like them in being loyal to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, just like them in daring to abandon all old things, and just like them in daring to create new things. If our thinking is red and our drive is sufficient, then our innovation will be red and our production will be red. If our thinking and drive are just like those of advanced pace-setters, we will definitely be able to create production results that are just like those of advanced pace-setters. Backwardness will then be transformed into advancement.

That blue comes from indigo but is bluer than indigo, and that the latecomer surpasses the former is the law of the development of things. New experiences and new technologies can not only be learned but also developed; advanced levels can not only be caught up with but also surpassed. We must have such ambition, be determined to be just like advanced pace-setters, and surpass them, to be unlike them. Advanced pace-setters should have a noble communist style; on the one hand, they should not be complacent, and they should advance further even when they are advanced; on the other hand, they should help the backward without reservation. It is an excellent thing if others catch up with them. At that time, they themselves can also have a "just like advanced pace-setters" and a "latecomer surpasses the former." When the vanguard breaks through an opening, the army follows. You chase me and I chase you, you help me learn and I help you, and this cycle continues endlessly, with one wave following another, and each wave higher than the last, the entire social production level can be rapidly and continuously improved.

There is a folk song that says it well: "No matter how deep the river, it has a bottom; there is no bottom to breaking superstition. No matter how wide the sea, it has a shore; there is no limit to liberating thought. No matter how high the mountain, it has a peak; there is no peak to production development. No matter how long the river, it has a source; there is no end to advancement." To be just like advanced pace-setters is to forever break superstition, forever liberate thought, forever summon up drive, strive for the upper reaches, and persist in continuous revolution.

### 跟先进标兵一个样

    跟先进标兵一个样
    王朴
    重庆市广大职工在技术革新、技术革命运动中，热烈响应市委的号召，开展了“一个样”运动，立志向全国的、全省的、全市的和厂矿企业内的同工种、同业务、同类型设备的先进水平、先进人物学习，做到和先进标兵一个样。山西阳泉、太原市的广大职工，也热烈响应市委的号召，向先进指标进军，立志赶上全国的或全省的、全专区的先进水平。时间虽然都很短，效果却都很大。成批的后进单位变为先进单位，成批的后进人物变为先进人物，真正做到了跟先进标兵一个样。
    先进标兵是执行总路线的红旗，是推动社会生产力高速度发展和科学技术进步的先驱。广大职工群众奋发起来，努力赶上他们，要跟他们一个样。这个事实说明，那些萎靡不振的懦夫和懒汉的思想言行，已经为广大职工群众所鄙弃；共产主义者的战斗风格，已经成为广大职工群众的行动准则。拥有全世界四分之一人口的中国，在经济上、文化上、科学上赶上资本主义大国的日子，为时不远了。
    先进标兵之所以成为执行总路线的红旗，并不是由于他们拥有什么得天独厚的条件，而是由于他们树立了工人阶级的雄心大志，有一颗全心全意为人民服务，忠于社会主义和共产主义崇高事业的红心。他们以不断革命的精神和冲天的干劲，发挥着无产阶级的无穷智慧和坚韧不拔的毅力，不断打破旧思想、旧技术、旧习惯的束缚，不断创造新技术、新方法、新习惯和新的生产水平，为社会生产力的发展，为科学技术的进步开辟道路。要学他们，赶他们，跟他们一个样，首先就得跟他们一个样地全心全意为人民服务，跟他们一个样地忠于无产阶级的革命事业，跟他们一个样地勇于抛弃一切旧事物，跟他们一个样地敢于创造新事物。思想红、干劲足，就能革新红、生产红。思想和干劲跟先进标兵一个样，就一定能够创造出跟先进标兵一个样的生产成绩。落后也就完成了向先进的转化。
    青出于蓝而胜于蓝，后来者居上，这是事物发展的规律。新经验、新技术不仅可以学习，还可以发展；先进水平不仅可以赶上，还可以超过。我们要有这样的雄心，立志跟先进标兵一个样，又超过他们，跟他们不一个样。先进标兵要有高尚的共产主义风格，一方面不要自满，先进再先进，更上一层楼；另一方面见后进就帮，毫无保留。别人赶到自己前头去了，这是极好的事情。那时候，自己也同样可以来一个“跟先进标兵一个样”，同样来一个“后来者居上”。尖兵突破一个口，千军万马跟上来。你追我赶，你赶我追，你帮我学，你学我帮，如此循环不已，一波未平，一波又起，后浪推前浪，一浪高过一浪，整个社会生产水平就可以迅速地不断地提高了。
    有一首民歌讲得好：“江再深，也有底，破除迷信没有底。海再宽，也有边，解放思想没有边。山再高，也有顶，生产发展没有顶。河再长，也有头，先进永远没有头。”要跟先进标兵一个样，就是永远破除迷信，永远解放思想，永远鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚持不断革命。
