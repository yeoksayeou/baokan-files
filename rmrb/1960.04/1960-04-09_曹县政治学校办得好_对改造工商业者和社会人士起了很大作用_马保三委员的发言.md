Speech by Committee Member Ma Baosan:

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Like all provinces across the country, Shandong Province's CPPCC work, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Provincial Party Committee, and under the radiant illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, has made great progress in the past year. Especially since the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to consultations on major issues, and in order to promote people from all walks of life to study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and actively participate in the new upsurge of the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, it has held many experience exchange meetings, report meetings, on-site meetings, and thematic lectures, and organized seven visits and study tours. Through these activities, it has been of great benefit to promoting people from all walks of life to serve and transform themselves better. In addition, the provincial, municipal, and county CPPCCs have also made some achievements in organizing and promoting people from all walks of life, industrialists, businessmen, intellectuals, and social figures to participate in labor training.

According to the needs of the development of the situation and the learning requirements of people from all walks of life, political schools at all levels have also undergone new development, and some have created very good experiences. Now I would like to report to the conference on the situation of the political school in Cao County.

Through study, most students have made significant progress politically, while also improving their cultural level and learning production techniques.

The political school in Cao County has been run for two terms, each lasting three months, and the third term is currently underway. The students in the first and second terms were all industrialists and businessmen, and the third term, in addition to industrialists and businessmen, also absorbed some old intellectuals and social figures scattered in the countryside. After studying, most students have made relatively obvious progress. From their own experience, they understand that continuing to study and transform themselves in labor production and practice is beneficial to them. The understanding of “Long Live” has also been significantly improved compared to before the study. More than one-third of the 213 people in the first and second terms (40 people) were rated as advanced workers. At the same time, they studied culture, supplemented their primary and junior high school Chinese and mathematics, and 45 people removed the label of illiteracy. This school also solved the production and living problems of some family members of industrialists and businessmen. Organizing family members to raise poultry and engage in handicrafts, in January of this year alone, each person's average income reached 17 yuan. From April to August 1959, the income from grass cutting alone by family members reached 1,500 yuan. Now 251 households have increased their income and improved their lives due to the participation of family members in production. This school started from scratch and now has a large-scale breeding farm and horticultural farm. Last year, they accumulated 1.2 million jin of fertilizer, supplied 450,000 jin of vegetables to the market, and transferred more than 150 pigs and sheep. Moreover, they also engaged in a number of innovations and creations. Relevant units have requested to send private personnel, old intellectuals, and social figures from their units to study. After studying, the students believe that "studying for three months is better than reading for ten years." In each term, some people actively request to stay at the school to continue learning production techniques, and some are willing to stay at the school for a long time to participate in labor production. This school has well implemented the Party's policies and truly achieved the satisfaction of the leadership, relevant departments, and students. How did they run this school?

Politics in Command, Running the School Diligently and Frugally, Starting from Scratch

1. Politics in command, running the school diligently and frugally, starting from scratch. The school site was originally a barren and infertile "disorderly burial ground." Starting from production, there was no investment, no houses, so they first built thatched sheds; no classrooms, so they held classes in the open air; no teachers, so they were taken by responsible comrades from the United Front Work Department and relevant departments. In this way, under the illumination of the General Line, from nothing to something, from small to large, in a short period of one year, they have built 29 school buildings, 280 livestock sheds, opened up 96 mu of horticulture, raised 357 pigs, 28 cattle, 2 horses, 2 donkeys, 742 sheep, 62 guinea pigs, 800 chickens and ducks, 108 boxes of bees, and more than 40,000 fish fry. The daily output of tofu is 1,000 jin. In addition, they have also established iron and wood workshops for technological innovation. Now the total output value of the school has reached more than 100,000 yuan. This is how the school was run, and its scale is growing day by day.

Open Thinking, Linking with Reality, Free Debate

2. The school's production is certainly very good, but the main task is still learning. They conscientiously implemented the principle of political and ideological leadership, with labor practice as the foundation. Conscientiously implement positive education and gentle breezes and drizzles. After entering the school, they immediately announced the policies, did not label people, opened their minds, linked with reality, and based on the problems raised, let them collect materials and debate freely. In order to help them distinguish right from wrong and improve their understanding, in addition to their own discussions, they adopted three methods: inviting responsible comrades from relevant departments to make reports; inviting worker-peasant labor models to make reports; and visiting and studying. The reports of responsible comrades are comprehensive in addressing issues, and the principles and policies are clear. Because they participated in labor, they became interested in the reports of worker-peasant labor models. Looking at others and comparing themselves, most people have a sense of "being ashamed of their inferiority." Then organize visits and studies according to needs, especially organizing active elements among the working people to hold forums during the visits, and also allowing them to visit freely. The combination of these three yields good results.

Combination of Political Study, Labor, and Technical Revolution

3. The combination of political study, labor production, and technical revolution. In addition to political study and participation in labor, students also vigorously engage in technical revolution and technical innovation. The school has a technical innovation committee, and each class has a technical innovation team. In addition to having learning class leaders and team leaders, each class and team also has production technology class leaders and team leaders. Under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward situation, an atmosphere of everyone engaging in innovation and creation has also formed within the school. Now 37 technological innovations have been successfully researched, such as feed crushers, chaff cutters, automatic waterwheels, etc. Through participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, their learning and labor enthusiasm has been greatly helped. Gradually guiding them to realize that the world can be known and the world can be changed, so that they realize the importance of first transforming the subjective world in order to change the objective world, and promoting their consciousness of self-education and self-transformation. This is one of the effective methods to inspire them to change their old world outlook.

County Party Committee Strengthens Leadership, United Front Work Department and County CPPCC Take the Initiative to Cooperate

4. Why can this school be run so successfully?

The most fundamental problem is the county party committee's emphasis and strengthening of leadership. Among the 830,000 people in Cao County, there are 8,000 people from all walks of life belonging to the bourgeoisie, including 3,500 in the industrial and commercial sector (including 32 capitalists, 1,300 small business owners, and 2,168 small vendors), 1,100 in the cultural and educational sector, 400 in the health sector, and 3,000 social figures (including religion). After the previous political movements and self-transformation, especially after the 1957 rectification and anti-rightist campaign, they have made great progress, but their political ideology and world outlook still need to be continuously transformed, and most of them can be transformed; after transformation, they can better serve socialist construction. The Cao County Party Committee believes that transforming all those who can be transformed is the responsibility of the Party. The County Party Committee has strengthened its leadership in this regard, instructing relevant departments to work together to seize the opportunity, focus on the center, carry out mass movements, and run political schools well.

Secondly, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the United Front Work Department and the County CPPCC actively cooperate with relevant departments. In this collaboration, the United Front Work Department and the County CPPCC first serve the relevant departments, such as helping the commercial sector organize surplus personnel for production. Some family members of industrialists and businessmen did not participate in production, causing some difficulties for the families of industrialists and businessmen, so the political school organized them to engage in various handicrafts and sideline production. Because the political school vigorously engages in horticulture and breeding, it has helped to supplement the supply of vegetables and meat in the county town, and at the same time helped the communes to engage in technical innovation, etc. Therefore, all parties are satisfied, and all parties give the school strong support. The school does not have teachers, and responsible comrades from various units go to give lectures. If the school has any difficulties, all parties try to help. The close cooperation of relevant departments is also an important condition for running the political school well.

5. In order to "mobilize all forces that can be mobilized and transform all people who can be transformed," they plan to take the county political school as the center and run amateur political schools on a large scale. Communes are also preparing to run amateur political schools. Strive for 8,000 people from all walks of life to study in various forms of political schools once in a short period of time. And require that within five to eight years, these 8,000 people take turns studying in the county political school once. Through study, people from all walks of life can better serve socialism and better carry out political and ideological transformation. In order to strive to enter socialism-communism together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party.

    曹县政治学校办得好
    对改造工商业者和社会人士起了很大作用
    马保三委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的报告，并完全同意陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    山东省的政协工作，和全国各省一样，在党中央、毛主席和省委的正确领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，一年来有了很大的开展，尤其在党的八届八中全会决议贯彻以来，除有关重大问题进行协商外，为了推动各界民主人士以中共八届八中全会文件为中心的学习、积极投入以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动新高潮，曾举行了多次经验交流会、报告会、现场会、专题讲座，并组织了七次参观访问，通过这些活动，对于推动各界人士更好的服务更好的改造有很大的收获。另外，省、市、县政协在组织和推动各界人士、工商业者、知识分子、社会人士参加劳动锻炼等工作，也作出了一些成绩。
    根据形势发展的需要和各界人士学习的要求，各级政治学校也有了新的发展，有的创造了很好的经验，现在我谨将曹县的政治学校情况向大会汇报一下。
    通过学习，大多数学员政治上都有显著进步，同时提高了文化水平，学会了生产技术
    曹县的政治学校已经办了两期，每期三个月，现在正在办第三期。第一、二期的学员都是工商业者，第三期除工商业者外，还吸收了一部分旧知识分子和散处在农村的社会人士。经过学习，大多数学员都有了比较明显的进步。他们从亲身的经验懂得在劳动生产和实践中继续学习、继续改造自己，对他们是有益的。第一、二期二百一十三人中有一百七十二人在校内学会了一种到几种生产技术。由于参加了劳动，进行了政治学习，和劳动人民有了比较多的共同语言，对三个万岁的认识比没有学习前也有显著的提高。学习回去后，有三分之一多一些的人（四十名）被评为先进工作者。同时学习了文化，补习了小学、初中的语文和数学，并有四十五人摘掉文盲帽子。这个学校还解决了一部分工商业者家属的生产和生活问题。组织家属饲养家禽、搞手工业，只今年1月份，每人平均即收入到十七元。1959年4至8月份，光割草一项，家属们收入即达一千五百元。现在有二百五十一户由于家属参加了生产增加了收入，改善了生活。这个学校白手起家，现在已有规模宏大的养殖场和园艺场。他们去年积肥一百二十万斤，供应市场蔬菜四十五万斤，上调猪羊一百五十余只。而且他们还搞了若干革新创造。有关单位纷纷要求把自己单位的私方人员、旧知识分子、社会人士送去学习。学员经过学习，认为“学习三个月，胜读十年书”每期都有一部分人，主动要求留校继续学习生产技术，有的愿意长期留校参加劳动生产。这个学校很好的贯彻了党的政策，真正作到了领导上，有关部门和学员三满意。他们这个学校是怎么办的呢？
    政治挂帅　勤俭办学　白手起家
    一、政治挂帅，勤俭办学，白手起家。学校的校址，原是一片荒域不毛的“乱葬岗子”。从生产搞起没有什么投资，没有房子，先搭草棚；没有教室，露天上课；没有教员，即由统战部和有关部门负责同志担任。这样在总路线的照耀下，从无到有，从小到大，短短一年的时间，已经自己建立校舍二十九间，各种畜棚二百八十间，开辟园艺九十六亩，养猪三百五十七头，牛二十八头，马两匹，驴两头，羊七百四十二只，海里鼠六十二只，鸡鸭八百只，蜂一百零八箱，鱼苗四万余尾，豆腐日产一千斤，另外，还建立了供技术革新用的铁、木车间。现在全校产值已达十万余元。学校就是这样办起来的，而且规模正在日益发展。
    敞开思想　联系实际　自由辩论
    二、学校的生产固然搞得很好，但主要任务还是学习。他们认真贯彻了政治思想为统帅，劳动实践为基础。认真贯彻正面教育和风细雨，入学之后即宣布政策，不戴帽子，敞开思想，联系实际，根据摆出来的问题，让他们搜集材料，自由辩论。为了帮助他们明辨是非，提高认识，除了他们自己讨论之外，采取三种作法：请有关部门负责同志作报告；请工农劳模作报告；参观访问。负责同志的报告，问题讲的全面，而且方针政策明确。由于他们参加了劳动，对工农劳模的报告就有了兴趣，看看人家，比比自己，多数人有“自愧不如”之感。再根据需要组织参观，特别是在参观中组织劳动人民中的积极分子开座谈会，也让他们自由访问，三者结合，效果很好。
    政治学习、劳动和技术革命三结合
    三、政治学习、劳动生产、技术革命三结合。学员除了政治学习、参加劳动外，还大搞技术革命和技术革新。学校设有技术革新委员会，各班都有技术革新小组。各班、组除设有学习班长、组长外，还设有生产技术班长、组长。在大跃进形势推动下，学校内部也形成人人搞革新，个个搞创造的空气。现在已研究成功的革新技术三十七种，如饲料粉碎机、铡草机、自动水车等等。经过参加技术革新和技术革命运动，大大有助于提高他们的学习和劳动热情。逐渐引导他们体会到世界是可以认识的，世界是可以改变的，使他们认识到要改变客观世界，首先改造主观世界的重要，促进他们自我教育自我改造的自觉性。这是启发他们改变旧的世界观的有效方法之一。
    县委加强领导，统战部和县政协主动配合
    四、这个学校为什么能办得这样有成绩呢？
    最根本的问题是县委的重视和加强领导。曹县八十三万人口中属于资产阶级范围的各界人士有八千人，其中，工商界三千五百人（其中资本家三十二人，小业主一千三百人，小商贩二千一百六十八人），文教界一千一百人，卫生界四百人，社会人士（包括宗教）三千人。他们经过历次的政治运动和自我改造，特别是1957年整风反右以后，是大有进步，但是他们的政治思想和世界观还需要继续改造，而且大多数人是可以改造的；经过改造可以更好的为社会主义建设服务。曹县县委认为把一切可以改造的人改造过来，这是党的责任，县委加强了这方面的领导，指示有关部门齐心合力抓紧时机，围绕中心，开展群众运动办好政治学校。
    其次，在县委领导下，统战部和县政协积极主动与有关部门协作。在这个协作中，统战部和县政协首先为有关部门服务，如帮助商业方面组织多余人员生产，有些工商业者的家属没有参加生产，造成工商业者的家庭若干困难，就通过政治学校组织她们搞各种手工业和副业生产。由于政治学校大搞园艺、饲养，对解决县城的蔬菜、肉类的供应有所补益，同时帮助公社搞技术革新等等。因此，各方面满意，各方面给予学校以有力的支持。学校没有教员，各单位负责同志去讲课，学校有什么困难，各方面都设法帮助，有关部门的密切协作，也是办好政治学校的重要条件。
    五、为了“调动一切可以调动的力量，改造一切可以改造的人”，他们计划以县政治学校为中心，大办业余政治学校。公社也准备办业余政治学校。争取各界人士八千人，在短期内都要进各种形式的政治学校学习一次。并要求在五至八年内，这八千人轮流进县政治学校学习一次。通过学习，使各界人士更好地为社会主义服务，更好的进行政治思想改造。以企与全国人民在党的领导下一同步入社会主义——共产主义。
