Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 15th: The Karl-Marx-Stadt district of the German Democratic Republic announced yesterday that it had achieved full agricultural cooperativization. Thus, in just over a month, from the Baltic coast to Thuringia, from the Oder-Neisse to the Elbe, the farmers of all fourteen districts of the Republic and the suburban areas of Democratic Berlin have 100% embarked on the road of socialist agricultural cooperation. With the exception of a very few areas of land unsuitable for large-scale cultivation, all of the Republic's approximately 6.4 million hectares of arable land are now entirely operated by agricultural production cooperatives and state farms.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the German Democratic Republic, in an interview with our reporter, said that in recent weeks, all farmers in the German Democratic Republic have joined agricultural production cooperatives at such a speed and scale, which shows that socialism has triumphed in the countryside. In all rural areas, farmers have begun to organize their lives in a socialist way.

Analyzing the reasons for the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the person in charge pointed out that this achievement did not fall from the sky. The reason why the socialist transformation of agriculture could develop on a large scale and rapidly is due to the hard work of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and state organs.

He said that agricultural production cooperatives, in the past, especially last year, showed their superiority over small-scale individual production, which gradually convinced farmers that under the conditions of individual cultivation, they had reached the limit of possible agricultural development, and that only by applying the latest science and technology in large-scale agricultural enterprises could production be further greatly developed. Farmers are increasingly aware that only by adopting socialist large-scale production can they overcome the backwardness caused by capitalist conditions in the countryside. Many farmers said that they have realized that they can only fully develop their talents and skills in cooperatives.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said that an important reason for the high-speed development of socialist transformation is the high tide of work that has been set off in party organizations and government agencies at all levels after the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. A large number of party and government workers went to the countryside to live and work with the farmers, striving for them to join agricultural production cooperatives, and helping the cooperatives organize production. The democratic parties and people's organizations also cooperated well in the National Front organization to help socialism win victory in the countryside. These cadres, in discussions with farmers, explained the relationship between socialist transformation and the struggle to solve the vital problems of the German nation. Many farmers said when joining agricultural cooperatives that they would rapidly increase agricultural production in order to do their part in the struggle to stop West German militarism.

When talking about the most important tasks of the current stage of agricultural socialist transformation, the person in charge emphasized that the main problem now is to fully organize the production of cooperatives and to develop and strengthen democracy in the newly organized cooperatives. The Party and the government, as well as the National Committee of the National Front, will help and support the new agricultural production cooperatives as much as possible. When talking about the work of the cooperatives, the person in charge said that the most important task at present is to attract all cooperative farmers to participate in the management of cooperative production. In advanced cooperatives, the main problems are the organization of leadership and the merger of several agricultural production cooperatives into one large unit. In order to help the new cooperatives develop smoothly, the best cooperatives have begun to send experienced cooperative farmers to work in the new cooperatives and lend them machines. The best agricultural production cooperatives and state farms are setting up inquiry offices where farmers from nearby cooperatives can inquire about issues related to organizing cooperative production.

When talking about the current situation of class struggle in the rural areas of the German Democratic Republic, the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said that because all farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives, the class struggle in the countryside has not stopped, but has taken on new forms under changed circumstances. The enemies of socialism in Germany are doing everything possible to sabotage and obstruct the construction of socialism. Therefore, it is extremely important to be vigilant in the countryside.

The person in charge finally said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has formulated a plan for the next stage of developing socialist agriculture. If all party organizations, government agencies, and all progressive forces in the Republic's countryside, with the support of the working class, maintain their enthusiasm in solving agricultural problems, then the cooperative farmers of the German Democratic Republic will undoubtedly gloriously fulfill their due responsibilities in the struggle to achieve the task of having ample food in the socialist camp.

### 在党和政府的正确领导和大力支持下  德国实现全部农业合作化  农民已开始按社会主义的方式组织生活

    在党和政府的正确领导和大力支持下
    德国实现全部农业合作化
    农民已开始按社会主义的方式组织生活
    新华社柏林15日电　德意志民主共和国卡尔·马克思斯塔特专区昨天已经宣布实现农业全部合作化。这样，在短短的一个多月中，从波罗的海沿岸到图宁根，从奥得尼斯河到易北河，整个共和国的十四个专区和柏林民主区郊区的农民就百分之百地走上了农业社会主义合作化的道路。除了个别地区的极少数不适于大规模耕种的土地以外，共和国大约六百四十万公顷的全部耕地，现在已经完全由农业生产合作社和国营农场经营。
    德意志民主共和国农林部负责人在接见本社记者时说，在最近几个星期中，德意志民主共和国全体农民以这样的速度和规模加入了农业生产合作社，这表明社会主义已经在农村中取得胜利。在所有的农村中，农民已经开始按社会主义的方式组织生活。
    这位负责人在分析农业合作化运动迅速发展的原因时指出，这个成绩不是从天上掉下来的，农业社会主义改造之所以能够大规模和迅速发展，是由于德国统一社会党和国家机构努力工作的结果。
    他说，农业生产合作社在以前，特别是在去年，表现出它对小规模的个体生产具有优越性，这就使农民们逐渐相信这样的道理：在个体耕种的条件下，他们已经达到农业生产可能发展的极限，只有在大规模的农业企业中应用最新的科学技术，才能使生产得到进一步的大发展。农民们愈来愈认识到，只有采取社会主义的大规模生产，才能克服农村中由于资本主义条件所造成的落后状态。许多农民说，他们已经认识到，他们只有在合作社里才能充分发挥自己的才干和技能。
    农林部负责人说，社会主义改造高速度发展的一个重要原因是德国统一社会党中央委员会第七次全体会议以后在各级党组织和政府机构中掀起了一个工作的高潮。大批党和政府的工作人员到农村中同农民同住同劳动，争取他们加入农业生产合作社，并且帮助合作社组织了生产。各民主党派和人民团体在全国阵线组织中也很好地进行合作，帮助社会主义在农村中取得胜利。这些干部在同农民进行讨论时，解释了社会主义改造同解决德意志民族的切身问题的斗争之间的关系。许多农民在加入农业合作社时说，他们要迅速增加农业生产，以便在制止西德军国主义的斗争中尽一份力量。
    这位负责人在谈到农业社会主义改造现阶段的最重要的任务时强调说，现在主要的问题是全力组织合作社的生产以及在新组织的合作社中发展和加强民主。党和政府，以及全国阵线全国委员会将尽可能地帮助和支持新的农业生产合作社。这位负责人在谈到合作社的工作时说，当前最重要的任务是，吸引全体合作农民参加管理合作社的生产。在先进的合作社里，主要是组织领导以及把几个农业生产合作社合并成为一个大单位等的问题。为了帮助新的合作社顺利发展，最好的合作社已开始派有经验的合作农民到新的社去工作，并且把机器借给它们使用。最好的农业生产合作社和国营农场正在设立询问处，在它们附近的合作社的农民可以到询问处询问有关组织合作生产的问题。
    农林部负责人在谈到有关德意志民主共和国农村阶级斗争的当前形势时说，由于全体农民加入了农业合作社，农村中的阶级斗争并没有停止，而是在变化了的情况下采取新的方式。德国国内的社会主义的敌人正在千方百计地破坏和阻挠社会主义事业建设。因此，在农村中提高警惕是极其重要的。
    这位负责人最后说，德国统一社会党中央委员会第八次全体会议已经制订了下一阶段发展社会主义农业的计划。如果共和国农村中所有的党组织、政府机构以及在工人阶级支持下的所有的进步力量在解决农业问题时，保持他们的热情，那么，德意志民主共和国的合作农民无疑地将会在实现在社会主义阵营中使粮食绰有余裕这个任务的斗争中光荣地完成自己应尽的责任。
