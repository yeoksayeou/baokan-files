Art From Life
    —— After Viewing the "Guizhou Province National Folk Craft Art Exhibition"
    Ma Zhengrong

    Guizhou is a province with many ethnic groups, including Han, Miao, Buyi, Dong, Shui, Yao, and Yi. Over a long period of labor and life, the people of all ethnic groups have created many beautiful folk arts and crafts, demonstrating their high artistic talents and wisdom. Each ethnic group's artistic creations has its own unique style. But whatever the craft, they all have one thing in common: they come from life, from the people, and are closely related to the lives of the masses.

    The "Guizhou Province National Folk Craft Art Exhibition" recently held in Beijing, concentrated on showing the rich and colorful artistic flowers of the various ethnic groups in Guizhou. There are more than ten varieties, including embroidery, batik, cross-stitch, weaving, ceramics, lacquerware, bamboo weaving, silver jewelry, paper-cutting, wood carving, stone carving, and folk toys, totaling more than six hundred pieces. The most prominent of these are clothing patterns, such as embroidery, batik, cross-stitch, and weaving, whose patterns and colors have unique styles. The Miao people in southeastern Guizhou prefer to use embroidery as the main clothing pattern, with bright colors and diverse embroidery methods, commonly including crepe embroidery, braid embroidery, and flat embroidery. Crepe embroidery and braid embroidery are not easily torn by thorns when working uphill because of the thick embroidery, so they are often used by the local Miao people. Batik is one of the most distinctive handicrafts in Guizhou Province, with monochrome, mixed-color, and multi-color types, with bright and simple tones, and rich decoration. A batik wax plate is a semi-finished product of batik (i.e., beeswax is dotted on white cloth). Sometimes, new wax and old wax are interspersed together during the dotting process, resulting in different shades of color, which also has a unique style, looking like a complete work of art. Cross-stitch in Guizhou is commonly divided into two types: flat stitch and cross stitch, which are divided into two categories: plain stitch (white background with black pattern) and colored stitch (green background with colored pattern). The Han and Dong ethnic groups prefer plain stitch, while the Miao people in the Huaxi area of Guiyang City prefer colored stitch, each with its own characteristics and different from each other. Weaving is divided into silk weaving, wool weaving, and cotton weaving. Silk weaving is relatively delicate and magnificent, such as the waistbands in Kaili and Jianhe and the Tujin of the Buyi ethnic group in Dushan, all of which have these characteristics. Weining and Hezhang in northwestern Guizhou are rich in wool. The Miao people living there are good at wool weaving. Common ones include shawls and blankets woven with a mixture of red, black, and brown colors. Cotton weaving is relatively simple, generally with black and white patterns, such as the pockets and quilt covers of the Dong ethnic group in Liping.

    In terms of pattern content, there are figures, dragons and phoenixes, flowers and birds, fish and insects, and animals, encompassing everything, but all are closely related to life, reflecting life, and some express infinite good wishes and interesting little stories. For example, the Miao people in the Qingshui River area of southeastern Guizhou like to use fish, shrimp, crabs, dragons, etc. as decorative content. The Miao people near the slopes prefer to use flowers, butterflies, chickens, cows, horses, figures, etc. as embroidery content. In addition, there are reflections of daily life, such as cowherds grazing cattle, riding horses to market, and descriptions of customs and habits. For example, the Miao people in the Qingshui River area have a grand festival in late May of the lunar calendar – the Dragon Boat Race. Therefore, a dragon boat is embroidered on the embroidery, with many people standing on it, reflecting their festive and joyful mood. The Miao people in Kaili and Jianhe in southeastern Guizhou like to use dragons as clothing patterns. After our interviews, there is also such a legend: Southeastern Guizhou is a plateau mountainous area with many terraced fields and a shortage of water sources. Before liberation, the Miao people called this type of field "Looking at the Sky Water Field," relying on the rain to get a harvest and suffering from drought and starvation. Therefore, the girls have a beautiful wish to embroider a dragon on their sleeves or waistbands to symbolize a good harvest every year. This legend well illustrates the relationship between the content of the pattern and life.

    In addition to clothing patterns, other handicrafts are also closely related to life. For example, the earthenware of the Yazhou People's Commune in Dushan County is daily necessities: rice pots, teapots, teacups, oil pots, sugar pots, etc. There is also a salt and chili pot, with two pots connected together, which is very interesting. Generally speaking, the quality of these products is still relatively rough, but the style is simple. The Dong bamboo rice backpacks and rice baskets are used by Dong farmers to hold glutinous rice and pickles when going uphill for production. There are several sizes, large, medium, and small, suitable for adults and children to bring meals. In addition, the folk toys produced by the Yazhou Commune have simple and interesting shapes that are endearing. Generally, they can be blown loudly and can also be used as display items, which are very popular among the masses.

    In the exhibition hall, there are also a small number of new products on display, such as carpets, screens, sofa cushions, tablecloths, wall hangings, etc. Although the proportion is small, and there are still some shortcomings, the development prospects of these new crafts are very large. They have begun to apply the decorations that were previously limited to clothing to the daily necessities of the masses, which is of great significance.

    Under the brilliant light of the Party's national policy, and under the shining of the three red banners of the general line, the people's commune, and the great leap forward, the motherland's industry and agriculture are leaping forward at a rapid pace. Those dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and birds of the past can no longer express people's new thoughts. We can find proof from the paper-cuts that the masses like. What they are cutting are new contents such as the People's Liberation Army riding big horses and carrying red flags, with a double-wheeled double-furrow plow placed next to them, and several doves of peace flying freely.

    This exhibition once again shows that our country's cultural heritage is extremely rich, and we need to better explore, organize, and learn from it, and at the same time innovate it.

    来自生活的艺术
    ——“贵州省民族民间工艺美展”观后
    马正荣
    贵州是一个多民族的省份，包括有汉、苗、布依、侗、水、瑶、彝等民族。各族人民在长期的劳动生活中，创造出了许多优美的民间工艺美术品，表现了他们在艺术创造上很高的才能和智慧，并且每个民族的艺术创造，都有着独特的风格。但是无论哪种工艺品，都有一个共同特点，那就是来自生活，来自民间，和群众的生活有着密切的联系。
    最近在京举行的“贵州省民族民间工艺美术展览会”，集中地表现了贵州各族人民丰富多采的艺术花朵，有刺绣、蜡染、挑花、编织、陶瓷、漆器、竹编、银饰、剪纸、木雕、石刻、民间玩具等十多个品种，共六百余件。其中最突出的是服饰图案，如刺绣、蜡染、挑花、编织等，纹样和色彩都具有独特的风格。黔东南一带的苗族，喜欢用刺绣来作为主要服饰图案，色彩绚丽，绣法多样，常见的有绉绣、辫绣、平绣等数种。绉绣和辫绣由于绣法厚实，上坡劳动也不容易被荆棘挂烂，因此常为当地苗族所采用。蜡染是贵州省民间最有特色的一种工艺品，有单色、间色、彩色三种，色调明快、朴素大方、富有装饰性。蜡版是蜡染的半成品，（即蜂蜡点在白布上）有时在点时，用新蜡、老蜡穿插在一起，变成深浅不同的色调，也别有风貌，看去像一件完整的艺术品。挑花在贵州常见的有平挑和十字挑两种，分为素挑（白底黑花）和彩挑（青底彩花）两大类。汉族和侗族盛行素挑，贵阳市花溪一带的苗族，却喜欢用彩挑，各具特色，互不相同。编织分为丝织、毛织、棉织三种，丝织比较精致富丽，如凯里、剑河一带的围腰，独山布依族的土锦，都具有这类特点。黔西北的威宁、赫章一带盛产羊毛，住在那边的苗族擅长毛织，常见的有红、黑、褐三色混合织成的披肩，毯子等。棉织比较朴素，一般以黑白花纹较多，如黎平侗族的口袋、被面等。
    在纹样内容上，有人物、龙凤、花鸟、鱼虫、走兽等等无一不包，但都是紧密联系生活，反映生活，有的寄予无限美好愿望和富有生趣的小故事。如黔东南清水江一带的苗族，她们就喜欢用鱼、虾、螃蟹、龙等等来作为装饰内容。接近坡上一带的苗族，又比较喜欢用花、蝴蝶、鸡、牛、马、人物等等来作为刺绣内容。此外，反映日常生活的，如牧童放牛，骑马赶场等，描写风俗习惯的，如清水江一带的苗族，逢旧历五月下旬，有一个盛大的节日——爬龙船，因而在刺绣上就绣有一条龙船，上面站着很多人，反映他们节日欢庆喜悦的心情。在黔东南凯里、剑河一带的苗族，很喜欢用龙来作为服饰图案，经过我们访问，其中还有这样一种传说：黔东南是高原山区、梯田众多，水源缺乏，解放前苗族人民称这种田为“望天水田”，靠天下雨得收，干旱挨饿，因此姑娘们都有一种美好的愿望，喜欢在自己的衣袖或围腰上绣上一条龙，来象征年年的丰产。这个传说很好地说明了纹样的内容和生活的关系。
    除了服饰图案外，其它工艺品也是和生活息息相关的，如独山县牙舟人民公社的土陶器，就是生活中的日常用品：饭罐、茶壶、茶碗、油壶、糖罐等等，还有一种盐巴辣椒罐，两个罐联系在一起，很有地方风趣。这些产品一般说质量都还比较粗糙，但是风格朴实。侗族的竹器饭背包、饭提箩，是侗族农民上坡生产时，盛糯米饭和咸菜用的，有大中小数种，适用于大人小孩带饭用。此外，牙舟公社生产的民间玩具，造型简洁，生动有趣，逗人喜爱，一般都能吹得响，又可以作陈设品，很受群众欢迎。
    在展览馆中，还陈列有少数新产品，如地毯、屏风、沙发靠垫，桌布、壁挂等等，虽然比重较小，而且也还存在着一些缺点，但是这些新工艺品的发展前途是很大的，它们已开始把过去只限用在服饰方面的装饰，运用到广大群众的日常用品中，这是有很大意义的。
    在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，在总路线、人民公社、大跃进三面红旗的照耀下，祖国的工农业正在一日千里地飞跃，过去那些龙啊、凤啊、花啊、鸟啊已经不能表达人们的新思想，我们可以从群众喜欢的剪纸上找到证明，她们剪着的已是解放军骑着大马，扛着红旗，旁边放着双轮双铧犁，还有几只和平鸽自由地在飞翔等等的新内容了。
    这一次展览会，再一次显示出我国的文化遗产，是极其丰富的，需要我们更好地发掘、整理和学习，同时加以革新。
