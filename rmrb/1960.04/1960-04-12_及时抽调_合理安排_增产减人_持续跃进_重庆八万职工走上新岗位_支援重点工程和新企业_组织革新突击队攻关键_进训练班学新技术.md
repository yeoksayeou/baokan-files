Chongqing: Supporting Key Projects and New Enterprises, Organizing Innovation Shock Brigades to Tackle Key Problems, Entering Training Classes to Learn New Technologies
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Chongqing, April 11th) Chongqing promptly and rationally arranged the large amount of labor saved through the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, basically solving the problem of labor shortages in the city's continued leap forward this year, and further promoting the development of production and technical revolution movements.

    By the end of March, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in Chongqing had increased from the original 32% to 60%. Due to the improvement of the level of mechanization, the city's industry, transportation, capital construction, and trade departments saved more than 80,000 laborers.

    Chongqing first arranged this large number of saved laborers in key projects and newly put into production units with larger production increase tasks such as steel and coke, and paid attention to strengthening the weak links in transportation, electricity, and other departments. Of the more than 12,000 people saved from the large steel plants, 7,600 were strengthened in key construction projects and newly put into production blast furnaces and coke ovens. The coal mine system used half of the more than 6,000 laborers saved to support key construction projects such as mountain railway transportation lines, landslide coal bunkers, new coal shafts, and coal washing plants, in order to accelerate the early completion of these projects.

    The lack of raw materials is the key to affecting the continuous leap forward of the chemical system. Therefore, in addition to transferring some manpower to support new plants, this system also arranged more than 38% of its manpower to vigorously engage in the "small indigenous groups" producing raw materials. In the past two months, seven "small indigenous groups" raw material production workshops have been expanded relying on this force; 148 new products have been trial-produced and produced, which has played a significant role in meeting the needs of the system's production development.

    Secondly, the saved labor force was organized into technical innovation and technical revolution shock brigades to specialize in tackling key problems and weak links in technical innovation. Wherever there are difficulties, this team supports it; wherever this team goes, more labor is saved. Now, factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing have drawn more than 7,000 people from the saved labor force to form many such shock brigades. A technical revolution shock brigade of more than 200 people from the Changjiang Electrical Factory manufactured major technical innovation equipment such as automatic twisting machines and motor stator winding machines, overcame many key technical problems, and saved hundreds of workers. Another group of saved laborers formed shock brigades to help the workshops carry out innovation. In this way, wave after wave, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the whole factory rolls forward. Now, the level of mechanization in the whole factory has increased from 43% at the end of last year to 76%.

    In order to further meet the needs of production development and continuously supplement the team familiar with new technologies, Chongqing arranged 5,000 people to train and improve in various technical training classes. Forty-five of the more than fifty long-distance ships of the Chongqing Branch of the Changjiang Shipping Administration have been equipped with "six-in-one" devices. This device is the most important innovation project in ship transportation, combining six operations: driving, piloting, steering, whistling, engine telegraph, and starting. However, most ships cannot use it because they cannot master the new technology. The Changjiang Shipping Administration concentrated 68% of the saved labor force to train drivers who master the new "six-in-one" technology and electricians who maintain and maintain the "six-in-one" device. The transportation department transferred 30% of its labor force for training to expand the technical team and meet the needs of increased vehicles.

    Various enterprises and financial and trade departments have also drawn more than 7,000 laborers to support agricultural production. Technicians from the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory and the Water Turbine Factory were sent to rural commune agricultural machinery factories to install milling machines, lathes and other equipment, and pumping stations. The Nanyang Cigarette Factory drew a group of people from the saved manpower to run training classes in rural areas of Fuling, Changshou, Ba County, and Qijiang counties in Sichuan, teaching techniques and guiding communes in tobacco production. Many commercial workers also went to the countryside to help rural areas set up agricultural and sideline product processing plants, fertilizer plants, and farm tool factories.

    This year, Chongqing's production has increased greatly, so enterprises generally feel a shortage of labor. According to the initial statistics of the Municipal Labor Bureau at the beginning of the year, at least 48,000 additional laborers are needed this year. In order to solve this problem and achieve "increasing production without increasing manpower" and "increasing production while reducing manpower," the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the timely and rational use and arrangement of labor saved in the technical innovation movement. The Municipal Party Committee believes that this is an important issue to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks and to promote the more rapid development of the current technical innovation movement. Therefore, while planning to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also formulated indicators for saving labor and plans for arranging labor. The Municipal Party Committee also convened a meeting of party committee secretaries of factories and mining enterprises to seriously discuss and formulate the principles for adjusting and arranging labor, and implemented the indicators for saving labor to each unit. Party committees at all levels of districts, counties, factories, mining enterprises and labor allocation departments of municipalities, districts, counties, factories, and mining enterprises have strengthened their leadership. Many bureaus or factory and mining enterprises have established committees or groups to adjust and save labor, and specially equipped cadres to study and solve new situations and new problems in arranging labor. Generally, all units have adopted the method of implementing a batch of innovation projects, that is, concentrating a batch of personnel, and then transferring them to the most needed production posts, so that each laborer is used on the cutting edge without any wasted work.

### 及时抽调　合理安排　增产减人　持续跃进  重庆八万职工走上新岗位  支援重点工程和新企业　组织革新突击队攻关键　进训练班学新技术

    及时抽调　合理安排　增产减人　持续跃进
    重庆八万职工走上新岗位
    支援重点工程和新企业　组织革新突击队攻关键　进训练班学新技术
    本报重庆11日电　重庆市及时合理地安排技术革新和技术革命运动中节约出来的大量劳动力，基本上解决了全市今年继续跃进中劳动力不足的问题，进一步促进了生产和技术革命运动的发展。
    截至3月底止，重庆市机械化和半机械化水平由原来的32％提高到60％。由于机械化水平的提高，全市工业、交通运输、基本建设和贸易部门节约的劳动力达八万多人。
    重庆市对节约出来的这一大批劳动力，首先是安排在钢铁、煤焦等增产任务较大、需要扩建和新建的重点工程及新投入生产的单位，并且注意加强了交通运输、电力等部门的薄弱环节。各大型钢铁厂节约出来的一万二千多人中，就有七千六百人加强了重点建设工程和新投入生产的高炉及焦炉。煤矿系统从节约出来的六千多个劳动力中，以一半人力支援了矿山铁路运输专线、滑坡式煤仓、新煤井和洗煤厂等重点建设工程，以加速这批工程的提前建成。
    原材料缺乏是影响化工系统持续跃进的关键。因此，这个系统除抽调一部分人力支援新建厂以外，还把38％以上的人力都安排在大搞“小土群”生产原料材料方面。两个多月来，依靠这批力量扩建的“小土群”原料生产车间就有七个；试制和生产的新产品达一百四十八种，对满足这个系统生产发展的需要起了很大的作用。
    其次，是把节约出来的劳动力组成技术革新和技术革命突击队，专攻技术革新中的关键问题和薄弱环节。那里有困难，这支队伍就支援那里；这支队伍到那里，那里就节约出更多的劳动力。现在重庆市各厂矿企业已经从节约出来的劳动力中抽出了七千多人组成许多这样的突击队。长江电工厂组成的一支二百多人的技术革命突击队，制造出自动扭线机、马达锭子嵌线机等重大技术革新机具，攻克了许多技术关键问题，节约出好几百名工人。节约出来的劳动力中又有一批组成了突击队，帮助各车间搞革新。这样一浪推一浪，促进全厂技术革新和技术革命运动滚滚向前。现在全厂机械化程度已由去年底的43％提高到76％。
    为了进一步满足生产发展的需要和不断补充熟悉新技术的队伍，重庆市安排了五千人在各种技术训练班培训、提高。长江航运管理局重庆分局五十多条长航轮船中，有四十五条安上了“六合一”装置。这种装置是轮船运输中最主要的革新项目，将驾驶、引水、掌舵、鸣笛、车钟、开车六项操作合一。但是，大多数船因为掌握不了新技术，不能运用。长航局把节约出来的劳动力的68％，集中起来培训掌握“六合一”新技术的驾驶员和维护、保养“六合一”装置的电工。交通运输部门抽调了30％的劳动力进行培训，扩大技术队伍，满足车辆增加的需要。
    各企业单位和财贸部门还抽出了七千多名劳动力，支援农业生产。重庆机床厂和水轮机厂派到农村的技术人员，为公社农具机械厂安装了铣床、车床等设备和抽水机站。南洋烟厂从节约的人力中抽出一批人员，到四川涪陵、长寿、巴县、綦江等县农村开办训练班，传授技术，指导公社进行烟叶生产。许多商业职工也下乡帮助农村兴办农副业产品加工厂、化肥厂、农具厂。
    今年重庆市生产跃进的幅度很大，因此各企业普遍感到劳动力不足。据市劳动局在年初的初步统计，今年至少需要增加劳动力四万八千人。为了解决这个问题，作到“增产不增人”、“增产还减人”，中共重庆市委十分重视及时、合理地使用和安排在技术革新运动中节约出来的劳动力。市委认为，这是保证今年生产任务的完成和推动当前技术革新运动更加迅猛发展的一个重要课题。因此，中共重庆市委在规划开展技术革新和技术革命运动的同时，也制订了节约劳动力的指标和安排劳动力的规划。市委还召开了厂矿企业党委书记会议，认真讨论和制定调整、安排劳动力的原则，并且把节约劳动力的指标落实到各个单位。区、县、厂矿企业单位各级党委以及市、区、县、厂矿企业劳动调配部门，都加强了领导工作。许多局或厂矿企业单位成立了调整节约劳动力的委员会或小组，专门配备干部研究和解决安排劳动力中出现的新情况、新问题。各单位一般都采取实现一批革新项目，即集中一批人员，又把他们调到最需要的生产岗位上去，使每个劳动力都用到刀口上，而不发生窝工现象。
