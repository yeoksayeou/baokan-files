甲—U.S. Imperialist Representative in South Korea
乙—Li Seung-man

甲: (Scolding angrily) What have you been doing? Speak!
乙: Your Excellency, please calm down! I, I’ve been doing everything according to your instructions!
甲: Nonsense!
乙: Not at all! Didn't you tell me to create a free Korea within the free world? I've been doing it with all my heart!
甲: What exactly have you done?
乙: A lot! Freedom everywhere! Excellent results! Look, hundreds of thousands of men have gained the freedom to be unemployed! Hundreds of thousands of women have gained the freedom to sell themselves! Hundreds of thousands of children have gained the freedom not to go to school and not to eat!
甲: Is that all you’ve done?
乙: Of course not! I've also vigorously promoted democracy. Anyone who doesn't elect me as president, including the councilors, gains the freedom to be beaten and the freedom to be imprisoned! If you don't believe me, Your Excellency, please take a look at our free prisons, where there are many people wearing the shackles of freedom! Have I done anything wrong?
甲: Hmph! You rogue, all you do is wag your tongue!
乙: No, Your Excellency! I don't just wag my tongue, I have a loyal heart! You see, whatever benefits your country's big bosses want, have I ever shaken my head? Never! They have the freedom to plunder, and I have the freedom to offer it with both hands. It's a perfect match of freedom meeting freedom! Your country's troops and officers have the freedom to drive jeeps while drunk, often running over our free people. Have I ever spoken out? No! You are free to rampage, and our people are free to die. Isn't that another perfect match? I feel that I have lived up to your country's love and the freedom of your country's god! But, but...
甲: But what? Speak frankly!
乙: But your country's aid to us...
甲: Is the aid little? Don't be ungrateful!
乙: Not little! Not little! But the ships and ships of razors, pipes, and toilet paper you send... are, are expensive and can't be eaten! The more things you send, the poorer and hungrier the people become!
甲: Didn't we send rice and flour?
乙: Yes, but it's all rotten!
甲: You're confused! If we didn't give you the freedom to have rotten rice and flour, how else could we lead the free world?
乙: Yes! Yes! Your Excellency, please don't be angry!
甲: You're making me angry! Also, we gave you so much military equipment, including missiles, why don't you kowtow and thank us?
乙: I kowtow every day! But the more military equipment I have, the more soldiers I have to recruit, and the bigger the military expenditure...
甲: Your military expenditure is high, didn't we send troops? Aren't they staying here?
乙: Yes! Yes, they are staying here! But those military gentlemen are not very good at fighting. They are very good at molesting women, smuggling, and drinking!
甲: You are insulting our freedom-defending army! I don't think your throne will last long!
乙: It won't last long, aren't the people of the whole country telling me to get out?
甲: That's the Communists doing it!
乙: Your Excellency, you know I'm anti-Communist every day! But how is it that everywhere, even the old and the children dare to snatch the tanks you gave me, and tell me to get out? I shoot, but they don't retreat?
甲: You are a super-sized idiot!
乙: If I'm an idiot, what brilliant ideas do you have?
甲: Me?
乙: You! Your Excellency!
甲: I...
乙: You! Your Excellency! Quickly give me an idea and save my life!
甲: I, I say you are an idiot, a useless slave!
乙: Don't just scold me, give me an idea! If the people win, won't you and I lose our freedom and democracy? I didn't expect the people to have such great energy!
甲: It's your incompetence! We let you get rich for nothing, and let you drink our Coca-Cola every day for nothing!
乙: Stop scolding me, give me an idea!
甲: I have the freedom to scold you, and the freedom to not come up with ideas!
乙: Alas! I think I probably have to scramble off! You also have to be careful!
甲: What do I have to be careful about? I will never roll on the ground!
乙: Not roll?
甲: I have a helicopter!

    李承晚滚开了（小相声）
    老舍
    甲——美帝驻南朝鲜代表
    乙——李承晚甲：（怒叱）你这是怎么搞的？说！
    乙：大人息怒！我，我都照着您的办法搞的！
    甲：胡说！
    乙：一点不胡说！您不是叫我搞自由世界里的自由朝鲜吗？我就忠心耿耿地搞啦！
    甲：都搞了什么？
    乙：很多呀！处处自由！成绩很好！您看，男子成千上万得到失业的自由！女子成千上万得到卖身的自由！孩子们成千上万得到不上学，也不吃饭的自由！
    甲：难道这就够了吗？
    乙：当然不够！我还力行民主，谁不选我作总统，连议员在内，谁就得到挨揍的自由，下狱的自由！大人不信，请看看我们的自由监狱去，那里有多少带着自由锁镣的人啊！难道我作错了吗？
    甲：哼！你这个流氓，就会嚼舌头！
    乙：不啊，大人！我不光嚼舌头，我有一片忠心啊！您看，贵国的大老板们要什么利益，我摇过头没有？没有！他们有抢夺的自由，我有双手奉送的自由，真是自由碰上了自由，恰合口径！贵国的部队官兵有喝醉了开吉普车的自由，时常撞死我们自由的老百姓，我出过声没有？没有！您们横行得自由，我们的百姓死得自由，不是又恰对口径吗？我觉得我对得起贵国的垂爱，对得起贵国的自由之神！可是，可是……
    甲：可是什么？痛痛快快地说！
    乙：可是贵国对我们的援助……
    甲：援助还少吗？别忘恩负义！
    乙：不少！不少！可是，您们运来的一船一船的刮脸刀、烟斗、手纸……都，都又贵又当不了饭吃呀！您运来的东西越多，老百姓也越穷越饿！
    甲：我们没运来大米、白面吗？
    乙：运来了，可全是臭的！甲：你胡涂！我们要没有给你臭米臭面的自由，我们还怎么领导自由世界呢？
    乙：是！是！大人别生气！
    甲：你招我生气嘛！还有，我们给了你多少军火，还有导弹，你怎么不磕头谢恩？乙：我天天磕头！不过，军火越多，我越得多招兵买兵，军费越大……
    甲：你的军费大，我们难道没派兵来？住在这儿不走吗？
    乙：是！是住在这儿不走！可是那些兵老爷不大敢打仗，调戏妇女，走私，喝酒，倒都很内行！
    甲：你污辱我们的保卫自由的军队！我看你的宝座坐不长了！
    乙：是坐不长了，全国的人民不是都叫我滚开吗？
    甲：那是共产党搞的！
    乙：大人，您知道，我天天反共！可是，怎么到处连老人带小孩也敢抢您送给我的坦克车，都叫我滚开呢？我开枪，他们也不退呢？
    甲：你就是特大号的饭桶！
    乙：我是饭桶，您又有什么高明主意呢？
    甲：我？
    乙：您！大人！
    甲：我……
    乙：您！大人！快出个主意，救救命吧！
    甲：我，我说你是饭桶，没用的奴才！
    乙：别光骂我，不出主意啊！老百姓要是胜利了，您跟我不就都丧失了自由与民主吗？没想到啊，老百姓会有这么大的劲头！
    甲：是你无能！我们白叫你发了财，白叫你天天喝我们的可口可乐！
    乙：别骂啦，出主意！
    甲：我有骂你的自由，有想不出主意的自由！
    乙：唉！我看我大概非滚开不可了！您也得提防着点！
    甲：我提防什么？我决不在地上滚！
    乙：不滚？
    甲：我有直升飞机！
