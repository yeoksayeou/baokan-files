Xinhua News Agency Report: Indigenous steel and iron have played a significant role in various parts of Guangdong. Currently, all parts of the province not only use indigenous steel and iron to produce general small farm tools and small hardware for daily use, such as hoes, shovels, sickles, axes, iron pots, kitchen knives, pickaxes, and steel hammers, but also produce more complex semi-mechanized farm tools and equipment, such as slicers, rice milling machines, axle centers for carts, scales, pliers, indigenous lathes, and indigenous rolling mills as finished products or parts. Some factories also use indigenous steel and iron to process delicate Yangjiang knives, thinner saw blades, and refined hair scissors.

Over the past year, the province has used indigenous steel and iron to produce more than ten million pieces of various agricultural tools, implements, and small hardware for daily use, worth more than 40 million yuan. The widespread use of indigenous steel and iron has powerfully supported the technical transformation of agriculture and promoted the development of local industries. In 1959, Xingning County used more than 4,600 tons of indigenous steel and iron and 575 tons of scrap iron to produce 287 kinds of agricultural tools and machinery parts, totaling 4.38 million pieces, which not only met the needs of agricultural production and people's lives in the county, but also allocated 570,000 pieces to support six fraternal provinces and cities and 38 counties and cities within the province. The hardware and agricultural tool factory of Huaixiang Commune in Gaozhou County was initially a manual operation farm tool factory last year. Within a year, it used indigenous steel and iron to manufacture more than 500 kinds of agricultural tools and implements, totaling 340,000 pieces, and also imitated and created equipment such as electric drills, lathes, planers, screw machines, rolling mills, and needle-making machines to equip itself. Now, this factory has achieved semi-mechanized production.

    广东广泛利用土钢土铁
    据新华社讯　土钢土铁在广东各地发挥了很大的作用。现在全省各地不仅用土钢土铁生产了一般小农具和日用小五金，如锄、锹、镰刀、斧头、铁锅、菜刀、十字镐、钢锤等，还能生产较复杂的半机械化农具和工具，如切片机、碾米机、力车轴心、磅秤、老虎钳、土车床和土轧钢机等成品或配件。有的工厂还用土钢土铁加工小巧的阳江小刀，较薄的锯片和精致的发剪等。
    一年来，全省利用土钢土铁生产了各种农具、工具和日用小五金一千多万件，价值四千多万元。土钢土铁的广泛利用，有力地支援了农业技术改造，促进了地方工业的发展。兴宁县1959年利用土钢土铁四千六百多吨，废杂铁五百七十五吨，生产了农具和机械配件二百八十七种，共四百三十八万件，不仅满足了本县农业生产和人民生活的需要，还拨出五十七万件支援了六个兄弟省市和省内三十八个县市。高州县怀乡公社五金农具厂去年初只是一个手工操作的农具厂，一年内利用土钢土铁制造农具、工具五百多种共三十四万件，还仿制和创制了电钻、车床、刨床、螺丝机、轧钢机、制针机等设备装备了自己。现在，这个厂已经实现了半机械化生产。
