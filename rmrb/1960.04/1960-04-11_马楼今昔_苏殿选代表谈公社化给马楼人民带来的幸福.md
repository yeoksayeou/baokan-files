Comrade Representatives:

I warmly support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Today, I will mainly talk about the happiness that communization has brought to the people of Malou.

The Malou People's Commune is located in the southeastern part of Lushan County, Henan Province, and is a shallow mountainous area. The entire commune has twenty production brigades, more than 49,900 people, and more than 73,000 mu of cultivated land. Now, when people come to our commune, they can see an artificial lake surrounded by green mountains at the foot of Peng Mountain. This is the Penghe Reservoir newly built by the commune. Below the lake is a Penghe Canal, irrigating more than 200,000 mu of land from east to west. The three hydroelectric power stations completed before last year's National Day have enabled many farmers to use electric lights. The seven tractors purchased by the commune are working day and night. Our long-cherished ideals of "no cattle needed for plowing and no oil needed for lighting lamps" have begun to be realized.

	Before Liberation, Malou was: Floods and disasters, fertile land turned into a vast ocean

Although the Malou People's Commune is a beautiful and rich place, before liberation, due to the oppression and exploitation by the Kuomintang and landlords, coupled with years of drought and flood disasters, the broad masses of people lived a life worse than that of cattle and horses for many years. At that time, the masses circulated two folk songs: "The Penghe River is long and winding, floods and disasters cause suffering, thousands of houses collapse, fertile land turns into a vast ocean," "The sky is high and people's hearts are cold, poisonous snakes coil around the body, grass roots are eaten as food, tears nourish parents." This is a true reflection of the production and life of the masses at that time.

In 1948, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Malou were liberated. Land reform was implemented in 1949. In 1950, in order to actively develop production and take the road to common prosperity, the broad masses of farmers began to establish mutual aid teams. In 1952, elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives were established. In the second year of the cooperative's establishment, the single-crop wheat yield reached 306 jin, more than double that of individual farmers. This attracted more farmers to actively demand to join the cooperative. By the first half of 1955, 52 elementary cooperatives had been organized in the whole township. In the winter of 1955, the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, and the 52 elementary cooperatives were built into an advanced agricultural producers' cooperative with more than 5,000 farmers participating. In 1957, the grain yield per mu reached 603 jin, more than three times that of 1948 before liberation; and in the first year after the establishment of the advanced cooperative, a five-li long Shahe Canal was dug, and 321 wells were drilled, expanding the irrigation area of the whole cooperative to 18,000 mu, making some land initially achieve water conservancy. These vivid facts powerfully prove that agricultural producers' cooperatives are far superior to the individual economy in transforming nature and developing production. However, this did not fundamentally change the natural landscape of Malou Township. Once there was a severe drought, the canals and ponds dried up, and the well water dropped; once it rained heavily, it became a flood. Therefore, solving the problem of drought and flood disasters is still the urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers. In order to completely solve this problem, the Malou Township Party Committee made a serious study in the winter of 1957 and decided to fundamentally control the Penghe River, diverting water from east to west to irrigate the land of Malou Township. After a great battle in winter and spring, a Penghe dam, 15 meters long and 7 meters wide, was built. According to the plan, a Penghe Reservoir with a storage capacity of 59 million cubic meters and irrigating 200,000 mu of land was to be built. This grand plan was warmly supported by the broad masses, and everyone was full of determination and confidence in fundamentally controlling the Penghe River. In that year, the township mobilized a total of 4,500 laborers to invest in the Penghe River management project. However, building the Penghe Reservoir also exposed several problems that were difficult for our one cooperative to solve. First, building the Penghe Reservoir would require the occupation of more than 1,500 mu of land and more than 250 households' houses in nine villages, including the E'ao Dapo of outside cooperatives; second, holding such a large project would require 2.5 million workdays, plus 3.165 million workdays for opening canals, digging ponds, managing mountains, and agricultural production. More than 10,000 laborers in the whole cooperative would need two and a half years to complete the project if they all worked every day; third, the reservoir project would require an investment of 2.1 million yuan, while our total accumulation was only more than 310,000 yuan; in addition, there was also a lack of technical force, and there were many difficulties in the source of materials. Under these circumstances, we deeply felt the difficulty of small cooperative size, less land, and insufficient labor. In the face of large-scale production movements, simply operating advanced cooperatives mainly engaged in agriculture could no longer meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation. Everyone had the demand to merge into large cooperatives, so each advanced cooperative took the initiative to carry out joint cooperatives and merge cooperatives to carry out socialist large-scale cooperation and unite to engage in water conservancy. In the autumn of 1958, Chairman Mao instructed that "People's communes are good." Subsequently, a people's commune integrating government and commune, combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, composed of 27 advanced cooperatives, emerged as the times required.

	The people's commune has great strength, and forcibly reverses the Penghe River

The establishment of the people's commune fundamentally solved the contradictions of small cooperative size, less land, and insufficient labor in the advanced cooperative period, which could not concentrate and uniformly use manpower, material resources, and financial resources, fully demonstrating its strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. Relying on the strength of the people's commune, we realized the ideal of reversing the Penghe River. Under the unified leadership and planning of the people's commune, labor was allocated on a larger scale, and various production brigades were organized to carry out extensive socialist large-scale cooperation, which powerfully promoted the development of water conservancy construction. In particular, the people's commune broadened the horizons of the broad masses of farmers, liberated their minds, greatly improved the masses' enthusiasm for building socialism, and carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and supporting each other. More than a dozen fraternal communes, such as Zhangliang, Yangcun, Zhangguanying, Zongzhuang, and Xinji, and Pingdingshan City, Xiang County, and Ye County, all vigorously supported our Penghe River management project in terms of manpower and materials. In the struggle to manage the Penghe River, more than 1,000 heroic model figures emerged, creating many amazing deeds. For example, the elderly hero Wang Duosan, with his three sons, tamped more than 720 times in one breath and refused to rest. When others persuaded him to rest, he always said: "Happiness is given by the Communist Party and brought about by communization; life is saved by Chairman Mao. How can we be worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao if we do not step up our work?" With the active efforts of the broad masses, the Penghe Reservoir, which can store 59.5 million cubic meters of water, was quickly built. After the reservoir was built, the construction of canals was carried out comprehensively. A Penghe Canal with a length of 30 li running north and south through the entire commune, and a Beida Shahe Leap Forward Canal with a length of 37 li running east and west through the entire commune were completed; 113 branch canals and more than 6,000 bucket, agricultural, and mao canals were dug on both sides of the large canal, forming a systematic irrigation network. When the broad masses saw the Penghe River flowing from east to west with their own eyes, everyone was beaming with joy and smiling. They said in unison: "Only the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the people's commune can make the Penghe River flow backwards." Those who had serious right-leaning conservative ideas, who had predicted in the past: "If the Penghe River can be reversed, unless the sun rises in the west," now have to admit their mistakes and surrender in the face of this ironclad fact.

	Achieve a special great harvest in a year of special severe drought

Due to the realization of water conservancy, we overcame the severe drought since July 1959 and ensured a bumper harvest in agriculture. In the struggle to fight drought and protect the harvest since last year, the Penghe water conservancy project played a huge role, ensuring that 95% of the cultivated land was watered four times and 80% of the cultivated land was watered five times. Therefore, in the severe drought without rain for a hundred days, the agricultural production of the entire commune still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The commune members said: "This year's drought is a special one in the history of Malou, and the agricultural bumper harvest is also a special one in the history of Malou." The single-crop grain yield in autumn reached 529 jin, an increase of 38% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and more than double that of the advanced cooperative in 1957. In 1959, the total grain output of the entire commune reached 59.27 million jin, an increase of 32.9% compared to 1958, and a total of more than 8 million jin of surplus grain was sold to the state throughout the year. Other cash crops also had great increases. The yield per mu of oil crops increased by 33% compared to 1958, the yield per mu of tobacco increased by 48.5%, the yield per mu of cotton increased by 16%, and the average single-crop yield of more than 3,000 mu of rice planted last year was 1,000 jin. The commune members happily said: "The river water flows all over the land, the crops are green and lush, there is no rain for a hundred days, but still a bumper harvest."

	The great development of agriculture has promoted the all-round great leap forward in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and industry

The great development of agriculture in the people's commune has promoted the all-round great leap forward in commune-run industry and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Because agriculture has greatly developed, industry and diversified operations have abundant raw materials, and can develop faster. In 1959, the entire commune successively established ten larger factories, such as machinery, cement, explosives, chemical fertilizer, brick and tile, winemaking, and flour mills, and 22 small factories, such as iron and wood farm tool repair, and weaving. Because all factories have implemented semi-mechanization and mechanization, the labor force invested in commune-run industry in the entire commune has been reduced from the original 1,500 to 800. In 1959, the income plan was completed two months ahead of schedule. In the past year or so, the commune-run machinery factory has manufactured more than 1,800 pieces of advanced tools such as rails, steel sleeves, deep plows, and soil transport machines for agriculture; the cement factory has manufactured more than 560 tons of cement, and the grade has increased from the original 200 to 400; the chemical fertilizer factory has manufactured 170 tons of chemical fertilizer; the brick and tile factory has manufactured 2.5 million bricks and tiles; the explosives factory has manufactured 15,000 jin of explosives. This has greatly supported the rapid development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and accelerated the technical transformation of agriculture. In 1959, the total output value of the commune-owned economy reached 3.77 million yuan, an increase of more than six times compared to 1958, accounting for 54.5% of the total income of the commune. In terms of diversified operations, especially in pig raising, there has been great development. Because we conscientiously implemented the policy of "collective feeding as the main, public and private raising side by side," by January 22 this year, the number of pigs has developed to 80,976, an average of 1.11 per mu, an increase of 9.38 times compared to 7,800 in 1958. This is a phenomenon that has never happened in history. Through pig raising, a large amount of high-quality fertilizer has been accumulated, promoting the great development of agriculture. The accumulation of pig manure increased from an average of 1,510 jin per mu in 1958 to an average of 7,000 jin per mu in 1959, an increase of more than three times. The great development of pig raising has enabled us to receive the effect of more pigs, more fertilizer, more grain, and more money. In addition, the commune's forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also made great progress. The leap forward development of various productions of the people's commune, the continuous expansion of the commune-owned economy, and the continuous increase in public accumulation have powerfully promoted the development of mechanization and electrification. In 1959 alone, our commune added seven tractors, one combine harvester, three seeders, three sets of disc harrows, 20 pot camel machines, diesel engines, and gas engines, seven electric motors, two automobiles, and built three hydroelectric power stations with a power generation of 88 kilowatts. More than 25% of the cultivated land in the entire commune has implemented mechanized cultivation and mechanized sowing; and five brigades have used electric lights, and ten large commune-run factories have used electricity. All of this would not have been possible without the superiorities of the people's commune's large size and high degree of public ownership, and without the strong material strength of the people's commune.

	The all-round great leap forward has enabled six poor teams to catch up with or surpass the rich teams

With the all-round great leap forward of various productions in 1959, not only did the six poor teams in the entire commune catch up with or surpass the rich teams, but also the income of the commune members greatly increased. In 1959, the average income per person in the entire commune was 103 yuan, an increase of 47.8% compared to the average income per person of 69.7 yuan in 1958. With the increase in the income of the commune members, the living standards have also been further improved. In particular, after the people's commune was established, collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens were held, realizing free meals, monthly wages, old people entering nursing homes, children entering nurseries or kindergartens, children entering schools, and various welfare undertakings such as hospitals and maternity hospitals, so that the material and cultural life of the commune members have been greatly improved. Everyone is full of joy, and the enthusiasm for production is even greater.

Comrade representatives, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the happiness brought by the people's commune system to the people of Malou is endless. In order to repay the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao, and in order to build socialism more quickly, all members of our Malou People's Commune are determined to continue to work hard, practically, and skillfully with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and to struggle heroically for the continuous great leap forward in 1960, for the rapid realization of the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and for the realization of a higher level of water conservancy.

专栏：

    马楼今昔
    苏殿选代表谈公社化给马楼人民带来的幸福各位代表、各位同志：
    我热烈拥护李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委所作的各项报告。今天我主要讲一讲公社化给马楼人民带来的幸福。
    马楼人民公社位于河南省鲁山县的东南部，是一个浅山区。全社共有二十个生产大队，四万九千九百多人，七万三千余亩耕地。现在，当人们来到我们的公社，就可以看到在澎山脚下有一座青山环绕的人工湖，这就是公社新修的澎河水库。湖下边有一条澎河大渠，由东向西灌溉着二十余万亩土地。去年国庆节前建成的三座水力发电站，已经使许多农民点上了电灯。公社购买的七部拖拉机，正在日夜进行耕作。我们多年盼望的“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油”的理想已经开始实现了。
      解放前的马楼是：洪水泛滥遭灾殃，肥沃土地变汪洋
    马楼人民公社虽然是一个美丽富饶的好地方，但是，在解放前，由于国民党和地主恶霸的压迫与剥削，加上连年的水旱灾害，广大群众常年过着牛马不如的生活。当时群众中流传着这样两首歌谣：“澎河水湾长又长，洪水泛滥遭灾殃，房屋倒塌千万间，肥沃土地变汪洋”，“天高人心凉，毒蛇缠身上，草根当饭吃，泪水养爹娘。”这就是当时群众生产、生活的真实写照。
    1948年，马楼人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下得到了解放。1949年实行了土地改革。1950年广大农民为了积极发展生产，走共同富裕的道路，开始成立了互助组。1952年建立了初级农业生产合作社，在建社的第二年，小麦单产达到了三百零六斤，比单干户增产一倍还多，这就吸引了更多的农民群众积极要求加入合作社；到1955年上半年，全乡组织了五十二个初级社；1955年冬季农业合作化高潮到来，又由五十二个初级社建成了一个拥有五千多农户参加的高级农业生产合作社。1957年粮食亩产达到六百零三斤，比解放前的1948年增产两倍以上；并且在建立高级社后的第一年，挖了一条五里长的沙河渠，打井三百二十一眼，把全社灌溉面积扩大到一万八千亩，使一部分土地初步实现了水利化。这些生动的事实，有力地证明了农业生产合作社在改造自然、发展生产等方面比个体经济不知优越多少倍。可是，这并没有从根本上改变马楼乡的自然面貌，一遇大旱，渠塘水干，井水降落；一遭多雨，便成涝灾。因此，解决水旱灾害的问题，仍然是广大农民的迫切要求。为了彻底解决这个问题，1957年冬季马楼乡党委作了认真的研究，决心根治澎河，引水由东往西倒流，灌溉马楼乡的土地。经过大战一冬一春，修筑了一座长十五米、宽七米的澎河大坝。按照计划还要修一个能蓄水五千九百万立方米，灌溉二十万亩土地的澎河大水库。这一宏伟的计划得到了广大群众的热烈支持，人人充满了根治澎河的决心和信心。当年全乡共抽出四千五百名劳动力投入了治理澎河的工程。但是，要修澎河水库也暴露出几个问题是我们一个社难以解决的，第一，修澎河水库要占用外社鹅凹大坡等九个村的一千五百多亩土地和二百五十多户的房屋；第二，举办这样大的工程需要二百五十万个劳动日，再加上开渠、挖塘、治山和农业生产需要三百一十六万五千个劳动日，全社一万多个劳动力，按每日全都出勤计算，需要两年半才能完成；第三水库工程需要投资二百一十万元，而我们全社积累只有三十一万多元；此外，技术力量也很缺乏，物资的来源也有很多困难。在这种情况下，我们深深地感觉到社小、地少、劳力不足的困难。在大规模生产运动的面前，单纯的经营以农业为主的高级社，已经不能适应大跃进形势的需要了。大家都有并大社的要求，这样各个高级社便主动地进行联社、并社，进行社会主义大协作，联合起来搞水利。1958年秋季，毛主席指示“人民公社好”，随之，一个由二十七个高级社组成的、工农商学兵相结合的政社合一的人民公社，便应运而生了。
    人民公社力量大，硬叫澎河水倒流
    人民公社一建立，就从根本上解决了高级社时社小、地少、劳力不足，不能集中统一使用人力、物力、财力的矛盾，充分显示了它的强大生命力和无比的优越性。依靠人民公社的力量，我们实现了澎河水倒流的理想。在人民公社的统一领导和计划之下，在更大的范围内调配了劳动力，组织了各个生产大队进行了广泛的社会主义大协作，有力地推动了水利建设的开展。特别是人民公社使广大农民的眼界开阔了，思想解放了，大大提高了群众建设社会主义的积极性，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干和互相支援的共产主义风格。邻近的张良、杨村、张官营、宗庄、辛集等十几个兄弟公社，和平顶山市、襄县、叶县等地，都在人力、物力方面大力支援了我们治理澎河的工程。在治理澎河的斗争中，涌现出了一千多名英雄模范人物，创造了许多惊人的事迹。例如：老年英雄王多三，带着他的三个儿子，一气打夯七百二十多回也不肯休息，当别人劝他休息时，他总是说：“幸福是共产党给的，是公社化带来的；命是毛主席救活的，不加紧干，怎么能对得起共产党和毛主席”。在广大群众的积极努力下，可以蓄水五千九百五十万立方米的澎河大水库很快地就修好了。水库修好之后，紧接着又全面地开展了渠道建设，完成了一条长达三十华里的纵贯全社南北的澎河大渠，和一条三十七华里长的横贯全社东西的北大沙河跃进渠；在大干渠的两旁共挖了一百一十三条支渠，六千余条斗、农、毛渠，形成了一个系统的灌溉网。当广大群众亲眼看到澎河水由东往西倒流时，人人兴高采烈，个个笑逐颜开，他们异口同声地说：“只有共产党、毛主席和人民公社才能使澎河水倒流”。那些有严重右倾保守思想的人们，过去曾预言：“如果能让澎河水倒流，除非西边出日头”，现在面对着这一铁的事实，也不得不认错认输了。
    在特大干旱的一年获得特大的丰收
    由于水利化的实现，我们战胜了1959年7月以来的严重干旱，保证了农业大丰收。在去年以来的抗旱保丰收斗争中，澎河水利工程发挥了巨大的作用，保证了95％的耕地浇水四次，80％的耕地浇水五次，因而在百日无透雨的严重干旱的情况下，全社农业生产仍然获得了空前的大丰收。社员们说：“今年的干旱在马楼历史上是特大的一次，农业大丰收也是马楼历史上特大的一次。”秋季粮食单产达到五百二十九斤，比大跃进的1958年增长38％，比高级社的1957年增长一倍以上。1959年全社粮食总产量达到五千九百二十七万斤，比1958年增长32.9％，全年共卖给国家余粮八百多万斤。其他经济作物也有很大增长。油料作物亩产比1958年增长33％，烟叶亩产增长48.5％，棉花亩产增长16％，去年种植的三千多亩水稻，平均单产一千斤。社员们高兴地说：“河水遍地流，庄稼绿油油，百日无透雨，还是大丰收。”
    农业大发展，促进了林、牧、副、渔、工全面大跃进
    人民公社农业的大发展，促进了社办工业和林、牧、副、渔各业的全面大跃进。因为农业大发展了，工业和多种经营就有了丰富的原料，也就能够更快地发展。1959年全社先后建立了机械、水泥、炸药、化肥、砖瓦、酿酒、面粉等十个较大的工厂，和铁木农具修配、编织等二十二个小型工厂。各个工厂由于都实行了半机械化和机械化，全社投入社办工业的劳动力，由原来的一千五百人减少为八百人，1959年提前两个月完成了收入计划。一年多来社办机械厂为农业制造了轨道、钢套、深翻犁、运土机等先进工具一千八百多件；水泥厂制造出水泥五百六十多吨，标号由原来二百号提高到四百号；化肥厂制造出化肥一百七十吨；砖瓦厂制造出砖瓦二百五十万块；炸药厂制造出炸药一万五千斤。大大地支持了农林牧副渔各业的迅速发展，加速了农业的技术改造。1959年社有经济总产值达三百七十七万元，比1958年增长六倍以上，占公社总收入的54.5％。在多种经营方面，特别是在养猪方面，有了很大的发展。由于我们认真地贯彻执行了“以集体喂养为主，公养私养并举”的两条腿走路的方针，到今年元月22日止，生猪已经发展到八万零九百七十六头，平均一亩地一点一一头，比1958年七千八百头增长九点三八倍，这是历史上从来没有过的现象。通过养猪又积攒了大量的优质肥料，促进了农业的大发展。积猪粪由1958年每亩平均一千五百一十斤，1959年上升为每亩平均七千斤，增长三倍以上。养猪事业的大发展，使我们收到了猪多、肥多、粮多、钱多的效果。此外，公社的林业、牧业、副业、渔业和文教卫生等事业，也都有很大的发展。人民公社各项生产的飞跃发展，社有经济不断扩大，公共积累不断增多，有力地促进了机械化、电气化的发展。1959年一年，我们公社就添置拖拉机七部，联合收割机一部，播种机三部，圆盘耙三组，锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机二十部，电动机七部，汽车两部，并建成了三座水力发电站，发电八十八瓩。全社25％以上的耕地都实行了机耕、机播；并有五个大队使上了电灯，十个大型的社办工厂使用了电力。所有这些，要不是人民公社一大二公的优越性，要不是有人民公社雄厚的物质力量，那是不可能实现的。
      全面大跃进，使六个穷队赶上或超过了富队
    随着1959年各项生产的全面大跃进，不但使全社六个穷队赶上或超过了富队，而且社员的收入也有很大增加。1959年全社每人平均收入一百零三元，比1958年每人平均收入六十九点七元，提高47.8％，社员收入增加了，生活水平也得到了进一步的提高。特别是人民公社化以后，举办了以公共食堂为中心的集体福利事业，实现了吃饭不要钱、按月发工资、老人进了敬老院、孩子进了托儿所或幼儿园、儿童入了学，还有医院、妇产院等各种福利事业，使社员的物质生活和文化生活得到了很大的改善，个个喜气洋洋，生产干劲更大。
    各位代表，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，人民公社制度给马楼人民带来的幸福是说不完的。为了报答党和毛主席的恩情，为了更快地建设社会主义，我们马楼人民公社的全体社员决心以更大的革命干劲，继续苦干、实干、巧干，为实现1960年的持续大跃进，为迅速实现农业的机械化、电气化，实现更高级的水利化，而英勇奋斗。
