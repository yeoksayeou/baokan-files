Buchenwald Concentration Camp

Buchenwald Concentration Camp was established by the Hitler bandits in 1934. It was located in a desolate forest 20 kilometers outside the city of Weimar. It covered an area of five square kilometers and was surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. Inside were dozens of prison cells and various torture chambers, gas chambers, and crematoria. A total of 65,000 people of seventeen nationalities were murdered here by the Nazi bandits. The great leader of the German people, Ernst Thälmann, was also murdered here in August 1944. In 1945, the Soviet army liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp, rescuing more than 80,000 people imprisoned by the Nazis.
