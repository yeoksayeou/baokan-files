Presidium, fellow representatives:

    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. In addition to expressing my intention to implement and execute them in my practical work upon returning, I will now briefly report to the assembly on the struggle of our commune against the extraordinary floods of 1959 and the situation of post-disaster production self-salvation.

    Our Revolutionary October People's Commune was born during the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958. The entire commune has 13,816 households, 68,289 people, and 269,340 mu of land. It stretches seventy li from north to south and forty li from east to west; it is located south of the Bohai Sea, with flat and fertile soil, abundant in grain and various fish and shrimp; it is backed by mountains in the north, with a large number of pears, fruits, and forests, and extremely rich mineral resources.

    The People's Commune, like a rising sun, emitted a brilliant light as soon as it was established. It displayed even greater power than the advanced cooperatives, especially in overcoming natural disasters. Within a year of its establishment, the Revolutionary October People's Commune encountered two droughts, two insect plagues, and one major flood, truly experiencing all five disasters. The largest in scale and most harmful was the drought of 53 days without rain last spring and the great flood of July, which occurred once every 300 years. Without the People's Commune, these disasters would have led to a situation of "hundreds of li of barren land." However, with the People's Commune, with its large organizational scale and wide scope of activity, exerting its tremendous power, these disasters were overcome one by one.

    Enduring the Test of Extraordinary Disasters

    Last spring was the first spring of the People's Commune. Based on the large-scale water conservancy construction, deep plowing of land, and changes in planting high-yield crops such as wheat in 1958, the commune members were preparing for the first abundant spring planting and summer harvest. However, "the heavens did not cooperate," and from April 19th to June 11th, there was no rain for 53 consecutive days, resulting in a major drought in which "the ground smoked, the ponds cracked, the seedlings curled up, and the well bottoms faced the sky."

    In early May, as the tense season for field sowing arrived, the heavens still did not send down a drop of rain. Breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and carrying out drought-resistant planting was an urgent task. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee uniformly led the cadres and masses of the entire commune, debating whether to sit and wait for rain or to resist drought and rush to plant. The commune members unanimously agreed to resist drought and plant, fighting against natural disasters. Thus, a massive and magnificent drought-resistant movement was launched. More than 20,000 people participated in the drought resistance every day, accounting for 92% of the total labor force. At that time, our slogan was: "Block rivers to store water, dig underground springs, ensure full seedlings without rain in the spring, ensure a bumper harvest without rain in the year, rather have shoulders worn out than be rain-waiting idlers."

    The strength, area, and duration of the People's Commune in the fight against drought were all unprecedented. The total area of drought-resistant planting in the commune was more than 104,400 mu, accounting for 59.3% of the total cultivated area. The seedlings planted by water-carrying were generally complete and grew quickly. This was the crystallization of the struggle of thousands of troops against the disaster. In particular, this year's wheat crop throughout the commune, after drought resistance, generally achieved three fertilizers and five waterings, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to the final statistics, the total wheat sown area of the commune was 2,719 city mu, an increase of 2.24 times over the previous year, and an increase of 17 times over the year before that.

    Just as people were celebrating the first summer harvest since communization and looking forward to an even greater harvest in the autumn, a flood disaster that occurs once every 300 years struck. After it started raining on June 12th, it rained for more than 40 consecutive days. In particular, from July 21st to 22nd, on the mountain tops of the Three Mountains in the north of the commune, upstream of the Dafengkou and Gongqing Reservoirs, there was continuous rainfall of 390-420 millimeters within 24 hours, equivalent to two-thirds of the annual rainfall in previous years. Due to the excessive concentration of rainfall, a huge flash flood was triggered. In the gullies more than 100 li behind the Three Mountains, the water flow was rapid, and even millstones were washed away. According to the records on the Dafengkou Reservoir: after 8 o'clock on the 21st, the water level rose rapidly, with the fastest speed reaching 0.2 meters per minute, and the inflow rate reaching 5,705 cubic meters per second. By the morning of the 22nd, the water level greatly exceeded the design level for a once-in-a-century event - 36 million cubic meters of water. Finally, it reached 54 million cubic meters, which finally forced Dafengkou to breach its banks at 4:50 a.m. on the 22nd. Another medium-sized reservoir, the Gongqing Reservoir, also breached its banks at 6:20 a.m. on the 22nd for the same reason. The flood, with a head of water one zhang high, swept from north to south like a wall. Within three hours, unprecedented disasters occurred wherever the flood passed. Many houses were destroyed, and land was submerged.

    The People's Commune is a large socialist collective and family, and in the face of serious disasters, it fully demonstrated the strength of the Party's unified leadership. Before the disaster, the Party and government leaders of the commune went to the dangerous areas along the river and the construction sites of reservoirs to mobilize the masses to prepare for flood prevention and rescue. Many captains of production teams and branch secretaries patrolled back and forth in the villages and along the river all night. In the few minutes before the water situation deteriorated, in addition to notifying the people along the river to escape through broadcasts and telephones, the commune also dispatched a dozen cadres to form four groups to help the people in each team along the river to escape.

    After the flood arrived, the telecommunications between the county, the commune, and the teams within the commune were interrupted. Cadres at all levels and advanced commune members, under the long-term communist ideological education of the Party and in the reality of the People's Commune's big family, highly demonstrated the communist style of selflessness and devotion to the public, and fought tenaciously against the flood. A total of 117 flood-fighting activists emerged throughout the commune, who were praised and rewarded by the masses of the commune. Another 57 activists were praised and materially rewarded by the county.

    Many cadres and masses, unafraid of danger and disregarding their own safety, rescued the collective wealth of the state and the commune. Some cadres sacrificed all their family property, and even their personal lives, for this purpose. For example, He Jingyang (a Communist Party member), the captain of the Caotun Production Team in the Erdao Management District, had already organized the masses to escape danger when the flood reached Caotun. However, when he thought that the team's account books and part of the cash were still in his house, he rushed into his house in the flood without hesitation. He found that the cash and account books were still locked in the desk. He quickly carried the desk to the high slope, but a rapid current washed him away along with the desk. Later, people found this intact desk, but He Jingyang sacrificed his precious life for rescuing public property. Zhang Zhiheng, the director of the Diaoyu Management District, and Dong Yuwen, the branch secretary of the Diaoyu Production Team, also showed similar performances. They urged and directed more than 300 people to run to the mountains beforehand, but when they checked the number of people, they found that five households were missing. So they rushed into the flood separately and rescued the old and young of these five households. At this moment, the flood surged and washed Zhang Zhiheng several zhang away. He relied on a big tree to turn the crisis into safety.

    After leading the masses to evacuate to the mountains, Wang Huiyang, the branch secretary of the Xiaohu Production Team, heard cries for help from the villagers. He excitedly shouted, "Who is brave enough to come with me?" His brother, Wang Huili, the production team leader, hurried to follow. Together they rushed into the village surrounded by floods, carrying one on their shoulders and holding two in their hands, and rescued the entire families of four commune members, a total of 23 people, in the neck-deep flood six times, ensuring that no one was injured or killed among the more than 80 commune members in the entire village.

    In addition to the active rescue work carried out within the commune, the Party and the state also sent planes several times to the severely affected villages and towns, airdropping a large number of biscuits and steamed buns. During the flood, the intense and fierce rescue struggle led by the Communist Party members and commune cadres fully proved that only the people educated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have the spirit of selflessness and devotion to others, and only the superior system of the People's Commune can cultivate such hundreds of selfless heroes. Many cadres, after the disaster, were left with only the clothes on their backs, but they rescued the lives of the whole village and the property of the commune, leaving an unforgettable impression on the commune members. The masses unanimously praised:

   "Without the socialist country led by the Communist Party, how could so many good people be cultivated!"

        Rapidly Eliminating the Traces of the Disaster

    The members of our Revolutionary October People's Commune all said: "Fortunately, we have Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Commune, otherwise, we wouldn't even be able to find the door to beg for food," "We thank the country from the bottom of our hearts, and we thank the People's Commune for its meticulous care and attention to the disaster victims." Under the leadership of the Party and the state, the People's Commune truly used its wide range of activities and strong economic strength, the soaring enthusiasm of "if the east is not bright, the west is bright, if the south is lost, the north is found," and the revolutionary optimism, turning severe disasters into minor disasters, and minor disasters into no disasters, thereby showing that the People's Commune has more vigorous vitality than under favorable conditions, which cannot be done by any other force.

    Our Revolutionary October People's Commune used its powerful organizational forces and economic strength to quickly and properly arrange production and life in the disaster area. From July 22nd, after the disaster occurred, the Commune Party Committee held a meeting on the same night with the participation of relevant departments of the entire commune, and made five resolutions on the work in the disaster area: (1) Quickly mobilize commune members in non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas to voluntarily give up their houses and kang (platform beds) for the commune members whose houses were destroyed to live in, and the rent will be paid by the commune; (2) The problem of food for the disaster victims will be first adjusted by the management area, and if it cannot be solved, it will be adjusted by the commune; (3) Mobilize cadres, workers, and commune members in non-disaster areas to donate clothes and bedding to help the disaster victims; (4) The commune will immediately allocate 13,000 yuan from the public welfare fund to support the disaster victims; (5) Quickly organize the disaster victims and large-scale cooperation in non-disaster areas to drain water, soothe seedlings, and restore normal production order.

    After the resolutions of the Commune Party Committee were issued, a new atmosphere appeared in the disaster area in less than ten days: a total of 1,688 houses were repaired throughout the commune, more than 1,100 homeless commune members all found suitable accommodation and put on clothes, and more than 9,000 people who lost food were fed, and no disaster-stricken commune member went hungry after the disaster. Even the bowls and chopsticks used by the disaster victims for eating were prepared by the commune for them. Therefore, many disaster-stricken commune members said: "The commune is a big family, and this big family takes care of us more thoughtfully than a small family," "I have no home, no relatives, but the commune is my home, and the cadres are my relatives. They care about us so much, I have nothing else to say, only to work hard and rebuild our homes!". The attendance of labor in the disaster area generally exceeded the usual level, and production and life quickly returned to normal order.

    Why did such a miracle happen?

    First of all, from the work of resettling disaster victims, we can see the growth of the spirit of brotherly love in the big family of the People's Commune everywhere. This advanced communist ideology greatly promoted the stability of the thoughts and emotions of the disaster victims. Many cadres and masses who were less affected by the disaster enthusiastically repaired kangs and stoves for the disaster victims, and some gave up their warm kangs for the disaster victims to sleep on, while they themselves slept on plank beds. The Pingfang Team in the Dongpan Management District also organized a window-pasting team, a rice-milling team, a house-cleaning team, and a firewood-collecting team, and hitched up a cart to pick up disaster victims in the Dongpan Production Team. In order to answer the commune's care and concern, they participated in production the next day.

    Secondly, communist large-scale cooperation is not only an effective measure for organizing production in peacetime, but also an effective measure for overcoming disasters. As the saying goes: "One person carries one load, and hundreds of loads pile up into a mountain." After the water receded, there were many things that needed to be done quickly in the disaster area, such as repairing houses, clearing up things, rushing to soothe crops, and planting late rice. It would be very difficult for the disaster victims to do all these things themselves. In order to quickly help the disaster area restore normal production order, the commune vigorously promoted the spirit of cooperation and organized production teams in non-disaster areas to help the disaster areas. The Huangjia Production Team in the Dongpan Management District organized more than 40 people with dry food on the second day after the water receded to go to the Dongpan Production Team to repair houses, dig out grain, and other materials, and worked continuously for five or six days. The two major irrigation canals in the Liangshui, Qianwei, and Sanshan Management Districts were silted up by floods, and 6,000 mu of paddy fields were cut off from water, and the rice was threatened with death. These two canals were very large, and it would take five or six thousand workers to completely repair them. It would be difficult for only a few beneficiary teams (the former advanced cooperatives) to complete such a large project in a short period of time. The commune and these three management districts organized and mobilized the beneficiary teams and non-beneficiary teams to repair them together. As a result, it only took a day and a half to repair the canals that were dozens of li long, and the water flowed continuously into the paddy fields. The broad masses of commune members deeply felt that without the People's Commune and large-scale cooperation, they would have to watch the rice die from drought.

    Thirdly, the commune's industrial, commercial, and school departments, under the unified leadership and mobilization of the commune, also enthusiastically supported the disaster area. The iron factory and the woodworking factory immediately switched from other production to the production of daily necessities according to the needs of the disaster victims. The workers worked day and night to process scissors, dining tables, pot lids, and other daily necessities for the disaster victims. The commercial department also immediately sent people to the disaster area to investigate the needs of materials after the disaster and organized purchases. The students were on vacation during the flood. In order to exert even the slightest strength to resist the disaster, the school teachers also led the students to participate in soothing seedlings and pulling out weeds. This is another large-scale cooperation of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in the commune.

    Finally, and also the most important reason, the People's Commune is led by our great socialist country. In addition to the commune's allocation of funds and grain and mutual assistance among the commune members, the Party and the state, and the people of the whole province, were very concerned about the disaster situation and the post-disaster recovery work in this area. A delegation led by the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee came to express their condolences, and at the same time, they supported the masses in the disaster area with a large amount of materials and cash. The relief fund allocated by the state amounted to more than 60,000 yuan, and more than 50,000 pieces of clothing. The severely affected people who were washed away by the flood and were destitute changed their homes a few days later. On average, each of the more than 2,000 disaster-stricken households in the commune received four pieces of clothing, and severely affected households received about ten pieces. Ma Shucheng, a member of the Diaoyu Production Team, originally had only one set of old cotton clothes and single clothes for each member of his family. After the flood, his family had more clothes than before, with an average of three or four sets of single clothes per person, and two sets of cotton clothes per person. He said: "The Communist Party is really incomparable, even buying cloth and making clothes ourselves would not be so fast!"

    The production and living order of the masses in the disaster area quickly returned to normal, and the socialist consciousness of the cadres and masses in the disaster area was generally improved through the disaster relief struggle. As a result, bad things turned into good things, and a new situation of unprecedented unity between cadres and masses, and between people, emerged. Everyone was in a good mood and full of spirit. The disaster victims said: "The commune cadres are so desperate, we can only do a good job in production to be worthy of them." The masses of the Beiyinzhang Production Team said to the cadres: "You can think boldly, as long as you think carefully, we will do whatever you say."

    Many elderly commune members who had crawled out of the hard times of the old society have a deep understanding of the sharp contrast between the old and new societies. This area has experienced three major floods in the past 100 years. Many old commune members compared the disaster last year with the flood and drought disasters in the 20th year of Guangxu and the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930) and said that without the People's Commune, even the Heavenly King Laozi would not be able to withstand such a major disaster. According to the recollection of old farmers in this township, in the years after the disasters in the 20th year of Guangxu and the 19th year of the Republic of China, the phenomenon of "seven mores" generally appeared in this township: more people fleeing famine, more debts, more hired laborers, more beggars, more child brides, more sales of children, and more suicides. According to the incomplete statistics based on their recollections: in the 20th year of Guangxu alone, more than 70 people committed suicide by hanging in this township, 17 households sold their children, 266 households begged for food, 267 child brides, 330 households fled famine, 2,700 households were hired laborers, and the masses in this township, except for a few landlords and rich peasants, generally suffered from hunger and cold, were heavily indebted, and sold land. About 1,330 people. And those two major floods were not as big as this flood disaster.

    The government at that time watched many poor peasants freeze to death, starve to death, and commit suicide without any concern. They said with emotion: such a society is really not found even with lanterns in the past!

    After the disaster, the Commune Party Committee and the Commune Management Committee, based on the plans for rebuilding their homes generally formulated by the production teams, initially determined the commune's plan for rebuilding their homes and saving themselves through production. We put forward the slogan of "turning disaster years into bumper years, reducing production without reducing income, doing a good job in self-salvation through production, and rebuilding a happy home."

    In order to realize this leap-forward plan, the entire commune launched a production increase and conservation movement of "four losses and four finds." Determined to turn disaster years into bumper years, reducing production without reducing income. "Four losses and four finds" are: loss of agriculture, find sideline occupations; loss of early autumn, find late autumn; loss of dry land, find paddy fields; loss of grain, find fruits. According to this policy, a vigorous production upsurge was set off throughout the commune, and the autumn harvest work progressed rapidly. In addition to the autumn harvest work, sideline production was in full swing, and the output value of sideline production throughout the commune exceeded two times by the end of the year. In terms of sowing late autumn crops, autumn fallow land was basically eliminated.

    Although the grain production of the entire commune last year was reduced due to the extraordinary disaster, due to the careful management of the late autumn fields by the commune members, a scene of bumper rice harvests appeared in our commune. The local people sang: the commune is praised by everyone, and large-scale water conservancy is carried out; dry land is changed into paddy fields, and one year is worth three years. Pears and fruits in the hilly areas generally reported bumper harvests, with the average yield of the entire commune increasing by one and a half times compared with 1958, reaching a record high that had never been seen in history.

    It is precisely because the People's Commune has unparalleled superiority that although a large area of farmland was reduced in yield and some farmland yielded no grain at all last year, the total income of agriculture and sideline production of the entire commune still reached 5.28 million yuan by the end of the year. Due to the commune's universal implementation of the movement to practice strict economy and careful calculation, the average share per commune member, excluding household sideline income, was 230 yuan per household and about 50 yuan per person. This income level not only exceeded the bumper harvest of 1957, but also exceeded the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

    The Commune Party Committee and the Commune Management Committee, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to "oppose rightism, boost morale, and launch a production increase and conservation movement," formulated a long-term construction plan. Within two or three years, the entire commune will greatly develop the cropping system of two crops of rice and wheat a year to gradually change the main grain varieties; the northern mountainous area will be planted with fruit trees and shelterbelts to change the old appearance of mountains and rivers; the central sandy area will be planted with a large number of cash crops such as cotton and peanuts to support national industrialization; and the southern coastal fishery will also have great development. Commune members described the future prospects as: the bald mountains of the past become green tops, blocking floods and discharging clear springs, tens of thousands of hectares of good land are transformed into garden fields, water and power stations are everywhere, the breeze blows the rice waves rolling, the cotton spits out silver light, looking down at the foot of the mountain to open treasure mines, terraces and orchards everywhere, factories, shops, theaters, universities, hospitals are all complete, the People's Commune is very good, happy life is forever.

    In order to win an even greater harvest in 1960, according to the spirit of the Commune Party Committee's resolution, since the beginning of last winter, a magnificent and vigorous construction upsurge centered on water, fertilizer, and soil has been launched on a wide scale throughout the commune. 60% of the labor force has been put on the water conservancy front. In addition to reconstructing two medium-sized water conservancy projects (completed within two years), we are building large reservoirs, digging springs and wells, and digging clear water, so that not a drop of water is lost. As of now, a total of 1,009 large and small water conservancy projects have been completed, which can irrigate 8,000 hectares of land, accounting for more than 50% of the total cultivated area. The quantity and quality of fertilization are also higher than in previous years. In addition, 1,442 agricultural tools and 674 other tools have been reformed, thereby solving the difficulty of insufficient labor. This has laid the foundation for realizing the continued Great Leap Forward this year. Even so, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, hold high the red banner of Chairman Mao's thought, and forge ahead bravely on the road to victory!

专栏：

    真金不怕火炼
    刘洪达代表谈革命十月人民公社是怎样战胜特大灾害的主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常委会工作报告。除表示回去在实际工作中贯彻执行外，现在把我们公社在1959年的特大洪水面前搏斗和灾后生产自救情况向大会作一简单汇报。
    我们革命十月人民公社是在1958年农业大跃进中诞生的，全社拥有一万三千八百一十六户，六万八千二百八十九口人，二十六万九千三百四十亩土地。南北七十华里，东西四十华里；南靠渤海，地平土肥，盛产粮食和各种鱼虾，北靠群山，有大量的梨果和森林，矿藏资源极为丰富。
    人民公社一成立，就像初升的太阳一样，发出了灿烂的光芒。特别是在战胜自然灾害方面显示了比高级社更大的威力。革命十月人民公社建立之后不到一年，就连续碰到了两次旱灾，两次虫灾，一次大水灾，真是五灾俱全。其中规模最大、危害最烈的要算去年春天的五十三天无雨的旱灾和7月份的三百年一遇的大水灾。要是没有人民公社，这些灾害，就会出现“赤地百里”的局面，然而，有了组织规模大、活动范围广的人民公社，发挥了它巨大的威力，就先后一个一个地战胜了这些灾害。
    经受了特大灾害的考验
    去年春天是人民公社第一个春天。社员们在1958年大修水利，深翻土地，改种小麦等高产作物的基础上，正准备进行第一个丰盛的春种夏收。可是“天公不作美”，从4月19日到6月11日，先后五十三天没有下雨，造成了“地冒烟，塘裂嘴，禾苗卷叶，井底朝天”的大旱灾。
    5月初，大田播种的紧张季节来到时，天老爷仍然不下一滴雨，破除迷信，解放思想，抗旱播种是刻不容缓的任务。于是公社党委统一领导全社干部群众，辩论了还是坐等下雨、还是抗旱抢种的问题。社员一致同意抗旱播种，和自然灾害作战。于是一个声势浩大，规模壮阔的抗旱运动就开展起来了。全社每天参加抗旱人数达二万多人，占总劳力的92％。当时我们的口号是：“挡河蓄水，挖掘地下泉，一春无雨保全苗，一年无雨保丰收，宁肯肩磨烂，不做等雨汉”。
    人民公社从事抗旱斗争的力量如此之大，面积如此之广，时间如此之长，都是史无前例的。全社抗旱播种的面积十万四千四百多亩，占总耕地面积的59.3％。坐水播种的小苗普遍出的齐，长的快。这是千军万马抗灾的结晶，特别是今年全社的小麦，经过抗旱，普遍作到三肥五水，获得了空前的丰收。据最后统计，全社小麦播种面积共二千七百一十九市亩，比上年增加二点二四倍，比前年更增加十七倍之多。
    正当人们欢庆公社化后的第一个夏季大丰收，期望着秋季更大丰收的时候，降来了一场三百年一遇的洪水灾害，从6月12日开始下雨以后，一连下了四十多天雨，特别是7月21日至22日，在公社北部的三山山头上，大风口、共青二水库上游，在二十四小时之内连续降雨三百九十——四百二十毫米，相当于往年全年的降雨量三分之二。由于雨量过分集中，引起了巨大的山洪暴发，在三山背后一百多里的山沟内水流湍急，连碾盘都冲走了，据大风口水库上的记载：21日八点后，水位迅速上涨，最快速度每分钟达零点二米，每秒进水量达五千七百零五公方，至22日晨，水位大大超过了百年一遇的设计水平——三千六百万方水。最后达到五千四百万方，终于迫使大风口于22日晨四时五十分漫堤决口。另一座中型水库——共青水库也因同样的原因，于22日晨六时二十分决口。洪水以一丈高的水头，由北向南，像一堵墙似的席卷过来。三个小时之内，洪水所经之处，都出现空前未有过的大灾难。许多房屋被冲毁了，土地被淹了。
    人民公社是一个社会主义的大集体、大家庭，在严重的灾害面前，充分表现了党的统一领导的坚强。在受灾之前，公社的党、政领导同志都分赴沿河险区、水库工地，发动群众做好防汛抢险准备工作，许多生产队的队长、支部书记都通夜在村里和沿河来回巡察，在水情恶化的前几分钟，公社除通过广播和电话通知沿河群众逃险以外，又抽调了十几名干部组成四个组，分别到沿河各队帮助群众抢险脱险。
    洪水到来之后，中断了县、社和社内各队之间的电讯交通联系，各级干部和先进的社员在党的长期的共产主义思想教育和公社大家庭的现实情况下，高度表现了舍己为人，大公无私的共产主义风格，和洪水进行了顽强的搏斗，全社共涌现出一百一十七名抗洪积极分子，得到全社群众的赞扬和奖励，还有五十七名积极分子，受到县里的表扬和物质奖励。
    许多干部、群众临危不惧，奋不顾身地抢救国家和公社的集体财富。有的干部为此而牺牲了自己家里的一切财物，甚至牺牲个人的生命。例如二道管理区曹屯生产队队长何景阳（共产党员），当洪水到曹屯的时候，他已经组织了群众脱离险境，可是当他想到队里的账册和一部分现金还在他家里，他又毫不犹豫地冲进洪水中的家屋，发现现金和账册还锁在桌子里，他连忙扛起办公桌向高坡冲去，可是一个急流把他连人带桌都冲走了。事后人们找到了这张完整无损的办公桌，而何景阳却为抢救公物牺牲了宝贵的生命。钓鱼管理区主任张志恒和钓鱼生产队支部书记董玉文也有同样的表现，他们连夜督促和指挥三百多群众事先跑上了山头，可是在查点人数时又发现少了五户，于是他们又分头冲进洪水，救出了这五户的老小。正在这时，洪水猛涨，把张志恒冲到几丈之外，他依靠一棵大树才转危为安。
    小胡生产队支部书记王会阳在领导群众撤到山头上之后，听到村里群众还有呼救之声。他激动地高喊：“那个胆大的跟我去。”他的亲兄弟、生产组长王会礼就赶忙跟上，他们一起冲进了洪水包围的村屯，肩驮一个，手夹两个，先后在没脖子洪水中往返六次救出了四户社员的全家老少共二十三口，使全村八十多个社员无一伤亡。
    除公社内积极进行的抢救工作而外，党和国家还数次派飞机到各重灾村屯，空投了大量的饼干和窝窝头。在洪水过程中，以共产党员、公社干部为首的紧张激烈的抢险斗争，充分证明了只有共产党毛主席教育出来的人民，才有舍己为人的精神，只有人民公社的优越制度，才能培育出这样数以百计的大公无私的英雄人物。许多干部在灾情过后，自己只剩下一身衣裤，却抢救了全村的人命和公社的财产，给社员留下了终身难忘的印象，群众一致称颂说：
  “没有共产党领导的社会主义国家，哪能培养出这么多好人来！”
        迅速消灭了灾痕
    我们革命十月人民公社的社员都说：“幸亏有了毛主席，共产党和人民公社，不然真是要饭也摸不着大门”，“我们从心底里感谢国家，感谢人民公社对灾民体贴入微的关怀和照顾。”人民公社在党和国家领导下，确实运用了它广大的活动范围和雄厚的经济力量，“东方不亮西方亮，丢了南方有北方”的冲天干劲和革命乐观主义精神，使重灾变成轻灾，轻灾变无灾，从而使人民公社显示了比环境顺利的条件下更加旺盛的生命力，这都是任何别的力量所不能做到的。
    我们革命十月人民公社运用它强大的组织力量和经济力量，迅速进行着灾区生产、生活的妥善安排。从7月22日灾情发生后，公社党委当晚就召开了全社有关部门参加的会议，对灾区工作做出了五条决议：（1）迅速动员非灾区、轻灾区的社员主动让房让炕，供冲倒房屋的社员居住，房租由社付给；（2）灾民的吃饭问题，首先由管理区调剂，解决不了的由社调剂；（3）动员干部、职工和非灾区社员捐献衣服、被褥，救济灾民；（4）公社从公益金中立即拨出一万三千元，支援灾民；（5）迅速组织灾民和非灾区的大协作，排水抚苗，恢复正常的生产秩序。
    公社党委的决议发出之后，不到十天，灾区就出现了一番新气象：全社修复的房屋共达一千六百八十八间，一千一百多户无家可归的社员，全部找到了适当的住所，穿上了衣服，九千多失去口粮的人吃饱了肚子，从来没有一个受灾社员在灾后挨饿，连灾民吃饭用的碗筷，也有不少是公社给他们预备。因此，许多受灾社员说：“公社是个大家庭，这个大家庭比小家庭还照顾得周到”，“我没有家，没有了亲人，可是，公社就是我的家，干部就是我的亲人，他们这样关心我们，我没有别的说的，只有一个干字，重建家园！”。灾区劳动力出勤普遍超过平时，生产生活迅速恢复了正常的秩序。
    为什么会出现这样的奇迹呢？
    首先从灾民安置工作中，我们到处可以看到人民公社大家庭内兄弟般的友爱精神的成长，这种先进的共产主义思想大大促进了灾民思想情绪的稳定。许多受灾较轻的干部群众热情地为灾民修炕补灶，有的把热炕头倒给灾民睡，自己睡在板床上。东潘管理区平房队还组织了糊窗组、磨米组、打扫屋子组、齐柴禾组，并套起大车去东潘生产队接灾民，他们为回答公社的照顾和关怀，第二天就参加了生产。
    其次，共产主义大协作，不仅是平时组织生产的有效措施，也是战胜灾害的有效措施之一。俗语说：“一人担一担，百担堆成山”。水过后灾区有许多事要火速作好，如修房子、扒东西，抢抚庄稼，种晚田，这些活计，如果全部由灾民自己来做是有很多困难的。公社为了迅速帮助灾区恢复正常的生产秩序，大兴协作之风，组织非灾地区各生产队帮助灾区。东潘管理区黄家生产队在水退后的第二天，就组织了四十多个人带着干粮，到东潘生产队整房子、挖粮食和其它物资，一连干了五、六天。凉水、前卫、三山管理区，两条输水大干渠被洪水淤平了，六千亩水田断了水，水稻受着枯死的威胁。这两条干渠很大，要完全修复得用五、六千个工，这么大的工程，只靠几个受益队（过去的高级社）在短时期内完成是有困难的。公社和这三个管理区组织发动了受益队和非受益队共同修复，结果只花了一天半的时间就修复了几十华里长的干渠，水源源不断地流进了稻田。广大社员都深深地感到：要没有人民公社和大协作，就得眼瞅着水稻被干死。
    再次，公社的工业、商业部门、学校，在公社统一领导和调动下，也都充满热情地支援灾区。铁工厂、木器厂根据灾民的需要，立即由其它生产转入生活用品生产。工人们都昼夜不停地为灾民加工剪刀、饭桌、锅盖等生活用具，商业部门也立即派人前往灾区调查灾后的物资需要情况，组织进货。学校学生在水灾期间，正逢假期。为了发挥那怕是微小的力量抗击灾害，学校教师也带领着学生参加了抚苗拔大草等。这又是公社工农兵学商的大协作。
    最后也是一个最重要的原因，领导人民公社前进的是我们伟大的社会主义国家，除了公社拨款、拨粮和社员之间互助互济以外，党和国家、全省人民都非常关怀这个地区的灾情和灾后的恢复工作，以省委书记、市委书记为首的慰问团前来慰问，同时，还以大量的物资和现款支援了灾区群众。国家拨给的救济款达六万元之多，衣服五万多件。被水灾冲的一贫如洗的重灾民，几天以后家里就变了样。全社二千多户灾民平均每人得到四件衣服，重灾户在十件左右。钓鱼生产队社员马树成，原先全家平均每人只有一套旧棉衣和随身穿的单衣，水灾过后，他家衣服倒比过去多了，平均每人三、四套单衣，每人还得了两套棉衣。他说：“共产党真没有比的，就是自己买布做也没有这么快呀！”
    灾区群众的生产、生活秩序迅速恢复了正常，灾区干部、群众通过抗灾斗争，社会主义觉悟普遍地得到提高，结果坏事变成了好事，出现了干部和群众、人与人之间空前的团结，人人心情舒畅，人人精神饱满的新局面。灾民们说：“公社干部这样舍死忘生的，我们只有搞好生产，才能对得起他们”。背阴章生产队的群众对干部说：“你们大胆的想吧，只要你们想得周到，你们说什么我们就干什么。”
    许多从旧社会中艰苦岁月中爬过来的老年社员对新旧社会的鲜明对比有深刻的体会。这个地区百年以来共发过三次大水。许多老社员拿去年灾情和光绪二十年、民国十九年的水旱灾害情况对比之后说，要没有人民公社，天王老子也抗不住这样的大灾。据本乡老农回忆，光绪二十年、民国十九年灾后，本乡都曾普遍出现“七多”：逃荒多、欠债多、扛活多、讨饭多、童养媳多、卖儿卖女多、寻死上吊多。根据他们的回忆所进行的不完全统计：仅光绪二十年，本乡上吊寻死共七十多人，卖儿女的十七户，讨饭的二百六十六户，童养媳二百六十七人，逃荒的三百三十多户，扛活的二千七百多户，除少数地主富农外，本乡群众普遍挨饿受冻，负债累累，出卖土地的约有一千三百三十多人。而那两次大水都还没有这次洪水灾害大呢。
    当时的政府眼看着许多贫苦农民冻死、饿死、上吊也毫不关心。他们感动的说：这样的社会，真是从前打灯笼也找不到的啊！
    灾后，公社党委和社管理委员会在各生产队普遍拟定的重建家园计划的基础上，初步确定了全社的重建家园、生产自救的规划。我们提出“灾年变丰年，减产不减收，搞好生产自救，重建幸福家园”的口号。
    为了实现这个跃进的规划，全社开展了“四丢四找”的增产节约运动。决心要把灾年变丰年，减产不减收。“四丢四找”即农业丢副业找；早秋丢晚秋找；旱田丢水田找；粮食丢果上找。根据这一方针，全社掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产高潮，秋收工作进展很快。除秋收工作之外，副业生产搞得热火朝天，全社的副业产值到年底已超过两倍。在播种晚秋作物方面，基本消灭了秋闲地。
    去年全社的粮食生产虽因遭遇特大灾害，但是由于社员对晚秋田的精心管理，我们公社还出现了水稻丰收景象。当地群众唱道：公社人人夸，大搞水利化；旱田改水田，一年顶三年。丘陵地区的梨果，更普告丰收，全社平均比1958年增产一倍半，达到历史上从未有过的高产纪录。
    正因为人民公社有无比优越性，去年虽然大片农田减收，部分农田颗粒无收，到年底全社农副业总收入还达五百二十八万元。由于公社普遍地开展了厉行节约运动，精打细算的结果，不算家庭副业收入平均每户社员分二百三十元，每人平均五十元左右。这个收入水平，既超过丰收的1957年，也超过了大跃进的1958年。
    公社党委和社管理委员会在党的八届八中全会“反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动”的精神鼓舞下，拟定了长远的建设规划，两三年内，全社要大量发展稻麦两熟的耕作制度，以逐渐改变主粮品种；北部山区将遍种果树和防护林带，改变山河旧貌；中部沙土地区，将大量种植棉花、花生等经济作物，支援国家工业化；南部沿海渔业也将有很大发展。社员形容今后的远景将是：昔日秃山变绿顶，拦住洪水泻清泉，万垧良田园田化，到处水力电力站，微风吹动稻浪滚，棉花吐絮银光闪，俯首山脚开宝矿，到处梯田百果园，工厂、商店、影剧院、大学、医院样样全，人民公社好得很，幸福生活万万年。
    我们为了夺得1960年更大丰收，根据公社党委决议精神，从去年入冬以来，在全社范围内广泛的开展起规模壮阔、轰轰烈烈的、以水肥土为中心的建设高潮。水利战线上就投放了60％的劳动力，除进行复建两座中型水利工程（二年内竣工）外，大兴水库，挖泉打井和挖明水，作到滴水不流失。截至目前为止，共完成大小水利工程一千零九个，可灌溉土地八千垧，占总耕地面积50％强。施肥的数量和质量也都高于往年。并且还改革农具一千四百四十二件，其他工具六百七十四件。从而解决了劳动力不足的困难。给实现今年的继续大跃进奠定了基础。虽然如此，我们还要以不断革命的精神，高举毛主席的思想红旗，在胜利的道路上奋勇前进！
