    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, representing all Chinese youth and students, to express their firmest support for the heroic struggle launched by the broad masses of people and youth students in ten cities including Seoul, Busan, and Masan in South Korea against the Lee Seung-man puppet regime and its fascist rule, backed by U.S. imperialism.
    The telegram stated that the U.S. imperialist policy of insisting on dividing Korea and long-term occupation of South Korea, as well as the fascist rule of the Lee Seung-man clique under the protection of American bayonets, has turned South Korea into a living hell. The large-scale struggle launched by the youth students and the broad masses of the people of South Korea is just. It is a total eruption of their long-standing resentment and resistance against the U.S.-Lee group, and no force can stop it.
    The telegram stated that facts have repeatedly proven that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Korean people and the people of the world. Only by driving U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and overthrowing the Lee Seung-man traitorous group can the South Korean people gain freedom and liberation, and can the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland be realized.
    The telegram concluded by saying that we express our utmost anger and solemn condemnation of the Lee Seung-man group's bloody crime of using American tanks and guns to massacre the South Korean uprising people. The sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in the world are on the side of the Korean people. We firmly believe that although the road of struggle will have twists and turns, victory will surely belong to the united and persevering South Korean people and youth students. The Korean people and youth students' struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

    我全国青联学联致电
    声援南朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    新华社22日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天致电朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会，代表全中国青年和学生，对南朝鲜汉城、釜山、马山等十个城市的广大人民和青年学生为反对美帝国主义支持下的李承晚傀儡政权和法西斯统治而展开的英勇斗争表示最坚决的支持。
    电报说，美帝国主义坚持分裂朝鲜和长期霸占南朝鲜的侵略政策、以及在美国刺刀庇护下的李承晚集团的法西斯统治，已经把南朝鲜变成人间地狱。南朝鲜的青年学生和广大人民一起所掀起的声势浩大的斗争是正义的，是他们长期以来对美李集团的愤恨和反抗的总爆发，是任何力量都无法阻挡的。
    电报说，事实一再证明，美帝国主义是朝鲜人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，只有美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜，打倒李承晚卖国集团，才能使南朝鲜人民获得自由和解放，才能实现朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的愿望。
    电报最后说，我们对李承晚集团用美国坦克和枪炮来屠杀南朝鲜起义人民的血腥罪行，表示无比的愤怒和严正的谴责。全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持都在朝鲜人民的一边。我们坚信，尽管斗争的道路还会有曲折，但胜利一定属于团结起来和坚持斗争的南朝鲜人民和青年学生。朝鲜人民和青年学生争取祖国和平统一的斗争必将获得最后胜利。
