Studying Mao Zedong Thought and Strengthening Self-Remolding
Speech by Committee Member Xiong Bingkun

I was very pleased to hear the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, the report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960, the report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. I express my complete agreement, wholeheartedly support them, and will actively contribute my share to their realization.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Great Leap Forward continued in 1959. We only spent two years to complete and overfulfill the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the national economy. It is expected that there will be a greater leap forward in 1960, and it is firmly believed that a sustained Great Leap Forward will continue for a long time to come, and it is very possible to catch up with and surpass the production level of the United Kingdom within ten years. Such a high rate of development of social productive forces is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. Why is there such a high rate of development? This is because under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in the mass movement of 650 million people, three magic weapons were creatively produced: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

The General Line concentrates the strong will of the 650 million people to build socialism to rapidly change the backward state of poverty and blankness. The purpose of the Chinese people who have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the three major enemies for a long time is not only to seek liberation politically, but more importantly, to urgently demand the rapid construction of a socialist economy in order to get rid of the original backward state economically. The General Line's policy of "walking on two legs" with five things done simultaneously best combines our objective possibilities with our subjective initiative. It is suitable for the objective laws of China's high-speed and proportionate economic development and can maximize all our potential strengths. Because China's New Democratic Revolution and Socialist Revolution have been carried out thoroughly, and the established socialist system is incomparably superior, we have continuously achieved major victories on the economic, ideological, and political fronts, so we can constantly resolve the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base, and constantly reform the relations of production to adapt to the leap-forward development of productive forces. More importantly, China has the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and constantly absorbs the international experience of socialism and summarizes its own domestic experience, so as to formulate policies and lines that are in line with China's conditions for us. There is also the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the mutual support of the socialist international community. As a result, the industrious and brave Chinese people, after liberating their minds and raising their political consciousness, have become the most active factor in the productive forces, and can continue to use the Great Leap Forward to utilize China's rich underground resources to develop heavy industry at high speed, and to use China's vast temperate and subtropical good climatic conditions to develop agriculture and light industry at high speed. We not only have the correct political and economic lines of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, but also the best grassroots organizational form for implementing this line, which is the People's Commune. The People's Commune is a large and public collective, which facilitates the division of labor, facilitates unified arrangement and allocation of labor, not only engages in agriculture but also engages in industry, and combines agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and integrates industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, making the government and the commune one, organizing both production and life, and having endless vitality. It is itself developing, and is also suitable for the transition to ownership by the whole people and the transition to communism. The great achievements of the two years of the Great Leap Forward prove that these three magic weapons have played a huge role in China's socialist construction, and its invincibility is of international significance.

Imperialists and reactionary elements dependent on imperialism ridicule our "Great Leap Backward," slander us for "forced labor without freedom," fabricate "communist threats," and use problems left over by imperialism to provoke relations between China and neighboring countries. Facts speak louder than words. In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the total industrial output value has increased by more than double, and the total agricultural output value has increased by nearly half. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people is soaring because the fruits of labor are entirely used for the working people, and because the working people have the communist style of catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, cooperating with each other, and improving together. We have verified the superiority of both democracy and centralism, and the authenticity of freedom and discipline. The so-called freedom of capitalism is deceptive and has been increasingly recognized by the working people. We do not need to invade other countries, do not need to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and only need to coexist peacefully with countries with different social systems and build our own country in a peaceful environment. The agreements recently signed between China and Indonesia, China and Myanmar, and China and Nepal have repeatedly exposed the imperialists' conspiracies. Imperialism is making a deathbed struggle, and we must continue to be vigilant and continue to strive for peace together with the people of the world.

Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we have continuously achieved victories in building socialism at home and victories in striving for peace internationally. Therefore, we must continue to study Mao Zedong Thought in depth, continue to strengthen self-remolding, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, rely on the leadership of the Party, listen to the Party, follow the Party, and strive for greater and more victories.

### 学习毛泽东思想　加强自我改造  熊秉坤委员的发言

    学习毛泽东思想　加强自我改造
    熊秉坤委员的发言
    我听了关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告、关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而斗争的报告，以及政协常委会的工作报告，感到非常高兴。我表示完全同意，衷心拥护，并为其实现而积极贡献自己一分力量。
    在1958年的大跃进基础上，1959年继续了大跃进，我们只花了两年的时间，就完成和超额完成了第二个五年的国民经济计划指标，预料1960年将有更大的跃进，深信今后将会长期持续大跃进，而在十年内赶上和超过英国的生产水平是很有可能的。像这样高速度地发展社会生产力，是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。为什么有这样高的发展速度呢？这是因为在党中央、毛主席的领导下，在六亿五千万人民群众运动中，创造性地产生了三大法宝：总路线、大跃进和人民公社。
    总路线集中体现了六亿五千万人民建设社会主义以迅速改变一穷二白的落后面貌的坚强意志。长期遭受三大敌人压迫剥削的中国人民，其革命的目的，不仅是在政治上求解放，更重要的是在经济上迅速建成社会主义经济以摆脱原有落后面貌的迫切要求。总路线的五个并举两条腿走路的方针，把我们的客观可能性与主观能动性最好地结合起来了，适合我国经济高速度按比例发展的客观规律，能够尽量发挥我们的一切潜在力量。由于我国的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命进行得很彻底，所建立的社会主义制度无比优越，在经济战线上，思想战线上和政治战线上连续的取得了重大胜利，所以我们能够不断地解决上层建筑与经济基础的矛盾，能够不断地改革生产关系以适应生产力的飞跃发展。更重要的是我国有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，经常吸取社会主义的国际经验和总结自己的国内经验，为我们来制定合乎我国情况的方针政策和路线。还有苏联的无私援助、社会主义国际的相互支援。于是勤劳勇敢的中国人民在解放了思想提高了政治觉悟后，更形成了生产力中最活跃的因素，能够持续以大跃进的步伐，来利用我国丰富的地下蕴藏以高速度发展重工业，来利用我国广大的温带亚热带的良好气候条件以高速度发展农业和轻工业。我们不但有总路线大跃进这样正确的政治经济路线，而且有执行这个路线的最好的基层组织形式，就是人民公社。人民公社是一个大而公的集体，它便于分工，便于统一安排、调配劳动力，不单搞农业也搞工业，并把农林牧副渔，工农商学兵结合起来而使政社一体，既组织生产又组织生活，有无穷无尽的生命力。它本身又是发展的，也适合于向全民所有制的过渡与向共产主义的过渡。两年大跃进的伟大成就，证明这三个法宝对我国的社会主义建设，发挥了巨大的作用，并且它的无往而不胜利是具有国际意义的。
    帝国主义者及依附帝国主义的反动分子，讥笑我们“大跃退”，诬蔑我们“强迫劳动没有自由”，?造“共产主义威胁”，并利用帝国主义遗留下来的问题来挑拨中国和邻国的关系。事实胜于雄辩，两年的大跃进，工业总产值增长一倍多，农业总产值增长近半倍。我国人民的干劲冲天，是因为劳动的果实完全用之于劳动人民，是因为劳动人民具有赶先进、帮后进、大家协作、共同提高的共产主义风格。我们验证了既民主又集中的优越性，有自由有纪律的真实性。资本主义的所谓自由是骗人的，已经日益为劳动人民所认识。我们不需要侵犯别的国家，不需要干涉别国内政，只需要在不同社会制度的国家中和平共处，在和平环境中来建设自己的国家。最近中国印尼、中缅、中尼所签订的协议，就多次揭穿了帝国主义的阴谋诡计。帝国主义是要作垂死挣扎的，我们必须和世界人民一起继续保持警惕，继续争取和平。
    在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们不断地取得在国内建设社会主义的胜利，在国际争取和平的胜利，因此，我们仍须继续深入地学习毛泽东思想，继续加强自我改造，用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，依靠党的领导，听党的话，跟着党走，以争取更大更多的胜利。
