    Seeing the Whole Country from Hongduogou
    Gu Ming
    After reading the "Party Secretary's Notes: Cultural Flowers Bloom All Over Hongduogou," I was deeply moved and excited. Look, in a village that was historically illiterate, a place where "only a few people could read, and when relatives and friends received a letter, they had to seek someone to read it for them miles away," after the leadership of the Party and the hard work of the masses themselves, a large number of cadres and technical personnel have been cultivated. Among them are management area secretaries and directors, as well as production team leaders, bookkeepers, administrators, and teachers in people's schools. There are also farmer technicians and technicians who can master new agricultural tools and advanced farming techniques. What a remarkable and enormous change this is!
    With their tenacious fighting spirit of "standing up to fight against nature and sitting down to advance towards culture," what difficulties can stop them, and what cultural mountains cannot be conquered! Their spirit of seizing every minute and second, "studying wherever production goes, studying wherever work goes," finally keeps the school open year-round, breaking the routine of production being busy and learning stopping. They rely on their own efforts and run schools thriftily, never just looking up to the sky and reaching out to superiors. If there are no materials, everyone contributes; if there is no firewood, they go up the mountain to collect it. They built two spacious people's schools on flat ground and solved the difficulties of school desks, chairs, benches, lamp oil, paper, and pens, and even established their own library.
    Lenin said: "A communist society cannot be built in a country filled with illiteracy." This is an important issue. In our people's commune, this superior social organization, we are fully capable of solving this problem. The blooming of cultural flowers all over Hongduogou is a powerful proof of this. From the changes in Hongduogou, a vision of a socialist countryside with a high level of science and culture has already been unfolded before us.

    从红朵沟看全国
    顾明
    读了“文化之花开遍红朵沟”这篇“党委书记手记”，令人感动兴奋不已。你看，在一个历来是文盲村，“仅有几个识字人，亲朋故友来封信，数里之外去求人”的地方，经过党的领导和群众自己的艰苦奋斗，已经培养出大批有文化的干部和技术人材。这里面有管理区书记、主任，也有生产队长、记账员、管理员、民校教师，还有能够掌握新式农具、先进耕作技术的农民技术手和技术员。这是一个多么了不起的巨大变化。
    在他们那种“站起来向自然搏斗，坐下来向文化进军”的顽强斗志之下，还有什么困难可以阻挡他们，还有什么文化高山不能攻克！他们“生产到那里学习到那里，工作到那里学习到那里”的争分夺秒的精神，终于使学校常年不散，打破了生产忙、学习停的常规。他们自力更生勤俭办学，绝不两眼望青天，向上级伸手。没有材料就大家凑，没有烧柴就上山打，平地盖起了两所宽敞的民校，并且解决了学校桌、椅、板凳、灯油、纸笔的困难，还建立了自己的图书馆。
    列宁说过：“在一个文盲充斥的国家里，是建成不了共产主义社会的。”这是一个重要的问题。在我们人民公社这个优越的社会组织里，这个问题完全有力量加以解决。在红朵沟里遍开文化之花，这就是一个有力的证明。从红朵沟的变化，一幅有高度科学文化的社会主义农村的远景已经展现在我们面前了。
