Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st. TASS reported: The latest issue of "New Times" published a lengthy article commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, stating that the Bandung Conference played a significant role in strengthening the national awakening of the people of Asia and Africa and their will to fight for independence. The ideas of the Bandung Conference inspired this struggle. Since the Bandung Conference, the process of shaking off colonialism has developed rapidly, sometimes almost unimaginably.

The article said that before the Second World War, the population of protectorates and colonies was 690 million. 38% of the world's population once wore colonial shackles. Now, most countries have gained independence. The areas where colonialists can do whatever they want are shrinking rapidly.

The article pointed out that in these five years, imperialism has not laid down its weapons for a moment. From time to time, they have continuously plotted conspiracies here and there, attacking national liberation movements. Armed intervention in Egypt, sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan, plotting armed rebellions in Indonesia, creating political turmoil in Laos and Cambodia, and constantly attempting to interfere in the internal and foreign affairs of young independent countries.

The article concluded by saying that in these years, rivers of blood have flowed in Africa. Bloody suppression, arrests, and crusades are being carried out in Kenya, Nyasaland, Cameroon, Northern Rhodesia, and now in South Africa. The struggle continues in all aspects. And the ending has been predetermined. People may be able to delay and make the process of eradicating colonialism difficult, but they cannot stop it.

    苏联“新时代”杂志发表文章纪念万隆会议五周年
    亚非反殖民主义斗争迅速发展
    帝国主义没有放下武器仍在不断策划阴谋
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期“新时代”发表的纪念万隆会议五周年的长篇文章说，万隆会议在加强亚非人民的民族觉醒和他们为独立而斗争的意志方面起了很大作用。万隆会议的思想鼓舞着这个斗争。万隆会议以后，摆脱殖民主义的过程迅速发展，有时简直是令人不可想像的。
    文章说，被保护国和殖民地的人口在第二次世界大战以前为六亿九千万人。世界上38％的居民曾经戴着殖民枷锁。而现在，大部分国家已经取得独立。殖民主义者可以为所欲为的地区日益迅速缩小。
    文章指出，这五年来，帝国主义一刻也没有放下武器，他们时而在这里，时而在那里，不断策划阴谋，打击民族解放运动。武装干涉埃及，出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，在印度尼西亚策划武装叛乱，在老挝和柬埔寨制造政治骚乱，不断企图干涉年轻的独立国家的内政和外交。
    文章最后说，这些年来，在非洲流血成河。在怯尼亚、尼亚萨兰、喀麦隆、北罗得西亚，现在又在南非进行血腥镇压、逮捕、讨伐。斗争在各方面继续进行着。而结局是预先就决定了的。人们也许可以使铲除殖民主义的过程延缓和困难起来，然而却无法阻止它。
