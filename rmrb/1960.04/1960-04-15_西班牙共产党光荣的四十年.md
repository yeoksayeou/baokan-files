    The Glorious Forty Years of the Communist Party of Spain	Luis Lacasa, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain
    The Communist Party of Spain has been through forty years from its foundation until now. Over the past forty years, the Communist Party of Spain has gone through a difficult and glorious road.
    (I)
    After the International Workingmen's Association (the First International) was founded by Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific Marxism, in 1864, Marxist ideas began to spread in Spain. Just as the struggle between Marxism and anarchism was unfolding internationally at that time, the struggle between the two ideologies was also taking place fiercely in the Spanish domestic worker movement. Under the influence of the above two trends, Spain established the Socialist Party and trade union organizations, forming two major trade union centers: one was the Spanish General Workers' Union with socialist tendencies; the other was the National Labor Confederation with anarchist tendencies. However, both the Socialist Party (which, like other socialist parties in Europe, soon fell into the quagmire of reformism) and the anarchist faction became the main obstacles to instilling Marxist ideas in the Spanish working masses and promoting revolutionary progress.
    At that time, the revolutionary struggle of the Spanish working people was surging. The strikes and protest movements organized by the militant Spanish workers oppressed by the ruling class—landlords, bourgeoisie—were springing up everywhere.
    However, the leaders of the reformist and bureaucratic Socialist Party were afraid of the masses; and the anarcho-syndicalists launched reckless and adventurous actions, which greatly hindered and struck the struggle of the working class. Therefore, there was an urgent need for a genuine proletarian party armed with solid Marxist theory that could lead the masses to victory. During the First World War, the most combative and far-sighted Spanish Socialist Youth League had already stood with Lenin's internationalist position maintained at the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences. Soon after, the National Congress of the Spanish Socialist Youth League decided on April 15, 1920 (this is a historically significant day for the Spanish communist movement) to rename the League as the Communist Party of Spain. In the same year, a group of veteran members of the Socialist Party abandoned the reformist line that dominated the party and organized the Communist Workers' Party, which soon merged with the Communist Party of Spain.
    (II)
    From the first day of its establishment, the Communist Party of Spain has been persistently fighting for the unity of workers, for the establishment of a united front to win the rights of workers and to implement the party's minimum common program including all workers' organizations.
    At that time, the Spanish monarchy was already very fragile; internal contradictions and the outdated socio-economic structure built on the brutal exploitation of workers led to the gradual disintegration of the monarchy. At this time, General Primo de Rivera, with the king's consent, declared a military dictatorship.
    The activities of different parties and trade union organizations were tested by their firmness and strength in the face of Rivera's dictatorship. The Socialists shamelessly cooperated with the dictator. Under the circumstances at that time, the vast National Labor Confederation, under the influence of anarchists, agreed to dissolve its leading bodies, close local organizations, and at the same time stop publishing publications. Only the Communist Party continued to fight, and thus the Communist Party of Spain became the target of the government's brutal suppression, with five central committees destroyed and most central committee members imprisoned.
    The Rivera's dictatorship, which was corrupt and maintained only by terrorist rule, was incapable of solving the fundamental problems of Spain. The feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie could not but replace new ruling figures. But all this could not save the collapse of the feudal monarchy. The subsequent Aznar government was forced to announce elections. The result of the election was a great victory for those who favored the republic. The king was forced to abdicate and left Spain.
    During the Republic period, our country and party developed to a new stage. The autocratic rule ended, and the party gained legal status. However, the bourgeois republican government still excluded the Communist Party from participating. The masses who enthusiastically supported republicanism and socialist leaders soon found that their hopes had been dashed. The republican government did not carry out even the most basic reforms: it did not carry out a thorough land reform, nor did it solve the national question, the colonial question, and the prosperity of the national economy. In 1932, the Communist Party of Spain held its Fourth Congress in Seville; it established the leadership of José Díaz and Dolores Ibárruri, who played a very important role in correcting the narrow and dogmatic policies that harmed the party and laying the foundation for the party's Marxism-Leninism. The number of party members also increased from 30,000 to 100,000 in 1936. At this time, the Communist Party of Spain participated in the government and used all its strength to influence the Republican government to make it as in line with the interests and wishes of the people as possible.
    However, the reactionaries would not allow Spain to embark on the path of bourgeois democratic revolution for a moment. Because of a series of constant activities of the Communist Party, especially the Communist Party of Spain's participation in the government and the establishment of a People's Front including Republicans and workers, the reactionary forces regarded the Communist Party as a thorn in their side. The reactionary forces colluded with foreign forces to prepare for a fascist rebellion, and these foreign forces also wanted to find a reliable rear in the Pyrenees to launch the Second World War.
    (III)
    On July 18, 1936, the fascist rebellion launched by Franco caused a long civil war in Spain. During the nearly three years of the civil war, the Spanish people heroically resisted the domestic reactionaries, Nazis, and Italian fascists, and opposed the so-called "non-interference" policy of the Western reactionary bourgeois governments. At that time, the Soviet Union and international progressive forces stood on the side of the Spanish people, supporting the just struggle of the Spanish people with all their strength.
    Throughout the civil war, the Communist Party of Spain played a prominent role in the struggle against the fascist rebellion, and it dedicated its best sons and daughters, with tens of thousands of party members sacrificing on the front lines. The main reason why our party could play its significant role in the war against fascism for national independence was due to the party's political unity and internal strong solidarity. Throughout the war, the party maintained an unshakable belief that the people would eventually achieve the final victory, without any hesitation or retreat.
    In 1939, due to the surrender of socialists, anarchists, and others within the People's Front, Spain finally fell into the hands of Franco and his henchmen. The failure of the Republic caused countless patriotic people to be shot, tens of thousands of people to be arrested as political prisoners, and hundreds of thousands of people to flee abroad. Franco's fascist rule plunged the Spanish people into an abyss of terror, hunger, and suffering. But the heroic Communist Party of Spain was not intimidated by all this bloody suppression. It maintained its belief in the ultimate victory of the people's cause and led the people to persevere in the struggle. From 1939 to 1949, guerrilla activities developed throughout the country.
    (IV)
    The twenty years of Franco's rule were the "twenty years of waste and decline" for Spain. Over the past twenty years, Spain's economy has stagnated. The Spanish people live in extreme poverty. After the Second World War, Franco further sold Spain to American imperialism. The United States established military bases in Spain, and American monopoly capital controlled the Spanish economy, sucking the blood of the Spanish people. The world's reactionary forces colluded with Franco, vainly trying to turn Spain into a piece of meat on their chopping block forever.
    But the Spanish people have never succumbed in their entire history. They cannot long endure the current situation. Since Franco's rule, the Spanish people's struggle against Franco's traitorous regime has never stopped. Tens of thousands of working people, despite the rule of terror, have actively participated in various large-scale mass struggles. Under the inspiration and leadership of the Communist Party, these mass movements are shaking the foundations of the evil Franco regime. Particularly important among them was the "National Reconciliation Day" on May 5, 1958. On that day, people in all major cities across the country held large-scale mass demonstrations against the current regime in a peaceful way. Since then, the nationwide general strike on June 18, 1959 also severely hit the Franco regime. In this struggle, hundreds of thousands of peasants were also mobilized to participate. This was a great progress in raising the awareness of the Spanish people. This nationwide peaceful general strike has become a united action under the call of the Communist Party, including various domestic forces, workers, the national bourgeoisie, and Catholics. This further demonstrated the victory of the Communist Party of Spain's policy of solidarity and struggle. On the basis of victorious struggles, the Communist Party of Spain recently once again proposed to convene a "round table" conference between various anti-Franco forces. Our policy of unity aimed at achieving "national reconciliation" is based on the objective fact that more and more classes, including workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, have understood that the only way to save Spain from destruction is for all forces opposed to Franco's rule to unite. Faced with the growing public discontent of the masses, the Franco government has launched another wave of repression, arresting and killing people indiscriminately. The targets of the repression include Spanish youths who returned from the Soviet Union through legal procedures, outstanding trade union activists, and progressive intellectuals, because they have more and more powerfully and clearly condemned the Franco regime's policies of creating terror, destruction, and hunger.
    The Communist Party of Spain persists in its struggle with a consistent spirit of courage and unyielding, exposing the atrocities of Franco's rule. The Communist Party is not afraid of slander and oppression, because it knows that the path it is taking is the correct path. Although a handful of oligarchs and reactionaries, supported by foreign imperialism, are trying to stop the wheels of history from moving forward, the Communist Party of Spain firmly believes that the day when the whole nation will be free from their shackles is not far away. The Communist Party of Spain will fight to the end to achieve this goal.

    西班牙共产党光荣的四十年	西班牙共产党中央委员　路易斯·拉卡沙
    西班牙共产党从创立到现在已经四十年了。四十年来西班牙共产党走过了艰巨而光荣的道路。		（一）
    1864年由科学马克思主义的奠基人马克思和恩格斯创立了国际劳动者协会（即第一国际）之后，马克思主义的思想开始在西班牙传播开来。就像当时国际上展开马克思主义与无政府主义的斗争一样，在西班牙国内的工人运动中两种思想的斗争也在激烈进行着。西班牙就在上述两种潮流的影响下成立了社会党和工会组织，形成了两大工会中心：一个是社会主义倾向的西班牙工人联合总会；另一个是无政府主义倾向的全国劳工联合会。但是不管是社会党（它像欧洲的其他社会党一样不久即陷到改良主义的泥坑中），或者是无政府主义派都成了在西班牙工人群众中灌输马克思主义思想和推进革命前进的主要障碍。
    当时正值西班牙劳动人民的革命斗争高涨的时期。受统治阶级——地主、资产阶级——所压迫的富有战斗性的西班牙劳动者所组织的罢工和抗议运动风起云涌。
    但是，改良主义和官僚化的社会党的领导人害怕群众；而无政府工团主义者则胡乱发动冒险行动，使工人阶级的斗争受到很大障碍和打击。因此迫切需要有一个用巩固的马克思主义理论武装起来的、能够领导群众走向胜利的真正的无产阶级政党。在第一次世界大战期间，最具有斗争性和远见的西班牙社会主义青年联盟，当时就已经同列宁在西门尔瓦尔特和金萨尔会议上所维护的国际主义立场站在一起。不久以后，西班牙社会主义青年联盟全国代表大会在1920年4月15日（这是西班牙共产主义运动具有历史意义的日子）决定把该联盟改为西班牙共产党。同年，社会党的一部分久经锻炼的党员放弃了统治该党的改良主义路线，并且组织了共产主义工人党，不久它同西班牙共产党合并到一起。		（二）
    西班牙共产党从成立的第一天起就坚持不懈地为工人的团结，为成立一个争取工人的权利和包括一切工人组织能实行党的最低的共同纲领的统一战线而斗争。
    当时西班牙的君主政体已经是十分脆弱的了；内部的矛盾和建筑在残暴地剥削劳动者基础上过了时的社会经济结构使得君主政体逐渐瓦解。就在这个时候，贝里莫·得·里维拉将军在国王的同意下宣布了军事独裁。
    不同的党派和工会组织的活动在里维拉的独裁前面考验了它们斗争的坚定性和它们的力量。社会党人肆无忌惮地同独裁者合作。在当时的形势下，庞大的全国劳工联合会在无政府主义者的影响下，同意解散了它的领导机构，封闭了地方组织，并同时停止出版刊物。只有共产党继续坚持斗争，因而西班牙共产党也就成为政府残酷镇压的对象，先后有五个中央委员会被破坏，大部分中央委员被监禁。
    腐朽的，只是靠恐怖统治来维持的里维拉独裁政府是无力解决西班牙的根本问题的。封建地主和资产阶级不能不更换新的统治人物。但是这一切都不能挽救封建君主政体的瓦解。在后来成立的阿士那尔政府，被迫宣布举行选举。选举的结果是赞成共和国的人获得巨大的胜利。国王被迫退位，离开了西班牙。
    在共和国时期，我们的国家和党发展到了一个新的阶段。专制统治结束了，党取得了合法的地位。但是资产阶级的共和国政府仍然排斥共产党参加。而热情拥护共和主义和社会党领袖的群众很快发现了他们的希望落空了，共和国的政府并没有作一些起码的改革：既没有进行一次深刻的土地改革，也没有解决民族问题、殖民地问题和国民经济繁荣的问题。1932年西班牙共产党在塞维亚召开第四次代表大会；确立了何塞·第亚士和多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽的领导，他们在纠正危害党的狭隘的教条的方针和给党奠定马克思列宁主义的基础方面起了十分重要的作用。党员人数在1936年也由三万人增加到十万人。这时西班牙共产党参加了政府并用一切力量来影响共和政府，使它尽量符合人民的利益和愿望。
    但是反动派是一刻也不会让西班牙走上资产阶级民主革命的道路的。由于共产党一系列的经常不断的活动，特别是西班牙共产党参加了政府，建立了包括共和主义者和工人参加的人民阵线，使得反动势力把共产党看作眼中钉。反动势力勾结外国势力准备进行法西斯的叛乱，而这些外国势力也正想为发动第二次世界大战在比利牛斯山找到一个可靠的后方。		（三）
    1936年7月18日，佛朗哥发动的法西斯叛乱，造成了西班牙长期的内战。在将近三年的内战中，西班牙人民英勇地抗击国内反动派、纳粹分子和意大利法西斯分子，反对西方反动资产阶级政府的所谓“不干涉”政策。当时苏联和国际进步力量都纷起站在西班牙人民这一边，用一切力量支援西班牙人民的正义斗争。
    在整个内战时期，西班牙共产党在反对法西斯叛乱的斗争中起了突出的作用，它献出了自己最优秀的儿女，成千上万的党员牺牲在火线上。在反对法西斯争取民族独立的战争中，我们党之所以能发挥它的重大作用，主要由于党在政治上的一致和内部的坚强团结。在整个战争过程中，党都保持着人民必将获得最后胜利的不可动摇的信念，没有丝毫犹豫或退缩。
    1939年由于人民阵线内部社会党人、无政府主义者等的投降行为，终于使西班牙落到了佛朗哥及其党羽手中。共和国的失败使无数爱国志士遭受枪杀，数万人作为政治犯被逮捕，数十万人流亡国外。佛朗哥的法西斯统治使西班牙人民陷入了恐怖、饥饿和苦难的深渊中。但是英勇的西班牙共产党并没有被这一切血腥的镇压所吓倒，它保持着对人民事业必将获胜的信念，领导着人民坚持斗争。从1939年至1949年，游击活动发展到全国各地。		（四）
    佛朗哥统治的二十年，是西班牙“荒废和衰败的二十年”。二十年来西班牙的经济是停滞不前的。西班牙人民生活在极端贫困的处境中。第二次世界大战后，佛朗哥更把西班牙出卖给美国帝国主义。美国在西班牙建立军事基地，美国垄断资本掌握西班牙的经济，吮吸着西班牙人民的膏血。世界反动势力和佛朗哥勾结在一起，妄想把西班牙永远变成它们为所欲为的俎上肉。
    但是西班牙人民，在他们的全部历史中，从来是不会屈服的。他们决不能够长期忍受当前的遭遇。从佛朗哥统治以来，西班牙人民反对佛朗哥卖国政权的斗争丝毫没有停止过。成千上万的劳动人民，不顾恐怖统治，纷纷参加各种大规模的群众性斗争。在共产党的鼓舞和领导下，这些群众运动正在震撼着万恶的佛朗哥政权的基础。其中特别重要的有1958年5月5日的“全国和解日”。那一天，全国各主要城市的西班牙人都通过和平方式举行了反对现政权的大规模群众示威游行。此后1959年6月18日的全国大罢工也严厉地打击了佛朗哥政权。在这次斗争中，还发动了数十万农民参加。这在提高西班牙人民群众的觉悟方面是一个巨大的进步。这次全国和平大罢工成为一个在共产党号召下，包括各种不同的国内力量，工人、民族资产阶级、天主教徒等人参加的联合行动，这更显示了西班牙共产党团结斗争政策的胜利。在胜利斗争的基础上，西班牙共产党最近再一次提出，建议召开各反佛朗哥力量之间的“圆桌”会议。我们的以实现“全国和解”为目的的团结政策是建立在这样的客观事实的基础上的：愈来愈多的阶层，包括工人、农民、小资产阶级以及民族资产阶级已经懂得，挽救西班牙免于毁灭的唯一出路就是一切反对佛朗哥统治的力量团结起来。面对着群众日益增长的公开不满，佛朗哥政府又掀起了镇压高潮，乱抓乱杀。镇压对象包括通过合法手续从苏联回国的西班牙青年、杰出的工会活动家和进步知识分子，因为他们愈来愈有力和明显地谴责佛朗哥政权制造恐怖、毁灭和饥饿的政策。
    西班牙共产党以一贯的奋勇不屈的精神坚持斗争，揭露佛朗哥统治的暴行。共产党不怕诽谤，不怕压迫，因为它知道自己走的道路是正确的道路。虽然一小撮寡头统治者和反动派在外国帝国主义的扶持下，妄图阻止历史前进的车轮，但是西班牙共产党坚信，全国人民摆脱他们的枷锁的日子已经为期不远了。西班牙共产党将为了实现这个目的奋斗到底。
