Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th — Seoul dispatch: An uprising of more than 20,000 people against the fascist rule of the Lee Syngman clique erupted in Masan City, South Korea, on the night of the 11th. This morning, the rebellious people are still fighting the police. According to South Korea's Dongyang News Agency, angry crowds shouted slogans such as "Lee Syngman regime step down," "Oppose fraudulent elections," and "Arrest the murderous police officers," demonstrating everywhere in Masan City. The people of Masan City, enraged by the Lee Syngman clique's bloody massacre of the people on March 15, surrounded the Masan City Police Station and the Namseong-dong Police Substation, as well as the Masan City Party Headquarters of Lee Syngman's Liberal Party, and surrounded the residences of the Mayor of Masan City, the Police Chief, and Liberal Party members of parliament, destroying the buildings with stones. The rebellious masses also burned the jeep of the police chief of the Lee Syngman clique. According to the South Korean News Agency, the uprising unfolded as follows: On April 11, the body of a young man named Kim Joo-yeol was found near the coast of Masan; he had been beaten to death by the police during the Masan City people's demonstration on March 15 against the Lee Syngman clique's fake presidential "election." When the people of Masan City heard the news, more than 1,000 students and citizens rushed to the hospital where Kim Joo-yeol's body was placed at 6:30 p.m. that day, demanding that the police authorities and judges hand over Kim Joo-yeol's body to them. When their request was refused, they chanted slogans and launched a demonstration. The deceased's sister walked at the front of the procession, shouting, "Avenge my brother!"
	Subsequently, the citizens of Masan, who vividly remembered the bloody massacre carried out by the Lee Syngman clique here more than twenty days ago, immediately surged from all directions. Students, women, citizens, and even teenagers joined the ranks of the uprising. By about 8:00 p.m., the number of rebellious people had surged to more than 10,000 and was still increasing. The panicked Lee Syngman clique dispatched a large number of police to suppress the uprising everywhere, and opened fire on the masses, killing a 19-year-old middle school student named Kim Wan-gu on the spot, and wounding six or seven others. The angry masses disregarded the police's suppression and fought bravely with the brutal police of the Lee Syngman clique. They bravely used stones and seized carbines and grenades to fight the police of the Lee Syngman clique.
	In order to suppress this uprising, the Lee Syngman clique ordered the 36,000 police in South Korea to impose emergency martial law throughout South Korea from 10:50 p.m. on the 11th. The Lee Syngman clique's Army Headquarters also ordered all soldiers to be fully armed this morning in preparation for suppressing the uprising of the people of Masan City, and the Army Special Forces also entered a state of emergency readiness from midnight this morning.
	However, the South Korean people were not intimidated by Lee Syngman's force. The Masan City people's uprising struggle continues to unfold fiercely today. According to the South Korean World News Agency, another 10,000 people demonstrated in the streets at noon today and fought the police.
	At about 10:00 a.m. today, hundreds of students from Masan High School, Masan Industrial High School, and other schools gathered after arriving at school, held up banners, and rushed out of the school gates to demonstrate in the streets. Subsequently, the ranks of workers and citizens on the streets joined together. The rebellious masses gathered more and more. They shouted "Save democracy!" and condemned Lee Syngman's fraudulent election. The rebellious masses shouted "Mayor get out!" in front of the Lee Syngman clique's Masan "City Government"! The rebellious masses broke through the two or three layers of cordon set up by a large number of Lee Syngman clique police throughout Masan City and advanced towards New Masan. They were applauded and supported by passers-by on the streets along the way.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th — More than 15,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a mass rally at the Moranbong Open-Air Theater at 6:00 p.m. today to support the uprising of the people of Masan City, South Korea, against the fascist rule of Lee Syngman.
	Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Jeong Il-ryong, Nam Il, and Lee Joo-yeon, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Geum-cheol and Kim Chang-man, and other leaders of the Party and government, as well as heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, attended the meeting.
	The masses attending the rally constantly raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "Support the Masan people's uprising," "Abolish the Lee Syngman fascist rule," and "U.S. troops get out of South Korea immediately."
	Bai Nan-un, President of the Korean Academy of Sciences, spoke at the meeting, warmly praising the uprising action of more than 20,000 people in Masan City, which began on the evening of the 11th, against the fascist rule of Lee Syngman. He pointed out that the people of Masan are now bravely fighting with stones and seized carbines and grenades against the police of the Lee Syngman clique who are suppressing them, which shows that the South Korean people, who have suffered under the oppression of the U.S.-Lee clique for fifteen years, can no longer endure it. The entire people of Pyongyang warmly support the patriotic struggle of the people of Masan City and give it full support.
	Bai Nan-un said that the Lee Syngman clique dispatched more than 500 police officers to suppress the people of Masan, killing and wounding many people. We firmly condemn and oppose this atrocity of the Lee Syngman clique.
	He said that due to the dark rule of the U.S.-Lee clique, South Korea has become a living hell. The Lee Syngman clique's fraudulent fake presidential "election" on March 15 further nakedly exposed its fascist face. They have been completely isolated among the South Korean people. Today, the South Korean people's struggle against the U.S.-Lee clique has been burning like a prairie fire, erupting like a volcano, which no force can suppress.
	Bai Nan-un called on all the people of South Korea to mobilize and respond to the uprising of the people of Masan, and to support the struggle of the people of Masan. He pointed out that as long as the whole nation unites, it can dispel the dark clouds over the Korean nation.
	He called on the South Korean "National Defense Army" and the police not to point their guns at their own elders and brothers, and called on the South Korean cultural figures to take up their pens and point them at the fascist rule of the Lee Syngman clique to support the people's struggle.
	Subsequently, workers' representative Yoon Byeong-geun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League Oh Hyun-joo, and famous Korean singer Kim Young-gil, who recently returned from Japan, also spoke at the meeting. They all warmly praised and supported the heroic struggle of the people of Masan.
	The meeting passed letters to the people of Masan and to the people of South Korea.

    南朝鲜人民要李承晚政权滚下台来
    马山市两万人起义反对法西斯统治
    白南云在平壤群众大会上号召南朝鲜全体人民一致支持马山人民的斗争
    新华社平壤12日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜马山市在11日夜间爆发了两万多人反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的起义。今天上午，起义人民还在同警察展开斗争。据南朝鲜东洋通讯社报道，愤怒的群众高呼着“李承晚政权滚下台来”、“反对骗人的选举”、“把杀人的警官抓起来”等口号，在马山市内到处示威。这些为李承晚集团3月15日血腥屠杀人民的暴行所激怒的马山市人民，像滚滚的海潮，包围了马山市警察署和南城洞警察派出所以及李承晚的自由党的马山市党部，并且包围了马山市长、警察署长以及自由党议员们的住宅，用石头把这些地方的建筑物捣毁了。起义群众还烧毁了李承晚集团警察署署长的吉普车。据南朝鲜通讯社报道，爆发这次起义的经过是：4月11日，在马山附近海边发现了一个名叫金周烈的青年的尸体，他是在3月15日马山市人民示威反对李承晚集团的伪总统“选举”时被警察打死的。当马山市人民听说这一消息后，当天下午六时半就有一千多名学生和市民跑到停放金周烈尸体的病院，要求警察当局和法官把金周烈的尸体交给他们。当他们的要求遭到拒绝的时候，他们就高呼口号展开了示威。死者的妹妹走在队伍前面，高呼，“为我的哥哥报仇！”
    接着，对二十多天前李承晚集团在这里进行的血腥屠杀记忆犹新的马山市民们立刻从四面八方涌去，学生、妇女、市民，甚至连十来岁的少年儿童也纷纷参加了起义的队伍。到晚上八点左右，起义群众就激增到一万多人，并且越来越多。惊慌失措的李承晚集团出动了大批警察到处镇压，并向群众开枪射击，当场就打死了一个十九岁的名叫金完九的中学生，另外还打伤了六、七人。愤怒的群众不顾警察的镇压，同残暴的李承晚集团警察展开搏斗。他们英勇地用石头和争夺来的卡宾枪和手榴弹同李承晚集团的警察进行战斗。
    李承晚集团为了镇压这次起义，下令南朝鲜三万六千名警察从11日晚十时五十分起在整个南朝鲜实行紧急戒严。李承晚集团陆军总部在今天早晨也下令全体士兵全副武装，准备镇压马山市的起义人民，陆军特务部队也从今晨零时开始进入紧急戒备状态。
    但是，南朝鲜人民并没有被李承晚的武力吓倒。马山市人民的起义斗争今天继续炽烈地展开。据南朝鲜世界通讯社报道，今天中午又有一万名群众在街上示威，并同警察展开斗争。
    今天上午十时左右，马山高等学校、马山工业高等学校等学校的数百名学生，到校后就集合起来，举着标语，冲出校门上街示威。接着，工人的队伍，街上的市民都汇合在一起。起义群众越聚越多。他们高呼“拯救民主政治！”，并且谴责李承晚的骗人选举。起义群众在李承晚集团马山“市政府”前面高呼“市长滚蛋”！起义群众冲破了大批李承晚集团警察在马山全市布下的两重或三重的警戒网，向新马山方向前进。他们沿途受到街上行人的鼓掌欢迎和支持。
    新华社平壤12日电　平壤市各界一万五千多人今天下午六时在牡丹峰露天剧场举行群众大会，支持南朝鲜马山市人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的起义。
    参加大会的有朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一、内阁副首相郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金哲、金昌满等党和政府的领导人和各民主党派、社会团体的负责人。
    参加集会的群众不断振臂高呼：“支持马山人民的起义”、“废除李承晚法西斯统治”、“美军立即从南朝鲜滚出去”等口号。
    朝鲜科学院院长白南云在会上讲话中，热烈赞扬马山市两万多人11日晚开始举行的反对李承晚法西斯统治的起义行动。他指出，马山人民现在正用石头和夺来的卡宾枪和手榴弹同镇压他们的李承晚集团警察英勇战斗，这说明十五年来受尽了美李集团的压迫的南朝鲜人民再也不能忍受了。平壤市全体人民热烈支持马山市人民的爱国斗争，并给予全力的支援。
    白南云说，李承晚集团出动了五百多名警察镇压马山人民，打死打伤了许多群众。我们坚决谴责和反对李承晚集团的这一暴行。
    他说，由于美李集团的黑暗统治，南朝鲜已变成人间地狱。李承晚集团在3月15日进行的骗人的伪总统“选举”更加赤裸裸地暴露了它的法西斯面目。它们在南朝鲜人民中已经完全孤立。今天，南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的斗争已经像燎原烈火一样燃烧起来，像火山一样爆发了，这是任何力量也压制不了的。
    白南云号召南朝鲜全体人民一致动员起来，响应马山人民的起义，支援马山人民的斗争。他指出：只要全民族团结起来就能驱散压在朝鲜民族头上的乌云。
    他号召南朝鲜的“国防军”和警察不要把枪口对着自己的父老兄弟，并且号召南朝鲜文化界人士拿起笔杆指向李承晚集团的法西斯统治，支援人民的斗争。
    接着，工人代表尹炳根、朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长吴铉周、最近由日本回国的旅日朝侨著名歌唱家金永吉等都在大会上讲了话。他们一致热烈赞扬和支持马山人民的英勇斗争。
    大会通过了给马山人民和给南朝鲜人民的信。
