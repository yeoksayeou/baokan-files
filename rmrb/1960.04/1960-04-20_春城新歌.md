Spring City New Songs

	New Scene	Su Zongren, Wang Huiqiu
	Hot food and dishes in the canteen,
	Wiping tables and carrying benches;
	Sister-in-law smiles brightly,
	Moving back and forth between seats...
	Someone at the table asks:
	"Why are you so energetic?"
	"Managing such a big family,
	How can I not be happy!"

	Sewing Group
	Hanging lanterns and decorations,
	Full of joy;
	Beating gongs and drums,
	Firecrackers ringing one after another...
	"Mom, it's so lively,
	Who's getting married?"
	"Child, don't shout!
	"Look! A sewing machine is entering the new home..."

	Barbershop
	Little Ming from the Zhang family,
	Little Hua from the Wang family,
	Each vying to sit in front of the mirror,
	Wanting the older sister to cut their hair.
	White hats, white smocks,
	The older sister smiles like a flower;
	Skillful hands use scissors—
	Everyone glows with health...

	Nursery
	Old Li returns from work,
	Inside the door, all is quiet;
	"Where did Sulan go—"
	Rows of cradles in the room,
	She sits by the bed, rocking her hand:
	"Shhh! Be quiet!
	The children just fell asleep..."

	Two Visits
      Wang Gongfan
	Two months ago, I passed through Beijing,
	And visited my aunt along the way.
	She was spinning around the stove,
	The child on the bed was kicking and crying.
	My aunt busily dressed the child,
	And washed the soiled diaper,
	The rice pot on the stove emitted a burnt smell,
	Anxiously, she was sweating and complaining.

	Yesterday, I passed through Beijing again,
	And went to see my aunt again,
	I saw the door of her house ajar,
	The house was clean, but no one was in sight.
	I was secretly wondering,
	When Grandma next door chimed in:
	"Your aunt is working at a community-run shoe factory,
	I just finished tidying up her house."

	Before the old grandma finished speaking,
	Laughter rang out in the corridor,
	A group of women returned from work,
	My aunt hurried through the doorway.

	My aunt's face was radiant,
	Talking and laughing while gesturing with her hands,
	Looking at her happy energy,
	She seemed like a young girl full of youth.

	Before I could interject,
	She tightly took my hand:
	"Come! Let's go to our community canteen,
	I'll treat you to a meal of dumplings!"

	I followed my aunt through the street center,
	The faces of the passersby were kind,
	Each poplar tree sprouted new green buds,
	My heart surged like the spring tide...

    春城新歌
        新景	苏宗仁　王慧秋
    食堂里饭菜热腾腾，
    抹桌又端凳；
    大嫂笑颜开，
    席间穿梭行……
    桌旁有人问：
    “为啥这样起劲？”
    “当这么大的家，
    我怎能不高兴！”	缝纫组
    挂灯结彩，
    喜气洋洋；
    敲锣又打鼓，
    鞭炮连声响……
    “妈妈，这么热闹，
    谁家娶新娘？”
    “孩子，别嚷！
    “你看！缝纫机进新房”……
        理发室
    张家小明，
    王家小华，
    个个争坐镜台前，
    要大姐理发。
    白帽白罩衣，
    大姐笑得像朵花；
    巧手使夹剪——
    人人容光焕发……
        托儿所
    老李下班回，
    门内静悄悄；
    “素兰呢？哪里去了——”
    房里摇篮排成行，
    她坐床边把手摇：
    “嘘！别吵！
    孩子们才睡着……”
        两次作客
      王功藩
    二月前我路过北京，
    顺便拜望了大婶。
    她围着锅台打转，
    床上的孩子弹腿啼喊。
    大婶忙给孩子穿衣，
    又把换下的尿布洗净，
    火炉上饭锅冒出焦味，
    急得她热汗浇头怨声阵阵。
    昨天我又从北京路过，
    顺便又去看望大婶，
    只见她家的房门虚掩，
    满屋清洁却不见人影。
    我正在暗地纳闷，
    东邻奶奶过来搭岔：
    “你大婶在民办鞋厂工作，
    我也刚把她屋里拾掇干净”。
    老奶奶的话尚未落音，
    走廊里响起格格笑声，
    一群妇女下班归来，
    大婶急步踏入门坎。
    大婶的脸上红光闪闪，
    又说又笑还双手指划，
    看她那股高兴劲儿，
    仿佛一位少女青春。
    不等我插话开腔，
    她紧把我的手搀起：
    “走！到咱居民食堂，
    请你吃一顿饺子！”
    我尾随大婶穿过街心，
    道旁的行人面容可亲，
    棵棵白杨吐出碧绿新芽，
    我的心呀像春潮翻滚……
