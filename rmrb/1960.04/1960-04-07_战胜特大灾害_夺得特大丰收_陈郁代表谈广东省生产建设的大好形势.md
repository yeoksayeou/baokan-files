I fully endorse the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Premier Tan, and I guarantee to conscientiously implement the spirit of the reports.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Guangdong Province has achieved tremendous development in industrial and agricultural production and the entire national economy in recent years. Since the Great Leap Forward, people's mental outlook has changed even more, productive forces have developed faster, and the speed of socialist construction has accelerated unprecedentedly. As everyone knows, Guangdong was a province with a relatively serious degree of colonialization in its economy before liberation, with insufficient grain and reliance on imported foreign rice. After liberation, due to the implementation of the Central Committee's policy of focusing on agriculture, and through continuous efforts, the province achieved grain self-sufficiency by 1953, and has since annually transferred some grain to support national economic construction. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the total grain output of the province reached 32 billion catties, doubling that of 1949. In 1959, despite being hit by extraordinary floods, the grain output not only maintained the level of 1958, but the agricultural output value also increased by 12% compared with 1958. In the past two years, Guangdong's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all greatly exceeded the highest levels before liberation. Economic crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, flue-cured tobacco, and jute have increased by one to ten times compared with the year of liberation. The face of agricultural production has undergone fundamental changes. The extraordinary flood of 1959 was another severe test for the people of Guangdong. At that time, in counties such as Heyuan, Huiyang, and Zengcheng, the rainfall reached one thousand several hundred millimeters within a month, and the maximum flood peak levels of the Dongjiang, Beijiang, and Xijiang rivers all exceeded the highest records in decades. A total of 5.8 million mu of rice paddies were flooded in the province, resulting in the loss of several billion catties of grain and the collapse of more than 200,000 houses. Before liberation, if such a serious natural disaster had occurred, countless people would have been in a state of hunger and cold, displaced, and struggling on the brink of death. But this time, under the strong leadership of the Party, with the care and support of the Central Committee and all fraternal provinces, relying on the people's communes, and fully leveraging the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, the heroic people bravely and tenaciously overcame this extraordinary disaster. Not only did no one starve to death or flee from famine, but they also quickly restored production and achieved a comprehensive and extraordinary bumper harvest in late-season agricultural production, realizing the magnificent slogan of "recovering a year's grain in one season" in many areas. Today, in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong, the spring breeze sweeps across the fields, with green waves rippling everywhere. The collapsed houses have all been repaired, and many newly built and tidy villages have emerged. It is truly "livestock thriving and people laughing" and "no trace of disaster, only new villages." Under the leadership of the Party, man will conquer nature, and the development of things will turn to its opposite. The Dongjiang area is even more beautiful than before.

Except for some rain recently, Guangdong has experienced a continuous drought for seven or eight months since last winter and this spring. Leinan and other counties have basically had no rain for fifteen months. However, this spring, the people of the province summarized the experience of overcoming the flood last year and launched a large-scale drought prevention and resistance movement. The masses put forward heroic slogans such as "conquering the god of heaven," "reversing the flow of water," "planting seedlings early even in drought," and "striving for a bumper harvest no matter what," and adopted various effective water conservancy measures. In particular, they launched a massive river blocking and damming campaign, blocking all the large and small rivers in the province except for the Pearl River estuary and the main stream of the Xijiang River in a very short period of time, diverting water for irrigation, enabling millions of mu of farmland in the province to be irrigated. While vigorously engaging in river blocking and damming, they also carried out water conservancy projects such as afforestation, river excavation and ditching, and sea blocking in order to fundamentally eliminate water and drought disasters and strive to achieve water conservancy as soon as possible, laying a solid foundation for increased grain production. The enormous achievements in agricultural production in Guangdong in recent years are the result of the arduous struggle of the broad masses of people against nature under the leadership of the Party, and the brilliant victory of the Party's general line for building socialism and the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation.

In the past two years, Guangdong's industry, especially basic industry, has been built from scratch, from small to large, from indigenous to modern, and a preliminary foundation has been laid in an all-round way. The face of industry has begun to undergo fundamental changes. For example, although steel production is currently limited by coke and cannot be produced more, the equipment capacity has reached a level of 500,000 tons per year, and the situation of "not having an inch of iron" and "relying on coal from other provinces" in the past has changed. Last year, our province produced 5.5 million tons of raw coal, an increase of more than 70 times compared with the annual output of 70,000 tons in 1949. The power industry, machinery industry, light industry, and chemical industry have also made great progress in the past two years. Transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, health, and scientific research have also developed rapidly accordingly.

Guangdong is China's main subtropical region, with abundant material resources and a long coastline. The chemical industry, petroleum industry, and non-ferrous metals have great development prospects, and the aquatic products industry and tropical economic crops have unique and superior conditions. To fully utilize these favorable conditions, we must resolutely implement the Central Committee's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined with each other. The tremendous achievements in agricultural production in Guangdong since liberation are the result of implementing the policy of focusing on agriculture, and the rapid development of industry and other undertakings in the past two years has also been driven by the rapid development of agriculture.

Like all parts of the country, the current situation in Guangdong is unprecedentedly good. The broad masses of people are full of energy and high spirits, and are launching themselves into the busy spring plowing with all their might, based on the tremendous achievements in farmland capital construction and preparations for spring plowing and production. They are determined to overcome the threat of drought and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in agriculture this year. In urban areas, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which is closely integrated with production and centered on gradually realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, semi-automation, and automation, is developing rapidly and vigorously on the industrial, transportation, finance and trade fronts. Moreover, this surging mass movement is intertwined with the upsurge of vigorously supporting agriculture, creating a very good situation. Facing such a great time, we are 100% confident in realizing the continued leap forward in 1960.

We recently convened a provincial six-level cadre meeting, which determined that rapidly developing agriculture should be the central task for a considerable period of time to come. The further consolidation of the people's communes is the most important guarantee for the development of agricultural production, and it is also one of the important keys to doing other work well. Therefore, at this meeting, comrades from the province, regions, counties, communes, and production teams seriously discussed the issue of people's communes. Everyone unanimously agreed that after the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes last year, the anti-rightist, encouragement of enthusiasm, and increased production and revenue movement, as well as the re-education of the socialist general line in the rural system of the province in the second half of the year, the people's communes in the province have become more sound and consolidated. In the coming period, the people's communes in the province will continue to implement the three-level ownership system based on production team ownership, which is suitable for the current level of production and the degree of awareness of the people. While relying on the production team as the main force for developing production, the economy run by the commune will continue to develop and grow stronger. The income of the commune-run enterprises currently accounts for about 15% of the income of the three-level ownership system of the people's communes in our province, and it will have greater development and account for a larger proportion after this year. The development of commune-run enterprises plays a significant role in developing productive forces, serving agriculture, serving national industry, and establishing commercial bases. It also plays an important role and significance in helping production teams develop production, especially helping production teams with low economic levels catch up with the wealthy teams with high economic incomes. At the same time, it also prepares conditions for the future transition from basic team ownership to basic commune ownership, and from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. Last year, 30% of the poor teams in the province had caught up with the level of the wealthy teams. This year, on the existing basis, we will enable about 70% to 80% of the poor teams to catch up with or approach the level of the wealthy teams, thereby greatly improving the productivity of the countryside, and on the basis of developing production, gradually increase people's incomes and improve people's material and cultural living standards. At the same time, we must better care for and run the public welfare undertakings of the commune, especially the public canteens.

We believe that "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" is the agricultural production policy that our province must resolutely implement in the next few years. Since liberation, due to our efforts to develop grain production, the grain situation has improved year by year, but it has not yet passed the threshold. Therefore, from this year to 1962, we must still concentrate our main efforts on grasping grain production. In 1960, we are required to guarantee the completion of the task of producing 40 billion catties of grain. By 1962, we will be able to strive to basically pass the grain threshold. At the same time, we must also achieve an all-round leap forward in the production of pigs, sugar, oil, fruits, vegetables, mulberries, hemp, fish, forests, rubber, etc., so as to adapt to the needs of industrial development and market supply, and bring greater prosperity to the entire economic construction.

In order to accelerate the development of agriculture, our province is vigorously implementing the policy of high yield and more harvesting and multiple planting and more harvesting. The province continues to carry out effective high-yield and bumper-harvest movements, popularizing and promoting existing high-yield experiences. For example, rice yields 1,000 catties per mu per season, sweet potatoes yield 10,000 to 20,000 catties, citrus fruits yield 2,000 to 3,000 catties, etc. In the future, we must continue to vigorously engage in high-yield areas, high-yield fields, and high-yield commune movements, and vigorously grasp backward fields and transform backward fields to ensure large-area balanced production increase. On the other hand, we must implement multiple planting and more harvesting, actively expand the planting area, and fully utilize all available land to develop production. Since last winter and this spring, our province has reclaimed 9 million mu of wasteland. After achieving the planned reclamation of 30 million mu of wasteland by 1962, the cultivated land area will increase by two-thirds compared with the existing 45 million mu. At that time, we will have more conditions to develop commodity grain, economic crops, tropical crops, oil crops, and animal husbandry, thereby promoting a huge change in the entire agricultural production.

In the past two years, our province has systematically implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" and achieved great results. In the future, we will continue to implement it more comprehensively and systematically. Based on the specific conditions of Guangdong, we must further strengthen farmland capital construction so that "water," "soil," and "fertilizer" can pass the threshold, and at the same time, cultivation techniques must catch up. Guangdong has abundant rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of 1,700 to 1,800 millimeters, but the rainfall is uneven. Often, either drought becomes a disaster or flood becomes a calamity. Since liberation, with the rapid development of water conservancy, the situation has changed year by year. In order to fundamentally control water and drought disasters, the province is building a large number of medium and small-sized water conservancy projects while implementing "small, storage, and mass" water conservancy, and paying attention to giving full play to the comprehensive utilization of these water conservancy projects. In order to better implement the "Eight-Character Constitution," advancing the season is of great significance in Guangdong. This spring, the season was advanced by another season compared with last year. Guangdong is a province with double-cropping rice cultivation. Advancing the season can appropriately extend the rice growing season, reduce pests, and for the early rice in southern Guangdong, it can avoid the attacks of the "Dragon Boat Water," changing the past proportion of "40% early rice and 60% late rice" in the yield of double-cropping rice in our province, so that the yield of early rice catches up with and exceeds late rice. At the same time, the planting period of late rice is also advanced accordingly, which enables the northern part of our province to avoid the attacks of the "cold dew wind," making the yield stable and improved. In this way, the entire agricultural production will gain more initiative. This year, in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," great progress has also been made in varietal improvement. The early season has promoted the short-stalk Nantek fine variety, and the yield can increase by 20% to 30% compared with ordinary seeds, and its characteristics are resistant to lodging, ensuring high yield. For the late rice planting, the province is preparing to fully promote the successfully tested fine variety "Three Shorts and One Autumn" (Tangpu Short, Shijiao Short, Short Seed Sticky, and Chengqiu No. 5) last year. Others, such as the famous "Thousand Grain Spike" cultivated by Yang Minghan and others, have been preliminarily successful and are still being cultivated.

Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is the key to realizing the continuous leap forward of agriculture in the future. Guangdong has a variety of crops, a high multiple cropping index, and a strong seasonality. Moreover, due to the systematic implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," the labor force needed to be put in is increasing more and more. The contradiction between the needs of the continuous great leap forward of agriculture and the backwardness of agricultural tools and the low labor productivity is becoming more and more obvious, and there is an urgent need to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture to solve this problem. The broad masses of commune members of the people's communes are even more eager for the day when "farming does not require cattle, and lighting does not require oil" to arrive as soon as possible. The technical transformation of agriculture in Guangdong takes a two-step approach. The first step is to realize semi-mechanization and partial mechanization, and the second step is to realize overall mechanization. From this year to 1962, we will focus on vigorously developing improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanization as the center of technical transformation: mainly focusing on the motorization of transportation tools, vehicles and ships; the improvement and semi-mechanization of farming tools; the motorization of animal husbandry and agricultural product processing tools; the semi-mechanization of farmland capital construction tools (such as water conservancy construction tools); and the semi-mechanization of tools for forestry, fishery, canteens, etc. This year, Guangdong plans to widely promote improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized tools, which will save about 30% of the agricultural labor force. At the same time, the province will take the suburbs of Guangzhou and the neighboring eight counties and cities as key demonstration areas, and basically realize mechanization and electrification before 1962. In order to realize these plans, before 1962, we will adopt the policy of combining indigenous and modern methods, and starting from indigenous methods to modern methods, seizing the main advanced machinery that can liberate a large number of laborers and is effective, and vigorously promote it. Transportation accounts for more than 40% of the agricultural labor force in the rural areas of Guangdong. Therefore, we have decided to manufacture a large number of ox carts, rubber-wheeled carts, and handcarts to reduce labor intensity, eliminate shoulder carrying, and save labor.

In order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, our province is vigorously strengthening industrial support for agriculture. During the water conservancy construction period last winter and this spring, the industrial sector produced a large number of water conservancy tools and equipment to support water conservancy construction, greatly accelerating the construction speed of water conservancy projects. This year, it is planned to transfer more than 50,000 tons of steel, more than 100,000 tons of cement, 500,000 cubic meters of wood, and other materials to support agriculture. In terms of the construction of agricultural machinery, we will establish a number of agricultural machinery factories with the Guangzhou Tractor Factory as the center. The province has designated 141 machinery factories as specialized factories for manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery. In the heavy industry investment, more than 70 million yuan of capital construction investment is directly used to support agriculture, and even more is indirectly serving agriculture. In addition, a large number of fertilizer and pesticide factories have been newly built, expanded, and renovated to produce a large number of fertilizers and pesticides by both indigenous and modern methods. County and commune industries should further play their role in serving agriculture, and supporting agriculture is the task of the whole Party and the whole people. Therefore, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, health and other departments are also contributing their strength to the rapid development of agriculture.

1960 is the first year of the 1960s and the third year of the continued leap forward of our country's socialist construction. In the face of the excellent situation, the people of our province will muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, establish lofty ambitions, and strive to overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan.

We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, adhering to the mass line, and carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation more extensively and deeply, and combining this movement with the movement to study Mao Zedong's works, to further improve the communist consciousness of the people, and more fully leverage their subjective initiative, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    战胜特大灾害  夺得特大丰收
    陈郁代表谈广东省生产建设的大好形势
    我完全拥护两位李副总理和谭副总理的报告，并保证把报告精神认真贯彻执行。
    广东省在党中央、毛主席正确领导下，几年来工农业生产和整个国民经济都有巨大的发展。大跃进以来，人们的精神面貌改变更大，生产力发展更快，社会主义建设速度空前加速。谁都知道，解放前广东在经济上是殖民地化程度比较严重的一个省份，粮食不足，仰赖洋米进口，解放后，由于执行了中央指示以农业为重点的方针，经过不断努力，到1953年已达到粮食自给，以后每年还调出部分粮食支援国家经济建设。在大跃进的1958年，全省粮食总产量达到三百二十亿斤，比1949年增加了一倍。1959年在特大水灾的袭击下，粮食产量不仅保持了1958年的水平，而且农业产值还比1958年增加了12％。这两年来，广东的农、林、牧、副、渔五业，都大大超过了解放前的最高水平。经济作物如甘蔗、花生、烤烟、黄麻等等比解放那一年增长一倍至十倍。农业生产面貌起了根本性的变化。1959年特大洪水是对广东人民又一次严重的考验。当时河源、惠阳、增城等县，一个月之内雨量达到一千几百公厘，东江、北江、西江的最大洪峰水位都超过几十年来最高的纪录。全省先后受淹稻田达五百八十万亩，损失粮食几十亿斤，房屋倒坍二十多万间。解放前如果碰上这样严重的自然灾害，不知有多少人处于饥寒交迫，流离失所，挣扎在死亡线上。但是这一回，英雄的人民在党的坚强领导下，在中央及全国各兄弟省的关怀、支援下，依靠人民公社，充分发挥人民公社的无比优越性，英勇顽强地战胜了这场特大的灾害，不但没有一个人饿死，一个人逃荒，而且迅速恢复了生产，取得了晚造农业生产的全面特大丰收，在许多地区都实现了“一造夺回一年粮”的雄伟口号。今日的广东东江地区，春风吹遍田野，到处绿波荡漾，倒坍的房屋已全部修复，出现了许多新建的整洁的村庄，真正是“六畜兴旺人欢笑”“灾痕不见见新村”。在党的领导下，人定胜天，事情的发展走向它的反面，东江地区比过去更加美丽了。
    广东除在最近开始下点雨外，去冬今春一连干旱了七、八个月，雷南等县十五个月基本没有下雨，但是，今年春间，全省人民总结了去年战胜洪水的经验，开展了大规模的防旱抗旱运动，群众提出“战胜天公”、“引水倒流”、“天旱也要提早把秧插下去”、“无论如何也要大丰收”等豪迈口号，并采取了各种各样有效的水利措施，特别是发动了声势浩大的拦河堵坝运动，在很短的时间内，就把全省除珠江下游和西江干流以外的大小河流全部封堵起来，引水灌溉，使全省几百万亩农田得以灌溉。在大搞拦河堵坝的同时，还开展了造林、开河挖渠、堵海等水利工程，以便从根本上消灭水旱灾害，争取早日实现水利化，为粮食增产打下稳固的基础。广东几年来农业生产获得如此巨大的成就，是广大群众在党的领导下，不断和自然界进行艰巨斗争的结果，是党的建设社会主义总路线和以农业为基础的方针的光辉胜利。
    两年来广东省工业特别是基础工业，已经从无到有，从小到大，从土到洋，全面打下了初步的基础，工业面貌已开始发生了根本的变化。如钢铁虽然目前由于焦炭所限，不能生产得更多，但设备能力已达到年产五十万吨的水平，过去“手无寸铁”、“靠外省煤吃饭”的局面，已经改变。我省去年生产了原煤五百五十万吨，与1949年年产七万吨比较，增长了七十多倍。电力工业、机械工业、轻工业和化学工业，这两年来也有很大的发展。交通运输、财贸、文教卫生、科学研究等事业也都相应地迅速发展起来。
    广东是我国主要的亚热带地区，物资资源丰富、海岸线长。化学工业、石油工业、有色金属等有很大的发展前途，而水产事业、热带经济作物等更有其得天独厚的优越条件，要充分利用这些有利条件，必须坚决地执行中央指示的以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的方针。广东解放以来农业生产的巨大成就是执行以农业为重点的方针的结果，这两年工业和其他事业的迅速发展也是农业的迅速发展带动起来的。
    正像全国各地一样，目前广东的形势空前良好，广大群众干劲冲天，意气风发，正以雷霆万钧之势，在农田基本建设和备耕生产取得巨大成绩的基础上，全力投入春耕大忙。决心战胜旱灾威胁，力争实现今年农业的更大跃进。在城镇方面，与生产紧密结合，以逐步实现机械化、半机械化、半自动化、自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在工业、交通、财贸等战线上迅速而猛烈地开展。而且这个汹涌澎湃的群众运动又和大力支援农业的热潮交织一起，造成了一个非常好的形势，面对这样的大好时光，我们对实现1960年的持续跃进信心百倍。
    我们最近召开过全省六级干部会议，确定了迅速发展农业作为今后相当时期的中心任务。人民公社的进一步巩固，是发展农业生产的最重要的保证，同时也是做好其他工作的重要关键之一。因此，这次会议省、地、县、社、生产队的同志们在一起又认真的商量和讨论了人民公社的问题，大家一致认为人民公社经过去年的整顿巩固和反右倾、鼓干劲与超产多收运动，及下半年全省农村系统的社会主义总路线的再教育，全省人民公社已更加健全和巩固。在今后一个时期内，全省人民公社将继续实行以生产队所有制为基础的三级所有制，这是适合于目前时期生产水平和人民群众的觉悟程度的。在以生产队作为发展生产的主要依靠的同时，社办经济将不断发展和壮大起来。社办企业收入目前占我省人民公社三级所有制收入的15％左右，今年以后将有更大的发展而占更大的比重。社办企业的发展对于发展生产力，为农业服务，为国家工业服务，建立商业基地，都有重大的作用。对于帮助生产队发展生产，特别是帮助经济水平低的生产队赶上经济收入水平高的富队，也有重要的作用和意义。同时它还为将来由基本队有制过渡到基本社有制，由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制准备条件。全省人民公社去年已有30％的穷队赶上了富队的水平，今年要在现有基础上使70％到80％左右的穷队赶上或接近富队水平，从而大大提高农村的生产力，并且在发展生产的基础上，使人民收入逐步增加，提高人民的物质文化生活水平。同时要更好地关心和办好公社的公共福利事业，特别是办好公共食堂。
    我们认为“以粮为纲，全面跃进”是我省今后几年必须坚决执行的农业生产方针。解放以来由于我们抓紧了发展粮食生产，粮食情况逐年有所改善，但还没有过关。因此由今年到1962年，我们仍要集中主要力量，抓好粮食生产。1960年要求保证完成生产粮食四百亿斤的任务。到1962年就能争取粮食基本过关。在这同时，还必须使猪、糖、油、果、菜、桑、麻、渔、林、橡胶等项生产全面跃进，这样才能适应工业发展和市场供应的需要，给整个经济建设带来更大的繁荣。
    为了加速农业的发展，我省正在大力实行高产多收和多种多收的方针。全省在继续开展行之有效的高额丰产运动，普及和推广现有的高产经验。如水稻一造亩产千斤，甘薯一、二万斤，柑桔二、三千斤等等。今后仍要继续不断地大搞高产片、高产垌、高产社运动，并且大抓落后田，改造落后田，以保证大面积均衡增产。另一方面，要实行多种、多收、积极扩大种植面积，充分利用一切能够利用的土地来发展生产。去冬今春我省已开荒九百万亩，到1962年按计划实现开垦荒地三千万亩以后，耕地面积就会比现有四千五百万亩增加三分之二，那时将有更多的条件来发展商品粮食、经济作物、热带作物、油料作物和畜牧业等等，从而促致整个农业生产的巨大变化。
    两年多来，我省系统地贯彻“八字宪法”取得了很大成绩，今后将继续全面地更系统地贯彻。根据广东具体情况，必须进一步加强农田基本建设，使“水”、“土”、“肥”过关，同时栽培技术要赶上去。广东雨量充沛，每年平均降雨量为一千七、八百公厘，但雨量不均匀，往往不是干旱成灾就是洪水为患。解放后随着水利事业的迅速发展，情况逐年改变。为了根治水旱灾害，全省在实行“小、蓄、群”办水利的同时，还修建了大批中小型水利工程，并注意发挥这些水利工程综合利用的作用。为了更好的贯彻“八字宪法”，在广东提早季节有重大意义。今春比去年又提早一个季节。广东是双季水稻连作省份，提早季节既可以适当延长水稻生长期，减少虫害，而对广东南部地区早稻则可以避过“龙舟水”的袭击，把我省过去双季稻产量“早四晚六”的比例改变过来，使早稻产量赶上和超过晚稻。同时晚稻种植期也相应提早，这就使我省北部地区可以避过“寒露风”的袭击，使产量获得稳定和提高。这样，全部农业生产就更赢得了主动。今年贯彻“八字宪法”中在良种化方面也大大前进了一步，早造推广了矮脚南特良种，产量可以比普通种籽增产二、三成以上，而且它的特性能抗倒伏，使高产有保证。晚稻的种植全省准备全面推广去年试验成功的良种“三矮一秋”（塘埔矮、石角矮、矮籽粘及澄秋5号）。其他如杨明汉等培育的有名的“千粒穗”已初步成功，仍在继续培育。
    加速农业的技术改造，是今后实现农业持续不断跃进的关键。广东作物品种多样，复种率高，季节性很强，而且由于系统贯彻“八字宪法”，需要投放的劳动力越来越多，农业持续大跃进的需要与农业工具落后和劳动生产率低下的矛盾愈加明显地表现出来，迫切要求加速农业技术改造来解决这个问题。广大的人民公社社员更渴望着“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油”的日子早日到来。广东农业技术改造采取两步走的办法，第一步实现半机械化和部分机械化，第二步实现全盘机械化。从今年起到1962年，以大搞改良农具和半机械化作为技术改造的中心：主要搞运输工具车船化；耕作工具改良化和半机械化；畜牧业、农产品加工工具动力化；农田基本建设工具（如水利施工工具）的半机械化；林业、渔业、食堂等用具的半机械化。今年广东计划广泛推广改良农具和半机械化工具，这将可节省30％左右的农业劳动力。同时，全省将以广州市郊及邻近八个县市作为重点示范区，在1962年前基本实现机械化和电气化。为了实现这些计划，1962年以前，将采取土洋并举，由土到洋的方针，因地制宜地抓住主要的能解放大批劳动力，而且是行之有效的先进机具，大力推广。运输在广东农村占农业劳动力达40％以上，因此，我们决定大量制造牛车、胶轮车、手推车等，以减轻劳动强度，消灭肩挑，节约劳动力。
    为了加速农业的技术改造，我省已在大力加强工业对农业的支援。去冬今春水利建设期间，工业部门就生产了大批水利工具和器材，支援水利建设，大大加速了水利工程的建设速度。今年计划调出钢材五万余吨，水泥十万余吨，木材五十万立方米和其他物资等支援农业。在农业机械的建设方面，将以广州拖拉机厂为中心，建立一批农业机械厂。全省已划出一百四十一间机械厂作为制造和修配农业机械的专业工厂。在重工业投资中，直接用于支援农业的基建投资七千多万元，间接为农业服务的更多。此外，还新建和扩建、改建了大批化肥、农药厂，以土办法和洋办法生产大批化肥和农药。县社工业要进一步发挥其为农业服务的作用，支援农业是全党全民的任务。因此，交通运输、财贸、文教卫生等部门，也都正在为迅速发展农业而贡献自己的力量。
    1960年是六十年代的第一年，是我国社会主义建设继续跃进的第三年，在大好形势面前，我们全省人民，将鼓足更大的革命干劲，树立雄心大志，为超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    我们相信，在党中央的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，依靠总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，更加广泛深入地开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。并使这一运动与学习毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，以进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟，更充分地发挥他们的主观能动性，我们就一定能够克服任何困难，实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
