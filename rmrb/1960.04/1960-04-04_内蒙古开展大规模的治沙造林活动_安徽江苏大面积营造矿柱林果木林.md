Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Dispatch: People of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia near the desert areas have launched a large-scale desert control and afforestation campaign. By mid-March, the region had afforested more than 690,000 mu and collected more than 1.2 million jin of various grass and tree seeds for sand fixation and afforestation. State-owned desert control stations and forest farms have also prepared nearly one billion saplings.

	In the large desert areas of Ulan Buh and Kubuqi in the west, aerial seeding experiments for grass cultivation were conducted on 740,000 mu last year, and according to recent observations, the results are good. This year, large-scale aerial seeding work is about to begin, and airport renovation, technical personnel training, and seed and equipment preparation are currently underway.

	The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of the regions with a large desert area in China. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the desert area made great achievements in their march toward the desert. Many places that used to be rolling sand dunes are now shaded by green trees and filled with cattle and sheep.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: Anhui Province, in its large-scale afforestation campaign, implemented the provincial party committee's instruction on "grasping economic forests and fruit trees while focusing on timber forests." From November last winter to the present, the province has afforested more than 24 million mu, exceeding the winter-spring afforestation plan by 100%. Vigorously developing community-run forest farms and establishing forestry bases at a high speed are prominent features of Anhui Province's afforestation work this year. Areas near the Huainan and Huaibei coal mines have established 800,000 mu of mine prop forest bases; the sandy wasteland in the old course of the Yellow River is suitable for fruit tree growth, so a large number of fruit tree forests have been planted; in the mountainous areas of southern and western Anhui, where the climate is warm and rainfall is abundant, a large number of Chinese fir forest bases have been established in a planned way. Among the various forestry bases, mine prop forests, woody oil materials, and fruit tree forests, which grow quickly and have high economic value, account for a large proportion. According to incomplete statistics, among the 16.93 million mu of timber forests that have been created in the province, Chinese fir, bamboo, mine prop forests, and other fast-growing tree species account for more than 60%; economic forests account for more than 5.12 million mu, of which the four major woody oil materials—oil tea, walnut, tung oil tree, and Chinese tallow tree—and mulberry trees account for 60%; fruit tree forests account for more than 1.99 million mu, of which the five major fruits—apple, pear, grape, citrus, and loquat—account for more than 42%. The vast afforestation army in various parts of the province is now continuing to expand its achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: Since last winter, Jiangsu Province has created 660,000 mu of mine prop forests, opening up broad avenues for self-sufficiency in mine prop timber in the future.

	The Xuhuai area of Jiangsu is rich in mineral resources and is one of China's major coal-producing areas. In recent years, the coal industry has continued to leap forward, and the demand for mine props has also continued to grow. However, Jiangsu Province lacks forest resources, and the large quantities of mine prop timber needed each year are all transported from distant provinces. If timber cannot be delivered in time, it will directly affect the production of the coal industry. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee decided to build mine prop forests on a large scale on the sandy wasteland, beaches, and barren mountains in counties and cities near the mining areas. Since last winter, three successive campaigns have been organized, and four major mine prop forest bases have been created in the Hongze Lake area, the Gaoyou Baoying Lake area, and along the Longhai Railway and the Yellow Sea coast, planting a large number of locust, poplar, and willow trees.

	The mine prop forests created in various places are concentrated in large areas, with great momentum, good specifications, and high quality. The general area is more than 10,000 mu. The largest lake beach mine prop forest in Sihong County covers 70,000 mu, stretching as far as the eye can see. Such large-scale contiguous afforestation facilitates management, can improve afforestation quality, promote rapid and high yields of trees, and facilitate future harvesting and transportation, saving investment and reducing production costs.

    内蒙古开展大规模的治沙造林活动  安徽江苏大面积营造矿柱林果木林
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古各沙漠区附近的各族人民展开了大规模的治沙造林活动。到3月中旬，全区已造林六十九万多亩，采集各种固沙造林用的草木籽种一百二十多万斤。各国营治沙站、林场还准备了近十亿株树苗。
    西部乌兰布和、库布齐等大沙漠地带，去年进行了七十四万亩的飞机播种育草试验，据最近观察，效果良好。今年，大面积的飞机播种工作即将开始，现在正在整修机场，培训技术人员，准备籽种和器材。
    内蒙古自治区是我国沙漠面积较大的地区之一。解放后，沙漠区各族人民在党的领导下，向沙漠大进军取得了很大成绩，许多以往流沙滚滚的地方，如今已是绿树成荫，牛羊遍野。
  据新华社合肥讯　安徽省各地在大规模造林运动中，贯彻了省委关于“在大抓用材林的同时，大抓经济林和果树”的指示，自去冬11月份到现在，全省已造林二千四百多万亩，超额一倍完成了一冬一春造林计划；大搞社办林场、大建林业基地，高速度发展林业生产，是安徽省今年造林工作的显著特征。淮南和淮北煤矿附近地区，建立八十多万亩的矿柱林基地；黄河故道地区的沙荒地带，适宜于果木生长，就栽了大量的果木林；在气候温暖，雨量充沛的皖南、皖西等山区宜林地带，有计划地建立了大量的杉木林基地。在各种林业基地中，其中成材快，经济价值高的矿柱林，木本油料和果木林占了很大比重。据不完全统计，全省已营造的一千六百九十三万亩用材林中，杉木、竹子、矿柱林及其他速生树种占60％以上；营造经济林五百一十二万多亩，其中油茶、核桃、油桐、乌桕四大木本油料和桑树占60％；营造果木林一百九十九万多亩，其中苹果、梨、葡萄、柑桔、枇杷等五大主要果品占42％以上。全省各地广大造林大军，现正在继续扩大战果。
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省从去冬以来已经营造了六十六万亩矿柱林，为今后矿柱用材自给自足开辟了广阔道路。
    江苏徐淮地区矿藏丰富，是我国主要产煤区之一。近年来，煤炭工业不断跃进，矿柱需要量也随着不断增长。但是江苏省森林资源缺乏，历年所需大批矿柱用材，都依靠外省远途运来。木材不能及时运到，就会直接影响煤炭工业的生产。因此，中共江苏省委决定在矿区附近各县市的沙荒、荒滩和荒山上大造矿柱林。去冬以来，先后组织三次突击，已在洪泽湖区、高邮宝应湖区和沿陇海路、黄海边营造了四大矿柱林基地，种植了大量洋槐、白杨、柳树等。
    各地营造的矿柱林，连片集中，气魄大，规格好，质量高。一般面积都在万亩以上。泗洪县最大的一块湖滩矿柱林，方圆七万亩，一望无际。这样大面积连片造林，便于经营管理，可以提高造林质量，促进林木快速丰产；便于将来采伐运输，节约投资，降低生产成本。
