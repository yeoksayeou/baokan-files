    Theoretical Study Improves My Business Skills
    Sun Yinrong, Salesperson at Heping Road Department Store, Tianjin
    I am a salesperson in a retail store. In the past, I always thought that studying theory was a matter for experts and professors. I thought I was not educated enough to study theory; besides, I was busy all day long and had no time to study theory.
    At the end of 1958, I was entrusted by young comrades and was honored to attend the Second National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. During the meeting, I heard Comrade Qiao Shuhua, a salesperson from the Seventh Department Store in Harbin, introduce her experience in studying Chairman Mao's works and doing a good job. This gave me great inspiration and encouragement, and reversed my previous incorrect view of studying theory. After returning to Tianjin, with the encouragement, support, and help of the Party and Youth League organizations, I developed a study plan with "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" as its basic content. In the short period of more than a year, studying Chairman Mao's works has broadened my horizons and greatly improved my ideology, theory, and business skills.
    After studying "On Contradiction," I understood the principle that to correctly handle contradictions, I must analyze both the universality of contradictions and the particularity of contradictions. This has made me more thorough and accurate in understanding the psychology of customers and predicting changes in their psychology than before. When selling goods, I regard the common characteristic of customers coming to buy things as the generality (the universality of contradiction), and the different preferences of customers determined by their different ages and occupations as the individuality (the particularity of contradiction). With the help of the Party and comrades, I have explored the characteristics of preferences: workers generally like to wear beautiful colors, farmers need sturdy and bright colors, and students like to use economical and simple items. In addition, I have also analyzed several different psychological states, such as being confident and having normal needs, intending to buy but being hesitant, etc. When selling goods, I recommend products according to different body types, preferences, and psychological states, so that customers are satisfied. For example, one noon, two men and two women rural customers came. Judging from their appearance and expressions, a young couple were engaged, one was the woman's sister, and one was the man's father. At that time, the woman picked out two woolen tops in a row and wanted to buy a silk one, but the man said it didn't look good, and the woman's sister said, "The color isn't bad, buy this one!" At this time, a contradiction arose between them. I thought that at this moment, the salesperson should help them resolve this contradiction. I further analyzed their dialogue, considering that when rural people come to buy dowries, the woman usually chooses and the man pays. Looking at the situation today, it is possible that the man didn't bring a lot of money and was embarrassed to not let the woman buy, so he said the color didn't look good. But the decision to buy or not was still with the woman, so to resolve this contradiction, I first had to resolve the woman's problem. So I said to them, "The weather will get colder day by day, and you won't be able to wear silk clothes even if you buy them. Why don't you pick two cloth ones to wear alternately first, and wait until the weather is warmer to pick a new style? Now you are getting married, which is a big deal, and there are places where you need money. Wouldn't it be better to save this money to buy some useful things?" After hearing this, the woman's sister smiled and said, "That's right, we really won't be able to wear it even if we buy it, and it will just end up at the bottom of the chest. We'll take these two cloth ones!" After they left, the young male customer came back to me and said, "Comrade, you are so good at handling things. Your words really hit the spot. You are a really good salesperson!"
    Analyzing specific problems and solving them specifically. This is an effective working method I learned in "On Contradiction." Applying it to helping customers solve difficulties has yielded some gains. On the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month last year at noon, an old farmer came to the counter and said, "My son is getting married on the sixteenth day of the twelfth lunar month..." Then he handed me a small note with the following written on it: one set each of woolen underwear and trousers, one set each of shirts and underpants, one pair each of cotton shoes and single shoes, and one vest, a total of more than ten items. I was about to take the items according to the list, but I couldn't. Besides the size 36 shoes and size 85 vest, I couldn't find any other sizes or specifications. I asked the old man, "Have you seen your daughter-in-law? How tall, how fat?" Before I could finish, the old man interrupted, "Who knows what she looks like? I've never seen her. My son gave me this note, so I came. Just take the items according to the list!" This stumped me. I thought, he hasn't seen the person and doesn't have the sizes, how can I get the items? Then I thought, as a public servant of the people and an organizer of the people's lives, how can I just leave people alone when they have difficulties? I remembered that I should analyze specific problems and solve them specifically, and try every possible way to solve this difficulty for the old man. I considered that the height of most couples is generally that the man is slightly taller than the woman, so I asked the old man how tall his son was, and then used his son's height to predict his daughter-in-law's height. At the same time, I judged from the clue of the size 36 shoes on the note that his daughter-in-law was about one meter four tall, but I couldn't be sure about her weight. At this time, I remembered the size 85 vest. It was possible that the old man had mistakenly written eighty centimeters as size 85. Therefore, I determined the waist size of this piece of clothing according to the general need for rural women to wear clothes that are a little bigger. In order to make the clothes fit, I also found Comrade Xiao Zhong from the group's "Third Set of Live Models" to try them on in place of the old man's daughter-in-law. As a result, a shirt was selected. I then went from upstairs to downstairs to get most of the items on the list for the old man. Finally, in order to buy a pair of purple cotton shoes, I obtained the consent of the group leader and led the old man to the Quanyechang area to choose them. After everything was bought, when I sent him to the streetcar, the old man said with emotion, "After returning home, I will first bow to Chairman Mao. If it weren't for this era, there wouldn't be such good salespersons!" When he got on the streetcar, he also told me his address, insisting that I go to his home in Huanghua County to eat wedding noodles on the sixteenth day of the twelfth lunar month.
    Everything is developing and changing. With the development of social production, market conditions and consumer needs are also changing. Customers like to wear small and thin clothes this year, but they like to wear big and fat clothes next year; they like bright colors this year, but they may like plain colors next year. With this change in consumer needs, it is necessary to constantly add new varieties to meet customers' new requirements. If the supply of goods cannot keep up, there will be contradictions between supply and demand and between salespersons and customers. After studying "On Contradiction," I often paid attention to understanding the changes in consumer needs, especially the changes in the needs of farmers after the establishment of people's communes, and did the supply work ahead of the needs of the masses. I and the comrades in the group studied the advanced experience of Guangfu Road Store and Comrade Zhang Shizhen in organizing the people's economic life and being a good "housekeeper." With the support of the Party, in the spirit of internal solicitation, external visits, going to thousands of homes, visiting ten thousand people, carrying out activities while improving, we conducted multifaceted understanding, visits, and investigations. Through selling goods at the counter while visiting, and going to the countryside to understand households, we visited 698 people and solicited 357 opinions in just over twenty days before the Spring Festival, which gave us a new understanding of the changes in the needs of suburban farmers. For example, in the past, I thought that farmers generally needed uniforms of lower quality, and most of them liked cotton jackets. However, after visiting, I realized that the needs of farmers had changed greatly. They not only needed uniforms of higher quality, but also the most fashionable fleece-edged cotton jackets and large round-neck cotton jackets. According to the changes in the needs of suburban farmers and the requirements of customers of all classes for clothing styles, we designed more than 100 clothing styles and revised more than 1,000 clothing specifications. At the same time, we also cooperated with processing workers and suggested to brother groups to arrange the production of more than 2,000 large round-neck and fleece-edged cotton jackets. This overcame the one-sidedness of the group's existing method of organizing purchases, which was based solely on their own subjective preferences instead of the objective needs of customers, and turned the purchasing work from passive to active.
    In the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, although our group made great improvements in business management, we still did not understand the requirements of customers from all walks of life thoroughly enough, and some varieties of goods were not suitable, which made the inventory unreasonable and the capital turnover slow. This directly affected our efforts to improve business management and better organize the people's economic life. Through studying "On Practice," we understood the relationship between objective laws and subjective initiative, and studied the group's business management, and conducted objective analysis and subjective examination of the reasons for the slow capital turnover. As a result, we found the problem: because the group leader "dominated" the purchase, sales, and accounting, and only the salesperson "managed" the variety arrangement, there was no broad mass base, which limited the play of each comrade's subjective initiative, so the inventory was large and the varieties were incomplete. In order to solve this problem quickly, I learned about and studied the "Seven Business Management Experiences of Tianqiao" that I brought back from the National Congress of Heroes, and together with the comrades, formulated five business management systems, which were implemented in the group, giving full play to everyone's subjective initiative and making everyone care about the group's business. Therefore, the unreasonable inventory was compressed and the capital turnover was accelerated.
    In my study process, the Party organization and comrades have always been very concerned, valued, and supportive. Although my study gains are only this little, they have given me great confidence and strength to persist in studying. I am determined to continue to work hard and diligently, to arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, further improve my work ability, and serve the people diligently and conscientiously in my glorious position.

    理论学习提高了我的业务能力
    天津市和平路百货商店售货员　孙荫蓉
    我是一个零售商店的售货员，过去我一直认为学习理论是专家、教授们的事情，我
  自己的文化浅、水平低，学习不了理论；再说，一天忙到晚，那有功夫学理论。
    1958年年底，我接受了青年同志们的委托，光荣地出席了全国第二次青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，在会议期间，听到了哈尔滨市第七百货商店售货员乔淑华同志介绍了关于学习毛主席著作，做好工作的经验；给自己很大的启发和鼓舞，扭转了我以前对学习理论的不正确看法。回到天津以后，在党、团组织的鼓励、支持和帮助下，我订出了以“矛盾论”、“实践论”为基本内容的学习规划。在短短一年多的过程中，通过学习毛主席著作，使我开阔了眼界，在思想上理论上和业务能力上，都有了很大的提高。
    学习了“矛盾论”，懂得了要正确处理矛盾，必须既分析矛盾的普遍性，又分析矛盾的特殊性的道理，使我在体贴顾客心理、预测顾客心理变化上，比以前更加深入确切了。在售货时，我就把顾客都是来买东西的特点，看成是共性（矛盾的普遍性），把顾客们因为年龄不同、职业不同而决定的爱好不同，看成是个性（矛盾的特殊性）。在党和同志们的帮助下，我就摸索出，一般工人喜欢穿颜色漂亮的，农民需要结实色艳的，学生爱用经济朴素的等爱好特点。另外还分析出，胸有成竹、正常需要的，打算要买、犹豫不定等几种不同的心理。在售货时，根据体型、爱好和心理的不同，分别推荐商品，使顾客称心满意。例如有一天中午来了两男两女农村顾客，从模样和说话表情来看，一对青年男女是未婚夫妇，还有一个是女方的姐姐，一个是男方的父亲。当时，女方一连挑了两件线呢上衣，还想买一件绸料的，这时男方一看，就说不好看，而女方的姐姐说：“色不难看，买这件吧！”这时，在他们之间就产生了矛盾。我想，在这个当口，售货员就应当帮助他们解决这个矛盾。我便进一步分析了他们的对话，考虑到，农村来买嫁妆时，都是女方挑选，男方花钱。看今天这个情况，可能是男方带的钱不大富裕，自己又不好意思不叫女方买，所以才说颜色不好看。但是确定买与不买还在女方，因此要解决这个矛盾，首先要解决女方的问题，这时我就对她们说：“往后天气一天比一天凉了，绸料的衣服买了也穿不着，您不如先挑两件布的倒换着穿，等以后天气暖和了，再挑件新花样的也不算晚；现在您又是结婚办大事，那儿不用钱，省下这笔钱买一些当用的东西不是更好吗？”女方的姐姐听了后，笑着说：“对了，买了确实也穿不着，也就落个压箱底，就要这两件布的吧！”当他们买走了以后，那位青年男顾客又回来对我说：“同志，你太会办事了，你的话真说到人心坎上了，你真是一个好售货员！”
    具体问题，具体分析，具体解决。这是我在“矛盾论”中学到的一种行之有效的工作方法，把它运用在帮助顾客解决困难上，取得了一些收获。在去年腊月初八中午，一位农民老大爷走到柜台前说：“腊月十六要娶儿媳妇……。”随着就递给我一个小条，上面写着：绒衣、绒裤、衬衣、衬裤各一身，棉鞋、单鞋各一双，背心一件共十多种商品。当时我就要照单拿，可是一伸手却没法拿，条子上除了36号鞋85号的背心外，其它再也找不出尺寸和规格来。我就向老大爷打听说：“您看见过您的儿媳妇吗？多高、多胖？……”没等我说完，老大爷便抢着说：“谁知道她是嘛样的，俺一次也没见过，俺儿子给我这个条我就来了，你就看着条拿吧！”这可把我给难住了，当时我就想：他没见人，又没有尺寸，叫我怎么拿？又想：做一个人民的勤务员、群众生活的组织者，当人们有了困难的时候，哪能甩手不管呢？我就想起来应该做到具体问题，具体分析，具体解决，想尽一切办法给老大爷解决这个困难。我考虑到：一般夫妇的高矮，大多是男的比女的略高一些，于是，向老大爷打听他儿子有多高，然后，通过他儿子的高度来预测他儿媳妇的高矮。同时，我又根据条子上写着的36号鞋的线索，判断出他的儿媳妇大约有一米四的高矮，但胖、瘦，还肯定不了。这时，我又想起85号的背心，可能是老大爷把八十公分错记成八十五号了，因此，我就根据农村妇女穿衣服一般的需要肥大一点的特点，确定这件衣服的腰肥。为了让衣服穿着合体，我又找到了组内的“第三套活样板”小钟同志，代替老大爷儿媳妇穿试，结果选成了一件衬衫。又从楼上到楼下把条上的一切东西，大部分都给老大爷拿齐了。最后，为了买一双紫色棉鞋，征得了组长的同意，我又领着老大爷到劝业场一带去挑选。把一切买妥，当我把他送上电车时，老大爷感动地说：“回家后先给毛主席鞠个躬，不是这年头，那有这样好的售货员！”上车时他还把地址告诉我，一定要我在腊月十六那天，去黄骅县到他家中吃喜面。
    一切事物都是在发展变化的，随着社会生产的发展，市场情况和消费需要也在变化着。顾客们对服装式样的要求，今年喜欢穿小的、瘦的，明年又喜欢穿肥的、大的；今年喜欢鲜艳的，明年可能又喜欢素色的。随着消费者这种需要变化，就需要不断地增添新品种，来满足顾客们新的要求，如果商品供应跟不上，就产生了供需之间和售货员与顾客之间的矛盾。学习了“矛盾论”以后，我才经常注意了解消费者需要的变化，特别是农村成立人民公社以后农民需要的变化，把供应工作做在群众需要的前头。我和组内的同志们，学习了光复道商店和张士珍同志组织好人民经济生活，当好“管家人”的先进经验。在党的支持下，本着内征求、外访问、走千家、访万人、边活动、边改进的精神，进行了多方面的了解、访问和调查。通过柜台售货时的随卖货随访问，和下农村的入户了解，仅在春节前二十多天的时间内，就访问了六百九十八人，征求了三百五十七条意见，使我们对郊区农民需要的变化，有了新的认识。例如：过去我认为，农民们穿制服，一般的需要质量次一些的；穿棉服大多数喜欢棉夹克。可是经过访问，才知道农民的需要大有变化，他们不仅需要穿质量高一些的制服，而且还需要最时兴的绒边棉夹克和大圆领棉夹克。根据郊区农民需要的变化，和各阶层顾客对服装式样的要求，我们设计出一百多种服装式样，修改了一千多件服装规格，同时还配合加工员，建议兄弟组，安排生产了大圆领和绒边棉夹克两千多件。从而克服了小组在组织进货方法上存在的单凭自己主观爱好，代替顾客客观需要的片面性，使进货工作由被动转为主动。
    我们小组在1958年和1959年大跃进当中，在经营管理上，虽然有了很大程度的改善，但是，由于对各界顾客的要求摸得还不够透彻，在商品经营上还有些品种不大对路，因此使库存不够合理，资金周转较慢，这样，就直接影响了我们改善经营管理，和更好地组织人民经济生活。通过学习“实践论”，我们了解了客观规律与主观能动性之间的关系，对小组经营管理进行了研究，对资金周转较慢的原因，进行了客观上的分析和主观上的检查。结果找出了毛病是：因为在进销算账时，只是组长一人“独揽”，在品种安排上，只是由业务员一个人“专管”，所以没有广泛的群众基础，限制了每个同志的主观能动性的发挥，因此库存较大，品种不全。为了迅速解决这个问题，我把从全国群英会带回来的“天桥七项经营管理经验”，通过学习和研究，和同志们一起，制定了五项经营管理制度，在小组内执行后，充分发挥了大家的主观能动作用，做到了人人关心小组经营，因此压缩了不合理的库存，使资金周转加速。
    在我的学习过程中，党组织和同志们一直是非常的关怀、重视和支持，我学习的收获虽然只有这么一点，可是却给了我坚持学下去很大的信心和力量，我决心继续努力，刻苦钻研，要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，进一步提高工作能力，在自己光荣的岗位上，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务。
