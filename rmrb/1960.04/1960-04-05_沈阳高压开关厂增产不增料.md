    Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory Increases Production Without Increasing Materials
    In the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, put forward the slogan "Increase production without increasing materials, one ton is equivalent to two tons," determined to use 60%-70% of the raw materials allocated by the state to complete 100%-110% of the production tasks. Their methods are: First, reform product design. For example, the explosion-proof switch used in mines saves more than 40% of steel, copper, and insulating glue per unit. Second, vigorously develop new products that are economical in materials and advanced in performance. For example, a new product can be produced with three units using the steel material of one old product. Third, concentrate blanking and carry out multi-part cutting, which can save 10% of steel, 5% of non-ferrous metal materials, 3% of insulation materials, and 10% of wood per year.

    沈阳高压开关厂增产不增料
    沈阳高压开关厂在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中，为了克服原材料不足的困难，提出“增产不增料，一吨顶两吨”的口号，决心用国家分配的60％—70％的原材料，完成100％—110％的生产任务。他们的做法是：一、改革产品设计。如矿山用的防爆开关，每台节约的钢材、铜材、绝缘胶都达40％以上。二、大力发展用料经济、性能先进的新产品。如有一种新产品，用一台老产品的钢铁材料，可以生产三台。三、集中下料，大搞套裁，这样一年可节约钢材10％，有色金属材料5％，绝缘材料3％，木材10％。
