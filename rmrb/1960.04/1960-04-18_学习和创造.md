Learning and Creation
Li Jianyun

    A vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is unfolding throughout the country, with stories of mutual learning and invention emerging like a rising tide and a race of a hundred rivers. Lu Sheng, a milling worker at the Dalian 工矿 Vehicle Factory in Liaoning Province, said, "Whoever I meet is my teacher; wherever I go is a school." In the six and a half years from 1953 to the first half of 1959, he innovated 125 technologies, completed eleven years' worth of work, and consecutively won the title of advanced producer fifteen times. The Ma Wanshui group of eighty workers at the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei learned from anyone who mastered a new technology, both within their group and from outside groups and other regions. Learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced became a common practice. As a result, they created more than 200 advanced experiences in ten years, consistently overfulfilling their plans every month, and have remained the red banner for tunneling in the national ferrous metal mines. Ma Xueli, the famous labor model and adjustment worker at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory in Hubei Province, was able to "learn from every advancement." In the past year alone, he proposed more than 300 innovation suggestions. ...This communist virtue of combining humble learning with bold creation reflects the spiritual outlook of a new generation growing up under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. This spirit is increasingly bursting forth with sparks, and it is the style of our great leaping era.

    Learning and creation are mutually reinforcing. Only by being modest and eager to learn, and diligent in asking questions, can we create more, better, and more ingeniously; any major creation cannot be separated from humble learning. Recently, many workers in Shanghai have been inspired by everyday life, such as children swinging, vegetable weighing in small markets, making pastries in pastry shops, patterns on matchboxes, etc., and have innovated and created many things. This fully demonstrates that all innovation and creation utilizes the labor results of predecessors and others. It is unimaginable for a person to separate themselves from the collective and rely entirely on their own to engage in innovation and creation. Moreover, technical innovation and technical revolution are endless, always developing from small to large, from simple to complex, from rough to fine, and from low-level to high-level. Every development is a creation. It does not mean that once someone has created something, it has reached its peak, and others can no longer continue to create in that area. On the contrary, learning from others' experiences can inspire us to solve the difficulties in our own innovation and creation. At the same time, we can also discover the imperfections in others' creations and improve or innovate upon them, so that the original innovation and creation can be continuously improved and refined. As everyone knows, fruit trees need to be grafted with other varieties in order to improve the quality of the fruit. A person also needs to constantly learn and absorb the experiences of others in order to make their own experience richer, more advanced, and more perfect, and more and better innovations and creations will be produced. Therefore, learning and creation are not mutually exclusive. Learning from others will not hinder one's own creativity, but can further enhance it. The broad masses of our country deeply understand this principle. In order to accelerate the cause of socialist construction, everyone is working hard, everyone is diligently studying, daring to think, speak, and act, boldly experimenting and creating, while also humbly learning from the advanced experiences of others, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is developing rapidly day by day. However, some people still have some misconceptions about the relationship between learning and creation. Some people have the idea of not seeking help from others in everything. They like to be teachers and are ashamed to learn from others. Therefore, they just create behind closed doors and never learn from others. This is very harmful. The ancients said: "Be quick to learn and not ashamed to ask those below." If we want to truly engage in an important innovation and creation and make some achievements, we must humbly learn from others. First of all, we must learn from the older generation of veteran workers. Mencius has a saying: "The skill of Gongshuzi cannot make a square or circle without the compass and square; the sharpness of Shi Kuang's hearing cannot correct the five tones without the six pitch-pipes." The so-called "compass and square" are the summary of experience accumulated by veteran craftsmen in long-term labor practice; the so-called "six pitch-pipes" are also the summary of experience accumulated by veteran musicians in long-term musical practice. A person's life is limited, while the depth of scientific knowledge is infinite. This is a contradiction. If we do not inherit and learn from the experiences of our predecessors, and everything starts from scratch, then we, the later generations, will have to take many detours in the process from ignorance to knowledge, from knowing little to knowing a lot. Conversely, if we can inherit and learn from the experiences of our predecessors well, we can solve the contradiction between the limitedness of life and the infiniteness of scientific knowledge to a certain extent; we can master the experience accumulated by our predecessors in decades, hundreds, or even thousands of years in a relatively short period of time. On this basis, we can also continue to move forward more quickly.

    In addition to learning from predecessors, we must also learn from everyone, especially from advanced units and advanced individuals. A person's energy is limited, while the breadth of scientific knowledge is also infinite. This is another contradiction. The solution to this contradiction is to gather wisdom from all, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, make up for one's own weaknesses, take fewer detours, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. As the saying goes: "When three men walk together, there must be one who can teach me." With more people, there will be more ideas. Often, what you don't have here, others already have. Even if a unit is advanced, even if a person is very smart, there will be some shortcomings; conversely, some units and individuals, although backward, often have something unique in some aspects compared to others. If we can learn from each other, learn from others' strengths, and make up for our own weaknesses, the speed of technical innovation and technical revolution will be greatly accelerated, and the goal of mechanization and semi-mechanization can be achieved earlier. In the past, the electric saw of the Wood Products Factory of Dadong District, Shenyang City, used manual feeding, which was inefficient and wasted a lot of labor. They wanted to reform it a long time ago, but after more than half a year of research by three veteran workers, it was still not finally resolved. Recently, they went to various places to learn and found that others had already solved this problem, and the method was simple and easy to manufacture. After learning, they immediately changed manual feeding to automatic feeding, resulting in a 50% increase in production efficiency. The original degree of mechanization in the woodworking industry of Dadong District was only 10%. Due to the recent organized learning in various units, they learned twenty-five types of forty-four pieces of innovative machinery that they did not have in less than a week. After returning, they immediately integrated and promoted these advanced experiences and advanced technologies. The degree of mechanization in this industry can be increased to about 80% in the near future. Since mutual learning has so many benefits, why not do it?

    Of course, when learning from others, if you only know how to copy blindly, are unwilling to use your own brain, and cannot study and improve the learned experience, separating learning and creation, this is also wrong. This learning method can be called the ant method. Ants only know how to collect fruits everywhere and swallow them raw, without being able to manufacture what they collect. This is a lazy man's method. By adopting this method, you can only follow behind others and never surpass the advanced and strive for the upper reaches. On this point, we should learn from the bee, which can not only collect pollen from various places, but also process and manufacture what it collects, and improve it into honey. When the employees of the Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Factory were learning the advanced experience of "ants gnawing bones," they found that this experience mainly solved the problem of single-piece production, while their factory produced in batches. Therefore, they did not copy this experience verbatim, but absorbed the principles of "using small machines to do big work" and "using group ants to process large parts" according to the needs of their factory, combined with the performance of the factory's special equipment, and created a combined special equipment suitable for their own production characteristics. Therefore, in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, we must not only humbly learn from the advanced experience of others, but also "go a step further on the hundred-foot pole," use our brains and think of ways to continuously improve the technical level on the basis of new technology. Our attitude should be: be bold in humility, seek creation in learning, and combine humble learning with bold creation.

    学习和创造
    李剑云
    一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国范围内开展起来，互相学习和发明创造的事迹，有如风起云涌，百舸竞发。辽宁省大连工矿车辆厂铣工卢盛和“碰到谁，谁就是老师；走到那，那就是学校”，在1953年至1959年上半年的六年半中，革新技术一百二十五项，完成了十一年的工作量，接连获得十五次先进生产者称号。河北龙烟铁矿马万水小组八十个工人，一人掌握了新技术，大家都来学，既向本组学，还向外组、外地学，学先进赶先进，成为一种风气，所以十年来，创造先进经验二百多件，月月超额完成计划，一直是全国黑色金属矿山掘进的红旗。著名的劳动模范湖北省武汉重型机床厂调整工马学礼，能够做到“见先进就学”，去年一年中就提出三百多项革新建议。……这种虚心学习和大胆创造结合起来的共产主义美德，反映了在党和毛主席领导下成长起来的一代新人的精神面貌，这种精神越来越大地迸发出火花，它是我们伟大的跃进时代的风格。
    学习和创造是互相促进的。只有虚心好学，勤学好问，才能更多更好更巧地进行创造；任何重大的创造都离不开虚心的学习。最近，上海许多工人在日常生活中，从小孩荡秋千，小菜场秤蔬菜，糕团店做糕团，火柴盒上的图案，等等，得到启示，革新创造了很多东西。这充分说明了任何革新创造，无不利用前人、别人的劳动成果。如果一个人想脱离集体，完全靠自己单独搞革新创造，这是不可想像的事情。而且技术革新和技术革命也是无止境的，总是由小到大，由简到繁，由粗到精，由低级到高级不断地发展的。每一次发展就是一个创造，决不因为有人创造了，就到顶了，别人再也无法继续创造这方面的东西了。相反的，学习了别人的经验，从中得到启发，解决自己革新创造中的难关。同时，也能发现别人的创造不完善之处，而加以改进或新创，使原来的革新创造，不断提高，精益求精。大家都知道，果树需要和别的品种嫁接，才能使果子的品种越来越优良。一个人也需要不断学习和吸取别人的经验，才能使自己的经验越来越丰富、越先进、越完善，革新创造也就会越多、越好。因此，学习和创造不是互相排斥的，学习别人不但不会妨害自己的创造性，而且可以更加发挥自己的创造性。我国广大群众深深懂得这个道理，为了加速社会主义建设事业，个个干劲冲天，人人刻苦钻研，敢想敢说敢做，大胆试验和进行创造，同时又虚心学习别人的先进经验，使技术革新和技术革命运动日新月异地向前发展。但是有一些人对学习和创造两者的关系问题，还有一些错误认识。有的人存在着万事不求人的想法，他们好为人师，耻于学习别人，因而他们只是在那里闷头创造，从不去向别人学习。这是十分有害的。古人说：“敏而好学，不耻下问。”我们要想真正地搞一项重要的革新创造，做出一些成绩来，必须虚心地向别人学习。首先要向前辈老工人学习，孟子上有这样一句话：“公输子之巧，不以规矩，不能成方圆；师旷之聪，不以六律，不能正五音”。所谓“规矩”，就是前辈工匠在长期劳动实践中积累的经验总结；所谓“六律”也是前辈乐师，在长期音乐实践中积累的经验总结。人的一生是有限的，而科学知识的深度却是无限的，这是一个矛盾。如果我们不去继承和学习前人的这些经验总结，一切都是从头做起，那么我们后辈的人们，在从无知到有知，从知之不多到知之甚多的过程中，不知要走多少冤枉路。相反地，如果我们能够很好地继承和学习前人的经验，我们就可以在一定程度上解决人生有限和科学知识深度无限的这个矛盾；就可以在较短时间内，掌握前人几十年几百年以至几千年所积累起来的经验。在这个基础上，我们也就可以更加迅速地继续前进。
    除了向前人学习以外，还必须向一切人学习，特别是向先进单位和先进个人学习。一个人的精力是有限的，而科学知识领域的广度，也是无限的，这又是一个矛盾。解决这个矛盾的办法就是集思广益，互相学习，取长补短，少走弯路，事半功倍。俗语说：“三人同行，必有我师”。人多了，办法就会多起来，往往你这里没有的东西，别人那里却已经早有了。一个单位即便是先进的，一个人即便是非常聪明的，也会有某些不到之处；相反地，某些单位和个人，虽然是落后的，但是在某些方面，往往他也会比别人有独到之处。如果能够互相学习，取别人的长处，补足自己的短处，就会使技术革新和技术革命的速度大大加快，机械化和半机械化的目的，就可以更早的实现。沈阳市大东区木制品厂的电锯，过去用人推着上料，效率不高，浪费很多劳动力，他们很早以前，就想改革一下，但是经过三个老工人研究了半年多，仍然没有最后解决。最近他们到各地去学习，发现人家早已经把这个问题解决了，而且方法简单，制造容易。学习回来以后，他们马上把人工上料改为自动上料，结果提高生产效率50％。大东区木器行业原来的机械化程度只有10％，由于最近他们有组织地到各单位进行了学习，前后不到一个星期的时间就学习了二十五种四十四件自己所没有的革新机械，回来以后，他们立即把这些先进经验和先进技术加以综合推广，这个行业的机械化程度在近期内即可提高到80％左右。既然互相学习，有这样许多的好处，我们何乐而不为呢？
    当然在学习别人的时候，如果只知道死搬硬套，不愿自己动脑子，不能把学的经验加以研究和提高，把学习和创造分割开来，这也是不对的。这种学习方法，可以叫它是蚂蚁式的方法，蚂蚁只知道到处采集果实，生搬硬吞，不能把采集来的东西加以制造。这是一种懒汉方法，采取这种方法，就只有跟着人家的屁股后面转，永久不会超过先进，争得上游。在这一点上，我们要学习蜜蜂，它既能从各处采集花粉，又能把采集来的东西，进行加工制造，提高成蜂蜜。天津市锻压机床厂职工在学习“蚂蚁啃骨头”的先进经验的时候，发现这项经验主要是解决单件生产的办法，而本厂是成批生产，因此，没有原封不动地套用这项经验，而是根据本厂的需要吸取了其中用“小机器干大活”和用“群蚁加工大部件”的道理，结合本厂专用设备的性能，创造出适合自己生产特点的组合专用设备。因此，我们在技术革新和技术革命的运动中，既要虚心地学习别人的先进经验，又要“百尺竿头，更进一步”，在新的技术基础上，动脑筋，想办法，把技术水平不断提高。我们的态度应当是：虚心中有大胆，学习中求创造，把虚心学习和大胆创造结合起来。
