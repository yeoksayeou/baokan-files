    "Electric Pen" Embroidery
    The Jinjiang Arts and Crafts Factory in Fujian has created an "electric embroidery machine." The electric embroidery machine is as small and delicate as a pen. The embroidery girl holds this "pen" connected to electricity, and presses the switch installed on the "pen barrel." The "pen tip"—the embroidery needle threaded with thread—quickly "paints" along the lines on the white cloth. Immediately, red flowers and green leaves emerge on the embroidered cloth, revealing a beautiful and delicate pattern. Embroidering with the "electric pen" is both fast and good, increasing efficiency tenfold and saving 30 percent of embroidery thread.

    “电笔”绣花
    福建晋江美术工艺厂创造了“电动刺绣机”。电动刺绣机小巧玲珑得像支钢笔。绣花姑娘手里拿着这支通上电流的“钢笔”，按着装在“笔杆”上的开关，“笔尖”——穿上线的绣针，就沿着白布的线条飞快地在“描绘”。绣布上随即浮出朵朵的红花，片片的绿叶，显出了一幅美丽清秀的图案。用“电笔”绣花又快又好，提高工效十倍，节约绣线百分之三十。
