    Lenin Lives in Our Hearts
    --Introducing the Soviet Documentary "In Lenin's Lifetime"
    Sha Lang
    To commemorate the 90th anniversary of the birth of the great teacher of the proletarian revolution, Lenin, major cities across the country are screening the Soviet documentary "In Lenin's Lifetime" (Mandarin narration). This film is compiled from materials documenting Lenin's leadership of revolutionary struggles from 1918 to 1922. In the past, we have seen many brilliant images of Lenin created by artists. Today, we can truly see Lenin in the film, which makes us feel particularly close and inspired.
    The film opens with a scene of Moscow celebrating the May Day Labor Day in 1918. The crowds on Red Square are like an ocean, and Lenin is reviewing the Red Army troops. People around him constantly turn their heads to cast loving glances at the great leader. Lenin smiles, sometimes raising his arms, answering the cheers of the people.
    The scene then shifts to August 30, 1918. After Lenin's speech at the Basmanny workers' rally, he traveled by car to the Mikhail Factory (now named Vladimir Ilyich Factory) in the Zamoskvorechye district of Moscow. After Lenin spoke at a mass meeting there, he was shot and seriously wounded by the despicable enemies of the Soviet regime. The enemy's conspiracy did not succeed, and the people severely punished the public enemy—the assassin.
    The leader deeply loved by the working people of the world overcame his serious injuries with his unparalleled willpower and physical strength. Soon, we saw the recovered Lenin and his comrades walking in the courtyard of the Kremlin. Lenin spoke, pointing to the location of the two wounds on his shoulder.
    From the film, we also saw the scene of Lenin giving a speech in front of the Marx and Engels monument on the anniversary of the October Revolution. The film also recorded the invaluable moment in 1919, a year of storms, when the wise helmsman Lenin led and called on the workers, soldiers, and people of the whole country to unite closely around the Bolshevik Party, fiercely repel the enemy, and defend the achievements of the revolution. At the parade of the Workers' Corps held in May 1919, the great Lenin and representatives of the Hungarian Soviet Republic reviewed the team on Red Square. The soldiers expressed their determination to the leader to defend the young Soviet state and defend Lenin. Lenin held flowers in his right hand and constantly raised his left hand to his hat brim, echoing the masses.
    From the film, we also heard Lenin's kind voice, full of endless encouraging power: This is a recording of Lenin's speech to the troops in the autumn of 1919 before the Red Army set off from Moscow to strike the Denikin gang. He said that the Red Army is invincible, and the time for the complete defeat of the enemy is coming. Lenin's words were perfectly accurate, and soon the enemy was wiped out.
    From the film, we also saw Lenin's simple life. On this day, Lenin, his wife Krupskaya, and his sister were talking and laughing around the table at home. A cat was sitting quietly on Lenin's body, and Lenin's hand was stroking it. In the midst of the busy construction of the world's first socialist country, these were rare minutes in Lenin's life!

    列宁活在我们心中
    ——介绍苏联文献纪录片“在列宁生前”
    沙浪
    为纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁诞生九十周年，全国各大城市放映了苏联纪录片“在列宁生前”（华语解说）。这部影片剪辑了伟大的列宁在1918到1922年间领导革命斗争活动的资料。过去我们曾见过许多许多艺术家创造的列宁的光辉形象，今天我们从影片中可真的见到使我们感到分外亲切和受到鼓舞的列宁了。
    影片开始的镜头，是莫斯科在庆祝1918年的五一劳动节。红场上的人群像一片海洋，列宁在检阅红军队伍。周围的人们不断地回过头向伟大的领袖投出敬爱的眼光。列宁满面笑容，时而扬起手臂，回答人们的欢呼。
    镜头转到了1918年8月30日，列宁在巴斯曼工人大会演说以后，他乘汽车来到了莫斯科河外区的米海尔工厂（现名弗拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂），列宁在这里的群众大会上演讲以后，就受到苏维埃政权的卑鄙敌人的射击，列宁不幸中弹受了重伤。敌人阴谋并未得逞，人民严厉地惩治了人民公敌——暗杀者。
    世界劳动人民深切爱戴的领袖以他无比坚强的意志和身体，战胜了重伤。不久，我们又在克里姆林宫的广场上，看见恢复健康的列宁和他的战友散步在庭院里。列宁一面讲着话，一面用手指着肩上两处伤口的位置。
    从影片里，我们还看到了在十月革命一周年的日子里，列宁在马克思、恩格斯纪念碑前发表演说的情景。影片还亟其珍贵的纪录了1919年，那个暴风雨的年月，英明的舵手列宁，领导和号召工人、士兵和全国人民，紧密地团结在布尔什维克党的周围，猛烈地回击敌人，保卫革命成果。在1919年5月举行的工人兵团阅兵典礼上，伟大的列宁和匈牙利苏维埃共和国代表一起，在红场检阅着这支队伍，士兵们向领袖表示决心，保卫年青的苏维埃国家，保卫列宁。列宁右手把着鲜花，左手不断地伸到帽檐，和群众相呼应。
    从影片里，我们还听到了列宁亲切的、充满无限鼓舞力量的声音：这是1919年秋天，红军从莫斯科出发打击邓尼金匪帮前，列宁对部队的讲话录音。他说，红军是不可被战胜的，敌人完全失败的时候到临了。列宁的话一点也不差，不久敌人就被消灭了。
    从影片里我们还看见了列宁朴素的生活。这一天，列宁和他的夫人克鲁普斯卡娅及他的妹妹在家里围着桌子谈笑着，一支猫安坐在列宁的身上，列宁的手抚摸着它。在建设世界上第一个社会主义国家的百忙中，这是列宁生活中稀有的几分钟啊！
