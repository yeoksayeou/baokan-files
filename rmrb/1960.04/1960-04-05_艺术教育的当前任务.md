    The Current Tasks of Art Education

    Recently, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education convened a national art education work conference. It summarized the achievements and experiences of China's art education work since the founding of the country, especially since the implementation of the education revolution in 1958. It clarified the guiding principles for further developing art education in the future and formulated work plans. This conference has inspired the enthusiasm and confidence of art education workers and will play an important role in promoting the development of China's art education cause in the future.

    With the great leap forward in China's socialist economic construction, China's art education has also developed greatly. The number of existing higher and secondary art schools and the number of students enrolled have more than doubled compared with 1957. In the past two years, the art schools have implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining it with productive labor. A profound educational revolution has been and is being carried out. In art colleges, the Party's leadership over art education has been firmly established; an education system combining classroom teaching, productive labor, scientific research, and artistic practice, with teaching as the main focus, has been implemented. This has closely linked art education with productive labor, politics and art, and theory and practice. In the process of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, the thoughts, feelings, and lifestyles of the vast number of teachers and students have undergone profound changes, and their communist consciousness has been greatly enhanced. The mass line method of combining teachers and students has been adopted in teaching, breaking superstitions, liberating thought, developing scientific research and academic discussions, and improving teaching quality. In recent years, art colleges at all levels have trained many outstanding young art talents. This is a victory for the Party's education policy and literary and art policy, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction!

    With the all-round development and continuous leap forward of socialist construction in China, the extensive development and continuous deepening of the cultural revolution and the technological revolution require that the cause of culture and art must develop accordingly, and the need for literary and art cadres will also increase day by day. Therefore, further improving the quality of art education and developing the cause of art education has become an important and urgent task on the current cultural and educational front.

    To improve the quality of art education is to strengthen political and ideological education and professional education. However, judging from the current situation, strengthening political and ideological education is the most important issue. Since the anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological education work in art colleges has been strengthened, and the achievements are remarkable; but in order to meet the needs of socialist construction and to train more and better art talents who are both red and expert, this work still needs to be greatly strengthened.

    To strengthen political and ideological education, it is first necessary to strengthen Marxist-Leninist education. Artists of the new era must master Marxism-Leninism and establish a proletarian world outlook, otherwise they cannot become excellent proletarian artists, but can only become bourgeois artistic craftsmen. In studying Marxist-Leninist theory, it is also necessary to focus on studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and defended and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism under new historical conditions. Studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought can enable us to be invincible in all our work.

    For literary and art workers, in addition to studying the basic theories of Marxism, they also need to study Marxist literary and art thought. If literary and art workers do not have correct literary and art thought, then even if they politically approve of socialism, they may still be bourgeois in art. In the past, this aspect was particularly weak in art colleges. Many colleges did not establish Marxist literary and art theory courses, and bourgeois literary and art viewpoints still have a great influence. This situation must be changed. At present, a movement to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, including Comrade Mao Zedong's works on literature and art, should be launched among all teachers and students in art colleges. Political and ideological education and literary and art ideological education in Marxism-Leninism should be combined to educate young people to arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist literary and art thought. At the same time, this weapon should be used to continue to criticize various bourgeois literary and art thoughts, including modern revisionist literary and art thoughts, to thoroughly crush the shackles imposed on young students and completely eliminate their poison. Through this study and criticism, the Marxist literary and art thought courses in art colleges should be well established. Only in this way can we truly achieve political leadership in art colleges, and can we guarantee the training of art workers who are both red and expert.

    Marxist political and ideological education must also be implemented in the teaching of literary and artistic heritage. In art colleges, it is necessary to study the Chinese and foreign literary and artistic heritage, including the bourgeois literary and artistic heritage. However, a critical attitude should be adopted towards all heritage. Comrade Mao Zedong said that heritage should be divided into two parts, the essence and the dross. The essence should be absorbed, and the dross should be discarded. It should not be swallowed whole and absorbed uncritically. First of all, we must distinguish between which of the bourgeois literature and art is completely reactionary and decadent, and which defends the exploitative system, and which has played a progressive role in history. The former should be understood, but there is no question of learning and inheriting. The latter should be studied and absorbed critically. Those bourgeois literary and artistic works that have played a progressive role in history have left us with useful things, but those works are based on the bourgeois world outlook, and they all have varying degrees of individualism, pessimism, sentimentalism, anarchism, or "human nature theory" and other negative factors. These thoughts are fundamentally opposed to communist thought, and not only cannot cultivate young people with communist ideas and feelings, but also have a harmful impact on young people. Some people, due to the lack of scientific analysis and critical attitude towards the bourgeois literary and artistic heritage, have not only been affected by negative thoughts, but also restricted their artistic creation and innovation; some people even think that the artistic level reached by those works is insurmountable, and can only be imitated, and there can be no new creations; they can only worship and cannot criticize. This greatly hinders the development of proletarian socialist literature and art. In order to build its own socialist and communist civilization, the proletariat must inherit all the excellent achievements of human civilization, and at the same time must completely break with all traditional old ideas and old concepts; only through the analysis and criticism of tradition and heritage can there be true and rational inheritance. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "...We must never refuse to inherit and learn from the ancients and foreigners, even things of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. However, inheritance and learning must never become a substitute for one's own creation, which can never be replaced. In literature and art, uncritical hard copying and imitation of the ancients and foreigners is the most unpromising and the most harmful literary and artistic dogmatism." In art colleges, this "artistic dogmatism" still exists quite seriously. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all teachers and students to conduct scientific analysis and correct criticism of the bourgeois literary and artistic heritage from the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint while criticizing all bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts, so that all teachers and students can correctly treat the heritage and can use the dialectical materialism and historical materialism viewpoints to critically study and inherit the literary and artistic heritage of the past, so that it will be conducive to the innovation and creation of art.

    Another important aspect of strengthening political and ideological education is to continue to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and to continue to organize teachers and students to carry out labor training. Facts have proved that labor training is also completely suitable and completely necessary for teachers and students in art colleges. Art colleges must resolutely implement this policy, and at the same time pay attention to adopting methods suitable for the characteristics of art teaching to arrange labor training for teachers and students, so that it will surely receive great results. Literary and art workers participating in labor training and strengthening their ties with the masses also play a decisive role in solving the nationalization and popularization of literature and art.

    In addition to strengthening political and ideological education, improving the quality of education also requires strengthening professional education, diligently learning technology, and mastering knowledge. With skilled technology, one can well express life and express the thoughts and feelings of the people. With rich knowledge, one can better serve the cause of socialist construction.

    At present, the art education cause is far from meeting objective needs. To develop the art education cause in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to fully mobilize the positive factors in all aspects, and implement a whole set of two-legged walking policies that combine full-time and part-time education with spare-time education, combine long-term training with short-term training, and combine state-run schools with institution-run and enterprise-run schools; and strive to build a system of art education that is connected with higher, secondary, and primary art education, has multiple forms of schooling, and has basically complete professional settings in a relatively short period of time, according to needs and possibilities, in stages and in batches within the scope of cooperation zones and within the scope of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. In the next few years, we should vigorously strengthen weak links, add missing majors, consolidate and improve existing colleges, and conscientiously run a number of key colleges to make them important bases for developing and improving China's art education; at the same time, we should focus on developing higher art education, build more secondary art schools, and especially vigorously promote professional art groups and enterprise-run schools, and greatly develop amateur or after-school art education.

    To improve the quality of art education, develop the cause of art education, and run art schools well, the key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, and the principle of putting politics in command must be implemented in professional work. Art colleges must accept the leadership of the local Party committee, and the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee must be implemented. The Party's leadership mainly focuses on grasping political and ideological work and grasping the quality of education. Art education workers must, under the leadership of the Party, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, strive to familiarize themselves with their work, closely contact the masses, and unite with experts, so that they will surely be able to run art education well, and will surely be able to shoulder the great tasks entrusted by the Party and the people, and cultivate a batch of art talents who are both red and expert for the motherland.

    艺术教育的当前任务
    最近，文化部和教育部召开了全国艺术教育工作会议，总结了建国以来，特别是1958年实行教育革命以来，我国艺术教育工作的成绩和经验，明确了今后进一步发展艺术教育的方针，制定了工作规划。这次会议鼓舞了艺术教育工作者的干劲和信心，对今后我国艺术教育事业的发展将起重要的推动作用。
    随着我国社会主义经济建设事业的大跃进，我国的艺术教育事业也有了很大的发展。现有的高等、中等艺术学校和在校学生人数都比1957年增加一倍以上。两年来，艺术学校贯彻执行了党关于教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，深刻的教育革命已经进行并且正在进行着。在艺术院校里，已经巩固地树立起党对艺术教育的领导；实行了以教学为主的课堂教学、生产劳动、科学研究、艺术实践四结合的教育制度，使艺术教育和生产劳动、政治和艺术、理论和实际密切地结合起来；广大师生在和工农兵群众相结合的过程中，思想感情和生活方式都发生了深刻的变化，共产主义觉悟大大提高；在教学中采取了师生结合的群众路线的方法，破除迷信，解放思想，发展了科学研究和学术讨论，提高了教学质量。几年来，各级各类的艺术院校造就了许多优秀的青年艺术人材。这是党的教育方针和文艺方针的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    随着我国社会主义建设的全面发展和持续跃进，文化革命、技术革命的广泛开展和不断深入，要求文化艺术事业必须相应地发展，从而对文艺干部的需要也将日益增长。因此，进一步提高艺术教育质量，发展艺术教育事业，已经成为当前文化教育战线上的一项重要的迫切的任务。
    提高艺术教育的质量就是要加强政治思想教育和专业教育。但从当前情况来看，加强政治思想教育是最重要的问题。自从反右派斗争以后，艺术院校的政治思想教育工作已经加强，成绩是显著的；但是为了适应社会主义建设的需要，为了培养更多更好的又红又专的艺术人材，这一工作还需要大大加强。
    加强政治思想教育，首先要加强马克思列宁主义教育。新时代的艺术家必须掌握马克思列宁主义，树立无产阶级的世界观，否则就不可能成为优秀的无产阶级艺术家，只能成为资产阶级的艺术匠人。在学习马克思列宁主义理论中，又必须着重学习毛泽东同志的著作。毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合，在新的历史条件下保卫了和创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。学习和掌握毛泽东思想，就可以使我们在一切工作上无往不胜。
    对文艺工作者说来，除了学习马克思主义基本理论，还需要学习马克思主义的文艺思想。文艺工作者没有正确的文艺思想，那末尽管在政治上赞成社会主义，在艺术上仍然可能是资产阶级的。在艺术院校中，过去这一方面特别薄弱，许多院校都没有建立起马克思主义的文艺理论课程，资产阶级的文艺观点还有很大的影响。这种状况必须改变。目前在艺术院校的全体师生中，应该开展一个学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志著作，包括毛泽东同志有关文艺的著作的运动。应该把马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育和文艺思想教育结合起来，教育青年用马克思列宁主义的文艺思想来武装自己，同时要运用这个武器，继续批判各种各色的资产阶级文艺思想，包括现代修正主义的文艺思想，彻底粉碎它们加于青年学生的束缚和枷锁，彻底清除它们的毒害。通过这种学习和批判，进一步把艺术院校的马克思主义的文艺思想课程好好建立起来。只有这样，才能在艺术院校里真正做到政治挂帅，才能保证培养出又红又专的艺术工作者。
    马克思主义的政治思想教育还必须贯彻到对文艺遗产的教学中去。在艺术院校中，必须学习中国的和外国的文学艺术遗产，包括资产阶级的文艺遗产。但是对于一切遗产，都应该采取批判的态度去学习。毛泽东同志说，对遗产应该把它们分解为精华和糟粕两部分，要吸取精华，抛弃糟粕，不能生吞活剥，无批判地吸收。我们首先要区别资产阶级文艺中，有哪些是完全反动的、腐朽的，为剥削制度辩护的，有哪些是在历史上起过进步作用的。对前一种，虽然也要去了解它们，但并不存在学习和继承的问题。对后一种，就要批判地学习吸收。在历史上起过进步作用的那些资产阶级文艺作品，给我们留下了有用的东西，但是那些作品是以资产阶级的世界观为基础的，它们都带有不同程度的个人主义、悲观主义、感伤主义、无政府主义或“人性论”等等消极因素。这些思想同共产主义思想是根本对立的，不仅不能培养青年具有共产主义思想和感情，而且还会对青年产生有害的影响。有些人由于对资产阶级文艺遗产缺乏科学分析和批判的态度，不但受到消极的思想影响，而且束缚了他们在艺术上的创造和革新；有些人甚至认为那些作品所达到的艺术水平是不可超越的，只能摹仿，不可能有新的创造；只能拜倒，不能批判。这就大大阻碍了无产阶级社会主义文学艺术的发展。无产阶级为了建设自己的社会主义、共产主义的文化，必须继承人类文化的一切优秀成果，同时又必须同一切传统的旧思想、旧观点彻底决裂；只有经过对传统和遗产的分析和批判，才能有真正的合理的继承。毛泽东同志说：“……我们决不可拒绝继承和借鉴古人和外国人，那怕是封建阶级和资产阶级的东西。但是继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”在艺术院校中，这种“艺术教条主义”还是相当严重地存在着。因此，必须发动全体师生，在批判一切资产阶级文艺思想的同时，还要用马克思列宁主义的观点对资产阶级的文艺遗产进行科学的分析和正确的批判，使全体师生能够正确地对待遗产，能够用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点批判地学习和继承过去的文学艺术遗产，这样才有利于艺术的革新和创造。
    加强政治思想教育的另一个重要方面就是继续贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，继续组织师生进行劳动锻炼。事实证明，劳动锻炼对于艺术院校的师生也是完全适合、完全必要的。艺术院校必须坚决执行这一方针，同时注意采取适合于艺术教学特点的方法来安排师生的劳动锻炼，这样就一定会收到巨大的效果。文学艺术工作者参加劳动锻炼，加强和群众的联系，对于解决文学艺术的民族化、群众化问题也有决定性的作用。
    提高教育质量除了加强政治思想教育以外，还必须加强专业教育，认真学习技术，掌握知识。有了熟练的技术，才能很好地表现生活，表达人民的思想感情。有了丰富的知识，才能更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    目前艺术教育事业远不能满足客观的需要。要多快好省地发展艺术教育事业，必须充分调动各方面的积极因素，实行全日制和半日制教育同业余教育并举、长期培养与短期训练并举、国家办学同事业单位和企业单位办学并举的一整套的两条腿走路的方针；并且争取在一个较短的时期里，根据需要和可能，在协作区范围内，在各省、市、自治区范围内分期分批地建成高等、中等、初等艺术教育相互衔接的、多种办学形式并举的、专业设置基本齐全的艺术教育体系。在今后几年内，应该大力加强薄弱环节，补设缺门专业，巩固、提高现有院校，切实办好一批重点院校，使它们成为发展和提高我国艺术教育的重要基地；同时，应该有重点地发展高等艺术教育，较多地建设一批中等艺术学校，特别是要大力提倡专业艺术团体和企业单位办学，并大量发展业余或者课余艺术教育。
    要提高艺术教育质量，发展艺术教育事业，办好艺术学校，关键在于加强党的领导，必须将政治挂帅的原则贯彻到业务中去。艺术院校一定要接受当地党委的领导，要贯彻党委领导下的校务委员会负责制。党的领导主要是抓政治思想工作，抓教育质量。艺术教育工作者必须在党的领导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，努力熟悉业务，紧密地联系群众，团结专家，这样就一定能把艺术教育办好，一定能担负起党和人民交付的伟大的任务，为祖国培养出一批又一批又红又专的艺术人材。
