Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Geneva dispatch from TASS: The press officer of the Soviet delegation to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting issued the following statement to the press today:

"According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press, U.S. Secretary of State Herter stated at a press conference on April 8th that the Soviet Union wanted the Geneva disarmament talks to recess until the summit meeting in Paris in May, and he described this as some kind of Soviet tactic. The Associated Press then quoted Herter as saying that Western countries opposed such a long recess period from the end of April to mid-June, and agreed to a shorter recess period." This news is surprising because, in fact, the Soviet side did not raise the issue of interrupting the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting because of the upcoming summit meeting. The question of recess and resumption (from April 29th to June 7th) was informally agreed upon by both parties.

"This can be confirmed by the statement made by U.S. representative to the Ten-Nation Committee, Eaton, on April 9th, who said: 'The issue of this recess was discussed between the two sides, and an agreement was reached with each other. Any statement that this was the result of the Soviet Union's insistence can only be due to misunderstanding.'"

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: TASS commentator Orlov commented on the East-West disarmament talks, saying that the public in many countries justly believes that the new proposals put forward by the socialist countries' delegation at the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference are a serious attempt to find a way out of the difficulties that have arisen during the Disarmament Committee's work for nearly a month. The socialist countries' delegation's proposals attempt to find a common basis acceptable to all participants in the negotiations for carrying out the work of achieving comprehensive and complete disarmament.

Orlov wrote that the draft "Basic Principles of Comprehensive and Complete Disarmament" proposed by the Soviet delegation on behalf of the socialist countries' delegation was put forward based on the desire to help solve this task. However, as soon as the new proposals of the socialist countries were put forward, some Western newspapers rushed to slander the proposal, making people doubt its practical value and rationality.

The "New York Times," in an article on April 9th entitled "New Deadlock in Geneva," tried its best to shirk the responsibility for the difficulties arising in the Geneva disarmament talks, saying that it was the Soviet Union, not the Western countries, that complicated the Geneva talks. This approach by the "New York Times" is particularly clumsy. Just a few days ago, the "New York Times" correspondent in Geneva, Rosenthal, wrote: "The U.S. delegation has abandoned the diplomatic etiquette it has observed for three weeks, both in and out of the meeting, and has become stubborn - deliberately and severely stubborn."

Orlov pointed out that this deliberate stubborn attitude does not help to reach agreements on major international issues. The "New York Times'" attempt to insist that the Soviet Union wants to delay the meeting is completely futile.

Orlov concluded by saying that any fair observer knows that the new proposals of the socialist countries are precisely to bring the views and positions of the members of the Disarmament Committee closer together, to advance their work, and to accelerate this work. Perhaps this does not suit the taste of certain people in the West. However, it is these people who should be blamed.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Geneva dispatch from TASS: Eaton, the head of the U.S. delegation to the East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, issued a statement to the press on April 9th regarding certain news about the recess of the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference.

Eaton's statement said: The delegations of the Soviet Union and Western countries informally exchanged views on the issue of a recess of about six weeks from the end of April to June. The two sides discussed the issue of such a recess, and an agreement was reached with each other. Eaton said that any statement that this was the result of the Soviet Union's firm insistence on a recess can only be due to misunderstanding.

    苏联代表团发表声明斥责赫脱造谣
    裁军会议休会是双方商定的
    塔斯社揭露西方国家顽固阻挠谈判进展
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：参加十国裁军委员会会议的苏联代表团的新闻官今天向报界发表了如下声明：
    “据美联社华盛顿消息，美国国务卿赫脱在4月8日的记者招待会上说，苏联想使日内瓦裁军谈判休会到5月在巴黎召开的最高级会议结束为止，他还把这说成是苏联方面的某种手腕。美联社接着援引赫脱的话说，西方国家反对从4月底到6月中这样长的休会期，而同意较短的休会期。“这个消息使人感到惊奇，因为事实上苏联方面根本没有因即将举行的最高级会议而提出中断十国裁军委员会会议的问题。关于休会和复会（由4月29日到6月7日）的问题是双方非正式商定的。
    “参加十国委员会的美国代表伊顿4月9日的声明可以证实这一点，他说：‘关于这次休会的问题曾经过双方讨论，并且已经彼此同意，达成了协议。认为这是苏联方面坚决主张的结果的任何说法都只能是出于误解’。”
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫就东西方裁军谈判发表评论说，许多国家的公众公正地认为，社会主义国家代表团在日内瓦十国裁军会议上提出的新建议，是从裁军委员会将近一个月的工作过程中所产生的困难中寻找出路的认真尝试。社会主义国家代表团的建议试图找寻为谈判的全体参加者都能接受的、为了实现全面彻底裁军而进行工作的共同基础。
    奥尔洛夫写道，苏联代表社会主义国家代表团提出的关于“全面彻底裁军基本原则”的草案，是根据有助于解决这项任务的愿望而提出的。但是，社会主义国家的新建议刚一提出，某些西方报纸就连忙毁谤这个建议，使人们怀疑它的实际价值和合理性。
    “纽约时报”在4月9日的一篇题为“日内瓦的新僵局”的文章中，竭力推卸对日内瓦裁军谈判产生的困难的责任，说什么使日内瓦谈判复杂化的，是苏联而不是西方国家。“纽约时报”的这种手法是特别拙劣的。就在几天之前，“纽约时报”驻日内瓦记者罗森塔尔写道：“美国代表团在会上和会下都抛弃了它三周来所遵守的外交礼节，而变得顽固起来——故意地和严厉地顽固起来。”
    奥尔洛夫就此指出，这种有意顽固的态度无助于就重大国际问题达成协议。“纽约时报”企图硬说苏联希望拖延会议，这完全是枉费心机。
    奥尔洛夫最后说，任何一个公正的观察家都清楚，社会主义国家的新建议正是为了使裁军委员会各成员国的观点和立场接近起来，推进他们的工作，加速这个工作。也许，这不符合西方某些人士的口胃。但是，正是这些人应该受到指责。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：参加东西方十国裁军委员会会议的美国代表团团长伊顿9日就关于日内瓦十国裁军会议休会的某些消息向报界发表声明。
    伊顿的声明说：关于从4月底到6月间休会约六个星期的问题，苏联和西方各国代表团之间曾非正式地交换了意见。双方讨论对这样的休会问题，并且已经彼此同意，达成了协议。伊顿说，认为这是由于苏联方面坚决主张休会的结果的任何说法，都只能是出于误解。
