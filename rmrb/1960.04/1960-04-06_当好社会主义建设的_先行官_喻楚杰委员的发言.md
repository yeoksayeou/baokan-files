Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC at the Second Session of the Third CPPCC National Committee. Now, I will mainly talk about the situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement carried out by the railway department.

Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Especially since 1958, the people of the whole country have adhered to the Party's general line for socialist construction, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, adhered to the people's communes, carried out a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, continuously opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted morale, and achieved unprecedented and comprehensive leaps forward in all aspects of industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, and science, completing the main targets of the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy three years ahead of schedule. Like other undertakings in our country, the railway transportation industry has achieved unprecedented leaps forward with the overall leap forward of the national economy. In 1958, railway freight volume increased by 39% compared with 1957, and in 1959, it increased by 42% compared with 1958. The total freight volume in these two years was equivalent to 86.7% of the total freight volume in the five years of the first five-year plan; the basic construction investment completed in these two years was equivalent to 94% of the total amount in the five years of the first five-year plan; the newly added locomotives and vehicles in these two years were equivalent to 339% and 88% of the total amount in the five years of the first five-year plan. This scale of construction and speed of growth is unprecedented in the history of Chinese railways.

Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Blossom Everywhere on National Railways

Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line, in order to be a good "pioneer" and resolutely meet the needs of the rapid development of the national economy for railway transportation, railway workers across the country have continuously broken superstitions, carried forward the communist style of daring to think and act, fully tapped potential capabilities in all aspects, strengthened collaboration, and carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, achieving brilliant achievements in recent years. Taking the comprehensive indicator of vehicle turnaround time as an example, due to improved efficiency in loading and unloading, marshalling, and operation, it was shortened by 0.09 days in 1958 compared with 1957, equivalent to saving more than 2,400 operating vehicles per day, and shortened by 0.28 days in 1959 compared with 1958, saving more than 10,000 operating vehicles per day.

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership and call of the Party, the national railways have fully launched a massive mass movement, with large-scale technical innovation and large-scale technical revolution blossoming everywhere. This movement has a strong momentum, rapid development, wide scope, and significant results. In a very short period of time, the movement has spread to all departments and units of the railway. Not only have the production departments and major production workers actively participated in the movement, but also the production auxiliary departments, management departments, and service departments have rapidly and universally joined this movement. Everywhere, large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, track maintenance, construction, and locomotive and vehicle manufacturing are being carried out, machines and equipment are being transformed, "one-dragon" transportation is being organized, and advances are being made towards high, large, sophisticated, advanced, and new goals. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought of continuous revolution, the broad masses of workers have a strong desire for this movement. They deeply understand that only by continuously innovating technology can they be liberated from heavy physical labor, fundamentally improve working conditions, and greatly increase labor productivity. The workers are determined to: "Sweep away manual operations, transform all old machine tools, mechanize loading and unloading and track maintenance, eliminate carrying by back and shoulder, carpenters discard axes, planes, and saws, ironworkers put down hammers and tongs, coal loading no longer uses large iron shovels, and production is fully automated." Now, a great situation of "unity of the people, galloping horses, a riot of color, and a completely new look" has emerged on the national railways.

"One-Dragon" Transportation and Large-Scale Collaboration is a Major Revolution in Current Railway Transportation Organization

The "one-dragon" transportation and large-scale collaboration carried out in railway transportation work is a major revolution in the current railway transportation organization. It closely connects all transportation links of material production, transportation, and sales, including factories and mines, stations, ports, trains, ships, urban handling, consignees and consignors, and various internal units of the railway, coordinating actions to form a rapid transportation line that is connected in a straight line, tightly linked in a chain, and continuous throughout the water and land全程. This greatly speeds up the transportation of materials and also accelerates the turnaround of vehicles and ships. Taking Qinhuangdao Port Station, which first implemented "one-dragon" transportation, as an example, in the first half of 1959, due to the implementation of "one-dragon" transportation, the port throughput increased 1.8 times compared with the same period in 1958 under the condition that the equipment capacity basically did not increase, and the railway loading and unloading of vehicles increased by nearly one time.

"One-dragon" transportation is the product of communist large-scale collaboration between Chinese railway workers and workers of fraternal departments. Now, the entire railway is developing towards "dragon-netting." In February of this year, the national railways organized a total of 15,226 "dragon trains," a sudden increase of 73% compared with January. Therefore, with the increase of 2,148 vehicles loaded per day in February compared with January, the vehicle turnaround time decreased by 0.06 days compared with January, equivalent to saving 2,532 operating vehicles per day. At present, road-factory and road-mine cooperation has developed from seven unifications and twelve unifications in dispatching, commanding, and organization work to the overall transformation of road-factory and road-mine station yards. For example, after the overall transformation of the station yard of Xifuxin Road and Mine, the operating capacity can be doubled, and after the transformation of the station yard of Hegang Coal Mine, the vehicle dwell time can be cut in half, and more than 20 kilometers of steel rails can be freed up, saving ten locomotives.

"In the past, loading and unloading was slow and tiring. Now, you press a button, and a car is finished in the blink of an eye."

At present, the national railway's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with "one-dragon" transportation as the key, is advancing towards the four modernizations, two lines, and high, large, sophisticated, advanced, and new goals. The four modernizations refer to mechanization, automation, internal combustion, and electrification; the two lines are production automation lines and production linkage lines. After only a few months, in most production units, manual operations and heavy physical labor have been transformed into mechanization and semi-mechanization. According to the statistics of the four railway bureaus of Harbin, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Beijing alone, in the past two months, the masses have put forward 770,000 innovation proposals, adopted 210,000 of them, and put 70,000 into production, which is expected to save 70,000 laborers throughout the year. Among them, the workers of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau put forward 150,000 innovation proposals in 20 days, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading in the whole bureau increased sharply from the original 33% to more than 60%; the Harbin Railway Bureau realized 100 production automation lines and linkage lines, 76 single-machine automation and linkage, and 431 mechanization and semi-mechanization projects in ten days; Under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tianjin Railway Office fought hard for dozens of days, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading rapidly increased from 40% to 60% at the beginning of the year to 80% to 95%, labor productivity increased by 30%, and more than 1,200 laborers were saved; Guang'anmen Station in Beijing used a total of 20 days to increase the degree of loading and unloading mechanization from 21.3% to 80%, and the number of loading and unloading workers was reduced from 720 to 480. The mechanization of loading and unloading not only greatly improved the efficiency of loading and unloading and avoided the phenomenon of vehicles "running in the middle and nesting at both ends" in the past, but also greatly reduced the heavy physical labor of the workers. The workers praised mechanization and said: "In the past, loading and unloading was slow and tiring. Now, you press a button, and a car is finished in the blink of an eye. The machine unloads the car, and everyone smiles." This fully reflects the joy of the workers after getting rid of heavy physical labor.

Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution, One Victory After Another

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the policy of walking on two legs, combining foreign and indigenous methods, using foreign methods when possible, using indigenous methods when foreign methods are not possible, moving from indigenous to foreign, self-reliance, making the most of crude conditions, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials, and advocating methods that cost less money, are easy to build, and have great benefits were resolutely implemented. For example, in order to facilitate loading and unloading and increase loading and unloading speed, railway workers created high platforms and low cargo positions, which increased efficiency by one to twenty times or more. Based on this principle, many factories and mines have also developed into sliding-slope coal storage bins, which not only greatly increase the speed of loading, but also play a role in storing coal, achieving "production continues even if there are no trains for three days, and loading continues even if there is no production for three days," realizing uninterrupted production and transportation, and playing a great role. For example, during the Great Leap Forward, in order to solve the rapidly growing vehicle marshalling operations, the workers created "indigenous humps" in many marshalling stations, which increased marshalling capacity by 60% to 100%. This is also a creation that costs less money, is easy to build, and has great benefits. This year, this kind of indigenous hump has been gradually modernized. Under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of more than 40 units inside and outside the railway, the workers of Fengtai Station worked hard for 17 days to modernize the indigenous hump and complete the mechanization and automation device, which increased the efficiency of the station's shunting by more than 50% and labor productivity by more than 70%.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a production revolution movement and also an ideological revolution movement. On the one hand, it is transforming nature, and on the other hand, it is transforming people's thinking. In the movement, Party committees at all levels have further strengthened ideological leadership, adhered to putting politics in command, advocated the spirit of daring to boldly conceive, boldly practice, and not fearing heaven or earth; advocated the "poor stick" spirit of self-reliance, learning from others when there is no experience, building our own equipment when there is no equipment, and creating our own conditions when there are no conditions, and small factories doing big things "chicken coops producing phoenixes"; advocated the socialist labor competition of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward"; advocated the noble communist style of rushing to difficulties, giving way to honors, not counting remuneration for labor, and not talking about conditions for work. At the same time, with the spirit of continuous revolution, new goals of struggle are constantly put forward to the masses, morale is constantly boosted, climaxes are constantly created, superstitions are constantly broken, and minds are constantly liberated, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement can achieve one victory after another.

The reason why the national railway's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has achieved great victories once again proves the Party's wise leadership. It is the victory of the Party's general line, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, this movement has entered a new stage and continues to develop in depth, which is of great significance for further improving China's railway technology level and developing social productivity. This is an important material foundation for the sustained leap forward of China's national economy, and it is also an important guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the 1960 national economic plan. I believe that as long as we are under the leadership of our glorious and great Party, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, continue to carry forward the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements in a big way, extensively carry out socialist competitions, constantly promote advanced experience, and match single advanced experience into a dragon, constantly develop, and constantly improve, our technical innovation and technical revolution movement will surely advance by leaps and bounds with the momentum of overwhelming mountains and seas, and climb to the advanced peaks of the world in a not too long time. A powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture will stand like a giant in the East of the world in a not too long time.

    当好社会主义建设的“先行官”
    喻楚杰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理在人大第二届第二次会议上关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，陈叔通副主席在政协第三届第二次会议上所做的关于政协常务委员会的工作报告。现在，我主要讲讲铁路部门开展技术革新和技术革命运动情况。
    建国十年多来，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，取得了辉煌的成就。特别是1958年以来，全国人民坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性的增产节约运动，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，在工业、农业、交通运输、文化科学等各方面出现了史无前例的、全面的大跃进，提前三年完成了我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的主要指标。我国铁路运输事业和其他事业一样，随着国民经济的全面跃进，取得了空前的跃进。1958年铁路货运量比1957年增长了39％，而1959年又比1958年增长42％，两年运量的总和相当于第一个五年计划五年总运量的86.7％；两年完成的基本建设投资相当于第一个五年计划五年总和的94％；两年新增的机车、车辆相当于第一个五年计划五年总数的339％和88％。这种建设的规模和增长的速度，在中国铁路史上是前所未有的。
    全国铁路技术革新和技术革命遍地开花
    全国铁路职工在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，为了当好“先行”，坚决完成国民经济的飞跃发展对铁路运输的需要。几年来，不断破除迷信，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在各方面充分挖掘潜在能力，加强协作，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，取得了辉煌的成就。以车辆周转时间这个综合指标为例，由于提高了装卸、编组、运行的效率，1958年比1957年缩短了零点零九天，相当于每天节省运用车二千四百多辆，1959年又比1958年缩短零点二八天，每天节省运用车一万多辆。
    今年以来，在党的领导和号召下，全国铁路已经全面开展了一个声势浩大的群众运动，大闹技术革新和大闹技术革命遍地开花。这次运动来势猛、发展快、范围广、收效大，在极短时间内，运动遍及铁路各个部门、各个单位，不仅生产部门和主要生产工人积极投入运动，而且生产辅助部门、管理部门和服务部门的职工也迅速地普遍地投入了这个运动。到处都在大搞装卸、养路、施工和机车车辆制造机械化、半机械化，改造机器设备，组织“一条龙”运输以及向高、大、精、尖、新进军。广大职工在毛泽东不断革命的思想指引下，对这次运动怀着强烈的愿望，他们深深体会到，只有不断革新技术，才能从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，根本改善劳动条件，大大提高劳动生产率。工人们决心要把：“手工操作一扫光，全部改造旧机床，装卸养路机械化，运搬消灭背抬扛，木工扔掉斧刨锯，铁工放下锤与钳，上煤不用大铁铲，生产全部自动线”。现在，全国铁路已经出现了“万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”的大好局面。
    “一条龙”运输大协作是当前铁路运输组织工作的大革命
    在铁路运输工作中开展的“一条龙”运输大协作，是当前铁路运输组织工作的大革命。它把物资的产、运、销的各个运输环节，包括厂矿、车站、港口、火车、船舶、城市搬运、收发货单位，以及铁路内部各单位紧紧地连成一体，协调动作，形成一条一线相连、环环扣紧，水陆全程连续不断地快速运输线。这样就大大地加速了物资的运输，也加快了车辆和船舶的周转。以首先实行“一条龙”运输的秦皇岛港站为例，1959年上半年由于推行了“一条龙”运输，在设备能力基本没有增加的条件下，港口吞吐量比1958年同期增长一点八倍，铁路装卸车增长将近一倍。
    “一条龙”运输是我国铁路职工和兄弟部门职工共产主义大协作的产物，现在全路正在向“龙网化”发展，今年2月份全国铁路共组织了一万五千二百二十六条“龙车”，比1月份突增73％。因而在2月份装车比1月份每日增加了二千一百四十八车的情况下，车辆周转时间比1月份反而减少了零点零六天，相当于每天节约运用车二千五百三十二辆。目前路厂、路矿协作，已经从调度、指挥、组织工作等七统一、十二统一等发展到路厂、路矿站场的总体改造。如西阜新路矿的站场经过总体改造以后，作业能力可以提高一倍，鹤岗煤矿的站场改造以后，车辆停留时间可以砍掉一半，并能腾出钢轨二十多公里，节省机车十台。
    过去装卸慢，累得一身汗  现在按电钮，转眼一车完
    目前全国铁路的技术革新和技术革命运动，以“一条龙”运输为纲，正向四化、两线和高、大、精、尖、新进军。四化是指机械化、自动化、内燃化、电气化；两线是生产自动线和生产联动线。经过短短几个月的时间，在大部分生产单位中，实现了变手工操作和笨重体力劳动为机械化、半机械化。仅据哈尔滨、沈阳、锦州、北京四个铁路局的统计，两个月来，群众提出了革新倡议达七十七万件，采纳了二十一万件，投入生产的有七万件，预计全年即可节省劳动力七万人。其中锦州铁路局职工在二十天内就提出革新建议十五万件，全局装卸机械化、半机械化程度即由原来的33％，猛增到60％以上；哈尔滨铁路局在十天中，就实现了生产自动线和联动线一百条，单机自动化和联动化七十六项，机械化、半机械化四百三十一项；天津铁路办事处在中共天津市委领导下，奋战几十天，装卸机械化、半机械化程度由年初的40％至60％，迅速提高到80％至95％，劳动生产率提高30％，节省劳动力一千二百余人；北京市广安门车站共用二十天就使装卸机械化程度由21.3％提高到80％，装卸工人从七百二十人减少到四百八十人。装卸机械化不但大大提高了装卸效率，避免了过去车辆“跑在中间，窝在两头”的现象，而且大大减轻了工人的繁重的体力劳动。工人歌颂机械化说：“过去装卸慢，累得一身汗，现在按电钮，转眼一车完，机器把车卸，人人笑开颜。”充分反映了工人同志摆脱笨重体力劳动以后的喜悦心情。
    技术革新和技术革命一个胜利接着一个胜利
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，坚决贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，洋土结合，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，由土到洋，自力更生，因陋就简，因地制宜，就地取材，提倡花钱少、建设易、收效大的办法。如为了便于装卸，提高装卸速度，铁路职工创造了高站台、低货位，提高效率一到二十倍以上。很多厂矿根据这个原理，还发展为滑坡式储煤仓，不仅装车速度提高很多，而且还起了储存煤的作用，做到了“三天不来车一样生产，三天不生产一样装车”，实现不间断地生产和运输，起了很大作用。又如，在大跃进中，很多编组站为了解决迅速增长的车辆编组作业，职工们创造了“土驼峰”，使编组能力提高60％到一倍以上。这也是一种花钱少、建设易、收效大的创造。今年这种土驼峰已经逐步洋化。丰台车站职工在党的领导下，在路内外四十多个单位的大力支持下，大干十七天，使土驼峰洋化，完成了机械化、自动化装置，使车站调车效率提高50％以上，劳动生产率提高70％以上。
    技术革新和技术革命运动是一个生产革命运动，也是一个思想革命运动。一方面是改造自然，一方面是改造人们的思想。在运动中，各级党委都进一步加强了思想领导，坚持政治挂帅，提倡敢于大胆设想，大胆实践，天不怕、地不怕的劲头；提倡自力更生的“穷棒子”精神，没有经验向人学，没有设备自己造，没有条件自己创，小厂办大事“鸡窝出凤凰”；提倡“学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛；提倡见困难就上、见荣誉就让，劳动不计报酬、工作不讲条件的崇高的共产主义风格。同时，以不断革命的精神，不断向群众提出新的奋斗目标，不断鼓干劲、搞高潮，不断地破除迷信、解放思想，使技术革新和技术革命的运动，一个胜利接着一个胜利。
    全国铁路技术革新和技术革命运动所以取得巨大胜利，再一次证明了党的英明领导，它是党的总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。现在这一运动已经进入一新的阶段，继续向纵深发展，对进一步提高我国铁路技术水平、发展社会生产率具有重要意义。这是我国国民经济持续跃进的重要物质基础，也是完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划的重要保证。我相信，只要在我们光荣伟大的党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚决贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，以及一整套两条腿走路的方针，继续发扬共产主义大协作的精神，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，广泛开展社会主义竞赛，不断推广先进经验，并把单项的先进经验配套成龙，不断发展、不断提高，我们的技术革新和技术革命运动必将以排山倒海之势，一日千里地飞跃前进，在不太长的时间内攀登世界的先进高峰。一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家，将在不太长的时间内，在世界的东方像巨人样站立起来。
