Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a report by the Mongolian News Agency: In recent months, the laboring people on all production fronts in Mongolia have been enthusiastically carrying out a patriotic movement to strive for the early completion of the Three-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. The specific goal of this movement is to complete the tasks of 1960—the last year of the Three-Year Plan—ahead of schedule.

Currently, the laboring people in more than ten provinces, including East Gobi, Dzavhan, Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, Choibalsan, Khuvsgul, Uvs, Arkhangai, Dundgovi, and Bayankhongor, are enthusiastically involved in this socialist competition movement.

The people of each province participating in the movement have put forward their own specific guarantees. For example, the laboring people of Bayan-Ulgii province guarantee to over fulfill the 1960 livestock breeding plan and over fulfill the production plan for various crops by 10%. Khovd province will expand its sown area this year by 30% compared to last year, and its output will increase by 5.9%. The handicraft cooperatives are expected to complete the three-year plan three months ahead of schedule. The laboring people of Choibalsan province guarantee to over fulfill the already formulated livestock production plan to increase the number of livestock by 3.7%, of which the number of publicly raised livestock in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives will increase by 6.7%. Agricultural laborers in Uvs province guarantee to reclaim 6,000 hectares of land, bringing the sown area to 13,775 hectares. The laboring people of East Gobi province guarantee to over fulfill the plan to increase 836,000 livestock this year. All personnel in the province's industrial enterprises, economic organizations, and state organs guarantee to save 112,000 tugriks and invest it in the mutual aid fund of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives.

The young agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in Dzavhan province have proposed plans to increase monetary income, fixed assets, and working capital, and to reduce administrative expenses. The handicraft cooperatives throughout the province have decided to complete the annual financial plan seventy days ahead of schedule. The total number of livestock in the state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in Arkhangai province will increase by 20.6%, and the number of publicly raised livestock in the agricultural and pastoral cooperatives will increase by 3.3%.

The laboring people in various provinces have also put forward many specific guarantees in transportation, commerce, construction, and culture and education.

Recently, advanced collective units have continuously emerged in the widespread socialist competition. For example, the young workers of the Uvs province food processing plant organized a shock brigade to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." This shock brigade completes 165% of the monthly production plan. The employees of the handicraft cooperatives in Dundgovi province completed 122.5% of the plan in February. A timber harvesting team from the Ministry of Construction and Building Materials Industry completed 124% of the plan in February.

At present, the Mongolian people's patriotic movement to strive for the early completion of the Three-Year Plan is developing more widely and deeply, and news of completing and overfulfilling various production tasks ahead of schedule is constantly coming in.

    劳动人民热情高涨　生产捷报纷纷传来
    爱国劳动竞赛取得巨大成就
    新华社6日讯　据蒙古通讯社报道：蒙古各个生产战线上的劳动人民近几个月来热情高涨地开展着争取提前完成发展国民经济三年计划的爱国运动。这个运动的具体目标是提前完成1960年——三年计划最后一年的任务。
    目前，东戈壁、匝盆、巴彦乌列盖、科布多、乔巴山、库苏古尔、乌布沙诺尔、后杭爱、中戈壁和巴彦洪果尔等十多个省的劳动人民，都热烈地投入了这一社会主义竞赛运动。
    参加运动的各省人民都提出了自己的具体保证。例如，巴彦乌列盖省的劳动人民保证超额完成1960年的畜牧增殖计划，并超额10％完成各种农作物的生产计划。科布多省今年的播种面积将比去年扩大30％，产量将提高5.9％，手工业合作社的三年计划预计将提前三个月完成。乔巴山省的劳动人民保证超额完成已经制定的增殖牲畜头数3.7％的畜牧业生产计划，其中农牧业合作社的公养牲畜头数将增加6.7％。乌布沙诺尔省的农业劳动者保证开垦六千公顷土地，使播种面积达到一万三千七百七十五公顷。东戈壁省的劳动人民保证今年超额完成增加八十三万六千头牲畜的计划。这个省工业企业、经济组织和国家机关的全体人员保证节约十一万二千图格里克，并且把它投入农牧业合作社的互助基金中去。
    匝盆省年轻的农牧业合作社提出了增加货币收入、固定资金和周转资金以及减少行政管理开支的计划。全省的手工业合作社决定提前七十天完成全年的财务计划。后杭爱省国营农牧场的牲畜总头数将增加20.6％，农牧业合作社的公养牲畜头数将增加3.3％。
    各省劳动人民在交通运输、商业、建筑和文化教育等方面也都提出了许多具体保证。
    最近，在普遍的社会主义竞赛中不断涌现先进的集体单位。例如，乌布沙诺尔省食品联合厂的青年工人组织了一个争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的突击队，这个突击队每月完成生产计划的165％，中戈壁省手工业合作社的职工们在2月份完成了计划的122.5％，建筑和建筑材料工业部的一个木材采伐队在2月份完成了计划的124％。
  现在，蒙古人民争取提前完成三年计划的爱国运动正在更加广泛和深入地发展，提前和超额完成各项生产任务的消息不断传来。
