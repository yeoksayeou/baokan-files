Extracting "Heat" from "Cold"
Lu Ming

In winter, to keep warm, we can light a stove, at which point the heat comes from burning coal or wood. However, if a semiconductor microclimate regulator is installed indoors, it can help us extract heat from the cold outdoor air to provide indoor heating. This is extracting "heat" from "cold".

How do we extract heat from "cold"?

Let's first look at the wonderful phenomenon that has appeared in metals—conductors.

As early as the beginning of the nineteenth century, German scientist Seebeck welded two different metals together to form a closed loop. If there was a temperature difference between the two metals at the weld, then a weak current would be generated in the loop. Scientifically, this phenomenon is called the "thermoelectric effect".

Later, French scientist Peltier discovered an interesting phenomenon opposite to the "thermoelectric effect". Peltier welded the metals bismuth and antimony together. When he passed a current from bismuth to antimony, the temperature of the weld increased by thirty-seven degrees, that is, the weld released heat. However, when he passed a current from antimony to bismuth, the temperature of the weld dropped by forty-five degrees, that is, the weld absorbed heat. These two discoveries were as interesting and important as the "electromagnetic induction" phenomenon discovered by French scientist Faraday, but they did not attract much attention for a hundred years. Take the "thermoelectric effect," for example; because the current generated by the temperature difference was too small, it was only used for temperature measurement.

In the last two or three decades, scientists have conducted a large amount of research on semiconductors—materials with conductivity between conductors and insulators—and have renewed their interest in the above two phenomena, and have linked them to the development of the power industry.

The two phenomena mentioned above also exist in semiconductors, and are much stronger than in metal conductors, so they have practical significance.

If we connect semiconductors with properties like bismuth and antimony one after another in alternating directions, then when a current is passed in a certain direction, the connection point on one side will absorb heat, and the connection point on the other side will release heat. When the heat-absorbing connection point is placed in an insulated box, the heat in the box will be drawn away and released outside the box, and the box becomes a refrigerator. If the heat-absorbing point is related to the outdoor cold air, and the heat-releasing point is related to the indoor air, then when the current passes in the same direction, the heat of the outdoor cold air will be absorbed and released into the room from the heat-releasing point. In this way, the purpose of extracting "heat" from "cold" for heating is achieved!

In summer, a current can be passed in the opposite direction. Then, the original heat-releasing point in the room becomes the heat-absorbing point, and the original heat-absorbing point outside the room becomes the heat-releasing point. That is to say, the heat in the room is absorbed and sent to the outside, and the purpose of cooling and lowering the temperature in the room is achieved.

This semiconductor device is called a semiconductor microclimate regulator. As long as the magnitude of the current passed is controlled, the amount of heat released or absorbed can be adjusted. Ordinary metal conductors release as much heat as the amount of electrical energy passed. If the heat absorption and release capacity of this semiconductor microclimate regulator is also directly proportional to the current passed, then it would not be cost-effective to use. However, it has been theoretically proven long ago that, under normal circumstances, passing one kilowatt of electrical energy through this device can release ten kilowatts of thermal energy! However, due to heat loss and other reasons, the input electrical energy is about 50%-60% of the released thermal energy.

The Soviet Union has recently manufactured this semiconductor microclimate regulator in sanitary equipment factories. Tests of this semiconductor microclimate regulator have proven that the input electrical energy accounts for only 50% of the released thermal energy.

According to Soviet scientists, this phenomenon is the result of the concentration of energy in nature. The energy of nature cannot be created or destroyed, but can only be dispersed or concentrated.

Using semiconductor devices to generate electrical energy or thermal energy is a direct and effective utilization of solar energy. In the past, our utilization of other forms of energy, although also utilizing solar energy, was both troublesome and uneconomical. For example, wood, coal, or oil, they only store one percent of the solar energy they have absorbed, and it takes a long period of cultivation to make this bit of solar energy available to us.

Undoubtedly, when people master the laws of energy concentration in nature and gradually improve the tools for utilizing energy, mankind will obtain new energy sources that are much superior to atomic energy.

    “冷”中取“热”
    路明
    冬天为了取暖，可以生一炉火，这时，取暖的热量来自燃烧着的煤或者木材。可是，如果是在室内安上半导体微气候调节器，那末它就可以帮助我们从室外冷空气中夺取到热量，来供给室内的取暖。这就是“冷”中取“热”。
    如何从“冷”中取到“热”呢？
    让我们先看看在金属——导体中出现过的奇妙现象吧。
    还在十九世纪初，德国科学家塞别克把两块不同的金属焊接起来，组成一个闭合的环。如果在焊接处两块金属有着温度的差别，那末，在这个环路中就将有微弱的电流产生，科学上就把这个现
  象叫做“温差电现象”。
    后来，法国科学家帕尔帖又发现了和“温差电现象”相反的有趣现象。帕尔帖把金属铋和金属锑焊接起来，当他由铋到锑通过电流时，焊接点的温度升高了三十七度，也就是说，由焊接点放出了热量，可是当他由锑到铋通入电流时，焊接点的温度却下降了四十五度，也就是说，由焊接点吸收了热量。这两个发现本来和法国科学家法拉第发现的“电磁感应”现象一样的有趣而又重要，但是一百年来，并没有引起人们多大的注意。像“温差电现象”吧，由于温度差产生的电流太微小了，所以只被人们用于温度的测量而已。
    近二三十年来，科学家对于半导体——一种导电的能力介于导体与绝缘体之间的物体，进行了大量的研究，才重新对上面的那两个现象发生了兴趣，而且已经把它们和动力事业的发展联系起来了。
    在半导体里也有像上面所说的那两个现象存在，而且比起金属导体来要强烈得多，因此，就有实用的意义了。
    如果我们把有着铋和锑那样性质的半导体一个间一个地按照往复的方向联接起来，那末，当通入一定方向的电流时，一边的联接点就要吸热，一边的联接点就要放热。当吸热的联接点是放在隔热箱内时，这个箱子里的热量就要被吸走，而放到箱外来，这箱子就变成冰箱了。如果吸热点和室外冷空气发生关系，而放热点和室内空气发生关系，则在同样方向的电流通过时，室外冷空气的热量就被吸走，而从放热点放到室内来了。这样，从“冷”中吸取“热”来取暖的目的不就实现了吗！
    到了夏天，又可以反方向的办法通入电流，那末原来室内的放热点就变成了吸热点，原来室外的吸热点就变成了放热点。也就是说，室内的热量被吸走送到室外去了，室内达到了制冷降温的目的。
    这种半导体装置，就叫做半导体微气候调节器。只要操纵通入电流的大小，就可以调节放出或吸入的热量。一般的金属导体，通入多少电能就放出多少热量，如果这种半导体微气候调节器的吸热与放热的能力也是和通入的电流成一比一的关系，那末使用起来就未免不合算了。但是，在很早以前，理论上就证明，在一般情况下，通入这种装置一瓩的电能，就可以放出十瓩的热能！不过由于热损失等原因，输入的电能约为放出的热能的50％—60％。
    苏联最近在卫生设备工厂里已制造了这种半导体微气候调节器，在试验这种半导体微气候调节器时，已证明输入的电能只占放出热能的50％。
    据苏联科学家的解释：这种现象是因为自然界的能量集中的结果。自然界的能量不能创造也不能消灭，而只能被驱散或者被集中。
    用半导体装置来产生电能或者产生热能，都是对于太阳能的直接有效的利用。以前，我们利用别的形式的能量，虽然也就是利用太阳能，但都是既麻烦又不经济的。例如木材、煤或者石油，它们只储存了吸收过的太阳能的百分之一，而要使这一点太阳能被我们利用，要经过长期的培育。
    无可怀疑，当人们掌握了自然界能量集中规律并逐步改善利用能量的工具以后，人类将会获得比原子能还要优越得多的新能源。
