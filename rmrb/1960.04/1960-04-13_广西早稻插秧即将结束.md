Xinhua News Agency, Nanning - Except for the Guilin area in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where the temperature is still low and rice transplanting has just begun, the other five areas have either completed or are about to complete their transplanting work.

Rice is Guangxi's main high-yield grain crop. In order to obtain 60% of the year's grain from the early crop, after completing land reclamation and planting dryland crops in various regions, the Autonomous Region Party Committee promptly convened meetings, instructing all localities to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, advance victoriously, and vigorously grasp the large-scale balanced high yield of rice. Various regions launched a "four-catch" movement of "distant fields catching up with nearby fields, lean fields catching up with fertile fields, mountain valleys catching up with large fields, and low yield catching up with high yield" and an over-contracted production movement. At the same time, all regions strengthened leadership, concentrated superior labor forces, and vigorously engaged in a mass movement of "high efficiency, high quality." In Nanning Prefecture's fourteen counties, forty county Party secretaries, more than six hundred commune Party secretaries, and more than ten thousand brigade Party branch secretaries and team leaders went deep into production to lead production. Yulin Prefecture concentrated up to 89% of its labor force at its peak and launched a rice transplanting expert competition. In Guantang Brigade of Baisheng Commune, Liujiang County, all rice was transplanted using rice transplanters, combined with the use of new-style harrows. Seventy people used thirty-five rice transplanters to complete 72.9% of the transplanting plan in three days, with all specifications and quality meeting requirements. Transplanting throughout the autonomous region was generally one to two solar terms earlier than in the past.

The rapid progress of early rice transplanting in Guangxi this year is also a victory in the struggle against natural disasters. In March, there was little rainfall here, and some areas experienced drought. They also suffered from cold air attacks, and some areas in the north experienced seedling rot. In the face of natural disasters, all regions mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties in every possible way and try to seize the season.

    广西早稻插秧即将结束
    据新华社南宁讯　广西僮族自治区目前除气温较低的桂林专区才开始进入插秧大忙外，其余五个专区的插秧工作都已经相继结束或将要结束。
    水稻是广西的主要高产粮食作物。为了从今年上造拿回全年60％的粮食，自治区党委在各地完成开荒和播种旱地作物以后，就及时召开会议，指示各地戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，狠抓水稻大面积平衡高产。各地都开展了“远田赶近田、瘦田赶肥田、山冲赶大垌、低产赶高产”的“四赶”运动和超包产运动。同时，各地都加强领导，集中优势劳动力，大搞“高工效、高质量”的群众运动。南宁专区十四个县，有四十个县委书记、六百多个公社党委书记和一万多个大队党支书和队长，深入生产，领导生产。玉林专区最多的时候集中了89％的劳动力，并且开展了插秧能手竞赛运动。柳江县百棚公社官塘大队，全部用插秧机插秧，同时配合使用新式耙。七十个人用三十五部插秧机，在三天内就完成插秧计划72.9％，规格质量全部合乎要求。全自治区插秧普遍比过去提早一个到二个节令。
    广西今年早稻插秧进展得这样快，也是同自然灾害斗争的胜利。3月份，这里下雨少，部分地区出现旱象。又遭受冷空气袭击，北部有些地方发生烂秧。在天灾面前，各地都发动群众千方百计地战胜困难，尽量抢上季节。
