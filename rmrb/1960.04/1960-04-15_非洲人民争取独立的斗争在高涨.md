The struggle of African people for independence is rising
Today is "Africa Day" initiated by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and the All-African People's Conference. The Chinese people, together with the people of the world, resolutely support the African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and for national independence and its maintenance. The current situation in Africa is excellent. In the first spring of the 1960s, the African national independence movement is heading towards a new upsurge. This year, Togo, Somaliland, Congo, and Nigeria, among other African countries with a population of nearly 60 million, will achieve independent status. Thus, the population of independent African countries will account for two-thirds of the total population of Africa. Now, the Algerian people's national liberation war is being carried out victoriously; the South African people are launching a vigorous struggle against racial discrimination; the people of Central and East African countries resolutely oppose the deceptive conspiracies of the British colonialists and demand independence; the people of French West Africa and Equatorial African colonies are fighting to break free from the new shackles of the "Community"; the people of the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique have also voiced their fighting spirit. The long night of the African people is about to pass, and the dawn is rising, bathing the land of free Africa. (Attached pictures)

    非洲人民争取独立的斗争在高涨
    今天是亚非人民团结理事会和全非人民大会所发起的“非洲日”。中国人民和全世界人民一道坚决支持非洲人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争。目前的非洲，呈现出一片大好形势。在六十年代的第一个春天，非洲民族独立运动正在走向新的高涨。今年将有多哥、索马里兰、刚果和尼日利亚等包括近六千万人口的非洲国家取得独立地位。这样，非洲独立国家的人口将要占到全非总人口的三分之二。现在，阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争正在胜利地进行着；南非人民正在如火如荼地展开着反对种族歧视的斗争；中非和东非各国人民坚决反对英国殖民者的欺骗阴谋，而要求独立；法属西非和赤道非洲殖民地人民正在为挣脱“共同体”的新枷锁而斗争；葡萄牙殖民地安哥拉、莫三鼻给人民也发出了战斗的声音。非洲人民的漫漫长夜即将逝去，黎明的曙光正在升起，并将沐浴自由非洲的大地。（附图片）
