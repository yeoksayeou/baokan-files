    Old Milling Machine "Leaps to the Sky"
    Delegate Su Guangming Discusses the Automation of Milling Machines

    Chairman, fellow delegates:
    I wholeheartedly endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I will unite with the broad masses of workers in my future work to conscientiously implement them.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our country achieved another great victory of continued Great Leap Forward in 1959. In these years of continuous Great Leap Forward, our Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, under the direct leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, has also rejuvenated and undergone a new look day by day, leaping from being only able to repair freight cars to being able to manufacture brand new ones. With the rapid development of the entire revolutionary construction cause, and with the kind concern, cultivation, and education of the Party, and the enthusiastic help of comrades, my political, cultural, and technical levels have gradually improved. In particular, under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the inspiration and encouragement of the Twelfth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, I further liberated my thinking and raised my awareness; and together with everyone, I vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution in production, thereby learning and mastering some new technologies and advanced production methods, guaranteeing the early and over-fulfillment of the production tasks assigned to me by the leadership. In recent years, I have learned and mastered more than fifty kinds of advanced experiences from home and abroad, realized more than one hundred and thirty technical innovations, and increased production efficiency by one to eighty-eight times respectively; thereby enabling me to complete forty-eight months and sixteen days of work in eight months and sixteen days of production time in 1959, on the basis of completing the workload of the Second Five-Year Plan four years ahead of schedule. Now I am doing the work for August 1971. The Party and the people have given great encouragement and honor to these small achievements of mine, awarding me the honorary titles of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City Labor Model, and appointing me as an engineer. Not long ago, I attended the National Conference of Heroes, and an ordinary worker like me was able to receive such great honor and become an engineer, which was something I dared not even think about in the old society.
    In recent years, I have deeply realized that in order to develop our country's socialist construction cause at a high speed, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in order to rapidly improve labor productivity. Therefore, in production activities, according to the Party's instructions, I actively carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. As long as it is beneficial to production, even a small improvement, we never let it go; we actively learn various advanced experiences and vigorously carry out innovation and creation, which has enabled me to continuously move forward. Take the photoelectric program control milling machine I am currently using as an example, it has become a modern milling machine from an old ox-like milling machine through continuous large and small improvements. This machine was produced in Germany in 1928 and is now thirty-two years old. Because it has been used for too many years, many parts have been replaced, and it clangs loudly when it is turned on, resulting in low production efficiency. In recent years, under the leadership and support of the Party, comrades and I have cooperated and made more than one hundred improvements, making it a semi-automatic milling machine with higher efficiency and faster speed. However, with the rapid development of the socialist construction cause, production tasks are becoming increasingly large, which prompts us to further tap the potential of equipment to meet production needs. I often pondered how to further improve this old milling machine, but I couldn't come up with a good solution. Last November, after the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Harbin Municipal Party Committee issued a call to march towards mechanization and automation, many automated production lines and automated machine tools appeared in Harbin, which gave me great inspiration and encouragement. The factory Party committee also put forward the call of "old soldiers taking new guns, old factories putting on new clothes." Especially this year, at the Harbin Labor Model Conference, the leading comrades encouraged me, saying, "Old Su! You must transform your old milling machine into a rare milling machine in the world." I was very excited after hearing this and couldn't sleep well for several nights. I thought repeatedly: the working class is the class with the most far-reaching prospects, and we must not only transform the old world but also create a new world. As an old worker, I should have even greater ambitions and lofty ideals, dare to think and dare to act. What the world has, we must have, and what the world does not have, we must also have. Therefore, I made up my mind to let this old milling machine leap to the sky in one step and become a fully automated milling machine. In February of this year, under the leadership and care of the Party, and with the strong support of the Industrial University, scientific research departments, and brother factories, after seventeen days and nights of hard work and more than twenty repeated experiments, it was finally converted into a photoelectric program-controlled automated milling machine, which laid a better foundation for me to achieve a greater leap forward in the future. But I know that technological development is endless, and we cannot be satisfied with these achievements. We must continue to advance on the existing foundation.
    In recent years, the Party's education has made me deeply realize that as an advanced producer, I should not only continuously leap forward myself but also help others to advance together with me. At the National Conference of Heroes, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "One flower does not make a spring; a hundred flowers blooming is spring." This means that every advanced producer must help others to quickly reach an advanced level. Because the socialist construction cause needs the people of the whole country to realize it. One person's advancement is always fighting alone, and the advancement of everyone can move mountains and overturn seas. Only by turning the production level of advanced producers into the social production level can we guarantee the continuous and high-speed development of the socialist construction cause. Therefore, I regard helping others to carry out technical innovation, solve production key issues, and disseminate and promote advanced experience as my bounden duty. Sometimes I would rather put down my own work to help others solve technical problems so that everyone can leap forward. I also often discuss technology with the old workers in our milling machine group, help apprentices improve their awareness and technical level, and mobilize everyone to carry out competitions with the Harbin model - the Sino-Soviet Friendship Youth Group in our workshop. In this way, through the joint efforts of the comrades in the group, the production level of our milling machine group won the honorary title of collective champion in the selection competition of the first Harbin Production Games at the end of 1959, and I personally won the city's milling machine champion. When I saw the group win the championship and the apprentices become red flag bearers; when I saw the comrades achieve new achievements, I was happy from the bottom of my heart. Of course, when I helped others, I also learned a lot. Especially when everyone caught up, I had to work even harder to stay ahead. Facts have proved that the process of helping others is actually the process of learning from others' experiences. Only by helping each other and promoting each other can we continuously improve and leap forward.
    In recent years, the reason why I have been able to make some achievements is the result of the Party's education and training. Without the Party's leadership, I would not be able to accomplish anything. Just like everyone said: thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first thing; as long as we act according to the Party's instructions, we will surely win!
    In this era of the Great Leap Forward, our working class bears even more important responsibilities. I am determined to raise the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher together with the people of the whole country, study Chairman Mao's works hard, and continuously improve my ideological level. Unite the broad masses of workers and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution; this year, we will realize sixty technical improvements and complete thirty-three months of workload. Before "May Day," we will work with the entire group of workers to transform all the old machine tools in the group into automated machine tools, and work with the workers in the workshop to realize three automated production lines for axle tiles, hook tongues, and axle box screws. Before the end of May, our workshop will become an automated workshop, let it put on new clothes and take up new guns, and contribute greater strength in realizing the new tasks in the new stage of socialist construction! I resolutely listen to the Party forever, and go wherever the Party points. Strive to improve my political ideology and technical level, and be a red and expert engineer. Contribute all my strength to the socialist cause and the highest ideal of mankind—the communist cause.
    I wish the conference a successful conclusion, and I wish all the delegates good health!

    老铣床“一步登天”
    苏广铭代表谈铣床自动化的经过主席团、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理所作的报告，并在今后工作中团结广大职工认真贯彻执行。
    我们的国家，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年又获得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。在这连续大跃进的年代里，我们哈尔滨车辆厂，在中共黑龙江省委和哈尔滨市委的直接领导下，也返老还童，面貌日新，由只能修理一跃而能制造崭新的货车了。随着整个革命建设事业的迅速发展，在党的亲切关怀、培养教育和同志们的热情帮助下，使我在政治、文化和技术水平上都逐渐有所提高。特别是在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召以及中共黑龙江省委第十二次扩大会议的启发鼓舞下，使我进一步解放了思想，提高了觉悟；并和大家一道在生产中大闹技术革新和技术革命，从而学习和掌握了一些新技术和先进的生产方法，保证了提前超额完成领导上交给我的生产任务。近几年来，我一共学习和掌握了五十多种国内外的先进经验，实现了一百三十多项技术革新，生产效率分别提高一至八十八倍；从而使我在提前四年完成第二个五年计划工作量的基础上，又在1959年，用八个月零十六天的生产时间，完成了四十八个月零十六天的工作量。现在我正在做1971年8月份的活。党和人民对我的这些微小的成绩，给了很大的鼓励和荣誉，授予黑龙江省和哈尔滨市劳动模范的光荣称号，并被任命为工程师。不久前出席了全国群英会，像我这样一个普通的工人，能够得到这样大的荣誉。还当上了工程师，这在旧社会是连想也不敢想的事情。
    几年来，我深刻的体会到：要想高速度发展我国社会主义建设事业，必须大搞技术革新和技术革命，才能迅速提高劳动生产率。因此，在生产活动中，根据党的指示，积极进行了技术革新和技术革命。只要对生产有利，那怕是一点点小的改进，我们从不放过；积极学习各种先进经验，大搞革新创造，这就使我不断地前进。就拿我现在使用的这台光电程序控制铣床来说，就是经过大大小小地不断改进，才使它由原来像老牛似的铣床，变成为现代化铣床的。这台床子，是1928年德国出产的，今年已经三十二年了。由于使用的年头太多，许多部件都是后配的，一开车就叮当乱响，生产效率低。几年来，在党的领导和支持下，同志们和我合作，前后进行了一百多次改进，使它成为效率较高、速度较快的半自动化铣床了。但是随着社会主义建设事业一日千里的发展，生产任务越来越大，这就促使我们进一步挖掘设备潜力，适应生产需要。我就经常琢磨怎样使这台老铣床再提高一步，但是总没想出一个好办法来。去年11月份，黑龙江省委和哈尔滨市委发出向机械化、自动化进军的号召后，哈尔滨出现许多自动化生产线和自动化机床，这给我很大的启发和鼓舞。工厂党委又提出了“老兵拿新枪，老厂换新装”的号召。特别是今年在哈尔滨劳模会上市的领导同志鼓舞我说：“老苏啊！你要把你那台老铣床改造成为世界上少有的铣床”。我听了之后非常激动，几夜都没有睡好觉，我反复想：工人阶级是最有远大前途的阶级，我们不仅要改造旧世界，还要创造新世界。我是一个老工人，更应有雄心壮志和远大理想，要敢想敢干，世界上有的我们要有，世界上没有的我们也要有。因此我就下定决心，一定让这台老铣床一步登天，成为全部自动化的铣床。今年2月，在党的领导和关怀下，在工业大学、科学研究部门和兄弟工厂的大力支持下，苦战了十七昼夜，经过二十多次的反复试验，终于改制成光电程序控制的自动化铣床，这为我今后实现更大跃进打下了更好的基础。但是我知道，技术发展是无止境的，不能满足于这点成绩，还要在现有的基础上继续前进。
    几年来，党对我的教育，使我深深地体会到：作为一个先进生产者，不仅自己要不断跃进，而且还应该帮助别人和自己一起前进。在全国群英会上，李富春副总理在报告中讲：“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”。就是要每一个先进生产者都要帮助别人迅速达到先进水平。因为社会主义建设事业需要全国人民来实现。一人先进总是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海。只有把先进生产者的生产水平变成社会生产水平，才能保证社会主义建设事业不断地、高速度地发展。因此，我把帮助别人进行技术革新、解决生产关键和传播推广先进经验，看作是自己义不容辞的责任。有时候我宁肯放下自己的活去帮助别人解决技术问题，让大家都跃进。我还经常和我们铣工小组内的老工人一起研究技术，帮助徒工提高觉悟和技术水平，发动大家和哈尔滨市的标兵——我们车间的中苏友谊青年小组开展竞赛。这样，经过小组同志们的共同努力，我们铣工小组的生产水平，在1959年末哈尔滨第一届生产运动会选拔赛中，获得了集体冠军的光荣称号，我个人也获得了全市铣工冠军。当我看到小组获得冠军，徒工当上了红旗手的时候；当我看到同志们获得新成就的时候，我是从心里往外高兴。当然，我在帮助别人的时候，自己也学到了很多东西。特别是当大家都赶上来了，我就更得加倍努力，保持上游。事实证明：帮助别人的过程，实际上就是学习别人经验的过程。只有互相帮助，互相促进，才能使自己不断提高，不断跃进。
    几年来，我所以能够作出一些成绩来，都是党的教育和培养的结果。若没有党的领导，我什么也做不成。真像大家所说的那样：千条万条，党的领导第一条；只要按着党的指示去办事，就一定胜利！
    在这大跃进的年代里，我们工人阶级担负着更为重要的责任。我决心和全国人民一道，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，努力学习毛主席的著作，不断提高自己的思想水平。团结广大职工群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命；在今年内要实现六十项技术改进，完成三十三个月的工作量。在“五一”前和全组工人一道把小组的老机床全部改成自动化机床，并和车间的工人在一起实现轴瓦、钩舌、轴箱螺丝三条自动化生产线。在5月末以前，我们的车间变成一个自动化的车间，叫他穿上新装，拿起新枪，在实现社会主义建设新阶段新任务中贡献出更大的力量！我坚决永远听党的话，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里。努力提高自己的政治思想和技术水平，作一个又红又专的工程师。为社会主义事业，为人类最高的理想——共产主义事业，贡献出我的全部力量。
    祝大会胜利成功，祝各位代表身体健康！
