Comrades,
    I fully agree with the Report on the 1960 National Economic Plan made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I suggest that the congress adopt and approve them.
    From the above reports, it can be seen that the great victory achieved in the socialist construction cause being carried out by the Chinese people is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of the People's Communes. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, 1960 has seen an even better and more comprehensive situation of sustained Great Leap Forward. This excellent situation is very encouraging and greatly inspires and strengthens our confidence and strength in building socialism.
    Please allow me to briefly speak at the conference about some of the situations of several People's Communes I have inspected. If there are any improprieties, please correct me, fellow representatives.
    
    The Qunying People's Commune Conquers "Hungry Tiger Ridge"
    First of all, it is because the establishment of the People's Commune has opened up a broad road for the development of production. Our Qunying People's Commune in Liulonggou, Yi County, Liaoning Province, was originally a remote and poor mountainous area, with a total area of about 64,000 hectares, including more than 450,000 mu of barren mountains connected by gullies. The commune has 6,632 households, with a population of 31,823, distributed in 203 mountain gullies. There are 135,300 mu of cultivated land, of which more than two-thirds are distributed on steep slopes of 30 to 40 degrees, with a soil layer of only three or four inches. Before liberation, the yield per mu was at most 60 to 70 jin of grain. Although this is a mountainous area, animal husbandry is not developed, and the people's lives are also very difficult. In the past, people said:
        Bare mountains and thin land, Liulonggou,
        When it rains, sand and stones flow down;
        If it doesn't rain for ten days, the seedlings are yellow and thin,
        In the rainy season, the stones are exposed;
        Good land yields four or five dou of grain,
        Mountain land yields only a handful;
        Half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain,
        The people's lives are bitter and worried.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the local people began to march towards the poor mountainous area and launched a battle against Hungry Tiger Ridge (as people have always called this place). During the period of agricultural cooperation, many measures were taken to increase production, which increased the agricultural output from 60 to 70 jin per mu in the past to 126 jin, and the corresponding people's lives also improved to a certain extent. However, due to the small organizational scale and narrow scope of activities of the original agricultural cooperatives, many contradictions and difficulties still existed and were not easy to solve. For example, in the construction of mountainous areas, there were contradictions between mountain management and agricultural management competing for labor, and between grazing and afforestation competing for mountain tops; coupled with difficulties such as insufficient funds and weak material foundations, it resulted in people planting trees without protecting them, cattle and sheep eating up the grass slopes and entering the forest area, and the survival rate of various mountain forests and fruit trees being very low every year. Due to serious soil erosion on the mountains, exposed rocks, and a gradual shrinking of the grazing area, the development of diversified operations was hindered to a certain extent. Agriculture was short of grain every year, and the state had to supply an average of 3 million to 3.4 million jin every year.
    After the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune's Party committee, unified planning and leadership of production were implemented, solving the contradiction between closing mountains for afforestation and grazing; and the shortage of labor caused by the increase in labor in agriculture itself due to the vigorous support of industry to agriculture since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In order to solve this problem, the People's Commune organized large-scale collaboration between brigades and teams, adjusting 8,025 mu of interplanted land, turning distant land into nearby land. In 1958, the entire commune saved more than 37,000 labor days and more than 74,900 animal labor days. In addition, the improvement of agricultural tools also completely resolved the contradiction between mountain management and agriculture competing for labor, which had existed for many years. In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, due to mutual support and cooperation between brigades and teams, a vigorous winter and spring campaign in 1958 completed more than 195,000 earth and stone works, built three small reservoirs, diverted water from rivers in two places, built 5,200 meters of main canals, dug 510 large wells, and excavated 13 water storage ponds, storing 845,000 cubic meters of water, which could irrigate 8,145 mu of dry land, increasing the irrigated area by four times, thus basically eliminating the threat of drought and flood.
    With the improvement of natural conditions, the confidence of the commune members in striving for a greater leap forward in agriculture was greatly encouraged. After the communization in 1958, although it encountered severe natural disasters such as frost, drought, etc., due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture", it still won a great agricultural harvest. In the past, what was always referred to as a poor mountain ravine short of grain turned into a surplus grain commune. Not only did it not need the state to supply grain, but on the contrary, in 1958, it sold more than 2 million jin of grain to the state after setting aside enough seeds, rations, and feed. Although the sown area of grain in 1959 was reduced by 5,940 mu compared with 1958, and it also encountered drought in the later stage of sowing and insect pests in the summer, the total output still increased by 16.4% compared with 1958.
    In order to rapidly develop animal husbandry, the commune established seven livestock breeding stations, one livestock breeding farm, and six livestock disease prevention stations, which led to an unprecedented development of animal husbandry. The number of pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, etc. has increased exponentially. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and commune-run industries have all achieved rapid development. It can be imagined that without the People's Commune, this place, which used to be called a poor mountain ravine, would not have developed so quickly in production, and the backward face of the poor and backward mountainous area would not have been fundamentally changed.
    Secondly, with the development of production, the people's lives and cultural and welfare undertakings have also been greatly improved. The commune has established a total of 184 canteens, 6 homes for the elderly, 66 nurseries, and 162 kindergartens, allowing more than 4,000 female laborers to leave their stoves and kitchens and throw themselves into the vigorous production front lines, participating in production labor like men. In the past, the commune only had one health center. Now the commune has one hospital, one maternity hospital, and five medical points, with the number of doctors increasing to 32, changing the backward situation of having no doctors when sick and no medicine when asking for a doctor. After the establishment of the commune, the number of primary schools increased to 42, and the number of students increased to 5,950, with all school-age children enrolled. Before the establishment of the commune, there was only one public middle school with 200 students. Now, three new agricultural middle schools have been built with 450 students, which is more than double the past. The commune has also newly built a large-scale club, with an amateur theater troupe, and all major teams have libraries. The commune also has a film projection team. At the same time, buses also run in the mountain gullies, and all production teams have connected to wired broadcasting, so that commune members can hear major events at home and abroad while sitting in their houses. The above is the development and changes of the Liulonggou People's Commune in Yi County.

    Xijiao People's Commune Transforms from Poor to Rich in One Year
    Due to the development of production, the income of commune members in the Xijiao People's Commune in Jinzhou City has also increased accordingly. In 1959, the average income per household in the commune was 513 yuan, and the average income per person was 112 yuan, an increase of 47% compared with the income of 78 yuan per household in 1958. Among the 27 production brigades in the commune, 5 teams implemented the food supply system, 18 teams implemented the full grain supply system, and 5 teams implemented the half grain supply system. Nine teams in the poorer mountainous areas of the commune have changed the face of poor teams and caught up with the income level of rich teams in one year in 1959. For example, the poorer Jiangtun team had an income of 42 yuan per person in 1958, which increased to 82 yuan in 1959, almost doubling. Not only did the poor teams increase their income, but the rich teams also increased their income. In 1958, the Jixiang team had the highest income, with an average income of 184 yuan per person, which increased to 216 yuan in 1959. According to the party branch secretary of the Tangzhuang production team, the milk produced by the team, in addition to supplying a portion to Jinzhou City, the elderly and children in the team can drink fresh milk every day. With the increase in commune members' income, the purchasing power of commune members has also increased unprecedentedly. The Brick and Tile Kiln Production Team has a total of 390 households, with 120 bicycles and 65 sewing machines. Many people also wear watches. The commune has two homes for the elderly, with 25 elderly people living in them. During my inspection, I visited a home for the elderly, and an 80-year-old man said with great emotion: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would people like us, who have no family and no home, go! Now the People's Commune is my home, and the Happiness Home is the nursing home I am most satisfied with." While ensuring the increase in commune members' income, the commune also increased public accumulation and expanded the ingredients of commune ownership. In 1959 alone, 1.23 million yuan was deposited, plus more than 1.8 million yuan accumulated in 1958, to buy eight tractors and twenty diesel engines, thus ensuring the needs of expanded reproduction. The commune members of the Hongluoxian People's Commune in Jinxi County increased their income by 43.7% in 1959 compared with 1958. Among the 34 brigades, there were three teams with an average of more than 100 yuan per capita, 20 teams with more than 80 yuan, and the rest also had varying degrees of increase compared with 1958. In 1959, the sideline production income of the commune was 1.17 million yuan, an increase of 89.3% compared with 1958, with an average sideline production income of 20 yuan per person. Six famous poor teams, due to vigorous operations, caught up with and exceeded the income level of rich teams in 1959 and removed the hats of poor teams. In 1958, the Tianjiatun Brigade also borrowed 150,000 yuan from the bank, but in 1959, it had deposits of 140,000 yuan. The party branch secretary of the Maojiagou Production Team of the commune said that in the past, our place had the most difficult life. There were many mountains and little land, and the produced fruits were worthless and could not be exchanged for food to feed ourselves. We lived a life of half a year of bran and vegetables and half a year of grain. In order to survive, people ran around and left their homes, but in the old society, it was the same everywhere. There was no place for the poor to live and make a living. After liberation, we worked happily and were no longer subject to exploitation and oppression. Life is getting better year by year, especially after communization. One laborer earned five or six hundred yuan a year. It's really endless to eat, wear, and use. During my inspection, no matter which commune or production team I went to, or which commune member I asked, they all happily told me that we can live such a good life today thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. "Listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party." This is the voice and conclusion of the people.
    
    Again, thanks to the education of the Party, the continuous development of production, and the continuous improvement of life, the vast number of commune members and cadres have carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do. Especially after the education of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the anti-rightist, boosting morale, and rectification movement, everyone is in a happy mood, full of energy, high-spirited, and full of fighting spirit. The Party committee secretary of the Hongluoxian People's Commune in Jinxi County said: "In the past, commune members worked hard, practically, and skillfully, but now they spontaneously add secretly." The commune members of the Maojiagou Production Team get up to work at 2:30 in the night and go to ring the bell at 4:00 because they are afraid of falling behind others. Two women in the Liutaizi Production Team of the Jinxi Town People's Commune went to the field to cut grain before dawn during the autumn harvest last year. One cut from east to west and the other cut from west to east. When the two met in the morning, they realized that both had come long ago. Li Delin, an old commune member of the Yingbishan Production Team, is over 80 years old this year. Although the commune's cadres have repeatedly persuaded him not to participate in labor, he always wants to do some work and make a contribution to the cause of socialist construction. In the words of this old man himself: "Although I am old, I will do my best. This will also have a good impact on young people." During the drought resistance in the spring of 1959, he actively participated in watering the fields. During the summer hoeing period, where the progress was slow, he would go there and give great enlightenment and education to the young people. Because he and his blind wife have a very happy life in their later years, and the commune takes care of their lives in every possible way, he often tells people: "The commune is paradise, Chairman Mao is like the sun, and the Communist Party is our parents."
    In the past year or so, the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in our country in various fields, the speed of socialist construction is really one day equals twenty years. Without the leadership of the Party, without the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, it is simply unimaginable. The People's Commune is one of the three major treasures of our country's socialist construction period. It is the product of Mao Zedong Thought and the product of the Great Leap Forward. The People's Commune is very good. Practice has proved that the great achievements made by the People's Commune in all aspects have powerfully smashed the slanders and attacks of domestic and foreign enemies and right-leaning opportunists against the People's Commune.
    Fellow representatives, the task of developing the national economy in 1960, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, is to: "Better implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, strive for a continued, comprehensive, and better leap forward in the national economy." In order to realize this task, Vice Premier Li Fuchun also pointed out in his report: The arrangement of the national economic plan for 1960 should further determine that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined with each other. We should continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key in industry, grain as the key in agriculture, and making overall arrangements, etc. In order to promote the development of the entire national economy and realize the agricultural production task for 1960, it is necessary to give full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, "large in size and collective in nature," promote agricultural technical transformation, and improve agricultural labor productivity so that it can adapt to the needs of objective development.
    Fellow representatives, the task in 1960 is arduous and glorious. I express that I will resolutely implement the spirit of the conference, actively serve around the central task of the Party, strengthen political and ideological transformation, always listen to the Party's words, and go wherever the Party points, hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of sustained leap forward in the national economy in 1960!

    公社之花到处盛开
    宁武代表介绍辽宁两个人民公社迅速发展的情况各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理向大会所作于关1960年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理所作关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告、全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，建议大会通过并予以批准。
    从上述报告中可以看出，我国人民进行着的社会主义建设事业所取得的巨大胜利，就是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，人民公社的胜利。1960年在1958、1959两年大跃进的基础上，又出现了更好更全面地持续大跃进的局面。这个大好的形势十分振奋人心，而且大大地鼓舞和加强了我们对建设社会主义的信心和力量。
    请允许我把下边视察过几个人民公社的一些情况，在大会上作一简单的发言，如有不妥之处，请各位代表予以指正。
    群英人民公社战胜了“饿虎岭”
    首先是由于人民公社的成立，为发展生产开辟了广阔的道路。我们辽宁省义县留龙沟群英人民公社，原来是个偏僻贫困的山区，总面积约六万四千公顷，其中有四十五万余亩沟岔相连的荒山，全社有六千六百三十二户，三万一千八百二十三口人，分布在二百零三个山沟里，有十三万五千三百亩耕地，其中三分之二以上分布于三十度至四十度的陡坡上，土层只有三、四寸，解放前每亩地产粮至多六十斤至七十斤。这里虽是山区，但畜牧业并不发达，人民生活也很苦，过去人们说这里是：
        秃山薄地留龙沟，
        下雨沙石往下流；
        十天不雨苗黄瘦，
        雨多之季露石头；
        好地打粮四五斗，
        山地打粮一摄收；
        半年糠菜半年粮，
        人民生活苦又愁。
    解放后当地人民在党的领导下，开始向贫困的山区进军，向饿虎岭（过去人们一向这样称呼这个地方）展开了搏斗。在农业合作化时期，由于采取了许多增产措施，使农业产量由过去亩产六十斤至七十斤提高到一百二十六斤，相应的人民生活也有了一定的提高。但由于原来农业社的组织规模小，活动范围窄，仍然存在许多矛盾和困难不易解决。如在进行山区建设中，存在着治山和经营农业争劳力，放牧和造林争山头的矛盾；加上资金不足、物资基础薄弱等困难，因此，形成有人造林无人护林，牛羊啃光草坡进入林区，年年造林不见林，各种山林、果树成活率都是很低的。由于山上水土流失严重，岩石裸露，放牧面积逐渐缩小，多种经营的发展受到了一定阻碍。农业年年缺粮，平均每年要靠国家供应三百万斤到三百四十万斤。
    公社成立后，在公社党委统一领导下，实行统一规划，统一领导生产，解决了封山育林与放牧的矛盾；和由于1958年大跃进以来，农业大力支援工业，农业本身用工量的增多而出现的劳动力紧张的情况。为了解决这个问题，人民公社组织大队小队之间的大协作，调整了插花地八千零二十五亩，使远地变成了近地，全社在1958年节省劳力三万七千多个、畜工七万四千九百多个，加上改良农具等，使过去存在多年解决不了的治山与农业争劳力的矛盾，也得到了彻底的解决。在农田水利建设方面，由于大队小队之间，彼此支援，互相协作，1958年大干一冬春，完成十九万五千多土石方工程，修筑三座小型水库，拦河引水两处，修干渠五千二百米，打大井五百一十眼，挖蓄水池十三个，贮水八十四万五千方，能灌溉旱田八千一百四十五亩，灌溉面积增加四倍，从此基本上免除了旱涝灾的威胁。
    随着自然条件的改善，大大地鼓舞了社员们争取农业更大跃进的信心。1958年公社化以后，虽然遇到了严重的风霜干旱等自然灾害，由于认真贯彻执行了“农业八字宪法”，仍然赢得了农业大丰收。过去一向被人们称为缺粮的穷山沟变成了余粮社，不仅不用国家供应粮食，相反地除留足种子、口粮、饲料外，1958年还卖给国家二百余万斤粮食。1959年虽然粮谷播种面积比1958年减少五千九百四十亩，同时在播种后期还遇到了干旱和夏季的虫灾，但是总产量仍较1958年提高16.4％。
    公社为了迅速的发展畜牧业，建立了七个畜牧配种站，一处牲畜繁殖场，六处家畜防治站，使畜牧业得到了空前的大发展。猪、牛、羊、鸡等都有了成倍的增长。农林牧副渔，社办工业都有了飞跃的发展。可以设想，如果没有人民公社，这个过去一向被人称为穷山沟的地方，在生产上就不会发展的这么快，贫穷落后的山区面貌，也不会从根本上得到改变。
    其次，随着生产的发展，人民生活、文化福利事业也得到了巨大的改善。该社共举办一百八十四个食堂、六所敬老院，六十六处托儿所，一百六十二处幼儿园，使四千多名妇女劳动力离开锅台灶旁，投入轰轰烈烈的各项生产战线，和男人一样参加生产劳动。过去该社仅有一个卫生所，现在公社有一个医院，一个妇产院，五个医疗点，医生增加到三十二名，改变了过去有病无医、请医无药的落后状况。公社成立后小学增加到四十二所，学生增加到五千九百五十名，适龄儿童全部入了学，公社成立前只有一所公立中学，有学生二百名，现在新建三所农业中学，学生四百五十名，等于过去的一倍多。该社还新修大型俱乐部一座，有业余剧团一个，各大队都设有图书馆，公社还有电影放映队，同时，山沟里也通了公共汽车，各个生产小队都接上了有线广播，社员坐在屋里就可以听到国内外的大事情，以上是义县留龙沟人民公社发展变化情况。
      西郊人民公社一年由穷变富
    锦州市西郊人民公社，由于生产的发展，社员的收入也随着增加了。该社1959年平均每户收入五百一十三元，平均每人收入一百一十二元，比1958年每户收入七十八元，增加47％。全社二十七个生产大队，其中有五个队实行了伙食供给制，十八个队实行了粮食全部供给，五个队实行了粮食半供给。该社过去比较贫困的山区有九个队改变了穷队的面貌，在1959年一年内就赶上了富队收入的水平。如较穷的姜屯队，1958年每人收入四十二元，1959年增加到八十二元，几乎增加一倍。不仅穷队增加了收入，富队同样也增加了收入。1958年吉祥队收入最高，每人平均收入一百八十四元，1959年增加到二百一十六元。唐庄生产队生产的牛奶，据该队党支部书记介绍说：除供应一部分给锦州市外，队里的老人、小孩每天都能喝到鲜牛奶。随着社员收入的增加，社员购买力也空前提高了。砖瓦窑子生产队共三百九十户，有自行车一百二十辆，缝纫机六十五台，许多人还戴上了手表。这个社有两所敬老院，住院的老人二十五名。我在视察期间访问了一个敬老院，有一位八十多岁的老人很受感动地说：要没有共产党和毛主席，像我们这样无家无业的人，往哪奔呢！现在人民公社就是我的家，幸福院就是我最满意的养老院。该社在保证社员增加收入的前提下，同时增加了公共积累，扩大了公社所有的成份，仅1959年就提存一百二十三万元，加上1958年积累一百八十多万元，买拖拉机八台，柴油机二十台，从而保证了扩大再生产的需要。锦西县虹螺岘人民公社，社员1959年收入较1958年增加43.7％。在三十四个大队中，按人口平均，超过百元的有三个队，超过八十元有二十个队，其余的也较1958年有不同程度的增加。该社1959年副业生产收入一百一十七万元，比1958年增加89.3％，平均每口人副业生产收入二十元。六个有名的穷队，由于大搞经营，1959年收入赶上和超过了富队收入水平，摘掉了穷队的帽子。田家屯大队，1958年还向银行贷款十五万元，1959年反有存款十四万元。该社毛家沟生产队党支部书记说，过去我们这个地方生活最困难，山多地少，出产的水果不值钱，换不回来糊口的粮食，过着半年糠菜半年粮的生活。人们为了活下去，东奔西走，背井离乡，但是旧社会到哪里都是一样，没有穷人立足得以谋生的地方。解放后，我们高高兴兴的劳动，再不受剥削和压迫了，生活一年好似一年，特别是公社化以后，一个劳动力一年挣了五、六百元，真是吃不了，穿不完、用不尽。我在视察期间，不论去到那个公社，那个生产队，问到那个社员，他们都乐滋滋地向我说，我们今天所以能过着这样的美好生活，都是共产党和毛主席给我们的。“听毛主席的话，跟共产党走。”这就是人民群众的心声和结论。
    再次，由于党的教育，生产不断发展，生活不断提高，广大社员和干部，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，特别是经过党的八届八中全会，反右倾、鼓干劲、整风运动的教育，个个心情舒畅，干劲冲天、意气风发、斗志昂扬。锦西县虹螺岘人民公社党委书记说：过去社员是苦干、实干、巧干，现在又自发的加上偷着干。毛家沟生产队的社员，夜里两点半钟起来干活，四点钟才去打钟，原因是怕落在别人的后边。锦西镇人民公社刘台子生产队两名妇女，去年秋收时，天没有亮下地割谷子，一个从东往西割，一个从西往东割，天亮两个人碰了头，才知道双方早就来了。影璧山生产队老社员李德林今年八十多岁了，公社的干部虽然一再解劝，不让他参加劳动了，可是他老是要干点活，为社会主义建设事业作出一点贡献。用这位老年人自己的话说：“我虽然年纪大了些，我有一分力量，就做出一分来，这样对青年也会有好的影响。”在1959年春起抗旱时，积极主动地参加浇地，夏锄期间那里进度慢，他就到那里去，对青年人启发教育很大。由于他和双目失明的老伴，晚年生活过的很幸福，公社对他们的生活照顾的无微不至，所以经常向人讲：“公社是天堂，毛主席像太阳，共产党是爹娘”。
    一年多以来，我国在各个方面所发生的翻天覆地的变化，社会主义建设的速度真是一天等于二十年，如果没有党的领导，没有总路线、大跃进、人民公社是根本不可想像的。人民公社是我国社会主义建设时期的三大法宝之一，是毛泽东思想的产物，是大跃进的产物，人民公社好得很。实践证明人民公社在各方面取得的巨大成绩，都有力地粉碎了国内外敌人和右倾机会主义分子对人民公社的诬蔑和进攻。
    各位代表，1960年发展国民经济的任务，正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的那样，要：“更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，在过去两年大跃进的基础上，争取国民经济继续全面的更好的跃进”。为了实现这个任务，李富春副总理在报告中同时指出：1960年国民经济计划的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合，应当继续执行工业以钢为纲，农业以粮为纲，全面安排的方针等等。为了推进整个国民经济的发展，实现1960年农业生产任务，因此必须充分发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，推进农业技术改造，提高农业劳动生产率，使之适应客观发展的需要。
    各位代表，1960年的任务是艰巨和光荣的，我表示要坚决贯彻大会精神，围绕党的中心任务，积极服务，加强政治思想改造，永远听党的话，党指向哪里做到哪里，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，为完成和提前完成1960年国民经济持续跃进任务而努力奋斗！
