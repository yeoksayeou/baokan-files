Stop the Crimes of the South Vietnamese Authorities in Persecuting Former Anti-Japanese War Personnel

Commentator of this newspaper

On April 4, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, regarding the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" promulgated by the Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam and the incidents of killing and persecuting former anti-Japanese war personnel. He once again requested the International Commission to immediately instruct the South Vietnamese authorities to abolish this fascist ordinance and revoke all judgments of the Saigon "Special Military Court," and to dissolve this "court." General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out in the telegram that the Saigon "Special Military Court," established by the South Vietnamese authorities according to "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," has already sentenced twenty death penalty cases and twenty-seven hard labor cases in nine provinces of South Vietnam. While the International Commission was still considering the cases of Hoang Le Kha and Le Van Phao, this "court" actually killed them. Currently, many other former anti-Japanese war personnel and peace-loving people in South Vietnam are under the direct threat of "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" of the South Vietnamese authorities. The situation pointed out in General Vo Nguyen Giap's telegram cannot but draw serious attention. This is not only a cruel suppression of the patriotic people of South Vietnam by the South Vietnamese authorities, but also a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords, and a concrete step taken to realize the conspiracy of the United States to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a US military base and colony.

As everyone knows, the Ngo Dinh Diem group's "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" is a thorough and utter fascist ordinance. Many facts since the promulgation of this ordinance have proven that it is a tool used by the South Vietnamese authorities to kill South Vietnamese patriots, especially former anti-Japanese war personnel; and the policy on former anti-Japanese war personnel announced by the South Vietnamese authorities on August 25, 1959, openly declared that the majority of former anti-Japanese war personnel should be classified as "Viet Cong saboteurs" and should be "resolutely punished." This is a blatant act of violating the Geneva Accords. Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords clearly stipulates that no reprisals or discrimination shall be taken against any person or organization for their activities during the war, and their democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed.

The Ngo Dinh Diem group's unscrupulous killing and persecution of former anti-Japanese war personnel, despite the strong protests of the broad masses of people in both North and South Vietnam and the condemnation of just world opinion, is by no means accidental. This is inseparable from the US policy of preparing for war and creating tension in Indochina. In order to enable US imperialism to realize this conspiracy without hindrance, the Ngo Dinh Diem group actively serves its master and carries out bloody suppression of the patriotic people of South Vietnam, especially former anti-Japanese war personnel. At the same time as the Ngo Dinh Diem group is frantically persecuting the patriotic people of South Vietnam, the United States has stepped up its military activities in South Vietnam. Recently, the United States has continued to violate the provisions of the Geneva Accords, illegally shipping large quantities of war materials into South Vietnam, expanding the illegal US military institutions in South Vietnam, and strengthening the construction of military bases. According to the letter from the Liaison Representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Commission for Vietnam on March 24, the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" has recently established departments such as Psychological Warfare Department, Inspection of South Vietnamese Army Officers and Soldiers, and Management of South Vietnamese Military Food, in addition to having departments such as Air Force, Army, Navy, Training, Supervision, Logistics, and Intelligence. They even have a dedicated air force with more than 20 aircraft of various types. In addition, US officers and military personnel continue to illegally enter South Vietnam, including US Assistant Secretary of the Army Milton. On the one hand, the United States is stepping up its military expansion and war preparations in South Vietnam. On the other hand, it is also instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem army to cooperate with the Lao Royal Army in conducting "sweeps" on the Lao-Vietnamese border, cheering for the extreme pro-American reactionaries in Laos who are creating elections that violate democratic freedoms and plotting to expand the Lao civil war. From this, it can be seen that the United States is using the Ngo Dinh Diem group as its tool to destroy peace and the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and the entire Indochina. The Ngo Dinh Diem group, which betrays national interests, is bound to intensify its persecution and killing of the patriotic people of South Vietnam. The seriousness of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" lies in this.

General Vo Nguyen Giap has already made a solemn request in the telegram. In order to save the innocent victims in South Vietnam, to safeguard the implementation of the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam, and to maintain peace in Vietnam and Indochina, we believe that the International Commission, which is responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, should take swift measures to instruct the South Vietnamese authorities to abolish "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," revoke all judgments of the "Special Military Court," release all innocent victims, and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

The bloody hands of the Ngo Dinh Diem group and the American interventionists must be stopped!

    制止南越当局残害前抗战人员的罪行
    本报评论员
    4月4日，越南人民军总司令武元甲大将，就南越吴庭艳集团颁行的“59年第十号”法令和残杀、迫害前抗战人员的事件打电报给越南国际委员会主席安萨里，再次要求国际委员会立即责成南越当局取消这项法西斯法令和撤销西贡“特别军事法庭”的一切判决，并且解散这个“法庭”。武元甲大将在电报中指出，南越当局根据“59年第十号”法令建立的西贡“特别军事法庭”，已经在南越九个省流动判决了二十起死刑案件和二十七起苦役案件，而当国际委员会还在考虑黄励柯和黎文漂的案件的时候，这个“法庭”竟然把他们杀害。目前，南越许多其他前抗战人员和爱好和平的人民正在受到南越当局“59年第十号”法令的直接威胁。武元甲大将的电报所指出的情况，不能不引起人们严重的注意。这不仅是南越当局对南越爱国人民的残酷镇压，而且是它明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议、为实现美国长期分裂越南、变南越为美国的军事基地和殖民地的阴谋而采取的具体步骤。
    谁都知道，吴庭艳集团的“59年第十号”法令是一项彻头彻尾的法西斯法令。这项法令颁行以来的许多事实已经证明，它是南越当局用来杀害南越爱国者、首先是前抗战人员的工具；而南越当局在1959年8月25日公布的对前抗战人员的政策，公然宣称要把大多数前抗战人员列为“越共破坏分子”，要“坚决惩治”。这是对日内瓦协议的露骨破坏行为。日内瓦协议第十四条丙款明白规定，不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而加以任何报复和歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。
    吴庭艳集团不顾越南南北广大人民的强烈抗议和世界公正舆论的谴责，肆无忌惮地对前抗战人员进行残杀和迫害，绝非出于偶然。这是同美国在印度支那准备战争和制造紧张局势的政策分不开的。为了使美帝国主义毫无阻碍地实现这一阴谋，吴庭艳集团积极为其主子效劳，对南越爱国人民、特别是前抗战人员进行血腥镇压。就在吴庭艳集团疯狂迫害南越爱国人民的同时，美国在南越加紧了军事活动。近一个时期以来，美国继续违反日内瓦协议的规定，非法地向南越运进大批作战物资，扩充美国在南越的非法军事机构，加强军事基地的建设。据越南人民军总司令部联络代表3月24日给越南国际委员会的信中揭露，“美国军事援助顾问团”除了拥有空军、陆军、海军、训练、监察、后勤、情报等部门之外，最近还设立了心理作战部、检查南越军队官兵和管理南越军粮等部门。他们甚至还有一支拥有二十多架各种类型飞机的专用空军。此外，美国军官和军事人员不断非法进入南越，其中包括美国助理陆军部长密尔顿。美国一方面在南越加紧扩军备战活动，一方面还指使吴庭艳军队配合老挝王国军队在老越边境进行“扫荡”，为正在制造违反民主自由的选举、阴谋扩大老挝内战的老挝极端亲美反动分子打气。由此可见，美国把吴庭艳集团作为它在越南以及整个印度支那破坏和平和日内瓦协议的工具。而出卖民族利益的吴庭艳集团也就必然要变本加厉地迫害和残杀南越爱国人民。吴庭艳集团“59年第十号”法令的严重性正在于此。
    武元甲大将已在电报中提出了严正要求。为了拯救南越无辜的受害者，为了维护日内瓦协议在南越的实施、维护越南和印度支那的和平，我们认为负责监督和监察日内瓦协议在越南实施的国际委员会，应该迅速采取措施，责成南越当局取消“59年第十号”法令，撤销“特别军事法庭”的一切判决，释放一切无辜受害者，保证日内瓦协议的履行。
    必须制止吴庭艳集团和美国干涉者的血手！
