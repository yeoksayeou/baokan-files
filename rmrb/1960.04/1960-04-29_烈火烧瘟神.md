With fierce fire burning, the plague god is consumed

American imperialism has turned South Korea into a land of unprecedented hunger, poverty, and darkness, turning South Korean people into an abyss of sin where they are plunged into misery.

American imperialism, like it is everywhere else in the world, is the number one plague god. It brings only disaster, death, and tears to the South Korean people. According to incomplete statistics, since the American aggressors occupied South Korea, up to 1956, the land, buildings, vehicles, etc., they plundered amounted to US$1.25 billion, including more than 140,000 private buildings and more than 2.5 million pieces of private property. They plundered more than 100,000 hectares of farmland to expand military airfields and military highways, and build military camps. This is only what can be calculated in money. But what can be used to calculate the suffering and tears of the thousands of South Korean people, the lives of South Koreans who died under the guns and bayonets of the American and Li gangs, the more than 500,000 war widows in South Korea, and the 400,000 war orphans?

If the plague god does not leave, the South Korean people will have no freedom or happiness.

Now, a raging fire is burning. The angry tide is surging, unstoppable. South Korea is no longer a slaughterhouse where the American plague god arbitrarily exploits and slaughters it, it has become a sea of fire. This fire of struggle burned down the military and police secret service agencies of the American and Li gangs, burned down the city governments and party headquarters of those cronies, burned down the dens of traitors and executioners, burned down Li Seung-man's throne, and collapsed what American imperialism touted as "Asia's strong anti-communist fortress."

Let the fire burn even more vigorously! Burn the American plague god out of Seoul, out of Busan, out of all of South Korea!

Look, imperialism is, after all, imperialism, and the plague god is, after all, the plague god. In the face of the flames of the South Korean people's struggle, we can once again clearly see their green faces and fangs, revealing a hideous face. The "Embassy" issued a statement, threatening the South Korean people, to no avail; the Secretary of State came forward to make a speech, threatening the demonstrating masses, to no avail. As a result, State Department spokesman White openly clamored that they had a "responsibility" to "prevent unrest from developing into bloodshed," saying that the U.S. troops invading Korea "are on guard in Korea twenty-four hours a day"; as a result, representatives of more than ten countries participating in the Korean War of Aggression met under the instigation of the United States. What good can come of robbers meeting!?

However, no matter how ferocious the plague god is, it is, after all, a paper tiger. The Korean and Chinese people have already used their iron fists to expose its true colors, and the fire of anger that has been burning on South Korean soil for more than half a month has once again exposed its true colors. Li Seung-man has "disappeared," can his master have a better fate than him?

The flames of the South Korean people's struggle illuminate the path for all oppressed and enslaved people, and inspire people to use heroic and tenacious struggles to burn to death American imperialism, the greatest plague god, with determination and confidence!

    烈火烧瘟神
    郑歌
    美帝国主义把南朝鲜变成了史无前例的饥饿、贫穷和黑暗的土地，变成了使南朝鲜人民沦于水深火热的罪恶深渊。
    美帝国主义在南朝鲜，像它在世界各地一样，是头号的瘟神。它给南朝鲜人民带来的，只有灾难、死亡和眼泪。根据不完全的统计，美国侵略者占领南朝鲜以来，到1956年为止，所掠夺的土地、建筑物、车辆等等，按美元计算，就已达十二亿五千万美元，这里包括十四万多间的私人建筑物和二百五十多万件私人物资，他们掠夺了十万多顷农田扩建军用机场和军用公路，建筑军营。这只是能够用金钱计算出来的。可是，南朝鲜千万人民的痛苦和眼泪，南朝鲜死在美李匪帮的枪口和刺刀下的生命，南朝鲜五十多万的战争寡妇，四十万的战争孤儿，又能拿什么来计算呢？
    瘟神不走，南朝鲜人民就没有自由和幸福可言。
    如今，烈火熊熊地燃烧起来了。怒潮汹涌，势不可当。南朝鲜，再不是美国瘟神任意榨取、任意宰割的屠场，它成了一片大火海。这股斗争的怒火，烧掉了美李匪帮的军警特务机关，烧掉了那些狐群狗党的市政府和党部，烧掉了卖国贼、刽子手的巢穴，烧掉了李承晚的宝座，烧垮了被美帝国主义自吹为“亚洲的强大的反共堡垒”。
    烈火，燃烧得更旺盛吧！要把美国瘟神烧出汉城，烧出釜山，烧出整个南朝鲜去！
    你看，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，瘟神终究是瘟神，就在南朝鲜人民的斗争的烈火面前，我们再一次清清楚楚地看得见它们的青面獠牙，又露出一副狰狞面目。“大使馆”发表声明，对南朝鲜人民进行恫吓，无效；国务卿出马发表谈话，威胁示威的群众，无效。于是，国务院发言人怀特就公开叫嚣“有责任”来“防止不安演变为流血事件”，说侵朝美军“正在朝鲜昼夜二十四小时戒备着”；于是参加侵略朝鲜战争的十多个国家的代表，在美国纠合下开会了。强盗开会，还会有好事！？
    然而，瘟神再凶恶，毕竟也是纸老虎。朝鲜人民和中国人民已经用铁拳使它现出原形，半个多月来在南朝鲜土地上燃烧着的怒火，又一次使它原形毕露。李承晚已经“下落不明”了，他的主子难道能比他的命运更好些么？
    南朝鲜人民斗争的烈火，为一切受压迫、受奴役的人民照亮了路，鼓舞起人们用英勇顽强的斗争来烧死美帝国主义这个最大的瘟神的决心和信心！
