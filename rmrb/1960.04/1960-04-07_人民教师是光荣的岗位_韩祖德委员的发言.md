Comrades and Committee Members:

On March 29, 1960, at the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), I listened respectfully to the work report of the Standing Committee delivered by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. On March 30, I participated in the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress (NPC) and respectfully listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget." These reports greatly encouraged me, and I warmly support them and am willing to work faithfully to implement them. Now, I would like to report on what I have seen and heard recently:

All-People Learning, Comprehensive Blooming - Great Development of Education

Following the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the first spring of the 1960s, Jiangxi Province, like all fraternal provinces across the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, has launched a high tide of "good start in the first month, good every month, good every quarter, good overall, and good all the way." In particular, according to the unified national plan, Jiangxi Province is designated as one of the key provinces in the country to promote agricultural mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy for agricultural technical transformation; at the same time, it is also one of the key provinces for national industrial construction. The people of the province are jubilant, full of spirit, and soaring with enthusiasm to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

Under the brilliant light of the General Line, encouraged by the particularly good situation, and under the wise leadership and cordial care of the Party, the educational cause, which serves proletarian politics and production labor, has also shown a scene of prosperity and vibrant colors. This year, Jiangxi Province's education will be a scene of all-Party and all-people running schools, all-people learning, comprehensive blooming, great development of education, comprehensive improvement of education quality, and striving to leap into the advanced ranks of the country. Educational workers across the province, based on in-depth study, anti-Rightist inclination, boosting morale, defending the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have launched a high tide of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward." Everyone is ambitious and highly motivated, determined to run the people's education well and teach students well under the leadership of the Party.

Taking Nanchang City, where I am located, as an example, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the city, the educational cause has also shown a leap forward to meet the needs of the development of the situation. On February 7th of this year, the Nanchang City Cultural and Educational System Socialist Competition Committee convened a city-wide conference of advanced collectives and advanced workers in the cultural and educational system for 1959. A total of 369 advanced collectives and 2,002 advanced workers attended the conference, including teachers, educators, and nursery workers from universities, middle schools, and primary schools who comprehensively implement the Party's education policy and tirelessly cultivate successors to socialist and communist construction, as well as art and health workers. Under the leadership and care of the Municipal Party Committee, a large number of advanced collectives and individuals were rewarded, and everyone expressed their determination to go all out, strive for the upstream, and run the people's education cause with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Subsequently, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Nanchang Municipal Party Committee and the Nanchang City Education Bureau held on-site meetings at Jiangxiang Middle School and Gangshang Primary School in Nanchang County, respectively, which greatly encouraged all educational workers. They discussed and studied how to greatly develop the education cause, focus on improving education quality, and vowed to win the red flag and strive to be advanced. Heroic deeds, valuable experiences, and the ambition to win greater achievements encouraged everyone. One flower does not make a spring; a garden of colorful flowers is spring. The atmosphere of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping is filling the heroic city of Nanchang.

On the basis of the great popularization of school education in Nanchang City in 1958, it achieved greater development and improvement in 1959. The number of high school enrollments was 43.8% higher than the number of high school graduates, the number of junior high school enrollments was more than twice the number of junior high school graduates, and the number of private junior high school enrollments was more than six times the number of private junior high school graduates. The number of agricultural middle schools increased from three at the beginning of the year to twenty, and the number of students increased nearly six times. The number of private primary school enrollments in the city was 2.29 times higher than the number of graduating senior primary school students, and the number of private primary school enrollments was 49 times higher than the number of private senior primary school graduates. At the end of the year, the number of children in kindergartens in the city increased more than three times compared to 1958. In terms of industrial and agricultural spare-time education, there was a high tide of the whole Party mobilizing, the whole people participating, and focusing on eliminating illiteracy to run spare-time education. According to statistics at the end of last year, the number of young people participating in literacy classes accounted for 91.3% of the number of illiterate young and middle-aged people. In addition, more than 42,000 people entered spare-time primary schools, more than 14,000 people entered spare-time middle schools, and more than 2,100 people entered spare-time universities, forming a vivid situation of "everyone engaging in production and everyone studying diligently."

In particular, with the implementation of the Party's education policy, students' mental outlook has undergone great changes. Love for the Party and Chairman Mao, love for learning and labor have become a common practice, and many teachers and students have achieved triple harvests in ideology, learning, and labor.

In the glorious year of 1960, the heroic people of Nanchang City are boiling. The educational workers are the same, determined to deepen the anti-Rightist inclination under the leadership of the Party, boost morale, study, and will launch a high tide of studying Mao Zedong's works to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Teachers expressed that they will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and idealist world outlook, strengthen transformation, establish a proletarian world outlook, firmly stand on the proletarian position, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and bravely fight for the success of the people's education cause. I am deeply moved by witnessing and hearing this hot, vigorous scene and am determined to advance with the teachers under the leadership of the Party!

Anti-Rightist Inclination, Boost Morale, Hold High the Red Banner of the General Line, and Achieve a Greater Leap Forward

The school where I am located, Nanchang City Experimental Primary School, is an old school with a history of fifty-four years, but it only gained true life in the spring of 1949. In the past ten years, under the correct leadership and meticulous care of the Party and the government, it has undergone earth-shaking changes. Today, it is advancing together with the motherland.

After the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle from 1957 to 1958, the political and ideological awareness of the teaching staff in our school was greatly improved. In 1958, under the banner of the Party's General Line, a massive educational revolution movement was carried out, and the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor was conscientiously studied and resolutely implemented. The school's appearance was completely renewed, and a new situation emerged in which politics was put in command, mass movements were carried out vigorously, socialist labor competitions were launched, the spirit of communist cooperation was brought into play, teachers were fully responsible for students, and students were full of vigor and vitality, "studying hard and making progress every day."

In 1958, the continued implementation of the Party's education policy led to further improvement and development of the national education cause. Our school has also made certain achievements in improving education work. The theme of "Long Live the Three Red Banners" was used to conduct communist ideological education for students. "Supporting the Three Red Banners" and "Being a Good Child of Chairman Mao" have become the common aspirations of young children. A good atmosphere has formed among young children of distinguishing right from wrong, loving labor, studying diligently, doing good deeds for the collective, and learning from the example of pioneers. The quality of students' knowledge has also greatly improved. In terms of academic performance, students are no longer satisfied with three or four points or passing grades but are determined to strive for the upstream and strive for five points. More importantly, the ability to practically apply knowledge has been greatly enhanced. Under the guidance of teachers, students can actively think and apply book knowledge to practice, such as measuring, planting, raising animals, and carrying out various cultural and artistic activities. These are all results of improving teaching with the policy as the key.

The mental outlook of teachers has also undergone profound changes. The political atmosphere is unprecedentedly strong, and labor exercises are very active. They often use holidays to participate in urban construction voluntary labor. In teaching and education work, they also began to have a spirit of creation and innovation. Since 1958, a pilot project of a five-year primary school system has been carried out, and textbooks for the pilot project have been compiled. Every year, teaching materials for weekly meetings are compiled according to the current situation and the central work of the Party. Accumulating and summarizing bits and pieces of experience has become the teacher's self-determined labor. Last year, four volumes of education and teaching experience were compiled to offer a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Because our school strengthened the leadership of the Party, adhered to putting politics in command, and fully mobilized the masses, we have achieved some small achievements in our work and have been rewarded by the province, city, and district many times. This year, we won the title of Red Flag School of the city and district, which has further stimulated the enthusiasm of teachers and staff to strive for the upstream. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued a notice that a national conference of heroes on the cultural and educational front will be held in June this year. This is an exciting piece of good news that greatly encourages the work enthusiasm of teachers and staff. Teachers and staff unanimously recognize that this is the Party's attention and care for the cultural and educational front and the glory of cultural and educational workers. As soon as the good news arrived, a high tide of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, improving work, and improving the quality of work was immediately set off. Everyone strives to use more and more outstanding achievements to welcome the convening of this conference of representatives, and "offering gifts to Beijing" has become the ambition of every teacher and staff member. This great happy event has a great encouraging effect on promoting the great development and great improvement on the cultural and educational front in 1960 and will also enable our school to leap forward faster and better and make more achievements to report to the Party.

Faithfully Listen to the Words of the Party and Chairman Mao and Resolutely Take the Socialist Road

I am seventy-nine years old this year, have experienced several dynasties, have been teaching in primary schools all along, and have suffered oppression and pain in the old society, living a life of not having enough to eat or wear. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I, like the people of the whole country, was liberated. The Party and the government have shown meticulous care for our teaching, given us honor in politics, taken care of us in life, and provided meticulous help in our work. After liberation, I became the principal of Nanchang City Experimental Primary School and was elected as a representative of the people of the district, county, and province, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, and the Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, a member of the National Education Union, the Provincial Education Union, and the Municipal Education Union. This is entirely a manifestation of the Party's attention and care for the people's teachers. This glory should be attributed to the Party and the majority of teachers. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, I feel that being a people's teacher is supremely glorious. The Party and the people have given us a more important and glorious task, which is to cultivate the new generation of the motherland into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Although I am old, I am not willing to admit that I am old. I want to live younger and younger. I want to do it for another ten years, twenty years, or even eighty years. I am determined to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, transform myself, improve myself, and bravely advance holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    人民教师是光荣的岗位
    韩祖德委员的发言各位委员：
    1960年3月29日，在全国政协三届二次会议上恭听了陈叔通副主席作的常务委员会的工作报告。3月30日参加了人大二届二次会议，又恭听到李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告”。这些报告对我鼓舞很大，我热烈地拥护，并愿忠诚为贯彻这些报告而努力。兹就我平日的所见所闻作一汇报：
    全民学习，全面开花  教育事业大发展
    继1958年和1959年连续大跃进后，六十年代第一个春天，江西省和全国各兄弟省一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在省委和省人委的直接领导下，掀起了一个“开门红、月月红、季季红、全面红、红到底”的高潮。特别是根据国家的统一计划，江西省列为全国推行农业机械化，电气化，水利化的农业技术改造的重点省份之一；同时又是国家工业建设的重点省份之一。全省人民欢欣鼓舞，意气风发，干劲冲天，为实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，在特别好的形势鼓舞下，在党的英明领导和亲切关怀下，作为服务于无产阶级政治，服务于生产劳动的教育事业，也出现了一片欣欣向荣，万紫千红的景象。在今年，江西省的教育事业将是一个全党全民办学，全民学习，全面开花，教育事业大发展，全面地提高教育质量，力争跃进全国先进行列的局面。全省教育工作者在深入学习反右倾、鼓干劲、保卫总路线、大跃进和人民公社的基础上，掀起了一个“学先进，比先进，赶先进，帮后进”的高潮，大家雄心勃勃，干劲很大，决心在党的领导下，办好人民教育事业，教好学生。
    就以我所在的南昌市来说，随着全市工农业生产的大跃进，教育事业为适应形势发展的需要，也出现了一个跃进的局面。今年2月7日，南昌市文教系统社会主义竞赛委员会召开了全市文教系统1959年度先进集体、先进工作者大会。出席这次大会的共有三百六十九个先进集体和二千零二名先进工作者。其中有全面贯彻党的教育方针，孜孜不倦地培养社会主义、共产主义建设接班人的大、中、小学教员和教育员，保育员，有艺术、卫生工作者。在市委的领导关怀下，奖励了大批先进集体和个人，大家表示要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地办好人民教育事业。随后，中共南昌市委文教部、南昌市教育局又在蒋巷中学、南昌县冈上小学分别召开了现场会议，更大地鼓舞了全体教育工作者，他们纷纷讨论、研究如何大发展教育事业，狠抓提高教育质量，誓夺红旗，争先进。英雄的事迹，宝贵的经验，夺取更大的雄心壮志，鼓舞着大家，一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春，比、学、赶、帮的气氛充满了英雄的南昌城。
    南昌市学校教育在1958年大普及的基础上，1959年又有了大发展，大提高。高中招生人数比高中毕业生人数多43.8％，初中招生人数比初中毕业生人数多两倍多，民办初中招生人数比民办初中毕业生人数多六倍多，农业中学由年初的三所发展到二十所，学生人数增长近六倍。全市民办小学招生人数与应届高小毕业生人数比较，多二点二九倍，民办小学招生人数与民办高小毕业生人数比较，多四十九倍，年末全市幼儿园的儿童人数比1958年增长三倍多。在工农业余教育方面，出现了全党动员，全民动手，以扫盲为中心的大办业余教育的高潮。到去年年底统计，全市参加扫盲班学习的青年占青壮年文盲数的91.3％。此外，尚有四万二千多人入业余小学，一万四千多人入业余中学，二千一百多人入业余大学，形成了一个“人人搞生产，个个勤学习”的生动局面。
    特别是贯彻了党的教育工作方针，学生的精神面貌起了很大的变化。热爱党和毛主席，热爱学习和劳动已蔚然成风，许多学校师生获得思想、学习、劳动三丰收。
    在光辉的1960年，英雄的南昌市人民沸腾起来了。教育工作者也一样，决心在党的领导下，深入反右倾，鼓干劲学习，并将掀起一个学习毛泽东著作的高潮，用毛泽东思想来武装自己。教师表示要高举毛泽东思想红旗，开展与形形色色的资产阶级思想、唯心主义世界观的斗争，加强改造，树立无产阶级的世界观，站稳无产阶级的立场，听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，为办好人民教育事业而英勇奋斗。我目睹耳闻这一热气腾腾，生龙活虎的景象，深为感动，决心在党的领导下，和教师们一道前进！
    反右倾，鼓干劲，高举总路线红旗，实现更大的跃进
    我所在的学校，南昌市实验小学，是一所有五十四年历史的古老的学校，但她只是在1949年的春天，才获得真正的生命。十年来在党和政府的正确领导与无微不至的关怀下，她经历着翻天复地的变化，今天，她在和祖国一同前进。
    我校经过1957年到1958年的整风反右斗争，教工同志的政治思想觉悟大大提高。1958年，在党的总路线的旗帜下，开展了声势浩大的教育革命运动，认真学习并坚决贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。学校的面貌焕然一新，出现了坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，发挥共产主义协作精神，教师对学生全面负责，学生“好好学习，天天向上”的朝气蓬勃的新局面。
    1958年继续贯彻执行党的教育方针，全国教育事业又有了进一步的提高和发展。我校在改进教育工作方面，也取得了一定的成绩，以“三面红旗万万岁”为主题向学生进行共产主义思想教育，“拥护三面红旗”，“做毛主席的好孩子”，已成为少年儿童的共同意愿。在少年儿童中形成了明辨大是大非，热爱劳动，勤勉学习，为集体做好事，学习先锋的榜样的好风气。学生的知识质量也有很大提高。从学习成绩来说，学生已不满足于三分四分或及格，都有力争上游，争取五分的志气。更重要的是实际运用知识的能力大大增强。学生在教师辅导下能积极思维，能将书本知识运用于实际，如测量、种植、饲养、开展各种文艺活动。这些，都是以方针为纲改进教学的结果。
    教师们精神面貌也起着深刻的变化，政治空气空前浓厚，劳动锻炼非常积极，经常利用假日参加城市建设义务劳动。在教学教育工作上，也开始有创造革新的精神。1958年起，进行了小学五年制试点工作，并且自编了试点用的教材。每年都能根据当前形势与党的中心工作编写周会教材。积累总结点滴经验已成为教师的自定劳动，去年汇集了教育与教学经验四册，向建国十周年献礼。
    由于我校加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动了群众，工作上取得了一些微小成绩，多次受到省、市、区的奖赏。今年获得了市、区的红旗校称号，更加激发教工争上游的积极性。中共中央、国务院发出通知，今年6月将举行全国文教战线群英大会，这是一个振奋人心的喜讯，大大鼓舞了教工们的工作热情。教工们一致认识到这是党对文教战线的重视和关怀，是文教工作者的光荣。喜讯一到，立即掀起了学先进，赶先进，改进工作，提高工作质量的热潮，都争取用更多的，更卓越的成就，迎接这次代表大会的召开，“献礼进京”成为每个教工的雄心壮志。这件大喜事对促进1960年文教战线上发展大普及和大提高起着极大的鼓舞作用，也将使我校跃进更快、更好，作出更多的成绩向党汇报。
    忠诚地听党和毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义的道路
    我今年七十九岁了，经历过好几个朝代，一直教小学，做小学教员，在旧社会受尽了压迫和痛苦，过着食不满肚，衣不暖身的生活。解放后，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我和全国人民一样，得到了解放。党和政府对我们教学无微不至地关怀，在政治上给了我们荣誉，在生活上给了我们照顾，在工作上更是体贴入微的帮助。我在解放后当上南昌市实验小学校长，被选为区、县、省人民代表，全国政协、省政协、市政协委员，全国教育工会、省教育工会、市教育工会委员，这完全是党的重视和关怀人民教师的表现，这光荣应归功于党和广大教师，在这大跃进的时代里，我感到做一个人民教师是无尚光荣的，党和人民交给了我们更重大的光荣任务，就是培养祖国新生一代成为具有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。我虽然老了。但我不服老，我要越活越年青，我要再干它十年，二十年，甚至八十年。决心认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，改造自己，提高自己，高举毛泽东思想红旗奋勇前进！
