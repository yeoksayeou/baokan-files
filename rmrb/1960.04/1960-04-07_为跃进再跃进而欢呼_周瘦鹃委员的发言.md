I wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC. Listening to these reports is like hearing magnificent bugle calls and gorgeous epics. I can't help but dance with joy, cheering for this year's Great Leap Forward to leap forward again.

The unforgettable 1958 set off a high tide of the all-round Great Leap Forward. The Party's compass guided us, and the lighthouse of the General Line illuminated us, as we sang and marched forward towards the bright road of socialism at a tremendous pace. The worker and peasant brothers, holding high the three red flags, ran ahead like flying, throwing Father Time far behind, unable to keep up. In 1959, the leap forward continued, creating countless amazing achievements. In capitalist countries, such miracles would only appear in "Arabian Nights"-style fairy tales.

The Laboring People Become the Masters of Suzhou City

I come from Suzhou, so let me talk about Suzhou. Suzhou is a land of plenty with mild mountains and soft waters, always mentioned together with Hangzhou, as the saying goes, "In heaven there is paradise, on earth there are Suzhou and Hangzhou," thus earning the beautiful name of a paradise on earth. In fact, before liberation, there was no image of paradise. If you insisted on calling it paradise, it was only a paradise for bureaucrats and landlords, a paradise for capitalists and the leisure class, while the poor laboring people were not in paradise, but were knocked down into hell. In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party, Suzhou has been renewing itself year by year, striving to build itself, and only then has it looked more and more like a paradise. The laboring people have also ascended from hell to paradise. Those bureaucrats and landlords have all been overthrown, and capitalists and the leisure class, after being reformed, have also become self-reliant laborers. In the past, Suzhou people often liked to talk empty words and put on empty airs, so they had a nickname of "Su Empty Head"; but now, the empty heads have undergone various tests, incorporated the spirit of patriotism and socialist ideology, and gradually become full. The empty heads are no longer empty. In the past, housewives were mostly delicate and weak, but now, they have also changed with this great era, changed, the pliant softness has become tempered steel. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, they have taken the lead in transport work in voluntary labor, carrying burdens and pushing carts, walking vigorously, showing full enthusiasm. Even their children have changed with this great era, changed, worthy of being children of the Mao Zedong era. For example, in Jin Chang District, 108 Young Pioneers vigorously engaged in iron smelting and patriotic sanitation campaigns, achieving remarkable results, and everyone called them the 108 Heroes. These children are the new force for building socialism, and they will definitely make greater contributions to the future of Suzhou.

When everyone arrives in Suzhou, they always remember the gardens of Suzhou. According to surveys, there are more than 170 gardens of all sizes in the city, laying a foundation for a garden city. As for the few gardens that have been opened, there are the Canglang Pavilion from the Song Dynasty, the Lion Grove from the Yuan Dynasty, the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Master of the Nets Garden from the Ming Dynasty, and the Lingering Garden and the Yiyuan Garden from the Qing Dynasty, each with its own style and characteristics, undoubtedly all artistic crystallizations full of poetry and painting. In recent years, they have become paradises loved by laboring people from all over the country, with more than 7.4 million visitors; and nearly 40 countries of international friends who have come from afar to visit have also given high evaluations. If Suzhou is said to be a paradise, then these gardens can be said to be the jade gardens and yao orchards in paradise. In the past year, more attention has been paid to large-scale greening. Tiger Hill has been expanded from the front hill to the back hill and will be built into a huge park. There are also plans to vigorously renovate Shihu Lake, making it a grand park with beautiful mountains and rivers and blooming flowers and fruits. Speaking of the gardens of Suzhou, we must also think of the penjing of Suzhou; since my image and some of the penjing from the Humble Administrator's Garden appeared on the screen, it has aroused more attention at home and abroad. In the past year, the garden management office has worked hard to cultivate and has increased to tens of thousands of pots, and it is also leaping forward day by day. Comrade Zhu Zian, a penjing technician at the Humble Administrator's Garden, gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes, and his enthusiasm has been even greater since his return. Garden workers from all over the country have come to Suzhou to learn the making of penjing, which has spread to Hangzhou, Hefei, Wuhan, Shenyang, Nanchang, Guilin, Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Xuzhou, Jinan, and other places. Some have completed their studies and returned, and some are still continuing to study. In the future, there will be penjing in gardens all over the country, which can enrich the cultural life of the people. This is truly "a riot of color makes spring."

Transformed from a Consumer City into an Industrial City

If everyone looks at Suzhou with old eyes, thinking that Suzhou is just a consumer city for eating, drinking, and wandering around; thinking that Suzhou is just a place of production for embroidery, opera costumes, huqin, sandalwood fans, and other handicrafts, then you would underestimate the current Suzhou, because Suzhou, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, with leaps forward again and again, has also leaped to become a brand new industrial city. Among the red, green, lush, and verdant gardens and flowers, stand rows of factory chimneys, and there are more than 30 large factories with more than a thousand workers, not to mention the smaller ones. Recently, 23 red flag units of industrial production in the city were selected in 1959, such as the Suzhou Carbon Black Factory, the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the Dongfeng Coking Plant, all of which were built from scratch through the heroic and moving hard work of the heroes. In addition, the Xujiang Iron and Steel Plant, the Suzhou Iron and Steel Plant, and the Suzhou Iron Factory have all established a certain scale of the iron and steel industry. The raging fire in the blast furnace burns red half of the sky, and the rolling hot steel and iron are flowing day and night. The electromechanical industry had only more than 100 dilapidated machine tools ten years ago, which was pitifully scarce. Now it has developed to nearly 2,000 units, producing some relatively precise products. The chemical industry could only produce ordinary products such as red mercury ten years ago, but now it can produce basic chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid and cutting-edge products such as nylon and organic glass; and a new modern sulfuric acid plant has been built and put into production. There is also a miracle: Suzhou City has produced a large number of various telecommunications, meters, and instruments in the past year, not only supplying the city, but also supporting 34 provinces and cities, and selling to countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Iraq, Vietnam, and North Korea. Therefore, it has established ambitious goals, and during the last three years of the second five-year plan, it will establish an industrial city with the ability to manufacture complete sets of instruments, precision control instruments, and advanced telecommunications equipment. The worker brothers and sisters in the city's factories are all high-spirited and enthusiastic, carrying out technical innovations every day, marching towards electrification and mechanization, and almost everyone has become an innovation enthusiast. The total industrial output value in 1959 increased eightfold compared to ten years ago, and the industrial output value target of Suzhou City in the second five-year plan stipulated by the state was completed ahead of schedule in 1959. The rural areas in the suburbs have also greatly improved production due to the realization of the people's communes. The yield of rice per mu increased by 56%, the production of wheat increased by 123%, and the production of other non-staple foods is also continuing to increase. Under the situation of this leap forward again and again and continuous leap forward, Suzhou's infinitely beautiful and splendid future has been presented before our eyes like a picture, and Suzhou is worthy of being a paradise on earth.

Talents Emerge in the Party's Attention and Cultivation

Suzhou is leaping forward again and again, so what should we old intellectuals who are staying in Suzhou do? Everyone is shouting: "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." Can we turn a deaf ear and stand idly by? I am a little old man of sixty-six years old. Although I am old, I have never accepted old age. I think the motherland is already young, and I am of course young. I must catch up with this great era and not fall behind like an old ox pulling a broken cart. I am neither a worker nor a farmer, so how can I express a leap forward? My daily work is also like walking on two legs, one leg is literature and art, and the other leg is gardening. In order to respond to the call of the all-round Great Leap Forward, both legs are energized and running forward non-stop. Gardening during the day and literature and art at night. Whether it works or not, do some is some, that is, take a step forward is a step.

I remember last April, I was honored to be invited to attend the National Committee of the CPPCC and attend the National People's Congress as a non-voting delegate, which was equivalent to taking two major socialist lessons, and I also saw our great leader Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou and talked with them; my heart was firmly tied to the Huai Ren Hall, even to this day. What I will never forget in my life is that Chairman Mao once kindly stretched out his hand and asked me: "Do you have anything new to show me?" This sentence played a great role in encouraging and urging me, and it was also like a bugle call for a leap forward again and again. After I returned to Suzhou, Chairman Mao's words kept echoing in my ears, and Chairman Mao's hand kept shaking in front of my eyes. So my enthusiasm came, my body was full of energy, even if my eyesight was not good, I still fought at night with the lights on and wrote a lot of articles in a row; I got up at dawn during the day and made a lot of picturesque penjing in a row, I was simply happy and forgot fatigue; the only purpose was to create more new things to show Chairman Mao and everyone. At the end of the prose "My Heart is Tied to Huai Ren Hall", I also wrote a poem to express my determination: "The days of Yao and Shun are clearly visible, and it is hard to forget a piece of affection; I am willing to dedicate this body to the country for a long time, and I will not be afraid to cherish the rest of my life." I think Chairman Mao's words were not only addressed to me personally, but also to every person in the country. We should all leap forward again and again in our different positions, create more new things to show that under his old man's guidance, we have gone all out to aim high.

In order to create some new things, I thought hard every day, almost getting into a dead end. Finally, on a very hot day last summer, I did something bold and reckless, that is, I respectfully rhymed with the four poems and seventeen lyrics that Chairman Mao had published in newspapers and periodicals one by one. Some of the rhymes in Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics are really not easy to rhyme with; I used my brains a lot, racked my brains, and thought hard, thought about it early and thought about it at night; finally, after a week of effort, I broke through one pass after another and actually rhymed with all of them. Every poem or lyric no longer dares to chant about the wind and moon in the old way, but praises the new society and new things. I know that my skills are weak, and I don't deeply understand the thoughts and feelings in Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, but it shows my spirit of hard work, clumsy work, dare to do and dare to be.

As everyone knows, Suzhou is an ancient cultural city with a particularly large number of scholars. In the Qing Dynasty, it was said to be the birthplace of top scholars and prime ministers. Now, there are still many poets and learned people. In the Qing Dynasty, they were either Jinshi, Juren, or Gongsheng Xiucai. They could write an eight-legged essay or a test poem with a wave of their pens. But in this era of the Great Leap Forward, they have also changed, changed, and become old and young people in the new China. Several of them, although they are old, are still serving the heavy industry and light industry, contributing their opinions at any time; some still go to the municipal CPPCC on a fixed day and time to participate in political studies, tirelessly study Marxism-Leninism, and occasionally write a poem or fill in a lyric, no longer moaning without illness, but praising new people and new things, praising the new life of the motherland. Some often go to factories and villages to visit; some compile literature and history and sort out classical literature, and some participate in cultural relic preservation work. The enthusiasm of these old people is really no less than that of young guys. As for the traditional Chinese painters who use lead and powder to paint, there are also a particularly large number in Suzhou. In the past ten years, under the attention and cultivation of the Party, even more talents have emerged. The older generation of painters used to serve only bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists, focusing on business, but now, they have also changed with this great era, changed, and become brilliant hands in painting the new things of the new China. They no longer create empty things in the painting studio, they often go out to experience life, sketch on the spot, and even shout the slogan that painting flowers and birds must also have a sense of the times. Several old painters are drawing designs in embroidery factories, sandalwood fan factories, and art and craft factories, working hard all day long to serve production. Don't think they are all old, but they are still speeding up their horses and striving to leap forward. Every old person is full of vitality and has absolutely no twilight thoughts. I myself am not old, not young, my zodiac sign is the sheep, of course I won't be like an ox. The sheep will also leap, but it doesn't leap far. Fortunately, it has two horns, which are weapons of struggle. I want to use one horn to fight against right-leaning opportunism and one horn to fight against the bourgeois world outlook. I must win the final victory.

To Become a Red Old Man

Although I cannot follow the pace of the worker and peasant brothers in the Great Leap Forward, leaping forward again and again, due to age and physical strength. However, my mind is not made of granite, nor is it like an old and obsolete machine; I still want to strive for a leap forward in thought, a leap forward in politics, to overcome the small self with the big self, to replace the old self with the new self, to establish a communist style, to arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, to transform myself thoroughly, and to become a completely and unreservedly red old man. Even if my light, heat, and strength are all weak, I still want to emit the remaining light of a torch, the slight heat of the remaining ashes, and some of the strength left over from my youth, to contribute to socialist construction, to play the role of the smallest screw; and I hope to double my current age and live to be one hundred and thirty-two years old, to see the realization of the communist new China. Don't think that I am ambitious, in fact, we are growing up in this great era, feeling happy, healthy, living to be one or two hundred years old is not uncommon at all. There are many old people over a hundred years old in the Soviet Union, who are still old and strong. I predict that many old committee members here who are seventy or eighty years old can live to this age, maybe even exceed it, truly immortal, pine and cypress evergreen; when that time comes, we will gather together to hold a longevity celebration, okay? Finally, I want to read a poem of "Qinyuan Spring" praising the Great Leap Forward, which is one of the poems and lyrics that I rhymed with Chairman Mao's great work last summer, please give me more advice:

"Splendid mountains and rivers, hundreds of millions follow, the red flag flutters in the wind. Look at the majestic pass in the north, the yellow dust is vast, the great river flows east, the white waves are surging. Mines are rich in five metals, fields are rich in five grains, and production has been increasing year by year. It is truly lovable, love the thousands of reds and purples, competing to be charming. The singing is equally charming, and the phoenixes fly and the luan dance to try their waists. Moreover, the articles are vigorous, no less than the historical records, and the poems and lyrics are unrestrained, not counting the Lisao. Thousands of athletes, dragons soaring and tigers leaping, striving to cut down dragons and shoot eagles. Deeply wish, wish the Soviet Union today, that is my tomorrow."

### 为跃进再跃进而欢呼  周瘦鹃委员的发言

专栏：

    为跃进再跃进而欢呼
    周瘦鹃委员的发言
    我竭诚拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告、陈叔通副主席全国政协常务委员会工作的报告；听了这些报告，好像是听到一声声雄壮的号角，一首首瑰丽的史诗，我也不由得手舞足蹈地为这一年来的跃进再跃进而欢呼。
    难忘的1958年，掀起了全面大跃进的高潮，党的罗盘指引着我们，总路线的灯塔照耀着我们，齐向着社会主义的光明大道高歌猛进，一日千里；工农弟兄高举着三面红旗，如飞一般的跑在前头，直把时间老人也远远地抛在后面，跟不上来。1959年继续跃进，更创造了无量数的惊人成就，要是资本主义国家，除非是在“天方夜谭”式的神话里，才会出现这样的奇迹。
    劳动人民成了苏州城的主人
    我从苏州来，且谈苏州事：苏州是个山温水软的鱼米之乡，一向和杭州并称，所谓上有天堂，下有苏杭，因此获得了一个人间天堂的美名。其实在解放以前，并没有什么天堂的形象，如果硬说它是天堂，那也不过是官僚和地主的天堂，是资本家和有闲阶级的天堂，而一般可怜的劳动人民，却并不是在天堂上，而是打落在地狱里的。建国十年以来，苏州在党的英明领导之下，一年年的革故鼎新，努力建设，这才一年年的像了个天堂模样，而劳动人民也从地狱里超升到天堂上来了。那些官僚地主全被打倒，资本家和有闲阶级经过改造，也变成了自食其力的劳动者。从前苏州人往往喜欢说空话，摆空架子，所以曾有一个“苏空头”的浑号；而现在呢，空头经过了种种考验，纳入爱国主义精神和社会主义思想，渐渐地充实起来，空头不空了。从前的家庭妇女，多半是娇滴滴地弱不禁风的，而现在呢，她们也已跟着这大时代变了，变了，绕指柔变做了百炼钢。尤其是从大跃进以来，她们在义务劳动中争先担任运输工作，肩挑车运，健步如飞，表现了十足的干劲。连她们的子女也跟着这大时代变了，变了，不愧为毛泽东时代的儿童；例如金阊区曾有少先队员一百零八人，大搞炼铁和爱国卫生运动，成绩卓著，大家称他们为一百零八将。像这样的小朋友们，就是建设社会主义的新生力量，对于未来的苏州一定会有更大的贡献。
    大家到了苏州，总忘不了苏州的园林，据调查所得，全市大大小小的园子，多至一百七十余处，打下了一个构成花园城市的基础。就已开放的几个园子来说，有宋代的沧浪亭、元代的狮子林、明代的拙政园、网师园、清代的留园、怡园，各有各的风格，各有各的特点，无疑地都是富有诗情画意的艺术结晶品。这些年来，已成为各地劳动人民爱好的乐园，前去游览的，多至七百四十余万人次；而不远万里而来登门参观的国际友人，也已有近四十个国家，都给予很高的评价。如果说苏州是天堂，那么这些园林，可就是天堂上的琼苑瑶圃了。一年以来，更注意于大面积绿化，虎丘已从前山拓展到后山，将辟作一个绝大的公园；还打算大力整理石湖，成为一个山水明秀花果烂漫的大公园。说起了苏州的园林，又得联想到苏州的盆景；自从我和拙政园的一部分盆景映上了银幕以后，更引起了国内外的注意。这一年来，园林管理处努力培植已增加到几万盆，也在一天天的跃进。拙政园的盆景技工朱子安同志，光荣地出席了全国群英大会，回来后干劲更足了。全国各地的园林工作者纷纷到苏州来学习盆景的制作，已遍及杭州、合肥、武汉、沈阳、南昌、桂林、北京、天津、西安、徐州、济南各处，有的已学成回去，有的还在继续学习，将来全国各地的园林中都有盆景，可以丰富人民的文化生活，这真是“万紫千红才是春”了。
    由消费城市变成了工业城市
    大家要是把旧眼光来看苏州，以为苏州不过是一个吃吃喝喝游游荡荡的消费城市；以为苏州不过是一个绣货、戏衣、胡琴、檀香扇等手工艺品的产地，那么您就小觑了现在的苏州，因为苏州从1958年大跃进以来，跃进再跃进，也已一跃而为崭新的工业城市了。在那红红绿绿郁郁葱葱的园林花木之间，矗起了林林总总的工厂大烟囱，拥有工人千人以上的大工厂已有三十多个，较小的更不计其数，最近评出了1959年全市工业生产红旗单位二十三个，其中如苏州炭黑厂，苏州农业药械厂，东风焦化厂，都是经过了英雄们可歌可泣的艰苦奋斗，从无到有，白手成家的。此外如胥江钢铁厂、苏州钢铁厂、苏州铁工厂，都建立有一定规模的钢铁工业，高炉中的熊熊烈火，烧红了半爿天，热浪滚滚的钢水铁水，正在日夜的奔流着。机电工业在十年前只有一百多台破破烂烂的机床，贫乏得可怜，现在已发展到近二千台，生产一些比较精密的产品。化学工业在十年前只能生产红汞等普通产品，而现在已能生产硫酸、盐酸等基本化学原料和尼龙、有机玻璃等尖端产品；并且新建了一座现代化的硫酸厂投入生产。更有一个奇迹，苏州市一年来大批生产了各种电讯、仪表、仪器，不但供应本市，还支援了三十四个省、市，并且销售到德意志民主共和国、伊拉克、越南、朝鲜等国家。因此立下了雄心壮志，在第二个五年计划的后三年期间，将建立起一个具有制造成套仪表、精密控制仪器及高级电讯器材的工业城市。全市工厂中的工人弟兄姊妹们，都是意气风发，干劲冲天，天天都在搞技术革新，向电动化、机械化进军，几乎人人都成了革新迷。1959年的工业总产值，比十年前增长了八倍，国家规定苏州市第二个五年计划的工业产值指标，已在1959年内提前完成。郊区农村也因实现了人民公社化，生产大大提高，水稻亩产增长了56％，小麦生产增长了123％，其他副食品生产也在继续增高中。在这跃进再跃进不断跃进的形势之下，苏州一片无穷美好的锦绣前程，已像图画般展现在我们的眼前，苏州这才无愧于是一个人间的天堂。
    在党的重视和培养之下人材辈出
    苏州正在跃进再跃进，我们这些耽在苏州的老年知识分子，又待怎样呢？大家正在高呼着：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”，我们难道可以充耳不闻，袖手旁观吗？我是一个六十六岁的小老头儿，老虽老，而一向是不服老的，以为祖国已年轻了，我也当然年轻了；我一定要跟着大时代追赶上去，不许像老牛破车一般，落在后面。我不是工，也不是农，要怎样才能表示跃进呢？我的日常工作也好像是两条腿走路，一条腿是文艺，一条腿是园艺；为了响应全面大跃进的号召，两条腿都鼓起劲来，不停地向前跑去。白天搞园艺，晚上搞文艺。不管行不行，做一些是一些，也就是跃进一步是一步。
    记得去年4月，我荣幸地被邀出席全国政协会议、列席全国人民代表大会，等于上了两堂社会主义大课，并且见到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席和周总理，又谈了话；我的心就牢牢地拴住在怀仁堂，以至于今。尤其使我一辈子忘不了的，毛主席曾经亲切地伸着手问我：“有什么新的东西给我看看？”这一句话，对我起了莫大鼓励和督促的作用，也等于是一声跃进再跃进的号角。我回到苏州以后，毛主席的话老是在我的耳边荡漾着，毛主席的手老是在我的眼前晃动着。于是我的干劲来了，活力满身，即使目力不济，还是挑灯夜战，一连写了好多篇文章；白天黎明即起，一连做了不少富有画意的盆景，简直是乐而忘倦；目的只有一个，就是要多搞些新东西出来，给毛主席看看，也好给大家看看。在那“我的心拴住在怀仁堂”一篇散文的结尾。还写了一首诗，表示我的决心：“尧天舜日分明见，刻骨难忘一片情；愿把此身长许国，辛勤宁复惜余生。”我以为毛主席的那句话，不单是对我个人说，也可以说是对全国每一个人民说的。我们都应该在各个不同的岗位上，跃进跃进再跃进，多搞一些新的东西出来，表示我们在他老人家的教导之下，为力争上游而鼓足了干劲。
    为了要搞些新东西出来，天天穷思极想，几乎钻到了牛角尖里去。终于在去年夏季一个大热天里，干了一件胆大妄为的事情，就是把毛主席在报刊上发表过的四首诗和十七首词一一步韵恭和。毛主席诗词中有些韵脚实在是不容易和的；我大动脑筋，绞尽脑汁，苦苦地想，早也想，夜也想；终于费了一星期的工夫，破了一关又一关，居然全部和出来了。每一首诗或词，再也不敢老一套的吟风弄月，都是歌颂新社会新事物的。自知工力既薄弱，对毛主席诗词中的思想感情也体会不深，不过表示我的一番苦干笨干敢作敢为的精神罢了。
    大家知道苏州是个文化古城，读书人特别多，在前清时代，据说是状元宰相的产地。到了现在，还有不少诗人词客和饱学之士，在前清不是进士举人，便是贡生秀才，要他们写一篇八股文或试帖诗，还可以摇笔即来。可是在这大跃进的时代，他们也跟着变了，变了，变做了新中国的老少年。有几位虽已年登髦?，还在对重工业和轻工业效劳，随时贡献意见；有的还在定日定时的到市政协去参加时政学习，孜孜不倦地研究马克思列宁主义，偶然作一首诗填一首词，不再是无病而呻，而是歌颂新人新事，歌颂祖国的新生。有的经常下厂下乡去参观；有的编写文史和整理古典文学，有的参加文物保管工作。这许多老年人的干劲，实在不输于年轻小伙子。至于调铅杀粉的国画家，苏州也特别多，十年来在党的重视和培养之下，更是人才辈出。老一辈的画家，从前只是为官僚、地主、资本家服务，着重在生意眼，而现在呢，也跟着大时代变了，变了，变做了描绘新中国新事物的丹青妙手。他们不再在画室里向壁虚造，经常的出去体验生活，实地写生，甚至喊出画花鸟也要有时代性的口号。有几位老画师，都在刺绣工场、檀香扇厂和美术工艺厂绘图设计，整日的埋头苦干，为生产服务。别以为他们都已老了，可是还在快马加鞭，努力跃进，每一个老年人，都充满着活力，绝对没有黄昏思想。我自己说老不老，说小不小，生肖属羊，当然不会牛步化，羊也会跃，只是跃得不远。好在它有两只角，倒是斗争的武器，我要把一只角向右倾机会主义斗争，把一只角向资产阶级世界观斗争，非取得最后胜利不可。
    要成为一个红色的老人
    我虽然由于年龄和体力的关系，在工作上不能跟着工农弟兄大跃进的步伐，跃进再跃进。然而我的头脑并不是花岗石做的，也不像是破旧而报废的老机器；我还是要争取思想上的跃进，政治上的跃进，以大我战胜小我，以新我代替旧我，树立共产主义风格，用毛泽东思想武装自己，要脱胎换骨地改造自己，成为一个十十足足不折不扣的红色老人。不管我的光、热、力都已差了，我还是要发出爝火余光，残灰微热，和少壮时代剩下来的一些力，贡献于社会主义建设，起一个最小的螺丝钉的作用；并且希望把我现在的年龄翻一番，活到一百三十二岁，看到共产主义新中国的实现。大家不要以为我是野心勃勃，其实我们生长在这个大时代里，心情愉快，身体健康，活到一二百岁，一点也不稀奇，苏联就有不少一百多岁的老寿星，还是老而弥健。我预料这里有许多七八十岁的老委员，都可活到这个年龄，也许还要超额，真是长生不老，松柏常青；到那个时候，我们一起集合起来，举行一个万岁祝寿大会，好不好？末了我要念一首歌颂大跃进的沁园春词，就是去夏所和毛主席大作诗词中的一首，请各位委员多多指教：
    “锦绣山河，亿众云从，赤帜风飘。看雄关北峙，黄尘漠漠，大江东去，白浪滔滔。矿富五金，田丰五谷，生产年来节节高。真堪爱，爱千红万紫，竞比嫽娆。声歌一样多娇，更凤翥鸾翔试舞腰。况文章波磔，何输史记，诗词奔放，不数离骚。千百健儿，龙腾虎跃，奋去斩蛟复射雕。深深祝，祝苏联今日，即我明朝。”
