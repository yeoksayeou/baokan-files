Comrades, Mr. Chairman, fellow representatives:
I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

In 1959, on the basis of the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people adhered to the general line of socialist construction, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, adhered to the people's communes, and launched a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. Especially under the great call and inspiration of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, the people of the whole country were high-spirited and in high spirits, and overfulfilled the 1959 national economic plan, completing the main targets set in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the Chinese people, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese revolution and construction.

In 1959, China's water conservancy and hydropower construction undertakings, like other construction undertakings in the country, also achieved great achievements. In terms of water conservancy construction, 1959 was the year with the most serious natural disasters in my country since liberation. The disaster-stricken area reached 650 million mu, accounting for 30% of the total sown area. In most parts of eight provinces, it did not rain continuously for three or four months in summer, causing nearly 400 million mu of farmland to suffer severe disasters. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, thanks to the full play of the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, a high tide of water conservancy construction was set off, the vast number of commune members were effectively organized to fight against disasters, and countless large, medium and small water conservancy projects were built, finally overcoming the natural disasters, winning the bumper harvest of agriculture, and realizing the continued Great Leap Forward in agriculture. From October 1958 to September 1959, a total of 13 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, and the newly added irrigation area reached 70 million mu, and a large number of existing water conservancy irrigation systems were improved. From the winter of 1959 to the spring of 1960, a larger-scale high tide of water conservancy construction has been vigorously launched throughout the country, with a total of more than 70 million water conservancy troops being dispatched. A total of more than 3.8 million water conservancy projects, including large and small reservoirs, ponds, canals, culverts, and machine wells, have been built across the country, and more than 27 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed. The original plan to expand and improve the irrigation area by 260 million mu has been completed. Preliminary control of soil erosion covers an area of 140,000 square kilometers.

With the advent of the high tide of water conservancy construction and the leap forward development of all aspects of the national economy, great progress has also been made in hydropower construction. In 1959, hydropower overfulfilled the state plan.

The great victories of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 undeniably proved the absolute correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" is the only correct line for accelerating socialist construction in our country. Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies such as simultaneous development of central and local authorities, simultaneous development of large and small enterprises, and simultaneous development of foreign and indigenous methods, the Party committees in various places have strengthened their leadership over water conservancy and hydropower construction, with the Party committees taking the lead personally, which has greatly given play to the enthusiasm of the local authorities and the broad masses. For the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub in Hubei Province, the Provincial Party Committee and the Governor personally presided over the construction site, concentrated 100,000 labor troops, mobilized the human and material resources of the entire province to provide support, carried out mass movements in a big way, and implemented the construction policy formulated by the Provincial Party Committee of "giving prominence to politics, strengthening leadership, relying on the masses, self-reliance, focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and prioritizing indigenous methods over foreign methods." In 1959, 400,000 cubic meters of concrete were completed for the dam body, and the Han River was successfully cut off. Since the decentralization of many enterprises in 1958, provinces (autonomous regions) have rapidly established survey, design, construction, and installation units, and the strength of water conservancy and hydropower construction has increased exponentially.

In 1959, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the vast number of water conservancy and hydropower workers carried out in-depth mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution, and set off a wave of offering suggestions and treasures, putting forward tens of thousands of technical innovation proposals, which greatly promoted the development of water conservancy and hydropower construction. Now, the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and manual lifting has been basically eliminated in many water conservancy project construction sites across the country, moving towards vehicle transportation and rail transportation, and advancing towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. Some construction sites have achieved linkage, and the degree of mechanization and work efficiency have been greatly improved. The entire process of the Yintao Project in Gansu Province has achieved soil mechanization, and the work efficiency has increased by several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times. The Ziyunshan Reservoir in Jiangxi Province carried out tool reform in a big way, greatly improving work efficiency, shortening the construction period by one year, and saving 4 million yuan in funds. Mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution have also been vigorously carried out in various survey and design departments. The Survey and Design Institute of the Liaoning Provincial Water Conservancy and Power Bureau, due to ideological liberation, made great efforts in "four modernizations" (mechanization, electrification, automation, and industrialization) and "six new aspects" (new theories, new methods, new forms, new materials, new equipment, and new technologies), and overfulfilled the annual planned workload 331 days ahead of schedule on February 4, 1960, victoriously entering 1961. According to the experience of the Great Leap Forward in recent years, self-reliance, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements are effective measures to solve the shortage of materials, equipment, and labor, and accelerate the high-speed development of water conservancy and hydropower construction. Furthermore, it can further break the superstition about running electricity. In fact, some people used to think that electricity was invisible and intangible, and it was impossible for everyone to engage in it, which was very mysterious. But now, all localities are vigorously developing electricity by the whole people, and have achieved great results. In hydropower stations, some people used to think that certain "cutting-edge" scientific technologies were impossible to achieve, but now they have been broken through by the broad masses, vigorously developing open-air workshops, power station automation, and remote control power stations. In the future, we must continue to adhere to giving prominence to politics, boldly mobilize the masses, break superstitions, liberate our minds, carry forward the spirit of daring to think and act, helping each other, and not being afraid of difficulties, and push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation) to a new peak. I deeply feel that as a water conservancy and hydropower constructor, I must actively devote myself to the torrent of this mass movement under the good leadership of the Communist Party and contribute my strength.

Due to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, people's mental outlook has also changed greatly, and their communist consciousness has greatly increased. "Giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself" has gradually become a common practice. In the Great Leap Forward, great cooperation was carried out among various units, departments, and regions, supporting each other, which greatly promoted the development of national construction undertakings. In water conservancy and hydropower construction, great support has been received from many units in the past, and full support has been received from relevant regions in the construction of many large-scale projects. During the construction of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub, almost all factories in Wuhan City supported equipment. During the emergency construction period of the Qinghe Reservoir Dam, some factories in Shenyang City stopped production and gave up belt conveyors for support. This spirit of communist cooperation is very valuable, worthy of our learning, and should continue to be promoted. This spirit can only exist under today's socialist system, and no capitalist country can have it at all.

In recent years, under the continuous education of the Chinese Communist Party and inspired by the Great Leap Forward situation, our ideological understanding has been significantly improved, but there is still a long way to go to meet the requirements of the Party and the people. Being in the great era of the 1960s today, in order to accelerate the socialist construction of our country, I feel that I must accelerate my ideological transformation in the future, conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in practice and labor, thoroughly transform the bourgeois standpoint and world outlook, and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, so as to adapt to the development of the Great Leap Forward situation.

Now the situation in our entire country is infinitely good, and the water conservancy and hydropower construction undertaking is also in a period of rapid development, and the situation is extremely favorable to us. I believe that with the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, with the rich experience of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, and with the revolutionary will and soaring enthusiasm of the 650 million people of the country, we will surely be able to victoriously overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan and realize a comprehensive, continuous, and greater leap forward in the national economy.

    水利、水电建设一日千里
    于开泉代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    1959年，在1958年大跃进胜利的基础上，我国人民在共产党和毛主席英明的领导下，坚持社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。特别是在中国共产党的八届八中全会决议反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召和鼓舞下。全国人民斗志昂扬，意气风发，超额完成了1959年的国民经济计划。提前三年完成了第二个五年计划提出的主要指标。这是我国人民的伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    1959年我国的水利水电建设事业与全国的其他建设事业一样也获得了巨大的成就。在水利建设上，1959年是我国解放以来自然灾害最严重的一年，受灾面积共达六亿五千万亩，占全部播种面积的30％，有八个省所属大部分的地方，在夏季连续三、四个月没有下雨，使近四亿亩农田受到了严重的灾害。但是在共产党的领导下，由于人民公社充分发挥了无比的优越性，掀起了水利建设的高潮，有效地组织了广大社员的抗灾斗争，兴修了无数大中小型水利工程，终于战胜了自然灾害，夺取了农业的丰收，实现了农业的继续大跃进。从1958年10月到1959年9月一年中，共完成土方和石方工程量一百三十亿立方米，新增灌溉面积达七千万亩，并且改善了大量原有的水利灌溉系统。1959年冬到1960年春，更大规模的水利建设高潮，已在全国蓬蓬勃勃地开展，一共出动了七千多万水利大军，全国建设的大小水库、塘坝、河渠、涵闸、机井等水利工程共三百八十多万处，目前已完成了土方和石方工程量二百七十多亿立方米。原定扩大和改善灌溉面积二亿六千万亩，已经完成。初步控制水土流失面积十四万平方公里。
    随着水利建设高潮的到来和国民经济各方面的飞跃发展，在水电建设方面也取得了很大的跃进，1959年水电超额完成了国家计划。
    1958年和1959年连续大跃进的伟大胜利，无可辩驳地证明了中国共产党的领导的绝对正确。党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，是我国加速进行社会主义建设唯一正确的路线。自从党中央和毛主席提出中央和地方同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法和土法同时并举等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针实行以后，各地党委加强了对水利水电建设的领导，由党委亲自挂帅，大大发挥了地方和广大群众的积极性。湖北省丹江口水利枢纽，省委、省长亲在工地主持，集中了十万劳动大军、动员了全省的人力物力进行支援，大搞群众运动，贯彻了省委制定的“政治挂帅、加强领导、依靠群众、自力更生、以土为主、土洋并举、先土后洋”的施工方针，1959年完成了坝体砼四十万立方米，并胜利截断了汉江。1958年许多企业下放以来，各省（区）都迅速成立了勘测、设计、施工和安装单位，水利水电建设力量都有了成倍的增长。
    1959年在中国共产党的八届八中全会的号召下，水利水电广大职工深入开展了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，掀起了献计、献宝的热潮，提出了成千上万的技术革新建议，大大推进了水利水电建设的发展。现在全国很多水利工程施工的工地已基本消灭了肩挑人抬的现象，走向车子化、轨道化，并向机械化、半机械化进军，有的工地已经实现了联动化，机械化程度和工效都大为提高。甘肃省引洮工程全部工序已经实现了土机械化，工效提高了几倍、几十倍，甚至几百倍。江西省紫云山水库大搞工具改革，工效大大提高，工期缩短了一年，经费节约四百万元。在各个勘测设计部门也轰轰烈烈地开展了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。辽宁省水利电力局勘测设计院由于思想解放，大闹“四化”（机械化、电气化、自动化、工厂化）、“六新”（新理论、新方法、新形式、新材料、新设备、新工艺），于1960年2月4日提前了三百三十一天超额完成了全年的计划工作量，胜利地跨入了1961年。根据几年来大跃进的经验证明，自力更生，洋土结合，大力开展技术革新和技术革命运动，是解决材料、设备和劳力不足，加速水利水电建设高速度发展的有效措施。并且还可以进一步破除对办电的迷信，事实上过去有的认为电是看不到摸不着的，不可能全民来搞，很神秘。而现在各地却大搞全民办电，已经取得了巨大的成绩；在水电站中过去有的认为不可能达到的科学技术“尖端”，而现在却被广大的群众攻破了，大搞露天厂房、电站自动化、远方控制电站等。今后我们必须继续坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢做互相帮助、不怕困难的精神，把以“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰。我深深感到做一个水利水电建设者，要很好在共产党的领导下，积极投入到这个群众运动的洪流中去，贡献自己的力量。
    由于社会主义建设的大跃进，人们的精神面貌也随着大大改变，共产主义觉悟大为高涨，“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”，已逐渐成为普遍的风尚。在大跃进中，各个单位、部门和地区之间开展了大协作，相互支援，大大促进了国家建设事业的发展。在水利水电建设上，过去得到了许多单位的大力支援，许多大型工程施工中得到了有关地区的全力支援。丹江口水利枢纽施工中武汉市几乎所有的工厂支援了设备；清河水库大坝抢筑时期，沈阳市有的工厂停止了生产，让出皮带机进行了支援。这种共产主义大协作的精神，是非常可贵的，是值得我们学习，并继续加以发扬的。这种精神只有在今天的社会主义制度下才有可能存在，任何资本主义国家是根本不会有的。
    几年来我们在中国共产党的不断教育下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，思想认识上有了显著的提高，但是与党和人民的要求还相差很远。处在今天二十世纪的六十年代伟大时代里，为了加速我国社会主义建设，我感到今后必须加速自我思想改造，认真学习毛主席的著作，积极参加到实践和劳动中去，彻底改造资产阶级立场和世界观，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，以适应大跃进形势的发展。
    现在我们整个国家的形势是无限的好，水利水电建设事业也正处在飞跃发展之中，形势对我们是极为有利。我相信有共产党和毛主席的正确领导，有总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，有1958年和1959年连续大跃进的丰富经验，有全国六亿五千万人民的革命意志和冲天干劲，我们一定能够胜利超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，实现国民经济全面继续的更大跃进。
