Breaking Superstition, Masses Run Electricity
Representative Xing Zhaotang Discusses Henan Province's Experiences in Mass Electricity Generation

Comrades,

I fully agree with and resolutely implement Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will only make the following statement on the situation of Henan Province carrying out the mass electricity generation movement.

    In the mass electricity generation movement, we, according to the central government's instructions on the electricity generation policy, seriously summarized the advanced experiences of various places, fully considered Henan's various favorable conditions, and put forward the "five main" electricity generation policy of "mainly hydropower, mainly small-scale, mainly commune-run, mainly indigenous methods, and mainly serving production," demanding electricity and power from water, fire, wind, and methane. Once this policy was put forward, it was immediately accepted by the broad masses and quickly pushed the mass electricity generation movement to a new climax. Learn technology, find materials, and build simple power generating equipment on a large scale

Henan's power industry has also undergone tremendous development in the past decade, especially since the two years of the Great Leap Forward, with the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The daily power generation is now equal to the total power generation of the entire year of 1949. However, due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, the power supply still falls far short of meeting the needs of production. In particular, the scale of water conservancy construction by the people's communes has expanded unprecedentedly, commune-run industries have developed rapidly, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all made comprehensive leaps forward, and the labor force is in severe shortage, urgently needing to solve the problems of power and electricity. In order to solve this problem, we have launched a mass electricity generation movement throughout the province since 1959. In this movement, we adopted the method of relying on the masses, self-reliance, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions, mobilized the masses to learn technology, find materials, and manufacture simple power generating equipment in large quantities, and within a very short period of time, set off a mass electricity generation upsurge and have already achieved great results. In the first quarter of this year alone, the masses in the province have built more than 2,300 power stations, with a capacity of more than 51,000 kilowatts, which is equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity of new power stations built in our province in the past decade. Adding the power stations built by the masses in 1959, the masses in the province have built a total of more than 5,500 power stations, with a capacity of more than 100,000 kilowatts. If calculated at ten laborers per kilowatt, it can save more than one million laborers. This not only solves the problem of insufficient power in some urban and rural areas and saves a large amount of labor, but also greatly improves labor productivity and promotes the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production. Now, rural power stations throughout the province are as numerous as stars in the sky and blooming everywhere. 80% of the rural people's communes already have their own small power stations, and the countryside has a brilliant scene. According to statistics from five counties, namely Shenqiu, Puyang, Jiaxian, Fangcheng, and Xihua, the electric power and power put into drought resistance this spring amounted to more than 8,400 horsepower, driving water lifting machinery to irrigate more than 180,000 mu of wheat every day, saving more than 60,000 laborers. Yuxian County has 40 factories and mines, and 232 workshops all use electricity to drive machines. All ten people's communes in the county universally use electric lights for lighting. Lushi County, located in the deep mountains, has electric lights continuously from the Wenyu Commune to the county seat, a distance of more than 20 li. The Xuchang Special Zone has already achieved that every commune has a power station. The era that the masses have been looking forward to for many years, "lighting lamps without oil and plowing the land without oxen," has begun. Ideological mobilization, experience summary, and technology promotion

The key to carrying out mass electricity generation lies first in solving ideological problems. Practice has proven that the development process of the mass electricity generation movement is also a process of struggle between two ideologies, two methods, and two roads. After the call for mass electricity generation was put forward, it was immediately warmly supported by the broad masses. However, a small number of people still had mystical views and fear of difficulties in their ideological understanding, saying things like, "Electricity is something that cannot be seen or touched, how can the masses run it?" "Generators are not simple, how can ordinary people manufacture them?" "Running electricity is a matter for the cities, it's not possible in the countryside," "Asking the masses to run electricity is forcing ducks onto a perch, it's impossible." People with right-leaning thoughts even said, "Without materials, without equipment, and without technology, it's impossible to run electricity," "Indigenous methods of running electricity are simply not feasible, they waste manpower and money," and even a power plant director said, "I've been a plant director for ten years and haven't fully understood it yet, how can the peasants run electricity!" Obviously, if these erroneous understandings and right-leaning thoughts are not thoroughly criticized and overcome, the policy of mass electricity generation cannot be implemented. Therefore, on the one hand, we vigorously carried out propaganda and education, fully mobilized the masses, organized airing of views and debates, and criticized various mystical views, fear of difficulties, and right-leaning thoughts; on the other hand, we seized the key points, created experiences, established pace-setters, and organized on-site visits to break superstition, liberate thinking, and lay the ideological foundation for carrying out the mass electricity generation movement.

In the mass electricity generation movement, we, according to the central government's instructions on the electricity generation policy, seriously summarized the advanced experiences of various places, fully considered Henan's various favorable conditions, such as the large-scale water conservancy construction carried out for two years, with rivers and canals crisscrossing and abundant hydropower resources; abundant coal resources; and the great development of commune-run industries, with a great increase in mechanical manufacturing capacity, capable of manufacturing simple power generating equipment, etc. We put forward the "five main" electricity generation policy of "mainly hydropower, mainly small-scale, mainly commune-run, mainly indigenous methods, and mainly serving production," demanding electricity and power from water, fire, wind, and methane. Once this policy was put forward, it was immediately accepted by the broad masses and quickly pushed the mass electricity generation movement to a new climax. Experience has proven that earnestly implementing the "five main" policy can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people's communes and the broad masses for running electricity, achieve the requirements of less investment, more manufacturing, fast speed, and great effectiveness, thereby promoting the further development of commune-run industries, saving a large amount of labor and animal power in the countryside, improving production efficiency, beautifying people's lives, and also greatly contributing to the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes. Finding, digging, donating, and substituting are good ways to solve the shortage of materials

Practice has proven that once the policy is determined and the ideological problems are basically solved, the electricity generation itself is to break through the "three barriers" of materials, equipment, and technology. In solving the problem of material difficulties, the method of "finding, digging, donating, and substituting" was mainly adopted, with appropriate support from the state, breaking through the material barrier. Using this method, the masses throughout the province had automatically donated more than 8,000 tons of various metal materials by the end of March, including more than 1,300 tons of copper, more than 700 tons of iron sheets, 170,000 cubic meters of timber, and more than 54 million blue bricks. For example, Yuxian County donated 210,000 jin of copper in seven days. The masses in Chengguan, Yancheng County, excavated two airplanes that were destroyed by the Kuomintang twenty years ago and used them as electricity generation materials. Jixian, Puyang, Luohe, and other places replaced the white iron sheet roofs with tiles, basically solving the material difficulties of electricity generation. In solving the problem of equipment difficulties, the method of self-reliance and indigenous methods was adopted to manufacture simple equipment. If there were no silicon steel sheets, white pig iron, white iron sheets, and black iron sheets were used to replace them; if there were no medium carbon steel shafts, pig iron castings were used to replace them; if there were no yarn-covered wires, copper was refined, wire was drawn, and yarn was covered by ourselves; if there were no magnetizers, mechanical rectification was used instead. At present, county machinery factories and many people's communes, organs, schools, shops, and farms throughout the province can manufacture simple power generating equipment. Nineteen counties and cities have successfully manufactured 100, 200, and 300 kilowatt generators. In the first quarter of this year, the province modified and manufactured 2,273 power generating equipment, with a capacity of 23,100 kilowatts, thereby breaking through the equipment manufacturing barrier. In solving the problem of technical difficulties, we relied on the "five artisans" of iron, silver, copper, wood, and masonry in the county and commune machinery factories and rural areas, and the provincial and special district organized mobile technical guidance teams to conduct guidance in various places on a regular basis. And with the construction site as the classroom, the project as the teaching material, and the methods of sending out, inviting in, and on-site visits, the technical barrier was broken through. Since the mass electricity generation movement, the province has trained more than 50,000 relatively skilled technical personnel and more than 100,000 personnel with general technical skills. At the same time, we vigorously carried out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, gradually turning manual operations into semi-mechanized and mechanized production. Yuxian County alone improved 61 types of motor manufacturing tools, 891 pieces. In the past, only one 12-kilowatt generator could be manufactured in a month. Now, three 12-kilowatt to 48-kilowatt generators can be manufactured in one day.

At present, the mass electricity generation movement in Henan Province is developing in a more in-depth and extensive direction. From the province to the special districts, cities, counties, and people's communes, organizational structures for managing the mass electricity generation are being further improved, the leadership of the movement is being strengthened, and water, fire, wind, and methane are being widely utilized. "If there are mountains, rely on the mountains; if there is water, rely on the water," to make more full use of all the power resources of nature; equipment manufacturing is also rapidly developing from indigenous to foreign, from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, relying on the strength of the people's communes, the mass electricity generation movement in Henan Province will surely achieve a greater leap forward in 1960, and will surely more powerfully promote the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production.

    破除迷信  群众办电
    邢肇棠代表谈河南省群众办电的体会
    在全民办电运动中，我们根据中央指示的办电方针，认真总结了各地的先进经验，充分考虑了河南的各种有利条件，提出了“以水力为主、小型为主、社办为主、土法为主、服务生产为主”的“五主”办电方针，向水、火、风、沼要电力和动力。这一方针一经提出，立即为广大群众所接受，迅速地把全民办电运动推向了新的高潮。各位代表：
    我完全同意并坚决贯彻执行李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及人大常委会的工作报告。现在，我仅就河南省开展全民办电运动的情况，作如下发言。	  学技术，找材料，大造简易发电设备
    河南的电力工业，十年来，特别是两年大跃进以来随着工农业生产的连续大跃进，也有了巨大的发展，现在一天的发电量就等于1949年全年的发电量。但是，由于工农业生产和各项建设事业的飞跃发展，电力供应仍然远远不能满足生产的需要。特别是人民公社水利建设规模空前扩大，社办工业迅速发展，农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进，劳动力深感不足，迫切需要解决动力和电力问题。为了解决这一问题，我们从1959年以来，在全省范围内开展了一个全民办电运动。在这一运动中，我们采取了依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材，因地制宜的办法，发动群众学技术、找材料、大量制造简易发电设备，在很短的时间内，掀起了全民办电高潮，已经取得了很大成绩。仅今年第一季度，全省群众就办起电站二千三百多处，容量五万一千多瓩，这个数字相当于我省十年来新建电站设备容量的20％。加上1959年群众举办的电站，全省群众共办电站五千五百多处，容量十万多瓩，若按每个瓩折合十个劳力计算，就可节省劳力一百多万人。这不仅解决了一部分城乡动力不足的问题，节省了大量劳动力，而且大大提高了劳动生产率，促进了工农业生产高速度发展。现在，全省农村电站已经星罗棋布、遍地开花，80％的农村人民公社都已经有了自己的小型电站，农村出现了一派光辉灿烂的景象。据沈丘、濮阳、郟县、方城和西华五个县的统计，今春投入抗旱的电力、动力就有八千四百多马力，带动提水机械每天浇麦十八万多亩，节约了劳力六万多个。禹县有四十个厂矿，二百三十二个车间都用电力来带动机器，全县十个人民公社普遍都用电灯照明。位处深山区的卢氏县，从文峪公社到县城，二十多里路，村村不断电灯。许昌专区已经实现了社社有电站。群众多年盼望的“点灯不用油、犁地不用牛”的时代已经开始了。	思想大动员，经验大总结，技术大推广
    开展全民办电的关键，首先在于解决思想问题。实践证明，全民办电运动的发展过程，也是两种思想、两种方法、两条道路的斗争过程。当全民办电的号召提出以后，立即受到了广大群众的热烈拥护。但是，也有一少部分人在思想认识上存在着神秘观点和畏难情绪，说什么“电是看不见摸不住的东西，群众怎么能办？”“发电机可不简单，一般人哪能制造？”“办电是城市的事，农村不行”，“要群众办电是赶鸭子上架，不可能的事。”有右倾思想的人还说什么“一无材料，二无设备，三无技术，根本办不成电”，“土法办电根本不行，劳民伤财”，甚至有一个电厂厂长说：“我当了十年厂长，还没有完全弄懂，农民怎么能办电！”很明显，这些错误认识和右倾思想，如果不加以彻底批判和克服，全民办电的方针就无法贯彻。因此，我们一方面大力进行了宣传教育，充分发动群众，组织鸣放辩论，批判了各种神秘观点、畏难情绪和右倾思想；一方面抓住重点，创造经验，树立标兵，现场参观，用实际事例，来破除迷信，解放思想，为开展全民办电运动奠定了思想基础。
    在全民办电运动中，我们根据中央指示的办电方针，认真总结了各地的先进经验，充分考虑了河南的各种有利条件，如大搞了两年的水利建设，河渠纵横，水力资源丰富；煤炭资源很丰富；社办工业有了很大发展，机械制造能力有了很大增长，能够制造简易发电设备，等等。提出了“以水力为主、小型为主、社办为主、土法为主、服务生产为主”的“五主”办电方针，向水、火、风、沼要电力和动力。这一方针一经提出，立即就为广大群众所接受，迅速地把全民办电运动推向了新的高潮。经验证明：认真地贯彻执行“五主”方针，就能充分调动人民公社和广大群众的办电积极性，达到投资少，制造多，速度快，收效大的要求，从而促进社办工业的进一步发展，节省农村的大量劳力和畜力，提高生产效率，美化人民生活，对人民公社的巩固和提高也有很大作用。	找、挖、献、代是解决材料不足的好办法
    实践证明：在方针一旦确定，思想问题得到基本解决的情况下，办电的本身就是要突破材料、设备和技术“三关”。在解决材料困难的问题上，采取以“找、挖、献、代”为主，国家适当给以扶持的办法，突破了材料关。我们采用这个办法，全省到3月底，群众自动献出各种金属材料八千多吨，其中铜一千三百多吨，铁皮七百多吨，木材十七万立方米，青砖五千四百多万块。例如，禹县在七天时间中就献出铜二十一万斤。郾城县城关群众把二十年前国民党摔毁的两架飞机挖掘出来，当作办电材料。汲县、濮阳、漯河等地用瓦换下了白铁皮房顶，基本上解决了办电的材料困难。在解决设备困难的问题上，采用自力更生，土法上马的办法，来制造简易设备。没有矽钢片，就用白生铁、白铁皮、黑铁皮来代替；没有中炭钢大轴，就用生铁铸造来代替；没有纱包线就自己炼铜，自己拔丝，自己包纱；没有砺磁机就用机械整流代替。目前全省各县机械厂和不少人民公社、机关、学校、商店、农场均能制造简易发电设备，有十九个县、市已经制造成功了一百、二百、三百瓩的发电机。今年第一季度，全省就改制和制造发电设备二千二百七十三台，容量二万三千一百瓩，从而突破了设备制造关。在解决技术困难问题上，依靠了县、社机械厂和农村铁、银、铜、木、泥水等“五匠”，省、专组织了巡回技术辅导小组，经常到各地进行指导。并以工地为课堂，工程为教材，和派出去、请进来、现场参观等办法，突破了技术关。全民办电以来，全省共培养了较为熟练的技术人材五万余人，具有一般技术水平的人材十万余人。同时大力地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，把手工操作逐渐变成为半机械化、机械化生产。仅禺县一县就改良了制造电机的工具六十一种，八百九十一件，过去一个月只能制造一台十二瓩的发电机，现在一天就能制造三台十二瓩至四十八瓩的发电机。
    目前，河南省的全民办电运动，正在向着更加深入、更加广泛的方向发展。从省到专、市、县和人民公社都正在进一步健全掌管全民办电的组织机构，加强运动的领导，广泛地利用水、火、风、沼，“有山靠山，有水靠水”，更充分地来使用自然界的一切动力资源；设备制造也正在由土到洋，由手工操作到半机械化、机械化的方向迅速发展。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社的力量，河南省全民办电运动，一定会在1960年出现一个更大的跃进，一定会更有力地促进工农业生产的高速度发展。
