Observations from Inspection
Speech by Committee Member Dong Wenlong

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian regarding the draft national economic plan for 1960 and the draft state budget for 1959 and 1960. The reports by the two vice premiers truly demonstrate the ambitious goals of our 650 million people in building socialism and present a more glorious and splendid vision. I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Before coming to Beijing, I conducted inspections and visits in Wulian, Pingdu, and Feicheng counties in Shandong Province. Through these inspections and visits, I once again received a profound and practical socialist education, which further strengthened my confidence and determination to listen to the Party and follow the socialist path.

Wulian County is an old liberated area with barren land, mountains, and little water. Chairman Mao was particularly concerned about the lives of the people in the old liberated areas. To develop and green this area, he gave 25,000 apple trees to the region. These small trees brought wisdom and strength to the people of Wulian County. Under Chairman Mao's enthusiastic care and encouragement, relying on the collective strength of the people's communes, they greened the high mountains and hills of the entire county: Masson pines were planted all over the mountains, sawtooth oak trees (which can raise tussah silkworms) covered the hillsides, and apple, pear, and peach trees turned into forests at the foot of the mountains. In just two years, the barren mountains of Wulian County were transformed into lush, colorful orchards. During our visit, we could eat large, fragrant, and sweet apples produced by themselves everywhere. Wulian County has done an especially good job in soil and water conservation. Their water storage measures include digging fish-scale pits, building intercepting dams, digging rivers around mountains, and building reservoirs. This allows them to retain all sixty millimeters of rainwater on the mountains, preventing it from flooding freely. The slogan of the people of Wulian County is: "Turn low yield into high yield, turn Wulian into Jiangnan." I believe that their ambitious goals will be fully realized in the near future. People across the country sing praises of the Communist Party, saying: "The Communist Party is like the sun, shining brightly wherever it goes." It is the sunshine of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao that has illuminated Wulian County, warming the hearts of all working people in Wulian County! Can you imagine how the people of Wulian County could not love the great Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao even more?

Facts prove that as long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we hold high the three victorious red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the infinite wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of the masses can be better brought into play. For example, the members of the Chengguan People's Commune in Pingdu County, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, have tried every possible means to vigorously develop water conservancy projects. They used methods such as "three relocations" (relocating wells, relocating springs, relocating ponds), "intercepting subsurface flow," and "spring-group rivers" to achieve land terracing, electrified lighting, and self-flowing irrigation, creating excellent results in water conservancy construction. From this, it can be seen that once the working people become masters of the country, they have no insurmountable difficulties, no unimaginable methods, and no impossible tasks in accelerating the change of the "poor and blank" face. When we visited the tunnel water diversion and irrigation project of the Taoyuan People's Commune in Feicheng, we were even more deeply inspired and educated. The Taoyuan People's Commune is located south of Baiyun Mountain, with undulating mountains and extremely difficult access to drinking water since ancient times. Irrigating the land was even more unimaginable. Although there is a "Kangwang River" flowing continuously to the north of Baiyun Mountain, it can only be sighed at across the mountain. Throughout the motherland, horses are galloping, and socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. Under the leadership of the Party, the members of the Taoyuan People's Commune also displayed the communist spirit of "daring to think and dare to do." The county party secretary personally took charge, and the masses were full of enthusiasm. Finally, they dug a tunnel through the three-hundred-meter-thick Baiyun Mountain, and the water of the "Kangwang River" obediently flowed from the north of the mountain to the south. This not only solved the drinking water problem for the commune members, but also turned all the commune's land into self-flowing irrigated terraced fields. The ideal since ancient times has become a reality. Chairman Mao said: We must do things that our predecessors have never done. The Taoyuan Commune has done just that.

Seeing the development of the above-mentioned people's communes has made me further deeply realize the unparalleled superiority of the "large and public" people's communes: it can rapidly develop and create social productive forces, and continuously improve the material and cultural life of the commune members. It is the best organizational form for the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and also the best organizational form for the transition from socialism to communism. Various aspects and numerous facts are proving that the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the guarantee of the victory of socialist construction. Now, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being carried out enthusiastically across the country. This is a mass production revolution, which not only guarantees the early and over-fulfillment of the continued Great Leap Forward of the 1960 national economic plan, but also brings infinite beautiful prospects to the 650 million people of all nationalities in the country. I am the Catholic bishop of the Jinan Diocese. Facts have educated me and made me love the new China and love socialism. I am determined to follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

As everyone knows, the brilliant achievements and victories of our country are the failure of imperialism, and our joy is the sorrow of imperialism. Facts tell us that imperialists are unwilling to accept their defeat in increasingly sad days. Now, US imperialism is playing tricks of fake peace and real war preparation, undermining the increasingly easing international situation, and continuing to occupy our territory Taiwan, threatening the security of the people of Asian countries, especially the people of our country. At the same time, it is stepping up its use of Catholicism to carry out conspiracies and sabotage against our country with its tool of aggression—the Roman Curia, attempting to subvert our people's democratic regime. But no matter what conspiracies and tricks US imperialism and the Roman Curia play, they cannot escape the tragic fate of all imperialists and reactionaries: "Make trouble, fail; make trouble again, fail again, until their extinction." This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will still be the case in the future.

As early as 1946, Yang Enlai (former German bishop of the Jinan Diocese, now deceased), a loyal lackey of the Roman Curia and a veteran imperialist, colluded with international spy Lei Zhenyuan and Kuomintang military intelligence agent Chen Zhenhua (who has been suppressed) to establish a reactionary armed special agent organization in Jinan—"Shandong Provincial People's Salvation Corps"; In 1948, on the eve of the liberation of Jinan, Yang Enlai vigorously supported the Kuomintang reactionaries and, in the name of "protecting the church," recruited a large number of young Catholics from all over Shandong to form a counter-revolutionary armed force—the "999" troops—in the Hongjialou Catholic Church in Jinan, and dispatched counter-revolutionary Wan Fengcheng to serve as the "guidance chaplain" of this reactionary force, collecting military, political, and economic information from our liberated areas, expanding counter-revolutionary forces, and attempting to subvert the people's democratic regime already established in our old liberated areas. After liberation, he again instructed imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements to establish a reactionary organization, the "Legion of Mary," to distribute reactionary "encyclicals" from the Roman Curia, persecute patriotic clergy and Catholics, and actively undermine the anti-imperialist patriotic movement launched by Catholics in Jinan. No wonder that in the liberation war in Jinan, the Roman Curia was worried about Yang Enlai's fate when they didn't hear from him for a few days!

After the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group was formed, it was rampant for a time under the support of US imperialism and the Roman Curia, stirring up trouble and carrying out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities throughout the country. My Jinan Diocese suffered greatly from it. This counter-revolutionary treasonous group, under the instigation of American spy Hua Lizhu, dispatched counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary "Young Christian Workers" to collude with the Dong Haiyan counter-revolutionary group in Jinan, wearing the cloak of religion, to undermine the implementation of various national political movements and policies, laws, and decrees; openly incited clergy and Catholics to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government; undermined the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics in Jinan and other places, persecuted patriotic clergy and Catholics, and so on. These counter-revolutionary elements' conspiracies and sabotage activities brought certain difficulties to the anti-imperialist patriotic movement in Jinan and other places. But dark clouds cannot cover the sun after all. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the clergy and Catholics in Jinan have continuously improved their political consciousness and gradually recognized the reactionary political faces of these counter-revolutionary elements. As a result, the imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements in Jinan have successively received the punishments they deserved. This is the victory of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics in Jinan. This victory was a heavy blow to imperialism and the Roman Curia.

Recently, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the veteran American spy Hua Lizhu were justly sanctioned by our country's laws, which once again shows that the fate of imperialism and all reactionaries is tragic. The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's sentencing of the fourteen counter-revolutionary treasonous elements headed by Gong Pinmei and the American spy Hua Lizhu to imprisonment is completely correct, and I express my heartfelt support. However, the US government was greatly annoyed by this, openly defended Hua Lizhu's espionage activities, and wantonly slandered our government. May I ask, what role can this play other than further exposing that Hua Lizhu's criminal activities in China are a link in the US government's consistent conspiracy to subvert the Chinese government? In our country, there is freedom of religious belief, and legitimate religious activities have always been protected by the Constitution. This is a fact that we have personally experienced in the past ten years since liberation. US imperialism's attempt to slander our government and deceive the people of the world by falsely using the issue of religious belief will never succeed.

US imperialism and the Roman Curia are the mortal enemies of the people of the whole country and also the mortal enemies of Catholics across the country. The anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics must be carried out more widely and deeply, and Chinese Catholicism must thoroughly achieve independence and autonomy. In order to accelerate the construction of the socialist motherland, I am willing to work together with Catholics across the country (including the clergy) to strive for self-transformation, and on the basis of continuously improving patriotism and socialist consciousness, resolutely break away from the control of the Roman Curia, thoroughly eliminate its ideological influence, and actively participate in socialist construction under the leadership of the Party, wholeheartedly following the socialist road.

### 视察观感  董文隆委员的发言

    视察观感
    董文隆委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。两位副总理的报告，的确显示了我国六亿五千万人民建设社会主义的雄心壮志，展现出一幅更光辉灿烂的美景。我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    来京之前，我曾在山东省五莲、平度、肥城等地进行了视察和参观；通过视察参观，使我再一次受到既深刻又实际的社会主义教育，从而更加坚定了听党的话，走社会主义道路的信心和决心。
    五莲县是一个土地贫瘠、多山少水的老解放区。毛主席是特别关心老解放区人民的生活的，为发展和绿化这个地区，他曾赠给该地区两万五千株苹果树，这些小树给五莲县的人民带来了智慧和力量。他们在毛主席的热切关怀和鼓舞下，依靠人民公社的集体力量，绿化了全县的高山丘岭：马尾松栽满了山上，柞树（能养柞蚕）植满了山坡，苹果树、梨树、桃树等变为山下丛林。仅仅两年的时间，五莲县的童山秃岭都变成了草木丛生、万紫千红的花果山。我们在参观期间，到处都可吃到他们自产的硕大香甜的苹果。五莲县的水土保持工作搞的特别好，他们的蓄水措施是挖鱼鳞坑，筑截水坝，开围山河，修水库，等等。这样就可将六十毫米的雨水完全留在山上，不让它自由泛滥。五莲县人民的口号是：“使低产变高产，使五莲变江南”。我相信，他们的雄心壮志，在不久的将来是完全可以实现的。全国人民歌颂共产党说：“共产党像太阳，照到哪里哪里亮”。正是共产党、毛主席的阳光照亮了五莲县，温暖着五莲县所有劳动人民的心！你想，五莲县的人民怎能不更加热爱伟大的共产党和英明的领袖毛主席呢？
    事实证明，只要有共产党和毛主席的领导，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面胜利红旗，人民群众的无穷智慧和冲天干劲就可以更好地发挥出来。例如平度县城关人民公社的社员们，在社党委的领导下，千方百计地大搞水利建设。他们用“三搬倒”（搬倒井、搬倒泉、搬倒塘）、“截潜流”、“泉组河”等办法达到了土地畦田化、照明电气化、灌溉自流化，在水利建设方面创造出优异成绩。由此可见，劳动人民一旦当了国家的主人，他们为加速改变“一穷二白”的面貌，没有克服不了的困难，没有想不到的办法，没有办不到的事情。当我们参观肥城桃园人民公社的隧道引水灌溉工程时，受到的鼓舞和教育更大更深。桃园人民公社位于白云山之南，山岭起伏，自古以来吃水极端困难，用水浇地那更是不敢想像的事。在白云山之北，虽有一道长流不息的“康王河”，但由于一山之隔，也只能望河兴叹。祖国各地，万马奔腾，社会主义建设，突飞猛进，桃园人民公社的社员们在党的领导下也发挥了“敢想敢干”的共产主义精神，县委书记亲自挂帅，人民群众干劲冲天，终于把三百米厚的白云山凿了一条隧道，“康王河”的流水驯服地从山北流到山南。这样不但解决了社员们的吃水问题，同时所有的公社土地都变成了自流灌溉的畦田。自古以来的理想，变为现实。毛主席说过：我们要做前人未曾做过的事。桃园公社做的就是这样的事。
    看到以上几处人民公社的发展情况，使我进一步深切地认识到“一大二公”的人民公社的无比优越性：它既能迅速地发展和创造社会生产力，又能不断地改善社员的物质和文化生活。它是由社会主义集体所有制过渡到社会主义全民所有制的最好组织形式，也是由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好组织形式。各个方面的、许许多多的事实都在证明着总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，是社会主义建设事业胜利的保证。现在以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国范围内热火朝天地开展着，这是一个群众性的生产大革命，它不但能够保证提前和超额完成继续大跃进的1960年国民经济计划，而且给全国六亿五千万各族人民带来了无限美好的前景。我是济南教区的天主教的主教，事实教育了我，使我热爱新中国，热爱社会主义，我坚决在中国共产党的领导下走社会主义道路。
    大家知道，我们国家的辉煌成就和胜利就是帝国主义的失败，我们的喜悦就是帝国主义的悲伤。事实告诉我们，帝国主义者在日益悲伤的日子里，是不甘心它的失败的。现在美帝国主义正在玩弄假和平真备战的花招，破坏日趋缓和的国际局势，还继续霸占着我国的领土台湾，威胁亚洲各国人民尤其是我国人民的安全。与此同时，它又与它的侵略工具——罗马教廷加紧利用天主教对我国进行阴谋破坏活动，妄图颠复我国人民民主政权。但不管美帝国主义和罗马教廷搞什么阴谋诡计，也逃脱不了一切帝国主义者和反动派“捣乱，失败；再捣乱，再失败，直到灭亡”的悲惨命运。过去是这样，现在是这样，将来仍然也是这样。
    早在1946年，罗马教廷的忠实走狗、老牌的帝国主义分子杨恩赉（前济南教区德籍主教，已死。）曾勾结国际间谍分子雷震远和国民党军统特务陈镇华（已被镇压），在济南建立了反动武装特务组织——“山东省民众救国团”；1948年，济南解放前夕，杨恩赉又大力支持国民党反动派，以“保护教会”为名，从山东各地搜罗了大批青年教友在济南洪家楼天主教堂内组成反革命武装——“九九九”部队，并派遣反革命分子万风程充任这个反动部队的“指导司铎”，搜集我解放区的军事、政治、经济等情报，扩展反革命势力，企图颠复我老解放区已经建立起来的人民民主政权。解放后，他又指使帝国主义分子和反革命分子成立反动组织
  “圣母军”，散发罗马教廷的反动“通谕”，迫害爱国神职人员和教友，积极破坏济南天主教友掀起的反帝爱国运动。无怪乎在济南的解放战争中，罗马教廷几天不得杨恩赉的消息就为他的命运而担忧啊！
    龚品梅反革命叛国集团组成后，在美帝国主义和罗马教廷的支持下，曾疯狂一时，在全国各地兴风作浪，进行反革命破坏活动，我济南教区深受其害。这个反革命叛国集团在美国间谍分子华理柱的指使下，曾派遣反革命分子和反动“公青”分子与济南的董海宴反革命集团勾结起来，披着宗教外衣，破坏国家各项政治运动和政策、法律、法令的实施；公开煽动神职人员和教友反对共产党和人民政府；破坏济南等地天主教友的反帝爱国运动，迫害爱国神职人员和教友，等等。这些反革命分子的阴谋破坏活动曾给济南等地的反帝爱国运动带来了一定的困难。但是乌云毕竟遮不住太阳，济南的神职人员和教友在党和政府的领导下，政治觉悟不断提高，逐步认识了这些反革命分子的反动政治面目，结果在济南的帝国主义分子和反革命分子都先后受到他们应得的惩处。这是济南天主教友反帝爱国运动的胜利。这个胜利对帝国主义和罗马教廷来说，是一次沉重的打击。
    最近龚品梅反革命叛国集团和老牌美国间谍分子华理柱受到我国法律的严正制裁，又一次说明帝国主义和一切反动派的命运是悲惨的。上海中级人民法院分别判处以龚品梅为首的十四名反革命叛国分子和美国间谍分子华理柱以徒刑是完全正确的，我表示衷心拥护。可是美国政府却因此大为恼火，公开为华理柱的间谍活动进行辩护，并对我国政府大肆诬蔑，试问，这除了更加暴露华理柱在中国的犯罪活动是美国政府一贯图谋颠复中国政府的阴谋活动的一个环节之外，还能起什么作用呢？在我国有宗教信仰的自由，正当的宗教活动一贯受到宪法的保护，这是解放十年来我们亲身经历的事实。美帝国主义再想假借什么宗教信仰问题诽谤我国政府，欺骗世界人民，那是决不能得逞的。
    美帝国主义和罗马教廷是全国人民的死敌，也是全国天主教友的死敌。中国天主教友的反帝爱国运动必须更广泛更深入地开展下去，中国天主教必须彻底实现独立自主。为加速建设社会主义祖国，我愿意同全国天主教友（包括神职人员在内）在一起，努力自我改造，在爱国主义和社会主义觉悟不断提高的基础上，坚决摆脱罗马教廷的控制，彻底肃清它的思想影响，在党的领导下，积极主动地参加社会主义建设，一心一意地走社会主义道路。
