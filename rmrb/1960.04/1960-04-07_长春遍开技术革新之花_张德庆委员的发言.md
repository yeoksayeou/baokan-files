Comrade Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members:

I wholeheartedly agree with and support the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian.

Before coming to Beijing, I participated in an inspection organized by the Jilin Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial CPPCC in Changchun City. Now I would like to share some superficial experiences and immature opinions. I hope to "cast a brick to attract jade" and invite everyone to offer valuable suggestions for promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    Technical Innovation in Factories and Restaurants
    Both Male and Female Workers Invent and Create

Since the Spring Festival, under the leadership of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Changchun Municipal Party Committee, a vigorous and far-reaching technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been launched in Changchun. By now, not only has a large amount of heavy manual labor been transformed into mechanical operation throughout the city, but also the appearance of factories and workshops is being renovated every day.

The characteristics of this movement in Changchun are its broad scope of innovation and the recognition by participants that the movement is closely related to themselves. Not only do large factories engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, but also medium-sized and small factories are marching towards automation. Not only do veteran workers invent and create, but also female workers and young workers have made fruitful contributions to technical innovation. Everyone does not work alone, but rather effectively leverages the combination of leading personnel, the masses of workers, and technical personnel. Not only are new technologies applied in industrial production, but also cutting-edge technologies are integrated with daily life. A brand-new large factory in Changchun has added more than one hundred automatic production lines since the launch of the technical innovation movement, quadrupling its output, and it is still increasing. The employees of the Changchun Cigarette Factory have emancipated their minds and created automatic equipment, including packaging machines, linking the factory's production equipment from feeding to packaging into a complete automatic production line. What is most inspiring is that the masses are truly promoting the communist style of combining daring thought and action with a scientific attitude. The Changchun Restaurant has adopted cutting-edge technology to serve its customers. They have mechanized and automated heavy manual labor. Originally, one person delivered food and dishes, walking up and down the stairs for six to seventy li a day; now food and dish delivery is automated. Originally, it took more than twenty minutes to mix a bag of flour, now this task is mechanized, reducing the time to four minutes. Rice washing, vegetable cutting, making flower rolls, and making dumplings are all mechanized. In the mechanized rice washing process, the removal of sand particles is more thorough than hand washing. The selling of sesame cakes and soybean milk is automated. Customers only need to insert copper coins equivalent to the price of sesame cakes or soybean milk into the vending machine, and the vending machine will automatically dispense the corresponding sesame cakes or soybean milk. If customers want to wash their hands, they only need to turn on the tap, and the gas will automatically ignite, and the flowing water will be at the right temperature for washing hands. When customers approach the restaurant and reach the door, the photoelectric control mechanism automatically opens the door to allow customers to enter the restaurant. After realizing the comprehensive utilization of thermal energy, the income from selling recovered steam exceeds the value of the coal consumed. The requirements for these technical innovations were all proposed by the working comrades of the Changchun Restaurant, and most of the mechanized and automated machines were designed and manufactured by the working comrades in the restaurant. The application of cutting-edge technology was created through a three-way combination. The Changchun Xiuli Grain Store has a total of six female staff members, some illiterate, some with elementary school education, and only one with a junior high school first grade education. After liberating their minds, they were determined to develop a weighing and dispensing system for all goods controlled by one person remotely. They received the support of the Party and the assistance of scientific and technological workers, and finally realized the remote control weighing and dispensing of granular grains such as rice, sorghum, millet, and liquid goods.

With the arrival of technical innovation, came a greater leap forward in production. Labor shortages and equipment deficiencies have been alleviated, transportation efficiency has been improved, and production costs have gradually decreased. The state can use more investment to develop cutting-edge technology. The comprehensive utilization of raw materials has expanded the source of materials, mechanical operation has replaced heavy manual labor, labor conditions have been greatly improved, and the efficiency of learning culture and technology has been improved accordingly. In the battle of technical innovation, a proletarian scientific team has been cultivated. In the practice of technical innovation, the people of the whole country have further promoted the communist style of combining daring thought and action with a scientific attitude and large-scale collaboration, creating favorable conditions for further development of technical innovation and technical revolution. People have a clearer understanding that in socialist countries, the working people create machines to improve labor conditions, while in capitalist countries, capitalists enslave the working people as machines, thus raising awareness. All this guarantees a greater leap forward in 1960.

    The Increased Production and Conservation of Raw Materials is a Key Issue in the Great Leap Forward and Should be Regarded as an Important Part of Technical Innovation

In the situation of the Great Leap Forward that comes with technical innovation, it is difficult for the growth of naturally growing raw materials to keep up with labor productivity. Therefore, the increased production and conservation of raw materials remains a key issue in the Great Leap Forward and should be regarded as an important part of technical innovation. As far as my own profession, the automobile industry, is concerned, I believe that any measures that can expand fuel resources and save raw materials should be studied and utilized under favorable conditions, regardless of whether or not they have already been adopted. For example:

1.  Producer gas can replace gasoline and is a resource that can be widely promoted. With the development of the comprehensive utilization of coal, China will produce gradually increasing amounts of semi-coke. However, to fully utilize semi-coke as a fuel for internal combustion engines, the most suitable gasification speed of semi-coke in the gas producer should first be studied, that is, the airflow speed, in meters per second, through the gasification layer of the producer that enables the internal combustion engine to generate the maximum average effective pressure. This research should be based on China's most important semi-coke. By measuring the most suitable gasification speed of semi-coke, the size of the producer can be determined according to the displacement and speed of the gas engine. This is an important aspect of expanding the fuel resources of internal combustion engines. Studying this topic can avoid a lot of intangible waste.

2.  Water injection in internal combustion engines can save fuel to varying degrees under different conditions. People have been researching it continuously for more than sixty years, but it has not yet been fully understood. In the early days, water was injected into gas engines to avoid pre-ignition. According to foreign publications, using the same type of gasoline, water injection in gasoline engines can generally increase the compression ratio by one unit. Under the condition of simultaneously adjusting the ignition to the most favorable advance angle, the power per liter can be increased by 11% and fuel can be saved by about 10%. According to Soviet publications, the GAZ-5 automobile engine saved 33% of gasoline due to water injection during long-term road tests on automobiles. In diesel engines, atomizing the diesel fuel with a nozzle before injecting it into the cylinder can improve the atomization, and at the same time, internal cooling can replace part of the water tank cooling. If the amount of water mixed is appropriate, the exhaust temperature will not decrease, and the reduction in the heat of the water tank corresponds to the heat of vaporization of the amount of water mixed. Selecting diesel engines with high combustion chamber wall temperatures and easy coking of lubricating oil as the object of water injection can save more diesel fuel and extend the service life of the lubricating oil.

    The injected water must be softened to prevent the formation of boiler scale. Water injection should be carried out during the intake (or fuel injection) stroke or in the early stage of the compression stroke. The water injection must be stopped before stopping the engine. Rust prevention measures must be taken for long-term parking.

3.  Using liquefied methane in automobiles can save steel compared to using compressed natural gas. Cooling natural gas to about minus one hundred and twenty-two degrees Celsius yields liquefied methane. Using it as a fuel for automobiles can reduce the compression to ten atmospheres compared to using two hundred atmospheres of natural gas, reduce the weight of the gas storage cylinder by four-fifths, double the range, and improve the safety of use. Liquefied methane requires insulation. The rigid foam produced in China is an excellent insulation material and is now used in China as insulation and soundproofing material for railway passenger cars.

4.  The optimal utilization of coke oven gas and city gas needs further consideration. According to recent test results in Shanghai on automobiles using compressed coke oven gas, after replacing the engine of the Liberation brand automobile with a cylinder head more suitable for burning coke oven gas, the maximum power (2400 rpm) measured by bench test was 3.6% higher than that of the original engine using gasoline, the maximum torque was 1.7% lower, and the fuel consumption (in terms of heat) was saved by 15%. The maximum speed of the Liberation brand automobile modified with this compressed gas engine measured in road tests was 7 kilometers per hour higher than the original Liberation brand automobile using gasoline, the acceleration performance was improved, and the fuel consumption (in terms of heat) was saved by 26.3% when driving at a constant speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and 15.1% under urban driving conditions. However, if compressed gas vehicles are to be used, using coke oven gas or city gas as fuel, moisture and harmful impurities such as cyanic acid in the gas must be strictly removed. The heat content of the same volume of coke oven gas or city gas compressed to two hundred atmospheres is only about half that of natural gas and one-quarter that of liquefied methane. The amount of steel plates required for compressed gas cylinders is considerable. At the same time, coke oven gas and city gas are raw materials for nitrogen fertilizer, which is related to agricultural production. Which needs should these gases be supplied to first? It is suggested that relevant departments negotiate and decide as soon as possible.

    Due to the Development of the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement, There has Emerged a Situation of Output Increasing Several Times Over, and One Factory Equaling Several Factories

Since the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been launched, there has emerged a situation of output increasing several times over, and one factory equaling several factories. In this unprecedented Great Leap Forward situation, the emergence of new imbalances is foreseeable. In order for the flowers of technical innovation to fully bear fruit, the people of the whole country should do everything possible to overcome possible bottlenecks. Increasing production and conserving raw materials is of great significance. It must not be forgotten that increasing production and conservation is an important goal of technical innovation. Premier Zhou's instructions at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress last year: Research directly serving production and construction should be given priority. In the current situation, this is even more the guideline for all academic activities of our science and technology workers.

Inspired by the recent technical innovation and technical revolution movement, I deeply realize that only under the wise leadership of the Party can a mass, organized technical innovation and technical revolution movement emerge. Because the masses have unconditional trust, support, and love for the Party, they can truly do whatever the Party points to. Because the working people personally experience that technical innovation liberates them from heavy manual labor, technical innovation has become an urgent demand of the working people. Because workers have a deep perceptual understanding of machines in their long-term work practice, workers can accurately aim at the goals of innovation and solve problems quickly and well, which is something that intellectuals cannot match and should make up for. Because this technical innovation is carried out in a three-way combination, cutting-edge technology is quickly reflected in the flowers of innovation. In the battle of technical innovation, everyone realizes that scientific research, combined with production practice, can exert the greatest efficiency. Intellectuals and workers working side by side can most effectively transform their thoughts and viewpoints.

New things need time to grow. The achievements in technical innovation need to be improved, enhanced, promoted, and consolidated through continuous innovation. Testing and comparing the achievements of the same variety in technical innovation, gathering the strengths of all, and eliminating the weaknesses of each, can improve all the achievements of technical innovation and gradually achieve perfection. The achievements in technical innovation should also be written into written materials after evaluation and improvement, so that they can be easily promoted and consolidated. The working masses urgently need reference materials in technical innovation and technical revolution, such as various main components commonly used in automation, such as starting, amplifying, measuring, remote control, and other mechanisms. Once the workers master these mechanisms, they can innovate technology more, faster, better, and more economically. There are also some workers who have not yet been able to master new technologies, so that the new technologies cannot fully exert their power. They need new knowledge to master the use, adjustment, maintenance, and upkeep of new technologies. Scientific and technological workers familiar with these technologies have the responsibility to write down their knowledge to help the working masses who urgently need it. Measures to increase production and save raw materials, such as the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, are a key to overcoming the bottlenecks encountered in the promotion movement. These types of documents are also urgently needed. These are all tasks that the societies within the scope of the Science and Technology Association should call on members to participate in. I am determined to join hands with scientific and technological workers across the country to invest in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and become a member of the battle. I am also determined to study Chairman Mao's works for a long time, so that my thoughts and views are consistent with those of the Party and always keep up with the development of the situation.

Please criticize and correct any errors in the above speech.

### 长春遍开技术革新之花  张德庆委员的发言

专栏：

    长春遍开技术革新之花
    张德庆委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护陈叔通副主席的第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。
    我来北京前参加了吉林省人委和省政协组织的在长春市的视察。现在想谈一些肤浅的体会和不成熟的意见。希望“抛砖引玉”，大家提出宝贵的意见，以供推进技术革新、技术革命运动的参考。
    工厂饭馆都有技术革新
    男工女工都有发明创造
    从春节开始，在吉林省委和长春市委领导下，在长春加紧展开了轰轰烈烈，影响深远的技术革新、技术革命运动，到现在全市不仅大量的笨重体力劳动已变为机械操作，而且各厂车间的面貌还在天天革新。
    这个运动在长春开展的特点是革新的面广，参加的人认识到这个运动对自身有密切关系。非但大厂有技术革新、技术革命，而且中、小厂也向自动化进军。非但老工人有发明创造，而且女工和青年工人在技术革新中的贡献也硕果累累。大家不是单干，而是很好地发挥了领导人员、工人群众、技术人员三者结合的作用。非但工业生产上应用了新技术；而且尖端技术和日常生活也结合了起来。长春有一个崭新的大厂，在展开技术革新运动以来，自动生产线增加了一百多条，产量翻了四番，还在增加。长春卷烟厂的职工解放了思想，创造了自动设备，包括包装机，把这个厂的生产设备，从上料开始至包装完毕，联接成了一条完整的自动生产线。最使人振奋的是群众真正发扬了敢想、敢做和科学态度相结合的共产主义风格。长春饭店采用了尖端技术，为顾客服务。他们把重体力劳动机械化、自动化了。原来一人送饭、送菜，一天上下楼梯要走六、七十里路；现在送饭、送菜自动化了。原来拌一袋面粉要二十多分钟，现在这道工作机械化了，时间缩短到四分钟，淘米、切菜、做花卷、包饺子，都机械化了。在机械化淘米过程中，砂粒的清除，比手淘还要彻底。售烧饼、豆浆等，是自动化的，顾客只要投入相当于烧饼或豆浆价格的该店自备的铜元，售货机即会自动发出等价的烧饼或豆浆。顾客如要洗手，只须开启自来水龙头，煤气即自动点着，流出的水，温度恰好适宜于洗手。当顾客走向餐厅，到达门前，光电操纵机构，自动把门开启，让顾客进入餐厅。实现热能综合利用之后，回收的蒸汽出售所得，超过了消耗的煤的价值。这些技术革新的要求都是长春饭店的工作同志自己提出的，绝大部分机械化、自动化的机器也是店内的工作同志自行设计和制造的。应用尖端技术的部分是三结合创造的。长春秀丽粮店共有六名女工作人员，有的文盲，有的小学程度，只有一名有初中一年程度。在思想解放之后，她们决心要搞一人遥控全部货品的磅称和发售。她们获得了党的支持和科技工作者的协助，终于实现了遥远控制大米、高粱、小米等粒状粮食及液体物品的磅称和发售。
    随着技术革新来了生产的更大跃进。劳动力紧张和设备不足有所缓和，运输效率有所提高；生产成本逐渐下降。国家可用较多的投资，发展尖端技术。原料的综合利用扩大了材料来源，机械操作代替了笨重体力劳动，劳动条件大大改善，学习文化、技术的效率因而提高。在技术革新的战斗中培养了无产阶级的科学队伍，在技术革新的实践中全国人民更加发扬了敢想、敢做结合科学态度和大协作的共产主义风格，为进一步发展技术革新、技术革命，创造了有利条件。人们更清楚地认识到在社会主义国家里，劳动人民创造机器，以改善劳动条件，在资本主义国家里，资本家把劳动人民当作机器奴役，因而提高了觉悟。这一切，保证了1960年的更大跃进。
    原料、材料的增产和节约，是大跃进中的关键问题，应当视作技术革新中的重要环节
    在随着技术革新而来的大跃进形势下，天然生长的原料的增长势难跟上劳动生产率。因此，原料、材料的增产、节约，仍是一个大跃进中的关键性问题，应当视作技术革新中的重要环节。就我本行汽车工业论，凡是可能扩大燃料资源，节约原料、材料的措施，我觉得，不论已否有人采用，都应当研究，并且在有利的条件下加以利用。举例来说：
    一、发生炉煤气可以代替汽油，而且是一个可以广泛推广的资源。随着煤综合利用的发展，我国将生产逐渐增长的半焦。但是要充分利用半焦，作为内燃机的燃料，首先应当研究半焦在煤气发生炉中的最适宜的气化速度，即研究能使内燃机发出最大平均有效压力的，通过发生炉气化层的气流速度，米／秒。这个研究应当根据我国最主要的半焦进行。测定了半焦的最适宜的气化速度，就可以根据煤气机的排量与转数，决定发生炉的尺寸。这是扩大内燃机燃料资源的一个重要方面。研究了这个课题，可以避免很大的无形浪费。
    二、内燃机内喷水可以在不同条件下节省不同程度的燃料。六十余年来不断有人研究，但尚未摸透。初期在煤气机中喷水是为避免预燃。据国外发表的资料，用同一种汽油，在汽油机中喷水一般可以提高压缩比一个单位，在同时调整点火到最有利的提前角条件下，可以提高公升功率11％，节省燃料10％左右。据苏联发表的资料，吉斯——5汽车发动机在汽车上作长期道路试验中因喷水而节省的汽油达33％。柴油机中预先用喷嘴把柴油乳化之后，喷入汽缸，可以改善喷雾，同时可以内冷却代替部分的水箱冷却。如掺水量适当，排气温度不致降低，水箱热量的减少，相应于掺水量的汽化热。选择燃烧室垣壁温度较高，润滑油易于焦化的柴油机，作为喷水的对象，可以节约较多的柴油，并且延长润滑油的使用期限。
    所喷的水须经软化，以防产生锅石。喷水要在吸气（或喷油）行程或压缩行程的前期进行。停车前先要停止喷水。长期停车要采取防锈措施。
    三、在汽车上采用液化甲烷，比较用压缩天然煤气可以节省钢材。把天然煤气降温到零下约一百二十二度，可得液化甲烷。用它作汽车燃料比较用二百大气压的天然气可以降低压缩到十个大气压，降低储气瓶重量五分之四，扩大行程一倍，并且提高使用的安全性。液化甲烷需要保温；我国生产的硬泡沫是极好的保温材料，现在我国用作铁路客车的保温和隔音材料。
    四、焦炉煤气与城市煤气的最有利用途需要进一步考虑。根据最近在上海试验汽车采用压缩焦炉煤气的结果，解放牌汽车的发动机，换用较适宜于燃烧焦炉煤气的汽缸盖后，用台架试验测得的最大功率（2400转／分）较原发动机用汽油时大3.6％，最大扭矩小1.7％，燃料消耗（以热量计）节省15％；改用这种压缩煤气机的解放牌汽车在道路试验中测得的最大车速比原解放牌汽车用汽油大7公里／小时，加速性能有所提高，以等速30公里／小时行驶时，燃料消耗（以热量计）节省26.3％，在市区行驶条件下，节省15.1％。但如要采用压缩煤气车，用焦炉煤气或城市煤气作为燃料，必须严格清除煤气中的水分及氰酸等有害杂质。等容积的，压缩到二百大气压的焦炉煤气，或城市煤气，所含的热量约只有天然煤气的一半、液化甲烷的四分之一。压缩煤气瓶需要的钢板数量颇可观。同时焦炉煤气和城市煤气是有关农业增产的氮肥的原料。这些煤气首先宜供应那方面的需要，建议有关部门从速协商决定。
      由于技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，出现了产量翻几番、一厂顶数厂的局面
    自从技术革新、技术革命运动开展以来，已经出现了产量翻几番，一厂顶几厂的局面。在这空前大跃进的形势下，出现新的不平衡是可以预料的。为了让技术革新的花朵充分结果，全国人民应当尽一切力量，克服可能出现的瓶颈。增产、节约原料、材料，有着十分重要的意义。不可忘掉，增产、节约是技术革新的一个重要目标。去年周总理在二届一次人代会上的指示：直接为生产建设服务的研究，应当放在首要地位。在目前形势下，更是我们科技工作者的一切学术活动的指针。
    在最近的技术革新、技术革命运动的启示下，我深刻体会到，只有在党的英明领导下才能出现群众性的、有组织的技术革新和技术革命运动。因为群众对党有着无条件的信任、拥护和爱戴，所以能真正做到，党指向哪里，就做到那里。因为劳动人民亲身体会到技术革新把自己从笨重体力劳动中解放了出来，所以技术革新成为劳动人民的迫切要求。因为工人在长期工作实践中对机器有着深刻的感性认识，所以工人对革新的目标瞄得准，解决得快，解决得好，这是知识分子所比不上而应当补课的。因为这次技术革新是三结合进行的，所以革新花朵中很快反映了尖端技术，在技术革新的战斗中大家体会到科学研究，结合了生产实际，才能发挥最大的效率。知识分子和工人在工作中并肩作战，能最有效地改造自己的思想和观点。
    新生事物需要成长的时间。技术革新中的成就需要在不断革新中加以改进、提高、推广和巩固。把技术革新中同品种的成就进行试验、比较，集合众长，各去其短，可以使技术革新的成就都有所提高，逐步达于完善。技术革新中的成就，经过评比、提高以后，还应当写成书面材料，才便于推广、巩固。工人群众在技术革新、技术革命中，迫切需要参考资料，如自动化中常用的各种主要原件，如发动、加力、测量、遥控等机构，工人掌握了这些机构，就可以多、快、好、省地革新技术。还有一部分工人群众一时还未能掌握新技术，以至新技术不能充分发挥力量。他们需要新的知识去掌握新技术的使用、调整、维修、保养。熟悉这些技术的科技工作者，有责任把他们的知识写出来，帮助迫切需要它的工人群众。增产节约原料、材料的措施，如原料、材料的综合利用等，是克服推进运动中遇到的瓶颈的一个关键。这类文献也迫切需要。这些都是科协范围内的学会应当号召会员参加的工作。我决心和全国科技工作者一道，投入技术革新、技术革命运动，成为战斗的一员。我还决心要长期学习毛主席的著作，使自己的思想和观点同党的一致，永远跟上形势的发展。
    以上发言中错误的地方，请各位批评指正。
