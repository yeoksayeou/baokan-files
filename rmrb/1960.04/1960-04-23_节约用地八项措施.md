(From our Taiyuan dispatch on the 22nd) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee have issued eight specific measures for saving land and improving land utilization.

　　I. All cities and industrial and mining areas should conduct a general inspection of land use by government agencies, schools, and factories. Based on the vacant land of each unit, vegetable growing tasks should be assigned. When supplying these units, the self-sufficiency portion they are responsible for should be deducted. This year, from design to construction of basic construction projects in factories, enterprises, schools, and water conservancy, the concept of saving land must be established, and approval must be obtained from the local urban construction department in conjunction with the agricultural department. Land that has been requisitioned but is temporarily not in use should continue to be given to local people's communes for cultivation.

　　II. The construction of railways and highways should save land as much as possible. Simple rural roads should not be too wide at present. Old railway lines that have been requisitioned but not used, or abandoned after realignment, should be handed over to local people's communes for cultivation.

　　III. People's communes should conduct overall planning for the use of rural land. Land suitable for planting crops should generally not be converted into forest areas or pastures. Commune industries, residential areas, pigsties, etc., should occupy as little cultivated land as possible, especially not waterlogged or fertile land. Field roads should be based on meeting current production needs as a principle.

　　IV. Each management area should comprehensively plan all small plots of land in rural areas and assign them to production teams to plant feed and oil crops. Each production team should strive to be self-sufficient and have a surplus of feed.

　　V. Rural areas should mobilize residents to plant feed crops in front of and behind their houses; cities should mobilize residents to plant oil crops or vegetables in front of and behind their houses.

　　VI. Cultivated land that has been abandoned but not yet afforested or converted into grassland should be cultivated and utilized according to local conditions in a planned manner.

　　VII. Mountainous and hilly areas should organize specialized teams to repair field edges, build terraced fields, and renovate farmland. Alkaline areas should fix permanent alkali control teams to transform alkaline land in a planned manner.

　　VIII. All cities and rural people's communes should uniformly plan the location of soil extraction sites, and it is forbidden to extract soil within cultivated land.

    节约用地八项措施
    本报太原22日电　中共山西省委、山西省人民委员会发出了关于节约用地提高土地利用率的八项具体措施。
    一、所有城市和工矿区，对机关、学校、工厂的用地情况进行一次普遍检查，根据各单位的空闲地，分配种菜任务；对这些单位供应时，应扣去其所担负的自给部分。今年工厂企业、学校等部门及水利的基本建设，从设计到施工都要树立节约用地观点，并要经当地城市建设部门会同农业部门批准。征购土地后暂缓使用的，应当继续交给当地人民公社耕种。
    二、建筑铁路、公路要尽量节约用地。乡村的简易公路目前不宜过宽，铁道征而不用和改线后废弃了的旧线，应当交给当地人民公社耕种。
    三、农村土地的利用，各人民公社要进行全面规划。凡适宜种植农作物的土地，一般不改作林区、牧场。公社工业、居民点、猪圈等，尽可能不占、少占耕地，尤其不要占水地或肥沃土地。田间道路以适应当前生产需要为原则。
    四、各个管理区对农村所有的小块地，要全面规划，交给生产队种植饲料、油料。各个生产队的饲料，力争作到自足有余。
    五、农村要发动居民在房前屋后种植饲料；城市要发动居民在房前屋后种油料或蔬菜。
    六、已经弃耕而没有还林还草的耕地，要根据当地条件有计划的耕种利用。
    七、山地和丘陵区，要组织专门队伍修地边垒田堰，整修农田。碱地区要固定常年治碱队伍，有计划地改造碱地。
    八、各个城市和农村人民公社要统一规划取土地点，禁止在耕地内取土。
