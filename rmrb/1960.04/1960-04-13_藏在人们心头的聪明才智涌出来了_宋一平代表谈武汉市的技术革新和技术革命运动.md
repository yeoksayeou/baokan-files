Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I will now give a brief report to the conference on the situation of Wuhan's technical innovation and technical revolution movement (focusing on the situation of one factory).

	Plant Red Flags, Establish Models,
	Transmit "Experience" and Send "Treasures"

The people of Wuhan, like those all over the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, following the great victory of the anti-Rightist, boost-morale, and vigorous increase production and practice economy movement in 1959, began at the beginning of this spring with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm and drive, a magnificent and large-scale increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. From the very beginning, this movement has presented a situation of wave after wave, each wave higher than the last. Like a storm, it swept across all walks of life and every corner of the city with an overwhelming momentum: from industrial, agricultural, and transportation departments to commercial, financial, banking, and scientific, cultural, educational, and health departments, from senior engineering and technical personnel to ordinary manual laborers, from workers in large industries to women in the streets, an increasing number of people were involved in the torrent of the movement. Under the enlightenment and encouragement of Chairman Mao's great thought of breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and daring to think and act, they carried out creative labor with great revolutionary enthusiasm. They combined solid work, hard work, and clever work even better, combining production with invention and creation. They worked, thought, and experimented, everywhere "machine fanatics" engaged in innovation, everywhere warriors "not afraid of ghosts." Many people, in order to carry out an innovation, forgot to eat and sleep, traveled around, visited and learned, "seeking scriptures" and asking for advice, using their minds, finding tricks, designing themselves, finding raw materials themselves, and some even dismantled their beloved bicycles for experiments. Many people, with a tenacious fighting spirit, unafraid of difficulties and setbacks, attacked various technical barriers. Someone experimented with using chemical solutions to wash a relatively difficult-to-wash pipe, failed one hundred and six times, and still insisted on doing it, and finally succeeded. Our Party has greatly mobilized the intelligence hidden in the people, and the wisdom shown by all kinds of people in the movement is truly amazing! For example, the sewing machine, it seemed impossible to improve it, but our sewing industry workers have achieved fifty-eight major and minor innovations on the sewing machine head alone. People's communist style has been further developed, and learning, comparing, catching up, and helping each other have become the norm. Leaders at all levels have adopted methods such as planting red flags, establishing models, holding various on-site meetings, and holding various forms of "temple fair" exhibitions to widely promote advanced experiences and impart advanced technologies to promote the movement to advance by leaps and bounds. In short, the momentum of this movement, the speed of progress, the scope, and the effects are all unprecedented. The great mass revolutionary action of marching towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has shown a scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color. The following statistics can also reflect the initial achievements of this movement to some extent. According to incomplete statistics from early February to mid-March, the number of single-machine automatic and semi-automatic machine tools in the city increased from 3,218 to 5,024, the number of assembly lines increased from 1,272 to 2,482, the number of automatic assembly lines increased from 37 to 201, and 6,782 various indigenous and foreign equipment were self-made, liberating more than 66,700 people from manual labor and heavy physical labor, saving more than 32,300 labor force. Due to the development of the technical revolution movement, production plans have been completed even better. The city's total industrial output value in February exceeded the plan by 20.4%, and the average daily output value increased by 10.4% compared with the continued Great Leap Forward in the fourth quarter of 1959. The first quarter's industrial output value plan has been completed 9 days ahead of schedule, reaching 101.18%. At the same time, considerable achievements have also been made in climbing the peaks of cutting-edge technology. Such as program-controlled lathes, pulse-oriented fault detectors, electrical discharge machines, electrostatic flocking, transparent printing, viscose rayon, silk printing, white glue oil, and railway flaw detectors, etc., have all been successfully tested, and some have been officially put into production. During the movement, a group of units successively emerged in the city that were "one factory topping several factories, increasing production and saving manpower, first-class products, high, large, precise, and new, comprehensively catching up with the advanced, three reds and five bumper harvests" (ie, a good start, a complete success, and red to the end for the three reds, ideological, production, life, learning, and hygiene for the five bumper harvests). Here, I would like to take the Wuhan Oil Factory as an example for a more detailed introduction to illustrate the progress of the entire movement.

Old Oil Factory Makes Major Chemical Products

The Wuhan Oil Factory is a mechanical oil press with a history of more than 60 years, and now has 659 employees. Originally, the machinery and equipment were outdated, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization was only 35%, and the productivity was very low. The labor productivity in the early days of liberation in 1949 was only 2,879 yuan. In the past few years, a batch of equipment has been innovated and updated, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been increased to 72%, and the labor productivity has been increased to 28,512 yuan, which is ten times higher than in the early days of liberation. This spring, the workers of this factory enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and more actively invested in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. After a short period of more than a month of hard work, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization further increased to 92.35%, and the labor productivity increased to 40,000 yuan. The workers have basically been liberated from heavy physical labor. The face of this factory has undergone new and extremely profound changes. It has changed from a single oil press to an oil and fat chemical factory capable of producing a variety of chemical products. They broke through various technical barriers and vigorously carried out the comprehensive utilization and repeated utilization of cottonseed. For example, the fuzz on the cottonseed is scraped off to make raw materials for papermaking and rayon; cottonseed shells are used to produce the chemical raw material furfural, and the residue after furfural extraction is partly treated into high-grade potash fertilizer, and partly used to produce battery activated carbon and decolorizing activated carbon; the wastewater after furfural extraction is made into sodium acetate and anhydrous sodium acetate; the cotton oil squeezed from cottonseed is further refined into white glue oil, and the remaining oil foot is partly used for making soap and glycerin, and partly used for extracting fatty acids, oleic acid, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, synthetic petroleum, and industrial light oil and tung oil; the cottonseed cake after oil extraction is used to make liquid MSG, and the residue is used as feed. At present, the varieties of chemical products that have been successfully trial-produced and mostly put into production in this factory have reached 16. Through such comprehensive utilization and repeated utilization, the economic use value of cottonseed raw materials has been greatly improved, and many products have been provided for the chemical industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Taking one ton of cottonseed as an example, 155 kilograms of cotton oil, 430 kilograms of cake (640 kilograms of liquid MSG can be made from the cake), 55 kilograms of short velvet, 23 kilograms of furfural, 1.5 kilograms of oleic acid, 2.5 kilograms of stearic acid, 54 kilograms of decolorizing activated carbon, and 2.09 kilograms of sodium acetate can be produced. In this way, in addition to realizing zero-cost edible oil per ton of cottonseed, the country can also increase its wealth by more than 1,810 yuan. The total value of their production in February this year has doubled compared with the same period last year. According to the current production capacity, the total output value this year is expected to increase five times compared with last year and fifty-six times compared with 1949. In addition, their political and ideological education, spare-time study, non-staple food production, canteens, safe production, health care, and savings work are also well done. It is a factory that has truly realized the comprehensive leap forward of "three reds and five bumper harvests" called for by the provincial party committee.

The most fundamental reason why the Wuhan Oil Factory has been able to achieve such achievements is the result of following the leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and carrying out mass movements in a big way. From the very beginning, the Party organization of this factory firmly grasped ideological leadership, adopted the methods of vigorously explaining the situation, vigorously creating momentum, and conducting large-scale theoretical discussions and debates, extensively mobilizing the masses, and leading all the workers of the factory to further study the General Line, recognize the excellent situation, fully estimate the favorable conditions, and conduct debates around the questions of whether or not to implement the General Line, whether or not to change the face of the oil factory, whether or not to dare to revolutionize, and how to deal with the difficulties in the process of advancement. At the same time, the masses were organized to study Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire", and "On Contradiction" to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Through study and theoretical discussions, the consciousness of the cadres and workers of the entire factory has been further improved, breaking some people's various superstitious ideas about the chemical industry, and prompting them to be more eager to change the face of the factory through technical innovation. On the basis of this ideological movement, the factory Party committee timely proposed a combat call to march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, everyone contributes ideas, comprehensive utilization, self-reliance, and create more and better new products, and turn the oil factory into a modern oil and fat chemical factory. The masses expressed their determination and enthusiastically responded to this call with a fighting attitude. They said: "We must conquer the chemical technology fortress. No matter how difficult it is, it cannot defeat the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party. We will not give up until we reach the Yellow River, and we will not give up even after reaching the Yellow River." On the night of the mobilization report, Wang Jinyuan, the factory's red flag pacesetter, took the lead in moving his bedding to the workshop to sleep and pondered technical innovation day and night, and quickly designed and successfully manufactured equipment such as automatic balers. After get off work, young worker Chen Yuntang continued to fight into the depths of the night. The leaders mobilized him to go back to rest, took him out of the workshop, and locked the door, but he went in from the window, worked hard day and night, and quickly made a double-headed sawing machine. The preparation workshop and the repair workshop realized the vehicle transportation within five days. The factory Party committee seized these examples, held on-site meetings, planted red flags, established models (there are 20 red flag models and 61 advanced producers in the factory, and 79 people were commended), and vigorously promoted their daring and capable style. During the movement, the factory Party committee also timely organized a large number of workers and cadres to visit and study in other places, "seeking scriptures" and "borrowing the wind", learning when they saw advanced things, doing what they learned, learning and doing at the same time. At the same time, a spare-time secondary technical training class was also held in the factory to organize workers to learn technical knowledge related to machinery and oil and fat chemicals to improve their technical theoretical level. These have played an extremely important role in promoting the rapid development of the technical revolution movement in the entire factory. From the oil pressing workshop to the furfural workshop, the transportation of cottonseed shells was initially pushed by 15 people. The need for innovation is to realize pipeline-based automatic feeding, and to blow the cottonseed shells through pipelines by wind power, which requires a blower with a large wind power. Self-made, no confidence, ordering from outside? "Distant water cannot quench near thirst." What to do? The Party organization handed this problem over to the masses to find a solution. The masses' answer was to do it themselves. Facts have proved that the masses can not only do it, can do it, but also quickly make blowers that fully meet the specifications and realize the requirements of innovation. For example, the manufacture of liquid MSG, from visiting and learning to successful testing, only took ten days. These examples fully illustrate that once the masses' minds are mobilized, and the masses' wisdom is liberated, they are not afraid of anything, can do anything, and nothing can stop them, and they will create many unexpected miracles.

Learn Culture and "Borrow Ladders to Climb Upstairs"

The achievements of the Wuhan Oil Factory in carrying out the technical revolution are inseparable from carrying out the cultural revolution in a big way. In the early days of liberation, the average age of the workers in this factory was nearly 40 years old, and more than 85% of the workers were illiterate, which became an obstacle to improving technology and developing production. Therefore, the factory began to organize employees to learn culture from 1950 and has persisted until now. They became a blind factory as early as October 1958. At present, 100% of the factory employees continue to enroll in studies. In the technical revolution movement, the masses saw that the face of the factory was changing day by day, and the future was bright, and their enthusiasm for learning was even higher. More than 85% of the factory employees have now reached the point where they can master two to five skills at the same time. According to the standards of putting politics in command, having a cultural level above junior high school, mastering more than two skills, being able to initially design drawings, and being able to write summaries and plan economic indicators, 224 people have reached this level, accounting for 56% of the factory's production workers. The current educational level of the factory's workers is 25 college students, 48 high school students, 150 junior high school students, and 260 primary school students. Among the 84 cadres in the factory, 80% were trained from workers. Including eight of the nine Party committee members who were promoted from workers in the factory. Among the thirteen technical personnel in the factory, ten were trained from workers. Worker Wang Jinyuan only studied for one year in the old society. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, and through his own diligent study, he is now a student of a spare-time university. He has successively designed and led the creation of new equipment such as simple gantry planers, 1.5-meter vertical lathes, and automatic balers. People like Wang Jinyuan have appeared in batches in the factory. In short, the result of this factory's vigorous cultural revolution has played a great role in conquering the chemical fortress and developing the technical revolution. The Wuhan Oil Factory has set an example for all other factories and enterprises in this regard.

Combining production, adapting to local conditions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, self-reliance, making do with whatever is available, and using local materials are the 24-character guidelines that the Wuhan Oil Factory has always adhered to in carrying out the technical revolution movement. In order to achieve a high-speed leap forward, in the process of vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization and improving the level of production, the vast majority of production equipment is self-reliant, developing from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and from single items to "complete sets", step by step. In the work process, countless difficulties were overcome, ensuring that a variety of equipment was launched on schedule, and new products were put into production one after another. For example, when the oil refining workshop was manufacturing fatty acids, there were neither drawings nor materials. The workers went to other factories to learn, and then designed and manufactured themselves, found waste steel pots and old iron pipes to replace acid-resistant materials, and built stoves and installed equipment themselves, and as a result, fatty acids with good quality were produced. Up to now, on the basis of the original equipment, this factory has established a mechanized and automated processing line for comprehensive utilization of cottonseed, including production equipment for seed cotton ginning, cottonseed peeling, oil extraction, oil refining, and extraction of various chemical products. The workers themselves designed and manufactured more than 20 kinds of production equipment such as 10-ton spiral electric oil presses, welding machines, motors, and gantry planers, armed themselves, improved their production capacity, and made the factory's face change with each passing day.

The Wuhan Oil Factory also promoted the communist style of cooperation and implemented overall warfare and large-scale collaboration in the technical revolution movement. Their slogan is: "Our factory's warehouse is the warehouse of fraternal units." Under the guidance of such an idea, mutual cooperation between departments within the factory and between fraternal units has become a common practice. When the Nanyang Cigarette Factory lacked electricians and asked the Oil Factory for support, they called at 5 o'clock and sent someone there at 7 o'clock. When fraternal units lack steel plates, if our factory has them, we immediately support them. If our factory does not have them, we also assist fraternal units in contacting everywhere and try our best to solve the problem. In order to help the workers of the Hanyang Transport Station get rid of heavy physical labor, they used materials from our factory to make an electric winch on their behalf, and were responsible for installation until it was operating normally, which improved the efficiency of the transportation work by a hundred times. They also received material support from fraternal units. Workshops and departments within the factory actively cooperated. In the upsurge of the technical revolution, the repair workshop served the entire factory during production time to support the launch of technical innovation projects in fraternal workshops; and carried out its own technical innovation projects in spare time. In order to support the furfural workshop to quickly establish a liquid MSG production section, the branch secretary personally led a team to assist in the installation of machines. The department sends materials to the workshop, whenever they are needed, they are sent.

The employees of this factory are currently consolidating their achievements and advancing victoriously, further improving labor productivity, manufacturing new products, and aiming to catch up with the advanced level in the country.

New Machines Take the Stage, Backward Tools Enter the Museum

Judging from the situation in Wuhan, in the upsurge of the technical revolution, there are already many units like the Wuhan Oil Factory. For example, the Wuchang Round Wood Factory manufactured 17 kinds of 32 indigenous machines in just seven days, basically realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, and sent the backward tools such as axes, planes, chisels, and drills that have been passed down for thousands of years into the museum. The workers of the Hankou Bamboo Ware Factory themselves created 38 kinds of indigenous machines for splitting bamboo, marking bamboo, smoothing bamboo, opening bamboo, sawing bamboo, drilling holes, and raising the bottom, changing the backward state of manual production in the bamboo ware industry for thousands of years. The Wuhan Low-Pressure Boiler Factory, which was organized and developed from six handicraft production cooperatives more than a year ago and whose main production operations relied on heavy manual labor, was full of energy in this movement, and made 66 sets of equipment by itself. 45 of the factory's 48 processes have basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased sharply from the original 24% to 90%. They solved the technical problems that some modern large boiler factories have not solved. The newly built First Wuhan Knitting Factory self-made 122 various indigenous and foreign equipment during the movement, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization increased from the original 58% to 95.5%. As a result of the cooperation between the factory and the yarn factory, an entire yarn winding workshop will be saved. The modern Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang) Coking Plant broke the conservative idea that "foreign equipment has nothing to innovate" and realized a series of reforms, which doubled the production capacity of 13 large equipment. The speed of Wugang's basic construction has also reached a fairly amazing degree. They can install a 350-ton crane in 72 hours; it used to take three months, but now it only takes 12 days to build a 100-meter-high chimney. There are many units like the above, which cannot be listed here one by one, and with the deepening development of the technical revolution movement, they will continue to emerge more and more, which can be asserted.

In the process of the movement's advancement, new problems have also emerged. The most prominent problems are: the increased productivity requires an increasing number of raw materials, electricity, fuel, technical strength, and transportation vehicles; cadres and workers urgently need to improve their political and theoretical level, cultural level, and scientific and technical level in order to catch up with the new situation and master new technologies and new equipment. At the same time, the development of the entire movement is not balanced and not deep enough. Some factories have developed faster, while others have developed slower; the mass movement in some units is not widespread enough, and the new right-leaning fear of difficulties that have arisen under the new situation still needs to be further resolved. Consolidating, promoting, improving, and developing this movement still requires a lot of work. These problems are problems in the process of advancement, and we are working hard to solve them.

We, the people of Wuhan, under the leadership of the Party, will certainly hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and march forward with the people of the whole country, moving from victory to victory!

    藏在人们心头的聪明才智涌出来了
    宋一平代表谈武汉市的技术革新和技术革命运动主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理和人大常委的报告。我现在把武汉市开展技术革新和技术革命运动的情况（着重从一个工厂的情况出发），向大会作一个简要的汇报。
      插红旗，树标兵，
      传“经”送“宝”
    武汉市人民和全国各地一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想和总路线的光辉照耀下，继1959年反右倾、鼓干劲、开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动取得伟大胜利之后，紧接着又在本年初春，以更加高涨的革命热情和革命干劲，开始了一个气势磅礴、波澜壮阔的、以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。这个运动，一开始便呈现出一浪接一浪，一浪高一浪的形势，它像风暴一样，以排山倒海之势，席卷着全市的各行各业、各个角落：从工业、农业、交通运输部门到商业、财政、金融和科学文教卫生等部门，从高级的工程技术人员到普通的手工体力劳动者，从大工业的工人到街道的妇女，都日益众多地卷进了运动的洪流。他们在毛主席的破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢干的伟大思想的启示和鼓舞下，以巨大的革命热情进行着创造性的劳动，他们更好地把实干、苦干和巧干结合起来了，把生产和发明创造结合起来了，一边干、一边想、一边搞试验，到处是闹革新的“机器迷”，到处是“不怕鬼”的勇士。许多人为了搞一项革新，废寝忘食，四处奔走，参观学习，“取经”求教，用心机，找窍门，自己设计，自己找原材料，有的人不惜把自己心爱的脚踏车拆掉来搞试验。许多人以坚韧顽强的战斗精神，不怕困难和挫折，攻打着各种技术关。有人试验用化学药水洗一种比较难洗的管子，失败了一百零六次，仍然坚持着干，终于获得了成功。我们的党把蕴藏在人民群众中的聪明才智，大大地调动起来了，各种人物在运动中所表现出来的那么多的智慧，实在令人惊叹！例如像缝纫机，似乎不可能有什么改进了，但是我们的缝纫业工人，仅在缝纫机的机头上，就实现了五十八项大大小小的革新。人们的共产主义风格更加发扬，学、比、赶、帮，相互支援已成为风气。各级领导上采取大插红旗，广树标兵，召开各种现场会议，举办各种形式的“庙会”展览会等办法，广泛推广先进经验，传授先进技术，以推动运动阔步前进。总之，这个运动的来势之猛，进展之速，范围之广，效果之大，都是空前的。向机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化进军的伟大群众革命行动，已经呈现出百花齐放、万紫千红的局面。下列统计数字也可以多少反映这个运动所取得的初步成就。据自2月上旬至3月中旬这段时间不完全的统计，全市单机自动、半自动机台已由三千二百一十八台增加为五千零二十四台，流水作业线由一千二百七十二条增加为二千四百八十二条，自动流水作业线由三十七条增加为二百零一条，自制各种土、洋设备六千七百八十二台，从手工操作和笨重体力劳动中解放出来六万六千七百多人，节省出劳动力三万二千三百多人。由于技术革命运动的发展，生产计划完成得更好了。全市2月份工业总产值比计划超额完成20.4％，平均日产值比继续大跃进的1959年第四季度增加了10.4％。第一季度工业总产值计划已经提前九天完成101.18％。同时，在攀登尖端技术的高峰方面，也取得了不少成就，像程序控制车床、脉冲定向故障探测仪、电火花机、静电植绒、透明印花、粘胶人造丝、丝绸印花、白皎油，以及铁路探伤仪等等，都已试验成功，有的并已正式投入生产。在运动中，全市相继出现了一批“一厂顶数厂，增产又节人，产品第一流，高大精尖新，全面赶先进，三红五丰收”（即开门红、满堂红、红到底三红，思想、生产、生活、学习、卫生五丰收）的单位。在这里，我想举武汉油厂为例，加以较详细的介绍，用以说明整个运动的进展情况。
    老油厂大搞化工产品
    武汉油厂是一个有六十多年历史的机榨油厂，现在有职工六百五十九人。原来机器设备陈旧，机械化半机械化程度只有35％，生产力很低，1949年解放初期的劳动生产率只有二千八百七十九元，几年来革新与更新了一批设备，机械化半机械化程度提高到72％，劳动生产率提高到二万八千五百一十二元，比解放初期增长了十倍。今年春，这个厂的职工热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，更加积极投入以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，经过短短一个多月的奋战，机械化半机械化程度进而提高到92.35％，劳动生产率提高到四万元，工人基本上从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。这个厂的面貌已发生了新的极其深刻的变化，它已经从一个单一的榨油厂变为能够生产多种化学产品的油脂化学工厂了。他们突破各种技术关，大搞棉籽的综合利用和反复利用。如把棉籽上的绒刮下来做造纸和人造纤维的原料；棉籽壳生产化工原料糠醛，提炼糠醛后剩下的渣，一部分处理成为高级钾肥，一部分用来生产电池活性炭和脱色活性炭；提炼糠醛后的废水制成醋酸钠和无水醋酸钠；将棉籽榨出来的棉油进一步精炼成白皎油，留下的油脚一部分用作制肥皂、甘油，一部分提炼脂肪酸、油酸、硬脂酸、硬脂酸镁、人造石油和工业用的光油、洪油；榨油后的棉饼用来做液体味精，残渣作饲料。目前，这个厂已试制成功并已大部投入生产的化学产品品种已达十六种。经过这样的综合利用和反复利用，大大提高了棉籽原料的经济使用价值，为化学工业和医药工业提供了不少产品。以一吨棉籽来说，就可产棉油一百五十五公斤，饼四百三十公斤（用饼可做液体味精六百四十公斤），短绒五十五公斤，糠醛二十三公斤，油酸一点五公斤，硬脂酸二点五公斤，脱色活性炭五十四公斤，醋酸钠二点零九公斤。这样，每吨棉籽除了实现食油无成本外，还可为国家多增加一千八百一十多元的财富。他们今年2月份的生产总值，已比去年同期翻了一番。根据目前生产能力计算，今年总产值预计可以比去年翻五番，比1949年翻五十六番。此外，他们的政治思想教育、业余学习、副食品生产、食堂、安全生产、卫生保健、节约储蓄等工作也搞得好，是一个真正实现了省委号召的“三红五丰收”的全面跃进的厂子。
    武汉油厂之所以能够取得这样的成绩，最根本的原因是遵循党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果。这个厂的党组织一开始就紧紧抓住了思想领导，采取了大讲形势，大造声势，大务虚大辩论的办法，广泛发动群众，领导全厂职工进一步学习总路线，认清大好形势，足够估计有利条件，围绕执不执行总路线？要不要改变油厂面貌？敢不敢革命？如何对待前进中的困难等问题，开展辩论。同时，组织群众学习毛主席关于“愚公移山”、“星星之火，可以燎原”及“矛盾论”等著作，用毛泽东思想武装群众。通过学习务虚，全厂干部和工人的觉悟更加提高了，打破了一些人对化学工业的各种迷信思想，促使他们对技术革新要求改变本厂的面貌的心情更加急迫了。厂党委就在这样思想运动的基础上及时提出向机械化半机械化进军，人人献计，综合利用，自力更生，创造更多更好的新产品，把油厂变成一个现代化的油脂化学工厂的战斗号召，群众纷纷表示决心，以战斗姿态热烈响应了这个号召。他们说：“一定要攻克化工技术堡垒，再困难也难不倒共产党领导下的工人阶级，不到黄河心不死，到了黄河也不死心。”动员报告的当天晚上，厂红旗标兵王金元即带头将被子搬到车间睡觉，日夜琢磨技术革新，很快地设计成功自动打包机等设备。青工陈云堂下班后连续战斗到深夜，领导上动员他回去休息，把他带出车间，并将门锁上，他又从窗户中进去了，夜以继日地艰苦奋战，很快制成双头锯床。准备车间和修造车间在五天内即实现了运输车子化。厂党委抓住这些事例，召开现场会议，大插红旗，大树标兵（在全厂共有红旗标兵二十个，先进生产者六十一个，受到表扬的七十九个），大张旗鼓地提倡他们这种敢想敢干的风格。在运动中，厂党委还及时组织了大批工人和干部到外地参观学习，“取经”、“借风”，见先进就学，学了就干，边学边干。同时，在厂内还举办了业余中等技术训练班，组织工人学习有关机械和油脂化学等技术知识，以提高他们的技术理论水平。这些，都对全厂技术革命运动的迅速发展起了极其重要的促进作用。从榨油车间到糠醛车间，运棉籽壳开始是由十五个人推。需要革新，办法就是实现管道化的自动送料，通过风力将棉籽壳经过管道吹运过去，这就需要有一部风力较大的鼓风机鼓风。自制吧，没有把握，到外地订货吗？“远水不能救近火”。怎么办？党组织把这个问题交给群众想办法，群众的答复是自己干。事实证明群众不仅能干、会干，而且很快就干出了完全合乎规格的鼓风机来，实现了革新的要求。又如液体味精的制造，从参观学习到试验成功，前后也只花了十天时间。这些事例充分说明：群众的思想一经发动，群众的智慧一经解放出来，他们就什么也不怕，什么也能干，什么也难不住他们，就会创造出许多意想不到的奇迹来。
    学文化“借梯子上楼”
    武汉油厂大搞技术革命的成就是和大搞文化革命分不开的。解放初期，这个厂的工人平均年龄近四十岁，85％以上的工人都是文盲，成为提高技术、发展生产的障碍。因此，厂里从1950年起即开始组织职工学习文化，一直坚持到现在。他们早在1958年10月就成了无盲工厂。目前全厂职工继续100％的入学学习。在技术革命运动中，群众看到工厂的面貌一天天在改变，前途一片光明，学习情绪更加高涨。全厂职工现在已有85％以上的人达到能同时掌握两至五种技能。按照政治挂帅、初中以上文化水平、掌握两种以上技术、能初步设计绘图、能写总结和计划经济指标等标准考核，达到这种水平的已有二百二十四人，占全厂生产工人的56％。该厂工人目前的文化程度有大学生二十五人，高中生四十八人，初中生一百五十人，小学生二百六十人。全厂八十四个干部中，从工人中培养出来的占80％。包括九个党委委员中有八个是从本厂工人中提拔起来的。全厂十三个技术人员中，有十个是从工人中培养出来的。工人王金元在旧社会只读了一年书，解放后在党的培养下，经过自己勤学苦钻，现在已是业余大学的学生。他曾先后设计并领导创造了简易龙门刨床、一点五米立方式车床和自动打包机等新设备。像王金元这样的人，在厂内已经成批出现。总之，这个厂大搞文化革命的结果，为攻克化工堡垒和发展技术革命起了很大作用。武汉油厂在这方面为一切其他的工厂、企业树立了榜样。
    结合生产，因地制宜，土洋并举，自力更生，因陋就简，就地取材，这是武汉油厂开展技术革命运动始终坚持的二十四字方针。为了实现高速度跃进，这个厂在大搞综合利用、提高生产水平的过程中，绝大多数生产设备都是自力更生，从土到洋、从小到大、从单项到
  “成龙配套”，逐步发展起来的。在工作过程中克服了数不清的困难，保证了多种设备按时上马，新产品一个接一个地投入生产。如炼油车间在制造脂肪酸时，既无图纸，又缺材料，工人们到外厂学习，回来后就自己动手设计，自己到处找废钢锅、旧铁管代替耐酸材料，自己动手砌炉灶、安装设备，结果制成了质量良好的脂肪酸来。到目前为止，这个厂在原有设备基础上，以棉籽为中心，已经建立了一条综合利用棉籽的机械化、自动化加工生产线，包括籽棉轧花、棉籽剥绒、榨油、炼油以及提炼多种化工产品等生产设备。工人自己设计、自己制造出了十吨螺旋电动榨油机、电焊机、马达、龙门刨床等二十多种生产设备，武装了自己，提高了生产能力，使工厂的面貌日新月异地改变着。
    武汉油厂在技术革命运动中还大兴共产主义协作之风，实行总体战，大协作。他们的口号是：“我们厂的仓库，就是兄弟单位的仓库。”在这样一个思想指导之下，厂内各部门之间、和兄弟单位之间，相互协作蔚然成风。南洋烟厂缺电工，要求油厂支援，五点钟来电话，七点钟就派人去了。兄弟单位缺乏钢板，本厂有的，立即支援，本厂没有的，还协助兄弟单位到处联系，尽量解决。为了协助汉阳搬运站工人摆脱笨重体力劳动，用本厂材料，代做了一部电动卷扬机，并负责安装，一直到运转正常，使搬运工作提高效率一百倍，他们也从兄弟单位得到了物资支援。厂内车间与车间、科室与车间主动协作。在技术革命高潮中，修造车间在生产时间内为全厂生产服务，支援兄弟车间技术革新项目上马；将本身的技术革新项目放在业余时间进行。炼油车间为了支援糠醛车间迅速建立液体味精生产工段，支部书记亲自带队去协助安装机器。科室送材料下车间，什么时候要，就什么时候送。
    这个厂的职工，目前正在巩固成绩的基础上，乘胜前进，进一步提高劳动生产率，制造新产品，向全国先进水平看齐。
    新机器上台，落后工具进博物馆
    从武汉市情况看，在技术革命的热潮中，类似武汉油厂这样的单位，已经不少了。如武昌园木厂在短短的七天内，就制成了十七种三十二部土机器，基本上实现了机械化半机械化，将千年流传下来的斧、刨、凿、钻等落后工具送进了博物馆。汉口篾器厂工人自己创造了劈篾、划篾、匀篾、开竹、锯竹、钻眼、起底等三十八种土机器，改变了千年来篾器行业手工生产的落后状态。一年多以前由六个手工业生产合作社组织和发展起来的主要生产操作靠笨重手工劳动的武汉低压锅炉厂，在这次运动中干劲十足，自制了六十六台设备，全厂四十八道工序已有四十五道工序基本上实现了机械化半机械化，机械化半机械化程度由原来24％猛增至90％。有些现代化的大锅炉厂都没有解决的技术问题，他们解决了。新建的第一武汉针织厂，在运动中自制各种土洋设备一百二十二台，机械化、半机械化程度即由原来58％提高到95.5％。该厂与纱厂协作的结果，一个倒纱车间将全部省掉。现代化的武钢焦化厂破除了“洋设备没有什么可以革新”的保守思想，实现了一系列的改革，使十三项大型设备生产能力翻了一番。武钢基本建设的速度也达到了相当惊人的程度，他们能在七十二小时之内安装一部三百五十吨的吊车；过去需要三个月现在只十二天就筑成一座一百米高的烟囱。像以上这类的单位，还有很多，这里不能一一列举了，并且随着技术革命运动的深入发展，将会不断地、愈来愈多地涌现出来，这是可以断言的。
    在运动的前进过程中，新的问题也出现了，最突出的问题是：提高了的生产力，要求日益增多的原材料、电力、燃料、技术力量和交通工具；干部与工人迫切需要提高政治理论水平、文化水平和科学技术水平，以赶上新的形势，掌握新技术和新设备。同时，整个运动的发展还不够平衡、不够深入。有的厂发展较快、有的厂发展较慢；有些单位的群众运动面还不广泛，在新形势下产生的新的右倾畏难情绪还需要进一步解决。巩固、推广、提高和发展这一运动，尚需进行许多工作。这些问题都是前进中的问题，我们正在努力解决。
    我们武汉市人民，在党的领导下，一定更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗和全国人民一道，阔步前进，从胜利走向胜利！
