Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national accounts and the 1960 draft national budget, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and Vice Chairman Chen Shuton's work report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference. The 1960 national economic plan is a magnificent and splendid plan for continued great leaps forward based on two consecutive years of great leaps forward. It is a comprehensive plan for building socialism at high speed and a plan for laying the foundation for sustained leaps forward throughout the 1960s. The 1960 national budget is a budget to ensure the over-fulfillment of the national economic plan, with more than 80% of the investment going to economic and cultural construction. Therefore, it is also a great budget for peaceful construction, a solemn answer to the false peace and real war preparations of American imperialism. I feel infinitely excited and encouraged by these two reports and will resolutely implement them in my work.

Just as Vice Premier Li Fuchun summarized in his report on the achievements of the continued great leap forward in 1959, our Shanghai Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory's tire production increased by 48.5% on the basis of the 1958 leap forward, reaching fifty times the output of 1949. Labor productivity increased by 53%, and the planned output value for 1960 will increase by more than 40% on the basis of 1959, continuing to leap forward like all parts of the country. To support agriculture, we plan to further increase the variety and production of tractor tires this year. The achievement of these results is entirely inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party and the increase production and practice economy movement carried out under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune – the three red banners. This once again demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party Committee, our factory has launched a vigorous and comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which is being carried out more broadly and deeply. Achievements are constantly emerging. In 1959, a total of 442 technical innovations and technical revolutions were achieved, while by March 10 this year, 534 had been completed, exceeding the total for last year by more than 20%. In particular, after the Party Committee called for a mechanization and semi-mechanization movement to eliminate manual labor in early March, 140 items were completed in three days, basically eliminating manual labor and increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from about 65% at the beginning of the year to more than 97%. This year, in less than three months, 40 large and small transmission lines have been completed, further changing the face of the enterprise, greatly increasing labor productivity, reducing labor intensity, and saving labor. The saved labor force has been used to support the construction of the synthetic rubber factory. Now, all the employees of our factory are in high spirits and are marching towards automation and semi-automation, striving to transform our factory into an automated and semi-automated factory within the year. This fully demonstrates that Vice Premier Li Fuchun's call to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in depth and comprehensively is completely correct.

The 1960 national economic plan points out the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and taking steel as the key link in industry and grain as the key link in agriculture, making comprehensive arrangements. This is a comprehensive policy for better continued leap forward. It specifically points out the direction of strengthening the construction of the synthetic rubber industry and developing synthetic rubber production, satisfying the ardent wishes of the people of the whole country. As a technical personnel in the rubber industry, I feel unspeakable joy and encouragement. This is announcing to the world that our country also has a synthetic rubber industry. Since liberation, our rubber industry has been developing rapidly with the development of the national economy, the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production and transportation, and the continuous improvement of science and technology. The demand for products is increasing, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Due to the high development of heavy industry, the aviation industry, the automobile industry, cutting-edge technology, etc., rubber products not only cannot meet the needs in quantity, but also cannot meet the increasingly high requirements in certain properties, such as oil resistance, high temperature resistance, aging resistance, and air permeability. Natural rubber cannot meet these requirements, while synthetic rubber can have the above properties. The development of the synthetic rubber industry in our country precisely illustrates the improvement of our industrial level. At the same time, it marks a new stage in the development of our rubber industry, which is a great happy event in the history of our rubber industry, enabling our country to develop from the rubber processing industry to the rubber production industry, which is a new stage with great significance. This makes me realize that:

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, the rubber industry has made rapid development, and the products have reached more than 20,000 kinds, basically meeting the needs of the national economy. However, due to the fact that the reactionaries did not pay attention to the cultivation of natural rubber before liberation, it basically relied on imports. Although large-scale cultivation has been carried out since liberation, due to the limitations of natural conditions, the output of natural rubber still cannot meet the increasing needs, and most of it still needs to be imported. Therefore, the production potential of the rubber industry is constrained and cannot be fully utilized, so the speed of the leap forward is also limited to a certain extent. The development of the synthetic rubber industry can be free from the limitations of natural conditions. At the same time, the production of synthetic rubber can supplement the shortcomings of natural rubber in performance, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the rubber industry, thereby laying the foundation for the continuous leap forward in meeting the increasing needs of industry and agriculture, transportation, and people's daily necessities.

Since the growth rate of natural rubber production in our country cannot keep up with the development speed of the rubber industry and cannot meet the production needs, a large amount of natural rubber still needs to be imported every year, consuming a large amount of foreign exchange. Therefore, the construction of the synthetic rubber industry not only implements the policy of self-reliance, but also saves foreign exchange and meets the needs of the national economy, which has important economic significance. More importantly, rubber is a strategic material, one of the important materials for the defense industry. Since liberation, American imperialism has been adopting various conspiracies to blockade, monopolize, and prevent various rubber producing countries from exporting to our country, attempting to undermine our socialist construction. Recently, it has instigated Indonesia to oppose China and discriminate against Chinese and attempt to monopolize the rubber trade and discriminate against raising prices. Therefore, the development of the synthetic rubber industry in our country is part of the anti-imperialist struggle and a heavy blow to the blockade and sabotage of American imperialism, so it also has particularly important political significance. At the same time, the development of the synthetic rubber industry also marks that our country's industrial technology level has caught up with the international level, which is of great significance for catching up with and surpassing the industrial production level of the United Kingdom ahead of schedule.

According to the climatic and geographical conditions of our country, rubber trees can be cultivated in large quantities in the southern provinces to meet the needs for natural rubber resources. However, rubber trees generally need to grow for six or seven years before rubber can be harvested. Although the rubber tapping period has been shortened through continuous improvement after liberation, it still takes four or five years. Therefore, although large-scale cultivation has been carried out, it still cannot keep up with the current situation of the leap forward. The production of synthetic rubber, from infrastructure construction to putting into production, can take less than a year according to the speed of industrial development in our country, and is not restricted by natural conditions such as climate and soil. Therefore, on the one hand, we should use the natural conditions of our country, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, to strengthen the cultivation of natural rubber to gradually meet the needs for natural rubber. On the other hand, we should actively develop the construction and production of synthetic rubber at the same time, which not only meets the urgent needs of the current national economy, but also meets the special needs of the high development of industry and agriculture, which is completely in line with the spirit of the general line of a complete set of two-legged walking and simultaneous development.

The raw materials for manufacturing synthetic rubber mainly include potatoes (agricultural products), sawdust, coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc., all of which our country has sufficient and abundant resources. In particular, in the past two years of continuous great leaps forward, these materials have also greatly increased production, creating favorable conditions for synthetic rubber raw materials. Due to the development of the synthetic rubber industry, these resources can be fully utilized, especially the comprehensive utilization of coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc., has expanded the scope. On the one hand, the spirit of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor is implemented, and on the other hand, the policy of strengthening the comprehensive utilization of natural resources is implemented.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, rubber industries and research units all over the country have enthusiastically carried out experimental research work on synthetic rubber, and most areas have established experimental factories. For more than a year, under the leadership of the Party, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, a series of difficulties have been overcome, and great achievements have been made. The production technology of synthetic rubber has been preliminarily enriched and mastered, and a large number of technical forces and production backbones have been trained. In the research process, we have constantly received the selfless help of the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to produce synthetic rubber. The current situation is so good, the conditions are so available, coupled with the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the correct leadership of the Party, and the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune for building socialism at high speed, we have full confidence that we will be able to complete the Party's call, completely overcome all difficulties, and develop the synthetic rubber industry at high speed.

Our rubber industry is now entering a new historical stage. As a rubber technician, under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party for ten years, my ideological awareness has been greatly improved, but it is still far from keeping up with the development of the situation, and I have not completely broken with the bourgeois stand and world outlook. Therefore, I must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, study and master Mao Zedong Thought, learn the communist style of the working class, continue to strengthen the thorough transformation of the bourgeois stand and world outlook, establish the ideological will to serve socialism, improve the ability to work for socialism, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan and develop the synthetic rubber industry, and contribute all our strength.

Please correct me if anything is inappropriate above.

    高速度发展合成橡胶工业
    刘学文委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理的为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告，及陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。1960年的国民经济计划是在两年连续大跃进的基础上的一个宏伟庄丽的继续大跃进的计划，是一个高速度建设社会主义的全面计划，亦是一个为整个六十年代持续跃进奠定基础的计划。1960年的国家预算则是保证国民经济计划超额完成的预算，其中80％以上的投资为经济文化建设，所以又是一个伟大的和平建设的预算，对美帝国主义的假和平真备战是一个庄严的回答，这两个报告，我感到无限兴奋和鼓舞，一定坚决贯彻到我的工作中去。
    正像李富春副总理在报告中所总结的1959年继续大跃进的成绩一样，我们上海大中华橡胶厂的轮胎生产又在1958年跃进的基础上增产了48.5％，达到了1949年产量的五十倍，劳动生产率提高了53％，而1960年计划产值将在1959年的基础上增加40％以上，与全国各地一样地继续跃进。为了支援农业，我们今年规划进一步增加拖拉机轮胎的品种和生产。这些成绩的获得，完全是与党的正确领导和在八届八中全会的号召下开展了技术革新和技术革命的增产节约运动分不开的，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的总路线大跃进人民公社三面红旗的伟大胜利，又一次说明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    今年以来，我们厂在党委的领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的全面的技术革新技术革命运动，并正在更广泛更深入地开展着，成绩不断地出现着，1959年全年实现的技术革新技术革命有四百四十二项，而今年到3月10日就完成了五百三十四项，超过了去年全年的20％以上，特别是在3月上旬党委号召开展机械化半机械化运动消灭手工劳动以后，三天内就完成了一百四十项，基本上消灭了手工劳动，使机械化半机械化的程度，从年初的65％左右提高到97％以上，今年在不到三个月时间内完成了大小传动线四十条，进一步改变了企业面貌，大大提高了劳动生产率，减轻了劳动强度，节约了劳动力；把节约的劳动力支援了合成橡胶厂的建设，现在我们厂全厂职工意气风发，正在向自动化半自动化进军，争取在年内把我们厂改造成为一个自动化半自动化的工厂，充分说明了李富春副总理号召深入地全面地开展技术革新技术革命运动的完全正确。
    1960年国民经济计划中指出了以农业为基础以工业为主导，和工业以钢为纲，农业以粮为纲全面安排的方针，是一个全面地更好地继续跃进的方针。其中特别指出了加强合成橡胶工业的建设和发展合成橡胶生产的方向，满足了全国人民热烈的愿望，我作为一个橡胶工业的技术人员来说，真是感到说不出的欢欣鼓舞，这是向全世界宣布我们国家亦有了合成橡胶工业了，我们橡胶工业解放以来随着国民经济的发展，工农业生产和交通运输事业的不断增长，科学技术的不断提高，对产品的需要越来越多，特别是大跃进以来由于重工业、航空工业、汽车工业、尖端技术等的高度发展，橡胶制品不但在数量上不能满足需要，而在某些性能上亦不能满足越来越高的要求，如耐油、耐高温、耐老化、耐透气性等性能，已非天然橡胶所能满足，而合成橡胶就能具有上列各种性能，我国发展合成橡胶工业正是说明我国工业水平的提高，同时标志着我国橡胶工业发展的一个新阶段，为我国橡胶工业史上的一件大喜事，使我国从橡胶的加工工业进一步向橡胶生产工业发展，是一个具有伟大意义的新阶段，使我体会到：
    解放以来橡胶工业在党的正确领导下有了飞跃的发展，产品已达到二万多种，基本上满足了国民经济的需要，但是由于解放前反动派不重视天然橡胶的培植，基本上依靠进口，解放后虽已大规模的培植，由于受自然条件的限制，天然橡胶的产量还不能满足愈来愈多的需要，而且大部分仍需进口。因此橡胶工业的生产潜力受到束缚，不能充分发挥，所以跃进速度亦受了一定程度的限制，发展合成橡胶工业可以不受自然条件的限制，同时合成橡胶的生产可以补充天然橡胶性能上的不足，保证了橡胶工业的原料供应，从而对满足工农业、交通运输事业、人民生活日用品的不断增长的需要的持续跃进，为橡胶工业打下了基础。
    由于我国天然橡胶生产的增长速度跟不上橡胶工业发展的速度，不能满足生产需要，每年仍需进口大量天然橡胶，消费大量外汇，所以合成橡胶工业的建设，既贯彻了自力更生的方针，又节约外汇，满足国民经济需要，具有重要的经济意义。更重要的是橡胶为战略物资，为国防工业的重要材料之一。解放以来，美帝国主义一直采取种种阴谋，封锁、垄断、阻止各橡胶生产国家对我国的输出，企图破坏我国社会主义建设，最近又策动印度尼西亚反华排华并企图垄断橡胶的贸易，歧视抬价。因此我国发展合成橡胶工业是反帝斗争的一部分，亦是对美帝国主义封锁破坏的沉重打击，所以亦具有特别重大的政治意义，同时合成橡胶工业的发展，亦标志着我国工业技术水平的赶上国际水平，对提前赶上和超过英国的工业生产水平具有重要的意义。
    根据我国的气候地理条件，在南方各省完全能够大量培植橡胶树，以满足对天然橡胶资源的需要，但橡胶树一般需生长六七年才能采取橡胶，虽然解放后经不断的改良缩短了采胶年期，但仍需四五年之久。因此虽然大面积培植，还是跟不上当前跃进的形势，而合成橡胶的生产，从基建到投入生产根据我国工业发展的速度可以不需一年，并不受气候土壤等自然条件的限制。因此一方面利用我国具有的自然条件，如李富春副总理在报告中所指出，加强天然橡胶的培植，来逐步满足对天然橡胶的需要，一方面同时积极发展合成橡胶的建设与生产，既满足当前国民经济的迫切需要，又配合工农业高度发展的特种需要，是完全符合总路线的一整套两条腿走路同时并举方针的精神的。
    制造合成橡胶的原料，主要有薯类（农产品），锯屑、煤、石油、天然煤气等，我国都有充分的丰富的资源，特别是两年来连续大跃进，这些物资又有了大量的增产，为合成橡胶原料创造了有利的条件，由于合成橡胶工业的发展，这些资源能够得到充分的应用，特别是煤、石油、天然煤气等的综合利用扩大了范围。一方面贯彻了以农业为基础以工业为主导的精神，一方面又贯彻了加强天然资源综合利用的方针。
    自1958年大跃进以来，全国各地橡胶工业和研究单位热烈地开展了合成橡胶的试验研究工作，大部地区并建立了实验工场。一年多来在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，克服了一系列的困难，都取得了巨大的成就，初步丰富了和掌握了合成橡胶的生产技术，并培养了大量技术力量和生产骨干。在研究过程中，我们不断得到了世界上第一个生产合成橡胶的苏联的无私帮助。目前形势这样良好，条件又是这样具备，加之我们有毛泽东思想的指导，有党的正确领导，有总路线大跃进人民公社三大高速度建设社会主义的法宝，我们有充分信心，一定能完成党的号召，完全能够克服一切困难，高速度地发展合成橡胶工业。
    我们橡胶工业现在正进入一个历史的新阶段。我作为一个橡胶技术人员，十年来在党的不断培养教育下，思想觉悟虽然有了不少提高，但还远远跟不上形势的发展，与资产阶级的立场与世界观还没有完全决裂，彻底改造。因此必须认真的学习毛主席著作，学习和掌握毛泽东思想，学习工人阶级的共产主义风格，继续加强对资产阶级立场和世界观的彻底改造，树立为社会主义服务的思想意志，提高为社会主义服务的工作能力，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，积极投入技术革新技术革命运动中，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划和为发展合成橡胶工业，努力奋斗并贡献一切力量。
    以上是否有当请各位委员指正。
