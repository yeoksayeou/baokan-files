The magnificent People's Great Hall, bathed in the golden sunlight of spring, appeared particularly solemn.

Today—April 4th, the second session of the Second National People's Congress entered its first day of speeches. Representatives from all over the country, on the podium of six hundred million people, cheered the great achievements of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, and looked forward with confidence to the infinitely bright and beautiful prospects of 1960 and the entire 1960s. As Ji Mingxuan, the director of the Jilunzhai People's Commune in the Huaibei Plain, said: "Chairman Mao found us the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, paving the bright road to communism for us. It's truly ‘three stars shine brightly, ten thousand years of happiness to come.’" He expressed the thoughts of over a thousand representatives and six hundred million people across the country.

	Revolutionary Tide Advances a Thousand Miles a Day

"The current situation is getting better and better, with factories united as one, galloping forward, everywhere full of vibrant colors, and everything is being renewed." This is how Huang Rongchang and four other representatives from Chongqing described the overall leaping forward situation on the industrial front in Chongqing in their joint speech.

Chongqing's industry, like industry in other parts of the country, continued to leap forward this year on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. The city exceeded its first quarter's total industrial output value plan seven days ahead of schedule, winning a good start in 1960. Since November last year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has spread rapidly throughout the city like wildfire. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city's factories and mining enterprises has increased from 32.2% at the end of November last year to 57.1%, an average increase of 2.2% every ten days. "Old factories get new looks, new factories are new every day," and "one factory is equivalent to several factories, one person is equivalent to several people" have become a common phenomenon in Chongqing. The Yangtze River Fiber Factory is a small factory in Chongqing, with 95% of its operations being manual. The factory did not have a single technical worker who understood machinery, not even a pair of pliers. However, difficulties could not stop their ambition. The workers relied on two borrowed pliers and an old hand drill, using bamboo and wood instead of steel, and hemp rope as belts. They traveled to textile factories all over the city to seek teachers and friends, learning from their experiences. Finally, they achieved full mechanization of the factory in just over a month.

Huang Rongchang, who started learning wood carving at the age of twelve, is a mechanical engineer at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and a well-known technical innovation expert in Chongqing. Over the past ten years, he has learned eleven techniques such as turning, fitting, planing, and milling, and has designed and manufactured seventy-one machines. Today, in his joint speech, he said proudly: "In the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings to further break down superstitions and liberate our minds. We will learn what is advanced in the world; what does not exist in the world, we will create."

Today, Zhang Debao, a representative from Ma'anshan, reported to the conference on the production and construction achievements of this iron and steel enterprise, which achieved "investment of one equals two, and work efficiency doubles." In 1959, the pig iron output of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company increased 1.5 times compared to 1958; steel output increased 28 times compared to 1958. The Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace of the First Iron Smelting Plant achieved a monthly average utilization coefficient of more than 4, becoming a red flag in small blast furnace production nationwide; the workers engaged in basic construction built a 90-meter-high chimney for the coking and chemical plant in just six days, twenty hours, and fifteen minutes. The workers praised this rapid construction in a poem: "In the morning, see a pile of bricks on the ground, in the evening, see a red pagoda in the white clouds, it's not that the pedestrians are seeing things, but the heroes' enthusiasm breaks through the sky."

	Rural Communes Shake the Mountains and Rivers

"The commune is a golden bridge to happiness!" "The commune is our rural avenue to communism!" Representatives from all over the country today used countless inspiring facts to warmly praise the great achievements of the People's Commune.

Zhao Wenfu, the vice governor of Henan Province, told us in his speech that in 1959, the people of Henan used the power of the commune to overcome an unprecedented drought that lasted for 250 consecutive days. People used these verses to praise their labor achievements: "If the sky does not rain, people will rain, and the harvest is determined by people, not by the sky." This province also experienced a drought in 1942. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government, the Japanese invaders, and the local tyrants and bullies made a fortune from the disaster, imposing heavy taxes and extortion. The natural disaster combined with man-made disasters caused a tragic scene of barren land, starving people everywhere, families broken and scattered, and wives and children separated. In that year alone, more than 13 million people in Henan Province left their homes to escape famine, and more than 3 million people were starved to death. Recalling it, one cannot help but shudder! But what is the situation today? Starting in July 1959, more than 90 counties in Henan experienced drought, more than 40 counties more than in 1942; the drought lasted 200 days longer than in 1942; the drought-affected area was nearly 100 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the province's cultivated land area, more than 30 million mu more than in 1942. Although the drought was so severe, Henan Province not only did not reduce production, but also won a bumper harvest in the autumn of 1959. In 1959, the total agricultural output value of Henan Province increased by 21.9% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the total grain output increased by 13.75%. The entire countryside presented a thriving and vigorous leap forward scene.

Zhao Wenfu enthusiastically talked about the heroic spirit of the people of Henan conquering nature under the leadership of the Party. He said that as soon as the drought occurred, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the battle slogan of "mobilizing the whole Party, vowing by all the people, resisting the drought to the end, and ensuring a bumper harvest without rain," and quickly launched a massive and magnificent anti-drought and bumper harvest movement throughout the province. Industry supported agriculture, the army supported the localities, and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers twisted into a rope. More than 1 million cadres and more than 20 million people in the province participated in the anti-drought struggle. They braved the scorching heat of 40 degrees Celsius, fought day and night, and irrigated 270 million mu of land, using more than 18 billion cubic meters of water, which was equivalent to several artificial rainfalls. In the anti-drought wheat planting, the people of Lin County expanded the "Hero Canal" project in the majestic Taihang Mountains with the spirit of shaking the mountains and rivers. They split 359 ridges, filled 569 ditches, and dug mountain caves and built sky bridges, extending the "Hero Canal" to 547 li, expanding the irrigation area and completing the wheat planting task in a timely manner. The Yaozhai Brigade of the Zhaibei People's Commune in Guangshan County concentrated 45 waterwheels and adopted the method of "multiple immortals passing on the Tao" and step-by-step water lifting, transporting the water of Moon Lake, 15 li away, through 21 turns to the hill 15 zhang high, irrigating more than 230 mu of land. The commune members happily sang: "Water has always flowed downhill, who has ever seen water going uphill? The commune can turn the world upside down, and let the lake water turn over the mountain!"

The People's Commune is not only a magic weapon for 500 million peasants to overcome natural disasters, but it is also changing the face of the motherland and the mountains and rivers of the motherland according to people's wishes. Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, famous agricultural labor models, boldly proposed at the meeting: "The good system of the People's Commune is like a key that opens the treasure house of mountain production and encourages everyone's enthusiasm. We must rearrange the rivers and mountains and let nature obey our commands." Their leap forward slogan in Pingding County is: Turn the Taihang Mountains into the Jiangnan region, and turn the high mountain and thin land into a granary. In 1959, the county achieved the grain target of the Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. The Taihang Mountains is a place with few rivers and many mountains, thick stones and thin soil. Pingding has two dry river beaches, which are a full 100 li long. The uneven mountainous land along the river is terraced fields created by humans, which is an old low-yield "pot bottom." During the mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives, people relied on the collective strength to fight against the poor mountains and bad waters, realizing the land ridge and initially controlling soil erosion, so that grain production increased. However, the land has not been greatly "turned over," and there is no guarantee that the output will continue to increase step by step. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the Pingding County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the ten communes in the county to organize the "Ten Thousand People Hundred Li Beach Battle," comprehensively managing from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, forming slopes and ditches. They planted trees, afforested, repaired valley dams, and repaired reservoirs, fighting day and night, and finally achieved "stones lining up, land banks raising their heads, conserving soil and storing water, and land turning over."

From the Taihang Mountains to the banks of the Huai River, miracles created by the People's Commune can be seen everywhere. Ji Mingxuan of the Jilunzhai People's Commune in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, summarized the scenery of his hometown with a folk song: "The Huaibei Plain has changed its appearance, the earth is woven into a silver river network, the past was a sandy land, now the rice flowers are fragrant everywhere." Before liberation, in that place where "nine out of ten years were barren," it was either waterlogged or droughty, and people's lives were as bitter as Coptis chinensis. In the winter of 1957, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to "network the rivers, rice paddy, and turn Huaibei into Jiangnan." Turning water hazards into water conservancy and turning poverty into prosperity was a long-term and urgent wish of the people of Huaibei, and they of course responded enthusiastically to the Party's call. However, at that time, due to the small scale and limited strength of the advanced cooperatives, it was difficult to realize this great ideal in the short term. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the Jilunzhai People's Commune extracted more than 17,000 people in the winter of 1958 and the spring and summer of 1959 to engage in large-scale river networking, opening up 12 large river channels 40 meters wide. In one year, the river networking was initially realized. Last year, although there was an unprecedented drought, agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, and industrial sectors continued to leap forward. Now, the commune has a network of rivers and streams, rice fields in patches, green water overflowing, geese and ducks in groups, and fruit trees in forests. The average yield per mu of grain in the commune is 718 jin, achieving and exceeding the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule.

In the remote border areas of the motherland, the song of "The People's Commune is Good" has resounded throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Saifuddin, the chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, pointed out in his speech that more than a year of practice has proved that the People's Commune is a great organizational force for us to realize a great leap forward in socialist construction in rural and pastoral areas in an organized manner. Only through communization can we more fully and quickly realize the "Eight-Character Constitution" in agriculture. Only the People's Commune can fundamentally change the backward economic and cultural face of pastoral areas. With the communization of the people, the vast number of herdsmen have settled down, basically ending the nomadic life of grazing by water and grass for generations. A beautiful scene of prosperity for both people and livestock has generally appeared in pastoral areas. The combination of agriculture and animal husbandry has been generally implemented. Areas that did not grow grain or rarely grew grain in the past can now not only generally achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed, but some communes also have surplus grain. Many new towns have been established on the grasslands, and 90% of school-age children in pastoral areas have already enrolled in school.

Lenin said in his article "A Great Beginning": "Only where the petty household economy is generally transformed into a socialist economy on a mass scale is it possible to have real liberation of women, is it possible to have real communism." From the speeches of the representatives today, we have a deeper understanding that the realization of the communization of the people has led women to the road of complete liberation. Li Guiying and Zhang Huiying, representatives from Yunnan, brought to the conference the good news of the great emancipation of women of all ethnic groups in the border areas. As they said, the development of collective welfare undertakings in the People's Commune has liberated the vast number of women from scattered, individual, and tedious household chores, allowing them to participate in social labor and political and cultural learning. Now, a large number of women have become the main force on the production front. The women vividly described the situation before and after the communization, saying: "In the past, women were in charge of small families, and opening the door revealed seven messy things. They were spinning around in front of the pot and behind the mill, with a little doll on their backs; they wanted to go to the fields to produce, but their hearts were at home. Now, household chores are socialized, and thousands of families are laughing. Go to the public canteen to eat, send the children to the nurseries, and concentrate on production without any worries, not afraid of the sun setting when leaving work, and the whole family is happy when returning from labor, learning culture without rushing. Learning and labor are all good, and being a model is praised by everyone."

	Urban Communes are Rising Sun

The vast number of peasants cheered the victory of the People's Commune, and the urban people also urgently demanded to be further organized to participate in production and live a collective life. Today, a movement to run People's Communes on a large scale, run street industries on a large scale, run suburban agriculture on a large scale, run public welfare undertakings on a large scale, and run public canteens on a large scale is sweeping across all cities and towns in the country. Millions of urban housewives have also been freed from household labor and, like men, have devoted themselves to social labor without any worries. The social appearance of cities has undergone earth-shaking changes. Representative Liao Suhua meticulously introduced how Chongqing organized the economic life of the people. Her speech was particularly welcomed by the conference. The city grasped production with one hand and life with the other, organizing the production, life, and education of the masses in a unified manner with the development of production as the center. Since 1958, 330,000 people have been employed in the city, which is equivalent to twice the total number of people employed in the past eight years. "Everyone is busy with production, and every household has no idlers," everywhere is a vibrant scene. The vast majority of street residents with labor capacity have participated in social production and social services. The city has run more than 6,000 collective canteens, with the number of people eating together accounting for about 82% of the total number of residents; it has also run more than 20,000 nurseries (stations) and more than 3,000 various mass service organizations, so that everyone can do their part. Through organizing the economic life of the people, the new relationship of unity, love, mutual assistance, and cooperation between people has been further developed. New moral customs have been established, and examples of respecting the old and loving the young, helping the sick and saving the injured, picking up lost items, family unity, and neighborhood harmony are everywhere. Peng Chong, the first secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an inspiring and wonderful speech on the issue of running street industries on a large scale. He used vivid facts to illustrate that running street industries on a large scale is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life. Nanjing was a typical consumer city before liberation. In 1949, the total industrial output value of the city was only 50 million yuan, but what about now? The output value and processing fees of street industries alone in January and February this year were 213 million yuan. More than 90% of the street residents in the city have participated in various production and social service labor, the vast majority of whom are housewives. They have been freed from household labor and have become the main force in street industries and service undertakings. Street industries, like stars in the sky, have become an emerging social productive force. Nanjing's street industries include more than a dozen industries such as chemical industry, telecommunications instruments, hardware machinery, metal smelting, building materials, glass instruments, textiles, and sewing. There are more than 1,000 kinds of products, and the quality of some products has reached the domestic advanced level. In 1959, more than 60% of the small hardware and small commodities produced in Nanjing were produced by street industries. The development of street production and service undertakings has greatly improved the lives of the vast number of residents. People who originally needed relief can support themselves through labor. Many streets have also drawn part of the funds from production accumulation to rebuild their homes, and many shantytowns have been transformed into new neighborhoods with factories, schools, hospitals, public canteens, and nurseries in a short period of time.

Today, the shining speeches of representatives from all over the country vividly and figuratively depict the style of our great motherland's Great Leap Forward era. Every representative in the venue can deeply feel the pulse of the Great Leap Forward era. The magnificent achievements of socialist construction praised by the representatives eloquently show that we are doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before. These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the continuous leap forward of the entire 1960s.

    三星当头照　万年幸福来
    ——第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议旁听记　本报记者
    巍峨壮丽的人民大会堂，沐浴在春天金色的阳光里，显得分外庄严。
    今天——4月4日，第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，进入大会发言的第一天。来自各地的代表，在六亿人民的讲坛上，欢呼1958和1959两年连续大跃进的伟大成就，满怀信心地展望1960年和整个六十年代无限光明美好的前景。正如淮北平原纪伦寨人民公社主任纪明选所说的：“毛主席给我们找到了总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝，为我们铺出了通向共产主义的光明大道，真是‘三星当头照，万年幸福来。’”他道出了一千多位代表和全国六亿人民心里的话。
    革新浪潮一日千里
    “目前的形势越来越好，厂厂万众一心，万马奔腾，处处万紫千红，万象更新。”这是重庆市黄荣昌等五位代表在联合发言中，对重庆市工业战线全面跃进的形势所作的描述。
    重庆市的工业，像全国其他地区的工业一样，在1959年大跃进的基础上，今年继续跃进。全市提前七天超额完成了第一季度的工业总产值计划，夺得了1960年开门红的胜利。自从去年11月份以来，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，星火燎原般地在全市迅速展开。全市厂矿企业机械化、半机械化程度，已由去年11月底的32.2％提高到57.1％，平均每十天就提高2.2％。“老厂改新装，新厂日日新”、“一厂顶数厂，一人顶数人”，已经成为重庆市的一种普遍现象。长江纤维厂是重庆市的一个小厂，95％是手工操作。全厂没有一个懂机械的技术工人，连一把老虎钳子也没有，但困难挡不住他们的雄心大志，工人们靠借来的两把老虎钳和一台旧手摇钻，用楠竹、木材代钢材，麻绳当皮带，走遍全市的纺织厂寻师访友，取经学艺，终于在一个多月内实现了全厂机械化。
    从十二岁就开始学雕花木工的黄荣昌，是重庆钢铁公司的机械工程师，也是重庆市有名的技术革新能手。十年来，他学会了车、钳、刨、铣等十一种技术，设计和制造了七十一部机器。今天，他在联合发言中豪迈地说：“在伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们遵循着毛主席的教导，进一步破除迷信，解放思想。世界上先进的，我们要学；世界上没有的，我们就创造。”
    今天，来自马鞍山的代表张德宝，向大会汇报了这个钢铁企业“投资一顶二，工效成倍翻”的生产建设成就。1959年，马鞍山钢铁公司的生铁产量，比1958年增长了一点五倍；钢产量比1958年增长了二十八倍。第一炼铁厂的红旗二号小高炉，月平均利用系数达到四以上，成为全国小高炉生产的一面红旗；从事基本建设的工人们，只用六天零二十小时十五分钟，就筑起了炼焦化工厂一座九十米高的烟囱。工人们作诗赞扬这种快速施工道：“早看平地一堆砖，暮见红塔白云间，非是行人弄花眼，英雄干劲冲破天。”
    农村公社威震山河
    “公社是通向幸福的金桥梁！”“公社是我们农村通向共产主义的康庄大道！”来自各地的代表，今天用无数激荡人心的事实，热烈歌颂了人民公社的丰功伟绩。
    河南省副省长赵文甫代表在发言中告诉我们：1959年，河南人民曾经凭借公社的威力，战胜了连续二百五十天的空前旱灾。人们用这样的诗句来歌颂自己的劳动成果：“天不下雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天。”这个省1942年也曾发生过旱灾，当时国民党反动政府、日寇和地主恶霸大发灾难财，横征暴敛，敲榨勒索。天灾加人祸，造成了赤地千里、饿殍载道、家破人亡、妻离子散的悲惨景象。就在那一年，河南省一千三百多万人离乡背井、逃荒要饭，有三百多万人被活活的饿死。回忆起来，真是不寒而栗！可是，今天的情况呢？从1959年7月开始，河南发生干旱的县达九十多个，比1942年多四十多个县；干旱时间比1942年长二百天；受旱面积近一亿亩，占全省耕地面积80％以上，比1942年多三千多万亩。虽然旱情这样严重，河南省不但没有减产，反而夺得了1959年秋季大丰收。1959年河南省农业总产值比大跃进的1958年还增长了21.9％，粮食总产量增长了13.75％。整个农村呈现出一派欣欣向荣、生气勃勃的跃进景象。
    赵文甫热情洋溢地谈到河南人民在党的领导下，征服自然的英雄气概。他说，当旱象刚一发生，中共河南省委就提出了“全党动员，万民发誓，有旱抗到底，无雨保丰收”的战斗口号，在全省范围内很快掀起了一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的抗旱保丰收运动。工业支援农业，军队支援地方，工农商学兵拧成一股绳，全省投入抗旱斗争的干部有一百多万人，群众有二千多万人。他们冒着四十度的酷暑炎热，昼夜鏖战，抗旱浇地面积达到二亿七千万亩次，用水量达到一百八十多亿公方，等于人工降了几次大雨。林县人民在抗旱种麦中，以摇撼山河的气概，在巍峨的太行山脉扩建了“英雄渠”工程。他们劈开了三百五十九个岭，填平了五百六十九道沟，凿山洞，架天桥，把“英雄渠”延长到五百四十七华里，扩大了灌溉面积，适时完成了种麦任务。光山县砦河人民公社的姚砦大队，集中四十五部水车，采取“多仙传道”、梯级提水的办法，把十五里以外的月儿湖水，倒了二十一转，送到十五丈高的岗岭上，浇地二百三十多亩。社员们欢乐地唱道：“从来水向山下流，那见水往山上走？公社能把乾坤扭，竟让湖水翻山头！”
    人民公社不仅是五亿农民战胜天灾的法宝，它正在使祖国的大地、祖国的山岳河川按照人们的意愿改变面貌。著名农业劳模李顺达，申纪兰在会上豪迈地提出：“人民公社的好制度，就像一把钥匙，打开了山区生产的宝库，鼓舞了每个人的干劲。我们要重新安排河山，让大自然听从我们的使唤。”他们平顺县的跃进口号是：太行变江南，高山薄地变粮仓。1959年，全县提前八年实现了农业发展纲要的粮食指标。太行山区是个山大川少、石厚土薄的地方。平顺有两条干河滩，足足有一百里长。沿河两旁高低不平的山地，是人工造成的梯田，是个老低产“锅底”。在互助组、农业社的时候，人们依靠集体的力量和穷山恶水斗争，实现了地埂化，初步控制水土流失，使粮食增产。可是，土地还没有大“翻身”，产量再步步提高还没有保证。人民公社化以后，中共平顺县委领导全县十个公社组织了“万人百里滩大战”，从山头到山脚，成坡成沟的全面治理。他们植树、造林，修谷坊，修水库，白天黑夜的奋战，终于做到了“石头排队、地岸抬头、保土蓄水、土地翻身”。
    从太行山到淮河两岸，到处都可以看到人民公社创造的奇迹。安徽省涡阳县纪伦寨人民公社的纪明选，用一首歌谣概括了自己家乡的风光：“淮北平原变了样，大地织成银河网，过去一片砂矼地，如今处处稻花香。”解放以前，在那“十年倒有九年荒”的地方，不是涝就是旱，人民生活苦如黄连。1957年冬天，中共安徽省委提出了“河网化、水稻化、变淮北为江南”的号召。化水害为水利、变贫困为富裕，这是淮北人民长期以来的迫切愿望，他们当然热烈响应党的号召。但是，当时由于高级社规模小、力量小，短期内很难实现这个伟大的理想。成立人民公社以后，纪伦寨人民公社在1958年冬和1959年春夏季，抽出了一万七千多人，大搞河网化，新开了十二条四十米宽的大河道，一年功夫就初步实现了河网化。去年那里虽然遇到百年未有的特大干旱，却仍然取得了农、林、牧、副、渔、工六业继续大跃进。现在，全社河网纵横，稻田成片，绿水盈盈，鹅鸭成群，果树成林。公社粮食平均亩产七百一十八斤，提前八年实现并超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。
    在祖国遥远的边疆，“人民公社好”的歌声，已响彻天山南北。新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎代表在发言中指出，一年多的实践证明：人民公社是我们在农村牧区有组织地实现社会主义建设大跃进的伟大组织力量。只有公社化，才能在农业上更完满地、迅速地实现“八字宪法”。只有人民公社，才能从根本上改变牧区经济、文化的落后面貌。随着人民公社化，广大牧民实行了定居，基本上结束了祖祖辈辈逐水草而居的游牧生活，牧区普遍出现了人畜两旺的美好景象。普遍实行农牧结合，过去不种粮食或很少种粮食的地区，现在不只是一般可以做到粮食、饲料自给，有的社还有余粮。草原上已建立起许多新的城镇，牧区90％的学龄儿童已经入学。
    列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中说过：“只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”从今天代表们的发言中，我们更深刻地认识到：人民公社化的实现，使妇女走上了彻底解放的道路。云南代表李桂英、张惠英给大会带来了边疆各族妇女大翻身的喜讯。正如她们所说，人民公社集体福利事业的发展，使广大妇女从分散的、个体的繁琐家务中解放出来，参加社会劳动和政治、文化学习。现在，大批妇女已经成为生产战线上的主力军。妇女们生动地描绘公社化前后的情况说：“过去妇女当小家，开门七事乱如麻。锅前磨后团团转，背上背个小娃娃；有心下田去生产，人在田里心在家。如今家务社会化，千家万户笑哈哈。公共食堂去吃饭，托儿所里送娃娃，一心生产无牵挂，收工不怕日西斜，劳动回来全家乐，不慌不忙学文化。学习劳动样样好，当了模范人人夸。”
    城市公社旭日东升
    广大农民欢呼人民公社的胜利，城市人民也迫切要求进一步组织起来参加生产，过集体生活。如今，一个大办人民公社、大办街道工业、大办郊区农业、大办公共福利事业、大办公共食堂的运动，正席卷全国各个大小城市。千百万城市家庭妇女也摆脱了家务劳动，和男子一样无牵挂地投入社会劳动，城市的社会面貌发生了翻天覆地的大变化。廖苏华代表细致地介绍了重庆市是怎样组织人民经济生活的，她的发言特别受到大会的欢迎。这个城市一手抓生产，一手抓生活，以发展生产为中心把群众的生产、生活、教育统一组织起来。1958年以来，全市有三十三万人就了业，相当于过去八年就业人数总和的两倍。“人人忙生产，户户无闲人”，到处是一片生气勃勃的气象，有劳动能力的街道居民绝大部分都参加了社会生产和社会服务。全市共办了集体食堂六千多个，搭伙人数占居民总数的82％左右；还办了两万多个托儿所（站）和三千多处各种群众性的服务组织，做到了大家的事大家办。通过组织人民经济生活，进一步发展了人与人之间团结友爱、互助合作的新关系。新的道德风尚树立了，尊老爱幼、扶病救伤、拾金不昧、家庭团结、邻里和睦的事例到处都有。中共南京市委第一书记彭冲代表对大办街道工业的问题，作了振奋人心的精彩发言。他用生动的事实，说明了大办街道工业，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。南京，在解放前是一个典型的消费城市。1949年全市全年工业总产值只有五千万元，而现在呢？仅仅街道工业今年1、2月份的产值和加工费，就有二亿一千三百万元。全市街道居民已有90％以上参加了各种生产和社会服务劳动，其中绝大部分是家庭妇女。她们从家务劳动中解放出来，成为街道工业、服务事业中的主力军。像满天星斗一样的街道工业，已经成为新兴的社会生产力量。南京街道工业有化工、电讯仪表、五金机械、金属冶炼、建筑材料、玻璃仪器、纺织、缝纫等十多个行业，产品有一千多种，有些产品的质量已经达到国内先进水平。1959年南京市生产的小五金、小百货，有60％以上是街道工业生产的。街道生产、服务事业的发展，大大改善了广大居民群众的生活，原来需要救济的人都可以用劳动养活自己。许多街道还从生产积累中抽出部分资金改建家园，不少棚户区在短短时间内焕然一新，变成了有工厂、学校、医院、公共食堂、托儿所的环境幽美的新街坊。
    今天，各地代表光彩闪烁的发言，生动而形象地绘出了我们伟大祖国大跃进时代的风貌。置身在会场上的每一个代表，都能深深感到大跃进时代脉搏的跳动。代表们所歌颂的社会主义建设事业的宏伟成就，雄辩地说明：我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。这些成就，为整个六十年代的连续跃进，奠定了稳固的基础。
