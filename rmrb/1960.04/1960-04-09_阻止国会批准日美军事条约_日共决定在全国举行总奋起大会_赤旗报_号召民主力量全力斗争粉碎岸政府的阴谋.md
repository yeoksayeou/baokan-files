Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party is preparing to hold a series of general uprising assemblies in various locations starting in mid-April to resolutely oppose the Diet's ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee will hold a large-scale general uprising assembly on the 17th at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall with the participation of 12,000 party members and their families to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, will deliver a speech at the meeting. After the meeting, representatives will be dispatched to protest to the Kishi government and the U.S. Embassy in Japan, and all participants will hold demonstrations in the streets.

Responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, the Japanese Communist Party's prefectural committees are also preparing to hold general uprising assemblies. The Osaka Prefectural Committee and the Hyogo Prefectural Committee will hold general uprising assemblies in Osaka and Kobe on the 21st and 18th, respectively. Hiroshima, Sapporo, Sendai, Niigata, Mito, Chiba, Yokohama, Nagano, Nagoya, and Yonezawa, Yamagata, Tsuruoka, and Sakata in Yamagata Prefecture will successively hold large-scale general uprising assemblies and launch various actions from mid-April to early May to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: "Akahata" published an editorial today calling on democratic forces across the country to concentrate all their efforts on launching a struggle to smash the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which attempts to rely on the Liberal Democratic Party to deliberate and forcibly pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government claimed that it wanted to end the Diet's deliberation on the new "Security Treaty" before April 22 because it feared that the longer the deliberation period, the higher the democratic forces' struggle against the Diet's ratification of the treaty would become. Therefore, it attempted to forcibly deliberate and pass the new "Security Treaty" solely by the Liberal Democratic Party in the Diet.

The editorial emphasized that with the conclusion of the aggressive Japan-U.S. "Military Alliance Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese traitorous monopoly capital's aggressive ambitions have been clearly exposed. They trampled on the Japanese people's wishes for concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty and restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations. Therefore, the people's dissatisfaction with it is rising day by day.

"Akahata" pointed out that this situation is due to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and traitorous monopoly capital succumbing to U.S. imperialism and adhering to a policy of reviving militarism and imperialism.

"Akahata" said that at this critical moment, democratic forces and people across the country should become more united and unite, and based on the broad masses of people's demands for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, extensively launch actions to give the Kishi Nobusuke government and reactionary forces a heavy blow.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch: Vice-President of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Banboku Ono, said in Osaka on the 5th that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to prepare for the visit of U.S. President Eisenhower (in June) to Japan, is determined to have the new "Security Treaty" passed by the House of Representatives no later than April 24. Ono said, "(Kishi Nobusuke) The Prime Minister currently only has the passage of the Security Treaty in mind." He said that if the Socialist Party does not agree to participate in the deliberation of this treaty, the Liberal Democratic Party will "deliberate alone without hesitation."

Ono's remarks revealed the Kishi Nobusuke group's desire to disregard the opposition of the Japanese people and opposition parties and to force the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors to pass the new "Security Treaty" before the end of this Diet session at the end of May in order to please the United States.

    阻止国会批准日美军事条约
    日共决定在全国举行总奋起大会
    “赤旗报”号召民主力量全力斗争粉碎岸政府的阴谋
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党准备从4月中旬起在各地相继举行总奋起大会，坚决反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”。
    日本共产党中央委员会和东京都委员会将在17日在日比谷露天音乐堂举行有一万二千名党员和党员家属参加的声势浩大的阻止批准新“安全条约”总奋起大会。日本共产党总书记宫本显治将在会上发表演说。大会结束后将派遣代表向岸政府和美国驻日大使馆提出抗议，全体与会者还要到街上去举行示威游行。
    日本共产党县级委员会响应党中央的号召，也正在准备举行总奋起大会：大阪府委员会和兵库县委员会将在21日和18日分别在大阪和神户举行总奋起大会；广岛，札幌，仙台，新潟，水户，千叶，横滨，长野，名古屋，以及山形县的米泽、山形、鹤冈和酒田，将先后在从4月中旬到5月初期间举行声势浩大的总奋起大会，并且展开各种行动，阻止国会批准新“安全条约”。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召全国民主力量集中全力展开斗争，粉碎岸信介政府企图依靠自由民主党单独审议、强行在国会通过新日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    社论指出，岸信介政府扬言要在4月22日以前结束国会关于新“安全条约”的审议，是因为它怕审议期间拉得太长，民主力量反对国会批准这个条约的斗争将更加高涨。因此它企图强行在国会内由自由民主党单独审议和通过新“安全条约”。
    社论强调指出，随着侵略性的日美“军事同盟条约”的缔结，岸信介政府和日本卖国垄断资本的侵略野心清楚地被揭露了出来。他们蹂躏了日本人民关于缔结日苏和约和恢复日中邦交的愿望。因此，人民对它的不满正在日益高涨。
    “赤旗报”指出，这种形势是由于岸信介内阁和卖国垄断资本屈从美帝国主义、坚持复活军国主义和帝国主义的政策所产生的。
    “赤旗报”说，在目前重大关头，全国民主力量和人民应该更加统一和团结起来，以广大人民争取和平、独立、民主和中立的要求为基础，广泛地展开行动，给予岸信介政府和反动势力以沉重的打击。
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦5日在大阪说：岸信介政府为了做好迎接美国总统艾森豪威尔（6月）访问日本的准备工作，决心至迟要在4月24日以前使新“安全条约”在众议院获得通过。大野说，“（岸信介）首相的心中目前只有使安全条约获得通过”。他说，如果社会党不同意参加这项条约的审议工作，自由民主党就是“单独审议也在所不辞”。
    大野的这番话说破了岸信介集团不顾日本人民和在野党派的反对，一定要在这次国会在5月底闭幕以前强迫众、参两院通过新“安全条约”以取悦于美国的心情。
