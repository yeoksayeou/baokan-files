Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

    We completely agree with and support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and we are willing to work hard for their realization.

    Over the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Especially under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people's communes and the extraordinary Great Leap Forward of 1958 emerged. Based on this, another comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward was achieved in 1959, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy three years ahead of schedule, creating miracles that shocked the world. Sichuan, like all parts of the country, has achieved brilliant successes on all fronts under the leadership of the Party. Since the beginning of this year, the people of the whole province have responded to the Party's call and are advancing heroically with even greater enthusiasm, "one heart, one mind, one spirit." Good news from all sides keeps coming with the spring breeze. We firmly believe that the inspiring national economic plan for 1960 will be successfully completed. In the face of such a great situation of high-speed, sustained Great Leap Forward, in the next ten or eight years, our motherland will undergo fundamental changes, and the material and cultural lives of more than 600 million people will be further improved. Faced with such a good situation and looking forward to the infinitely beautiful future of our motherland, our horizons have broadened, our minds have opened, and our spirits have become more joyful and invigorated, which makes us further realize the wisdom, greatness, and correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Sichuan Province Industrialists and Businessmen Have Made Great Progress Under the Leadership of the Party, But This Progress Is Still Very Insufficient

    Along with the changes in the country, our industrial and commercial circles have also undergone profound changes. Industrialists and businessmen have experienced the complete industry-wide public-private partnership, changing their social and economic status; after the education of the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, they realized that "the Communist Party cannot be opposed, the capitalist road cannot be taken, and rightists cannot be," and their political thought has also improved. On this basis, following the instructions of the Party, they have turned to production, work, and labor practice. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and driven by the continuous leaps forward, and with the drive and help of the workers and masses, most of the industrialists and businessmen in our province have successively joined the Great Leap Forward, participating in work that serves socialism. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in response to the Party's call, in the campaigns of fighting hard in August and September to present gifts for National Day, and making a decisive battle in the fourth quarter to strive for "all-round red" and this year's "good start," and workers together, they have generally been able to complete the tasks they have undertaken. Regarding technical innovation and technical revolution, many people, in combination with workers, have focused on "three highs and one low" (high quality, high yield, high efficiency, low cost), safe production, and the requirements of supporting agriculture, and have done a lot of work in trial-producing new products, finding substitutes, improving production equipment, improving production efficiency, improving product quality, and saving raw materials. Some of them have made significant achievements. Compared with the past, the number of people who are active in their work has increased, the number of innovation proposals has increased, and the value of increased production and savings has also increased. For example, from January to November 1959, industrial and commercial circles in Zigong City put forward more than 12,000 rationalization proposals, saving a value of about 1.2 million yuan; the number of people rated as advanced producers and advanced workers in various places has also gradually increased. During this period, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen participated in labor training. Many went down to workshops and up to counters, implemented follow-up labor in the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and changed their past work styles. Many responded to the Party's call to support industrial and agricultural production, participated in accumulating and delivering fertilizer, rush harvesting and planting, afforestation and land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and basic construction of industry and transportation. Through this period of production, work, and labor practice, combined with self-education and self-transformation, most people have gained a further understanding of the greatness and correctness of the Party and the superiority of the socialist system from the Great Leap Forward in national construction, from the great development of enterprise production, and from their own practice. They gradually understood that only by accepting the leadership of the Party can they have their own future, and their relationship with the Party has moved a step closer than before. They are more concerned about socialist enterprises than before, and their sense of responsibility has gradually increased, and their thoughts and feelings have begun to change. In common labor and work with workers and peasants, they have gained some understanding of the noble qualities, infinite wisdom, and revolutionary spirit of the working people, and gradually changed their views and attitudes towards them. At the same time, because we have participated in labor training and socialist service work, the working people's perception of us has also changed, and the distance between us has begun to shorten. On this basis, after studying the General Line, many people have further enhanced their understanding and realized the new "three cannot be": the Communist Party cannot be separated from, the three cheers of long life cannot be reduced, and the service and transformation cannot be relaxed. These situations show that industrial and commercial circles in our province have made great progress under the leadership of the Party. However, this progress is only in comparison with our past situation. If we talk about the fundamental transformation from exploiters to laborers, it is still far from enough. Because the political standpoint of most of us has not been resolved, we still have varying degrees of doubts and wavering about accepting the leadership of the Party, and about the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Some people even have dissatisfaction or even resistance. This is obviously different from the attitude of the working people who love the Party, are wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, and resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies. In the work of serving socialism, many people are sometimes cold and sometimes hot, lack enthusiasm, and some even work without energy, with the idea of "living under someone else's roof" and "the past was better than the present." Many people are afraid of the tension and "difficulty" of continuous leaps forward, and some even hope that there will be less work and lower targets. Many people have a fear of difficulties in technical innovation and technical revolution, lack a positive attitude, and believe that it is better to do less than more. This is completely different from the thoughts and actions of the working people who are full of energy, working selflessly, trying every means to find tricks and tap potential, and vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution in order to change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland. In the relationship between individual interests and the interests of the country and the collective, the idea of "me first" and "selfishness first" is still quite common, and they often plan for personal interests and care about fame, status, and gains and losses. This is fundamentally different from the spirit of the working people who do not care about time or rewards, and are wholeheartedly working hard for the cause of the country and the people, and the communist style of "going to the front when there are difficulties, giving way when there is honor, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward." The above situations clearly show that although we industrialists and businessmen have made great progress on the road to socialism, the problem of two roads has not been resolved for most people, and duality still exists. This is far from adapted to the current rapidly developing objective situation. Therefore, we must continue to carry out the fundamental transformation of the bourgeois standpoint and worldview in order to master our own destiny and play our due role in the sustained Great Leap Forward.

    "Focusing on One End" and "Leaning to One Side" Are Key to the Continued Transformation of Industrialists and Businessmen

    Recently, the Party has educated us to "focus on one end" and "lean to one side" -- focusing on the end of national and people's interests, and leaning to the side of socialism. We believe that this is very timely and correct. This is the key issue for us industrialists and businessmen to continue to accept socialist transformation. Only by seriously and well resolving this issue can we further clarify the direction of progress and promote our own progress. At present, our country is in a new historical period of continued deepening of the socialist revolution and a great leap forward in socialist construction. The entire society is undergoing and will continue to undergo great changes. Everything capitalist will inevitably and completely be swept away in the end. This is the inevitable law of the development of our country's revolution and will not be transferred by people's will. We must recognize this law in order to truly master our own destiny and rush to a bright future, leaning to the side of socialism. Now, under the wise leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are fighting heroically to fundamentally change the "poor and blank" face of our country and rapidly build a modern industrial, modern agricultural, and modern scientific and cultural socialist power. In such a great situation, as a patriotic industrialist and businessman, we must unite with the people of the whole country, wholeheartedly serve the country, the people, and socialism, focus on the end of national and people's interests, and lean to the side of socialism. At the same time, we realize that "focusing on one end" and "leaning to one side" is entirely possible. With the leadership of the Party, the promotion of the Great Leap Forward, the help of the workers and masses, and the foundation of our progress over the past ten years and some conscious factors of taking the socialist road, the conditions are very favorable. As long as we are determined, we will definitely be able to achieve it. However, it should be noted that in the road of continuous progress, we will inevitably and often encounter the contradiction between individual interests and the interests of the country and the people. How to deal with this contradiction is related to the choice between two roads for us industrialists and businessmen. If we only care about individual interests and put individual interests above the interests of the country and the people, then we must adhere to the capitalist standpoint and take the capitalist road. Under the socialist system, it is not only unworkable and impossible, but also very dangerous. If we equate individual interests with the interests of the country and the people and take care of both ends, the result will inevitably be to lose the interests of the country and the people. Without the interests of the country and the people, individual interests cannot be taken care of. If we put individual interests in the position of subordinating to the interests of the country and the people, and wholeheartedly care about the interests of the country and lean to the side of socialism, then individual interests will also be taken care of. In fact, our political and economic interests have always been taken care of. Taking the situation in our province as an example, under the leadership of the Party, after the complete industry-wide public-private partnership, the Party and the government adopted a policy of taking over everything. According to the principle of "assigning jobs according to their talents and giving appropriate care," appropriate jobs were assigned to all industrialists and businessmen. Political arrangements were made for representatives at all levels, and many people held leading positions in state organs and enterprises at all levels. Fixed interest was paid on time. High salaries remained unchanged. Those with difficulties in family life, children's tuition fees, illness, death, etc., were taken care of and subsidized. Those who were truly old and sick and unable to participate in work also received their original salaries. When we inspected in Lezhi County and other areas, we learned that the Party and the government had taken care of all the difficulties of the industrial and commercial circles in life, old age, illness, and death, and the industrial and commercial circles expressed their infinite gratitude! In order to help us gradually transform into self-reliant laborers according to Chairman Mao's six political criteria, the Party often cares about our progress, and constantly patiently gives us education and help in combination with production and labor practice. Political schools or industrial and commercial training courses are held in provinces, cities, and special districts, so that we have the opportunity to learn systematic theory. We are constantly organized to visit and see the great achievements of socialist construction and the infinitely beautiful prospects of the motherland, and gradually realize that only by following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road, and doing something beneficial to the country and the people, can we truly be human and not "waste this life." And gradually understand the corrupt essence of the bourgeoisie and the view of life that only considers the interests of individuals and a small number of people is very shameful. At the same time, the Party has also trained our production, business, and technical abilities, so that those who had some skills have been improved, and those who had no skills have learned certain technologies and abilities. Many of them have become technicians, skilled workers, managers with business expertise, or all-around salespersons. Taking the nine transporters who were transferred to a factory in Chengdu as an example, four have been trained to become departmental or technical managers, and five have become level three or four skilled workers. Some of them have also been rated as advanced producers. Family members working in enterprises have also been rated as March 8th Red Banner Bearers in 1960. All of the above have made us further realize the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation. The Party and the government have not only always taken care of and taken over our economic and personal interests in life, but also have given meticulous care and attention to our political future and long-term interests. Recently, the Party pointed out to us again that "those who accept transformation are taken care of to the end in terms of life and work opportunities, and everything is taken care of to the end." Therefore, we should no longer consider the end of personal interests, and we must be determined to abandon the capitalist side; wholeheartedly go to the end of taking care of the interests of the country and the people and lean to the side of socialism.

    Ten Years of Practice Have Made Us Deeply Realize That: To Transform From Exploiters to Laborers and From a Capitalist Standpoint to a Socialist Standpoint, We Must Strive for Self-Education and Self-Transformation in Actively Serving Socialist Construction.

    Experience in Striving for Self-Education and Self-Transformation

    First, we must resolutely rely on the Communist Party and resolutely obey the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the most fundamental point. The Party is the core of leading all undertakings in our country and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. To transform ourselves into working people and resolve the contradiction between the two roads, relying on the Party and accepting the leadership of the Party is even more fundamental and core. The facts of the past ten years have proved that those who seriously accept the leadership of the Party have made greater progress; those who are half-hearted towards the Party have made slower progress; and those who do not accept the leadership of the Party have made no progress or even fallen into the quagmire of rightists. This shows that the Party is indeed indispensable and cannot be doubted, and cannot be falsified to the Party. We must resolutely believe in the Party, rely on the Party, be loyal and honest to the Party, tell the Party the truth, strive for the Party's education and help, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road.

    Second, we must continue to actively participate in production, work, and labor practice. At present, we must especially actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Make contributions to socialist construction and gradually establish the ideological feeling of loving socialism. Practice is the source of knowledge, and the improvement and consolidation of knowledge must go through repeated and continuous practice. Although we have gained a preliminary understanding of socialism and our thoughts and feelings have begun to change through the Party's education and training, we have engaged in capitalism for a long time and the practice of serving socialism is still too short. To truly understand socialism, we can only actively participate in the production and labor practice of serving socialism, compare the advantages and disadvantages of socialism and capitalism, resolve the contradiction between the two roads in our minds, gradually deepen our understanding of socialism, and establish the ideological feeling of loving socialism. And the improvement of understanding and the change of ideological feelings will promote our enthusiasm and drive, and better serve socialism. At present, the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the result of ideological revolution, and it will promote the continued deepening of ideological revolution. Actively participating in the torrent of this vigorous movement is indeed a great opportunity to transform our bourgeois standpoint, thinking, and worldview, learn and improve our technology and ability, and contribute our little culture, technology, and experience to serve the socialist motherland. Therefore, we must muster our energy and resolutely and actively participate in the practice of this great movement, and under the leadership of the Party, together with the working people, contribute all our strength to the rapid realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, changing the production face of our country, and building socialism at high speed.

    Third, we must conscientiously study political theories and current affairs policies, especially Chairman Mao's works. Thoroughly transform our bourgeois standpoint and worldview and master our own destiny. From the point of view of our fundamental transformation, practice is the main thing, but learning is also very important, because theory is the direction that guides practice. We must take the conscientious study of Chairman Mao's works as the guiding principle, study historical materialism, study the Party's various guidelines and policies, theoretically understand the laws of social development, and understand the truth that capitalism will inevitably perish and communism will inevitably win, constantly break the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and method, establish the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and gradually learn to use Marxism-Leninism to correctly observe and analyze things, overcome the bourgeois prejudice against everything, correctly determine our own actions, and actively move towards "focusing on one end" and "leaning to one side."

    Fourth, we must combine with the masses in our work, labor practice, and life. Thoroughly change the past views of despising labor, despising the working people, and fearing mass movements, shorten or even eliminate the distance between us and the working people, and gradually transform ourselves into glorious laborers. In the past labor practice, we have had preliminary understanding and gains. In the future, we must, on the basis of the past, be determined to go to the masses in the identity of ordinary laborers, integrate with the masses, work, labor, study, live, compete, and evaluate together, better accept the supervision and help of the workers and masses, learn the noble qualities of the workers and masses, gradually establish a labor point of view, develop labor habits, cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and create the necessary conditions for finally transforming ourselves into laborers.

    Finally, we realize that the work of industrial and commercial family members should be further strengthened. Practice has proved that their transformation and progress are interrelated, mutually influential, and mutually promoting with our transformation and progress. Since the Great Leap Forward, most industrial and commercial family members have participated in street work, production labor, and social services, embarking on the road of liberation and transformation. Our progress in the past two years as industrialists and businessmen is inseparable from their gains in practice. In the future, we must not only actively support and help them strive to participate in the practice and study of socialist construction, and strive to carry out self-transformation, but also work with them to actively participate in the urban people's commune movement to care for each other, help each other, and jointly move towards "focusing on one end" and "leaning to one side."

    This year is a year of continued Great Leap Forward in our country. The situation is very favorable for our transformation and service of industrialists and businessmen. We must wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, wholeheartedly serve socialism, and, together with the people of the whole country, strive to complete the 1960 national economic plan and strive to the end for the sustained leap forward of the socialist cause of the motherland!

专栏：

    一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务
    童少生、萧则可代表谈四川省工商业者的社会主义改造主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，并愿为其实现而努力。
    十年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们祖国的面貌已经起了巨大的变化。特别是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了人民公社和1958年的特大跃进，在此基础上，1959年又实现了全面、继续的大跃进，提前三年完成了发展国民经济第二个五年计划的主要指标，创造了震惊世界的奇迹。我们四川也和全国各地一样，在党的领导下，各个战线上都取得了辉煌成就。今年以来，全省人民响应党的号召，更加干劲冲天，“一条心、一股劲、一个样”地英勇前进。各方面的捷报随着春风不断传来，我们完全相信，1960年振奋人心的国民经济计划，一定能够胜利完成。在这样高速度的持续大跃进的伟大形势下，今后十年、八年，我们祖国必将起根本的变化，六亿多人民的物质生活和文化生活必将进一步提高。面对这样的大好形势，瞻望祖国无限美好的前途，我们的眼界放大了，心胸开阔了，精神更加愉快和振奋，使我们进一步认识到中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明、伟大和正确，社会主义制度的无比优越。
    四川省工商业者在党的领导下大有进步，但是这种进步还是很不够的
    随着国家的变化，我们工商界也起了深刻的变化。工商业者经历了全行业公私合营，改变了社会经济地位；经过了反右、整风运动的教育，认识了“共产党反不得、资本主义道路走不得、右派当不得”，政治思想亦有所提高。在此基础上，遵循党的指示，转入了生产、工作劳动实践。两年来，我省工商业者，在中共四川省委领导下，在一浪接一浪不断跃进的形势推动下，在职工群众的带动和帮助下，大多数人先后投入了大跃进行列，参加了为社会主义服务的工作。特别是党的八届八中全会后，响应了党的号召，在大战8、9月为国庆献礼，决战四季度争取“满堂红”和今年“开门红”的各次运动中，和工人一道，一般都能够完成自己担负的任务。对技术革新和技术革命，不少人与职工结合，围绕“三高一低”（高质、高产、高功效、低成本）安全生产，支援农业的要求，在试制新产品，找寻代用品，改进生产设备，提高生产效率，提高产品质量，节约原料材料等方面，作了不少工作，其中有些人成绩还比较显著。与以前相比，工作积极的人数增加了，革新建议的项目增多了，增产节约的数值也增大了。如自贡市工商界1959年1至11月就提出合理化建议一万二千多条，节约价值约达一百二十多万元；各地被评为先进生产者、先进工作者的人数也逐渐增加。在这段时期中，绝大多数工商业者都参加了劳动锻炼，很多人下车间、上柜台，在“两参一改三结合”中，实行了跟班劳动，改变了过去的作风；不少人响应了党的支援工农业生产的号召，参加了积肥送肥、抢收抢种、植树垦荒、兴修水利，以及工业交通等基本建设的劳动。通过这段时期的生产工作劳动实践，结合进行自我教育、自我改造，多数人从国家建设事业的大跃进中，从企业生产的大发展中，从自己的实践中，对党的伟大、正确，社会主义制度的优越，有了进一步的认识；逐渐懂得了只有接受党的领导才有自己的前途，与党的关系较前靠拢了一步；对社会主义企业较前关心，责任感也逐渐有所增加，思想感情开始起了变化；在与工农群众一道共同劳动和工作中，对劳动人民的高贵品质、无穷智慧和革命干劲有所认识，逐步改变了对他们的看法和态度，同时，由于我们参加了劳动锻炼和社会主义服务的工作，劳动人民对我们的观感也有所改变，开始缩短了彼此之间的距离。在此基础上，经过总路线的学习，不少人进一步提高了认识，体会到新的“三不得”，就是共产党离不得，三个万岁少不得，服务改造松不得。这些情况，说明我省工商界在党的领导下是大有进步的。但是，这种进步，只是同我们过去的情况比较而言，如果从剥削者变为劳动者的根本改造来说，还是很不够的。由于我们多数人的政治立场问题还没有解决，对接受党的领导，对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，还有不同程度的疑虑、动摇，有些人还有不满以至抵触；这和劳动人民热爱党、对党一心一意，坚决贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策的态度，显然是不同的。在为社会主义服务的工作中，许多人是时冷时热，干劲不足，有的甚至干而无劲，存在着“寄人篱下”和“今不如昔”的思想；不少人对持续跃进怕紧张“老火”，有些人甚至希望工作越少越好，指标越低越好；不少人对技术革新和技术革命存在畏难情绪，缺乏积极态度，认为多一事不如少一事；这和劳动人民为了改变祖国“一穷二白”面貌，干劲冲天，忘我劳动，千方百计找窍门、挖潜力，大搞技术革新，大闹技术革命的思想行动，是迥然不同的。在对待个人利益同国家、集体利益的关系上，还相当普遍的是“我字当头”、“私字当先”，经常为个人利益打算，计较名誉地位、利害得失；这和劳动人民不计时间、不计报酬，一心一意为国家、人民事业而艰苦奋斗的精神，和“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见落后就帮”的共产主义风格，是根本不同的。以上这些情况，清楚地说明我们工商业者在向社会主义前进的道路上，虽然有了大的进步，但多数人两条道路的问题还没有解决，两面性仍然存在。这与当前飞跃发展的客观形势是远远不相适应的。因此，我们必须继续进行资产阶级立场和世界观的根本改造，才能掌握自己命运，才能在持续大跃进中发挥自己应有的作用。
    “顾一头”、“一边倒”，是工商业者继续接受改造的关键
    最近，党教育我们要“顾一头”、“一边倒”，——顾国家人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。我们认为这是非常适时的、正确的，这是我们工商业者继续接受社会主义改造的关键问题，只有认真地、很好地解决这个问题，才能进一步明确前进的方向，促进自己的进步。当前，我国正处在社会主义革命继续深入、社会主义建设大跃进的新的历史时期中，整个社会正在发生并且将继续发生伟大的变革，资本主义的一切东西都必将最后地、彻底地被扫除，这是我国革命发展的必然规律，不以人们的意志为转移的。我们必须认清这个规律，才能真正掌握自己的命运，奔向光明前途，倒向社会主义一边。现在，全国人民在党的英明领导下，为了根本改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，迅速建成现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国而英勇奋斗。在这样伟大的形势下，作为一个爱国的工商业者，必须要同全国人民一道，一心一意为国家、为人民、为社会主义服务，顾国家人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。同时，我们认识到“顾一头”、“一边倒”是完全可能做到的。有党的领导，有大跃进形势的推动，有工人群众的帮助，还有我们十年来进步的基础和走社会主义道路的一些自觉的因素，条件十分有利，只要我们下定决心，就一定能够实现。但应当注意的是我们在继续前进的道路上，不可避免地要经常遇到个人利益同国家人民利益的矛盾，如何处理这个矛盾，是关系到我们工商业者在两条道路之间的抉择问题。如果只顾个人利益，把个人利益摆在国家、人民利益之上，那必然是坚持资本主义立场，走资本主义的道路，在社会主义制度下，不仅是行不通、办不到，而且也是非常危险的；如果将个人利益与国家、人民利益等量齐观、两头兼顾，其结果必然会丢掉国家、人民的利益，没有国家人民的利益，个人利益这一头也是顾不到的；如果我们把个人利益摆在服从国家人民利益的地位，一心一意顾国家利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边，这样，个人利益也会得到照顾。事实上，我们在政治上、经济上的利益是一直得到照顾的。就以我省的情况来看，在党的领导下，在全行业公私合营后，党和政府采取了包下来的政策，根据“量才录用、适当照顾”的原则，对所有的工商业者都分配了适当的工作；对各级代表人物都作了政治安排，不少人担任了国家机关和企业的各级领导职务；定息按期发给；高薪不变；家庭生活、子女学费、疾病、死亡等有困难的，都得到照顾、补助；真正年老、疾病不能参加工作的也照支原薪。我们在乐至县和其他地区视察时，了解到党和政府把工商界生、老、病、死的一切困难都包下来了，工商界表示了无限感激的心情！党为了帮助我们按照毛主席指示的六项政治标准，逐步改造成为自食其力的劳动者，经常关心我们的进步，结合生产劳动实践，不断耐心地给我们教育和帮助；在省、市各专区都举办了政治学校或工商讲习班，使我们得到系统理论学习的机会；并不断组织参观访问，使我们看到了社会主义建设的伟大成就和祖国无限美好的前景，逐渐认识到我们只有跟着共产党走社会主义道路，做些对国家人民有益的事，才算真正作人，不“虚此一生”；并逐渐懂得资产阶级的腐朽本质，一生只为个人利益和一小撮人利益打算的人生观，是非常可耻的。同时，党还对我们进行了生产业务技术能力的培养，使原来有些技能的得到提高，原来无一技之长的，也学到一定的技术、能力，其中不少人还成了技术人员、技工、有业务专长的管理人员或全能营业员。仅就转业到成都的一个工厂的九个贩运商来说，有四人已经培养成为科室或技术管理人员，五人成为三、四级技工，其中有的还被评为先进生产者。在企业工作的家属，有的还被评为1960年三八红旗手。以上这些，使我们进一步认识到党的和平改造政策的伟大、正确。党和政府不仅对我们经济、生活上个人利益一直是照顾的，包下来的，而且对我们政治前途、长远利益也是无微不至的关怀和照顾的。最近，党又向我们指出，“对接受改造的工商业者在生活上和工作机会上照顾到底，包到底。”因此，我们更不应该再考虑个人利益那一头，要决心抛弃资本主义那一边；一心一意地奔向顾国家人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边。
    十年来的实践，我们深刻体会到：要从剥削者改造成为劳动者、从资本主义立场转到社会主义立场，还必须在积极为社会主义建设服务中努力进行自我教育和自我改造。
    努力进行自我教育和自我改造的体会
    首先，要坚决靠拢共产党，坚决服从共产党的领导，这是最根本的一条。党是领导我们国家一切事业的核心，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利的根本保证。我们要改造成为劳动人民，解决两条道路的矛盾，依靠党、接受党的领导，更是根本的根本，核心的核心。十年来的事实证明：凡是认真接受党的领导的进步就较大；对党三心二意的进步就较慢；不接受党的领导的就没有进步甚至堕入右派泥坑。这说明：党确是离不得的、疑不得的，对党是假不得的。我们一定要坚决相信党，靠拢党，对党忠诚老实，向党说真心话，争取党的教育和帮助，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义的道路。
      其次，要继续积极投入生产工作劳动实践，在当前，特别要积极投入以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。为社会主义建设作出贡献，逐步树立热爱社会主义的思想感情。实践是认识的源泉，认识的提高和巩固，必须经过反复不断的实践。我们经过党的教育培养，虽然对社会主义有了初步认识，思想感情也开始起了些变化，但搞资本主义的时间很长，为社会主义服务的实践还为时很短。要真正认识社会主义，只有积极参加到为社会主义服务的生产劳动实践中去，对比社会主义和资本主义的优劣，在思想上解决两条道路的矛盾，逐步加深对社会主义的认识，树立热爱社会主义的思想感情；而认识的提高，思想感情的变化，又将促进我们的热情和干劲，更好的为社会主义服务。当前，技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃开展，正是思想革命的结果，而又将推动思想革命的继续深入，积极投入这一轰轰烈烈运动的洪流中去，确是改造我们的资产阶级立场、思想和世界观，学习和提高技术、能力，把我们自己的一点文化技术、经验贡献出来为社会主义祖国服务的大好时机。因此，我们一定要鼓足干劲，坚决地、积极地投入这一伟大运动的实践中去，在党的领导下，和劳动人民一道，为迅速实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，改变我们国家的生产面貌，高速度的建设社会主义而贡献出自己的一切力量。
    第三，要认真学习政治理论和时事政策，特别是毛主席的著作。彻底改造我们的资产阶级立场和世界观，掌握自己的命运。从我们的根本改造来说，实践是主要的，学习也是很重要的，因为理论是指导实践的方向。我们一定要以认真学习毛主席的著作为纲，学习历史唯物论，学习党的各项方针政策，从理论上认识社会发展规律，认识资本主义必然灭亡、共产主义必然胜利的道理，不断地破资产阶级的立场、观点、方法，立无产阶级的立场、观点、方法，逐步学会运用马克思列宁主义来正确地观察和分析事物，克服资产阶级对待一切事物的偏见，正确地决定自己的行动，积极奔向“顾一头”、“一边倒”。
    第四，我们要在工作劳动实践以及生活中和群众相结合。彻底改变过去轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民、害怕群众运动的观点，缩短以至消除与劳动人民之间的距离，逐步把自己改造成为光荣的劳动者。在过去的劳动实践中，我们已有初步的认识和收获，今后，一定要在过去的基础上，下定决心，以普通劳动者的身份，到群众中去，与群众打成一片，同工作、同劳动、同学习、同生活、同竞赛、同评比，更好地接受工人群众的监督、帮助，学习工人群众的高贵品质，逐步树立劳动观点、养成劳动习惯，培养劳动人民的思想感情，为最后把我们改造成为劳动者创造必要的条件。
    最后，我们体会，工商家属的工作应该进一步加强。实践证明：她们的改造和进步，是与我们的改造和进步相互关联、相互影响、相互促进的。大跃进以来，多数工商家属都参加街道工作、生产劳动和社会服务，走上了解放和改造的道路。我们工商业者这两年来的进步是与她们在实践中的收获分不开的。今后，我们既要积极支持和帮助她们努力参加社会主义建设的实践和学习，努力进行自我改造，我们还要和她们一起积极投入城市人民公社运动中去互相关心，互相帮助，共同奔向“顾一头”、“一边倒”。
    今年是我们国家继续大跃进的一年，形势对我们工商业者的改造和服务都是十分有利的，我们一定要一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟共产党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务，同全国人民一道，为完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗，为祖国的社会主义事业的持续跃进而奋斗到底！
