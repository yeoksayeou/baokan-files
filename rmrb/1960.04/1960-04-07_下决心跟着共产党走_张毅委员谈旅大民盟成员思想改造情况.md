Determined to Follow the Communist Party

Comrade Zhang Yi Discusses the Ideological Remolding of Members of the China Democratic League in Lüda

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am extremely excited to participate in the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the meeting, I listened to the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the "Report on the Final State Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960" by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference" by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I was greatly educated and encouraged. I fully endorse these reports. Here, I would like to report to the conference on the political and ideological situation of the members of the China Democratic League's Lüda Municipal Committee, and I welcome your criticism and suggestions.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country have been full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm, bringing about earth-shaking changes in our motherland and achieving monumental achievements in socialist construction and socialist revolution. The situation is infinitely bright, and the future is full of promise. Encouraged and propelled by this great situation, and under the Party's constant and patient education, our members of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, like democrats all over the country, have also made great progress in their political thinking. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, in terms of accepting the Party's leadership, most people have gradually come to understand, through studying political theory, through the rapid progress of national construction, and through the practice of their own work, that it is necessary to accept the Party's leadership in order to have direction, methods, and a future. Most people are gradually willing to approach and get closer to the Party organizations and members. In their work, they are more able to respond to the Party's calls, obey work assignments, and report to the Party for instructions. Second, in terms of taking the socialist road, they have realized, through the Anti-Rightist struggle and rectification campaign, that the capitalist road is a dead end. In the past two years, thanks to seeing the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production and the tremendous power of the people's communes, and also through studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, their understanding of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes has been greatly enhanced. Their understanding of the superiority of socialism has been further deepened, and their belief in taking the socialist road has been greatly strengthened compared to before. Their enthusiasm and initiative in serving socialism have significantly improved, especially their willingness to participate in revolutionary mass movements compared to before. The mistaken view that mass movements would disrupt normal order has been overcome to a considerable extent. Third, in terms of participating in labor and political study: through labor training, the idea of looking down on labor and the working people has been significantly overcome. Political study is generally more valued than before, and they are also more able to connect with reality in their studies. There has also been some progress in criticism and self-criticism compared to before.

All of these indicate that the members of the China Democratic League in Lüda have made great progress in their political thinking. This is an achievement made under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is a great victory for the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals. However, it should also be pointed out that the great progress of our League members is in comparison with the past. The dual nature of most League members still exists, with both socialist and capitalist aspects. For the fundamental transformation from bourgeois intellectuals to working-class intellectuals, this progress is still far from enough. Most people still have varying degrees of doubts and wavering about accepting the Party's leadership, about the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and some even have dissatisfaction and resistance. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have made. In order to adapt to the development of the situation, we must continue to strengthen political remolding and, at the same time, carry out the remolding of our world outlook. Especially now that our country is in a new historical period of continuing deep socialist revolution and continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. In this new historical period, all remnants of capitalism, not only in the economy but also in politics, ideology, and all other fields, will be finally and completely swept away. This period will be a long, complex, and sometimes even fierce historical process of struggle, and it will be a serious test for each of us. The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals is unwavering. The problem is that we must accept this policy, we must completely abandon the bourgeois stand, completely change the bourgeois world outlook, and truly establish the proletarian stand and world outlook, and cultivate proletarian thoughts and feelings.

Completely abandon individualism, completely abandon the egoistic world outlook. This is the primary issue for us to accept socialist remolding at present. Individualism is the most essential thing in the bourgeois stand, and it is now the object of revolution, but it still stubbornly manifests itself in our thoughts, words, or actions in various ways. This is a serious obstacle on our road forward. We must resolutely struggle against it and completely break with it without any mercy. Individualism has many manifestations. Giving undue weight to personal interests, placing too much importance on personal interests, overestimating personal roles, wanting to be superior to others in relationships, and being unwilling to be a member of the masses all fall within the scope of individualism. But the concentrated manifestation is in the relationship with the Party. First of all, most of us cannot be consistent with the Party in politics and ideology, truly loving what the Party loves and hating what the Party hates. We lack a deep understanding of the Party's guidelines, policies, and instructions, let alone proactively implementing them. Originally, under our socialist system, it is entirely possible and objectively inevitable to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward. However, most of us do not engage in socialist construction with the same spirit and soaring enthusiasm as our worker and peasant brothers, but instead feel that the construction speed is too fast and the work is too intense, hoping that the speed will slow down a bit and that life will be easier. Some people also believe that striving to be at the top is not so easy, and it is not good to lose face by being at the bottom, so it is better to be in the middle. Secondly, in terms of organization, we still cannot wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. Some people are not convinced because the branch secretary is young, or is their own student, and are unwilling to accept leadership. Thirdly, there is still distance and estrangement in thoughts and feelings with the Party. We still cannot regard the Party as our own family members, telling the Party our true feelings in everything, talking about everything. In action, we still lack a high degree of consciousness and initiative, and cannot truly be the Party's obedient tools.

Generally speaking, because of the existence of individualism, we cannot be of one heart and one mind with the Party, truly achieving "leaning to one side." The Party represents the interests of the people, and since we cannot be of one heart and one mind with the Party, it is impossible to wholeheartedly serve the people and serve socialism under the Party's leadership.

Now, under the leadership of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee and the Party organizations of various units, and with the active support and help of the CPPCC Lüda Municipal Committee, the intellectual circles, industrial and commercial circles, and members of democratic parties in Lüda City are holding various forms of study sessions in order to clarify their political and ideological outlook, to further understand the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and to further mobilize their enthusiasm, further move closer to the Party, and be determined to "lean to one side." The method of study is gentle and meticulous criticism and self-criticism, multi-faceted guidance, mutual enlightenment, revealing objectively existing problems on the basis of constantly improving awareness, carrying out free debate, presenting facts, reasoning, analyzing problems, and solving problems.

Past experience has shown that when we have a clear understanding of our own political and ideological outlook, we can overcome complacency while eliminating inferiority, and we can clarify further remolding tasks. This is beneficial to self-remolding. Past experience has also shown that when we clarify our political and ideological outlook and improve our understanding of the Party's guidelines and policies, our mood becomes more cheerful and our enthusiasm increases. This is also very beneficial for mobilizing enthusiasm for serving socialism.

In general, encouraged by the infinitely beautiful situation at home and abroad, and under the Party's constant education, the members of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League have made great progress in their political thinking in recent years, but they still need to be remolded in order to adapt to the development of the situation. We believe that as long as we closely rely on the Party's leadership, rely on the masses, make up our minds, move resolutely in the direction pointed out by the Party, resolutely throw ourselves into the Great Leap Forward, resolutely throw ourselves into the torrent of mass movements, actively participate in labor, study diligently, and constantly strive, we will be able to realize the glorious task of fundamental transformation and become both red and expert working-class intellectuals.

    下决心跟着共产党走
    张毅委员谈旅大民盟成员思想改造情况主席、各位委员：
    我以极其兴奋的心情，参加了中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议。在会议中，听到了李富春副总理所作“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”以及陈叔通副主席所作“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。我完全拥护这些报告。在这里，我拟向大会汇报一下中国民主同盟旅大市委员会所属成员的政治思想情况，请予以批评指正。
    几年来，全国人民在党的领导下，意气风发，干劲冲天，使我们祖国发生了翻天复地的变化，取得了社会主义建设和社会主义革命惊天动地的成就。真是形势无限美好，前途光芒万丈。在这样伟大形势的鼓舞和推动之下，在党的不断耐心教育下，我们旅大市民盟成员和全国各地民主人士一样，在政治思想上也有了很大的进步。这主要表现在：第一，在接受党的领导方面，多数人从政治理论的学习中，从国家建设的飞跃进展中，从自己服务的实践中，逐渐懂得，一定要接受党的领导，才会有方向，有办法，有前途。多数人对党的组织和党员，逐步愿意靠拢和接近了。在工作上，比较能够响应党的号召，服从工作分配和向党请示汇报了。第二，在走社会主义道路方面，通过反右和整风，认识到资本主义道路走不得。两年多以来，由于看到了工农业生产的高速度发展，人民公社的巨大威力，又由于通过党的八届八中全会文件的学习，对总路线、大跃进和人民公社，在认识上有了很大的提高。对于社会主义的优越性有了进一步的体会，因而对于走社会主义道路的信念比以前大大增强了，为社会主义服务的热情和积极性显著提高了，特别是对革命性的群众运动比以前愿意参加了。原来以为群众运动会破坏正常秩序的错误看法，在相当程度上已有所克服。第三，在参加劳动和政治学习方面：通过劳动锻炼，轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民的思想有了比较显著的克服。对政治学习一般比以前重视了，而且在学习中也比较能联系实际了。对批评与自我批评也较前有了一定的进展。
     所有这些，说明了旅大市盟员在政治思想上是大有进步了。这是毛主席思想光辉照耀下所取得的成果，是党对知识分子团结教育改造政策的伟大胜利。但是也应指出，我们盟员的大有进步，是同过去的情况比较而言。多数盟员的两面性仍然存在，既有社会主义的一面，也有资本主义的一面。对于从资产阶级知识分子转变为工人阶级知识分子的根本改造来说，这个进步还是很不够的。多数人对于接受党的领导，对于总路线、大跃进和人民公社还有不同程度的疑虑、动摇，有些人还有不满以至抵触。因此，我们还不能满足于已有的成绩，为了适应形势的发展，还必须继续加强政治上的改造，同时进行世界观的改造。特别是目前我国正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设持续大跃进的新的历史时期。在这个新的历史时期中，资本主义的一切残余，不仅在经济上，而且在政治上、思想上以及其他一切领域，都将最后地彻底被扫除。这个时期将是一个长期的、复杂的、而且有时还是激烈的斗争的历史过程，对于我们每个人都将是一个严重的考验。党对知识分子团结教育改造的政策是坚定不移的。问题在于我们必须接受这个政策，必须彻底放弃资产阶级立场，彻底改变资产阶级世界观，真正树立起无产阶级的立场和世界观，培养无产阶级的思想感情。
    彻底抛弃个人主义，彻底抛弃唯我主义世界观。这是我们当前接受社会主义改造的首要问题。个人主义是资产阶级立场最本质的东西，现在是革命对象，但它仍然顽强地在我们的思想上，言语上或行动上从各方面表现出来。这是我们在前进道路上一个严重障碍。我们必须毫不留情地和它进行坚决的斗争和彻底的决裂。个人主义的表现是多方面的。偏重个人利益，对个人利益看得重，偏重个人作用，对个人作用估计过高，和人的关系是要高人一等，不甘于做群众中的一员等等都属于个人主义的范围。但集中的表现是在对党的关系上。首先，我们中间多数人在政治上，思想上不能和党一致，真正做到党所爱者爱之，党所恶者恶之。对党的方针、政策和指示无深刻的体会，更不能主动地加以贯彻。本来在我国社会主义制度下，用大跃进的速度发展国民经济，是完全可能的，是客观的必然性。但是我们中间多数人却不像工人、农民兄弟那样，意气风发，干劲冲天，从事于社会主义建设事业，而是觉得建设速度太快，工作太紧张，希望速度减慢一点，日子过得轻松一点，也有人认为，力争上游，不那么容易，而居于下游，面子又不好看，还是来个中游的好。其次，在组织上，对党的基层组织的领导，还不能做到心悦诚服。有人因为支部书记年纪轻，或者是自己的学生，就不心服，就不愿接受领导。第三，在思想感情上和党还有距离，还有隔阂。还不能把党看做自己亲人一样，事事和党说真心话，无所不谈。在行动上，还缺乏高度自觉性和积极性，不能真正做党的驯服工具。
    总的说来，由于有个人主义存在，就不能和党一条心，真正做到“顾一头”“一边倒”。党是代表人民利益的，既然和党不能一条心，也就不可能在党的领导下，一心一意为人民服务，为社会主义服务。
    现在旅大市知识界、工商界和民主党派成员在中共旅大市委和各单位党组织的领导下，在政协旅大市委员会的积极支持与帮助下，正在召开各种形式的学习会，以求弄清自己的政治思想面貌，以求对党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社有进一步的认识，以求达到进一步调动积极性，进一步靠拢党，下定决心，“顾一头”“一边倒”的目的。学习的方法就是和风细雨批评，自我批评的方法，多方诱导，互相启发，在不断提高自觉的基础上揭露客观存在的问题，开展自由辩论，摆事实，讲道理，分析问题，解决问题。
    过去的经验表明：当我们对于自己的政治、思想面貌有了明确的认识以后，就能克服自满，同时消除自卑，并能明确进一步的改造任务。这对于自我改造是有利的。过去的经验也表明，当我们弄清了自己的政治思想面貌，对党的方针政策在认识上有所提高以后，心情也就舒畅了，干劲也就加大了。这对于调动为社会主义服务的积极性也是非常有利的。
    总的说来，我们旅大市民盟成员在国内外无限美好的形势的鼓舞下，在党的不断教育下，几年来，在政治思想上大有进步，但仍须改造，才能适应形势的发展。我们相信只要紧紧依靠党的领导，依靠群众，下定决心，朝着党所指引的方向，坚决投入大跃进行列中去，坚决投入群众运动洪流中去，积极劳动，认真学习，不断努力，我们是能够实现根本改造的光荣任务的，是能够成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的。
