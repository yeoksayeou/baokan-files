Comrades Representatives:

We fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin.

The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, like that across the country, has unfolded magnificently, forming a region-wide upsurge. The situation of the movement is excellent. Not only has a vigorous mass movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation emerged on the industrial, transportation, and capital construction fronts, but it has also rapidly and widely spread to all aspects of the agricultural, financial and trade, cultural and educational, and health fronts. The momentum of the movement, the speed of its progress, the breadth of its mobilization, and the richness of its content are all unprecedented. Many industrial and mining enterprises and capital construction sites have developed from single-item tool innovations to complete sets of reforms, from individual, individual types of work, and individual process innovations to systematic and comprehensive innovations in the entire technological process, and from general rationalization proposals and general simple tool reforms to an advance toward mechanization, automation, and linkage. The results are significant and immediately effective. The masses describe it as: "The arrival of a great storm, a revolution every minute." The backward appearance of enterprises has been rapidly changed further, and it has greatly promoted the overall sustained great leap forward in production. This is a movement with great political and economic significance, especially in view of the weak industrial base in our region, this is a good start to a great revolutionary change.

In the past two or three months, in the industrial and mining enterprises in our region, a large number of manual operations have been changed to mechanization and semi-mechanization, and many workers have been freed from heavy physical labor. According to statistics from 632 industrial and mining enterprises above the county level, by the beginning of March, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization had increased from the original 30.4% to 45.4%, an increase of 15% in a short period, freeing more than 23,000 people from heavy physical labor and manual operations. According to statistics from four cities by the end of February, thirty-one factories and seventy-three workshops have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, realizing 34,525 innovations. On the basis of mechanization and semi-mechanization, 804 single-machine automatic lathes, 120 automatic production lines, and 260 automatic operation lines have emerged throughout the region. Many problems that were previously considered difficult to solve, or projects that had been tested many times without success, have been quickly resolved in this great mass movement in just a few days or ten days. For example, cold forging in the mechanical industry used to be mostly done by swinging sledgehammers, but now most of them have been replaced by mechanical such as splint hammers and spring hammers. In the four cities of Nanning and other major machinery factories in our region, forgers have all abandoned the sledgehammer, and foundry workers have also eliminated shoulder carrying and replaced them with various mechanical equipment. In many enterprises, internal and external transportation has been realized with vehicles and rails, and various motorized and electric vehicles have been created to replace the heavy physical transportation of the past. The staff and workers are very happy, saying: "In the past, swinging a sledgehammer made our backs ache, but now using machines is easy and relaxing," and their enthusiasm is even greater.

It is particularly worth mentioning that our region used to have mostly handicraft factories with no technical equipment foundation. For example, making rice noodles, rope, spinning yarn, splitting bamboo strips, and grinding tofu have been manual workshops for many years. Workers often mentioned: "There are three hardships in the world: steaming noodles, making rope, and grinding tofu." Now, factories such as rice noodle factories, tofu factories, and coir rope factories in Liuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin have all been renovated after only a few weeks of effort and have realized mechanized and linked production. Rice goes in one end and noodles come out the other, which is something people could not have imagined in the past. The staff and workers are jubilant and sing praises of the good of technical innovation everywhere. In the past, most of the woodworking factories were manual operations, but now many factories have workers putting down handsaws, hand planes, hand files and axes, and the sound of machines can be heard everywhere. There are also many enterprises that have always been old key and weak links in production history, but have been broken through and resolved in this movement. For example, the sizing section of the Guilin Weaving Factory used to be manual operation and relied on sun drying. When the weather was bad and it rained continuously, the entire factory would have to shut down and wait. Recently, a combined sizing machine was successfully manufactured, changing nine processes into one, and one machine can supply yarn for 150 machines, thus ending the history of manual operation and fundamentally solving the old key of production "relying on the weather." There are many similar examples.

The equipment of many enterprises has been comprehensively innovated and transformed during the movement. They have manufactured a large number of special equipment and special tools themselves, solving many key problems in production that could not be solved in the past, thus rapidly improving labor productivity. For example, the Nanning Hardware Products Factory self-made molds for stamping shovels, increasing work efficiency by 113 times; the Guilin Match Factory made a box-pasting machine, which can replace the labor of 60 people with one machine. During the movement, not only did labor productivity greatly improve, but some also greatly saved raw materials after the innovation.

The effectiveness of technical innovation and technical revolution has greatly promoted the high-speed development of production. The total industrial output value of our region increased by 86.97% in January compared to the same period last year, and increased by 19.87% compared to December last year, while February increased by 7.6% compared to January, with production exceeding month by month. According to the current level, the planned task of total industrial output value of our region this year can be completed by existing enterprises alone. If the newly built enterprises put into production this year are added, our region will surely be able to greatly over fulfill this year's industrial production tasks. This is enough to prove that by giving full play to the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of staff and workers to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, industrial production and construction will surely be able to develop at high speed.

Like the excellent situation in industrial and mining enterprises, a vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has also been launched on the agricultural front in the vast rural areas of our region. Whether in the plains or mountainous areas, whether in Han areas or minority areas, the people of all ethnic groups are carrying out innovation and creation under the leadership of the Party in a fiery manner. In the rice paddy areas, rice transplanters have been widely promoted in spring planting, greatly saving manpower and advancing the season. In remote mountainous areas, a large-scale movement to reform complete sets of agricultural tools to replace human power with water and animal power has also been carried out. For example, Jingxi and other counties have basically realized the vehicle transportation and semi-mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing. Daxin County has realized the hydropower of processing and is gradually striving for hydropower electrification. In the past, Du'an Yao Autonomous County used manual processing for corn, which cost a lot of labor. The canteens in the entire autonomous county arranged more than 11,000 laborers just to grind corn, and some women needed to work overtime at night. After technical innovation, the water and animal power chain grinding has been basically realized. Only more than 2,000 cattle and more than 1,100 laborers are needed, thus adding tens of thousands of laborers to the agricultural production front. Women do not have to carry their babies to pound rice at night and have time to learn culture. Transportation, in agricultural production in mountainous areas, has always been a major problem, and in this mass movement, many areas have also achieved preliminary solutions. For example, Oudong Commune in Xincheng County is a mountainous area with "a bump every five steps and a dip every ten steps." They built 303 main roads, extending 670 li, conquering rugged and dangerous passes, and finding a way for vehicles to travel in mountainous areas. When they were promoting ox carts, they found that the original old-fashioned large-wheeled ox carts could not climb slopes or descend hills. They tried their best to study how to adapt them to the characteristics of mountainous areas, and now they have been modified into small-wheeled ox carts that "do not require effort to go uphill and can be controlled downhill." They have been promptly and comprehensively promoted, and 95% of the teams in the commune can use them to transport fertilizer, ensuring the fertilizer needs of the commune's early corn expansion this year, which is more than ten times greater than in the past. The people of all ethnic groups at the Chengbihe Reservoir in Baise, through vigorously carrying out tool reform and making various transportation tools, can no longer see the situation of carrying soil on shoulders and backs as before October last year. Work efficiency has been increasing day by day, and the earthwork engineering at the dam head has continuously increased from more than 7,000 cubic meters per day to 20,000, 25,000, and broke through to 30,000 cubic meters, which will enable the project to be completed much earlier.

The rapid progress and achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution in our region are a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction and the people's communes, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. In practice, it has further liberated the minds of the people of all ethnic groups in our region, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do has been developed, and the mental outlook of the people has been greatly changed. Communist cooperation has been further carried out among the various ethnic groups, with mutual visits and learning, mutual evaluation and competition, and socialist ethnic relations have been further developed. Practice has also fully demonstrated that science and technology are not unattainable. As long as we liberate our minds and muster greater efforts, the backward appearance of technology can be quickly changed. The people are more eager to make revolution the poorer they are and more eager to innovate the busier they are. As long as we continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution, and grasp the movement tightly and well, we can make this vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement develop forward with higher and higher waves, and achieve greater and more comprehensive victories.

    广西僮族自治区掀起了技术革命风暴
    梁华新、程曙天代表谈广西技术革命大好形势各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。
    广西僮族自治区技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，和全国各地一样，已经波澜壮阔地开展起来，形成了全区性的高潮。运动的形势很好，不仅在工业、交通运输、基本建设战线上出现了以机械化半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的群众运动的磅礴局面，而且在农业、财贸、文教卫生等战线的各个方面，同样迅速广泛的展开。运动声势之大，进展之快，发动面之广，内容之丰富，都是前所未有的。许多工矿企业和基本建设工地，由过去单项机具革新发展到成列成套的改革，由个别人、个别工种、个别工序的革新发展到整个工艺过程系统全面的革新，由一般的合理化建议，一般的简易的机具改革发展到机械化、自动化、联动化的进军，战绩显著，立竿见影，群众把它形容为：“大风暴的到来，一分钟革个命”。企业落后的面貌迅速获得了进一步的改变，并且大大地推动了生产的全面持续大跃进，这是一次富有重大政治意义和经济意义的运动，特别在我区工业基础薄弱的状况来说，这是一次伟大的革命性变化的良好开端。
    两三个月来，在我区的工矿企业中，大量的手工操作改变为机械化半机械化，许多工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。据六百三十二个县以上工矿企业的统计，到3月上旬止，机械化半机械化的程度在原来30.4％的基础上，已提高到45.4％，短短时间内提高了15％，使二万三千多人摆脱了笨重体力劳动和手工操作。据四个市到2月底的统计，已基本实现机械化半机械化的有三十一个工厂，七十三个车间，实现革新三万四千五百二十五项，在机械化半机械化的基础上，全区涌现出单机自动化车床八百零四台，生产自动线一百二十条，自动作业线二百六十条。许多过去认为难以解决的问题，或者经过了多次试验而未成功的项目，在这次伟大的群众运动中，仅几天或十几天之内，就迅速地得到了解决。如像机械工业的冷锻工，原来多数是抡大锤的，现在大都已经用夹板锤、弹簧锤等机械代替了。我区的南宁等四市以及其他主要的机械厂，锻工已都甩掉了大锤，铸工也消灭了肩挑人抬，换上了各种机械设备，许多企业，厂内外的运输已实现了车子化、轨道化，还创造了各种各样的机动车电动车等，代替了过去的笨重体力运输。职工群众非常高兴，说：“过去抡大锤，腰酸背痛，现在用机器，轻轻松松”，越干劲头越大了。
    特别值得提到的，我区过去多是一些手工业工厂，没有什么技术设备基础。如像做米粉、打绳、摇纱、破竹篾、磨豆腐，多少年来都是手工作坊，从来就没有摸过机器，工人们常提到：“天下有三苦，蒸粉、打绳、磨豆腐”；而现在，如像柳州、南宁、桂林等地的粉丝厂、豆腐厂、棕绳厂，只经过几周的努力，已全部换上了新装，实现了机械化、联动化生产。大米这头进，粉条那边出，这是人们过去想像不到的事情。职工群众欢欣鼓舞，到处歌唱技术革新好。过去大部分是手工操作的木工厂，现在也有不少的厂，工人放下了手锯、手刨和手锉、斧头，到处是一片机器声。还有许多企业在生产历史上一直是老关键和薄弱环节的，在这次运动中，也被突破而获得了解决。如桂林市织布厂的浆纱工段，过去既是手工操作，又是靠太阳晒干，碰到天公不作美而连绵下雨，全厂就要为此而停机等待，而最近制成功了一台联合浆纱机，一变九道工序为一道工序，一台机就可供一百五十台机的用纱，从而结束了手工操作的历史，从根本上解决了生产“靠天吃饭”的老关键。类似这些例子是很多的。
    运动过程中，许多企业原来设备获得了全面的革新和改造，自己制造了大批的专用设备和专用工具，解决了许多生产上过去不能解决的关键问题，从而使劳动生产率迅速获得提高。如南宁五金制品厂自制了冲压铁锹的模具，提高了工效一百一十三倍；桂林市火柴厂制成了糊盒机，一个机就可代替六十人的劳动。运动过程中，不仅大幅度地提高了劳动生产率，有的在经过革新以后，还大大地节约了原材料。
    技术革新和技术革命显示出来的成效，大大地促进了生产的高速度发展。我区工业总产值1月份比去年同期增长了86.97％，比去年12月增长19.87％，而2月又比1月增长7.6％，生产上一月超过一月。按照现在的水平，我区今年工业总产值的计划任务仅是现有的企业就可完成，如加上今年新建企业投入生产部分，我区必将可以大大地超额完成今年工业生产任务。这足以证明，发挥广大职工群众的智慧和力量开展技术革新技术革命，工业生产建设必定能够高速度地发展。
    如同工矿企业中的大好形势一样，我区广大农村，在农业战线上也已掀起了蓬勃的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。不论是平原或是山区，不论是汉族地区或是少数民族地区，各族人民群众在党的领导下，革新创造之风热火朝天。在水稻田地区，春插中普遍推广了插秧机，大大节省了人力又提早了季节。地处偏僻的山区，也开展了声势浩大的以水力、畜力代替人力的全套农业工具改革运动，如靖西等县，已经基本实现了运输车子化和农副产品加工半机械化，大新县实现了加工水力动力化，正在逐步向水力电力化努力。都安瑶族自治县过去玉米都用人工加工，花费很大一批劳动力。全自治县食堂光磨玉米就安排了一万一千多个劳动力，还需一部分妇女晚上加班做，经过了技术革新，现在基本实现了水力畜力连环磨化，只要二千多头牛和一千一百多个劳动力就够用了，从而给农业生产战线增添了成万个劳动力，妇女晚上也不要背娃仔去舂米而有时间学文化了。山区农事生产上的运输，一向就是一个大问题，而在这次群众运动中，许多地区也已经获得初步的解决。例如忻城县欧洞公社是一个“五步一凸，十步一凹”的山区，他们普修了大路三百零三条，长达六百七十华里，征服了崎岖险隘，找出了一条山区走车群的道路来，当他们在推广牛拉车的时候，发现原来旧式的大轮牛车爬坡下岭走不了，他们千方百计地研究如何使之适应山区特点，现在已改制成了“上坡不费力，下坡能控制”的小轮牛车，及时全面推广，社内95％的?场都能够使用它来运肥，保证了社内今年早玉米扩种大于过去十倍的肥料需要。百色澄碧河水库上的各民族民工，经过大搞工具改革，大制各种运输工具，现在，人们再也看不到像去年10月以前用肩挑背背运土那样的情况了，工效日日提高，坝首的坝土工程由日填七千多立方米连续上升到二万、二万五千而突破到三万立方米，将使工程可以大大提早完成。
    我区技术革新和技术革命获得这样迅速的进展和成就，这是党的社会主义建设总路线和人民公社的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在实践中，进一步解放了我区各族人民群众的思想，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格得到发扬，人们的精神面貌获得了大大的改变。各民族间进一步开展了共产主义的大协作，互相参观学习，互相评比竞赛，社会主义的民族关系更加发展了。实践也充分说明，科学技术并不是高不可攀的，只要解放思想，鼓足更大干劲，技术落后的面貌是完全可以迅速改变的。人民群众是越穷越要革命、越忙越要革新的，只要我们继续加强党的领导，遵循着毛主席不断革命论的精神，把运动抓紧抓好，就能使这个蓬勃的技术革新和技术革命运动一浪更高一浪地往前发展，取得更大更全面的胜利。
