Expanding Raw Material Sources to Increase Paper Production
Representative Zhou Lindu Discusses the Production Leap Forward at Guangzhou Paper Mill

Under the leadership of the Party and illuminated by the general line, the Guangzhou Paper Mill achieved a great leap forward in 1958 and continued its great leap forward in 1959.

In 1958, it produced 65,588 tons of paper, an increase of 33.57% over 1957. In 1959, it produced 78,449 tons of paper, an increase of 19.61% over 1958. Newsprint accounted for a significant proportion of the paper produced. Other indicators such as product quality, output value, labor productivity, and profit all exceeded the state plan, and costs were lower than planned. In 1959, the output value reached 110.75 million yuan, exceeding the plan by 1.42%. The average labor productivity per person was 32,690 yuan, exceeding the plan by 1.81%, and costs were 1.4% lower than planned. The average number of registered employees at the end of 1959 was 3,379, a decrease of 288 from the end of 1958. Last year, major personal injury accidents and serious equipment accidents were eliminated, and general accidents were greatly reduced, basically achieving safe production. In addition, great achievements were also made in tapping the potential of the enterprise, creating machines, and developing comprehensive utilization: Last year, relying on our own technical strength, we designed and manufactured a complete set of equipment for producing sulfuric acid. It was put into production in July and has supplied 3,800 tons of sulfuric acid to date, with a daily production capacity of more than 30 tons. Four round-net paper machines were manufactured, one of which has a daily output of five tons and supports the Fengchuan Paper Mill. The remaining three were put into production in our factory, producing more than 1,600 tons of paper throughout the year. Large ceramic grinding stones and fine grinding stones for chain wood grinders were successfully trial-produced. Plasticizers were manufactured using waste sulfite liquor, and vanillin was successfully trial-produced.

Last year, we encountered many difficult problems in production. The more significant ones were: due to increased production, the required amount of logs also needed to be increased accordingly, but the supply of logs could not meet the needs; to achieve increased paper production, we mainly relied on tapping the capacity of existing equipment rather than relying on adding new equipment; with the development of comprehensive utilization, many equipment items were put into production, but the labor force seemed insufficient; ... and so on.

Faced with these difficulties, the Party Committee resolutely implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, taking the general line as the key link. We implemented the guiding ideology of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and high-speed progress in all our work, adhered to putting politics in command, especially after the anti-rightist rectification campaign among cadres and the general line education movement among workers, constantly criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas and sentiments of fearing difficulties and slackening efforts. All employees in the factory established great ambitions. On this basis, we launched a vigorous mass movement, seized the key issues in production during the movement, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, cadres took the lead in fighting hard, adopted the "three-in-one" form, and methods of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, as well as organizing class and team red flag competitions, technical performance competitions, one-dragon continuous competitions, and opponent competitions, etc., setting off one upsurge of technical innovation after another. Last year, employees proposed more than 1,500 technical innovation projects, of which more than 460 have been implemented, solving many large and small key and weak links in production.

For example, due to insufficient supply of logs, employees used waste wood chips, bark shavings, wood knots, raw wood pieces, and even the decayed pulp in sewage pools as papermaking raw materials. Moreover, a large amount of straw pulp was produced using rice straw, cogon grass, bagasse, and sugarcane husks, thus saving more than 20,000 cubic meters of logs, ensuring the needs of increased production. Last year's increased production mainly relied on tapping the potential of existing equipment. Employees repeatedly increased the speed of the paper machines. For example, the average speed of the two paper machines in the first paper workshop increased from about 210 meters per minute in 1958 to about 220 meters per minute, reaching a maximum of 233 meters, thus greatly increasing the daily output. The original design capacity of the two machines was 50 tons per day, but now it has reached 95 to 100 tons. The speed of the high-speed paper machine increased from 388 meters to 408 meters, reaching a maximum of 430 meters. At the same time, we vigorously tackled the "head break" bottleneck in papermaking, improving the papermaking rate and the finished paper rate. The high-speed paper machine averaged 196 minutes of "head breaks" per day in 1958, but this was reduced to 116 minutes last year, a reduction of 40%. This item alone increased production by more than 2,450 tons in one year. The high-speed paper machine is a new piece of equipment, but since it was started up at the end of 1956, the "paper guide rope" has frequently broken, requiring the machine to be stopped multiple times a day to connect the rope. Last year, employees boldly improved the paper guide rope wheel equipment, basically eliminating this accident after March. This can increase paper production by more than 170 tons per year. This fact also shows that modern machinery and equipment must also undergo technical innovation. The consumption of papermaking copper mesh also decreased, from 0.192 square meters of copper mesh per ton of paper in 1958 to 0.15 square meters in 1959, reaching the national advanced level. The entire year saved more than 2,700 square meters of copper mesh, worth more than 120,000 yuan. Due to the strengthening of equipment maintenance and repair work, the operating rate of the equipment has also greatly improved. Last year, in addition to increasing the production of pulp and paper, our factory also had to produce sulfuric acid, several paper machines, and other products. The original plan was to add more than 540 people, but due to the vigorous technical performance competitions and improved labor organization, work efficiency was greatly improved. As a result, not only were no people added, but the number of registered employees at the end of 1959 was reduced compared to the end of 1958, and 271 employees were transferred to support various brother factories, achieving increased production and increased tasks without increasing the number of people.

Since the beginning of this year, the scale of the mass movement for technical revolution in our factory has become even more magnificent and in-depth. In order to broaden the resources of papermaking raw materials and solve the problem of insufficient log supply, we mixed some bagasse pulp to manufacture newsprint. In the past, bagasse pulp was only used up to 10%, but now it is used up to 20% to 30%, and for a short period of time, it was used up to 70% to 80%. The quality of the paper, except for more dust, meets the quality indicators. This broke the past superstitious belief that bagasse pulp was not suitable for high-speed papermaking. In February, a technical revolution movement centered on "fourizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) was vigorously carried out. This movement was warmly supported by the broad masses of employees, and the movement came on strong. In just over a month, more than 150 various technical innovations were made, turning 14.7% of the originally manually operated personnel (accounting for 29.77% of the factory's workers) into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, greatly reducing the labor intensity of the workers. For example, the establishment of a mechanical transportation line for logs and mechanical debarking not only eliminated heavy physical handling, but also saved more than 90 laborers. In the movement, many major key technical problems were also overcome. For example, workers on the high-speed paper machine improved the electrical control equipment, stabilized the speed, and played a significant role in reducing paper breaks, resulting in a new record of continuous operation for nineteen hours without a break. Various paper workshops have greatly recovered fibers from white water, reducing the loss from 8% to 3%; the pulping workshop has implemented warm water recovery, saving more than 20 tons of steam per day.

The facts of technical innovation and technical revolution in the Guangzhou Paper Mill show that large enterprises can and must also vigorously carry out mass movements. Scientific and technological work can only be done well under the leadership of the Party and by relying on all employees. Only in this way can we promote the continued leap forward in production.

This year, our factory will continue to vigorously carry out mass movements and vigorously carry out technical revolutions. We must try every means to overcome various difficulties. We must achieve a greater leap forward than last year, and strive to reach 100,000 tons of paper production, an increase of 40% over 1959.

    扩大原料来源增产纸张
    周林度代表谈广州造纸厂的生产大跃进
    广州造纸厂在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年取得了大跃进的胜利，1959年实现了继续大跃进。
    1958年生产纸张六万五千五百八十八吨，比1957年增长33.57％，1959年生产纸张七万八千四百四十九吨，比1958年增长19.61％；纸张中新闻纸占了很大的比重。其他如产品质量产值，劳动生产率，利润等指标都超额完成国家计划，成本比计划下降。1959年产值达到一亿一千零七十五万元，超计划1.42％；全员劳动生产率三万二千六百九十元，超计划1.81％，成本比计划下降1.4％。1959年底平均在册人数三千三百七十九人，比1958年底减少二百八十八人。去年消减了重大人身事故及恶性的设备事故，一般事故大大减少，基本上实现安全生产。此外在发挥企业潜力，创造机器，发展综合利用等方面，也取得了很大的成绩：去年我们依靠自己的技术力量，设计及制造一整套生产硫酸的设备，7月份投入生产，至今供制硫酸三千八百吨，日产能力达到三十多吨。制造了四台圆网造纸机，其中一台日产五吨，支援了封川造纸厂。其余三台在本厂投入生产，全年产纸一千六百多吨。试制成功链式磨木机用的大型陶瓷磨石及精磨机磨石。利用亚硫酸蒸煮废液制造塑化剂及试制成功香兰素。
    去年在生产上碰到了不少困难问题，比较重大的是：由于增产，所需的原木量也相应要求增加，但原木的供应量却满足不了需要；要实现纸张增产，但主要依靠发掘原有设备的能力而不是依靠增加新设备；发展综合利用，不少设备投入生产，但劳动力显得不足；……等等。
    面对着这些困难，党委坚决的贯彻了党的八届八中全会精神，以总路线为纲。在一切工作中贯彻了多快好省、高速度前进的指导思想，坚持政治挂帅，特别是经过干部中的反右倾整风和工人群众中的总路线教育运动，不断批判右倾保守思想和畏难松劲情绪，全厂职工大树雄心壮志，在这一基础上，开展了声势浩大的群众运动，在运动中抓住了生产上的关键问题，大闹技术革新和技术革命，干部带头奋战，采取了“三结合”的形式，和自力更生、土洋并举的方法，以及组织班组红旗竞赛技术表演赛、一条龙连环赛、对手赛等等，掀起一个又一个的技术革新高潮，去年全年职工提出的技革项目达到一千五百多个，已实现的有四百六十多项，解决了许多大大小小的生产关键和薄弱环节。
    例如原木供应不足，职工们把过去废弃的木糠、刨皮、木节、生木片以及污水池里的腐浆也利用作造纸原料，而且还利用稻草，芒草，蔗渣，蔗壳等生产大量草类浆，因而节约了两万多立方原木，保证了增产的需要。去年增产主要是依靠挖掘原有设备的潜力，职工们一再提高抄纸机的车速，如第一抄纸车间两台纸机平均车速由1958年每分钟二百一十米左右，提高到二百二十米左右，最高达到二百三十三米，因而日产量大大提高，原设计能力两台机日产五十吨，现在达到九十五至一百吨，高速抄纸机由三百八十八米提高到四百零八米，最高达到四百三十米。同时猛攻抄纸的“断头”关，提高抄造率和成纸率，高速纸机1958年平均每天“断头”一百九十六分钟，去年减少到一百一十六分钟，减少达40％。仅这一项一年就增产二千四百五十多吨。高速纸机是一台新设备，但自1956年底开机以来，经常发生拉断“引纸绳”事故，每天都要停机多次接绳，去年职工们大胆改进了引纸绳轮的设备，从3月份以后就基本上消灭了这一事故。一年即可增产一百七十多吨纸张，这一件事实也说明现代化的机器设备，同样必须进行技术革新。造纸铜网的消耗也下降了，由1958年每吨纸消耗铜网零点一九二平方米，降低到1959年的零点一五平方米达到了全国先进水平，全年节约铜网二千七百多平方米，约值十二万余元。由于加强了设备的维护检修工作，设备的运转率也有了很大提高。去年我厂除了增产纸浆及纸张之外，还要生产硫酸，几种造纸机等产品，原计划要增加五百四十多人，但由于大闹技术表演赛，改进了劳动组织，大大提高工作效率，结果不仅没有增人，1959年底还比1958年底在册人数减少了，还抽调了二百七十一个职工支援各兄弟厂，实现了增产增事不增人。
    今年以来，我厂技术革命群众运动规模又更加壮阔和深入。为了广开造纸原料的资源，解决原木供应不足的问题，我们掺用部分甘蔗渣浆制造新闻纸。过去蔗渣浆只用到10％，现在用到20％到30％，有一段短时间用到70％到80％。纸的质量除尘埃较多外，是符合质量指标的。打破了过去认为蔗渣浆不适宜于高速造纸的迷信思想。由于目前还存在一系列问题，主要是原料的运输和处理，还需进一步解决，才能大量使用草类纤维。2月大搞以“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）为中心的技术革命运动，这一运动得到广大职工群众的热烈拥护，运动来势迅猛，仅一个多月各种技术革新即达一百五十多件，使原来手工操作的人数（占全厂工人29.77％），有14.7％转为机械化、半机械化操作，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。例如建立了一条原木的机械运输线及机械去皮，不仅取销了沉重的体力搬运，还节约了九十多个劳动力。在运动中还攻破了许多技术上的重大关键问题，如高速抄纸机工人改进了电气控制设备，稳定了车速，对减少抄纸断头起了很大作用，出现了连续十九小时不断头的新纪录。各个抄纸车间大量回收白水中纤维，使流失由8％下降到3％；化浆车间实行温水回收，每天节约蒸汽二十多吨。
    广州造纸厂技术革新和技术革命的事实，说明大洋企业也可以而且必须大搞群众运动，科学技术工作，只有在党的领导下，依靠全体职工，才能搞好，也只有这样才能促使生产继续跃进。
    今年，我厂还是要大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，要千方百计克服各种困难，要实现比去年更大跃进，纸张产量要力争达到十万吨，比1959年增长40％。
