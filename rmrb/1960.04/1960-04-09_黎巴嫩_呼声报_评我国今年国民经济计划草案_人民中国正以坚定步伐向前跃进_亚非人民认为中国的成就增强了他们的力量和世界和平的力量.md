Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Beirut: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Haya" published a message and article on March 31, hailing the draft national economic plan for 1960 presented to the National People's Congress of China by Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council of China.

    The newspaper stated that the figures in this plan are "amazing. These figures most eloquently illustrate the great revolution that is changing the face of China, raising it from an extremely backward state to the peaks of prosperity and construction. The figures also show that hundreds of millions of Chinese people, after experiencing thousands of years of disease, ignorance, and starvation, are racing against time to catch up with advanced industrial countries."

    The newspaper praised the speed of China's development. It said that it is not an exaggeration to say that this speed of developing production and improving people's living standards is unprecedented. "These figures clearly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The figures show what miracles the people can create when they control their own destiny and have loyal leaders from the people who have mastered the scientific theory of social development."

    The newspaper also emphasized the peaceful nature of China's economic development plan and budget. It stated that in China's 1960 budget, military expenditure accounted for about 8%, while construction expenditure accounted for 80%, "which prominently demonstrates the Chinese people's peaceful intentions, the Chinese people's dedication to developing production and improving people's living standards." The newspaper added, "This refutes the US imperialists' constant slander of 'China's aggressive intentions'."

    The newspaper attached great importance to China's economic achievements, believing that they are of particular significance to newly independent countries. It stated, "China's achievements have aroused the hostility and hatred of imperialists and reactionaries all over the world, while at the same time arousing lofty sympathy and jubilation in the hearts of the Arab people and the people of all Asian and African countries, because the people of these countries understand very well that every new strength of the Chinese people strengthens their power and the power of world peace, and creates new obstacles for imperialists, war-mongers, and enemies of the people."

    Finally, the newspaper talked about the US imperialists' hostility towards China, mocking their ignorance and stupidity. The newspaper pointed out, "People's China is leaping forward with determined steps, moving into the ranks of developed and advanced major countries... China is increasingly winning the respect and support of the people of all countries in the world."

    黎巴嫩“呼声报”评我国今年国民经济计划草案
    人民中国正以坚定步伐向前跃进
    亚非人民认为中国的成就增强了他们的力量和世界和平的力量
    新华社8日讯　贝鲁特消息，黎巴嫩
  “呼声报”3月31日刊载消息和文章，欢呼中国国务院副总理李富春向中国全国人民代表大会提出的1960年国民经济计划草案。
    报纸说，这个计划中的数字“令人惊异。这些数字最雄辩地说明了正在改变中国面貌的巨大革命，这个革命把中国从极其落后的状态提高到繁荣昌盛和建设的高峰。这些数字也表明，几亿中国人民的儿子在经历了几千年的疾病、蒙昧和饥饿状态之后，正在同时间竞赛，赶上先进的工业国”。
    报纸对中国发展的速度表示赞扬。它说，说这种发展生产和提高人民的生活水平的速度史无前例是不过份的。“这些数字明显地显示出社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。数字表明，当人民掌握了自己的命运并有来自人民、掌握了社会发展科学理论的忠诚的领导人的时候，人民能创造出怎样的奇迹”。
    报纸还强调指出中国经济发展计划和预算的和平性质。它说在1960年的中国预算中，军事开支约占8％，而建设费用占80％，“这就突出地表明中国人民的和平意愿，中国人民一心致力于发展生产和提高人民的生活水平”。报纸又说，“这就驳斥了美帝国主义者不断污蔑‘中国的侵略意图’的说法”。
    报纸极其重视中国的经济成就，认为这一成就特别对新独立的国家有重要意义。它说，“中国的成就引起世界各地的帝国主义者和反动派的仇视和憎恶，而同时在阿拉伯人民和所有亚非各国人民心中引起崇高的同情感和欢欣鼓舞，因为这些国家的人民很明白，中国人民的每一个新的力量，就是增强他们的力量和世界和平的力量，并为帝国主义者、战争贩子和人民的敌人树立新的障碍”。
    报纸最后谈到美帝国主义者敌视中国时，嘲笑他们的愚蠢无知。报纸指出，“人民中国正在以坚定的步伐向前跃进，步入发达的和先进的主要国家的行列中。……中国越来越赢得世界各国人民的尊敬和支持”。
