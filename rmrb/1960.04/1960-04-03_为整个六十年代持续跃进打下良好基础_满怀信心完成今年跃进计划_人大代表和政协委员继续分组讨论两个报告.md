Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: National People's Congress deputies today continued group discussions of the reports made to the Congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council. The deputies generally believed that this year's plan for developing the national economy is a continuing leap forward plan that can definitely be realized. Completing this plan will lay a solid foundation for a continuous leap forward throughout the entire sixties.

Many deputies from all walks of life and regions expressed full confidence in exceeding this year's plan. Han Xinliang, a famous steelworker representative from Shanghai, said that the state's plan to produce 18.4 million tons of steel this year is the glorious and great task of our steelworkers. Under the leadership of the Party, we are vigorously carrying out technological innovation and revolution, promoting advanced experiences, and tapping production potential. It is safe to say that this year's steel production targets will definitely be fulfilled and overfulfilled. Pingshun County in Shanxi Province, with its high mountains and thin soil, has already achieved the average grain yield target of 400 jin per mu stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. Li Shunda, a deputy from this county, said that this year they will rearrange the rivers and mountains and strive to reach a yield of 500 jin per mu, determined to turn "Taihang into Jiangnan" as soon as possible. Representatives from Tibet, a remote region, also expressed confidence in making a leap forward in production this year. They said that not only will agricultural and animal husbandry production in Tibet be greatly developed, but they will also begin to build their own steel plants, allowing molten iron to flow in the last region of the motherland without steel production.

Deputies mentioned in the discussion that in order to achieve a leap forward that is both high-speed and proportional, it is necessary to make overall arrangements, work together as one, and strengthen collaboration. At the meeting, the issue of all sectors vigorously supporting agriculture aroused great attention from the deputies. Many representatives from industry, transportation, commerce, schools, science, and the arts proposed to do their best to vigorously support agriculture. Xie Weijie, a representative from Henan Province and chief engineer of the Technology Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, said that vigorously supporting agriculture is an important task of the chemical industry sector. This year, the output of chemical fertilizers, sulfuric acid, rubber, and other products in our country will increase significantly. Among them, fertilizer production will more than double compared to 1959, and sulfuric acid will increase by 42%. Hundreds of small synthetic ammonia plants across the country are producing large quantities of nitrogen fertilizer. The experience of using small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces to produce calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer is also being promoted in many places. Continuing to implement the "walking on two legs" policy in the chemical industry sector will ensure that we can definitely fulfill and overfulfill this year's chemical industry production plan. Senior Colonel Liu Shanben, a representative from the military, said that last year the air force sent planes to spray insecticide powder, saving 120,000 mu of crops affected by locust plagues; they also dispatched planes to spray powder to eliminate wheat stripe rust. In addition, they trained nearly 5,000 technicians for people's communes and factories.

Representatives from various regions also excitedly talked about how, with the advent of the high tide of the technological innovation and revolution movement, a new high tide in the construction of socialist culture has begun from the interior to the border regions. Anniwar Hanbaba, a representative from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said: Xinjiang's cultural and educational undertakings are developing at an astonishing rate. There are now 429 primary schools, 250 middle schools, and 9 institutions of higher learning, all of which have increased by more than 80% compared to 1957. There are also 323 agricultural middle schools and a large number of literacy classes. The entire autonomous region has more than 2 million people studying culture in various schools or literacy classes. Xie Bingxin, a representative and writer from Fujian Province, described the moving scene she saw when she inspected Hubei, Hebei, and other places, where mass cultural and artistic groups grew rapidly during the Great Leap Forward in production. She said, just as a farmer-poet said: "The more mountain songs are sung, the greater the energy; the greater the energy, the more poems." Jin Shilong, the director of the Dongsheng People's Commune in Yanji County, Jilin Province, said that at present, their commune has established 9 full-time primary schools, 3 half-day and full-time junior middle schools, 1 senior middle school, 81 amateur junior middle school classes, 15 senior middle school classes, as well as 1 amateur university and 8 types of amateur technical schools. 91.2% of the young and middle-aged people in the entire commune have enrolled in school, creating a moving scene of "everyone is busy with production, and there is the sound of reading everywhere." Du Mengmo, a representative from Henan Province, and Ouyang Yuqian, a representative from Shanghai, used specific examples in their speeches to illustrate that the policy of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor is completely correct.

The deputies mentioned that in order to meet the needs of the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to vigorously develop scientific research and actively cultivate scientific research personnel. Farmer scientist Wang Baojing proposed to dare to think and dare to do, and break down superstitions. He said that in 1958, we vigorously conducted satellite field experiments, increasing wheat yields from more than 100 jin per mu in the past to 1,000 jin. Later, we adopted cotton-grain intercropping and other new planting methods, increasing wheat yields to 3,000 jin per mu. Cotton has also greatly increased.

Many representatives who personally participated in or visited urban people's communes and urban street industries warmly hailed the growth of this new thing. Wang Zhongyi, the first secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, said that urban people's communes can not only promote the high-speed development of urban economic and cultural construction, but also are the best form for organizing people's lives. The Harbin City People's Commune, with the development of production as the center, has comprehensively arranged various aspects of work, and has brought about tremendous changes in the city's production and life. After the establishment of the people's commune, state-owned industries, large-scale industries, small factories, and street factories have further strengthened cooperation, and production has increased significantly. Many streets have established various types of factories. A large number of women have participated in production, their actual income has increased, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have been effectively improved. "Chairman Mao built a happy stage, the working people came up, the mountains are there, the water is there, the stones are there, poverty will never come again," this is the praise of the urban people's commune written by the staff and residents of Harbin City from their own experience.

Tang Guifen, who recently visited urban people's communes in Shijiazhuang City, introduced the people's commune she visited, which was called the "Communist Happy Courtyard" by the masses, to the Shanghai delegation. This courtyard has more than 370 households, which were originally divided into small courtyards. Now people are organized into 17 groups to carry out various productions, and the small courtyards have also been opened up. Tang Guifen said that with the urban people's commune, people's thinking has greatly changed. The small courtyards of the past have now become a socialist big family. Shi Liang, vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said that running urban people's communes on a large scale is the urgent desire of the broad masses of women. The reports of the two vice premiers have given strong support to this desire of the broad masses of women.

Representatives from various ethnic minority areas are proud of the rapid development of their respective ethnic groups. They said: Our country was poor and blank, and the ethnic minority areas were even poorer and blanker. With the help of the Party and advanced ethnic groups, the construction of the ethnic minority areas is developing at a higher average speed than the national average, and will continue to leap forward in the future. Representatives of the Yi, Miao, Dai, and other ethnic groups in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces said: In the past, we planted a slope and harvested a pot, often living on wild vegetables and wild fruits. Now, livestock are thriving and grains are abundant. Every people's commune has established factories, and even in some remote mountain valleys, there are steel plants and small power stations and milk farms. It's truly a world-shaking change. Zha Xi Wang Xu, Guan Baojia, and Xia Rong Gabu, representatives from Qinghai Province, said: The vast Tibetan areas of Qinghai are now: economically prosperous and financially abundant. Representatives of all ethnic groups also used eloquent facts to illustrate that the people's commune is the best form for developing the economy and culture of all ethnic groups and enhancing national unity. Hu Heletai, a model worker in animal husbandry from Inner Mongolia, said excitedly: Last year, the grassland suffered a major disaster that had not occurred in 70 or 80 years. Under the leadership of the Party, our commune overcame the wind and snow and won a bumper harvest. Every herdsman said that the people's commune is good!

The representatives from Tibet unanimously supported the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. They excitedly talked about the tremendous achievements made in various aspects of the Tibet region in the past year, pointing out that this is a great victory for the Party's ethnic policy.

Apei Awang Jinmei said that like the situation in other parts of the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Tibet's work in 1959 also achieved a great leap forward. The suppression of the rebellion and democratic reforms have achieved great victories. As of the beginning of March this year, democratic reforms have been completed in 49 counties, covering more than 600,000 people. The emancipated farmers and herdsmen have become the masters of the land and the masters of society, and their enthusiasm for production has been greatly brought into play. Apei Awang Jinmei also praised the fine style of hard work and simplicity of the Han cadres and Tibetan people who eat, live, and work together, saying that this has greatly strengthened the unity between ethnic groups in the Tibet region.

In the group discussions today and yesterday, representatives from Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Fujian, the People's Liberation Army, and many other groups discussed Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 final accounts and the 1960 draft budget. The deputies believed that this is a peaceful budget and a budget that supports the comprehensive leap forward of socialist construction. Hou Debang, a representative from Jiangsu Province, said that in the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the proportion of economic and cultural construction expenditures in our country's budget has increased year by year, while defense and administrative expenses have gradually decreased. This year, the percentage of our country's defense and administrative expenses in the total budget expenditure has decreased from an average of 30.9% during the First Five-Year Plan to 12.8%, of which defense expenses account for only 8.3%. In 1960 to 1961, the United States' military expenditure accounted for 57.1% of the budget expenditure, Britain accounted for 33%, France's military expenditure in 1960 accounted for about one-quarter, and West Germany accounted for 24%. These huge military expenditures powerfully exposed the true face of American imperialism as a fake peace and real war preparation. Some representatives of the People's Liberation Army said that this year, our country's economic and cultural construction expenditure accounts for 81.9% of the entire budget expenditure, and defense expenditure only accounts for 8.3%. This fully demonstrates the ardent desire of the Chinese people to engage in peaceful construction, and also powerfully refutes the imperialists' shameless slander against our country. We fully support the decision of the Party and the state, and we must strive to strengthen national defense construction on the basis of strengthening economic construction.

During the two days of group discussions, the State Council sent a large number of responsible cadres to participate in the group meetings. They answered various questions raised by the deputies regarding the two reports.

Sunday, the 3rd, the meeting will be adjourned for one day, and will continue on the 4th.

Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: The Second Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC continued today with group discussions of the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian.

Many members mentioned in their speeches the necessity and benefits of running urban people's communes on a large scale, running street industries on a large scale, running suburban agriculture on a large scale, running public welfare undertakings on a large scale, and running public canteens on a large scale. Xiao Huaqing, deputy director of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that urban people's communes not only organize production, but also organize people's lives. After Chongqing City established people's communes, many moving things happened. He praised the service stations as all-purpose service stations, taking care of the residents' living needs very thoughtfully. Some members saw during their inspections that after the city ran welfare undertakings on a large scale, it liberated working women from household burdens and enabled them to give full play to their wisdom. Shen Fangcheng, a member, said that some ordinary housewives in Shanghai participated in industrial production and quickly mastered complex production techniques such as assembling telephones.

The members from the agricultural front were very moved by the state's emphasis on developing agriculture and the support from all aspects for agriculture. They expressed their determination to do their best to complete the task of developing agricultural production, so that the development of the entire national economy can be built on a solid foundation. They said that the state has consistently implemented the policy of increasing agricultural production without increasing taxes for several years, especially in the past two years, agricultural production has continuously made great leaps forward, but agricultural taxes have remained stable at the 1958 level. This year, agricultural taxes account for only 3.3 billion yuan of the state's budget revenue, while direct investment in agriculture in the expenditure reaches 7.89 billion yuan. The state's indirect investment and local self-owned agricultural funds are not included, and there are also a large number of agricultural loans. Wang Yukun, director of the Nanwangzhuang People's Commune in Hebei Province, said that industry vigorously supports agriculture, and our farmers must also vigorously support industry. Workers and peasants are close brothers and must leap forward shoulder to shoulder. Gao Fengzhi, a commune cadre from Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, compared the labor conditions of farmers before and after the realization of semi-mechanization in his hometown. He said that in the past, using heavy old farm tools resulted in low labor efficiency, rough cultivation, and very hard labor. Now, using animal-powered farm machinery greatly reduces labor intensity, improves efficiency, and improves quality. He said that this is all the happiness brought to farmers by industrial support for agriculture. Zou Bingwen, a specially invited person and consultant to the Ministry of Agriculture, based on the superiority of the people's commune, proposed increasing the production of sugar raw materials and accelerating the development of the sugar industry.

The large number of new creations in technological innovation and revolution have also changed the face of railway transportation. Li Yong, the former locomotive chief of the Mao Zedong locomotive and now the vice chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, said: "We have full confidence in ensuring the completion of the major task of developing railway construction proposed by the state this year." He used a large number of new creations he knew about from railway workers in the Northwest, Northeast, Central South, and other regions in the technological innovation and revolution movement to illustrate that industrial and agricultural production can continue to leap forward, and railway transportation can also continue to leap forward.

Members of the medical and health circles talked about in their discussions that under the leadership of the Party, a new situation of changing customs, eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and improving physical health has emerged across the country. Cao Yixiu, a famous Dai ethnic group rat-catching expert, introduced new developments in her rat-catching experience at the group meeting. Now, she can not only find rat holes according to the habits of rats and determine whether there are rats according to the shape of the holes, but also created a method for finding hidden holes. Therefore, her rat-catching effect is getting bigger and bigger.

In the group discussions of various democratic parties, Liu Tong, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Chen Suiheng, a member of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Tang Zhe, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Chen Qiyou, chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, and others believed that now our country is in a state of "infinitely good situation, the country is a sea of red." The development of national construction is very fast, and individuals' subjective world must keep up with the development of the objective situation. We must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, accelerate ideological transformation, and contribute more to socialism.

People from the literary and art circles, scientific circles, and educational circles also talked about the importance of conducting ideological transformation in their speeches. They said that ideological revolution is the great prerequisite for completing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. They expressed that they would work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and also learn the noble communist style of workers and peasants who "give way to honor, go forward in the face of difficulties, learn from the advanced, and help the backward," and overcome bourgeois individualism. They cited a large number of advanced deeds of workers and peasants and their impact on their own thinking and work. Quyi performer Hou Baolin said that Quyi performances have always been solo performances, and actors of different types of Quyi cannot perform on the same stage. However, recently they were influenced by the communist spirit of "for sixty-one class brothers" and unprecedentedly created a "Quyi Grand Medley" that combines a variety of different Quyi styles, which is very popular with the audience. He said that if it were not for vigorously promoting the communist spirit of large-scale collaboration, there would be no such new creation. He proposed that the literary and art circles should widely carry out creative and performance large-scale collaborations. Lu Xiu, deputy director of the Chengdu Women's Federation, said that we must learn from the spirit of workers and peasants to liberate our minds, dare to think and dare to do, and be brave in creation. Guan Ruiwu, a professor at Beijing Normal University, saw the scene of the broad masses of workers and peasants, from children to the elderly, joining the tide of technological innovation and revolution during his inspection in Henan Province. He recited a poem written by a worker that he copied down during the inspection: The worldview is the "Red Flag Brand," eliminating the "Me Only Brand"; the thinking is the "Liberation Brand," eliminating the "Conservative Brand"; the drive is the "Permanent Brand," eliminating the "Discouraged Brand"; the ambition is the "Firm Brand," eliminating the "Wavering Brand." She said that this is a good standard for the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

Today, members of various ethnic minorities mentioned in their speeches that the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has become closer during the Great Leap Forward. Mu Zhifang, a 72-year-old Hui ethnic member, described the close brotherly relationship between the Hui and Han people in Tianjin City with many moving examples.

At the China Zhi Gong Party and Overseas Chinese group meeting, members excitedly said that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the motherland is leaping forward, prosperous and strong, and overseas Chinese are greatly encouraged. Lu Xinyuan, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that our government sent ships to pick up overseas Chinese persecuted in Indonesia, allowing them to return to the warm embrace of the motherland and participate in the construction of the motherland, making all overseas Chinese feel extremely proud of the motherland's strength and prosperity today.

Tomorrow, the 3rd, is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day, and will continue on the 4th.

    为整个六十年代持续跃进打下良好基础
    满怀信心完成今年跃进计划
    人大代表和政协委员继续分组讨论两个报告
    据新华社2日讯　全国人民代表大会代表今天继续分组讨论李富春和李先念两位副总理代表国务院向大会所作的报告。代表们普遍认为，今年发展国民经济的计划是一个肯定能够实现的继续跃进的计划，完成了这个计划，将为整个六十年代的连续跃进打下一个良好的基础。
    来自各行各业各个地区的许多代表，都表示了超额完成今年计划的充分信心。上海市著名炼钢工人韩忻亮代表说，国家今年计划生产一千八百四十万吨钢，是我们钢铁工人光荣伟大的任务。在党的领导下，我们正在大闹技术革新和技术革命，推广先进经验，挖掘生产潜力。可以肯定地说，今年的钢铁生产指标一定能够完成和超额完成。山高土薄的山西省平顺县，已经提前八年实现了农业发展纲要规定的平均亩产四百斤粮食指标。来自这个县的代表李顺达说，今年他们还要重新安排河山，争取亩产量达到五百斤，决心尽快把“太行变江南”。来自边远地区的西藏代表，也表示有信心今年在生产上跃进，他们说，西藏不仅农牧业生产要大发展，而且要开始建设自己的钢铁厂，让祖国最后一个没有钢铁生产的地区铁水奔流。
    代表们在讨论中提到，为了实现既是高速度又按比例地跃进，必须全面安排，大家拧成一股绳，加强协作。在会议上，各方面大力支援农业的问题引起了代表们极大的重视。许多来自工业、运输、商业、学校、科学、艺术界的代表，都提出要各尽所能，大力支援农业。河南省代表、化学工业部技术司总工程师谢为杰说，大力支援农业是化学工业部门的一项重要任务，今年我国化学肥料、硫酸、橡胶等产品的产量都将有很大增长。其中化肥产量将比1959年增加一倍多，硫酸增加42％。各地的几百座小型合成氨厂，正在大量生产氮肥；利用小高炉和土高炉生产钙镁磷肥的经验，也正在许多地方推广。在化学工业部门继续贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，将保证我们一定能够完成和超额完成今年化学工业的生产计划。军队代表刘善本大校说，空军部队去年派出飞机撒杀虫药粉，抢救了十二万多亩受蝗灾的农作物；出动飞机撒药粉，扑灭了小麦条锈病。此外，还为人民公社和工厂培养了将近五千名技术人员。
    各地代表在讨论中还兴奋地谈到，伴随着技术革新和技术革命运动高潮的到来，从内地到边疆已经开始掀起了建设社会主义文化的新高潮。新疆维吾尔自治区代表安尼瓦尔·汉巴巴说：新疆文教事业正以惊人的速度向前发展，现在已办起了小学四百二十九所、中学二百五十所、高等学校九所，都比1957年增长了80％以上，还有三百二十三所农业中学及大批扫盲识字班，全自治区共有二百多万人在各类学校或扫盲班学习文化。福建省代表、作家谢冰心叙述了她在湖北、河北等地视察时看到的群众文艺队伍在生产大跃进中迅速成长的动人景象。她说，正像一个农民诗人所说的：“山歌越唱劲越大，干劲越大诗越多。”吉林省延吉县东盛人民公社社长金时龙说，目前，他们的公社已经办了全日制小学九所，半日制和全日制初中三所，高中一所，业余初中八十一个班，高中十五个班，还有业余大学一所和八种业余技术学校。全公社有91.2％的青壮年入了学，出现了“人人忙生产，处处读书声”的动人景象。河南省代表杜孟模、上海市代表欧阳予倩，在发言中以具体事例说明了教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与劳动生产相结合的方针是完全正确的。
    代表们谈到，适应工农业生产飞跃发展的需要，必须大力发展科学研究事业，积极培养科学研究人员。农民科学家王保京提出要敢想敢干，破除迷信。他说，1958年我们大搞卫星田试验，使小麦由过去的亩产一百多斤，提高到一千斤。后来我们又采取棉粮间作及其他新的种植方法，使小麦单作亩产提高到三千斤。棉花也有很大增长。
    许多亲身参加试办或参观过城市人民公社、城市街道工业的代表，热烈欢呼这一新生事物的成长。中共哈尔滨市委第一书记王仲夷代表说，城市人民公社不仅可以促进城市经济、文化建设的高速度发展，而且也是组织人民生活的最好形式。哈尔滨市的人民公社以发展生产为中心，全面安排了各方面的工作，已使城市生产和生活面貌发生了巨大变化。办起人民公社后，国营工业、大工业同小工厂、街道工厂进一步加强了协作，生产都有了大幅度增长。许多街道都办起了各种类型的工厂。大批妇女参加了生产，实际收入增加了，有效地提高了人民群众的物质文化生活水平。“毛主席搭了幸福台，劳动人民走上来，山在水在石头在，穷苦一去不再来”，这就是哈尔滨市职工、居民从自己的体会中写下的对城市人民公社的赞歌。
    最近在石家庄市参观过城市人民公社的汤桂芬代表，在上海代表组介绍了她参观的被群众称为“共产主义幸福大院”的人民公社。这个大院有三百七十多户人家，原来是一个个分割的小院子，现在人们组织成十七个小组进行各种生产，小院子也打通了。汤桂芬说，城市有了人民公社，人们的思想大变了，过去的小院子现在变成了一个社会主义大家庭。全国妇女联合会副主席史良代表说，大办城市人民公社，是广大妇女的迫切愿望。两位副总理的报告中，对于广大妇女的这种愿望给予了有力的支持。
    来自各少数民族地区的代表，都为本民族突飞猛进的发展而感到自豪。他们说：我国一穷二白，少数民族地区更穷更白，在党和先进民族的帮助下，少数民族地区的各项建设，正在以高于全国的平均速度向前发展，今后还将继续跃进。贵州、云南省的彝、苗、傣等族代表说：从前我们种一坡收一锅，常常靠野菜、野果过活，现在是六畜兴旺、五谷丰登。每个人民公社都办了工厂，在有些偏僻的山沟沟里也有了钢铁厂和小型发电站、牛奶场，真是翻天复地的大变化。青海省代表札喜旺徐、官保加、夏茸尕布都说：青海广大藏族地区现在是：经济兴隆、财源茂盛。各民族代表还用雄辩的事实，说明人民公社是发展各民族经济、文化和增强民族团结的最好形式。内蒙古牧业劳模胡和勒泰激动地说：去年草原上发生了七八十年未有的大灾害，我们公社在党的领导下战胜了风雪，争得丰收，牧民个个都说人民公社好！
    来自西藏的代表们一致拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理所作的报告，他们兴奋地谈到西藏地区一年来各方面的巨大成就，指出这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，和全国其他地区的形势一样，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，1959年西藏的各项工作也是大跃进。平息叛乱和民主改革都获得了很大的胜利。到今年3月初为止，已经在四十九个县、共六十多万人口的地区，完成了民主改革。翻身后的广大农牧民当了土地的主人和社会的主人，生产积极性大大地发挥出来了。阿沛·阿旺晋美还赞扬汉族干部和藏族人民同吃、同住、同劳动的艰苦朴素的优良作风，他说，这大大加强了西藏地区民族之间的团结。
    今天和昨天的小组讨论中，河南、江苏、江西、上海、福建、解放军等许多小组的代表，讨论了李先念副总理关于1959年决算和1960年预算草案的报告。代表们认为这是一个和平的预算，是一个支持社会主义建设事业全面跃进的预算。江苏省代表侯德榜说，几年来，特别是大跃进以来，我国预算支出中，经济文化建设费的比重逐年增长，国防费和行政费逐渐下降，今年我国的国防费和行政费占预算支出总数的百分比，已由第一个五年计划的平均30.9％下降到12.8％，其中国防费只占8.3％，而1960年到1961年度，美国的军费占预算支出的57.1％，英国占33％，法国在1960年军费约占四分之一，西德占24％，这些庞大的军费支出，有力地揭穿了美帝国主义假和平、真备战的本来面目。解放军有的代表说，今年我国经济文化建设费占整个预算支出的81.9％，国防费只占8.3％，它充分说明了我国人民从事和平建设的热烈愿望，也有力地驳斥了帝国主义对我国的无耻污蔑。我们完全拥护党和国家的决定，一定要在加强经济建设的基础上，努力加强国防建设。
    在两天的分组讨论中，国务院派出大批负责干部参加了小组会。他们回答了代表们对两个报告提出的各种问题。
    3日星期天，会议休会一日，4日继续举行。
    据新华社2日讯　政协第三届全国委员会第二次会议在今天继续进行分组讨论李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。
    许多委员发言中谈到了大办城市人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂的必要性和好处。民盟四川省委会副主任委员萧华清说，城市人民公社不仅把生产组织起来了，而且把人民的生活也组织起来了，重庆市办起人民公社以后，出现了许多动人的事情。他称赞服务站是万能服务站，对居民的生活需要照顾得非常周到。有些委员在视察时看到，城市大办福利事业以后，把劳动妇女从家务束缚中解放出来，使她们的智慧得到了发挥。委员沈方成说，上海市有些普通的家庭妇女参加工业生产，很快就掌握了装配电话等复杂的生产技术。
    来自农业战线上的委员们，对国家重视发展农业，各个方面对农业的支援，非常感动，他们表示一定要全力完成发展农业生产的任务，使整个国民经济的发展建筑在坚如磐石的基础上。他们说几年来国家一直实行着农业增产不增税的政策，特别是最近两年来农业生产连续大跃进，农业税却稳定在1958年的水平上。今年，国家预算收入中农业税只有三十三亿元，而在支出中对农业的直接投资却达七十八亿九千万元，国家的间接投资和地方自有农业资金还不在内，另外，还有大量农业贷款。河北省南王庄人民公社主任王玉坤说，工业大力支援农业，我们农民也要大力支援工业，工农是亲兄弟，要肩并肩地跃进。黑龙江省绥化县公社干部高凤志，把他的家乡实现半机械化前后农民的劳动情形做了对比，他说，从前使用笨重的旧农具劳动效率低，耕作粗糙，劳动非常艰苦，如今使用畜力农机具，大大减轻了劳动强度，效率高，质量好。他说这都是工业支援农业，给农民带来的幸福。特邀人士、农业部顾问邹秉文在发言中，根据人民公社的优越性，提出了增加糖的原料生产和加速发展制糖工业的建议。
    技术革新和技术革命的大量新创造，使铁路运输的面貌也发生新的变化。以前是毛泽东号机车车长、现任中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席的李永说：“国家提出的今年发展铁路建设的重大任务，我们有充分信心保证完成。”他用他所知道的西北、东北、中南等各地铁路职工，在技术革新和技术革命运动中的大量新创造，说明工农业生产能够持续跃进，铁路运输也能够持续跃进。
    委员中的医药卫生界人士在讨论中谈到，在党的领导下，目前全国已经出现了一个移风易俗、除四害、讲卫生、增进身体健康的新形势。著名的傣族捕鼠专家曹依秀，在小组会上介绍了她的捕鼠经验的新发展。现在，她不仅能够根据老鼠的习性寻找鼠洞，根据洞形确定有没有老鼠，并且又创造了找暗洞的办法。因此，她的捕鼠效果越来越大。
    各民主党派小组讨论中，民革中央委员刘通、民建中央委员陈邃衡、民盟中央委员唐哲、致公党中央主席陈其尤等认为，现在我国是“形势无限好，江山一片红”，国家建设事业发展很快，个人的主观世界要跟上客观形势的发展，必须努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，加速思想改造，才能为社会主义贡献更多的力量。
    文艺界、科学界、教育界的人士在发言中，也都谈到进行思想改造的重要性。他们说，思想革命是完成技术革命和文化革命的大前提。他们表示要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，还要学习工农劳动人民那种“见荣誉就让，见困难就上，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的崇高共产主义风格，克服资产阶级个人主义。他们列举了工农劳动群众的大量先进事迹，以及对自己的思想和工作的影响。曲艺工作者侯宝林说，曲艺表演一向是单干的，不同种类的曲艺演员不能同台演出，但是，最近他们受到了“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的共产主义精神的熏陶，破天荒地创造了多种不同曲艺体裁结合在一起的“曲艺大连唱”，很受观众欢迎。他说，如果不是大兴共产主义大协作之风，是不会有这个新创造的，他提议文艺界要广泛开展创作、演出大协作。成都市妇联副主任陆秀说，要学习工人农民解放思想，敢想敢作，勇于创造的精神。北京师范大学教授关瑞梧在河南省视察中，看到广大工农群众从小孩到老人投入技术革新和技术革命的热潮的情景时，朗诵了在视察中抄下来的一首工人写的诗：世界观是“红旗牌”，肃清“唯我牌”；思想是“解放牌”，肃清“保守牌”；干劲是“永久牌”，肃清“泄气牌”；雄心是“坚定牌”，肃清“动摇牌”。她说，这是知识分子思想改造的好标准。
    今天，各少数民族委员在发言中，谈到大跃进中我国各族人民的大团结更加紧密了。七十二岁的回族委员穆芝房用许多动人的事例，描述了天津市回汉人民亲密团结的兄弟关系。
    在致公党、华侨小组会上，委员们兴奋地说，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，祖国飞跃前进，繁荣富强，华侨受到巨大鼓舞。全国归国华侨联合会副秘书长卢心远说，我国政府派船接回在印度尼西亚受迫害的华侨，让他们回到祖国温暖的怀抱，参加祖国建设，使所有的海外华侨都为祖国今天的强大兴盛而感到无比自豪。
    明天3日是星期日，会议休会一天，4日继续举行。
