The female militia on Jingyang Ridge

Jingyang Ridge, the place where Wu Song fought the tiger in legend, has been praised by people throughout the ages. But what is even more worthy of praise is what is happening today. Since Chairman Mao put forward the great call for vigorously developing militia divisions, not only have dozens of living Wu Songs appeared here, but also one hundred and eight heroines. Under the leadership and education of the Party, these one hundred and eight girls formed the "Iron Sisters Company," each mastering both martial arts and literary talent. They are particularly active on the production front, becoming the main force of the Jingyang Ridge militia battalion, holding high the banner of high yields for several consecutive years, winning 983 certificates of merit, and being awarded the title of "March 8th Red Banner Holder" advanced unit by the All-China Women's Federation.

Iron Five Sisters

The "Iron Sisters Company" was born in the spring of 1959. Their glorious deeds must start with five girls.

Jingyang Ridge was originally a very poor place. The surrounding land was either saline-alkali or dead silt. People worked hard for a year, sometimes not even recovering their seeds. After the cooperativization in the winter of 1957, the Party put forward the call to vigorously carry out "deep plowing of the land," setting off a mass upsurge in transforming saline-alkali land. Five sixteen- and seventeen-year-old girls on Jingyang Ridge, Gao Qinglian, Gao Qingzhi, Wang Junying, Wang Xiuqin, and Yang Yuping, joined together for the first time, resolutely responding to the Party's call and embarking on the battle to transform nature. After seventy days and nights of struggle, they plowed one hundred and five mu of frozen fields. From then on, everyone on Jingyang Ridge knew about the "Iron Five Sisters."

Winter passed and spring came, and the "Iron Five Sisters" started a fifteen-mu high-yield field on the newly plowed land. The targets were: 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes and 1,000 catties of grain. No one on Jingyang Ridge had ever seen such high yields. Some conservative people gossiped: "Immortals can harvest 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes and 1,000 catties of grain, but we don't see any immortal aura in you five young girls." However, the Party supported these strong girls and invited Gao Qinglian's grandfather to be their technical advisor. In the autumn, the corn really grew like clubs, and leaders such as the first secretary of the county party committee came to inspect. As a result, the corn yield was 1,123 catties per mu, and the sweet potato yield was 12,400 catties per mu.

Production Shock Brigade

In the autumn of 1958, the People's Commune was established. Chairman Mao issued the great call for "vigorously developing militia divisions," bringing even greater vitality to the people of Jingyang Ridge. This morning, people put on new clothes. Gao Qinglian, Wang Yueying, and others, holding high the flags of the "Iron Five Sisters," "East Wind Girls Team," "Rocket Girls Team," and "Wu Song Team," gathered on Jingyang Ridge, surrounded by crowds. People happily sang: "A burst of firecrackers rings out, the People's Commune arrives at Jingyang, the crops are fertile, the ridge rejoices, people change their thinking, and the land changes its appearance." At the meeting, based on the "Iron Five Sisters," the "East Wind Girls Team" and the "Rocket Girls Team" were merged into an "Iron Sisters Platoon," with Gao Qinglian as the platoon leader and Wang Yueying and Liu Dongyue as deputy platoon leaders. The organization expanded, and the power also increased. They resolutely listened to the Party and dared to think and dare to act. They widely adopted advanced farming methods on the forty-five mu of high-yield wheat fields, and for the first time ever, they achieved a great harvest of an average wheat yield of 828 catties per mu on a saline-alkali land.

At this time, Gao Qinglian took the "Iron Five Sisters Song," created by the girls, to participate in the provincial Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe for performances in Beijing and Wuhan. She met Chairman Mao in Wuhan. Chairman Mao shook her hand cordially and said, "Good, Jingyang Ridge used to be the place where Wu Song fought the tiger, and now many new heroes have emerged!" Chairman Mao encouraged her to continue her efforts and, together with her fellow villagers, to completely change the face of Jingyang Ridge. Gao Qinglian wrote a letter to her fellow villagers, telling them about Chairman Mao's hopes for the people of Jingyang Ridge. The entire village felt as if they had seen Chairman Mao himself. They wrote thirteen bright red characters on the walls: "Build Jingyang Ridge with the spirit of Wu Song fighting the tiger," setting off an even greater production upsurge.

In the spring of 1959, the "Iron Sisters Platoon" was further expanded. They merged with the "Liu Hulan Platoon" led by Yuan Fengmei, totaling one hundred and eight generals, and established the "Iron Sisters Company." Gao Qinglian was the instructor, and Wang Junying and Li Fuqin were the company commanders. The high-yield field was expanded from forty-five mu to a hundred-mu high-yield square. This hundred mu of land was leveled like a mirror, the ridges were as straight as lines, and the soil was as fine as flour. However, when the stout seedlings grew to three or four inches, an unprecedented drought struck.

Let alone a drought, even if fire fell from the sky, it would not be able to stop these iron girls' determination for high yields. Gao Qinglian led this militia company to launch the famous "Hundred Days of Drought Resistance" battle. At that time, the weather was dry and the water was shallow, and the wells dried up in a few days and nights. At this moment, the superior Party committee issued instructions to organize eight communes, with 30,000 people, to open a hundred-li-long canal to divert the Yellow River for irrigation. The Jingyang Ridge Militia Battalion sent its strongest main force – the "Iron Sisters Company" and the "Wu Song Platoon." At the beginning of the expedition, Guo Zhongyu, the secretary of the brigade's Party branch, personally took command and set up a competition arena. The male and female soldiers lined up on both sides, each with a hundred times their spirits. Gao Qinglian took the lead in proposing: "Complete five days of tasks in three days, report victory for the first time, and vow to win the top prize!" A hero flashed out on the other side, his name was Gao Xinfu, a well-known "living Wu Song" in Jingyang Ridge, known for his well-drilling skills. The Wu Song Team he led had won hundreds of red flags. Seeing others take the lead, he said: "Good! In the past, our family set up the arena, and others came to challenge. Today, you put forward the conditions, and we will compete!" Everyone set up their positions, with men and women competing side by side, equally matched, and difficult to distinguish. On the morning of the third day, Gao Qinglian led one hundred and eight generals, holding a plaque with the words "Work hard and cleverly, complete five days of tasks in three days," and arrived at Secretary Guo's side at the same time as the "Wu Song Platoon." The Party branch awarded two banners to these two spearheads on the production front.

After a hundred days of hard work, the drought demon finally surrendered in front of these heroines. The hundred-mu high-yield square achieved a great harvest of an average yield of 1,320 catties per mu.

Red and Expert Girls of the New Era

Leaping towards greater achievements, the "Iron Sisters Company," together with the "Wu Song Platoon," started a thousand-mu high-yield wheat square last autumn. On the day of the swearing-in ceremony, Gao Qinglian, the deputy director of the commune and the one who led the Iron Five Sisters in plowing the land on that day, proposed the target at the meeting on behalf of the Iron Sisters and Wu Song members: "Thousand catties of wheat per mu!" She said: "In the past, there was only one Wu Song, but today there are countless Wu Songs. One hundred and eight generals in Jingyang Ridge are better than Mulan and Wu Song. Fight for two hundred and forty days to ensure that the wheat exceeds a thousand catties." The commune members were encouraged by the girls' passionate words and unanimously agreed to launch a linked competition according to this target. Relying on the shock role of the militia, they planted all the thousand mu of wheat in thirteen days, including land preparation, eight days earlier than other high-yield squares. At present, this patch of lush wheat seedlings has grown to knee-high, and has erected the red flag of the first-class seedlings in the entire commune! People wrote poems in praise: "The spring breeze is warm and caresses the green carpet, the Iron Sisters are like immortals, skillfully embroidering day and night, and the thousand mu of wheat fields are like brocade."

The girls want to transform themselves into cultured new-type farmers. Under the leadership of the Party organization, amateur cultural schools and amateur agricultural technical schools were set up in the fields. The majority of farm girls, who originally could not read a single word, have, after several years of hard work, now mostly participate in high primary school classes, and twenty-five have already been promoted to amateur middle schools. In terms of agricultural technology, they have completed courses equivalent to those of agricultural secondary technical schools, and everyone has reached a level equivalent to that of a general rural technician.

"Production is the vanguard, martial arts training is like Wu Song," the girls never relax their martial arts training, whether day or night, in the cold winter or in the scorching summer. Their slogan is: "Train less when busy, train more when less busy, and seize the time at home when it rains or snows; aim three shots before and after meals, practice walking while walking, and practice rifles during rest." In more than a year, they have each developed martial arts skills. They not only know general queue movements and tactical movements, but the entire company has achieved excellent results in live rifle shooting. The county party committee recently conducted an assessment of their physical exercise, and the entire company passed the first-level labor and defense system, thirty-four passed the second-level labor and defense system, and twenty-five reached the level of third-level athletes.

One hundred and eight heroines have made lofty aspirations, and the banner of the Great Leap Forward that they hold high will forever fly over Jingyang Ridge.

    景阳岗上的女民兵
    景阳岗，这个传说武松打虎之地，被历代人们传颂。但是更值得称颂的，还在今天。从毛主席提出大办民兵师的伟大号召以来，这里不仅出现了几十个活武松，而且出现了一百单八个巾帼英雄。这一百零八个姑娘在党的领导教育下，组成了“钢铁姊妹连”，人人练就了一身武艺文才。她们在生产战线上特别活跃，成为景阳岗民兵营的主力军，连续数年高举丰产红旗，荣获奖状九百八十三张，被全国妇联奖为“三八红旗手”的先进单位。
    钢铁五姊妹
    “钢铁姊妹连”诞生在1959年春。她的光荣事迹，得从五个姑娘身上谈起。
    景阳岗原来是一个很贫困的地方，周围的土地不是沙碱就是死淤，人们辛勤劳动一年，有时连种子也捞不回来。合作化后的1957年冬，党提出大搞“深翻土地”的号召，掀起了群众性的改造沙碱地的热潮。景阳岗上五个十六、七岁的小姑娘高庆莲、高庆芝、王俊英、王秀琴、杨玉萍第一次合在一块，坚决响应党的号召，走上了改造大自然的战斗道路。经过七十个昼夜的奋斗，她们翻了一百零五亩冰冻的田地。从此，景阳岗上都知道有了“钢铁五姊妹”。
    冬去春来，“钢铁五姊妹”在新翻起来的土地上搞起十五亩丰产田。指标是：万斤地瓜，千斤粮。这么高的产量，在景阳岗谁也没见过。有的守旧的人就风言风语：“神仙能收万斤地瓜千斤粮，可是在你们这五个黄毛丫头身上，倒看不出什么神仙气来。”但是，党支持这些坚强的姑娘，并且给她们请来了高庆莲的爷爷当技术顾问。到了秋天，真是玉米长得赛棒槌，县委第一书记等领导同志都来验收。结果，玉米亩产一千一百二十三斤，地瓜亩产一万二千四百斤。
    生产突击队
    1958年秋，人民公社成立了。毛主席发出了“大办民兵师”的伟大号召，给景阳岗的人们带来了更大的活力。这天清晨，人们穿上新衣服。高庆莲、王月英等，高举着“钢铁五姊妹”、“东风姑娘队”、“火箭姑娘队”、“武松队”的队旗，前呼后拥，云集景阳岗。人们欢快地唱道：“一阵鞭炮连声响，人民公社到景阳，庄稼肥沃岗欢笑，人换思想地换装。”会上，以“钢铁五姊妹”为基础，与“东风姑娘队”、“火箭姑娘队”合并成一个“钢铁姊妹排”，高庆莲任排长，王月英、刘东月任副排长。组织扩大了，威力也更大了。她们坚决听党的话，敢想敢干。在四十五亩小麦丰产田上广泛采用先进耕作方法，在一片沙碱地上破天荒地夺得了平均亩产小麦八百二十八斤的大丰收。
    这时候，高庆莲带着姑娘们创作的“钢铁五姊妹之歌”，参加省跃进歌舞团到北京和武汉会演。她在武汉演出时见到了毛主席。毛主席亲切地握着她的手说，好呵，过去景阳岗是武松打虎之地，现在又出很多新英雄啦！毛主席鼓励她继续努力，跟乡亲们一起，彻底改变景阳岗的面貌。高庆莲把毛主席对景阳岗人民的希望写信告诉了乡亲们，全庄的人们如同都见了毛主席一样，他们在墙壁上写了十三个赤红大字：“以武松打虎的劲头，建设景阳岗”，掀起了更大的生产高潮。
    1959年春，“钢铁姊妹排”进一步扩大了。她们与袁凤梅领导的“刘胡兰排”合并，刚好一百单八将，成立了“钢铁姊妹连”。高庆莲任指导员，王俊英、李福芹任连长。丰产田由四十五亩，扩大成百亩丰产方。这百亩田地，整理得真是地平如镜，埂直如线，土细如面。可是，粗茁的禾苗长到三、四寸，百年未有的大旱降临了。
    慢说是旱灾，就是天上下火，也休想阻挡得住这些钢铁姑娘的丰产决心。高庆莲她们率领着这支民兵连，展开了有名的“百日抗旱”大战。当时天旱水浅，几昼夜就把水井打干了。此刻，上级党委发出指示，组织八个公社、三万人上阵，开挖一条百里长的干渠，引黄灌溉。景阳岗民兵营把最强的主力——“钢铁姊妹连”和“武松排”调了上去。出征之初，大队党总支书记郭忠玉亲自挂帅，布下比武擂台。分列两旁的男兵女将，个个神气百倍。高庆莲抢先提出：“五天任务，三天完成，首次报捷，誓夺头功！”另一旁闪出一条好汉，他叫高心孚，是景阳岗堂堂有名的“活武松”，素以打井闻名，他率领的武松队曾荣获百面红旗。他一见别人占先，就说：“好！过去都是俺家布擂，别人来打，今儿你们提出条件，咱就比个高低！”大家摆开阵势，只见男争女赛，并驾齐驱，不相上下，难解难分。第三天上午，高庆莲率领一百单八将，端着上写“大干苦干加巧干，五天任务三天完”的报喜匾，和“武松排”同时赶到郭书记跟前。党总支把两面锦旗，分别奖给了这两支生产战线上的尖兵。
    经过百日苦战，旱魔终于在这些巾帼英雄面前降伏了。一百亩丰产方，获得了平均亩产一千三百二十斤的大丰收。
    新时代的红专姑娘
    向更大的成就飞跃，“钢铁姊妹连”去秋和“武松排”一起，搞起小麦千亩丰产方。誓师大会这天，公社副主任、当日领导钢铁五姊妹翻地的高庆莲，代表钢铁姊妹和武松队员们在会上提出指标：“亩产千斤麦！”她说：“昔日武松只一个，今朝武松数不清。景阳一百单八将，赛过木兰和武松。大战二百四十天，确保小麦过千斤。”社员们被姑娘火热的语言所鼓舞，异口同声，要按照这个指标展开联环赛。依靠民兵的突击作用，十三天，连整地在内，他们把千亩小麦全部种上了，比其他丰产方，提前八天。现时，这片葱绿的麦苗，已长得齐膝盖，在全公社内，高高树起了首屈一指的第一类苗的红旗！人们题诗赞道：“春风和煦拂绿毯，钢铁姊妹似神仙，巧手日夜描又绣，千亩麦田如锦缎。”
    姑娘们要把自己造就成为有文化的新型农民。在党组织的领导下，田间办起了业余文化学校和业余农业技术学校。原先多数一字不识的农家姑娘，经过几年的努力，现在大多数都参加了高小班学习，有二十五人已升入了业余中学。在农业技术方面，她们已学完了相当于农业中等技术学校的课程，人人达到了相等于农村一般技术员的水平。
    “生产是尖兵，练武赛武松”，姑娘们无论在白天黑夜，寒冬、三伏，她们从不放松练武。她们的口号是：“大忙少训，小忙多训，下雨下雪在家抓紧训；饭前饭后瞄三枪，走路练步伐，休息练步枪。”一年多的时间，一个个练就全身武艺。她们不仅会一般队列动作和战术动作，而且全连步枪实弹射击，都取得了优秀成绩。县委不久前对她们的体育锻炼举行了一次考核，全连全体通过了一级劳卫制，三十四人通过了二级劳卫制，二十五人达到了三级运动员的水平。
    一百单八个巾帼英雄，立下凌云壮志，她们高举着的大跃进的旗帜，永远飘扬在景阳岗上。
