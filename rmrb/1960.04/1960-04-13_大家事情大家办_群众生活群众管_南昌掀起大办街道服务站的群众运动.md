Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 12th: In order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, the residents of Nanchang's streets have launched a mass movement to establish street service stations.

At present, the city has established a total of fifty-six service stations, with one hundred and forty-one sub-stations, and four hundred and sixty-nine service groups organized according to location and type of work, with a total of six thousand four hundred and thirty-two service personnel. Basically, every street has a service station, every residents' committee has a service group, and every section has a service worker, forming a service network with wide coverage, diverse projects, and flexible and convenient methods. This mass service organization plays an important role in supporting the continuous leap forward in production and construction, comprehensively arranging the people's economic life, and enhancing the people's socialist and communist ideological awareness.

The street service stations in Nanchang City emerged on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in production. Since the Great Leap Forward, more than 50,000 housewives in the city have successively taken up production and work posts, and the housework of many families needs to be undertaken by a mass social organization. Thus, street service stations came into being.

These service stations establish service projects according to the needs of production and the people's lives, generally with more than forty service projects. In areas with many workers, more life service projects are carried out; in areas with many factories, more processing projects are carried out; in areas with fewer commercial outlets, more consignment and agency projects are carried out. In terms of service methods, a combination of decentralization and centralization is adopted, with decentralization as the main method. The station level mainly undertakes and distributes large-scale businesses, contacts and solves problems in terms of raw materials, and conducts unified management and arrangement of the work of various sub-stations and groups.

Many service personnel work enthusiastically for the masses without regard to time, remuneration, or hardship. The Sanzhu Road Service Station has served more than 28,000 times for more than 5,000 workers and masses in eighteen factories and enterprises, with sewing and mending alone reaching more than 15,000 pieces. The Dashi Yuan Service Station often helps neighboring workers clean their homes, take care of their children, attend to the sick, buy coal briquettes, move houses, etc., so that workers can get enough rest in their spare time and have greater enthusiasm for work.

More than 70% of the city's service stations have carried out processing and production and short-distance transportation businesses, providing a large amount of auxiliary labor for nearby factories and enterprises. Before the Spring Festival, the Menlu Service Station organized a processing group to assist the Rubber Raincoat Factory in completing the task of buttonholing 12,000 sets of raincoats, enabling the factory to transfer 50 buttonholing female workers to rubber production, realizing a "good start" in 1960. The Newly Built Back Wall Service Station has shredded more than 11,000 kilograms of cloth scraps for the Plastic Factory in the past few months. The Guiwang Factory Service Station processes sock bottoms and gloves for the Leather Sewing Factory every month, which has strongly supported factory production.

The service stations enthusiastically assist commercial departments in doing a good job in the supply and distribution of certain commodities to supplement the shortcomings of commercial outlets. The service stations in the Xiashawo area supply more than 7,000 kilograms of vegetables to the Vegetable Company and sell about 3,000 yuan worth of goods for the Trading Company every month, and deliver vegetables to homes according to needs.

Because this service organization, distributed in the streets and alleys, enthusiastically serves the masses, it has established a new trend of "everyone handles public affairs, the masses manage their own lives," mutual care, mutual assistance, and helping others in the street residents.

    南昌掀起大办街道服务站的群众运动
    据新华社南昌12日电　南昌的街道居民适应生产大跃进需要，掀起了大办街道服务站的群众运动。
    目前，全市共建立起服务站五十六个，下设分站一百四十一处，按地段、工种分别编成服务小组四百六十九个，共有服务人员六千四百三十二名。基本上达到街街有服务站，委委（居民委员会）有服务组，段段有服务员，形成了一个分布面广、项目多种多样、方式灵活方便的服务网。这种群众性的服务组织，对于支援生产建设的持续跃进，全面安排人民的经济生活，提高人们的社会主义和共产主义思想觉悟，起着重要的作用。
    南昌市的街道服务站是在生产不断大跃进的基础上产生的。自从大跃进以来，全市已有五万多名家庭妇女陆续走上了生产和工作岗位，许多家庭的家务事，需要有一种群众性的社会组织来担任，于是街道服务站便应运而生。
    这些服务站根据生产和群众生活需要，设立服务项目，一般有四十多个服务项目。在职工多的地区，搞生活服务性的较多；在工厂多的地区，搞加工性的较多；在商业网点少的地区，搞代销代办性的较多。在服务方式上，采取了分散与集中相结合的方法，并且以分散为主。站一级主要是承揽和分配大项业务，联系和解决原料材料等方面的问题，对各分站和小组的工作进行统一管理，统一安排。
    许多服务员不计时间，不计报酬，不辞劳苦地热心为群众办事。三住路服务站先后为十八个工厂、企业单位的五千多名职工群众服务过二万八千多次，仅缝补一项即达一万五千多件。大士院服务站经常帮助邻近职工打扫家庭，照顾孩子，侍候病人，买煤球，搬家等，使职工们在业余时间能够得到足够的休息，劳动干劲更大。
    全市有70％以上的服务站开展了加工生产和短途运输业务，为附近工厂、企业提供了大量辅助劳动力。门路服务站在春节以前组织加工组，协助橡胶雨衣厂完成了一万二千套雨衣锁扣眼任务，使这个厂腾出五十名锁眼女工转入橡胶生产，实现了1960年开门红。新建后墙服务站，几个月来为塑料厂剪碎布一万一千多斤，桂旺厂服务站每月为革属缝制厂加工袜底和手套，都有力地支援了工厂生产。
    各服务站热心地协助商业部门做好某些商品的供应分配工作，以补商业点的不足。下沙窝一带的服务站每月为蔬菜公司供应居民蔬菜七千多斤，为贸易公司代销商品三千元左右，并根据需要送菜上门。
    由于这个分布在大街小巷的服务组织热情地为群众服务，在街道居民中树立了“大家的事情大家办，群众的生活群众管”，互相关心、互相帮助、助人为乐的新风尚。
