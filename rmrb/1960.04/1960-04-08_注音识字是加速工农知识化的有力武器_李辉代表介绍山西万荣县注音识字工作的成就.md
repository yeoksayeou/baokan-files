Comrades, Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by the two Vice Premiers Li and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. These reports clearly demonstrate that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the 650 million people of our country have created the miraculous achievement of completing the Five-Year Plan in two years with unparalleled enthusiasm and wisdom. The high-speed development of socialist construction has brought about earth-shaking changes in the people's mental outlook. New things are emerging and growing in large numbers in every place and on every front, converging into a magnificent torrent of continuous revolution. The phonetic literacy work in Wanrong County is just one of the thousands of new things, but it has left a very deep impression on me.

“Studying culture year after year, new words are always hard to remember”

Wanrong County in the Jinan Prefecture of Shanxi Province is located on the Loess Plateau at an altitude of 800 meters. It mainly produces cotton, wheat, and oil crops. Due to the thick soil and deep water, water sources are very scarce. In the past, it suffered from drought nine years out of ten, and agricultural production was affected by drought for a long time, preventing its good development. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the 210,000 people of the county liberated their minds, mustered their energy, and determined to fight to completely change the drought-stricken situation and strive for agricultural abundance. Under the leadership of the Wanrong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they launched a magnificent mass movement to build water conservancy projects, develop indigenous fertilizers, indigenous pesticides, and indigenous mechanization. The masses' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, but they also deeply felt the pain that "water conservancy and mechanization cannot be achieved without culture." For example, at that time, the Qinggu Management District of the Wangxian People's Commune bought a gas engine, but no one knew how to operate it; a local fertilizer factory was built, but no one understood the technology; led by the deputy secretary of the branch, a dozen people were organized to install a power stone mill, but they had not completed the installation after two months. The deputy secretary of the branch said in distress: "We can't even install a power stone mill, how can we achieve mechanization and electrification? It will be even more difficult to do things without culture in the future." Therefore, the masses urgently demanded to learn culture and rapidly improve their scientific, cultural, and production technology levels.

However, learning culture also encountered the problem of method. First of all, the difficulty of written language has always been difficult to overcome. In Wanrong County in 1958, there were more than 38,000 illiterate young and middle-aged people. By October 1958, more than 34,000 had been eliminated. However, the results of literacy were not consolidated. People who had become literate had limited literacy skills, could not read books or write articles, and the phenomenon of relapse and re-illiteracy was quite serious. In 1958 alone, more than 14,000 relapsed and became re-illiterate. The masses were very distressed and reflected that "Learning Chinese characters is really a torment, each character has its own features, you memorize it for half the night, and it changes its face by dawn." They also said, "Studying culture year after year, new words are always hard to remember, you only read one book in a few years, forgetting what you learned before, it's useless." In order to solve this problem, the County Party Committee, under the instructions of the higher Party Committee, decided to adopt the "Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet," approved and promulgated by the National People's Congress in February 1958, to annotate Chinese characters with phonetic symbols as a tool to help literacy. From August 1958, after three stages of small-scale field trials, large-scale field promotion, and county-wide implementation, the method of phonetic literacy was promoted throughout the county.

Phonetic alphabet is a treasure, once learned, never forgotten

The phonetic literacy work of more than one year has achieved unexpected results in Wanrong County.

First, it accelerated the speed of literacy. Generally, rural youth can learn the phonetic alphabet after 15 to 20 hours of study, and adults can learn it after 20 to 30 hours of study; then, by using the phonetic alphabet to read phonetic literacy textbooks and practice writing for about 100 hours, they can recognize 1,500 Chinese characters and reach the literacy graduation standard. This shortens the time by more than half compared to the ordinary 300-hour literacy program. Now all of the more than 13,200 illiterate young and middle-aged people in the county have become literate, averaging only two months. The number of literate young and middle-aged people in the county has reached 97.2%. The masses said, "The phonetic alphabet is the key, it is the teacher of Chinese characters, the key is like a magic mirror, sweeping away all illiteracy." They also said, "The phonetic alphabet is learned quickly, used skillfully, and remembered firmly, illiteracy has been swept away all at once."

Second, it fundamentally solved the problem of consolidation and improvement after literacy, and eliminated the phenomenon of relapse and re-illiteracy. After becoming literate, students can read a large number of popular readings on politics, culture, and science and technology with phonetic notation without being limited by the amount of characters they know and without the need for teachers. This not only consolidates the characters they have already learned, but also increases the characters they do not know; it not only improves their reading ability, but also improves their writing ability; it not only acquires knowledge, but also changes local dialects and naturally promotes Mandarin.

Now, almost every young and middle-aged farmer in Wanrong County reads books, some have read more than a dozen books, some have read dozens of books, and some have read one or two hundred books. Farmers in the Qinggu Management District of Wangxian People's Commune have read an average of seventy or eighty books per person. Moreover, some people are also reading phonetic versions of Chairman Mao's works. More than 8,700 farmers and rural cadres in the county have participated in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. In one Liu Village Management District, after phonetic literacy, the number of people participating in the study group of Chairman Mao's works increased from the original twelve to more than eight hundred.

In Wanrong County, reading has become a trend and a habit for farmers. They said, "We are so fascinated by reading phonetic books that we can't sleep at night without finishing a new book." Wang Enchan, a female commune member who had just become literate, said, "Books are really good things, the more you read, the more you want to read, if you don't read for one night, you feel uncomfortable." From November 1959 to now, the county has sold 374,000 copies of phonetic books alone. Some farmers, after reading several phonetic books, can even read books without phonetic notation due to the increase in the number of characters they know. Some are even reading large literary novels such as "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," "Railway Guerrilla," "Bitter Vegetables," and "How Steel Was Tempered." Last winter, due to the temporary shortage of phonetic readings, every time new books arrived, there was a gratifying and unprecedented phenomenon of farmers lining up to buy and borrow books in rural areas. In other words, there was a "book famine" in the countryside! Seeing this situation, someone couldn't help but exclaim excitedly, "This is truly the elimination of illiteracy!" At the end of last year, the Provincial Department of Education and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a provincial on-site conference in Wanrong to promote phonetic literacy and popularize Mandarin. Comrade Wu Yuzhang sent a congratulatory telegram. Wu Yuzhang also said in his congratulatory telegram: "After mastering the phonetic alphabet, the farmers in Wanrong County not only quickly shed the hat of illiteracy, but are also reading a large number of popular readings with phonetic notation. It is only when a farmer can continue to read books that he is truly and permanently free from illiteracy. Such a person will not 'relapse,' but on the contrary, will continue to improve." In addition to phonetic readings, farmers also subscribe to phonetic tabloids and non-phonetic county newspapers and the "Shanxi Youth Daily." The "Wanrong Phonetic Newspaper," run by the county, is distributed 9,000 copies per issue, averaging one copy for every five households in the county. Some farmers also read "People's Daily" and other newspapers and periodicals such as "Red Flag" and "Forward."

Learn the alphabet and know the phonetics, the sound of books is all over the land, and poems fill the village

Reading also promotes writing. Because they have learned the phonetic alphabet, if they can't write a character, they can first use the alphabet to spell the sound instead, and then look up the dictionary to fill it in after writing, so that their thoughts will not be interrupted and their language will not be limited by the characters, which greatly reduces the difficulty of writing. To date, farmers in the county have created more than 1.9 million poems, many of which are excellent works, and many rural poets have emerged. For example, recently, when the delegation of the National Rural Cultural Work Conference visited the county, Xu Guangxiao, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture, gave a topic and asked literate farmers to compose poems on the spot. The topic given by Deputy Minister Xu was "Wanrong is a Good Place." Li Taibai, Wang Fenghang, Cheng Kuanniu, and Wang Minying, four literate farmers who participated in the poem-making, handed in their papers in less than four minutes.

Li Taibai's poem is:

"Wanrong is a good place, the beautiful Gu Mountain is in the center.
In the past, the mountainsides were full of weeds, now the mountains are full of flowers and fruits.
In the past, Wanrong was dry land, now it has become irrigated land.
In the past, Wanrong had many illiterates, now everyone writes poems.
With the good leadership of the Party, the people will always enjoy happiness."

Wang Fenghang's poem is:

"Wanrong is a good place, all kinds of work shine brightly.
Grain and cotton yields have multiplied several times, and phonetic literacy takes the lead.
The sound of reading is all over Wanrong, and illiterates in Wanrong open their eyes.
Sports training 'Seagull Team,' 'Three Three One Two' Wuting Village.
The Party's leadership is truly wise, and Wanrong is all red."

Cheng Kuanniu's poem is:

"Wanrong is a good place, 210,000 people are full of joy.
Abundant products, increased grain and cotton, and phonetic literacy are all red.
Illiterates become cultural people, Wanrong's atmosphere is brand new."

Wang Minying's poem is:

"Wanrong is a good place, the songs of victory resound through the sky.
210,000 people work hard, and two satellites are launched into the sky.
One satellite launches Mandarin, and one satellite launches an illiterate-free county.
All kinds of work leap forward together, and happy life is boundless."

In addition to writing poetry, literate farmers also write essays, letters, reading notes, and study notes. What is especially touching is that many production team leaders who could not even recognize their own names a year ago can now write work assignment slips themselves every day, replacing the characters they cannot write with the phonetic alphabet. What is also touching is that farmers have begun to write applications to join the Party and the League with their own hands, expressing their ardent desire to dedicate their lives to communism to the Party with words full of sincerity.

Because 140,000 people in the county have participated in the study of the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and because after learning the phonetic alphabet, both those who are becoming literate and those who have become literate are reading a large number of phonetic books and newspapers, the promotion of Mandarin has also been extremely smooth through the phonetic correction function of phonetic books and newspapers. First of all, the atmosphere has been greatly opened up, and no one considers it strange to speak Mandarin anymore; secondly, with the knowledge of phonetics, no one considers it difficult to speak Mandarin anymore. Now half of the population in the county can speak and speak Mandarin. Cheng Shuqian, a female commune member who became literate, wrote a poem saying: "Phonetic literacy is a good method, one tree blooms two flowers: one flower removes the illiterate hat, and one flower learns Mandarin."

Culture promotes great production, and the spiritual outlook changes greatly

The phonetic literacy work in Wanrong County has also been extremely significant in promoting production, raising political awareness, changing the spiritual outlook, and transforming social customs. There are also many new people and new things. For example, the young farmer Cheng Kuanniu was once known as "Muddlehead." Although his family had been beggars and long-term laborers for three generations, he only turned over after liberation, but he had never been politically active. On the contrary, because he had been allocated land, cattle, and houses after the land reform, and his life had improved, he gradually developed the ideas of a well-to-do middle peasant. After phonetic literacy, he was greatly moved by reading his first phonetic reading, "Liu Jiemei Forgets Her Roots and Turns Back," and felt very uncomfortable, feeling that he was also a forgetful person, and hid in the corner of the room and cried. Later, he read phonetic readings on agricultural production, and combined what he saw in the books with his knowledge in practice to try planting experimental plots of cotton and sweet potatoes. As a result, under the unprecedentedly severe conditions of natural disasters in 1959, he achieved exceptionally high yields of cotton and sweet potatoes, with per-mu yields more than twice and once again the local yields, respectively. In one year, this young farmer went from being a backward commune member to a production pacesetter, from being someone who only cared about his individual family to a new farmer who was determined to "do whatever the Party tells him to do" and "everything for communism." Last summer, he wrote an application to join the League with his own hands and became a member of the Communist Youth League. Later, he became the deputy captain of the production team, and at the end of the year, he joined the Party and became a glorious Communist Party member. Another example is the female livestock breeder Guo Huahua, who was originally not satisfied with her work. After phonetic literacy, she read the phonetic reading "Model Livestock Breeder" and was moved by the spirit of the female livestock breeder Long Muzhen in the book. She specialized in reading books and newspapers on pig raising, studying pig raising methods. As a result, she increased the number of pigs she managed from six to thirty, and all of them were healthy. She was rated as a model three times and became a model livestock breeder in the county. Another example is the entire membership of the indigenous fertilizer plant in the Sunji Management District of the Sunji Commune, who, after reading a large number of scientific and technological phonetic readings, successfully imitated the production of mixed fertilizers of "nitrogen," "phosphorus," and "potassium" and more than ten other types of indigenous fertilizers. Another example is Wang Sanwa, a worker at the Sunji Commune Comprehensive Processing Plant, who, after thirteen days of painstaking research, successfully imitated and produced a wheat cleaning machine that could clean more than 10,000 catties of wheat a day, which is 25 times more efficient than manual wheat cleaning. In short, the result of farmers learning culture is the immediate promotion of production development and the improvement of ideological awareness. As Chairman Mao said: "Raising the political and cultural level of the masses through cultural and educational work is also of great importance to the development of the national economy."

1959, the year when Wanrong County vigorously carried out phonetic literacy, was also a year when Wanrong County suffered extremely severe natural disasters: a hundred days of severe drought, five hailstorms, and five insect plagues, plus a major flood that had not been seen in a century, which washed away half of the houses in the urban area. However, the county's per-mu yield of grain in 1959 still increased by 26% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958, cotton increased by 3.8%, and oil crops increased by 36.3%. The urban area destroyed by the flood was rebuilt in less than three months. This fact more convincingly illustrates the truth that the development of production promotes culture, and the development of culture in turn promotes production.

As for the change in the people's spiritual outlook and social customs, it can be seen from the fact that many elderly women also carry schoolbags, learn phonetics, organize "elderly classes," perform spelling, reading, poetry making, speaking Mandarin on the spot, as well as performing Yangko dances and kicking shuttlecocks. There are a few sentences in a poem created by the Wanrong County Elderly Class: "Pine trees grow greener and greener, the older people live, the younger they become, the Communist Party's leadership is really good, I still feel like I want to live fifty more years." After seeing the rural areas of Wanrong County, where illiteracy was eliminated during the Great Leap Forward, no one can deny that the Chinese farmers of today are so ideologically liberated and in such a comfortable mood.

One book used to take two years to learn, now it only takes half a year

The phonetic literacy work in Wanrong County not only showed its effect in literacy, but also played a role in the Chinese teaching of spare-time primary schools and primary schools. After the Chinese textbook of the spare-time primary school was annotated with phonetics, the textbook that originally took eighty hours to teach can now be taught in only thirty hours, and the teaching quality is higher than usual. According to the results of the pilot project in the Sunji Management District, students can generally recognize about 3,400 characters, can read "People's Daily" and "Shanxi Daily," and can also write short essays of five to six hundred words in about an hour. It originally took two years (240 hours) to teach all three Chinese textbooks in the spare-time senior primary class. According to Wanrong's experience, by fully utilizing the role of the phonetic alphabet and improving teaching methods, it can be taught in only half a year.

The effect of the Chinese phonetic alphabet in primary school Chinese teaching is also very prominent: it accelerates the speed of literacy and expands the amount of literacy. In the past, primary school students in lower grades could generally consolidate and master only about 70% of the new characters they had learned, and students in higher grades still could not remember some characters firmly after class. Now, children can recognize characters by spelling them with the phonetic alphabet, which is fast and accurate, so they can concentrate their efforts to strengthen the differentiation of character shapes and the understanding of character meanings. Students can read the new textbooks before the teachers teach them. Yang Shufang and other students in the first grade of Wanrong Chengguan Primary School, after learning the phonetic alphabet, can not only quickly master the new characters they have already learned, but also learn the 360 new characters in the second Chinese textbook in advance. It can not only improve the literacy rate, but also improve the reading ability of primary school students and accelerate the cultivation of children's reading habits and writing ability. In the past, primary school Chinese teaching focused on literacy and did not pay attention to extracurricular reading. Moreover, because students did not know enough characters, it was difficult for ordinary junior primary school students to read books and newspapers. Reading picture books was also just looking at the pictures without knowing the words. Now, first graders can be taught to write and write simple diaries, second graders can learn to look up dictionaries and write short essays of more than 100 words, fourth graders could only write short essays of 200 words in the past, now they can write essays of 600 words, and they can also write poetry. I met a fourth-grade student in Linyi, the ten-year-old little poet He Mengxiong, who read 150 books in half a year and wrote more than 1,500 poems in a year. We gave him a topic on the spot and he wrote seven poems, he could write one almost in a minute, and they were all very good. For example, on the theme of younger brother, his poem is: "My family has a younger brother, he smiles in his sleep in the middle of the night, I ask him what he is smiling about, he says he dreams of Chairman Mao." Wanrong County also tried to teach the phonetic alphabet in the senior class of kindergartens in conjunction with various game activities, and it was also successful. Some middle-class children learned very well, such as Wu Jiansheng, a five-year-old child in Ronghe Kindergarten, who can spell any sentence with the phonetic alphabet and mark the four tones correctly.

The experience of Wanrong County shows in many ways the correctness of the Party's policy on language reform. It shows that phonetic literacy is not only a shortcut to the intellectualization of workers and peasants, which can accelerate the process of cultural and technological revolution and create extremely favorable conditions for our country's transition from socialism to communism, but also provides a very powerful basis for teaching revolution and opens up a new path for the revolution of the school system, curriculum, teaching content, and teaching methods of our country's full-time schools, half-day schools, and industrial and agricultural spare-time schools. Teaching children the phonetic alphabet in the senior class of kindergartens, and completing the content of the six-year primary school Chinese textbook in only four years, lays a good foundation for the reform of the school system in middle and primary schools and the promotion of Mandarin. The years of industrial and agricultural spare-time education can also be greatly shortened. It takes at most four months to reach the literacy graduation standard, and one year to successfully complete the Chinese and arithmetic teaching tasks of the spare-time senior primary school. Therefore, promoting phonetic literacy is a major issue that is closely related to the interests of the entire people and the acceleration of socialist construction. After the Shanxi Provincial Committee held a field conference in Wanrong County, the Provincial People's Committee promptly issued "Instructions on Promoting the Use of the Phonetic Alphabet to Improve the Cultural and Scientific Knowledge Level of Workers and Peasants and Promote Mandarin," and a climax of promoting phonetic literacy was launched throughout the province. After our Jinan Prefectural Committee held a mobile on-site conference of first secretaries of various counties in January this year, we also promptly made a decision: "To quickly launch a mass movement to learn Chinese phonetics throughout the region." At present, the number of farmers in our region participating in the study of Chinese phonetics has reached 1.14 million, exceeding the total number of 1.13 million young and middle-aged people in the region; the number of literate young and middle-aged people has reached one million, reaching 89% of the total number of young and middle-aged people, and the number of people participating in spare-time primary schools and spare-time junior high schools has reached 300,000. A mass movement for the whole people to learn Chinese phonetics has been launched vigorously.

The current problems are: uneven development, and there is still a great lack of phonetic textbooks and popular phonetic readings, which cannot meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner. However, we believe that these problems can be solved quickly. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we are fully determined and confident that in the general situation of socialist construction entering a new stage in 1960, on the basis of promoting the Wanrong experience, we will advance the cultural revolution movement of industrial and agricultural spare-time education and the masses in our province to a new and greatly leaping new era.

Please correct any inadequacies in the above speech.

专栏：

    注音识字是加速工农知识化的有力武器
    李辉代表介绍山西万荣县注音识字工作的成就各位代表：
    我完全拥护两位李副总理所作的报告和人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。在这些报告里清楚地看出，我国六亿五千万人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，以无比的热忱和智慧创造了五年计划两年完成的人类历史的奇迹，而社会主义建设事业高速度的发展，又使得人民的精神面貌发生着日新月异的变化。在每个地方每一条战线上新生事物都在大批产生和成长，汇成了雄伟壮丽的不断革命的巨流。万荣县的注音识字工作只是千千万万新生事物中的一个，但给了我极深刻的印象。
    “成年累月学文化，生字老是记不下”
    山西省晋南专区万荣县，地处拔海八百米的黄土高原，主产棉、麦和油料作物，因地厚水深，水源很缺，过去十年九旱，农业生产长期受着干旱影响，不能很好发展。1958年大跃进中，全县二十一万人民，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，解放了思想，鼓足了干劲，决心为彻底改变干旱面貌，争取农业丰产而斗争。他们在中共县委的领导下，开展了一个波澜壮阔的兴修水利、大搞土化肥、土农药和土机械化的群众运动。群众的生产积极性空前高涨，但同时也深刻感到了“水利化，机械化，没有文化不能化”的痛苦。例如那时王显人民公社的青谷管理区，买了一部煤气机，没有人会开；建起一座土化肥厂，没有人懂技术；由支部副书记带头，组织了十几个人安装一座动力石磨，装了两个月还没有装成。支部副书记苦恼地说：“一个动力石磨都安不成，还搞得成机械化和电气化？往后没有文化更难办事了。”因此群众迫切要求学文化，要求迅速提高科学、文化和生产技术水平。
    可是学文化又碰到一个方法的问题，首先是文字这一难关始终不容易突破。万荣县1958年有三万八千多个青壮年文盲，到1958年10月为止，先后扫除了三万四千多名，但是扫盲的成果很不巩固，脱盲的人，识字有限，不能看书作文，而且回生复盲的现象相当严重，1958年回生复盲的就有一万四千多名。群众十分苦恼，反映说：“学汉字真熬煎，一个字一个眉眼，学半夜把它记住，到天亮它又翻脸”。又说：“成年累月学文化，生字老是记不下，几年才念一本书，前学后忘不顶啥。”县委为了解决这一问题，在上级党委指示下，决定采用1958年2月全国人民代表大会批准公布的“汉语拼音方案”，给汉字注音，作为帮助识字的工具。从1958年8月起，经过小田试验、大田推广和全县开花三个阶段，全县推行了注音识字的办法。
    拼音字母是个宝，学会再也忘不了
    一年多的注音识字工作，在万荣县得到了意想不到的效果。
    第一是加快了扫盲速度。一般农村青年经过十五至二十小时的学习，壮年经过二十至三十小时的学习，就可以学会拼音字母；然后再用一百小时左右的时间，利用拼音字母阅读注音识字课本和练习写作，就能认识一千五百个汉字，达到扫盲毕业标准。这样比普通三百小时的扫盲，要缩短一半以上的时间。现在全县一万三千二百多个青壮年文盲已经全部脱盲，平均只用了两个月的时间。全县青壮年的识字人数，达到97.2％。群众说：“注音字母是钥匙，它给汉字当老师，钥匙好比开心镜，所有文盲都扫净”。又说：“拼音字母学的快，用的巧，记的牢，这一下子文盲扫掉了”。
    第二是根本解决了脱盲以后的巩固提高问题，杜绝了回生复盲现象。脱盲以后的学员，可以不受识字量的限制，在无需人教的情况下，大量阅读注音的政治、文化和科学技术的通俗读物。这样不仅巩固了已识的字，还增识了不识的字；不仅提高了阅读能力，还提高了写作能力；不仅获得了知识，还改变了方言土语，自然而然地推广了普通话。
    现在万荣县的青壮年农民，几乎人人读书，有的读了十几本，有的读了几十本，有的读了一、二百本。王显人民公社青谷管理区的农民，每人平均读了七、八十本。而且有些人还在读注音的毛主席著作。全县有八千七百多个农民和农村干部参加了学习毛主席著作的运动。有一个刘村管理区，注音扫盲以后，参加学习毛主席著作小组的人，从原来的十二人增加到八百多人。
    万荣县的农民，现在读书成了风气，成了习惯。他们说：“我们读注音读物像着了迷一样，买到一本新书，晚上不看完就睡不着觉。”刚脱盲的女社员王恩婵说：“书真是个好东西，越看越想看，一晚上不看，就感到别扭得不行”。从1959年11月到现在，光是注音读物，全县就销售了三十七万四千册。有的农民读过若干册注音读物以后，由于识字量增加，连不注音的读物也能看了。有的甚至在看《林海雪原》《铁道游击队》《苦菜花》《钢铁是怎样炼成的》等大部头的文艺小说。去年冬天，由于注音读物一度脱销，每次新书一到，农村里竟然出现农民排队买书和借书的史无前例的可喜的现象，也就是说，农村闹了书荒！有人看到这种情形，不禁兴奋地说：“这才真正是扫了文盲的局面！”去年年底，省教育厅和团省委在万荣召开全省的推行注音扫盲和推广普通话现场会议，吴老拍来了贺电。吴老贺电中也说：“万荣县的农民掌握了拼音字母之后，不仅很快摘掉文盲帽子，而且正在大量阅读注音的通俗读物。一个农民能够继续不断地看书，这才是真正永远地摆脱了文盲状态，这样的人，就不会‘回生’，而且相反，他会不断提高。”除了注音读物之外，农民还订阅注音的小报和不注音的县报以及《山西青年报》。县里办的《万荣拼音报》，每期发行九千份，平均全县每五户就有一份。有的农民还阅读《人民日报》和《红旗》《前进》等报刊。
  学了字母会拼音，书声遍地诗满村
    阅读同时又带动了写作。由于学会了拼音字母，写不出的字可以先用字母拼了音代替，写完再查字典补上，这样思路就不会打断，语言也不会受文字的限制，大大减少了写作的困难。全县农民到现在为止，已经创作诗歌一百九十多万首，其中有不少优秀作品，也出现不少农村诗人。例如最近全国农村文化工作会议参观团去县里参观，由文化部徐光肖副部长出题，让脱盲农民即席作诗。徐副部长出的题目叫《万荣是个好地方》，四个参加做诗的脱盲农民李太白、王丰恒、程宽牛、王民英，不到四分钟都交了卷。
    李太白做的诗是：
    “万荣是个好地方，美丽的孤山在中央。
    过去荒草满山坡，现在满山花果香。
    过去万荣是旱地，现在变成水浇田。
    过去万荣文盲多，现在人人写诗歌。
    有了党的好领导，人民永远享快乐。”王丰恒做的诗是：
    “万荣是个好地方，各项工作放光芒。
    粮棉产量翻几番，注音扫盲占了先。
    万荣一片读书声，万荣文盲把眼睁。
    体育锻炼‘海鸥队’，‘三三一二’乌停村。
    党的领导真英明，万荣样样满堂红。”程宽牛做的诗是：
    “万荣是个好地方，二十一万人民喜洋洋。
    物产丰富粮棉增，注音扫盲满堂红。
    文盲变成文化人，万荣气象一片新。”王民英做的诗是：
    “万荣是个好地方，胜利的歌声震天响。
    二十一万人民拼命干，两颗卫星放上天。
    一颗放的普通话，一颗放的无盲县。
    各项工作齐跃进，幸福生活乐无边。”
    除了做诗之外，脱盲的农民还作文、写信、写读书心得、读书笔记。尤其使人感动的是，一年前连自己姓名也不认得的好些生产队长，现在都能每天自己写调工牌，写不出的字就用字母拼了音代替。还有使人感动的是农民开始用自己的手写入党和入团申请书，用充满真情实意的话，向党表达出一生为共产主义奋斗的热烈愿望。
    由于全县有十四万人参加了汉语拼音字母的学习，又由于学会拼音字母以后，不论扫盲的或已脱盲的人都在大量阅读注音的书报，于是通过注音书报的正音作用，普通话的推广也极为顺利。首先是风气大开，没有人再以说普通话为怪事；其次是有了拼音的知识，没有人再以说普通话为难事。现在全县有一半的人口能说能讲普通话。脱盲的女社员程淑欠写了一首诗说：“注音扫盲好办法，一树开下两朵花：一朵摘掉文盲帽，一朵学会普通话。”
    文化促进大生产，精神面貌大改变
    万荣县的注音识字工作，在推动生产，提高政治觉悟，改变精神面貌，以及转变社会风气等等方面的效果，也极为显著，新人新事也非常多。例如青年农民程宽牛，过去人称“闷”，虽然三辈子要饭当长工，解放后才翻了身，但是政治上一直不开展。相反，由于土改后分到田，分到牛，分到房屋，生活改善，逐渐滋长了富裕中农的思想。注音扫盲后他阅读第一本注音读物《刘介梅忘本回头》，就大为激动，心里难受得不得了，觉得自己也是忘本人，躲在屋角里哭起来。以后他又阅读农业生产的注音读物，把书上看到的东西结合自己实践中的知识，试种了棉花和红薯的试验田，结果在1959年自然灾害空前严重的条件下，获得了棉花亩产量高出当地两倍，红薯亩产量高出当地一倍的特大丰产。这个青年农民在一年中从落后社员成为生产标兵，从只关心个人家庭的人变为决心“党叫他干啥，他啥也干”，“一切为了共产主义”的新农民。去年夏天，他用自己的手写了入团申请书，成了共青团员，后来又当了生产队副队长，年底的时候入了党，成了光荣的共产党员。又如女饲养员郭花花，原来不安心工作，注音扫盲后读了注音读物《模范饲养员》，为书中女饲养员龙目珍的精神所感动，就专找养猪的书报来看，钻研养猪方法，结果由管理六头猪增加到三十头，头头无病，被评了三次模范，成了县里的模范饲养员。又如孙吉公社孙吉管理区土化肥厂的全体成员，在阅读大量科学技术的注音读物以后，仿制成了“氮”“磷”“钾”的混合肥料和其它土化肥十多种。又如孙吉公社综合加工厂的工人王三娃，经过十三天的苦心钻研，仿制成功一部净麦机，一天能净麦一万多斤，比人工净麦提高二十五倍。总之，农民学文化的结果，立竿见影地促进了生产的发展，提高了思想的觉悟。正如毛主席所说的：“用文化教育工作提高群众的政治和文化的水平，这对于发展国民经济同样有极大的重要性”。
    万荣县大搞注音识字的1959年，也就是万荣县自然灾害极为严重的一年：百日大旱，五次雹灾和五次虫灾，还加上百年来未有的大洪水，把城关区的房屋冲掉了一半。但是全县1959年的粮食亩产量仍旧比大跃进的1958年增长26％，棉花增长了3.8％，油料作物增长36.3％。被大水冲毁的城关区，不到三个月时间，就重建起来。这个事实更令人信服地说明生产的发展推动文化，文化的发展又反过来促进生产的真理。
    至于人民精神面貌和社会风气的改变，只要从许多老年妇女也背书包，学拼音，组织“老年班”，当场表演拼写，读书，做诗，说普通话，以及扭秧歌，踢毽子等，就可以看出来。万荣县老年班创作的诗歌中有这样几句话：“松树越长越发青，老人越活越年轻，共产党领导真正好，我再活五十还嫌少”。看了大跃进中扫了盲的万荣县农村，谁也不能否认今天的中国农民是如此思想解放，心情舒畅。
  一书过去学两年，现在半年就学完
    万荣县注音识字工作不但在扫盲方面显出效果，而且在业余初等学校和小学的语文教学方面，也发挥了作用。业余初等学校的语文课本加上注音以后，原来需要八十小时才能教完的一册课本，现在只要三十小时就能教完，而且教学质量比一般要高。根据孙吉管理区试点的结果，学员普遍能识到三千四百字左右，能读《人民日报》和《山西日报》，还能在一小时左右的时间内写五六百字的短文。业余高小班的三册语文课本，原来要两年的时间（二百四十小时）才能教完，根据万荣的经验，充分发挥拼音字母的作用，并改进教学方法之后，只要半年的时间就能教完。
    汉语拼音在小学语文教学中的效果也是非常突出的：加快了识字速度，扩大了识字量。过去，小学低年级学生对于学过的生字，一般仅仅能够巩固的掌握70％左右，高年级学生在上课以后，仍然有些字不能牢记。现在儿童用拼音字母一拼就会识字，识的既快，读的又准确，识字快了就可以集中力量加强对字形的辨别和字义的理解。新的教材老师还没有讲，学生就能够读。万荣城关小学一年级的学生杨淑芳等学会拼音字母后，不仅能够迅速掌握已经学过的生字，而且提前学会了第二册语文课本上的三百六十个生字。不仅能提高识字率，而且还提高了小学生的阅读能力，加速培养了儿童的读书习惯和写作能力。过去小学语文教学着重识字，不重视课外阅读。而且因为学生识字不足，一般的初小学生很难看书读报。看小人书也是看图不识字。现在一年级就能教学写话，写简单的日记，二年级的学生就学会查字典，写百余字的短文，四年级的学生过去只能写二百字的短文，现在能写六百字的文章，而且还会写诗。我在临猗认识了一个四年级学生，十岁的小诗人何梦熊，他半年读了一百五十本书，一年里作诗一千五百首之多。我们当场出题他就作了七首诗，差不多一分钟就可以作一首，而且作的都很好。如小弟弟为题，他作的诗是：“我家有个小弟弟，睡到半夜笑迷迷，我问他笑什么，他说梦见毛主席”。万荣县还在幼儿园大班结合各种游戏活动，试教拼音字母，也得到成功。个别的中班儿童有学得极好的，例如荣河幼儿园的五岁幼儿吴健生，能用拼音字母拼写任何一句话，并能标上四声，写得一点不错。
    万荣县的经验多方面的显示了党的文字改革方针的正确性。说明注音识字，不仅是工农群众知识化的捷径，可以加速文化革命与技术革命的进程，为我国由社会主义向共产主义过渡创造极为有利的条件，而且为教学革命也提供了极为有力的依据，为我国的全日制学校、半日制学校，以及工农业余学校的学制、课程、教学内容、教学方法的革命开辟了新的途径。幼儿园大班，教会儿童拼音字母，小学六年制的语文教材内容，只用四年就可学完，这便为中、小学的学制改革和推广普通话奠定了良好的基础。工农业余教育的年限更可以大大缩短，顶多用四个月的时间就可以达到扫盲毕业的标准，一年的时间，就可以使业余高小的语文、算术教学任务胜利完成。所以推行注音识字是和全体人民的利益与加速社会主义建设事业有密切关系的重大问题。山西省在万荣县召开了现场会议后，省人民委员会及时发出了“关于推行利用拼音字母提高工农群众的文化科学知识水平和推广普通话的指示”，于是全省掀起了一个推行注音识字的高潮。我们晋南地委在今年1月召开各县第一书记流动现场会议后，也及时作出决定：“在全区迅速开展一个全民性的学习汉语拼音运动”。目前我区农民参加学习汉语拼音的已达一百一十四万人，超过了全区青壮年一百一十三万人的总数；青壮年识字人数已有一百万人，达到青壮年总数的89％，参加业余初等学校和业余初中学习的已达三十万人。一个全民学习汉语拼音的群众运动已经轰轰烈烈的开展起来了。
    现在存在的问题是：发展不平衡，注音课本和注音的通俗读物还很缺乏，不能及时满足群众的要求。但是，我们相信这些问题很快便可以解决，在党和毛主席的领导下，我们完全有决心有信心在1960年社会主义建设进入新阶段的总形势中，在推广万荣经验的基础上，把我省工农业余教育和群众的文化革命运动推进到崭新的大大跃进的新时期。
    以上发言不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
