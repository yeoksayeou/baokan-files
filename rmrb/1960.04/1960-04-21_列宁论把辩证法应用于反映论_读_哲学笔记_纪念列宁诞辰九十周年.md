    Lenin on Applying Dialectics to the Theory of Reflection
    Reading "Philosophical Notebooks"
    Commemorating the 90th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Sa Renxing
    Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the world's proletarian revolution, made great and outstanding contributions to Marxist philosophy in the course of leading the practical struggle of the proletarian revolution, developing it to a new stage. Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" comprehensively and profoundly developed materialist dialectics. For example, the ideas about the unity of opposites being the core of dialectics, the sixteen elements of dialectics, the consistency of logic and history, the identity of logic, dialectics and epistemology, and the application of dialectics to the theory of reflection, etc., are all major new contributions. This work is a model of creatively developing materialist dialectics, a model of combatting and criticizing bourgeois philosophy; and it puts forward a program for further studying Marxist philosophy. To this day, it remains radiant, an inexhaustible source of wisdom for us, and a sharp weapon for us to fight against modern revisionism and modern bourgeois philosophy.
    The "Philosophical Notebooks" is permeated with an important central idea, namely: to further apply dialectics to the theory of reflection and integrate Marxist dialectics and epistemology. Lenin said: Logic, dialectics, and the materialist theory of knowledge are "the same thing." That is to say, logic (dialectical logic) is the reflection of objective dialectics, i.e., the method of thinking; therefore, logic, dialectics as a method of cognition, and the Marxist theory of knowledge are the same thing. Precisely from this aspect of dialectics as a method of cognition, he also said: "Dialectics is also...Marxist epistemology." The formulations that logic, dialectics, and epistemology are "the same thing" and that "dialectics is also...Marxist epistemology" embody the idea of applying dialectics to the theory of reflection and integrating dialectics and materialist epistemology. This is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes the dialectical materialist theory of reflection from the metaphysical materialist theory of reflection. Starting from this fundamental viewpoint, Lenin used dialectics to further and more profoundly explain the dialectical process of thinking reflecting existence, and made extremely profound explorations into all aspects of the dialectics of cognition.
    Defending Marxist Philosophy, Opposing the Separation of Dialectics and Epistemology
    Lenin's special emphasis on the integration of Marxist dialectics and epistemology and the application of dialectics to the theory of reflection was not accidental. This was a central issue in defending and developing Marxist philosophy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time, on the one hand, bourgeois philosophers and revisionists (such as Bernstein who proposed "back to Kant" and the Russian Machists) launched a frantic attack on Marxist philosophy with epistemology as the center; on the other hand, within the ranks of Marxists, there was a serious tendency to regress towards metaphysics due to the separation of dialectics and epistemology. They were not only unable to effectively combat idealism and revisionism, but also, if this fundamental defect was not overcome, they would waver towards idealism and revisionism. Therefore, in order to defend Marxist philosophy, it was necessary to emphasize the integration of dialectics and epistemology, and it was necessary to further apply dialectics to the theory of reflection and develop Marxist epistemology with the development of revolutionary practice. Only in this way could Marxists be further armed, could wavering elements be strengthened, and could all kinds of idealist and revisionist attacks on Marxist philosophy be thoroughly shattered.
    The famous short essay "On the Question of Dialectics" in "Philosophical Notebooks" first profoundly reveals the essentials of dialectics, and then emphasizes and profoundly discusses the principle of applying dialectics to the theory of reflection. Lenin pointed out sharply: "The fundamental defect of metaphysical materialism is its inability to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection, to the process and development of cognition." Whether or not to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection is a fundamental dividing line between dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism. Because failure to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection can only result in a passive, intuitive theory of reflection, rather than a revolutionary, active theory of reflection.
    Marx and Engels overcame the fundamental defect of metaphysical materialism, introduced practice into epistemology as the basis of cognition, applied dialectics to the theory of reflection, and created the scientific dialectical materialist epistemology. However, after Engels' death, some Marxists did not know how to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection and forcibly separated Marxist dialectics from its epistemology. Although they talked a lot about the dialectics of existence on the one hand (of course, they only regarded dialectics "as a sum of examples" without understanding its essence), on the other hand, they stood on the position of the intuitive and passive theory of reflection of metaphysical materialism in epistemology. They could not apply dialectics to the theory of reflection, so they could not adhere to thorough materialism, and they would lose their footing and fall into idealism in many links of the cognitive process. They could not stand firm in the face of the bourgeois idealist and revisionist offensive against Marxist philosophy with epistemology as the center, and there was a great danger of wavering and compromise.
    Plekhanov, who had written some valuable philosophical works and also some essays criticizing the Second International revisionist Bernstein, separated dialectics and epistemology and did not know how to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection. This fundamental weakness caused him to waver in his entire philosophical stance and eventually fall into the quagmire of Menshevism. When criticizing Plekhanov, Lenin wrote: "Dialectics is also (Hegel and) Marxist epistemology: it is precisely this 'aspect' of the problem (this is not an 'aspect' of the problem, but the essence of the problem) that Plekhanov did not pay attention to, let alone other Marxists." The words "(Hegel and)" that Lenin wrote in parentheses clearly indicate that in Hegel, idealist dialectics, logic, and idealist epistemology were integrated on the basis of idealism; in Marxism, materialist dialectics, dialectical logic, and materialist epistemology are integrated on the basis of materialism. In this passage, the principle that Lenin pointed out, namely, applying dialectics to the theory of reflection and that "dialectics is also...Marxist epistemology," is of extremely important significance. It is the "essence of the problem." At the same time, it also points out that within the ranks of Marxists in the Second International after Engels' death, the separation of dialectics and epistemology had formed a trend of thought, so that even Marxists like Plekhanov could not avoid it.
    Lenin wrote in "Abstract of Hegel's 'Lectures on the History of Philosophy'": "Study: Plekhanov wrote about nearly a thousand pages on philosophy (dialectics) (Beltov + against Bogdanov + against Kantians + basic issues, etc.). Among them, there is not a word about the Great Logic, about it, its ideas (i.e., dialectics itself as a philosophical science)!!" The works of Plekhanov that Lenin mentioned here are all his early works, namely: "The Development of the Monist View of History" (this book was published under the pseudonym Beltov), essays against Bogdanov, essays against the revisionists Bernstein and Schmidt who wanted to "return to Kant," and "Fundamental Problems of Marxism." These works are basically Marxist, and Lenin also gave a high evaluation to "The Development of the Monist View of History." However, it was in these works that Lenin discovered Plekhanov's fundamental defect. Plekhanov's nearly one thousand pages of works did not mention dialectical logic "a word." He talked about dialectics on the one hand, but did not understand the dialectics of cognition, the dialectics of thought, which is precisely what refers to Plekhanov's separation of Marxist dialectics from Marxist epistemology.
    This fundamental defect of Plekhanov caused him to waver in the direction of departing from dialectical materialism and towards idealism, agnosticism, and mechanism. For example: (1) He turned to the metaphysical materialist view that all matter has spirit. (2) He confused Marxist epistemology with Feuerbach's epistemology, saying, "Marx's epistemology is honestly Feuerbach's epistemology, but the latter is deepened because Marx made a genius revision." ("Fundamental Problems of Marxism") He did not understand the profound and essential difference between metaphysical reflectionism and dialectical reflectionism. He neither understood the identity of dialectics and epistemology, nor the fundamental difference between Marx's view of practice and Feuerbach's view of practice. He even said: "It is wrong for Marx to accuse Feuerbach of not understanding 'practical critical' activity. Feuerbach understood it." ("From Idealism to Materialism") In fact, the "practice" that Feuerbach understood was only the activities of individual daily life, which is fundamentally different from the revolutionary social practice that Marx spoke of. (3) He wrote some essays criticizing neo-Kantianism, which not only failed to effectively refute dualism and agnosticism, but also introduced the hieroglyphic theory into epistemology and wavered towards Kantianism and agnosticism. As everyone knows, Lenin made a profound criticism of Plekhanov's hieroglyphic theory in his book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." In addition, Lenin also pointed out in "Notebooks": "Plekhanov's criticism of Kantianism (and agnosticism in general) mostly proceeds from the viewpoint of vulgar materialism, and rarely from the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, because he only refutes their arguments without correcting them... these arguments, without deepening, generalizing, expanding them, without pointing out the connection and transformation of all and any concepts." It is impossible to refute Kantianism and agnosticism from the viewpoint of metaphysics. The reason for Plekhanov's weak criticism of Kantianism and agnosticism that Lenin pointed out is that he cannot use the dialectics of the cognitive process and the dialectics of thinking to criticize. In short, his inability to criticize Kantianism and his own wavering towards agnosticism are inseparable from the separation of dialectics and epistemology and the inability to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection.
    Lenin also pointed out: "Marxists (in the early twentieth century) mostly criticized Kantians and Humeans based on Feuerbach's viewpoint (and based on Büchner's viewpoint)." It can be seen that Lenin believed that the regression towards Feuerbach (and Büchner) due to the inability to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection was not an accidental phenomenon, but a serious tendency and trend of thought among the Marxists in the early twentieth century.
    In "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin conducted practical research based on the principle that "dialectics is also...Marxist epistemology" and applying dialectics to the theory of reflection. In the form of "aphorisms," annotations, and short discussions, he wrote down many valuable and brilliant ideas. Below, based on our study and understanding, we will discuss these ideas from several main aspects; and thereby analyze which links one would fall into idealism in if one does not apply dialectics to the theory of reflection. From this analysis, we can further see the importance of applying dialectics to the theory of reflection for defending and developing Marxist philosophy and for fighting against idealism and revisionism. These are still of great practical significance today.
    Dialectical Unity of Thinking and Existence, Subjective and Objective on the Basis of Practice
    Applying dialectics to the theory of reflection first means applying dialectics, especially its core, the unity of opposites, to the relationship between thinking and existence, subjective and objective, theory and practice.
    We know that materialism before Marx did not understand the dependence of cognition on practice, did not understand the significance of "practical critical" activity, did not understand the significance of revolutionary activity, and did not understand the active aspect of people. It only understood thinking's reflection of existence from a passive and negative perspective. As Marx said, at that time, "the active aspect was developed abstractly by idealism, in opposition to materialism – which, of course, does not know real, sensuous activity as such." ("Theses on Feuerbach") Marxism solves the relationship between thinking and existence with the theory of reflection, that is, it admits that thinking is a reflection of existence; but at the same time, it solves the relationship between thinking and existence with dialectics, that is, it believes that thinking's reflection of existence is not a passive and negative reflection, but an active and dynamic reflection. Of course, reflection has a passive side, that is, objective things stimulate people's sensory organs and cause feelings and thoughts; but this passivity is based on activity, that is, people obtain rich sensory materials in the practical struggle of constantly and actively transforming the objective world, and actively rise to rational cognition, and rational cognition can actively guide practice and react on objective existence. That is to say, the relationship between primary existence and secondary thinking is dialectical.
    In "Notebooks," Lenin emphasized that practice is higher than cognition, analyzed the role of practice in cognition, and pointed out that people "go to objective truth through practice (and technology)," "Nature is reflected in man's thought. In his practice, in technology, he proves the correctness of these reflections, and thereby approaches objective truth." From this, Lenin further developed the dialectical unity of thinking and existence, subjective and objective on the basis of practice.
    In Hegel, the relationship between thinking and existence is solved idealistically, but his system contains a rational kernel of dialectics. On the one hand, Lenin severely criticized Hegel's idealism; on the other hand, he paid attention to the valuable things in Hegel's dialectics. As he himself said, he "always strove to read Hegel's works from a materialist viewpoint," that is, "largely discarded God, the Absolute, pure Idea, etc.," and gave Hegel's dialectics a materialist transformation. Regarding this aspect, there are many profound and valuable thoughts in "Notebooks." Here, we will particularly focus on Lenin's application of the law of the unity of opposites to the relationship between thinking and existence, thereby developing the active and revolutionary theory of reflection.
    We know that Lenin stipulated the mutual transformation of mutually contradictory opposites under certain conditions as an important content of the law of the unity of opposites. Then, applying the law of the unity of opposites to the relationship between thinking and existence means not only admitting that consciousness is transformed from existence and that subjective things are a reflection of objective things, but also further admitting on this basis that consciousness has a reactive effect on existence, and that under certain conditions, subjective things can be transformed into objective things. In "Notebooks," Lenin focused on developing this idea.
    There is a passage in the abstract of Hegel's "Science of Logic": "One is the ancient principle of atoms (and void)," "The ideality of self-existent being as totality becomes reality, becomes the most solid and abstract reality like one." Lenin excerpted these words and annotated: "Inscrutable..." Then he annotated: "The idea of the transformation of the ideal into the real is profound: it is very important for history." Obviously, "inscrutable" is to oppose and satirize Hegel, because the "idea of self-existent being as totality" that Hegel spoke of is his absolute idea, and the idea of the ideal becoming the real that he spoke of is that the absolute idea created the most primitive matter, that is, the so-called "otherness" and externalization of the absolute idea into nature, which is of course absurd. As Engels pointed out in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," this is a creation story that is even more chaotic and absurd than in Christianity. The second annotation critically absorbed the rational kernel of Hegel's dialectics and developed it materialistically. In Lenin's view, the "transformation of the ideal into the real" of course refers to the idea of man as a reflection of existence, which is transformed into the real thing through practice under certain conditions, that is, subjective things become objective things. Lenin also specifically pointed out that this viewpoint is "very important for history." Because history is the history of people consciously transforming the objective world with labor, and the transformation of the objective world is also the transformation of consciousness as a reflection of existence into objective reality through practice. If one fundamentally denies that the ideal can be transformed into the objective, then human history becomes incomprehensible. It is also for this reason that metaphysical materialists can basically adhere to the materialist viewpoint in the natural field (where there is no conscious activity to transform the world, and animals only passively adapt to the environment), but they cannot help but fall into idealism in the historical field, either admitting that social consciousness determines social existence, or denying the subjective initiative of people, and falling into historical idealism through mechanism and fatalism.
    Lenin wrote elsewhere: "Man's consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates the objective world," which is consistent with the proposition of "the transformation of the ideal into the real," and is also a logical further development of Marx's idea that theory becomes a material force once it has grasped the masses. "Man's consciousness reflects the objective world" is a general materialist proposition. Metaphysical materialism only goes this far. In contrast to metaphysical materialism, dialectical materialism not only admits that consciousness reflects the objective world, but also admits on this basis that "consciousness creates the objective world" (of course, not referring to creating matter, which can neither be created nor destroyed, but referring to changing the form of existence of matter). Of course, first of all, consciousness is a reflection of objective existence, as Lenin said: "Man's purpose is produced by the objective world and presupposes it"; secondly, it creates the objective world through practice, and the ability to achieve the effect of transforming the objective world is to use objective laws rather than violate them. As Lenin said: "The laws of the external world and nature...are the basis of man's purposeful activity." This is a fundamental dividing line between dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism in solving the problem of the relationship between thinking and existence.
    Admitting that the idea of existence as a reflection can be transformed into the real thing under certain conditions, and admitting that "consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates the objective world" is to thoroughly admit the dialectics of thinking and existence and thoroughly apply the law of the unity of opposites to the relationship between thinking and existence. In this way, it further clarifies and develops the active and revolutionary theory of reflection. Whoever denies the dialectics of thinking and existence, and denies applying the law of the unity of opposites to the relationship between thinking and existence, fundamentally departs from the dialectical theory of reflection and the active and revolutionary theory of reflection, and therefore cannot adhere to the basic materialist principle that thinking is a reflection of existence. Lenin paid special attention to this issue because, theoretically, it is a major principle issue of dialectical materialist epistemology, and practically, it is a major principle that is particularly needed to be defended and developed in actual struggle.
    The above-mentioned ideas of Lenin are of course not written down by him accidentally. Not only does he develop this idea in many places in "Notebooks," but also from his works that fought against all kinds of opportunism, we can see this brilliant idea and its organic connection with the actual revolutionary struggle. Lenin has a famous principle: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," "Only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of advanced fighters." Obviously, this is consistent with fully admitting the active role of consciousness and with the philosophical view that "man's consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates the objective world." We know that the famous principle that "without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement" was put forward by Lenin in the struggle against opportunism and economism. Economists deny the role of theory and advanced elements, worship spontaneity, that is, they want to limit the workers' movement to the scope of not touching the capitalist system and oppose the workers from carrying out political struggles to overthrow the bourgeois regime. Bernstein, the traitor of the working class and revisionist, put forward a notorious slogan at that time: "The movement is everything, and the goal is nothing," which is to prevent workers from carrying out political struggles to seize power from the bourgeoisie in order to realize communism. The revisionists of the Second International all advocated "the theory of productive forces" in social theory, that is, they denied the reactive effect of production relations on productive forces and the reactive effect of the superstructure on the economic base, and believed that social development was simply and directly determined by production technology, and nonsensically said that when "productive forces" developed to a certain degree, capitalism would "automatically" and "peacefully" grow into socialism. This group of people all "revised" historical materialism with mechanism and the theory of productive forces. Their purpose was to oppose the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat and to serve the bourgeoisie. The philosophical basis of all these absurd theories is the denial of the active role of consciousness. Lenin emphasized and profoundly developed the dialectics of thinking and existence, and emphasized and profoundly developed the principle of the conscious activity of materialist dialectics, precisely in order to shatter the philosophical basis of revisionist fallacies; and emphasizing and profoundly developing this point is also very necessary to strengthen the wavering Marxists.
    Today, modern revisionists, under new historical conditions and in order to meet the needs of imperialism, continue to make mechanistic revisions to historical materialism. The basis of their social theory is still "the theory of productive forces," repeating the deceptive fallacy of "capitalism peacefully growing into socialism." Therefore, we must also insist on applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, and we must profoundly develop the dialectics of thinking and existence and the principle of the active role of consciousness. This is of great significance for criticizing modern revisionism.
    The Dialectics of the Cognitive Process
    Applying dialectics to the theory of reflection is also manifested in using dialectics, especially its core, the law of the unity of opposites, to explain the human cognitive process and the dialectics of the cognitive process, and the dialectics of the leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge on the basis of practice. In this respect, Lenin also developed many valuable and brilliant ideas in "Notebooks."
    We know that both dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism admit that the world is knowable, and both admit it from the standpoint of the theory of reflection. However, there is a fundamental difference in principle between the two: the former believes that cognition is an infinite process full of contradictions, and the agreement between cognition and the objective is relative and conditional; while the latter, on the contrary, regards the cognition of the objective world as something that can be achieved all at once, and regards the agreement between the subjective and the objective as absolute and rigid. This is the fundamental difference between dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism on the knowability of the world. Without applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, without understanding the relationship between cognition and practice in a dialectical materialist way, one cannot understand the complexity of the cognitive process and the dialectics of the leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge; therefore, one cannot have a dialectical materialist understanding of the knowability of the world; of course, one cannot vigorously combat Kantian agnosticism in this way. Moreover, the metaphysical view of the knowability of the world, under certain conditions, can also be transformed into agnosticism.
    Lenin wrote: "Kant tore knowledge away from the object and thereby considered the limited, temporary, relative, and conditional nature of human knowledge (its categories, causality, etc.) as subjectivism, and not as the dialectics of the idea (= nature itself)." This is an incisive, most concise, and most accurate criticism of Kantianism from dialectical materialism and from the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge.
    Although metaphysical materialism advocates the knowability of the world, it denies the relativity of knowledge and does not see the complexity of the cognitive process. It believes that knowledge of the objective world can be achieved all at once or even only through sensation. In this way, it is of course impossible for metaphysical materialism to thoroughly refute agnosticism theoretically. Because denying "the limited, temporary, relative, and conditional nature of human knowledge (its categories, causality, etc.)" will lead to the following errors: (1) Regarding the knowledge that has been achieved as the absolute truth that is "perfect and cannot be added to," making thought rigid and unwilling to develop concepts, categories, and principles with the development of practice. In this way, one will insist on making the already developed objective reality conform to the ideas that were originally formed in one's mind, and in practice, one will commit idealist errors. (2) One may also waver towards agnosticism under certain conditions. For example, when they see that people have made some unavoidable mistakes in the cognitive process, they do not understand that this is the dialectics of the cognitive process, but exaggerate it and attribute it all to subjectivism. This is also like Kant, who regards the relative, conditional, and temporary nature of knowledge as subjectivism. Those who hold this view, when they adhere to metaphysical knowability, require absolute conformity between knowledge and the objective on every specific issue; and when they find that this is impossible, according to consistent logic, they will inevitably be transformed into agnostics.
    Metaphysical materialism regards the reflection of thinking on existence as intuitive. The old materialism, known for its theory of sensation, only recognizes that perceptual knowledge is reliable, while denying or belittling rational knowledge, or admitting rational knowledge but denying its qualitative difference from perceptual knowledge. This is the inevitable result of "not applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, to the cognitive process and development." In "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin attaches great importance to the dialectics of perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge, and talks about the active leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge and the formation process and complexity of concepts, judgments, and inferences in many places. Lenin wrote: "Cognition is the reflection of nature by man. But this reflection is not simple, not immediate, not complete, but a series of abstractions, the formation of concepts, laws, etc. These concepts, laws, etc.... conditionally and approximately grasp the universal regularity of eternally moving and developing nature." When people's cognition stagnates at the stage of perceptual knowledge, they cannot grasp the regularity of the world's movement. Rising from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge is a series of abstract processes. If one does not adhere to dialectical materialism in this process, one will eventually fall into idealism. Lenin wrote: "The mirroring of a thing in human consciousness is not a simple, immediate, unalterable act, it is an act which consists of a chain of transformations; but, as a result, knowledge can represent an idea, concept (which is the true expression of the objective essence of the world), not the reality itself. The idealisation, or the generalisation of the results of knowledge, is the result not only of observation, but also of the active part taken by knowledge in the study of facts. However, it is in this process of idealisation, of generalisation that the possibility of turning a true reflection into a false one, of transforming scientific knowledge into a superstition." The possibility of idealism "already exists in the first, most simple abstraction." In the article "On the Question of Dialectics," Lenin further analyzed the epistemological roots of idealism. Lenin's analysis not only gave us a powerful weapon against idealism and to expose its absurdity from its epistemological roots, but also proved to us the importance of applying dialectics to the theory of reflection, that is, studying the dialectics of thinking, the dialectical logic that is the reflection of objective dialectics, and using it as a guide to process sensory materials in order to ensure that one does not go astray in the process of thinking and abstraction and fall into idealism. This is an important reason why Lenin attached special importance to the study of dialectical logic.
    The Dialectics of the Concreteness and Universality of Truth
    On the issue of the theory of truth, applying dialectics to the theory of reflection means clarifying the dialectics of relative truth and absolute truth, the dialectics of the absoluteness and relativity of the criterion of knowledge (social practice), and the dialectics of the concreteness and universality of truth on the basis of admitting objective truth. Lenin made profound elucidations on the former two in the book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." We know that if we do not apply dialectics to the theory of reflection and clarify the dialectics of absolute truth and relative truth and the dialectics of the absoluteness and relativity of the criterion of practice, we will fall into absolutism or relativism, and from this point, it is possible to completely depart from the position of dialectical materialism. In "Notebooks," Lenin seems to have focused more on the dialectics of the concreteness and universality of truth. Here, we will focus on discussing this issue.
    As everyone knows, Lenin believed that "there is no abstract truth; truth is always concrete." How should this principle be understood? There may be two kinds of understanding: one is a dialectical understanding, where the concreteness of truth does not exclude its universality; the other is an understanding of the old materialist theory of sensation, where one only believes in the concreteness of truth and does not believe in the universality of truth, and opposes the two, which leads to the road of denying universal truth.
    Lenin said: "Truth is comprehensive," "Truth is made up of the sum total of all aspects of the phenomenon, reality, and their (mutual) relations." After excerpting the passage in Hegel's "Science of Logic" that "not only abstract universality, but also the universality that embodies the richness of special things in itself," Lenin annotated: "Wonderful formula: not only abstract universality, but also this universality that embodies the richness of special, individual, and particular things...Excellent!" Of course, Lenin's principled stance is fundamentally opposite to Hegel's. Clearly, Lenin's annotation is to give Hegel's viewpoint a materialist transformation and development of the rational elements. The concrete concepts and concrete truths obtained by people rising from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge on the basis of practice and through scientific abstraction are the universality that embodies the richness of special, individual, and particular things; it is both concrete and universal. The "abstract" in "there is no abstract truth" refers to the empty and formal abstraction that does not embody the richness of special, individual, and particular things, not the scientific abstraction. Lenin expressed this idea in several places in "Notebooks."
    The above explanation can also be confirmed by Marx's argument on the same issue. Marx pointed out in "Critique of Political Economy": "Population" is a real and concrete thing. It is the organic link between many regulations and many factors, he said: "If I leave aside the classes, for example, of which the population consists, the population is an abstraction. If I do not know the factors on which these classes rest, such as wage labour, capital, etc., the classes are again an empty phrase..." (Emphasis added by the translator) Therefore, Marx said: "The concrete is concrete, because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse."
    The so-called "truth is concrete" in dialectical materialism does not mean that it is the sensory intuition of individual things, but that it profoundly reflects the inherent essential connection of special and individual things and processes. The concreteness of truth means that theory must be linked to practice, and when applying general principles to solve specific problems, it must be combined with the specific. Because the truth is concrete, it is universal; because it is universal, it is concrete. This is the dialectics of the concreteness and universality of truth.
    However, if one adheres to the old materialist theory of sensation and understands the principle of "there is no abstract truth; truth is always concrete" in an empiricist way, it will lead to the denial of scientific abstraction and the denial of universal truth, and one will understand truth as the truth of this time and place. In that way, one cannot clearly draw a line with pragmatism on the issue of truth.
    Modern bourgeois philosophy and revisionism both oppose Marxism by denying the universality of truth. The pragmatist Hu Shih nonsensically said that truth is a man-made tool for dealing with the environment, and thus asserted that universal truth is "suspended in the air" and "abstract." He said: Truth "is the truth of this time, this situation, and this me." Modern revisionists exaggerate the particular, deny the universal laws of the socialist revolution, deny the universality of truth, and equate the Marxist theory of truth with pragmatism. For example, the Yugoslav revisionist Marković shamelessly revised the Marxist theory of truth with pragmatism. He deliberately confused right and wrong, and said that Dewey's theory of truth is the same as Marx's theory of truth. He said: Dewey's theory of truth "was already argued by Marx half a century before Dewey." It can be seen that, in order to crush the modern revisionist fallacy of denying universal truth, we must apply dialectics to the theory of reflection and use the dialectics of the universality and concreteness of truth to fight against it. In order to consolidate and improve our own ranks, we must also clarify and publicize the dialectics of the universality and concreteness of truth and criticize the tendency of the old materialist theory of sensation.
    Instructions on the Study of Dialectical Logic
    Another important aspect of applying dialectics to the theory of reflection is clarifying the dialectics of thinking, that is, dialectical logic. Of course, the dialectics of thinking is the reflection of objective dialectics, but the dialectical logic that consciously guides people's theoretical thinking must clarify the dialectical movement of concepts, judgments, and inferences. Lenin attached great importance to this issue in "Notebooks."
    It can also be said that Lenin's research on dialectics in "Notebooks" is a research on dialectical logic. In this respect, there are many brilliant ideas in "Notebooks." Lenin gave a scientific definition of dialectical logic for the first time. He said: "Logic is not the doctrine of external forms of thought, but the doctrine of the laws of development of all material, natural and spiritual things, that is, the doctrine of the laws of development of the entire concrete content of the world and its cognition. In other words, logic is the historical summary, the sum, and the conclusion of the cognition of the world." This definition not only reveals the essence of dialectical logic, but also points out the specific path for studying dialectical logic, points out the significance of studying the history of human cognition for developing dialectical logic, and also points out the purpose and direction of studying the history of various kinds of cognition. Lenin also pointed out the main content of dialectical logic. He wrote: "The relation of concepts (= transformation = contradiction) = the main content of logic, and these concepts (and their relations, transformations, contradictions) are expressed as a reflection of the objective world. The dialectics of things creates the dialectics of ideas, not the other way around." He also said: "What is dialectics (according to the following, it is clearly referring to dialectical logic here - translator's note)? The interdependence of concepts - the interdependence of all concepts without exception; the transformation of one concept into another - the transformation of all concepts without exception. The relativity of the opposition between concepts...The identity of the opposites between concepts. Note that each concept is in a certain relationship, a certain connection, with all other concepts." In short, Lenin meant that dialectical logic is to reveal the connection, dependence, and transformation between concepts, and the contradiction and identity of opposites between concepts; people's concepts and judgments and inferences composed of concepts should not be rigid and unconnected, but "should be flexible, active, relative, interconnected, and unified in opposition in order to grasp the world," because the objective world is originally a unity of opposites, the contradictory movement of matter. Indeed, this is the main content of dialectical logic, and it is an outline for studying dialectical logic.
    Lenin also raised the issue of studying dialectical logic in "Notebooks." Roughly speaking, the main ones are: (1) Studying the history of cognition dialectically. This is very important for establishing the system of dialectical logic, because dialectical logic is the generalization, summary, and essence of the history of cognition, and the logical is consistent with the historical. (2) Studying the dialectical logic of "Capital." Lenin said: "Although Marx did not leave behind 'Logic' (capital letter), he did leave behind the logic of 'Capital,' and this logic should be fully utilized to solve current problems." In the article "On the Significance of Militant Materialism," Lenin raised this task again. Lenin's instruction is of course still applicable to our study of dialectical logic today; but we should also study the dialectical logic in Lenin's works and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, whose works are also models of applying dialectics to the thinking process and to concepts, judgments, and inferences. (3) In addition, Lenin also put forward the task of critically studying Hegel's works. He also raised this task again in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism." Of course, one cannot imagine picking ready-made things from Hegel's "Science of Logic," but must give it a thorough criticism. On this point, Lenin wrote in "Notebooks": "Hegel's logic cannot be applied unchanged; it cannot be moved here ready-made. To select the logical (epistemological) components from it and remove its mystical ideas is still a huge task." Because we have Lenin's model of "reading Hegel's works from a materialist viewpoint," especially with his very detailed summaries and annotations, we should say that our study of Hegel's works is relatively easy to achieve results. Currently, dialectical logic is still the weakest department in our philosophical research work. We should follow Lenin's instructions and strengthen this aspect of research in combination with the practice of socialist construction in our country. This research is of great significance for improving the ideological methods of our cadres and for more sharply and profoundly criticizing bourgeois philosophy and modern revisionism from an epistemological point of view.

    列宁论把辩证法应用于反映论
    读“哲学笔记”
    纪念列宁诞辰九十周年
    撒仁兴
    全世界无产阶级革命的伟大领袖和导师列宁，在领导无产阶级革命的实践斗争中，对马克思主义哲学作出了伟大、卓越的贡献，把它发展到了一个新的阶段。列宁的《哲学笔记》全面地深刻地发展了唯物主义辩证法，例如，关于对立面的统一是辩证法的核心，辩证法的十六要素，关于逻辑和历史的一致，逻辑、辩证法和认识论的同一、把辩证法应用于反映论，等等思想，都是重大的新的贡献。这部著作是创造性地发展唯物主义辩证法的典范，战斗地批判资产阶级哲学的典范；并且提出了如何进一步研究马克思主义哲学的纲领。直到今天，它仍然光辉灿烂，是我们取之不尽、用之不竭的智慧的源泉，是我们同现代修正主义、同现代资产阶级哲学作斗争的锐利武器。
    《哲学笔记》贯串着一个重要的中心思想，即：进一步把辩证法应用于反映论，把马克思主义的辩证法和认识论溶为一体。列宁说：逻辑、辩证法和唯物主义的认识论“是同一个东西”。这就是说，逻辑（辩证逻辑）是客观辩证法的反映、即思想方法；所以逻辑、作为认识方法的辩证法和马克思主义的认识论是同一个东西。正是从辩证法作为认识方法的这一方面，他又说：“辩证法也就是……马克思主义的认识论。”逻辑、辩证法和认识论“是同一个东西”、“辩证法也就是……马克思主义的认识论”，这两个提法，正是体现了把辩证法应用于反映论、把辩证法和唯物主义的认识论溶为一体的思想。而这一点，正是辩证唯物主义的反映论和形而上学唯物主义反映论相区别的根本特点。列宁从这个根本观点出发，运用辩证法更进一步、更深刻地阐明了思维反映存在的辩证过程，对认识的辩证法的各个方面，作了极其深刻的探讨。
    保卫马克思主义哲学，反对割裂辩证法和认识论
    列宁特别强调马克思主义的辩证法和认识论溶为一体，把辩证法应用于反映论，并不是偶然的。这是十九世纪末和二十世纪初保卫和发展马克思主义哲学的一个中心问题。当时，一方面，资产阶级哲学家和修正主义者（例如提出“回到康德去”的伯恩斯坦以及俄国的马赫主义者）都以认识论为中心对马克思主义哲学展开了疯狂的攻击；另一面，在马克思主义的队伍中间，发生了由于割裂辩证法和认识论而向着形而上学倒退的严重倾向，他们不仅不能对唯心主义和修正主义进行有力的战斗，而且如不克服这个根本缺陷，他们还会向着唯心主义和修正主义动摇。因此，为了保卫马克思主义哲学，就必须强调辩证法和认识论溶为一体，就必须随着革命实践的发展，把辩证法进一步应用于反映论，发展马克思主义的认识论。只有这样，才能够进一步武装马克思主义者，才能够使不坚定的分子坚定起来，才能够彻底粉碎各色各样的唯心主义、修正主义对马克思主义哲学的攻击。
    《哲学笔记》中的《谈谈辩证法问题》这篇著名的短文，首先深刻地揭明了辩证法的要点，紧接着就强调和深刻论述了把辩证法应用于反映论的原理。列宁一针见血地指出：“形而上学的唯物主义的根本缺陷就是不能把辩证法应用于反映论，应用于认识的过程和发展。”是否把辩证法应用于反映论，这是辩证唯物主义和形而上学唯物主义的一个根本分界线。因为不能把辩证法应用于反映论，就只能是消极的直观的反映论，而不能是革命的能动的反映论。
    马克思和恩格斯克服了形而上学唯物主义的根本缺陷，把实践引到认识论中来作为认识的基础，把辩证法应用于反映论，创立了科学的辩证唯物主义的认识论。但是，在恩格斯逝世之后，有些马克思主义者却不知道把辩证法应用于反映论，硬是把马克思主义的辩证法和它的认识论分割开来，尽管一方面大讲存在的辩证法（当然，他们只是把辩证法“当做实例的总和”，而不了解它的本质），另一方面，却在认识论上站到了形而上学唯物主义的直观、消极的反映论立场。他们不能把辩证法应用于反映论，因此就不能坚持彻底的唯物主义，就会在认识过程的许多环节上失足陷入唯心主义；他们在资产阶级唯心主义和修正主义以认识论为中心向马克思主义哲学的进攻面前，就不能站稳脚跟，就有动摇妥协的极大危险。
    曾经写过一些很有价值的哲学著作、也写过一些批判第二国际修正主义者伯恩斯坦的论文的普列汉诺夫，就是割裂了辩证法和认识论，不知道把辩证法应用于反映论。这个根本弱点，使得他后来在整个哲学立场上发生了动摇，以至终于滚到了孟什维克的泥坑。列宁批评普列汉诺夫时写道：“辩证法也就是（黑格尔和）马克思主义的认识论：正是问题的这一‘方面’（这不是问题的一‘方面’，而是问题的本质）普列汉诺夫不曾加以注意，至于其他的马克思主义者就更不用说了。”列宁在括号里所写的“黑格尔和”这几个字，显然是表明：在黑格尔那里，唯心主义辩证法，逻辑学，也就是唯心主义的认识论，它们在唯心主义基础上溶为一体；在马克思主义这里则是，唯物主义辩证法、辩证逻辑，也就是唯物主义的认识论，它们在唯物主义基础上溶为一体。在这段话里，列宁指出的把辩证法应用于反映论、“辩证法也就是……马克思主义的认识论”这个原理，是有极重要的意义的，这是“问题的本质”；同时又指明了，在恩格斯逝世以后的第二国际的马克思主义队伍中间，割裂辩证法和认识论已经形成了一种思潮，以至连普列汉诺夫这样的马克思主义者也未能避免。
    列宁在《黑格尔‘哲学史讲演录’一书摘要》中写道：“研究一下：普列汉诺夫关于哲学（辩证法）大约写了近一千页的东西（别尔托夫＋反对波格丹诺夫＋反对康德主义者＋基本问题等等）。其中关于大逻辑，关于它、它的思想（即作为哲学科学的辩证法本身）却一字不提！！”列宁在这里提到的普列汉诺夫的著作，都是他的前期的著作，即：《论一元论历史观之发展》（这本书是以别尔托夫笔名发表的），反对波格丹诺夫的论文，反对要“回到康德去”的修正主义者伯恩斯坦、斯密特的论文和《马克思主义的基体问题》。这些著作基本上是马克思主义的，并且，列宁还对《论一元论历史观之发展》给予了很高的评价。但是，就是在这些著作中，列宁发现了普列汉诺夫的根本缺陷。普列汉诺夫的近一千页的著作，却对辩证逻辑“一字不提”，他一方面讲辩证法，一方面却不懂认识的辩证法、思维的辩证法，——这正是指的普列汉诺夫把马克思主义的辩证法和马克思主义的认识论割裂了开来。
    普列汉诺夫的这个根本缺陷，使得他向着离开辩证唯物主义的方向，向着唯心主义、不可知论和机械论动摇，例如：（一）他转到了形而上学唯物主义关于一切物质皆有精神的观点上去。（二）他把马克思主义认识论和费尔巴哈的认识论混同起来，他说，“马克思的认识论老实说也就是费尔巴哈的认识论，不过后者是因为马克思做了天才的修正而更加深刻化罢了。”（《马克思主义的基本问题》）他不懂得形而上学反映论和辩证法的反映论之深刻的本质的区别。他既不了解辩证法和认识论的同一，也不了解马克思的实践观和费尔巴哈的实践观的根本区别，他竟说：“马克思指责费尔巴哈不了解‘实践批判’活动，这是不对的。费尔巴哈是了解它的。”（《从唯心主义到唯物主义》）其实，费尔巴哈所了解的“实践”，只是个人的日常生活的活动，和马克思所说的革命的社会实践是根本不同的。（三）他写了一些批判新康德主义的论文，不但不能有力地驳斥二元论和不可知论，而且把象形文字论带进了认识论，而向着康德主义、不可知论动摇。大家知道，列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》一书中，对普列汉诺夫的象形文字论，作了深刻的批评。此外，列宁在《笔记》中还指出：“普列汉诺夫批判康德主义（以及一般不可知论）多半是从庸俗唯物主义的观点出发，而很少从辩证唯物主义观点出发，因为他只是不痛不痒地驳斥它们的议论，而没有纠正……这些议论，没有加深、概括、扩大它们，没有指出一切的和任何的概念的联系和转化。”以形而上学的观点是驳不倒康德主义、不可知论的。列宁所指出的普列汉诺夫批判康德主义、不可知论的软弱无力，其原因就是不能用认识过程的辩证法、思维的辩证法去批判。总之，他对康德主义批判的无力，和他自己向着不可知论动摇，都是同割裂辩证法和认识论、不能把辩证法应用于反映论分不开的。
    列宁还指出：“马克思主义者（在二十世纪初）批判康德主义者和休谟主义者多半是根据费尔巴哈的观点（和根据毕希纳的观点）”。可见，列宁认为，由于不能把辩证法应用于反映论，而向着费尔巴哈（以及毕希纳）倒退，并不是一个偶然的现象；而是在二十世纪初马克思主义队伍中的一种严重的倾向和思潮。
    列宁在《哲学笔记》中，根据“辩证法也就是……马克思主义的认识论”、把辩证法应用于反映论的原理，进行了切实的研究，他以“警言”、批语、简短的议论的形式，写下了许多宝贵的天才的思想。下面，就我们的学习和体会，从几个主要方面谈谈这些思想；并从而分析一下，如果不把辩证法应用于反映论，就会在那些环节上陷入唯心主义。从这种分析中，我们可以进一步看出：把辩证法应用于反映论对于保卫和发展马克思主义哲学，对于同唯心主义、修正主义作斗争的重要性。这一些在今天仍然有着重大的现实意义。
    思维和存在、主观和客观在实践基础上的辩证统一
    把辩证法应用于反映论，首先就是把辩证法，特别是它的核心——对立面的统一，应用于思维和存在、主观和客观、理论和实践的关系上去。
    我们知道，马克思以前的唯物主义不了解认识对于实践的依赖关系，不了解“实践批判”活动的意义，不了解革命活动的意义，不了解人们的能动方面；对于思维之反映存在，只是从被动的消极的方面去理解。正如马克思所说：那时，“能动的方面竟是跟唯物主义相反的被唯心主义发展了，但只是被它抽象地发展了，因为唯心主义当然不知道有真正现实的活动。”（《费尔巴哈论纲》）马克思主义是以反映论解决思维和存在的关系的，即承认思维是存在的反映；但同时又是以辩证法解决思维和存在的关系的，即认为思维之反映存在不是被动的消极的反映，而是积极的能动的反映。固然，反映有受动的一面，即客观事物刺激人的感觉器官引起感觉，引起思想；但是这种受动是在能动基础上的受动，就是说，人们是在不断地能动地改造客观世界的实践斗争中，获得丰富的感觉材料，能动地上升到理性认识，理性认识又能动地指导实践，反作用于客观存在。这就是说，第一性的存在和第二性的思维，两者的关系是辩证的。
    列宁在《笔记》中强调了实践高于认识，分析了实践在认识中的作用，他指出：人们“经过实践（和技术）走向客观真理”，“自然界反映在人的头脑中。人在自己的实践中，在技术中检验这些反映的正确性并运用它们，从而也就接近客观真理”。由此，列宁进一步发挥了思维和存在、主观和客观在实践基础上的辩证统一。
    在黑格尔那里，思维和存在的关系是唯心主义地解决的，但在他的体系里却包含着辩证法的合理内核；列宁一方面严厉地批判了黑格尔的唯心主义，另一方面，又注意了黑格尔辩证法中有价值的东西。正如他自己所说，“总是竭力用唯物主义观点来读黑格尔的著作”，就是说“大抵抛弃神、绝对、纯粹观念等等”，而把黑格尔的辩证法加以唯物主义的改造。关于这一方面，《笔记》中有许多的深刻、宝贵的思想。这里，我们特别着重地谈一谈列宁把对立统一规律应用于思维和存在的关系、从而对能动的革命的反映论的发挥。
    我们知道：列宁把互相矛盾着的对立面在一定条件下的互相转化，规定为对立统一规律的一个重要内容。那末，把对立的统一规律应用于思维和存在的关系，就是不仅要承认意识由存在转化而来，主观的东西是客观的东西的反映，而且要在这个基础上进一步承认意识对于存在的反作用，在一定条件下主观的东西可以转化为客观的东西。在《笔记》中，列宁正是着重地发挥了这一思想。
    黑格尔《逻辑学》一书摘要中有这样一段话：“一是古老的原子（和虚空）的原则”，“作为总体的自为的存在的观念性变为实在，变为正像一那样的最牢固最抽象的实在。”列宁摘录了这些话，批道：“高深莫测……”，紧接着又批道：“观念的东西转化为实在的东西，这个思想是深刻的：对于历史是很重要的。”很显然，“高深莫测”，这是反对和讽刺黑格尔的，因为黑格尔所说的“作为总体的自为的存在的观念”，就是他的绝对观念，他所说的观念变为实在，即是绝对观念创造了最原始的物质，即是所谓绝对观念的“异在”、外化为自然界，这当然是荒诞的。正如恩格斯在《费尔巴哈论》中所指出的：这是一种比在基督教那里更加混乱而荒唐的创世说。而第二段批语，批判地吸收了黑格尔辩证法的合理内核，并加以唯物主义的发挥。“观念的东西转化为实在的东西”，在列宁这里，当然是指的，作为存在之反映的人的观念，在一定条件下通过实践转化为实在的东西，即主观的东西变成客观的东西。列宁还特别指出：这个观点，“对于历史是很重要的”。因为，历史是人们有意识地用劳动改造客观世界的历史，客观世界的被改造，也就是作为存在之反映的意识，通过实践转化为客观现实。如果根本否认观念的东西可以转化为客观的东西，那末，人类历史就成为不可理解的了。也正因为这样，所以形而上学唯物主义者，在自然领域内（在这里没有有意识地改造世界的活动，动物也只是消极地适应环境），还能基本上坚持唯物主义的观点，而在历史领域内则不能不陷入唯心主义，或者承认社会意识决定在社会存在，或者否认人的主观能动性，而通过机械论、宿命论陷入历史唯心主义。
    列宁在另一个地方又写道：“人的意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界”，这和“观念的东西转化为实在的东西”这一命题是一致的，也是马克思关于理论一旦掌握了群众就变成物质力量这一思想合乎逻辑的进一步发挥。“人的意识反映客观世界”，这是一般唯物主义的命题。形而上学唯物主义也仅仅到此为止。辩证唯物主义跟形而上学唯物主义相反，它不仅承认意识反映客观世界，而且在这个基础上又承认“意识创造客观世界”（当然不是指的创造物质，物质是既不能创造也不能消灭的，而是指的改变物质存在的形态）。当然，首先意识是客观存在的反映，正如列宁所说：“人的目的是客观世界所产生的，是以它为前提的”；其次，它创造客观世界是通过实践实现的，而能够收到改造客观世界的效果又是利用了而不是违背了客观规律。又如列宁所说：“外间世界、自然界的规律……乃是人的有目的的活动的基础”。这是辩证唯物主义和形而上学唯物主义在解决思维和存在的关系问题的一个基本分界线。
    承认作为存在之反映的观念，在一定条件下可以转化为实在的东西，承认“意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界”，也就是彻底地承认思维和存在的辩证法，彻底地把对立统一规律应用思维和存在的关系。而这样，也就进一步阐明和发挥了能动的革命的反映论。谁否认思维和存在的辩证法，否认把对立的统一规律应用于思维和存在的关系，谁就从根本上离开了辩证法的反映论、离开了能动的革命的反映论，因而也就不能把思维是存在的反映这个唯物主义的基本原则坚持到底。列宁所以特别注意这个问题，从理论上说来，因为它是辩证唯物主义认识论的一个重大原则问题，而从实践上看来，也是实际斗争所特别需要保卫和发挥的一个重大原则。
    上述列宁的思想，当然不是他偶然写下来的。不仅在《笔记》中许多地方发挥了这一思想，而且从他和各色各样的机会主义作斗争的著作中，我们也可以看到这个光辉的思想，及其同实际革命斗争的有机联系。列宁有一个著名的原理：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”，“只有受先进理论指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用。”很显然，这是同充分承认意识的能动作用，同承认“人的意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界”的哲学观点，一脉相承的。我们知道，“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”这个著名的原理，是列宁在同机会主义、经济主义作斗争中提出来的。经济主义者，否认理论和先进分子的作用，崇拜自发性，也就是要把工人运动限制在不触动资本主义制度的范围以内，反对工人去作推翻资产阶级政权的政治斗争。工人阶级的叛徒、修正主义者伯恩斯坦，当时提出了一个臭名昭著的口号：“运动是一切，而目的是没有的”，这就是不要工人为实现共产主义而进行从资产阶级手里夺取政权的政治斗争。第二国际的修正主义者们，在社会理论上都主张“生产力论”，就是否认生产关系对于生产力的反作用、上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用，认为社会的发展单纯地、直接地由生产技术决定，胡说什么“生产力”发展到一定的程度，资本主义就“自动”地“和平”长入社会主义了。这班人，都以机械论、生产力论“修正”历史唯物主义。他们的目的都是反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，为资产阶级效劳。而所有这些荒谬理论的哲学基础，又正是否认意识的能动作用。列宁强调和深刻发挥思维和存在的辩证法，强调和深刻发挥唯物辩证法的意识能动性的原理，正是为了粉碎修正主义谬论的哲学基础；而强调和深刻发挥这一点，也正是使不彻底的马克思主义者坚定起来所十分需要的。
    在今天，现代修正主义者在新的历史条件下，适应帝国主义的需要，对历史唯物主义继续作机械论的修正，他们的社会理论的基础还是“生产力论”，重弹“资本主义和平长入社会主义”的骗人滥调。因此，我们也必须坚持把辩证法应用于反映论，必须深刻发挥思维和存在的辩证法和意识的能动性原理。这对于批判现代修正主义有重要的意义。
    认识过程的辩证法
    把辩证法应用于反映论，还表现在用辩证法，特别是它的核心——对立的统一规律，阐明人的认识过程，阐明认识过程的辩证法，在实践基础上由感性认识飞跃到理性认识的辩证法。这一方面，列宁在《笔记》中也发挥了许多宝贵的天才的思想。
    我们知道：辩证唯物主义和形而上学唯物主义都承认世界是可知的，而且都是从反映论的立场上来承认的。但是，两者却有根本原则上的不同：前者认为认识是一个无限的充满矛盾的过程，认识与客观相符合是相对的、有条件的；而后者则相反，把认识客观世界看成是一下子达到的，把主观与客观相符合看成是绝对的、死板的。这是在世界可知论上辩证唯物主义和形而上学唯物主义的根本分歧。不能把辩证法应用于反映论，不能对认识和实践的关系作唯物辩证法的了解，也就不能理解认识过程的复杂性、由感性认识飞跃到理性认识的辩证法；因而，就不能对世界的可知性作辩证唯物主义的了解；当然，这样也就不能对康德主义的不可知论进行有力的战斗。而且形而上学的世界可知论的见解，在一定条件下，还会向不可知论转化。
    列宁写道：“康德把认识和客体割裂了开来，从而把人的认识（它的范畴、因果性、以及其他等等）的有限的、暂时的、相对的、有条件的性质当作主观主义，而不是当作观念（＝自然界本身）的辩证法。”这是从辩证唯物主义、从辩证唯物主义的可知论对康德主义一针见血的、最扼要、最击中要害的批判。
    形而上学唯物主义虽然主张可知论，但否认认识的相对性，看不见认识过程的复杂性，而认为对客观世界认识是可以一下子甚至可以只凭感觉达到的。这样，形而上学唯物主义当然不可能从理论上彻底驳倒不可知论。因为否认“人的认识（它的范畴、因果性、以及其他等等）的有限的、暂时的、相对的、有条件的性质”，就会犯下列错误：（一）把已经达到的认识看作“至矣，尽矣，不可以复加矣”的绝对真理，使思想僵化起来，不肯随着实践的发展而发展概念、范畴和原理。这样，就会硬要已经发展了的客观实际服从原先在自己头脑中构成的观念，而在实际上犯唯心主义的错误。（二）还可能在一定条件下向不可知论动摇。例如，当他们看到人们在认识过程中发生了某些不可避免的错误时，不了解这是认识过程的辩证法，而加以夸大，一律归结为主观主义。这也就如同康德一样，把认识的相对的、有条件的、暂时的性质当作主观主义了。持这种观点的人，当他坚持形而上学可知论的时候，要求在每个具体问题上认识和客观绝对符合；而当他发现这是不可能的时候，按照一贯的逻辑，就必然转化为不可知论了。
    形而上学唯物主义把思维反映存在看作是直观的，其中以感觉论著称的旧唯物主义则只承认感性认识靠得住，而否认或轻视理性认识，或者承认理性认识而否认它和感性认识的质的区别。这是“不能把辩证法应用于反映论，应用于认识过程和发展”的必然结果。列宁在《哲学笔记》中很重视感性认识和理性认识的辩证法，在很多地方都谈到了由感性认识到理性认识的能动飞跃，和概念、判断、推理的形成过程及其复杂性。列宁写道：“认识是人对自然界的反映，但是，这并不是简单的、直接的、完全的反映，而是一系列的抽象过程，即概念、规律等等的构成、形成过程，这些概念和规律等等……有条件地近似地把握着永恒运动着的和发展着的自然界的普遍规律性。”当人们的认识停顿在感性认识阶段，是不能把握世界运动的规律性的。而从感性认识上升到理性认识是一系列的抽象过程，在这个过程中如果不坚持辩证唯物主义，就会最后陷入唯心主义。列宁写道：“智慧（人的）对待个别事物的模写（＝概念），这不是简单地、直接的、照镜子那样死板的动作，而是复杂的二重化的、曲折的、有可能使幻想脱离生活的活动；不仅如此，它还有可能使抽象的概念、观念转变（而且是不知不觉的、人们意识不到的转变）成幻想（最后＝神）。”唯心主义的可能性“已经存在于最初的、最简单的抽象中。”列宁在《谈谈辩证法问题》一文里，还进一步分析了唯心主义的认识论根源。列宁的这种分析，不仅给了我们反对唯心主义，从它的认识论根源揭露其荒谬性的有力武器：而且也给我们证明了：把辩证法应用于反映论——应用于理论思维过程中的重要性，即研究作为客观辩证法之反映的思维辩证法——辩证逻辑，以它作指导对感觉材料进行加工，才能保证不在思维抽象过程中走入歧途，陷入唯心主义。这就是列宁特别重视辩证逻辑的研究的一个重要原因。
    真理的具体性和普遍性的辩证法
    在真理论的问题上，把辩证法应用于反映论，就是要在承认客观真理的基础上，揭明相对真理和绝对真理的辩证法，认识的标准（社会实践）的绝对性和相对性的辩证法，真理的具体性和普遍性的辩证法。关于前两者，列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》一书中作了深刻的阐明。我们知道，如果不把辩证法应用于反映论，弄清绝对真理和相对真理的辩证法，实践标准的绝对性和相对性的辩证法，就会陷入绝对主义或者相对主义，从这一点上就有可能完全离开辩证唯物主义的立场。在《笔记》中，列宁似乎更着重了真理的具体性和普遍性的辩证法。这里，我们就着重谈谈这个问题。
    大家知道：列宁认为“没有抽象的真理，真理总是具体的”。对这个原理应该怎样了解呢？可能有两种了解：一种是辩证法的了解，真理的具体性绝不排斥它的普遍性；一种是旧唯物主义感觉论的了解，只相信真理的具体性，不相信真理的普遍性，把二者对立起来，这就走上否认普遍真理的道路。
    列宁说：“真理是全面的”，“真理就是由现象，现实的一切方面的总和以及它们的（相互）关系构成的”。列宁在摘录了黑格尔《逻辑学》中“不只是抽象的普遍，而且是自身体现着特殊东西的丰富性的这种普遍”之后，批道：“绝妙的公式：不只是抽象的普遍，而且是自身体现着特殊、个体、个别东西的丰富性……的这种普遍！好极了！”当然，列宁的原则立场和黑格尔是根本相反的。很显然，列宁的批语，是对黑格尔的观点中的合理因素，加以唯物主义的改造和发挥。人们在实践基础上，由感性认识上升到理性认识，经过科学抽象所获得的具体概念、具体真理，是体现着特殊、个体、个别东西的丰富性的普遍；它既是具体的，又是普遍的。而“没有抽象的真理”的“抽象”一词，乃是指的没有体现特殊、个体、个别的丰富性的空洞的形式的抽象，而不是指的科学的抽象。列宁在《笔记》的好几个地方表述了这个思想。
    上述解释，还可以同马克思关于同一问题的论点相印证。马克思在《政治经济学批判》中指出：“人口”是一个现实的具体事物，它是许多规定性、许多因素的有机联系着的统一体，他说：“如果我抛开人口所由以构成的譬如阶级，人口是一个抽象。如果我不认识阶级所依据的因素如雇佣劳动、资本之类，阶级又是一句空话。……”（着重点是引者加的）所以，马克思说：“具体之所以为具体，因为它是许多规定的总结，因而是复杂物的统一。”
    辩证唯物主义所谓“真理是具体的”，绝不是说，它是对个别事物的感性直观，而是说，它是深刻反映了特殊、个别事物、过程的内在本质联系；真理的具体性，就意味着要求理论联系实际，运用一般原理解决具体问题时，必须和特殊相结合。正因为真理是具体的，所以它是普遍的；因为它是普遍的，所以它是具体的。这就是真理的具体性和普遍性的辩证法。
    但是，如果坚持旧唯物主义的感觉论，对“没有抽象的真理，真理总是具体的”这个原理作经验主义的了解，就会导致否认科学的抽象，否认普遍真理，就会把真理了解为此时此地的真理，那样，在真理问题上就和实用主义划不清界线了。
    现代资产阶级哲学和修正主义都用否认真理的普遍性来反对马克思主义。实用主义者胡适就胡说真理是人造的、应付环境的工具，从而断言普遍真理是“悬空的”、“抽象的”，他说：真理“乃是这个时间、这个境地、这个我的真理”。现代修正主义者就是夸大特殊，否认社会主义革命的普遍规律，否认真理的普遍性，把马克思主义的真理论和实用主义等同起来。例如南斯拉夫修正主义者马尔科维奇，无耻地以实用主义修正马克思主义的真理论，他故意混淆黑白，把杜威的真理论说成是马克思的真理论，并说：杜威的真理论，“早在杜威半个世纪之前，马克思就已对它进行论证过了”。由此可见，为了粉碎现代修正主义否认普遍真理的谬论，必须把辩证法应用于反映论，用真理的普遍性和具体性的辩证法同它进行战斗。为了巩固和提高我们自己的队伍，也必须阐明和宣传真理的普遍性和具体性的辩证法，批判旧唯物主义的感觉论倾向。
    关于研究辩证逻辑的指示
    把辩证法应用于反映论，还有一个重要的方面，就是揭明思维的辩证法，即辩证逻辑。当然，思维的辩证法是客观辩证法的反映，但是自觉的指导人们进行理论思维的辩证逻辑，却必须是阐明概念、判断、推理的辩证运动。列宁在《笔记》中是十分重视这个问题的。
    也可以说，列宁在《笔记》中对于辩证法的研究，就是对于辩证逻辑的研究。在这一方面，《笔记》中有许多天才的思想。列宁第一次给辩证逻辑下了科学的定义，他说：“逻辑不是关于思维的外在形式的学说，而是关于一切物质的、自然的和精神的事物的发展规律的学说，即关于世界的全部具体内容及对它的认识的发展规律的学说。换句话说，逻辑是对世界的认识的历史的总结、总和、结论”。这个定义，不仅揭示了辩证逻辑的本质；而且指明了研究辩证逻辑的具体途径，指明了研究人类认识史对于发展辩证逻辑的意义；同时也指明了研究各门认识史的目的和方向。列宁还指出了辩证逻辑的主要内容。他写道：“概念的关系（＝转化＝矛盾）＝逻辑的主要内容，并且这些概念（及其关系、转化、矛盾）是作为客观世界的反映而被表现出来的。事物的辩证法创造观念的辩证法，而不是相反”。他又说：“辩证法（据后文，显然这里是指辩证逻辑——引者注）是什么？概念的相互依赖——一切概念的毫无例外的相互依赖；一个概念向另一个概念的转化——一切概念毫无例外的转化。概念之间对立的相对性……概念之间对立面的同一。注意，每一概念都处在和其余一切概念的一定关系中、一定的联系中。”简单说来，列宁的意思就是：辩证逻辑要揭示概念之间的联系、依存、转化，概念的矛盾、对立的同一；人们的概念和由概念构成的判断、推理，不应该是僵化的、互不联系的，而“应当是灵活的、能动的、相对的、相互联系的、在对立中的是统一的，这样才能把握世界”，因为客观世界本来是对立的统一，是物质的矛盾运动。的确，这是辩证逻辑的主要内容，它是研究辩证逻辑的纲要。
    列宁在《笔记》中还提出了研究辩证逻辑的问题，概略地说来，主要的就是：（一）辩证地研究认识史。这对于建立辩证逻辑的体系是非常重要的，因为辩证逻辑是认识史的概括、总结、精华，逻辑的东西和历史的东西是一致的。（二）研究《资本论》的辩证逻辑。列宁说：“虽然马克思没有遗留下《逻辑》（大写字母的），但是他遗留下《资本论》的逻辑，应当充分地利用这种逻辑来解决当前的问题”。在《论战斗的唯物主义的意义》一文中，列宁再次地提出了这个任务。列宁的这个指示，对于我们今天研究辩证逻辑，当然还是适用的；但我们还应该研究列宁的著作和毛泽东同志的著作中的辩证逻辑，他们的著作同样是把辩证法应用于思维过程、应用于概念、判断、推理的典范。（三）另外，列宁还提出批判地研究黑格尔的著作的任务，在《论战斗的唯物主义的意义》中他也再次的提出了这个任务。当然不能设想，从黑格尔的《逻辑学》拣现成的东西，而必须予以彻底批判。关于这一点列宁在《笔记》中写道：“不能原封不动地应用黑格尔的逻辑；不能把它现成地搬来。要挑选出其中逻辑的（认识论的）成分，清除掉它的神秘观念；这还是一项巨大的工作”。因为有了列宁的“用唯物主义观点来读黑格尔的著作”的典范，特别是有了他的很详尽的摘要和批语，我们研究黑格尔的著作，应该说是比较的易于收效了。现在，辩证逻辑还是我们哲学研究工作中的一个最薄弱的部门，我们应该遵照列宁的指示，结合我国社会主义建设的实践，加强这一方面的研究。对于提高我们的干部的思想方法，对于从认识论上更尖锐、更深刻地批判资产阶级哲学和现代修正主义，这种研究都是有重大意义的。
    列宁关于把辩证法应用于反映论的论述、逻辑、辩证法和唯物主义认识论“是同一个东西”的思想，以及他进一步把辩证法应用于认识过程，从而对马克思主义认识论的发展，都是我们在哲学领域中极其宝贵的思想财富。列宁提出的反对把辩证法和认识论割裂，在今天仍然是很重要的；列宁提出的把辩证法应用于反映论的方向，永远是正确的。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，是十分重视列宁的《哲学笔记》的。他继承列宁，在领导中国人民革命斗争的实践中，进一步把辩证法应用于反映论，应用于认识过程和发展，从而从各个方面发展了马克思主义的认识论。例如，毛泽东同志进一步把对立的统一规律应用于思维和存在、理论和实践的关系，进一步阐明了思维和存在、理论和实践的辩证法。他指出：“生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用”，“然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用”。这是对马克思主义辩证法、认识论的重大发挥，也是对历史唯物主义的重大发挥。他深刻地阐明了“主观和客观、理论和实践、知和行的具体的历史的统一”，并从中国革命的实践经验以及人类认识史总结出了认识运动的最基本的规律，这就是他的著名的公式：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”毛泽东同志还把对立的统一规律应用于“人类认识运动的秩序”，他阐明了人类的认识，总是由特殊到一般、再由一般到特殊“这样循环往复地进行的，而每一次的循环（只要是严格地按照科学的方法）都可能使人类的认识提高一步，使人类的认识不断地深化。”毛泽东同志还把对立的统一规律应用于领导和群众的关系，他指出领导者必须先当群众的学生，然后才能当群众的先生，并根据中国革命的经验，总结出了从群众中集中起来、又到群众中坚持下去……这样循环往复、使实践和认识不断提高的群众路线的认识论公式。毛泽东同志还把对立的统一规律应用于真理的发展过程，深刻地指明了真理在同错误斗争中发展的规律，他说：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。……当着某一种错误的东西被人类普遍地抛弃，某一种真理被人类普遍地接受的时候，更加新的真理又在同新的错误意见作斗争。这种斗争永远不会完结。这是真理发展的规律……。”毛泽东同志进一步把辩证法，特别是它的核心——对立的统一规律应用于逻辑思维，他指出：一切事物都有二重性，因此我们必须用两点论，而不能用形而上学的一点论观察事物，而且必须善于区别“九个指头和一个指头”、主流和支流、大局和小局。他的一切著作都是辩证思考的典范，而《矛盾论》则从认识论上进一步阐明了思维的辩证法。毛泽东同志对马克思主义认识论的新发展，是同现代资产阶级哲学、修正主义作斗争的锐利武器；是我国社会主义建设飞速发展的理论基础。随着实践的发展和时间的推移，它将日益显示其光辉。而毛泽东同志对马克思主义认识论的这些新发展，都是直接继承了列宁的思想，都是贯彻了列宁在《哲学笔记》所发挥的把辩证法应用于反映论，把作为认识方法的辩证法、逻辑和认识论溶为一体，反对割裂辩证法和认识论这样一个基本思想。
    列宁在《哲学笔记》中所发挥的思想，具有非常深远的意义。《哲学笔记》永远是我们认真学习的一部伟大著作！（附图片）
