Fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft National Budget and Final Accounts. These are a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.

    The workers in Hangzhou's factories are full of energy, and have made great achievements in technical innovation
    I visited six large and small factories, two people's communes, and the Xin'anjiang Reservoir in Hangzhou this time. I saw the brilliant achievements everywhere in the two years of the Great Leap Forward. The thorough implementation of the simultaneous development and two-legged walking policy accurately reflects the superiority of the socialist economy and the inevitability of high-speed development.

    Hangzhou was originally a city without steel or iron, relying entirely on Shanghai for supplies. In 1957, construction began on the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, starting from scratch. In just over a year, it achieved an annual output of 340,000 tons of steel, playing a decisive role in the four modernizations. Workers are able to apply cutting-edge scientific theories such as electricity, magnets, and eccentric wheels to improve tools and organize assembly line operations, among other new achievements.

    The Hangzhou Sewing Machine Factory is a specialized factory. Red flags are hung everywhere in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Labor intensity has been reduced, 358 machine tools have been modified, and work efficiency has increased by two to thirty times, with the highest reaching two hundred times. It has also trained more than 700 workers for other factories. This year's plan is for 30,000 tons, more than double last year's. There are not many specialized factories like this in the country, and it is still being expanded.

    The Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory had only forty workers and four hand looms before liberation. Now it has 1,700 workers and 300 power looms. Black and white silk weaving has now been converted to electric motors, increasing output by more than six times. It has also created three-dimensional woven products and various new products reflecting real life. In the past, a slightly complex picture would take more than a year to complete the first step of preparation, including drawing grids and carving paper boards. Now, it only takes four months or less to put it into production.

    The Hangzhou Flax Mill was built after liberation in 1949 and put into production in August 1950. Annual output has increased fivefold year by year. Now it operates as an assembly line, reducing the number of processes from eighteen to seven, thereby saving more than 1,000 workers. The three-shift system has been changed to a two-shift system, and some skilled workers have been drawn out to specialize in various innovations, such as building underground yarn conveyor belts, changing combing from two times to one time, and changing three drafting passes to one drafting pass, increasing output and saving a sewing line. The sewing machine has also been converted to automation. New products such as rayon are also being manufactured. Due to the tight supply of flax raw materials, various impurity fibers are now being used. The use of raw cotton stalks is also being tried, but the combing problem has not yet been fully resolved. There are more than 700 shock workers in the entire factory, with women workers accounting for 102. It runs a spare-time school and night university, and is a factory without illiteracy.

    The Huafeng Paper Mill's output was 19,000 tons in 1957, 27,000 tons in 1958, and 30,000 tons in 1959. This year's target is 65,000 tons, striving for 70,000 tons. In 1958, large satellite factories, large and small blast furnaces, and rayon workshops were built, with paper making as the base, taking care of both wings, and both wings have great development prospects. In the fourth quarter of last year, a new upsurge of technical innovation was launched. Continuous operation in the workshop, pulping, cooking, bleaching, pulp conveying, finished products, paper winding, and paper cutting are all fully automated and centrally managed, operated by a button console. There are 445 innovation projects. High-quality ribbed cigarette paper used to use 90% hemp pulp and 10% wood pulp. Now it is changed to 35% bamboo shoot shell pulp, 35% wood pulp, and 30% waste hemp, reducing raw materials and costs, and improving quality.

    The Hangzhou Silk Umbrella Factory was recently merged and operated. It was originally a scattered small family handicraft operation, not even worthy of being called a workshop. Since the merger, it has greatly developed, and some parts have also been converted to semi-mechanization. There have been great improvements in color and pattern, making it light, beautiful, and suitable for the needs of the masses. In addition to domestic sales, it also has an export task of 100,000 umbrellas every year, earning more than 400,000 yuan in foreign exchange for the country.

    Since the Hangzhou Machine Factory launched the four modernizations movement, the degree of mechanization of the entire factory has rapidly increased, soaring to more than 80%. All machine tools have achieved semi-automation and automation, and assembly line casting has also appeared. The first quarter's national plan was completed in twenty-six days. The scrap rate was reduced by 4.26%. A five-ton electric overhead crane was made using indigenous methods in more than ten days at a cost of 20,000 yuan, increasing the utilization rate of large machine tool equipment by 30%. A fast, multi-tool, powerful cutting innovation was completed in two days, increasing efficiency by four times. Any innovation in the factory is immediately appraised and immediately promoted.

    The workers in the above-mentioned factories that I visited are full of energy, and it is very common for them not to leave their posts for three or five days. Seeing the great achievements made by the factories in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and the methods used, they first clearly recognized the relationship between innovation and production, established the unified view of vigorously engaging in innovation and completing production tasks, that is, innovation for the purpose of increasing production, and increasing production must be innovative. They carried out planned progress, grasped the key to production, started with reducing heavy labor intensity and liberating labor, and then mobilized the masses to explore potential and propose measures, concentrated opinions, and then discussed, revised, and implemented them by the masses. Advancing step by step, wave after wave of upsurges were launched. At the same time, they extracted three materials (raw materials, materials, fuel) from technical innovation and technical revolution. First, they wanted to reduce the consumption of three materials, second, they wanted to comprehensively utilize them to eliminate waste, and third, they wanted to find substitutes. All of these have inexhaustible potential. The supply of three materials will then promote the comprehensive and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. From this, not only can we see the Great Leap Forward of the previous two years and the continued Great Leap Forward this year, but we can also be sure of the leap forward year after year in the future, because now it is only the beginning of technical innovation and technical revolution. We can see the cause planted in last year's mass steelmaking, steelmaking in furnaces, and cultivating people beside furnaces, breaking superstitions, and liberating thought. And in fact, it is the result obtained from the two magic weapons of the Great Leap Forward and the socialist general line. It cannot be done without Mao Zedong Thought, without mass movements. Industry is like this, and agriculture is also like this.

    Industry supports agriculture, and agriculture also supports industry
    The Jianqiao People's Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou City mainly produces vegetables. Last winter, it made arrangements for "three guarantees" to the end and prepared for production, innovating and repairing 9,000 pieces of indigenous agricultural tools, discarding carrying poles, and eliminating blank spaces. It also established more than 20 factories, and the farmers became skilled workers, especially the woodworking machinery factory. Last year, the average net income per household was about 688 yuan.

    The West Lake People's Commune mainly produces tea. Tea making has already used semi-mechanization. In 1959, the yield of dry tea per mu was 241 jin. This year, management has been strengthened, the tea picking season has been extended, and it is required that the yield of dry tea be 500 jin, which can be achieved. Tea aphids have been eliminated, 38,000 new houses have been built, the average net income per household is 542 yuan, and there is a tea middle school.

    From these two communes, we can see the superiority of the people's commune, which is inseparable from the Great Leap Forward and the general line. Industry supports agriculture, and agriculture also supports industry. Mutual proportional advancement is also a high-speed advancement of socialist construction. With these three magic weapons, we can continuously carry out economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, and cultural revolution, which is the result of mass technical innovation and technical revolution, and also the inevitable product of the three magic weapons. These are all great victories for Mao Zedong Thought. We must stand under the banner of Mao Zedong and conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought as the lighthouse for our future work.

    Linking with reality, conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works to achieve fundamental personal transformation
    In the past, I studied Mao Zedong's works from the text, and I was not able to combine them with thinking and practice. For example, although I read "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" several times and discussed them several times, I still did not understand the essential spirit. I ate half-cooked rice. It was not until I studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that I deeply realized that this classic work did not quote a single philosophical theoretical term from "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," but not a single sentence left the philosophical theoretical assertions and analyses of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." I confirmed that philosophical theory was applied in practice, which gave me a further understanding of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." The past learning method was completely wrong. From this, I realized that theory divorced from practice is empty theory, and practice divorced from theory is blind practice. In the future, I must read a paragraph and think about a paragraph, read an article and think about an article, and use new things to ponder how things were viewed in the past and how they are viewed after reading, think about everything, compare articles, so that reading an article will get an education, and further study how to apply it to specific things and work problems in politics, economics, and ideology.

    In this study, everything mentioned in the reports of the two vice premiers is a great achievement obtained under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, I realize that for an individual, more Mao Zedong Thought means more freedom and more creation, in order to gradually achieve fundamental personal transformation. I do not know if this statement is correct, and I hope to receive guidance.

专栏：

    党的总路线的胜利
    周士观委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理的国民经济计划草案报告，和李先念副总理的国家预决算草案的报告，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    杭州各工厂的工人们干劲冲天，技术革新取得很大成绩
    我这次到杭州参观了六个大小工厂，二个人民公社，和新安江水库。看到了在两年大跃进中，处处灿烂辉煌的成绩。彻底的贯彻了同时并举两条腿走路的方针，确切的反映了社会主义经济的优越性和高速度发展的必然性。
    杭州本是无钢无铁的城市，一切仰借于上海的供应。在1957年开始建设了半山钢铁厂，平地起楼台，一年多的时间，就年产了三十四万吨的钢，在四化革新方面起了决定性的作用。工人同志们都能应用电力、磁铁和偏心轮等尖端科学理论来改善工具，和组织一条龙的流水作业等等新成绩。
    杭州制养机厂，是专业厂，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，处处挂有红旗，减轻劳动强度，改装了机床三百五十八台，工作效率提高了二倍至三十倍，有最高的提到二百倍，并为外厂培养工人七百余人。本年计划三万吨，超过去年的一倍有余，在国内这专业厂是不多有的，现尚在扩建中。
    杭州都锦生丝织厂，解放前原有工人四十名，四个手织机。现在有一千七百工人，三百台机织机。黑白丝织现改为电动机，增加产量六倍以上，并创作了立体的织品，及其他反映现实生活的各种新产品，过去一张稍为复杂图片，在画格、刻纸板，都要一年以上才能完成第一步筹备工作，现在只要有四个月或更少时间，就可投入生产。
    杭州麻纺厂，1949年解放后开始建设，1950年8月投入生产，年产量逐年增加至五倍。现在组成一条龙进行作业，从十八道工序减至七道，因此就减省了一千余人的劳动力。从三班制改为两班制，抽出一部分熟练工人专门研究各种革新，如搞地下运纱传送带，梳麻从二次改为一次，三道并条改为一道并条，产量增高，并减省一道缝线，缝线机亦已改为自动化。另制造新产品人造丝，在麻原料供应紧张，现采用各种杂质纤维。并试用生棉秆皮，唯在梳理问题尚未全部解决。在全厂有七百余人闯将，女工占有一百零二个。办有业余学校和夜大学，是一个无盲厂。
    华丰造纸厂在1957年产量一万九千吨，1958年二万七千吨，1959年三万吨，今年指标为六万五千吨争取七万吨。在1958年大办卫星厂，大小高炉，和人造丝车间，以造纸为基，照顾两翼，而两翼都有很大的发展前途。在去年第四季度掀起了技术革新的新高潮，车间连续化，打浆、煮浆、漂白、输浆、成品、卷纸、裁纸等是全套自动化集中管理，由电钮台操作。革新项目有四百四十五件。高质罗纹香烟纸过去用大麻浆90％，木浆10％，现在改用竹笋壳浆35％，木浆35％，废麻30％，减低原料和成本，并提高了品质。
    杭州丝绸伞厂，是不久合营起来的，本来是个分散的小家庭手工作业，还够不上称作作坊，自合并以后，就大大有了发展，一部分也改为半机械化。在彩色和图案方面都有很大的改进，轻便美丽，适合群众的要求，除内销外，每年还有十万把的外销任务，为国家争取了四十多万元外汇。
    杭州机器厂掀起了四化运动以来，全厂机械化程度迅速提高，猛增在80％以上，全部机床已经实现了半自动化和自动化，并出现了浇铸流水作业。以二十六天时间，完成了第一季度国家计划。废品率降低了4.26％。用了十多天时间，二万元成本，土法制成一台五吨电动行车，使大机床设备利用率增长30％，用两天工夫革新了快速多刀强力切削，效率增加四倍，在该厂一有革新立即鉴定，马上推广。
    所看的以上各厂工人们干劲冲天，三五天不离开岗位是很寻常的事。看到各厂在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中取得伟大成绩，而进行方法，先明确认识到革新和生产的关系，树立起大闹革新和完成生产任务相统一的观点，就是革新为了增产，增产必须革新，有计划的进行，抓住生产关键，从减少繁重劳动强度、解放劳动力下手，然后发动群众摸潜力、提措施，把意见集中起来，再经过群众讨论、修改和贯彻执行。一步紧一步的前进，一浪逐一浪高潮就掀起来了。同时向技术革新和技术革命索取三料（原料、材料、燃料），一要降低三料消耗，二要综合利用使无废物，三要找代替品，这都有不尽的潜力。三料供应跟上来，又会促进技术革新和技术革命运动全面深入的发展。由此不但可以看到前两年的大跃进，今年持续大跃进，更可肯定今后年年的跃进，因为现在不过是技术革新和技术革命的开始。可以看在去年大炼钢铁，炉中炼钢，炉旁炼人，破除迷信，解放思想，种下的因。而实在是在大跃进和社会主义总路线两个法宝所得到的果。工业如此农业亦是如此。没有毛泽东思想，不是群众运动，是搞不起来的。
    工业支援了农业，农业也支援了工业
    杭州市郊笕桥人民公社，是以蔬菜为主要产品，在去年冬天已做好“三包”到底的布置，做好生产的准备，革新和修配土农具九千件。丢下了扁担，消灭了空白地。并办了二十余个工厂，农民成为能工巧匠，木器机械厂尤为特出。去年每户平均净收入约为六百八十八元。
    西湖人民公社以茶叶为主要产品，制茶已用了半机械化。1959年亩产干茶二百四十一斤，今年加强管理，延长采茶时期，要求干茶五百斤，是可以达到的。消灭茶蚜虫，修建三万八千间新屋，每户平均净收入为五百四十二元，并办有茶叶中学。
    从这两社就可看到人民公社的优越性，同大跃进和总路线是分不开的，工业支援了农业，农业也支援了工业，相互有比例的推进，也就是高速度推进了社会主义建设事业，有了这三个法宝不断进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、文化革命，也就是群众性的技术革新和技术革命的结果，也是三大法宝的必然产物，这都是毛泽东思想的伟大的胜利。我们必须站在毛泽东旗帜下，认真学习毛泽东思想作为我们今后工作前进的灯塔。
    联系实际，认真学习毛主席著作，达到个人的根本改造
    我过去学习毛泽东著作都是从文字上学习，没有能结合思想和实践中来学习。如学习矛盾论和实践论虽读了好几遍，讨论过好几次，还是没有体会到实质精神，吃了夹生饭，一直到学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，深切体会到这一篇的经典著作没有一句引用到实践论和矛盾论的哲学理论名词，而没有一句是离开了实践论和矛盾论哲学理论的论断和分析，确认了在实践中应用了哲学理论，使我对矛盾论实践论有了进一步的理解，过去学习方法是完全错误的，从而认识到离开实践的理论是空洞的理论，离开了理论的实践是盲目的实践。今后学习必须读一段想一段，读一篇想一篇，联系新生事物来揣摹，那些事物在过去是怎样看法，读了之后又是怎样看法，处处着想，篇篇比较，使读一篇得到一篇的教育，更进一步来学习在政治上经济上思想上，如何来应用于具体的事物上工作上的问题的解决。
    这一次学习两位副总理的报告中提到的一切的伟绩丰功，都是在党的领导下，以毛泽东思想为主导的贯彻执行所获得。因此认识到对个人来说，是多一点毛泽东思想，就多一点自由，就多一点创作，以求逐步的达到个人的根本改造。这个说法是否正确，即希予以指正。
