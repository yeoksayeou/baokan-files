    Actively Promote Rice Transplanters
    The mass movement of agricultural technology innovation and technological revolution is flourishing across the country. Hand tools that have been used for thousands of years are being, and already have been, replaced by new agricultural implements and agricultural machinery. This year, the nation will promote 4.5 million rice transplanters, and about 70% of the country’s rice paddies (350 million mu) will use transplanters. This is a major event in the reform of agricultural technology in our country, and a revolution in rice cultivation techniques.
    After several years of experimentation, research, and widespread use, our transplanters have entered the stage of mass production and promotion. Rural cadres and the masses in the vast rice-producing areas are very welcome to the transplanters, and many places have formed a mass upsurge in the promotion and use of transplanters. According to the experience of Guangxi, three links must be firmly grasped in the whole process of promoting transplanters. The first is that in manufacturing, the quality of the transplanter must be guaranteed. This is not simply a technical issue, but also a political issue. If the transplanter is not up to standard, it will not only waste manpower, materials, and financial resources, but also seriously dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and affect the reputation of the transplanter. Therefore, every leader and worker engaged in the manufacture of transplanters should be educated to clearly establish the concept of "guaranteeing quality and guaranteeing increased production," and to make every transplanter easy to use, labor-saving, and highly efficient.
    The second is to train a group of rice transplanter operators who are both red and expert. The experience of many regions has proven that the transplanter can only give full play to its role when it is mastered by people with full political enthusiasm and skilled operating techniques. Before the transplanting season, all localities should actively do a good job in technical training and train a group of ingenious transplanter operators as soon as possible. These transplanter operators should all meet the requirements of being able to use, repair, and maintain the machines, and become activists and backbones in the future for more extensive promotion and use of transplanters.
    The third is to do a good job in the maintenance and storage of transplanters. To fully demonstrate its strong vitality, the transplanter must not only show its skills from the moment it goes into action, but also stand the test of time. If maintenance and storage are not paid attention to on weekdays, and the machine parts fail when used, it will inevitably greatly affect the efficiency of transplanting and delay the farming season. Therefore, in the promotion work, it is necessary to establish a complete set of responsibility systems for use, maintenance, and storage.
    At present, the double-cropping rice areas have generally begun sowing, and some areas are already transplanting; the single-cropping rice areas are organizing the rice paddies and preparing for sowing. All localities should seize the time and actively promote transplanters in order to gain experience and lay a solid and reliable foundation for the gradual realization of rice transplanter mechanization in the future, and advance the technological transformation movement of our agriculture by a big step.

    积极推广水稻插秧机
    全国农业技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正在蓬勃开展。千百年来一直沿用的手工工具，已经和正在被新式农具和农业机械所代替。今年，全国将推广四百五十万部水稻插秧机，在我国广大水稻产区将有70％左右的水稻田（三亿五千万亩）使用插秧机插秧，就是其中的一例。这是我国农业技术改革方面的一件大事，是水稻栽培技术上的一个革命。
    经过几年来的试验、研究和大面积上的使用实践，我们的插秧机已经进入大量制造和推广的阶段。广大水稻产区的农村干部和群众对插秧机非常欢迎，很多地方形成了群众性的推广和使用插秧机的热潮。根据广西的经验，在推广插秧机的整个过程中，必须抓紧三个环节。首先是在制造中，一定要保证插秧机的质量。这不简单是个技术问题，也是个政治问题。如果插秧机不合规格，不仅浪费人力、物力、财力，而且将严重挫伤群众的积极性，影响插秧机的声誉。因此，要教育每一个领导和从事制造插秧机的工人，明确树立“保证质量，保证增产”的观念，要使每一架插秧机都好使、省力、效率高。
    其次是要培养一批又红又专的插秧机手。许多地区的经验证明，插秧机只有掌握在政治热情饱满、操作技术熟练的人手中，才能充分发挥出它的作用。各地在插秧季节前，要积极做好技术训练工作，及早培训出一批心红手巧的插秧机手。要使这些插秧机手，都达到会使用、会检修、会保管的要求，成为今后更广泛地推广和使用插秧机的积极分子和骨干。
    第三是做好插秧机的维修保管工作。插秧机要充分显示它强大的生命力，不仅从上阵起就要大显身手，还必须经得起时间的考验。如果平日不注意维修保管，使用起来机件失灵，必然要大大影响插秧工效，贻误农时。因此在推广工作当中，建立一整套使用、维修和保管的责任制度，是十分必要的。
    目前，双季稻产区已普遍开始播种，一部分地区已经在插秧；单季稻产区正在整理秧田，准备播种。各地应抓紧一刻千金的时机，积极推广插秧机，以便取得经验，为今后逐步实现水稻插秧机化打下坚实可靠的基础，把我国的农业技术改造运动向前推进一大步。
