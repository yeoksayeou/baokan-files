Comrades and Committee Members:
    We endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget draft, the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's Work Report on the Third National Committee of the CPPCC from the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee.
    We participated in the CPPCC National Committee medical and health inspection group this year in February and March, and visited Shanxi, Henan and other places, focusing on the health situation in Jishan County, Jinan Prefecture, Shanxi Province. We would now like to report to the conference on the health situation in this county:
    Jishan - A Red Banner for Rural Health
    Jishan County is a good place with fertile land, abundant resources, a warm climate, and hardworking and courageous people. However, in the years of reactionary rule, the people lived a very poor life, and the cultural and health conditions were very backward and miserable. For example, in 1943, in Xiwai Village, Zhaidian Commune, this county, 27% of the farmers went bankrupt because of the treatment of diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera. In a small alley with twenty-six households and seventy-two people, nineteen people died, and five families were wiped out. After liberation, the people turned over and became masters of their lives. With the development of production, the people's material and cultural life has been continuously improved, and the health care cause has also been greatly developed and improved. However, the very backward health conditions left over from the reactionary rule have not been completely changed. Until 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, not only did production achieve a great leap forward, but health work also had a flying development; especially after the communization, the whole county's health outlook underwent a fundamental change. Our inspection group comrades praised the tremendous and rapid changes in Jishan County's health outlook. Now, this county has become a red banner for rural health in the whole country.
    Jishan County's achievements are first reflected in the elimination of pests and diseases. The whole county has basically eliminated the four pests. We did not find any of the four pests in the places we visited, and lice, fleas, etc. have also basically disappeared. They have not only eliminated seven major diseases such as smallpox, malaria, typhus, cholera, and relapsing fever, and controlled multiple diseases such as measles, diphtheria, dysentery, and influenza, but have also developed to general survey and treatment of general diseases. In 1959 alone, more than 85,700 patients with trachoma, ascaris, hemorrhoids, cervicitis, and trichomonas vaginalis were treated.
    Environmental sanitation is also very satisfactory. All the streets are repaired flat, clean and tidy. The walls are whitewashed with lime, and various health regulations and systems are written on them. The commune members' houses have been renovated and refreshed, and the yards and houses are very clean, with everything arranged in an orderly manner. Moreover, the basic construction of health work is combined with the work of building a new socialist countryside by perfuming, greening, and beautifying, and renovating houses and streets. Many narrow streets and alleys have been widened, and most of the streets have been planted with various small trees. From the streets to the courtyards, various beautiful and fragrant flowers and plants are also planted. What particularly caught our attention was the public toilets. They are located in the open spaces at the four corners outside the village, with chair-style toilets for the elderly and rocking horse-style toilets for children, making them hygienic and safe. More than 98% of the toilets that should be renovated in the county have been renovated. Manure pits and manure fermentation fields have been improved.
    Their concern for human health has further developed into epidemic prevention and health care for livestock and poultry. Chickens have modern "three-story" chicken coops. The pigs' "dormitories" are even more beautiful. We have visited the high-standard Wan Tou Pig Farm in the Northern Ping Management District. They live in separate troughs and have their "nurseries," "canteens," "bathhouses," and "sports fields." This not only guarantees hygiene, but also guarantees the growth and reproduction of pigs, and is also convenient for accumulating fertilizer.
    Collective health care and labor protection work are more satisfactory than the above-mentioned environmental sanitation. The fire and cooking in the public canteens are separate. The fire is burned outside the house, and the cooking is done inside the house. No smoke or dust can enter. They call it "dust-free stove." The water is filtered through a water filter pool first. Vegetable cutting is divided into raw vegetable and cooked vegetable cases to avoid the spread of bacteria from raw vegetables to cooked vegetables. The canteen also has a running water washbasin, gargle station, disinfection station, and dishwashing station. Before and after meals, the commune members can consciously wash their hands and gargle. The canteen also determines a recipe according to the various staple and non-staple foods supplied by the management area, and cooks food according to the prescribed types and quantities of staple and non-staple foods to ensure that each person can get more than 2,600 grams of heat per day. Sewing groups, laundry groups, foot washing pools, and bath ponds have been universally established throughout the county. Women receive the care they deserve. Pregnant women move into the waiting room half a month before delivery, and can rest in the maternity hospital for a month after delivery, and are subsidized with eggs and brown sugar. After being discharged from the hospital, the baby can be placed in the nursing room, which provides free goat milk, and transferred to the nursery after six months. In particular, after the implementation of the "three adjustments and three non-adjustments" system (adjust dryness but not wetness during menstruation, adjust lightness but not weight during pregnancy, and adjust nearness but not farness during lactation), gynecological diseases have been greatly reduced and have been unanimously supported by commune members.
    The good health care work in Jishan County is inseparable from the establishment of a sound health care network. After communization, they promptly established a new health care network in emerging factories, pastures, forest farms, reservoirs, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens and other collective living and collective welfare undertakings in accordance with the characteristics of collective production and life. At present, there are hospitals in the county and each commune, health stations in each management area, and health rooms in each production team. The medical and health care team has been continuously developed, and more than 20,000 medical and health care personnel have been trained and improved. Traditional Chinese medicine has played a very important role in health care work. They have already achieved "ordinary diseases do not leave the commune, general minor diseases do not leave the district, and work-related injuries and acute diseases do not leave the team," "reporting diseases by hanging a pole, doctors come to the door, field rounds, and seeing diseases in the fields." Medical cards and health records have been established for every person and household in the county. At present, the county is vigorously promoting the collective health care system of Taiyang Village. In particular, the popularization of national health knowledge education is being carried out. In the mass movement to popularize national health education last winter, 200,000 people understood the health knowledge of preventing and treating more than 15 common diseases.
    Another important manifestation of the achievements of health work in Jishan County is the change in the people's spiritual outlook. Paying attention to hygiene, breaking superstitions, and believing in science have become new social customs. "Seeking gods and worshiping Buddha when sick" has become material for everyone to talk and laugh about, and incense burners have become flower pots. The old ladies also pay attention to hygiene and have also formed a Tai Chi training class. When we went to visit, they gave us a special performance. It has become a conscious habit not to spit everywhere or litter paper scraps, cigarette butts and debris.
    Health Work Serves Production
    The health work in Jishan County is not carried out in isolation, but adheres to production as the center, health work starts from production, closely combines with production, and serves production. Therefore, not only has health work achieved brilliant achievements and improved the people's physique, but it has also greatly promoted the development of production. Nearly one-third of the population in the county has reached the first, second, and juvenile levels of the labor and health system, and more than 10,000 people have reached the level of athletes. Among the more than 11,400 patients with chronic diseases, more than 9,000 have recovered their health and put into production after treatment. It is precisely because of the improvement of the people's physique and good health that the attendance rate of labor in the county has often remained above 95%, and some villages have reached above 98%, which has strongly promoted the development of production. The county has successively achieved a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 and 1959, and has won the honorary title of Shanxi Province's model county for wheat production.
    At present, the health care work in Jishan County has achieved
  "Regularization, institutionalization, and habitualization," and has changed from regular symptomatic treatment to thorough radical treatment, from eliminating major diseases and multiple diseases to general investigation and treatment of general diseases, from treating patients to protecting healthy people, from personal hygiene to collective life hygiene, from renovating the environment and courtyards to building a new countryside, and people's spiritual outlook has been completely renewed.
    People's Communes Bring Superior Conditions to Health Care Work
    The changes in the health care outlook in Jishan County are enormous. From these changes, we can not only see the great achievements of the national health work under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, but also look forward with confidence to the national rural health care outlook, which is undergoing profound changes with the continuous leap forward in production, and is moving towards the goal of changing customs and transforming the world.
    Jishan County's health work does not have any special superior conditions, but because the Party committee holds high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adheres to the policy of developing health undertakings with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, strengthens propaganda and education with the spirit of continuous revolution, fully mobilizes the masses, combines with the production movement, and carries out mass pest elimination and disease prevention health movement, especially in the past two years, it has fundamentally changed the past backward outlook. The victory of Jishan County is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the result of earnestly implementing the Party's health work policy of "serving workers, peasants and soldiers, giving priority to prevention, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining health work with mass movements." This fact educates us that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the Party's general line and the Party's health work policy, and adhere to carrying out mass health movements, we will surely continue to leap forward and advance from victory to victory, and we can realize the task of eliminating pests and diseases given to us by the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule.
    The most important guarantee for the great achievements of health care work in Jishan County is that the people's commune has brought into play its unparalleled superiority. Before the communization, the county had only one county hospital, five regional hospitals, thirteen health stations, and one hundred and eighty-seven health rooms. After the communization, the health care network was expanded, developing to two county hospitals, twelve commune hospitals, one hundred and thirty-five health stations, and more than one thousand health rooms. Without the people's commune, it would be impossible to increase medical and health care units by such multiples, several times, or dozens of times. At present, not only is it convenient for the masses to see a doctor, but also because the establishment of health care organizations is adapted to the production organization, it greatly facilitates the unified arrangement and close combination of production and health. The masses enthusiastically praised: "The health room is so good, it can treat all diseases and injuries, it would not be dreamed of without communization," "The people's commune cares about people, we are more energetic in doing it, the labor insurance system is really good, people live more and more vigorously." With the increasing consolidation and development of the people's commune, it will give full play to its unparalleled power and bring more superior conditions to health care work. The development of health care will also play an active role in promoting the people's commune.
    We deeply feel that this visit is a profound socialist education and learning. At the same time, we have a deeper understanding that intellectuals must accelerate their self-transformation. Not only must we draw a clear line between the ideological boundaries of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but also through studying Chairman Mao's writings and Marxism-Leninism, through social practice and participation in labor, we must establish a strong proletarian world outlook and establish the feelings of workers and peasants. Only in this way can we consciously listen to the Party, integrate with workers and peasants, have a common language, and give full play to our strength to make due contributions to the socialist and communist construction of the motherland. Our health care workers must, under the leadership of the Party, closely integrate with the masses in order to play their due role.
    Finally, let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, and forge ahead bravely for greater leap forward in 1960 and for more brilliant achievements in the people's health work.

    农村卫生保健工作的新面貌
    林巧稚和黄鼎臣委员的联合发言各位委员：
    我们拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，和政协全国委员会常务委员会陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会工作报告。
    我们这次参加政协全国委员会医药卫生参观团，于今年2、3月间到山西、河南等地进行参观，并着重参观了山西省晋南专区稷山县的卫生情况。现将这个县的卫生情况向大会汇报如下：
    稷山——农村卫生的一面红旗
    稷山县是一个土地肥沃、资源丰富、气候温暖、人民勤劳勇敢的好地方。但是在反动统治的年代里，人民过着非常贫困的生活，文化卫生状况更是十分落后悲惨。如这个县的翟店公社西位村在1943年曾因流行伤寒和霍乱等病，有27％的农户为治病而破产，一条二十六户七十二口人的小巷，竟死去十九人，五家绝了户。解放后，人民翻了身，成了生活的主人。随着生产的发展，人民物质文化生活不断地得到改善，卫生保健事业也有很大的发展和提高。但反动统治遗留下来十分落后的卫生状况，还没有彻底改变，直到1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，不仅生产取得了特大跃进，卫生工作也有了飞跃的发展；特别在公社化后，全县的卫生面貌发生了根本改观。我们参观团的同志都称赞稷山县卫生面貌变化之巨大、变化之神速。现在，这个县已成为全国农村卫生的一面红旗。
    稷山县的成就，首先表现在除害灭病方面，全县已经基本消灭了四害，我们所到的地方，根本没有发现四害，虱、蚤等也基本绝迹。他们不仅消灭了天花、疟疾、斑疹伤寒、霍乱、回归热等七种主要疾病，控制了麻疹、白喉、痢疾、流感等多发病，而且发展到普查普治一般疾病，仅1959年就治疗了砂眼、蛔虫、痔瘘、子宫颈炎、阴道滴虫等病患者八万五千七百多人。
    环境卫生也是令人非常满意的。所有的街道都修得平平坦坦干干净净。墙上都用石灰刷得雪白，还写着各种各样的卫生公约和制度。社员的住宅已经整修刷新，院里和屋里都非常整洁，一切东西摆得井井有序。而且还把卫生工作的基本建设用香化、绿化、美化，房屋街道的整修等建设社会主义新农村的工作结合起来。很多狭窄的小街小巷都加宽了，绝大部分街道已经栽植上各种小树。从街头到庭院，还种上各种美丽芬芳的花草。特别引我们注意的是公共厕所。它分设在村外四角的空地上，这里有椅子式的老人厕所、木马式的儿童厕所，使卫生安全化。全县应整修的厕所，已经有98％以上整修了。堆肥坑、粪便发酵场都经过了改良。
    他们关心人的卫生，进一步发展到对牲畜、家禽进行防疫保健工作。鸡有“三层楼”的现代化鸡窝。猪的“宿舍”就更美观了。我们参观过高标准的北方平管理区万头猪场，它们分槽住宿，而且有它们的“托儿所”、“食堂”、“澡堂”、“运动场”。这既保证了卫生，又保证了猪的生长和繁殖，还便于积肥。
    集体事业的卫生保健和劳动保护工作比上述环境卫生更令人满意。公共食堂的烧火和做饭是分开的，屋外烧火，屋里做饭，一点烟雾、尘灰也进不来，他们叫做“无尘灶”。用水时先经过滤水池。切菜分生菜和熟菜案，避免生菜的细菌传到熟菜上。食堂还设有流水洗手台、漱口水台、消毒水台、洗碗台。饭前饭后，社员们都能自觉洗手漱口。食堂还根据管理区供应各种不同的主副食品，定出一个食谱，按照规定的主副食品种类和数量做饭做菜，保证每人每天可以得到二千六百克以上的热量。全县普遍建立了缝纫组、洗衣组、洗脚池、洗澡塘。妇女们受到应有的关怀。孕妇产前半个月就搬进待产室，产后可以在产院休养一个月，而且有鸡蛋和红糖补贴。出院后婴儿可以放到哺乳室，免费供应羊奶，六个月后转托儿所。特别是贯彻“三调三不调”的制度（经期调干不调湿、孕期调轻不调重、哺乳期调近不调远）后，妇科病大大减少，受到社员的一致拥护。
    稷山县的卫生保健工作做得好，是同建立健全的卫生医疗保健网分不开的。在公社化后，他们及时地根据生产和生活集体化的特点，在新兴工厂、牧场、林场、水库、公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活和集体福利事业单位，建立了一个新的卫生医疗保健网。目前，县和各公社都有医院，每个管理区有保健站，每个生产队有保健室。医疗保健队伍不断发展，共培养提高了两万余名医疗保健人员。中医在卫生保健工作中起了很重要的作用，他们已经作到了“普通疾病不出社，一般小病不出区，工伤急病不出队”，“挂竿报病，医生上门，田间巡回，地头看病”。全县每人每户都建立了医疗卡片和保健档案。目前，全县正在大力推广太阳村的集体保健医疗制度。特别是普及全民卫生知识教育正在开展起来，去年冬季一次普及全民卫生教育运动中，有二十万人懂得了防治十五种以上的常见疾病的卫生常识。
    稷山县的卫生工作成就的另一个重要表现是人民精神面貌的改变。讲求卫生、破除迷信、相信科学已成为新的社会风尚。“有病求神拜佛”已经成了大家谈笑的资料，香炉变成了花盆。老太太们也讲求卫生，还组成了太极拳训练班。当我们去参观时，特别为我们作表演。不随地吐痰和乱扔纸屑、烟头和碎物已成了自觉的习惯。
    卫生工作为生产服务
    稷山县的卫生工作不是孤立进行的，而是坚持了以生产为中心，卫生工作从生产出发，紧密结合生产，为生产服务。因此，不仅卫生工作取得了辉煌的成就，提高了人民的体质，也大大促进了生产的发展。全县达到劳卫制一级、二级、少年级标准的将近三分之一人口，有一万多人达到了等级运动员。在一万一千四百多名长期慢性病患者中，有九千多人经治疗恢复了健康，投入了生产。正是由于人民体质的提高，身体健康，全县劳动出勤率经常保持在95％以上，有的村达到98％以上，从而有力地促进了生产的发展。全县在1958年和1959年，连续取得了农业生产的特大跃进，并且获得山西省小麦丰产模范县的光荣称号。
    目前，稷山县的卫生保健工作已经做到了
  “经常化、制度化、习惯化”，并且已由经常治标转到彻底治本，由消灭主要疾病、多发病转到普查、普治一般疾病，由治疗患者转到保护健康人，由个人卫生转到集体生活卫生，由整修环境庭院进入建设新农村，人们的精神面貌已焕然一新。
    人民公社给卫生保健工作带来了优越条件
    稷山县卫生保健面貌的变化是巨大的。从这些变化中，我们不仅可以看到全国卫生工作在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了巨大的成绩，而且可以满怀信心的展望全国农村卫生保健面貌，已经随着生产的不断跃进，正在发生深刻的变化，向着移风易俗、改造世界的目标迈进。
    稷山县的卫生工作并没有什么特殊的优越条件，但由于党委高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持多快好省发展卫生事业的方针，以不断革命的精神，加强宣传教育，充分发动群众，结合生产运动，大搞群众性的除害灭病卫生运动，特别是在最近两年来，从根本上改变了过去的落后面貌。稷山县的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，也是认真执行党的“面向工农兵，预防为主，团结中西医，卫生工作与群众运动相结合”卫生工作方针的结果。这一事实教育我们，卫生工作只要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和党的卫生工作方针，坚持大搞群众卫生运动，就一定能够不断地跃进再跃进，从胜利走向胜利，就可以提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”给予我们的除害灭病任务。
    稷山县的卫生保健工作所以取得巨大成就一个最主要保证，是人民公社发挥了无比的优越性，公社化前，全县仅有一个县医院，五个地区医院，十三个保健站，一百八十七个保健室。公社化后，才扩大了卫生保健网，发展到两个县医院，十二个公社医院，一百三十五个保健站，一千多个保健室。如果没有人民公社，这样成倍、几倍、十几倍的增加医疗保健单位是根本办不到的。目前，不仅群众就医方便，而且由于卫生保健组织的建立和生产组织相适应，大大便利了生产和卫生统一安排和密切结合。群众热情歌颂说：“保健室就是好，有病有伤都治了，不是公社化，梦也梦不到”、“人民公社关心人，咱们越干越带劲，劳保制度真正好，人们越活越精神”。随着人民公社的日益巩固和发展，充分发挥无比的威力，将给卫生保健工作带来更多的优越条件。卫生保健的发展，也将对人民公社起积极的促进作用。
    我们深深地感到这次参观是一课深刻的社会主义教育和学习。同时，更加体会到，知识分子必须加速进行自我改造。不仅要划清资产阶级和无产阶级的思想界限，而且要通过学习毛主席著作和马列主义，通过社会实践和参加劳动，树立坚强的无产阶级世界观，建立工人农民的感情。也只有这样，才能自觉地听党的话，同工人农民打成一片，有共同的语言，才能充分发挥自己的力量，为祖国的社会主义和共产主义建设事业作出应有的贡献。我们卫生医务人员，必须在党的领导下，密切与群众相结合，才能发挥应有的作用。
    最后，让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，为1960年取得更大的跃进，为人民卫生工作取得更辉煌的成就而奋勇前进。
