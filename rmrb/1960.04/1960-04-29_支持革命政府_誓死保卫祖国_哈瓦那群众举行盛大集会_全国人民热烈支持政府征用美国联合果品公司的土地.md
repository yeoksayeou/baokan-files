Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th: Thousands of men and women held a mass rally here in the Luiana district tonight to support the revolutionary government and express their determination to defend the Cuban revolution.

    This rally is the first in a series of rallies that will be held every night in various districts of Havana until the eve of May Day. These rallies are being held to mobilize the people to participate in the huge demonstration on May Day.
    The attendees constantly shouted slogans vowing to defend the motherland to the death and overthrowing American imperialism.
    Jesus Soto, Organizing Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, emphasized that on May 1st, the Cuban people will warn the arrogant and rude Eisenhower, who dared to insult Premier Castro by saying he had betrayed the revolution: the revolutionary government and the people are one and the same, and whoever insults the revolutionary leader insults the people of Cuba. The Cuban people will show on this day that they are holding rifles and ready to defend national independence against any aggressor.
    At the rally, a large number of letters and congratulatory messages from various trade union organizations and people's organizations expressing support for the Cuban revolution were read out. The Chinese trade union delegation also attended the rally.
    Speakers at the meeting also condemned the imperialists' conspiracy to create divisions among the Cuban working class and people under the pretext of anti-communism.
    Folk artists participating in the rally sang songs and danced. Youth patrols performed military drills.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th: The Cuban National Land Reform Committee formally requisitioned 8,000 caballeries of land belonging to the United Fruit Company's sugar company yesterday. A conference to implement the Land Reform Law was held yesterday at the Presicion Sugar Mill in Mayari, Oriente Province. At the meeting, the judge of first instance handed over the legal ownership of the land belonging to the United Fruit Company to the leader of the 24th Agricultural Development Zone of Oriente Province, representing the National Land Reform Committee. Many farmers and agricultural workers in the region attended the conference. Many trade union and peasant leaders spoke at the meeting, expressing their support for this measure. On the requisitioned land, agricultural workers will organize cooperatives.
    This American United Fruit Company, called the green vampire by the Cuban people, has been carrying out cruel exploitation of workers in Cuba and other Central American countries since the beginning of this century. In 1901, when Cuba was under the military control of the American interventionist government, this company plundered the most fertile land in Cuba in Mayari and Banes. It seized these lands from the farmers at the ridiculous "price" of ten cents per caballeria, driving out numerous farmers. Over the years, the company has extracted huge profits. However, when requisitioning the Cuban land plundered by the company, the National Land Reform Committee still paid 6,118,000 pesos in land reform bonds as compensation.
    The people of the whole country warmly welcome this measure. Agustin Velasquez, an agricultural worker of the company, said, "In the sixty years that I have worked for the United Fruit Company, I have only known poverty and exploitation. Now its exploitation is over. My children will have clothes and shoes to wear, and will get what we lacked. The American gentlemen can no longer take our land unless they kill all of us. We have organized militias and are prepared to defend the land and defend the revolution when they attack us."
    According to a recent announcement by Jimenez, director of the National Land Reform Committee, the land reform has entered its most important stage. Eighty thousand caballeries of sugarcane fields and two hundred million arrova of sugarcane have been handed over to 200,000 agricultural workers participating in sugarcane cooperatives. The more than 8,000 caballeries of land requisitioned from the United Fruit Company are included in the 80,000 caballeries of sugarcane fields of the large companies taken over, including the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company, the Francisco Sugar Mill, and the Bertiente Sugar Company.

    支持革命政府　誓死保卫祖国
    哈瓦那群众举行盛大集会
    全国人民热烈支持政府征用美国联合果品公司的土地
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　今天晚上，几千名男女在这里的路亚那区举行了支持革命政府和决心保卫古巴革命的群众集会。
    这次集会是到“五一”前夕为止每天晚上将在哈瓦那各区举行的一系列集会的第一个活动，举行这些集会是为了动员人民参加在“五一”节举行的巨大示威游行。
    到会者不断高呼誓死保卫祖国和打倒美帝国主义的口号。
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托强调指出，在5月1日，古巴人民将正告胆敢于侮辱卡斯特罗总理是叛变了革命的傲慢无礼的艾森豪威尔：革命政府和人民是一个整体，谁要侮辱革命领袖，也就是侮辱古巴的人民。古巴人民将在这一天表示：他们手持步枪，准备在任何侵略者面前捍卫民族的独立。
    在这次集会上，宣读了各工会组织和人民团体大量表示支持古巴革命的信件和贺词。中国工会代表团也出席了这次集会。
    在会上发言的人还谴责帝国主义者企图以反共为借口在古巴工人阶级和人民中间制造分裂的阴谋。
    参加集会的民间艺术家演唱了歌曲和舞蹈。青年巡逻队表演了军事操练。
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　古巴土地改革全国委员会昨天正式征用了美国联合果品公司所属糖业公司的八千卡瓦耶里亚的土地。在奥连特省马亚里的普雷西翁糖厂昨天举行了履行土地改革法的大会，会上，由初审法官把属于联合果品公司的土地的法律所有权交给了代表土地改革全国委员会的奥连特省第二十四农业开发区的领导人。参加大会的有这个地区的许多农民和农业工人。许多工会和农民领导人在会上发言，表示支持采取这个措施。在被征用的土地上，将由农业工人组织合作社。
    这家被古巴人民叫做绿色吸血鬼的美国联合果品公司从本世纪初起一直在古巴和其他中美国家对工人进行残酷的剥削。1901年古巴处在美国干涉政府的军事控制下，当时这家公司在马亚里和巴内斯掠夺了古巴最肥美的土地，它以每卡瓦耶里亚十分钱的可笑“价格”从农民手里夺取了这些土地，把众多的农民驱逐了出去。这许多年来，这家公司已榨取了巨额的利润。但在征用被这家公司掠夺的古巴土地时，土地改革全国委员会仍然付给六百一十一万八千比索的土地改革公债做为补偿。
    全国人民热烈欢迎这个措施。这家公司的农业工人阿古斯丁·贝拉斯克斯说，“在我为联合果品公司工作的六十年来，我只知道贫困和剥削。现在它的剥削结束了。我的孩子们将有衣服和鞋子穿，将得到我们所缺少的东西。美国先生们再想抢走我们的土地，除非把我们所有的人都杀死。我们已经组织了民兵，准备在他们进攻我们的时候，保卫土地和保卫革命。”
    据土地改革全国委员会主任希门尼斯最近宣布，土地改革已进入了最重要的阶段。八万卡瓦耶里亚甘蔗田和二亿阿罗瓦的甘蔗已经交给了参加甘蔗合作社的二十万农业工人。联合果品公司被征用的八千多卡瓦耶里亚土地包括在这八万卡瓦耶里亚的被接管的大公司的甘蔗田内，这些公司中有古巴大西洋糖公司，弗朗西斯科糖厂，贝尔蒂恩特糖公司。
